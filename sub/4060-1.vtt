01:22.631 --> 01:24.066
Good night.
Good night.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.201
Ah, there you are,
darlings.

01:26.268 --> 01:27.435
Did you miss mommy?

01:27.503 --> 01:29.304
3:00, Miss Manton.
Right on time.

01:29.371 --> 01:30.839
I went up
right after you called.

01:30.907 --> 01:32.774
I had to wake
your maid.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.011
Boy, was she fried-
I mean, angry.

01:36.079 --> 01:38.779
If I know Hilda, she
was fried, not angry.

01:38.847 --> 01:40.447
All right,
gentlemen.

01:40.515 --> 01:42.016
Remember, you're out here for exercise.

01:42.084 --> 01:43.483
No loafing.
Come on.

01:57.565 --> 01:59.399
Oh, what's the matter,
Tiger?

01:59.467 --> 02:02.502
Oh, poor little fella.

02:02.570 --> 02:05.505
There doesn't seem to
be any justice for dogs.

02:05.573 --> 02:07.708
You suffered through
the building of a subway,

02:07.775 --> 02:09.675
And when it's finished,
they won't even let you in.

02:20.388 --> 02:22.956
Ronny? Ronny!

04:04.855 --> 04:06.155
Hello, police?

04:15.965 --> 04:18.233
Hey, what is this,
a gag?

04:18.300 --> 04:19.834
No, sir. I was to a costume party.

04:19.902 --> 04:22.337
It was on 14th street
off 2nd avenue, and-

04:22.405 --> 04:24.973
Well, you see,
it was an artists' ball.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.642
I had to hit a man because
he tried to kiss me.

04:27.710 --> 04:30.412
And-Oh, no. I mean, the door was open,

04:30.480 --> 04:32.747
And I walked in,
and he was lying there

04:32.814 --> 04:34.214
In a pool of blood-
His own!

04:34.282 --> 04:36.216
Is that a reason to kill a man
- Because he tried to kiss you?

04:36.284 --> 04:38.686
Oh, it isn't the same
man, and I didn't kill him.

04:38.754 --> 04:39.820
Please, you've got
to believe me.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.188
It's just
up the street there.

04:41.256 --> 04:42.923
All right,
get in, get in.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.501
Wait a minute,
inspector.

04:53.568 --> 04:54.935
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Brent.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.836
Shouldn't you send two men
around the rear of the house?

04:56.904 --> 04:58.070
What for? The guy's
dead, isn't he?

04:58.138 --> 04:59.706
But the murderer might
still be in there.

04:59.774 --> 05:01.474
Look, lady. It's 10
minutes since you called us,

05:01.542 --> 05:02.776
And the murderer- That
is, if there is a murderer-

05:02.843 --> 05:04.611
Could be in Brooklyn
by now-

05:04.678 --> 05:05.845
That is, if anybody
wants to be in Brooklyn.

05:05.913 --> 05:07.747
Now let's take a look
at the body.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.749
Quit climbing up
on me.

05:09.817 --> 05:13.553
And listen, a few of you guys
go around the rear of the house.

05:15.322 --> 05:16.589
you know
whose house this is?

05:16.657 --> 05:18.324
It's the Lane mansion.

05:18.392 --> 05:19.858
Sheila Lane-You know, the one
who married the rich old banker.

05:19.926 --> 05:21.359
They haven't lived here
for a long time.

05:21.428 --> 05:22.928
Uh-Huh.
Where's the body?

05:22.995 --> 05:25.597
In that room. Now if you don't
mind, I’ll just run along.

05:25.665 --> 05:29.034
Sorry, lady. We'll have
to ask you to hang around.

05:33.105 --> 05:34.406
Why, it's gone!

05:34.474 --> 05:38.610
It was lying
right there.

05:38.678 --> 05:40.813
It's gone? It was lying right there?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.180
Yeah.

05:42.248 --> 05:43.281
Right over there?

05:48.153 --> 05:50.888
But I saw it, I swear
to you. He was dead.

05:50.956 --> 05:52.957
He was dead?

05:53.024 --> 05:55.593
I couldn't see his face
because he was lying on his-

05:55.661 --> 05:57.261
Now, you mustn't
be frightened.

05:57.329 --> 05:58.663
And my cloak- It was
hanging on the door-

05:58.730 --> 06:01.866
Don't get excited.
You're among friends.

06:01.934 --> 06:05.369
We've got a nice quiet
place in the country-

06:05.437 --> 06:06.471
She's not nuts.

06:06.538 --> 06:08.305
I'm not crazy,
I tell you.

06:08.373 --> 06:10.774
Maybe we can find something
in one of the other rooms.

06:10.842 --> 06:13.877
Yeah. We'll probably find
a mama ghost, a papa ghost,

06:13.945 --> 06:15.446
And a baby ghost.

06:15.513 --> 06:16.913
What kind of a game are you
playing? What's your name?

06:16.982 --> 06:18.349
Manton. Melsa Manton.

06:18.416 --> 06:22.186
Oh, Melsa Manton, eh?

06:22.253 --> 06:23.787
Aren't you one of the bunch that
held that treasure hunt last week

06:23.855 --> 06:25.356
And stole a traffic light?

06:25.423 --> 06:26.890
Oh, yes, but it was a
treasure hunt for charity.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.792
We run
the T.B. Clinic.

06:28.860 --> 06:31.095
And aren't you the dame who
got an ambulance from Bellevue

06:31.162 --> 06:32.728
Because one of your dogs
had distemper?

06:32.796 --> 06:34.930
He was very sick, and the
veterinary was out of town.

06:35.032 --> 06:37.066
And aren't you the dame
- Yes.

06:37.134 --> 06:38.301
Give me them
stomach tablets.

06:38.369 --> 06:40.470
Coming up, chief.

06:40.537 --> 06:41.471
There's a murderer
loose, I tell you,

06:41.538 --> 06:43.539
don't worry.
It won't fit him.

06:45.242 --> 06:47.410
Miss Manton, I don't
know what your game is,

06:47.478 --> 06:50.079
But I know this
- Either your education or your spanking

06:50.147 --> 06:51.947
Has been neglected.

06:52.016 --> 06:54.317
Now, I can't do anything about spanking you
- Or can I?

06:54.418 --> 06:56.951
You wouldn't dare!

06:57.020 --> 06:58.620
this time, I’ll
let you get away with it.

06:58.687 --> 07:00.655
But if you involve
the police department

07:00.723 --> 07:02.957
In one more
of your merry escapades,

07:03.026 --> 07:05.227
I'll lock you up
so tight,

07:05.294 --> 07:07.229
You'll need a major
earthquake to get you out.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.032
Now, go on home before
I call a truant officer.

07:10.099 --> 07:12.634
All right. If I ever
see another murder,

07:12.701 --> 07:15.003
Before I report it,
I hope-

07:15.071 --> 07:17.939
Well, I hope
I’m the victim.

07:18.007 --> 07:21.742
Chief, why can't I
use this, just this once?

07:21.809 --> 07:25.079
Because it's against
the law. Come on.

07:40.295 --> 07:42.696
Another batch of telegrams commending
your article on the Manton girl.

07:42.764 --> 07:45.698
That's fine.
Take another one.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.333
We should like to preface
this editorial

07:47.401 --> 07:50.136
With the statement that wall
street has hit a new low.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.939
Unemployment has reached
a new high peak.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.675
An additional $4 billion
has been added to the budget.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.078
But Miss Manton and her ilk

07:58.145 --> 08:01.548
Continue merrily on their
million-dollar Ermine-Lined way.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.015
Make a note-According
to the police,

08:03.084 --> 08:05.151
Miss Manton's costume
was fetching.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.652
It seems to me
that this young lady was-

08:07.788 --> 08:08.754
Are you Peter Ames?

08:08.822 --> 08:09.789
No.
But I am.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.757
To complete
the circle.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.858
Why, you-

08:12.960 --> 08:16.596
Oh! Oh!

08:21.434 --> 08:24.637
I'm sorry, miss. Will
you please stop crying?

08:24.705 --> 08:26.739
I'm not crying.
I'm just mad.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.708
Did you write
this awful thing?

08:28.775 --> 08:29.742
Yes.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.745
Oh, you're Melsa Manton. You
can afford your own laundry.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.313
It's quite an item
with me.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.515
I'm sorry, Miss Manton.
I'm a very busy man.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.217
How dare you print
such tripe.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.952
It's not a question
of courage.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.120
It's a question of
conviction, of policy.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.089
I see. And who decides
that policy?

08:44.155 --> 08:46.825
Well, newspapers are funny
institutions, Miss Manton.

08:46.892 --> 08:49.127
You take an ordinary reporter
like me and make him an editor,

08:49.194 --> 08:51.395
As long as he's willing to
work for the same salary.

08:51.463 --> 08:53.131
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

08:53.198 --> 08:56.133
Mr. Spengler. Mr. Ames, Mr. Spengler.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.002
I'd be charmed
if I wasn't so busy.

08:58.069 --> 08:59.302
If you both
will excuse me-

08:59.370 --> 09:01.105
Here's the summons,
Mr. Ames.

09:01.172 --> 09:02.706
I hope you don't
take this personal.

09:02.774 --> 09:04.908
That will be all,
Mr. Spengler.

09:04.976 --> 09:07.477
All right. Thank you,
Miss Manton.

09:09.614 --> 09:11.414
A million dollars
for libel.

09:11.482 --> 09:13.050
With your present income,
aren't you afraid

09:13.118 --> 09:15.653
That's going to put your income
tax way up into the surtax brackets?

09:15.720 --> 09:18.122
Don't worry about it. I'll
give it away to charity.

09:18.189 --> 09:20.990
This is all very silly. You
haven't a leg to stand on.

09:21.091 --> 09:23.325
That editorial
just stated facts.

09:23.393 --> 09:25.227
You did disrupt the police
force. There was no corpse.

09:25.295 --> 09:27.063
There was a corpse,
and I’ll prove it

09:27.131 --> 09:29.032
If I have to find
the body myself.

09:29.099 --> 09:30.399
You talk as if you were
contemplating murder.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.201
Don't encourage me.

09:35.238 --> 09:36.873
That editorial really started something.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.575
So did
Mrs. O’Leary’s cow.

09:39.643 --> 09:41.978
Call our attorneys
right away.

09:42.046 --> 09:44.746
We can't sit back complacently
and let them ridicule us.

09:44.814 --> 09:45.814
They might occasionally mention

09:45.882 --> 09:46.715
Some of
the good we do.

09:46.783 --> 09:48.550
That's not the point.

09:48.617 --> 09:50.152
There's no truth
in the stuff he printed,

09:50.219 --> 09:52.287
And it's up to us
as a group to prove it.

09:52.354 --> 09:53.855
I've always wanted
to pound a picket line.

09:53.923 --> 09:56.591
Now, Melsa, you remember the
night you saw Queen Elizabeth-

09:56.659 --> 09:58.827
In all her clothes, taking
a bath in your own tub.

09:58.895 --> 10:00.128
Are you suggesting,
by any chance,

10:00.196 --> 10:02.297
That I had too many
absinthe parfaits?

10:02.364 --> 10:04.465
We must exhaust
all possibilities

10:04.533 --> 10:06.367
Before we devote our
lives to a corpse-Hunt.

10:06.435 --> 10:07.802
After all, darling,
you're the only one

10:07.869 --> 10:09.503
Who says
there was a murder.

10:09.571 --> 10:12.306
I did see the body, and my cloak
certainly didn't run off by itself.

10:12.373 --> 10:14.008
Maybe the body
wasn't dead.

10:14.076 --> 10:15.609
I would have told the police
that you saw Ronny Beldon

10:15.677 --> 10:16.977
Coming out of
the Lane house.

10:17.045 --> 10:18.612
I didn't
have a chance.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.981
I think it's foolish to get any
more mixed up in this murder.

10:21.049 --> 10:22.616
No, it isn't.
Melsa's right.

10:22.684 --> 10:25.820
If we don't do something quickly,
the whole town will believe

10:25.887 --> 10:27.855
Everything Ames and that stupid
police inspector said about us.

10:27.956 --> 10:29.890
I think it's silly,
but I’m with you.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.025
Me, too. Count me in. Same here.

10:32.093 --> 10:34.695
That's swell, girls. I've
called Ronny Beldon's apartment,

10:34.762 --> 10:37.130
And the switchboard operator says
he won't be in till late tonight.

10:37.198 --> 10:38.932
Meanwhile, I have
some flashlights.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.767
Let's all go over
to the Lane house.

10:40.835 --> 10:42.336
I'll prove
I’m not crazy.

10:44.239 --> 10:46.172
Can't we prove you're not
crazy some other night?

10:46.241 --> 10:48.575
Sure. We'll ask the murderer
not to touch a thing.

10:48.643 --> 10:49.776
Telephone for you, miss frost.

10:49.844 --> 10:51.745
There's my date.

10:51.812 --> 10:53.380
Sounds like a pipsqueak
to me.

10:53.448 --> 10:56.549
Hello, pipsqueak?
I mean, hello, Paul.

10:56.617 --> 10:58.651
No, I can't.

10:58.719 --> 11:00.753
Well, just a minute.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.955
Please, not tonight!

11:03.022 --> 11:05.924
Oh! Hello?

11:05.992 --> 11:08.527
Hello? Hello?

11:08.595 --> 11:10.630
Are you there?

11:10.697 --> 11:12.030
He was cut off.

11:12.098 --> 11:13.332
Poor boy, and in the prime
of his life, too.

11:14.568 --> 11:15.834
Hilda, the door.

11:15.902 --> 11:18.237
I heard it.
I ain't deaf.

11:18.305 --> 11:20.372
Sometimes I wished
I was.

11:20.439 --> 11:21.906
Have you another piece of cake, Hilda?

11:21.974 --> 11:24.041
Yes, I have, but the
kitchen's closed for the night.

11:24.109 --> 11:25.777
Hilda, Miss Beverly
is our guest.

11:25.844 --> 11:27.145
I didn't ask her.

11:27.212 --> 11:28.346
Comes the revolution,

11:28.414 --> 11:30.448
And we'll stop being
exploited by our help.

11:30.516 --> 11:32.250
In my house,
the revolution is here.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.386
Look, I
- I was told to give this

11:34.453 --> 11:35.987
To Miss Manton
personally.

11:36.054 --> 11:37.255
You're Miss Manton? Yes. Thanks.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.657
The sender requests an answer, please.

11:38.724 --> 11:39.991
"May I come up
and see you?

11:40.058 --> 11:42.394
Just want half-hour of
your time. Peter Ames. "

11:42.461 --> 11:43.860
That's our publicity
agent.

11:43.928 --> 11:45.496
Have him up. We'll give him
something to write about.

11:45.563 --> 11:46.830
The answer is no.

11:46.898 --> 11:50.301
In that case, here's
another telegram for you.

11:50.368 --> 11:51.935
Ok, child.

11:52.003 --> 11:52.869
You'd think they'd send an older man

11:52.937 --> 11:54.004
Up to this
here apartment.

11:54.071 --> 11:55.939
"I'm coming up anyway.
Peter Ames. "

11:56.007 --> 11:57.541
Too bad we won't
be here to greet him.

11:57.609 --> 12:00.177
I'd better call
the lanes at their hotel

12:00.244 --> 12:03.714
So they won't surprise us
at the old house.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.649
What'll I say?
Say hello.

12:05.717 --> 12:07.784
Thanks, Dora. You're
sweet and very helpful.

12:07.851 --> 12:09.885
Mr. Lane, please.

12:09.953 --> 12:12.422
Well, then Mrs. Lane.

12:12.489 --> 12:15.991
Did she?
Did she take a bag?

12:16.059 --> 12:17.327
Thank you very much.

12:17.394 --> 12:18.928
George Lane
is out of town.

12:18.995 --> 12:21.364
Sheila left yesterday after
dinner and hasn't been back since.

12:21.432 --> 12:22.898
Do you suppose she and
Ronny Beldon skipped?

12:22.966 --> 12:24.367
You've heard
about those two.

12:24.435 --> 12:26.235
I don't know which is more pernicious
- You or anemia.

12:27.338 --> 12:28.371
That'll be your editor.

12:28.439 --> 12:29.706
Duck your
flashlights.

12:29.773 --> 12:32.106
Remember, girls, I want
the first stab at him.

12:32.174 --> 12:33.575
Now don't be
selfish, Melsa.

12:33.643 --> 12:36.277
Oh! My cloak.

12:36.346 --> 12:39.314
"the next time
you'll be in it. "

12:39.382 --> 12:43.151
Oh! The murderer
has been here!

12:43.219 --> 12:44.419
Why didn't I
keep that date?

12:44.487 --> 12:45.587
What'll we do?

12:45.655 --> 12:46.955
I don't know.
Think for yourself.

12:47.022 --> 12:48.690
Whoever committed
the murder did this

12:48.758 --> 12:50.191
And is afraid we may
know something.

12:50.259 --> 12:51.526
That knife ain't
folding them letters.

12:51.594 --> 12:52.861
We can't let this
intimidate us.

12:52.928 --> 12:54.162
That's what
the murderer wants.

12:54.230 --> 12:55.163
It's all the more
reason-

12:56.631 --> 12:57.197
He's come back!

12:57.265 --> 12:58.466
And I’m leaving!

12:58.533 --> 12:59.533
I'm going to open
the door.

12:59.601 --> 13:00.968
Get ready, girls.
We'll rush him.

13:02.404 --> 13:03.838
Oh.

13:03.905 --> 13:05.873
Very nice props, but
they don't convince me.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.442
You fool! You ruined
the fingerprints.

13:08.510 --> 13:10.678
Did I? I can get you
plenty more fingerprints.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.413
Miss Manton,
I came up to see

13:12.481 --> 13:14.482
If I couldn't talk you
out of this childishness.

13:14.549 --> 13:15.916
You can't
possibly win.

13:15.984 --> 13:17.418
Besides, it'll just make a
lot of trouble for both of us.

13:17.486 --> 13:18.853
come on, girls.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.886
Hi-ho, silver.

13:19.953 --> 13:21.053
Nasty man.

13:21.121 --> 13:22.955
I'll take mine
in one-Dollar bills.

13:23.023 --> 13:24.424
Rigor mortis
is setting in.

13:24.492 --> 13:25.625
He's cute.

13:25.693 --> 13:26.593
Oh!

13:30.598 --> 13:31.765
Come on.

13:35.536 --> 13:39.138
Oh, it's locked. Why don't the
police mind their own business?

13:39.206 --> 13:40.373
You can't say
we didn't try.

13:40.441 --> 13:42.909
Wait a second.
I'll try the window.

13:43.010 --> 13:44.376
Let's go home.

13:44.444 --> 13:45.377
Come on,
Melsa.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.237
This is the room.

14:13.305 --> 14:15.105
Go over it
with a fine-tooth comb.

14:15.173 --> 14:16.674
I found the clip
out in the foyer.

14:16.742 --> 14:18.275
There might be some other
things lying around-

14:18.343 --> 14:21.278
Bloodstains,
maybe fingerprints,

14:21.346 --> 14:23.448
Or things knocked over
in the struggle.

14:26.685 --> 14:27.618
I'm scared.

14:42.399 --> 14:44.901
Melsa, where did you
find the body?

14:44.969 --> 14:46.837
Right where
you're standing.

14:48.372 --> 14:49.405
Aah!

14:49.474 --> 14:50.740
Melsa, let's
get out of here.

14:50.842 --> 14:52.943
Oh, please
be quiet.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.683
What on earth
are you doing?

15:00.750 --> 15:02.284
I'm calling Paul.

15:02.352 --> 15:04.553
Silly, the thing has been
disconnected for a year.

15:04.621 --> 15:07.322
Look. Blood.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.424
I found a bloodstain.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.594
Oh, how can that be blood? It's blue.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.762
Maybe they shot
Mrs. Astor.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.432
No, it's ink. Somebody must
have spilled a bottle of ink.

15:19.469 --> 15:21.503
Helen, you search
the upstairs.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.838
Oh, no. I was never
much of an individualist.

15:23.906 --> 15:26.508
If the upstairs has to be
searched, we'll search it together.

15:26.575 --> 15:28.376
Why, that's communism! Shh!

15:28.443 --> 15:29.944
I don't know why
we have to whisper.

15:30.012 --> 15:30.912
There's nobody else
in this old barn.

15:37.920 --> 15:42.189
Turn off
your flashlights.

15:42.257 --> 15:43.690
I'll keep mine on.
I'm scared.

15:43.758 --> 15:45.425
Stand back
against the wall.

15:45.493 --> 15:47.561
When he comes in,
we'll all pounce on him.

16:23.030 --> 16:24.163
Aah!
Ow!

16:24.230 --> 16:25.397
Get him, girls!

16:25.465 --> 16:28.300
see if he's
got a gun first!

16:39.912 --> 16:42.413
hey! Hey!

16:45.685 --> 16:47.619
well, if it
isn't dopey.

16:47.687 --> 16:49.588
Don't be a pig, Myra.
Move over.

16:49.655 --> 16:51.255
Got a little worried,
didn't you?

16:51.323 --> 16:53.224
Thought there might be
something to my story after all.

16:53.292 --> 16:56.326
Wait till you dressmaker's
dummies read my next editorial.

16:57.862 --> 16:59.296
I still think
he's cute.

16:59.363 --> 17:01.098
Meaning no disloyalty
to you, Melsa.

17:01.165 --> 17:03.634
Come on, girls. We've still
got some unfinished business.

17:03.702 --> 17:05.669
You don't expect us to go to
Ronny Beldon's looking this way?

17:05.737 --> 17:06.704
Come on.

17:06.771 --> 17:10.507
Help! Help! Help!

17:10.575 --> 17:13.042
bye, darling.

17:13.111 --> 17:14.578
Hurry up!

17:20.951 --> 17:24.954
Let me do the questioning. Mr.
Beldon has a lot of explaining to do.

17:25.055 --> 17:26.856
He can't cut me dead
in the street,

17:26.924 --> 17:29.859
Even if he was
running away from a murder.

17:29.927 --> 17:32.762
He should have been
back by now.

17:34.832 --> 17:37.000
Oh...

17:37.067 --> 17:38.968
It's unlocked.

17:41.672 --> 17:43.572
It doesn't seem right to
go into a man's apartment

17:43.640 --> 17:45.340
Without a chaperon.

17:46.575 --> 17:48.744
Ronny?

17:48.811 --> 17:50.545
He doesn't seem
to be here.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.014
Let's see if we can
find anything.

17:52.081 --> 17:54.082
Look for anything that might
connect him with the murder.

17:54.150 --> 17:57.853
And don't disturb a thing. We don't want
him to know we've searched the place.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.735
Helen, come here a minute.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.370
Notice anything?

18:16.437 --> 18:17.705
It's a picture of Sheila Lane, isn't it?

18:17.773 --> 18:19.006
Yes, but you see
that clip?

18:19.074 --> 18:20.107
The one I
described to you-

18:20.175 --> 18:21.475
The same one I found
in the Lane house.

18:21.543 --> 18:23.177
Which means Sheila must
have been there, too.

18:23.244 --> 18:24.444
right.

18:24.512 --> 18:25.846
I just saw that clip
or its twin sister

18:25.914 --> 18:27.648
A minute ago
in the bedroom.

18:30.752 --> 18:33.419
I thought I told you girls
not to disturb anything.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.888
here it is.

18:36.290 --> 18:37.791
It is the same.

18:37.858 --> 18:39.559
I put this clip
in my cloak last night.

18:39.626 --> 18:40.894
When I went out
to call the police,

18:40.961 --> 18:42.361
Ronny must
have gone back,

18:42.429 --> 18:43.763
Taken the body
and my cloak.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.033
Do you suppose Ronny could
have been the murderer?

18:47.134 --> 18:49.736
Why, I can't
believe it.

18:51.138 --> 18:52.505
Come on. Let's get
out of here.

18:55.142 --> 18:56.608
Where's pat?

18:56.676 --> 18:58.376
She wouldn't by any chance
be in the kitchen, would she?

18:58.444 --> 19:01.180
Pat? Oh, pat!

19:03.482 --> 19:04.850
Come on, pat.
We're leaving.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.284
I'll be with you
in a minute.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.986
Let me see
that knife.

19:08.054 --> 19:09.722
I'm hungry. I want to make a sandwich.

19:09.789 --> 19:12.424
Oh, pat, let me
have that. Oh, stop.

19:12.491 --> 19:15.894
what's
going on in here?

19:15.962 --> 19:17.830
If I’m not mistaken, this
is the mate to the knife

19:17.897 --> 19:20.264
That was sticking
in my door.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.299
This cinches it.
It's Ronny, all right.

19:22.367 --> 19:25.103
And I had him
up to tea.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.771
Now we'd better get
out of here. Come on.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.106
Not until I’ve
had my sandwich.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.007
Oh, pat, come on.

19:32.144 --> 19:34.311
Aaah!

19:34.412 --> 19:36.080
It's Ronny!

19:36.148 --> 19:37.481
Oh!

19:37.582 --> 19:39.350
My heavens!

19:39.417 --> 19:41.652
Wait a minute, girls.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.054
We can't leave pat
in there.

19:43.122 --> 19:45.088
I'm not going
back in there.

19:45.156 --> 19:46.389
Isn't she brave?

19:46.457 --> 19:47.891
And we all thought Ronny did it.

19:47.959 --> 19:50.761
I have a psychic feeling
we're all moths to slaughter.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.436
There you are.
Afraid of a dead man.

20:00.504 --> 20:03.439
Why, I-Oh!

20:05.409 --> 20:07.277
Break into the joint
sharp on the hour.

20:07.344 --> 20:09.344
Don't bother with the guests.
Just get the croupiers.

20:09.412 --> 20:11.647
And remember, I don't want to find
any chips in your vest pockets.

20:11.714 --> 20:14.516
Lieutenant, there's a dame who
wants to speak to you on the phone.

20:14.584 --> 20:16.551
A dame, eh?

20:18.955 --> 20:21.290
Hello.

20:21.357 --> 20:23.859
Manton? Sullivan,
get a bicarb tablet ready.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.460
Coming up, chief.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.362
Look here, Miss Manton. We
realize we're public servants,

20:27.430 --> 20:29.564
But do you
realize it?

20:29.632 --> 20:32.300
Oh, you found
another body?

20:32.367 --> 20:34.169
Uh-Huh.

20:34.270 --> 20:36.337
I see.

20:36.405 --> 20:38.072
Well, I’ll tell you
what to do.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.641
Keep it on ice, see?

20:40.709 --> 20:42.743
It is on ice?

20:42.812 --> 20:45.479
Look here, Miss Manton. Get
out of my life, do you hear?

20:45.547 --> 20:46.915
Get out of my life!

21:00.829 --> 21:03.831
All about the murder.
Playboy murdered.

21:03.898 --> 21:05.732
Body found
in Clarion lobby.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.801
All about it! Extra!

21:07.869 --> 21:08.768
Let's have it.

21:08.837 --> 21:10.670
Oh, hello, Mr. Ames.

21:10.738 --> 21:12.405
Say, what happened
to you?

21:12.473 --> 21:15.742
I've just been initiated
into the junior league.

21:15.810 --> 21:16.844
What's this?

21:16.911 --> 21:18.445
I wouldn't know,
Mr. Ames.

21:18.512 --> 21:20.713
I'm just on
the distribution end.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.249
Hey, extra! Read all
about the big murder.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.220
Hey, Pete, I never
expected

21:27.287 --> 21:28.387
A double-cross
from you.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.421
I don't know anything
about it.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.923
What's
this all about?

21:30.991 --> 21:32.058
I get into headquarters,
and this hits me in the face.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.826
I don't know, Mike.
I wasn't in the office.

21:33.894 --> 21:36.295
I was tied up
until now.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.998
will you stop
crawling up on me?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.935
What a scoop! We have 100,000
papers on the street already.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.904
Why weren't
the police notified?

21:45.972 --> 21:48.240
We wanted to get our papers
out on the street first.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.176
If any more bodies are found around
here, notify the police first.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.810
If it ain't asking too much,
what did you do with the body?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.712
He's in your office
on the couch.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.882
What are you trying
to do, haunt my couch?!

22:02.588 --> 22:05.957
I, uh... dropped in
to the Lane mansion tonight.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.824
I ran into Manton
and a flock of her friends.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.860
Ran into them? Looks
like you met them head-on.

22:09.928 --> 22:13.130
I heard them say something about
going over to his apartment.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.932
Round up that pack of dames
running around with Manton.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.367
Bring them down
to headquarters.

22:16.434 --> 22:17.434
Drag them out of bed
if you have to.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.969
Ok, and I hope
I have to.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.437
Come on.
We'll pick up Manton.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.805
Wait a minute, Mike. Aren't
you being a little hasty?

22:21.873 --> 22:23.173
Why don't you wait
till morning?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.142
Do you think
I like to do this?

22:25.210 --> 22:27.211
Do you think I like to
take people, men and women,

22:27.279 --> 22:29.079
Human beings,
and harass them,

22:29.147 --> 22:31.714
Pound them, beat them,
humiliate them?

22:31.782 --> 22:35.118
No. But to these girls,
I’m gonna love it!

22:37.587 --> 22:39.022
fire!

22:39.089 --> 22:40.689
I’d confess
for a sandwich.

22:40.757 --> 22:41.925
confess what?

22:41.992 --> 22:43.659
It depends
on the sandwich.

22:43.727 --> 22:47.297
Quiet, girls. That nice policeman
has thought up another question.

22:47.364 --> 22:49.432
Why did you take the body
down to the Clarion?

22:49.499 --> 22:50.466
I thought if you
read it in the paper,

22:50.534 --> 22:51.767
You'd believe it.

22:51.835 --> 22:53.803
Miss Manton, we've been here all night.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.472
You're tired. I'm tired.
The girls are tired.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.674
All I’m asking is
a simple question.

22:58.742 --> 23:01.176
Which one of you girls
murdered Ronny Beldon?

23:01.244 --> 23:03.245
And who's covering up
for who?

23:03.313 --> 23:04.947
Now, is that
too much to ask?

23:05.014 --> 23:06.449
I've told you before,
inspector-

23:06.516 --> 23:08.083
Lieutenant.

23:08.151 --> 23:09.318
I told you that
the only reason

23:09.385 --> 23:10.553
We went to
Ronny Beldon's apartment

23:10.620 --> 23:12.822
Was because I saw
Ronny Beldon

23:12.889 --> 23:14.156
Come out
of the Lane house.

23:14.223 --> 23:15.257
Now will you let me
call my lawyer?

23:15.325 --> 23:16.425
No!

23:16.493 --> 23:17.326
Just a minute,
sergeant.

23:17.393 --> 23:18.461
Lieutenant.

23:18.528 --> 23:19.661
Lieutenant, I have
something to say.

23:19.728 --> 23:20.829
Yeah?

23:20.964 --> 23:22.864
I think he
committed suicide.

23:22.932 --> 23:26.601
Oh, you do, do you? Well, I
think you got something there.

23:26.669 --> 23:29.137
He tiptoed into the
refrigerator, closed the door,

23:29.205 --> 23:31.639
And stuck a knife
into himself. Uhh!

23:31.707 --> 23:33.075
Come on, chief.

23:37.413 --> 23:40.949
Won't-Who asked you
for it?

23:41.017 --> 23:43.784
Won't somebody please
cooperate and confess?

23:43.852 --> 23:47.054
I can't stand it any longer!
I'll confess! I did it!

23:47.122 --> 23:48.522
You did? Why'd you
do it?

23:48.590 --> 23:51.892
Because you asked me
to cooperate with you.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.195
Now, look at me.
I'm a sick man.

23:54.296 --> 23:55.629
My stomach
is on the blink.

23:55.697 --> 23:57.164
It's easy for me
to get sick,

23:57.232 --> 23:58.265
But I want to get
sick my own way!

23:58.333 --> 24:00.434
Wait a minute, Mike.
I'll take it.

24:00.502 --> 24:02.736
Miss Manton, I don't happen
to agree with lieutenant Brent.

24:02.804 --> 24:04.105
I don't think
any of you girls did it.

24:04.172 --> 24:07.007
But you are hiding
something.

24:07.074 --> 24:08.875
Now, Melsa,
why don't you tell us?

24:08.942 --> 24:10.610
Miss Manton
is the name.

24:10.677 --> 24:12.945
You made liars and social
parasites out of us.

24:13.014 --> 24:16.149
Now we girls are going to collect
that million dollars from you.

24:16.217 --> 24:17.683
And as for you,
inspector Brent,

24:17.751 --> 24:19.552
False arrest is a very
serious charge,

24:19.620 --> 24:22.022
And we'll have your badge
before we're through with you.

24:22.089 --> 24:24.790
We're going to make you all
feel pretty small and silly.

24:24.858 --> 24:26.292
Who's got a lipstick?

24:26.360 --> 24:27.660
All right.
Fingerprint them

24:27.728 --> 24:28.828
And put them
in the lineup.

24:28.896 --> 24:30.696
And on what charges
are you going to hold us?

24:30.764 --> 24:32.665
For spitting
on the sidewalk.

24:32.733 --> 24:34.901
Lieutenant, there's a lawyer out
here with a writ of habeas corpus

24:34.968 --> 24:36.135
For the dames.

24:36.202 --> 24:37.770
Well, it's
about time.

24:37.838 --> 24:40.472
All right, all right. And if
you dames find another body,

24:40.607 --> 24:42.207
It'll probably be me.

24:42.275 --> 24:44.977
Popsy! Oh, are we glad to see you.

24:45.045 --> 24:47.747
Girls, you ought to have
more consideration for my age.

24:47.814 --> 24:49.181
Who told you
we were in jail?

24:49.249 --> 24:52.151
A chap named Ames.
Uh, Peter Ames.

24:52.218 --> 24:53.553
A light begins
to dawn.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.753
What do you mean?

24:54.820 --> 24:55.987
After all, when a man
calls Melsa "Melsa"-

24:56.055 --> 24:57.622
Oh, don't be silly.

24:57.690 --> 25:00.058
You know, psychiatrists say
hate's just a step away from love.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.192
Yeah, but it's the lull in
between that drives you crazy.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.594
Come on, Popsy.

25:18.177 --> 25:19.444
Thanks.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.413
What for?

25:22.481 --> 25:25.950
For calling my lawyer.
Why did you do it?

25:26.017 --> 25:30.088
Maybe I’m a social climber
or a fortune hunter.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.290
Or maybe I’m beginning
to like you very much.

25:32.424 --> 25:34.792
Anyway...

25:34.859 --> 25:36.694
I realize I should
let go of your hand,

25:36.761 --> 25:38.496
But the fact is, I’m
finding I don't want to.

25:40.399 --> 25:41.932
You've been
very sweet. Thanks.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.933
When can I see you
again?

25:46.404 --> 25:48.037
Meet me in Sheila Lane's
apartment at 3:00.

25:48.106 --> 25:48.905
There'll be a big
story for you.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.140
Sheila Lane?

25:50.208 --> 25:51.374
Yes. I found her clip
in the Lane mansion

25:51.442 --> 25:52.609
When I discovered
the body.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.612
All right, Melsa.
Come on.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.280
Pat's hungry,
and we're sleepy.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.915
Good-bye,
until 3:00.

26:06.557 --> 26:09.125
Well, that's one way of
getting favorable publicity.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.093
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:11.161 --> 26:12.794
Come on. Out. Out.

26:12.862 --> 26:13.729
Now what's
the matter?

26:13.796 --> 26:15.197
You're under arrest.

26:15.265 --> 26:16.165
This is where I came in.

26:16.233 --> 26:18.267
Come on.
Give me that clip.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.171
You unspeakable
Judas.

26:22.239 --> 26:23.172
Now, Melsa-

26:23.240 --> 26:24.273
Don't call me Melsa.

26:24.341 --> 26:25.874
This isn't any
pink tea.

26:25.942 --> 26:27.109
That knife in your door was no joke,

26:27.177 --> 26:28.544
Even if I
thought it was.

26:28.612 --> 26:29.545
Are you gonna give me-
What knife?

26:29.613 --> 26:31.013
I'll tell you later.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.847
This is murder. Neither
the police department nor I

26:32.914 --> 26:34.315
Want to wake up
some morning

26:34.383 --> 26:35.783
And find 8 lovely
debutantes murdered.

26:35.851 --> 26:37.252
You know, he makes sense to me.

26:37.319 --> 26:40.255
Are you gonna
give me that clip?

26:40.322 --> 26:41.456
Here.

26:41.524 --> 26:42.823
Withholding
evidence, eh?

26:46.562 --> 26:48.863
Covered Beldon's apartment.
Couldn't find a thing.

26:48.930 --> 26:50.398
Anything new?

26:50.466 --> 26:51.432
Yeah. Looks like Sheila Lane
done her boyfriend in.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.767
We just got an alarm
out for her.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.002
Hey, Mike, what
about old man Lane?

26:55.070 --> 26:56.570
What about him?

26:56.638 --> 26:58.405
If our paper knew his wife
was running around with Beldon,

26:58.473 --> 27:00.106
He must have known.

27:00.175 --> 27:03.143
Maybe he killed Beldon and
tossed his wife in the river.

27:03.211 --> 27:06.680
Hey, maybe you got something
there. Get an alarm out for-

27:06.747 --> 27:08.382
I hate to spoil
a good story,

27:08.449 --> 27:10.116
But Mr. Thomas, his partner, told me

27:10.185 --> 27:11.851
That Lane has
been out of town

27:11.919 --> 27:12.786
For the past week on business.

27:12.853 --> 27:15.255
Did he? Get that alarm
out for Lane.

27:15.323 --> 27:16.756
That's Beldon's car
- It's been standing outside his house

27:16.824 --> 27:17.757
For two days.

27:17.825 --> 27:19.692
Ok. You catch some sleep.

27:19.759 --> 27:22.328
I'm taking these dames
back to Beldon's apartment.

27:22.396 --> 27:24.963
I'll make them talk if I have
to keep them awake all summer.

27:25.031 --> 27:26.732
Now he thinks
he's general grant.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.967
Shut up. Hey, you.
Follow us.

27:29.035 --> 27:30.736
We'll use the Beldon car.
You come with me.

27:30.804 --> 27:32.305
Let go of my arm.

27:32.372 --> 27:35.441
Wait a minute. You girls
hop in the rumble seat.

27:35.509 --> 27:37.677
Ames, you'll ride
with me.

27:39.346 --> 27:41.947
Aah! Aah!

27:42.015 --> 27:43.481
Aah!

27:43.549 --> 27:45.116
Shut up!

27:45.184 --> 27:48.486
That's the body! That's the
body I saw in the Lane house!

27:54.460 --> 27:56.661
Old man Lane.

27:56.729 --> 27:59.063
Right on my own
doorstep.

27:59.131 --> 28:00.832
It's contempt of court.

28:09.907 --> 28:12.876
Oh, it's you. I told you on
the phone she won't go with you.

28:12.944 --> 28:15.145
Now, Hilda, I just
want to talk to her.

28:15.213 --> 28:16.413
She don't want to talk
to you.

28:16.481 --> 28:18.382
She even made me
stop buying your paper.

28:18.450 --> 28:21.318
And besides, someone's coming
to take her to the charity ball.

28:21.386 --> 28:23.654
I'll force my way in.

28:23.722 --> 28:24.722
If you do, she told me to throw
a pitcher of water

28:24.789 --> 28:25.889
Plumb in your face.

28:25.957 --> 28:27.824
I'll risk it.

28:31.062 --> 28:34.864
It was orders,
but I used distilled water.

28:34.931 --> 28:38.033
Do you and Melsa live
this way all the time?

28:38.101 --> 28:39.902
Well, I done my best.
She's in the living room,

28:39.970 --> 28:42.305
But I warn you, y'all
better not go in there.

28:42.373 --> 28:46.542
She's in a nasty mood, and when I
says nasty, I ain't mincing words.

28:46.610 --> 28:49.479
Hilda, I thought
I told you to keep him out.

28:49.546 --> 28:52.114
Melsa, please. I've never
run after a woman before-

28:52.182 --> 28:53.383
That is, I’ve never
admitted it-

28:53.450 --> 28:54.651
But I’m running
after you.

28:54.752 --> 28:57.386
You're on
a treadmill, Mr. Ames.

28:57.453 --> 29:01.122
You may keep on running, but
you'll remain in the same spot.

29:01.223 --> 29:02.991
Hilda, for Pete’s sake,
will you get out of here?

29:03.058 --> 29:05.761
I've got things to say. I can't say them
when you're standing there staring at me.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.462
Hilda, you stay
right where you are.

29:07.530 --> 29:10.565
You don't know
what's good for you.

29:10.633 --> 29:14.269
Listen, before I knew you,
I disliked you intensely.

29:14.337 --> 29:16.171
When I met you,
I disliked you intensely.

29:16.238 --> 29:18.307
Even now, I dislike
you intensely-

29:18.374 --> 29:22.209
That is, the sensible,
sane portion of me.

29:22.277 --> 29:24.945
But there's an insane side of
me that gets a little violent

29:25.013 --> 29:27.381
Every time
I think of you.

29:27.449 --> 29:28.982
Getting rid of a million-dollar lawsuit

29:29.050 --> 29:30.918
Wouldn't have
anything to do

29:30.985 --> 29:32.886
With your change in affection, would it?

29:32.954 --> 29:35.255
You are a nasty
creature, aren't you?

29:35.357 --> 29:37.425
But in time,
I’ll beat it out of you.

29:40.629 --> 29:41.929
Reckon that's your date, honey child.

29:41.996 --> 29:43.596
I know why you're going to the ball.

29:43.664 --> 29:46.165
I also know that Sheila Lane is
chairwoman of the entertainment committee

29:46.233 --> 29:47.667
And hasn't missed one of
these affairs in 5 years,

29:47.768 --> 29:49.235
And she might show up.

29:49.303 --> 29:51.371
So you see, I’m going for
the same reason you are.

29:51.439 --> 29:53.807
I'm going because I’m
charitably inclined.

29:53.874 --> 29:54.907
If that's your mood,
go with me.

29:54.975 --> 29:56.909
I'll let you pay
the cab fare.

29:56.977 --> 29:59.679
Hello, Harold. I'll
be ready in a moment.

30:12.359 --> 30:13.959
Very glad to have
met you, Harold.

30:14.026 --> 30:16.161
Drop in again sometime. We'll
have another heart-to-heart talk.

30:30.276 --> 30:32.377
I never thought
I’d live to see the day

30:32.444 --> 30:33.745
You'd turn your back
on the middle classes.

30:33.812 --> 30:35.045
How do you like it?

30:35.146 --> 30:36.280
On the expense
account,

30:36.348 --> 30:37.948
They call it
a disguise.

30:38.016 --> 30:40.451
This is the last place in the world
I ever thought I’d run into a cop.

30:40.519 --> 30:42.953
When I get the time, I’m
gonna resent that crack.

30:43.021 --> 30:45.423
Why don't you quit leading this
double life? Go home to your wife.

30:45.491 --> 30:48.526
You know why I’m here,
and I know why you're here.

30:48.594 --> 30:51.061
there's no ulterior
motives in my charitable impulses.

30:51.129 --> 30:54.164
yeah? I'd like
to grab Sheila Lane, too.

30:54.232 --> 30:56.232
Hey, boss, I found
out about that-

30:56.300 --> 30:57.534
He's ok.

30:57.602 --> 30:58.835
That was a tough job,
but I dug it up.

30:58.903 --> 31:01.137
Covered every
insurance company.

31:01.205 --> 31:05.642
George Lane left an
insurance policy of $250,000.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.811
Hey, very clever
fellow.

31:07.879 --> 31:09.813
why didn't
you come to me?

31:09.881 --> 31:10.847
I could have
saved you the job.

31:10.915 --> 31:12.582
We knew that
all the time.

31:12.650 --> 31:15.485
It's possible a wife would kill her
husband for that amount of money.

31:15.586 --> 31:17.954
You might even call it
justifiable homicide.

31:18.022 --> 31:20.289
But, Peter, the wife
isn't the beneficiary.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.525
It's his partner
Thomas.

31:25.995 --> 31:27.563
Thanks a lot, Jim. I'll
see you in the office.

31:46.515 --> 31:48.149
It don't make
sense to me.

31:48.216 --> 31:49.717
Thomas has got $10 million in the bank.

31:49.785 --> 31:51.986
Why would he kill his
partner for 250,000?

31:52.054 --> 31:54.021
What makes you so sure he's
got 10 million in the bank?

31:54.089 --> 31:56.357
That guy's as solid
as the bank of England.

31:56.425 --> 31:58.059
He's got relatives all
through the banking business.

31:58.126 --> 32:00.662
Why don't you subpoena
his books and find out?

32:00.729 --> 32:02.897
Ain't I got enough trouble with
Manton trying to get my badge?

32:02.965 --> 32:05.500
Do I have to get wall
street on my neck, too?

32:07.502 --> 32:08.936
Any sign
of Sheila Lane yet?

32:09.003 --> 32:12.172
No. Gee, how I wish I could
get my hands on that dame.

32:12.239 --> 32:13.574
And you a married
man, lieutenant.

32:13.675 --> 32:14.575
Tsk tsk tsk.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.963
Did you kill
George Lane?

32:37.030 --> 32:38.731
What reason would I
have to kill him?

32:38.832 --> 32:42.067
250,000 reasons.

32:42.135 --> 32:43.268
So you knew
about that policy.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.370
Yes.

32:44.437 --> 32:45.872
And you knew
I was going broke.

32:45.939 --> 32:49.642
Stop it, Fred. I know too
much to associate with you.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.878
Let's call it quits.

32:51.945 --> 32:53.813
You don't credit me with
much intelligence, do you?

32:53.881 --> 32:55.647
What do you mean?

32:55.715 --> 32:57.716
That I know you've been carrying
on with George Lane for months.

32:57.783 --> 32:59.217
That's a lie.

32:59.284 --> 33:00.986
And that you'll find it
very difficult to explain

33:01.053 --> 33:03.421
Where you were the night
George Lane was murdered.

33:06.759 --> 33:07.759
Helen.

33:10.029 --> 33:11.596
Come on. We've got
work to do.

33:11.664 --> 33:12.831
I've got a date.

33:26.011 --> 33:27.711
Give me
the crowbar.

33:28.947 --> 33:30.681
Shh.

33:35.654 --> 33:37.421
Give me the tools.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.860
Shh.

34:06.817 --> 34:08.951
If we get caught, how
will we explain this?

34:09.018 --> 34:10.119
We're only doing
the same kind of work

34:10.187 --> 34:12.688
They do here
during the day.

34:37.246 --> 34:38.179
Shh.

34:38.246 --> 34:39.280
Shh!

34:39.348 --> 34:41.047
shh!

34:47.989 --> 34:49.257
Echo.

35:01.603 --> 35:03.070
Thanks, Helen.

35:03.138 --> 35:03.671
What for?

35:13.949 --> 35:15.282
Helen...

35:17.152 --> 35:19.385
I...

35:19.453 --> 35:21.454
I don't think we're alone.

35:21.522 --> 35:22.388
Oh!

35:26.994 --> 35:29.495
Well, dopey. When did you get in here?

35:29.563 --> 35:31.998
I was here when
you gently stole in.

35:32.066 --> 35:33.299
By the way, there's
nothing in the drawer.

35:33.367 --> 35:35.468
I, for one, am glad you're here.

35:35.536 --> 35:37.170
Mrs. Benedict Arnold.

35:37.237 --> 35:39.205
come here,
Joe.

35:39.273 --> 35:41.307
I brought up an expert in
safes. I want you to meet-

35:41.375 --> 35:44.043
Uh-Uh. No names, boss.
No names.

35:44.110 --> 35:45.277
Are you
a real crook?

35:45.344 --> 35:46.979
The last lawyer
what defended me

35:47.047 --> 35:49.148
Said I was
antisocial.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.816
I kind of like that better
than crook. Don't you?

35:50.884 --> 35:52.651
Come on, Mr. X.
Let's get to work.

35:52.719 --> 35:54.586
No. Not before
witnesses.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.388
She's all right. That's
the girl I’m going to marry.

35:56.455 --> 35:59.158
You know, a wife can't
testify against her husband.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.859
Yeah, but she could testify against me.

36:00.927 --> 36:04.396
I could marry you. As a
matter of fact, I’d prefer it.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.831
Oh, it looked to me like
she was gonna marry you.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.001
Oh, I was only
fooling.

36:10.069 --> 36:12.003
Of course I’m
going to marry him.

36:12.071 --> 36:13.404
Yeah, but how about
this other dame?

36:13.471 --> 36:15.206
I'm going to be
his second wife.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.742
I'm raising the ante
50 bucks.

36:17.810 --> 36:19.376
Okey-doke.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.752
There she is.

36:27.820 --> 36:31.922
All right, Mr. X, get your
photostatic machine ready.

36:31.989 --> 36:33.389
This may take a little time, girls.

36:33.457 --> 36:36.793
That's all right. We'll start
planning Melsa's trousseau.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.561
Lay off the salmon.
I hate it.

36:52.476 --> 36:55.677
Here's a certified
profit and loss statement.

36:55.746 --> 36:58.080
My hunch was right.
Thomas is in a bad way.

36:58.148 --> 36:59.915
I just can't believe
he did it.

36:59.983 --> 37:02.351
You know, I like
loyalty in a woman.

37:02.418 --> 37:04.286
And hate deceit.
Get me that envelope.

37:04.354 --> 37:05.487
It's marked
personal.

37:05.555 --> 37:06.521
It's none of your business.

37:06.589 --> 37:08.090
Anyhow, this is
Lane's paper,

37:08.158 --> 37:09.892
And you're investigating Thomas.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.293
Give it to me.
Go away.

37:11.361 --> 37:13.528
Go away.
You bother me.

37:15.132 --> 37:18.367
Here's 1,000 withdrawn on
the 8th. 1,000, the 15th.

37:18.434 --> 37:21.335
On the 22nd.
Looks like 1,000 every week.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.571
Here's 20,000 withdrawn
the day Lane was murdered.

37:23.639 --> 37:25.740
Mr. X, what does that
smell like to you?

37:25.808 --> 37:26.808
Blackmail.

37:26.876 --> 37:28.276
Mmm. Very interesting.

37:28.343 --> 37:31.512
Maybe this is what
cost him the 20 grand

37:31.613 --> 37:33.281
And that thousand
every week in blackmail.

37:33.348 --> 37:35.750
Sheila was married to a convict
named Norris before she married Lane.

37:35.818 --> 37:38.352
He's doing a 10-Year
stretch right now.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.687
Here are the clippings
on him.

37:42.124 --> 37:44.557
oh.

37:44.625 --> 37:46.894
So Sheila was married to number 3572.

37:46.961 --> 37:48.862
am I being paged?

37:50.799 --> 37:53.100
Hello, Eddie. Thought
you were in jail.

37:53.168 --> 37:55.869
Got out a week ago. They
knocked off a couple of years

37:55.937 --> 37:57.337
Because I was a good boy.

37:57.405 --> 37:58.806
Look here, Eddie. I had
nothing to do with this.

37:58.873 --> 37:59.940
I'm just up here
on a job.

38:00.008 --> 38:01.441
I got 100 smackers
for it.

38:01.509 --> 38:04.878
Shut up, rat. Put those
papers back in the envelope.

38:04.946 --> 38:07.280
You know, Norris,
you've just done a stretch.

38:07.348 --> 38:09.081
If they nab you
with that water pistol,

38:09.149 --> 38:11.584
You're going to catch
an awful spanking.

38:11.652 --> 38:13.052
toss it over.

38:14.789 --> 38:16.155
Stand there
and toss it over.

38:16.256 --> 38:17.123
All right.

38:29.837 --> 38:31.303
Thanks.

38:31.371 --> 38:32.771
Cost you another
50 bucks.

38:32.839 --> 38:34.640
She's dead.
She's dead! He shot her!

38:34.708 --> 38:36.575
Melsa, speak to me!

38:36.643 --> 38:38.644
get some water.

38:40.647 --> 38:44.783
Melsa. Oh, Melsa, darling,
please, please don't be dead.

38:44.884 --> 38:45.784
here it is.

38:49.088 --> 38:51.022
It's all right.
It's distilled water.

38:51.090 --> 38:54.059
What do you mean by
calling me "darling"?

38:59.965 --> 39:02.166
Are you sure there's no
hole there? It feels empty.

39:02.234 --> 39:04.235
It don't only feel empty, it is empty.

39:04.302 --> 39:05.703
If it weren't, you
wouldn't be messing around

39:05.771 --> 39:06.738
In things like this.

39:06.805 --> 39:08.339
Oh, Hilda,
you're fired.

39:08.407 --> 39:11.376
Please pack your bags and go
and leave me to die here alone.

39:11.443 --> 39:13.110
Oh, my poor head.

39:13.178 --> 39:14.545
Hilda? Hilda!

39:14.613 --> 39:16.848
Oh, there's that
mob again.

39:16.915 --> 39:18.782
Melsa, darling,
how are you?

39:24.222 --> 39:26.523
oh, girls,
please, my head!

39:26.591 --> 39:28.859
Why didn't you take us along
last night? We missed all the fun.

39:28.927 --> 39:30.327
What's funny about
a bump on my head?

39:30.395 --> 39:31.862
I think
it's beautiful.

39:31.930 --> 39:33.163
Getting wounded
in the line of duty.

39:33.231 --> 39:34.865
Imagine,
capturing a murderer.

39:34.933 --> 39:36.566
Well, he claims
an alibi.

39:36.634 --> 39:37.868
"Edward Norris,
held on suspicion

39:37.936 --> 39:39.636
"Of the murders of
George Lane, Ronny Beldon,

39:39.704 --> 39:41.705
"And Sheila Lane, whose
body has not yet been found,

39:41.773 --> 39:44.040
"Claims an alibi-
Declares he was

39:44.108 --> 39:46.142
"With girlfriend Frances
Glesk at hockey match

39:46.210 --> 39:47.710
"At time of George
Lane's murder.

39:47.778 --> 39:50.079
"So far, attempts of
police to locate miss Glesk

39:50.147 --> 39:51.680
Have proved
fruitless. "

39:51.748 --> 39:55.018
The police-All they know is to
blow a whistle and tie up traffic.

39:55.085 --> 39:56.519
y'all can't
come in here.

39:56.586 --> 39:58.388
oh, yes, I can!
Get out of my way!

39:58.455 --> 40:01.490
It's all your fault.

40:01.558 --> 40:03.326
If you hadn't been there,
he wouldn't have been nabbed.

40:03.394 --> 40:04.727
And all he wanted
was the papers.

40:04.795 --> 40:06.328
Now they've tied him
up with the killing.

40:06.396 --> 40:07.896
Sheila Lane doesn't
mean a thing to him.

40:07.964 --> 40:10.565
Sure, he was married
to her, but he loves me!

40:10.633 --> 40:12.434
He loves me!

40:14.237 --> 40:15.670
Gee, how he must
love her.

40:21.311 --> 40:22.978
What did I do?
Pass out?

40:23.046 --> 40:26.448
You're Frances Glesk,
aren't you?

40:26.515 --> 40:29.751
Yes, and I’m risking
everything coming here to you,

40:29.819 --> 40:31.185
But you got Eddie
into this mess,

40:31.253 --> 40:33.354
And you're responsible
for what happens to him.

40:33.422 --> 40:34.956
You've got to help me
clear him.

40:35.023 --> 40:36.357
You're Eddie Norris'
alibi.

40:36.425 --> 40:37.358
If you were with him
at the hockey game,

40:37.426 --> 40:38.625
Why don't you go
to the police?

40:38.693 --> 40:42.463
I can't go to the police.
I'm a two-Time loser now.

40:42.530 --> 40:44.398
In order to do Eddie
any good, I’d have to lie,

40:44.466 --> 40:47.201
And if they catch me,
it means a life stretch.

40:47.269 --> 40:49.103
You're an unselfish
sort of gal, aren't you?

40:49.204 --> 40:50.271
What do you mean,
you'd have to lie?

40:50.339 --> 40:52.673
The only kind of an alibi
I could give Eddie

40:52.740 --> 40:54.240
Would send him
to the chair.

40:54.308 --> 40:55.875
He left me during the
10-minute intermission

40:55.943 --> 40:56.977
For a smoke.

40:57.044 --> 40:59.612
The cops would jump
on that, and they'd-

40:59.680 --> 41:01.448
Wait a minute.

41:01.515 --> 41:02.615
That intermission wouldn't give him time

41:02.683 --> 41:04.217
To cross town
and get back.

41:04.285 --> 41:07.287
I know the police. They'd railroad
him on less evidence than that.

41:07.355 --> 41:08.855
Isn't that
the usual claim?

41:08.922 --> 41:10.923
Look here, you.
I'm telling the truth.

41:10.992 --> 41:13.759
You've got to believe me. Eddie
didn't do it. He isn't that kind.

41:13.827 --> 41:15.761
I suppose those two guns he
pointed at us in Lane's office

41:15.829 --> 41:17.030
Were paper-Mache.

41:17.098 --> 41:19.098
You didn't happen to
know George Lane, did you?

41:19.165 --> 41:21.400
Only slightly.

41:21.468 --> 41:22.901
What are you
driving at?

41:22.969 --> 41:25.170
Her alibi for Norris is also
a perfect alibi for herself.

41:25.238 --> 41:27.139
Don't be silly. We all knew George Lane,

41:27.207 --> 41:28.940
But none of us
killed him.

41:29.009 --> 41:30.675
I believe you,
and we're going to help you.

41:30.743 --> 41:32.311
Come on, girls.
We've got work to do.

41:32.379 --> 41:33.612
hello, Hilda.
Is Miss Manton in?

41:33.679 --> 41:35.414
no, sir. She done
left for South America.

41:35.482 --> 41:37.116
Hello, girls.
Came up to celebrate.

41:37.183 --> 41:39.218
Got a $25 raise.

41:39.285 --> 41:41.120
He offered me the money or
new furniture in the office.

41:41.187 --> 41:42.186
I took the money.

41:42.254 --> 41:43.154
A raise? For what?

41:43.222 --> 41:44.822
Catching a murderer.

41:44.890 --> 41:46.657
Wasn't that a little
premature of your employers?

41:46.725 --> 41:48.326
Norris hasn't been
indicted yet.

41:48.394 --> 41:49.827
He's unquestionably
guilty.

41:49.895 --> 41:51.662
He goes before the grand
jury in the morning.

41:51.730 --> 41:53.231
Why, you-

41:53.298 --> 41:56.401
This is Dora’s cousin Ann
Spaulding from Chattanooga.

41:56.468 --> 41:57.868
How do you do?
Welcome to the game.

41:57.936 --> 41:59.237
Where did you say
you were from?

41:59.304 --> 42:00.338
Chattanooga.

42:00.406 --> 42:01.906
Get the exact
address.

42:01.973 --> 42:03.774
We'll send her an
invitation to our marriage.

42:03.842 --> 42:05.376
What marriage?

42:05.444 --> 42:07.477
Now, don't try
to crawl out of it.

42:07.545 --> 42:09.913
Helen witnessed your promise
last night, didn't you, Helen?

42:09.980 --> 42:12.416
Congratulations, Peter.
May I be the first?

42:12.483 --> 42:14.418
If I want to marry
a fortune hunter,

42:14.485 --> 42:16.553
I can go to Europe and
marry a professional one.

42:16.620 --> 42:17.820
I'm determined
to make you happy

42:17.888 --> 42:19.423
If I have to drag
your name

42:19.490 --> 42:21.024
Through the breach-of-promise
courts to do it.

42:21.092 --> 42:23.293
You're from Chattanooga, where
they have a higher sense of values.

42:23.361 --> 42:24.594
Don't you think
I’m a good catch?

42:24.662 --> 42:27.230
Well, um, uh,
I wouldn't know.

42:27.298 --> 42:28.731
You must know
the Carlisles.

42:28.799 --> 42:30.599
Very old family, mint
julep and all that?

42:30.667 --> 42:32.134
You know the Carlisles.

42:32.235 --> 42:33.302
Oh, yes.

42:33.370 --> 42:35.171
Yes. Ha ha!

42:35.238 --> 42:36.905
I must develop a taste
for this stuff.

42:36.973 --> 42:38.340
Since we're
being married

42:38.408 --> 42:40.742
And you've got plenty of
money, we can afford it.

42:40.810 --> 42:41.777
A drink, miss Spaulding?

42:41.844 --> 42:43.845
No. She never touches
the stuff.

42:43.913 --> 42:45.981
Thanks awfully
for dropping in.

42:46.049 --> 42:47.116
Wait a minute.

42:47.184 --> 42:48.284
I'll show you
to the elevator.

42:48.351 --> 42:49.918
Hello, everybody.

42:49.986 --> 42:50.819
Where have you been? Melsa and
I have been getting engaged,

42:50.887 --> 42:51.787
And you weren't here.

42:51.854 --> 42:53.389
Engaged?

42:53.457 --> 42:54.655
I liked your cousin, even if
she won't hoist a mug with us.

42:54.723 --> 42:56.091
My cousin?

42:56.158 --> 42:57.658
Yes, you know
- From Chattanooga. She just got in.

42:57.726 --> 42:59.461
You are surprised to see
here, aren't you, darling?

42:59.528 --> 43:02.063
honey,
how are you?

43:02.131 --> 43:03.264
good-Bye now.

43:03.332 --> 43:04.632
Good-Bye.

43:04.700 --> 43:05.766
Oh. Oh!

43:05.834 --> 43:07.435
Could I use your phone? Thanks.

43:07.503 --> 43:08.403
Oh, dear.

43:16.178 --> 43:18.378
Hello?

43:18.446 --> 43:20.514
Lieutenant Brent.

43:22.317 --> 43:24.384
If I were you, I’d use a
little more discrimination

43:24.452 --> 43:25.952
In the choice
of my relatives.

43:28.089 --> 43:32.192
Hello, Mike? There's somebody up here
I think you're very anxious to meet.

43:32.260 --> 43:35.662
Hello? Hello?

43:35.730 --> 43:38.365
get him, girls.

43:38.433 --> 43:41.001
hey, wait
a minute, girls.

43:41.068 --> 43:43.569
Take it easy, girls.
Look. Hello? Help!

43:43.637 --> 43:45.871
Stop! Don't! Aah!

43:45.939 --> 43:49.609
Hello? Hello, operator.
Operator. Operator.

43:49.676 --> 43:52.445
Hello? Hello, operator.
Operator.

43:57.184 --> 43:58.984
You've got him.

43:59.052 --> 44:00.353
all right,
come on.

44:00.420 --> 44:03.088
Oh, wait a minute.

44:08.327 --> 44:09.628
There.
That'll hold him.

44:09.695 --> 44:10.695
Come on.

44:13.166 --> 44:15.733
And the next time, we'll
give you a black eye.

44:19.605 --> 44:21.239
This isn't play
any longer.

44:21.307 --> 44:22.541
We're dealing
with a man's life.

44:22.608 --> 44:24.643
The rest period in hockey
games is 10 minutes.

44:24.710 --> 44:26.545
It's up to us to prove whether
Norris could or could not

44:26.612 --> 44:29.147
Get up to the Lane house, kill
a man, and get back in that time.

44:29.215 --> 44:31.081
I'm purposely making it
the same time of night

44:31.149 --> 44:33.217
Because we'll be facing
the same traffic problems.

44:33.285 --> 44:36.287
Helen, you take a cab;
Myra, the bus;

44:36.354 --> 44:37.488
Kit, the subway; and, pat,
walk as fast as you can,

44:37.556 --> 44:38.955
But don't stop
at restaurants.

44:39.023 --> 44:41.492
All right,
now start off.

44:53.971 --> 44:55.538
"While, with their usual enthusiasm,

44:55.606 --> 44:57.407
"The police were
browbeating an innocent man,

44:57.474 --> 45:00.643
"Melsa Manton and her group
of public-Spirited friends

45:00.712 --> 45:02.045
"Have unearthed a
witness who substantiated

45:02.113 --> 45:03.680
Ed Norris' alibi. "

45:03.748 --> 45:05.381
We're grateful for the chance
to hammer the police a bit.

45:05.449 --> 45:06.750
You'll keep this off the
streets for 20 minutes,

45:06.818 --> 45:08.118
As you promised?

45:08.186 --> 45:09.753
We're old-Fashioned
enough to keep our word.

45:09.821 --> 45:11.387
I'm going down to the
district attorney's office.

45:11.455 --> 45:12.989
They're going to
indict Norris.

45:13.057 --> 45:16.392
Anytime you want a job
as a reporter, come to me.

45:17.894 --> 45:19.228
I'd like to speak
to the district attorney.

45:19.295 --> 45:20.963
He's busy.

45:21.031 --> 45:22.564
Mr. Ames and Mr. Brent don't
happen to be in there, do they?

45:22.632 --> 45:24.266
I refuse to answer.

45:24.334 --> 45:25.935
I must see the district
attorney immediately.

45:26.002 --> 45:28.104
I'll not be
intimidated!

45:28.171 --> 45:29.605
Please sit over there
and wait your turn.

45:30.807 --> 45:31.907
Yes, sir.

45:31.975 --> 45:33.042
bring in
that police report.

45:33.110 --> 45:34.744
Yes, sir.

45:37.914 --> 45:40.216
Norris, we're going before
the grand jury in a few minutes.

45:40.283 --> 45:42.250
Why don't you
write out a confession?

45:42.317 --> 45:44.552
You threatened to kill
anyone that mistreated Sheila.

45:44.620 --> 45:46.587
Now, look, Norris,
I’m your pal.

45:46.655 --> 45:48.890
Play ball with us, and I’ll
get you off with second degree.

45:48.958 --> 45:51.425
Go away before I smack you
in your stomach trouble.

45:51.493 --> 45:53.594
I must see the district
attorney at once.

45:53.662 --> 45:55.296
Indeed? Well, young lady,

45:55.364 --> 45:57.431
The rule of this office
is that you wait your turn.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.500
Yes?

45:59.568 --> 46:00.501
what's that?

46:00.569 --> 46:02.370
Oh, I beg your pardon.

46:02.437 --> 46:03.371
Bring in that file
on Norris.

46:03.438 --> 46:04.405
Yes, sir.

46:25.894 --> 46:28.095
why should I
kill anyone?

46:28.196 --> 46:30.429
I've got a good job now,
foreman on the new subway.

46:30.497 --> 46:32.265
I said I was going
straight, and I am.

46:32.332 --> 46:34.200
Norris, you were
known to have hated Lane.

46:34.268 --> 46:36.235
You were willing to murder me
and several lovely young girls

46:36.303 --> 46:37.804
To destroy evidence.

46:37.871 --> 46:39.872
Whoa! Whoo!

46:39.940 --> 46:41.473
What is this, anyway?

46:41.541 --> 46:42.574
I didn't do anything.

46:42.642 --> 46:43.910
Where did you
get this?

46:43.977 --> 46:46.145
Sir, I don't know, except
maybe that young lady-

46:46.213 --> 46:47.379
Oh, it's you.

46:47.447 --> 46:49.315
See here,
young lady,

46:49.382 --> 46:50.382
You can't do this sort
of thing in my office.

46:50.450 --> 46:52.084
Here are the affidavits-
The legal proof

46:52.152 --> 46:53.285
That the law of physics
is maintained.

46:53.385 --> 46:54.853
One object cannot be
in two places at the same time.

46:54.921 --> 46:56.054
Another paper
prints it,

46:56.122 --> 46:57.355
It might cost me
my job.

46:57.423 --> 46:58.857
That's all right, darling.

46:58.925 --> 47:00.692
I'll use my influence
and get you on the W.P.A.

47:00.759 --> 47:03.428
Miss Manton, all the police ask
is that you leave them alone.

47:03.495 --> 47:04.762
I suppose I should have
left you alone.

47:04.831 --> 47:06.264
You had a very lovely
suspect,

47:06.332 --> 47:07.765
And you probably
could have proven,

47:07.834 --> 47:10.101
In your inimitable way,
that he did it.

47:10.169 --> 47:12.370
The fact that he was innocent
would never disturb your sleep.

47:12.438 --> 47:15.606
A man would die for it, and
the real murderer would go free.

47:15.674 --> 47:17.875
As long as inspector
Brent kept his badge.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.511
Isn't she wonderful?

47:21.579 --> 47:22.947
That's the girl
I’m gonna marry.

47:23.014 --> 47:24.381
I'll take snow white.

47:24.449 --> 47:25.782
My advice to you
is to find Sheila Lane

47:25.851 --> 47:27.918
And to keep that Manton
girl out of your affairs.

47:27.986 --> 47:30.087
She's probably
the kind of a dame

47:30.155 --> 47:31.355
That would come back
to haunt me.

47:31.422 --> 47:32.723
Otherwise I’d
shoot to kill.

47:34.292 --> 47:35.559
Hello, girls.

47:35.626 --> 47:37.261
Myra, it's about time
you got here.

47:37.329 --> 47:38.395
I wasn't in when your message
came. What did you want?

47:38.463 --> 47:40.064
We're looking
for Sheila Lane.

47:40.131 --> 47:41.498
I don't believe
she's been murdered.

47:41.566 --> 47:42.532
I think she's hiding
from the police,

47:42.600 --> 47:43.967
Afraid because
she knows too much.

47:44.034 --> 47:46.236
Now, of what was
Sheila Lane the proudest?

47:46.303 --> 47:47.571
Her marriage license.

47:47.638 --> 47:48.638
She should have been,
but she wasn't.

47:48.706 --> 47:50.306
Her red hair,
darling.

47:50.375 --> 47:52.342
She was proudest of her flaming topper.

47:52.410 --> 47:53.943
She used the same
beauty shop I do.

47:54.011 --> 47:56.246
I found out her hairdresser
rinsed her hair

47:56.313 --> 47:58.382
In an imported preparation
very few shops use.

47:58.449 --> 47:59.750
If that peacock
is still alive,

47:59.817 --> 48:01.518
She's getting
the stuff somewhere.

48:01.586 --> 48:02.819
This time, it's find
the hair preparation,

48:02.887 --> 48:04.553
And you'll find the woman.

48:04.621 --> 48:07.823
I'm getting so scared, I’m beginning
to see faces over my shoulder.

48:07.891 --> 48:09.859
If any of you girls feel
like pulling out, go ahead.

48:09.926 --> 48:11.527
Melsa, don't feel
that way about it.

48:11.595 --> 48:12.661
I hate
the color yellow.

48:12.729 --> 48:13.929
There's no disgrace
in being frightened.

48:13.997 --> 48:15.531
Oh, we'll stick.

48:15.599 --> 48:17.867
All you children run along
now and get some sleep.

48:17.934 --> 48:19.468
You go on and get
your shower, honey child.

48:19.536 --> 48:22.104
Myra, you take all the beauty
shops along 8th and 9th avenue,

48:22.171 --> 48:24.006
From 42nd to 59th street.

48:24.073 --> 48:25.974
The rest of you girls
know your routes.

48:26.042 --> 48:27.643
Melsa certainly wants
her pound of flesh.

48:27.711 --> 48:30.077
Are you sure she doesn't
want 150 pounds of it?

48:30.145 --> 48:31.780
Quiet, you carrion.

48:31.847 --> 48:35.884
Girls, girls. All they
think about nowadays is men.

48:38.754 --> 48:40.889
And then again, why not?

48:40.956 --> 48:42.857
They make
awful good thinking.

48:47.229 --> 48:48.797
Who there
this time of night?

48:48.864 --> 48:50.097
I want to talk
to Melsa Manton.

48:50.165 --> 48:52.133
You can't talk
to her now.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.334
Why not? Because
she's all wet.

48:54.402 --> 48:55.769
She's in the shower.

48:55.837 --> 48:57.738
Tell her she'd better not
try to find Sheila Lane,

48:57.806 --> 48:59.239
Or she'll wake up
one morning

48:59.307 --> 49:00.407
On the bottom
of the east river.

49:00.475 --> 49:03.710
Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
I hear you.

49:03.778 --> 49:05.679
No, sir, I ain't
arguing with you.

49:05.747 --> 49:07.213
Good-Bye, sir, please.

49:12.821 --> 49:15.221
G- Get me
the morning clarion.

49:15.289 --> 49:17.924
"Number, please?" I don't know
no number except policy numbers.

49:17.991 --> 49:20.025
You give me
the morning clarion.

49:20.093 --> 49:21.561
You're being paid
to edit.

49:21.628 --> 49:23.162
Your place is
behind this desk.

49:23.229 --> 49:24.730
You'll get
your money's worth.

49:24.798 --> 49:27.433
My place is behind this desk,
and behind this desk I stay.

49:27.501 --> 49:30.402
Yes?

49:30.471 --> 49:32.939
Yes, Hilda.

49:33.006 --> 49:35.708
What? What?

49:35.776 --> 49:37.777
I'll be right over.

49:37.845 --> 49:39.745
Get lieutenant Brent
at headquarters.

49:39.813 --> 49:41.245
Tell him to get over to Melsa
Manton's apartment right away.

49:41.313 --> 49:42.647
I'll tell him why later.

49:42.715 --> 49:43.615
Yes, but you just said-

49:49.388 --> 49:52.156
Melsa. Melsa, my darling,
what have they done-

49:52.224 --> 49:53.558
Hilda! Hilda!

49:53.626 --> 49:55.293
Oh, it's you.

49:55.361 --> 49:56.227
Darling,
you're not dead.

49:56.295 --> 49:57.362
Are you disappointed?

49:57.429 --> 49:58.797
You gave me the fright of my life.

49:58.865 --> 49:59.764
Do you always
sleep this way?

49:59.832 --> 50:00.799
Yes.

50:00.867 --> 50:02.066
Something will have
to be done about it.

50:02.134 --> 50:03.668
I can't stand a fright
like this every night.

50:03.736 --> 50:06.203
I assume you had a very good
reason for bursting in this way,

50:06.270 --> 50:07.437
Or is it spring?

50:07.506 --> 50:09.039
That threat. That threat over the phone.

50:09.107 --> 50:10.608
I'm spending the night right here.

50:10.709 --> 50:14.945
In my lifetime, I’ve heard
of a variety of subterfuges,

50:15.013 --> 50:16.580
But, Ames,
you are superb.

50:16.648 --> 50:18.248
No other man
in the whole world

50:18.316 --> 50:19.984
Could have thought
of this.

50:20.051 --> 50:21.685
You're up to your
beautiful hips in murder.

50:21.753 --> 50:23.521
You're fooling around with
someone who isn't afraid to kill.

50:23.588 --> 50:26.189
Who is he? What are
you girls up to?

50:26.257 --> 50:28.258
Wouldn't you and Brent
love to know?

50:28.326 --> 50:30.960
Remember I once said I’d beat
that nastiness out of you?

50:31.029 --> 50:32.262
You want me
to start now?

50:32.330 --> 50:33.263
I'd better go.

50:33.331 --> 50:34.398
Hilda, you stay here.

50:34.465 --> 50:35.598
I'm not moving
till the police get here.

50:35.666 --> 50:38.768
That man said not to
bring in the police.

50:38.836 --> 50:40.670
Oh, all right. You can
stay in the living room.

50:40.738 --> 50:42.105
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

50:42.173 --> 50:44.307
Oh, Hilda
can sleep in here.

50:44.375 --> 50:45.475
All right, Hilda.
Can you handle a gun?

50:45.543 --> 50:47.444
No, sir.
I's a pacifist.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.711
You see?

50:51.449 --> 50:52.814
You want the lights
on or off?

50:52.882 --> 50:55.384
It doesn't make
any difference to me.

50:55.452 --> 50:57.853
Good night.

51:01.958 --> 51:02.991
May I have
a cigarette?

51:11.368 --> 51:13.969
I've had dozens of cigarette
lighters, but they never work.

51:17.506 --> 51:18.906
I use
cheap gasoline.

51:18.974 --> 51:20.542
Maybe that's why
it works.

51:20.609 --> 51:22.544
I guess so.

51:30.286 --> 51:32.720
Funny thing
about streetlights-

51:32.788 --> 51:34.689
You never notice them.

51:34.756 --> 51:37.658
They're so bright-
Constant, too.

51:37.726 --> 51:39.194
They were on last night
and tonight.

51:39.261 --> 51:40.461
Tomorrow they'll
be there again.

51:40.528 --> 51:43.263
Yes, I suppose the city
is in a rut.

51:43.331 --> 51:45.566
I once smashed
a streetlight.

51:45.633 --> 51:48.602
It was for a lady.
She asked me to do it.

51:48.669 --> 51:51.105
I was 5 then,
very much in love.

51:51.172 --> 51:52.139
Was she pretty?

51:52.207 --> 51:53.707
The cutest thing
you ever saw.

51:53.774 --> 51:55.109
My parents thought
we were too young

51:55.176 --> 51:56.343
To be thinking of that
sort of thing,

51:56.411 --> 51:59.179
And they shipped her off
to kindergarten.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.582
Whatever became of her?

52:01.649 --> 52:04.317
She's probably still in kindergarten.

52:06.587 --> 52:08.421
I couldn't live
in this apartment.

52:08.489 --> 52:09.888
It's too high up
for me.

52:09.956 --> 52:13.292
I've got acrophobia, you
know - fear of high places.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.462
oh.
You sort of...

52:16.530 --> 52:18.464
You sort of get
sick inside?

52:18.532 --> 52:22.135
Yeah, like I’d suddenly
gone empty.

52:22.202 --> 52:26.705
Me, too. That's why I
never go out on the balcony.

52:26.773 --> 52:30.609
I get that way
riding in an elevator.

52:30.676 --> 52:32.410
Up or down?

52:32.478 --> 52:34.346
Up.

52:34.413 --> 52:36.848
I feel like that
both ways.

52:36.915 --> 52:38.850
We have a lot
in common.

52:38.917 --> 52:43.421
Mmm. All except
the elevator.

52:45.958 --> 52:49.027
Melsa. Melsa.

52:49.094 --> 52:50.495
Yes?

52:50.563 --> 52:51.963
Melsa?

52:52.031 --> 52:53.264
What?

52:53.331 --> 52:54.965
I'm terribly worried
about you.

52:55.033 --> 52:56.534
Please tell me who this man
is who's threatening you.

52:56.601 --> 52:58.202
Who is he?

53:00.038 --> 53:01.172
Good night,
Mr. Ames.

53:01.239 --> 53:03.974
I swear, I’m only
concerned about you.

53:06.844 --> 53:08.045
Good night,
Mr. Ames.

53:08.112 --> 53:11.014
Oh, no. I'm not going,
not until-

53:16.287 --> 53:17.520
Hello?

53:17.588 --> 53:19.855
Melsa, I’ve found
Sheila Lane.

53:19.923 --> 53:22.659
A small beauty parlor
on a side street.

53:22.726 --> 53:24.126
The hairdresser didn't
want to talk at first,

53:24.195 --> 53:27.163
But a $100 bill
soon loosened her tongue.

53:27.231 --> 53:29.832
She described Sheila
and said she was staying

53:29.900 --> 53:32.569
At the Hotel Ashton
on 23rd street

53:32.636 --> 53:35.205
And that she called
herself Sharon Lester.

53:39.276 --> 53:42.877
Well,
what's the matter?

53:42.945 --> 53:45.847
Oh, is somebody
there with you?

53:45.915 --> 53:46.881
Oh, well, look.

53:46.949 --> 53:48.183
Can you meet me
down on the corner

53:48.251 --> 53:49.751
In about 10 minutes?

53:49.819 --> 53:51.753
Thanks, pat.

53:51.821 --> 53:53.422
You can stay here
if you want to.

53:53.489 --> 53:55.257
I'm going to spend
the night with pat.

53:55.325 --> 53:56.725
She just
invited me.

53:56.792 --> 53:58.260
That was pat
on the phone.

53:58.328 --> 54:00.028
You can't do that. You
can't go out on the street,

54:00.096 --> 54:02.331
Not until Brent
gets here.

54:02.398 --> 54:03.398
At least let me
take you with me.

54:03.466 --> 54:04.632
Pete.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.866
Mike, I’m glad
you're here.

54:14.309 --> 54:15.843
Peter! Peter!

54:17.946 --> 54:18.812
Come on.
Come on.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.114
Let go of me, copper.

54:20.181 --> 54:21.382
Bat Regan!

54:21.450 --> 54:22.416
Well, who did you think
it was, Kris Kringle?

54:22.484 --> 54:23.451
Why'd you do it?

54:23.518 --> 54:24.852
I'm class-conscious, see?

54:24.919 --> 54:26.687
I don't like
society dames.

54:26.755 --> 54:27.855
I sent for the ambulance, chief.

54:27.922 --> 54:29.055
Ames is
bleeding bad.

54:29.123 --> 54:30.357
Hey, chief, look.

54:30.424 --> 54:31.558
Here's what he threw away.

54:34.262 --> 54:35.528
Throwing away
dough, huh?

54:35.596 --> 54:37.897
Sure. The depression's over.
Things are humming again.

54:37.965 --> 54:39.466
You didn't happen to get this from Lane?

54:39.533 --> 54:41.100
Now, before
you start lying,

54:41.168 --> 54:42.669
We got the numbers
from the bank.

54:42.737 --> 54:45.538
He lost it to me over
one of my roulette tables.

54:45.606 --> 54:46.806
There's
nothing lower

54:46.907 --> 54:49.542
Than a dirty, murdering blackmailer.

54:49.610 --> 54:50.943
With my arms being held,
you're pretty tough!

54:51.044 --> 54:52.678
Let him go.

54:52.746 --> 54:53.646
Ooh!

54:55.148 --> 54:57.516
Try to escape, huh?

54:57.584 --> 54:58.817
There you are.
In a day or two,

54:58.885 --> 54:59.985
You'll be as good as new.

55:00.052 --> 55:01.520
Thanks a lot.
Come on. Give.

55:01.588 --> 55:03.722
I'm hungry.
Oh, boy.

55:05.325 --> 55:06.392
All we could
get out of Regan

55:06.459 --> 55:08.026
Was that he got the money
from Lane gambling.

55:08.094 --> 55:09.561
I think
it was blackmail

55:09.663 --> 55:11.397
And when Lane threatened to go
to the police, he killed him.

55:11.464 --> 55:12.864
Beldon saw it,
so he killed Beldon.

55:12.932 --> 55:14.633
Why should he take
a shot at Melsa?

55:14.701 --> 55:16.768
He says he was cleaning
the gun, and it went off.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.303
Cleaning a gun
in a car.

55:18.370 --> 55:19.470
It's Regan’s gun,

55:19.538 --> 55:21.005
And he insists
it's his privilege

55:21.072 --> 55:23.073
To clean it
wherever he likes.

55:23.141 --> 55:25.109
Now, I’m trying
to hold on to Regan,

55:25.177 --> 55:27.278
But they've set
his bail at 50 grand.

55:27.346 --> 55:28.979
Regan will have that up
in 24 hours.

55:29.047 --> 55:30.080
Fine thing.

55:30.148 --> 55:32.216
Now, look, Pete.

55:32.284 --> 55:33.451
That Manton girl knows
something we don't know.

55:33.519 --> 55:35.420
Otherwise, Regan wouldn't
have tried to kill her.

55:35.487 --> 55:36.521
If he don't tell us,

55:36.588 --> 55:37.955
We'll have to get it
out of Manton.

55:38.023 --> 55:39.023
Get something
out of Manton?

55:39.090 --> 55:40.224
Don't make me laugh.

55:40.292 --> 55:41.525
This tastes too good
to choke on.

55:41.592 --> 55:42.926
Pete...

55:42.993 --> 55:44.528
I told her
you were dying.

55:44.629 --> 55:46.296
She's out there
in the corridor

55:46.364 --> 55:47.631
Crying her head off
for you.

55:47.732 --> 55:49.700
She is?

55:49.767 --> 55:51.301
That's worth
dying for.

55:51.369 --> 55:53.370
Well, almost
worth dying for.

55:53.438 --> 55:56.039
Listen. In the condition she's in,

55:56.106 --> 55:58.508
She'd even tell you
her age if you asked her.

55:58.576 --> 55:59.810
You could get
anything out of her

55:59.877 --> 56:01.277
Is she thinks
you're dying.

56:01.346 --> 56:02.679
I’m sorry.
You can't come in, lady.

56:02.747 --> 56:05.815
oh, I must see him.
I must see him!

56:05.882 --> 56:07.015
Let her in, Sullivan.

56:10.119 --> 56:11.620
Don't tax him too much.

56:11.688 --> 56:13.288
He's sinking fast.

56:13.357 --> 56:15.424
Golly.

56:15.492 --> 56:17.159
Oh, darling.

56:19.062 --> 56:20.996
Who... who is it?

56:21.064 --> 56:23.599
It's Melsa.

56:23.667 --> 56:25.968
What have they done
to you, darling?

56:26.035 --> 56:28.003
They... killed me.

56:28.071 --> 56:29.170
the rats.

56:29.238 --> 56:30.839
Oh, no, they haven't.
You'll live.

56:30.906 --> 56:32.240
You've got to live.

56:32.307 --> 56:34.108
You've got to get
strong and well

56:34.176 --> 56:36.444
For your career,
your future.

56:36.545 --> 56:37.746
Future?

56:39.548 --> 56:40.615
Future.

56:40.683 --> 56:43.184
Yes. Your future.
Our future.

56:43.252 --> 56:44.952
You promised
before witnesses

56:45.020 --> 56:47.389
That you'd marry me.

56:47.456 --> 56:48.923
You've got to live!

56:48.991 --> 56:51.993
Oh, I love you.
I love you.

56:52.060 --> 56:53.660
Oww! Ohh!

56:53.795 --> 56:55.496
Ohh...

56:55.563 --> 56:57.431
The first death rattle.

56:57.499 --> 56:59.099
Oh!

56:59.166 --> 57:01.167
Who was it said,

57:01.235 --> 57:04.104
"Joy always
comes to a man

57:04.171 --> 57:05.806
Too late. "

57:05.874 --> 57:08.642
Oh, no. No!
Pete.

57:08.710 --> 57:10.210
Oh!
Pete, boy.

57:10.278 --> 57:12.045
Don't you want us
to avenge you?

57:12.113 --> 57:17.016
No, Mike.
I forgive everybody.

57:17.083 --> 57:19.852
That's what I call
a nice guy.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.422
Even the rat
who shot you?

57:22.489 --> 57:24.957
Even him, Mike.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.492
Wouldn't you...

57:26.560 --> 57:28.828
Wouldn't you rest
just a little bit easier

57:28.896 --> 57:30.563
If you knew
why he did it?

57:30.631 --> 57:32.298
Just out of curiosity?

57:32.365 --> 57:34.099
Oh, what good
will it do?

57:34.167 --> 57:36.936
It's all my fault.
Now it's too late.

57:37.003 --> 57:39.104
Mike,
you know Melsa

57:39.172 --> 57:41.272
Wouldn't hold
anything back

57:41.340 --> 57:43.341
From a dying man.

57:43.409 --> 57:44.676
Mr. Ames,

57:44.744 --> 57:46.845
Isn't there something
I can do for you?

57:46.913 --> 57:49.481
Yes, Sullivan.

57:49.549 --> 57:53.819
Sing my favorite
song for me...

57:53.886 --> 57:56.354
Home On the Range.

57:56.422 --> 57:58.222
Sure.

58:00.460 --> 58:03.995
¶ Oh, give me a home ¶

58:04.063 --> 58:07.297
¶ Where
the buffaloes roam ¶

58:07.365 --> 58:13.236
¶ And the deer
and the antelope play... ¶

58:13.304 --> 58:17.207
Never to see
the sun again.

58:17.275 --> 58:19.443
¶ A discouraging word... ¶

58:19.511 --> 58:20.544
I don't
want to die.

58:20.612 --> 58:22.513
I'm too young
to die!

58:22.581 --> 58:25.082
I want to feel
the rain in my face,

58:25.149 --> 58:27.417
The wind
in my hair.

58:27.486 --> 58:29.552
I want to smell
the good earth.

58:29.620 --> 58:33.255
Oh, Peter! Peter!

58:33.323 --> 58:36.158
We could have made sweet music together.

58:36.226 --> 58:40.296
"He rose like a meteor,
flashed across our sky,

58:40.364 --> 58:43.432
And then was gone. "

58:43.501 --> 58:45.368
Good-bye, Mike.

58:45.435 --> 58:47.436
I'm not gonna
take this lying down.

58:47.505 --> 58:50.306
You're my friend,
my best friend,

58:50.374 --> 58:51.808
And if it's no interest
to Miss Manton,

58:51.876 --> 58:53.041
It is to me.

58:53.109 --> 58:55.210
I must have my revenge!

58:55.277 --> 58:56.512
Why?

58:56.579 --> 58:58.179
Why did Regan take a shot
at you, Miss Manton?

58:58.247 --> 58:59.648
Why?

58:59.716 --> 59:01.783
Oh, we were looking
for Sheila Lane.

59:01.851 --> 59:03.018
He threatened
to kill me

59:03.085 --> 59:04.887
If I didn't stop.

59:04.954 --> 59:09.424
And did you
find her, sweet?

59:09.492 --> 59:10.859
Yes.

59:10.927 --> 59:13.361
She's registered
as Sharon Lester

59:13.429 --> 59:16.731
At the Ashton Hotel
on 23rd street.

59:16.798 --> 59:18.766
Well, I’ll be
seeing you.

59:18.834 --> 59:20.501
I mean...

59:20.569 --> 59:22.403
When my number
is called.

59:24.139 --> 59:25.039
¶ Home on the- ¶

59:25.106 --> 59:25.973
That's enough,
Sullivan.

59:26.041 --> 59:27.041
Quite enough.

59:27.108 --> 59:28.509
¶ Where the deer and- ¶

59:28.577 --> 59:30.077
Where's the phone?

59:30.145 --> 59:31.211
Around the hall.

59:31.312 --> 59:33.480
Down that way.
Ehh!

59:33.549 --> 59:35.482
Oh!

59:39.922 --> 59:41.688
Oh!

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.140
Oh. Oh.

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:05.911
Are you still
in pain, sweet?

01:00:08.548 --> 01:00:10.883
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing.

01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:15.054
Only when I move,
but it's nothing.

01:00:15.121 --> 01:00:17.690
Peter, perhaps
I did wrong

01:00:17.757 --> 01:00:20.960
In not telling inspector
Brent everything.

01:00:21.027 --> 01:00:23.596
You mean you held
something back?

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:25.397
Yes, Peter.

01:00:25.465 --> 01:00:27.866
Oh, sweet,
you're so clever.

01:00:27.934 --> 01:00:30.267
Remember when I went into
Ronny Beldon's apartment?

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:31.803
Yes, dear.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.005
When I went
into the bathroom,

01:00:34.073 --> 01:00:36.007
I found something.

01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:37.141
In the bathroom?

01:00:37.209 --> 01:00:38.643
Yes,

01:00:38.711 --> 01:00:41.713
Floating around in a foot
of water in the bathtub.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.815
Louder, dear.

01:00:43.882 --> 01:00:45.750
I can hardly
hear you.

01:00:47.086 --> 01:00:48.720
I'll come closer.

01:00:48.787 --> 01:00:52.223
Tell me, dear.
What was it?

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:55.425
The Normandy, you black-hearted
faker, in full sail!

01:00:55.493 --> 01:00:57.193
Oww!

01:01:02.266 --> 01:01:04.167
Why did you hide from
the police, Mrs. Lane?

01:01:04.235 --> 01:01:06.169
I didn't hide
from the police.

01:01:06.237 --> 01:01:09.139
I was afraid whoever killed George
and Ronny would kill me, too.

01:01:09.206 --> 01:01:11.508
So I went
to bat Regan.

01:01:11.575 --> 01:01:13.110
I used
to work for him.

01:01:13.177 --> 01:01:15.211
I knew he loved me and
would do anything for me,

01:01:15.279 --> 01:01:16.879
And it was his hotel
I was stopping at.

01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:18.114
He hid me,

01:01:18.181 --> 01:01:19.148
Gave me the money
to live on.

01:01:19.215 --> 01:01:21.550
Your husband's money.
Blackmail money.

01:01:21.618 --> 01:01:23.552
Why did Regan help you
blackmail your husband?

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.821
Oh, please. Please.

01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.757
I told you I went
to the old house

01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:29.825
After my husband
was dead.

01:01:29.893 --> 01:01:31.027
Ronny and I had been
meeting there.

01:01:31.094 --> 01:01:33.095
That's why
you found my clip.

01:01:33.163 --> 01:01:34.530
Ronny saw
my husband murdered,

01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:35.531
But he couldn't
go to the police

01:01:35.598 --> 01:01:37.432
Without exposing
our relationship,

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.934
So he made me leave.

01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:40.835
He must have taken
the body out

01:01:40.903 --> 01:01:42.637
While the Manton girl
was calling the police,

01:01:42.705 --> 01:01:46.307
And then before he could
get rid of it, he-

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:49.077
He was...
he was killed.

01:01:49.145 --> 01:01:50.912
So that's it.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.346
Beldon helped you
murder your husband

01:01:52.414 --> 01:01:54.182
Because he found out
about you two, oh, no.

01:01:54.249 --> 01:01:55.249
And Beldon
loved you enough

01:01:55.317 --> 01:01:56.151
To get rid
of the body for you!

01:01:56.218 --> 01:01:57.451
No!

01:01:57.519 --> 01:01:58.687
Then you murdered Beldon
because he knew too much!

01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:01.489
Oh, lieutenant Brent,

01:02:01.557 --> 01:02:03.857
There isn't very much
left in my life.

01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:07.594
I really don't care
what you do with me.

01:02:07.662 --> 01:02:08.862
Do as you please.

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:10.530
Take her back
to her cell.

01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:14.068
Hello, Miss Manton.
Glad to see you.

01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:15.402
Lieutenant Brent
is waiting for you.

01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:17.504
Go right in.

01:02:17.572 --> 01:02:19.807
Come right in,
Miss Manton.

01:02:19.874 --> 01:02:21.541
Oh, Miss Manton. I've
been waiting for you.

01:02:21.609 --> 01:02:22.876
Won't you be seated?

01:02:24.679 --> 01:02:25.879
Is the chair
comfortable?

01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:26.947
Very. Thank you.

01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:28.014
How about a pillow?

01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:30.517
Oh, no.
Oh, go on. Go on.

01:02:30.585 --> 01:02:31.884
Now, Miss Manton,
as you know,

01:02:31.952 --> 01:02:32.952
You've been
a great help to us.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.087
Oh, yes, you have.

01:02:34.154 --> 01:02:35.589
We may have had our
little disagreements,

01:02:35.656 --> 01:02:36.523
But then,
who doesn't?

01:02:37.491 --> 01:02:39.392
Hello, Mike.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:39.959
Good evening,
inspector.

01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:41.228
Now, Miss Manton,

01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:42.329
Just because you don't like
Ames here, don't allow it

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:43.730
To undermine the good work
you've been doing.

01:02:43.797 --> 01:02:44.664
I didn't know you
were going to be here.

01:02:44.732 --> 01:02:45.765
Brent sent for me.

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:47.701
Now, here's the idea,
Miss Manton.

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:50.036
You saw Ronny Beldon come out
of the Lane house, didn't you?

01:02:50.104 --> 01:02:51.104
Yes.

01:02:51.171 --> 01:02:52.538
Everybody knows
you're mixed up in this.

01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:53.706
Collected evidence.

01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:56.108
Everybody suspects you
holding out. Even I do.

01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:58.810
Oh, I’ll bet you say
that to all the girls.

01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:00.112
Oh.

01:03:00.179 --> 01:03:02.248
Now, what would happen
if we published the fact

01:03:02.315 --> 01:03:04.550
That you had just uncovered
some new evidence

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:05.784
Which is certain to lead

01:03:05.852 --> 01:03:07.185
To the discovery
of the murderer

01:03:07.254 --> 01:03:08.220
And that you
have an appointment

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:09.488
With a district attorney
tomorrow

01:03:09.556 --> 01:03:10.856
To turn over
that evidence to him?

01:03:10.923 --> 01:03:12.791
I'd probably
be found

01:03:12.859 --> 01:03:14.793
In a refrigerator.

01:03:14.861 --> 01:03:15.826
That's right.

01:03:15.894 --> 01:03:16.827
Well,
isn't it lucky

01:03:16.895 --> 01:03:18.596
I didn't find
any new evidence?

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:20.231
Now, all you have to do

01:03:20.299 --> 01:03:21.766
Is appear in public
with Pete here

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.234
Where the murderer
can get at you.

01:03:23.302 --> 01:03:24.736
First, I’ll surround you
with police,

01:03:24.803 --> 01:03:26.137
Then release the suspects.

01:03:26.204 --> 01:03:28.172
Release
the suspects?

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.974
I'm going to Europe
pretty soon.

01:03:30.075 --> 01:03:31.476
I'll be back in the fall,
and then we'll talk it over.

01:03:31.543 --> 01:03:32.577
Now, Miss Manton.

01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:33.578
Mike,
she's right.

01:03:33.646 --> 01:03:34.612
But there's
a killer loose!

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.713
Let me ask you
something, Mike.

01:03:35.781 --> 01:03:36.981
If she was your wife, would you do this?

01:03:37.048 --> 01:03:38.916
Inspector, that's an
implication that I’m his wife.

01:03:39.017 --> 01:03:40.183
I'm not.

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:41.785
Yes, Pete. Because I think
lots of other wives

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.520
Have a right to live
in safety from murderers.

01:03:43.588 --> 01:03:44.788
Now, how about it?
Will you do it?

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.790
No, she won't. I won't
let her be a decoy.

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.158
You won't let me?

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.126
You're scared because he's
asking you to be there, too.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:52.562
This proves there's insanity
in my family. I'll do it.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:53.697
Thanks.

01:03:53.765 --> 01:03:55.332
But don't get the idea
that we're friends.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.100
If I can still take your badge
away from you, I’m going to do it.

01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:00.304
Just catch that killer,
and you can have my badge.

01:04:00.371 --> 01:04:01.605
Release Sheila Lane.

01:04:01.673 --> 01:04:02.673
The rest of them are loose.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.973
Regan got his bail
this morning.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:05.975
Now phone your paper
to print the headline

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:07.811
About Miss Manton
finding new evidence.

01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:13.183
You scared?

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.517
Because I am.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.253
No.

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.289
No, I’m not scared.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.593
Hello. Ames.
Get me rewrite.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.649
extra! Extra!

01:04:50.986 --> 01:04:52.353
Extra! Extra!

01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:15.576
It's all right, boys.

01:05:15.643 --> 01:05:17.010
It was just a car
backfiring.

01:05:17.078 --> 01:05:18.545
Rafferty
from headquarters, miss.

01:05:18.613 --> 01:05:20.113
Don't worry.
We're all around.

01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:26.920
Waiter.

01:05:29.957 --> 01:05:31.258
How's the terrapin
tonight?

01:05:31.325 --> 01:05:34.695
I don't know. I'll ask
the guy in the kitchen.

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:36.530
Never mind.
We'll take the dinner.

01:05:36.598 --> 01:05:37.931
Ok, coming up.

01:05:40.033 --> 01:05:42.134
Do you have
Chablis 29?

01:05:42.202 --> 01:05:43.436
What's Chablis 29?

01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:48.741
What's the idea?

01:05:48.809 --> 01:05:51.310
Hello, Pete.
Excuse me.

01:05:51.378 --> 01:05:53.178
Briscol from headquarters.

01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:55.681
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:56.916
I'll get your chow.

01:05:56.983 --> 01:05:58.117
Wait a minute. Before
you get those dinners,

01:05:58.184 --> 01:05:59.552
Is the chef
from headquarters, too?

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.120
Nah.
Good.

01:06:04.524 --> 01:06:05.557
Dance?

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:06.792
No, thank you.
All right.

01:06:16.569 --> 01:06:19.270
Is it necessary for you
to hold me so tightly?

01:06:19.338 --> 01:06:21.540
Of course, you make a
better target by yourself.

01:06:23.676 --> 01:06:25.410
Why don't you draw
red circles around me

01:06:25.478 --> 01:06:28.145
And rent me out
to a rifle range?

01:06:28.212 --> 01:06:29.413
That wasn't
the real reason

01:06:29.481 --> 01:06:31.816
I was holding you
so close.

01:06:31.883 --> 01:06:33.216
It so happens,

01:06:33.284 --> 01:06:36.253
Heaven help me,
I love you.

01:06:36.321 --> 01:06:38.155
You're taking an unfair
advantage of me.

01:06:38.222 --> 01:06:39.356
The only reason
I’m here with you

01:06:39.424 --> 01:06:41.258
Is because there's
a gun in my back.

01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:42.660
Well, sometimes,
that kind of wedding

01:06:42.727 --> 01:06:45.228
Turns out
very successfully.

01:06:58.108 --> 01:07:00.610
I'm going to become
hysterical in a moment.

01:07:00.678 --> 01:07:03.212
I've got the jitters.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.581
Isn't it awful?

01:07:39.481 --> 01:07:40.548
get going!

01:07:40.616 --> 01:07:41.782
Line them up
and search them!

01:07:41.884 --> 01:07:43.718
Get Pete!
Where's Manton?

01:07:43.785 --> 01:07:44.752
Miss Manton? What
happened to Miss Manton?

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.953
Well, she was right
- Hey, chief.

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:46.988
Whoever it was
got in and out

01:07:47.055 --> 01:07:47.989
Through a window
in the hall.

01:07:48.056 --> 01:07:49.089
I just found
the latch broken.

01:07:49.157 --> 01:07:50.925
He got Melsa. It's your fault, Mike.

01:07:50.993 --> 01:07:52.359
I'm gonna break every bone in your head.

01:07:52.427 --> 01:07:53.661
Did you get him?

01:07:53.729 --> 01:07:55.229
oh, no, Miss Manton. He got away.

01:07:55.296 --> 01:07:56.296
Are you
all right?

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:57.665
Of course. I need a drink.

01:07:57.733 --> 01:07:58.666
I found this stuck
on the windowpane.

01:07:58.734 --> 01:07:59.767
What is it?

01:07:59.835 --> 01:08:00.768
It's a hunk
of tar paper.

01:08:00.836 --> 01:08:02.769
Maybe he's a roofer.

01:08:02.837 --> 01:08:04.104
Maybe you're
a musician.

01:08:04.172 --> 01:08:06.006
22 men,
and all you bring me back

01:08:06.074 --> 01:08:07.774
Is a hunk of tar paper.

01:08:07.842 --> 01:08:09.943
Oh, uh,
I’m an awful mess.

01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:11.145
Would you excuse me
a moment?

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.015
Will you quit
crawling up on me?

01:08:17.285 --> 01:08:18.652
Melsa, let me take you
out of all this.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.254
Wouldn't you rather wait
until I’ve made up?

01:08:20.321 --> 01:08:21.720
Don't be afraid.
I'm gonna stay right here.

01:08:21.822 --> 01:08:22.822
Nobody's going
to pass me.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.558
Isn't that being
a little selfish?

01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:29.828
Hello, Helen? Melsa.

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:31.863
Round up all the girls
and meet me in my apartment.

01:08:31.932 --> 01:08:34.067
Don't ask any questions.
Just meet me.

01:08:34.134 --> 01:08:35.201
All right.

01:10:25.408 --> 01:10:27.508
This subway ain't
open yet, miss.

01:10:27.576 --> 01:10:28.842
Oh, I’m sorry.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.844
The trains won't be
running for two years yet

01:10:30.912 --> 01:10:31.912
The way
we've been going.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.247
Oh. Well, you see,

01:10:33.315 --> 01:10:34.815
I- I own a lot of stock
in the company.

01:10:34.883 --> 01:10:37.151
I thought I’d just come down and
see how things were getting on.

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:38.819
Oh, you're
a stockholder.

01:10:38.887 --> 01:10:40.188
You got much stock?

01:10:40.255 --> 01:10:42.290
Sure. Uh, by the way,

01:10:42.357 --> 01:10:43.957
Do those things
go very fast?

01:10:44.025 --> 01:10:46.760
I mean, could you
go from here

01:10:46.828 --> 01:10:49.564
To, say, Madison Square
Garden and back in 10 minutes?

01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:50.830
Do they go that fast?

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.532
They sure do, miss.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.834
I got to walk,
but once in a while,

01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:56.169
I do a little
cheating-

01:10:56.237 --> 01:10:58.738
Steal a ride.

01:10:58.806 --> 01:11:02.108
Press a button,
and zip! I'm there.

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.610
Ah.

01:11:03.711 --> 01:11:05.378
Oh, uh, here.

01:11:05.446 --> 01:11:06.580
Buy yourself
another pipe-

01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:07.980
One that looks
less like a gun.

01:11:08.048 --> 01:11:08.915
Good night.

01:11:15.288 --> 01:11:16.455
Oh, Miss Manton.

01:11:18.124 --> 01:11:19.791
Mr. Norris.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.093
What are you doing here?

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.761
I've been
waiting for you.

01:11:22.829 --> 01:11:24.129
You know, I never
did thank you properly

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.598
For providing
that alibi.

01:11:25.665 --> 01:11:27.099
Oh.

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:29.801
Oh, that's all right.
You're welcome.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.370
I, uh, I can't
see you tonight.

01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:32.738
I won't keep you
a moment.

01:11:32.805 --> 01:11:34.172
I assure you.

01:11:59.865 --> 01:12:00.931
Don't you think
it's dangerous

01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:03.300
To be running around
without police protection?

01:12:03.368 --> 01:12:06.503
I have
police protection.

01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:08.272
Oh.

01:12:08.339 --> 01:12:10.240
I don't blame you
for ditching them.

01:12:14.512 --> 01:12:15.845
Cigarette?

01:12:15.913 --> 01:12:17.714
Never smoke.

01:12:17.782 --> 01:12:19.048
Will you
have a drink?

01:12:19.116 --> 01:12:20.384
Never drink.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.188
That's nice.

01:12:25.256 --> 01:12:26.289
Sit down.

01:12:39.503 --> 01:12:41.637
It's quiet.

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:43.872
Peaceful here,
isn't it?

01:12:46.543 --> 01:12:48.311
I'm tired
and sleepy.

01:12:48.378 --> 01:12:49.612
Won't you excuse me?

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.179
You look frightened.

01:12:52.915 --> 01:12:54.649
Maybe you'd better
have a cigarette.

01:13:01.824 --> 01:13:04.626
Don't make believe you're
not scared, because you are.

01:13:04.694 --> 01:13:07.195
Most people
are scared of me.

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:08.530
I'm not.

01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:10.665
As a matter of fact,
I like you.

01:13:12.501 --> 01:13:13.335
You do?

01:13:15.203 --> 01:13:17.471
Well, I...
I helped you.

01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:19.406
I helped your girlfriend
Frances Glesk.

01:13:19.474 --> 01:13:21.308
Well, that was
very nice of you,

01:13:21.376 --> 01:13:23.944
But Frances
is just a friend.

01:13:24.011 --> 01:13:25.946
There's only one woman
I ever really loved.

01:13:27.449 --> 01:13:28.982
Sheila Lane?

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:31.385
Yes.

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:34.388
I don't look like
a lover, do I?

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:37.123
Oh, yes, you do.
Very much.

01:13:37.191 --> 01:13:40.993
I used to sit
in my cell.

01:13:41.061 --> 01:13:43.863
You got lots
of time in prison.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.899
Even if you work all day,
there are the nights.

01:13:46.967 --> 01:13:49.068
Horrible nights.

01:13:49.135 --> 01:13:51.704
All I could think of
was Sheila...

01:13:51.772 --> 01:13:52.972
Married to somebody else.

01:13:54.641 --> 01:13:57.042
But I really
didn't mind because...

01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:59.779
I thought it was a great break
for her being married to Lane.

01:13:59.847 --> 01:14:03.348
He was a rich guy,
a banker.

01:14:07.052 --> 01:14:09.554
But did you know
he used to beat her?

01:14:11.123 --> 01:14:13.124
No.

01:14:13.192 --> 01:14:15.159
No, I didn't.

01:14:15.227 --> 01:14:17.829
I hated that guy.

01:14:17.897 --> 01:14:19.731
All I wanted
was to kill him.

01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:23.602
But when he was dead...

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:26.637
There wasn't any thrill
to look forward to anymore.

01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:35.880
Beldon saw me do it,
so I had to kill him, too.

01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:42.820
But now when I think
of it, it...

01:14:42.888 --> 01:14:44.422
It doesn't seem
to mean a thing.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.391
I'm wondering
how will it feel

01:14:47.459 --> 01:14:49.126
To kill somebody
I like.

01:14:52.262 --> 01:14:54.864
You think
that's strange?

01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:56.699
Yes. Very.

01:14:56.767 --> 01:14:58.902
I'm sorry to drag it
out like this.

01:14:58.969 --> 01:15:00.336
I would have done it
down at the subway

01:15:00.404 --> 01:15:03.372
When you found out how I got
downtown and back so quickly,

01:15:03.441 --> 01:15:04.307
But there
was that watchman.

01:15:06.276 --> 01:15:08.945
I don't think
you'd better answer it.

01:15:09.012 --> 01:15:10.079
If you don't
let me answer it,

01:15:10.147 --> 01:15:11.915
My maid
will be in here.

01:15:11.982 --> 01:15:13.015
All right.

01:15:15.217 --> 01:15:16.652
Hello?

01:15:18.187 --> 01:15:20.689
Oh, Peter. Um...

01:15:20.757 --> 01:15:23.091
No. I'm all right.

01:15:23.159 --> 01:15:25.260
Well, I
- I just didn't want any more policemen

01:15:25.328 --> 01:15:26.795
Cluttering up
my life.

01:15:26.863 --> 01:15:29.798
No.

01:15:29.866 --> 01:15:33.368
Of course, there's
nobody up here with me.

01:15:33.436 --> 01:15:34.837
All right.

01:15:36.906 --> 01:15:40.107
Good night, darling,
and I...

01:15:40.175 --> 01:15:42.076
I love you
very much.

01:15:48.784 --> 01:15:49.650
You better
put your coat on.

01:15:49.718 --> 01:15:50.751
It's chilly
on the street.

01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:52.353
But the police
might be outside.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.021
I don't know just where
Peter was calling from,

01:15:54.089 --> 01:15:55.656
But they had a lot
of men surrounding him.

01:15:55.724 --> 01:15:57.024
I know that. They almost got me tonight

01:15:57.092 --> 01:15:58.425
When I took that shot
at you at the club,

01:15:58.494 --> 01:15:59.360
But I was too smart
for them.

01:16:02.263 --> 01:16:03.262
Are you expecting
anyone?

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.832
No. I'm not
expecting anybody.

01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:15.542
If it's the police,

01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:17.110
Tell them
you're going to bed.

01:16:22.483 --> 01:16:23.850
Repeat what you said
over the phone.

01:16:23.918 --> 01:16:25.852
Oh, please go away.
I didn't say anything.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.653
What about that
"I love you very much"?

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:28.621
What a-

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:32.190
A gentleman caller.

01:16:32.258 --> 01:16:33.458
Melsa, are you
two-Timing me?

01:16:33.527 --> 01:16:35.360
I ought to give you
the beating of your life.

01:16:35.428 --> 01:16:36.862
You're lucky, Ames.

01:16:38.431 --> 01:16:40.465
She loves you
very much...

01:16:40.534 --> 01:16:43.002
Like Sheila
used to love me.

01:16:43.069 --> 01:16:45.203
Only you're lucky because you'll
never have to torture yourself

01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:47.172
Thinking of her being
married to someone else.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.508
What is all this?

01:16:49.576 --> 01:16:51.142
Tell him,
Miss Manton.

01:16:51.209 --> 01:16:52.577
He killed Lane
and Beldon.

01:16:52.645 --> 01:16:54.378
He used an electric
handcar in the new subway

01:16:54.446 --> 01:16:55.547
To get there
and back.

01:16:55.614 --> 01:16:57.081
Come on.

01:16:57.149 --> 01:17:01.019
Look. She gave you a break
with the alibi, Norris.

01:17:01.086 --> 01:17:03.922
I give you my word. We won't do
anything about this till tomorrow.

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:05.023
Take a head start
and beat it.

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:06.290
If they do nab you,

01:17:06.358 --> 01:17:07.692
I'll play you up
sympathetically in the papers.

01:17:07.826 --> 01:17:08.860
Go on.

01:17:13.465 --> 01:17:14.498
Don't speak to anyone.

01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:16.166
I don't want to kill
an innocent bystander.

01:17:16.233 --> 01:17:18.168
You know, that's what
I like about crazy men-

01:17:18.235 --> 01:17:20.136
That fine sense
of distinction.

01:17:20.204 --> 01:17:21.204
You think
I’m insane?

01:17:21.272 --> 01:17:23.073
Oh, he says that
to everybody.

01:17:29.213 --> 01:17:31.448
In case I forget
or...

01:17:31.515 --> 01:17:33.416
Maybe don't get another
chance to tell you,

01:17:33.484 --> 01:17:35.452
I'm very happy
to have loved you.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.428
Norris.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.030
Now, come on.
Drop that gun.

01:17:48.098 --> 01:17:50.332
Stay where you are,
Brent. You, too, coppers.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.902
Put it down, or you'll
never get out of here alive.

01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:54.804
Well, if I don't,
she won't, either.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:57.439
Now, Norris,
use your head.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.412
Now wait a minute, girls.
He's got a gun!

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.813
Stand back,
I tell you,

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.981
Or Manton
gets it.

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:07.882
If you kill her, you
have to kill all of us!

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.718
Oh, you're always
talking communism.

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.220
Norris...

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:12.787
Drop that gun.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.556
We're going
through.

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:16.425
You're not gonna get out of here alive.

01:18:16.493 --> 01:18:17.692
Go ahead.

01:18:30.805 --> 01:18:31.905
Ohh...

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.376
Darling,
it's all right.

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:36.910
Hilda listened in
on my phone call.

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.112
She always listens in
on my calls.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.113
She told me
Norris was there,

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:40.181
And we arranged
everything.

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:41.215
Why didn't
you tell me?

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.983
I didn't have a chance
to tell you.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.085
Oh, darling, let me
take you out of all this.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:46.154
That offer
still holds good.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.888
Let's get married right away. Today?

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.390
We'll go to South America for 6 months.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:50.357
Maybe we'll
never come back.

01:18:50.424 --> 01:18:51.324
Can you afford it?

01:18:51.392 --> 01:18:52.692
No, but you can.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.727
Isn't there a drop of
red blood in your veins?

01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:56.429
I want to live
on your income.

01:18:56.497 --> 01:18:58.798
That's foolish. Who's
gonna live on yours?

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.073
Sullivan...

01:19:07.141 --> 01:19:09.176
My bicarb tablets.

01:19:09.243 --> 01:19:12.245
Will you quit
crawling up on me?
