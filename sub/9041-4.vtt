WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:04.367
- THANKS FOR BRINGING ME
ON YOUR ROAD TRIP, RAYMOND.

00:04.367 --> 00:07.300
SURE GLAD I BROUGHT
THESE BINOCULARS.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.033
I CAN SEE
EVERY DROP OF RAIN

00:10.033 --> 00:11.800
HITTING
THE PIGGLY-WIGGLY.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.100
WELL...

00:14.100 --> 00:16.567
ONCE AGAIN, GOD,
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.433
- AAH, THAT'LL CLEAR UP.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.033
- YEAH, AND WHEN WILL
THAT BE, RAYMOND?

00:22.033 --> 00:23.833
ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS FOR THE ANIMALS

00:23.833 --> 00:25.167
TO LINE UP TWO BY TWO.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.433
- CHEER UP, WILL YA?

00:31.433 --> 00:32.967
GET SOMETHING FROM THE MINIBAR.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.133
- OH, MINIBAR...

00:34.133 --> 00:36.633
OOOH, WHOOPEE.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.467
HOW MUCH IS A SODA?

00:38.467 --> 00:40.000
- WHO CARES?
THE PAPER'S PAYING FOR IT.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.667
- I FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.000
- 57, 58, 59, 60,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.933
61, 62! OH, MAN!
ALMOST!

01:05.933 --> 01:07.933
- WILL YOU STOP
SPINNING YOUR RING ALREADY?

01:07.933 --> 01:10.200
- THIS TABLE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF SUPER-SLICK SURFACE, MAN.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.767
THIS COULD BE THE DAY
I BREAK THE RECORD.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.967
- YIPPEE!

01:14.967 --> 01:16.800
- QUIET!

01:16.800 --> 01:18.967
- CAN'T WE AT LEAST
GO BOWLING OR SOMETHING?

01:18.967 --> 01:21.233
- NO, NO, I'M HAVING
A GOOD TIME HERE.

01:21.233 --> 01:25.100
- YOU'RE TWIRLING JEWELRY.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.800
- YOU DON'T REALIZE
WHAT YOU GOT HERE, OKAY?

01:26.800 --> 01:28.633
YOU DON'T HAVE A WIFE
AND KIDS ALWAYS AROUND.

01:28.633 --> 01:30.767
YOU'RE ALONE.

01:30.767 --> 01:32.267
- THANK YOU.

01:32.267 --> 01:34.767
- IF I WAS HOME WITH THE KIDS,
I COULDN'T DO THIS. RIGHT?

01:34.767 --> 01:39.267
58, 59, 60--
AAH! ALMOST!

01:39.267 --> 01:43.800
BOWLING.
WE'RE IN PARADISE HERE.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.333
LOOK AT WHAT I'M DOING.
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM,

01:47.333 --> 01:48.900
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO LOCK THE DOOR.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.033
OR DO I?

01:55.667 --> 01:57.567
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.300
- I DON'T THINK I'D EAT THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

03:35.133 --> 03:39.500
- NO, I'M PLAYING
MY OWN KIND OF GAME.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.367
I PRETEND I'M A FISHERMAN.

03:43.833 --> 03:46.633
ALL RIGHT, RAY, LOOK,
I WAS SPINNING YOUR RING,

03:46.633 --> 03:48.233
AND...
- WHAT?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.500
- OH, WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?!

03:51.500 --> 03:54.367
- YEAH, YEAH BUT SEE IT'S JUST
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE VENT.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.667
WE CAN UNSCREW THE GRATE
AND JUST TAKE IT OUT.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.233
- LET ME GET MY HANDS IN THERE.
HOLD ON.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.200
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.267
THERE IT IS.

04:03.267 --> 04:04.900
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.600
[clinking]

04:15.767 --> 04:17.467
MILKY WAY?

04:22.033 --> 04:23.600
- YEAH, RIGHT OVER THERE.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.500
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH THE STUFF,

04:25.500 --> 04:26.567
AND I'LL GO GET
SOME PIZZA.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.567
YOU WANT A SLICE?

04:27.567 --> 04:28.900
- YEAH... WHAT ARE THEY,
A BUCK?

04:28.900 --> 04:34.433
WHY DON'T YOU BUY ME 500;
WE'LL BE EVEN.

04:34.433 --> 04:35.900
- RAY, I'M SURE
THE MAINTENANCE GUY

04:35.900 --> 04:37.900
IS GONNA FIND YOUR RING,
ALL RIGHT?

04:37.900 --> 04:39.000
- YEAH, DID YOU SEE THAT GUY?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.500
HE FINDS MY RING,
TWO SECONDS LATER

04:40.500 --> 04:42.267
HE'S GONNA TRADE IT IN
FOR A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

04:42.267 --> 04:45.367
AND A HARMONICA.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.033
- FOR THOSE PASSENGERS
TRAVELING

04:47.033 --> 04:50.600
ON FLIGHT 1477 TO NEW YORK,
BOARDING WILL BE DELAYED

04:50.600 --> 04:52.867
ANOTHER 45 MINUTES.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.933
- YOU BELIEVE THIS?

04:54.933 --> 04:56.967
- YEAH.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.733
- GOING HOME?

04:58.733 --> 05:00.233
- YEAH, GOING HOME.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.000
- YEAH, I'M FROM NEW YORK, TOO.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.167
ARE YOU RIGHT IN THE CITY?

05:04.167 --> 05:06.467
- ACTUALLY, LONG ISLAND.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.533
- OH? WHAT DO YOU DO THERE?

05:08.533 --> 05:12.767
- I'M A NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST
FOR A NEWSPAPER.

05:14.633 --> 05:15.800
- WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.433
I'M IN REAL ESTATE MYSELF.
ALEXIS.

05:19.433 --> 05:22.333
- UH, RAY. IS THIS--

05:22.333 --> 05:24.300
I MEAN, I ALREADY HAVE A HOUSE.

05:27.300 --> 05:30.100
- NO, NO, I'M OFF-DUTY.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.300
- OH, OKAY.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.100
- WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.067
I THINK I'LL GO OVER TO THE BAR
AND GET A DRINK.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.767
WOULD YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

05:42.733 --> 05:44.067
- OH! OH! YOU KNOW...

05:44.067 --> 05:47.000
I, UH...
ACTUALLY, I'M MARRIED.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.767
- OH! OH, MY GOD!
I'M SO SORRY.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.167
- THAT'S OKAY.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.300
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE A--
- I DIDN'T HAVE A RING.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.000
THAT'S 'CAUSE OF THIS GUY
RIGHT HERE.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.633
- WHAT'D I DO?

05:55.633 --> 05:57.667
- YOU LOST MY RING.
HE LOST MY RING,

05:57.667 --> 05:59.833
AND I SHOULD HAVE IT ON,
AND I DON'T, AND...

05:59.833 --> 06:01.367
I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

06:01.367 --> 06:02.633
- NO, REALLY, I'M SORRY.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.333
AND IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.067
- [chuckling]
HEY, IF I WASN'T MARRIED...

06:07.767 --> 06:11.167
- WELL, UH, THINK MAYBE
I'LL GO TO THE BAR

06:11.167 --> 06:13.200
AND HAVE BOTH OUR DRINKS.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.233
- I'M NOT MARRIED.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.667
- WOW.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.200
- SHE LIKED YOU.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.567
- YEAH, HOW 'BOUT THAT?

06:28.567 --> 06:29.733
- UNBELIEVABLE.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.200
A COUPLE OF HOURS
WITHOUT THE RING,

06:31.200 --> 06:34.300
YOU'RE ALREADY
GETTING OFFERS.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.967
IT REALLY, TRULY
NEVER ENDS FOR YOU, DOES IT?

06:38.967 --> 06:40.033
- AW, COME ON.
IT'S JUST...

06:40.033 --> 06:43.233
YOU KNOW,
IT'S THIS HAIRCUT.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.200
IT MAKES ME LOOK LATIN.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.067
- JUST TAKE YOUR PIZZA,
ALL RIGHT?

06:55.067 --> 06:56.267
- WHAT?
WHAT, MAN?

06:56.267 --> 06:58.267
- NO, NO, NOTHING.
HELL OF A WEEKEND, OKAY?

06:58.267 --> 06:59.500
JUST EAT YOUR SLICE.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.767
OH, LOOK, MINE'S THE ONE
WITH THE HAIR ON IT.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.600
- SHE WASN'T BAD-LOOKING, HUH?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.067
- YEAH, OKAY, RAYMOND.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.667
- HEY, YOU GOT TO FACE IT,
ROBERT.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.633
I STILL GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR THE LADIES.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.433
[yelping and hollering]

07:11.433 --> 07:13.767
- HEY, LADIES, A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU RIGHT HERE.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.700
YEAH.
LOOK.

07:21.533 --> 07:22.900
- HEY.
- HEY.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.333
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN LAST NIGHT.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.700
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.533
MY FLIGHT GOT IN LATE.
I DIDN'T EVEN UNPACK YET.

07:28.533 --> 07:29.767
HI.
- HI.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.733
HEY, I GOT SOME
OF THAT NEW CEREAL.

07:31.733 --> 07:32.867
YOU WANT TO TRY SOME?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.267
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
- JUST GET THE MILK.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.267
COULD YOU GET ME
SOME MORE JUICE, TOO, PLEASE?

07:40.267 --> 07:41.467
- YEAH.

07:44.167 --> 07:46.200
OH! WHOO! OH!

07:46.200 --> 07:47.767
I'LL GET IT.
I GOT IT.

07:47.767 --> 07:48.933
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.967
LET'S SEE WHAT
THAT NEW CEREAL'S ALL ABOUT.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.000
- HMM?
NOTHING.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.333
- WHAT'S WITH YOUR HAND?

08:30.333 --> 08:33.367
- NO. I JUST MADE
A LITTLE PUPPET.

08:33.367 --> 08:35.333
[high-pitched]
PASS THE ORANGE JUICE, TOOTS!

08:35.333 --> 08:38.100
HEY, COME ON,
THAT'S NOT NICE.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.600
"WHY? I'M THIRSTY. THAT'S ALL.
I'M JUST THIRSTY."

08:47.333 --> 08:48.767
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.767
I WANT YOU TO PREPARE YOURSELF,

08:50.767 --> 08:53.300
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GET VERY MAD

08:53.300 --> 08:55.200
AT ROBERT.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.833
- WHAT IS IT?

09:05.633 --> 09:07.033
WHERE'S YOUR WEDDING RING?

09:07.033 --> 09:08.900
- ROBERT.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.567
- ROBERT'S WEARING
YOUR WEDDING RING?

09:13.567 --> 09:15.633
- NO, NO, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,

09:15.633 --> 09:19.133
I HAD IT ON THE TABLE
IN THE HOTEL ROOM--

09:19.133 --> 09:21.733
- WERE YOU SPINNING IT AGAIN?

09:21.733 --> 09:24.200
- NO! NO!
ROBERT WAS SPINNING IT.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.567
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM
AND ROBERT,

09:25.567 --> 09:28.000
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME,
HE TAKES MY RING,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.633
HE SPINS IT
RIGHT INTO THE VENT!

09:29.633 --> 09:30.633
- THE VENT!
- YEAH.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.233
- DID YOU TRY TO GET IT OUT?

09:32.233 --> 09:33.467
- OF COURSE, YEAH!

09:33.467 --> 09:35.333
WE USED MILKY WAYS,
EVERYTHING.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.467
BUT THE MAINTENANCE GUY
AT THE HOTEL--

09:37.467 --> 09:39.933
HE SAID THAT HE WAS GONNA LOOK,
AND I'M SURE HE'LL COME THROUGH.

09:39.933 --> 09:44.133
HE LOOKED LIKE
A VERY DEPENDABLE GUY.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.300
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.567
HOW DID ROBERT
GET YOUR WEDDING RING

09:46.567 --> 09:47.600
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

09:47.600 --> 09:49.467
- I TOLD YOU
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

09:49.467 --> 09:50.867
- AND YOU TAKE
YOUR WEDDING RING OFF

09:50.867 --> 09:52.633
WHEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM?

09:52.633 --> 09:56.000
- IN A HOTEL BATHROOM, HUH?
IN A STRANGE CITY?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.867
THIS IS OUR WEDDING RING!
YOU BET YOUR ASS I DO!

10:03.433 --> 10:05.333
- WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
GET IT BACK OR NOT?

10:05.333 --> 10:06.733
- ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.433
- HEY! I'M WATCHING
SPORTSCENTER OVER HERE.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.633
- DAD!

10:10.633 --> 10:14.667
- MARIE'S DOING
HER FRENCH LESSON CRAP!

10:14.667 --> 10:16.033
I'D STOP HER,
BUT MAYBE SOMEDAY

10:16.033 --> 10:19.300
SHE'LL LEARN ENOUGH
TO MOVE THERE.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.833
- NOT NOW, FRANK, OKAY?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.167
- OH, SORRY.

10:25.167 --> 10:29.167
YOU TWO GOIN'
A COUPLE OF ROUNDS?

10:29.167 --> 10:30.167
- DAD, PLEASE, JUST--

10:30.167 --> 10:31.800
- DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HIM, DEB.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.667
ROBERT TOLD ME
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.967
HE SHOT HER DOWN REAL QUICK.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.733
- BOY, WOMEN OUT THERE
MUST BE GETTING DESPERATE

10:41.733 --> 10:43.967
IF THEY START
GOIN' AFTER BIG NOSE.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.767
- SO A WOMAN WAS
GOING AFTER YOU?

10:50.767 --> 10:52.267
- [chuckling]
NO...

10:52.267 --> 10:54.867
NO, IT WAS FUNNY, THOUGH.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.300
WE WERE AT THE AIRPORT,

10:56.300 --> 10:58.000
AND THIS WOMAN
WAS SITTING NEXT TO US,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.833
AND I GUESS BECAUSE
I DIDN'T HAVE A RING,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.933
SHE SAID "HI" OR WHATEVER...

11:01.933 --> 11:05.167
AND THEN THE FLIGHT WAS LATE,

11:05.167 --> 11:08.267
SO SHE ASKED ME TO GO TO THE BAR
AND HAVE A DRINK WITH HER.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.733
AND SO, RIGHT AWAY,
I SAID, "I'M MARRIED,"

11:15.733 --> 11:18.233
AND SHE SAID, "SORRY,"
AND LEFT.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.633
- WHAT'D SHE LOOK LIKE?

11:23.633 --> 11:24.967
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.
COME ON, COME ON.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.400
- SCALE OF ONE TO TEN.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.567
- GET OUT OF HERE,
WILL YA?

11:27.567 --> 11:29.400
- ALL RIGHT, I KNEW IT.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.100
PROBABLY A DUD, RIGHT?
- COME ON.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.000
- PROBABLY
ONE OF THOSE SHE-MALES.

11:39.667 --> 11:40.833
- IT WAS FUNNY,

11:40.833 --> 11:42.700
I ONLY HAD THE RING OFF
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS,

11:42.700 --> 11:46.300
AND I GET HIT ON,
LIKE I'M A STUD OR SOMETHING.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.633
- AND YOU LIKE THAT?

11:55.633 --> 11:58.133
- NO, I DON'T LIKE IT.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.833
BUT IT WAS FUNNY.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.267
ROBERT WAS STANDING THERE,

12:01.267 --> 12:02.667
AND SHE DIDN'T
SAY BOO TO HIM.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.500
- YOU SEEM PRETTY PROUD OF THIS.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.967
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.933
ACTUALLY, IT'S A COMPLIMENT
TO YOU. HMM?

12:13.367 --> 12:19.100
YOU'RE MARRIED TO A VERY
DESIRABLE MAN, HONEYBUN, HUH?

12:19.100 --> 12:21.667
BUT THE LADIES CAN WANT ME
ALL THEY WANT BECAUSE

12:21.667 --> 12:25.533
THERE AIN'T NO WOMAN
LIKE THE ONE I GOT

12:25.533 --> 12:27.700
WHAT? WHAT?

12:27.700 --> 12:29.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WAIT! IT WAS NOTHING!

12:29.300 --> 12:30.567
- IT'S NOTHING, HUH?

12:30.567 --> 12:32.533
- I AM STUCK HERE ALONE
WITH THE KIDS FOR THREE DAYS

12:32.533 --> 12:34.667
WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE
WITHOUT YOUR WEDDING RING

12:34.667 --> 12:35.967
AT AIRPORTS TALKING TO GIRLS!

12:35.967 --> 12:37.033
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

12:37.033 --> 12:38.433
THAT WOMAN ASKED ME
TO HAVE A DRINK,

12:38.433 --> 12:40.467
AND THE FIRST THING I SAID
WAS, "SORRY, I'M MARRIED!

12:40.467 --> 12:42.100
"MAYBE IF I WASN'T MARRIED,
BUT I CAN'T.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.233
I AM MARRIED!"

12:45.467 --> 12:49.333
- YOU SAID,
"IF I WASN'T MARRIED"?

12:51.600 --> 12:56.500
- OF COURSE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A JERK.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.100
- GOOD JOB.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.600
- COME BACK...

13:01.600 --> 13:04.567
I SAID WHATEVER I COULD
TO GET RID OF HER.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.400
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME!

13:09.367 --> 13:11.500
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.767
I KEPT MY HAND IN MY POCKET
THE WHOLE FLIGHT HOME

13:13.767 --> 13:15.333
SO PEOPLE WOULD
STOP HITTING ON ME.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.367
ALL RIGHT?

13:18.367 --> 13:21.200
WHICH EVEN IN BUSINESS CLASS
WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE!

13:21.200 --> 13:23.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.167
- I'M HELPING YOU UNPACK.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.667
- YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.400
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

13:39.400 --> 13:41.967
THEY ALREADY THINK YOU DRINK.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.533
- HI, DEAR.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.467
- HEY, MA.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.533
[whistle tweets]

14:03.533 --> 14:07.100
- YOUR FATHER TOLD ME
YOU MET SOMEONE AT THE AIRPORT.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.467
- I DIDN'T MEET SOMEONE.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.700
- WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

14:13.700 --> 14:16.567
- MOM, I'M NOT LOOKING
TO REPLACE DEBRA.

14:16.567 --> 14:20.433
- WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
DID I SAY THAT?

14:20.433 --> 14:22.400
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S NICE TO KNOW

14:22.400 --> 14:26.233
THAT OTHER WOMEN STILL FIND
MY BOY AS ATTRACTIVE AS I DO.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.233
THAT'S ALL.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.433
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.567
- MAYBE NOW DEBRA WILL START
TO APPRECIATE WHAT SHE HAS.

14:32.567 --> 14:36.800
MAYBE WEAR A LITTLE MASCARA
NOW AND THEN.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.267
- HEY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT KINDl
OF TREE YOU PLANTED OUT THERE,

14:39.267 --> 14:40.767
BUT IT'S GROWIN' SKIVVIES!

14:49.400 --> 14:50.667
- THANKS TO YOU,

14:50.667 --> 14:52.433
DEBRA THREW MY SUITCASE
OUT THE WINDOW THIS MORNING.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.833
- HEY, LISTEN, I WAS THINKIN'
OF TAKING A LITTLE FIELD TRIP

14:54.833 --> 14:56.467
TO LAGUARDIA
TO WATCH SOME FLIGHTS.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.133
YOU IN?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.733
- RAYMOND'S NOT INTERESTED
IN THOSE THINGS, FRANK.

15:02.733 --> 15:04.733
BUT, BY ALL MEANS, YOU GO.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.833
I'LL GET YOU A LIMO.

15:10.467 --> 15:12.267
- HEY, WHERE YA GOING,
TO GET THE KIDS?

15:12.267 --> 15:15.267
- GOING TO
THE GROCERY STORE FIRST.

15:15.267 --> 15:17.633
DID YOU TELL YOUR MOM
ALL ABOUT YOUR BIG SCORE?

15:17.633 --> 15:20.167
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.767
- WHAT ARE YOU SORRY ABOUT,
RAY?

15:21.767 --> 15:25.033
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE AIRPORT LADY.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.767
I'M SORRY
THAT YOU GOT JEALOUS.

15:30.433 --> 15:33.400
- LOOK, I'M NOT JEALOUS ABOUT
YOUR AIRPORT LADY, RAY.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.800
WHAT BOTHERS ME
IS YOUR ATTITUDE!

15:34.800 --> 15:36.767
YOUR ATTITUDE ABOUT ME,
ABOUT YOUR RING,

15:36.767 --> 15:38.733
AND ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.

15:38.733 --> 15:40.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MY MARRIAGE?

15:40.333 --> 15:42.300
LISTEN, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY MARRIAGE.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.133
MAYBE YOUR MARRIAGE.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.933
- MAYBE MY MARRIAGE.

15:51.433 --> 15:55.033
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME, RAY?

15:55.033 --> 15:58.300
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
NOT TO SPIN YOUR RING?

15:58.300 --> 16:00.200
THAT'S YOUR WEDDING RING,
RAY!

16:00.200 --> 16:01.467
IT'S NOT A TOY!

16:01.467 --> 16:03.133
- IT DOES SPIN.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.333
- OKAY, GREAT.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.067
- OH, MY GOD!

16:09.067 --> 16:11.067
- SPIN THESE.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.867
- COME ON, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
WHERE YOU GOING?

16:12.867 --> 16:14.267
- I'M GOING
TO THE GROCERY STORE.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.167
I'LL WEAR MY RING
WHEN YOU WEAR YOURS.

16:20.533 --> 16:23.300
- YOU LETTIN' HER GO THERE
WITHOUT A WEDDING RING?

16:23.300 --> 16:24.833
- YEAH, SO?

16:24.833 --> 16:26.767
- COME ON, A GROCERY STORE?

16:26.767 --> 16:29.033
IT ACTUALLY IS A MEAT MARKET.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.767
YOU SEND YOUR LITTLE LADY
OUT INTO A MAN'S WORLD

16:35.767 --> 16:38.067
WITH A NAKED FINGER?

16:38.067 --> 16:42.033
IT'S LIKE BANANA TIME
IN THE MONKEY CAGE!

16:46.867 --> 16:48.433
- THAT'S STUPID.

16:48.433 --> 16:51.567
- OH, YEAH?
THEN WHERE YA GOIN'?

16:51.567 --> 16:53.133
- I JUST REMEMBERED

16:53.133 --> 16:55.733
THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE
NEED AT THE STORE, ALL RIGHT?

16:55.733 --> 16:57.800
- I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.
YOU NEED A BIG SPONGE...

16:57.800 --> 16:58.967
- ALL RIGHT, MA.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.267
OKAY.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.600
- YOUR REFRIGERATOR IS JUST...

17:02.600 --> 17:06.433
- HOW COME THEY GET THEIR RINGS
TO COME OFF SO EASY?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.567
YOU DID THIS TO ME...

17:12.567 --> 17:14.100
WITH YOUR COOKING.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.900
YOU FATTENED ME UP
SO I COULDN'T GET OUT.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.400
[clattering]

17:40.100 --> 17:42.533
- WOW! MAN, YOU JUST PLOWED
RIGHT INTO HER!

17:42.533 --> 17:44.033
- I'M SORRY.
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY.

17:44.033 --> 17:45.733
ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:47.633 --> 18:49.067
- SORRY!

19:07.167 --> 19:09.167
HI.
- HELLO.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.000
- YOU KNOW, I CAN NEVER TELL.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF A MANGO IS RIPE OR NOT?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.733
- I DON'T KNOW.
SQUEEZE 'EM OR SOMETHING.

19:18.733 --> 19:23.133
- SO, GOSH.
IS THIS ONE RIPE?

19:23.133 --> 19:26.800
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I REALLY DON'T EAT FRUIT.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.400
- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT SELECTION OF LETTUCE.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.100
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.867
- YUP, A LOT OF LETTUCE.

19:38.567 --> 19:42.033
- SO...WHAT ARE YOU, UH...

19:42.033 --> 19:44.533

19:44.533 --> 19:46.200

19:48.833 --> 19:50.733
TILL THEY ALLOW ME BACK
AT THE DELI COUNTER.

19:56.867 --> 19:57.933
- I LOVE HOW IT...

19:57.933 --> 19:59.000
[sniffs]

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
SMELLS AROUND HERE.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.133
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.000
I GOTTA GO SPRITZ THE PARSLEY,
ALL RIGHT?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.267
- OH, GREAT.

20:04.267 --> 20:05.633
- IT'S AT
THE LOADING DOCK.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.633
- OH, THE LOADING DOCK?
- YOU CAN'T COME BACK THERE.

20:07.633 --> 20:08.967
- I'M REALLY INTERESTED--
- LADY!

20:08.967 --> 20:12.533
PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.067
- NICE TALKIN' TO YOU, JIMMY.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.900
OKAY, THE FIRST GUY
WAS DEFINITELY GAY.

20:28.900 --> 20:33.100
AND JIMMY'S ALL WRAPPED UP
IN HIS WORK.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.067
- YOU KNEW I WAS WATCHING YOU?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.400
- SHUT UP.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.533
- COME ON, PLEASE,
CAN WE JUST GO HOME?

20:41.533 --> 20:45.000
- YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY MARRIED
TO AN OLD HAG!

20:45.000 --> 20:46.033
- BUT I LOVE HER.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.033
- YOU'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO LEAVE ME

20:50.033 --> 20:51.900
FOR SOME YOUNGER GIRL WHO'S
STUPID

20:51.900 --> 20:53.700
AND THINKS
YOU'RE DISTINGUISHED.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.667
- COME ON, I'M JUST HAVING
A GOOD WEEK, THAT'S ALL.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.700
- ALL RIGHT!

20:56.700 --> 20:58.033
- COULD WE JUST CHECK OUT,
PLEASE?

20:58.033 --> 21:00.067
- OH, SORRY.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.900
- THAT'S OKAY.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.200
- IT'S ME.
I WASN'T LOOKING.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.467
- OH, I'M MARRIED.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.767
- EXCUSE ME?

21:09.767 --> 21:11.633
- AND EVEN IF I WASN'T,
NO, THANK YOU.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.300
- HOW'S THAT?

21:18.300 --> 21:19.233
- PERFECT.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.867
- I ALMOST KILLED A LADY.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.833
OH, THANK GOD.

21:42.767 --> 21:45.200
- RAY, HOW LONG WERE YOU
IN THE SHOWER THIS MORNING?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.167
THERE'S NO HOT WATER
FOR ME NOW!

21:47.167 --> 21:49.133
YOU'RE SO INCONSIDERATE!
