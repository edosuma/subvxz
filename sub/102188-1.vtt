Let me hope He gon give me a job.

01:52.164 --> 01:54.455
(indistinct)

01:55.484 --> 01:58.345

But you, you can be the difference.

02:11.236 --> 02:14.604
All you have to do is believe in yourself.

02:14.604 --> 02:18.785
Don't go back into that
environment and get trapped.

believe in yourself, Akim.

12:25.425 --> 12:28.092
Got a couple more stops to make.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.751
- So, how long you doing.

12:33.751 --> 12:35.093
- About a nickel.

12:35.093 --> 12:37.784
- Shit, that's enough time
to get his mind right?

12:37.784 --> 12:38.904
- Real shit though.

12:38.904 --> 12:40.512
Hunter, real stand up nigga.

12:40.512 --> 12:42.413
Definitely got to get
him back in position.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.311
- All the way.

12:43.311 --> 12:45.311
He's family right there.

12:47.213 --> 12:51.546
(people speaking in the background)

12:59.004 --> 12:59.952
- Welcome home, man.

12:59.952 --> 13:01.035
Welcome home.

13:07.985 --> 13:10.039

13:10.039 --> 13:11.407
You looking good.

13:11.407 --> 13:12.968
Still strong.

13:12.968 --> 13:15.164
You ain't let that place
break you, not one bit.

13:15.164 --> 13:16.444
- You know, we might be able,

13:16.444 --> 13:17.563
but we ain't gonna break Han.

13:17.563 --> 13:18.530
- I know that's right.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.480
- How you doing though?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.706
- I say my blood pressure a
little high, but I'm all right.

13:22.706 --> 13:24.373
- Anything I can do?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.077
- Since you asked, it wouldn't hurt

13:28.077 --> 13:30.797
if you talk to your cousin Nicholas.

13:30.797 --> 13:34.430
Hunter, that boy is out of control.

13:34.430 --> 13:37.941
But maybe with you being
back, it'll do him some good.

13:37.941 --> 13:39.274
- I ain't seen him when I walked in.

13:39.274 --> 13:40.981
- Ain't no way of telling
where that damn boy at,

13:40.981 --> 13:44.374
but you really need to talk to him.

13:44.374 --> 13:45.970
- Don't worry, I will, auntie.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.054
- I know you will.

13:47.054 --> 13:49.332
- I got you, I got you.

13:49.332 --> 13:51.938
- Oh, now you're going in there,

13:51.938 --> 13:53.894
fix you a plate, get you something to eat.

13:53.894 --> 13:56.154
I don't make plenty of food for everybody.

13:56.154 --> 13:57.826
All right, get you a home cooked meal.

13:57.826 --> 13:58.793
Welcome home, baby.

13:58.793 --> 13:59.793
- Yes, maam.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.847
- You're tired, but it was well worth it.

14:11.847 --> 14:12.803
- Can't wait to get some.

14:12.803 --> 14:13.923
I know how you do now.

14:13.923 --> 14:14.887

14:14.887 --> 14:17.626
I've been doing that for years.

14:17.626 --> 14:19.125

14:19.125 --> 14:20.231

14:20.231 --> 14:22.835

14:22.835 --> 14:24.086

paper in your pocket.

14:24.086 --> 14:25.928
You home now.

14:25.928 --> 14:27.028
- I got a couple of things lined up,

14:27.028 --> 14:29.883
but I'm gonna start by getting a job.

14:29.883 --> 14:30.716
- A job?

14:33.019 --> 14:36.936
- Yeah, a fucking job,
nine to five employment.

14:38.187 --> 14:40.882
Why would you go with a
job in a team position now?

14:40.882 --> 14:42.478
- You ain't had to do nothing,

14:42.478 --> 14:44.299

14:44.299 --> 14:45.594
If you worried about parole,

14:45.594 --> 14:47.155

14:47.155 --> 14:48.482
I haven't put you on the books.

14:48.482 --> 14:49.906
Pay stubs, the whole nine man.

14:49.906 --> 14:51.239
Relax man, damn,

14:52.227 --> 14:54.831
- Well, what you expect me to do, V?

14:54.831 --> 14:56.655
Come out here and put
some packs on the block,

14:56.655 --> 14:58.611

neighborhood that don't care

14:58.611 --> 15:00.444
nothing about me, nah.

15:02.066 --> 15:05.430
- Yo, Hunter, niggas ain't

15:05.430 --> 15:06.758
Now I told you a lot of shit had changed

15:06.758 --> 15:07.969
since you've been gone.

15:07.969 --> 15:09.438
You wouldn't have to put
your hands on the shit,

15:09.438 --> 15:12.097
it's laid out for you.

15:12.097 --> 15:14.854
- No disrespect V, but I
ain't on that type of time

15:14.854 --> 15:16.617

15:27.960 --> 15:32.405

15:32.405 --> 15:33.322
- Oh, shit.

16:50.629 --> 16:54.616
- Yeah, sometimes that's when
I see things the clearest.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.157
- Yo, ever since you came home,

16:56.157 --> 16:58.285

17:02.614 --> 17:06.864
I just keep having this

17:08.449 --> 17:09.282
You know.

Once she crossed that line,

17:29.739 --> 17:31.849

17:31.849 --> 17:35.099
- Hey, yo, why are you telling me this?

17:36.237 --> 17:39.067
- Because I see you
traveling down that same path

17:39.067 --> 17:40.914
and it's only a matter of
time that you do something

17:40.914 --> 17:42.431
that you're gon regret.

17:42.431 --> 17:44.258
- Like what?

17:44.258 --> 17:46.363

- You tripping.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.989

17:51.989 --> 17:53.965
Don't think 'cause you came
home with some conscious shit,

17:53.965 --> 17:55.734

17:55.734 --> 17:56.965
Get the fuck out of here with that, Cuz.

17:56.965 --> 17:58.959
- Yo, ain't anybody trying to tell you

17:58.959 --> 17:59.912

17:59.912 --> 18:00.975
I'm just trying to get
you to see what I see,

18:00.975 --> 18:05.225
what I happened to go
through, what I went through.

18:40.629 --> 18:43.268
- Wake up, a good morning buffalo.

18:43.268 --> 18:46.801
Yes, it's me your host

Sunny with the higher

18:58.766 --> 18:59.713
I'm free.

18:59.713 --> 19:00.679
- That's a fact, man.

19:00.679 --> 19:01.632
When you get out?

19:01.632 --> 19:02.581

19:02.581 --> 19:03.533
Yesterday?

19:03.533 --> 19:04.481

19:05.582 --> 19:06.877
Get with me, bro, I got something for you.

19:06.877 --> 19:08.148

19:08.148 --> 19:09.343
- Get with me.

19:09.343 --> 19:11.093
- Absolutely, my guy.

19:34.744 --> 19:36.644

19:36.644 --> 19:38.121
- To what do I owe the pleasure?

19:38.121 --> 19:38.954
- Don't do that.

19:38.954 --> 19:40.109
- Don't do what?

19:40.109 --> 19:42.125
I ain't seen you since I left the county.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.160
You show up here like everything is good.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.212
- Listen Hunter, you have
every right to be upset.

19:46.212 --> 19:47.488
Well, let me explain.

19:47.488 --> 19:50.416
- Ain't nothing to explain, Bri.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.956
- Yo nigga, you act like he
wasn't out here doing you.

19:53.956 --> 19:55.438
After you left, I found out everything

19:55.438 --> 19:58.336

bitches and all that shit.

19:58.336 --> 20:00.376

You what do you want us to do,

20:01.209 --> 20:02.441
pick up where we left off.

20:02.441 --> 20:05.008
- No, but I thought we could
at least remain friends.

20:05.008 --> 20:07.320
- Bree, you're dead to me.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.237
- Oh, word, really, it's like that.

20:11.404 --> 20:14.145
Nigga, I'm not the enemy, boo.

20:14.145 --> 20:15.273
I would've thought that a like you

20:15.273 --> 20:16.564

20:16.564 --> 20:18.240

20:18.240 --> 20:19.716
but I guess not.

20:19.716 --> 20:21.061
It's too bad too.

20:21.061 --> 20:22.684
I was looking forward to
seeing what that prison

20:22.684 --> 20:24.396

It ain't up for discussion.

21:39.585 --> 21:40.501
- Man, fuck that, nigga.

That's what family do.

Okay.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.712
So, what'd you doing today?

22:48.413 --> 22:51.003

22:51.003 --> 22:53.045

You gotta catch up or a lot

Go on and take the car.

23:16.833 --> 23:20.357
The keys is up front on the table.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.113
You want a beer or something.

24:00.113 --> 24:01.177

24:21.095 --> 24:23.617
But I got tired after working, man.

24:23.617 --> 24:27.472
Working at night, you
should find it off so late.

24:27.472 --> 24:28.433
- Where you working at?

24:28.433 --> 24:30.935

24:30.935 --> 24:33.050
- How you get up in there?

24:33.050 --> 24:34.055

No, she pulled a couple of strings,

24:35.317 --> 24:36.397

Ain't really nothing to

watching your back.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.073

- I'm sure.

30:38.678 --> 30:39.511
- You all right though.

30:39.511 --> 30:40.344

30:45.172 --> 30:47.839
(hip hop music)

31:06.234 --> 31:07.386

31:08.219 --> 31:09.636
You already know.

31:15.936 --> 31:17.078

31:17.078 --> 31:18.078
- All right.

31:21.156 --> 31:21.989
It's all there.

31:21.989 --> 31:23.530
- Just that same fire from before, right?

31:23.530 --> 31:24.474
- No, that's something different,

31:24.474 --> 31:26.572
but that jumping out the pot.

31:26.572 --> 31:27.998
- All right, I bet, I'ma see what it do.

31:27.998 --> 31:31.847
But on another note, you need
to highlight your man, Nick.

31:31.847 --> 31:33.063
- Why, what up with him?

31:33.063 --> 31:34.850
- Shit, he came through
earlier this morning

31:34.850 --> 31:38.002
wildin' on them little niggas
that worked for the boy, Mon.

31:38.002 --> 31:39.130
- Oh yeah.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.378
- I know that he's your man and all that,

31:40.378 --> 31:42.418
but tell homie to watch himself.

31:42.418 --> 31:44.998
- Man, ain't nobody thinking
about them bitch ass niggas.

31:44.998 --> 31:49.103

homie to watch himself.

31:49.103 --> 31:51.386
- All right fam, I'll halla at him,

31:52.285 --> 31:53.118
Be looking out.

31:53.118 --> 31:53.951
- No doubt.

31:53.951 --> 31:54.951
- All right.

32:12.626 --> 32:15.026
- If I didn't know better, I
think you was following me.

32:15.026 --> 32:17.142
- Excuse me, do I know you?

32:17.142 --> 32:19.182
- You bumped into me earlier today.

32:19.182 --> 32:20.454
- No, you bumped into me.

32:20.454 --> 32:23.003
Get it right, sweetie.

32:23.003 --> 32:24.370
- Hunter.

32:24.370 --> 32:25.203
- April.

32:26.426 --> 32:27.850
- Need to let me do that
for you again sometime.

32:27.850 --> 32:31.242
- Do what, knock my paperwork on my hand?

32:31.242 --> 32:32.992
- No, make you smile.

32:40.403 --> 32:41.236
So, where are you from?

32:41.236 --> 32:42.714
- I'm from Buffalo.

32:42.714 --> 32:44.034
- No, what neighborhood you grew up in?

32:44.034 --> 32:46.542
- Oh, I'm from Dunaway.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.414
- Interesting.

32:48.414 --> 32:49.285
- Hmm, why is that interesting?

32:49.285 --> 32:52.210
Where'd you think I was from?

32:52.210 --> 32:55.045
- Cheektowaga, something like that.

32:55.045 --> 32:56.454
- So you're trying to say a bougie.

32:56.454 --> 32:57.686
- Not at all, not at all.

32:57.686 --> 33:01.602
The girl of Dunaway is not so powerless.

33:01.602 --> 33:02.574
- Oh, okay.

33:02.574 --> 33:04.314
Well, don't let the gray look for you,

33:04.314 --> 33:06.670
I'm very familiar with the hood.

33:06.670 --> 33:08.830
But after my brother Kevin got killed,

33:08.830 --> 33:10.420
I shied away from the streets.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.862
- I'm sorry, I know my bad.

33:11.862 --> 33:13.962
- That's okay, it was a long time ago,

33:13.962 --> 33:16.494
but what's up with you, what's your story?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.683
- What do you wanna know?

33:18.683 --> 33:23.683
- Okay, let me guess, ex drug
dealer, fresh from prison.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.491
Trying to stay out of streets,

33:25.491 --> 33:27.266
but you're not too far removed.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.183
Am I right?

33:29.126 --> 33:30.506
- You sound like the Fed.

33:30.506 --> 33:31.673
- I sound like the Fed?

33:31.673 --> 33:32.506
- Absolutely.

33:32.506 --> 33:35.666
- I told you, I'm very
familiar with the hood.

33:35.666 --> 33:37.002
I know your type.

33:37.002 --> 33:38.126
- My type.

33:38.126 --> 33:41.710
- Yes, guys like you are
hanging around in libraries

33:41.710 --> 33:45.370
or in coffee shops unless
you're looking for change.

33:45.370 --> 33:49.722
And that gray sweatsuit with
the coffee, dead give away.

33:49.722 --> 33:51.055
I'm just saying.

33:55.334 --> 34:00.334
♪ You believed in me I don't
know what you see in me ♪

34:00.473 --> 34:03.713
♪ But my heart you got the key ♪

34:03.713 --> 34:07.120

34:07.120 --> 34:11.037
♪ Can't you see and all I want ♪

34:14.622 --> 34:15.834
- So when am I gonna see you again?

34:15.834 --> 34:17.530
- Look, Hunter, you seem real cool,

34:17.530 --> 34:20.230
but I'm not tryna complicate
my life right now.

34:20.230 --> 34:22.406
- I ain't tryna complicate
your life, trust me.

34:22.406 --> 34:24.908
- So what is it that you want from me?

34:24.908 --> 34:26.994
- I'ma be real with you.

34:26.994 --> 34:28.810
It's been along the time
since I were able to have

34:28.810 --> 34:31.182
a decent conversation
with a beautiful woman.

34:31.182 --> 34:34.539
What I'm saying, all I
wanna do is see you again.

34:34.539 --> 34:36.564
- Oh, that's meant to be, you'll find me.

34:36.564 --> 34:37.570
- Why we gotta go through all that

34:37.570 --> 34:40.270
and I got you right here.

34:40.270 --> 34:43.302
- How about I give you my card

34:43.302 --> 34:46.766
and you give me a call next
time you're at the library.

34:46.766 --> 34:47.666
- So like that.

34:47.666 --> 34:48.499
- Aboslutely.

34:48.499 --> 34:49.999
Take care, Hunter.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.817
(hip hop music)

35:03.410 --> 35:05.542
- Bitch, what you think it is.

35:05.542 --> 35:08.510
Oh, now that dress is cold.

35:08.510 --> 35:10.550
And wait didn't you get
some like Balenciaga booties

35:10.550 --> 35:12.022
or something when we was in Miami.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.422
I think they was like
black and black and red.

35:14.422 --> 35:15.255
- Yeah.

35:16.446 --> 35:17.766
Those would go perfect with that.

35:17.766 --> 35:18.846
- Yeah, I think I'm going to get it.

35:18.846 --> 35:21.940
Excuse me, you got this
dress in a size eight?

35:21.940 --> 35:22.773
- I'll check.

- Thank you.

35:24.670 --> 35:25.706
So bitch.

I know that nigga happy to see you.

35:28.522 --> 35:29.798
- Girl, Hunter.

35:29.798 --> 35:32.061

35:32.061 --> 35:34.078
Bitch, I went to go halla at that nigga,

35:35.474 --> 35:36.732
Don't you know that nigga
was acting weird as hell.

35:36.732 --> 35:39.194
- What do you mean by weird?

35:39.194 --> 35:41.234
- Weird, like weird, weird, I don't know.

35:41.234 --> 35:43.948
Like I guess he's still on his feelings.

35:43.948 --> 35:46.154

35:46.154 --> 35:48.194
And these is crazy.

They get locked up, expect
the to sit in the house

35:50.683 --> 35:52.798
and wait for they ass to come home.

35:52.798 --> 35:53.670
- Exactly.

35:53.670 --> 35:55.198
- Ain't nobody doing that shit.

35:55.198 --> 35:57.178
Nobody get with it and stop tripping.

35:57.178 --> 35:58.258
- I ain't even worried about it.

35:58.258 --> 35:59.278
Hunter will get over it.

35:59.278 --> 36:00.695
It is what it is.

36:02.778 --> 36:04.186
- Thanks mama.

36:04.186 --> 36:06.078

That boy's got a chit.

All I'm saying is let shit die down

37:11.866 --> 37:13.426

What's up with you?

40:07.449 --> 40:09.790

40:09.790 --> 40:11.163

I have a client I have to

40:14.014 --> 40:16.047
Why, what's going on with you.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.027

beautiful real estate agent

40:18.027 --> 40:19.510

40:34.340 --> 40:35.923
Good night, Hunter.

41:07.245 --> 41:08.499

41:08.499 --> 41:10.316
- I was a little curious.

41:10.316 --> 41:12.411
- You had a feeling,
you're feeling that nigga.

41:12.411 --> 41:14.967
- Don't flatter yourself,
I'm not feeling the nigga.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.322
Curious about the food, I told you that.

41:16.322 --> 41:17.155
- Stop it.

41:19.011 --> 41:19.844
- Okay.

44:37.856 --> 44:39.919
Last time I heard you were
trying to fight straight.

44:39.919 --> 44:41.192
- I was considering some of the options,

44:41.192 --> 44:43.964
like they say, old habits die hard.

44:43.964 --> 44:44.797

44:44.797 --> 44:46.388

45:29.271 --> 45:30.595
So what's up?

45:30.595 --> 45:32.491

45:32.491 --> 45:34.027

45:34.027 --> 45:36.073

45:37.605 --> 45:41.186

and somebody needs to
come and knock the cobwebs

46:21.977 --> 46:23.163

47:04.490 --> 47:05.780
with collections.

47:05.780 --> 47:06.780
- Well, sir.

47:11.073 --> 47:14.342
Well, I don't have any
experience at all in collections

47:14.342 --> 47:16.880
but I am a fast learner and I am willing

47:16.880 --> 47:18.465
to do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

47:18.465 --> 47:19.307

47:21.734 --> 47:22.771

47:22.771 --> 47:25.232

little gap in your history.

47:25.232 --> 47:26.996
It looks like you're doing a
little bit of time in prison.

47:26.996 --> 47:28.497
You wanna elaborate on that a little bit?

47:28.497 --> 47:30.182
- I did do some time in prison.

Five years for conspiracy
charges a couple of years back,

47:34.388 --> 47:36.796
but I promise you that life is behind me.

47:36.796 --> 47:38.612
And I'm focused.

48:06.825 --> 48:09.000
I'm gonna put you in

48:15.093 --> 48:15.982

48:15.982 --> 48:17.680

eyeing when you was walking

48:17.680 --> 48:18.727

48:18.727 --> 48:19.644
I saw that.

48:20.988 --> 48:21.829

48:21.829 --> 48:22.669
Thank you for everything.

51:05.594 --> 51:07.177

51:09.707 --> 51:11.972

Trying to get a pack, man.

But shit, I'll take your number, man.

You never know when I need you.

Yo, that's a good plug.

52:12.638 --> 52:15.018
Man, you can't be fucking

52:15.018 --> 52:16.455
- Man, he all right, he good?

52:16.455 --> 52:17.767

52:20.198 --> 52:21.914
I got the nigga money right here.

52:21.914 --> 52:22.788

52:22.788 --> 52:23.697

52:23.697 --> 52:24.887
Oh man here, man.

52:24.887 --> 52:26.970
It just lead to flooding.

52:30.334 --> 52:31.664
- We can set up a payment arrangement.

52:31.664 --> 52:32.709
- I get it, but if not,
they're gonna charge you

52:32.709 --> 52:36.699
another fee, especially
if this is official font.

52:36.699 --> 52:37.838
- Okay, we can do that for you.

52:37.838 --> 52:39.275
- Arbitrary--

52:39.275 --> 52:40.148
- I don't have any other choice

52:40.148 --> 52:44.815
but to garnish your wages
beginning the next pay period.

52:46.098 --> 52:47.163
- I can speak to the man on your behalf,

52:47.163 --> 52:48.039

of reset resolution.

52:48.039 --> 52:48.917

Okay, I'm gonna place you on a brief hold,

52:52.239 --> 52:54.409
I'm gonna transfer you over

Okay?

Thank you, have a great day.

52:58.577 --> 53:00.919
- Ryan, I need you to finish setting up

53:00.919 --> 53:03.453
this payment arrangement for
me while I get him settled in.

53:03.453 --> 53:05.786
- No problem, send him over.

53:06.939 --> 53:09.077
I'm just a mediator
between you and the client.

53:09.077 --> 53:10.660
- Now you see here.

53:14.779 --> 53:16.828
Okay, this is where you'll
be for the time being.

53:16.828 --> 53:18.695
You're gonna need script, a long sheet

53:18.695 --> 53:20.869
so you can keep track
of all of your contact.

53:20.869 --> 53:21.779
- Okay.

53:21.779 --> 53:22.657
- All right.

53:22.657 --> 53:23.548
- Yes.

53:23.548 --> 53:24.425
- Okay, I'll be back.

53:24.425 --> 53:25.425
- Thank you.

53:36.759 --> 53:37.876

53:43.935 --> 53:45.685
Let me see something.

53:49.691 --> 53:51.002

53:51.002 --> 53:54.978
- Boy, I had a big ass ass last night.

53:54.978 --> 53:57.269

I popped to Magritte cafe

54:04.148 --> 54:06.481

54:07.471 --> 54:08.348
- The fuck man.

54:08.348 --> 54:10.341
You gotta slow down, man.

54:10.341 --> 54:12.287

54:15.257 --> 54:16.424

54:17.359 --> 54:18.951
Don't come around here
like you came last time

54:18.951 --> 54:20.229
with that bullshit.

54:20.229 --> 54:22.661
(indistinct)

54:22.661 --> 54:23.678
- I got it, man.

54:23.678 --> 54:26.428
- I got something for you though.

54:27.336 --> 54:30.336
(suspenseful music)

54:50.308 --> 54:52.558
(gunshots)

55:00.407 --> 55:02.108
- What the fuck.

55:02.108 --> 55:03.111
- Yo.

55:03.111 --> 55:04.508
- Bro, what the fuck.

55:04.508 --> 55:05.341
- No, bro.

55:24.616 --> 55:27.117
- Here's what I'm gonna do, Larry.

55:27.117 --> 55:29.623
If you could come up with $200 a day,

55:29.623 --> 55:34.245
we can make the arrangement
for you to pay $150 biweekly.

55:34.245 --> 55:36.678
Does that sounded like something
that you're willing to do.

55:36.678 --> 55:38.263
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

55:38.263 --> 55:40.761
- I'm gonna transfer you
over processing department.

55:40.761 --> 55:43.303
They're gonna make the
arrangement with you, okay.

55:43.303 --> 55:44.507
All right, man.

55:44.507 --> 55:45.924
Good luck to you.

55:51.309 --> 55:55.809
He yo, Ryan, I got one in
line about to transfer over.

55:55.809 --> 55:57.127
- Okay.

55:57.127 --> 55:58.127
- All right.

56:04.539 --> 56:07.634
- So you said you never
did collections before?

56:07.634 --> 56:11.018
- No, I never did collection before.

56:11.018 --> 56:12.587
- I was listening to
you talking to my desk

56:12.587 --> 56:13.810
and I'm impressed.

56:13.810 --> 56:15.279
- Thank you.

56:15.279 --> 56:16.752
- You're a natural.

56:16.752 --> 56:17.655
Keep it up.

56:17.655 --> 56:18.488
Great job.

56:22.066 --> 56:23.899
- Stay focused Hunter.

56:26.074 --> 56:27.744
- Monday we'll send you the documents.

56:27.744 --> 56:29.328
But (indistinct) for foreclosure,

56:29.328 --> 56:30.250
there's nothing I can do.

56:30.250 --> 56:31.920
All you can do is send the
documents to my attorney

56:31.920 --> 56:34.391
and then we'll email you back.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.641
All right, have a good day.

56:38.380 --> 56:39.213
Hi baby.

56:41.045 --> 56:42.765
- What's good, babe.

56:42.765 --> 56:43.973
You've been out here long?

56:43.973 --> 56:45.792
- No, not too long.

56:45.792 --> 56:48.088
So, how was your first day?

56:48.088 --> 56:51.387
- Man, that shit was
long, but it was cool,

56:51.387 --> 56:52.804
it was all right.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.130
What's good, pimp.

57:01.130 --> 57:03.063
(indistinct)

57:03.063 --> 57:04.236
Shit, I'm on a car (indistinct)

57:04.236 --> 57:05.911
What's the matter.

57:05.911 --> 57:07.804
- It's not good, Hunter.

57:07.804 --> 57:08.971
Nick got shot.

57:09.863 --> 57:12.039
- Yo, don't tell me no
shit like that, bro.

57:12.039 --> 57:14.183
- Nah, it's ugly bro.

57:14.183 --> 57:15.111
It's ugly.

57:15.111 --> 57:17.875
- Yo get the fuck outta here.

57:17.875 --> 57:18.792
Is he dead?

57:19.627 --> 57:21.044
- It's real ugly.

57:23.139 --> 57:23.972
- Fuck.

57:24.967 --> 57:26.050
- What, baby.

57:27.623 --> 57:28.456
What?

57:30.203 --> 57:32.635
- Motherfuckers have murdered
my little cousin, man.

57:32.635 --> 57:33.468
- What?

57:35.807 --> 57:37.383
I'm sorry.

57:37.383 --> 57:39.966
(somber music)

57:58.446 --> 58:00.844
- I hope all your wishes,
ideas and dreams come true.

58:00.844 --> 58:02.927
I love you nigga, salute.

58:04.958 --> 58:07.458
- Why are you telling me this?

58:10.058 --> 58:12.811
- 'Cause I see you
traveling in the same path.

58:12.811 --> 58:14.115
- I thought I told you niggas,

58:14.115 --> 58:16.698
if you getting no work from us.

58:22.098 --> 58:23.206
Let me know when you figure it out.

58:23.206 --> 58:26.340
Until then, you know where I'ma be.

58:26.340 --> 58:29.494
- A lot of time you could do
something that you will regret.

58:29.494 --> 58:30.902
- Like what.

58:30.902 --> 58:32.974
- Man, it is what the fuck it is nigga.

58:32.974 --> 58:35.557
(somber music)

58:50.841 --> 58:54.852
- Yo fam, it's time to
lead a murder game down.

58:54.852 --> 58:56.996
Streets gotta bleed for
what they did to Nick.

58:56.996 --> 59:00.264
I'm not playing with none
of these niggas, man.

59:00.264 --> 59:02.681
- Yo, what the fuck happened?

59:03.880 --> 59:07.016
- They found him slumped in
a yard like a goddamn dog.

59:07.016 --> 59:07.976
- Who is they?

59:07.976 --> 59:10.468
- Styles and little niggas from the hood.

59:10.468 --> 59:12.116
- And nobody's saying what happened?

59:12.116 --> 59:14.546
- Nah, but he got into a
situation the other day.

59:14.546 --> 59:17.049
- What type of situation?

59:17.049 --> 59:20.173
- He got into with that
little nigga, Myron.

59:20.173 --> 59:22.801
- Myron, the fuck is Myron?

59:22.801 --> 59:27.213
- Man, fuck with the boy,
Mon up on Kensington.

59:27.213 --> 59:30.117
- Talking about the little Mon

59:30.117 --> 59:32.493
with Camren niggas.

59:32.493 --> 59:35.853
- Yo, making a little bit
of noise, making some bread.

59:35.853 --> 59:37.381
I don't give a fuck about none of that.

59:37.381 --> 59:39.138
And they're gon get it too.

59:39.138 --> 59:41.430
- I just told this nigga to fall back, man

59:41.430 --> 59:43.505
with all that wild shit, man.

59:43.505 --> 59:44.525
The fuck, man.

59:44.525 --> 59:47.442
- Yo bro, that's besides the point.

59:49.532 --> 59:51.365
Fuck you trying to do.

59:54.753 --> 59:57.086
You already know what it is.

1:00:04.383 --> 1:00:05.300
- Hey, hey.

1:00:07.291 --> 1:00:08.308
Hey Hunter.

1:00:08.308 --> 1:00:10.923
You know I had to come see you
and give you my condolences.

1:00:10.923 --> 1:00:14.370
I'm so sorry to hear about Nick.

1:00:14.370 --> 1:00:18.558
- (indistinct) did it dirty, bro.

1:00:18.558 --> 1:00:21.141
I can't fucking think straight.

1:00:22.067 --> 1:00:23.807
The more I tried to do right,

1:00:23.807 --> 1:00:25.641
the more of the bullshit pull at me,

1:00:25.641 --> 1:00:27.238
trying to reel me back in, man.

1:00:27.238 --> 1:00:31.194
- The sad reality is though,
just 'cause you found yourself

1:00:31.194 --> 1:00:34.611
doesn't mean our loved ones did the same.

1:00:37.706 --> 1:00:42.456
- Nick was out there, fam and
I know what come with that.

1:00:43.482 --> 1:00:44.859
That's my family bro

1:00:44.859 --> 1:00:45.970
and I ain't letting that shit go.

1:00:45.970 --> 1:00:47.279
- Hunter, it's done.

1:00:47.279 --> 1:00:49.620
We can't lose you again.

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:52.502
Don't let them boys knock
you off your square, man.

1:00:52.502 --> 1:00:53.335
Come on man.

1:00:53.335 --> 1:00:55.834
The town know how you give it up.

1:00:55.834 --> 1:00:58.667
And you gon' just go back to that?

1:00:59.677 --> 1:01:00.510
- I ain't doing it for them,

1:01:00.510 --> 1:01:01.769
don't do it for me.

1:01:01.769 --> 1:01:03.869
- Hunter, you got family out here.

1:01:03.869 --> 1:01:06.038
They finally see a change in you

1:01:06.038 --> 1:01:07.529
and a little bit of tribulation come

1:01:07.529 --> 1:01:09.689
and you revert back to your ways.

1:01:09.689 --> 1:01:11.096
Come on.

1:01:11.096 --> 1:01:13.213
- So what am I supposed to do, bro.

1:01:13.213 --> 1:01:14.757
- Look around us.

1:01:14.757 --> 1:01:17.112
You see the environment we in.

1:01:17.112 --> 1:01:20.325
The prophets forewarn this,
they hope that it would stop.

1:01:20.325 --> 1:01:23.205
But me and you can't keep hoping it stop.

1:01:23.205 --> 1:01:24.622
We gotta stop it.

1:01:28.194 --> 1:01:29.549
- I feel you.

1:01:29.549 --> 1:01:31.845
- Hunter, I'ma leave you with this.

1:01:31.845 --> 1:01:34.981
A righteous man is one
who submits his will

1:01:34.981 --> 1:01:37.185
to do the will of God.

1:01:37.185 --> 1:01:41.009
And the question you gotta
ask yourself, is it God's will

1:01:41.009 --> 1:01:43.573
for you to Vince Nick's death?

I'm talking straight goblin.

1:11:18.908 --> 1:11:21.386
- Hey my man, Hunter,

1:21:54.604 --> 1:21:57.204
What's the matter, why are you crying?

1:21:57.204 --> 1:21:58.763
- Just thinking about my brother.

1:21:58.763 --> 1:22:00.836
I'm all right though.

1:22:00.836 --> 1:22:02.940
- You miss him, don't you?

1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:06.190
- You have no idea how much I miss him.

1:22:07.096 --> 1:22:08.429
He was my heart.

1:22:09.524 --> 1:22:12.107
Kevin's death was so premature.

1:22:12.942 --> 1:22:16.025
He was so ambitious and full of life.

1:22:17.008 --> 1:22:21.448
I just don't understand
why anybody would hurt him.

1:22:21.448 --> 1:22:23.652
- Babe, sometime God
allow things to happen

1:22:23.652 --> 1:22:25.812
that we don't understand.

1:22:25.812 --> 1:22:28.499
- I'm not questioning God, baby.

1:22:28.499 --> 1:22:30.416
I just miss my brother.

1:22:31.390 --> 1:22:33.685
You would have loved him.

1:22:33.685 --> 1:22:37.152
- If he was anything like
you, I know I would have.

1:22:37.152 --> 1:22:40.897
- You have so many of the same
characteristics, it's crazy.

1:22:40.897 --> 1:22:44.367
There's so much how am I seeing you.

1:22:44.367 --> 1:22:45.638
That's why it scares me to see you

1:22:45.638 --> 1:22:48.448
go back to your old ways, baby.

1:22:48.448 --> 1:22:51.611
- Babe, you already know
what I'm doing is temporary.

1:22:51.611 --> 1:22:56.096
- But Hunter, something
bad is gonna happen.

1:22:56.096 --> 1:22:57.536
- Why do you keep saying that?

1:22:57.536 --> 1:23:01.916
- Baby, because I can't
explain it, but I can feel it.

1:23:01.916 --> 1:23:03.508
This is the exact same way I felt

1:23:03.508 --> 1:23:05.908
before Kevin got killed.

1:23:05.908 --> 1:23:09.148
Something bad is gonna happen, babe.

1:23:09.148 --> 1:23:12.971
- You need to relax and stop worrying.

1:23:12.971 --> 1:23:15.236
Everything will be all right.

1:23:15.236 --> 1:23:16.903
Trust me, all right.

1:23:17.772 --> 1:23:18.760
- If you say so.

1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:20.532
- Come here.

1:23:20.532 --> 1:23:22.949
(slow music)

1:24:19.321 --> 1:24:20.154
Get that back.

1:24:20.154 --> 1:24:20.987
- Yo, Hunter, what are you doing, man.

1:24:20.987 --> 1:24:23.056
- Don't do that, I'll
need that back from you.

1:24:23.056 --> 1:24:24.223
- Come on man.

1:24:25.248 --> 1:24:28.248
(suspenseful music)

1:24:40.784 --> 1:24:43.034
(gunshots)

1:25:01.620 --> 1:25:04.037
(slow music)

1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:38.193
- Egypt to this or LA.

1:25:41.459 --> 1:25:42.292
- It's Hunter.

1:25:42.292 --> 1:25:43.125
- Hunter.

1:25:45.268 --> 1:25:46.768
Hunter, what's up.

1:25:51.096 --> 1:25:52.429
So it's all set.

1:25:53.272 --> 1:25:55.522
All right, we'll handle it.

1:25:57.693 --> 1:25:59.644
Excuse me, fellas.

1:25:59.644 --> 1:26:02.227
(upbeat music)

1:26:23.452 --> 1:26:25.340
- Hey yo, fam, what's good up there, man.

1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:26.764
What's going on.

1:26:26.764 --> 1:26:30.591
- Things are good, business is good,

1:26:30.591 --> 1:26:32.856
but there's a thing we need taken care of.

1:26:32.856 --> 1:26:34.416
- Are you saying you need me?

1:26:34.416 --> 1:26:35.913
- Yeah, we wanna need you.

1:26:35.913 --> 1:26:37.700
It should be and and out.

1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:38.768
- Say less yo.

1:26:38.768 --> 1:26:40.416
You know I'm on the way.

1:26:40.416 --> 1:26:42.080
- I'll see you when you get here.

1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:42.913
- One.

1:26:45.004 --> 1:26:47.900
- Yo man, take me to Buffalo.

1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:50.483
(upbeat music)

1:27:25.864 --> 1:27:28.040
- Boy, who car you got.

1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:29.332
- That's my car, auntie.

1:27:29.332 --> 1:27:31.072
I got it yesterday.

1:27:31.072 --> 1:27:32.572
- Oh, that's nice.

1:27:35.376 --> 1:27:36.876
- You like that, huh.

1:27:36.876 --> 1:27:38.992
- Yeah, it's nice and fancy.

1:27:38.992 --> 1:27:41.325
You know I liked that fancy.

1:27:44.598 --> 1:27:45.431
- How are you feeling?

1:27:45.431 --> 1:27:46.688
Do you need something?

1:27:46.688 --> 1:27:49.189
- No baby, I'm all right.

1:27:49.189 --> 1:27:51.189
I'm all right, I'm okay.

1:27:55.896 --> 1:27:57.608
Some days is better than others,

1:27:57.608 --> 1:28:00.691
but hey, as long as I keep waking up,

1:28:04.324 --> 1:28:07.279
God will keep blessing me.

1:28:07.279 --> 1:28:09.647
- And that's what's important.

1:28:09.647 --> 1:28:10.480
- Yeah.

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:13.824
But how are you?

1:28:13.824 --> 1:28:17.904
- I'm cool, I ain't got no
complaints, I'm chilling.

1:28:17.904 --> 1:28:20.737
- No, Hunter, how you really doing

1:28:23.615 --> 1:28:26.698
because I see that look in your eyes.

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:31.026
- You know, some days
better than others, auntie,

1:28:31.026 --> 1:28:32.604
I ain't gon lie to you.

1:28:32.604 --> 1:28:35.212
Life might be pulling on
me in every direction.

1:28:35.212 --> 1:28:39.024
I don't know if I'm coming
and going some days.

1:28:39.024 --> 1:28:40.274
- I understand.

1:28:42.096 --> 1:28:44.763
Baby, let me tell you this much.

1:28:46.088 --> 1:28:49.852
You're a good person with a pure heart.

1:28:49.852 --> 1:28:52.072
And I am so proud.

1:28:52.072 --> 1:28:56.048
So proud of the man that you have become.

1:28:56.048 --> 1:28:57.048
- Thank you.

1:28:58.524 --> 1:29:00.040
I'm trying.

1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:01.207
- I know baby.

1:29:02.825 --> 1:29:07.268
You got a lot of potential,
a lot of potential,

1:29:07.268 --> 1:29:10.867
but I don't want you to let
what happened to Nicholas

1:29:10.867 --> 1:29:14.034
digress you from what God has for you.

1:29:16.496 --> 1:29:18.552
- Auntie, I'm not (indistinct).

1:29:18.552 --> 1:29:20.302
- No, I'm not stupid.

1:29:22.288 --> 1:29:25.705
I see you falling back into your old ways

1:29:26.678 --> 1:29:29.320
and that's not what I want for you.

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:32.832
And that's not what your
mother would have want for you.

1:29:32.832 --> 1:29:37.588
So please think about whatever
it is that you are doing

1:29:37.588 --> 1:29:41.140
because God knows I can't take it

1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:43.557
if something happened to you.

1:29:44.788 --> 1:29:45.788
You hear me?

1:29:47.485 --> 1:29:48.700
- I got you, auntie.

1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:52.108
But you ain't gotta
worry about me, I'm good.

1:29:52.108 --> 1:29:54.525
- You make sure of that, boy.

1:29:55.408 --> 1:29:57.928
You make sure of that.

1:29:57.928 --> 1:29:58.845
I love you.

1:29:59.952 --> 1:30:00.824
- I love you too.

1:30:00.824 --> 1:30:01.916
- You hear me.

1:30:01.916 --> 1:30:02.908
I love you, baby.

1:30:02.908 --> 1:30:04.325
- I love you too.

1:30:06.714 --> 1:30:08.984
- Hey yo, stop fucking playing with me.

1:30:08.984 --> 1:30:10.724
Bitch, (indistinct) fucking around you.

1:30:10.724 --> 1:30:12.012
You still love that nigga bitch.

1:30:12.012 --> 1:30:14.095
- Get the fuck off of me.

1:30:25.763 --> 1:30:27.864
- Is this what you want, huh.

1:30:27.864 --> 1:30:28.781
Huh, bitch.

1:30:29.872 --> 1:30:31.732
It's my pussy.

1:30:31.732 --> 1:30:34.065
It's my motherfucking pussy.

1:30:45.476 --> 1:30:49.059
Now go wash your ass
up, you fucking bitch.

1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:56.263
(somber music)

1:31:01.676 --> 1:31:02.509
- Be okay.

1:31:04.134 --> 1:31:04.967
All right baby.

1:31:04.967 --> 1:31:05.800
Thank you.

1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:06.633
- You be good now.

1:31:06.633 --> 1:31:08.300
- You too, love you.

1:31:17.824 --> 1:31:19.991
- All right, love you too.

1:31:21.928 --> 1:31:22.761
- Yo, y'all laughing man.

1:31:22.761 --> 1:31:23.624
It's real shit.

Y'all niggas out here playing

1:31:24.508 --> 1:31:26.864
and this money you'll be getting.

1:31:26.864 --> 1:31:28.168
That's why y'all still
stuck in the same business

1:31:28.168 --> 1:31:29.418
y'all stuck in.

1:31:34.613 --> 1:31:35.446
- Shit.

1:31:45.583 --> 1:31:46.964
- Yo, where you at?

1:31:46.964 --> 1:31:49.436
- In the hood, what's up.

1:31:49.436 --> 1:31:50.548
How are we looking out there.

1:31:50.548 --> 1:31:53.156
- Sit, business as usual.

1:31:53.156 --> 1:31:54.372
- All right, I'ma pull up on you man.

1:31:54.372 --> 1:31:57.208
Hunt, man after I changed

1:32:19.853 --> 1:32:20.924

1:32:20.924 --> 1:32:23.116
- Where you coming from?

1:32:23.116 --> 1:32:25.216
- Talking to auntie.

1:32:25.216 --> 1:32:26.049
- Yeah.

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:28.888
How's she doing?

1:32:28.888 --> 1:32:31.904
- She good, one day at a time fam.

1:32:31.904 --> 1:32:32.737
- Damn.

1:32:33.644 --> 1:32:35.227
I can only imagine.

1:32:37.844 --> 1:32:39.417
- Want something to eat?

1:32:39.417 --> 1:32:40.667
- No, I'm good.

1:32:41.867 --> 1:32:43.117
Check this out.

1:32:43.984 --> 1:32:45.228
Little bro, April.

1:32:45.228 --> 1:32:47.309
Shortly I've been dealing
with since I've been home.

1:32:47.309 --> 1:32:49.383
- She in local real estate, bro, yeah.

1:32:49.383 --> 1:32:51.136
- Yeah while am at
shorty house last night,

1:32:51.136 --> 1:32:53.550
going through some photos,
I came across a picture

1:32:53.550 --> 1:32:54.967
of the boy Kevin.

1:32:56.088 --> 1:32:58.421
- Kevin, man the boy flying.

1:32:59.748 --> 1:33:01.036
You talking about the
nigga we rocked asleep

1:33:01.036 --> 1:33:02.764
back in the day.

1:33:02.764 --> 1:33:03.736
- That's her brother.

1:33:03.736 --> 1:33:06.676
- Man, get the fuck
outta here, you serious?

1:33:06.676 --> 1:33:07.509
- Bro.

1:33:12.888 --> 1:33:15.168
- How are you gonna play this one out?

1:33:15.168 --> 1:33:16.418
- I don't know.

1:34:25.549 --> 1:34:26.645
- Hey babe.

1:34:26.645 --> 1:34:27.573
- Hey baby, where you at work?

1:34:27.573 --> 1:34:29.490
- No, I'm at the house.

1:34:31.237 --> 1:34:32.437
- You're not going today?

1:34:32.437 --> 1:34:33.605
- I wasn't feeling too good.

1:34:33.605 --> 1:34:35.453
I think it's something I ate.

1:34:35.453 --> 1:34:36.605
- Do you need me to bring you something?

1:34:36.605 --> 1:34:37.777
You all right?

1:34:37.777 --> 1:34:38.901
- No, I'm good.

1:34:38.901 --> 1:34:40.474
I'm just gonna lay down
for a little while.

1:34:40.474 --> 1:34:42.981
I'll call you when I get up.

1:34:42.981 --> 1:34:43.814
All right.

1:34:58.553 --> 1:35:00.738
- Yo, how many more stops we got?

1:35:00.738 --> 1:35:02.585
- I just got to go around
the way and grab some money

1:35:02.585 --> 1:35:04.297
before we shoot to the forest.

1:35:04.297 --> 1:35:05.541
- What's in the forest.

1:35:05.541 --> 1:35:06.829
- Nah, I'm just trying to hit the outlet

1:35:06.829 --> 1:35:09.129
so I can grab something to wear.

1:35:09.129 --> 1:35:12.699
- All right, I'm gonna swing
by shorty house real quick

1:35:12.699 --> 1:35:13.583
and take her something to eat.

1:35:13.583 --> 1:35:15.295
She ain't filling too good.

1:35:15.295 --> 1:35:18.247
Plus I need to snatch something
from over there anyway.

1:35:18.247 --> 1:35:20.887
- Yo, this bitch got you gone.

1:35:20.887 --> 1:35:22.375
- That's how you feel.

1:35:22.375 --> 1:35:24.713
- That bitch got you wide open.

1:35:24.713 --> 1:35:26.227
That pussy that good nigga.

1:35:29.679 --> 1:35:31.147
- Hey yo, Hunt, fuck that.

1:35:31.147 --> 1:35:33.955
The majority's nigga

1:35:33.955 --> 1:35:35.587
with a bitch and I ain't
letting you go out like that,

1:35:35.587 --> 1:35:36.420

1:35:36.420 --> 1:35:37.253
- Go out like what, bro?

1:35:37.253 --> 1:35:39.127
- Yo, you gotta be smart.

1:35:39.127 --> 1:35:40.841
I mean, we kill this bitch brother.

1:35:40.841 --> 1:35:44.258
That shit too close to home, you feel me?

1:35:45.358 --> 1:35:49.191
- You know what, I might
do need to fall back.

1:35:50.966 --> 1:35:52.498
This could get out of hand.

1:35:52.498 --> 1:35:55.738
- Nigga, out of hand, this
shit already out of hand.

1:35:55.738 --> 1:35:58.286
Yo, I need you to get
your head out that pussy

1:35:58.286 --> 1:35:59.894

1:37:44.603 --> 1:37:47.270
(hip hop music)

1:37:58.299 --> 1:37:59.587
- Man, this fucking nigga.

1:37:59.587 --> 1:38:00.420
Are you fucking.

1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:02.107
I'm tired of this nigga, man.

1:38:02.107 --> 1:38:03.579
This needs his ass kicked.

1:38:03.579 --> 1:38:04.943
I'm tired of him thinking he can do

1:38:04.943 --> 1:38:06.323
whatever he wants to you.

1:38:06.323 --> 1:38:08.351
- It's all right Kim, it's all right.

1:38:08.351 --> 1:38:09.184
- No.

1:38:09.184 --> 1:38:11.219
- It's all right.

1:38:11.219 --> 1:38:12.052
- Bree, it's not all right.

1:38:12.052 --> 1:38:12.911
That nigga raped you.

1:38:12.911 --> 1:38:14.591
He not getting away with this.

1:38:14.591 --> 1:38:17.049
Man, I'm tired of that
nigga and his bullshit.

1:38:17.049 --> 1:38:18.715
- What you want me to do, Kim.

1:38:18.715 --> 1:38:20.803
- Call the fucking police.

1:38:20.803 --> 1:38:22.841
- You know I can't do that.

1:38:22.841 --> 1:38:24.843
Valentine got all types of connections.

1:38:24.843 --> 1:38:26.987
I don't have nobody to protect me.

1:38:26.987 --> 1:38:29.179
If I even threatened to go to the police,

1:38:29.179 --> 1:38:30.739
that nigga have me killed.

1:38:30.739 --> 1:38:33.079
Like just let it go, damn.

1:38:33.079 --> 1:38:34.996
- Let it go, let it go.

1:38:35.839 --> 1:38:37.338
I'm not letting shit go.

1:38:37.338 --> 1:38:39.388
I don't care how much money he has.

1:38:39.388 --> 1:38:41.703
What type of connections he's got,

1:38:41.703 --> 1:38:45.211
you can't let them get
away with abusing you.

1:38:45.211 --> 1:38:49.128
Yo Bree, if you don't
value yourself, who will?

1:38:50.251 --> 1:38:51.827
- Yo, I shouldn't have provoked the nigga

1:38:51.827 --> 1:38:53.103
in the first place.

1:38:53.103 --> 1:38:55.331
Kim, like I knew he was gonna flip out

1:38:55.331 --> 1:38:56.851
and act crazy like I should not.

1:38:56.851 --> 1:38:58.451
- No, Bree, I'm not
gonna let you sit up here

1:38:58.451 --> 1:38:59.771
and blame yourself.

1:38:59.771 --> 1:39:02.807
You're beautiful with so much potential.

1:39:02.807 --> 1:39:05.071
Bitch, I need you to recognize that.

1:39:05.071 --> 1:39:07.934
So what if you acknowledged
Hunter and gave him a hug.

1:39:07.934 --> 1:39:10.921
Man, that nigga ain't got no rights.

1:39:10.921 --> 1:39:12.838
- No rights what, what?

1:39:14.607 --> 1:39:18.723
- Bitch, what if you told
Hunter what that nigga did?

1:39:18.723 --> 1:39:20.851
- Yeah, Hunter is not gonna
do nothing to Valentine.

1:39:20.851 --> 1:39:22.891
Them niggas is like
brothers, you know that.

1:39:22.891 --> 1:39:23.987
- Exactly.

1:39:23.987 --> 1:39:27.887
- The disrespect, the disloyalty
of him sleeping with you

1:39:27.887 --> 1:39:31.667
when Hunter was in prison is
enough to make that nigga snap.

1:39:31.667 --> 1:39:34.515
And when he find out that
bitch ass nigga raped you,

1:39:34.515 --> 1:39:36.765
he gonn' flip the fuck out.

1:39:37.995 --> 1:39:39.123
- You think so?

1:39:39.123 --> 1:39:40.456
- Yo, I know so.

1:39:43.443 --> 1:39:45.659
- You know what, shit.

1:39:45.659 --> 1:39:47.131
Valentine was the one that was telling me

1:39:47.131 --> 1:39:48.884
that Hunter was cheating and shit

1:39:48.884 --> 1:39:51.555
with the bitches in the first place.

1:39:51.555 --> 1:39:52.515
- See, perfect.

1:39:52.515 --> 1:39:54.932
Use all that against his ass.

1:39:56.207 --> 1:39:58.023
- You know what, you're right.

1:39:58.023 --> 1:40:00.903
And then maybe Hunter will
understand the position

1:40:00.903 --> 1:40:04.487
that that nigga, Valentine
put me in in the first place.

1:40:04.487 --> 1:40:07.904
I really didn't think about it like that.

1:40:09.519 --> 1:40:12.602
(instrumental music)

1:40:17.347 --> 1:40:18.771
- What did I do now.

1:40:18.771 --> 1:40:20.148
- You didn't do anything.

1:40:20.148 --> 1:40:21.966
- So what we need to talk about?

1:40:21.966 --> 1:40:23.991
- Baby, we need to talk about us,

1:40:23.991 --> 1:40:26.389
the plans for our relationship.

1:40:26.389 --> 1:40:28.418
I can't just sit and wait on you

1:40:28.418 --> 1:40:30.143
to get your life together, baby.

1:40:30.143 --> 1:40:32.631
- Hey, we already talked about this.

1:40:32.631 --> 1:40:34.899
Ain't nothing to mention
them all right now.

1:40:34.899 --> 1:40:35.732
So don't do that.

1:40:35.732 --> 1:40:37.327
- Well, that's not working for me.

1:40:37.327 --> 1:40:41.139
I need stability and
you all over the place.

1:40:41.139 --> 1:40:42.440
- What do you want me to do?

1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:43.703
- I want you to make a choice.

1:40:43.703 --> 1:40:44.627
- Between what?

1:40:44.627 --> 1:40:48.307
- Oh, I need to spell it out for you.

1:40:48.307 --> 1:40:52.043
- Babe, I've been in the
streets working my ass off

1:40:52.043 --> 1:40:54.803
trying to get my life back together

1:40:54.803 --> 1:40:56.543
and you already know what
I've been going through.

1:40:56.543 --> 1:40:57.863
Everything that happened to Nick.

1:40:57.863 --> 1:40:59.603
- I don't wanna hear you say anything

1:40:59.603 --> 1:41:01.371
about what happened with Nick.

1:41:01.371 --> 1:41:03.771
You wanna keep using that shit
as an excuse to go back out

1:41:03.771 --> 1:41:06.351
into these streets with this stupid shit.

1:41:06.351 --> 1:41:07.959
Instead of standing up and being a man,

1:41:07.959 --> 1:41:09.590
you being a coward.

1:41:09.590 --> 1:41:10.423
- Coward.

1:41:10.423 --> 1:41:11.439
- Yes, a coward.

1:41:11.439 --> 1:41:12.503
- I ain't no motherfucking coward.

1:41:12.503 --> 1:41:13.539
- You are a fucking coward.

1:41:13.539 --> 1:41:15.981
You care so much about
what everybody else think.

1:41:15.981 --> 1:41:18.923
These streets don't give a fuck about you.

1:41:18.923 --> 1:41:22.006
- The streets, the people, the hustle

1:41:23.030 --> 1:41:24.351
is just who I am, baby.

1:41:24.351 --> 1:41:27.291
- So what about me, what about us?

1:41:27.291 --> 1:41:28.687
- What do you want me to do?

1:41:28.687 --> 1:41:29.691
- I can't do this.

1:41:29.691 --> 1:41:30.524
- You can't do what?

1:41:30.524 --> 1:41:31.956
- I can't do this.

1:41:31.956 --> 1:41:33.159
- You can't do what?

1:41:33.159 --> 1:41:35.076
- I'm pregnant, Hunter.

1:41:35.991 --> 1:41:37.074
I'm pregnant.

1:41:38.562 --> 1:41:40.312
Yeah, with your baby.

1:41:42.806 --> 1:41:46.842
And I'll be damned if I have
a child without a father.

1:41:46.842 --> 1:41:49.362
You're not doing this to me.

1:41:49.362 --> 1:41:50.195
- You sure?

1:41:50.195 --> 1:41:51.445
- I'm positive.

1:41:53.199 --> 1:41:57.032
That's why you need to
get your shit together.

1:41:58.150 --> 1:42:01.405
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

1:42:01.405 --> 1:42:02.814
I'm not playing, babe.

1:42:02.814 --> 1:42:04.070
- Come here, come here.

1:42:04.070 --> 1:42:06.086
- You can't do this to me.

1:42:06.086 --> 1:42:08.086
You can't do this to me.

1:42:12.907 --> 1:42:15.574
- Hold on, let me call you back.

1:42:17.126 --> 1:42:18.190
Hey yo, so what's up.

1:42:18.190 --> 1:42:19.583
What's the fucking plan?

1:42:19.583 --> 1:42:21.610
- Man, that that bitch
ass nigga, Valentine.

1:42:21.610 --> 1:42:23.610
Man, this raped my girl.

1:42:24.515 --> 1:42:25.418
Your girl, who?

1:42:25.418 --> 1:42:26.251

1:42:27.970 --> 1:42:29.258
- What you mean he raped her.

1:42:29.258 --> 1:42:30.982
I thought they was fucking

1:42:30.982 --> 1:42:31.898

But this nigga, this nigga

which happened to be his
right-hand man, Hunter.

1:42:42.262 --> 1:42:44.709
- That was his man's girl.

1:42:44.709 --> 1:42:47.470
So basically he took the
pussy on some dominating

1:42:47.470 --> 1:42:48.578

1:42:48.578 --> 1:42:49.411

1:42:49.411 --> 1:42:53.034
'Cause you know Bri and
Bri still love this nigga.

1:42:53.034 --> 1:42:54.218

1:44:15.818 --> 1:44:17.078
- I'll do a shot with you.

1:44:17.078 --> 1:44:17.911
- Okay.

1:44:20.226 --> 1:44:22.282
- So what's up, what you wanna talk about?

1:44:22.282 --> 1:44:25.615
- Well, like I never stopped loving you.

1:44:30.846 --> 1:44:34.190
Like first of all, let
me just say that, okay.

1:44:34.190 --> 1:44:37.357
But after you got locked up and went away,

1:44:37.357 --> 1:44:39.607
I felt confused and lonely.

1:44:41.616 --> 1:44:43.970
- Bree, we already traveled this road.

1:44:43.970 --> 1:44:45.398
We ain't gotta even go there again.

1:44:45.398 --> 1:44:46.550
We good.

1:44:46.550 --> 1:44:50.217
- I know, but I feel
like I need to tell you

1:44:51.550 --> 1:44:54.067
the reason why I did what I did.

1:44:54.067 --> 1:44:55.046
- Okay.

1:44:55.046 --> 1:44:56.470
- But I need you to promise me

1:44:56.470 --> 1:44:59.110
that you're not gon to
flip out and act crazy.

1:44:59.110 --> 1:45:01.674
- Say what you got to say, Bree.

1:45:01.674 --> 1:45:02.507
- Okay.

1:45:06.474 --> 1:45:10.166
Well, when you first got
locked up and went away,

1:45:10.166 --> 1:45:13.134
your man Valentine, he would, you know,

1:45:13.134 --> 1:45:17.670
he would come by, give me
money, make sure I was okay.

1:45:17.670 --> 1:45:19.154
- Okay, that's what he's supposed to do.

1:45:19.154 --> 1:45:20.622
- I know, right.

1:45:20.622 --> 1:45:23.294
But he started to come over
maybe a little bit more

1:45:23.294 --> 1:45:24.718
than he should have.

1:45:24.718 --> 1:45:27.870
- What do you mean more
than he should have?

1:45:27.870 --> 1:45:31.787
- Well, he would pop up
late night unannounced,

1:45:34.662 --> 1:45:39.014
telling me how beautiful I
was, how I deserved better.

1:45:39.014 --> 1:45:42.662
And at first I won't entertain it,

1:45:42.662 --> 1:45:45.119
but he started to tell
me about all the bitches

1:45:45.119 --> 1:45:47.286
that you was fucking with.

1:45:48.182 --> 1:45:52.646
And at that point I felt
lonely and betrayed and shit,

1:45:52.646 --> 1:45:56.018
I thought he was just trying to help me.

1:45:56.018 --> 1:45:58.586
- So if you're tryina
tell me that you and V

1:45:58.586 --> 1:46:02.006
was out here around while I was locked up.

1:46:02.006 --> 1:46:04.810
- Listen, Hunter, listen.

1:46:04.810 --> 1:46:06.430
I know that this sound...

1:46:06.430 --> 1:46:09.686
- Yo, you this nigga while
I'm fighting for my freedom.

1:46:09.686 --> 1:46:10.766
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

1:46:10.766 --> 1:46:12.730
- Listen Hunter, I'm so sorry.

1:46:12.730 --> 1:46:15.158
- Sorry, bitch, I should
kick your motherfucking ass.

1:46:15.158 --> 1:46:17.857
Everything I did for you,
I sacrificed for you.

1:46:17.857 --> 1:46:19.056
- It wasn't about you, what about me?

1:46:19.056 --> 1:46:19.889
- What about you?

1:46:19.889 --> 1:46:21.518
You left me out here.

1:46:21.518 --> 1:46:24.351
- Yo, that nigga raped me, Hunter.

1:46:28.706 --> 1:46:30.222
- No, no, don't even sound right.

1:46:30.222 --> 1:46:32.546
- He raped me, Hunter.

1:46:32.546 --> 1:46:33.446
- That don't even sound right.

1:46:33.446 --> 1:46:35.486
V wouldn't do that.

1:46:35.486 --> 1:46:38.458
- Yo, he raped me, he came to my house.

1:46:38.458 --> 1:46:41.050
He know I still love you.

1:46:41.050 --> 1:46:44.698
Yo, he is jealous of you
and he always has been.

1:46:44.698 --> 1:46:47.862
- If I find like you
fucking with me, you lying.

1:46:47.862 --> 1:46:49.449
- Yo, why would I lie?

1:46:49.449 --> 1:46:51.566
Why the fuck would I lie?

1:46:51.566 --> 1:46:53.444
- This would get real fucking ugly man.

1:46:53.444 --> 1:46:55.502

- Fuck off.

1:46:57.810 --> 1:47:00.030
- Please, please don't leave, wait.

1:47:00.030 --> 1:47:03.267
- Yo, I really appreciate
you handling that for me.

1:47:03.267 --> 1:47:04.742
That takes a load off of me.

1:47:04.742 --> 1:47:07.108
- I'm glad everything
worked out the way it did.

1:47:07.108 --> 1:47:09.554
If you have any more
questions, just give me a call.

1:47:09.554 --> 1:47:10.387
- I'll do that.

1:47:10.387 --> 1:47:11.942
I'll be in touch.

1:47:11.942 --> 1:47:13.274
- All right, man stay in touch.

- You sure, you don't look good.

1:47:28.127 --> 1:47:31.067
- How long have we known each other, V?

1:47:31.067 --> 1:47:33.375
- Man, it been too long, I can't remember.

1:47:33.375 --> 1:47:34.306
Why.

1:47:34.306 --> 1:47:35.223
- 20 years.

1:47:36.324 --> 1:47:39.791
20 years of blood, sweat and tears.

1:47:39.791 --> 1:47:43.543
I never lied to you, I
never stole from you.

1:47:43.543 --> 1:47:47.863
I never did nothing to
compromise our relationship.

1:47:47.863 --> 1:47:49.375
- Facts, you've kept a
solid all the way through.

1:47:49.375 --> 1:47:50.923
What's this about?

1:47:50.923 --> 1:47:52.735
- Trying to figure out why
would you compromise what we had

1:47:52.735 --> 1:47:54.985
over a piece of pussy, bro.

1:47:56.307 --> 1:47:58.167
- Man, what that bitch tell you, man?

1:47:58.167 --> 1:47:59.647
- You know what she told me.

I'm just trying to figure out why.

1:48:04.415 --> 1:48:05.827
