00:25.192 --> 00:27.903
Hugo,
do you know what day February 2nd is?

00:28.654 --> 00:30.155
Sure. It's Groundhog Day.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.823
Groundhog Day?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.450
Groundhog Day?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.244
Joe, stop the car.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.787
No, I'm not stopping the car.

00:36.787 --> 00:41.124
Okay. In Mexico,
February 2nd is <i>el Día de la Candelaria</i>.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.044
And it is way better than Groundhog Day.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.712
Because on our day,

00:45.796 --> 00:47.381
whoever got the Baby Jesus

00:47.381 --> 00:50.717
in their piece of the Rosca de Reyes cake
on Three Kings Day,

00:51.343 --> 00:53.345
brings tamales for everyone.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.472
Yeah, that kind of sounds complicated.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.891
Yeah, that sounds way too complicated.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.352
Plus, groundhogs are cute.
-Groundhogs are lame.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.312
Mexico wins. End of discussion.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.441
Anyway, in January of 1985,
I found the baby.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.693
So, on February 2nd,

01:07.693 --> 01:10.612
I was bringing tamales
for everyone at work.

01:10.696 --> 01:11.738
And that month

01:12.656 --> 01:14.449
that month had been a busy one.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.911
<i>Memo was finally working at the pool
with me.</i>

01:18.537 --> 01:20.122
<i>We made a great team.</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:23.250
The towels need to be rolled.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.086
<i>And best of all, Memo made work more fun.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:28.338
<i>Even dealing with Héctor.</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:34.386
<i>I'd also started the job
Don Pablo gave me to get closer to Diane.</i>

01:35.846 --> 01:38.432
<i>At home, I was still dating Roberta.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:41.351
<i>Or so my mom thought.</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:44.188
<i>Meanwhile, that girl, Isabel,</i>

01:44.188 --> 01:46.732
<i>kept bringing posole into the resort...</i>

01:48.567 --> 01:50.402
<i>and taking other things out.</i>

01:50.402 --> 01:52.279
So, what'd you steal today?

01:52.321 --> 01:54.698
A saltshaker, a tiny act of defiance.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.783
<i>It became our routine.</i>

01:56.867 --> 01:59.203
<i>Every time I saw her,
I'd ask what she stole.</i>

01:59.203 --> 02:00.829
Héctor's hair spray?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.539
Now you're playing with fire.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.166
What can I say?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.835
I live on the edge.
-Where is it?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.338
I'm losing volume.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.592
Anyway, it was finally February 2nd,

02:13.592 --> 02:18.138
and everyone was excited
because it was not Groundhog Day.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.642
<i>But I had other things on my mind.</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:23.227
URGENT
SETTLE OUTSTANDING BALANCE

02:23.227 --> 02:27.272
<i>Remember, last Christmas,
my mother got her eye surgery.</i>

02:27.356 --> 02:28.524
Thank you so much, Doctor.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.276
My job is going to promote me this week.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.570
I promise to pay it off by March.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.990
Okay, but if you don't finish paying
in the next three months,

02:37.032 --> 02:38.909
I'll put her cataracts back in.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.412
It's only a joke.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.164
We'll just seize all your belongings.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.626
<i>But I did not get that promotion.</i>

02:47.626 --> 02:52.047
<i>In fact, I was making less money
after my deal with Héctor.</i>

02:52.589 --> 02:54.508
<i>My family had no idea,</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:57.302
<i>but we were on the brink of disaster.</i>

02:58.470 --> 03:00.722
We just got another notice

03:00.764 --> 03:02.891
about the money we owe
for my mom's surgery.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.768
We're in real trouble.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.312
But it's okay,
I'll just have to push myself.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.564
There's always a way.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.858
Of course there's always a way!

03:10.899 --> 03:13.151
You're Máximo Gallardo.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.446
Thanks for reminding me of my name.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.701
Ooh, can you also remind me
to pick up the tamales at lunch?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.286
My mom's making them right now.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.580
Of course!

03:24.621 --> 03:26.582
I can't wait for the tamale party.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.170
I barely see Lorena anymore since
I stopped working in the laundry room.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.421
Lupe won't let you in there, huh?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.548
Her exact words were,

03:35.174 --> 03:39.136
"Set one foot in this room
and I'll cut it off."

03:39.678 --> 03:41.847
I'm hoping she meant my foot,

03:42.139 --> 03:44.725
but that's not where she was pointing.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.316
Is that Fabián Solares? The gossip guy?

03:52.357 --> 03:53.650
From <i>Espectacular</i>?

03:53.692 --> 03:56.445
Yeah, it is. My mom watches him every day.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.280
No, no, don't look at him.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.115
Yeah, I don't want to get into trouble.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.950
Hello, my handsome friends!

04:02.117 --> 04:06.872
I hear you might have a certain famous
tennis player staying with you.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.041
Any info you can give me?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.375
Sorry, I don't know anything.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.044
Well, can I ask for your names?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.045
We don't have names!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.339
Come on, Máximo.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.143
We'll need six more
of your dresses with the shoulder pads,

04:28.227 --> 04:30.145
but quadruple the size of the pads.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.980
Isn't that too much?

04:32.064 --> 04:34.399
I want a plane
to be able to land on these shoulders.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.567
Hey, Julia.

04:35.651 --> 04:36.777
I figured it out. Okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.863
You remember the guy at the Olympics
who flew in on the jet pack?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.407
That's how I want us to enter our wedding.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.078
Your wedding plans
are chugging right along.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.623
I am so... to hear that.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.627
I could not be more... for you.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.546
And I mean every word.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.339
We're thinking about December.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.924
This December?

04:58.924 --> 05:01.677
She really wants to lock you in
before you change your mind, huh?

05:01.677 --> 05:03.720
Well, it was actually my idea.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.765
He really wants to lock you in
before you change your mind, huh?

05:06.849 --> 05:10.352
We can get it organized on time.
It's just a small wedding, Diane.

05:10.853 --> 05:14.398
Small. So smart. Fewer gifts to return
if it doesn't work out, right?

05:15.274 --> 05:16.692
I'm kidding, of course!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.444
Don't forget. Shoulder pads.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.159
Máximo.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.495
Are you a tennis fan?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.455
Not really.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.500
Are you asking
because you are getting me a present?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.127
I've always wanted a motorbike.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.880
I'm creating an opportunity for you.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.341
When you give Diane
her coffee and paper today,

05:41.884 --> 05:43.177
be a tennis fan.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.310
Also, I believe your friend has arrived

05:51.310 --> 05:54.104
for his exhibition match
against his tennis rival.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.441
A world-class player
should get world-class service.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.402
Maybe he should have a personal liaison.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.114
I can do it. I'm a tennis fan.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.241
Oh, really?

06:06.325 --> 06:09.536
The biggest. I love drop shots,
the Eastern forehand grip.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.707
I'm so glad Walter Wingfield developed
the modern version of the game in 1873.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.543
Great.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.421
And maybe don't talk too much
about tennis.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.672
You got it.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.884
<i>If I help a star tennis player,</i>

06:23.884 --> 06:26.803
<i>I might just get the tips
that we needed to survive.</i>

06:27.471 --> 06:30.140
Here we go. Héctor's Nectar.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.310
I think those shorts
stayed in the drier too long.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.229
Any smaller
and I get to meet "Héctorcito."

06:36.230 --> 06:37.314
Making fun of the boss.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.149
Love that, hey? Love.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.152
Now, listen.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.112
A very, very, very special guest

06:44.196 --> 06:47.366
with a very, very, very, very,
very big wallet

06:47.366 --> 06:50.244
has requested her favorite chair today.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.830
So, I need you to keep it free
till she shows up.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.875
Can't we use our reserve sign?
-Those never work.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.545
Our guests from the US
always plop down on top of them.

06:59.545 --> 07:03.257
So, I need you to sit right on this chair.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.261
So, my job is to sit here?

07:07.886 --> 07:09.555
You got it.
-On this chair.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.431
That's right.
-Just sit?

07:11.515 --> 07:12.933
Correct.
-Right there?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.226
Bingo.
-That's all?

07:14.768 --> 07:15.811
That's all.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.272
I do what?
-You sit.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.356
I sit where?
-On this chair.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.649
Besides that.
-Not a thing.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.192
Okay, I sit here.
-Yes, again.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.402
On this chair.
-Are we on a loop?

07:23.402 --> 07:24.945
One more time--
-Just sit down!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.029
Okay.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.784
This is important. Do you understand?

07:31.535 --> 07:33.787
I better not see you
standing up on the job.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.675
Wow.
-Hey. Hi.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.594
No pictures, please.
-Sorry.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.970
Come on. I'm kidding.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.766
Hi! I'm Máximo.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.894
Diane assigned me to be here
for anything you need.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.478
Sweet! All right.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.607
Now, I'm gonna work you,
but there's a big tip waiting for you.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.524
Okay?

08:02.608 --> 08:05.277
First thing,
I need a pool cabana set up with a TV

08:05.277 --> 08:06.945
and the video game system I brought.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.363
It's in the bag on my couch.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.365
Right away. I'm happy to serve you.

08:10.949 --> 08:11.992
Serve.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.493
Tennis pun. Good one.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.662
Right! That's what I was going for.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.331
Any messages?

08:17.331 --> 08:20.334
Aaron Azzaro, but I know you knew that.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.295
Not at the moment, Mr. Azzaro.
But I'll be sure to let you know.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.172
You do that, sweetie.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.342
God, what a jackass.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.928
Nice front desk voice.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.763
I don't know what you mean, ma'am.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.113
Sara.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.698
What are you doing here?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.367
You said you were going to the butcher.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.661
What's going on with you two?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.334
Máximo broke up with Roberta this morning.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.128
The poor girl kept crying,
so I was comforting her.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.297
I know you think he's an angel,

09:07.339 --> 09:09.299
but there is a side to him you don't know

09:09.341 --> 09:10.843
he cheated on her with a red-haired girl...

09:10.884 --> 09:13.220
who's very, very tall...

09:13.262 --> 09:14.096
Her name is...

09:17.349 --> 09:18.433
"Skye."

09:19.685 --> 09:20.686
My Máximo?!

09:28.986 --> 09:32.197
<i>I was on my way to meet Aaron
with his video game, when--</i>

09:32.281 --> 09:33.448
Máximo.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.535
This is my friend I was telling you about.

09:37.578 --> 09:41.081
Your friend, the star tennis player?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.541
Jann Berglund himself.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.543
The Striking Viking.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.961
The Speedy Swedey.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.713
I don't care for those nicknames.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.464
Please don't use those nicknames, Máximo.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.550
Máximo here will take great care of you

09:51.550 --> 09:54.469
and get you all ready
for your match tomorrow with Aaron Azzaro.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.305
I'll see you at dinner.

09:58.265 --> 10:03.103
So, Diane tells me
you will be devoted just to me. Correct?

10:03.604 --> 10:07.524
<i>Suddenly, I had a chance
to make twice as much money for my family.</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:11.195
<i>But what was I supposed to do?
Be in two places at once?</i>

10:11.862 --> 10:12.863
I'm all yours.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.615
<i>There's always a way.</i>

10:14.615 --> 10:16.950
Good. Meet me in the gym in five minutes.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.952
Okay. Not a problem.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.913
I'm happy to serve you.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.498
Like tennis.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.083
Serve?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.544
Okay. See you there.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.567
Hey! It's on!

10:50.651 --> 10:54.404
All right. Check out my new game.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.948
Look, dude, it's me.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.077
Wow, I feel like I'm courtside
at the Wimble-- man.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.745
Come on. Let's play two-player.

11:03.288 --> 11:07.000
The graphics are great.
They just nailed the hair.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.672
Oh, no! The power mysteriously went out!

11:11.672 --> 11:12.923
I'll go check.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.600
Okay, let's pump some iron.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.687
This music. It's too slow.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.564
This is barley-growing music.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.358
Our musicians just got here,
so I'll go have them change it.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.921
Oh, good, the power's back on!
Thanks, guys!

11:53.005 --> 11:54.631
Finally! Let's do this.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.718
Yes! Right after I refill your drink.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.553
Gotta hydrate for tomorrow's match.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.020
This music is better. I feel energized.

12:08.812 --> 12:09.813
Spot me for ten.

12:11.023 --> 12:16.111
Or maybe we can see if you can hold
this weight up for two minutes?

12:16.195 --> 12:18.113
Is that a new kind of training?

12:18.197 --> 12:20.616
Yes. Very cutting-edge.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.826
Ready? And...

12:39.009 --> 12:41.094
Here you go.
-Oh, thanks!

12:41.178 --> 12:43.639
Okay, now sit your butt down
and get your ass kicked.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.350
Oh, whoops! That's mine.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.060
Yeah, let's just play.

12:55.901 --> 12:56.985
How much longer?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.572
You're right. Better not to know.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.581
<i>"Bodacious."</i>
-In your face.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.750
In my face.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.627
Whoa! Do not touch the hair.

13:13.627 --> 13:18.549
Got it. You should go back to one-player
while I re-refill your lemonade.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.472
Nice job!

13:28.725 --> 13:30.185
You know what?

13:30.269 --> 13:32.437
I was starting to think I couldn't do it.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.232
But you were right. You're a good trainer.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.527
Hey. You did the work.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.612
I didn't even need to be here.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.657
Water?

13:45.826 --> 13:48.287
Can you believe your mom
doesn't want us to get married?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.955
What are we gonna do about that?

13:49.955 --> 13:51.665
Well, you know, keep in mind, okay,

13:51.665 --> 13:55.169
she is a single mother,
and her only child is getting married.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.420
That's a big deal.

13:56.962 --> 14:00.048
We need to be patient and sympathetic
with her emotions,

14:00.132 --> 14:02.759
and over time, she will come around.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.428
Promise.
-You don't wanna confront her.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.512
Scared to death.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.766
Okay.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.728
Aaron's reviewing match tapes,
and Jann's at lunch,

14:12.728 --> 14:14.438
so I can finally take a break.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.482
Lucky. I haven't had a break all day.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.693
What?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.778
Sitting in the sun all day is tiring.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.906
How are you gonna keep this up?

14:23.906 --> 14:27.034
If they find out you've been working
for both of them, it's going to be bad.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.661
It's gonna be worse
if I don't pay off these debts.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.497
I have to do this.
I just need a little rest.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.959
You asked me to remind you about--
-The tamales! I forgot the tamales.

14:36.502 --> 14:39.671
While you're up, can you get me a--
Okay, never mind.

14:39.755 --> 14:42.424
Are the tamales ready, Mom?

14:43.217 --> 14:45.928
Sorry, I'm in a hurry--

14:48.096 --> 14:49.431
Um... hi, everyone.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.101
Roberta! How are you, my love?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.437
How is she?!

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
Her heart is broken!

14:57.314 --> 14:59.358
It is?
-Oh, my God, Máximo!

14:59.650 --> 15:03.570
You act like you didn't just
break up with her this morning.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.573
And that's why Mom
saw me comforting her in town.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.201
Yes...

15:09.243 --> 15:11.662
That's right... I did that.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.621
Thank you...

15:12.829 --> 15:16.083
Listen to him, it's like he's proud of it!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.918
Unbelievable.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.169
So who is this Skye?

15:20.087 --> 15:23.173
Skye is... a girl?

15:23.215 --> 15:26.593
A girl you've been secretly seeing
behind my back!

15:26.677 --> 15:28.637
I can't believe it.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.347
Oh, right. Skye. Yes.

15:30.889 --> 15:31.765
My secret girlfriend.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.892
Well, he said it.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.769
In case there was any doubt before,

15:35.811 --> 15:37.271
Skye is real.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.272
Here-

15:38.313 --> 15:39.648
...Because you're crying.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.235
Máximo.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.070
How could you have done such a thing?

15:45.696 --> 15:46.905
It's not clear to me either.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.199
I'll explain everything later... Maybe.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.536
Sorry, Roberta. Thanks, Mom!

15:55.664 --> 15:57.666
Men.
-Why even bother with them?

16:00.669 --> 16:03.422
<i>The Roberta fiasco made me late,
but I was hopeful</i>

16:03.422 --> 16:06.466
<i>I could still get back to Aaron and Jann
before anything bad could--</i>

16:06.550 --> 16:10.304
So why don't you and your stupid hair
find a different hotel?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.097
Stupid? Joke's on you.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.725
<i>Sports Illustrated</i>
said I look like a bird of prey.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.977
<i>Okay, this was bad.</i>

16:16.977 --> 16:19.521
<i>But as long as they didn't both see me,
I could--</i>

16:20.981 --> 16:23.400
Tell him he has to leave.
-Help me get rid of this guy!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.485
<i>Nope. This was gonna be tough.</i>

16:25.986 --> 16:28.113
Don't worry. I got your back.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.573
Get out of here, you.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.784
Wait. Which one of us are you talking to?

16:32.868 --> 16:34.995
I think it's pretty clear
whose side I'm on.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.956
So the other one, go on. Hit the road.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.375
Wait. Whose side are you on?

16:42.794 --> 16:44.671
Well--
-Gentlemen.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.008
Surely any differences you have

16:48.008 --> 16:50.427
could be settled on the court tomorrow.

16:50.511 --> 16:51.595
No?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.225
Máximo.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.019
What's happening here?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.063
I'm sorry. I got confused.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.398
I met Aaron first, then Jann.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.901
I really need the money.
I served them both.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.403
But I was cheating on them.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.614
Just like I cheated on
my pretend-girlfriend Roberta

17:10.696 --> 17:12.199
with my other pretend-girlfriend...

17:13.116 --> 17:14.117
Skye.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.119
Don't you know the saying of

17:17.204 --> 17:19.330
"the dog with two sandwiches"?

17:19.414 --> 17:22.334
You try too hard to have everything,
you end up with nothing.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.670
You are lucky your story
won't end the same way.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.756
Since you committed to Aaron first,

17:27.756 --> 17:30.551
I'll find someone else
to take care of Jann.

17:31.635 --> 17:35.097
Impressing Diane
will have to wait for another day.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.934
<i>And so would that second big tip.</i>

17:43.355 --> 17:44.940
Hi, Diane. May I?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.024
Sure.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.820
Chad and I
just wanted to thank you so much

17:49.820 --> 17:51.488
for helping us plan our wedding.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.323
Well, of course.

17:53.407 --> 17:57.202
Unfortunately, at this time,
we feel we need to make our own decisions.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.912
We appreciate your understanding.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.497
Hold on.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.333
Are you using
your front desk voice with me?

18:03.417 --> 18:07.004
Again, your satisfaction is
incredibly important to Chad and me.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.756
You don't know who you're messing with.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.342
I spent 20 years in Hollywood.
I can play this game.

18:14.303 --> 18:15.721
And I agree.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.890
You two should make your own decisions.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.517
I hope one day
you'll be mature enough to do so.

18:20.601 --> 18:21.935
Well, as you may know,

18:22.019 --> 18:24.563
wisdom doesn't necessarily come
with age, Diane.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.276
You'd be foolish not to listen
to someone who's been married three times.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.278
We're actually hoping to get it right
the first time.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.530
Too late. Who gets married in December?

18:33.614 --> 18:36.116
You're competing with Baby Jesus.
-Good news then!

18:36.200 --> 18:38.160
We just moved our wedding up to June.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.494
What?

18:41.371 --> 18:45.709
I don't know why, but you've
never liked that I'm dating your son.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.672
Okay. Well, honestly, no.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.925
But it has nothing to do with you.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.552
Obviously, I like you.
We're business partners.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.722
You two are just at different places
in your lives.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.641
You're not the right people
for each other.

19:00.641 --> 19:02.184
Well, you can't know that.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.727
I can't?

19:03.727 --> 19:08.524
Tell me,
is Chad really the love of your life?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.488
Yes, he is.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.241
And we're getting married. In June.

19:17.908 --> 19:23.413
And we would really appreciate it if you
can just be happy for us and on board.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.041
Please.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.046
Okay. Maybe I went too far. I'm sorry.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.549
I need to let you make your own decisions.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.843
And I do hope
you're right about you and Chad.

19:35.843 --> 19:39.304
Trust me, I want nothing more
than for the two of you to be happy.

19:39.888 --> 19:40.889
Thank you.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.024
And I told him,
"Not today, but maybe tomorrow."

19:51.108 --> 19:53.735
Hey, Adriana. Looking good.

19:53.819 --> 19:56.113
I think Pam Dawber has that outfit.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.448
It's hard to remember.
We've hung out a bunch.

19:58.532 --> 20:01.201
Anyway, I got something for you.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.662
Just thought you would like it.

20:03.662 --> 20:04.955
Cool. Thanks.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.165
So I was thinking maybe Saturday--
-Yeah, And I--

20:07.249 --> 20:08.333
Yeah, that went well.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.713
So you talked to her
and you convinced her?

20:13.714 --> 20:15.549
I wish I would've had you around
when I was 15.

20:15.549 --> 20:18.468
I could've got that cool tattoo
with dolphins crisscrossing.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.470
Yeah, I'm with your mom on that one.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.057
Isabel! Want some tamales? How are you?

20:25.559 --> 20:27.144
Thanks, but I can't stay.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.478
I'm just making my delivery

20:28.562 --> 20:30.772
and thought I'd say hi to Máximo
if he was around.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.734
Well, I-- I haven't seen him,

20:33.734 --> 20:36.653
but it's weird 'cause he's the one
who brought us the tamales.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.615
So, what's Máximo's deal?

20:40.407 --> 20:41.700
I think he's Mexican.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.662
No, I mean what do you think of him?

20:47.456 --> 20:48.999
We love Máximo.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.876
Yeah.
-Are you thinking about asking him out?

20:50.876 --> 20:52.920
Maybe. Julia?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.799
You should.

20:57.883 --> 21:00.886
She should, babe. You should.
You'd be really cute together.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.181
Okay, maybe I will. I'll keep you posted.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.140
Okay.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.602
Some of these
just aren't as full as the other ones.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.318
Hey!
-Hey.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.320
I didn't want you to miss out.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.364
Oh, thank you! That's so sweet!

21:20.739 --> 21:22.616
That guest still hasn't come?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.410
You've sat here the entire day.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.329
It's like some sort of torture.

21:30.666 --> 21:31.959
Oh, my God.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.253
The guest does not exist!

21:34.294 --> 21:36.588
This morning
I made fun of Héctor's shorts,

21:36.630 --> 21:39.341
so as payback,
he made me sit here all day in the sun.

21:39.383 --> 21:40.926
It is torture!

21:41.718 --> 21:43.971
That short shorts-wearing bastard.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.976
Well, at least I'm free now.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.770
Come on, let's get back to that party.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.188
After a quick bathroom stop.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.773
Maybe not so quick,

21:54.815 --> 21:56.358
I drank eight glasses of water.

21:57.192 --> 22:00.988
Wow, how could I have fallen for his lie
about the big tip?

22:03.282 --> 22:06.285
Right this way, please.
Here we go. Watch your step.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.120
Where did he...

22:08.704 --> 22:09.705
Oh, well.

22:09.705 --> 22:12.124
Here you go, Miss Leonora.
-Thank you, Héctor.

22:12.124 --> 22:14.626
You know you don't have to, but thank you.

22:14.710 --> 22:17.504
I'll be right back
with a couple of mango margaritas.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.723
Okay. So, obviously,
we need to be even more careful.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.892
Here's what I'm thinking--
-Sara.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.935
I'll tell my mom
I'm volunteering at the library,

22:31.977 --> 22:34.271
and she'll never go check
'cause she hates being quiet.

22:34.563 --> 22:35.522
Sara...

22:35.689 --> 22:36.982
What?

22:39.067 --> 22:40.861
I can't do this anymore.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.447
It's too much.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.241
All the lying and sneaking around...

22:46.950 --> 22:51.038
My parents are getting suspicious too,
and they...

22:53.832 --> 22:56.460
I just can't risk them finding out.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.173
Are you breaking up with me?

23:02.925 --> 23:04.218
I don't want to.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.969
Then don't!

23:08.055 --> 23:09.848
We have to stop seeing each other
for a while.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.963
Okay! That's everything you asked for.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.464
Is there anything else you need?

23:43.382 --> 23:46.218
No. That's it for today. Thanks. Hey.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.678
Are you ready for your tip?

23:48.220 --> 23:50.389
You deserve it. You've earned it.
-Yes, sir.

23:50.389 --> 23:51.932
Okay.

23:51.932 --> 23:57.396
Now, the key to anticipating
your opponent's next move

23:57.396 --> 24:00.816
is to watch their eyes
during their backswing.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.904
Okay.
-Awesome. Thanks again, buddy.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.240
So, my tip?

24:10.826 --> 24:12.077
Yeah, that was it.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.204
People pay me thousands
for that kind of advice.

24:14.788 --> 24:18.166
As great as that was,
I was really hoping for some actual money.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.545
Wow. Not enough for you, huh?

24:22.171 --> 24:23.213
You people.

24:26.091 --> 24:29.011
Here you go. Five bucks.
I bet that's worth a lot down here. Right?

24:29.011 --> 24:32.848
<i>No, that's not fair.
You worked your ass off for that jerk.</i>

24:32.848 --> 24:35.726
<i>Even worse, I needed that money.</i>

24:35.726 --> 24:40.022
<i>My family was on the edge.
We were at risk of losing everything.</i>

24:41.607 --> 24:42.608
<i>But then...</i>

24:44.109 --> 24:45.527
<i>I remembered.</i>

24:49.364 --> 24:52.910
The graphics are great.
They just nailed the hair.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.037
<i>If you really stretch yourself...</i>

24:55.037 --> 24:57.289
Whoops. That's mine.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.082
Do not touch

24:59.666 --> 25:01.502
the hair.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.129
<i>...there's always a way.</i>

25:09.968 --> 25:13.514
<i>The trick was
I had to stretch not what I could do,</i>

25:13.514 --> 25:15.182
<i>but what I was willing to do.</i>

25:20.187 --> 25:21.730
<i>"Espectacular!"</i>

25:23.607 --> 25:25.776
<i>We escaped the guards</i>

25:25.817 --> 25:27.152
<i>and we were able to get into Las Colinas.</i>

25:27.236 --> 25:30.072
<i>Aaron Azzaro
will be coming out any moment.</i>

25:30.697 --> 25:31.532
<i>There he is!</i>

25:31.532 --> 25:32.616
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:32.616 --> 25:34.451
<i>Aaron Azzaro.</i>

25:34.535 --> 25:36.828
<i>Sources tell us
that this isn't your real hair.</i>

25:36.912 --> 25:37.913
<i>Any comment?</i>

25:37.913 --> 25:39.998
<i>What? That's-- That's-- That's a lie.</i>

25:40.082 --> 25:42.668
<i>That's a hundred percent--
You know, it's--</i>

25:42.668 --> 25:45.087
<i>Go-- This isn't what it looks like! Okay?</i>

25:46.171 --> 25:47.548
<i>And that evening,</i>

25:47.548 --> 25:50.968
<i>I told my family
we would finally pay off our debts.</i>

25:51.802 --> 25:53.387
<i>For at least one night,</i>

25:53.387 --> 25:56.807
<i>we got to forget all our problems
and celebrate.</i>

26:00.644 --> 26:03.647
Yes! You got the money
and you got revenge.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.023
You won.

26:05.107 --> 26:07.150
No, Hugo. I lost.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.571
I had crossed a line
that I shouldn't have.

26:10.571 --> 26:12.906
<i>And soon, my deal with Fabián</i>

26:12.990 --> 26:17.578
<i>would come back to haunt me
in ways that I never could have imagined.</i>

26:17.578 --> 26:21.206
A dark time in my life was approaching.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.542
Oh, boy. Time for lunch.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.627
Come on.
-Joe, it's my treat.

26:26.503 --> 26:27.838
Yeah, no shit.

26:27.838 --> 26:29.673
<i>Anyway, that night,</i>

26:29.673 --> 26:32.342
<i>I had a feeling
that I just couldn't shake.</i>

26:37.347 --> 26:39.349
<i>Who was I becoming, Hugo?</i>

26:40.767 --> 26:43.979
<i>How could I still be proud
to be Máximo Gallardo?</i>

26:45.272 --> 26:48.942
<i>It would be a long time
before I had the answer.</i>
