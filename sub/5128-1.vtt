03:55.040 --> 03:56.610
Honey.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.900
You're awake.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.327
You're finally awake.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.525
It's so good to see those eyes.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.420
Where am I?

04:28.520 --> 04:30.443
You're at home.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.604
Where?

04:36.360 --> 04:38.442
You've been unconscious.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.760
From the impact.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.020
What happened?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.043
Traumatic head injury...

04:49.160 --> 04:51.527
from where you hit the windshield.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.940
The doctor says you might suffer
from memory loss.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.520
Temporary, they hope.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.203
Who are you?

05:16.320 --> 05:17.924
Honey...

05:20.440 --> 05:22.329
I'm your wife.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.166
And I'm gonna make you all better.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.700
Did you know the noodle
is not an Italian discovery?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.140
In spite of its popularity in the West,

06:39.240 --> 06:43.340
chicken noodle soup was actually
first created by the Chinese.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.445
The doctor says we need to keep
your brain as rested as possible.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.241
Which means not a lot of light.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.740
Not a lot to look at.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.842
It was a bad accident.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.488
I don't remember.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.260
How did it happen?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.362
You made a mistake, honey.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.131
We have plenty of time
to answer questions.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.322
Now you need your rest.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.288
Honey, you shouldn't be out of bed.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.401
You need to take it easy.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.524
Reddecker.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.005
All right, well, what's your story?

10:05.200 --> 10:08.204
All right, well, people go missing
all the time.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.764
If I don't find him dead,
I'll find him in the next small town...

10:12.880 --> 10:15.042
complaining about this small town.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.724
What else you got?

10:21.360 --> 10:22.885
A ransom note.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.604
All right. Well, send it over.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.564
I don't give a damn what you write.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.700
Let me tell you what I'll do.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.646
I'll take clips from your article
and I'll put it in my scrapbook.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.167
It's about time, sleepyhead.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.646
I was starting to get worried
I'd never see those beautiful eyes again.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.207
How long was I asleep?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.964
Two days.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.820
Jesus.

12:35.920 --> 12:41.006
The doctor says it's natural for a brain
in your state to get that much rest.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.688
- Doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.884
I heard...

12:49.360 --> 12:52.100
I heard voices and...

12:52.200 --> 12:54.851
I saw figures in my sleep.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.940
It was the doctor?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.407
Mmm. See?

13:01.880 --> 13:03.962
Getting better already.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.447
I'm gonna start cooking dinner.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.648
You shouldn't be out of bed, honey.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.420
My foot...

14:14.520 --> 14:16.100
doesn't feel broken.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.100
You're taking a lot of pain medication.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.931
You're not gonna be
feeling much of anything.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.682
I feel lost.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.641
Everything is new to me.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.884
Like the cats.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.528
I keep hearing cats.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.100
I don't remember ever having cats.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.444
Well, we do.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.420
Since you made it all the way down here,

14:57.520 --> 14:59.540
do you want to eat like a couple?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.660
The way we used to?

15:01.760 --> 15:03.728
Yeah.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.411
Good, because I made your favorite.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.604
My favorite?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.620
I'm sorry.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.961
Sometimes I forget you forget.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.700
Pot roast.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.848
You love my pot roast.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.689
When did we...

15:32.760 --> 15:34.603
move in here?

15:37.240 --> 15:39.500
Not long before the accident.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.285
So you had to go through all this?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.540
You shouldn't have to take care of me.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.980
I don't have to.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.730
I want to.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.330
You're my husband.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.324
Now let's eat.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.167
Come on, babies.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.681
Elephants are dying of coronaries.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.605
Excuse me?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.603
In the jungle.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.167
They're dying of stress about
their dwindling food and water supply.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.011
It's the stress that really kills them.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.402
Do you remember?

17:09.440 --> 17:10.980
No.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.446
You don't remember about the elephants?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.260
I don't... I don't remember.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.806
What do you remember?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.660
I don't remember where I grew up.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.411
You don't remember our senior bowl?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.282
Kissing me by the creek?

17:48.240 --> 17:50.322
You don't remember?

17:51.080 --> 17:53.003
I want to.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.609
I'm sorry.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.420
Did you know the first can opener,

18:11.520 --> 18:13.420
it wasn't even invented...

18:13.520 --> 18:17.764
until 50 years after the first
tin can was even produced.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.964
Wow.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.764
I've missed you.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.020
Have we been...

18:37.120 --> 18:38.804
happy?

18:42.040 --> 18:44.042
You have to ask?

18:46.840 --> 18:49.320
I think I just reminded you.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.404
Do you want me to remind you again?

19:12.120 --> 19:14.122
How did we first meet?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.683
Love at first sight.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.369
Where did we go on our honeymoon?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.202
Up north.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.050
Where up north?

19:39.960 --> 19:43.328
I wish the accident
hadn't messed with your brain.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.820
How did it happen?

19:55.920 --> 19:57.820
Why weren't you hurt?

19:57.920 --> 20:00.500
I was thrown from the car.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.525
Let's not talk about it just yet, honey.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.642
It will only upset you.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.964
I just want to think happy thoughts.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.540
There was a wreck on Highway 83.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.644
No victims were found,
but blood samples were taken.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.540
- Did you run plates?
- Yes, sir.

20:20.640 --> 20:24.281
The car hasn't been registered since
the '60s. It's a powder-blue Thunderbird.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.780
- How many victims?
- We don't know for sure yet.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.680
Judging from the belongings in the car,
two adults and a young girl.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.609
- What was the weather?
- Fair.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.380
- So no rain.
- No rain, sir.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.369
Okay. All right.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.860
- Should I, um...
- Give me an address? Yes.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.883
- Right now?
- Now would be good.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.082
- Okay. Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.929
Dad.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.740
Dad.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.562
What are you doing, honey?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.660
I was looking for you.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.780
Mmm.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.460
You shouldn't be out of bed.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.540
Please.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.688
I worry about you so much.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.968
Especially since the accident.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.051
You're right. I'm sorry.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.860
Why don't you go upstairs and undress?

23:41.960 --> 23:44.964
I'll be up in a minute
to draw your bath.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.980
No. It's okay.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.980
I can do it myself.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.730
This is a marriage.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.164
We help each other.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.370
Okay, well, I'll be waiting upstairs.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.049
Yes, isn't it?

24:06.160 --> 24:08.049
Mmm.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.420
There's a part of my nightmare...

24:15.520 --> 24:17.761
that I can't shake.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.082
Keeps coming back.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.890
There's...

24:37.200 --> 24:38.725
a girl,

24:41.800 --> 24:43.529
calling "Dad."

24:49.480 --> 24:51.380
Ever notice that battery sizes...

24:51.480 --> 24:53.562
come in "A," "C" and "D"?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.528
Why not "B," you ask?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.955
B-size batteries never caught on
in products made for consumers,

25:07.055 --> 25:09.118
so stores stopped carrying them.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.120
You can find them in Europe though,

25:14.240 --> 25:17.005
where they're used
to power bicycle lamps.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.962
Tell me something about yourself.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.450
I want to get to know you... again.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.002
Do you have other family?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.850
Do I?

25:51.120 --> 25:53.282
I want to get to know you.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.327
The woman that I love.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.404
Okay?

26:04.760 --> 26:07.206
I hate talking about my past.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.969
You knew that once.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.884
I just want to focus on our future.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.242
This is my film room.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.082
It's where I make movies.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.284
I don't remember.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.047
I can't remember any of this.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.940
I don't know what's yours,

29:26.040 --> 29:27.690
what's mine,

29:29.200 --> 29:31.202
where I can go...

29:33.080 --> 29:34.684
and where I can't.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.487
I forget sometimes too.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.770
That's okay.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.641
That's why I have this room.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.043
It's full of memories.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.565
To help me remember.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.406
I know this has been hard for you.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.802
Will you help me remember?

30:12.200 --> 30:13.725
I will.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.300
What's in that room?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.180
It's just a room.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.850
Another bedroom?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.700
Just a room.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.802
I thought I saw somebody in there.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.580
What do you mean?

30:35.680 --> 30:38.684
Behind the door.
I thought I saw somebody.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.420
I was just curious.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.330
You know what they say about curiosity.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.568
I'm just trying
to get my bearings straight.

30:58.668 --> 31:00.937
I know, honey. I know.

31:01.037 --> 31:05.580
I'm gonna go to the store and stop by work.
I have to go check on my patients.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.124
- Will you be okay with that?
- Yeah.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.010
What's wrong, honey?

38:26.360 --> 38:28.300
I've been in the basement.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.860
I saw him.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.860
I saw what you did.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.140
I told you to never go down there.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.369
I've never kept my first husband
a secret from you.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.642
Who are you?

38:43.240 --> 38:45.447
I'm the woman who loves you,

38:47.320 --> 38:49.482
who takes care of you,

38:51.080 --> 38:52.730
who feeds you,

38:53.720 --> 38:55.609
who bathes you...

38:57.280 --> 38:59.282
and makes love to you.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.084
I'm your wife.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.400
You seem a little depressed lately.

39:54.160 --> 39:59.246
Honey, do you know anything
about electroconvulsive therapy?

40:00.440 --> 40:03.060
Also commonly referred to
as shock therapy.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.620
Dates back to the 16th century
in Eastern Europe,

40:06.720 --> 40:10.720
but really gained popularity
in the United States in the 1930s.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.400
Although the therapy is controversial,

40:18.520 --> 40:22.420
it is still used today in this country
and around the world,

40:22.520 --> 40:24.522
primarily to treat severe depression.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.660
I think this will help you, honey.
I really do.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.850
See? That wasn't so bad, now, was it?

40:49.520 --> 40:51.204
Hmm?

40:53.520 --> 40:56.649
No. No.

41:31.040 --> 41:35.300
Did you know Conway Twitty
had 55 number-one hits? Hmm?

41:35.400 --> 41:37.528
That's more than Elvis Presley.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.124
Do you understand
how important family is?

42:17.800 --> 42:21.202
Strong families are the backbone
to this society.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.500
There's nothing more beautiful...

42:24.600 --> 42:28.660
than the foundation
of a husband and wife,

42:28.760 --> 42:31.491
raising their children in a proud home.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.163
I just need you to look
to the future, that's all.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.420
Forget the past.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.540
My body.

42:44.640 --> 42:48.220
Oh, it hurts.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.802
The shocks can leave a little bit
of an aftereffect.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.126
Please make it stop.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.060
Oh, please.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.083
Oh, make it stop.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.279
Do you love me?

43:08.880 --> 43:10.405
Do you?

43:13.360 --> 43:15.044
Yes.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.444
I love you too.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.488
Do you want this to stop?

43:24.520 --> 43:25.965
Yes.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.082
Well, I want something too.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.770
I want a baby.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.966
Isn't that what every wife
wants from her husband?

43:37.800 --> 43:39.211
A baby?

43:40.240 --> 43:44.609
I want a baby, a family to call my own.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.700
Do you want this to stop?

43:52.800 --> 43:55.060
Yes. Yes.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.561
Give me a family, and it will.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.642
Give and take.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.290
That's what a good marriage is about.

44:20.040 --> 44:22.486
Memories are wonderful, don't you think?

44:39.280 --> 44:41.282
I know you were curious,

44:42.560 --> 44:45.404
since you looked at my family album.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.922
I always know
when you look at my things.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.725
You don't put them back properly.

45:10.960 --> 45:14.089
Why are there no photos of us?
Where are they?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.530
That's not you.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.049
None of them are you.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.460
Hello. How are you, Dave?

47:31.560 --> 47:33.608
Always great when I can see you.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.660
Oh, aren't you sweet.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.820
I have a piece of registered mail.
I need your signature for it.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.090
Just a minute. Why don't you come in.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.740
Go into the kitchen.
I'll be right there.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.410
All right.

49:04.520 --> 49:07.683
You need to behave when we have guests.

49:18.160 --> 49:19.889
That's for good measure.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.700
- Is everything all right?
- I found you a pen.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.246
Oh, thank you. Let me get that.

50:24.620 --> 50:26.560
What are you doing?

50:27.720 --> 50:30.769
You want to know more about me?

50:30.880 --> 50:32.820
Look at me when I talk to you.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.404
You want to know more about my past?

50:43.560 --> 50:46.540
Or would you like to know more
about your past?

50:46.640 --> 50:48.460
What?

50:48.560 --> 50:51.404
About what happened
the night of the accident.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.851
When are you going to tell me?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.660
You really don't know?

50:59.760 --> 51:01.842
No.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.325
How could I?

51:25.920 --> 51:27.410
Honey,

51:29.520 --> 51:32.330
I put things to sleep for a living...

51:33.920 --> 51:35.900
and they don't wake up.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.780
Did you know that?

51:37.880 --> 51:40.740
I don't fucking care.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.820
This is what dreams are made of.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.361
One day you'll wish you cared more.

52:04.440 --> 52:06.124
Who is she?

52:09.520 --> 52:11.568
I keep seeing her...

52:13.720 --> 52:16.041
in my dreams.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.289
Is she my daughter?

52:24.200 --> 52:26.851
Is she our daughter?

52:28.720 --> 52:31.883
Please just tell me she's okay.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.449
I have work to do.

53:01.680 --> 53:04.580
Hey, listen. I'm swamped.
I'm gonna work from the office.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.860
Swing your squad car
by the bird streets,

53:08.960 --> 53:12.340
where... Magpie meets Mockingbird.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.010
Check that out.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.220
What do I think?

53:17.320 --> 53:19.460
I think he had a stroke and is dead,

53:19.560 --> 53:22.564
lying under a bush
with a bag of undelivered mail.

53:23.480 --> 53:25.448
All right. Let me know.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.440
Help!

54:53.043 --> 54:55.201
Help!

54:56.360 --> 54:58.203
Help me!

55:04.840 --> 55:06.080
Help!

55:27.400 --> 55:29.300
Help!

55:29.400 --> 55:31.050
Help me!

55:35.160 --> 55:37.162
Help!

55:39.760 --> 55:41.762
I'm in here!

55:43.520 --> 55:45.140
Help!

55:45.240 --> 55:47.820
I'm in here!

55:49.760 --> 55:51.569
Help!

56:14.640 --> 56:17.644
She should have left our family alone.

56:20.520 --> 56:24.980
Did you know that the bottle cap
is more expensive to produce...

56:25.080 --> 56:27.765
than the actual bottle itself?

56:35.040 --> 56:38.886
I am up out of my chair.
This had better be important.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.540
Oh, hell, I don't know.

56:42.640 --> 56:45.700
Well, maybe she just ran off
with the mailman.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.723
Did you call the officer?

56:47.840 --> 56:51.128
Did you go by her house? No?

56:52.320 --> 56:53.900
Well, here's a theory...

56:54.000 --> 56:57.620
She's at home putting her kid to sleep.

56:57.720 --> 57:00.564
Oh, and another thing...
She is off-duty.

57:04.840 --> 57:08.780
All right. I will knock on a few doors
on my way home.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.500
Now, if I come up missing,
you'll know one thing...

57:12.600 --> 57:14.887
I will be dead.

57:52.200 --> 57:55.010
You wanted to know more about yourself.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.402
I hope you're ready.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.322
It's okay.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.420
Don't cry.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.808
Shh.

58:15.360 --> 58:17.300
Oh, my God.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.688
You don't even remember
our own daughter, Audrey?

58:23.200 --> 58:25.885
Don't tell me you don't
at least remember her.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.324
She's been a bad girl.
I had to put her in time-out.

58:44.520 --> 58:46.488
Don't hurt her.

58:47.720 --> 58:50.460
Please. You can't do this.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.580
That is up to you.

58:52.680 --> 58:56.446
- Let her go.
- I will.

58:58.400 --> 59:00.482
Once you agree to get me pregnant.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.962
I need another child.

59:09.320 --> 59:12.130
Audrey has just grown up so quickly.

59:16.320 --> 59:19.642
Everything's gonna be fine. Okay?

59:26.480 --> 59:28.847
Whatever you want.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.807
Please, let her out.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.241
That's a good start.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.606
Are you gonna be a good girl?

59:46.080 --> 59:47.782
Good.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.124
Move on.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.969
Don't we look beautiful?

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.522
Don't ruin your makeup.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.364
Honey, I have a surprise for you.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.526
Now, don't we look
like the perfect family?

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.445
Go on, honey.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.968
I think it's finally time
to tell Daddy...

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.890
what happened the night of the accident.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.000
Don't!

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.362
Help me. Help me, please.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.805
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.690
Thirsty.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.568
Family is forever.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.128
No matter what.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.481
As long as you're alive,

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.980
counting together
other people's happy moments...

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.048
as if they're your own...

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.250
Your life,

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.522
your memories,

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.727
are what you want them to be.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.020
Did you know
that Walter Freeman invented...

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.600
what is called the ice pick lobotomy?

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.849
Freeman would hammer the pick
just above the tear duct...

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.088
and wiggle it around.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:51.369
From 1936 to 1950,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.370
the physician would travel cross-country
in a van he called...

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.169
the lobotomobile...

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.403
to demonstrate the procedure
to medical centers.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.540
This was heralded as
a great advance in surgery,

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.620
and was advocated as a general cure
to all perceived ills,

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.725
including misbehavior in children.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.250
I have never done
an ice pick lobotomy before,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.406
and I would never do
my first one on Audrey.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.161
I know it's a little extreme.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.726
I never intended to do this,

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.370
but I get the feeling that the two of you
will never be happy here.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.180
At least thank me for having the good sense
to try one on you first,

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.964
instead of Audrey.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.123
Now, who could be calling
at this time of night?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.140
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I'm investigating a missing persons report.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.780
I'm sorry to hear that.
I haven't seen anyone.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.899
I'm running a bath. Will you excuse me?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.286
Thank you.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.483
You ruined my floor.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.684
You ruined my floor!

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.410
Dad?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.685
Relax. You're safe now.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.570
My daughter... What's wrong with her?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.220
Is she...

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.449
You are lucky to be alive.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.090
Where...

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.260
Is she okay? Wh...

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.930
What's wrong with her?

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.282
I'm her father.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.890
Where am I?

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.925
Where...

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.882
What happened to my daughter?

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.922
Left with a question.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.922
Question?

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.980
Is she okay? My daughter?

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.130
Is she okay? Is she here?

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.091
She is? Is she... Is she okay?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.043
What?

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.124
My daughter.
Is my daughter okay? Is she...

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.369
Now rest.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.460
Oh, my God.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.927
I need my daughter.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.020
My daughter.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.940
My daughter, I... I need to see her.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.327
I need to see my d...

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.004
I need to...

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.962
I'm her father.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.201
I'm her father.

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:17.105
Dad!

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.540
I'm the detective assigned to your case.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.767
Well, I need your help, Detective.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.362
Oh, I'm sure you do.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.682
You know how you got here?

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.100
No.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.568
Shall we hold hands
as we walk down memory lane?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.330
Let's start with Audrey.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.940
My daughter.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.646
Why do you think she's your daughter?

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.121
Because she is.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.691
How do you know she is your daughter?

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.460
She...

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.180
She told me that she was.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.180
Who?

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.060
My wife.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.924
What's your wife's name?

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.407
I don't know.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.085
What's your name?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.442
I don't know.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.044
All I know is I have a daughter...

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.362
named Audrey.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.442
Not your daughter.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.020
Audrey Williams,
daughter of Mason Williams.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.645
A very wealthy individual.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.450
When she went missing,

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.884
a ransom note appeared in the mail.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.300
We have to do this.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.325
We need the money for my treatments.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.170
If you want a baby, let's do this.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.847
If I want a baby?

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.211
If we want a baby.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.887
That's what makes us a happy family.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.802
Do you care to tell me how
your handwriting got on the ransom note?

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.260
Got this handwriting sample
from your house.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.260
No, no.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.885
No.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.442
We know you kidnapped her.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.725
Audrey identified you.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.740
Hi there, darlin'.
We're new to the area.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.081
We're a little lost.
Would you mind helping us?

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.166
Thank you.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.540
- So...
- Just take the left to, uh... after...

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.165
Mm-hmm.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.140
You're facing a lot of time.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.580
To the fact, the three murder victims
we found in the basement of the house...

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.842
That's life.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.842
I didn't kill anyone.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.723
If you can't remember your name, how do
you know you didn't murder these people?

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.281
She did it.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.260
She hasn't been found.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.060
Which puts you in the right place
at the wrong time.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.164
Or the wrong place at the right time.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.609
Or the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.648
That's two wrongs.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.090
Right?

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.322
I didn't do it.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.842
Folks do lots of things
these days to have kids.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.407
I don't wanna do this.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.420
This is a bad idea.
I want to take her back.

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.964
This was a gift for us.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.640
Do you need help remembering?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.220
A lot of avenues to choose from.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.291
Very expensive roads couples go down
to achieve a family.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.580
All of your fertility
experiments are right here,

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.685
with each and every one
of your bills piling up.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.811
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.660
She wanted a baby in the oven
at any cost,

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.606
and you planned this kidnapping
to pay for it.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.451
So, that's my memory?

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.043
Yes.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.522
Dad. I want my dad.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.721
I want my dad.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.300
The doctor says we need to keep
your brain as rested as possible.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.380
Which means not a lot of light.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.005
Not a lot to look at.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:46.891
Honey, I put things to sleep
for a living,

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.780
and they don't wake up.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.769
Did you know that?

01:20:52.305 --> 01:20:58.851
