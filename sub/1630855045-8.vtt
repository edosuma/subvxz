WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:12.137
Good day, everybody. I'm Maya Ortiz.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.973
And welcome back to a special edition
of <i>Off The Court.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:16.850
LeBron James said it best.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.353
"Basketball is my passion,
but my family is everything to me."

00:20.895 --> 00:22.605
Today has a special meaning for me.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.109
I'm standing here at the intersection
of basketball and family

00:26.234 --> 00:28.319
in the Bell House,
practically my second home

00:28.319 --> 00:30.405
in middle school,
where basketball phenoms,

00:30.405 --> 00:32.449
Jordan and Josh Bell
were like my brothers.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.202
In the Bell home,
it was all basketball, all love

00:36.411 --> 00:39.080
and tonight,
we celebrate dreams made real.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.249
Okay, cut. That's the header.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.669
<i>The game of basketball
is very much like the game of life.</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:48.923
<i>Fluid. You acclimate.
You adapt. You overcome.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:50.675
<i>A smooth pivot.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.761
<i>- A sick double cross.</i>

00:52.761 --> 00:54.554
Oh, no, no, no.
The champagne is for later.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.680
And the cake is a surprise.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.390
- Can you take it around back, please?
- No problem.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.517
Where are they? Are they trying to ruin
my segment on purpose?

00:59.517 --> 01:02.062
-  I don't know.
- Mama Bell, here are your notes.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.480
- Thank you.
- And do you know

01:03.480 --> 01:06.107
who's blocking the driveway?
Mobile bartender wants to get in.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.068
I knew I should've banned him from coming.

01:08.359 --> 01:13.490
Okay, okay, the party can start.
Uncle Skinny has arrived!

01:13.615 --> 01:16.618
- You're late.
- But always on time.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.622
-  What's up? Hey.
Hey.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.748
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.000
Vondie, let’s grab a quick interview
before things start.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.960
You can talk
about what it was like growing up here.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.714
I know, you were gonna get at me
but my bad, our flight was delayed.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.093
Yeah? Well, you could’ve picked
a better time to go shopping in Paris.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.928
- Mm-mm.
- You know how important this is.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.888
Mm-hmm. Okay, so,
I guess, that little gift

01:36.888 --> 01:38.640
that we picked up for you from...

01:40.725 --> 01:43.770
Louis Vuitton doesn't matter then, huh?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.690
- It will suffice.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.983
Where's your nephew?

01:49.442 --> 01:53.196
- Uh... I think that...
- Go find my boy.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.825
Okay, I will. Filthy?
Where you at? Filthy? Filthy!

02:03.414 --> 02:06.126
Get inside! Barney, get inside!

02:07.460 --> 02:08.670
Somebody get there!

02:08.670 --> 02:10.755
Hey, Skree! Get through,
get through, get through!

02:17.262 --> 02:19.556
- Hey, Coach.
- Yo! Filthy, hey, please tell me

02:19.556 --> 02:22.809
- this means you're clear to play.
- I wish. I'm just here for moral support.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.060
- Move, go, go, go!
- Come on!

02:30.775 --> 02:32.360
- Come on, Ref!

02:32.360 --> 02:34.154
- Did you swallow your whistle?
- Easy.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.906
Get back on D, back on D!

02:43.121 --> 02:45.373
<i>Lakeside running away with this one.</i>

02:45.373 --> 02:47.792
- Hey, yo, that was for you, Filthy!
- Good, shake it off.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.627
Let's get down court. Let's go!

02:56.968 --> 02:58.428
You can ask me anything.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.139
For a long time, I was just angry.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.269
I had already made peace with the idea
that you never wanted me.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.857
Let’s, um...

03:11.816 --> 03:13.401
Let's set that straight.

03:14.527 --> 03:19.449
Your... your mom and I had you
when we were in college.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.411
We were kids,
and the moment that you came,

03:23.870 --> 03:26.080
like, from that moment,
everything changed.

03:26.581 --> 03:30.418
You were wanted, and more importantly,

03:31.377 --> 03:32.837
- you were loved.
But why now?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.924
I mean, after all these years,
you finally reach out to me, why?

03:35.924 --> 03:39.219
- Because now you need something from me?
- No! Kelli, no.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.638
There is no way in the world

03:42.138 --> 03:44.766
that I would ever risk the health
of any of my children.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.895
I would take a...
a lifetime of potential...

03:49.896 --> 03:53.316
health complications before I put
any of my kids under the knife.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.278
The reason why I reached out to you...

03:58.780 --> 04:00.365
is because I wanted my family.

04:01.199 --> 04:05.203
Not just for me, for all of us.
Especially your brothers.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.666
You know,
I couldn't imagine leaving this earth

04:09.666 --> 04:14.045
without filling the void
of not having you in my life.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.882
- What is that?

04:18.841 --> 04:22.553
- Need a timeout!

04:24.597 --> 04:25.682
Come on, hurry up.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.017
- Let's go, let's go, hustle, hustle.
- Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

04:28.142 --> 04:29.811
I'm good, man.
But I don't think we can do this.

04:38.444 --> 04:42.949
Last game at Hughes.
Can't believe we're going out like this.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.286
I don't know how to stop it.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.462
<i>I don't know how to stop it.
I don't know how to stop it.</i>

05:00.049 --> 05:02.593
<i>- I don't know how to stop it.</i>
Of course, you do.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.849
Dad? What are you doing here?

05:08.057 --> 05:11.060
Now, son, now, you know
I will always be here on your team.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.355
And you can count on your teammates
for an assist.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.942
Especially when you need them the most,
like right now.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.987
We're getting pummeled out there.
As in almost irrecoverable.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.406
- As in...
- As in change up the strategy.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.118
You’ve been here a million times before.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.203
Just because you're playing
a different position,

05:29.203 --> 05:33.666
- doesn't mean you're not part of the game.
- But I just wish I was out there.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.753
You are. Now, JB knows it.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.632
Your teammates know it.
Now, you gotta own it.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.801
Have faith.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.221
And right now,
you up against the biggest opponent

05:47.221 --> 05:48.431
that you ever faced.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.100
Yourself.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.520
Now, the question is, what you gonna do?

06:04.322 --> 06:07.617
Win the damn thing.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.303
You were a toddler when your mom died.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.891
I fought... hard for custody.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.977
I knew it was gonna be a battle,
but I was up for it.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.690
I heard things got weird.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.361
You know, my grandparents said
you pretty much ghosted us.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.698
I can't speak for your grandparents.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.326
You know, they have their own version.

06:52.328 --> 06:56.624
Look, I... I didn't wanna cause
any more pain or... or stress, so...

06:57.625 --> 06:58.751
I agreed...

06:59.669 --> 07:00.962
for them to raise you.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.756
And the moment I did that,
I got boxed out.

07:04.882 --> 07:05.883
I figured...

07:05.883 --> 07:09.137
...when you got older,
I... I would just reach out.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.848
But I had already lost one parent.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.518
I mean, I needed you.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.481
- So, how could you just ignore me?
-  All right.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.490
My graduation?

07:30.908 --> 07:31.909
Mm-hmm.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.831
- How’d you get it?
- I was there. Fourth row, back.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.332
You think...

07:39.542 --> 07:43.629
I'm gonna let my firstborn walk
across that stage and not be there?

07:44.505 --> 07:47.258
My girl. Salutatorian.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.802
Nah, I saw you up there.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.221
They should've let you
make that speech

07:52.346 --> 07:55.892
'cause the valedictorian.
Oh, God, they put us to sleep.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.894
Kelli...

08:00.563 --> 08:02.398
I never stopped loving you.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.362
Stopped being there for you.
And I never will.

08:09.655 --> 08:13.826
I want... We... we want you
to be a part of this family.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.916
Gentlemen, we have got to start moving
the ball around.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.542
We're missing way too many easy shots.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.962
This is selfish basketball.
Stick to the game plan.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.255
Yo, is this who we are?

08:26.255 --> 08:28.841
What, they put a little bit of pressure
on us and we cave?

08:28.966 --> 08:30.468
We ain't gonna win playing like this.

08:30.468 --> 08:34.180
Look, I understand the doubt.
Okay? I get it.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.182
But you can't lose faith!

08:36.474 --> 08:40.019
Okay? All great champions
have faced defeat.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.648
But stared it down
and still managed to get the rebound.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.817
That sounds great but like he said,
we're not even making shots.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.737
- We need you out there, Filthy.
- I am here.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.991
And I hear you but hear this.
This is y'all chance!

08:54.325 --> 08:55.910
But y'all gotta grab it!

08:57.286 --> 08:58.996
You remember Dad's basketball rule?

09:00.831 --> 09:06.712
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss.
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss.

09:07.171 --> 09:11.300
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss!
Dribble, fake, shoot, swish!

09:11.676 --> 09:15.054
Now, y'all gotta feel it, all right?
With me.

09:15.471 --> 09:19.225
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss!
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss!

09:19.225 --> 09:23.604
Dribble, fake, shoot, miss!
Dribble, fake, shoot, swish!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.482
Let's go! Let's go!

09:28.025 --> 09:32.113
Oh, oh, oh, oh, one more thing.
Dad said if you lose today,

09:32.738 --> 09:35.199
you might as well not bother coming home.
So, you know what...

09:36.033 --> 09:38.160
Let's go!
Let's go, Lions!

09:47.837 --> 09:49.297
- Come on! Watch out!
- Defend, defend.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.132
Rebound, Vondie, rebound!

09:52.717 --> 09:54.010
There you go!

10:04.520 --> 10:07.106
<i>Jordan Bell,
keeping the Lions in the hunt!</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:14.697
D up, D up, D up!

10:15.197 --> 10:16.490
No, no, no, no!

10:21.162 --> 10:22.371
<i>Zuma for three!</i>

10:23.080 --> 10:24.999
I hate this kid! I hate this kid.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.005
- We need a timeout!
- We're out!

10:36.135 --> 10:38.387
Let's go, JB!
- Let's go!

10:40.514 --> 10:42.266
Yo, JB, Flexis Alexis!

10:47.563 --> 10:49.148
Okay. Okay.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.859
You got it.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.321
Yeah!

10:55.571 --> 10:58.449
Yeah!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.670
My boys right there.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.005
- That's our boys, yeah!
- That's our boys, yeah! Okay!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.132
Whoa, whoa!

11:16.592 --> 11:19.178
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

11:19.303 --> 11:22.682
- Yes, yeah!

11:35.820 --> 11:38.823
- You're welcome.
- What are you talking about?

11:42.618 --> 11:45.121
Oh, wow! You weren't lying.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.415
- Ah. I told you.
No way.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.792
- Yo!
- Hey, hey!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.253
Hey! How's the champions?

11:52.461 --> 11:53.713
Yeah!

11:54.255 --> 11:55.381
- We did it!
- Uh-huh!

11:55.381 --> 11:56.882
- Brought that home.
- Kelli, you're here!

11:56.882 --> 11:59.385
You guys are champs now?
Thank you for the pizza, Chuck!

11:59.593 --> 12:01.345
Appreciate it! What up, nephs?

12:01.345 --> 12:03.681
Too far to reach, uh-oh!
Hide your wallets, people.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.559
'Cause Starbucks ain't got nothing
on this one right here!

12:06.559 --> 12:08.310
Oh, handshake, please? Come on.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.438
- We're family now. Good to see you.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.358
Hi. I'm Crystal.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.820
- Very nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.822
You guys wanna... Okay.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.116
I don't wanna overstay my welcome,
so I should just go.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.785
Oh, absolutely not!
We're having a party tonight.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.037
- There's a lot to celebrate.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.373
- Hey, who's ready to party!
- Hey!

12:30.249 --> 12:33.586
Guys, this is our sister, Kelli.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.171
Hey.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.547
<i>Let me get this straight, man.</i>

12:36.839 --> 12:39.175
You're telling me this entire time,
you've had a hot sister

12:39.175 --> 12:40.718
- and you didn't tell me?
Hey, careful.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.720
- That's my sis you're talking about.
- Come on now.

12:42.845 --> 12:47.600
Hey. Hey, look. This year...
...we've been through a lot.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.894
Guess what doesn't break us
only makes us stronger.

12:50.269 --> 12:55.608
I mean, yeah. This year helped me realize
just how important every day is!

12:55.983 --> 12:59.487
And to make sure each moment matters
and that the people around you know

12:59.487 --> 13:00.988
just how much they're loved.

13:02.698 --> 13:03.741
And, uh...

13:04.533 --> 13:06.786
- you carry them with you in your heart...
- Excuse me?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
- ...like the moonlight over the sea.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.041
You really oughta write
a book, man.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.918
All right, bro.
I'm done messing with y'all.

13:25.846 --> 13:29.433
Ah, I see
you found Chuck's jazz collection.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.310
It's wild.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.605
I mean, the one thing I inherited
from my mom was her jazz collection.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.149
Hmm.
- And she loved Nancy Wilson.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.819
- This was her favorite album.
- Aww.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.655
Maybe that's why they got together.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.240
Maybe.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.161
<i>Call me irresponsible...</i>

13:49.286 --> 13:52.957
Oh, yeah, that sounds
like your father at 21.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.045
You know, I'm happy the boys reached out.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.464
To see you and Chuck
have a second chance...

14:00.464 --> 14:02.174
I don't wanna make any promises.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.386
Yeah, I get it.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.346
Baby steps.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.348
And I don't blame you.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.851
It's gonna take a while
to build a relationship.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.815
- Sounds like it comes from experience.
-  With my own father.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.151
But that's another story
for another day.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.074
You know, I can already tell
that you being here

14:27.074 --> 14:28.659
has warmed Chuck's heart.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.703
Mine, too.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.834
Just kinda sucks
that it's under these circumstances.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.171
I know.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.550
But you're here now.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.350
All right.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.520
Mm-hmm. A little sparkling cider.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.857
- For my boy, some wine.
- Bruh.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.109
- What'd you put in this drink, bruh?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.737
- I don't know. Something to knock you out.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.990
-  All right.
- Look at me...

15:07.990 --> 15:09.950
We'll have to keep you
around a little bit more.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.244
Oh, so, you got jokes now? Mm-hmm.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.204
Well,
I'm just gonna need you not to forget

15:14.330 --> 15:16.373
to pay that speeding ticket
for your boy because I was flying

15:16.373 --> 15:19.001
- like a bat out of hell to get to you.
- Hmm. I got you.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.961
- But bro...

15:21.962 --> 15:22.963
Man.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.258
Seeing Kelli again, bro.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.597
I never thought,
like that was the...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.057
Yeah.
- ...distance.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.516
Yeah. So, what's...

15:35.935 --> 15:38.187
- what's next? You know?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.439
Yeah, well, the ball is in her court.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.650
- You know? I...
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.320
There's a lot to work through
but I told her I wanna be in her life.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.156
Hmm.
- You know, as much or little

15:49.406 --> 15:50.616
as she wants me.

15:51.200 --> 15:56.038
And the fact that she came here at all?
Yeah, it's good.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.539
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.707
- No, it's a good thing.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.584
The fact that she came

16:00.584 --> 16:03.462
and my little nephews balled out
on the court.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.051
But for real man, you know,
I should probably make it a point to be,

16:09.051 --> 16:12.221
you know, a little closer,
around a little bit more.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.473
You know, moving here
might not be such a bad idea.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.475
Hmm. You should run that by Crystal.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.685
- Yeah.
-  Okay.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.728
- That's a good point.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

16:19.728 --> 16:21.271
- That's a good point.
- I mean, we love you.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.524
All right, cheers
with your old apple cider.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.608
Mm-hmm.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.654
Filthy, your leadership skills
were on full display

16:28.654 --> 16:30.572
and you killed it in the semifinals!

16:31.115 --> 16:33.367
But, like you said,
a lot's been happening.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.496
So, what have your experiences
this year really taught you?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.207
Um...

16:40.207 --> 16:43.669
Basketball is a great teacher.
But it's not everything.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.797
What? Hold on,
that's news, Filthy

16:46.797 --> 16:49.508
Yeah. I... I think I'm starting to get it.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.762
You know, I'm seeing
that my dad's basketball rules work

16:53.762 --> 16:56.181
just as much off the court as on.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.685
You know, he's like a superhero to me.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.397
But with him facing his own...

17:04.273 --> 17:05.983
form of kryptonite, I, um...

17:08.652 --> 17:10.487
I don't, uh...

17:12.364 --> 17:13.866
You don't know how to protect him.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.326
It's scary.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.912
When my mom got sick...

17:19.872 --> 17:23.125
I started a journal.
I needed to get my feelings out somehow.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.501
It is scary.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.422
I mean, everything shifting around me.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.509
- Dad, Kelli, high school.
- But change can be good.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.012
Don't focus on boxing out the old.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.806
Focus on building what's new.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.979
Yo, I already got everything planned
for this summer, it's gonna be lit.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.690
What's the last thing you wanna do
before you leave for L.A.?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.235
Um...

17:52.863 --> 17:54.656
JB, you have to promise me something.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.076
I'll come to L.A. anytime you want me to.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.120
Good to know,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.039
What is it?

18:02.664 --> 18:04.374
You brought everything to the court today.

18:05.334 --> 18:09.379
You stepped up. And I believe in you.

18:10.005 --> 18:13.008
- You believe in you.
- Yo, what's wrong?

18:14.718 --> 18:18.097
I won't be at graduation... or summer.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.601
I leave for California in five days.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.401
What a day, babe.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.696
- You good?
- Mm-hmm. I'm better than good.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.533
My first dialysis treatment under my belt.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.494
- Hmm.
- Beautiful wife...

18:40.869 --> 18:44.790
- ...champion twins, my daughter.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.501
What more can I ask for, you know?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.295
Well, don't forget about Skinny.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.882
Mm. No, really. Skinny is thinking
about moving closer.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.468
- Closer to who?
- All right.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.554
- Don't play with me.
- Yeah, right?

18:59.680 --> 19:06.145
And Dr. Hong said that I am officially
registered on the donor directory.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.313
Now, we just play the waiting game.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.774
- Baby.
- Mm-hmm.

19:10.774 --> 19:13.152
You could wake up tomorrow
and have a donor?

19:13.318 --> 19:16.488
- Yeah, yeah.

19:16.947 --> 19:20.367
Mm-hmm. Well, either way...

19:21.410 --> 19:26.999
with you by my side, there's nothing
that we can't do. Complications and all.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.168
You're right about that.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.345
She didn't wanna tell me before my game

19:40.345 --> 19:43.557
because she didn't want it
to be a distraction. This sucks.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.518
Well, at least she said you could come
visit her in L.A.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.813
- Just focus on that.
- How can I take advice from you?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.358
You, who refuses to admit
his feelings for Maya?

19:54.234 --> 19:57.905
It's delicate.
Okay? We're just now getting into it.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.364
You know, like...

19:59.740 --> 20:03.160
Just last week
When our lips were a penumbra

20:03.160 --> 20:05.704
Her, the moon and I, the earth...

20:05.704 --> 20:07.998
All right, Shakespeare.
In English, please?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.666
Yo, you really need
to start reading more.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.336
- We kissed.
- What?

20:12.628 --> 20:16.298
- Yo, I knew something was up!
- Look, it changed everything.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.091
Everything.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.886
So, y'all just kissed?
Did y'all talk about it?

20:21.053 --> 20:25.015
Well, afterwards,
we kinda fell back into the friend zone.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.434
Filthy, Filthy, listen to me, man!

20:27.809 --> 20:30.312
Tell her how you feel.
Yo, you're the one with the words.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.855
I mean, usually, yeah but...

20:33.190 --> 20:34.483
I don't know, this is different.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.653
Trust me, man.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.531
There is nothing worse than losing time
with someone you care about.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.868
All that drama that went down with me
and Alexis at The Roll Call?

20:44.868 --> 20:48.830
I would give anything to get those days
of not speaking to her back.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.210
Tell her how you feel.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.377
I thought you left without telling me.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.302
Leaving doesn't mean I'm gone.
You'll visit. I'll visit.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.221
JB, don't stop doing
what you've been doing.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.807
You're on a roll! Run with it.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.060
But it was you who got me centered
to do what I'm doing in the first place.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.064
- How do I survive without you?
- So dramatic.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.817
I hate divorce.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.237
Yeah. I'm still having
a tough time with it.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.115
But both of us have to remember

22:05.115 --> 22:08.118
that sometimes things just don't go
the way we planned.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.871
Promise me you won't forget me.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.832
- I'm sorry, who are you again?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.336
I promise. I will never forget you.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.756
- Hey, look at this, Maya!
- Yeah?

23:02.881 --> 23:06.510
- Look at the views I got!
- Vondie, 56.6K views!

23:06.635 --> 23:08.095
I know, it's crazy!
Let's go!

23:08.095 --> 23:10.931
- I have no idea!
- I know, 65.6K!

23:13.141 --> 23:14.643
- Hey, hey, Maya!
Well, yeah.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.645
- And like, you, you were killing it.
- Maya!

23:16.645 --> 23:17.938
And at the championship game

23:17.938 --> 23:19.272
- I was like, "Vondie!"
Maya!

23:19.272 --> 23:20.816
What... Hey.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.610
Look, I have to tell you something.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.238
We...

23:27.155 --> 23:28.907
Look, that kiss changed everything for me.

23:29.282 --> 23:35.163
- What? Whoa. About darn time! Hey!
- It's been in my face this whole time.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.624
I just didn't know how to tell you.
I mean,

23:37.791 --> 23:39.459
I didn't know what words
could fill in the blanks

23:39.459 --> 23:42.212
when you're not around.
To punctuate how I feel

23:42.546 --> 23:46.883
when your smile dribbles across
the hardwood of my memory?

23:47.426 --> 23:50.929
I mean, I guess, what I'm trying to say
is that my eyes are open.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.475
You're the goal and I'm ready
to take that shot at us.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.855
- Really?
- Yes, really.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.773
Now? Really, Filthy?

24:02.691 --> 24:06.778
Everyone knows I've practically been
in love with you since the third grade.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.198
And now, that I have accepted
the fact that...

24:10.907 --> 24:14.202
- we'll only be friends...

24:16.037 --> 24:20.208
- Now your eyes are open?
- I mean, better late than never, right?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.629
I'm sorry, Filthy.

24:25.881 --> 24:26.923
You're too late.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.009
I...

24:31.386 --> 24:32.471
I'm dating Zuma.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.726
- Wow.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.813
Didn't expect that.
Hey, it's all good, man.

25:22.479 --> 25:26.233
Hi, Dr. Hong. This is Kelli,
uh, Chuck Bell's daughter.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.448
I wanna talk to you about getting tested.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.245
My whole summer is ruined.

25:39.037 --> 25:43.500
Shattered, shipwrecked
on the shore of lost possibilities.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.629
Yo, have you ever thought
about doing something wild?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.257
- Like what?
I don't know.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.260
Like going to high school
in another state?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.803
No, you're not trying to move down to L.A.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.138
with Aunt Roxie,
just so you can be closer to Alexis.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.849
Sometimes, thinking outside the box
is better than any plan.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.142
I don't know about that.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.104
Maybe something good
will come out of this summer.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.694

<i>Tonight is the culmination of a journey.</i>

26:11.278 --> 26:13.989
One in which so many of you
have played a part.

26:14.531 --> 26:18.702
Your joy, encouragement,
enthusiasm has contributed

26:18.702 --> 26:20.662
to this very moment.

26:21.413 --> 26:26.585
Years ago, a young poet,
who was also a phenomenal ball player

26:26.585 --> 26:29.337
got some great advice
from a well-known author.

26:30.005 --> 26:35.093
"Trust your words. They will take you
as far as you let them."

26:35.218 --> 26:37.512
And he did that! He did it!

26:37.721 --> 26:40.807
Yes, he did!

26:41.558 --> 26:45.520
And I am thrilled that he took those words
to heart,

26:45.520 --> 26:50.650
soared with them and wrote one
of the best new books of 2031!

26:55.488 --> 26:56.698
Gentle folks,

26:56.865 --> 27:01.036
you are in for a treat tonight
and I am so proud

27:01.411 --> 27:07.876
to present to you my son,
Josh "Filthy McNasty" Bell!

27:09.961 --> 27:13.590
<i>There was a time
when basketball gave me wings.</i>

27:14.007 --> 27:17.427
<i>When they got clipped,
trying to soar above bitterness</i>

27:17.427 --> 27:20.013
<i>and grief seemed impossible.</i>

27:22.057 --> 27:25.018
<i>Sometimes, you think things
are going one way</i>

27:25.644 --> 27:28.772
<i>but in the blink of an eye,
it changes direction.</i>

27:33.943 --> 27:36.446
All right.  Yeah!

27:37.697 --> 27:39.574
<i>Basketball rule number one.</i>

27:40.659 --> 27:45.038
<i>"In the game of life, family's the court,
ball is your heart.</i>

27:45.872 --> 27:50.960
<i>"Always leave your heart on the court.
Win or lose, do it together."</i>

27:53.755 --> 27:54.923
Hey Filthy. Stay focused.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.925
Don't let him live in your head,
all right?

27:57.676 --> 27:58.718
Got it, Coach.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.889
Hey, Filthy. You ready?

28:03.264 --> 28:05.308
I was born ready. Let's get it, bro!

28:06.434 --> 28:07.936
<i>Let's give a warm welcome</i>

28:07.936 --> 28:12.941
<i>to Beacon Academy's new head
basketball coach, Chuck "Da Man" Bell!</i>

28:13.692 --> 28:14.859
All right. Game on.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.407
- Coach.
