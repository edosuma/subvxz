01:18.640 --> 01:20.927
<i>Hustle up, guys.
You've got to get that defector</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:23.088
<i>and get the hell out of there. No delays.</i>

01:28.640 --> 01:31.007
Hey, Mouse, are you ready
with that 18-year-old aim?

01:31.400 --> 01:32.811
I'm on it, sir.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.121
Move. Let's go.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.001
All right, come on. Where is this guy at?

02:02.440 --> 02:04.761
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.607
All right, Mouse. Give us that diversion.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.007
Let's move.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.691
Flint, stay put.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.090
Anyone ever tell you you fight ugly?

02:40.480 --> 02:41.845
Not from their backs, they don't.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.360
It's just...

02:43.560 --> 02:45.722
Flint, let's go. Flint?

02:46.080 --> 02:47.411
What the hell are you doing?

02:47.720 --> 02:49.000
<i>Just marking our territory, sir.</i>

02:49.440 --> 02:51.488
Private Gaines,
if you see Flint, shoot him.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.727
With pleasure.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.641
Defector in hand.
En route to pickup. Come on.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.361
I don't see him, do you?

03:06.960 --> 03:08.440
<i>Flint, get your ass back to the team.</i>

03:08.480 --> 03:09.811
<i>We are on the move.</i>

03:11.600 --> 03:14.206
You ain't gonna believe this, Roadblock.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.367
Mother...

03:29.480 --> 03:31.369
<i>Since the end of the Nanomite wars,</i>

03:31.720 --> 03:35.042
<i>Captain Duke Hauser now leads
Joe Tactical Operations.</i>

03:35.480 --> 03:38.609
<i>Under Duke's command are Roadblock,</i>

03:39.640 --> 03:40.926
<i>Lady Jaye,</i>

03:42.360 --> 03:43.600
<i>Flint</i>

03:44.600 --> 03:46.011

03:48.320 --> 03:51.290
<i>The ruthless terrorist known
as Cobra Commander,</i>

03:52.480 --> 03:53.891
<i>and Destro</i>

03:54.840 --> 03:56.683
<i>have been captured by the G.I. Joes</i>

03:56.800 --> 03:59.280
<i>and placed in
a maximum security prison.</i>

04:00.160 --> 04:02.970
<i>But the Cobra operatives,
Storm Shadow</i>

04:03.640 --> 04:05.722
<i>and Zartan, remain at large.</i>

04:06.000 --> 04:07.809
<i>The unit and the world</i>

04:08.160 --> 04:11.482

<i>Retaliation.</i>

04:16.760 --> 04:18.841
<i>Contact front! Contact front!</i>

04:19.279 --> 04:22.443
<i>Heavy enemy fire! I need you to bring
them up the line. Bring them up the line.</i>

04:22.800 --> 04:23.847
<i>Check that, Block, but I can't, man.</i>

04:23.960 --> 04:24.927
<i>I'm taking rounds back here.</i>

04:25.040 --> 04:26.121
<i>I need you! I need you now!</i>

04:26.240 --> 04:28.288
<i>Air strike! Call in an air strike!</i>

04:28.520 --> 04:30.522
Wait. How do you call in an air strike?

04:30.680 --> 04:31.806
- Jesus!
- Can I bring...

04:31.960 --> 04:34.042
What about one of those, like,
care package thingies?

04:34.160 --> 04:36.686
I'm bleeding out
and I need you to sprint.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.327
Can you use a care package thingy?
I can bring you one.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.010
A care package thingy?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.849
Who is shooting me? What is...

04:43.440 --> 04:45.329
I'm bleeding out right there and you're...

04:48.880 --> 04:49.961
Are you spinning?

04:50.120 --> 04:51.246
You got to cover 360.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.407
You're spinning.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.007
How could you be so good at combat?
You stink at this.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.160
I think you need to relax.
I believe I outrank you,

04:57.280 --> 04:59.320
- last time I checked.
- Not in my house, you don't.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.481
All right. Taking fire!

05:01.840 --> 05:03.808
Enemy fire! Time out! Enemy fire!

05:05.600 --> 05:06.806
Enemy contact!

05:06.920 --> 05:08.763
Uncle Duke, you have big ears.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.888
You got a big head. Come here!

05:12.240 --> 05:13.685
Returning fire! What's up, now?

05:15.240 --> 05:16.207
Returning fire!

05:16.480 --> 05:18.164
You can't scream your way
out of this one!

05:18.320 --> 05:19.560
Yeah, requesting assistance,
brother Block!

05:19.760 --> 05:21.280
Pinned down, brother Duke.
Pinned down.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.886
That's all right. I got my boy here.
Demon dog!

05:27.840 --> 05:30.127
Grandma, help us! We need backup!

05:31.840 --> 05:34.764
Not the first time you sent a girl
running out of the room screaming.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.524
Not the first time
I sent two girls screaming from a room.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.006
Dude, completely inappropriate.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.364
- I'm just saying.
- Completely.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.000
<i>Violence continues across Pakistan</i>

05:45.120 --> 05:46.281
<i>in the capital of Islamabad</i>

05:46.400 --> 05:47.845
<i>following the assassination
of President...</i>

05:48.000 --> 05:49.604
<i>The future of the country

05:49.720 --> 05:51.449
<i>nuclear arsenal

05:51.560 --> 05:53.369
<i>as the vacuum created
by the killing remains.</i>

05:58.520 --> 06:00.807
The Pakistani President
may in fact be dead,

06:00.920 --> 06:03.287
but Pakistan remains an ally.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.687
And a sovereign nation.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.481
Was.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.047
Right now, they're a riot with a zip code.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.881
Sir, every minute
we spend debating this,

06:12.000 --> 06:13.764
there are live nuclear warheads

06:14.040 --> 06:15.530
that sit amidst the chaos.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.564
We can't let our enemies
get those warheads first.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.650
Recommendations?

06:25.720 --> 06:26.687
Go in.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.240
Now.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.445
Wait and see.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.608
History rewards the bold.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.924
I'm not going to be the man
who waited and saw.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.409
Get me the G.I. Joes.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.366
<i>Star One Flight commander
separating for drop.</i>

06:49.600 --> 06:51.170
All right, listen up!

06:51.480 --> 06:53.482
That nuke cannot have gone far.
Once we have it,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.888
we will disarm it en route to the L.Z.!

06:56.200 --> 06:57.850
We have its location narrowed down

06:57.960 --> 07:00.167
to somewhere in this
missile assembly building.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.169
We'll go in on the roof,
and fan out from there.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.529
Flint, Jaye, if any support is needed,
you'll reinforce

07:05.640 --> 07:07.040
as Roadblock leads the ground team.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.442
Hell, yeah.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.800
Hey, Mouse.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.244
On my first drop
I popped a live round into my mouth.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.091
Keeps your teeth from chattering.
Give it a shot.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.050
- Delicious.
- Attaboy.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.720
Jaye, what are we up against?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.490
Insurgents are armed
with Kalashnikovs,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.011
SVD Dragunovs and Type 50s.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.841
Cold War stuff.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.089
But don't relax, boys,
still put holes in you.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.731
Whoa! What have you got there?

07:37.040 --> 07:41.090
P-dub 381 black Tempest,
just out of the box. Rounds.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.329
Quarter speed, remote controlled.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.520
When did we get these?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.928
We didn't. We did.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.850
Distinguished Marksmen.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.969
- Let me see.
- Don't touch.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.330
Girls with guns.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.809
Approaching target.
Ten-hut! Make ready!

08:04.000 --> 08:05.160
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

08:05.360 --> 08:07.249
Anyone else missing Snake Eyes?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.124
I trained with Snake for six years.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.924
If he ain't here, he's got good reason.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.203
<i>Arch-Angel, go for drop.</i>

08:13.360 --> 08:15.328
Brother Block, as always,

08:15.440 --> 08:17.886
would you mind leading us
in a few words, please, sir?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.765
In the immortal words of Jay-Z,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.243
"Whatever deity may guide my life,"

08:24.800 --> 08:27.644
"dear Lord, don't let me die tonight."

08:28.000 --> 08:30.128
"But if I shall, before I wake,"

08:31.480 --> 08:33.049
"I accept my fate."

08:33.960 --> 08:34.927
Hell, yeah?

08:35.200 --> 08:36.530
Hell, yeah!

08:36.640 --> 08:37.880
Hell, yeah.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.400
Equipment check!

08:43.600 --> 08:44.681
- Check!
- Check!

08:44.880 --> 08:46.291
- Check!
- Check!

08:48.960 --> 08:50.450
- Check!
- Check!

08:50.640 --> 08:52.961
- Check!
- Drive it like you stole it!

08:55.200 --> 08:57.885
As your good friend,
you need a new catchphrase.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.440
- Hoo-ah!
- Hoo-ah!

09:04.120 --> 09:05.360
<i>Alpha, Bravo, radio check.</i>

09:05.760 --> 09:06.727
<i>Copy.</i>

09:09.400 --> 09:11.368
<i>Go in ghost till first contact.</i>

09:13.560 --> 09:15.961
<i>- Three and six on the floor.
- Copy that.</i>

09:21.400 --> 09:24.085
<i>Team two, expect heavy contact.
Bring the rain!</i>

09:29.880 --> 09:31.120
Move out!

09:32.840 --> 09:34.080
<i>Team three headed upstairs.</i>

09:50.000 --> 09:52.162
<i>Level 2 secure. Moving to level 3.</i>

10:03.560 --> 10:04.800
<i>- I owe you one, Mouse.</i>
- Clear!

10:19.800 --> 10:20.801
All right! I got eyes on the nuke!

10:21.080 --> 10:22.809
<i>Say again, I got eyes on the nuke!</i>

10:25.520 --> 10:26.885
But I'm taking heavy fire!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.730
<i>Sit tight! I'm taking a detour!</i>

10:28.840 --> 10:30.320
<i>Negative, Flint! Stick with the plan!</i>

10:38.560 --> 10:39.527
Tangos down!

10:42.840 --> 10:44.171
Go, go, go!

10:47.680 --> 10:48.841
Flint, status!

10:53.160 --> 10:54.127
Clear!

10:59.400 --> 11:00.640
Weapons secured!

11:02.640 --> 11:04.722
<i>- Equipment pack-up on level four!</i>
- Set!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.720
Clutch, station
the transport vehicle! Move!

11:09.080 --> 11:11.526
<i>All teams, rally to transpo, immediately.</i>

11:12.400 --> 11:14.289
<i>Insurgents closing in, sir!</i>

11:15.000 --> 11:16.729
<i>Team two secure. No losses.</i>

11:17.000 --> 11:18.968
- Contact headquarters.
- I'm on that.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.730
Mount up! Let's exfil.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.490
<i>- Runway secure.</i>
- Let's mount up!

11:40.600 --> 11:42.090
Nuke's disabled.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.965
Long-range transportation
and wheels down at 1900 hours.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.570
Home in time for <i>Top Chef.</i>

11:46.760 --> 11:48.171
Good job, Tiny Tim.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.320
All that Wii Combat Shooter
finally paying off, sir.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.601
- How you doing, sir?
- Good.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.080
All Joes present and accounted for.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.042
Sit rep?

11:55.240 --> 11:56.969
Rendered safe
and ready for transport, sir.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.528
Square this one away and go get a beer.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.801
Sounds good.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.680
<i>Sir, the nukes have been
recovered and disabled.</i>

12:04.840 --> 12:07.047
<i>All Joe missions successful.</i>

12:10.480 --> 12:12.369
<i>Only minor injuries to report, sir.</i>

12:12.640 --> 12:15.564
<i>Transport crews are prepping
the L.Z. for evac at 0200 hours.</i>

12:15.840 --> 12:16.727
Great job, Captain.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.968
We're modifying
your extraction plan back here.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.286
Sit tight.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.249
Let's go, Rivera, let's go.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.760
Let me get this straight.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.690
One whole weekend,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.529
you looking after my little girls.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.051
Look, I love your kids. I do.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.409
But they live to terrorise me.
You trained them well.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.401
And if you win?

12:39.680 --> 12:41.409
You have to take your next promotion.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.647
You pull a trigger, I pull a trigger.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.164
I don't know if I'm gonna trust a pastry
from a gumbo chef.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.170
Think about the wind.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.286
Four knots? Left to right.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.567
Humidity, I say, is about 62%.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.404
You gonna feed me
the barometric pressure, too?

13:08.520 --> 13:11.046
That's on the rise. Like your panties.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.884
You love my panties.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.044
That's an interesting choice of a joke.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.605
Of all the things you could say...

13:19.880 --> 13:21.928
- "You love my panties"?
- Are you gonna shut up?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.087
- What does that mean?
- You gonna shut up?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.006
- I'm looking out for you.
- I'm trying to do something.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.849
- I just don't...
- Shut up, just shut up.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.287
- I'm just saying.
- Just shut up.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.410
How's your head rate?

13:36.520 --> 13:38.329
That is not gonna count.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.169
I get to go again because you talked.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.364
You pulled a trigger.
Now I pull a trigger.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.446
No, we're not doing that.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.647
That is not gonna count.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.727
Cheater.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.680
I bought my little girls
a karaoke machine

13:56.800 --> 13:59.804
and they love singing on it,
all night long.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.850
There's no bedtime curfew,
so they're going to be up all night.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.321
Make sure you bring your earplugs.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.569
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.727
Best two out of three. That didn't count.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.600
You didn't tell me
about the karaoke machine.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.840
Zandar.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.531
Mr President.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.363
I brought you some news.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.641
The G.I. Joes are about to be
out of the picture.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.489
And by "out of the picture," I mean

15:01.040 --> 15:03.281
alive on earth.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.684
Got a little too close to Mount Olympus.

15:12.880 --> 15:13.959
Had to strike them down.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.920
Had to strike them down.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.171
They'll find you out, Zartan.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.807
No. No, I don't think so.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.409
That's the beauty of Nanomites.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.330
Here, take a look.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.847
Flawless microtechnology.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.440
You're insane.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.768
Recess over. Sit him down.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.086
You know, they say
this is a thankless job.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.764
But yesterday I hung out with Bono.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.608
My new Secret Service,

15:55.720 --> 15:57.529
they want to burn the Constitution.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.041
Literally.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.323
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.089
I bet that endears you to the people.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.521
Well, that's the thing.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.007
Your approval ratings
climbed nine points.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.603
Apparently, America wants
someone who looks like you,

16:15.720 --> 16:17.210
but acts like me.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.806
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.289
Only one drawback.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.649
The little wifey-pooh?

16:27.760 --> 16:29.000
If you touch my family...

16:29.960 --> 16:31.610
I'm yanking your chain.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.929
Two long terms of you,

16:34.760 --> 16:36.808
just a few shod months of me.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.287
So let's not waste the time I got left.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.602
Where is the prison that holds
Cobra Commander, and Destro?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.328
Is this where I ask you,
what do you have planned?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.170
Why does anyone want to be President?

16:49.640 --> 16:52.325
Everybody wants to rule the world.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.124
<i>All squads, gear up and clear the L.Z.</i>

17:02.640 --> 17:04.165
Prepare for extraction.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.601
Extraction? What are we, teeth?

17:07.119 --> 17:09.327
- Reach H.Q.?
- No, I got nothing.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.207
- Go up high.
- Roger, Sarge.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.121
Block.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.521
All our men accounted for.
Not a single drop of blood.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.761
- Boots to asses.
- Yes, sir.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.369
Except for that...
Did you scrape your elbow?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.926
- No, it's red sweat.
- Yup.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.840
That better have been
on somebody's face.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.486
Hey, Duke.

17:33.840 --> 17:34.921
You see that?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.200
Security's early.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.331
- Get down!
- Take cover!

17:44.480 --> 17:45.720
Take cover!

17:48.040 --> 17:49.565
To your weapons! Let's go!

17:54.880 --> 17:56.405
On the ground! On the ground!

18:01.600 --> 18:02.567
Mouse!

18:04.120 --> 18:05.531
Get 'em out of the L.Z.!

18:05.640 --> 18:06.607
Medic!

18:06.760 --> 18:07.727
Go!

18:14.040 --> 18:15.769
Flint's down! Flint's down!

18:16.120 --> 18:18.009
- I'm going for him!
- Go!

18:23.280 --> 18:24.406
Ten o'clock!

18:29.160 --> 18:30.161
Get down!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.928
Troops in contact!
Request immediate air support!

18:34.040 --> 18:35.690
I repeat, immediate air support!

18:37.480 --> 18:39.721
You all right? Come on, we got to move!
Go, go, go!

18:42.440 --> 18:43.487
Help me!

18:44.120 --> 18:46.009
You good? You hit?

18:46.840 --> 18:48.560
Block, I got Flint. We got to get to cover!

18:49.800 --> 18:50.801
Come on.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.487
Incoming! Incoming! Go, go, go, go, go!

19:07.760 --> 19:09.125
<i>Duke, come in.</i>

19:10.240 --> 19:11.162
Duke!

19:12.160 --> 19:13.127
Duke!

19:14.280 --> 19:15.361
Get to cover, now!

19:17.720 --> 19:20.041
- Go! Pull back! Rally point!
- Let's go!

19:25.560 --> 19:26.800
Get to the well! Go!

19:26.960 --> 19:28.485
Clear 'em out of there.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.601
Fall back!

20:31.920 --> 20:32.967
We're clear.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.527
Let's go!

20:54.120 --> 20:56.805
<i>We have met the enemy</i>

20:59.160 --> 21:00.730
<i>and he is us.</i>

21:02.120 --> 21:05.522
<i>Today, the world's elite fighting force,
the G.I. Joes,</i>

21:05.880 --> 21:07.848
<i>abandoned their duty</i>

21:11.000 --> 21:14.243
<i>and broke the sacred bond
that exists between</i>

21:14.720 --> 21:16.051
<i>the American people</i>

21:16.280 --> 21:19.045
<i>and those entrusted with their security.</i>

21:22.520 --> 21:24.887
Ready and step.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.920
Ready and

21:28.240 --> 21:29.162
step!

21:29.400 --> 21:32.882
<i>The first domino fell with the murder
of the Pakistani president.</i>

21:33.640 --> 21:35.051
The assassin,

21:35.600 --> 21:36.840
<i>a Joe,</i>

21:38.200 --> 21:39.565
<i>call sign</i>

21:40.440 --> 21:41.851
<i>Snake Eyes.</i>

21:43.280 --> 21:44.884
<i>But he didn't act alone.</i>

21:47.440 --> 21:49.920
<i>The Joes intended to use this situation</i>

21:50.040 --> 21:53.203
<i>to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</i>

21:53.560 --> 21:54.925
<i>Now this incident</i>

21:55.040 --> 21:58.931
<i>serves as a sobering reminder
of the scourge of nuclear weapons.</i>

21:59.240 --> 22:00.810
And to that end,

22:01.160 --> 22:03.640
I call upon my fellow world leaders

22:03.760 --> 22:06.764
to convene immediately to discuss

22:07.120 --> 22:09.168
nuclear disarmament.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.527
On three.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.201
One.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.726
Two.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.087
Three!

22:18.760 --> 22:20.285
<i>The G.I. Joes</i>

22:20.440 --> 22:23.410
<i>clearly went beyond
the boundaries of their mission.</i>

22:23.520 --> 22:24.521
<i>On my orders</i>

22:24.840 --> 22:28.003
<i>a covert Special Forces unit
code named Cobra</i>

22:28.240 --> 22:32.325
<i>terminated with extreme prejudice
Joe Command,</i>

22:33.040 --> 22:34.769
<i>facilities, personnel.</i>

22:39.240 --> 22:42.767
The G.I. Joes are no more.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.920
We should leave.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.285
There's nothing here.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.486
There's nothing left here?

23:33.640 --> 23:35.324
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!

23:35.440 --> 23:36.487
That's not what he meant!

23:40.880 --> 23:43.884
Whoever did this is going to come back.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.840
We need to move.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.608
You are our leader now.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.242
We head due east until we're clear.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.850
We're gonna find the man
who did this to Duke

24:12.960 --> 24:14.166
and our brothers.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.765
And we're gonna kill him.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.601
Snake Eyes.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.849
Last place I thought I'd see you.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.041
Warden James. It's a pleasure.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.971
I'm a very big fan. I love the black.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.525
It's very Johnny Cash.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.000
Come. Welcome to Einsargen.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.567
Let me tell you a little bit
about the place.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.649
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.285
I'm not here to sell you anything.

25:23.640 --> 25:26.007
Except maybe hopelessness.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.046
How was your trip?

25:47.960 --> 25:51.123
The sensation that you're feeling,
your upside-down tummy?

25:51.480 --> 25:54.086
It's due to our descent into
a former East German mine shaft.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.089
It was the deepest they ever dug.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.364
So deep in fact that
you just crossed out of Germany

25:59.480 --> 26:01.209
into international territory.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.449
Which allows me

26:04.200 --> 26:06.168
certain jurisdictional freedoms.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.120
One word,

26:15.560 --> 26:18.484
awesome. This room is awesome!

26:19.080 --> 26:22.243
Temperatures here exceed 210 degrees

26:22.680 --> 26:26.002
when not artificially cooled to a crisp 68.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.807
Almost calls for a Snuggie.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.600
Wait till you see this next one.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.844
See what I mean? This just slays me.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.844
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.649
Did you know that during REM sleep

26:49.000 --> 26:50.650
the human body

26:51.960 --> 26:53.450
produces a neural chemical

26:53.800 --> 26:55.450
which paralyses
every muscle in the body

26:55.560 --> 26:58.166
but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us

26:58.520 --> 27:00.090
from acting out our dreams.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.046
We have injected both of these men

27:03.800 --> 27:05.131
with a synthetic version.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.290
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious,

27:07.400 --> 27:10.006
they're aware of everything
that's going on around them.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.004
It's just that they're
trapped inside themselves.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.930
Well, I believe you know
your new neighbours, Destro,

27:25.120 --> 27:26.360
Cobra Commander.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.766
The three of you are like
my fantasy football team.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.081
Gentlemen.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.248
Now as your eyes and mind

27:44.600 --> 27:48.400
travel to where you cannot,
I want you to agonise.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.330
I want you to pine.

27:50.680 --> 27:54.321
I want you to ache for what once was
and will never be again.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.164
I want you to doubt
that there was ever a word for escape.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.211
Welcome to hell.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.846
You have no idea.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.569
Snake Eyes speaks.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.607
It never occurred to me
what you might sound like.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.486
But I've always thought about
what you might look like.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.529
We'll have that mask.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.489
Storm Shadow.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.368
So you killed the Pakistani president.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.329
Well, you're not exactly
my first-round draft pick,

28:40.440 --> 28:42.329
but I've always been a fan.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.528
Protocol says we make
a distress call, right?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.291
No. Protocol died with the unit.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.481
What?

28:53.600 --> 28:54.886
How's anybody gonna know we're alive?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.200
They're not, 'cause we're not.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.040
To our government,

28:58.400 --> 29:01.404
to our families,
but especially to our enemy,

29:01.520 --> 29:04.364
we were KIA at 0600 hours
in the Indus Valley Desert.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.443
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...

29:06.640 --> 29:09.246
No. Anything we do now
is a rumour of a rumour.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.327
Any and all traces

29:10.560 --> 29:12.244
of our existence is terminated.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.445
The only one I trust out there
is Snake Eyes.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.371
When we got hit,

29:20.280 --> 29:21.691
how we got hit,

29:22.440 --> 29:24.169
we were set up right from the start.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.450
How many stars would someone need
on their shoulder

29:26.560 --> 29:28.847
to call an attack like that? Four? Five?

29:28.960 --> 29:31.486
No, not stars. Buttons on his suit.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.491
National Security Advisor.
Secretary of Defence.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.729
No. There's only one man
who could authorise a strike like that.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.130
And I voted for him.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.089
All vitals on Cobra Commander
are steady.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.808
Storm Shadow
nerve prohibitors injected.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.042
Sixty-two degrees on a change of 4%.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.560
Aerial threat! Down!

31:32.000 --> 31:33.365
We're going home.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.569
Full arrest! Full arrest!

32:05.000 --> 32:06.570
No drill! Bring the restraints!

32:06.720 --> 32:07.960
Remove the containment lid!

32:09.360 --> 32:10.964
Where's the serum? Quickly!

32:12.600 --> 32:14.807
Adrenaline now. Now! Adrenaline!

32:15.040 --> 32:17.088
Let's go! Quickly, quickly!

32:18.280 --> 32:19.281
Move! Move!

32:21.480 --> 32:22.891
Where's the serum?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.091
Let's go!

32:30.840 --> 32:31.762
Peel back! Move!

32:31.960 --> 32:33.680
What do you mean,
his heart stopped beating?

32:33.800 --> 32:36.246
No one here dies unless I say so!

32:37.080 --> 32:38.241
Oh, my God.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.282
Fire!

32:41.640 --> 32:42.721
Fire! Fire!

32:45.960 --> 32:47.086
Take him down!

32:47.360 --> 32:48.646
Take him down!

33:21.640 --> 33:22.971
Clear on the north!

33:23.400 --> 33:24.481
Clear!

33:49.480 --> 33:50.891
Welcome to hell.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.166
Slop!

35:14.640 --> 35:17.484
You shoot anything
that walks through that door!

35:18.400 --> 35:19.481
Anything!

35:25.120 --> 35:26.531
Storm Shadow.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.610
Never a doubt.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.649
Cobra Commander.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.362
Destro.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.289
You're out of the band.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.641
Come on.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.967
Come on.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.280
I see you've arranged transportation.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.451
Making more things go boom
by 9:00 a.m.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.449
than most people do all day.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.043
Firefly. Good to see you, old friend.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.481
Sir.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.681
Some people
just didn't want to let me in.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.922
Now, I busted out of eight prisons.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.770
But I only broke into one.

36:31.680 --> 36:35.480
All communications have been cut off.
No one will know you're even missing.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.648
Take him to the mountains to heal.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.242
I'll need him
for the war I'm about to start.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.720
Sir, launch controls are nearly up.
The director was running behind.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.005
Well, he ain't running behind no more.
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.568
Armour prototype
is complete to your specs.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.444
I got it up to 60 on the dyno today.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.529
You'll like this. Working title,

37:49.640 --> 37:51.927
High Speed Sentry. HISS.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.124
It's good to have you back, sir.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.930
Ain't she a beauty?

38:01.280 --> 38:05.080
Soon the world will cower
in the face of Zeus.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.127
All we've been missing
is our Commander.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.128
Good to have you back, boss.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.251
Cool mask.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.289
Someone took his time.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.325
Not easy to sneak out of that big, white,

38:30.680 --> 38:33.047
11-bedroom, 35-and-a-half bath...

38:33.360 --> 38:35.522
Just don't forget who put you there.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.369
Or the rock you crawled out from.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.082
Firefly. It's good to know
we're not running low on crazy.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.091
Still all 10 fingers?

38:48.400 --> 38:49.970
How is our former President?

38:50.160 --> 38:52.208
He is worth his weight in platinum.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.723
You know, they call it a waterboard,

38:56.160 --> 38:57.969
but I never get bored.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.523
In 48 hours, Zeus will launch.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.211
Just one wrinkle.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.886
Three Joes somehow survived
our little house cleaning.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.485
A drone picked up voiceprints
in the Indus Valley.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.409
Can I trust you with nothing?

39:13.680 --> 39:15.091
They'll slip up.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.809
And when they do,

39:18.560 --> 39:20.289
I'll hunt 'em to ground.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.331
Hoo-ah.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.204
First the massacre in the desert,

39:29.600 --> 39:33.400
and now Storm Shadow
and Cobra Commander escape prison.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.808
So your training is
more important than ever.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.685
Jinx, cousin to Storm Shadow,

39:39.760 --> 39:42.889
Snake Eyes,
it is our time to join the fight

39:43.920 --> 39:47.163
<i>and defend the honour
of our fellow G.I. Joes.</i>

39:47.520 --> 39:49.568
<i>We must find Storm Shadow.</i>

39:49.960 --> 39:53.248
<i>He may know more about the future
of Cobra attacks.</i>

39:53.600 --> 39:58.208
<i>I fear what happened with the Joes
may only be the beginning.</i>

39:58.560 --> 40:00.085
Defend yourselves.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.963
Your enemy will show you no mercy.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.605
Enough, Snake Eyes.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.009
I know you doubt Jinx's loyalty.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.039
But she is Arashikage
and she will fight with honour.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.646
But she is Arashikage
and she will fight with honour.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.728
<i>The longer we wait,
the stronger Storm Shadow becomes.</i>

40:40.000 --> 40:42.685
With this sword
you must capture him,

40:42.800 --> 40:45.724
so we can uncover Cobra's plans

40:45.840 --> 40:47.808
and restore the Arashikage's name.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.646
But in order for me
to bring him to justice,

40:52.440 --> 40:55.603
you must deliver him to me alive.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.170
No, no, it's cool.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.807
I got it.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.560
You lost, little man?

41:18.560 --> 41:19.971
No, I ain't lost.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.329
I think you got the wrong street.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.369
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus

41:24.480 --> 41:26.050
and Ryan Seacrest

41:27.040 --> 41:28.451
and head back that way?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.169
I'm going that way.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.681
Oh. yeah?

41:34.800 --> 41:35.847
Yeah.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.650
Go ahead, Marvin.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.324
Man, don't call me that name.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.371
What's up? Little Marvin!

41:44.640 --> 41:45.880
- Marvin?
- Big Marvin now.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.570
Had you worried for a minute, man.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.280
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.124
Let me introduce you. This is Flint.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.207
What up?

41:53.720 --> 41:54.767
Lady Jaye.

41:54.880 --> 41:55.847
Lady Jaye. Hey.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.806
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.009
It's what happens
when you're in trouble, you come home.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.167
Home is where the help is.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.202
Amen.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.011
Well, we got you.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.725
Set up at the rec centre.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.968
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.050
As far as wheels go,

42:10.560 --> 42:12.289
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.447
Thank you.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.601
I got payments on that truck, man.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.523
I don't get it like I used to. All right?

42:17.640 --> 42:18.562
Thank you, Stoop.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.850
I owe you one, brother.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.726
Actually, you owe me two.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.731
That other one don't count.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.360
Welcome home, Marvin.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.286
Watch your step.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.649
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.487
Wow. It's an actual pit.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.170
It's my old stomping ground.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.801
Are you sure
we can trust this Stoop guy?

42:55.120 --> 42:56.531
Stoop's no angel.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.929
But he is family and we can trust him.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.680
Can we be traced?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.769
We can mask our IP addresses.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.087
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon
every six hours.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.771
If any Joes did survive,

43:12.880 --> 43:14.041
we need to let them know
where we're at.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.400
All right. Well, let's get to work.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.680
Flint, inventory every piece
of equipment we got left.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.762
Jaye, start that database
on our President.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.360
We'll find out what's going on
with our Commander-in-Chief.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.484
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why,

43:25.680 --> 43:27.728
we can start being soldiers again.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.722
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
requesting immediate aid.</i>

43:46.880 --> 43:48.211
<i>If any Joes have survived...</i>

43:48.320 --> 43:50.607
This channel's restricted to Joes,
isn't it?

43:51.040 --> 43:52.849
<i>...magnetic west of the Potomac.</i>

43:53.120 --> 43:54.121
They're alive.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.767
<i>This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye
requesting immediate aid.</i>

43:57.840 --> 44:00.411
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.</i>

44:00.520 --> 44:02.284
<i>We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.</i>

44:06.800 --> 44:08.564
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx
grab Storm,

44:08.680 --> 44:10.444
they're still halfway around the world.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.200
We're on our own.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.560
Enough for a battle.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.527
Not a war.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.051
We're fighting uphill here.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.964
I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.043
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

44:33.680 --> 44:35.125
became my home.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.160
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.323
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.921
Till one winter,

44:44.080 --> 44:46.526
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.083
I punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.568
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

44:53.800 --> 44:55.643
I'd already beaten down half of it.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.330
I became a Joe to serve. In the field.

45:00.920 --> 45:04.367
So if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.087
Hey, I got something you'll want to see.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.607
During my check of the President,
look what I found.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.488
This is the President on August 9th.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.809
<i>...an addiction to offshore energy,</i>

45:18.080 --> 45:20.811
<i>where we're forced to be
kind of embroiled</i>

45:20.920 --> 45:22.684
<i>in the affairs of foreign nations.</i>

45:22.880 --> 45:24.609
And this is 10 days later.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.570
<i>I mean, otherwise, we're sort of..</i>

45:29.000 --> 45:31.526
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases

45:31.800 --> 45:33.404
we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up

45:33.680 --> 45:34.966
with our mouth. Like...

45:35.160 --> 45:36.400
- Like.
- Yes.

45:36.680 --> 45:37.920
And our President?

45:38.200 --> 45:40.089
Between August 9th and August 19th,

45:40.440 --> 45:41.851
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

45:41.960 --> 45:44.008
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."

45:44.360 --> 45:46.567
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

45:46.680 --> 45:47.806
<i>"Soda" became "pop."</i>

45:48.480 --> 45:50.847
One President, two fingerprints.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.964
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...

45:53.080 --> 45:54.047
Check this out.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.884
Two press conferences,
July 31st, September 1st.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.640
See his fingers clasped?

46:01.120 --> 46:03.168
Left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.120
The same person
never does this differently,

46:05.200 --> 46:06.361
it feels wrong.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.129
What if the President

46:13.120 --> 46:14.531
isn't the President?

46:14.880 --> 46:18.521
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief
is an imposter

46:19.520 --> 46:21.727
and he's the one that ordered the attack,

46:22.080 --> 46:24.606
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.201
There is one man.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.200
He's the reason we call ourselves Joes.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.402
Hello?

47:13.600 --> 47:17.082
I'll take two cases of Thin Mints
and a box of Chuckle Lucks.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.330
Lower your weapons.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.480
General Colton, if I may...

47:23.800 --> 47:25.131
Shut your mouth, Brenda.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.370
My name's not Brenda.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.880
How'd you get in?

47:30.240 --> 47:31.810
Sir, apologies.

47:32.160 --> 47:34.208
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.891
Then you know why I'm here.

47:43.840 --> 47:46.047
<i>It's not like
I don't hear what you're saying.</i>

47:46.880 --> 47:48.769
But an imposter President?

47:52.080 --> 47:54.686
How come when the General says it,
it sounds crazy?

47:56.080 --> 47:57.969
What'd they do with the real President?

47:58.280 --> 47:59.520
We fear he's dead.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.564
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.609
"Conrad Hauser. Duke."

48:09.280 --> 48:10.520
Your captain.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.528
Tell me one thing you know about him.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.450
Great soldier.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.210
Better friend.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.929
And he saved my life, sir.

48:28.840 --> 48:29.807
Good.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.770
What you're proposing is treason.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.568
I'm gonna need something
a little more to go on

48:37.680 --> 48:39.091
than overlapping thumbs.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.640
Before you retired,
you sewed on a security commission

48:43.720 --> 48:45.484
with the President's Chief of Staff.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.529
General Colton, can you get us close?

48:47.920 --> 48:49.001
Negative.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.130
I can't scratch my ass in this town
without getting on the watch list.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.089
Brenda, hand me that pen.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.764
Girl Scout to secretary.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.965
Amazing. Name's not Brenda.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.650
It's just a pen.

49:06.440 --> 49:09.364
Avenue K, Georgetown. 9:00 p.m.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.684
There's a poker game
with the Chief of Staff there.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.931
He's not a good poker player.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.360
He's got 1,000 tells.

49:20.360 --> 49:21.805
We only need one.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.247
Hey, hon.

49:26.440 --> 49:29.171
Just got out of poker. Poorer but wiser.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.724
It was a good day, actually.

49:32.040 --> 49:34.281
The Prez was taking
his crazy pills again.

49:36.840 --> 49:39.047
Baby, I'm gonna have to call you back.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.361
Yeah.

49:40.560 --> 49:41.800
Love you.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.327
Excuse me.

49:48.560 --> 49:49.607
Hi.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.761
Hi.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.849
You need a hand with your bags?

49:53.520 --> 49:54.601
Sure.

49:56.520 --> 49:57.520
No problem. There you go.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.482
Thank you.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.928
Who said chivalry is dead, right?

50:01.040 --> 50:02.087
Chivalry.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.164
Talk like that,
I'm gonna get myself in trouble.

50:05.520 --> 50:06.567
Where we heading?

50:06.680 --> 50:07.840
Just right around the corner.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.723
That tingly feeling is amobarbital.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.127
It's a sedative that causes
anterograde amnesia.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.760
In five minutes, you're gonna be asleep.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.480
In another five, you're gonna wake up
with no idea I ever existed.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.281
Notice anything strange
about your boss?

50:35.840 --> 50:37.604
Maybe. Why?

50:37.920 --> 50:40.520
'Cause you're gonna make
a phone call for us. Get us close to him.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.650
But don't worry.
You're gonna forget everything,

50:42.760 --> 50:44.762
so your conscience will be clear.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.483
Why are you doing this?

50:47.720 --> 50:49.643
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.171
Make the call.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.680
Thank God.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.527
<i>El Presidente is on a roll.</i>

59:23.040 --> 59:24.371
<i>His numbers are up.</i>

59:24.480 --> 59:26.801
<i>And I'm not just talking about his age.</i>

59:28.640 --> 59:30.847
<i>Now, I'm not gonna call
our Commander-in-Chief old.</i>

59:31.480 --> 59:34.211
<i>Actually, he called me the other day
for some advice.</i>

59:34.360 --> 59:35.964
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.886
<i>He wanted to hook up
the nation's nuclear arsenal</i>

59:39.000 --> 59:39.967
<i>to the Clapper.</i>

59:44.800 --> 59:45.881
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am, you're...</i>

59:46.040 --> 59:47.530
Late, I know.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.720
Imagine the army it takes
to make me look like this.

59:50.200 --> 59:53.363
Forgive me.
That's an army I'd like to enlist in.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.284
Speaking of lists,

59:55.520 --> 59:57.841
would you like to explain
why you're not on ours?

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.609
Here she is. Chief of Staff.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.247
Enjoy your evening, Miss Vandervoort.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.922
<i>I'm in.</i>

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.889
Roger that. Standing by.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.842
Jaye?

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.847
You keep your head down. Be safe.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.525
<i>Mr Carville was nice enough to mention</i>

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.450
<i>one of my passions.
Nuclear disarmament.</i>

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.086
<i>In just days,</i>

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.601
<i>the leaders of the world's
eight nuclear nations</i>

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.486
<i>will gather at historic Fort Sumter</i>

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.609
<i>for a nuclear summit.</i>

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.163
<i>But before the Atomic Eight
break bread,</i>

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.521
<i>it's our turn.</i>

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.210
Thank you, James. Thank you so much.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.767
Mr President.
Amy Vandervoort, Fox News.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.002
<i>Fox, of course.</i>

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.202
That's why you look so
"fair and balanced."

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.761
Very cute.
But I was actually hoping to have a...

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.082
Dance?

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.810
I was going to say, quote.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.320
<i>Okay, here's a quote.</i>

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.125
<i>The world will change
after my nuclear summit.</i>

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.730
<i>How about we dance?</i>

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.048
<i>I really, I don't dance.</i>

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:10.962
Sorry.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.728
<i>Thank you, Mr President.
You gave me what I need.</i>

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.809
<i>But I really have to make my deadline.</i>

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.050
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.411
How are you?

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.567
Good, sir.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.366
<i>I got a strand of hair from his jacket.
I hope it's enough.</i>

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.051
Come on.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.161
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.527
Standing by for I.D.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.284
All units, setting condition orange.
Stand by.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.846
I don't take no for an answer.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.564
Almost there.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.280
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.522
Zartan?

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.009
Jaye, get out of there now.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.925
Oh, my God.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.481
We have an unauthorised I.D.
She's a Joe.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.568
We have a Joe on the premises.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.291
Jaye.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.120
Jaye, now.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.490
I'm out.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.285
<i>He's on his way down.
This is your only chance.</i>

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.841
Roger that, Jaye. I got it from here.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.331
Block? You only get one shot at this.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.365
One in the chamber.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.449
Block? Block, where are you?

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.810
I want to see that face.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.368
The one where you realise
today's the day.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.359
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.361
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.164
when I lit them all up like fireworks!

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.209
I really want to see that face.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.646
There it is.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.643
If Cobra and Zartan
are in the White House,

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.330
then the world is at stake.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.927
Storm Shadow.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.487
You will tell us Cobra's endgame,

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.810
or die

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.085
by the same sword you once
used to kill our master.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.527
Your sword,

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.564
given to you
by our beloved Hard Master.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.764
Do you deny that your envy and hatred
drove you to shed

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.163
the Hard Master's blood?

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.846
<i>It's possible to feel so much hate</i>

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.527
you stop feeling it at all.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.170
Like a fish not knowing it's in water.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.806
But my path was chosen for me

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.411
by my enemy

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.084
who framed me
for killing the Hard Master.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.010
And my friends

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.850
who believed it.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.643
Why defend yourself to men
too blind to see?

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.404
That is the Hard Master's blood.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.520
But that is not...

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.405
Wail!

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.731
...my sword.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.645
Arashikage steel does not break.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.246
I have asked myself over and over

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.803
who despised me enough
to destroy my life?

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.283
I am sorry, Storm Shadow.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.883
But who would stand to gain the most
by framing you for this crime?

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.681
Your young adversary
who chased you away?

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.687
Or the man into whose arms
you were chased.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.089
<i>Someone who welcomed you,</i>

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.530
<i>showed you kindness.</i>

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.367
<i>He needed me.</i>

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.490
For who I would become.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.207
A warrior of great skill and anger.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.210
<i>The man who betrayed me
was capable of great ingenuity,</i>

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.491
violence,

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.770
<i>but most of all,</i>

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.651
disguise.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.611
<i>Zartan.</i>

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.611
Yes.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.809
<i>Tell us what he and Cobra have planned</i>

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.845
<i>so we can destroy our common enemy</i>

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.760
together.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.601
Thanks.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.969
If my dad could see me now...

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.651
What are you talking about?

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.520
He wouldn't believe it.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.520
Why?

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.729
Third generation military.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.367
Desperately wanted a fourth, and

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.490
my mom had me.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.487
Well, he must be
real proud of you, then.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.048
He didn't believe in female soldiers.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.246
I finally asked him why. He said

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.564
he didn't want to put his life
in the hands of a woman.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.649
I enlisted the next day.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.247
Spent the next seven years

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.365
trying to outrank him
so he'd have to salute me.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.926
Did it work?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.129
He died before I got the chance.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.240
I'm sorry.

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:26.568
You know,
if it's any sod of a consolation,

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.131
I'm actually gonna miss the red.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.691
You look real nice.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.330
That was for the tax hike.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.404
Like you pay taxes.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.769
Ain't always about me.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.250
We still need the man.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.247
Besides, we've grown close.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.604
Is Storm Shadow in?

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.606
Don't you worry about him.
He'll be more than ready.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.208
I'm not too impressed with your Cabinet.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.807
No confirmation hearings,
that's what you get.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.685
Enough!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.804
I'll take it from here.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.643
He who controls this briefcase,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.526
controls the U.S. nuclear arsenal

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.125
and the fate of humanity.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.641
Open your eyes, Mr Ex-President.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.366
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.360
Open up.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.720
Zeus is ready.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.688
We just need
one final piece of the puzzle.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.882
Well done.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.804
History will stand in judgment.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.410
Not of me. Of you.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.086
What do we got, Jaye?

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.767
Zartan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.485
It has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.728
All right. Well, then that's our target.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.447
Yeah.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.530
Guys, move.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.924
I think I'm faster than you, Snake Eyes.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.130
Damn Ninjas.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.650
Good to see you, brother.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.121
Jaye.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.682
Jinx.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.160
Back up.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.527
He's with us.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.491
I am not with you.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.410
But for this once,

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.365
I am not against you.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.925
How many of our men has he killed?

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.010
We're supposed to fight with him?

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.841
The leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. It's a trap.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.003
Storm is the only one
who knows Cobra's plan

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.527
inside and out.
He can help us find a way to stop it.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.929
But we have to work together.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.921
All right.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.641
Let's move.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.609
Merry Christmas.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.449
Makes you wonder
about your neighbours.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.881
Nice.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.521
Open up that couch.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.325
Anything?

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.531
I brought my own.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.640
Nice.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.080
Yeah, that'll work.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.567
Hey.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.641
That one's mine.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.529
This really is Patton's gun, isn't it?

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.691
Gift from his family.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.761
What an honour.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.601
You bet.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.723
I was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.449
Try not to scratch her up.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.129
Idles a little rough in neutral.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.929
I ain't gonna be in neutral.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.880
Hoo-ah.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.125
What about you?

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.886
DOD says
I can't come out of retirement.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.161
They didn't say anything
about reenlisting.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.608
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.320
I'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.129
Colton's team, it's our honour.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.447
You guys take the perimeter.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.403
Flint, Jaye, Snake,
you guys take the flank.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.127
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.370
Zartan will be holding the briefcase.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.284
Storm will be the closest man to him.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.846
But he can't move
until we're all in position.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.565
Everyone keep your eye on the prize.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.839
We secure the football,
we secure the world.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.569
Snake, how's all that sound?

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.047
That's what I thought.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.082
Okay, wait. Hold on a second.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.802
We still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.121
Right?

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.287
These tanks survive, we don't.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.610
Leave the tanks to me.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.167
General?

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.327
Call me Joe.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.290
- Anything I missed?
- No.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.285
Rock solid. My orders?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.722
The President.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.409
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.081
Does Brenda get a vote?

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.325
Negative.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.967
You need a pen?

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.050
I need your help.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.961
All right.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.970
Let's kick that ass! Hoo-ah!

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.127
Hoo-ah!

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.324
<i>A historic day for the President
of the United States as he meets with...</i>

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.249
<i>This afternoon, the President
is meeting with the leaders</i>

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.691
<i>of the eight nuclear powers.</i>

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.484
<i>Never before
has a President been so bold</i>

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.848
<i>to call the leaders
of the world together...</i>

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.564
<i>These are unprecedented nuclear talks</i>

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.728
<i>that, frankly, most believed
would never happen.</i>

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.606
<i>You can bet security is at its highest...</i>

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.760
<i>We may be closer to a nuclear-free
world than we have ever been.</i>

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.531
I'll say it again.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.246
The world is safer
with a nuclear presence.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.684
I'm sure your electorate will be happy
by our final proposal.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.283
50% reduction by 2016.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.087
There are a lot of leaders in this room.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.004
But only one leader of the free world.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.760
And he,

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.488
I, stay with me,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.849
asked you here with the goal
of universal disarmament.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.407
Nuclear zero.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.160
Now, I was prepared
to cajole to get what I want.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.250
I'm now at threaten.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.450
Each of you will clear out
his nuclear closet immediately.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.845
Failure to participate
will be considered an act of war.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.925
You're joking, of course.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.451
This summit is over.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.561
Then this is it.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.161
This is it, boys.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.449
This country is at war.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.646
With you and you and you
and you and you and you.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.051
<i>Delta team in position.
Echo, you're a go.</i>

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.722
<i>This is Echo. Beginning assault.</i>

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.329
The U.S. nuclear arsenal

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.850
is capable of destroying
each of your countries 14 times over.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.850
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea,
just to be sure.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.930
And all

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.000
at the push

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.647
of a button.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.764
It's true. Yeah!

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.401
Yeah, I pressed it.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.847
You have lost your mind!

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.170
It's all relative.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.568
You got three minutes to decide.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.201
- You got next watch?
- Maintain radio silence.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.047
We cannot, we will not leave
a legacy of acquiescence!

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.765
Bring the briefcase.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.760
Don't do this!

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.411
There can be no winners!

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:02.927
High score.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.484
Let history record
who was responsible for this madness.

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.531
Launch.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.730
Launch.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.686
Eyes on the Emerald City.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.811
<i>Jaye and Colton,
you're a go for POTUS.</i>

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.282
You all right?

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.409
Yeah. You all right?

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.129
My cholesterol's a little high.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.288
<i>Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralised.</i>

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.165
You're on your own.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:40.400
Well, the good news is,
no global warming summit next month.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.920
Unless

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.284
one of us cared enough
about his place in history

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.007
to unilaterally disable his warheads.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.240
You know, in the name of the children.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.970
Any volunteers?

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.890
No? Fine.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.361
Me.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.922
Call your people to confirm.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.730
You're a complete lunatic.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.048
Says the man about to destroy Asia.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.771
Come on,
who's going to follow suit, huh?

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.249
Are you really going to stand by
and watch as Earth is destroyed?

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.601
Abort!

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.929
I figured North Korea for last.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.330
Got to love the little guy.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.240
Gentlemen.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.080
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:55.769
I want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.200
Now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.045
we call Project Zeus.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.569
There are seven Zeus satellites
orbiting Earth.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.567
<i>Each satellite contains
10 hollow platinum tubes</i>

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.649
<i>filled with a tungsten rod.</i>

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.162
Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.722
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorisation.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.330
Now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.647
We drop it!

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.007
Gravity does the rest.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.600
Observe.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.248
Satellite 1-A.
We have remote launch authorisation.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.169
Three, two, one,

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.521
drop.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.524
A rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.208
And with a force significantly greater
than a nuclear warhead.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.365
None of the fallout.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.810
All of the fun.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.322
You will have to answer for this.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.047
To your Congress, your courts.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.723
Correction,
they will have to answer to me.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.729
What is it you want?

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.289
I want it all.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.290
The Cobra revolution has begun.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.728
By pressing that button,
Zartan initiated an auto-drop sequence.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.406
My Zeus satellites
are moving into position

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.244
over your six remaining countries.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.286
Satellites 2-A through 7-A
en route to targets.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.726
The same button that begins this
can end it.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.289
But I only press it for a price.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.487
Total allegiance.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.290
<i>Block, secure the perimeter!</i>

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.571
Nothing matters now but the briefcase!
Keep it out of Joe hands!

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.086
Firefly has the case!

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.843
Head for the door, now! Go, go!

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.249
Satellites en route to targets.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.329
Beginning command protocols.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.449
<i>On your six, Cobra two!</i>

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.731
Cobra one, Cobra one,
I need eyes on! Eyes on!

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.329
Commander, I have the case.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.205
<i>We are still a go.</i>

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.970
How long till drop?

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.891
On schedule, Commander.
Five minutes to live fire.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.162
Final targeting to begin shortly.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.045
Zeus satellites 4 and 7 in position.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.650
- What was that?
- Shut up.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.400
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.931
Check the door. Give me a sit rep.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.007
I'm on it.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.966
You two secure the entrance.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.920
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. We're out of here.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.489
Stand down. I'm gonna shoot him!

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.891
I said stand down!

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.729
Be a good G.l. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.571
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.450
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.641
Drop it!

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.640
Easy, easy.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.886
Put some pressure on it.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.485
General Colton.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.480
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.369
- Sorry, Mr President.
- No, it's fine.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.920
Come on. Let's move.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.207
Here we go.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.041
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.562
<i>Roger that, Jaye.</i>

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.889
You betrayed the Hard Master.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.040
<i>And made me what I am.</i>

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.521
Yep.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.450
Yeah, I can see that was wrong.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.291
<i>We need eyes
on Firefly and Cobra ASAP.</i>

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.010
Courtyard clear. No sign of him.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.330
Zeus satellites 2, 3, 5, and 6
are locked on target. France,

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.166
Russia, North Korea,

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.444
<i>India, Israel, China.</i>

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.362
Block.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.480
<i>Cobra Commander's bugging out.</i>

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.880
No sign of Firefly.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.520
I've got him.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.607
Targets acquired.
Ordnance live and loading.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.288
Zeus 4 is ready to fire. Hatch is open.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.807
- Get him!
- Take him out!

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.004
You want that case?

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.089
You're gonna have to come through me.

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.891
Oh, yeah.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.122
That's right.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.885
<i>All satellites have begun load
for final countdown.</i>

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.400
<i>Launch codes confirmed.</i>

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.366
Ten seconds to live fire.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.842
<i>Ten.</i>

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.361
<i>Nine.</i>

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.800
<i>Eight.</i>

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.367
<i>Seven. Six.</i>
