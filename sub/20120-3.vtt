00:09.270 --> 00:09.940
Conny!

00:10.530 --> 00:12.150
Are there any survivors?

00:13.110 --> 00:14.180
No...

00:15.570 --> 00:17.120
None at all.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.650
It's all over...

00:20.290 --> 00:23.660
My hometown... It's gone forever.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.310
Hey! Something's strange here.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.470
Has anyone spotted any bodies?

00:38.720 --> 00:39.620
No...

00:40.220 --> 00:41.180
I haven't.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.559
How is that even possible?

00:43.560 --> 00:45.599
Titans come and not a single drop of blood?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.309
Everyone must've escaped!

00:47.310 --> 00:49.399
It means nobody here was eaten.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.940
Including your family, too.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.400
I see... That's gotta be it!

00:54.860 --> 01:00.280
Yeah. It's unbelievable to think Titans
ate everyone without leaving blood behind.

01:01.370 --> 01:03.360
That's not all that's unbelievable.

01:04.790 --> 01:08.060
If the entire village was really evacuated,

01:08.830 --> 01:14.030
why would Titans obliterate
these houses with nobody in them?

01:15.380 --> 01:19.050
But what really boggles
my mind is the stables.

01:20.470 --> 01:25.120
If they tried to escape without horses,
their chances of survival would be slim.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.030
Everyone got their torches?

01:28.600 --> 01:29.330
Let's move!

01:29.980 --> 01:33.069
Our mission now is to locate
and assess the breach in the wall!

01:33.070 --> 01:34.230
Yes, sir!

Just now...

02:05.350 --> 02:06.480
Conny, hurry up!

02:07.060 --> 02:08.560
We're falling behind Gerger!

02:09.979 --> 02:11.560
Reiner? Did you hear that?

02:12.190 --> 02:12.820
The Titan...

02:12.821 --> 02:14.770
I didn't hear anything at all.

02:15.710 --> 02:18.530
Enough with the chit-chat.
Focus on the mission!

02:19.070 --> 02:20.530
But it... I think...

02:21.410 --> 02:22.530
I don't know how, but...

02:23.160 --> 02:24.210
I think...

02:24.740 --> 02:25.620
My mom...

02:25.621 --> 02:29.070
Conny! Do you understand
the situation we're in?!

02:29.870 --> 02:34.280
Hundreds of thousands of lives depend
on whether we complete this mission or not!

02:34.880 --> 02:38.390
Your family might have escaped,
but it's not over yet!

02:38.920 --> 02:41.340
If you're a soldier, put the mission first!

02:45.470 --> 02:46.290
Yeah...

02:46.770 --> 02:48.000
Good point.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.150

04:36.830 --> 04:40.750
We're getting close to the wall now,
so there's no people living in the area.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.340
Right. That didn't take us very long.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.680
All right, let's head to the south.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.180
What for?

04:51.970 --> 04:54.690
There shouldn't be any
villages south of here.

04:55.310 --> 04:58.649
We need to find the location
the wall was breached.

04:58.650 --> 05:01.190
We'll ride along the wall
from the west until we find it.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.110
But Christa and I don't
have our battle gear.

05:05.650 --> 05:09.279
There's probably Titans
roaming everywhere to our south.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.200
It's very possible that
we'll become Titan fodder.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.530
Let the two of us withdraw from the front.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.620
Ymir...

05:17.621 --> 05:21.629
You can't. I'll need somebody
to relay back a report.

05:21.630 --> 05:25.560
I know how you feel,
but you signed up for this as a soldier.

05:31.970 --> 05:32.770
Ymir.

05:33.350 --> 05:35.640
I'm fine with putting my life on the line.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.630
After all, I'm the one
who chose to join the Scouts.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.190
But... it's not the same for you.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.239
The only reason you joined
the Scouts was because...

05:49.240 --> 05:52.160
Hmph! You think I did it for you?!

05:52.870 --> 05:54.830
Then why are you even here?

05:55.540 --> 05:58.920
You kept trying to convince me
to join the Military Police.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.090
But then you gave that privilege to me!

06:02.750 --> 06:06.930
There's no way I'm good enough
to make the top ten on skill alone.

06:07.550 --> 06:11.930
I'm sure if I asked anyone, they'd say
you deserved to be in it, not me.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.290
I don't know how you did it, but...

06:16.680 --> 06:17.350
Why?

06:18.270 --> 06:19.880
Why would you go that far for me?

06:24.570 --> 06:25.570
Does it...

06:27.280 --> 06:29.290
...have to do with my family?

06:31.780 --> 06:33.950
Yeah, it does.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.310
Christa...

06:38.040 --> 06:39.460
Don't worry about it.

06:40.460 --> 06:44.710
The only reason I'm here...
is for myself and nothing else.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
I see...

06:51.800 --> 06:52.910
Thank goodness.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.750
Not yet! Wait for the order!

07:16.490 --> 07:17.330
Sir!

07:18.160 --> 07:20.080
Fire!

07:39.770 --> 07:40.540
Did I get 'em?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.439
You did it, Captain Rico!

07:44.440 --> 07:47.939
At this rate, they'll
never break our defense!

07:47.940 --> 07:51.510
No... The Titans' strength
is in their numbers.

07:51.990 --> 07:55.570
If they attack as a group,
this line won't stand a chance.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.380
But... what is it?

07:59.950 --> 08:00.980
Something isn't...

08:02.830 --> 08:03.990
This is strange...

08:04.540 --> 08:06.710
Captain Hannes! Is something wrong?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.380
We haven't even spotted a single Titan yet.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.130
We've got to be getting
close to the hole now.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.540
And yet, doesn't it seem
awful quiet around here?

08:21.100 --> 08:25.880
Hopefully, we can sneak in and out
without stirring up a storm.

"Southern Team"

08:47.920 --> 08:48.840

08:50.800 --> 08:52.210
When will they show?

08:53.920 --> 08:55.430
When will it happen?

08:56.220 --> 08:59.540
At any second, they could
leap out from the shadows.

09:01.770 --> 09:02.560
No...

09:03.560 --> 09:08.680
The closer we get to the hole,
the more inevitable it becomes.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.820
Damn it!

09:12.570 --> 09:14.570
This is driving me crazy!

09:40.050 --> 09:43.019
Did you follow the wall here, too?

09:43.020 --> 09:45.600
Yeah. Where did you find the hole?

09:45.980 --> 09:46.850
Huh?

09:47.980 --> 09:50.570
We didn't find anything to the west.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.360
Didn't you find it your way?

09:54.470 --> 09:55.360
No...

09:56.860 --> 09:58.590
There's no hole this way either.

10:05.450 --> 10:07.040
Is it possible we missed it?

10:07.330 --> 10:08.130
No way.

10:08.790 --> 10:11.040
Not a hole big enough for Titans to use.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.050
Should we go back and look again?

10:14.590 --> 10:19.310
We'll need to, but the horses
and the rest of us are exhausted.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.500
If only we had some moonlight...

10:24.560 --> 10:25.190
Yeah...

10:28.770 --> 10:29.610
What's that?

10:34.980 --> 10:36.440
Castle ruins?

10:54.250 --> 10:58.420
It looks like a mess, but we can
make it work for one night of rest.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.420
Right. Luckily the moon is out.

11:11.810 --> 11:12.690
Hange.

11:14.820 --> 11:16.290
Hey, four-eyes.

11:17.740 --> 11:21.450
Are your hobbies so boring that playing
with rocks is somehow fun for you?

11:22.450 --> 11:24.450
Yeah. That's right.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.990
But this is no ordinary rock.

11:27.490 --> 11:30.960
It's a hardened fragment of skin
left behind by the Female Titan.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.460
Huh? It didn't disappear?

11:33.830 --> 11:36.577
Right! Annie reverted
from a Titan, but it's still

11:36.602 --> 11:38.839
intact even though it
broke off her body.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.670
It didn't evaporate. It didn't disappear.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.599
So I thought, "What if?"

11:44.600 --> 11:46.679
When I compared it to a piece of the wall,

11:46.680 --> 11:50.600
its pattern and composition
were practically identical.

11:51.140 --> 11:54.729
In other words, the wall is
a barricade of humongous Titans.

11:54.730 --> 11:59.740
And if I'm right, the surface is
constructed with hardened Titan skin.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.780
That's exactly what Armin was saying...

12:05.740 --> 12:06.740
Th-Then...

12:07.660 --> 12:09.910
Let me finish, Armin.

12:10.540 --> 12:14.170
As it stands, we'll be hard pressed
to fill the hole in Wall Rose.

12:14.830 --> 12:18.340
That is, unless we can find
the perfect boulder to plug it.

12:19.590 --> 12:22.800
But if... But if Eren,
in his transformed state,

12:23.590 --> 12:27.940
could use the Titans' hardening ability
to seal the hole in the wall...

12:29.600 --> 12:30.630
Use me...

12:32.270 --> 12:34.020
...to seal the wall?

12:35.690 --> 12:38.479
It should be made of the same material.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.695
And seeing how the hardened
section won't

12:40.720 --> 12:43.304
evaporate, even after you
revert from a Titan...

12:44.320 --> 12:45.610
...it's possible...

12:49.450 --> 12:52.080
I think it's well worth the risk to try.

12:52.710 --> 12:57.920
And assuming it really does work,
reclaiming Wall Maria is feasible, too.

12:59.090 --> 13:03.589
Up until now, we've had to transport
a large quantity of materials and supplies.

13:03.590 --> 13:07.220
That's why the need for outposts
past the wall limited our progress.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.429
But if we don't have to
accommodate supply wagons...

13:11.430 --> 13:13.730
...we could quickly make
our way to Shiganshina.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.360
What if we carried out the plan at night?

13:17.810 --> 13:18.770
At night?

13:18.771 --> 13:19.859
Yes.

13:19.860 --> 13:21.730
During the night, when Titans can't move.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.859
I see...

13:24.860 --> 13:29.010
If the group was small enough,
you could sneak all the way to Wall Maria.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.749
The current situation is
as bad as it gets, but...

13:33.750 --> 13:36.470
...we still have a glimmer of hope.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.750
Yes, but remember...

13:40.380 --> 13:43.510
...it all depends on whether Eren
can seal the hole or not.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.510
I realize asking this
hardly seems fair, but...

13:49.640 --> 13:51.010
Think you can do it?

14:00.800 --> 14:03.160
It doesn't matter what you think.

14:04.430 --> 14:07.280
You have to. There's no other choice.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.150
We're out of options.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.680
Our forces are struggling so desperately,
there's nothing else they can do.

14:14.790 --> 14:16.520
You have to succeed.

14:17.230 --> 14:17.960
I will!

14:18.330 --> 14:21.210
I'll do whatever it takes to seal the wall!

14:22.460 --> 14:23.500
Whatever it takes...

14:31.470 --> 14:32.380
The basement...

14:32.970 --> 14:34.560
My dad's basement...

14:35.350 --> 14:40.560
If what my dad said was true,
we'll find the answers to everything there.

14:48.610 --> 14:49.660
It's Ehrmich District.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.879
Hey, keep moving.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.540
You'll end up like a little lost kid.

15:08.470 --> 15:09.780
Th-This is...

15:10.590 --> 15:12.680
What did you expect you'd see?

15:13.970 --> 15:16.460
This is what happens when the wall falls.

15:18.560 --> 15:22.100
Mommy! Daddy!

15:24.150 --> 15:24.910
Hey!

15:25.820 --> 15:27.110
Where do you think you're going?

15:28.320 --> 15:32.110
Take a good look at the faces of people
who've lost everything.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.120
The faces of everyone you
and your people abandoned.

15:37.240 --> 15:42.100
If your church's wish comes true,
and Titans come flooding through the walls,

15:42.750 --> 15:46.180
we'll all be gobbled
up in their stinking mouths

15:46.205 --> 15:49.284
and die in the most miserable
way possible.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.240
All of humanity, digested as one.

15:56.310 --> 15:59.430
Once we leave Ehrmich,
we'll be in Titan territory.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.849
Eren? Think you can ride a horse?

16:02.850 --> 16:06.149
Yes. I feel fully recovered now.

16:06.150 --> 16:09.440
Yours is ready at the west lift.
Let's hurry.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.369
Section Commander. We should hurry.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.280
Give me a minute, Moblit.

16:18.820 --> 16:21.460
Have you had a change of heart yet?

16:26.750 --> 16:29.339
We don't have time for this!
You know, don't you?!

16:29.340 --> 16:32.470
Will you talk, or won't you?!
Make up your mind already!

16:34.220 --> 16:35.960
I cannot say anything.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.610
The other believers are the same as I,
and that will never change.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.269
Well thanks for nothing!

16:43.270 --> 16:46.559
We're so grateful for all
the help you've been!

16:46.560 --> 16:51.560
It's too great a decision
for a single person to make.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.084
...The Order of the Walls
must always adhere

16:54.109 --> 16:55.279
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

16:55.280 --> 16:55.684
- ... This way.
- ... The Order of the Walls must

16:55.709 --> 16:56.120
always adhere to the sacred
will we're bound to obey.

16:56.123 --> 16:57.798
-Sir! Thank you!
- ...The Order of the Walls must

16:57.823 --> 16:57.854
always adhere to the sacred
will we're bound to obey.

16:58.330 --> 16:59.630
Whose will?

17:00.450 --> 17:01.659
God or something?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.650
I cannot say anything.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.170
However,

17:05.171 --> 17:12.200
I can inform you of a name, who under their
sacred will, we were instructed to monitor.

17:12.589 --> 17:13.670
Monitor?

17:15.720 --> 17:19.680
That person joined the Scout
Regiment as of this year.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.099
Their name is...

17:24.770 --> 17:25.890
Excuse me!

17:26.440 --> 17:28.519
104th Cadet Corps!

17:28.520 --> 17:29.820
Sasha Braus!

17:31.780 --> 17:33.070
Her?

17:33.570 --> 17:34.530
Who's that?

17:34.531 --> 17:37.199
Um, this is for you, Section Commander.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.829
You must find her at once.

17:39.830 --> 17:44.960
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.240
That is all the information I can share.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.210
The rest I leave in your hands.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.590
If she's in the 104th, then she's deep
in the front lines right now.

17:57.050 --> 17:58.509
Let's go!

17:58.510 --> 17:59.740
We need to hurry!

18:00.390 --> 18:01.350
Wait!

18:01.640 --> 18:02.540
Ouch...

18:03.180 --> 18:04.110
Sasha?!

18:04.980 --> 18:06.650
What are you doing here?

18:09.770 --> 18:13.069
Upon my arrival, I gave my report
to the Commander!

18:13.070 --> 18:16.490
Afterwards, I was entrusted to deliver
this message to the Section Commander!

18:17.110 --> 18:20.880
Message? Thank you. Good work.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.619
So, who is this girl in the 104th?

18:26.620 --> 18:28.880
She's the smallest one of us.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.669
She's got long golden hair.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.990
Um, and...

18:34.840 --> 18:35.590
She's cute.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.590
She's always hanging around Ymir.

18:41.260 --> 18:42.510
Ymir?

18:45.520 --> 18:46.990
What's the meaning of this?

18:49.000 --> 18:49.920
Ymir...

18:51.980 --> 18:52.980
You...

18:55.320 --> 18:56.440
Everyone, wake up!

18:56.780 --> 18:59.230
Get to the tower! Quickly!

19:08.160 --> 19:11.000
I couldn't see them in the darkness,
but then the moon...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.910
Why? Why can they move?

19:17.510 --> 19:19.720
It's been so long since the sun set!

19:21.090 --> 19:22.330
What's going on here?

19:22.930 --> 19:25.220
Hey! Look at that!

19:26.520 --> 19:29.770
It's huge! What the hell is it? A Titan?

19:30.850 --> 19:32.730
No, it's more like...

19:33.190 --> 19:34.560
It's like a beast!

19:35.520 --> 19:36.410
Right?

19:41.110 --> 19:43.470
It's... headed for the wall!

19:50.660 --> 19:52.369
Everyone understand?

19:52.370 --> 19:53.000
Yes!

19:54.630 --> 19:55.709
We've got to go!

19:55.710 --> 19:57.000
Calm down, Eren.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.270
You all listen, too.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.259
We're going our own ways now.

20:03.260 --> 20:04.550
The rest is up to you.

20:05.640 --> 20:10.890
Erwin may have thrown together your squad,
but everything's riding on you.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.559
Got it, Armin?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.150
Work with Hange and combine your knowledge.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.690
Y-Yes sir!

20:18.610 --> 20:19.370
Mikasa.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.700
I don't know why you're
so attached to Eren, but...

20:23.610 --> 20:27.200
...use the utmost of your ability
to protect Eren at all costs.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.340
Yes, sir! Of course!

20:30.080 --> 20:31.210
And finally...

20:32.410 --> 20:33.080
Eren.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.340
Hey, wait!

20:39.960 --> 20:41.730
Wait, wait, wait up!

20:43.090 --> 20:44.760
Don't you be coming in here!

20:45.720 --> 20:49.849
You're fricking kidding me.
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

20:49.850 --> 20:52.639
I'd be drinking right now
if it wasn't for you!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.520
This is all your fault!

20:54.850 --> 20:56.560
Stand back, rookies.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.230
Leave it to us.

21:00.230 --> 21:02.400
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.070
Let's go!

21:24.010 --> 21:25.650
And finally, Eren.

21:26.470 --> 21:28.430
Learn how to restrain yourself.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.460
Don't succumb to rage
and lose sight of the goal.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.310
We can't afford another mistake.

21:36.010 --> 21:36.740
Yes, sir!

21:39.610 --> 21:42.380
There's a tower nearby
where we can assess the wall.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.780
It's in an abandoned
castle to the southwest.

21:46.950 --> 21:49.160
We'll ride to Utgard Castle.
