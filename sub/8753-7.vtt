00:10.730 --> 00:12.764
The guy in the black is bad.

00:12.766 --> 00:14.099
He's always been bad.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.955
I became obsessed with this place.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.020
They think I'm insane.

00:17.022 --> 00:19.555
He can induce fear.

00:19.557 --> 00:22.525
Her attachment to the
place is a little spooky.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.527
61-year-old male who hung himself

00:24.529 --> 00:25.896
with a belt in the closet.

00:25.898 --> 00:26.896
Oh, my God.

00:26.898 --> 00:28.631
I never say I own the place.

00:28.633 --> 00:29.966
I say the place owns me.

00:29.968 --> 00:33.103
They're saying,
"Can't you get us out of here?"

00:33.105 --> 00:37.307
I think that he harmed many women.

00:37.309 --> 00:40.143
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:40.145 --> 00:42.479
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.481 --> 00:45.381
What's happening?

00:45.383 --> 00:46.482
I see dead people.

00:46.484 --> 00:48.919
It seems like a devil.

00:48.921 --> 00:50.620
I speak to dead people.

00:50.622 --> 00:52.289
He's pissed off.

00:52.291 --> 00:53.723
And they speak to me.

00:53.725 --> 00:55.858
I felt real fear.

00:55.860 --> 00:58.828
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.831
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.432
I rely on my partner.

01:02.434 --> 01:04.034
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:04.036 --> 01:06.569
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:06.571 --> 01:07.804
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.806 --> 01:11.007
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.009 --> 01:12.208
Nobody believes me.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.676
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.946
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.948 --> 01:17.680
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.682 --> 01:19.716
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.718 --> 01:20.950
Until the very end.

01:20.952 --> 01:22.685
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.687 --> 01:24.888
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.890 --> 01:26.956
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:26.958 --> 01:28.225
Or time to get out.

01:28.227 --> 01:31.294
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:51.515 --> 01:53.283
I'm in Santa Paula, California.

01:53.285 --> 01:55.651
It's about an hour North of Los Angeles.

01:55.653 --> 01:59.389
I got a call from a
19-year-old named Gabriella.

01:59.391 --> 02:02.225
She tells me her parents, Rosanna and Tom,

02:02.227 --> 02:04.560
live in and run a historic hotel.

02:04.562 --> 02:07.330
Gabriella says the activity there is so bad

02:07.332 --> 02:09.566
she won't step foot in the place.

02:09.568 --> 02:13.603
She even sent me a video
that's got me really concerned.

02:13.605 --> 02:15.906
<i>It just only hurt our
family by owning this hotel.</i>

02:15.908 --> 02:19.376
<i>It has this very negative, dark energy.</i>

02:19.378 --> 02:21.477
<i>I really worry about their mental health.</i>

02:21.479 --> 02:25.048
<i>It just really freaks me out.</i>

02:25.050 --> 02:27.149
I reached out to Tom and Rosanna,

02:27.151 --> 02:29.685
who agree the hotel is
ripping their family apart.

02:29.687 --> 02:32.188
They say if we can't help them,
they may lose everything.

02:44.035 --> 02:46.969
Before Amy arrives,
I look for anything

02:46.971 --> 02:49.605
that might influence her findings.

02:49.607 --> 02:52.775
This hotel has a lot of
artwork and historic photos

02:52.777 --> 02:55.111
that have to be covered or removed.

02:55.113 --> 02:57.780
When I'm finished,

02:57.782 --> 03:01.051
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

03:15.299 --> 03:20.570
During my opening, I saw a cemetery.

03:20.572 --> 03:24.206
There are adults crying... men and women.

03:24.208 --> 03:27.009
There are about a dozen
little wooden crosses.

03:27.011 --> 03:30.680
And I hear, "The children all died."

03:43.962 --> 03:46.296
I feel really sick.

03:46.298 --> 03:48.798
Like, I can't, like, breathe.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.167
I think there's something in the air.

03:51.169 --> 03:53.303
There's something in the air.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.641
Oh, boy.

03:58.643 --> 04:01.378
This is not good.

04:15.292 --> 04:18.027
Rosanna, your daughter Gabriella
got in touch with me,

04:18.029 --> 04:20.762
and she's really concerned
about what's happening here

04:20.765 --> 04:23.233
and what happened to the family.

04:23.235 --> 04:24.834
Gabriella has always voiced the fact

04:24.836 --> 04:27.203
that ever since we bought the place,

04:27.205 --> 04:29.439
she feels like she lost her parents.

04:29.441 --> 04:31.074
Okay, so, do you think she's right?

04:31.076 --> 04:32.275
Yeah, she's right.

04:32.277 --> 04:33.776
Okay.

04:33.778 --> 04:35.445
10 years ago, I came here

04:35.447 --> 04:38.381
and I saw this building that was beautiful.

04:38.383 --> 04:40.917
But it was in such disrepair,
I told my husband,

04:40.919 --> 04:43.086
"Let's do something about this building.

04:43.088 --> 04:44.621
This building needs help."

04:44.623 --> 04:46.423
So, I convinced my family.

04:46.425 --> 04:48.524
It was my idea, my project.

04:48.526 --> 04:51.527
And my family really resents that.

04:51.529 --> 04:53.530
I became obsessed.

04:53.532 --> 04:54.864
Geez.

04:54.866 --> 04:57.734
Now, who exactly lives here?

04:57.736 --> 05:00.403
This is my daughter Aisha,

05:00.405 --> 05:03.005
my husband, Tom, and there's myself.

05:03.007 --> 05:04.974
Gabriella's in New York.

05:04.976 --> 05:05.975
New York, yes.

05:05.977 --> 05:08.411
And this is our home in Malibu.

05:08.413 --> 05:12.081
We had the most beautiful, spacious home

05:12.083 --> 05:15.451
on an acre overlooking the
most beautiful beaches.

05:15.453 --> 05:18.287
- So, this is where you lived before?
- Yes.

05:18.289 --> 05:20.523
And I understand you still own it,
but you rent it out.

05:20.525 --> 05:22.592
- Yes, we do.
- And how long have you guys been here?

05:22.594 --> 05:23.993
Six months.

05:23.995 --> 05:25.795
So, if you wanted to go back there,

05:25.797 --> 05:26.896
you can go back there.

05:26.898 --> 05:28.264
I don't want to be rude,

05:28.266 --> 05:29.766
but I think you're a little insane, myself.

05:29.768 --> 05:32.535
I don't have the strength
and confidence to leave.

05:32.537 --> 05:35.871
I think this place needs me.

05:35.873 --> 05:36.939
At the same time,

05:36.941 --> 05:39.208
it's destroying your family dynamics.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.277
Yes. I'm very torn.

05:42.479 --> 05:44.614
What's some of the overall things

05:44.616 --> 05:46.516
that people are experiencing?

05:46.518 --> 05:48.551
We get people that wake up
in the middle of the night

05:48.553 --> 05:49.952
saying that they can't sleep here

05:49.954 --> 05:51.888
because they feel that their bodies

05:51.890 --> 05:53.590
are being pulled to the floor.

05:53.592 --> 05:55.758
Contractors running downstairs and saying,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.860
"We just saw these children
running down the hall

05:57.862 --> 05:59.329
and then they went into a wall."

05:59.331 --> 06:03.633
There are people who hear
their names being whispered,

06:03.635 --> 06:05.101
like, "Steve."

06:05.103 --> 06:06.235
Wow.

06:06.237 --> 06:10.640
But also, people are jumpy... more anxiety.

06:10.642 --> 06:14.210
And the intensity between my
husband and myself increased.

06:14.212 --> 06:17.213
Everybody's, like, ready to snap.

06:17.215 --> 06:19.149
How's your relationship
when you're not here?

06:19.151 --> 06:20.283
Much happier.

06:20.285 --> 06:22.685
So, why don't we just move out of the hotel?

06:22.687 --> 06:25.688
I'm, you know, scared to leave it

06:25.690 --> 06:27.690
because I don't know what would happen

06:27.692 --> 06:31.027
if I ever thought of
selling it or leaving it.

06:31.029 --> 06:33.429
How would it punish me?

06:42.038 --> 06:44.641
There's something here that I don't like.

06:44.643 --> 06:49.145
It's kind of making me anxious.

06:49.147 --> 06:52.248
Like, that kind of
rock-in-your-stomach feeling.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.718
Like, the fear is just disgusting.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.520
Like I'm stressed out.

06:57.522 --> 06:59.555
I feel very stressed out.

06:59.557 --> 07:03.459
I feel like something bad's going to happen.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.836
I've been resistant to coming up here.

07:13.838 --> 07:16.239
I get a creepy feeling here.

07:16.241 --> 07:19.775
I can't even send my employees
up here by themselves to clean.

07:19.777 --> 07:22.745
I always have to assign two
or with the maintenance guy.

07:22.747 --> 07:25.415
- I mean, they just won't do it by themselves.
- Okay.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.750
Now, this doesn't look renovated.

07:27.752 --> 07:29.319
Eight years ago.

07:29.321 --> 07:31.421
This was the last floor
that we were finishing up.

07:31.423 --> 07:34.624
And we put this place up on the market.

07:34.626 --> 07:36.526
- Okay.
- We did that a lot.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.494
We renovated buildings and
then put them on the market.

07:38.496 --> 07:40.330
My husband and I went on a trip.

07:40.332 --> 07:43.866
And when we were on this trip,
we got the call from hell

07:43.868 --> 07:46.969
saying that, "Your building is on fire

07:46.971 --> 07:49.372
and we don't know if we're
gonna be able to save it."

07:51.441 --> 07:53.109
Oh.

07:53.111 --> 07:54.777
Wow.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.278
It was just growing all over.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.980
It was right about this area.

07:59.350 --> 08:00.783
Anybody get hurt?

08:00.785 --> 08:03.118
Nobody got hurt, thank God.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.888
Now,
what makes you think this is paranormal?

08:05.890 --> 08:07.923
This is the irony of the whole thing.

08:07.925 --> 08:11.260
The fire was exactly $1.3 million of damage

08:11.262 --> 08:14.497
and we were insured $1.3 million.

08:15.432 --> 08:19.302
Like, it's trying to say to you,
"Hey, don't go anywhere."

08:19.304 --> 08:20.870
Now you know why I have PTSD

08:20.872 --> 08:23.038
from thinking about
putting it on the market.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.241
This place has abandonment issues.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.142
It doesn't let me go.

08:27.144 --> 08:29.011
Okay.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.894
Someone's yelling.

08:44.896 --> 08:48.097
Someone... some female's saying,

08:48.099 --> 08:51.000
"Oh, can't you get us out of here?

08:51.002 --> 08:52.402
Can't you get us out of here?"

08:57.107 --> 08:58.408
People running.

08:58.410 --> 09:00.209
There's people running.

09:01.580 --> 09:05.848
There was something like a
fire or something because,

09:05.850 --> 09:09.518
um... you know,
there was a bunch of people here

09:09.520 --> 09:12.722
and then they're all trying

09:12.724 --> 09:16.392
to get out as quickly as possible.

09:27.738 --> 09:29.739
You describe how this place

09:29.741 --> 09:32.074
emotionally changes you when you come in

09:32.076 --> 09:34.577
and how, basically, you're obsessed with it.

09:34.579 --> 09:38.581
But have you ever had an
actual paranormal experience?

09:38.583 --> 09:41.551
Well, there was one time
when I was going to a room.

09:41.553 --> 09:43.119
And I was gonna use the restroom.

09:43.121 --> 09:46.055
And it was in an area that was isolated.

09:46.057 --> 09:48.590
And as I closed the door,

09:48.592 --> 09:52.395
I noticed that the doorknob had moved.

09:54.464 --> 09:55.598
I thought for a second

09:55.600 --> 09:57.232
maybe my husband was trying to scare me.

09:57.234 --> 10:00.335
Then the doorknob fell to the floor.

10:00.337 --> 10:02.605
And I thought, "Oh, my God."

10:02.607 --> 10:05.608
I started hitting the
door and yelling for help.

10:05.610 --> 10:09.244
I became like a crazy, psychotic woman.

10:09.246 --> 10:10.580
And how long were you stuck?

10:10.582 --> 10:11.714
About a half an hour.

10:11.716 --> 10:15.084
They found me just devastated, just sobbing.

10:15.086 --> 10:17.186
Okay. Now, it's an old building.

10:17.188 --> 10:19.722
So you sure the doorknob just didn't,
like, fall out?

10:19.724 --> 10:21.423
Well, I understand what you mean.

10:21.425 --> 10:22.925
But I saw the doorknob move.

10:22.927 --> 10:26.662
This place is telling me who's in control,

10:26.664 --> 10:28.964
that there was an energy or presence there

10:28.966 --> 10:31.768
that I had to respect,
and that they were in control.

10:31.770 --> 10:33.736
And that's why I never say I own the place.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.437
I say the place owns me.

10:35.439 --> 10:37.039
And you really believe that.

10:37.041 --> 10:38.040
Mm-hmm.

10:38.042 --> 10:40.009
'Cause there is something here.

10:40.011 --> 10:41.511
Okay.

10:45.548 --> 10:48.650
I see this guy
walking down the hallway.

10:48.652 --> 10:51.487
He wears all black.

10:51.489 --> 10:53.556
Yeah, ooh.

10:53.558 --> 10:55.558
Ooh [bleep] me.

10:55.560 --> 10:59.862
Yeah, he doesn't like women, for sure.

11:02.265 --> 11:05.100
Yeah, the guy in the black is bad.

11:05.102 --> 11:07.970
He's always been bad.

11:07.972 --> 11:10.473
He definitely is saying, you know,

11:10.475 --> 11:13.409
that he's dealt with women like me before.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.379
What does that mean?

11:16.381 --> 11:18.480
He's like, "I've taken those [bleep] out."

11:41.626 --> 11:44.027
Well, Tom, I was talking to your wife

11:44.029 --> 11:46.529
and she explained what's going on here.

11:46.531 --> 11:51.501
You went from oceanfront
Malibu beach house to this.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.802
It's night and day.

11:52.804 --> 11:55.671
I mean, it is culture shock moving here

11:55.673 --> 11:58.274
and moving to this
environment and this dwelling.

11:58.276 --> 12:01.677
She also mentioned she's become
obsessed with this place.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.879
Would you agree with that?

12:02.881 --> 12:04.147
Yeah, it's one of the few things

12:04.149 --> 12:05.849
that she says that I'll
agree with completely.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.685
I'm surprised she admitted that.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.855
Her attachment to the
place is a little spooky.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.489
Do you believe in this stuff at all?

12:14.726 --> 12:16.026
The answer is, I didn't.

12:17.562 --> 12:20.263
- Have you had any experience at all?
- I've had experiences.

12:20.265 --> 12:21.931
What have you experienced?

12:21.933 --> 12:24.267
- Well, there's two distinct episodes.
- Okay.

12:24.269 --> 12:26.770
The first one is I was brushing my teeth

12:26.772 --> 12:28.804
and behind me, right here,

12:28.806 --> 12:33.142
I heard somebody make this really weird,
menacing sound.

12:33.144 --> 12:35.712
- So, I just whip around. There's nobody there.
- Right.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.546
I ran. I had the toothbrush in my hand.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.415
I had toothpaste dripping down my mouth.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.785
I ran into the bedroom where Rosanna was.

12:41.787 --> 12:43.053
It takes a lot to freak me out like that.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.088
Tom, you said you had two incidents.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.389
What was the second one?

12:46.391 --> 12:48.992
One of the doors to an
upstairs room was locked.

12:48.994 --> 12:50.293
And this was a room

12:50.295 --> 12:52.461
that was not supposed to
be occupied by any guest.

12:52.463 --> 12:54.798
The door was locked from inside.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.466
We're concerned.
We're thinking there's a guy in the room.

12:56.468 --> 12:57.834
He's not supposed to be there.
He's a stranger.

12:57.836 --> 12:59.335
What's going on there?

12:59.337 --> 13:01.938
I removed the door.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.740
And I look around.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.542
Nobody's in the closet.
Nobody's in the bathroom.

13:05.544 --> 13:07.977
And the windows were locked from the inside.

13:07.979 --> 13:10.113
I'm freaking out.

13:10.115 --> 13:11.314
I start looking in vents.

13:11.316 --> 13:12.982
There's an air conditioning vent,

13:12.984 --> 13:14.217
but it's like this.

13:14.219 --> 13:15.485
Check under the bed?

13:15.487 --> 13:16.886
Yeah, looking under the bed,
but there's not even spaces.

13:16.888 --> 13:17.954
There's nothing over there.

13:17.956 --> 13:19.956
Everything's locked from the inside.

13:19.958 --> 13:23.259
And that, to me, was even more eerie

13:23.261 --> 13:25.228
than the thing that happened to me directly.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.630
And if somebody says,
"Do you believe in ghosts?"

13:27.632 --> 13:32.468
all I can say is, "Hey,
these things happened to me

13:32.470 --> 13:33.569
and I can't explain them."

13:33.571 --> 13:34.670
Do you think it's dangerous?

13:34.672 --> 13:36.405
I think it could be. I think it's potent.

13:39.176 --> 13:42.178
The guy in the black,
he's very physical.

13:45.149 --> 13:46.849
Always, like, messing with people,

13:46.851 --> 13:49.285
like, touching, touching, touching.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.320
It's very distracting, very annoying,

13:51.322 --> 13:53.723
and I'm sure very
frightening for many people.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.394
Hmm.

13:58.396 --> 14:00.730
Yeah, I think this is him

14:00.732 --> 14:06.502
because I feel that same...
weight, that same fear.

14:06.504 --> 14:08.939
Now I know what made me so anxious

14:08.941 --> 14:11.441
when I first walked into the hotel.

14:11.443 --> 14:12.942
It's this man in black.

14:12.944 --> 14:15.178
His presence terrifies the living

14:15.180 --> 14:17.380
and he enjoys watching them suffer.

14:17.382 --> 14:22.152
He definitely knows how to induce fear.

14:22.154 --> 14:25.155
He's saying that he can really harm people.

14:33.097 --> 14:34.897
Aisha, your mom feels

14:34.899 --> 14:37.933
that you guys are really upset with her.

14:37.935 --> 14:40.636
We are.

14:40.638 --> 14:42.305
She's obsessed.

14:42.307 --> 14:45.641
The dynamic of the family
was very much disrupted.

14:45.643 --> 14:47.611
I almost felt like she loved this place

14:47.613 --> 14:48.778
more than me at one point.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.880
So, you're living here for how long?

14:50.882 --> 14:52.915
On and off for like 10 years.

14:52.917 --> 14:55.351
Why'd you bring me into
this particular room?

14:55.353 --> 14:56.753
Well, out of all the rooms,

14:56.755 --> 14:59.188
I would say this is
probably the most active.

14:59.190 --> 15:04.127
Recently, the curtains just started moving.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.495
There was no wind.

15:05.497 --> 15:07.030
The window wasn't open.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.097
You have A/C in the room?

15:08.099 --> 15:10.166
We do, but it wasn't on at the time.

15:10.168 --> 15:13.403
And it was like 2:00 a.m.,
no A/C, windows closed,

15:13.405 --> 15:17.373
and I look over and the curtains
are just dancing back and forth.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.242
Okay, was it a windy night,
anything like that?

15:19.244 --> 15:21.310
- Maybe a draft underneath the windows?
- No, no, no.

15:21.312 --> 15:22.978
Now, let me ask you a question.

15:22.980 --> 15:24.814
Would you stay in this place alone?

15:24.816 --> 15:26.115
No, I couldn't.

15:26.117 --> 15:28.751
This room specifically, there's an entity

15:28.753 --> 15:31.221
that I think doesn't like
it when there's people here.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.156
It's kind of like invading its territory.

15:41.098 --> 15:43.366
The one tall, dark guy, like,

15:43.368 --> 15:46.769
he doesn't want us to be in here
'cause this is his pad.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.975
He doesn't like it when people are in here.

15:52.977 --> 15:53.977
What does he do?

15:53.979 --> 15:56.946
He makes it, like, weird, like,

15:56.948 --> 16:00.516
loud and disturbing and shocking.

16:00.518 --> 16:02.318
He's crazy.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.920
So, I'm thinking, like,
the TV comes on full blast

16:04.922 --> 16:07.857
or, like, an alarm goes off.

16:07.859 --> 16:09.225
"Just get them out."

16:09.227 --> 16:12.428
He's constantly touching me,
so I don't like that.

16:18.069 --> 16:22.238
He's showing me, like,
he actually can hit people.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.109
I see, like, he's choking women.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.944
You know,
like I'm seeing this woman laying in a bed

16:28.946 --> 16:31.414
and he's pinning her down

16:31.416 --> 16:35.618
and he's, like,
punching her across the face.

16:48.688 --> 16:50.867
I didn't think I'd have much trouble

16:50.967 --> 16:53.133
digging up history on
an old hotel like this,

16:53.135 --> 16:55.002
so I reached out to a local historian.

16:55.004 --> 16:57.304
And she gave me more than I bargained for.

16:57.306 --> 17:00.407
She says Tom and Rosanna's property

17:00.409 --> 17:02.743
was the scene of a brutal murder.

17:10.185 --> 17:12.352
Mary Alice,
you mentioned on the phone when we spoke

17:12.354 --> 17:14.288
that there was a violent incident

17:14.290 --> 17:16.890
that took place before
the hotel was even built.

17:16.892 --> 17:18.025
Yes.

17:18.027 --> 17:20.994
There had been a shooting on Main Street

17:20.997 --> 17:24.364
which had been initiated
by this outlaw Joe Dye

17:24.366 --> 17:30.237
who challenged a man for
having an affair with his wife.

17:30.239 --> 17:31.738
The man's name was Herman Haines.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.008
Joe Dye actually shot Herman Haines

17:34.010 --> 17:37.444
on Main Street in 1886.

17:37.446 --> 17:39.146
Mary Alice, the hotel, I know where it's at.

17:39.148 --> 17:40.281
I saw Main Street.

17:40.283 --> 17:41.582
So how far do you think the shooting was...

17:41.584 --> 17:43.217
It was about a half block away.

17:43.219 --> 17:44.218
- That's it?
- Yeah.

17:44.220 --> 17:46.420
Now, did Joe Dye go to jail for this?

17:46.422 --> 17:47.922
He did.

17:47.924 --> 17:50.658
In fact, I understand he turned himself in.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.260
But he was acquitted on self-defense.

17:53.262 --> 17:54.328
Wow.

17:55.463 --> 17:57.598
So, what kind of guy was Joe Dye?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.932
He was a known outlaw

17:58.934 --> 18:01.302
from Arizona and Southern California.

18:01.304 --> 18:03.604
He was known to be very mean

18:03.606 --> 18:06.306
and very violent and a high temper.

18:06.308 --> 18:08.075
Nobody messed around with Joe Dye.

18:08.077 --> 18:10.244
This guy's got that crazed look on his face.

18:10.246 --> 18:12.613
Everybody was scared to death of him.

18:12.615 --> 18:16.817
He even had notches on his
gun as the number of victims.

18:16.819 --> 18:19.086
- He had several victims?
- Yes.

18:19.088 --> 18:21.755
16 years before he was in Los Angeles

18:21.757 --> 18:23.390
that he killed his boss.

18:23.392 --> 18:24.992
Geez.

18:24.994 --> 18:28.362
He also shot a dog of
some adversary or client

18:28.364 --> 18:31.332
that he didn't like just to
prove that he meant business.

18:35.737 --> 18:38.739
The guy in the black is not good.

18:38.741 --> 18:42.977
I think he's from way back,
like 18... something.

18:42.979 --> 18:46.746
Definitely a transient...
traveled all the time.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.149
I'm not sure why the man in black is here,

18:49.151 --> 18:50.885
but I can see that he's a coward

18:50.887 --> 18:52.853
who shows himself as a shadow man

18:52.855 --> 18:55.922
so he can terrorize living
people inside this hotel.

18:55.924 --> 18:58.992
I think he killed prostitutes, mainly.

18:58.994 --> 19:01.595
He definitely strangled his victims.

19:01.597 --> 19:03.397
Occasionally, he'd have to shoot them.

19:06.734 --> 19:09.569
So, when exactly was the hotel built?

19:09.571 --> 19:12.206
The hotel was built in 1911.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.109
- Mary Alice, you mentioned there
was another incident? - Yes.

19:15.111 --> 19:17.812
Quite a few years later in 1969,

19:17.814 --> 19:22.983
this woman, Ferry Banister,
was the manager at the time.

19:22.985 --> 19:24.218
Okay.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.188
And she was awakened in
the middle of the night

19:27.190 --> 19:30.024
by somebody yelling and pounding on a door.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.259
And so she, of course, went upstairs

19:32.261 --> 19:34.261
to see what was going on.

19:34.263 --> 19:38.365
And she came across this
young man just having a fit,

19:38.367 --> 19:40.901
yelling he couldn't find his key.

19:40.903 --> 19:44.338
So, she went down and
picked up the extra key

19:44.340 --> 19:45.739
and brought it back.

19:45.741 --> 19:50.377
And he beat her up and stabbed her.

19:50.379 --> 19:51.912
And here is the article.

19:54.549 --> 19:56.082
- He fled.
- Okay.

19:56.084 --> 19:59.419
And witnesses saw him drive away in a car

19:59.421 --> 20:01.955
and he was later arrested.

20:01.957 --> 20:04.191
And what was the reason
for this guy stabbing her?

20:04.193 --> 20:05.826
I don't think they know.

20:05.828 --> 20:07.627
She's taken to the hospital.

20:07.629 --> 20:08.796
She survives.

20:08.798 --> 20:10.264
Is she alive today?

20:10.266 --> 20:11.766
She died in 2004,

20:11.768 --> 20:14.368
so she died an elderly woman in her 90s.

20:16.904 --> 20:18.239
Ow.

20:18.241 --> 20:20.507
Like, there's people fighting.

20:20.509 --> 20:22.176
Ow.

20:28.484 --> 20:32.619
Some... and there's some
kind of fighting happening.

20:35.623 --> 20:37.958
I feel like somebody gets stabbed.

20:40.463 --> 20:42.096
[Bleep] It hurts.

20:42.098 --> 20:43.997
I feel like it's a knife.

20:43.999 --> 20:46.000
I think it's a woman.

20:46.002 --> 20:48.935
I feel like it caught her off-guard.

20:48.937 --> 20:50.871
She's trying to get away.

20:50.873 --> 20:56.577
You know,
I just see hands and feeling all this pain.

20:56.579 --> 20:58.579
You all right?

20:58.581 --> 21:00.580
Ow.

21:14.322 --> 21:15.868
So far, I've got a family

21:15.968 --> 21:18.207
that's been torn apart by obsession

21:18.307 --> 21:21.341
and a property that's
been the site of violence.

21:21.343 --> 21:23.310
But I need to see if there's anything else.

21:25.146 --> 21:26.446
Digging through the archives,

21:26.448 --> 21:28.248
I find that Santa Paula was devastated

21:28.250 --> 21:31.451
by one of the worst disasters
in California's history.

21:31.453 --> 21:35.455
But the headlines don't say how
it affected my client's hotel.

21:38.626 --> 21:40.461
I'm heading over to meet with a local author

21:40.463 --> 21:41.695
who says she's got information

21:41.697 --> 21:43.196
that will definitely help my case.

21:50.338 --> 21:51.788
Well, Peggy, thanks for meeting me.

21:51.888 --> 21:53.320
I appreciate that.

21:53.971 --> 21:57.439
I came across this article about
the St. Francis Dam disaster.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.308
What can you tell me about it?

21:59.310 --> 22:01.310
On the night of March 12, 1928,

22:01.312 --> 22:03.946
it was just a few minutes before midnight,

22:03.948 --> 22:05.514
the St. Francis Dam burst

22:05.516 --> 22:08.717
and it released 12.4
billion gallons of water.

22:08.719 --> 22:11.253
The flood wave was 140 feet high.

22:11.255 --> 22:15.223
This is what the dam looked
like before it burst.

22:15.225 --> 22:18.761
And this is what the dam
looked like after it burst.

22:18.763 --> 22:20.930
Wow.

22:20.932 --> 22:24.099
Five hours and 27 minutes
after the dam had broken,

22:24.101 --> 22:28.471
the flood wave finally swept
out to sea 54 miles later.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.972
It came right through here.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.441
It came right through the
Santa Clara River Valley.

22:32.443 --> 22:35.143
Look at it now,
and this is what it looked like afterwards.

22:38.848 --> 22:41.350
By the time the flood
waters reached Santa Paula,

22:41.352 --> 22:46.589
it was water and equipment
and trees and mud and bodies.

22:46.591 --> 22:48.157
- Oh, geez.
- It was dreadful.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.593
What kind of a body count we talking about?

22:51.595 --> 22:54.362
The official body count was about 500.

22:54.364 --> 22:55.498
Geez.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.766
But a lot of people think that it would

22:57.768 --> 23:00.335
have to be higher than that... 600, 700,
more.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.104
Do we have any idea what the death toll was

23:02.106 --> 23:03.305
for Santa Paula itself?

23:03.307 --> 23:04.940
Well, approximately at least 200.

23:04.942 --> 23:06.341
Where I'm investigating, Glen Tavern Inn,

23:06.343 --> 23:07.977
was that affected by this?

23:07.979 --> 23:09.644
The first floor received damage.

23:09.646 --> 23:11.647
- It was on high enough ground.
- Okay.

23:11.649 --> 23:15.017
So, the Glen Tavern Inn became a refuge

23:15.019 --> 23:17.786
for families that lost their homes,

23:17.788 --> 23:20.689
that were trying to locate the
bodies of their loved ones.

23:20.691 --> 23:24.093
Now, do they know what
caused the thing to burst?

23:24.095 --> 23:26.729
They used shoddy building materials.

23:26.731 --> 23:29.264
It was probably greed on
the part of Los Angeles.

23:29.266 --> 23:30.532
Okay.

23:35.939 --> 23:39.541
The floor is wrong here.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.145
There's like this sinking,
like it's going down,

23:43.147 --> 23:45.280
like a hole or something is here.

23:48.018 --> 23:50.185
There's a lot of commotion here.

23:50.187 --> 23:52.321
There's a lot of commotion here.

23:52.323 --> 23:55.691
The floor was wet.

23:55.693 --> 23:57.592
Something about the carpet was wet.

23:57.594 --> 23:58.627
The carpet was wet.

24:02.198 --> 24:04.500
There's a lot of arguing over this.

24:04.502 --> 24:06.101
You know, the guys are like,

24:06.103 --> 24:07.803
"This is gonna mess everything up

24:07.805 --> 24:09.404
if we don't fix this right now."

24:09.406 --> 24:12.941
The other men are kind of like,
"Well, we don't really care."

24:12.943 --> 24:15.377
It's all about money.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.449
I've already got a lot of history

24:21.451 --> 24:22.885
on Tom and Rosanna's property,

24:22.887 --> 24:25.120
but it turns out there's one more thing.

24:25.122 --> 24:27.689
A local sheriff tells me
he found a recent death

24:27.691 --> 24:31.026
that didn't even make the papers
right on the hotel grounds.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.004
Well, Sheriff Dean, thanks for meeting me.

24:42.006 --> 24:43.205
I appreciate that.

24:43.207 --> 24:45.373
You said you actually found
a death in the location?

24:45.375 --> 24:48.043
Yeah,
we actually did some checking and found

24:48.045 --> 24:51.046
that there was a suicide
back in 2007 that occurred.

24:51.048 --> 24:53.315
This is a copy of the coroner's report

24:53.317 --> 24:54.917
from the suicide.

24:54.919 --> 24:57.485
He was found in the
apartments just to the rear

24:57.487 --> 24:59.788
of the guest rooms at the Glen Tavern.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.991
61-year-old male, Henry.

25:01.993 --> 25:03.258
So it said he hung himself.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.060
What are the circumstances? Do you know?

25:05.062 --> 25:06.461
He had been living at the hotel

25:06.463 --> 25:08.663
and his family hadn't heard
from him in a couple days,

25:08.665 --> 25:10.533
so they actually called
the keepers and said,

25:10.535 --> 25:12.801
"Hey, would you mind going
and taking a look and check?"

25:12.803 --> 25:14.737
They used the pass key
to go in and found him.

25:14.739 --> 25:16.939
He could have been there
for one or two days.

25:16.941 --> 25:18.373
Do you know what the circumstances were?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.442
Did he leave a note or anything?
Or was it just one of those...

25:20.444 --> 25:22.477
Really wasn't much out of the ordinary.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.846
They did notice several 20-ounce beer cans

25:24.848 --> 25:26.048
that were in the trash.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.916
It appears he tried to hang himself

25:27.918 --> 25:29.384
with a belt in the closet.

25:29.386 --> 25:32.220
It looks like he wasn't
successful the first time

25:32.222 --> 25:35.490
and found another belt and, unfortunately,

25:35.492 --> 25:37.693
was successful on the second attempt.

25:41.631 --> 25:44.699
I just hear the word "mad man".

25:49.539 --> 25:52.875
And I see, like, a guy in the corner,

25:52.877 --> 25:54.776
like, hunched down and balled up.

25:54.778 --> 25:55.978
And he's like...

25:59.650 --> 26:01.550
He'll get up on the desk or the bed,
you know,

26:01.552 --> 26:03.585
and he's like constantly writing, writing...

26:03.587 --> 26:05.154
scratching and writing on the walls.

26:05.156 --> 26:09.791
I think this guy was probably schizophrenic.

26:09.793 --> 26:12.127
I think he killed himself.

26:18.901 --> 26:21.069
I saw several dead people on my walk,

26:21.071 --> 26:22.270
but the man in black

26:22.272 --> 26:24.572
poses the greatest threat to the living.

26:24.574 --> 26:26.641
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

26:26.643 --> 26:29.144
to describe how he appeared in life.

26:29.146 --> 26:32.314
He was on the thin side,

26:32.316 --> 26:38.220
between 5'10 " and 6'1".

26:38.222 --> 26:42.057
I would say that his features were sharp.

26:42.059 --> 26:46.996
He had a longer nose than usual,
very dark eyes.

26:51.867 --> 26:54.536
Is this who you saw?

26:54.538 --> 26:56.404
Yes.

27:17.432 --> 27:20.100
Now that Amy and I
finished our investigations,

27:20.102 --> 27:22.903
it's time to reveal our
findings to our clients

27:22.905 --> 27:25.039
and each other for the first time.

27:25.041 --> 27:28.709
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Tom and Rosanna.

27:28.711 --> 27:31.545
They're a married couple

27:31.547 --> 27:33.680
that own this place and
they actually live here.

27:33.682 --> 27:36.049
Now, you know how most of our
clients can't afford to move out?

27:36.051 --> 27:37.485
They actually can.

27:37.487 --> 27:40.054
I want to show you where they came from.

27:40.056 --> 27:42.289
It's a Malibu beach house.

27:42.291 --> 27:45.592
Problem is, Rosanna's gotten
obsessed with this place.

27:45.594 --> 27:49.130
It's taken over and she refuses to leave.

27:49.132 --> 27:50.931
The activity's bad here

27:50.933 --> 27:52.866
and it's tearing their family apart.

27:52.868 --> 27:54.868
Matter of fact, here's a photo of everybody.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.738
They have two daughters... Aisha, Gabriella.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.740
There's Tom and Rosanna.

27:59.742 --> 28:01.742
Aisha actually lives here.

28:01.744 --> 28:04.145
But Gabriella got so fed up
with this place, she left,

28:04.147 --> 28:07.081
went as far away from here as she could.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.317
So, Rosanna wants to know
if it's safe to stay here

28:10.319 --> 28:11.385
while the rest of the family

28:11.387 --> 28:12.820
wants you to talk her into leaving.

28:14.155 --> 28:15.355
So, now that Amy knows

28:15.357 --> 28:17.291
a little bit about what's going on,

28:17.293 --> 28:19.593
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

28:22.030 --> 28:25.366
I was overwhelmed walking in.

28:25.368 --> 28:27.568
I got initially

28:27.570 --> 28:32.306
a lot of different types
of residual impressions.

28:32.308 --> 28:36.643
The first one was when I
was on the second floor

28:36.645 --> 28:40.448
and I kind of felt like
a fire had taken place.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.716
I was seeing all the people running,

28:42.718 --> 28:45.986
but I didn't feel like anybody died.

28:45.988 --> 28:48.789
We had a fire in 2005,

28:48.791 --> 28:52.059
and it was on the second and third floor.

28:52.061 --> 28:54.895
It was a serious fire,
but nobody was injured.

28:54.897 --> 28:56.063
Okay.

28:56.065 --> 28:57.531
I actually have a photo of the actual fire

28:57.533 --> 28:58.566
when it was happening.

28:59.668 --> 29:00.968
Wow!

29:02.737 --> 29:04.905
Now, this is the strange part.

29:04.907 --> 29:07.641
They were insured for $1.3 million exactly,
right?

29:07.643 --> 29:10.211
- Mm-hmm.
- It cost exactly $1.3 million to fix that.

29:12.079 --> 29:14.247
Now, this is after renovating the place.

29:14.249 --> 29:16.850
They were getting ready to
sell it and then this happened.

29:16.852 --> 29:18.785
Okay. Wow.

29:22.224 --> 29:23.624
The other thing that I got

29:23.626 --> 29:25.292
was when I walked into the lobby.

29:25.294 --> 29:29.596
I saw the floor sinking and,
like, the carpets were wet.

29:29.598 --> 29:34.735
There was water,
and there were several men talking.

29:34.737 --> 29:37.871
One man was saying that if all of this

29:37.873 --> 29:41.642
wasn't cleaned up and fixed,
it would cause a mess.

29:41.644 --> 29:45.546
Another man was saying
he didn't really care,

29:45.548 --> 29:47.715
that he didn't want to waste the money.

29:47.717 --> 29:51.685
It seemed to be a pretty
stressful situation.

29:51.687 --> 29:56.423
Back in 1928, March 12th, to be exact,

29:56.425 --> 29:58.392
St. Francis Dam gave way.

29:58.394 --> 30:01.061
The Glen Tavern itself,

30:01.063 --> 30:03.363
the only damage it received
was the first floor...

30:03.365 --> 30:05.298
water damage.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.433
Okay.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.435
The rest of the town got hit really bad.

30:08.437 --> 30:12.138
Now, the dam itself was
35 miles East of here.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.074
But when the dam failed,

30:14.076 --> 30:16.777
12.4 billion gallons of
water came rushing out.

30:16.779 --> 30:20.447
The water got as high as 140 feet,

30:20.449 --> 30:22.650
actually swept its way through this town.

30:22.652 --> 30:24.484
They estimate 500 died,

30:24.486 --> 30:27.253
at least 200 died that lived in Santa Paula.

30:27.255 --> 30:29.523
Now, the other thing is everybody

30:29.525 --> 30:32.559
that survived that flood
wound up in this hotel

30:32.561 --> 30:35.829
at some point, you know, to seek refuge.

30:35.831 --> 30:39.600
Makes sense now. Okay.

30:42.436 --> 30:44.271
What else did you see?

30:44.273 --> 30:48.441
When I was on the second floor,
there was a suicide

30:48.443 --> 30:54.114
I got of a male who seemed
to be schizophrenic.

30:54.116 --> 30:55.749
He was, like, crawling on the ceiling

30:55.751 --> 30:57.484
and he was, like, writing on the walls.

30:57.486 --> 31:01.188
And I got that he hung himself.

31:02.691 --> 31:05.793
Back in 2007, you guys actually
owned the place at the time,

31:05.795 --> 31:08.094
a guy by the name of Henry,

31:08.096 --> 31:11.164
he hung himself in the closet using a belt.

31:11.166 --> 31:14.535
He had, according to the
coroner's report I read,

31:14.537 --> 31:15.736
alcohol abuse.

31:15.738 --> 31:18.238
He'd been drinking heavily.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.474
Why he killed himself, we don't know.

31:20.476 --> 31:22.776
- We remember him very well.
- Yeah, we remember him.

31:22.778 --> 31:25.746
And he was a very nice guy.

31:25.748 --> 31:28.148
What floor did you say this happened?

31:28.150 --> 31:30.316
It's an outside area.

31:30.318 --> 31:31.418
There's like two rooms.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.654
That's correct. That's where it happened.

31:33.656 --> 31:35.522
It's the exact spot where he hung himself.

31:35.524 --> 31:37.758
That's right above our room.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.992
Oh, wow.

31:38.994 --> 31:41.261
I'm surprised that you
found out about Henry.

31:41.263 --> 31:42.696
It was not in the papers.

31:42.698 --> 31:45.098
I get information most people can't.

31:49.203 --> 31:51.204
Anything else?

31:51.206 --> 31:54.875
In several places throughout the hotel,

31:54.877 --> 32:01.248
I would suddenly feel this intense fear.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.551
It would feel like a rock

32:04.553 --> 32:07.154
just fell right into my stomach.

32:07.156 --> 32:09.289
And then I would get really anxious.

32:09.291 --> 32:12.358
I definitely thought that living people

32:12.360 --> 32:14.661
would feel this sensation.

32:14.663 --> 32:17.197
- She feels all those things.
- Mm-hmm.

32:17.199 --> 32:20.534
I get that terrible pit in my stomach

32:20.536 --> 32:22.670
and I don't know what it's coming from.

32:22.672 --> 32:25.138
It's like this horrible thing,
like an impending doom.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.974
Just...

32:26.976 --> 32:28.275
Rosanna, do me favor.

32:28.277 --> 32:30.477
Just explain to Amy about
the dynamics of the family,

32:30.479 --> 32:32.679
how obsessed you really are with this place.

32:32.681 --> 32:35.015
I feel at home. I love this place.

32:35.017 --> 32:39.019
But my family, they don't like
the fact that I love it so much.

32:39.021 --> 32:40.654
They're kind of jealous, I think.

32:40.656 --> 32:43.190
That scares me.
It sounds like you want to stay here forever.

32:43.192 --> 32:45.692
And that sounds strange.

32:45.694 --> 32:47.528
It sounds obsessive.

32:47.530 --> 32:50.397
Our kids had complained ever
since we bought the place

32:50.399 --> 32:53.466
that it was causing us to
behave in unnatural ways,

32:53.468 --> 32:56.102
that something seemed to happen to us here.

32:57.939 --> 32:59.840
This is supposed to be temporary.

32:59.842 --> 33:02.375
I like it here.

33:02.377 --> 33:04.311
What can I say?

33:04.313 --> 33:05.979
I love it. It feels like home.

33:05.981 --> 33:07.214
I know. Sorry.

33:07.216 --> 33:09.750
Tell them sorry.

33:12.419 --> 33:14.054
Is there a reason she
may have a draw to this place?

33:14.056 --> 33:15.522
Is she like a sensitive, maybe?

33:15.524 --> 33:17.824
Actually, I think she might be

33:17.826 --> 33:19.660
drawn here for a different reason.

33:19.662 --> 33:23.463
Some people,
they'll just be attracted to locations

33:23.465 --> 33:27.100
where they were in previous lives.

33:27.102 --> 33:32.873
They feel this strong pull and
it feels like they're home.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.875
- And they don't know why.
- And they don't know why.

33:34.877 --> 33:37.177
But I've always felt that way.

33:37.179 --> 33:40.080
Why would you come back? Seriously?

33:40.082 --> 33:41.448
Because I like it.

33:43.317 --> 33:45.218
And that's kind of an example

33:45.220 --> 33:48.354
of how those situations can
become kind of unhealthy.

33:48.356 --> 33:51.158
And it's become our life.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.193
It's become kind of all-consuming

33:53.195 --> 33:55.863
for our whole family.

34:01.269 --> 34:05.238
The feelings that you've
had of anger and anxiety

34:05.240 --> 34:09.176
are mostly caused by one entity.

34:09.178 --> 34:12.212
And I met him on the third floor.

34:12.214 --> 34:13.547
Hmm.

34:13.549 --> 34:17.717
One of the rooms up there
is very much his area.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.620
The room was 308.

34:23.791 --> 34:28.328
He'll do whatever it
takes to keep people out.

34:28.330 --> 34:31.965
He very much dislikes women.

34:31.967 --> 34:35.467
You know, like I'm seeing
this woman laying in a bed

34:35.469 --> 34:38.204
and he's pinning her down and he's, like,

34:38.206 --> 34:42.308
punching her across the face.

34:42.310 --> 34:45.678
He's not a good person at all.

34:45.679 --> 34:48.514
Now, 308's your most active...

34:48.516 --> 34:49.983
It's one of the most active, yes.

34:49.985 --> 34:51.985
That's where you get most
of your customer complaints.

34:51.987 --> 34:55.522
About two weeks ago, a man came downstairs,

34:55.524 --> 34:57.690
just threw the key on
the front desk and said,

34:57.692 --> 34:59.726
"You guys didn't tell me this was haunted."

34:59.728 --> 35:02.195
He stormed out of here. He was so mad.

35:03.330 --> 35:07.267
She got locked in a
bathroom down here one time.

35:07.269 --> 35:09.069
Explain that to Amy what happened.

35:09.071 --> 35:13.106
I was in a bathroom inside of
a room that has no windows.

35:13.108 --> 35:16.076
As I close the door,
I saw the doorknob move.

35:16.078 --> 35:19.546
And then the doorknob fell to the floor.

35:19.548 --> 35:20.981
Oh, wow.

35:20.983 --> 35:23.349
And I started hitting the door
and screaming louder and louder.

35:23.351 --> 35:25.853
And before you knew it,
I was in complete hysteria.

35:25.855 --> 35:28.755
And then finally,
housekeeper happened to go in that area

35:28.757 --> 35:29.990
and heard me screaming.

35:29.992 --> 35:33.060
It was the scariest time of my life.

35:34.529 --> 35:36.362
Now, is this something that this guy can do?

35:37.899 --> 35:41.902
It's something that he
could and would probably do.

35:49.477 --> 35:52.045
What I was able to get out of him

35:52.047 --> 35:54.281
was that he was a transient.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.717
This was back in the late 1800s.

35:56.719 --> 36:01.989
And he is just a very,
very, very nasty person.

36:01.991 --> 36:05.558
I do believe that this
male was a serial killer.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.862
He killed women, mostly,
and they were prostitutes.

36:11.398 --> 36:14.300
His preferred method was to strangle them,

36:14.302 --> 36:16.436
but occasionally he did
have to shoot people.

36:16.438 --> 36:20.206
Now, I don't know about
anybody killing prostitutes,

36:20.208 --> 36:22.876
but there's one guy that I
came across during research

36:22.878 --> 36:26.013
that might have fit the bill,
especially the time frame...

36:26.015 --> 36:27.647
the traveling, killing people.

36:27.649 --> 36:28.882
It's a guy, Joe Dye.

36:28.884 --> 36:31.217
Not a good guy.

36:31.219 --> 36:33.886
He killed a boss of his in Los Angeles.

36:33.888 --> 36:35.922
He actually killed another rival's dog

36:35.924 --> 36:37.758
to let him know he meant business.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.592
- He shot and killed a dog.
- Oh.

36:39.594 --> 36:42.129
Apparently, he had notches on his gun
for the amount of people he killed.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.199
- Well, you mentioned he hated women, too.
- Mm-hmm.

36:46.201 --> 36:49.836
Back in 1886, he was married
to a very beautiful girl

36:49.838 --> 36:51.338
here in Santa Paula on a ranch

36:51.340 --> 36:53.373
and he used to go away a lot for work.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.143
When he came back on one trip,

36:56.145 --> 36:58.211
he had heard that this one guy,
Herman Haines,

36:58.213 --> 36:59.813
might be taking up with his wife.

36:59.815 --> 37:02.348
Joe Dye, about a half a block from here,

37:02.350 --> 37:03.649
put a bullet in his back

37:03.651 --> 37:06.219
and the guy lived for
three days and then died.

37:06.221 --> 37:08.789
I got a photo of him.

37:08.791 --> 37:12.125
- He's a crazy-looking guy.
- Ew!

37:13.929 --> 37:15.996
- Those eyes.
- Wow.

37:18.332 --> 37:21.201
Now, do you think this is
the guy you might have seen?

37:21.203 --> 37:22.970
I don't know.
You can look at the sketch and tell me.

37:27.975 --> 37:29.509
Take a look. I mean...

37:31.846 --> 37:32.846
Hmm.

37:36.184 --> 37:38.351
They don't look like the same person.

37:40.354 --> 37:43.123
I don't know about that.

37:43.125 --> 37:45.392
If you put a beard on him...

37:45.394 --> 37:47.327
Oh, yeah. Maybe.

37:50.764 --> 37:52.399
Well, whoever this guy was,

37:52.401 --> 37:54.567
what does he want with these guys?

37:54.569 --> 37:59.873
What he wants is to continue
being the way he was in life.

37:59.875 --> 38:02.675
So, he wants to kill women, really.

38:05.479 --> 38:07.748
What do you think about all this?

38:07.750 --> 38:10.817
I do know that there is something here,

38:10.819 --> 38:13.053
but I also feel that there's
a lot of protection...

38:13.055 --> 38:14.554
a lot of good.

38:14.556 --> 38:16.556
And if there is bad entities,

38:16.558 --> 38:18.891
I'm sure that the good
ones will knock them out.

38:18.893 --> 38:21.661
You think as long as you
respect the building,

38:21.663 --> 38:24.231
it's gonna treat you well and protect you?

38:24.233 --> 38:27.834
Oh, no, no.

38:27.836 --> 38:29.502
Mnh-mnh.

38:46.037 --> 38:49.507
You think as long as you
respect the building,

38:49.509 --> 38:51.576
that it's gonna treat
you well and protect you?

38:51.578 --> 38:55.179
Oh, no, no.

38:55.181 --> 38:56.981
Mnh-mnh.

39:06.091 --> 39:07.513
I do have more compassion

39:07.613 --> 39:09.480
for what my daughters are saying.

39:09.482 --> 39:13.650
I think Gabriella would be very
happy to hear you say that.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.653
I think you're right.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.158
I know that you're right.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.609
Well, you know what?

39:22.709 --> 39:24.409
We know what's going on in the hotel.

39:24.411 --> 39:25.676
But the big question remains,

39:25.678 --> 39:27.612
is it healthy or safe for you to stay here?

39:27.614 --> 39:29.247
Or do you need to leave?

39:29.249 --> 39:30.415
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:33.485 --> 39:35.954
I do think that you had a past life here.

39:35.956 --> 39:38.724
You have a connection here

39:38.726 --> 39:42.493
and, unfortunately, in this situation,

39:42.495 --> 39:45.230
you have deceased individuals here

39:45.232 --> 39:47.733
who have a connection with you, as well.

39:47.735 --> 39:50.301
And they're going to try to keep you here

39:50.303 --> 39:52.770
and manipulate you and blind you

39:52.772 --> 39:55.773
and bring that other person that they knew

39:55.775 --> 39:58.276
more and more to life in the present day.

39:58.278 --> 40:02.748
But that was then and
that was another lifetime.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.583
And this is now and this is your life now.

40:05.585 --> 40:10.188
And you need to move forward, not backwards.

40:10.190 --> 40:15.360
So, what I would like you to
do is bring in five mediums.

40:15.362 --> 40:20.966
And there are three types of mediums.

40:20.968 --> 40:23.835
And I would like one of
each of them to be present.

40:23.837 --> 40:25.836
So, there's a mental medium,

40:25.838 --> 40:28.473
a physical medium, and a psychic medium.

40:28.475 --> 40:31.609
The other two can be of any discipline.

40:31.611 --> 40:35.112
So, they would do two things...
clear the residual energy

40:35.114 --> 40:37.715
from this place and also move on

40:37.717 --> 40:40.985
as many of the deceased people as they can.

40:40.987 --> 40:45.790
Following that, you should really consider

40:45.792 --> 40:48.426
selling this place and walking away.

40:48.428 --> 40:51.429
The dead are going to be whispering,

40:51.431 --> 40:53.364
"Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave,"

40:53.366 --> 40:55.967
and try to change your mind.

40:55.969 --> 40:57.769
Will they let me go?

40:57.771 --> 41:00.172
It's about you letting them go
and letting this building go.

41:00.174 --> 41:04.009
Keep that in your head as a mantra,
you know,

41:04.011 --> 41:06.278
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.079
"You're not gonna ruin my marriage,

41:08.081 --> 41:10.382
"not gonna ruin my
relationships with my family.

41:10.384 --> 41:11.983
This is my fricking life now."

41:11.985 --> 41:13.751
I can see the possibilities

41:13.753 --> 41:16.154
and I could see where I possibly can go.

41:16.156 --> 41:18.990
But I'm torn because it's
like there's two people

41:18.992 --> 41:21.326
and I feel that other
force coming within me,

41:21.328 --> 41:22.994
like, saying, "No," you know?

41:22.996 --> 41:25.063
That my identity is here.

41:25.065 --> 41:28.066
I do believe that I can do it,
but it's gonna take a process.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.735
There's too much wiggle
room in that approach.

41:30.737 --> 41:32.570
You just have to make a decision.

41:32.572 --> 41:35.039
Let's say she moves everybody out

41:35.041 --> 41:36.641
and she doesn't leave here.

41:36.643 --> 41:39.977
Is her past life gonna consume her?

41:39.979 --> 41:40.978
Yes.

41:40.980 --> 41:42.747
I can see that happening, yeah.

41:42.749 --> 41:46.251
I'm making myself and my family stuck,
you know?

41:46.253 --> 41:48.886
Because it is so beautiful and it...

41:48.888 --> 41:50.355
Let someone else take care of it.

41:50.357 --> 41:53.057
You've done your time.

41:53.059 --> 41:55.560
I really hope Rosanna follows my advice

41:55.562 --> 41:58.129
and leaves her past life
in the hotel behind.

41:58.131 --> 42:01.166
I believe if she does that
and embraces the present,

42:01.168 --> 42:02.901
she and her family will be free

42:02.903 --> 42:04.969
of the obsession tearing them apart.
