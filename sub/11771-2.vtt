00:18.200 --> 00:19.800
THANK GOD
YOU STOPPED.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.467
OKAY, UM, I'M NOT
EVEN GONNA GET INTO

00:22.500 --> 00:24.533
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE ACTUAL CHOREOGRAPHY.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.467
I'M GONNA START WITH
YOUR SHOES, OKAY ?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.667
I TOLD YOU TO GET
CAPEZIO JAZZ OXFORDS.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.133
I WILL GET
THOSE SHOES TODAY.

00:30.167 --> 00:31.933
YOU'RE GONNA GET THE SHOES, BUT
YOU'RE ALSO GONNA GET THE STEPS,

00:31.967 --> 00:33.467
SO WE'RE GONNA BREAK
IT DOWN ONE MORE TIME,

00:33.500 --> 00:36.067
AND JUST WATCH
ONLY MY FEET.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.600
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE I WAS SEVEN.

00:37.633 --> 00:40.433
MY SOUNDS ARE
A LITTLE OFF.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.300
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
PRACTICE THAT MUCH.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.400
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

00:43.433 --> 00:45.933
I CAN DO THAT, BUT NOT
THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT.

00:45.967 --> 00:46.700
I CAN GO...

00:48.667 --> 00:50.233
WHY CAN'T I
JUST DO THAT ?

00:50.267 --> 00:51.833
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
THE CHOREOGRAPHY !

00:51.867 --> 00:54.600
THERE YOU GO.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.333
OKAY, I'M GONNA
THINK ABOUT THIS.

00:56.367 --> 00:57.533
YOU MOVE YOUR FEET

00:57.567 --> 00:59.233
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S THE HELL
IS GOING ON DOWN THERE.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.667

A PARTY ON SATURDAY

02:31.567 --> 02:32.533
IF IT WAS
TWO WEEKS AGO ?

02:32.567 --> 02:34.067
'CAUSE CHRISTINE
WAS OUT OF TOWN.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.600
WE COULDN'T GET IT TOGETHER
AND IT WORKED OUT THIS SATURDAY.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.100
UH, SO WHY EVEN

02:38.133 --> 02:39.700

02:50.567 --> 02:52.700
IT'S SOME OTHER DAY,
YOU KNOW, WHAT AM I DOING ?

02:52.733 --> 02:53.567

WE'RE BACK, EVERYONE.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.767
LET'S START AT
THE TOP OF THE SCENE.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.200
IT'S A TOTAL SCAM.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.067
HE INTRODUCED HER
AS A MODEL.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.900
SHE'S LIKE, COMPLETELY
BULLSHITTING THIS GUY.

03:06.933 --> 03:07.967
'CAUSE HE'S BLIND.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.067
BY THE WAY...

03:09.067 --> 03:10.933
THANK YOU FOR
COMING TO MEET KIM.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.167
I MIGHT'VE MENTIONED KENNY, HE'S
OLD MY FRIEND IN NEW YORK--

03:13.200 --> 03:14.233
YEAH, YEAH,
I KNOW.

03:14.267 --> 03:15.500
SHE JUST MOVED OUT
HERE FROM THE CITY.

03:15.533 --> 03:16.933
AND, UH, IT'S HIS
FIRST DAUGHTER,

03:16.967 --> 03:19.333
AND SHE CALLS ME,
LIKE, UNCLE RICHARD.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.233
I KNOWN HER
SINCE SHE WAS BORN.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.200
REALLY ?

03:21.233 --> 03:22.467
OH, THAT'S FUN,
UNCLE RICHARD.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.233
YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

03:24.267 --> 03:25.267
SHE'S A SINGER,
SHE'S TALENTED,

03:25.300 --> 03:27.133
BUT SHE WANTS TO GET
HER BREASTS ENLARGED,

03:27.167 --> 03:29.333
AND IT'S GONNA DRIVE
KENNY CRAZY, AND...

03:29.367 --> 03:30.167
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT ?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.100
NO.

03:31.133 --> 03:32.400
HE'S MY OLD FRIEND
AND, UH...

03:32.433 --> 03:35.067
I NEED YOU TO HELP
TO TALK HER OUT OF IT.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.700
JUST, LIKE, A BREAST
INTERVENTION.

03:36.733 --> 03:38.367
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO BRING THIS UP ?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.433
UH, THAT'S OKAY.

03:39.467 --> 03:40.700
I'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING,
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.800
YOU ALWAYS THINK OF
SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.967
IS EVERYTHING ELSE
GOOD IN YOUR LIFE ?

03:45.067 --> 03:46.167
BE HONEST WITH ME.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.333
HMM ?

03:47.367 --> 03:49.067
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY,

03:49.067 --> 03:52.067

THAT'S REALLY BUGGING YOU.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.700
I HAVE NOTHING
TO CONFIDE.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.800
YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED A HELL OF
A LOT THAT YOU HAVE NOT SHARED.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.200
WELL, YOU'VE MENTIONED THIS
TO ME A COUPLE OF TIMES.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.467
THAT I DON'T
CONFIDE IN YOU,

03:58.500 --> 03:59.600
AND I'M TELLING YOU
THERE'S NOTHING TO CONFIDE.

03:59.633 --> 04:03.067
YOU HAVEN'T CONFIDED IN ME
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

04:03.067 --> 04:04.300
HOW COULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

04:04.333 --> 04:05.600

THAT COUNTS.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.100

04:29.767 --> 04:31.567

04:31.600 --> 04:34.467

05:04.233 --> 05:06.567
HE SAID NO GIFTS.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.067

05:27.500 --> 05:28.867
HE SAID NO GIFTS,
SO I DIDN'T BRING ANYTHING.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.200

PRETTY GOOD.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.167
YEAH,

05:51.200 --> 05:52.600
WHAT SHOULD I DO
WITH THIS THING ?

05:52.633 --> 05:54.333
I THINK A WOMAN
WILL COME AROUND.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.267
JUST, YOU CAN
PUT IT ON A TABLE.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.533
EVERY TIME
I GET ONE OF THESE,

05:57.567 --> 05:59.500
I WIND UP HOLDING IT
THE WHOLE NIGHT, YOU KNOW ?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.767
IT'S A LOT OF DANCING
YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.067
OH, MAN,
OH, IT IS.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.367
I MEAN, I CAN SEE
WHEN LARRY COMES HOME...

06:05.400 --> 06:07.300
IS HE EXHAUSTED
WHEN HE COMES HOME ?

06:07.333 --> 06:08.967
I'M NOT TIRED.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.133
YOU GOTTA
WORK ON IT.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.133
YOU GOTTA WORK ON IT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE,

06:11.167 --> 06:12.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:12.367 --> 06:13.900
YOU GOTTA DO OFF-HOURS WORK,
AND KIND OF JUST

06:13.933 --> 06:16.067
SO YOU'RE PREPARED WHEN
YOU COME INTO REHEARSALS.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.833
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT
WORKING AS HARD,

06:17.867 --> 06:19.400
BUT IT LOOKS MORE
EFFORTLESS MAYBE.

06:19.433 --> 06:20.533
IT DOES LOOK
LIKE LESS EFFORT.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.567
MM-HMM.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.633
I MEAN, IT LOOKS,
LESS EFFORT, EFFORTLESS.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.200
LIKE AN IDIOT,
HOLDING THE SKEWER.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.633
WHAT THE HELL DO
I DO WITH THIS THING ?

06:29.667 --> 06:30.567
WE'RE GONNA MINGLE.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.167
NO, YOU SHOULD MINGLE.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.267
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.100
IT'S YOUR PARTY, YOU CAN
MINGLE IF YOU WANT TO.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.533
FIND ME
A SKEWER GUY.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.300
THIS IS, WILL YOU
SEND HIM OVER ?

06:38.333 --> 06:39.600
THROW IT DOWN,
IT'S FINE.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.067
YEAH, RELAX,
LARRY, RELAX.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.733
BYE, GUYS.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.933
DID YOU TELL LAR
ABOUT MY NEW THING ?

06:45.967 --> 06:47.433
NO, I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.

06:47.467 --> 06:49.067
WHY DON'T YOU TELL LARRY
ABOUT YOUR NEW THING ?

06:49.067 --> 06:50.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

06:50.433 --> 06:52.600

06:56.333 --> 06:58.467
INTERESTING, WHIMSICAL,
I'M TELLING YOU...

06:58.500 --> 06:59.633

07:01.500 --> 07:03.133

I WANNA SAY HELLO TO MICHAEL.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.500
THE PIANO PLAYER,

07:07.533 --> 07:09.733

07:09.767 --> 07:13.367

HELLO.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.133

07:32.200 --> 07:33.733
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

07:33.767 --> 07:34.933

HEY, LISTEN, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.633

07:42.667 --> 07:44.933
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL ?

07:44.967 --> 07:47.500

07:47.533 --> 07:49.267
EH ?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.067

07:51.067 --> 07:52.967
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, LARRY ?

07:53.067 --> 07:54.867
I DON'T SAY BEAUTIFUL.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.267
SHE'S NICE.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.067
HUH.

07:59.067 --> 08:00.600
SHE TOLD YOU
SHE WAS A MODEL ?

08:00.633 --> 08:02.900
I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.533
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE ?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.800
YOU CAN'T
SEE HER ANYWAY.

08:05.833 --> 08:06.900
WHAT ?

08:06.933 --> 08:09.167
THAT'S ONE OF
THE ADVANTAGES, RIGHT ?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.733
THAT AND
THE GOOD HEARING.

08:10.767 --> 08:12.633
GOOD HEARING ?

08:12.667 --> 08:14.233
WHAT IS THAT,
A MYTH ?

08:14.267 --> 08:16.067
I THOUGH BLIND PEOPLE
HAD BETTER HEARING.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.333
I DON'T KNOW, LARRY,
I'VE NEVER HAD IT TESTED.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.633
LIKE A DOG, I THOUGHT
YOU HEAR LIKE A DOG.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.067
HEY, LARRY.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.233
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

08:24.933 --> 08:27.633
SO THE THING THAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT THESE SHIRTS

08:27.667 --> 08:29.867
IS THAT I'VE GOT
THE BUSINESS FROM THE HOUSE.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.433
AND I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE BABY.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.167

WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, WHEN
I SHOWED THEM TO BEN STILLER,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.200

I HAVE TO SAY.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.167
IT WAS A
COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.067
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

10:42.100 --> 10:43.767
TWO WEEKS AFTER

10:43.800 --> 10:46.667
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS THERE ?

10:46.700 --> 10:47.900
WELL, WHY DON'T
I HAVE MY BIRTHDAY ?

10:47.933 --> 10:48.833

10:48.867 --> 10:49.867
I THINK I'LL HAVE
A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.933
OKAY.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.833
OKAY, THREE DAYS,
NO MORE THAN THAT THOUGH.

10:53.867 --> 10:55.467

BIRTHDAY ANYMORE.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.133
THERE'S GOTTA BE A TIME,
THERE'S GOTTA BE A CUT-OFF POINT

10:58.167 --> 11:00.300
WHERE YOU CAN'T
HAVE BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.267
ARE YOU SO DESPERATE
FOR A PARTY ?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.600

A PARTY TWO WEEKS AFTER ?

11:04.633 --> 11:06.600

OF THESE THINGS.

11:17.267 --> 11:18.767
YOU KNOW ?

11:18.800 --> 11:20.300
I DON'T LIKE A KABOB.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.067
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR
FEELINGS ARE ABOUT A KABOB,

11:22.100 --> 11:24.367

12:07.700 --> 12:09.267
YOU CAN

12:45.833 --> 12:48.433
THIS IS FUNNY

13:00.867 --> 13:01.867

13:01.900 --> 13:04.067

14:31.067 --> 14:33.533
GOD, HONEY.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.100

YEAH, YEAH.

14:49.933 --> 14:51.467
OKAY, AND HERE'S

14:51.500 --> 14:53.400
THAT'S THE REHEARSAL
TEMPO, ALRIGHT ?

14:53.433 --> 14:54.900
THAT'S THE WAY I TAUGHT IT
TO YOU TO BREAK IT DOWN.

14:54.933 --> 14:56.433
BUT IT'S MORE
LIKE THIS, ALRIGHT ?

14:56.467 --> 14:58.800

KEEP IT SMALL.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.433
KEEP IT SMALL.

15:09.467 --> 15:10.333
KEEP YOUR WEIGHT OVER
THE CENTER OF YOUR.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.367
COME ON,
THAT'S TOO FAST.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.800
I CAN'T DO IT
AT THAT TEMPO.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.300
THAT'S THE TEMPO
IT IS IN THE SHOW.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.600
UM, CAN WE
TAKE A FIVE ?

15:17.633 --> 15:18.900
FIVE MINUTES,
EVERYONE.

15:18.933 --> 15:19.733
FIVE MINUTES.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.067
USE YOUR TIME WISELY.

15:22.100 --> 15:26.333
BULLSHIT,
THAT'S NOT THE TEMPO.

15:26.367 --> 15:27.200
GET OUT OF HERE.

15:27.233 --> 15:28.233
I THINK IT IS.

15:28.267 --> 15:29.067
WHAT ?

15:29.067 --> 15:30.300
PRETTY MUCH.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.767
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY HUMAN
COULD DANCE TO THAT TEMPO.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.433
YOU'D HAVE TO BE FLASH
TO DANCE LIKE THAT.

15:35.467 --> 15:36.533
WHO ?

15:36.567 --> 15:37.500
OH, FORGET IT.

15:37.533 --> 15:38.467
IT'S A COMIC BOOK
CHARACTER.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.467
WORE THE RED COSTUME.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.867
THE GUY
IN THE RED COSTUME.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.433
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT RED IS.

15:42.467 --> 15:43.533
HM.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.700
IT'S HARD TO TALK
TO A BLIND GUY.

15:44.733 --> 15:46.567
YOU HAVE
NO REFERENCES.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.167
I DON'T KNOW COMICS,
LARRY.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.133
WHAT'S WITH YOU ?

15:50.167 --> 15:52.800
OH, RHONDA AND I KEPT
FIGHTING ALL NIGHT.

15:52.833 --> 15:55.867
SHE KEEPS INSISTING THAT SHE'S
NOT MISREPRESENTING HERSELF.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.133
OH, REALLY.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.100
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO TELL
MY WIFE I LOOK LIKE BRAD PITT.

15:59.133 --> 16:01.133
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
SHE CAN SEE.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.067
YOU DIG ?

16:02.067 --> 16:03.200
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING ?

16:03.233 --> 16:04.133
MM-HMM.

16:04.167 --> 16:06.200
HEY, BEN,
YOU'RE HERE.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.667
HEY, STEVE,
HOW YOU DOING ?

16:07.700 --> 16:08.233
HEY.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.067
HEY.

16:09.100 --> 16:13.200
OH, MY GOSH.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.133
I'M SO SORRY, MAN.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.733
SO SORRY.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.400
IT WAS THAT SKEWER,
THAT FUCKING SKEWER.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.133
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET,
REMEMBER I MENTIONED IT ?

16:20.167 --> 16:21.133
I COULDN'T
GET RID OF IT.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.433
YEAH, I GOTTA
SCRATCHED RETINA.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.300
OH, MY GOD.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.533
YEAH.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.967
I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU WERE
SO PREOCCUPIED WITH THAT,

16:27.067 --> 16:29.900
WHY YOU COULDN'T,
UH, SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.600
BEN, I NEVER SING
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:31.633 --> 16:32.800
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.167
I'M A LITTLE
SELF-CONSCIOUS SINGING IT.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.933
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU *

16:35.967 --> 16:38.133
STUPID, STUPID SONG.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.133
IT'S A STUPID SONG.

16:39.167 --> 16:41.567
RIGHT, AND ALSO,
THANKS FOR NO GIFT, TOO.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.100
I SEEM TO RECALL SOMEBODY
INVITING ME TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY

16:46.133 --> 16:49.167
AND SAYING,
"NO GIFTS".

16:49.200 --> 16:50.100
COME ON, LARRY.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.333
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

16:51.367 --> 16:52.367
YEAH.
BULLSHIT ?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.533
HOW'S THAT BULLSHIT ?

16:53.567 --> 16:55.067
IT'S BULLSHIT, YOU SAY,
NO GIFT, SO BRING A GIFT.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.733
WELL, WHY'D YOU
EVEN SAY IT ?

16:56.767 --> 16:58.833
JUST, I'M JUST SAYING
THIS AS A FRIEND.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.300
YOU REALLY HAVE
A LITTLE WAYS TO GO

17:01.333 --> 17:02.667
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING
WITH PEOPLE, REALLY.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.233
HOW SO ?

17:04.267 --> 17:06.367
YOU DON'T EVEN SHAKE MY HAND
THE FIRST TIME I SEE YOU,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.100
YOU KNOW, AT THE THEATER,
YOU KNOW ?

17:08.133 --> 17:09.600
YOU HAD SNOT@
YOU'D JUST SNEEZED.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.200
THAT WAS A
DRY SNEEZE, LARRY.

17:11.233 --> 17:12.333
IT WASN'T A SNEEZE,
IT WAS A--

17:12.367 --> 17:14.200
I CAN'T ASSUME DRY,
I GOTTA ASSUME WET.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.400
IT'S AIR COMING OUT.

17:15.433 --> 17:16.933
I'M NOT GONNA PUT OUT MY HAND
IF IT'S FULL OF SNOT.

17:16.967 --> 17:18.133
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS AIR.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.867
I THOUGHT I SAW SOME
LITTLE SPECKLES FLYING.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.667
I WOULD ASSUME YOU WOULD
KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW

17:21.700 --> 17:23.333
THAT I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE YOU A HANDFUL OF SNOT
TO SHAKE YOUR HAND.

17:23.367 --> 17:24.700
AND, BY THE WAY--

17:24.733 --> 17:26.067
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW
SNOT SPECKLES ARE COMING OUT.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.300
I SAW SNOT
SPECKLES FLYING.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.400
GUYS, WE NEED
TO START.

17:28.433 --> 17:29.267
YEAH, PLEASE.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.800
TOP OF THE PAGE,
PAGE 31.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.300
( piano music )

17:45.600 --> 17:48.100
( knocking )

17:52.800 --> 17:54.667
HI, LARRY.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.333
HEY, KIM.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.500
GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU ?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.233
SO, LISTEN, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL,

17:58.267 --> 17:59.267
BUT I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

17:59.300 --> 18:01.067
AND I JUST WANTED
TO BRING BY MY HEADSHOT

18:01.067 --> 18:03.067
AND MY REEL
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

18:03.067 --> 18:03.833
THERE YOU GO.

18:03.867 --> 18:04.367
COME ON IN.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.533
OH, THANKS.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.567
WOW, YOU HAVE A
REALLY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.967
YEAH, WE JUST
MOVED IN.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.067
DID YOU ?

18:11.067 --> 18:13.500
YEAH, SECOND TIME
WE'VE MOVED IN TWO YEARS.

18:13.533 --> 18:14.967
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE.

18:15.067 --> 18:18.200
YEAH, WE HAD TO MOVE, WE HAD A
FILM CREW ON OUR BLOCK, AND...

18:18.233 --> 18:19.700
OH, WHAT A DRAG.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.833
LISTEN, I'VE GOT A BOOK
I WANT TO GIVE TO RICHARD.

18:21.867 --> 18:22.933
SO WAIT HERE,
I'LL GO ...

18:22.967 --> 18:24.433
SURE, SURE, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:24.467 --> 18:25.533
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

18:25.567 --> 18:28.667
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT ME ?

18:30.200 --> 18:32.300
* DA, DA, DA,
DA, DA, DA *

18:32.333 --> 18:33.567
OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.667
THAT'S IT ?

18:34.700 --> 18:35.633
THAT'S IT.

18:35.667 --> 18:36.133
IT'S ALL DONE,
ALREADY ?

18:36.167 --> 18:37.300
IT'S ALL DONE.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.267
BOY, THAT WAS FAST.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.367
AN HOUR, IN AND OUT,
DONE, BOOBS.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.567
GENIUS.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.767
DON'T THEY
LOOK REAL ?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.133
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID THEY
WERE NOT GONNA LOOK REAL ?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.067
DO THEY NOT
LOOK REAL ?

18:46.067 --> 18:47.100
YOU WANT
TO SEE THEM ?

18:47.133 --> 18:48.967
CHECK THEM OUT,
CHECK THEM OUT, LOOK.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.233
THEY'RE GOOD,
RIGHT ?

18:50.267 --> 18:51.700
YEAH, FEEL THEM,
THEY FEEL TOTALLY NATURAL.

18:51.733 --> 18:52.633
I'M SURE.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.167
COME ON, LARRY,
DON'T BE SO UPTIGHT.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.900
COME HERE, FEEL THEM,
CHECK THEM OUT.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.500
THEY FEEL GOOD,
RIGHT ?

18:57.533 --> 18:59.433
SQUEEZE THEM,
GIVE THEM A LITTLE...

19:10.633 --> 19:12.867
SHE JUST, YOU KNOW,
SHE GRABBED MY HANDS,

19:12.900 --> 19:14.267
AND SHE JUST PUT
THEM OVER THERE.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.067
OH, REALLY,
WELL, GUESS WHAT ?

19:16.067 --> 19:17.267
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.133
BECAUSE THAT WAS YOUR 10th
ANNIVERSARY GIFT RIGHT THERE.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.333
OKAY, OH, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.367
YES, YES, YES.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.767
COME ON, CHERYL,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.667
THAT WASN'T SEX.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.067
YOU JUST HAD SEX !

19:25.067 --> 19:27.200
TOUCHING A BREAST
IS SEX.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.067
IT WASN'T
A REAL BREAST.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.433
OH, REALLY ?

19:31.467 --> 19:33.367
IT WAS LIKE PUTTING MY HAND
ON HER HEAD OR SOMETHING.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.500
IT WAS NOTHING.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.500
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT
YOUR HAND ON HER HEAD ?

19:36.533 --> 19:38.333
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T PUT
MY HAND ON HER HEAD.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.500
SHE PUT IT
OVER HERE.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.633
I LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T
CONTROL YOUR OWN HANDS.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.333
SHE TOOK MY HANDS,
AND WENT LIKE THAT.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.200
I SAW IT,
I SAW IT, LARRY.

19:45.233 --> 19:46.367
THAT'S IT.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.267
NO, DON'T.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.433
WHY AM I EVEN
TALKING TO YOU ?

19:49.467 --> 19:50.433
LOOK, OKAY, LET...

19:50.467 --> 19:52.600
OH, TITMOUSE.

19:52.633 --> 19:56.267
WHAT ?

19:56.300 --> 19:59.567
I JUST SAW
A TITMOUSE.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.133
A TITMOUSE ?

20:01.167 --> 20:01.867
A MOUSE.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.833
TITMOUSE,
MOUSE.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.233
WHY DO YOU CALL IT
A TITMOUSE ?

20:04.267 --> 20:06.033
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT,
A TITMOUSE, SAME THING.

20:06.067 --> 20:07.333
WHO CALLS IT THAT ?

20:07.367 --> 20:09.067
A LOT OF PEOPLE
CALL IT THAT.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.933
OH, MY GOD.

20:10.967 --> 20:11.700
WHAT ?

20:11.733 --> 20:14.600
YOU ARE OBSESSED
WITH TITS.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.633
YOU'RE FEELING UP
SOMEBODY'S TITS.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.600
YOU'RE TALKING
TO KIDS ABOUT TITS.

20:18.633 --> 20:19.567
TALKING TO KIDS ?

20:19.600 --> 20:20.900
THE KID SAID,
I LOVE TITS.

20:20.933 --> 20:21.867
THAT'S WHAT
THE KID SAID TO ME.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.133
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

20:23.167 --> 20:24.233
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO LITTLE BOYS ABOUT TITS ?

20:24.267 --> 20:27.400
HE WHISPERED IT TO ME,
IT WAS PART OF THE GAME.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.400
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
TELEPHONE BEFORE ?

20:29.433 --> 20:30.800
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO PLAY TELEPHONE, DO YOU ?

20:30.833 --> 20:32.033
I DO KNOW HOW
TO PLAY TELEPHONE.

20:32.067 --> 20:33.000
OH, DO YOU ?

20:33.033 --> 20:34.867
YEAH, BUT I PLAY
THE G-VERSION.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.967
IT'S USUALLY SOMETHING LIKE,
SUSIE LIVES DOWN THE LANE.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.900
( phone ringing )

20:43.233 --> 20:45.100
THE KID DIDN'T SAY,
SUSIE LIVES DOWN THE LANE.

20:45.133 --> 20:46.200
HE SAID,
I LOVE TITS.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.500
WHAT ?

20:48.533 --> 20:49.900
OH, MY GOD.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.467
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.133
ALRIGHT,
SIT TIGHT.

20:56.867 --> 20:58.567
WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO ?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.633
WHY DID YOU BREAK UP
WITH HER ?

20:59.667 --> 21:02.267
I NEED TO BE WITH
A GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.567
AND SINCE YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH
TO POINT THAT OUT TO ME,

21:05.600 --> 21:07.100
SHE HAD TO GO.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.200
YOU NEED TO BE WITH
A GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN ?

21:09.233 --> 21:10.700
WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE ?

21:10.733 --> 21:11.833
LOOK, THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.

21:11.867 --> 21:15.600
I NEED SOME ASSISTANCE,
SHE WAS INDISPENSABLE.

21:15.633 --> 21:17.833
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS ?

21:17.867 --> 21:18.867
YES, I HAVE FRIENDS.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.067
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
IMPOSE ON THEM.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.433
I THINK YOU
SHOULD HELP ME.

21:21.467 --> 21:24.733
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
GOT ME INTO THIS MESS.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.767
I NEED A LITTLE HELP.

21:28.533 --> 21:30.067
THANKS A LOT, LARRY.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.933
JUST, GRAB IT
THIS WAY.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.533
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET IN BETWEEN.

21:33.567 --> 21:34.800
WE'RE NOT
A GAY COUPLE.

21:34.833 --> 21:38.100
( music )

22:18.667 --> 22:20.767
HEY.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.267
HEY.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.167
WHAT'S DOING ?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.333
NOTHING.

22:24.367 --> 22:29.500
UM, I ACTUALLY WANNA BUY
ONE OF THOSE, UH, SHIRTS.

22:29.533 --> 22:30.467
YEAH ?

22:30.500 --> 22:32.300
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE STUD SWEATSHIRTS.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.467
YEAH, THOSE ARE GREAT.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.600
YEAH, I NEED
TO BUY ONE FOR BEN.

22:34.633 --> 22:35.667
OH.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.900
'CAUSE, UH, SUSIE
SAID HE LIKED IT, RIGHT ?

22:36.933 --> 22:37.967
HOW'S BEN DOING ?

22:38.067 --> 22:40.233
THE EYE IS OKAY.

22:40.267 --> 22:42.533
THE EYE IS NOT
THE PROBLEM.

22:42.567 --> 22:45.467
THE PROBLEM, WAS THAT
I DIDN'T SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.067
HE'S MAD AT YOU
FOR THAT ?

22:47.067 --> 22:48.300
I DON'T SING
THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.233
WELL, I NEVER SEE YOU SING
THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.400
IT'S A STUPID SONG,
I DON'T LIKE IT.

22:51.433 --> 22:52.933
WELL, YOU'RE ENTITLED.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.500
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT
THOSE STICKS, THOUGH.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.533
I LOOKED AROUND AT
THAT PARTY AT ONE POINT.

22:56.567 --> 22:59.067
I SAW FIVE PEOPLE
HOLDING STICKS.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.400
I DID.

23:00.433 --> 23:01.600
I WAS CHECKING.

23:01.633 --> 23:03.400
CAN'T JUST LAY IT DOWN,
LIKE, ON A TABLE ?

23:03.433 --> 23:04.900
IT'S GROSS.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.233
YOU CAN'T PUT THAT
DOWN ON A TABLE.

23:06.267 --> 23:08.167
YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR
A SERVER TO COME BY.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.367

23:24.500 --> 23:28.100
I WOULD LOVE TO BUY
ONE OF THOSE SHIRTS.

23:28.133 --> 23:29.233
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

23:29.267 --> 23:30.633
NO, SERIOUSLY.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.800
IT'S, LIKE, YOU GO TO A MOVIE
AND IT KIND OF STAYS WITH YOU.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.567
A GOOD MOVIE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.067

23:36.067 --> 23:38.333

THINKING ABOUT THE SHIRT ?

23:38.367 --> 23:39.900

WELL, I KNOW
THEY'RE GREAT SHIRTS.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.733
YOU KNOW THEY'RE
GREAT SHIRTS.

23:45.767 --> 23:46.733
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

23:46.767 --> 23:48.067
BECAUSE THE SHIRT
WAS TALKING TO ME,

23:48.067 --> 23:49.667
AND I NEED
A LITTLE MORE FLAIR.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.067
I DON'T HAVE
ANY FLAIR.

23:51.067 --> 23:53.500
THAT IS TRUE, ALRIGHT,
I HAVE THEM IN THE TRUNK.

24:06.733 --> 24:07.967

PALE AND PASTY FOR ?

24:08.067 --> 24:10.433
WELL, YOU ARE, YOU'RE NOT

24:10.467 --> 24:11.267
I PLAY GOLF.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.600
I'M OUT, I GET SUN.

24:12.633 --> 24:14.600
ALRIGHT, LARRY, I JUST THINK
THE RED IS A GOOD COLOR.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.767

24:27.367 --> 24:28.567
LET ME GO IN THE HOUSE,
AND I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.100
THAT'S ALRIGHT, I DON'T NEED
A BAG, I'LL JUST TAKE IT.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.067
