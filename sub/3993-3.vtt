MAN OUTSIDE SHOUTS COMMANDS

00:11.400 --> 00:15.000
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.759
We had been to a bar,

00:17.760 --> 00:22.479
nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses,

00:22.480 --> 00:26.959
and Karen weren't happy with that,
so...when we get back to the hotel,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.119
we end up having
a bit of a ding-dong.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.959
HE SIGHS

00:31.960 --> 00:36.479
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.919
Wasn't a real man.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.319
What?
It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

00:42.320 --> 00:44.000
Oh.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.039
Go on.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.319
Well...then I don't know
how it happened,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.720
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...

00:56.400 --> 01:00.279
..and me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.879
He learned us how to cut up a beast.
Taught.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.078
What?
Taught you how to cut up a beast.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.279
Yeah, well, then I done it.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.639
Did it.
Did it! Stabbed her,

01:09.640 --> 01:13.640
over and over and over, and I looked
down, and she weren't...

01:14.680 --> 01:16.720
..wasn't...

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
..moving no more.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.480
Any more.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.679
God help me, I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.320
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!

01:33.320 --> 01:35.319
Everyone says you're the best.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.719
Without you...

01:36.720 --> 01:39.239
I'll get hung for this.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.440
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.840
Hanged, yes.

GUNSHOTS

What the hell are you doing?!

02:50.160 --> 02:51.599
Bored.
What?!

02:51.600 --> 02:53.519
Bored!
No...

02:53.520 --> 02:55.239
GUNSHOT Bored!

02:55.240 --> 02:57.199
GUNSHOT Bored!

02:57.200 --> 03:01.479
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.799
Good job I'm not one of them.
So you take it out on the wall?

03:04.800 --> 03:06.600
The wall had it coming.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.919
What about that Russian case? Belarus?
Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.680
Oh, shame(!)

03:21.400 --> 03:24.240
Anything in? I'm starving.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.080
Oh, f...

03:34.160 --> 03:37.279
There's a head.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.679
A severed head!
Just tea for me, thanks.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.359
No, there's a head in the fridge.
Yes? A bloody head! Well, where else

03:43.360 --> 03:45.599
could I put it?
You don't mind, do you?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.159
Well...
Got it from Barts morgue.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.279
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.399
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.879
Er...yes.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.919
A Study In Pink.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.119
Nice.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.599
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.919
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

04:05.920 --> 04:09.759
Um...no. Why not?
I thought you'd be flattered.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.079
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.079
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is

04:16.079 --> 04:18.000
"about some things." Hang on,
I didn't mean that...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.918
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way(!)

04:20.920 --> 04:25.399
Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister or...
I know. ..who's sleeping with who...

04:25.400 --> 04:28.519
Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
That again! It's not important!

04:28.520 --> 04:30.079
Not impor...?!

04:30.080 --> 04:35.079
It's primary school stuff. How can you not know that?
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.999
Deleted it?

04:37.000 --> 04:41.039
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense

04:41.040 --> 04:44.239
to put things in there
that are useful. REALLY useful.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.759
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.759
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.279
But it's the solar system!

04:53.280 --> 04:57.919
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!
So we go round the sun. If we went round the moon,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.679
or round and round the garden like a teddy
bear, it wouldn't make any difference!

05:01.680 --> 05:07.399
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

05:07.400 --> 05:11.760
Put that in your blog! Or, better still,
stop inflicting your opinions on the world!

05:13.760 --> 05:16.920
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

05:19.000 --> 05:23.119
Where are you going?
Out! I need some air.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.880
Oh, sorry, love! Sorry.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.240
Ooh-ooh!
Have you two had a little domestic?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.439
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.000
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.160
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.959
Quiet.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.800
Calm. Peaceful.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.479
Isn't it hateful?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.599
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.519
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.399
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.120
Hey, what have you done
to my bloody wall?!

06:11.440 --> 06:15.080
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

Told you you should have gone with the Lilo.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.520
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.439
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you know.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.679

Well, make it yourself. I'm going to have a shower.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.119

or friends and relatives.' Sorry! I've got to run!

07:23.320 --> 07:26.280
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.320

PIZZICATO NOTE John.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.999
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.319
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.239
Gas leak, apparently.
PIZZICATO NOTE

07:58.240 --> 07:59.799
I can't.
Can't?

07:59.800 --> 08:03.359
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.719
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.279
PIZZICATO NOTE How's the diet?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.159
Fine.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.920
Perhaps you can get
through to him, John.

08:12.921 --> 08:15.959
What? I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.359
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

08:18.360 --> 08:24.079
No. I can't possibly be away from the office for any
length of time. Not with the Korean elections so...

08:24.080 --> 08:27.399
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

08:27.400 --> 08:32.318
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...legwork.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.958
FALSE NOTE

08:33.960 --> 08:35.760
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.879
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.039
Oh, yes, of course.
How...? Oh, never mind.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.359
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he became...

08:46.360 --> 08:48.999
pals. What's he like to live with?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.679
Hellish, I imagine.
I'm never bored.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.640
Good. That's good, isn't it?

09:02.080 --> 09:06.599
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.679
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning

09:09.680 --> 09:11.319
with his head smashed in.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.119
Jumped in front of a train?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.919
Seems the logical assumption.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.719
But?
But?

09:18.720 --> 09:21.439
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.439
Hah!

09:22.440 --> 09:27.039
The MoD is working on a new missile defence
system, the Bruce-Partington Program it's called.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.479
The plans for it
were on a memory stick.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.400
That wasn't very clever.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.959
It's not the only copy. Oh.
But it is secret.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.159
And missing.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.519
Top secret?

09:38.520 --> 09:41.999
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.359
We can't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.239
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.

09:47.240 --> 09:52.359
Don't make me order you.
I'd like to see you try.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.840
Think it over.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.279
Goodbye, John.
Mm.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.360
See you very soon.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.480
REPEATS RAPID PHRASE

10:11.760 --> 10:14.719

DOOR SHUTS

10:18.400 --> 10:19.879
You've got nothing on.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.679
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.919
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy? Why shouldn't I?

10:25.920 --> 10:27.560
Oh.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.760
Nice.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.119
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.880
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

10:40.320 --> 10:41.800
Sherlock Holmes.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.959
Of course. How could I refuse?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.639
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.239
Coming?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.920
If you want me to. Of course.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.200
I'd be lost without my blogger.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.719
'You like the funny cases,
don't you?'

11:15.720 --> 11:18.279
The surprising ones.
Obviously.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.999
You'll love this. That explosion.
Gas leak, yes? No.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.719
No? No. Made to look like one.
What?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.999
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.199
A VERY strong box,
and inside it was this.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.079
You haven't opened it?
It's addressed to you, isn't it?

11:34.080 --> 11:38.040
We've X-rayed it. It's not
booby-trapped. How reassuring.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.879
Nice stationery.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.959
Bohemian.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.479
What?

11:52.480 --> 11:55.079
From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.719
No.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.519
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, iridium nib.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.999
She?
Obviously.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.640
Obviously.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.279
But that... That's the phone.
The pink phone.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.879
What, from The Study In Pink? Obviously, it's not
the same phone, but it's supposed to look like...

12:26.880 --> 12:29.479
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?

12:29.480 --> 12:31.159
Of course. We all do.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.959
Do you REALLY not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?

12:33.960 --> 12:35.000
SHE SNIGGERS

12:37.680 --> 12:41.519
It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand-new.

12:41.520 --> 12:48.480
Someone's taken trouble to make it look the same,
which means your blog has a far wider readership.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.399
'You have one new message.'

12:51.400 --> 12:57.079
FIVE GREENWICH TIME SIGNAL PIPS

12:57.080 --> 13:00.279
Was that it?
No, that's not it.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.320
PHONE BEEPS

13:04.720 --> 13:07.039
What the hell
are we supposed to make of that?

13:07.040 --> 13:10.959
An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.559
It's a warning.
A warning?

13:14.560 --> 13:18.199
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,

13:18.200 --> 13:21.520
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.719
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.159
I've seen this place before.
Hang on.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.280
What's going to happen again?
Boom!

13:50.760 --> 13:52.920
Mrs Hudson!

13:55.800 --> 13:59.599
You had a look, didn't you, when you
first came to see about your flat?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.279
The door's been opened, recently.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.160
No, can't be. That's the only key.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.919
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.759
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

14:09.760 --> 14:13.560
I'd a place once when I was first
married. Mould all up the wall...

14:15.440 --> 14:17.360
Oh. Dear me.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.360
Shoes.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.360

Nothing. No, what did you mean?

Hmm?

16:50.041 --> 16:52.679
Woman on the phone -
the crying woman.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.959
Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.520
I wasn't thinking about leads. You're
not going to be much use to her.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.479

trace the call?

17:04.480 --> 17:07.079

Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.439
Must be important. Then why didn't
he cancel his dental appointment?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.839

Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

You've put on 3lb since I last saw you.

Two-and-a-half. No, three.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.679
Sherlock.
He's not gay!

19:14.680 --> 19:18.519
Why do you have to spoil...? He's
not! With that level of grooming?

19:18.520 --> 19:21.679
Because he puts product in his
hair? I put product in my hair.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.200
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

19:23.201 --> 19:26.639
Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines,

19:26.640 --> 19:28.639
those tired, clubber's eyes.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.520
Then there's his underwear.
His underwear?

19:30.521 --> 19:33.479
Visible above the waistline.
Very particular brand.

19:33.480 --> 19:37.439
Plus the suggestive fact that he
left his number under this dish.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.640

now and save yourself the pain.

Kinder? No, no, Sherlock,
that wasn't kind.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.919
Go on, then.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.559
Hm?

19:58.560 --> 20:00.519
You know what I do. Off you go.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.999

trainers. Good.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.160
Um...

20:26.600 --> 20:30.239
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

20:30.240 --> 20:35.239
except the sole has been well worn, so the
owner must have had them for a while.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.319
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.639
You're on sparkling form.
What else?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.599
They're quite big. A man's.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.080
But...

20:47.680 --> 20:50.840
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.079
Adults don't write their names inside
their shoes, so these belong to a kid.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.359
Excellent. What else?

20:58.360 --> 21:00.039
Er...

21:00.040 --> 21:03.039
That's it.
That's it.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.639
How did I do?
Well, John.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.639
Really well.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.680
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

21:12.280 --> 21:14.399
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.799
Whitened them. Changed the laces
three...no, four times.

21:17.800 --> 21:23.199
There are traces of flaky skin where his fingers
have come into contact with them, so he had eczema.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.679
The shoes are more worn on the
inner side, so he had weak arches.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.239
British-made, 20 years old.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.239
20 years? They're not retro,
they're original.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.439
Limited edition -
two blue stripes, 1989.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.159
There's still mud on them.
They look new.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.039
Someone's kept them that way.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.119
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.239
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.159
How do you know? Pollen. Clear as a
map reference. South of the river.

21:48.160 --> 21:53.239
This kid came to London from Sussex 20 years ago and
left the trainers behind. What happened to him?

21:53.240 --> 21:54.879
Something bad.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.959
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.959
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.760

22:05.880 --> 22:06.880

22:19.200 --> 22:20.720
It's where I began.

22:24.760 --> 22:30.159
1989, kid, champion swimmer, came from Brighton for
a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.319
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it. But you remember.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.039
Yes. Something fishy about it?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.719
Nobody thought so.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.439
Nobody except me. I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.959
You started young, didn't you?
The boy, Carl Powers,

22:43.960 --> 22:45.879
had some kind of fit in the water,

22:45.880 --> 22:48.320
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

22:48.321 --> 22:51.759
There was something wrong somewhere.
I couldn't get it out of my head.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.719
What? His shoes. What about them?
They weren't there. I made a fuss.

22:55.720 --> 23:00.399
I tried to get the police interested, but
nobody seemed to think it was important.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.760
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his
locker, but there was no sign of his shoes.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.679
Your brother sent me to collect
more facts

24:30.680 --> 24:34.439
about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.

Yes. He's investigating now.

Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.559

24:52.560 --> 24:56.319
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington

24:56.320 --> 25:01.039
Security checks A-OK.
No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.359
Westie!

25:13.360 --> 25:17.639
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.079
No.
What?

25:20.080 --> 25:22.520
He had an Oyster card...

25:24.000 --> 25:26.959
..but it hadn't been used.
He must have bought a ticket.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.479
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.

25:30.480 --> 25:34.399
Then... How did he end up with a bashed-in
brain on the tracks at Battersea?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.839
That is the question -

25:35.840 --> 25:39.439

would provide an answer to.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.039
Remember the shoelaces?
Mmm.

26:17.040 --> 26:21.639
He suffered from eczema. It would be easy to
introduce the poison into his medication.

26:21.640 --> 26:26.359
Two hours later he comes to London, the
poison paralyses the muscles and he drowns.

26:26.360 --> 26:31.160
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?
It's virtually undetectable. Nobody was looking for it.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.519
There are still tiny traces of it
in the trainers

26:35.520 --> 26:38.480

28:48.680 --> 28:51.759
so I stopped him laughing.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.839

It's the sounds of life, Sherlock.

We've found it.

29:49.560 --> 29:54.079
The car was hired yesterday morning by
an Ian Monkford. Banker of some kind.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.239
City boy. Paid in cash.

29:56.240 --> 29:59.479
Told his wife he was going away
on a business trip, never arrived.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.359
You're still hanging round him.
Yeah, well...

Mrs Monkford...

30:24.601 --> 30:28.399
Yes. Sorry, but I've already spoken
with two policemen.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.280
We're not from the police, we're...

Very old friend of your husband's.

30:37.800 --> 30:42.239
I'm sorry. Who? I don't think
he ever mentioned you.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.439
Oh, he must have done. This is...

30:44.440 --> 30:47.439
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.359
I only saw him the other day.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.879
Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.

30:51.880 --> 30:58.160
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?

30:59.360 --> 31:04.399
Really strange that he hired a car. Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

31:04.400 --> 31:07.679
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.159
Ah, well! That was Ian.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.799
That was Ian all over.
No, it wasn't.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.520
NORMAL VOICE: Wasn't it? Interesting.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.400
Who was that?
Why did you lie to her?

31:19.401 --> 31:24.359
People don't like telling you things but they love
to contradict you. Past tense, did you notice?

31:24.360 --> 31:26.560
What? I referred to her husband
in the past tense.

31:26.561 --> 31:31.519
She joined in. Bit premature. They've only just found the car.
You think she murdered her husband?

31:31.520 --> 31:34.479
That's not a mistake
a murderer would make. I see...

31:34.480 --> 31:36.879
No, I don't. What am I seeing?

Yeah, lovely motor.

Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.999

No, they're all Jags.

a Mazda, I mean. Yeah, fair point.

No, he was just a client.

32:20.801 --> 32:23.199
He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.399
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod!

would love it, though - bit of sun.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.918
How much? About a pint.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.719
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.879
The blood's Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.438
Frozen?
There are clear signs.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.679
I think Ian Monkford gave
a pint of his blood some time ago

34:41.679 --> 34:46.199
and that's what they spread on the seat.
Who did? Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

Exactly.

Ian Monkford was in trouble - financial at a
guess, he's a banker - couldn't see a way out.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.839
But if he were to vanish,

35:03.840 --> 35:07.359
if the car he hired was found with
his blood on the driver's seat...

35:07.360 --> 35:10.039
So where is he?
Colombia. Colombia?!

35:10.040 --> 35:12.399
Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,

35:12.400 --> 35:14.999
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.479
Quite a bit of change, too.

35:17.480 --> 35:20.239
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,

35:20.240 --> 35:23.999

I could see his tan line clearly.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.480
No-one wears a shirt on a sun bed.

35:25.481 --> 35:27.439
That, plus his arm. His arm?

35:27.440 --> 35:30.759
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.799
He'd recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably.
Hard to tell at that distance.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.679
He's just back from settling Ian
Monkford into his new life in Colombia.

Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

43:27.880 --> 43:30.959
The fan site's indispensable
for gossip.

43:30.960 --> 43:35.319

It's more common
than people think.

43:39.881 --> 43:44.279
The tetanus is in the soil, people cut
themselves on rose bushes, garden forks,

43:44.280 --> 43:48.639
that sort of thing,
and if left un...treated...

43:48.640 --> 43:52.639
I don't know
what I'm going to do now. Right.

43:52.640 --> 43:57.160
I mean, she's left me this place...
which is lovely...

43:58.960 --> 44:02.279
..but it's not the same without her.
That's why...

44:02.280 --> 44:07.599
my paper wanted to get the, um...
the full story straight from the horse's mouth.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.399
Are you sure it's not too soon?

44:09.400 --> 44:11.559
No. Right.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.839

'You'll need to pick up

Yes.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.119
Very good to meet you.
Yes, thank you.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.679
So sorry to hear about...
Yes, yes, very kind.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.359

44:45.360 --> 44:48.079
You were right, the bacteria
got into her another way.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.719
Oh, yes? Yes.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.600
Right, are we all set?
Er, yes. Shall we, um...?

the Egyptian goddess.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.439
How nice. Was she Connie's?

45:04.440 --> 45:06.520
Yes, a little present
from yours truly.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.279

What are you playing at? Sorry!

45:14.480 --> 45:17.999
You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy,
you two! What's going on?

45:18.000 --> 45:21.959
I think we've got what we came for.
Excuse us. What? Sherlock. What?

45:21.960 --> 45:25.000
We've got deadlines.
But you've not taken anything!

45:29.160 --> 45:31.239
Yes! Ooh, yes!

45:31.240 --> 45:34.159
You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.

45:34.160 --> 45:38.239
What? Yes. Yeah, it is. It must be.
It's how he got the tetanus into her system.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.879
Its paws stink of disinfectant.
Lovely idea.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.319
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.319
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.439
A scratch is almost inevitable.

45:48.440 --> 45:53.559
I thought of it when I saw the scratches on her arm,
but it's too random and clever for the brother.

45:53.560 --> 45:57.479
He murdered his sister for her
money. Did he? Didn't he?

45:57.480 --> 45:59.159
Nope. It was revenge.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.559
Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
Raoul, the houseboy.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.239
Kenny Prince was the butt
of his sister's jokes.

46:04.240 --> 46:09.359
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally, he had enough,
fell out with her badly. It's all on the website.

46:09.360 --> 46:13.959
She threatened to disinherit Kenny, Raoul had grown
accustomed to a certain lifestyle... Wait. Wait!

46:13.960 --> 46:17.399
Wait a second. What about the
disinfectant on the cat's claws?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.840
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,

46:19.841 --> 46:22.519
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

46:22.520 --> 46:25.519
You smell of disinfectant.
No, the cat doesn't come into it.

46:25.520 --> 46:29.040
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.

CLOCK TICKS

46:38.400 --> 46:40.359
Raoul de Santos is your killer.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.239
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.639
Second autopsy shows it wasn't
tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince,

46:45.640 --> 46:47.879
it was botulinum toxin.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.399
We've been here before.
Carl Powers. Tut-tut.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.319
Our bomber's repeated himself.
So how'd he do it?

46:53.320 --> 46:55.239
Botox injection. Botox?

46:55.240 --> 46:57.799
Botox is a diluted form
of botulinum. Among other things,

46:57.800 --> 47:01.799
Raoul de Santos was employed to give
Connie her regular facial injections.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.759
My contact at the Home Office gave me the
complete records of Raoul's internet purchases.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.520
He's been bulk-ordering Botox
for months.

47:07.521 --> 47:10.399
Bided his time, then upped
the strength to a fatal dose.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.079
Are you sure about this? I'm sure.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.759
All right, my office.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.639
Hey, Sherlock, how long? What?

47:15.640 --> 47:18.319
How long have you known?
Well, this one was quite simple.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.480
And the bomber repeated himself.
That was a mistake.

47:20.481 --> 47:23.480
No, but Sherlock, the hostage, the old
woman, she's been there all this time!

47:23.481 --> 47:26.919
I knew I could save her.
I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.639
I solved the case quickly, that gave
me time to get on with other things.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.680

REPORTER: 'The explosion,

48:31.240 --> 48:34.479
'which ripped through several

48:36.801 --> 48:39.799
'A spokesman
from the utility company...'

48:39.800 --> 48:42.239
He certainly gets about.

48:42.240 --> 48:44.519
Well, obviously I lost that round.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.360
Although technically,
I did solve the case.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.639
He killed the old lady
because she started to describe him.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.639
Just once,
he put himself in the firing line.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.119
What d'you mean?

48:58.120 --> 49:01.719
Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.519
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

49:05.520 --> 49:10.799
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

49:10.800 --> 49:14.919
So, people come to him wanting their
crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?

49:14.920 --> 49:15.960

Anything on the Carl Powers case?

49:39.840 --> 49:42.119
Nothing.

49:42.120 --> 49:45.439
All the living classmates
check out spotless, no connection.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.559
Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
The thought had occurred.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.199
So why is he doing this, then?

49:50.200 --> 49:53.999
Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?

49:54.000 --> 49:57.439
I think he wants to be distracted.
Oh...

49:57.440 --> 50:00.319
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

50:00.320 --> 50:04.839
Sorry, what?
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

50:04.840 --> 50:08.199
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?

50:08.200 --> 50:11.199
Will caring about them
help save them? Nope.

50:11.200 --> 50:14.919
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
And you find that easy, do you? Yes, very.

50:14.920 --> 50:18.600
Is that news to you? No, no.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.239
I've disappointed you.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.599
That's good,
that's a good deduction, yeah.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.480
Don't make people into heroes, John.

50:26.481 --> 50:30.759
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

You check the papers,
I'll look online.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.119
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

BIRDSONG

51:52.240 --> 51:54.440
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

51:54.441 --> 51:57.119
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

51:57.120 --> 52:00.479
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

52:00.480 --> 52:01.799
Yes.

52:01.800 --> 52:05.119
Any ideas? Seven, so far.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.600
Seven?

52:36.400 --> 52:39.599
He's dead about 24 hours.

52:39.600 --> 52:43.159
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

52:43.160 --> 52:46.439
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated.

52:46.440 --> 52:48.079
Yes, I'd agree.

52:48.080 --> 52:52.360
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.159
More bruises...

52:56.160 --> 52:58.440
here and here.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.680
Fingertips.

53:05.240 --> 53:08.719
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

53:08.720 --> 53:13.479
He's been in the river a long while, the
water's destroyed most of the data.

53:13.480 --> 53:17.599
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.679
What?
We need to identify the corpse,

53:19.680 --> 53:21.159
find out about his friends and...

53:21.160 --> 53:23.639
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?

53:23.640 --> 53:25.840
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

53:25.841 --> 53:28.479
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.079
Now it's turned up,
worth Â£30 million.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.759
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

53:33.760 --> 53:35.399
Everything.

53:35.400 --> 53:38.239
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Golem?

53:38.240 --> 53:40.680
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

53:40.681 --> 53:44.639
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of
clay - it's also the name of an assassin.

53:44.640 --> 53:47.759
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.759
That is his trademark style.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.639
So this is a hit? Definitely.

53:51.640 --> 53:54.879
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

53:54.880 --> 53:57.719
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

53:57.720 --> 53:59.399
You do see, you just don't observe!

53:59.400 --> 54:01.160
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

54:01.161 --> 54:05.400
Sherlock, do you want to
take us through it?

54:08.120 --> 54:11.039
What do we know about this corpse?

54:11.040 --> 54:14.559
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.840
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

54:16.841 --> 54:20.759
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.519
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue uniform.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.320
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?

54:25.321 --> 54:28.079
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.879
Tube driver?

54:29.880 --> 54:31.599
Security guard? More likely.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.679
That'll be borne out
by his backside. Backside?!

54:33.680 --> 54:35.919
Flabby, you'd think he'd led
a sedentary life.

54:35.920 --> 54:40.479
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent
varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

54:40.480 --> 54:44.239
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.

54:44.240 --> 54:46.680
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

54:46.681 --> 54:48.759
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

54:48.760 --> 54:51.399
Maybe he just set his alarm
like that the night before he died.

54:51.400 --> 54:54.599
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.

54:54.600 --> 54:57.159
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never varied.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.879
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,

54:58.880 --> 55:00.519
otherwise he would have
stripped the corpse completely.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.720
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

55:02.721 --> 55:05.959
that he tore off, suggesting the dead
man works somewhere recognisable,

55:05.960 --> 55:07.599
some kind of institution.

55:07.600 --> 55:11.439
I found this
inside his trouser pockets.

55:11.440 --> 55:15.199
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

55:15.200 --> 55:18.519
Tickets? Ticket stubs. He worked in a
museum or gallery. Did a quick check.

55:18.520 --> 55:22.719
The Hickman Gallery has reported one of its
attendants as missing - Alex Woodbridge.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.599
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.759
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

55:27.760 --> 55:30.959
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

55:30.960 --> 55:33.199
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

55:33.200 --> 55:36.199
something that would stop the owner
getting paid Â£30 million.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.959
The pictures are fake. Fantastic.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.200
Meretricious. And a Happy New Year.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
Poor sod.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.439
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.920
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

55:50.921 --> 55:53.120
Who? Me.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.640
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

56:05.080 --> 56:07.959
Waterloo Bridge.
Where now, the gallery?

of an old master? Don't know.

56:14.440 --> 56:17.519
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

56:17.520 --> 56:18.960

56:36.120 --> 56:37.239
Stop!

56:37.240 --> 56:39.439

56:39.440 --> 56:41.559
I won't be a moment.

56:41.560 --> 56:43.040

56:50.080 --> 56:52.719
Change? Any change?

56:52.720 --> 56:55.639

56:57.920 --> 56:59.640
Thanks.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.760
What are you doing? Investing.

57:13.720 --> 57:17.360
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash?

57:30.640 --> 57:34.239
No, I need you to find out all
you can about the gallery attendant.

57:34.240 --> 57:38.080
Lestrade will give you the address.
OK.

57:51.040 --> 57:53.599
We'd been sharing about a year.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.760
Just sharing. Mmm.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.120
May I? Yeah.

58:10.640 --> 58:13.039
Sorry.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.759
Stargazer, was he?

58:14.760 --> 58:17.559
God, yeah. Mad about it.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.279
It's all he ever did
in his spare time.

58:20.280 --> 58:22.759
He was a nice guy, Alex.

58:22.760 --> 58:25.759
I liked him.

58:25.760 --> 58:28.119
He was, er...

58:28.120 --> 58:30.280
never much of a one for hoovering.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.519
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

58:35.520 --> 58:38.079
It was just a job, you know?

58:38.080 --> 58:39.280
Mmm.

58:41.840 --> 58:45.319
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

58:45.320 --> 58:46.519
No.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.959
We had a break-in, though.

58:48.960 --> 58:50.839
When? Last night.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.959
There was nothing taken.

58:52.960 --> 58:57.919
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

58:57.920 --> 59:02.440

Lovely. Now get back to work -
we open tonight.

Doesn't it bother you? What?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.239
That the painting's a fake.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.119
What? It's a fake. It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.679
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas? Who are you?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.759
Alex Woodbridge
knew that the painting was a fake,

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.679
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.640
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

01:00:21.641 --> 01:00:24.399
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.879
It's not a fake.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.679
It is a fake. I don't know why.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.960
But there's something wrong with it,
there has to be.

01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:33.999
What the hell are you on about? You know I could
have you sacked on the spot. Not a problem.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.799
No? No, I don't work here, you see.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.080
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:39.799
How did you get in?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.999
Please! I want to know.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.319

how to hide in plain sight.

Stranger things have happened.
Westie wasn't a traitor.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.919
That's a horrible thing to say!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.759
I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.439
That's what they think, isn't it,
his bosses?

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.999
He was young man, about to
get married, he had debts.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.759
Everyone's got debts,

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.159
and Westie wouldn't want to clear
them by selling out his country.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.399
Can you, er...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.519
We were having a night in.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.519
Just...watching a DVD.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.960
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.360
He was quiet.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.079
Out of the blue he said
he just had to go and see someone.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.320
And you've no idea who?

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.759
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.919
Yeah. Who's this?

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.559
John Watson, hi.
This is my brother, Joe.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.800
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.079
You with the police?
Sort of, yeah.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.039
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.520
I'll do my best.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.759

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.599
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.160
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.559
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.040
He was MY good man.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.199
Spare change? No.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.600
Any spare change?

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.959
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.599
And? And...

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.159
Is that it?
No habits, hobbies, personality?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.439
Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.879

sir? Don't mind if I do.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.600
WATSON: Can you wait here?

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.120
Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.720
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.359
I thought you didn't care about...
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.159
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message
on the answerphone at his flat.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.159
A Professor Cairns. This way.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.520
Nice. Nice part of town.

Homeless network.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.799
Really is indispensable.
Homeless network?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.199

Ah, that's...clever.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.200

Yes, then disinfect myself.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.599
Well, he has a very distinctive look.
He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wag...much.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.759
Oh sh... What?

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.920

he might be going.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.559
accessory after the fact,
at the very least.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.960
The murder of the old woman,
all the people in the flat...

01:10:16.961 --> 01:10:19.359
I didn't know anything about that.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.000
All those things, please,
believe me.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.799
I just wanted my share.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.320
The 30 million.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.919
SHE SIGHS

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.080
I found a little old man in
Argentina.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.959
A genius - I mean, really.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.919
Brushwork, immaculate.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.519
Could fool anyone. Mmm.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.040
Well, nearly anyone.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.200
But I didn't know how to go about convincing
the world the picture was genuine.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.520
It was just an idea.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.759
A spark which he blew into a flame.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.479
Who?

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.079
I don't know.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.639
LESTRADE LAUGHS It's true!

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.319
It took a long time,
but eventually I was...

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.120
put in touch with people.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.760
His people...

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.560
Well, there was never any real
contact.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.440
Just messages...

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.559
..whispers.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.800
And did those whispers have a name?

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.800
Moriarty.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.759
WATSON: So this is where West was
found? Yeah.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.119
Are you going to be long?
I might be.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.119
Are you the police, then?
Sort of.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.959
I hate 'em. The police?

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.559
No, jumpers.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.279
People who chuck 'emselves in
front of trains. Selfish bastards.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.079
Well, that's one way of looking
at it.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.559
I mean it. It's all right for them.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.519
It's over in a split second, strawberry jam all
over the lines. What about the drivers, eh?

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.679
They've got to live with it,
haven't they?

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.679
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.359
Has it been cleaned off?
No, there wasn't that much.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.840
You said his head was smashed in.
It was, but there wasn't much blood.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.479
OK.
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.839
Just give us a shout when
you're off. Right.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:13:00.679
Right, so, Andrew West...got on
the train somewhere. Or did he?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.320
There was no ticket on the body.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.759
How did he end up here?

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.320
CLANKING

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.719
The points. Yes!

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.959
I knew you'd get there eventually.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.599
West wasn't killed here, that's
why there was so little blood.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.840
How long have you been following
me? Since the start.

01:13:22.841 --> 01:13:25.759
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.639
just to spite my brother, do you?

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.040
Come on,
we've got a bit of burglary to do.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.439
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.079
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.359
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.599
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.119
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.760
or doesn't know what to do with it.

01:13:49.761 --> 01:13:51.639
My money's on the latter.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.239
We're here.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.880
Where?

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.960
Sherlock! What if there's
someone in?

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.680
There isn't.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.680
WATSON: Jesus...

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.519
Where are we? Oh, sorry, didn't
I say? Joe Harrison's flat.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.000
Joe...?

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.159
Brother of West's fiancee.
He stole the memory stick,

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.480
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.559
Then why did he do it?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.519
KEYS RATTLING

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.040
Let's ask him.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.760
Don't! Don't.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
He wasn't meant to...

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.759
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.040
Why did you kill him?

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:18.239
It was an accident. I swear it was.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.159
But stealing the plans for the missile
defence program wasn't an accident, was it?

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.320
I started dealing drugs.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.239
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.799
I don't know how it started.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.239
I just got out of my depth.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.679
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.320
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.399
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.279
'But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.559
'He told me about these
missile plans.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.239
'Beyond top secret.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.119
'He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.'

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.879
You hear about these things
getting lost,

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.919
ending up on rubbish tips
and whatnot.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.239
But there it was. And I thought...

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.279
'Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.320
'It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.'

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.199
Next time I saw him,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.479
'I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.'

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.479
What are you doing here?
What have you done with the plans?

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.080
What happened?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.319
'I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.719
'I just didn't have a clue what
to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.000
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.440
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.679
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.
His body would have gone on for ages

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.759
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track that curved.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.880
And points. Exactly.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.120
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.640
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.199
Distraction over -
the game continues.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.839
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.280
Five pips, remember, John.

01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:13.119
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.679
SHOUTING ON TELEVISION

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.319
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.520
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.839
I knew it was dangerous. Hm?

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.999
Getting you into crap telly.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.799
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.199
Have you given Mycroft the memory
stick yet? Yep. He was over the moon.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.040
Threatened me with a
knighthood...again.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.799
You know, I'm still waiting. Hm?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.759
For you to admit that a little
knowledge of the solar system

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.359
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.959
It didn't do you any good, did it?

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.519
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.199
True. I won't be in for tea.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.319
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still some
of that risotto left in the fridge.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.919
Milk, we need milk. I'll get some.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.680
Really? Really.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.560
And some beans, then? Mm.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.200
DOOR CLOSES

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.600
FOOTSTEPS

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.639
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.200
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.119
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.520
All to distract me from this.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.120
Evening.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.679
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.840
John! What the hell...?
Bet you never saw this coming.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.280
What...would you like me
to make him say...next?

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.239
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.199
gottle o' gear. Stop it.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.479
Nice touch, this. The pool,

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.999
where little Carl died.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.719
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.599
Stop his heart. Who are you?

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.039
DOOR OPENS

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.759
I gave you my number.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.360
I thought you might call.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.999
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.520
or are you just pleased to see me?

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.840
Both.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.400
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.799
Jim?

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.920
Jim from the hospital?

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.079
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.440
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.719
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.760
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.319
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.999
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.399
I'm a specialist, you see.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.039
Like you.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.520
Dear Jim...

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.759
..please will you fix it for me

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.039
to get rid of my lover's
nasty sister?

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.879
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for
me to disappear to South America?

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.479
Just so.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.559
Consulting criminal.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.399
Brilliant. Isn't it?

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.320
No-one ever gets to me.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.799
And no-one ever will.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.000
I did.
COCKS GUN

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.319
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.160
Thank you.
Didn't mean it as a compliment.

01:23:31.161 --> 01:23:33.319
Yes, you did. Yeah, OK, I did.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.079
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.039
SINGSONG
Daddy's had enough now.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.519
I've shown you what I can do.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.439
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.199
even 30 million quid, just
to get you to come out and play.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.359
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.080
Back off.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.399
Although I have loved this,

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.319
this little game of ours.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.959
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.
Did you like the little touch with the underwear?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.760
People have died.
That's what people do!

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.599
I will stop you. No, you won't.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.960
Are you all right?

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.119
You can talk, Johnny boy.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.519
Go ahead.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.240
Take it. Mm? Oh...

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.600
..that? The missile plans.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.199
Boring!

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.239
I could have got them anywhere.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.639
Sherlock, run!

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.159
HE LAUGHS Good!

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.439
Very good.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.639
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.119
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.039
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.959
They're so touchingly loyal.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.200
But oops!

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.000
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.880
Gotcha.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.079
Westwood. Do you know what happens if you
don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you?

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.919
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.439
Kill you?

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.839
No, don't be obvious.
I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.719
I don't want to rush it, though.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.919
I'm saving it up for
something special.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:42.920
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:49.920
I'll burn the heart out of you.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.679
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.680
But we both know that's not
quite true.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.959
Well, I'd better be off.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.239
Well, so nice to have had a
proper chat.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.079
What if I was to shoot you now?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.399
Right now?

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.680
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.479
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.199
Really, I would.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.840
And just a teensy
bit...disappointed.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.960
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.000
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.280
Catch you...later.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.240
No, you won't!
DOOR CLOSES

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.079
All right? Are you all right?

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.239
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.080
Sherlock!

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.440
HE GASPS

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.280
Oh, Christ.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.280
Are you OK?
Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.719
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.240
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.719
I'm glad no-one saw that. Mm?

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.799
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.880
People might talk.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.720
They do little else.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.799
Oh...
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.559
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.359
it is my only weakness.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.200
You can't be allowed to continue.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.799
You just can't.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.359
I would try to convince you,

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.240
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.480
Probably my answer has
crossed yours.
