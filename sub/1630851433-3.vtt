WEBVTT

00:51.342 --> 00:55.180
Celery sticks and hummus,
whole-grain crackers,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.850
seedless grapes
if they're over the age of 2.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.395
Low-fat Greek yogurt
with granola and berries.

01:03.146 --> 01:08.693
Some string cheeses,
bananas, kiwis, pears.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.362
Is this motherfucker just gonna
keep listing fruits?

01:12.906 --> 01:18.036
Blueberries, tangerines,
and apples with peanut butter.

01:24.334 --> 01:29.214
Okay, moms, what's a healthy snack
we can give Jimmy

01:29.297 --> 01:31.633
from anywhere on the food pyramid?

01:32.383 --> 01:34.344
-Yes.
-Uh, trail mix?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.638
Actually, be careful with trail mix,

01:36.721 --> 01:40.308
especially if it's store-bought
and comes mixed with candies.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.603
So you're gonna want
a full nut-and-berry trail mix.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.607
Oh. Moms, that's our time for today.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.736
But remember, kids need
three healthy meals a day, every day.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.447
Parents do not get a day off.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.138
-Hi.
-Hey there, sweetie.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.140
Ready to rock and roll.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.313
-How was class?
-He made us put diapers on a melon.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
Gary.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.985
-Why do I have to do this?
-It's court-mandated.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.155
Parents who have lost custody
have to do PEP class.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.032
Yolanda offered me a shift this morning,
and I turned it down

02:38.116 --> 02:39.826
to learn about whole grains.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.872
Completing the class will look
very good at your hearing.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.374
If it helps get Maddy,
I'm gonna be the valedictorian

02:46.457 --> 02:47.542
of Bad Mom School.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.253
That's for you.

02:52.964 --> 02:56.801
-You brought me a coffee?
-It's just Folgers, baby girl.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.516
There he is.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.770
-Howie, hi.
-Dee.

03:07.854 --> 03:12.317
-Always lovely. Is this Alex?
-Yes, sir. Thank you so much.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.360
I really, really appreciate this.
Thank you.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.570
Oh, please.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.322
Call me Howie.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.617
Howie's been donating
his Wednesday lunch hour

03:20.700 --> 03:22.410
to McMullen House for years.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.995
His wife makes him do it.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.915
She does not. She just likes me
slightly more when I do.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.708
I have to state this upfront.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.211
I don't practice family law
and I don't represent you.

03:31.294 --> 03:36.424
I'm an estate lawyer, giving free legal
counsel in a field I'm not an expert in.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.135
I appreciate any advice
I can get, thank you.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.555
-Denise says you're back in court Friday?
-Yes.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.183
How involved are you
in your daughter's day-to-day care?

03:45.266 --> 03:47.810
-I am her day-to-day care.
-That's good.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.147
That's very good.
It's gonna help you get joint custody.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.901
No, I don't want joint custody.
I want Maddy all the time.

03:54.984 --> 03:59.822
Didn't you take her from her home
for 72 hours without her father's consent?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.074
For her own good.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.119
It doesn't matter.
You can't take a child away like that.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.456
It's grounds for losing custody.
It's his word against yours.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.000
You know, Howie believes you, baby girl.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.794
Absolutely.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.255
But emotional abuse is tricky.

04:15.838 --> 04:20.510
Legally, it's not classified
as domestic abuse in this state.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.889
-Ass-backwards.
-All right, so I'm in a DV shelter,

04:24.973 --> 04:28.518
and the DV shelter says
emotional abuse is domestic violence.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.521
But the court says that it's not?

04:31.604 --> 04:32.730
Correct.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.191
So I'm fucked.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.319
No. We'll get you
a strong character witness.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.030
Do you have someone
who can speak on your behalf?

04:43.074 --> 04:44.075
Sure.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.577
What about permanent housing
in close proximity to Dad?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.705
Getting her
in transitional housing tomorrow.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.747
Good.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.959
File these forms with the clerk
no later than 7 p.m. tomorrow.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.669
I have to fill all this out

04:54.752 --> 04:57.088
and go to work and go
to mom class by 7 tomorrow?

04:57.171 --> 05:01.301
Yeah. The court needs proof
that you're enrolled in SNAP benefits.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.178
That's your food-stamp vouchers
and EBT card.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.432
You apply in person, and the wait is long.

05:07.515 --> 05:11.602
So go early. Bring proof of residency,
information about your income,

05:11.686 --> 05:15.690
the name of your voluntary
resettlement agency, VOLAG, if applicable.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.067
The court needs to see proof
of financial security,

05:18.151 --> 05:22.238
proof that the parent is employed
in a legal, income-generating...

05:22.322 --> 05:25.158
Court needs copies of pay stubs,
bank accounts, credit cards,

05:25.241 --> 05:28.244
rental lease and utility bills,
any ongoing medical costs.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.205
If you plan on taking advantage
of the WCCC childcare program,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.958
provided you meet all the TANF
WorkFirst requirements,

05:34.042 --> 05:36.753
the court needs to see
that verification paper.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.213
Same for LIHEAP.
You need proof of a support system.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.008
Extended family, friends,
emergency contact.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.509
Name, number, address.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.637
You need written testimonials
about your character,

05:46.721 --> 05:49.515
who can speak on your behalf,

05:49.599 --> 05:52.685
-say what a great mother you are.
-Fuck me!

05:55.688 --> 05:57.899
-Late!
-I know, I'm sorry. The B9 bus.

05:57.982 --> 06:01.402
I'm gonna start calling you Sorry.
Sorry, you're so sorry.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.489
Kiara's waiting outside.
You have a move-out in Merritt.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.742
-Who's Kiara? I haven't met her.
-I'll set up a lunch.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.952
We'll have the Cobb salad and rosé.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.246
-Where are you going? No.
-To change.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.624
No uniforms for move-out cleans.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.959
-What's a move-out clean?
-You'll see.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.380
Kiara?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.016
Your seat's wet.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.686
It looks like piss,
but it's Mountain Dew. Get in.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
Thank you so much
for the ride, by the way.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.158
Yolanda made me. But I can't
drive you home, so don't even ask.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.035
No, yeah, I'll take the bus.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.330
How a grown-ass woman doesn't
have her own wheels is the question.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.248
Yeah.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.253
I'm sorry, I've gotta
take this real quick.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.381
-Mom.
-Hey, Basil said you texted me.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.966
Why is Basil checking your phone?

07:05.049 --> 07:09.554
He was putting a Venmo app
on my phone and saw the text.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.556
Why was Basil putting Venmo on your phone?

07:11.639 --> 07:15.184
-That's your bank information.
-Don't start. I'm really busy.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.102
Doing what?

07:16.185 --> 07:19.981
Oh, I'm embroidering little tits
and vaginas onto T-shirts.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.817
-I got a big order on Esty.
-It's Etsy.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.902
Some sorority is doing a girl-power thing.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.406
A sorority is paying you
to embroider boobs and vaginas?

07:28.489 --> 07:32.076
Yep.
Embroidered tees are the new pussyhats.

07:32.160 --> 07:32.994
What's up?

07:33.077 --> 07:35.371
-Are you around tomorrow?
-Why?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.249
-What did you do with Grandma's furniture?
-Why?

07:38.332 --> 07:41.127
I'm moving.
I would love to use her furniture,

07:41.210 --> 07:45.339
-and I'd really love your truck.
-You're moving? Well, that's exciting.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.802
I saw Sean at the Penny Saver,
and he did not say a word.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.805
I'm not moving with Sean. I left him.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.809
-Was Maddy with him at the Penny Saver?
-No. He was on his bike.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.938
Okay. Uh... So can you help me tomorrow?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.024
With what?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.108
Moving.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.153
Alex, I really don't think
you should do that, hon.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.323
You don't leave
a good man when he's trying,

08:10.948 --> 08:13.910
and Sean is trying to evolve.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.246
-Okay, can I use your truck or not, Mom?
-Sure, kiddo.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.541
-What for?
-For the love of God, I'm moving tomorrow.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.089
Holy shit, what is that smell?

08:27.590 --> 08:30.718
Sewage. Squatters break in,
or tenants who get evicted

08:30.801 --> 08:33.471
but stay after the water
and electric is off.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.974
Keep using the toilet too.
Foul-ass motherfuckers.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.478
-I'm gonna be sick.
-Breathe through your mouth.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.689
You get the lay of the land.
I'm gonna get the wet-vac and supplies.

08:45.733 --> 08:46.567
Fuck.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.631
Hey! New girl, where you at?

09:09.131 --> 09:11.968
I'm in here. A kid was squatting here.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.930
-Who the fuck would do this to a child?
-It's character-building.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.932
Let's divvy this up.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.518
Dusting's where I shine,
so I'll take bedrooms.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.230
-You take the kitchen and the bathroom.
-Why do I get the worst rooms?

09:25.106 --> 09:25.940
You're new.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.504
No, he DM'd me, "DTF?"

09:49.380 --> 09:51.465
Huh?

09:54.635 --> 09:59.348
Huh? No, 'cause his old lady looks
like a house elf in Harry Potter.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.266
I know.

10:20.995 --> 10:25.249
No one plays mini golf,
he's gay! I'm telling you.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.372
I'm gonna have to call you back.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.249
You okay, newbie?

11:13.964 --> 11:15.716
Can't handle the heat, chef?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.810
I don't think I can do this.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.896
So quit. I'll tell Yolanda.

11:31.107 --> 11:31.982
I can't quit.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.780
Then don't quit. Either way,
toilet's not gonna clean itself.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.167
Son of a bitch,
are you fucking kidding me?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.377
Sorry! Do you mind if I get out?

13:28.224 --> 13:31.310
Could we get a drink
for this single dad over here?

13:31.393 --> 13:33.896
Jesus Christ, you're really helping...

13:34.313 --> 13:35.564
Where the fuck is Maddy?

13:35.648 --> 13:36.982
-Shit.
-Where is Maddy?

13:37.066 --> 13:40.069
-It's Alex Russell. All fun must cease.
-Talk to me. Where's Maddy?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.654
Relax. She's with my mom.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.239
Why do you have a vacuum?

13:43.697 --> 13:45.699
-Are you drunk?
-I'm working on it.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.701
-And you've been out all day biking?
-So?

13:47.785 --> 13:50.663
So Maddy's with your mom,
on the couch, watching Jeopardy?

13:50.746 --> 13:52.957
No, no, no. They watch Wheel of Fortune.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.500
-This is funny to you?
-Well...

13:54.583 --> 13:56.669
Are you kidding me, Sean?
What if she got sick?

13:56.752 --> 13:59.255
What if she got hurt?
What if she needed to go to the ER?

13:59.338 --> 14:00.756
My mom would take her.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.634
Your mom that spent half
your childhood addicted to Oxy?

14:03.717 --> 14:07.137
That's taking care of our daughter?
Talk to me, Sean!

14:07.221 --> 14:08.597
My mom's sober.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.725
-I don't get it!
-What don't you get?

14:11.809 --> 14:13.352
Maddy's a fucking baby.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.855
She's been with me
for every second of her life.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.859
Don't understand why you're gonna take her
if you're not gonna spend time with her.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.152
-Will you chill?
-I'm not gonna chill!

14:22.236 --> 14:24.238
-I'm having one round.
-Bullshit!

14:24.321 --> 14:25.573
Then I'm going home.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.950
You've had four rounds! Probably five!

14:28.033 --> 14:31.996
Alex, if I'm having a few drinks,
it's because I'm doing fucking triage.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.415
Okay? Everyone heard you say
I have a rage problem.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.626
-You do have a rage problem!
-Yeah, well, these people are my regulars.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.254
-You have a rage problem.
-Say that with a straight face.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.590
You have a rage problem
and a drinking problem,

14:42.673 --> 14:45.843
and you shouldn't have custody
if your mommy does it for you.

14:45.926 --> 14:50.139
The whole reason my mom is here
is because my girlfriend dumped me

14:50.222 --> 14:51.473
and then stole my kid

14:51.557 --> 14:55.144
and then she almost killed her
in a fucking car accident!

14:55.686 --> 14:57.062
This is an emergency.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.899
You are an emergency.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.695
And you smell like shit.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.536
-Sorry, guys.
-Don't worry, bro. Drink.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.801
-Hi.
-Is she asleep?

15:27.885 --> 15:28.844
Yes.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.263
Can I just see her?

15:44.485 --> 15:45.402
I love you.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.447
I love you so much.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.084
-Thanks, Doreen.
-Bye.

16:05.673 --> 16:11.011
So today I want to talk about stability.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.513
And whoosh!

16:14.682 --> 16:16.892
-Take these.
-Let's take a scenario.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.397
This is Chloe, age 4.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.484
Chloe lives at home with two parents

16:26.026 --> 16:30.614
who love her very, very much.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.616
And she has stability.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.327
She has three meals a day,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.789
snack at snack time, lights out at 7,

16:38.872 --> 16:41.500
and a day care
that she's very familiar with.

16:41.583 --> 16:46.630
But now... let's say
Chloe's parents separate suddenly, okay?

16:47.214 --> 16:50.300
Chloe now shuffles back and forth
between them,

16:50.801 --> 16:53.387
and that sense of home she had...

16:57.599 --> 16:58.642
Gone!

17:04.815 --> 17:05.649
Hmm.

17:06.817 --> 17:11.864
Chloe's chances of having emotional,
psychological, and academic difficulties

17:11.947 --> 17:15.951
are 55 percent higher
than they were before this.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.329
That's how important stability is.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.375
So, moms, what can we do?

17:23.459 --> 17:27.463
Let's help turn Chloe's frown upside down.
Okay?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.221
I have some amazing news!

17:37.973 --> 17:41.018
-You are gonna die when I tell you.
-Okay.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.354
Can we run a few errands in town
before we get the keys to my place?

17:44.438 --> 17:45.272
Sure!

17:47.232 --> 17:49.860
-So guess who I ran into.
-Who, Mom?

17:49.943 --> 17:51.779
-Fey!
-Who's Fey?

17:51.862 --> 17:56.116
Oh, baby, he is this genius curator
I met a million years ago.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.162
I can't remember where, but I think
it was at the artists' residence in Maine.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.290
Remember the time when I found
the cash on the street for my flight?

18:03.373 --> 18:08.921
I was like, "Oh, man, talk about karma!"
Anyway, he's here.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.299
-Who's here?
-Fey, the curator I met in Maine.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.219
He's running the Hummingbird,
and I ran into him.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.222
I'm here to apply for SNAP
for me and my daughter.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.224
Here's my application and my ID.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.769
And he was like,
"Paula Langley, is that you?"

18:23.852 --> 18:27.564
So I say, "Fey, do you realize

18:27.648 --> 18:30.150
the Hummingbird
has never given me a show?"

18:30.234 --> 18:33.237
I'm here to apply for LIHEAP.
My application and ID.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.156
And he was like,
"You've got to be kidding me."

18:36.240 --> 18:38.242
And how do I enroll in WCCC?

18:38.325 --> 18:42.538
I just tell him all about my new series,
and he says, "Bring it in."

18:42.621 --> 18:46.166
-Thank you.
-So maybe you didn't hear me.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.711
I'm having my own show.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.754
Who is?

18:51.296 --> 18:52.422
Me!

18:52.506 --> 18:56.552
They offered me a solo show
at the Hummingbird.

18:57.052 --> 19:00.055
Hey, that's really great.
That's great, Mom.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.766
Yeah, and it works out just perfectly.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.894
Because my favorite bronze is at Larry's.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.355
So we'll snag it when we're getting
Mom's furniture.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.400
And then we'll drop off the whole
kit and kaboodle at the gallery.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.402
-Today, no. We can't do that today.
-Yeah!

19:13.485 --> 19:15.863
It takes two to lift that sculpture.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.657
You help me and we scratch
each other's back.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.787
Right, because that's what today's
about, Mom. Hi. Are you Luis?

19:23.871 --> 19:27.624
I'm Alex, it's very nice to meet you.
This is my mother, Paula.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.169
Hola, Luis. Ooh!

19:30.752 --> 19:31.962
Okay. This way.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.047
-Can you not, please?

19:34.548 --> 19:37.426
Guest understands this is
an emergency shelter.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.802
It is not your home.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.639
Guest understands pay stubs
are to be submitted weekly.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.643
Any change of income or child support
must be reported immediately.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.980
Guest understands overnight visitors
are not allowed.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.317
Guest understands
random urinalysis may be requested.

19:54.401 --> 19:58.155
-Did you say I have to pee in a cup?
-Half the residents are recently homeless.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.074
The other half
are recently released from jail.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.161
So we have a strict no drugs
or alcohol policy here.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.621
So this is a halfway house?

20:05.704 --> 20:09.249
-Are there people on parole living here?
-Well, it's a lot of things, mama.

20:09.833 --> 20:14.254
Only subsidized housing in the county.
You sign here and here, okay?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.049
Just give us a second.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.638
I love it. It's got great bones.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.725
I can't bring Maddy here with ex-cons
living next door to us.

20:26.808 --> 20:27.768
Bullshit.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.730
We just need to brighten it up.
That's all. I will help you.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.273
It'll be fine.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.067
We'll get some house plants.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.737
We'll go by Larry's
and get Mom's old furniture.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.281
I'll have Basil drop off my paints.

20:41.365 --> 20:46.453
I'll paint a mural over Maddy's bed,
of monkeys and sunflowers!

20:46.536 --> 20:49.581
You know,
we'll just bring the sunshine right in.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.417
It'll be a real girl pad.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.127
It'll be okay.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.422
I just need you to fill in
these forms, Mom.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.759
-I have to turn them in by 7 tonight.
-Piece of cake.

21:00.842 --> 21:04.388
Just keep going straight
until you hit the dirt road.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.183
I know. I learned how to drive
on this road, Mom.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.936
Really? I don't remember that.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.563
Larry taught me in his Bronco.

21:13.647 --> 21:16.149
Weren't you in middle school
when we lived out here?

21:16.233 --> 21:19.528
Nope. I got picked up
for my junior prom out here.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.824
-In my senior year, we went to Craig's.
-Craig?

21:24.658 --> 21:28.287
Yeah. He lived down by the reservoir,
and he had a pet ferret.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.329
Oh.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.541
Craig. Shit, but you know...

21:33.750 --> 21:35.210
Larry was a good guy.

21:36.044 --> 21:40.090
Always trying to pin me down. Poor thing.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.890
It might be hard for him
to part with the obelisk,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.934
so let me take the lead on that.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.937
You know, people get
really attached to their art.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.566
We also have to get Grandma's furniture,
which is the reason that we're here.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.402
Yeah, yeah. So how do I look?

22:00.902 --> 22:02.362
Are my girls too out?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.114
You look good.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.115
-Oh!

22:05.198 --> 22:07.701
Oh, shit!

22:08.744 --> 22:11.830
-Good job, squirt.
-Oh, my God! What the hell!

22:13.832 --> 22:16.001
Sorry about Wicket.
That's the way he says hi.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.419
Hi, Larry.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.504
Is that Alex?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.382
Holy shit, sister, you're all grown up!

22:22.466 --> 22:23.550
Hi, Larry.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.720
Paula, would you look at you, huh?

22:27.554 --> 22:30.223
-It's been a minute.
-Cute grandson.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.559
Wicket? Oh, no, that's my son.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.394
Your son?

22:34.478 --> 22:38.231
Yeah, I got a couple of new additions
running around. They're with their mom.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.149
Up there!

22:39.232 --> 22:40.233
Say hi, Petal!

22:42.319 --> 22:44.279
She looks like a fucking bitch.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.865
Oh, Paula.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.786
So you ladies finally want
your old furniture back, huh?

22:50.869 --> 22:51.870
It's in the barn.

22:52.454 --> 22:57.876
Hey, look, Lar, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to take the obelisk.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.920
What's an obelisk?

23:01.296 --> 23:04.925
The bronze statue that I made
for you when you turned 45.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.802
Oh.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.387
It's a big, pointy thing.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.598
Oh. Oh.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.601
-You mean the big dick sculpture?
-That's the one.

23:15.102 --> 23:19.773
It's an obelisk. It's the ancient symbol
of the sun god, Ra.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.067
Yeah. I got that in the barn too.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.568
You keep it in the barn?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.489
That's a really important
early work of mine.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.367
Well, Petal moved in.
I had to make some space.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.954
Pull the truck up to the barn door,
will you, kiddo?

23:35.872 --> 23:38.166
Petal, that's not a name.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.043
Hey, it's my old softball bat.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.963
He told me that he would
never get married again,

23:43.046 --> 23:45.924
that he was too set in his ways.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.593
Why do you care, Mom?
You guys broke up a decade ago.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.429
I don't understand why you're upset.

23:50.512 --> 23:55.183
If he was gonna break his stupid
marriage rule, it should have been for me.

23:55.267 --> 24:00.772
-These are all my old journals.
-My ass was completely out in the wind.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.984
Moving my whole art studio into his house.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.902
And your daughter.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.364
-She's so young.
-So is Basil, Mom.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.451
This is great. Mom.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.619
-My God.
-I found it.

24:14.703 --> 24:18.665
-I can't believe he left it here.
-Is this gonna fit in the truck?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.292
Wow.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.378
-That dick's bigger than I remember.
-Are you blind?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.714
Nothing about that looks like a penis.

24:26.089 --> 24:29.551
Come on, Alex. You lift by the balls.
I'll take the shaft.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.972
-Is this the balls right here?
-Yep.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.146
Thanks for the help, Mom.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.482
Can we go now?

24:44.274 --> 24:46.985
-You're being very rude.
-Rude?

24:47.068 --> 24:50.071
What I am is running out of time
to find love, Alex,

24:50.155 --> 24:52.657
because I wasted time on that clown.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.159
Hey, Mom...

24:55.785 --> 24:58.330
we're about to drop your art at a gallery.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.041
You're a working artist.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.336
Life's good. You're good.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.672
You're right.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.508
There she goes.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.719
We're rescuing the obelisk
from the philistines,

25:12.802 --> 25:15.722
and now we're gonna
deliver it to superior people.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.059
Mm-hm.
You're gonna wave goodbye to this nice man

25:19.142 --> 25:21.394
who stored your stuff
for an entire decade, yep?

25:25.565 --> 25:28.401
Put a bra on, bitch.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.871
Can you please
fill out my form now?

25:43.083 --> 25:46.169
Write that I'm a good mom,
that I'm stable and able,

25:46.253 --> 25:47.754
that I take good care of Maddy.

25:47.837 --> 25:51.383
Give an example, sign it, that's it.
Please, this is very important.

25:51.466 --> 25:55.136
I have to turn this into court by 7 p.m.
or I could lose Maddy.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.056
Hey.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.520
-What do you want me to say?
-That I'm a good mom.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.314
That I take great care of Maddy.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.401
If you add that Sean is abusive,
that would be helpful.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.825
Sean?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.202
Emotional abuse is abuse.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.416
What does that even mean?
How can emotions be abused?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.376
Where do people get this stuff?

26:27.085 --> 26:30.422
All right. Did you notice
that we were in a bank earlier?

26:30.505 --> 26:32.924
-Yep.
-Did you notice what I was doing?

26:33.008 --> 26:34.259
Banking.

26:34.342 --> 26:37.429
I was opening a bank account
because I don't have one

26:37.512 --> 26:40.515
because Sean took my ATM card
when I didn't pay the electric bill

26:40.599 --> 26:42.392
and said he would handle all money.

26:42.475 --> 26:46.479
Honey, Sean's good with money,
and you're like me, shitty with it.

26:47.147 --> 26:51.610
Or I was isolated in a trailer
for two years without any access to money,

26:51.693 --> 26:54.821
and that's financial abuse,
a form of emotional abuse.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.449
Where are you getting this shit?
Your class?

26:57.532 --> 27:00.201
No. I'm getting this
from the DV shelter, Mom.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.622
This is why I don't go to the doctor,

27:03.705 --> 27:07.834
because if you start poking around
because you think something's wrong,

27:07.917 --> 27:09.753
you're gonna find something.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.422
That's an incredibly fucked-up
point of view.

27:12.505 --> 27:16.301
Hey, I'm helping you move.
I'm gonna fill out your form.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.386
I'm obviously supporting you here,

27:18.470 --> 27:22.223
but can I name 450 things
that men have done to me

27:22.307 --> 27:24.809
that are worse than balancing a checkbook?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.227
Yes, I can!

27:26.311 --> 27:31.441
Your chickenshit father, for one,
turned against me because I wanted

27:31.524 --> 27:33.485
to be more than a boring townie!

27:33.568 --> 27:37.530
-And you've had some moods, I'd say.
-I have passion.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.076
-All that man had was depression.
-Okay, Mother.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.246
Ha. Fey, it's Paula!

27:45.330 --> 27:46.331
Oh...

27:46.915 --> 27:51.252
Ask and you shall receive,
my friend, my friend!

27:52.504 --> 27:55.548
-Honey, put it right there!
-Ask and receive?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.258
-It could be the centerpiece.
-Of?

27:57.342 --> 28:00.637
My show! I've got the rest
of the stuff out in the truck.

28:00.720 --> 28:05.141
Some very heady stuff, really cerebral.

28:05.225 --> 28:09.896
Ten paintings, four sculptures,
some mixed media. Oh, shit!

28:11.147 --> 28:15.819
I said mixed media. I meant mixed metal,
but, babe, I can get you some media.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.404
-There's been some--
-Hey, Mom.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.323
You know what,
we just need to clear that wall...

28:20.407 --> 28:22.784
-Hey, Mom.
-...and face the obelisk north

28:22.867 --> 28:25.245
-because we don't want any shadows, honey.
-Mom.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.498
-Honey, can't you see I'm talking?
-Yes, I can.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.292
But he's trying to say something to you.
Something's wrong.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.378
Oh! Darling Fey, I'm so sorry.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.297
-What is it?
-Um, we've got our wires crossed.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.383
I didn't offer you a show.

28:39.384 --> 28:43.138
You said that my work
deserved a larger audience

28:43.221 --> 28:44.848
and that I should bring it in.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.224
I meant in a general sense,

28:46.307 --> 28:49.728
like I'd maybe do a show with a group
of local artists in the future.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.813
I didn't mean now.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.191
You said that you were kicking yourself

28:55.275 --> 28:58.486
for not snagging one of my bronzes
when you could have.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.072
That's just a thing people say to be nice.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.449
You know, I--

29:03.533 --> 29:06.745
I'm so sorry, Paula.
You know what a fan I am.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.539
What would this town be
without you and your pizzazz?

29:12.083 --> 29:13.084
Ah.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.130
I understand completely.

29:18.131 --> 29:21.551
Thank you for your interest in my work.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.514
I will be in the car.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.778
-Any chance I can leave this with you?
-Absolutely not.

29:51.498 --> 29:56.044
He sounded like he was really serious
about the group show with local artists.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.670
I bet you'd headline that.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.965
And we got the obelisk back, Mom.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.761
Basil's coming over.
He's bringing your paints.

30:04.844 --> 30:09.724
You can do the mural for Maddy,
with sunflowers, all those butterflies.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.685
That's gonna cheer you right up.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.364
You're an extremely rude person,
aren't you?

30:24.447 --> 30:25.990
We don't have to talk, Cilantro.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.661
Not even saying thank you to the guy
that gives you a hand.

30:29.744 --> 30:33.081
I said thank you right when you got here,
and I meant it. Thank you.

30:33.164 --> 30:36.334
-We both know you were being sarcastic.
-Okay.

30:36.417 --> 30:39.546
What did you say to your mother, anyway?
Why is she in such a state?

30:39.629 --> 30:41.297
She's upset about her art show.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.552
-Wait, she had an art show?
-She most certainly did not.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.178
I'm confused.

30:48.471 --> 30:53.184
Basil, you're just not gonna be around
long enough for me to explain this to you.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.353
Let me explain something, Alex.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.897
Your mother and I, we're in love.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.944
You're gonna be gone in three months,
and I'm gonna be like, "Bye!"

31:03.027 --> 31:05.697
That's an awful lot of meanness
coming from someone

31:05.780 --> 31:07.699
who scrubs toilets for a living.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.702
Meanness?
Is that what they say in fake Australia?

31:12.203 --> 31:17.000
-Hey, Paula! Your daughter's being rude.
-I have a genius idea!

31:17.625 --> 31:21.671
How good does a burger and a beer
sound right now, huh?

31:21.754 --> 31:22.589
Yeah.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.676
-Thanks again for all your help.
-Oh, yeah, you bet.

31:26.759 --> 31:30.346
Have a burger and a beer with us, honey.
You haven't eaten all day.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.140
I've got way too much to do.

31:32.223 --> 31:36.060
But sweetheart, I've got to fill
that form out. I can do it there!

31:37.520 --> 31:39.981
-Okay.
-Fuck the Hummingbird.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.568
Why is it even called the Hummingbird?
It's stupid.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.195
I'm not going to another one
of their openings ever again.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.114
Free cheese or not.

31:48.197 --> 31:53.494
It has taken me my entire life
to become the artist that I am.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.204
Baby, you inspire.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.623
Oh.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.124
See?

31:58.625 --> 32:02.420
Basil appreciates me. He values my time.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.089
Unlike Larry.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.842
-Who's Larry?
-I mean, what is it with this town?

32:07.926 --> 32:11.554
They just wanna keep me
imprisoned in mediocrity.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.057
Okay. Hey. Time to get out of here, guys.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.142
-Time to go.
-No, we want another round, so...

32:16.225 --> 32:18.728
No, I've got to get
to the clerk's office by 7 p.m.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.648
Fine.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.568
We'll get the check. Garçon!
Could she get the check, please?

32:26.152 --> 32:28.488
-Why would the check come to me?
-You're paying.

32:28.571 --> 32:32.533
We helped you move, the least
you can do is buy us a couple of burgers.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.744
You guys invited me,
so you were gonna pay.

32:34.827 --> 32:38.873
-Babe, we can put this on my credit card.
-No, no, no.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.877
It's the principle.
It's Happy Hour, it's not expensive.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.588
It's 36.85!

32:45.672 --> 32:47.423
You can pay for that!

32:47.507 --> 32:48.967
-Can't you?
-No, I can't.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.719
You just got a job, Alex.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.888
You just moved me into a homeless shelter.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.769
Okay, well, you just pay for the burgers,
and we'll pay for the beer!

32:59.852 --> 33:02.355
-That's fair.
-I can't pay for any of it.

33:03.022 --> 33:06.109
-I have exactly six bucks until payday.
-Six bucks.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.778
That's not enough to pay for your burger.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.408
-Unbelievable.
-It's not very considerate, Alex.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.325
No.

33:15.743 --> 33:16.577
Okay.

33:18.871 --> 33:19.914
I need the form.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.750
Oh, fuck.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.921
-When was that?
-Now, Mom. It's due right now.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.882
I'm gonna write "not applicable"
because you are not applicable.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.844
You are not my character witness.
You cannot speak on my behalf.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.388
You can't buy me a burger
on the worst week of my life.

33:35.471 --> 33:37.432
You are the shittiest mother
on the planet.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.308
I'm not the shittiest.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.520
I never lost custody of you.

33:47.859 --> 33:52.155
I know what you're thinking.
Today we'll be walking the catwalk.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.783
No, not that kind of modeling, moms.

33:55.867 --> 34:01.456
Today is about what you're teaching
your child through your own behavior,

34:01.539 --> 34:04.042
what you model to them.

34:04.125 --> 34:09.380
Now, it sounds cliché,
but your actions speak louder than words.

34:09.464 --> 34:14.510
Your children see how you handle stress,
how you treat other people.

34:14.594 --> 34:18.639
They soak all that info in
like little sponges.

34:19.515 --> 34:22.643
Children follow our example.

34:22.727 --> 34:27.982
Kids don't come out of the womb
knowing how to be violent and rude.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.735
They learn it, from you.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.361
Let's take a scenario.

34:42.705 --> 34:45.374
-What's up, Ethan?
-Hey, Sean's not with you, is he?

34:45.458 --> 34:46.542
No, he's not. Why?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.377
-Okay, cool.
-He's probably at work?

34:48.461 --> 34:51.089
Yeah, he didn't show up.
It's fine. I'm covering for him.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.966
But he'll get fired
if he doesn't show up for the night shift.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.886
-What time was he supposed to be there?
-11, to open.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.014
But he probably overslept,
let his phone die. We had a late night.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.600
Did you call his mom
and tell her to wake his ass up?

35:02.683 --> 35:04.477
I did. He's not there.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.521
Okay, bye.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.692
-Hello?
-Hey, is Maddy with you?

35:11.776 --> 35:14.278
Yes, she's right here. She's fine.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.988
We're having our snack.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.991
-Okay, where is Sean?
-Uh, work, I think.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.160
Bullshit.
Did Sean not come home last night?

35:21.244 --> 35:25.248
-That's my son's business.
-Sean staying out all night isn't unusual,

35:25.331 --> 35:28.334
but he always shows up for work
the next day, so something's wrong.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.628
When was the last time you heard from him?

35:30.711 --> 35:33.548
-Two days ago.
-Is Maddy good with you a bit longer?

35:33.631 --> 35:35.091
-Yep, she is.
-Okay.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.094
-Bye. Jasmine!
-Yeah?

35:50.982 --> 35:53.276
Okay, I'm gonna jump out here.
This is perfect.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.110
What are you doing down here
getting wrecked by yourself, Sean?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.028
I'm hiding.

36:38.654 --> 36:39.488
Go away.

36:40.114 --> 36:40.948
Can you stand?

36:41.949 --> 36:45.620
I'm fine. I'll be a mess
when the coke wears off, though.

36:46.829 --> 36:51.584
Okay, give me your keys. Give me
your keys. I'm gonna drive you home.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.672
-I'm not my mom.
-Then stop acting like your mom!

37:04.347 --> 37:07.475
You know why there's so much sea glass
on this beach?

37:10.102 --> 37:11.229
It was a dump once.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.147
Way back.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.526
Sea turns trash into treasure over time.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.449
Why don't you like me anymore?

37:25.952 --> 37:28.788
You hired a lawyer and got a judge
to take my kid away from me.

37:28.871 --> 37:32.375
No, before that.
You stopped liking me a long time ago.

37:34.961 --> 37:35.795
Why?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.632
I like you enough to pick you up
when you're drunk.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.468
Why?

37:43.761 --> 37:45.388
Because you're Maddy's dad.

37:47.181 --> 37:48.724
Is that the only reason?

38:01.821 --> 38:03.030
This used to be fun.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.033
We had fun together.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.373
We used to come down here and laugh.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.001
And fuck.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.382
Now, it's just like...

38:22.967 --> 38:26.971
-"You're a piece of shit, Sean."
-It can't be fun all the time.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.181
Maddy's a really big responsibility.

38:33.853 --> 38:34.812
I'm sea glass.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.025
I'm not trash.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.030
Just give me time.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.448
I'm not...

38:52.872 --> 38:55.082
Okay, let's get out of here. Come on.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.926
Make more treasure, waves!

39:12.391 --> 39:15.936
I'm gonna throw up for a quick sec.
I'll meet you at the car.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.333
He just needs to sleep it off.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.213
-Is Maddy asleep?
-Mm-hm.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.175
-Can I give her a kiss on the forehead?
-Yeah, go ahead.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.297
Just like his daddy.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.426
A bird that never flew.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.727
Where's your certificate of completion?
For the PEP class?

40:41.021 --> 40:43.232
-We didn't get one.
-Oh, yes, you did.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.609
Gary gives it out
at the end of the last class.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.656
I stepped out to take a phone call.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.284
Where are your character witness
statements?

40:53.367 --> 40:54.535
I tried. I couldn't get any.

40:57.329 --> 40:58.539
Is this really bad?

40:58.622 --> 41:02.168
The court likes to see
those things, so it's not great, no.

41:02.877 --> 41:07.173
But you go in and say how stable
and able you are to care for Maddy.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.844
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.222
Yeah.

41:22.146 --> 41:22.980
Hi.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.399
Hi.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.155
I just went to a meeting.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.369
Sorry about yesterday.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.080
-Thank you for...
-Sure.

41:44.210 --> 41:49.590
So I'm gonna drop the whole
ex parte, whatever, motion.

41:50.799 --> 41:51.759
Um...

41:53.135 --> 41:54.678
I don't want full custody.

41:56.138 --> 42:01.852
I mean, I do want it, but I can't
do Maddy 24/7 and stay sober.

42:04.313 --> 42:08.651
I can't have my fucking mom living
with me, triggering the shit out of me.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.949
And... Maddy misses you.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.204
She does?

42:22.873 --> 42:27.378
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy" all the time.
"Where's my mommy? Where's my mommy?"

42:27.461 --> 42:29.380
I'm like, "Fuck if I know, kid."

42:35.344 --> 42:38.180
But if we're gonna do this,
it's shared custody.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.308
-Okay, she's mine too.
-Yeah.

42:42.393 --> 42:46.397
Yeah. Okay. We can figure that out.

42:47.356 --> 42:50.985
And if you total another car with her
in it, we'll be right back here in court.

42:52.528 --> 42:57.032
Okay, yeah. Same here, if you get
drunk again while you're in charge of her.

43:00.869 --> 43:01.704
Okay, then.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.499
Okay, then.

43:11.171 --> 43:13.257
How soon do I get to have her back?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.635
And this is Mommy
and Maddy's new building.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.388
This is Mommy and Maddy's
new favorite tree.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.974
And this is Mommy and Maddy's friend Luis.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.892
You want to say hi to Luis? Hi.

43:23.976 --> 43:27.062
Your mom was here. I let her in.
Next time I won't.

43:27.896 --> 43:30.733
-Okay. Is she still in there?
-No. Came and went.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.901
Thank you. Sorry about that.

43:34.403 --> 43:37.990
And here we have Mommy
and Maddy's new stairs.

43:38.532 --> 43:41.869
And this is Mommy
and Maddy's new apartment.

43:42.828 --> 43:45.456
Mommy and Maddy's new kitchen.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.374
Maddy's new bedroom!

43:58.427 --> 43:59.511
Look what she did.

44:00.220 --> 44:03.974
How pretty is that?
Grammy came in and painted that for you.

44:05.601 --> 44:09.438
Look at the butterfly she made.
Can you kiss that monkey's hand?

44:10.606 --> 44:12.107
Oh, my, that's so good.

44:12.983 --> 44:13.817
Yeah.
