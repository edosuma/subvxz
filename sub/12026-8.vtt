Nice day, b'y, if it weren't
so (bleep) cold.

Ford, eh?
Joey: Yeah.

13:59.773 --> 14:03.474

Yeah, she's quite the rig,
Joey, b'y. Quite the Kingdom.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.243

I've never seen a ferry
like this in my life.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.344
Didn't even now they existed.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.513
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>Leaving a ferry boat</i>

39:12.851 --> 39:14.351
Todd:
It's hard to believe,
just a few weeks ago,

39:14.353 --> 39:16.786
the trucks were coming up here
and driving across this.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.589
It was all frozen, and,
I mean, driving across it

39:19.591 --> 39:22.992
to get their loads in here
delivered.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.028
(Shifts gears, truck roars)

39:28.332 --> 39:29.799
(Horn honks)

39:29.801 --> 39:35.672
<i>Todd:</i>
<i>So the only thing left to do</i>

39:35.674 --> 39:39.743
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>Todd unpacks the loader for</i>
<i>the people of the remote town,</i>

39:39.745 --> 39:43.012
<i>not letting the thaw derail</i>
<i>his mission.</i>

39:44.348 --> 39:47.150
Todd:
That's how you do that (bleep),
right there.

39:47.152 --> 39:50.954
There's only one thing left
to do, hit the road.

39:50.956 --> 39:55.024
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>With the load on the books</i>

39:58.196 --> 40:02.532
Todd:
That's just crazy.
So we're on the ferry boat.

40:02.534 --> 40:06.569
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>And heads back to Winnipeg.</i>

40:06.571 --> 40:08.304
<i>Todd:</i>
<i>What an experience, huh?</i>

40:08.306 --> 40:10.740
<i>To come up here and actually</i>
<i>do something like this,</i>

40:10.742 --> 40:13.343
and actually experience

40:13.345 --> 40:17.447
trucking across the cable ferry
boat on a river.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.682

You see where the road

40:50.315 --> 40:54.551
It's so slippery, a person
could end up in a snowbank.

It was warm all the way,

41:40.398 --> 41:42.232
we expect it to be colder up
north.

41:42.234 --> 41:43.967
I got here, it's melting,

41:43.969 --> 41:46.503
it's at least ten degrees
above freezing,

41:46.505 --> 41:48.037
and the road's closed.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.873
And not only closed,
but they blocked it,

41:49.875 --> 41:53.510
they pushed up a bunch of snow
and they blocked it with the
grader.

Well, I'm going back to where
