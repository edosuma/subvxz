00:13.014 --> 00:15.892
- [guns firing rapidly]
- [screaming]

00:17.977 --> 00:19.771
[screaming continues]

00:36.830 --> 00:38.456
[groans]

00:42.961 --> 00:44.337
[gasps]

00:48.633 --> 00:50.760
[screaming]

00:53.387 --> 00:56.474
We are ten feet from the
door. Just bust through.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.603
I can't cover you from every
angle. You're the target.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.272
- Oh, shit.
- Hold this.

01:03.356 --> 01:04.357
Claire.

01:06.109 --> 01:08.277
[mouthing]

01:13.366 --> 01:16.244
- [Shades] What's going on here?
- Cage. Behind the bar.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.873
[bullets ricocheting]

01:20.790 --> 01:22.541
He's bulletproof, ain't he?

01:22.626 --> 01:25.253
She ain't. Shoot her first.

01:25.336 --> 01:26.671
[breathing heavily]

01:41.477 --> 01:42.937
[groans]

02:09.756 --> 02:12.383
- [bullets ricocheting faintly]
- That's not gonna hold 'em long.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.929
- [banging]
- [breathing heavily]

02:16.012 --> 02:17.806
No.

02:19.683 --> 02:23.061
They barricaded the door and
shit. There's no way through.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.854
Forget Cage.

02:24.938 --> 02:26.749
The cops are gonna flood
this place in a minute.

02:26.773 --> 02:28.566
No. We're staying.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.568
Nobody leaves. Not until we have them.

02:30.652 --> 02:34.613
- What you talking about, Willis?
- You got jokes? Right now?

02:34.698 --> 02:35.865
You're the one who's joking

02:35.949 --> 02:37.968
if you think that we're
escaping here without a plan.

02:37.992 --> 02:42.038
Later for that pre-written shit.
Sometimes you gotta freestyle.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.999
Look, you got one Judas bullet left.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.251
What are you gonna do if
Luke Cage takes you head on?

02:47.335 --> 02:48.878
Do I look worried?

02:48.962 --> 02:51.005
No. That's the problem.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.468
Place is airtight.
Back is sealed off, too.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.929
[Shades] So there's no other way out?

02:58.012 --> 03:00.724
- No. Ty caught a straggler.
- [Stryker] Good.

03:00.807 --> 03:02.851
Anybody ain't us is a hostage.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.061
Make sure none of them
look me in the eye.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.396
Lopes, Sugar, you're babysitting.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.440
Move 'em up there and
face them towards the wall.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.192
Anybody resists, blindfold 'em.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.986
Too much lip, shoot 'em in the head.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.362
The rest will get the message.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.781
[men talking indistinctly]

03:16.865 --> 03:18.199
Let me go!

03:21.660 --> 03:24.914
Take Diet Obama upstairs, Ty.

03:24.998 --> 03:27.083
Keep a gun on him till I get up there.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.584
Take your hands off me!

03:29.668 --> 03:32.463
- You can't do this!
- [Stryker] Yes, we can.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.631
Zip.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.344
While you're up there, get me my key.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.827
You know the one I'm talking about.

03:46.770 --> 03:49.647
What the hell are you doing
calling me out by my first name?

03:49.731 --> 03:51.357
[Shades scoffs]

03:51.440 --> 03:53.735
You're dreaming if you think
we're getting out of here.

03:53.818 --> 03:57.030
You shot a female cop
in front of 100 people.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.614
All people will remember

03:58.697 --> 04:02.410
is Luke Cage going all King Kong with
a bitch and jumping off a balcony.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.747
What they're gonna remember is
Luke Cage running from the bullets.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.666
All they know outside is
that Cage lost his mind,

04:08.750 --> 04:10.960
shots were fired, and it's a standoff.

04:11.044 --> 04:13.046
Confusion is our friend.

04:13.129 --> 04:14.964
We kill Luke and Misty,

04:15.048 --> 04:18.426
suddenly, we're the heroes
who stopped the Harlem Menace.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.762
For all they know, he killed her.

04:20.845 --> 04:23.973
With them dead, we control the story.

04:24.057 --> 04:26.350
That's your plan? That's it?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.352
The bigger the stall,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.814
the more time we have
for other diversions.

04:30.897 --> 04:34.025
Misty will be dead, I'll
have another shot at Cage,

04:34.108 --> 04:35.795
and there's bound to be
another way out of here.

04:35.819 --> 04:37.570
We'll cross that bridge soon enough.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.615
Okay. How do we hold them off right now?

04:42.867 --> 04:45.119
I'm gonna be Luke Cage.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.331
[theme music playing]

<font color="#ffff00">encoded by</font>
<font color="##2AAE22">eMRaN92@TUT</font>

05:55.940 --> 05:58.526
- [Luke and Misty breathing heavily]
- [blood trickling]

05:58.609 --> 06:00.819
[weakly] Luke, I'm cold.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.364
- I think you nicked an artery.
- What?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.950
[Luke] That's why it's bleeding so fast.

06:06.034 --> 06:08.036
And I ain't gonna lie, Misty.

06:08.119 --> 06:10.039
- You're not gonna like this.
- What do you mean?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.665
[screams]

06:14.083 --> 06:16.169
- [groans]
- Hold that.

06:16.252 --> 06:17.628
[whimpering]

06:18.837 --> 06:20.714
We should just go out the back.

06:20.798 --> 06:24.093
- They've already secured it.
- [groans] How do you know?

06:24.177 --> 06:26.930
It's what I would do. The only
way he can win at this point

06:27.013 --> 06:28.933
is if he can control who
comes in and who leaves.

06:29.307 --> 06:31.225
Either way, I gotta
get you someplace safe.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.776
[Misty] What the hell?

06:41.069 --> 06:43.279
Lucky Luciano used to own this building.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.442
It still has a lot of
prohibition nooks and crannies.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.366
[Sugar] Sit down!

06:47.450 --> 06:49.493
Turn around. Face the wall.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.837
[Misty groans] Who's helping me?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.841
Hmm? Luke Cage? Or Carl Lucas?

07:05.426 --> 07:07.386
Who is Willis Stryker?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.138
[breathing heavily]

07:12.391 --> 07:14.060
[groans]

07:14.143 --> 07:15.894
His street name is Diamondback.

07:16.938 --> 07:19.773
He was the hardware connect for
Cottonmouth that you were looking for.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.112
- Mmm.
- He's also my half-brother. [sighs]

07:28.950 --> 07:30.451
[whistling]

07:37.000 --> 07:39.335
[Zip] Here's the key
you asked for, boss man.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.716
What're you doing?

07:47.051 --> 07:49.845
- I love this part.
- What?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.641
When the panties drop.

07:57.353 --> 07:58.396
[people screaming]

08:04.943 --> 08:06.570
[both breathing heavily]

08:06.654 --> 08:08.906
Your family is jacked up.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.075
- [sirens wailing]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

08:11.159 --> 08:12.701
[Thembi] It's chaos out here, Pat.

08:12.785 --> 08:14.453
Several people are injured,

08:14.537 --> 08:17.081
mostly from the stampede
to escape the club,

08:17.165 --> 08:18.916
but a few have gunshot wounds.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.878
Councilwoman Mariah Dillard
was whisked away by her security

08:22.961 --> 08:26.132
<i>and most of the injured protesters
have been rushed to the hospital.</i>

08:26.215 --> 08:30.053
<i>Less than an hour after an
anti-Luke Cage rally began,</i>

08:30.136 --> 08:32.638
<i>Luke Cage himself entered the event.</i>

08:32.721 --> 08:36.308
According to protesters and
a confidential NYPD source,

08:36.392 --> 08:40.895
shots rang out after veteran Harlem
police Detective Mercedes Knight

08:40.979 --> 08:42.773
<i>attempted to arrest Cage,</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:45.859
the dangerous fugitive who
attacked two police officers

08:45.943 --> 08:47.861
<i>on a widely seen dashcam video.</i>

08:47.945 --> 08:50.656
<i>And moments ago, we heard the
sound of what we believe is...</i>

08:50.739 --> 08:52.509
I wanna know if the explosion
came from the inside.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.120
Find out what you can right away.
And somebody get me Misty Knight.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.584
ESU has just arrived.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.422
- We're going tactical in five minutes.
- No, you're not.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.841
- Stand down.
- We're going in.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.926
We got an active shooter
and a hostage situation.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.197
They haven't asked for anything
and one of ours is in there.

09:13.221 --> 09:14.722
We need to be careful.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.350
This whole thing goes through me.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.186
Inspector, it's the chief.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.230
Yes, sir.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.563
[Zip] No way he went out the back.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.090
[Stryker] Scour this whole place.

09:50.508 --> 09:53.010
Every inch. Even if it's obvious.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.264
We are making way too much noise.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.807
They're gonna bust in
that door any minute.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.058
It's getting messy.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.105
- Why are you so shook?
- 'Cause I'm clearheaded.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.358
And I'm not? Look, I'm
spitting off the dome.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.693
It's true, but I haven't
had a misplaced rhyme yet.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.445
Violence breaks out

10:11.529 --> 10:14.323
at an anti-Luke Cage rally
when Luke Cage shows up?

10:14.407 --> 10:17.618
Come on, this shit is poetry.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.413
- Is he worth it?
- Absolutely.

10:21.539 --> 10:22.873
Did you talk to Mariah?

10:23.916 --> 10:26.419
- She's on it.
- Good.

10:26.502 --> 10:30.631
They're scared of Cage now.
They're afraid people will die.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.135
She'll use that to close the deal. Hmm?

10:51.026 --> 10:52.278
[Chang] We got a call.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.696
- Is it her?
- No.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.073
It's from inside. A landline.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.954
This is Inspector Priscilla
Ridley from the NYPD.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.789
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

11:03.872 --> 11:05.416
This is Damon Boone.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.753
I've been instructed to
tell you to stay away.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.922
Luke Cage has taken us hostage

11:12.005 --> 11:16.176
and he warns that he'll start
killing people if the police approach.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.430
<i>What does he want?</i>

11:19.513 --> 11:20.639
He...

11:24.227 --> 11:26.937
Unpredictability gives us leverage.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.064
[Damon] All you're
doing is scaring them.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.024
Let me help you. What do you want?

11:32.360 --> 11:33.694
Reciprocity.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.991
No one in the department is
going to bow to terrorism.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.993
Oh, I'm counting on that.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.127
Is that even clean?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.879
Clean enough for a tourniquet.

11:53.381 --> 11:54.548
Who were you, a Boy Scout?

11:55.508 --> 11:57.510
Force Recon.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.304
They had to... hear that blast outside.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.180
I should call Ridley.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.892
[groans]

12:07.811 --> 12:09.229
[softly] Oh, shit.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.274
[sighs]

12:15.193 --> 12:16.654
[cell phone vibrating]

12:20.949 --> 12:22.535
- Misty?
- [Misty distorted] <i>Inspector?</i>

12:23.452 --> 12:25.329
<i>- Inspector?</i>
- Misty.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.831
- [distorted] <i>Misty.</i>
- Inspector...

12:28.832 --> 12:30.083
[groans]

12:30.167 --> 12:31.294
Do you have your phone?

12:31.377 --> 12:34.129
- I lost mine a long time ago.
- Shit!

12:37.716 --> 12:41.595
Look, you gotta go upstairs, okay?

12:41.679 --> 12:43.347
Those people, they need you.

12:45.891 --> 12:49.019
I can't leave you. You'll bleed out.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.146
You'll die.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.777
I need to get you stabilized.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.740
Then I'll think of some way to help
Claire and everybody else up there.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.786
[breath trembling] You
can't negotiate with him.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.205
I won't.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.335
[voice breaking] I don't wanna...

13:13.961 --> 13:17.548
I don't wanna bleed to death
on the floor, like Scarfe.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.971
Not on my watch.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.227
[sniffs]

13:32.730 --> 13:36.233
I think you deserve a drink, Councilman.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.237
- I don't drink.
- Yes, you do.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.247
[smacks lips] Ah.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.877
Nothing like an aged Scotch.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.128
You know...

13:57.045 --> 13:59.548
there was a time you'd
cross a Scotsman...

14:00.591 --> 14:04.052
and he wouldn't think twice about
cutting your head off with a sword.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.056
I like a drink that encourages such...

14:08.766 --> 14:10.267
decisiveness.

14:13.396 --> 14:14.897
I can help you negotiate even more.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.357
I can speak for you.
Get you what you want.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.822
You read the Bible, Damon?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.199
Sometimes.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.993
When nothing else makes sense.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.461
I read that every day.

14:37.545 --> 14:40.088
Gift from my father to my mother.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.926
My mother left it to
me after she passed.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.262
Please.

14:48.431 --> 14:49.557
Go ahead.

15:04.447 --> 15:06.114
[Damon shuddering]

15:27.385 --> 15:29.847
[Candace inhales sharply]

15:35.060 --> 15:36.186
[softly] Hey.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.271
What's hurting?

15:40.065 --> 15:42.150
I messed up my ankle real bad.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.116
[Sugar] Hey!

15:50.451 --> 15:53.036
Sit your fine ass down.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.413
[sighs] She hurt her
leg. It could be broken.

15:55.498 --> 15:56.790
So?

15:59.167 --> 16:01.920
She's my best friend, and I'm a nurse.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.631
Don't you have enough to worry about?

16:03.714 --> 16:06.341
True. Just do it quick.

16:10.763 --> 16:12.866
- Don't help, okay? I'll do all the work.
- [exhales deeply]

16:12.890 --> 16:15.017
- [gasps]
- I'm gonna take your boot off.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.144
- [inhales sharply]
- I see.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.605
[Candace gasping]

16:19.688 --> 16:20.939
[whimpering]

16:21.774 --> 16:23.400
Move your leg like this.

16:23.484 --> 16:25.611
- Your toes?
- [groans]

16:29.615 --> 16:32.325
Yeah, I don't think it's a break.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.037
- But it's a pretty bad sprain.
- [sighs]

16:36.288 --> 16:37.498
[sighs] Were you protesting?

16:37.581 --> 16:40.375
I'm a VIP hostess. And you?

16:40.458 --> 16:43.587
Um... [sighs] I was...

16:43.671 --> 16:45.130
helping a friend.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.387
- This is some bullshit.
- You got Luke Cage?

16:52.470 --> 16:55.683
Please. That nigga's on that
bulletproof Houdini shit for real.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.976
[Sugar] What about downstairs?

16:58.060 --> 17:01.271
There's no way downstairs
from the kitchen.

17:02.773 --> 17:04.107
Is your friend Luke Cage?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.861
- Do you know him?
- Hard to forget.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.405
He used to work here.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.076
This whole thing is my fault.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.162
[stuttering] Hey... what's
happening? What's wrong?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.164
[voice breaking] I did
something really bad.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.249
Hey.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.169
What's wrong with her?

17:24.252 --> 17:26.213
[sighs] She's in a lot of pain.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.846
[whispering] Tell me.

17:33.929 --> 17:34.989
[whispering] I was so scared.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.725
They paid me to say I
saw Luke kill Cottonmouth.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.018
Who's they?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.479
Mariah Dillard.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.066
You wanna help Luke?

17:46.859 --> 17:49.402
Then you tell me how he could
have disappeared from that kitchen

17:49.486 --> 17:50.904
that no one could've escaped from.

17:52.322 --> 17:56.284
This is a prewar prohibition building.
There's a storage space underneath.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.705
Employees used to go down there to
fool around or sleep between shifts

17:59.788 --> 18:01.999
when we had to prep a big event.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.751
So it's downstairs in
the basement? Where?

18:03.834 --> 18:05.418
By the staff lockers.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.838
Would anybody else know about that?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.965
Not unless they worked in the kitchen.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.134
I'm the only person from
the waitstaff here...

18:12.217 --> 18:13.969
- except Luke.
- [sighs]

18:14.762 --> 18:16.722
The only way in or out
of that storage room

18:16.805 --> 18:18.181
is through the kitchen.

18:19.182 --> 18:23.020
Luke can make another door. Okay,
I'm gonna need you to pass out.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.397
- What?
- I need you to pass out.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.940
I'm gonna get us out of this.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.652
- [sighs]
- [Claire] Oh... Oh, my God!

18:29.735 --> 18:31.403
- Help us!
- [Sugar] What now?

18:31.486 --> 18:33.822
- [Claire] She's diabetic.
- Where's her shit?

18:33.906 --> 18:36.992
[stutters] Uh, it must be in,
uh, the staff locker downstairs.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.537
Yo, Lopes. Escort the
night nurse here downstairs.

18:40.621 --> 18:41.830
Thank you.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.041
Will you look after her?

18:44.124 --> 18:45.793
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Uh-huh.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.711
Okay, baby.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.424
Come on. Come on, now.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.302
- Just down here. [grunts]
- Just hurry up.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.220
[Lopes groaning]

19:10.358 --> 19:11.777
You'll live.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.537
Hey.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.961
[sighs]

19:29.044 --> 19:32.715
So, what does this brother
of yours want, anyway?

19:32.798 --> 19:34.049
Revenge.

19:34.717 --> 19:37.845
He framed me. He sent me to Seagate.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.891
He's trying to pin this
whole hostage thing on you.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.770
Did he set you up for
Cottonmouth's murder, too?

19:46.854 --> 19:48.772
I wouldn't put it past him.

19:49.732 --> 19:51.649
You're the only one
that knows the truth.

19:51.734 --> 19:54.611
I'll need your help
when we get out of this.

19:54.695 --> 19:55.946
You'll have it.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.742
[indistinct chatter]

20:09.251 --> 20:11.086
[siren wailing]

20:14.006 --> 20:16.466
- We need to go in.
- Not until we have a plan.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.094
Cage is super strong and bulletproof.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.847
The longer we sit, the more
entrenched this lunatic gets.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.932
We've had exactly one
conversation with a hostage,

20:24.016 --> 20:26.601
Damon Boone, the politician,
and we got cut off.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.938
Now, I am with you on going
in, but we need a plan.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.982
We've never faced
anything like this before.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.864
Inspector Ridley? Blake
Tower, DA's Office.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.616
- Mr. Tower. What's going on?
- You tell me.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.077
We've been closely
following Cage's activities.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.596
The mayor would like
me to help coordinate.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.581
- The situation is coordinated.
- Really?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.212
- We're on the same side...
- Hmm.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.416
And I'd like to guide you

20:55.463 --> 20:57.734
as how best to achieve an outcome
that's beneficial to all parties.

20:57.758 --> 20:58.985
Yeah, the most beneficial outcome

20:59.009 --> 21:01.929
is for me to get those hostages
and my detective out alive,

21:02.012 --> 21:03.680
and Luke Cage in cuffs.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.933
None of which you can give me.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.059
- Inspector?
- Yeah.

21:07.142 --> 21:10.520
We have independent confirmation
that the explosion came from inside.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.773
- Now can we go in?
- We wait.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.192
What if he just shoots
all those people dead?

21:15.275 --> 21:16.401
That is not Cage's MO.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.696
Every encounter we've ever had
with him, he's never used a gun.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.031
He doesn't have to.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.576
- Well, he's using one now, isn't he?
- Well, I saw that dashcam video.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.263
He can take out your whole team in
mere seconds and not get a scratch.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.538
I agree.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.624
In order to engage this asshole,
we need to bring the heat.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.669
You got any ideas Mr., uh, ADA?

21:35.587 --> 21:37.464
Look, the mayor is in
a closed-door session

21:37.547 --> 21:39.925
discussing enhanced
weapons for law enforcement.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.176
With who?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.012
Mariah Dillard.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.641
[Misty] What's wrong?

21:49.601 --> 21:50.685
It needs to be tighter.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.106
Brace yourself.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.985
- One...
- [yells]

21:58.068 --> 22:00.778
[groaning]

22:00.863 --> 22:02.614
[Luke breathing heavily]

22:04.782 --> 22:08.120
I feel like getting my
Crispus Attucks on up there.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.622
Mmm, you gotta be smart about this.

22:11.248 --> 22:14.167
There are too many innocent people
up there who could end up dead.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.420
I might not have a choice.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.175
I had a choice.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.928
I should have trusted you.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.015
I know.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.349
[chuckles]

22:30.517 --> 22:32.560
[scoffs] You didn't make it easy.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.237
Don't go doing anything stupid.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.365
Like what?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.492
Be a hero.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.745
I'm not the hero type.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.789
Are you sure?

22:54.832 --> 22:57.335
Looks to me like that's
what you've always been.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.095
[faint tapping]

23:07.179 --> 23:08.596
You hear that?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.557
[tapping continues]

23:17.230 --> 23:18.648
[tapping continues]

23:48.386 --> 23:49.946
Why the hell didn't you leave the club?

23:49.972 --> 23:52.265
When have I ever done as I was told?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.982
[Luke] Misty! Misty!

24:01.733 --> 24:04.027
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.863
What's going on?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.823
We might have something
to take Luke Cage out.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.534
An experimental weapon that's
never been authorized before.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.744
[Tower] Hmm.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.663
- Someone's pulling strings. Is that you?
- No.

24:15.747 --> 24:19.292
Then it's Mariah Dillard. Did
you put her in touch with someone?

24:20.252 --> 24:22.087
It's Boone again.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.886
Mr. Boone. Are you okay?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.971
Luke Cage would like
to give you his demands.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.390
<i>We're listening.</i>

24:33.473 --> 24:35.308
He wants a chopper on the roof.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.995
As a sign of goodwill,
Mr. Cage is willing

24:37.019 --> 24:39.146
<i>to let half the hostages
go at the end of this call.</i>

24:40.438 --> 24:44.276
Me and a few others will
remain to ensure his escape.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.985
We will get right on that.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.239
Is Detective Knight still alive?

24:51.824 --> 24:54.202
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

24:55.203 --> 24:56.963
We will need proof of
life before we proceed.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.040
[mouthing] No.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.084
He's saying you're not in
a position to make demands.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.295
<i>Well, then we have a problem.</i>

25:03.378 --> 25:06.923
He says a few hostages
will be coming out now.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.402
- [woman] Got it!
- He's stalling.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.237
I know what he's doing. He
could just want a way out.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.447
We should keep on stalling him
until the new weapons show up.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.183
I take my orders from the chief.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.850
What's really going on here?

25:19.269 --> 25:20.478
Do I want us to use a weapon

25:20.562 --> 25:22.689
that can take out a
man that's bulletproof?

25:22.772 --> 25:24.899
- Absolutely not.
- I don't understand.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.569
Look, any weapon that
the police or military has

25:27.652 --> 25:29.321
eventually ends up on the street.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.990
You know it's dangerous to
even show that kind of power.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.327
Hey, but I don't see
we got much of a choice.

25:36.536 --> 25:40.039
- I don't trust Mariah Dillard.
- Yeah, I don't either.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.418
But she has juice with
people way above our paygrade.

25:43.501 --> 25:46.181
I just don't want this to turn into
the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

25:46.213 --> 25:50.383
Frank Castle shot the city to hell,
and he only had regular bullets.

25:50.467 --> 25:53.067
Now imagine what he or somebody
like him can do with these things.

25:53.136 --> 25:56.098
Yeah, I hear you. Who is the
one person you don't see here?

25:56.181 --> 25:58.100
Hmm. A chief.

25:58.183 --> 26:01.436
And what does that tell you?
He wants distance. Deniability.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.896
If this goes wrong, the
blood is on my hands,

26:03.980 --> 26:05.523
- and mine alone.
- [Chang] Inspector.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.525
There's movement at the door.

26:11.779 --> 26:14.491
- [officer 1] Eyes up. He's comingout.
- [officer 2] Hold fire.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.496
- [officer 3] Hands! Hands!
- [officer 4] Put your hands in the air!

26:20.872 --> 26:22.290
Step forward.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.421
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

26:28.505 --> 26:31.508
- Move it, come on!
- That's right. This way! Go, go!

26:31.591 --> 26:32.592
We're clear.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.435
- Get them out of here. Come on.
- Follow me.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.609
Well, it went clean through.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.657
- You've lost a lot of blood.
- Mmm.

26:55.740 --> 26:59.161
I handled the situation the best I
could under the circumstances, Claire.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.621
[Claire] Yeah, you're lucky
she didn't lose her arm.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.040
That is way too close to the wound.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.335
Me, medical shit. You, bulletproof shit.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.379
Y'all sound married.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.301
- [Claire sighs]
- That's good.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.595
I'm gonna get some stuff.

27:22.934 --> 27:26.396
[Stryker] Oh, my mama
loved blue-eyed soul.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.066
["Son of a Preacher Man" playing]

27:33.445 --> 27:36.448
I wish you could have met Dana...

27:38.700 --> 27:39.867
my mother.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.210
- She's beautiful.
- Yes.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.505
She was a secretary
for a big-time preacher.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.717
A bold, charismatic man who...

27:55.800 --> 27:58.678
loved to talk loud and dress fancy.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.306
- Like you.
- Exactly.

28:01.389 --> 28:04.851
They worked long, stressful hours and...

28:05.768 --> 28:08.896
Well, they had a lot of
laughter in that back office.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.400
Something was bound to happen and...

28:13.235 --> 28:14.361
it did.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.863
I was born.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.199
But he was married.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.872
And everything was good...

28:27.540 --> 28:31.544
until the preacher's wife, two
years later, had a baby boy.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.087
A miracle child.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.508
And everything changed.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.844
The great Reverend Lucas

28:39.927 --> 28:43.306
wasn't man enough to give
his first son his last name.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.850
You see, I was still Willis Stryker.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.435
But his real son...

28:48.520 --> 28:50.104
was Carl Lucas.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.317
But... here's the crazy thing.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.069
Nobody said nothing.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.447
And Carl and I...

29:00.114 --> 29:03.159
we grew up best friends, but...

29:03.243 --> 29:05.077
there was all this tension.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.455
You could just feel it

29:07.539 --> 29:10.708
like a draft coming
in from under a door.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.880
I just wanted him to see me.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.342
I was a good boy.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.095
I did well in school.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.601
But he always loved Carl more.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.234

- [sirens wailing]

29:38.486 --> 29:41.072
Inspector? A word?

29:41.155 --> 29:42.490
I'll be right back.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.996
Some of the hostages'
statements are not matching up.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.624
Most are saying that they saw
people inside shooting at Cage,

29:51.708 --> 29:53.293
not the other way around.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.253
We might have this all wrong.

29:57.547 --> 29:58.756
We might.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.943
We'll have time to get to the
bottom of what's going on later.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.111
But right now, we need to
get control of this situation,

30:03.135 --> 30:05.305
and we are not in control yet.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.312
[man whimpering]

30:13.229 --> 30:14.981
You! Stop looking around!

30:22.113 --> 30:25.241
- The first of the hostages are gone.
- Good.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.135
You're not worried about
what they're gonna say?

30:27.159 --> 30:30.997
By the time anyone figures out the
truth, Harlem's Menace will be dead

30:31.080 --> 30:32.582
or I will.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.084
I ain't testifying. Are you?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.044
[scoffs] Why would I?

30:38.087 --> 30:40.715
Would you really want me to
confirm that you had no plan?

30:41.633 --> 30:44.427
Think about how stupid that
would make both of us look.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.347
Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

30:47.430 --> 30:48.723
Have you?

30:52.226 --> 30:54.521
- What about the helicopter?
- Please.

30:54.604 --> 30:56.689
There's no way they'll agree to that.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.232
- I know.
- Hmm.

30:59.526 --> 31:01.027
[Stryker] What happened?

31:01.110 --> 31:03.530
- Lopes got pushed down the stairs.
- What?

31:03.613 --> 31:05.573
One of the hostages passed out,

31:05.657 --> 31:07.700
and another one went to
go get her medication.

31:07.784 --> 31:11.162
- Which hostage?
- The waitress from VIP.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.205
The West Indian-lookin' chick.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.463
Candace. God...

31:21.338 --> 31:24.050
- Did you find the other one?
- No.

31:26.302 --> 31:29.346
Diamondback and I aren't
finished speaking, Sugar.

31:29.431 --> 31:31.558
So I'm gonna need y'all to fall back.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.892
My bad.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.772
[Shades sighs]

31:37.855 --> 31:38.940
What?

31:39.774 --> 31:44.862
Candace is the one that Mariah used to
pin Cottonmouth's murder on Luke Cage.

31:44.946 --> 31:45.988
The other one...

31:46.072 --> 31:48.032
Is probably the one who
stabbed me at the clinic.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.201
Damn it. I knew she looked familiar.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.994
She probably came in with Cage.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.871
- Candace knows what Cage looks like.
- Hmm.

31:53.955 --> 31:57.584
The other chick with
him, if she escapes...

31:57.667 --> 32:00.044
Either one of them could
blow our cover story.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.298
- They all got to go.
- Take care of it then.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.761
You and me, we get out of this...

32:09.721 --> 32:12.474
we're gonna have a long talk.

32:12.557 --> 32:14.266
Best believe that.

32:15.768 --> 32:16.769
Hmm.

32:18.855 --> 32:20.482
[Shades] Let's go. Downstairs.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.534
Carl, Carl, Carl.

32:31.618 --> 32:33.620
[over PA] <i>Here you go again.</i>

32:33.703 --> 32:37.206
<i>Bobbing and weaving because
you're too scared to take a hit.</i>

32:37.289 --> 32:39.584
It's just like I taught you in the ring.

32:41.252 --> 32:43.129
No matter how much you duck,

32:43.212 --> 32:46.173
eventually, you're gonna
have to knuck and buck.

32:47.884 --> 32:50.011
<i>If you don't surrender yourself...</i>

32:51.262 --> 32:53.389
and Misty Knight...

32:54.474 --> 32:57.977
I'm gonna kill a hostage
every ten minutes...

32:59.020 --> 33:01.689
- starting with Damon Boone.
- [gasps]

33:03.315 --> 33:05.026
He's not bluffing.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.531
- I gotta take him out.
- You're walking into a trap.

33:09.614 --> 33:11.824
- You know that.
- I'm counting on it.

33:11.908 --> 33:15.202
You don't always have to fight to win.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.997
Look, if things go south,
we are surrounded by cops.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.500
I'll make sure that they
know you're innocent.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.669
They'll know the truth, I promise.

33:22.752 --> 33:25.337
Don't go dying on me, Misty.

33:25.421 --> 33:28.591
- Not on my watch.
- Hmm. That's usually his line.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.676
[sighs]

33:29.759 --> 33:31.928
They used that waitress,
Candace, to frame you.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.305
[Misty scoffs] Lyin' ass.

33:34.388 --> 33:35.682
Where is she?

33:35.765 --> 33:37.850
[Claire] Upstairs with the others.

33:39.435 --> 33:40.562
Hey.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.606
What if he has more of
those special bullets?

33:45.066 --> 33:46.426
That's a chance I'll have to take.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.737
If I don't walk away from
this, you need to lay in the cut

33:49.821 --> 33:52.114
until you hear from
me, Bobby Fish or Misty.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.033
No one else.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.536
- You know how well I follow orders.
- I'm serious.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.539
Willis plays for keeps...

34:00.748 --> 34:02.875
especially with people
I care about the most.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.838
Promise me.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.050
I will.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.636
- You have a place in mind?
- Yeah.

34:14.721 --> 34:15.847
Be careful.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.183
Always.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.018
You're so corny.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.320
[inhales sharply]

34:31.402 --> 34:32.739
[groaning]

34:36.868 --> 34:40.871
Keep that right there,
okay? Arm turned up.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.625
- Shit! [groans]
- Shh!

34:44.751 --> 34:45.752
You could've warned me.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.379
Yeah, I could've.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.051
Talk me through what you're about to do.

34:54.969 --> 34:59.473
Okay. I am gonna use
this dental floss...

34:59.556 --> 35:00.892
to tie off your...

35:01.893 --> 35:04.896
- hosing vein.
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.564
[inhales sharply]

35:07.649 --> 35:09.441
- [groans]
- [Claire softly] There.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.404
This is gonna cut the blood supply
to your hand and your forearm.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.364
[Misty breathing heavily]

35:15.907 --> 35:16.987
The longer this stays in...

35:18.159 --> 35:20.369
the higher the chances
of losing your arm.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.081
Look, I want to apologize.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.583
I shouldn't have lost my cool with you.

35:26.668 --> 35:29.671
Ah, you can't be to blame
with this kind of crazy.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.506
Well, you're in pretty deep.

35:32.589 --> 35:35.635
Yeah, well, trouble stalks
me like a crazy ex-boyfriend.

35:35.718 --> 35:37.219
[chuckles]

35:37.845 --> 35:39.263
I hear you.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.767
You and Luke go out for coffee yet?

35:44.268 --> 35:46.520
Uh, we haven't had time.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.231
He doesn't like coffee.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.984
I know.

35:53.569 --> 35:56.530
[inhales deeply] All done.

35:57.782 --> 35:59.491
Damn, you're good.

36:00.534 --> 36:03.454
You're good at your
job, I'm good at mine.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.751
[man] <i>Mariah talked to the
mayor. The guns are a go.</i>

36:08.835 --> 36:09.919
<i>Good luck, brother.</i>

36:13.130 --> 36:16.550
Councilwoman Dillard
never ceases to amaze me.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.011
Pressure...

36:19.679 --> 36:22.431
brings the best out of certain people.

36:23.850 --> 36:26.018
So... where was I?

36:26.102 --> 36:27.186
Together...

36:28.104 --> 36:29.563
we were bold.

36:30.690 --> 36:33.901
We stole a red Corvette,
just like the song...

36:33.985 --> 36:37.321
just... for a joyride.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.906
You see, I was a Prince fan, and...

36:39.824 --> 36:41.993
Carl was all about Michael.

36:42.076 --> 36:46.205
We were so busy arguing,
we didn't even see the cop.

36:46.288 --> 36:48.791
But Carl was a Lucas.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.878
I was a Stryker.

36:53.921 --> 36:56.758
It was over before it even began.

36:57.884 --> 36:59.844
[over PA] When it came
time for sentencing,

36:59.927 --> 37:04.390
the preacher convinced the judge to
let his golden boy join the Marines.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.725
Me?

37:07.226 --> 37:08.269
Juvie.

37:09.771 --> 37:12.064
Got jumped two days in.

37:13.733 --> 37:15.902
Boy drew a shank and...

37:17.153 --> 37:18.195
[grunting]

37:18.946 --> 37:20.948
I killed him in self-defense.

37:21.032 --> 37:22.742
[grunting continues]

37:24.660 --> 37:27.038
So I got sent away to hard time.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.875
<i>And sweet Dana?</i>

37:34.586 --> 37:38.174
Oh, her cancer ate her
alive and she died alone...

37:40.384 --> 37:41.928
<i>in a shelter...</i>

37:43.429 --> 37:45.890
<i>without a friend in the world.</i>

37:46.891 --> 37:49.101
You see, the good Reverend Lucas...

37:50.519 --> 37:53.355
well, he stopped caring
for her after I was gone.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.482
<i>He was free of her...</i>

37:57.234 --> 37:59.278
<i>and I was powerless.</i>

38:01.113 --> 38:02.824
But she, oh...

38:02.907 --> 38:05.367
Oh, she still loved him...

38:06.702 --> 38:10.747
and... well, she wanted me to
have something of my father's.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.627
<i>God had me at hello with Genesis.</i>

38:15.711 --> 38:17.754
<i>The story of Cain and Abel.</i>

38:19.048 --> 38:24.345
When God asked Cain where
Abel was after he killed him...

38:24.428 --> 38:28.182
Cain asked, "Am I my brother's keeper?"

38:28.265 --> 38:29.934
See...

38:30.017 --> 38:34.981
<i>I thought that was some cool shit</i>
<i>Wesley Snipes made up in</i> New Jack City.

38:35.064 --> 38:36.273
[grunts]

38:41.237 --> 38:42.738
Turns out...

38:44.615 --> 38:45.908
it's real.

38:47.243 --> 38:48.244
So...

38:49.703 --> 38:51.788
after I kill Luke Cage...

38:53.249 --> 38:58.295
I'm gonna stand over
him and say, "Yes, I am."

39:12.059 --> 39:14.896
- Why are you telling me all this?
- [glove powering up]

39:21.360 --> 39:22.694
[grunts]

39:25.531 --> 39:28.159
Because you're about to
meet my mother, Damon.

39:29.076 --> 39:31.078
Tell her I love her.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.246
- [grunts]
- [screams]

39:32.788 --> 39:34.165
[glass shattering]

39:41.297 --> 39:45.009
[Stryker] Shades, show
Councilman Boone to the door.

39:45.092 --> 39:46.510
[yells]

39:49.805 --> 39:51.307
[indistinct chatter]

39:52.016 --> 39:53.434
- Door!
- [officer 1] Opening door!

39:55.311 --> 39:57.771
[officer 2] Put your hands in the air!

40:02.609 --> 40:05.446
Go, go, go. Let's go.
Let's spread in. Move in.

40:05.529 --> 40:07.089
Let's go, guys. Get him up. Get him up.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.701
Someone grab his feet.

40:12.286 --> 40:14.330
[indistinct chatter]

40:20.169 --> 40:21.420
He's dead.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.381
Chest is caved in.

40:25.925 --> 40:28.010
Move in now.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.222
<i>It has been confirmed</i>

40:31.305 --> 40:35.684
<i>that the body thrown from the entrance
was indeed Harlem's own, Damon Boone.</i>

40:35.767 --> 40:40.189
<i>At this time, we still have no
clear idea what Luke Cage wants.</i>

40:52.952 --> 40:54.245
[floor creaks]

40:58.874 --> 41:00.626
[creaking continues]

41:43.877 --> 41:45.797
- [woman] What's going on?
- [Sugar] Turn around.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.602
I see Luke Cage was here.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.024
[Misty screams]

42:05.107 --> 42:06.483
[Claire grunts]

42:07.443 --> 42:09.028
[both grunting]

42:20.206 --> 42:21.748
[shouts]

42:32.968 --> 42:34.761
[both panting]

42:38.807 --> 42:40.702
- [Claire] Let me help you.
- [handcuffs clicking]

42:40.726 --> 42:42.144
[Misty] Okay.

42:42.228 --> 42:43.604
[Misty groaning]

42:51.862 --> 42:53.280
[Misty groans]

42:53.364 --> 42:55.282
You got skills.

42:55.366 --> 42:58.327
[panting] Likewise.

42:59.328 --> 43:00.787
My father.

43:02.498 --> 43:03.874
My uncle.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.543
[both chuckling]

43:07.878 --> 43:09.796
[indistinct radio chatter]

43:10.756 --> 43:12.516
[officer 1] All right.
Still waiting on word.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.056
I hope they know what
they're authorizing.

43:20.141 --> 43:21.868
Our main focus should
be freeing the hostages.

43:21.892 --> 43:23.852
They shouldn't shoot
unless absolutely necessary.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.980
My men know the job. Stop
meddling and let us get to work.

43:27.063 --> 43:28.149
Hey...

43:29.150 --> 43:32.319
Luke Cage might not be behind this.

43:33.154 --> 43:34.905
I'll ask him when I see him.

43:50.629 --> 43:52.423
[Sugar] Nobody move.

43:52.506 --> 43:54.090
I ain't playing.

43:59.305 --> 44:00.306
[grunts]

44:02.849 --> 44:04.810
[whispers] This way.

44:04.893 --> 44:05.894
[indistinct chatter]

44:07.103 --> 44:09.523
Wave this. Keep your hands raised.

44:12.067 --> 44:13.652
[Stryker] Hey, Carl.

44:17.823 --> 44:20.284
What's happening, brother?

44:20.367 --> 44:23.787
We have what looks like
more hostages being released.

44:23.870 --> 44:26.207
And ESU Officers are
approaching the building entrance

44:26.290 --> 44:29.042
to allegedly confront Luke Cage.

44:31.044 --> 44:33.714
- Let her go.
- Oh, we'll get to that.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.344
Couldn't we have made
amends a long time ago?

44:38.427 --> 44:40.429
Couldn't you have
died during childbirth?

44:41.597 --> 44:43.765
Easy there.

44:43.849 --> 44:45.226
[Candace whimpering]

44:45.309 --> 44:46.310
[gasps]

44:53.400 --> 44:55.319
I was sorry to hear about Dana.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.864
I always liked her.

44:59.865 --> 45:03.076
I couldn't stand Etta. What a bitch!

45:11.710 --> 45:14.255
- [Banging on door]
- [officer 1] We have lethal rounds, Cage

45:14.338 --> 45:16.840
- We will use them.
- [Stryker] Gotta go.

45:16.923 --> 45:18.300
With that hostage you killed,

45:18.384 --> 45:20.802
they're gonna shoot first
and ask questions later.

45:20.886 --> 45:24.598
Mariah supplied the force
with some Judas 2.0s,

45:24.681 --> 45:26.725
so they won't bounce off of you.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.894
- They'll stick.
- [Candace whimpers]

45:29.895 --> 45:31.438
You gonna run, Miracle Whip?

45:32.314 --> 45:34.358
Or you gonna save the damsel?

45:34.441 --> 45:35.817
Willis.

45:35.901 --> 45:37.444
Bye, Carl.

45:37.528 --> 45:38.737
Bye, Felicia.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.155
[Candace screaming]

45:50.916 --> 45:52.836
- [officer 1] Go, go!
- [officer 2] Get in there!

45:55.296 --> 45:56.838
- [banging]
- [indistinct chatter]

46:00.133 --> 46:01.718
I'm sorry, Luke.

46:02.719 --> 46:04.759
- [officer 1] Move in!
- [officer 2] We have visual.

46:07.891 --> 46:09.685
[officer 1] Hands in the air!

46:09.768 --> 46:11.520
[officer 2] You heard him. Don't move.

46:14.523 --> 46:16.024
[officer 1] In the air!

46:21.530 --> 46:24.032
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What are you doing?

46:24.115 --> 46:26.117
- You want to get out of here, right?
- Yeah.

46:26.201 --> 46:29.204
Okay. This way. This way.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.878
[officer] I said in the air, now!

46:38.004 --> 46:39.548
[indistinct radio chatter]

46:46.137 --> 46:49.265
- Hey, you got a ride?
- Cottonmouth had three.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.979
[indistinct chatter]

46:57.315 --> 46:58.984
[Ridley] It worked.

46:59.067 --> 47:00.902
They got him. Didn't even have to fire.

47:00.986 --> 47:03.321
That's all that matters. Those
weapons are a game changer.

47:03.405 --> 47:05.866
- Hope we never have to use them.
- [Misty] Inspector.

47:08.619 --> 47:09.786
[Ridley] Are you okay?

47:09.870 --> 47:11.955
Listen, Luke Cage is innocent.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.750
What you think you saw
is not what happened.

47:14.833 --> 47:17.711
Why don't you focus on getting
fixed up? Let us clean up this mess.

47:17.794 --> 47:22.257
This mess is Willis Stryker's
doing. He's the one who shot me.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.760
Listen, his name is Diamondback.

47:24.843 --> 47:26.177
I believe you, Misty.

47:26.261 --> 47:27.655
There are dozens of
other people to talk to.

47:27.679 --> 47:30.641
And Luke is still wanted for
Albini's murder, Cottonmouth's murder,

47:30.724 --> 47:33.309
- and attacking those cops.
- You are not listening to me.

47:34.645 --> 47:38.106
Luke Cage is innocent of everything.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.401
And after we have him in
custody, we'll verify it.

47:40.484 --> 47:42.694
Look... I trust you.

47:42.778 --> 47:44.154
I do.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.990
But we have to verify.

47:48.700 --> 47:52.328
The only thing that
matters is the truth.

47:57.250 --> 47:59.711
We got you, Detective.
Let me look at your arm.

48:00.712 --> 48:03.549
Listen, whatever you need to
do, you need to do it right here.

48:03.632 --> 48:07.010
Okay? I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.

48:10.096 --> 48:11.973
[siren wails]

48:16.687 --> 48:17.729
[softly] Let's go.

48:43.714 --> 48:46.091
[man] Yo! That's Luke Cage!

48:46.174 --> 48:48.218
- Check him out, man!
- [woman] That's him!

48:48.301 --> 48:50.303
Yo, B! There go Luke!

48:52.138 --> 48:54.349
[man] We know you innocent, Luke!

49:06.903 --> 49:08.446
[mouthing] Go.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.801
