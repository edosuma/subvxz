01:23.140 --> 01:25.043
Here, get some dirt
on that shovel.

02:01.711 --> 02:04.078
This wasn't how it was supposed to go down.
This wasn't the plan.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.447
We did our part!

02:05.449 --> 02:07.149
You both gotta calm down.

02:07.151 --> 02:09.049
Nobody got hurt!
That was the agreement!

02:09.050 --> 02:11.753
No, you changed the plan on him!

02:11.755 --> 02:13.855
Nobody got hurt!
That was the deal!

02:13.857 --> 02:15.991
I don't wanna spend the rest of
my life looking over my shoulder!

02:15.993 --> 02:19.097
This was the only way we were gonna
get back what they stole from us!

02:19.797 --> 02:22.100
Now speed it up or we're
not gonna make our window!

02:36.847 --> 02:37.882
Who are those guys?

02:38.848 --> 02:40.650
I don't know.
That's not them, though.

02:56.866 --> 02:57.768
I don't like this.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.837
Play it cool. I'll handle this.

03:06.043 --> 03:07.578
Keep your eyes
on the woods, boys.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.047
Mac, stay back till we call you.

03:31.801 --> 03:32.934
Who the hell are you?

03:32.936 --> 03:33.837
Never mind that.

03:34.137 --> 03:35.205
Where's the money?

03:37.206 --> 03:38.442
Here you go.

03:42.779 --> 03:43.881
Where's the rest of it?

03:44.180 --> 03:45.949
We took our share.
That's your cut.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.850
Truby, Foster, let's go.

03:48.852 --> 03:49.784
That wasn't the deal.

03:49.786 --> 03:50.755
Not now, Mac.

03:51.154 --> 03:52.156
Yeah, well, it is now.

03:53.055 --> 03:54.658
- That's gotta be less than half.
- Come on.

03:55.793 --> 03:57.259
- You're damn right it's less than half.
- Let's go.

03:57.261 --> 03:58.529
Twenty million split four ways.

03:59.295 --> 04:02.230
Three of us pulled the job. Five
million apiece. The rest is yours.

04:02.232 --> 04:05.203
Any one of those bills could've been
marked. How do you expect to launder it?

04:05.769 --> 04:06.971
Let us worry about it.

04:07.770 --> 04:09.537
Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax.

04:09.539 --> 04:10.971
Where's our money, asshole?

04:10.973 --> 04:12.042
Easy, guys.

04:12.842 --> 04:14.744
- Where's the money?
- Calm down, all right?

04:15.012 --> 04:17.177
We buried the money. You kill
us, nobody gets anything.

04:17.178 --> 04:18.846
- Just calm down, everybody.
- He's bluffing.

04:18.849 --> 04:20.314
Just relax.
This isn't the plan.

04:20.315 --> 04:21.952
You're right.
It isn't part of the plan.

04:22.251 --> 04:24.319
- Truby, Foster, get in the goddamn truck!
- Look. Mac, relax.

04:24.321 --> 04:26.888
- Everybody relax. Put the guns away.
- Put the guns away.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.590
- Everybody just relax!
- We want the money!

04:28.592 --> 04:29.861
Where's our money?

04:30.693 --> 04:31.729
Calm down!

04:32.162 --> 04:33.498
Money!

04:49.979 --> 04:50.881
Shit.

05:13.270 --> 05:14.639
Move, move, move, move!

05:35.092 --> 05:36.794
Check the truck! Go, go, go!

06:13.429 --> 06:14.331
Fuck.

06:16.366 --> 06:17.902
Son of a bitch!

06:57.941 --> 07:00.744
Come on! Get out of there!
We gotta get out of here!

07:15.292 --> 07:16.426
Let's get out of here.

08:55.425 --> 08:57.825
How far are we
from the primary crime scene?

08:57.827 --> 08:59.993
They're walking it now, but it looks
like it's less than two miles

08:59.995 --> 09:01.161
if he cut his way
through the marsh.

09:01.163 --> 09:02.198
Can we get a flyover?

09:02.865 --> 09:04.033
Not before the weather.

09:05.268 --> 09:06.336
Sykes.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.012
What time did the call come in?

09:16.012 --> 09:17.882
Approximately 9:30
this morning.

09:20.149 --> 09:22.318
I don't see any brass.
Any exchange of fire?

09:22.518 --> 09:24.020
Well, apparently this one here,

09:25.555 --> 09:27.588
two others that were discovered by a
couple of hunters over on Route 20.

09:27.590 --> 09:29.859
Got themselves
into one hell of a firefight.

09:30.226 --> 09:32.459
We recovered over two dozen
spent shell casings.

09:32.461 --> 09:34.564
The first responding officers
tracked him here.

09:35.465 --> 09:36.966
Got IDs?

09:37.200 --> 09:39.367
So far, we know this one
to be Donovan MacDonald.

09:39.369 --> 09:43.072
The other two are Ike Foster
and John Truby.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.408
John Truby.

09:46.575 --> 09:49.376
Mr. Truby had a security badge
from Central City Bank.

09:49.378 --> 09:50.346
Hmm.

09:52.449 --> 09:54.984
The bank that got robbed
downtown yesterday.

09:59.422 --> 10:01.955
So what's our chances of getting
anything out of this guy here?

10:01.957 --> 10:03.293
Spotty at best.

10:04.527 --> 10:06.162
- The paramedics gave him 50/50 when they got here.
- Hmm.

10:08.098 --> 10:10.430
Hey, I need you guys to get him down
to the trauma center, all right?

10:10.432 --> 10:15.004
- Yes, sir.
- And no one talks to this guy, except with me.

10:17.941 --> 10:18.942
All right.

10:21.010 --> 10:22.345
That's it. Have a nice trip.

10:53.976 --> 10:57.444
<i>Law enforcement officials are following
several leads in what authorities are calling</i>

10:57.446 --> 10:59.482
<i>one of the largest bank
robberies in state history.</i>

11:01.084 --> 11:03.550
<i>Over 20 million was stolen
from Central City Bank</i>

11:03.552 --> 11:05.522
<i>in the morning hours
of Monday, April 8th.</i>

11:07.123 --> 11:09.994
<i>Ike Foster and John Truby
died at the scene.</i>

11:10.726 --> 11:13.593
<i>The third subject, Donovan
MacDonald, remains in a coma,</i>

11:13.595 --> 11:16.133
<i>following injuries
sustained during the robbery.</i>

11:18.534 --> 11:20.668
<i>At the press conference
earlier today,</i>

11:20.670 --> 11:23.271
<i>Captain Stover of Metropolitan
Police Department</i>

11:23.273 --> 11:26.573
<i>released updated information
regarding the alleged suspects.</i>

11:26.575 --> 11:29.946
<i>Our Major Crimes Unit
is investigating multiple lead.</i>

11:30.479 --> 11:34.582
<i>Our preliminary results indicated
that one of the suspects, John Trub,</i>

11:34.584 --> 11:36.450
<i>was employed by
the security firm</i>

11:36.452 --> 11:39.355
<i>that was contracted
at Central City Bank.</i>

11:42.325 --> 11:45.461
<i>We're still reviewing those findings
with our partners in the FBI.</i>

11:46.162 --> 11:49.497
<i>We don't wanna jump the gun till
we have more definite details.</i>

11:49.499 --> 11:50.665
<i>Next question.</i>

12:05.080 --> 12:08.683
<i>As I stated earlier, this is only
our preliminary investigation.</i>

12:08.685 --> 12:12.222
<i>We're still interviewing witnesses
and coordinating our efforts</i>

12:12.455 --> 12:15.059
<i>with our partners in the federl
law enforcement communities.</i>

12:16.625 --> 12:18.962
<i>It is our belief
that the individuals involved</i>

12:19.262 --> 12:21.965
<i>may have, in fact, planned to
assassinate him all along.</i>

12:24.133 --> 12:28.638
<i>I am certain that our associates with
the FI will have more to comment.</i>

13:01.838 --> 13:04.475
- Still having migraines?
- Yeah.

13:04.773 --> 13:06.143
How often?

13:07.076 --> 13:07.777
All the time.

13:09.311 --> 13:11.281
Follow the tip of my finger
with your eyes.

13:12.514 --> 13:13.716
What about the nightmares?

13:14.283 --> 13:15.284
Yeah.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.023
How often?

13:21.391 --> 13:22.459
Every night.

13:26.162 --> 13:29.697
Don't you think it's in his best
interest to extend his evaluation period

13:29.699 --> 13:32.369
at least until his long-term
memory comes back?

13:32.701 --> 13:34.404
That's not my concern.

13:35.271 --> 13:37.572
I don't know who you were
before all this happened,

13:37.574 --> 13:41.210
but maybe it's for the best if you
don't get those memories back.

13:45.248 --> 13:47.618
And lives were lost.
Do you really wanna know why?

13:49.619 --> 13:52.321
Well, if I have to
go to prison...

13:55.725 --> 13:57.127
I'd like to know why.

14:06.735 --> 14:08.172
What about his follow-up?

14:08.571 --> 14:09.773
It's out of my hands.

14:12.742 --> 14:14.578
Make sure he stays
on the prescribed regimen.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.114
Yes, Doctor.

14:17.312 --> 14:18.282
Thank you.

14:29.191 --> 14:30.661
- How's it going today?
- Good.

14:30.926 --> 14:33.397
Hmm. Looks good.

14:33.897 --> 14:35.465
You're sure
this is edible, right?

14:35.697 --> 14:37.430
Seemed fine the other day.

14:37.432 --> 14:38.468
Ah.

14:39.168 --> 14:40.136
Great.

14:52.949 --> 14:54.383
Hey, I'm Lucas.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.385
Just got in.

14:57.253 --> 14:58.122
Got?

14:58.620 --> 14:59.590
Excuse me?

14:59.788 --> 15:00.823
You said, "got."

15:02.292 --> 15:03.424
Yeah.

15:03.426 --> 15:04.628
People don't get in here.

15:05.260 --> 15:06.496
They're sent here.

15:07.629 --> 15:10.833
Yeah, well, a 72-hour
psychiatric evaluation.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.435
It's voluntary.

15:16.406 --> 15:17.474
Do I know you?

15:20.310 --> 15:23.180
You seem... familiar.

15:25.681 --> 15:29.353
No, you don't know me,
but I know you.

15:30.286 --> 15:31.255
How's that?

15:31.787 --> 15:32.922
Read all about you.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.593
Saw all those news stories
about you and that bank robbery.

15:37.393 --> 15:39.595
Well, then you know
more about it than I do.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.431
Ah. Well, I know
that you're not guilty.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.836
At least not for everything
they're accusing you for.

15:47.936 --> 15:48.906
How long you been here?

15:49.471 --> 15:50.606
What, a couple years?

15:53.008 --> 15:54.344
Seven years.

15:59.615 --> 16:02.485
I bet you're missing
life outside these walls.

16:04.753 --> 16:06.789
I'd bet even more that
you're desperate to get out.

16:20.736 --> 16:21.671
What's that?

16:23.339 --> 16:25.309
What if I told you
I can get you out of here?

16:27.542 --> 16:28.778
I'd say you're crazy.

16:30.147 --> 16:32.847
You mean to tell me, after all
this time you've spent in here,

16:32.849 --> 16:35.384
you can't tell the difference
between these nut jobs and me?

16:36.585 --> 16:37.921
Damn, I'm good.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.561
How would you
get me out of this place?

16:46.028 --> 16:50.767
As much as I'd like to take credit
for all of this, I got some help.

16:53.036 --> 16:54.537
Why are you doing this?

16:55.638 --> 16:57.273
I got 20 million reasons.

16:59.908 --> 17:00.943
If you read my case,

17:02.210 --> 17:04.712
you'd know that I don't have any
memory of what happened to me

17:04.714 --> 17:06.414
before I was sent to this place.

17:08.818 --> 17:13.557
Look, you wanna get out of here,
this is your chance.

17:14.455 --> 17:17.457
I'd say sleep on it, but I'm
being discharged tonight,

17:17.459 --> 17:20.596
so you gotta make a decision quick
'cause the clock is ticking.

17:22.031 --> 17:23.000
Trust me.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.569
Why would I trust you?

17:27.704 --> 17:29.005
You got any better options?

17:30.406 --> 17:31.707
Lunch is over, gentlemen!

17:39.682 --> 17:42.849
And Dr. Nichols is waiting
on you for your exit exam.

17:42.851 --> 17:43.919
Let's go.

17:48.991 --> 17:49.993
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

17:51.894 --> 17:53.530
Everything's gonna be all right.

17:56.631 --> 17:57.868
See you soon, Mac.

19:05.935 --> 19:08.071
Mac, how are you feeling?

19:11.107 --> 19:12.709
Like I was poisoned.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.747
The side effects
will only last a few hours.

19:20.116 --> 19:23.619
Here, take this.
It will help calm you down.

20:10.099 --> 20:12.867
- You done for the day?
- Uh, just finishing out the week.

20:12.869 --> 20:14.471
Go ahead and sign this.

20:20.275 --> 20:22.276
I'm gonna have to have you
open up that bag for me.

20:22.278 --> 20:24.677
Certainly.

20:24.679 --> 20:26.048
Ladies, can I see
your IDs, please?

20:39.861 --> 20:41.261
Just returning these to County.

20:41.263 --> 20:43.632
Uh, Dr. Nichols
signed off on it.

20:46.836 --> 20:48.872
Let's get you
to open up the back as well.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.173
Okay, give me a second.

20:53.743 --> 20:54.845
Can we hurry this up?

20:59.615 --> 21:00.717
Come on.

21:01.984 --> 21:04.020
<i>Dr. Coda to the ECT room.</i>

21:04.719 --> 21:06.789
<i>Dr. Coda to the ECT room.</i>

21:07.055 --> 21:08.057
Lights out, guys.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.724
Hey, did MacDonald
get moved back to his room?

21:11.726 --> 21:12.995
Not that I'm aware of.

21:14.696 --> 21:16.198
Let's go! Move it along!

21:22.705 --> 21:25.039
Damn it.
We got a problem, guys.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.076
Man.

21:30.679 --> 21:32.215
Alicia, what did I say?

21:35.051 --> 21:36.253
Such an asshole.

21:36.718 --> 21:37.818
You're good to go.

22:03.178 --> 22:04.813
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

22:06.048 --> 22:07.083
All right.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.649
You still think I'm crazy?

22:09.651 --> 22:10.719
Mm-hmm.

22:19.995 --> 22:22.165
Come on,
let's get you inside.

23:36.938 --> 23:39.308
It's fairly
catastrophic retrograde amnesia.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.077
You think it was real, or do
you think he was faking it?

23:43.079 --> 23:44.478
I believe it was real.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.249
His brain imaging
says it was real.

23:46.782 --> 23:49.450
Every neurological test we've
ever done said it was real.

23:49.452 --> 23:52.086
Detective, this was
the worst case I've seen.

23:52.088 --> 23:55.055
It took him six months
to learn how to walk again

23:55.057 --> 23:56.924
and another 12
just to learn how to speak.

23:56.926 --> 23:59.229
- Hmm.
- The man's lucky to have survived.

24:05.767 --> 24:06.802
Let me
ask you something.

24:08.737 --> 24:12.241
If it wasn't an act, how did
he get out of this place?

24:14.409 --> 24:15.978
Has he have any visitors lately?

24:17.245 --> 24:19.346
I've been here four years,

24:19.348 --> 24:21.882
and other than police investigators
and the occasional reporter,

24:21.884 --> 24:23.219
no one's come calling.

24:28.491 --> 24:29.990
Yeah?

24:29.992 --> 24:31.226
Just spoke to
one of the night nurses.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.464
She said a security guard
by the name of Farren Dell

24:35.063 --> 24:37.167
was a no-call, no-show
for work this morning.

24:37.899 --> 24:40.736
He was also one of the last people
to have spoken to MacDonald.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.473
Head over to his place and
tell me if you find anything.

24:46.475 --> 24:47.409
Okay.

24:50.245 --> 24:51.046
No more questions.

24:51.946 --> 24:54.147
<i>Police are following
several leads</i>

24:54.149 --> 24:56.482
<i>in the escape of famed bank
robber Donovan MacDonald.</i>

24:56.484 --> 24:59.488
<i>Authorities are not speculating how
they believe MacDonald got away,</i>

24:59.988 --> 25:01.922
<i>but are pursuing leads
in a person of interest...</i>

25:01.924 --> 25:03.557
You'll need this.

25:03.559 --> 25:05.862
<i>Our Karen Matthews
is on the scene.</i>

25:17.005 --> 25:18.774
What do you know
about your case, Mac?

25:21.843 --> 25:24.346
I've been asked a lot of
questions over the years, but...

25:26.482 --> 25:29.219
And it always seems like they're
talking about someone else.

25:33.022 --> 25:34.858
I've been accused
of a lot of things.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.928
I'd like to know the truth.

25:42.965 --> 25:44.466
We can help you
with that.

25:47.468 --> 25:49.471
This will help you relax
before we begin.

25:54.376 --> 25:55.845
Before we begin what?

26:06.988 --> 26:08.357
There's somebody outside.

26:09.425 --> 26:10.426
Keep him here.

26:30.512 --> 26:31.513
Get in here.

26:35.251 --> 26:35.952
Were you followed?

26:36.517 --> 26:38.120
I left behind
a few bread crumbs.

26:40.656 --> 26:41.890
Hey, Mac.

26:42.491 --> 26:43.893
You already know Farren.

26:48.496 --> 26:49.532
Uh, okay.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.035
Obviously, you guys
know who I am.

26:55.471 --> 26:56.406
Who are you?

27:00.341 --> 27:01.910
You're not a security guard.

27:05.546 --> 27:06.915
- You're not...
- Crazy?

27:09.484 --> 27:10.520
Are you a nurse?

27:11.387 --> 27:12.856
I was in a former life.

27:13.388 --> 27:14.556
How fast can we do this?

27:17.426 --> 27:18.328
Do what?

27:22.965 --> 27:24.067
Why don't you come with me, Mac?

27:25.067 --> 27:25.969
Let's go upstairs.

27:27.101 --> 27:28.702
- Now, hold on a minute.
- No, no, no.

27:28.704 --> 27:30.138
- No.
- Come on.

27:31.072 --> 27:32.441
- Listen...
- Come on.

27:42.685 --> 27:44.186
Let me show you something, Mac.

28:08.010 --> 28:10.079
Well, most of this
is public record.

28:12.715 --> 28:15.952
But this? This is
the important stuff.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.956
And according to
the police report,

28:21.490 --> 28:23.322
the lead detective was a guy
by the name of...

28:23.324 --> 28:24.494
Sykes.

28:27.562 --> 28:28.497
I know him.

28:30.599 --> 28:32.601
He's been coming to the hospital
for years.

28:35.370 --> 28:37.139
Always asking me questions.

28:40.676 --> 28:41.577
Sounds about right.

28:44.213 --> 28:46.148
This is something
you might be interested in.

28:53.288 --> 28:54.557
The ballistics report...

28:56.125 --> 29:00.263
which clearly indicates that the bullets
that killed Ike Foster and John Truby...

29:01.330 --> 29:04.067
weren't fired by any of the
weapons recovered at the scene.

29:09.271 --> 29:10.406
So you tell me.

29:12.206 --> 29:13.309
How does that happen?

29:15.610 --> 29:19.314
Well, if I didn't kill 'em,
who did?

29:32.226 --> 29:34.493
We've got reports coming in
from the state troopers.

29:34.495 --> 29:37.597
They've set up roadblocks and
checkpoints at state line and the 95.

29:37.599 --> 29:39.566
All right, get it on the board.

29:39.568 --> 29:42.234
Okay, we've got another hit
from a gas station attendant

29:42.236 --> 29:44.404
that thinks they spotted
what looks like a cargo van

29:44.406 --> 29:48.176
headed southbound
on Veterans Highway to the 204.

29:49.677 --> 29:52.348
That makes no sense. They'd
be over by Hunter Airfield.

29:53.682 --> 29:55.551
You're scrambling
your resources too thin.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.320
By our estimates, this guy's
already got a massive head start.

30:01.322 --> 30:04.191
Detective, I am sure
you know FBI Agent Franks,

30:04.193 --> 30:06.763
and this is his new partner,
Karl Hicks.

30:09.798 --> 30:12.365
We already extended
our perimeter out 20 miles.

30:12.367 --> 30:13.703
What else would you
have in mind?

30:17.638 --> 30:21.374
And I thought the marshals were
responsible for fugitive capture.

30:21.376 --> 30:24.446
And you've had seven years to solve
these homicides, but you got nothing.

30:26.215 --> 30:30.153
So now that the primary suspect
is out, it lands on my desk.

30:32.454 --> 30:34.320
Yeah, you know,
that's gonna fit in perfectly

30:34.322 --> 30:36.758
with all the evidence
you haven't given our team.

30:43.398 --> 30:46.599
Captain, I expect your
department's full cooperation.

30:46.601 --> 30:49.071
I've already spoken
to your special agent in charge.

30:49.838 --> 30:52.338
What you know
about Central City Bank

30:52.340 --> 30:55.677
could provide the missing details
that ties our cold case together.

30:56.145 --> 30:59.215
You two have been working opposite
ends of the same case for years.

31:00.282 --> 31:03.653
You want our cooperation,
we'll expect full transparency.

31:04.520 --> 31:05.551
You'll have it.

31:05.553 --> 31:06.656
Detective?

31:11.926 --> 31:16.666
Look, the briefing we got before we
headed over here was limited at best.

31:19.167 --> 31:20.570
You're the specialist
on this one.

31:21.336 --> 31:23.406
I need to know
who we're going after.

31:24.540 --> 31:25.575
Is he really nuts?

31:26.274 --> 31:27.310
You ever think about that?

31:28.176 --> 31:30.446
Is this guy really crazy,
or is he putting us on?

31:33.314 --> 31:37.152
Well, seven years is a hell of a
long time to wait and play a game.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.759
All three of these guys
lived here most of their lives.

31:45.494 --> 31:47.629
Then again,
you already know that, right?

31:48.330 --> 31:49.564
You know more about them...

31:50.799 --> 31:51.834
than we do.

31:53.734 --> 31:54.637
Hmm.

31:55.637 --> 31:56.672
The bank they robbed...

31:57.872 --> 32:00.242
we were told the FBI was
investigating them for fraud.

32:01.475 --> 32:02.410
That's right.

32:03.678 --> 32:04.880
So what were you looking for?

32:08.783 --> 32:09.752
Okay.

32:11.386 --> 32:13.252
It seems the owners
of the cement factory

32:13.254 --> 32:14.820
took out a $30 million
line of credit

32:14.822 --> 32:16.859
with their friends
over at Central City Bank,

32:17.693 --> 32:21.430
while using the employee
pension funds as collateral.

32:23.264 --> 32:25.301
And before
filing for bankruptcy,

32:25.934 --> 32:29.272
they took annual bonuses
in excess of $24 million,

32:29.972 --> 32:33.341
leaving the people
who built that company...

32:34.376 --> 32:35.545
high and dry.

32:39.313 --> 32:40.749
You've known about this
all along?

32:43.551 --> 32:47.253
Our forensic accountants took over two
years looking through their books.

32:47.255 --> 32:48.590
Couldn't prove a damn thing.

32:48.889 --> 32:51.860
It was all handshakes
and gentleman's agreements.

32:52.426 --> 32:54.461
The bank knew exactly
what they were doing,

32:54.463 --> 32:56.666
but they turned
a blind eye to it because...

32:58.332 --> 32:59.534
their money was covered.

33:00.002 --> 33:02.405
But without proof,
there was no indictment.

33:10.544 --> 33:12.444
This is an LPT enhancer.

33:12.446 --> 33:13.482
A what?

33:15.050 --> 33:17.416
A drug that stimulates the frontal lobe
of the brain, which controls memory.

33:17.418 --> 33:20.953
Look, I've been stuck
with every truth serum

33:20.955 --> 33:23.857
and memory enhancer
ever invented.

33:23.859 --> 33:25.227
Not this one.

33:26.994 --> 33:28.531
How do you figure?

33:29.063 --> 33:31.300
Because it just finished
clinical trials.

33:31.899 --> 33:34.567
Over 80% of the patients
who took this

33:34.569 --> 33:36.839
regained almost 40%
of their memory.

33:38.407 --> 33:39.809
What happened to
the other 20%?

33:40.375 --> 33:41.277
They died.

33:48.917 --> 33:54.756
Look, I have no recollection of
what happened to me in my past,

33:55.323 --> 33:58.526
and I'm not gonna let you guys fry
my brain, trying to figure it out.

33:59.828 --> 34:03.663
There is $20 million in cash
hidden out there,

34:03.665 --> 34:06.031
and we believe that you know
where it's stashed,

34:06.033 --> 34:07.834
and we're not the only ones
looking for it,

34:07.836 --> 34:09.902
so if you wanna survive
the next couple of days,

34:09.904 --> 34:11.471
I suggest
you start working with us!

34:11.473 --> 34:12.375
Hey!

34:18.947 --> 34:21.350
There's an 80% chance
this stuff will work?

34:23.051 --> 34:23.985
Yes.

34:25.886 --> 34:27.054
What are the side effects?

34:33.828 --> 34:34.862
Oh...

34:37.431 --> 34:38.333
Go ahead. Tell him.

34:39.567 --> 34:41.835
It's not going to be pleasant.

34:42.837 --> 34:46.940
Dizziness, vertigo,
possible hallucinations,

34:46.942 --> 34:49.878
and those headaches of yours
are gonna get much, much worse.

34:51.145 --> 34:52.580
Good news is...

34:53.915 --> 34:56.951
you remember where you buried
the money, and we all prosper.

35:02.022 --> 35:03.625
This doesn't work by itself.

35:04.927 --> 35:06.595
We're going to have to expose you
to some places from your past.

35:12.933 --> 35:15.870
So you think this is gonna
release my memories?

35:17.139 --> 35:19.706
It takes about 15 minutes
to start working.

35:19.708 --> 35:20.776
Okay.

35:23.744 --> 35:26.915
I'm gonna need you
to remain incredibly still.

35:33.487 --> 35:34.989
You're gonna wanna
bite down on this.

35:39.627 --> 35:40.729
Trust me.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.002
It has to be
injected directly...

35:48.869 --> 35:51.137
into your spinal fluid.

35:51.139 --> 35:52.875
Hold him down.

35:54.409 --> 35:56.078
- - Mac, I'm sorry.
This is gonna hurt like hell.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.478
- Hold him.
- Hey, hey, hey!

36:04.685 --> 36:07.856
Just relax.
Breathe. Breathe.

36:42.190 --> 36:44.092
- You guys have been busy.
- Yeah.

36:48.864 --> 36:49.999
Who's this?

36:50.799 --> 36:53.668
A hunch. All of this
is still speculation.

36:54.002 --> 36:56.138
- Let's be clear about that.
- Right.

36:56.904 --> 36:59.908
None of the weapons used at the
crime scene match the ballistics.

37:00.574 --> 37:01.944
Someone else
had to be involved.

37:03.411 --> 37:06.781
How many people worked at this place
before they closed their doors?

37:07.047 --> 37:08.183
About 115.

37:10.518 --> 37:11.619
A hundred and fifteen.

37:13.154 --> 37:16.154
I'm sure that doesn't
include contractors

37:16.156 --> 37:21.226
or guys like Foster, whose businesses
depended upon this place, right?

37:21.228 --> 37:22.130
Yeah.

37:23.297 --> 37:25.801
Well, there's your fourth man
right there, Detective.

37:26.668 --> 37:29.772
Every one of those people had a
motive, just like MacDonald.

37:35.976 --> 37:37.110
We gotta get him up.

37:38.279 --> 37:39.482
- Come on.
- Wait!

37:39.781 --> 37:41.079
- Stand up, Mac.
- Wait.

37:41.081 --> 37:42.882
- Come on, stand up.
- Easy.

37:42.884 --> 37:45.183
You can't
push him like this, Farren.

37:45.185 --> 37:48.186
Stopping every 10 minutes isn't gonna
cut it, not with the window we have.

37:48.188 --> 37:50.058
- Wait! Wait!
- Come on.

37:50.592 --> 37:52.094
I know...

37:52.860 --> 37:53.929
I know this place.

37:56.764 --> 37:58.100
Wait.

38:02.571 --> 38:03.973
I've been here before.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.978
What are you seeing, Mac?

38:17.351 --> 38:18.587
Fragments.

38:24.659 --> 38:26.161
All I see is fragments.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.532
Fragments.

38:36.103 --> 38:37.540
Fragments.

38:39.074 --> 38:40.672
I see in fragments.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.249
Why do I know this place?

38:52.821 --> 38:53.755
Wait.

38:58.393 --> 38:59.762
Where are we?

39:02.330 --> 39:04.163
You guys need to speed this up.

39:04.165 --> 39:06.601
What did she just tell you?
You can't fast-track this.

39:09.737 --> 39:11.103
- Give him another shot.
- Farren!

39:11.105 --> 39:12.140
It could kill him.

39:14.275 --> 39:16.643
Do you really wanna waste
the last six years of your life?

39:16.645 --> 39:19.148
Ah, shit. Get him inside now.
Come on.

39:19.913 --> 39:22.248
Get him in. Come on, come on!
Get him in now! Hurry!

39:22.250 --> 39:23.715
- Come on, Mac.
- Come on.

39:23.717 --> 39:24.786
Stay with me.

39:26.054 --> 39:27.356
- I know this place.
- It's the police. Keep him quiet.

39:27.922 --> 39:28.891
Shit.

39:29.257 --> 39:30.259
I know this place.

39:30.891 --> 39:32.293
All right, follow my lead.
Come on.

40:04.259 --> 40:06.025
That's why I told him they're asking
too much. I've read the inspection.

40:06.027 --> 40:08.960
No, they're out of their minds if they think
they're getting that much for the auction.

40:08.962 --> 40:10.096
How you doing, sir?

40:10.098 --> 40:12.264
Hey, can I call you back? Yeah.

40:12.266 --> 40:13.969
- Can you hang up the phone?
- Yes, sir.

40:15.270 --> 40:16.804
- Afternoon, Officer.
- Afternoon.

40:17.205 --> 40:18.306
You got business here?

40:19.074 --> 40:20.239
This is private property.

40:20.241 --> 40:21.710
Place has
already been foreclosed.

40:23.177 --> 40:24.444
You told me
the title was clear.

40:24.446 --> 40:25.681
It is.

40:27.415 --> 40:29.685
I'm sorry, sir. Uh...

40:30.284 --> 40:31.353
I was...

40:33.455 --> 40:37.155
I was only out here because the
bank had listed it for auction.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.736
You say you're out here
looking at buying this property?

40:50.404 --> 40:51.406
Yes, sir.

40:52.507 --> 40:54.806
I need a place to run my horses.

40:57.478 --> 40:59.814
Shh...
Keep your head down. Shh...

41:00.848 --> 41:03.151
Call me crazy, but I had
a mind to renovate it...

41:03.918 --> 41:05.387
back to its old,
beautiful self.

41:06.855 --> 41:07.923
Really?

41:09.857 --> 41:11.125
How 'bout you show me some ID?

41:15.196 --> 41:16.065
Yeah.

41:19.833 --> 41:20.835
Come on.

41:21.835 --> 41:22.971
How 'bout that ID?

41:24.371 --> 41:25.873
Keep it quiet.

41:29.177 --> 41:30.446
348, go ahead.

41:30.878 --> 41:31.813
Give me a second.

41:34.516 --> 41:36.351
348, I copy.
You can show me en route.

41:37.118 --> 41:38.483
Folks, I gotta clear.

41:38.485 --> 41:40.319
Like I said,
this is private property.

41:40.321 --> 41:42.491
Have the proper documentation
if you're gonna be here.

41:43.924 --> 41:44.892
Yes, sir.

41:51.266 --> 41:53.398
Calm down. Come on.
Gotta get you up.

41:54.935 --> 41:56.370
Come on, get up.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.442
Come on, come on.

42:02.076 --> 42:03.846
All right, sit down, sit down.

42:05.013 --> 42:06.114
Jesus Christ.

42:06.547 --> 42:08.082
He just lost his shit
up there.

42:09.384 --> 42:10.319
- It's okay.
- He just freaked the hell out.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.923
It's all right.
Just breathe through it.

42:17.491 --> 42:19.327
It took everything I had
to hold him down.

42:24.264 --> 42:26.100
Everything's
gonna be all right.

42:40.447 --> 42:42.049
I know this place.

42:48.089 --> 42:49.257
You used to live here.

42:51.458 --> 42:52.828
That's why
we brought you here.

42:58.199 --> 42:59.234
It's working.

43:03.371 --> 43:04.807
Why don't you
get the equipment?

43:05.239 --> 43:06.375
I'll meet you
at the truck.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.051
All right, Mac,
let's get you out of here.

43:16.284 --> 43:17.886
Come on.

43:28.395 --> 43:30.531
Everything's in range.
His vitals are good.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.002
- Keep him talking.
- Just focus.

43:59.427 --> 44:00.495
What is this place?

44:04.132 --> 44:07.168
One of the men who died in
the shoot-out used to work here.

44:14.141 --> 44:15.877
You were talking
this whole time, Mac.

44:16.344 --> 44:17.479
You brought us here.

44:50.143 --> 44:51.612
Every cop in the state
is looking for us.

44:52.346 --> 44:54.348
Why are we wasting our time
with this bullshit?

44:54.748 --> 44:56.517
It has to have
some order to it.

44:57.018 --> 44:59.221
He's rebuilding the story
of his past.

45:00.755 --> 45:01.987
I don't trust this guy.

45:01.989 --> 45:03.125
I don't trust him either.

45:04.692 --> 45:06.094
It was someone else.

45:07.328 --> 45:08.230
Oh.

45:09.197 --> 45:10.965
Is it somebody
you worked with?

45:12.333 --> 45:13.502
Maybe someone
that worked here?

45:14.701 --> 45:15.670
Truby.

45:19.107 --> 45:21.773
Truby was working
with someone.

45:21.775 --> 45:23.478
He's the one that's gonna
help us get away clean.

45:24.011 --> 45:25.479
He was gonna
cover our tracks.

45:25.712 --> 45:28.681
How long can you survive on unemployment?
Huh? What about you?

45:28.683 --> 45:30.782
You gonna go back to towing barges?
Is that what you want?

45:30.784 --> 45:32.250
This is fucking crazy.

45:32.252 --> 45:34.088
This is all we have
right now, guys.

45:44.232 --> 45:45.730
He's gonna meet us here
later tonight.

45:47.235 --> 45:48.733
Stay with it, Mac.

45:48.735 --> 45:51.072
That guy is not coming
anywhere near my place.

45:51.672 --> 45:53.271
<i>You can trust him,
all right?</i>

45:53.273 --> 45:54.273
He's not coming here!

45:54.275 --> 45:55.210
You can trust him!

45:56.177 --> 45:57.746
He's the one that told me
about our pensions.

46:00.313 --> 46:02.447
Where's the money?

46:21.802 --> 46:24.172
I don't know
where the money is!

46:29.277 --> 46:30.378
My eyes.

46:34.382 --> 46:36.248
Can't you give me
something for the pain?

46:36.250 --> 46:38.387
Not without
negative side effects.

46:55.335 --> 46:56.670
It was by the water.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.542
A river.

47:03.511 --> 47:05.147
It was by a river,
and there was...

47:20.862 --> 47:22.364
cement towers.

47:22.797 --> 47:25.230
There were cement towers
by a river.

47:25.232 --> 47:26.234
I got it.

47:30.538 --> 47:32.574
Give me the keys.
Grab him now. Let's go.

47:34.475 --> 47:35.777
I got him.

47:36.344 --> 47:37.909
Come on. I got him.
I got him.

47:37.911 --> 47:39.547
- Let's go!
- You're okay, Mac.

47:45.319 --> 47:46.388
Seven years ago,

47:48.221 --> 47:50.792
we had the most violent attack
this city has ever seen.

47:54.328 --> 47:55.895
And the only thing
we had going

47:55.897 --> 47:57.532
were the leads
that we publicized.

47:59.199 --> 48:01.703
We're gonna be working
with the FBI.

48:04.938 --> 48:07.442
Stay sharp. These guys will
kill for what they're after.

48:09.877 --> 48:11.112
Now go.

48:12.446 --> 48:13.447
Stay sharp.

48:13.915 --> 48:15.382
- Excuse me.
- I mean it.

48:15.949 --> 48:16.951
Pretty powerful statement.

48:18.719 --> 48:21.389
You said you just leaked
information to the press.

48:21.688 --> 48:22.723
You lied.

48:24.225 --> 48:25.226
Don't worry about it.

48:26.661 --> 48:29.762
Look, I need you to push
these checkpoints out.

48:29.764 --> 48:31.730
Get the word out
to Transit Authority...

48:31.732 --> 48:32.801
Franks.

48:33.601 --> 48:34.903
I need you in my office.

48:37.438 --> 48:38.507
Excuse me.

48:52.920 --> 48:53.788
Jesus.

48:54.522 --> 48:55.887
What a fucking mess.

49:00.962 --> 49:01.929
Carter.

49:02.897 --> 49:04.366
Carter, you get any hits
on the security guard?

49:05.799 --> 49:07.699
It looks like he stole the identification
from the real Farren Dell,

49:07.701 --> 49:10.437
who died in a car crash
last April in Atlanta.

49:10.638 --> 49:12.570
I got the techs
dusting for prints right now,

49:12.572 --> 49:14.672
but it looks like he wiped this
place clean before he left.

49:14.674 --> 49:15.810
You guys get anything yet?

49:16.476 --> 49:17.878
Nothing.

49:19.513 --> 49:20.445
<i>All right, I was gonna head
back to the hospital after this.</i>

49:20.447 --> 49:21.579
<i>I got them running
background checks</i>

49:21.581 --> 49:24.349
on all the employees
who had contact with MacDonald.

49:24.351 --> 49:26.353
Remember that old cement factory
he used to work at?

49:26.686 --> 49:28.387
Yeah, we combed through
that place for months.

49:28.389 --> 49:29.657
Didn't find a damn thing.

49:30.924 --> 49:32.459
<i>Maybe we weren't
looking in the right place.</i>

49:32.860 --> 49:35.463
You see something, you call me.

49:37.598 --> 49:38.532
Okay.

49:39.567 --> 49:40.666
You guys let me know
the minute you find something,

49:40.668 --> 49:41.636
- all right?
- Okay.

50:28.715 --> 50:29.851
Come on, Mac.

51:02.482 --> 51:03.884
Something happened here.

51:12.726 --> 51:14.529
- Should I go help him?
- No.

51:14.761 --> 51:16.395
If we step between him
and his past,

51:16.397 --> 51:17.766
it could fragment
the imagery.

51:18.866 --> 51:20.335
Let him stay with it.

51:52.933 --> 51:54.436
Grab him.
Let's get him inside.

51:54.969 --> 51:56.534
- Come on, Mac.
- Stay with it.

51:56.536 --> 51:57.504
Come on. Let's go.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.076
Hold on.

52:08.616 --> 52:09.751
It's too much on him.

52:10.049 --> 52:11.550
Right over there. Let's go.

52:11.552 --> 52:12.587
He needs to sit down.

52:12.987 --> 52:13.888
Come on.

52:14.621 --> 52:15.589
Let me sit him down.

52:16.590 --> 52:17.958
Come on, Mac.
Right here, right here.

52:18.793 --> 52:19.861
Sit down.

52:20.962 --> 52:23.764
I need you to keep your eyes
closed for a few minutes.

52:34.808 --> 52:35.743
Come on.

52:36.576 --> 52:38.412
Sit up gently,
gently, gently.

52:40.047 --> 52:41.850
You spent
most of your life here, Mac,

52:42.882 --> 52:44.418
sometimes six days
out of the week.

52:48.589 --> 52:49.924
You used to work
right in there.

53:10.578 --> 53:11.545
Take this.

53:18.585 --> 53:19.587
Let's go.

53:55.221 --> 53:56.123
There.

54:05.866 --> 54:07.168
We came in through there.

54:08.636 --> 54:09.634
Up the steps?

54:09.636 --> 54:10.904
I'll lead the way.

54:27.621 --> 54:28.523
There.

54:41.735 --> 54:43.037
Oh, shit!

54:58.685 --> 54:59.686
Shit.

55:02.221 --> 55:03.624
Give me the bag.

55:06.192 --> 55:07.694
It's so real.

55:10.964 --> 55:12.232
It can't be up here.

55:12.967 --> 55:14.903
All the reports
said you buried it.

55:17.670 --> 55:18.572
No.

55:19.639 --> 55:20.708
Give me the other bag.

55:22.643 --> 55:23.545
No.

55:24.011 --> 55:24.878
No.

55:27.214 --> 55:28.215
Give me the shovel.

55:32.619 --> 55:33.888
We were never gonna bury it.

55:56.076 --> 55:58.712
We sent it down
one of these conveyor belts.

56:06.119 --> 56:07.888
It's gotta be
in one of those silos.

56:08.788 --> 56:10.188
Let's go. You're with me.

56:10.190 --> 56:11.292
Come on.

56:16.429 --> 56:18.362
You take this side.
I'll take this side.

56:18.364 --> 56:19.333
Yeah.

56:26.272 --> 56:27.240
You got anything?

56:28.775 --> 56:29.676
Nothing!

56:31.078 --> 56:32.080
It's gotta be down here.

56:33.246 --> 56:34.648
Nah, this place is empty.

56:45.192 --> 56:46.927
What do you got? Anything?

56:47.828 --> 56:49.730
Still nothing, man.
Keep looking.

56:50.864 --> 56:52.166
Got one more, come on.

57:01.407 --> 57:02.844
It's down here,
I know it.

57:08.181 --> 57:09.116
I got nothing.

57:09.717 --> 57:10.685
Me either.

57:13.886 --> 57:15.089
There's no money here.

57:23.464 --> 57:24.732
Junkyard.

57:26.967 --> 57:27.969
You see that there?

57:28.802 --> 57:29.737
Yeah.

57:34.174 --> 57:35.773
No, no, no, no, no.

57:35.775 --> 57:36.710
What are you looking at?

57:39.078 --> 57:41.045
If they threw those
bags on the conveyor belt,

57:41.047 --> 57:43.450
they wouldn't have fed into the
silos unless it was operational.

57:45.284 --> 57:47.254
Yeah, that's right.

57:48.855 --> 57:49.991
What does it connect to?

57:51.125 --> 57:52.025
The conveyor...

57:53.259 --> 57:54.995
connects to a dumping bin.

58:17.551 --> 58:18.853
There's something in there.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.161
Here, grab this bar.

58:45.846 --> 58:48.315
Farren,
there's a cop out there.

58:49.348 --> 58:50.317
Farren!

58:54.487 --> 58:55.857
Grab him, grab him!

58:56.958 --> 58:57.922
- Come on, come on.
- Keep him out of sight!

58:57.924 --> 58:59.824
No, there's someone
from law enforcement.

58:59.826 --> 59:02.293
Keep him quiet
and out of sight, hear me?

59:02.295 --> 59:03.895
- Whoever that is...
- Get him in!

59:03.897 --> 59:04.962
He's gonna kill us.

59:04.964 --> 59:06.333
<i>He's gonna kill us!</i>

59:09.335 --> 59:11.104
<i>He's the one that's
gonna help us get away clean.</i>

59:12.839 --> 59:14.374
<i>Why would we
involve a cop?</i>

59:15.208 --> 59:16.377
They're trying to kill us!

59:23.317 --> 59:24.318
No.

59:28.255 --> 59:29.957
It's gonna be all right.

59:37.397 --> 59:38.299
What?

59:41.335 --> 59:42.369
What did you say?

59:43.337 --> 59:44.469
Do I know you?

59:44.471 --> 59:45.806
Do you?

59:49.909 --> 59:51.208
<i>Are you a nurse?</i>

59:51.210 --> 59:52.813
I was in a former life.

59:53.947 --> 59:55.550
Everything's gonna be all right.

59:58.951 --> 01:00:00.420
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:07.561
You're not
a security guard.

01:00:13.232 --> 01:00:14.933
Dad, if we get your gear,

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:16.902
we might have
some daylight left.

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:17.871
- Let's ride.
- Go!

01:00:21.674 --> 01:00:23.076
I had a family.

01:00:27.413 --> 01:00:29.116
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:31.886
Why didn't you tell me?

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.388
Those trials
I told you about,

01:00:36.156 --> 01:00:38.556
the patients that didn't
regain their memories

01:00:38.558 --> 01:00:40.561
thought it was
all fake and planted.

01:00:43.996 --> 01:00:45.963
They refused
to believe in it.

01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:48.132
This was the only way
that would've worked.

01:00:51.304 --> 01:00:54.341
This... this is all my fault.

01:00:56.243 --> 01:00:58.145
Fuck.

01:01:37.384 --> 01:01:38.616
So what are you saying?

01:01:38.618 --> 01:01:39.953
Come on, what do you got?

01:01:41.388 --> 01:01:43.121
I thought you said
we were clear of the locals.

01:01:43.123 --> 01:01:44.025
<i>How many are there?</i>

01:01:44.824 --> 01:01:45.292
<i>We only have the one.</i>

01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:48.628
<i>Call 911.</i>

01:01:49.763 --> 01:01:51.165
<i>Give them some bullshit site
far away from there.</i>

01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:54.267
We might be in business.

01:02:00.473 --> 01:02:02.208
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

01:02:03.743 --> 01:02:05.712
Uh, yeah, I think my wife and I just
saw the guy that you're looking for.

01:02:06.246 --> 01:02:07.281
The one that escaped.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:09.047
<i>Okay, sir. Just stay calm
and don't hang up.</i>

01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:10.382
<i>Can you provide me with your...</i>

01:02:16.489 --> 01:02:17.457
Are you sure?

01:02:18.725 --> 01:02:20.525
Agent Franks, we got a confirmed
sighting in Brunswick.

01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:21.662
Brunswick?

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:23.695
That's a hell of a lot
farther out than we thought.

01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:26.197
Yeah, it's at least
60 miles south of here.

01:02:26.199 --> 01:02:27.565
What's the area like
down there?

01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:30.204
Waterways, mostly.
Interconnected islands.

01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:31.605
Send somebody. Hurry.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:33.407
<i>Sir, just stay on the line...</i>

01:02:34.373 --> 01:02:35.342
All right.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.011
Captain,
we've seen this before.

01:02:37.511 --> 01:02:39.543
If we don't get a net
around him now,

01:02:39.545 --> 01:02:42.415
there are thousands of escape
routes across those shipping lines.

01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:44.584
Dispatch lost connection
with the caller.

01:03:03.369 --> 01:03:04.438
I'm coming with you.

01:03:05.605 --> 01:03:07.475
No, Detective, I need you
to be my eyes and ears here.

01:03:08.074 --> 01:03:10.210
Look out for the locals and
give me their exact location.

01:03:10.444 --> 01:03:11.344
Let's go.

01:03:22.389 --> 01:03:23.657
Metro Police!

01:03:24.491 --> 01:03:27.395
If you are in this facility,
you are trespassing!

01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:31.031
I need you to come out
where I can see you!

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:50.518
Talk to me, Carter.

01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:54.786
Yeah, either we got
a few well-off transients

01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:56.387
who are camping out
for the night,

01:03:56.389 --> 01:03:57.521
or your hunch
might be right.

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:58.625
You want me to call it in?

01:04:00.159 --> 01:04:01.094
I'm on my way.

01:04:01.594 --> 01:04:02.596
Copy that.

01:04:08.868 --> 01:04:09.803
Those people,

01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:13.206
they've come for the money.

01:04:13.572 --> 01:04:15.375
That's the only thing
they want.

01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:18.112
If they get it...

01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:20.447
we're dead.

01:04:22.781 --> 01:04:24.384
Let's get to it first.

01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:36.830
Go and get Farren.

01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:39.799
- Get him! Bring him back!
- Okay.

01:04:48.808 --> 01:04:49.810
After you, Pops.

01:05:17.904 --> 01:05:18.806
That's it.

01:06:39.853 --> 01:06:41.255
I say again,

01:06:41.888 --> 01:06:43.489
this is Metro Police!

01:06:45.357 --> 01:06:46.859
Come out and show yourselves!

01:06:48.328 --> 01:06:49.029
I'm here.

01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:51.232
Hands in the air!
Do not move!

01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:53.834
Who else is here?

01:06:55.034 --> 01:06:55.935
Just me.

01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:59.505
Bullshit.
I see three packs.

01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:02.308
Where's the rest of them?

01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:05.543
I'm not gonna ask you again!
Where's the rest of them?

01:07:05.545 --> 01:07:07.281
I'm right here. Right here.

01:07:07.746 --> 01:07:09.549
I'm pretty sure I'm the
one you're looking for.

01:07:12.451 --> 01:07:13.353
Dell?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.289
Farren Dell?

01:07:18.491 --> 01:07:19.627
Get in where I can see you.

01:07:19.926 --> 01:07:21.527
She had nothing
to do with it.

01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:23.630
Nothing.

01:07:25.831 --> 01:07:27.831
- Where's MacDonald?
- He's gone.

01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:30.370
- What do you mean?
- We buried him yesterday.

01:07:33.406 --> 01:07:34.775
Just keep your hands up
in the air.

01:07:53.493 --> 01:07:54.728
Carter, are you there?

01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:57.764
I got a couple of them standing
right here in front of me.

01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:03.203
<i>You were right.</i>

01:08:03.802 --> 01:08:05.503
They were here
the whole damn time.

01:08:05.505 --> 01:08:06.607
I'm ten minutes out.

01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:08.308
I need you to roll
everyone in the area...

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:29.330
Get back! Get back!

01:09:24.683 --> 01:09:25.618
Carter, you there?

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.475
Come on, now.

01:09:49.942 --> 01:09:51.743
Ready? Okay.

01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:23.843
Farren!

01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:49.203
Farren!

01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:54.807
Farren!

01:10:57.643 --> 01:10:58.544
Farren!

01:11:17.797 --> 01:11:18.866
I remember.

01:11:19.598 --> 01:11:20.801
I remember.

01:11:22.634 --> 01:11:23.669
I'm sorry.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:25.605
I'm so sorry.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:49.830
I'm so sorry.

01:12:24.864 --> 01:12:26.066
In here, in here.

01:12:27.633 --> 01:12:29.199
Go get the money!
Go!

01:12:29.201 --> 01:12:30.835
It's the only thing
keeping us alive!

01:12:32.405 --> 01:12:34.875
I've got you covered.
I've got you covered.

01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:39.011
All right, move!
Let's go, let's go!

01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.290
Right through, right through!

01:13:07.973 --> 01:13:10.207
<i>Freeze! Freeze!</i>

01:13:10.209 --> 01:13:11.178
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

01:13:12.111 --> 01:13:13.877
- Show me your hands!
- We're not armed!

01:13:13.879 --> 01:13:14.780
Get them out here!

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.282
Get up, come on.

01:13:20.953 --> 01:13:22.289
Let's go. Bring them here.

01:13:23.923 --> 01:13:24.925
Right here.

01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:27.894
Where is he?

01:13:28.361 --> 01:13:29.663
Where's Mac?

01:13:34.232 --> 01:13:35.802
Congratulations, Mac!

01:13:37.102 --> 01:13:39.269
We must've swept this place
a dozen times,

01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:41.040
<i>couldn't find a damn thing.</i>

01:13:41.441 --> 01:13:42.342
<i>Nothing!</i>

01:13:43.142 --> 01:13:46.476
Not a sign
where you stashed it.

01:13:46.478 --> 01:13:47.813
Come on out, Mac!

01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:51.916
Come on!
Let's work this out.

01:13:54.187 --> 01:13:55.822
Like we did last time?

01:13:58.023 --> 01:13:59.959
We had a deal,
and you broke it!

01:14:03.228 --> 01:14:04.931
That's not the way
I remember it.

01:14:05.431 --> 01:14:07.701
You killed Truby and Foster!

01:14:09.468 --> 01:14:11.937
That's because
they didn't stick to our plan!

01:14:14.339 --> 01:14:16.743
You were never gonna
stick to our plan!

01:14:17.142 --> 01:14:19.779
I was the one
taking all the risks, Mac.

01:14:20.879 --> 01:14:22.715
That money needed
to be laundered.

01:14:23.048 --> 01:14:25.118
Every one of those bills
could've been marked.

01:14:28.521 --> 01:14:32.259
Every serial number could've
been tracked back to us.

01:14:34.494 --> 01:14:36.730
You didn't think about that,
did you?

01:14:39.365 --> 01:14:41.301
No one was supposed
to get killed.

01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:44.838
All right,
enough talking!

01:14:47.373 --> 01:14:49.810
You come out now,
and I won't kill you, too!

01:14:50.075 --> 01:14:51.410
You can't kill me!

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:54.313
I died seven years ago.

01:15:00.018 --> 01:15:02.289
What I did,
I did for my family!

01:15:04.856 --> 01:15:06.025
I'm sure you did.

01:15:07.226 --> 01:15:09.730
You planned on killing us
all along!

01:15:10.295 --> 01:15:12.331
That's right.

01:15:23.276 --> 01:15:25.943
I should've put another bullet
through your head!

01:15:25.945 --> 01:15:27.848
Give me the money!

01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:29.883
I'll give you the money...

01:15:31.817 --> 01:15:33.085
but it's a new deal.

01:15:34.352 --> 01:15:37.923
You let my wife and my son go,

01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:42.194
and I'll give it all to you,
all 15 million.

01:15:45.097 --> 01:15:47.834
No, not that simple anymore,
Mac!

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:52.372
You exposed us!

01:15:53.039 --> 01:15:56.076
That puts me
and the rest of my guys at risk.

01:16:04.584 --> 01:16:06.086
That's not gonna happen.

01:18:15.614 --> 01:18:16.616
Franks!

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:19.619
You set these people up!

01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:21.655
That's right!

01:18:22.053 --> 01:18:23.289
It's called deception.

01:18:58.057 --> 01:18:58.959
Listen.

01:18:59.424 --> 01:19:00.427
We gotta get to Dad.

01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:24.984
Here it is, Franks!

01:19:35.428 --> 01:19:36.529
Come and get it!

01:21:12.725 --> 01:21:13.660
There you go.

01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:16.128
It's all yours.

01:21:18.364 --> 01:21:19.465
I heard the whole thing.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:22.634
Seven years you served.

01:21:23.369 --> 01:21:24.270
Good enough.

01:21:26.571 --> 01:21:28.273
We'll call that time served.

01:21:31.744 --> 01:21:34.280
This money cost me
my son's life.

01:21:36.414 --> 01:21:37.484
I'm sorry about that,

01:21:38.918 --> 01:21:40.820
but I'm sure it'll get you
where you wanna go.

01:21:43.655 --> 01:21:45.622
Where could I possibly go
I wouldn't be spending

01:21:45.624 --> 01:21:47.861
the rest of my life
looking over my shoulder?

01:21:50.262 --> 01:21:51.297
I'll take care of it.

01:21:53.831 --> 01:21:54.868
And my son?

01:21:57.703 --> 01:21:58.871
I'll take care of that too.

01:22:01.807 --> 01:22:03.209
Thank you, Detective.
