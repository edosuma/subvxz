(child)
<i>Angel of God, my guardian dear,</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:07.720
<i>to whom God's love</i>
<i>and trust me here</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:11.680
<i>ever this day be at my side,</i>

00:11.760 --> 00:16.360
<i>to light, to guard,</i>
<i>to rule and guide, amen.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:20.960
<i>I have homework to do.</i>
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

00:22.240 --> 00:23.680
<i>Dear God.</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:26.280
(indistinct chatter)

00:26.360 --> 00:31.400
(Rickie sobbing)

00:55.800 --> 00:58.400
(plays "Silent Night")

01:19.400 --> 01:20.440
It's not fair.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.280
Angela got a new bike
when she was 11.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.440
What do you do, keep like a running
tally of everything we buy for Angela?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.560
Well, yeah.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.200
Danielle,
we cannot afford that...

01:30.280 --> 01:34.320
-Oh, a Christmas card from the Lovettis?
-So?

01:34.400 --> 01:36.320
Well, I finally took them off the list.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.760
We haven't laid eyes on them
since Danielle started solids.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.680
And now out of nowhere
they send this?

01:40.760 --> 01:44.040
-It's a greeting card, not a dead fish.
-Yeah, but if I send a card now,

01:44.120 --> 01:48.160
it's gonna look like I'm only sending
them a card because they sent us a card.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.600
-Angela got new boots?
-Oh, Danielle, stop keeping score.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.560
Those are nice.
They must be warm.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.520
How come we never go to church?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.600
Uh, well...

01:58.680 --> 02:02.080
Well, you know, in the last few years,
you girls, um...

02:03.560 --> 02:07.560
-haven't shown much enthusiasm.
-So, do you believe in God?

02:09.760 --> 02:10.920
Well, look, just because...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.880
You know, just because we don't attend
church on a regular basis...

02:13.960 --> 02:16.560
Exactly. You can believe
in God without...

02:16.640 --> 02:20.960
Your father was raised catholic,
and I wasn't.

02:21.040 --> 02:26.400
So we have certain... certain differences,
which doesn't mean we don't...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.320
Do we have to keep talking
about religion?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.200
It's Christmas.

02:34.320 --> 02:40.480
<i>♪ Away in a manger</i>
<i>No crib for his bed ♪</i>

02:40.560 --> 02:43.520
<i>♪ The little Lord Jesus... ♪</i>

02:43.600 --> 02:46.320
People really get swept up
in this Christmas thing.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.640
You mean you don't?

02:47.720 --> 02:50.960
Yeah. But Mom and I like to wait
for the sales.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.320
Oh, my God!

02:52.400 --> 02:54.200
Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.600
I was running to catch the bus
and I slipped on this stupid patch of ice.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.880
All these people
had to like help me.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.920
It was stupid.
I was embarrassed.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.720
Whoa!

03:05.320 --> 03:07.240
So you landed on your face
or something?

03:07.320 --> 03:10.400
Oh, I don't know. How am I supposed
to know? Does anybody have quarters?

03:10.480 --> 03:12.800
I need to get a candy bar
before Soc.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.920
-It's cool. I got change.
-(coins jingle)

03:16.240 --> 03:17.760
Cool. See you later.

03:18.920 --> 03:22.320
Rayanne, do you think
that was true about falling?

03:23.080 --> 03:25.080
Sure. Probably.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.760
I don't know.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.440
Look, Angel Food, there's...

03:30.480 --> 03:34.840
See, Rickie has this,
like tendency to get beat up,

03:34.920 --> 03:37.040
and he doesn't always love
talking about it.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.520
-Teen Help Line.
-Yeah. What about it?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.280
I don't know. Just...

03:47.120 --> 03:49.280
making depressed people
talk to someone like you,

03:49.360 --> 03:52.040
couldn't that, like,
push them over the edge?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.320
Over the edge. That's, like, your address,
right?

03:57.400 --> 04:00.680
(laughs)

04:04.960 --> 04:07.240
(indistinct chatter)

04:12.520 --> 04:15.960
Krakow. Hey, here, take some of these.
So, we're set, right?

04:16.040 --> 04:19.680
Christmas eve, you and I representing
Liberty at the teen helpline?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.400
-Listen, Cherski, um...
-Krakow, you signed up.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.760
So, unsign me.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.760
You will not believe
what Bernice and Bob Krakow did.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.880
Oh, I know, but just that once, right,
to make Brian, huh?

04:37.600 --> 04:40.080
-They've skipped town.
-What?

04:40.160 --> 04:43.560
Seriously.
They're on some 10-day cruise.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.880
Bernice called me from the boat,
would I look in on Brian.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.280
Brian's a level-headed kid. He probably
likes having the place to himself.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.440
At Christmas?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.600
Well, the Krakows are Jewish,
aren't they?

04:53.680 --> 04:56.320
I mean didn't Hanukkah
already happen or something?

04:56.400 --> 04:57.640
Even so.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.920
Girls, we're going out
to purchase a few lumps of coal.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.880
I love the mall
this time of year.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.320
What do you want
for Christmas, shorty?

05:06.400 --> 05:11.880
(sighs) I want you to come with us
to church on Christmas eve.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.320
-You just think about it?
-Uh, church isn't for me.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.920
Come on, we should get going before all
that junk that nobody needs is snapped up.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.320
Wait, wait, look, I know that it
hasn't been a part of our lives,

05:23.400 --> 05:28.640
and it certainly isn't a part of the
girls, but the this is I want it to be.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.560
Then you should go.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.440
(soft music playing)

05:42.520 --> 05:44.120
(door opens)

05:50.120 --> 05:51.800
Who is it? Who's there?

05:55.640 --> 05:57.840
-It's okay.
-Oh, Rickie, what are you doing?

05:57.920 --> 06:00.360
I'm sorry. I... Did I scare you?

06:03.160 --> 06:04.720
No. I just...

06:08.480 --> 06:09.640
Come in.

06:10.240 --> 06:16.360
Uh, I was at, uh, Brian's.
So I just thought, you know, I'd stop by.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
(door closes)

06:17.520 --> 06:22.720
Today, at Rayanne's, uh,
Amber's boyfriend Rusty was there,

06:22.800 --> 06:24.520
boy, is he unfriendly.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.280
So you went from Rayanne's
to Brian's?

06:27.360 --> 06:31.080
Yeah, I just realized Amber
and Rusty both like earth tones.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.280
Isn't it kind of late at night
to like drop by?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.440
-Danielle!
-No, she's right.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.840
I should go now.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.400
God, your house smells,
like, amazing.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.200
My dad's teaching his cooking class now,
so he's trying out some recipes.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.400
Are you hungry or something?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.720
Mmm, thanks.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.400
I guess I forgot to eat lunch today.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.000
It must have slipped my mind
or something.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.200
Yeah. It happens
to me sometimes.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.160
(Patty) Who tracked these
wet footprints in the hall?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.200
Oh, Rickie's here.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.320
-Graham, look, Rickie's here.
-Clearly.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.000
He was visiting
Brian Krakow, so...

07:18.080 --> 07:20.680
Uh, my shoes are leaky.
I'll wipe it up. Sorry.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.880
It's no big deal. (chuckles)

07:22.960 --> 07:26.960
Sweetie, um, could we see you for
a minute? I need you to try something on.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.400
Look, it's no big deal, all right?

07:39.480 --> 07:42.240
Why don't you just tell us what's
going on? We'll decide if it's a big deal.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.720
-What happened? Was he in a fight?
-He says he fell.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.000
In any case, it's awfully late
to be having friends over.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.440
-I don't think he has anywhere to go.
-Did he say that?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.560
No. I just have this feeling.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.600
Look, sweetie,
if he's run away from home

07:56.680 --> 07:58.360
or if there's something
really wrong...

07:58.440 --> 07:59.720
(Patty) Maybe you should talk to him.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.320
No, that'll just freak him out worse.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.360
Can't he just stay here for one night?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.280
Honey, it's not our place.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.920
What if his parents
are expecting him? What if...

08:09.400 --> 08:11.560
Honey, having him stay here
is not the answer.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.040
Then what is the answer?

08:13.120 --> 08:14.520
(door closes)

08:14.600 --> 08:16.640
Oh, no! Rickie!

08:17.600 --> 08:20.120
(soft music playing)

08:28.960 --> 08:30.240
He's gone.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.760
Thanks.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.520
My old man used to knock me
around, too.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
He did?

09:49.800 --> 09:53.440
Hasn't done it in a couple
of years though. He's too scared.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.000
'Cause the last time...

09:58.080 --> 09:59.400
I threw a chair at him.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.920
Well, I'm going to light a candle
for you on Christmas eve.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.520
Oh, yeah?
You think that changes anything?

10:11.240 --> 10:12.840
-Uh-huh.

Were we wrong down there
about Rickie?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.560
(Graham) No, we weren't wrong.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.680
I mean, what do we really
know about that boy, you know?

10:53.480 --> 10:55.440
Uh, virtually nothing.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.880
We've never met his family.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.560
I mean, how on earth are we supposed
to know what the situation is?

11:00.640 --> 11:01.880
I know. You're right.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.800
Except, I think he does make you
kind of uncomfortable.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.920
What do you mean?
Because he wears makeup?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.680
Well, I'm just saying, you know...

11:13.600 --> 11:17.200
what if that was Brian Krakow
with that bruise on his face?

11:17.280 --> 11:19.960
Well, that'd be a different story,
wouldn't it?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.840
Graham, you can't compare them.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.240
I mean, I've known Brian Krakow
since he was 5 years old.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.960
I know. So have I.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.360
All I'm asking is,
should that make a difference?

11:32.240 --> 11:35.240
Well, maybe not, but it does.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
I know.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.280
(Rayanne) Angela, God, chill.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.600
Where is he?
Why isn't he at school?

11:49.680 --> 11:51.160
Maybe he's coming in late.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.720
Maybe he's at some
Sal Mineo Film Festival.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.000
I should have hidden him in my room.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.160
Stop acting so guilty.
He probably went to his cousins.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.600
He stays there sometimes.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.880
Angela, you can't, like, be responsible
for the whole world.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.320
What is this big thing
about Christmas?

12:12.400 --> 12:15.160
Everyone talks about it like
it's the second coming or something.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.880
Krakow, this is when people
need the helpline, okay?

12:18.960 --> 12:21.560
People get so stressed
over this holiday stuff...

12:21.640 --> 12:23.040
(locker clicks)

12:23.120 --> 12:26.720
they experience actual symptoms
of depression or whatever,

12:26.800 --> 12:29.320
like, total hopelessness
and despair.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.440
Oh, yeah? So what?

12:31.040 --> 12:31.920
What do I care?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.040
And like, loss of appetite,
or whatever. Christmas cookie?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.360
I'm not hungry.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.280
(slams locker)

12:39.360 --> 12:44.360
But I promised the supervisor, Brian.
You are the only one I can ask.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.800
It's Christmas eve.
People have, like, plans.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.600
Oh, except me, huh?

12:49.680 --> 12:52.840
I know, get Brian.
He never has any plans.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.000
Happy holidays.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.440
(sighs)

12:59.120 --> 13:02.640
(door opens and closes)

13:02.720 --> 13:04.720
(indistinct chatter)

13:04.800 --> 13:08.440
(sighs)
The damn Santa Claus pin broke.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.600
I'm just going to let that one go.
It's too easy.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.800
Brian Krakow completely
screwed me over.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.600
-Oh, really? How non-unusual. (laughs)
-Do you, like, know him?

13:17.680 --> 13:20.600
Not real well.
We slept together once.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.280
It's a joke, Cherski. Bubbles?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.120
(chuckles)

13:25.200 --> 13:29.920
I told the helpline two volunteers
from Liberty High on Christmas eve.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.320
How do I get myself
into these situations?

13:33.400 --> 13:34.560
Wild guess, stupidity?

13:34.640 --> 13:38.120
No. No, you're right.
Because I do it over and over again.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.280
I am, like, so overextended.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.000
Besides the helpline,
I have this holiday basket thing

13:44.080 --> 13:45.960
I said I'd make
for this nursing home.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.280
Plus, I have 2 million
presents to wrap,

13:48.360 --> 13:53.360
not to mention the 50,000 social events
I said I'd go to, and...

13:55.200 --> 13:57.480
I have to say, you're a pretty
good listener. (chuckles)

13:58.120 --> 13:59.440
Well, I should be.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.400
I spent my life listening to my mom
rag about her problems,

14:02.480 --> 14:04.600
of which she has, like, many.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.520
To top it off,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.600
she's got her low-life,
sex maniac boyfriend staying with us.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.680
It's gotten to the point
I just can't handle it.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.960
I'd just as well be somewhere else
for Christmas. (scoffs)

14:15.040 --> 14:16.520
Like they'd notice.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.720
I know where you could be
on Christmas.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.280
We're right over here.

-I was just leaving.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.000
'Cause of me?
I'm not supposed to be in here.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.960
Me, neither.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.080
I hang out here sometimes.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.880
It's funny.
Before, I'd never go to school.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.880
And now that I don't go to school,
I'm always here.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.080
What was that song?
That was... beautiful.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.040
It's just this song
I fool around with.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.720
I'll probably be
working on it forever.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.880
I hate to go back out there.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.160
I can never get warm.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.280
It's 'cause of my shoes.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.360
See, they're worn clean through.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.520
I had a decent pair,
but somebody swiped them.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.920
Seriously?

16:51.520 --> 16:53.000
While I was sleeping.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.920
You're Angela, right?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
You're a friend of Rickie's?

16:59.840 --> 17:01.880
-You know Rickie?
-Uh-huh.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.720
-Where is he? I've been really...
-I know.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.560
You don't have to worry.
I've been looking out for him.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.840
-(bell rings)
-Oh, thank God.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.960
Wait! You have to tell me
where Rickie is.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.160
(indistinct chatter)

17:26.920 --> 17:28.160
Oh, sorry.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.640
-Did you see that girl?
-What girl?

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
With the guitar.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.160
-What's her name?
-I don't know. She knows Rickie.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.560
-He still crashing at that place?
-What place?

17:39.640 --> 17:43.200
That old warehouse on Tennessee.
I brought him there.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.520
You brought him somewhere?

17:44.600 --> 17:46.760
Yeah, he was like,
"I'll light a candle for you."

17:46.840 --> 17:48.720
I'm like, "Don't waste your match."

17:51.240 --> 17:54.680
I know I shouldn't say stuff like that.
I didn't completely mean it.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.120
(mellow music playing)

17:59.760 --> 18:00.680
What? Do you miss him?

18:02.120 --> 18:05.160
-Come on, I'll bring you there.
-Oh, thanks.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.400
-(Graham) Hello? Can someone get the door?
-(knock on door)

18:20.640 --> 18:21.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.240
Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.680
Now, swing it around.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
(crash)

18:25.840 --> 18:27.200
Sorry. Sorry.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.080
Well, I didn't really like that anyway.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.920
Set it down. Got it? Good.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.920
-Anything else you need help with?
-I don't think so. Thanks.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.160
If I think of anything...

18:42.240 --> 18:45.360
-Oh, jeez.
-Oh! Hi. Hi.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.160
Where's Angela?

18:50.040 --> 18:52.880
(soft music playing)

18:59.840 --> 19:01.880

19:01.960 --> 19:03.880
Yeah. Yeah, here.

Hi, again.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.840
(mellow music playing)

22:00.520 --> 22:01.800
(Angela) Rickie?

22:04.280 --> 22:05.520
What are you doing here?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.440
Jordan brought me.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.400
-Rickie, are you okay? What happened?
-Nothing!

22:11.960 --> 22:13.680
Then why can't you go back home?

22:16.640 --> 22:17.800
Okay, come on.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.960
-What?
-I mean it. Come on.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.360
-You're staying at my house.
-I'm not sponging off your family!

22:21.440 --> 22:22.960
Shut up!
It wouldn't be like that.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.120
-Your parents don't want me around.
-That's not true.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.480
Rickie, please?

22:30.400 --> 22:35.040
Rickie, you can't be here. You can't.
Tomorrow's Christmas eve.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.200
You think I'd stay here
for Christmas?

22:37.280 --> 22:38.920
I'm going to my cousin's tomorrow.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.920
You... you'd better go home. They're going
to start wondering where you are.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.200
I mean, face it.
You don't belong here.

22:50.960 --> 22:55.080
-You don't belong here, either.
-I can't talk about this, not with you!

22:57.440 --> 22:59.680
If you want to help me,
leave me alone.

-(Patty) Angela, is that you?
-Uh, yeah.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.760
Wow. The tree looks...
really great.

24:50.840 --> 24:51.840
Hi.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.280
Hi.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.400
-We saved you the angel.
-Thanks.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.120
We waited as long as Danielle
could stand it, but...

25:02.200 --> 25:04.800
I know. I'm sorry.
I lost track of time.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.880
-Can I trim my room?
-Why not?

25:08.480 --> 25:11.640
So will you call next time, please,
if you're going to stay out this late?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.160
I know. I'm sorry.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.160
-Rickie's fine, by the way.
-Good.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.600
-I'll start dinner.
-I'll help.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.160
So, what was wrong with Rickie?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.600
Excuse me, but why are you here?

25:29.680 --> 25:32.800
Excuse me, your dad asked me
to help with the tree.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.480
So...

25:35.760 --> 25:37.280
seriously, is Rickie okay?

25:44.920 --> 25:47.800
If I tell you, will you promise
not to blab it to everyone?

25:49.400 --> 25:50.560
Yes.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.120
(Angela)
See, he never spelled it out,

25:53.200 --> 25:56.840
but I think his parents, like,
beat him up or something,

25:56.920 --> 26:00.000
because for some reason,
he's scared to go home.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.400
(Brian) Oh, my God.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.320
(Angela) You will not believe
where he's been sleeping.

26:05.800 --> 26:11.440
See, there's this place, this...
big, abandoned warehouse.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.200
Brian, it's so scary
and so strange.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.560
All these kids just like...
live there.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.040
What kids?

26:22.360 --> 26:23.920
Kids, Brian.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.840
There are kids who, like, have nowhere
to live. Don't you know that?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.840
You go to one abandoned warehouse,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.560
and suddenly you're this,
like, expert on homeless people?

26:31.640 --> 26:32.760
Shut up.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.200
It's just that... they're, like, normal.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.400
They're like us.

26:41.480 --> 26:45.120
Like there's this one girl,
and when you're talking to her, it's...

26:45.920 --> 26:47.360
it's like you forget that...

26:49.120 --> 26:50.320
you know.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
That there's any difference
between you.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.920
Is this that place on Roscoe
by the bowling alley?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.200
No. It's on Tennessee Avenue.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.800
-Oh, my God. Graham.
-Hey, just...

27:05.880 --> 27:08.480
That's where she was!

27:08.560 --> 27:10.960
Do you realize what could happen to her
in a place like that?

27:11.040 --> 27:12.480
Let's not panic.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.920
(scoffs) Well, maybe panicking
is the answer.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.880
You realize we can't ignore this.
We have to do something.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.520
We have to do the right thing.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.320
Who are you, Spike Lee?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.200
-Graham.
-Okay. Yeah. I know.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.160
We have to do the right thing.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.400
Dinner!

27:29.000 --> 27:33.280
Doughnut? Coffee?
Moonlit dinner for two?

27:33.360 --> 27:38.600
Uh, we'd like to report... a situation.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.600
Be my guest.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.400
See, our daughter
has a friend who is...

27:41.480 --> 27:44.480
Apparently living
in an abandoned warehouse...

27:44.560 --> 27:46.400
With some other kids.
So, of course...

27:46.480 --> 27:49.680
Of course.
Where did you say this place was?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.240
Tennessee Avenue.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.320
Oh, yeah. Tennessee.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.320
This is a good kid.
We're here because...

27:56.400 --> 27:59.040
Because we wanna,
you know, help.

27:59.640 --> 28:02.240
Yeah, and we thank you very much.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.400
Uh...

28:05.560 --> 28:06.760
was there something else?

28:09.440 --> 28:11.960
-Would you excuse us?
-Sure.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.760
-What are we doing?
-I don't know.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.640
Is this the right thing?

28:18.720 --> 28:23.560
Well, these are the people
who supposedly handle these situations.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.960
I don't know.
He seems like a decent man.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.360
He's fine. He's adorable.
It's just that we...

28:30.200 --> 28:31.880
What exactly will happen?

28:32.840 --> 28:36.760
Depends on the circumstances.
Is this kid a runaway or a throwaway?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.200
A throwaway?

28:38.280 --> 28:41.480
See,
a runaway leaves home of his own volition.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.920
A throwaway, a push out is...
pushed out.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.720
Oh, my God.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.320
Look, first off,
every effort is made to restore...

-Yes.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.480
-You keep her close, okay?
-Okay.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.280

I'm not finished.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.800
Sweetheart, it's beautiful!

30:02.400 --> 30:04.600
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.840
-Grandma and grandpa are in the mountains.
-I know.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.080
And Neil and Marla are with her parents
in Rockport, so...

30:10.160 --> 30:13.560
Mom, I know, listen, Mom,
I really want to do this, okay?

30:13.640 --> 30:16.560
-Please say it's okay.
-Say what's okay?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.920
I want to bring Rickie and that girl
over here for Christmas eve dinner.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.560
That's right.
I didn't even tell you about her.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.640
Mom, this girl has the most
amazing voice.

30:26.720 --> 30:27.720
-Wait till...
-Angela, listen.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.000
You cannot go back to that place.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.240
How do you know
about that place?

30:36.320 --> 30:39.800
-Sweetie, look...
-Don't, Mom.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.360
We had to do something.
We couldn't just...

30:44.000 --> 30:45.960
I can't believe this.
What did you do?

30:46.800 --> 30:51.600
Your father and I overheard you
and Brian talking, and...

30:51.680 --> 30:53.000
Oh, my God. You didn't...

30:53.520 --> 30:55.880
-you called the police or something?
-Angela...

30:55.960 --> 30:58.480
We have to do something,
warn them.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.120
Angela, listen to me.

31:00.200 --> 31:05.080
You are not going back to that place.
This is a serious matter.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.080
I know that!
Why do you speak to me like I'm a child?

31:08.160 --> 31:11.080
This girl, whoever she is,
has serious problems!

31:11.160 --> 31:14.360
You haven't even talked to her.
I've talked to her. This girl...

31:16.720 --> 31:21.320
-she could be me.
-Oh, don't say that! She couldn't be you.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.080
-How can you say that?
-Because it's true.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.160
Fine.
I'll put back the extra plates.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.480
(clatters)

31:46.760 --> 31:47.720
Hey, shorty.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.920
What is this with shorty?

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
Shoot!

31:52.280 --> 31:54.960
-Need help?
-No. No, I can do it myself.

31:55.920 --> 32:01.040
God, I just had...
the most upsetting fight with Angela.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.280
(sighs) You know, it was one of those
fights where it doesn't even seem real.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.680
It seems like the fight is having you.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.480
You'd better speak to her.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.720
Danielle said she went out for a walk.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.000
What was the fight about?

32:16.640 --> 32:17.720
Patty?

32:18.840 --> 32:20.000
Patty?

32:20.080 --> 32:22.440
(soft music playing)

32:25.920 --> 32:27.160
Rickie!

32:30.320 --> 32:34.440
(police) Hey, you, there.
Don't be scared. You're coming with us.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.400
-What was I thinking? What have I done?
-We were just trying to help.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.880
Will somebody tell me
what's going on for once?

32:52.960 --> 32:56.200
-I'll explain in a minute.
-Stay here in case she phones.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.000
Patty, it's okay.
She's going to come home.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.120
(door opens)

33:02.200 --> 33:04.880
Um, hi. I was just, you know,

33:04.960 --> 33:08.640
had... had nothing, like, planned,
so I, so...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.800
So what? Spit it out!

33:12.480 --> 33:15.080
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay! Go, go, go.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.760
-(door closes)
-She just... she's... in a hurry.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.400
Don't ask me. I just live here.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.320
(TV chatter)

33:29.400 --> 33:30.600
(man on TV) <i>Tell me.</i>

33:32.120 --> 33:35.120
<i>Are these the shadows</i>
<i>of the things that will be...</i>

33:36.000 --> 33:40.480
<i>or are they the shadows</i>
<i>of the things that may be only?</i>

33:43.320 --> 33:45.440
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge!</i>

33:52.360 --> 33:55.080
<i>Am I that man</i>
<i>who lay upon the bed?</i>

33:56.360 --> 33:57.960
<i>No, spirit! No!</i>

33:58.680 --> 34:00.520
<i>I'll not be the man I was.</i>

34:02.240 --> 34:03.520
And a Merry Christmas
to you, too.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.880
-Thanks for calling the helpline.
-(Rayanne sighs)

34:06.960 --> 34:09.360
-(phone ring)
-Oh, can I get this one? Please?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.720
Well... okay.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.640
But don't let the supervisor see you.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.040
Hello. Helpline.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.880
Hi. My name's Steve.

34:22.680 --> 34:23.920
Hi, Steve.

34:25.880 --> 34:29.280
-It's Brian Krakow!
-(chuckles)

34:29.360 --> 34:30.640
See...

34:31.760 --> 34:34.800
it's not like I enjoy spending time
with my parents or anything.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.840
So...

34:39.640 --> 34:41.680
when they first told me
they were going away...

34:43.040 --> 34:46.080
they asked me
if I wanted to go to Denver...

34:47.240 --> 34:49.440
to my sister and her husband's house.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.200
But...

34:54.760 --> 34:57.200
I said no, because...

34:57.960 --> 35:01.840
I thought, you know,
it'll be great. I'll...

35:03.280 --> 35:05.200
work on my PSATs.
It'll be, like...

35:07.960 --> 35:09.200
peaceful.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.280
But...

35:16.320 --> 35:17.320
I just...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.120
didn't expect
to feel this, like...

35:22.000 --> 35:23.160
lonely.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.680
Like even now,
I'm at my neighbor's, and...

35:34.200 --> 35:36.480
My God, he's like, crying.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.440
-Get out of town!
-My hand to God!

35:39.520 --> 35:41.920
Do you want me
to get the supervisor?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.040
No.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.560
No, I'll handle it.

35:47.800 --> 35:51.720
So, Steve,
you never asked me my name.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.280
What is your name?

35:58.880 --> 35:59.880
Jade.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.640
Jade? Do you go to liberty?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.440
-Negative, Steve.
-Thank God.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.280
So, Steve...

36:12.440 --> 36:13.640
what are you wearing?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.680
What?

36:16.280 --> 36:18.800
Um... right.

36:18.880 --> 36:24.920
My red flannel shirt
and my brown corduroys.

36:26.880 --> 36:27.760
Why?

36:28.400 --> 36:31.520
Would you like to know
what I'm wearing, Steve?

36:32.720 --> 36:35.360
Um... sure.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.480
I'm wearing a tank top.
It's really low cut.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.480
I'm practically popping out of it!

36:42.560 --> 36:48.400
<i>And these super tight shorty cutoffs.</i>
<i>Oh, they are so tight!</i>

36:48.480 --> 36:50.200
I better unzip them.

36:50.880 --> 36:56.000
Oh, mmm. That's so much better.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.320
Are you sure
this is the helpline?

37:01.400 --> 37:03.840
It's the helpline, all right.

37:04.480 --> 37:09.040
Mmm, it's getting
really warm in here. (gasps)

37:09.120 --> 37:11.040
I think I should
take off my tank top.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.200
Look, I better get off.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.600
I mean... hang up.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.720
I mean...

37:21.280 --> 37:22.680
I'm at my neighbor's, so...

37:22.760 --> 37:24.520
<i>Well, think of it this way, Steve.</i>

37:25.440 --> 37:27.280
You still feel like crying?

37:38.680 --> 37:42.960
-(bells jingle)
-(cars honking)

37:43.040 --> 37:47.000
(car door opens and closes)

37:51.400 --> 37:54.520
-Excuse me. Is this Tennessee Avenue?
-We're late.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.600
(soft music playing)

38:20.560 --> 38:23.600
(phone rings)

38:23.680 --> 38:25.720
-Hello?
-Is it her?

38:26.320 --> 38:27.920
-Angela?
-Dad.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.080
-Angela.
-Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.000
It's all right.
Just tell me where you are?

38:36.120 --> 38:39.320
Well, you're not going to believe this,
but I'm in the basement of this church.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.400
<i>They brought all the kids</i>
<i>from the warehouse here.</i>

38:41.480 --> 38:42.800
Just give me the address.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.400
Yeah, okay. I know where that's at.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.280
Right. All right. You stay there,
and we'll come get you.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.120
(slams telephone)

38:56.920 --> 38:58.160
We're going to church.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.240
Angela!

39:10.840 --> 39:13.280
Oh. Never mind.

39:15.680 --> 39:18.520
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm, uh...

39:19.560 --> 39:22.320
My daughter has boots just like those.

39:23.720 --> 39:26.760
You see, I'm trying to find my daughter,
and, um...

39:29.360 --> 39:30.360
I know.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.520
Because I'm no different from her.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.280
No. No, um...

39:37.360 --> 39:41.840
-You don't understand.
-Sure, I do. I had a mom.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.520
Clean sheets, all of that.

39:45.600 --> 39:50.560
Another toss of the dice, I could be
in her shoes, she could be in mine.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.080
There but for the grace of God.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.080
Go I.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.640
Go ahead. Ask me.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.960
Why did you leave home?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.720
My mother and I had a fight.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.720
The kind of fight where it seems like
the fight is having you.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.440
So, what else do you want to know?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.680
How did you die?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.400
I froze.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.600
Oh... God.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.880
Please help me.
