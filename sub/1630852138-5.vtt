00:25.640 --> 00:26.680
Shit!

00:36.440 --> 00:37.840
We need to warn the others.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.200
Come on.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.160
Bring him over here.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.840
What… Karen,
if Kasper and Liv aren't here,

01:41.920 --> 01:43.240
then where are they?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.040
Where could she be?

01:45.960 --> 01:46.840
I don't know.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.040
We're on an island!
How many places could they be?

01:51.080 --> 01:52.560
Or they're at the house. Let's go.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.400
We are going nowhere before daybreak.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.360
Why not?
What the hell is so dangerous out there?

01:59.640 --> 02:00.840
What is it?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.520
We need to find Kasper now.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.480
If he's with Liv,

02:05.560 --> 02:07.360
everything will be all right.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.640
She knows what to do.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.560
She knows what to do.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.680
Seriously, what is going on here?

02:22.720 --> 02:23.960
What happened to you?

02:29.040 --> 02:31.920
-What were you doing in there? Tell me!
-Karen.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.760
I told you to stay away.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.240
But you wouldn't listen.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.800
-Do you know what you've done?
-Karen.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.560
We need the fence back up
before they get out.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.120
Karen?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.360
What do we do?

02:49.400 --> 02:50.600
How can we help?

02:52.960 --> 02:55.080
You two grab the emergency generator.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.800
As soon as dawn breaks,
you power up that fence.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.560
And we'll go look for Liv and Kasper.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.720
What…

03:04.440 --> 03:06.320
What do you normally do when they get out?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.520
They've never escaped before.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.160
Why are we stopping?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.440
Liv, what's going on?

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
Quiet.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
They can hear us.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.120
-The engine's attracting them.
-What are you doing?

03:48.200 --> 03:51.040
-Where are you going?
-They're following us. Come on!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.040
I just wanted to save it.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.440
I didn't want it to be locked up.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.040
I just wanted to free it.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.120
I know, sweetheart.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.600
I know.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.680
Try to get some sleep, okay?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.160
We're too noisy.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.160
-Now what?
-Now we wait here until dawn.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.320
No!

05:02.320 --> 05:04.920
-We need to get away!
-Not until daybreak.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
We don't stand a chance in the dark.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.120
Grandma has it all under control.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.880
We just need to do what she says, and…

05:13.760 --> 05:15.080
then we'll be okay.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.960
There was no accident, right?

05:26.880 --> 05:28.360
They killed your parents.

05:28.880 --> 05:29.920
Didn't they?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.240
Why didn't you go?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.760
Why didn't you just leave?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.800
It's always been like this.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.160
And then what?

05:47.920 --> 05:50.360
-Do you take over from your grandma?
-Yes.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.680
That's how it goes.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.680
Is that what you want?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.040
To stay for the rest of your life?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.120
Come here.

06:09.920 --> 06:13.920
Body heat. We'll huddle up.
It'll be a cold night.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.280
I've got this.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.600
Stick to channel seven, okay?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.520
-And turn on the other one, sweetie.
-Sure.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.600
Yes.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.000
Put the box here.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.120
Move.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.160
I love you.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.520
So…

07:12.120 --> 07:14.400
It's okay, baby. We'll see you again soon.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.160
-Okay?
-Come on, baby.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.480
Let's find your brother.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.720
Off you go.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.800
Come on.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
Møller.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
I'm sorry about…

07:32.080 --> 07:33.560
what happened to your friend.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.400
Sweetheart.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.640
Come on, sweetheart.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.160
Isn't your grandma's farm that way?

08:04.520 --> 08:07.840
Yes, but we have to warn those
who live closest to the fence first.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.480
No, let's get some help.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.560
-Police, military--
-No, we fix it ourselves.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.400
Fix it…
Didn't you say they'd killed one of you?

08:15.480 --> 08:16.520
It was an accident.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.800
-But, Liv--
-You don't live here.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.920
You don't understand, okay?

08:25.800 --> 08:27.000
Then explain it to me.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.960
Liv.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.760
This is their place.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.360
They've always been here.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.560
Long before us.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.680
And they…

08:47.320 --> 08:48.960
They're bigger than we are.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.080
They're something more than we are.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.320
So this is sacred, Kasper.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.080
And that's why we're protecting it.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.440
It's our duty, you know?

09:11.440 --> 09:12.440
Let's go now.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.200
Will this work, Møller?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.240
Electricity's the only thing
holding them in.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.760
If they get out, they'll clear the island.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.320
What do you mean by "clear"?

09:34.520 --> 09:35.680
Clear it of what?

09:35.760 --> 09:36.800
Of us.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
All of us.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.880
Wait here.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.640
Kasper!

09:53.480 --> 09:54.680
Kasper!

09:55.560 --> 09:56.560
Kasper!

09:58.200 --> 09:59.200
Liv!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.280
Now what do we do?

10:05.880 --> 10:06.920
They're here.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.040
We have to hide.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.040
<i>Mads, it's me.</i>

10:17.400 --> 10:18.720
<i>Are you there?</i>

10:18.800 --> 10:19.680
<i>Mads?</i>

10:20.280 --> 10:21.120
Hello? Charlotte?

10:21.720 --> 10:22.800
<i>Charlotte, I'm here.</i>

10:22.880 --> 10:24.400
<i>-</i>Mads.
-<i>Are you okay?</i>

10:25.200 --> 10:26.400
We're hiding in the barn.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.160
Kasper's not here.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.760
-But the creatures are.
<i>-Charlotte?</i>

10:30.840 --> 10:33.480
-We need help.
-<i>Calm down, honey. We're hurrying.</i>

10:33.560 --> 10:34.880
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

10:34.960 --> 10:37.080
Yes. Hurry. Hur--

10:38.680 --> 10:40.360
-<i>Charlotte?</i>
<i>-</i>You're too noisy.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.440
-Jose, what's going on?
-Sorry.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.480
-What on earth for?
-It's all my fault.

10:49.560 --> 10:53.000
-I shouldn't have taken it.
-Don't say that. It's not your fault.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.440
Okay? You didn't do anything wrong.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.560
-Yes.
-No!

10:56.640 --> 10:59.160
-Yes.
-No! Listen to me now.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.520
Whatever happened and will happen
on this island, it's not your fault.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.360
It's not your fault.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.480
But it is.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.520
It is your fault.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.920
You took a baby and didn't give it back.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.000
We tried to fix it, but you just ran back.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.320
-Don't listen to her.
-People died because of you.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.480
Hey!

11:36.400 --> 11:39.160
In here! Now!

11:54.200 --> 11:56.080
Josefine, close the hatch.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.760
Møller.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.120
Get out and start the car.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.880
Now.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
Come on, Møller.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.600
Come on out, goddammit.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.680
Easy now.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.400
Come on.

13:34.920 --> 13:35.800
Come on, Møller.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.000
Mom!

14:45.880 --> 14:46.920
No!

15:17.800 --> 15:18.640
John!

15:19.320 --> 15:20.160
Lisbeth!

15:20.240 --> 15:22.040
-Liv.
-Are you there?

15:22.120 --> 15:23.840
They're not here. Let's just go.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.520
-We have to warn them.
-Liv.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
Let's just get away.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.760
What? I have to warn them.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.120
Liv.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.360
-Liv.
-Kasper…

16:16.480 --> 16:17.320
-No.
-Liv.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.680
I need you, okay?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.600
Liv, look at me.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.640
What do we do?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.760
My grandma has a radio at her office.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.280
-Okay.
-Let's use it to contact the mainland.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.280
-Okay.
-We have to get help.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.280
Yes.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.680
-Are they gone?
-I think so.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.480
They travel in packs.
If one's hurt, they stick together.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.320
Mads. Are you there?

17:07.520 --> 17:08.720
We need help.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.280
-They're after you.
-Mads, hello?

17:11.360 --> 17:12.200
What happened?

17:12.920 --> 17:16.680
At the lumber mill, you went to find
the baby, and then what happened?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.840
You haven't told us everything.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.840
I didn't…

17:24.520 --> 17:25.680
I didn't mean to.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.680
One of the big ones
climbed onto one of the saws…

17:31.000 --> 17:32.800
I accidentally switched it on.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.120
Answer me if you can hear me!

17:36.200 --> 17:37.320
Did you kill it?

17:48.440 --> 17:50.040
It's all my fault.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.320
Isn't it?

17:55.920 --> 17:56.920
Yes.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.680
Mads.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.280
Yes.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.160
But you can make it right again.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.000
-I can?
-Yes.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.520
Come on.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.760
Hang on! You're not going out there.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.960
They've retreated, but they'll be back.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.800
We'll wait here for help to arrive.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.280
No one's coming.

18:26.880 --> 18:27.920
Mads.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.960
We need help.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.720
But you can help us, Josefine.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.560
We need you.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.320
You're brave. You're strong.
The whole island needs you--

18:39.400 --> 18:41.640
-She's just a kid!
-No, I'm not.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.960
You always say that!

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
-Jose.
-I want to help.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.560
Jose, stop!

18:47.640 --> 18:49.600
-Let go.
-You're not going anywhere!

18:49.680 --> 18:52.080
-Let me go.
-You're not going anywhere!

18:52.160 --> 18:53.560
Do you understand?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.360
Sorry.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.640
Sorry, sweetheart.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.120
Come on.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.760
-Karen!
-Mom!

19:32.840 --> 19:33.680
Stop the car!

19:33.760 --> 19:35.800
-Karen.
-Mom!

19:35.880 --> 19:37.120
Mom!

19:37.200 --> 19:38.400
-Jose!
-Mom! Just stop!

19:38.480 --> 19:40.440
-Jose!
-Mom!

19:40.520 --> 19:41.720
Mom!

19:44.160 --> 19:45.200
Grandma?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.720
Grandma?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.400
Hello?

19:51.920 --> 19:54.320
Årmandsø calling mainland. Come in.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.560
Grandma?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.160
Årmandsø calling mainland. Come in.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.120
Who did that?

20:27.920 --> 20:28.880
She did.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.200
Your grandma?

20:31.640 --> 20:32.840
Why?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.200
Nobody leaves Årmandsø.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.680
Stop the car! My mom's coming.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.760
Stop, I said!

20:44.840 --> 20:47.440
-Be quiet!
-I'll jump out if you don't stop.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.600
-Stop it!
-No, stop the car!

20:54.560 --> 20:55.680
Who saved you in that barn?

20:56.280 --> 20:57.600
Her or me?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.720
-You did.
-And who do you think can fix this?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.280
Her or me?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.520
You.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.560
You're not a child, Josefine.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.000
I see both what you are and who you are.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.800
And what you can do.
You can do incredible things.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.160
You're a big girl now.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.120
When you're big, life has consequences.

Yes.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.360
