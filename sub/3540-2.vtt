00:04.069 --> 00:06.128
For over a century
I have lived in secret.

00:06.305 --> 00:09.502
Until now.
I know the risk, but I had no choice.

00:09.675 --> 00:10.699
I have to know her.

00:10.876 --> 00:12.537
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:12.778 --> 00:15.144
I know. We have history together.

00:15.347 --> 00:20.182
Last spring my parents' car
drove off of a bridge into the lake.

00:20.386 --> 00:22.217
You won't be sad forever, Elena.

00:22.421 --> 00:24.389
- I live with my uncle.
- Any siblings?

00:24.590 --> 00:26.990
- None that I talk to.
- Hello, brother.

00:27.192 --> 00:28.489
- Damon.
- Elena...

00:28.660 --> 00:31.595
...she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- But wherever you go, people die.

00:31.830 --> 00:32.888
My God, it's Vicki.

00:33.098 --> 00:35.362
Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

00:35.534 --> 00:37.297
Somebody help.

00:37.503 --> 00:38.697
Vampire.

00:38.904 --> 00:40.166
- Don't you crave?
- Stop it.

00:40.739 --> 00:43.367
Let's go for Elena.
Imagine what her blood tastes like.

00:43.542 --> 00:44.566
Stop.

00:47.312 --> 00:49.576
Stay away from Elena.

00:49.815 --> 00:51.806
I take that as an invitation.

01:05.764 --> 01:07.857
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:08.067 --> 01:09.398
I heard thunder.

01:09.601 --> 01:11.933
- There's no thunder.
- Are you sure?

01:12.137 --> 01:14.765
Because if it rains,
we won't be able to see the comet.

01:14.973 --> 01:16.099
It's not gonna rain.

01:17.476 --> 01:20.240
Listen, I got you a little something.

01:20.446 --> 01:22.437
It's back in the car.

01:22.614 --> 01:24.241
- Don't you move.
- Mm-mm.

01:31.423 --> 01:33.357
- Stay dry.
- It's not gonna rain.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.297
I knew it.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.877
I told you it was gonna rain.

02:30.682 --> 02:33.014
Open. No.

02:33.485 --> 02:35.009
Please.

03:03.215 --> 03:04.682
ELENA:
Dear diary:

03:05.484 --> 03:07.918
This morning is different.

03:08.086 --> 03:09.348
There's change.

03:09.521 --> 03:12.854
I can sense it. Feel it.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.515
I'm awake.

03:14.693 --> 03:16.661
For the first time in a long time...

03:16.862 --> 03:21.265
...I feel completely
and undeniably wide awake.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.469
For once,
I don't regret the day before it begins.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.104
I welcome the day.

03:27.272 --> 03:29.365
Because I know...

03:29.775 --> 03:31.140
...I will see her again.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.505
...I will see him again.

03:34.246 --> 03:39.411
For the first time in a long time,
I feel good.

03:43.021 --> 03:45.012
Hold on. Do I look adult?

03:45.224 --> 03:46.919
As in, respectfully parental?

03:47.125 --> 03:48.592
Depends where you're going.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.888
Jeremy's parent-teacher conference.

03:52.064 --> 03:54.225
Hair up or down?

03:54.433 --> 03:55.627
Sexy stewardess.

03:56.768 --> 03:59.896
- Boozy housewife.
- Up it is.

04:00.105 --> 04:02.573
- You're feisty today.
- I feel good.

04:02.774 --> 04:04.935
Which is rare,
so I've decided to go with it.

04:05.110 --> 04:08.773
Fly free.
Walk on sunshine and all that stuff.

04:08.947 --> 04:11.074
- Where is Jeremy?
- Oh, he left early.

04:11.250 --> 04:15.209
Something about getting
to woodshop early to finish a birdhouse?

04:17.389 --> 04:19.914
There is no woodshop, is there?

04:20.091 --> 04:21.649
- No.
- Yeah.

04:28.967 --> 04:32.232
You can't be in here, hon.
Visiting hours don't start till 9.

04:32.404 --> 04:35.237
I just... How is she?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.964
She's lost a lot of blood.

04:37.743 --> 04:39.608
Yeah, but she's gonna be okay, right?

04:40.779 --> 04:45.182
She needs her rest.
So you come back later. Come on.

04:47.286 --> 04:50.312
Originally discovered
nearly five centuries ago...

04:50.489 --> 04:54.550
...it hasn't been over Mystic Falls
in over a 145 years.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.092
Now, the comet will be its brightest...

04:57.262 --> 04:59.753
...right after dusk
during tomorrow's celebration.

04:59.965 --> 05:01.432
Are we bothering you?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.431
Mr. Salvatore?

05:04.703 --> 05:05.965
Miss Gilbert.

05:09.641 --> 05:10.938
I brought it.

05:11.576 --> 05:12.873
I told you.

05:13.078 --> 05:14.943
"Wuthering Heights by Ellis Bell."

05:15.113 --> 05:18.378
You know, I can't believe
she didn't use her real name.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.778
All the Bronte sisters
used pseudonyms.

05:20.952 --> 05:21.976
It was the time.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.554
Female writers
weren't very accepted then.

05:24.723 --> 05:26.816
Where did you get it?

05:27.626 --> 05:31.926
Uh... It was passed down
through the family.

05:32.097 --> 05:34.691
- Ah.
- I have lots of books. Go ahead.

05:34.866 --> 05:37.164
- Keep it.
- Oh, no, l...

05:37.903 --> 05:39.894
But I would like to read it again.

05:40.105 --> 05:41.868
I promise I'll give it back.

05:42.107 --> 05:43.131
Okay.

05:43.742 --> 05:46.905
I'm confused.
Are you psychic or clairvoyant?

05:47.112 --> 05:49.137
Technically, Grams says I'm a witch.

05:49.314 --> 05:52.579
My ancestors were these really cool
Salem witch chicks or something.

05:52.751 --> 05:56.243
Grams tried to explain it, but she was
looped on the liquor. I tuned out.

05:56.421 --> 05:59.185
Crazy family, yes.
Witches, I don't think so.

05:59.358 --> 06:03.021
Yeah, feel free to conjure up the name
and number of that guy from last night.

06:03.195 --> 06:05.561
I didn't see him. You did.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.255
Why didn't you just talk to him?

06:07.432 --> 06:09.696
I don't know. I was drunk.

06:20.045 --> 06:21.910
Hey, Tyler.
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.674
Just wondering how Vicki is,
since you guys are close.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.216
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.411
- Now get out of here.
- How bad is she?

06:29.588 --> 06:33.046
What attacked her? Is she gonna
recover? Was she happy to see you?

06:33.225 --> 06:35.591
- What room was she in?
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

06:35.761 --> 06:38.924
Yeah, you keep saying that, but when
are you gonna actually do it? Huh?

06:39.097 --> 06:41.657
Because I vote for right here
right now.

06:43.468 --> 06:46.266
Walk away, Gilbert.
It's your final warning.

06:46.471 --> 06:49.736
This is your final warning.
I'm sick of watching you play Vicki.

06:49.908 --> 06:54.072
If you hurt her one more time,
I swear to God I will kill you.

06:55.947 --> 06:58.643
Damn, that was like a death threat.
Did you hear that?

06:58.817 --> 07:02.810
They're keeping her overnight, but she
should be able to come home tomorrow.

07:02.988 --> 07:04.649
- That's good news.
- Yeah.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.723
Did you get in touch with your mom?

07:06.892 --> 07:08.382
Called and left a message.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.051
She's in Virginia Beach
with her boyfriend.

07:11.229 --> 07:14.221
So we'll see how long
it takes her to come rushing home.

07:14.966 --> 07:16.991
- Vicki's lucky that she's okay.
- I know.

07:17.202 --> 07:19.830
And now there's talk
of some missing campers.

07:20.005 --> 07:23.065
Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

07:23.275 --> 07:26.108
- She said it was a vampire.
- What?

07:26.278 --> 07:30.146
Yeah, she wakes up last night,
mutters, "Vampire," and passes out.

07:30.315 --> 07:33.807
- Okay, that's weird.
- Think she was drunk.

07:34.953 --> 07:37.478
So, what's up with you
and the new guy?

07:41.426 --> 07:44.520
Matt,
the last thing I wanna do is hurt you.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.692
You know, I'm actually
gonna go back to the hospital.

07:47.866 --> 07:52.303
I wanna be there when Vicki wakes up,
get the real story about last night.

07:53.271 --> 07:54.602
Okay.

08:05.851 --> 08:08.251
As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned.

08:08.453 --> 08:12.446
All right, it's the third day of school,
and he's skipped six of his classes.

08:12.624 --> 08:17.789
Mr. Tanner, are you aware
that Jeremy and Elena's parents died?

08:17.996 --> 08:20.556
Four months ago, a great loss.
Car accident.

08:20.765 --> 08:22.892
Wickery Bridge,
if I remember correctly.

08:23.068 --> 08:26.970
And you're related to the family how?
The mother's kid sister.

08:27.506 --> 08:30.873
- Younger sister. Yes.
- Right.

08:32.043 --> 08:35.171
Six classes? Are you sure?
I mean, that's kind of hard to do.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.308
Not when you're on drugs.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.677
It's his attempt at coping,
Miss Sommers.

08:40.852 --> 08:45.812
And the signs are there. He's moody,
withdrawn, argumentative, hung-over.

08:46.391 --> 08:49.087
Are there any other relatives
in the picture?

08:49.828 --> 08:53.127
- I'm their sole guardian.
- Uh-huh.

08:53.331 --> 08:55.026
Could there be?

08:58.069 --> 08:59.832
What are you suggesting exactly?

09:01.339 --> 09:04.866
It's an impossible job, isn't it?
Raising two teens.

09:06.845 --> 09:10.337
It's been tough, but no. It's not.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.709
Wrong answer.

09:12.317 --> 09:14.547
It is an extremely impossible job...

09:14.753 --> 09:17.722
...and anything less
and you're not doing it properly.

09:45.984 --> 09:47.246
Whoa.

09:47.652 --> 09:50.143
Vick. Vicki, hey.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.654
Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?

09:52.857 --> 09:54.848
- No! No!
- Hey. Vicki. Vicki.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.290
- No! No!
- It's me, Vicki. Stop.

09:57.495 --> 10:01.625
- No! No!
- Nurse.

10:01.866 --> 10:05.165
It was an animal. It came out
of the night and jumped you.

10:05.403 --> 10:07.633
You blacked out.
That's all you remember.

10:07.872 --> 10:10.568
- That's all I remember.
- Animal attack. You blacked out.

10:10.742 --> 10:13.108
- That's all you remember.
- That's all I remember.

10:13.812 --> 10:16.110
Nurse, I need help. It's my sister.

10:19.684 --> 10:21.151
She seems fine.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.337
I was talking to Grams.

11:19.511 --> 11:21.706
She said the comet
is a sign of impeding doom.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.781
Last time it passed over Mystic Falls,
there was lots of death.

11:24.949 --> 11:28.350
So much blood and carnage,
it created a bed of paranormal activity.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.920
Mm. Yeah, and then you poured
Grams another shot...

11:31.089 --> 11:33.455
...and she told you about the aliens.

11:33.658 --> 11:35.057
So then what?

11:35.226 --> 11:36.250
So then, nothing.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.861
You and Stefan talked all night.

11:39.030 --> 11:43.091
There was no sloppy first kiss,
or touchy-feely of any kind?

11:43.268 --> 11:46.032
- Nope, we didn't go there.
- Not even a handshake?

11:46.237 --> 11:50.503
I mean, Elena, we are your friends.
Okay? You are supposed to share the smut.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.235
- We just talked for hours.
- What is with the blockage?

11:53.411 --> 11:55.879
Just jump his bones already.
Okay, it's easy.

11:56.081 --> 12:00.108
Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, sex.

12:00.351 --> 12:02.376
- Profound.
- Mm.

12:06.991 --> 12:09.289
- Where are you going?
- Caroline's right.

12:09.527 --> 12:13.156
It is easy. If I sit here long enough,
I'll end up talking myself out of it...

12:13.331 --> 12:17.199
...instead of doing what I started
the day saying I was gonna do.

12:19.571 --> 12:20.595
I picked up dinner.

12:20.772 --> 12:22.706
Tacos. Had an urge for guacamole.

12:22.874 --> 12:24.705
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Eat anyway.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.071
It's a ruse. I wanna talk.

12:28.413 --> 12:31.712
Hey, you. Come. Sit.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.923
Back at school. Freshman year.

12:41.126 --> 12:44.960
I could eat my weight in nachos.
With extra cheese.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.098
It was my food
whenever I got stoned.

12:47.298 --> 12:49.289
You get high?

12:49.467 --> 12:51.162
Did. Past tense.

12:52.303 --> 12:54.100
But, yeah. Loved it.

12:54.272 --> 12:58.140
Anything to get a little
distraction from life. Reality.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.909
And it works. For a while.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.105
Never lasts though.

13:04.282 --> 13:07.149
I'm not saying I wouldn't
love to rail back and kick it...

13:07.318 --> 13:10.549
...but with a thesis looming
and a waistline expanding...

13:20.999 --> 13:23.194
- What the...?
- Finally, you're awake.

13:24.102 --> 13:25.660
Hey, how are you feeling?

13:26.805 --> 13:27.999
You look better.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.198
I was worried before.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.969
You really had me freaked out
with all that screaming.

13:33.144 --> 13:35.339
Wait, what are you talking about?

13:35.513 --> 13:36.707
You don't remember?

13:38.683 --> 13:40.651
I feel fine.

13:42.654 --> 13:45.145
Good. Good.

13:45.323 --> 13:48.121
The doctor said you could
come home tomorrow.

13:51.095 --> 13:53.029
Vick, what attacked you
in the woods?

13:56.301 --> 13:57.791
An animal.

13:58.336 --> 14:01.032
What else could it have been?

14:01.873 --> 14:03.636
Hey, how do you feel?

14:05.476 --> 14:06.807
I'm okay.

14:08.746 --> 14:12.648
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

14:12.817 --> 14:15.217
Hey, Jer.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.717
Why are you here?

14:17.322 --> 14:18.983
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

14:19.157 --> 14:22.251
Did you see that look on Matt's face?
That was suspicion.

14:22.427 --> 14:25.055
I don't want people
to find out about us, Jeremy.

14:25.263 --> 14:28.426
- You gotta get over that.
- Tyler is finally showing some interest.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.658
You have to get over that too.

14:30.835 --> 14:34.100
Do you see Mr. Concern?

14:34.272 --> 14:36.433
Tyler? Are you under there?

14:36.641 --> 14:38.336
No.

14:38.509 --> 14:41.535
It's not cool for people to know,
okay?

14:42.413 --> 14:46.076
I'm older than you,
and Matt and Elena would freak.

14:46.251 --> 14:49.049
No one's gonna suspect anything.
Why wouldn't I check on you?

14:49.220 --> 14:51.381
I'm the one who found you.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.020
- You are?
- Yeah.

14:53.224 --> 14:55.522
I carried you out of the woods.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.595
Thank you.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.296
Yeah, you're welcome.

15:31.229 --> 15:33.220
Stefan?

15:40.138 --> 15:42.231
Stefan?

16:15.173 --> 16:16.538
I'm sorry for barging in.

16:16.774 --> 16:18.401
The door was...

16:19.077 --> 16:20.806
...open.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.376
You must be Elena.

16:26.117 --> 16:27.675
I'm Damon. Stefan's brother.

16:27.852 --> 16:29.649
He didn't tell me he had a brother.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.515
Well, Stefan's not one to brag.

16:31.689 --> 16:33.657
Please. Come.

16:34.158 --> 16:36.683
I'm sure Stefan
will be along any second.

16:38.663 --> 16:41.154
Wow. This is your living room?

16:41.366 --> 16:45.166
Living room, parlor,
Sotheby's auction.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.565
It's a little kitschy for my taste.

16:49.073 --> 16:50.904
I see why my brother's so smitten.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.675
It's about time.

16:53.878 --> 16:56.244
I never thought he'd get over
the last one.

16:56.414 --> 16:58.541
Nearly destroyed him.

16:59.183 --> 17:00.514
The last one?

17:00.685 --> 17:03.381
Yeah. Katherine. His girlfriend?

17:05.823 --> 17:09.486
Oh, you two haven't had
the awkward exes conversation yet.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.093
Nope.

17:11.295 --> 17:13.229
Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now.

17:14.665 --> 17:18.795
Maybe he didn't tell you because he didn't
want you to think he was on the rebound.

17:20.505 --> 17:24.202
We all know
how those relationships end.

17:24.375 --> 17:27.435
You say it like every relationship
is doomed to end.

17:28.246 --> 17:30.111
I'm a fatalist.

17:31.015 --> 17:32.039
Hello, Stefan.

17:34.018 --> 17:37.010
Elena.
I didn't know you were coming over.

17:37.221 --> 17:39.519
- I know, I should have called...
- Oh. Don't be silly.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.318
You're welcome any time.
Isn't she, Stefan?

17:43.728 --> 17:46.720
I should break out the family
photo albums or some home movies.

17:46.898 --> 17:49.492
But I have to warn you...

17:49.667 --> 17:51.259
...he wasn't always such a looker.

17:51.436 --> 17:54.963
Thank you for stopping by, Elena.
It was nice to see you.

17:57.708 --> 18:00.700
Yeah, I should probably go.

18:00.878 --> 18:03.073
It was nice to meet you, Damon.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.944
Great meeting you too, Elena.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.622
Stefan?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.218
Stefan?

18:31.576 --> 18:35.808
Great gal. Whew. She's got spunk.

18:37.882 --> 18:39.679
You, on the other hand, look pooped.

18:41.419 --> 18:43.319
Did you overexert yourself today?

18:43.521 --> 18:46.183
Let me guess. Hospital.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.255
Someone had to clean up your mess.

18:48.426 --> 18:52.021
Well, were you successful?
Did the powers of persuasion work?

18:52.263 --> 18:55.289
If you don't feed properly,
none of those tricks work right.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.663
- How long was Elena here?
- Are you worried, Stefan?

18:58.836 --> 19:02.272
Scared we may be doomed
to repeat the past?

19:02.940 --> 19:05.738
Isn't that why you play your game,
I'm a High School Human?

19:05.910 --> 19:08.640
- I'm not playing any game.
- Of course you are.

19:09.514 --> 19:12.142
We both know the closest
you'll ever get to humanity...

19:12.316 --> 19:14.341
...is when you rip it open
and feed on it.

19:14.519 --> 19:18.046
What kind of game
are you playing, Damon?

19:19.457 --> 19:22.426
Guess you'll just have
to wait and see, won't you?

19:27.231 --> 19:30.826
He's on the rebound
and has raging family issues.

19:31.035 --> 19:32.866
Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend.

19:33.037 --> 19:35.130
Wait till you date a guy
with mommy issues.

19:35.306 --> 19:38.867
Or cheating issues.
Or amphetamine issues.

19:40.711 --> 19:42.679
Jeremy.

19:45.449 --> 19:48.646
Jeremy, where were you?

19:49.353 --> 19:50.479
More stoner stories?

19:50.655 --> 19:52.646
Look, Jenna, I get it.
You were cool once.

19:52.823 --> 19:55.587
And that's cool.

19:55.826 --> 19:58.021
Oh, no, no, no.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.993
Ow. Why? Why did you do that?

20:00.164 --> 20:02.598
Listen up.
Quick ditching class, or you're grounded.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.564
No discussion.

20:04.735 --> 20:07.101
Parental authority. I like it.

20:07.271 --> 20:09.034
Sleep tight.

20:55.586 --> 20:56.917
Matt.

20:59.824 --> 21:01.655
Matty?

21:24.682 --> 21:26.343
Night of the Comet.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.575
Would you like a program?

21:30.454 --> 21:32.615
He didn't call, huh?

21:32.790 --> 21:33.916
Or text.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.458
We never even exchanged that stuff.
We never got to the texting part.

21:37.628 --> 21:40.859
- That's an important milestone.
- Isn't it?

21:41.065 --> 21:42.965
The timing was wrong anyway.

21:43.134 --> 21:45.932
- When is it ever right?
- I'm not ready, Bonnie.

21:46.103 --> 21:47.570
Who is?

21:49.106 --> 21:53.372
- At least I put myself out there.
- Is that what you're calling it?

21:54.111 --> 21:55.840
What do you mean?

21:56.013 --> 21:59.073
All I'm hearing
is reasons why you can't.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.348
What is Damon doing here
Why did he come home?

22:32.516 --> 22:36.008
I came home. He wants to make
my life miserable. It's how he enjoys his.

22:36.187 --> 22:39.213
He's putting us at risk.
This girl in the hospital could talk.

22:39.390 --> 22:40.982
She won't.

22:41.158 --> 22:43.388
- I took care of her.
- You're sure?

22:45.463 --> 22:47.021
I'm not sure, Zach.

22:47.231 --> 22:50.530
I don't know how well it worked.
I'm not as strong as Damon.

22:50.701 --> 22:52.999
- What happens if it doesn't work?
- I don't know.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.936
- I'll deal with it.
- Is she worth it, Uncle Stefan?

22:57.174 --> 22:59.404
This girl you came back for?

23:04.582 --> 23:05.742
What are you doing here?

23:05.916 --> 23:08.111
Fighting with Robert
about my schedule.

23:08.285 --> 23:11.254
You'd think getting ripped up
would merit an extra sick day.

23:11.422 --> 23:13.913
- Well, you feeling okay?
- I hurt, right?

23:14.158 --> 23:18.026
- The doctor gave you something right?
- The kid stuff. Nothing with an O in it.

23:18.763 --> 23:20.788
I think they were onto me.

23:21.031 --> 23:23.864
Here, knock yourself out. Literally.

23:25.269 --> 23:27.430
Thanks, Jer.

23:28.305 --> 23:30.865
So you gonna watch the comet later?

23:32.042 --> 23:34.033
I hadn't really thought about it.

23:34.211 --> 23:36.475
But I could be talked into it.

23:37.281 --> 23:39.806
- I'll meet you out there in a few.
- Hey, Vick.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.579
- How you feeling?
- Like you care.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.486
What are you looking at, Gilbert?

23:57.201 --> 24:01.570
- Hey, I got you a candle.
- Hi. Thanks.

24:02.006 --> 24:03.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:05.276 --> 24:07.141
Thank you.

24:07.344 --> 24:09.209
You're welcome.

24:18.022 --> 24:19.717
Thank you.

24:21.725 --> 24:23.420
Hi.

24:23.594 --> 24:24.618
Hi.

24:48.319 --> 24:50.378
You know, that comet...

24:50.988 --> 24:54.515
...it's been traveling across space
for thousands of years.

24:55.759 --> 24:57.192
All alone.

24:57.361 --> 25:01.559
Yeah, Bonnie says
it's a harbinger of evil.

25:02.533 --> 25:07.129
I think it's just a ball
of snow and ice...

25:07.338 --> 25:10.068
...trapped on a path
that it can't escape.

25:10.841 --> 25:14.504
Once every 145 years,
it gets to come home.

25:18.282 --> 25:21.183
I'm sorry about yesterday.

25:21.352 --> 25:23.479
I wasn't myself.

25:24.989 --> 25:28.652
You seem to spend
a lot of time apologizing.

25:28.826 --> 25:31.886
Well, I have a lot to apologize for.

25:33.430 --> 25:36.763
Yesterday, that wasn't about you, okay?

25:36.934 --> 25:39.562
You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

25:41.205 --> 25:45.505
We're not close. It's complicated.

25:45.676 --> 25:47.405
Always.

25:50.347 --> 25:54.579
He told me about your ex. Katherine?

25:57.922 --> 25:59.549
What did he say?

25:59.757 --> 26:01.850
That she broke your heart.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.060
That was a long time ago.

26:10.968 --> 26:13.266
When you lose someone,
it stays with you.

26:13.437 --> 26:16.065
Always reminding you
of how easy it is to get hurt.

26:23.948 --> 26:24.972
Elena.

26:25.215 --> 26:28.810
It's okay, Stefan. I get it.

26:28.986 --> 26:31.386
You have no idea how much I get it.

26:31.589 --> 26:34.353
Complicated brother? Check.

26:34.558 --> 26:36.287
Complicated ex? Check.

26:36.460 --> 26:39.429
Too complicated to even contemplate
dating? Double check.

26:40.364 --> 26:42.229
It's okay.

26:42.399 --> 26:46.062
We met, and we talked,
and it was epic...

26:46.236 --> 26:51.765
...but then the sun came up
and reality set in.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.280
So...

27:19.269 --> 27:20.293
I know you.

27:22.806 --> 27:24.967
Well, that's unfortunate.

27:25.809 --> 27:27.174
Uh...

27:27.911 --> 27:33.406
I don't know how, but your face...

27:38.155 --> 27:40.146
Excuse me. Sorry.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.270
Hey, has anyone seen Vicki?

27:59.443 --> 28:01.877
- You're her stalker. You tell us.
- I can't find her.

28:02.046 --> 28:03.877
Probably found someone to party with.

28:04.048 --> 28:07.313
- Sorry, pill pusher, you've been replaced.
- "Pill pusher"?

28:07.518 --> 28:09.782
- Ask him.
- You wanna do this right now?

28:09.953 --> 28:12.251
- Are you dealing?
- She's never gonna go for you.

28:12.756 --> 28:15.691
She already did.
Over and over and over again.

28:15.893 --> 28:18.726
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, you slept with Vicki Donovan?

28:18.962 --> 28:21.726
I mean, Vicki Donovan slept with you?

28:21.965 --> 28:25.560
- There's no way.
- I didn't even have to force her into it.

28:25.736 --> 28:28.899
- What is he talking about?
- Nothing, man. Ignore him. He's a punk.

28:29.106 --> 28:32.564
- Shut up and help me find my sister.
- We'll check the bathroom.

28:32.743 --> 28:34.904
- I'll check the square.
- I'll come with you.

28:35.079 --> 28:39.015
Oh, no, no, no.
You are coming with me.

28:39.183 --> 28:41.344
So that's your game now? Dealing?

28:41.518 --> 28:44.453
- No, I'm not dealing.
- I'm sick of the tough-love speech, Jer.

28:44.621 --> 28:47.647
- It's clearly having no impact.
- You and Jenna, between the two...

28:47.825 --> 28:51.727
We could stop. Send you to a therapist
where you'll be forced to deal with it.

28:51.929 --> 28:54.625
Or to rehab where you'll sit
and tell some stranger...

28:54.798 --> 28:57.358
...how you let your life fall apart.

28:57.534 --> 28:59.900
Or you could talk to me.

29:01.105 --> 29:02.538
I vote for none of the above.

29:08.612 --> 29:10.307
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:10.514 --> 29:12.414
Have you seen my sister?

29:12.583 --> 29:15.711
- No, sorry.
- Can't find her. She's missing.

29:17.421 --> 29:19.719
I'll keep an eye out for her.

29:19.890 --> 29:23.018
Hey, I saw you
at the hospital yesterday.

29:26.463 --> 29:27.521
Did you?

29:28.265 --> 29:30.062
What were you doing there?

29:32.436 --> 29:34.563
Visiting.

29:34.738 --> 29:36.535
Visiting?

29:39.076 --> 29:42.568
You know, Elena and I,
we've known each other a long time.

29:43.113 --> 29:48.016
And we might not be together right now,
but I look out for her.

29:48.185 --> 29:50.050
And I'll always look out for her.

29:52.189 --> 29:54.589
- No! No, please.
- You really have to stop screaming.

29:54.758 --> 29:58.285
- Stop. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.
- Shh. I've got you.

29:59.163 --> 30:00.960
Excuse me.

30:06.203 --> 30:07.534
- Would you like?
- No!

30:07.704 --> 30:10.867
- No. Please don't.
- I got you. I'm not gonna drop you.

30:15.145 --> 30:16.635
Not bad.

30:16.814 --> 30:19.305
- Have you been eating bunnies?
- Let her go.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.213
Really? Okay.

30:22.386 --> 30:23.580
- No! No!
- No, no, no.

30:25.022 --> 30:26.353
Relax.

30:27.124 --> 30:28.148
What's happening?

30:28.325 --> 30:31.658
I don't need her to be dead,
but you might.

30:36.333 --> 30:38.233
What attacked you the other night?

30:40.804 --> 30:43.364
I don't know. An animal.

30:43.607 --> 30:44.835
Are you sure about that?

30:45.375 --> 30:47.206
Think. Think about it.

30:47.377 --> 30:49.538
Think really hard.

30:51.715 --> 30:53.808
What attacked you?

30:55.719 --> 30:57.550
Vampire.

30:58.322 --> 31:00.347
- Who did this to you?
- You did.

31:00.557 --> 31:02.218
- Wrong. Stefan.
- Don't.

31:02.426 --> 31:04.053
Don't.

31:09.199 --> 31:11.429
Stefan Salvatore did this to you.

31:11.668 --> 31:13.499
Stefan Salvatore did this to me.

31:13.704 --> 31:15.399
He's a vampire.

31:15.572 --> 31:17.597
A vicious, murderous monster.

31:17.774 --> 31:19.674
Please, Damon. Please don't do this.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.837
You couldn't fix it before.

31:22.012 --> 31:24.503
I don't know
what you're gonna do now.

31:30.254 --> 31:31.881
Aah!

31:32.222 --> 31:34.713
Your choice of lifestyle...

31:34.925 --> 31:36.950
...has made you weak.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.390
Couple of vampire parlor tricks...

31:39.563 --> 31:42.964
...is nothing compared
to the power that you could have.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.861
That you now need.

31:46.603 --> 31:48.730
But you can change that.

31:48.939 --> 31:51.203
Human blood gives you that.

31:52.309 --> 31:54.072
No.

31:56.747 --> 31:58.544
You have two choices.

31:58.715 --> 32:01.548
You can feed and make her forget...

32:03.053 --> 32:06.386
...or you can let her run screaming,
"Vampire!" through the town square.

32:06.556 --> 32:08.114
That's what this is about?

32:08.292 --> 32:09.987
You wanna expose me?

32:10.727 --> 32:12.661
No, I want you
to remember who you are.

32:12.829 --> 32:16.959
Why? So, what?
So I'll feed? So I'll kill?

32:17.134 --> 32:20.831
So I'll remember what it's like
to be brothers again?

32:21.805 --> 32:23.500
You know what? Let her go.

32:23.707 --> 32:27.609
Let her tell everyone that vampires
have returned to Mystic Falls.

32:27.811 --> 32:30.006
Let them chain me up.

32:30.247 --> 32:32.772
And let them drive
a stake through my heart.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.646
Because at least I'll be free of you.

32:44.528 --> 32:47.520
- Wow. Come here, sweetheart.
- No.

32:47.731 --> 32:49.722
It's okay.

33:08.452 --> 33:09.783
What happened?

33:11.254 --> 33:12.949
Where am I?

33:13.790 --> 33:17.021
I ripped my stitches open. Ugh.

33:17.627 --> 33:21.393
- You okay?
- I took some pills, man.

33:21.565 --> 33:23.260
I'm good.

33:27.671 --> 33:29.138
It's good to be home.

33:29.806 --> 33:31.068
Think I might stay a while.

33:32.576 --> 33:35.477
This town could use a bit
of a wakeup call, don't you think?

33:35.645 --> 33:38.307
What are you up to, Damon?

33:38.515 --> 33:43.316
That's for me to know
and for you to dot, dot, dot.

33:44.187 --> 33:46.280
Give Elena my best.

34:01.071 --> 34:03.005
She said you found her
wandering around.

34:04.708 --> 34:05.732
Yeah.

34:05.909 --> 34:08.536
So, um, thanks.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.375
Ugh. Just so much drama.

34:15.685 --> 34:18.916
Ever notice how the druggies
are the biggest attention whores?

34:19.121 --> 34:20.521
Yeah.

34:20.724 --> 34:22.954
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

34:23.126 --> 34:26.322
- Have you guys seen Elena?
- I think she went home.

34:28.931 --> 34:33.197
I'm gonna give you Elena's
cell number and her e-mail.

34:33.370 --> 34:39.239
She is big on texting,
and you can tell her I said so.

34:39.443 --> 34:40.534
Thank you.

34:46.116 --> 34:47.947
You okay?

34:48.952 --> 34:50.418
What happened to you?

34:53.456 --> 34:54.889
That was so rude.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.890
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

34:58.061 --> 35:01.997
Yeah, she kind of wigs out.
It's like her thing.

35:07.137 --> 35:08.161
Jer?

35:08.371 --> 35:10.999
No, it's me. The hypocrite patrol.

35:11.174 --> 35:13.165
What are you doing?

35:13.977 --> 35:16.002
I've become my worst nightmare.

35:16.179 --> 35:21.845
The authority figure who has
to violate a 15-year-old's privacy.

35:22.018 --> 35:23.280
Jackpot.

35:23.453 --> 35:26.445
I see the hiding places
haven't gotten any more creative.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.456
What brought this on?

35:29.659 --> 35:33.288
Your ass-hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday.

35:33.463 --> 35:35.931
You got Tannered. Been there.

35:36.933 --> 35:40.027
"Discover the impossible, Miss Sommers."
Got it. Thanks.

35:40.203 --> 35:42.433
Like I didn't know I was screwing up.

35:42.606 --> 35:44.335
You're not screwing up, Aunt Jenna.

35:44.508 --> 35:47.102
Yes, I am. You know why?

35:47.277 --> 35:49.939
Because I'm not her.

35:50.113 --> 35:51.978
She made everything look so easy.

35:52.149 --> 35:55.209
You know,
high school, marriage, having you.

35:58.555 --> 36:00.455
I can't do it.

36:00.624 --> 36:02.387
I'm gonna say
or do the wrong thing...

36:02.559 --> 36:05.926
...and he's gonna get worse,
and it's gonna be my fault.

36:13.637 --> 36:15.229
It's impossible.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.033
This is just the fear talking.

36:20.443 --> 36:23.571
You're a little scared, that's all.

36:26.249 --> 36:28.183
We all are.

36:33.757 --> 36:35.588
I have to go do something.

36:37.260 --> 36:39.728
But are you gonna be okay?

38:01.111 --> 38:03.477
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

38:05.348 --> 38:08.317
No, it's fine.

38:08.485 --> 38:10.112
I was hoping I'd see you again.

38:10.954 --> 38:12.080
I know.

38:14.257 --> 38:15.781
Cocky much?

38:16.660 --> 38:18.560
Very much.

38:21.665 --> 38:23.530
BELL RINGING]

38:29.973 --> 38:31.634
Hey.

38:36.813 --> 38:38.508
Would you like to come in?

38:40.383 --> 38:42.715
The comet's actually this way.

38:57.634 --> 38:58.965
Sorry for barging in.

38:59.736 --> 39:01.135
Especially after earlier.

39:01.304 --> 39:03.966
No, no. I'm glad you're here.

39:04.140 --> 39:08.201
The way we left things, I didn't like it.

39:10.246 --> 39:16.412
So the thing is, I got home tonight
planning on doing what I always do.

39:16.619 --> 39:18.678
Write in my diary.

39:18.888 --> 39:22.187
Like I have been since my mom
gave me one when I was 10.

39:22.392 --> 39:24.053
It's where I get everything out.

39:24.227 --> 39:27.924
It all goes in this little book
that I hide on the second shelf...

39:28.164 --> 39:31.156
...behind this really
hideous ceramic mermaid.

39:31.935 --> 39:37.168
But then I realized that I'd just be writing
things that I should be telling you.

39:39.275 --> 39:40.572
What would you write?

39:44.147 --> 39:46.411
I would write:

39:47.584 --> 39:53.682
"Dear diary, today I convinced
myself that it's okay to give up.

39:53.857 --> 39:55.085
Don't take risks.

39:55.258 --> 39:59.422
Stick with the status quo, no drama.
Now is just not the time."

40:01.264 --> 40:04.233
But my reasons aren't reasons,
they're excuses.

40:04.401 --> 40:06.801
All I'm doing is hiding from the truth.

40:06.970 --> 40:09.165
And the truth is that...

40:11.541 --> 40:13.270
...l'm scared, Stefan.

40:14.377 --> 40:19.815
I'm scared that if I let myself
be happy for even one moment...

40:19.983 --> 40:23.214
...that the world's
just gonna come crashing down...

40:23.386 --> 40:26.082
...and I don't know
if I can survive that.

40:28.425 --> 40:32.225
Do you wanna know
what I would write?

40:35.231 --> 40:37.222
"I met a girl.

40:38.635 --> 40:40.000
We talked.

40:41.504 --> 40:43.438
It was epic.

40:44.774 --> 40:48.232
Then the sun came up
and reality set in."

40:51.648 --> 40:53.741
Well, this is reality.

40:55.351 --> 40:57.148
Right here.
