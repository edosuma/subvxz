we were having a
deep conversation
after my last fight,

06:52.368 --> 06:54.239

life's tryna teach me.

Well, I know you've been
too busy to go on a real date,

09:11.072 --> 09:14.641
so I wanted to set up a

of Queen of the Ring.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.666
Mm hmm?

09:39.709 --> 09:40.971
Apparently, your
opponent had to drop out.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.407
She broke her hand
during training.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.670
- Ouch
- So this is your

09:43.713 --> 09:44.932
new opponent now.

Lola.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.766
I'm the best.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.594
The only reason Lola is champion

09:54.637 --> 09:55.551
is cause she hasn't met me yet.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.466
Lola ain't shit.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.033
Well, that should
be interesting.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.904
She walked outta
frame and everything.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.951
Felt like I was watching a
pro wrestling match.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.517
So extra.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.303
Hey babe, look, you
should take this seriously.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.435
This could be a huge
opportunity for you.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.090
Hold up. Wait.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.876
What?

10:15.919 --> 10:16.703
Babe?

10:19.270 --> 10:21.185
What? Like I
can't call you that?

10:22.143 --> 10:23.492
Well, you can call me Lola.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.538
Okay.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.628
I see this is gonna
be a challenge.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.066
And you thought I
was gonna be easy?

10:32.109 --> 10:33.545
Whoa. Lola, no.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.678
Whoa, that's not
what I'm saying.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.506
Then what are you saying?

10:37.549 --> 10:40.465
I'm just saying
it's, I'm, it's, I'm

10:40.509 --> 10:42.293

you're easy in any way.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.695
That's why, what David?

10:55.176 --> 10:57.004
That's why I want
us to be together.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.006
What?

10:59.049 --> 11:00.485
Yeah.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.140
I love you, Lola Williams.
I have for some time now.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.316
I don't want that to
be a one night thing.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.059
Great.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.671
The one time I want you
to say something back,

11:11.714 --> 11:13.324
you say nothing.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.548
Is everything okay?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.727
Everything's fine. I just

11:28.470 --> 11:29.863
You just, what?

11:29.906 --> 11:32.648
I feel like I
wanna knock you out.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.519
What?

11:34.563 --> 11:36.521
What, what are you,
what are you doing?

11:36.565 --> 11:37.740
You wanna take our relationship

11:37.784 --> 11:38.959
- What? I'm just
- to the, that level?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.743
Hey, hey, look, I
had to shoot my shot.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.965
I don't know about
this stage right now.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.662
What do you mean
you don't know?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.186
Look, you know, I'm trying
to roll with the punches

11:49.230 --> 11:51.188
and take us to the next round.

11:51.232 --> 11:55.584
Oh, stop. Stop.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.500
I was barking on that.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.806
Did you practice that?

11:59.849 --> 12:01.721
- I did. I did. I did.
- Oh my god.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.026
You like leaned in with it

12:03.070 --> 12:04.332
and you
I did, I was decked out

12:04.375 --> 12:05.768
I was in lean.
Uh

12:05.812 --> 12:09.903
No.
No? Okay.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.862
Oh, wow.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.823
So, I'm willing to give
this a try if you are.

12:19.477 --> 12:22.567
I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.048
It's okay.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.490
I ain't going nowhere.

12:36.059 --> 12:36.843
Okay.

12:39.149 --> 12:39.933
Okay.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.717
All right.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.852
- I mean, you got a candle
- I did.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.506
- in the summertime.
- I did. I did.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.247
Were we supposed
to light this thing?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.727
I don't know. I don't.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.903
I just threw it in there
with the rest of the stuff.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.580
- Lola.
- Whoa. Hey

13:18.623 --> 13:19.973
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

13:20.016 --> 13:21.583
Yeah, you good?

13:21.626 --> 13:23.324
Yeah, I'm good, just
working on the next fight.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.629
You know how that go.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.935
But I wanted to let you know

13:25.979 --> 13:28.068
that you motivated me
to continue to fight.

13:28.111 --> 13:32.812
My mother, she died of breast
cancer a couple years ago.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.727
And, but she fought
all the way to the end.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.860
I've honestly never seen anybody

13:37.904 --> 13:39.775
fight like my mother fought.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.474
And that reminded me of you.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.434
I mean, I just want you to
keep doing what you're doing,

13:46.477 --> 13:48.828
because you're out here
motivating people like me.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.830
And you don't even
know it sometimes.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.180
I, yeah, you're right.
I didn't.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.791
So I just wanted to let
you know I'm watching,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.924
and the whole world
is watching you.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.664
Keep it up.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.015
Thank you, man.
I appreciate it.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.931
And hey, you looking
good, you know?

14:04.974 --> 14:05.975
All right, you guys.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.716
I've brought y'all to the gym

14:07.759 --> 14:09.892
because I know y'all
like boxing, right?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.415
You like boxing, right?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.721
All right.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.244
And you gonna know
of the finger cells

14:14.288 --> 14:16.203
in three different
elements, okay?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.596
So this girl will show
you self defense, okay?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.337
Show you how to protect yourself

14:20.381 --> 14:21.817
and everything
that you do, right?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.038
Wait, is that Lola?

14:28.563 --> 14:29.433
Hi!

14:34.438 --> 14:37.702
Oh my god, thank
you guys so much!

14:37.746 --> 14:40.227
Wow. What a greeting!

14:40.270 --> 14:41.358
Nice to meet you.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.620
Nice to meet you, too.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.710
Oh, we doing

14:45.754 --> 14:47.887
Thank you guys for coming.

14:47.930 --> 14:48.975
Thanks for having us.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.628
- Wow. Y'all look beautiful.
- Wow.

14:50.672 --> 14:51.934
You are beautiful.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.588
Aw, thank you.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.895
I mean, you don't all look
quite dressed for boxing.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.897
Oh, we
can go. We can go.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.465
Okay, ladies, so
Miss Lola has took time

15:01.509 --> 15:03.859
outta her schedule today to
come and hear your stories.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.252
So, let's share.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.472
My name is Jessica.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.865
Hi, Jessica.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.127
Hi.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.824
Lola, Jessica wants
to be a boxer also.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.609
Oh, okay.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.958
Why do you wanna be a boxer?

15:16.002 --> 15:16.959
To defend myself.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.963
Why do you feel like you
need to defend yourself?

15:21.007 --> 15:23.748
From men who abused
me in the past.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.926
Friends of my dad
that he worked for,

15:26.969 --> 15:28.449
they would threaten me
that they'll fire him

15:28.492 --> 15:29.972
if I don't do what they say.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.106
And that I'll lose my home
and end up on the street.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.934
I'm so sorry to hear that.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.937
Hi, I'm Michelle.

15:38.938 --> 15:43.725
Lola, because of you,
I got outta depression.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.902
And also because of you,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.513
now I know that I'm enough.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.995
Lola, meeting you today

15:53.039 --> 15:55.258
has made me realize
anything is possible.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.609
Thank you.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.047
Watching you throughout the
years has really inspired me

16:01.090 --> 16:02.744
to take my power back.

16:02.787 --> 16:06.791
Because when I was a little
girl, my dad used to molest me,

16:06.835 --> 16:10.621
and it made me
feel so worthless,

16:10.665 --> 16:12.493
and so scared all the time.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.888
But I'm not scared
anymore because of you.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.195
So, thank you.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.894
Lola, this is
my daughter, Lisa.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.375
She's so inspired by you.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.594
Lisa, don't be shy.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.465
Tell her how you feel.
Stop it, mom.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.249
Okay, mom.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.815
Come on, Lisa.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.948
All right. Hi.

16:34.950 --> 16:38.084
You inspire me to
go for my dreams.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.002
You motivate me to be
the best that I can be.

16:44.829 --> 16:45.613
Wow.

16:47.441 --> 16:51.053
Thank you guys, for really
sharing your stories.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.013
It takes a lot of courage
to come to a group like this

16:54.056 --> 16:55.275
and speak your truth.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.191
It takes a lot of power within

16:58.234 --> 17:01.020
to stand here in front of
others and share like that.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.067
I didn't know how to handle the
feelings that I was feeling,

17:05.936 --> 17:07.461
and I too was abused.

17:08.505 --> 17:12.857
It made me feel powerless.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.859
Like I didn't know how to
communicate or tell anyone

17:15.904 --> 17:17.992
what I was going through,
because I wasn't like you.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.082
I didn't have the courage.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.390
I was not the Lola that you
see here with you right now.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.914
My life was spiraling
out of control.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.523
I was out with
friends all the time,

17:27.568 --> 17:30.005
I was drinking,
I had no purpose.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.269
And one day, went to this
club, and all of a sudden,

17:33.313 --> 17:36.620
this guy came behind me
into the ladies' room,

17:38.100 --> 17:39.145
and he caught me off
guard, and he attacked me.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.103
And I didn't know what to do.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.063
I didn't know how
to defend myself.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.762
I didn't have the tools.
I wasn't equipped.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.024
He overpowered me.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.897
That stays with me every day.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.030
So how do you cope with it?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.990
That's a great
question, Jessica.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.123
Boxing.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.214
Boxing saved my life,

18:06.824 --> 18:09.131
because it made
me feel empowered.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.351
It made me feel strong.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.962
It made me feel like
I can do anything.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.095
It made me fearless.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.489
It's because I've worked on
me. I feel like a champion.

18:20.751 --> 18:24.581
That's how I was able
to overcome all of it.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.887
That's what I want you guys

18:25.930 --> 18:27.671
to take away from this
session here today.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.587
I'm so proud of each of you.

18:32.241 --> 18:35.114
I'm proud because you have the
courage that I didn't have.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.072
So, if you're looking at
me and I'm looking at you,

18:37.116 --> 18:39.727
I'm like, you're starting
off better than me.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.685
So, I expect you to
be better than me.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.471
Everybody say, "I'm a champion."

18:44.514 --> 18:46.081
I'm a champion.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.952
Ah. Say it like you
mean it. "I'm a champion."

18:47.996 --> 18:49.258
I'm a champion!

18:49.302 --> 18:51.608
Say, "I am enough."

18:51.652 --> 18:52.392
I'm enough!

18:52.435 --> 18:55.264
That's right. You are.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.918
You are enough.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.093
Do you believe that?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.181
Yes.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.228
Okay, I'm sorry. I know.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.012
Y'all got me in here crying.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.754
This was not a part of the plan.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.147
Bring it in, bring
it in. Bring it in.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.368
One, two.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.456
One, two.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.370
There we go. There we go.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.197
Move. Move.

19:15.241 --> 19:15.980
Gimme that four again.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.243
That four?

19:17.286 --> 19:18.505
The one, two, four,
or just the four?

19:18.548 --> 19:19.245
Let's work on
the one, two, four.

19:19.288 --> 19:20.855
All right, let's go.

19:22.204 --> 19:22.987
One more time.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.860
There we go. There we go.
All right.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.122
Come on, Lola. Come on.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.254
Tag him, let's get it.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.951
Come on, head
movement, foot movement,

19:29.994 --> 19:31.082
let's get it in.
Come on, let's go.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.562
You punch, head movement,

19:32.606 --> 19:33.824
slide away.
Slap for me.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.043
Come on, slap for me.
Let's get it in.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.131
Four.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.567
Circle left,
one, two, one, two.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.831
Yeah.
One, two. One, two.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.050
Ah, no, Lola.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.225
Lola, what are you doing?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.531
She needs to move that head!

19:44.574 --> 19:47.186
No, she needs to
move those feet.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.146
What have I been drilling
since I've been here?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.018
Move your feet,
move your feet, move your feet.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.324
Move your feet. Move your feet.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.935
Do I look like I'm laughing?

19:57.979 --> 20:00.329
The fight is tomorrow night.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.244
Stop.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.028
No, cause you asked for my help.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.421
I didn't ask for yours.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.206
Okay.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.515
And you two, go on over there
and do it like I showed you.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.474
Yes, ma'am.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.519
Yes, ma'am.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.131
You two, come closer.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.220
Yes, ma'am.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.441
Y'all supposed to be the best.

20:25.485 --> 20:26.268
- Definitely.
- We the best.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.835
Then act like it.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.926
You can't play with
them, either of them.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.582
Look, they need you,
especially David.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.888
And I got my own family,

20:37.932 --> 20:40.587
my own responsibilities
I gotta handle.

20:40.630 --> 20:41.892
Yeah.

20:41.936 --> 20:45.287
For y'all, you two
gonna be here every day.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.202
We hear you.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.247
I hope so.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.553
- We got you, Sash.
- We got you.

20:50.597 --> 20:51.511
- All right.
- Got you.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.903
Now let's just win this fight!

20:52.947 --> 20:54.209
All right.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.254
Let's do this. Let's
do this. Let's go.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.211
- Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

21:03.784 --> 21:08.136
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's go time.

21:09.746 --> 21:14.316
Introducing first, the
challenger in the black corner,

21:14.360 --> 21:16.100
from Brooklyn, New York,

21:16.144 --> 21:18.146
12 wins by KO,

21:18.189 --> 21:20.191
I present to you,

21:20.235 --> 21:23.064
Trina 'Doomsday' Jackson.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.548
And in the red corner,

21:28.591 --> 21:31.594
with an equally
impressive amateur record

21:31.638 --> 21:35.250
of five wins by KO, zero losses,

21:35.294 --> 21:39.036
the reigning, defending
Queen of the Ring,

21:39.080 --> 21:42.170
Lola Williams.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.276
You hit like a bitch.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.238
Stop running, fight me.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.551
Come on,
Lola. You got this.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.205
Fight!

22:20.034 --> 22:22.558
Come on, change
numbers on her.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.084
No more holding.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.129
She was on me, ref.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.916
Fight!

22:39.183 --> 22:41.272
You weak. I smell
blood all over you.

23:10.911 --> 23:11.433
Back, back, back.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.567
One, two, three.

23:14.610 --> 23:15.698
Out. Out. Out.

23:15.742 --> 23:16.873
Medic. Medic. Medic.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.010
Lola, sit up and
breathe. Breathe, Lola.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.448
Good. Breathe. Breathe in.

23:29.799 --> 23:34.195
And the winner by knockout,
the new Queen of the Ring,

23:34.238 --> 23:36.719
Trina 'Doomsday' Jackso

23:36.763 --> 23:39.461
Yay!

23:39.505 --> 23:40.941
Yes.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.682
I'm the champ. This is my belt.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.336
I knew I could do it.
I'm so happy right now.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.816
Yes.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.340
Yes, honey. And whose,
whose, whose ass did you whoop?

23:49.384 --> 23:51.473
Lola who? I'm the champ now.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.344
It's about Trina.
It's Trina's time.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.435
And nobody's gonna win
this belt back from me.

23:56.478 --> 24:00.264
Amen. Can we say the
champ is here, what?

24:04.355 --> 24:07.750
Doc. How's my baby girl?

24:07.794 --> 24:09.056
She's stable.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.927
She suffered a bit of
tinnitus, nothing major.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.799
Tinnitus? What's that?

24:12.842 --> 24:14.670
She explained that
she's a boxer, correct?

24:14.714 --> 24:16.280
Mm hmm.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.196
Well, she took quite a
few tough blows to the head.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.461
Tinnitus is not really a
condition, but a symptom.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.027
So many things could
have gone wrong.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.290
She really should not have
been fighting while pregnant.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.944
Pregnant?

24:27.988 --> 24:29.293
You didn't know.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.469
They don't know.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.906
How?

24:32.949 --> 24:34.603
Can we see her, please?

24:34.647 --> 24:37.301
Yes, but she specifically
asked to see David first.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.128
Is he here?

24:39.739 --> 24:40.522
That's me, doc.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.263
Please come with me.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.873
Everyone, wait here momentarily.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.355
Well, I'll be damned.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.358
This some bullshit.
Uh-uh.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.534
John, not right now.
Come on, let's just wait.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.404
Let's wait.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.495
Wait.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.201
Hey.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.379
I can't believe
I lost my title.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.163
That's the least of
your worries right now.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.513
Your health is what matters.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.038
Least of my worries?
David, I lost my belt.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.779
You'll get another shot, Lola.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.651
Your health comes first.
Just one step at a time.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.436
I was supposed to go pro
after that fight. You know that.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.439
Well, that's gonna have to
be on pause for right now.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.051
The doc told me you're pregnant.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.967
Why didn't you say anything?

25:34.010 --> 25:37.492
I'm just as surprised
as you are. Me, pregnant?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.842
I would've never thought in a
million years I'd be pregnant.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.409
I asked him about aborting it.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.542
Without consulting me?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.414
Oh, David, it's my body. I
get to do it what I please.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.331
You know, you can't
be this selfish, Lola.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.333
It's my child, too.

25:52.376 --> 25:56.380
David, you know I can't
have a baby right now.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.036
Where are you going?

26:01.516 --> 26:02.822
You know what?

26:02.865 --> 26:05.564
Why do you insist on
doing selfish things, huh?

26:06.521 --> 26:08.958
This is serious,
Lola. I'm serious.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.656
I'm serious about you, about us.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.573
This is not a game.
I am not a game.

26:15.922 --> 26:19.534
I don't know your past, but
if you'd just let me in,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.492
you will see that I
would die for you.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.453
Ever since the moment I met you,

26:25.496 --> 26:27.542
I knew that you
were the one for me.

26:29.022 --> 26:29.762
David.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.415
I love you, Lola.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.461
I love you.

26:37.073 --> 26:37.857
Lola.

26:39.162 --> 26:39.946
Do you love me?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.606
I mean, you know I've
always been attracted to you.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.781
We've kind of had this

26:48.824 --> 26:50.521
Lola, just answer
the damn question.

26:56.919 --> 26:57.746
Yes. I

26:57.790 --> 26:58.660
You do?

26:58.704 --> 27:00.923
Yes, I love you. You already

27:00.967 --> 27:01.707
Yes

27:01.750 --> 27:03.491
Okay. Okay.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.363
Okay. Okay.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.241
Oh my. Oh, what, what are
you, what are you doing?

27:14.284 --> 27:16.765
Well, I, I was, I was gonna
wait until after the fight,

27:16.809 --> 27:20.551
but, you know, well, it's
no time like the present.

27:22.902 --> 27:25.121
Lola. Lola Williams.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.297
Will you marry me?

27:28.603 --> 27:29.691
Are you serious?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.824
Yes, I'm serious.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.521
I'm doing this
because I love you.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.523
You really do.

27:35.566 --> 27:39.962
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Always.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.834
Okay. Ask me again.

27:41.877 --> 27:42.661
Okay.

27:44.314 --> 27:45.576
Lola Williams,

27:48.057 --> 27:49.668
will you be my wife?

27:51.626 --> 27:52.366
Yes?

27:52.409 --> 27:53.149
Yeah.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.237
Yes?

27:54.281 --> 27:55.978
Yeah. I will.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.632
Yes.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.415
Yes.
Oh my

28:01.680 --> 28:03.290
Oh, I love you.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.517
Yeah, girl. She fell for
everything I baited her with,

28:13.561 --> 28:14.693
the jab, the uppercut.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.216
I'm like, "Damn."

28:16.259 --> 28:17.565
But you know what?

28:17.608 --> 28:19.610
I think it took me too
long to knock her out.

28:19.654 --> 28:20.873
Next time I fight her,

28:20.916 --> 28:22.396
I'ma knock her out
in the first round.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.528
They gonna call me
the knockout queen.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.313
Yo. Yo, you Trina.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.010
You one that knocked out
Lola like it was nothing.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.316
Oh, you's a fan.

28:29.359 --> 28:30.752
Let's get you, let's
get you a picture.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.319
I know what you want.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.624
I don't know, man.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.843
I heard she was pregnant.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.758
If she wasn't, Trina
would've got them hands.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.673
You know what I'm saying?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.587
Don't say that.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.067
That's what they sayin'.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.938
What are you talking
about? Who told you that lie?

28:42.982 --> 28:45.549
Everybody know.
It's on social media.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.769
Social media don't know shit.

28:47.813 --> 28:50.685
Trina 'Doomsday', the
greatest woman boxer ever.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.642
Don't ever disrespect me.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.556
You got it.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.167
I ain't got time today, sucker.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.647
Knock yo ass out.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.823
Damn.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.694
Yo.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.312
Supposed to be the
happiest day of my life.

29:14.013 --> 29:14.796
We have
come together today

29:14.840 --> 29:16.711
for this joyous occasion

29:16.755 --> 29:19.714
for Lola Williams
and David Morehouse

29:19.758 --> 29:23.022
to join themselves together
on this special, special day.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.198
And the bride and
the groom have chosen

29:25.241 --> 29:26.808
to say their own vows.

29:26.852 --> 29:27.635
Lola.

29:30.638 --> 29:33.554
David Morehouse, thank you.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.818
It's because of you that
I know what love is.

29:38.385 --> 29:41.649
I've never felt love like this
until you came into my life.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.695
You've created such
a safe space for me

29:44.739 --> 29:46.697
to be able to fall
in love with you.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.266
I really cherish what we have.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.357
And I vow to honor you, to
always be there for you,

29:54.401 --> 29:57.883
to support you, and to always
have your back no matter what.

30:01.843 --> 30:02.713
Lola Williams,

30:04.977 --> 30:09.982
I vow to love, and
cherish and honor,

30:10.852 --> 30:12.898
protect, and always be there,

30:12.941 --> 30:15.988
no matter what
adversity we face.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.859
From the moment I saw you,

30:18.773 --> 30:21.210
that fighting spirit
that you have,

30:21.254 --> 30:23.038
I was drawn to you.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.474
You are my heart, queen.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.565
And I'm going to love
you from dusk until dawn.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.699
Always. I love you.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.440
I love you, too.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.530
Can we
have the rings, please?

30:39.707 --> 30:40.882
With this ring,

30:41.796 --> 30:42.841
With this ring.

30:42.884 --> 30:43.972
I be we'd.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.365
I be we'd.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.714
In the
name of the father.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.671
in the
name of the father.

30:47.715 --> 30:48.847
And the son.

30:48.890 --> 30:49.891
And the son.

30:49.935 --> 30:50.892
And
the Holy Ghost.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.502
And the Holy Ghost.

30:52.546 --> 30:56.289
Wow, by the
power that is invested in me,

30:57.551 --> 30:59.988
we now pronounce you
husband and wife.

31:00.032 --> 31:03.949
You may kiss your bride.

31:07.735 --> 31:10.216
Ladies and
gentlemen, I now present to you,

31:10.259 --> 31:13.828
Mr. And Mrs. David Morehouse.

31:23.272 --> 31:27.407
♪ My world has come together

31:28.843 --> 31:32.542
♪ And maybe I just
wanna let it shine ♪

31:32.586 --> 31:35.197
Attention,
attention, everyone.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.633
Today is

31:36.677 --> 31:37.417
Attention.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.766
Yes.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.377
Today is my
sister's biggest day.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.683
Mm hmm.

31:42.726 --> 31:43.727
My sister is one of
the most beautiful woman

31:43.771 --> 31:45.381
that I've ever seen.

31:45.425 --> 31:48.689
And not a lot of people can
handle you. Cheers, David.

31:50.734 --> 31:54.738
She is so strong and has
a fire like no other.

31:56.044 --> 31:59.569
And ladies, not a lot of men
can handle that type of heat.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.528
So, I love you so much.

32:01.571 --> 32:04.835
David, I'm glad to
call you my brother.

32:04.879 --> 32:07.621
And I can't wait to see
the future with you two.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.971
Welcome to the
family, and cheers.

32:10.015 --> 32:10.798
Cheers.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.540
Oh, I love you too.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.241
Yes, yes. Cheers
to this bitch.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.156
Are y'all serious?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.984
All of y'all are just sitting
here, standing around,

32:23.028 --> 32:24.551
looking at the
newly formed Lola.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.295
Damn, I guess the rumor is true.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.427
You are pretty knocked up.

32:33.386 --> 32:36.215
I'm a little offended, Lola.
No invite to your wedding?

32:36.258 --> 32:38.086
People going around saying
that I won the fight

32:38.130 --> 32:39.783
was because you was pregnant.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.176
Let's show the world
you ain't nothing

32:41.220 --> 32:43.396
but a punk ass bitch
who play boxing.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.486
I'm offering you to rematch.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.619
Soon as you drop that baby,
meet me inside the ring.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.360
Any time, any place.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.709
Little girl, you done chose

32:52.753 --> 32:54.233
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

32:54.276 --> 32:57.584
About to get an ass whooping
of a different kind. Uh-huh.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.194
Get your ass outta here
Oh. Mr. Wyman West.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.935
before we throw you out.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.416
Mr. Trainer,
former champion.

33:03.459 --> 33:04.808
See, I did my research on you.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.288
Mm hmm. You better know it.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.942
I respect my elders.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.379
But the next time you put
your finger in my face,

33:10.423 --> 33:12.033
I'll knock your old ass out.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.035

33:16.995 --> 33:18.126
Gonna risk the baby, please.

33:18.170 --> 33:21.564
Yeah, I'll leave, but
I'll be waiting on you.

33:21.608 --> 33:22.652
Man, I'm going

33:22.696 --> 33:24.002
- Baby, no.
- I'm not gonna let her

33:24.045 --> 33:24.741
ruin our special day.
Okay. Lola, please.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.047
I'm gonna knock her out.

33:26.091 --> 33:26.917
- I'll leave you with a little
- Get the fuck

33:26.961 --> 33:28.223

33:29.920 --> 33:31.052

33:32.358 --> 33:34.925
I bet your ass'll come
fight me now, won't you?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.976
Proud time, proud
time, ready to shine.

33:42.020 --> 33:42.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:42.803 --> 33:43.804
Ah-hah. Let's get it.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.197
- Yeah?
- There you go, girl.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.852
That's nice.

33:50.506 --> 33:51.855
Take his head off.
Take his head off.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.466
That's right. Take his head off.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.815
Good.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.077
I'm feeling his
weight on me right here.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.252
Oh!

33:57.296 --> 33:58.688
Felt good, huh?

33:58.732 --> 33:59.515
Okay.

34:00.690 --> 34:01.865
Come on. Come on. Come on.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.476
Come on. Come on.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.393
Ah, there you go.

34:07.436 --> 34:08.089
What's going
on? Hey, hey, Lola, Lola.

34:08.132 --> 34:09.003
What's going on here?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.222
Hey, Lola, are you training?

34:10.264 --> 34:11.049
Man.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.527
Wes, what is this?

34:12.572 --> 34:15.531
What? I'm just getting
a work workout here.

34:15.574 --> 34:17.011
What's the problem?

34:17.054 --> 34:18.534
Baby, you're pregnant.
You should be home resting.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.101
Babe, plenty of women
train while they're pregnant.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.016
It's healthy.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.670
Yeah. Not the way you train.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.496
You're training like you're
prepping for a fight, babe.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.411
It's dangerous.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.282
I gotta stay healthy, babe.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.328
I'm not just gonna
stay at home all day.

34:29.371 --> 34:30.677
I'm just pregnant.
The baby's fine.

34:30.719 --> 34:33.114
Wow. Really? Just pregnant.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.422
All right. I'm, I'm
not gonna argue.

34:36.465 --> 34:39.120
Just, just take
it light, please.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.730
Fine.

34:40.774 --> 34:44.125
Oh, we got that appointment
with the realtor in an hour.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.996
Oh, shoot, man.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.521
I forgot.

34:48.563 --> 34:50.130
Well, can you just

34:50.175 --> 34:51.915
- Babe, we gotta see realtor-
- Okay, okay, okay.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.178
In an hour.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.527
Well, let me just
get one more round in.

34:54.570 --> 34:55.745
Lola, please. Come on.

34:55.789 --> 34:58.139
We not gonna get
another one right now.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.275
I'm coming.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.104
Thanks, guys.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.280
Hi.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.933
Hi.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.587
Are you guys familiar with
the area and the architects?

35:11.631 --> 35:12.849
Yes, we are.

35:12.893 --> 35:13.589
Great. I'm sure you're
gonna love the home.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.677
Thank you so much.

35:14.721 --> 35:15.983
Absolutely.

35:16.026 --> 35:19.073
So, this
house was built in 2015.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.902
It offers a lot of natural
sunlight in the inside,

35:21.945 --> 35:23.512
lots of storage space,

35:23.556 --> 35:25.862
and the second floor is gonna
be a blessing for the baby.

35:25.906 --> 35:26.776
Let's go that way.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.784
So, I think you are going
to love this kitchen area,

35:34.828 --> 35:38.092
because I know that you do a
lot of hosting, entertaining,

35:38.136 --> 35:42.662
so we have our granite
countertops, lots
of cabinet space,

35:42.705 --> 35:46.883
oven here, stove
top over this way.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.582
I know that you were talking
about that stove top.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.759
So, we have that, and we have
a wine cooler over this way.

35:52.802 --> 35:53.847
I mean, he does
all the cooking.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.109
Oh, okay.

35:55.153 --> 35:59.113
I do. I do.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.158
What do you think?

36:03.117 --> 36:04.466
Can we even afford it?

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
Let me worry about that.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.123
But you're the one who will
be home most of the time,

36:09.167 --> 36:10.255
so it's whatever you want.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.479
Well, whatever we decide,
we have to make it quick.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.655
It would be really hard
trying to move with a baby.

36:19.699 --> 36:20.482
Yeah.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.181
I like it.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.140
Yeah?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.359
Yeah.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.491
Reminds me of the home
I once grew up in.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.192
I could see two or three kids
running around here, you know?

36:34.235 --> 36:35.541
Three?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.499
Yeah. You don't want more?

36:38.674 --> 36:41.286
I wanna focus on
the one that we have.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.290
Of course. Mm.

36:47.553 --> 36:48.336
So?

36:52.862 --> 36:54.168
If you like it, I like it.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.038
Yeah?

36:55.082 --> 36:55.909
Yeah.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.129
Okay.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.261
We buying a house.

37:11.098 --> 37:14.014
Hey, baby girl.

37:14.057 --> 37:14.971
Hey, daddy.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.017
Oh, man.

37:22.065 --> 37:26.069
Baby, what's wrong?

37:26.113 --> 37:26.896
Is it the baby?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.116
Yeah.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.944
I'm gonna get the car.

37:30.987 --> 37:34.164
Oh, no, no, no. Dad,
no. It's not like that.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.689
Whew. Thank the
Lord. Phew. Mm.

37:42.172 --> 37:46.481
Everything is just
moving so fast, you know?

37:48.701 --> 37:51.791
That's called growing
up, baby girl.

37:53.314 --> 37:57.362
I know that. But I just
would've never thought

37:57.405 --> 38:00.626
that I would've been
the one to have a baby,

38:00.669 --> 38:03.977
and get married, and to a man?

38:04.020 --> 38:05.283
Hmm.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.155
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I love David.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.114
But what if I'm not good enough?

38:12.464 --> 38:13.465
You know, I'm not used
to seeing you like this.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.379
I know.

38:15.205 --> 38:17.599
Mama, I'm serious.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
I don't know that I can do this.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.210
You can.

38:21.429 --> 38:24.084
I was close to aborting it.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.741
I'm scared that I won't
be a good enough mother

38:28.784 --> 38:30.177
for this child.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.223
And it's not funny.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.487
Well, aborting it,
it's too late for that.

38:38.185 --> 38:41.797
Listen sweetheart, I
understand how you feel,

38:43.321 --> 38:47.194
but at the end of the day,
you made the decision.

38:48.761 --> 38:53.243
Now, neither your father nor
I could tell you what to do.

38:53.287 --> 38:54.984
But you are a grown woman now.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.247
You will always be our baby,

38:58.379 --> 39:00.120
but Lola, now it's time for you

39:00.163 --> 39:02.209
to start taking responsibility.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.733
You're gonna be fine, baby.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.301
Yeah, I
agree with your mother.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.390
I mean, look how
far you've come.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.652
Yeah.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.133
I mean, you think we
got this way overnight,

39:14.526 --> 39:15.875
but you know what saved us?

39:15.918 --> 39:16.658
Was time.

39:16.702 --> 39:17.964
Yes.

39:18.007 --> 39:18.878
So
all you gotta do

39:18.921 --> 39:21.271
is just give yourself some time.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.406
But time heals all wounds.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.842
You understand, baby girl?

39:28.540 --> 39:30.629
Guess I'll give it time.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.326
That's it. Yep.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.414
You'll do well.

39:34.807 --> 39:35.938
Right?

39:35.982 --> 39:39.289
Yeah.

39:39.333 --> 39:42.858
Man. I don't know
who's expecting.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.207
Yeah, I'm expecting one too.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.732
Y'all need help with the bill?

39:46.775 --> 39:48.821
Cause this hot as hell in here.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.039
It's just you.

39:53.129 --> 39:53.869
Let's go.

39:53.913 --> 39:54.870
What ya got, old man?

39:54.914 --> 39:55.610
- Come on, Ray.
- Come on, man.

39:55.654 --> 39:56.611
Give me that double one.

39:56.655 --> 39:57.699
No pain.

39:57.743 --> 39:58.396
There we go.
There you go.

39:58.439 --> 39:59.527
There you go.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.529
Okay.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.139
Let's get it.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.533
Ah. Come on, give it to me.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.188
One, two.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.496
You gone took my arm off, boy.

40:11.539 --> 40:14.890
Yep. You still got it, Ray,
you still got it.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.893
Lola. Where you been?.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.025
Cause you trying to
get back in the gym

40:19.068 --> 40:20.287
before you have that baby?

40:20.330 --> 40:23.377
Hm, I wish. And I
just missed being here.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.422
Miss you too, love.

40:24.465 --> 40:25.510
Hey, what's up baby?

40:25.553 --> 40:28.208
What's up,
double trouble?

40:28.251 --> 40:30.471
Hey to you too, Ray.

40:30.515 --> 40:31.777
What are you doing here?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.039
I just wanted to stop by.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.128
Yeah, but you supposed
to be home relaxing.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.435
And doing what?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.741
Relaxing, having your feet
up. You are pregnant, you know?

40:39.785 --> 40:40.699
- Babe.
- And the doctor said

40:40.742 --> 40:42.396
you should be getting rest.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.529
Babe, I can come by the
gym. I miss being here.

40:44.572 --> 40:45.486
Babe, please.

40:46.313 --> 40:47.314
Hold on. Hold on.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.620
What? What?

40:48.663 --> 40:50.012
Babe, you okay?

40:50.056 --> 40:51.187
Yes. I got this
really sharp pain.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.145
- Hey, call for help.
- Oh my god.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.102
- Call for help.
- Oh my god.

40:54.103 --> 40:54.843
We should go to the hospital.

40:54.887 --> 40:55.801
Okay. Okay. I got you.

40:55.844 --> 40:56.932
Wait. Is my water breaking?

40:56.976 --> 40:58.456
You'll be okay. Come on, babe.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.457
- Is my water breaking?
- I got you. I got you, baby.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.675
- Oh god.
- I got you. I got you.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.722
Come on. Come on.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.680
Okay. Okay. Okay.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.856
Oh, but it's coming.
It's coming. It's
coming. It's coming.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.253
Let me get a doctor.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.951
Yes, you get a doctor.
Please, get me a doctor.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.823
Please. Thank you.

41:17.866 --> 41:18.954
You're doing good.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.435
Just breathe.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.480
How is it going?

41:24.046 --> 41:26.484
Oh, doc. Can you please
just get this baby outta me?

41:26.527 --> 41:28.355
Please, please, please, please.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.923
Doc, my wife is in pain.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.054
It's been 10 hours,

41:32.098 --> 41:33.491
and still the baby's heart rate

41:33.534 --> 41:35.405
is not where I would
like for it to be.

41:36.668 --> 41:39.018
And because you're five
centimeters dilated,

41:39.061 --> 41:41.499
I think we need
to do a C-section.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.717
C-section?

41:42.761 --> 41:44.023
No. Doc, we really
wanna do this naturally.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.459
No, no, no.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.504
I don't wanna do a C-section.
I know, baby.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.635
- Babe, I don't wanna.
- I know.

41:47.679 --> 41:48.810
- We talked about this.
- I know. I know

41:48.854 --> 41:49.768
- I don't wanna do it.
- My main concern

41:49.811 --> 41:50.420
is the baby's heart rate.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.033
I got another one. Got
another one. Got another coming.

41:56.557 --> 41:57.863
Okay. Okay.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.908
Talk to me. Talk
to me. Talk to me.

41:59.952 --> 42:01.388
I don't wanna do it.

42:01.431 --> 42:02.563
- You don't have to, baby.
- I'm not gonna

42:02.607 --> 42:03.738
be able to fight.
You don't have to.

42:03.782 --> 42:04.870
You don't have to.
I'm not gonna be able

42:04.913 --> 42:06.175
to get back in the ring.
You don't have to.

42:06.219 --> 42:07.655
Baby, breathe. Just
breathe. Breathe.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.396
I'm here, okay?

42:09.439 --> 42:11.180
It's whatever you
want to do, okay?

42:11.224 --> 42:12.094
Okay.

42:12.138 --> 42:13.748
- All right?
- Okay.

42:13.792 --> 42:14.706
- I'm here. I'm here with you.
- I don't know. I don't know.

42:14.749 --> 42:15.707
I'm here with you.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.012
Is that it?

42:17.056 --> 42:18.536
That, that's, that's the
only thing we can do?

42:18.579 --> 42:21.277
That's, that's, that's the
only, only thing we can do?

42:21.321 --> 42:22.452
That's the only thing.

42:22.496 --> 42:25.281
Oh god.

42:25.325 --> 42:26.544
It's okay.

42:28.589 --> 42:33.420
- I don't wanna do it.
- It's okay.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.557
You are so beautiful.

42:41.297 --> 42:43.648
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

42:45.127 --> 42:46.651
Hey, mommy's up.

42:48.304 --> 42:49.088
How are you?

42:53.527 --> 42:54.746
That I'm wore out.

42:54.789 --> 42:57.400
I know, I know, I know.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.317
You were amazing.

43:03.232 --> 43:04.799
I didn't want
to the C-section.

43:04.843 --> 43:08.542
I know, I know. I know.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.761
I love you.

43:14.113 --> 43:16.550
I'm a dad.

43:17.507 --> 43:18.552
Dad.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.685
Thank you.

43:20.728 --> 43:22.600
You're gonna be
an amazing dad.

43:23.688 --> 43:25.603
Well, that's obvious.

43:27.474 --> 43:28.649
See, this is

43:28.693 --> 43:30.259
That's why I don't
give you compliments.

43:32.914 --> 43:34.350
Don't make me laugh.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.222
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:41.923 --> 43:43.577
Can you believe it?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.753
What are we gonna name her?

43:45.797 --> 43:50.279
Well, I was thinking
about after my grandmother.

43:51.237 --> 43:51.977
Lily.

43:53.631 --> 43:54.501
Lily.

43:54.544 --> 43:56.285
Mm hmm.

43:56.329 --> 43:57.112
I like that.

43:57.156 --> 43:58.592
You do?

43:59.985 --> 44:00.725
Okay.

44:01.987 --> 44:05.599
Hey Lily, I'm your dad.
It's daddy and mommy.

44:07.209 --> 44:09.255
Oh, Lily.

44:17.698 --> 44:18.699
Morning.

44:21.441 --> 44:22.224
How'd you sleep?

44:26.707 --> 44:27.490
Okay.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.667
Uh- huh. Good.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.148
I won't be working
a full day today.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.543
Well, what time
will you be home?

44:37.544 --> 44:39.415
Two or three.

44:39.459 --> 44:43.332
We've been getting requests
for our self-defense course.

44:43.376 --> 44:44.638
Wanna start it up again.

44:46.031 --> 44:48.120
Mm. Trying to
replace me already?

44:50.209 --> 44:51.427
Never, champ.

44:51.471 --> 44:52.385
Come here.

44:55.475 --> 44:56.215
You look amazing.

44:58.130 --> 45:00.436
I'm not the champ anymore.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.351
Well, you are to
that little girl.

45:03.439 --> 45:05.485
Hey, call if you need me.

45:05.528 --> 45:06.312
Love you.

45:08.793 --> 45:09.619
Love you.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.116
God, please, please, please.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.075
Please, god, please.
Just be quiet.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.642
Please, can't you please
just give 10 minutes, baby.

45:32.686 --> 45:34.732
Please, just give mommy
10 minutes, please.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.646
Please, just shut up.

45:39.345 --> 45:41.042
Oh, god. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

45:41.086 --> 45:43.784
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Hey, babe.

45:43.828 --> 45:46.874
Don't you hear her crying?

45:48.310 --> 45:49.572
What, you coming in get a kiss?

45:49.616 --> 45:51.400
Go and kiss your child
and make sure she okay.

45:51.444 --> 45:52.793
Go check on her.
Okay. Okay.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.534
Calm down.
You hear she crying.

45:54.577 --> 45:56.144
Don't make no sense gonna
come in here. "Hey, hey."

45:56.188 --> 45:59.931
Get your lips away from
me. Go check on your baby.

46:01.802 --> 46:02.977
No damn sense.

46:04.370 --> 46:05.501
Babe, what's, what's

46:06.633 --> 46:07.852
Oh, hey.
What are you doing?

46:09.027 --> 46:12.247
Did you really just pick
her up out of the crib?

46:12.291 --> 46:13.596
What? You told me

46:13.640 --> 46:16.512
I said go check on
her, go tend on her.

46:16.556 --> 46:17.383
Make sure she's good.

46:17.426 --> 46:18.166
Don't

46:18.210 --> 46:19.428
She finally calmed down.

46:19.472 --> 46:20.212
When you, by the
time you got there,

46:20.255 --> 46:21.517
she wasn't even

46:21.561 --> 46:22.823
screaming anymore.

46:22.867 --> 46:23.737
So why would you
then pick her up?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.043
That makes no sense to me.

46:25.086 --> 46:25.739
- You just need to breathe.
- Can you please

46:25.783 --> 46:26.305
go put her back?

46:26.348 --> 46:26.958
Okay.

46:27.001 --> 46:27.959
Go put her back.

46:28.002 --> 46:31.832
Okay. Okay.

46:31.876 --> 46:33.747
Mommy's not feeling well.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.230
Mm hmm. But Daddy
loves you. Yes.

46:38.273 --> 46:41.711
Daddy loves you. Mm hmm.

46:41.755 --> 46:43.844
What's going on?

46:43.888 --> 46:44.671
Calm down.

46:44.714 --> 46:45.803
Close the door.

46:47.369 --> 46:49.415
Hey, you wanna talk to
me and leave the door open

46:49.458 --> 46:50.590
so she can continue hearing?

46:50.633 --> 46:51.809
What are you
You just calm down.

46:51.852 --> 46:53.898
Oh, I know you did
not walk into this house

46:53.941 --> 46:55.551
and tell me to calm down.

46:55.595 --> 46:57.336
Do not put calm and down in
the same sentence together

46:57.379 --> 46:58.293
to me again ever, David.

46:58.337 --> 46:59.294
Please don't do it.

47:02.602 --> 47:03.821
I gotta get outta
this house, David.

47:03.864 --> 47:05.823
I need a job. I need
a part-time job.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.085
I need something on the
nights and weekends.

47:07.128 --> 47:08.826
I need something.

47:08.869 --> 47:10.610
Okay.
Okay. Just breathe.

47:10.653 --> 47:12.830
I make enough money, babe.

47:12.873 --> 47:14.962
This is not about the money.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.748
What is this about?

47:20.881 --> 47:23.710
I used to be
able to go anywhere

47:23.753 --> 47:25.712
and do anything I wanted to do.

47:25.755 --> 47:28.106
Whatever I wanted to do, I
could get up and just go do it.

47:28.149 --> 47:29.890
I had so much
excitement in my life.

47:29.934 --> 47:31.674
- Okay, but your job
- And now I just feel

47:31.718 --> 47:32.893
so useless.

47:32.937 --> 47:34.852
Baby. Your job is more
important than mine.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.766
You're taking care of our child.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.508
Yeah, but it
doesn't feel like it.

47:39.552 --> 47:42.163
But it is. And a job?

47:42.207 --> 47:44.557
That's just gonna make you
more tired, more stressed out.

47:44.600 --> 47:45.775
And for what?

47:45.819 --> 47:47.603
Look, I'm bringing
home the paper.

47:47.647 --> 47:49.475
That's what I do,
and I'm doing it.

47:50.955 --> 47:52.782
I don't see the
point in you working.

47:54.393 --> 47:57.091
Because I feel
trapped in this house.

47:57.135 --> 47:58.919
What did you, you
don't like the house?

47:58.963 --> 48:03.445
It's, it's not a
house. It's an island.

48:03.489 --> 48:05.926
I'm just strapped on
an island by myself

48:05.970 --> 48:10.148
with a screaming hyena,
all day long, David.

48:10.191 --> 48:12.454
I miss talking. I
miss my friends.

48:12.498 --> 48:14.413
I miss going to the gym.

48:14.456 --> 48:15.805
I miss my life.

48:15.849 --> 48:18.721
Okay. Okay. Okay.

48:18.765 --> 48:20.767
You know, one moment,
you don't want to talk,

48:20.810 --> 48:21.768
and now you miss talking.

48:21.811 --> 48:25.293
I don't understand. I don't.

48:25.337 --> 48:27.643
It's like you
never understand me.

48:27.687 --> 48:31.778
But listen, babe, but if, if
taking on more responsibility

48:31.821 --> 48:34.476
is gonna make it better, okay.

48:35.477 --> 48:38.219
Okay. Let's, let's do it.

48:42.136 --> 48:42.920
Okay.

48:44.486 --> 48:46.793
Thank you, because I really
feel like this will help, David.

48:46.836 --> 48:47.837
Okay.

48:47.881 --> 48:49.839
I need this.

48:49.883 --> 48:50.797
Come here.

48:52.233 --> 48:53.800
Come on. We'll look at
this together, all right?

48:53.843 --> 48:54.975
Okay.

48:55.019 --> 48:56.237
All right. Which one?

48:56.281 --> 48:57.021
This one?

48:57.064 --> 48:57.891
Mm hmm.

48:57.935 --> 48:58.936
Yeah?

48:58.979 --> 49:00.154
Yeah, that one.

49:00.198 --> 49:01.982
All right. If you
wanna do that, okay.

49:03.288 --> 49:04.593
You don't think
I'll be good at it?

49:04.637 --> 49:07.466
No, no. You'll be
great. You'll be great.

49:07.509 --> 49:08.858
I can be good at
whatever it is I wanna do.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.773
Thank you very much.
Yes, yes, you can.

49:10.817 --> 49:12.514
Thank you for the
greeting you gave me.

49:15.648 --> 49:16.388
Better greeting?

49:16.431 --> 49:17.215
Mm hmm.

49:19.913 --> 49:22.002
Lola.

49:22.046 --> 49:24.831
You wouldn't happen to be Queen
of the Ring Lola, would you?

49:25.919 --> 49:26.789
Yes.

49:26.833 --> 49:29.836
Yeah, I recognize you now.

49:29.879 --> 49:34.188
I was at that fight, the one
against, what was her name?

49:34.232 --> 49:35.015
Azora.

49:35.059 --> 49:35.842
Azora.

49:37.061 --> 49:38.410
You were great.

49:38.453 --> 49:39.933
Thank you.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.544
Shit. I would've
thought you would go pro.

49:42.588 --> 49:43.937
What you doing here?

49:45.460 --> 49:48.463
Just changing gears. Needed
to switch career paths.

49:48.507 --> 49:49.682
As a waitress?

49:52.163 --> 49:53.816
I have a daughter now,

49:53.860 --> 49:56.036
wanted to avoid losing
anymore brain cells.

49:56.906 --> 49:59.692
True. That whole CTE stuff.

50:00.823 --> 50:03.870
I'll tell you, I
have two boys myself.

50:03.913 --> 50:07.569
I love football, but I
would have a hard time

50:07.613 --> 50:09.615
pushing them down that path now.

50:09.658 --> 50:11.008
Exactly.

50:11.051 --> 50:13.184
Still, I think you
got what it take.

50:14.489 --> 50:15.969
Well, that's behind me now.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.275
I appreciate it, though.

50:17.318 --> 50:20.278
Yeah? Well, we would
love to have you here.

50:22.932 --> 50:24.891
You could bring a
lot of attention.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.024
When can you start?

50:28.460 --> 50:29.243
Now.

50:30.636 --> 50:31.854
Okay.

50:31.898 --> 50:33.160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:33.204 --> 50:34.074
Order up!

50:35.902 --> 50:39.123
What's wrong with
this one now? Lola?

50:40.341 --> 50:41.647
What happened?

50:41.690 --> 50:43.040
It was supposed
to be no cheese.

50:44.563 --> 50:46.260
Then why is there cheese?

50:46.304 --> 50:50.003
Well, he doesn't want the
cheese, so can you take it off?

50:50.047 --> 50:52.266
Okay, then why
did you write it?

50:55.052 --> 50:56.923
I fucked up, okay?

50:56.966 --> 50:58.925
Can you please just
take the cheese off?

50:58.968 --> 51:02.015
No, I cannot take
the cheese off.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.104
I mean, your memory
is shot, girl.

51:04.148 --> 51:07.238
You've been hit in the head a
little bit too much.

51:07.281 --> 51:08.761
It's shot.

51:08.804 --> 51:10.937
My memory is fine.

51:12.417 --> 51:14.680
Can one of you guys please
just take the damn cheese off?

51:14.723 --> 51:16.334
It's not that big of a deal.

51:16.377 --> 51:19.337
It actually is that big of
a deal, because we're working.

51:20.729 --> 51:23.210
Order up. Hand her that, please.

51:29.173 --> 51:34.134
I don't get it. Lola,
I said order up.

51:35.004 --> 51:37.137
Well, I have to serve these.

51:37.181 --> 51:38.921
Yeah, you can't
handle this one too?

51:38.965 --> 51:42.534
I mean, I thought you
was a champ.

51:42.577 --> 51:44.101
I thought you was a champ.

51:44.144 --> 51:46.929
You like what I did
with that one?

51:46.973 --> 51:48.192
I mean, if you can't handle it,

51:48.235 --> 51:49.889
I can get Anthony
here to do it for you.

51:49.932 --> 51:52.457
You know, wouldn't want
you messing up your wrist.

51:53.936 --> 51:54.676
I got it.

51:55.938 --> 51:56.678
Yeah, you got this. Uh-huh.

51:58.245 --> 52:02.641
Wait a sec. Oh. Oh. Oh.

52:03.816 --> 52:04.556
Oh.

52:04.599 --> 52:05.470
- Oh my.
- Wow.

52:05.513 --> 52:06.645
Oh, that's the TKO right there.

52:06.688 --> 52:07.994
Yeah. Yeah.

52:08.037 --> 52:10.475
You, go help her, please.
Please, go help her.

52:15.349 --> 52:16.350
Hey, what's going on?

52:16.394 --> 52:17.264
Hi.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.136
Can we get a table for two?

52:19.179 --> 52:20.659
Yeah. Let's see.

52:22.226 --> 52:25.098
And it's our anniversary,
so can we get the best table?

52:25.925 --> 52:29.885
Sure. Okay. Happy anniversary.

52:29.929 --> 52:31.452
Thank you, thank you.

52:31.496 --> 52:33.150
Can you seat
them at table four?

52:42.724 --> 52:44.161
Thank you for calling Escovich.

52:49.601 --> 52:54.083
Okay. What? How
many?

52:54.127 --> 52:55.476
Okay. I have you down for two.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.260
Thank you.

52:58.262 --> 52:59.001
Hi.

52:59.045 --> 53:00.089
Hey, how you doing?

53:00.133 --> 53:01.221
Hi. You guys
have a reservation?

53:01.265 --> 53:02.744
Yes. Table for two. Michael.

53:02.788 --> 53:05.182
Michael. Okay, Michael.

53:06.270 --> 53:08.489
I don't see you down here.

53:08.533 --> 53:11.013
What? What you mean
you don't see it there?

53:11.057 --> 53:12.537
Definitely should be there.

53:12.580 --> 53:13.364
3:00 p.m.?

53:15.279 --> 53:18.499
I have a Michelle,
but that's for 6:00 p.m.

53:18.543 --> 53:19.457
Did you call?

53:19.500 --> 53:20.719
Absolutely.

53:20.762 --> 53:21.850
- Okay.
- We come here all the time.

53:21.894 --> 53:23.374
Yeah, all the time.

53:23.417 --> 53:25.245
Oh, okay. No, no problem.
Let me just double check.

53:27.769 --> 53:29.728
Let me, let me
see what I can do.

53:31.904 --> 53:33.471
Can you go get your manager?

53:33.514 --> 53:34.646
Because we not about to stand
here and do this right now.

53:34.689 --> 53:37.083
I, I, I can take
care of it. No problem.

53:38.693 --> 53:41.435
Yeah, I can seat
you now. So sorry.

53:41.479 --> 53:42.349
Thank you very much.

53:42.393 --> 53:43.785
Okay. Seat them at table nine.

53:43.829 --> 53:47.180
Talk to me nice. Thank you.

54:06.286 --> 54:08.201
Surprise.

54:08.245 --> 54:09.246
Trina.

54:10.421 --> 54:12.466
So, this is what
it's come to, huh?

54:13.293 --> 54:14.729
Ironic.

54:14.773 --> 54:17.993
Last time in the ring,
I served your ass,

54:18.037 --> 54:21.170
and now look at you, serving me.

54:21.214 --> 54:23.999
Didn't I tell you
any time, any place?

54:24.043 --> 54:27.133
Seem like after the beat down,
you ain't got nothing left.

54:27.176 --> 54:28.830
You make me sick.

54:28.874 --> 54:30.528
Take me to my seat.

54:35.315 --> 54:36.273
Here you go.

54:39.667 --> 54:40.755
Here you go, ma'am.

54:41.930 --> 54:44.063
I don't eat cheese.

54:44.106 --> 54:46.239
I will get that fixed for you.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.284
Get her.

54:47.327 --> 54:48.285
Sorry about that.

54:48.328 --> 54:49.503
Thank you.

54:49.547 --> 54:51.288
How'd you
get the order wrong?

54:52.245 --> 54:54.378
Wake up. You can't
do shit right.

54:55.901 --> 54:58.164
You is not about to walk
past me again without my food.

54:58.207 --> 54:59.731
Is that my food?

54:59.774 --> 55:01.254
No, ma'am, but I
can get it for you right now.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.690
Like, how long does it
take for you to bring it out?

55:02.734 --> 55:05.040
You, it's been a problem
with you since I walked in.

55:05.084 --> 55:05.998
What's up with you?

55:06.041 --> 55:06.912
Yeah.

55:06.955 --> 55:08.217
Is it a bad day?

55:08.261 --> 55:09.436
Are you
gonna get her food?

55:09.480 --> 55:10.742
Ma'am, I will get
your food right now.

55:10.785 --> 55:12.178
Okay? Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.

55:12.221 --> 55:13.397
Quicker!

55:13.440 --> 55:15.007
I don't
know who trained you.

55:15.050 --> 55:15.312
I come here all the time, and
I've never dealt with this.

55:16.008 --> 55:16.791
You're still here.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.053
Okay, okay. I'll-

55:18.097 --> 55:19.272
You should leave.
You should leave.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.274
Trina, shut up.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.842
I'll get the food right away.
There's no reason to be irate.

55:23.885 --> 55:25.191
Y'all having a problem too?

55:25.234 --> 55:26.714
There's no
reason to be irate, ma'am.

55:26.758 --> 55:29.500
I'll take care of it now.
No reason. What, I'm hungry.

55:30.457 --> 55:31.632
He gave me no-

55:31.676 --> 55:33.242
She don't
respect women.

55:33.286 --> 55:36.158
Get outta here. Go get
her food. You still here.

55:36.202 --> 55:37.725
Trina, shut the fuck up.

55:37.769 --> 55:39.031
And ma'am,
What?

55:39.074 --> 55:40.728
I will get your
food. Calm down.

55:40.772 --> 55:42.251
Don't tell
me to calm down.

55:42.295 --> 55:43.557
- Waitress, please
- Why? What's the

55:43.601 --> 55:45.385
Why you gotta be all
loud in here anyway?

55:45.429 --> 55:46.734
Just shut up.
Why I gotta be all loud?

55:46.778 --> 55:48.780
You clearly need to make
a different profession.

55:48.823 --> 55:50.042
Fuck you and your food!

55:50.085 --> 55:51.391
No, fuck you!

55:51.435 --> 55:52.871
I'll get your fucking food.
Go right ahead,

55:52.914 --> 55:56.309
and I promise you, you won't
be working after tonight.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.833
I am so sorry. She's new here.

55:58.877 --> 56:00.922
Look, we got you the
best seat in the house,

56:00.966 --> 56:02.620
and your meal is on the house.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.406
Y'all need to double
check on the people

56:06.450 --> 56:09.061
that y'all hiring because
she's rude as fuck.

56:09.104 --> 56:10.367
- Please.
- I will take care

56:10.410 --> 56:11.106
I think
you should fire her.

56:11.150 --> 56:12.369
I'll take care of it.

56:12.412 --> 56:13.631
No, she
does need to be fired.

56:13.674 --> 56:14.458
After
everything that happened.

56:14.501 --> 56:15.023
- Okay.
- Very much.

56:24.293 --> 56:26.339
Miss Cinthy, let me explain.

56:26.383 --> 56:27.558
Explain nothing.

56:27.601 --> 56:29.821
You cursed the customer.
That's unacceptable.

56:29.864 --> 56:33.738
I know, but I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

56:33.781 --> 56:36.393
No, it won't happen
again because you're fired.

56:37.350 --> 56:40.092
What? But you saw
how rude she was.

56:40.135 --> 56:42.399
Yeah, I saw that,
but you can't go around

56:42.442 --> 56:45.227
cursing people out because
they're rude to you.

56:45.271 --> 56:46.751
Fuck.

56:46.794 --> 56:48.187
You gotta be above.

56:49.014 --> 56:49.928
Okay. All right.

56:51.408 --> 56:55.020
Can I at least finish the
day? Like I need this job.

56:55.063 --> 56:57.326
You know that.
I'm afraid not.

56:57.370 --> 57:00.155
You're not cut out
for this kind of work.

57:01.374 --> 57:06.031
You need patience, a lot
of patience, kindness.

57:06.858 --> 57:08.425
You're You're a killer.

57:10.035 --> 57:13.778
What you said to her? They
landed, okay? They landed.

57:13.821 --> 57:16.128
What I need for you to do

57:16.171 --> 57:18.435
is consider getting
back into the ring.

57:19.479 --> 57:20.437
Consider that.

57:50.205 --> 57:55.210
All right. What you got,
Lola?

57:55.863 --> 57:57.082
All right, all right.

58:01.347 --> 58:04.089
Shit, I feel good. All right.

58:07.875 --> 58:08.833
Hm.

58:12.706 --> 58:14.403
Any new female fighters?

58:16.971 --> 58:17.842
They too pretty.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.714
So, nobody worth training?

58:22.542 --> 58:24.370
No one has the fire you had.

58:25.502 --> 58:26.503
Had.

58:27.634 --> 58:29.680
Ouch.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.206
You know, I was thinking
about, you know,

58:35.860 --> 58:37.209
picking it back up again.

58:39.603 --> 58:40.560
What you think?

58:41.822 --> 58:43.824
Not with those abs, you won't.

58:43.868 --> 58:45.478
My incision is healed.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.524
I don't give a
damn what they say.

58:47.567 --> 58:51.092
Routine surgery or not,
they cut open your abdomen.

58:51.136 --> 58:53.486
They gotta be fast enough to
hit me in the stomach first.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.966
Oh, they will be.

58:55.009 --> 58:56.750
Especially with all that
weight you done put on you.

58:56.794 --> 58:58.099
I can burn this off.

58:58.143 --> 59:00.667
Forget it, Lola. You
had a C-section, okay?

59:00.711 --> 59:03.888
By the time that fully heals,
you'll be way past your prime.

59:07.718 --> 59:09.415
So you don't believe
in me at all, huh?

59:10.982 --> 59:13.027
You know, Diane
once told me about

59:14.551 --> 59:17.771
women having to prove to
the world that we're human.

59:17.815 --> 59:19.425
What's your motto?

59:19.468 --> 59:22.297
Cause it seem like you don't
believe in none of that shit.

59:22.341 --> 59:23.995
But I can't let nobody stop me

59:24.038 --> 59:26.519
from being who I'm
supposed to be.

59:27.607 --> 59:28.826
Come on. Damn.

59:37.791 --> 59:38.575
What?

59:39.750 --> 59:41.142
You don't want
anybody to stop you

59:41.186 --> 59:42.491
from being who you are.

59:42.535 --> 59:45.625
I just stopped your
ass with one punch.

59:45.669 --> 59:47.061
That was a sucker punch.

59:47.105 --> 59:49.890
What do you think
Trina is gonna do?

59:49.934 --> 59:52.545
Remember, I'm not gonna be
able to be there for that.

59:53.502 --> 59:56.593
Go home, Lola.

59:56.636 --> 59:58.986
Your family is waiting for you.

01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:03.643
Don't, don't do this,
Sasha. Sasha, don't do this.

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:14.611
Shit.

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:22.401
I need this.

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:28.189
Lola who?

01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:29.713
I'm the champ. This is my belt.

01:00:29.756 --> 01:00:32.324
I knew I could do it.
I'm so happy right now.

01:00:32.367 --> 01:00:33.586
It's Trina time.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.849
And nobody's gonna win
this belt back from me.

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:51.473
Why would you stop
by the other night?

01:00:51.517 --> 01:00:52.736
You wanna start boxing again?

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.567
Lola, that's just crazy.

01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:03.616
It's crazy to think I'm
capable of doing anything else.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.532
Do you wanna end up
in the hospital again?

01:01:06.575 --> 01:01:08.447
So you don't think
I can take a hit?

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:14.061
You know many times I've
been hit throughout my life?

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.194
I always get back up.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:17.108
It's what I do.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.719
I can't go through
that again, Lola.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.939
Rushing you to the hospital

01:01:21.982 --> 01:01:24.028
was the scariest
moment of my life.

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:26.030
I can't, I can't do that again.

01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:28.685
Okay. All right.

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:35.213
Do you remember
when we first met?

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:40.392
I was drifting
around, getting drunk,

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:41.698
getting myself into trouble.

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:46.354
I had no real purpose
before boxing.

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.835
And you helped me with that.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.751
It's who I am, baby.

01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:56.713
Baby, it's not about you
anymore. It's about us.

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:59.672
What you do affects us all.

01:02:00.934 --> 01:02:03.110
You have to think about
what's best for Lily.

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:06.461
You don't think I think
about what's best for Lily?

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:08.681
Well, what do you think is best?

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:12.729
Being home, being
there, being safe.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.645
Being home.

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:25.306
Okay, fine.

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:29.484
If that makes you happy.

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.489
It would.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.362
It would.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:41.540
Okay.

01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:42.367
Thank you.

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:51.768
Yo, Ray, let me tell
you one thing, okay?

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:55.336
The kids of these days do not
respect the history of boxing.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.685
You understand?

01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:57.861
I mean, if they don't
know where they've been,

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:58.818
how the hell they
know where they go?

01:02:58.862 --> 01:02:59.993
You right, you right.

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:00.820
I mean we got the
great Charles Burley

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.343
and the Black Murderers' Row.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:03.997
You got a kid that you
training that reminds me of him.

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.694
Exactly. Then
you got Willie Pep

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.566
- Yes, sir.
- and the great Rocky Marciano

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:08.959
You right.

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:10.743
and my favorite, the
great Jersey Joe Walcott.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:11.613
Cake walk, baby.

01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:12.745
Yes, sir.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:13.746
Lola!

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.139
- Hey, hey.
- What's up?

01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:16.227
- Oh my goodness.
- Big trouble, little trouble.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.750
What's up?
Oh, please.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:18.925
Hey, Ray.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:20.100
- See you, homeboy.
- What's going on?

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.275
- See you, homeboy.
- Good, how y'all doing?

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.102
We good. We good.

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.408
Ah, I miss you guys.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:24.844
You done brought the
future champ to see us.

01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:25.758
That's right.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.194
You ready to start training?

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:29.544
I am. That's why I'm here.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:30.545
Does David know?

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:33.244
David wouldn't approve, Ray.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:34.549
He's still upset about how

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:35.899
I went behind his
back last time.

01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:36.856
Damn, man. Look it, man.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.466
He's just worried about

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:40.729
this little bundle
of joy here, girl.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:42.688
You made a champion.

01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:44.429
Let me talk to him.

01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:46.605
I don't know that
that would work, Ray.

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:49.303
He doesn't see me for
the fighter that I am.

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:51.305
He only sees me as
a mother and a wife.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.787
The only way I can
prove I'm wrong, guys,

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:55.701
is if I beat Trina.

01:03:55.744 --> 01:03:57.616
I need your help, come on.

01:03:57.659 --> 01:03:59.661
What about that stomach?

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:00.706
I've been working
out every day.

01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:02.229
- Hmm.
- 500 crunches a day.

01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:05.015
For the past month, I
have been at it, guys.

01:04:05.058 --> 01:04:06.973
Come on, man. I need you.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:08.235
Well, that's what
it's gonna take,

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:09.846
but I'm gonna tell
you one thing.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.674
Trina hasn't tested any one
twos as to that stomach.

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:14.938
If Trina tears those
incisions in your stomach,

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:17.854
David is going to
never forgive me, ever.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:20.726
I don't want to agree
with him, but I have to.

01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:25.731
Look, you guys know me.

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:28.734
You know me.

01:04:28.777 --> 01:04:31.476
I'm gonna train for this
fight with or without you.

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:34.696
Now, I'd prefer to do it with
you or I'm gonna do it on own.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.307
And run the risk
of getting hurt.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.879
Wow. I guess, little Lily,
we don't have any choice.

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:43.705
Yeah.

01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:45.098
Lola is the best.

01:04:45.142 --> 01:04:46.012
Come on.

01:04:46.056 --> 01:04:47.666
Better than all the rest.

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:48.580
- What I'm talking about.
- There's my right girl.

01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:49.624
That's what I wanna hear.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:50.538
Get it.
Let's get it going.

01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:51.931
We gonna do it. We gonna do it.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:53.846
Ray, come on,
Ray. Come on, Ray.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.763
Come on, Ray.
Fine. Whatever.

01:04:57.806 --> 01:04:58.851
- Thank you, man.
- Whatever.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.418
All right. Let's
get to training.

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:01.810
- Let's get to training.
- All right, let's do it.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.863
What's up, champ?

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.996
What's up coach?

01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:15.085
Nothing much. Just
enjoying this delicious,

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:18.262
nutritious banana. You
should eat more of these.

01:05:19.132 --> 01:05:19.916
Okay?

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:22.614
I heard a new song today.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.184
It's called word on
the street.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.968
♪ Word on the street

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:33.016
That Lola's back in the
gym training, again.

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:34.931
What that mean?

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.194
What that means is,

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:39.892
her whole entire crew's
talking a lot of shit,

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.460
said, "She coming
to beat your ass."

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:44.505
And they hit the ass hard.

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.681
"Whoop your ass,"
that's what they said.

01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:49.075
Well, me and you
was both there.

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:50.381
I beat her already.

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:51.295
Yeah.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.515
But you know what everybody's
saying about you beating her.

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.778
They said that she was
pregnant in the ring,

01:05:56.822 --> 01:05:59.607
and that's the only reason
why you did beat her.

01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:02.436
And that's confirmed.
Well, pregnancy part.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:05.526
I beat her fair and square.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.442
Rather she was pregnant or
not, I still would've beat her.

01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.837
Okay. So what you
gonna do about this now?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.709
You gonna let this
ride all this talk?

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:16.973
Or are you gonna get back
in the ring? What's up?

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:19.018
You sound like you with them.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.541
I got her. I got it.

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:21.978
Don't worry about it, coach.

01:06:22.021 --> 01:06:24.023
I'll beat her again,
just like I did before.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.678
All right, we'll
see about that.

01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.985
They don't call me the
J.Lo of boxing for nothing.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.161
I could either take you
there or drop you down.

01:06:31.204 --> 01:06:35.556
So, let's see if you beat
her ass. Eat a banana.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:52.834
Lola, Lola, Lola.

01:06:54.488 --> 01:06:55.359
How's my girl?

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:57.970
Good.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.493
Me check your temperature.

01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:01.060
I gotta make sure you ready.

01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.063

rules of fighting.

over all of them.

There we go.

That timing and
rhythm is gonna

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.307
form the basis of
everything you do.

We live in the same house, but
we barely even cross paths.

We don't even sleep in
the same bed anymore.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.197
I know that's hard.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:48.244

Yeah, man. It ain't
that easy right now.

Listen, listen, you can't
stand here punching this bag.

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:58.166
Go find your wife,
go talk to your wife.

know y'all love each other.

Hey. What are you
guys doing here?

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:41.819
Yeah.

When did Lola
get a second job?

01:11:44.212 --> 01:11:46.693
- Like two weeks ago. Right.
- Couple of weeks ago.

01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:49.217
Where's she working?

01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:51.263
I don't know. Some bar,
sports bar or something.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.220
Sports bar?

01:11:55.963 --> 01:11:56.877
This is unbelievable.

01:12:00.054 --> 01:12:00.794

Hey.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.786
Stopped by your job tonight.

01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:40.007
Yeah, I got off early.

01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:43.271
So, I just wanted to come
by and get some work in.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.187
Sorry I didn't call you.

01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:47.928
You go anywhere after the bar?

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:49.800
What's with all
the questions, David?

01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:52.542
Curious about my wife's
life. I am your husband, right?

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:54.152
Right.

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:56.415
You're my husband, not my dad.

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:57.808
Might as well be,

01:12:57.851 --> 01:12:59.200
with you acting like a
child and everything.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:00.419
And what is that
supposed to mean?

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:01.464
I spoke to your manager.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.817
Okay, so I got fired.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.733
Months ago, Lola. Jesus.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:13:09.776 --> 01:13:11.909
And what good
would that have done?

01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:15.216
All you would've tried to do
is convince me to stay at home.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.522
And what's wrong with that?

01:13:16.566 --> 01:13:18.350
Because I'm not a
fucking dog, David.

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:21.962
And don't get pissed at me
because I still have a life.

01:13:22.006 --> 01:13:23.573
I'm coming here pissed
because you know what?

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.226
I'm not part of that life.

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:28.447
I'm trying to build something
with you, something for us.

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:30.406
Well, I can't be
who you want me to be.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:31.407
Who do you want
to be, huh? Who?

01:13:35.715 --> 01:13:39.589
Where were you
these past few months?

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:46.334
I've been training.

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.771
For what?

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.076
For Trina.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.122
Lola, are you outta
your freaking mind?

01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:54.212
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:55.343
You don't support me.

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:57.433
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:14:00.392
One hit to the stomach and
it's over. It's over, Lola.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.046
I can take her!

01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:04.135
Do you want your daughter
to grow up without a mother?

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:05.528
Now why would you say
some shit like that?

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:07.965
No, Lily's not gonna
grow up without me.

01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:10.707
What is this? Is this
for your fucking pride?

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.144
This is not about pride.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:16.887
I don't understand why
you don't get that.

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.279
Then what is it? Huh?

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.717
Things have changed, Lola.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.591
No. See, you have
changed, David.

01:14:27.114 --> 01:14:31.467
I'm still who I am, and I
can't let you or anybody else

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.381
stop me from doing
what I wanna do,

01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:35.122
from being who I wanna be!

01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:41.389
I won't do it.

01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:42.478
You won't stop?

01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:46.264
Not for me?

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:50.268
No.

01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:53.445
And Lily?

01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:58.363
David, I'm doing
all of this for Lily.

01:14:58.406 --> 01:15:02.541
Is that what you
think this is?

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.108
You are so selfish.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:07.938
I won't stay here and
watch you kill yourself.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:10.418
Kill myself?

01:15:13.552 --> 01:15:14.901
You just don't believe in me.

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:19.036
David.

01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:33.703
Then don't.

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:53.505
Now, Whoa. You look
like you training

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.289
to get back in the ring again.

01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:59.772
Oh, don't worry, I'm
not gonna train you.

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:00.599
You're getting a
little too fat anyway.

01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:03.167
Come on, stop.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:04.472
What's wrong with you?

01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:07.171
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:10.391
Fine. Sulk.

01:16:10.435 --> 01:16:11.567
Lola's boxing again.

01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:16.528
Once a fighter,
always a fighter.

01:16:17.747 --> 01:16:19.966
Oh my God. You knew.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.228
I knew.

01:16:21.272 --> 01:16:23.100
I can't believe
you. You're my family.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:25.624
You're my aunt. Why
wouldn't you tell me?

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.800
It's because it's what
she needs right now.

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:29.759
Like it or not,
it's what she needs.

01:16:29.802 --> 01:16:31.456
And you choose her
over your own nephew?

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.806
I choose to believe in her.

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:35.416
You have no idea.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.288
It's been so long
since I've seen

01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:39.595
a female boxer this passionate.

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.988
The circumstances
may have changed,

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:44.948
but she's a fighter,
David, she's a fighter.

01:16:46.123 --> 01:16:47.124
Does Ray know too?

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:49.082
West?

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.566
I can't believe you guys.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.828
- Oh, come on.
- You know what?

01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:57.482
Don't let me interrupt
your little fight club.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.137
Oh, come on, David.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.094
David.

01:17:01.138 --> 01:17:02.574
Hey! Uh-uh.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.708
Don't you walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.453
Now, I may not be your mother,

01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:14.455
and I don't care
how big you got,

01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:16.675
but I will clean knock
you the fuck out.

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:17.720
Do you understand?

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:19.809
Now, you stay right here,

01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:21.941
and you finish this
conversation with me.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:25.466
Not this time.

01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:37.696
You're adorable.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.227
You're so beautiful.

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:54.670
Thank you, for making me better.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:59.065
I love you so much.

01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:00.806
And you're all mine.

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:02.068
Oh, I love you.

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:16.648
Hey.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:17.475
Hey.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.314
Careful. Careful.

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:31.663
I got it. Okay.

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:41.717
Take her with me.

01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:46.939
Well, don't you think she
should be with her mother?

01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:47.897
She should be.

01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:50.551
But you have other priorities.

01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:53.206
David.

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.686
Gonna take some
time off of work.

01:18:57.428 --> 01:18:58.777
Good luck with everything.

01:19:01.432 --> 01:19:04.348
David. David, please
don't do this. Please don't.

01:19:18.841 --> 01:19:20.756
Ladies
and gentlemen,

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:25.369
we are now moments away from
the main event of the evening.

01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:27.458
How's everyone
enjoying themselves?

01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:31.114
What? I can't hear you.

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.773
So, before we get started,

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.862
I would love to bring
the founders out

01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.646
of Double Knockout Promotions,

01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:45.519
who created the Queen of the
Ring Amateur Boxing Tournament,

01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:47.130
to come and say a few words.

01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:48.871
All right, now.

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:51.830
So excited
to be here tonight.

01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:54.659
Seeing all the
enthusiasm in the seats

01:19:54.702 --> 01:19:56.661
literally warms my heart.

01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:59.795
Do you guys remember
the Double Knockout Girls?

01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:02.101
We knocked each other out.
Do you guys remember that?

01:20:02.928 --> 01:20:04.190
Oh, wow. They remember.

01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:07.628
I mean, that night the
capacity was for 500.

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:10.762
We filled the seats
with over 900 people,

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.286
and then we took our
money, put it together,

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.898
and decided to open up
a gym for young women,

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:19.597
so they can go out and box
and just have a safe space.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.861
We are number
one in the country

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:26.778
at selling out boxing
arenas, and we are females.

01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:30.738
Give it up. Don't act like
you don't know. Give it up!

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:33.654
Are you ready to rumble?

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:42.533
Ladies
and gentlemen,

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:45.623
thank you for coming out to
this highly anticipated fight.

01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:46.798
In the red corner,

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.191
we have the challenger,

01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:51.368
fighting out of
Diane's Boxing Academy,

01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:55.807
with an amateur boxing record
of five wins and one loss,

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.854
with five wins by
way of knockout,

01:20:58.897 --> 01:21:02.031
Lola Williams.

01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:05.904
And in the black corner,

01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:09.212
fighting out of All
Elite Boxing Club,

01:21:09.255 --> 01:21:10.778
from Brooklyn, New York,

01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:13.216
with an undefeated
12 and oh record,

01:21:13.259 --> 01:21:17.698
all by knockout, the reigning,
undefeated Queen of the Ring,

01:21:17.742 --> 01:21:21.659
Trina 'Doomsday' Jackson.

01:21:26.533 --> 01:21:27.795
Fighters ready? Fight!

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.843
Come on, Lola.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:34.846
Lola is
an outstanding fighter

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.282
from the outside.

01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:38.502
Look at that lightning
footwork already put to use.

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:39.895
Come on,
change levels on her.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:41.157
Let's go, Lola.

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.900
Get in,
get in. Come on.

01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:51.907
Trina
just throws her clear
across the ring.

01:21:53.343 --> 01:21:55.911
Oh! Lola
definitely felt that one.

01:21:57.173 --> 01:21:57.956
That's the bell to end

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.218
an aggressive round one.

01:21:59.262 --> 01:22:00.828
I'll tell you, if
the fight is anything

01:22:00.872 --> 01:22:03.919
like this first round,
we are in for a treat.

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:07.183
Come on, we got this. Come on.

01:22:07.226 --> 01:22:09.968
Come on, Lola. I need
you to pace yourself.

01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:11.970
All right? I need
you to move around.

01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:13.406
Why is there a round two?

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.278
You supposed to bend and
knock that bitch out.

01:22:15.321 --> 01:22:17.584
Do you need me to get in here
and fight this fight for you?

01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:19.151
Cause I will.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.849
And when I do, you gonna owe
me some motherfucking money.

01:22:21.893 --> 01:22:23.808
I need you to remix this bitch.

01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:24.722
I got you.

01:22:24.765 --> 01:22:26.680
All right. Whoop that trick.

01:22:26.724 --> 01:22:27.594
Fight!

01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:37.909
All right, Lola. You got this.

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:40.956
Oh!

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:41.869
Lola, pace yourself. Come on.

01:22:41.913 --> 01:22:43.001
Stay on the outside.

01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:49.660
Doomsday
fully is taunting her.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:52.010
You better rock her
to sleep. Come on.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.454
Oh
my God. Lola is down.

01:23:01.498 --> 01:23:02.194
Get up.

01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:03.021
One

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:10.246
Stay down bitch.
Stay yo ass down.

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:13.858
Four

01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:14.728
Get up, Lola. Get up.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:17.993
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.126
You good?

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:22.649
Can fight?
Yeah.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.089
This is a dangerous
place for Lola to be.

01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.352
Yeah, she's just too
weak to be in there.

01:23:31.223 --> 01:23:34.052
All right. You doing
real good out there.

01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:38.056
Come on, come on. That
ain't even a knockdown.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.971
Don't let that knockdown
bother you. You understand?

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.842
You got this. You understand me?

01:23:41.886 --> 01:23:43.192
He not coming, is he?

01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:44.802
Don't worry about that.

01:23:44.845 --> 01:23:46.456
I need you to get your head
in the game. All right?

01:23:46.499 --> 01:23:47.892
I need you to jab.
I need you to move.

01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:49.415
We can do this.

01:23:57.815 --> 01:23:58.598
Get her, Lola.

01:24:00.992 --> 01:24:02.602
Come on, to the chair.

01:24:02.646 --> 01:24:03.560
Keep moving.

01:24:04.387 --> 01:24:05.562
Yeah, that's it, Lola.

01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:10.828
Oh! That was a hard right,
right there to the chin.

01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:13.135
You gone pulverize that bitch.

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:15.267
If I got to come back
in here again, girl.

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.269
Now do it.
Okay.

01:24:21.839 --> 01:24:24.015
I wouldn't wanna feel
those hits from Trina.

01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:36.114
Whoa Lola lands
a crazy body shot.

01:24:36.158 --> 01:24:37.028
Yeah, she did.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.682
Come on, you got it. Let's go.

01:24:38.725 --> 01:24:40.205
Trina answers back.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:41.989
Oh.

01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:43.034
Whoa.

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.557
I gotta tell you,

01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:47.647
this has been a dog fight
between these two champions.

01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:50.650
Clap that bitch.

01:24:58.136 --> 01:24:59.006
Come on, Lola.

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:05.361
I cannot believe
how close that it is.

01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:07.406
It's been blow for
blow all night.

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:10.453
What the hell is
going on out there? Huh?

01:25:10.496 --> 01:25:12.107
What is this shit?

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.543
You got this bitch flipping
on you, look at your eye.

01:25:13.586 --> 01:25:15.632
Why does your eye
look like that?

01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:16.589
She hit me, shit.

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:17.851
Shit, but you let her hit you.

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:19.549
Why the fuck you
letting her hit you?

01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:21.116
Knock that bitch
all the way out.

01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:22.508
You looking like
you've been in a war

01:25:22.552 --> 01:25:24.771
with Shaquille O'Neal's
fucking big toenail.

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:26.077
They fucking crusty as
Give me my mouthpiece.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:27.209
Yeah. You don't
like that shit.

01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:28.645
Don't nobody like Shaq's feet.

01:25:28.688 --> 01:25:30.168
Go in there, whip that bitch in.

01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:36.522
Trina is controlling
this round.

01:25:40.396 --> 01:25:42.049
Hands up. Come on, Lola.

01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:47.403
Saved by the bell.

01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:49.100
She really was.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.843
And looks like we're headed
to the eighth and final round.

01:25:58.022 --> 01:26:01.591
Lola, what are you doing?

01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:02.722
What is going on?

01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:04.202
She's just so strong.

01:26:04.246 --> 01:26:06.117
What have we been
doing this all for?

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.988
Where's that Warrior Spirit?

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:09.990
Forget about doing it
for everybody else.

01:26:10.034 --> 01:26:13.168
You gotta do this for yourself.
You gotta do it for Lola.

01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:19.086
Hey baby, don't quit now.

01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.349
Okay?

01:26:20.392 --> 01:26:22.786
This is your legacy for
Lily to follow, okay?

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:28.313
Go out there and turn
it all back, baby.

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:29.271
I love you.

01:26:35.712 --> 01:26:39.498
Lola is the best.
Better than all the rest.

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:42.893
Lola is the best.
Better than the rest.

01:26:46.288 --> 01:26:48.855
You better put them arms
up. Keep them arms up.

01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:51.162
All right, switch Lola. Now

01:26:52.163 --> 01:26:54.339
What the fuck is you doing?

01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:56.950
Yes, baby, you got it baby.

01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:00.650
Looks
like Lola's getting tired

01:27:00.693 --> 01:27:02.217
of Trina putting
her weight on her.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.740
Let's go, Lola.

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.570
Bitch, come on.

01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:14.968
Oh! Goes
down from a crazy left hook.

01:27:15.969 --> 01:27:17.319
Are you serious?

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:25.022
Two, three, four.

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.198
Five, six.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.286
No, no wait.

01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:30.027
Trina is back on her feet

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:33.291
with only a few seconds
left of this final round.

01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:36.120
They are really gassed.

01:27:37.164 --> 01:27:37.948
We are done.

01:27:45.869 --> 01:27:47.262
And
that's the bell.

01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:49.133
They went the distance in
this championship fight.

01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:04.061
Hey.

01:28:04.104 --> 01:28:05.280
Hey, girl.

01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:08.021
You fought one hell
of a fight tonight.

01:28:08.065 --> 01:28:08.979
So did you.

01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:11.460
Where's your team?

01:28:13.026 --> 01:28:15.507
I probably don't have a
team no more, but, but listen,

01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:18.118
I wanna apologize for
crashing your wedding,

01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:19.511
and saying all that
stupid shit that I said.

01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:21.687
Oh man, that's
all in the past.

01:28:21.731 --> 01:28:23.385
We both did a lot of growing
because of this fight.

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:24.951
Yeah.

01:28:24.995 --> 01:28:27.519
And because of what you said,
caused this big ass event.

01:28:27.563 --> 01:28:29.173
And this is the
amateur fight.

01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:32.785
You know, we all fucked
up in amateurs.

01:28:33.917 --> 01:28:35.397
This will definitely
make headlines.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.223
Yes.

01:28:36.267 --> 01:28:37.877
And we did that.

01:28:39.009 --> 01:28:40.750
You definitely earned
my respect, Lola.

01:28:40.793 --> 01:28:41.533
Truce.

01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:44.188
My girl.

01:28:44.231 --> 01:28:46.930
Wow, what an incredible match.

01:28:46.973 --> 01:28:50.803
After eight hard championship
rounds at Queen of the Ring,

01:28:50.847 --> 01:28:53.284
the judges score
the fight 76-76,

01:28:56.418 --> 01:28:59.203
declaring the match a draw.

01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:05.296
So the fight ended
and they draw tonight.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.863
How do you feel about that?

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.822
You know, what can I say?

01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:11.389
You know, she's
a great contender

01:29:11.433 --> 01:29:14.479
and she proved that she can
bang with the best of us

01:29:14.523 --> 01:29:17.134
and she has my respect
because he proved tonight

01:29:17.177 --> 01:29:20.180
that we can put on a
great show and go to war.

01:29:20.224 --> 01:29:22.705
Thank you so much, Trina.

01:29:22.748 --> 01:29:26.317
Now Lola, how do you feel
about the draw tonight?

01:29:27.274 --> 01:29:29.668
I mean, it was a tough battle.

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:31.714
It could have gone either way.

01:29:31.757 --> 01:29:34.934
Man, this was definitely
one of the toughest fights

01:29:34.978 --> 01:29:36.458
I've ever been in.

01:29:36.501 --> 01:29:40.462

I've ever been up against.
