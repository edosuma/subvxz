00:00.142 --> 00:02.228
What's up? Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:02.229 --> 00:04.397
Today, we're gonna talk
about code-switching.

00:04.398 --> 00:06.372
That's when you adapt the way you act

00:06.373 --> 00:07.840
to match the people you're with.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.475
For example: Obama.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.577
When dignitaries would
visit the White House,

00:11.578 --> 00:13.779
Obama would be like,
"Hello, Prime Minister.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.567
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance."

00:16.361 --> 00:20.166
But when LeBron won the championship
and the Cavs came to the White House.

00:20.167 --> 00:20.804
Barack was like

00:20.805 --> 00:22.758
"Yo, what up, 'Bron, 'Bron?

00:22.759 --> 00:25.027
It's your boy, Barack."

00:25.028 --> 00:26.629
Me? I don't code-switch.

00:26.630 --> 00:28.898
I'm just me 24/7.

00:28.899 --> 00:29.965
Know what I mean?

00:37.440 --> 00:42.443
Subtitle sync and corrections by
awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

00:45.115 --> 00:47.516
Okay, so does this dress say

00:47.517 --> 00:49.785
"sophisticated, independent woman"?

00:49.786 --> 00:51.820
More like "Eat at Sizzler

00:51.821 --> 00:54.823
and smash in the back
of a Dodge Stratus."

00:56.593 --> 00:59.662
This is your dress, Yvette.

00:59.663 --> 01:02.698
Well, that's how I know what it says.

01:02.699 --> 01:05.367
I can't believe you got
into the Avalon Society.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.803
I've been on that club's
waiting list for three years.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.506
Now you can put in a
good word for your girl.

01:10.507 --> 01:12.074
- Yvette.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.075 --> 01:13.409
I'm not in yet, okay?

01:13.410 --> 01:16.145
It's just a mixer for
potential new members.

01:16.146 --> 01:18.380
But how exciting would that be, right?

01:18.381 --> 01:20.216
Work connections, new friends.

01:20.217 --> 01:22.251
I really need to expand
my social circles.

01:22.252 --> 01:23.285
Me too.

01:23.286 --> 01:24.687
We could do so much better

01:24.688 --> 01:27.056
than each other.

01:27.057 --> 01:28.958
Wait, you're bringing Marlon, aren't you?

01:28.959 --> 01:31.894
That would be a helluva no.

01:31.895 --> 01:35.130
The Avalon is a group of
sophisticated, mature people.

01:35.131 --> 01:37.866
Who prefer married couples.

01:37.867 --> 01:40.002
I've done my research,
and I don't blame 'em.

01:40.003 --> 01:42.104
Can you imagine bringing all of this

01:42.105 --> 01:45.574
around all those well-to-do husbands?

01:45.575 --> 01:47.676
I'm like alimony in heels.

01:49.813 --> 01:51.213
But trust me.

01:51.214 --> 01:52.712
You'll have a better chance of getting in

01:52.713 --> 01:53.782
if you bring Marlon.

01:53.783 --> 01:55.384
Ashley, check it out.

01:55.385 --> 01:58.487
I just taught Zack how
to save a fart in a jar.

01:59.589 --> 02:01.724
Yeah, leave his ass home.

02:01.725 --> 02:03.192
Hey, remember, let that mature

02:03.193 --> 02:04.727
for two to three weeks,

02:04.728 --> 02:06.161
then let it out somewhere special

02:06.162 --> 02:08.697
like Mommy's room.

02:08.698 --> 02:10.966
What was y'all talking about?
Leave me home from what?

02:10.967 --> 02:14.036
Oh, I'm just going to a
soiree at the Avalon Club.

02:14.037 --> 02:15.237
That's their word, not mine.

02:15.238 --> 02:17.139
Hey, I'm down for a soiree.

02:17.140 --> 02:19.441
I don't know what it is,
but as long as it don't mean

02:19.442 --> 02:21.710
putting fingers in
weird places, I'm like...

02:21.711 --> 02:24.146
Uh, thank you very much,
but I'm fine on my own.

02:24.147 --> 02:25.748
Ashley, I'm sure you're aware

02:25.749 --> 02:27.349
of the Avalon's long-standing tradition

02:27.350 --> 02:29.251
of favoring couples over singles.

02:29.252 --> 02:31.153
See? Even Stevie knows.

02:31.154 --> 02:34.189
And he don't even know
how to comb his hair.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:35.944 --> 02:38.193
What does an unemployed 40-something

02:38.194 --> 02:40.396
who lives on another man's couch

02:40.397 --> 02:41.997
know about the Avalon Society?

02:41.998 --> 02:43.932
A few guys from my Howell University

02:43.933 --> 02:45.601
a cappella group are members there.

02:45.602 --> 02:47.403
The Lil' Treblemakers.

02:48.838 --> 02:50.439
I have an open invitation.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.940
I'm on the waiting list,

02:51.941 --> 02:55.644
but they're gonna let in
your Top Ramen-eating ass?

02:55.645 --> 02:59.682
Ramen is the most traded
item in prison, so...

02:59.683 --> 03:03.218
there's a fact for you.

03:03.219 --> 03:04.486
Ashley, why wouldn't you bring me?

03:04.487 --> 03:05.654
Listen, if being a couple

03:05.655 --> 03:07.156
helps your chances of getting in,

03:07.157 --> 03:08.557
let's tag team this.

03:08.558 --> 03:10.492
Come on, you know I'm
a natural icebreaker.

03:10.493 --> 03:12.194
I also know that you

03:12.195 --> 03:15.164
are entirely inappropriate
in social settings.

03:15.165 --> 03:16.965
Inappropriate. You name one time

03:16.966 --> 03:19.268
- I was inappropriate.
- Marley?

03:19.269 --> 03:21.904
Wait, what are you gonna
bring the babies into this for?

03:21.905 --> 03:23.072
What did Daddy do

03:23.073 --> 03:25.040
when you won the spelling bee last year?

03:26.643 --> 03:28.377
"That's my baby.

03:28.378 --> 03:33.048
I told y'all she ain't dumb."

03:33.049 --> 03:35.117
First of all, I didn't
stand in the chair,

03:35.118 --> 03:36.452
because somebody was in it.

03:36.453 --> 03:39.755
I was on somebody's lap.

03:39.756 --> 03:41.256
And it was "Oh, no,

03:41.257 --> 03:44.860
I told you my baby wasn't a stupid ass."

03:46.429 --> 03:49.365
And that's just called parental support.

03:49.366 --> 03:50.866
Okay, but I can be appropriate.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.267
I have levels.

03:54.471 --> 03:57.473
What you have is no impulse control.

03:57.474 --> 03:59.074
You can't notice a bald guy,

03:59.075 --> 04:00.509
a pregnant woman, or a little person

04:00.510 --> 04:02.544
without saying something inappropriate.

04:04.147 --> 04:06.448
Exactly. I don't discriminate.

04:08.351 --> 04:11.019
Marlon, this club is important to me.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.188
And if I get in, it could be very big

04:13.189 --> 04:15.023
for my design business, okay?

04:15.024 --> 04:18.093
You know, the fact that you
don't think I can control myself

04:18.094 --> 04:22.431
for a few hours is... is quite insulting.

04:22.432 --> 04:24.600
Now can you pass me that jar?

04:24.601 --> 04:27.102
I got a rumbly in my tumbly.

04:33.843 --> 04:35.878
Good evening, I'm Ashley Wayne.

04:35.879 --> 04:36.879
Ah, yes, Mrs. Wayne,

04:36.880 --> 04:38.614
your plus-one is already here.

04:38.615 --> 04:40.682
I'm sorry, my what?

04:48.425 --> 04:50.392
Hello, darling.

04:50.393 --> 04:53.729
What an appropriate
time for you to arrive.

05:00.628 --> 05:03.201
Marlon, what are you doing here?

05:03.202 --> 05:04.590
I'm being appropriate.

05:04.591 --> 05:07.727
You look like the black Professor Plum.

05:07.728 --> 05:09.695
Board game humor?

05:09.696 --> 05:12.265
It's inappropriate in a
fine establishment like this.

05:12.266 --> 05:15.201
Okay, Marlon, go home.

05:15.202 --> 05:17.870
Listen, I realize I wasn't
the most appropriate guy

05:17.871 --> 05:18.838
during our marriage.

05:18.839 --> 05:21.573
Or before, or after.

05:21.574 --> 05:23.008
Thanks.

05:23.009 --> 05:24.442
And I'm sorry about that,

05:24.443 --> 05:26.111
but see, I know this is important to you,

05:26.112 --> 05:28.880
so I'm gonna help you
get into this chichi club.

05:28.881 --> 05:32.918
Marlon, you are the last
person I want here tonight.

05:32.919 --> 05:34.252
Stephandre J. Noggle.

05:34.253 --> 05:36.688
I'm on the list.

05:36.689 --> 05:40.926
You're the third to last
person I want here tonight.

05:40.927 --> 05:41.993
Excuse me.

05:41.994 --> 05:43.495
- Oh!
- Hi.

05:43.496 --> 05:45.334
Why are you treating
my night at the Avalon

05:45.335 --> 05:46.930
like UberPool?

05:48.234 --> 05:50.936
Yvette wanted to enjoy
the finer side of life.

05:50.937 --> 05:54.773
And Stevie wanted to enjoy
the freer side of food.

05:54.774 --> 05:56.207
Ooh.

05:56.208 --> 05:58.310
- Okay.
- Mmm.

05:59.378 --> 06:02.447
Oh! It's Karen Sinclair.

06:02.448 --> 06:04.082
Who?

06:04.083 --> 06:06.051
She is a design mogul,

06:06.052 --> 06:07.485
a personal hero of mine,

06:07.486 --> 06:08.853
but more importantly,

06:08.854 --> 06:10.488
she heads up the membership board.

06:10.489 --> 06:12.390
Oh.

06:12.391 --> 06:14.359
Stay.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.162
Karen, hi, I'm Ashley Wayne.

06:17.163 --> 06:18.596
I'm a prospective member.

06:18.597 --> 06:20.865
Oh. Well, nice to meet you.

06:20.866 --> 06:22.968
I have to say, your throw pillows

06:22.969 --> 06:24.703
this season... just magnificent.

06:24.704 --> 06:27.505
Yes, that's all she ever talks about.

06:27.506 --> 06:28.840
I'm sorry, forgive me.

06:28.841 --> 06:31.509
I am Marlon, Ashley's husband.

06:31.510 --> 06:32.544
Oh.

06:32.545 --> 06:34.045
Enchanté.

06:35.781 --> 06:38.283
Thank you.

06:38.284 --> 06:40.452
You are a delightful couple.

06:40.453 --> 06:42.854
Not nearly as delightful

06:42.855 --> 06:45.223
as that fetching dress.

06:45.224 --> 06:47.792
I'm sorry, was that inappropriate?

06:47.793 --> 06:50.161
Not at all.

06:50.162 --> 06:53.398
Mm. Not at all.

06:56.235 --> 06:57.836
Let me introduce you two

06:57.837 --> 06:59.838
to some of our other board members.

06:59.839 --> 07:01.139
Okay, excuse us one second.

07:01.140 --> 07:03.842
She's gonna introduce
you to white people.

07:06.912 --> 07:09.514
Okay, fine, you can stay.

07:09.515 --> 07:11.049
She thinks we're delightful.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.084
But don't touch nothing,
don't ask for nothing,

07:13.085 --> 07:15.322
and do not embarrass me
in front of these people.

07:15.323 --> 07:17.922
Damn, you sound like my
mama at the grocery store.

07:19.625 --> 07:20.692
Okay, okay.

07:20.693 --> 07:21.659
- All right.
- Okay.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.661
Oh, hi, can I have a glass

07:23.662 --> 07:25.663
of your best moscato?

07:25.664 --> 07:27.332
Yvette, allow me.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.034
Je voudrais votre meilleure bouteille

07:29.035 --> 07:32.637
de Jacques Selosse Grand
Cru Avize Extra Brut.

07:32.638 --> 07:34.606
Hold up.

07:34.607 --> 07:39.344
Did you just order French
champagne in French?

07:39.345 --> 07:42.047
Oui.

07:42.048 --> 07:43.314
We don't need menus.

07:43.315 --> 07:44.916
We'll have the beluga caviar

07:44.917 --> 07:46.885
and oysters Rockefeller to start.

07:46.886 --> 07:48.686
Excellent choice.

07:48.687 --> 07:50.088
Oh.

07:50.089 --> 07:51.823
Oysters and caviar?

07:53.159 --> 07:56.828
How do you say "hot sauce" in French?

07:56.829 --> 07:58.129
Sauce piquante.

07:58.130 --> 08:00.698
Well, I've got sauce piquante...

08:00.699 --> 08:03.001
in my bag.

08:03.002 --> 08:04.969
This space is such a lovely balance

08:04.970 --> 08:06.738
between traditional and modern.

08:06.739 --> 08:08.940
I always say there's nothing more elegant

08:08.941 --> 08:11.142
than marrying old with new.

08:11.143 --> 08:15.513
I couldn't agree more, Karen.

08:15.514 --> 08:18.216
I hope you stocked up on the blue pill.

08:19.318 --> 08:22.420
What in "The Green Mile"?

08:23.422 --> 08:24.556
Oh, excuse me one moment.

08:24.557 --> 08:25.857
I need to say hello to someone.

08:25.858 --> 08:28.259
- Okay.
- Give them our regards.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.296
So between the May-December
couple and the big guy,

08:31.297 --> 08:33.164
you must be ready to blow.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.365
Who, me?

08:34.366 --> 08:37.669
I hardly even noticed.

08:37.669 --> 08:39.236
Oh, God.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.774
You know, a less appropriate fellow

08:42.775 --> 08:44.193
would feel compelled to say

08:44.193 --> 08:45.410
those three gentlemen

08:45.411 --> 08:49.614
look like three newborn baby mole rats.

08:49.615 --> 08:51.816
I have no such impulse.

08:51.817 --> 08:53.251
Ashley, Marlon,

08:53.252 --> 08:54.219
meet Mark...

08:54.220 --> 08:55.487
- Taylor.
- Taylor.

08:55.488 --> 08:56.754
I've read all about you

08:56.755 --> 08:58.156
and the charity work that you do.

08:58.157 --> 08:59.557
It's very impressive.

08:59.558 --> 09:01.693
Well, I'll let you all get acquainted.

09:01.694 --> 09:03.194
Marcus.

09:03.195 --> 09:05.463
Are you active on the
charity scene as well?

09:05.464 --> 09:07.132
Ah, fairly active.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.701
Whenever somebody sends me
those cute little address labels,

09:09.702 --> 09:11.636
I always throw 'em a
little something-something.

09:13.472 --> 09:14.839
I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.041
I meant, are you on any committees?

09:17.042 --> 09:19.677
Ah, well, actually,
we're founding members

09:19.678 --> 09:22.247
of the Stephandre J. Noggle...

09:22.248 --> 09:25.750
Habitat for Homeless
Middle-Aged Black Men.

09:25.751 --> 09:27.185
I haven't heard of it.

09:27.186 --> 09:28.953
Really? You haven't heard our slogan?

09:28.954 --> 09:31.022
"A financially strapped Negro

09:31.023 --> 09:33.558
is a terrible thing to support."

09:33.559 --> 09:35.660
- Hmm.
- Yes, it's everywhere.

09:35.661 --> 09:37.562
In fact, we're having
a fundraiser next month.

09:37.563 --> 09:38.897
You should join.

09:38.898 --> 09:40.231
That would be great because, you know,

09:40.232 --> 09:42.834
if we can motivate just one

09:42.835 --> 09:45.270
homeless middle-aged black man

09:45.271 --> 09:47.205
to get a job

09:47.206 --> 09:51.142
or perhaps his own toilet paper,

09:51.143 --> 09:53.178
that would be something, wouldn't it?

09:53.179 --> 09:54.179
Sounds very special.

09:54.180 --> 09:55.546
Yes, it is.

09:58.117 --> 09:59.250
Thank you.

09:59.251 --> 10:00.749
Now I have to fake a fundraiser.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.086
Ah, that's the easy stuff.

10:02.087 --> 10:04.255
That ain't gonna be the
first thing you faked.

10:05.691 --> 10:08.793
Where are all these
bald-head dudes coming from?

10:10.095 --> 10:11.129
- Beluga.
- Mmm.

10:11.130 --> 10:12.964
You are in for a treat.

10:12.965 --> 10:14.999
Well, I'll try anything twice.

10:16.569 --> 10:17.569
- Okay.
- Ah-ah-ah.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.137
Use the mother-of-pearl spoon.

10:19.138 --> 10:21.039
Ooh.

10:23.776 --> 10:25.977
Okay.

10:25.978 --> 10:27.912
It's like the beach and crackers

10:27.913 --> 10:29.247
are popping off in my mouth.

10:30.282 --> 10:31.282
Excuse me, miss,

10:31.283 --> 10:32.584
I don't mean to interrupt,

10:32.585 --> 10:34.018
but I've got a bit of business

10:34.019 --> 10:35.687
with this Lil' Treblemaker.

10:39.892 --> 10:41.292
? The

10:41.293 --> 10:43.995
? Hallowed halls of Howell ?

10:43.996 --> 10:47.465
? Howl of how we'll win the day ?

10:47.466 --> 10:50.301
A gourmet who can sing,

10:50.302 --> 10:51.703
speak French,

10:51.704 --> 10:53.738
and look good in an ascot?

10:53.739 --> 10:55.240
Shoot, Stevie.

10:55.241 --> 10:58.576
You could fool around and catch it.

10:58.577 --> 10:59.811
What the hell am I saying?

10:59.812 --> 11:01.579
That caviar got me twisted.

11:01.580 --> 11:04.983
? The voices of our
bells will whisper ?

11:04.984 --> 11:07.952
? How we'll find the way ?

11:07.953 --> 11:09.887
? Howell ?

11:09.888 --> 11:13.358
- ? Oh, how we'll stay ?
- ? How we'll stay ?

11:17.196 --> 11:20.331
One of us is off.

11:20.332 --> 11:21.566
I think it's you.

11:23.102 --> 11:24.369
Our 10-year-old, Harper,

11:24.370 --> 11:26.471
was just issued his very first patent.

11:26.472 --> 11:28.406
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:28.407 --> 11:30.441
So you mentioned you have two children?

11:30.442 --> 11:32.143
Yes. Marley, our daughter,

11:32.144 --> 11:34.145
she's top of her class at Oakley.

11:34.146 --> 11:36.147
And Zack, our son, he's...

11:36.148 --> 11:38.116
- Uh, Zack, he's... he's...
- Uh...

11:38.117 --> 11:40.251
- He's... he's special.
- Yeah.

11:40.252 --> 11:41.886
- Quite special.
- Uh-huh.

11:41.887 --> 11:44.822
He's actually conducting
a scientific study

11:44.823 --> 11:48.593
where he traps inert gases
in cylindrical containers

11:48.594 --> 11:51.029
and observes their long-term potency

11:51.030 --> 11:54.465
and the effects on the nasal cavity.

11:54.466 --> 11:56.801
He's actually been tapped
for the space program.

11:56.802 --> 11:59.637
Yes, he's "inflatuated" with Uranus.

12:02.274 --> 12:04.575
- Uh, Marlon.
- Yes?

12:04.576 --> 12:06.110
Will you excuse us for a second?

12:06.111 --> 12:07.478
Will you join me, please?

12:07.479 --> 12:09.480
Oh, absolutely.

12:10.849 --> 12:13.351
Um, what are you doing?

12:13.352 --> 12:14.519
First a fake charity,

12:14.520 --> 12:16.454
and now Zack's gonna be an astronaut?

12:16.455 --> 12:19.390
Come on, tell me that
boy ain't a space cadet.

12:19.391 --> 12:20.958
This is important to you.

12:20.959 --> 12:23.795
I'm here to support you
and grow your business.

12:23.796 --> 12:25.930
I want to do this on my own.

12:25.931 --> 12:28.733
All right, fine. Fine.

12:28.734 --> 12:31.399
I'll just go find a smokers' lounge

12:31.400 --> 12:32.271
and some tobacco

12:32.272 --> 12:34.638
and a pipe that don't blow bubbles.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.043
Marlon, what I'm saying is,

12:38.044 --> 12:40.012
go home.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.085
Oh, Ashley, there you are.

12:46.086 --> 12:47.686
Mark was just telling us

12:47.687 --> 12:49.822
he's hosting a wine tasting this weekend.

12:49.823 --> 12:51.290
You and Marlon should come.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.825
And bring your aunt.

12:52.826 --> 12:55.361
Aunt Eunice?

12:55.362 --> 12:57.963
No, Diana Ross.

12:57.964 --> 12:59.498
Marlon said you'd be shy about it.

12:59.499 --> 13:01.133
Mm-hmm.

13:01.134 --> 13:02.601
What else did he say?

13:02.602 --> 13:05.237
That he helped create "Candy Crush."

13:05.238 --> 13:06.572
And that he once got in a fistfight

13:06.573 --> 13:08.540
with Morgan Freeman.

13:08.541 --> 13:09.875
Yeah...

13:09.876 --> 13:11.176
none of that is true.

13:11.177 --> 13:12.211
Here's the thing.

13:12.212 --> 13:14.012
Marlon and I are divorced,

13:14.014 --> 13:15.414
but we're still really good friends,

13:15.415 --> 13:16.749
and he just said all that stuff

13:16.750 --> 13:18.083
to help me get into this club.

13:18.084 --> 13:20.319
My life has been about pursuing my career

13:20.320 --> 13:22.955
and raising two kids, and
it's not very exciting,

13:22.956 --> 13:25.090
but I'm hoping that this place

13:25.091 --> 13:27.760
gives me a fresh start.

13:30.363 --> 13:32.698
Wonderful.

13:32.699 --> 13:34.700
I'm gonna get another drink.

13:34.701 --> 13:36.034
Would you excuse me?

13:36.036 --> 13:38.637
I think we'll join you.

13:41.274 --> 13:42.307
Wow.

13:42.308 --> 13:43.709
Guess I said the wrong thing.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.611
Oh, no, not at all.

13:45.612 --> 13:47.312
They're just not used to
people who are starting

13:47.313 --> 13:49.148
a new phase in their lives.

13:49.149 --> 13:51.750
The Avalon's more for
people who have already...

13:51.751 --> 13:53.485
arrived.

13:53.486 --> 13:55.220
Totally.

13:55.221 --> 13:56.922
That makes sense.

13:56.923 --> 13:57.890
If you'll excuse me.

13:57.891 --> 13:59.424
Of course.

14:01.227 --> 14:03.429
Oh, hell no.

14:05.838 --> 14:07.584
Hey, Ash.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.252
I thought you left.

14:09.253 --> 14:12.155
I was hiding behind
"Blind Side" over there.

14:12.156 --> 14:13.990
Listen, I heard what Karen said,

14:13.991 --> 14:15.325
and I don't think you should leave.

14:15.326 --> 14:17.460
Marlon, I showed them who I am,

14:17.461 --> 14:20.363
and they'd rather hang
out with Diana Ross' niece.

14:20.364 --> 14:22.397
Yeah, so would I.

14:22.398 --> 14:23.632
I mean, it's Diana Ross.

14:23.633 --> 14:25.100
She created a whole legion

14:25.101 --> 14:28.971
of little lovable light-skinned people.

14:28.972 --> 14:31.707
You could be one.

14:31.708 --> 14:34.076
It's true, medieval
doctors prescribed caviar

14:34.077 --> 14:36.345
to cure male impotence.

14:36.346 --> 14:38.313
Stevie, all this time,

14:38.314 --> 14:41.883
I had no idea you were so cultured.

14:41.884 --> 14:43.552
When you're ready. No rush.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.654
Oh, we're invited guests this evening.

14:45.655 --> 14:49.024
I believe everything is gratuit.

14:49.025 --> 14:50.993
Well, the hors d'oeuvres
are complimentary...

14:50.994 --> 14:52.661
- Uh-huh.
- But the items you ordered

14:52.662 --> 14:55.030
were off menu.

14:55.031 --> 14:57.432
Mm, mm.

14:57.433 --> 14:58.934
Mm.

14:58.935 --> 15:01.770
Um...

15:01.771 --> 15:04.806
I'll get the next one, s'il vous plaît.

15:04.807 --> 15:06.708
That's French for "please."

15:09.412 --> 15:13.115
I always knew your ass was trifling.

15:13.116 --> 15:15.650
And that's English for "trifling."

15:17.086 --> 15:19.488
How the hell you run up a bill like this?

15:19.489 --> 15:21.256
When given the opportunity,
I order the best.

15:21.257 --> 15:22.758
It's how I was raised.

15:22.759 --> 15:25.060
Well, this is how I was raised.

15:25.061 --> 15:27.396
When you can't pay, you run.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.798
Au revoir, sucker.

15:37.774 --> 15:39.474
If this is important to you,

15:39.475 --> 15:41.009
I don't understand why you're leaving.

15:41.010 --> 15:43.712
Marlon, because I'm not
like these people, okay?

15:43.713 --> 15:45.447
They all know who they are.

15:45.448 --> 15:46.648
They have their lives together.

15:46.649 --> 15:47.716
They've arrived.

15:47.717 --> 15:48.717
Girl, please.

15:48.718 --> 15:49.651
Look at all these people.

15:49.652 --> 15:50.886
They are fronting.

15:50.887 --> 15:51.887
Come on, listen.

15:51.888 --> 15:54.489
I've worn enough gold chains

15:54.490 --> 15:56.325
that turned my neck green

15:56.326 --> 15:58.226
to know fakes when I see 'em.

15:58.227 --> 15:59.294
Okay, come with me.

15:59.295 --> 16:01.697
Come here.

16:01.698 --> 16:02.698
Oh, Karen.

16:02.699 --> 16:04.032
- Karen.
- Oh.

16:04.033 --> 16:07.636
You know, your name fascinates me.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.071
However do you spell it?

16:09.072 --> 16:10.071
With a K.

16:10.073 --> 16:11.239
Mm.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.876
Is that with one R or two?

16:14.877 --> 16:17.079
Just one. Excuse me.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.816
- Yo, Karen!
- Yes?

16:20.817 --> 16:23.585
Oh, snap.

16:23.586 --> 16:26.755
Look who answers to "Karen."

16:26.756 --> 16:30.158
"Carr-en" does.

16:30.159 --> 16:33.662
Oh, Marcus, old chap.

16:33.663 --> 16:36.465
You say you're from
Connecticut. What part?

16:36.466 --> 16:38.633
- That would be Westport.
- Interesting.

16:38.634 --> 16:41.903
You know, I noticed a
very distinct wave pattern

16:41.904 --> 16:43.638
in your hair,

16:43.639 --> 16:45.374
one that can only be achieved

16:45.375 --> 16:47.142
by using pink lotion

16:47.143 --> 16:49.411
and what they call in the hood...

16:49.412 --> 16:51.646
a do-rag.

16:51.647 --> 16:52.727
I don't know what you mean.

16:54.150 --> 16:57.586
I see the indentation
along your forehead.

16:57.587 --> 17:00.989
How many days have
you woke up lightheaded

17:00.990 --> 17:02.858
because the tie was too tight?

17:02.859 --> 17:06.328
Yes, I know. I know.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.462
What did your mama tell you to do

17:07.463 --> 17:08.797
before she came home from work?

17:08.798 --> 17:11.066
Take the chicken out the freezer.

17:13.169 --> 17:14.803
Oh.

17:14.804 --> 17:18.240
So you're not from Westport, are you?

17:18.241 --> 17:19.941
I'm from Harlem, son.

17:19.942 --> 17:21.609
125 and St. Nick.

17:21.611 --> 17:23.178
Same place where Puffy
rapped about a chick

17:23.179 --> 17:25.213
named Tondalea, man.

17:25.214 --> 17:28.416
Damn, that felt good, son.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.518
Keep it real, dog.

17:29.519 --> 17:30.719
- Keeping it real.
- All day.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.654
- All day, every day.
- All day.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.456
- You know that.
- You know what I'm saying?

17:34.457 --> 17:37.793
My... my dude.

17:37.794 --> 17:40.529
And what can I say

17:40.530 --> 17:44.165
about Bobby and Suzy?

17:44.167 --> 17:46.401
Oh, the perfect parents

17:46.402 --> 17:47.702
with the perfect child.

17:47.703 --> 17:49.671
Never does anything wrong.

17:49.672 --> 17:53.175
- He sets things on fire!
- Damn.

17:53.176 --> 17:56.044
I'm sleeping with my secretary.

17:56.045 --> 17:59.815
You may have overshot that one, Bobby.

17:59.816 --> 18:00.949
You see?

18:00.950 --> 18:04.186
We are all faking the funk.

18:04.187 --> 18:05.754
Look at this hostess.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.656
She's probably putting
herself through school,

18:07.657 --> 18:09.691
working overtime here.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.760
Yeah, right.

18:11.761 --> 18:13.028
Watch this.

18:13.029 --> 18:14.696
Make it rain.

18:19.435 --> 18:22.537
A stripper!

18:23.773 --> 18:25.473
Even I...

18:25.475 --> 18:27.309
yes, I know you look at me and say,

18:27.310 --> 18:31.480
"Look at that smart, dapper rascal."

18:31.481 --> 18:34.516
But alas.

18:36.185 --> 18:38.753
This is nothing but a...

18:38.754 --> 18:42.424
leg from my dirty sweatpants.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.626
You're all a bunch of pretenders,

18:44.627 --> 18:46.628
but you know who's not a pretender?

18:46.629 --> 18:48.597
Ashley.

18:48.598 --> 18:51.299
She's the real deal,

18:51.300 --> 18:55.737
and you all are crazy if you
don't want her in your club.

18:55.738 --> 18:56.671
Come on, Ash.

18:56.672 --> 18:59.341
Let's get out of here.

18:59.342 --> 19:00.809
Ooh.

19:03.246 --> 19:07.082
Go ahead.

19:07.083 --> 19:11.820
You look like the last
three eggs in a carton.

19:16.618 --> 19:18.000
I can't believe you put

19:18.001 --> 19:19.635
that nasty sweatpant leg

19:19.636 --> 19:20.669
around your neck.

19:20.670 --> 19:23.672
I Febreze'd it first.

19:23.673 --> 19:25.340
Oh, Karen texted me.

19:25.341 --> 19:28.043
Apparently, they're still
considering my membership.

19:28.044 --> 19:30.746
Oh, wow. Nice.

19:30.747 --> 19:32.915
Yeah, Mark hit me up.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.417
Told me he wants to
get a spades game going.

19:37.287 --> 19:39.121
Thank you, Marlon.

19:39.122 --> 19:41.623
I know you were trying to help me.

19:41.624 --> 19:42.824
And I'll admit,

19:42.825 --> 19:45.661
as inappropriate as you can be,

19:45.662 --> 19:49.631
I admire your ability
to always be yourself.

19:49.632 --> 19:52.234
I guess if I was more appropriate,

19:52.235 --> 19:54.803
we'd have never gotten divorced.

19:54.804 --> 19:56.972
Marlon, if you were more appropriate,

19:56.973 --> 20:00.142
we never would have gotten married.

20:00.143 --> 20:02.044
Sometimes I just want to hug you.

20:03.246 --> 20:07.983
You say all the right things, boo.

20:07.984 --> 20:09.985
You're so silly.

20:09.986 --> 20:13.021
Hey, so what happened to you two?

20:13.022 --> 20:15.157
We dined and dashed.

20:15.158 --> 20:16.925
I think Yvette and I

20:16.926 --> 20:18.827
learned a little something
about each other tonight.

20:18.828 --> 20:20.829
Yeah, that your ass is broke

20:20.830 --> 20:23.098
in any language.

20:23.099 --> 20:26.034
Well, either way, it felt
good to stick it to "The Man."

20:26.035 --> 20:27.869
Yeah, well, sorry, Bonnie and Clyde,

20:27.870 --> 20:29.204
the Avalon called.

20:29.205 --> 20:31.239
Seems like "The Man"

20:31.240 --> 20:34.041
has your IDs at coat check.

20:35.377 --> 20:37.379
You know what?

20:37.380 --> 20:39.881
- It was your idea to dine and dash.
- You broke-ass... shut up!

20:39.882 --> 20:40.983
Get out.

20:40.984 --> 20:43.151
Get out of Ashley's house.

20:43.152 --> 20:44.519
Get out!

20:44.520 --> 20:46.088
Can you believe that?

20:46.089 --> 20:48.190
Hey, we ain't aiding
and abetting no fugitive.

20:48.191 --> 20:51.026
You get your ass out too.

20:51.027 --> 20:52.394
Ashley.

20:52.395 --> 20:53.573
I got two kids.

20:53.574 --> 20:55.605
