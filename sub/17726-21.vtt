00:02.036 --> 00:04.438
- Previously this season on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:05.173 --> 00:07.108
- These lovers bestow a request,

00:07.141 --> 00:11.179
to ordain their
forthcoming nuptial.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.114
- I didn't want to ask
Ariana to be a bridesmaid

00:13.147 --> 00:14.148
for a f---ing reason.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.384
- I think I want you
to officially be a groomsman.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.319
- I'm also sitting there
with someone pretending

00:18.352 --> 00:21.122
that they haven't had
a married boyfriend.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.124
- Lala, you knew 'em for
about five f---ing minutes--

00:23.157 --> 00:24.458
- You've said stuff
about her too, though.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.294
- You saying that is
defending her right there.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.262
- I don't really give
a f---.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.065
- Everything's okay
Scheana Shay land?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.433
- Um...

00:32.466 --> 00:34.535
She's my date tonight.
My husband's in the studio.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.537
Nothing else to do.
Shay's in the studio all night.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.107
Last night texting him,
"Hey, it's three A.M.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.209
You okay?"
It scares me.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.510
- I think he's working
really hard on something,

00:42.543 --> 00:43.511
but I don't think
it's their relationship.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.114
He doesn't come home at night.
- Are you sure?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.681
What about you?
Are you gonna marry him?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.350
- [laughing] No.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.385
- Check back with me
in five years' time.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.386
- You don't want to work,
that's fine,

00:52.420 --> 00:54.088
but when I come home
I'd like to have a sandwich.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.689
- You've taken her
out of Kentucky.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.558
You've tooken her away
from all of her family.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.059
- When you're dating
a girl from the south,

01:00.294 --> 01:02.163
they expect you to have kids
and marriage by 22 years old.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.099
- What about if we did
a new, young restaurant

01:05.133 --> 01:07.135
and had a couple
of young partners?

01:07.168 --> 01:10.104
- Cheers to marriage being
the best new thing in my life.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.506
- Oh, my God!
Talk to me in a year.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.409
- I have to deal with her
going to the f---ing dark side.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.646
I wish Katie just f---ed a guy.
I wish Katie had f---ed a guy.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.480
- Seriously?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.183
- The way you've been
behaving lately,

01:22.216 --> 01:25.186
I'm concerned of taking
responsibility

01:25.219 --> 01:27.221
to ordain a marriage...

01:27.255 --> 01:28.589
- We said we were
gonna be unflappable,

01:28.622 --> 01:30.724
and we were so flappable.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.195
Let's not be assholes anymore.

01:34.228 --> 01:38.432
- Schwartzy, Katie,
I am happy and honored now

01:38.466 --> 01:40.201
to officiate your wedding.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.068
- Aww.
- Yeah.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.903
- Me and Jax,
we wanted to give you

01:42.936 --> 01:44.338
your wedding present
a little early.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.174
- What the f---.
My God!

01:46.207 --> 01:47.341
- Hey, hey.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.343
- You can't have a wedding
without your brothers here.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.611
Come on, now.
- Oh, my God, man.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.613
- Happy wedding day!
Happy wedding day!

01:52.646 --> 01:53.914
- Yay!

01:53.947 --> 01:57.518

not to cry just yet.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.496
- I mean, I knew
she was gonna look good.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.865
I just didn't know
she would look this good.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.468
- Friends, family,
and loved ones,

03:54.502 --> 03:56.504
I want to welcome
all of you today

03:56.537 --> 03:59.507
to celebrate one of life's
greatest moments.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.741
We are all here tonight,

04:00.774 --> 04:04.878
united by the love
of Katie and Schwartzy.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.647
[laughter]

04:06.680 --> 04:08.582
I've been married
for over 34 years.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.751
I have some suggestions
for the two of you.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.353
- Yes, please.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.354
- Run.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.788
[laughter]

04:14.822 --> 04:16.824
You are never too old
to hold hands,

04:16.857 --> 04:19.760
and it's important
that you say "I love you"

04:19.793 --> 04:20.894
at least once a day.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.531
Never go to sleep angry.

04:23.564 --> 04:27.067
Never text with tequila.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.502
Support each other

04:28.536 --> 04:30.704
when difficult decisions
must be made.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.772
And respect each other

04:31.805 --> 04:34.442
and each other's opinions.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.445
- This is the most beautiful
wedding I've ever seen,

04:37.478 --> 04:40.781
and seeing Katie and Schwartz
so in love and happy,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.784
just everything
about it is perfect.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.718
- Tom.
- Yes?

04:44.752 --> 04:47.388
- Bubba, would you like
to say your vows?

04:47.421 --> 04:49.923
- Yes.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.859
Actually, you know what,
I don't need these.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.496
[crowd oohs]
I don't need these.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.765
Actually, I do need 'em.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.799
[laughter]

04:58.832 --> 05:01.635
I do.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.904
Okay, um...

05:03.937 --> 05:05.373
Oh, man.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.874
So moving west
to pursue my dreams

05:06.907 --> 05:09.877
was one of the most
exciting decisions of my life.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.679
But with a fledging
bank account

05:11.712 --> 05:14.815
and a leaky air mattress,

05:14.848 --> 05:18.118
I had resigned to being
L.A.'s least eligible bachelor.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.553
[laughter]

05:19.587 --> 05:21.689
But with my spirit high
and my mojo low,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.857
I was introduced
to Katie Maloney,

05:23.891 --> 05:25.426
via Kristen Doute.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.860
Shout-out to Kristen Doute.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.830
- When I introduced them,
Tom literally would chase her

05:29.863 --> 05:31.699
and he would just, like,
text me and he's like,

05:31.732 --> 05:33.434
"I don't know if she likes me
and I don't know--

05:33.467 --> 05:35.869
I'm afraid she won't date me,"
and all this sh--.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.707
And I'm like,
"You are obsessed with her."

05:39.740 --> 05:41.842
- And I'd been told
that romance in L.A.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.711
was fleeting
and often short-lived,

05:43.744 --> 05:45.613
often lasting only one night,

05:45.646 --> 05:47.881
according to my roommate,
Jax Taylor.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
[laughter]

05:49.783 --> 05:53.721
It has been a roller coaster
of a relationship,

05:53.754 --> 05:56.857
highs and lows,
but six years later

05:56.890 --> 05:59.760
I honestly can't imagine not
waking up to you every morning.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.898
We almost--
[chuckles]

06:04.932 --> 06:06.700
Oh.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.537
We almost became like another
relationship statistic,

06:09.570 --> 06:11.605
another failed romance
in La La Land,

06:11.639 --> 06:13.741
but we persevered
and we worked really hard,

06:13.774 --> 06:16.777
and I feel like we
practically had to tear down

06:16.810 --> 06:18.912
our relationship
in order to rebuild it.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.883
But...yeah.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.818
As I stand here today
in this moment

06:24.852 --> 06:27.755
before my dream girl,
my beautiful bride-to-be,

06:27.788 --> 06:30.023
before my friends and family,
who I love dearly,

06:30.057 --> 06:32.960
I really do,

06:32.993 --> 06:35.529
I can honestly say
from the bottom of my heart

06:35.563 --> 06:39.567
that I have never loved you more
than this moment right here.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.769
And, um...yeah.

06:41.802 --> 06:45.506
[applause]

06:45.539 --> 06:48.676
- All I can think of is
how much I love Schwartz,

06:48.709 --> 06:49.910
how much I love Katie,

06:49.943 --> 06:51.745
how much I love love.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.847
- Oh, Tom.
- Hi.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.549
- My Bubba Love.
- Hi.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.519
- Six years ago I met you,

06:58.552 --> 07:00.488
and I knew from that minute

07:00.521 --> 07:01.989
that you were put
on this planet for me.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.457
- Ohh.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.958
- And when you met my family

07:04.992 --> 07:07.227
and you treated them like
they were your own,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.731
that's when I knew
that I had to marry you.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.232
Ultimatum or no ultimatum.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.634
[laughter]

07:13.667 --> 07:15.903
In six years,
it's been a lot of love,

07:15.936 --> 07:19.239
a lot of laughter,
a lot of tears.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.574
- Yeah.

07:21.609 --> 07:22.610
- At times I definitely thought
my world would end

07:23.677 --> 07:24.878
because I can't imagine
my world without you in it.

07:24.912 --> 07:25.879
- Oh.

07:26.814 --> 07:27.447
- I didn't want
to know what that was like,

07:28.582 --> 07:30.684
but we did
persevere together.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.520
And because of that,
it showed me

07:32.553 --> 07:34.588
that some of life's biggest
challenges that are to come,

07:34.622 --> 07:35.723
that we will be able
to do them together

07:35.756 --> 07:38.692
because it is our commitment
to one another and our love

07:38.726 --> 07:39.960
that has carried us through.

07:39.993 --> 07:40.961
- Yeah.

07:41.962 --> 07:42.863
- I can't wait for
the rest of my life with you.

07:42.896 --> 07:43.964
- Wow.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.833
[applause]

07:50.538 --> 07:53.040
- I'm not crying.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.842
Sandoval's a crier, not me.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.878
- Tom, please place the ring
on Katie's finger.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.881
[gentle music]

08:00.914 --> 08:02.049
*

08:02.082 --> 08:04.985
- This ring is not on a string.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.120
- I know it's not the engagement
ring that you deserve.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.956
- Putting a ring on a string

08:08.989 --> 08:10.958
and putting it around my neck,
saying, "I love you..."

08:10.991 --> 08:12.025
- It's not a string.
It's a gold necklace.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.794
- "I'm committed to you,"
is not really

08:14.662 --> 08:15.863
what a girl pushing 30
wants to hear.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.799
This is the real deal.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.601
This is my happy ending.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.636
- I, Katie, take thee, Tom.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.004
- I, Katie, take thee, Tom.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
- To be my husband.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.874
- To be my husband.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.676
- In sickness and in health.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.743
- In sickness and in health.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.579
- For richer and richer.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.813
- For richer and richer.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.582
[laughter]

08:34.615 --> 08:37.017
- Tom, do you take Katie
to be your wife?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.887
Do you promise to love,
honor, cherish and protect her,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.889
forsaking all others,

08:41.922 --> 08:44.992
and holding only unto her
forevermore.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.628
- I do.

08:47.661 --> 08:51.131
- Katie, do you take Tom
to be your husband?

08:51.164 --> 08:56.604
Do you promise to love, cherish
and protect him forevermore?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.005

08:58.038 --> 09:00.641

'tis with a full heart

09:00.674 --> 09:03.010
and much pride and love

09:03.043 --> 09:06.046

husband and wife.

- Tom and I are married
as f---.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.095
Check that out.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.932
- It is my pleasure
to introduce you

09:24.965 --> 09:26.934
to Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.969

Got married.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.913
It feels f---ing good.

- Listen, I don't think things
are going well for us anymore.

- * I know

09:56.897 --> 09:59.833

it's not precise *

[cheers and applause]

10:01.434 --> 10:07.074
*

10:07.107 --> 10:09.176
- We've had many, many
restaurants,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.712
and I haven't seen
many groups of people

10:11.745 --> 10:12.713
like this group.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.016
They fight each other,

they even sleep
with each other sometimes,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.388
and they all have a fantastic
way of working things out.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.256
None of it makes
any sense to me,

10:23.290 --> 10:25.292
but it sure makes
sense to them.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.660
- Ladies and gentlemen,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.663
welcome for the very first time
as husband and wife,

10:29.697 --> 10:31.231
Tom and Katie.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.433
[wild cheering]

10:33.466 --> 10:36.403
*

10:36.436 --> 10:38.706
- The Schwartzes have arrived.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.373
[cheering]

10:41.775 --> 10:43.410
- * Wonderful

10:43.443 --> 10:48.148
* Is what I call you,
wonderful *

10:48.181 --> 10:52.385
* Wonderful
is what you are to me *

10:52.419 --> 10:55.088
- People use to think
that Jax and I

10:55.122 --> 10:57.324
were the glue
that held this group together,

10:57.357 --> 11:01.328
but really Katie and Schwartz
hold this group together.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.864
Jax and I were just the glue
that everybody sniffed.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.167
- * So full of all

11:07.200 --> 11:10.437
* The love you've given me

11:10.470 --> 11:14.441
* Wonderful is how
it's gonna be *

11:14.474 --> 11:16.309
[cheers and applause]

11:23.316 --> 11:25.418
[upbeat music]

11:25.452 --> 11:27.420
- We have to go eat
so everyone else can.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.089
- Bridesmaids.
all: Ohh-ah-ah!

11:33.293 --> 11:34.795
- Give him drinks,
give him drinks.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.463
Give him a drink.
give him a drink.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.398
Who doesn't think
about getting married

11:38.431 --> 11:40.200
when they're
at someone else's wedding?

11:40.233 --> 11:43.336
Of course I'm, like, picturing,
what do I want?

11:43.370 --> 11:46.206
Is it gonna happen?
When is it gonna happen?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.707
- I love you.

11:48.909 --> 11:49.342
- I'm ready for Carter
to put a real one on it,

11:50.343 --> 11:51.711
so I can stop wearing
my fake engagement ring.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.514
- Chicken marsala.
- Think I want that salmon.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.449
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

11:56.483 --> 12:00.788
- Peter, can you get Stassi
to get my dinner for me?

12:00.821 --> 12:01.922
- I got this covered.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.356
- There's a lot
of waitresses around.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.125
One of them can get me dinner.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.359
- Where should I sit?
By the bride?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.833
- Stassi, Lisa wants you
to get her food

12:12.866 --> 12:15.235
and serve on her
one last time.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.138
Seriously.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.407
- I feel like I'm the master
at serving Lisa.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.942
I've served her
hundreds of dinners.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.310
What's one more?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.913
- Can I do chicken,
mashed potatoes and salmon?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.347
I have to give her butter.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.515
- Da-da-da.
There you go.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.417
- Me and Peter
together forever.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.552
- Oh, Jesus.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.387
- Hell yeah!
- Tom.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.256
- What?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.524
*

12:37.557 --> 12:39.960
- Oh, yeah.
- Dinner is served.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.428
I just felt like
I wanted to get you

12:41.461 --> 12:43.330
a little bit
of everything.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.298
- Thank you, Stassi.
- You're very welcome.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.200
- Did she spit in it?
- No, no.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.237
I was with her
the entire time.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.339
- Make out, make out!
- Yeah!

12:52.372 --> 12:54.374
[cheering]
- Ah, my tooth.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.276
- Dude, I already ripped
the pants right in the crotch.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.845
Look at that.
I need some dick room.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.880
- So these came like this
and then I said,

12:59.913 --> 13:03.216
I need you to put in, like,
an extra panel of--

13:03.250 --> 13:04.818
like, for dick room,
you know what I mean?

13:04.852 --> 13:05.919
- Yeah, dude.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.256
- Lisa, hey, I wanted
to tell you real quick--

13:09.289 --> 13:11.424
- Come here.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.494
- Lisa, today was amazing.
You did so well today, like--

13:14.527 --> 13:15.562
- Oh, thank you.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.297
I adore them both.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.366
I hope that
they have the strength

13:19.399 --> 13:22.335
to fight for, you know,
their relationship.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.470
What about you?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.571
You want to marry Ariana,
don't you?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.306
- Oh, my gosh.
- I know you do.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.375
What are you gonna do?
- Well, I've never asked her.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.977
- You've never asked her?
- No.

13:30.010 --> 13:33.246
- How do you know she's
definitely gonna say no?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.615
I was actually like
Ariana when I was younger.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.617
I didn't want to get married
or have children,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.587
but then things change,
and it certainly turned out

13:40.620 --> 13:42.422
to be the best thing
I ever did.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.425
It's time for you guys, though,
to grow up, tough, isn't it?

13:45.458 --> 13:49.229
You've been the best bartender
we've ever had at Sur.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.331
- Thank you, Lisa.
- No, but you have.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.933
We've got new premises,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.002
and I normally don't like
having partners,

13:55.035 --> 13:56.937
'cause in the 33 restaurants
we've had,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.538
we've only done it once,

13:58.571 --> 14:01.608
but maybe you could think
about that.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.477
- Partnering up with you?
- Yeah.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.346
- What the f---?

14:06.379 --> 14:09.616
- That would be a time for you
to take another step.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.451
- I don't even know
what to say.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.452
- You don't have
to say anything.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.520
Just think about it.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.024
- For Lisa Vanderpump
to look at me

14:17.057 --> 14:19.359
as more than a bartender
that works for her,

14:19.392 --> 14:21.929
but actually a potential
business partner,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.363
boom!

14:23.396 --> 14:24.664
- Hold on,
I'm gonna go feed the boys.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.333
- Okay.
- Hey, guys!

14:26.366 --> 14:27.567
- I'm gonna go--
- So in Denmark

14:28.801 --> 14:30.037
we have a tradition that when
the groom leaves his bride,

14:31.004 --> 14:32.272
all the men can come up
and kiss the bride.

14:33.240 --> 14:33.974
Come up and give Katie
a kiss on the cheek.

14:34.774 --> 14:35.976
I think you should.
- Oh, yeah!

14:36.009 --> 14:37.277
- Yeah!
- Kiss her!

14:37.310 --> 14:39.679
[cheering]

14:39.712 --> 14:43.650
- I have a new appreciation
Danish traditions.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.918
- The best,
you know what I mean?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.486
- Yeah, give Katie a kiss.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.121
It's a Denmark tradition.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.058
- I feel like this is
the beginning of a porno.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.027
- You guys hear me good?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.463
- Everybody, yeah.
Speech time.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.331
- All right, Tommy.
- 'Sup, Billy?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.400
- I love you.
- I love you too, bro.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.701
- You're a great brother,
and a good man.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.403
- Thanks, dude.
- I think you and Katie

15:03.436 --> 15:04.571
will have beautiful kids
together.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.672
'Cause you know why?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.407
'Cause you guys
are both beautiful.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.942
[laughter]
You know, I love you, man.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.544
- I love you too, dude.
Thanks, Billy.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.947
[cheers and applause]

15:13.981 --> 15:15.415
- Burt!

15:15.448 --> 15:16.950
- I just want to say

15:16.984 --> 15:18.485
I'm blessed
to be in the presence

15:18.518 --> 15:20.020
of all you fine individuals.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.956
Tom Sandoval,
didn't happen without you, sir.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.992
- Dude, yeah.
- And Jax.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.494
And also I want to say
God bless Katie and Tommy.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.496
I love you guys.
- Thank you.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.664
[cheers and applause]

15:31.698 --> 15:34.101
- Jax and Sandoval surprising me

15:34.134 --> 15:36.436
by bringing my brothers
to my wedding

15:36.469 --> 15:40.573
is the best wedding gift
I could have ever asked for.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.175
- Oh, Billy, wait.
You already went.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.410
- Tom.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.444
- I'm not gonna
embarrass anyone.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.346
Don't worry.
- Hey, Billy, you already went.

15:47.314 --> 15:47.680
- Are you third one?
- No, I already spoke.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.482
- So where's the third one?
- Where's the third one?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.119
- For some people
one speech is enough.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.655
For other people,
like my brother Billy...

15:55.688 --> 15:57.457
- I just wish the best for Tom.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.691
You're a cool-ass motherf---er.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.028
[laughter]

16:01.061 --> 16:02.729
Tom's the pimp, all right?

16:02.762 --> 16:05.032
No, that's the wrong--
that's the wrong term.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.366
- Billy, come here, hug me.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.467
- That's what he used to be.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.436
- Jesus, Billy, come here.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.738
Old Billy Two Speech.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.373
Billy, come here!

16:13.406 --> 16:15.108
[applause]

16:15.142 --> 16:18.578
- You know, I'm just not
really a fan of Schwartz.

16:18.611 --> 16:22.482
Like, I don't know,
he just rubbed me the wrong way.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.152
Said nobody ever.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.686
[laughter]
- Ohhh.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.156
- I've never met
a single person

16:29.189 --> 16:31.158
who's spent
two seconds with you

16:31.191 --> 16:33.493
that doesn't just
f---ing love you, man.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.628
You're an amazing guy, dude.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.764
I guess let's cheers
to Tom and Katie.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.466
- All right.
- Cheers!

16:39.499 --> 16:42.602
- Thank you.
Thanks, Tom.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.637
- They love each other
so much.

16:44.671 --> 16:49.109
- Katie and Schwartz
are the most generous couple.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.578
They've taken care of me
a million times.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.414
- Stas? Stas?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.548
Ohh.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.617
[somber music]

16:57.650 --> 16:58.785
It's been a very special thing

16:58.818 --> 17:00.753
to be able to watch
two best friends

17:00.787 --> 17:03.190
commit their lives
to each other.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.491
It's really f---ing cool.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.426
- Yeah.
[cheering]

17:09.462 --> 17:11.531
- If you would have told me
two years ago

17:11.564 --> 17:13.600
that Stassi Schroeder
would be at our wedding

17:13.633 --> 17:15.535
giving a toast,
I would have told you

17:15.568 --> 17:17.204
you're out of your
f---ing mind.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.639
Shut the f--- up, Stassi.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.276
But now our wedding would
feel incomplete without her.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.446
- You guys, thank you for
the f---ing awesome speeches.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.447
[cheers and applause]

17:27.480 --> 17:28.748
I love you.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.517
- Thank you, everyone.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.753
Harbor Party, let's do it.
Yeah!

17:33.786 --> 17:36.723
[cheers and applause]

17:36.756 --> 17:38.725
F--- yes.
- All right, guys.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.694
- * It's time to let your hair
down and have a good time *

17:41.728 --> 17:44.097
- Harbor Party calls
themselves a yacht rock band.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
I don't know if it's because
this is the type of music

17:46.166 --> 17:47.600
you would listen to
on a yacht,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.302
or just because
they like to dress up

17:49.336 --> 17:51.304
as if they're on a boat.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.805
- [vocalizing]

17:54.174 --> 17:55.708
- It's just music you can
dance to for every generation.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.809
What more do you need?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.478
- * It's about damn time

17:58.511 --> 18:01.114
- Come on, baby.
Cheers, guys.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.683
*

18:03.716 --> 18:07.220
- Hey, bow tie's coming off.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.722
- * To party all night

18:09.756 --> 18:11.591
[cheers and applause]

18:11.624 --> 18:14.594
- This breeze feels so good.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.329
- [sighs]
- It's hot.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.298
Are you having fun?

18:18.331 --> 18:20.300
- Mm.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.170
Listen, um...

18:24.271 --> 18:27.540
I don't think things are
going well for us anymore.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.641
- Huh?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.510
- I'm just gonna say it.

18:34.547 --> 18:39.519
- I never felt anyone worthy
of reproducing with...

18:39.552 --> 18:41.354
- What are you saying?

18:46.493 --> 18:48.161
- * Can you hear the song

18:48.861 --> 18:49.296
* It's a beautiful woman

18:49.996 --> 18:51.431
* And as some would say...

18:51.464 --> 18:54.267
*

18:54.301 --> 18:57.170
- Listen, um...

18:58.371 --> 19:01.408
I don't think things are
going well for us anymore.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.609
- Huh?

19:02.642 --> 19:07.180
- I just don't think things
are going well with us anymore.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.482
I love you as a person,

19:09.516 --> 19:12.452
but I just think...

19:12.485 --> 19:13.453
- What?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.621
- I'm kidding!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.423
- Oh, my God,
I was about to smack you.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.491
- Yeah, I know, it was hurting
my feelings even saying it.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.826
I'm sorry.
- Don't do that to me ever.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.561
- Okay, I love you.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.663
- He was this close to getting
his dick chopped off

19:23.696 --> 19:25.265
and fed to the chickens.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.200
You had me tearing up, Jax.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.435
- Oh, sweetheart,
you know there's nothing

19:28.468 --> 19:29.602
that would ever happen.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.505
That being said,
I want you to know

19:32.539 --> 19:35.508
marriage for us
is gonna happen.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.277
[upbeat music]

19:37.310 --> 19:40.380
Now it's just a matter
of when, how, whatever.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.515
But I just want you to know
that there is--

19:42.549 --> 19:45.285
there is light
at the end of the tunnel.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.220
You mean the world to me, and
I love you more than anything.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.455
- You make me cry.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.556
- No, I don't want
to make you cry.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.790
- In a good way now.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.593
- I just want to let you know
that I love you to death.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.328
Listen, I love
Brittany very much,

19:56.496 --> 19:57.230
and if I'm gonna get married,
it's definitely gonna be her.

19:58.298 --> 19:58.798
She's the best thing that's
ever happened to me,

19:59.766 --> 20:01.568
and when the time comes
she will be the one.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.702
All right, let's go
dance with everybody.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.238
- Okay.

20:05.272 --> 20:10.477
*

20:10.510 --> 20:11.711
- Let me see.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.583
*

20:16.616 --> 20:18.318
- When do you think
you'll have a baby?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.686
- When?
Oh, my God.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.853
- A couple of years?
- Yeah.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.555
- Let's get everything
in order...

20:22.589 --> 20:25.358
- I can't be
a pregnant waitress.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.827
- I love weddings.
- You should have one!

20:27.860 --> 20:28.961
- Can I just throw a party
without getting married?

20:28.995 --> 20:31.264
- You can wear the suit
and Tom can wear the dress.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.266
I mean, he kills in a dress.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.867
- Do you want to f---?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.303
- I said to him earlier today,

20:37.069 --> 20:37.637
"If we ever get married,
can I wear the suit?"

20:38.805 --> 20:39.339
And he goes wait, "Does that
mean I have to wear a dress?"

20:40.206 --> 20:42.275
- So you're saying
there's a chance.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.611
- So I'm saying
there's a chance.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.280
I'll be back.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.552
- That was everything.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.886
That was everything.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.722
- A mosquito just
flew up my nose.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.889
- Oh, no!
- He's gone.

20:56.923 --> 20:57.924
- You all right?
- Yeah, he's gone.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.860
I could feel his little legs
in my, like, nostril.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.595
- To Katie and Tom!

21:02.629 --> 21:05.498
- Schwartzes!

21:05.532 --> 21:07.734
- Schwartzes!

21:07.767 --> 21:08.801
- So I have
to tell you something.

21:08.835 --> 21:12.405
Lisa, she just bought a place,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.707
and she wants
to be partners.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.445
[chuckles]
I know, right?

21:18.478 --> 21:19.812
- That's so cool.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.881
- She just told me.
I didn't even know what to say.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.417
- Oh, my God.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.819
- I've been a bartender
for ten years.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.389
I've always wanted
to open up my own bar.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.692
- It's really cool to see Tom
actually have something

21:32.725 --> 21:35.462
in his future
outside of being at Sur.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.765
- I mean, Lisa and Ken,
they've been together for what?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.932
- Thirty--longer than
you've been alive.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.468
- Exactly.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.436
- Longer than I've been alive.
- And look at them.

21:44.337 --> 21:44.871
They're, like--
they're always so happy.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.406
They're always so supportive.

21:47.239 --> 21:47.907
- Their priority
is always each other.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.809
- I think of you
the same way.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.880
But, like, I've never
felt anyone worthy

21:53.913 --> 21:56.849
of reproducing with--
you know what I mean?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.885
Like, having a kid with.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.454
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm sorry.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.556
- What are you saying?

22:03.590 --> 22:05.958
- Until I met you, like, I--

22:05.992 --> 22:07.694
I never really--

22:07.727 --> 22:10.897
kids was, like,
so 20 years from now.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.866
I imagine myself
being a day one day.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.868
I would love to have
a little Tom or Ariana

22:15.902 --> 22:18.004
running around.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.373
I'd love that little rug rat.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.976
Listen, I'm not gonna
propose to you,

22:24.010 --> 22:24.911
so don't think that.

22:25.912 --> 22:26.879
- I would never think
that you would be so tacky

22:28.481 --> 22:30.483
as to propose to anyone
at someone else's wedding.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.386
- But, like, I gotta be real.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.889
You wanna get married
at some point?

22:36.923 --> 22:39.792
- What the f---?

22:39.826 --> 22:41.894
I don't know.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.696
I just love Tom so much,

22:43.730 --> 22:46.833
but I don't know
if I wanna get married.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.603
And what he says to me
is not changing my mind,

22:50.637 --> 22:52.472
but I'm not
gonna shoot him down,

22:52.505 --> 22:53.906
not right now at least.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.942
- I don't know
what's wrong with me.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.979
- There's nothing wrong
with you.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.782
- How do you feel about cake?
Can we do cake?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.517
- Tom.
- What do I do?

23:04.551 --> 23:06.819
- We're gonna cut
the bottom layer together.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.421
- Fix my hair.
- The bottom--

23:08.455 --> 23:09.789
Wait, no, Tom,
the bottom layer.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.825
- I think every wedding
I've been to, they go like this.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.894
- Ohh.
[laughter]

23:16.696 --> 23:18.798
[cheering]

23:18.831 --> 23:20.533
- Get back in there!

23:20.567 --> 23:22.669
- Not on the shirt.
Not on the shirt.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.837
- Lick it off her nose.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.474
- I don't--I don't--
I'm not a nose guy.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.442
- It's your wedding day,
you lick it off.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.743
Whether you're
a nose guy or not.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.911
- Don't put it in my face.
- I'm not going to.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.880
Taste this.
- Oh, it's good.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.616
- Me personally, I would have
stuck her foot in the cake.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.519
[cheering]

23:39.552 --> 23:42.522
[upbeat music]

23:42.555 --> 23:47.527
*

23:47.560 --> 23:48.995
What about this?
Can I do this?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.863
- No!

23:50.897 --> 23:51.998
Nathalie!

23:52.031 --> 23:55.001
- Oh, gosh, sorry.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.070
- Back it up, back it up.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.808
Why are you skinnier than
anybody I ever am around?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.946
- Well, I mean,
let's just test it.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.782
Some day.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.818
- I really don't know
where Shay is.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.654
I've barely seen him
since the ceremony.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.855
He's just MIA.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.658
- So did you think about
what I said or is--

24:18.691 --> 24:20.593
- First of all,
I'm just so honored--

24:20.627 --> 24:21.894
- I don't want you
to be honored.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.863
Really, I think that
you could do a great job.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.532
- I know I would.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.633
- What I was thinking is

24:27.634 --> 24:29.636
a bar and a restaurant
always needs a great face,

24:29.669 --> 24:32.839
and somebody who's loveable
and amenable.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.007
So what about Schwartzy?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.843
He could be, like,
the face of it.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.745
I mean, he would love it.
- I would love it, too.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.614
- When I met Guillermo,
I literally said to him,

24:41.648 --> 24:42.882
"Do you want to be partners?"

24:42.915 --> 24:44.951
He's got this likeability,

24:44.984 --> 24:49.889
and Schwartzy has that same
joie de vivre.

24:49.922 --> 24:50.990
- I'm gonna give you a kiss.
Mwah.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.894
- As a frontman,
Schwartzy would do a great job.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.963
And then you could deal
with all the crap

24:56.996 --> 24:58.765
that I've had to deal with.

24:58.798 --> 24:59.999
You know what we'd call it?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.000
- What?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.001
- Tom Tom.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.135
- What?

25:04.136 --> 25:04.937
- Do you think that
would be the funniest thing?

25:05.872 --> 25:06.539
- Are you kidding me?
- Don't you think?

25:07.339 --> 25:08.040
- Lisa!
- It would be so much fun.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.042
- Tom Tom?

25:10.076 --> 25:11.678
Schwartz.
Schwartz, come here.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.079
- He's probably not sober.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.148
You do not look like
you have--yes.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.785
- That was the first time I've
only kissed you on one cheek.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.119
I like the one cheek.
It's more of a Miami thing.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.154
- How are you doing?
- I feel good.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.056
I'm buzzed,
but I'm not drunk.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.158
- We were talking
about something.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.894
This is gonna be
a surprise to you.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.862
We've taken on
another premises

25:29.896 --> 25:31.631
just around the corner
from Sur,

25:31.664 --> 25:34.033
and we were talking to Tom

25:34.066 --> 25:37.103
about asking him to get
involved as a partner with us.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.038
- This?
You give him an inch,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.940
he's gonna take--he's gonna
want creative control.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.943
- Schwartz, it's not about me.
Listen, it's about you.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.945
- Oh, me?
- Maybe both of you.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.814
- You don't want me
behind the bar, right?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.682
- No. Definitely not.
- No.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.084
- A bar always needs a face,

25:52.118 --> 25:53.953
someone to greet them,

25:53.986 --> 25:57.089
and we were thinking
of calling it Tom Tom.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.725
- What?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.162
- You don't want
any new friends.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.897
- I'm saying I'm doing
the best that I can.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.198
- We all are.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.143
- * So glad we danced

26:17.476 --> 26:18.377
*

26:18.410 --> 26:21.047
- A bar always needs a face,

26:21.080 --> 26:23.683
and we were thinking
of calling it Tom Tom.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.118
- What?

26:26.152 --> 26:28.721
No, I can't.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.057
- Are you serious?
- I can't let you do that.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.324
If it fails, it's on us.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.226
- Listen, I've never done
anything that fails.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.728
We're not gonna do that now.
- Yeah, exactly.

26:35.762 --> 26:36.829
- That's too much
pressure on me.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.397
- No, Schwartz,
stop for a second.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.232
It's like one little whiff
of responsibility,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.034
and he's just like, "No."

26:42.068 --> 26:44.804
- Listen, you just
enjoy your wedding.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.406
I'm going back to L.A.
tomorrow morning,

26:47.439 --> 26:49.809
and we can talk later, okay?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.844
Schwartzy is allergic
to commitment.

26:51.878 --> 26:54.280
So the fact that we've got
one big commitment today,

26:54.313 --> 26:56.415
and that being Katie,
I don't want to push it.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.417
But I'm serious about it,
and you know me.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.219
- You have a great
sense of humor,

27:00.252 --> 27:01.754
but when it comes to business,
you don't joke around.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.055
- All right,
I'll see you guys later.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.424
- Okay, bye, Lisa.
Give me more beer.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.227
- Let me ask you something.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.863
So are you busy in, like,
three months?

27:10.897 --> 27:14.066
Because if not, maybe you
want to open up a f---ing bar

27:14.100 --> 27:17.336
with Lisa Vanderpump,
called Tom Tom.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.071
- Oh, my God.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.240
I should just stop
overthinking it and say yes.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.308
- Exactly.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.710
- But...ugh, what?

27:23.743 --> 27:25.411
- I'll kick your ass.

27:25.444 --> 27:30.349
*

27:38.224 --> 27:40.259
- If you're gonna tell me
that I pretended to think--

27:40.292 --> 27:42.929
to say my phone died...

27:42.962 --> 27:46.298
then what's the answer
to that question?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.334
- That's mean.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.202
Ariana, I like you,
and you hurt my feelings

27:50.236 --> 27:51.337
when you're mean to me,

27:51.370 --> 27:52.739
so can you just, like,
start liking me?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.473
Maybe you're, like,
closing yourself off.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.809
- Every spare minute
that I have

27:56.843 --> 28:00.747
is spent toward work
or developing friendships.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.315
- Just say you don't want
any new friends.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.751
- I don't have to be friends
with Stassi,

28:04.784 --> 28:07.353
because nobody has
to be friends with Stassi.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.188
- I'm not saying
I don't want any new friends.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.790
- But then what point
are you trying to make?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.825
- I'm saying I'm doing
the best that I can.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.761
- We all are.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.829
- I'm just--I really am
doing the best that I can.

28:16.863 --> 28:19.398
- Okay.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.767
- Trying to fit everything in,

28:20.800 --> 28:24.503
trying to do this f---ing
cocktail book.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.774
I'm really trying to, like,
not be a f---ing

28:27.807 --> 28:31.277
30-something-year-old
bartender in a restaurant

28:31.310 --> 28:32.979
that's just doing nothing.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.346
- But you're not.
- Like, I'm putting

28:34.380 --> 28:35.782
so much effort into things,

28:36.983 --> 28:37.716
and I'm just, like, really
hoping that something happens.

28:38.284 --> 28:38.717
You know what I mean?

28:39.518 --> 28:39.551
- Yeah, but you're
doing all of that.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.353
- Sorry.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.288
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- It's weird.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.290
I don't know why
I'm doing this right now.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.759
- It's okay to be emotional
and, like, feel it,

28:46.793 --> 28:49.862
and don't feel sad
about feeling sad.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.498
I have wanted to crack her
for so long.

28:52.531 --> 28:55.768
Like, dude,
this is so interesting.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.903
What is this?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.404
Nobody is great all the time.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.239
You're not a human being

29:00.272 --> 29:02.374
if you're not feeling sad
at certain times.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.276
- You know, I guess
Stassi's not as bad

29:04.310 --> 29:05.411
as I thought she was.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.413
She's taking the time
to comfort me.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.515
You know,
she's not a total monster.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.250
We're friendly acquaintances.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.552
We love the same people.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.889
So don't say I'm mean.
I'm not mean.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.424
I'll f---ing kill you.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.959
- But, like,
how would you kill me?

29:19.992 --> 29:22.461
- Okay, well, it would be slow.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.431
'Cause if I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna make it hurt.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.299
- Maybe we have
more in common than we think

29:27.333 --> 29:29.468
because I like the thought
of murdering people, too.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.037
- I mean, if we couldn't
go to jail...

29:31.070 --> 29:33.472
- Hashtag, murder for life,

29:33.505 --> 29:34.473
but, like, the number four.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.945
both: 4 L-Y-F-E.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.547
- Are we the same person?

29:41.580 --> 29:44.450
[laughter]
- We've got one more for you.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.018
- We need you all
on the dance floor.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.420
- You know you've got
to get down.

29:48.454 --> 30:02.368
- We hope you've had
a good time.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.436
- What's up?

30:04.470 --> 30:06.038
you know, I surprised him
with the triplets,

30:06.072 --> 30:09.842
but I have another surprise
for him.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.477
Surprise, I brought my trumpet!

30:11.510 --> 30:13.279
*

30:13.312 --> 30:15.481
- * When all you

30:15.514 --> 30:17.850
* And everyone we know

30:17.884 --> 30:20.452
* Could believe do

30:20.486 --> 30:22.421
* And share in what was true

30:22.454 --> 30:23.956
* I said

30:23.990 --> 30:26.926
*

30:26.959 --> 30:28.294
* I said

30:28.327 --> 30:31.063
*

30:31.097 --> 30:32.598
* I said dance hall days

30:32.631 --> 30:36.468
*

30:36.502 --> 30:38.004
* Dance hall days

30:38.037 --> 30:40.006
*

30:40.039 --> 30:43.542
* Dance hall days

30:43.575 --> 30:53.619
*

30:53.652 --> 30:58.824
*

31:02.694 --> 31:04.330
- Thank you, guys.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.498

31:12.671 --> 31:14.974
- Mama [indistinct].
You leaving?

31:15.007 --> 31:16.008
- Yeah, honey.
- I love you.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.110
- Yeah, we did.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.512
- She's gonna go home
and go to bed.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.948
- No!

31:21.981 --> 31:24.016
- Tonight is the night!

31:24.050 --> 31:25.484
- I'm not ovulating.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.022
- Let's not get too mushy,

31:30.056 --> 31:31.590
but I just want to say
I love you guys.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.392
We don't need to hug it out,
'cause we've had enough mush.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.561
- No.
- All right, we'll hug it out.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.462
- Yes.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.999
- I love Jax and Tom
so, so much.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.035
They're like family.
I'd take a bullet for 'em.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.171
Maybe, like, in the leg.

31:45.204 --> 31:48.574
- Six years ago, we were
sitting on your hardwood floor,

31:48.607 --> 31:50.109
and Pinterested wedding stuff.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.410
- And Tom would come home
and be like,

31:52.444 --> 31:53.479
"What are you guys doing?"
We're like, "Don't look."

31:53.512 --> 31:55.447
- There is not one person

31:55.481 --> 31:57.483
that could say
one negative thing about you.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.118
- Oh, no.
- You know what that's like?

31:59.151 --> 32:01.453
You know what that's like?
How 'bout being me?

32:01.487 --> 32:02.989
You know what,
they might not like you

32:03.022 --> 32:04.356
because you're
friends with me.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.491
- Hey, wait.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.394
- What's that like to have
somebody love you that much?

32:09.628 --> 32:12.198
- It's amazing.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.466
It's gonna come for you.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.501
It is.

32:16.535 --> 32:17.636
- Listen, it might take me,
like, a few years,

32:18.737 --> 32:21.107
maybe 10 years, 20, whatever.
Let's not go there.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.541
But I will find it.

32:22.574 --> 32:23.542
Are y'all gonna leave me?

32:24.643 --> 32:26.112
- No, we have plenty of room
for Schmoopy in our lives.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.014
- I don't want y'all
to leave me.

32:28.047 --> 32:28.981
- I hated when you guys fought.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.217
- Well, I mean,
he f---ed my girlfriend.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.985
- It was an accident.
- Twice.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.620
- Maybe three times.
- I didn't f--- her three times.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.556
- I never knew I would actually
really give a f--- about you,

32:37.589 --> 32:39.425
but, like,
if somebody f---s with you,

32:39.458 --> 32:40.292
I'm gonna f--- them up.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.428
- What if a bear
attacked him right now?

32:42.461 --> 32:43.295
- I'd f---
that f---ing bear up.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.031
- I would eye-gouge them
and them rape.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.065
No, I wouldn't rape the bear.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.134
If he consented,
I would rape the bear, yeah.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.169
Wait, if he consents,
it's not rape then.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.437
- Even if he's like, "Ehhh"?

32:52.404 --> 32:53.539
- Eww, that does sound
like a bear being raped.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.674
- Jesus Christ.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.210
- He goes MIA for six days,

doesn't answer any of my calls,
doesn't talk to me--

[upbeat music]

- Hi, Bubba. They're raising
the stakes out here.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.496
- Yeah, look at this ring.
He's wearing a ring and it's--

33:18.830 --> 33:20.366
- I love that ring.
- It's good, right?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.168
- Yeah, it looks good on you.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.203
Now where is
the wedding certificate?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.237
I need to sign it.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.173
- So here.

33:27.206 --> 33:31.110
- I have become extraordinarily
invested in their lives,

33:31.143 --> 33:34.180
and I'm so honored
and really touched

33:34.213 --> 33:35.514
to have been
part of their wedding.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.682
- Well, look at--
this is where it says

33:36.715 --> 33:38.450
Maloney-Schwartz right there.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.618
That's official.
- Oh yes.

33:40.652 --> 33:41.687
- This is a court document.
- Thank you, Lisa.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.289
It's official.
Official, official.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.291
I'm a married man.
That's my wife.

I love you, Bubby.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.595
- All right, off you go,
young things.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.564
- Wait, should I take this or--
- No, give it to Katie.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.401
- I got it.
- Exactly, yeah, yeah.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.204
- I really want people
to look at Tom and I

33:58.237 --> 34:01.607
as the couple who is
very committed to one another.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.143
- Thank God it's over.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.478
- You were amazing, but I knew
you were gonna be amazing.

34:06.512 --> 34:09.581
- And I really hope that
we can be viewed as a couple

34:09.615 --> 34:11.483
who fights for the relationship

34:11.517 --> 34:13.619
and is committed
to the relationship.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.188
Not just to tough it out

34:16.222 --> 34:17.623
or, you know,
just sweep things under.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.725
I want people
to view us as that couple

34:19.758 --> 34:21.360
that f---ing made it.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.130
Don't deal.
You're my husband now.

I am about two minutes away.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.783
It's been a very rough morning,

34:44.816 --> 34:48.287
so I apologize for being late,

34:48.320 --> 34:51.523
and, um, I'll see you
in a second.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.639
Hi.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.807
- Are you okay?

35:08.840 --> 35:10.276
- I've been better.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.811
- Do I know
what this is about?

35:12.844 --> 35:15.514
- Um...
- Come, let's go and sit down.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.287
What is it?
You seem really...

35:21.320 --> 35:23.755
- Yeah, um,
there's a lot of things

35:23.789 --> 35:26.558
that I found out recently

35:26.592 --> 35:27.693
about Shay.

35:27.726 --> 35:31.230
- I've heard rumblings,
Scheana.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.798
- He goes MIA for six days,

35:32.831 --> 35:35.201
doesn't answer any of my calls,
doesn't talk to me, clears out--

35:35.234 --> 35:36.368
- But what's the conversation
you have with him

35:36.402 --> 35:37.836
when he comes back
after six days?

35:37.869 --> 35:39.638
I know the conversation
I would have with Ken

35:39.671 --> 35:41.273
would be a very short one.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.341
- We haven't talked much.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.842
- So he's back in your
apartment after six days--

35:43.875 --> 35:45.244
- No, no, no, no.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.746
He has not stayed with me
once in two weeks.

35:47.779 --> 35:51.283
All summer I've been acting like
everything's okay,

35:51.317 --> 35:52.851
it's all peachy-keen

35:52.884 --> 35:56.388
and f---ing rainbows
and sunshine, and it's not.

35:56.422 --> 35:59.391
I've not only been lying
to all of my friends.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.592
I've been lying to myself.

36:00.626 --> 36:01.727
- Where is he staying?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.295
- He's staying
with his parents.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.763
- This is all bullsh--.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.398
- This has all been
in the last two weeks.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.766
This hasn't been, like,
for eight months--

36:07.799 --> 36:09.701
- Since you got married,
it's been bullsh--.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.237
Hasn't it?
- Yeah.

36:12.438 --> 36:13.305
- Since the day you found out
he was addicted to pills,

36:13.905 --> 36:15.774
it's all been bullsh--.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.509
It was such a huge red flag.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.845
He hadn't been honest with her
about his addiction.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.814
- Like, oh, my knee is hurting,
so I'm gonna take a Vicodin.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.982
- So he's bloody addicted
to it then.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.285
- You're doing this every day
and you're hiding it from me.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.488
I feel like I've been
cheated on.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.490
- I think Scheana in her gut

36:31.523 --> 36:33.759
knew there was a problem,
but she's that girl

36:33.792 --> 36:35.894
that doesn't want to believe
there's a problem.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.464
- And now he's hiding things
from me again.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.399
Like, I know he's
taking sh-- again.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.834
I just found out
two days ago.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.271
He's been taking Adderall
for months.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.772
- Oh, my God.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.375
- One of my friends
pulls me aside

36:49.408 --> 36:52.644
and says Shay was lying
to get pills,

36:52.678 --> 36:54.280
and he said they were
for other people,

36:54.313 --> 36:55.781
and he was just
the middle man.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.283
Friday morning I woke up,

36:58.049 --> 36:59.651
and I just had really
just like a weird feeling.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.853
So I just, like, started,
like, checking emails,

37:01.887 --> 37:03.855
and I have a notice,
overdraft protection.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.791
And I'm like, overdraft?

37:05.824 --> 37:07.693
There's, like, seven grand
in that account.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.397
And I opened my app,
and there was $32.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.665
- So he cleared your account?
- Mm-hmm.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.402
Like, that right there
just broke me.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.370
I love him so much,
and I--

37:18.404 --> 37:20.406
- You still love him?
- I do.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.741
I can't picture my life
without him,

37:22.774 --> 37:26.912
but I can't picture my life
moving forward in this way.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.315
- Have you had
this discussion with him?

37:29.348 --> 37:30.649
- I'm talking to him tonight.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.684
- I'm sorry, but he drops
the ball on everything.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.686
I mean, do you have
a relationship at home?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.488
Do you connect together
physically?

37:36.522 --> 37:38.957
- He's never home.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.393
- Listen, you're young enough
to start again.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.762
- We were talking about
starting a family next year

37:43.795 --> 37:45.697
and saving up for a house.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.334
- Starting a family with someone
who's not even there?

37:48.367 --> 37:49.568
- I know.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.838
- I know how desperately
Scheana wants this to work out,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.873
but if she can't
look him in the eyes

37:54.906 --> 37:57.876
and trust him,
she doesn't have a lot.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.578
- I want him
to lie to me again.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.347
I want him to look me
in the eyes and lie to me

38:01.380 --> 38:03.649
and tell me he's not
taking anything.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.950
- Okay.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.452
- And I'm gonna meet
with a lawyer.

38:06.485 --> 38:09.421
- With a divorce lawyer?
- Yeah.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.456
- Okay.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.458
- 'Cause I'm done.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.628
- You know why I'm
at the studio all the time?

38:16.662 --> 38:17.796
That's where I love to be.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.965
- I just don't get how you guys
just stay up all night

38:19.998 --> 38:22.601
not doing drugs.

38:32.844 --> 38:39.818
*

38:45.957 --> 38:47.926
- Oh, my God, I didn't
even hear you walk in.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.929
So hi.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.565
Did you pierce your ears?

38:53.599 --> 38:56.067
- It was kind of a dare,
but I just kept it.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.371
- Cool.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.839
Do you have
anything you want to say

39:00.872 --> 39:02.608
or do you want me
to just go?

39:02.641 --> 39:04.142
- Well, I'll hear
what you have to say.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.144
- I mean, I want to know
why you didn't come home.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.079
- I had a moment in time
where I was like,

39:08.113 --> 39:10.148
I need to figure
some things out,

39:10.181 --> 39:13.985
without involvement
from everyone else.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.556
I went home, and
I missed you the whole time.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.893
- But to disappear
for six days

39:21.927 --> 39:23.529
and have no communication
with me?

39:23.562 --> 39:25.531
- You never listen,
but guess what,

39:25.564 --> 39:27.833
I got your attention when
I didn't come home, right?

39:27.866 --> 39:31.570
I've been trying for so long.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.539
I just want to be happy,

39:33.572 --> 39:35.441
but I can't be happy
without you.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.642
Like, I know that.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.144
- But this relationship
we're in right now

39:39.177 --> 39:40.546
is not good.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.581
- I married you.
I love you.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.551
I still love you.
I'll always love you.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.587
We're going through
something right now that--

39:48.620 --> 39:50.956
I don't know, just--

39:50.989 --> 39:52.958
It's easy for
a scapegoat for me

39:52.991 --> 39:54.560
because I've been
labeled a druggie.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.495
- So you're not on drugs?

39:56.528 --> 39:58.564
- No.
- No pills, nothing?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.065
- Nothing, no.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.000
- Okay.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.702
- Don't talk to me
like that, though.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.537
People don't talk to me
with respect.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.005
You don't.
Your family doesn't.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.474
Your friends, our friends.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.443
It's always I've been
on a different level.

40:11.477 --> 40:13.579
- I talked to Lisa today
and she just--

40:13.612 --> 40:16.548
- I don't give a sh--
about her.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.483
I have my own mother.

40:18.316 --> 40:21.119
Lisa can go f---ing
talk to her kids.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.455
The way I've been treated,
like how you treat me,

40:23.489 --> 40:24.723
how a lot of people
are treating me--

40:24.756 --> 40:25.724
- By taking care of you.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.125
- How? Financially?

40:27.158 --> 40:28.994
'Cause that's about it.
That's all you do.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.896
- I don't cook for you?
I don't do anything.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.531
- Come on.
- I'm just saying, like--

40:32.564 --> 40:33.665
- Yeah, but guess what,

40:33.699 --> 40:35.133
it hasn't been like that
in a long time.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.203
- Because you don't come home.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.572
- You know why I'm at
the studio all the time?

40:40.606 --> 40:42.007
That's where I love to be.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.543
- I just don't get how you guys
just stay up all night

40:44.576 --> 40:46.712
not doing drugs.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.216
- It's because we're
passionate about what we do

40:51.249 --> 40:52.551
and we love what we do.

40:52.584 --> 40:55.186
When you find that,
you'll get it.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.489
- So all this cash that's
been coming out of the account,

40:57.523 --> 41:00.492
all of that is studio equipment,
music sh--.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.093
You're not buying drugs?

41:02.127 --> 41:04.062
- I swear to God, I'm not.

41:04.095 --> 41:07.733
- Shay is denying
being back on drugs,

41:07.766 --> 41:10.001
and although I feel
I'll never know the truth,

41:10.035 --> 41:12.971
I know for sure that this
is not the man I married.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.541
- I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.042
- Ahhh!
- You may kiss your bride.

41:17.075 --> 41:17.943
[cheering]

41:17.976 --> 41:19.778
- This f---ing marriage
has been tainted

41:19.811 --> 41:21.647
since day one.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.551
This relationship
needs to be done on paper,

41:25.584 --> 41:28.654
legally, emotionally,
physically, in every way.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.556
I'm meeting with a lawyer
on Friday.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.596
I know divorces aren't easy,

41:37.629 --> 41:40.231
and it's not something
I ever wanted.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.169
Everything isn't supposed
to last forever.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.672
- This is, this.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.506
- But you know I'm right.

41:56.247 --> 41:59.551
Your room is obviously
a f---ing disaster per us,

41:59.585 --> 42:01.152
and all your clothes
are just in a pile.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.554
There's a couple suitcases.

42:02.588 --> 42:03.755
I don't know
what you need to get,

42:03.789 --> 42:06.091
but...

42:06.124 --> 42:09.327
- * Let it burn
as it goes down *

42:09.360 --> 42:12.798
* It's a bitter pill to swallow
but you do it now *

42:12.831 --> 42:15.333
* Let it burn as it goes down

42:15.366 --> 42:17.235
- I planned on spending
the rest of my life with him

42:17.268 --> 42:19.571
and growing old with him
and having kids with him.

42:19.605 --> 42:22.140
- * Yeah, yeah

42:22.173 --> 42:25.043
* Yeah

42:25.076 --> 42:26.177
*

42:26.211 --> 42:30.616
* Hey

42:30.649 --> 42:34.653
- All I know is we're done.

42:34.686 --> 42:40.258
- * Let it burn, oh

42:40.291 --> 42:42.594
* Yeah, yeah

42:42.628 --> 42:46.264
* Yeah

42:46.297 --> 42:50.168
* Let it burn, oh
