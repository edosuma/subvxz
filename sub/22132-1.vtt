lost my confidence

12:11.299 --> 12:15.799
the guy should be on the beach and more
bitch

12:15.799 --> 12:23.000
you pulled a family of four got a killer
surf by yourself just because of you

12:23.000 --> 12:24.259

12:24.259 --> 12:27.409
the girls in the hospital

12:27.409 --> 12:30.769
she's alive she's in intensive care she
hasn't regained consciousness

12:31.759 --> 12:36.919
that's because of me couple years ago
would have saved them all

12:36.919 --> 12:42.589
bitch three times in that circle to
taking it out of anyone

12:42.590 --> 12:49.040
wasn't about the entire I've been tired
before I make mistakes rock

12:49.039 --> 12:53.179
I thought the little girl was caught in
a rip current she was in the lava - we

12:53.179 --> 12:56.719
spent most of my time looking in the
wrong place

12:57.679 --> 13:00.139
look at that rock face

13:00.139 --> 13:04.850
look at the way the waves break along in
caves lava tubes riptides

13:04.850 --> 13:09.800
that's why the family was sucked in how
are you - no tell that by just looking

13:09.799 --> 13:10.819
at it

13:10.820 --> 13:13.820
experience this is my turf

13:15.120 --> 13:17.870

what do you want to work my tower no no
I want to talk about something in a

14:44.198 --> 14:44.798
minute

14:44.798 --> 14:50.798
sure ok but government our the incident
with that little girl is really affected

14:50.798 --> 14:53.108
me ignorant skills right

14:53.109 --> 14:56.199
every day ok now as lifeguards

14:56.198 --> 15:00.878
how do we learn we learn from personal
experience we also learned by talking to

15:00.879 --> 15:01.629
each other

15:01.629 --> 15:07.178
rock the idea of the center is a place
for lifeguards come from all over the

15:07.178 --> 15:13.119
world and they share ideas personal
experiences rescue techniques I learned

15:13.119 --> 15:17.980
from each other you know if I talk to
you before that family was swept off the

15:17.980 --> 15:21.310
rocks but i held that rescue different

15:21.309 --> 15:24.399
approaching off the guilt trip and what
difference does it make what the

15:24.399 --> 15:27.879
motivation is here it's about saving
lives okay okay okay don't bite my head

15:27.879 --> 15:33.610
off rock in Australia last year I lost a
hundred swimmers due to drama in Japan

15:33.610 --> 15:34.990
one weekend alone

15:34.990 --> 15:38.950
they lost 80 people that may not have
happened the lifeguards to talk to each

15:38.950 --> 15:39.640
other

15:39.639 --> 15:43.509
all I'm saying is maybe a little what
you know combined with a little of what

15:43.509 --> 15:49.480
I know I could help solve the problem
about going back to LA and setting it up

15:49.480 --> 15:51.550
there but la is not the right spot

15:51.549 --> 15:55.028
conditions are to just train right

15:55.028 --> 16:00.250
every possible situation reef breaks
short breaks Big Sur flat surface cliffs

16:00.250 --> 16:01.210
play

16:01.210 --> 16:11.560
yeah wha northshore team rocked team
should be trained hear me with all kinds

16:11.559 --> 16:13.689
of conditions we can help you with that

16:13.690 --> 16:18.220

of rows and the competitive should bring

16:42.100 --> 16:43.980
an edge to training hate to lose it
anyway

16:43.980 --> 16:47.820
South Africans are pretty innovative

32:23.470 --> 32:24.579
you to do it all

32:24.579 --> 32:29.230
it's this is your show you put the money
together set it all up and basically

32:29.230 --> 32:32.650
this kitchen has shown that got
responsibilities back in LA

32:32.650 --> 32:36.160
I'm sure you can handle it I'll be
around for advice and counsel

32:38.259 --> 32:39.650
all right

32:39.650 --> 32:42.650
I won't let you down I know you

32:44.230 --> 32:47.230
why picture

32:56.410 --> 32:58.179
I'm Shaun Munro

32:58.179 --> 32:59.170
yeah

32:59.170 --> 33:01.289
ten years of LA County

33:01.289 --> 33:05.879
five years here in Hawaii gonna be
setting up a lifeguard training center

33:05.880 --> 33:06.570
here

33:06.569 --> 33:10.619
but before we can invite any other
lifeguards every member of this team

33:10.619 --> 33:13.559
must know these waters

33:13.559 --> 33:16.829
the beaches the surf the ribs

33:16.829 --> 33:20.939
every kind of condition so we will train

33:21.809 --> 33:23.629
you will train

33:23.630 --> 33:27.170
so every member of this team is
proficient with the equipment and the

33:27.170 --> 33:28.730
area

33:28.730 --> 33:31.730
the training will be difficult and
dangerous

33:32.390 --> 33:35.660
now bitch pick me to head up this team

33:35.660 --> 33:38.840
he picked you to be a part of this team
I say that again

33:39.349 --> 33:42.349
he picked you I didn't

33:43.420 --> 33:46.660
so I'm assuming you must all be pretty
good huh

33:46.660 --> 33:53.140
strong swimmers great lifeguards heroes
where you're from right

33:54.650 --> 33:56.320
well I Got News feet

33:56.319 --> 34:01.119
this is the North Shore of Oahu well it
doesn't look like much today the waves

34:01.119 --> 34:06.008
here are the biggest and most dangerous
in the world understand that everything

34:06.009 --> 34:08.260
about the ocean changes completely

34:08.260 --> 34:12.219
by the way it goes over eight feet and
here they don't stop at eight they go

34:12.219 --> 34:13.480
well over 30 feet

34:13.480 --> 34:20.800
I'll say that again 30 feet that scare
you know it should

34:22.800 --> 34:27.600
when you get caught in the drop zone and
you will get caught in the drop zone

34:29.159 --> 34:32.940
it's going to feel like a three-story
building dropping right on your head

34:34.809 --> 34:38.409
I am sure you will have to learn to deal
with not only big surf and adverse

34:38.409 --> 34:42.159
conditions but with death because people
died here

34:42.159 --> 34:49.779
lifeguards die here this will be an
elite team since every team has a weak

34:49.780 --> 34:50.440
link

34:50.440 --> 34:54.940
I'm going to do us all a favor I'm going
to find the weak link

34:54.940 --> 35:01.840
i'm going to send them home now if you
know that you're the weak link you can

35:01.840 --> 35:04.059
do me a favor

35:04.059 --> 35:07.059
quit now

35:14.210 --> 35:17.210
training starts to mom

35:22.969 --> 35:27.500
do you think it's gonna be not may you
go before I will

35:27.500 --> 35:31.670
really I've never been awake link in my
life and it's not going to start here

35:32.210 --> 35:35.599
I don't think it was that serious you
can think about how serious it wasn't a

35:35.599 --> 35:36.619
plane ride high

35:36.619 --> 35:43.340
who's going home me you think it's me
forget that the plant my ass before they

35:43.340 --> 35:46.340
send me home

35:47.050 --> 35:50.050
so it was a little over the top I think
you got their attention

35:50.829 --> 35:54.159
you come along now I got someone I gotta
see

35:54.159 --> 36:00.399
keep up the good work you get you thanks

36:02.570 --> 36:06.470
I don't know if I like this guy what do
you know about it more than you do

36:07.800 --> 36:10.720
you know it just seems like he's trying
to set all of us against one of them

36:10.719 --> 36:12.519
which would never do something

36:12.519 --> 36:16.179
he's a hard-ass but he's right it's
always a weak link

36:16.719 --> 36:19.719
I really find out during training then
later on when it really counts

36:20.619 --> 36:23.619
so what if it's me I have to go home
you're going to stay

36:24.838 --> 36:28.179
you hope it's not me so that you don't
have to make that decision

36:28.179 --> 36:31.750
of course that if I get sent home then
you get to be here alone with comb

36:31.750 --> 36:38.170
Jesse I looked at her that's all I just
looked at I guarantee you this journey

36:38.170 --> 36:40.440
I'm not the one

36:40.440 --> 36:42.220
good

36:42.219 --> 36:45.239
you need

36:45.239 --> 36:48.239
yeah

36:48.969 --> 36:51.969
yeah

36:55.989 --> 36:57.489
yeah

36:57.489 --> 37:01.389
thinking that during all this testing
you gonna dance with us or just watch

37:01.389 --> 37:02.710
from the sidelines

37:02.710 --> 37:04.500
a little about

37:04.500 --> 37:07.590
what if you turned out to be that you
were the weeping

37:07.590 --> 37:10.250
that's an interesting thought but

37:10.250 --> 37:11.929
it's not possible

37:11.929 --> 37:14.250
it would be pretty funny

37:14.250 --> 37:17.639
hysterical but not possible

37:17.639 --> 37:20.639
No

37:39.989 --> 37:41.828
