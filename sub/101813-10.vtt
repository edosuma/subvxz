What?

00:50.963 --> 00:54.358
Nothing. I'm just, you know,
admiring the view.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.230
Well, just enjoy it
while it lasts.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.581
I can only try this hard
for so long.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.192
Relax.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.238
I date you for your brains,
not your body.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.069
Apropos, a crossword?

01:10.940 --> 01:13.377
Oh, you saved
last week's puzzle?

01:13.421 --> 01:14.770
Yeah, of course.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.772
What kind of girlfriend
would I be if I didn't?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.382
We are a team.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.123
Come on, you don't need me.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.211
I'm dead weight.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.560
I mean, you get
all the hard ones.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.693
I'm just good
for a terrible pun.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.654
Oh, my God. You
-did it without me.
-Ow!

01:29.698 --> 01:33.441
Come on. I mean,
it's-it's almost a week old.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.007
I mean, there's a statute
of limitations.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.139
Unbelievable!

01:36.183 --> 01:37.445
Gin fizz for the lady.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.229
Not too sweet.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.579
Uh ...e gentleman
on the phone

01:41.623 --> 01:43.277
thought you'd need a drink
to take his call.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.497
Oh, God.
Take that.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.326
Magnum, this better be
an emergency.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.980
Believe it or not, Higgins,

01:51.023 --> 01:52.808
this qualifies as an emergency.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.592
I'm actually
ten feet up a tree right now.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.767
Let me guess. The lads?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.247
Yeah, you got to call 'em off.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.249
I have a meeting
I got to get to.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.816
What happened
to your dog whistle app?

02:00.859 --> 02:02.426
It... expired.

02:02.470 --> 02:05.125
They wanted $3.99 a month.
I mean, come on. It's crazy.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.126
Yes, well, now, it's cost you

02:06.169 --> 02:07.649
a $19 cocktail.

02:07.692 --> 02:08.954
Actually,
I charged it to your room.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.260
Hey,

02:10.304 --> 02:12.175
I'm gonna put you
on speaker, okay?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.787
Here, guys. Talk to Mama.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.963
Zeus, Apollo,

02:18.007 --> 02:19.791
inside.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.273
That actually worked.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.709
Hey, can I get that

02:24.753 --> 02:26.320
-in a voice memo?
-Oh, enough, Magnum.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.973
All I asked for was
two days of peace and quiet.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.453
You promised
you could handle it.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.803
I can handle it.
-I found you, didn't I?
-How did you

02:31.847 --> 02:33.153
track me down? I didn't tell you

02:33.196 --> 02:34.589
-where we were staying.
-Well, you know,

02:34.632 --> 02:36.460
you're kind of bougie,
you're boyfriend's a doctor.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.896
I figured I'd call
the most expensive hotel

02:37.940 --> 02:40.638
in Oahu. Found you.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.206
Well, Ethan and I thought it
worth the price tag

02:43.250 --> 02:46.296
for some quality alone time.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.168
How's that going, by the way?

02:48.211 --> 02:50.170
First vacation together ...sten.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.824
Can you just please make sure
that the business is operational

02:52.868 --> 02:54.435
by the time I get back?

02:54.478 --> 02:56.828
You know I was a PI for two
years before you even came on.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.656
I'm just saying,
I think I got it.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.831
Well, good.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.877
And I will see you
in two days, Magnum,

03:01.920 --> 03:04.706
not a moment before.

03:05.707 --> 03:08.188
Honestly. I've been
gone for two hours.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.842
In Magnum's defense,

03:10.886 --> 03:13.497
it did sound like
a life-or-death situation.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.890
Give me that.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.676
<i>Magnificent, isn't she?</i>

03:18.720 --> 03:20.330
The grill to end
all grills.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.680
And I've been seasoning her
for the last two days,

03:22.724 --> 03:24.204
so she's raring to go.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.683
I still can't
believe he gets

03:25.727 --> 03:27.207
to borrow that thing
when I couldn't.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.557
Because you have no respect
for the meat.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.212
I mean, you put ketchup
on a ribeye. Come on.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.518
Yes, because it's delicious.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.390
If it makes you feel
any better, I had to beg.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.522
But Rick couldn't say
"no" to Boys Night.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.699
Boys Night?
Where's my invite?

03:41.743 --> 03:42.961
Sorry. It's just
me and Dennis.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.615
I only get him a couple
weekends a month,

03:44.659 --> 03:47.139
and after our plans got
screwed up last weekend,

03:47.183 --> 03:49.403
I want to go all-out
for the do-over.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.882
Well, it sounds like fun,

03:50.926 --> 03:52.797
so if you need a third wheel,
I'm your man.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.538
No, we're good, but
I could use a hand

03:54.582 --> 03:56.105
getting this 200-pound
grill to the car.

03:57.324 --> 04:01.153
I'd love to, Gordie, but
client just got here. Sorry.

04:02.459 --> 04:03.895
-Erin?
-Hi.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.157
Hi. Thomas Magnum.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.898
-Thank you for meeting me.
-Of course.

04:06.942 --> 04:09.074
How can I help you? You
mentioned something on the phone

04:09.118 --> 04:10.902
about receiving
a cryptic message?

04:10.946 --> 04:13.731
Yes, that's right.
I found $2,800

04:13.775 --> 04:15.080
on the windshield
of my car this morning.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.908
No note, no explanation.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.302
But that is my husband
Liam's handwriting.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.912
I'm assuming
he's not in the habit

04:20.956 --> 04:23.132
of leaving you piles of cash?

04:23.175 --> 04:25.482
No, I don't know what to make of
it, but as odd as the money is,

04:25.526 --> 04:28.877
what I find even more confusing
is how it got there.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.575
Liam's supposed to be downrange.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.142
He's active duty?

04:33.185 --> 04:34.578
25th Infantry Division,

04:34.622 --> 04:36.276
currently deployed
to Afghanistan.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.799
As far as I know,

04:37.842 --> 04:40.454
he's 7,500 miles away.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.784
Liam Skyped us from Kabul
just two days ago.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.308
He seemed completely normal.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.135
He said he loved us,
and he missed us,

05:10.179 --> 05:12.224
and he was counting down
the weeks till leave.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.618
Leave plans do change.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.359
It's rare, but it does happen.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361
Did you try contacting the base?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.058
Three voice mails,
all unanswered.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.060
And Liam's not
picking up his cell.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.845
If he's here
on the island,

05:23.888 --> 05:26.108
you know,
why wouldn't he tell me?

05:27.370 --> 05:28.893
And why hasn't he come home?

05:28.937 --> 05:31.026
Well, it's unusual, I agree,

05:31.069 --> 05:32.723
but I wouldn't
worry about it.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.377
If he's here on the island,

05:34.421 --> 05:36.292
-I'll find him.
-Thank you.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.251
<i>Normally, this would be the time</i>

05:39.295 --> 05:40.992
<i>where Higgy's skill set
comes in handy,</i>

05:41.036 --> 05:42.994
<i>but since I'm flying solo today,</i>

05:43.038 --> 05:44.996
<i>I'll have to solve this case
old-school.</i>

05:45.040 --> 05:48.217
<i>You know, pound the pavement,
grease a few palms.</i>

05:48.260 --> 05:50.915
-Look at that. Come on.
Oh. Whoa.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.004
You upped your bribery game.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.919
Yeah, I figured out
that the, uh, tomato pie

05:54.963 --> 05:56.486
travels better
than the key-lime variety.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.835
You live and you learn.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.533
All right, for future reference,

05:59.576 --> 06:01.404
I don't hate a garlic sauce
for the crust.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.014
Okay. Noted.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.364
Uh, how about
that number I sent you?

06:04.407 --> 06:05.408
-Anything?
-Oh, yeah.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.236
Your guy's definitely on Oahu.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.369
Cell pinged a tower
around 4:00 a.m.,

06:09.412 --> 06:12.284
but it's been dark ever since,
so no clue where he is.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.764
Hmm.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.549
But we do know where he was.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.724
Not sure I follow.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.290
Well, there can't be
too many flights

06:18.334 --> 06:19.857
that travel
from Kabul to Honolulu

06:19.901 --> 06:21.337
in less than 48 hours,

06:21.381 --> 06:23.687
So if we can identify what plane
he was on, maybe we can

06:23.731 --> 06:24.949
find somebody who talked to him.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.690
And just how you gonna do that?

06:26.734 --> 06:28.388
Come on, I...
You're not my only friend.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.867
I know guys at the airport.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.216
And I'll tell you what, Tatty,

06:31.260 --> 06:32.783
th-they don't care
about garlic sauce.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.045
Keep an eye
on that number.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.438
If you find anything,
anything changes,

06:35.482 --> 06:36.613
let me know.

06:42.793 --> 06:45.405
-So, no estate to manage.
-Hmm.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.972
-No surgeries to perform.
-Mm...

06:48.016 --> 06:51.149
And I told the front desk
to hold all our calls,

06:51.193 --> 06:53.413
so the day is
wide open.

06:53.456 --> 06:54.892
What shall we do?

06:54.936 --> 06:57.721
We can get massages, grab lunch?

06:57.765 --> 06:58.983
Hmm.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.116
Or we could just stay here.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.598
What exactly
do you have in mind?

07:06.513 --> 07:08.297
Mmm.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.822
Oh, my God.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.433
This coconut cake.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.130
You have to try this.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.742
Wow.

07:18.786 --> 07:19.917
Right?
Mmm.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.400
See? I told you they wouldn't
forget the waffles.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.578
Oh, hi.
You're not room service.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.362
No, I'm Jared.
I'm a guest here.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.364
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need your help.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.670
Yeah, what's wrong?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.759
Well, I was planning to propose

07:35.803 --> 07:39.328
to my girlfriend this weekend,
but, um, I hit a snag.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.678
I lost the ring.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.204
Yeah, that's a
pretty big snag.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.728
I had the ring loose
in my pocket

07:47.771 --> 07:49.643
so she wouldn't spot the box,
and then at some point,

07:49.686 --> 07:51.296
somewhere, it fell out,

07:51.340 --> 07:53.473
and the only reason
I haven't had a heart attack

07:53.516 --> 07:55.518
is because I'm pretty sure
it's in here.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.389
You think your ring
is in our room?

07:57.433 --> 07:59.000
We were checked in here
earlier this morning.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.871
When I told the hotel
what I had planned,

08:00.915 --> 08:02.960
they upgraded us
to a bigger suite,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.006
which I have searched
top to bottom.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.399
So it's got to be in here.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.314
Well, uh, by all means,
come in and look for it.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.360
I'm sure the three of us
can find it together.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.754
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.974
<i>My friend at the airport
came through.</i>

08:17.018 --> 08:19.716
<i>Got the airline to reach out
to Liam's seatmate.</i>

08:19.760 --> 08:21.370
<i>I just hope she can help me.</i>

08:23.372 --> 08:25.374
-Aloha. Mr. Magnum?
-Hi, Mrs. Kama.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.028
Thanks for taking the call.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.247
Of course.
The airline said that you had

08:29.291 --> 08:30.553
some questions about the man

08:30.597 --> 08:32.381
I sat next to
on the flight last night.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.557
Yeah. Staff Sergeant Liam Bates.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
Has something happened?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.692
Well, he's missing,
and we think you may have been

08:38.735 --> 08:40.694
the last person to have
a conversation with him.

08:41.608 --> 08:42.696
How can I help?

08:42.739 --> 08:44.524
Uh, how did he seem
on the flight?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.395
Was he upset at all?

08:47.396 --> 08:49.006
Just the opposite.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.574
If anything,
I was the one struggling.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.886
Not to be rude, but...

08:58.929 --> 09:00.844
looks like you need this
more than I do.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.237
I have an extra one.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.586
Felt like celebrating.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.284
Okay.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.591
Thank you.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.593
That's very kind.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.030
What were you celebrating?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.858
I'm headed home
to surprise my family.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.381
Got early leave.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.600
You're a soldier.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.862
Yes, ma'am.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.082
My husband was Army.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.736
But he never got
an early leave, though.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.215
How did you swing it?

09:24.259 --> 09:26.391
My buddy Kaeo...

09:26.435 --> 09:28.480
bet his time slot
in last week's poker game.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.786
I cleaned up.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.222
-Oh.
-Even got enough
pocket change

09:31.266 --> 09:34.748
to take the wife out
to dinner every night this week.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.318
It's okay.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.103
So, your husband,
where was he stationed?

09:42.146 --> 09:45.236
He kept me talking the
entire flight, God bless him.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.890
Did he say anything about

09:46.934 --> 09:49.066
any plans he may have had
on the island?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.764
None whatsoever.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.722
And he went straight home
after the airport.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.594
What makes you so sure?

09:54.637 --> 09:57.597
Well, at the taxi stand,
I offered to share a cab,

09:57.640 --> 09:59.511
and he said he didn't want
to wait a second longer

09:59.555 --> 10:01.122
than he had to
to see his family.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.428
He got into his own taxi,
drove off.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.648
I don't suppose you got
the name of the cab company.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.432
Sorry. Wish I did.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.651
No, don't worry about it.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.740
Uh, you've been very helpful.

10:10.784 --> 10:11.611
Mahalo.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.786
Of course.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.484
<i>Liam never made it home,</i>

10:15.527 --> 10:18.008
<i>which means something must have happened on that cab ride.</i>

10:18.052 --> 10:19.401
<i>And, unfortunately,</i>

10:19.444 --> 10:20.576
<i>I don't think
it was anything good.</i>

10:38.681 --> 10:40.465
Can't believe this.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.685
What do I do now?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.644
It's okay.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.123
We'll just start over.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.212
Don't bother.
It's not here.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.649
I'm supposed
to take Lanie

10:49.692 --> 10:51.346
on a whale watching
tour in ten minutes.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.177
I... It's okay.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.397
You-you go on, and, uh,
we can keep looking.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.182
We can retrace your steps,

11:01.225 --> 11:03.663
talk to lost and found,
housekeeping.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.142
You know, we know they cleaned
the room earlier.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.317
I can't ask you to do that.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.362
You didn't ask.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.711
We're offering.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.147
Juliet, here,

11:10.191 --> 11:11.366
is the best private investigator

11:11.409 --> 11:14.369
on Oahu.
If anyone can find that ring,

11:14.412 --> 11:16.153
-she can.
-Look, he's exaggerating,

11:16.197 --> 11:18.025
of course, but, um...

11:18.068 --> 11:19.809
no, I'd be happy to help you.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.202
-You're sure?
-Yes.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.986
Go and enjoy your day
with Lanie and, uh,

11:23.030 --> 11:25.206
and we'll come find you
if we have any news.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.425
Thank you.
Both of you.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.821
Consider yourselves
-invited to the wedding.
Ah.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.910
Yay.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.174
I'm so sorry.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.873
Somehow, this is turning into
a working weekend.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.049
Are you kidding me?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.833
I get to see you in action.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.835
Take Your Boyfriend to Work Day.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.010
It's gonna be so much fun.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.142
So much fun.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.537
Come on.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.583
You two looked pretty cozy

11:54.626 --> 11:56.628
on the dance floor
the other night.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.761
You mean to tell me
nothing's going on?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.894
Well, she told me that
she likes me, which is rad.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.853
But, uh, she works here,
and she needs this job,

12:03.897 --> 12:05.550
and, you know,
if things go south,

12:05.594 --> 12:07.901
it could get complicated.

12:07.944 --> 12:11.469
So we decided it's best
not to go there.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.602
You're a good man, Orville.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.647
No, of course.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.781
I totally understand.
Thank you for your time.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.783
That didn't sound good.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.481
Case going okay?

12:23.525 --> 12:25.266
No, not really.
I've been

12:25.309 --> 12:27.442
calling taxicab dispatch lines,

12:27.485 --> 12:29.052
trying to figure out which cab

12:29.096 --> 12:30.314
Liam jumped into
at the airport.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.882
Ah, the old needle in
a haystack routine.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.972
No, there's actually
a method to my madness.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.801
So, there are 12 cab
companies on the island,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.237
ten of which operate
directly at the airport,

12:40.281 --> 12:44.067
and six of which offer discounts
to military personnel.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.590
Mm. Safe bet that
the taxi stand

12:45.634 --> 12:47.288
steered your guy
over to one of those.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.247
Exactly. So what I have to do
is call these six companies,

12:50.291 --> 12:51.945
see if I can identify
an employee that's willing

12:51.988 --> 12:54.643
to scour the books for the fare
that I'm looking for,

12:54.686 --> 12:57.472
and then convince them
to give me the driver's name

12:57.515 --> 13:01.258
and address and information,
and then...

13:01.302 --> 13:02.694
call Higgins.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.827
She can hack this info
for you in half the time.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.264
What fun is there in that?

13:07.308 --> 13:10.615
Spoken like a man whose pride
is doing the talking.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.313
Listen, man,
asking for help

13:12.356 --> 13:14.663
is a sign of strength,
not weakness.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.839
But Higgins is on vacation.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.668
I mean,
hasn't she earned a break?

13:19.711 --> 13:22.105
A-And she's
screening my phone calls.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.548
♪ Hot barbecue today

13:52.092 --> 13:54.181
♪ Hot barbecue...

13:56.444 --> 13:58.489
Smells awesome in here.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.143
What's all this?

14:00.187 --> 14:03.016
Another Bobby Flay marathon
-on the Food Network?
-Please.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.148
I'll have you know I can
cook that man under the table.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.716
Hey, try the wings.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.374
-Mmm!
-Not bad, right?

14:13.417 --> 14:15.550
-I'm impressed.
-Yeah, well,

14:15.593 --> 14:17.334
I heard your mom
went vegan.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.770
Thought you could
use a safe space.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.729
-You figured right.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey,

14:20.772 --> 14:23.732
save some room. I got ribs
prepped, the fight paid for.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.908
Thought we'd make a day
of it. A full five hours

14:25.952 --> 14:27.214
of meat-smoking,
fight-watching,

14:27.257 --> 14:28.911
father-son time.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.391
Oh, no.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.088
I'm sorry, Dad, I can't.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.743
What? Why not?

14:34.786 --> 14:37.050
I got a math test on Monday.
Mike and I are supposed to

14:37.093 --> 14:38.790
study at his place
in, like, half an hour.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.923
Oh.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.533
I'm really sorry.
Uh...

14:42.577 --> 14:45.362
No, no. Don't be.
Hey, school takes priority.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.016
Now we're even
for last weekend, right?

14:47.060 --> 14:49.236
Save me some ribs, though?

14:49.279 --> 14:51.455
You bet.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.592
<i>There was a change of plans.</i>

14:57.635 --> 15:00.421
I was supposed to take him home,
but he got a call.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.292
Hmm.
Any idea what about?

15:02.336 --> 15:03.772
No.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.208
But whatever it was

15:05.252 --> 15:06.731
hit him hard.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.516
Hello?

15:09.691 --> 15:10.953
Hey.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.782
What?

15:15.436 --> 15:17.438
H-How did it happen?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.442
Okay.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.053
Thanks for letting me know.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.979
Sir?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.502
We're here.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.942
We sat there for five minutes.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.421
Then he apologized

15:44.465 --> 15:45.640
and gave me a new address.

15:45.683 --> 15:46.946
But the second address

15:46.989 --> 15:48.512
wasn't in the dispatch log.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.818
Guy was so
devastated.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.776
I couldn't bring myself
to run the meter.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.430
Just took him where
he wanted to go.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.955
Can you tell me
where you dropped him?

16:06.139 --> 16:08.619
Yes?

16:08.663 --> 16:10.186
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.319
I may have come at a bad time.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.016
Did you need something?

16:14.060 --> 16:16.323
I'm actually looking
for Liam Bates.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.889
I thought he may have come here.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.023
He gave us the news about Kaeo.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.678
Left a few hours ago.

16:23.721 --> 16:26.376
I'm sorry, what news was that?

16:29.901 --> 16:32.730
Liam said it was an IED.

16:32.774 --> 16:36.691
Their unit was on patrol
last night when it happened.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.649
There were no survivors.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.391
Well, I'm truly sorry
for your loss.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.829
This country owes both of you
a real debt of gratitude.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.744
We appreciate that.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.182
Kaeo died the way he lived--

16:49.225 --> 16:51.140
fighting for what
he believed in.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.360
Ever since he was little...

16:53.403 --> 16:55.710
he had a real sense of duty,
you know?

16:55.753 --> 16:59.235
Right and wrong.
Just a born leader.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.370
This is him
on his 18th birthday.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.328
He led his youth group's
annual camping trip

17:05.372 --> 17:06.851
to Ho'omaluhia that year.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.593
Then he came home
and enlisted.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.683
He knew the risks,
but he did it anyway.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.555
'Cause it mattered to him.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
He sounds like
an incredible man.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.604
You both must be
very proud of your son.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.128
We are.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.437
We always knew that one day we
might get a knock on the door.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.876
If it had to come,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.878
I'm glad it was Liam.

17:33.922 --> 17:37.186
Were he and your son,
uh, very close?

17:37.230 --> 17:39.884
Best friends since day one
in their unit.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
I-I don't know
where Liam went,

17:42.104 --> 17:44.411
but I know he's hurting, too.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.761
And the way he left...

17:46.804 --> 17:49.764
We're worried about him.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.465
I didn't want to say it, but

17:55.509 --> 17:56.814
I think they're right
to be worried.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.077
Look, I got one more stop,

17:58.120 --> 18:00.209
and then I'm gonna
need some help.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.558
Of course.
We're here for you, buddy.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.560
I can't even imagine
what this guy Liam

18:03.604 --> 18:04.996
must be feeling right now.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.390
I mean, he's
alone, hurting.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.000
He's got to be wracked
with survivor's guilt.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.089
Yeah.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.090
And there's no telling
what someone

18:11.133 --> 18:12.613
in those circumstances
might do.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.147
Thank God he wasn't
on that patrol.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.150
I'm sorry.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.283
Don't be.
It's a natural reaction.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.588
No, I know

18:31.632 --> 18:34.591
that someone else died
in Liam's place.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.289
Someone else's husband

18:36.332 --> 18:38.639
or father or son, but...

18:39.814 --> 18:41.903
I'm just so grateful
it wasn't him.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.040
Uh...

18:49.084 --> 18:50.520
Erin, you should know that

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
Kaeo was the man

18:52.305 --> 18:54.350
that was supposed
to be on leave this week.

18:54.394 --> 18:57.484
So, on top of losing
his entire unit,

18:57.527 --> 19:00.661
Liam now thinks
he killed his best friend?

19:03.490 --> 19:06.145
He shouldn't
have to face this alone.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.627
I'm sorry to have to ask,
but, uh,

19:10.671 --> 19:13.021
does Liam have any history
of depression

19:13.064 --> 19:16.459
or erratic behavior?

19:16.503 --> 19:19.288
We had some problems
after his first tour, but

19:19.332 --> 19:21.464
then he got help.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.293
He's... he's been fine
ever since.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.643
Well, you know,
these things, uh,

19:26.687 --> 19:29.864
they can take time
and space to process.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.475
Is there anywhere that
you think Liam would go

19:32.519 --> 19:34.564
to mourn his friend,

19:34.608 --> 19:36.697
you know,
someplace where they

19:36.740 --> 19:38.351
share a connection?

19:38.394 --> 19:41.528
I mean, honestly,
the list is long. They...

19:41.571 --> 19:42.703
they did everything
together.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.313
Is there any way
you could narrow it down?

19:44.357 --> 19:46.707
I mean, we really...

19:46.750 --> 19:48.578
really have to find Liam.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.407
You don't actually think
he'd hurt himself?

19:53.279 --> 19:56.195
I wish I could say no, but...

19:56.238 --> 19:57.761
honestly, I don't know.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.026
Mommy, what's wrong?

20:02.070 --> 20:04.942
Nothing, baby.
Come here.

20:04.986 --> 20:08.163
Yeah, it's okay.
Here.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.688
Look, I'll text you

20:11.732 --> 20:13.037
a list of everything
I can think of,

20:13.081 --> 20:15.257
just find him.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.824
Please.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.353
It's also less expensive

20:24.397 --> 20:26.137
than if you went and bought,
like, a filet mignon

20:26.181 --> 20:27.878
or a rib eye
or a New York strip.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.619
The key to a skirt steak is...

20:29.663 --> 20:30.707
Sharon, hi.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.492
Boys behaving themselves
over there?

20:34.276 --> 20:35.712
No, they're not here.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.671
Dennis said they were
studying at your house.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.457
No, no.
Don't worry, I'm on it.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.632
If they have their phones,
I'll find 'em.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.068
<i>We having fun yet?</i>

20:44.112 --> 20:46.375
It is weirdly damp in here.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.724
Ethan, you root around in people

20:47.768 --> 20:50.249
for a living.
Surely a Hoover is preferable.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.033
Care to test that theory
yourself?

20:54.688 --> 20:55.906
Ugh.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.908
Yeah, there's no ring
in this one either.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.780
Excuse me, uh, ma'am.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.609
Is there another vacuum bag
that we can check?

21:02.652 --> 21:03.827
"We," huh?

21:03.871 --> 21:05.133
One more in the back.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.613
-I'll get it.
-Thanks.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.967
You know, when I agreed
to be your sidekick for the day,

21:13.010 --> 21:16.144
I assumed you'd be doing
the dirty work.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.668
What makes you
think I'm not?

21:18.712 --> 21:19.930
The master key card.

21:19.974 --> 21:20.975
We've looked
everywhere else,

21:21.018 --> 21:22.846
the ring clearly isn't here.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.935
I say we take a peek
at the honeymoon suite.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.676
What do you say?

21:30.158 --> 21:32.116
For the record,

21:32.160 --> 21:33.422
we're staying
in this room next time.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.598
Let's just get to it, shall we?

21:36.643 --> 21:38.471
Who needs room service?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.864
Minibar has everything
you'd ever want.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.823
Are you going
to actually help me look,

21:42.866 --> 21:44.041
or just gape around?

21:44.085 --> 21:45.304
Gape, for sure.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.436
No, you've been
doing this for two years.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.613
The intrigue of a casual B and E
has yet to wear off for me.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.312
Two years? Try 20.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.617
I went to British
boarding school, remember?

21:54.661 --> 21:55.792
Just trying
to picture you

21:55.836 --> 21:57.794
as a teenage delinquent.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.143
Hardly.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.841
I was just...

22:00.884 --> 22:02.799
you know, an outsider,

22:02.843 --> 22:04.323
All my roommates were posh.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.628
Like, really posh,

22:05.672 --> 22:07.369
and I didn't have
the right pedigree,

22:07.413 --> 22:09.850
so I would break into the
school library at night

22:09.893 --> 22:11.460
just to escape.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.897
We couldn't all be Homecoming
King like you, you know.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.639
First, I was runner-up.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.990
Second, my life wasn't exactly
a walk in the park.

22:20.034 --> 22:23.646
Immigrant parents,
only brown kid in high school.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.519
If I was popular,
it was only because

22:26.562 --> 22:28.825
I was so busy trying
to please everyone else.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.697
You know, I was
a 25-year-old

22:30.740 --> 22:32.525
med school grad
before I realized

22:32.568 --> 22:35.745
I didn't know who I was
or what I wanted.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.878
Had to travel halfway
around the world

22:37.921 --> 22:41.011
with Doctors Without Borders
just to figure it out.

22:41.055 --> 22:45.320
Well, I suppose we all rebel
in our own way, eventually.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.241
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
This way.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.862
That must be Lanie.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.387
Mom, it's me.
Please call me back, okay?

23:08.430 --> 23:09.779
It's important.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.694
I mean, I'm okay,

23:11.738 --> 23:13.870
but I just... I need to talk.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.176
Please call me back.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.447
That was close.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.884
Let's get out of here.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.234
The ring must be
-someplace else.
-Yeah.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.106
And I think
I know where.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.415
I'm at Makaha.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.417
No sign of Liam.

23:38.460 --> 23:41.071
Yeah, he's not
at Taiko's, either.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.899
Man, we hit every spot
on the list.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.161
Where is this guy?

23:44.205 --> 23:45.772
I don't know.
You know, after he went

23:45.815 --> 23:47.730
to see Kaeo's parents' house,

23:47.774 --> 23:49.123
I think he went back home

23:49.166 --> 23:50.429
to drop off
the money for his wife.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.734
That's not an accident.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.084
That's...
that's estate planning,

23:54.128 --> 23:56.260
which means
we could be running out of time.

23:56.304 --> 23:59.133
You know, we got
to get inside Liam's head.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.830
You guys remember
how it is coming back home,

24:00.874 --> 24:03.485
and it can be jarring,
you know, even...

24:03.529 --> 24:06.183
even without the kind
of news that Liam got.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.838
There's a difference
between coming home and,

24:08.882 --> 24:11.624
well... coming home.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.191
-I hear that, man.
-Yeah.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.585
You know, whenever
I finished a tour,

24:16.629 --> 24:19.936
my first stop would be this old
movie theater in Chicago.

24:19.980 --> 24:24.114
I'd buy a matinee ticket
and just sit there in the dark,

24:24.158 --> 24:26.943
watching people
watching the movie.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.946
I just had to remember
it was okay to...

24:29.990 --> 24:32.645
relax, you know, forget myself.

24:32.688 --> 24:36.126
It was the Museum
of Art at Duke for me.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.694
Man, I would wander
around for hours,

24:38.738 --> 24:42.481
just feeling everything
I hadn't felt all year.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.832
Yeah. Except we can't check
every movie theater

24:45.875 --> 24:47.660
and museum on Oahu,
so what's our next move?

24:47.703 --> 24:49.836
Hold on for a second.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.668
Next move is to buy my boy Tatty
a gallon of garlic sauce.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.191
Looks like he came through.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.019
Liam just turned
his cell phone on

24:59.062 --> 25:00.673
at an address in Pearl City.

You got a surveillance device

25:45.369 --> 25:46.545
Well, I didn't realize
I was living in a police state.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.024
Excuse me?

25:48.068 --> 25:49.286
You violated my privacy!

25:49.330 --> 25:50.853
Hey, after you
lied to my face,

25:50.897 --> 25:52.899
which pretty much throws any
right to privacy out the window.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.683
Unbelievable!
Do you have any idea

25:54.727 --> 25:56.424
the hell I'm gonna get

25:56.467 --> 25:58.078
-Spare me.
-Right.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.862
I've been taking crap for you
all year. Why care now?

25:59.906 --> 26:01.908
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

26:01.951 --> 26:04.606
You're a cop, Dad.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.216
Do you have any idea
what that's like for me?

26:06.260 --> 26:08.915
Me and my friends--
we're not kids anymore.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.917
We watch the news,
we see the videos.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.223
Some days, it's all
anyone ever talks about.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.748
And as far as everybody else is
concerned, you're one of them.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.098
The bad guys.

26:19.099 --> 26:22.102
And you just
proved them right.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.930
Just go. I'll get home on my own.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.424
You sure you got
the right location?

26:40.468 --> 26:42.905
Yeah. I mean, Liam's phone
last pinged near this address.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.299
Tatty said it was only on
for 90 seconds, though.

26:45.342 --> 26:48.432
Well, I'm guessing he wasn't
here for a mani-pedi.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.260
There. The pawn shop.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.914
What about it?

26:51.958 --> 26:53.524
Well, if he traded his cell
phone in, he would have had

26:53.568 --> 26:55.091
to turn it on
and make sure it works, right?

26:55.135 --> 26:57.050
Only one way to find out.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.015
Help you, guys?

27:06.059 --> 27:07.277
Yeah.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.758
We were wondering
if you had seen this guy.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.543
He, uh, came in here
about 30 minutes ago.

27:12.587 --> 27:15.329
Sorry. I don't recognize him.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.464
Really? Because

27:20.508 --> 27:21.814
unless you were in the Army,

27:21.857 --> 27:23.467
I'd say that's his phone
right there.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.555
Guess I just don't recall.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.079
Look,
this guy might be

27:26.122 --> 27:28.124
in some kind of trouble,
all right? We need to find him.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.691
I don't know what to tell you.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.780
Look, we can pay
for information.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.129
I told you, I don't have any.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.741
Memory's not
what it used to be.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.613
All right, I guess

27:38.657 --> 27:40.659
we're gonna have
to check the security footage.

27:40.702 --> 27:41.790
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

27:41.834 --> 27:42.835
Hey, hey, hey, hang on.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.227
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.794
I'm calling the cops.

27:45.838 --> 27:46.969
You know what? You do
that. We'll do the same to you.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.971
A man's life is
on the line here.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.191
Guys.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.673
I got something.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.111
He sold
Liam a gun.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.421
Okay, listen to me
very carefully.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.033
Before that man who you
sold a weapon to left,

28:07.076 --> 28:09.426
did he give you any indication
where he was going?

28:09.470 --> 28:10.732
Why the hell would I tell you?

28:10.776 --> 28:13.039
'Cause I didn't see
you ask for a permit.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.823
That sale was
off the books.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.912
That man is a vet

28:16.956 --> 28:18.522
with a wife
and kid at home.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.699
All right? And he's having
a really tough time right now,

28:20.742 --> 28:22.701
so if we find him,
this stays between us.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.704
If we don't, we are
the least of your worries.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.359
Said he was headed next door
to buy a six-pack of Coops.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.667
Last I saw, he was waiting on
a corner for the eastbound bus.

28:34.451 --> 28:37.367
The eastbound bus goes
to Ho'omaluhia Park, right?

28:37.411 --> 28:39.456
That was Kaeo's
favorite place to camp.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.242
Secluded, hard to find.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.418
It's a good place to be alone.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.029
Yeah. Let's go.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.206
There she is,
two o'clock.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.425
Or is it eight o'clock?

28:51.468 --> 28:53.775
Is it... is it
your POV or mine?

28:53.819 --> 28:56.778
You really think
she took the ring?

28:56.822 --> 28:59.085
I think it's possible
that she found it, panicked,

28:59.128 --> 29:01.914
and then tried to buy herself
some time by hiding it.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.394
Why else would she make
a frantic call to her mother

29:04.438 --> 29:05.744
in the middle
of a romantic break?

29:05.787 --> 29:09.573
We're gonna have
to get her alone to find out.

29:09.617 --> 29:10.879
Excuse me?

29:10.923 --> 29:15.405
Hi. What are the chances
that I could get you

29:15.449 --> 29:18.931
to tell that man over there that
he's needed at the front desk?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.456
Coming right up.

29:24.501 --> 29:27.113
How do you feel
about role play?

29:42.693 --> 29:44.826
Excuse me?
Are these taken?

29:44.870 --> 29:47.046
No, go right ahead.

29:50.310 --> 29:53.617
Oh, I see you did the
whale-watching tour!

29:53.661 --> 29:55.358
Oh, we loved it.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.665
It's, uh...

29:57.708 --> 30:00.146
It's actually where
Ethan here proposed.

30:01.974 --> 30:06.108
Yeah. Yeah, the 60 seconds I was
on one knee was the only time

30:06.152 --> 30:08.502
anyone saw a whale, so, we,
uh... we missed the whole thing.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.505
Makes for a good story, though.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.463
It certainly does.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.509
Uh, we actually have loads
of them from here.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.032
We come back every year

30:17.076 --> 30:21.515
to remember where it all started
and, uh, how far we've come.

30:21.558 --> 30:24.735
Yeah. Still just as in love
as we were on the first trip.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.956
That's sweet. And rare.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.566
You two are lucky.

30:29.610 --> 30:30.959
Are you married?

30:31.003 --> 30:34.571
Mm-mm, not yet.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.226
My boyfriend and I are
thinking about it, though.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.403
Can I ask you guys
a strange question?

30:41.535 --> 30:44.233
How did you know
it would work out?

30:45.234 --> 30:47.671
We didn't.

30:47.715 --> 30:50.979
I mean, obviously I knew
Jules was amazing.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.199
Beautiful,
intelligent.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.592
She's always bending over
backwards to help others.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.030
I couldn't know what
the future would hold.

30:58.073 --> 31:01.772
All I knew was that,
in years to come,

31:01.816 --> 31:04.993
I'd still be excited
waking up next to her

31:05.037 --> 31:07.909
and figuring it out.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.780
And that's all you
can know, really.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.872
It's a leap
of faith.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.353
Would you guys excuse me?

31:17.397 --> 31:20.182
I don't mean to be rude,
but I have something

31:20.226 --> 31:22.228
I need to go do.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.014
Oh.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.886
You think she's
gonna tell him?

31:27.929 --> 31:29.539
I think so, yeah.

31:29.583 --> 31:33.021
Wow. That was
very good, by the way.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.197
Ah, I do what I can.

31:56.523 --> 31:57.567
This is it.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.613
The campsite
Kaeo's mom showed me.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.093
Well, Liam isn't here.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.313
No, but he was.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.232
Well, if he sat here
thinking long enough,

32:10.276 --> 32:12.060
maybe he didn't
go through with it.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.975
Yeah, either that,
or we're too late.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.499
We got to keep searching before
we lose any more daylight.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.733
Hey, guys.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.493
We call this in,
HPD's still 20 minutes out.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.016
I don't think we got that long.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.454
I got to get down there.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.108
Too many of us will spook him.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.980
All right, be careful, TM.

33:12.381 --> 33:14.122
Easy, Liam.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.906
I just want to talk.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.734
Who the hell are you?

33:17.778 --> 33:19.475
How do you know my name?

33:19.519 --> 33:21.216
My name is Thomas Magnum.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.305
I'm a private investigator.

33:23.349 --> 33:26.221
-Don't come any closer.
-Your wife, Erin,
hired me to find you.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.616
Her and Bella are worried
about you. They just...

33:31.226 --> 33:32.749
...want you to come home.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.187
I can't.

33:35.230 --> 33:38.712
I-I heard what happened
with your unit.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.410
I heard about Kaeo.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.066
-I know the pain you're in.
-What the hell
could you possibly know

33:45.110 --> 33:46.676
about my pain? Huh?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.026
Liam ...told you

33:48.069 --> 33:49.070
to stay back, man!

33:49.114 --> 33:50.767
Come closer, and I'll do it.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.073
I swear to God.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.379
<i>This thing's going south.</i>

33:53.422 --> 33:54.597
We got to do something.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.208
Just give him a minute.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.514
If anyone can get through
to Liam, it's Thomas.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.908
Just hear me out.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.692
I served in the military.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.738
I did six tours.

34:04.781 --> 34:07.088
Okay, so that pain
you're feeling?

34:07.132 --> 34:09.090
That grief?

34:09.134 --> 34:11.049
I know what that is.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.704
I know what it's like
to lose friends,

34:14.748 --> 34:16.402
brothers.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.708
Those guys in your unit?

34:18.752 --> 34:20.797
Kaeo?

34:20.841 --> 34:22.538
They wouldn't want this for you.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.540
How do you know
what they want, huh?

34:24.584 --> 34:26.760
It's not like
you could ask them.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.110
I don't need to.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.417
I've been
one of the unlucky ones.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.593
What are you talking about?

34:34.594 --> 34:37.640
Month into my last tour,
a-a mission went sideways.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.251
Taliban knew we were coming.

34:39.294 --> 34:41.079
The op was DOA.

34:41.122 --> 34:44.560
I ended up
spending 18 months

34:44.604 --> 34:47.824
in a POW camp in the Korengal.

34:47.868 --> 34:51.132
And it's safe to say
I had my share of bad days.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.614
You know what helped me
get through it?

34:55.528 --> 34:57.617
Aarash.

34:58.618 --> 35:01.577
He was my interpreter
in Kabul.

35:01.621 --> 35:04.754
He risked everything for us.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.235
And, you know,
we'd do the same for him.

35:07.279 --> 35:10.978
Morning of the mission,
he wasn't feeling well.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.588
Medical didn't clear him
to leave,

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
and he had to stay back.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.852
But you know what?

35:18.464 --> 35:20.814
Just got lucky.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.644
Some of the darkest days
over there in that POW camp,

35:24.687 --> 35:27.299
when I thought
I wouldn't make it,

35:27.342 --> 35:29.344
what gave me hope...

35:30.345 --> 35:32.347
...was knowing
that Aarash was spared.

35:41.661 --> 35:45.012
I don't know how
to come home without them.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.145
I know.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.844
If you want to honor
their sacrifice...

35:50.887 --> 35:54.369
These guys are your brothers.
You got to find a way.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.024
It's not gonna be easy.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.722
No one just gets over
something like this.

36:01.071 --> 36:04.684
You can find a way
to move forward.

36:04.727 --> 36:08.253
You can find a way to live
your life for your family.

36:12.518 --> 36:14.737
We're gonna give you
what you need

36:14.781 --> 36:17.175
to help you get through this.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.613
Okay?

36:23.355 --> 36:25.226

Look, Dad,
I shouldn't have said...

37:36.428 --> 37:38.081
It's okay. This
is something

37:38.125 --> 37:39.431
we ought to be able

I get why people are mad.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.046
The system is broken.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.005
Even I can see that.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.180
Yeah.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.616
It's failed a lot of people,

38:34.660 --> 38:36.705

38:38.228 --> 38:40.492

38:40.535 --> 38:43.364
Look, I believe

38:43.408 --> 38:45.845
activism is a form
of patriotism.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.238
But I think change, <i>real</i> change,

38:48.282 --> 38:51.372
needs to come from the inside.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.854
So I'm still proud to be a cop.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.204
And I will continue
to show up every day

38:57.247 --> 38:59.032
and do my part
to be better at my job

38:59.075 --> 39:00.642

Turns out,

40:34.344 --> 40:37.652

everything with you.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.349
