00:02.289 --> 00:05.247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

00:06.769 --> 00:09.647
"This guy's the best."
They can't all be the best.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.606
There can't be this many bests.

00:11.849 --> 00:14.682
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.760
Where are these doctors?

00:17.049 --> 00:19.085
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

00:19.249 --> 00:21.717
"You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

00:22.049 --> 00:24.768
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

00:24.929 --> 00:28.205
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

00:28.449 --> 00:31.202
He's just a... He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher."

00:32.089 --> 00:36.162
Then there's always that, " Make sure
you tell him that you know me."

00:36.329 --> 00:38.320
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

00:38.489 --> 00:40.844
What is he...?
"Oh, you know Bob.

00:41.009 --> 00:44.206
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

00:45.009 --> 00:47.239
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs."

00:52.329 --> 00:57.642
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

00:58.369 --> 01:01.202
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

01:03.769 --> 01:04.962
Excuse me?

01:05.129 --> 01:06.608
You know, if you were blind...

01:06.769 --> 01:09.363
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

01:10.369 --> 01:11.688
I don't know.

01:12.329 --> 01:15.765
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

01:19.849 --> 01:22.158
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

01:22.329 --> 01:25.799
I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

01:26.929 --> 01:30.763
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

01:30.929 --> 01:34.444
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

01:34.609 --> 01:36.122
No.

01:36.289 --> 01:39.008
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

01:39.169 --> 01:42.081
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

01:43.649 --> 01:46.482
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.004
And these people
are all over the place.

01:49.329 --> 01:52.366
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

01:54.609 --> 01:56.679
Have you seen any good movies?

01:56.849 --> 01:58.601
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

01:58.769 --> 02:01.078
We have a woman. Why?

02:01.649 --> 02:04.004
- No, I'm just saying.
- She had references.

02:04.169 --> 02:06.763
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.

02:06.929 --> 02:08.965
I'm talking about the ones
that forge them.

02:13.769 --> 02:15.725
You know,
I think this is really helping.

02:15.889 --> 02:17.527
I don't live near here, you know.

02:21.969 --> 02:25.041
So she's giving me the massage
and I'm just making conversation.

02:25.209 --> 02:28.724
- I don't like to talk during a massage.
- Neither do I, but I do it for them.

02:28.889 --> 02:30.959
- I figure they're bored.
- Yeah, I do that too.

02:31.129 --> 02:35.008
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

02:35.169 --> 02:36.887
It stops me from enjoying it.

02:37.049 --> 02:38.528
There's nothing to eat in here.

02:39.089 --> 02:41.478
- I forgot to tell you.
- I'm in the middle of a story.

02:41.649 --> 02:44.004
- Okay, go ahead.
- Why don't you ever go shopping?

02:44.169 --> 02:46.285
It's not like it's a really funny story.

02:46.449 --> 02:49.964
- What happened?
- So she mentioned that she had a son.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.687
And then for some reason...

02:51.849 --> 02:55.524
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.964
- Oh, wasn't that terrible?
- Yes, it was.

02:58.129 --> 02:59.323
Not even an apple.

02:59.489 --> 03:01.480
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.004
- I know it was stupid.
- Really stupid.

03:04.169 --> 03:05.648
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

03:05.809 --> 03:07.879
- What about this Chinese food?
- Take it.

03:08.049 --> 03:11.246
- I can't believe you said that.
- Hey, would you stop it already.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.082
So, what did she say?

03:13.249 --> 03:15.160
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

03:15.689 --> 03:18.681
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

03:18.849 --> 03:21.568
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

03:21.729 --> 03:23.765
- I have a good masseuse.
- No, she's really good.

03:23.929 --> 03:26.238
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

03:26.409 --> 03:28.764
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

03:28.929 --> 03:30.282
It's a real medical procedure.

03:30.449 --> 03:33.919
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

03:36.289 --> 03:38.166
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

03:38.329 --> 03:39.557
Yeah.

03:39.729 --> 03:43.199
- You don't pay for the massage?
- Not if you have a doctor's note.

03:43.369 --> 03:45.007
So where do you get this note?

03:45.169 --> 03:47.399
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

03:47.569 --> 03:49.958
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.642
Right. Your friend Roy.

03:51.809 --> 03:53.640
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

03:53.809 --> 03:57.245
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.479
And you don't have to pay?

04:01.249 --> 04:03.080
We have 3:00 appointments.

04:03.249 --> 04:05.319
- George and Elaine, right?
- Right.

04:05.489 --> 04:07.719
Could you fill these out, please?

04:07.889 --> 04:10.608
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

04:10.769 --> 04:13.727
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.360
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

04:20.569 --> 04:21.797
Yes.

04:24.369 --> 04:27.645
But Raymond is a man.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.282
That's right.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.082
I can't get a massage from a man.

04:41.089 --> 04:42.568
- Why not?
- What, are you crazy?

04:42.729 --> 04:45.004
I can't have a man touching me.

04:45.289 --> 04:46.768
Switch with me.

04:46.929 --> 04:48.362
I don't want the man either.

04:49.809 --> 04:52.642
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

04:52.809 --> 04:56.119
- He'd just be touching your back.
- He'd just be touching your back too.

04:56.289 --> 04:59.042
- No, it could get sexual.
- I know.

04:59.209 --> 05:02.440
That's the point. If it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

05:02.609 --> 05:05.328
- I wouldn't be comfortable.
- I would?

05:05.489 --> 05:08.526
- What if something happens?
- Oh, what could happen?

05:10.289 --> 05:12.200
What if it felt good?

05:14.609 --> 05:17.646
- It's supposed to feel good.
- I don't want it to feel good.

05:18.129 --> 05:21.519
- Then why get the massage?
- Exactly.

05:26.569 --> 05:27.888
George.

05:31.849 --> 05:34.283
- Yes.
- I'm Raymond.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.482
Hello.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.767
Are you ready?

05:42.000 --> 05:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.889 --> 05:53.926
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

05:54.089 --> 05:55.238
Really?

05:55.409 --> 05:57.559
Used to be a flight attendant.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.207
Oh, boy.

06:02.369 --> 06:06.203
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.

06:19.729 --> 06:22.721
- So, what do you do?
- What?

06:23.169 --> 06:25.000
I said, what do you do?

06:25.209 --> 06:26.722
I don't know.

06:27.409 --> 06:29.798
- You don't know what you do?
- No.

06:29.969 --> 06:31.721
Oh, come on.

06:32.529 --> 06:35.839
- You're very tense.
- Coffee. Too much coffee.

06:36.049 --> 06:38.609
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.

06:38.769 --> 06:41.158
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

06:42.089 --> 06:46.162
- But you wrote that it was tender.
- I wrote. I wrote.

06:47.009 --> 06:48.362
I'll check it out.

06:49.129 --> 06:51.404
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Take them off.

07:21.409 --> 07:22.888
How did you hurt this?

07:23.049 --> 07:24.528
I don't know.

07:25.049 --> 07:26.926
- You don't know?
- No.

07:27.089 --> 07:28.761
- But you just told me.
- Korea.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.559
- You hurt it in Korea?
- What?

07:31.729 --> 07:34.118
- The hamstring.
- Korea.

07:34.769 --> 07:36.168
How?

07:36.329 --> 07:37.887
Hamstring.

07:38.049 --> 07:40.279
How did you hurt the hamstring?

07:40.449 --> 07:42.087
Hotel.

07:48.849 --> 07:50.885
How'd it go?

07:52.609 --> 07:54.167
George?

07:55.729 --> 07:59.165
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

07:59.329 --> 08:01.001
What about Thursday?

08:01.169 --> 08:02.761
And Friday?

08:03.449 --> 08:06.759
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

08:11.009 --> 08:12.761
What's with you?

08:14.209 --> 08:15.847
A...

08:16.489 --> 08:18.081
Yes. A...

08:18.369 --> 08:21.361
A man gave me...

08:22.689 --> 08:24.122
Yes. A man gave you...

08:24.289 --> 08:27.247
A man gave me...

08:28.889 --> 08:30.481
...a massage.

08:30.649 --> 08:33.163
- So?
- So he...

08:33.328 --> 08:36.082
...had his hands and...

08:36.369 --> 08:38.724
He was...

08:39.688 --> 08:43.398
- He was what?
- He... He was...

08:43.889 --> 08:45.766
...touching and rubbing.

08:46.849 --> 08:48.202
That's a massage.

08:48.849 --> 08:51.079
- Then I took my pants off.
- You took your pants off?

08:52.209 --> 08:54.040
For my hamstring.

08:54.849 --> 08:56.521
He got about...

08:56.689 --> 08:58.725
...two inches from...

09:00.289 --> 09:01.961
...there.
- Really?

09:03.289 --> 09:05.120
I think it moved.

09:07.169 --> 09:09.000
- It moved?
- It may have moved. I don't know.

09:10.169 --> 09:12.763
- I'm sure it didn't move.
- It moved!

09:12.929 --> 09:15.762
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

09:15.929 --> 09:18.682
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

09:18.849 --> 09:21.044
...shift to the other side.
- No, no.

09:21.209 --> 09:24.679
It wasn't a shift. I've shifted.
This was a move.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.358
- Okay. So what if it moved?
- That's the sign, the test.

09:29.529 --> 09:32.043
If a... If a man makes it move.

09:32.209 --> 09:34.769
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

09:34.929 --> 09:38.365
If it moves as a result of contact.

09:39.009 --> 09:42.240
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

09:42.409 --> 09:44.684
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

09:47.809 --> 09:49.481
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:49.649 --> 09:51.685
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

09:52.689 --> 09:56.079
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

09:56.249 --> 09:57.602
Joe DiMaggio?

09:57.769 --> 09:59.327
- In Dinky Doughnuts?
- Yes.

09:59.489 --> 10:01.639
- Joe DiMaggio.
- No. I'm sorry.

10:01.809 --> 10:05.404
If Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

10:05.569 --> 10:07.560
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

10:07.729 --> 10:09.765
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

10:09.929 --> 10:11.885
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

10:12.049 --> 10:13.607
...because our knees might touch.

10:13.769 --> 10:16.203
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

10:16.369 --> 10:19.281
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

10:19.449 --> 10:21.838
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

10:22.009 --> 10:25.524
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

10:26.449 --> 10:29.646
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

10:31.129 --> 10:32.881
Look, I'm telling...

10:34.609 --> 10:36.998
I'm telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.966
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

10:42.129 --> 10:43.403
What about this doctor's note?

10:43.569 --> 10:45.639
- Let's go see Roy.
- I never said I'd do that.

10:45.809 --> 10:47.879
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

10:48.049 --> 10:50.040
I'm not working. I can't afford that.

10:50.209 --> 10:51.722
I don't know how I feel about it.

10:51.889 --> 10:54.278
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

10:55.409 --> 10:57.001
All right, all right.

10:57.169 --> 10:59.160
A stall man, huh?

11:01.929 --> 11:04.921
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.761
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

11:06.929 --> 11:09.568
- He didn't say he can't.
- lf you feel funny about it at all.

11:09.729 --> 11:11.242
- He doesn't feel funny.
- lf he does.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.842
- Do you feel funny?
- Forget it.

11:13.009 --> 11:16.445
- He didn't say anything.
- He feels funny.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.562
- You don't have to do this.
- He knows that!

11:19.729 --> 11:21.845
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

11:22.009 --> 11:24.000
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

11:24.169 --> 11:26.239
Don't be ridiculous.

11:28.529 --> 11:31.168
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.081
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

11:33.249 --> 11:34.762
How would I know?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.442
Do you like him?

11:37.809 --> 11:39.242
What do you mean, like him?

11:39.529 --> 11:41.838
- Do you like him?
- Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

11:42.009 --> 11:44.364
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

11:44.849 --> 11:47.204
- How come you don't like him?
- Why should I?

11:47.369 --> 11:49.485
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing. Why?

11:49.649 --> 11:51.958
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

11:52.409 --> 11:54.604
- So you want the notes?
- You don't have to, really.

11:54.769 --> 11:56.361
No, no. It's okay.

11:56.529 --> 11:59.680
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

12:00.969 --> 12:02.118
George?

12:05.089 --> 12:06.602
George.

12:09.009 --> 12:10.522
What about the week after?

12:13.369 --> 12:15.724
No appointments at all?

12:16.849 --> 12:18.407
What?

12:19.569 --> 12:21.048
Well, can l...?

12:21.209 --> 12:24.918
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

12:25.889 --> 12:27.447
Forget it.

12:27.609 --> 12:31.443
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

12:31.609 --> 12:34.601
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I'm cut off.

12:34.769 --> 12:37.158
This woman is insane.

12:37.769 --> 12:39.600
What's with you?

12:40.169 --> 12:41.602
What?

12:41.889 --> 12:44.847
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

12:45.169 --> 12:47.205
Hey, you scrunched me.

12:47.369 --> 12:49.803
I sat down here first.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.202
Hey.

12:54.369 --> 12:57.167
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

13:01.809 --> 13:03.561
- Yeah.
- Joe DiMaggio?

13:03.729 --> 13:06.721
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

13:06.889 --> 13:08.288
...and I really watched him.

13:08.449 --> 13:10.599
I studied his every move.

13:10.769 --> 13:13.966
For example, he dunks.

13:15.009 --> 13:17.364
- Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
- That's right.

13:17.529 --> 13:20.805
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

13:20.969 --> 13:22.766
Oh, he's a dunker.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.522
- Why couldn't he be a dunker?
- Nothing diverts his attention.

13:26.689 --> 13:29.442
Like, I'm sitting in there,
you know...

13:29.609 --> 13:34.125
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

13:34.289 --> 13:35.881
Like I'm sitting there, and l...

13:39.369 --> 13:43.408
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

13:48.289 --> 13:52.248
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

13:52.409 --> 13:55.287
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

13:55.449 --> 13:57.838
See, that's how he played baseball.

13:58.009 --> 14:00.364
He dunks like he hits.

14:00.529 --> 14:02.121
- So then what?
- Well...

14:02.289 --> 14:05.042
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

14:05.209 --> 14:07.006
...or they're gonna throw me out.

14:07.169 --> 14:09.808
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

14:14.569 --> 14:16.207
What happened to you?

14:19.089 --> 14:20.966
These kids called me a Mary.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.723
A what?

14:23.889 --> 14:26.244
I was jumping over a puddle.

14:26.409 --> 14:29.606
For some reason, I went like this:

14:31.009 --> 14:32.727
And they called me a Mary.

14:32.889 --> 14:35.881
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

14:36.049 --> 14:39.405
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

14:40.049 --> 14:42.643
Hey, George. What is this?

14:42.809 --> 14:44.037
What is that?

14:44.209 --> 14:46.325
No, really. What is that?

14:51.009 --> 14:52.442
Hello.

14:52.609 --> 14:54.440
Oh, hi, Roy.

14:54.609 --> 14:55.883
What?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.483
Oh, my God.

14:58.249 --> 15:00.205
How did this happen?

15:00.529 --> 15:02.406
What can I do?

15:03.569 --> 15:06.003
I am so sorry.

15:06.289 --> 15:07.563
Okay.

15:07.729 --> 15:08.957
Bye.

15:09.129 --> 15:12.439
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

15:26.609 --> 15:28.201
- I told you.
- Told me what?

15:28.369 --> 15:30.883
- I told you we shouldn't do it.
- I didn't say anything.

15:31.049 --> 15:34.598
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

15:34.769 --> 15:38.648
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

15:38.809 --> 15:41.004
- Three notes?
- Yeah. You, me and George.

15:41.169 --> 15:42.568
- You got me a note?
- Yeah.

15:42.729 --> 15:44.287
- But I got my own note.
- You what?

15:44.449 --> 15:47.759
- I got a note from my gynecologist.
- Why'd you do that?

15:47.929 --> 15:50.762
- I didn't know you'd get me a note.
- Of course I'd get you a note.

15:50.929 --> 15:52.885
- You didn't say anything.
- Neither did you.

15:53.049 --> 15:55.961
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.438
How could you do that
to your friend?

15:59.689 --> 16:04.683
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

16:04.849 --> 16:08.046
Oh, yeah.

16:12.609 --> 16:14.440
- Hi, Pam.
- Hello.

16:14.609 --> 16:16.167
Hello.

16:16.729 --> 16:19.402
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if...

16:19.569 --> 16:22.527
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane...?

16:22.689 --> 16:23.883
- Hi.
- Hi, Roy.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.960
- How you doing?
- Come on back.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.040
I have a patient, but she's under.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.044
- I don't even know what to say.
- Me neither.

16:31.209 --> 16:33.962
- I knew this would happen.
- Me too.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.245
I mean, the whole thing, it's just...

16:38.409 --> 16:40.798
- Tragic.
- Well, it's not tragic.

16:40.969 --> 16:42.925
- No?
- No. It's...

16:43.089 --> 16:45.478
- Unsettling?
- Okay.

16:45.649 --> 16:49.528
- I mean, what if they...?
- I hope you're both happy.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.638
I'm not happy.

16:54.329 --> 16:57.480
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.

16:59.849 --> 17:02.761
I mean, I'm happy sometimes,
but not now.

17:02.929 --> 17:04.999
In college, maybe.

17:05.249 --> 17:08.685
- Those were fun times.
- Yeah, college was fun.

17:09.409 --> 17:12.765
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

17:15.049 --> 17:17.926
- Don't mind her.
- Oh, please. I love her.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.683
I've just met her,
but I'm very impressed.

17:20.848 --> 17:23.602
I've never had a problem
with these notes before.

17:23.769 --> 17:25.281
What's gonna happen now?

17:25.449 --> 17:28.839
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

17:29.009 --> 17:30.522
What? The physical therapist? Why?

17:30.689 --> 17:33.362
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

17:37.729 --> 17:38.923
How you doing?

17:42.569 --> 17:44.525
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

17:44.689 --> 17:47.203
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

17:47.369 --> 17:48.848
I'm sorry. She's not in.

17:49.009 --> 17:51.569
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.162
I told you she's not here.

17:53.329 --> 17:54.887
Look, you have to leave.

17:55.049 --> 17:56.482
Wait a second. Don't you...?

17:56.649 --> 17:58.765
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think...

17:58.929 --> 18:00.362
- Please.
- But, you see...

18:00.529 --> 18:03.202
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently...

18:03.369 --> 18:05.963
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

18:06.449 --> 18:07.723
Can't you listen to me?

18:07.889 --> 18:10.608
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.038
Call the police.

18:12.889 --> 18:14.481
The police.

18:14.649 --> 18:15.968
What is the...?

18:16.129 --> 18:17.642
Hi, George.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.248
Hello.

18:21.329 --> 18:22.762
Raymond?

18:26.409 --> 18:29.162
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

18:29.329 --> 18:30.762
It's a slap on the wrist.

18:30.929 --> 18:33.887
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

18:34.689 --> 18:36.998
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.365
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.

18:42.409 --> 18:43.683
Of what?

18:46.729 --> 18:49.402
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

18:49.569 --> 18:50.797
I said, "Get out of here.

18:50.969 --> 18:53.005
What do you want?
You don't belong here."

18:53.169 --> 18:55.888
- What do they do?
- They talk back.

18:56.049 --> 18:58.119
They go, " Hey, George,
how's it going?"

18:58.289 --> 19:00.678
I said, "Get the hell out of here."

19:00.849 --> 19:02.840
Hey, it's the K-Man.

19:06.929 --> 19:08.840
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

19:09.169 --> 19:11.558
Oh, man.

19:13.809 --> 19:15.959
Just came from Roy's.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.288
I threw up from the gas.

19:22.449 --> 19:25.566
- Did he say anything?
- No, no. He's fine.

19:27.169 --> 19:29.160
Oh, my God. It's...

19:29.329 --> 19:31.684
- What?
- Joe DiMaggio.

19:32.009 --> 19:34.364
Having a cup of coffee.

19:34.929 --> 19:36.999
- And he's dunking.
- Yeah.

19:38.729 --> 19:40.321
Look at him.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.923
The Yankee Clipper.

19:43.089 --> 19:44.363
Here.

19:44.569 --> 19:47.527
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

19:53.209 --> 19:54.437
Oh, please.

19:54.609 --> 19:56.725
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

20:04.969 --> 20:06.687
See? I told you.

20:06.849 --> 20:08.202
What causes homophobia?

20:08.369 --> 20:12.760
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

20:12.969 --> 20:17.167
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

20:17.329 --> 20:19.399
...we have weak sales resistance.

20:19.809 --> 20:23.006
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

20:23.449 --> 20:27.044
Men think, "Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

20:27.249 --> 20:30.366
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

20:30.529 --> 20:32.759
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

20:32.929 --> 20:36.888
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

20:37.489 --> 20:39.719
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

20:41.169 --> 20:43.399
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?"'
