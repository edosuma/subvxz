LITTLE VACUUMS?

36:43.632 --> 36:47.836

HE THINKS YOU CAN HANDLE.

36:47.836 --> 36:51.209

YEAH. RIGHT.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.963
I SNAPPED AT YOU
LIKE A JERK
AT THE HOSPITAL.

37:14.963 --> 37:16.405
LOOK, ANDI.

37:16.405 --> 37:18.567
I'M REALLY SORRY, OK,

37:18.567 --> 37:21.470
AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO ME ANYMORE,

37:21.470 --> 37:24.373
BUT I REALLY HOPE YOU WILL
BECAUSE MY LIFE

WRECKED IT YET.

37:40.389 --> 37:42.291
OH, GOOD.
YEAH.

37:42.291 --> 37:43.732
WHAT DOES
THIS SYMBOL MEAN?

37:43.732 --> 37:46.635
IT SAYS, "BALA."
IT'S SANSKRIT
FOR "STRENGTH."

37:46.635 --> 37:49.267
I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN I SAW IT,
I THOUGHT OF YOU...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.371
AND, BY THE WAY,
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
A LOSER, SAM.

WELL, YEAH.

38:57.005 --> 38:59.368
WELL, I MEAN,
TECHNICALLY, NOT FOREVER.

A BUNCH OF CRAP

39:05.043 --> 39:07.476
AND GAVE YOU THE SALE
FOR THE CONTEST.

39:07.476 --> 39:11.820

REALLY ANGRY.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.606

IT'S A VICTORY HAM.

BACK TO HELL, BUDDY.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.984

BECAUSE IT'S
THE SPOILS OF VICTORY.

PLUS, IT'S GLAZED.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.419
DO YOU LIKE THAT?
GLAZED? FUNNY, RIGHT?

39:50.419 --> 39:53.592

TO THE DEVIL,

39:55.524 --> 39:57.065

INDENTURED SERVANT.

39:57.065 --> 39:57.926
HOW CRAZY IS THAT?

39:57.926 --> 40:01.570

ME UP FROM SLEEPAWAY
CAMP FOR 3 DAYS.

HARDLY THE SAME
THING, SOCK.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.774
CAMP WAS OVER, SAM.
HOW SAD IS THAT?

40:05.774 --> 40:09.478
ANYWAY, YOU CAN BLOW
THE WHOLE THING OFF,
IF YOU WANT TO, SAMMY.

40:09.478 --> 40:10.939
JUST TELL THE DEVIL
TO EAT IT.

40:10.939 --> 40:13.582
IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU
DON'T WANT TO DO, THEN
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.

40:13.582 --> 40:15.984
NO, BUT I THINK I DO.
I THINK I WANT TO.
YEAH?

40:15.984 --> 40:19.748
AFTER ALL THIS, IT'S LIKE
I FEEL LIKE A GROWNUP KIND OF.

40:19.748 --> 40:24.052
