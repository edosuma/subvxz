02:18.805 --> 02:20.723
We had Doom Dog.

02:20.723 --> 02:24.143
We had him, and he slipped
right through our fingers!

02:27.063 --> 02:30.358
Doom Dog is the most
powerful villain we've ever faced...

02:30.358 --> 02:34.237
...but one of these days
he'll make a mistake and we'll catch him.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.365
Yeah, so don't take it out on the forklift.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.242
Sorry.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.619
Sometimes I get...

02:41.619 --> 02:43.162
...a little angry.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.586
Amazing Acquaintances...

02:49.586 --> 02:52.005
...present rings.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.472
Thomas, guard the rings.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
You're in charge.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.202
Those rings will be mine.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.597
Yoo-hoo.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.788
Phew.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.332
Phew.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.218
I am Doom Dog...

06:25.218 --> 06:29.555
...and I will destroy all who keep me
from the rings of power.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.517
And that means you.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.869
Thanks, it was feeling
a little chilly in here.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.214
If youse two can't stop fighting
between yourselves...

07:03.214 --> 07:05.007
...how are you gonna stop me?

07:19.897 --> 07:21.023
Doom Dog?

07:21.023 --> 07:22.525
He's been captured.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.777
How did he get in here?

07:27.196 --> 07:30.241
Are you responsible for this?

07:31.868 --> 07:34.412
Thomas, you defeated Doom Dog?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.706
All by yourself?

07:46.048 --> 07:49.510
Whoa. I guess you had some help.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.370
Oh, yes!

08:17.538 --> 08:20.458
Yes! Ha-ha! Yes!

08:21.042 --> 08:22.293
It is finished.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.795
My greatest invention ever.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.090
The velocity-enhancing,
speed-altering Ultra-Zapper!

08:38.893 --> 08:40.811
My masterpiece.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.439
Now I need my test subject.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.164
What are you doing?

09:00.164 --> 09:01.207
Get to work.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.476
Don't worry.
Not a slowpoke for long, Mr. Turtle.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.858
Commence my experiment.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.543
That mouse
is now a part of my experiment.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.752
Get him, Tom!

10:10.026 --> 10:13.154
Go and catch that mouse!

11:02.161 --> 11:04.789
Hey, you saved my life.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.624
You're my hero.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.216
<i>Jerry!</i>

12:44.472 --> 12:45.890
Our little hero.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.560
Ain't nothing could ever slow
that Jerry down.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.565
<i>Slow that Jerry down.</i>

13:29.350 --> 13:30.643
Oh.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.896
Now, that is one colorful balloon.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.328
Now, that is one colorful
but out-of-control balloon.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.259
Ooh! An Ultra-Zapper.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.303
I always wanted one of them.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.332
Hey, Jerry, you're the hero.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.501
Wanna play? It's fun.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.131
All right, more fun for me.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.624
<i>Help! Help!</i>

15:19.668 --> 15:21.920
Oh, dear! Oh, please! Please! Help!

15:21.920 --> 15:25.174
<i>Help me! Somebody help me!
Down, doggy! Down! Down!</i>

15:25.174 --> 15:28.093
No, no! Please, help me! Please!
Somebody help--!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.554
Oh, not the mail! Don't touch the mail!

15:38.520 --> 15:40.939
Thanks, Power Tom.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.335
Thanks, Power Tom.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.299
<i>Thomas! Thomas!</i>

16:08.801 --> 16:11.553
Thomas?
Thomas? Thomas!

16:11.553 --> 16:15.432
Dreaming again, aren't you, Thomas?
Lazy good-for-nothing.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.810
Oh, why don't you
do something constructive...

16:17.810 --> 16:20.938
...like catch that blasted mouse.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.066
Why I even have a cat sure beats me.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.153
Well, I'm off to do some shopping.
Be back later tonight.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.511
<i>Power Gal...</i>

18:57.511 --> 18:59.805
<i>...a robbery is in progress
at the national bank.</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:01.139
<i>Apprehend suspects.</i>

19:01.139 --> 19:05.978
<i>The bank is in the Quimby District.
Coordinates downloading to GPS.</i>

19:09.773 --> 19:13.819
Cucamonga.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.949
It pays to be a cat burglar.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.581
Eh...

20:07.581 --> 20:10.125
Home, Jeeves.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.045
Uh?

20:42.032 --> 20:45.243
And don't forget your stamp.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.545
Power Gal?
Stop right there, cat burglars.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.642
I'll take my power suit back,
thank you very much.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.773
Cucamonga!

21:35.085 --> 21:37.462
Hello, kitty, I'm home.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.134
Still on the couch, huh, Thomas?

21:47.389 --> 21:50.100
<i>The two vanished

21:50.100 --> 21:52.978
<i>Who are these heroic vigilantes?</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:58.692
Thomas, why can't you do something
heroic like that once in a while?
