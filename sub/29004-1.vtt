00:11.746 --> 00:13.512
- Without you watching this
video,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.347
my life would be without
purpose.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.516
So depressing.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.522
Firstly, I just want to say
thank you,

00:23.524 --> 00:26.358
thank you so much for...

00:29.597 --> 00:30.429
Gah, cunt.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.262
Hey, guys, how you guys doing
tonight?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.131
Louie here.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.233
First things, first.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.667
Happy New Year!

00:35.669 --> 00:37.736
I'm just so blooming excited.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.072
I feel like I should be
drinking champagne or something

00:40.074 --> 00:43.342
in this video, or dropping
like a miniature ball.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.461
Yeah, that's great.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.579
A graphic of ball dropping.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.481
Put my face on it maybe.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.816
Yeah, I like that.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.386
...For watching as always,
but especially today

00:54.388 --> 00:55.687
because...

00:57.324 --> 00:58.590
Can't find the fucking...

00:58.592 --> 01:01.727
Because, drum roll!

01:01.729 --> 01:05.096
Yesterday we hit our goal
of 4 million subscribers!

01:07.167 --> 01:09.234
You guys really are the
best, but now, as promised,

01:09.236 --> 01:10.803
on to my annual New Year's post.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.738
It's the second so you've
gotta give me credit

01:12.740 --> 01:15.107
for getting it in before Good
Friday.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.810
Add the graphics.

01:17.812 --> 01:18.744
Celebratory music.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.580
Um.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.848
Yeah, that's it.

01:24.518 --> 01:29.321
Alright so, first
question is from Mildred.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.390
Oh, Mildred.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.258
That's my Mum's name.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.463
Wait, Mum, is that you?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.631
Alright, so what's your
New Year's revolution?

01:42.536 --> 01:44.203
What?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.438
It's two o'clock in the morning.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.406
Then...

01:49.543 --> 01:50.809
Come on, wake up, dude!

01:53.747 --> 01:55.714
Think, hot coffee.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.183
Cold water!

01:58.886 --> 02:00.285
Cold water!

02:00.287 --> 02:01.353
Ah.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.859
So, Mildred asks what's
your New Year's resolution?

02:06.861 --> 02:08.160
Well, Mildred.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.632
I'll be tackling cooking this
year.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.601
My girlfriend got me this
slow cooker for Christmas

02:15.603 --> 02:18.604
and I intend to slowly cook a
lot.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.772
I actually signed up for a class

02:20.774 --> 02:22.774
'cause I have no idea
how to cut vegetables

02:22.776 --> 02:24.309
and that was completely rubbish

02:24.311 --> 02:26.245
so you can cut that last line.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.549
For me, if the first step
isn't remove from package

02:30.551 --> 02:32.384
and the second step isn't put in
microwave

02:32.386 --> 02:34.920
then I have no idea what I'm
doing so.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.890
I signed up for a class
because I don't have any idea

02:37.892 --> 02:39.391
how to use a knife.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.259
- I do!

02:40.261 --> 02:41.627
- Yo, what the fuck!

03:06.187 --> 03:07.920
Okay, no, no, no, no, please,
please.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.694
- Wait.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.744
Action.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.697
- Can we watch it?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.269
- Ah.
- Finally!

03:57.271 --> 03:58.337
- Wow.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.571
- We're here!
- I love it.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.906
- This place is huge!

04:00.908 --> 04:02.407
- Yes.
- It's cozy, right?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.709
- Stop.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.244
- It looks kinda haunted.
- Come on.

04:05.246 --> 04:05.944
- I'm just kidding.

04:05.946 --> 04:06.812
- I tried.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.163
- It's not haunted.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.513
- Of course not.
- Look, we have a lion.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.482
- Not bad, right?
- One lion.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.017
Only one lion?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.518
- Do you know if it's in
operation or not?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.686
- Oh my God, Doogie.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.355
- I'm all right.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.822
- Sorry, Doug.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.290
- How 'bout, no, accidents on
day one.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.325
- I should probably--
- Chill out.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.510
- Yeah.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.694
I'll get down, I'll get down.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.296
- They gave me a key.
- What do you think?

04:24.298 --> 04:25.430
- No, clearly I do.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.182
- It's unlocked.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.933
Yeah, they gave me a
key, but it's not, look.

04:28.936 --> 04:29.801
- Okay.
- Well, let's check it out.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.336
- How very inviting, huh?

04:31.338 --> 04:32.588
- Right.

04:32.589 --> 04:33.839
- Welcome, welcome to
Cribs!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.407
Some stranger's house.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.510
We got this chest from
the deck of the Titanic

04:38.512 --> 04:41.413
and we keep our most valuable...

04:42.516 --> 04:43.448
...pine cones.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.952
This chandelier also from... the
Titanic.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.689
Wicker basket, you guessed
it, from the Titanic.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.324
And...

04:53.294 --> 04:54.593
What the fuck?

04:54.595 --> 04:57.596
This lamp, it looks like a lamp,

04:57.598 --> 05:00.399
but it's actually a tiny house.

05:01.935 --> 05:02.868
What?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.604
I can't even, with these
paintings?

05:14.882 --> 05:18.450
And now our most exquisite room.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.557
- Whatcha you doin'?

05:25.559 --> 05:26.958
- It's locked.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.860
- Yeah, probably for good
reason.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.662
Wanna come help us unload?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.596
Chop chop!

05:35.102 --> 05:36.919
- Hey.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.737
I feel like Belle from
Beauty and the Beast.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.673
- Well, you definitely
look more like the beast.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.091
- You're gonna cringe at the
joke

05:43.092 --> 05:44.508
when you're going through
the footage later.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.678
- Hey, Aaron, will you help
get the food from the car,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.080
and then start dinner with
Joanna?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.481
Me and Doug will take care of
gear.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.683
- You don't want a
man to do the heavy lifting?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
- Uh, no, she wants
a man to do the cooking

05:53.487 --> 05:54.720
and cleaning, Belle.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.355
- Okay.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.656
Now, that just makes you look
stupid

05:57.658 --> 06:01.059
because Belle had like an
army of ka-ramic slaves

06:01.061 --> 06:02.961
doing everything for her.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.012
Uh huh.

06:04.013 --> 06:05.062
- Do you mean ceramic?

06:08.569 --> 06:09.634
- All done?

06:09.636 --> 06:11.403
- Um, yes and no.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.438
- What do you mean?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.407
- Well, it means nobody's home,
Robin.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.908
Doesn't matter how many
of these I drop off.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.110
- Yeah, I mean, but a lot
of the scenes are at night.

06:18.112 --> 06:19.612
We can't be getting--

06:19.613 --> 06:21.113
- Well, I know but this is a
winter town

06:21.114 --> 06:22.614
and it's summer so the people
who probably own these homes

06:22.616 --> 06:24.583
are at their beach houses or
something.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.385
- Yeah, but if we get
interruptions and we're supposed--

06:26.387 --> 06:28.587
- We won't get any interruptions,
are you kidding me?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.589
- Uh, guys, they left a note.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.090
Ready?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.425
Cody, you ready, okay.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.628
Dear cast and crew of Lover's
Weekend,

06:36.630 --> 06:38.063
hope the trip was safe.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.866
We left a case of beers in the
fridge.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.718
Yes!

06:42.719 --> 06:44.569
May your journey toward truth
take you

06:44.571 --> 06:45.871
to unexpected places.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.539
Sincerely, the Havermans.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.409
P.S., we don't internet,
service is shoddy,

06:50.411 --> 06:52.611
but house phone works.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.680
And there's a quote at the
bottom, which I'll let you read.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.984
- "What is filmmaking
but groping in the dark?"

06:58.986 --> 07:00.085
Alexander Payne.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.028
Ugh, so much fuzz.
- Got a hair on there?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.096
I don't think, anyone's gonna
see that.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.197
- I wanna look.
- Robin.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.799
- I wanna look put together!

07:13.801 --> 07:15.784
- You always look put
together.

07:15.785 --> 07:17.768
It's like your life is put
together.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.703
- Thank you.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.172
- You shoot your
first feature tomorrow.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.774
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me about it.

07:22.776 --> 07:27.045
- Okay, yeah, so it's about
me and my boyfriend, both.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.780
Well, my boyfriend, it's about
both of us.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.998
It's about.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.215
Sorry, okay, I'm gonna
start again, I can't...

07:31.218 --> 07:32.651
- You are awful at this.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.119
- I'm really bad at pitching,
okay.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.804
- Yeah, clearly.
- Okay.

07:35.805 --> 07:37.488
- Your husband
is your only investor.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.924
- Hey, hey, hey, don't spoil the
movie.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.026
- Binny, this is a
behind-the-scenes documentary.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.162
If someone watches this
like before the actual film

07:44.164 --> 07:45.831
they're sociopaths.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.499
- Still I have to explain
the plot first so.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.617
Context.

07:48.618 --> 07:49.734
- Yeah, I'm painfully
aware of that fact.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.903
- Okay, okay, geez.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.673
So this movie is about a
long weekend that I spent

07:54.675 --> 07:57.042
with my boyfriend at the time.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.543
Now husband.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.511
- Ooh.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.579
- I'm getting to...

08:00.581 --> 08:01.646
I'm gettin' to the bones.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.582
Okay.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.517
- Good morning.
- Jesus.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.718
Oh, you scared me.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.821
You found Cody's camera.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.224
Well, she was interested in

08:12.226 --> 08:13.758
behind-the-scenes footage.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.694
Might be useful.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.097
You okay?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.866
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.634
Just trying to be helpful.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.705
- That's all you've been doing.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.608
None of this would be
possible without you.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.909
I very much appreciate it.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.011
That feels surprisingly nice.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.248
You are one lucky woman.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.102
- Now go on.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.919
You said I could paint
without any distractions.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.023
But he actually found
out both of his parents

08:45.025 --> 08:47.225
were killed on a car
crash on Christmas day.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.694
And, yeah, we got snowed
in that day and, anyway.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.831
Secrets were shared and like,
our relationship evolved.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.666
It was, yeah, it was, you know.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.834
And then more time.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.001
- Tell them about the
house.

08:57.004 --> 08:57.869
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.255
We won a contest.

09:00.256 --> 09:02.640
Yeah, um, this film, this
couple they love film

09:02.643 --> 09:06.177
or whatever and they ran
a contest for a filmmaker

09:06.179 --> 09:08.179
to come and shoot at their
winter home.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.749
I just had to write about
my passion for film.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.651
- They didn't want
to know about the film?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.953
- No, I wrote a little about it
but,

09:14.954 --> 09:17.254
no, they wanted to know about
the filmmaker, specifically.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.224
- What'd you write about?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.725
- I don't really remember.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.294
Kinda just did it on a whim, you
know?

09:22.296 --> 09:23.328
I didn't think.
- Ooh.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.796
Just did it on a whim!

09:24.798 --> 09:26.164
- Oh yeah.
- No big deal.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.032
Brush it off the shoulders.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.133
- Yeah.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.801
- Okay, introduce the
crew.

09:29.803 --> 09:30.735
- Okay, yeah.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.455
- There's Aaron.

09:33.456 --> 09:35.339
He's very um, passionate about
his craft.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.108
He's a friend from college.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.945
- I was 15 and my buddy
pulls out this photo

09:39.947 --> 09:43.014
and it's literally a picture
of a penguin's butthole

09:43.016 --> 09:44.783
that's taking a poop.
- What?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.685
- And he drew little eyes on
top of it and a little mouth.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.853
- Gross.
- And it looks like a little.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.855
- How do you even
find a penguin butthole

09:50.857 --> 09:52.257
to take a picture?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.126
- And then there's
Joanna.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.994
And she doesn't look
anything like me, obviously,

09:55.996 --> 09:57.228
but she had the best performance

09:57.230 --> 09:59.130
and I really wanted to cast
based on that.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.232
She was, oh, she was awesome.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.035
And then there's Doogie, or
Doug.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.171
I guess he
insists on being called now.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.773
We have known him since
kindergarten, mm-hmm.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.042
Forever.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.310
And then there's you,
my sweet baby sister.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.879
- Mm.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.048
- Rockin' the behind-the-scenes.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.083
And that's it.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.384
Yeah, we're small.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.852
- Sweet, okay.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.154
Um, I think I'm gonna take this
audio

10:23.156 --> 10:24.356
and then I'm gonna lay it over
the footage

10:24.358 --> 10:25.858
that we got in the van this
morning.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.359
I think that will look pretty
cool.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.994
- Okay.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.261
- You don't like that.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.696
- I said okay.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.130
- Yeah, but you made the
face.

10:33.133 --> 10:33.999
- What face?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.417
I didn't make a face.

10:35.418 --> 10:36.834
- No, you make the
face that Mom always makes

10:36.837 --> 10:38.487
when she thinks I'm making...
- Okay.

10:38.488 --> 10:40.138
- Bad choices.
- Well, you do that face too.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.239
Plenty of times.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.339
- So you admit you made
the face?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.241
- Oh shit.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.110
Caught in a lie.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.911
I'll look at it, but, I don't
know.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.213
It kinda feels a little hokey.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.132
Don't you think?

10:50.133 --> 10:52.050
My thoughts on documentary
are a little more, you know,

10:52.052 --> 10:53.885
like Maysles' brothers.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.719
Like let the story just kind of
happen.

10:55.722 --> 10:56.855
Don't like, try to.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.523
- What story?

10:58.524 --> 11:00.190
I'm not trying to shoot some
award winning documentary here.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.960
I'm just trying to get some,
like bonus

11:01.962 --> 11:03.728
feature DVD kind of stuff.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.198
- Well, I don't know.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.232
I thought your perspective
on the whole thing

11:07.233 --> 11:08.266
would be really interesting.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.901
Maybe you wanna explore that.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.204
- Why explore
something so disturbing?

11:16.677 --> 11:19.444
No, but seriously, get my
camera away from the water.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.146
I am terrified!

11:21.147 --> 11:22.847
That is my soul you're holding,
come on.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.948
Can you get me a beer?

11:23.950 --> 11:24.866
No, no!

11:24.867 --> 11:25.783
Get that way from the hot tub.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.018
- Never!

11:27.387 --> 11:28.720
- That's my baby!

11:28.722 --> 11:30.221
- Come on! Speech!

11:30.223 --> 11:31.222
- Hey, are you ready, are you
ready?

11:31.223 --> 11:32.222
- Yes, ready, thank you.
- Yes, yes.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.060
- Alright.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.896
Okay, first I would like to
thank everyone for being here.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.966
Having you all here
couldn't make me happier.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.034
No I really, seriously,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.869
I couldn't spare a single one of
you.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.807
You're a part of something
that I really believe in

11:48.809 --> 11:51.209
and I think, hopefully,
you believe in too.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.044
- Don't cry.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.246
- I'm not, it's the water!

11:56.016 --> 11:57.382
- I need to get through this.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.416
- Okay, shh.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.252
- No, this is, this is...

12:01.254 --> 12:04.155
You have no idea how
important it is for me

12:04.157 --> 12:05.573
to tell this story.

12:05.574 --> 12:06.990
And you guys are each doing
like four or five jobs

12:06.993 --> 12:11.062
and that's to help me get to
tell it so.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.048
Just, thank you.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.033
From the bottom of my
heart, so much gratitude.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.835
- We appreciate you--
- Cheers!

12:16.837 --> 12:18.303
- Cheers!

12:21.808 --> 12:22.941
- What is that?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.021
Joanna, you awake?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.991
First shot of the moviola!

13:19.532 --> 13:21.165
- You like the makeshift
dolly I have for the scene?

13:21.168 --> 13:22.534
- It's all right,
it's a little sketchy.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.069
Look how into it she is.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.754
Prepped.

13:26.755 --> 13:28.438
Letting nothing infringe on her
focus.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.574
- Grab the boom please.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.842
- Yes!
- Thank you.

13:30.844 --> 13:31.910
Let's do it.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.545
- Okay, okay, okay.

13:33.547 --> 13:34.813
Rolling.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.414
- Scene 17, take one.

13:42.856 --> 13:43.588
Action.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.962
- Wow.

13:52.899 --> 13:53.832
- You like it?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.234
- It's beautiful.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.003
Must have cost a fortune.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.306
- We never get away and I
thought...

14:02.843 --> 14:04.375
Shit, line!

14:04.377 --> 14:05.343
- Cut.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.344
- Okay.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.048
- Wow.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.884
- You like it?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.252
- It's beautiful.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.272
It must have cost a fortune.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.223
- Well, we've never really
been on vacation before.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.258
- Okay, back to one.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.492
- Seriously?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.211
- Did I say the wrong line?

14:23.212 --> 14:24.528
- Yeah, no, it's not a huge
deal.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.933
I like the tone, but that
wording is really important--

14:28.935 --> 14:29.601
- Cutting camera.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.102
- I just couldn't sleep.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.372
- Yeah, was it that
noise?

14:35.475 --> 14:37.475
- No, what noise?

14:37.477 --> 14:41.112
- I don't know, just
something weird in the woods.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.447
But why couldn't you sleep?

14:44.284 --> 14:47.185
- My friend from high
school died recently.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.221
- Aaron, I'm so sorry.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.491
- It was some undiagnosed
stomach issue.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.194
It just happened in his sleep.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.629
- Geez.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.063
- What kind of
person do you have to be

14:59.065 --> 15:01.599
to write a goodbye on
someone's Facebook wall?

15:01.601 --> 15:05.036
Like to assume that there's an
afterlife

15:05.038 --> 15:08.539
and that afterlife is so boring
the person

15:08.541 --> 15:09.863
wants to check Facebook.

15:09.864 --> 15:11.186
- That's
what kept you up at night?

15:11.187 --> 15:12.509
That and my never ending

15:12.512 --> 15:13.478
fear of mortality.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.515
Wait, what was that noise you
were talking about before?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.184
- Animal maybe?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.219
- Doing what?

15:21.221 --> 15:22.086
- I don't know.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.321
- No, it's too repetitive.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.089
It has to be human.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.324
- Alright, guys, let's do this.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.392
Let's get back to work.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.459
- Well, I don't want
to freak you out but--

15:28.460 --> 15:29.526
- Aaron, feeling better?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.129
- Oh, yeah, yeah, much better.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.030
Food really helped.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.348
- Awesome, sweet.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.665
- It's not out of the
realm of possibility.

15:34.668 --> 15:35.567
- Uh, hey, can we?

15:35.568 --> 15:36.467
- It's a densely wooded area

15:36.469 --> 15:37.602
they're known to be nocturnal.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.270
- Doug, can we be good to go in
10?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.538
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Awesome.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.670
- You hear that?

15:55.671 --> 15:56.954
- Yeah. It's louder this
time.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.958
- It's that noise again.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.696
Someone chopping wood.

16:04.698 --> 16:05.730
- Really?

16:05.732 --> 16:06.664
- Yeah.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.667
- Who chops wood at 2AM?

16:11.137 --> 16:13.104
- I don't know,
but that's what it is.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.539
- How do you know?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.708
- I grew up in the
mountains.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.309
- Serious?
- Yeah.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.177
- For some reason I
thought you

16:19.179 --> 16:20.979
grew up in hotel.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.182
- Okay, no one grows up
in hotel.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.384
- Tell that to the kid
from Dunston Checks In.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.318
- Guys.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.690
- I'm gonna say something.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.559
- No, don't, no, no, no.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.594
- Hey!

16:36.595 --> 16:38.628
Do your chores during the
day like everyone else!

16:39.532 --> 16:40.465
Hello?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.568
Anyone out there?

16:45.572 --> 16:46.704
- Seriously?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.506
Guys, we have to be up in three
hours.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.510
- Sorry, man.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.577
Well, good night, you fuckin'
weirdo.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.651
- I mean, I like what he's
doing.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.285
He's just trying to make it
naturalistic for his character.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.654
- I know, and I trust you, I
really do.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.089
I just think, you know, you
wrote

17:05.090 --> 17:06.758
all these natural flourishes and
I just.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.291
- I know the lines.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.529
- I'm not saying that
you don't.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.364
- That's not really the problem.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.333
- Robin, Can we talk about
the mantle piece for a minute?

17:15.335 --> 17:16.501
I just feel like it's a
little bare considering--

17:16.502 --> 17:17.535
- I'm trying to talk to my
actors.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.547
- But I'm taking about--

17:18.548 --> 17:19.558
- You said you could do this.

17:19.559 --> 17:20.569
- I said that we could do this.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.117
- You need to get the cues so
that

17:22.117 --> 17:23.662
she knows when to talk.
- I will, I'm gonna get 'em,

17:23.663 --> 17:25.207
- Oh great, now I look
like the difficult actress.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.611
- Drama!

17:27.047 --> 17:28.730
- Turn it off.

17:28.731 --> 17:30.414
- Ohhh, now I'm in the
drama!

17:30.417 --> 17:31.516
- Turn it off!

17:35.789 --> 17:40.058
- Hey, Cody, have you seen my
headphones?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.126
- No.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.363
- Uh oh.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.297
- What?

17:46.299 --> 17:52.270
- Aaron and I just have very
different approaches to acting.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.939
I'm classically trained and he--

17:54.940 --> 17:57.607
- And he's like never
even heard of Stanislavsky?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.112
- You said it, not me.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.414
- Look, I'm trying to
decide if I wanna say this

18:03.416 --> 18:04.549
on camera or not.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.716
I think it's a compliment,
but...

18:05.718 --> 18:08.986
- Oh, now you have to say
it.

18:08.987 --> 18:12.255
- I read your sister's
script and... I just knew.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.662
It's really honest.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.465
It's really rare.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.334
Are you okay with how honest it
is?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.485
- Yeah, it's totally
fine.

18:24.486 --> 18:25.635
It's not a big deal.
- Yeah?

18:26.806 --> 18:27.738
Because...

18:31.478 --> 18:33.544
We shoot that scene tomorrow
and it's really intense.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.179
I know you're gonna be watching.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.814
- I guess I need to know
that you're gonna be

18:36.816 --> 18:37.882
comfortable with it.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.321
- Robin and I haven't
been talking for a while.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.255
I don't know.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.493
She kind of sent this script
as like an olive branch.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.863
And you're right.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.598
It was just brutally honest in
ways

18:53.600 --> 18:55.633
that she had never been before.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.869
So I'm not just okay with it.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.537
I'm happy it exists.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.471
- Good.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.875
'Cause I think it's gonna be
really good.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.062
All right, I gotta get back in
there.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.479
- Hey, I have an
extra pair of headphones

19:09.482 --> 19:11.449
if you wanna use them.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.583
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.451
- You're not using them?

19:13.453 --> 19:14.852
- No.

19:14.854 --> 19:15.720
- Thank you!

19:15.722 --> 19:17.439
Okay, you're a life saver.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.157
I have this playlist I
like to listen to before

19:19.159 --> 19:19.891
to get me in...

19:20.860 --> 19:21.726
- Not now, Cody.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.894
- Mm, come on.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.329
I gotta get your thoughts.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.900
- My thoughts are that
we just lost half a day

19:28.902 --> 19:30.768
from that argument and I
gotta figure out what scenes

19:30.770 --> 19:32.470
we can lose to make up for it.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.438
- If you don't wanna talk
about it,

19:34.440 --> 19:38.509
I'm thinkin' that I should see
that essay.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.128
- What essay?

19:40.129 --> 19:41.746
- The one that you
wrote to get to this house.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.465
I mean, like to win this.

19:43.466 --> 19:45.183
I was thinking that, you
know, if it's good enough

19:45.185 --> 19:47.185
then I could read it out loud.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.553
- No, no, no.
- Then I'm gonna cut it in

19:48.554 --> 19:49.920
with the last--
- I don't have it any more.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.287
- Well, it must be
in your email or something.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.890
You must have it somewhere?
- Cody, no.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.359
- I'll go talk to Doogie
then.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.827
- Oh, can you not please?

19:56.829 --> 20:00.431
He's finding all of
this very overwhelming.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.368
- Well, if you
need someone else on set

20:04.370 --> 20:05.870
why don't you just call your
husband?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.605
I mean, Max is probably
available.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.540
- We're kind of on a break right
now.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.614
No, not a break, we're just
using the time

20:16.616 --> 20:18.282
apart to think about...

20:21.688 --> 20:22.620
Uh, will you delete that?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.255
Actually, what I just said?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.623
I shouldn't...

20:25.625 --> 20:26.857
It's not what I meant.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.209
- Yeah.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.560
- Will you do it now please?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.962
- Yeah, yeah, got you.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.932
- Please, I don't want the
chance of him hearing it.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.500
Will you just do it?

20:37.237 --> 20:39.337
- Yeah, I'll delete it
right now.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.016
- What the fuck are you doing?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.888
If something's wrong, I
said to come talk to me.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.825
You know that.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.026
- There's nothing wrong.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.030
- Good.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.833
I brought you something.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.704
Where are your manners?

21:14.874 --> 21:15.973
- Can I have it please?

21:19.545 --> 21:21.646
What did you bring me?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.449
- Please and thank you.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.618
- Thank you so much, it means a
lot.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.054
- Okay, open it.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.560
- Well, what is it?

21:36.562 --> 21:38.029
- She's drawing now.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.419
- Okay.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.470
- You see, I think she still
loves you.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.044
- I don't know.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.379
I mean, it's pretty verbatim.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.448
- He actually said these things
to you?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.518
- He was lashing out
at whoever was close to him.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.603
- Okay.

22:01.604 --> 22:02.687
I mean, it just, it kinda
seems like he's being

22:02.689 --> 22:04.506
a bit condescending.

22:04.507 --> 22:06.324
- Yeah, his world just ended,
right?

22:06.326 --> 22:08.793
His reactions are not gonna
be the normal Max reactions.

22:08.795 --> 22:11.346
- Yeah.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.898
- Hey, it's a pretty big scene
today.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.700
I'm sure I can manage here
without you.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.902
- No, no, no, no,
I want to help, Doug.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.870
- Alright.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.640
In that case I gotta put
a bigger light in here

22:22.642 --> 22:23.752
if you wouldn't mind.

22:23.753 --> 22:24.863
- Oh yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

22:24.864 --> 22:25.974
Just need to give it a little
tug here

22:25.978 --> 22:28.646
and you should be good.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.680
- Ooh, pro.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.849
- Like a pro.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.668
- Hey, you okay?

22:33.669 --> 22:35.486
- Yeah, yeah, I was just
helping him Doog-- Doug

22:36.422 --> 22:37.521
- Mind if I use your camera?

22:37.523 --> 22:38.389
I wanna get a second angle.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.056
- Yeah, of course.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.091
- Thank you.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.027
Action.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.863
- I need you to be open right
now, Robin.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.797
For me.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.968
I can't handle this
emotional shutdown, okay?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.770
If you have something to say to
me,

22:52.772 --> 22:55.873
if you have something to tell
me then just fucking say it!

23:04.984 --> 23:08.753
- My Dad would molest my
sister in front of me.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.687
- What?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.791
- He would say if you tell on
anyone

23:13.793 --> 23:15.659
then I'll do the same thing to
you.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.897
He made me stay in the room
every time.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.099
I think just to keep the fear
fresh.

23:24.470 --> 23:27.705
It worked 'cause you're the
first person I'm telling.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.912
And the only reason it stopped

23:34.914 --> 23:36.881
is because he died of a heart
attack.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.653
He would make me turn
on a movie full volume

23:42.655 --> 23:43.854
I think, so my Mom couldn't
here.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.960
I should have stopped it, I
should have...

23:54.667 --> 23:55.766
- You're disgusting.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.570
- What?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.122
- How?

24:01.123 --> 24:02.673
How could you let that piece
of shit even do that to her?

24:03.576 --> 24:04.742
How could you let him?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.278
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.012
- Someone's at the door.

24:09.013 --> 24:10.746
- Cody, we're gonna look nuts
if we answer with a camera.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.916
Hey, don't say anything, okay?

24:11.918 --> 24:14.051
No macho confrontational
bullshit.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.224
Evening.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.625
- Good evening.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.894
You're not the Havermans.

24:23.896 --> 24:24.962
- No, no, we aren't,

24:24.964 --> 24:26.764
but they're letting us film
here.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.102
- I forgot my air freshener
here.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.905
- We're making a movie.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.212
- Oh.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.881
- Hey, um, where's your
car?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.984
- Is it pornography?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.687
- What, no, no, it's
not.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.988
It's um...

24:50.990 --> 24:53.491
No, it's a drama.

24:53.493 --> 24:58.529
- My husband wanted to
apologize for the other night.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.100
He doesn't sleep well like you
and I.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.871
- The chopping sound.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.572
- Oh.
- Yes.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.207
He chops wood.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.844
He has anxiety.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.580
- Who doesn't?

25:18.618 --> 25:19.550
- I don't.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.123
- I don't mean to be
like weird,

25:26.125 --> 25:28.859
but we were just in the
middle of shooting a scene.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.730
- Quite all right.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.265
I should get going anyhow.

25:34.267 --> 25:37.735
I have a long day tomorrow.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.237
- A long day.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.239
Well, you're welcome to
come to our wrap party.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.608
And we'd love to meet
your husband as well.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.250
- Nice to see y'all.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.720
- Thanks, have a nice night.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.026
You filmed that whole thing,
didn't you?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.761
- What's wrong with her?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.864
- Ugh, let's
just shoot this scene.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.333
I cannot do another 14-hour day.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.768
- Let's do this.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.724
Hey.

26:34.794 --> 26:35.993
- Hey.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.595
What are you doin'?

26:37.597 --> 26:38.996
- Just helping out a little.

26:38.998 --> 26:43.033
Well, I mean, it was a pretty
intense day, don't ya think?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.269
- Yeah.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.038
Yeah, that woman really creeped
me out.

26:49.342 --> 26:52.610
- I mean, she was a little weird
but like.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.347
I meant like the work we
did today... do you wanna--

26:56.349 --> 26:57.848
- that scene.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.249
- Have you locked the doors?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.320
I don't feel comfortable with
her around.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.722
You know what I mean?

27:06.025 --> 27:08.092
- Cody, I wanna talk about that
scene.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.296
- I really think we should lock
the doors.

27:19.905 --> 27:23.007
- I mean, is that really
what's bothering you?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.711
That was like some heavy stuff,
you know?

27:37.423 --> 27:38.355
What?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.697
- Hey.

27:46.699 --> 27:47.431
- It's closer.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.769
I'm gonna tell him to move, at
least.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.975
Hey, man, you're scaring people!

27:59.444 --> 28:00.910
You mind going closer to your
house?

28:06.318 --> 28:07.451
You're first...

28:07.453 --> 28:10.120
- What did he just say?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.696
- What the hell?

28:18.698 --> 28:20.364
- Are you fucking kidding
me?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.166
- Give me the camera.
- Aaron, don't--

28:22.168 --> 28:24.468
- I'm gonna stop this shit.
- Don't!

28:34.113 --> 28:35.279
- Got me chasing through
the woods

28:35.281 --> 28:37.181
in my fuckin' boxers!

29:58.063 --> 30:00.230
Show yourself, man.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.365
What the fuck?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.366
- Aaron!

30:09.408 --> 30:10.474
- What's wrong?

30:13.012 --> 30:13.944
What happened?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.079
- Someone--someone's inside.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.916
- Take this.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.265
Stop recording.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.368
Goodnight, see you in
the mornin'

30:38.370 --> 30:40.838
- I'm not sleeping
tonight.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.894
- They had to be
gluten-free too.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.561
- I'm telling you, someone
just didn't close the door

31:05.564 --> 31:06.864
and a critter walked in.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.165
- Okay, how can an animal open a
fridge?

31:13.105 --> 31:15.255
This isn't funny.

31:15.256 --> 31:17.406
- You don't know what could
be or could possibly not be.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.042
She said she saw something and
it may be,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.002
I don't know.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.961
We could go to town, I mean,
like,

31:20.962 --> 31:21.920
maybe this is like a thing here.

31:21.921 --> 31:22.879
- No, we can't do that.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.615
We're losing so much day light.

31:24.617 --> 31:25.482
- Are you...

31:25.484 --> 31:26.516
Are you filming right now?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.319
Will you excuse us for a second?

31:37.529 --> 31:39.596
You just
can't turn it off, can you?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.014
- What?

31:41.015 --> 31:42.431
- This gross invasion of my
privacy.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.201
- Cody, calm down, all right.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.719
Just chill out for a second.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.236
- This is all like a setup,
isn't it?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.172
- You wanted to be a part of
this project.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.475
I am trying to help you.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.644
- Then stop filming me.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.580
- You know, I think you're
just...

31:56.582 --> 31:58.115
You're reacting to the emotional
stress

31:58.117 --> 31:59.216
of yesterday's scene.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.188
- I cannot believe you just said
that.

32:07.693 --> 32:08.625
- What?

32:12.131 --> 32:14.464
- When I read your script it
felt like,

32:14.466 --> 32:17.401
like you were finally
admitting what you did wrong.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.335
- I was.

32:20.940 --> 32:24.241
- I am catching you filming
me, manipulating me.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.276
- What, are you hearing
yourself?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.411
That's crazy.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.219
- I mean, it's written
in the script, isn't it?

32:36.221 --> 32:37.487
- What, what, I don't know
what you're talking ab--

32:37.489 --> 32:39.256
- So stupid, so...

32:41.527 --> 32:42.960
- What the fuck?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.394
- You're the fucking
protagonist!

32:44.396 --> 32:46.496
You're taking this, this very
real thing

32:46.498 --> 32:50.200
that happened to me and
you're taking my real emotions

32:50.202 --> 32:52.336
and you're using it to exploit
me.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.672
To tell your story.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.674
- Hey.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.044
Come here, sit down.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.082
That is...

33:05.084 --> 33:06.583
- You don't even care about me.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.521
- I'm sorry.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.692
That's not true.

33:16.528 --> 33:17.461
I do care.

33:19.598 --> 33:20.764
I...

33:20.766 --> 33:22.199
I thought I was helping.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.336
I'm not good at this.

33:28.607 --> 33:29.673
What can I do?

33:36.515 --> 33:37.447
- Nothing.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.018
I don't know, I don't know.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.487
This doesn't feel right.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.455
Like everything's wrong here.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.324
Like it's like.

33:47.325 --> 33:49.192
It's the woman and it's the
fridge

33:49.194 --> 33:50.794
and the noises at night, you
don't...

33:50.796 --> 33:52.295
You weren't there, you don't--

33:52.297 --> 33:53.463
- Listen.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.998
What is it that you think we
should do?

33:54.999 --> 33:56.532
I mean, what makes you feel
better about all of this.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.957
I hear you--

33:57.958 --> 33:59.380
- Let's just call the cops.

33:59.381 --> 34:00.803
- Cody, I'm not trying to be a
bitch,

34:00.806 --> 34:02.305
but they're gonna laugh in our
face.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.107
I mean, what are we saying to
them?

34:04.109 --> 34:06.343
- I know, but if, but if I...

34:07.179 --> 34:08.210
- Hey, okay.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.646
I have an idea.

34:09.648 --> 34:10.679
We have a full day of filming
today,

34:10.681 --> 34:12.399
but when we're done--

34:12.400 --> 34:14.117
- why don't we go into
town, we'll get some dinner.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.119
We'll relax a little bit.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.337
We'll get out of the house.

34:17.338 --> 34:18.554
I think, I think the isolation
is just

34:18.556 --> 34:21.324
getting to you a little bit,
okay?

34:21.326 --> 34:22.259
- Okay.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.231
- Like all your
problems have melted away.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.533
For the moment, at least.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.737
Good, perfect.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.123
Cut!

34:36.123 --> 34:37.507
Gorgeous, let's do it one more
time.

34:37.509 --> 34:38.742
- A little lower.

34:38.744 --> 34:39.643
- Lower, lower, lower.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.512
- Still don't know you manage to
do this.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.147
- Oh yeah, how's chore prison

34:44.149 --> 34:45.431
over there, Doogster?

34:45.433 --> 34:46.716
- That should be you!

34:46.717 --> 34:49.786
- No, I thought, I...
- Oh, here it comes.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.089
- I don't know, I just thought
when you said the window

34:52.091 --> 34:53.790
doesn't come back up...
- That I was joking.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.858
- I didn't...

34:57.429 --> 34:59.112
- That's hilarious.

34:59.113 --> 35:00.796
- Listen, he saved the day
and you almost ruined it.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.332
When that waitress looked at you
like...

35:02.334 --> 35:03.467
- Oh, yes.

35:03.468 --> 35:04.601
- That was not even my
fault.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.220
She was just crazy.

35:06.221 --> 35:07.838
- Wait, tell the story
again.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.573
- No, no, no, God, please don't.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.274
Don't, do not.
- No.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.676
We can't retell that story.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.111
- Why, I wanna it
for the behind the scenes.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.545
- Honestly, Cody, you had to be
there.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.347
It would be awkward to retell
that story.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.282
- Hey, keep that thing rolling.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.650
Behind the scenes.
- Shit.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.752
Sorry, you missed it kiddo.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.223
- Hey, by the way,

35:26.225 --> 35:27.691
how you feelin'?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.009
- Good.

35:29.010 --> 35:30.326
Town was not as far away as I
thought.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.261
- Yeah.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.296
Told ya.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.466
And, guys, I think I got it.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.436
- Look at that!

35:39.437 --> 35:40.503
- I owe this bastard five bucks.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.372
- Oh my God.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.562
- Morning.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.530
- Morning.

37:13.532 --> 37:14.931
- Oh, the room was very br--

37:17.302 --> 37:18.835
- Everything all right?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.403
- Yeah, the phone's not working.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.504
- What?

37:21.506 --> 37:23.273
- It's probably nothing.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.844
- You trying Morse code.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.847
- Sorry, just, I haven't
talked to my husband

37:30.849 --> 37:31.781
since I got here.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.167
I don't know, it's not fair.

37:34.168 --> 37:35.484
All he's done for me, I just.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.954
I want everything to be okay,
you know?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.889
- It's okay, um.

37:39.891 --> 37:40.824
Yeah, I'll go town.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.342
I'll call him.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.859
And then I'll find someone that
can

37:43.862 --> 37:46.263
fix the phone and bring
him back here, okay?

37:46.265 --> 37:47.297
- Yeah.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.498
Thanks.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.733
- Focus on the movie.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.401
- Yeah.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.602
- You know we could...

37:52.604 --> 37:53.670
We could...

37:54.873 --> 37:58.475
We could do the scene, the
parent scene.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.678
That way Joanna could, she could
help.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.647
- Yeah, that's a good
idea.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.915
- 35,000 feet in the air and
dropping,

38:05.917 --> 38:06.983
there's nothing you can do.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.953
And that makes it far worse.

38:10.856 --> 38:11.905
- My mic keeps falling.

38:11.906 --> 38:12.955
- The car doesn't start.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.624
- Oh, whoa, what do you
mean?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.660
- What the fuck did I
just say?

38:16.662 --> 38:19.429
The car, it does not fucking
start.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.530
- You're okay, we're all
okay.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.565
- I mean, we've got a broken
phone.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.434
We have crazy neighbors.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.302
I mean, how does no one else
see that this is an issue?

38:26.305 --> 38:26.970
- Let's just calm down.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.004
- Fuck you.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.472
Turn it off.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.641
No more fucking cameras.

38:40.552 --> 38:41.951
- Here, drink this.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.386
- We have to do something.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.421
- Cody, I know you're
worried,

38:44.423 --> 38:45.955
but it's probably nothing.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.891
- I don't wanna be stuck here,
Robin.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.592
- We won't be.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.695
- Yeah, the car definitely isn't
working.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.964
- Guys, this is probably a
coincidence,

38:54.966 --> 38:57.334
a random series of events.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.501
Trust me, I don't like that the
car's

38:58.503 --> 38:59.803
not working either, but.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.871
- This is more than just
some stupid phone call

39:01.873 --> 39:04.691
to your fucking husband.

39:04.692 --> 39:07.510
I mean, I feel like, like,
like something bad's happening.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.346
- Could you tell what
was wrong with the car?

39:09.348 --> 39:10.847
- No.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.483
- Well, did someone tamper with
it?

39:13.485 --> 39:14.751
Did someone break something?

39:14.753 --> 39:16.386
- Wait, why would anyone do
that?

39:16.388 --> 39:18.355
- I mean, look, I'm not a huge
car guy,

39:18.357 --> 39:20.457
but all the obvious things are
fine.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.759
- Robin, I'm really freaked out.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.960
- Listen, I'll just walk to
town.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.061
- No, Doug, we need you here.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.896
You're my DP.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.431
Once Cody calms down...

39:28.433 --> 39:29.933
- I'm not gonna calm
down.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.434
- Look, okay, I get it,
I see your point of view.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.569
Listen, that's why I gotta go.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.037
You need your actors here.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.504
Cody's in no shape to go
anywhere.

39:35.505 --> 39:36.971
Let's be honest, you can still
shoot something without me.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.974
- I wanna go to town.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.843
- Well, then fucking go, okay!

39:39.845 --> 39:41.745
- Don't talk to her that
way.

39:42.681 --> 39:46.116
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

39:46.118 --> 39:47.817
We're just so far behind.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.421
I feel like this is my one
chance and I'm blowing it.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.155
- Oh, you mean I'm
blowing it.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.089
- No, God.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.624
Cody, I don't--
- Come on.

39:58.063 --> 39:58.995
Look.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.435
Robin, I know that you think
that Cody's overreacting here.

40:05.437 --> 40:06.970
I mean, but not having a car or
a phone.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.138
I mean, what if there's an
accident?

40:08.140 --> 40:09.639
- Yeah, I know, but I need you
here.

40:09.641 --> 40:10.507
- Listen, you have the shot
list.

40:10.509 --> 40:11.174
You'll be fine.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.012
Robin, Cody is scared!

40:16.013 --> 40:17.479
And when we were kids I saw
her scared and I did nothing.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.983
And I won't let that happen
again.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.586
Look, it should take me
about an hour and a half

40:23.588 --> 40:24.988
to get to town and I don't know
how long

40:24.990 --> 40:26.890
to find a tow truck after that.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.805
Look, everything's gonna be all
right.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.513
Town's not that far, remember?

40:50.515 --> 40:51.448
- Yeah.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.017
- Come here.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.113
- I know that you're kicking off
customers

41:24.115 --> 41:26.883
for fucking employees.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.485
No, listen to me, asshole!

41:28.487 --> 41:29.953
I need to get on that fucking
plane

41:29.955 --> 41:32.655
because my parents are fucking
dead!

41:32.657 --> 41:34.524
No, don't you fucking dare.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.626
I'm gonna get on that fucking
plane, you understand me?

41:36.628 --> 41:38.995
I need to be there, I
need to fucking be there!

41:40.232 --> 41:41.164
Fuck you!

41:45.237 --> 41:46.536
Mother fucker!

41:54.946 --> 41:56.513
Okay, what the fuck?

41:59.017 --> 41:59.949
- A rock.

42:01.586 --> 42:02.519
- What is it?

42:09.094 --> 42:11.694
"Give them pleasure, the
same pleasure they have

42:11.696 --> 42:14.797
"when waking up from a
nightmare?"

42:14.799 --> 42:16.032
Alfred Hitchcock.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.004
- Was this you?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.841
- What?

42:24.843 --> 42:26.175
- Is this you, are you doing
this?

42:26.177 --> 42:28.244
Are you fucking with me?

42:30.649 --> 42:32.282
- No, I would never.

42:32.284 --> 42:34.617
- You're taking advantage.

42:34.619 --> 42:38.121
This is all for some fucking
documentary about me, isn't it?

42:38.990 --> 42:40.723
- Cody, there are no cameras
running.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.091
- You want me to act out.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.560
You want me to freak out.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.194
It's her, it's her, it's you!

42:45.196 --> 42:47.130
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls,
girls, girls.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.801
Let's just go sit down, okay?

42:53.287 --> 42:54.770
♪ Look who's here, look who's
here ♪

42:54.773 --> 42:56.873
♪ There's a boy I'm mad about ♪

42:56.875 --> 42:58.808
♪ Oh my dear, when he's near ♪

42:58.810 --> 43:01.978
♪ So big and strong, so full of
youth ♪

43:01.980 --> 43:06.783
♪ Oh Momma, oh Poppa, tell me
the truth ♪

43:09.154 --> 43:10.119
- Hey.

43:10.989 --> 43:11.854
You need a ride?

43:11.856 --> 43:12.855
- You headed to town?

43:15.727 --> 43:16.810
If you don't mind.

43:16.811 --> 43:17.894
- Doogie, get in.

43:17.896 --> 43:18.928
- How do you know my...

43:22.968 --> 43:24.801
- We don't know that, Joanna.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.235
We just don't know how long it
takes

43:26.237 --> 43:27.270
to walk to town, all right?

43:27.272 --> 43:28.171
- Cody's right!

43:28.173 --> 43:30.139
Someone is fucking with us.

43:34.079 --> 43:36.245
- We should go find a neighbor.

43:36.247 --> 43:39.916
- Robin, we have to assume
that Doug already tried that.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.217
If he'd seen anyone home.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.785
- Why wouldn't anyone be home?

43:42.787 --> 43:44.988
- He was handing out the gift
baskets

43:44.990 --> 43:46.055
and that's what he said, right?

43:46.057 --> 43:48.257
- We should at least try.

43:48.259 --> 43:51.928
I mean, he only hit the houses
out front on the main road.

43:51.930 --> 43:54.097
There are a lot more back in the
woods

43:54.098 --> 43:56.265
that we didn't drive by and
he probably didn't get to.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.969
- Robin, we're losing it here.

44:01.039 --> 44:04.307
I just think it's a foolish idea

44:04.309 --> 44:07.243
to go wandering through
the woods at night.

44:07.245 --> 44:12.281
- Listen to me, Cody has
been trying to warn us, me,

44:12.917 --> 44:17.887
about all this and I've
been too focused on my movie

44:19.057 --> 44:20.156
to listen to her.

44:23.695 --> 44:27.363
She's not crazy for being
as scared as she is.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.834
We're crazy for not listening to
her.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.002
- We're all crazy.

44:33.938 --> 44:35.905
Damn it, all right, I'll go.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.857
- Thank you.
- We should all go.

44:37.858 --> 44:39.808
- No, no, no, no, you should
honestly stay here with Cody.

44:39.811 --> 44:42.078
- You can't just leave three
girls alone.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.146
- Yes, I can.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.247
- Fine.

44:44.248 --> 44:45.347
Cause we're women we
can't handle ourselves?

44:45.350 --> 44:47.233
- Right.

44:47.234 --> 44:49.117
- Look, I'm just as
feminist as the next girl.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.387
Someone threw a fucking
rock through the window.

44:51.389 --> 44:53.790
I'm legitimately creeped out.

44:53.792 --> 44:54.724
Yeah, we should.

44:55.427 --> 44:56.859
Yeah, we should stay together.

44:56.861 --> 44:59.796
- Robin, you will be together.

44:59.798 --> 45:00.797
I'll be fine.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.199
Okay?

45:03.201 --> 45:04.133
I promise.

45:05.737 --> 45:07.236
- Yeah, okay.

45:08.373 --> 45:09.939
- You ready?

45:09.941 --> 45:11.207
Lock the doors after me.

45:17.716 --> 45:18.448
Hey.

45:19.784 --> 45:21.784
I'll be right back, all right?

45:22.987 --> 45:24.987
And just so you know that it's
me

45:24.989 --> 45:27.290
I'm gonna ring the doorbell once

45:27.292 --> 45:29.258
and then two quick times, okay?

45:29.260 --> 45:31.861
Like ding, ding ding.
- Okay.

45:31.863 --> 45:33.163
Yeah.
- Okay?

45:33.164 --> 45:34.464
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

45:34.465 --> 45:35.765
- And if you hear any other type
of ring,

45:36.367 --> 45:38.835
you don't even come to the door.

45:38.837 --> 45:39.769
- Wait.

45:40.772 --> 45:42.238
- Are you gonna try next door?

45:43.842 --> 45:45.775
- She was fucking weird, right?

45:45.777 --> 45:46.509
And...

45:46.511 --> 45:49.378
The chopping outside, it's not
normal.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.180
- I know, I just...

45:51.182 --> 45:53.049
- I'll save it for last.

45:53.985 --> 45:55.818
- Okay, just come back soon.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.121
- I will, I'll be right back,
all right?

45:58.123 --> 45:59.055
All right.

46:23.148 --> 46:24.547
- Where are they?

46:27.252 --> 46:29.085
We're just fucking sitting here!

46:29.087 --> 46:30.153
- Stop, Cody!
- It's stupid!

46:30.155 --> 46:31.420
- I can't.

46:31.422 --> 46:34.223
Please just stop, you're making
it worse.

46:34.225 --> 46:36.259
- I'm making it worse?

46:36.261 --> 46:37.193
I'm...

46:38.429 --> 46:40.530
Fuck this, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

46:44.803 --> 46:46.836
- Is that the phone?

46:46.838 --> 46:47.570
- The phone works.

46:47.572 --> 46:48.905
The phone works!

46:50.741 --> 46:52.574
- Answer it, go answer it, go
answer it!

46:52.577 --> 46:54.277
- Hello?

46:54.279 --> 46:55.978
Oh my God, it's Doug!

46:55.980 --> 46:57.547
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:57.549 --> 46:59.366
Hi.

46:59.367 --> 47:01.184
He has a tow truck and
he's five minutes away.

47:02.887 --> 47:05.188
- Okay.
- What took you so long?

47:05.190 --> 47:06.522
He did get lost.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.158
Yeah.

47:10.862 --> 47:13.129
Well, we're gonna stay here, of
course.

47:14.299 --> 47:15.965
I love you, Doogie.

47:15.967 --> 47:17.533
See you soon.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.302
- Thank fucking, God.

47:19.304 --> 47:20.369
Thank fuckin' Doogie!

47:20.371 --> 47:21.537
- Yeah.
- Doogie.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.844
- Okay, we have a phone that
works.

47:28.513 --> 47:29.445
Um.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.697
Who do we call?

47:30.698 --> 47:31.948
- Oh, I should call my
husband.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.650
Tell him I'm okay.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.351
- No, I meant like, like
the cops.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.753
- Yeah
- Why?

47:36.754 --> 47:38.154
I mean, Doug said he was coming,
right?

47:38.156 --> 47:40.890
- Well, yeah, but, Robin,
someone threw a rock

47:40.892 --> 47:42.559
through our window.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.227
I mean, that's not--
- Okay, okay, sure, but just.

47:44.229 --> 47:46.028
I'll call Max really fast.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.864
Who knows how long that
phone call could take.

47:47.866 --> 47:50.132
I'll just tell him I'm okay and
then

47:50.134 --> 47:51.000
call the cops right after.

47:51.002 --> 47:52.101
I promise.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.035
I'll be fast.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.438
- Fine.

48:03.948 --> 48:04.881
- Hey, babe.

48:06.551 --> 48:07.583
Oh my God, no wait, guys.

48:07.585 --> 48:08.885
He's on his way here.

48:08.887 --> 48:11.220
- Really?
- Yeah, to surprise me.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.989
Wow, that's so fantastic.

48:15.159 --> 48:17.426
No, the shoot's been good,
there's just

48:17.428 --> 48:19.462
some weird stuff has happened.

48:19.464 --> 48:20.997
Hey, do you mind?

48:23.067 --> 48:24.550
No, we're fine.

48:24.551 --> 48:26.034
I mean, we're gonna call
the cops in a second.

48:32.644 --> 48:33.609
- I think I'm gonna take a
shower.

48:33.611 --> 48:36.445
kinda calm down a little bit.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.147
Do you need anything?

48:38.149 --> 48:39.482
- I'm all right.

48:41.119 --> 48:45.554
- Cody, I think if someone
were trying to, I don't know,

48:46.391 --> 48:49.525
do whatever, then why would the
phone

48:49.527 --> 48:50.593
start ringing again?

48:52.163 --> 48:53.663
I'm with you, that rock was
scary,

48:53.665 --> 48:55.431
but if someone's trying to fuck
with us

48:55.433 --> 48:56.699
that's just what they're doing.

48:56.700 --> 48:57.966
They're just fucking with us.

48:58.670 --> 49:00.002
- You're right.

49:00.004 --> 49:00.670
- It's gonna be okay.

49:16.187 --> 49:17.219
- You home?

49:21.292 --> 49:22.224
Hello?

49:44.449 --> 49:45.414
Hello?

49:47.085 --> 49:48.684
Guys, anyone home?

49:48.686 --> 49:50.486
We just need help.

49:50.488 --> 49:51.687
Our car is broken down.

50:31.562 --> 50:32.628
- Yeah, I know.

50:33.498 --> 50:35.731
It's been an interesting week.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.686
- Help.

50:57.688 --> 50:59.088
- Doug.

50:59.090 --> 51:01.290
- Help.

51:01.292 --> 51:02.558
- Doug.

51:02.559 --> 51:03.825
- Make it stop.

51:03.828 --> 51:06.078
- Where are you, man?

51:06.079 --> 51:08.329
- I'm hurt,
please.

51:08.332 --> 51:10.366
- What are you doing out there?

51:10.368 --> 51:12.301
I was worried about you, man.

51:12.303 --> 51:15.238
What the--

51:33.825 --> 51:36.225
Please.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.426
Please, don't kill me.

51:38.396 --> 51:39.328
Please.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.098
- Are you scared?

51:42.100 --> 51:42.832
- Yes.

51:44.302 --> 51:45.367
Yes.

51:45.369 --> 51:46.735
- I envy you.

51:55.413 --> 51:56.345
Leave it.

51:58.716 --> 52:00.316
Go on, get the bucket.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.831
You understand what I'm
trying to do, right?

52:17.301 --> 52:18.701
- Yes, of course.

52:22.206 --> 52:23.606
- Good.

52:26.777 --> 52:28.611
I know you have a different
vision

52:30.815 --> 52:32.448
for how this would pan out.

52:35.520 --> 52:39.321
I did this for all of us.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.326
Give me your eyes.

52:45.730 --> 52:47.263
Because we're a family.

52:50.368 --> 52:51.300
- Yes.

52:51.302 --> 52:54.737
There's no one in the world I
trust more.

52:54.739 --> 52:55.871
- Gold star.

52:59.177 --> 52:59.909
Faith.

53:00.912 --> 53:03.612
It's an important quality to
have.

53:03.614 --> 53:06.348
It's something I admire about
you.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.294
Mm.

53:18.296 --> 53:19.728
Don't forget the pinky toe.

53:23.467 --> 53:24.500
Oh.

53:31.775 --> 53:34.209
- It's just been
problem after problem.

53:34.212 --> 53:35.311
I'm glad your coming.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.313
I'm excited to see you too.

53:38.216 --> 53:39.481
- How did Doug know our
number?

53:39.483 --> 53:41.250
- Oh, just one second.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.751
- When I was talking to him on
the phone

53:42.753 --> 53:43.686
he seemed different.

53:43.688 --> 53:44.753
He seemed odd.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.526
He didn't correct me.

53:50.528 --> 53:51.927
- Didn't correct what?

53:51.929 --> 53:54.663
- I called him Dougie
and he didn't correct me.

53:56.901 --> 53:58.767
- Um, sorry, babe.

53:58.769 --> 54:00.636
We need to call the police.

54:00.638 --> 54:02.771
I'll call you back right after,
I promise.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.631
- No!

55:02.633 --> 55:03.632
No!

55:03.634 --> 55:06.535
No!

55:07.371 --> 55:08.304
- Hello?

55:09.307 --> 55:10.806
Max, are you there?

55:10.808 --> 55:12.775
It's dead again.

55:12.777 --> 55:13.642
Max?

55:28.326 --> 55:29.758
Max, oh fuck!

55:29.760 --> 55:31.026
- How does that happen?

55:31.028 --> 55:32.661
- Where's Joanna?

55:32.663 --> 55:34.463
- She's upstairs taking a
shower.

55:37.868 --> 55:38.801
- Oh God.

55:40.971 --> 55:43.372
Joanna, are you in there?

55:46.077 --> 55:46.942
Joanna?

55:48.879 --> 55:50.746
You said she was in the shower?

55:50.747 --> 55:52.614
- I know, but I don't
hear the water running.

55:54.885 --> 55:55.818
- Oh, thank God.

55:55.820 --> 55:56.985
- What?
- It's Aaron.

55:56.987 --> 55:58.420
- No, it could be anyone.

55:58.421 --> 55:59.854
- He did our secret ring, it's
him.

56:00.758 --> 56:01.924
- Girl Scout cookies.

56:03.493 --> 56:05.059
- Oh my God, run, run!
- Don't be scared.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.879
- Oh God, no, no, no, no
no!

56:06.880 --> 56:08.697
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

56:10.534 --> 56:11.734
Oh my God, no!

56:26.917 --> 56:27.850
No!

56:30.988 --> 56:31.920
Oh no!

56:34.592 --> 56:35.457
- We have to get up.

56:35.459 --> 56:36.492
We have to get up.

56:36.494 --> 56:37.159
Cody, you have to get up.

56:37.161 --> 56:38.427
We gotta get up.

56:38.429 --> 56:39.428
We gotta go.

56:39.430 --> 56:41.029
- Oh, there you are, Peter.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.113
- Where, where?

57:02.553 --> 57:03.852
Come here, come here.

57:03.854 --> 57:05.988
Okay, okay.

57:05.990 --> 57:08.557
Get down, get down.
- No!

57:12.430 --> 57:14.496
- Please, please, don't leave
me.

57:19.036 --> 57:20.436
She's...

57:20.438 --> 57:21.170
She's right...

57:28.445 --> 57:30.112
- Look in my eyes, she can't get
in.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.166
- Scooch.

57:53.637 --> 57:57.005
Girls, Robin, Cody?

57:57.007 --> 57:59.007
- I don't wanna die.

57:59.008 --> 58:01.008
- I just wanna tell
you a story.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.546
It's about Paul Bunyan!

58:06.150 --> 58:08.116
Fuck, this is harder than I
thought.

58:08.118 --> 58:09.935
- No, no, no, no,

58:09.936 --> 58:11.753
Please, please!
The lumberjack extraordinaire!

58:11.755 --> 58:12.754
- You can not!

58:15.993 --> 58:19.895
No.
- Fee, fie, foe, fum!

58:20.764 --> 58:24.867
I smell the blood of two
bitches!

58:25.636 --> 58:27.736
- You were always braver
than me.

58:27.737 --> 58:29.837
- Your tears bring me
pleasure.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.006
- I'm so sorry.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.742
- I'm gonna murder
you.

58:33.744 --> 58:34.743
- Come on.

58:35.746 --> 58:37.880
We're gonna rush him.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.715
Come on, come on, we're gonna...

58:41.252 --> 58:42.918
Who could that be?

58:45.890 --> 58:46.788
Come on.

58:46.790 --> 58:47.656
Come on.

58:47.658 --> 58:48.590
- Robin?

59:00.571 --> 59:01.303
Robin?

59:02.606 --> 59:04.172
Robin, you here?

59:04.174 --> 59:05.240
- Max!

59:05.242 --> 59:06.942
- Where are you guys?
- Max, run!

59:06.944 --> 59:08.777
Max, just fucking run!

59:08.779 --> 59:09.812
- What happened to this door?

59:09.813 --> 59:10.846
What kind of movie are you guys
shooting?

59:13.884 --> 59:16.218
What's going on, you okay?

59:16.220 --> 59:17.152
Holy shit!

59:18.289 --> 59:19.221
- Who the fuck are them?

59:19.223 --> 59:20.088
Did you see them?

59:20.090 --> 59:21.573
Did you see the people?

59:21.574 --> 59:23.057
There's these people and
they've been trying to hurt us.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.860
- Okay, okay, you okay?

59:24.862 --> 59:26.261
I see you, okay?

59:26.263 --> 59:27.729
- We have to go, we have to go.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.565
We have to go right now,
we have to go right now.

59:29.567 --> 59:30.232
Cody, let's go.

59:30.234 --> 59:32.000
Cody, let's go!

59:32.002 --> 59:34.002
Come, come on, come on.
- No.

59:34.004 --> 59:34.970
- Yes, yes, we're going.

59:34.972 --> 59:36.655
- No, no.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.339
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

59:38.342 --> 59:39.808
No!

59:39.810 --> 59:42.844
Wait, no, no, no, stop!

59:42.846 --> 59:43.712
- We have to go.

59:43.714 --> 59:44.880
- Stop!

59:44.881 --> 59:46.047
It's like they're one step ahead
of us!

59:46.050 --> 59:47.182
You know it.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.150
They knew.

59:48.152 --> 59:49.618
- Let's go.

59:49.619 --> 59:51.085
- They orchestrated everything.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.554
It's like they knew.

59:52.555 --> 59:54.021
- It's okay.
- What's she talking about?

59:54.024 --> 59:56.024
- They knew.
- I don't know.

59:56.026 --> 59:57.092
- They knew.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.365
- Cody.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:04.299
- Look.

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.670
- I don't see anything.

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:10.339
- They're filming us.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.710
- Those sick fucks, why?

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:20.649
- Oh, he's back.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.084
- What?

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.085
- He's back for us.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:23.919
- Cody, who's back?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:24.786
What is it?

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.021
What is it?

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:27.322
- Ha, Binny it's him.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.257
- Who?
- He came back for us.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.893
It's Dad, he's back.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.029
He knew, he knows that we're
friends

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:36.765
and he can't handle it, and
he's gonna come back for me.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:37.699
- Cody, stop!

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:38.967
- He's always been back for me.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.335
And he could never leave me.
- Shut up!

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.871
You need to pull yourself
together, okay?

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:44.740
'Cause we're gonna get outta
this.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.141
We're gonna get outta this.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.676
- No, we're not.

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:51.780
We're never getting outta this.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:54.116
- Okay, okay, if they're filming
us

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:55.851
then they're listening to us.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.286
So.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:00:59.538
What do we do?

01:00:59.539 --> 01:01:00.789
- We do something unexpected.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:02.090
Come on, come on, over here,
come on.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:03.025
Let's go!

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.096
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.851
- Robin, wait, wait!

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.021
- Gah, fuck, ah, get it
off!

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.856
Get it off!
- Hold still, I'm trying!

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.393
- Can you walk?

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:39.261
Take the camera.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:40.852
- Okay.

01:01:40.853 --> 01:01:42.442
- And I'll help, I'll
help Max.

01:01:42.443 --> 01:01:44.032
Okay, come on, come
on, you have to get up.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.370
- All right, all right,
okay.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:51.640
- I'm gonna turn
the camera off, okay?

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.374
- No, no, no, no, no, there
could be more of those things!

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:55.108
- Okay, we'll,
just cover the light

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.778
and we'll use it sparingly,
okay?

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.713
Here.

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:00.282
It wastes battery to turn it off
and on.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:01.216
- Okay.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.510
Okay, all right.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:30.811
I just need to, I need to
wrap my head around this one.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:32.748
What exactly happened--

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.149
- I don't know they--

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.016
- They what?

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:36.084
- They showed up.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.151
- They showed up doing
what?

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.987
Why didn't you call the cops?

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.422
- We tried, but they
turned

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.856
our fucking phones off, Max.

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:44.159
- There's just a lot of
things you could've done here

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:47.329
and I'm just not sure you did
everything.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:49.164
I just need some answers!

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.316
- It's not really the
time, okay?

01:02:51.317 --> 01:02:53.467
- Okay, no, but I need
to know what's going on, okay?

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.837
No more secrets, no more
excuses!

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:56.905
- He'll hear us.

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:57.972
- Who is going to hear us?

01:02:57.975 --> 01:02:59.775
Your dead father?

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.476
Why would she say that, Robin?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.345
What does that have to do
with...

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:04.479
With any of this?

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.082
- You didn't tell him.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:08.950
- Tell me what?

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.256
- Cody.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:15.223
- What was that?

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:16.825
What was that script?

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:20.262
- Cody, it's, it's, it's how I
feel.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:23.031
It just might, not have happened
that way.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:24.399
- And so that's
what that moment was.

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:25.968
Just script fodder.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:27.536
Something to make your
character more complicated!

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.837
- Cody, please.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.173
- You are disgusting.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.943
- Don't use that word.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:39.080
Cody, run!

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.582
- Oh, fuck!

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:55.096
- Slow it down.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.833
- Oh, faster, faster, faster.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.578
The sun's coming up soon so.

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.881
God knows how long I've been out
here.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.918
I just wanted to say something
to...

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.223
You.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:25.927
People are gonna know what
happened here.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:31.466
You thought you planned it so
perfectly,

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:33.969
but you made a mistake.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.404
You left an opening for me.

01:05:22.101 --> 01:05:23.150
- Happy New
Year!

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.420
I'm just so blooming excited.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:28.390
- Ah, the day, I
fell in love with directing.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:29.975
- I'm not sure that it's
working.

01:05:29.976 --> 01:05:31.559
- Mm-hmm, it must
be in the movie, I love it.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.361
- Yeah, it's confusing.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:34.963
I just...

01:05:34.965 --> 01:05:38.366
I just feel like the
audience's expectations

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:39.634
are that this will come back
later.

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:42.337
It isn't clear that it's
your first experience

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:44.139
with a camera.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.940
And you can't lose your
audience at the beginning

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.309
then you're fucked.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:50.712
- Remember your push back
with the cheetah footage.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.213
Work with me on this.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:54.015
I don't wanna have another
fight.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:56.685
- Yeah.

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:01.256
- Is this hard?

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.190
- To edit?

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:03.725
- No.

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:06.361
To watch your friends die?

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.103
Robin.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.005
- Yes.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:21.676
- I asked is it hard
to watch your friends die?

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.714
- Uh, no, not any more.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.149
I've gotten numb to it.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:32.287
Also, I'm, I'm excited.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.590
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:36.458
- I couldn't tell.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.310
- No, I am.

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:40.161
I think it's gonna be very good.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.597
Excellent.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:43.531
A work of art.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:46.735
- I'll buy that for a
dollar.

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:51.172
- Should I make dinner soon?

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:52.407
- That would be
wonderful.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.341
- Okay.

01:06:56.613 --> 01:07:00.148
- I love the exposed wood in the
ceilings.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.583
There's a stray bulb on set.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.553
Can you remove it for picture?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.594
I think we're ready.

01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:23.371
I love the symmetry of
your composition, Doogie.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.542
Very well done today.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:29.778
You've earned this.

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:32.414
Be a free man now.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:35.350
First marks, Doogie.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.266
- Can I say something
to them first, please?

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:55.303
- That would depend
on what you're going to say?

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.138
- Just good things.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.173
Only good things.

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:01.142
- Fine.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:05.713
- Robin.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.083
Do everything they say--

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:09.384
- That's enough!

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:20.428
Little to your right.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.270
A little smidge back to your
left.

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:33.140
Perfect.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.859
If you please.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.572
- We're all crazy.

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:12.881
- Help, someone!

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:14.349
- That's not gonna
help.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:27.495
- Show me your face, you fucking
coward.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.566
- Funny coming from you.

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.211
I'll show you right now.

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:58.860
- Who are you?

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.531
- I think you can do a better
question?

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:07.669
- Why...

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:10.738
Why, why are you doing this to
us?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.308
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, we have a winner!

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.542
Here's your answer.

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:24.819
To whom it may concern,

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:32.260
I know pain, I've watched
it, I studied it, lived it.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.531
I grew up around it in our
house.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:39.500
A thick cloud of agony
cuddled in the corner

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:45.006
of every room.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.540
A stark reminder of our
transgressions.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.110
- Please, please, please don't.

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.677
Please.
- One minute a person screams

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.848
to cope with it, the
next, they laugh to rob it

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.550
of it's power.

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:59.988
Some, wear their pain
like a badge of honor.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:04.359
Others tuck it away,
hoping no one will ever see

01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:08.263
how weak they really are,
but they can't escape it.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:13.768
Pain is as authentic to the
human experience as love.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.838
I see it in my husband
struggling to connect with me.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.740
Pardon me, Doug.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:22.610
Every conversation slyly
circling the same question

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.780
over and over again.

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:28.683
Why don't I understand you?

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:31.786
Not knowing that if he ever
actually asked that question

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.290
he'd break the unspoken promise
we've kept all these years.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.792
A promise, he'll never ask.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.594
There are only two constant
truths

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:42.330
that I've been able to parse out

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:44.932
through all my observations of
pain.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:47.835
This is the part that
really I identified with.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.505
Cody, you know where I'm going.

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:52.040
You read it, right?

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:53.441
This is why I chose you.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.812
First, you can't get past it
without

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.514
looking it dead in the eye.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:02.350
Those hard questions need to be
asked.

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:05.086
Those hard answers need to be
faced.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:09.524
I know this because I've seen my
sister

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:12.560
ignore the pain she's
held her entire life.

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:17.398
Through seeing her own struggle

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:22.337
I've also realized I've done the
same.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:29.644
Mm, mm, mm, I think you'll
like this part, Cody.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:36.751
I faulted and failed in
many parts of my life.

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:41.389
I've been selfish, negligent,
uncaring.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:46.561
I'm not the person I dreamt
I would become as a child.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:48.863
Da, da, da, da, da.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.866
Repeating myself over and
over, "you'll be brave,

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.569
"you'll be smart, you'll be
honest,"

01:12:55.472 --> 01:13:00.541
but today is the first day I
start keeping that promise.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.680
My sister deserves a better
sister.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.415
She's been brave.

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.916
She's been smart.

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:14.655
But she hasn't been honest,
not with what happened,

01:13:14.657 --> 01:13:18.159
which is why I need this
opportunity

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:20.995
to film in your beautiful home.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:24.866
To show my sister and
the world an awful...

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:27.068
but honest truth.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:31.572
An axiom once seen will
dispense...

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.074
the second constant

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.711
I've known all these years,

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:44.619
pain...

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:50.792
can be beautiful.

01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:54.495
Sincerely,

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:57.064
Robin.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.503
Gets me every time.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:08.009
- I...

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:10.077
I don't know.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.181
Why?

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:14.115
Why?

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.487
- It's okay.
- Please.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:29.730
- Smile.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:32.667
- What?

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.136
- Smile.

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.505
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.493
- Please.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.863
Please, don't, don't kill us.

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:02.697
Please.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:03.631
- Kill you?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:05.500
What?

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:07.034
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.203
Don't think that, you poor
thing.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.507
Give me your eyes.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.910
We don't wanna kill you.

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:17.645
You have everything we need.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:19.847
It's all in the essay.

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:31.158
There you go.

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:33.160
Beautiful.

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.298
Now, we'll collaborate.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.735
Show the world how beautiful
pain can be.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:44.939
So smile.

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:53.214
Smile.

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.894

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:42.263
Robin finished her first cut of
the film.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.366
- Can't I just watch one more
episode?

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:46.267
- Uh uh.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.234
Up!

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:48.169
Up!

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:15.830
- Cody.

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:16.764
- Hey.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.099
- How are you?

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.066
How's everything?

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.269
Your hair is getting really
long.

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:25.906
What's wrong with her?
- That's enough.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.677
It's how she's coping.

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.383
Dinner, it smells wonderful.

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.954
Oh, I watched the first cut.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:44.225
I was noticing, it actually
seems like your husband

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.027
was behind it all.

01:17:46.029 --> 01:17:47.028
- Did it?

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:48.329
Oh, I'll fix that.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:50.297
- No, I quite like it.

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:53.034
Maybe in the next version
you could lean into that.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:57.171
Especially when, Cody
thinks her father's back.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:17:59.340
- Yeah.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.748
- It might
add a touch of mystery.

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:10.117
Could be nice to play with the
trope

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.420
of who's behind the mask?

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:15.122
Challenge the audience's
expectations a little bit.

01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:17.391
- Won't it be disappointing to
find out

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:18.993
it isn't anybody we know?

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:24.331
- Actually, quite the
opposite.

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.901
I think it's a little poetic.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.037
Considering everything that
you and Cody went through

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.038
with your father.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.310
Someone you thought you knew
turned out to be a stranger.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.446
No, this is good.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:40.448
Audiences like metaphors.

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:44.819
- Yeah, I think that might be
really nice.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.156
- It's really
coming along, Robin.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.257
The film looks great.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.029
You're so close to executing my
vision.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:05.106
You know what would be really
nice?

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:07.141
If we got a family shot.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:10.511
Since we're so rarely in
the same room together.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:13.981
You smell nice.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.017
How you doing, kiddo?

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.123

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.192
Ah.

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:32.500
Well.
