Pink Panthers for my freedom.
It has to be ironclad.

00:13.972 --> 00:14.973
You deserve to.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.892
They promised you freedom before,

00:16.975 --> 00:18.727
what makes you think
this time they'll deliver?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.312
Who says that's all I'm after?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.439
PETER: Panthers are going after the Fed.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.649
How much cash are we talking?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.359
$500 million.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.653
All that cash, through tubes?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.696
NEAL:
These tubes are linked to the airport.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.657
They carry the cash so we won't have to.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.410
We walk right out and straight to
where the money is waiting for us, here.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.621
This is all going down now.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.164
You said you had a bigger plan.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.916
Where the hell do I fit in?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.543
Let me make this clear.

00:42.626 --> 00:46.421
I am not going to raise our child
as a married single mother.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.007
And he's going to be
the first priority in this family.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.509
We have a problem to solve.

00:50.676 --> 00:51.969
'Cause now we're a man short.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.637
I assume you have a solution.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.055
I do.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.396
Now who the hell are you?

01:10.946 --> 01:14.658
Woodford, we need another man.
He's the best I know.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.577
We can do the job without him.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.370
NEAL: No, we can't.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.539
Look, if you trust me, trust him.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.709
Why should I?

01:24.209 --> 01:27.880
Because I pulled the Graff
diamond heist in London in '07.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.798
Sloane Street.

01:30.048 --> 01:34.219
Modeled it after the same Graff
diamond heist you pulled in '03.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.598
You either shoot him
or let's get on with our day.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.771
The '07 job was some of
the best work I've ever seen.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.107
Brilliantly planned.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.609
You're making me blush.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.406
Remind me, what was it
you drove for the getaway?

01:56.742 --> 01:59.077
A Bentley Continental Flying Spur.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.414
But that's a trick question,
I wasn't driving.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.082
We had a chauffeur.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.097
Nice work, Mr. Dunbar.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.058
Learned from the best.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.107
The Suit?

02:29.525 --> 02:32.444
I can't believe you gave my spot
in the Panthers to the Suit!

02:32.945 --> 02:34.238
Calm down, Moz.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.322
I am calm.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.407
No, you're not. That's a Zinfandel.

Well, I am drinking

Hey, Caffrey.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.961
You sure we want cue ball on this?

02:49.044 --> 02:51.755
Neal, please explain to me what's going on
before I have an aneurism.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.298
Sit down, I'll explain.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.926
Said Brutus to Caesar. No, I'll stand.

How do I know this little weasel
is not gonna steal my cash and run?

03:00.138 --> 03:01.181
What cash?

03:01.598 --> 03:05.727
Steal 30 million from the Pink Panthers
with no one the wiser.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.814
If you shut that hole in your face
for two seconds,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.732
you might learn something. Come on.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.735
NEAL: Kept you on the outside
for a reason, Moz.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.447
It's exactly where I need you.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.366

will never see it coming.

The FBI won't be looking for you,
and even if they were,

03:26.498 --> 03:28.417
you'll be somewhere else entirely.

Tapping into the pneumatic tubes
from a separate location.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.260
I'll need to find
the best collection point,

to the old post office.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.767
Wait. Wait.

Didn't you say,

03:46.935 --> 03:51.231
if you screw over the Panthers
they go after everyone you care about.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.900
The Panthers won't know it was us.

See you bright and breezy, Caffrey.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.657
You're worried.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.900
And for the longest time

39:18.066 --> 39:21.486
I thought he knew.

39:22.738 --> 39:27.993
He knew he was gonna die,
so he gave me this to say goodbye.

39:29.328 --> 39:31.205

39:32.414 --> 39:34.541
it must have been a con.
