[Virginia] <i> Previously on</i>
<i>Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:14.583 --> 00:16.082
You admitted to deceiving
two people.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.717
Me, in pretending to be
someone else,

00:17.753 --> 00:19.319
and your lover's wife.

00:19.354 --> 00:22.055
I never saw myself as a threat
to the man's wife.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.323
Because?

00:23.358 --> 00:25.425
Because I never wanted
to marry him.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.261
Libby, we can't do this anymore.
This has to be over.

00:28.297 --> 00:30.597
Because you envisioned a future
with Virginia?

00:30.632 --> 00:33.266
Virginia, I love you.
I always have.

00:33.302 --> 00:35.202
I'm leaving.

00:35.237 --> 00:38.171
Are you afraid he's coming?
Or are you afraid he's not?

00:38.207 --> 00:40.207
[tires screeching]

00:40.242 --> 00:41.708
I'm taking your license
for three months.

00:41.743 --> 00:44.110
You'll also complete
a mandatory AA program.

00:44.146 --> 00:47.681
Like all things in life, you get
out of AA what you put in.

00:47.716 --> 00:49.883
Well, if you're an alcoholic,
perhaps that's true.

00:49.918 --> 00:52.118
Your dad, he's gonna stay
somewhere else for a while.

00:52.154 --> 00:53.687
So you're getting divorced?

00:53.722 --> 00:58.191
I have done my job, your job,
and Virginia's job.

00:58.227 --> 00:59.459
I love you as much
as I always did.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.294
You just don't want
to sleep with me.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.697
Maybe you can just tell me
what's-- what's going on.

01:03.732 --> 01:06.967
[exhales sharply]
Shoes.

01:07.002 --> 01:10.270
A monthly column in "Playboy"
about sex?

01:10.305 --> 01:11.871
I will only publish
your column

01:11.907 --> 01:14.274
if you'll remain
the Masters and Johnson team.

01:14.309 --> 01:16.042
We have to hire new people.

01:16.078 --> 01:17.744
New partners.

01:17.779 --> 01:20.814
For both of us.

To coin a phrase.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.061
[indistinct chatter]

02:55.877 --> 02:57.043
Come to bed, Bill.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.881
All you have to do is crawl
back in.

03:05.554 --> 03:06.720
[John] You sleep here?

03:09.758 --> 03:12.492
What-- what are you
doing here, John?

03:12.527 --> 03:14.561
You get to work early,
so I figured you'd be here,

03:14.596 --> 03:16.930
but I thought you lived
in a hotel.

03:16.965 --> 03:20.767
Uh, I was paying $5 a night
for a...

03:20.802 --> 03:24.003
...a bed when I have
a perfectly good one here.

03:24.039 --> 03:25.572
What, uh, shouldn't you be
at school?

03:25.607 --> 03:27.073
It doesn't start
until 8:00.

03:27.109 --> 03:29.843
[exhales sharply]

03:29.878 --> 03:31.878
Uh, does your mother know
where you are?

03:31.913 --> 03:34.614
I came here to tell you
I don't want to see you.

03:34.649 --> 03:39.386
Neither does Jenny or Howie,
so stop bothering Mom about it.

03:39.421 --> 03:40.553
What?

03:40.589 --> 03:43.123
Why do you want to see us
anyway?

03:43.158 --> 03:44.457
You don't like us.

03:44.493 --> 03:46.893
John, that is completely untrue.

03:46.928 --> 03:49.562
Uh, all I'm doing is trying
to come up with a--

03:49.598 --> 03:51.398
a reasonable schedule

03:51.433 --> 03:54.067
so you and I can have dinner
together a few nights a week.

03:54.102 --> 03:56.102
Like Scott Cullins,
whose parents got divorced.

03:56.138 --> 03:58.705
Now he has to go Thursdays to
his dad's crummy new apartment

03:58.740 --> 04:00.740
to eat Chinese food
out of the box,

04:00.776 --> 04:03.410
because his dad
doesn't even have plates.

04:03.445 --> 04:05.478
I will have plates,
I can assure you.

04:05.514 --> 04:08.281
You don't even have
a real bed.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.116
I'm gonna find an apartment.

04:10.152 --> 04:14.254
I just, uh, I just haven't
had the time, you know?

04:14.289 --> 04:16.255
Hey, hey, uh, how--
how are you getting to school?

04:16.291 --> 04:17.724
Let me take you.

04:17.759 --> 04:19.793
In what?
You can't drive.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.095
Mom told us
about your accident.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.964
Uh, well, I-I can walk
with you--

04:25.000 --> 04:26.733
With all the other parents
around,

04:26.768 --> 04:29.335
who are completely
on Mom's side?

04:29.404 --> 04:31.304
That would just be
the walk of shame.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.040
Well, hey, but no,
John, wait, wait.

04:34.075 --> 04:35.809
Uh, John.

04:37.846 --> 04:40.513
[Virginia] Each one's
a different hotel, see?

04:40.549 --> 04:42.982
Caesar's Palace,
and The Sands.

04:43.018 --> 04:44.484
Sister Helen would put me
in detention

04:44.519 --> 04:46.486
if I wore this to school.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.121
And what's this?

04:48.156 --> 04:49.756
Casino earrings to match?

04:49.791 --> 04:52.759
No. Ace of Spade cuff links.
For Grandpa.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.527
I meant to give them to him
when we dropped him off

04:54.563 --> 04:55.929
at the airport.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.264
Apparently,
Frank Sinatra

04:58.300 --> 05:01.634
has the exact same pair.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.671
You should've gotten Grandpa
combat pay.

05:04.706 --> 05:08.041
Do you know that Lisa cried
six hours straight last week?

05:08.076 --> 05:10.143
I mean, her face was red,
she was covered in drool.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.478
It got so bad that
we had to call Libby.

05:11.513 --> 05:12.545
Libby?

05:14.316 --> 05:16.783
Was that really necessary?

05:16.818 --> 05:18.284
Well, she came over
and in five minutes,

05:18.320 --> 05:21.688
she got Lisa to stop crying.

05:21.723 --> 05:24.691
Well, I heard that you were
a big help to Grandpa

05:24.726 --> 05:26.493
while I was away.

05:26.528 --> 05:28.461
Now that I'm back at work,
I am going to be relying

05:28.497 --> 05:32.532
on you more to help
with chores, watch Lisa.

05:32.567 --> 05:35.468
Won't Dan be able to help
with that?

05:35.504 --> 05:38.037
Dan will be here as often
as he can, but unfortunately,

05:38.073 --> 05:40.707
he is going to be stuck
in New York quite a bit.

05:42.911 --> 05:45.445
You should know
that Dan called me last week.

05:47.115 --> 05:49.349
To say good-bye.

05:49.384 --> 05:52.552
Since the two of you
were breaking up.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.523
Why would you lie to me
about that?

05:56.558 --> 05:58.258
I wasn't lying.

05:58.293 --> 06:01.895
I was waiting for the right time
to tell you.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.530
That you never got married.

06:03.565 --> 06:06.766
Because it's complicated,
and all I'm saying is

06:06.801 --> 06:09.702
I would appreciate it if
we could keep this between us.

06:09.738 --> 06:12.005
You want me to say
you and Dan are married?

06:12.073 --> 06:16.609
For now. Because... well,
it's important for my work.

06:16.645 --> 06:19.045
It protects me, okay?

06:19.080 --> 06:20.446
If Bill thinks
that I'm married,

06:20.482 --> 06:22.916
then it takes any complications
off the table.

06:22.951 --> 06:25.118
So you don't want to have sex
with Uncle Bill anymore, either.

06:25.153 --> 06:27.086
I don't need a lecture
from you, Tessa.

06:27.122 --> 06:30.423
Especially about something that
you are too young to understand.

06:32.627 --> 06:34.627
No, what you need, Mom,
is a shrink.

06:39.734 --> 06:42.268
What-- what happened
to the cinnamon rolls?

06:42.304 --> 06:44.938
That plate was full
20 minutes ago.

06:44.973 --> 06:46.573
What do you want me to say?

06:46.608 --> 06:48.274
I'm eating for two now.

06:48.310 --> 06:49.876
You're not pregnant;
Helen is.

06:49.911 --> 06:51.711
Yeah, but when she
isn't screaming at me,

06:51.746 --> 06:53.212
she's puking her guts out.

06:53.248 --> 06:54.781
We went in for a check-up,

06:54.816 --> 06:56.583
Barton said he's never seen
nausea so bad,

06:56.618 --> 06:59.752
so I have to, you know,
pick up the slack.

06:59.788 --> 07:01.487
I'm not sure
that's how that works.

07:01.523 --> 07:04.624
Lester, this is as close
as I'm gonna get

07:04.659 --> 07:09.062
to being knocked up, so please,
do not ruin this for me.

07:09.097 --> 07:11.965
Morning.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.833
After a couple of weeks
out in Vegas,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.768
I expect you to show up
with a suntan.

07:15.804 --> 07:19.005
Well, we, uh, didn't leave
the hotel room much.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.507
Oh. I suppose it's safer
to stay inside,

07:21.543 --> 07:24.277
what with the H-bomb tests
and all.

07:24.312 --> 07:25.812
Where's Bill?

07:25.847 --> 07:27.480
Oh, he apparently followed
his son to school.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.682
He mentioned something about
keeping a discreet distance,

07:29.718 --> 07:31.250
like a geisha.

07:31.286 --> 07:32.986
Now that we're done
catching up,

07:33.021 --> 07:35.154
here are the calls
you've missed.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.290
Some of them I told
you were on sabbatical,

07:37.325 --> 07:39.158
some of them I told
you were on safari.

07:39.194 --> 07:41.327
You'll have to sort them out
yourself.

07:41.363 --> 07:42.862
Thank you, Betty.

07:42.897 --> 07:46.299
I hope my being gone
wasn't too much trouble.

07:46.334 --> 07:49.268
Also, Nancy's here to see you.

07:49.304 --> 07:51.204
She's in the doc's office.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.511
Pleasure to meet you.
Nancy Leveau.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.013
Thank you for coming in.

08:00.048 --> 08:02.949
So, what brings you
to the clinic, Mrs. Leveau?

08:02.984 --> 08:05.118
Um, Dr. Leveau, actually.

08:05.153 --> 08:07.220
I'm still getting used
to saying it myself.

08:07.255 --> 08:09.022
I just finished my degree
in May.

08:09.057 --> 08:12.458
And I've been interning
with Dr. Scully since then.

08:12.494 --> 08:16.529
So he's the one who recommended
me to Dr. Masters.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.197
For the position here.

08:18.233 --> 08:21.134
As Dr. Masters' associate.

08:21.169 --> 08:23.536
Dr. Masters hired you?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.138
Oh, no.
Well, not yet.

08:25.173 --> 08:27.206
He told me I'm meet with you
this morning,

08:27.242 --> 08:30.543
and then the two of you
would discuss.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.745
Unless, would you like to wait
for Dr. Masters and--

08:32.780 --> 08:36.049
and the two of you
can interview me together.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.350
Of course not.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.717
That's why you're here.

08:38.753 --> 08:42.855
So Dr. Masters and I
can divide and conquer.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.858
Lester, you'll be seated here
across from Nancy.

08:45.894 --> 08:49.028
Now, obviously this is a bit
unconventional,

08:49.064 --> 08:51.531
but instead of me
interviewing you,

08:51.566 --> 08:55.368
I would like you to interview
Lester and Betty.

08:55.403 --> 08:57.403
I'm not sure I understand.

08:57.439 --> 09:01.007
The intake interview is the
cornerstone of our treatment,

09:01.042 --> 09:04.043
so this isn't a test.
[chuckles]

09:04.079 --> 09:07.413
Just curious, thank you,
to see the natural instincts

09:07.449 --> 09:09.115
that you bring
to the work.

09:09.150 --> 09:13.786
So, your patients here
have been married ten years,

09:13.822 --> 09:16.889
and Lester has recently
begun suffering

09:16.925 --> 09:18.891
from secondary impotence.

09:18.927 --> 09:20.193
Again?

09:20.228 --> 09:22.628
While Betty is unable
to accommodate

09:22.664 --> 09:24.397
the girth
of her husband's penis.

09:24.432 --> 09:26.933
Are we getting paid extra
for this?

09:26.968 --> 09:28.868
You can being whenever
you're ready, Nancy.

09:28.903 --> 09:32.572
And I'll try not to
interrupt you.

09:32.607 --> 09:35.575
Why don't you start by telling
me about the problems--

09:35.610 --> 09:37.443
I'm gonna have to stop you.
Sorry.

09:37.479 --> 09:41.714
Uh, the word "problems"
implies a value judgment.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.282
That you were telling them,
essentially,

09:43.318 --> 09:44.784
that there's something
wrong with them.

09:44.819 --> 09:47.453
Well, I-- well, they are here,
so...

09:47.489 --> 09:49.388
A better choice would be
something more neutral,

09:49.424 --> 09:52.925
like, "What types of issues
have you been dealing with?"

09:52.961 --> 09:54.794
All right.

09:54.829 --> 09:58.397
So then, Mrs...

09:58.433 --> 10:01.100
- Whatever.
- Betty, participate.

10:03.438 --> 10:05.772
McGillicuddy.

10:05.807 --> 10:08.074
What kind of issues
have you been dealing with,

10:08.109 --> 10:10.676
Mrs. McGillicuddy?

10:10.712 --> 10:13.446
It doesn't fit.

10:13.515 --> 10:17.283
Well, the first thing
we'll do is a physical exam--

10:17.318 --> 10:19.585
Oh, I'm gonna have to stop you
again.

10:19.621 --> 10:21.621
Sorry, uh, the-- the first thing
you would do

10:21.656 --> 10:23.456
is actually conduct
a sexual history.

10:23.491 --> 10:26.793
Yes, I considered that,
but I decided against it.

10:26.828 --> 10:29.629
Betty's symptoms are consistent
with vaginismus.

10:29.664 --> 10:31.497
I would first rule out
any physical causes,

10:31.533 --> 10:32.832
such as trauma.

10:32.867 --> 10:35.201
For Lester,
I suspect his condition

10:35.236 --> 10:37.670
may be a direct result
of Betty's vaginismus.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.972
As you and Dr. Masters explained
in the interview last year

10:40.008 --> 10:41.541
in <i> American Medical Journal,</i>

10:41.576 --> 10:43.342
vaginismus can often cause
performance anxiety

10:43.378 --> 10:44.811
in the male partner,

10:44.846 --> 10:47.647
which can manifest
as secondary impotence.

10:51.219 --> 10:53.686
Yes, that's true.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.321
[phone ringing]

10:55.356 --> 10:58.224
Mrs. Masters,
am-- am I expecting you?

10:58.259 --> 11:00.960
No, I just came to drop off
the retainer forms.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.461
Oh.
[chuckles]

11:02.530 --> 11:04.997
Elaine, my secretary,
decided to follow her heart

11:05.033 --> 11:06.899
back to cosmetology school,

11:06.935 --> 11:09.569
so for the moment,
I am my own Gal Friday.

11:09.604 --> 11:11.838
Just-- just-- just put the forms
down on the desk.

11:11.873 --> 11:13.573
Anywhere in particular?

11:13.608 --> 11:15.341
Pick a pile, any pile.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.910
I-- I'll call you later
to discuss; I won't forget.

11:17.946 --> 11:19.879
However, if I do forget,
you can call me.

11:19.914 --> 11:22.248
[phones continue ringing]

11:24.252 --> 11:26.686
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, bye-bye.

11:26.721 --> 11:28.554
You're late,
but if you hurry,

11:28.590 --> 11:31.390
you can catch the tail end of
Virginia's so-called "interview"

11:31.426 --> 11:33.226
with the new girl.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.328
Well, I'm sure Virginia is more
than able

11:35.363 --> 11:37.096
to handle the interview
on her own.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.399
I'll tell her to join you
with the Connollys,

11:40.435 --> 11:42.535
that's the shoe guy,
as soon as she's done.

11:42.570 --> 11:43.936
Actually, uh, I'm gonna be
working

11:43.972 --> 11:45.938
with the Connollys alone.

11:45.974 --> 11:47.940
And after that, I-- I'd like
to take a look at the calendar.

11:47.976 --> 11:49.742
Make sure Virginia and I

11:49.777 --> 11:52.879
are using our time
most efficiently.

11:55.216 --> 11:57.950
I suggest you ask my husband
what he did with my espadrilles.

11:57.986 --> 12:00.853
Or, Dale, maybe you would like
to tell Dr. Masters

12:00.889 --> 12:03.189
what you did
with my Levine Pilgrim Pumps.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.924
At this point, I, uh...
[clears throat]

12:04.959 --> 12:06.759
...I think I can infer.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.562
I paid 10.95 for those pumps.

12:09.597 --> 12:12.865
But how can I-- how can I ever
put my feet into them again?

12:12.901 --> 12:14.567
Knowing how his...

12:14.602 --> 12:16.602
...his seed is deposited
all over them?

12:16.638 --> 12:19.972
Dr. Masters told me that
I should be honest with you.

12:20.008 --> 12:22.241
- [scoffs]
- Tell you what I really want.

12:22.277 --> 12:26.012
This is all your doing,
what he's become.

12:29.183 --> 12:32.218
When I was in high school,

12:32.287 --> 12:34.987
my sister, sh-- she drove
this beautiful

12:35.023 --> 12:37.123
baby blue T-bird.

12:37.158 --> 12:39.091
And in her senior year,
she started to date

12:39.127 --> 12:41.294
the varsity quarterback.

12:41.329 --> 12:45.598
About a month into it,
her car, it started to smell.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.801
And she finally realized
that...

12:48.836 --> 12:51.270
...in order to show his love,

12:51.306 --> 12:53.739
her boyfriend...

12:53.775 --> 12:58.177
...was defecating
in the trunk.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.079
He had become a freak.

13:00.114 --> 13:02.949
I have never even considered
crapping in a car.

13:02.984 --> 13:04.483
And the worst part is,
is--

13:04.519 --> 13:08.621
is just that I thought
my husband loved me.

13:08.656 --> 13:10.756
I thought that he
was attracted to me.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.124
Not my shoes.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.026
- Darleen--
- Don't.

13:16.464 --> 13:19.165
Mrs. Connolly...
[clears throat]

13:19.200 --> 13:21.667
...I understand.
You're distressed.

13:21.703 --> 13:23.336
[scoffs]

13:23.371 --> 13:27.273
But allowing your husband
to express his desire for shoes

13:27.308 --> 13:28.541
is only the first step.

13:30.578 --> 13:32.011
As it were.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.880
Using sensate therapy,
we will train

13:34.916 --> 13:36.816
Mr. Connolly's
libidinal energy,

13:36.851 --> 13:38.284
currently attached
to shoes,

13:38.319 --> 13:39.852
to refocus in a direction

13:39.887 --> 13:42.888
that is sexually satisfying
for you both.

13:45.994 --> 13:48.194
I love you.

13:48.229 --> 13:52.064
Shoes or no shoes,
and...

13:52.100 --> 13:56.168
...I'm willing to try,
if you are.

13:56.204 --> 13:58.537
It's just it's not normal.

13:58.573 --> 14:00.673
All I ever wanted to be
is normal.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.915
[footsteps]

14:12.120 --> 14:16.689
Betty, I need to look
at the Smith's intake.

14:16.724 --> 14:19.658
[ <i>♪ soft music ♪</i> ]

14:19.694 --> 14:20.893
<i>♪</i>

14:20.928 --> 14:23.162
[knocking]
Am I interrupting?

14:23.197 --> 14:26.165
Hardly.
Ejaculatory incompetence.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.900
This could take weeks.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.035
Uh...
[clears throat]

14:29.070 --> 14:31.404
...we should discuss
the schedule.

14:31.439 --> 14:34.206
Okay, uh, I was going
to suggest the same

14:34.242 --> 14:36.008
since I'll be busy
with my column for Hef

14:36.044 --> 14:37.510
in the coming month.

14:37.545 --> 14:39.378
I can handle the details
of the pending court case,

14:39.414 --> 14:40.713
hire an attorney, uh,

14:40.748 --> 14:42.782
keep up with requests
for documents.

14:42.817 --> 14:44.850
Good. Since I was the one
that argued

14:44.886 --> 14:47.620
against the surrogacy program
in the first place.

14:47.655 --> 14:49.255
I'll resume with Little Brown,

14:49.290 --> 14:50.589
try to put the book deal
back together.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.591
Perfect. Since the deal
only collapsed

14:52.627 --> 14:54.460
because you boarded an airplane
to Las Vegas

14:54.495 --> 14:56.395
instead of attending
our book launch.

14:56.431 --> 14:59.131
I will call Barton,
discuss his moving his practice

14:59.167 --> 15:00.733
back with us.

15:00.768 --> 15:02.768
As for speaking engagements,
interviews--

15:02.804 --> 15:05.071
We can decide
on a case-by-case basis.

15:05.106 --> 15:06.772
As for seeing new patients--

15:06.808 --> 15:08.274
We both will,
with our new partners.

15:08.309 --> 15:10.209
I assume you approve
of Dr. Leveau.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.044
She has sterling
qualifications.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.147
Mmm, I would prefer someone
with more clinical experience,

15:15.183 --> 15:17.917
but as long as you don't mind
some hand-holding.

15:17.952 --> 15:19.552
She is very knowledgeable
about the work.

15:19.587 --> 15:21.787
Well, knowing is not the same
as doing.

15:21.823 --> 15:23.389
Whomever we hire,

15:23.424 --> 15:25.558
we will have to keep
a very close eye on them.

15:25.593 --> 15:28.227
So I would like to tighten
our oversight

15:28.262 --> 15:31.063
by having Lester install
recording equipment

15:31.099 --> 15:33.833
in the conference room
and all the exam rooms.

15:33.868 --> 15:36.569
Recording equipment?
To record?

15:36.604 --> 15:39.338
Everything.
Sessions with patients,

15:39.373 --> 15:41.307
conversations between
staff members.

15:41.342 --> 15:44.009
Why? I can't imagine
any new hire

15:44.045 --> 15:46.011
is going to stand
being listened in on.

15:46.047 --> 15:49.815
And yet if we had tape recorders
in this office two months ago,

15:49.851 --> 15:52.451
we wouldn't be staring down
the barrel at criminal charges.

15:52.487 --> 15:55.187
[knocking]

15:55.223 --> 15:57.857
Courier just delivered these
for you.

15:57.892 --> 15:59.658
We're in the middle
of a session, Betty.

15:59.694 --> 16:02.495
You asked me to get you
if any deliveries came for you.

16:02.530 --> 16:05.164
Remember?
So, here I am.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.801
Right. Well, do you know
who they're from?

16:08.836 --> 16:11.704
Was there a card?

16:11.739 --> 16:15.641
"Virginia, counting the hours
until I see you again.

16:15.676 --> 16:17.743
All my love, Dan."

16:20.414 --> 16:24.350
I am going to call Dr. Leveau,
make the official offer.

16:24.385 --> 16:26.018
All right, you can put those
in my office,

16:26.053 --> 16:27.620
and then I need you to pull
together a list

16:27.655 --> 16:29.822
of psychiatrists
for potential new partners.

16:29.857 --> 16:32.191
I need to start that interview
process as soon as possible.

16:32.226 --> 16:34.326
Or...

16:34.362 --> 16:37.062
you could show
a little appreciation

16:37.098 --> 16:38.564
every once in a while.

16:38.599 --> 16:40.533
Whatever it is
you're trying to say,

16:40.568 --> 16:42.801
why don't you just say it?

16:42.837 --> 16:45.538
Okay.
I've spent the past two months

16:45.573 --> 16:47.540
tap-dancing as fast as I can
trying to keep

16:47.575 --> 16:50.009
this business together
with spit and Scotch tape.

16:50.044 --> 16:53.746
And in all that time...
[scoffs]

16:53.781 --> 16:58.083
...I didn't hear so much
as a peep from you.

16:58.119 --> 16:59.718
You're right,
I should have called.

16:59.754 --> 17:01.520
I'm sorry.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.556
- Woulda, coulda, shoulda.
- What do you want me to say?

17:03.591 --> 17:05.558
Words are not
what I'm looking for.

17:05.593 --> 17:07.660
See, Helen is out-to-here
pregnant,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.496
which means
I got another mouth to feed.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.364
Now, I haven't had a raise

17:12.400 --> 17:14.066
since Truman
was in the White House.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.402
Which is a problem,
because in my household,

17:16.436 --> 17:19.070
I am Truman, as in,
the buck stops with me.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.208
As I am also the breadwinner
in my house.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.776
So, why don't we pick a time
next week

17:23.810 --> 17:24.944
to sit down and discuss it.

17:24.979 --> 17:26.744
Unfortunately, right now,

17:26.781 --> 17:29.048
uh, my plate is very full
with everything going on here.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.884
Or we can take care of this
right now.

17:31.919 --> 17:34.086
See,

17:34.121 --> 17:37.423
I have been working here
for ten years.

17:37.458 --> 17:41.560
And I know your handwriting
from a mile away.

17:41.596 --> 17:44.196
Now, I don't know why

17:44.232 --> 17:46.732
you're sending yourself flowers
from Dan,

17:46.767 --> 17:51.470
and... I'm not asking.

17:51.505 --> 17:56.308
What I am asking for
is a little bit of support.

17:58.946 --> 18:01.647
So I made a fearless
moral inventory

18:01.682 --> 18:04.583
of all the people that
did me wrong all these years,

18:04.619 --> 18:06.819
beginning with my mother.

18:06.854 --> 18:09.255
She called the cops on me
last year

18:09.290 --> 18:12.224
because I broke into her
and my stepdad's house

18:12.260 --> 18:13.959
when I knew
that they were at bingo.

18:13.995 --> 18:17.997
[chuckles]
That pissed her off royally.

18:18.032 --> 18:19.798
Irregardless, though,

18:19.834 --> 18:23.168
how does a mother call the cops
on her own flesh and blood?

18:23.204 --> 18:25.137
It's unnatural.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.172
Next person
is my asshole brother.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.283
Why are you in the dark?

18:37.318 --> 18:38.917
Atmosphere.
[chuckles]

18:38.953 --> 18:40.452
I mean, how many times
am I gonna get the chance

18:40.488 --> 18:42.021
to bug an office?

18:42.056 --> 18:43.822
This is as cloak and dagger
as it gets for me.

18:43.858 --> 18:46.692
- And it's all automatic?
- Yeah. Voice-activated.

18:46.727 --> 18:48.527
As soon as the mic picks up
people talking,

18:48.562 --> 18:52.097
the tape recorders in my office
start recording.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.366
- Great.
- Hey, hey.

18:54.402 --> 18:55.868
Can I try something
out on you?

18:55.903 --> 18:58.671
[exhales sharply]

18:58.706 --> 19:00.372
Linden.

19:00.408 --> 19:02.941
Lester Linden.

19:02.977 --> 19:05.010
I could pull it off, right?

19:05.046 --> 19:09.615
No.
Don't do that.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.651
Yeah, okay.

19:12.687 --> 19:14.219
[grunts]

19:16.223 --> 19:17.856
You think you're just going
to sit there

19:17.892 --> 19:20.359
waiting on me
to take you home?

19:20.394 --> 19:22.628
If you're here,
you're working.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.396
Help me with these chairs.

19:29.003 --> 19:30.869
And don't think I didn't see
the way you were looking

19:30.905 --> 19:33.072
at Kevin tonight.

19:33.107 --> 19:34.840
Hmm.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.975
If I had a penny
for every one of those looks,

19:37.011 --> 19:38.911
I'd be driving
a Cadillac.

19:38.946 --> 19:40.846
And what look is that?

19:40.881 --> 19:43.048
That look that says,
"This guy?

19:43.084 --> 19:45.217
"I got nothing in common
with this guy.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.653
"Well, why am I in the same room
with this guy?

19:47.688 --> 19:50.723
In fact, why am I here
with any of these people?"

19:50.758 --> 19:52.558
The thought has crossed
my mind.

19:52.593 --> 19:55.361
Now, I'm not saying
he entirely understood

19:55.396 --> 19:57.196
the point of the fourth step.

19:57.231 --> 20:00.499
Oh, that, uh, a fearless
moral inventory

20:00.534 --> 20:03.202
isn't simply a list of excuses
for why everyone else

20:03.237 --> 20:06.205
in the world is to blame
for your own poor choices?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.774
That's not an uncommon mistake,

20:08.809 --> 20:12.010
to-- to blame others first
before you look at yourself

20:12.046 --> 20:15.681
and the destruction you caused,
but he is trying.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.250
Which is more than I can say
for some of us

20:18.285 --> 20:21.086
who haven't even started
the first step.

20:21.122 --> 20:24.423
See, that's the problem
with this program of yours.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.059
The interminable steps.

20:27.094 --> 20:29.261
Belaboring everything.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.897
Change is a process,
not an event.

20:31.932 --> 20:34.733
[groans]
And there's the other problem.

20:34.769 --> 20:37.236
The endless slogans.

20:37.271 --> 20:41.273
With all the profundity
of a fortune cookie.

20:41.308 --> 20:45.611
Hmm. Well, I guess
you got it all wired.

20:45.646 --> 20:47.746
I didn't say "all wired."

20:50.584 --> 20:54.920
Although, a week ago,

20:54.955 --> 20:56.722
my business was in shambles.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.224
Now, it's up and running.

20:59.260 --> 21:02.161
Even begun to hire
new employees.

21:02.196 --> 21:05.731
And tonight,
I'm going to go see my wife,

21:05.766 --> 21:08.834
and hammer out
a custody arrangement.

21:08.869 --> 21:10.769
Ex-wife.

21:10.805 --> 21:12.337
For your information,
the divorce papers

21:12.373 --> 21:13.906
aren't even drafted yet.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.607
Soon-to-be-ex-wife.

21:15.643 --> 21:20.479
Point is... if you're looking
for a success story,

on sexology and behaviorism.

34:30.670 --> 34:31.735
Oh.

34:31.771 --> 34:33.204
You probably don't remember,

34:33.239 --> 34:35.639
but I did ask you
a question,

34:35.708 --> 34:37.208
what single quality

34:37.244 --> 34:39.944
did you think all great
psychologists had in common?

34:39.980 --> 34:43.281
The ability to treat a patient
without any judgment

34:43.315 --> 34:45.216
is usually my standard answer.

34:45.252 --> 34:47.284
And that was it.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.420
You said, if a patient
walks in your door,

34:49.456 --> 34:51.989
and he says he's currently
having a sexual relationship

34:52.025 --> 34:54.659
with a seal,
your first question should be,

34:54.694 --> 34:57.228
"Do you prefer the north or
the south side of the island?"

34:57.264 --> 34:58.630
Oh.
You know, I don't remember

34:58.665 --> 35:00.331
exactly what I said.

35:00.367 --> 35:03.167
Well, it left a strong
impression on me.

35:03.203 --> 35:06.271
And since I prefer the north
side of the island,

35:06.306 --> 35:08.673
when Nancy said you
and Dr. Masters

35:08.708 --> 35:10.975
were looking for psychiatrists,
I pleaded with her to get me in.

35:11.011 --> 35:14.612
And you and Dr. Leveau,
you grew up together?

35:14.648 --> 35:17.949
We went to medical school
together at McGill.

35:17.984 --> 35:21.252
Nancy grew up in Montreal,
just a few miles from campus.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.754
So Nancy would invite me
to stay

35:22.789 --> 35:24.122
with her family
for the holidays.

35:24.157 --> 35:25.590
My father works
for the government.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.492
They move him around
every few years.

35:27.527 --> 35:30.194
I was born in Singapore,
raised in Virginia.

35:30.230 --> 35:34.499
Hmm. And it says that you have
an MD in psychiatry.

35:34.534 --> 35:38.136
You didn't pursue
an advanced degree?

35:38.171 --> 35:42.106
I was under the impression that
a medical degree was advanced.

35:42.142 --> 35:44.809
Well, we're primarily
considering applicants

35:44.844 --> 35:46.477
with PhDs for this job.

35:46.513 --> 35:49.180
I'm so sorry that Dr. Leveau
didn't mention that.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.382
[sighs] You know,
I've always found

35:51.418 --> 35:53.618
the more degrees
on a psychiatrist's walls,

35:53.653 --> 35:55.119
the higher the probability

35:55.155 --> 35:58.356
he's either a charlatan
or a horse's ass.

35:58.391 --> 36:01.192
Or both.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.128
And after school,
you went to...

36:04.164 --> 36:05.863
The Kinsey Institute.

36:05.899 --> 36:07.632
I did a research fellowship
there.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.634
Any particular area of focus?

36:09.669 --> 36:12.704
Marriage. Specifically,
the role of sex in marriage.

36:12.739 --> 36:15.973
As you can imagine,
your book was my bible.

36:16.009 --> 36:17.141
Hmm.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.843
I went through two copies.

36:18.878 --> 36:21.646
The first got so dog-eared,
the pages feel out.

36:21.681 --> 36:24.082
Well, that's very flattering.

36:24.117 --> 36:27.018
But, as I said, uh,
we are primarily considering

36:27.053 --> 36:28.986
applicants with more advanced
credentials.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.521
I understand, Mrs. Johnson.

36:30.557 --> 36:33.358
I'm just honored
you're considering me at all.

36:38.064 --> 36:39.897
Nervous?

36:39.933 --> 36:41.499
No, not nervous.

36:41.534 --> 36:42.900
I'm-- I'm ready for this.

36:46.539 --> 36:49.674
Uh, I was going to suggest
that you take the lead

36:49.709 --> 36:51.509
in the exam room.

36:51.544 --> 36:54.846
Walk the Connollys through
the basics of sensate.

36:54.881 --> 36:57.682

massage, or kiss</i>

36:57.717 --> 36:59.283

36:59.319 --> 37:02.954
aside from the genitals
and breasts.

37:02.989 --> 37:04.989
Did you want to add anything,
Dr. Masters?

37:07.127 --> 37:11.396
You might also
remove the slippers.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.601
But I-I thought that we agreed

37:16.636 --> 37:18.136
that my--
my feet are off-limits.

37:18.171 --> 37:20.605
We did.
And through the sensate therapy,

37:20.673 --> 37:22.774
we hope to refocus
your husband's desire

37:22.809 --> 37:24.976
on to more acceptable parts
of your body,

37:25.011 --> 37:29.814
but if that refocusing leads
to his hiding his desire,

37:29.849 --> 37:33.918
then that desire
becomes something else.

37:33.953 --> 37:35.453
A secret.

37:37.657 --> 37:40.491
A secret in a marriage

37:40.527 --> 37:43.461
is very hard to survive.

37:43.496 --> 37:44.996
You have a better chance

37:45.031 --> 37:47.432
if you can find your pleasure
together.

37:47.500 --> 37:52.270
You know, meet each other

Uh, I just-- I don't think
that I can do that.

rationalization.

find a way to rationalize it

you felt no remorse.
