Marker.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.047
Jamal!

03:16.173 --> 03:18.175
Jamal, are you awake?

03:19.175 --> 03:21.261
I know you can hear me.

03:21.678 --> 03:25.558
l´m writing all this down.
I have that thing with your teacher...

03:25.683 --> 03:30.312
...then l´m working late. So you´lI have to
take care of yourseIf for dinner, okay?

03:31.188 --> 03:32.898
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:37.694 --> 03:40.448
I thought you wanted to get up by 7:30.

03:55.213 --> 03:56.714
Hear the chains sing?

03:56.714 --> 03:58.632
Check that up, man.

03:59.216 --> 04:01.844
Hold on. What up, J? Where you been?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.221
Asleep, yo.

04:04.221 --> 04:07.224
I was up late
wondering how l´d save your ass out here.

04:07.224 --> 04:09.184
What are you saving?

04:10.728 --> 04:12.730
J, break him up, man.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.738
You can´t give him that.

04:21.738 --> 04:24.616
-You can´t give him that.
-l´m awake now.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.914
You got something for me?

04:31.248 --> 04:32.958
Soufflé, baby!

04:37.754 --> 04:39.840
You got nothing for me.

04:40.257 --> 04:42.509
A lot of good that´s doing.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.764
He´s bringing something for the Window.

04:47.764 --> 04:50.267
-You ever seen him?
-The Window?

04:50.767 --> 04:52.853
No, but he see us, man.

04:58.276 --> 04:59.776
Come on, man.

04:59.776 --> 05:03.155
What´s wrong with y´all?
Don´t you want to play ball?

05:03.781 --> 05:05.240
Wake up.

05:11.287 --> 05:12.832
In 1845...

05:13.290 --> 05:16.376
...Poe wrote his most famous piece,
The Raven.

05:16.793 --> 05:20.965
A poem he wrote while he was strung out
on coke and obsessed with death.

05:21.297 --> 05:23.800
The Raven is like the football team.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.346
They´re obsessed with death,
always get their ass kicked.

05:28.305 --> 05:32.310
Baltimore Ravens: only pro football team
named after a classic poem.

05:32.809 --> 05:34.561
Anyone read it?

05:35.312 --> 05:37.648
´´Once upon a midnight dreary

05:38.815 --> 05:41.401
´´while I pondered weak and weary´"

05:43.820 --> 05:45.781
Jamal, how about it?

05:48.826 --> 05:50.619
I never read it.

05:52.829 --> 05:55.707
Okay, I need those essays by next Tuesday.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.342
My dad saw the Window, man.
About 20 years ago.

06:05.342 --> 06:09.179
Standing there like a ghost,
like the ones in our science books.

06:09.346 --> 06:10.347
Just like that, man.

06:10.347 --> 06:12.348
-He was white?
-Ain´t milk white?

06:12.348 --> 06:14.351
What ghost isn´t white?

06:14.351 --> 06:15.853
l´m just playing, man.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.855
I heard he killed someone.
That´s why he stays inside.

06:18.855 --> 06:21.358
Listen, you got to kill an army
to have to hide here.

06:21.358 --> 06:25.654
Y´all play too much. Remember Shurrita?
The one who lived below the Window?

06:27.364 --> 06:30.367
She calls me up
this one night buggin´, dog.

06:31.368 --> 06:35.372
Saying how she heard a tapping sound
coming from the Window´s place.

06:35.872 --> 06:37.291
Tap....

06:40.877 --> 06:44.130
While she was on the phone,
she started screaming.

06:44.381 --> 06:48.010
´Cause now the tapping has made its way
downstairs somehow.

06:48.385 --> 06:49.803
Tap....

06:53.390 --> 06:56.392
And now it was on the other side
of her door.

06:56.392 --> 06:59.813
She could tell he was tapping
with some kind of knife.

07:00.397 --> 07:04.610
And then the phone disconnected.
That was the last time we seen Shurrita.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.570
Shurrita who lived across the street?

07:08.905 --> 07:10.407
That girl is a crack ho.

07:10.407 --> 07:12.242
No, she was nice.

07:12.409 --> 07:15.036
All I know is the Window´s bad news.

07:15.411 --> 07:16.412
Rules was...

07:16.412 --> 07:19.416
...if you went outside, you stayed away
from the Window´s place.

07:19.416 --> 07:21.918
We need to stay away from your lying ass.

07:21.918 --> 07:23.420
You believe me, right?

07:23.420 --> 07:25.463
You full of shit, dog.

07:25.922 --> 07:27.257
Damn.

07:27.424 --> 07:30.301
Let me guess. You´d go up in there, right?

07:31.427 --> 07:33.430
lt´s an old man looking out a window.

07:33.430 --> 07:34.932
You´d go up there, right?

07:34.932 --> 07:37.434
-He won´t go.
-Let them know, J.

07:37.934 --> 07:40.562
-He won´t go.
-This nigga´s scared.

07:40.937 --> 07:43.064
Yo, I got the next call.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.066
-So?
-So...

07:45.442 --> 07:47.943
...I dare you to go up there, right?

07:47.943 --> 07:49.321
Right?

07:49.947 --> 07:52.657
Whatever, man. l´ll go up there. Yeah.

07:52.949 --> 07:53.950
-He´s going.
-Big shot.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.452
Bring it on.

07:55.452 --> 07:57.162
That´s my dog.

07:58.454 --> 08:00.498
D, I believe you, dog.

08:00.957 --> 08:03.500
Shut up. Go to class or something.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.129
Here, man. Sit over here.

08:07.464 --> 08:09.966
-Stop playing with me.
-This is my birthday.

08:09.966 --> 08:10.967
Go over there.

08:10.967 --> 08:14.261
-Fine. I won´t sit near you.
-Take your apple, too.

09:22.539 --> 09:24.499
-Miss Joyce?
-Yeah.

09:25.542 --> 09:28.544
-Good to see you.
-You, too. Come, sit down.

09:32.048 --> 09:34.508
We got Jamal´s test scores back.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.053
-Test scores?
-Assessment tests.

09:37.053 --> 09:39.931
All of the kids are required to take them.

09:41.057 --> 09:43.310
He didn´t tell you, did he?

09:45.061 --> 09:48.064
Mrs. Wallace,
Jamal maintains a C average...

09:48.565 --> 09:52.777
...which means he does enough to get by
and just enough not to stand out.

09:53.070 --> 09:56.447
What makes Jamal´s case unusual
are his test results.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.665
Oh, my God.

10:07.082 --> 10:10.879
I see him reading these books all the time.
Books I never read.

10:11.587 --> 10:15.758
Some l´ve never even heard of.
And he´s always writing in his notebooks.

10:16.593 --> 10:19.845
Ever since his father left.
But that´s what I see.

10:21.597 --> 10:24.309
All he ever talks about is basketball.

10:25.101 --> 10:28.021
Basketball is where he gets his acceptance.

10:28.105 --> 10:31.107
The kids here don´t care about
what he can write.

10:31.107 --> 10:33.693
Let´s go! Between the yellow lines!

10:34.109 --> 10:35.110
Yo, T.

10:35.110 --> 10:37.613
-How are you, Fly?
-Maintaining.

10:39.614 --> 10:42.118
You looking for tickets, little bro?

10:42.118 --> 10:44.538
Dead tonight. Sorry about that.

10:44.621 --> 10:46.622
Come on. We know you got tickets.

10:46.622 --> 10:48.624
I got four words for you:

10:48.624 --> 10:50.500
Boss Tunn Red Sox.

10:52.628 --> 10:56.173
The Yanks and Sox tickets
have been sold out for a month.

10:56.632 --> 10:58.926
Okay, Mr. Fly? By the way...

10:59.135 --> 11:02.847
...go tell Camry boy there
to back up his cheap-ass bumper...

11:04.640 --> 11:06.642
...on that Mercedes over there.

11:06.642 --> 11:09.019
Go handle that. Let´s go, Fly!

11:11.147 --> 11:13.649
What the hell, Jamal? Mom called.

11:14.150 --> 11:17.153
-Told me about that test. What´s up?
-Nothing.

11:17.153 --> 11:19.154
What do you mean, ´´nothing´´?

11:19.154 --> 11:21.657
This getting in the way
of your plans or something?

11:21.657 --> 11:23.868
lt was your plan first, T.

11:24.659 --> 11:26.662
Yeah, I know. A little college ball...

11:26.662 --> 11:30.499
...then start signing checks for everyone,
solve their problems.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.085
Look at me, though.

11:35.671 --> 11:37.381
Hold a minute.

11:39.175 --> 11:40.967
Hold onto these.

11:42.177 --> 11:44.764
I guess this makes it our plan now.

11:45.682 --> 11:47.224
One thing.

11:48.684 --> 11:51.187
Don´t tell nobody about them test scores.

11:51.187 --> 11:53.188
Don´t worry. l´m your brother, dog.

11:53.188 --> 11:55.858
Whatever we discuss stays between us.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.195
Love you, dog. All right?

11:59.195 --> 12:01.322
Just remember one thing.

12:01.698 --> 12:05.743
Mom will know when the game ends,
so you take your ass straight home.

12:06.702 --> 12:10.580
Don´t get into no trouble, man. Be careful.
Stay safe. Love, dog.

12:11.206 --> 12:14.085
-Okay, T. Good lookin´.
-Be careful, man.

12:15.211 --> 12:17.088
lt stinks in here.

12:17.213 --> 12:20.716
J, see that window?
He keeps that one cracked sometimes.

12:21.216 --> 12:23.719
The light´s been out for two hours.

12:23.719 --> 12:25.221
You sure he asleep?

12:25.221 --> 12:28.974
That Methuselah´s a thousand years old.
That´s all he ever do.

12:30.226 --> 12:33.270
Yo, J, for the reals, I don´t know about this.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.648
I think l´m-- Shit!

12:37.733 --> 12:40.069
I think l´m pulling the call.

12:40.235 --> 12:42.529
-No, I got this one.
-Rats.

12:43.738 --> 12:47.035
-Yo, Fly.
-Keep it. You got to bring something out.

12:47.743 --> 12:50.287
Man, you hear us, drop down, okay?

12:51.247 --> 12:52.582
Okay.

12:53.249 --> 12:55.584
Don´t stay in there too long.

12:55.751 --> 12:57.294
I got you.

12:59.254 --> 13:01.048
This is rickety.

16:02.938 --> 16:05.398
Oh, shit! Yo, you got something?

16:05.940 --> 16:07.942
-Shit!
-What happened?

16:07.942 --> 16:09.444
You son of a bitch!

16:09.444 --> 16:11.446
Dickheads, he wasn´t asleep.

16:11.446 --> 16:13.949
-Did you see him?
-Not for long.

16:18.954 --> 16:21.831
Stop bouncing that damn ball in the house.

16:22.957 --> 16:26.461
I got Michael Jordan´s name
written in dirt all over my floor.

16:26.461 --> 16:27.963
Don´t worry, l´ll clean it.

16:27.963 --> 16:30.966
I got a better chance
of Michael Jordan cleaning it.

16:30.966 --> 16:34.469
If you´re thinking of a shower,
the hot water´s a bit slow.

16:34.469 --> 16:37.513
-I wasn´t thinking of it.
-Where´s your pack?

16:40.476 --> 16:42.936
-I don´t know.
-´´Don´t know´´?

16:43.478 --> 16:45.981
What do you mean, you don´t know?

16:45.981 --> 16:48.983
We wanted you to bring something,
not leave something.

16:48.983 --> 16:50.985
Why don´t you leave it alone?

16:50.985 --> 16:52.988
What was in your bag?

16:53.988 --> 16:56.575
l´m not talking about the damn bag.

16:56.992 --> 16:58.786
I bet you ain´t.

16:58.993 --> 17:01.955
Let me teach you something.
Watch the eyes.

17:02.497 --> 17:04.915
He´s probably watching you now.

17:08.502 --> 17:11.882
You don´t know about that, man.
Here´s how you do it.

18:10.064 --> 18:12.524
I won´t do anything to your car.

18:12.566 --> 18:13.944
Sorry?

18:14.069 --> 18:16.572
You look worried,
like l´ll do something to your car.

18:16.572 --> 18:20.241
I worry about this car everywhere.
Don´t take it personally.

18:20.575 --> 18:22.077
lt´s just a car, man.

18:22.077 --> 18:24.870
No, it´s not ´´just a car.´´ lt´s a BMW.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.582
Anyone who knows anything
about that company...

18:28.582 --> 18:31.086
...knows that it´s more than ´´just a car.´"

18:31.086 --> 18:33.589
Anybody who knows about that company?

18:33.589 --> 18:36.090
So I wouldn´t know anything like that.

18:36.090 --> 18:38.384
No, that´s not what I meant.

18:39.094 --> 18:41.470
Last thing I knew about BMW...

18:41.595 --> 18:44.600
...was it made plane engines
when it first started.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.727
A guy by the name of Franz Popp
started it all.

18:48.603 --> 18:50.938
Franz Popp. I like that name.

18:52.106 --> 18:55.568
Made this one engine before 1920.
lt flew six miles up.

18:57.611 --> 19:00.616
Popp and his boys
were just getting started.

19:00.616 --> 19:04.494
They made this one engine, the 801,
World War ll, 14 cylinders...

19:04.619 --> 19:07.247
...2,300 horsepower, seven miles up.

19:10.124 --> 19:13.627
With more time, they´d have bombed
the shit out of England...

19:13.627 --> 19:15.839
...maybe even won the war.

19:16.631 --> 19:18.966
That´s where this comes from.

19:19.133 --> 19:22.011
White propeller zipping around a blue sky.

19:22.637 --> 19:26.140
After the war, we told them
they couldn´t make plane engines.

19:26.140 --> 19:29.685
That´s when BMW
gave some serious thought to making cars.

19:31.646 --> 19:33.648
Kind of like this one.

19:33.648 --> 19:36.984
You probably knew all that,
seeing as you lease one.

19:37.151 --> 19:39.529
Thanks for the history lesson.

19:40.155 --> 19:41.947
No problem, man.

21:00.234 --> 21:02.486
Messin´ with my stuff, man.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.294
The other night was....

22:01.294 --> 22:04.381
lt was just this dare thing
me and my boys do.

22:21.815 --> 22:25.319
I was wondering
if I could bring you more of my stuff...

22:26.320 --> 22:28.322
...or maybe I could write something else.

22:28.322 --> 22:32.201
How about 5,000 words on
why you´ll stay the fuck out of my home?

23:15.869 --> 23:18.538
Come on, man. I know you´re in there.

23:22.376 --> 23:24.961
Take your goddamn hand off my door.

23:26.380 --> 23:28.090
I just came...

23:28.382 --> 23:31.301
...to drop off that thing you asked me for.

23:31.385 --> 23:32.970
What thing?

23:33.387 --> 23:37.182
The 5,000 words on why you wanted me
to stay out of your place.

23:37.390 --> 23:39.393
That´s kind of what you said.

23:39.393 --> 23:42.479
Well, try remembering it
exactly as I said it.

24:12.425 --> 24:13.928
Come on in, Jamal.

24:13.928 --> 24:15.470
Hi, honey.

24:16.430 --> 24:17.973
lt´s okay.

24:18.933 --> 24:20.433
Sit down.

24:21.434 --> 24:25.063
Mrs. Wallace, Jamal,
when we got your recent test scores...

24:25.439 --> 24:28.943
...we thought the private schools
might show some interest.

24:28.943 --> 24:30.903
Well, we were right.

24:32.946 --> 24:35.783
-Mr. Bradley.
-My name is David Bradley.

24:37.450 --> 24:39.452
l´m with the Mailor School in Manhattan.

24:39.452 --> 24:41.163
Mailor-Callow?

24:41.455 --> 24:43.957
That´s right. You´re familiar with us?

24:43.957 --> 24:45.292
Yeah.

24:45.459 --> 24:49.171
Mailor-Callow is not only
the best prep school in the city...

24:49.463 --> 24:52.466
...it´s one of the finest private schools
on the East Coast.

24:52.466 --> 24:53.967
Only the best go there.

24:53.967 --> 24:56.469
We´re a few weeks into our fall term...

24:56.469 --> 25:00.557
...but every year we hold some openings
until the test scores come in.

25:01.975 --> 25:04.936
Jamal, your test scores, to put it mildly...

25:05.478 --> 25:07.606
...caught our attention.

25:08.482 --> 25:12.277
l´m here to see if you´d be interested
in attending our school.

25:16.990 --> 25:20.995
Leaving for another school,
especially a private one, won´t be easy.

25:20.995 --> 25:24.122
But this isn´t the right place
for you anymore.

25:24.998 --> 25:26.999
lt´s not a difficult choice.

25:26.999 --> 25:28.709
Mr. Bradley...

25:30.003 --> 25:32.839
...there is no way we could pay for this.

25:33.006 --> 25:35.133
We´re not asking you to.

25:36.009 --> 25:39.012
When Dr. Simon said
only the best go to Mailor...

25:39.012 --> 25:43.308
...he forgot to say our commitment
to excellence goes beyond the classroom.

25:44.016 --> 25:46.812
-I figured that.
-We thought you might.

25:47.021 --> 25:50.982
Mrs. Wallace, 40 of our students
have gone on to play college ball.

25:52.025 --> 25:55.570
Three have made it to professional level.
We evaluated...

25:56.029 --> 25:59.532
...your play last year
and while this is a strictly academic offer...

25:59.532 --> 26:02.327
...we won´t be disappointed if you play.

26:02.536 --> 26:05.997
All we ask is you come out,
take a look, think it over.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.042
-Okay.
-Mrs. Wallace.

26:09.042 --> 26:11.003
-Thank you.
-Jamal.

26:12.044 --> 26:14.464
-Good-bye.
-We´ll be in touch.

27:03.596 --> 27:05.098
I didn´t knock this time.

27:05.098 --> 27:09.269
-To whom were you speaking?
-l´ll tell you if I get my 5,000 words back.

27:50.643 --> 27:53.188
Bolt the door if you´re coming in.

28:00.153 --> 28:02.071
The man in the car?

28:07.661 --> 28:10.121
He was from this private school.

28:11.164 --> 28:13.333
They want me to go there.

28:16.168 --> 28:18.880
We don´t have to pay anything, though.

28:20.672 --> 28:23.802
My mom and I live
a couple of blocks from here.

28:26.179 --> 28:30.183
My brother was there a few years ago,
but he left after my dad left.

28:46.699 --> 28:50.035
My mom got tired of waiting
for my dad to get clean.

28:51.203 --> 28:53.622
And my dad got tired of trying.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.210
That´s when I started writing.

28:57.210 --> 28:59.044
What´s your name?

28:59.211 --> 29:00.922
Jamal Wallace.

29:01.214 --> 29:03.800
Sounds like some kind of marmalade.

29:04.716 --> 29:06.510
How old are you?

29:07.219 --> 29:08.637
l´m 16.

29:08.721 --> 29:10.181
Sixteen?

29:11.224 --> 29:13.059
And you´re black.

29:16.228 --> 29:18.814
-lt´s remarkable.
-´´Remarkable´´?

29:19.732 --> 29:24.111
lt´s remarkable l´m black? What does me
being black have to do with anything?

29:29.742 --> 29:32.745
You don´t know what to do right now,
do you?

29:32.745 --> 29:36.749
If you say what you really want to,
I may not read any more of this.

29:37.750 --> 29:41.379
But if you let me run you down
with this racist bullshit...

29:43.756 --> 29:46.008
...what does that make you?

29:50.262 --> 29:52.681
l´m not playing this game, man.

29:53.265 --> 29:55.433
I say you are playing it.

29:55.767 --> 29:58.563
An expression is worth a thousand words.

30:01.273 --> 30:03.693
Perhaps in your case, just two.

30:09.281 --> 30:10.616
Here.

30:27.801 --> 30:29.593
Bum-ass old man.

30:35.808 --> 30:39.644
´´One hand to give, one to receive,
as we eat together in unity.

30:40.312 --> 30:43.483
´´May our minds,
bodies and spirits grow strong.

30:44.317 --> 30:47.069
´´And congratulations to Jamal. Amen.´"

30:49.822 --> 30:51.323
Did you see this?

30:51.323 --> 30:53.784
-Let me see.
-Don´t mess it up.

30:54.827 --> 30:55.828
Wait.

30:55.828 --> 30:58.830
From the cover,
this looks like the funny-man school to me.

30:58.830 --> 31:00.834
Terrell, eat your food.

31:00.834 --> 31:04.253
You´ll be fine.
Mommy don´t make nothing but soldiers.

31:04.336 --> 31:06.339
You could have done the same thing.

31:06.339 --> 31:09.925
I work at a parking lot,
and l´m no regular lot attendant.

31:10.342 --> 31:13.762
I am the supervisor
of all the parking lot attendants.

31:13.845 --> 31:16.849
You never know how much you´ll make
from week to week.

31:16.849 --> 31:19.351
One week it´s $50, the next it´s $100.

31:19.351 --> 31:21.854
-That´s not a real job.
-Ma, leave him alone.

31:21.854 --> 31:24.689
I rap. You know I got my rap thing going.

31:25.357 --> 31:27.860
Don´t bring up the rap. Eat your food.

31:27.860 --> 31:29.861
-Want to hear a song?
-Eat your food.

31:29.861 --> 31:31.364
l´ll sing it for you.

31:31.364 --> 31:33.866
´´When I come due
When I blow the spot

31:33.866 --> 31:36.994
´´Your son, the supervisor
Of the parking lot´´

31:38.871 --> 31:41.623
Tell it, Jamal, my voice is hot, right?

32:28.295 --> 32:30.005
Jamal Wallace?

32:30.297 --> 32:32.715
-Yeah?
-Hi. l´m Claire Spence.

32:35.303 --> 32:37.930
Bradley asked me to show you around.

32:38.305 --> 32:39.848
All right.

32:43.810 --> 32:45.270
Come on.

32:55.822 --> 32:58.158
Besides, the teachers here...

32:58.325 --> 33:01.202
...aren´t that into student participation.

33:01.328 --> 33:03.330
They prefer to hear themselves talk.

33:03.330 --> 33:05.791
-What do you mean?
-You´lI see.

33:06.333 --> 33:10.253
This morning, we begin
our third required reading of the semester.

33:10.337 --> 33:12.839
The study of a novel
that offers everything...

33:12.839 --> 33:16.092
...and an author
who could have offered much more.

33:20.348 --> 33:24.351
That´s Robert Crawford. He´s been here
as long as most of the buildings.

33:24.351 --> 33:27.187
When William Forrester was 23, in 1953...

33:28.355 --> 33:31.066
...he set out to write his first book.

33:31.358 --> 33:35.529
Many aspiring authors talked about
writing the great 20th century novel.

33:36.864 --> 33:39.116
William Forrester did it...

33:39.366 --> 33:40.868
...on his first try.

33:40.868 --> 33:42.786
Have you read this?

33:43.370 --> 33:44.913
Yeah. You?

33:45.372 --> 33:47.374
Only about a dozen times.

33:47.374 --> 33:50.334
This was the only book
he chose to publish.

33:50.376 --> 33:53.839
For all we know,
it was the only one he chose to write.

33:55.382 --> 33:58.969
Your job over the next week
is to read it and tell me why.

33:59.386 --> 34:00.720
So...

34:01.888 --> 34:03.890
...will you be back tomorrow?

34:03.890 --> 34:06.893
Yeah. They want me to spend some time
on the court.

34:06.893 --> 34:08.353
I heard.

34:08.395 --> 34:11.648
Graduation was a little rough
on last year´s team.

34:12.399 --> 34:14.943
But it´s just like college, right?

34:15.402 --> 34:18.612
You get an education
and they get what they want.

34:18.905 --> 34:20.907
Maybe you both get what you want.

34:20.907 --> 34:22.284
Maybe.

34:24.411 --> 34:27.039
lt was very nice meeting you, Jamal.

34:27.414 --> 34:30.417
You, too, Claire.
Will you be around tomorrow?

34:30.417 --> 34:32.668
Not where you´ll be, but...

34:32.918 --> 34:35.338
...you might find me for lunch.

34:43.429 --> 34:46.683
-I didn´t say those two words yesterday.
-Why not?

34:47.434 --> 34:50.061
I want you to read more of my stuff.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.568
They talk a lot about you out there.

34:57.444 --> 34:59.446
All this legend bullshit.

34:59.446 --> 35:03.074
They got some stories.
People wonder if you killed someone.

35:03.950 --> 35:06.453
That, and wondering why
you been in here so long.

35:06.453 --> 35:10.123
I wouldn´t move. lt´s quiet.
You don´t hear nothing in here.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.877
Our place has noisy neighbours.

35:14.461 --> 35:17.464
Their kid is always yelling,
´cause he´s a year old...

35:17.464 --> 35:19.966
...or pops yells
´cause the kid is making noise.

35:19.966 --> 35:24.678
Then mom, on top of that, is yelling.
But it´s a different kind of yelling, ´cause...

35:25.472 --> 35:29.976
...the old man´s playing tunes for her and
she´s banging her head against the wall...

35:29.976 --> 35:32.103
...and she´s screaming--

35:32.479 --> 35:34.689
You better stir that soup.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.816
What?

35:37.984 --> 35:40.488
Stir the soup before it firms up.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.996
Why doesn´t ours get anything on it?

35:49.996 --> 35:51.790
Come on. Closer.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.500
Now.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.503
You got someone
doing that kind of yelling?

35:56.503 --> 35:59.422
What I have is an adult male. Quite pretty.

36:02.009 --> 36:04.427
Probably strayed from the park.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.559
A Connecticut warbler.

36:12.019 --> 36:14.729
You ever go outside to do any of this?

36:15.522 --> 36:18.525
You should have stayed
with the soup question.

36:18.525 --> 36:22.779
The object of a question is to obtain
information that matters only to us.

36:26.031 --> 36:29.244
You were wondering
why your soup doesn´t firm up?

36:29.536 --> 36:32.538
Probably because your mother
was brought up in a house...

36:32.538 --> 36:35.041
...that never wasted milk in soup.

36:35.041 --> 36:39.295
That question was a good one,
in contrast to, ´´Do I ever go outside?´´...

36:42.048 --> 36:46.595
...which fails to meet the criteria of
obtaining information that matters to you.

36:47.554 --> 36:51.057
All right. I guess I don´t have
any more soup questions.

36:52.559 --> 36:53.809
No?

36:54.059 --> 36:56.562
Why´d you say all that stuff
about me being black?

36:56.562 --> 36:59.440
lt had nothing to do with you being black.

36:59.566 --> 37:03.111
I wanted to find out
how much bullshit you´d put up with.

37:04.071 --> 37:06.072
-So you knew l´d come back?
-Yes.

37:06.072 --> 37:09.075
Just like I know
you´ll go to this new school.

37:09.075 --> 37:10.076
How do you know?

37:10.076 --> 37:14.748
Because there´s a question in your writing
about what you wish to do with your life.

37:15.582 --> 37:19.294
That is a question your present school
cannot answer for you.

37:24.090 --> 37:27.050
Let´s match up.
Wallace, you take Hartwell.

37:30.097 --> 37:32.099
What´s up? l´m Jamal.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.767
Just check it, all right?

37:37.604 --> 37:39.355
Check the ball.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.065
Come on.

37:44.109 --> 37:45.653
Ball´s in.

37:52.118 --> 37:53.870
Play him tough.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.417
Way to go, gang.

38:02.629 --> 38:04.756
D up. Let´s go, garbage.

38:05.131 --> 38:06.590
Come on.

38:07.133 --> 38:08.593
Step up.

38:14.139 --> 38:17.144
Why don´t you leave
the trash-talking back home?

38:17.144 --> 38:19.938
What? Get that goofy look off your face.

38:20.647 --> 38:23.148
-l´m gonna make you my son right now.
-Right.

38:23.148 --> 38:25.610
-You gonna be my son.
-Come on.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.161
Let´s go.

38:37.664 --> 38:39.665
-Come on, man.
-What?

38:39.665 --> 38:41.500
You´re too small.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.676
A little defence would be real nice.

38:49.676 --> 38:52.386
Coach, you´re right. A little defence.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.682
-Try to get past the line.
-What?

38:55.682 --> 38:57.891
I said, get past the line.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.187
Pressure.

39:03.690 --> 39:05.191
Too much.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.531
I need some help!

39:11.697 --> 39:14.324
Ten seconds. Let´s go the other way.

39:29.716 --> 39:31.216
-l´m taking your spot.
-What?

39:31.216 --> 39:33.218
-l´m taking your spot.
-You take nothing.

39:33.218 --> 39:34.678
Come on.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.902
My court, babe. My court.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.743
That´s how we play it down here.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.411
That´s right.

40:02.248 --> 40:05.250
John Hartwell´s just a rich kid
who wants as much of the spotlight...

40:05.250 --> 40:07.754
...as he can get in his senior year.
That´s all it is.

40:07.754 --> 40:11.674
-They take things real serious around here.
-lt´s a serious place.

40:13.259 --> 40:17.346
Serious enough that I end up here
getting lunch on my books most days.

40:18.264 --> 40:20.640
What´s that you´re working on?

40:21.266 --> 40:23.102
Forrester´s book.

40:23.269 --> 40:27.064
-You said you read it a dozen times.
-I know, but look at this.

40:27.273 --> 40:30.276
My dad got it for me. lt´s an early printing.

40:37.783 --> 40:40.286
-Listen, I got to go.
-But you just got here!

40:40.286 --> 40:44.123
I know, but, I forgot something.
I got to check up on something.

40:46.292 --> 40:48.209
l´lI see you later.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.566
´´Born: 1930...

41:10.315 --> 41:12.234
´´...in Scotland.´"

41:20.326 --> 41:23.745
´´Moved to New York
with his family in his late teens.

41:24.831 --> 41:27.916
´´Mr. Forrester was unavailable
for comment.´´

41:28.834 --> 41:30.753
Yeah, I bet he was.

41:30.795 --> 41:34.005
Are we now planning
to make these visits a habit?

41:35.841 --> 41:37.843
You said you knew l´d come back.

41:37.843 --> 41:40.388
Yes, but I thought you meant once.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.349
I need some help with a thing at school.

41:43.349 --> 41:45.726
Yes. This ´´thing´´ at school.

41:46.351 --> 41:49.354
And what ´´thing´´
are we talking about now?

41:54.860 --> 41:56.779
You ever read that?

42:01.366 --> 42:05.079
l´m trying. I just can´t seem to get past
the first 10 pages.

42:09.374 --> 42:11.084
As I recall...

42:12.377 --> 42:15.589
...it took awhile
to get past those pages myself.

42:18.383 --> 42:22.680
Christ, you´ve dog-eared one of them.
Show a little respect for the author.

42:29.394 --> 42:31.397
That´s you, isn´t it?

42:32.398 --> 42:34.274
You´re the author.

42:36.401 --> 42:40.029
I read the whole thing. lt´s not bad.
Especially the part--

42:41.906 --> 42:43.784
I know what it is.

42:43.910 --> 42:47.412
The last thing I need is another person
telling me what they think it is.

42:47.412 --> 42:48.914
I wasn´t going to say that.

42:48.914 --> 42:52.834
What were you going to say?
I should tell you everything about me?

42:52.918 --> 42:54.419
I told you about me.

42:54.419 --> 42:57.839
You could learn a little something
about holding back.

43:31.957 --> 43:35.044
If I ask you not to say anything
to anybody...

43:35.960 --> 43:37.921
...about here, us...

43:39.965 --> 43:42.759
...is that something I can trust you on?

43:47.472 --> 43:48.807
Yeah.

43:49.474 --> 43:51.018
I promise.

43:51.977 --> 43:53.311
Fine.

43:54.980 --> 43:58.316
And if I ask you to keep helping me
with my writing?

44:12.998 --> 44:15.624
There´ll be no questions about me...

44:16.000 --> 44:19.046
...my family,
or why there was only one book.

44:20.005 --> 44:21.840
Then I won´t ask.

44:23.008 --> 44:24.343
Good.

44:24.509 --> 44:26.260
And good night.

44:36.522 --> 44:38.481
What´s it feel like?

44:39.524 --> 44:40.525
What?

44:40.525 --> 44:43.069
Writing something the way you did.

44:44.529 --> 44:46.656
Perhaps you´ll find out.

45:03.549 --> 45:05.925
Listen, you 5-foot nothing....

45:08.053 --> 45:10.471
That´s what l´m saying, though.

45:13.558 --> 45:15.060
Kenzo, how old are you?

45:15.060 --> 45:16.352
Why?

45:16.560 --> 45:19.565
Look at your face!
Your mom didn´t do that to you?

45:19.565 --> 45:21.566
She started you young.

45:21.566 --> 45:24.861
Know where that comes from?
Eating too much cookie.

45:27.571 --> 45:29.323
Teresa told me.

45:29.574 --> 45:32.577
I like ´em big.
You got a problem with that?

45:32.577 --> 45:35.497
-Nothing wrong with a big girl!
-That big?

45:35.580 --> 45:40.001
lt don´t make a difference. lt´s like
when l´m with all three of your mothers.

45:40.084 --> 45:41.586
-Not my mother.
-Yeah.

45:41.586 --> 45:43.879
Hold on, Oscar Mayer wiener.

45:44.088 --> 45:48.718
Stop playing, man. You got beat like Tina
in school one day. I seen Duke smack you.

45:49.093 --> 45:53.140
Listen, throw it at your mama.
Every day, throw it towards your mama.

45:54.099 --> 45:56.601
Your mama. Stop throwing your mama.

45:56.601 --> 45:59.020
lt´s all in your tank, brother.

45:59.104 --> 46:00.604
Why you laughing?

46:00.604 --> 46:03.399
Man, your glasses are like Coke bottles.

46:05.611 --> 46:07.111
Classics.

46:08.613 --> 46:11.575
-You ever met somebody famous?
-How famous?

46:12.116 --> 46:14.369
Like, I don´t know, like...

46:15.620 --> 46:17.997
...somebody people would know.

46:18.122 --> 46:20.917
Nobody like that comes around here, man.

46:24.629 --> 46:26.840
Are you here for good now?

46:27.632 --> 46:30.301
Yeah. l´m just trying to get started.

46:34.138 --> 46:36.557
At least they look good, right?

46:48.653 --> 46:53.158
You´ll all be pleased to know this year´s
writing competition has been scheduled.

46:53.158 --> 46:56.161
For those choosing to take part,
all entries must be turned in...

46:56.161 --> 47:00.748
...before spring break, which means you
have a few months of procrastination left.

47:02.666 --> 47:06.128
Feel free to experiment
with a more proactive approach.

47:09.674 --> 47:11.301
Mr. Wallace?

47:11.676 --> 47:13.095
Please.

47:15.179 --> 47:19.141
I had a chance to review the files
sent over by your former school.

47:21.685 --> 47:23.688
Test scores, impressive.

47:23.688 --> 47:26.524
Actual classroom work, not so impressive.

47:28.193 --> 47:31.278
ls this the level of work
I should anticipate?

47:37.201 --> 47:39.161
Because, if it is...

47:40.205 --> 47:44.083
...it will help me determine
whether to treat you as a student...

47:44.208 --> 47:47.962
...or as someone who is here to pursue,
how should I put it...

47:48.712 --> 47:50.673
...other endeavours?

47:51.716 --> 47:55.553
Of course, your work will give you
ample opportunity to respond.

47:57.723 --> 47:59.765
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

48:05.729 --> 48:08.940
Just so you know,
you handled that the right way.

48:09.232 --> 48:10.860
How is that?

48:11.236 --> 48:14.822
You didn´t say anything.
The ones who do run into trouble.

48:15.740 --> 48:18.242
-John Coleridge.
-Jamal Wallace.

48:21.245 --> 48:23.747
So, how many people do say something?

48:23.747 --> 48:26.918
And actually stay in Crawford´s class?
Not many.

48:29.254 --> 48:31.338
I missed what you said.

48:32.256 --> 48:34.300
I didn´t say anything.

48:38.762 --> 48:40.681
You read all these?

48:40.764 --> 48:43.935
No, I just keep them
to impress all my visitors.

48:45.770 --> 48:47.647
All your visitors.

48:48.272 --> 48:50.775
We´ve been talking
about your book at school.

48:50.775 --> 48:55.445
People have been talking about it for years.
They just haven´t been saying anything.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.283
I think I got it down, though.

48:58.283 --> 49:01.786
I figure you were writing about
how life never works out.

49:01.786 --> 49:05.038
Really? You had to read a book
to figure that out?

49:06.790 --> 49:09.502
But Crawford´s messed up on it anyhow.

49:10.294 --> 49:13.298
He says the guy having trouble
after the war is really you.

49:13.298 --> 49:17.468
Some symbolism shit for all the problems
you were having with everybody.

49:18.302 --> 49:20.096
Robert Crawford?

49:20.304 --> 49:24.642
Yeah. I think it´s bullshit, though.
I think there really was somebody else.

49:32.317 --> 49:34.026
Mr. Johannsen?

49:34.318 --> 49:35.653
Here.

49:35.820 --> 49:39.281
Mr. Massie.
Another trip to your favourite destination.

49:40.324 --> 49:42.826
l´ve got four bags.
I can just leave them if you like.

49:42.826 --> 49:44.077
No.

49:46.831 --> 49:48.541
Come right in.

49:48.833 --> 49:50.834
How you doing, Mr. Johannsen?

49:50.834 --> 49:53.337
lt´s at least a haIf hour before the sun sets.

49:53.337 --> 49:57.049
Then you can begin
your panic-driven quest back to Manhattan.

49:58.342 --> 50:00.844
This should last you till next week.

50:00.844 --> 50:03.014
Your mail is in this one.

50:03.848 --> 50:05.349
Mr. Johannsen?

50:05.349 --> 50:07.851
-The essentials are in--
-Essentials?

50:07.851 --> 50:11.522
I took care of your bills.
I put all the copies in this one.

50:12.355 --> 50:15.860
The phone company wants to know
if you want to continue service...

50:15.860 --> 50:18.862
...seeing as you haven´t had a call
in about--

50:18.862 --> 50:22.575
I got your socks for the next few weeks.
They´re in this one.

50:23.366 --> 50:26.203
I have your latest check from accounting.

50:26.870 --> 50:31.124
They want to know if you cashed
the last one. lt´s showing up outstanding.

50:31.375 --> 50:33.920
Not as outstanding as it once was.

50:38.883 --> 50:41.885
l´m sorry.
I didn´t realise you had company.

50:41.885 --> 50:44.596
We were just having a discussion on...

50:45.388 --> 50:48.476
...German automobile history.
Care to join us?

50:49.393 --> 50:52.437
-No, l´m in the tow-away.
-Of course you are.

50:52.896 --> 50:54.398
See you next week?

50:54.398 --> 50:56.233
Not if l´m lucky.

51:01.905 --> 51:05.409
Why don´t you give that guy a break
and do your own shopping?

51:05.409 --> 51:07.412
Why are your socks inside out?

51:07.412 --> 51:08.912
Socks are badly designed.

51:08.912 --> 51:12.082
The seams are on the inside.
They hurt the toes.

51:13.416 --> 51:17.170
In some cultures, it´s good luck
to wear something inside out.

51:17.921 --> 51:19.423
You believe that?

51:19.423 --> 51:22.426
No. But it´s like praying.
What do you risk?

51:22.927 --> 51:26.763
And I do go outside. How do you think
those windows get cleaned?

51:29.932 --> 51:32.519
Now, about this professor of yours.

51:33.938 --> 51:37.357
How did it feel having him tell you
what you can´t do?

51:38.442 --> 51:40.444
Like he knew he was better than me.

51:40.444 --> 51:43.071
Then let´s show him what you can do.

51:44.448 --> 51:46.949
Why is it the words we write
for ourselves...

51:46.949 --> 51:51.038
...are always so much better
than the words we write for others? Move.

51:54.458 --> 51:55.751
Sit.

52:05.469 --> 52:06.971
Go ahead.

52:07.972 --> 52:09.472
Go ahead and what?

52:09.472 --> 52:10.849
Write.

52:12.976 --> 52:14.478
What are you doing?

52:14.478 --> 52:18.315
l´m writing. Like you´ll be,
when you start punching those keys.

52:24.989 --> 52:26.489
ls there a problem?

52:26.489 --> 52:28.533
No. l´m just thinking.

52:28.992 --> 52:31.369
No thinking. That comes later.

52:35.498 --> 52:37.834
You write your first draft...

52:38.502 --> 52:40.421
...with your heart.

52:40.504 --> 52:42.756
You rewrite with your head.

52:47.010 --> 52:49.387
The first key to writing is...

52:50.513 --> 52:52.141
...to write.

52:52.516 --> 52:54.184
Not to think.

53:04.528 --> 53:05.903
Jesus.

53:43.067 --> 53:45.735
ls there a chance you might sit down?

54:03.586 --> 54:06.714
´´A Season of Faith´s Pefection.´"
What´s this?

54:07.089 --> 54:08.966
Start typing that.

54:09.092 --> 54:13.263
Sometimes the simple rhythm of typing
gets us from page one to page two.

54:15.098 --> 54:18.643
When you begin to feel your own words,
start typing them.

54:41.625 --> 54:44.002
Punch the keys for God´s sake!

54:54.137 --> 54:55.430
Yes!

54:59.643 --> 55:01.770
You´re the man now, dog.

56:05.708 --> 56:07.085
Jamal?

56:07.710 --> 56:10.421
Whatever we write in this apartment...

56:11.213 --> 56:13.466
...stays in this apartment.

56:14.217 --> 56:15.927
No exceptions.

56:47.876 --> 56:50.086
Okay, let´s push it, guys.

56:56.384 --> 56:59.386
-That´s a foul.
-What do you mean? I had the spot.

56:59.386 --> 57:01.889
l´ll let you know when you got the spot.

57:01.889 --> 57:06.644
Gentlemen, our season begins in one week.
If I see this kind of thing one more time...

57:07.395 --> 57:10.564
...l´lI have you shooting fouls
to see who runs.

57:10.898 --> 57:12.817
ls that understood?

57:12.900 --> 57:14.193
One.

57:20.408 --> 57:21.700
Two.

57:25.413 --> 57:26.789
Three.

57:30.417 --> 57:31.836
Eleven.

57:35.924 --> 57:37.342
Twelve.

57:40.428 --> 57:41.929
Thirteen.

57:43.930 --> 57:45.557
Twenty-nine.

57:53.942 --> 57:55.567
Forty-eight.

57:58.946 --> 58:00.531
Forty-nine.

58:05.453 --> 58:06.912
Hold it.

58:08.956 --> 58:10.458
One more.

58:23.470 --> 58:27.058
That was one of the most
impressive things l´ve ever seen.

58:27.975 --> 58:30.978
Why do I know it wasn´t good enough
for either one of you?

58:30.978 --> 58:33.355
Shower up and get out of here.

58:35.983 --> 58:38.778
You may think we´re the same. We´re not.

58:46.493 --> 58:48.120
Mr. Wallace?

58:49.997 --> 58:51.624
Mr. Wallace.

58:51.999 --> 58:53.000
Professor.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.503
The latest paper you turned in...

58:57.504 --> 59:01.008
...displayed quite a bit of improvement
from your earlier work.

59:01.008 --> 59:02.884
-Thank you.
-Yes.

59:03.009 --> 59:05.012
How long did it take to write?

59:05.012 --> 59:06.513
I wrote it last night.

59:06.513 --> 59:08.098
Last night.

59:09.016 --> 59:11.936
Well, I have some things to finish up here.

59:12.019 --> 59:14.062
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

59:22.029 --> 59:24.032
That´s right. Select again.

59:24.032 --> 59:26.992
-´´Birds of a Feather´´ for $600.
-Answer..

59:27.034 --> 59:30.537
´´Vibrant in colour, its name borrows
from a Vivien Leigh character. ´´

59:30.537 --> 59:32.039
Scarlet tanager.

59:32.039 --> 59:34.542
No, it´s ´´What is the scarlet tanager?´"

59:34.542 --> 59:36.042
What is the scarlet tanager?

59:36.042 --> 59:38.546
See, you have to know the rules
to play the game.

59:38.546 --> 59:41.757
lt was written by a writer
you´ve never heard of.

59:42.549 --> 59:45.094
´´Thy duty, winged flame of spring

59:46.554 --> 59:48.680
´´is but to love and fly

59:49.056 --> 59:52.642
´´and sing´´ He was writing about
the song of the tanager.

59:53.560 --> 59:56.147
A song about new seasons, new life.

59:58.565 --> 01:00:00.567
That´s James Lowell, man.

01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:02.403
I know who he is.

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:06.365
l´ll stay with ´´Poor Assumptions´"
for $800, Alex.

01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:10.578
Ever seen any scarlet tanagers
around here?

01:00:10.578 --> 01:00:13.372
They don´t stray that far from the park.

01:00:19.086 --> 01:00:22.923
So, your professor wasn´t exactly
full of praise this afternoon?

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:25.218
Not exactly.

01:00:26.093 --> 01:00:29.597
There´s something you should know
about Robert Crawford.

01:00:31.598 --> 01:00:34.351
He wrote a book a few years after mine.

01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:38.813
All the publishers rejected it,
which was the right decision.

01:00:40.607 --> 01:00:43.110
lnstead of writing another one...

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.197
...he took a job
teaching others how to write.

01:00:48.615 --> 01:00:50.117
How do you know all that?

01:00:50.117 --> 01:00:53.454
Just remember that bitterly
disappointed teachers...

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.666
...can be either very effective...

01:00:57.625 --> 01:00:59.626
...or very dangerous.

01:01:46.673 --> 01:01:50.343
Okay, this is the first step tonight, guys.
Mailor on three.

01:01:51.678 --> 01:01:53.805
One, two, three, Mailor!

01:02:20.707 --> 01:02:22.334
Gold. Black.

01:02:25.211 --> 01:02:27.339
Straight and high, boys.

01:02:39.726 --> 01:02:40.727
What up, J?

01:02:40.727 --> 01:02:43.480
-You was in there tonight?
-26 points.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:46.733
8 out of 10 from the floor,
10 from 10 from the line.

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:47.734
l´m supposed to miss that?

01:02:47.734 --> 01:02:49.236
lt was hot.

01:02:49.236 --> 01:02:52.238
You were putting some serious ink
on that stat page.

01:02:52.238 --> 01:02:54.032
What´s going on?

01:02:55.242 --> 01:02:58.619
Brothers are going to Red Rose.
I said we´d catch up.

01:02:58.745 --> 01:03:00.747
Friday night. Come on.

01:03:00.747 --> 01:03:03.625
Jamal, you plan on doing that every night?

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:06.837
-Worked out, I guess.
-l´d say so.

01:03:09.255 --> 01:03:10.757
This is Fly.

01:03:10.757 --> 01:03:13.551
Hi. l´m Claire. You a friend of Jamal´s?

01:03:13.759 --> 01:03:15.553
Claire! Come on.

01:03:15.762 --> 01:03:17.348
l´m coming.

01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:21.184
Don´t hold up the bus too long.
Nice meeting you, Fly.

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:24.937
What the hell you working there, man?

01:03:26.272 --> 01:03:27.941
Shut up, man.

01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:31.318
Yo, about Red Rose....

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.783
I got to go to this dude´s house.
They do it every year.

01:03:37.283 --> 01:03:38.785
Don´t go off on this.

01:03:38.785 --> 01:03:42.205
You big time. Go on.
I don´t want to hold your bus up.

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:44.791
Will you be around this weekend?

01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.626
Where do you think l´ll be? The Hamptons?

01:04:39.346 --> 01:04:42.848
Very nice talking with you.
Now, if you need anything...

01:04:42.848 --> 01:04:45.268
...please give me a call. Okay?

01:04:47.353 --> 01:04:48.687
Okay.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.696
Building up a collection of those things?

01:04:57.864 --> 01:04:59.490
Yeah, a few.

01:04:59.865 --> 01:05:02.285
Want to go outside for a while?

01:05:02.368 --> 01:05:04.579
Yeah. You know this place?

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:07.749
I live in this place. Come on.

01:05:16.382 --> 01:05:20.219
They´ll be congratulating themselves
on your game till midnight.

01:05:20.887 --> 01:05:24.683
Which means l´lI have to cram tomorrow
for this test on Monday.

01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:26.393
Test on what?

01:05:26.393 --> 01:05:28.394
On the Sherlock Holmes books.

01:05:28.394 --> 01:05:31.397
They have us tracking down
all this worthless stuff like:

01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:33.857
Who introduced Watson to Holmes?

01:05:33.899 --> 01:05:37.570
They give it to you
´cause it forces you to read everything.

01:05:38.404 --> 01:05:40.824
Looks like it might be a while.

01:05:40.907 --> 01:05:42.409
Maybe so.

01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:45.912
So this friend, Fly,
how long have you known each other?

01:05:47.413 --> 01:05:50.416
A while. He was born there
and I was born there, too.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:52.334
-The Bronx?
-Yeah.

01:05:52.918 --> 01:05:54.421
Must be hard.

01:05:54.421 --> 01:05:55.755
What?

01:05:56.422 --> 01:05:58.508
New people, new school.

01:05:59.426 --> 01:06:00.926
lt´s not?

01:06:01.427 --> 01:06:02.678
No.

01:06:02.928 --> 01:06:07.349
What´s hard is growing up in a place
cops don´t even want to be in after dark.

01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:11.271
What´s hard is knowing you´re safe there.

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:15.942
´Cause the people you need to worry about,
know you´ve got nothing to give them.

01:06:16.943 --> 01:06:19.445
So it´s a good thing you´re here.

01:06:21.447 --> 01:06:24.951
These people don´t think
I got anything to give them, either.

01:06:24.951 --> 01:06:28.413
Don´t let me get by you.
Once I get by you, l´ll score.

01:06:29.455 --> 01:06:32.333
Ready? Now stay in front of me, all right?

01:06:33.459 --> 01:06:35.002
All right?

01:06:37.963 --> 01:06:39.632
I got by you.

01:06:39.965 --> 01:06:42.093
You´re bigger than I am.

01:06:42.969 --> 01:06:44.971
lt doesn´t matter. You still got to defend.

01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:46.806
How do I do that?

01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:50.852
How do you play defence?
l´ll show you one way, here.

01:06:51.476 --> 01:06:53.103
Turn around.

01:06:57.483 --> 01:06:58.985
Feel that?

01:06:58.985 --> 01:07:00.486
I feel it.

01:07:00.486 --> 01:07:03.989
Now I know where you´ll go,
because I can feel you move.

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:06.868
Try and move left.

01:07:08.994 --> 01:07:12.374
See, you can´t get around me.
I feel you moving left.

01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:14.834
Try and go right.

01:07:17.503 --> 01:07:19.004
l´m still here.

01:07:19.004 --> 01:07:22.508
I feel when you try to go right,
so you can´t go there, neither.

01:07:22.508 --> 01:07:24.551
Now try and get by me.

01:07:26.011 --> 01:07:27.472
Hold on.

01:07:28.515 --> 01:07:30.516
You have to dribble first.

01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:32.602
Dribble. Okay. Like....

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.063
Like this?

01:07:39.024 --> 01:07:40.860
-Sorry.
-Claire.

01:07:42.027 --> 01:07:43.404
Daddy?

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.449
Some of our guests are leaving.

01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:49.368
l´lI see you on Monday, okay?

01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:03.466
Claire?

01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:05.885
Yeah?

01:08:06.051 --> 01:08:07.845
lt was Stamford.

01:08:08.554 --> 01:08:10.055
Excuse me?

01:08:10.055 --> 01:08:11.556
At the bar in London.

01:08:11.556 --> 01:08:14.561
He was the one
who introduced Watson to Holmes.

01:08:14.561 --> 01:08:18.439
Might actually save you some time
after everyone´s done in there.

01:08:25.571 --> 01:08:28.073
You know how long
l´ve been working on that?

01:08:28.073 --> 01:08:32.828
lt ain´t one season of faith´s perfection.
Feels like I worked on it for two or three.

01:08:37.582 --> 01:08:40.836
You´re in that place
where you can´t even hear me.

01:08:41.086 --> 01:08:45.090
I could ask why you never left
this neighbourhood, and you wouldn´t--

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:47.260
Paragraph three starts...

01:08:48.094 --> 01:08:50.513
...with a conjunction, ´´and.´"

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:54.099
You should never start a sentence
with a conjunction.

01:08:54.099 --> 01:08:56.059
-Sure you can.
-No.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.603
lt´s a firm rule.

01:08:57.603 --> 01:08:58.854
No.

01:08:59.104 --> 01:09:03.568
lt was a firm rule. Sometimes using
a conjunction at the start of a sentence...

01:09:04.109 --> 01:09:08.113
...makes it stand out. And that may be
what the writer´s trying to do.

01:09:08.113 --> 01:09:10.116
And what is the risk?

01:09:10.615 --> 01:09:12.492
Doing it too much.

01:09:13.118 --> 01:09:16.621
lt´s a distraction
and could give your piece a run-on feeling.

01:09:16.621 --> 01:09:21.294
But the rule on using ´´and´´ or ´´but´´
at the start of a sentence is pretty shaky.

01:09:22.127 --> 01:09:25.130
Even though it´s still taught
by too many professors.

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:29.341
Some of the best writers have ignored
that rule for years, including you.

01:09:32.639 --> 01:09:35.724
Well, you´ve taken something
which was mine...

01:09:37.643 --> 01:09:40.729
...and made it yours.
Quite an accomplishment.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:45.149
Thank you.

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:47.652
The title´s still mine, isn´t it?

01:09:49.654 --> 01:09:51.115
I guess.

01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:54.744
lt was the neighbourhood that changed,
not me.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.661
I ain´t seen nothin´ changed.

01:09:56.661 --> 01:10:00.748
You ´´ain´t seen nothin´´´?
What in the hell kind of sentence is that?

01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:05.546
In here, don´t talk like you do out there.

01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:08.632
I was messin´ with you, man.
lt was a joke.

01:10:12.677 --> 01:10:17.099
Tell me about the neighbourhood back
when people were still reading your book.

01:10:17.682 --> 01:10:19.518
What did you say?

01:10:22.688 --> 01:10:23.688
Nothing.

01:10:23.688 --> 01:10:27.234
You said ´´back when people
were still reading my book.´´

01:10:29.194 --> 01:10:30.779
Didn´t you?

01:10:38.204 --> 01:10:40.163
We have 24 copies...

01:10:40.205 --> 01:10:42.958
...but l´m sorry, they are checked out.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:48.088
Thank you, anyway.

01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:54.219
Any luck?

01:10:56.222 --> 01:10:58.223
Did you get on the waiting list?

01:10:58.223 --> 01:11:00.434
Your book was checked out.

01:11:01.727 --> 01:11:03.227
And, yes...

01:11:03.227 --> 01:11:05.355
...I did pay for dinner.

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:08.483
lt cost me $13, so you made your point.

01:11:10.235 --> 01:11:13.738
I tried to call to see what food you wanted,
but the phone kept ringing.

01:11:13.738 --> 01:11:16.241
I took the bell out 20 years ago.

01:11:22.248 --> 01:11:23.749
Let me ask you something.

01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:25.959
Why does a guy like you...

01:11:28.253 --> 01:11:31.256
...waste his time reading
National Enquirer?

01:11:31.256 --> 01:11:33.258
What´s wrong with it?

01:11:34.259 --> 01:11:35.260
lt´s trash, man.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.263
You should be reading
The Times or something.

01:11:38.263 --> 01:11:40.641
I read The Times for dinner...

01:11:42.267 --> 01:11:44.478
...but this is my dessert.

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:47.563
They got some writing contest at school.

01:11:47.772 --> 01:11:50.275
-You ever enter one of those?
-A writing contest?

01:11:50.275 --> 01:11:51.985
-Yeah.
-Once.

01:11:52.777 --> 01:11:55.239
-A long time ago.
-Did you win?

01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:58.324
Well, of course I won.

01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:00.911
Like money or something?

01:12:01.787 --> 01:12:03.455
The Pulitzer.

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:09.794
They make all the students
read in front of everyone.

01:12:09.794 --> 01:12:12.297
What the hell´s that got to do with writing?

01:12:12.297 --> 01:12:16.176
Writers write so that readers can read.
Let someone else read it.

01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:18.803
You ever read your own book?

01:12:18.803 --> 01:12:20.763
In public? Hell, no.

01:12:21.305 --> 01:12:23.599
I barely read it in private.

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:28.021
You know those things they do,
that coffee shop reading shit?

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:31.066
Do you know why they do it?

01:12:31.816 --> 01:12:33.318
To sell books, I guess.

01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:35.695
Because they want to get laid.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.823
Really? Women will sleep with you
if you write a book?

01:12:38.823 --> 01:12:41.952
They´ll sleep with you
if you write a bad book.

01:12:43.328 --> 01:12:45.914
-Did it ever happen to you?
-Sure.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:51.002
Did you ever get married?

01:12:52.837 --> 01:12:55.423
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

01:12:56.341 --> 01:12:58.135
No, I never did.

01:13:01.346 --> 01:13:03.849
But I learned a few things along the way...

01:13:03.849 --> 01:13:07.643
...which might help with this young lady
you always talk about.

01:13:09.354 --> 01:13:10.896
Like what?

01:13:13.358 --> 01:13:15.694
The key to a woman´s heart...

01:13:15.861 --> 01:13:18.988
...is an unexpected gift
at an unexpected time.

01:13:20.365 --> 01:13:22.867
You´re giving me advice on women?

01:13:22.867 --> 01:13:25.370
Unexpected gift, unexpected time.

01:13:28.373 --> 01:13:30.417
This is so unexpected.

01:13:34.379 --> 01:13:37.090
lt´s not a first printing or anything.

01:13:37.882 --> 01:13:39.383
Oh, my gosh.

01:13:39.383 --> 01:13:41.802
-What?
-This is a signed copy.

01:13:42.888 --> 01:13:45.890
I can´t accept this.
lt must have cost a fortune.

01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:48.393
lt didn´t cost that much, really.

01:13:48.894 --> 01:13:51.270
Maybe the bookstore missed it.

01:13:52.397 --> 01:13:55.232
Bookstores don´t usually miss this stuff.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.904
How´d you end up going to Mailor?

01:13:59.905 --> 01:14:02.866
Mailor was originally an all-boys´ school...

01:14:02.907 --> 01:14:06.494
...so, my father did
what anyone in his position would do.

01:14:07.912 --> 01:14:10.415
He got on the board and changed the rules.

01:14:10.415 --> 01:14:12.750
And every kid there knows it.

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:14.920
They´d have done it anyway.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.673
That doesn´t change anything.
l´m still Dr. Spence´s daughter.

01:14:24.428 --> 01:14:27.223
That night at my home, after the game...

01:14:27.432 --> 01:14:30.727
...when you were showing me
how to play basketball:

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:35.439
Was that all you were showing me?

01:14:37.442 --> 01:14:39.611
That´s not going to work.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.278
What?

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:43.281
That.

01:14:43.447 --> 01:14:44.908
Why not?

01:14:47.452 --> 01:14:49.245
Ask your father.

01:14:49.955 --> 01:14:53.332
l´m not asking for some kind
of prenuptial agreement.

01:14:54.959 --> 01:14:56.960
lt´s just a question.

01:14:57.461 --> 01:15:00.757
Why must everything be
so black and white with you?

01:15:03.968 --> 01:15:05.970
I forgot the question.

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.764
You don´t forget anything, Mr. Stamford.

01:15:23.488 --> 01:15:27.366
You don´t think he wrote it?
That´s a serious accusation, Robert.

01:15:27.992 --> 01:15:30.494
You come to the Faculty Board with this....

01:15:30.494 --> 01:15:32.914
l´m aware of how serious it is.

01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:35.000
lt´s remarkable work.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.001
You recognize any of it?

01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:39.087
lt smacks of something.

01:15:40.004 --> 01:15:41.839
But I don´t know.

01:15:42.506 --> 01:15:46.177
The boy does well in my class.
He had good scores coming in.

01:15:47.512 --> 01:15:49.514
Maybe he just needed direction.

01:15:49.514 --> 01:15:52.600
Carl, he´s a basketball player
from the Bronx.

01:15:53.017 --> 01:15:55.728
Who happens to have won 17 straight...

01:15:56.521 --> 01:15:59.106
...for a school that likes winning.

01:16:00.524 --> 01:16:03.653
Have you considered
he might just be that good?

01:16:09.034 --> 01:16:10.743
Not this good.

01:17:00.584 --> 01:17:03.629
Do you know
what the absolute best moment is?

01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:07.383
When you´ve finished your first draft...

01:17:08.092 --> 01:17:10.512
...and you read it by yourself.

01:17:11.595 --> 01:17:13.764
Before these arseholes...

01:17:14.098 --> 01:17:17.392
...take something
they couldn´t do in a lifetime...

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:20.729
...and tear it down in a single day.

01:17:22.606 --> 01:17:24.859
People love that book, man.

01:17:25.109 --> 01:17:27.361
I didn´t write it for them.

01:17:28.612 --> 01:17:32.074
And when the critics
started all this bullshit about...

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:36.078
...what it was I was really trying to say...

01:17:37.622 --> 01:17:39.832
...well, I decided then...

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:43.211
...one book was enough.

01:17:44.628 --> 01:17:47.256
William, that was 50 years ago, man.

01:20:58.947 --> 01:21:02.159
I actually spent money on these tickets.
Come on.

01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:04.453
ls it still light outside?

01:21:04.453 --> 01:21:06.204
lt´s nighttime.

01:21:14.462 --> 01:21:15.798
Well?

01:21:16.965 --> 01:21:19.468
You look good. lt´s not the latest stuff--

01:21:19.468 --> 01:21:21.720
I wasn´t asking how I look.

01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:25.432
-I was asking, are we ready to go?
-Yeah. Come on, man.

01:21:27.475 --> 01:21:28.976
Let´s go.

01:21:34.483 --> 01:21:35.942
Come on.

01:21:46.494 --> 01:21:48.706
We play here in two weeks.

01:21:49.998 --> 01:21:53.335
I said, we play here in two weeks.
State tournament.

01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:14.480
Hold on. Let me get a programme.

01:22:49.558 --> 01:22:50.893
Damn.

01:24:06.133 --> 01:24:08.345
Let´s get you out of here.

01:24:10.138 --> 01:24:11.681
I got you.

01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:42.920
You used to get out, right?

01:24:43.671 --> 01:24:45.673
Yeah, a long time ago.

01:24:45.673 --> 01:24:47.675
-What happened?
-How should I know?

01:24:47.675 --> 01:24:50.135
I didn´t keep track of the time.

01:24:50.177 --> 01:24:52.638
Sorry for losing you back there.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:53.681
No apology needed.

01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:57.435
Good. l´ve got one more place.
lt´s quiet and on the way home.

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.400
You only got 10 minutes.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.902
All right.

01:25:06.902 --> 01:25:08.445
Take that.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.089
Ground level.

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:30.301
´´The house that Ruth built.´"

01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.642
Why did you bring me here?

01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:41.186
Because it´s your birthday.

01:25:42.939 --> 01:25:45.316
I looked it up in the almanac.

01:25:45.942 --> 01:25:48.820
You´re not in the dead people section yet.

01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:56.326
I figure with all the games you watched...

01:25:57.954 --> 01:26:00.749
...with whoever you watched them with...

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:02.958
...you probably never got this close.

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.420
What are they doing on the dirt?

01:26:05.962 --> 01:26:10.007
Who cares? You acting like
they´re going to play a World Series game.

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:12.342
Relax.

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:15.555
My brother and I,
we were here for every game.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:21.143
Till he left for the war.

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:26.815
I thought it´d be the same
when he came back, but...

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:30.319
...he talked a little less...

01:26:30.987 --> 01:26:33.239
...and drank a little more.

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:37.535
I promised my mother
I would help him get through it all.

01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:45.626
I caught up with him this one night.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:48.838
I was already haIf a dozen drinks behind.

01:26:50.506 --> 01:26:52.591
So we had a few more...

01:26:53.008 --> 01:26:56.178
...and after a while,
he tells me he wants to...

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:59.557
...drive me back to the apartment.

01:27:00.016 --> 01:27:02.060
I said ´´No, thanks.´"

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:06.689
We were all still living there, then.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:10.692
I just stood there and...

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:14.195
...watched him drive off.

01:27:18.034 --> 01:27:21.036
He makes it through
the whole goddamn war...

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:24.123
...and I let him drive.

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:30.378
Later that night, the nurse was typing...

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:33.925
...whatever it is they type...

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:37.094
...and you know what she tells me?

01:27:38.554 --> 01:27:41.514
She tells me how much
my book meant to her.

01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:46.145
My brother is getting cold
in the next room...

01:27:47.563 --> 01:27:50.358
...and all she can talk about is a book.

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:01.493
Within five months, I buried...

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:03.745
...him, my ma, my father.

01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:07.958
All of them here in the Bronx.

01:28:13.589 --> 01:28:15.882
We´d spend our summers here.

01:28:18.094 --> 01:28:20.512
And if we were lucky, the fall.

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.557
A lot of falls with those teams.

01:28:23.599 --> 01:28:25.267
Yeah, well...

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.311
...not enough.

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:32.190
´´The rest of those
who have gone before us...

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:35.444
´´...cannot steady the unrest of those...

01:28:36.112 --> 01:28:37.946
´´...to follow.´"

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:42.409
You wrote that in your book.

01:29:09.645 --> 01:29:13.357
I realise that if I give you enough time
you´ll find a way...

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.609
...to amaze even me.

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:20.823
Does he know?

01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:23.617
No, he doesn´t know.

01:29:23.659 --> 01:29:27.412
This was one of the best evenings l´ve had
in quite some time.

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:30.707
All of it?

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:32.459
Yes.

01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:34.168
All of it.

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.753
Well, I....

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.306
This guy....

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:50.434
How do you say you know this guy again?

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:52.855
-He´s my teacher.
-Yeah?

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.359
Seemed like a different kind of dude.

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:06.201
Anyone in particular?

01:30:07.703 --> 01:30:10.372
I sometimes come here in the morning.

01:30:11.207 --> 01:30:13.333
Just me, the aspiring...

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.628
...and all of them.

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:23.885
There was a note downstairs
saying I should come to see you.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.930
Mr. Wallace...

01:30:27.222 --> 01:30:31.893
...I think it´s time you and I had an honest
and open discussion about your writing.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.731
I thought you liked it.

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.567
Your recent work?

01:30:39.235 --> 01:30:41.236
I liked it very much.

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:45.074
No, the question concerning
your most recent work...

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:49.077
...isn´t whether it´s good...

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.622
...it´s whether it´s too good.

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:58.753
The acceleration in your progress from
your old school to this one is unusual...

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:03.257
...to the point that I must draw
one of two conclusions:

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.932
Either you´ve been blessed with
an uncommon gift, which has kicked in...

01:31:11.266 --> 01:31:12.726
...or...

01:31:14.269 --> 01:31:17.522
...you´re getting your inspiration
from elsewhere.

01:31:18.774 --> 01:31:22.110
Given your previous education
and your background...

01:31:22.277 --> 01:31:26.072
...l´m sure you´ll forgive me
for coming to my own conclusions.

01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:28.283
I wrote those papers.

01:31:28.283 --> 01:31:30.702
Then you won´t mind showing me.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:34.289
The next assignment´s due in two weeks.

01:31:34.289 --> 01:31:37.667
l´ll schedule some time for you
to come to my office.

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:41.921
l´d like to have you write it there.

01:31:44.299 --> 01:31:48.094
In the meantime, if there´s anything
you wish to talk about....

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:52.474
l´m not writing anything.

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:54.809
Which proves what?

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:59.314
If a two-comma kid wrote these papers,
he´d say, ´´Considering your background´´?

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:01.316
-Two-comma kid?
-$1,000,000.

01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:03.360
One comma, two commas.

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.445
No, I don´t.

01:32:06.321 --> 01:32:09.282
Do you know what
people are most afraid of?

01:32:09.823 --> 01:32:12.327
-What?
-What they don´t understand.

01:32:12.327 --> 01:32:15.705
When we don´t understand,
we turn to our assumptions.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.835
Crawford cannot understand...

01:32:19.835 --> 01:32:23.337
...how a black kid from the Bronx
can write the way you do.

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:25.465
So he assumes you can´t.

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.928
Just like I assume he´s an asshole.

01:32:30.846 --> 01:32:32.346
You knew him, didn´t you?

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:34.015
Crawford? No.

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:38.352
But he thought he knew me.

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:40.813
So what was that about his book?

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:44.025
A lot of writers
know the rules about writing...

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.361
...but they don´t know how to write.

01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:47.362
So?

01:32:47.362 --> 01:32:50.907
So Crawford wrote a book
about four authors who did know.

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.285
I was the only one still alive.

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.955
He convinced a publisher to buy it.

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.377
I made a polite telephone call...

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:05.963
...to this publisher, telling him and others...

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:09.884
...I was in the process
of writing a second book...

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:14.347
-...and if they wanted to bid on it--
-So that´s why Crawford´s book went away.

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.893
But you knew
there wouldn´t be a second book.

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.937
Yeah, but they didn´t.

01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:31.281
lnteresting what happens
when the resources aren´t close at hand.

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:15.491
The tradition of handing in composition
entries on the final day continues...

01:34:17.452 --> 01:34:19.120
...for yet...

01:34:19.454 --> 01:34:21.247
...another year.

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.546
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:34:28.962 --> 01:34:31.298
...may I have your attention?

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:33.677
Please, if you don´t mind.

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:37.972
´´Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:40.391
´´Death came with friendly care

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:43.185
´´The opening bud to heaven convey´d´"

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:45.729
How nice of you to join us.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.775
That´s not part of the poem.

01:34:49.484 --> 01:34:52.153
´´And bade it blossom there´´ Anyone?

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:58.701
A little more early morning reticence
than usual.

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:01.203
Mr. Coleridge.

01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:05.416
Please.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:11.130
How many students
would you say are here today?

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:15.175
l´m not sure.

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:18.345
Perhaps you could humour us with a guess.

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:21.933
Thirty?

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:25.853
And of that 30, not one person knows
the author of that passage.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.065
I find that remarkable, don´t you?

01:35:32.025 --> 01:35:34.528
Perhaps we should back into this.

01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:39.659
In looking at this, what, if any conclusions,
might we be able to draw?

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.746
You mean about the author?

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.790
About anything.

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:50.419
Do any of the words strike you as unusual?

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:58.302
Feel free to view this
as the appropriate time for a response.

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:02.515
´´Ere.´"

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.683
And why is that unusual?

01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:08.605
Because it sounds old.

01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:12.942
lt does sound old, doesn´t it?

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:15.444
Do you know why it sounds old?

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:20.074
Because it is old. More than 200 years old.

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:23.911
Written before your father was born,
before his father was born.

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.079
But...

01:36:26.079 --> 01:36:28.582
...that still does not excuse the fact
that you...

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:31.419
...don´t know who wrote it, now, does it?

01:36:34.087 --> 01:36:36.340
l´m sorry, sir, I don´t....

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:40.261
You, of all people here,
should know who wrote that passage.

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:43.680
And do you know why, Mr. Coleridge?

01:36:44.097 --> 01:36:46.308
I repeat, do you know why?

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:49.227
Just say your name, man.

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:53.775
Excuse me.
Did you have something to contribute?

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:59.113
I just said that he should say his name.

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:02.866
And why would it be helpful
for Mr. Coleridge to say his name?

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.910
Because that´s who wrote it.

01:37:06.119 --> 01:37:08.205
Very good, Mr. Wallace.

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:13.794
Perhaps your skills do extend
a bit farther than basketball.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:19.716
If we can turn to page--
You may be seated, Mr. Coleridge.

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:23.762
Turn to page 120
in the little blue book that--

01:37:24.638 --> 01:37:26.099
Further.

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.184
l´m sorry?

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.020
Don´t.

01:37:33.146 --> 01:37:36.984
You said my skills extend ´´farther´"
than the basketball court.

01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:39.611
´´Farther´´ relates to distance.

01:37:39.652 --> 01:37:42.365
´´Further´´ is a definition of degree.

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:44.658
You should have said ´´further.´"

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:46.744
Are you challenging me?

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:50.163
No more than you challenged Coleridge.

01:37:50.163 --> 01:37:53.750
Perhaps the challenge
should have been directed elsewhere.

01:37:55.668 --> 01:37:58.172
´´It is a melancholy truth that even--

01:37:58.172 --> 01:38:00.675
´´Great men have poor relations´"

01:38:00.675 --> 01:38:02.134
Dickens.

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:07.096
-´´You will hear the beat of--´"
-Kipling.

01:38:08.181 --> 01:38:10.851
-´´All great truths begin--´"
-Shaw.

01:38:11.184 --> 01:38:14.146
-´´Man is the only animal--
-´´That blushes

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:16.941
´´or needs to´"

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.278
Mark Twain.

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:24.155
-Come on, Professor--
-Get out!

01:38:25.698 --> 01:38:27.075
Get...

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.619
...out.

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:37.627
Yeah. l´ll get out.

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:53.226
-Leave it alone, Claire.
-Hold on, please.

01:38:53.226 --> 01:38:56.229
So around here,
they kick you out if you know something?

01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:58.231
You have no idea what Crawford could do.

01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:00.359
You´re right about that.

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:07.574
-Do you think you should apologise?
-No.

01:39:08.741 --> 01:39:10.452
-Do you?
-No.

01:39:11.244 --> 01:39:14.790
You did nothing wrong.
You just beat him at his own game.

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.625
But...

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:20.086
...it would be a good time to be careful.

01:39:20.253 --> 01:39:22.172
Careful about what?

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:27.844
You have a gift that should allow you
to do remarkable things in life.

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.764
That is, if you don´t screw it up...

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:33.392
...by being a 16-year-old right now.

01:39:44.777 --> 01:39:47.197
You got a call from the office.

01:39:54.287 --> 01:39:56.248
Mr. Wallace, please.

01:39:58.791 --> 01:40:00.293
As you know...

01:40:00.293 --> 01:40:05.006
...Professor Matthews is on Faculty Board.
Dr. Spence is chair of the Trustees Board.

01:40:05.298 --> 01:40:08.844
We´ve been reviewing the writing
competition submissions.

01:40:09.802 --> 01:40:13.974
We were hoping you might clarify
some points concerning your submission.

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:17.186
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:21.272
Your piece, correct?

01:40:22.315 --> 01:40:24.109
Yeah, that´s it.

01:40:24.317 --> 01:40:28.947
It is standard policy to ask students
if they wish to credit any source material...

01:40:30.323 --> 01:40:34.244
...or acknowledge any other writers
when turning in an assignment.

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.915
Do you wish to do that?

01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:44.670
1960.

01:40:46.839 --> 01:40:49.593
An essay titled Baseball´s Best Year...

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:54.222
...with a subtitle that reads:

01:40:54.347 --> 01:40:56.724
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

01:40:57.851 --> 01:41:00.895
Published in the New Yorker
and written by...

01:41:01.354 --> 01:41:03.356
...William Forrester.

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.863
Your version is quite original, but...

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:13.283
...there is the title
and first paragraph to consider.

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:16.493
lsn´t there?

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:23.001
Either you happen to have
William Forrester´s permission...

01:41:23.376 --> 01:41:24.878
...or....

01:41:25.378 --> 01:41:27.838
Have you some other explanation?

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.131
No.

01:41:31.384 --> 01:41:33.177
That´s my paper.

01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:38.392
Then your entry is now withdrawn and
this is a matter for the board to consider.

01:41:38.891 --> 01:41:43.021
The board does have the authority
to place you on academic probation...

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:48.276
...which would prevent you
from playing basketball in the future.

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:56.909
Since the board doesn´t meet
till next week...

01:41:56.909 --> 01:41:59.412
...you can play in this weekend´s
state championship.

01:41:59.412 --> 01:42:02.832
But the board has a history
of taking these matters...

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:06.337
...quite seriously.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.090
So we would like to suggest
what we feel is a...

01:42:10.423 --> 01:42:13.384
...solution that may satisfy these concerns.

01:42:14.927 --> 01:42:16.346
Robert.

01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:20.975
What matters most is to ensure
this type of violation isn´t repeated.

01:42:21.434 --> 01:42:22.770
So...

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:27.607
...you will be required to write an apology
to the students you took advantage of...

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:30.318
...by submitting this piece...

01:42:30.943 --> 01:42:33.446
...and you will read it in front of my class.

01:42:33.446 --> 01:42:34.947
l´m not reading anything.

01:42:34.947 --> 01:42:39.328
The board will consider that when deciding
whether to renew your scholarship.

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:42.830
You haven´t left us with too many options.

01:42:43.456 --> 01:42:45.000
Excuse me.

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:03.017
Don´t ever embarrass me
in front of my class.

01:43:07.979 --> 01:43:10.608
Return the pen when you´re finished.

01:43:18.491 --> 01:43:20.951
No conventional greetings today?

01:43:21.493 --> 01:43:24.498
Why have me rewrite something
you published?

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:25.498
Be careful.

01:43:25.498 --> 01:43:28.001
Why didn´t you tell me
some magazine ran it?

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:30.003
Why the hell should it matter?

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.129
You should have told me.

01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:35.508
What did you do with it?

01:43:35.508 --> 01:43:37.259
I turned it in.

01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:41.056
I turned it in.
I had to show them something.

01:43:41.514 --> 01:43:45.226
You promised me anything we wrote
in here would stay in here.

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:47.436
I know!

01:43:51.023 --> 01:43:53.316
-I just thought--
-Shut up.

01:43:59.031 --> 01:44:01.242
What are they telling you?

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:06.539
I go on probation unless I write a letter
saying I was wrong.

01:44:06.539 --> 01:44:08.541
Then write the letter.

01:44:08.541 --> 01:44:10.542
l´m not writing anything.

01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:13.463
You got him, he gets you. Write the letter.

01:44:15.047 --> 01:44:17.258
And you´d let him do that?

01:44:19.051 --> 01:44:21.762
ls this supposed to be another lesson?

01:44:22.054 --> 01:44:25.516
l´m tired of all these lessons.
Every time I come here.

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:32.064
The title of your essay is at the top
of my paper. What´s the lesson in that?

01:44:32.064 --> 01:44:33.566
l´m not the one who turned it in.

01:44:33.566 --> 01:44:36.569
You talked all that trash
when all you had to say was:

01:44:36.569 --> 01:44:40.364
´´Keep this one here
´cause it got printed in the New Yorker.´"

01:44:41.073 --> 01:44:43.284
That´s all you had to say.

01:44:45.077 --> 01:44:46.579
I could use a little help.

01:44:46.579 --> 01:44:48.747
No, that´s not an option.

01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:53.210
-You don´t even have to go--
-I said, that´s not an option.

01:44:53.586 --> 01:44:55.170
Sorry, man.

01:44:55.587 --> 01:44:57.589
l´m used to people not helping me.

01:44:57.589 --> 01:45:00.718
Oh, Christ.
Not that self-pity father bullshit.

01:45:02.595 --> 01:45:04.430
What did you say?

01:45:09.602 --> 01:45:11.686
Man, fuck you, William!

01:45:12.103 --> 01:45:15.108
The real bullshit
is you letting me take it on this one...

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:19.570
...´cause you´re scared to walk out the door
and do something for someone else.

01:45:22.114 --> 01:45:24.408
That´s the only damn reason.

01:45:25.618 --> 01:45:28.119
You don´t know a damn thing
about reasons.

01:45:28.119 --> 01:45:30.123
There are no reasons!

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:33.333
Reasons why some of us live
and some of us don´t.

01:45:33.625 --> 01:45:36.629
Fortunately for you,
you´ve decades to figure that out.

01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:41.049
What´s the reason for having a locked
cabinet of writing no one can ever read?

01:45:43.135 --> 01:45:45.012
What is that, man?

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.767
l´m done with this shit.

01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:01.362
Look, Jamal is here to pay us a visit.

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:07.701
What´s up?

01:46:09.161 --> 01:46:10.663
What´s up, y´all?

01:46:10.663 --> 01:46:12.123
Come on.

01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:43.195
How does your first game
in the Garden feel?

01:46:44.696 --> 01:46:47.115
A little closer than I thought.

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.370
That´s why I thought
it might be a good time for us to talk.

01:46:51.703 --> 01:46:56.375
I know it´s been hard handling classes with
the time you have to spend on the court.

01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:59.544
I couldn´t handle it, not at this school.

01:47:00.212 --> 01:47:03.298
Maybe it was unfair of us
to ask you to do it.

01:47:04.216 --> 01:47:07.386
I talked to the board members
and to Crawford...

01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.721
...and...

01:47:10.222 --> 01:47:13.600
...we don´t want to pursue this
any more than you do.

01:47:13.725 --> 01:47:17.771
So, l´m here to present you with an offer.
We forget the whole thing.

01:47:18.731 --> 01:47:22.234
Next year, your academic schedule
will be less demanding.

01:47:22.234 --> 01:47:23.736
Crawford wanted that?

01:47:23.736 --> 01:47:26.405
Crawford wants what´s best for you...

01:47:27.239 --> 01:47:28.740
...and for the school.

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.742
What am I supposed to do?

01:47:30.742 --> 01:47:34.247
You hold up a championship trophy
at the end of this tournament.

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:37.416
You make that happen,
l´ll make the rest happen.

01:47:38.751 --> 01:47:40.252
All right?

01:47:40.252 --> 01:47:42.963
Now, go finish up what you came to do.

01:47:49.761 --> 01:47:51.681
Let´s go, Pilgrims!

01:47:53.265 --> 01:47:55.434
Let´s go! Throw to Jamal!

01:48:24.296 --> 01:48:26.214
Damn, man. Come on.

01:48:27.299 --> 01:48:28.759
Defence!

01:48:41.814 --> 01:48:43.773
Jamal, get the ball!

01:49:01.833 --> 01:49:03.585
Good pass, man.

01:49:11.843 --> 01:49:13.428
Pick it up.

01:49:24.356 --> 01:49:26.525
Offensive foul! That way!

01:49:26.859 --> 01:49:29.235
10, Gold. Offensive! That way.

01:49:30.362 --> 01:49:32.614
You got them now. Let´s go.

01:49:45.376 --> 01:49:46.878
Time-out.

01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:52.592
This is still our game. We stop here,
they´lI have to put us on the line.

01:49:53.384 --> 01:49:57.055
When that happens, it´s all over.
Don´t lose your composure.

01:49:57.889 --> 01:50:02.310
If they score, we don´t call a time-out.
The ball goes to Hartwell or Wallace.

01:50:03.394 --> 01:50:06.022
Okay? Hartwell or Wallace. Let´s go.

01:50:07.898 --> 01:50:09.150
Go!

01:50:23.414 --> 01:50:25.249
What´s the score?

01:50:25.416 --> 01:50:27.628
lt ain´t looking good, Ma.

01:50:39.431 --> 01:50:41.640
Foul. 22, Blue. Two shots.

01:50:45.437 --> 01:50:48.606
Foul, Blue team, 22.
Hit, two. Go line up, guys.

01:50:57.449 --> 01:50:58.992
Two shots.

01:51:02.454 --> 01:51:04.455
We´re going to make these.

01:51:04.455 --> 01:51:07.459
-I can´t look.
-lt´s gonna be all right, Ma.

01:51:17.969 --> 01:51:19.345
Do it.

01:51:27.478 --> 01:51:28.814
Damn.

01:51:34.986 --> 01:51:36.487
One shot.

01:52:04.015 --> 01:52:05.641
That´s game.

01:54:56.563 --> 01:54:59.648
Thank God.
He must have come in after we left.

01:55:00.566 --> 01:55:02.068
Let him sleep.

01:55:02.068 --> 01:55:05.362
-l´ll turn the light off.
-Turn it off and come on.

01:55:12.078 --> 01:55:14.913
You started cleaning up your room, Jamal.

01:55:30.096 --> 01:55:33.182
He looks very happy with himself,
that coyote.

01:55:51.617 --> 01:55:53.952
Jamal, he wrote that for you.

01:55:55.621 --> 01:55:56.956
When?

01:55:57.123 --> 01:55:58.874
After the game.

01:55:59.124 --> 01:56:02.044
He´s going back to the school this morning.

01:56:03.129 --> 01:56:04.629
lt´s funny, though.

01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:07.299
They always let you get but so far...

01:56:07.633 --> 01:56:10.511
...before taking everything away from you.

01:56:11.136 --> 01:56:15.265
God, he´s such a good kid, man.
Then he gets to come back to this shit.

01:56:57.183 --> 01:56:59.060
ls that seat open?

01:57:01.186 --> 01:57:02.771
I think so.

01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:06.983
This isn´t where I thought l´d find you.

01:57:09.194 --> 01:57:11.195
lt´s still my school.

01:57:12.196 --> 01:57:15.493
They want me out,
they´lI have to do it themselves.

01:57:15.701 --> 01:57:17.244
They will.

01:57:18.203 --> 01:57:19.705
Whatever.

01:57:32.718 --> 01:57:37.139
´´The winter´s darkness and cold is but
a momentary prelude to the new spring.

01:57:37.723 --> 01:57:41.768
´´And while its grip seems endless
our own perseverance proves equal.

01:57:42.727 --> 01:57:44.230
´´We renew ourselves once again...

01:57:44.230 --> 01:57:47.649
´´...seeking out the bright moments
that will serve...

01:57:48.233 --> 01:57:50.777
´´...that will serve therefore....

01:57:52.737 --> 01:57:56.073
´´Therefore serve
as the foundation of our future.´"

01:57:57.742 --> 01:57:59.285
Thank you.

01:58:09.254 --> 01:58:11.173
Professor Crawford.

01:58:14.258 --> 01:58:16.345
May I read a few words?

01:58:21.767 --> 01:58:23.810
What is he doing here?

01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:27.606
Yes, of course, by all means.

01:58:30.776 --> 01:58:32.778
Thank you, Professor.

01:58:46.792 --> 01:58:49.128
My name is William Forrester.

01:58:55.801 --> 01:58:57.343
Excuse me.

01:59:02.807 --> 01:59:04.476
l´m that one.

01:59:08.813 --> 01:59:10.523
Losing Family.

01:59:12.317 --> 01:59:15.403
´´Losing family obliges us
to find our family.

01:59:18.324 --> 01:59:21.284
´´Not always the family that is our blood...

01:59:21.326 --> 01:59:24.413
´´...but the family
that can become our blood.

01:59:25.329 --> 01:59:29.250
´´Should we have the wisdom
to open our door to this new family...

01:59:30.335 --> 01:59:34.757
´´...we will find that the wishes we had
for the father, who once guided us...

01:59:36.341 --> 01:59:39.386
´´...for the brother, who once inspired us....

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:18.549
´´The only thing left to say will be:

02:00:18.883 --> 02:00:22.971
´´´I wish I had seen this,
or I wish I had done that, or I wish....´´"

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:28.685
Most of you are too young...

02:00:29.894 --> 02:00:32.521
...to know what your wishes will be.

02:00:32.897 --> 02:00:35.274
But when I read these words...

02:00:36.402 --> 02:00:38.653
...words of hope, dreams...

02:00:40.905 --> 02:00:43.199
...I realise that the one...

02:00:43.407 --> 02:00:46.661
...wish that was granted to me,
so late in life...

02:00:47.912 --> 02:00:50.289
...was the gift of friendship.

02:00:53.919 --> 02:00:58.632
Mr. Forrester, l´m sure I speak on behalf
of everyone in thanking you for this visit.

02:01:00.925 --> 02:01:02.426
The quality...

02:01:02.426 --> 02:01:04.345
...of your words...

02:01:04.929 --> 02:01:08.016
...is something we should
all aspire to reach.

02:01:14.439 --> 02:01:17.233
May I ask to what do we owe this honour?

02:01:18.943 --> 02:01:20.945
Professor Crawford...

02:01:21.946 --> 02:01:25.825
...I spoke here today
because a friend of mine wasn´t allowed to.

02:01:27.452 --> 02:01:30.580
A friend who had
the integrity to protect me...

02:01:31.456 --> 02:01:34.208
...when I was unwilling to protect him.

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.170
His name is Jamal Wallace.

02:01:43.969 --> 02:01:46.470
Jamal Wallace is a friend of yours?

02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:48.055
Yes, he is.

02:01:50.474 --> 02:01:54.229
I helped him find his own words
by starting with some of mine.

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.649
In return, he promised...

02:01:58.983 --> 02:02:01.527
...never to say anything about me.

02:02:03.988 --> 02:02:06.115
A promise which he kept.

02:02:08.492 --> 02:02:12.371
While your visit seems heartfelt,
l´m sure you will appreciate...

02:02:12.997 --> 02:02:15.667
...it will not change or interfere...

02:02:16.501 --> 02:02:20.755
...with this institution reaching a fair
and proper decision in this case.

02:02:21.005 --> 02:02:23.299
There´s one more issue here.

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:27.971
Those words that I read today...

02:02:30.014 --> 02:02:32.016
...I didn´t write them.

02:02:32.016 --> 02:02:33.893
Jamal Wallace did.

02:02:44.028 --> 02:02:45.405
Quiet.

02:02:48.532 --> 02:02:50.243
Quiet, please.

02:02:51.035 --> 02:02:52.536
Be still.

02:02:55.039 --> 02:02:56.750
Quiet, please.

02:02:57.541 --> 02:02:59.585
That has no bearing...

02:03:00.044 --> 02:03:02.547
...on the decision concerning Mr.--

02:03:02.547 --> 02:03:06.050
As director of this competition,
I have final say in this matter.

02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:07.885
Robert, sit down.

02:03:08.052 --> 02:03:11.096
I have been a teacher
for more than 30 years.

02:03:11.555 --> 02:03:15.351
That´s long enough to know
that integrity counts for something.

02:03:15.559 --> 02:03:18.521
l´d say that Mr. Forrester has cleared up...

02:03:19.063 --> 02:03:20.564
...this matter...

02:03:20.564 --> 02:03:24.652
...very nicely for us all.
As chairman of the Faculty Board, I have...

02:03:25.068 --> 02:03:27.529
...the last word in that matter.

02:03:28.072 --> 02:03:31.075
You are excused
from next week´s board meeting.

02:03:31.075 --> 02:03:32.868
Mr. Forrester...

02:03:34.078 --> 02:03:37.706
...should you ever be interested
in a teaching position....

02:03:38.082 --> 02:03:39.333
No.

02:03:41.585 --> 02:03:43.880
Jamal, these are your words?

02:03:47.092 --> 02:03:48.551
Sixteen.

02:03:50.094 --> 02:03:51.679
Remarkable.

02:04:19.123 --> 02:04:22.668
l´m thinking you´ll make
your own decisions from here on.

02:04:24.128 --> 02:04:27.589
I thought you´d say something like,
´´l always could.´´

02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:31.094
No more lessons.
I have a question, though.

02:04:32.636 --> 02:04:35.723
Those two foul shots
at the end of the game...

02:04:36.641 --> 02:04:39.518
...did you miss them or did you miss them?

02:04:41.145 --> 02:04:43.730
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

02:04:45.649 --> 02:04:47.151
Let´s go.

02:04:49.653 --> 02:04:53.783
Do you think our vaudeville act today
will merit the National Enquirer?

02:04:54.158 --> 02:04:55.742
Definitely.

02:04:57.661 --> 02:04:59.871
Whatever happens, l´m off.

02:05:02.166 --> 02:05:05.669
What´s the word
you and your friends would use for that?

02:05:06.169 --> 02:05:07.629
Leaving?

02:05:08.172 --> 02:05:09.632
Oh, God.

02:05:10.174 --> 02:05:11.675
Where are you off to?

02:05:11.675 --> 02:05:14.761
I have a homeland
I haven´t seen for too long.

02:05:15.179 --> 02:05:17.013
You mean lreland.

02:05:17.181 --> 02:05:19.183
Scotland, for God´s sake.

02:05:19.183 --> 02:05:21.394
l´m messin´ with you, man.

02:05:23.186 --> 02:05:25.022
Be sure to write.

02:06:01.724 --> 02:06:03.226
What´s up, John?

02:06:03.226 --> 02:06:05.229
You heard from William?

02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:09.900
Yeah, but I don´t know what he´s doing.
He just checks up on the college recruiters.

02:06:11.235 --> 02:06:14.237
I was just downstairs.
Looks like you got another one.

02:06:14.237 --> 02:06:15.572
Word?

02:06:16.239 --> 02:06:17.990
See you around.

02:06:24.748 --> 02:06:27.459
-Steve Sanderson.
-How are you doing?

02:06:27.751 --> 02:06:29.752
Thanks for coming down on short notice.

02:06:29.752 --> 02:06:31.338
No problem.

02:06:31.755 --> 02:06:33.256
What school are you from?

02:06:33.256 --> 02:06:36.385
No. l´m a lawyer.
I work with Roberts & Carter.

02:06:38.262 --> 02:06:39.263
-A lawyer.
-Yeah.

02:06:39.263 --> 02:06:42.224
But congratulations on all that. lt´s great.

02:06:44.268 --> 02:06:47.437
A bunch of guys in the office
are following you.

02:06:49.272 --> 02:06:52.651
We´re the legal representation
for William Forrester.

02:06:54.278 --> 02:06:55.821
How is he?

02:06:56.781 --> 02:06:58.281
Sit down.

02:07:04.787 --> 02:07:07.834
We´ve received word
that William passed away.

02:07:19.303 --> 02:07:20.845
l´m sorry.

02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:29.438
He wanted you to have...

02:07:29.813 --> 02:07:32.065
...these things right away.

02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:49.040
What happened?

02:07:50.333 --> 02:07:52.252
William had cancer.

02:07:54.338 --> 02:07:56.965
They found it a couple of years ago.

02:08:07.851 --> 02:08:09.853
Jamal, this is crazy.

02:08:10.353 --> 02:08:11.938
Oh, my God.

02:08:16.359 --> 02:08:18.486
Look at all these books.

02:08:18.862 --> 02:08:20.863
Don´t touch anything.

02:09:39.441 --> 02:09:40.943
Dear Jamal..

02:09:40.943 --> 02:09:44.448
Someone I once knew wrote
that we walk away from our dreams...

02:09:44.448 --> 02:09:48.285
...afraid that we may fail, or worse yet,
afraid we may succeed.

02:09:49.953 --> 02:09:53.915
While I knew so very early on
that you would realise your dreams...

02:09:54.457 --> 02:09:57.877
...I never imagined
I would once again realise my own.

02:09:59.463 --> 02:10:00.964
Seasons change, young man.

02:10:00.964 --> 02:10:05.552
While I waited until the winter of my life
to see what I´ve seen this past year...

02:10:06.969 --> 02:10:11.265
...there is no doubt I would have
waited too long, had it not been for you.

02:10:21.484 --> 02:10:23.861
You gonna be here awhile, man?

02:10:27.490 --> 02:10:29.491
Just can´t watch the eyes this time.

02:10:29.491 --> 02:10:31.828
You´ll be okay, man. Come on.

02:10:34.997 --> 02:10:36.666
Come on, man.

02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.918
Get up.
