01:11.321 --> 01:13.323
[electronic beeping]

01:14.449 --> 01:16.118
All right, guys, we're ready to fire.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.120
Be careful, you've only got one shot.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.581
Don't worry, Pidge, I'm an excellent shot.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.250
-You are?
-Yes! That's my thing!

01:23.333 --> 01:25.794
-Since when?
-Just get ready.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.304
[breathing heavily]

01:54.406 --> 01:55.657
[screaming]

01:55.741 --> 01:56.658
Pidge!

01:56.742 --> 01:57.743
[grunting]

01:57.826 --> 01:59.620
-[clanging]
-[grunts]

02:02.289 --> 02:03.790
Nice catch.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.044
[Pidge]
This seems like an awfully large place

02:08.127 --> 02:10.213
to hold only one prisoner.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.590
[Shiro]
Let's hope this Slav guy

02:11.673 --> 02:14.134
is as good
as the Blade of Marmora said he is.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.990
[whirring]

02:40.452 --> 02:43.538
Beginning phase two of the plan.
I'm blocking the sensors.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.083
Lance, you've only got four doboshes
to scan the base

02:46.166 --> 02:48.210
and land your lion
before they're back online.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.920
<i>Copy that.</i>

02:53.882 --> 02:54.925
[beeping]

02:58.011 --> 03:00.305
[Lance]
<i>Initializing sonic scan now.</i>

03:00.389 --> 03:01.598
[grunts]

03:02.641 --> 03:04.393
[roars]

03:17.572 --> 03:19.574
Sonic scan complete. Uploading the data.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.954
Perfect. We're right on top
of your entry point.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.665
Get to my location.
Hurry, you've got 60 ticks.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.667
<i>On my way.</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.147
[Shiro]
Okay, phase two complete.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.315
Welcome to Beta Traz.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.412
More! Give me more!

04:05.495 --> 04:08.123
[grunting]

04:08.206 --> 04:09.249
[groans]

04:09.332 --> 04:11.918
Why have you stopped?

04:12.002 --> 04:14.337
My Lord, Haggar ordered us
to limit your--

04:14.421 --> 04:15.338
[screams]

04:16.380 --> 04:17.466
[groans]

04:19.176 --> 04:24.222
Remember who your master is.
Now, give me more!

04:32.731 --> 04:35.358
I've compiled the data
from the Blue Lion's sonic scan

04:35.442 --> 04:36.735
and created this map.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.489
It appears the prison is comprised
of three concentric levels.

04:40.572 --> 04:45.035
Each level is showing
different types of security. That's weird.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.413
The Blade of Marmora said
this prison was made just for Slav,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.582
but I'm showing two cells.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.125
Who else would be held here?

04:52.209 --> 04:55.170
I'm guessing a space ninja.
Or maybe someone with magical powers?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.880
You know, just spit-balling here.
I don't know.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.049
Let's just keep tossing out ideas.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.930
-Can you get a visual on the cells?
-No, not from here.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.432
And even if I could,
we don't know what Slav looks like.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.434
Then we're just going
to have to check both.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.186
Dibs on the closer one!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.022
What? My legs are tired.

05:14.105 --> 05:18.527
[sighs] I'll go to the command center
to try and access the security system.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.612
Let's get moving.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.617
[screaming]

05:25.700 --> 05:30.455
[screaming continues, intensifies]

05:30.539 --> 05:35.585
Already, your mind is rendering me
weapons and genetic modifications.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.089
-[panting, screaming]
-It must be eating you up.

05:39.172 --> 05:44.010
Your brain turned against you
and those who would oppose Zarkon.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.346
-[screaming continues]
-[machine whirring, hissing]

05:46.429 --> 05:47.806
[sobbing]

05:47.889 --> 05:49.057
Ow!

05:49.140 --> 05:50.559
[screaming]

05:50.642 --> 05:52.644
-That's enough for one day.
-[sighs]

05:52.727 --> 05:57.524
You're not the only one
that needs my special attention.

05:59.276 --> 06:04.364
With your mind,
the Galra Empire will be unstoppable.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.512
-[Pidge] <i>I'm in.</i>
-Guide us through.

06:27.596 --> 06:31.182
It looks like the top level
is patrolled by the sentries.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.769
The second level is patrolled
by floating drones.

06:34.853 --> 06:38.023
-Oh, wow, that's interesting.
-Good interesting?

06:38.106 --> 06:41.026
The second level
also has immobilizing foam.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.279
-Oh, so bad interesting.
-And the third level?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.906
Closed system. I can't get in from here.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.992
[Shiro]
<i>You can't get in from the command center?</i>

06:49.075 --> 06:51.953
No single location can access
the entire prison.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.496
<i>It's a security measure.</i>

06:53.580 --> 06:56.625
<i>When you reach that level,</i>
<i>you'll have to link me in.</i>

06:56.708 --> 06:58.376
We're on our way down.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.755
Okay.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.590
[to herself]
While you do that...

07:05.675 --> 07:07.260
I'll find you, Matt.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.184
How are we going to get by this guy?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
Good teamwork on that one.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.986
Uh-oh, we're spotted.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.988
No, no, no, that's mine!

07:27.072 --> 07:29.366
He's going to be your escort
through this hallway.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.742
He'll scramble the monitors.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.413
<i>Shiro, you go left. Lance, go right.</i>

07:35.497 --> 07:37.082
[Shiro]
Affirmative.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.918
Okay, open the panel next to you.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.797
<i>Connect your gauntlet so I can hack in.</i>

07:46.383 --> 07:47.717
[dings]

07:48.343 --> 07:51.471
Now, I have access to level three.
Opening the entrances.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.561
Huh?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.817
Pidge, you have any idea how
I'm gonna get through these giant doors?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.902
Lance, be quiet. Someone's coming.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.613
[panting, grunting]

08:13.785 --> 08:16.663
Okay, but seriously,
those are some heavy-duty doors.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.592
Don't play innocent. I know what you did.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.094
[suspenseful music playing]

08:32.595 --> 08:35.056
All right, I made it to the cell.
Open the doors, Pidge.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.890
Uh, I can't from here.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.934
The door over here
scanned that guy's face.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.980
Oh, facial recognition. Shiro, hold tight.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.441
Lance, you're gonna need
to get a scan of his face.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.237
[growling]

08:49.320 --> 08:51.906
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

09:05.462 --> 09:07.505
[inhales deeply, sighs]

09:07.589 --> 09:08.673
Face on the way, Pidge.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.469
Creating 3D render.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.887
Sending to you.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.486
Are you Slav?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.405
Are you here to torture me?

09:32.489 --> 09:35.825
No, I'm here to save you.
I'm a Paladin of Voltron.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.786
Oh, no, even worse.

09:37.869 --> 09:43.333
In 98 and 3/100ths of a percent
of realities with a prison break, I die!

09:43.416 --> 09:46.336
And your chances are even worse!

09:46.419 --> 09:47.587
[rumbling]

09:52.258 --> 09:54.135
[grunting]

09:54.928 --> 09:57.472
Mm-hm. Mm... hm.

09:57.555 --> 10:02.227
[crunching, growling]

10:03.353 --> 10:04.979
[shrieks]
Are you--?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.482
[clears throat]
 Are you Slav?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.984
[suspenseful music playing]

10:10.068 --> 10:11.569
Yup.

10:11.653 --> 10:15.573
Don't worry, Slav. I'm here to rescue you.
I'm with Voltron. Do you know Voltron?

10:15.657 --> 10:16.658
Yup.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.244
Great. Then you know
what the Blue Lion is.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.578
Yup.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.039
-Pidge, I've got Slav.
-Pidge, I've got Slav.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.416
-What?
-I said I have Slav.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.210
No, I have Slav. Wait, hold on.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.255
-Tell me the truth. Are you Slav?
-Yup.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.090
We don't have time for this.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.759
You're just gonna have to bring
both of them back.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
Okay. Give us the route out of here.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.560
-Yeah, we're ready to go, too.
-Yup.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.147
-[Lance] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Shiro] <i>Pidge!</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:01.536
[Shiro]
<i>Lance, looks like we're on our own.</i>

11:01.619 --> 11:02.912
<i>We've gotta get back to Pidge.</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.081
Wait, what?
I have no idea where I'm going.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.917
-Slav, do you know how to get back?
-Yup.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.962
What am I talking about?
Of course, you do. You're a genius.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.465
-Come on. We've got to hurry.
-No, thanks.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.802
What? We're finally going to stop Zarkon.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.513
We have the Olkari
and the Blade of Marmora on our side.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.099
But, without you, we can't do it.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.226
Mm.

11:25.310 --> 11:29.063
I can have you on the Blue Lion
and gone in no time, but we must hurry!

11:29.147 --> 11:32.734
Oh, the Blue Lion. Why didn't you say so?

11:32.817 --> 11:37.780
Blue light has a frequency
between 606 to 608 terahertz.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.950
Is that gonna jam their scanners
or something?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.828
No, that's just my lucky range
of terahertz.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.496
Let's go!

11:48.249 --> 11:51.085
[to himself]
Okay, uh, more to the left. Mm...

11:51.169 --> 11:53.463
This needs to be right. Um...

11:53.546 --> 11:55.757
Oh, but not too right.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.133
-Oh, come on!
-[yelps]

11:57.216 --> 12:01.304
Oh! Now, I gotta start over.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.142
Sir, Laika has escaped.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.102
Oh, no!

12:09.938 --> 12:11.731
Guard this station.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.901
Come on, get outta here.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.030
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

12:19.113 --> 12:20.573
Yup.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.411
[growls]

12:28.164 --> 12:30.541
-[growling]
-Whoa! You're really savage!

12:30.625 --> 12:32.627
No wonder the Marmorites think
you're so awesome.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.629
That's what I'm calling
the Blade of Marmora. "Marmorites."

12:34.712 --> 12:36.547
-[chuckles] That sound good?
-Yup.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.008
-Great minds.
-Yup.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.305
Perfect!

12:44.389 --> 12:46.557
Okay, now, there's a two percent chance

12:46.641 --> 12:49.769
this mission won't result
in a horrific, deadly fireball.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.312
Let's leave!

12:51.396 --> 12:53.272
-[panting]
-[screams]

12:54.482 --> 12:56.025
-Let's go back!
-[growls]

12:56.109 --> 13:00.238
-Just take the blanket with you.
-What? No, the blanket's perfect.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.906
Don't touch the blanket!

13:01.990 --> 13:03.574
It's that!

13:03.658 --> 13:04.909
[screams]

13:04.993 --> 13:07.120
That's a tiny puddle. You'll be fine.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.955
There's a 12 percent chance I could slip.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.582
There are even realities in which I drown

13:11.666 --> 13:14.961
because, in those realities,
I never learned to swim!

13:15.044 --> 13:18.047
What about this reality?
Did you learn to swim in this one?

13:18.131 --> 13:21.050
I can't remember!
There are infinite possibilities!

13:21.134 --> 13:22.802
It's a tiny puddle!

13:22.885 --> 13:26.347
I can already feel myself
not being able to breathe.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.182
My lungs are filling with water.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.188
How did you escape?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.816
I'll find you, my pet.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.403
Pidge is the hacker of our group.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.947
-Shiro's our awesome leader.
-Yup.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.073
Hunk's our mechanic.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.118
He's also a chef and just
a pretty cool dude to hang out with.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.036
Yup.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.538
And Keith is always doing things
like flying into asteroid fields

13:50.621 --> 13:52.290
and black holes and cool junk like that.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.207
Yup.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.084
And I thought
I was the team's sharpshooter,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.795
but I guess no one else thinks that.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.382
Maybe I don't have a thing.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.592
Yup.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.844
You don't have to agree
with me so quickly.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.555
They wouldn't keep me on the team
if I didn't contribute in some way,

14:07.638 --> 14:08.473
would they?

14:08.556 --> 14:11.142
-Yup.
-Maybe you're right.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.604
Maybe I'm just a fifth wheel.
Seventh if you count Coran and Allura.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.939
That's a horrible wheel to be.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.858
Yup.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.487
You're so strong. Must be that robot arm.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.365
But doesn't it bother you
that you only have one?

14:25.448 --> 14:27.450
-[screams]
-Oh, what? What?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.787
Look at all those cracks!
I can't step on those.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.413
I was carrying you!

14:32.497 --> 14:36.918
Oh, I guess no one cares
about their mothers' backs anymore!

14:37.001 --> 14:39.504
Wait, you know that nursery rhyme?

14:39.587 --> 14:44.050
Nursery rhyme?
I'm talking about quantum realities here.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.719
Cracks initiate space-time
temporal fissures,

14:46.803 --> 14:50.807
which mathematically make higher
probabilities for alternate realities

14:50.890 --> 14:53.810
in which your mother has a broken back.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.896
[sighs]

14:57.105 --> 15:00.983
Is there a different route we can take?
One without cracks?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.611
Well, sure,
we could go out the scree duct,

15:03.694 --> 15:05.405
but, you know, it's all full of scree.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.489
Ugh!

15:06.572 --> 15:10.868
There's the vlaxenator, but you can hear
the water dripping in there.

15:10.952 --> 15:14.997
-And you're worried about drowning.
-Now, you're getting it!

15:15.081 --> 15:18.459
[Shiro] <i>Pidge, are you there?</i>
<i>We need an alternate route.</i>

15:18.543 --> 15:19.752
<i>Pidge?</i>

15:24.507 --> 15:26.134
Okay, sorry about that. I'm back.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.844
I'll find you a new route, Shiro.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.222
-Yeah, can you tell me where I am?
-Just a sec. Pulling it up now.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.642
[suspenseful music playing]

15:37.728 --> 15:39.397
[suspenseful music playing]

15:39.480 --> 15:42.442
How about I cover your eyes
and carry you across?

15:42.525 --> 15:45.570
-I'll know.
-[growls] Let's just give it a try.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.238
[whimpering]

15:47.321 --> 15:48.739
[Slav screams]

15:53.870 --> 15:55.163
No screaming!

15:55.246 --> 15:56.789
I was screaming?

15:57.748 --> 16:00.001
Uh, I don't see an alternate route, Shiro.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.794
-[rapid beeping]
-[gasps]

16:01.878 --> 16:05.256
-Lance, look out!
-Quick, somebody's coming.

16:06.966 --> 16:07.967
What are you doing?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.137
-Are you trying to get us caught?
-Yup.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.266
I've found you.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.400
Stay away from my friend!

16:25.318 --> 16:29.030
There's your kidnapper.
Put the prison on lockdown!

16:29.113 --> 16:31.240
[alarm blaring]

16:32.950 --> 16:34.160
Huh?

16:35.244 --> 16:38.456
-[grunting]
-[Lance screaming]

16:45.922 --> 16:48.257
Pidge, you've gotta shut off
this foam for me!

16:48.341 --> 16:49.467
On it!

16:49.550 --> 16:50.843
Huh?

17:01.604 --> 17:03.439
Matt?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.273
-[Lance] <i>Pidge!</i>
-[yelps] Sorry!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.276
Just reversing
the targeting system, and...

17:08.109 --> 17:09.779
-[giggling on computer]
-This ought to slow him down.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.284
[grunting]

17:15.367 --> 17:16.618
What? No!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.412
Stick around!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.748
Huh? Huh?

17:21.499 --> 17:22.625
-[doors opening]
-Huh?

17:24.627 --> 17:25.795
Uh-oh.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.297
[groans]
Come back here!

17:28.381 --> 17:32.343
Find out where they're headed!
Lock down all exits!

17:32.426 --> 17:35.555
-We've got to go!
-[screaming]

17:35.638 --> 17:39.183
[growls] My friends are in trouble.
We have to go now!

17:39.267 --> 17:42.061
We are walking over those cracks.
It's our only option.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.147
Why don't we just turn the gravity off
and float over them instead?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.526
Honestly, that's our best shot
of getting out of here in one piece.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.902
I ran the numbers.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.321
Pidge, any chance
you can turn the gravity off?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.240
Oh, that's a great idea!

17:54.323 --> 17:57.326
Then the sentries won't be able
to maneuver, but we have our jetpacks.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.452
It's genius!

17:59.245 --> 18:00.871
[whirring]

18:11.090 --> 18:12.550
[grunting]

18:13.884 --> 18:14.885
[grunting]

18:18.514 --> 18:22.476
That robot arm is fantastic!
Now, imagine if you had two.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.396
Our chances of survival
would go up 300 percent

18:25.479 --> 18:28.024
from totally doomed to highly unlikely.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.449
Oh, wow, you have Laika.
The warden will not be happy about that.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.660
-Who's Laika?
-She's the warden's pet yupper.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.705
-Wait, what? [gasps] You're an animal?
-Yup.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.958
Oh, I see where the confusion was for you.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.422
Gravity's back online in three, two, one.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.596
I'm headed for the hangar.

19:00.014 --> 19:00.848
[all]
Uh...

19:02.850 --> 19:04.810
-[screaming]
-Get to the lion!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.103
[screaming]

19:17.114 --> 19:18.658
[grunts]

19:18.741 --> 19:19.784
I had him!

19:20.451 --> 19:22.328
Let's go. Slav!

19:22.411 --> 19:24.205
Be right with you!

19:24.288 --> 19:26.624
-Slav!
-[screaming]

19:26.707 --> 19:27.958
[grunts]

19:31.796 --> 19:35.257
You steal my yupper and my prisoner?

19:39.804 --> 19:40.805
[grunting]

19:45.601 --> 19:48.187
Okay, I'm ready-- What is that?

19:49.397 --> 19:53.317
You're not going anywhere.
And neither is the lion.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.111
-[both scream]
-[growling]

19:55.194 --> 19:56.821
[both scream]

19:56.904 --> 19:58.322
[panting]

19:58.406 --> 19:59.573
[grunts]

19:59.657 --> 20:01.033
[groans]

20:01.117 --> 20:03.911
See what I was saying
about those robot arms?

20:03.994 --> 20:06.706
[grunting]

20:12.294 --> 20:13.546
[grunts, screams]

20:13.629 --> 20:14.922
Lance! No!

20:16.507 --> 20:18.300
[screaming]

20:18.384 --> 20:19.760
[groaning]

20:19.844 --> 20:22.596
[grunting]

20:24.515 --> 20:27.268
-[groaning]
-[grunting, yelling]

20:30.187 --> 20:32.356
[grunting]

20:32.440 --> 20:33.733
-[screams]
-[grunting]

20:33.816 --> 20:35.025
[both screaming]

20:35.109 --> 20:36.986
[gasps, grunts]

20:37.069 --> 20:39.363
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps]

20:44.660 --> 20:46.662
[grunting]

20:46.746 --> 20:48.581
[all grunting]

20:51.250 --> 20:55.379
[grunting]

21:02.094 --> 21:05.931
[screaming]

21:08.642 --> 21:10.644
[screaming]

21:10.728 --> 21:12.980
-No!
-Wait, I got this.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.065
Come on...

21:15.149 --> 21:17.943
[takes deep breath]

21:20.488 --> 21:22.573
[screaming]

21:23.199 --> 21:25.910
-[screams]
-[screaming]

21:28.162 --> 21:30.706
[screaming]

21:30.790 --> 21:33.834
Nice, Lance!
That's why we bring our sharpshooter.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.085
Yup.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.842
At least, <i>you're</i> okay.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.137
That's a good girl. Yes, you are.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.973
Who's a good little yupper?
Who's the good little yupper?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.145
[Lance groans]

21:53.229 --> 21:57.399
The information I found on my brother
says he was taken by a group of rebels.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.568
He's still out there.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.613
Matt's a lot like you. He's a survivor.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.240
We'll find him.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.578
[groans]

22:16.961 --> 22:18.629
[groaning]

22:21.382 --> 22:24.468
[Haggar] Sire, I believe
there's a spy in our ranks.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.346
Our communications may be compromised.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.973
None of that matters.

22:29.056 --> 22:33.435
Once the Black Lion is recaptured,
no one will stand against me.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.355
Have you made any further progress
with my armor?

22:36.438 --> 22:41.193
None of the tests have been successful.
Each time, the subject was killed.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.987
I need it ready.

22:43.070 --> 22:49.034
If your beasts will not defeat Voltron
for me, I will do it myself.
