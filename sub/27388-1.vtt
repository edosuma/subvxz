00:38.346 --> 00:42.558
ANA AND BRUNO

00:49.357 --> 00:51.442
And what color is the sky?

00:51.484 --> 00:53.069
It's blue.

00:53.736 --> 00:55.700
Blue. Blue like the...?

00:55.725 --> 00:56.893
The sea.

01:02.662 --> 01:07.124
Ana, you see that cloud?
What does it look like?

01:07.416 --> 01:10.878
It looks like... a dragon.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.132
Look Mommy, a crow!

01:15.549 --> 01:17.968
And he's brought friends along
with him, you see that?

01:41.575 --> 01:43.911
The train, the train!

01:45.621 --> 01:47.998
Are we there, are we there yet, Mommy?

01:48.480 --> 01:49.898
Almost sweetie.

01:50.830 --> 01:54.088
Can I please go inside with you
Mommy, please Mommy?

01:54.130 --> 01:55.589
Of course I will.

01:56.799 --> 01:58.968
Where is it? I want to see it.

01:59.301 --> 02:01.053
We're almost there.

02:07.977 --> 02:11.188
- Look, Mommy, it's a seagull!
- Oh it is.

02:12.314 --> 02:14.859
Can you imagine flying like that?

02:19.530 --> 02:21.699
The sea! The sea!

02:25.809 --> 02:29.232
Look Mommy it's a doggy.  It's so cute
right Mommy?

02:36.547 --> 02:38.799
Hello. What's your name, huh?

02:40.134 --> 02:41.510
Oh yeah?

02:41.761 --> 02:43.596
He says his name is Crash Mommy.

02:43.637 --> 02:44.680
- Crash?
- Uh huh.

02:45.321 --> 02:47.239
I'm going to see the water Mommy.

02:47.391 --> 02:48.768
Don't stray too far away dear.

02:49.393 --> 02:52.284
Welcome. Did you have a nice trip?

02:52.378 --> 02:54.190
You shouldn't get so close Ana.

02:54.231 --> 02:57.067
It's so big. Whoa.

03:06.412 --> 03:11.667
I'll be back in a few days.
Try and get some rest, alright?

03:13.164 --> 03:14.430
Uh huh.

03:28.015 --> 03:28.772
Ana!

03:28.797 --> 03:30.424
Coming Mommy.

03:32.770 --> 03:34.438
Daddy's about to leave.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.690
It's the best place ever Mommy!

03:37.650 --> 03:40.799
Ana, you got yourself all soaked.

03:40.843 --> 03:42.344
He's leaving?

03:46.830 --> 03:49.458
Wait Dad, come look at this.

03:49.901 --> 03:51.903
Daddy, Daddy!

03:53.374 --> 03:54.792
Daddy!

03:55.269 --> 03:56.812
Daddy!

03:56.931 --> 03:58.475
Ana!

04:11.100 --> 04:12.906
He didn't want to stop.

04:12.931 --> 04:15.362
You know how much he hates goodbyes.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.760
I don't really like goodbyes either Mommy.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.343
Daddy has a lot
of work in San Marcos.

04:22.934 --> 04:24.936
But he'll be back very soon.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.142
But Mommy when though?

04:27.223 --> 04:29.016
Very soon darling.

04:37.251 --> 04:39.461
Look at the beautiful view of the ocean.

04:40.016 --> 04:42.560
Daddy's angry with me isn't he?

04:43.601 --> 04:47.187
Ana, you're what he loves most
in the world.

04:47.414 --> 04:49.350
He always tells me so.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.997
I just really want to...

04:52.529 --> 04:55.574
... for the three of us to be together,
that's all.

04:57.699 --> 04:59.326
Don't look so sad.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.273
How about giving me a smile, huh?

05:04.726 --> 05:06.187
Uh uh.

05:06.541 --> 05:08.644
- Oh no?
- Uh uhhh.

05:08.878 --> 05:11.673
I guess then, I'll have to steal one
from you!

05:34.433 --> 05:37.098
And I feel like it's just a
bunch of nonsense.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.678
And that's the problem you know.

05:38.703 --> 05:40.971
It also has to do with the sun you know.

05:41.039 --> 05:44.367
When the sun hits the earth a certain
way, people act strange.

06:05.629 --> 06:06.880
No!

06:09.523 --> 06:10.983
Hey stop it!

06:11.063 --> 06:12.371
Look at what you did!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.915
Crash no!

06:14.225 --> 06:17.019
Mommy, come look what Crash did!

06:17.054 --> 06:18.514
Crash!

06:19.035 --> 06:20.661
Bad dog, no!

06:21.283 --> 06:23.447
Shhh... Shhh.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.504
Can't you see he's sleeping right now?

06:31.632 --> 06:33.843
??

06:33.962 --> 06:37.091
See you've woken him up now!

06:39.140 --> 06:40.301
Hello?

06:40.394 --> 06:42.925
Ahhh hahahahaha.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.414
Oh this girl has a giant head.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.318
And to top it off she's cross-eyed.

06:53.362 --> 06:55.864
Don't make fun of the girl Giggles.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.157
Apologize to her.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.703
This is a really nice puppet.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.955
His name happens to be Giggles.

07:02.997 --> 07:06.375
And he is not a puppet, he's alive.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.836
You're the one moving his mouth though.

07:08.878 --> 07:12.979
Ha! Did you hear that?
She says you're moving my mouth.

07:13.355 --> 07:15.148
But you're controlling him.

07:16.761 --> 07:18.808
I don't what to hurt
his feelings...

07:18.863 --> 07:21.703
...but guess what. I'm actually the one
controlling him.

07:21.939 --> 07:25.318
Just watch. Dance Roque.

07:34.562 --> 07:36.104
Quit it!

07:36.146 --> 07:39.425
Stop doing that to me. Stop it!

07:39.450 --> 07:42.620
Ana, don't bother this gentleman.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.997
Yeah Ana, please stop bothering Roque.

07:45.915 --> 07:48.751
Don't be scared...
I'll calm him right down.

07:48.793 --> 07:51.796
- Take this!
- Bye bye giant head.

07:53.881 --> 07:55.716
Wait a second.

07:55.758 --> 07:58.552
Giggles he escaped.

07:59.387 --> 08:01.259
Take him away. Take him to the third floor.

08:01.287 --> 08:05.249
Let go of me! The third floor? No no no.
Not the third floor!

08:05.518 --> 08:09.438
A thousand pardons Madam, this
gentleman needs to get his rest.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.483
Everyone continue what you were doing.
Please carry on.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.820
Not the third floor. Please no.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.211
Oh no. How could they do it.
Something like this.

08:19.417 --> 08:20.491
- Not possible.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.867
Oh, no...

08:21.909 --> 08:25.579
That old man forgot to take his doll Mommy.
Should I take it to him?

08:26.247 --> 08:29.709
Not the third floor!
Not the third floor, no, no, no!

08:37.717 --> 08:41.178
Not the third floor!
Not the third floor!

08:41.511 --> 08:43.304
Not the third floor...!

08:52.404 --> 08:54.406
He disappeared, Mommy.

08:54.887 --> 08:59.934
Ana, promise me you will never ever
ever, go up to that floor.

09:00.955 --> 09:01.998
Ana?

09:53.375 --> 09:54.794
Crash?

10:00.382 --> 10:01.592
Hey Crash.

10:03.452 --> 10:06.414
Little doggy, is that you?

10:28.494 --> 10:30.037
Crash?

10:33.749 --> 10:35.876
Come here, doggy.

10:48.138 --> 10:49.807
Crash?

11:03.779 --> 11:04.947
Oh!

11:05.656 --> 11:08.478
- What are you doing up here?
- I'm looking for my little dog.

11:08.507 --> 11:12.694
-Do I happen to look like a dog?
-No but you have long ears

11:17.650 --> 11:19.109
Who are you, huh?

11:19.165 --> 11:20.374
My name is Ana.

11:21.689 --> 11:23.524
- Ana?
- Uh huh.

11:23.676 --> 11:24.760
Come.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.538
Ana, come, come. Ana.

11:41.722 --> 11:46.894
No way! No please, go away
leave me alone!

11:48.430 --> 11:50.390
What's going on?

11:50.415 --> 11:53.251
Poncho, what's going on?

11:54.741 --> 11:56.492
You shouldn't do that.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.544
No, no!

11:59.585 --> 12:01.587
-Well...
-Go away!

12:01.978 --> 12:04.559
No need to be scared anymore. Time
to calm down.

12:04.584 --> 12:07.218
There he is! Look look, there he is!

12:07.260 --> 12:09.815
If you remain patient...

12:09.840 --> 12:12.182
He'll go away.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.893
-Calm down... c'mon.
-No.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.845
What's wrong with that man?

12:18.717 --> 12:21.807
- He's a paranoid schizophrenic.
- He's a what?

12:21.849 --> 12:26.228
He's nuts, he's got a screw loose,
he's crazy, cuckoo.

12:40.484 --> 12:42.867
Just imagine. He thinks he's seeing
a little green man.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.061
But then I can also see you too.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.710
Then you're crazy as well.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.212
I'm not crazy.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.204
In here, everybody's nuts...

12:52.279 --> 12:53.696
...except for me.

12:57.171 --> 12:58.429
Tssk.

13:04.668 --> 13:07.045
Bruno, my love.

13:13.484 --> 13:15.903
And who might this be, hmm?

13:15.945 --> 13:18.933
An uninvited guest from downstairs.
Rosie, Ana. Ana, Rosie.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.419
Backwards there together, right?

13:20.458 --> 13:21.931
"Nice to meet you, a pleasure I'll say."

13:21.956 --> 13:25.459
And what does she want, Bruno?
How come she's with you, eh ?

13:27.141 --> 13:28.809
Look me in the eyes.

13:32.128 --> 13:35.947
Fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.466
 Fifty seven.

13:37.508 --> 13:41.595
Uh.. you're running late!
You're... running late!

13:41.637 --> 13:43.848
I've got to get back to my Mommy.

13:43.889 --> 13:47.184
No, wait! Accompany me to
Giggles' goodbye party first.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.958
You're going to take her?

13:48.983 --> 13:52.982
Four thirty seven and forty one,
forty two, forty three.

13:53.023 --> 13:54.734
Hey wait, meet Ana.

13:55.192 --> 13:57.987
Hello, Ana, I'm Hugo.

13:58.028 --> 14:00.296
Nice to meet you.

14:00.614 --> 14:02.473
Give me five.

14:02.867 --> 14:03.909
Who are you guys?

14:03.951 --> 14:06.245
Friends of the bunch of loonies
who live here.

14:06.545 --> 14:07.705
Their friends?

14:07.747 --> 14:11.917
Yes, it's sort of a philanthropic endeavor.
We make life a lot easier for them.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.128
We keep them company whenever
they're lonely.

14:14.170 --> 14:17.169
Which is pretty often because after their
families commit them here...

14:17.194 --> 14:19.493
even if they say the'll come back in
a few days...

14:19.619 --> 14:21.885
they end up always being gone
for good.

14:21.910 --> 14:24.829
Hugo for example, crept out of the head
of that guest over there.

14:25.578 --> 14:29.400
When he was little, he wet the bed
and his parents would beat him.

14:29.477 --> 14:32.229
Hu... hurry, you're running late!

14:32.271 --> 14:34.428
Tic's friend
is compulsively punctual.

14:34.453 --> 14:36.957
Apparently he got stood up when
the love of his life didn't...

14:36.982 --> 14:39.441
elope with him as he planned.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.447
What? What love of her life?

14:41.472 --> 14:43.599
This pachyderm is the product of
the imagination...

14:43.624 --> 14:46.627
...of a hideously controlling
neurotic woman.

14:46.661 --> 14:47.828
And that hairy hand...

14:47.870 --> 14:51.415
well I won't tell you what his owner
was traumatized with.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.425
He... he got away from us.

15:01.462 --> 15:05.174
With our friend Giggles, everyday
was a party.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.399
What happened to him?

15:12.615 --> 15:14.396
See that man there?

15:17.574 --> 15:19.993
That's Roque. He invented Giggles
who died.

15:20.018 --> 15:21.311
He was his hallucination.

15:21.862 --> 15:24.573
-His hallucination?
-His imaginary being.

15:24.615 --> 15:25.908
Why is he like that?

15:25.950 --> 15:27.444
That quack took him into the back room...

15:27.469 --> 15:31.556
...and plugged him to the machine of oblivion
so he wouldn't see his friend anymore.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.084
He turns on his device, click...

15:35.274 --> 15:37.487
A few electric jolts.

15:42.277 --> 15:44.904
And poof! Bye-bye poor Giggles.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.316
Nobody laughed like he did.

16:02.444 --> 16:06.740
I wish I would've had the chance
to get to know him a little better.

16:08.909 --> 16:12.705
He's left us sister.

16:13.038 --> 16:16.333
Now who's gonna be our laughing stock?

16:16.485 --> 16:19.832
You'll have to forgive him please. He's a
bit tipsy right now.

16:20.129 --> 16:21.573
Leave me alone!

16:21.615 --> 16:24.409
I just came here to get some coffee.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.835
Why can't you behave!

16:25.860 --> 16:29.947
Let me go, or I'll make you disappear!
I'll make you disappear okay.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.899
I'll stop thinking about you.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.426
He's the friend of a guy in the
addictions pavilion.

16:34.810 --> 16:39.356
When he drinks, he starts to see bugs
climbing all over the walls.

16:41.108 --> 16:43.569
Well, I really must be going now.

16:45.279 --> 16:49.199
Excuse me. Excuse me if I've offended you.

16:49.392 --> 16:52.604
 It's just that this music is so
darn sad.

16:52.908 --> 16:56.203
It would have made Giggles himself cry.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.894
Yeah! Can't we listen to something
a little more upbeat?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.272
Take your dirty mitts off me!

17:12.198 --> 17:15.409
Respect those who are no longer with us.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.664
I'll bet that Giggles would've wanted us
to say goodbye with a big party.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.893
And without any tears.

17:21.935 --> 17:24.063
It's time to d-d-d...

17:24.907 --> 17:27.286
It's time to dance!

17:32.838 --> 17:36.717
With all due respect little lady.

17:38.703 --> 17:40.474
May I cut in?

17:47.030 --> 17:50.038
- Aren't you going to dance?
- Uh huh.

17:59.287 --> 18:04.854
No, no you're off beat! It's one,
two, three, four, five!

18:09.181 --> 18:11.642
Beautifully elegant...

18:12.271 --> 18:14.732
...my adorable pink elephant.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.058
Shut up you mutt!

18:21.726 --> 18:23.936
I said be quiet silly dog.

18:28.079 --> 18:29.873
Shut up, dog!

18:30.828 --> 18:33.094
I said quiet silly mutt.

18:33.324 --> 18:36.410
Can't you see we're ??

18:44.034 --> 18:46.579
- Is that your dog Crash?
- No.

19:04.175 --> 19:05.552
Run!

19:17.114 --> 19:20.242
What's wrong sweetheart?
Can't you sleep?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.578
I went to the third floor Mommy.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.288
Ana!

19:24.997 --> 19:28.125
- And I met a little green man, and...
- Ana...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.294
And a pinata, and a blowfish...

19:30.336 --> 19:31.295
Calm down sweetie.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.465
Why can I see imaginary beings, Mommy?
Am I crazy?

19:34.507 --> 19:37.218
- It was only a dream dear.
- It wasn't a dream Mommy.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.887
There was a... fire monster.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.138
Fire monster?

19:43.391 --> 19:45.267
Ana! Run, Ana!

19:54.360 --> 19:57.321
-What is it, Mommy?
-Get away, quickly now.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.490
I'll catch up to you in a second.

20:14.090 --> 20:17.008
Is something wrong Miss Carmen?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.802
The monster, it's in here!

20:20.886 --> 20:25.433
First of all let's calm down shall we?

20:26.016 --> 20:28.227
I thought we were safe here...

20:28.269 --> 20:31.355
...but it's found us now!
We have to get out of here!

20:31.397 --> 20:34.483
Where will you be going
dressed like that?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.686
Let me go! It'll get out!

20:37.711 --> 20:40.214
There's absolutely nothing in there.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.783
Have a look.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.377
She's a walking disaster.

20:53.402 --> 20:56.773
- Well then she will have to change floors.
- Hmmm.

21:03.194 --> 21:04.522
Mom.

21:13.465 --> 21:15.967
Let me go!
Where are you taking me?

21:16.001 --> 21:19.088
To a different room, Miss Carmen...

21:19.145 --> 21:21.606
so that you'll feel a lot safer.

21:21.631 --> 21:24.137
-And more comfortable.
-No...

21:27.995 --> 21:30.498
She's raving, poor thing.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.093
Yes... they get that way sometimes...

21:34.118 --> 21:37.213
...when the husband leaves them
for a younger women.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.508
I'm sure he has another family right now.

21:48.831 --> 21:51.831
Mommy? Mommy?

21:51.894 --> 21:56.190
- Mommy?
- Mommy?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.525
Mommy?

21:58.123 --> 22:00.861
Shhh, can't you see people are trying
to recover here.

22:01.463 --> 22:03.382
- Ana.
- Mommy?

22:03.814 --> 22:06.609
-Ana!
-Here Mommy, here I am!

22:06.651 --> 22:08.236
Tic! Tic!

22:10.446 --> 22:13.491
What are you doing here, Ana?
I told you to leave!

22:13.533 --> 22:16.202
I'm not leaving you with that monster
thing Mommy.

22:16.244 --> 22:18.454
Tic, time's up for this lock.

22:18.496 --> 22:20.998
Hurry up. That bonfire with peepers
is coming back!

22:21.040 --> 22:24.383
One s-s-second please. Give me one second!

22:40.393 --> 22:42.353
You've got to warn Dad Ana.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.398
Go get your father.

22:47.275 --> 22:48.651
Leave us alone!

22:50.398 --> 22:53.526
Any day now!

22:55.283 --> 22:56.867
I-I need more t-time.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.649
I-I n-need more t-t-t-time!

23:05.126 --> 23:07.712
Lock it... lock it!

23:08.588 --> 23:09.922
My Mommy!

23:10.256 --> 23:11.823
Her Mommy?

23:20.182 --> 23:23.185
Well well well.  Too hot for you
to handle?

23:23.227 --> 23:25.771
I see. You need to cool down.

23:28.482 --> 23:30.943
Water! Water stops it!

23:37.408 --> 23:39.910
Go on. Do what your mother
told you to do.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.997
- And her?
- We promise to take care of her.

24:15.436 --> 24:19.592
[Crash barking at window]

24:34.665 --> 24:36.982
Be careful cause I'm not waterproof!

24:37.134 --> 24:40.471
No ??, no holdups. Keep that storm coming!

24:41.391 --> 24:44.185
Escape Ana, escape!

25:21.429 --> 25:24.765
And at the count of th-three...

25:25.057 --> 25:28.394
...you'll awake and remember none of this.

25:28.436 --> 25:32.565
One, two and three.

25:37.778 --> 25:43.492
Move it move it move it. C'mon move it.

25:52.001 --> 25:55.004
All aboard.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.029
Bruno?

26:20.054 --> 26:23.099
You'll catch a cold. Better come in
out of the draft right now.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.078
Quiet Crash.

26:26.258 --> 26:28.629
- What's our destination?
- San Marcos.

26:28.662 --> 26:31.290
San Marcos? What's that, a spa?

26:31.332 --> 26:33.292
Is there skiing, horseback riding?

26:33.334 --> 26:36.921
- That's the town where we live.
- I needed a change of scenery!

26:36.962 --> 26:41.050
The madhouse routine: get up,
annoy the madman, let him rest...

26:41.091 --> 26:43.928
...annoy the madman again.
It was starting to stifle me.

26:44.870 --> 26:49.500
- We shouldn't go back for at lease a month.
- A month? I gotta go back today.

26:51.820 --> 26:54.296
- Today?
- I have to get my Daddy there.

26:54.338 --> 26:56.298
Bu why? Is he also a...

26:56.549 --> 26:58.008
like your Mommy?

26:58.050 --> 27:00.553
Listen my Mommy's not crazy!

27:00.594 --> 27:03.013
She isn't? Then how come she sees
fire monsters?

27:03.055 --> 27:07.789
I saw it too Bruno, just like I can see you.
Does that make me crazy?

27:07.935 --> 27:11.066
-No, what makes you think that?
-You're just a kid.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.029
Well that's different.

27:14.079 --> 27:17.697
Well you see children and animals
can often times see us.

27:17.820 --> 27:20.489
Uh huh. And drunks can too.

27:22.450 --> 27:24.330
All of you guys came?

27:24.702 --> 27:28.122
We all want to visit San Marcos too!

27:28.164 --> 27:31.333
How could you think we'd leave
you alone.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.377
So who's taking care of my Mommy?

27:33.402 --> 27:34.706
Ohh!

27:51.854 --> 27:53.814
Goodness gracious!

27:54.812 --> 27:59.775
We'd better tranquilize her then before
she begins to destroy everything.

28:15.500 --> 28:19.588
Hey, don't worry yourself.
Your mom is in good hands.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.068
While we're on vacation the doctor will
apply all of his little shocks...

28:23.093 --> 28:25.512
so that incubus won't keep popping
up on her.

28:29.365 --> 28:32.409
- Where did she s-say we're going?
- To San Marcos.

28:33.193 --> 28:35.737
Wake me up when we get there.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.495
Some, some something's wrong.

28:50.114 --> 28:54.202
Take it easy Rolex. Enjoy the view
and forget your worries.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.698
No, no it's just that we'll never get
there this way.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.590
The c-c-compass says we're going the
opposite direction.

29:01.731 --> 29:03.668
San Marcos is south.

29:03.693 --> 29:07.587
And right now we're going north... northeast.

29:08.305 --> 29:10.516
We've got to catch another train.

29:10.558 --> 29:11.809
Another train?

29:12.768 --> 29:15.604
Tickets please! Tickets!

29:17.150 --> 29:18.753
Cover us!

29:19.608 --> 29:22.486
Tickets in hand ladies and gentlemen.

29:22.528 --> 29:26.073
- Um..
- Cover us, come on.

29:26.882 --> 29:29.093
C'mon are you pouting or do you
want a kiss?

29:29.118 --> 29:31.007
May I have your ticket...?

29:31.032 --> 29:32.199
Madam, please!

29:32.788 --> 29:35.207
- C'mon guys let's go!
- Oh my!

29:35.249 --> 29:37.001
Open the door Madam.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.237
Get a move on.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.074
They left me all alone.

29:46.343 --> 29:48.512
This way...

29:53.585 --> 29:55.944
Ha haa!

30:07.715 --> 30:10.426
What am I going crazy?

30:14.305 --> 30:17.166
You all right... doll face.

30:26.008 --> 30:27.849
Careful... ahhh.

30:29.386 --> 30:33.065
Never abandon me again.
Understood? Never!

30:33.113 --> 30:35.448
Never, never, never!

30:35.559 --> 30:38.728
- Never.
- Oh. I see two trains.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.065
Pipe down wino.

30:41.398 --> 30:43.108
Swear to me!

30:43.150 --> 30:45.277
Yes, there are two, look!

30:46.570 --> 30:49.365
South... north... north... south.

30:50.101 --> 30:52.665
That one is going south!

30:53.494 --> 30:56.956
All those who want to visit San Marcos,
now's the time!

31:10.628 --> 31:12.839
There's no way you're leaving
me alone again!

31:13.013 --> 31:15.641
Let go, Ana needs my help.

31:23.774 --> 31:25.943
Jump, Ana, jump now.

31:25.977 --> 31:28.855
You better not fall girlie.

31:47.097 --> 31:49.141
What? Who me?

31:59.777 --> 32:02.404
Hi there, hi there.

32:02.446 --> 32:05.491
How's our little patient
this morning?

32:08.285 --> 32:11.163
Why do this Madam?

32:11.509 --> 32:14.493
Why did you destroy your room
in this manner?

32:14.518 --> 32:16.187
Tell me Madam.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.462
It was the monster.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.923
The monster?

32:20.965 --> 32:25.636
So this means that the "fire monster"
is still bothering us?

32:25.678 --> 32:29.056
It attacked us,  my daughter and me.

32:29.306 --> 32:30.766
Let's see so tell me.

32:31.759 --> 32:34.970
Do you see a monster in this room?

32:41.522 --> 32:43.440
It's behind you right now.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.475
No Madam.

32:47.283 --> 32:50.160
Behind me there is only air, see .

32:54.407 --> 32:56.158
Now tell me...

32:57.201 --> 32:59.745
where is your daughter?

33:04.083 --> 33:09.422
-Where is Ana?
-No, no!

33:11.783 --> 33:15.350
Hello madam? Mrs. Carmen?

33:49.747 --> 33:51.207
Your town ain't that bad, huh.

33:51.422 --> 33:54.091
This really isn't my town though, we're
in the Capital.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.444
We still have a very long way
to San Marcos.

33:56.499 --> 34:01.015
 It lies 78.9 Kilometers south-southeast.
South-east to be exact.

34:29.210 --> 34:32.463
Oh, s-s-so much t-t-time!

34:43.599 --> 34:46.851
The whole city must be crazy.

34:49.505 --> 34:55.219
The train must be quick, very fast now,
heading north to south it's got to be.

34:56.277 --> 34:58.614
- Hey!
- Girlie isn't enough?!

34:58.656 --> 35:01.826
You also want to follow that asparagus
back to her hometown?

35:02.185 --> 35:04.896
Ana? Where's Ana?

35:15.589 --> 35:17.800
Spare any coins anyone?

35:18.342 --> 35:20.469
Can you spare any coins anybody?

35:21.446 --> 35:23.698
Spare any coins anyone?

35:23.879 --> 35:26.131
- I don't have any.
- Not a single penny?

35:26.642 --> 35:28.227
Look again.

35:30.020 --> 35:32.106
What, you don't believe I'm blind?

35:32.148 --> 35:35.025
- Sorry.
- Why don't you ask your parents.

35:35.067 --> 35:38.863
My dad is in San Marcos. I'm trying to look
for a train to see him.

35:38.904 --> 35:43.701
Ah no. There's only one a day going
to San Marcos and it's gone.

35:43.743 --> 35:45.244
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

35:45.548 --> 35:48.801
I practically live here. Track seven.

35:53.169 --> 35:55.254
- What's his name?
- Crash.

35:55.296 --> 35:56.297
- Me too.
- Huh?

35:57.298 --> 35:59.842
I crash all the time. Hello Crash.

36:00.342 --> 36:02.178
You mind if I play with him a little bit?

36:02.219 --> 36:06.849
But I just can't wait until tomorrow. I need
to warn my dad that my mom is in danger.

36:06.891 --> 36:08.809
Well, let's go then.

36:11.687 --> 36:13.814
Do you want to go
to San Marcos or not?

36:13.856 --> 36:16.378
- Okay, let me find my friends.
- Friends?

36:16.403 --> 36:19.322
I thought you were here all alone,
except for Crash.

36:19.347 --> 36:22.684
What do you mean now. There's Bruno,
Tic, and the elephant girl.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.339
Uh huh, yeah, uh huh.  I also have
a bunch of friends.

36:26.364 --> 36:28.011
Everyone can come.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.926
Gypsies are kidnapping the girl!

36:42.316 --> 36:44.754
Oops, hahahaha.

36:47.181 --> 36:48.970
Do you really know another way
to get there?

36:49.057 --> 36:49.955
Yup.

36:50.059 --> 36:51.143
How?

36:56.812 --> 36:57.608
Hey!

36:57.650 --> 37:00.861
- No money. Get a job.
- How many do you want?

37:00.903 --> 37:02.279
- Five.
- With everything?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.656
Yeah with everything.

37:06.278 --> 37:08.739
- Hop on in!
- But I don't know how to drive.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.568
I do.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.502
Huh?

37:16.877 --> 37:19.380
Get out of my car you fools!

37:38.975 --> 37:41.276
Hey don't you worry. I've come to
rescue you.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.451
I'll subdue the gypsie in no time.

37:48.161 --> 37:51.952
No wait, he's not a kidnapper. He's
taking us to San Marcos.

37:52.203 --> 37:56.060
Really this guy right here. You're
going to die.

37:56.402 --> 37:57.445
What?

37:57.558 --> 37:58.934
What were you saying?

37:59.637 --> 38:01.138
Be careful.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.389
Do you want to drive?
I'll teach you.

38:10.806 --> 38:13.058
- Take the wheel, take it.
- Me, me!

38:17.438 --> 38:19.106
That's it. You're doing great.

38:19.148 --> 38:22.693
At this rate, we'll be in San Marcos
in the blink of an eye.

38:27.114 --> 38:29.742
What is wrong with you. We're gonna crash.
Give me the wheel.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.581
- All of it, give me all of it.
- Full steam ahead?

38:32.912 --> 38:34.371
Pedal to the metal!

38:37.037 --> 38:39.168
Let go right now.

38:46.675 --> 38:50.137
Not bad for the first time,
but you need practice.

39:02.816 --> 39:04.485
Brake!

39:08.992 --> 39:10.826
We'll fix it in a minute.

39:18.702 --> 39:20.621
Hey, where are you going?

39:20.646 --> 39:23.608
I have to get there,
even if it's on foot.

39:23.737 --> 39:24.947
Well um...

39:25.489 --> 39:27.575
We can always hitch-hike over there.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.324
The most important thing is to smile.

39:41.059 --> 39:42.831
- I'm going to San Marcos. Does that
work for you?

39:42.880 --> 39:43.942
Uh huh.

40:11.521 --> 40:13.591
You make a ?? with me.

40:16.999 --> 40:20.544
I like you. I mean so much.

40:20.586 --> 40:23.255
You understand me brother.

40:32.709 --> 40:34.987
- My name is Ana.
- I'm  Daniel.

40:35.436 --> 40:37.481
Thanks for accompanying us Daniel.

40:37.686 --> 40:41.273
It's no problem. It's not like they're
expecting me anywhere.

40:41.490 --> 40:42.908
And your family?

40:43.325 --> 40:45.828
My parents died when I was very little.

40:46.771 --> 40:48.939
You must miss them a lot, huh?

40:50.107 --> 40:54.153
Sometimes I imagine their voices
calling to me in the terminal.

40:54.445 --> 40:58.449
As if they were coming for me on a
train from very very far away.

41:01.822 --> 41:04.260
[All] Aahhhh.

41:19.045 --> 41:21.089
If you wait a little longer...

41:21.555 --> 41:23.766
you can have them both?

41:23.808 --> 41:27.144
The girl will be back in no time.

41:36.195 --> 41:38.030
Excuse me.

41:38.322 --> 41:42.255
We want to help you try on your
brand new dress.

41:43.961 --> 41:45.539
- Huh?
- Heh heh heh.

41:51.110 --> 41:52.320
Thank you.

41:53.594 --> 41:57.014
Run guys. Go be free.

42:03.372 --> 42:06.917
Oh don't start throwing goats now.

42:10.087 --> 42:12.340
Our house is on the other side of town.

42:12.381 --> 42:15.801
It has the highest and prettiest
weathervane of all!

42:16.992 --> 42:19.661
Huh? Watch where you're going kid!

42:22.767 --> 42:25.830
Whoa goat. Whoa giddy-up.

42:25.855 --> 42:27.521
Giddy up little goatie.

42:27.563 --> 42:29.283
Yaw.

42:58.219 --> 43:02.807
The facade, completed in 1537,
is a represent-ta-tive...

43:02.848 --> 43:05.559
of the American plat-plat-plateresque.

43:05.601 --> 43:11.190
The clock, manufactured in Vienna, slows
18 seconds every fifty years.

43:11.731 --> 43:13.931
Take one for your boy or girl.

43:13.956 --> 43:17.334
Buy a balloon. Buy your kid a
balloon here.

43:18.030 --> 43:21.242
Ah, a happy ending!

43:21.617 --> 43:25.150
The girl runs to find her father, the
goats have won their liberty...

43:25.175 --> 43:29.971
and us, after having done our good deeds,
take a well deserved rest.

43:31.043 --> 43:32.565
With more effort please!

43:32.290 --> 43:33.836
Faster!

43:34.630 --> 43:37.333
She doesn't need you anymore Bruno.

43:37.757 --> 43:41.500
Now she has a friend that's real.

43:48.553 --> 43:53.433
Down, down, good boy, good boy.

43:53.891 --> 43:54.976
Goatee.

43:59.776 --> 44:01.236
Daddy!

44:03.443 --> 44:07.572
Come. Come princess, come.
I'll take you home.

44:08.281 --> 44:09.365
It's okay .

44:11.064 --> 44:12.357
Daddy!

44:12.417 --> 44:14.294
Have you seen your dad yet?

44:14.818 --> 44:15.944
Ana?

44:16.831 --> 44:17.527
Hi.

44:18.404 --> 44:19.697
Alright.

44:56.787 --> 44:58.539
Did you find your dad yet Ana?

44:58.799 --> 45:01.427
My dad already forgot about us both.

45:02.919 --> 45:07.381
That's why he abandoned us at the clinic.
All we are is a bother to him.

45:08.190 --> 45:11.719
No big deal. After all, who needs a dad?

45:11.761 --> 45:13.763
Let's go chase some goats, okay?

45:13.804 --> 45:17.158
You don't understand anything,
you don't understand!

45:17.717 --> 45:20.302
Since you've never had anybody!

45:20.344 --> 45:23.973
Well no, but now I have you guys, right?

45:24.177 --> 45:25.345
Ana?

45:25.808 --> 45:27.184
Ana?

45:30.491 --> 45:31.826
Crash?

45:40.030 --> 45:43.868
- Where are you taking me?
- Just relax maam.

45:44.236 --> 45:47.323
The doctor wants to invite you to his table.

45:52.388 --> 45:53.765
Howdy.

45:53.836 --> 45:57.173
Hey, what's Poncho
so happy about?

45:57.214 --> 46:01.427
He says he hasn't seen a single
little green man all day long.

46:01.849 --> 46:03.095
No way.

46:03.137 --> 46:05.264
And he's not the only one.

46:05.306 --> 46:08.893
Maria hasn't obsessed over
what time it is all day.

46:09.310 --> 46:11.937
Yes, you're actually right.

46:12.271 --> 46:17.193
Don Alejandro has also stopped
talking to the toilets.

46:17.610 --> 46:19.987
What on earth is going on?

46:20.237 --> 46:21.725
You see, madam...

46:21.750 --> 46:25.286
Can you see Dr. Mendez's
treatments really work.

46:29.141 --> 46:31.060
Come in, madam.

46:52.148 --> 46:56.820
Sorry, I can't stand
seeing people cry.

47:02.963 --> 47:06.383
By the way, why are we crying?

47:06.425 --> 47:09.011
My father wasn't coming to see us.

47:10.911 --> 47:13.038
He has another family now.

47:13.142 --> 47:18.022
That old pig! A family on the side,
and in the same town.

47:18.707 --> 47:21.559
Well well, we came
all this way for nothing.

47:21.598 --> 47:25.611
Enough said. Pleasure keeping you company,
but we have to go now.

47:25.653 --> 47:27.071
Right Bruno?

47:27.112 --> 47:29.281
Would you like us to go back to
the clinic on tomorrows train?

47:29.323 --> 47:30.937
What do you mean tomorrow?

47:31.000 --> 47:34.352
Where are we gonna spend the night
in this one-horse town?

47:35.621 --> 47:39.249
My house. We can stay over there.
Let's go.

47:44.880 --> 47:49.551
If you think I'm gonna let you spend the
night in that boyfriend stealers house.

47:49.593 --> 47:51.804
Listen here you erasure-colored pachyderm!

47:51.845 --> 47:54.803
Ana hasn't stolen anything from you
and I can never be your boyfriend.

47:54.834 --> 47:55.850
Never!

47:56.976 --> 47:59.561
Engrave that on your legendary memory.

47:59.603 --> 48:01.230
You are not my type!

48:01.271 --> 48:03.649
Do you know how I like them?
Like this.

48:03.691 --> 48:06.902
I'd follow one like this all the
way to Mars, but...

48:06.944 --> 48:10.781
But never, ever, ever would I fall in
love with a gigantic pig...

48:10.823 --> 48:13.254
with a tail
in the middle of her face!

48:13.419 --> 48:14.009
Huh?!

48:14.444 --> 48:16.423
Oh and those awful rags you knit for me...

48:16.448 --> 48:18.088
are horrible.

48:18.120 --> 48:19.873
I hate them!

48:32.636 --> 48:34.179
Almost there.

48:34.250 --> 48:36.043
It's just over the hill.

48:38.058 --> 48:40.352
We should see be able to see
the weathervane.

48:43.941 --> 48:45.714
What happened?

48:51.268 --> 48:52.815
Holey moley.

48:53.115 --> 48:56.201
You can tell there was a lot of warmth
in your home, huh.

49:11.258 --> 49:12.676
Daddy?

49:16.858 --> 49:19.027
I miss you so much sweetheart.

49:19.805 --> 49:22.015
Why did you leave us Daddy?

49:22.285 --> 49:26.252
Forgive me please.
There was nothing I could do.

49:26.452 --> 49:28.830
What happened to our home Daddy?

49:31.653 --> 49:33.947
I couldn't live here anymore.

49:34.773 --> 49:37.025
Best to leave it this way.

49:37.419 --> 49:39.400
I'm in another place now.

49:41.991 --> 49:42.992
Ana.

49:44.204 --> 49:47.457
I don't want to ?? this way...

49:47.838 --> 49:49.891
but things haven't been easy in the least...

49:49.946 --> 49:52.094
for either of us sweetheart.

49:53.432 --> 49:54.433
I...

49:56.248 --> 49:57.458
I get by somehow.

49:59.744 --> 50:01.370
But your mommy...

50:01.597 --> 50:04.071
Daddy, you've got
to get her out of there!

50:04.096 --> 50:06.557
They wanna do terrible things.

50:07.419 --> 50:09.630
There's nothing I can do.

50:11.985 --> 50:13.764
I'm so sorry.

50:13.802 --> 50:16.472
How can you ever say that Daddy?

50:16.999 --> 50:19.501
You're the only person that can save her.

50:22.588 --> 50:25.674
I'll try to visit you more often sweetie.

50:31.597 --> 50:32.973
Goodbye.

50:33.214 --> 50:35.402
Wait a second Daddy.

51:15.124 --> 51:16.542
Who died?

51:18.233 --> 51:19.193
She did.

51:19.336 --> 51:20.337
Ana?

51:23.007 --> 51:24.758
She's a ghost!

51:28.137 --> 51:31.432
I am not a ghost! I'm alive!

51:33.225 --> 51:36.186
- Then what's that?
- I don't know. There must be some mistake.

51:36.228 --> 51:38.689
Look at me, I'm alive!

51:40.506 --> 51:41.840
Unless maybe...

51:44.987 --> 51:48.284
Of course! You're a hallucination!

51:48.334 --> 51:50.002
A hallucination?

51:50.232 --> 51:52.692
Uh huh, you're just like us.

51:54.997 --> 51:58.292
I don't want to be a hallucination!

51:58.660 --> 52:00.932
There's nothing wrong with being imaginary.

52:00.979 --> 52:03.144
??

52:06.133 --> 52:07.509
That's so gross.

52:09.428 --> 52:11.347
Perhaps our owners aren't so peaceful...

52:11.388 --> 52:13.807
but as their hallucination we have
a pretty good time.

52:13.849 --> 52:16.977
Sometimes we're even good to them,
like you and your Mommy.

52:17.175 --> 52:20.178
She's the one who's been imagining me?

52:20.940 --> 52:24.944
That means... she really is crazy.

52:25.035 --> 52:26.612
Double trouble then.

52:27.571 --> 52:29.617
Because she doesn't just have one
friend, but two.

52:29.642 --> 52:32.032
Well no, one friend and one enemy.

52:32.326 --> 52:35.453
That hideous creature is also the product
of her imagination.

52:35.478 --> 52:38.063
- But, but why?
- I don't know.

52:38.290 --> 52:42.044
I guess it's just not easy for her to
accept what happened to you.

52:45.026 --> 52:48.863
Can all imaginary beings really do
anything they want?

52:48.999 --> 52:50.792
Anything you want.

52:51.532 --> 52:53.328
I want to face the monster...

52:53.353 --> 52:56.523
so that my Mommy won't suffer anymore
and be cured.

52:56.551 --> 52:58.344
Did you blow a fuse upstairs?

52:58.644 --> 53:01.262
If she's cured she'll stop imagining you.

53:01.287 --> 53:05.416
Yes. Can't you r-r-remember what
happened to Gi-ggles Ana?

53:08.070 --> 53:09.834
But the monster too.

53:09.874 --> 53:12.038
He would disappear forever as well.

53:12.066 --> 53:14.277
The thing is the both of you
would disappear.

53:14.302 --> 53:18.390
Uh huh. Together with everything your
Mommy's keeping here inside.

53:22.543 --> 53:26.881
Think of it as a cleanse, a rinsing out
if you will madam.

53:27.354 --> 53:30.119
When the electricity passes through
your brain...

53:30.144 --> 53:35.941
it will take away all of that anguish
and those painful memories.

53:36.020 --> 53:38.731
Leaving it just like new.

53:52.504 --> 53:56.050
You'll feel only a slight
tingling sensation.

54:06.456 --> 54:08.011
No no no.

54:14.011 --> 54:15.135
Oh, no!

54:15.160 --> 54:16.870
And now...

54:17.316 --> 54:20.194
Let there be light!

54:32.782 --> 54:34.492
Manu!

55:00.904 --> 55:02.364
Please help me.

55:02.429 --> 55:04.931
Only you can get her out of there.

55:08.531 --> 55:10.908
I have to get my dad to listen to me!

55:21.211 --> 55:22.630
This is it.

55:22.820 --> 55:26.448
Wow. It's pretty big for a love nest.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.619
So now, how do we get inside?

55:43.530 --> 55:45.741
You catch on pretty quick!

55:50.003 --> 55:51.713
Can I enter his dreams?

55:52.785 --> 55:56.372
- Well um, theoretically.
- Daddy...

55:58.180 --> 56:01.100
It's me, your daughter Ana.

56:07.216 --> 56:09.837
Wake up Daddy, wake up.

56:09.862 --> 56:11.864
We've gotta go help Mommy.

56:16.976 --> 56:19.561
Uh uh. You've got to do it
with conviction.

56:19.603 --> 56:21.021
Like this.

56:22.022 --> 56:24.008
Hey sir! Psst.

56:24.316 --> 56:27.167
Ana's father, wake up already.

56:27.192 --> 56:28.777
Your daughter needs you.

56:33.867 --> 56:35.463
Time to get up, lazy bones.

56:35.488 --> 56:37.699
Don't you get it. Your daughter needs you.

56:37.913 --> 56:40.916
Waaaake uuuuup now!

56:40.958 --> 56:43.335
Wake up Daddy! Wake up!

56:47.545 --> 56:49.005
- Tic.
- What?

56:49.425 --> 56:51.093
We need time to run faster!

56:51.135 --> 56:53.595
H-h-how if I can hardly walk.

56:57.016 --> 56:58.892
Forgive me father.

57:02.813 --> 57:04.982
Yes, yes wake up Daddy!

57:08.878 --> 57:10.213
Hurry up!

57:24.105 --> 57:27.942
What's this Mr. Richard? Why are you
up so early?

57:27.967 --> 57:30.261
I slept in and now I'm running very late.

57:32.384 --> 57:35.424
- It's already 6:30.
- What would you like for breakfast?

57:35.508 --> 57:36.593
No!

57:36.797 --> 57:38.965
No, no I don't have time maam, but thanks.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.457
Of course you do.

57:40.482 --> 57:44.569
No guest of mine leaves this house
with their stomach empty.

57:45.952 --> 57:49.038
It's not a love nest, it's only a
guest house.

57:49.072 --> 57:51.032
I'll fix something right up for you.

57:51.465 --> 57:52.925
No, Bruno!

57:52.950 --> 57:54.869
Well to be honest, I am kinda hungry.

57:58.910 --> 58:01.204
You've got to take better
care of yourself.

58:01.229 --> 58:03.523
How much weight have you lost
since you got here?

58:03.999 --> 58:07.669
I don't know. I don't even know
what day it is to be honest.

58:08.462 --> 58:12.150
- By the way, haven't I paid you this week?
- Don't worry Mr. Richard.

58:12.203 --> 58:13.587
No no no.  What do you mean.

58:13.638 --> 58:16.961
With all the expenses you have, attending
to your wife...

58:16.986 --> 58:19.059
That's it. Remember Mommy!

58:19.181 --> 58:20.812
You can just pay me later.

58:22.963 --> 58:24.502
I dreamt about Ana.

58:32.270 --> 58:33.771
It was so real.

58:34.506 --> 58:37.092
It was if she were there right next
to my bed.

58:38.325 --> 58:40.058
Oh, Mr. Richard.

58:40.098 --> 58:42.548
It worked Bruno, it worked!

58:42.884 --> 58:46.739
Oh yeah? How'd you do that?
You gotta teach me.

58:46.764 --> 58:49.099
It wasn't a dream Daddy, I'm here!

58:49.124 --> 58:53.378
- I think I ought to visit her more often.
- Not me, Mommy. Go get her.

58:53.491 --> 58:55.184
And how is Mrs. Carmen doing?

58:55.208 --> 58:55.849
Uh huh.

58:55.874 --> 58:59.169
Well the doctor promised to do
everything in his power.

58:59.351 --> 59:01.365
People say that he's a visionary.

59:01.413 --> 59:03.538
That he uses the most advanced methods.

59:03.762 --> 59:06.265
Yeah sure, he slices up your brain and
sticks it in a toaster.

59:06.221 --> 59:08.557
But um, he needs time.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.143
I'm planning on visiting her at the
end of the month.

59:12.245 --> 59:14.698
No. By then it will be too late Daddy.

59:14.902 --> 59:16.612
We've gotta do something!

59:26.378 --> 59:28.964
It's seven already. Ooh, how the
time flies.

59:28.989 --> 59:30.511
Now I really must get going.

59:32.102 --> 59:32.780
Mommy?

59:32.829 --> 59:35.860
Yes honey. I'll be right there to
play with you my dear.

59:39.173 --> 59:42.134
My goodness. It's so cloudy out there.

59:42.632 --> 59:44.605
Must you go out today Mr. Richard?

59:44.754 --> 59:46.286
Yes Daddy, yes!

59:46.333 --> 59:48.030
- Yes Daddy.
- Huh?

59:49.029 --> 59:52.157
I mean... yes Miss Emily.

59:52.308 --> 59:53.977
I really have to go.

59:54.451 --> 59:55.619
Thank you.

01:00:06.005 --> 01:00:07.548
This can't be.

01:00:17.641 --> 01:00:21.746
I didn't release the goats officer. I was
just leaving. I was leaving.

01:00:21.804 --> 01:00:22.805
Crash?

01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:25.524
Ow! What are you doing here?

01:00:25.691 --> 01:00:27.693
Did Ana leave you too?

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:39.065
Do something. Patch them. Turn yourself
into wheels.

01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:41.298
Hey now, we're not made of rubber
you know.

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:45.523
- Need some help with that neighbor?
- Yes. Could you lend me a spare please?

01:00:48.396 --> 01:00:51.483
- Are you going on a trip?
- Just to the capital.

01:00:51.508 --> 01:00:54.136
Not the city Daddy, no.

01:00:56.013 --> 01:00:59.058
Rosie would pick this up
in the blink of an eye.

01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:01.768
Where did nosy Rosie go I wonder?

01:01:09.606 --> 01:01:11.071
Daniel.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:18.007
Wait for me, Daniel!

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.144
Where you  going?

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:25.021
I need you to help me with my Daddy.
I know he would listen to you.

01:01:25.543 --> 01:01:28.504
Tell him I need to go to the seaside
to get my Mommy!

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.672
Did you hear me Daniel?

01:01:33.117 --> 01:01:34.539
Daniel did you hear me?

01:01:34.564 --> 01:01:36.441
I heard you. I'm not deaf.

01:01:37.325 --> 01:01:41.371
Listen, one of the things you learn
when you don't have anybody...

01:01:41.607 --> 01:01:44.777
is that you don't actually need
anybody in life.

01:01:45.023 --> 01:01:46.348
Yesterday for example...

01:01:46.505 --> 01:01:49.638
a girl I met asked me to accompany
her to her home town.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.404
And what thanks do I get?

01:01:51.428 --> 01:01:54.085
She booted me there. In the middle
of a strange place.

01:01:54.154 --> 01:01:55.989
No roof, no one around.

01:01:56.573 --> 01:01:59.493
The scenery apparently was
really something.

01:02:00.122 --> 01:02:03.208
But I survived... as always.

01:02:03.601 --> 01:02:08.189
I figured you must be even better at
handling yourself alone.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.660
I didn't mean to abandon you.

01:02:12.213 --> 01:02:15.842
It's just... it's all happened so fast.

01:02:17.054 --> 01:02:20.182
Forgive me, you have the right
to be angry now.

01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:22.112
But it isn't true that you're alone.

01:02:22.346 --> 01:02:26.851
There are more beings than you can
imagine that are all around you.

01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:33.935
We aren't alone Daniel and we can't
handle everything ourselves.

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:47.494
Daddy!

01:02:50.048 --> 01:02:51.174
Is he leaving?

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.914
Yes. It's a new record in tire changing.

01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:57.084
- Wait for me, Daddy!
- Huh?

01:02:59.336 --> 01:03:01.213
Wait for us!

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:02.840
Daddy!

01:03:03.299 --> 01:03:05.245
Get out of my way little girl.

01:03:06.343 --> 01:03:09.263
Oh, why did you do that?

01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:12.045
Um, I thought the car was gonna
run her over.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.989
How could the car run her over when
she was behind the car Rosie?

01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:23.903
Why did you do thaaaaat!

01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:26.931
Out of love. I did it out of love.

01:03:35.497 --> 01:03:36.874
Daniel!

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:39.126
Wanna go for a spin?

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.878
Hop in!

01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:43.348
Hey!

01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:47.915
Don't take my bike. Come back here.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:48.981
Ow.

01:03:51.805 --> 01:03:55.225
There goes my Daddy. Catch him. Go.

01:04:01.774 --> 01:04:03.859
You missed the right turn!

01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:16.790
??

01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:25.839
He got away.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.967
What did you say?

01:04:29.051 --> 01:04:30.678
He got away!

01:04:33.052 --> 01:04:34.512
I'm useless. aren't I.

01:04:35.562 --> 01:04:39.191
It's not your fault at all. He wouldn't
listen to me anyway.

01:04:45.509 --> 01:04:47.136
Sorry, Ana.

01:04:50.764 --> 01:04:52.057
The train!

01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:53.684
- Where is it?
- That way.

01:04:54.018 --> 01:04:55.477
Hold on tight.

01:04:59.607 --> 01:05:01.358
Go left Daniel.

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.098
- Am I doing okay?
- Yes.

01:05:11.118 --> 01:05:12.872
Take care of him for me.

01:05:12.897 --> 01:05:15.441
Yes yes, I'll take care of him.
Get on the train.

01:05:26.116 --> 01:05:27.575
Have you jumped already?

01:05:27.743 --> 01:05:30.246
- Daniel.
- I'm jumping too.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:48.050
Goodbye Ana.

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:06.455
Bravo Ana, you made it back on.
Well done.

01:06:06.724 --> 01:06:09.310
Yaay.

01:06:15.857 --> 01:06:18.486
Rosie, why did they do this to you?

01:06:18.544 --> 01:06:21.964
She can't be trusted. She's the one who
flattened your dad's tires.

01:06:22.043 --> 01:06:25.191
I've already told you that I did it
out of love Bruno.

01:06:25.368 --> 01:06:27.870
Out of love!

01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:32.367
You know this is all your fault Rosie.

01:06:32.651 --> 01:06:34.696
Yeah sure I know I was wrong...

01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:37.432
and I apologize, alright?

01:06:38.297 --> 01:06:39.250
No!

01:06:39.282 --> 01:06:42.782
It's all your fault Rosie for allowing Bruno
to treat you this way in the first place.

01:06:43.135 --> 01:06:46.055
You seriously ought to find someone
who really loves you.

01:06:48.307 --> 01:06:50.726
And you. Aren't you ashamed?

01:06:51.018 --> 01:06:53.987
I just wanted to help you get to the clinic
as quickly as possible...

01:06:54.422 --> 01:06:55.890
without any setbacks.

01:06:55.981 --> 01:06:58.067
If you truly want to help me Bruno...

01:06:58.108 --> 01:07:02.279
then teach me how to disappear and
appear someplace else like you guys.

01:07:03.282 --> 01:07:05.076
I will be your teacher.

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:08.118
- What are you up to now?
- Helping her out.

01:07:08.577 --> 01:07:13.017
The first step is to take a
very deep inhale.

01:07:16.753 --> 01:07:19.580
Listen, I can teach you as well, okay?

01:07:19.629 --> 01:07:21.357
Wouldn't you rather have me as
a teacher?

01:07:21.581 --> 01:07:25.017
Step two. You have to really, and I
mean...

01:07:25.052 --> 01:07:26.804
 really want it.

01:07:28.592 --> 01:07:31.970
Focus in on your target. Don't lose
sight of it for not even for an instant.

01:07:32.184 --> 01:07:35.938
I wanna be in the clinic now.
I wanna be in the clinic now.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:41.318
- I wanna be in the clinic now.
- And now, you are simply there Ana.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.196
- You're there.
- I'm over there. I'm over there.

01:07:48.242 --> 01:07:50.578
- She did it!
- She did it. Yaay.

01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:55.165
- She did it!
- Ana did it, she did it, she did it!

01:07:58.682 --> 01:08:00.291
Awww.

01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:02.956
Well uh, you gotta start somewhere.

01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:11.761
Here comes a big one. Smile Crash.

01:08:20.377 --> 01:08:21.959
Be careful Crash.

01:08:27.656 --> 01:08:30.326
- Are you all right?
- I am, how about you?

01:08:30.367 --> 01:08:31.398
Ohhh.

01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:34.872
Are you headed into the city?

01:08:44.747 --> 01:08:48.959
If you're tired I can help drive okay?
Just let me know.

01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:50.621
You know how to drive?

01:08:50.662 --> 01:08:54.250
Ooh a bit of everything. Motorcycles, trucks,
tractors, convertibles...

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:57.169
I can't fly a plane. But if you teach me...

01:08:57.285 --> 01:08:59.287
And how do you see the road?

01:08:59.712 --> 01:09:01.215
I just imagine it sir.

01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:11.140
Your dog seems familiar to me.

01:09:11.517 --> 01:09:14.103
It's Ana's. I'm just taking care of it.

01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:16.063
Ana?

01:09:16.104 --> 01:09:19.196
She's a friend of mine that I helped travel
to San Marcos...

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.680
so that she could find her dad.

01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:25.238
I once had a daughter. Her name was
also Ana.

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:27.316
And what happened to her?

01:09:28.617 --> 01:09:30.928
One night while we were sleeping...

01:09:31.287 --> 01:09:33.397
there was a short circuit.

01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:36.794
By the time the smoke awakened me...

01:09:37.053 --> 01:09:39.170
the house was already in flames.

01:09:49.555 --> 01:09:51.979
I'm gonna go stretch my legs for a bit.

01:10:02.318 --> 01:10:05.613
- Can you see the ocean from here?
- No.

01:10:06.876 --> 01:10:10.130
My friend Ana wanted me to help
her convince her father that...

01:10:10.367 --> 01:10:12.620
he should pick up his wife
at the seaside.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.183
Seems to me like she really needs him.

01:10:57.568 --> 01:10:59.612
Prepare the patient now please.

01:10:59.709 --> 01:11:01.287
Uh huh.

01:11:24.183 --> 01:11:25.935
Are we there yet?

01:11:26.243 --> 01:11:29.357
- We're almost there.
- It's almost five o'clock.

01:11:29.382 --> 01:11:32.635
That's when the doctor a-a-applies
his t-t-treatments.

01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:35.065
Tickets in hand please, if you could.

01:11:40.374 --> 01:11:42.472
Your tickets if you'd be so...

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.082
Huh?

01:11:47.828 --> 01:11:50.000
Hey guys, look what's in here.

01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:14.345
Please allow me, beautiful.

01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:52.107
The... the weather... the weather
is g-getting w-worse.

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:17.776
Mommy!

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.236
Ana!

01:13:27.928 --> 01:13:31.494
Ana. Hold my hand. Hurry up!

01:13:31.519 --> 01:13:34.188
Stop the doctor!

01:13:40.808 --> 01:13:43.363
Hmmm... all right then.

01:13:43.672 --> 01:13:49.123
Now let's do away with that horrible
fire monster forever.

01:13:52.905 --> 01:13:54.987
- Mommy!
- Ana!

01:13:55.386 --> 01:13:56.831
Ah ha.

01:13:56.982 --> 01:14:00.319
We'll erase the girl from your
mind as well.

01:14:00.344 --> 01:14:04.139
- Where's your father?
- I don't know, he didn't come.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.937
Have we reached the city?

01:14:15.663 --> 01:14:16.983
Wait for me here.

01:14:17.016 --> 01:14:18.110
Uh huh.

01:14:19.693 --> 01:14:20.944
Carmen!

01:14:23.682 --> 01:14:26.726
- I've come for my wife.
- You can't see her now.

01:14:26.799 --> 01:14:28.801
She's getting her treatment
from the doctor.

01:14:29.956 --> 01:14:32.208
Wait sir, listen.

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.164
They're too tight Mommy.

01:14:37.426 --> 01:14:39.387
Just keep on trying then Ana.

01:14:40.096 --> 01:14:43.557
What is it that Ana is trying to do madam?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.812
Shhh. You're just making it
worse for yourself.

01:14:48.132 --> 01:14:50.051
Don't talk to me anymore.

01:14:50.272 --> 01:14:52.983
You've got to accept what happened Mommy.

01:14:53.025 --> 01:14:54.026
Ana...

01:14:55.259 --> 01:14:58.220
It's time to say goodbye to Ana.

01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:05.754
Carmen?

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:06.919
Daddy?

01:15:06.968 --> 01:15:08.386
Over here.

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.837
Richard, over here.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.193
Hey you. This is unacceptable.
Get out of here.

01:15:18.272 --> 01:15:21.192
What are you doing to my wife?
Let her go!

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:24.093
Forgive me. Forgive me for leaving
you here darling.

01:15:25.949 --> 01:15:29.279
You are not allowed to interrupt
the treatment.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.629
I have your written authorization!

01:15:41.157 --> 01:15:43.680
Let me go. Let me go.

01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:46.690
Alright boys, we'll cure them both.

01:15:46.753 --> 01:15:47.745
At once.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:50.487
Tie him to the chair immediately.

01:16:06.223 --> 01:16:11.312
You can also benefit greatly from a
few electrical discharges.

01:16:11.353 --> 01:16:14.523
To placate that aggression.

01:16:14.815 --> 01:16:18.110
You can't do this to us without
our consent doctor.

01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:22.768
When the relative responsible
for one of our patients...

01:16:22.853 --> 01:16:25.887
also loses hold of his reason...

01:16:26.485 --> 01:16:29.363
it is our moral duty to assist him.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:31.788
No!

01:17:00.637 --> 01:17:03.181
C'mon. We've got to get them out of there.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.139
You go! We'll take care of the flying ??

01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:10.005
B-b-but how shall we do it?

01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:12.738
I know who can lend us a hand.

01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:16.230
We shall bid farewell to Poncho...

01:17:16.725 --> 01:17:20.172
who now feels prepared to rejoin
the outside world.

01:17:20.214 --> 01:17:22.591
Don't you Mr. Poncho?

01:17:22.633 --> 01:17:25.344
Uh yes. Yes.

01:17:26.371 --> 01:17:28.059
Mr. Poncho?

01:17:28.313 --> 01:17:29.814
There, there.

01:17:30.435 --> 01:17:32.741
There. There.

01:17:34.979 --> 01:17:36.731
Now listen here fruitcake.

01:17:36.772 --> 01:17:41.068
After all those nights of insomia, within the
padded walls of this looney bin madhouse...

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.684
who's the only one that has
never left your side?

01:17:43.771 --> 01:17:44.888
Who!

01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:46.374
You?

01:17:46.575 --> 01:17:48.150
And in your times of crisis...

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:51.166
who was the one true friend who
stayed by your side?

01:17:51.191 --> 01:17:52.723
- You.
- Well now.

01:17:52.817 --> 01:17:54.389
Now I need you to help me.

01:17:54.422 --> 01:17:56.987
And you'd better help me out now
because if you don't...

01:17:57.126 --> 01:18:00.068
I swear I'll go to you each and every day
and every hour...

01:18:00.113 --> 01:18:02.586
no matter where ??.

01:18:02.756 --> 01:18:06.217
No, no!

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.335
Let there be...

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:43.056
You shall not lay a claw on this lady...

01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:45.189
because I care for her.

01:18:45.214 --> 01:18:47.187
I truly care for her.

01:18:47.366 --> 01:18:49.785
Even if she can't really stand me.

01:18:53.888 --> 01:18:55.989
Let me tell you something brother...

01:18:56.036 --> 01:18:58.333
even though you don't care much.

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:00.502
For that cupcake right there...

01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:03.650
I'd do anything in the world. Do
you hear that?

01:19:03.734 --> 01:19:07.404
In fact, from this moment on...

01:19:07.597 --> 01:19:09.015
...I'm going dry.

01:19:09.574 --> 01:19:13.603
I will never drink again... ever again.

01:19:33.806 --> 01:19:35.888
Okay what else have you got? What else
you got?

01:19:35.974 --> 01:19:37.982
You must be a big flaming chicken.

01:19:50.573 --> 01:19:53.018
Daniel. Over here.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:57.186
Take these straps off.

01:19:57.211 --> 01:19:58.835
Stop fighting me.

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.263
Get over here.

01:20:18.984 --> 01:20:20.068
Get out.

01:20:20.144 --> 01:20:23.564
Go back to your rooms
or I'll give you an injection.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.400
Can't you hear me?

01:20:26.645 --> 01:20:29.440
Manu, prepare the hypodermic.

01:20:30.151 --> 01:20:31.236
Manu!

01:20:31.803 --> 01:20:35.265
Manu? Hey what, what are you doing?

01:20:35.451 --> 01:20:37.787
Be careful. This isn't a toy.

01:20:37.828 --> 01:20:41.958
These are delicate devices, so be careful.
They could be damaged.

01:20:41.999 --> 01:20:44.919
And you might all get seriously hurt.

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:25.293
I have to go.

01:21:28.254 --> 01:21:31.299
No, don't leave me alone.

01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:33.384
You won't ever be alone.

01:21:36.304 --> 01:21:37.346
Ana...

01:21:38.592 --> 01:21:41.011
I'll miss you too Mommy.

01:21:42.994 --> 01:21:44.358
Goodbye.

01:21:56.174 --> 01:21:58.231
Leave us alone!

01:22:04.391 --> 01:22:05.792
No!

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.133
I can do anything I want.
I can do anything I want.

01:22:14.592 --> 01:22:16.427
I can do anything I want.

01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:39.495
Why are you bothering my Mommy?

01:22:39.992 --> 01:22:42.036
Pick on someone your own size!

01:22:42.078 --> 01:22:45.081
I'm imaginary too and I'm not
afraid of you!

01:22:58.886 --> 01:23:00.721
Come after me monster.

01:23:00.848 --> 01:23:02.243
Come on!

01:23:02.765 --> 01:23:03.974
Over there.

01:23:09.837 --> 01:23:11.221
Right now.

01:23:34.839 --> 01:23:36.382
No!

01:24:18.781 --> 01:24:20.157
The monster...

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.316
Is it there?

01:24:26.799 --> 01:24:28.176
It disappeared.

01:24:29.894 --> 01:24:31.479
You did it Ana.

01:24:35.381 --> 01:24:36.632
And Ana?

01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:55.124
We shall remember her until the
e-e-end of time.

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.465
She taught me to see true love.

01:24:59.757 --> 01:25:02.676
And I never got the chance to thank her.

01:25:07.178 --> 01:25:08.849
Thank you too Ana.

01:25:11.153 --> 01:25:12.905
Thank you for everything.

01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.330
Run Mommy run.

01:25:31.747 --> 01:25:33.082
Ana.

01:25:40.297 --> 01:25:42.424
Run and don't stop.

01:25:43.552 --> 01:25:44.804
Wait for me.

01:25:46.530 --> 01:25:47.823
Ana!

01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:50.017
I'm gonna beat you. I'm gonna beat you.

01:25:50.224 --> 01:25:51.767
I beat you.

01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:54.955
Now you've really asked for it. You've
really asked for it.

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.404
No, no.

01:26:05.262 --> 01:26:08.851
All three of us together Mommy, finally.

01:26:16.346 --> 01:26:17.822
What is that?

01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:22.166
Don't you worry about me.
I'm alright.

01:26:22.233 --> 01:26:23.359
Ana?

01:26:23.549 --> 01:26:26.468
I love you Mommy. I love you.

01:26:32.748 --> 01:26:33.791
Ana?

01:26:37.368 --> 01:26:41.163
Richard... Richard!

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.896
I was dreaming about Ana.

01:26:49.033 --> 01:26:50.076
Again really?

01:26:55.289 --> 01:26:56.457
Daniel.

01:26:58.128 --> 01:26:59.171
Daniel!

01:27:09.914 --> 01:27:11.379
Are you alright?

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:14.527
I'm fine, how about you?

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.132
You know we don't like you coming
up here when you're alone.

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:19.558
How does it look?

01:27:22.107 --> 01:27:23.483
Richard.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.151
Daniel!

01:27:26.224 --> 01:27:27.850
Come down to breakfast!

01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:29.977
Coming!

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.104
Ana?

01:27:53.683 --> 01:27:55.601
I love you too Ana.

01:27:59.103 --> 01:28:00.563
Hello Crash!

01:28:01.190 --> 01:28:03.466
You gotta tell me how you get into
people's dreams.

01:28:03.537 --> 01:28:05.669
I try but I just can't do it.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.140
What are you doing here. It's time now.

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.047
The bride and groom are waiting for you!

01:28:11.072 --> 01:28:13.950
Rosie told me to make sure that Ana
doesn't miss the wedding.

01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:18.122
Hello Ana. It's been such a long time.

01:28:18.163 --> 01:28:20.783
- Hello.
- And where did you get her from now?

01:28:20.808 --> 01:28:24.853
Where else. Her mother's head.
As always. Shall we?

01:28:25.211 --> 01:28:27.547
- Let's go.
- Th-th-then let's go now.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:38.730
So when do we finish my room, huh?

01:28:39.038 --> 01:28:41.250
With your help maybe it can
happen today.

01:28:41.423 --> 01:28:42.524
Really?

01:28:42.573 --> 01:28:45.784
And if we finish it,
can I sleep there?

01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:47.226
Of course you can do it.

01:28:47.251 --> 01:28:50.630
And Crash can I sleep there?

01:28:50.655 --> 01:28:54.117
No. Crash will have his doghouse
near the backyard.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:58.877
- What happens if he gets bored?
- You'll go out and play with him.

01:28:59.009 --> 01:29:01.761
- Can he be inside the house?
- No.

01:29:02.218 --> 01:29:04.470
What if it rains and he gets wet?

01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:07.651
- Want some orange juice?
- Yes please.
