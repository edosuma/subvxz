you'll go flying off!

It's what Avatar Roku said.

I'm supposed to master
all four elements

01:13.580 --> 01:14.870
before that comet arrives.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Well, let's see.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.540
You pretty much mastered airbending,

01:17.620 --> 01:19.420
and that only took you 112 years.

01:19.790 --> 01:20.790
I'm sure you can master

01:20.880 --> 01:22.170
three more elements by next summer.

I haven't even started waterbending,

from the North Pole.

If you want,

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
I can try and teach you

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
some of the stuff I know.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.730
You'd do that?

We'll need to find

01:37.480 --> 01:38.650
a good source of water first.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.610
Maybe we can find a puddle
for you to splash in.

Oh, right.

Time to practice waterbending.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.550
Great. So, what am I supposed to do?

02:05.840 --> 02:07.380
You could clean the gunk

02:07.470 --> 02:08.470
out of Appa's toes.

So, while you guys
are playing in the water,

I'm supposed to be hard at work

out of a giant bison's feet?

02:35.910 --> 02:37.160
What's the meaning of this mutiny?

02:37.250 --> 02:38.870
No one told you to change course.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.000
Actually, someone did.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.420
I assure you,

02:42.500 --> 02:44.880
it is a matter of utmost importance,

02:44.960 --> 02:46.050

02:46.590 --> 02:47.880
Is it something to do with the Avatar?

02:48.420 --> 02:49.840
Even more urgent.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.130
It seems I―

02:51.220 --> 02:52.930
I've lost my lotus tile.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.600
Lotus tile?

02:55.890 --> 02:57.720
For my pai sho game.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.600
Most people think the lotus tile

02:59.680 --> 03:00.810
insignificant.

03:01.350 --> 03:04.690
But it is essential
for the unusual strategy

03:04.770 --> 03:06.520
that I employ.

03:06.610 --> 03:09.610
You've changed our course
for a stupid lotus tile?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.570
See, you, like most people,

03:11.650 --> 03:13.660
underestimate its value.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.080
Just give me 10 minutes
to check the merchants

03:16.160 --> 03:17.490
at this port of call.

03:17.580 --> 03:20.750
Hopefully, they'll have
the lotus tile in stock

03:20.830 --> 03:23.290
and I can get on with my life.

03:24.210 --> 03:25.710

You've got to do me next.

03:35.260 --> 03:36.970
( SIGHS )

03:37.510 --> 03:38.850
This is a pretty basic move,

03:38.930 --> 03:41.020
but it still took me
months to perfect.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.770
So, don't be frustrated

03:42.850 --> 03:44.150
if you don't get it right away.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.820
Just push and pull the water
like this.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.860
The key is getting
the wrist movement right.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Like this?

03:55.240 --> 03:56.570
That's almost right.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.120
If you keep practicing,

03:58.200 --> 03:59.330
I'm sure eventually―

03:59.410 --> 04:00.830
Hey, I'm bending it already!

04:01.200 --> 04:03.540
Wow! I can't believe
you got that so quickly.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.250
It took me two months
to learn that move.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.500
Well, you had to figure it out

04:07.590 --> 04:08.750
all on your own.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.460
I'm lucky enough
to have a great teacher.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.970
Thanks.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.630
So, what's next?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.340
This is a more difficult move.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.300
I call it streaming the water.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.850
It's harder than it looks,

04:21.930 --> 04:23.060
so don't be disappointed if...

04:34.030 --> 04:35.070
Nice work.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.410
Though the over-the-head
flair was unnecessary.

04:38.030 --> 04:39.030
Sorry.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.490
Well, don't stop now.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.740
Keep 'em coming.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.500
Well, I kind of know
this one other move,

04:43.960 --> 04:45.210
But it's pretty hard.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.960
I haven't even totally
figured it out yet.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.670
The idea is to create
a big, powerful wave.

the hang of that move.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.700
That's enough practicing for today.

No wonder they were
trying to hack us up.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.110

10:56.580 --> 10:58.580
They stole it from a waterbender.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.120

11:16.010 --> 11:17.220
We might as well learn from it.

on this pier.

in the entire marketplace.

11:32.910 --> 11:33.910

11:33.990 --> 11:34.990
was a complete waste of time

11:35.070 --> 11:36.370

the only thing better than

is finding something
you weren't looking for

11:49.960 --> 11:51.630

12:01.230 --> 12:03.560
Oh, that is handsome!

12:03.940 --> 12:06.310
Wouldn't it look
magnificent in the galley?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.900

12:07.980 --> 12:08.980
and the little bald monk

12:09.070 --> 12:10.570
she was traveling with.

an arrow on his head?

in teaching herself.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.900

this stupid move?!

12:49.980 --> 12:50.980
You'll get it.

12:53.650 --> 12:55.110
You've just gotta shift your weight

12:55.200 --> 12:56.450

13:05.000 --> 13:06.620
Why don't we just
throw the scroll away

13:14.760 --> 13:16.470
Oh, my gosh, Aang.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.260
I am so sorry.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.260
I don't know what came over me.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.890
But you know what?

13:21.970 --> 13:23.350
It won't happen again.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.800
Prince Zuko,

22:15.880 --> 22:17.880
you're really going to
get a kick out of this.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.640
That lotus tile
was in my sleeve the whole time!

22:23.720 --> 22:25.140
( GROWLING )

22:27.730 --> 22:28.730
( GRUNTS )

22:31.610 --> 22:32.690
KATARA: Aang,

22:32.770 --> 22:34.320
I still owe you an apology.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.740
You were just so good at waterbending

22:36.820 --> 22:38.200
without really trying.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.700
I got so competitive

22:39.780 --> 22:41.070
that I put us all in danger.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.820
I'm sorry.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.740
That's ok, Katara.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.790
Besides, who needs
that stupid scroll anyway?

22:47.870 --> 22:50.080
Is that really how you feel?

22:50.170 --> 22:51.290
The scroll!

22:51.380 --> 22:53.130
First, what did you learn?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.750
Stealing is wrong.

22:56.630 --> 22:57.970
Unless it's from pirates.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.420
AANG: Ha ha ha!

22:59.510 --> 23:00.630
Good one, Katara.
