WEBVTT

00:21.068 --> 00:23.445
First time I've ever blown my way
out of a store.

00:23.612 --> 00:26.448
Yeah, Marko.
Biggest score we ever made.

00:26.615 --> 00:29.034
I'm loving it.

00:30.118 --> 00:33.121
I'm loving there's no Spider-Man
down here to cramp our style.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.874
Didn't know you had any style.

00:36.041 --> 00:37.876
Hi, boys.

00:40.087 --> 00:44.132
Two bags full of cash,
and we lost them. I can't believe it.

00:44.299 --> 00:48.554
I can't believe we lost
to that pathetic little web-creep again.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.805
Bail's been paid.

00:49.972 --> 00:52.849
Guess pond scum can have friends.
Who knew?

01:05.153 --> 01:07.823
Get in, boys.

01:10.242 --> 01:14.288
Oh, and welcome to the big time.

02:24.149 --> 02:27.778
You talking to me?
Then say hello to my webs.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.702
Peter?

02:35.869 --> 02:39.831
Just a sec, Aunt May, I--
I gotta straighten up a bit.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.127
My goodness, you did straighten up.

02:44.294 --> 02:47.464
I've never seen this room so spare.

02:47.631 --> 02:51.635
Where's the clutter?
Shoved under the bed as usual?

02:51.802 --> 02:56.306
Hey, I'm not 5 anymore.
I don't need to resort to tricks.

02:57.933 --> 03:01.269
Well, I'm impressed, Peter.
And not just with the room.

03:01.436 --> 03:04.564
You have been very good about
getting home by your new curfew.

03:04.731 --> 03:08.360
And as a reward,
I've decided to restore the old rules.

03:08.527 --> 03:12.280
You can stay out until 10
and call if you're gonna be late.

03:12.447 --> 03:13.949
- What's that?
- What, this?

03:14.116 --> 03:18.120
This is just a flyer
for the Midtown High Fall Formal.

03:18.286 --> 03:21.206
But I'm not going. I don't have a date.

03:21.373 --> 03:26.837
Oh, Peter,
you lead such a sheltered life.

03:27.462 --> 03:30.507
Why not ask Anna Watson's niece,
Mary Jane?

03:30.674 --> 03:33.218
<i>Miss Wonderful Personality?</i>

03:33.844 --> 03:37.764
Yeah, let me think on that.
Right now, I gotta get to school.

03:58.577 --> 04:01.788
- What about O'Hirn?
- This is a solo job.

04:01.955 --> 04:05.167
And the Big Man's
had his eye on you, Marko.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.836
The Big Man? Do I get to meet him?

04:08.003 --> 04:11.131
No one meets the Big Man.

04:20.599 --> 04:24.644
Okay, I'm here with my two best friends
and neither's talking to me.

04:24.811 --> 04:27.731
- Should I change seats?
- Oh, don't be a doof.

04:27.898 --> 04:31.526
So you couldn't help me
with my calc test. I'm over it.

04:31.693 --> 04:34.571
<i>Morning. Coach Smith here
with a quick announcement.</i>

04:34.738 --> 04:36.990
<i>After the injury
of our starting tight end...</i>

04:37.157 --> 04:40.660
<i>...and the academic suspension
of our backup...</i>

04:40.827 --> 04:43.914
<i>...the Midtown Mustangs
will be holding three days of tryouts...</i>

04:44.080 --> 04:45.415
<i>...starting this afternoon.</i>

04:45.582 --> 04:48.293
Perfect. I am so there.

04:48.460 --> 04:52.172
Harry, you know I'm all about being
the encouraging gal pal...

04:52.339 --> 04:56.218
...but the words, "catastrophic
bone breakage" do come to mind here.

04:56.384 --> 04:58.762
Yeah, Harr,
you seen the size of those guys?

04:58.929 --> 05:02.974
Come on, if you're worried, how about
a little moral support? Try outwith me.

05:15.237 --> 05:17.948
I'll pass. No pun intended.

05:19.324 --> 05:22.494
- Hey, Kong. Osborn's trying out.
- Cool.

05:22.661 --> 05:25.413
- Cool?
- Hey, I need another tackling dummy.

05:25.622 --> 05:26.957
Broke my last one.

05:31.628 --> 05:35.966
Hey, Harr, on second thought,
tryouts, I got your back.

05:43.849 --> 05:47.811
So, doc, what's with the arms?

05:47.978 --> 05:49.145
These?

05:49.354 --> 05:53.817
Well, they allow me to multitask,
manipulate difficult objects...

05:53.984 --> 05:56.778
...and, of course,
maintain a safe distance.

05:56.945 --> 05:58.947
You need a safe distance?
What about me?

05:59.114 --> 06:03.076
Actually, there are concerns.

06:06.746 --> 06:09.249
Marko, relax.

06:09.416 --> 06:13.587
Procedure's simple, painless
and totally worth it.

06:14.129 --> 06:15.672
Show him.

06:16.339 --> 06:18.925
Yes, well, the subject is infused...

06:19.092 --> 06:22.095
...with <i>millions of microscopic
silicon granules...</i>

06:22.262 --> 06:24.848
<i>...creating subdermal silicon armor.</i>

06:25.015 --> 06:29.269
Now, in theory, he'll be able
to pass through metal detectors...

06:29.436 --> 06:33.857
...well, undetected,
and he'll be impervious.

06:34.024 --> 06:36.818
"Impervious"? What?
Is that a good thing?

06:36.985 --> 06:40.780
Yeah. Means nothing and no one
can hurt you...

06:40.947 --> 06:44.200
...including Spider-Man.

06:49.623 --> 06:51.833
All right, ladies, listen up.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.046
I only have room for two of you
on the team: one starter, one backup.

06:56.212 --> 06:58.840
Don't worry, Brown, you're in.
We'll make sure of it.

06:59.007 --> 07:01.927
All right, helmets on.
Let's play some football.

08:01.277 --> 08:04.781
Some real talent out there.
Your buddy, Hobie, yeah, he's good.

08:04.990 --> 08:08.743
But those two skinny little juniors,
they might just be better.

08:08.910 --> 08:11.079
They're sure giving King Kong
a rough time.

08:11.246 --> 08:13.623
- They're not the only ones.
- Grow up, Kenny.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.292
Why would I date someone
too immature to play fair?

08:16.459 --> 08:18.753
- But Glory--
- I'm serious.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.756
Cut it out or we're history.

08:27.262 --> 08:31.808
Please, Mr. Osborn.
This lab, it was assembled so rapidly.

08:31.975 --> 08:36.604
And the equipment, it's substandard.
At the least, I need more time.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.773
The experiment's never
really been tested.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.985
This is the test.

08:42.152 --> 08:44.821
Press the button, doctor.

09:02.505 --> 09:04.340
Oh, God.

09:04.591 --> 09:06.676
Stop. Stop it now.

09:12.766 --> 09:14.976
Stop!

09:15.185 --> 09:18.354
The magnetic field directing the silicon
is overloading.

09:18.521 --> 09:20.690
- We must abort.
- Not yet.

09:42.212 --> 09:45.215
What have we done? What do we do?

09:45.381 --> 09:48.510
We sweep up and we try again.

09:48.676 --> 09:51.387
Wait. What's going on in there?

10:12.534 --> 10:16.412
No!

10:22.127 --> 10:24.963
What have you done to me?

10:25.130 --> 10:28.842
I know you're in there! Answer me!

10:29.509 --> 10:32.137
Hey, Mr. Sandman.

10:32.303 --> 10:34.472
Chill.

10:40.145 --> 10:44.816
There you go. You got your sand legs,
your sand clothes.

10:46.401 --> 10:49.154
Hey, and now you're in color.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.240
- See, it's not so bad.
- Not so bad?

10:52.407 --> 10:55.493
Stuff happens. End result's the same.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.165
You got power no one else got.
Not even Spider-Man.

11:00.331 --> 11:01.833
Now, you can get revenge...

11:02.000 --> 11:05.211
...for all those times
the web-head put you behind bars.

11:05.378 --> 11:09.174
Yeah. No, wait.
Revenge is for chumps.

11:09.340 --> 11:12.760
I don't care about Spider-Man.
All I ever wanted was the big score.

11:12.927 --> 11:16.514
- And now I got the power to get it.
- Now, listen, you little nobody--

11:16.681 --> 11:18.683
Hey, Flint Marko was a nobody.

11:18.850 --> 11:21.394
But everyone will know
the name Sandman.

11:27.317 --> 11:28.860
You're taking this calmly.

11:29.027 --> 11:32.530
I thought Big Man wanted
a super-villain to fight Spider-Man.

11:32.697 --> 11:35.200
Big Man wanted the bug distracted.

11:35.366 --> 11:37.619
Think that boy won't make
a good distraction...

11:39.037 --> 11:41.206
...you haven't been paying attention.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.251
Yeah, I could get used to this.

11:45.418 --> 11:48.546
I mean, sure,
I went a little arachnobatic on Kong.

11:48.713 --> 11:50.089
But it's not like I cheated.

11:50.256 --> 11:54.260
No one yells at Flash
when he uses his natural talents.

12:00.475 --> 12:05.104
Oh, man, Marko, this is so getting old.
Where's your partner?

12:06.231 --> 12:09.567
Don't think I need a partner anymore.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.618
- What just--?
- Happened?

12:18.785 --> 12:23.081
- I happened. Sandman happened.
- No, that's just wrong.

12:47.105 --> 12:50.817
No, no, no.
Not a good time to run out of web--

13:00.618 --> 13:02.954
Let me guess,
you were on a reality show.

13:03.121 --> 13:06.124
<i>Changing Faces
or Completely Ridiculous Makeovers?</i>

13:06.291 --> 13:07.333
Nice, huh?

13:07.500 --> 13:10.003
The Big Man did this to me
to get to you.

13:10.169 --> 13:14.799
- The Big Man? Who's the Big Man?
- That-- That's need to know only.

13:14.966 --> 13:18.845
Look, cleaning your clock's been fun,
but I got banks to rob.

13:27.979 --> 13:30.356
Oh, man, my money.

13:33.860 --> 13:37.155
<i>Forget football. Soon as school's out,
I'm webbing up Sandman once--</i>

13:37.322 --> 13:39.240
Hey, Petey. Nice moves yesterday.

13:39.449 --> 13:43.661
Heard it's down to you, Harry
and Hobie Brown. Good luck.

13:49.167 --> 13:53.004
<i>Course, Sandman will still be around
after tryouts, right?</i>

14:50.770 --> 14:53.398
That was a good day.
I haven't made a final decision...

14:53.564 --> 14:57.402
...but I'm leaning toward Parker as our
starter, with Osborn as second string.

14:57.568 --> 15:00.571
Anyone wants to change my mind
has one more day of tryouts to do it.

15:00.738 --> 15:04.617
Unbelievable.
The geeks are inheriting the Earth.

15:10.248 --> 15:14.085
- You didn't even want to try out.
- Yeah. Who knew?

15:14.252 --> 15:15.670
This was my dream, Pete.

15:15.837 --> 15:17.839
You're already the smartest kid
in school.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.007
- You really need this too?
- Harry, I--

15:20.174 --> 15:22.844
Guys, we're headed
to the Silver Spoon. Wanna come?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.846
Sure. My treat.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.764
Hey, if you insist.

15:27.348 --> 15:29.267
Rain check.

15:36.107 --> 15:39.360
Say, aren't you football star
Peter Parker?

15:39.569 --> 15:42.363
How come you aren't hanging
with your new friends?

15:42.572 --> 15:45.324
Because I like my old friends?

15:45.575 --> 15:47.952
I know you think
I've been acting like a jerk.

15:48.119 --> 15:51.122
I put taking photos for the <i>Bugle</i>
before more important things.

15:51.289 --> 15:55.042
But I promise it won't happen again.
So can you forgive me already?

15:55.209 --> 15:58.713
You're forgiven. It would take too long
to train anyone else.

15:58.880 --> 16:03.134
So, Peter, the dance
is only a few days away and--

16:03.301 --> 16:07.388
- I asked Miss Brant from the <i>Bugle.</i>
- Wow, that's great.

16:07.597 --> 16:11.476
You don't actually call her "Miss Brant"
in person, do you?

16:11.642 --> 16:14.312
Never mind.
I'm sure you two will have the best--

16:14.479 --> 16:18.399
- She turned me down.
- Well, she is totally missing out.

16:18.608 --> 16:21.319
- Besides, she's not the only girl who--
- Doesn't matter.

16:21.486 --> 16:23.821
There's no way I'm going near
that stupid formal.

16:23.988 --> 16:27.158
Right. Stupid formal.

16:31.162 --> 16:34.999
I gotta go because the <i>Bugle</i>
will want photos.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.837
Except I just promised you I wouldn't
put the <i>Bugle</i> before our friendship.

16:40.004 --> 16:44.008
- It's okay. Just be careful.
- Thanks, Gwen. You totally rock.

16:44.175 --> 16:46.886
Glad you noticed.

16:53.351 --> 16:55.520
Surprise.

16:58.773 --> 17:02.151
Gee, web-head,
if I'm over here, who's driving?

17:17.208 --> 17:18.751
Go!

17:40.982 --> 17:43.818
Good thing
I refilled the web-shooters.

17:44.652 --> 17:47.446
All webbed up and nowhere to go.

17:47.613 --> 17:50.032
Who do you think I am? Flint Marko?

17:54.495 --> 17:56.706
Spider tricks don't work
on the Sandman.

17:56.872 --> 18:00.167
But do sand tricks work
on the Spider-Man?

18:00.334 --> 18:02.461
Oh, this can't be good.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.012
And then what happened?

18:11.178 --> 18:14.974
Okay, so then he gets in
a second accident at the tollbooth.

18:15.141 --> 18:17.018
Worst chauffer we ever had.

18:17.184 --> 18:19.478
I thought my dad was gonna,
like, pop a vessel.

18:19.645 --> 18:21.689
Maybe the chauffer
wasn't the problem.

18:21.856 --> 18:25.318
Wow, who knew
being super-rich was so tough?

18:25.484 --> 18:28.237
Yeah. Well, I-- I mean, no. I mean--

18:28.404 --> 18:30.740
It's okay. I'm just teasing you.

18:30.906 --> 18:32.241
Better get used to it.

18:32.408 --> 18:34.702
Way you played today,
you and Parker both...

18:34.869 --> 18:37.204
...you'll be spending more time
with this crowd.

18:37.371 --> 18:42.043
Yeah, but not tonight.
Come on, Glory, let's hit it.

18:42.335 --> 18:43.377
Sorry.

18:48.174 --> 18:50.551
Kenny. What are you, 6?

18:50.718 --> 18:53.596
Look, I wanted to be your girlfriend,
not your babysitter.

18:53.804 --> 18:57.266
Oh, Glory, it was a joke. You're not
gonna break up with me again?

18:57.433 --> 18:58.726
What do you think?

18:58.934 --> 19:02.063
Come on, Harry. Take me home.

19:04.899 --> 19:07.526
<i>This ain't a problem we can fix.</i>

19:07.902 --> 19:10.071
Cordon off the area.

19:10.321 --> 19:12.907
And pray Spidey
can handle the freak.

19:17.244 --> 19:19.872
You know, I hadn't planned
on coming after you.

19:20.039 --> 19:23.959
But you're determined to be the cloud
hanging over my sunny, sandy beach.

19:24.126 --> 19:27.588
Time to change the weather forever.

19:38.724 --> 19:40.851
All right, Sandman.
Show me what you got.

19:42.561 --> 19:44.772
Better yet, I'll show you.

19:48.651 --> 19:50.319
Wow, you sure showed me.

19:50.486 --> 19:53.239
The hammer thing's getting old, pal.

20:00.246 --> 20:04.500
I could keep this up all night.
Can you, web-head?

20:28.315 --> 20:33.154
I guess if I'm gonna win,
I'll have to take a dive, literally.

20:43.998 --> 20:45.499
It's over, Spider-Man.

20:45.666 --> 20:48.878
When you were the only one
with powers, you had me beat.

20:49.044 --> 20:52.506
But now King Sandman
reigns supreme.

20:52.673 --> 20:54.341
Your Majesty.

20:56.302 --> 20:58.512
Allow me to build a statue
in your honor.

21:04.810 --> 21:06.854
Michelangelo, eat your heart out.

21:20.534 --> 21:22.203
Hey, Mom. Dad.

21:22.369 --> 21:24.413
Harry. What happened to you?

21:24.580 --> 21:28.209
And what's with the helmet?
Going to a costume party?

21:28.375 --> 21:29.919
I'm trying out for the team.

21:30.085 --> 21:32.838
Football?
Not really your strong suit, is it?

21:37.718 --> 21:40.554
Guess we'll find out tomorrow.

22:02.993 --> 22:05.830
Here's what we got:
Osborn, you're first string.

22:05.996 --> 22:08.624
Brown, second.
Parker, maybe next year.

22:08.791 --> 22:11.877
Yeah, if we're desperate.

22:15.631 --> 22:18.968
I guess yesterday

22:22.805 --> 22:25.516
<i>Hey, if I wanted all the glory,
I wouldn't wear a mask.</i>

22:27.768 --> 22:31.230
<i>So Harry gets his dream,
and I watch from the sidelines.</i>

22:31.397 --> 22:33.107
Ice cream?

22:33.274 --> 22:36.902
<i>Of course, that has its benefits too.</i>
