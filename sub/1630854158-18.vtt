whip up these psychos

09:58.599 --> 10:00.765
into a full-fledged fan war?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.249
-Yeah.
-Cool.

10:02.251 --> 10:06.663
You psychos heard my sister.
It's war.

10:06.665 --> 10:08.064

D'oh!

10:20.362 --> 10:22.287
(grunts, sighs)

10:22.289 --> 10:25.272
The winner is Ashlee Starling.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.292
-(grunts) Yoink!
-BOTH: Oh!

10:32.874 --> 10:34.633
Huh? (exclaiming)

10:37.638 --> 10:39.863
Ew, carrot.

10:39.865 --> 10:42.382
Glitter war is sparkly hell.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.868
Mrs. Simpson, are you proud
of what your husband

10:44.870 --> 10:46.460
-has done to this town?
-No.

10:46.462 --> 10:48.037
The thing I hate most
about armies,

10:48.039 --> 10:51.816
fan or otherwise, is the mess.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.968
I love my husband,
but I disagree

10:53.970 --> 10:55.320
with him about Ashlee.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.731
I listened to one of her albums.
It was great.

10:58.733 --> 11:02.643
She sure knows which of
her boyfriends were bad for her.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.721
-All of them.
-(laughs)

11:04.723 --> 11:07.832
You heard it here first.
Ashlee Starling is great,

11:07.834 --> 11:10.151
but not as great
as BTS or their fans,

11:10.153 --> 11:13.129
-who are sane and perfect.
-Mm-hmm.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.006
I got the family size.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.900
This'll make enough slime
to fill his toilet

11:16.902 --> 11:18.568
and his secret toilet.

11:18.570 --> 11:19.827
Maybe we could work in

11:19.829 --> 11:22.238
Tabasco toilet paper.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.924
-Whoa, that's messed-up.
-Thanks. (chuckles)

11:24.926 --> 11:26.926
I'm learning from you.
(chuckles)

11:26.928 --> 11:29.170
This has been really great.

11:29.172 --> 11:31.597
Who would have thought
that you and I could connect

11:31.599 --> 11:34.442
-on such a deep level?
-(phone dings)

11:35.437 --> 11:37.011
-You're out of the group.
-What?!

11:37.030 --> 11:40.848
Yeah. Mackenzie said you weren't
excited enough to meet her dog.

11:40.850 --> 11:43.535
But-but who names
their dog Greg?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.928
That's a man name.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.854
And why didn't you
stand up for me?

11:46.856 --> 11:48.097
Meh, sheroes before bros.

11:48.099 --> 11:52.101
-I'll tell dad everything.
-If you do,

11:52.103 --> 11:55.104
then I'll show him
your little notebook of pranks.

11:55.106 --> 11:57.790
Dad would be so surprised
to learn that the handsome pills

11:57.792 --> 12:00.777
he's been taking are actually

12:00.779 --> 12:03.037
the dog's heartworm medication.

12:03.039 --> 12:04.705
-Oh...
-(doorbell rings)

12:04.707 --> 12:07.450
(gasps)

12:07.452 --> 12:08.226
It's the Wingmen!

12:08.395 --> 12:12.379
Ashlee Starling's
live-in aerialists.

12:12.381 --> 12:13.481
Oh!

12:15.569 --> 12:17.902
Aah!

12:17.904 --> 12:20.129
What?
What happened?

12:20.131 --> 12:22.815
Ashlee Starling wants
to have dinner with me.

12:22.817 --> 12:24.817
Aah!

12:24.819 --> 12:26.803
She sent a dress for me to wear.

12:26.805 --> 12:29.914
Whee! (grunts)

12:29.916 --> 12:33.159
"Hope this fits you, Marge"?

12:33.161 --> 12:35.903
(gasps) It's for me?

12:35.905 --> 12:37.814
She must have heard me tell
Kent Brockman

12:37.816 --> 12:39.758
that I listened
to her song once.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.818
What? I mean...

12:41.820 --> 12:44.078
(laughs)

12:44.080 --> 12:47.581
I have been a very dedicated fan

12:47.583 --> 12:48.433
since I was four,

12:48.660 --> 12:51.752
but you-- you just made
one comment.

12:51.754 --> 12:53.087
(laughs) Good for you.

12:53.089 --> 12:57.275
I'm having dinner
with a famous person.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.928
(giggles)
I'm team Sparrow.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.263
It's Starling!

13:02.265 --> 13:05.858
As a great man once said,
"Haw-haw."

13:05.860 --> 13:09.028
I can't believe you're
having dinner with my nemesis,

13:09.030 --> 13:10.955
after all the handsome pills
I take for you.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.291
-(helicopter approaching)
-That's my ride.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.417
(gasps)

13:16.797 --> 13:18.779
Hello, Marge.

13:18.781 --> 13:21.282
-I'm Ashlee Starling.
-I know.

13:21.284 --> 13:23.968
We hired a look-alike of you
for Lisa's birthday.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.697
You're taller.
She had bigger boobs.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.882
Ooh, thank you.

13:29.884 --> 13:31.810
-Ooh, wow!
-(chuckles)

13:31.812 --> 13:34.370
It's my own line
of sparkling whiskey.

13:34.372 --> 13:35.647
Mmm, yum.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.797
Mmm, mmm. (smacks lips)

13:36.799 --> 13:39.651
Look at your sweet family.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.968
I'm sure your husband

13:40.970 --> 13:42.320
-is perfect.
-(kids growling)
-Stop it!

13:42.322 --> 13:43.062
(laughs)

13:43.214 --> 13:46.399
Homer is far from perfect.

13:46.401 --> 13:49.494
Really?
Tell me everything.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.571
Mmm, ooh.

13:51.573 --> 13:53.122
(grunting)

13:58.821 --> 14:00.213
(laughs)

14:00.215 --> 14:02.674
Ashlee said
the funniest thing at dinner.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.825
No one wants to hear
about your thrilling night

14:04.827 --> 14:05.735
with a vengeful pop diva.

14:05.737 --> 14:08.162
Lisa, sweetie, delight us

14:08.164 --> 14:10.515
with one of your little stories
about how the planet

14:10.517 --> 14:11.665
is choking on plastic.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.576
Don't "sweetie" her.

14:13.578 --> 14:15.336
She's the one behind
those Murmur Nation

14:15.338 --> 14:17.004
-attacks on you.
-(gasps)

14:17.006 --> 14:19.190
(gasps)
Lisa. Wh...

14:19.192 --> 14:22.343
But you're the one kid
I had on purpose.

14:22.345 --> 14:26.865
Well, Bart was part of it, too,
and he doesn't even like Ashlee.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.758
He did it just for the fun
of torturing you.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.184
(gasps)
You?

14:30.186 --> 14:32.945
The person I would most suspect?

14:32.947 --> 14:35.765
I never could have
seen it coming.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.042
Kids, how could you do that
to your father?

14:38.044 --> 14:41.713
What? You're the worst
betrayer of all.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.698
Dad, you should see
the video Ashlee just dropped

14:44.700 --> 14:47.051

Ashlee took the things
I told her

16:17.477 --> 16:18.959
in new-friend confidence

16:18.961 --> 16:23.314
and made it into
a bad boyfriend song.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.632
This has been quite the morning.

16:25.634 --> 16:28.561

in you, Maggie.

16:28.563 --> 16:30.062

I can't believe
they would do this to me.

16:42.410 --> 16:43.726
Hey, could I use

16:43.728 --> 16:46.987
your billion-dollar
entertainment complex

16:46.989 --> 16:49.732
to produce a diss track
to take them all down?

16:49.734 --> 16:51.067
You should be careful with that.

16:51.069 --> 16:53.327
When my dermatologist
wouldn't fly to Japan

16:53.329 --> 16:54.661
to remove a culturally
insensitive mole,

16:54.663 --> 16:57.256
I hit him with my single

16:57.258 --> 16:59.592
"Mole Check, Soul Check."

16:59.594 --> 17:01.502
It destroyed him.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.837
Do you want to do that
to your family?

17:03.839 --> 17:06.249
No. I love them.

17:06.251 --> 17:09.527
Homer, music isn't just
for dissing people.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.011
Wha...?!

17:11.013 --> 17:13.013
Why don't we make a video

17:13.015 --> 17:13.923

17:13.925 --> 17:16.759

-I will.

To stop this war,

we don't need a grand gesture.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.604

20:21.870 --> 20:24.204
I'm sorry I betrayed you.

We're all sorry
Lisa betrayed you.

20:27.452 --> 20:29.042
ALL:
Mm.

20:29.044 --> 20:30.636
LISA:
Sorry! Accident.

20:30.638 --> 20:31.804
Forgot where I put them all.

20:31.806 --> 20:33.880
There's probably more.

20:33.882 --> 20:34.899
(all coughing)

LISA:
That's gonna happen for a while.

-Mr. Simpson,

20:51.309 --> 20:54.085
the Murmur Nation has decided
to stop attacking you.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.160
My video made you think, huh?

20:55.162 --> 20:57.997
No. It was super cringe,

20:57.999 --> 21:00.240
like watching
two teachers make out.

21:00.242 --> 21:01.650
I understand. Been a pleasure
doing war with you.

21:01.652 --> 21:06.097
May psychotic super-fandom
always lend meaning

21:06.099 --> 21:09.433
to your otherwise
anonymous existence.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.659
BOY: Hmm.

21:10.661 --> 21:12.419
(all grunting)

21:12.421 --> 21:15.255
It's crazy that
I believed in someone

21:15.257 --> 21:19.092
so much that I got
swallowed up in groupthink.

21:19.094 --> 21:21.445
I know. So scary.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.764
(gasps) Oh, my God,
we're late for church!

21:23.766 --> 21:26.659
I'll get nice, crisp dollars
for the donation basket.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.204
Shh.
