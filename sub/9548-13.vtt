00:01.612 --> 00:03.469
Oh, my god, David Gitelson!

00:04.041 --> 00:06.102

00:06.456 --> 00:08.170
We're goin'all the way!

00:10.631 --> 00:12.423
All the way to the championship!

00:12.548 --> 00:15.022
- Kill the Wildcats!
- You can bet on that!

00:32.283 --> 00:33.579
What time is it?

00:33.704 --> 00:36.402
Don't ask me.
I don't even know what day it is.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.361
What's this I am sitting on?

00:40.503 --> 00:42.788
I told you,
I came straight from practice.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.962
"Classified."

00:45.842 --> 00:49.142
- What are you, a spy?
- That is top secret.

00:49.432 --> 00:52.577
You can't touch this...
Unless you're wearing one of these.

00:55.732 --> 00:58.601
- Mr. Gitelson, are we going home?
- No, I wanna go to the other club,

00:58.726 --> 01:00.190
to the after-party.

01:00.319 --> 01:03.400
Let's do it. Let's do it!
To the after-party.

01:26.548 --> 01:27.630
Hey, it's me.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.964
I got the playbook.
Yep, lookin'at it right now.

01:31.528 --> 01:34.427
Listen, we gotta move fast.
We got one hour to do this.

01:35.681 --> 01:38.168
Don't worry about that.
Just have the money ready.

01:40.756 --> 01:42.032
It's all there.

01:50.507 --> 01:52.884
You know,
normally i'd say good luck. But...

01:53.687 --> 01:55.320
you're not gonna need it now.

02:22.607 --> 02:24.522
- What's going on?
- What the hell'd you do?

02:24.647 --> 02:26.567
Did you sell me out?
What are you talking about?

02:26.692 --> 02:29.531
No, don't lie to me, man.
You know what? I'm callin'the cops.

02:31.536 --> 02:34.694
- You gonna call the police on me?
- Listen, you could cost me the game!

02:35.612 --> 02:38.673
Get up! Get up right now,
'cause i'm gonna call the police...

02:43.122 --> 02:46.247
7x13 - Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs

03:39.052 --> 03:40.720
The Condors have been there.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.389
Those guys have all been to
the playoffs. The cats are gonna choke.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.952
Richardson's the best running
back in the league.

03:46.077 --> 03:48.598
- I heard richardson was hurt.
- Yeah, he tweaked his knee!

03:48.725 --> 03:51.642
Mr. Monk said something
very interesting today about the game.

03:51.767 --> 03:54.668
- No, I didn't. I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you did. What was it again?

03:56.080 --> 03:57.136
It's just that...

03:57.527 --> 04:01.279
I saw a photo the team in a newspaper,
and it was kind of interesting.

04:01.726 --> 04:03.124
And I noticed that,

04:03.390 --> 04:06.185
if you added up all
their uniform numbers,

04:06.900 --> 04:10.042
it adds up...
to 1,000.

04:13.442 --> 04:17.055
Exactly 1,000. Anybody else notice that?
That's gotta be a good omen, right?

04:17.180 --> 04:19.176
I didn't say it was a good omen.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.021
Hey, everybody's comin'on sunday.

04:24.105 --> 04:26.360
I got a brand-new 52-inch plasma Tv.

04:26.494 --> 04:29.030
We're gonna fire up the grill,
watch the Condors kick butt.

04:29.155 --> 04:32.187
Printed out some directions.
Here ya go.

04:33.178 --> 04:35.284
Wait. What about Mr. Monk?

04:36.322 --> 04:38.384
Sure. Sorry, I didn't think...

04:38.908 --> 04:40.342
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:40.470 --> 04:42.792
Wait, no, wait.
You're talking about this sunday?

04:42.965 --> 04:46.945
I can't make it, sorry. I'm,
i'm gonna be at Summit stadium.

04:47.319 --> 04:49.687
Wait a minute.
You're gonna be at the stadium?

04:50.835 --> 04:53.458
- Why? You going to the game?
- Since when?

04:54.091 --> 04:57.802
I have to go. I promised Bob.
You know, Costas.

04:58.159 --> 05:01.147
- You know Bob Costas?
- I didn't mention that?

05:01.272 --> 05:03.821
I helped him out of a little Jam
about ten years ago.

05:03.946 --> 05:05.331
I never mentioned this?

05:05.804 --> 05:08.573
- Bob Costas? No.
- Yeah. Anyway...

05:09.302 --> 05:12.528
He, he sent me this ticket,
and I promised I might show up.

05:12.684 --> 05:16.684
It's not even a good seat.
It's... I have to sit in a box.

05:18.081 --> 05:20.968
- Sit in a box.
- A press box.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.099
A press box with Bob Costas.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.246
Look at this.
An all-access pass in here.

05:28.401 --> 05:30.555
You can go into
the locker room with that.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.762
Why would I want to
go in the locker room?

05:33.340 --> 05:34.483
Hang on.

05:36.412 --> 05:37.871
Oh, my goodness.

05:39.794 --> 05:42.161
- Monk, there are two tickets here.
- Yeah.

05:44.689 --> 05:45.969
Who you gonna take?

06:04.247 --> 06:05.703
Can I talk to you for one second?

06:05.828 --> 06:08.170
Don't worry I'm not gonna
charge you for the ticket.

06:09.425 --> 06:10.466
Here you go.

06:14.289 --> 06:17.126
Mr. Monk, you should take the captain.
He really wants to go.

06:17.624 --> 06:20.848
It'll be fun, you and Leland
at the big game, hangin'out,

06:21.034 --> 06:23.665
couple of guys.
You'll have some male bonding time.

06:23.790 --> 06:27.157
I think I'd be more comfortable
having male bonding time with you.

06:32.136 --> 06:34.401
He's gonna want to go
in the locker room.

06:42.678 --> 06:43.709
Thank you.

06:50.664 --> 06:52.358
I'm coming over to the next.

07:01.828 --> 07:05.191
- We're goin'all the way!
- Yeah, you better believe it!

07:06.083 --> 07:08.703
Come on, right here.
Help yourself!

07:08.909 --> 07:10.603
Don't mind if I do, brother.

07:10.738 --> 07:12.143
That's right, Condors!

07:15.364 --> 07:17.536
There you are.
Pretty sweet?

07:17.661 --> 07:20.621
Who are all these people,
and where are their parents?

07:20.892 --> 07:24.180
It's a tailgate party, Monk.
People get here early,

07:24.305 --> 07:26.883
and they start to party
and they get all pumped up for the game.

07:27.008 --> 07:29.448
But they're they're not
actually playing in the game.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.786
It doesn't make any sense
if you think about it.

07:31.911 --> 07:35.691
The trick is not to think about it.
You just gotta turn your mind off.

07:36.002 --> 07:38.696
- You do have an off switch, right?
- I don't think so.

07:38.901 --> 07:41.341
Well, here. You can borrow mine.

07:41.653 --> 07:45.041
- Beer. Nature's off switch.
- No, thanks. I think I'll pass.

07:47.669 --> 07:49.269
Hey! Look at this guy.

07:50.358 --> 07:52.799
Pace yourself, buddy.
It isn't even kickoff yet!

07:52.924 --> 07:56.271
Yeah. Get a... job.
Hippie.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.890
'Scuse me, sir.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.906
Could I ask you a question?

08:01.031 --> 08:02.938
- I'm taking a little survey.
- Of course.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.451
Do you have... Condor fever?

08:08.317 --> 08:11.317
- I do now. Thank you.
- Because we've got the fever!

08:32.981 --> 08:36.124
Hey, Natalie, yeah. Listen, I can't talk
right now. I'm watching the game.

08:37.004 --> 08:39.331
No. No, no, it's just me.

08:41.123 --> 08:44.471
Yeah. No, it's great. It's better than
being there. Can I talk to you later?

09:01.162 --> 09:02.713
Think I'm watchin'the game.

09:26.736 --> 09:29.716
Hey, pops! Ya feelin'it?
I said are you feeling it?!

09:31.775 --> 09:34.672
Yeah, I'm feelin'it. I'm feelin'it.
Feelin'it? I'm feelin'it!

09:48.409 --> 09:50.532
Did you enjoy civilization, Leland?

09:51.191 --> 09:55.141
I sure did. It was a hell of a run.
8,000 years.

10:55.817 --> 10:59.135
Championship game!
Great seats. Perfect weather.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.910
- It doesn't get any better than this.
- You said it! Tickets.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.880
- This is better than sex.
- Well, what isn't?

11:05.355 --> 11:09.069
Tickets. Tickets. Tickets.

11:14.704 --> 11:16.214
This will just take a minute.

11:16.771 --> 11:19.730
I wanna thank you in
advance for your patience.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.639
What'd you do?
You sealed the envelope?

11:24.543 --> 11:26.400
Almost, almost there.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.221
All right, let's fire up the grill!

11:30.941 --> 11:34.696
For god's sake, Monk, it's almost
kick-off time. Just tear it open.

11:35.747 --> 11:36.747
Gimme that.

11:39.743 --> 11:42.950
- Easy with that stuff.
- All right, all right, you big baby.

11:43.499 --> 11:46.614
- You're like a child.
- I'm not... I'm not a child.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.044
Why don't you just take someone else?
I know you want to.

11:51.150 --> 11:54.171
Come here. I don't wanna take
anybody else, Monk, okay?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.437
I'm here with you.
I'm having fun with you.

11:56.562 --> 11:58.500
Here we go.
You're gonna have a great time.

12:02.493 --> 12:03.554
What was that?

12:04.085 --> 12:07.085
- What was that?
- I don't know. Give him the tickets.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.826
No, really, we should.
We should go check that out.

12:09.951 --> 12:12.155
- Don't you think?
- We should check what out?

12:19.662 --> 12:22.089
So the playoffs get under
way at Summit stadium.

12:22.214 --> 12:23.837
It's the Wildcats and the Condors.

12:23.962 --> 12:26.485
The Condors heavily favored,
and you can see why.

12:26.610 --> 12:29.423
That pass combination of Dick
blaylock to scott sidell...

12:29.548 --> 12:30.801
You're a lucky man.

12:30.926 --> 12:33.886
If you were standing any closer,
you might have been killed.

12:34.278 --> 12:37.320
- Better get you to a hospital.
- No, no, not today, pal!

12:37.545 --> 12:39.790
I've never missed
a Condors game in my life!

12:43.412 --> 12:44.720
How's this for a bandage?

12:46.353 --> 12:48.856
Good as new.
Better than new!

12:53.132 --> 12:55.071
I guess I'm done here.

12:57.338 --> 12:58.315
What was that?

12:58.440 --> 13:01.493
That was the opening kickoff.
We're officially missing the game.

13:01.627 --> 13:03.096
Why am I not surprised?

13:10.332 --> 13:12.947
Monk, what are you doing?
With the hands... what...

13:13.380 --> 13:15.114
It's just a charcoal grill.

13:16.121 --> 13:19.297
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would it just explode?

13:20.396 --> 13:24.218
Monk, it makes perfect sense.
These things blow up all the time.

13:24.601 --> 13:26.433
First off, the kid was plastered.

13:26.596 --> 13:29.342
He dumps a half a gallon of lighter
fluid on the son of a bitch,

13:29.467 --> 13:31.029
dropped a match, and kaboom!

13:36.610 --> 13:39.304
First play of the game,
and we're already behind.

13:41.175 --> 13:42.644
That's not lighter fluid.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.673
Good, good. Good field position.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.626
That's gasoline.

14:34.089 --> 14:35.395
You son of a bitch.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.010
- I didn't do it.
- Well, at least quit smiling.

15:36.844 --> 15:38.665
Man, this is better than the grill.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.919
This is authentic.
This is how the pioneers used to eat.

15:42.582 --> 15:43.386
Cap?

15:43.533 --> 15:45.091
- What?
- We're on duty.

15:45.921 --> 15:47.288
I'm not on duty.

15:48.607 --> 15:51.259
- This is a horror show!
- Defense is killin'us, man.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.157
- They gotta get landau outta there!
- They don't have anyone else.

15:54.282 --> 15:56.829
Gitelson didn't show up today.
They were just talkin'about it.

15:56.964 --> 15:59.349
- He's MIA. Nobody knows where he's at.
- What hell is goin'on?

15:59.474 --> 16:02.567
Our backup quarterback
doesn't even show up. No, no, wait!

16:02.808 --> 16:05.794
Davy Gitelson. He's definitely here.
I saw him this morning.

16:05.929 --> 16:08.436
I asked him for his autograph.
He blew me off.

16:08.918 --> 16:11.387
- I think it was him.
- 'Scuse me. It's chet, right?

16:11.953 --> 16:15.289
We're the police, wondering if we could
ask couple of questions about the fire.

16:15.414 --> 16:19.148
- Sure.
- I found this Condors water bottle.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.844
Yes, that's absolutely correct.

16:24.494 --> 16:27.160
There was some gasoline... in it.

16:27.992 --> 16:28.808
See?

16:29.211 --> 16:31.680
Did you notice anybody
tampering with your grill?

16:31.813 --> 16:33.271
I figured.

16:33.673 --> 16:36.411
It's no big mystery.
Everybody knows who did it.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.517
- They do?
- Yeah, this guy named Cory something.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.470
He drives up from lA,
him and his moron loser friends.

16:42.595 --> 16:46.127
Legally, we can't stop him from
parkin'here. Believe me, we checked.

16:46.252 --> 16:48.208
Why would they wanna
sabotage your grill?

16:48.333 --> 16:50.574
That's a good question.
I'll tell you why.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.855
Because the Wildcats suck!

16:53.573 --> 16:55.542
You're goin'down, losers, down!

16:56.695 --> 16:58.736
Wildcats suck!

17:00.391 --> 17:04.077
We're wildcat fans, Monk.
It's a big rivalry.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.992
Two years ago,
they put a bag of bees in my car.

17:07.117 --> 17:10.390
Yeah, then his mom spat on my mom.
Then we flipped his RV.

17:11.202 --> 17:12.571
God, I love football!

17:16.696 --> 17:19.974
- I told you it was just a fan.
- I just wanna make sure.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.709
I wish we had some lab equipment.
We could dust for prints.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.792
You know what I wish?
I wish there was two of me

17:24.917 --> 17:27.252
so one of me could be out here
wasting my life with you,

17:27.377 --> 17:30.464
the other one could be in there watching
the football game with bob costas.

17:32.283 --> 17:33.532
We come in peace.

17:34.104 --> 17:36.137
- Lookin'for a fellow named Cory?
- 'Scuse me.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.035
- Can we help you?
- Yes, sir, I hope so.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.089
We're with the San Francisco
police department.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.860
We're investigating an arson
fire that took place over in section

17:43.985 --> 17:45.521
15 about a half an hour ago.

17:46.355 --> 17:47.856
That can't be a real badge?

17:48.975 --> 17:50.026
Pardon me?

17:50.572 --> 17:52.855
No self-respecting
police department in America

17:52.980 --> 17:56.724
would let Leland "hound dog"
Stottlemeyer carry a loaded weapon!

17:56.849 --> 17:59.135
Butterman!
Cory butterman!

18:00.372 --> 18:01.474
Fred! Fred!

18:04.646 --> 18:07.868
These are my buddies from high school!
This is...

18:10.110 --> 18:11.212
How you doin'?

18:12.553 --> 18:14.091
- What happened to you?
- What?

18:14.483 --> 18:16.760
You move up here,
suddenly you're a Condor fan?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.488
I haven't lived in Los Angeles
for 30 years,

18:19.613 --> 18:23.021
and as far as I'm concerned, lA.
Still doesn't have a football team.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.946
You ugly, dumb son of a bitch!

18:29.132 --> 18:30.643
This man is a friend of mine.

18:31.032 --> 18:34.298
You wanna make fun of him,
you have to make fun of me first.

18:35.449 --> 18:39.449
Monk, they're just fooling. It's okay.
They're just. It's just guy talk.

18:40.682 --> 18:43.433
Yeah, I know.
I know.

18:43.569 --> 18:46.622
That's what I was... doing.
I was that's what I was doing.

18:48.033 --> 18:51.317
What is up with those yellow teeth?
Don't you know how to brush?

18:52.776 --> 18:55.069
And you hey. The moon called...

18:55.759 --> 18:57.779
It wants all its craters back.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.792
From your... skin.
'cause you got bad skin.

19:07.261 --> 19:09.827
So, hey, what's going on?
You guys married?

19:09.952 --> 19:13.578
Oh, yeah, man.
Read 'em and weep. The party's over.

19:13.846 --> 19:16.889
- What about you, man?
- He was married, and he got divorced.

19:17.145 --> 19:18.757
And then his last girlfriend...

19:19.455 --> 19:22.006
Got arrested for murder. Right,

19:22.482 --> 19:25.850
you ugly, dumb, sad, lonely...

19:26.990 --> 19:28.806
Stupid, sad son of a...

19:30.354 --> 19:31.354
Right?

19:34.076 --> 19:35.872
- Are you really a cop?
- Yeah.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.944
Can you take care of this?

19:38.157 --> 19:40.635
- I mean, for old time's sake.
- What, a speeding ticket?

19:42.089 --> 19:44.946
Hey, that. That's 2:40 pm. Today.
That's only...

19:45.621 --> 19:47.263
That's only 35 minutes ago.

19:48.635 --> 19:50.482
Yeah, well, I'll see what I can do.

19:50.637 --> 19:54.539
So, what's all this about a fire?
If it was my kids, i'll kill'em.

19:55.076 --> 19:57.586
They've been butting heads with
these Condor fans for years.

19:57.726 --> 20:00.487
Actually, this ticket means that you
and your boys are off the hook.

20:00.612 --> 20:03.218
It happened before you got here, so

20:03.343 --> 20:07.254
- this is what we call an alibi.
- In that case, let's play some ball!

20:07.379 --> 20:10.245
Let's see if you still got
that Stottlemeyer touch!

20:10.370 --> 20:12.270
Hike it up, hike it up, hike it up!

20:13.189 --> 20:16.250
Go long! Go long, long, long, long!

20:23.493 --> 20:26.023
Still got it... Stottlemeyer touch.

20:28.468 --> 20:30.060
Go, Condors.

20:35.469 --> 20:37.061
Somebody order some pizza?

21:04.418 --> 21:06.894
Out of bounds.
That's out of bounds.

21:07.646 --> 21:08.891
God, you're blind!

21:11.667 --> 21:14.592
- What's the score?
- Down by 9.

21:16.299 --> 21:18.835
- Wait... no, 6.
- Can you hold this?

21:22.517 --> 21:23.517
Pizza!

21:24.064 --> 21:26.656
Condors heavily favored,
and you can see why.

21:26.781 --> 21:29.699
That passing combination of
dick blaylock to scott sidell...

21:29.824 --> 21:30.804
Is that blood?

21:30.936 --> 21:33.265
Yeah. It's from the evidence room,
so don't touch it.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.727
I won't touch it.
Disturbing.

21:37.419 --> 21:38.439
Thank you.

21:42.774 --> 21:44.651
I wish we had bendy straws.

21:50.118 --> 21:52.429
I can't believe I used
to run with those guys.

21:52.554 --> 21:55.188
We all got suspended one time.
We had this new vice principal.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.313
The important thing is, though,
that they have an alibi.

21:58.446 --> 22:00.038
Speeding ticket, right?

22:00.363 --> 22:02.620
Jesus, Monk, you back on that?
Give it a rest! No,

22:02.745 --> 22:05.003
I think we should pack up that grill.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.677
It was just a prank.

22:06.968 --> 22:09.519
Yeah, but what if it wasn't?
You heard the paramedic.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.326
That guy could have been killed.

22:11.657 --> 22:15.262
No, something is goin'on here.
Feels more like attempted murder.

22:17.947 --> 22:21.909
You want this to be attempted murder!
You do. Yeah, admit it!

22:22.122 --> 22:24.938
You need this to be a real case,
because that's all you know.

22:25.476 --> 22:28.677
Snoopin'around, sniffin'around.
Maybe you're right about the grill.

22:28.868 --> 22:32.215
You probably are.
But... it can wait.

22:32.806 --> 22:36.458
It can wait. We can lock the scene down.
Nobody's goin'anywhere.

22:36.583 --> 22:38.897
Tickets here.
Who needs two, who needs two?

22:39.109 --> 22:41.515
Hey, isn't that illegal?
That's illegal.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.864
It's a football game, Monk!

22:44.555 --> 22:48.106
Come on, use the off switch.
Everybody has an off switch, right?

22:49.959 --> 22:52.510
He's probably selling them
for twice what they're worth.

22:54.163 --> 22:55.326
Maybe not.

22:57.558 --> 23:00.665
All right, Leland, wait. Wait a second!
All right, look...

23:01.794 --> 23:02.825
You're right.

23:03.566 --> 23:06.209
Maybe I am overthinking it. I always do.

23:06.693 --> 23:09.511
Let's just lock down the scene,
and then we'll go to the game.

23:09.785 --> 23:11.091
The off switch?

23:12.529 --> 23:13.560
Click.

23:15.149 --> 23:15.965
Click.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.166
Changed your mind?
A woman's prerogative.

23:22.061 --> 23:25.265
- Press box, level three.
- Press box, level three!

23:26.208 --> 23:28.086
Two tickets to paradise, buddy.

23:29.766 --> 23:30.824
That ring...

23:35.352 --> 23:37.475
- What?
- This ring.

23:38.849 --> 23:42.645
- Yeah, that's the championship ring.
- Yeah, the ring. They won last year.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.344
See that?
See the stripes?

23:46.726 --> 23:49.317
- On the band.
- What about 'em?

23:57.448 --> 23:58.448
What?

24:00.542 --> 24:01.480
What?

24:16.073 --> 24:17.457
Hey, that's a real ring.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.533
This must be the player
they were talking about,

24:19.658 --> 24:22.474
- the one who didn't show up.
- David Gitelson, number 18.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.116
Captain, he's cold.

24:36.119 --> 24:39.191
- Hey, was that really Davy Gitelson?
- Yes, sir.

24:39.861 --> 24:42.890
Didn't you say you were
talking to him this morning,

24:43.376 --> 24:46.151
- and you asked him for an autograph?
- I did?

24:47.461 --> 24:48.808
I don't think so!

24:51.311 --> 24:52.786
There goes your star witness.

24:53.563 --> 24:55.053
Backup quarterback?

24:55.947 --> 24:58.471
They're not gonna say
anything till after the game.

24:58.596 --> 25:00.781
- That makes sense.
- So what do you think?

25:01.213 --> 25:03.335
- Drug deal or steroids?
- I don't know. Maybe.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.370
Here, look at this. He was sittin'on it.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.156
- The playbook!
- Playbook?

25:10.398 --> 25:12.938
Every player gets one.
The whole game plan's in here.

25:14.634 --> 25:16.509
- Keep an eye on that.
- Yeah, captain,

25:16.634 --> 25:19.320
this is Sean Metzger,
David Gitelson's personal driver.

25:19.445 --> 25:21.490
He was the last person
to see Gitelson alive.

25:21.615 --> 25:24.149
Like I told the lieutenant,
I dropped him off this morning,

25:24.274 --> 25:27.499
just like any game day.
6:15, maybe 6:20.

25:27.655 --> 25:30.491
He went into the stadium,
and that was it. I never saw him again.

25:30.634 --> 25:33.706
Did he say anything?
Did he seem worried about anything?

25:34.103 --> 25:36.940
No, sir, he was excited,
up for the game.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.686
You have a...
You have a smudge there.

25:41.885 --> 25:43.946
- What happened there?
- What happened?

25:45.003 --> 25:48.422
I don't know. Do you rember every little
smudge you ever got on your clothing?

25:49.657 --> 25:50.718
Yes, I do.

25:57.298 --> 26:01.033
- I had a beer. Is that a crime?
- No. No, it isn't.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.835
Is that it? Can I go? This whole
thing is Kinda freaking me out.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.776
I'd like to get home
and try to shake it off.

26:06.901 --> 26:09.983
Sure, you can go, but make sure
the lieutenant knows where you are.

26:12.069 --> 26:14.057
- Why are you letting him go?
- Because,

26:14.202 --> 26:16.447
I can't hold him. He's just a witness.

26:16.582 --> 26:19.380
That was a charcoal smudge
on his jacket and

26:19.607 --> 26:22.662
- the smell of gasoline on his lapel.
- You're still on the grill.

26:22.787 --> 26:23.787
What grill?

26:24.658 --> 26:27.861
Somebody's barbecue grill caught
fire right before kickoff.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.537
- So what does have to do with Gitelson?
- Good question.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.491
I think somehow they're connected.

26:34.153 --> 26:37.952
Okay, look. It's your day off.
There's nothing more you can do here.

26:38.451 --> 26:40.668
You two go and enjoy the game.
I'll take care of this.

26:40.793 --> 26:43.377
- Really?
- Turns out it's not our case anyway.

26:43.622 --> 26:46.064
Chief Brenner just called,
and he's sending a squad down.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.540
I'm supposed to stick around
and bring him up to speed.

26:49.009 --> 26:51.566
Did you hear that?
It's not our case. Let's go.

26:51.925 --> 26:52.986
Enjoy the game!

26:55.576 --> 26:57.555
Tell bob costas Randy Disher says hi.

26:58.915 --> 27:00.078
Does he know you?

27:02.459 --> 27:04.477
Well, then,
wouldn't that just confuse him?

27:05.284 --> 27:06.754
Only one way to find out.

27:09.191 --> 27:10.170
Come on.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.727
- Let's go.
- Go, Condors!

27:21.596 --> 27:24.477
- Hell.
- I'm sorry, I... I can't do it.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.801
Of course you can.
What happened to the off switch?

27:26.930 --> 27:29.455
- Come on, clickety-click, click.
- It's not working.

27:29.895 --> 27:32.294
- For the love of god.
- I think we should talk to that guy

27:32.419 --> 27:35.152
again, that chet walsh with
the funny foamy finger.

27:35.277 --> 27:37.557
Remember? He had this big, foamy finger.

27:37.686 --> 27:41.431
- I know who you mean, Monk.
- He said he saw Gitelson this morning!

27:41.709 --> 27:43.525
Look, Monk...

27:44.803 --> 27:48.803
It's out of our jurisdiction. It's not
our case. We'll just be in the way okay?

27:49.300 --> 27:53.300
Come on, every good cop knows you can't
be in it 24/7. Even god took a day off.

27:53.654 --> 27:55.833
And what day did he take off?
It was sunday.

27:55.959 --> 27:59.939
Why did he take off sunday? I tell you
why sunday. So he could watch football!

28:01.147 --> 28:03.266
Come on!
You used to be a fun guy.

28:03.391 --> 28:06.319
- I don't think so.
- Yeah. No, I remember.

28:06.447 --> 28:09.365
I remember the time when
you graduated, right?

28:09.625 --> 28:11.889
We stole that rowboat,
you, me, and trudy.

28:12.014 --> 28:14.735
And the lake patrol stopped us,
and you started speaking spanish.

28:14.885 --> 28:18.681
Now, that was funny!
That was funny! Where's that guy?

28:19.433 --> 28:20.484
Trudy died.

28:23.114 --> 28:25.601
Yes, Trudy died, but you didn't die.

28:26.173 --> 28:27.214
You're alive.

28:28.161 --> 28:29.477
Alive is a funny word.

28:32.528 --> 28:34.048
Could I have my ticket, please?

28:40.285 --> 28:41.367
Wait a second.

28:43.702 --> 28:45.722
'cause I'm goin'in there
with or without you.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.833
Hey, what's your problem?
Move the car!

28:55.958 --> 28:57.560
Move it, I'm trying to get out!

28:57.880 --> 29:00.993
It's called reverse.
You can't Miss it. It's a big "R"!

29:09.133 --> 29:11.759
- You again.
- Yes, sir. Me again.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.958
You're missing the game.

29:14.570 --> 29:17.294
Maybe the real game is out
here in the parking lot.

29:17.445 --> 29:19.098
Have you been siphoning gas?

29:19.232 --> 29:21.132
From my own car?
Why would I do that?

29:21.978 --> 29:24.516
- I don't know. You tell me.
- No.

29:25.215 --> 29:27.562
- You tell me.
- No you tell me.

29:29.966 --> 29:33.312
I don't know what you're talkin'about?
They said I could leave, so I'm leaving.

29:33.481 --> 29:36.146
We had an explosion here today.
The guy was burned.

29:36.579 --> 29:38.201
Name was chet walsh.

29:40.043 --> 29:42.513
- Never heard of him.
- Football Jersey.

29:42.805 --> 29:45.743
Big Condors fan.
Drunk, yelling all the time.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.834
It's a tailgate party.
You're describing everybody here.

29:48.959 --> 29:50.709
I'm pretty sure you know this guy...

29:50.861 --> 29:52.944
'cause you tried to kill
him about an hour ago.

29:53.980 --> 29:56.102
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

29:57.173 --> 29:58.585
You don't know much, do you?

30:00.668 --> 30:03.219
Would you move away from the car,
please? I'm going home.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.381
Sean Metzger!

30:16.833 --> 30:19.560
You can try and leave this stadium.
You can drive away...

30:20.304 --> 30:22.080
But you're not really going anywhere.

30:23.048 --> 30:26.293
The wheels of justice
may turn slowly, but...

30:28.841 --> 30:30.025
Sooner or later...

30:34.365 --> 30:35.365
They always...

30:37.371 --> 30:38.330
Wind up...

30:41.292 --> 30:42.698
What was the question again?

30:42.823 --> 30:44.805
You said you were here
about 6:30 this morning.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.649
You saw Davy Gitelson
coming through that door...

30:47.774 --> 30:49.071
Right.

30:49.196 --> 30:51.764
And you asked him for an autograph,
but he ignored you.

30:51.889 --> 30:53.073
- Right.
- Right.

30:53.202 --> 30:54.895
You said he was upset about something.

30:55.020 --> 30:55.883
Right!

30:56.427 --> 30:59.315
He kept repeating
something over and over.

30:59.457 --> 31:00.355
Right!

31:03.047 --> 31:04.803
What was he yelling?

31:05.937 --> 31:08.518
- Chet!
- Out of order!

31:09.362 --> 31:11.586
"It's out of order."
That's what he kept sayin'.

31:12.472 --> 31:16.454
- What was out of order?
- I don't know! Musta been... somethin'!

31:18.166 --> 31:21.065
Something.
That's a big help. Thank you.

31:31.795 --> 31:33.081
It's not the phone.

31:35.299 --> 31:37.279
Something is out of order.

31:38.656 --> 31:41.636
It's out of order.
Must be inside.

31:48.277 --> 31:50.750
It's an all-access pass.
Come on.

31:52.167 --> 31:53.034
Dude!

31:55.082 --> 31:56.775
You're like my best friend.

31:57.663 --> 32:00.896
You wanna hear something sad?
You're my best friend too.

32:09.806 --> 32:13.436
So the Wildcats take yet another time
out, and with the score still tied,

32:13.786 --> 32:15.408
we'll be back right after this.

32:16.663 --> 32:18.785
- So he was murdered?
- Yeah.

32:19.161 --> 32:20.464
I still can't believe it!

32:20.589 --> 32:22.378
You know, these things happen every day.

32:22.503 --> 32:24.890
Yeah, but it's heartbreaking.
Where's Adrian?

32:25.287 --> 32:27.880
He's outside. He's workin'the case.
He can't give it up.

32:28.005 --> 32:30.978
That's just like him.
The monomaniacal Mr. Monk.

32:31.404 --> 32:34.087
- Did he ever tell you how we met?
- No, not really.

32:34.212 --> 32:36.666
He mentioned something about
a demented cat salesman.

32:36.791 --> 32:38.165
No, that's not it exactly.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.832
There's a distinction here,
and it's really. It's fascinating.

32:40.975 --> 32:43.616
The cat salesman was not demented.

32:44.066 --> 32:46.536
He sold demented cats.

32:47.457 --> 32:48.987
No, no, but really, understand.

32:49.207 --> 32:52.150
He had a siamese
who was manic-depressive.

32:52.395 --> 32:54.109
He had a paranoid persian.

32:54.529 --> 32:56.119
The guy tried to sell me

32:56.244 --> 32:59.835
a calico kitten
who was completely psychotic evil!

33:00.100 --> 33:02.508
I mean, it tried to kill me.
The kitten tried to kill me.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.702
Okay, nice game though?

33:04.829 --> 33:07.640
It's a great game.
He had a burmese.

33:08.165 --> 33:10.818
Multiple personalities.
One of which was a dog.

33:11.665 --> 33:12.951
That's how weird it was.

33:13.406 --> 33:14.838
I'm not really a cat person.

33:15.221 --> 33:17.568
Well, it's. These are the facts.
I'm just tellin'ya.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.706
- This one works?
- They all work.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.917
So what was out of order?

33:29.418 --> 33:31.482
I don't know.
It's like a mystery.

33:35.967 --> 33:37.140
This is chet!

33:39.045 --> 33:42.987
What are they offering? Don't kid
yourself. 55 million means 70 million.

33:43.112 --> 33:45.712
We don't counter till they
hit the number. I'll call ya later.

33:47.522 --> 33:48.543
Who are you?

33:49.242 --> 33:51.772
Hedge fund manager.
But not today.

33:55.157 --> 33:57.374
All right, here's the snap.
Wildcats blitzing.

33:57.685 --> 33:59.511
And it's picked off again!

34:00.357 --> 34:02.330
That's the third Condor turnover.

34:02.685 --> 34:05.317
The defensive coordinator of
the Wildcats, Brian Binsack,

34:05.442 --> 34:08.328
has been one step ahead of
the Condors all game long.

34:08.453 --> 34:10.473
It's almost as if he's
reading their minds.

34:11.462 --> 34:13.155
You know, with head coach
Kent Mcfarland

34:13.280 --> 34:15.654
scheduled to retire at the end
of the year for the Wildcats,

34:15.779 --> 34:19.271
I'd say the way things are going,
binsack is a shoe in to get the job.

34:19.996 --> 34:21.067
I got it!

34:22.356 --> 34:24.274
I know who killed Davy Gitelson.

34:28.668 --> 34:30.627
It wasn't a vending machine.

34:31.098 --> 34:33.813
I can't help but wonder
what we're talkin'about.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.639
Something was out of order, right?

34:36.996 --> 34:39.701
But it wasn't any machine.
It was the playbook.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.679
The team playbook!

34:42.731 --> 34:43.813
I remember now.

34:45.062 --> 34:48.348
I saw the book.
Some of the pages were mixed up.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.016
Here's what happened.

34:53.634 --> 34:55.223
His limo driver, sean Metzger,

34:55.348 --> 34:58.450
was in a perfect position to
steal the Condors'playbook.

34:59.373 --> 35:02.373
He probably only had a few minutes.
He made a quick copy,

35:02.563 --> 35:05.461
and at some point,
the pages must have gotten mixed up.

35:08.556 --> 35:11.903
He sold the xeroxed copy to
that coach from the Wildcats.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.440
He made a few bucks.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.030
He probably thought
that was the end of it.

35:17.232 --> 35:19.311
But this morning,
after he got dropped off,

35:19.436 --> 35:22.000
Gitelson realized something was wrong.

35:26.609 --> 35:28.698
It's out of order!
It's all out of order!

35:28.823 --> 35:31.348
What? Will you sign that?
No, look, i'm looking for somebody.

35:31.473 --> 35:34.602
He figured out what happened.
He went looking for the driver.

35:40.952 --> 35:43.094
- Did you sell me out?
- What are you talking about?

35:43.219 --> 35:45.148
You gonna call the police on me?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.962
The fight must have escalated.
Metzger panicked.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.628
But the gates had already opened.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.684
Fans were just starting to show up.

35:54.811 --> 35:58.063
Metger was racing the clock,
he was improvising.

35:58.188 --> 36:01.555
He had to hide the body in plain sight.

36:02.806 --> 36:04.774
That's why Metzger was
trying to kill you.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.935
He saw you two talking.
He thought you knew too much.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.556
Hedge fund manager.
Yeah, that makes sense.

36:12.844 --> 36:16.534
- What do we do now, call the cops?
- No. There's not enough time.

36:16.659 --> 36:18.955
If he destroys that playbook,
we don't have a case.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.902
It's probably in the locker room.

36:22.808 --> 36:23.474
What?

36:23.599 --> 36:27.303
Well, this morning, the Condors were
favored by 12, but the wildcat defense

36:27.428 --> 36:30.162
has played a nearly flawless
first two quarters of football,

36:30.287 --> 36:32.858
and as we send you back to the studio
for the halftime show,

36:32.986 --> 36:34.895
it's all tied up 10 to 10.

36:36.367 --> 36:37.918
10 to 10.

36:38.760 --> 36:39.801
Monk'd love that?

36:52.689 --> 36:54.464
All right, everybody settle down!

36:55.111 --> 36:56.956
Settle down!
Eyes up front.

36:58.772 --> 37:00.211
That was a good first half.

37:00.336 --> 37:03.654
But we have a long way to go.
The key is to maintain control.

37:03.973 --> 37:04.929
Stay focused.

37:05.101 --> 37:07.807
They're gonna try to change some
things up on us in the second half.

37:07.977 --> 37:11.058
Look for the triple option...
Out of the wishbone formation.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.694
Triple option? Coach,
I haven't seen that since college.

37:13.838 --> 37:16.185
Well, you're gonna see
it today you count on it.

37:16.406 --> 37:18.304
Probably on their first possession.

37:18.874 --> 37:21.564
All right, dante, take us home.
Okay, guys, let's take a knee.

37:26.248 --> 37:29.137
Lord, let your light continue
to shine on this team today.

37:29.949 --> 37:31.642
Give us the wisdom and the strength

37:31.767 --> 37:34.359
to accept whatever fortune
befalls this team today.

37:35.098 --> 37:37.404
Give us the power to
devour the other team.

37:37.997 --> 37:41.199
Give us the strength
and the discipline to remain calm

37:41.324 --> 37:43.140
in all hard times.

37:44.659 --> 37:46.883
Help us dominate the other side, lord.

37:47.141 --> 37:50.182
Give us the power to just totally
annihilate the other team.

37:51.529 --> 37:53.019
- Amen.
- Amen.

37:53.787 --> 37:57.292
- Hey, that's our playbook!
- No, no, this is not your playbook!

37:57.417 --> 38:00.883
This is stolen property. I'm a former
police officer. Here's the thing...

38:02.261 --> 38:05.261
- Wildcats suck!
- Security, get that playbook!

38:06.749 --> 38:08.926
Security!
Get that book!

38:17.027 --> 38:18.272
- Yeah.
- I gotta go.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.363
- Now? It's only halftime.
- Yeah, I know. You've been great.

38:21.488 --> 38:22.847
- Thank you.
- No problem.

38:22.972 --> 38:25.518
But my best friend,
great guy, an amazing guy,

38:25.643 --> 38:29.132
I left him downstairs alone,
and he deserves better.

38:29.823 --> 38:31.084
Sure. Understand.

38:31.938 --> 38:33.040
Is he with Monk?

38:37.095 --> 38:39.279
Security!
Get that book!

38:40.051 --> 38:41.640
Get him!
Get the book!

39:11.119 --> 39:12.201
Is the game over?

39:16.100 --> 39:17.090
Who won?

39:19.755 --> 39:20.633
We did.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.829
Back at Summit stadium,
where the Condors have come from behind

39:27.954 --> 39:30.420
and defeated the Wildcats 27-24

39:30.553 --> 39:32.461
in one of the greatest
playoff games ever.

39:32.586 --> 39:35.112
Meanwhile, there was plenty
of drama away from the field,

39:35.237 --> 39:37.795
and here to tell us about it
is captain Leland Stottlemeyer

39:37.940 --> 39:40.675
of the San Francisco police
along with former detective.

39:42.185 --> 39:44.627
Captain, we just saw the defensive coach

39:44.752 --> 39:47.192
of the Wildcats led away from
the stadium in handcuffs.

39:47.346 --> 39:51.040
- What can you tell us?
- Well, Mr. Binsack has been arrested

39:51.429 --> 39:54.306
and charged with receipt
of stolen property.

39:55.654 --> 39:59.235
And, I can also tell you that
Davy Gitelson's personal driver

39:59.367 --> 40:01.724
has also been arrested in marin county.

40:03.741 --> 40:05.936
Bob. Well, I'd say from
the standpoint of law enforcement,

40:06.061 --> 40:08.397
you and Mr. Monk are the MVPS today.

40:08.905 --> 40:10.886
You know, for those who don't know,

40:11.011 --> 40:13.246
Adrian Monk is a legend
in San Francisco,

40:13.371 --> 40:15.575
and on a personal note,
a few years back,

40:15.841 --> 40:18.310
this man literally saved my life.

40:18.576 --> 40:21.127
No, I wouldn't say that. The truth.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.965
How can you say that? You
were there! The cat tried to kill me!

40:24.090 --> 40:26.873
You weren't really in any danger.
It was a little calico cat.

40:27.036 --> 40:28.254
It was about this big.

40:28.379 --> 40:31.594
Wait a minute you proved it.
You solved the case.

40:31.719 --> 40:35.444
The cat planned the whole thing out. She
was gonna kill me with that squeeze toy.

40:36.889 --> 40:39.791
Yeah... the truth is I just
wanted to get out of the house.

40:39.916 --> 40:42.501
Yeah. Look, I think we're done here.
Bob, Cut to a commercial.

40:43.049 --> 40:45.782
I guess that does it.
From summit stadium, again the final.

40:46.027 --> 40:49.006
The Condors 27, the Wildcats 24.

40:49.350 --> 40:52.388
I'm Bob Costas saying so long.
And one last time...

40:53.416 --> 40:57.171
The Cab was definitely trying
to kill me.

40:58.113 --> 41:00.480
Dwight is right,
it is better than being there.
