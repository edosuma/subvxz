00:00.933 --> 00:02.001
<i>[Tammy] Previously on
the 1000-lb Sisters...</i>

00:02.003 --> 00:04.937
[Amy] The nurse could've
kept Tammy on the right track

00:04.939 --> 00:06.739
<i>and given me time
with my family.</i>

00:06.741 --> 00:08.707
I need this to work

00:08.709 --> 00:10.909
How do you feel about
Amy farting all the time?

00:10.911 --> 00:13.112
<i>[Amy] And Tammy burping
all the time.</i>

00:13.813 --> 00:15.414
<i>And maybe a little bit
of diarrhea.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:17.950
- Ew.
- [laughing]

00:17.952 --> 00:20.252
What do y'all fart out?
Which one farting all the time?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.754
Her.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.989
<i>[Michael] I'm kinda worried
because I have a weigh-in</i>

00:23.991 --> 00:25.391
<i>at the doctor's
that's coming up.</i>

00:25.393 --> 00:27.593
So I either make back
the target weight

00:27.595 --> 00:29.928
<i>or there's a damn good
possibility</i>

00:29.930 --> 00:32.131
that he's not going to
let me have my surgery.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.299
Uh, it's time to find a chair.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.370
Aww.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.274
Well, I don't want your heart
hurt again.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.410
You say you got this,
but then...

00:45.512 --> 00:49.415
I am a little worried. Tammy
does not have the best track record

00:49.417 --> 00:53.385
when it comes to finding guys that would
actually help her with her weight loss journey.

00:58.058 --> 01:02.127
[music playing]

01:03.229 --> 01:04.296
<i>[Amy] Quack quack.</i>

01:05.698 --> 01:09.034
Oh, ew.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.805
<i>[Amy] Today is the nurse's
first day on the job.</i>

01:12.807 --> 01:14.606
<i>Thank God,
we finally picked a person.</i>

01:14.608 --> 01:16.842
Tammy wants a friend.

01:16.844 --> 01:21.080
And I need somebody to
help her get more independent.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.215
So, that was the whole...

01:25.385 --> 01:27.286
and she was just fun
to kick it with.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.327
- [knocking at door]
- Come in.

01:39.699 --> 01:40.799
Hello.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.067
<i>- [child] Hi.
- Hello, son.</i>

01:42.368 --> 01:43.702
[Tisa] How y'all doing?

01:43.769 --> 01:47.306
- [Amy] How are you? Good.
- I'm good, how are you doing today, Amy?

01:48.641 --> 01:51.577
<i>[Tisa] I'm a home helper
for 30 years.</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:53.745
I'm from Henderson, Kentucky

01:53.747 --> 01:55.881
<i>I'm a pretty easy going person.</i>

01:55.883 --> 01:57.416
<i>I like to help people.</i>

01:57.418 --> 01:59.184
I'm just who I am.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.854
What you see is what you get.

02:01.856 --> 02:05.858
<i>Amy and Tammy, you can tell they're sisters,
they look like they're pretty close.</i>

02:05.860 --> 02:07.993
<i>They're kinda entertaining.</i>

02:08.094 --> 02:10.395
So, what we gonna do today?

02:13.666 --> 02:16.301
Okay, hey, you like to cook?

02:20.740 --> 02:23.041
Just to the mailbox and back
or something.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.444
God damn it, Amy, no.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.413
[baby cooing]

02:29.048 --> 02:30.315
You don't want to?

02:31.551 --> 02:32.684
Tammy.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.388
Keeping Tammy mobile
and up, doing stuff is important

02:36.390 --> 02:40.626
because if she losses her
mobility, she will be bed-bound.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.427
After that is death.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.303
[Tisa] Okay,
you go ahead and pee.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.108
<i>[Amy] I need Tisa
to keep Tammy on track</i>

02:56.110 --> 02:57.676
<i>and get Tammy exercising</i>

02:57.678 --> 03:01.313
and she's there to help
clean, help cook.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.983
<i>Help is the key word there,
not do it for her.</i>

03:04.985 --> 03:09.054
So, I want to pull Tisa away to the
side, to let her know the run down.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.127
Oh, really?

03:17.230 --> 03:18.397
Does she act like that?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.100
Really?

03:29.943 --> 03:34.012
[Tisa] Aww, well, we'll be...
I'm gonna do my best with her.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.982
She's just got to do
some trusting.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.964
[Tammy] Yeah.

03:59.672 --> 04:03.909
<i>[Tisa] My first impression of Tammy,
you gotta kinda have to push her.</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:07.312
I think she just got to have
somebody there with her to help her

04:07.314 --> 04:10.482
and keep her going
'cause we all have our days.

04:10.484 --> 04:14.720
It might be some day, she might
say "Bitch, get out of here." [laughing]

04:14.722 --> 04:18.090
That's cool. 'Cause I
ain't going nowhere today.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.425
[Tisa] So, what
we're going to have to eat?

04:21.894 --> 04:23.528
Do you use a cook book?

04:23.530 --> 04:27.099
Are you one of those person's with a little
bit of this and a little bit of that?

04:28.568 --> 04:31.236
- So, you're not giving out any recipes, are you?
- [Tammy laughing]

04:34.307 --> 04:38.510
I wouldn't say I'm excited to
have a stranger in my house,

04:38.512 --> 04:40.379
going through my things.

04:40.381 --> 04:44.316
But it might be nice to have
someone to talk to and kick it with.

04:46.719 --> 04:50.856
-[Tisa] You want a salad? No salad.
-[Tammy] No. Hell no.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.325
<i>[Tisa] But you could steam
that broccoli and cauliflower.</i>

05:05.772 --> 05:10.409
[Tisa speaking]

05:10.411 --> 05:12.411
[Tammy] I'm not making
[bleep] hamburger patties.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.693
Tammy and Tisa are having a
discussion about the meal prep.

05:27.695 --> 05:31.763
<i>But Tammy of course
has to give her an attitude.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:33.332
<i>The whole idea
of getting a home health nurse</i>

05:33.334 --> 05:36.635
was to make life easier
for Tammy and me.

05:36.637 --> 05:40.339
But if Tammy and Tisa can't get
along, there ain't no way for this to work.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.609
[Tisa] Hey, let's get,
let's get chopping.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.947
I'mma put the meat in here
and you get that fire going.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.950
Well, you gonna help me,
aren't you?

05:52.785 --> 05:54.419
Uh, you gonna starve me
to death.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.124
[Tisa speaking]

06:16.042 --> 06:17.342
[Tisa] Where'd you learn
how to cook?

06:18.511 --> 06:20.912
Uh, girl.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.715
<i>[Tammy] Tisa and I
seem like a pretty good team.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:27.386
Having Tisa around is a lot
better than having Amy around.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.029
She got this little
stove going, I love it.

06:39.665 --> 06:43.034
[Amy speaking]

06:55.214 --> 07:00.318
Okay, everybody, this is good,
nice and healthy, high in protein.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.155
[Amy speaking]

07:09.862 --> 07:10.362
This is good.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.266
[Tisa] Mm. Mm!

07:15.401 --> 07:19.337
[music playing]

07:22.842 --> 07:23.542
[Amy speaking]

07:23.544 --> 07:25.243
[Tammy speaking]

07:36.722 --> 07:39.925
and we can go back to just
having fun and being sisters.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.127
Go get in the van, come on.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.440
Move, a little. Ooh!

07:59.212 --> 08:01.346
[music playing]

08:05.618 --> 08:08.286
[dog barking]

08:15.595 --> 08:18.663
<i>[Tammy] Today, I'm
channeling myself off the oxygen,</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:22.167
Somedays I need my oxygen
little more than the others, but...

08:28.674 --> 08:31.209
- [dog barking]
- You remember her?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.012
She hears the other dogs.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.081
Okay, so what do you want
to do with her today?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.350
- The works.
- All right, hey, baby.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.992
<i>We've had her for 13 years.</i>

08:46.994 --> 08:50.028
Michael found her,
he got her off somebody.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.204
[Amy speaking]

09:03.843 --> 09:05.243
And they're both my bitch.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.880
All right, sweetheart.

09:18.291 --> 09:22.827
Sometimes, these dogs, they'll get
like a fishy smell or something like that

09:22.829 --> 09:26.932
or they're scooting their butt or
they'll be biting above their tail.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.833
That's their anal glands
filling up

09:28.835 --> 09:31.036
and they need to express
every now and then.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.313
That's a serious question.
[laughing]

09:41.914 --> 09:44.115
[dog barking]

09:44.884 --> 09:46.084
[Amy] What've you been up to?

09:54.393 --> 09:55.694
[Amy speaking]

09:55.696 --> 09:57.395
Of course.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.965
We've always had rocky times
with our mom

09:59.967 --> 10:04.169
and she hasn't always believed
in Tammy and me losing weight.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.839
We're doing
the bariatric surgery.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.208
I don't think you'll make it.
I think you'll chicken out.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.982
[Amy speaking]

10:32.698 --> 10:35.634
I'm kinda touched Tammy
brought up Mother's Day

10:35.636 --> 10:40.805
because we never really did much as
a family growing up for Mother's Day.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.975
But this is my first
Mother's Day as a mom.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.179
Man, we do that
all the time though.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.981
- [Amy] Yeah.
- We could do that anytime.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.029
Yeah.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.065
[laughing]

11:07.633 --> 11:08.767
[Tammy] She likes
drinking tea a lot

11:08.769 --> 11:11.870
and we never been
to like a high tea brew.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.139
What high tea, you have
to, you have to drink it high?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.273
[laughing]

11:22.882 --> 11:25.150
[Amy speaking]

11:34.827 --> 11:36.361
[laughing]

11:50.142 --> 11:51.242
[bleep]

11:52.211 --> 11:54.245
No, it doesn't.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.417
No.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.953
[Amy speaking]

12:02.555 --> 12:03.654
[Amy speaking]

12:05.891 --> 12:08.326
[woman] She did great.
Thanks for bringing her in.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.129
- [Amy] Okay, thank you.
- Thank you guys.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.752
- Thank you guys.
- [Amy] Thank you.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.385
[woman] Thank you.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.990
[music playing]

12:47.833 --> 12:51.336
<i>[Tammy] Ew, I just like...
little update,</i>

12:52.037 --> 12:53.304
<i>been living life.</i>

13:52.898 --> 13:54.098
No.

13:54.100 --> 13:58.736
<i>Phillip and I are together.</i>

13:58.738 --> 14:01.406
That's my man. I'm his woman.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.927
<i>He told me he likes big girls.</i>

14:22.929 --> 14:24.295
He's just a supporter.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.298
[Tammy speaking]

14:33.706 --> 14:38.076
<i>He's all for me losing weight
and getting healthier.</i>

14:46.952 --> 14:48.052
Thank you guys for watching.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.187
Bye.

14:51.023 --> 14:51.923
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.057
Welcome to the Miller House.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.059
Today is my very first
Mother's Day.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.327
So we're going to have tea.

14:56.996 --> 14:57.962
[Amy speaking]

15:01.767 --> 15:03.701
<i>One of my great grandma,</i>

15:03.703 --> 15:05.203
<i>was the Queen of England.</i>

15:07.039 --> 15:07.972
[Amy and Tammy burping]

15:07.974 --> 15:09.340
[both] Excuse me.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.911
Tammy's secretly
dating this dude.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.012
He's got a fetish.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.914
Because Tammy's big.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.016
Answer me this.
Are you engaged?

15:21.053 --> 15:22.353
[lively music playing]

15:26.859 --> 15:28.393
[Amy speaking]

15:31.764 --> 15:33.731
<i>It took me 33 years
to be a mother.</i>

15:33.733 --> 15:35.400
<i>32. Whatever.</i>

15:37.002 --> 15:39.270
<i>[Amy] Today is my very first
Mother's Day.</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:41.205
So we're going to high tea.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.107
High tea is,

15:43.709 --> 15:45.209
something snooty bitches do.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.178
With their pinkies out.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.390
No.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.327
After Amy had the baby,

16:03.062 --> 16:04.395
she become a different person.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.378
[Tammy speaking]

16:24.717 --> 16:26.250
[Amy speaking]

16:28.487 --> 16:29.787
Oh, there's a lift.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.823
Yeah, I forgot there was
an elevator type dealio.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.957
Yeah, right there it is.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.069
[Michael speaking]

17:01.387 --> 17:02.387
[door slams]

17:11.030 --> 17:11.763
[Amy] Hi, Mom.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.431
- Hello.
- How you doing?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.933
- Hi.
- [Amy and Tammy] Hello.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.835
Good to see you all.
Welcome to the Miller House.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.771
I am Valarie Roberts.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.239
I am Kentucky's Etiquette Lady.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.043
[all laughing]

17:25.778 --> 17:26.978
This Mary Poppins looking bitch.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.179
[chuckling]

17:28.814 --> 17:30.248
<i>Oh, she's in for it.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:33.084
We're gonna break this lady.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.922
So, today we're gonna
have an afternoon tea.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.091
Have y'all ever had
an afternoon tea?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.125
Or formal tea?

17:41.127 --> 17:42.293
Or a high tea?

17:42.761 --> 17:43.928
[Tammy speaking]

17:43.930 --> 17:45.430
Okay. Well, how special.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.931
We're gonna get into this today.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.100
So, there's usually
three courses

17:49.102 --> 17:50.902
that make up an afternoon tea.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.103
The first course

17:52.105 --> 17:55.773
is always going
to be your tea sandwiches.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.143
The second course
is muffins or scones.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.679
And then your last course
is the dessert.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.381
[Tammy speaking]

18:08.320 --> 18:10.721
<i>[Amy] There is a lot
of sugar on this table.</i>

18:10.723 --> 18:12.890
These little crustless
sandwiches

18:12.892 --> 18:14.692
<i>that look like
a two-year-old made.</i>

18:14.726 --> 18:16.027
<i>Muffins.</i>

18:16.029 --> 18:18.696
<i>And this piece of cake
called penny fours.</i>

18:18.698 --> 18:19.864
<i>And on top of that,</i>

18:19.866 --> 18:21.666
<i>there's cubes of sugar.</i>

18:21.668 --> 18:24.001
Are British people
non-diabetics?

18:24.003 --> 18:26.003
<i>[Amy] Let's see what
this taste like.</i>

18:29.074 --> 18:31.242
[Valarie] Pour the hot water in.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.277
I mean, I don't do it.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.146
[Valarie]

18:35.948 --> 18:37.081
No?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.116
You drink tea.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.053
[Amy and Tammy] Oh.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.059
Not really.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.295
[Darlene speaking]

18:51.297 --> 18:53.097
I don't drink coffee.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.031
Tea.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.199
Cocoa.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.434
None of it.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.337
[Amy speaking]

19:01.874 --> 19:04.041
You will really like this.
It's delicious.

19:04.043 --> 19:04.775
[Amy speaking]

19:04.777 --> 19:05.977
[Tammy] Just try it.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.279
- [Tammy] We're gonna try it with you.
- Yes.

19:09.948 --> 19:10.982
[Amy] You want lemon or...

19:12.784 --> 19:14.352
I don't like lemon in tea.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.328
[Tammy burps]
Excuse me.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.168
- [Valarie] No.
- [Tammy] You sip it.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.069
[Tammy snickers]

19:36.108 --> 19:37.041
[All] No.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.179
[country music playing]

19:53.158 --> 19:54.425
- No.
- Jerry.

19:54.993 --> 19:55.993
Well.

19:56.161 --> 19:56.727
I did bring

19:56.729 --> 19:59.163
a couple of hats.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.632
I think this will look good with
your green that you have on.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.167
[Tammy] God.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.809
I love it. I think
you all look good.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.077
It's very Kentucky.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.148
[Tammy speaking]

20:17.150 --> 20:18.282
[Tammy laughing]

20:18.884 --> 20:20.051
[Darlene laughing]

20:20.752 --> 20:22.386
The hats were ridiculous.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.127
[burps]
Excuse me.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.802
My grandma's brother
has this family tree.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.204
Going back generations
and generations.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.739
And apparently,

20:41.741 --> 20:42.807
one of my greats

20:42.809 --> 20:45.042
I don't know how far...

[Tammy speaking]

20:58.090 --> 20:59.257
Oh.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.662
[Tammy] You're so ghetto.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.630
My god.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.365
- [Tammy] She took it all.
- Good God.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.035
Why did you...
You could have put it on...

21:11.037 --> 21:13.404
Amy, I taught you
better than that.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.406
I think Amy's in denial.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.907
She can't continue
eating this way

21:16.909 --> 21:18.609
if she wants to lose weight.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.846
I'm just taking a bite,
one bite of everything.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.415
Bitch you put that whole
of petit four in your mouth.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.250
[Tammy mimicking] Oh it's
too much icing.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.891
[Tammy snickers]

21:33.893 --> 21:34.825
[gibberish]

21:34.827 --> 21:36.027
Stop.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.330
[bleeping] bee.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.199
No.

21:42.201 --> 21:42.900
[Tammy laughing]

21:42.902 --> 21:44.235
Get out.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.241
Get, get off me you
sons of bitches.

21:51.677 --> 21:52.843
[Darlene] Tammy.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.013
Since you been outta
the uh, rehab place,

21:56.081 --> 21:58.849
is it easier or harder

21:58.851 --> 22:00.384
to stay on your weight loss?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.186
So far, so good.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.621
I just wanna eat fruit

22:03.623 --> 22:06.057
and lunch meat.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.758
- Just not the...
- Yeah, lunch meat's bad for you.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.826
Well, I mean...

22:08.828 --> 22:10.961
I just want something
quick and easy.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.998
And how's it going
doing the exercises?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.233
I don't have the equipment.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.804
But walking across the street

22:19.806 --> 22:20.938
or down the driveway.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.107
That's exercise.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.576
Any physical movement
is exercise.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.377
I know.

22:33.051 --> 22:35.019
Ready to get the hell
outta here.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.972
[breathing heavily]

22:56.041 --> 22:57.241
Oh [bleep].

23:00.645 --> 23:04.048
[melancholy music playing]

23:05.884 --> 23:09.019
<i>[Amy] Seeing Tammy struggle to
get from the restaurant to the van</i>

23:09.021 --> 23:10.888
<i>is very hard to watch.</i>

23:10.955 --> 23:12.723
I wanna talk to Tisa,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.492
about is Tammy really doing

23:14.494 --> 23:15.760
what she's supposed to do.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.864
<i>Because if you're having
that much trouble,</i>

23:19.866 --> 23:21.999
<i>you're not doing what
you're supposed to be doing.</i>

23:39.851 --> 23:42.353
[breathing heavily]

23:46.925 --> 23:48.225
Here you go.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.932
Have you seen Tammy's Instagram?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.901
- No.
- You might wanna check it out.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.102
He's got a fetish.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.004
Because Tammy's big

24:00.006 --> 24:00.938
<i>He wants her to stay</i>

24:00.940 --> 24:02.873
<i>morbidly obese.</i>

24:07.078 --> 24:10.114
[captivating instrumental

24:12.250 --> 24:13.350
Eight.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.020
Nine.

24:16.621 --> 24:17.921
Ten.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.025
Tammy and Tisa have been
working together for two weeks now.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.627
<i>And, sometimes
when I go over there,</i>

24:23.629 --> 24:26.864
<i>I am seeing Tisa working.</i>

24:26.866 --> 24:28.332
<i>And Tammy's sitting
in her chair.</i>

24:28.733 --> 24:29.834
But,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.936
I am hiring you to help her.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.171
Not do it for her.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.639
Now, this is...
you can do yourself.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.508
It's those

24:37.510 --> 24:41.045
uh, Kegel exercises, you know
just sit in your chair and do it.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.050

I know you...

25:00.031 --> 25:00.898
[Tammy]

25:00.900 --> 25:02.166
[Tisa] What is it?

25:04.402 --> 25:05.970
Tighten up your butt muscles.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.205
And you can sit there
and do that all day long.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.974
- [Tammy] I can't.
- [Tisa] Huh?

25:09.976 --> 25:10.875
[Tammy] I can't.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.042

25:22.621 --> 25:23.921
<i>I think that</i>

25:23.923 --> 25:26.023
Tammy is trying
to be a manipulator.

25:26.057 --> 25:26.790
So,

25:26.792 --> 25:28.859
me and Tisa need to talk.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.762
I'm trying to make sure Tisa's
pushing Tammy

25:31.764 --> 25:33.130
to lose this weight.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.167
[Tisa] Bye.
[Tammy] Bye.

25:46.811 --> 25:47.778
Hey Tisa.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.413
What's going on?

25:49.415 --> 25:51.815
Um, I just wanna see
how's Tammy doing.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.617
Well you know what
it's getting better.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.419
You know my first,
first couple of days,

25:55.421 --> 25:57.721
kinda getting used to me
and stuff.

25:57.723 --> 26:01.058
Each day I go, she seem like
she's getting a little more happy.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.027
You know, smiling more.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.161
And, you know.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.869
So do you have any
concerns about her?

26:11.871 --> 26:15.506
My main concern is just trying
to keep her mobility.

26:15.508 --> 26:17.675
You know where she
can stay mobile.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.110
Just little things that she
can do. I try to do to help her.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.746
What type of exercises
she can do?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.882
She can exercise her arms.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.017
She can exercise her fingers.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.153
But you gotta make her do it.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.121
What the [bleep]?

26:31.123 --> 26:33.958
What...
this is not working out.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.225
Maybe your finger

26:35.560 --> 26:36.894
I guess but,

26:36.896 --> 26:39.997
the fingers are not
the fat part.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.266
You gotta work out
the whole body, girl.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.535
How's the walking going?

26:44.537 --> 26:46.971
Well, you know that walk
is gonna be a struggle.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.906
And when I say something
about that walk

26:48.908 --> 26:50.140
and it's just like a,

26:50.375 --> 26:51.942
a defense.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.546
And like she said, I'm already
doing stuff with my hands, I cook.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.181
I say, yeah you're awesome
with your hands.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.622
Yeah, but
most of the times she is like,

27:04.624 --> 27:06.123
"No, I'm not walking today.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.892
[stutters] I've done this
and I already done that."

27:08.894 --> 27:13.364
And I say, "Oh, okay." But everyday
I'd go, I'mma see would she walk.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.933
<i>[Amy] Tammy did</i>

27:15.935 --> 27:19.937
like 30 to an hour worth of physical
therapy while she was up in rehab

27:19.939 --> 27:21.572
<i>everyday.</i>

27:21.574 --> 27:23.941
<i>But now she ain't doing [bleep].</i>

27:23.943 --> 27:26.977
<i>I'm really pissed at this point.</i>

27:26.979 --> 27:28.979
Tammy had a fire in her ass

27:28.981 --> 27:30.881
to lose this weight.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.984
She came outta rehab
balls blazing.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.185
So...

27:37.922 --> 27:39.957
I'mma try my hardest.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.759
I'm praying.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.661
I'm praying. Cause I don't
want her to have a back.

27:43.663 --> 27:44.995
I wanna her to keep
going forward.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.430
- [Amy] Yeah me too.
- [Tisa] Yeah.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.247
[Chris] Hey babe, where you at?

28:03.948 --> 28:05.015
Right here.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.454
Ever since I stepped
on the scale at Tammy's house,

28:10.456 --> 28:12.156
<i>I've been walking</i>

28:12.158 --> 28:14.992
and really buckled down
on what I've been eating.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.027
<i>And now I just hope and pray
that I've done enough</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:18.962
to get back on track.

28:19.197 --> 28:22.299
Have you seen Tammy's Instagram?

28:22.901 --> 28:25.135
Lord help me, no.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.875
Yeah. You might wanna
check it out.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.243
- Is it that bad?
- Mm.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.446
[groans]

28:39.050 --> 28:41.985
What the hell has she got into?

28:50.028 --> 28:51.095
[Brittany] Wow.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.097
Read that.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.133
Currently dating The BBW King.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.402
He only associates

28:58.404 --> 29:00.070
with women who

29:00.072 --> 29:02.039
weigh 300 plus pounds.

29:03.041 --> 29:03.941
BBW

29:03.943 --> 29:06.176
stands for big beautiful women.

29:06.178 --> 29:09.413
But, you can't love
somebody for their size.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.682
He's got a fetish.

29:11.684 --> 29:13.183
Because Tammy's big.

29:16.821 --> 29:20.190
This says if I married you
at 450,

29:20.192 --> 29:22.726
and you get down to 299,

29:22.728 --> 29:23.427
just know,

29:24.395 --> 29:25.329
[Brittany] Am out.

29:27.832 --> 29:28.932
That's ridiculous.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.034
That's just shallow as [bleep].

29:32.670 --> 29:34.805
He just likes fat girls.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.808
That's the problem
we have at hand,

29:37.810 --> 29:39.476
is Tammy will not stay on track

29:39.478 --> 29:42.179
if she's up there doing this.

29:43.581 --> 29:48.085
The worst part about it is, is she is
going to have to be talked to about it.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.088
'Cause we did tell her we
weren't gonna take no bull[bleep].

29:51.322 --> 29:53.056
And this is bull[bleep].

29:55.660 --> 29:59.096
- We just don't want it turn into another Jerry thing.
- It's not. He's not Jerry.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.664
Step on that
[bleep] scale and show...

30:00.666 --> 30:02.166
I'm not doing it.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.919
Thanks for picking me up, bubby.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.254
Hey, no problem.
It's what we good for.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.689
Yeah.

30:25.691 --> 30:29.626
I recently found out that Tammy
is secretly dating this dude.

30:29.628 --> 30:32.629
<i>And his name is BBWKing online.</i>

30:32.631 --> 30:33.897
<i>So, me and Misty
are heading over to Tammy</i>

30:33.899 --> 30:37.034
and maybe talk
some sense into her.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.637
I haven't heard nothing
from her in over a week.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.407
Well, that's because she's
talking to that new dude.

30:52.917 --> 30:57.054
It might be some of it because we
were so down on Jerry about enabling her.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.656
When she come home
from that facility,

30:59.658 --> 31:02.593
Tammy had a fire to lose weight

31:02.595 --> 31:07.865
and do it on her own,
that I've never seen in Tammy.

31:07.867 --> 31:11.101
Yeah, and the next thing you know,
it's like somebody flipped the switch.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.904
<i>[Chris] I got to talk to Amy</i>

31:13.906 --> 31:17.007
and found out that Tammy's
been slacking on her diet.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.709
And it's really depressing

31:18.711 --> 31:21.612
'cause she knows what's at risk.

31:21.614 --> 31:24.715
And she just kinda
seems like she don't care.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.550
<i>Amy done tell me she didn't
want no part going in there</i>

31:26.552 --> 31:28.819
<i>and talking to Tammy
'bout her boyfriends.</i>

31:28.821 --> 31:32.789
<i>If Amy goes in there with this,
it'll be a knock-down, drag-out fight.</i>

31:32.791 --> 31:36.093
So, Amy just don't want
no part of it.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.429
Sometimes, I really
don't think Tammy cares.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.766
As long as she's happy,
and with somebody,

31:42.768 --> 31:47.504
she's willing to sacrifice everything
for five minutes of happiness.

31:47.506 --> 31:51.108
I think the boyfriend
is a hindrance.

31:51.110 --> 31:55.913
On the internet, I was reading that he
doesn't want her to get below 300 pounds

31:55.915 --> 31:58.515
and he's the BBWKing.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.184
So, yeah, it was...
It's a big concern.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.621
You start talking to a dude,
four days later

32:04.623 --> 32:06.790
it's true happiness,
like, they done fell in love.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.526
And yesterday,
or day before that,

32:09.528 --> 32:13.897
she started putting down,
like, that engagement rings on.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.500
- Post...
- Oh, I know. I've seen that Tammy was engaged.

32:16.502 --> 32:17.501
She is?

32:17.503 --> 32:20.737
That's what I've seen
on Facebook this morning.

32:20.739 --> 32:24.908
First of all, how the hell you gonna
go from meeting somebody one day

32:24.910 --> 32:27.844
and seven days later,
you got engaged to [bleep].

32:27.912 --> 32:29.546
I don't know.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.748
But we are going to have
to figure out a game plan

32:31.750 --> 32:34.718
because, we'd waited too long
to say anything about Jerry.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.353
Last time,
we let it go on for...

32:36.355 --> 32:39.289
Yeah, and she gained all
that weight and just, it's...

32:39.291 --> 32:42.759
You know, six or eight months,
we let him go on and all of a sudden,

32:42.761 --> 32:45.228
you know, she done
gain 90 pounds.

32:53.404 --> 32:57.040
We just, have to make sure we
don't have an attitude when we...

32:57.042 --> 32:58.976
and that's hard for us.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.011
- [Misty laughing]
- Ooh!

33:05.183 --> 33:07.084
[Chris speaking]

33:24.102 --> 33:25.335
[Chris exhales]

33:26.871 --> 33:28.071
- [Misty] Okay.
- [Chris speaking]

33:28.073 --> 33:29.239
[Misty speaking]

33:34.812 --> 33:35.979
[Chris] Knock, knock!

33:40.852 --> 33:42.386
How's it going?

33:43.721 --> 33:46.223
- [Chris] Good, I guess!
- [Misty] We were all just wondering how it was going.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.026
Are you doing your steps,
watching what you eat?

33:49.028 --> 33:50.060
Yes.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.195
[Misty] So, what kinda food
you've been eating?

33:53.131 --> 33:54.464
[Chris] Everyday?

33:56.234 --> 34:00.170
Chris and Misty are here being
nosy, asking all kinds of questions.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.544
Tammy...

34:10.348 --> 34:11.748
I've been hearing
some [bleep], girl.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.094
-I'm all about this. We're not doing...
-I'm very, very concerned.

34:26.431 --> 34:30.801
[Chris] My biggest concern is, Tammy,
when you come home from the facility,

34:30.803 --> 34:32.636
- you had a fire to lose weight.
- Yeah.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.903
I still do.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.175
Even though he said if you
get under 300, he's outta here?

34:38.177 --> 34:39.509
He never said that to me.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.345
He never said that to you
but he's put it on social media.

34:44.849 --> 34:48.752
But why is he doing [bleep]
like that and then being with you?

34:48.754 --> 34:51.488
He's trying to show
other big women

34:51.490 --> 34:54.591
that they're beautiful too,
like, supporting them.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.360
- Does he support you for your diet?
- [Tammy] Yes.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.973
- [Misty] Yeah.
- I guess I'll have to wait until we get there.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.563
[Chris] In order for you to be
around here 20 more years,

35:33.565 --> 35:36.867
you have to stay on track
with your diet.

35:36.869 --> 35:40.203
We gotta get ready for this doctor's
appointment that comes up shortly

35:40.205 --> 35:41.771
for Dr. Smith.

35:41.773 --> 35:45.242
And you know, when you step on
that damn scale, it ain't gonna lie for us.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.447
Do you think you'll be ready
for your doctor's appointment?

35:56.754 --> 35:59.022
You feel like
you lost any weight?

36:00.558 --> 36:04.127
It's been about ten days
since I've seen Tammy.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.063
<i>And, you know, I think
she's gained some weight.</i>

36:17.441 --> 36:19.009
I didn't say this.

36:21.078 --> 36:24.681
Where all we wanna do is
make sure you stay on track,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.483
so you can be self-sufficient,

36:26.485 --> 36:29.586
and go do whatever the hell
you want when you want.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.889
But you're gonna have to get
off your ass and put the effort.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.024
Because you done
started pissing me off.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.960
Because you're trying to
shut down right now. So I'm--

36:36.962 --> 36:39.262
No, [bleep] not. I'm saying
[bleep] talking to y'all.

36:40.831 --> 36:42.032
I am going to do it.

37:03.988 --> 37:05.522
<i>[Chris] Me and Misty are here
at Tammy's today</i>

37:05.524 --> 37:08.692
to talk to her about what we've
heard on, you know, social media.

37:08.694 --> 37:12.395
<i>The rumors about Tammy
and this dude getting engaged,</i>

37:12.397 --> 37:15.265
and I hope to God
it's really not true.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.639
[Misty] Well, I assumed,
I assumed you would.

37:22.641 --> 37:26.042
-[stammering] The... the... then...
-[Chris] But we wanna ask.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.411
[Tammy] I would come to you
[bleep] and tell you.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.512
No, [bleep] no.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.348
Well, that's what's on the
[bleep] damn internet.

37:33.884 --> 37:35.852
- [Misty] I didn't. Hey.
- Wouldn't you think, I would come and [bleep] tell you?

37:35.854 --> 37:37.320
Hold up now.

37:41.826 --> 37:46.630
<i>It would be nice for someone to
take my side every now and then.</i>

37:46.632 --> 37:49.032
I didn't wanna do this
[bleep] today.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.935
That's the problem. You don't
wanna do nothing any day.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.107
Step on that [bleep] scale
and show me.

38:01.212 --> 38:05.148
Because you know you haven't.
And that, is the bottom-line.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.825
We're not trying
to hurt your feelings or ours.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.294
[bleep] whatever, man.

38:22.166 --> 38:25.969
Why can't I [bleep]
just be happy, for once?

38:31.709 --> 38:33.276
[Tammy sobbing]

38:51.696 --> 38:53.863
We were just worried
because he has made it known

38:53.865 --> 38:56.166
that he doesn't
want you under 300.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.372
What if I don't wanna
get under 300?

39:04.408 --> 39:06.876
Now, is that you or him?

39:06.878 --> 39:08.044
Me!

39:08.046 --> 39:09.446
Because he's influencing you.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.613
No, he's not.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.318
<i>[Misty] Yeah, Tammy shocked me
real bad when she said</i>

39:15.320 --> 39:18.154
<i>maybe she didn't wanna
get under 300 pounds.</i>

39:20.358 --> 39:25.795
I'm hoping she doesn't give up and
go back to doing what she was doing.

39:25.797 --> 39:29.232
But, I guess, the scales is
gonna tell it all. I don't know.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.173
Okay, Phillip don't do that.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.142
But that's all
we were worried about,

39:39.144 --> 39:42.045
is, him influencing
your choices.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.913
Your track record says...

39:43.915 --> 39:48.118
Let the track record go. Your
track record ain't too clean, either.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.453
But, I'm not the one
in your position.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.589
Doesn't matter.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.258
It does matter if you wanna
live wh... a while longer.

40:01.432 --> 40:03.400
We do not wanna
have to bury you.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.505
But, you still need to do
what the hell the doctor...

40:08.507 --> 40:10.440
-wants you to do.
-[scoffs] What am I not doing?

40:10.442 --> 40:12.509
- The walking.
- Walking [bleep], whatever.

40:12.511 --> 40:16.546
I don't wanna walk outside
because, one, it's either raining,

40:16.548 --> 40:19.549
or, two, it's [bleep] hot. So, that's
why I want the [bleep] damn nurse

40:19.551 --> 40:23.153
to take me somewhere
but I haven't went anywhere.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.321
So, are you walking around
more in the house?

40:31.028 --> 40:32.162
No, we're not.

40:46.677 --> 40:47.577
All right.

41:34.892 --> 41:37.861
<i>[Chris] Next time on
1000lb Sisters...</i>

41:37.863 --> 41:39.629
You look like you have a mullet.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.698
[imitating]
I'm Billy Ray Cyrus, bitch.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.234
Wigs could do a lot
for your looks.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.402
[in an alien voice]
I am from the planet Mars.

41:49.039 --> 41:50.006
[smirks]

41:50.040 --> 41:51.407
[Amy speaking]

41:54.411 --> 41:56.579
[shrieking] It was!
It was!

41:56.581 --> 41:58.882
<i>Me and Michael called
a home organizer</i>

41:58.884 --> 42:02.986
<i>because I want a nice,
clean environment for Gage.</i>

42:02.988 --> 42:04.988
[sobbing]
Having people come here

42:05.356 --> 42:08.157
is so embarrassing.

42:09.627 --> 42:12.495
<i>[Chris] This is Tammy's first
appointment since she's left rehab.</i>

42:12.497 --> 42:14.864
[doctor] Let's step up here
on the scale.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.300
<i>[Chris] If Tammy's weight
starts going back up,</i>

42:17.302 --> 42:19.102
it's kinda like
game over for her.
