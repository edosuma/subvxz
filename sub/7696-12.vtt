01:45.855 --> 01:47.481
You do good work, Mr...

01:47.773 --> 01:49.233
What did you say your name was?

01:49.358 --> 01:51.110
Nitro, Mr. Daggett,

01:51.193 --> 01:53.154
on account of explosives
are my business.

01:54.071 --> 01:58.659
I assume Crocker explained
the terms of your employment, Mr. Nitro?

01:58.826 --> 02:02.038
Sure. There's an old gas line
running under the whole block.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.290
I make it look like
the pipeline ruptured,

02:04.373 --> 02:06.626
so the job can't be traced to you.

02:06.959 --> 02:10.713
It's to be done while I give my speech
to the Gotham Better Business Council.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.716
9:00 exactly.

02:14.175 --> 02:17.511
Trust me, when the hands
on that watch hit nine,

02:18.137 --> 02:19.221
boom.

02:22.141 --> 02:25.519
<i>As expected, the city zoning board
today rejected a request</i>

02:25.645 --> 02:29.982
<i>by the Daggett Development Corporation
to raze a block of landmark brownstones</i>

02:30.107 --> 02:31.817
<i>along Gotham's Park Row.</i>

02:31.942 --> 02:32.985
<i>Thirty years ago,</i>

02:33.069 --> 02:36.072
<i>Park Row was Gotham City's
most glamorous address.</i>

02:36.155 --> 02:39.200
<i>But, in recent years,
the area has suffered a decline.</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:43.537
<i>And today, it is a slum better known
as the infamous "Crime Alley."</i>

02:43.704 --> 02:44.705
<i>But, to its inhabitants,</i>

02:44.830 --> 02:47.375
<i>many of whom
spoke at the zoning board today,</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:49.835
<i>Crime Alley is the only home they have,</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:51.587
<i>and they fear its loss.</i>

02:51.837 --> 02:55.966
<i>Others, like Roland Daggett, director
of the Daggett Development Corporation,</i>

02:56.050 --> 02:58.386
<i>see the situation differently.</i>

03:01.097 --> 03:02.348
<i>It's tragic.</i>

03:02.765 --> 03:05.267
<i>Park Row may be an historical landmark,</i>

03:05.393 --> 03:08.062
<i>but it's also a breeding ground
for crime.</i>

03:08.187 --> 03:11.440
<i>Of course, as much as we disagree
with the zoning board's decision,</i>

03:11.691 --> 03:13.275
<i>our hands are tied.</i>

03:18.322 --> 03:20.241
Roland Daggett
is up to something, Alfred.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.494
That almost goes without saying,
doesn't it, sir?

03:23.869 --> 03:26.622
I don't know what it is yet, but I will.

03:26.747 --> 03:29.583
You don't want to be late
for your 8:00 appointment, sir.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.585
Have I ever been late?

03:32.503 --> 03:33.504
No, sir.

03:33.629 --> 03:35.089
Not once in all these years.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.228
Help! Help!

04:38.527 --> 04:40.988
Help! Somebody help my mommy!

04:41.781 --> 04:44.241
Those men in our apartment,

04:44.325 --> 04:45.326
they'll hurt her.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.328
I climbed out the window.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.662
Where?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.589
Lady, you and your kid
were told to clear out.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.051
You didn't listen.

05:02.426 --> 05:04.303
Maybe you'd like to be carried out.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.516
No! Please!

05:43.092 --> 05:44.093
Yah!

05:45.928 --> 05:47.638
Mommy! Mommy!

05:52.101 --> 05:53.102
Thank you.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.604
What did they mean,
you were warned to clear out?

05:55.938 --> 05:58.190
Couple of days ago, these three show up,

05:58.315 --> 06:00.234
say they're working
for some corporation.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.653
They tell everyone on our block
they got to leave.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.446
But, where are we gonna go?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.790
He's never been late before.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.792
I'd better look for him.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.753
Where you off to, Miss Thompkins?

06:20.129 --> 06:22.131
Just looking for a friend, Maggie.

06:22.464 --> 06:23.716
You be careful.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.344
Maggie, I've lived in Park Row
for 30 years.

06:27.469 --> 06:28.554
It's my home.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.472
I'm not afraid here.

07:02.963 --> 07:04.298
What are you doing here?

07:04.882 --> 07:06.550
This building is condemned.

07:09.845 --> 07:11.305
I saw you on the news.

07:11.513 --> 07:12.932
You work for Daggett.

07:17.227 --> 07:18.854
Oh, my gracious!

07:51.303 --> 07:53.013
I'm looking for Dr. Thompkins.

07:53.138 --> 07:56.100
She said
somebody was supposed to meet her.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.601
You?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.603
Where is she?

07:59.937 --> 08:01.522
Leslie went looking for you.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.023
I told her to be careful.

08:03.148 --> 08:06.110
Bad things happen to people
in Crime Alley.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.653
I know.

08:36.598 --> 08:37.891
Urban redevelopment, lady.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.435
That's what this is all about.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.645
Uh, tell me if the rope's too tight.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.571
All set. We just gotta do
that old hotel down the street.

08:50.654 --> 08:53.032
And then when 9:00 rolls around...

08:53.115 --> 08:55.701
Boom! Instant slum clearance.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.661
Next stop, mini-mall.

08:57.786 --> 09:00.039
You can't destroy that hotel.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.331
This block may be abandoned,

09:01.415 --> 09:03.500
but that building
has people living in it.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.170
Hey, we told them to leave.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.131
They stand in the way of redevelopment,
they get bulldozed.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.258
Nothing personal. Just business.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.219
You're insane.
You won't get away with-

09:30.486 --> 09:32.696
Alfred, did Leslie call?

09:32.821 --> 09:33.947
No, sir.

09:34.364 --> 09:37.034
<i>- Is</i> anything wrong?
<i>- We missed each other.</i>

09:37.701 --> 09:39.870
I'm on my way to her apartment.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.540
Something's come up, Alfred.
I'll be in touch.

10:01.558 --> 10:03.727
Now, you're gonna listen to me!

10:04.853 --> 10:08.148
I want justice, Gotham City!

10:11.276 --> 10:12.444
Who's the hostage?

10:12.986 --> 10:14.488
Some clerk from Daggett Development.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.032
Wrong place at the wrong time
with an eviction notice.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.076
Ten seconds, we make our move.

10:20.744 --> 10:22.746
If you go,
the hostage might be hurt.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.665
- I'II do it.
- You'll do it?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.834
Who do you think you are?

10:27.584 --> 10:28.585
Oh.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.213
You took my job, Gotham City!

10:31.463 --> 10:32.798
You took my home!

10:33.298 --> 10:35.300
Somebody's gotta pay for that!

10:35.759 --> 10:37.219
I pick you.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.265
Put the gun down!

10:41.348 --> 10:42.391
Who said that?

10:44.226 --> 10:45.227
Batman!

10:48.397 --> 10:49.398
Whoa.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.030
So, you're working for Daggett, too?

11:01.702 --> 11:04.037
I won't ask twice.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.025
Thanks for the help.
Good thing you showed up.

11:50.918 --> 11:51.919
Leslie?

12:44.763 --> 12:47.557
Poor Doc Thompkins. She's in trouble.

12:49.851 --> 12:50.852
What trouble?

12:50.936 --> 12:51.937
Uh, nothing.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.606
I didn't see them grab her.
I didn't see nothing.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.733
What do you mean? Who grabbed her?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.694
I don't know! Let go of me! Let go!

13:03.573 --> 13:05.158
Where did you get this blasting cap?

13:05.659 --> 13:07.995
And where's Dr. Thompkins?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.497
Two guys, they grabbed her.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.581
She dropped it.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.375
I thought I could sell it.
Get a few bucks.

13:13.750 --> 13:14.876
Where are they?

13:15.043 --> 13:16.753
Corner of Finger and Broom.

13:16.878 --> 13:18.505
That's all I know, honest!

13:39.401 --> 13:42.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce our speaker,

13:42.696 --> 13:44.781
a bold force for progress,

13:44.906 --> 13:47.826
a man of vision
with the will to execute his dreams,

13:48.285 --> 13:49.870
Roland Daggett.

14:14.269 --> 14:15.645
- He's hurt!
- He's passed out!

14:16.271 --> 14:17.647
- Help!
- Help!

14:23.862 --> 14:25.947
Perfect. Just perfect.

15:19.876 --> 15:21.503
- Look out!
- Runaway trolley!

15:21.628 --> 15:23.296
Get out of the way!
The trolley's coming!

15:43.733 --> 15:45.110
Don't leave us!

16:31.698 --> 16:32.866
Oh, my goodness. Thank God.

16:32.949 --> 16:34.242
Thank goodness. I was so afraid.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.411
Let us out of here!

16:38.038 --> 16:40.165
I've never been so scared
in all my life.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.074
Hello, Crocker.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.785
- Long time no see.
- Batman?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.578
What are you doing here?

17:20.455 --> 17:21.706
Meeting a friend.

17:21.998 --> 17:23.667
What are you doing here, Crocker?

17:23.875 --> 17:25.752
No. None of your business.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.212
Somebody is trying
to run the people

17:27.295 --> 17:28.755
in this neighborhood out of their homes.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.800
Your boss, Daggett,
wouldn't know anything about this,

17:31.883 --> 17:32.884
would he?

17:33.176 --> 17:35.220
No. No, of course not.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.640
How about you, Nitro?

17:40.350 --> 17:43.395
You told your parole board
you gave up the arson-for-hire game.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.731
I did. I'm clean.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.233
Really?

17:50.777 --> 17:51.987
Then what's this?

17:54.155 --> 17:57.075
You crazy? This stuff is dangerous.

17:57.325 --> 17:58.451
Talk to me, Nitro.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.204
After Daggett lost his appeal
to the zoning board,

18:01.371 --> 18:04.833
Crocker hired you to level
this whole neighborhood, didn't he?

18:05.083 --> 18:06.793
That's it. That's right. You got it.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.503
Don't tell Daggett I talked.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.964
Where's Leslie Thompkins?

18:11.214 --> 18:12.841
The old lady? In there.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.802
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:00.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.578
Don't worry about me.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.039
They're blowing up the old SRO Hotel.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.374
You've got to get the people out.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.127
Gentlemen,

18:49.628 --> 18:51.921
Gotham City is at a crossroads.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.050
As businessmen,
the choice we face is clear.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.886
It's time we decide where we stand.

18:58.511 --> 19:01.181
Are we for progress or against it?

19:01.848 --> 19:04.517
For the future or for the past?

19:05.226 --> 19:07.020
For the weak or for the strong?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.246
In short,

19:25.747 --> 19:29.376
we cannot allow
the underclass to hinder us

19:29.501 --> 19:31.461
from building a better tomorrow.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.746
Mr. Daggett. Mr. Daggett.
Any comments on this tragedy?

20:06.913 --> 20:09.499
Does this affect your plans
for redevelopment, Mr. Daggett?

20:11.584 --> 20:13.128
It's a sad fact,

20:13.586 --> 20:17.215
but you have to expect
violence in Crime Alley.

20:17.757 --> 20:20.468
These people don't value
human lifelike we do.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.556
Nobody values human life
like you do, Daggett.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.727
I diffused the bomb at the hotel.

20:29.352 --> 20:32.939
All your punks managed to destroy
were a few condemned buildings.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.024
Once they confess,

20:35.525 --> 20:36.985
you're finished.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.570
I'm shocked.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.158
Shocked to learn that arson
was the cause of this tragedy.

20:43.908 --> 20:46.995
Thank heaven the criminals responsible
have been caught.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.956
- But, Mr. Daggett, you told us to-
- DAGGETT: Officers,

20:50.081 --> 20:52.333
I believe your duty is clear.

20:57.338 --> 20:58.840
Excuse me.

21:08.808 --> 21:09.934
Let it go.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.021
Daggett won't escape the law forever.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.064
There's nothing you can do now.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.984
And besides,
you have an appointment to keep.

21:23.823 --> 21:26.117
This used to be a beautiful street.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.495
Good people lived here once.

21:29.287 --> 21:31.790
Good people still live in Crime Alley.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.342
