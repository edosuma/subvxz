00:16.320 --> 00:18.235
Sam, we're getting
straight gammas...

00:18.235 --> 00:20.324
...every half pulse at irregular
intervals.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.503
Let's move to right ascension 23
hours, 5 minutes.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.244
What the hell is going on out
here?

00:27.244 --> 00:29.246
Alpha Orionis is going
supernova.

00:29.246 --> 00:32.032
Sometime in the next 100 million
years.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.946
-Thursday.
-Excuse me?

00:33.946 --> 00:36.775
Thursday. It's going supernova
Thursday.

00:36.775 --> 00:39.778
If Alpha Orionis
were about to go supernova...

00:39.778 --> 00:42.216
...there would be silicon
flashes...

00:42.216 --> 00:43.782
...neutrino emissions....

00:43.782 --> 00:47.221
Even in daylight,
we would be able to see....

00:47.221 --> 00:48.396
You predicted this?

00:52.617 --> 00:54.141
Excuse me, Sam, I know you're
busy...

00:54.141 --> 00:55.533
...but it's almost noon.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.100
It's almost noon.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.797
It's noon, everybody. Let's go!

00:58.797 --> 01:00.103
Get in position! Let's go!

01:00.103 --> 01:01.539
What?

01:07.284 --> 01:08.764
What are you doing?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.639
You're pointing the damn thing
down!

01:16.163 --> 01:17.773
Professor,
there's this other phenomenon...

01:17.773 --> 01:21.037
...that Sam gives his priority
to at noon.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.386
Other priority? Now?

01:22.386 --> 01:24.475
Every day.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.825
What could be more important?

01:26.825 --> 01:30.264
Actually, this event isn't
strictly celestial.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.449
"I love you

02:25.449 --> 02:26.537
"He loved me

02:26.537 --> 02:28.365
"Said the little blue man

02:28.365 --> 02:31.107
"And scared me right out of my
wits"

02:39.550 --> 02:40.856
What is it?

02:43.989 --> 02:46.470
Remember I told you they were
going to pick a teacher...

02:46.470 --> 02:49.038
...to represent the district
at the school in New York?

02:49.038 --> 02:51.083
New York? You?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.737
That's great.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.219
Don't look at me like that.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.481
It's only two months.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.483
It's not like I'm going to the
moon.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.485
Two months is a long time.

03:01.485 --> 03:02.834
You could come.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.401
You know I can't.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.447
You could take off work.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.449
You just never
want to get out of this town...

03:08.449 --> 03:09.885
...and see the possibilities.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.409
Everything I want to see is
right here.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.411
You, the sky.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.721
I went to school
in that building right there.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.114
I hung upside down on this
jungle gym.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.943
In 20 years, I haven't moved an
inch.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.381
I fell in love with you
on this jungle gym.

03:30.949 --> 03:35.127
You know how much I want to do
this,
but I love you...

03:35.127 --> 03:38.261
...so if you tell me to stay,
I'll stay.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.219
Stay.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.284
Hey, Joe, hoist it up!

04:45.589 --> 04:46.895
It's got to be higher.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.592
Much higher.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.550
Higher.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.582
Mr. Green, what are you doing
here?

05:21.582 --> 05:23.497
I was just on my way to the
airport.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.672
Come here, Sam.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.892
Is Linda all right?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.372
Listen to me.

05:29.372 --> 05:32.375
Love can sometimes be
a very difficult thing.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.552
Listen up.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.119
"Dear Sam, this is the most
difficult thing
I've ever done.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.295
"I'm sorry I don't have the
courage...

05:39.295 --> 05:40.949
"...to do it face-to-face.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.343
"I never planned this, Sam."Mr. Green, what is this?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.041
She left you. I'm reading her
Dear John.

05:46.041 --> 05:50.306
"It's not you, Sam.
How can I make you understand?

05:50.306 --> 05:52.090
"Your life is set.

05:52.090 --> 05:55.137
"You have your stars
and your friends and the town,
but...

05:55.137 --> 05:57.357
"...I feel like I'm just finding
out...

05:57.357 --> 05:59.097
"...what mine is all about.

05:59.097 --> 06:03.188
"Oh, Sam, so many emotions
are surfacing as I write this."

06:04.407 --> 06:06.191
Where is she, Mr. Green?

06:06.191 --> 06:08.672
She thought it would be best
if you didn't talk for a while.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.545
Let me finish this off.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.025
"You're my best friend in the
world, Sam...

06:14.025 --> 06:16.593
"...so you must know
that this is the way I am.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.595
"I can't help it. It's my
nature."

06:18.595 --> 06:21.119
It's true, son. She's nuts.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.252
Where're you going? I'm not
finished.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.558
The best part's coming up.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.025
Would you mind just checking?

07:03.640 --> 07:06.338
Two blocks down and to the left.Thanks.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.818
I hope I'm doing the right
thing.

07:07.818 --> 07:08.993
I'm sure you are.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.696
Honey!

07:59.696 --> 08:01.742
What is it?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.700
Can you get that?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.049
I'm taking a nap.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.050
I'm in the bath.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.488
All right.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.447
I hear you, God damn it!

08:11.447 --> 08:13.057
Are you OK?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.842
What's this table doing here?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.713
This better be goddamn good!

08:16.713 --> 08:18.976
You're ruining my beauty sleep!

08:18.976 --> 08:22.893
Damn you! Lay off the buzzer!

08:22.893 --> 08:24.504
Who is it?

08:26.288 --> 08:28.029
No problem here.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.031
Who is it?

10:33.371 --> 10:35.025
Morning, everybody.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.071
Morning, Linda. Morning,
Tarzan.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.162
We are...

10:41.162 --> 10:43.730
...six minutes later than
yesterday.

10:43.730 --> 10:47.168
That's six, carry the two.
Good.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.349
Ah, there.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.785
See that?

10:55.785 --> 10:58.353
Medium smile, no teeth.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.879
Don't forget the vase.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.359
Got to get it perfectly
centered.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.448
There? No.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.884
There? No.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.369
One more. Why not?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.417
Annoying, isn't it, honey?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.246
Grin all you want, monkey man.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.728
All you are is a passing
meteor shower.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.208
You'll be gone soon enough.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.864
I feel sorry for you, you poor
bastard.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.668
Carl, it's me, Sam.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.017
Calm down. I'm fine.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.453
I'm still in New York.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.762
We're great. Linda's very
happy.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.547
We may stay a while. We're
very busy.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.592
There's lots to do.

12:05.899 --> 12:09.293
Listen, Carl, I need you to sell
my truck.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.034
Whatever you can get for it.

12:11.034 --> 12:14.168
I'm just a little short of cash
right now.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.004
I'm still here.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.657
Listen, Carl,
there's something else I need...

12:25.657 --> 12:28.617
...and Professor Wells
doesn't have to know about it.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.891
Hey, Linda. How you doing?

13:27.894 --> 13:30.157
You want to hear something
funny?

13:30.157 --> 13:33.377
I saw this on the news before I
came out.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.858
Fainting goats. I'm not making
this up.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.207
There's this breed of goats.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.080
I don't know why, but...

13:40.080 --> 13:43.257
...they faint at the slightest
thing.

13:43.257 --> 13:47.914
If they hear a loud noise
or a gun goes off...

13:47.914 --> 13:52.005
...they black out, fall right
over,
one after the other.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.361
I thought you'd like that.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.790
Get off.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.985
I don't even have a chart for
that.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.512
Get over here.

15:49.731 --> 15:50.775
Gotcha!

17:04.762 --> 17:06.329
Get away from here!

17:11.204 --> 17:14.903
I'm warning you! I have a gun!

17:14.903 --> 17:15.947
Oh, shit.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.619
What the hell are you?

17:49.807 --> 17:51.722
What do you want? Who are you?

17:51.722 --> 17:54.595
Excuse me. I asked a question.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.945
I live here. What do you want?

17:59.948 --> 18:02.081
I asked you a question.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.480
Don't touch that.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.308
Get away from that.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.792
Who the hell are you? What do
you want?

18:19.054 --> 18:20.316
They'll hear you.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.492
What are you talking about?

18:22.666 --> 18:26.366
Your little Goldilocks and my
ex-fiancÃ©.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.722
Hold it.

18:34.722 --> 18:38.595
Are you saying that guy,
that thing over there...?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.298
-What's your name?
-Mike.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.997
-What's your name, Mike?
-Sam.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.694
I'm Maggie.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.522
I'll be staying here a while.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.236
I sleep naked.
It's the only way I'm
comfortable.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.020
So don't think of it as a
come-on...

19:12.020 --> 19:13.326
...because if you so much as
breathe
in my direction...

19:13.326 --> 19:15.415
...will nail your willy to that
beam.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.984
Don't mess with my stuff,
don't get in my way...

19:19.984 --> 19:23.205
...and I'm sure we'll get along
fine.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.511
Nighty-night.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.534
What is all this stuff?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.623
Bugging equipment, cactus.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.451
Like listening bugging?

20:35.451 --> 20:36.931
Bugging who?

20:39.542 --> 20:40.935
Take a wild guess.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.939
Why would anyone want to do
that?

20:44.939 --> 20:46.941
'Cause I want to hear
what goes on in there.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.682
Don't you want to hear
what goes on in there?

20:48.682 --> 20:49.683
No, I do not.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.293
Why not?

20:51.293 --> 20:54.209
'Cause that would be
an invasion of her privacy.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.255
Excuse me, Mr. Video.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.821
That's not a video.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.301
It's a camera obscura.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.824
It's pure light.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.304
I'm not spying.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.785
I just want to be with her.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.527
That's completely different.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.180
I know how you feel.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.487
You want him back so badly
that you can't stand it.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.315
It's like your guts
are twisting around inside.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.186
But bugging their apartment....

21:15.186 --> 21:17.363
What?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.061
I don't want him back.
I want him vaporized.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.977
Extinguished!

21:22.977 --> 21:24.848
When I'm done with him...

21:24.848 --> 21:27.808
...he'll be a twitchy little
stain on the floor.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.118
Is that what you're doing?

21:34.118 --> 21:36.817
You're waiting
for her to leave him for you?

21:36.817 --> 21:37.992
Absolutely.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.559
Have you seen him?

21:39.559 --> 21:41.822
He is irrelevant.
Linda and I are soul mates.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.172
This is just a passing phase.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.044
They're going to break up
tonight.
I know it.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.176
I'm listening.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.700
I'm an astronomer.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.876
It's my job to find patterns in
things...

21:52.876 --> 21:55.270
...that seem completely random.

21:55.270 --> 21:58.273
I found a pattern.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.884
It's all in the data.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.538
The data.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.453
This data.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.108
"Mutual feeding activity."

22:07.108 --> 22:09.066
It's the number of times
that Linda and
what's-his-name...

22:09.066 --> 22:10.503
...feed each other.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.157
You're counting.Not just that. Everything.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.943
Kisses, hugs, smiles, fights.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.031
They fight?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.293
Not yet.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.730
Long looks, whispering,
shouting.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.862
They shout?

22:21.862 --> 22:23.254
You're missing the point.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.822
Tonight there's going to be a
fight.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.520
They are going to break up...

22:27.520 --> 22:29.652
...and I'm going to be right
here for her.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.785
Tonight this will all be over...

22:31.785 --> 22:35.397
...so you might as well start
packing
your bags.

22:35.397 --> 22:40.750
That is the most pathetic thing
I've ever heard.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.317
I don't mean that trivially.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.927
I'm a photographer.
I've seen a lot of things.

22:43.927 --> 22:47.104
I once took pictures
of a man who ate his own legs...

22:47.104 --> 22:48.802
...and you would be the black
sheep
of that family.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.761
What's your evil plan?
Squirt him with squirt guns?

22:51.761 --> 22:53.937
Throw rotten strawberries at
him?

22:53.937 --> 22:55.548
You looked in my satchel?

22:55.548 --> 22:57.767
Yeah. Call a cop.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.814
You are a strange, tragic little
man.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.556
Say what you want.
Linda and I are in love.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.948
Except for her boning my
boyfriend...

23:04.948 --> 23:06.863
...you guys are the perfect
couple.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.344
Listen, Catwoman, at the end of
the day...

23:09.344 --> 23:12.129
...she is coming back to me,
and we're going to be happy.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.001
And where are you going to be?

23:14.001 --> 23:16.351
All alone somewhere,
hatching some little revenge
scheme.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.312
Let me tell you something, Sam.

23:21.312 --> 23:24.664
Listen very carefully. Are you
listening?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.622
The only way that girl
is coming back to you...

23:26.622 --> 23:28.494
...is if a blast of semen
catapults her...

23:28.494 --> 23:31.018
...across the street
and through the window.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.415
I want you out.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.155
Not going to happen.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.809
I was here first.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.159
Put me down for half the rent
and get out of my face.

23:46.773 --> 23:49.384
I wouldn't do that if I were
you.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.385
Why not?

23:50.385 --> 23:51.691
You paid for it.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.784
You stole my money.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.960
You took everything I had to buy
this crap?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.657
That was everything you had?

24:01.657 --> 24:04.443
What the hell is that for,
anyway?

24:05.618 --> 24:08.185
It's pretty, Sam.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.373
There we go.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.422
You can hear them?

24:29.163 --> 24:30.425
Are they talking?

24:32.949 --> 24:33.950
What about?

24:33.950 --> 24:35.604
You wouldn't be interested.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.042
Let me hear.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.304
It's wrong, Sam.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.697
Just for a second.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.439
I just want to hear her sweet
voice.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.614
Beg me.

24:45.614 --> 24:46.659
Please.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.618
Excuse me. Did you say
something?

24:49.618 --> 24:50.924
Please let me hear.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.059
Oh, my God.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.887
He's killing her.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.236
He's killing her, all right...

24:59.236 --> 25:01.151
...and she's loving every minute
of it.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.023
She's not like that.

25:03.023 --> 25:06.505
She likes to make love quiet
and slow and gentle.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.551
That girl of yours is a carnival
ride.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.379
This is horrible.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.250
This is worse than I'd imagined.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.338
Want me to turn it off?

25:14.338 --> 25:16.340
No. I need to hear it.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.168
How very brave.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.702
He's making love to her in
French.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.922
You know, Sam,
French men are very small.

25:32.922 --> 25:36.186
But not this guy.
It's like Godzilla's tail.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.232
He could take down Tokyo with
that thing.

25:38.232 --> 25:42.105
This has got to be
the longest orgasm I've heard.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.238
You want your charts?

25:44.238 --> 25:47.023
You enjoy making me suffer.

25:49.286 --> 25:50.592
Help me get him, Sam.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.463
Take the road less traveled.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.422
It'll make all the difference.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.293
Forget it.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.600
I will not get sucked into your
nightmare.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.907
Whatever.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.474
I think I can get this in
stereo.

26:07.609 --> 26:11.047
Welcome to New York, spy-boy.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.987
Slim Jim?

26:37.987 --> 26:40.686
Let's see what Ken and Barbie
are having tonight.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.385
Squab.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.171
He marinates it for half a day
in a lemon-wine sauce...

26:48.171 --> 26:49.912
...and he braises it with sugar.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.958
Please be quiet. I have to
concentrate.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.003
It's happening tonight.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.396
Smells delicious.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.311
I'll tell you a secret.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.747
It's not my recipe.

27:00.009 --> 27:03.534
I met an old man, and he said...

27:03.534 --> 27:06.537
...only prepare it for the woman
you love.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.975
Later I found out he made it
for a party he catered.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.586
Five hundred people.
He's just bursting with love.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.501
You should go to his restaurant
sometime.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.937
Good food, good people.

27:14.937 --> 27:18.637
Wait. Take the spoon like this.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.639
Just let her eat it, you maggot!

27:25.861 --> 27:28.516
It's the best thing I've ever
eaten.

27:28.516 --> 27:31.171
Will you shut up?

27:31.171 --> 27:32.955
I love to watch you eat.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.090
She hates having people watch
her eat.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.874
He's going down in flames.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.746
Here it comes.

27:40.746 --> 27:44.010
Oh, you know,
I heard the most amusing story.

27:44.010 --> 27:47.535
There is this...what are they
called?

27:47.535 --> 27:48.667
Sheep.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.538
Yeah. A breed of goats.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.975
And when they hear a sharp
sound,
they fall over.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.890
A sharp sound?

27:54.890 --> 27:56.326
Yeah. Anything.

27:56.326 --> 28:00.548
You clap your hands, and they
fall over.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.202
That's my story.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.117
They pass out
when they hear a sharp sound.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.771
It's true.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.512
They just fall over on the
ground.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.210
That's my kiss.

28:11.602 --> 28:12.995
That's my....

28:19.915 --> 28:21.700
Oh, not the food.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.838
I'll do it.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.274
I'll do whatever you want.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.885
This has to stop.

28:32.885 --> 28:35.061
I don't care about right or
wrong anymore.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.324
This must stop.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.114
All you gotta do is nudge him.

28:45.114 --> 28:47.029
Just graze him like that.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.224
Sorry.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.665
You're sorry?
You should be goddamned sorry.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.581
You think you can trample
a person and say you're sorry?

29:17.581 --> 29:19.366
Well, you can't.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.325
You can't trample on somebody's
life and say, "I'm sorry."

29:22.325 --> 29:24.763
There ought to be
something more you can say...

29:24.763 --> 29:27.504
...when you walk all over
somebody.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.637
And you're throwing food
everywhere!

29:43.042 --> 29:45.784
I think we took a detour
from the plan there.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.307
I really hit him, didn't I?

29:47.307 --> 29:49.483
You smacked him one, all right!

29:49.483 --> 29:50.440
How'd it feel?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.660
Great!

29:52.660 --> 29:55.489
What is your plan?
What do you want to do?

29:55.489 --> 29:57.926
I just want his dignity, that's
all.

29:57.926 --> 30:00.711
I want him penniless, hopeless,
loveless, finished off.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.018
I just wish him very, very ill.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.368
How ill are we talking here?

30:05.368 --> 30:07.544
I'm not saying I want him dead.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.851
But, should that occur,
people die all the time.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.679
Why should he be any different?

30:12.201 --> 30:13.724
Just thinking on my feet,
though.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
I don't have to decide
the death part right now.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.902
I can wait and see how I feel...

30:16.902 --> 30:19.208
...once his dignity's a thing of
the past.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.514
Am I boring you?

30:20.514 --> 30:22.124
Thank you, Anton.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.390
Maybe I shouldn't have hit him.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.479
He's just in love.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.700
He's just in love, the same as
me.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.223
Define love.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.009
Why?

30:37.009 --> 30:38.575
Because every other word
out of you mouth is "love."

30:38.575 --> 30:39.968
I'd like to know what it is...

30:39.968 --> 30:42.144
...this magical ideal of yours.
Define it.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.799
Well, it's like, I don't know.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.540
It's like all your life you walk
around...

30:46.540 --> 30:49.195
...with this feeling of
emptiness
in your stomach.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.110
You feel completely hollow.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.722
And when you're in love, you
feel...

30:54.722 --> 30:56.376
...not hollow.

31:00.771 --> 31:03.252
It's like without it, there's
nothing.

31:03.252 --> 31:06.081
A shell. A cavernous emptiness.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.344
Forget it. You can't define it.

31:09.606 --> 31:12.044
When I was a kid, my father had
this dog.

31:12.044 --> 31:14.785
It started to get weak and
sickly
so he took it to the vet.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.570
The doctor examines it and
says...

31:16.570 --> 31:18.833
...a maggot must've laid eggs
in the dog's butt.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.966
He says there's not much they
can do.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.404
The baby maggots have crawled up
and started to grow...

31:24.404 --> 31:28.321
...and eventually they're going
to eat
the dog alive from the inside
out.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.759
He says it should be put to
sleep
because it's an old dog, anyway.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.326
But Father won't do it.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.675
He takes it home.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.155
He puts it on the bed.

31:36.155 --> 31:38.026
He starts to reach up into the
dog...

31:38.026 --> 31:41.987
...picking out the maggots with
his fingers,
one by one.

31:41.987 --> 31:45.251
It takes him all night,
but he gets every last one.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.689
That dog outlived my father.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.953
That's love, Sam.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.960
You're not that tough, Maggie.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.180
I can tell you're not that
tough.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.270
And you can forget
about a career with Hallmark.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.320
Won't he miss the card?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.756
He won't know what hit him
till the bill comes...

32:12.756 --> 32:14.976
...'cause he only uses his
platinum.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.853
I'll just take everything in
this whole area.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.596
You know Anton's having an
affair?

32:26.596 --> 32:27.902
He is?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.860
That's what Linda's going to
think.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.731
Where are you sending them?

32:30.731 --> 32:32.298
To my Nana.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.169
The old battle-ax
should get a kick out of this.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.868
How much to put lipstick on the
monkey?

32:37.868 --> 32:40.001
Is that for you or for him?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.611
I don't touch the monkey.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.179
I don't want to have anything
to do with the monkey.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.746
How's 40?

32:45.746 --> 32:49.576
For 50 I'd strap on a garter
and wax her legs.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.057
Lovely lipstick, darling.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.754
Honey, you can't be treating me
this way.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.538
We've known each other too long.

32:55.538 --> 32:57.801
You can't even look me in the
eye.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.021
What? You're in love?

33:01.196 --> 33:04.069
You're in love with that man?

33:04.069 --> 33:06.680
That man could never make you
happy.

33:09.770 --> 33:12.468
What the hell is that? Shit!

33:12.468 --> 33:14.209
Good God! Kiss him, baby!

33:14.209 --> 33:16.516
Get this goddamned monkey off my
back!

33:25.046 --> 33:26.265
Give that man a hand!

33:26.265 --> 33:28.354
OK, that's fine.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.877
No problem.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.968
Greta thanks you. I thank you.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.766
Hello, sweetheart.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.551
Here we go. The target's home.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.553
You know bankers.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.556
They want to know every little
thing.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.775
What do they know
about the restaurant business?

33:58.775 --> 34:01.082
Are we packed?

34:01.082 --> 34:03.432
Hey, why don't we forget
about the Hamptons...

34:03.432 --> 34:05.260
...and spend the weekend in bed?

34:05.260 --> 34:06.522
There, that look!

34:06.522 --> 34:08.524
She sees it.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.355
Stay with her.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.010
Go back to her, Sam!

34:16.010 --> 34:17.011
Stick to her.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.795
Relax.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.406
Anything you wanted to tell me?

34:20.406 --> 34:22.234
What?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.802
What's that on your collar?

34:25.802 --> 34:28.675
Turn it up. I can't hear them.

34:28.675 --> 34:29.937
Oh, that.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.983
You'll never believe this.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.811
I'm walking through Washington
Square...

34:34.811 --> 34:36.030
...and there's this stupid man.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.336
You know, some guy with a
monkey.

34:37.336 --> 34:40.034
A street performer?

34:40.034 --> 34:41.557
That son of a bitch, yeah.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.429
The monkey jumps on me
and won't get off my back.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.648
You're kidding.

34:45.648 --> 34:49.087
The people all around, they are
laughing.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.350
And the monkey is kissing me,
kissing me.

34:51.350 --> 34:54.222
I think it peed on me. It
stinks.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.659
What is she laughing at?

34:56.659 --> 34:58.618
I don't know.

34:58.618 --> 35:01.273
What do you think of the story?
I'll show you what I think.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.796
I'll get you.

35:15.722 --> 35:18.072
Let's forget about the Hamptons.

35:18.072 --> 35:21.031
It's going very well, don't you
think?

35:21.031 --> 35:23.643
Drink up, buddy,
'cause tonight we're going in.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.602
There they go.

35:26.602 --> 35:29.170
We want to go to the Long Island
railroad.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.001
Idiot never even changed the
lock.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.094
Close it.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.146
It's so much smaller than it
looks on TV.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.480
In the couch.What?

36:18.480 --> 36:20.395
In the couch. Don't make it
obvious.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.528
-You're kidding.
-Just do it.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.486
Why were you wearing them?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.793
Authenticity.

36:48.684 --> 36:49.903
What are you going to do?

36:49.903 --> 36:51.600
Receipts.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.080
Why are we whispering?

36:53.080 --> 36:54.386
I don't know.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.198
Mine.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.275
Mine.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.547
Mine.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.114
Mine.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.727
Perfection, yes?

38:17.033 --> 38:18.034
[WE] VoilÃ .[WE]

38:23.779 --> 38:25.303
This is comfortable.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.398
This is what you wear to walk
about...

38:33.398 --> 38:35.356
...with everything swinging
freely.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.015
Look at me. I am so fabulous.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.712
I am so beautiful.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.714
Witness my matted chest hairs.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.237
They are nice, no?

38:56.812 --> 38:58.466
What do you think?

39:02.427 --> 39:04.211
You look....

39:27.713 --> 39:29.192
Look at this.

40:42.483 --> 40:45.181
I love you, Linda.

40:45.181 --> 40:47.096
I hate you, Anton.

40:54.234 --> 40:56.410
I got to make the bed.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.461
Sure. Right.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.522
Can you clean the kitchen?

41:21.522 --> 41:23.306
We should get out of here.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.658
I think we should talk.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.704
Nothing to talk about.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.533
Yes, there is. Something
happened.
I would like to talk about it.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.317
Nothing happened, Sam.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.494
OK? Nothing happened.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.234
I know what you're going
through.

41:38.234 --> 41:39.671
I'm going through the same
thing.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.847
Get this straight, pal. I'm not
like you.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.892
I don't care what you're going
through.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.112
If I thought you and I were
alike
in the most trivial way...

41:46.112 --> 41:48.114
...I would tie a rope around my
neck.

42:22.409 --> 42:23.628
I'm sorry.

42:43.473 --> 42:45.606
Last night wasn't us, Maggie.

42:45.606 --> 42:48.566
I know. I'm glad you know.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.873
Maybe we should just,
I don't know, call it a day.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.928
You know what's going to happen
to her,
Sam?

43:02.928 --> 43:06.845
He's going to make her feel
like she's the only woman in the
world.

43:06.845 --> 43:09.238
When he looks at her,
it'll be just like a kid...

43:09.238 --> 43:13.068
...looks at a Christmas tree
all lit up and shiny.

43:13.199 --> 43:18.073
For the first time,
she'll feel like she's really
been seen...

43:18.073 --> 43:20.380
...and really loved.

43:20.380 --> 43:21.773
And then...

43:24.210 --> 43:28.040
...and then three weeks later...

43:28.040 --> 43:30.042
...she'll find a pair of panties
in the couch.

43:30.042 --> 43:32.566
Then she'll learn that she was
just a steppingstone.

43:32.566 --> 43:35.351
That he was just using her to
get a visa.

43:42.358 --> 43:44.012
It'll change her, Sam.

43:52.194 --> 43:54.240
I understand.

43:55.371 --> 43:57.635
You know what's always bothered
me?

43:59.027 --> 44:02.204
I can't see the side of her
face.

44:02.204 --> 44:05.120
I can never see the left side of
her face...

44:05.120 --> 44:07.340
...when she's standing here
in the kitchen...

44:07.340 --> 44:09.603
...because of these things in
the window.

44:09.603 --> 44:11.649
So help me move this over a
little bit.

44:16.175 --> 44:17.219
Good?

44:17.219 --> 44:18.525
A little more.

44:20.745 --> 44:21.702
Good.

44:38.023 --> 44:40.199
What?

44:40.199 --> 44:43.855
I saw the sign about the job.

44:43.855 --> 44:45.552
I don't want a half salt shaker
on the table.

44:45.552 --> 44:47.293
You go and refill it
immediately.

44:47.293 --> 44:49.077
Pardon.

44:49.077 --> 44:51.427
Il faut tout leur apprendre!

44:51.427 --> 44:53.516
Nothing here for you. Go.

44:53.516 --> 44:54.692
Why?

44:59.566 --> 45:01.873
Do I need a reason in my own
restaurant?

45:01.873 --> 45:03.352
Of course not.

45:03.352 --> 45:04.440
I don't like your face, that's
why.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.703
Just go.

45:19.934 --> 45:21.240
Wait.

45:22.589 --> 45:24.460
Why did you do that?

45:24.460 --> 45:26.549
Why did I do what?

45:26.549 --> 45:28.813
The flowers.
Why did you move it like that?

45:28.813 --> 45:31.032
I wanted them to be
in the middle of the table.

45:31.032 --> 45:32.860
Why?

45:32.860 --> 45:34.296
Because it was...

45:34.296 --> 45:36.821
...it was just something that I
had to do.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.129
Perhaps at heart you seek
perfection, no?

45:41.129 --> 45:42.957
Yes, perhaps I do.

46:01.454 --> 46:03.064
Almost done?

46:06.459 --> 46:08.591
Almost.

46:08.591 --> 46:10.593
Good work.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.946
Why don't you stop for a moment?

46:22.170 --> 46:24.651
I know who you are.

46:24.651 --> 46:28.655
It took me a little while, but I
figure it out.

46:33.094 --> 46:35.009
Dry off your hands.

46:39.535 --> 46:41.320
It was you who attacked me that
day.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.888
Couldn't see your eyes,
but I don't forget a face.

46:43.888 --> 46:47.369
You didn't put an address down
on your application.

46:47.369 --> 46:50.329
You are homeless, aren't you?

46:50.329 --> 46:51.678
That's OK. Don't be ashamed.

46:51.678 --> 46:53.071
You know, I was hungry myself
once.

46:53.071 --> 46:55.334
I would see a rich man, a man I
envied...

46:55.334 --> 46:57.858
...I would want to strangle him.

46:57.858 --> 46:59.729
But that's not the way I found.

46:59.729 --> 47:01.514
You must better yourself.

47:01.514 --> 47:02.863
Don't be ashamed.

47:02.863 --> 47:05.518
Give me your hand. Come on.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.957
I like a man who fights for what
he wants.

47:09.957 --> 47:12.351
But if you ever mess with me
again...

47:12.351 --> 47:15.833
...I'll rip out your eyes and
rape your skull.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.747
Excuse my French.

47:17.747 --> 47:20.011
Was a good punch, huh?

47:20.011 --> 47:21.621
Solid.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.666
It was nice.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.278
So you did all his dishes
and got punched in the face.

47:26.278 --> 47:27.670
What was your thinking there?

47:27.670 --> 47:30.935
I'm missing something.
What was your plan?

47:30.935 --> 47:33.720
No plan. I just wanted to face
him.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.983
I wanted to be
in the same room with him...

47:35.983 --> 47:37.419
...to talk to him.

47:37.419 --> 47:40.205
In my mind, he was like a god.

47:40.205 --> 47:42.033
Now what do you think?

47:42.033 --> 47:44.774
Well, it's not like he's God God
anymore.

47:44.774 --> 47:48.778
He's more like a volcano god or
a sea god.

47:48.778 --> 47:51.346
One of those sub-gods.

47:51.346 --> 47:53.522
Maggie, I think he likes me.

47:56.351 --> 47:59.050
One thing, though.

47:59.050 --> 48:02.314
He said something
about having sex with my skull.

48:02.314 --> 48:03.532
He says that to everybody.

48:03.532 --> 48:05.230
Don't worry about it.

48:07.406 --> 48:09.016
Sorry.

48:09.016 --> 48:11.976
I don't like the sound of it.

48:11.976 --> 48:13.978
I don't like the image that it
conjures.

48:13.978 --> 48:16.371
I can't honestly say I blame
you, Sam.

48:21.986 --> 48:24.162
So I let go with my hands...

48:24.162 --> 48:26.991
...and I fell off the top
of the jungle gym face-first...

48:26.991 --> 48:29.471
...and I broke this tooth in
half.

48:29.471 --> 48:32.431
I'm laying on my back,
blood all over my face...

48:32.431 --> 48:34.955
...the kids are yelling,
the teachers are freaking out...

48:34.955 --> 48:37.131
...and I look up, and there she
is.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.959
She's just looking down at me...

48:38.959 --> 48:41.440
...with this worried little
smile on her face.

48:41.440 --> 48:45.487
I swear to God, when I saw her,
the pain just went away.

48:45.487 --> 48:47.794
Once I took pictures
of a bunch of ducklings...

48:47.794 --> 48:49.578
...who imprinted on a gardener.

48:49.578 --> 48:51.537
They thought he was Mama...

48:51.537 --> 48:53.060
...and they used to chase him
around
all day...

48:53.060 --> 48:56.498
...while he drove around
on his lawn mower.

48:56.498 --> 48:57.760
That's exactly what it feels
like.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.937
It's like she's branded on my
brain.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.590
What happened to this guy...

49:01.590 --> 49:04.245
...is that one day he forgot
the ducks were there.

49:04.245 --> 49:07.379
He put the mower in reverse,
chewed them to pieces.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.948
Don't you know any happy
stories?

49:12.471 --> 49:14.038
There he is.

49:18.129 --> 49:20.044
That's him!

49:20.044 --> 49:21.393
Let's get him!

49:29.401 --> 49:30.837
Our work is done.

49:39.672 --> 49:41.891
Midgets coming out of the blue.

49:41.891 --> 49:44.459
I had to protect myself with one
of them.

49:44.459 --> 49:46.070
Midgets coming out of the blue?

49:46.070 --> 49:49.334
Yeah.
Little children shooting perfume
at me.

49:50.378 --> 49:51.814
From their guns.

49:51.814 --> 49:53.729
Perfume from their guns?

49:53.729 --> 49:55.644
Yeah. Water guns?

49:55.644 --> 49:56.776
Squirt guns?

49:56.776 --> 49:58.560
Yeah, I think. Squirt guns.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.040
Spooky, huh?

50:00.040 --> 50:02.521
Wait, the loaf, I think it's
burning.

50:02.521 --> 50:05.045
Look at him trying
to weasel his way out of it.

50:05.045 --> 50:06.655
He didn't do anything, Sam.

50:06.655 --> 50:09.571
Anton, don't you think it's a
little peculiar...

50:09.571 --> 50:12.531
...that little children would be
shooting
perfume at you?

50:12.531 --> 50:15.403
I thought it was something
American kids do.

50:15.403 --> 50:17.492
A fad, I don't know.
We should have some salad.

50:17.492 --> 50:20.582
It's very expensive perfume,
Anton.

50:20.582 --> 50:22.323
I used to wear that perfume.

50:22.323 --> 50:24.717
Good call, Sam!

50:27.198 --> 50:30.027
Last week you had lipstick on
your collar.

50:31.332 --> 50:32.768
From the monkey.

50:34.770 --> 50:37.382
And now perfume...

50:37.382 --> 50:40.167
...from squirt guns
from rich New York kids.

50:40.167 --> 50:41.821
What are the odds...

50:41.821 --> 50:43.475
...of something like that
happening to one person?

50:43.475 --> 50:45.303
I don't know. Ask a
mathematician.

50:45.303 --> 50:47.261
Ask your old boyfriend,
the Milky Way man.

50:47.261 --> 50:48.871
That's you, Sam.

50:48.871 --> 50:51.613
What are you getting at?
You're driving me crazy.

50:51.613 --> 50:54.747
Anton,
I want you to promise me
something.

50:54.747 --> 50:58.968
Just promise that if you were
ever doing anything...

50:58.968 --> 51:01.232
...that you would tell me.

51:04.800 --> 51:08.108
Why are you even thinking of
such a thing?

51:08.108 --> 51:09.631
Maybe we could work it out.

51:09.631 --> 51:12.808
I just couldn't take it
if you were lying to me.

51:12.808 --> 51:17.030
Sweetie,
why would I have sex with a
hamburger...

51:17.030 --> 51:20.207
...when I can make love to a
steak?

51:20.207 --> 51:22.470
Oh, come on.

51:22.470 --> 51:24.124
Forget about it.

51:24.124 --> 51:26.909
She's this close, Sam.

51:26.909 --> 51:28.868
This close.

51:35.309 --> 51:37.833
Bring some cups and saucers.

51:37.833 --> 51:39.705
And bring some other bottles.

51:46.494 --> 51:47.495
What did I miss?

51:47.495 --> 51:49.062
I think we're getting to them.

51:49.062 --> 51:51.282
I definitely think
that we're getting to them.

51:51.282 --> 51:53.675
Did you get the sweet and sour?

51:53.675 --> 51:55.634
Look, my darling...

51:55.634 --> 51:58.027
...I wanted to show you
how well my hands fit on my
knees...

51:58.027 --> 51:59.551
...and to give you a little
kiss.

51:59.551 --> 52:02.510
Get away from me, please. You
are rude.

52:02.510 --> 52:05.296
But I love you, my little lamb.
I must have you.

52:05.296 --> 52:09.648
My love is throbbing
at quite a fevered cadence.

52:09.648 --> 52:11.040
You cannot have me.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.086
My love is reserved for another.

52:13.086 --> 52:14.740
You cannot mean....

52:14.740 --> 52:16.872
Yes, the Milky Way man!

52:16.872 --> 52:19.527
No! Anyone but him.

52:20.572 --> 52:24.097
This is a man who can predict
puffer cluster emissions.

52:24.097 --> 52:26.012
To him I am nothing.

52:26.012 --> 52:29.189
A little, teeny...I'm a worm.

52:29.189 --> 52:31.148
I love his emissions.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.845
Not every man...

52:34.194 --> 52:36.892
...can be a Milky Way man.

52:36.892 --> 52:38.938
What will you do now?

52:38.938 --> 52:43.377
Forlorn, I will roam the earth
by myself,
thinking of you...

52:43.377 --> 52:46.859
...and pausing occasionally to
have the sex with the skullses.

52:49.035 --> 52:50.732
That's good.

52:50.732 --> 52:52.517
Now be quiet about that...

52:52.517 --> 52:55.868
...or I will make you eat
another one of those pecans!

52:55.868 --> 52:58.044
This is very good.

52:58.044 --> 53:00.220
Look how I'm licking my fingers.
You like that?

53:00.220 --> 53:02.353
I like everything. I am French.

53:06.531 --> 53:07.619
Ordering!

53:12.101 --> 53:15.017
I've been dying for one of these
all night.

53:16.062 --> 53:18.847
Can I ask you a question, Anton?

53:18.847 --> 53:20.371
Sure you can.

53:22.068 --> 53:24.157
How do you like America?

53:24.157 --> 53:25.550
Why do you ask?

53:25.550 --> 53:27.247
You're French.

53:27.769 --> 53:29.206
Do you ever miss it?

53:29.206 --> 53:31.208
Do you ever get lonely
for your own country?

53:31.208 --> 53:33.645
I was never so much French
since I've been here.

53:33.645 --> 53:37.083
You know Superman?

53:37.083 --> 53:39.128
That's me, I'm Superman.

53:41.827 --> 53:44.046
And France was like Krypton.

53:44.046 --> 53:46.440
On Krypton everybody was
Superman.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.746
You make a nice sauce.

53:47.746 --> 53:49.530
Everybody make a nice sauce.

53:49.530 --> 53:51.837
You say hello to a nice woman
with your French accent...

53:51.837 --> 53:54.100
...and everybody says, "Hello!"

53:56.885 --> 54:00.106
But here on Earth, the moment I
arrived...

54:00.106 --> 54:02.848
...I knew this was the place
I had special powers.

54:02.848 --> 54:04.676
I talk about my little town...

54:04.676 --> 54:06.330
...and the bankers open their
checkbooks
and say...

54:06.330 --> 54:09.333
..."How great, charming,
and exotic you are, Anton."

54:09.333 --> 54:11.509
I could read the phone book to a
woman...

54:11.509 --> 54:15.817
...and they become hypnotized,
wet as morning daisies.

54:15.817 --> 54:17.384
Here I have these powers.

54:17.384 --> 54:18.907
Back home, I was nothing.

54:18.907 --> 54:20.518
But here, I'm Superman.

54:20.518 --> 54:23.825
Hip-hip, America!
Hip-hip, land of freedom!

54:23.825 --> 54:26.480
Now you, you're not French.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.003
But it's OK, you know?

54:28.003 --> 54:30.571
You still have opportunity in
this country.

54:30.571 --> 54:33.095
Yesterday, he had no job, no
future.

54:33.095 --> 54:34.271
But today, a step-up.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.099
A little step, but a step.

54:37.099 --> 54:39.667
Soon you can afford a place
to live and get a girlfriend.

54:39.667 --> 54:41.234
I have a girlfriend.

54:41.234 --> 54:43.671
No, really. Pretty girl?

54:43.671 --> 54:47.153
She's the most wonderful woman
in the world.

54:47.153 --> 54:48.807
She must love you a good deal.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.809
You think women only want men
for their money?

54:50.809 --> 54:52.332
No, not just money.

54:52.332 --> 54:53.812
Power also, and success.

54:53.812 --> 54:55.204
Don't fool yourself, dishwasher.

54:55.204 --> 54:57.337
They want a man
who takes what he wants.

54:57.337 --> 54:59.470
I don't think that's true.

55:01.820 --> 55:03.300
Listen.

55:04.649 --> 55:08.174
My girlfriend was seeing a man
when I met her.

55:08.174 --> 55:11.873
I took her back to my place,
and I ask her about him...

55:11.873 --> 55:14.223
...very innocently, of course.Of course.

55:14.223 --> 55:16.530
She had many wonderful things
to say about him.

55:16.530 --> 55:20.229
How nice and devoted, how gentle
he was.

55:20.229 --> 55:23.058
So I started to probe in very
subtle ways...

55:23.058 --> 55:26.018
...about how strong, powerful,
and successful he was.

55:26.018 --> 55:27.672
I was very good.

55:27.672 --> 55:30.849
In no time,
we were lying together on my
couch.

55:30.849 --> 55:34.722
I think she wanted me
to force her away from him.

55:34.722 --> 55:35.810
You could see it in her eyes.

55:35.810 --> 55:37.508
She wanted the battle.

55:37.508 --> 55:41.555
She was crying, too,
but she was kissing me.

55:41.555 --> 55:44.341
Later, of course, she came like
a rocket.

55:47.256 --> 55:48.736
Don't worry about the glass.

55:48.736 --> 55:51.565
I won't charge you this time.

55:51.565 --> 55:53.959
Anton, he's here. Matheson.

55:53.959 --> 55:56.701
Matheson? Are you sure?

55:56.701 --> 55:58.529
Table nine.

56:00.748 --> 56:02.837
Oh, my God. It's him.

56:02.837 --> 56:04.273
Go.

56:04.273 --> 56:06.232
I'll take care of him.

56:30.909 --> 56:32.693
Did you bring them?

56:32.693 --> 56:35.261
What I just did was the most
revolting thing I've ever done.

56:35.261 --> 56:37.611
Harold Matheson,
the food critic for the Times.

56:37.611 --> 56:40.266
Big step.
Are you sure you're ready for
this?

56:41.267 --> 56:43.791
Everyone!

56:43.791 --> 56:45.967
I want everyone to do a good job
tonight.

56:45.967 --> 56:48.056
I want everything perfect.

56:48.056 --> 56:49.623
Didier, I can see this is not
good!

56:49.623 --> 56:52.452
And you, dishwasher,
you don't drop a dish tonight.

56:52.452 --> 56:54.846
I want everything perfect for
the bastard.

56:54.846 --> 56:56.761
Heaven for the pig.

57:00.939 --> 57:02.375
Gimme, gimme.

57:05.291 --> 57:07.119
I've created a monster.

57:12.516 --> 57:15.519
I asked your steward for a
Chenin Blanc...

57:15.519 --> 57:18.347
...and he brought me this.

57:18.347 --> 57:21.525
You have any idea how that
happened?

57:21.525 --> 57:22.700
I took the liberty, Mr.
Matheson.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.919
It's from my private reserve.

57:24.919 --> 57:27.879
You know, if I had a suspicious
mind...

57:27.879 --> 57:31.230
...I'd think you're trying to
get
on my good side.

57:31.230 --> 57:33.537
I thought you would enjoy the
year.

57:33.537 --> 57:38.629
I'd say that your little ruse
is working very well...

57:38.629 --> 57:42.415
...especially if you could
locate
another bottle.

57:42.415 --> 57:43.764
Well, certainly. Excuse me.

57:44.939 --> 57:48.116
We might find a bottle or two.

57:49.422 --> 57:52.033
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Matheson.

57:52.033 --> 57:54.862
I've just come back from France.

57:54.862 --> 57:56.821
Whereabouts are you from?

57:58.170 --> 57:59.911
It's just Beaucaire.

57:59.911 --> 58:02.696
It's just a small province
in the south of France.

58:02.696 --> 58:05.525
Oh, Beaucaire.

58:05.525 --> 58:08.441
I know that. Isn't that near
NÃ®mes?

58:08.441 --> 58:10.704
Is that near NÃ®mes?

58:10.704 --> 58:12.010
Excuse me?

58:12.010 --> 58:14.534
Is that near NÃ®mes?

58:15.883 --> 58:17.319
Yes, it's near there.

58:18.973 --> 58:20.366
Oh, my God!

58:20.366 --> 58:21.498
Did you see that?

58:21.498 --> 58:22.977
I remember.

58:22.977 --> 58:27.765
It's a little to the south and
over the hill.

58:27.765 --> 58:31.377
Yes, it is on the other side of
the hill.

58:31.377 --> 58:32.683
It's a little south.

59:19.294 --> 59:20.600
The look on Matheson's face.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.123
What are you smiling about?

59:22.123 --> 59:23.734
I'm sorry.

59:23.734 --> 59:26.127
Its legs were fighting
in his mouth like this.

59:26.127 --> 59:29.304
Everything I had is in that
restaurant.

59:29.304 --> 59:32.307
It's not that bad. I have my
job.

59:32.307 --> 59:35.484
Your teacher's salary
won't pay for the toilet paper!

59:35.484 --> 59:37.791
That's because they don't
pay teachers what they're worth.

59:37.791 --> 59:39.053
In some parts of the world--

59:39.053 --> 59:40.838
Linda, don't go there.

59:40.838 --> 59:43.710
Do you mind if we don't have
this discussion again right now?

59:43.710 --> 59:45.103
Thank you, Anton.

59:46.321 --> 59:48.193
-Don't be angry.
-I'm not angry.

59:48.193 --> 59:49.629
She's angry.

59:49.629 --> 59:51.326
What if they close me down
permanently?

59:51.326 --> 59:53.372
What would you do?

59:53.372 --> 59:56.767
What do you mean?

59:56.767 --> 1:00:00.118
I mean,
if I couldn't afford this nice
place anymore?

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:03.338
You can always find work.

1:00:03.338 --> 1:00:05.950
You can go back to modeling--

1:00:05.950 --> 1:00:08.735
He was a model?

1:00:08.735 --> 1:00:11.390
What if I couldn't find work?

1:00:11.390 --> 1:00:12.783
Then what?

1:00:14.567 --> 1:00:17.483
What would you do if I were
poor?

1:00:21.922 --> 1:00:25.752
I would sit out on the curb
with you all day...

1:00:25.752 --> 1:00:27.885
...and sell pencils.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:30.888
Then when it got dark, we would
crawl...

1:00:30.888 --> 1:00:36.589
...into our cozy refrigerator
box
and make love all night...

1:00:36.589 --> 1:00:39.636
...and then sell pencils again
at sun-up.

1:00:44.989 --> 1:00:47.339
Where are you going?Where's he going?

1:00:47.339 --> 1:00:48.688
What's he doing?

1:00:50.472 --> 1:00:51.865
Talk to me.

1:00:51.865 --> 1:00:53.780
He's getting something off of a
shelf.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:55.434
What is it?

1:00:55.434 --> 1:00:57.697
It's a ring. Oh, no!

1:00:57.697 --> 1:00:58.959
What does it look like?

1:00:58.959 --> 1:01:00.569
It's a circle of diamonds with
a....

1:01:00.569 --> 1:01:03.050
A big, fat opal in the middle?

1:01:03.050 --> 1:01:05.226
I'm familiar with it.

1:01:05.226 --> 1:01:07.359
Ton visage, ton corps...

1:01:07.359 --> 1:01:08.708
...tu es Ã  moi,
je suis Ã  toi.

1:01:08.708 --> 1:01:10.362
Je t'aime, mon amour.

1:01:10.362 --> 1:01:11.711
What is that?

1:01:11.711 --> 1:01:13.626
-The bastard.
-What?

1:01:18.544 --> 1:01:20.502
Would you like to be my wife?

1:01:56.495 --> 1:01:57.496
Here.

1:02:04.111 --> 1:02:06.157
Nana!

1:02:06.157 --> 1:02:07.898
So you found me.

1:02:08.986 --> 1:02:13.294
I get 50 pounds of flowers
delivered to my door...

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:15.470
...and I call the florist...

1:02:15.470 --> 1:02:19.648
...and he gives me your name
and this charming address...

1:02:19.648 --> 1:02:22.651
...and the earrings and the
perfume...

1:02:22.651 --> 1:02:24.610
...and the television set, for
Christ's sake.

1:02:24.610 --> 1:02:27.874
What's got into your head, girl?

1:02:27.874 --> 1:02:29.441
Too much? You didn't like them?

1:02:29.441 --> 1:02:32.226
It's one thing not to call
your mother for ages...

1:02:32.226 --> 1:02:34.228
...but to hide from me for two
months.

1:02:34.228 --> 1:02:36.404
You better be found
lying dead in the gutter...

1:02:36.404 --> 1:02:38.406
...if you know what's good for
you.

1:02:38.406 --> 1:02:41.235
What is that?
Your tits look like hard little
rocks.

1:02:41.235 --> 1:02:44.325
Cut it out.

1:02:44.325 --> 1:02:47.502
As for you...

1:02:47.502 --> 1:02:50.984
...taking my little girl away
from me.

1:02:50.984 --> 1:02:52.551
Come here now!

1:02:59.819 --> 1:03:01.516
I'm Margaret's Nana.

1:03:01.516 --> 1:03:04.693
It's such a pleasure to finally
meet you,
Anton.

1:03:08.045 --> 1:03:10.395
I'm very happy to finally be
meeting you,
too.

1:03:10.395 --> 1:03:14.312
If we hurry,
we can get you some vanilla
custard...

1:03:14.312 --> 1:03:16.401
...at Di Roberti's before it
closes.

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:20.318
The spoon goes in right side up,
dear.

1:03:20.318 --> 1:03:22.886
We weren't brought up in a barn.

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:25.802
Nana, you got something
in your teeth right here.

1:03:27.455 --> 1:03:29.022
Here, hand them to me.

1:03:29.022 --> 1:03:30.632
Oh, you little bitch!

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:34.593
Oh, dear, it's late.

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:36.943
I think I better be getting
home.

1:03:36.943 --> 1:03:38.292
You have to go already?

1:03:38.292 --> 1:03:40.773
I've got a yoga class in the
morning.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:42.601
But first, I want to take your
picture.

1:03:42.601 --> 1:03:43.950
Move in closer.

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:48.825
Put your arm around her, Anton.

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:50.914
Put your arm around her.

1:03:50.914 --> 1:03:53.133
Maggie, don't make a face.

1:03:53.133 --> 1:03:54.700
I'm not.

1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:56.397
She always makes a face
when you take her picture.

1:03:56.397 --> 1:03:57.355
I do not.

1:03:58.530 --> 1:04:01.794
For Pete's sake, just act
natural.

1:04:01.794 --> 1:04:04.101
Why don't you give her a kiss,
Anton?

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:08.409
It's my mistake.

1:04:09.584 --> 1:04:11.456
Don't be shy. Come on.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:17.288
You can do better than that,
Anton.

1:04:17.288 --> 1:04:20.204
Yeah, Anton, you can do better
than that.

1:04:25.296 --> 1:04:28.821
Did you see a flash?

1:04:28.821 --> 1:04:31.911
God, I hate these things.

1:04:31.911 --> 1:04:33.043
Come on, kiss.

1:04:42.139 --> 1:04:45.664
All right, Maggie, dear,
will you take care of the check?

1:04:52.758 --> 1:04:54.412
Just spend the night with us.

1:04:54.412 --> 1:04:56.153
In that Bohemian hell hole?

1:04:56.153 --> 1:04:59.199
How long were you in our
hell hole before we got there?

1:04:59.199 --> 1:05:02.202
Not very long.
I just straightened up a little.

1:05:02.202 --> 1:05:03.595
Listened to the radio.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:04.770
What radio?

1:05:04.770 --> 1:05:06.728
Oh, the radio.

1:05:06.728 --> 1:05:09.775
What was on the radio?

1:05:09.775 --> 1:05:11.516
Some little radio play.

1:05:11.516 --> 1:05:13.474
More like a soap opera.

1:05:13.474 --> 1:05:17.217
I'm ashamed to admit
I listened to that silly thing.

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:18.697
-What was it about?
-Who cares?

1:05:18.697 --> 1:05:20.307
I want to hear more about the
both of you.

1:05:20.307 --> 1:05:21.830
I'm interested, too.

1:05:21.830 --> 1:05:23.920
Let's see, it was two
characters.

1:05:25.008 --> 1:05:27.445
A Frenchman and a girl.

1:05:27.445 --> 1:05:29.360
In the beginning, he's on his
way home...

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:32.189
...and she's upset about
something.

1:05:32.189 --> 1:05:36.323
It turns out she thinks
he's having an affair.

1:05:36.323 --> 1:05:38.543
And he says, "I didn't, I
didn't!"

1:05:38.543 --> 1:05:40.588
And she says,
"Well, how do you explain
this?"...

1:05:40.588 --> 1:05:43.635
...and shows him some
undergarments
she found in the couch...

1:05:43.635 --> 1:05:46.681
...and some other things he
can't explain,
and he denies it.

1:05:46.681 --> 1:05:49.075
Then she says something about
monkeys.

1:05:49.075 --> 1:05:50.903
I really couldn't follow that.

1:05:50.903 --> 1:05:52.731
And then there was silence for a
bit...

1:05:52.731 --> 1:05:54.428
...and then he confesses.

1:05:54.428 --> 1:05:56.996
He what?

1:05:56.996 --> 1:05:58.215
He confesses.

1:05:58.215 --> 1:05:59.956
He was seeing another woman...

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:02.784
...an investor or something.
It was a little confusing.

1:06:02.784 --> 1:06:04.003
Come on, let's go!

1:06:04.003 --> 1:06:06.049
Then what happened?

1:06:06.049 --> 1:06:08.790
He starts crying and begging her
to forgive him...

1:06:08.790 --> 1:06:10.618
...and she says a certain
four-letter word...

1:06:10.618 --> 1:06:12.577
...more than a couple of times
and storms out.

1:06:12.577 --> 1:06:15.710
I didn't know you were so
interested
in this kind of thing.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:18.148
We listen to that show all the
time.

1:06:19.192 --> 1:06:20.846
Watch your fingers.

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:23.196
I've got it.

1:06:23.196 --> 1:06:24.589
Good.

1:06:24.589 --> 1:06:26.025
Look at him.

1:06:26.025 --> 1:06:27.113
All right.

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:41.388
I can't. I have to go.

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.435
I'm waiting for a call. Shit.

1:06:45.566 --> 1:06:47.481
[WE] Qui est lÃ ?[WE] Who is
it?

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:54.488
Anton? I'm Mr. Green.

1:06:54.488 --> 1:06:56.055
Linda's father.

1:06:56.055 --> 1:06:57.361
How are you? Come on.

1:06:57.361 --> 1:06:59.189
Can I offer you something, a
cup--

1:06:59.189 --> 1:07:02.931
"Anton, you hurt me very badly.

1:07:02.931 --> 1:07:07.066
"All I asked for was honesty,
and you betrayed me.

1:07:07.066 --> 1:07:08.546
"I had hoped...."

1:07:10.069 --> 1:07:11.505
Ah, hell....

1:07:15.596 --> 1:07:17.033
I can't believe it. We did it!

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:18.295
Why?

1:07:19.470 --> 1:07:21.037
We did it, Sam!

1:07:23.256 --> 1:07:26.129
All this time,
and we weren't even here for it.

1:07:32.526 --> 1:07:34.615
What are you going to do now?

1:07:34.615 --> 1:07:37.401
She left suddenly, right?

1:07:37.401 --> 1:07:40.404
So she probably went someplace
familiar.

1:07:40.404 --> 1:07:42.188
To the hotel where she was
staying before.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:47.411
You're probably right.

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.979
What are you waiting for, Sam?

1:07:50.979 --> 1:07:52.546
Go get her.

1:07:52.546 --> 1:07:54.157
Now?

1:07:54.157 --> 1:07:57.073
Yeah, now. What's the matter
with now?

1:07:57.073 --> 1:08:00.467
I can't. What would it look
like?

1:08:00.467 --> 1:08:02.991
Who cares? She's not thinking
straight.

1:08:02.991 --> 1:08:04.645
She'll buy anything.

1:08:04.645 --> 1:08:07.822
What's the big hurry
to get me out of here?

1:08:07.822 --> 1:08:11.304
Look, if you don't want her
after all this....

1:08:11.304 --> 1:08:12.958
Of course I do.

1:08:16.483 --> 1:08:17.571
I don't care about that.

1:08:17.571 --> 1:08:19.486
It's your business.

1:08:19.486 --> 1:08:21.488
I still got some work to do...

1:08:21.488 --> 1:08:24.143
...and, no offense,
but I really miss my privacy.

1:08:25.579 --> 1:08:29.192
I thought we could just take
a minute to say good-bye.

1:08:29.192 --> 1:08:31.629
I mean, it feels kind of strange
to not....

1:08:47.514 --> 1:08:50.343
You have to wreck everything,
don't you?

1:08:50.343 --> 1:08:52.650
Are we done saying good-bye yet?

1:08:55.783 --> 1:08:57.263
You're still here.

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:16.543
No, she does not want to see
you.

1:09:16.543 --> 1:09:18.284
You are not welcome.

1:09:18.284 --> 1:09:21.200
You try and sneak in here again,
and you're going to jail.

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.028
How dare you, you [WE] salopard
[WE]?

1:09:23.028 --> 1:09:24.943
I rape your skull!

1:09:26.945 --> 1:09:28.164
Dishwasher!

1:09:29.730 --> 1:09:31.689
I knew it was you.

1:09:31.689 --> 1:09:33.908
Anton, hi.

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:35.997
Is that any kind of greeting
for your old boss?

1:09:35.997 --> 1:09:37.042
How are you?

1:09:37.042 --> 1:09:38.696
I've never been better.

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:42.743
Every day is a holiday,
every night the Fourth of July.

1:09:42.743 --> 1:09:46.573
Oh, good. Well, I better be
going.

1:09:46.573 --> 1:09:47.748
I'm lying.

1:09:49.054 --> 1:09:50.490
I feel terrible.

1:09:50.490 --> 1:09:52.188
I broke up with my fiancÃ©e.

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:55.016
My restaurant is gone,
and I'm running out of money.

1:09:56.975 --> 1:09:58.063
I'm sorry.

1:09:58.063 --> 1:10:00.065
Don't worry. Don't be sorry.

1:10:00.065 --> 1:10:02.198
Do you have a place yet?

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:03.764
Not yet.

1:10:03.764 --> 1:10:05.766
You'll stay with me, then.

1:10:05.766 --> 1:10:07.812
Why? You don't even know me.

1:10:07.812 --> 1:10:09.292
I know one thing.

1:10:09.292 --> 1:10:10.945
That last night at the
restaurant...

1:10:10.945 --> 1:10:12.643
...everyone is running around,
even me...

1:10:12.643 --> 1:10:14.645
...but I notice you in your
little room.

1:10:14.645 --> 1:10:16.603
You were not looking out...

1:10:16.603 --> 1:10:18.779
...you were not staring
stupidly like the rest.

1:10:18.779 --> 1:10:20.651
You just kept working like a
rock.

1:10:20.651 --> 1:10:23.001
You're a good man, good friend.

1:10:23.001 --> 1:10:25.656
What's your name, by the way?

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:27.875
Mike, I'm a nervous wreck.

1:10:27.875 --> 1:10:29.573
I'm not doing well on my own.

1:10:29.573 --> 1:10:31.096
I feel [WE] vide[WE].

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:33.881
It's like somebody
has thrown away a piece of me.

1:10:33.881 --> 1:10:35.274
How do you say [WE] vide[WE]...

1:10:35.274 --> 1:10:37.581
...when there is nothing inside
something?

1:10:37.581 --> 1:10:38.843
Hollow.

1:10:38.843 --> 1:10:42.455
Yeah. That's how I feel.

1:10:42.455 --> 1:10:45.110
I feel so hollow.

1:10:45.110 --> 1:10:47.373
You would be doing me a favor,
really.

1:10:47.373 --> 1:10:49.506
Just one drink.

1:10:49.506 --> 1:10:52.248
I can't go back to
that empty apartment by myself.

1:10:52.248 --> 1:10:55.425
I will die. Please.

1:10:55.425 --> 1:10:57.818
That's it. No more.

1:10:57.818 --> 1:10:59.690
You must try this one next.

1:10:59.690 --> 1:11:01.953
It's a sexy little Margaux from
'83.

1:11:01.953 --> 1:11:04.172
I was going to give it to
Matheson...

1:11:04.172 --> 1:11:07.175
...to help wash down the bugs.

1:11:07.175 --> 1:11:09.265
Mike, I don't know how she found
out.

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:12.050
I was going to tell this
other woman good-bye, anyway.

1:11:12.050 --> 1:11:14.835
I only slept with her to help
the loan for my restaurant.

1:11:14.835 --> 1:11:16.489
It's not like I cheated, you
know...

1:11:16.489 --> 1:11:18.361
...and it was only once with
this woman.

1:11:18.361 --> 1:11:19.840
And I hardly came at all...

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.366
...just a fraction of what I'm
capable.

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:25.368
I thought of Linda the entire
time.

1:11:25.368 --> 1:11:27.195
If that can be twisted
into something terrible...

1:11:27.195 --> 1:11:30.155
...I'm surely the only sane man
in a world gone mad.

1:11:31.809 --> 1:11:33.245
Don't you think?

1:11:34.377 --> 1:11:36.857
I really couldn't say, Anton.

1:11:39.207 --> 1:11:41.340
I'm going to get her back, Mike.

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:44.865
She needs me.

1:11:44.865 --> 1:11:47.607
I have to get her back.

1:11:47.607 --> 1:11:49.087
This is really good.

1:11:51.219 --> 1:11:53.309
I'm sorry. It is.

1:11:54.353 --> 1:11:56.050
Time for bed.

1:11:56.050 --> 1:11:58.488
I have modeling work
waiting for me tomorrow.

1:11:58.488 --> 1:12:02.492
A step down, yes,
but Anton Depeux isn't proud.

1:12:02.492 --> 1:12:04.450
Look at me, Mike.

1:12:04.450 --> 1:12:08.106
I haven't gained a pound
since my modeling days.

1:12:10.935 --> 1:12:14.721
I'm going to be just fine,
and you don't worry about me.

1:12:14.721 --> 1:12:16.680
I guess I better be moseying on,
then.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:18.508
Let you get your beauty rest.

1:12:19.813 --> 1:12:21.815
Please, a little longer.

1:12:21.815 --> 1:12:23.513
You know,
the [WE]crÃ¨me[WE] caramel is
almost done...

1:12:23.513 --> 1:12:26.080
...and I have a very nice wine
for my friend Pierre.

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:28.996
I'll be right back. Here you
go. Please.

1:12:28.996 --> 1:12:30.302
Wait there.

1:12:40.007 --> 1:12:41.531
Maggie, come to the window.

1:12:41.531 --> 1:12:43.489
Please, this wasn't my idea.

1:12:43.489 --> 1:12:46.449
Maggie, don't be angry with me.

1:12:47.537 --> 1:12:51.105
Maggie, look at him.
How could I leave him?

1:13:01.681 --> 1:13:05.119
I haven't done this in years.

1:13:05.119 --> 1:13:07.121
How is it in English?

1:13:07.121 --> 1:13:09.123
"Our Father, who art in
heaven..."

1:13:09.123 --> 1:13:11.952
"Our Father, who art in
heaven..."
I miss my father.

1:13:11.952 --> 1:13:13.867
"Hallowed be Thy name..."

1:13:13.867 --> 1:13:16.217
"Hollow...hollow..."

1:13:18.437 --> 1:13:20.396
"Hallowed be Thy name...."

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:58.042
Stay out of my business.

1:14:23.763 --> 1:14:26.636
After you, Abner...and Evelyn.

1:14:26.636 --> 1:14:29.377
Marching good. We're being a
snake.

1:14:29.377 --> 1:14:31.641
A snake. We're looking good.

1:14:31.641 --> 1:14:34.078
Now be an elephant.

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:38.691
And marching and two and....

1:14:52.618 --> 1:14:54.098
Oh, my God!

1:14:54.098 --> 1:14:56.753
Sam, it is you.

1:15:01.975 --> 1:15:04.021
You're here because of me?

1:15:11.115 --> 1:15:14.205
God, Sam, I can't believe
you're actually here with me.

1:15:14.205 --> 1:15:16.512
I can't, either.

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:18.383
If only you knew
what I've been going through...

1:15:18.383 --> 1:15:20.037
...the last couple of days.

1:15:20.037 --> 1:15:23.170
Listen to me, feeling sorry for
myself.

1:15:23.170 --> 1:15:24.911
You know what I miss?

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:26.130
I miss noon.

1:15:26.130 --> 1:15:27.523
Me, too.

1:15:27.523 --> 1:15:31.744
Sometimes I look up and wave at
the sky.

1:15:31.744 --> 1:15:34.704
-The kids think I'm nuts.
-I know.

1:15:34.704 --> 1:15:36.270
Of course you do.

1:15:36.270 --> 1:15:39.056
You've been watching me
through your telescope...

1:15:39.056 --> 1:15:40.361
...all the way from Archer's
Bluff.

1:15:40.361 --> 1:15:44.191
Sam, you're the best.

1:15:44.191 --> 1:15:47.412
How could I ever leave you?
What was I thinking?

1:15:47.412 --> 1:15:48.805
Why did you?

1:15:48.805 --> 1:15:50.154
I don't know. I'm nuts.

1:15:50.154 --> 1:15:51.808
That's what my father says.

1:15:51.808 --> 1:15:53.592
That's not a real answer.

1:15:53.592 --> 1:15:54.898
I know.

1:15:59.772 --> 1:16:02.688
Why did I ever leave you, Sam?

1:16:02.688 --> 1:16:06.039
You're so generous and kind and
honest.

1:16:07.388 --> 1:16:11.175
Linda,
you don't know everything about
me.

1:16:11.175 --> 1:16:13.960
Of course I do.

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:15.788
You're my Milky Way man.

1:16:23.927 --> 1:16:25.929
You're in love with that man?

1:16:25.929 --> 1:16:28.453
You're breaking my heart!

1:16:28.453 --> 1:16:30.237
Get him off! Come on!

1:16:34.764 --> 1:16:37.201
Kiss me, Sam, please.

1:16:55.088 --> 1:16:57.003
I got a stud.

1:16:59.136 --> 1:17:00.659
That I didn't know.

1:17:03.793 --> 1:17:06.143
Linda, let's go!

1:17:08.319 --> 1:17:10.364
I got to go.

1:17:10.364 --> 1:17:12.758
Come to my hotel tonight.

1:17:12.758 --> 1:17:15.152
The Evangeline, eight o'clock?

1:17:15.152 --> 1:17:16.370
Eight o'clock. I'll be there.

1:17:16.370 --> 1:17:18.372
Let's give that man a hand.

1:17:18.372 --> 1:17:21.071
Thank you, thank you.

1:17:24.814 --> 1:17:27.991
Go to hell! Take anything you
want.

1:17:27.991 --> 1:17:30.515
Don't forget the TV!

1:17:30.515 --> 1:17:32.735
And don't forget the sofa also!

1:17:32.735 --> 1:17:35.868
[WE] Voleurs! Fascistes![WE]

1:17:35.868 --> 1:17:37.391
How dare you?

1:17:37.391 --> 1:17:40.220
I'll rape your skull, you [WE]
salopard[WE]!

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:42.135
Look out.

1:17:42.135 --> 1:17:43.789
Anton, what's going on?

1:17:43.789 --> 1:17:45.661
Credit card bastards!

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:47.488
They say I owe them thousands.

1:17:47.488 --> 1:17:48.794
I never used the card.

1:17:48.794 --> 1:17:50.753
Help me find my other shoe...

1:17:50.753 --> 1:17:53.059
...because if I find my other
shoe, I will be just fine.

1:17:53.059 --> 1:17:55.409
I have a nice little
modeling job waiting for me...

1:17:55.409 --> 1:17:57.020
...with a nice little agency...

1:17:57.020 --> 1:17:58.761
...and after I get my money,
I'm going to go down...

1:17:58.761 --> 1:18:02.852
...and wipe it in their
disgusting
credit card faces!

1:18:02.852 --> 1:18:04.897
You can't keep Anton Depeux
down...

1:18:04.897 --> 1:18:07.857
...because Anton Depeux
is going to be just fine!

1:18:07.857 --> 1:18:10.250
Look at me now, you credit card
bastards!

1:18:12.905 --> 1:18:15.734
What, a pimple?

1:18:15.734 --> 1:18:18.650
Tell me it's not a pimple.

1:18:18.650 --> 1:18:20.565
Is it a rash or an allergy?

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:24.612
It's called a chronic allergy.

1:18:24.612 --> 1:18:27.790
It's from food or mold,
like shellfish, strawberries--

1:18:27.790 --> 1:18:29.095
Strawberries?

1:18:29.095 --> 1:18:32.446
I haven't touched any of...

1:18:32.446 --> 1:18:36.450
...of those...for years.

1:18:36.450 --> 1:18:39.889
Well, can I get you some ice or
heat?
Ointment?

1:18:41.412 --> 1:18:42.892
Look! Look! Look!

1:18:42.892 --> 1:18:44.763
I am...look....

1:18:49.376 --> 1:18:50.595
There you go.

1:18:53.946 --> 1:18:55.818
There you go, lover.

1:18:57.297 --> 1:18:59.343
That's what I want to hear.

1:19:25.630 --> 1:19:27.240
Hold it! Stop!

1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:31.679
We need to talk.

1:19:31.679 --> 1:19:33.420
So how was your date with Linda?

1:19:33.420 --> 1:19:35.901
You looked cozy. I'm happy it
worked out.

1:19:35.901 --> 1:19:36.902
You were there?

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:38.295
I miss you, Sam.

1:19:38.295 --> 1:19:39.818
We were like girlfriends.

1:19:39.818 --> 1:19:42.038
This isn't about him anymore, is
it?

1:19:42.038 --> 1:19:43.213
Who, him?

1:19:45.955 --> 1:19:47.957
You know, call me a hopeless
romantic.

1:19:47.957 --> 1:19:50.176
I just hate to let him out of my
sight.

1:20:01.448 --> 1:20:02.536
Where are you going?

1:20:02.536 --> 1:20:05.757
Nothing worse can happen to me.

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:07.019
I have to see Linda.

1:20:07.019 --> 1:20:08.194
This is very painful.

1:20:08.194 --> 1:20:09.848
Maybe now isn't a good time.

1:20:09.848 --> 1:20:11.632
You don't look your best.

1:20:11.632 --> 1:20:13.983
What if she's seeing another
man, Mike?

1:20:13.983 --> 1:20:16.768
Another man touching her hair,
her hips...

1:20:16.768 --> 1:20:17.987
...her pink panties.

1:20:17.987 --> 1:20:20.250
Oh, God, her pink panties.

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:22.382
The one with the little....

1:20:22.382 --> 1:20:24.471
You think me pathetic, don't
you?

1:20:24.471 --> 1:20:25.777
Yes, I do.

1:20:28.171 --> 1:20:30.434
With Linda,
the worst moments of my life...

1:20:30.434 --> 1:20:33.306
...were the happiest I've ever
known.

1:20:33.306 --> 1:20:36.527
Even as the world was crashing
around my shoulders...

1:20:36.527 --> 1:20:39.095
...I had the most extraordinary
times with her.

1:20:39.095 --> 1:20:42.707
Yet I only knew her a brief
time.

1:20:42.707 --> 1:20:44.448
Your woman, how long do you know
her?

1:20:44.448 --> 1:20:45.928
A few weeks.

1:20:45.928 --> 1:20:47.407
A few weeks? Love comes swift
and hard.

1:20:47.407 --> 1:20:50.410
Not a few weeks. Since we were
kids.

1:20:50.410 --> 1:20:52.456
You just said a few weeks.

1:20:52.456 --> 1:20:54.632
I did. I said that.

1:20:54.632 --> 1:20:56.199
I didn't say you didn't.

1:20:56.199 --> 1:20:58.636
But I did. I said that.

1:20:58.636 --> 1:21:01.073
How did you two meet?

1:21:01.073 --> 1:21:02.901
Common interests.

1:21:02.901 --> 1:21:04.250
When will I meet her?

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:06.687
We're actually not together
anymore.

1:21:06.687 --> 1:21:07.993
You didn't get along?

1:21:07.993 --> 1:21:09.777
No. We had a great time
together.

1:21:09.777 --> 1:21:11.518
And what drove you apart?

1:21:11.518 --> 1:21:12.955
Another guy.

1:21:12.955 --> 1:21:14.565
She loves another man?

1:21:14.565 --> 1:21:16.915
No, she hates him.

1:21:16.915 --> 1:21:19.048
She hates his guts.

1:21:19.048 --> 1:21:23.443
Anton, I'm sorry. I have to go.

1:21:23.443 --> 1:21:24.836
You're not coming with me to see
her?

1:21:24.836 --> 1:21:26.882
You're on your own, sport.

1:21:42.636 --> 1:21:46.336
What in the world are you doing?
I didn't even come close to him!

1:21:54.692 --> 1:21:56.563
I'm so sorry, Anton.

1:21:58.304 --> 1:21:59.958
I'm so sorry.

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:02.134
Linda. Where is Linda?

1:22:02.134 --> 1:22:03.309
It's all right. I'm here.

1:22:03.309 --> 1:22:06.486
Linda Green!

1:22:38.649 --> 1:22:39.650
Nice and slow.

1:22:39.650 --> 1:22:42.174
I got you.

1:22:42.174 --> 1:22:43.132
Go back.

1:23:13.771 --> 1:23:15.642
I almost killed him, Maggie.

1:23:15.642 --> 1:23:17.296
I was trying to protect him
from somebody...

1:23:17.296 --> 1:23:19.733
...who I thought was you,
and I almost killed him.

1:23:19.733 --> 1:23:21.909
I broke his arms and his ribs.

1:23:21.909 --> 1:23:23.172
For what?

1:23:24.695 --> 1:23:26.305
I was going to ask you about
that, Sam.

1:23:26.305 --> 1:23:28.177
Not that I'm ungrateful.

1:23:28.177 --> 1:23:29.569
Stop it, Maggie. Just stop it.

1:23:29.569 --> 1:23:31.180
I was just curious about that.

1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:33.399
This isn't about him anymore.
This is about us.

1:23:33.399 --> 1:23:35.532
You and me.

1:23:35.532 --> 1:23:37.012
I love you, Maggie.

1:23:38.448 --> 1:23:39.840
Oh, God, don't do this.

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:41.451
I love you.

1:23:41.451 --> 1:23:43.583
-What are you doing?
-And I know you love me.

1:23:43.583 --> 1:23:45.281
Why are you saying that?

1:23:45.281 --> 1:23:47.587
-I know you love me.
-Don't do this, Sam.

1:23:47.587 --> 1:23:49.198
You're crazy about me.

1:23:49.198 --> 1:23:51.243
You should go home.
Just get on a plane and go.

1:23:51.243 --> 1:23:53.941
I won't hurt you, Maggie, I
swear.

1:23:53.941 --> 1:23:56.596
Look, I am trying to be nice,
and you....

1:23:59.599 --> 1:24:01.601
I don't love you, Sam.

1:24:01.601 --> 1:24:04.822
I don't have one iota of feeling
for you whatsoever.

1:24:04.822 --> 1:24:08.043
Then what were you doing this
morning
watching me and Linda?

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:09.348
He wasn't there.

1:24:09.348 --> 1:24:11.046
Why were you there?

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:13.178
It's none of your business
anymore what I do or why.

1:24:13.178 --> 1:24:15.920
You were there watching me...

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:19.402
...because you care about me,
because you have feelings for
me.

1:24:22.057 --> 1:24:25.669
You want to know why I was
there, Sam?
You really want to know?

1:24:25.669 --> 1:24:27.453
Pictures.

1:24:27.453 --> 1:24:30.239
Pictures of you and Linda.

1:24:30.239 --> 1:24:32.415
I told you I want him finished
off.

1:24:32.415 --> 1:24:34.460
It doesn't have anything to do
with you and me.

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:36.593
I told you, stay out of my way.

1:24:40.031 --> 1:24:41.728
That's it?

1:24:41.728 --> 1:24:43.948
If that's what you want,
that's what it's going to take.

1:24:43.948 --> 1:24:47.038
Fine. Let's get it the hell
over with, then.

1:25:09.495 --> 1:25:11.976
Thank God, Mike. Thank God
you're back.

1:25:11.976 --> 1:25:13.586
Scratch me, Mike, please.

1:25:13.586 --> 1:25:15.806
Scratch my chest, my face,
quickly.

1:25:15.806 --> 1:25:17.460
Why?

1:25:17.460 --> 1:25:19.810
Please, I'm not kidding. I
can't stand it.

1:25:19.810 --> 1:25:21.507
Why should I help you?

1:25:21.507 --> 1:25:23.640
For the love of God, Mike!

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.424
What did you do, Anton?

1:25:25.424 --> 1:25:28.688
You must've done something
terrible to deserve all this.

1:25:28.688 --> 1:25:30.299
What did you do?

1:25:30.299 --> 1:25:32.605
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1:25:32.605 --> 1:25:34.520
Confess, Anton!

1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:36.435
Have you gone mad?

1:25:36.435 --> 1:25:38.002
I'm begging you.

1:25:38.002 --> 1:25:40.309
Just for a moment.

1:25:40.309 --> 1:25:42.049
Just one scratch.

1:25:42.049 --> 1:25:44.400
Look at you.
You've lost everything you have.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:47.533
Your money, your love, your
self-respect.

1:25:47.533 --> 1:25:49.056
You're broken, Anton.

1:25:49.056 --> 1:25:50.493
You're repulsive!

1:25:51.885 --> 1:25:54.453
Is this what you want? Is this
enough?

1:25:54.453 --> 1:25:56.760
No, huh? You want more?

1:25:58.283 --> 1:25:59.502
All right.

1:26:01.330 --> 1:26:04.463
Do it, Anton. Confess.

1:26:04.463 --> 1:26:06.726
Confess what?

1:26:06.726 --> 1:26:07.988
That you hurt people!

1:26:07.988 --> 1:26:10.600
Who, Linda? Yes, I cheated on
Linda.

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.386
I admit it, but why should you
care?

1:26:14.386 --> 1:26:15.822
You were using her, weren't you?

1:26:15.822 --> 1:26:17.781
What are you talking about?

1:26:17.781 --> 1:26:19.609
Just admit it!

1:26:19.609 --> 1:26:21.567
That you were using her
to stay in this country...

1:26:21.567 --> 1:26:23.874
...just the way you used Maggie!

1:26:38.845 --> 1:26:41.544
I never told you anything about
Maggie.

1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:45.765
Who the hell are you?

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:49.378
I'm the Milky Way man...

1:26:49.378 --> 1:26:52.294
...and I know everything.

1:26:59.126 --> 1:27:01.259
You're going to hurt yourself.

1:27:06.917 --> 1:27:08.092
You're killing yourself.

1:27:08.092 --> 1:27:09.354
Here. Let me help you.

1:27:19.582 --> 1:27:22.802
How's this? You enjoying the
show?

1:28:31.436 --> 1:28:33.308
Maggie was my angel.

1:28:37.007 --> 1:28:40.489
She brought me here, in America.

1:28:40.489 --> 1:28:42.839
I was nothing before I met her.

1:28:42.839 --> 1:28:46.277
Just a waiter in a little cafÃ©
in Paris.

1:28:49.846 --> 1:28:52.370
Yeah. I used her.

1:28:53.545 --> 1:28:55.373
I used her terribly.

1:28:56.548 --> 1:28:58.942
But I didn't think it
mattered...

1:29:00.117 --> 1:29:01.901
...because I was...

1:29:01.901 --> 1:29:05.209
...sure that I would grow to
love her.

1:29:08.081 --> 1:29:10.954
I thought if I could just love
her, then...

1:29:13.043 --> 1:29:15.045
...it would be all right.

1:29:17.917 --> 1:29:19.789
The shame would go away.

1:29:21.399 --> 1:29:23.967
You can't choose who you love,
Mike...

1:29:23.967 --> 1:29:26.578
...or whoever the hell you
are...

1:29:26.578 --> 1:29:28.624
...and I love Linda.

1:29:28.624 --> 1:29:30.234
I love Linda.

1:29:36.196 --> 1:29:37.981
More than anything!

1:29:47.991 --> 1:29:52.125
Who the hell do you think
you are to judge?

1:29:52.125 --> 1:29:54.563
Who the hell do you think you
are?

1:29:56.521 --> 1:29:58.088
I'm nobody, Anton.

1:30:01.439 --> 1:30:02.614
I'm nobody.

1:30:05.574 --> 1:30:08.098
Nobody to nobody.

1:30:44.482 --> 1:30:46.441
Linda, we need to talk.

1:30:56.189 --> 1:30:58.627
Hello? Yes, please.

1:30:58.627 --> 1:31:03.980
I need to be scratched on my
face,
my chest, and my back.

1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:05.547
Please. Hello?

1:31:08.245 --> 1:31:11.640
It is an emergency call. I
swear.

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:13.511
Hello, mister?

1:31:59.078 --> 1:32:00.645
Say we're even.

1:32:00.645 --> 1:32:02.429
-What?
-Just say it.

1:32:05.302 --> 1:32:07.260
Yes, we are even.

1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:08.392
Good.

1:32:12.570 --> 1:32:14.180
So how ya been?

1:32:55.308 --> 1:32:58.311
Here! I'm here, Linda!

1:32:58.311 --> 1:33:00.357
Oh, baby! Look at you!

1:33:01.837 --> 1:33:03.534
Oh, God!

1:33:03.534 --> 1:33:06.450
Oh, honey!

1:33:06.450 --> 1:33:09.148
I love you.

1:33:09.148 --> 1:33:11.194
Everything's going to be okay.

1:34:18.783 --> 1:34:20.742
Bad dog! Go away!

1:35:27.809 --> 1:35:30.376
So I saw this episode of [WE]
Lassie[WE] today...

1:35:31.769 --> 1:35:35.251
...and Lassie was accused
of a crime she didn't commit...

1:35:36.905 --> 1:35:40.082
...and the ranger was coming
to put her to sleep.

1:35:42.084 --> 1:35:45.130
How's Lassie going to get out of
this one?

1:35:45.130 --> 1:35:49.787
Well, the little boy found out
that the ranger was coming...

1:35:49.787 --> 1:35:52.703
...and he told Lassie that...

1:35:52.703 --> 1:35:55.140
...that she had to go away, far
away.

1:35:55.140 --> 1:35:56.576
For her own good.

1:35:56.576 --> 1:35:59.841
But Lassie wouldn't leave.

1:35:59.841 --> 1:36:02.495
See, Lassie just couldn't leave
the boy.

1:36:04.628 --> 1:36:06.108
What did he do?

1:36:07.805 --> 1:36:09.764
He told her that he never liked
her.

1:36:09.764 --> 1:36:13.506
He said, "I hate you.

1:36:13.506 --> 1:36:16.509
"I hate you, Lassie. You're a
bad dog.

1:36:16.509 --> 1:36:18.511
"I hope I never see you again."

1:36:18.511 --> 1:36:21.123
That must have made Lassie sad.

1:36:21.123 --> 1:36:22.124
Yes, it did.

1:36:22.124 --> 1:36:24.517
Lassie trotted off...

1:36:24.517 --> 1:36:25.954
...very sadly.

1:36:28.347 --> 1:36:30.262
But you know what happened?

1:36:32.264 --> 1:36:34.571
Lassie came home, Maggie.

1:36:34.571 --> 1:36:37.269
Did the little boy make it with
Lassie?

1:36:40.664 --> 1:36:42.100
Yes, he did.

1:37:06.429 --> 1:37:08.648
