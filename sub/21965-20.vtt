00:03.875 --> 00:06.375
BOULDER:

00:03.875 --> 00:06.375
Welcome to your new home, Leafy.

00:06.417 --> 00:10.625
Now you'll have room to stretch

00:06.417 --> 00:10.625
your roots and grow up tall.

00:10.667 --> 00:13.041
Do you think he'll be lonely

00:10.667 --> 00:13.041
out here on his own?

00:13.083 --> 00:15.333
We can come back

00:13.083 --> 00:15.333
and visit any time, Boulder.

00:15.375 --> 00:18.333
Plus, after today,

00:15.375 --> 00:18.333
Leafy will have lots of friends.

00:18.375 --> 00:23.542
Griffin Rock's Plant a Tree Day

00:18.375 --> 00:23.542
promises to be better than ever.

00:23.583 --> 00:25.750
Because this year he won't give

00:23.583 --> 00:25.750
a three hour speech?

00:25.792 --> 00:28.625
Yeah.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.625
Thanks to my tireless efforts,

00:28.667 --> 00:34.083
and, uh, your taxes, may I

00:28.667 --> 00:34.083
present our town's newest tech--

00:34.125 --> 00:36.625
The Power Planter!

00:36.667 --> 00:39.959
With this machine to do

00:36.667 --> 00:39.959
the dirty work, we can keep

00:40.000 --> 00:44.250
our hands clean for more

00:40.000 --> 00:44.250
important things. Ha, ha.

00:44.291 --> 00:47.959
What's not important

00:44.291 --> 00:47.959
about spending time with nature?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.875
( beeps )

00:49.917 --> 00:51.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

01:04.125 --> 01:06.000
( crowd murmurs )

01:06.041 --> 01:08.917
Wow. It would take us hours

01:06.041 --> 01:08.917
to do all that planting.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.291
Pretty noble,

01:08.959 --> 01:11.291
right, Boulder?

01:11.333 --> 01:12.709
I guess.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.750
But how do those trees

01:12.750 --> 01:14.750
know they're loved

01:14.792 --> 01:16.041
if they're never touched?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.875
Or talked to?

01:17.917 --> 01:20.792
It takes a living thing to care

01:17.917 --> 01:20.792
for other living things.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.917
(  upbeat theme playing  )

01:23.959 --> 01:29.041
Today on  I Dare Me,  I'm here

01:23.959 --> 01:29.041
with the new Power Planter.

01:29.083 --> 01:33.583
My notes say it's programmed

01:29.083 --> 01:33.583
to avoid all heat sources.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.291
Let's find out.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

01:48.291 --> 01:52.083
There you have it, folks.

01:48.291 --> 01:52.083
100% safe.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.083
And a very short episode.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.041
( thunder crashing )

01:56.083 --> 01:59.625
Mr. Mayor, can we wrap this up?

01:56.083 --> 01:59.625
Looks like a storm's on the way.

01:59.667 --> 02:03.458
Oh, relax, Chief.

01:59.667 --> 02:03.458
Trees love rain.

Ugh. Turn off!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.959
Off! Ah!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.834
Does this thing need

03:20.000 --> 03:21.834
new batteries already?

03:33.250 --> 03:36.792
Unh. Get to safety, Mr. Mayor.

03:33.250 --> 03:36.792
We'll handle this.

03:36.834 --> 03:40.583
Uh, well, if you're sure

03:36.834 --> 03:40.583
you don't need me, Chief.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.792
Dani, Kade, clear the area.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.750
Graham, see if you can manually

03:42.834 --> 03:45.750
shut off that Planter.

( gasps )

( grunts )

03:54.208 --> 03:57.083
I need backup!

Hey, crab-hands! Plant this!

03:57.125 --> 03:58.375
( grunts )

04:01.458 --> 04:02.875
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

04:11.709 --> 04:13.959
Leafy!

04:21.709 --> 04:23.875
Maybe you're not ready

04:21.709 --> 04:23.875
for the outdoors yet.

04:23.917 --> 04:26.291
It's dangerous out here.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.375
I see what caused the Power

04:28.125 --> 04:31.375
Planter's strange behavior.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.041
If the lightning had struck

04:31.417 --> 04:33.041
anywhere else,

04:33.083 --> 04:34.834
it would have simply

04:33.083 --> 04:34.834
shut off the machine.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.500
But the blast hit here,

04:36.542 --> 04:38.959
compromising the Planter's

04:36.542 --> 04:38.959
Central Processing Unit.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.542
And that is...?

04:41.583 --> 04:42.834
The system's Achilles' Heel.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.875
Which actually

04:42.875 --> 04:44.875
means less to me.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.166
That's a bad thing.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.000
So with its programming

04:47.208 --> 04:49.000
scrambled,

04:49.041 --> 04:51.041
maybe the Planter

04:49.041 --> 04:51.041
will just stay underground.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.542
There's a high probability.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.834
And that's a good thing.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.834
( groans )

04:55.875 --> 04:58.750
We'll keep a close eye on

04:55.875 --> 04:58.750
the park for the next few days.

04:58.792 --> 05:02.125
With any luck, we've seen

04:58.792 --> 05:02.125
the last of that Power Planter.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.166
(  upbeat theme playing  )

05:11.458 --> 05:17.083
Ah, finally, a well-earned break

05:11.458 --> 05:17.083
from the demands of office.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.792
( coos )

05:23.417 --> 05:28.875
Give that back!

05:23.417 --> 05:28.875
This hair is spoken for!

( screams )

05:33.792 --> 05:35.625
CHIEF:

05:33.792 --> 05:35.625
Slow down, Mayor Luskey.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.667
Your backyard is being overrun

05:35.667 --> 05:39.667
by what kind of animals?

05:39.709 --> 05:41.875
Uh, maybe those kind?

05:41.917 --> 05:45.583
If that's a migration pattern,

05:41.917 --> 05:45.583
it sure is a strange one.

05:45.625 --> 05:49.000
Especially since those animals

05:45.625 --> 05:49.000
don't normally migrate.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.125
Hang tight, Mayor.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.125
I've got another call coming in.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.333
Badgers eating

05:51.166 --> 05:54.333
your fruit stand?

05:54.375 --> 05:56.875
We'll--We'll see to it.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.875
Hold, please.

05:56.917 --> 05:59.542
Groundhogs and porcupines?

05:59.583 --> 06:01.291
Better get to your Bots, team.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.834
Apparently, Noah's Ark

just docked in Griffin Rock.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.709
(  upbeat theme playing  )

06:19.208 --> 06:22.792
Does his alarmed response mean

06:19.208 --> 06:22.792
six more weeks of winter, sir?

06:22.834 --> 06:26.583
I believe the groundhogs have

06:22.834 --> 06:26.583
to see their own shadow, Chase.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.166
Let's round them up.

that game at the arcade.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.458
I assure you, sir, I am deriving

06:43.333 --> 06:46.458
no amusement from this.

06:48.834 --> 06:50.458
( chuckles )

06:50.500 --> 06:52.166
Perhaps a little.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

06:57.583 --> 07:00.375
Where'd you say

06:57.583 --> 07:00.375
the porcupine was, Cody?

07:00.417 --> 07:02.792
( children screaming )

07:02.834 --> 07:04.041
Never mind.

handle this one, bud.

07:09.417 --> 07:10.875
My pleasure.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.375
Aw, it likes me.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.959
Sure.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.959
That's what that is.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.792
So, what are we looking

07:17.000 --> 07:20.792
for again? Badgers?

07:20.834 --> 07:24.041
We don't need

07:20.834 --> 07:24.041
no stinkin' badgers.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.208
( badgers squeaking )

07:28.000 --> 07:30.834
( both gasp )

07:30.875 --> 07:33.583
Uhh. Oh, so you want

07:30.875 --> 07:33.583
to play dirty, huh?

07:33.625 --> 07:36.208

Hold on, I'll get you out.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.959
You might want

07:48.041 --> 07:49.959
to hold your nose.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.542
KADE:

07:50.000 --> 07:51.542
Why?

07:51.583 --> 07:53.500
( Kade screams )

07:53.542 --> 07:54.792
( sputters )

07:54.834 --> 07:57.208
Thanks, partner.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.625
At least now you're clean.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.834
BLADES:

08:00.667 --> 08:03.834
I still don't understand.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.875
Isn't sitting in boiling water

08:05.917 --> 08:08.291
sort of like making soup

08:05.917 --> 08:08.291
out of yourself?

08:08.333 --> 08:10.000
It's called a hot tub, Blades.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.458
And if you don't get that,

08:11.500 --> 08:13.959
please don't ask me

08:11.500 --> 08:13.959
to explain saunas.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.417
Okay, Cody. The Mayor's yard

08:14.000 --> 08:16.417
is clear of critters.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.959
What's next?

08:16.458 --> 08:19.959
Let's see.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.041
Whoa. Hold on.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.083
(  suspenseful theme playing )

08:32.667 --> 08:35.166
Uh, I could use some help here.

08:35.208 --> 08:38.333
BLADES:

08:35.208 --> 08:38.333
That is the scariest thing

08:35.208 --> 08:38.333
I've ever seen.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.458
And I know scary.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.750
CODY:

08:40.500 --> 08:43.750
Not sure how long I can keep

08:40.500 --> 08:43.750
them out, guys. Can you hurry?

08:43.792 --> 08:46.083
We're on it, Cody.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.083
Blades, fly close.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.959
Your downdraft should

08:46.125 --> 08:47.959
shoo those bugs away.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.750
How close is close?

08:49.792 --> 08:52.917
All those twitchy

08:49.792 --> 08:52.917
legs and feet--creepy.

08:52.959 --> 08:56.166
They'll be a lot creepier if

08:52.959 --> 08:56.166
they get inside the Firehouse.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.333
When you're right,

08:56.208 --> 08:58.333
you're right.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.291
All clear, Cody.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.291
Those bugs will probably be

09:05.333 --> 09:07.125
a lot happier

09:05.333 --> 09:07.125
on the ground anyhow.

09:07.166 --> 09:10.083
But why did they leave it

09:07.166 --> 09:10.083
in the first place?

09:11.792 --> 09:13.542
CHIEF:

09:11.792 --> 09:13.542
Thanks, Virginia.

09:13.583 --> 09:17.083
The zookeeper's releasing

09:13.583 --> 09:17.083
the animals back into the wild.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.083
Hopefully this time,

09:17.125 --> 09:19.083
they'll stay there.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.709
Porcupines, ants,

09:19.125 --> 09:22.709
groundhogs, badgers...

09:22.750 --> 09:24.583
They have to have

09:22.750 --> 09:24.583
something in common.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.667
Yeah.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.667
They all ruined my day.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.417
Well, each of the species

09:26.709 --> 09:28.417
can live

09:28.458 --> 09:30.125
in underground

09:28.458 --> 09:30.125
burrows and nests.

09:30.166 --> 09:33.041
Underground? That's where

09:30.166 --> 09:33.041
the Power Planter went.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.792
You think it scared

09:33.083 --> 09:35.792
the animals out of their homes?

09:35.834 --> 09:37.875
How? By planting trees

09:35.834 --> 09:37.875
in them?

09:37.917 --> 09:39.542
With the machine's

09:37.917 --> 09:39.542
programming fried,

09:39.583 --> 09:42.125
its behavior

09:39.583 --> 09:42.125
is totally unpredictable.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.375
We need to find that Planter,

09:43.417 --> 09:45.166
before it does something

09:43.417 --> 09:45.166
dangerous.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.083
(  peaceful theme playing  )

09:47.125 --> 09:51.375
Finally, a chance to enjoy

09:47.125 --> 09:51.375
my hot tub in peace.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.667
Oh! It's cold!

09:53.709 --> 09:55.083
( shivers )

09:55.125 --> 09:56.375
My water heater!

09:58.000 --> 10:00.792
But how...

10:00.834 --> 10:02.917
Eh?

10:02.959 --> 10:05.041
That's strange.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.709
( screaming )

10:09.291 --> 10:12.417
( screaming )

10:14.125 --> 10:16.417
( grunting )

10:19.750 --> 10:23.166
Chief Burns! I need you

10:19.750 --> 10:23.166
at my house immediately.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.667
It's an emergency!

10:24.709 --> 10:26.375
Mr. Mayor,

10:24.709 --> 10:26.375
I know that badgers

10:26.417 --> 10:28.375
in your backyard

10:26.417 --> 10:28.375
are a nuisance, but--

10:28.417 --> 10:31.875
MAYOR:

10:28.417 --> 10:31.875
Don't let this overgrown

10:28.417 --> 10:31.875
garden tool eat me!

10:31.917 --> 10:36.041
I think we found

10:31.917 --> 10:36.041
the Power Planter. Let's move.

10:36.083 --> 10:41.792
Stop! Please! I've always

10:36.083 --> 10:41.792
been nice to lawn mowers!

10:41.834 --> 10:43.250
DANI ( over PA ):

10:41.834 --> 10:43.250
Stay calm, Mr. Mayor.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:47.750 --> 10:51.667
BLADES:

10:47.750 --> 10:51.667
Power up and Energize!

10:51.709 --> 10:53.333
( grunts )

11:00.917 --> 11:03.208
Whoa!

11:03.250 --> 11:05.917
Ha! We got them now, Blades!

11:05.959 --> 11:08.458
(  surf rock theme playing  )

11:09.875 --> 11:11.250
Whoa! Whoa!

11:11.291 --> 11:13.959
Whoa-ho! Whoa!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.166
Ay!

11:16.208 --> 11:18.667
Dani! We're going to crash!

11:18.709 --> 11:20.166
Let go!

11:20.208 --> 11:21.583
( screams )

11:24.875 --> 11:27.625
( sirens blaring )

11:27.667 --> 11:31.583
( mayor groaning )

11:31.625 --> 11:34.250
Don't worry, Mr. Mayor, that

11:31.625 --> 11:34.250
planter doesn't stand a chance.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.208
Uh... Where is it?

11:36.250 --> 11:38.333
Ugh. Underground again.

11:38.375 --> 11:41.458
Then can somebody get me down?

11:46.375 --> 11:48.041
Careful!

11:46.375 --> 11:48.041
Relax, Mr. Mayor,

11:48.083 --> 11:51.000
we've had plenty of practice

11:48.083 --> 11:51.000
with Mr. Pettypaws.

11:51.041 --> 11:54.959
And I thought hot tubs

11:51.041 --> 11:54.959
were supposed to be relaxing.

11:58.208 --> 12:01.250
Looks like the insides of the

11:58.208 --> 12:01.250
Mayor's water heater are gone.

12:01.291 --> 12:05.583
A violation of code 651A, in an

12:01.291 --> 12:05.583
elected official's own backyard.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.166
Just when you think

12:05.625 --> 12:08.166
you have seen everything.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.166
From the pincer marks

12:08.208 --> 12:10.166
on this metal,

12:10.208 --> 12:12.667
I'd say the Power Planter

12:10.208 --> 12:12.667
is our thief.

12:12.709 --> 12:15.959
Hmm, strange that the Planter

12:12.709 --> 12:15.959
would be drawn to a heat source.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.792
CODY ( over radio ):

12:16.000 --> 12:17.792
Or maybe not strange at all.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.500
CHIEF:

12:17.834 --> 12:19.500
What makes you say that, Cody?

12:19.542 --> 12:21.166
There's a pattern.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.792
So far, we've seen

12:21.208 --> 12:23.792
the Power Planter tear up trees

12:23.834 --> 12:25.417
instead of planting them.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.667
Now it's going after

12:25.458 --> 12:27.667
heat sources,

12:27.709 --> 12:29.375
instead of away from them.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.792
It's doing the opposite

12:29.417 --> 12:31.792
of what it's supposed to.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.333
The lightning must have reversed

12:31.834 --> 12:35.333
the machine's programming.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.875
This is great!

12:36.917 --> 12:39.208
If we know the Planter

12:36.917 --> 12:39.208
is after heat sources,

12:39.250 --> 12:40.917
we can set a trap

12:39.250 --> 12:40.917
to catch it.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.834
But the island's

12:40.959 --> 12:42.834
full of hot spots.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.625
We're heat sources.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.709
Yeah, for all we know, the

12:44.667 --> 12:47.709
Planter's beneath us right now.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.542
( whimpers )

12:49.583 --> 12:52.500
Wouldn't Boulder be able

12:49.583 --> 12:52.500
to detect that with his sonar?

12:52.542 --> 12:54.667
It doesn't work well

12:52.542 --> 12:54.667
on moving objects.

12:54.709 --> 12:57.667
But we could measure ground

12:54.709 --> 12:57.667
vibrations with a seismograph.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.166
That's a...

12:59.208 --> 13:03.250
I know what

12:59.208 --> 13:03.250
a seismograph is. Sort of.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.959
Cody, pull up a map

13:03.291 --> 13:04.959
of the warmest locations

13:05.000 --> 13:06.542
on Griffin Rock.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.709
The Power Planter's bound

13:06.583 --> 13:08.709
to show up at one of them.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.750
We'll split up

13:08.750 --> 13:10.750
and keep watch.

13:10.792 --> 13:14.083
(  country theme playing  )

13:14.125 --> 13:16.000
I can feel the heat

13:14.125 --> 13:16.000
from over here.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.959
And if I can feel it,

13:16.041 --> 13:17.959
the Planter can feel it,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.542
and if the Planter

13:18.000 --> 13:19.542
can feel it--

13:19.583 --> 13:21.792
Just watch your seismograph,

13:19.583 --> 13:21.792
Blades.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.500
( beeping )

13:25.542 --> 13:29.083
I think I got something.

13:25.542 --> 13:29.083
I got something!

13:29.125 --> 13:31.417
What is it?

13:31.458 --> 13:34.291
BLADES ( over radio ):

13:31.458 --> 13:34.291
It's huge!

13:31.458 --> 13:34.291
Oh, no, it's multiplied!

13:34.333 --> 13:37.000
Wait. Those might be cows.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.458
(  cows mooing  )

13:38.500 --> 13:42.458
Yep. It's cows.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.750
Yep, this is definitely where

13:42.500 --> 13:45.750
the Planter's going to show up.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.041
How can you be so sure?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.875
It's looking for heat, right?

13:48.917 --> 13:52.083
Well, the hottest thing

13:48.917 --> 13:52.083
on the island is right here.

just popped up.

got me trapped in a tunnel!

What?

Where are you now?

17:34.250 --> 17:36.917
According to my readings, Cody

17:34.250 --> 17:36.917
should be right underneath us.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.709
Boulder, smash in

17:36.959 --> 17:38.709
and grab him.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.291
Not yet.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.834
But the seismograph says--

17:42.875 --> 17:44.417
Patience.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.875
It takes a living thing

17:44.458 --> 17:46.875
to take care of a living thing.

Look, buddy,

I trust your instincts, but--

17:49.000 --> 17:50.792
Now!

17:57.000 --> 17:59.542
( sighs ):

17:57.000 --> 17:59.542
Thanks, Boulder.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.000
Ha, ha. I'll never

doubt you again.

Rolling Thunder, Dad.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.917
A Go-Kart we can fix.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.625
I'm done taking risks.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.750
Time to bring the heat

to the Planter.

Why do I need a Boil Coil?

I'm just air support.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.875
The more heat we have

18:32.083 --> 18:33.875
in one spot,

the faster we'll get

You say that

like it's a good thing.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.125
Yes, Mr. Mayor, your hot tub

18:38.583 --> 18:42.125
will have to stay cold for now.

Well, more warm

18:57.834 --> 19:00.333
than fuzzy.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.083
This must be what Chief means

19:00.375 --> 19:03.083
when he complains of--

19:03.125 --> 19:04.917
unh--heartburn.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.375
The Planter better show up fast.

19:04.959 --> 19:08.375
Even I'm getting hot here.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.917
Dad, I'm getting a reading.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.834
All right team.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.834
We're a go.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.375
Burnses, get to cover.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.166
Bots, be on the ready.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.917
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:21.750 --> 19:24.458
Either that's a really

19:21.750 --> 19:24.458
big gopher or...

19:24.500 --> 19:26.542
Rescue Bots, initiate phase one.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.792
HEATWAVE:

19:26.583 --> 19:28.792
Let's uproot this Planter.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.208
( screams )

19:40.125 --> 19:43.250
V-formation,

19:40.125 --> 19:43.250
vehicle mode.

19:43.291 --> 19:46.417
Rescue Bots,

19:43.291 --> 19:46.417
roll to the rescue!

19:51.333 --> 19:52.917
Ready for phase two, guys.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.709
Chase and Boulder,

19:52.959 --> 19:54.709
fall back.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.709
We're turning off

19:54.750 --> 19:57.709
your coils now.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.959
Finish him off, Heatwave.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.750
Bring that scoundrel

20:07.000 --> 20:08.750
to justice.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.583
With pleasure.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:13.458 --> 20:15.000
( grunts )

20:18.291 --> 20:20.083
( grunts )

20:24.333 --> 20:25.583
HEATWAVE:

20:24.333 --> 20:25.583
Ha.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.166
Looks like it takes

20:25.625 --> 20:27.166
a living thing

20:27.208 --> 20:29.709
to take care of

20:27.208 --> 20:29.709
malfunctioning tech, too.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.208
There.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.208
That should keep you safe.

20:37.250 --> 20:40.125
Guess the Power Planter is good

20:37.250 --> 20:40.125
for something after all.

20:40.166 --> 20:44.458
Remember, Leafy. This isn't

20:40.166 --> 20:44.458
goodbye. It's "see you later."

20:44.500 --> 20:47.542
( grunts ):

20:44.500 --> 20:47.542
There, that should do it.

20:47.583 --> 20:50.834
Thanks, Dad. I bet now Rolling

20:47.583 --> 20:50.834
Thunder's faster than ever.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.083
Something I can help you with,

20:50.875 --> 20:53.083
Mr. Mayor?

20:53.125 --> 20:56.583
Uh, yes. I-I was wondering

20:53.125 --> 20:56.583
if it's all right

20:56.625 --> 20:59.250
for me to use my hot tub yet.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.667
I'd prefer to have my team

20:59.291 --> 21:02.667
of experts check it out first.

21:02.709 --> 21:05.125
Just to make sure

21:02.709 --> 21:05.125
everything's safe.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.208
Of course, of course. Heh.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.750
Who turned on the bubbles?

21:09.083 --> 21:10.750
Move over, Kade!

21:10.792 --> 21:12.959
We have to get one of these.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.959
Marco.

21:13.041 --> 21:16.208
Next time, I'm getting

21:13.041 --> 21:16.208
an indoor spa.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.542
( cooing )

21:18.583 --> 21:21.667
No. No. Stay back!

21:21.709 --> 21:23.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

21:25.000 --> 21:26.500
( cooing )

21:26.542 --> 21:28.208
Ah! Come here!

21:28.250 --> 21:29.917
(  upbeat theme playing  )

21:31.959 --> 21:34.166
