WEBVTT

00:09.367 --> 00:12.600
And I know that your lead exec,
Jason Turner just got fired,

00:12.600 --> 00:14.000
but that doesn't mean
that the project is dead.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.367
Aw, oh, thanks.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.500
No, it just means
it's on life support.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.033
Right, um...

00:20.033 --> 00:21.600
Usually how this works is if

00:21.600 --> 00:23.100
you have a headshot in your car
or something,

00:23.100 --> 00:24.167
I'll take it and give it
to my casting people.

00:24.167 --> 00:26.233
But, if you could just
show me to my table.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.000
Oh, of course.
But I'd appreciate the...

00:28.000 --> 00:29.267
Right away, sir.

00:29.267 --> 00:30.567
...you know,
positive feedback.

00:30.567 --> 00:31.633
Follow me.

00:31.633 --> 00:35.300
**

00:37.867 --> 00:39.967
I'm not even hungry.

00:39.967 --> 00:41.100
What am I supposed to do?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.467
My show is on
life support.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.767
Wait, you heard
it's on life support?

00:44.767 --> 00:46.867
That's great news.
I heard it
from the MaÃ®tre D'.

00:46.867 --> 00:48.000
Don't take it
as the gospel.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.567
Yeah, but they're
very plugged in.

00:49.567 --> 00:51.233
Yeah, apparently,
more plugged in than you are.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.900
Hey, I have a meeting
with Rachel today.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.100
She didn't get the ax.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.333
So, we'll see where
we stand with her new boss.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.833
How does your sister
do this to me?

00:57.833 --> 01:01.133
How does having sex with both
my TV executives help me?

01:01.133 --> 01:03.167
Well, Pfeiffer's actually
very good at sex.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.467
So, I'm honestly
surprised it didn't work.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.933
Sorry.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.067
Hey, Coco and Baxter Levy, huh?

01:09.067 --> 01:10.233
What now?
I haven't heard.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.367
Showing up
at every bar,

01:11.367 --> 01:12.467
club and underground party.

01:12.467 --> 01:14.667
(sighs)
Oh, and apparently,

01:14.667 --> 01:17.967
they were caught having sex
in a booth at Norms.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.700
Norms?

01:19.700 --> 01:21.367
The one on Venice Boulevard
or the one on La Cienega?

01:21.367 --> 01:23.567
Sorry?
Ah, it doesn't matter.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.667
I don't go there anymore.
Those two are out of control.

01:25.667 --> 01:28.267
Baxter Levy, what a frickin'
moron that guy is.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.167
And Coco, of all people.

01:30.167 --> 01:31.100
I thought her and I
were on the same page!

01:31.100 --> 01:32.233
You were at the meeting.

01:32.233 --> 01:33.667
You know what?
It's gonna be okay.

01:33.667 --> 01:36.200
George, just go relax
and have fun in Costa Rica.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.333
I'm not going to Costa Rica.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.633
What?
Why?
Because Lori and I

01:39.633 --> 01:40.867
mutually agreed
to go our own separate ways.

01:40.867 --> 01:45.967
George, you don't mutually
break-up with a billionaire.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.833
Yeah, that's right,
she left me.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.933
But, you know,
I didn't stop her.

01:48.933 --> 01:52.500
Ohh...

01:52.500 --> 01:53.933
(whispers)
Here, I got that for you.

01:53.933 --> 01:55.133
Thanks.
You're welcome.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.567
Yeah.
I've got other looks, too.

01:58.933 --> 02:01.233
Okay, the three branches are

02:01.233 --> 02:04.400
Executive, Legislative
and Judicial?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.767
Excellent! Manolo, you're
gonna ace this GED test.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.067
Well, it helps having
the smartest teacher ever.

02:09.067 --> 02:13.200
(laughing)

02:13.200 --> 02:15.600
Chandra and I used
to laugh like that,

02:15.600 --> 02:17.833
but not anymore 'cause she's
marrying another man, dammit.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.700
Come on, Maronzio,
you still moping around that?

02:20.700 --> 02:21.967
Listen, like my grandmother
used to say.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.433
This is in Spanish.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.800
Cuando cierran unas
piernas otras abriren.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.467
Means, when one pair of legs
closes, another pair opens up.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.167
All right, you need
to get over it.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.733
It's no good, George.

02:33.733 --> 02:35.567
I'm never gonna find anyone
as good as Chandra.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.067
Look at her.
Look at this angel.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.900
Oh, yeah,
she's beautiful, damn.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.067
You had some of that?

02:41.067 --> 02:43.433
What, did you used
to be rich or something?
No.

02:43.433 --> 02:44.867
Maybe her mom, like,
made her clothes?

02:44.867 --> 02:46.800
Didn't make 'em good
and kids made fun of her.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.600
Or maybe she just got teased
for being fine at a young age?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.467
Or maybe she's got that thing
where she thinks she's fat

02:52.467 --> 02:54.233
but she's skinny.
Body dysmorphia.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.667
Maronzio probably has
that but the opposite.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.233
That's probably why he thought
he could do better.

02:57.233 --> 02:58.900
That's true.
What are you
packin' down there?

02:58.900 --> 03:02.300
Y'all don't understand,
we had something beautiful.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.533
And now it's gone.
Oh, yeah, it's gone.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.467
'Cause you are never
gonna get something like that.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.800
Uh, never.
Mmm-mmm- mmm.
She be, like, whoa.

03:07.800 --> 03:08.867
So, I should just give up?

03:08.867 --> 03:11.967
Get used to having nobody,
having nothing?

03:11.967 --> 03:14.233
No! You can't give up!

03:14.233 --> 03:15.433
I usually don't disagree
with George,

03:15.433 --> 03:16.700
but in matters of the heart,

03:16.700 --> 03:19.100
sometimes I think he could
be a little shortsighted.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.800
This spoken by a blind man.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.967
Sweetheart, if you saw
the picture, though.

03:22.967 --> 03:25.133
Bro, you need to try
to get her back.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.067
It may only be
one out of 100 chance,

03:26.067 --> 03:28.267
but still, that's one percent.

03:28.267 --> 03:30.467
Don't go bragging about
that, that's a easy one.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.600
And then if we're
talking probabilities,

03:32.600 --> 03:34.300
she's either gonna
say yes or no.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.233
So, you still
got a 50% chance.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.667
Isn't that right, Teach?

03:37.667 --> 03:38.700
Well, technically...

03:38.700 --> 03:41.367
You're right, Manolo,
I'm not giving up.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.600
What'd you get that
boy all riled up for?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.967
You know that fine bitch
is just gonna curb him again.

03:49.733 --> 03:51.967
(Rachel on phone)
Yes, of course.
Of course, yeah.

03:51.967 --> 03:53.133
Come in.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.733
Okay, gotta go.

03:55.733 --> 03:57.567
(hangs up phone)

03:57.567 --> 03:58.733
So, what is going
on with "Valleys"?

03:58.733 --> 04:00.367
You're still gonna
fight for it, right?

04:00.367 --> 04:03.433
Hey, the only thing
I'm fighting for is my job.

04:03.433 --> 04:04.867
I got a new boss,
Greg Shupp.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.100
Wasn't that guy fired
from Comedy Central?

04:07.100 --> 04:10.900
Oh, and then fired as the VP of
Original Programming at Xbox?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.267
That's him.

04:12.267 --> 04:13.600
Get me a meeting.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.700
Fine.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.167
By the way,
keep Pfeiffer away from me.

04:16.167 --> 04:17.233
You got it.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.700
Has she been asking about me?

04:19.700 --> 04:21.500
No, screw it.
Keep her away from me.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.367
Hey, I'm trying to keep
her away from me, too.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.367
She keeps calling
but I am not answering.

04:25.367 --> 04:27.067
Good, 'cause she's poison.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.300
No kidding.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.667
Sweet poison...
Like antifreeze.

04:31.667 --> 04:32.867
Hmm?

04:32.867 --> 04:35.267
It's a plot point from a show
I developed last season.

04:35.267 --> 04:37.267
Oh, I know, I read it.

04:37.267 --> 04:38.067
Very compelling.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.067
You did a great job
with the Lopez Grill.

04:42.067 --> 04:45.267
Now, let's see if you can
move other product, okay?

04:45.267 --> 04:46.533
All right, okay.

04:46.533 --> 04:47.733
(soundstage bell rings)

04:47.733 --> 04:49.067
(woman)
Okay, people,
we're going in five,

04:49.067 --> 04:52.633
four, three...

04:52.633 --> 04:53.967
Hey, what's up?
I'm here-- Hey, what's up?

04:53.967 --> 04:57.700
Today, I'm here to tell you
about the Burger Dogger.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.300
It's for people who
like their hamburgers

04:59.300 --> 05:01.467
shaped like a hot dog.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.533
Mmm, I could sure go for
one of those right now.

05:04.533 --> 05:05.933
Um, imagine how
much you can save

05:05.933 --> 05:07.233
if you didn't have to
go out and buy a burger.

05:07.233 --> 05:09.233
Hector...
Or a dog.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.300
Hector, do the CTA.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.267
Call to Action.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.067
So, call now

05:13.067 --> 05:17.433
and you can start
Burger Doggering... right away.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.733
Okay, that thing isn't moving.

05:20.733 --> 05:24.367
And it's not the product.
Janelle sold 50, 000 in an hour.

05:26.067 --> 05:26.200
We need a new plan.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.767
The network brought
in a new guy, Greg Shupp.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.800
So, let's see where
we stand with him.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.433
Wait a minute, what are you so
worried about?

05:35.433 --> 05:36.233
Thought you said
he was a big fan of mine.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.633
That's just something you say.

05:38.633 --> 05:40.400
All right, check out
the signature on the bottom.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.433
That makes it
worth $1,000 more.

05:43.433 --> 05:45.600
I mean, I almost felt
stupid for buying it.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.233
No, come on, it's not stupid,
Olly, it's not stupid.

05:47.233 --> 05:50.933
Right? My business manager
was so mad at me.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.567
But collectible footwear
is a solid investment.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.367
Anyway, you guys aren't
here to look at my sneakers.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.800
Oh, but we're so glad we did.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.667
Absolutely, it's
a fascinating world.
Yeah.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.133
(Olly)
Actually, we did wanna talk
to you about "Valleys."

06:03.133 --> 06:07.267
And just see if you're
happy with the script or...

06:07.267 --> 06:09.467
Yeah, I love it, it's perfect.

06:09.467 --> 06:12.333
Okay, because if you
had any notes, any notes.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.800
We could tweak it.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.300
No, no, I wouldn't
change a thing.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.467
You hear that, Olly?
Mm-hmm.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.700
That's insane,
no notes, wow.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.433
(chuckling)
Okay, okay.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.533
I'm following your eyes...

06:22.533 --> 06:23.867
to my old school Reeboks.

06:26.133 --> 06:29.633
Yeah, there is quite a story
behind these kicks, right?

06:29.633 --> 06:31.533
Everybody was all
Air Jordans at the time.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.267
And don't get me wrong,
those were game changers.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.300
You see the red stitching?
Yeah.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.067
Oh, my God,
that was a disaster.

06:38.067 --> 06:40.800
What are you talking about?
He was smiling the whole time.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.167
Mostly when he was talking
about his shoe collection,

06:42.167 --> 06:44.900
but when he was talking about
"Valleys" too, he was smiling.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.433
Nobody smiles when they're
about to greenlight a show.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.167
They're way too terrified.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.467
What are you talking about?

06:50.467 --> 06:51.967
Didn't you hear him?
No notes!

06:51.967 --> 06:53.667
No notes!
That's the kiss of death.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.667
What? No notes
is the kiss of death?

06:55.667 --> 06:56.500
All these guys,
they want their

06:56.500 --> 06:58.500
fingerprints all
over everything.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.633
So, no notes either means
he didn't read the script,

07:01.633 --> 07:02.333
or he doesn't give
a damn about the script.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.300
Probably both.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.233
That dork.

07:06.233 --> 07:07.233
So, what do we do now?
Are we screwed?

07:07.233 --> 07:08.933
Not yet.

07:08.933 --> 07:10.367
He only wants to kill
"Valleys" because if it works,

07:10.367 --> 07:12.533
it doesn't do him any good.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
He doesn't get
the credit for it.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.533
But he has to have
a good reason to kill it,

07:15.533 --> 07:17.233
otherwise he looks
like a racist.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.767
Or because we have Coco,
transphobic.

07:18.767 --> 07:20.433
So, we just gotta make sure

07:20.433 --> 07:22.567
we don't give him
that reason, okay?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.933
No drama, no budget issues,
no nothing.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.500
All right, take it easy,
you look a little overwhelmed.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.933
(sighs)
Oh, look, shoes.

07:27.933 --> 07:31.233
Oh, yeah, you looking
for the dipshit?

07:31.233 --> 07:33.233
Third door on the left.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.200
I know what we have to do.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.100
We have to keep
the ball rolling.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.533
I'm gonna get the network
to commit to a table reading.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.067
Yeah, I think that's perfect.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.700
Because once they hear it,
they're gonna love it,

07:40.700 --> 07:42.100
and they'll be hooked.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.067
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.
What do you mean?

07:45.067 --> 07:46.733
Legal and Human Resources never
show up to pat you on the back

07:46.733 --> 07:48.333
and tell you
everything's going great.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.367
Hi.
George...

07:49.367 --> 07:51.867
Camilla, from Human Resources.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.933
Hey, what's happening,
Camilla from Human Resources?

07:53.933 --> 07:55.967
That sounds like you harvest
organs on the side.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.233
(laughs)

07:57.233 --> 07:58.200
That joke's okay, right?

07:58.200 --> 07:58.867
Legal will allow it.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.733
So, we have an issue.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.433
Coco has missed several
publicity sessions.

08:03.433 --> 08:06.067
As well as
her medical exam.

08:06.067 --> 08:08.133
Oh, I think it's kind of early
in the whole thing, right?

08:08.133 --> 08:09.567
All this stuff can be
rescheduled, right, Olly?

08:09.567 --> 08:11.300
Absolutely.
Yeah.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.733
There are also rumors of
possible drug use and abuse.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.433
Legal has to make sure
if Coco is a reasonable risk

08:16.433 --> 08:18.567
to even consider production.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.867
You've seen the stories.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.200
Someone needs to talk to Coco
and get her in line.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.433
Mm-hmm, I agree.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.067
And that someone
needs to be you.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.700
Okay, come on,
why do I have to talk to Coco?

08:34.700 --> 08:37.133
Well, Coco trusts you.
Coco sees you as a friend.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.767
And the studio is not
fully indemnified.

08:40.767 --> 08:41.567
If anyone from the network
broached these issues,

08:41.567 --> 08:43.867
we'd be vulnerable to a lawsuit.

08:43.867 --> 08:45.600
I mean, seriously, now you
got me talking to everybody.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.133
I didn't wanna talk to anybody!

08:47.133 --> 08:49.067
So, if you prefer,
we can just cancel the show.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.067
No, we don't have to do that.
We'll have a conversation.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.133
Everything okay?

08:52.133 --> 08:54.400
I heard there's a problem.
Well, apparently--

08:54.400 --> 08:57.167
No-no, no-no, apparently,
we're all on the same page.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.233
It's rare that that happens,
but it feels good, doesn't it?

09:00.233 --> 09:01.600
Yeah, So you don't need
to worry about anything, Greg.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.767
Just worry about
that shoe collection

09:02.767 --> 09:04.433
and building it and keeping it
bright and white.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.333
(chuckling)
Ah-ha-ha...

09:06.333 --> 09:08.333
You don't worry
about my sneakers.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.200
You worry about this show.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.633
How'd you hear
about this place?

09:14.633 --> 09:16.233
I did a great review
for them on Holla.

09:16.233 --> 09:19.900
So, I'm sort of a celebrity
around here now, so...

09:21.667 --> 09:25.933
Congratulations on your
well-earned success.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.433
Well, congratulations on
you keeping your fine figure.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.700
And, if I might say...

09:30.700 --> 09:34.267
That behind can get six stars,
holler, okay?

09:34.267 --> 09:35.733
At the ass.
You are stupid.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.667
Maronzio, you know what?
Despite what I said earlier,

09:37.667 --> 09:39.300
I really hope
we can stay friends.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.700
Of course, baby,
we have history.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.433
Kids, someday grandkids.
Watch your mouth.

09:44.433 --> 09:45.533
But we'll always be
in each other's lives.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.533
I wish you nothing
but happiness.

09:47.533 --> 09:51.733
Okay, good, I'm glad because...

09:51.733 --> 09:54.067
Dwayne thought you were gonna--
Uh, no-no-no-no.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.200
No, no more take
of Dwayne, all right?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.367
You know what?
My good man!

09:58.367 --> 10:00.467
Some prestidigitation
for the lady.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.767
Uh!

10:05.467 --> 10:07.500
Huh?! What?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.633
(laughing)

10:09.633 --> 10:12.000
I see why you won
"America's Got Talent."

10:12.000 --> 10:14.200
Come here, let me help you out.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.500
Thank you, sir.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.767
Oh, and would you mind checking
on the status of my paella?

10:19.767 --> 10:22.067
You don't even
know what that is.

10:22.067 --> 10:25.533
(line ringing)
Oh, come on, Coco. Damn!

10:25.533 --> 10:26.967
She's still not
answering her phone.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.733
I'm not even sure what
I'm gonna say to her.

10:28.733 --> 10:32.233
This would be a lot
easier over drinks.
What the hell is he wearing?

10:32.233 --> 10:35.033
Tired of spending all that time
peeling a hard-boiled egg?

10:35.033 --> 10:38.200
Well, problem solved.
With the Eggs-It!

10:38.200 --> 10:39.033
All you have to...
(clattering to floor)

10:39.033 --> 10:41.200
Eggs-It? What the hell is that?

10:41.200 --> 10:42.733
All you have to do is load
the device... All you--

10:42.733 --> 10:44.200
(clatters to floor)

10:44.200 --> 10:45.467
Baby, you're so lucky
you can't see this.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.433
And chop it...

10:48.533 --> 10:51.700
(George)
Yeah, listen, I know you
don't drink, man, but try this.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.200
What happened, dude,
you were killing it.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.667
Now you can't sell nothing?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.633
To be honest,
I don't know, G.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.733
I was doing great
with your grills,

10:57.733 --> 10:59.167
but then I got
a cold streak.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.367
Okay, I couldn't sell any
Sock It To Me's either.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.500
Sock It To Me?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.767
I think it helps you
pull your socks up...

11:04.767 --> 11:08.667
faster or more accurately,
I don't know.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.600
Anyway, Lori lost
faith in me.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.700
She's not gonna
use me anymore.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.933
Damn, I'm sorry, Hector,
that sucks.

11:15.933 --> 11:18.067
Yeah, no, I wish I could
just sell your grills.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.967
I mean, they actually
do char evenly, it's amazing.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.100
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.133
You know what?
You lit up, you--

11:25.133 --> 11:27.433
You could only sell things
that you believe in.

11:27.433 --> 11:28.700
You're like me,
that's the way I am.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.233
You're right.

11:30.233 --> 11:31.900
Hey, you think you can
talk to Lori for me?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.300
Get me one more chance?

11:33.300 --> 11:35.700
Uh, you know, uh,
Lori and I broke up--

11:35.700 --> 11:37.300
mutual, you know...

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
Really?!
Whoo, she's a unicorn.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.233
How you let that
one get away?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.400
Uh, mm, ahh...

11:41.400 --> 11:42.667
Uh, mmm...

11:42.667 --> 11:45.133
All right, fine, listen,
I'll talk to her.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.700
You know, why not?
I talk to everybody else.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.500
You didn't wait for me.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.767
(man)
GVN auditions, round seven.

11:51.767 --> 11:54.133
(woman)
There's got to be a better way.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.167
(woman 2)
There's gotta
be a better way.

11:56.167 --> 11:59.400
(man)
There's gotta, gotta,
gotta be a better way!

11:59.400 --> 12:01.567
Oh, don't try to
make it your own.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.800
Hey...

12:03.800 --> 12:04.667
Hi.
George?
Hi.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.700
You got a second?
We're not...

12:06.700 --> 12:07.733
doing this, are we?

12:07.733 --> 12:09.333
No, no, this isn't about us.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.867
This is about,
uh, Hector.

12:10.867 --> 12:11.933
He wanted me to ask you
to give him another shot.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.300
George, I've been
doing this a long time,

12:14.300 --> 12:15.767
and when a seller
loses his confidence,

12:15.767 --> 12:17.200
there's no coming back.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.167
Yeah, but, I don't
think that's the case.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.200
I think, you know,
Hector's got this quirk

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
that he can only sell
things he believes in.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.933
Well, this isn't
the place for him then.

12:25.933 --> 12:26.600
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Oh.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.800
(both chuckle)

12:28.800 --> 12:30.167
Uh, do you really
think it's that?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.800
Yeah, I mean,
he's an earnest kid.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.200
I think he's too
young to be jaded.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.767
All right.
You talked me into it.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.833
Oh, okay, thanks,
I appreciate that.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.333
Wow, look at us, huh?

12:39.333 --> 12:41.633
Two adults having a civil,
post break-up conversation.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.567
That's new territory for me.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.933
Not for me.
Oh.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.733
Uh, so how is
your show going?

12:47.733 --> 12:50.800
Oh, it's going...
Uh, you know, not good.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.233
You know, Coco's
partying all the time.

12:53.233 --> 12:54.600
She's missing appointments
and putting, like,

12:54.600 --> 12:55.633
the whole show in jeopardy.

12:55.633 --> 12:58.200
Oh.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.533
Well, there's no time
to put her in detox.

13:00.533 --> 13:03.200
You know, I manufacture an
energy drink that we claim

13:03.200 --> 13:04.667
has a lot
of medicinal properties.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.067
Now the FDA won't let us
sell it anymore.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.333
So, I could have them
load a pallet of it

13:08.333 --> 13:09.867
in the back of your
car if you'd like.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.233
Yeah, all right,
I appreciate that.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.667
And Hector too.
That's nice, thanks.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.867
Oh, and George?
Hmm?

13:14.867 --> 13:16.867
In my experience,
these kind of issues

13:16.867 --> 13:19.867
are always about something else.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.567
You just need
to find out what.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.533
I appreciate that.
All right, thanks.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.733
There you are.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.733
You've been ignoring
my calls all day.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.267
Yeah, well, some people
get the hint.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.667
I don't wanna talk to you.
Is that woke enough for you?

13:42.667 --> 13:43.767
What did I do?

13:43.767 --> 13:45.400
It's not what you did.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.767
It's who you did.
And the answer is everyone.

13:48.767 --> 13:49.633
Now because of you,
"Valleys" might be dead.

13:49.633 --> 13:52.067
Oh, come on.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.567
No, you blew into town
like you always do.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.433
I take care of you
like an idiot.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.267
And then you find some way
to mess things up for me.

13:58.267 --> 14:00.900
Well, you're just blaming me
like you always do

14:00.900 --> 14:02.433
for your sad, pathetic life.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.267
It should be obvious by now,

14:04.267 --> 14:06.667
but if it isn't,
you're fired.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.900
**

14:09.900 --> 14:12.133
And give me back my shampoo!

14:16.267 --> 14:17.800
Hey, Olly, it's George.
Just checking in.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.433
I'm out here
looking for Coco.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.133
If you hear anything
new about "Valleys",

14:21.133 --> 14:22.867
give me a call, all right?

14:22.867 --> 14:23.600
Or text me, bye.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.867
(music playing)

14:29.867 --> 14:34.367
Hey, oh, uh, Miss?

14:34.367 --> 14:36.933
George Lopez?

14:36.933 --> 14:38.633
Oh, uh, right, okay.
(shutter clicks)

14:38.633 --> 14:39.733
Oh, you're on the DL.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.967
No... well, kind of.

14:41.967 --> 14:43.633
I'm looking for
a friend of mine, Coco.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.700
Coco at the bar?
Or Coco in the cage?

14:46.700 --> 14:47.733
I'ma start at the bar.

14:47.733 --> 14:50.867
She's over there, boo.

14:50.867 --> 14:53.100
(shutter clicking rapidly)

14:53.100 --> 14:54.800
Hey, there's my Coco.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.767
Drinking... ah-hah.

14:57.767 --> 15:01.067
How did you find me?
Well.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.967
I looked up transgender hangouts
on Holla.

15:02.967 --> 15:03.933
And this is the third
one I've been to

15:03.933 --> 15:05.133
and by far, the nicest one.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.433
So, how'd you get
stuck with this job?

15:06.433 --> 15:09.100
Well, you know, the network
is deathly afraid of you.

15:09.100 --> 15:09.900
So, they had a meeting
and they chose me,

15:09.900 --> 15:11.933
who's not that afraid of you.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.900
I love it when the
network is afraid of me.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.233
Yes, I know.

15:15.233 --> 15:16.333
And it can be used
to an advantage,

15:16.333 --> 15:17.267
but I don't think in this case.

15:17.267 --> 15:19.233
In this case,
may I speak freely?

15:19.233 --> 15:21.067
You're destroying
a golden opportunity.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.367
What's going on with you?
What's going on?

15:23.367 --> 15:26.067
Well, Coco realized that
Coco had no interest

15:26.067 --> 15:27.867
in being exploited like
some transgender sideshow.

15:27.867 --> 15:30.800
Okay, Coco, listen,
nobody's exploiting you.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.533
Listen, we had that meeting.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.400
We agreed that we were
gonna do this together.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.333
I need you.
What I need is another drink!

15:38.333 --> 15:39.133
Come on.

15:39.133 --> 15:40.567
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.100
You have no idea what
I go through every day.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.500
You know what?
I don't.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.767
And I'm not even gonna pretend
that I do because I don't.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.833
But, listen, I think I know
what's going on here, all right.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.067
It's called self-sabotage.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.333
And I know because
I'm kind of an expert.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.800
So, maybe you're afraid of
succeeding or afraid of failing.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.400
But whatever the reason is,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.533
you're looking for any
excuse to pack it in.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.600
You're destroying a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.333
It's not like TV is flooded
with transgender women.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.333
No.
Everybody is going to be
judging me.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.400
I know, Coco, it's not
flooded with transgender women

16:07.400 --> 16:10.100
or flooded with Latinos, okay?

16:10.100 --> 16:12.767
And people judge,
that's our world.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.067
And everybody's got baggage.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.067
But you gotta decide...

16:16.067 --> 16:18.100
how much you can carry and...

16:18.100 --> 16:20.067
you know, if you think
it's worth the trip.

16:23.267 --> 16:24.800
You're very good
with women, George.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.600
I'm not, by the way.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.333
Lori and I, we broke up.
Mutually agreed upon.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.100
No, she left me.
So, that's it?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.500
You're not gonna
fight for her?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.100
Fight for her and then,
what, we're happy?

16:38.100 --> 16:39.867
Or we're not happy?
See? Self-sabotage.

16:39.867 --> 16:44.733
You know, I've been the man.

16:44.733 --> 16:47.567
I've been the woman.

16:47.567 --> 16:50.600
I've seen relationships
from all sides.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.067
They don't just work out.

16:53.067 --> 16:53.867
You gotta make them work.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.167
You're right.

16:56.167 --> 16:58.067
Both of you are right.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.500
You're right.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.067
I think I'm gonna switch
over to coffee now.

17:02.067 --> 17:02.933
Good, good.

17:02.933 --> 17:05.100
(clears throat)

17:05.100 --> 17:06.800
After I, uh, freshen up.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.633
Yeah, you look like you've
been up for a little while.

17:10.633 --> 17:13.100
So, uh, I couldn't
help but overhear

17:13.100 --> 17:15.267
you giving Coco some advice.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.833
Can we talk... George?

17:18.833 --> 17:20.133
Yeah, why not, bartender?

17:20.133 --> 17:22.133
(deep voice)
Bartender!

17:26.133 --> 17:28.267
So, skinny-dip
in the hot tub?

17:28.267 --> 17:29.833
Maronzio, stop it.

17:29.833 --> 17:33.533
I only agreed to go out
with you because we got kids.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.767
But, when are you gonna
get it through your head?

17:35.767 --> 17:36.600
I'm getting married.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.067
Maybe you are,
maybe you're not.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.067
No, I am.
Maybe.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.100
Uh, you know what, uh...

17:42.100 --> 17:43.833
Okay, I tried to be nice.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.533
But, clearly,
that's not working.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.933
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.567
I do not love you anymore.

17:50.567 --> 17:54.100
Good, that's the last time
I'm gonna talk about it.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.900
Now, can we hit the hot tub?

17:55.900 --> 17:56.933
(laughing)
Oh, my God...

17:56.933 --> 18:00.833
Okay, you win.

18:00.833 --> 18:01.900
Hot tub?
Let's go to the hot tub.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.167
Hot tub!

18:10.867 --> 18:12.433
Are you gonna
get a swimsuit?!

18:12.433 --> 18:15.967
You don't need a swimsuit!

18:15.967 --> 18:18.667
Shit.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.100
Okay, just remove
the fourth stipulation

18:23.100 --> 18:24.600
and then this should be fine.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.067
And then I'll sign it
when we're done with it.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.200
(knocking)

18:27.200 --> 18:29.900
Uh, can you give
us the room, Steven?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.733
Yeah, thanks... Steven.

18:32.733 --> 18:33.600
Hey.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.267
George, what are
you doing here?

18:35.267 --> 18:36.067
I already told you I'm giving
Hector his job back.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.133
Yes, I know, thank you.

18:38.133 --> 18:39.067
But I'm not here
for Hector, okay?

18:39.067 --> 18:42.200
I'm here... for you, Lori.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
And I'm-- I'm here for me.
Can I sit down?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.733
Yes, please.
Okay, listen...

18:46.733 --> 18:50.567
Lori, I-- I'm a selfish
person, okay, I'm one-sided.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.367
And you're selfish
and one-sided.

18:52.367 --> 18:55.900
But, I think that if we try,
we can make it work.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.400
What does
"make it work" even mean?

18:57.400 --> 19:00.833
I don't know.
Coco... said it.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.800
And Coco knows because
Coco's been a man and a woman.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.267
That's crazy, like, men are from
Mars and women are from Venus?

19:07.267 --> 19:09.167
She's from, like, both planets.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.500
She's from Barstow,
I know all about her.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.233
I just don't wanna be dragged
into some emotional quagmire.

19:14.233 --> 19:15.367
I'm not trying to drag you--

19:15.367 --> 19:16.967
Why can't we just have fun?

19:16.967 --> 19:19.767
Why can't we just have sex?

19:19.767 --> 19:23.433
Yeah... exactly, uh...
That's what...

19:23.433 --> 19:26.200
I mean, I got long-winded but
that was really what I was...

19:26.200 --> 19:27.067
trying to say, baby.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.367
I missed you.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.600
I'm just gonna go lay down.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.267
All right, I'll call
you later on, Lori.

19:33.267 --> 19:35.867
(phone ringer playing)

19:35.867 --> 19:36.933
Hello?

19:36.933 --> 19:38.600
George, great news.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.300
Coco showed up for her medical.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.133
Sober and on time.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.267
Nice work.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.800
Oh, man, Olly,
that's great.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.367
So, what does that mean?
"Valleys" is back on track?

19:46.367 --> 19:49.367
Yup! Unless the table read
tanks.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.067
And it's tomorrow.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.133
Tomorrow?

19:52.133 --> 19:54.667
Tomorrow.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.367
Hello?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.133
* Unh, yeah, yeah

20:02.133 --> 20:04.767
* That's right, come on,
come on, come on *

20:04.767 --> 20:06.800
* Unh, yeah, yeah

20:06.800 --> 20:08.900
* Come on, oh
Come on, oh *

20:08.900 --> 20:12.600
**

20:16.800 --> 20:19.100
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:19.100 --> 20:21.400
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:21.400 --> 20:23.767
* Get your hands up,
get your hands up *

20:23.767 --> 20:26.867
* Go, go, go, go *

20:26.867 --> 20:29.667
**
