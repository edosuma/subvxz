Because of my religion?

06:12.671 --> 06:15.549
So it's just a coincidence
that all the rest of you

06:15.716 --> 06:19.136
worship He Who Watches,
while I don't?

06:19.303 --> 06:23.515
Your hatred for us
destroyed this world.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.726
And believe me,

06:25.893 --> 06:27.978
you make it so easy
to hate you.

06:28.145 --> 06:29.063
That's enough!

06:31.273 --> 06:33.650
We'll need to put aside
our differences

06:33.817 --> 06:37.529
and live in peace on the new

- Not anymore, kid.

11:43.585 --> 11:46.296
Let me guess.
He tried to eat you,

11:46.505 --> 11:47.881
so you...

11:51.468 --> 11:53.303
Live... in peace...

You're no man.

You don't have a choice.
Remember?

12:07.275 --> 12:10.028
- Commander?
- Mia, those are the rules.

12:10.237 --> 12:13.031
Necessary to rebuild
our civilization.

12:14.699 --> 12:18.328
But... if you guys
didn't take commitment oaths,

12:18.537 --> 12:21.540
well, the rule is nullified.

We pray that you continue
to watch over us.

13:31.276 --> 13:33.487
We promise to live in peace
with the inhabitants.

13:33.653 --> 13:36.281
Inhabitants? We couldn't even
live in peace back at home.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.366
We come from the same god.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.202
We're all made
in his image.

13:41.536 --> 13:42.662

14:07.354 --> 14:09.272
Please don't fuck it up
this time.

14:11.233 --> 14:14.194
[Phoenix] It's odd Zohar
changed our course.

14:14.361 --> 14:17.155
Taking us out of stasis
six months early.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.079
Let us make our new world
commitment oath.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.344
Thank you for bringing us
to this world safely.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.264
Whether it's He Who Watches,
He Who Listens,

14:42.472 --> 14:44.015
or She Who Guides.

14:44.182 --> 14:46.101
Or he who got fed up
with our bullshit

14:46.268 --> 14:47.727
and when to find
a new world.

14:50.647 --> 14:52.983
To a fresh start,

14:53.149 --> 14:55.360
free of religious divisions.

Mashante.

15:05.203 --> 15:06.705
[Mia]
We're here, Father,

15:06.871 --> 15:10.584
I promise to live by the sword
and die by the sword.

16:07.390 --> 16:10.352
[Mia] I sense this emblem
to be a symbol of goodness

16:10.518 --> 16:12.145
and protection.

16:12.312 --> 16:15.482
But sadly, it's also been used
to justify evil.

16:15.649 --> 16:18.360
An emerging power will soon
threaten this world.

16:18.526 --> 16:21.655
Could it be the same force
that destroyed Rathe?

16:21.821 --> 16:24.574
[Beset]
A good or a bad vision?

16:24.741 --> 16:28.328
[Mia] Someone very good
and kind was born in this land.

16:28.536 --> 16:30.246
But he was a Zed.

16:30.413 --> 16:32.290
[Magnum]
There are no good Zeds.

16:32.457 --> 16:34.376
[Mia] Not on Rathe, anyway.

16:37.337 --> 16:40.090
By Zohar's estimation,
we have arrived

16:40.256 --> 16:42.676
in this planet's year 2074.

16:42.842 --> 16:44.803
Many wars have
transpired here

16:44.969 --> 16:47.681
leaving the inhabitants
in a state of despair

16:47.847 --> 16:50.725
and futility, and unaware
of the apocalyptic threat

16:50.892 --> 16:53.269
that is about to be
unleashed upon them.

17:09.703 --> 17:11.329
[distant voices]

17:14.582 --> 17:15.750
[girl laughing]

17:15.916 --> 17:18.127
- Do we all understand?
- Such a crude,

17:18.294 --> 17:19.546
rudimentary language.

17:19.713 --> 17:21.881
What does "like, whatever" mean?

17:22.048 --> 17:24.300
It's a dismissive response
to a question.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.136
I hope they don't
have tentacles.

17:26.301 --> 17:29.180
Mm, none as big as your
tentacle, I'm sure.

17:30.932 --> 17:32.809
No, three minutes more.

17:32.976 --> 17:34.728
Ohh.

17:34.936 --> 17:36.563
And I was like, "Whatever."

17:36.730 --> 17:38.565
I thought it might be a wolf.

17:38.732 --> 17:40.734
When have you heard
a wolf cluck?

17:43.737 --> 17:45.530
[laughs, scoffs]

17:46.990 --> 17:48.658
Who the fuck are you?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.369
I'm Thora.
This is my committed, Magnum.

17:51.536 --> 17:53.663
This is Phoenix and Beset,
who are committed.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.915
- [Girl #1] Committed for what?
- To procreate.

18:03.590 --> 18:06.259
Hold that for me,
would ya, sweetheart?

18:09.554 --> 18:12.599
- Hello, Wolfie.
- Hello.

18:12.766 --> 18:14.392
Procreate often?

18:14.601 --> 18:16.311
In two minutes
I'm about to.

18:16.478 --> 18:17.645
Ya see, Noa?

18:17.812 --> 18:21.232
The direct approach
works every time.

18:21.399 --> 18:22.776
[grunts]

18:22.942 --> 18:24.194
He's mine.

18:24.402 --> 18:26.196
[laughing]

18:27.697 --> 18:29.365
Jealous much?

18:33.745 --> 18:35.455
Are you committed?

18:35.622 --> 18:39.209
- Not yet.
- Well, you came to the right place.

18:39.375 --> 18:42.253
Bunch of horny guys, drunk,
ready to pounce.

18:42.420 --> 18:45.340
Ready to mount
anything that moves.

18:45.507 --> 18:46.841
Try, and I'll toss them

18:47.008 --> 18:49.260
in their tribe's
designated fire pit myself.

18:49.469 --> 18:50.428
[scoffs]

19:02.524 --> 19:05.401
Okay.
Bye-bye, weirdos.

19:10.073 --> 19:11.991
Come on, Noa.

19:34.013 --> 19:36.891
Did you believe one word
from those freaks?

19:43.064 --> 19:44.691
Let go of me!

19:50.780 --> 19:53.950
Well, hello, sexy.
Up for procreating?

19:55.702 --> 19:57.036
Come on.

20:21.436 --> 20:24.063
Excuse me. ls there somewhere
we can go and mate?

20:24.272 --> 20:26.357
Uh, just behind
the tent there.

20:26.524 --> 20:27.859
[Magnum, Beset laugh]

[Magnum, Beset moaning]

20:58.139 --> 20:59.724
[both moaning]

21:04.520 --> 21:08.024
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

21:08.191 --> 21:09.734
Nothing like
getting your hands dirty

21:09.901 --> 21:11.694
to bring out
other primordial urges.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.404
- Aunt India!
- What?

21:13.571 --> 21:15.990
- Why do you always have to be so...
- Blunt? Factual?

21:16.157 --> 21:18.034
Scientific? Direct? Truthful?

21:18.201 --> 21:19.577
To the point?

21:19.744 --> 21:21.829
An archeologist
never beats around the bush.

21:22.038 --> 21:23.998
Unless he's a hot archeologist,

21:24.207 --> 21:27.126
in which that case,
he could beat around mine.

21:27.293 --> 21:29.420
Stop! ls sex all
anyone wants to do tonight?

21:29.587 --> 21:31.089
[All] Yes!

21:31.255 --> 21:33.049
[Magnum, Beset
continue moaning]

21:33.216 --> 21:35.927
How is it that an aunt
is less uptight than her niece?

21:36.135 --> 21:39.889
We humans wouldn't exist if it
weren't for sex. You know that.

21:40.056 --> 21:42.058
Yeah, but you don't
have to broadcast it.

21:42.266 --> 21:45.061
Of course we do. Look at every
male in the animal kingdom,

21:45.228 --> 21:47.063
prancing about
to entice a female.

21:47.271 --> 21:49.482
I meant humans.

21:49.649 --> 21:52.819
Guys revving motorcycles,
girls in high-heeled shoes,

21:52.986 --> 21:55.530
tattoos, stylish clothing,

21:55.738 --> 21:58.116
fancy cars, hairstyles,

21:58.282 --> 22:00.827
jewelry, muscles...

22:00.994 --> 22:02.662
boob jobs?

22:02.870 --> 22:05.123
You know, everything we do
is an attention-seeking means

22:05.289 --> 22:06.749
to attract a partner.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.835
Hello. I'm India Jones.

22:09.002 --> 22:11.879
I'm Beset. This is Mia, Phoenix,

22:12.046 --> 22:15.091
and that is Magnum
mating with his Thora.

22:15.299 --> 22:16.801
[moans continue]

22:16.968 --> 22:18.594
"Mating." You see, Noa,

22:18.803 --> 22:20.179
that is a much better word
for sex.

22:20.346 --> 22:22.598
It aligns us with animals,
right where we belong.

22:22.765 --> 22:24.976
Are you from a local kibbutz?

22:25.143 --> 22:27.729
Uh, is there any room
at the inn?

22:27.895 --> 22:29.022
[softly] Why did I say that.

22:32.942 --> 22:34.027
[Magnum exhales]

22:34.235 --> 22:36.029
Oh, my God.

22:36.237 --> 22:37.613
Excuse me, ma'am.

22:37.780 --> 22:38.948
You know where
I can rest my wife?

22:41.284 --> 22:43.619
[gunfire on TV]

22:52.170 --> 22:53.755
This broadcast video format
is like

22:53.921 --> 22:55.548
the crude information
dissemination device

22:55.715 --> 22:59.093
we had on Rathe
before evolving to telepathy.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.184
This place is a mess.

23:06.350 --> 23:08.227
And all over
religious differences...

23:08.394 --> 23:09.771
the same as Rathe.

23:09.937 --> 23:11.856
Why did we end up here?

23:12.023 --> 23:14.609
Maybe to warn them.

23:22.116 --> 23:24.118
We find more
at lower elevations,

23:24.285 --> 23:26.496
near ancient streams
and watering holes

23:26.662 --> 23:28.706
where animals are killed
while drinking.

23:28.873 --> 23:31.542
Animals, yes, but Zeds
are more commonly found

23:31.709 --> 23:33.503
where they were buried
or burned.

23:33.669 --> 23:35.213
Right above the water line.

23:35.379 --> 23:38.925
- What are Zeds?
- Tortured souls of the human dead.

23:40.635 --> 23:41.969
What the hell.
Lead the way.

23:56.734 --> 23:59.028
Don't be scared, Mia. An
animal probably found the body

23:59.195 --> 24:01.864
and damaged it
before it was even buried.

24:02.031 --> 24:05.993
It's not an animal...
and they don't get scared.

24:13.334 --> 24:14.961
Attention, please!

24:15.169 --> 24:17.255
We're gonna be moving
the dig over this way.

24:17.421 --> 24:18.756
Mia just found something

24:18.923 --> 24:20.758
that appears to be
Neanderthal remains.

24:27.306 --> 24:29.016
What are you sensing?

24:29.183 --> 24:33.938
The god of this planet,
the same as ours.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.816
But he takes a more active role
in affairs here.

24:50.913 --> 24:52.582
[India]
I'll be gone about an hour

24:52.748 --> 24:55.293
depending on how many questions
our financing source asks.

24:55.501 --> 24:57.712
Thanks to you,
we have the skulls to show

24:57.879 --> 24:59.213
that we're making progress.

24:59.380 --> 25:02.675
You're welcome.
But I wouldn't call it progress.

25:02.842 --> 25:04.594
More of a warning
you should heed.

25:04.802 --> 25:06.762
Are you always this ominous?

25:06.929 --> 25:09.056
Only before
a planet's destruction.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.726
I'll give them a tour.

25:11.934 --> 25:14.145
Okay. Good.
Well, have fun.

25:14.312 --> 25:17.356
Or be ominous.
Whatever turns you on.

25:41.255 --> 25:43.090
[boys speaking Hebrew]

25:43.257 --> 25:45.718
No, no, no, no, no!
Pay! Pay! No, no!

25:48.095 --> 25:50.181
Don't you guys have money
where you come from?

25:50.348 --> 25:52.266
[man] Give it up, old lady!
Give it up!

25:52.433 --> 25:54.060
- My parcel... Ohhh!
- Hey!

25:54.268 --> 25:55.895
[woman shouting]

26:01.067 --> 26:02.360
Sleep.

26:04.028 --> 26:05.863
Th-There is a God.

26:06.072 --> 26:08.115
[laughs]
Thank you, human.

26:08.282 --> 26:10.326
You can call me Magnum.

26:32.556 --> 26:34.016
[music, no audible dialogue]

26:43.901 --> 26:46.320
[no audible dialogue]

27:17.184 --> 27:20.730
[Mia] Within this wall
is the force of a god's power.

27:20.938 --> 27:23.691
An energy stronger
than I've ever felt,

27:23.899 --> 27:28.279
and festering like a cosmic
storm ready to escape its cage.

27:28.446 --> 27:31.824
It is the source of all that is
good and evil in this world.

27:31.991 --> 27:34.160
And if my visions are true,

27:34.368 --> 27:36.871
then this force is about
to be harnessed by evil

27:37.038 --> 27:38.372
for evil's sake.

27:38.539 --> 27:40.791
Unless we can stop it.

27:52.511 --> 27:55.389
[distant shouting]

27:59.935 --> 28:01.520
[crowd whistling, cheering]

28:25.503 --> 28:28.130
- Aunt India, it's creepy as hell.
- I know.

28:28.339 --> 28:30.299
Any thoughts?

28:32.093 --> 28:33.386
You wouldn't believe us.

28:33.552 --> 28:36.430
Try me. I always keep
an open mind.

28:36.639 --> 28:40.059
[Magnum]
should we tell her?

28:40.226 --> 28:43.437
We found the same type of
skeleton where we came from...

28:43.604 --> 28:45.481
as part of our pre-history,
as well.

28:45.648 --> 28:48.317
- They were dead.
- Yes. They're dead.

28:48.484 --> 28:50.778
They were already dead
when they were killed.

28:50.945 --> 28:53.364
Well, yes, there have
been instances of warring tribes

28:53.572 --> 28:56.450
who dug up and mutilated
dead bodies of other tribes,

28:56.617 --> 28:59.870
purely for disrespect
and humiliation.

29:00.037 --> 29:02.039
They didn't mutilate dead bodies...
they killed the dead.

29:02.206 --> 29:04.208
Do you understand
the difference?

29:04.375 --> 29:06.043
Not in the slightest.

29:06.210 --> 29:08.421
Dead people rose from the dead
and had to be killed again.

29:08.587 --> 29:12.091
You're good. I actually thought
you might know something.

29:15.094 --> 29:17.930
In fifth grade,
kids would make fun of me

29:18.139 --> 29:21.100
because of my interest
in archeology and paleontology.

29:21.267 --> 29:22.393
I mean,
who could blame them?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.563
My parents did name me
India Jones.

29:25.729 --> 29:28.232
One time,
even a teacher joined in.

29:28.441 --> 29:30.317
In the site where he knew
I was digging,

29:30.484 --> 29:32.570
he buried some KFC chicken
bones,

29:32.736 --> 29:35.197
setting them
in the shape of a bird.

29:35.364 --> 29:38.367
I dug them up, and he joked
that they might be prehistoric

29:38.534 --> 29:41.454
and suggested that I send them
to the Natural History Museum

29:41.620 --> 29:42.955
for analysis.

29:43.122 --> 29:44.999
A week later,
while watching the news,

29:45.166 --> 29:48.377
I saw the museum curator
holding my set of chicken bones

29:48.544 --> 29:50.963
and the letter with
my name and address on it.

29:51.172 --> 29:53.966
He called them "extra-crispy
Jurassic bones."

29:54.133 --> 29:56.260
India, we can reminisce
about your life

29:56.427 --> 29:57.970
when you're lying
in your coffin.

29:58.137 --> 30:00.431
I guess I won't be fantasizing
about you anymore.

30:00.639 --> 30:02.516
Mia has something
important to say.

30:02.683 --> 30:04.435
She was too polite
to interrupt your boring

30:04.602 --> 30:06.353
and excruciatingly long story.

30:06.520 --> 30:10.483
There's something buried
at the bottom of the Dead Sea.

30:10.649 --> 30:13.027
And it's not those KFD bones.

30:13.235 --> 30:15.362
She probably doesn't even know
what KFC is,

30:15.571 --> 30:17.615
or McDonald's, I suspect.

30:17.781 --> 30:19.325
She has a gift.

30:19.492 --> 30:22.119
Mia did find the skull
that got us additional funding.

30:22.286 --> 30:25.164
I owe you. As long as you don't
tell me that the chicken bones

30:25.331 --> 30:26.373
were dead when they were killed.

30:26.540 --> 30:27.917
Of course not.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.960
Bird bones don't return
from the dead.

30:30.127 --> 30:31.378
At least I understand that much.

30:31.545 --> 30:33.005
Unless the chickens' brains
and ligaments

30:33.172 --> 30:35.216
were still intact;
then they might.

30:35.382 --> 30:38.969
- If this is a joke...
- There's nothing funny about the living dead.

30:39.136 --> 30:40.429
Remember way back when
before the first Reawakening?

30:40.596 --> 30:42.223
When only five emerged?

30:42.389 --> 30:43.933
That was pretty interesting...

30:44.099 --> 30:45.601
and darkly humorous.

30:45.768 --> 30:48.020
A few dead were
scientific curiosities

30:48.187 --> 30:49.230
and we could joke about it.

30:49.396 --> 30:50.898
When there are millions of them

30:51.106 --> 30:53.234
and they outnumber the living
ten-to-one,

30:53.400 --> 30:54.652
not so funny anymore.

30:54.818 --> 30:56.529
We'll just say
they had the last laugh.

30:56.737 --> 30:58.531
You're an odd bunch.

30:58.739 --> 31:00.407
What planet
did you say you're from?

31:00.574 --> 31:02.159
[Thora] I already
confided in India

31:02.326 --> 31:03.661
that we're extraterrestrials.

31:03.827 --> 31:06.121
She laughed and made
a reference to "phoning home."

31:06.288 --> 31:07.498
[Magnum] I very much like her,

31:07.706 --> 31:09.625
but if India Jones
is considered among

31:09.792 --> 31:11.627
the most open-minded
of the Earth humans,

31:11.835 --> 31:13.462
as she attests...

31:13.671 --> 31:15.130
[Mia] It doesn't bode well
for the rest of the people

31:15.339 --> 31:16.465
on this planet.

31:16.674 --> 31:18.467
[India]
I swear they're communicating.

31:18.634 --> 31:21.220
Maybe these people are
not from Earth after all.

31:21.387 --> 31:22.680
[Thora]
That's what I told you.

31:26.183 --> 31:28.060
[India] Where are you guys
from, exactly?

31:28.227 --> 31:29.728
We're from Rathe.

31:29.895 --> 31:34.525
It's a planet in what you guys
call the "habitable zone."

31:34.692 --> 31:38.737
Rathe is in Kepler 186-F
of the Cygnus constellation.

31:41.782 --> 31:43.492
I knew there was life there.

31:43.659 --> 31:46.495
Was. Now only the dead
inhabit it.

31:46.704 --> 31:49.373
Well, at this point,
I can handle anything.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.959
You can?

31:52.167 --> 31:54.795
Okay. I'd like you
to meet my father.

31:58.340 --> 32:01.385
Good day, Ms. Jones.
I've heard so much about you.

32:04.638 --> 32:06.056
[thud]

32:07.433 --> 32:09.476
[India sighs]

32:09.643 --> 32:11.312
It's just sunstroke, Noa.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.397
Can you please go fetch
Dr. Coleman?

32:13.564 --> 32:15.482
Tell him we need to conduct
a few DNA tests...

32:15.649 --> 32:16.692
most likely several.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.361
- Sure, Aunt India.
- Thanks.

32:26.368 --> 32:30.164
[man] The Stone of Rhodesia,
as I promised.

32:30.331 --> 32:34.543
I pray you can return it safely
back to your people.

32:34.710 --> 32:37.379
[woman] The eyes of God
will be upon me.

32:37.546 --> 32:40.132
- He will guide me.
- I pray so.

32:40.299 --> 32:42.718
Agents from the Vatican
are on the hunt.

32:42.885 --> 32:44.511
You must move quickly.

32:44.678 --> 32:46.722
How much time do we have left?

32:46.889 --> 32:49.391
The morning star
returns tomorrow night.

32:49.558 --> 32:53.103
If the stone falls back
into the hands of the Vatican,

32:53.270 --> 32:56.231
evil forces will be unleashed
onto the world.

32:56.440 --> 33:00.235
Your assertion that the Pope may
be the anti-Christ,

33:00.402 --> 33:04.657
as unthinkable as it is,
may be true.

33:06.492 --> 33:11.455
I beg you, use the power
of the Stone to vanquish

33:11.622 --> 33:16.210
the satanic evils of this world
once and for all.

33:16.377 --> 33:18.295
It will be done.

33:18.462 --> 33:21.048
Or we will die trying.

33:21.215 --> 33:23.592
On behalf of the Order
of the Enlightened,

33:23.759 --> 33:26.512
you have our eternal thanks,
Father.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.731
May God be with you, my child.

33:37.898 --> 33:41.527
The fate of humanity
is now in your hands.

33:41.735 --> 33:45.155
You are a chosen one.

33:45.322 --> 33:47.241
You're so kind, Father.

33:47.408 --> 33:50.661
But your knowledge of who
now possesses the Stone

33:50.828 --> 33:53.163
poses a risk to us all.

33:53.372 --> 33:57.334
If caught,
we could be exposed.

33:57.501 --> 33:59.628
I'm sure you understand.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.591
Understand what?

34:04.758 --> 34:06.719
Why I have to do this.

34:06.885 --> 34:10.222
Aaah!-
- [knife puncturing]

34:23.025 --> 34:25.487
Shira...
what have you done?

34:27.239 --> 34:30.242
The serpent has been released
from its prison.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.663
[zipper unzips]

34:34.830 --> 34:37.833
[moaning]

35:03.734 --> 35:05.652
Now, where did you say
this head came from?

35:08.655 --> 35:11.825
- Up?
- Way, way, way, way up.

35:11.992 --> 35:14.536
There's no true up or down
in the universe.

35:14.703 --> 35:17.331
India already knows that,
my sire. She's a scientist.

35:17.539 --> 35:20.250
"Sire"? Do you keep him
around for breeding?

35:20.417 --> 35:22.252
[India]
Never mind where it came from.

35:22.419 --> 35:23.629
What did you find, David?

35:23.837 --> 35:25.547
This must be a joke, right?

35:27.424 --> 35:29.760
They don't joke around much.

35:29.968 --> 35:31.553
[sighs]
If you say so.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.182
Human beings have
23 pairs of chromosomes.

35:35.349 --> 35:39.228
Two X chromosomes, female;
or one X and one Y, male.

35:39.436 --> 35:41.480
India already knows that.
She's a scientist.

35:41.647 --> 35:43.273
Thanks, Thora. At this point,

35:43.440 --> 35:45.859
I feel like there's more
I don't know than I do know.

35:46.026 --> 35:47.903
It's all right, I think
all scientists think like that.

35:48.070 --> 35:50.697
But wouldn't it be boring
if we already knew everything?

35:50.864 --> 35:53.742
Good point.
Continue, Doc.

35:55.911 --> 35:58.789
Can somebody just
get it out of here?

35:58.956 --> 36:00.415
Come here, Father.

36:01.583 --> 36:03.460
"Father." So it is a man?

36:03.627 --> 36:07.256
Good, 'cause I can see
the X and Y chromosomes.

36:07.422 --> 36:09.591
Okay, let me explain.

36:20.811 --> 36:23.021
Now, that's a gross
simplification.

36:23.188 --> 36:26.525
The X and Y chromosomes do
actually resemble the letters,

36:26.692 --> 36:29.820
hence the names,
except in this sample.

36:29.987 --> 36:33.532
The X and Y chromosome pair
isn't a pair at all.

36:33.699 --> 36:35.951
It appears there's another line

36:36.118 --> 36:38.662
linking the two together.

36:40.664 --> 36:42.332
Like that.

36:42.499 --> 36:43.834
I've been thinking of it

36:44.001 --> 36:46.420
as the N chromosome triplet,

36:46.587 --> 36:48.297
based on the shape it makes.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.799
It's not an N chromosome.

36:52.843 --> 36:55.012
It's a Zed,

36:55.178 --> 36:57.306
Our people have found
the Zed chromosome triplet

36:57.472 --> 36:59.391
in every zombie sample
we've ever looked at.

36:59.558 --> 37:00.434
Zombies.

37:00.601 --> 37:02.769
Arrrgh. India...

37:02.936 --> 37:05.564
I'm coming for your brains!

37:05.772 --> 37:07.733
Brains! Brains!

37:07.900 --> 37:09.902
[smacks table]
This is ridiculous.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.029
They don't walk around with
their arms out and shuffle.

37:12.195 --> 37:14.615
They're fast.
And they rarely speak.

37:14.781 --> 37:17.826
What they do do is chase you
down and eat your limbic system.

37:19.494 --> 37:20.996
Eh... sorry.

37:21.163 --> 37:23.999
[Beset]
Don't... apologize...

37:24.166 --> 37:26.418
Doctor.

37:26.585 --> 37:29.713
She wants to procreate with you.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.759
[sighing]
Everybody can see that.

37:35.969 --> 37:38.931
Phoenix and I...

37:39.097 --> 37:41.475
are... procreating...

37:41.642 --> 37:42.851
right now.

37:46.146 --> 37:48.815
Well, don't you?

37:51.234 --> 37:54.363
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

37:54.571 --> 37:57.449
she's very intuitive.

37:59.493 --> 38:02.704
She's got the ability
to see...

38:02.871 --> 38:06.708
when those are ready to
procreate...

38:06.875 --> 38:08.961
before they even know.

38:10.837 --> 38:15.968
It's what you call...
a special talent.

38:16.134 --> 38:17.844
[Beset gasps]

38:18.011 --> 38:20.847
Don't be embarrassed.

38:21.014 --> 38:24.142
It's... perfectly normal.

38:27.604 --> 38:29.147
You two better hurry.

38:29.314 --> 38:32.401
Neither of you
are getting any younger.

38:34.569 --> 38:39.574
And your mating vestibule
will dry up soon.

38:41.535 --> 38:43.829
[sighs deeply]

38:43.996 --> 38:46.498
Well, thank you, Beset.

38:46.707 --> 38:48.583
We will take that
under consideration.

38:48.750 --> 38:51.420
- Uh, we will.
- Oh! My God.

38:51.586 --> 38:54.423
I meant to say... Forget it.

38:54.589 --> 38:55.841
What do we do
about the zombies?

38:56.008 --> 38:58.719
You really think
there's zombies?

38:58.885 --> 39:00.429
Well, of course not.

39:00.637 --> 39:02.597
But there's so much
we don't understand.

39:02.764 --> 39:05.100
- [Beset sighs]
- What are you grinning at?

39:07.060 --> 39:10.480
The two of you... mmm...
it makes me remember

39:10.647 --> 39:13.734
the first time Phoenix...

39:13.900 --> 39:16.028
and I mated.

39:17.779 --> 39:20.532
You two should commit
to each other

39:20.741 --> 39:22.993
and procreate...

39:23.160 --> 39:25.162
right now. Ahhh...

39:25.370 --> 39:26.997
Stop saying that, okay?

39:27.205 --> 39:30.208
There won't be any procreating
going on here.

39:30.375 --> 39:31.793
Except for that.

39:32.002 --> 39:34.546
Okay. We asked you
to run some tests

39:34.713 --> 39:35.756
on some people in this area

39:35.922 --> 39:37.466
that recently died.

39:37.632 --> 39:38.884
Did you do that?

39:39.051 --> 39:42.012
I did. I mean, it was
a bureaucratic nightmare

39:42.179 --> 39:43.764
to get the permission,
but, yeah.

39:43.972 --> 39:45.766
- What did you find?
- Well, I haven't looked

39:45.932 --> 39:47.809
at the results yet.

39:47.976 --> 39:53.231
You see, it takes time to isolate
chromosomes and pair 'em up.

39:53.398 --> 39:55.942
But I knew these people.

39:57.069 --> 39:59.029
They were all patients of mine.

39:59.237 --> 40:01.156
Well, this is...

40:01.323 --> 40:04.201
was my father.
Please check the results

40:04.367 --> 40:06.119
so you know
this is not a joke.

40:06.286 --> 40:09.081
You had a chance to get ahead
of this thing, unlike we did.

40:09.247 --> 40:11.875
I'm a physician.
What are you?

40:12.042 --> 40:13.960
[laughs]
What am I?

40:15.670 --> 40:17.005
I'm the best fighter
on the a base

40:17.172 --> 40:18.548
staffed with men and women

40:18.715 --> 40:20.759
trained to save
this civilization.

40:20.967 --> 40:22.761
All the Ratheans
you see before you

40:22.969 --> 40:26.098
are the only survivors
of that effort.

40:26.306 --> 40:27.974
We're trying to save
your civilization.

40:29.851 --> 40:31.561
Pull your head
out of your ass.

40:31.728 --> 40:33.563
Give him time.

40:33.772 --> 40:35.857
He hasn't seen
what we've seen.

40:36.024 --> 40:38.026
We don't even know
if it will happen on Earth.

40:38.193 --> 40:39.820
It's already started.

40:54.209 --> 40:56.002
Faulty test results.

40:56.169 --> 40:59.131
[laughs] I am not impressed

40:59.339 --> 41:02.134
with the intelligence
of beings on this planet.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.141
[chuckles] No wonder.

41:09.307 --> 41:11.268
They only use
10% of their brains.

41:11.434 --> 41:12.686
Nine point six.

41:12.853 --> 41:13.770
Twelve point eight.

41:15.355 --> 41:16.857
[David groans]

41:20.443 --> 41:22.070
They all show
the same thing.

41:22.237 --> 41:24.322
The 23rd chromosome pairs
haven't quite joined up

41:24.489 --> 41:25.866
to form the Z triplet yet.

41:26.032 --> 41:27.617
But in each case,
there are thin strands

41:27.784 --> 41:28.994
connecting the chromosomes,

41:29.161 --> 41:31.872
indicating the process
is already underway.

41:32.038 --> 41:33.248
You got to tell people
about this.

41:33.415 --> 41:35.333
There still may be time
to save your people.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.129
Are you insane?

41:39.296 --> 41:41.756
Do you even hear
what you're saying?

41:41.923 --> 41:45.844
Even if I can convince them to listen to your
ridiculous story, what good is that gonna do?

41:46.011 --> 41:49.264
All you have to do is get people to
stop hurting and killing each other.

41:49.431 --> 41:51.683
Then they can focus
on stopping this.

41:51.850 --> 41:54.060
Oh, yeah. Let me just
tell everyone that.

41:54.227 --> 41:56.897
I'm sure they'll stop
being mean to each other.

41:57.063 --> 41:59.024
I'll bet that's why
we were drawn here.

41:59.191 --> 42:03.695
We were... supposed to give you
information

42:03.904 --> 42:06.948
that could... save you.

42:07.115 --> 42:10.035
He Who Watches
works in mysterious ways.

42:10.202 --> 42:13.288
You need to dig up all the
non-skeletonized human remains

42:13.455 --> 42:14.956
and burn 'em.

42:15.123 --> 42:17.209
Cremation is the only way
to be safe.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.710
- Yeah.
- Yes?

42:18.877 --> 42:20.295
Yeah. Sure, let me just
get right on that.

42:20.503 --> 42:22.631
- No problem.
- [laughing]

42:22.797 --> 42:26.927
[Beset moans, sighs]

42:30.513 --> 42:32.265
So what shall we do?

42:32.474 --> 42:34.935
[Beset moans]

42:38.230 --> 42:40.232
Procreate?

42:40.398 --> 42:42.317
[chuckles]

42:46.029 --> 42:49.991
Ahhh... ahhh...

43:16.226 --> 43:18.979
[India] Lights out.
Good night, everyone.

43:19.145 --> 43:20.730
[all] Shokai.

44:10.864 --> 44:13.158
There was a messiah
on this planet.

44:13.366 --> 44:15.869
- What is that?
- Like a god.

44:16.036 --> 44:20.332
Well, He Who Watches,
or part of him, apparently.

44:20.540 --> 44:25.128
He was born right here
in this region of the world.

44:25.295 --> 44:27.464
Of all the places
we could have landed,

44:27.672 --> 44:30.884
we landed at almost
the very same spot he lived.

44:31.051 --> 44:33.178
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

44:33.345 --> 44:34.346
You know I don't
believe in coincidence,

44:34.512 --> 44:36.097
and neither do you.

44:36.264 --> 44:39.142
I feel like I'm supposed
to do something.

44:39.309 --> 44:42.103
You are. Sleep.

44:42.270 --> 44:44.272
They killed him.

44:44.439 --> 44:47.942
Some of the same people
who followed him.

44:48.109 --> 44:50.820
One of his friends
betrayed him for money.

44:50.987 --> 44:53.907
It's such a tragic story.

44:54.074 --> 44:55.909
They tortured him.

44:56.076 --> 44:58.953
Humiliated him.

44:59.120 --> 45:03.041
And nailed him to a tree
on top of a hill called Calvary.

45:03.208 --> 45:05.835
Calvary means "Skull" here.

45:06.002 --> 45:09.297
And you know the part
that scares me the most?

45:09.506 --> 45:13.927
Three days after he died,
he came back from the dead.

45:14.094 --> 45:16.554
Like a Zed?
Did he eat their brains?

45:16.721 --> 45:18.431
He should have, after they
betrayed him and killed him.

45:18.598 --> 45:21.184
I don't know. I didn't
get that far in the book.

45:21.351 --> 45:23.395
Let us read it tomorrow.

45:24.979 --> 45:26.231
Together.

45:26.398 --> 45:29.234
I'd like that.
Good night, friends.

45:29.401 --> 45:31.361
Shokai, babe.

45:43.039 --> 45:44.958
[water roaring]

46:03.476 --> 46:07.480
[distorted, cacophonous sounds]

46:22.579 --> 46:24.164
[no audible dialogue]

46:31.087 --> 46:33.465
Why did they
do this to you?

46:33.673 --> 46:35.216
Why did you let them?

46:35.383 --> 46:37.927
My father asked me to.

46:38.094 --> 46:42.015
Your father?
He must be cruel.

46:43.308 --> 46:46.436
Never. But he can be tough.

46:46.603 --> 46:48.396
Can I help you?

46:48.605 --> 46:51.357
My father
will help me.

46:51.524 --> 46:53.526
What you can do
is help out humanity

46:53.735 --> 46:56.404
which teeters on the verge
of Armageddon today.

46:56.571 --> 46:58.907
That is why I brought you here.

47:00.200 --> 47:03.328
If you think I can,
I will.

47:03.495 --> 47:07.165
Hurry. The dead
are preparing to rise.

47:21.471 --> 47:23.306
[shouts in agony]

47:24.724 --> 47:27.227
[panting, whimpering]

47:30.438 --> 47:32.649
- Sister.
- [crying]

47:32.815 --> 47:35.985
He died to save
this planet's people.

47:36.152 --> 47:38.613
And now he's asking
for our help to do it again.

47:40.156 --> 47:42.575
- The dead!
- The dead have risen?

47:42.742 --> 47:44.118
What?

47:44.285 --> 47:46.287
No, the Dead Sea.

47:46.454 --> 47:47.664
It's disappearing.

48:05.390 --> 48:08.351
What sort of apocalyptic cult
have we got ourselves

48:08.518 --> 48:09.727
wrapped up in here?

48:09.894 --> 48:12.939
One that can drain the sea...

48:13.106 --> 48:16.109
from outer space, David.

48:16.276 --> 48:20.530
Okay, well, if you say
they're aliens, then...

48:20.697 --> 48:23.241
I guess they're aliens.

48:26.202 --> 48:29.330
You know, I've never seen you
interested in anything

48:29.539 --> 48:33.418
that wasn't buried underground
for the last 50,000 years.

48:33.585 --> 48:36.754
You've brushed off my advances
for so long now.

48:36.921 --> 48:39.132
You've made advances?

48:39.340 --> 48:43.428
[sighs] I mean, a man can only
get shot down so many times

48:43.595 --> 48:46.264
before he gives up.

48:46.472 --> 48:48.683
David, I'm so sorry
for not noticing.

48:48.850 --> 48:53.062
I wanted to discover
something important first.

48:53.271 --> 48:55.565
Maybe we can discover
something together.

48:58.693 --> 49:02.530
You, uh, know what
they want us to do now, right?

49:03.698 --> 49:05.325
What the hell.

49:05.491 --> 49:08.077
Maybe we will procreate
after all.

49:14.417 --> 49:16.044
[rings clack]

49:42.737 --> 49:45.281
[India] So, these are
a bunch of heavy minerals

49:45.448 --> 49:47.700
that have settled to the bottom
over the years.

49:47.867 --> 49:49.494
It's perfectly normal.

49:49.702 --> 49:51.579
[Mia]
There's something inside.

49:51.746 --> 49:53.331
[India]
I highly doubt it.

49:53.498 --> 49:56.292
But if there is,
I'm certain they're dead.

49:56.459 --> 49:58.461
[Mia]
That's what I'm afraid of.

50:03.424 --> 50:05.301
[Magnum]
Mia. Mia!

50:43.297 --> 50:44.841
It's the same sign
from up top.

50:45.007 --> 50:47.343
Except I've never heard
of a department designating

50:47.510 --> 50:50.096
- an underwater site.
- Hmm.

50:50.304 --> 50:53.474
Our archeological dig site
is the Dead Sea site.

50:53.641 --> 50:55.852
This is just the Dead site.

50:57.353 --> 51:00.565
Maybe an intern
left a word off?

51:06.863 --> 51:08.865
[rocks clattering]

51:19.542 --> 51:21.919
[India] "On the third day
Christ rose again."

51:22.086 --> 51:27.467
Book of Luke,
chapter 24, verse 46.

51:27.633 --> 51:29.719
That's a quote
from the Christian bible.

51:29.886 --> 51:32.263
- But why is it here?
- [David] A cult?

51:32.472 --> 51:34.432
A secret attraction
for scuba divers.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.934
I don't know.
This could mean anything.

51:45.610 --> 51:47.779
There's a passageway here.

51:54.994 --> 51:56.829
[Mia] I don't know
how to gain entrance.

51:57.038 --> 51:59.665
[Major Lee] Only the dead
can open it, Mia.

51:59.874 --> 52:01.292
Yes, Father.

52:01.501 --> 52:03.628
Only the dead can open it.

52:42.959 --> 52:44.877
[slams shut]

52:45.044 --> 52:46.587
[India]
Oh, shit!

52:46.754 --> 52:48.548
[David]
Great. We're trapped.

52:57.515 --> 52:59.350
[David]
Feels like a coffin in here.

52:59.517 --> 53:01.894
[Mia] They emerge
from coffins and crypts.

53:02.061 --> 53:05.690
Sarcophagi and mausoleums.

53:05.857 --> 53:09.277
They suffer for millennia
in cramped spaces,

53:09.443 --> 53:11.571
waiting to rise again.

53:11.737 --> 53:13.823
Just like their savior.

53:13.990 --> 53:15.575
Their savior?

53:15.741 --> 53:17.493
[Mia]
The man you call Jesus.

53:23.457 --> 53:26.586
This is the most incredible
archeological discovery

53:26.752 --> 53:28.880
in the history of the world.

53:29.046 --> 53:30.798
Why are we whispering?

53:32.633 --> 53:33.843
[India] I don't know
what else is down here,

53:34.010 --> 53:35.970
but, if anything,

53:36.137 --> 53:40.433
I don't want to become a part
of this skull collection. Ugh.

53:45.938 --> 53:48.858
Site?

53:49.025 --> 53:51.027
It's not a word,
it's what you call a...

53:51.235 --> 53:53.321
an acronym.

53:53.487 --> 53:56.616
"The dead shall inherit
the Earth."

54:08.085 --> 54:12.131
[man] He rose from
the dead to save us!

54:13.799 --> 54:17.762
Soon we will rise up

54:17.970 --> 54:19.931
to eat their bodies...

54:20.139 --> 54:22.934
and drink their blood.

54:23.100 --> 54:27.939
It will give us
everlasting life.

54:33.694 --> 54:36.781
- [priest laughing]
- Let's get the fuck outta here!

54:38.908 --> 54:39.992
[laughing]

54:40.159 --> 54:43.079
[zombies wheezing, moaning]

54:43.245 --> 54:44.664
[laughing]

54:44.830 --> 54:46.916
Aaaah!

54:47.083 --> 54:49.669
[growling, moaning]

54:49.835 --> 54:51.545
[growling]

54:57.885 --> 55:00.930
Arrgh! Aarrgh...

55:01.097 --> 55:03.808
[Mia screaming]

55:08.604 --> 55:09.730
Aah!

55:11.107 --> 55:12.108
Run!

55:18.864 --> 55:21.951
[zombie growling]

55:23.202 --> 55:25.997
[whimpering]
My father.

55:26.163 --> 55:28.457
Father, I need your help.
I need your help now.

55:28.666 --> 55:30.418
[Major Lee]
Leave me. I belong.

55:30.584 --> 55:31.752
No!

55:31.919 --> 55:34.505
[Major Lee]
I love you.

55:34.672 --> 55:35.881
I love you too.

56:12.168 --> 56:13.711
[Thora] The Zeds here
don't move as fast.

56:13.878 --> 56:15.629
We have an advantage.

56:15.838 --> 56:18.466
Oh, shit!
We fucking did this.

56:18.632 --> 56:21.719
He Who Watches got tired
of watching us ruin his world.

56:21.886 --> 56:24.764
He drove humans off of Rathe,
and now Earth.

56:24.972 --> 56:27.099
And likely every other world
he's ever created.

56:27.266 --> 56:29.143
[Magnum]
Girls, let's go. Let's go.

56:31.312 --> 56:35.566
[moaning, growling]

56:45.117 --> 56:47.078
[woman]
Why do your people hate you?

56:47.244 --> 56:49.955
[Karl]
They're not my people.

56:50.122 --> 56:52.792
On my planet, Rathe,
we had two tribes.

56:52.958 --> 56:56.170
The Epilates, and my tribe.

56:56.337 --> 56:59.799
We were at war with one another
for resources,

57:00.007 --> 57:03.636
and our differences
and beliefs of our creator.

57:03.803 --> 57:06.222
At one point,
there was peace,

57:06.388 --> 57:09.100
but someone broke the truce.

57:09.266 --> 57:11.477
No one really knows
who started it.

57:11.644 --> 57:15.606
But on the first night
of the attack,

57:15.773 --> 57:18.109
I lost my mother...

57:18.275 --> 57:20.611
my father...

57:20.778 --> 57:22.113
four sisters,

57:22.279 --> 57:24.740
a twin brother,

57:24.907 --> 57:26.325
and most of my friends.

57:27.701 --> 57:29.245
What happened?

57:29.411 --> 57:33.624
They were murdered
in their sleep.

57:33.791 --> 57:35.626
I managed to survive,

57:35.835 --> 57:39.130
but then the dead arose
to consume us all.

57:42.174 --> 57:44.927
I only survived for one reason.

57:45.094 --> 57:47.012
And what reason was that?

57:48.347 --> 57:49.974
Revenge.

57:54.019 --> 57:57.731
[Shira, moaning]
Harder. Harder!

57:59.191 --> 58:00.609
Oh, yeah.

58:00.776 --> 58:02.945
Karl will be back
any second.

58:03.112 --> 58:04.864
Okay. Yeah, I'm trying.

58:05.072 --> 58:06.824
Harder!

58:09.994 --> 58:12.580
[Karl, in distance]
We gotta go!

58:12.746 --> 58:14.582
- Oh, is that him?
- Yeah.

58:14.748 --> 58:17.001
Pathetic choices
around here.

58:17.168 --> 58:19.211
Except for that Magnum.

58:19.378 --> 58:21.172
- [zombie roars]
- [flesh tears]

58:21.338 --> 58:23.632
[Shira]
Was that good?

58:23.799 --> 58:25.759
[groaning]

58:33.809 --> 58:35.227
[sighs]

58:46.238 --> 58:47.948
[gurgling]

58:59.835 --> 59:02.630
Hell, yeah.
Now we're talkin'.

59:03.923 --> 59:06.175
[panting]
Yeah.

59:06.342 --> 59:08.010
I'm gonna fuck you
six feet to hell.

59:08.177 --> 59:09.637
[gurgling, rasping]

59:09.803 --> 59:12.014
[moaning]

59:12.181 --> 59:14.725
- We gotta go.
- No! Let me finish!

59:14.934 --> 59:16.060
Come on!

59:16.227 --> 59:18.145
Let go of me,
you interstellar cunt!

59:20.481 --> 59:22.233
[Shira grunting, yelling]

59:22.399 --> 59:23.943
You just fucked a Zed?

59:24.109 --> 59:25.945
Is there no limit
to your sluttiness?

59:26.111 --> 59:27.238
No.

59:27.404 --> 59:29.114
Come on, we gotta go.

59:30.324 --> 59:32.660
[whooshing]

59:32.868 --> 59:36.121
[Mia]
Just as on Rathe.

59:36.288 --> 59:39.708
A new war between Earth's
inhabitants has begun.

59:39.875 --> 59:42.836
A war founded on religious
differences,

59:43.003 --> 59:44.255
greed,

59:44.421 --> 59:46.799
and a struggle for power.

59:46.966 --> 59:50.094
A war that is only a prelude
to the true devastation

59:50.302 --> 59:52.221
that is about to sweep
this doomed world.

59:52.388 --> 59:54.265
[explosion]

01:00:03.941 --> 01:00:05.859
- [Magnum] Hey.
- [all panting]

01:00:08.279 --> 01:00:10.364
A war has begun.

01:00:10.531 --> 01:00:12.700
- We have to get to the city.
- Why? What's in the city?

01:00:12.866 --> 01:00:14.910
A great evil is about
to be unleashed.

01:00:15.077 --> 01:00:16.996
We have to go now.

01:00:19.873 --> 01:00:22.835
Ah. Well, would you
look at that?

01:00:23.002 --> 01:00:26.839
Thy kingdom come...
never.

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:51.822
[India] So, Thora,
what was your world like?

01:00:51.989 --> 01:00:53.198
You know, before.

01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:55.409
[Thora]
Rathe? Sorta like this.

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:57.453
Dry and dusty.

01:00:57.619 --> 01:01:00.456
My father did say that before
the wars it was a paradise.

01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:02.207
[India]
So you had wars too?

01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:04.084
[Thora] The Ariels
and the Nepilates,

01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:07.129
they fought over everything...
land, water, holy grounds.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.839
I remember when I was younger,

01:01:09.006 --> 01:01:10.758
the children of each tribe
would get together,

01:01:10.966 --> 01:01:12.301
of course,
without the adults,

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.428
and they created
a Children's Peace Treaty

01:01:14.595 --> 01:01:16.805
in which we decided to share.

01:01:16.972 --> 01:01:19.808
[India] Yes, let the children
negotiate peace.

01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:21.226
I mean,
they're the only ones left

01:01:21.393 --> 01:01:22.895
that are not blinded by hatred.

01:01:23.103 --> 01:01:24.521
[Thora] Well, the adults
laughed at us

01:01:24.688 --> 01:01:26.273
and burned the treaty.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.068
And the fighting
intensified after that.

01:01:29.234 --> 01:01:30.944
[soldiers shouting]

01:01:32.154 --> 01:01:33.405
[gasping]

01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:41.330
[India] Guns.

01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:49.046
Come on, guys, they got it.

01:01:58.472 --> 01:02:01.183
[zombies howling]

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.204
[Mia]
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:23.539
What is it, Mia?

01:02:23.705 --> 01:02:25.249
We must get
to the Prayer Wall.

01:02:25.416 --> 01:02:28.836
A great evil
is about to be unleashed.

01:02:29.002 --> 01:02:32.089
[zombies moaning]

01:02:32.256 --> 01:02:33.841
We must hurry.

01:02:36.093 --> 01:02:37.219
Crazy, isn't it?

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:40.055
The religious people
were right.

01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:42.015
Death isn't the end after all.

01:02:42.182 --> 01:02:45.227
But this probably
wasn't what they meant.

01:02:45.436 --> 01:02:48.230
I mean, I'm just curious
if when the humans are gone,

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:50.899
you think the zombies will
make horror movies about us?

01:02:51.066 --> 01:02:52.526
[India laughs]

01:02:52.693 --> 01:02:55.028
I guess we'll either
live or die together.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:57.489
I'm good with that.

01:02:57.656 --> 01:03:00.325
I'm sorry I got you involved
in this, Dr. Coleman.

01:03:00.492 --> 01:03:01.910
It's okay. You know,

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:03.954
India Jones
and the Temple of Death

01:03:04.121 --> 01:03:05.956
is quite exciting.

01:03:06.123 --> 01:03:09.918
But in case
there's not a second date...

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.630
Guys! Zombies.

01:03:16.675 --> 01:03:17.593
Shit.

01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:19.011
[all]
Mashante.

01:03:21.555 --> 01:03:23.015
Let's fuck up some Zeds!

01:03:23.182 --> 01:03:25.058
- Let's ride!
- Let's do this.

01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:26.143
It's go time.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:27.311
You ready?

01:03:27.478 --> 01:03:29.146
[chambers round]
Born ready.

01:03:29.313 --> 01:03:30.981
[zombies growling]

01:03:31.148 --> 01:03:32.399
[war cries]

01:03:34.276 --> 01:03:36.528
Noa, stay close.

01:04:02.804 --> 01:04:04.181
Come on, Noa.

01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:16.610
Mia, show us the way.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:23.116
The Prayer Wall.
Through here.

01:04:30.707 --> 01:04:32.960
Where do you rank
compared to the others?

01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:35.087
Why?

01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:36.964
I want to know
who's in charge.

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.007
They can't boss me around
anymore.

01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:40.425
So they were your bosses?

01:04:40.592 --> 01:04:42.135
I could take
any one of those guys.

01:04:42.302 --> 01:04:45.347
[scoffs] I doubt you could
even take the girls.

01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:51.728
Why, you motherfucker!

01:04:54.231 --> 01:04:56.525
We're. Wasting. Time.

01:04:59.861 --> 01:05:02.197
[zombies roaring, howling]

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.414
[roaring]

01:05:24.136 --> 01:05:26.138
[Noa shrieking]

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.195
[zombies moaning]

01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:50.120
Once you've had dead dick,

01:05:50.287 --> 01:05:53.165
you'll never do the trick.

01:05:53.332 --> 01:05:57.127
[woman laughing]
Dead dick. It's always hard.

01:05:57.336 --> 01:05:58.420
I know, right?

01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:09.431
[laughing hysterically]

01:06:13.477 --> 01:06:17.189
- [laughing continues]
- [zombies moaning]

01:06:23.403 --> 01:06:25.697
Whoa.
Something's not right here.

01:06:25.864 --> 01:06:27.449
[Beset]
We need to keep moving.

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:28.825
[Mia] The Prayer Wall.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.762
Smart Zeds?

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.098
We're not doomed
as long as we stay together.

01:06:51.264 --> 01:06:53.642
- Round three?
- Woman...

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.602
I'm gonna mate with you
so hard after this.

01:06:55.769 --> 01:06:56.853
I'll leave the blood on for ya.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.314
'[War cry]
- [gunshots]

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:14.788
Creator!

01:07:14.955 --> 01:07:18.125
Why did you bother to make us?!

01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:20.377
You had to know
we'd be fucked up!

01:07:28.885 --> 01:07:30.470
Take your clothes off.

01:07:30.637 --> 01:07:32.597
A one-track mind?

01:07:44.776 --> 01:07:46.528
[Squishy sounds]

01:07:46.737 --> 01:07:48.530
Oh, fuck me!

01:07:48.739 --> 01:07:50.240
Not now. Later.

01:07:50.407 --> 01:07:51.825
Not that kind of fuck me.

01:07:53.368 --> 01:07:54.911
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:08:03.837 --> 01:08:06.590
[sobbing]

01:08:08.508 --> 01:08:10.886
Do you want to live
or not...

01:08:11.052 --> 01:08:12.596
with the alpha male?

01:08:12.804 --> 01:08:14.681
You'll be the king?

01:08:39.372 --> 01:08:42.209
[zombies moaning]

01:08:56.973 --> 01:08:59.518
You are He Who Watches,
aren't you?

01:08:59.684 --> 01:09:02.562
On Earth, that is my name.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:05.232
You sacrificed yourself
to save mankind

01:09:05.398 --> 01:09:06.733
from eternal death.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.652
Why?

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:11.279
My father asked me to.

01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:22.791
- [Phoenix groaning]
- [Beset] Phoenix!

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:25.460
Phoenix! [sobbing]

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:26.711
Karl!

01:09:26.877 --> 01:09:28.630
And you thought
I was stupid.

01:09:28.839 --> 01:09:32.843
When you and the others
are dead, I'll still be here.

01:09:33.009 --> 01:09:36.388
Owner of this land
and king of the dead.

01:09:36.555 --> 01:09:37.930
And queen of the dead.

01:09:38.098 --> 01:09:41.017
[Shira laughing]

01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:43.562
Beset...

01:09:43.728 --> 01:09:46.773
I can't roam alone
on this planet forever.

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:48.692
You won't.

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:52.362
We'll be together.
Like we promised.

01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:01.329
Beset, what are you doing?

01:10:01.538 --> 01:10:02.914
[heavy breathing]

01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:05.542
- Let's resurrect.
- What?

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.426
- [Beset grunts]
- [Phoenix] No!

01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:16.720
[growling]

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:51.296
- [growling]
- [Shira grunts]

01:10:51.504 --> 01:10:53.757
Get this waste of flesh
off my altar.

01:10:53.924 --> 01:10:55.342
You don't talk to me
like that, little girl.

01:10:55.508 --> 01:10:58.345
Karl, do what the fuck I say!

01:11:27.624 --> 01:11:30.794
My father once asked me
to save him.

01:11:30.961 --> 01:11:33.129
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

01:11:35.006 --> 01:11:35.924
Until now.

01:11:39.803 --> 01:11:41.680
[Shira] Nostrus stella.

01:11:41.846 --> 01:11:43.014
[Karl] Nostrus stella.

01:11:43.181 --> 01:11:44.057
[Shira] Benede canos.

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:46.434
[Karl] Benede canos.

01:11:46.601 --> 01:11:48.603
[Shira] We summon thee
on this night.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:49.854
[Karl] We summon thee
on this night.

01:11:50.021 --> 01:11:52.399
To give
a sacrifice of blood.

01:11:52.565 --> 01:11:53.984
[Karl] To give
a sacrifice of blood.

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:55.402
- For thy light.
- For thy light.

01:11:55.568 --> 01:11:57.904
[Shira] Nostrus stella.
Benede Canos.

01:11:58.071 --> 01:12:00.321
[Karl] Nostrus stella.
Benede Canos.

01:12:00.323 --> 01:12:01.616
[Shira] We summon thee
on this night.

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:02.993
[Karl] We summon thee
on this night.

01:12:03.201 --> 01:12:04.995
To give a sacrifice of blood.

01:12:05.203 --> 01:12:06.621
[Karl] To give
a sacrifice of blood.

01:12:06.788 --> 01:12:07.998
- For thy light.
- For thy light.

01:12:20.802 --> 01:12:22.595
[screaming]

01:12:26.307 --> 01:12:29.519
I failed.
I can't do anything now.

01:12:29.686 --> 01:12:32.022
I tell you the truth.

01:12:32.188 --> 01:12:33.773
Before Abraham.

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:34.816
[heavy breathing]

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.776
I remember father.

01:12:36.943 --> 01:12:40.155
Before Abraham was born. I am.

01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:42.115
As you say it, it is so.

01:12:51.291 --> 01:12:52.876
[laughing]

01:13:06.848 --> 01:13:09.476
Save my children.

01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:11.102
If not, I died in vain.

01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.152
You saved mankind,

01:13:19.319 --> 01:13:20.862
and so can I.

01:13:26.076 --> 01:13:26.993
Karl!

01:14:18.336 --> 01:14:20.213
[heavy breathing, coughing]

01:14:23.967 --> 01:14:25.301
- What did you do?
- [stammering]

01:14:27.137 --> 01:14:28.179
Fuck!

01:14:31.683 --> 01:14:33.226
Oh Mia. Mia, no.

01:14:36.354 --> 01:14:38.064
Oh no. No, no.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:41.860
It is done.

01:14:43.236 --> 01:14:44.320
Oh, sister.

01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:54.998
Karl... Karl...

01:14:55.206 --> 01:14:56.040
[screaming]

01:14:56.207 --> 01:14:57.750
Oh shit!

01:14:57.917 --> 01:14:59.544
Kill me, stud!

01:14:59.711 --> 01:15:01.129
Fuck me to death!

01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:12.932
You killed my father

01:15:13.099 --> 01:15:15.185
and you killed
my precious sister.

01:15:15.351 --> 01:15:17.854
I'm gonna kill you
with my bare fucking hands.

01:15:18.021 --> 01:15:20.648
And my wife here,
is gonna kill your bitch.

01:15:20.815 --> 01:15:21.858
You can try.

01:15:25.069 --> 01:15:27.363
You Ratheans
are all fucking cowards.

01:15:27.572 --> 01:15:31.117
Why don't you drop your weapons
and fight me like a real woman?

01:15:31.284 --> 01:15:32.202
Or are you even a real woman?

01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:57.352
I'm gonna fuck you

01:15:57.518 --> 01:15:59.729
and then I'm gonna kill you.

01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:02.357
Then I'm gonna
fuck your boyfriend

01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:05.193
and then I'm gonna
kill him too.

01:16:05.401 --> 01:16:07.028
And out of those options...

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.906
[screaming]

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:16.204
The only one I would allow

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.789
is the first one.

01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:33.304
- [gurgles]
- [sighs]

01:16:36.975 --> 01:16:37.892
[Spits]

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:48.987
[Mia] The evil was impeded.

01:16:49.153 --> 01:16:51.030
But a new battle has begun.

01:16:58.871 --> 01:17:01.958
Help them. Watch them.

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:04.168
And if you must, punish them.

01:17:05.461 --> 01:17:06.421
And if I don't?

01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:08.965
My father will.

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:13.428
In your name,
He Who Watches.

01:17:13.594 --> 01:17:16.431
And in your name,
She Who Watches.

01:17:20.059 --> 01:17:23.396
[Mia] Earth has become
a world of decay and wickedness.

01:17:23.563 --> 01:17:25.106
The sinful sweep the land,

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:27.817
drawing innocent blood
to feed their selfish needs.

01:17:27.984 --> 01:17:29.861
Where is it?

01:17:30.028 --> 01:17:31.779
Where is it, bitch?
[stammering]

01:18:06.105 --> 01:18:07.899
No. Please.

01:18:11.069 --> 01:18:13.112
Please, please.

01:18:13.279 --> 01:18:15.073
I'm sorry. Please.

01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:16.199
I'm sorry.

01:18:16.407 --> 01:18:18.368
Please. Please!

01:18:18.534 --> 01:18:20.244
I'm sorry! Please!

01:18:20.411 --> 01:18:23.331
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:27.418
Whatsoever a man soweth,

01:18:27.585 --> 01:18:30.213
that shall also reap.

01:18:45.937 --> 01:18:48.856
[Mia] Humanity struggles
to do better.

01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.983
For those who don't,

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:52.860
punish them.

01:18:53.069 --> 01:18:55.822
My faithful Zed Watchers
now patrol the lands.

01:18:59.575 --> 01:19:01.160
I know, Father.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.913
It's possible that the dead
shall inherit the Earth.

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.917
But not if I have anything
to do with it.
