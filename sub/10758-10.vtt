00:08.565 --> 00:11.025
I thought your father was in charge
of Christmas decorations.

00:11.234 --> 00:13.987
Oh, no, no, not this year.
We're doing it my way.

00:14.195 --> 00:16.239
That's why I'm ordering
a tasteful tree here.

00:16.406 --> 00:18.700
They'll even deliver it
on Christmas Eve fully decorated.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.619
- Gee, that'll be fun for Freddie.
- Frederick won't be joining me.

00:21.828 --> 00:24.664
He's spending his vacation
on an archaeological tour with Lilith.

00:24.872 --> 00:27.417
He's spending Christmas
with dried-up old bones?

00:27.625 --> 00:29.001
Yes, I thought I told you.

00:29.252 --> 00:31.712
She's taking him
on an archaeological tour.

00:33.089 --> 00:34.882
Oh, good Lord,
look how late it's gotten.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.133
Well, don't blame me.

00:36.342 --> 00:40.012
You're the one who spent 20 minutes
looking for that candleholder thing.

00:40.263 --> 00:41.722
No, no, no. It's a menorah, Roz.

00:41.889 --> 00:43.766
Thought I'd get one
for Frederick for Hanukkah.

00:43.975 --> 00:46.978
Oh, that's right. I completely forgot
Frederick is half Jewish.

00:47.186 --> 00:49.563
Yes, between the Crane boy genes
and Lilith's contribution,

00:49.730 --> 00:52.316
I'm not sure the NFL
is holding its breath.

00:52.566 --> 00:55.236
I need to go over to Notions
and try to find something for Calvin,

00:55.403 --> 00:57.363
- the security guard.
- What are you getting him?

00:57.571 --> 01:00.324
If I knew,
I wouldn't be going to Notions.

01:00.825 --> 01:03.828
Excuse me. I'd like to get a gift
for that woman I was with.

01:03.994 --> 01:06.247
- How about this sweater right here?
- Excellent choice.

01:06.497 --> 01:10.459
I'm not sure of the size. Could you
find me this in a medium? Thank you.

01:10.709 --> 01:13.003
- It's a madhouse in there.
- Roz!

01:13.254 --> 01:15.214
People pushing and shoving
for nose-hair clippers.

01:15.422 --> 01:18.092
Is there a nasal hair epidemic
I don't know about?

01:18.342 --> 01:20.302
Here's your sweater.

01:20.511 --> 01:23.681
- Is he talking to you?
- No, no, no, he's talking to...

01:23.889 --> 01:26.350
He's talking to me. It's for my niece.

01:26.558 --> 01:29.228
But I'm a bit worried about the size.

01:29.395 --> 01:31.021
You know,
she's just about your height.

01:31.188 --> 01:33.607
Do you mind my asking,
would this fit you?

01:33.857 --> 01:35.651
That's a little big for me.

01:35.859 --> 01:38.862
- What about the colour? A little blah?
- Personally, I like the blue.

01:39.363 --> 01:41.573
I agree. Thank you so much.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.452
I will take a smaller size in the blue,
and please gift-wrap it.

01:45.702 --> 01:49.206
- Coming right up.
- It looks like Notions has thinned out.

01:49.373 --> 01:52.042
Oh, good. So you think Calvin
will like the nose hair clippers?

01:52.292 --> 01:54.336
I think we can be sure
he doesn't own a pair.

01:55.921 --> 01:58.298
Gosh, thank you so much
for bailing me out that way.

01:58.465 --> 02:00.259
My pleasure. Helen.

02:00.467 --> 02:03.637
- Helen? Frasier.
- Not Frasier Crane?

02:03.845 --> 02:04.972
- From the radio show?
- Yes.

02:06.139 --> 02:09.393
I listen to you every time I come
to Seattle to visit my daughter Faye.

02:09.643 --> 02:10.894
Well, that's very kind.

02:11.144 --> 02:13.188
You know, you really
should know your wife's size.

02:13.355 --> 02:16.858
- Oh, she's not my wife.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.527
- It's all right.
- Girlfriend?

02:18.777 --> 02:22.030
No, I don't have a girlfriend, actually.
I'm unattached.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.700
Well, I've taken enough of your time.

02:25.909 --> 02:28.912
Although, there is one small thing
you could help me with.

02:29.079 --> 02:30.705
I'm looking for something
for my daughter.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.207
Oh, what is it?

02:32.457 --> 02:35.543
- No, I really shouldn't ask you.
- No, no, please.

02:35.794 --> 02:37.420
No, no, it's too much
of an imposition.

02:37.587 --> 02:40.340
No, no, the way you came to my
rescue, I'd be delighted to help you.

02:40.548 --> 02:42.592
What is it you're looking
to get for your daughter?

02:42.759 --> 02:46.096
A date with a nice
unattached doctor.

02:47.806 --> 02:50.975
Well, I certainly walked
into that one, didn't I?

02:51.476 --> 02:53.937
It wasn't my first time.

02:57.607 --> 02:58.900
As soon as this woman gets here,

02:59.109 --> 03:01.152
give me five minutes
and call me on my cell phone.

03:01.361 --> 03:04.364
If I am miserable, I will simply say
it's an emergency and excuse myself.

03:04.614 --> 03:06.574
Yes, the ever-valuable escape call.

03:06.783 --> 03:08.493
Oh, you've done them?

03:09.244 --> 03:10.703
No, but I've seen them done.

03:14.374 --> 03:15.917
Excuse me, are you Frasier?

03:16.960 --> 03:22.382
Faye? Yes, well, hello.
How did you know it was me?

03:22.632 --> 03:26.219
You had that horror-stricken look
of someone who's met my mother.

03:26.469 --> 03:28.096
No, please, please. Shall we?

03:28.262 --> 03:30.807
That's sweet of you, but you
don't have to go through with this.

03:31.015 --> 03:32.016
I just came to apologise.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.143
No, please.
Please, why don't you sit down?

03:34.352 --> 03:36.729
Hey, Dr. Crane.
Are you here with your brother?

03:36.896 --> 03:38.523
No, actually, he's on a blind date.

03:41.359 --> 03:46.948
Oh, he is, isn't he? Oh, look at him.
I think he really fancies her.

03:47.156 --> 03:50.826
You know, it's always so obvious
when a man likes a woman.

03:50.993 --> 03:54.497
You can just tell
by his awkward body language.

03:54.705 --> 03:56.666
Shifting in his chair,

03:56.874 --> 04:00.044
he doesn't know quite
what to do with his hands.

04:00.753 --> 04:02.963
He's as nervous as a hen.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.925
Oh, for God's sakes, stop fidgeting!

04:07.301 --> 04:09.095
So your mother tells me
that you're a lawyer.

04:09.345 --> 04:10.429
Well, that's typical.

04:10.596 --> 04:13.849
I was a lawyer and I quit two years ago
and now I'm a pastry chef.

04:14.225 --> 04:15.226
- Really?
- Yes.

04:15.434 --> 04:16.894
I work in a French restaurant
in town.

04:17.101 --> 04:18.813
Maybe you've heard of it.
Le Cigare Volant?

04:19.021 --> 04:21.398
It's one of my favourites.
I had dinner there last Friday.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.192
I worked Friday. What did you have?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.110
- The Grand Marnier soufflÃ©.
- I made that!

04:25.277 --> 04:27.488
- Well, it was poetry on a plate.
- Thank you.

04:28.072 --> 04:30.199
You didn't happen to find
my earring in it, did you?

04:32.368 --> 04:34.161
I'm kidding.

04:35.329 --> 04:39.375
You know, suddenly I'm glad that
your mother is as pushy as she is.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.794
It's funny, though,
you're nothing like her.

04:42.002 --> 04:44.755
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

04:44.963 --> 04:47.091
Dr. Crane, can I ask a favour?

04:47.257 --> 04:49.134
What are you doing
for the next ten nights?

04:49.343 --> 04:51.220
- Because my...
- Yes.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.807
Excuse me, finish the question.

04:55.015 --> 04:58.435
Well, my neighbourhood theatre group
is putting on a holiday revue.

04:58.644 --> 05:01.188
We're performing in the common room
of Dr. Crane's building.

05:01.438 --> 05:03.065
- Right downstairs?
- Yeah.

05:03.273 --> 05:06.109
Well, we're still looking
for a musical director.

05:06.276 --> 05:09.613
I would never ask you, but they
put me in charge of the whole thing.

05:09.821 --> 05:11.615
Oh, well, count me in.

05:11.823 --> 05:13.617
Is the show more religious
in tone or secular?

05:13.825 --> 05:17.579
Well, we couldn't quite agree,
so we ended up with a mixed bag.

05:18.246 --> 05:20.123
We open with
the no-room-at-the-inn scene,

05:20.332 --> 05:22.376
then it's a rousing version
of "Jingle Bell Rock,"

05:22.542 --> 05:24.920
<i>a brief medley
from Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

05:25.170 --> 05:29.090
The first act ends with Santa's elves
and the Three Wise Men linking arms

05:29.299 --> 05:31.843
and singing "Frosty the Snowman."

05:33.345 --> 05:36.264
Well. Excuse me,
I have to make a phone call.

05:36.473 --> 05:41.102
Of course, I love Boston,
but, well, there's no place like home.

05:41.978 --> 05:43.855
Excuse me.

05:45.523 --> 05:47.400
Yes, hello?

05:48.485 --> 05:51.571
Yes, no, you know what?
I'll just have to sign those papers later.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.406
Thank you.

05:54.783 --> 05:55.784
Office work.

05:56.034 --> 05:58.703
That was an escape call, wasn't it?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.706
No, what are you talking about?

06:01.873 --> 06:04.709
Come on, it's a blind date.
You wanted a way to back out.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.713
Oh, gosh, you are sharp, aren't you?
How did you know?

06:15.261 --> 06:18.264
Well, that would be just lovely.
All right, I'll see you soon.

06:20.141 --> 06:23.144
Well, isn't that nice?
Faye's dropping by.

06:23.353 --> 06:25.396
You've been seeing a lot of her lately,
haven't you?

06:25.605 --> 06:27.732
Yes, I have. You know,
she really is quite wonderful.

06:28.274 --> 06:30.151
Thought she was off
to Florida with her mother.

06:30.318 --> 06:32.278
Yes. They're popping by
on the way to the airport.

06:32.487 --> 06:37.992
I guess someone wanted to rack up
a few more frequent Frasier miles.

06:41.496 --> 06:43.956
You don't ever actually say
those things to the woman, do you?

06:44.165 --> 06:45.875
Oh, no, no, no.

06:48.461 --> 06:51.547
- Oh, good, Dr. Crane, you're here.
- Yes, the show starts in half an hour.

06:51.756 --> 06:52.757
Could you give me a hand?

06:52.965 --> 06:56.219
I still have to sew the chains to Jacob
Marley's tux for the dance number.

06:56.427 --> 06:58.387
- Oh, happy to.
- Jacob Marley?

06:58.596 --> 07:00.139
<i>They're doing
A Christmas Carol too?</i>

07:00.389 --> 07:03.559
No, they're not. They worked him
into the nativity scene.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.773
Hey, Fras, where's a good spot
for Rudolph this year?

07:08.981 --> 07:13.194
Dad, please, I thought we had
an agreement about the decorations.

07:13.402 --> 07:15.362
I know, but what's Christmas
without Rudolph?

07:15.571 --> 07:17.364
He is not even one
of the original reindeer.

07:17.573 --> 07:18.699
Do the others have a song?

07:18.949 --> 07:20.493
I'm not having
this discussion again!

07:20.701 --> 07:22.411
Because you know I'm right.
Forget it.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.873
I wouldn't want to ruin
your designer Christmas.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.044
- Oh, Faye!
- Hi.

07:30.211 --> 07:33.464
Hi. Good to see you.
Here, let me take your coat.

07:33.672 --> 07:35.382
- Thank you.
- Where's Helen?

07:35.591 --> 07:36.759
She's talking to your doorman.

07:36.967 --> 07:38.844
She's trying to fix him up
with my cousin Janet

07:39.053 --> 07:41.096
and I couldn't bear to watch.

07:41.263 --> 07:43.307
Oh, I'll just leave that ajar
for her there.

07:43.474 --> 07:45.434
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

07:45.642 --> 07:48.187
- You have a wreath.
- Yes, so?

07:48.437 --> 07:52.566
- Aren't you Jewish?
- No. No, why do you ask?

07:52.775 --> 07:56.111
The day we met, my mother
saw you shopping for a menorah.

07:56.361 --> 07:59.114
Yes, for my son.
My ex-wife is Jewish.

07:59.323 --> 08:02.576
- Oh, God.
- Is there a problem?

08:02.784 --> 08:05.454
For me, no,
but my mother is another story.

08:05.662 --> 08:09.333
Here I was wondering what we'd talk
about on a seven-hour flight to Miami.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.251
You know what,
I can just take this down.

08:11.418 --> 08:13.795
No, no, no, I have to stop
being a child about these things.

08:14.004 --> 08:15.213
If she's upset, she's upset.

08:15.464 --> 08:17.007
- How many stopovers do you have?
- Two.

08:17.215 --> 08:19.259
- I'll take it down.
- Thank you.

08:19.468 --> 08:22.387
- I really appreciate you doing this.
- Oh, it's no problem.

08:22.637 --> 08:26.058
Can't believe I'm asking you to pretend
to be Jewish on Christmas Eve.

08:26.224 --> 08:29.561
It's all right, really.
It probably won't even come up.

08:29.770 --> 08:30.854
- Hello?
- Oh, there she is.

08:31.021 --> 08:34.524
- Hello, Frasier.
- Helen! Hi.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.568
Oh, what a beautiful apartment
you have.

08:37.736 --> 08:39.946
Thank you very much.

08:40.238 --> 08:42.198
Get out!

08:43.366 --> 08:46.620
- What?
- Of that coat already.

08:53.585 --> 08:57.797
- So, Frasier, you grew up in Seattle?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.216
- Such a pretty city.
- Yes.

09:00.467 --> 09:01.926
I guess you were bar mitzvahed here.

09:02.177 --> 09:03.887
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

09:05.555 --> 09:08.475
What a proud day that was.

09:08.683 --> 09:12.729
I can still remember reading
from the Torah

09:13.313 --> 09:16.983
before the rabbi

09:18.109 --> 09:20.945
and the cantor and the mohel.

09:21.154 --> 09:22.322
The mohel?

09:24.198 --> 09:26.326
The one who did your circumcision?

09:27.160 --> 09:31.956
Yes, yes, I just wanted to show him
that there were no hard feelings.

09:35.168 --> 09:38.838
- Niles!
- Hello, all. You must be Faye.

09:39.088 --> 09:40.798
And I'm her mother,
Helen Moskowitz.

09:41.049 --> 09:43.009
- And I'm Frasier's brother, Niles.
- Yes.

09:43.259 --> 09:44.260
What happened to the...?

09:44.469 --> 09:46.345
Moskowitz that lived down the hall?
They moved.

09:46.512 --> 09:48.055
Why don't you help me
in the kitchen?

09:48.222 --> 09:49.932
I'm just about to pour
everybody a drink.

09:51.184 --> 09:52.643
What's going on?

09:52.810 --> 09:55.021
Faye's mother thinks
that we're Jewish. Just play along.

09:55.229 --> 09:58.733
Okay. Why?

09:58.900 --> 10:02.486
Well, it's important to Faye,
Faye is important to me.

10:02.695 --> 10:05.281
- You think you can pull it off?
- No problem. Oh, ham.

10:05.489 --> 10:09.535
Niles. Please.

10:09.744 --> 10:12.204
We've got to find a time
to tell Dad about this too.

10:12.413 --> 10:14.874
- You mean Papa.
- Stop it.

10:15.958 --> 10:16.959
- Wait, Frasier.
- What?

10:17.209 --> 10:18.586
- Is that for Helen?
- Yes.

10:18.836 --> 10:20.713
What if she's expecting
Jewish wine?

10:20.880 --> 10:24.049
- I'm afraid I don't have that on hand.
- That's all right. It's easy enough.

10:24.216 --> 10:26.260
It's just like regular wine,
plus a little of this.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.600
Try that.

10:33.851 --> 10:36.061
- It's dreadful.
- Perfect.

10:38.188 --> 10:42.067
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you.

10:42.276 --> 10:45.279
Who has a nice toast? Niles?

10:45.988 --> 10:47.448
Oh, all right.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.081
Next year in Jerusalem.

10:57.499 --> 10:59.918
Take it down a notch, Tevye.

11:00.419 --> 11:02.629
Hey, Fras, you know,
since it's the night before...

11:02.880 --> 11:04.840
- Dad!
- Oh, great.

11:05.048 --> 11:07.801
Would it be a crime for somebody
to tell me we had guests here?

11:08.010 --> 11:11.096
Hi, I'm Marty Crane. I'm Frasier's dad.
Although you'd never guess it

11:11.305 --> 11:14.308
from the way I'm treated like
a second-class citizen around here.

11:14.516 --> 11:18.729
But, as long as Frasier's happy,
why should my feelings matter?

11:18.937 --> 11:21.607
Niles, why don't you see
if you can go help Dad in the kitchen?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.942
Well, all right,
but he'll probably just kvetch at me

11:24.151 --> 11:26.028
- and frankly, I don't need the tsuris.
- Niles!

11:32.868 --> 11:34.035
I don't know how to be Jewish.

11:34.244 --> 11:35.704
Just answer questions
with a question.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.706
- Like what?
- I have to explain everything?

11:37.956 --> 11:40.792
- Can't you give me an example?
- What, I should give you an example?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.002
You gonna help me or not?

11:42.252 --> 11:45.005
- You're saying I'm not being helpful?
- Oh, forget it!

11:47.048 --> 11:51.678
So, Marty, both your sons are doctors.
How'd you work that out?

11:51.887 --> 11:56.182
I have no idea... do I?

11:59.519 --> 12:03.106
Well, I just got the phone call
every producer dreads.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.192
- What is it?
- Someone's dropping out of the show.

12:07.318 --> 12:09.654
You don't suppose
you could take over one of the roles?

12:09.904 --> 12:12.115
Well, I don't see why not.
I know all the songs.

12:12.323 --> 12:14.576
- Wonderful.
- Oh, it was nice meeting you both.

12:14.784 --> 12:17.454
Likewise. We're leaving too.
Could you send the elevator back up?

12:17.620 --> 12:18.997
- We'll be right down.
- Happy to.

12:19.164 --> 12:22.000
- So who dropped out?
- Mr. Blanchard.

12:23.668 --> 12:25.879
It's been great spending
some time with the two of you.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.338
I wish you could stay longer.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.300
Well, actually, we can.
I just called the airline.

12:30.466 --> 12:32.010
The plane is delayed an hour.

12:32.594 --> 12:34.387
Well, isn't that good news?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.597
You know, I hate to be forward,

12:36.806 --> 12:40.727
but I'd love to taste whatever smells
so wonderful in that kitchen.

12:40.935 --> 12:44.689
And I would love to give you a taste,
except it isn't done yet.

12:46.524 --> 12:49.527
Well, more good news!

12:52.780 --> 12:55.324
I don't know how much longer
we can continue this charade.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.202
My God, when Dad started to talk
about working on his own car,

12:58.411 --> 13:00.538
I thought we were goners.

13:00.705 --> 13:02.999
Well, we only have to keep it up
for another half an hour.

13:03.207 --> 13:05.418
Actually, I think I have an idea.

13:05.626 --> 13:07.670
- Go out there.
- Okay.

13:07.878 --> 13:09.755
Well, I don't know what it is
with that brisket.

13:09.964 --> 13:11.340
It just won't cook through.

13:11.549 --> 13:13.801
- I could take a look.
- No, no, we don't have the time.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.970
I just got off the phone
with the airlines.

13:16.178 --> 13:18.389
They pushed the flights back up.
We have to get going.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.307
Oh, really? All right.

13:20.474 --> 13:22.268
Gosh, you know,
I wish you could stay longer.

13:22.476 --> 13:25.813
It's just that I'd hate to have you
be late for your plane.

13:25.980 --> 13:29.316
- Hello, sir.
- On the other hand, you know,

13:29.525 --> 13:31.485
you can't leave
until you've seen the apartment.

13:31.694 --> 13:33.904
- What?
- All right, let's start in the bedroom.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.114
There's plenty of time.

13:35.322 --> 13:38.492
Oh, Dad, could you see who that is
and make sure they come back later?

13:38.659 --> 13:42.872
Whatever you want, Frasier,
as usual.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.377
Hello, sir. Let me wish you a merry...

13:48.627 --> 13:49.920
Bring that thing back in an hour.

13:50.129 --> 13:53.299
No way, sir. It's Christmas Eve
and I've got a full truck downstairs.

13:53.507 --> 13:55.968
- So where do you want it?
- Oh, jeez, I don't know.

13:56.176 --> 13:59.763
You know, a lot of people
put them in their living rooms.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.557
Oh, here, here,
put it in the bathroom.

14:01.724 --> 14:02.725
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah.

14:02.933 --> 14:05.310
- Okay.
- Just put it in, all right?

14:07.000 --> 14:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:19.867 --> 14:22.869
- All right, come on, quick.
- Okay.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.123
- You have, you know, a mer...
- Shut up. Get out.

14:27.416 --> 14:30.502
- That's a beautiful bedroom, Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, thank you very much.

14:30.669 --> 14:33.338
I noticed you were sort of quiet,
Faye.

14:33.547 --> 14:36.007
Almost as though
you'd been in there before, huh?

14:36.216 --> 14:39.553
Oh, yeah, I have, Ma,
but I was drunk and it was dark.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.472
I don't remember so much.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.100
You see how she talks
to her mother?

14:45.934 --> 14:47.477
Jesus!

14:50.939 --> 14:51.940
I'll tell you what.

14:52.649 --> 14:55.026
I just realised that you haven't seen
the beautiful balcony.

14:55.235 --> 14:57.821
Dad, would you do the honours
and I'll check on the brisket?

14:58.405 --> 14:59.406
What is going on?

14:59.614 --> 15:02.367
<i>The man who does the number from
Jesus Christ Superstar can't go on.</i>

15:02.534 --> 15:04.911
He slipped in the shower.
Man could walk on water, but no...

15:05.078 --> 15:06.621
Yes, it's dripping with irony.

15:07.414 --> 15:09.040
Niles, what are you doing here?

15:09.290 --> 15:12.043
The minute I got within ten feet
of the hay for the manger scene,

15:12.210 --> 15:14.713
my allergies kicked in.
I think I left my nasal spray here.

15:14.921 --> 15:17.173
I am terribly sorry,
but you've got to get out of here!

15:17.382 --> 15:20.468
- Is that kind of language appropriate?
- Oh, just shut up!

15:24.055 --> 15:26.891
Would you believe it?
It's still pink in the middle.

15:27.058 --> 15:31.688
By the time my brisket's done,
my kugel will be dry as the Sinai.

15:42.615 --> 15:47.495
It certainly is beautiful,
but now I think we're cutting it close.

15:47.704 --> 15:49.914
Yes, you know, you're quite right.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.833
We can continue the tour
at another time.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.251
Let me walk you to the door.

15:53.459 --> 15:56.712
Thank you so much, Frasier.
You're a wonderful host.

15:56.921 --> 15:57.922
Oh, well.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.300
You know, maybe I should go
to the powder room before we go.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.886
Oh, here, allow me.

16:13.354 --> 16:14.522
What is going on?

16:14.730 --> 16:17.233
Helen, I am so terribly sorry.

16:19.944 --> 16:22.363
I'll let you all sort this out.
I really have to go.

16:22.613 --> 16:25.366
I understand. This is your busy time.

16:30.621 --> 16:33.707
Ma, Frasier's not Jewish.

16:33.916 --> 16:35.960
I told them to pretend
so you wouldn't freak out.

16:36.168 --> 16:40.548
What? You think I care?
You can date anyone you want.

16:40.756 --> 16:41.757
Since when?

16:41.966 --> 16:44.093
I can't believe
you're embarrassing me like this.

16:44.343 --> 16:45.803
You embarrass me
on an hourly basis.

16:46.011 --> 16:47.555
I embarrass you?
Are you hearing this?

16:47.763 --> 16:49.890
You know, maybe we should
just give you your privacy.

16:50.099 --> 16:52.393
No one leaves. You see?

16:52.643 --> 16:55.020
You are making them uncomfortable
in their own home.

16:55.229 --> 16:56.939
You could have trusted me
to understand.

16:57.106 --> 16:58.983
All I want is for you to be happy.

16:59.191 --> 17:01.944
As long as I'm happy in the life
that you pick out for me.

17:02.194 --> 17:04.946
Excuse me for being
a terrible mother.

17:05.155 --> 17:06.865
All I do is care.

17:07.116 --> 17:08.575
Oh, here it comes, the guilt.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.203
Just because I don't want you
controlling my whole life.

17:11.412 --> 17:14.748
What do you want me to do about it,
cut myself out of it? You hate me?

17:14.957 --> 17:17.876
Sometimes, I do hate you!

17:22.548 --> 17:26.593
I'm sorry, Ma.
I shouldn't have said that.

17:26.801 --> 17:32.474
Why not? I am too involved.
It's because you're all I have.

17:32.683 --> 17:34.810
But you can't keep running my life.

17:35.060 --> 17:39.189
- Maybe we should just...
- Sit. We're nearly done.

17:43.568 --> 17:45.779
I have been smothering you.

17:45.946 --> 17:47.656
Maybe it's time I learned
to let you go.

17:47.864 --> 17:48.865
I don't wanna be let go.

17:49.074 --> 17:51.451
I want you in my life,
just not running it.

17:51.618 --> 17:56.957
- I do love you, Mom.
- Oh, baby. I love you too.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.673
- Well, we should go.
- Right.

18:07.300 --> 18:12.389
Oh, thank you for a lovely visit.
Enjoy your holiday.

18:12.931 --> 18:15.934
- I am so sorry about all this.
- Oh, that's all right. That's all right.

18:16.142 --> 18:17.519
Call me when you get back.

18:21.773 --> 18:23.483
Good night.

18:24.859 --> 18:27.529
- Boy, that was something.
- It certainly was.

18:27.737 --> 18:30.406
Yeah, we've had a couple squabbles
today, but nothing like that.

18:30.573 --> 18:32.700
No way.

18:33.451 --> 18:35.829
Maybe I should get that
Christmas tree out of the bathroom.

18:35.995 --> 18:39.332
Yeah, right. One minute, they're
talking about one little problem,

18:39.499 --> 18:42.168
then suddenly, it's everything else.

18:42.418 --> 18:44.963
Then it gets all emotional
and messy,

18:45.171 --> 18:48.925
and then they're hugging
and then it's all over.

18:49.175 --> 18:51.219
I suppose that's the healthiest way
to go about it.

18:51.386 --> 18:53.846
Yeah, yeah. I guess
you can't keep that stuff bottled up.

18:54.055 --> 18:56.015
No, you sit on it,
you just get madder and madder.

18:56.224 --> 18:57.850
Yeah, best thing
is lay it on the line.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.185
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

18:59.394 --> 19:03.689
Frasier, I want my Rudolph
out for Christmas.

19:04.148 --> 19:06.984
- What, this again?
- It's just not Christmas without it.

19:07.151 --> 19:09.987
Dad, we had an agreement about
the Christmas decorations this year.

19:10.196 --> 19:13.783
Yeah, but your Christmas stinks!
I mean, you call that a tree?

19:13.991 --> 19:17.828
Would it kill you to have a tasteful
Christmas just once in your life?

19:18.037 --> 19:19.497
Every year,
we do Christmas your way.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.250
And you have things your way
every damn day! I mean, look at it.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.919
There's nothing of mine
around this place except for my chair.

19:25.127 --> 19:27.254
And you've taken potshots
at that right from the start

19:27.463 --> 19:29.757
because it doesn't fit in
with your froufrou knickknacks.

19:29.965 --> 19:31.842
Right, go ahead,
ridicule everything I do.

19:32.051 --> 19:33.928
The way I eat, the way I decorate.

19:34.095 --> 19:35.971
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

19:36.180 --> 19:38.474
Know how it makes me feel
to live like a guest in my home?

19:38.682 --> 19:40.893
I do everything to make you feel
welcome in this house,

19:41.060 --> 19:42.436
but nothing I do is good enough!

19:42.645 --> 19:45.022
Strange way to make me feel
welcome, taking Christmas away.

19:45.231 --> 19:47.691
The one time of the year
when I get to do things my way,

19:47.858 --> 19:51.278
like it used to be in our home, with
your mother and when you were kids.

19:51.445 --> 19:52.905
You know,
that's a nice memory for me.

19:53.113 --> 19:55.449
You'd think, as a psychiatrist,
you'd figure that out.

19:55.699 --> 19:57.576
Oh, fine. Now, I'm not even
a good psychiatrist.

19:57.785 --> 19:59.495
I'm just a big, fat letdown, aren't I?

19:59.703 --> 20:01.330
I'm a burden to you.
I hate living here.

20:01.538 --> 20:03.791
And I hate you living here.

20:07.544 --> 20:09.338
- Oh, my God.
- Jeez.

20:09.546 --> 20:12.383
- Oh, God, I feel terrible.
- So do I.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.302
They were hugging by now.

20:16.637 --> 20:20.474
We never should have tried this.
We're not Jewish.

20:21.934 --> 20:25.103
Maybe Mrs. Shapiro next door
can talk us through it.

20:25.354 --> 20:28.190
- She's out of town.
- Oh, no.

20:29.066 --> 20:31.652
I'm sorry.
I never should have said what I said.

20:31.902 --> 20:35.322
Oh, Dad, no, I should have been
more sensitive. I am a psychiatrist.

20:35.489 --> 20:37.950
And you're a damned good one, too,
and I'm very proud of you.

20:38.158 --> 20:39.326
- Really?
- Yes.

20:39.534 --> 20:42.287
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean any
of the things I said.

20:42.454 --> 20:44.164
I love having you here.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.166
Well, I love being here.
I always have.

20:46.416 --> 20:47.501
Honestly?

20:47.751 --> 20:50.212
Well, no, but I thought
it'd get us to the hug.

20:51.046 --> 20:52.172
All right, let's try.
