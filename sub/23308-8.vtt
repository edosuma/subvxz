00:00.023 --> 00:01.407
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:01.418 --> 00:04.715
Fray isn't yours. Your real
daughter died during childbirth.

00:04.825 --> 00:05.825
She died?

00:05.836 --> 00:08.044
- All right, I can help you.
- Is that cocaine?

00:08.055 --> 00:10.844
It's the excretion of
a very rare magical creature.

00:12.381 --> 00:14.498
- Penny, Sylvia.
- I'm babysitting now?

00:14.509 --> 00:15.872
Sylvia is your supervisor.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.843
If you can't bring me
back, you die too, Penny.

00:17.854 --> 00:19.939
Benedict... do not do it!

00:19.950 --> 00:22.191
No!

00:22.201 --> 00:25.272
Mmm... yummy.

00:25.283 --> 00:29.339
Children of Earth have been making a
mess of things here for some time.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.608
She planned this.

00:30.618 --> 00:34.645
I'm your queen, you motherfuckers!

00:36.924 --> 00:39.316
- What are you doing?
- Short-circuiting your panic attack.

00:39.327 --> 00:40.958
Wait a minute, I... I... I
know these people.

00:40.969 --> 00:41.971
Well, every book is here,

00:41.982 --> 00:43.841
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

00:43.852 --> 00:45.956
It's not like I can just
travel to the Underworld.

00:45.966 --> 00:47.298
So we need a gatekeeper.

00:47.309 --> 00:48.852
What about the Library's dragon?

00:48.863 --> 00:50.444
They call it the Bookwyrm.

00:50.455 --> 00:53.224
I hear they use it to send books
to and from the Underworld.

00:53.235 --> 00:55.599
Well, what if the person was a book?

00:55.609 --> 00:58.469
Say I get the Key and send it back up,

00:58.479 --> 01:01.538
it's stuck in the Satellite Library.
We need another traveler.

01:01.548 --> 01:02.973
Okay, I work with this group now.

01:02.983 --> 01:05.509
It's kind of about
freedom of information.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.284
You have to go, if that's
what you wanna do.

01:07.295 --> 01:08.612
I'm sorry we're cursed.

Damn it!

02:16.621 --> 02:18.512
Hey, uh, guy...

02:18.522 --> 02:20.514
Yeah, what is this?

02:20.524 --> 02:21.916
Temp housing, and before you ask,

02:21.926 --> 02:23.685
yes, the system is still down.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.852
Rations arrive Tuesday.
Smoking is prohibited.

02:25.862 --> 02:27.388
The outhouses to your left.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.022
Outhouses here? No, look, I... I'm...

02:29.032 --> 02:31.733
- I'm just looking for someone.
- Did you file a request?

02:33.370 --> 02:35.963
You'll have to hand-deliver it
to the Underworld Hotel.

02:35.973 --> 02:39.032
This is an emergency, okay?
I really, really can't wait.

02:39.042 --> 02:41.468
I might be able to help, unofficially,

02:41.478 --> 02:44.071
if, uh...

02:44.081 --> 02:45.606
Yeah, uh...

02:45.616 --> 02:47.774
what the hell do you
bribe dead people with?

02:47.784 --> 02:49.985
Uh... is there money here?

02:52.155 --> 02:53.747
And what about the White Walkers?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.115
Oh, the White Walkers?

02:55.125 --> 02:56.783
Yeah, I mean, those guys are bad news.

02:56.793 --> 02:58.514
You know, but then
the British-sounding dude

02:58.525 --> 02:59.986
came and, uh, you know,
kicked their asses, so...

02:59.996 --> 03:02.555
- W... wait, who was that?
- You know!

03:02.565 --> 03:04.424
You know, dope outfit.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.659
Speaks in rhymes. Has eight dragons.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.728
Where did he get so many dragons?

03:08.738 --> 03:12.665
I mean... that's the question.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.066
So, you know, he came in

03:14.076 --> 03:16.736
and, uh, won the throne game.

03:16.746 --> 03:18.771
Well, no one does a twist like they do.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.507
Okay, what's your friend's name?

03:21.517 --> 03:23.575
Hi, um, I'm looking for Benedict.

03:23.585 --> 03:25.678
- Go away.
- Benedict?

03:25.688 --> 03:27.412
I'm dead! Go away!

03:27.422 --> 03:29.123
It's... it's Penny.

03:30.592 --> 03:32.651
Oh, Penny, my friend!

03:32.661 --> 03:35.187
Oh... okay. Um...

03:35.197 --> 03:37.656
Good hug.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.458
Yeah, let's call this, man.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.305
You can't imagine how
terrible this place is.

03:41.316 --> 03:42.927
I'm so happy to see you.

03:42.937 --> 03:45.164
That isn't to say I'm... I'm...
I'm sorry you're dead.

03:45.174 --> 03:46.532
Oh, yeah, about that:

03:46.542 --> 03:48.466
No, I'm... I'm not technically, uh...

03:48.476 --> 03:49.701
I came to find you.

03:49.711 --> 03:51.602
- You did?
- Yeah.

03:51.612 --> 03:53.672
- Oh!
- Okay, we're...

03:53.682 --> 03:55.940
and we're hugging again.

03:55.950 --> 03:59.511
When you died, were you holding a key?

04:01.965 --> 04:03.251
Are you here for the key?

04:03.791 --> 04:05.783
- Yeah, do you have it?
- I thought you, uh...

04:05.793 --> 04:08.118
because we were friends, that, um...

04:08.128 --> 04:10.555
Oh, um...

04:10.565 --> 04:13.624
Yeah, look, we're not not friends.

04:13.634 --> 04:14.852
It's just, you know,

04:14.863 --> 04:17.127
I'm... I'm on a mission,
and... and if we are friends...

04:17.137 --> 04:18.995
- I am your friend!
- Then give me the key...

04:19.005 --> 04:20.869
uh, please?

04:20.880 --> 04:23.014
- They... they took it.
- Who?

04:24.044 --> 04:26.170
Well, the Library.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.972
Of course. Fuck me.

04:28.982 --> 04:31.008
I just snuck out of there. Damn it!

04:31.019 --> 04:33.846
Well, the Library's the only part of
the Underworld that functions now.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.145
It's well-protected.

04:35.155 --> 04:38.582
I'd say just cut your losses. There's
no way you can get in there.

04:38.592 --> 04:40.550
Yeah, there is.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.984
I'm a Librarian.

04:41.994 --> 04:44.754
Currently on the lam from
a billion-year contract.

04:44.764 --> 04:46.489
Oh, well, like I said...

04:46.499 --> 04:48.491
best let go of it.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.161
Of all of magic?

04:52.171 --> 04:54.997
Would you let that go?

04:55.007 --> 04:56.833
Oh, well, I'll figure it out,

04:56.843 --> 04:58.768
find the Key,
avoid indentured servitude...

04:58.778 --> 05:01.536
Oh, even in death, you lead an
exciting life. I'll... I'll help.

05:01.547 --> 05:03.710
- No... no, that's okay.
- I insist! I can help you sneak.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.174
I can...

05:05.517 --> 05:07.176
Great. Yeah!

05:07.186 --> 05:08.667
We'll go together.

05:08.678 --> 05:11.013
I just... you know, I just
need to find one more person...

05:11.024 --> 05:13.307
And then, uh, we'll loop back
and grab you in ten, okay?

05:13.318 --> 05:15.015
- Okay, no hugging.
- Okay.

05:15.026 --> 05:16.339
- All right.
- I'll be here.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.064
- I'm gonna go this way.
- Okay.

05:33.037 --> 05:35.174
- Hi, Penny.
- Sylvia?

05:35.914 --> 05:38.547
You're about to do something stupid.

05:40.152 --> 05:42.610
I'm sorry...

05:42.620 --> 05:44.145
for leaving you behind in...

05:44.155 --> 05:45.813
Oh, you mean in the Poison Room?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.114
God, I was a goner.

05:47.124 --> 05:48.916
- I'm not mad.
- I am.

05:48.926 --> 05:50.341
Well, don't be.

05:50.352 --> 05:53.053
I'm fine, well, for a dead girl.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.988
You, on the other hand,
are not doing so hot,

05:54.999 --> 05:56.658
between the stuck-in-the-astral thing

05:56.668 --> 05:58.660
and the 'bout-to-fuck-up-royally thing.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.327
How do you know I'm...

06:00.337 --> 06:03.330
Oh, the same way I knew
that you were here right now.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.482
- It is written.
- What is that?

06:05.493 --> 06:07.634
Trust me, your best bet
of finding that key

06:07.644 --> 06:09.804
is with the person
who wrote these pages.

06:09.814 --> 06:11.057
Follow me.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.694
Cassandra? I brought a friend.

06:38.942 --> 06:40.471
Alice?

06:48.398 --> 06:50.757
Cassandra, calm down. It's okay.

06:50.768 --> 06:53.427
- It's okay.
- What the hell is going on?

06:53.437 --> 06:56.430
Cassandra doesn't like to see
anybody that she writes about.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.855
I'm sorry, but she just looks
exactly like a friend of mine,

06:59.866 --> 07:01.583
who, last time I checked,
was still alive.

07:01.594 --> 07:04.525
I don't know what to tell you. She's
been here thousands of years.

07:04.536 --> 07:07.519
- Make him go away.
- I can't. He needs your help.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.881
Here's the deal:

07:14.891 --> 07:16.950
- Cassandra has a gift.
- A curse.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.753
She kinda got involved with this guy...

07:19.763 --> 07:21.255
God.

07:21.265 --> 07:23.423
And it didn't end well,
and he was pissed,

07:23.433 --> 07:25.424
so he gave her magical sight.

07:25.434 --> 07:26.960
She can see the future.

07:26.970 --> 07:28.394
This should sound familiar,

07:28.404 --> 07:29.929
if you've read any ancient myths.

07:29.939 --> 07:31.430
The one that no one believed

07:31.440 --> 07:33.432
and it drove her batshit crazy?

07:33.442 --> 07:35.101
Quiet, squirrels.

07:35.111 --> 07:37.103
I guess some Librarians found her

07:37.113 --> 07:39.072
and got her to start
writing everything down.

07:39.082 --> 07:41.274
Wait, she's the person
that writes the books

07:41.284 --> 07:42.908
of the people in the Library?

07:42.918 --> 07:44.143
Well, yes and no.

07:44.153 --> 07:46.312
She can only write one at a time.

07:46.322 --> 07:48.881
So, at some point,
the Librarians wrote a spell

07:48.891 --> 07:50.800
to, like, industrialize her thing,

07:50.811 --> 07:52.385
and that's how all books were written.

07:52.395 --> 07:53.986
That stopped when magic did,

07:53.996 --> 07:56.254
and now it's just her,
one book at a time.

07:56.265 --> 07:58.290
Trying to concentrate.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.592
Anyway, I take her pages
to the Bookwyrm,

08:00.602 --> 08:02.061
and I read that you were here,

08:02.071 --> 08:03.829
and then, I read
that I come to help you,

08:03.839 --> 08:05.297
and so I did, and here we are.

08:05.307 --> 08:06.899
Out of 7 billion people in the world,

08:06.909 --> 08:08.049
she's writing about me?

08:08.060 --> 08:10.602
Well, you and your buds are
on a quest to restore magic,

08:10.612 --> 08:12.304
making you maybe our only hope.

08:12.314 --> 08:13.605
- No presh.
- So, what do we do?

08:13.615 --> 08:15.307
Do we just... do we just wait for her

08:15.317 --> 08:17.609
to maybe write about the lost key?

08:23.258 --> 08:26.318
This one seems to be
about Poppy and Quentin...

08:28.330 --> 08:30.662
God, it's a sex scene.

08:31.939 --> 08:34.325
I'm worried that the plan won't work.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.157
Well, that means my plan
definitely didn't work.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.582
What plan is that?

08:40.506 --> 08:42.744
The one where I bang
the panic right out of you.

08:42.755 --> 08:46.065
I don't know how Harriet
thinks we pull this off.

08:46.214 --> 08:50.006
It's incredibly dangerous, and
I don't think that we are...

08:50.016 --> 08:53.310
fully... you know, equipped.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.178
I assure you, Quentin,

08:55.188 --> 08:56.913
I'm fully equipped.

08:56.923 --> 08:58.682
I can't ask you

08:58.692 --> 09:00.917
to risk your life for my quest.

09:02.429 --> 09:07.057
Real talk, I'm a very self-interested
person, and I want magic back.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.893
And how do we know
it's not my quest too?

09:09.903 --> 09:12.328
Maybe I'm the second act
add-on that saves the world.

09:12.338 --> 09:14.597
Maybe you have to bring me

09:14.607 --> 09:16.399
or you totally fail, hmm?

09:16.409 --> 09:18.501
I don't think that's how this works.

09:18.511 --> 09:20.169
If it's such a bad idea,

09:20.179 --> 09:21.604
then why are you going?

09:21.614 --> 09:24.607
Because it's the opposite
of what I usually do.

09:24.617 --> 09:28.411
A quest is supposed to change a quester.

09:28.421 --> 09:30.513
The person who starts it

09:30.523 --> 09:33.115
couldn't, you know, finish it.

09:33.125 --> 09:36.085
So run a gauntlet to get the keys,

09:36.095 --> 09:37.953
and the gauntlet is what
makes you the guy

09:37.963 --> 09:39.188
that can get the keys?

09:39.198 --> 09:40.923
Exactly.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.058
I know what I have to be

09:43.068 --> 09:45.261
to win this quest:

09:45.271 --> 09:48.597
a... hero.

09:48.607 --> 09:52.434
I also know what I am,
which is not that, so...

09:52.444 --> 09:54.102
Okay...

09:54.112 --> 09:56.538
I reject your whole premise.

09:56.548 --> 09:58.940
That's all people do: try to change.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.310
The real me is an asshole
with no filter.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.744
Believe me, I tried.

10:02.754 --> 10:05.113
Eventually, I realized

10:05.123 --> 10:07.416
the brave thing is to be you

10:07.426 --> 10:10.051
and accept the consequences.

10:10.061 --> 10:13.454
Who's to say that isn't
the key to the quest?

10:23.007 --> 10:24.565
Shit's about to get awkward, huh?

10:24.575 --> 10:25.827
Oh, because you slept with Q?

10:25.838 --> 10:28.402
Yeah, I'm not really worried
about his penis right now.

10:28.412 --> 10:31.505
I'm more worried about
how he's about to get killed.

10:31.515 --> 10:34.442
- Robbing the Library?
- Oh.

10:34.452 --> 10:36.410
How are you even gonna get there?

10:36.420 --> 10:38.679
We have a traveler: Victoria.

10:38.689 --> 10:41.238
But how's she gonna travel you?
That part's a spell.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.392
Yeah, so, we're not doing that.

10:43.417 --> 10:46.169
- Travelers are magical creatures...
- They're technically hybrids.

10:46.180 --> 10:47.587
Fine, whatever.

10:47.597 --> 10:49.689
All I know is that we can use her DNA.

10:49.699 --> 10:51.762
She's gonna build a Mirror Bridge.

10:51.773 --> 10:55.195
- All we need is, uh...
- PHD-level skill and patience

10:55.205 --> 10:58.165
and more traveler blood than
she has in her entire body.

10:58.175 --> 10:59.499
Exactly.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.768
Look, I know the physics
of Mirror Bridges

11:01.778 --> 11:04.135
- from when I was a...
- Sociopathic energy monster?

11:04.146 --> 11:05.389
Yeah.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.174
Bridges are usually built
between hedge witch safe houses

11:08.184 --> 11:09.642
a hundred miles apart, max.

11:09.652 --> 11:11.778
Well, we're better than hedges.

11:11.788 --> 11:13.301
Light years better?

11:13.312 --> 11:15.614
You do know that the distance
changes the metamath, right?

11:15.624 --> 11:18.035
So if you're not perfect, Victoria dies.

11:18.046 --> 11:20.186
- Forget it. I'm out.
- Okay, hold on.

11:20.196 --> 11:22.355
I was on the fence
when it sounded semi-safe.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.535
Now it sounds a lot like
I could get everyone killed.

11:24.546 --> 11:27.307
We don't do it until we get the
math right, and I'll make sure that...

11:27.318 --> 11:30.229
None of us understands
how the Bridge works.

11:30.239 --> 11:31.530
Alice does.

11:31.540 --> 11:34.032
Get her to do the math, we can talk.

11:34.042 --> 11:36.422
She said, "I already talked to Alice.
She's not gonna help."

11:36.433 --> 11:37.946
Look, it's simple.

11:37.957 --> 11:40.650
Prove to me the Bridge
will be stable, or I'm out.

11:40.661 --> 11:42.119
Victoria, wait...

11:42.130 --> 11:44.464
Oh, shit. Fuck.

11:46.087 --> 11:48.079
What do we do now?

11:52.860 --> 11:55.220
What is she after?

11:55.230 --> 11:57.555
- Harriet?
- What do you mean?

11:57.565 --> 12:00.091
If we're gonna risk
our lives to help her,

12:00.101 --> 12:01.600
we deserve to know why.

12:04.839 --> 12:06.764
Okay.

12:06.774 --> 12:09.233
Library's been searching for this thing

12:09.243 --> 12:11.101
called the Alexandria Cell.

12:11.111 --> 12:12.570
It's a huge battery.

12:12.580 --> 12:15.205
Librarians from ancient Egypt made it,

12:15.215 --> 12:19.076
and if they followed the plans,
it is fucking massive.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.178
And Harriet thinks that they found it?

12:21.188 --> 12:24.748
Or her people saw Librarians
doing magic on Earth,

12:24.758 --> 12:26.750
big magic.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.352
But none of it matters

12:28.363 --> 12:30.405
if we can't get to the Satellite branch.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.226
Niffin notes.

12:36.236 --> 12:39.529
Pages and pages about Mirror Bridges.

12:39.539 --> 12:41.898
How did... how did you
convince her to help us?

12:41.908 --> 12:44.901
Didn't. I stole them.

12:44.911 --> 12:47.482
I'll make copies and put them
back before she comes home

12:47.493 --> 12:49.333
from wherever she went
to sulk and be a martyr.

12:49.344 --> 12:51.808
No, this is... this is not a good idea.

12:51.818 --> 12:54.410
Under the circumstances,
it seemed worth it.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.279
See?

12:56.289 --> 12:58.547
Just had to be myself.

13:08.801 --> 13:10.460
Okay...

13:10.470 --> 13:12.728
Be careful when you step through.

13:33.096 --> 13:35.817
Okay. I have to stay
and feed the sigils,

13:35.827 --> 13:38.453
so, you know, take your time.

13:38.463 --> 13:39.787
We'll hurry.

13:39.797 --> 13:41.689
Thank you, Victoria.

14:08.526 --> 14:11.519
Okay, she says, "Go left down the hall."

14:11.529 --> 14:14.039
Said, "You'll find the book drop chute."

14:14.865 --> 14:16.490
"The Bookwyrm's inside." Okay.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.391
Wait, have you been here before?

14:21.905 --> 14:24.531
Well, okay... well, let's go before
Victoria bleeds out. Come on.

14:31.214 --> 14:33.673
Penny said he'd hide it in a book.

14:49.031 --> 14:51.591
Make sure to check the chute.
Might be stuck.

14:55.905 --> 14:58.931
Okay, no books. Just an actual dragon.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.532
Ooh.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.534
Uh... God damn it, we don't have time.

15:04.013 --> 15:05.605
Oh, fuck it.

15:07.749 --> 15:09.677
- Hello?
- Key's not here.

15:09.948 --> 15:11.876
What?

15:11.886 --> 15:14.012
So, Penny failed?

15:14.022 --> 15:16.377
Shit. Uh, maybe he did. I...

15:16.388 --> 15:18.049
Well, we can't just stand here and wait.

15:18.059 --> 15:19.884
No, we need the key.

15:19.894 --> 15:22.754
I just realized
my part to play in this quest.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.923
I'm here to tell you
it is time to cut bait and run.

15:24.933 --> 15:26.591
- Just live another day.
- No, we can't.

15:26.601 --> 15:28.953
- Kady and Harriet...
- They are on their own trip,

15:28.964 --> 15:30.106
and call me crazy,

15:30.117 --> 15:32.530
but I don't think any of this
is worth Victoria's life.

15:43.618 --> 15:45.610
Alice, what the hell?

15:47.455 --> 15:49.713
Come on, we gotta go.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.461
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

16:04.471 --> 16:05.629
Come with me.

16:05.639 --> 16:07.898
No, they'll be stuck.

16:11.779 --> 16:13.403
Do what you need to do.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.333
This can't be right.
The key's not there.

16:28.344 --> 16:29.784
Quentin's about to
bail without me.

16:29.795 --> 16:32.064
Well, "about to": That means
that there's still a chance.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.580
A lot of this is still
in the future, so...

16:33.591 --> 16:36.072
And what the hell is Alice is
doing in the Satellite branch?

16:36.083 --> 16:38.828
You'd think she could
at least answer that.

16:38.839 --> 16:42.054
Alice, if you're in there, please...

16:42.065 --> 16:44.232
Where is the key?

16:46.169 --> 16:47.735
Fuck.

16:51.741 --> 16:54.409
Here's a bright idea:
Keep fucking reading.

17:00.383 --> 17:02.909
<i>- We're better than hedges.
- Light years better?</i>

17:02.919 --> 17:06.781
You do know the distance
changes the metamath, right?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.843
If you're not perfect,
Victoria will die.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.791
Then help.

17:14.663 --> 17:16.821
Look, bottom line, Alice,

17:16.832 --> 17:19.325
you told Poppy
the Mirror Bridge won't work.

17:19.335 --> 17:21.426
Now Victoria's not gonna help.

17:21.436 --> 17:23.534
It won't work.

17:23.545 --> 17:25.263
Would you rather I didn't tell her

17:25.273 --> 17:28.008
and just let you guys
walk off into deep space?

17:31.253 --> 17:34.187
She asked, "Have you
been to the Library?"

17:35.350 --> 17:36.651
Once.

17:37.352 --> 17:38.918
I wasn't there long.

17:40.288 --> 17:42.247
"Brochure makes it sound great.

17:42.257 --> 17:46.017
"They collect knowledge, keep it safe...

17:46.029 --> 17:47.351
but from who?"

17:47.362 --> 17:48.853
Whom.

17:48.863 --> 17:51.030
I said "whom."

17:53.034 --> 17:55.019
"The Library buries information.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.913
"Only the people they choose get access.

17:57.924 --> 17:59.000
The rest of us"...

17:59.011 --> 18:02.300
You just wanna let all that
knowledge loose for anyone to use?

18:02.310 --> 18:04.802
For good or bad?

18:04.812 --> 18:06.871
"Don't tell me there isn't
a book in the Library

18:06.881 --> 18:08.870
"you wouldn't die to read.

18:09.717 --> 18:11.408
"If you help us,

18:11.418 --> 18:13.548
we can offer you a piece
of what we find there."

18:13.559 --> 18:14.884
What's that?

18:14.895 --> 18:16.884
The biggest battery ever created.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.295
You wanna help Penny? This is how.

18:22.796 --> 18:24.571
If I say yes, that means risking lives

18:24.582 --> 18:27.608
to give you power
maybe no one should have.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.061
No thank you.

18:51.007 --> 18:52.773
Door was stuck.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.685
Can I have one of those?

18:55.695 --> 18:57.653
So, I left.

18:57.663 --> 19:00.857
Just needed a little space
from the ol' ball and cock.

19:02.235 --> 19:05.128
It's "ball and chain," I think you mean.

19:05.138 --> 19:08.798
No, that doesn't sound right.

19:08.808 --> 19:11.801
I think I know what you mean.

19:11.811 --> 19:14.871
I lost a lot of people recently,

19:14.881 --> 19:17.673
including kind of myself.

19:17.683 --> 19:20.710
Mm. That makes no sense.

19:20.720 --> 19:23.312
I had everything. I knew
everything there was to know

19:23.323 --> 19:27.191
in every book and more,
and... and I lost it.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.660
I'm sorry...

19:32.364 --> 19:37.259
You think that's the same
kind of problem at all?

19:37.269 --> 19:39.428
My daughter's gone...

19:39.438 --> 19:41.430
forever.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.932
You forgot some stuff?

19:43.942 --> 19:47.363
What you lost is still out there.

19:48.436 --> 19:49.987
Go get it back.

19:53.718 --> 19:57.019
Umber's ass, I am drunk.

20:12.555 --> 20:14.262
Oh, Christ.

20:14.272 --> 20:16.730
No. The answer's no.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.198
You don't even know what I want.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.934
You're a Library groupie.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.932
You got a knowledge boner.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.405
How'd you find out
about this place anyway?

20:25.415 --> 20:27.040
- It was Karen.
- What?

20:27.050 --> 20:28.476
N... no, Penny told me.

20:28.486 --> 20:30.077
Bad news, book tart.

20:30.087 --> 20:32.920
The Library's closed, indefinitely.

20:35.058 --> 20:36.858
I got bored waiting.

20:40.594 --> 20:43.323
Look, I need to speak to your boss.
I have something she'll want.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.226
Oh. You're so mysterious.

20:46.236 --> 20:48.161
It's important, asshole.

20:48.171 --> 20:49.871
Fine.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.704
Come on then.

20:53.715 --> 20:56.002
Wait, this shouldn't work
without Wellspring magic.

20:56.012 --> 20:57.668
How can you...

21:02.797 --> 21:04.110
Alice Quinn.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.186
Till we meet again, book tart.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.349
If you're his supervisor,
I wanna file a complaint.

21:10.359 --> 21:12.836
Roguish belligerency is
a common trait among travelers.

21:12.847 --> 21:15.480
How can he take people
with him when he travels?

21:16.265 --> 21:17.990
You really do have a battery.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.425
Is that why you're here?

21:19.435 --> 21:21.093
No, I don't care about the battery.

21:21.103 --> 21:23.261
Well... of course I do.

21:23.271 --> 21:25.030
All I want is a Library Card.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.500
We're no longer accepting
new applications.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.435
What do you know about niffins?

21:30.445 --> 21:32.303
I was one for a time,

21:32.313 --> 21:35.941
and this is all I can remember.
It's half of a puzzle.

21:35.951 --> 21:37.442
The other pieces fell out of my head,

21:37.452 --> 21:40.178
but... they could be inside your books.

21:40.188 --> 21:42.780
You are suggesting
a trade of information?

21:42.790 --> 21:44.049
More than that.

21:44.059 --> 21:45.950
I wanna finish what I started:

21:45.960 --> 21:48.219
a Grand Unified Theory of Magic.

21:48.229 --> 21:51.289
But you're just a human
Magician with no magic now.

21:51.299 --> 21:53.058
I'm afraid your experiences as a niffin

21:53.068 --> 21:55.400
have already been documented
to our satisfaction.

21:57.504 --> 21:59.637
It's in my book.

21:59.648 --> 22:02.466
You don't want me to finish.
Is... is that it?

22:02.476 --> 22:04.134
There is something you could do for us,

22:04.144 --> 22:07.954
and, in exchange, we would give you
full access to our collection.

22:08.983 --> 22:12.409
You're familiar with
the Quest for the Seven Keys?

22:18.158 --> 22:20.050
Excuse me a moment.

22:25.499 --> 22:26.923
Alice, what the hell?

22:28.568 --> 22:30.026
Come on, we gotta go.

22:34.401 --> 22:36.392
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

22:36.403 --> 22:38.595
How do you just keep appearing?

22:38.894 --> 22:40.519
What were you...

22:40.529 --> 22:43.287
Alice, are you working with the Library?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.353
Q, you have to go.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.564
Okay, great, then let's go.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.205
Alice, come on.

22:51.225 --> 22:53.492
Q, please...

23:01.086 --> 23:03.758
The bookish girl joins the Library.
Didn't see that coming.

23:03.769 --> 23:05.797
Yeah, little bit of a bigger problem.

23:05.808 --> 23:08.531
Quentin left without the key!

23:09.676 --> 23:11.133
This is it, right?

23:11.615 --> 23:14.649
An actual... answer?

23:15.929 --> 23:19.762
<i>Yes, I do want to make
a final statement.</i>

23:19.773 --> 23:21.238
I...

23:21.249 --> 23:24.330
hate... Fillory.

23:24.341 --> 23:26.034
It is a backwards,

23:26.045 --> 23:28.335
malodorous shithole

23:28.345 --> 23:31.505
full of animals who are smarter
than they're supposed to be

23:31.515 --> 23:35.316
and humans who are so much dumber.

23:35.819 --> 23:38.845
And what you'd call indoor plumbing,

23:38.855 --> 23:41.244
we on Earth would call

23:41.255 --> 23:43.038
a war crime.

23:43.395 --> 23:44.659
But...

23:45.348 --> 23:47.687
when I was drowning,

23:47.698 --> 23:50.120
Fillory saved me,

23:50.131 --> 23:52.490
and now it's my turn to save Fillory.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.495
But I can't do that
if my head's in a basket,

23:55.505 --> 23:58.664
so if it pleases the...

24:00.543 --> 24:02.402
You guys...

24:02.412 --> 24:05.604
I demand that this
trial/peasant uprising

24:05.614 --> 24:07.407
be dismissed...

24:09.451 --> 24:12.077
Your honorable wombat-ness.

24:12.087 --> 24:15.447
What the shit is this?

24:15.457 --> 24:17.323
Why is he talking to a marsupial?

24:17.334 --> 24:19.703
- This is not at all relevant!
- Would you just chill?

24:19.714 --> 24:22.696
- You're gonna piss her off again.
- Next!

24:39.247 --> 24:41.372
How's Alice?

24:41.382 --> 24:45.109
Uh, well, she's not my
favorite person at the moment,

24:45.120 --> 24:46.974
but, um, the transfer worked,
so thank you.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.446
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it.

24:48.456 --> 24:50.915
- Yeah.
- Uh... so you're...

24:50.925 --> 24:53.284
Yeah, back to powered up.

24:53.294 --> 24:54.752
Good...

24:54.762 --> 24:57.121
because I've, uh, come here

24:57.131 --> 24:59.731
to collect on that favor
that you owe me.

25:02.942 --> 25:04.164
Oh, my God.

25:04.175 --> 25:05.499
Yeah.

25:06.096 --> 25:08.623
Side-effect from
the powder that I gave you.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.300
- Um...
- Oh, don't worry.

25:10.311 --> 25:12.047
No, you haven't used nearly enough.

25:12.058 --> 25:13.337
No, you're safe.

25:13.347 --> 25:17.307
Look, there is a treatment,
but it's big magic.

25:17.317 --> 25:18.809
I... I can't do it on myself,

25:18.819 --> 25:21.526
because it would just make things worse.

25:21.537 --> 25:22.899
So...

25:25.325 --> 25:26.950
Here's what we'll need.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.445
My office, 3:00 p.m.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.821
A fairy?

25:31.831 --> 25:35.791
And I can't see her, because
I've never made a fairy deal?

25:35.801 --> 25:37.793
- This is what they do...
- Okay?

25:37.803 --> 25:39.829
They hide behind powerful people,

25:39.839 --> 25:42.665
manipulate them into
doing terrible things...

25:42.675 --> 25:44.501
Wait a minute, at Irene's house,

25:44.511 --> 25:45.868
Penny said that he...

25:45.878 --> 25:47.837
he thought that he saw something moving

25:47.847 --> 25:49.672
that... that Q and I couldn't see.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.258
There's more of them? Oh, no.

25:52.269 --> 25:54.209
No, what I'm... what I'm saying is

25:54.219 --> 25:57.947
I'm not so sure that they're
manipulating much of anything.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.682
They were doing chores.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.265
- Wait, what was Irene's fairy doing?
- Just...

26:03.219 --> 26:05.354
standing there,
like she was waiting on Irene,

26:05.364 --> 26:07.523
and her head was sort of bowed, but...

26:07.533 --> 26:08.638
Bowed? Wait, that's...

26:08.649 --> 26:10.426
I mean, that kind of
sounds like a servant.

26:10.437 --> 26:11.815
You can't trust them.

26:12.458 --> 26:15.581
I don't know why they'd be
acting that way, but...

26:15.592 --> 26:17.503
Do you have slavery in Fillory?

26:17.876 --> 26:21.335
If these fairies are slaves,
you'd be better off.

26:21.345 --> 26:22.804
Fen...

26:22.814 --> 26:26.100
no one is better off with slavery.

26:26.111 --> 26:29.138
Look, I have this tiny spark of magic,

26:29.484 --> 26:31.412
and it seems like when I use it

26:31.422 --> 26:34.582
to do good things, to help people,

26:34.592 --> 26:36.250
it... it grows.

26:36.260 --> 26:39.487
I didn't ask for it,
and I can't get rid of it.

26:39.497 --> 26:41.234
If I want it to be
anything but a burden,

26:41.245 --> 26:42.618
I have to use it.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.759
My daughter's dead because of them.

26:45.769 --> 26:47.696
Fen, we need to know,

26:47.707 --> 26:49.299
and I can't see her.

26:49.310 --> 26:52.044
You need to talk to Irene's fairy.

27:09.026 --> 27:11.918
Hey. What's your name?

27:11.928 --> 27:13.587
Yes...

27:13.597 --> 27:15.922
I can see you.

27:15.932 --> 27:18.584
I'm... I'm not supposed to talk to you.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.193
Why not?

27:23.496 --> 27:25.703
You must answer me.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.350
Irene will be very angry if you don't.

27:29.755 --> 27:31.305
Of course. Of course.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.934
Um... I'm sorry.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.607
- Oh, shit, you are her slave.
- No.

27:35.618 --> 27:38.336
Okay, Miss McAllistair keeps us
safe from bad Magicians.

27:38.347 --> 27:40.205
She hides us.

27:40.216 --> 27:41.883
In exchange for what?

27:44.393 --> 27:45.984
How is it you can see me?

27:45.994 --> 27:47.586
I made a deal.

27:47.596 --> 27:50.822
Well, a deal was made on my behalf...

27:50.832 --> 27:52.625
with a fairy.

27:52.636 --> 27:55.770
But... there are no other fairies.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.982
Oh, I'm late. Miss will be waiting.

28:06.782 --> 28:09.138
Uh... can we...

28:09.149 --> 28:10.675
talk again tomorrow?

28:10.685 --> 28:13.019
Miss Irene won't be home.

28:15.103 --> 28:17.081
My name is Skye.

28:23.798 --> 28:26.090
No sign of fairies.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.419
Then let's look in here first.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.133
If, uh, we don't find Skye, we'll
have to break into the main house,

28:30.144 --> 28:32.155
hope that Irene doesn't come home.

28:42.349 --> 28:43.808
Fen, what is it? What do you see?

28:43.818 --> 28:45.976
It's her. It's Skye. She's...

28:45.986 --> 28:48.012
oh, God, they cut off her leg.

28:55.729 --> 28:57.120
Hey...

29:04.696 --> 29:07.319
It's what the powder's made of.

29:07.743 --> 29:09.064
What happened to you?

29:09.075 --> 29:10.641
Who did this?

29:12.780 --> 29:15.046
Irene did.

38:51.514 --> 38:53.092
They left.

38:53.389 --> 38:55.754
The Mirror Bridge is gone.

38:56.391 --> 38:58.283
Alice...

38:58.294 --> 39:02.087
just talk to me. Come on.

39:02.097 --> 39:03.588
I'm not Alice.

39:08.670 --> 39:10.229
God damn it!

39:31.526 --> 39:33.053
What is it?

39:33.696 --> 39:36.420
Quentin and Poppy: sex scene.

39:36.431 --> 39:38.456
That you kinda skimmed, prude.

39:38.466 --> 39:41.259
Um, not that I'm complaining, but, um...

39:41.269 --> 39:43.594
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

39:43.604 --> 39:45.096
'Cause I can only go so long

39:45.106 --> 39:47.432
feeling completely alone and worthless,

39:47.442 --> 39:50.276
before I break down
and do something stupid.

39:53.447 --> 39:56.306
Right. You're an idiot.

39:56.316 --> 39:58.951
- Quentin?
- No, me!

40:01.121 --> 40:02.513
<i>Look, I get it.</i>

40:02.523 --> 40:04.601
You didn't want me
to bail on you, so you lied,

40:04.612 --> 40:07.317
and then I bailed on you anyway.

40:07.327 --> 40:10.128
Be mad. Don't be stupid.

40:11.631 --> 40:13.957
I buried it. Sorry.

40:13.967 --> 40:16.279
I spent so much of my life alone,

40:16.290 --> 40:18.390
the thought of spending
the rest of time...

40:19.638 --> 40:21.923
I thought you were my friend,

40:21.934 --> 40:23.626
and I thought...

40:24.243 --> 40:26.668
if you couldn't find
the key, eventually you'd...

40:27.335 --> 40:28.371
I don't know...

40:28.381 --> 40:30.339
What, decide to hang out
in your dumb tent?

40:30.349 --> 40:32.709
I thought we'd spruce it up together.

40:37.323 --> 40:39.015
Look...

40:39.025 --> 40:42.318
don't ask me how I know this, but...

40:42.328 --> 40:46.690
you are the only person
who cried when I died.

40:46.701 --> 40:49.758
We are friends, and I appreciate you,

40:49.768 --> 40:51.899
so, listen...

40:51.910 --> 40:55.664
once you show me where the
key is buried, Sylvia...

40:55.674 --> 40:58.202
is gonna take you
to the Library map room.

40:58.213 --> 41:01.669
You are going to be very popular.

41:13.124 --> 41:16.418
Well, um, I guess this is it.

41:18.063 --> 41:20.188
Well, until the next time I die, anyway.

41:20.198 --> 41:22.357
And I want the record to show
that I helped you get that key,

41:22.367 --> 41:24.459
making this the second time
I saved your ass.

41:24.469 --> 41:26.361
Oh, my gosh.

41:26.371 --> 41:28.263
Wait... whoa, hey, whoa!

41:28.273 --> 41:30.532
I need to... still need to get in there.

41:32.610 --> 41:34.769
Sylvia?

41:34.779 --> 41:36.537
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

41:39.216 --> 41:40.474
Alice, what the hell?

41:44.023 --> 41:46.015
Alice, are you working with the Library?

41:46.256 --> 41:48.248
Q, please...

42:01.170 --> 42:02.228
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:03.573 --> 42:05.164
What was that?

42:05.174 --> 42:07.472
It sounded like a dragon barfing.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.395
We gotta get back to
the book chute. Come on.

42:14.119 --> 42:16.070
Holy shit!

42:16.819 --> 42:18.744
Did you... okay.

42:18.754 --> 42:20.579
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.616
Oh, but Penny...

42:23.626 --> 42:25.618
No, we don't have time. I'm sorry.

42:25.628 --> 42:28.086
Shit.
