00:01.168 --> 00:03.535
<i> Previously on</i> Queen Sugar...

00:03.570 --> 00:05.937
I got memories
that I'd left in the past

00:05.972 --> 00:07.739
seeping into my bones again.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.308
You're just insecure,
lying trash who'll never

00:10.343 --> 00:13.645
be more than what she's
always been, irrelevant.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.047
I can get at the real story.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.815
You don't have to do
all this on your own.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.617
My past led me to you,

00:18.652 --> 00:21.920
and that led me to want
to be a better man.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.822
One minute, you were
downing jello shots

00:23.857 --> 00:25.524
before he dragged you
upstairs.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.493
Don't no man have
the right to take
advantage of you.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.062
<i> No means no.</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:33.231
-Am I doing this right?
-[Charley] Come on, smile.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.367
-[camera beeps]
-Mom, be careful
with that thing.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.235
I got the settings
just how I like it.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.071
Hush. I'm doing this.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.773
[Hollywood] Charley,
don't be messing with
the boy's camera.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.543
-Ma, you're not even
holding it right.
-Okay, all right. Fine, fine.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.945
[Hollywood] A young Prince
and Nona Gaye. All right, now.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.614
-[laughter and chattering]
- Who?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.551
I poured sparkling cider so we
can all toast this gorgeous,

00:52.586 --> 00:55.320
smart couple
before they head out.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.524
We celebrate this young queen
and king today,

00:59.559 --> 01:03.028
not only for their beauty,
but also for their brains.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.130
Round of applause
to Keke,

01:05.165 --> 01:07.132
who's going
to my Tulane University,

01:07.167 --> 01:08.500
on a full
visual arts scholarship!

01:08.535 --> 01:10.168
-[all cheer]
-That's right.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.603
Go, Green Wave.

01:11.638 --> 01:12.804
[laughs]

01:12.839 --> 01:14.506
And our dear Micah West,

01:14.541 --> 01:17.375
who's taking his talents
all the way across the country

01:17.410 --> 01:20.145
-to...
-[all] Harvard.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.048
My baby's going
to Harvard.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.483
[Hollywood]
All right, now.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.351
Gonna be like my man,
um, who's always looking

01:26.386 --> 01:28.353
for people's roots
and family trees on TV.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.955
The next Henry Louis Gates.
Yes.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.724
Yeah, well, I think
we've had enough
roots-finding

01:32.759 --> 01:36.027
and done dodged enough trees
to fill a whole forest.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.863
[laughter]

01:37.898 --> 01:39.264
Thank you, Uncle Hollywood.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.233
-Cheers.
-Thank you, Auntie Nova.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.901
[all]
Cheers.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.203
All right, well, we took
enough photos at Keke's house.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.872
Can we go? Yeah?
We're gonna be late.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.207
For which part?
The pre-prom, the prom,

01:49.242 --> 01:51.076
the post-prom,
the prom proposal,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.310
the prom entrances?

01:52.345 --> 01:53.712
I mean,
it's just so much.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.847
Nah, we're just gonna
keep it simple.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.782
We're just linking
with some friends
before we go to the prom.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.818
Couple of us put in
for a hotel suite, so...

01:59.853 --> 02:02.521
Okay, well, ordinarily,
I would say be home by 11:00,

02:02.556 --> 02:06.458
but tonight I'm just
gonna say have a good time.

02:06.493 --> 02:07.559
Thank you.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.596
Here, let me get
in there right quick.
Let me get in there.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.464
Flower.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.099
Prom party
at the hotel, huh?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.168
-[chuckles]
-I remember them days.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.137
Now, all I'm gonna
tell you, brother,
is just be responsible.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.639
-Okay, young blood?
-Yeah, I hear you.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.141
-I hear you. I promise.
-All right.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.543
[Charley]
Hey, here you go.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.111
-Just in case.
-It's fine, Mom.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.412
-Just in case.
-No.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.014
The forecast said
light showers at most.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.183
Plus, we're gonna be inside
most of the night.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.617
Okay.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.352
-I'm good.
-Okay. Have fun.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.887
-Have fun.
-[Micah] Thank you.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.156
-Shall we?
-We shall.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.392
[Vi] Y'all have
a good time.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.694
All right. Bye, Auntie.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.696
[Charley] Turn around,
and give a little wave.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.331
Just over the shoulder.
Just a little wave.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.899
-Gosh.
-Just do it!

02:47.934 --> 02:49.467
[Hollywood] Looking like
a young El DeBarge over there.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.837
-[all laugh]
-Oh, Lord.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.470
I remember
when Micah was a baby,

03:25.505 --> 03:27.772
just holding him
on my shoulder.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.774
He was so tiny.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.610
And now look at him.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.445
He's almost a grown man.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.147
Mm-hmm. You worried about what
he might be doing with Keke.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.550
No, I am not worried
about that.

03:38.585 --> 03:42.420
I raised him to do
the right thing.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.589
And I plan to keep myself
very busy

03:44.624 --> 03:47.392
not worrying about it
with this town hall

03:47.427 --> 03:48.693
to prepare for.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.462
-Sounds like a good plan.
-I just--

03:50.497 --> 03:51.830
I need to be
ready for anything

03:51.865 --> 03:54.466
the Landry-Boudreauxs
throw my way.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.901
The polls have tightened.
I can't take any chances.

03:56.936 --> 04:01.273
Oh, hey, well, the diner
is ready for your walk-through.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.109
You've got the key. If you need
anything, you just call me.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.011
-Thanks, Aunt Vi.
-[Vi] You're welcome, baby.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.759
I know you're worried
about the polls.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.228
I didn't want to share this
when we weren't speaking,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.263
but now...

04:25.298 --> 04:26.798
What is it?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.667
I learned something
on my book tour

04:28.702 --> 04:30.368
that I think you should know.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.604
I figured it's something
you could use at the debate

04:32.639 --> 04:35.040
to keep Jacob
off balance.

04:35.075 --> 04:39.044
Just in case you need more...
ammunition.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.685
[Deesha]
Cold and freshly made.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.953
Ah. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.989
And you, of course.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.727
-Joie!
-Whoa! Ahh. Whoa, now.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.662
Joie Sonnier,
where are your manners?

04:57.697 --> 05:00.598
You didn't even speak
to Mr. Bordelon when he came in.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.734
Hello, Mr. Ralph Angel.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.202
And?

05:04.237 --> 05:05.670
-And thanks.
-Mm-mm.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.372
Thank you
for bringing Blue over.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.541
You are very welcome,
Miss Joie.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.444
Joie, you have to see
the spaceship Pops got.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.513
It has flames painted
on the wings and everything.

05:15.548 --> 05:16.982
Oh, it's right there.

05:21.187 --> 05:24.622
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for missing our last date.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.591
I should have
just been real with you

05:26.626 --> 05:28.360
about what's going on.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.463
Things happen.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.134
But is everything okay?

05:36.169 --> 05:40.205
I mean, it took a playdate with
our kids for me to even see you.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.474
Is there anything
I need to know?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.578
It's just kind of complicated.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.047
Well...

05:51.618 --> 05:55.820
Better get some snacks
before these kids get too antsy.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.989
-[thunder rumbling]

for city council

06:04.831 --> 06:08.400

that's better
for all of us.

06:09.969 --> 06:13.104
Just as St. Jo has made me
a better person,

06:13.139 --> 06:15.173
I hope to give back--"

06:15.208 --> 06:16.975
Don't forget the people
in the side booths.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.176

I-I-I welcome
this opportunity today

06:23.082 --> 06:24.849

06:24.884 --> 06:28.720
and how we can use Prop K
to stop the incoming highway

06:28.755 --> 06:30.488
and fracking industry--"

06:30.523 --> 06:32.590
Miss Bordelon,
Jacob Boudreaux was born here,

06:32.625 --> 06:34.726
raised here.
Why should we trust you?

06:34.761 --> 06:37.629
A carpetbagger basketball wife
from Tinseltown?

06:37.664 --> 06:40.031
Wait. What? I'm not--

06:40.066 --> 06:42.100
I know, but if Jacob
throws you off like that

06:42.135 --> 06:44.602
or if you feel like
you're losing the crowd
or the local press,

06:44.637 --> 06:47.272
then you have got to change
the power dynamic.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.873
Turnabout is fair play here.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.109
-Throw him off his game.
-Control the narrative.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.646
Of course.
He's going to attack my past.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.881
My life is an open book now,
right?

06:56.916 --> 07:00.318
But theirs isn't.
Not yet.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.955
This would be the time to use
the info from the lineages book.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.891
It's completely unexpected,
puts them on the defensive,

07:06.926 --> 07:10.395
and shifts the narrative
back in your control.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.165
Are you even sure
that it's accurate?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.668
I mean, it's a lot.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.604
It is, but I went
back to the show

07:19.639 --> 07:21.606
to see the evidence
for myself.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.708
It's legit.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.677
[cell phone buzzes]

07:30.049 --> 07:32.851
Oh, that smile tells me
you just got good news.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.852
Calvin.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.687
He's coming for my birthday.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.656
Belated,
but he's coming anyway.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.192
Well, better late
than never.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.393
Go.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.662
Get home, and freshen up.

-Nova, you're blushing.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.837
-Get out of here.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.405
You're not going
to be able to focus,

07:54.440 --> 07:58.309
and I'll be better on my own
practicing, anyway.

07:58.344 --> 07:59.678
Go.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.015
-[both laugh]
-Girl, get it.

10:13.646 --> 10:14.879
You don't have
to do it like that.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.481
I have to step out
one time, bro.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.683
It's prom, man.
Good to see you.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.087
[indistinct chatter]

10:23.756 --> 10:26.290
-He wasn't ready.
-They weren't ready.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.426
-What's good, Miss Asha?
-Micah, what's good, man?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.794
Yo, what happened to Ant?

10:29.829 --> 10:31.963
I thought he was gonna
ride over with you guys.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.165
Yeah, he called last minute
saying he wasn't really
like, feeling well,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.701
-so he was gonna pass.
-Man.

10:36.736 --> 10:37.869
You know, he probably
didn't feel comfortable

10:37.904 --> 10:39.070
being around
a bunch of people.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.571
We just got to,
you know,

10:40.606 --> 10:42.040
-give him time.
-Right.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.043
Well, I suggest
we raise a toast.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.578
All right, y'all, to Ant.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.648
-And to his future.
-[all] To Ant.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.817
Oof. Mm.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.352
Okay, I definitely
didn't need...

10:54.387 --> 10:56.354
-That's something.
-We should hold up on that

10:56.389 --> 10:57.655
until the after-party.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.557
We at least want
to walk into prom sober.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.858
What's the fun of that?

11:00.893 --> 11:02.894
So speaking
of the after-party...

11:02.929 --> 11:04.996
so there was a little mix-up
when I went to check in.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.598
You know, Micah, Malik.
Malik, Micah.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.300
Now, I'm not saying who,

11:09.335 --> 11:11.335
but it seems like
somebody in this room

11:11.370 --> 11:13.971
booked themselves a private room
down the hall.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.773
I'm assuming for later.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.675
-No, that's not--
-[boys laugh]

11:17.710 --> 11:19.010
No, I just got that one

11:19.045 --> 11:20.778
just in case we couldn't
get this one.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.947
-Yeah, okay. Right.
-[Micah] Shut up, man.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.049
Davis West's name cuts through
a lot of red tape.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.552
-Red tape? I get you.
-Red tape? Red tape.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.087
My fault, yeah.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.688
I just forgot to cancel it.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.092
-Whatever you say.
-Okay, cool.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.861
Y'all saw that?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.899
Whoa.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.768
[thunder crashing]

11:46.038 --> 11:47.538
-What is going--
-[electricity hums]

11:47.573 --> 11:49.074
Great.

11:52.411 --> 11:56.814
"My opponent would
take our land, build a highway,

11:56.849 --> 11:58.516
and decimate our farms

11:58.551 --> 12:01.786
in order to support
fracking operations

12:01.821 --> 12:04.689
that will only build wealth
for a chosen few.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.358
But together,
we can create a future."

12:10.696 --> 12:13.498
Well done, Charley.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.335
Resorting to spying, Jacob.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.172
Your prep walk-through is
scheduled for tomorrow morning.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.473
This is my time.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.408
I know.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.110
I wanted
to talk to you,

12:26.145 --> 12:28.212
but you've ducked
my calls.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.549
Because I don't want
to talk to you.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.118
We're competitors.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.154
To say we're competitors

12:36.189 --> 12:38.289
would mean either one of us
could win this thing.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.892
But the truth is,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.394
you don't have
a chance to win.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.263
At all.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.431
I'm sorry.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.201
You think you've
got it in the bag?

12:50.236 --> 12:51.736
Charley, I've been told
it's a done deal

12:51.771 --> 12:53.404
and that I've already won.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.809
But I want to urge you
to get out before it's too late.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.178
The arrogance
of mediocre white men

13:00.213 --> 13:02.814
never ceases
to astound me.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.383
It's not arrogance,
Charley.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.751
It's power.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.186
I told you,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.955
my family stops at nothing
that gets in their way.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.496
My mother, for some reason,
is suddenly livid with you.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.465
-I'll bet she is.
-Believe it or not,

13:21.500 --> 13:24.969
everything that's happened
'til now is just business.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.772
But she and the people
she's working with,

13:27.807 --> 13:30.575
they intend to destroy you
and your family...

13:30.610 --> 13:32.243
completely.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.745
Now it's gotten personal.

13:34.780 --> 13:38.049
<i> Now</i> it's gotten
personal?

13:40.519 --> 13:42.253
I've heard enough.

13:42.288 --> 13:46.090
Your attempts at intimidation
are weak,

13:46.125 --> 13:49.894
and I have got better things
to do with my time.

Not a single forecaster said
nothing about a flash flood.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.258
Your car almost
floated off the road.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.727
Can't nobody tell me
global warming ain't real, man,

14:22.762 --> 14:25.596
all that craziness out there.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.431
It wasn't like this
when we was kids, you know.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.368
I hope that my gloves
didn't get wet.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.371
All that stuff
for that motorcycle of yours?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.039
Mm-hmm. You know
I wanted to ride today

14:35.074 --> 14:36.974
They got all wet.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.876
Now, I got you
a helmet in here.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.611
I hope you saved
your receipt.

14:40.646 --> 14:44.115

on that road before long,

wrapped around me,

in your face.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.021
Don't that sound nice?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.789
That's a bet you gonna lose,

14:51.824 --> 14:53.824
'cause, like I told you,
I ain't getting on that thing.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.360
Baby, you ain't no fun.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.663
I ain't no fun?
That's how you feel?

Baby, you know I'm just
playing around. I'm sorry--

a little quiet.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.361

16:04.330 --> 16:06.364
Just got a lot
on my mind.

I'm not mad or nothing.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.540
You want to dance?

16:17.043 --> 16:18.342
What?

16:18.377 --> 16:21.078
I mean, since
it's looking doubtful

16:21.113 --> 16:24.281
we'll get out of here safely,

I just kept it as a surprise.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.561
I know we made plans,
but...

17:12.131 --> 17:14.065
I didn't want
to assume anything.

I didn't want you
to feel pressure.

I didn't want to be unprepared,
though, so I just got it--

17:20.940 --> 17:22.740
It's okay, Micah.

17:26.745 --> 17:29.313
I didn't want
to be unprepared, either.

I ain't been all the way

What?

22:34.119 --> 22:35.486
Look at us.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.021
I mean, we've never
been like this.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.157
Domestic...

22:40.192 --> 22:41.525
together.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.661
Yeah, guess you're right.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.497
We never had the time.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.299
Or the freedom.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.668
This is good.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.371
And that chicken
looks amazing.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.440
You really are
good at this.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.308
And you're
a good sous-chef.

22:58.343 --> 23:01.345
-Oh, I think I'm head chef here.
-Too many cooks, baby.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.680
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Please, sit.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.150
-[laughing]
-I will be doing the serving.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.893
How about we do this
more often?

23:17.262 --> 23:18.696
Like next weekend.

23:20.699 --> 23:23.167
I would love to,
but I have the kids next week.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.369
I'm taking 'em camping.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.937
How 'bout the week after?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.272
Can't.

23:28.307 --> 23:32.476
I'm hosting a writing workshop
back in Atlanta.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.779
And then you've got
the kids again, right?

23:35.814 --> 23:38.148
It's my two-week vacation
with them.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.117
-[cork pops
-[laughs]

23:42.154 --> 23:45.155
So that's four or five weeks

23:45.190 --> 23:47.558
before we see each other again?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.066
Look, Charley,

23:56.101 --> 23:58.202
I know who I am,
where I come from.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.103
I know how I was raised.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.472
Do you?

24:03.842 --> 24:05.543
Really?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.289
[Frances, on recording]
<i> You don't get to</i>
<i> question me, gal.</i>

24:19.324 --> 24:20.958
<i> I do love this land.</i>

24:20.993 --> 24:23.427
<i> What I love most</i>
<i> is that sugar cane.</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:25.128
<i> After it's washed,</i>
<i> processed,</i>

24:25.163 --> 24:27.598
<i> and all the impurities</i>
<i> are squeezed out of it,</i>

24:27.633 --> 24:29.833
<i> it comes forth</i>
<i> as white as snow,</i>

24:29.868 --> 24:31.435
<i> the way it should be.</i>

24:31.470 --> 24:32.736
What...

24:32.771 --> 24:34.438
<i> You needed to be put</i>

24:34.473 --> 24:37.474
<i> You're nothing more</i>

24:39.111 --> 24:41.345
<i> But I guess</i>

24:41.380 --> 24:43.214
[thunder rumbles]

24:48.320 --> 24:49.920
That's your mama, Jacob.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.992
Still want to talk
about how you were raised?

25:01.466 --> 25:03.534
You know the difference

25:03.569 --> 25:05.803
between you and me?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.542
I know my shame.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.180
I've dealt
with my issues.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.149
But, Jacob...

25:20.385 --> 25:24.021
despite the evidence
of all of American history...

25:26.592 --> 25:28.025
your history...

25:30.062 --> 25:32.296
you can't even
acknowledge that...

25:34.666 --> 25:38.702
your issues around whiteness
even exist.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.543
How could I be better?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.116
Drop out of the race.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.052
I can't do that.
I want to.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.787
I don't even want
to be a councilman,

25:56.822 --> 25:58.355
but it's too late
for that now.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.059
Wow, so there's-- there's
nothing that you can do?

26:02.094 --> 26:03.961
I can promise to work with you
once I'm in office.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.664
No. No, that is
not good enough.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.266
Do better.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.572
I can't just drop out
of the race.

26:15.874 --> 26:19.209
But maybe I can find a way
to make myself unelectable,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.879
you know, throw the race.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.919
I think I can help you
with that.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.263
What are you doing
with a picture

26:40.298 --> 26:42.733
of my great-grandmother
Landry?

26:47.205 --> 26:48.572
Oh.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.174
God bless the rain.

26:52.177 --> 26:55.145
-Oh, we needed this, baby.
-Mm-hmm.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.980
No diner, no family.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.348
Just us.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.017
Shoot, I don't even remember

27:00.052 --> 27:01.952
the last time
I was this relaxed.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.620
See?

27:03.655 --> 27:06.690
You guys make fun
of us ladies

27:06.725 --> 27:10.060
for going for our spas
and massages.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.264
You need a little bit
of self-care yourself.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.099
You ain't got
to convince me, baby.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.268
It's them other Joes
you talking about.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.971
I wonder if I could
convince them, though.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.673
I been hearing
about these places

27:22.708 --> 27:24.508
popping up
around the country.

27:24.543 --> 27:28.445
Black men just coming together,
sitting around,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.980
talking,

27:30.015 --> 27:32.115
giving each other advice.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.052
Lift each other up
when times get tough.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.586
Now, that's something
I could get down with.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.021
Ah, a support group?

27:38.056 --> 27:39.723
Nah, I can't call it that,
though.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.324
[both laugh]

27:41.359 --> 27:43.026
Thinking about calling it
"The Hangout."

27:43.061 --> 27:46.863
That sounds like a place
where folks get arrested.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.165
-You can do better.
-Okay.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.900
Well, what about--
what about...

27:49.935 --> 27:53.670
the St. Jo's Men's Social Club?

27:53.705 --> 27:56.406
Well, you told me
that I'm the only one

27:56.441 --> 27:59.609
where you feel like you could
talk to about the real stuff.

27:59.644 --> 28:01.178
Right?

28:01.213 --> 28:02.879
Well, if that's what you want
for this place,

28:02.914 --> 28:04.548
well, I don't know,

28:04.583 --> 28:07.884
maybe call it "The Real Stuff."

28:07.919 --> 28:12.422
Well, what about
"The Real Spot"?

28:12.457 --> 28:14.391
There it is. I like that.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.094
-[Hollywood] The Real Spot.
-[Violet] Yeah.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.466
[thunder rumbling]

28:22.501 --> 28:23.667
Thank you.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.168
Hey.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.505
You didn't have to do that
in all this rain.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.340
It's all good.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.676
Just wanted to see
how you getting through today.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.044
Like you did
the day before last

28:34.079 --> 28:36.513
and the day before that.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.184
Got you some chicken soup before
the rain shuts stuff down.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.220
That kind you like
from Poppa Joe's.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.255
Yeah.

28:46.324 --> 28:47.591
How you feeling?

28:47.626 --> 28:49.326
I took some time
off of work.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.195
I called Marlene.

28:52.230 --> 28:56.466
I'm trying to send her
my actions right now

28:56.501 --> 28:59.102
and not my feelings.

28:59.137 --> 29:00.938
That's what's up.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.341
Yeah, that's what's up.

29:05.577 --> 29:06.910
[sighs]

29:08.580 --> 29:11.014
Blue been wondering
about you.

29:12.217 --> 29:13.884
Told him you ain't
been feeling too good

29:13.919 --> 29:16.787
so you went down
to your mama's.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.227
Look, Darla, just...

29:25.263 --> 29:27.397
please don't take too long
before you see him.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.435
I really want
to see him, but, um...

29:34.139 --> 29:37.641
but I just need
a little bit more time

29:37.676 --> 29:41.445
to make sure that I'm in
the right condition to do that.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.921
You know, I was
never really sure

29:50.956 --> 29:53.524
when we were gonna
see each other again.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.494
Didn't bother me
so much then.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.297
[laughs]

30:00.332 --> 30:01.565
But...

30:03.268 --> 30:06.303
to be honest
and tell my radical truth...

30:07.372 --> 30:08.371
that worked for me.

30:08.406 --> 30:10.807
It was painful
to be away from you,

30:10.842 --> 30:13.310
but I convinced myself
it was my choice.

30:13.345 --> 30:19.049
At all times,
I remained in control.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.485
[thunder rumbles]

30:23.121 --> 30:24.955
But I can't say
I was happy.

30:28.293 --> 30:29.893
And now?

30:29.928 --> 30:32.863
One thing about
writing a memoir,

30:32.898 --> 30:36.499
you have to face your fears
if you're gonna be authentic.

30:36.534 --> 30:39.469
I can see now that every
relationship I've ever been in

30:39.504 --> 30:45.308
had a built-in, impenetrable
barrier guarding my heart.

30:45.343 --> 30:49.112
With you, it was your race,

30:49.147 --> 30:52.516
your marriage, your kids...

30:53.618 --> 30:55.252
your job.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.787
And now--

30:57.822 --> 30:59.289
Living in two cities.

31:01.559 --> 31:05.495
Maybe our schedules
are something else.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.934
So you're saying I have
a fear of commitment.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.936
No, I'm saying
you were able to commit

31:12.971 --> 31:14.838
because we had distance.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.273
[scoffs]

31:23.114 --> 31:25.249
What if we didn't
have the distance?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.152
What if we threw caution
out the window?

31:29.187 --> 31:33.023
Maybe our happiness
is on the other side

31:33.058 --> 31:35.292
of what we're
comfortable with.

31:36.995 --> 31:39.263
And out of living
in other people's boxes.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.167
Not even our own.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.671
<i> ¶ Starve my heart of ecstasy ¶</i>

31:47.706 --> 31:49.773
[thunder crashes]

31:49.808 --> 31:54.011
<i> ¶ When you're not</i>
<i> The one in front of me ¶</i>

31:55.880 --> 31:57.814
<i> ¶ So I crave no other ¶</i>

31:57.849 --> 32:01.685
<i> ¶ Said I'm cravin' you ¶</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:07.490
-Okay, Malik, you start.
-[Malik] All right.

32:07.525 --> 32:11.127
Where do I see myself
10, 20 years from now?

32:11.162 --> 32:13.430
Well, by then,
I'll have at least five Grammys.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.899
-[Asha] Five?
-Mm-hmm. Go big, or go home.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.434
That's what I always say.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.235
-Since when?
-[Malik] Since right now.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.973
I'm gonna be
living bicoastal,

32:23.008 --> 32:24.708
producing albums
for all the top artists,

32:24.743 --> 32:28.244
and all just dying
for that Strickland sound, brah.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.779
That Strickland sound.

32:29.814 --> 32:31.114
That actually sounds dope.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.516
-Yeah, it does.
-What about you?

32:33.551 --> 32:36.753
I plan to have a whole chain
of urgent care clinics

32:36.788 --> 32:38.121
all throughout Louisiana,

32:38.156 --> 32:40.156
just offering
low-cost healthcare

32:40.191 --> 32:43.693
to those who can least
afford to pay.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.061
That's awesome, Asha.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.463
And you're gonna do it.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.564
[all]
Yeah.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.100
And the slogan
posted in all my offices

32:50.135 --> 32:52.535
is gonna be,
"Do no harm..."

32:52.570 --> 32:53.937
[all]
"...But take no shit."

32:53.972 --> 32:55.805
Y'all already know.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.408
And when them whack-ass
insurance companies
try to shut you down,

32:58.443 --> 33:00.643
I can defend you
with my law firm.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.946
Oh, so you're finally going
to put that big mouth to--

33:02.981 --> 33:06.349
-I mean, that big voice to use?
-All right, whatever.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.151
Wow.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.386
-Right.
-But, yeah.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.254
I plan to start a bail bond

33:11.289 --> 33:13.289
for all our brothers
and sisters, you know,

33:13.324 --> 33:16.393
the ones locked up
for months or years pretrial

33:16.428 --> 33:18.795
because they can't, what,
come up with a hundred

33:18.830 --> 33:20.263
or a couple thousand dollars?

33:20.298 --> 33:21.765
-[Asha] Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.801
Think of it like
an Innocence Project and ACLU

33:24.836 --> 33:27.203
-all wrapped in one.
-[Micah] Wow, I respect that.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.039
[Keke]
Well, in ten years,

33:29.074 --> 33:31.007
I will be flying to New York

33:31.042 --> 33:33.977
to present my latest
art installation

33:34.012 --> 33:36.513
right before I jet off to D.C.

33:36.548 --> 33:39.315
to unveil
my commissioned collection

33:39.350 --> 33:41.384
in the African-American Museum.

33:41.419 --> 33:42.786
Okay.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.355
That's what's up.
That's what's up.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.491
Well, how about you, Micah?

33:52.897 --> 33:54.431
I don't know.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.568
I don't know. I'm...

34:01.439 --> 34:03.973
I mean, I guess I'm...

34:04.008 --> 34:06.676
liking my photography
more and more.

34:07.745 --> 34:10.313
I hear a "but" coming.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.783
-But, uh...
-There you go.

34:14.419 --> 34:16.719
I don't know. I feel like,
when it's all said and done,

34:16.754 --> 34:18.788
I'll be doing
something respectable,

34:18.823 --> 34:23.326
like investment banking
or hedge funds.

34:23.361 --> 34:25.395
-Hmm.
-All right.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.101
I've made up my mind
about something,

34:31.136 --> 34:33.303
and I hope
you like it.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.640
Now I'm curious.

34:37.675 --> 34:38.809
What is it?

34:39.611 --> 34:41.545
I'm moving back
to New Orleans.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.548
I would much rather commute
to work in Baton Rouge,

34:45.583 --> 34:47.851
if that allows us
to have something real.

34:50.221 --> 34:53.756
I don't want any more
strange looks from your family,

34:53.791 --> 34:56.126
whether or not
I'm that married cop

34:56.161 --> 34:57.661
who played around
on his wife.

34:59.797 --> 35:02.332
That guy in your book,
I'm not that guy.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.538
Sounds nice.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.708
Like a dream.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.177
It could be real.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.514
Say yes.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.815
To what?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.450
To us.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.354
To happiness.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.304
This soup hitting,
ain't it?

35:41.339 --> 35:43.206
And it's the perfect day
for it.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.074
Mm-hmm.

35:45.109 --> 35:46.309
[sighs]

35:46.344 --> 35:48.044
Thank you, Ralph Angel,

35:48.079 --> 35:49.880
for keeping me company.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.316
I know you didn't have to.

36:07.765 --> 36:09.299
It's all good.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.669
[sighs]

36:15.006 --> 36:16.940
[thunder crashing]

36:29.287 --> 36:31.788
You don't owe me
anything.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.723
I know that.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.792
But I...

36:35.827 --> 36:37.727
I would like to know...

36:39.230 --> 36:41.198
why do you keep coming?

36:43.901 --> 36:45.501
Just 'cause
we ain't together

36:45.536 --> 36:48.638
don't mean I don't care
about you no more.

36:51.776 --> 36:52.976
I have to.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.380
For my own peace of mind,
really.

36:58.483 --> 36:59.950
What do you mean?

37:02.987 --> 37:05.322
All I could think about...

37:09.060 --> 37:11.995
is them
two piece-of-shit bastards

37:12.030 --> 37:13.863
that hurt you.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.233
Ain't nobody
was there for you then.

37:17.368 --> 37:20.036
I don't ever
want you to feel like

37:20.071 --> 37:22.239
nobody's there for you again.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.941
Keep it a hundred,

37:24.976 --> 37:26.443
relapsing...

37:27.779 --> 37:30.580
man, it scared the hell
out of me, Darla,

37:30.615 --> 37:31.848
a lot.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.452
For Blue. Yeah.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.290
For me, too.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.626
[sighs]

37:44.529 --> 37:46.529
It scared me, too.

37:46.564 --> 37:49.399
I ain't felt like that since...

37:49.434 --> 37:51.868
since we first
got together...

37:54.405 --> 37:55.905
before we had Blue.

37:57.642 --> 38:02.445
Man, I spent so much time
just worrying about you.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.281
"Did she make it
in her dorm okay?"

38:05.316 --> 38:07.684
"Hope she had
a good breakfast."

38:09.454 --> 38:11.421
Stupid stuff like that.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.091
It's not stupid.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.593
It's sweet.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.296
Thing is,

38:20.331 --> 38:21.665
nobody tell you...

38:22.867 --> 38:27.437
that loving somebody
could hurt so much.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.740
Always terrified

38:30.775 --> 38:33.443
of losing all the things
you prayed for.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.847
I prayed for you.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.483
I still do.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.754
I pray that...

38:46.157 --> 38:48.291
you could forgive me
one day.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.493
I already told you, I do.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.996
I mean it.

38:54.031 --> 38:55.398
I mean...

38:56.267 --> 38:58.401
really forgive me.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.971
-Forgive me enough to go back...
-[sighs]

39:04.242 --> 39:06.343
to what we had before.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.893
Think you could
ever think about...

39:25.930 --> 39:27.497
us again?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.768
I always do.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.072
I don't think
I never really stopped.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.878
Thanks again for that info.

39:41.913 --> 39:46.182
I think it's going to work in
ways we couldn't have imagined.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.383
Turn on the news.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.385
[types]

39:49.420 --> 39:52.922
<i> It's come to my attention</i>
<i> that Landry Enterprises</i>

39:52.957 --> 39:55.792
<i> has a biased pricing structure</i>
<i> based on race.</i>

39:55.827 --> 39:57.527
<i> That is unacceptable to me.</i>

39:57.562 --> 40:01.230
<i> In order to be a better</i>
<i> candidate for all of St. Jo,</i>

40:01.265 --> 40:02.899
<i> I know I must own</i>
<i> my responsibility</i>

40:02.934 --> 40:05.101
<i> in how things have been done.</i>

40:05.136 --> 40:07.303
<i> That is why I pulled out</i>
<i> of tonight's town hall</i>

40:07.338 --> 40:10.239
<i> and instead have ordered</i>
<i> an immediate audit</i>

40:10.274 --> 40:12.408
<i> to overhaul</i>
<i> the pricing structure</i>

40:12.443 --> 40:14.110
<i> at Landry Enterprises.</i>

40:14.145 --> 40:17.413
<i> Enough talk.</i>
<i> It's time for action.</i>

40:17.448 --> 40:18.815
What is th--

40:18.850 --> 40:20.049
Wait for it.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.584
<i> Recently I have</i>
<i> received information</i>

40:21.619 --> 40:24.253
<i> that has impacted me</i>
<i> to my core.</i>

40:24.288 --> 40:26.422
<i> I share it with you today,</i>

40:26.457 --> 40:28.724
<i> because I believe</i>
<i> all of us in St. Jo</i>

40:28.759 --> 40:31.394
<i> should see each other</i>
<i> as one big family.</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:33.896
<i> I have learned</i>
<i> my great-grandmother Landry</i>

40:33.931 --> 40:36.632
<i> was a proud</i>
<i> African-American woman.</i>

40:36.667 --> 40:38.935
<i> She was, in fact,</i>

40:38.970 --> 40:41.404
<i> secretly a member</i>
<i> of the Bordelon family.</i>

40:41.439 --> 40:45.875
<i> I never expected this,</i>
<i> but I wish to say publicly,</i>

40:45.910 --> 40:49.278
<i> I embrace the diversity</i>
<i> of my heritage.</i>

40:49.313 --> 40:53.583
<i> Going forward,</i>
<i> my goal is to educate myself</i>

40:53.618 --> 40:55.251
<i> on the histories</i>
<i> between our communities</i>

40:55.286 --> 40:57.854
<i> and use that knowledge</i>
<i> to be an ally</i>

40:57.889 --> 41:01.324
<i> and support real change</i>
<i> in St. Jo.</i>

41:01.359 --> 41:02.758
<i> Thank you.</i>

41:02.793 --> 41:04.527
[Nova]<i> Now,</i>
<i> that's a bold move,</i>

41:04.562 --> 41:06.662
but this won't
win him more votes?

41:06.697 --> 41:09.265
If we play this right,
he'll lose 10%,

41:09.300 --> 41:12.034
maybe 15% of his white voters,

41:12.069 --> 41:13.936
the ones who are
blatantly racist.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.707
<i> And the small percentage</i>
<i> of black supporters he has</i>

41:17.742 --> 41:19.709
will reconsider their support
once they start to feel

41:19.744 --> 41:23.613
he's pandering
his newfound ethnicity.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.414
<i> And that should be enough</i>

41:25.449 --> 41:27.550
to tip the race
in my favor.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.452
It's bold, Charley,

41:29.487 --> 41:30.753
Risky,

41:30.788 --> 41:32.855
<i> for you and Jacob.</i>

41:32.890 --> 41:34.891
The Landrys,
the Boudreauxs,

41:34.926 --> 41:36.792
and whomever else they're
working with behind the scenes,

41:36.827 --> 41:40.497
I don't think they handle losing
very well.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.065
Yeah, well...

41:43.100 --> 41:44.734
neither do I.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.943
[woman]
<i> Go, Ree-Ree.</i>
