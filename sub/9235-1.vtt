00:27.260 --> 00:29.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:29.629 --> 00:33.224
Yeah. Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick

00:33.266 --> 00:36.133
Nickelodeon.

00:48.782 --> 00:52.013
Mm-hmm.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.317
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:55.355 --> 00:57.789
Give it, give it

00:57.824 --> 00:59.519
Yeah, yeah

01:24.551 --> 01:26.610
Whoo, yeah, yeah

01:26.653 --> 01:29.383
It's Harriet the spy

01:29.422 --> 01:30.889
Spies look at the eye

01:30.924 --> 01:32.983
Now there she go
like looking at

01:33.059 --> 01:37.519
Say why, hi, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my

01:37.564 --> 01:40.533
Dig it, dig it, yeah

01:40.567 --> 01:43.229
There she,
there she go, go, go

01:48.374 --> 01:50.274
There she go now

01:50.310 --> 01:51.868
Look at the spy

01:51.911 --> 01:54.402
Hey, watch her, watch her,
watch her

01:54.447 --> 01:55.709
She's a spy, my, my

01:55.748 --> 01:56.806
Dig it, dig it

02:27.747 --> 02:29.874
Oh, yeah

02:32.118 --> 02:34.382
She's lookin'
in your eye, eye

02:34.420 --> 02:37.321
Why? I don't know

03:11.524 --> 03:14.084
Whoa, yeah.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.640
Boy with ringlets.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.371
Man with tattoos.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.252
Girl on...

03:40.286 --> 03:42.948
a leash?

03:42.989 --> 03:44.923
Man, if my parents ever tried

03:44.958 --> 03:47.984
putting me in one
of those things,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.756
I'd trade them in.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.492
This kid looks like
she can roll over and fetch.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.691
I learn everything I can

03:55.735 --> 03:57.896
and I write down
everything I see.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.167
Golly says if I want
to be a writer

04:00.206 --> 04:01.935
then I'd better start now.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.442
Which is why I am a spy.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.112
Lady with a purse.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.124
Man with...

04:19.158 --> 04:21.752
her wallet.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.386
Oh, help!

04:23.429 --> 04:25.158
Please!

04:27.433 --> 04:28.422
Stop him!

04:28.468 --> 04:29.867
Stop him!

04:42.782 --> 04:45.080
Quack

04:45.118 --> 04:47.143
Quack, quack

04:47.186 --> 04:48.653
Quack

04:48.688 --> 04:51.316
Quack, quack

04:51.357 --> 04:53.723
And... done.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.497
What is it?

04:59.532 --> 05:00.499
It's Nanomichi.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.626
You know, the god
of storm and thunder.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.603
- Cool, huh?
- Okay, come on, hurry up

05:04.637 --> 05:05.604
before it dries.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.605
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.129
Okay, ready?

05:08.174 --> 05:09.436
Here, give me
your foot.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.942
The secret tattoo.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.877
My best friends Sport,
Janie and I thought

05:13.913 --> 05:15.778
we should be blood buddies.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.181
But this was so much
less painful.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.684
Just remember the rule.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.714
If anyone sees
the secret tattoo...

05:25.758 --> 05:28.192
...swift and painful death.

05:37.804 --> 05:41.035
It's... starting.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.576
Here comes...

05:45.611 --> 05:49.980
nice Marion Hawthorne.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.311
It's happening.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.444
I can feel it happening.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.885
Good Lord.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.946
It's the dreaded
Hawthorne effect.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.389
Oh.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.922
Good morning, Janie, Simon...

06:08.000 --> 06:09.900
and Harriet.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.329
Harri... et!

06:13.373 --> 06:16.240
I got to get to class.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.072
See ya.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.170
See you guys in a few.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.977
Sixth grade.

06:26.486 --> 06:31.924
All the usual suspects
are back in action.

06:31.958 --> 06:35.758
First of all there's
Rachel Hennessy,

06:35.795 --> 06:37.956
Marion's second in command.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.431
The only thing more pathetic
than being Marion Hawthorne

06:41.467 --> 06:44.959
is wanting to be
Marion Hawthorne.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.069
Pinky Whitehead,

06:49.108 --> 06:51.099
the human fish belly.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.510
If Janie's theory is right,
then Pinky's DNA

06:53.546 --> 06:56.379
was combined with a pint
of vanilla yogurt at birth.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.010
Carrie Andrews thinks
she's cool...

07:00.653 --> 07:03.087
'cause she spent her summer
vacation growing boobs.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.784
Laura Peters looks like
someone pinched her face

07:08.828 --> 07:11.160
and it stuck that way.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.631
The boy with purple socks.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.759
A man of mystery.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.736
He never talks.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.933
If I were known
only by my footwear,

07:20.973 --> 07:22.907
I'd hang myself.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.673
Beth Ellen Hansen always looks
like she's about to cry.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.078
I wish someone
would just kick her

07:29.115 --> 07:30.605
and get it over with.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.083
And then of course,
there's our teacher...

07:35.121 --> 07:36.554
Miss Elson.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.853
She's nice, and polite.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.587
I bet one day she goes
on a psycho killing spree,

07:41.627 --> 07:43.390
and all her neighbors
will say...

07:43.429 --> 07:45.420
"She was nice and polite."

07:45.465 --> 07:49.299
Well, from what your last
two teachers tell me,

07:49.335 --> 07:52.202
it looks like
dÃ©ja vu all over again.

07:57.043 --> 08:01.377
It's time to vote for
a sixth grade class president.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.316
And for the third year
in a row...

08:05.351 --> 08:08.445
we're down to our final
two nominees,

08:08.488 --> 08:12.185
and they are Harriet Welsch

08:12.225 --> 08:15.285
and Marion Hawthorne.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.059
And so, as you may know,

08:19.098 --> 08:22.033
the duties of the class
president include

08:22.068 --> 08:26.402
taking attendance,
reporting bad behavior

08:26.439 --> 08:32.707
and best of all, editing
the sixth grade newspaper.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.245
And now we vote.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.178
Marion Hawthorne... again.

08:42.221 --> 08:45.054
Three years in a row.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.458
You know what?
I think I'll invent a poison.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.483
A really good,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.656
clean, untraceable poison.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.164
One that fries your brains

08:53.199 --> 08:55.667
and makes all your bodily
fluids boil at once.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.963
- Could you?
- Check it out.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.401
One day I'd be like,
"Oh, hi, Marion.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.429
"Oh, no, I'm not
finishing this soda."

09:01.474 --> 09:02.634
And she'd be like...

09:09.181 --> 09:11.115
I'm serious.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.777
Any of you guys
want to come over?

09:12.818 --> 09:13.876
I got to get home.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.751
If my amoebas start
incubating,

09:15.788 --> 09:17.619
they really stink up the house.

09:17.657 --> 09:18.783
Harriet?

09:18.824 --> 09:20.792
Sorry. Spy time.

09:53.058 --> 09:55.322
Spy route.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.191
Harrison Withers' place.

09:57.228 --> 09:59.389
Higher altitude, lower risk.

09:59.431 --> 10:00.830
But always a show.

10:05.170 --> 10:09.163
Yeah, everybody's gonna have
some grease today...

10:09.207 --> 10:14.509
All right, now, Jelly Roll.
Yeah.

10:14.546 --> 10:17.071
Lady Day

10:17.115 --> 10:20.573
Come what may,
whatever you say

10:20.618 --> 10:22.483
We all gonna have
a good time

10:22.520 --> 10:24.681
A little bit
for you, Satchmo

10:24.723 --> 10:26.213
You, Bessie

10:26.257 --> 10:28.657
And how 'bout you,
Jelly Roll?

10:28.693 --> 10:31.924
Golly says, people
who love work love life.

10:31.963 --> 10:33.123
Dizzy, Dizzy

10:33.164 --> 10:34.995
I like Harrison Withers,

10:35.066 --> 10:37.728
'cause he's a guy
that loves both.

10:37.769 --> 10:39.828
Scooby dah...

10:39.871 --> 10:41.702
Scooby-dooby, du-day

10:41.740 --> 10:43.970
Okay, that's it.

10:48.113 --> 10:50.013
Curiously, Harrison lives

10:50.048 --> 10:51.640
for his cats.

10:51.683 --> 10:53.913
Wow! Birdland.

10:56.388 --> 10:58.879
But his work is for the birds.

11:01.993 --> 11:04.154
Charlie Parker.

11:04.195 --> 11:06.755
Yardbird.

11:06.798 --> 11:10.700
In any case, his cages
are the most beautiful

11:10.735 --> 11:12.066
I've ever seen.

11:43.234 --> 11:44.496
It's him.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.004
The Health Department
has it in for Harrison,

11:47.105 --> 11:49.266
'cause they say he's got
too many cats.

11:50.341 --> 11:52.002
I know, I know.

11:52.077 --> 11:56.138
Too bad for them,
Harrison has a system.

11:56.181 --> 11:58.775
See a hat, don't be home.

11:58.817 --> 12:02.048
No hat, no problem.

12:04.656 --> 12:08.114
Another score for the cat fan.

12:19.504 --> 12:20.869
Hey.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.964
Hey.

12:23.007 --> 12:24.372
Want some necklace?

12:24.409 --> 12:26.639
How about you, man?

12:26.678 --> 12:28.908
Ew. You got it all spitty.

12:28.947 --> 12:30.778
Tastes better that way.

12:30.815 --> 12:31.975
Good.

12:32.016 --> 12:33.984
Hey, Harriet,
what are you writing?

12:34.018 --> 12:35.144
Notes.

12:35.186 --> 12:36.483
Can we read them?

12:36.521 --> 12:38.648
Can you read this?

12:38.690 --> 12:39.657
Okay, okay.

12:39.691 --> 12:40.680
I just wanted to know

12:40.725 --> 12:42.625
why you're always
writing like a maniac.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.651
I want to remember everything.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.425
I want to know everything.

12:46.464 --> 12:47.863
Well, you must realize, Harriet,

12:47.899 --> 12:49.890
knowing everything
won't do you a bit of good

12:49.934 --> 12:51.993
unless you use it to put
beauty in this world.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.264
True or false?

12:53.304 --> 12:53.998
True.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.005
Of course it is.

12:55.039 --> 12:56.438
Harriet, your mother called.

12:56.474 --> 12:57.634
She's going to be late.

12:57.675 --> 12:58.801
Come on, Sport, Janie.

12:58.843 --> 13:00.470
I'll have you home
before dinner.

13:00.512 --> 13:02.377
Golly always takes us places.

13:02.413 --> 13:05.382
She sees things
other people barely notice.

13:05.416 --> 13:09.853
She's my nanny and...
well, she's Golly.

13:09.888 --> 13:11.446
Okay, survey of the day.

13:11.489 --> 13:12.888
Today's question is:

13:12.924 --> 13:14.824
What wouldn't you eat
for a million dollars?

13:14.859 --> 13:16.759
Bratwurst.

13:16.794 --> 13:17.761
Sport?

13:17.795 --> 13:21.128
Um... camel boogers,
dried roadkill,

13:21.166 --> 13:22.929
and my dad's meatloaf.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.127
Janie?

13:27.238 --> 13:30.833
It's the last day of summer.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.900
Sad but true.

13:32.944 --> 13:35.310
Au revoir, monsieur soleil.

13:35.346 --> 13:36.973
Farewell!

13:37.048 --> 13:37.980
So long, bye-bye.

13:38.049 --> 13:38.981
Sayonara!

13:39.050 --> 13:41.314
- Good-bye...
- We're here.

13:46.658 --> 13:47.989
Is this a garden?

13:48.059 --> 13:48.991
What a place!

13:49.060 --> 13:49.992
What is this?

13:50.061 --> 13:51.221
Golly, what's that?

13:51.262 --> 13:54.254
That's Mrs. W.,
a very good friend of mine.

13:54.299 --> 13:55.561
Kind of unusual.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.568
You know, there are as many ways
to live

13:57.602 --> 13:59.001
as there are people
in this world.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.470
And each one
deserves a closer look.

14:01.506 --> 14:03.337
Welcome!

14:03.374 --> 14:04.568
Come on in.

14:04.609 --> 14:05.576
Hi.

14:05.610 --> 14:06.577
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:06.611 --> 14:07.839
Hi.

14:07.879 --> 14:09.938
Look around.

14:10.014 --> 14:11.709
Have fun.

14:13.451 --> 14:15.419
Whoa! Awesome!

14:23.261 --> 14:24.319
Bop, bop, bop, bop!

14:32.837 --> 14:34.634
Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat

14:34.672 --> 14:36.037
I'm goin'!

14:41.779 --> 14:44.179
Ooh.

14:57.695 --> 14:58.627
I'm goin'!

15:05.503 --> 15:06.595
Hey, you guys...

15:06.638 --> 15:09.129
what do you say
I propose a toast?

15:09.173 --> 15:11.607
Come on.

15:14.946 --> 15:16.709
Oh... go away.

15:16.748 --> 15:18.716
Say it quick, before
it stops fizzing.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.241
Shake it up, take a sip,
and wish for what you want

15:21.286 --> 15:22.253
most in the world.

15:22.287 --> 15:23.754
Okay.

15:23.788 --> 15:26.154
I want to replicate
my own DNA

15:26.190 --> 15:27.919
and win
the Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah.

15:29.661 --> 15:30.628
Oh!

15:30.662 --> 15:31.788
Very good, Janie.

15:31.829 --> 15:32.853
Okay, shake it up, Sport.

15:32.897 --> 15:33.886
Shake it up.

15:33.931 --> 15:35.523
I want to play
more baseball games

15:35.566 --> 15:36.658
than Cal Ripkin, Jr.

15:36.701 --> 15:37.998
Oh, yeah!

15:38.936 --> 15:41.097
And get filthy rich doing it.

15:41.139 --> 15:42.128
Oh, yeah!

15:42.173 --> 15:44.971
Shake it, Harriet.

15:45.076 --> 15:46.634
I want to see the whole world

15:46.678 --> 15:48.669
and I want to write down
everything.

15:57.455 --> 15:58.717
Harriet, slow down.

15:58.756 --> 16:01.316
That's very impressive.

16:01.359 --> 16:02.553
Harriet?

16:03.628 --> 16:04.595
I'm goin'!

16:04.629 --> 16:05.721
That's good, Harriet.

16:05.763 --> 16:07.128
That's very pretty,
isn't it, Janie?

16:07.165 --> 16:08.154
Yes, I like it.

16:10.401 --> 16:11.663
Got you!

16:31.356 --> 16:33.119
Hey, wait up.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.757
Everybody, hello!
It sucks, sixth grade!

16:38.797 --> 16:40.162
Feet off the bed, please.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.894
Okay.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.294
Feet off.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.736
Oh, the heinie bounce.

16:46.772 --> 16:47.739
Good choice.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.240
Very cute, Harriet,
very cute.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.572
The neighbors
will ask me,

16:50.609 --> 16:52.304
"What happened
to Harriet Welsch?"

16:52.344 --> 16:53.311
"I don't know,"
I'll answer.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.312
"Such a shame.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.541
"She disappeared
without a trace.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.709
And she was
so adorable."

16:58.751 --> 17:00.776
How long have you been
with me, Golly?

17:00.819 --> 17:02.343
Since you were born.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.289
11 years and
12,000 tomato sandwiches ago.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.258
And you'll never leave me,
right?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.157
Well, I won't leave you
"leave you," Harriet,

17:09.194 --> 17:11.425
but, you know, one day
you're going to be big enough.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.626
And well... well, big enough
to take care of yourself.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.759
And when that day comes

17:15.800 --> 17:17.530
you won't need me
and I'll be gone.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.127
But you know what?

17:19.171 --> 17:21.138
That day is not today.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.935
And now, it's time for bed.

17:22.974 --> 17:24.738
Are Mom and Dad
tucking me in?

17:24.777 --> 17:25.743
No.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.769
They're at a very fancy party

17:27.813 --> 17:30.873
and I bet they're thinking
about you right now. Really.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.407
Listen, I think I can hear 'em.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.352
Harriet...

17:35.387 --> 17:38.356
listen to everything
Golly says to you.

17:38.390 --> 17:42.383
We're drinking champagne
and eating caviar, Harriet.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.759
Come on.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.094
Let's go to bed.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.598
Who's going to bed?

17:47.633 --> 17:49.191
Uh, you are, tough guy.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.702
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!

17:50.736 --> 17:51.725
Child abuse! Child abuse!

17:51.770 --> 17:53.135
Oh, you think
that's child abuse?

17:53.172 --> 17:54.639
You haven't even...
How about that?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.402
What about that?
What about one of these?

17:58.844 --> 18:01.438
Stand still,
you little booger.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.107
Ugh!

18:05.484 --> 18:07.645
I'm telling you,
just give me the big knife

18:07.686 --> 18:09.051
and this will all be over.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.749
Harriet, dear,
you have taken

18:10.789 --> 18:12.916
a tomato sandwich
to school with you...

18:12.958 --> 18:13.925
With mayonnaise.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.256
...with mayonnaise
every day

18:15.294 --> 18:16.522
for that past five years.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.586
Don't you want
a little variety?

18:17.630 --> 18:18.597
Nope.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.395
Not even cream cheese
with olive?

18:21.433 --> 18:22.491
Yum-yum-yum!

18:22.534 --> 18:25.162
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?

18:25.204 --> 18:27.764
How about the fancy
cucumber kind,

18:27.806 --> 18:29.671
with the crust cut off?

18:29.708 --> 18:33.644
Mom, I can't help it
if I know what I like.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.546
And I know that I like tomato.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.051
After school spy route...

18:50.095 --> 18:52.689
Hong Fat's Food Emporium

19:41.747 --> 19:44.477
Holy cats, a veggie thief.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.746
This must be investigated
thoroughly.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.759
Frankie, you took the truck
last week.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.664
Wasn't that enough?

20:02.701 --> 20:03.793
Stop walking around.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.168
Frankie, go do some homework.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.331
I've done my homework.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.340
Do some reading.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.602
Watch TV.
Do something.

20:09.641 --> 20:11.108
Grandpa, all I need
is the truck.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.371
I know you know
that I mean.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.379
Come on, Ma,
let me have the truck.

20:20.586 --> 20:21.553
I got a date!

20:21.587 --> 20:23.145
What do you take me for?

20:23.188 --> 20:26.316
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.656
He's cool; American style.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.992
His parents are
Chinese-style cool.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.656
Frankie likes going out,

20:32.698 --> 20:34.996
but they'd rather
he work in the store,

20:35.033 --> 20:38.298
selling milk and bread
and lizards.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.539
Ugh!

20:52.317 --> 20:55.753
I mean, do I try to interfere
with your bookkeeping?!

20:55.788 --> 20:57.016
My business is comedy!

20:57.055 --> 20:58.249
That's what I do!

20:58.290 --> 20:59.848
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!

20:59.892 --> 21:00.859
Yes, you are.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.554
They're the money guys.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.561
Okay, slippery,

21:03.595 --> 21:04.562
bath time's over.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.824
Come out with your hands up.

21:05.864 --> 21:06.831
But I just got in.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.457
Oh, sure.
I believe that one.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.468
Let's see your fingers,
prune girl.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.299
Talk to the hand,
'cause the face

21:12.337 --> 21:13.429
ain't gonna listen.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.099
He asked me to come up

21:15.140 --> 21:16.903
with something new,
something fresh.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.170
You read it.
It was good.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.734
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script

21:19.778 --> 21:20.767
we've had all year!

21:20.813 --> 21:22.542
Yes, it was. So what
was their problem?

21:22.581 --> 21:24.071
Hey, I want to hear.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.380
Oh, yeah?
I want to sing opera,

21:26.418 --> 21:28.249
but I can't, so I don't.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.447
That downstairs is...

21:29.488 --> 21:34.323
Well, your dad
has a high-pressure job.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.656
What's a high-pressure job?

21:35.694 --> 21:37.628
It's when you don't
get to do what you want

21:37.663 --> 21:38.687
and when you do,

21:38.730 --> 21:39.992
you don't have time to do it.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.865
Do spies have
high-pressure jobs?

21:42.901 --> 21:44.664
Only when
they're caught.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.000
I'm never caught.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.198
You're right.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.399
You never are.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.067
Oh, look, a ugly water bug!

21:51.710 --> 21:52.768
Hey!

21:52.811 --> 21:53.835
Caught ya.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.175
Here she is.

22:00.619 --> 22:01.586
Night.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.587
Good night.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.612
Good night. You want
me to tuck you in?

22:04.656 --> 22:05.782
Golly can do it.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.595
"'The time has come,'
the Walrus said.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.120
"To talk of many things."

22:13.165 --> 22:14.655
"Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax."

22:14.700 --> 22:15.724
"Of cabbages and kings."

22:15.767 --> 22:17.098
"And why the sea
is boiling hot."

22:17.135 --> 22:18.432
"And whether
pigs have wings."'

22:18.470 --> 22:19.437
- Do you have any wings?
- Yeah.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.460
Let me see.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.244
Crap? No, no.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.808
This stuff is beyond crap.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.650
This is what crap wants
to be when it grows up.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.814
Listen to this.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.086
"A Question Corner
by Marion Hawthorne.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.525
"Horse riding,
for those who can afford it

22:42.561 --> 22:44.153
"is a very wonderful sport.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.994
"Every weekend,
my father takes me riding

22:47.065 --> 22:49.932
and we laugh together
as we ride."

22:51.470 --> 22:53.631
Does she mention
her mom pays for dork lessons?

22:53.672 --> 22:54.639
Man, once that

22:54.673 --> 22:57.608
disintegration ray
is complete... bzzt!

22:57.643 --> 22:59.338
She's molecular toast.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.606
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.375
Mom and Dad's night out.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.281
Me and Golly's night in.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.511
Hello.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.147
What's that smell?

23:10.188 --> 23:11.951
Delicious
German bratwurst.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.958
We hate bratwurst.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.619
I love bratwurst.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.787
Since when?

23:17.996 --> 23:19.156
I'll get it!

23:19.197 --> 23:20.789
No. No, no. I will get it.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.356
I'll get it! I'll get it!
I'll get it!

23:22.401 --> 23:24.369
I'll get it!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

23:24.403 --> 23:25.597
I said I'll get it

23:25.637 --> 23:26.968
and I mean
I'll get it.

23:27.005 --> 23:28.529
- I got it!
- No.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.974
I'll get it!

23:31.009 --> 23:32.636
Good evening, Katherine.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.305
The veggie thief.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.643
Katherine?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.148
Harriet Ann Welsch,

23:37.182 --> 23:38.979
Mr. George Waldenstein.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.712
How do you do?

23:40.752 --> 23:43.312
Yeah.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.516
I've seen him around.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.354
Bet he stole that pineapple.

24:21.526 --> 24:22.493
Good soup.

24:22.527 --> 24:23.687
Harriet,

24:23.729 --> 24:25.060
where are your manners?

24:25.097 --> 24:26.064
I don't know.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.123
Maybe somebody stole them.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.096
Hey, you cheated.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.464
Oh, you win.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.700
My congratulations.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.674
Yeah, well, I know some stuff.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.108
So, you're

25:12.144 --> 25:13.111
a delivery boy?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.578
Mm-hmm.

25:14.613 --> 25:17.946
Well, no offense, but, uh,
you're like, what, 45?

25:17.983 --> 25:19.280
Ish.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.945
Shouldn't you be
a delivery man by now?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.510
Harriet!

25:23.555 --> 25:25.614
Well, Harriet, I'll tell you.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.955
Not long ago,
I had another life.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.086
I had a big business,
I had a lot of money,

25:30.128 --> 25:31.095
and you know what?

25:31.129 --> 25:34.496
I was the most
miserable man alive.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.467
So, one day,
I told my wife that...

25:36.501 --> 25:38.162
- Wife?
- I told my wife that I

25:38.203 --> 25:40.398
wanted to start all over
again and if she wanted to,

25:40.439 --> 25:41.838
she could start all over
with me.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.465
So what happened?

25:43.508 --> 25:46.306
Oh, she left me, but that's
all right, that was her choice.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.812
My choice was to become
a delivery boy... well, man.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.576
I don't have the
business, of course.

25:50.615 --> 25:51.741
I don't have the money.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.751
You know what?

25:53.785 --> 25:56.151
My life is sweet again.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.758
Hmm.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.423
The wurst!

26:04.463 --> 26:06.590
Oh, no! My wurst!

26:06.631 --> 26:07.757
No, no!

26:07.799 --> 26:10.063
Oh...

26:10.102 --> 26:12.070
Oh, Lord.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.366
Oh, no. No.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.497
Don't be sad, Katherine.

26:14.539 --> 26:15.938
This is a blessing
in disguise.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.770
That's a pretty
good disguise.

26:17.809 --> 26:18.833
Don't you see?

26:18.877 --> 26:20.469
The three of us
have to go out for dinner.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.479
- No.
- Yeah!

26:21.513 --> 26:23.947
Yes, dinner and a movie!

26:23.982 --> 26:25.882
Movie, movie, movie!
Come on, Golly!

26:25.917 --> 26:27.475
The idea seems
popular enough.

26:27.519 --> 26:28.713
Yes, but the Welschs...

26:28.754 --> 26:29.721
Will be out.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.950
Till million o'clock!

26:31.990 --> 26:34.652
- Oh, please, Golly.
- Please, oh, please?

26:34.693 --> 26:37.355
Oh, please, please,
please, oh, please.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.295
Oh, please, please, please.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.593
What the heck.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.168
This is absurd.

27:42.027 --> 27:42.823
Yes!

27:43.895 --> 27:45.726
Don't speak.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.662
Wait! Wait for me!
I'm not dead.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.638
Are you okay?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.909
Yeah.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.142
Hey.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.173
How come
all the lights are on?

28:06.218 --> 28:08.049
Where is my child?

28:08.086 --> 28:09.883
Uh-oh.

28:09.921 --> 28:11.445
Harriet? Harriet,
what are you doing

28:11.490 --> 28:12.457
in that contraption?

28:12.491 --> 28:13.924
Come in here at once.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.050
Miss Golly,
what are you doing

28:15.093 --> 28:16.890
with my child, at this hour,
without my consent?

28:16.928 --> 28:18.156
- Who is that?
- My name is...

28:18.196 --> 28:19.163
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.664
We only went to dinner
and then a movie.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.633
Harriet is not
your daughter, Miss Golly.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.567
She is mine,
and you have no idea, none,

28:24.603 --> 28:26.127
what it is like
to come home and find

28:26.171 --> 28:27.934
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea

28:28.006 --> 28:29.064
that you'd be home this soon.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.734
I don't care.
I don't care what you did

28:30.776 --> 28:31.834
or where you went or why.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.742
All I know is this
can never happen again.

28:33.779 --> 28:37.237
Miss Golly... you are fired.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.249
What?! No!

28:38.283 --> 28:39.580
Just a moment.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.677
This is my fault. Please.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.950
Well, it seems
awfully sudden.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.149
Actually...

28:45.190 --> 28:48.489
maybe it's not.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.961
I think you're right,
Mrs. Welsch.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.861
It is time for me to go.

28:53.865 --> 28:54.832
What?

28:54.866 --> 28:55.890
What?

28:55.934 --> 28:57.333
What?

29:00.205 --> 29:02.332
Now, look, I admit, I lost it...

29:02.374 --> 29:04.103
because, I just...
I was frightened.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.576
But the thing is, the fact is
we need you, Golly.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.579
We can't do it alone.

29:08.613 --> 29:11.514
We all spoke out of turn,
I think.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.245
None of this is causing...

29:13.285 --> 29:15.082
Absolutely not.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.087
Absolutely, no.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.715
I mean, I think we were
talking about...

29:18.757 --> 29:20.156
our feelings out there.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.057
You were afraid
and-and-and now

29:22.094 --> 29:24.358
what we should
be focusing on, right?

29:24.396 --> 29:25.556
Is-is Harriet.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.087
Look, I'm sorry.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.463
- I lost my head out there.
- Look. There.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.865
- No, no.
- I was just...

29:29.901 --> 29:31.926
but you can't go...
I mean, we need you.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.868
Harriet would never
stand for it.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.236
Please, won't
you reconsider?

29:35.273 --> 29:36.740
You know, it's not about

29:36.775 --> 29:38.208
what happened
outside tonight.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.232
It really isn't.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.437
But Golly...

29:40.479 --> 29:42.947
I just... no, I think it's time.
I really do.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.608
Harriet can take care of herself
now, so she should.

29:45.650 --> 29:46.742
But Harriet's just...

29:46.785 --> 29:47.911
She's just a little girl.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.443
You know, it's the right thing.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.251
It's the right thing
for all of us...

29:51.289 --> 29:56.283
for me, for you
and for Harriet.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.297
Are you sure?

29:59.331 --> 30:01.891
Yeah, I am.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.144
"'The time has come,"
the Walrus said,"

30:14.179 --> 30:15.669
"To talk of many things...

30:15.714 --> 30:18.774
"Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax..."

30:23.688 --> 30:26.156
"Of cabbages and kings...

30:26.191 --> 30:29.592
"And why the sea
is boiling hot...

30:29.628 --> 30:32.995
And whether pigs have wings."

30:56.821 --> 30:58.982
Where you going to go?

30:59.024 --> 31:01.015
Well, I don't really know.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.151
I'm thinking I may travel.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.722
Are you going to go be
some other kid's nanny now?

31:06.765 --> 31:09.962
And love them more than you?

31:10.068 --> 31:11.228
Never.

31:11.269 --> 31:14.705
Remember, in my life,
in this world

31:14.739 --> 31:17.708
there will always
only be one Harriet.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.638
So get back to work...
you've lost nearly

31:22.681 --> 31:23.909
an entire day
on your notebook.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.712
It doesn't matter.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.911
It doesn't matter?

31:27.953 --> 31:29.648
Did I hear you say
"It doesn't matter"?

31:29.688 --> 31:31.155
Because I thought
I heard you say

31:31.189 --> 31:32.156
"It doesn't matter,"

31:32.190 --> 31:33.680
but Harriet wouldn't say that,
would she?

31:33.725 --> 31:34.692
Now come on...

31:34.726 --> 31:36.421
just because
you're on your own,

31:36.461 --> 31:38.691
doesn't mean the world
stops turning,

31:38.730 --> 31:40.994
or that there are
no more fascinating people

31:41.066 --> 31:43.193
to observe and fill
your notebooks with.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.135
That's your job, Harriet.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.001
That's your job for life.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.266
And when you're all grown up

31:49.307 --> 31:51.571
and you sell
your first novel,

31:51.610 --> 31:53.976
I'll be first in line
at that bookstore,

31:54.012 --> 31:55.775
getting my autographed copy.

31:55.814 --> 31:58.544
I hope.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.344
I'm not going to cry.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.921
I'm not going to cry.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.425
I'm not going
to cry.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.052
Ah, it's okay to cry.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.960
But whatever you do,
don't laugh.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.429
No, Harriet,

32:13.465 --> 32:16.696
I will not tolerate laughter
as I leave, no.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.758
Hey...

32:18.803 --> 32:20.293
come here.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.773
You remember...

32:25.810 --> 32:28.278
a good spy can
get in there and fight.

32:52.237 --> 32:55.172
Good-bye, Harriet the Spy.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.823
I was kind of worried, you know?

33:15.860 --> 33:17.953
I kind of thought, "Well,
there's something wrong

33:17.995 --> 33:19.360
with me or something," and so...

33:21.799 --> 33:25.166
Growing up from girl to woman,

33:25.202 --> 33:27.796
there's so much to get used to.

33:27.838 --> 33:32.070
This is the time when a whole
new set of feelings unfold.

33:32.109 --> 33:36.637
Feelings about yourself
and your maturing body...

33:36.680 --> 33:40.980
Everything's the same
as when Golly was here.

33:41.085 --> 33:45.283
It looks the same...

33:45.322 --> 33:48.223
it smells the same...

33:48.259 --> 33:50.227
but there's this
tiny hole inside me

33:50.261 --> 33:51.819
that wasn't there before.

33:55.466 --> 33:58.458
It's like...

33:58.502 --> 34:00.697
like a splinter
in your finger...

34:04.008 --> 34:07.102
only this one's
right above my stomach.

34:19.456 --> 34:20.786
Harriet,

34:20.824 --> 34:22.416
are you okay?

34:22.458 --> 34:25.053
Uh-huh.

34:36.139 --> 34:39.438
Something's... different.

34:50.955 --> 34:52.752
No cats?

34:52.790 --> 34:56.521
How can Harrison Withers
not have a billion cats around?

35:14.812 --> 35:16.609
They finally nailed him.

35:27.625 --> 35:31.959
I will always remember
that face.

35:32.062 --> 35:38.092
That's the face you make
when you really lose something.

35:43.007 --> 35:47.239
Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.051
Speak English!

36:04.094 --> 36:06.927
Oh, okay, you want us
to speak English, huh?!

36:06.997 --> 36:08.862
Well, you are a jerk, huh?

36:08.899 --> 36:11.561
I tell you, "Don't
take the truck.

36:11.602 --> 36:12.762
You smash the truck."

36:12.803 --> 36:14.100
Well, you tell me now,

36:14.138 --> 36:15.628
Mr. Wise Guy,
was one date worth it?

36:15.673 --> 36:16.935
...we have people
here shopping!

36:17.041 --> 36:18.508
Yeah.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.871
Hey, all right, Grandpa.

36:24.915 --> 36:26.075
It's cool, right?

36:26.116 --> 36:27.845
It wasn't a big deal, huh?

36:27.885 --> 36:29.182
I knew you'd
understand, right?

36:32.589 --> 36:36.252
Sometimes I think
families everywhere

36:36.293 --> 36:38.420
are exactly the same.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.123
Everybody get back to work.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.428
Mom, Dad, please?
Grandpa!

36:42.466 --> 36:44.661
Just calm down.

36:48.305 --> 36:49.294
Too exciting.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.702
$6.75.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.822
You got it or not?

37:27.377 --> 37:29.277
Hey, Sport.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.780
How you doing?

37:30.814 --> 37:33.339
Hi.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.744
Um, I saw you drop this outside.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.450
Oh...

37:41.859 --> 37:43.690
Thanks.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.329
I got to go.

38:08.486 --> 38:12.752
Now it's time for our annual
sixth grade holiday pageant.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.623
So... pageant ideas...

38:15.659 --> 38:18.150
who would like
to make a suggestion?

38:18.195 --> 38:20.060
Simon.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.325
Pirates.

38:21.365 --> 38:24.459
Okay.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.072
Good dramatic potential,
if not exactly seasonal.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.733
Anyone else?

38:32.576 --> 38:34.441
How 'bout the Manhattan Project?

38:34.478 --> 38:36.207
I can be J. Robert Oppenheimer

38:36.247 --> 38:37.942
and with the right chemicals,

38:38.048 --> 38:40.039
I know I can do
a mushroom cloud.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.075
That's impressive, Janie.

38:42.119 --> 38:46.055
But I believe there's
a taste issue involved.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.079
Ballet.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.284
Pilgrims.

38:48.325 --> 38:49.622
Musical.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.457
Swan Lake.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.364
Jazz.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.389
Vlad the lmpaler.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.527
Yeah, that's cool!

38:59.570 --> 39:03.097
I think the most excellent idea
for a pageant

39:03.140 --> 39:05.631
would be
a giant holiday feast.

39:05.676 --> 39:10.079
Something healthy, low in fat,
and very delicious, of course.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.548
There could be parts
for everybody.

39:12.583 --> 39:16.679
Uh, grains, vegetables

39:16.720 --> 39:20.451
and best of all,
a shiny, silver centerpiece.

39:20.491 --> 39:22.425
That's a very good idea, Marion.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.825
You could play the barf bag.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.729
She made me an onion.

39:27.765 --> 39:28.857
Tell me about it.

39:28.899 --> 39:32.300
"You, my dear,
are a great big squash."

39:32.336 --> 39:34.099
I'd like to squash her.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.402
I've got something better.
Come here.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.370
Smell this.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.609
Ugh!

39:45.649 --> 39:46.946
What is that?

39:47.017 --> 39:48.177
You like it?

39:48.219 --> 39:49.948
Wait, I mean you hate it.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.784
It's like something crawled
up my nose and then died.

39:52.823 --> 39:53.790
Excellent.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.621
It's a sulfur-based
alkaloid.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.718
I want it to chemically
fuse with combustibles.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.457
And, in English,
that would mean...

40:00.497 --> 40:01.623
Stink bomb.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.257
Stink bomb.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.961
We tape it to the
school air ducts,

40:05.002 --> 40:06.094
attach it to a timer,

40:06.136 --> 40:08.627
and five minutes before
the school play starts...

40:10.107 --> 40:11.165
Empty auditorium.

40:12.343 --> 40:15.176
Hey...

40:15.212 --> 40:16.873
What are you girls doing?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.575
Nothing.
Nothing.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.244
Are you getting ready
for your big stage debut?

40:21.285 --> 40:22.411
Actually, Mrs. Gibbs,

40:22.453 --> 40:24.819
Janie and I were just talking
about the school play.

40:24.855 --> 40:25.981
Right, Janie?

40:26.023 --> 40:27.923
Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

40:29.526 --> 40:31.460
Good, good.

40:31.495 --> 40:33.258
That's good.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.925
Janie, what is this
supposed to be?

40:35.966 --> 40:36.990
No, Mom.

40:37.034 --> 40:37.625
Don't touch it.

40:41.138 --> 40:42.264
What?!

40:42.306 --> 40:43.534
Janie!

40:43.574 --> 40:45.667
It's an experiment with mold.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.836
Oh... Janie!

40:47.878 --> 40:51.245
That's where my Veronica's
Closet bra went to, huh?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.113
You know,
I'm sick to death

40:53.150 --> 40:55.015
of this mad scientist baloney.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.110
Look at this.
Look at this.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.211
Girl, we got to talk.

40:57.254 --> 40:58.949
I don't know what I'm
going to do with you,

40:58.989 --> 41:01.014
but we're going
to talk.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.219
Some of Janie's experiments
really creep me out.

41:03.260 --> 41:07.526
I wonder if she'll grow up
to be a billion-IQ genius,

41:07.564 --> 41:09.828
or a total nutcase.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.721
Sport, Sport...

42:23.307 --> 42:24.899
Chicken man.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.043
Do it again, do it again.

42:47.798 --> 42:50.289
Sport.

42:50.334 --> 42:52.825
Sport...

42:52.870 --> 42:54.861
Sport!

42:56.173 --> 42:58.038
Help me.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.906
Hey, Harriet.

43:03.947 --> 43:05.414
Hey.

43:05.449 --> 43:08.043
All right, come on.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.288
How does it look?

43:21.331 --> 43:23.822
Uh...
give me the mousse.

43:26.203 --> 43:27.966
No, no...

43:28.005 --> 43:31.736
Don't worry, it's just
one of Dad's nightmares.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.140
I mean day-mares.

43:33.177 --> 43:35.168
He says it happens
to all great writers

43:35.212 --> 43:36.941
before they get their big break.

43:36.980 --> 43:39.710
Hmm, a real writer.

43:45.055 --> 43:47.853
My dad calls guys like your dad
"a starving artist."

43:47.891 --> 43:49.552
Who's starving?

43:49.593 --> 43:53.461
I cook, I clean,
I do the dishes and the books.

43:53.497 --> 43:55.328
What do you mean,
do the books?

43:57.601 --> 44:00.297
These are the books.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.305
Every week I get a check.

44:02.339 --> 44:04.034
I write the amount
down in here,

44:04.074 --> 44:07.305
I pay the bills and then
whatever's left is food money.

44:07.344 --> 44:08.902
I hate money.

44:08.946 --> 44:12.109
You'd like it a lot more
if you didn't have any.

44:12.149 --> 44:15.016
I got to get to work.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.318
Hey, Sport?

44:26.363 --> 44:27.728
No! Don't.

44:27.764 --> 44:28.924
Yeah, yeah, come on.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.058
Strike a pose.

44:39.042 --> 44:42.739
Spy route: Brand-new stalk.

44:42.779 --> 44:45.270
Home of Agatha K. Plummer,

44:45.315 --> 44:49.479
a big private house
with big-type security.

44:49.519 --> 44:52.716
Until today.

45:18.481 --> 45:20.711
A spy must choose
ingenious tricks,

45:20.750 --> 45:23.742
must blend
into her surroundings.

45:23.786 --> 45:25.754
Hiya, Freckles.

45:25.788 --> 45:28.916
Must live with being called...
"Freckles."

45:39.669 --> 45:41.933
Here we go, in you go.

45:44.007 --> 45:45.975
Here he is.

45:46.042 --> 45:47.566
So, here's the little monster.

45:47.610 --> 45:50.443
Bye. Wave to the man.

45:53.816 --> 45:54.976
Are you happy?

45:55.018 --> 45:57.145
Good.

46:10.066 --> 46:12.364
Oh, score!

46:56.913 --> 46:58.972
Quiet. Quiet, puppy dog.

46:59.048 --> 47:00.606
Go away!

47:02.185 --> 47:03.345
Don't, don't, don't.
Go away.

47:04.454 --> 47:07.252
Pee-wee, don't make me
come in there.

47:07.290 --> 47:08.780
Away.

47:09.959 --> 47:11.950
Go away!

47:14.163 --> 47:17.132
Pee-wee... get away

47:17.166 --> 47:19.600
from that dumbwaiter.

47:19.635 --> 47:21.728
Shut up.

47:22.805 --> 47:25.831
Stupid fuzzball.

47:25.875 --> 47:29.777
I ought to shave you down
and teach you to hunt.

48:30.740 --> 48:32.367
Shut up!

48:35.778 --> 48:38.269
No, no.

48:38.314 --> 48:39.611
No, darling.

48:39.649 --> 48:42.641
If you want to talk about
something delicious...

48:43.820 --> 48:44.946
...I have

48:45.021 --> 48:46.488
something delicious.

48:46.522 --> 48:49.320
I have the secret of life.

48:49.358 --> 48:50.655
Yes, darling.

48:50.693 --> 48:51.887
You simply

48:51.928 --> 48:53.452
crawl into your bed,

48:53.496 --> 48:56.158
and you never, ever
leave it again.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.527
Never...

48:58.568 --> 49:01.537
Ah, sweet Liberace.

49:05.775 --> 49:07.174
What was that?

49:07.210 --> 49:08.734
I have no idea.

49:08.778 --> 49:10.905
Then why don't you

49:10.980 --> 49:14.279
go over there and get an idea?

49:16.953 --> 49:18.921
And if it's that rat...

49:18.988 --> 49:20.922
kill it!

49:20.990 --> 49:22.719
Oh, Mrs. Plummer,

49:22.758 --> 49:23.782
I'm sure

49:23.826 --> 49:25.817
it's absolutely nothing.

49:35.371 --> 49:37.396
Oh, well...

49:39.909 --> 49:41.934
A good spy never gets caught.

49:41.978 --> 49:43.946
A good spy
never gets caught.

49:43.980 --> 49:47.746
A good spy never gets caught.

49:47.783 --> 49:50.411
I am the suckiest spy on earth.

49:52.455 --> 49:54.719
Hey, Harriet, check this out.

49:54.757 --> 49:57.851
"This year's winter
pageant promises

49:57.894 --> 50:01.295
"to be truly inspiring,

50:15.611 --> 50:17.340
Oh, my God.

50:19.549 --> 50:22.109
I'd like to see her
split a turkey suit

50:22.151 --> 50:24.346
with butt-breath
Pinky Whitehead.

50:25.821 --> 50:26.981
Hurry up.

50:27.023 --> 50:28.285
You're so slow.

50:28.324 --> 50:29.848
Come on, you guys.

50:29.892 --> 50:31.757
Harriet, you want
to go play in the park?

50:31.794 --> 50:34.024
Or do you have to do that
top secret spy deal again?

50:36.032 --> 50:38.091
No. I can play.

50:38.134 --> 50:39.123
You can?

50:40.137 --> 50:41.536
Yeah, come on.

50:41.572 --> 50:42.698
No way.

50:42.739 --> 50:44.468
I still say we play
"Buy the Volvo."

50:44.508 --> 50:45.634
No way.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.007
- That's stupid.
- No.

50:47.077 --> 50:48.135
No way!

50:48.178 --> 50:49.372
You guys, I can be the dealer.

50:49.413 --> 50:50.880
You guys can be
the couples looking

50:50.914 --> 50:52.643
for a sassy yet affordable
family vehicle.

50:52.683 --> 50:53.741
Get real.

50:53.784 --> 50:55.342
Yeah, right.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.114
Okay, I've got it:
Hide and Seek.

50:57.154 --> 50:59.019
- No.
- Hide and Seek?

50:59.089 --> 50:59.817
I am set.

50:59.856 --> 51:01.187
That's retarded.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.157
Red Rover, Red Rover.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.181
No!

51:03.227 --> 51:04.455
That's a kid's game.

51:04.494 --> 51:05.927
I don't think so.

51:07.197 --> 51:08.596
- Kick the can.
- Kick...

51:10.067 --> 51:11.967
What about Spin the Bottle?

51:12.002 --> 51:13.128
Ew!

51:13.170 --> 51:14.330
Yeah, right.

51:15.606 --> 51:16.834
I got it.

51:16.873 --> 51:18.135
Bumper tag.

51:18.175 --> 51:19.836
See, now, that's a good idea.

51:19.876 --> 51:20.968
Eenie-meenie, miney-mo,

51:21.044 --> 51:22.341
Catch a tiger by the toe.

51:22.379 --> 51:23.744
If he hollers, let him go.

51:23.780 --> 51:26.510
My mom said to pick
the very best one,

51:26.550 --> 51:28.518
and you are

51:28.552 --> 51:29.712
it.

51:34.391 --> 51:35.858
Away, you foolish mortals!

51:38.028 --> 51:40.019
Beth's it!

52:18.969 --> 52:20.129
Got you!

52:22.005 --> 52:23.233
You run fast,

52:23.273 --> 52:25.833
but now I shall destroy you.

52:27.044 --> 52:28.033
Yeah.

53:00.911 --> 53:03.072
Oh.

53:08.485 --> 53:09.645
You winded?

53:09.686 --> 53:11.085
Nope.

53:11.121 --> 53:13.180
Me, too.

53:14.925 --> 53:17.018
Upsey-daisy.

53:21.331 --> 53:23.322
Time to move.

53:33.377 --> 53:35.277
Where's my notebook?

53:35.312 --> 53:36.540
Your what?

53:36.580 --> 53:38.639
My notebook!

53:42.652 --> 53:44.381
Oh, my God.

53:45.922 --> 53:46.889
Boy...

53:46.923 --> 53:48.220
- Wait, wait. No, wait.
- Carrie...

53:48.258 --> 53:49.589
Carrie.
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie.

53:49.626 --> 53:50.593
Andrews.

53:50.627 --> 53:51.594
Get this. Get... Okay.

53:51.628 --> 53:53.391
"Carrie Andrews thinks
she's so cool

53:53.430 --> 53:55.295
"'cause she spent
her summer vacation

53:55.332 --> 53:56.822
growing boobs."

54:00.070 --> 54:01.469
- Come on, read some more.
- Okay.

54:01.505 --> 54:02.870
Hold on, hold on.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.032
Okay.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.065
"Now, the Boy with
the Purple Socks

54:06.109 --> 54:07.406
is a man of mystery."

54:07.444 --> 54:09.207
Mystery!

54:09.246 --> 54:10.907
Hold on, you guys,
you guys.

54:10.947 --> 54:11.936
Listen, listen, listen.

54:12.048 --> 54:13.413
"The only thing more pathetic

54:13.450 --> 54:14.815
"than being Marion Hawthorne,

54:14.851 --> 54:17.285

Marion Hawthorne."

54:17.320 --> 54:18.651
Oh, Rachel.

54:18.688 --> 54:19.882
Rachel.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.288
She is...

54:21.324 --> 54:22.791
- Jealous.
- She's jealous.

54:22.826 --> 54:24.054
It's pure jealousy.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.425
You give that back now!

54:25.462 --> 54:27.327
Looks like there's something
in here for everyone.

54:27.364 --> 54:28.922
You heard her, Marion.

54:28.965 --> 54:32.423
Give it back before I pound you
into the cement.

54:32.469 --> 54:34.903
Ooh, I'm so scared.

54:34.938 --> 54:36.166
Hey, maybe there
is something

54:36.206 --> 54:37.366
in here for you.

54:43.713 --> 54:44.941
Janie...

54:44.981 --> 54:46.676
Janie, Janie, Janie...

54:46.716 --> 54:47.876
Come and get it.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.442
Read it. Come on.

54:49.486 --> 54:50.976
What does it say?

54:51.087 --> 54:53.317
- Come on.
- Janie, Janie.

54:53.356 --> 54:55.381
"Janie really
creeps me out."

54:55.425 --> 54:56.585
Ooh.

54:56.626 --> 54:59.720
"I wonder if she'll grow up
to be...

54:59.763 --> 55:02.129
a total nutcase..."?

55:02.165 --> 55:03.462
A nutcase!

55:04.634 --> 55:05.931
Oh.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.129
Hey.

55:07.170 --> 55:08.432
Her best friend.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.269
That's her best friend.

55:11.675 --> 55:12.869
Beth.

55:14.578 --> 55:17.445
"I wish
someone would kick Beth Ellen."

55:17.481 --> 55:18.607
Oh!

55:21.852 --> 55:23.820
Uh, Laura.

55:23.854 --> 55:29.087
"Laura Peters...
her face looks totally...

55:29.125 --> 55:30.251
pinched."

55:30.293 --> 55:32.625
Oh.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.492
"If I were the boy
with the purple socks...

55:40.504 --> 55:42.631
I'd hang myself."

55:44.341 --> 55:46.468
Something else.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.738
Cut it out, Marion.

55:47.777 --> 55:50.177
Oh.

55:50.213 --> 55:52.443
Maybe there is something
in here for Sport.

55:52.482 --> 55:54.177
No!

55:54.217 --> 55:55.309
"Sport..."

55:55.352 --> 55:56.284
Shut up!

55:56.319 --> 55:57.286
Fine, then.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.480
I'll read it right out loud

55:58.522 --> 55:59.511
so everybody can hear.

56:01.124 --> 56:01.783
No!

56:03.560 --> 56:05.755
"Sport is so poor,
he can't even afford food.

56:05.795 --> 56:07.922
"Why can't his father

56:08.031 --> 56:09.430
just get a real job?"

56:10.600 --> 56:12.625
Oh, and get this, as well.

56:12.669 --> 56:15.661
"One day, I had to pretend
he dropped a dollar

56:15.705 --> 56:18.674
just so he could afford
some milk and bread."

56:18.708 --> 56:21.199
Oh.

56:21.244 --> 56:23.303
Ooh, harsh.

56:23.346 --> 56:25.211
Oh, oh, oh.

56:26.316 --> 56:28.511
That's mean.

56:28.552 --> 56:31.180
Sport, I...

56:31.221 --> 56:32.347
I-I got to go.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.152
It-it's spaghetti night.

56:34.190 --> 56:35.953
I got to make spaghetti.

56:35.992 --> 56:37.983
I can't stay here anymore.

56:40.196 --> 56:42.460
Harriet...

56:42.499 --> 56:45.434
sit over there till we decide
what to do with you next.

56:46.703 --> 56:47.863
Wait. What's this?

56:47.904 --> 56:49.769
"I learn everything I can

56:49.806 --> 56:52.331
"and I write down everything
I see.

56:52.375 --> 56:55.208
"Golly says if I
want to be a writer,

56:55.245 --> 56:57.304
"then I'd better start now,

56:57.347 --> 56:58.541
"which is why

56:58.582 --> 56:59.913
I'm a spy."

57:05.488 --> 57:06.716
My position is bad.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.656
My position is terrible.

57:08.692 --> 57:10.660
My position could not be worse.

57:10.694 --> 57:13.356
Golly would know what to do.

57:16.766 --> 57:19.132
Harriet?

57:20.604 --> 57:23.334
Harriet, are you all right?

57:23.373 --> 57:25.204
Fine.

57:25.241 --> 57:26.572
Do you want anything?

57:26.610 --> 57:28.043
No.

57:28.078 --> 57:30.239
You sure?

57:46.529 --> 57:48.759
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly,

57:48.798 --> 57:50.857
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,

57:50.900 --> 57:54.802
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly.

57:54.838 --> 57:57.272
Harriet?

57:57.307 --> 57:58.638
I said

57:58.675 --> 57:59.801
I'm fine.

57:59.843 --> 58:01.936
Really.

58:21.998 --> 58:23.124
Lookit.

58:23.165 --> 58:24.359
Oh, my God.

58:31.541 --> 58:33.566
Hey, Sport.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.571
Janie.

58:41.551 --> 58:42.984
You hear something?

58:43.986 --> 58:45.977
No.

59:02.538 --> 59:03.903
Plug this in over there.

59:03.940 --> 59:05.066
Over there?

59:05.107 --> 59:07.075
Um, well, that one's closer.

59:07.109 --> 59:09.805
Carrie? Carrie?

59:13.549 --> 59:14.777
Oh, my...

59:21.057 --> 59:24.493
Sport? Sport, catch.

59:45.982 --> 59:48.416
Let me see.

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:04.956
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.265
We'll stay together

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.964
Until the end

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.064
We're moving up...

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:17.069
...and together,
we'll always have fun

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:21.106
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.414
We'll stay together

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:26.421
Until the end

01:00:26.455 --> 01:00:29.822
We're one for all,
and all for one

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:33.386
And together,
we'll always have fun...

01:00:43.205 --> 01:00:45.901
I will always have a notebook.

01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:47.932
Only Golly understands this.

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.775
I will write down everything,
and I'll know everything.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.576
And I'll take everything
I know,

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:53.980
and write my memoirs,

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.415
and be a huge, big, celebrity,

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:56.748
and go on all the talk shows

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.583
and tell them
Marion Hawthorne smells.

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:02.523
And... won't that rock?

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:13.129
What smells?

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.466
Eww!

01:01:14.503 --> 01:01:15.561
Did something die?

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:20.298
- Get away.
- Eww!

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:28.979
Where's your notebook, Harriet?

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.282
I don't know, Marion.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.414
Have you looked
up your butt?

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.190
You all better stop
being mean to me,

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.785
or else, I'm going to...

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.091
Or else, what?

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.995
Yeah, what are you
gonna do about it?

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.556
I'm gonna get you real bad.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.692
I'm gonna...

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:49.136
No, that's where you're
wrong, Harriet the Spy.

01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:51.469
We're gonna get you so bad...

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.906
and you know why?

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.671
'Cause we have a plan.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.699
Yeah!

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:40.147
I don't like giving orders
twice, you know.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:43.989
I told you to nail it
to the side, not to the right.

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:47.995
One, two, three, heave!

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.292
I need more nails.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:57.837
Harder, harder.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.984
Hold it, hold it.

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:14.481
A club for catching spies?

01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:17.219
I'm doomed.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:27.092
"If Golly said choose
between being a spy

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:29.127
"and having friends...

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:35.373
I'd pick spy."

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.742
Maybe you're not allowed
to have both."

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.084
Ugh!

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.989
Get her!

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.526
Spy-catchers are everywhere.

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.529
My route is ruined.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.895
No one can stand in my way.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.732
Forget that my heart sank

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:37.830
when I saw you standing there
with that policeman.

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:38.965
This is your mother talking.

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:41.065
But when I ask you
for some kind of explanation,

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.077
it's like...

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.078
It's not that big a deal.

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.079
Oh, no... wrong.

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.410
Being brought home by the cops

01:04:45.447 --> 01:04:46.573
is a very big deal, Harriet.

01:04:46.615 --> 01:04:48.242
Cop. Cop.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:51.481
One guy. That's it.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.545
No, that's not it;
we've spoken with Miss Elson.

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:54.681
You remember school?

01:04:54.723 --> 01:04:56.554
And she tells us
that you've done

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.923
zero schoolwork in days.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.087
All you do is play
with your notebook.

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:02.063
It's not play, it's work.

01:05:02.097 --> 01:05:04.395
School is your
work, Harriet.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:08.426
Yeah, well, she can shut up,
'cause I'm learning tons.

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:09.437
Oh, yes?

01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:11.029
Well, not about history, huh?

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.097
Not about geography.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.108
Not even English.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.133
I swear, if it's
not in your notebook,

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:17.475
it's as if you don't
want to know about it.

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.947
So what?

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:23.374
Harriet...

01:05:29.391 --> 01:05:33.225
This... obsession
you've developed

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.924
is not entirely
healthy.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:39.492
Now, we've made
a decision.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:40.559
And-And we, uh...

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.695
We want you to stop

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:42.965
with the notebook.

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:50.104
S-Stop writing?

01:05:50.145 --> 01:05:54.309
Not forever,
just as an experiment.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.614
Harriet, the world is filled
with so many things

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.279
a person like yourself
could enjoy.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.878
Well, that's right.

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:02.857
And you're going to find that,
sometimes

01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:05.724
just experiencing
them can be enough.

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:09.925
That's how I experience things...
with my notebook.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.226
Harriet...

01:06:11.266 --> 01:06:14.133
No. Let's see you
experience things

01:06:14.169 --> 01:06:17.400
without your unhealthy
obsessions, huh?

01:06:17.439 --> 01:06:19.930
Every day you come home,
and pour yourself a big martini.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.532
How come you don't
give that up?

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.568
And how many days go by

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.341
without you going
to a stupid party?

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.248
Or buying some other piece
of crappy jewelry... like, two?

01:06:28.283 --> 01:06:29.944
Don't take that tone with us,
young lady.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.282
We're your parents.
We make the rules in this house.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.515
Now, hand over
the notebook.

01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:35.489
I threw it away.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.890
You're sitting on it.

01:06:37.926 --> 01:06:40.554
I'm not moving.

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:44.089
If you make me move you,

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.192
I will move you.

01:07:02.217 --> 01:07:04.583
I'll just get another one.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.609
Oh?

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:08.418
Miss Elson will be checking.

01:07:10.592 --> 01:07:12.059
Harriet?

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.263
Don't you want
to talk about this?

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:16.730
No.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:27.433
Harriet... did we forget?

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:30.877
Notebook check.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.923
Dweeb!

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.254
Hey...

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.211
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:26.551
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:32.899
Oops!

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:35.395
I'm sorry!

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.200
You did that
on purpose!

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:39.332
It was an accident,
I swear.

01:09:39.374 --> 01:09:41.365
- Here, let me help you.
- No!

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.939
Get away!

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.542
Get away!

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.850
That's it, work together,

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:55.356
and we'll have Harriet
cleaned up in no time.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:56.550
Don't worry, Harriet,

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.787
we'll all help you.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:09:59.816
No, stop it.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.352
I don't need your help.

01:10:01.396 --> 01:10:02.624
You all get away!

01:10:02.664 --> 01:10:03.790
No!

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:05.823
No!

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.541
Harriet!

01:10:13.575 --> 01:10:14.803
Wait!

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.970
Whoa...

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:19.446
Well, that wasn't
very dignified.

01:11:43.598 --> 01:11:47.159
"To be... or not to be...

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:49.534
"That is the question.

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.334
Wait.

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.204
Is that a question?

01:11:55.877 --> 01:12:02.146
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

01:12:02.183 --> 01:12:04.378
"The slings and arrows

01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:06.614
"Of outrageous fortune

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.486
"Or to take arms

01:12:08.523 --> 01:12:11.924
"Against a sea of terribles

01:12:14.262 --> 01:12:15.957
"And by optioning, end them?

01:12:15.997 --> 01:12:16.964
"To die...

01:12:16.998 --> 01:12:18.124
I want to die.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.963
"To sleep no more

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:22.299
"And by a sleep to say

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.328
"We end the heart-chat

01:12:24.372 --> 01:12:26.704
"And the thousand
nags of shock...

01:12:26.741 --> 01:12:28.902
"The flesh

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:31.878
"is here, too...

01:12:31.913 --> 01:12:34.381
"'Tis a consummation

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:39.854
"Development to be wished

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:46.623
To die... to sleep no more."

01:12:46.661 --> 01:12:50.324
There are many signs that Tom
is changing from a boy to a man.

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:52.196
Tom is getting a deeper voice

01:12:52.233 --> 01:12:54.997
and sometimes it gives him
a little trouble.

01:12:55.036 --> 01:12:56.333
Don't be insulting

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.998
my... friend.

01:12:58.039 --> 01:13:01.600
This is an actual photograph
of vocal chords taken through

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.543
a special instrument.

01:13:03.578 --> 01:13:05.944
The chords vibrate
when the person breathes out.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:09.775
The larynx is here
at the top of the windpipe

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:13.310
and is the housing
for the vocal cords.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.171
Bra on a pole!
Bra on a pole!

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:51.021
Oh, no.

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:10.268
Hello, Marion.

01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:12.939
Get away from me, Harriet.

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:17.611
Or what, you gonna
tell your father?

01:14:17.652 --> 01:14:20.416
I heard my parents talking.

01:14:21.656 --> 01:14:23.624
You don't have a father.

01:14:23.658 --> 01:14:27.287
All those stories about
horseback riding are garbage.

01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:29.455
You made them all up.

01:14:29.497 --> 01:14:32.625
Your father lives in Amsterdam.

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:36.296
He hasn't seen you
in three years.

01:14:36.337 --> 01:14:39.500
And you want to know why,
Marion?

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.979
'Cause he
doesn't love you.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.004
Move.

01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:53.673
Harriet?

01:15:54.849 --> 01:15:57.511
Harriet, come down here.

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:04.423
Harriet, what's happened to you?

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:07.917
We've gotten calls
from every parent at school.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:10.020
They're all either
furious or terrified.

01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:11.429
Marion Hawthorne
can't stop crying.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.593
Laura Peters has locked herself
in the bathroom

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.829
and won't come out.

01:16:14.869 --> 01:16:16.496
The only parents
we haven't heard from

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:17.629
are Pinky Whitehead's.

01:16:19.307 --> 01:16:20.899
I'm not answering that.

01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:22.500
I always hated school myself.

01:16:22.543 --> 01:16:23.805
No, now, see,
that's the problem.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:24.903
What? I know...

01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:26.573
Something is very wrong here,
Ben, and you need

01:16:26.614 --> 01:16:27.808
...to take this seriously.
- I am!

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.248
- No, come on.
- I'm just as serious as...

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.273
You know what you're doing.

01:16:30.318 --> 01:16:31.945
- You're coming in and teasing...
- No, I'm not.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:32.952
We have a really
bad situation.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:34.420
We don't know what
the situation is at all.

01:16:34.455 --> 01:16:36.252
You always come in and make
jokes and then I have to come in

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.280
Do we know
what the situation is?

01:16:37.325 --> 01:16:38.292
...and be the grumpy one.

01:16:38.326 --> 01:16:39.452
Maybe we should find out
what it is.

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:42.588
I'm fine, I'm fine...

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.655
I'm fine,
I'm fine...

01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:46.792
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine...

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:48.426
I'm fine!

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:50.732
No, sweetheart.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:53.832
I can't understand
how this is fine.

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:58.009
Harriet, uh, uh,
can you explain this?

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.933
Well, what do we do now?

01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:28.508
We can do anything you like.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.408
What am I supposed to do?

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:32.037
How about a game?

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.809
Do you play chess?

01:17:33.848 --> 01:17:36.612
Golly was going
to teach me, but...

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:37.777
Golly?

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.150
Who's he?

01:17:40.488 --> 01:17:42.615
Just somebody.

01:17:44.392 --> 01:17:47.953
You sit here and play
with this stuff all day?

01:17:48.029 --> 01:17:49.291
Don't you have toys at home?

01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:50.490
Yeah.

01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:51.930
But I'm 11.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:06.112
You stink.

01:18:06.147 --> 01:18:07.546
What are you doing?

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:08.913
Just taking notes.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.281
Are they the mean,

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:14.880
nasty kind...
or the regular kind?

01:18:14.922 --> 01:18:16.787
Why?

01:18:16.824 --> 01:18:18.416
Because...

01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:19.756
I'm just telling you,

01:18:19.794 --> 01:18:23.230
it's tough getting away
with the nasty kind these days.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:24.959
Thanks for the advice.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.935
Nobody ever takes

01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:30.163
your notebook away from you,
I bet.

01:18:31.072 --> 01:18:33.734
Tell you what.

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:36.243
How about I give
you a notebook.

01:18:36.277 --> 01:18:40.111
Would you like that?

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.582
Yeah. Sure.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.107
This guy's not bad.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:46.518
Definitely one of those people

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:49.216
Golly says deserves
a closer look.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.954
At least he knows the value
of a good notebook.

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.518
Harriet?

01:18:54.562 --> 01:18:55.927
Hmm?

01:18:55.963 --> 01:18:57.396
It's time to go.

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:01.300
Can I keep the notebook?

01:19:01.335 --> 01:19:03.769
I'll have to talk
to your parents about that.

01:19:11.112 --> 01:19:13.410
Well, what did he say?

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:15.177
What did he say?

01:19:15.216 --> 01:19:19.084
Well, he says that, uh,
you're fine.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.921
And, uh, you're a wonderful girl
and very smart

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:27.086
and you'll be
a terrific writer some day.

01:19:27.128 --> 01:19:29.619
I could've told you that.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:58.050
I didn't read it.

01:19:58.092 --> 01:19:59.957
Good.

01:19:59.994 --> 01:20:01.894
You know, Harriet,

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:06.832
uh, someday... when you grow up...
you might have children.

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:08.893
Doubt it.

01:20:08.936 --> 01:20:11.234
Well, not tomorrow,

01:20:11.272 --> 01:20:13.797
or soon, but some day.

01:20:13.841 --> 01:20:15.433
Maybe.

01:20:15.476 --> 01:20:17.410
And, if you do,

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:20.642
you're going to try really hard
to understand them.

01:20:20.681 --> 01:20:21.978
But I keep telling you...

01:20:22.049 --> 01:20:24.108
I know, you told me
about the notebook.

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.949
And even though
you're telling me,

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.579
and even though
I'm listening,

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:30.318
I still don't
understand it, Harriet.

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:33.657
Is that why you
took it away?

01:20:33.694 --> 01:20:36.026
We made a mistake.

01:20:39.033 --> 01:20:42.491
Don't do it
again, okay?

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.027
We try.

01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:50.002
Mom?

01:20:50.044 --> 01:20:51.170
Yeah?

01:20:51.212 --> 01:20:52.611
Will you tuck me in?

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:54.877
Sure.

01:20:58.219 --> 01:21:00.483
There we go.

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:10.194
Green.

01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:11.698
G-R-E-E-N.

01:21:11.732 --> 01:21:14.462
Aren't you going to work
on your notebook today?

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.594
Yeah. Pick a number.

01:21:16.637 --> 01:21:17.865
Seven.

01:21:17.905 --> 01:21:20.703
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

01:21:20.741 --> 01:21:22.265
All right.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.279
"Turn around."

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:26.905
That's not a fortune.

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:28.313
Turn around.

01:21:28.349 --> 01:21:30.214
Why?

01:21:30.251 --> 01:21:32.310
Turn around.

01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:34.685
Golly?

01:21:36.023 --> 01:21:37.581
Golly!

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.330
Why, Harriet the Spy,

01:21:50.371 --> 01:21:52.168
I believe you've grown
a full inch.

01:21:52.206 --> 01:21:54.504
Nuh-uh.

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.339
You certainly have grown.

01:21:56.377 --> 01:21:58.277
Oh, Golly!

01:21:59.313 --> 01:22:02.111
So what do I do now, Golly?

01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:05.175
"Beauty is truth,
truth beauty.

01:22:05.219 --> 01:22:06.948
"That is all
ye know on Earth

01:22:07.054 --> 01:22:08.282
and all ye need
to know."

01:22:08.322 --> 01:22:09.949
John Keats.

01:22:10.057 --> 01:22:11.922
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:13.517
It means you've
got trouble.

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.153
You wrote down the
truth in your notebook,

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.357
and your friends, who weren't
supposed to see it, did.

01:22:17.398 --> 01:22:19.298
Now there are only two
things for you to do,

01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:21.460
and you're not going to
like either one of them.

01:22:21.502 --> 01:22:23.834
Like what?

01:22:23.871 --> 01:22:28.069
Well, you have to apologize
and you have to lie.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.907
But you said never to lie.

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:33.311
I know, I did.

01:22:33.347 --> 01:22:36.145
Let me see how
I can explain this.

01:22:36.183 --> 01:22:40.882
Sometimes a little lie that
makes people feel better

01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:42.980
isn't really wrong.

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.492
You know, like,
you can thank someone

01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:48.188
for a meal they cooked you,
even if you hated it.

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.356
You could tell a sick friend
that they look better,

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:52.696
even if they don't.

01:22:52.733 --> 01:22:56.863
Sometimes a really small lie
can be a really big help.

01:22:56.904 --> 01:23:00.465
They tried to squash me
like a bug.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.635
It's too hard.

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.406
It's not worth it.

01:23:04.445 --> 01:23:07.175
Aw, never say
that, Harriet.

01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:08.613
You're worth it.

01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:10.640
You're an individual,
and you know something?

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.175
That makes people nervous.

01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:14.619
And it's going to keep making
people nervous your whole life.

01:23:14.655 --> 01:23:15.952
My whole life?

01:23:16.023 --> 01:23:17.115
Yep.

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.853
What do I do?

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:21.487
You stay true to Harriet
and you accept the cost.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:22.655
Now, come on.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.961
That's enough lessons
for today, okay?

01:23:25.032 --> 01:23:26.727
You're 11.

01:23:26.767 --> 01:23:29.634
I think it's time for you
to start writing something

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:31.604
other than notes.

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.163
Like what?

01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:34.868
You'll think of something.

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:38.310
Can't you come back
for just a little while?

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:41.941
Oh, no, I never go back.
Only forward.

01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:44.075
And you know what else?

01:23:44.118 --> 01:23:46.518
Good friends are one
of life's blessings.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.852
Don't give them up
without a fight.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:04.094
Replicate.
Replicate.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:06.936
Stupid spores.

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.533
Hi, Janie.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.171
Look what you made me do.

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.770
This stuff is going to eat

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.281
right through the floor.

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:19.253
Three months of incubation
down the porcelain pee hole.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:24.492
If you roll the rug over it,
it won't show so much.

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:27.393
Oh, so next time you
can ruin the rug?

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:28.521
No.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.087
Then why are you here?

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:32.497
I just want to say that...

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:35.560
What?

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.663
Forget it.

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:39.298
Fine.

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:40.933
Forget it.

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:53.984
I'm sorry, Janie, okay?

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:56.887
I'm sorry.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.156
Will you take a look at this.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.495
Huh? Huh?

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.830
What do you think of your
old man now, Sport?

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:09.803
10,000 smackaroos.

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:14.871
No more paying with change.

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:17.673
No more, no more spaghetti.

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.475
Going to feel like steak.

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.675
And you know those fancy
basketball sneakers

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.707
with the, with the
buckles and the Velcro

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:25.117
and the crap all over them?

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:27.383
Their yours, buddy boy,
all yours.

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:33.961
Hello?

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:35.086
Murray.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.961
Hey, hey,
I take it all back.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.794
All agents
aren't useless.

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:41.131
Oh, I'm kidding you,
I'm kidding you, man.

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:43.770
You know I was always
in your corner.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.067
Oh, yeah, I knew
you'd come through.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.164
Well, Sport and I
are gonna do

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.231
a little celebrating today...

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:50.802
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:53.177
Sold his book?

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.977
Got a real job.

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.108
Hey, Harriet, you
hear the good news?

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:58.346
You're a writer.

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.384
So how's it feel?

01:26:01.423 --> 01:26:03.721
Oh, big slice off heaven,

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.589
side order of fries.

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:07.219
Say, you hungry?

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:09.059
I feel like going
to the fanciest,

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:10.758
schmanciest
restaurant in town.

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.027
We'll abuse the waiter.

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:13.295
Who's with me? Harriet?

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.528
She can't come.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.161
What do you mean,
she can't come?

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:17.501
You haven't even asked her.

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.666
I said she can't come.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.138
You can't be my friend
if you're not my friend.

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:34.917
I'm sorry, Sport.

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:37.686
I'm sorry.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.094
No one will forgive me.

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:53.471
Things will never be the same.

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:12.386
I have nothing left to lose.

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:17.354
Someone told me
the only reason

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.730
you guys play with me is
because of my mom's cake.

01:27:19.768 --> 01:27:22.635
Well, it is very good cake.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.738
Yeah, but how come we get
these pieces and you get those?

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:31.746
We told you,
we're officers.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.304
And we need our strength.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.248
You get to fix the clubhouse.

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.445
Somebody's dreaming.

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:41.250
I am so bored.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.189
If you don't like it,
you can leave.

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:45.283
Hey, you're right.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.590
Wait up.

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:52.691
Anybody sick of
listening to her

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.565
ought to get a life.

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:58.472
Okay, but you can't come back!

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.940
We're voting! It's official!

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.397
Shh! Teacher!
There she is.

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:32.933
Good morning.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.339
Today, we are...

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.309
Yes, Harriet?

01:28:41.216 --> 01:28:44.447
Miss Elson,
I've been thinking a lot,

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.043
and you know how class president

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:50.353
automatically gets to be editor
of the sixth grade newspaper?

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:53.451
Yes.

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:58.830
Well, I think...

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:01.768
I think that it's
too much for one person

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:04.567
and that it's not fair
to everybody

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:07.871
because everybody
deserves a chance.

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.046
And...

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.408
And we should change it.

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.078
Objection!

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:19.780
This isn't a courtroom, Marion.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.519
I like that idea, Harriet.

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.288
Let's see what the class thinks.

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.919
Miss Elson, I think

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:30.294
I speak for everyone when I say

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:34.028
this is, this is a really,
really stupid idea.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.695
That is one opinion.

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:39.331
But let's take a vote.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:43.538
Marion is now editor
of the Guidepost.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:47.412
Would anyone like to nominate
another candidate?

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:59.392
Well, I guess if no one
has anything to say...

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.854
I have something to say.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:15.232
I think that Harriet's
a very good writer and...

01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:18.803
if we only listen
to one person's opinion

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:21.542
we may never
get anywhere new.

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:25.416
But Harriet might have
something very original

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:28.251
and I'd like to read
what she has to write.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:36.295
Is there a second?

01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:38.765
I second it.

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:46.297
I third it.

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.475
Okay, then.

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:55.346
Harriet Welsch is now
a candidate for editor.

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.511
Who votes for Harriet?

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:33.148
That... is that.

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:35.519
Yes.

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:00.714
I am on a mission
to be a great writer.

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.283
A good friend once told me

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:07.810
that all great writers
try to see everything.

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:10.790
Okay, here goes:

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.760
I knew this guy once.

01:32:13.795 --> 01:32:15.956
He used to be a bajillionaire.

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:18.056
Now he rides a bike.

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:20.727
Want to know the freaky part?

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.403
He says the bike's better.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.000
Please write in
if you think he's lying.

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:37.106
There's a difference
between looking at stuff

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.449
and really seeing it.

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:43.083
Look who's here.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.751
Give them some bread, huh?

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:46.623
Here you are.

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.993
To really see,

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.554
you've got to get a closer look.

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:53.657
Why, thank you.

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:54.668
So much.

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.930
A cabbage.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.734
Carrots in here for you.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.263
And a sausage.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.957
I've noticed that, sometimes,

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:19.926
stuff you think
is broken forever

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:23.397
is actually totally fixable.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:29.767
But some stuff is supposed
to fall apart.

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.862
Speaking of which,

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:33.703
certain high ranking officials
of a certain

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:36.301
secret club had better
de-dorkify themselves

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.971
in a hurry...

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:40.577
or else everybody's going back

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:42.981
to where they were
in the first place.

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.985
This reporter believes

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:48.283
that de-dorkification
is a difficult,

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:50.222
but not impossible, process.

01:33:50.258 --> 01:33:52.658
Mostly, you've got to want
to be cured.

01:33:56.130 --> 01:34:00.533
But I'm pretty sure
it's a two steps forward,

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:03.594
one step back kind of deal.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:07.096
In theater news, Miss Elson's
sixth grade holiday pageant

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:11.441
was the theatrical controversy
of the season.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.846
Some were happy to see it,

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:16.873
and who am I to argue?

01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:36.165
Others say... it stunk.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:42.402
This reporter has no comment.

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:44.343
And, hey, stupid school board,

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:47.074
give Miss Elson a raise,
would you?

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:50.879
She's not so bad,
as teachers go.

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:53.614
And she puts up with a lot.

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:57.347
There's evidence to suggest
that Janie Gibbs

01:34:57.391 --> 01:35:00.292
will grow up to be
the world's greatest scientist.

01:35:00.328 --> 01:35:03.661
So far, she has shown amazing
progress in the areas

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.792
of mold manipulation
and chemical combustibles.

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:09.860
We have also learned
that Sport's father

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.099
is rolling in dough
from his latest book,

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:14.607
which just goes to show,
if you stick to what you love...

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:18.271
and work like a dog...
you will succeed.

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:20.940
For those of you who don't know,
a retraction

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.516
is when a newspaper
takes something back.

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:27.146
This newspaper would like
to retract certain statements

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:28.348
in a certain notebook

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.789
which may have hurt
certain people's feelings.

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:31.951
They were lies.

01:35:31.993 --> 01:35:34.291
And those that weren't lies...

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.955
were mean.

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:39.160
Like, just because
a person's father is far away

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.498
does not mean
he doesn't love you.

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:43.127
Anyway, don't think about it.

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.905
The truth is important,

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:51.400
but so are your friends.

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:57.977
And if you can have them both,
then it's a good life.

01:35:58.019 --> 01:36:03.753
Until next issue, I remain
your faithful correspondent,

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:10.526
Harriet M. Welsch.

01:36:15.036 --> 01:36:16.867
Get up offa that thing

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.805
And dance till you feel better

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.932
Get up offa that thing

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:23.374
And dance till you...
sing it now

01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:25.436
Get up offa that thing

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.504
And dance till you feel better

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.778
Get up offa that thing

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.512
Just try to release
that pressure

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:32.951
Get up offa that thing

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:35.785
And shake till you feel better

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.313
Get up offa that thing

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:38.950
And shake... say it now

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:41.621
Get up offa that thing

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.129
And shake till you feel better

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.961
Get up offa that thing

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:47.524
Try to release that pressure

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.126
Get up off...

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:50.967
Huh

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.131
Good God

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.936
So good

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:56.710
Uhh

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.609
Everybody ready?

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.146
Follow me

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:05.744
Get up offa that thing

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:08.084
And shake till you feel better

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.555
Get up offa that thing

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.080
And shake till you...
say it now

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.559
Get up offa that thing

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:16.062
And shake till you feel better

01:37:16.097 --> 01:37:18.327
Get up offa that thing

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:20.095
Just try to release
that pressure

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:21.692
Get up offa that thing

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:23.897
And shake till you feel better

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:26.099
Get up offa that thing

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.540
And shake till you...
sing it now

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.908
Get up offa that thing

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.503
And shake till you feel better

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.707
Get up offa that thing

01:37:34.749 --> 01:37:36.307
Ooh... so good

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:43.950
Huh!

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:45.389
Whoo-hoo!

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.893
Get up offa that thing

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:55.902
Eew, a stink bomb!

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:58.336
Get up offa that thing

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.805
Get up offa that thing

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.902
Dance till you feel better

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:06.912
Get up offa that thing

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.572
Just try to release
that pressure

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:09.776
Wait a minute

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.213
Funky

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:18.919
I need it.

01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:44.448
A crack in the door

01:38:44.486 --> 01:38:47.751
A slit in the vines

01:38:47.789 --> 01:38:50.952
A hole in the fence

01:38:50.992 --> 01:38:52.960
So easy to find

01:38:52.994 --> 01:38:59.297
People doing people things

01:38:59.334 --> 01:39:05.898
Whatever that might be

01:39:05.941 --> 01:39:12.744
They go on
about their business

01:39:12.781 --> 01:39:19.084
Too wrapped up to see

01:39:19.121 --> 01:39:22.579
In the shadows

01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:28.426
My unblinking eye

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:33.958
I love...
the secretive life

01:39:38.473 --> 01:39:41.601
I hide in the park,
behind a bush

01:39:41.643 --> 01:39:43.611
I see runners and skaters

01:39:43.645 --> 01:39:48.275
And a half naked man
showing off his tattoos

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:51.774
And I see old Mr. Gray
in his bad toupee

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.948
With some dumb girl
about half his age

01:39:54.990 --> 01:40:01.293
- People doing people things
- Definitely not his wife

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:08.132
Are calling out to me

01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:14.302
All their grand
and foolish schemes

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:21.305
It's better than TV

01:40:21.349 --> 01:40:30.656
They're so funny,
I could almost cry

01:40:30.692 --> 01:40:36.995
I love...
the secretive life

01:40:37.032 --> 01:40:40.490
There's Johnny's dad
on his third martini

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:42.332
And his nose
is getting bigger

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:45.828
As I watch him through
the kitchen window

01:40:45.874 --> 01:40:50.504
They really oughta
close those blinds

01:40:50.545 --> 01:40:53.514
And under my coat,
I got a microrecorder

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:57.006
A pad, and a pencil,
and a picture of you

01:40:57.052 --> 01:41:00.351
I can't believe you did that

01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:03.289
I see two love birds
walking by

01:41:03.325 --> 01:41:06.624
With that sick and dreamy
