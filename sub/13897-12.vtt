WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.580
[WALTER] HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

00:03.630 --> 00:06.840
LOOK, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
JUST IT. I'M KIND OF BUSTED.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.010
THE GOOD NEWS IS I'D BE ABLE
TO PAY YOU BACK IN, LIKE,

00:09.800 --> 00:11.550
A FEW WEEKS OR DAYS.

00:11.590 --> 00:15.140
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE,
LIKE LOVE TO HELP YOU,

00:15.180 --> 00:17.560
BUT YOUR SISTER
BREAKING UP WITH ME?
THAT COST ME A LOT.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.720
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:18.770 --> 00:20.100
MY SISTER DIDN'T TAKE
ANY MONEY FROM YOU.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.060
NO, BUT I'VE BEEN OUT
DRUNK EVERY NIGHT.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.690
THAT'S NOT CHEAP, RIGHT?

00:24.730 --> 00:27.070
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE HEARTBROKEN

00:27.110 --> 00:28.440
AND ALL THAT,
BUT TO BE HONEST,

00:28.480 --> 00:31.110
YOU KIND OF DODGED A BULLET
WITH MY SISTER.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.110
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.240
CHEERS.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.490
WE ARE PATHETIC,
LONELY LOSERS, MY FRIEND.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.660
I NEED A GIRLFRIEND.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.290
WELL, YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE ME, BUDDY.

00:45.460 --> 00:46.710
GOOD NIGHT!

00:46.750 --> 00:49.170
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME, BRODIE.
WE'RE DONE!

00:49.210 --> 00:50.300
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:50.340 --> 00:51.510
YOU'RE NOT...
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

00:51.550 --> 00:52.800
UNTIL WE SETTLE THIS,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:52.840 --> 00:54.050
LET ME GO!

00:54.090 --> 00:55.760
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
LEAVE ME? HUH? HUH?

00:55.800 --> 00:56.970
LET GO OF ME!

00:59.260 --> 01:00.270
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

01:01.930 --> 01:03.180
HI.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.310
&lt;BRODIE YELLS&gt;

01:06.100 --> 01:07.190

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440

01:14.280 --> 01:15.530
JAKE DOYLE.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.700
MY HERO.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.240
ANNABELLE.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.370
YOU IDIOT!
THAT WOMAN CONNED ME,

01:25.420 --> 01:28.130
STOLE FROM ME,
AND YOU JUST LET HER GO.

I LEARNED EVERYTHING I KNOW
ABOUT THE JOB FROM YOU

02:05.370 --> 02:07.120
-AND HIM.
-HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND.

02:07.580 --> 02:09.130
LOOK A LITTLE OLDER.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.040
DISTINGUISHED IS THE WORD
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.050
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.970
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; I'VE CHANGED ONE BIT.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.220
I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY SHIRT.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.180
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

02:26.640 --> 02:28.100
WHERE ARE YOU
STATIONED THESE DAYS?

02:28.140 --> 02:29.190
[SONJA] ONTARIO.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.360
RIDING A DESK FOR THE FEDS.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.320
I MISS THE ACTION, BUT, YOU
KNOW, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PAY.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.240
DESK JOB?

02:36.280 --> 02:38.490
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
MUCH LIKE YOU.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.820
[SONJA] P.I. RACKET DOESN'T
SOUND MUCH LIKE YOU.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.280
PEOPLE CHANGE, I SUPPOSE.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.160
YEAH.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.830
SO, GUMSHOE, WHO DO
YOU THINK KILLED HIM?

02:48.580 --> 02:49.830
NO IDEA.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.210
HOW ABOUT WE FIND OUT,
JUST YOU AND ME?

02:52.250 --> 02:53.250
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

02:54.380 --> 02:55.590
FOR REECE.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.260
I ONLY WORK FOR
MONEY THESE DAYS.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.260
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

03:00.300 --> 03:01.640
NOT SURE I DO.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.600
HE CALLED ME THE NIGHT
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.430
HE WANTED TO MEET UP.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.310
HE CALLED ME TOO.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.690
HELL, THERE ARE EASIER
WAYS OF TALKING

03:09.730 --> 03:11.100
THIS KIND OF THING THROUGH.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.230
YEAH, YOU WERE
WORKING WITH HER.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.400
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU TWO

03:14.440 --> 03:15.360
HAD THIS ENTIRE THING PLANNED.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.410
I'M NOT WORKING WITH ANYONE.

03:20.450 --> 03:24.580
AND I HATE HAVING KNIVES
STUCK IN MY FACE.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.370
&lt;SOBS&gt;

03:27.200 --> 03:28.330
ARE YOU CRYING OVER THERE?

03:28.370 --> 03:30.420
NO. I'M CRYING.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.330
I REALLY LOVED ANNABELLE.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.170
SORRY THAT
SHE WAS CONNING YOU.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.300
SHE WAS MARRIED
TO THIS OLD DUDE.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.380
HE CROAKED AND SHE DIDN'T
GET ANYTHING, AND THEN

03:40.090 --> 03:41.300
WE STARTED SEEING EACH OTHER,

03:41.340 --> 03:44.550
AND THEN SHE
CLEANED OUT MY BANK ACCOUNTS

03:44.600 --> 03:47.270
AND STOLE MY GRANDFATHER'S
ANTIQUE PRICELESS VIOLIN.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.560
PRICELESS? I MEAN, IT'S FUNNY.
IF YOU WEREN'T

03:51.600 --> 03:52.900
ACTUALLY BROKE,

03:52.940 --> 03:54.900
I'M A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.
I GET HIRED TO

03:54.940 --> 03:57.530
FIND THESE KINDS OF
THINGS ALL THE TIME.

03:57.570 --> 04:01.450
WELL, IF YOU WERE TO GET
EVERYTHING BACK THAT SHE
STOLE FROM ME,

04:01.490 --> 04:04.450
I'D BE WILLING
TO GIVE YOU 10%.

04:04.490 --> 04:06.530
10% OF WHAT, EXACTLY?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.910
THAT VIOLIN.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.660
THAT VIOLIN
IS WORTH SIX FIGURES,

04:10.710 --> 04:12.620
AND SHE TOOK EASILY

04:12.670 --> 04:14.460
100 GRAND OF MY CASH.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.050
SO 10% OF...

04:20.420 --> 04:22.300
-YOU HAVE A DEAL.
-GOOD.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.590
YOU FIND ANNABELLE,

04:23.630 --> 04:25.430
YOU'LL FIND MY VIOLIN,

04:25.470 --> 04:26.800
AND YOU'LL FIND MY MONEY.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.680
I'M GIVING THIS BACK TO YOU.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.270
DO NOT STICK IT
IN MY FACE AGAIN.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.810
I WON'T.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.480
I'M SORRY.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.830
DID YOU EAT? I MADE SOME
HASH FROM SUNDAY DINNER.

04:49.450 --> 04:50.540
-I ATE.
-HMM.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.750
A CALL WOULD'VE BEEN NICE.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.460
SORRY. HAD A LATE MEETING.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.130
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.170
PERFUME AND WHISKEY, HUH?

05:00.210 --> 05:01.710
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO
TELL ME, MALACHY?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.760
MY OLD TRAINEE,
SONJA STERLING.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.640
OH. WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.390
SHE WANTS TO DIG INTO
WHAT HAPPENED TO REECE.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.390
HE WAS MURDERED, ROSE.

05:10.430 --> 05:11.720
I KNOW, HONEY. I DO.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.100
PART OF ME
DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW

05:14.140 --> 05:16.440
WHAT REECE GOT HIMSELF
TANGLED UP IN.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.110
KICKED OUT OF THE FORCE,
DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE,

05:19.150 --> 05:21.400
LIVED ALONE ON BRAZIL STREET
TAKING ANY JOB HE COULD

05:21.440 --> 05:23.440
JUST TO SCRAPE BY.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.530
THE MAN'S NAME
HAS BEEN DRAGGED

05:24.570 --> 05:25.780
THROUGH THE MUD ENOUGH.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.950
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LEAVE IT WITH THE POLICE.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.790
I'M GOING TO GO HEAT YOU UP
SOME OF THAT HASH.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.840
PRETTY BIRD
YOU GOT THERE, JAKE.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.010
SHE GOES BY THE NAME OF
ANNABELLE KENT.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER AROUND?

05:43.050 --> 05:45.170
I SEES LOTS OF THINGS.
SOME ARE REAL,

05:45.220 --> 05:47.140
SOME ME DOCTOR TELLS ME
I MAKES UP. &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

05:47.180 --> 05:48.390
FINE.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.390
OKAY.

05:53.430 --> 05:56.310
YES. EVERYBODY WAS
BUZZING ABOUT IT

05:56.350 --> 05:57.600
SINCE THE RICH OLD FELLA DIED,

05:57.650 --> 05:59.560
AND SHE NEVER GOT A DIME.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.570
SHE'S, UH, LIVING IN
SOME DIVE SOMEWHERE NOW.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.360
SOME DIVE SOMEWHERE?
YOU GOT AN ADDRESS?

06:07.530 --> 06:10.200
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.790
ALL RIGHT, FINN, LOOK.

06:15.830 --> 06:18.580
THIS IS THE LAST FIVE BUCKS
I GOT TO MY NAME.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.750
CAN'T FAULT A GUY FOR TRYING.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.500
-GIVE ME THE ADDRESS.
-ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON NOW,

06:21.540 --> 06:23.130
UH, I'LL WRITE IT
DOWN FOR YOU.

06:24.010 --> 06:26.260
THERE YOU GO,
SO YOU DON'T FORGET.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.130
SO THOUGHTFUL.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.690
MALACHY DOYLE.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.060
HOW YOU DOING?

06:41.690 --> 06:42.900
SAD DAY.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.440
HE WAS ONE OF A KIND.

06:48.490 --> 06:51.450
RIGHT. SAY WHAT
YOU WANT ABOUT REECE,

06:52.330 --> 06:53.530
HE HAD A WAY OF CUTTING
THROUGH RED TAPE

06:53.580 --> 06:54.660
AND GETTING RESULTS.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.080
SO, UH,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.210
WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE CASE?
ANY MOVEMENT?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.790
BENNETT'S GOT A SUSPECT.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.250
SOME OLD SNITCH REECE
WAS MEETING WITH THE NIGHT
HE WAS KILLED.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.670
WHAT SNITCH?

07:04.710 --> 07:06.710
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING GREEK.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.550
ACHILLES? EVER HEAR OF HIM?

07:08.590 --> 07:09.800
NOPE.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.180
ODD NAME THOUGH.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.690
SO WE'VE DONE THE PUFFIN
AND WHALE TOURS AND, UH,

07:19.730 --> 07:21.810
WE WALKED UP SIGNAL HILL,

07:21.850 --> 07:23.560
SO WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT, GEORGE?

07:24.520 --> 07:25.610
WELL, NOW, IF YOU REMEMBER,

07:25.650 --> 07:28.070
YOU STOLE
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF MONEY FROM ME.

07:28.110 --> 07:31.240
I FIGURED OUT A WAY FOR YOU
TO HELP ME GET
SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.320
UM...

07:33.370 --> 07:35.030
I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED...

07:35.080 --> 07:36.620

GET INTERESTED, ALL RIGHT?

07:36.660 --> 07:38.750

07:43.420 --> 07:44.540
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.210
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

07:46.670 --> 07:47.630
MOM.

07:47.670 --> 07:50.680

SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER

08:42.690 --> 08:44.020
WHEN YOUR MOM

08:48.400 --> 08:50.740
OKAY, WHY DOES THAT
STRANGE MAN HAVE A PICTURE
OF YOU IN HIS POCKET?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.780
I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE,

08:52.820 --> 08:53.860
AND IT'S WEIRDING ME OUT.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.700
WHAT? YOU THINK
HE'S YOUR DAD?

08:56.950 --> 08:58.530
I WAS JOKING.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.810
YOU FOUND OUT THAT
SHE WAS REALLY
A CON WOMAN,

10:04.850 --> 10:08.230
AND THAT SHE MARRIED SOME
OLD RICH GUY, AND YOU GOT
DRAGGED INTO ALL OF HER MESS.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.270
I KNOW.

10:10.820 --> 10:11.900
BE CAREFUL.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.690
SHE'S TROUBLE.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.650
PLEASE DON'T HIT ME.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.610
-YOU'RE RIGHT.
-I AM? I MEAN...

10:18.570 --> 10:20.070
-I AM?
-IT'S LIKE ANNABELLE,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.450
SHE HAS THIS KIND OF
WEIRD HOLD OVER ME.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.450
YEAH. TOTALLY. I MEAN,
IT HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME...

10:25.500 --> 10:28.540
SOON AS SHE STARES AT ME
WITH THOSE PIERCING BLUE EYES,

10:28.580 --> 10:31.340
I... I JUST KIND OF MELT,

10:31.380 --> 10:34.630
YOU KNOW? I FEEL LIKE
A COMPLETE AND UTTER
IDIOT AROUND HER.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.340
I JUST... I LET MY GUARD DOWN.

10:36.380 --> 10:37.680
I DON'T KNOW.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.220
JAKE, NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU
TREATING ME LIKE A HUMAN BEING

10:39.260 --> 10:40.300
IS REALLY FREAKING
ME OUT RIGHT NOW.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.390
YEAH, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST MOVE ON.

10:42.430 --> 10:44.890
-REALLY?
-WHAT DO YOU GOT ON THAT
PHONE THAT I GAVE YOU?

10:44.930 --> 10:46.270
UH, OH. UH, NOTHING.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.100
IT WAS... IT WAS A BURNER.
IT ONLY HAD ONE NUMBER IN IT,

10:48.140 --> 10:50.400
BUT I MATCHED IT TO
A HOLDEN NEELY.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.690
RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT FATHER?
HAVE YOU SEEN DAD
AROUND HERE ANYWHERE?

10:53.730 --> 10:57.780
UH, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK
HE'S DEALING WITH THE DEATH OF
HIS OLD PARTNER TOO WELL.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.070
HE'S ALWAYS HAD KIND OF
A SOFT SPOT FOR REECE.

11:00.110 --> 11:01.660
OH, ACTUALLY, UM...

11:01.700 --> 11:03.530
I SAW MALACHY
LOOKING THROUGH THIS.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.080
-I SHOULD GO.
-WHAT?

11:10.120 --> 11:12.000
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.840
HEY, LISTEN, IT WAS
REALLY NICE TALKING TO YOU.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.710
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE
GOING TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

11:15.750 --> 11:16.840
TOGETHER!

11:23.760 --> 11:24.890
HMM.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.140
GO AWAY.

11:31.310 --> 11:34.940
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.900
YOU ARE? I'M NOT QUITE
SURE HOW TO TAKE THIS.

11:37.940 --> 11:41.200
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL
BEEN RUNNING AROUND, TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHO KILLED REECE,

11:41.240 --> 11:43.870
-RIGHT?
-YES, I DO KNOW THAT,

11:43.910 --> 11:45.740
BUT WHY ARE YOU GLAD
TO SEE ME? I'M CONFUSED.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.540
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN
KEEPING SOMETHING FROM ME,

11:47.580 --> 11:50.540
AND TO BE HONEST, I'M A LITTLE
PERPLEXED AS TO WHY.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.880
I GET IT.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.790
YOU WANT ME TO SPY ON MY
OWN FATHER, DON'T YOU?

11:56.880 --> 12:01.010
SONJA STERLING.
SHE'S AN OLD RNC OFFICER
YOUR FATHER TRAINED

12:01.050 --> 12:02.890
BUT CAN'T RECOGNIZE.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.890
OKAY, I'LL ADMIT
THAT IS A LITTLE ODD.

12:04.930 --> 12:06.680
SHE'S IN TOWN NOW,

12:06.720 --> 12:09.770
AND I KNOW YOUR FATHER'S
BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HER.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.690
I NEED YOU TO
FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.900
LOOK, HONESTLY, LESLIE,

12:13.940 --> 12:16.570
FIRST OF ALL, MY FATHER
HAS KEPT ME OUT OF
THIS ENTIRE THING.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.900
LIKE HE'S SHUT ME OUT.
AND SECOND OF ALL,

12:17.940 --> 12:20.070
EVEN IF I DID KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON...

12:20.110 --> 12:21.400
YOU WOULDN'T
HELP ME ANYWAY?

12:23.450 --> 12:26.240
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.330
SO INSTEAD OF WASTING
ANY MORE OF MY TIME,

12:28.370 --> 12:30.080
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WALK AWAY?

12:30.120 --> 12:32.960
LESLIE, THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS
GOING TO SAY, FOR THE RECORD.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.630
-YOU SHOULD...
-YOU HEARD HER. WALK AWAY.

12:35.670 --> 12:37.750
I'M WALKING. AWAY.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
[KATHLEEN] BOXING?

12:40.970 --> 12:43.340
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS NOT YOUR BEST IDEA,

12:43.380 --> 12:45.180
GETTING A GUY
TO THROW A FIGHT?

12:45.220 --> 12:47.010
LET ME WORRY ABOUT
THE IDEAS, ALL RIGHT?

12:47.050 --> 12:48.850
YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT GETTING ME MY MONEY.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.850
HEY, MARCO. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.400
-YEAH.
-SIT DOWN.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.940
SO YOU FOLLOWED ME ALL
THE WAY OUT TO NEWFOUNDLAND

12:57.980 --> 12:59.610
FOR THE MONEY
I OWE YOU, HUH?

12:59.650 --> 13:01.940
NO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
I CAME HERE FOR

13:02.400 --> 13:04.200
FAMILY REASONS MOSTLY.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.950
BUT NOW THAT I SEE
THAT YOU'RE HERE...

13:06.990 --> 13:08.160
HE IS A CUTE ONE.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.870
I GOT A BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.910
UM, MORE LIKE, UM,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.540
A POSSIBLE LIFE CHANGER.
IN A GOOD WAY.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.920
TAKE A WALK.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.300
LOOK, MARCO.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.890
YOU KNOW WHAT
GEORGE IS CAPABLE OF,

13:27.930 --> 13:30.760
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.560
-HELP ME OUT?
-IT'S SIMPLE.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.810
YOU GOT A BIG FIGHT COMING UP

13:33.850 --> 13:34.890
THIS AFTERNOON, RIGHT?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.940
YEAH. WAIT A MINUTE.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.560
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME
TO THROW THE FIGHT?

13:39.730 --> 13:41.230
NO. NO, NO. I CAN'T DO THAT.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.610
WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOU CAN'T NOT DO IT.

13:44.650 --> 13:47.620
YOU OWE GEORGE
A LOT OF MONEY,
AND HE'LL GET IT FROM YOU

13:47.660 --> 13:48.820
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.880
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TOO MANY
SIMILARITIES FOR YOU GUYS
NOT TO BE RELATED.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.500
HE'S SUPER HANDSOME.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.960
DETACHED EARLOBES.
OH, CAN YOU ROLL
YOUR TONGUE,

14:03.010 --> 14:04.970
BECAUSE IF GEORGE
CAN ROLL HIS TONGUE,
HE'S PROBABLY YOUR DAD?

14:05.010 --> 14:07.340
SHUT UP. MY MOM'S HERE TOO.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.090
[DES] OH, MY GOD,
WITH MARCO THEROUX,

14:09.140 --> 14:10.600
"THE RED DEER DEVIL".
HOLY CRAP.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.100
WHAT? WHO IS THAT?

14:12.140 --> 14:14.810
HE'S A BOXER. OOH.
MAYBE HE'S LIKE YOUR
HALF-BROTHER OR SOMETHING.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.690
[TINNY] WHAT IS HE DOING
TALKING TO MY MOM?

14:17.730 --> 14:19.400
SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN HERE.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.400
MAYBE OUR BOXER FRIEND
CAN TELL US SOMETHING.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.980
[JAKE] HIS NAME
IS HOLDEN NEELY.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.400
HE WAS A NAME
ON ANNABELLE'S PHONE.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.070
I HAD MY WEIRD ASSISTANT
DES RUN A CHECK
ON HIS CREDIT CARD.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.740
APPARENTLY HE'S HERE RIGHT NOW
AT GOODLIFE FITNESS SOMEWHERE.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.280
ANNABELLE. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS TO ME,

14:32.330 --> 14:33.450
-ANNABELLE.
-[ANNABELLE] JUST...

14:33.490 --> 14:35.120
OKAY, YOU JUST
HANG BACK, OKAY? I'LL...

14:35.160 --> 14:36.040
LISTEN FOR A SECOND!

14:36.080 --> 14:37.580
-WHERE IS IT?
-WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.500
-HAND IT OVER.
-I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
DOING THIS. ANNABELLE.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
-&lt;CLANGS&gt;
-&lt;PEOPLE GASP&gt;

14:44.050 --> 14:46.420
YOU JUST KEEP SHOWING UP
AT THE MOST OPPORTUNE
TIMES, DON'T YOU?

14:46.470 --> 14:47.930
LOOK, WHAT ARE YOU
PLAYING AT, ANNABELLE?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.640
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
BRODIE'S STUPID VIOLIN BACK.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.930
IT'S NOT BRODIE'S VIOLIN.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.010
WHAT...

14:55.430 --> 14:56.430
[ALL] OH!

14:57.850 --> 14:59.600
-WHOA! WHOA!
-HAVE A GOOD WORKOUT, DICK!

14:59.650 --> 15:00.850
SOMEONE CALL THE COPS!

15:02.060 --> 15:03.770
&lt;WOMEN SCREAM&gt;

15:05.230 --> 15:06.690
[WOMAN 1] PERVERT!
[WOMAN 2] JERK!

15:06.740 --> 15:09.070
HEY! TAKE IT EASY!

15:09.110 --> 15:10.160
STOP KICKING ME!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.120
-OH.
-WHAT'RE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO ME?

15:16.160 --> 15:18.960
THERE'S MORE TO THIS VIOLIN
STORY THAN BRODIE TOLD YOU.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.580
I DON'T CARE.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.790
IT WAS NEVER BRODIE'S VIOLIN.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.960
HE'S A THIEF AND YOU JUST
HELPED HIM STEAL IT.

15:31.470 --> 15:34.390
&lt;GROANS&gt; JUST, JUST STOP.
ALL RIGHT?

15:34.430 --> 15:38.060
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT BRODIE IS CONNING ME,
BUT YOU'RE NOT?

15:38.100 --> 15:41.600
HE NEEDED YOU TO TRACK ME
TO HOLDEN TO GET THE VIOLIN.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.730
BRODIE IS A CON
AND A CROOK.

15:45.020 --> 15:46.280
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

15:46.320 --> 15:48.400
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM, BUT

15:48.440 --> 15:51.280
FOR SOME REASON
I CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD THAT
COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.030
JAKE, I'M WORKING A CASE,

15:53.070 --> 15:55.200
AS A FULLY LICENSED
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.370
JUST LIKE YOU.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.460
YOU'RE DOING WHAT NOW?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.840
HALLWAY. NOW.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.840
EXCUSE US.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.350
I GOT TO SAY,
I AM VERY, VERY CURIOUS

16:18.390 --> 16:22.640
AS TO WHY YOU DRAGGED ME
ALL THE WAY UP FROM GENERAL
HOLDING TO YOUR OFFICE.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.900
YOU'RE GETTING
REAL CHUMMY IN THERE
WITH ANNABELLE KENT.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.730
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
YOU'RE JEALOUS. I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.280
-SHE'S JEALOUS. SHE'S...
-I'M NOT JEALOUS,

16:33.320 --> 16:35.240
BUT SHE IS TROUBLE, AND I
DON'T MIND TELLING YOU THAT.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.660
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME,
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT

16:37.700 --> 16:41.080
I'M A BIG BOY
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO ANNABELLE KENT IS.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.330
SORT OF.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.040
I'M SORRY IF I WAS

16:47.210 --> 16:48.840
HARSH EARLIER.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.260
IT'S OKAY.
I MEAN, YOU WERE HARSH,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.590
BUT I KNOW THAT I CAN BE

16:52.630 --> 16:55.140
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH
AT TIMES, SO...

16:55.180 --> 16:57.260
HOLDEN ISN'T PRESSING
ANY CHARGES.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.180
EVEN THOUGH HOOD
PUSHED HIM TO.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.100
SO YOU AND ANNABELLE
CAN GO HOME.

17:02.140 --> 17:03.140
THANK YOU.

17:12.690 --> 17:13.860
SO WHAT NEXT?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.780
AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED
I NEEDED A FRESH START.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.290
AND, UH, BEING A CON ARTIST

17:20.330 --> 17:23.120
DIDN'T HAVE
THE KIND OF UPWARD
MOBILITY YOU'D LIKE, HUH?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.210
PLEASE.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.790
I'M SORRY, ANNABELLE,
BUT YOU BEING A P.I.,

17:27.840 --> 17:29.380
YOU'RE WORKING A CASE,
I'M JUST

17:29.420 --> 17:31.460
TRYING TO PIECE
THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER.

17:32.670 --> 17:33.800
HONESTLY?

17:36.010 --> 17:40.100
WHEN WE FIRST MET,
I FELT LIKE YOU GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE.

17:40.140 --> 17:41.890
I WANTED TO DO THAT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.140
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A GOOD START.

17:43.180 --> 17:45.980
RIGHT. SO

17:46.020 --> 17:48.110
YOU'RE HIRED TO
FIND THIS VIOLIN.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.480
WHAT'S THE STORY THERE?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.820
IT'S A VERY RARE INSTRUMENT.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.610
IT WAS STOLEN
FROM MY CLIENT
EARLIER THIS YEAR,

17:53.650 --> 17:56.160
AND HE WANTS IT BACK.
AND HE'S PAYING WELL.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.950
THIS CLIENT, HE HAVE A NAME?

17:57.990 --> 17:59.370
HE'D PREFER I KEEP THAT
TO MYSELF.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.330
OF COURSE HE WOULD.

18:01.370 --> 18:05.330
BUT, UH, HEY,
SEEING AS YOU KIND OF
VIOLIN-BLOCKED ME BACK THERE,

18:05.370 --> 18:06.670
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU HELP ME GET IT BACK,

18:06.710 --> 18:07.920
80-20 SPLIT?

18:08.330 --> 18:09.540
WHAT?

18:09.590 --> 18:12.340
ANNABELLE, YOU'RE AN
ADMITTED CON ARTIST.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.510
PLEASE. I'M AN EX-CON ARTIST.

18:14.550 --> 18:17.510
AND THIS CASE DOESN'T EXACTLY
HAVE THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY

18:17.550 --> 18:19.260
THAT I'M
COMFORTABLE WITH, SO...

18:19.300 --> 18:21.100
OKAY. LOOK,

18:21.140 --> 18:22.640
I'M NOT GOING TO
TWIST YOUR ARM.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.890
YOU CAN
BOW OUT NOW, JAKE,

18:23.930 --> 18:26.270
AND I AM NOT
GOING TO THINK
ANY LESS OF YOU,

18:26.310 --> 18:28.100
BUT THE MONEY IS GOOD.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.560
AND YOU AND I,

18:29.610 --> 18:31.270
I KNOW YOU FEEL IT.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.860
WE'VE GOT SOME
CHEMISTRY HERE.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.780
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.450
OH, AND BY THE WAY.
YOU DROPPED THIS

18:43.490 --> 18:45.500
IN THE ALLEYWAY.
REMEMBER, WHEN YOUR

18:45.540 --> 18:47.870
KNEE ACCIDENTALLY HIT ME
BETWEEN THE LEGS?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.210
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.750
I'M SURE EVERYTHING
WORKS DOWN THERE, RIGHT?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.600
UH, EXCUSE ME? UH...

19:02.640 --> 19:04.390
UH, COULD WE HAVE A WORD,
PLEASE AND THANK YOU?

19:04.430 --> 19:05.720
KIND OF PREPPING
FOR A FIGHT HERE.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.850
-I'LL DO THE ASKING.
-[DES] OF QUESTIONS,

19:07.890 --> 19:09.350
SHE MEANS. OF QUESTIONS.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.850
SO YOU'RE A COP?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.980
THE TERM IS OFFICER.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.650
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE
YOUNG TO BE AN OFFICER?

19:14.690 --> 19:17.240
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
WATCH THE LIP, OKAY?

19:17.280 --> 19:19.110
OFFICER DOYLE IS A...
IS, UH,

19:19.150 --> 19:21.320
A TOP ROOKIE, FIRST CLASS.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.370
AND BESIDES,
IF I WERE YOU,

19:22.410 --> 19:23.830
I'D BE WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT SHE'D DO TO YOU

19:23.870 --> 19:25.330
IF YOU DON'T TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

19:25.370 --> 19:27.410
ABOUT THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

19:27.450 --> 19:29.290
YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME HERE.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.540
-WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?
-GEORGE?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.290
I OWE HIM SOME MONEY
FROM OUT WEST.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.800
HE'S NOT THE NICEST GUY
IF YOU OWE HIM MONEY.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
WAIT, SO HE FOLLOWED
YOU ALL THE WAY HERE

19:37.880 --> 19:39.130
TO COLLECT ON A DEBT?

19:39.170 --> 19:42.390
NO. APPARENTLY, HE MOVED
HERE TO BE CLOSER TO FAMILY.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.260
WHAT A COINCIDENCE, HUH?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.720
OH!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.520
ARE YOU ARRESTING ME
FOR THROWING THE FIGHT?

19:49.560 --> 19:51.350
NICE PUNCH, BY THE WAY.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.650
WHAT FIGHT? I MEAN,

19:53.270 --> 19:54.560
DON'T THROW A FIGHT.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.320
YOU'RE NOT LIKE ANY COP
I'VE EVER MET BEFORE.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.820
GOOD. THAT JUST MEANS THAT
WE'RE GOOD AT OUR JOBS.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.450
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

20:01.490 --> 20:03.320
JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE
YOU SPOKE TO US.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.950
OKAY.

20:05.990 --> 20:09.410
THAT PUNCH WAS A
GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
YOU WERE SERIOUS. I LIKED IT.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.210
GEORGE MOVED HERE
TO BE CLOSER TO FAMILY?

20:13.460 --> 20:16.750
-BRODIE WILL NEED TO PAWN THAT
VIOLIN BEFORE HE LEAVES TOWN.
-&lt;PHONE RINGS&gt;

20:16.800 --> 20:18.050
THIS IS YOUR TOWN.

20:18.090 --> 20:19.260
WHERE WOULD A GUY GO
TO HOCK SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.340
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-UH, JUST, I'M...

20:21.380 --> 20:24.050
I AM REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.930
-DAD?
-I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A
CHAT. CAN YOU COME SEE ME?

20:26.970 --> 20:29.220
YEAH. I THINK IT IS TIME.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.560
PLUS, LESLIE AND THE COPS,

20:30.600 --> 20:32.310
THEY'RE KIND OF
LOOKING FOR YOU.

20:32.350 --> 20:33.980
I KNOW. JUST GET DOWN HERE.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.020
I'LL TEXT YOU THE ADDRESS.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.030
-IT'S IMPORTANT. PLEASE.
-FINE.

20:39.650 --> 20:42.950
WE NEED TO TAKE
A LITTLE DETOUR FIRST,

20:42.990 --> 20:44.740
-IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
-SURE.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.450
ACHILLES. THAT RING A BELL?

20:49.490 --> 20:52.460
NO. REECE NEVER TOLD ME
THE NAMES OF HIS INFORMANTS.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.460
HE WAS PROTECTIVE LIKE THAT.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.380
ACHILLES WAS
AN INVESTMENT BANKER

20:56.420 --> 20:57.420
WITH A SERIOUS COCAINE HOBBY.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.750
REECE AND I
BUILT HIM UP FOR YEARS

20:58.800 --> 21:01.920
AND WOULD USE HIM
ANY TIME A CASE INVOLVED
MONEY LAUNDERING.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.510
BUT HE WAS
A GOLD MINE, AS I REMEMBER.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.760
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

21:06.800 --> 21:09.470
WELL, I'M SURE
MOST OF THESE CASES
ARE BEFORE MY TIME.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.350
-YOU SOUND RELIEVED.
-[SONJA] WELL,

21:11.390 --> 21:13.560
LAST THING YOU AND I NEED
IS TO HAVE OUR NAMES
DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD

21:13.600 --> 21:16.400
BECAUSE OF REECE'S
OLD BAD CASES, RIGHT?

21:16.440 --> 21:18.770
NOW LET'S FIND THIS GUY.
DO YOU HAVE A LAST KNOWN
ADDRESS FOR HIM?

21:18.820 --> 21:21.110
I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM
LATER, SEE WHAT HE KNOWS.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.360
-GOOD. I'LL COME WITH YOU.
-NO.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.610
THIS MAN, HE HAS A FAMILY.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.490
IT'S BEEN YEARS
SINCE WE LAST TALKED TO HIM.

21:26.530 --> 21:29.080
HE DOESN'T NEED US RUINING
THINGS IF HE'S NOT INVOLVED.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.750
I CAN BE CALM.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.540
SONJA, I'M DOING THIS
ALONE, OKAY?

21:35.710 --> 21:37.830
OKAY. FINE.

21:40.420 --> 21:44.760
I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING WITH ME HERE. IT'S...

21:44.800 --> 21:46.760
IT'S JUST SOMETHING I GOT TO
DEAL WITH WITH MY DAD.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.390
I'M NOT REALLY... IT WON'T
BE LONG. OKAY? I PROMISE.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.730
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

21:55.770 --> 21:57.520
WHERE'S THE VIOLIN?

21:57.560 --> 21:59.520
I NEED IT BACK
OR I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.400
HOLDEN, WE DON'T HAVE IT.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.530
ANNABELLE. YOU'RE WITH HIM?

22:03.940 --> 22:05.070
SHUT UP.

22:06.490 --> 22:09.070
I JUST WANT WHAT'S MINE,
AND THEN I'M GONE.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.450
LOOK, JUST GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.450
GO ON!

22:14.500 --> 22:16.080
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
"YOU'RE WITH HIM,

22:16.120 --> 22:17.330
"YOU'RE WITH HIM,
YOU'RE WITH HIM?"

22:17.370 --> 22:18.830
HE'S JUST, HE'S JEALOUS.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.130
-HI.
-HI.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.380
COME ON.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.760
I'LL BE...

22:31.050 --> 22:32.310
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.930
ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND,
KEEPING SECRETS,

22:34.980 --> 22:36.810
YOU'RE HANGING OUT
IN MOTEL ROOMS!

22:36.850 --> 22:39.480
SINCE WHEN DID YOU AND ME,
YOU KNOW, START KEEPING
SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER?

22:39.520 --> 22:42.070
IS THAT A JOKE? YOU'RE
ALWAYS KEEPING THINGS FROM ME!

22:42.110 --> 22:44.570
YEAH, WELL, I'M SUPPOSED TO.
YOU KNOW? I'M YOUR SON,

22:44.610 --> 22:46.530
YOU'RE MY FATHER. IT DOESN'T
WORK THE OTHER WAY AROUND!

22:46.570 --> 22:48.160
YOU KNOW, I WAS THE ONE
WHO CALLED YOU HERE!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.990
I KNOW THAT, MEATHEAD. I...

22:50.700 --> 22:52.370
UH, OKAY.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.500
SONJA, THIS IS MY SON JAKE.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.210
JAKE, THIS IS SONJA.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.880
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.460
WE MET
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.340
-I WORKED FOR YOUR DAD.
-WELL, IT'S

23:04.380 --> 23:05.630
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

23:05.670 --> 23:06.880
CAN YOU GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES?

23:09.130 --> 23:10.640
ABSOLUTELY.

23:15.430 --> 23:18.100
LOOK, THERE'S NO CONSPIRACY.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.270
REECE WAS MY FRIEND,
MY PARTNER.

23:20.310 --> 23:21.860
I OWE REECE.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.070
-I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
-&lt;SMOKE DETECTOR BEEPING&gt;

23:25.030 --> 23:26.530
[JAKE] UH, DAD?

23:26.570 --> 23:28.400
&lt;ALARM BLARING&gt;

23:28.950 --> 23:30.530
&lt;COUGHING&gt;

23:34.620 --> 23:35.700
WE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE!

23:37.500 --> 23:38.500
COME ON.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.540
-THE DOOR IS JAMMED.
-FROM THE OUTSIDE?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.130
YES, B'Y. FROM THE OUTSIDE.

23:45.170 --> 23:46.670
IF IT WAS ON THE INSIDE
I'D MOVE IT.

23:52.050 --> 23:53.470
BARS ON THE WINDOWS?

23:53.510 --> 23:56.770
I TOLD YOU YOUR CHEAPNESS
WAS GOING TO GET US
KILLED ONE DAY!

23:56.810 --> 23:58.600
IT'S A VALUE MOTEL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:01.650 --> 24:03.480
DAD, IF WE DIE IN HERE

24:03.520 --> 24:04.730
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

24:04.770 --> 24:05.860
YOU'RE A CHEAP BASTARD.

24:05.900 --> 24:06.940
SHOVE IT!

24:10.780 --> 24:12.360
&lt;COUGHS&gt;

24:12.410 --> 24:14.620
SOMEONE DIDN'T WANT YOU
GETTING OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

24:14.660 --> 24:15.490
COME ON.

24:19.700 --> 24:20.500
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

24:21.580 --> 24:22.620
COME ON.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.590
OH!

24:29.300 --> 24:31.760
SO THE COPS SAY
THE FIRE WAS STARTED BY

24:31.800 --> 24:33.720
SOMETHING THROWN
THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.100
YOUR CON ARTIST GIRLFRIEND
TRYING TO KILL US?

24:36.140 --> 24:38.270
OKAY, DAD, LOOK.
SHE'S A LOT OF THINGS,

24:38.310 --> 24:40.600
BUT, UH, A MURDERER
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.390
IS THERE ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW, I CAN DO

24:42.440 --> 24:45.520
TO HELP YOU WITH THIS
WHOLE REECE THING, OR...

24:45.560 --> 24:47.730
YOU'RE TIED UP
FINDING YOUR VIOLIN.

24:47.770 --> 24:49.690
YOU KEEP DOING THAT.
WE COULD USE THE MONEY.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.490
IF I NEED ANYTHING,
I'LL CALL YOU.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.700
FINE.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.700
-I'LL, UH, SEE YOU LATER.
-HEY.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.540
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:59.580 --> 25:02.830
YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT TO
INVOLVE YOU WITH THIS.

25:02.870 --> 25:06.130
WELL, SWEETHEART, YOU COME
HOME ALMOST HAVING BEEN
KILLED IN A FIRE.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.300
ME NOT GETTING INVOLVED
IS NOT AN OPTION.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.760
SONJA. MEET MY WIFE, ROSE.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.010
-HI.
-HI.

25:16.930 --> 25:18.510
I'LL GO BOIL THE KETTLE.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.650
HEY, YOU OKAY? I WAS WORRIED.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.610
AND WHEN I SAW
THAT SMOKE I THOUGHT...

25:31.570 --> 25:32.860
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I'D LOST YOU.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.120
RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
THANK YOU, I SUPPOSE, FOR,

25:38.160 --> 25:39.530
YOU KNOW, SAVING MY LIFE.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.750
WE JUST NEED TO FIND THE
PERSON WHO TRIED TO TORCH ME.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.040
UH, YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.500
WHEN YOU WERE
HAVING YOUR LITTLE

25:46.540 --> 25:49.340
LOVER'S QUARREL WITH YOUR
COP GIRLFRIEND,

25:49.380 --> 25:51.550
I LOOKED UP
HOLDEN'S RECORD
ON HER COMPUTER.

25:52.670 --> 25:55.510
YOU ARE A CRAFTY,
CRAFTY GIRL.

25:55.550 --> 25:57.970
HOLDEN HAS A BUNCH
OF ARSON CONVICTIONS.

25:58.010 --> 26:00.970
HOLDEN TRIED
TO BURN ME ALIVE
OVER A FIDDLE?

26:01.010 --> 26:04.390
I MEAN, THIS VIOLIN IS
A REALLY BIG DEAL.
EVERYBODY WANTS IT.

26:04.430 --> 26:07.600
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT'S A BIG,
BIG DEAL VIOLIN. I GET IT.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.770
YOU STILL DON'T TRUST ME.

26:09.810 --> 26:11.780
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO DO TO CONVINCE YOU

26:11.820 --> 26:14.820
THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE
PURE AND HONORABLE.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.240
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

26:16.280 --> 26:18.070
YEAH. I KNOW.
YOU'RE AS PURE AS THE...

26:18.110 --> 26:19.780
THE DRIVEN SNOW. I GET IT.

26:24.790 --> 26:25.710
HERE.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.250
AN ADVANCE.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.130
I HAVE A BIT OF MONEY,

26:30.170 --> 26:32.840
AND I'LL GET IT BACK
WHEN WE FIND
BRODIE AND THE VIOLIN.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.510
HOW MUCH...
HOW MUCH MONEY IS THIS?

26:34.550 --> 26:36.720
FIVE GRAND.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.640
I'M GIVING THIS TO YOU
SO THAT YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS.

26:42.220 --> 26:44.180
CONSIDER IT AN INVESTMENT.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.640
BUYING MY TRUST.
WELL, THAT'S...

26:46.680 --> 26:48.940
THAT'S AN
INTERESTING STRATEGY.

26:48.980 --> 26:50.440
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
FIND YOUR FRIEND

26:50.480 --> 26:51.650
WHO CAN FENCE A VIOLIN?

26:53.150 --> 26:54.820
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE FINN.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.360
FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED
SOMETHING, MARCO,
BUT I THOUGHT WE HAD

26:59.410 --> 27:00.700
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME IN MIND.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.740
GEORGE, WE DID.
I MEAN, YOU DID.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.450
NO, NO, NO. WE DID.
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:05.500 --> 27:07.250
I JUST COULDN'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.250
YOU COULDN'T, HUH?
THAT'S INTERESTING,
MARCO.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.000
YOU COULDN'T JUST
FALL DOWN, HUH?

27:12.880 --> 27:13.920
&lt;GROANS&gt;

27:13.960 --> 27:15.260
SEE, NOW YOU DO IT, HUH?

27:15.920 --> 27:17.670
OH, NOW THERE YOU GO.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.680
I SHOULD HAVE REMINDED YOU
HOW TO DO THAT LONG AGO.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.050
-OH!
-THERE YOU GO AGAIN!

27:21.090 --> 27:22.850
THAT WAS EASY,
WASN'T IT, MARCO?

27:23.930 --> 27:25.770
YOU REALIZE YOU STILL
OWE ME FOR YOUR DEBT,

27:25.810 --> 27:26.930
AND NOW
YOU OWE ME MORE

27:26.980 --> 27:29.690
FOR THE MONEY
I JUST LOST
BETTING AGAINST YOU.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.730
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED!

27:31.770 --> 27:32.980
OKAY, OKAY!

27:34.020 --> 27:37.780
LOOK, THIS WEIRD LITTLE
GIRL COP CAME TO SEE ME.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.200
YOU HAD
A LITTLE GIRL COP?

27:39.240 --> 27:41.280
YEAH, AND THIS
WEIRDER SKINNY GUY

27:41.320 --> 27:43.320
CAME TO SEE ME ABOUT YOU.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.620
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING.

27:45.660 --> 27:46.830
LITTLE GIRL COP, HUH?

27:46.870 --> 27:48.580
DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO LOOK LIKE THIS,
DID SHE?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.750
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S HER.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.710
YOU'VE SEEN MY DILIGENCE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
ESCAPE ME OR MY MONEY,

27:56.750 --> 27:58.800
SO YOU AND I,
WE'RE GOING TO TALK.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.340
AND YOU LET ME
WORRY ABOUT THE COP.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.560
[SONJA] SO THAT'S WHEN I
JOINED THE FORCE, THE RNC,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.850
AND THE BRASS
PUT ME WITH MALACHY

28:11.480 --> 28:12.600
AND REECE.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.900
SHE WAS LIKE
A STUDENT TO ME.
A GOOD ONE, TOO.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.950
WE'VE GOT OUR LEAD.
LET'S FIND THIS INFORMANT.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.070
HE'S OUR ONLY WAY IN.

28:22.110 --> 28:24.120
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
WHY WOULD HE KILL REECE

28:24.160 --> 28:25.410
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

28:25.450 --> 28:26.790
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU
SET UP A MEET?

28:26.830 --> 28:29.580
PUBLIC PLACE. JUST TALK
TO HIM. TRY AND GET SOME INFO.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.870
FOR REECE.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.750
I WOULD,
BUT HE'S DISAPPEARED.

28:33.790 --> 28:34.830
GONE UNDERGROUND.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.090
WELL, LET'S FIND HIM.

28:36.630 --> 28:38.800
YEAH. FIND HIM.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.170
JAKE DOYLE.
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.130
-YEAH.
-FYI.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.390
YOU KNOWS THAT GIRL
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?

28:45.430 --> 28:48.060
SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU, LOOK.
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

28:48.100 --> 28:49.770
YEAH, I KNOW THAT, FINN.
THANKS A LOT.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.810
LISTEN, I'M LOOKING FOR
A GUY, ALL RIGHT?

28:51.850 --> 28:53.480
AND HE'S TRYING TO
HOCK A VIOLIN.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.310
HAVE YOU, UH, SEEN HIM
AROUND HERE TODAY?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.570
NOPE. AND I WOULD
HAVE YOU KNOW

28:57.610 --> 28:59.900
THAT I OPERATE
A LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE HERE.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.190
NO ONE HOCKS NOTHING.

29:02.860 --> 29:04.030
WELL, I, I...

29:04.860 --> 29:06.410
APOLOGIZE FOR THE...

29:09.910 --> 29:12.620
SORRY, FINN, FOR, YOU KNOW,
OFFENDING YOU WITH
THE HOCK THING,

29:12.660 --> 29:13.790
-BUT, UH...
-ALL RIGHT.

29:13.830 --> 29:15.170
WHAT CAN I SAY? BRODIE!

29:15.750 --> 29:16.750
&lt;YELLS&gt;

29:18.880 --> 29:20.550
WHERE'S THE VIOLIN?

29:20.590 --> 29:22.260
I DON'T HAVE IT, I SWEAR.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.430
I HID IT. AND I WILL TAKE
YOU TO IT, ANNABELLE.

29:25.470 --> 29:28.180
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE WITH HIM NOW?

29:28.220 --> 29:30.010
YOU SAID
THAT YOU LOVED ME.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.680
WE WERE GOOD TOGETHER,
AND NOW YOU, YOU...

29:32.730 --> 29:33.940
WE HAD SOMETHING GOOD.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.150
YEAH, WE DID. WE DID.
AND I DID LOVE YOU.

29:37.190 --> 29:38.270
ANNABELLE.

29:41.150 --> 29:42.490
[FINN] I PAID FOR THAT.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.030
YEAH, WE WERE GOOD, BABY.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.410
WE DID HAVE
SOMETHING GOOD.

29:49.030 --> 29:50.540
WHAT ARE YOU...

29:50.580 --> 29:52.500
CONSIDER YOURSELF REIMBURSED.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.660
SHE-DEVIL!

29:55.330 --> 29:57.380
OH, NO. NO MORE OF YOUR LIES.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.750
-HAND IT OVER.
-JUST...

30:01.210 --> 30:02.880
THAT IS MY VIOLIN!

30:09.470 --> 30:10.850
UNBELIEVABLE.

30:12.430 --> 30:13.600
[ACHILLES] MAL?

30:14.730 --> 30:15.850
ACHILLES.

30:15.890 --> 30:17.810
I'D PREFER IF YOU
DIDN'T CALL ME THAT.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.360
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.690
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO SAY,

30:22.730 --> 30:24.190
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.950
REECE WAS GOOD TO ME.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.200
I'M NOT POINTING
ANY FINGERS.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.780
YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM FOR YEARS.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.040
OUR BUSINESS WRAPPED UP
WHEN HE LEFT THE FORCE.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.960
BUT YOU WERE CLOSE ENOUGH
TO VISIT HIS WAKE.
I SAW YOU THERE.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.870
WHAT, A GUY CAN'T
PAY RESPECTS?

30:37.920 --> 30:40.250
IT JUST SEEMS FUNNY IF YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN SO LONG.

30:40.290 --> 30:41.840
THE GUY
COULD HAVE BUSTED ME.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.090
HE WAS ALL RIGHT.
HE WAS DECENT.

30:43.130 --> 30:45.720
SO I WANTED TO PAY RESPECTS.
BIG DEAL.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.260
SO IF I DIG,

30:47.300 --> 30:50.390
I WON'T FIND ANY CONTACT
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU
IN THE PAST LITTLE WHILE?

30:50.430 --> 30:52.100
AND WHY WOULD
I TALK TO REECE?

30:52.140 --> 30:55.100
THERE WAS NOTHING
FOR HIM AND ME
TO TALK ABOUT ANYMORE.

30:55.140 --> 30:57.350
HE WASN'T A COP,
AND I WASN'T A SNITCH, SO...

30:57.390 --> 30:58.850
HOPE THAT'S THE TRUTH.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.070
DON'T GO DISAPPEARING
ON ME NOW.

31:04.110 --> 31:05.240
I'LL FIND YOU IF I HAVE TO.

31:11.740 --> 31:12.910
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

31:12.950 --> 31:14.240
OH, SORRY.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.660
I'M JUST, UH,
KIND OF EXPECTING A CALL.

31:17.870 --> 31:19.580
YEAH? WHAT DO YOU GOT?

31:19.620 --> 31:21.420
[DES] JAKE, I CHECKED EVERY
DETECTIVE LICENSING AGENCY

31:21.460 --> 31:25.130
ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND THERE IS NO RECORD
OF ANNABELLE.

31:25.170 --> 31:28.340
REALLY.
WELL, QUELLE SURPRISE,

31:28.380 --> 31:29.970
UH, WHATEVER.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.050
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
YOU WANT TO

31:33.100 --> 31:35.310
GO CHASE DOWN HOLDEN, OR...

31:35.350 --> 31:38.850
YEAH. UH...
I MEAN, WE COULD,

31:38.890 --> 31:41.350
BUT WE COULD JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW, CALL IT A DAY.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.770
CALL IT A DAY? IT'S...

31:44.690 --> 31:46.480
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?

31:46.530 --> 31:48.610
WE SHOULD GO, UH,

31:48.650 --> 31:50.490
RENEW YOUR
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR LICENSE.

31:50.530 --> 31:53.070
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-WHY WOULD I...

31:54.450 --> 31:56.490
-WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT?
-WHY AM I SUCH AN IDIOT?

31:56.540 --> 31:59.250
ANSWER ME THAT. ANNABELLE,
WHY AM I SUCH AN IDIOT?

31:59.290 --> 32:01.870
BECAUSE I KNEW.
I KNEW YOU WERE
LYING TO ME.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.750
YOU'RE NOT A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR. I CHECKED.

32:04.790 --> 32:08.720
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NO TRUST IN THIS RELATIONSHIP,
IS THERE?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.090
YOU KNOW, I'M HONESTLY
NOT EVEN SURE
I COULD EVER MAKE THIS WORK.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.180
WELL, THEN MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE
NOTHING BUT LIE TO ME

32:14.220 --> 32:16.560
SINCE THE MOMENT
THAT WE MET!

32:16.600 --> 32:19.100
YOU KNOW, WORDS ARE
LIKE DAGGERS, JAKE.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.810
THEY HURT
WHEN YOU JUST TOSS
THEM AROUND AT PEOPLE.

32:22.850 --> 32:23.980
I SHOULD BE PISSED AT YOU.
I SHOULD...

32:24.020 --> 32:25.980
I SHOULD BE PISSED AT YOU.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.030
BUT FOR SOME REASON I'M NOT.

32:30.150 --> 32:31.450
LET'S JUST...

32:33.740 --> 32:35.990
LET'S JUST
START OVER, ALL RIGHT?

32:36.030 --> 32:39.000
AND FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

32:40.040 --> 32:42.170
I DON'T CARE.
I DESERVE THAT MUCH.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.330
TELL ME WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON HERE. PLEASE.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.710
OKAY.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.840
I'M AFTER THE VIOLIN BECAUSE
IT'S A HUGE PAYDAY.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.260
I HOOKED UP WITH HOLDEN
TO GET IT.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.180
HE BACKED OUT
AND RIPPED ME OFF.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.270
I MET BRODIE AND

33:00.140 --> 33:01.520
NOW I'M WITH YOU.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.230
HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?

33:03.270 --> 33:04.650
Three hundred thousand.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.900
THIS FIVE GRAND
THAT YOU GAVE ME?

33:07.940 --> 33:09.610
IT'S COUNTERFEIT.

33:09.650 --> 33:11.690
YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.320
WE ALL DO WHAT
WE NEED TO DO TO SURVIVE.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.870
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

33:17.410 --> 33:19.290
YOU...

33:19.330 --> 33:22.580
YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO
THE MINUTE YOU SAW ME.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.630
-YOU'RE TELLING ME.
-I AM WHO I AM.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.830
YOU KNOW THAT.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.050
I THINK YOU'VE
ALWAYS KNOWN THAT.

33:30.090 --> 33:32.010
-BUT FOR SOME REASON...
-YOU'RE DRAWN TO ME.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.430
I LIKE YOU TOO.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.770
[HOLDEN] UNBELIEVABLE.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.230
MAKING OUT WITH HIM.

33:47.270 --> 33:50.570
IN PUBLIC. NO CONCERN AS TO
WHO COULD WALK BY AND SEE YOU.

33:50.610 --> 33:52.280
MAN, YOU HAVE
THE WORST TIMING.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.650
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.450
YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:55.490 --> 33:57.160
I AM SO, SO SICK OF... AH!

33:59.780 --> 34:01.700
-I AIN'T ASKING.
-THAT IS TWICE TODAY

34:01.740 --> 34:04.160
I WAS HIT IN
THE EXACT SAME SPOT, YOU...

34:08.880 --> 34:11.000
[ROSE] HEY. DID YOU FIND HIM?

34:11.050 --> 34:12.760
HE'S SHIFTY.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.300
HE'S DEFINITELY
HOLDING SOMETHING BACK.

34:14.340 --> 34:16.300
I DON'T KNOW IF HE
KILLED REECE, BUT

34:16.340 --> 34:17.590
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.140
DOES SONJA KNOW
YOU MET HIM?

34:19.180 --> 34:21.430
I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT SHE'S NOT COMING
CLEAN EITHER.

34:21.470 --> 34:23.270
BETWEEN HER
AND THE INFORMANT,

34:23.310 --> 34:24.850
THERE'S STILL
A STORY TO BE TOLD.

34:24.890 --> 34:26.350
OKAY, WELL, YOU BE
CAREFUL, MALACHY.

34:26.390 --> 34:28.560
-REECE WAS NO ROOKIE,
AND SOMEBODY GOT TO HIM.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

34:28.600 --> 34:30.060
UNTIL YOU FIGURE THIS OUT,
YOU WATCH YOUR BACK.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.440
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.110
SONJA? WHAT'S NEXT?

34:36.150 --> 34:39.280
MAL, I GOT A WITNESS. A GUY
DOWNTOWN SAYS HE SAW REECE
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.870
I'M GOING
TO SEE HIM TONIGHT.

34:40.910 --> 34:42.120
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.620
[SONJA] PERFECT.
I'LL TEXT YOU THE DETAILS.

34:43.660 --> 34:44.830
WHO IS THIS GUY?

34:44.870 --> 34:47.210
UH, I'LL FILL YOU IN LATER.
I GOT TO GO RIGHT NOW.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.250
EITHER WAY,

34:51.290 --> 34:53.300
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING'S
GOING TO BREAK TONIGHT.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.300
[HOLDEN] SHE SUCKER
YOU IN TOO?

34:57.340 --> 35:00.260
SHE'S A REAL SHE-DEVIL,
THIS ONE.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.680
I WAS MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS
WHEN SHE MADE ME

35:01.720 --> 35:03.930
STEAL FROM MY BOSSES
AND, UH,

35:03.970 --> 35:05.430
TAKE THIS STUPID FIDDLE.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.690
-IT'S A VIOLIN.
-OH.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.690
YEAH, ABOUT THE VIOLIN,
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

35:10.730 --> 35:13.270
YOU HAVE IT,
SO WHY HAVE YOU KIDNAPPED US

35:13.320 --> 35:16.190
AND DRAGGED US TO THE PLACE
THAT YOU WORK OUT?

35:23.660 --> 35:25.660
OH, THAT'S MUCH
CLEARER NOW.

35:26.330 --> 35:27.250
I LOVED YOU.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.580
YOU JUST SMASHED

35:28.620 --> 35:32.290
A $300,000 VIOLIN TO PIECES.

35:32.340 --> 35:33.960
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS
ONLY WORTH A HUNDRED.

35:35.250 --> 35:36.920
&lt;CLATTERS&gt;

35:36.960 --> 35:38.670
I USED TO WORK
AT THE AUCTION HOUSE.

35:38.720 --> 35:42.010
I STOLE, I GOT FIRED,
NOW WHAT DO I HAVE?

35:42.050 --> 35:44.680
YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WERE
GETTING INTO.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.730
AND DON'T ACT LIKE YOU
DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
OUT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.560
YOU WERE GOING
TO RIP ME OFF.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.310
NO, BABY, I WASN'T.

35:51.350 --> 35:55.320
JAKE WAS. THIS WAS HIS PLAN
ALL ALONG. BLAME HIM.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.530
WHAT?

35:56.570 --> 35:57.650
&lt;GUN COCKING&gt;

35:57.690 --> 35:59.320
STOP WITH YOUR
SHE-DEVIL TALK.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.240
YEAH, THE SHE-DEVIL TALK.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.160
UH, WHOA,
I'M WITH YOU, MAN!

36:03.200 --> 36:04.740
WHERE'S THE REAL VIOLIN?

36:04.780 --> 36:07.830
HOLDEN, BABY,

36:07.870 --> 36:10.960
I TOLD YOU, I HAVE A PLAN
FOR ALL OF THIS.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.500
BABY,

36:12.540 --> 36:14.250
YOU DON'T NEED TO
POINT A GUN AT ME.

36:14.290 --> 36:16.500
I HAVE THE REAL VIOLIN.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.960
WE'LL GET RICH.

36:18.550 --> 36:19.840
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.010
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

36:31.730 --> 36:33.190
I LOVED YOU.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.190
I LOVE YOU TOO, BRODIE.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.280
NOW WE GET
THE REAL VIOLIN,

36:41.360 --> 36:42.910
AND WE CALL IT A DAY.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.490
TOGETHER.

36:44.530 --> 36:46.030
JUST THE TWO OF US.

36:47.450 --> 36:49.200
COME ON. THAT SOUND GOOD?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.870
I FELL
FOR YOUR CHARMS BEFORE.

36:50.910 --> 36:53.250
I JUST DON'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE I CAN TRUST YOU HERE.

36:53.290 --> 36:55.460
COME ON, BABY.
LET'S DO THIS.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.300
IT'S UP TO YOU.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.960
I CAN DO IT ALONE,

37:00.460 --> 37:01.840
OR WE DO IT TOGETHER.

37:02.340 --> 37:03.800
ME AND YOU.

37:05.550 --> 37:08.310
OKAY, BABY. YEAH, OKAY.
LET'S DO THIS.

37:08.350 --> 37:09.350
YEAH.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.820
UNBELIEVABLE.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.480
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THIS.

37:20.530 --> 37:21.400
-IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
EVER GOING TO KNOW.
-&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

37:21.440 --> 37:22.740
BUT WHAT IF HE
ISN'T MY DAD?

37:22.780 --> 37:23.820
WHAT IF HE IS?

37:25.360 --> 37:27.410
YOU HAD A NICE LITTLE CHAT
WITH MY BOXING FRIEND, I SEE?

37:27.450 --> 37:28.620
NO. NO.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.410
-I WANTED TO KNOW...
-YOU OWE ME 200 GRAND.

37:30.450 --> 37:31.950
I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE MY DAD.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.080
I AM GOING TO COLLECT IT...

37:34.120 --> 37:36.040
-WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT?
-WHAT DID YOU SAY?

37:36.080 --> 37:37.710
WHAT... &lt;STUTTERS&gt;
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY ABOUT...

37:37.750 --> 37:39.710
ABOUT YOUR DAD?

37:39.750 --> 37:42.420
UH... I'M NOT SO SURE.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.390
YOU GOT ME OUT OF BED, BOY.
WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.060
-WHERE IS IT?
-I DON'T GOT IT NO MORE.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.770
-I'M TELLING YA!
-FINN,

37:55.810 --> 37:57.060
THERE ARE
TWO PEOPLE OUT THERE

37:57.100 --> 37:59.060
THAT WHEN THEY FIND OUT
THAT YOU CONNED THEM

37:59.110 --> 38:02.690
THEY ARE GOING TO HURT YOU,
BAD. SO RIGHT NOW I'M THE ONLY
SHOT THAT YOU GOT.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.240
GIVE ME THE REAL VIOLIN.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.490
&lt;GROANS&gt;

38:09.580 --> 38:11.870
NOW DON'T GO TELLING
NO ONE ABOUT MY HIDING SPOT.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.960
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.540
ALL THIS FOOLISHNESS
OVER A FIDDLE.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.340
IT'S A VIOLIN.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.010
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D BE
LOOKING AT, LIKE,

38:24.050 --> 38:26.430
A FINDER'S FEE FOR THAT,
WOULD YA, JAKE?

38:27.130 --> 38:28.260
GO TO BED.

38:31.180 --> 38:33.270
YEAH, ANNABELLE.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.140
I THINK I GOT
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
