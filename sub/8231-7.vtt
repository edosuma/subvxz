- Sure, Adam.

00:22.467 --> 00:23.633
I'd love to.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.067
- It's a marble.
- Yeah.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.367
- Watch this.

- It's a--it's
a roof Goldberg.

00:40.567 --> 00:41.733
- 'Cause we're on the roof.

Nope. It went back up.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.300
- Cool teacher.
- Yeah, he was cool.

He also was an ex-spy
on the run from the government.

in museums or any of that.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.633

ask me."

that you probably should know.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.900

I brought you here...

to steal something?

the best Ders Day ever.

Very cool.

to frickin' "suck it."

go to Chili's.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.367
If you guys don't keep it down,

04:47.467 --> 04:48.733
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.200
- You're gonna
have to ask us to leave?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.267
What are you, the king
of this place?

04:51.367 --> 04:52.767
Doubt it.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.833
- I am the Assistant Director
of the museum,

04:54.933 --> 04:56.567
and the Director is on
his honeymoon,

04:56.667 --> 04:59.233
so, yes, for all
intents and purposes,

04:59.333 --> 05:01.133
I am the king.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.500
Now, if I catch you causing
trouble again, you're gone.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.767
Understand?
- Understood. Understood.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.067
- Okay.
- Right. Right.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.267
- Congratulations to your boss.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.967
I can't wait to see the helmets

05:10.067 --> 05:11.500
and the--but, anyway,
so, the plan...

05:11.600 --> 05:13.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Is that I'm gonna

05:13.233 --> 05:15.200
steal the helmet, and
you guys are gonna be lookouts.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.900
Cool? All right. All right.
- Okay.

uh, if you could just kind of

05:19.433 --> 05:20.800
make it quick, you know?

This place has some serious
"Night at the Museum"

05:22.833 --> 05:24.333

all around this place.

05:28.633 --> 05:30.367

05:30.467 --> 05:32.733
but here's my selfie stick,
and you guys can play with that.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.900
Use it to peer around corners
as lookouts.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.667
Right?
- Oh, okay.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.133
I was wondering
why you were using it.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.533
I was like, "Wow, Ders,

05:40.633 --> 05:42.067
"what are you,

it's a heist tool

only losers have.

Very cool.
- Yeah, that's sick.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.667
- Yeah, exactly.

So, um, eyes peeled.
Lookouts.

took us to the museum.

thinks we're gonna sit around

06:00.067 --> 06:01.533
and be lookouts
while he gets to heist.

06:01.633 --> 06:02.967
- Yeah.

heisters, dude.

some stuff!

06:06.067 --> 06:07.233
- All right.
- Let's heist!

06:07.333 --> 06:08.633
- Okay, what?
What are we stealing?

06:08.733 --> 06:10.133
- I have no idea.
We'll figure it out.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.167
Let's just go look.
- All right.

06:12.267 --> 06:15.633
[classical music]

06:15.733 --> 06:17.333
- So it's only $13.99?
Is that right?

06:17.433 --> 06:19.067
- That's right.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.200
- So it's a steal after all.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.967
- Wow, look at this.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.633
Museum's so desperate
to seem cool

06:25.733 --> 06:27.533
they made up, like,
a spooky curse.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.300
- Okay, dude,
curses are very real.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.500
As you know, I've been cursed...
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.767
- With like a very huge,
long wiener.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.433
- I know that's a lie.
I've seen your dick.

06:36.533 --> 06:37.667
It's very small.

06:37.767 --> 06:38.967
- Not hard.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.200
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.833
- Well, I just figured out
what we're about to heist.

06:43.933 --> 06:45.933
You want a shmoke a bowl?

06:46.067 --> 06:48.067
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, dude.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.500
Yes, I like where
your head's at.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.867
But--I don't know, man.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.500
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.300
- We just need to find
the weakness in the cage.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.533
- What?

06:55.633 --> 06:57.300
[bangs]
Whoa.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.833
[bangs]
What are you do--stop.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.500
- Oh, here's the lock.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.767
You just need to wiggle your
tiny little spaghetti fingers

07:02.867 --> 07:04.867
in there, and wiggle it free.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.067
- Okay, I don't have tiny
spaghetti fingers, all right?

07:07.133 --> 07:08.533
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.200
I don't got a tiny
spaghetti dick either.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.633
- You do.
Yeah, we just covered this.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.133
You have a very tiny penis.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.633
- I don't.
You've never seen it hard.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.233
- I've seen it dozens of times.
- Not hard.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.733
- I'll just take one of your
bobby pins.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.267
- I don't have bobby pins.
- Yes, you do.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.500
- You have a small dick,
and you carry bobby pins.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.167
That's who you are as a person.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.500
- No, it's a pipe cleaner.
- Okay, just use it.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.967
I actually have seen
your dick hard. Okay...

07:25.067 --> 07:26.433
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.667
- Keep a lookout.
- Oh, yeah.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.067
- Obviously.
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.267
- All right. Based on the movies
I've seen,

07:31.367 --> 07:34.133
you just snap it in,

07:34.233 --> 07:36.233
you look off in the distance,

07:36.333 --> 07:37.500
and you just wiggle it...

07:37.600 --> 07:38.900
[lock clicks]

07:39.067 --> 07:40.300
- I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.667
- Are you kidding me?
You got it? Dude.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.667
Dude, I didn't think you'd
be able to do it this way.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.833
- You know, I believe in myself,
and that's what it takes

07:46.933 --> 07:48.100
sometimes to be a champion.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.500
- I'm impressed.
Okay.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.067
- Uh...
- Okay, she's gone. She's gone.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.633
How do we--
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.233
That is a weight sensor.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.233
- Let me do my magic.
- I'm gonna step back,

07:57.333 --> 07:59.767
'cause you're probably gonna get
killed by lasers or something.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.833
[ominous music]

08:02.933 --> 08:10.933
*

08:12.633 --> 08:13.767
Huh.
- Okay.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.067
Guess it wasn't
a weight sensor.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.433
- Yeah, my bad.
- All right.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.900
- Sorry about that.
- All right.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.367
- Let's go shmoke a bowl.
- All right.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.933
Hey, dude, when did you
see my dick hard?

08:21.067 --> 08:22.400
- Like, two Christmases ago,
you said

08:22.500 --> 08:23.800
it was something
about the eggnog.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.467
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.533
- Hey, check it out.
Pretty cool, huh?

08:27.633 --> 08:29.067
- Are you kidding?

08:29.133 --> 08:31.233
It's a bunch of old crap
put on mannequins.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.967
- No, no, you've got to--

08:33.067 --> 08:35.067
you've got to use your
imagination, right?

08:35.133 --> 08:37.733
Imagine you and your friends
on a Viking longship,

08:37.833 --> 08:39.700
battling the high seas,
and then...

08:39.800 --> 08:41.600
[gasps]
you discover America!

08:41.700 --> 08:43.100
But in the 11th century.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.767
Eat that, Christopher Columbus,
right?

08:44.867 --> 08:47.967
- I'm only here 'cause my mom
dragged me here.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.233
I'd rather be anywhere else.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.067
- You don't like museums?
- No one likes museums!

08:53.167 --> 08:56.633
Mom, this giant Ken doll
is annoying me.

08:56.733 --> 08:57.900
- No, I'm not.

08:58.067 --> 09:00.667
You're a Barbie-face
poopy mouth.

09:00.767 --> 09:02.100
- Smoke 'em, big chief.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.500
[both laugh]

09:04.600 --> 09:06.800
[smoke alarm blares]

09:06.900 --> 09:08.300
What did you do?

09:08.400 --> 09:10.567
- That's not us, right?
- Dude.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.267
- Excuse me.
Excuse me, everyone.

09:12.367 --> 09:13.833
We need to evacuate
the building.

09:13.933 --> 09:17.067
Please move to the nearest exit.
No running! Jesus.

09:17.167 --> 09:20.367
- Okay. Hey, just follow me.
- Yeah, okay.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.167
- You two, let's go.

09:22.267 --> 09:24.167
- Yeah, no, that's
what we're doing. [inaudible].

09:24.267 --> 09:28.067
- We're having so much fun.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.233
[mumbling indistinctly]

09:29.333 --> 09:30.500
You think anybody saw us?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.067
- Hey, you guys.
- Oh!

09:32.100 --> 09:33.667
- What's happening?
Guess what? Success!

09:33.767 --> 09:35.733
- Oh! Yeah, it was.
- Cool!

09:35.833 --> 09:37.767
- All right, man, I guess it was
a double success,

09:37.867 --> 09:39.933
'cause we heisted
this peace pipe.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.600
- Uh-oh.
- What?

09:41.700 --> 09:43.767
Dude, are you insane?
You can't steal from the museum!

09:43.867 --> 09:45.867
- Shh.
Why not? You did.

09:45.967 --> 09:47.700
- No. I bought this, okay?
I lied about the heist

09:47.800 --> 09:49.267
just so you guys would
stop complaining

09:49.367 --> 09:50.533
and have a little fun.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.067
- Well, we had fun...

09:52.100 --> 09:53.667
stealing, like you said
you were gonna do.

09:53.767 --> 09:54.900
- Yeah.
- Who cares?

09:55.067 --> 09:56.233
Let's just get out of here.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.567
Give me my selfie stick.
Let's go.

09:57.667 --> 10:00.033
- [stammers]
Ohh...

10:00.033 --> 10:00.067
- [stammers]
Ohh...
- Where's my selfie stick?

10:00.067 --> 10:02.000
- Where's my selfie stick?

10:02.100 --> 10:05.367
- Yeah, actually, we kind of
Indiana Jonesed that

10:05.467 --> 10:07.200
at the Native American
exhibit.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.367
- So you left my selfie stick
in there with my phone,

10:10.467 --> 10:11.833
which has a video that says,

10:11.933 --> 10:14.000
"We're going to rob this museum"
on it?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.367
Correct?

10:15.467 --> 10:16.600
- Sah-wee.
- Okay.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.233
- Yeah. We did do that.
- Okay.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.067
- Shoot. That's a bummer.
- Oh, my God, dude.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.667
It's way worse than you think.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.267
- What?
What now?

10:23.367 --> 10:24.700
- My Tamagotchi died.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.500
- Oh, no, you all right?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.500
- No, I'm not okay.
Everything's going wrong.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.267
You know what just happened?
We--we're cursed.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.333
- How are we cursed?
- We smoked the peace pipe

10:33.433 --> 10:34.567
when there's beef in our crew.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.233
That makes it a beef pipe.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.267
That's, like,
Native American 101, dude.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.400
- I did not smoke a beef pipe.
Let it be known.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.733
- Yes, you did, and I smoked the
big beef pipe in his pants,

10:43.833 --> 10:46.000
and it's all going downhill;
we're cursed, man.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.567
- Shh! We do not have time
for this, okay?

10:47.667 --> 10:49.167
We need to get that beef pipe
back in there

10:49.267 --> 10:50.867
and find my phone
before someone else does.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.767
- Oh, we need to squash the beef
and lift the curse.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.367
Otherwise, this stuff's gonna be
going wrong all day.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.033
I can already tell. Lookit.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.667
- If I get my phone, I'll squash
all the beef you want.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.433
- Okay, fine.
- Let's just go to Chili's.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.767
- Your attention, please.
I'm sorry, but since the museum

11:01.867 --> 11:03.567
closes in a half hour,
we're gonna close early

11:03.667 --> 11:05.267
so we can check
the alarm system,

11:05.367 --> 11:07.633
but come back tomorrow with your
ticket stubs for refunds,

11:07.733 --> 11:11.200
and remember, next week:
"A Walk With Dinosaurs"!

11:11.300 --> 11:12.467
Exciting stuff!

11:12.567 --> 11:14.067
- Boo! This guy sucks!

11:14.100 --> 11:15.233
- Shut up. Let's go.
This way.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.500
Go. Go this way. Go.
- Ow!

11:16.600 --> 11:18.500
[beatboxing]

11:21.867 --> 11:24.533
[beatboxing]

11:24.633 --> 11:25.967
- There's gotta be,
like, a side door

11:26.067 --> 11:27.300
we can sneak in or something.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.700
- Yeah, I'm just
trying to massage

11:28.800 --> 11:29.967
the fart out of me
right now.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.533
- Hey, can we focus?

11:31.633 --> 11:33.467
- Jeez, Ders, you almost
scared the fart out of me.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.433
You should do that.
Try to scare the fart out of me.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.133
- I'm not scaring
the fart out of you.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.233
- Fine, then. No more farts.
No more farts in our crew.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.933
We don't get to talk
about farts anymore.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.467
We used to love it.
- Great, yeah.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.167
- You can't block a door.
It's a fire hazard.

11:44.267 --> 11:45.433
Get that out of the way.

11:45.533 --> 11:46.767
- Will you guys
just stop beefing?

11:46.867 --> 11:48.300
We have enough beef
to squash already.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.433
- Do you like farts?
- I love farts.

11:49.533 --> 11:50.667
- Am I in the wrong here?

11:50.767 --> 11:52.067
- No, I'll marry a fart,
I swear to--

11:52.167 --> 11:53.767
Wait.
- What is this?

11:53.867 --> 11:55.133
Is this bamboo?

11:55.233 --> 11:56.433
Is this bamboo?

11:56.533 --> 11:58.133
You imbeciles brought
the wrong shipment!

11:58.233 --> 11:59.600
Do you know how ridiculous
it would be

11:59.700 --> 12:01.433
to have dinosaurs roaming
around in bamboo,

12:01.533 --> 12:04.767
when everyone knows there was no
bamboo in the Cretaceous Period?

12:04.867 --> 12:06.067
- I think it's down this way.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.267
- Okay.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.533
- Hmm.

12:08.633 --> 12:11.867
- [gasps]
Hide, hide!

12:11.967 --> 12:14.233
- So have you ever worked
with dinosaur costumes before?

12:14.333 --> 12:16.367
- No, but I did the
"Sesame Street" live tour,

12:16.467 --> 12:19.400
and the Snuffleupagus puppet
is basically the same size.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.067
- Gone?
- Yeah.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.367
- Oh, my God, that was close.
Okay.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.400
Oh, hide, hide, hide!
- What?

12:31.133 --> 12:33.833
- Yeah, I did background work
on a couple other movies,

12:33.933 --> 12:35.567
but Frank Oz was a nightmare
to work with.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.167
- Oh, Frank's the worst.

12:37.267 --> 12:39.167
- I was finally like,
"You know, life's too short."

12:39.267 --> 12:40.733
- Last time I saw Frank,
I said to myself,

12:40.833 --> 12:43.300
"This man needs to go away,
like, forever."

12:45.833 --> 12:47.767
- Okay, come on.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.567
Dan:
We're starting.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.167
Lisa:
Oh, I left my gloves in the car.

12:52.267 --> 12:54.100
Start without me.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.367
- Oh.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.400
- Okay, the phone's this way.
- Come on, let's go.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.700
- Good idea. Great idea.
- Yeah.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.400
- All right, okay.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.967
Look how good I am at this.
- Get it, get it, get it.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.233
- I can do it
with my eyes closed.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.733
- [shouting]
Open your eyes and get it!

13:07.833 --> 13:09.700
- Okay, Ders, you almost
scared the fart out of me.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.067
I wish.
That'd be awesome.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.633
I've been looking forward
to that fart.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.067
- Yeah, open it please.
- Go, please.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.800
- Come on.
- All right, got it.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.300
- Here you go.
- Give me the phone.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.067
- Okay, look, now you have
your phone, Ders.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.633
Please, will you just
squash the beef?

13:20.733 --> 13:23.633
- Hey, what in the Dark Ages
are you doing?

13:23.733 --> 13:25.233
- Run.
- Run!

13:25.333 --> 13:27.200
- Go!
- Run, run, run!

13:27.300 --> 13:29.200
- Not running.
Not running.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.133
- Come on!

13:33.233 --> 13:35.400
- Where--where
are we going, Ders?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.567
- I don't know.
- Stop!

13:37.667 --> 13:39.267
Get them!
They're bad boys!

13:42.733 --> 13:43.900
- Oh, my God!

13:44.067 --> 13:45.133
Run!

13:45.233 --> 13:46.400
[all screaming]

13:46.500 --> 13:47.633
Go, go, go!

13:47.733 --> 13:48.900
- Let me in! Let me in!

13:49.067 --> 13:50.167
- Ah!

13:53.833 --> 13:56.100
[Adam whimpering]

14:00.267 --> 14:03.667
- Shh!

14:12.800 --> 14:15.067
[both screaming]

14:18.967 --> 14:20.900
- Lock it! Lock it!
Lock it! Lock it!

14:23.133 --> 14:25.667
[all laughing]

14:25.767 --> 14:26.933
- All right!

14:27.067 --> 14:28.800
- Will you guys please come out?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.167
- Never!

14:30.267 --> 14:31.400
- Oh, come on.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.800
We're in the middle
of a rehearsal,

14:32.900 --> 14:34.400
and we need to finish

14:34.500 --> 14:36.200
so we can get over
to the children's hospital.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.533
We're supposed to do

14:37.633 --> 14:38.800
a puppet show
for the sick kids.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.067
- Just come out.
We'll let you go.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.667
We don't even work
for the museum.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.333
- How do we know
it's not a trick?

14:45.433 --> 14:47.267
- I swear on Jim Henson's life.

14:47.367 --> 14:48.833
Come on, please!

14:48.933 --> 14:50.833
We'll let you try on
the dinosaur suits.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.667
- We get to try on the suits.
- Okay, that's cool.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.067
Jim Henson's life.
- Are they safe?

14:54.167 --> 14:55.500
- Are they hot?
Are they breathable?

14:55.600 --> 14:56.733
- Are you serious?
- Okay, okay.

14:56.833 --> 14:57.933
We're coming out.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.400
- Okay, how do you make
the eyes blink?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.767
- Ah, yeah, this is
gonna be cool.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.067
- That's like a really cool--

15:02.167 --> 15:03.933
- Heck, yeah.
- What the [bleep]?

15:04.067 --> 15:05.433
- Hello.
- That's what you get

15:05.533 --> 15:07.067
for ruining our rehearsal,
you idiots.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.333
What kind of
children's hospital

15:08.433 --> 15:10.633
has a dinosaur party
at 8:00 p.m.?

15:10.733 --> 15:12.733
- Okay, don't you throw
logic in my face.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.100
You gave us your word.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.333
- I swore on Jim Henson's life.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.667
- Right.
- Exactly.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.400
- Jim Henson has been dead
for years!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.233
We are all students
of Brian Henson's.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.567
- I should've known that.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.800
- Brian Henson.
- Enough.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.067
- Watch the teeth, buster.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.333
I'll sue you.

15:26.433 --> 15:29.667
both:
Brian Henson! Brian Henson!

15:29.767 --> 15:31.233
Brian Henson!

15:31.333 --> 15:33.267
[beatboxing]

15:37.067 --> 15:39.767
[beatboxing]

15:39.867 --> 15:41.067
[Blake sighs]

15:41.133 --> 15:43.300
- Sit down, and don't move.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.567
- There's only two chairs.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.300
I'm gonna s-stand.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.433
- I hope you little turd boys
like getting arrested,

15:48.533 --> 15:49.767
because I'm calling the police.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.167
- What's with you and turds?

15:51.267 --> 15:52.967
You've got, like,
a weird butthole fixation,

15:53.067 --> 15:55.067
and also a fixation
on little boys.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.533
You're a pedophile.
Ders!

15:56.633 --> 15:58.400
I bet you feel good, don't you?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.767
Because this is, hands down,
the worst Ders Day of all time.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.267
Congratulations.
- Whatever, man.

16:02.367 --> 16:03.967
You didn't even give
Ders Day a chance.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.367
It could've been a nice day
at the museum, but no!

16:05.467 --> 16:07.200
- Three Caucasian men.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.500
They were trying to steal.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.767
- Everything has to be epic.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.133
- Okay, stop yelling.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.433
- Yeah, just chill out, Ders.

16:12.533 --> 16:13.500
- Oh, do you want me to chill?

16:13.600 --> 16:14.833
I thought you wanted to be epic.

16:14.933 --> 16:15.867
Which one do you want,
epic or chill?

16:15.967 --> 16:17.100
- We want, like, a epic chill.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.700
- No, forget about it, man!

16:18.800 --> 16:20.067
I'll be epic
'cause it's Ders Day!

16:20.133 --> 16:21.267
Mother[bleep] Ders Day! Yeah!

16:21.367 --> 16:23.100
[loud flatulence]
- Whoa.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.767
- You just scared the fart
out of me.

16:24.867 --> 16:26.667
- I know, that's why I did that.
Let's go! Come on!

16:26.767 --> 16:29.067
- Hey, get back here!
- Let's go!

16:29.167 --> 16:30.733
- Oh, my God.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.067
[Adam laughing]

16:32.100 --> 16:33.267
What did you eat?

16:33.367 --> 16:34.767
- I don't know.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.433
That's been up there
for a while.

16:36.533 --> 16:37.900
That was in the deep butt.
- The smell!

16:38.067 --> 16:39.167
I can't breathe!

16:39.267 --> 16:41.500
- I'm home!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.367
Oh, happy, epic Ders Day.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.667
My new favorite cape.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.067
[mimics whooshing]

16:46.133 --> 16:48.233
Cool boat! I love it! Yeah!

16:48.333 --> 16:50.533
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

16:50.633 --> 16:53.433
Happy Epic Ders Day,
Erik the Red.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.767
Blake:
Okay, Ders, look,

16:54.867 --> 16:56.567
I think the police
are on their way.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.500
We need to get going, all right?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.867
- Who cares!

17:00.067 --> 17:01.800
We're having fun, right?

17:01.900 --> 17:03.500
- I'm having fun.
Here, here.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
- Why? What are you doing?
- Here, fight me real quick.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.067
- That's cool, that's cool.
- Okay.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.300
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

17:08.400 --> 17:09.600
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

17:09.700 --> 17:10.833
Adam:
Oh, God.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.400
I thought these things were CGI.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.067
- Oh, yeah, that does
not make sense, Adam.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.800
- Oh, my God.
- Ders, look,

17:15.900 --> 17:17.733
I know you're in the middle
of a mental breakdown.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.633
I get that;
sometimes I throw Slipknot on

17:19.733 --> 17:24.067
and rage in the room, but we
need to squash the beef and go.

17:24.100 --> 17:26.800
- Blake, I don't have time
for beef, pal,

17:26.900 --> 17:29.967
because I am a Viking!

17:30.067 --> 17:31.367
To the 'Vo!

17:31.467 --> 17:32.833
- I like Ders
when he's like this.

17:32.933 --> 17:35.300
This is fun.
I feel a little concussed.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.333
[all yelling]

17:41.900 --> 17:43.500
- Hey, dinosaurs,

17:43.600 --> 17:45.633
why don't you go back
to being extinct?

17:45.733 --> 17:47.067
- Yeah!
- Nice.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.200
- Oh, what the hell?

17:49.300 --> 17:50.867
- I'm so sorry.
- We're gonna kick your ass!

17:50.967 --> 17:52.133
- Oh, go, go, go!
- Oh, crap!

17:52.233 --> 17:53.500
[all yelling]

17:53.600 --> 17:54.900
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go, go, go.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.633
- This way.
Ah!

17:56.733 --> 17:58.567
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, man!

17:58.667 --> 18:00.433
- It's the end of the line,
boys.

18:00.533 --> 18:01.433
- Oh, my God.
- He escaped.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.433
- Damn it, we're trapped.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.700
- Wait, there's an exit.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.067
- Oh.
- Ah, it's locked!

18:06.133 --> 18:07.900
- Forget about it,
man, we're toast.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.533
- Put the artifacts down now.

18:09.633 --> 18:10.800
- Okay, yeah.
- Fine.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.200
- Here, there's that.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.533
Guys, I'm sorry
I dragged you here

18:13.633 --> 18:14.967
even though I know
you hate museums,

18:15.067 --> 18:16.367
and I just ruined
another Ders Day,

18:16.467 --> 18:18.067
and now we're gonna
get arrested; great.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.700
- Honestly, it's not even
your fault, dude.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.133
We were just being selfish.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.733
Ders Days, yes, they do suck.
- Usually.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.200
- Admittedly,
they're the worst day.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.600
But like, this was
a pretty fun one.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.100
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.633
Hey, what do you say
we squash the beef?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.467
- I never knew what beef
you were talking about.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.767
- Just the fact that we've
been kind of fighting.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.433
- It's squashed.
- Is it squashed?

18:34.533 --> 18:35.667
- Yeah.
- All right, wait.

18:35.767 --> 18:38.067
One, two, three,
beef squashed!

18:38.100 --> 18:39.633
- You know what,
screw that guy.

18:39.733 --> 18:41.300
Just leave it
blocking the door.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.667
- Come on, man.

18:42.767 --> 18:44.367
We do that and we're
stooping to his level.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.533
That's not what we do
at Anderson Delivery.

18:46.633 --> 18:47.867
Let's move it.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.300
- Yeah, I have three intruders

18:55.400 --> 18:57.133
at the Museum of Science
and History.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.667
Please come down.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.267
- Yeah, you freaking
wish, Saul,

19:00.367 --> 19:02.467
but sorry,
the beef is squashed!

19:02.567 --> 19:04.267
- We squashed the beef!
- Squashed! Squashed!

19:04.367 --> 19:05.667
I'm gonna try it.

19:05.767 --> 19:06.900
Whoa!
- Whoa!

19:07.067 --> 19:08.167
- Ah! It worked!
- Go!

19:08.267 --> 19:09.567
It worked!
It worked!

19:09.667 --> 19:12.600
The spell is broken
and we live again!

19:14.467 --> 19:16.367
- I better never see you
in this museum ever again!

19:16.467 --> 19:19.167
You hear me?
Never again!

19:19.267 --> 19:21.067
Is that a ficus?

19:21.133 --> 19:22.267
[beatboxing]

19:22.367 --> 19:26.533
- * He's insane

19:26.633 --> 19:29.300
[beatboxing]

19:29.400 --> 19:30.733
- Why do we have to
do this again?

19:30.833 --> 19:32.333
- Hey, what--ow!
Ow, there's thorns.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.067
- You guys are gonna find out
what's going on.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.800
Let's just say that Ders Day
is not over yet.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.067
Adam:
Ders Day isn't over yet?

19:37.133 --> 19:38.700
- All I can say is,
it was pretty cool

19:38.800 --> 19:41.067
that, you know, Adam farted
his way out of trouble.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.733
That smelled bad.
- Yeah.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.633
- God, that smelled,
like, medically bad, man.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.800
Like, seriously, you should
get yourself checked out.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.600
I feel like I can
still smell it or something.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.867
- Oh, and the reason for that
is because I did poop my pants.

19:50.967 --> 19:52.400
- Oh, there was some poop
in the toot.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.800
- A ton of it's
actually smeared

19:53.900 --> 19:55.333
on my butt cheeks;
I'm gonna have to

19:55.433 --> 19:57.100
take off my underwear
when we get inside, so.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.467
- Yeah, yeah.
- Also, I realized

19:58.567 --> 20:00.067
something about
Dr. Jerry Larryberry.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.267
- Who's that?
- He was lying to me.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.533
- Obviously.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.233
- He actually was
a real big liar.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.400
I don't even think he was
in the CIA, truthfully.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.767
- I think we knew.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.867
- And he,
um, jerked me off once.

20:10.967 --> 20:12.100
- Oh.
- Obviously, yeah.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.733
That's, like, a no-brainer.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.700
- Ah, that's neither here
nor there, but remember

20:15.800 --> 20:17.733
when I hit that dinosaur
in the head with that sword?

20:17.833 --> 20:19.233
- Yes, yes.
Ders Day has been epic.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.867
- It's about to get
a little bit more epic,

20:20.967 --> 20:22.767
and I'm just
squeezing through you.

20:22.867 --> 20:24.467
- I'm still not fully on board.
- I know you can't see me,

20:24.567 --> 20:26.100
but go ahead and take off
your blindfolds and look up.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.633
- Okay.
- What--where are we?

20:27.733 --> 20:29.100
- Not straight up,
but just kind of up and forward.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.367
- Oh!
- Yeah!

20:30.467 --> 20:31.600
- Oh, Chili's!
- Ooh!

20:31.700 --> 20:32.867
- It's a Ders Day, baby!

20:32.967 --> 20:34.100
It's a Ders Day, baby! Yes!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.400
- Now we're talking.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.933
- Just get in there!
Get in there!

20:37.033 --> 20:39.067
- We should've just came
right here, you idiot.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.867
- Uh, I will take...

20:41.967 --> 20:43.333
three triple dippers.

20:43.433 --> 20:44.700
One of every option, please.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.867
- Yes, and I would like
the steak fajitas.

20:46.967 --> 20:48.833
No beef. Extra squash.

20:48.933 --> 20:50.467
- Nice. Good call.

20:50.567 --> 20:51.933
- And then a order of wings
over buffalo for moi.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.167
- And don't forget the...

20:53.267 --> 20:55.600
* Chili's

20:55.700 --> 20:59.667
all:
* Baby back ribs

20:59.767 --> 21:01.467
* Barbecue sauce

21:01.567 --> 21:03.267
- Okay, you almost forgot
the barbecue sauce!

21:03.367 --> 21:05.067
- So, basically,
one of everything?

21:05.167 --> 21:06.333
- Sure.
- Yeah.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.567
- That works too.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.567
- Just one of everything.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.567
- Nice!

21:14.733 --> 21:15.900
- "Indiana Jonesing."

21:16.067 --> 21:17.133
It's--we replaced it

21:17.233 --> 21:18.867
with a similar sized item.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.100
Your selfie stick.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.400
Thus, countering
the waste displace--

21:22.500 --> 21:23.900
We replaced it
with a similar item.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.200
Your selfie stick.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.800
Thus, countering
the weight dis--dis--

21:26.900 --> 21:27.400
[stammers, laughs]
