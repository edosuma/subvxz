00:02.520 --> 00:05.671
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.036
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.909
Oh, hey, I bet you can't guess
who I met at Janet's house last night.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.911
- Sam, please.
- What?

00:14.120 --> 00:15.712
This is really getting out of hand.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.792
In the month that you've been dating
the lovely Councillor Eldridge

00:18.960 --> 00:21.076
you've done nothing
but drop names.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.271
You'd think you'd never seen
a celebrity before.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.273
So spare me your stargazing.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.193
Hey, hey, Gary Hart.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.668
- Gary Hart, there he is.
- Oh, hey, senator.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.115
Hi, Sam, you left your coat
in my car last night.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.833
That's sweet of you to bring it by.
Thank you.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.076
Least I could do
for a Trivial Pursuit partner.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.515
By the way, thanks for your help
with those sports questions.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.551
Well, that's my strong point.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.517
Thank you for helping me
with everything else.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.314
- That's my strong point.
- Yeah.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.751
Gary.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.793
What say you park her down here,
and I'll buy you a brewski, eh?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.513
Thanks. I think I'll take a rain check.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.870
Oh, well, in that case
you can buy me one.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.880
Just kidding, you know. Sort of.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.119
- Sam, I better run. Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.272
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you. Thanks for dropping by.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.631
Oh, my God, it's Gary Hart.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.638
Did you see Gary Hart?
I saw Gary Hart. Senator Gary Hart.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.792
Could have been President Gary Hart.
Could still be President Gary Hart.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.639
Gary Hart, that's Gary...

01:19.880 --> 01:21.757
I was just showing you
how silly it looks.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.554
Please, don't do it again.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.350
Frasier, it was awfully nice of you
to invite me out for a drink.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.834
Oh, well, it's my pleasure, Jim.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.991
I just couldn't bear
to see you so down in the dumps

02:44.160 --> 02:46.594
after you lost the election.
I thought this might cheer you up.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.076
I'm sure it will.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.358
Woody...

02:52.120 --> 02:53.951
...Iet me get a Scotch on the rocks.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.430
- Oh, well, make that two.
- Coming right up.

02:59.560 --> 03:04.793
Say, aren't you that guy that
Janet Eldridge whipped in the election?

03:05.120 --> 03:08.317
- Woody.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.391
I guess you just look like him.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.679
Did that Fleener guy
take a shellacking or what?

03:20.640 --> 03:22.232
All right.

03:22.880 --> 03:27.351
Jim, you have to look on
the bright side of this.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.839
Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.028
Well, for example, what were the
positive things about your campaign?

03:34.200 --> 03:38.751
Well... Well, of course,
there was Diane.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.876
Diane?

03:42.960 --> 03:46.396
She was wonderful.
She was absolutely wonderful.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.189
You know, a man could go far
with a woman like that at his side.

03:50.360 --> 03:55.514
In fact, now that the campaign is over,
I thought I might ask her out.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.191
Well, I think that's wonderfully
open-minded of you,

03:59.360 --> 04:01.351
considering her operation.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.359
What operation was that?

04:08.240 --> 04:10.959
Well, she had a sex-change operation.
Surely you knew.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.911
Sex change?

04:14.560 --> 04:17.596
No, l, l-- Diane?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.630
Hi, Frasier.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.475
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- Diane, Diane,

04:24.680 --> 04:26.636
what a courageous person you are.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.912
- What are you talking about?
- What a wonderful job they did.

04:30.120 --> 04:35.399
I, l-- Of course, now that I know,
I can tell the difference.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.952
Well, I think I'm gonna be going now.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.749
Bye, Diane.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.793
It's great to see old Jimbo again,
isn't it?

04:48.960 --> 04:52.555
Frasier, have you been telling people
I had a sex-change operation again?

04:55.280 --> 04:58.158
No. He guessed.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.113
Why, thank you, gentlemen.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.550
Well, you look nice too,
Miss Eldridge.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.992
Sam, we didn't expect to see you
here today.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.270
Well, Janet wanted me
to change my tie.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.000
Why don't you sit here.
I think the black one's under the bar.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.435
I just wore this
as a kind of gag anyway.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.073
Good one.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.710
Do you...?
Do you want a white wine?

05:26.920 --> 05:28.831
- I'd love it.
- Fine. Woody, would you do that?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.719
- And a club soda for myself.
- Sure, Sam.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.070
- Hello, Sam.
- Oh, hi.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.800
- My, going formal again.
- Yeah.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.270
You've logged a lot of hours
in the tuxedo lately.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.471
Kind of getting used to
the old monkey suit.

05:43.160 --> 05:48.632
You know, I never realized until now
just how appropriate that nickname is.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.316
That's very funny.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.068
My, aren't we a grumpy primate?

05:56.520 --> 06:01.878
She's jealous you're going to a party
at the mayor's house, and she's not.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.550
As a matter of fact,
I have a wonderful evening planned.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.314
My date Gregory and l
are going to the theatre

06:08.480 --> 06:11.631
and then to a late-night supper
and dancing.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.075
Boy, does that bring back memories.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.840
Oh, are you recalling
a similar evening, Woody?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.474
No, I just remembered your date called
and cancelled.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.796
He said that he had to go on duty
at the hospital,

06:23.960 --> 06:25.439
and that he was really very sorry.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.431
Oh, I'm sorry too, sweetheart.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.712
Well, it's okay. Really.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.395
It's not like I went out and spent $31 2
on a new dress.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.319
Then you'd really feel dumb.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.748
- Evening, everybody.
- Hey, Norm!

06:46.600 --> 06:48.158
What's going down, Mr Peterson?

06:48.360 --> 06:50.555
My cheeks on this barstool.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.871
What's the problem there,
Norm?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.315
Trouble, Cliffie, with a capital D.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.717
Vera's younger sister, Donna,
is coming to visit.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.230
She insists on prancing around
the house wearing next to nothing.

07:05.800 --> 07:11.511
She's always exercising in front of me
in skimpy little leotards and stuff.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.518
She'll shower with the door half open,
right in front of me.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.233
I see your problem here.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.871
Sounds like you got a case
of the frustrated female over there.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.950
I know just what to do.
We'll try a little Acu-Clavin on her.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.474
- Let me go get the car.
- Thank you for changing, Sam.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.438
I mean, it did say on the invitation,
black tie.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.392
Leash optional.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.754
Well, Diane.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.558
The election is long over and
you must be tremendously relieved.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.075
- About what?
- Remember, you were so concerned

07:47.240 --> 07:50.789
I was going to abandon Sam
after he'd served my political purposes.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.349
Obviously you were wrong
about Sam and l.

07:53.800 --> 07:58.510
- Wrong about Sam and me.
- That too.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.597
Excuse me. Sam's waiting.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.636
I'd love to belt you.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.520
Welcome to the losers' club, baby.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.870
Now that you've paid your dues,
here's your membership card.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.234
Yeah, we're a pair, aren't we?

08:27.400 --> 08:29.755
A couple of chumps that life
just kicked in the teeth,

08:29.920 --> 08:32.798
and why am l
talking like Broderick Crawford?

08:35.440 --> 08:41.629
Frasier, I know you think I'm jealous
of Janet and Sam's relationship,

08:41.799 --> 08:43.232
but I'm not.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.956
I just don't want to see him get hurt.
That's really all there is to it.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.755
I think you're kidding yourself, Diane.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.990
We both know the reason
you've been down in the dumps.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.991
But believe me,
there's no need to be.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.913
Sam is not really happy
with that woman.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.517
Imagine the mental strain it must be
trying to use the right fork all the time.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.113
Don't give up hope. I haven't.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.549
You're a lovely man.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.994
I'm sorry I hurt you.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.271
I wish there was some way
I could make you forgive me.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.355
Well, marry me. Bear my children.
Let me die in your arms.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.276
I was thinking more along the lines
of making fudge.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.311
Well, I like your fudge.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.638
- Hey, Diane, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.910
I'm gonna shut off the light
and lock you in.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.793
- Okay.
- Don't forget to cover the pool table.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.758
- Okay.
- Make sure you pull your arms off

09:50.920 --> 09:54.230
- and stuff them down your throat.
- Okay.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.396
What did...?

10:04.280 --> 10:07.511
I'm sorry, honey. Let me just check
and make sure Woody remembered.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.989
Go ahead.
I know it's had you preoccupied.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.555
You hardly slept a wink
during the mayor's entire speech.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.109
Oh, darn it, Woody.
I knew he'd forget.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.159
He forgot to leave the check
for the beer man.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.117
Or did I forget to tell him?

10:24.280 --> 10:27.590
No, no, no,
he forgot to remind me to tell him.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.758
- That's what it was.
- Did you have a good time tonight?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.714
I had a great time.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.472
- That was nice.
- Yeah, nice in a great sort of way.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.433
By the way, wasn't it funny
running into one of your old girlfriends

10:56.600 --> 10:58.750
- working for the caterer tonight?
- Was that weird?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.593
- What are the odds on that?
- Pretty good, I'd say.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.069
We run into your girlfriends
all over town.

11:04.240 --> 11:09.268
I'd like to point out that we didn't
see one in the limo on the way home.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.795
What's the longest relationship
you've ever had, Sam?

11:23.200 --> 11:29.036
Oh, let's see. I went out with
one person there for a whole year.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.159
- Mind if I ask who she was?
- No, not at all. Any time.

11:33.320 --> 11:38.394
Oh, right, you're asking now.
Well, all right.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.871
You're not gonna believe this.

11:42.040 --> 11:45.794
Nobody did.
I mean, I even have trouble believing it.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.838
It was Diane.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.399
Unbelievable, huh?

11:51.560 --> 11:54.472
No, actually it explains
quite a few things.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.993
Well, that's... That's Diane for you.
Unbelievable and explaining things.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.917
But anyway, that's all over now.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.717
Since things are over
between you and Diane,

12:09.880 --> 12:13.919
- I wonder why she still works here.
- Why, she's gotta work someplace.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.270
Does she owe you money
she's trying to work off?

12:16.440 --> 12:17.589
No.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.312
Would you lose customers
if she leaves?

12:20.520 --> 12:24.559
No. As a matter of fact, I'd probably
get a few back if I did let her go.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.310
Sam, nobody said anything
about letting her go,

12:28.480 --> 12:31.358
but, as a matter of fact,
you might be doing her a favour.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.318
Unless, of course, there are still
feelings left between you two

12:34.480 --> 12:36.038
that I should know about.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.397
Don't be silly. Of course not.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.155
I'm glad to hear that.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.669
You know how much I care for you.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.230
What are we doing here?
Let's go home.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.231
Listen, don't worry about that.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.311
Diane is probably staying here

12:54.480 --> 12:56.948
because she thinks
that I can't do without her.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.874
- Sam?
- Yeah?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.072
Do you really think
that talented, bright, lovely woman

13:03.240 --> 13:05.515
belongs in a bar serving drinks?

13:10.320 --> 13:13.118
I guess not.
I mean, no, of course not.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.232
Maybe she just needs a friendly shove
out of the nest.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.795
I hadn't thought about that before,
in that way.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.639
The sooner you do it, the sooner
she'll be out of this dead-end job

13:22.800 --> 13:24.916
and on to something
a lot more meaningful in her life.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.756
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Oh, Sam, what am I doing?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.195
I'm not being honest.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.071
The truth is...

13:34.640 --> 13:37.029
...I'm just not comfortable
with Diane working here.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.478
I mean, you've had a past with her.
And I'm as insecure as anybody.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.318
Are you saying that you think
I should fire her?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.476
Sam, it's not my business.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.315
And I'm not trying to interfere.
But if I were you,

13:53.480 --> 13:56.233
I'd do it right away.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.119
Tomorrow.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.912
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Why not?

14:04.920 --> 14:09.835
Yeah, why not? I mean, tomorrow
is as good as any time, I guess.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.716
Hey, Carla?
Carla, is Diane here yet?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.718
No, Diane is not here yet.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.235
That is the third time
you've asked me that.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.278
Why would you, or anyone
for that matter, want to see her?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.789
Well... Just curious. No reason.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.679
Well, when she gets here,
I'll make an announcement, okay?

14:49.960 --> 14:52.030
What's your problem?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.599
Carla...

14:54.240 --> 14:59.234
...has it ever occurred to you
that Diane doesn't really belong here?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.749
You mean this bar or this planet?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.752
Either way, it's yes.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.395
Sometimes I think this place
just isn't good enough

15:06.560 --> 15:08.152
for somebody like her, you know?

15:08.320 --> 15:12.393
I mean, she's a cocktail waitress.
That's a dead-end job.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.636
There's no future, no reward.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.435
She, she's-- She's a junior
cocktail waitress.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.070
You are a senior cocktail waitress.
There's a big difference.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.510
Listen, Sam,
I know what this is all about.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.398
You're not really that serious
about this Eldridge babe, are you?

15:30.640 --> 15:33.359
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how serious I am.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.717
But I do know that I'm having
the best time of my life.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.158
And as you know,
my life has been wall-to-wall fun.

15:42.400 --> 15:47.349
She's smart, but at the same time
she doesn't make me feel not smart.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.596
I feel important when I'm around her.
I like that.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.591
- Oh, puke.
- What?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.874
Will you cut it out? I mean, that is
the sappiest junk I've ever heard.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.555
Look, you've proven your point. You
can go out with classy dames like her.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.756
You can go out with anybody.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.353
Now, you've had your fun.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.557
I want you to just quit fooling around,
march right out there,

16:06.720 --> 16:09.837
and find yourself
an airhead with big casabas.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.271
What the heck
has gotten into you, Carla?

16:14.480 --> 16:17.836
Sammy, it's just not right.
You are not a one-woman guy.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.953
I mean, it's like the time
of your great sickness.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.353
- When I went out with Diane.
- That's right.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.399
You're starting to get me worried.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.949
No, no, no, you're nuts.
You're nuts, Carla.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.830
When Diane gets here,
say something.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.471
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

16:41.000 --> 16:43.195
Hey, Mr Peterson.
Can I pour you a beer?

16:43.400 --> 16:46.392
Well, okay, Woody,
but be sure to stop me at one.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.875
Make that 1 :30.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.636
So, Normie,
did Vera's sister, Donna, show?

16:55.800 --> 16:59.759
Yeah, she showed all right, Cliff.
She showed plenty.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.352
Well, don't tell me she's still
prancing around in her Skivvies, eh.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.592
All right, listen to this.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.837
I have to go to the room
to get something, right? So I knock.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.434
Once, twice, no answer.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.874
So in I go, right?

17:15.200 --> 17:20.319
There she is, sitting on the bed,
doing her nails, buck-naked.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.911
Buck?

17:23.280 --> 17:25.031
Totally buck.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.395
She tried to cover herself up,
but believe me,

17:27.560 --> 17:29.676
an emery board doesn't hide much.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.398
My nerves are just frazzled.
I don't know what I should do, Cliffie.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.438
Well, I've got you covered here,
Normie. You need to relax.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.875
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Relax.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.758
- Right.
- Yeah, see, why don't you and l

17:42.920 --> 17:45.593
go over to your house
and watch some tube, eh?

17:48.520 --> 17:50.670
Cheers. Oh, just a minute.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.350
It's for you, Mr Peterson.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.752
Oh, hey, Miss Chambers.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.031
Hello, Woody.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.670
- Where's Sam?
- He's in his office.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.149
- He's dying to see you.
- Do you have an envelope

18:05.320 --> 18:06.958
behind the bar, Woody?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.758
Oh, Normie, you're as white
as a sheet. What's cooking?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.751
Oh, that was Vera.
Her aunt's taken sick.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.195
She has to go to Springfield
for a few days.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.039
That leaves me at home alone
with Donna.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.397
Just you and the siren.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.718
Hey, Mr Peterson,
maybe you can use that siren thing

18:26.880 --> 18:28.677
to scare off your sister-in-law.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.430
- Hi, Diane.
- Hello, Frasier.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.989
Oh, say, what--?
What's the matter with you?

18:41.840 --> 18:43.796
Sam thinks he's going to fire me.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.996
But I have a little surprise for him.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.310
- I'm resigning.
- You're leaving Cheers?

18:48.520 --> 18:49.953
- That's right.
- Well, great.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.957
You can work for me.
I need a new receptionist.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.198
Frasier, you have
a wonderful receptionist.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.432
Mrs McGrady has worked for you
and your family for 20 years.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.996
Well, yes, but I caught her in a typo
the other day, so she's history.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.549
- Thank you, Frasier. I don't think so.
- Okay, but one word from you

19:06.720 --> 19:08.711
and that blue-haired head rolls.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.839
Is she here yet? Oh, good, good.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.718
You're just the person I wanna see.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.759
Sweetheart, you are far too bright,
talented and lovely to waste your--

19:19.920 --> 19:22.957
Before you go any further, read this.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.551
All right.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.275
Well, does this--?
Does this mean you're quitting?

19:48.560 --> 19:52.075
Isn't that what it clearly states
on page five?

19:55.080 --> 19:57.799
But why?
I mean, I don't understand why.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.959
My reasons are enumerated here
above the graph.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.548
Oh. Oh, well, this--
This is great.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.352
I mean, it's not great. It's awful.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.478
But I mean it's, well, it's great for you.
Don't you think?

20:12.640 --> 20:14.915
I mean, it's probably
best for everybody in the long run.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.991
Personally, I feel awful about this.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.393
I know what you were going to do.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.516
You were going to fire me.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.913
What makes you say that?

20:26.320 --> 20:29.118
Let's just say a woman knows.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.437
You were going to fire me.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.473
And what have I done?
I've made it easier for you.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.798
People have always made
things easier for you.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.997
Well, I'm not going to let you
off the hook.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.149
I withdraw my resignation.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.313
Fire me, if you can.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.038
But I don't think you have the guts.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.834
After all we've gone through,
the good times and the bad,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.515
I say you don't have the courage
to fire me to my face.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.032
- You're fired.
- Too late. I resign.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.872
No, you can't do that.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.640
No, you took back your resignation
and you dared me to fire you.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.190
No, you can't do that.
You're fired. I did it.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.676
The last time we had
an official parting of the ways

21:08.840 --> 21:11.434
there was some question
as to who left whom.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.434
That is why this time I've gone to
the trouble of tendering my resignation

21:15.600 --> 21:19.479
in the written form. Legal precedent
states that the written document

21:19.640 --> 21:22.916
always supersedes
the spoken word,

21:23.120 --> 21:24.678
especially when it's spoken
by a goof.

21:24.880 --> 21:29.032
Oh, fine. Fine. Who cares?
See you in the funny papers.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.352
Oh, that's perfect. The funny papers.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.879
Don't say another word.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.474
Let that be the last utterance
I remember.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.359
And now I'm off to begin a new life.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.910
- I shall forget you in a trice.
- Oh, a trice?

21:44.080 --> 21:47.834
Please, let that be the last word
I hear from you.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.638
You troglodyte.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.394
That's even better!

21:54.920 --> 21:58.071
Attention, everyone.
May I have your attention, please?

21:59.480 --> 22:01.072
I have resigned.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.152
I know this comes as a shock,
but I've decided

22:04.320 --> 22:07.710
that I no longer fit into
the scheme of things around here.

22:07.920 --> 22:12.994
I go willingly with a gladful heart, for it
has been my pleasure to serve you,

22:13.400 --> 22:17.473
and my privilege to know you,
lo, these many years.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.914
I shall miss you all.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.389
But weep no tears
for Diane Chambers.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.912
She's tougher than you think.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.119
She's going to be okay.
You bet she is.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.158
So this is goodbye.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.632
For there's one thing I know:
You will never, ever see me again.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.277
Farewell.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.192
Hey, look, everyone. It's Diane.
