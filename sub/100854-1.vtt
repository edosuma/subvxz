01:53.413 --> 01:54.414
10 please.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.188
I like your costume.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.457
Thanks, I was going to cosplay
as Urahara from "Bleach",

02:03.490 --> 02:05.026
but I couldn't
find the right hat.

02:05.059 --> 02:06.994
I tried to dye
green streaks in it,

02:07.028 --> 02:08.930
but then the whole
thing turned green,

02:08.963 --> 02:10.764
so I went with Naruto instead.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.555
Mister Nimoy?

02:37.692 --> 02:38.960
Mister Nimoy?

02:40.962 --> 02:42.063
Mister Nimoy?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.199
Mister Nimoy?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.117
Shit.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.451
Hello?

03:38.485 --> 03:39.854
Heather, Your brother's here.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.524
Uncle Jeffrey.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.592
Uncle Jeffrey.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.195
I'm your Uncle, I want respect.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.463
Okay look, I brought
toys for you, look.

03:50.497 --> 03:53.366
This, I just directed that,
okay you can have that one.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.302
No fighting.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.771
This one I just voiced, okay.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.539
And this one I voiced,
wrote and directed.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.709
You don't care, goodbye.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.710
Hi.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.945
Hey, how's it going Heather?

04:03.978 --> 04:05.246
Hey buddy.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.280
What buddy?

04:06.314 --> 04:07.514
I don't want any books.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.582
Okay.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.251
I have to feed the baby,
we'll catch up later.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.786
All right, I'll talk
to you later, bye.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.387
Hey Rob, what's up?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.823
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

04:15.857 --> 04:19.160
Cool, hey can I talk
to you afterwards?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.027
For a minute?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.497
Okay, good talk.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.239
I can't, I
just don't have it.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.975
Just to get
me through the summer.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.010
What about NFL Films?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.645
You won an Emmy with them.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.146
Surely they can find
something for you.

04:39.180 --> 04:41.481
That was 20 years ago.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.718
Everyone I know there is gone,

04:43.751 --> 04:44.551
or dead.

04:46.087 --> 04:47.989
Just go back to anime.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.991
You're a superstar
in that world.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.826
Actor, writer, director.

04:51.859 --> 04:52.760
Jeff Nimoy.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.163
Yeah.

04:56.197 --> 04:57.597
It's complicated.

04:57.632 --> 04:59.066
It's complicated?

04:59.100 --> 05:00.601
You know what else
is complicated?

05:00.635 --> 05:01.969
My checkbook's complicated.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.406
Let me direct one
of your reality shows.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.975
Also complicated.

05:08.009 --> 05:08.910
You don't have the credits,

05:08.943 --> 05:10.211
you know I can't do that.

05:10.244 --> 05:13.381
If you gave me a show
I'd have the credits.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.183
If it were up to
me, I would, really.

05:16.217 --> 05:17.652
But it's not, I have bosses.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.654
Go back to anime.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.324
I just can't.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.327
Then I can't help you.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.595
I'm leaving.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.331
Okay.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.799
Bye.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.833
Bye.

05:32.867 --> 05:33.768
Bye.

05:33.801 --> 05:34.702
You okay?

05:35.937 --> 05:36.938
Fine, I just like,

05:38.005 --> 05:39.140
do you have any Xanax?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.908
I have like no
insurance right now.

05:40.942 --> 05:43.644
Yeah, left-hand
side, middle drawer.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.247
How many do you need?

05:46.280 --> 05:47.815
As many as you can spare.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.183
Okay, well
don't take the whole thing.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.819
I need them until the
kids are back to school.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.653
Good?

05:52.687 --> 05:54.288
Okay, take those.

05:55.957 --> 05:57.457
Why do you need so much Xanax?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.094
Well I don't know, Heather.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.263
Why would I need Xanax?

06:02.296 --> 06:04.265
Okay well, just be careful.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.234
Bye buddy.

06:07.268 --> 06:08.836
Bye.

06:08.869 --> 06:09.937
What's my name?

06:09.971 --> 06:10.905
Nimoy.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.807
Say, Uncle Jeffrey.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.674
Nimoy!

06:14.809 --> 06:15.943
Leonard Nimoy.

06:18.980 --> 06:19.880
Love you, buddy.

06:19.914 --> 06:22.582
Bye, love you too, bye.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.451
Bye.

06:24.919 --> 06:25.753
Eat something.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.132
This is Jeff.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.567
Hello, I'm
looking for Jeff Nimoy?

06:40.601 --> 06:42.003
Who's this?

06:42.036 --> 06:44.238
Kyle Bailey,
I'm with Geek Kon.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.008
Oh, hi.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.110
Am I catching
you at a bad time?

06:49.143 --> 06:51.679
Oh, no.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.381
Great, well
if you remember,

06:53.414 --> 06:55.216
we had you at our
anime convention

06:55.249 --> 06:57.418
here in Madison, Wisconsin
about 10 years ago,

06:57.451 --> 06:58.886
and we were wondering
if you'd like

06:58.919 --> 07:01.521
to be a VIP guest
again this weekend?

07:01.554 --> 07:02.957
This weekend?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.558
Yeah, we had a voice
director recently cancel

07:05.592 --> 07:07.228
and we need a big name

07:07.261 --> 07:10.031
for our voice acting
workshop and director panel.

07:10.064 --> 07:11.966
Are you available?

07:11.999 --> 07:16.437
I don't know, I don't really
do anime conventions anymore.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.006
In fact, I think the
last one I did was yours,

07:19.040 --> 07:20.441
10 years ago.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.309
Well, cons have
certainly changed since then.

07:22.343 --> 07:23.543
Oh yeah?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.112
From what I remember
it's just a free trip

07:25.146 --> 07:26.714
to meet a handful of fans.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.783
Well, true
the trip is free,

07:28.816 --> 07:31.352
like all cons we provide
your airfare and hotel room,

07:31.385 --> 07:33.988
but you may not realize
that now cons do things...

07:34.021 --> 07:36.023
Plus you know,
anime conventions,

07:36.057 --> 07:38.959
there's all that
handshaking, and hugging.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.929
Lots of germ transference.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.166
Well, one change is
we supply hand sanitizer now,

07:45.199 --> 07:46.967
so I don't think
you need to worry.

07:48.402 --> 07:51.205
Yeah, well unless there's
some other major changes,

07:51.238 --> 07:53.474
I think it's a hard pass.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.443
Well, I was
trying to tell you,

07:55.476 --> 07:58.212
the major change is we
now pay appearance fees.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.314
Cons are a lot bigger
than they used to be.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.850
How does three
thousand dollars sound?

08:04.285 --> 08:05.286
Mister Nimoy?

08:06.454 --> 08:07.988
Mister Nimoy?

08:08.022 --> 08:10.724
Oh, you wanted Jeff Nimoy?

08:12.927 --> 08:15.362
Hold on, let me get him.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.306
Jeff Nimoy.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.162
Hi, I'm Jeff Nimoy.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.297
Yes, I know.

08:50.331 --> 08:53.100
I recognize you from
your Wikipedia page.

08:53.134 --> 08:54.034
What's your name?

08:54.068 --> 08:55.803
Oh of course, I'm Bobbi.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.037
Hi Bobbi, nice to meet you.

08:57.071 --> 08:58.973
Nice to meet you.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.974
Shall we go?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.742
Oh, sorry I'm nervous.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.612
I just have never met
a big star before.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.346
It's okay, I'm
not such a big star.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.547
Don't be nervous.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.283
Yes you are, you're like
the Steven Spielberg of anime.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.820
Okay, at least the
Ed Wood of anime.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.923
Can I get your bag?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.158
No, don't be silly.

09:17.191 --> 09:19.226
No, you are a VIP,
you deserve the best.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.061
Okay.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.199
Trigun is like
my favorite anime,

09:25.232 --> 09:26.734
and Wolfwood is definitely

09:26.767 --> 09:28.169
my favorite character
of all time.

09:28.202 --> 09:31.138
When he died I cried
like a little baby.

09:31.172 --> 09:34.041
I cried too, when he
died I was out of a job.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.443
Of course I prefer the
Japanese sub-titled version,

09:36.477 --> 09:38.112
but I don't think
that Sho Hayami

09:38.145 --> 09:39.313
did as good of a job

09:39.346 --> 09:40.915
at capturing Wolfwood's
essence as you did.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.383
And your voice is much smokier,

09:42.416 --> 09:43.784
which makes sense,

09:43.817 --> 09:45.686
because as you know
Wolfwood is a chain-smoker.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.656
You know, that
bag is on rollers.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.924
You could just put
it down and pull it.

09:50.925 --> 09:51.825
Of course.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.861
Yeah, that's how it works.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.362
Been that way for a long time.

09:55.396 --> 09:56.697
Anyway, what an amazing
character Wolfwood was,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.899
I mean a hard-drinking,
chain-smoking,

09:58.933 --> 10:01.035
womanizing, perverted priest.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.303
Typecasting I guess.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.739
Wolfwood is 30, or maybe 40,

10:07.007 --> 10:08.242
the characteristic
art style emerged...

10:08.275 --> 10:09.644
Oh, Mister Nimoy!

10:09.678 --> 10:10.844
You made it!

10:10.878 --> 10:12.146
Kyle Bailey, we
spoke on the phone.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.214
Hi Kyle.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.653
I see you met Bobbi.

10:18.687 --> 10:20.187
Oh yes.

10:20.221 --> 10:22.823
She's quite the
encyclopedia of anime.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.091
I'm a bit of a savant.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.728
Bobbi will be your
handler all weekend.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.596
Great.

10:30.431 --> 10:33.267
So is this pretty much
the way you remember it?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.537
It smells the same.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.041
When you wear the same
costume for four days in a row,

10:41.075 --> 10:43.544
sometimes things tend
to get a little, ripe.

10:43.577 --> 10:44.511
Yeah.

10:44.545 --> 10:46.313
We call that, otaku funk.

10:47.682 --> 10:48.949
Lovely.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.985
It gets far worse by Sunday.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.187
As will my germophobia.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.589
But I guess for 3000 dollars
I can put up with it.

10:55.624 --> 10:57.391
As long as they
don't try to hug me.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.593
They will.

10:59.628 --> 11:00.427
They will.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.232
Hey,

11:06.400 --> 11:09.303
can I possibly,
can I get my check?

11:10.471 --> 11:12.741
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry.

11:15.242 --> 11:15.976
That's not it.

11:17.378 --> 11:18.946
That I even have to ask.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.780
There you go buddy.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.148
Thanks, I'm sorry.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.483
A little bit embarrassing.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.084
No, no problem,
no problem at all.

11:24.118 --> 11:27.321
Okay, so you seem
to be taken care of.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.222
Enjoy your stay.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.056
Thanks.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.157
I hope you like your room.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.259
Thanks very much.

11:32.293 --> 11:32.993
Shall we?

11:33.027 --> 11:34.128
Yeah, it'll be just a sec.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.296
The elevator.

11:35.329 --> 11:36.765
Thanks.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.633
Okay so, this is your room.

11:38.667 --> 11:39.900
Okay.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.235
And you have my number,

11:41.268 --> 11:44.338
so if you need anything
just text me, call me.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.607
Do you need anything?

11:45.640 --> 11:48.610
Not unless you have
any Xanax.

11:48.643 --> 11:49.977
Sure.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.278
How many do you need?

11:52.146 --> 11:54.081
As many as you can spare.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.250
Take the whole thing,
I've got more at home.

11:57.686 --> 11:58.485
Gee thanks.

11:58.519 --> 11:59.621
No problem.

11:59.654 --> 12:01.690
Do you need anything else?

12:01.723 --> 12:03.457
I don't, but if I do,

12:03.490 --> 12:05.492
I'll call you, or text you.

12:05.526 --> 12:06.460
Okay.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.494
Okay, I've got your number.

12:07.528 --> 12:08.329
Yeah.

12:08.362 --> 12:09.163
Okay, goodnight.

12:09.196 --> 12:09.997
Bye.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.734
You're gonna
watch me go inside?

12:12.767 --> 12:13.967
Yeah, I just want to make sure

12:14.001 --> 12:15.235
you get in okay, that's my job.

12:15.269 --> 12:16.738
Sure, okay.

12:16.771 --> 12:18.138
I've been going through
doors since I'm 30 though,

12:18.172 --> 12:19.406
so I know what I'm doing.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.075
I know, sometimes
the keys are tricky.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.343
Okay, goodbye.

12:22.376 --> 12:23.410
Bye.

12:23.444 --> 12:24.278
Sleep well.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.479
Okay.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.181
Don't let the lady
spiders bite.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.116
Goodbye.

12:29.149 --> 12:29.983
Bye.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.921
But you're still here
is what I'm saying.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.056
I'll go.

12:36.090 --> 12:36.890
I just.

12:36.924 --> 12:37.726
Goodnight.

12:37.759 --> 12:38.559
Goodnight.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.493
Sorry.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.695
You've got a room
too though, don't you?

12:40.729 --> 12:41.395
Yeah, yeah.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.463
Okay I'll see you later.

12:42.496 --> 12:43.297
Okay.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.131
Okay bye.

12:44.164 --> 12:44.965
Okay bye.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.800
Go away.

12:45.834 --> 12:46.668
Goodbye.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.171
Hello Madison Geek
Kon, how you doing?

13:58.939 --> 13:59.973
Good to see you again.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.175
You too, man.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.310
Did you know you were the
first actor I ever hired in LA?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.813
No way, really?

14:04.846 --> 14:05.946
You mean that Arnold
Schwarzenegger thing?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.114
Oh my God you remember it?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.348
Of course I do.

14:08.382 --> 14:10.050
It was Arnold
Schwarzenegger as,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.152
he was a short order cook.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.420
It's like, put
down the short ribs,

14:13.454 --> 14:14.689
what are you doing?

14:14.722 --> 14:16.858
That's not barbecue
sauce, it's blood.

14:16.891 --> 14:19.226
You remember every
line, it's insane.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.061
Of course man,
that was a classic.

14:21.094 --> 14:21.896
Oh my God.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.564
All two episodes.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.199
I'm surprised it
lasted that long.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.066
I know.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.469
Do you do many cons?

14:28.502 --> 14:30.504
Yeah yeah, I do
quite a few actually.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.673
I do this one every year.

14:31.706 --> 14:32.640
Oh really?

14:32.674 --> 14:34.141
Yeah, I've got some
family here in Madison,

14:34.174 --> 14:35.409
so it's a good excuse for me

14:35.442 --> 14:36.811
to get a free trip
to see everybody.

14:36.845 --> 14:38.045
That's smart, good for you.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.279
I miss working with you.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.081
You too man, it's been great.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.784
No one will hire me.

14:43.651 --> 14:44.551
Oh shit, that's me.

14:44.585 --> 14:46.019
I gotta go, see you later.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.094
Whoa, has it been
a year already?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.366
Damn, they'll let
anybody in here.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.735
Jeff Nimoy!

15:02.637 --> 15:03.805
Brian Donovan.

15:03.838 --> 15:05.439
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.541
Dude, what rock did you
crawl out from under?

15:07.574 --> 15:08.475
How long has it been, man?

15:08.509 --> 15:09.811
I don't know, when did we wrap

15:09.844 --> 15:12.346
that crappy anime series
I directed you in?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.448
Don't laugh too hard,
it's still on TV somewhere.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.918
That's why I keep getting
invited to these things.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.120
We polished that
turd pretty good then.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.390
Hey man, I've been
looking around.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.425
I can't believe how
the money's changed.

15:25.459 --> 15:27.394
There's like some serious
big business going on here.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
Tell me about it, brother.

15:28.462 --> 15:29.664
This is all I do know.

15:29.697 --> 15:31.131
Really?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.499
Seriously man, I travel
almost every weekend,

15:32.533 --> 15:33.668
and I make a fortune.

15:33.701 --> 15:35.202
Dude, sign me up.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.136
Right?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.705
No I'm not kidding, I need it.

15:37.739 --> 15:39.439
Hello, Brian Donovan.

15:39.473 --> 15:40.340
Hey you.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.778
I was wondering
when I'd see you.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.279
Hey Jeff, do you
know Nikki Boyer?

15:45.312 --> 15:46.213
No I don't.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.147
Nik, this is Jeff Nimoy.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.716
Yeah, of course I know you.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.986
I'm your biggest fan.

15:52.020 --> 15:52.854
Yeah, right?

15:54.856 --> 15:56.123
Oh, she's being serious.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.225
Oh I'm sorry, that's sweet.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.526
Thank you.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.695
No seriously,

16:00.728 --> 16:01.829
I really am.

16:01.863 --> 16:02.997
Why don't you work more?

16:03.031 --> 16:03.865
Oh, burn.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.868
No no, that is
not what I meant.

16:06.901 --> 16:07.769
Oh God.

16:07.802 --> 16:08.736
That's what she meant.

16:08.770 --> 16:10.270
No it's okay, I
know what you meant,

16:10.304 --> 16:11.438
don't listen to him.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.141
Mister Brian Donovan.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.576
Oh shit, that's me.

16:15.610 --> 16:16.778
Bye.

16:20.815 --> 16:23.952
What do you say,
Madison, Wisconsin?

16:23.985 --> 16:24.819
Geek Kon.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.925
So, you're an actress?

16:30.959 --> 16:33.061
Yeah, a voice actress.

16:33.093 --> 16:33.928
Yeah I.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.229
Right.

16:36.263 --> 16:39.601
Sorry, I get a little
flustered around celebrities.

16:39.634 --> 16:41.970
Oh come on, you really
think I'm a celebrity?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.940
Yeah, you're like
the biggest name here.

16:45.974 --> 16:46.975
Get outta here.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.510
You are, I mean to me, anyway.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.748
You should be my agent.

16:53.781 --> 16:55.717
Nikki Boyer.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.451
Oh shoot, that's me.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.820
Nice to see you, I'll
see you up there.

16:58.853 --> 17:00.655
Okay, go knock 'em dead.

17:04.558 --> 17:05.792
Hi everybody.

17:05.827 --> 17:08.395
Oh my gosh, I am so,
so happy to be here,

17:08.428 --> 17:09.998
and I'm so grateful
because honestly,

17:10.031 --> 17:11.263
I just want to thank the fans,

17:11.298 --> 17:13.001
because if it
weren't for you guys,

17:13.034 --> 17:14.836
I would not be where I am today.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.336
So thank you so much,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.505
I can't wait to meet each and
every one of you on the con.

17:19.807 --> 17:20.907
Nikki Boyer.

17:20.942 --> 17:22.342
Mister Nimoy, are you ready?

17:22.376 --> 17:23.276
You're next.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.979
Yeah, I'm rarin' to go.

17:25.012 --> 17:26.781
Awesome, have fun!

17:26.814 --> 17:27.648
Thanks.

17:28.783 --> 17:30.785
He is a superstar
in the voice world.

17:30.818 --> 17:33.387
You know him from Trigun,
you know him from Digimon,

17:33.420 --> 17:36.223
you know him from
everything, Jeff Nimoy.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.360
Oh shit, that's me.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.409
You guys, you
guys are too kind.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.744
Thank you so much.

17:56.778 --> 17:59.212
Many of you I guess
know me from Digimon.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.213
I played Tentomon.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.884
A lot of you also know me as,

18:02.917 --> 18:04.919
Nicholas D Wolfwood from Trigun.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.489
I see we have a Wolfwood
cosplayer right here.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.224
Anyway, it's been a long time

18:11.258 --> 18:12.660
since I've been to
one of these cons,

18:12.694 --> 18:15.328
and I'm really looking forward
to meeting a lot of you,

18:15.362 --> 18:17.999
and signing some autographs.

18:18.032 --> 18:19.701
If you want a
handshake or a hug,

18:21.169 --> 18:23.303
on request only, please.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.239
Please bathe.

18:28.743 --> 18:29.576
Thanks.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.852
Jeff Nimoy.

18:37.885 --> 18:38.720
Jeff Nimoy.

18:40.188 --> 18:43.157
Let's hear it for all of our
voice actor all-stars, huh?

18:51.733 --> 18:53.000
Hey hey hey.

18:53.034 --> 18:55.302
There's the man.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.137
How's it going?

18:56.170 --> 18:57.805
Good, I'm here.

18:57.839 --> 18:58.740
You're over there.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.843
Hey man, how much are you
charging for your autographs?

19:01.876 --> 19:04.212
I think we should charge
the same, don't you think?

19:04.244 --> 19:05.747
I don't know, free?

19:06.714 --> 19:08.049
Dude, you have to charge.

19:08.082 --> 19:09.917
Believe me, these
kids want to pay.

19:09.951 --> 19:11.318
This is their super bowl baby.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.820
And they save up all year,

19:12.854 --> 19:14.655
just so they can meet their
favorite voice actor, like me,

19:14.689 --> 19:15.990
and buy stuff from them.

19:17.892 --> 19:19.060
I'm more of a
director though really.

19:19.093 --> 19:20.494
I don't know,
it doesn't matter.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.729
You've played plenty of voices,

19:21.763 --> 19:24.397
and you've directed the
biggest shows, right?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.666
What did they used to call you?

19:25.700 --> 19:27.168
The George Lucas of
anime or some shit.

19:27.201 --> 19:29.503
Spielberg actually, but
I'll take George Lucas.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.172
Actually I'm more
of a Scorsese type.

19:31.205 --> 19:32.607
For a con this size,

19:32.640 --> 19:33.941
we should probably charge
like 20 bucks a pop.

19:33.975 --> 19:34.942
Really?

19:34.976 --> 19:35.777
Yeah man.

19:35.810 --> 19:36.778
Nine times out of 10,

19:36.811 --> 19:38.311
they sell it on Ebay
to the highest bidder.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.248
You might as well
take your cut, baby.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.984
What do you do, just
take the money yourself?

19:43.017 --> 19:44.852
Yeah sure, or you get
your guest relations kid

19:44.886 --> 19:46.087
to handle it for you.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.221
That's why they're
called handlers.

19:48.122 --> 19:49.289
Are you sure this is legal?

19:49.322 --> 19:50.691
Hell yeah.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.862
Okay, if you say
so, 20 bucks it is.

19:54.896 --> 19:56.063
Damn, if this works,

19:56.097 --> 19:57.799
I'm gonna sell my
autograph on Ebay too!

19:57.832 --> 20:00.268
Oh, I'll be the
first bidder baby.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.103
Set it up, set it up.

20:32.266 --> 20:34.101
Digi-armor energize.

20:49.884 --> 20:52.352
Yes, you want me to sign that?

20:52.385 --> 20:53.187
Okay.

20:54.689 --> 20:55.823
Right here?

20:55.857 --> 20:57.158
Okay.

20:57.191 --> 20:58.693
Yes, okay.

20:58.726 --> 21:00.560
It's 20 dollars.

21:00.594 --> 21:01.963
Oh, um.

21:01.996 --> 21:03.597
Here, just take it and go.

21:03.631 --> 21:05.032
What?

21:05.066 --> 21:05.933
You want a hug?

21:08.102 --> 21:08.903
Buddy,

21:10.271 --> 21:12.974
there isn't enough hand
sanitizer in the world.

21:16.244 --> 21:18.478
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.181
Now that I understood.

21:21.249 --> 21:22.817
Next in line.

21:22.850 --> 21:23.784
Say Jim!

21:23.818 --> 21:25.887
That is one bad outfit.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.088
Whoo!

21:27.121 --> 21:29.190
Thank you, I wore
it just for you.

21:29.223 --> 21:30.958
I'm your number one biggest fan.

21:30.992 --> 21:32.093
Well, right back at you,

21:32.126 --> 21:34.028
I think I'm your
number one biggest fan.

21:34.996 --> 21:35.796
What's your name?

21:35.830 --> 21:37.098
Lana.

21:37.131 --> 21:38.398
Just like Lana Turner.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.267
Who?

21:41.235 --> 21:43.137
Never mind, she's someone old,

21:43.170 --> 21:44.338
like me.

21:44.372 --> 21:46.539
No Lana Lang,
like from Supergirl?

21:46.573 --> 21:48.843
Sure, whoever that is.

21:48.876 --> 21:50.344
So I have a confession,

21:50.378 --> 21:53.080
I have posters of you all
over my room at school.

21:53.114 --> 21:54.749
There are no posters of me.

21:54.782 --> 21:56.117
Unless you have one
of my mug shots.

21:56.150 --> 21:58.085
I mean Wolfwood posters.

21:58.119 --> 21:59.452
That makes more sense.

21:59.486 --> 22:03.490
So, how much is
it for an autograph?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.092
It's 20 dollars.

22:07.228 --> 22:09.230
How about a photo with you?

22:09.263 --> 22:12.333
Yeah sorry,
everything's 20 dollars.

22:12.366 --> 22:14.168
I don't have 20 dollars.

22:15.269 --> 22:16.604
Come on, please?

22:16.637 --> 22:19.607
Something to remember you by.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.009
Well how much do you have?

22:22.043 --> 22:23.543
Nothing.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.879
I'm a broke student,

22:24.912 --> 22:25.947
about to graduate.

22:27.815 --> 22:30.483
Then how did you
afford that VIP pass?

22:32.153 --> 22:33.888
Someone gave it
to me for free.

22:35.323 --> 22:37.325
And what did you give him?

22:37.358 --> 22:38.859
It was a him wasn't it?

22:38.893 --> 22:40.227
Maybe.

22:41.662 --> 22:43.898
Please, please please
please please please.

22:43.931 --> 22:46.499
Just something to
remember you by.

22:48.069 --> 22:49.337
I don't know.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.776
Well, maybe we can

22:58.045 --> 22:59.113
I don't know, barter?

23:00.281 --> 23:01.115
Like how?

23:02.350 --> 23:03.384
You know, trade.

23:05.086 --> 23:08.289
I give you an autograph
and take a photo with you.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.826
And what do I
give you in return?

23:14.929 --> 23:16.931
You're a lot of trouble.

23:16.964 --> 23:17.798
Maybe.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.872
It's probably best I
couldn't do it anyway.

23:24.905 --> 23:26.674
Has that ever
happened to you before?

23:27.742 --> 23:28.943
I can't remember,

23:28.976 --> 23:31.345
it's been so long
since I've had sex.

23:31.379 --> 23:32.346
Oh come on,

23:33.447 --> 23:36.583
a sexy, famous,
looking man like you?

23:36.617 --> 23:37.852
At this convention,

23:37.885 --> 23:39.120
I'm famous and sexy.

23:39.153 --> 23:41.889
Back in LA, I'm George Costanza.

23:43.124 --> 23:45.393
You don't have to
be famous to have sex.

23:45.426 --> 23:46.660
No, but it helps.

23:48.195 --> 23:49.596
It helps fill the void, too.

23:51.065 --> 23:53.868
I've filled it with fame, women,

23:55.269 --> 23:57.772
alcohol, weed.

23:59.673 --> 24:00.508
Sounds fun.

24:03.644 --> 24:04.478
Anyway,

24:06.947 --> 24:08.516
meaningless sex just wound up

24:08.548 --> 24:10.418
hurting a lot of people,

24:10.451 --> 24:12.319
especially girls like
you at these conventions.

24:12.353 --> 24:15.256
So one day I decided
I'm only gonna have sex

24:15.289 --> 24:17.291
with people I want
to wake up next to.

24:18.659 --> 24:20.161
That was almost 10 years ago.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.329
I haven't had sex since.

24:23.497 --> 24:24.932
You haven't had
sex in 10 years?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.100
That's insane.

24:27.201 --> 24:28.369
Tell me about it,

24:28.402 --> 24:29.937
I'm wankin' it like
a spider monkey.

24:32.239 --> 24:34.308
But you were ready
to have sex with me.

24:36.811 --> 24:38.479
I know, I'm sorry.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.749
I'm really sorry, Lana.

24:41.782 --> 24:44.652
But this fake fame
has gone to my head.

24:44.685 --> 24:46.720
I thought I came to this
convention for money,

24:46.754 --> 24:50.057
but now I'm thinkin' I
came for the ego boost.

24:51.292 --> 24:52.493
But you are famous.

24:52.526 --> 24:53.593
You have an Emmy.

24:54.428 --> 24:56.197
From 1996.

24:56.230 --> 24:57.798
Trust me, in Hollywood
they give out

24:57.832 --> 24:59.500
those Emmys like
Halloween candy.

25:01.602 --> 25:03.304
Man, I need a Xanax.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.138
I've got some.

25:05.439 --> 25:07.208
How many do you want?

25:09.009 --> 25:10.377
As many as you can spare.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.154
Thanks.

25:29.997 --> 25:30.931
Jeff Nimoy.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.269
Jeff Nimoy's cigarettes.

25:36.904 --> 25:39.473
You know, even though
we didn't like have sex,

25:39.507 --> 25:42.676
this is still like the
greatest day of my life.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.745
I almost made love to Wolfwood.

25:44.778 --> 25:46.680
How many girls can say that?

25:46.714 --> 25:48.249
Only animated girls,

25:48.282 --> 25:51.385
'cause you know, he's fictional.

25:51.418 --> 25:52.253
Duh.

25:53.454 --> 25:56.090
I'm not like some
crazy fan or anything.

25:56.123 --> 25:57.091
I know you're not
really Wolfwood,

25:57.124 --> 25:58.592
but like at the same time,

25:59.593 --> 26:00.427
you are.

26:01.795 --> 26:03.197
My voice is anyway.

26:06.867 --> 26:09.670
I can't believe you
won an Emmy in 1996.

26:10.804 --> 26:11.972
I wasn't even born yet.

26:20.714 --> 26:21.782
How old are you?

26:22.983 --> 26:24.118
18.

26:24.151 --> 26:25.219
What?

26:25.252 --> 26:26.420
I thought you told me

26:26.453 --> 26:27.988
you were about to
graduate from school?

26:28.022 --> 26:30.024
I am, Madison Girls Academy.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.560
High school.

26:32.593 --> 26:33.928
Holy shit!

26:35.496 --> 26:36.530
What's wrong?

26:36.564 --> 26:37.632
I usually have to be wasted

26:37.666 --> 26:39.266
to get into this
kind of trouble.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.368
Thank God I couldn't get it up.

26:41.402 --> 26:42.637
What are you doing?

26:42.671 --> 26:45.272
I'm looking up the age
of consent in Wisconsin.

26:45.306 --> 26:47.007
Oh thank God, it's 18.

26:47.041 --> 26:49.109
Still, you have
to go, right now.

26:49.143 --> 26:51.078
I thought we were
gonna hang out.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.346
No no no no,

26:52.379 --> 26:53.514
we're never going
to hang out again.

26:53.547 --> 26:54.882
Don't you understand?

26:54.915 --> 26:56.483
I'm almost 50.

26:56.517 --> 26:58.519
It was bad enough when
I thought you were 21.

26:58.552 --> 26:59.987
People will think it's creepy.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.890
I'm me and I think it's creepy.

27:02.923 --> 27:04.892
I won't tell
anyone, I promise.

27:04.925 --> 27:07.094
Please, please please please,

27:07.127 --> 27:08.796
if you are my biggest fan,

27:08.829 --> 27:12.433
you'll help me out and forget
this every happened, okay?

27:14.168 --> 27:15.002
Lana!

27:15.803 --> 27:16.570
Okay.

27:16.605 --> 27:17.504
Let's go.

27:17.538 --> 27:18.772
God, you sound like my dad.

27:18.806 --> 27:20.074
Yeah, I'm probably
older than your dad,

27:20.107 --> 27:21.308
so let's go, chop-chop.

27:37.424 --> 27:39.360
So I'd like to thank you all

27:39.393 --> 27:42.062
for coming to my
voice director panel,

27:42.096 --> 27:44.832
and stick around because
in this same room,

27:44.865 --> 27:48.235
if you like voice
actors, and who doesn't?

27:48.269 --> 27:49.970
Except voice directors.

27:51.205 --> 27:52.773
And since I'm a voice
director and a voice actor

27:52.806 --> 27:54.241
I guess I hate myself.

27:56.543 --> 27:58.412
Wow, big crowd.

28:00.014 --> 28:01.515
But if you do
like voice acting,

28:01.548 --> 28:03.384
there is another panel
right after this,

28:03.417 --> 28:04.518
in this very room with

28:05.986 --> 28:09.390
myself, and Lex Lang, the
man of a thousand voices,

28:09.423 --> 28:12.293
and cryin' Brian Donovan.

28:15.562 --> 28:17.831
Nicknamed so because he
makes all the girls cry.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.701
Yeah, daddy.

28:22.002 --> 28:23.037
Hey man, I'm Davis.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.573
And Nikki Boyer.

28:28.142 --> 28:30.745
Who I just met, but I think is

28:30.779 --> 28:33.347
very charming and lovely.

28:35.249 --> 28:36.417
Whooo!

28:37.484 --> 28:38.653
You guys.

28:40.722 --> 28:43.590
So stick around, and
we'll be right back,

28:43.625 --> 28:45.259
thanks again, bye.

28:50.964 --> 28:52.132
You want a second autograph?

28:52.166 --> 28:53.668
No, come on.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.105
Hey hey, gal.

28:58.138 --> 28:58.972
Thank you.

29:00.107 --> 29:00.841
Thank you.

29:00.874 --> 29:01.776
Dude, what are you doing?

29:01.810 --> 29:02.976
What?

29:03.010 --> 29:04.779
It's not fair to charge
some fans and not others.

29:04.813 --> 29:06.347
You can't sign unless you're
at a scheduled session.

29:06.380 --> 29:07.081
Oh right right.

29:07.114 --> 29:09.383
Guys, guys I'm so sorry.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.285
I can't sign now, it's
against con policy.

29:11.318 --> 29:13.487
But, I have an autograph
session tomorrow at six,

29:13.520 --> 29:14.622
please come by then.

29:14.656 --> 29:15.824
I'm so sorry.

29:15.856 --> 29:17.191
I know, I'm sorry, it's
my fault, I'm sorry.

29:17.224 --> 29:18.425
Sorry guys, yeah.

29:18.459 --> 29:20.160
Yeah, I'll see
you tomorrow, okay?

29:20.194 --> 29:21.028
See ya.

29:21.061 --> 29:21.895
Thanks, bye.

29:23.397 --> 29:25.065
You're gonna blow
the whole gig, dude.

29:25.099 --> 29:26.233
Very uncool.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.868
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, it's my fault,

29:27.901 --> 29:30.304
but we never used to charge
for autographs in the old days.

29:30.337 --> 29:32.841
Yeah, well welcome to
the new world, grandpa.

29:32.873 --> 29:34.908
Get it in gear, before you
send us back to the dark ages.

29:34.942 --> 29:37.177
Okay, okay, relax.

29:37.211 --> 29:38.646
Grandpa?

29:38.680 --> 29:40.347
I'm only two years
older than you.

29:40.381 --> 29:41.548
Yeah, whatever.

29:41.582 --> 29:43.283
Ooh, whatever, good comeback.

29:43.317 --> 29:46.153
No wonder they pay you
3000 dollars to be here.

29:47.722 --> 29:49.657
They paid you three thousand.

29:49.691 --> 29:50.491
Yeah, why?

29:50.524 --> 29:51.492
What'd they pay you?

29:52.493 --> 29:53.327
Two.

29:55.496 --> 29:56.930
Ain't that somethin'?

29:56.964 --> 29:59.701
Yeah, I'm gonna go
get us some waters.

29:59.734 --> 30:00.534
Hey you do that.

30:00.567 --> 30:01.902
Yeah.

30:01.935 --> 30:03.270
I like this anime crowd.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.672
I feel tough.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.808
How do I break into
the voiceover industry?

30:06.841 --> 30:09.677
You sorta have to move
to where the work is.

30:09.711 --> 30:12.579
I mean no one's hiring
in Madison, Wisconsin.

30:12.614 --> 30:14.716
So, you have to go where
they're doing the work,

30:14.749 --> 30:16.984
and for me, that means LA.

30:18.485 --> 30:19.953
This is for Nikki Boyer.

30:21.388 --> 30:24.391
Was there anybody you
wanted to be directed by?

30:24.425 --> 30:27.494
Oh that's easy, there's
this guy right over here.

30:28.863 --> 30:31.800
Well Nikki, I'm not really
considered a director.

30:31.833 --> 30:34.301
I wasn't talking about
you, I meant Jeff Nimoy.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.170
Thank you, Brian.

30:36.203 --> 30:37.371
It's not all about you.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.208
Thank you so much,
that's very flattering.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.477
Yeah, I've been
directed by him.

30:43.510 --> 30:44.646
He's not so great.

30:47.247 --> 30:50.017
When I did direct you,
I agree, I wasn't great,

30:50.050 --> 30:52.352
but I'm only as good as
the actors I work with.

30:56.323 --> 30:57.991
Well I'm only as
good as the writing,

30:58.025 --> 31:00.594
and the writing was
so bad on that show.

31:00.628 --> 31:02.429
Who did that show again?

31:02.463 --> 31:04.766
Oh wait, it was you.

31:06.601 --> 31:07.534
You didn't mind
those paychecks

31:07.568 --> 31:08.770
I wrote you though, did you?

31:11.972 --> 31:13.641
This shit just got real.

31:16.711 --> 31:19.413
I don't think I've ever
seen this much testosterone.

31:20.581 --> 31:22.149
You saw that much
when we used to date.

31:22.182 --> 31:23.350
Ooh.

31:25.820 --> 31:27.689
You two dated?

31:27.722 --> 31:29.924
Briefly, on and off, okay?

31:30.859 --> 31:33.193
Believe me, it's still on.

31:33.227 --> 31:36.563
Kiss, kiss, kiss,
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

31:36.597 --> 31:37.932
You guys want me to kiss him?

31:37.966 --> 31:38.933
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

31:38.967 --> 31:39.968
All right.

31:44.538 --> 31:48.475
Ooh.

32:06.393 --> 32:08.061
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

32:08.095 --> 32:09.329
We're gonna mingle
a little bit more,

32:09.363 --> 32:11.064
and we'll see you later.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.165
Can I get a hug?

32:14.334 --> 32:15.135
Sure.

32:17.571 --> 32:18.873
I can die now.

32:18.907 --> 32:21.108
Okay, you do that, bye-bye.

32:27.247 --> 32:28.716
I hate these Meet and Greets.

32:30.384 --> 32:32.219
Why should we have
to work overtime?

32:32.252 --> 32:33.655
Because they pay us good money

32:33.688 --> 32:35.155
to meet like this, one-on-one.

32:35.188 --> 32:37.025
Yeah well, I'm not
seeing any of it.

32:37.057 --> 32:39.661
Yeah you are,
they pay to be here.

32:39.694 --> 32:40.662
Not enough.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.907
I wouldn't get too close
to him if I were you.

32:52.941 --> 32:53.775
To who?

32:54.742 --> 32:56.778
You know, Mister Kissy Face.

32:58.345 --> 32:59.781
Oh my God, are you jealous?

33:01.114 --> 33:02.617
Maybe.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.184
But seriously, I heard he plowed

33:04.217 --> 33:06.520
like a million girls back
in the old days, on tour.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.290
Like you've
never hit on a fan?

33:10.324 --> 33:11.124
A million and one,

33:11.158 --> 33:12.694
but I'm just saying.

33:12.727 --> 33:14.062
Well, maybe he's changed.

33:15.295 --> 33:16.931
Doubtful, I saw him
leaving this afternoon's

33:16.965 --> 33:19.067
autograph session
with a young hottie.

33:19.099 --> 33:21.201
Obviously a little Con nooner.

33:22.269 --> 33:23.671
Don't spread rumors, Brian.

33:23.705 --> 33:24.606
That's not cool.

33:24.639 --> 33:26.173
Fine, ask him yourself.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.541
Fine, I will.

33:29.911 --> 33:31.012
Okay.

33:31.045 --> 33:32.245
Yeah.

33:32.279 --> 33:34.015
I'll be here when you
come crawling back.

33:39.053 --> 33:40.454
Hey, how's it going man?

33:40.487 --> 33:41.656
Well if it isn't Jeff Nimoy.

33:41.689 --> 33:44.157
Oh, how'd you kn...
oh, you cheated.

33:44.191 --> 33:46.094
I swear to God I didn't.

33:46.126 --> 33:47.160
How's it going?

33:47.194 --> 33:48.161
- Good.
- What's your name?

33:48.195 --> 33:48.963
- Brandon.
- Brandon,

33:48.997 --> 33:49.631
okay, how's it going?

33:50.832 --> 33:54.201
Can I get a, oh a club
soda please, thanks.

33:54.234 --> 33:55.435
That's it?

33:55.469 --> 33:56.269
Yeah.

33:56.303 --> 33:57.170
Come on,

33:57.204 --> 33:58.438
Mister Nimoy we've
got a full bar,

33:58.472 --> 33:59.874
you can get anything you'd like.

33:59.907 --> 34:03.176
Oh, oh, okay in that
case I'll have a club soda.

34:04.344 --> 34:05.245
Comin' right up.

34:05.278 --> 34:06.380
Thanks man, I appreciate it.

34:06.413 --> 34:07.314
Hi.

34:07.347 --> 34:08.447
Oh hey, how's it going?

34:08.482 --> 34:09.684
Good.

34:09.717 --> 34:11.719
How about that
panel today, huh?

34:11.753 --> 34:12.552
Yeah.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.487
How about that kiss?

34:15.422 --> 34:16.156
Sorry.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.556
No, don't be.

34:17.591 --> 34:21.228
It was fantastic, the highlight
of that hour, for sure.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.732
Oh, how much do
I owe you buddy?

34:24.766 --> 34:27.601
Oh, nothing for VIP guests,

34:27.635 --> 34:29.704
only the fans and
staff have to pay.

34:29.737 --> 34:30.570
Really?

34:30.605 --> 34:31.505
Yeah.

34:31.538 --> 34:32.572
Can I get you anything?

34:32.607 --> 34:33.373
I'm good.

34:33.407 --> 34:34.574
It's on me.

34:34.609 --> 34:35.842
No, thanks though.

34:35.877 --> 34:36.744
Pretty generous of me.

34:36.777 --> 34:37.577
Yeah, pretty generous.

34:37.612 --> 34:38.445
I'm a giver.

34:40.114 --> 34:41.014
So?

34:41.049 --> 34:43.051
So, can I ask you a question?

34:43.083 --> 34:44.284
Shoot.

34:44.317 --> 34:46.319
What's your stance
on sleeping with fans?

34:49.222 --> 34:50.024
I'm sorry.

34:52.126 --> 34:53.193
Wow, didn't expect that.

34:53.226 --> 34:54.293
Caught you off-guard, huh?

34:54.327 --> 34:57.130
Well, to tell you the truth,

34:57.165 --> 34:59.701
in the old days I
was quite for it.

34:59.734 --> 35:01.169
But now that I'm older,

35:01.201 --> 35:04.605
I don't foresee myself
doing much of it anymore.

35:04.639 --> 35:05.840
Really?

35:05.873 --> 35:07.340
Really.

35:07.374 --> 35:09.443
So what about that girl in
your autograph line today?

35:11.244 --> 35:14.015
That time it really
did come out of my nose.

35:14.048 --> 35:15.582
Are you stalking
me, Nikki Boyer?

35:15.616 --> 35:17.151
Maybe.

35:17.185 --> 35:18.019
Okay.

35:20.088 --> 35:21.055
I thought about it.

35:22.123 --> 35:23.323
I thought about it hard.

35:24.491 --> 35:27.294
But in the end it wasn't
as hard as I thought,

35:28.730 --> 35:29.596
to turn her down.

35:31.065 --> 35:32.432
Good.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.102
Good.

35:34.135 --> 35:35.136
You know, we met before.

35:35.169 --> 35:37.105
Oh, did we?

35:37.138 --> 35:38.639
Did you audition
for me or something?

35:38.673 --> 35:40.675
No, it was actually at a con.

35:40.708 --> 35:42.110
A con?

35:42.143 --> 35:43.644
Yeah, back in Saint Louis,
that's where I'm from.

35:43.678 --> 35:44.979
Oh wow, Saint Louis?

35:45.012 --> 35:46.346
That must have been
a long time ago.

35:46.379 --> 35:49.617
Yeah, gosh it was
like 15 years ago.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.418
Wow, you must have
been like a kid?

35:51.451 --> 35:53.286
Well I was graduated
from college.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.622
And you were already
a voice actress?

35:54.655 --> 35:55.857
No, not yet.

35:55.890 --> 35:57.457
I was attending
the con as a fan.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.527
Wait a minute.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.830
My sleeping with fans,

36:02.864 --> 36:04.132
all this line of questioning,

36:04.165 --> 36:06.701
did we like make
out or something?

36:06.734 --> 36:07.668
No no.

36:07.702 --> 36:08.870
And you're busting me?

36:08.903 --> 36:10.705
- No.
- All these years later.

36:10.738 --> 36:12.640
All right, I'll take
your word for it.

36:13.841 --> 36:16.110
But, I was a big fan of yours.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.345
Still am I guess.

36:19.479 --> 36:20.313
Cheers to that.

36:21.448 --> 36:23.151
Anyway, I remember
that you stayed

36:23.184 --> 36:24.752
way after an autograph
session was over,

36:24.786 --> 36:26.319
to make sure that
each fan got one.

36:26.353 --> 36:29.523
Must have been like five hours?

36:29.556 --> 36:31.692
Huh, I kind of remember that.

36:31.726 --> 36:33.194
And you didn't charge a cent,

36:33.227 --> 36:34.662
it was totally free.

36:36.164 --> 36:38.666
I guess it's different
circumstances for me now.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.501
I'm sorry about that.

36:42.703 --> 36:44.939
Hope you made a lot of money.

36:44.972 --> 36:47.541
I did actually,
like a small fortune.

36:47.574 --> 36:48.810
Well, good for you.

36:48.843 --> 36:50.310
I mean look, it's not
a bad thing to charge,

36:50.343 --> 36:52.345
and I do it sometimes when
the other actors ask me to,

36:52.379 --> 36:53.781
but I usually end up

36:53.815 --> 36:55.850
giving the money to
charity or something.

36:57.185 --> 36:58.953
Well if it makes
you feel any better,

36:58.986 --> 37:00.487
the Jeff Foundation
is taking care

37:00.520 --> 37:02.857
of poor impoverished
voice directors,

37:02.890 --> 37:03.991
and paying their rent.

37:06.493 --> 37:09.063
Can I ask you
another question?

37:09.096 --> 37:11.364
What till I swallow.

37:11.398 --> 37:12.633
All right, go.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.501
Why do you need
the money so bad?

37:14.534 --> 37:15.970
Oh geez.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.238
Don't be shy Nikki Boyer,

37:17.271 --> 37:19.372
ask me a real personal
question next time.

37:21.843 --> 37:22.810
It's a long story.

37:24.145 --> 37:25.746
Maybe after a few
more club sodas

37:25.780 --> 37:27.782
I'll loosen up and tell you.

37:27.815 --> 37:29.349
Okay, that's fair enough.

37:31.484 --> 37:32.887
Want to walk around the con?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.454
Yeah, great idea.

37:34.487 --> 37:35.957
Let's go.

37:35.990 --> 37:38.292
Hey man, for the tip jar.

37:38.326 --> 37:39.126
Oh, thanks.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.628
Thanks buddy.

37:40.661 --> 37:42.096
Easiest drink I'll have
to remember all weekend.

38:10.725 --> 38:13.593
You don't really like
the fans very much, do you?

38:13.628 --> 38:15.329
No, I do, I do.

38:15.363 --> 38:17.430
They just get a little
crazy sometimes,

38:17.464 --> 38:18.866
don't you think?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.868
No not really, I
actually think it's cool,

38:20.902 --> 38:23.037
because they're
usually outsiders,

38:23.070 --> 38:24.272
and they feel like
they don't fit in,

38:24.305 --> 38:25.773
and I'm sure some of
them are even bullied,

38:25.806 --> 38:28.276
or made fun of for
liking cosplay so much,

38:28.309 --> 38:31.312
but here it's not like that.

38:31.345 --> 38:32.980
I never thought
of it that way.

38:33.014 --> 38:34.015
Yeah, you're right.

38:34.048 --> 38:37.084
This place is pretty nice.

38:37.118 --> 38:39.053
I haven't been this
relaxed in forever.

38:40.254 --> 38:41.454
Relaxed is good.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.491
Stress will kill you.

38:44.524 --> 38:45.359
Oh yeah.

38:47.228 --> 38:49.562
I've also been a little
depressed lately.

38:49.596 --> 38:51.098
Well that's not good.

38:51.132 --> 38:53.566
No, it's like
very not good, okay?

38:53.601 --> 38:54.835
Believe me.

38:54.869 --> 38:56.637
Take the opposite of good, okay.

38:56.671 --> 38:57.872
What's the opposite of good?

38:57.905 --> 38:59.240
Not good, that's the
opposite of good.

38:59.273 --> 39:00.573
But that's good.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.244
I thought we'd do
the greatest tremendous

39:03.277 --> 39:05.913
most tremendous impersonations
of all time, okay?

39:05.947 --> 39:07.949
Probably the greatest
impersonator ever.

39:10.117 --> 39:11.152
Who else do you do?

39:12.119 --> 39:14.221
I do Herve Villechaize.

39:14.255 --> 39:15.156
Hello boss.

39:16.390 --> 39:17.758
I don't know who that is.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.460
Da plane, da plane!

39:20.493 --> 39:21.295
No.

39:21.329 --> 39:22.363
Fantasy Island.

39:22.396 --> 39:24.131
I think it's before my time.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.336
How dare you?

39:28.369 --> 39:29.469
How dare you?

39:30.604 --> 39:32.740
See, how can you stay
depressed around me?

39:33.808 --> 39:34.709
I guess I can't.

39:36.077 --> 39:37.611
I mean, how depressed are you?

39:39.947 --> 39:41.649
Not as depressed as
this guy, obviously.

39:44.085 --> 39:45.019
That's him.

39:46.187 --> 39:47.321
Depressed, depressed.

39:47.355 --> 39:48.656
Like suicidal?

39:48.689 --> 39:50.257
- No!
- That's good.

39:50.291 --> 39:51.392
Not today.

39:51.425 --> 39:52.827
Jeff?

39:52.860 --> 39:55.196
Well if I did die, no one's
life would be different.

39:56.797 --> 39:58.833
People would be sad.

39:58.866 --> 39:59.834
I would be sad.

40:01.002 --> 40:03.037
Yeah, you'll all be
sad for a little while.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.473
You know this guy'll be
sad for a minute or two.

40:05.505 --> 40:07.775
But no one's life will
physically change.

40:07.808 --> 40:09.777
I have no wife, no kids.

40:09.810 --> 40:11.145
It would be like
I was never here.

40:11.178 --> 40:12.013
Poof.

40:14.048 --> 40:15.850
There'd be no Digimon.

40:15.883 --> 40:17.385
Of course there would.

40:17.418 --> 40:19.220
I didn't create the show,
I was just a hired monkey.

40:19.253 --> 40:21.355
It's a fluke I even
worked in anime at all.

40:21.389 --> 40:23.556
I couldn't get
arrested as an actor.

40:23.590 --> 40:27.261
Then I booked a cheap little
VO job in anime one day,

40:27.294 --> 40:30.831
and then worked it into
writing and directing,

40:30.865 --> 40:34.635
then I got Digimon, and I've
been stuck in anime ever since.

40:34.668 --> 40:37.905
It's not a bad
place to be stuck.

40:37.938 --> 40:38.773
If you say so.

40:40.074 --> 40:41.342
Wow, you are depressed.

40:42.777 --> 40:43.611
I'll be okay.

40:45.246 --> 40:47.148
As long as you're here.

40:48.015 --> 40:49.183
But as soon as you leave,

40:49.216 --> 40:50.718
I'll be depressed again.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.889
Well I guess I'd
better not leave then.

40:57.557 --> 40:59.794
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

41:03.030 --> 41:04.632
It's getting late.

41:04.665 --> 41:05.565
Let's get going.

41:08.536 --> 41:09.970
Later than I think.

41:10.004 --> 41:10.805
Oh!

41:13.741 --> 41:14.542
Hate you.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.080
Meanwhile, at the
hall of justice.

41:24.418 --> 41:27.388
Well, this is me.

41:27.421 --> 41:28.622
Okay.

41:28.656 --> 41:30.091
Thanks for today.

41:30.124 --> 41:33.027
I had a really good time.

41:33.961 --> 41:34.795
Me too.

41:36.230 --> 41:38.199
Wanna come in for a nightcap?

41:38.232 --> 41:39.700
I thought you didn't drink?

41:40.935 --> 41:42.470
All right, you busted me.

41:43.471 --> 41:45.506
You did promise not to leave me.

41:45.539 --> 41:48.642
Oh promise is kind
of a strong word.

41:50.744 --> 41:53.013
I just don't want
the night to end.

41:53.047 --> 41:56.317
Are you sure your depression
can handle more fun?

41:56.350 --> 42:01.355
I can handle more of that
kiss you gave me today.

42:08.229 --> 42:10.364
Maybe I'll come to
your room tomorrow.

42:14.201 --> 42:15.202
Tomorrow, huh?

42:15.236 --> 42:15.970
Yeah.

42:18.272 --> 42:20.908
But I never said anything
about my room tonight.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.046
Okay.

43:28.075 --> 43:29.410
Yes!

43:29.443 --> 43:30.377
Yes!

43:39.587 --> 43:40.821
You can get some shrimp?

43:40.854 --> 43:43.190
Yes, I can get some shrimp.

43:45.259 --> 43:47.094
Okay well.

43:47.127 --> 43:48.495
He must really
want some shrimp.

43:48.529 --> 43:50.164
Voice actors love shrimp.

43:50.197 --> 43:53.200
I think they, maybe they
expect that on the set.

43:53.234 --> 43:54.068
All the time.

43:57.371 --> 44:00.107
Well look what the cat
from Trigun dragged in.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.175
Hello Kitty.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.576
Good morning.

44:02.611 --> 44:04.812
You look well rested.

44:04.845 --> 44:06.413
Thank you.

44:06.447 --> 44:07.682
Sleep well?

44:07.716 --> 44:08.617
Reasonably.

44:08.650 --> 44:10.017
You?

44:10.050 --> 44:10.951
Very well, thanks.

44:10.985 --> 44:12.253
Although I didn't have anyone

44:12.286 --> 44:14.021
to keep me warm last
night like you did.

44:14.054 --> 44:15.856
Are you stalking me, Brian?

44:15.889 --> 44:17.791
No, but I can tell
by your reaction

44:17.825 --> 44:20.527
that you were with
Nimoy last night, ha.

44:20.561 --> 44:22.329
Ha ha, not funny.

44:22.363 --> 44:23.797
No, not ha ha funny,

44:23.831 --> 44:25.966
ha ha the joke's on you.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.401
Don't say I didn't warn you.

44:28.435 --> 44:30.004
Good morning, all.

44:30.037 --> 44:30.938
Hi.

44:30.971 --> 44:31.805
Good morning.

44:31.839 --> 44:32.973
What's up?

44:33.007 --> 44:34.241
Hey, try the
sausages, Nikki did.

44:34.275 --> 44:35.242
This little one's
the perfect size.

44:35.276 --> 44:36.310
You're so juvenile.

44:37.211 --> 44:38.112
What was that all about?

44:38.145 --> 44:39.146
It's not worth it.

44:40.615 --> 44:42.082
Neither is this breakfast.

44:42.116 --> 44:44.551
Plus I don't see any food
handlers wearing gloves.

44:44.585 --> 44:46.053
I have a better idea.

44:46.086 --> 44:48.289
Why don't I buy you breakfast
downstairs with my per diem?

44:48.322 --> 44:48.989
Yes, indeed-em.

44:49.023 --> 44:50.224
All right, it's nice to have

44:50.257 --> 44:51.760
some money in my
pocket for once.

44:55.996 --> 44:57.398
You were too perfect.

45:07.642 --> 45:10.911
I will have a waffle, and
a side of sausage please.

45:10.944 --> 45:12.781
Great, could I
get you guys started

45:12.813 --> 45:14.882
with some mimosas
or bloody mary's?

45:14.915 --> 45:16.950
Ooh, I'll actually
have a bloody Mary,

45:16.984 --> 45:17.885
extra spicy please.

45:17.918 --> 45:19.520
Excellent, and you sir?

45:19.553 --> 45:21.055
I'm good with
just coffee, thanks.

45:21.088 --> 45:22.222
I'll be right back.

45:22.256 --> 45:24.158
So, tell me
about this new job.

45:24.191 --> 45:26.527
Oh, so it's an
interview for a producer

45:26.560 --> 45:30.197
of like "Best Beach Paradises,"
or some crap like that.

45:30.230 --> 45:31.031
That's great.

45:31.065 --> 45:32.667
So you love the beach.

45:32.701 --> 45:35.869
Yeah, yeah, but more importantly
it's a job in reality TV,

45:35.903 --> 45:38.038
and if I can build
my reality TV resume,

45:38.072 --> 45:39.808
I can hit up my
bigshot brother-in-law

45:39.840 --> 45:42.276
the reality TV
producer, for a gig.

45:42.309 --> 45:43.745
- Great!
- Yeah.

45:43.778 --> 45:45.012
Well, fingers crossed.

45:45.045 --> 45:46.280
Thank you.

45:46.313 --> 45:47.548
Here you go.

45:47.581 --> 45:48.415
Thank you.

45:50.217 --> 45:53.320
All right, to you
getting this job.

45:53.354 --> 45:54.188
Thank you.

45:57.324 --> 45:58.325
God, I need this job too,

45:58.359 --> 46:00.527
I haven't worked in forever.

46:00.561 --> 46:03.497
Why don't you just
go back to anime?

46:04.666 --> 46:05.599
It's complicated.

46:08.670 --> 46:10.337
You don't drink
at all, do you?

46:11.305 --> 46:13.340
Well, I used to,

46:13.374 --> 46:14.609
a little too much.

46:14.642 --> 46:16.977
Oh, is that a problem?

46:17.010 --> 46:17.846
It became one.

46:19.614 --> 46:20.948
The slightest little
emotional setback,

46:20.981 --> 46:22.751
and I reached for
the Jack Daniels.

46:22.784 --> 46:24.952
Hurricane Jeff would come
blowin' through town,

46:24.985 --> 46:26.688
destroying everything
in its wake.

46:27.588 --> 46:29.056
So when did it get bad?

46:29.089 --> 46:31.125
Oh yeah well,

46:31.158 --> 46:32.259
there was an incident.

46:36.263 --> 46:39.701
One drunken night I broke
into this recording studio,

46:39.734 --> 46:40.835
that was underpaying me.

46:40.869 --> 46:41.770
Uh oh.

46:41.803 --> 46:43.470
I had the
keys, I let myself in,

46:43.504 --> 46:45.807
but I started throwing
things around,

46:45.840 --> 46:47.241
messing with all the levels,

46:48.409 --> 46:51.011
but then I went a little
too far, even for me.

46:51.044 --> 46:53.013
Okay, what did you do?

46:53.046 --> 46:55.249
I took a dump
on the control panel.

46:56.917 --> 46:58.986
- No.
- Yes.

46:59.019 --> 46:59.821
You didn't?

46:59.854 --> 47:00.655
I did.

47:00.688 --> 47:01.522
That is so gross.

47:02.556 --> 47:04.391
I know, I know.

47:04.425 --> 47:06.059
It was terrible.

47:06.093 --> 47:08.095
I was fired the next day.

47:08.128 --> 47:10.264
The day after that,
I quit drinking.

47:11.131 --> 47:12.332
Smart.

47:12.366 --> 47:13.534
Not smart enough.

47:13.567 --> 47:16.403
I couldn't get arrested
in anime after that.

47:16.437 --> 47:19.306
That's the complicated
part I told you about.

47:19.339 --> 47:20.140
Is it that?

47:20.174 --> 47:21.676
That's real complicated.

47:21.709 --> 47:23.010
But I don't understand.

47:23.043 --> 47:26.447
How did they know it
was you that, you know,

47:27.615 --> 47:29.684
left the doodie
on the soundboard?

47:29.717 --> 47:31.218
Yeah.

47:31.251 --> 47:34.021
In a way I sort of confessed.

47:34.054 --> 47:34.889
How?

47:35.890 --> 47:36.825
I signed my name.

47:39.326 --> 47:40.327
With the doodie.

47:41.562 --> 47:44.264
Here is
your food, pardon me.

47:51.004 --> 47:52.740
I kind of lost my appetite,

47:52.774 --> 47:54.308
everything looks
like a turd now.

47:59.012 --> 48:00.514
You're so funny.

48:05.452 --> 48:06.286
Oh my God.

48:08.155 --> 48:09.523
Leonard Nimoy!

48:09.556 --> 48:11.693
Well, if you have no appetite

48:11.726 --> 48:15.395
then how about we
go back upstairs?

48:15.429 --> 48:17.097
And work up an appetite maybe.

48:17.130 --> 48:19.199
Okay, I like that idea.

48:19.233 --> 48:20.234
Okay, let's go.

48:21.502 --> 48:22.536
All right.

48:30.410 --> 48:31.478
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

48:31.512 --> 48:33.648
Hey, no no no, I know a
shortcut, I know a shortcut.

48:33.681 --> 48:34.949
Go this way, yeah, yeah.

48:56.671 --> 48:57.872
Thank you for the question.

48:57.906 --> 48:59.774
I really loved doing Word Girl,

48:59.807 --> 49:01.208
but I have to say,

49:02.509 --> 49:03.343
thank you,

49:04.244 --> 49:05.713
but I have to say
my all-time favorite

49:05.747 --> 49:07.982
was probably Captain Infinity.

49:08.917 --> 49:09.918
Any other questions?

49:12.620 --> 49:13.587
Yeah excuse me.

49:13.621 --> 49:15.589
Hi Miss Boyer, I
have a question.

49:15.623 --> 49:18.492
In Naruto, do you think
your character Shika-Shika

49:18.525 --> 49:21.528
had a little crush on
my character, Rock Lee?

49:23.463 --> 49:24.866
Really?

49:24.899 --> 49:27.602
No actually, I think she
hated him, and I can see why.

49:29.938 --> 49:30.805
Next question?

49:30.838 --> 49:32.239
No no no, what about
when my character

49:32.272 --> 49:33.708
saved your character's life?

49:33.741 --> 49:36.476
Do you think she regrets that
they never became lovers?

49:38.780 --> 49:41.181
Actually in the backstory
that I created for my character,

49:41.214 --> 49:42.416
they did become lovers,

49:42.449 --> 49:45.285
but in the end, she
dumped his sorry ass.

49:49.624 --> 49:51.659
Okay, final question?

49:51.693 --> 49:53.928
What does Brian
Donovan look like naked?

49:56.764 --> 49:59.333
Well, it's like
a bad anime series.

49:59.366 --> 50:00.567
It looks all slick,

50:00.602 --> 50:04.338
but the story line is
really hard to find.

50:09.644 --> 50:11.012
All right you guys,
thank you so much.

50:11.045 --> 50:12.512
I loved this, I look forward

50:12.546 --> 50:14.749
to seeing you at six p.m. at
my autograph session tonight.

50:14.782 --> 50:15.850
Okay?

50:27.061 --> 50:27.996
Nik?

50:28.029 --> 50:29.964
Hey Nik, come on wait up.

50:29.998 --> 50:30.798
Nik, come on.

50:30.832 --> 50:32.232
Nik, wait.

50:32.265 --> 50:35.369
What, you totally
hijacked my panel, Brian.

50:35.402 --> 50:36.503
Look, I'm sorry.

50:36.536 --> 50:37.972
No, you're not sorry,

50:38.006 --> 50:39.941
you just want to punish me
for being with somebody else.

50:40.942 --> 50:43.611
No, no I want you back.

50:45.079 --> 50:47.414
Brian that is so messed up.

50:47.447 --> 50:50.317
Listen, I've been thinking,
we ended prematurely.

50:50.350 --> 50:51.819
We never gave it a real shot.

50:52.854 --> 50:54.122
But seeing you at the con,

50:55.555 --> 50:57.424
makes me realize you're
the one that got away, Nik.

50:59.593 --> 51:00.394
Brian.

51:01.461 --> 51:02.262
Come on.

51:03.430 --> 51:05.165
You know you still
have feelings for me.

51:06.266 --> 51:08.870
I, I don't.

51:10.104 --> 51:12.172
I've been hanging out
with Jeff all weekend.

51:13.173 --> 51:14.307
Oh, fuck Jeff Nimoy.

51:20.882 --> 51:21.983
You fucked Jeff Nimoy.

51:23.216 --> 51:24.052
Brian.

51:25.887 --> 51:27.088
I figured you
guys fooled around,

51:27.121 --> 51:28.022
but I thought.

51:30.457 --> 51:32.093
I don't want to
hurt you, okay?

51:34.729 --> 51:36.698
Why should I be
surprised, Nik?

51:36.731 --> 51:38.900
You slept with me
on the first date.

51:38.933 --> 51:40.400
How dare you.

51:40.434 --> 51:43.537
Yeah well, I'm an idiot
to think I was special.

51:44.706 --> 51:45.807
That's not fair.

51:47.474 --> 51:48.341
I just...

51:48.375 --> 51:49.276
It's just what?

51:52.113 --> 51:54.414
I think I might be
falling in love with him.

51:56.150 --> 51:59.486
Again, I don't why
I should be surprised.

51:59.519 --> 52:01.488
You told me you loved me
on our second date, Nik.

52:03.124 --> 52:06.761
Brian, don't do this.

52:06.794 --> 52:08.295
I thought we were friends now.

52:08.328 --> 52:09.130
Oh, God.

52:17.972 --> 52:19.239
There you go.

52:21.876 --> 52:23.211
Hey I'm a huge fan.

52:23.243 --> 52:24.779
Could you relay this.

52:24.812 --> 52:25.713
Sure.

52:25.747 --> 52:26.981
Hi, I thought Jeff Nimoy

52:27.014 --> 52:28.582
was supposed to sign
at this time today?

52:28.616 --> 52:29.984
No, that was yesterday.

52:30.017 --> 52:32.120
Today he signs with
Nikki Boyer at six.

52:32.153 --> 52:32.987
Shoot.

52:35.022 --> 52:36.456
Do have something
you want me to sign?

52:36.490 --> 52:38.993
Oh sure.

52:39.026 --> 52:40.527
I mean what shall I do?

52:43.765 --> 52:45.199
Okay.

52:45.233 --> 52:46.768
So you really like Jeff, huh?

52:48.069 --> 52:48.936
I mean yeah.

52:48.970 --> 52:50.838
Your favorite actor?

52:50.872 --> 52:52.305
Wolfwood is like
my all-time crush,

52:52.339 --> 52:53.540
but Jeff is just like.

52:56.343 --> 52:58.012
We're really close friends like,

52:58.045 --> 53:00.047
more than friends really.

53:00.081 --> 53:00.882
Really?

53:00.915 --> 53:02.083
Yes.

53:02.116 --> 53:03.885
'Cause that's not
what he told me.

53:03.918 --> 53:05.385
What?

53:05.418 --> 53:07.255
No, he just said you
were his new Madison pump.

53:07.287 --> 53:10.024
He's got a fangirl
in almost every city.

53:10.057 --> 53:11.291
No, he doesn't sleep around,

53:11.324 --> 53:13.661
he literally told
me he never has sex.

53:13.694 --> 53:14.629
Oh no?

53:14.662 --> 53:15.863
Yeah, he never has sex.

53:15.897 --> 53:16.831
Why don't you ask him,

53:16.864 --> 53:18.032
why don't you text
him right now?

53:18.065 --> 53:19.000
I don't have his number.

53:19.033 --> 53:19.934
He's sleeping with you,

53:19.967 --> 53:21.002
but he doesn't give
you his number?

53:21.035 --> 53:22.103
What does that tell you?

53:22.136 --> 53:23.271
Okay, give me your phone.

53:23.303 --> 53:25.873
I'll put his number in for you.

53:29.110 --> 53:30.611
Never has sex.

53:30.645 --> 53:32.379
Tell that to Nikki Boyer.

53:32.412 --> 53:34.347
They've been bumpin'
bellies since they got here.

53:34.381 --> 53:35.683
No, I don't believe you.

53:37.251 --> 53:38.820
They're probably doing
the hokey-pokey right now.

53:38.853 --> 53:39.654
What time is it?

53:40.822 --> 53:42.657
Time for his five
o'clock feeding.

53:42.690 --> 53:44.058
They're doing it, all right.

53:49.496 --> 53:50.530
Hey wait,

53:50.564 --> 53:51.699
wait your phone!

53:54.769 --> 53:57.537
I can't believe I was able
to do it twice in one day.

53:58.572 --> 53:59.674
You're not that old.

54:01.108 --> 54:03.644
No, but twice is a rare
occasion for me indeed.

54:03.678 --> 54:06.113
Well, I'm here to tell
you from experience,

54:06.147 --> 54:08.216
you can still do it
twice in one day.

54:10.985 --> 54:11.819
Thanks.

54:13.788 --> 54:15.589
It's not just age, I told you.

54:15.623 --> 54:18.226
I've been stressed
out of my mind lately.

54:18.259 --> 54:19.593
I even started smoking again.

54:19.627 --> 54:21.996
Oh no, uh-uh.

54:22.029 --> 54:23.363
That's a big no.

54:23.396 --> 54:24.799
'Cause I can't be with a smoker

54:24.832 --> 54:26.200
so that has to stop.

54:27.335 --> 54:29.270
I only smoke
when I'm stressed.

54:29.303 --> 54:30.771
Take a Xanax, or something.

54:33.506 --> 54:34.308
You want one?

54:39.347 --> 54:40.181
No.

54:42.250 --> 54:44.384
I'm not as stressed
when I'm with you.

54:46.220 --> 54:47.788
You're like the best Xanax ever.

54:49.522 --> 54:51.025
I'm thinking about

54:51.058 --> 54:53.460
bottling you and selling you
to a pharmaceutical company.

54:56.731 --> 54:58.299
Don't be stressed out
about your interview,

54:58.332 --> 54:59.333
you're gonna get it.

55:00.768 --> 55:03.570
I don't recommend going
broke in your late 40's.

55:05.172 --> 55:08.142
Hey, maybe you
can't work in anime,

55:08.175 --> 55:11.312
but they still love
you at the conventions.

55:12.246 --> 55:13.147
Okay, so?

55:14.348 --> 55:17.752
So, like you can make
thousands in a weekend.

55:17.785 --> 55:20.888
Yeah, but all I need to
do is get invited first.

55:20.922 --> 55:23.090
This is my first con
invite in 10 years.

55:23.124 --> 55:25.059
They don't know
you're interested yet.

55:26.593 --> 55:27.895
I don't know.

55:27.929 --> 55:29.130
What's there to know?

55:29.163 --> 55:30.831
This is a job, and
you need a job.

55:32.266 --> 55:33.100
Yeah but,

55:34.268 --> 55:36.771
I didn't move to LA to
be some Z-list celebrity

55:36.804 --> 55:37.972
at anime conventions.

55:38.839 --> 55:40.241
I didn't mean it like that.

55:40.274 --> 55:41.742
It's just that

55:41.776 --> 55:46.380
I came out to make real
movies and real TV shows.

55:47.547 --> 55:49.283
Anime shows are real
movies and real TV.

55:51.319 --> 55:54.021
Yeah, but no,

55:54.055 --> 55:54.889
not to me.

55:55.756 --> 55:57.124
I can't explain it,

55:57.158 --> 56:01.696
I just, if I did this full-time
I'd feel like a failure.

56:01.729 --> 56:03.731
That's ridiculous.

56:03.764 --> 56:04.832
Do you consider me a failure?

56:04.865 --> 56:06.000
No.

56:06.033 --> 56:07.068
So neither are you.

56:08.235 --> 56:11.238
So come travel with me.

56:11.272 --> 56:12.472
Come on.

56:12.505 --> 56:13.407
We're doing this
huge Digimon tour,

56:13.441 --> 56:15.142
and I voice one of the leads.

56:15.176 --> 56:16.243
I'm not in it.

56:16.277 --> 56:17.477
So what? Who cares?

56:17.510 --> 56:20.348
You're Mister Digimon,
they'd love to have you.

56:21.849 --> 56:22.917
You think?

56:22.950 --> 56:24.051
Absolutely.

56:25.518 --> 56:26.654
Think about it,

56:26.687 --> 56:27.822
going on tour together.

56:29.023 --> 56:30.858
It'll be so much fun together.

56:30.891 --> 56:31.692
Yeah?

56:31.726 --> 56:32.626
Yeah.

56:32.660 --> 56:33.427
- Like this?
- Yeah.

56:33.461 --> 56:34.662
Just like this?

56:34.695 --> 56:37.098
Forget Xanax, you're
more like Viagra.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.235
Uh-oh, here comes another plane.

56:42.203 --> 56:42.970
That's my phone.

56:43.004 --> 56:43.938
Ignore it.

56:44.839 --> 56:46.506
They keep texting.

56:48.142 --> 56:49.677
They're just gonna
keep on calling.

56:49.710 --> 56:52.279
Let them call 9-1-1
if it's an emergency.

56:58.019 --> 56:59.286
It's important.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.588
Could I be frustrated
after twice already?

57:02.857 --> 57:04.591
What is this?

57:04.625 --> 57:06.127
What is it?

57:06.160 --> 57:08.696
I think you should know I'm
also sleeping with Jeff Nimoy.

57:08.729 --> 57:09.562
What?

57:10.898 --> 57:12.033
You jerk!

57:12.066 --> 57:14.402
Whoa take it
easy, who sent this?

57:14.435 --> 57:16.437
Oh, there's so many
you can't keep track?

57:16.470 --> 57:19.240
Oh my God, that's
not what I mean.

57:19.273 --> 57:20.641
Brian warned me of this,

57:20.674 --> 57:23.110
he said that you had a
different girl in every city.

57:23.144 --> 57:25.012
That is absolutely not true.

57:25.046 --> 57:26.213
Why did he say it?

57:26.247 --> 57:27.748
Oh fuck Brian
Donovan, who knows?

57:27.782 --> 57:29.116
He's probably jealous of me.

57:29.150 --> 57:31.551
In the old days, when we
were on tour together,

57:33.020 --> 57:34.989
I was a little
rambunctious with the fans.

57:35.022 --> 57:36.556
But that was a long time ago.

57:36.589 --> 57:38.793
I haven't been like
that for years.

57:38.826 --> 57:39.827
Who is this girl?

57:39.860 --> 57:41.095
I don't know.

57:41.929 --> 57:43.697
She the girl that you
took up to your room

57:43.731 --> 57:44.932
for a nooner on Friday?

57:44.965 --> 57:46.100
What?

57:46.133 --> 57:47.535
What?

57:47.567 --> 57:49.569
Yeah, is she?

57:50.471 --> 57:51.906
Don't lie to me Jeff.

57:51.939 --> 57:53.774
I asked you about this last
night in the Green Room,

57:53.808 --> 57:55.042
and you said that
it wasn't true.

57:55.076 --> 57:56.744
I will swear on
a stack of Bibles,

57:56.777 --> 57:58.913
I did not have sex
with that girl.

58:00.815 --> 58:02.316
Did you bring her upstairs.?

58:04.251 --> 58:06.787
Yes but, but, but, but...

58:08.355 --> 58:09.824
Jeff, be serious.

58:09.857 --> 58:12.460
But, but, I told you.

58:12.493 --> 58:14.728
I thought about it, I
thought about it hard,

58:14.762 --> 58:16.764
but I could not go
through with it.

58:16.797 --> 58:20.501
And, and, I barely even
knew you at that point.

58:20.534 --> 58:22.736
It's not about the timeline,

58:22.770 --> 58:24.472
it's about the fact
that you lied to me.

58:24.505 --> 58:25.739
A, I didn't lie to you,

58:25.773 --> 58:27.274
and B, it is about the timeline,

58:27.308 --> 58:29.009
because I didn't
even fall in love

58:29.043 --> 58:30.411
with you until last night!

58:33.781 --> 58:35.616
Did I just say that out loud?

58:37.418 --> 58:38.252
Shit.

58:40.754 --> 58:42.089
You fell in love with me?

58:43.524 --> 58:44.725
I think I love you,

58:44.758 --> 58:45.960
but I didn't want
to say out loud

58:45.993 --> 58:47.528
because I knew it
would scare you away,

58:47.561 --> 58:48.963
'cause it's so soon.

58:54.802 --> 58:57.571
That was just during breakfast.

58:57.606 --> 58:58.873
Oh hey guys.

58:58.906 --> 59:00.241
Hi.

59:00.274 --> 59:02.409
You look really
cute in that T-shirt.

59:02.443 --> 59:03.277
Ah.

59:04.879 --> 59:07.281
So you were with her
after you were with me?

59:07.314 --> 59:08.082
What?

59:08.115 --> 59:09.016
Mm-hmm.

59:09.049 --> 59:10.217
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

59:10.251 --> 59:11.485
Please tell me this
is not happening.

59:11.519 --> 59:12.820
I was in love with you!

59:12.853 --> 59:14.588
You said "I love
you" to her too?

59:14.623 --> 59:16.056
Of course not,
she's just a kid.

59:16.090 --> 59:17.725
A kid you took to bed.

59:17.758 --> 59:19.593
Hey Jeff, please tell me,

59:19.628 --> 59:20.728
please tell me,

59:20.761 --> 59:22.029
because I'm starting to think
that you're a sociopath.

59:22.062 --> 59:22.997
Did you?

59:23.030 --> 59:24.498
No, not the way
she's saying it.

59:24.532 --> 59:25.666
This feels like another
timeline issue, because...

59:25.699 --> 59:26.934
I'm such an idiot.

59:26.967 --> 59:28.135
I'm an idiot.

59:28.169 --> 59:29.638
You're gonna fall in
love in a split second,

59:29.670 --> 59:30.971
and then a split second
later, I'm getting burned.

59:31.005 --> 59:32.439
I'm not burning you.

59:32.473 --> 59:34.441
I'm the one who's getting
burned, I had him first!

59:34.475 --> 59:35.276
What did I expect?

59:35.309 --> 59:36.510
I don't even know you.

59:36.544 --> 59:38.145
You know me better
than anyone right now.

59:38.179 --> 59:40.181
I asked you an hour ago
if you slept with her,

59:40.214 --> 59:41.415
and you said no!

59:41.448 --> 59:42.651
I didn't.

59:42.683 --> 59:45.386
Only because he
couldn't get it up.

59:45.419 --> 59:46.487
You're not helping!

59:48.522 --> 59:50.324
No don't, you're a jerk.

59:50.357 --> 59:53.327
Nikki, Nikki
please, I can explain.

59:53.360 --> 59:55.563
Oh yeah, explain it to me.

59:55.596 --> 59:57.364
Lex, what the heck, man?

59:57.398 --> 59:59.333
Daddy, I have
this under control.

59:59.366 --> 01:00:00.267
Daddy!

01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:01.969
Yeah, I'm her father, Jeff.

01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:04.171
God, I wish you
hadn't done this.

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:05.739
Because now I'm gonna
have to hurt you.

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:07.875
Whoa, whoa, how is
she your daughter?

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.710
Because I banged her
mother, that's how.

01:00:09.743 --> 01:00:11.912
I told you I had
family in Madison.

01:00:11.946 --> 01:00:14.515
Your real name is Lana Lang?

01:00:14.548 --> 01:00:15.749
Yeah, I told you that.

01:00:15.783 --> 01:00:18.018
You told me you were
cosplaying as her.

01:00:18.052 --> 01:00:19.386
Yeah, but it's
also my real name.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.255
Yeah, a name that you soiled.

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:23.290
Daddy, I never
should have told you.

01:00:23.324 --> 01:00:24.592
What did you tell your daddy?

01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:25.826
She tells me everything.

01:00:25.859 --> 01:00:27.728
She said you tried
to seduce her.

01:00:28.762 --> 01:00:30.097
How is that even possible?

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.099
Oh, like it was that hard?

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:33.934
Now you're saying
my daughter's easy?

01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:35.369
No Lex, but I mean, come on,

01:00:35.402 --> 01:00:36.470
look at the way she's dressed.

01:00:36.503 --> 01:00:37.905
She's till a teenager.

01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:39.506
Which I found out
afterwards by the way,

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.775
and technically 18
is legal, I checked.

01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:44.545
Who do you think
you are, Kevin Spacey?

01:00:44.578 --> 01:00:46.113
Nothing happened.

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.982
Kevin Spacey?

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:49.917
Look, we made out a little bit,

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.721
and maybe I went to second
base, outside the costume,

01:00:52.753 --> 01:00:54.288
and maybe I felt a
little something here.

01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.323
So early detection,
that's a plus.

01:00:56.357 --> 01:00:59.293
I'm gonna start by
breaking your fingers.

01:00:59.326 --> 01:01:00.695
And if that doesn't
hit the spot,

01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:02.664
then I'm gonna go for
the painful stuff.

01:01:02.697 --> 01:01:05.399
Pliers, ice picks, whatever
I can find laying around.

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:06.601
Daddy, please don't hurt him.

01:01:06.635 --> 01:01:08.135
Yes Daddy, please
don't hurt me.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:10.271
Don't you call me Daddy,
you're older than I am.

01:01:10.304 --> 01:01:11.606
And therefore
much more fragile,

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.040
so take it easy Lex,

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:15.376
you're a mediation
teacher for Buddha's sake!

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.844
Daddy please, I love him.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:18.713
Shut up!

01:01:18.747 --> 01:01:20.948
Don't you tell my
daughter to shut up!

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:31.058
Hello,

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:34.895
hello, hello, hello,
hello, goodbye.

01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:03.692
Hey have you seen
anybody come through here?

01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:05.326
Will you sign my badge?

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:06.160
Sure man.

01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:11.198
So?

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.466
That way.

01:02:12.499 --> 01:02:13.567
Thanks man.

01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:23.712
Thanks kid.

01:02:23.745 --> 01:02:25.245
Considering that I
got rid of Lex for you,

01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:26.580
mind signing my cross?

01:02:27.548 --> 01:02:28.382
You know what?

01:02:29.283 --> 01:02:30.685
I got a better deal for you.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:45.366
Cosplaying as myself.

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:46.900
I am a pathetic loser.

01:02:55.777 --> 01:02:57.612
Hey, nice Wolfwood cosplay.

01:02:57.645 --> 01:02:58.979
Thanks, Needle Noggins.

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:03.384
He even sounded like Wolfwood.

01:03:25.372 --> 01:03:26.507
Hi guys.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.374
If,

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:30.678
if you're here for the
voice acting workshop,

01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:32.179
you're in the right place.

01:03:32.212 --> 01:03:34.581
Why did you
come as Wolfwood?

01:03:36.718 --> 01:03:40.053
Yeah, sometimes you just
want to be unrecognizable.

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:42.757
Anyway.

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.728
Tammy, tammy tammy tammy.

01:03:46.761 --> 01:03:49.396
Jeff Nimoy is
cosplaying as Wolfwood.

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:50.799
You've got to come with me.

01:03:50.832 --> 01:03:52.966
Oh man, I have
got to see this.

01:03:57.639 --> 01:03:59.173
So one of the things
about voice acting,

01:03:59.206 --> 01:04:01.375
it's really important to
have a good microphone,

01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:03.510
otherwise it could
really kill your voice.

01:04:09.082 --> 01:04:10.785
Speaking of killing your voice,

01:04:10.819 --> 01:04:12.252
I think I have a sore throat,

01:04:12.286 --> 01:04:13.954
I gotta go, workshop canceled.

01:04:25.667 --> 01:04:28.268
This isn't worth 3,000 dollars.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:08.542
Okay.

01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:20.889
Mike Leonardo.

01:05:20.922 --> 01:05:22.724
Hey Mike, it's Jeff Nimoy.

01:05:24.358 --> 01:05:25.459
Hello?

01:05:25.492 --> 01:05:26.628
Jeff?

01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.128
Yeah hi, you
asked me to call you

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:29.864
about "Best Beach Paradises?"

01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:30.798
Yeah sorry, I'm trying

01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:32.967
to get the kids out of the room.

01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:33.902
Kids, huh?

01:05:35.369 --> 01:05:36.804
Hey Jeff look,

01:05:36.838 --> 01:05:38.305
I wanted to interview
you for the producer job,

01:05:38.338 --> 01:05:40.474
but then I saw your age on
Wikepedia, and to be honest,

01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:42.376
it's really a younger
man's job, man.

01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:44.846
Well, I'll tell you Mike,

01:05:44.879 --> 01:05:46.580
I can outwork any younger man,

01:05:46.614 --> 01:05:49.383
plus you're getting
all my experience.

01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:50.652
I know, I
know, but seriously,

01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:51.886
you're too senior for this role.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.655
I'd be embarrassed
to offer it to you.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:55.389
Don't be so embarrassed.

01:05:55.422 --> 01:05:56.624
I've often taken
a lower position

01:05:56.658 --> 01:06:00.929
just to prove myself to
the company, you know.

01:06:00.962 --> 01:06:02.095
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:03.363
I hope you find
something really soon,

01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:05.265
something that fits a
man with your resume.

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.634
Yeah, thanks.

01:06:07.501 --> 01:06:08.468
Good luck, buddy.

01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:11.906
Hey, if anything else
comes up in the future,

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.507
please keep me in mind, okay.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.976
Yeah yeah
sure, take care.

01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:31.158
Front desk,
how can I help you?

01:06:31.191 --> 01:06:32.694
Nikki Boyer.

01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:35.228
Hello?

01:06:35.262 --> 01:06:37.564
Hey it's me, I just got
done with my phone interview.

01:06:37.598 --> 01:06:39.333
Don't
ever call me again.

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:56.116
Room service.

01:06:56.149 --> 01:06:58.452
Yeah could I order a
bottle of Jack Daniels,

01:06:58.485 --> 01:06:59.988
and a bucket of ice?

01:07:00.021 --> 01:07:01.521
One glass.

01:07:01.555 --> 01:07:05.492
Well, we don't
actually give a whole bottle.

01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:08.029
We can either do an
individual bottle,

01:07:08.062 --> 01:07:11.866
or we can do a single drink
order, up to three drinks.

01:07:11.899 --> 01:07:12.867
Would you like
something like that?

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.702
No, I'll go down to the bar.

01:07:14.736 --> 01:07:19.674
Thank you.

01:07:46.868 --> 01:07:48.301
So ridiculous,

01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:49.904
it's like hanging out
with a bunch of children.

01:07:58.012 --> 01:07:58.980
Get undressed.

01:08:00.081 --> 01:08:01.115
Oh yes ma'am.

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:12.727
Hey, shot of Jack.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:15.295
Hey, food's
getting cold over here.

01:08:15.328 --> 01:08:16.328
I'll be right back.

01:08:20.033 --> 01:08:21.334
I'll be right back, too.

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:46.627
Mister Nimoy, can we
get a picture with you?

01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:48.696
No, but you can
do a shot with me.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:49.529
Who's in?

01:08:49.563 --> 01:08:50.765
Yes.

01:08:50.798 --> 01:08:51.899
All right, all
right, all right,

01:08:51.933 --> 01:08:56.336
all right, all right, all right.

01:08:56.368 --> 01:08:57.437
There you go.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:08:59.841
All right.

01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.475
Here's to adventures in anime.

01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:03.477
Yeah.

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:06.580
You son of a bitch.

01:09:06.613 --> 01:09:07.849
Get the fuck off me.

01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:08.850
Hey what the hell?

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:09.716
Jesus.

01:09:12.053 --> 01:09:12.854
Fuckin' asshole.

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:13.821
Save me Daddy.

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.091
Get back here
with my daughter.

01:09:18.126 --> 01:09:20.161
I'm gonna War Greymon your ass!

01:09:23.296 --> 01:09:26.033
What's up, Green Room?

01:09:26.067 --> 01:09:26.868
What's up my man?

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:28.568
Mister Nimoy.

01:09:28.603 --> 01:09:29.837
Club soda with lime?

01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:31.238
No no, screw that.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.340
You know how to
make a hurricane?

01:09:33.372 --> 01:09:34.407
All right, screw that too.

01:09:34.441 --> 01:09:35.676
Just give me Jack Daniels.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.611
All right.

01:09:36.644 --> 01:09:38.845
That's what I'm talking about.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.081
No no no no.

01:09:40.113 --> 01:09:42.750
I said, give me
the Jack Daniels.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.287
Whoa, that is epic,
just like Wolfwood.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:49.724
Whoo!

01:09:49.756 --> 01:09:51.358
Here you go kid, you
gotta be legal somewhere.

01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:55.295
Oh, that's my girl.

01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:57.799
Here you go buddy,

01:09:57.832 --> 01:10:00.601
that's all the autograph
money I made this weekend.

01:10:00.635 --> 01:10:01.969
Holy shit, no way.

01:10:02.904 --> 01:10:04.105
Thanks, Mister Nimoy.

01:11:36.097 --> 01:11:37.497
Oh Jesus.

01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:38.366
Wake up.

01:11:40.835 --> 01:11:43.671
Come on, time for you to go.

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:46.874
You have to wake up and go away.

01:11:48.743 --> 01:11:49.911
Get out.

01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:52.579
Hey, leave me alone now.

01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:53.446
Go!

01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:57.919
God, you are such an asshole!

01:12:04.557 --> 01:12:06.794
The only reason I wanted
to hook up with you,

01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:08.062
was to get back at my father,

01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:10.164
for leaving me here
in Madison, all alone.

01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:14.635
But you're just as
much of a selfish,

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:18.072
deadbeat, loser, as he is.

01:12:19.307 --> 01:12:20.675
Fuck you, Wolfwood.

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:38.359
Hey, this
is Nikki Boyer.

01:12:38.392 --> 01:12:40.094
Please leave me a message,
unless you're Jeff Nimoy,

01:12:40.127 --> 01:12:42.630
in which case, you can
pretty much fuck off and die.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:11.192
Fuck.

01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:33.607
Hello?

01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:34.475
Jeff?

01:14:35.409 --> 01:14:36.243
Jeff?

01:14:37.344 --> 01:14:38.712
Hey, it's Robert.

01:14:38.746 --> 01:14:41.382
Look, one of my story
producers on "House Flippers"

01:14:41.415 --> 01:14:43.150
just got appendicitis.

01:14:43.184 --> 01:14:45.585
I can get you approved because
it's a last minute thing.

01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:46.520
Are you available?

01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:49.156
Hello?

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:50.024
Hmm.

01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:52.159
Where are you?

01:14:53.527 --> 01:14:54.895
Madison.

01:14:54.929 --> 01:14:56.596
What, Wisconsin?

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.666
What are you doing there?

01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:01.869
I'm at an anime convention.

01:15:01.902 --> 01:15:03.204
Shit, can
you get back to LA?

01:15:03.237 --> 01:15:04.872
I need you here
tomorrow morning?

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:09.743
This is a big opportunity.

01:15:10.878 --> 01:15:13.180
Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

01:15:13.214 --> 01:15:14.448
Okay.

01:15:14.482 --> 01:15:15.783
This could be the break
you're looking for, man.

01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:19.620
Be at my office
at nine a.m. okay?

01:15:19.653 --> 01:15:21.722
Okay?

01:15:21.755 --> 01:15:22.990
I'll be there.

01:15:23.023 --> 01:15:24.225
Are you okay?

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.196
Yeah, I just woke
up, that's all.

01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:30.164
I wrote it down.

01:15:31.932 --> 01:15:33.033
Okay.

01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:33.968
I'll be there.

01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:35.803
Sorry to wake you.

01:15:35.836 --> 01:15:37.538
No, it's okay.

01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:39.306
Okay, bye.

01:15:40.908 --> 01:15:41.909
Thank you.

01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:53.454
You're not gonna eat?

01:15:53.487 --> 01:15:54.788
Mm-mm, I'm not hungry.

01:15:54.822 --> 01:15:56.357
I thought for sure
after last night

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:58.559
you'd work up an appetite.

01:15:59.994 --> 01:16:01.295
About last night, Brian.

01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:03.764
Wasn't it great?

01:16:04.932 --> 01:16:06.400
Actually I owe you an apology,

01:16:06.433 --> 01:16:08.068
because last night
was less of a,

01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:09.537
we're getting back
together, thing,

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:11.805
and more of a, revenge
against Jeff, thing.

01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:15.176
Well,

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:16.777
I figured something would
change your mind about him.

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:18.445
I didn't want to spoil
the mood, you know,

01:16:18.479 --> 01:16:19.614
make you come knocking.

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:24.218
You were right about him.

01:16:25.219 --> 01:16:26.086
No shit, right?

01:16:27.121 --> 01:16:28.322
What'd he do?

01:16:28.355 --> 01:16:30.424
He lied about the girl
that he took upstairs.

01:16:32.293 --> 01:16:33.127
What a dick.

01:16:34.028 --> 01:16:35.262
When I was at the buffet,

01:16:35.296 --> 01:16:36.964
I heard some fans
talking about him.

01:16:36.997 --> 01:16:39.166
Apparently Jeff was parading
around the con last night,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.535
dressed like one
of his characters,

01:16:41.569 --> 01:16:43.237
drunk off his ass.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.939
Oh no, really?

01:16:44.972 --> 01:16:47.642
Yeah, one day he's telling
everyone he's changed,

01:16:48.809 --> 01:16:50.578
but he's still the
same chain-smoking,

01:16:50.612 --> 01:16:54.415
hard-drinking, womanizing
pedophile that he's always been.

01:16:55.749 --> 01:16:57.484
Just like Wolfwood.

01:16:57.518 --> 01:16:59.753
Exactly, typecasting.

01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:02.624
I gotta make some
changes in my life.

01:17:03.524 --> 01:17:04.659
What do you mean?

01:17:04.693 --> 01:17:06.193
Look, I have a
history of doing this.

01:17:06.227 --> 01:17:07.127
I meet these new guys,

01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:08.329
and I fall in love with them

01:17:08.362 --> 01:17:09.964
without knowing
anything about them.

01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:13.100
Yeah, but you and
I weren't so bad,

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:14.468
and we could be good again.

01:17:15.704 --> 01:17:17.905
Last night was pretty good.

01:17:20.107 --> 01:17:23.377
Brian, we have to
take it slow, okay.

01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:27.214
Take it as slow
as you want to.

01:17:27.248 --> 01:17:28.617
- Oh my God.
- Excuse me Missus Boyer.

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:29.450
What do you want?

01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:30.517
I just want you to know...

01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:31.620
Would you both please go away.

01:17:31.653 --> 01:17:33.153
Yeah, can't you see
that this isn't the time?

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:34.521
I just wanted to say,

01:17:34.555 --> 01:17:36.590
I hope you and Jeff will
be very happy together.

01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:37.758
Are you kidding me right now?

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:39.460
Will you please just go away?

01:17:39.493 --> 01:17:40.861
You have nothing
to worry about,

01:17:40.894 --> 01:17:43.197
I won't be interfering
anymore in your relationship.

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:45.065
Okay first of all, there
isn't a relationship,

01:17:45.099 --> 01:17:46.333
and second of all,

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:48.637
you and weird-out old
man pervert boyfriend,

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:52.339
can screw all the way till
junior high for all I care, go.

01:17:52.373 --> 01:17:54.808
I told you, we
didn't have sex.

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:55.442
God.

01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:56.477
He couldn't get it up.

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.945
Just stop, stop.

01:17:57.978 --> 01:17:59.913
Okay, sorry.

01:17:59.947 --> 01:18:01.650
Just wanted you to
know we never did it,

01:18:01.683 --> 01:18:03.217
and we never will.

01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:04.653
I'm begging you at this point.

01:18:04.686 --> 01:18:07.554
Could you please just go away?

01:18:07.588 --> 01:18:09.056
You know, I
would have thought,

01:18:09.089 --> 01:18:10.557
after he was so drunk last night

01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:13.360
that he would have at least
like touched me, you know?

01:18:14.561 --> 01:18:16.964
Wait, so you guys did
not have sex last night?

01:18:16.997 --> 01:18:17.831
No.

01:18:18.999 --> 01:18:20.968
And he was also crying,
whispering your name.

01:18:22.303 --> 01:18:23.137
He did?

01:18:25.472 --> 01:18:26.307
Pathetic.

01:18:27.508 --> 01:18:28.342
How sweet.

01:18:29.243 --> 01:18:30.477
He could have at least sighed

01:18:30.511 --> 01:18:31.713
one of those morning sighs.

01:18:31.746 --> 01:18:34.148
Oh okay, right,
we're done, bye.

01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:38.118
You know, I told
him that I did it

01:18:38.152 --> 01:18:39.987
just to get back at
my dad, but like,

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.022
I think I really did like him.

01:18:42.056 --> 01:18:45.459
You know like,
probably not love.

01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:48.996
But I love the idea
of him, you know like,

01:18:50.497 --> 01:18:51.733
a celebrity and all.

01:18:56.638 --> 01:18:57.471
Sorry.

01:18:58.372 --> 01:18:59.173
Okay.

01:19:00.874 --> 01:19:01.776
Hold on.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:03.110
If you didn't have sex with him,

01:19:03.143 --> 01:19:04.845
then why did you
text me that you did?

01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:06.480
Can you please go away,
you're upsetting Miss Boyer.

01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:07.348
I never texted you.

01:19:07.381 --> 01:19:08.248
I don't have your number.

01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:09.383
You want me to get security?

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:10.217
No, it's fine.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.151
Yeah you did.

01:19:11.185 --> 01:19:12.654
I actually have it right here.

01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:15.589
I never sent that.

01:19:15.623 --> 01:19:16.990
Aren't you Lana?

01:19:17.024 --> 01:19:20.294
Yeah, and that's my number,
but I never sent that.

01:19:20.327 --> 01:19:21.395
Why would I?

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:23.364
Yeah, weird.

01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:25.199
Wait, what time was
that text message sent at?

01:19:25.232 --> 01:19:26.300
Let me get a muffin.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:27.935
Yesterday at 5:15 p.m.

01:19:27.968 --> 01:19:29.403
Does anybody want me
to get them anything?

01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:30.638
Wait, Mister Donovan,

01:19:30.672 --> 01:19:33.708
isn't that when I left
my phone at your table?

01:19:33.742 --> 01:19:34.676
You were so sweet.

01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:38.212
I ran away crying, and he
held on to my phone for me.

01:19:42.617 --> 01:19:45.653
Anyway, thanks for
coming to Madison.

01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:48.589
Okay.

01:19:48.623 --> 01:19:50.023
You're my favorite.

01:19:50.057 --> 01:19:51.291
Okay, all right.

01:19:51.325 --> 01:19:52.326
Okay.

01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:53.160
Bye guys.

01:19:53.193 --> 01:19:54.027
Bye.

01:19:58.065 --> 01:19:59.066
More coffee?

01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:01.101
I'll pour.

01:20:05.072 --> 01:20:05.840
Mister Donovan?

01:20:05.874 --> 01:20:06.841
Could we have a picture?

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:10.745
Thank you.

01:20:10.779 --> 01:20:11.578
You now.

01:20:11.613 --> 01:20:12.446
Me me.

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.018
- Thank you.
- Thanks,

01:20:18.051 --> 01:20:19.119
thanks a lot.

01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:28.929
10 please.

01:20:33.233 --> 01:20:34.702
I like your costume.

01:20:34.736 --> 01:20:38.071
Oh thanks, I was gonna cosplay
as Urahara from "Bleach."

01:20:38.105 --> 01:20:39.674
but I couldn't
find the right hat.

01:20:39.707 --> 01:20:40.909
I tried to dye
green streaks in it,

01:20:40.941 --> 01:20:43.510
but then the whole
thing turned green,

01:20:43.544 --> 01:20:45.446
so I went with Naruto instead.

01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:49.983
Mister Nimoy?

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.154
Mister Nimoy?

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:58.192
It's time for your
final autograph session.

01:21:02.563 --> 01:21:05.767
Mister Nimoy?

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.835
Mister Nimoy?

01:21:20.615 --> 01:21:21.716
Mister Nimoy?

01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:28.121
Hi Kyle, it's Bobbi.

01:21:28.155 --> 01:21:29.691
I'm just up at
Mister Nimoy's room

01:21:29.724 --> 01:21:31.391
to take him down for his
final autograph session,

01:21:31.425 --> 01:21:32.861
and he's not answering the door,

01:21:32.894 --> 01:21:34.696
and I called his phone
and I can hear it ringing

01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:36.530
from inside his hotel room.

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:37.966
I'm here, I'm here.

01:21:37.998 --> 01:21:39.500
Oh oh, he's here.

01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:40.902
He's here, never mind.

01:21:40.935 --> 01:21:42.236
Okay.

01:21:42.269 --> 01:21:44.137
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear
you I was in the bathroom.

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:45.572
It's okay, I'm just here

01:21:45.607 --> 01:21:47.341
to take you to your
final autograph session.

01:21:47.374 --> 01:21:48.776
Just give me a minute, okay?

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:50.077
I'm sorry.

01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:52.212
I just need a minute,
I woke up late.

01:21:52.246 --> 01:21:53.080
Okay.

01:21:54.616 --> 01:21:56.216
You have something.

01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:00.020
You got it.

01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:02.356
Okay?

01:22:04.626 --> 01:22:05.660
I'll meet you downstairs.

01:22:05.693 --> 01:22:07.528
Yeah, okay.

01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:09.530
Call me if you need anything.

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:18.171
Hello, Mister Nimoy.

01:22:18.205 --> 01:22:19.139
My name is Ryan,

01:22:19.172 --> 01:22:20.440
and I just wanted to say

01:22:20.474 --> 01:22:23.076
what an extreme pleasure
it is to meet you,

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:26.915
and I came all the way from
Kenosha to shake your hand.

01:22:29.751 --> 01:22:32.921
Ryan, no offense but,

01:22:34.087 --> 01:22:36.290
I've been shaking a lot
of hands this weekend,

01:22:37.659 --> 01:22:40.929
and I think I might be coming
down with something so,

01:22:41.796 --> 01:22:42.964
what I'm trying to say is,

01:22:42.997 --> 01:22:44.766
I think I'm done shaking
hands this weekend.

01:22:44.799 --> 01:22:45.800
No offense.

01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:50.605
Perfectly understandable sir,

01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:53.106
but please allow me
to give you this.

01:22:53.975 --> 01:22:55.075
You want me to sign this?

01:22:55.108 --> 01:22:58.846
No, that is my mother.

01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:01.515
You want me to
sign it for her.

01:23:01.548 --> 01:23:04.652
No no, I brought
it to you as a gift.

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:08.455
You brought me a photo
of your mother as a gift?

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:09.289
Yes sir.

01:23:10.825 --> 01:23:13.527
Thanks, I'll cherish it.

01:23:14.729 --> 01:23:18.866
Well she recently
had stage four cancer,

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.468
and while she was
undergoing chemo,

01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:26.273
we would sit and watch
episodes of Trigun together.

01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:29.811
Wolfwood was her
favorite character,

01:23:29.844 --> 01:23:32.046
both of ours actually.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.849
It was really the
only bright spot

01:23:34.882 --> 01:23:37.217
of either of our days,

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:40.655
sitting watching
Trigun together.

01:23:41.823 --> 01:23:44.859
When we heard you were
coming to Madison,

01:23:44.892 --> 01:23:47.160
she told me she was
going to get well enough

01:23:47.194 --> 01:23:49.162
to get up out of her sick bed

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:52.900
so that we could come here
and meet you together.

01:23:54.736 --> 01:23:58.106
So she was too
sick to come, huh?

01:23:58.138 --> 01:24:02.142
No sir, unfortunately she
passed away a few days ago.

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:06.848
But I wanted to bring
you a picture of her.

01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:10.852
That way it was like she
got to meet you after all.

01:24:12.519 --> 01:24:14.822
So thank you, Mister Nimoy,

01:24:14.856 --> 01:24:17.491
for everything you've
done to entertain,

01:24:17.524 --> 01:24:19.661
not only me and my mother,

01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:22.462
but millions around the world.

01:24:26.701 --> 01:24:27.534
Kid,

01:24:30.672 --> 01:24:32.640
I'm just a lousy voice actor,

01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:35.677
and I'm a hack
writer and director.

01:24:37.277 --> 01:24:38.311
I didn't do anything.

01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:42.850
But of course you did.

01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:45.285
No, kid.

01:24:46.586 --> 01:24:49.624
If it wasn't me it would
have been somebody else.

01:24:49.657 --> 01:24:51.759
But it was you,

01:24:51.793 --> 01:24:54.829
and you put your stamp on it.

01:24:54.862 --> 01:24:56.898
And we love it.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.901
We love you.

01:25:03.971 --> 01:25:05.640
So I can keep this?

01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:06.506
Yes.

01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:09.711
I'll cherish it.

01:25:12.814 --> 01:25:14.314
Mister Nimoy, I know you said

01:25:14.347 --> 01:25:17.451
you weren't giving out any
more handshakes or hugs,

01:25:17.484 --> 01:25:20.021
and I am kicking myself
I did not get here

01:25:20.054 --> 01:25:21.823
a day earlier when
you still were,

01:25:21.856 --> 01:25:24.025
but the funeral was yesterday,

01:25:24.058 --> 01:25:26.861
and I was wondering if
maybe I put a glove on,

01:25:26.894 --> 01:25:27.762
if you would...

01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:28.930
It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:31.099 --> 01:25:31.933
It's okay.

01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:44.078
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:25:49.817 --> 01:25:51.619
Thank you sir.

01:25:55.857 --> 01:25:58.192
You guys, I have time
for one more question

01:25:58.226 --> 01:26:00.260
before I head to the airport.

01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:02.029
Let's see.

01:26:02.063 --> 01:26:03.731
I have a question.

01:26:09.203 --> 01:26:11.304
Please, just one question.

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:12.707
Jeff, not here.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.242
Well, you're not
answering any of my calls,

01:26:14.274 --> 01:26:17.678
so you have to answer
me now, you're stuck.

01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:19.614
Please, just one question.

01:26:19.647 --> 01:26:21.082
What's the question?

01:26:21.115 --> 01:26:22.083
Okay well,

01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:24.185
didn't realize until now

01:26:24.218 --> 01:26:25.920
I'd have to do this
in front of everybody,

01:26:25.953 --> 01:26:28.455
but okay it is what it is.

01:26:30.258 --> 01:26:31.092
I'm sorry.

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:33.527
I'm sorry for everything.

01:26:34.896 --> 01:26:38.532
But I'm especially sorry
that I bent the truth,

01:26:38.565 --> 01:26:41.135
but Nikki, it was the truth.

01:26:41.169 --> 01:26:42.637
I didn't sleep with her.

01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:45.372
I did want to, but
I didn't do it.

01:26:45.405 --> 01:26:46.641
For God's sake Jeff.

01:26:46.674 --> 01:26:48.943
Please just hear me out.

01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:53.480
I couldn't, for lack
of a better term,

01:26:55.082 --> 01:26:55.983
perform.

01:26:56.017 --> 01:26:59.086
Oh shit yeah, limp dick.

01:27:03.925 --> 01:27:05.559
The point is,

01:27:07.995 --> 01:27:12.033
I couldn't do with her or
anyone for almost 10 years.

01:27:12.066 --> 01:27:13.901
But with you, I had no problem.

01:27:20.274 --> 01:27:22.475
Look, I've been stripped
down to raw honesty,

01:27:22.509 --> 01:27:26.914
and I can't do it with
any girl that's not real,

01:27:26.948 --> 01:27:29.250
and with you Nikki, it was real.

01:27:33.221 --> 01:27:34.922
Hey look, I'm not
oblivious to my reputation,

01:27:34.956 --> 01:27:36.057
I know what people say about me,

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:38.726
that I screw fangirls
at every con.

01:27:38.759 --> 01:27:39.827
That's probably why
I haven't gotten

01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:41.561
invited anywhere for so long.

01:27:41.595 --> 01:27:45.800
But I'm older now, and
I'm trying to be better.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:48.936
I'm a work in progress,
like everyone else.

01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:51.504
I mean, I'm working it out.

01:27:51.538 --> 01:27:53.341
Do you have
everything worked out?

01:27:56.711 --> 01:27:57.879
What's your question?

01:28:00.281 --> 01:28:01.716
Will you please forgive me?

01:28:07.788 --> 01:28:10.691
Thank you guys so much for
being here, I'm so grateful.

01:28:10.725 --> 01:28:12.392
I will see you next year.

01:28:12.425 --> 01:28:13.728
You guys take care, okay?

01:28:25.072 --> 01:28:25.907
So?

01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:31.511
So, how did the
phone interview go?

01:28:32.545 --> 01:28:33.381
Not good.

01:28:36.384 --> 01:28:37.885
Well, it could
be a good thing,

01:28:37.919 --> 01:28:39.419
'cause I reached out
to the booking agent

01:28:39.452 --> 01:28:40.688
for the Digimon tour,

01:28:40.721 --> 01:28:42.189
and she reached out to
the people in Denver,

01:28:42.223 --> 01:28:44.125
at the anime convention.

01:28:44.158 --> 01:28:46.227
They're dying to have you.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.962
And they can give
you a few grand,

01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:48.896
for this one,

01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:52.033
and maybe more for other cities.

01:28:54.235 --> 01:28:56.604
You did all that for me?

01:28:56.637 --> 01:28:57.805
Yeah, I did.

01:28:59.707 --> 01:29:01.375
So you forgive me?

01:29:03.244 --> 01:29:05.613
You really shouldn't have
been with a girl that young.

01:29:05.646 --> 01:29:07.148
I know.

01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:09.549
This whole place,
it's an ego trip.

01:29:11.686 --> 01:29:12.687
I'm flawed, Nikki.

01:29:14.622 --> 01:29:15.823
The problem is, is that

01:29:16.757 --> 01:29:18.525
I fall in love too quickly.

01:29:19.526 --> 01:29:20.661
And you fall for people

01:29:20.695 --> 01:29:22.363
who fall in love
with you too quickly.

01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:26.434
You know I didn't
tell you everything

01:29:26.466 --> 01:29:27.802
about the first time we met.

01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:32.006
I actually asked you a
question at your panel.

01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:36.077
I said, so how do you break
into the voiceover industry?

01:29:38.145 --> 01:29:39.546
You know what you said?

01:29:40.881 --> 01:29:42.083
Probably what I tell everybody

01:29:42.116 --> 01:29:43.516
at these conventions, right?

01:29:44.385 --> 01:29:46.354
You gotta go where the work is,

01:29:46.387 --> 01:29:48.155
and no one's hiring
in Saint Louis,

01:29:49.256 --> 01:29:50.424
and you gotta go to LA.

01:29:51.726 --> 01:29:53.361
And that is
exactly what I did.

01:29:54.561 --> 01:29:57.597
And I went from being
a fan who attends cons,

01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:00.001
to a VIP guest at cons,

01:30:00.034 --> 01:30:02.837
and that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.

01:30:06.741 --> 01:30:07.574
You matter.

01:30:10.711 --> 01:30:13.714
So, do I forgive you?

01:30:15.182 --> 01:30:15.983
Yes.

01:30:17.718 --> 01:30:20.755
But, we need to
start from scratch.

01:30:20.788 --> 01:30:22.790
You know, get to know
each other slowly.

01:30:23.724 --> 01:30:25.626
Work out our flaws,

01:30:25.659 --> 01:30:28.362
if this is gonna work out.

01:30:28.396 --> 01:30:29.964
That sounds good.

01:30:30.831 --> 01:30:32.500
So are you coming to Denver?

01:30:35.903 --> 01:30:37.238
There's a slight wrinkle.

01:30:38.372 --> 01:30:40.808
What?

01:30:40.841 --> 01:30:44.078
My brother-in-law finally
came through with a job.

01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:45.646
But it starts tomorrow,

01:30:46.579 --> 01:30:47.415
in LA.

01:30:50.451 --> 01:30:51.285
Well,

01:30:54.121 --> 01:30:56.657
I guess it comes down to
what you want out of life.

01:30:58.426 --> 01:30:59.393
But either way,

01:31:03.397 --> 01:31:04.698
you gotta go where the work is.

01:31:17.878 --> 01:31:18.746
We're good now.

01:31:19.613 --> 01:31:22.016
Don't do it again, all right?

01:32:34.623 --> 01:32:35.890
- I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

01:32:35.923 --> 01:32:37.424
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:38.859
First thing in the morning.

01:32:38.893 --> 01:32:40.694
Less chipper than
that tomorrow morning

01:32:40.728 --> 01:32:41.562
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:32:50.471 --> 01:32:51.705
It was Arnold Schwarzenegger

01:32:51.739 --> 01:32:53.642
as like the ringmaster
of the circus, right?

01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:54.909
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:54.942 --> 01:32:58.245
this next poodle
dances and sings.

01:33:09.523 --> 01:33:11.692
Is there anything
I can do for you,

01:33:11.725 --> 01:33:13.561
because you seem
to be loitering?

01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:26.373
Well we never said anything
about my room tonight.

01:33:27.741 --> 01:33:28.742
My room tonight.

01:33:54.802 --> 01:33:56.003
See you in the morning.

01:33:56.036 --> 01:33:56.837
Okay, goodbye.

01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:57.504
Okay bye.

01:33:57.538 --> 01:33:58.707
You have a room too, right?

01:33:58.739 --> 01:33:59.573
Yeah, right next door.

01:34:00.741 --> 01:34:01.542
Great.

01:34:01.575 --> 01:34:02.409
Mm-hmm.

01:34:35.175 --> 01:34:37.177
It was Arnold Schwarzenegger
as a brain surgeon.

01:34:37.211 --> 01:34:38.912
Oh yeah, I could
put down the scalpel,

01:34:38.946 --> 01:34:41.015
and he said, he's the nurse.

01:34:41.048 --> 01:34:41.915
Here's a toomer.

01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:56.851
