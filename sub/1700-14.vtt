WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.462
I'm telling you, Ross, she wants you.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.465
She barely knows me.
We just live in the same building.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.051
- Any contact?
- She lent me an egg once.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.469
You're in.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.097
Oh, right.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.599
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.899
Come on, Ross. You gotta get back
in the game here.

00:26.151 --> 00:30.279
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you...

00:31.239 --> 00:33.115
I don't think we need a third.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.577
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
over here, still in the shell?

00:36.786 --> 00:37.828
An egg?

00:38.079 --> 00:42.958
Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg."

00:43.543 --> 00:45.169
I think it's winning.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.255
- I think it's insane.
- She'll love it.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.426
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Here.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.514
Go with the egg, my friend.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.311
Go, go, go.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.566
- Think it'll work?
- It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.119
- You cannot do this.
- What? Do what?

02:00.370 --> 02:01.912
Roger wants to take her out.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.165
No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.334
Because he was creepy.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.253
And mean. And a little frightening.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.048
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.259
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.137
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.097
I know I do.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.599
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.269
What are you doing tomorrow night?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.813
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.192
- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight...
- No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.904
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.990
But her friend sounds like such a...

02:38.241 --> 02:40.450
Pathetic mess. I know, but...

02:40.994 --> 02:44.246
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable. I'm thinking:

02:50.211 --> 02:51.253
Thanks.

02:52.255 --> 02:56.008
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.135
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.304
- She said yes.
- Ahem.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.889
Yes! Way to go, man.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.143
- Still got the egg, huh?
- Yeah.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.909
- How do I look?
- Oh, um...

03:22.076 --> 03:23.452
...I don't care.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.582
There's Lorraine.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.584
Now, remember, no trading.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.128
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.881
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.676
Well, well.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.511
Look what you brought.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.222
Very nice.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.225
And what did you bring?

03:47.936 --> 03:49.645
She's checking her coat.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.190
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

03:53.441 --> 03:57.236
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

04:01.950 --> 04:06.411
Janice?

04:07.747 --> 04:08.956
Oh...

04:09.207 --> 04:10.415
...my...

04:10.667 --> 04:11.875
...God.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.173
Hey, it's Janice.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.765
Okay, I'm making a break for it.
I'm going out the window.

04:27.016 --> 04:31.645
No, don't, please. I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.064
- Just calm down.
- Calm down? Calm down?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.109
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.694
Hey.

04:39.612 --> 04:43.156
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous...

04:46.536 --> 04:48.745
...and I can't go when I'm nervous.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.456
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.547
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

05:00.258 --> 05:03.969
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.096
- Which one was he?
- Pete the Weeper?

05:06.347 --> 05:10.017
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

05:10.518 --> 05:13.020
"Oh, was it good for you?"

05:15.148 --> 05:19.401
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.695
"I win. I win."

05:23.114 --> 05:26.491
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.495
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.582
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.336
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.215
There's more beer, right?

05:44.302 --> 05:47.471
Oh. You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.767
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle...

05:52.018 --> 05:54.311
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.650
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.528
Yeah.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.740
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.825
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.453
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

06:11.704 --> 06:15.749
Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff
they gave us.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.293
Or?

06:18.544 --> 06:23.340
Or we can chant and dance around naked,
you know, with sticks.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.677
- Burning's good.
- Burning's good.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.471
I've got stuff to burn.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.564
You know...

06:39.732 --> 06:44.194
...ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.072
Yeah? Good for you.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.120
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

06:58.626 --> 07:02.421
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.133
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.177
That's okay.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.598
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.352
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.606
We can't do that.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.860
What? What can't you do?

07:27.155 --> 07:30.323
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

07:36.289 --> 07:39.583
Uh, we might be leaving now.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.377
Tell me it's you and me "we."

07:43.880 --> 07:47.883
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.802
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.930
But I definitely want to be
a part of it.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.018
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.730
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

08:01.939 --> 08:06.234
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.403
I'm out of here.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.533
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.369
I hope she throws up on you.

08:18.831 --> 08:19.873
Thanks.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.961
- So...
- Just us.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.631
Ugh, what a crappy night.

08:27.965 --> 08:32.092
Although I have enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out...

08:32.345 --> 08:35.222
...of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.477
Excuse me.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.274
How you doing?

08:51.531 --> 08:55.116
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

08:55.368 --> 08:57.702
Joey's not a friend. He's...

08:59.664 --> 09:02.958
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.088
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

09:08.422 --> 09:09.923
I will go for that drink.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.716
You got it. Good woman.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.641
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.518
- Each.
- That's right. Each.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.687
Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.523
I've always wanted to know.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.503
Happy Valentine's Day.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.888
Oh, I miss you already.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.975
Can you believe this happened?

10:02.226 --> 10:03.685
No, no.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.605
And yet it did.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.774
- Goodbye, Janice.
- Kiss me.

10:12.653 --> 10:17.532
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.870
- Hey, Janice.
- Hi, Monica.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.998
Okay. Well, this was very special.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.127
Rach, come see who's out here.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.505
What's going on...?
Oh, my God.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.883
Janice. Hi.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.053
Janice is gonna go away now.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.056
I'll be right back.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.268
Oh. Joey. Look who it is.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.103
Whoa.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.982
Oh, good. Joey's home now.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.568
This is so much fun.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.154
This is like a reunion in the hall.

10:58.949 --> 11:02.035
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.747
He just happened to call.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.417
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
It's me. How did you know?

11:16.592 --> 11:20.303
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then...

11:20.554 --> 11:24.849
...because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing...

11:25.101 --> 11:28.395
...that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

11:28.604 --> 11:32.774
...he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.780
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.710
What?

11:55.131 --> 11:56.256
Who are they?

11:56.590 --> 11:58.758
The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.053
And the woman touching her is her...

12:02.471 --> 12:04.472
...close personal friend.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.768
You mean they're lovers?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.104
If you want to put a label on it.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.399
Wow. Heh.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.485
- Anything else I should know?
- Nope. That's it.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.364
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.412
I always forget that part.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.623
Hello.

12:37.173 --> 12:42.093
Okay. So now we need, um,
sage branches and the sacramental wine.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.473
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.516
Um, that's okay.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.979
- Ooh.
- Okay.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.941
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.783
Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...

13:04.950 --> 13:07.160
...we wouldn't be doing the ritual
in the first place.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.332
- Can we start throwing things in?
- Um, yeah, okay.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.210
Oh. Okay. Um...

13:16.003 --> 13:17.587
Okay. Barry's letters.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.633
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.135
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with:

13:30.059 --> 13:33.353
- A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
- Let me see.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.188
He's wearing a sweater.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.398
- No.
- Ew!

13:41.111 --> 13:44.906
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.658
Wait. Isn't it almost pure...?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.707
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.919
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.967
Oh, man. In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.304
Hello, funny valentine.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.057
Hi, just Janice.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.519
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.605
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

14:17.773 --> 14:21.901
Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.321
If you don't do it, I will.

14:38.168 --> 14:41.379
So, um, what do you do for a living?

14:41.589 --> 14:42.922
Well, um for the past few years...

14:44.508 --> 14:47.176
Oh, no. You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.428
I thought they could.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.931
- Working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.393
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.938
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science, heh...

14:59.189 --> 15:02.942
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.956
Now, that is funny.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.502
Hey, do you think...?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.715
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

15:25.966 --> 15:28.051
Because she's alone now.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.386
And pregnant. And sad.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.014
- I guess.
- Are you sure?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.682
Thanks. Carol.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.185
Wanna come over and join us?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.645
Oh, no. I'm fine.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.981
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down. Come on.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.401
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

15:45.736 --> 15:48.655
Let's try scooching. Come on.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.990
- Come on.
- Thank you.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.204
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.915
- Carol, Kristen.
- How do you do?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.417
Um... Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.170
And, uh, Kristen...

16:07.508 --> 16:09.842
Kristen does something...

16:11.387 --> 16:13.096
...that, funnily enough...

16:14.932 --> 16:16.391
...wasn't even her major.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.188
What do we got there?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.441
A piece of silk boxer shorts...

16:26.068 --> 16:27.694
...some greeting cards...

16:28.362 --> 16:31.364
...what looks like a
half-charred picture of...

16:32.032 --> 16:34.534
Wow, that guy's hairier
than the chief.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.499
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.501
It's all right. Don't explain.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.838
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.843
- You're our third call tonight.
- Really?

16:52.094 --> 16:55.179
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.226
I brought you something.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.936
Is it loaded?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.233
Oh, little candy hearts.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.280
"Chan and Jan forever."

17:12.698 --> 17:14.824
I had them made special.

17:18.619 --> 17:19.871
Okay, Janice.

17:20.955 --> 17:21.998
Janice.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.751
Hey, Janice.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.214
Look, there's no way for me
to tell you this.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.009
At least, there's no new way
for me to tell you this.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.931
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.852
That's fine.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.357
- It is?
- Mm-hm.

17:48.609 --> 17:52.195
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.741
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.827
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.537
Don't you know it yet?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.957
You love me, Chandler Bing.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.755
Oh, no, I don't.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.258
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.344
New Year's, who invited who?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.472
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

18:19.723 --> 18:22.141
- I did, but...
- You seek me out.

18:22.392 --> 18:27.522
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.651
Janice. Janice.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.237
You want me. You need me.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.698
You can't live without me.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.575
And you know it.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.830
You just don't know you know it.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.335
See you.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.510
Call me.

19:06.103 --> 19:10.106
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.859
You did so. I swear.
I swear to...

19:16.780 --> 19:19.157
How long has she been in the bathroom?

19:19.366 --> 19:23.244
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.580
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.169
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.921
- That could be it.
- Oh, God.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.633
You know, this is still pretty hot.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.472
Mushroom.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.017
Smile.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.980
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.483
- I'm sorry. That's not funny.
- No, it's just...

19:55.235 --> 19:58.738
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

19:58.989 --> 20:01.032
Well, do I have to?

20:01.491 --> 20:06.329
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

20:06.580 --> 20:08.623
...and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.750
But there's...

20:12.044 --> 20:13.169
That's it.

20:14.213 --> 20:19.133
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.844
And I don't have to...

20:22.262 --> 20:23.846
- I know.
- You know?

20:27.976 --> 20:31.145
Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.

20:31.313 --> 20:35.107
- Let's say you and I give it another shot.
- Ross.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.568
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

20:39.780 --> 20:44.575
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

20:44.826 --> 20:47.328
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

20:47.579 --> 20:50.456
Because we're great together,
you know?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.750
You can't deny it.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.170
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.173
- I mean, how perfect is that?
- Ross...

20:59.424 --> 21:02.343
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.552
I love you.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.604
I love you too.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.941
- But...
- No "but." No "but."

21:18.944 --> 21:22.113
You know that thing
we put over here with the pin in it?

21:25.033 --> 21:27.618
It's time to take the pin out.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.457
Yeah.

21:34.084 --> 21:38.004
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.090
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.470
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.934
Not her.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.489
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.366
- Okay.
- Great.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.703
So, um, will you bring the truck?

22:13.206 --> 22:15.708
- I'll even let you ring the bell.
- Wohoo!

22:15.876 --> 22:18.836
- We'll see you later.
- Bye. See you later.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.755
Thanks. See you.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.256
Oh, my God.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.092
See, there you go.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.720
- The cleansing worked.
- You're right.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.430
They're nice guys.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.058
They're firemen guys.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.020
- You tell them you're married?
- No way.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.439
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them.
