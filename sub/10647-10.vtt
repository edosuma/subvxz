00:02.875 --> 00:04.582
Friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man here,

00:04.628 --> 00:07.193
and I've been dealing with
some pretty heavy stuff recently.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.062
CONNORS:
Almost there.

00:12.465 --> 00:14.781
Almost there.

00:16.245 --> 00:18.611
This kinda heavy?
No problemo.

00:18.657 --> 00:21.041
Proportionate strength of
a spider blah, blah, blah...

00:21.087 --> 00:24.181
But the real heavy is what's going
on with S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

00:24.227 --> 00:25.316
<i>Fury is still missing.</i>

00:25.362 --> 00:27.248
<i>Rhino turned horn
and betrayed us.</i>

00:27.294 --> 00:29.586
<i>And Doc Ock
sidelined Agent Venom.</i>

00:29.632 --> 00:31.320
Some leader
I turned out to be.

00:31.366 --> 00:34.577
I should win LVP,
Least Valuable Player.

00:34.787 --> 00:36.224
Be careful.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.751
Don't wanna damage the power supply
to my anti-Hydra weapon.

00:40.077 --> 00:41.815
Anti-Hydra weapon?

00:41.861 --> 00:44.003
Okay. A, nice.

00:44.049 --> 00:46.638
And two, might wanna
rethink the name.

00:46.684 --> 00:48.119
Kinda obvious.

00:48.230 --> 00:51.888
Whatever you say,
Spider... Man.

00:52.345 --> 00:53.757
Touche.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.372
(MACHINE POWERING UP)

01:04.302 --> 01:07.203
A-ha! Science success.

01:07.297 --> 01:08.363
It took some work,

01:08.409 --> 01:10.099
but this is the most
powerful weapon

01:10.145 --> 01:12.687
we have in our battle
against Hydra.

01:20.712 --> 01:22.966
Whoa! And you're
keeping it here?

01:23.012 --> 01:26.763
You realize that everyone and their
mother's infiltrated the Triskelion at least once?

01:26.809 --> 01:28.396
Sometimes twice.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.008
SPIDER-MAN:
What's this?

01:35.389 --> 01:38.601
The weapon key.
It can't function without it.

01:38.986 --> 01:42.351
Put this somewhere
no one would ever look,

01:42.621 --> 01:43.614
even me.

01:43.660 --> 01:47.090
Got the perfect place... maybe.

this through. (BEEPING)

Huh? Ben?

02:01.450 --> 02:03.472
<i>Tell me you're on your way, Punk.</i>

02:03.518 --> 02:07.229
Duh, I'm totally on my way
to, uh, to where again?

02:07.275 --> 02:09.448
<i>Aunt May's birthday party.</i>

02:09.494 --> 02:11.275
<i>You picked up the cake, right?</i>

02:11.514 --> 02:14.037
Sure did.

02:14.083 --> 02:15.017
Sure didn't!

02:15.063 --> 02:18.010
Sorry, Dr. Connors,
gotta run, urgent situation.

02:18.158 --> 02:20.652
Okay, Mission Cake,
complete success.

02:20.698 --> 02:22.471
Now let's get
this party started.

02:24.481 --> 02:26.284
Unless there's
an emergency.

02:30.578 --> 02:31.726
Hey, Shriek!

02:31.772 --> 02:34.092
I'm not sure that's
an authorized withdrawal.

02:34.138 --> 02:36.366
How about I withdraw
the breath from your body?

02:36.412 --> 02:37.707
(GRUNTS)

02:37.753 --> 02:40.840
Attack me all you want,
just do not touch this cake.

02:40.886 --> 02:43.011
Not the cake.
Not the cake.
Not the cake!

Stop, you're putting
innocent cake at risk.

02:59.204 --> 03:02.095
That's funny,
I thought you said cake.

I'm outta... Whoa!

(GASPS)

03:36.567 --> 03:38.189
No matter
how fast you run,

03:38.235 --> 03:40.726
I'll always be
able to "ketchup".

03:42.126 --> 03:43.237
See what I did there?

03:43.283 --> 03:45.516
Not sure I'll be
topping that joke.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.749
One quick change later,

03:51.795 --> 03:54.075
and I'm just your friendly

- J. Jonah?

04:03.648 --> 04:04.794
Oh, Ben!

04:04.840 --> 04:06.006
Hey!

04:06.052 --> 04:07.301
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:09.061 --> 04:10.369
Welcome to

<i>Ben Riley, named after
my uncle, is Scarlet Spider.</i>

<i>but when he is not injured,
he's Agent Venom.</i>

04:30.661 --> 04:34.459
Oh, Peter,
punctual as always.

04:35.418 --> 04:37.889
Oh, Aunt May,
you're gonna ruin my rep.

04:37.935 --> 04:41.332
Oh, so you can face monsters
and madmen as Spider-Man,

04:41.378 --> 04:43.121
but not kisses?

04:43.167 --> 04:45.053
Even on my birthday?

04:45.859 --> 04:46.816
Hmm.

04:46.862 --> 04:50.352
Oh, Peter,
you're gonna ruin my rep.

04:51.297 --> 04:54.100
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:54.492 --> 04:56.632
So, now where were we?

04:58.166 --> 04:59.754
(SOFTLY) You brought
the cake, right?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.939
Brought it?
I fought crime with it.

05:01.985 --> 05:03.886
We had a team-up together.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.907
I'm not even gonna ask.

05:07.953 --> 05:12.607
What? But...
But if that's here...

05:16.774 --> 05:20.122
Okay, I'll get this to
the NYPD as soon as possible.

05:20.168 --> 05:21.200
Think they'll give
the cake back,

05:21.246 --> 05:22.728
or will it be
impounded as evidence?

05:22.774 --> 05:23.963
Doesn't matter.

05:24.049 --> 05:26.549
'Cause based on the fact
that I actually know you,

05:26.737 --> 05:28.815
I expected this. So...

05:32.361 --> 05:33.548
Backup cake?

05:33.659 --> 05:34.706
Backup cake.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.893
Dude! Thanks for being
someone I can always count on.

05:38.315 --> 05:40.870
You're just lucky
you have a cool aunt.

05:41.182 --> 05:43.963
You really surrounded
yourself with a good bunch.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.307
And we wouldn't
be here without you.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.053
Happy birthday, Aunt May.

05:50.151 --> 05:52.510
Thanks for always being
there, no matter what.

05:52.581 --> 05:54.073
And for making me
feel at home,

05:54.119 --> 05:55.940
even though I am not even
from this dimension.

05:56.049 --> 05:58.268
For taking me in
when I got injured.

05:58.365 --> 06:00.532
For helping me always look
on the bright side,

06:00.578 --> 06:01.877
even if it's illogical.

06:01.948 --> 06:03.284
For giving me
my name.

06:04.204 --> 06:05.987
Oh! (SIGHS)

06:14.581 --> 06:16.991
(SIGHS) I don't even
know what to say.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.469
Thank you truly, boys.

06:19.641 --> 06:22.446
Oh, and Connors
at S.H.I.E.L.D. got you a gift too.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.289
Uh... Here.

06:25.008 --> 06:28.469
It's wonderful.
What is it?

06:28.562 --> 06:31.758
Art. Very modern,
very thought-provoking.

06:31.844 --> 06:33.642
That's got to
be the ugliest...

06:33.688 --> 06:35.680
It's art.
Art's not ugly.

06:35.727 --> 06:39.414
I believe it is scientifically impossible
for an object to be any uglier.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.563
Look how we are already
talking about it.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.243
Thought-provoking
indeed, I love it.

06:44.308 --> 06:45.206
(CHUCKLES)

06:45.308 --> 06:48.339

to love something that repulsive.

Uh... Aunt May?

06:57.258 --> 06:58.680
Well, what are you
waiting for?

06:58.726 --> 07:01.152
Go be heroes,
my party can wait.

07:01.699 --> 07:03.662
Let's go, guys!

07:05.540 --> 07:07.345
Better let the rest of us
handle this one, buddy.

07:07.454 --> 07:08.704
Oh, man.

07:08.802 --> 07:10.954
But you have to do
the most important job.

07:11.103 --> 07:13.017
Keep an eye
on Aunt May.

07:13.181 --> 07:16.475
You got it.
No one will get past me.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.720
Still nothing new over come.

07:26.775 --> 07:30.345
They're just transmitting the automated
distress signal, over and over.

07:30.391 --> 07:31.648
Be ready for anything,

07:31.742 --> 07:33.703
this could be
a massive attack.

07:35.359 --> 07:39.195
(GRUNTS)
Or one madman by himself.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.461
Give it up, Ock!

07:40.586 --> 07:42.547
You're between
a web and a hard fist.

07:42.656 --> 07:45.103
If you're smart, which you've told me
a zillion times you are,

07:45.149 --> 07:46.836
just turn yourself in.

07:46.969 --> 07:49.687
Wait, are you
turning yourself in?

07:49.836 --> 07:53.747
(CHUCKLES) Ever the optimist,
of course not.

07:53.793 --> 07:56.669
I'm just here to reacquaint you
with some old friends.

07:56.740 --> 08:00.376
Electro, Rhino, Kraven,

08:00.454 --> 08:03.384
Goblin, Hydro-Man,

08:03.509 --> 08:06.839
I assume you can do
the math, Spider-Man.

08:06.964 --> 08:10.683
SPIDER-MAN: You did it.
You put together a new Sinister Six.

08:11.144 --> 08:13.355
Don't let anyone ever tell you
you're not predictable.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.214
Sinister Six
or Sinister Sixty,

08:16.355 --> 08:17.745
we can stop 'em.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.305
Just lead
the way, Spidey.

08:20.307 --> 08:22.201
Last time I led a teammate
into battle with Doc Ock,

08:22.247 --> 08:23.872
they ended up in a wheelchair.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.591
I cannot let
that happen again.

08:25.646 --> 08:27.349
What's the plan?

08:27.849 --> 08:29.037
SPIDER-MAN: Retreat.
(BEEPS)

08:29.083 --> 08:31.350
Finally! Wait, what?
(ALL SCREAMING)

08:34.192 --> 08:35.926
This way.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.091
We ran away! Why?

08:39.222 --> 08:41.279
Just trust me
on this, Scarlet.

08:43.025 --> 08:45.961
KID ARACHNID: This is a major attack,
what's wrong with all of you?

08:46.056 --> 08:47.263
Wrong with us?

08:47.317 --> 08:49.050
The distress call must
have been faked.

08:49.115 --> 08:51.165
He clearly got into
our security systems.

08:51.328 --> 08:52.961
And he's taken
over our come.

08:53.173 --> 08:55.025
Who we talking
about here?

08:55.172 --> 08:57.158
Doc Ock and
his new Sinister Six.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.158
But I've got it under control,
Fury left evacuation plans.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.490
Let's move, people.

09:02.683 --> 09:04.642
Didn't you hear?
Time to go!

09:04.755 --> 09:07.213
Squirrel Girl, pack up
Tippy Toes' acorns.

09:07.822 --> 09:09.291
Don't you get it, Punk?

09:09.760 --> 09:10.713
Look at them.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.908
You brought most of them here.
You made them into a team.

09:14.133 --> 09:17.469
Now this is their home and
they are not ready to abandon it.

09:17.705 --> 09:19.854
Look, I don't have exactly
the best track record

09:19.900 --> 09:22.150
when it comes to taking
on Ock directly. I...

09:22.213 --> 09:24.213
Forget Fury's
evacuation plan,

09:24.353 --> 09:26.166
we need you to lead.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.955
Can you do it?

09:28.080 --> 09:30.465
DR. OCTOPUS: The day has come,
my Sinister Six.

09:30.592 --> 09:34.856
All that stands between you
and everything you've ever wanted

09:34.950 --> 09:38.333
is Spider-Man and
his so-called heroes.

09:38.598 --> 09:40.018
What are you going to do?

09:40.278 --> 09:42.054
SINISTER SIX:
Destroy them!

09:42.722 --> 09:44.389
(ALL GRUNTING)

09:50.237 --> 09:53.054
they run when faced with
the might of our boot.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.878
We shall overrun their lair.

09:54.925 --> 09:57.102
Lair?
Who talks like that?

09:57.191 --> 10:00.644
Oh, I know,
megalomaniacal supervillains.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.998
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy,
where heroes are trained.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.214
Come on, team,

10:05.323 --> 10:06.987
let's show 'em
what we've learned.

10:09.332 --> 10:10.825
All right,
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy,

10:10.905 --> 10:13.442
let's send Ock's
Sinister Six packing.

Want sharp knives, Kraven?

10:19.831 --> 10:21.714
Try sharp stingers!

could use a little help

I did not miss this guy!

10:43.792 --> 10:46.652
Miles, we trained for exactly this.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.363
SPIDER-MAN:
Look for Goblin's normal attack pattern.

10:48.389 --> 10:54.079
One, two, three,
four, five, now!

10:54.208 --> 10:55.874
(ROARING)

10:57.418 --> 10:58.731
Nailed it.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.352
SPIDER-MAN:
Not surprised...

11:01.541 --> 11:02.676
Whoa!

11:05.239 --> 11:07.246
I'm the mouse
to this guy's cat.

11:07.371 --> 11:09.651
His electrical blast
will short out my armor.

11:09.761 --> 11:12.567
Reroute your armor for offensive
attacks and defend with the webbing.

I say stupid things.

11:33.187 --> 11:35.043
Rhino, why are we
fighting, buddy?

11:35.398 --> 11:36.989
You can't stand Doc Ock.

11:37.078 --> 11:40.615
Must obey Octopus.

a number on your brain, huh?

Oh, no! Keep them away!

12:12.893 --> 12:16.094
I trusted you, Rhino.
But you betrayed us.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.653
Were you Ock's spy the whole time
you were in the Academy?

12:18.703 --> 12:23.453
Was never a spy.
Ock just used me to escape.

12:24.218 --> 12:28.140
You weren't the spy?
Then who... Ah!

12:33.079 --> 12:34.903
Ugh. Wipe-out.

12:34.986 --> 12:38.893
You look thirsty.
Have a drink on me.

pretty well hydrated already.

We don't. Give him
a trip, Cloak.

13:13.050 --> 13:15.480
You can't run
from an Elemental.

13:16.628 --> 13:17.980
Why would we run...

13:28.253 --> 13:30.128
when we can teleport?

Set all the traps you want,

Kraven the Hunter
does not only set traps,

13:47.232 --> 13:48.824
he is a trap.

You are only small game,

this obsession with me, Kraven.

the number one villain spot in my heart.

to run away from its predator.

looking now?

You were right, we needed
to fight for our home.

14:56.177 --> 14:59.239
Nah, what we needed was
your leadership, Punk.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.356
This makes up
for the cake, almost.

Looks like we won!

15:07.755 --> 15:09.387
Wait, where is Ock?

15:09.433 --> 15:12.630
He wouldn't leave the battle unless
he's got some other plan up his sleeve.

15:12.791 --> 15:13.723
Yeah, but...

15:13.833 --> 15:16.098
Oh, no!
The anti-Hydra weapon!

15:16.156 --> 15:18.934
Come on! That can't
be its real name.

15:21.692 --> 15:24.208
And who do we catch with
his hand in the cookie jar?

15:24.380 --> 15:25.892
Back up now, Ock.

a delicate operation?

15:39.802 --> 15:42.434
Keep at it, this force field
can't keep us both out.

15:42.497 --> 15:44.020
It is so you, Ock,

15:44.066 --> 15:45.958
to use the Sinister Six
as a distraction

15:46.044 --> 15:47.317
to get your hands
on this weapon.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.880
My old friend Connors
is a lesser intellect,

15:49.966 --> 15:53.689

his abilities with this creation.

Get this,
Rhino wasn't the mole,

15:57.228 --> 15:59.634

the new weapon proves it.
