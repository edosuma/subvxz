02:11.506 --> 02:13.383
Competitions are hard,

02:13.466 --> 02:14.801
and you did a great job.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.010
But I fell.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.138
And you got back up.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.892
Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?

02:25.895 --> 02:26.896
[Kat] Okay.

03:01.931 --> 03:05.393
I'm sorry about how it all
went down last night, but--

03:05.476 --> 03:07.520
<i>It all went down because of you.</i>

03:07.604 --> 03:10.064
I can't believe you and Mom lied to me.

-About everything.
<i>-I'm sorry, Kat.</i> <i>It's just...</i>

03:13.568 --> 03:16.029
Mitch spent the night,
and when Mom didn't come home,

03:16.112 --> 03:19.115
he tried calling her like a million times,
and she's still not picking up.

a giant bitch to me one minute

03:24.120 --> 03:26.039

[inhales sharply] Is everything okay?

04:01.699 --> 04:04.702
Well, I'm a girl with bipolar...

04:05.495 --> 04:07.705
raised by a crazy person

04:07.789 --> 04:09.666
who ruined everything for me.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.542
All I wanna do is skate,

04:12.210 --> 04:13.753
but my partner hates me.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.589
So, yeah, everything's great.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.342
Justin doesn't hate you.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.595
He hates that you don't know
if you love him.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.682
Everything feels so real.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.769
And then when it's over, it's like...

04:31.020 --> 04:33.106
it's like someone else felt those things.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.442
Sometimes it's hard to know
what's actually real.

04:36.985 --> 04:41.656
Okay, but you obviously care about him,
so if you wanna skate,

04:42.115 --> 04:45.118
can't you just tell Justin you love him?

04:45.201 --> 04:47.870
It'll be like faking an emotional orgasm.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.915
I can't lie to him anymore.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.546
All I know for sure is that I wanna skate.

04:57.797 --> 04:58.965
I can't even do that.

I have nothing.

And my phone was on silent all night,

My kid has a thing, so I gotta go.

Oh.

-[Justin] Yeah.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.902
Hm. I can't tell.

a little tomato with feet to me.

She's a fighter, just like her mama.

to mentally ill people, but...

that kind of mess in your life.

I mean, Kat has a lot going on, but...

08:36.682 --> 08:38.976
that doesn't make her a bad person.

08:39.060 --> 08:39.936
Maybe not,

08:40.019 --> 08:41.479
but she's bad for my son.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.444
for some of my wealthier patients. Um...

13:40.528 --> 13:42.863
There's a senior lady
who's suffering from a--

13:42.947 --> 13:45.825
An inflated sense of her own importance.
[chuckles]

13:46.534 --> 13:48.828
-Hey, Kat.
-Good to see you, Dr. Parker.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.287
I mean, Ethan.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.248
-[laughs]
-[Jenn] Well,

13:52.331 --> 13:55.709
since we're both here,
we might as well be spectators together.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.753
-[Jenn] Hm?
-Yeah. I'd like that.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.172
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Ooh. Work beckons. Um...

14:01.131 --> 14:03.259
-Meet you back here in a bit?
-[Jenn] Yeah.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.681
[both laugh]

14:09.348 --> 14:10.307
He's cute.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.809
Really?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.358
[sighs]

14:19.441 --> 14:21.652
I'd better go get ready for the short.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.237
Okay. Go kill it.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.501
[Reid]
Yeah, Serena! You killed that practice!

14:37.585 --> 14:40.254
That's our friend, Serena, crushing it!
That's our friend right there.

14:41.046 --> 14:41.881
[Drew] Dude, come on!

14:41.964 --> 14:44.174
We're here to support her,
not terrify her.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.136
Sorry!

14:47.219 --> 14:50.139
My phone died, and I was in traffic
for like a hundred hours.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.557
-Ooh! Ow!
-[Carol] Oh, shit!

14:51.640 --> 14:54.059
It's the suit.
It soaks up electricity like a kite.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.061
I didn't have time to change
or do anything.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.813
You're just being a good mom to Kat.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.274
Well, not good enough, apparently,
to keep her from skating,

15:00.357 --> 15:01.442
because I just saw her.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.030
Oh, hey, honey.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.329
Well, at least Serena's happy to see me.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.538
[Mitch chuckles] Hm.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.373
I fucked up today.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.000
I'm a fuck-up.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.209
No, you're not.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.545
And I'm sorry
if I made you feel that way yesterday.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.506
You know what it did to me when...

15:25.841 --> 15:26.675
Rachel cheated.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.636
It completely screwed me up,

15:28.719 --> 15:32.264
and, well, I realized
that I shouldn't put that on you.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.185
I love you, Carol.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.938
And I do wanna move in with you.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.565
[Mitch] Hm?

15:48.489 --> 15:49.865
-[girl] Serena!
-Bethany.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.202
Did you hear that Kiara Dicenzo
has a triple axel too?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.245
Who's Kiara Dicenzo?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.163
You don't know her?

15:56.246 --> 15:57.581
Well, you will now.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.875
Hers is a little less consistent
than mine,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.919
but I heard she's fully rotated.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.629
Uh-huh.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.297
Don't be scared, though.

16:05.923 --> 16:06.966
I'm not scared.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.677
You look scared.
Maybe it's just your face.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.638
Some people have a face
that just looks a certain way.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.641
Who are you looking for?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.142
[Dr. Parker] Serena.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.063
-Hey.
-Sorry to interrupt. You...

16:21.522 --> 16:24.525
said you wanted me to take a look
at the wrist before the short today.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.611
-Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
-[Bethany sighs]

16:27.695 --> 16:28.862
I've gotta go, Bethany.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.823
Good luck with Kiara.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.119
Looked like you needed saving.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.787
-Yeah, kinda.
-[both laugh]

16:37.955 --> 16:39.873
-Here it is.
-Thank you so much for coming.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.791
Yeah.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.878
With my family
and everything else that's going on,

16:46.422 --> 16:47.840
it's so good to see you.

16:48.757 --> 16:49.925
[Dr. Parker] Of course.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.596
Do you want, uh...

16:56.390 --> 16:59.309
to go for a drive,
get out of here for a little bit?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.561
Yeah, okay.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.773
Pairs are up next, and I don't skate
for a couple more hours.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.734
Sure you won't be missed?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.153
Kat wants nothing to do with me,

17:09.236 --> 17:12.239
and I'm pretty sure my mom
is too distracted to realize I'm gone.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.282
So...

17:14.825 --> 17:15.951
[whispers] I'm all yours.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.411
[Dr. Parker] Let's hit it.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.668
[Mandy]
I cannot believe this is happening.

17:24.752 --> 17:30.132
Hey, the doctor said the surfactin
has a 90 percent chance of working, okay?

17:30.215 --> 17:33.093
But what about the other ten percent?
I mean, what happens then?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.428
It's not an option.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.972
Look, she's a fighter just like her mama.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.932
[scoffs] Stop saying that!

17:39.016 --> 17:40.726
She's a three-pound baby.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.313
If she doesn't make it, it's not because
she didn't fight hard enough.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.525
-[Mandy sighs]
-Sorry. Um...

17:49.068 --> 17:51.904
She could die
before I ever have the chance to hold her.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.281
I can't lose her too.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.243
What do you mean?

17:58.869 --> 18:01.246
"You can't lose her too."
What does that mean?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.129
James...

18:09.213 --> 18:10.798
I had another baby.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.842
A girl.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.305
I gave her up for adoption when I was 15.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.850
I never even got to hold her.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.857
Carol said that I should tell you.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.193
That you would understand.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.611
I was too young.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.782
It wasn't fair to either one of us
for me to keep her.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.120
Justin texted me earlier.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.996
He and Kat have decided to skate.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.666
You know, it's a big day for him.
I should really be there.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.667
James...

18:47.167 --> 18:49.962
The rink's only a couple of hours
from here. Call me if anything changes.

18:50.045 --> 18:50.963
James!

18:52.965 --> 18:53.966
[sobs]

18:54.675 --> 18:57.427
[cheering]

18:57.511 --> 19:01.390
[Kat] Do you think we should add an extra
double toe to the jump combination?

19:02.057 --> 19:03.016
Huh?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.185
Uh, no, no. It's fine. You'll be fine.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.314
-[Kat] What's up with Dasha?
-She mentioned some long-lost love

19:09.398 --> 19:10.649
messing with her head.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.067
That shit can be distracting.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.986
Justin, I'm sorry.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.362
It's fine. I'm kidding.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.947
You won't even look at me.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.032
[sighs]

19:19.491 --> 19:20.617
Okay. You know what?

19:20.701 --> 19:21.785
That's enough.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.789
I warned you not to make your partnership
anything more, but did you listen? No.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.126
So, lucky for you,
all great art comes from pain.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.336
So you go out there and express your pain.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.005
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.132
Okay, fine. Then go and fake it.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.218
[over PA]
<i>Welcome to the ice our last skaters</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:41.597

19:46.935 --> 19:48.604

19:48.687 --> 19:51.565
Pinecrest! Whoo!

[cheering and applause]

21:57.190 --> 21:58.191
Whoo!

22:20.047 --> 22:22.674
[over PA] <i>After the short program,</i>
<i>Davis and Baker have a total</i>

22:22.758 --> 22:24.968
<i>-of 61.35 points...</i>
-Yes!

22:25.761 --> 22:28.388
<i>-...which puts them in first place.</i>
-Oh, my God!

22:28.972 --> 22:30.849
All right! That's good.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.018
Good for you. Today's a big day.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.644
Very proud. Very proud.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.104
So get some rest,

22:36.980 --> 22:39.733
and I'll see you tomorrow
for the long program. Yes.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.652
We did it! We won! [laughs]

22:46.031 --> 22:47.866
Better get used to this
golden retriever smile

22:47.949 --> 22:49.785
because you're gonna be seeing
a lot more of it.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.787
[Justin laughs]

22:52.788 --> 22:53.997
[Jenn laughing] Ah!

22:54.081 --> 22:55.290
You killed it!

22:58.126 --> 23:01.922
And the look on Leah's face,
that will sustain me for years.

23:02.672 --> 23:03.965
Are you freaking out right now?

23:04.424 --> 23:06.385
[girls laughing] Hi, Justin!

23:07.386 --> 23:08.220
Yeah.

23:08.303 --> 23:11.973
Ethan's taking me out tonight to make up
for ditching me for some patient today.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.017
You wanna come with?
We could celebrate your win.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.854
Um... I'm just not really in the mood.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.272
Okay.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.903
[woman sniffing and sighing]

23:27.114 --> 23:27.989
Kat!

23:30.450 --> 23:31.451
Jesus.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.331
I don't have anything to say to you.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.715
What are you doing here?

23:46.299 --> 23:47.968
Shouldn't you be
with my bitch of a sister?

23:48.051 --> 23:49.261
Don't say that!

23:49.344 --> 23:52.597
It was always you two against the world.
I hate that you're fighting.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.599
I was gonna go to the hotel with them,

23:54.683 --> 23:57.436
but Mitch kept being so nice,
I couldn't handle it anymore.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.522
You were right.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.442
I'm a terrible person.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.988
I never said you were a terrible person.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.743
Technically,
I said you were a terrible mother.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.207
I really gotta go.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.961
-Wait!
-[sighs]

24:26.465 --> 24:29.009
Look, I did something
really stupid last night,

24:29.634 --> 24:34.055
and Mitch is the only person I have left,
and he thinks I'm this good person.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.602
I know I...

24:40.479 --> 24:42.647
I can't ask this of you, but if he...

24:44.441 --> 24:46.693
if he says anything,
will you say I was with you?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.612
What did you do?

24:52.407 --> 24:53.617
You're unbelievable.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.495
You just-- You never learn.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.330
Please, Kat. I love him.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.375
I'll lie for you.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.587
If you answer this question for me.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.588
Anything.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.507
How come people like us,

25:09.216 --> 25:11.384
with fucked-up brains like ours,

25:14.054 --> 25:15.472
how do we know what love is?

25:22.270 --> 25:23.438
There was a moment.

25:25.941 --> 25:26.942
A moment?

25:30.779 --> 25:31.780
[sighs]

25:34.407 --> 25:36.284
When I realized I loved Mitch.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.832
I had just come home from the hospital,
and...

25:45.126 --> 25:47.212
he was brushing his teeth
in the bathroom,

25:47.295 --> 25:49.422
and he smiled at me
through his toothpaste.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.010
Then I realized I love this man.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.263
[laughs softly]

26:00.934 --> 26:02.227
The night I left home,

26:04.479 --> 26:05.730
you told me that...

26:06.773 --> 26:08.233
people like you and I, we...

26:09.609 --> 26:11.444
we can't always trust our instincts.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.446
It's true. We can't.

26:17.784 --> 26:20.203
But we can hold onto those moments...

26:22.914 --> 26:23.832
where...

26:24.791 --> 26:27.294
things just suddenly feel right.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.423
It's just 'cause...

26:32.465 --> 26:35.552
love isn't always an emotion
for people like us.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.178
It has to be a decision.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.600
And I'm just so worried that...

26:43.143 --> 26:45.645
you're gonna spend all this time
trying to pin down this emotion,

26:45.729 --> 26:47.188
you're gonna go crazy, honey.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.321
I won't tell Mitch,

26:55.697 --> 26:56.990
but I think you should.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.869
I love him too much.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.847
I think I left my bracelet
in your hotel room last night.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.599
Ah! That's too bad.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.559
-It's mine now, actually.
-Oh, stop it!

27:24.643 --> 27:27.354
-No, I'm serious...
-[conversation continues indistinctly]

27:40.533 --> 27:41.368
Serena.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.286
[Jenn] Hey.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.829
You're here early.

27:45.288 --> 27:48.416
Yeah, I have a practice session.
Can you look at my wrist? Now.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.085
Duty calls.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.754
Good luck, Serena.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.101
Are you dating Jenn?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.313
Is that why you weren't
answering my texts last night?

28:10.939 --> 28:11.898
Serena...

28:11.981 --> 28:13.274
[sighs]

28:13.358 --> 28:14.984
We never said we were serious.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.700
You said you loved me.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.661
I thought we were having fun.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.371
All right?

28:28.373 --> 28:30.875
I clearly misjudged the situation. I...

28:31.334 --> 28:34.129
I'm thinking you're not really
mature enough to handle this.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.467
-Wait, are you breaking up with me?
-You need to keep your voice down.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.219
Stop acting like a stupid kid.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.390
-I'm not!
-Probably shouldn't tell anyone about us.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.478
Reputation is a big part
of all this, right?

28:53.898 --> 28:55.358
Wouldn't wanna ruin yours.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.823
[whispering] I won't say anything.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.620
[sobbing]

29:17.172 --> 29:18.548
[Dasha] I took your advice.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.093
I told Tatiana I want to see her.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.262
I invited her here.

29:24.345 --> 29:25.722
That's great!

29:25.805 --> 29:26.973
She said no.

29:27.974 --> 29:28.808
Oh.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.686
Was it like a hard no or--

29:31.770 --> 29:32.854
She said...

29:34.522 --> 29:38.276
it's better to live with our memories
than risk disappointment.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.906
Not everyone gets a happy ending.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.244
I'm so sorry.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.080
Are you going to be okay?

29:51.164 --> 29:52.332
Of course.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.086

-Yeah. [panting]

31:27.677 --> 31:28.511
Thank you.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.971
Told you I'd never let you fall.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.390
[laughs softly]

31:32.891 --> 31:33.725
What?

31:34.309 --> 31:37.145
You asked if I meant it
when I said I loved you.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.690
I told you I didn't know.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.734
But I do now.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.653
I love you, Justin.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.451
Fuck you.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.753
-Justin!
-No. You can't do that to me again, Kat.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.421
You can't just say that.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.505
But it's true.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.426
Okay... Remember when we were
working on our overhead lifts,

32:08.509 --> 32:11.304
and we had that huge fight
outside your suite

32:11.387 --> 32:12.889
because you were being a giant asshole.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.098
Wow, okay.

32:14.182 --> 32:18.311
And you came back on the ice,
and right before we tried the lift again,

32:18.394 --> 32:22.190
you looked at me, and you told me
that you would never let me fall.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.027
That was the moment
I fell in love with you.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.824
I've never been able to trust somebody
to not let me fall before.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.493
Except you.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.162
You know, it's the reason why...

32:36.829 --> 32:38.790
I'm not scared to skate on this rink.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.586
It's why, even when we won the short,
it didn't feel right.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.758
It's not just about the skating
anymore for me.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.433
You hurt me.

33:00.019 --> 33:00.853
I know.

33:02.605 --> 33:03.564
A lot.

33:06.734 --> 33:07.694
I know.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.781
I know you do.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.412
[sighs] Fuck.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.642
Let's go beat Leah and Gabe now, okay?

33:41.310 --> 33:42.228
Okay.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.136

34:15.219 --> 34:17.096
Get your coats on. Meet me outside.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.015
Serena! Come on. Help your sister.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.934
[Serena whines]

34:27.356 --> 34:29.108
Is Mom sick again?

34:30.693 --> 34:31.694
I don't know.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.701
It's gonna be okay.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.328
I'm here.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.086
Serena...

34:52.673 --> 34:54.717
Are you worried about your long program?

34:56.844 --> 34:59.680
You know, you shouldn't be.
I heard you did great on the short.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.557
Don't pretend like you care.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.726
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

35:05.645 --> 35:06.813
Mom was right.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.023
We shouldn't be fighting.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.193
Come on.

35:12.902 --> 35:13.986
Tell me what's wrong.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.156
Like...

35:18.866 --> 35:22.120
you think you know someone,
you trust them, care about them,

35:22.203 --> 35:24.288
but then you find out
they don't give a shit about you,

35:24.372 --> 35:26.582
and they'll just leave you
like everyone else in my life.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.417
-Serena--
-Whatever.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.462
He's just an asshole.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.551
Did something happen between you and Drew?

35:43.307 --> 35:44.600
He said he loved me,

35:45.685 --> 35:47.436
but all he really wanted was sex.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.691
You're having sex with him?

35:52.900 --> 35:54.485
[Mitch] Serena!

35:54.569 --> 35:56.154
Why aren't you warming up right now?

35:56.654 --> 35:58.823
Get off that bench and come over here!

35:59.699 --> 36:00.825
Come on!

36:02.952 --> 36:03.953
[Mitch] Hm?

36:14.088 --> 36:15.464
Which one of you is Drew?

36:16.424 --> 36:20.553
-I hear you're sleeping with my sister.
-I wish I was sleeping with Serena.

36:21.470 --> 36:24.515
Sorry. What I mean
is she friend-zoned me pretty quick.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.643
She doesn't even like Reid.
Like, as a person.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.728
She really doesn't.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.897
I don't understand.
She told me she's dating you.

36:31.355 --> 36:34.192
Really?
Well, she's got a pretty weird idea

36:34.275 --> 36:35.943
of what dating means.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.530
[Reid] You asked her to go fishing.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.032
Nine times.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.325
She didn't answer me once.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.410
Fine. Whatever.

36:45.036 --> 36:45.870
Sorry.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.998
[Jenn] Hey. Are you okay?

36:49.081 --> 36:51.000
Something's going on with Serena.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.168
Of course there is.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.629
And I thought you didn't care anymore.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.172
Don't you skate in like 20 minutes?

36:56.255 --> 37:00.092
Yeah, but I'm not gonna be able to focus
if I can't find out what's going on.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.011
Damn it, Serena!

37:09.977 --> 37:10.895
Dad?

37:12.146 --> 37:13.773
Oh, hey! There he is.

37:13.856 --> 37:16.525
-What are you doing here?
-I thought I'd come and wish you luck.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.611
Not that you need luck.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.821
I mean, you know, I'm proud of you, son.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.574
You earned this. You work hard.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.702
How are you feeling? Good? Good.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.579
You okay there?

37:28.996 --> 37:31.832
Yeah. You know,
wanted to come and watch my son skate.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.628
I know you like when I win, but not sure
you ever loved watching me skate.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.171
Mandy had a baby.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.339
Years ago.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.510
I didn't know.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.179
[Justin sighs]

37:46.097 --> 37:46.973
[Justin] Wow.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.101
Yeah.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.435
And she told Carol.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.397
The woman's a train wreck,

37:54.480 --> 37:56.023
and she thought to herself,

37:56.107 --> 37:58.401
I won't tell my husband,
but I'll tell Carol.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.903
I mean, am I really that hard
to confide in?

38:02.530 --> 38:03.364
Yes.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.826
Sometimes you have to forgive
the rest of the world

38:06.909 --> 38:08.494
for not being so perfect.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.578
It's not that.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.832
I just wish she would've told me.
That's all.

38:14.792 --> 38:15.626
She did.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.004
Maybe not when you wanted her to, but...

38:19.255 --> 38:21.590
you can't fault someone
for being complicated.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.218
It's probably what made you love her.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.932
You should probably get back
to the hospital.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.852
You can watch me and Kat
skate at Nationals.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.312
Okay.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.439
Good luck.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.149
Don't need it.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.201
[Kat] Come on.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.287
So, Serena's having sex.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.290
It's not a crime. She's 16.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.042
Yeah, I know, but she lied to me.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.461
[Kat] And she was really upset.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.255
I know I can't always trust my instincts,
but something's not right.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.214
I know it.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.674
What are you doing?

39:03.758 --> 39:07.094
Serena basically transcribes
her whole life into this phone.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.555

39:16.020 --> 39:17.063
Whoa!

39:17.146 --> 39:19.982
Why is she sending
naked pictures of herself to some guy?

39:21.567 --> 39:24.403
She wrote, "Did the last four months
mean nothing to you?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.405
Did the other night mean nothing to you?"

39:28.115 --> 39:30.576
Mitch has been coaching her
for four months exactly.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.454
When would your mom leave her alone
with him overnight?

39:34.246 --> 39:35.122
She did.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.250
Two nights ago, when she was...

39:39.377 --> 39:40.419
Oh, fuck!

39:40.503 --> 39:41.712
Should we call the police?

39:42.296 --> 39:44.048
I gotta be more careful this time.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.716
I can't do anything until I have proof,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.009
like actual proof.

39:47.885 --> 39:48.886
I'm gonna call him.

He must have another phone.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.111

Your sister thinks something's wrong.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.643
Is there?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.562
Is someone hurting you?

44:09.229 --> 44:10.064
Serena.

44:12.983 --> 44:16.195
[sobbing]

44:17.863 --> 44:19.615
Ssh.

44:20.574 --> 44:23.285
<i>This customer has not enabled voicemail.</i>

44:23.369 --> 44:25.204
[Justin] There you are.
Why aren't you ready?

44:25.287 --> 44:27.289
They're almost finished,
and we're second up.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.584
I'm sorry. I know.
I'm just dealing with some family stuff.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.920
I'll get changed,
and I'll come meet you by the rink, okay?

44:33.003 --> 44:34.046
I love you.

44:39.802 --> 44:40.803
[sighs]

44:42.346 --> 44:45.432
[cell phone buzzing]

44:57.319 --> 44:58.153
[Kat] Hey!

44:59.154 --> 45:00.656
I know about you and Serena.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.741
I've seen all of it.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.284
The texts, the photos.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.495
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about.

45:06.578 --> 45:07.705
Yes, you fucking do.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.957
And I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.792
-She's 16!
-All right.

45:14.128 --> 45:14.962
Yes...

45:15.587 --> 45:16.922
your sister texted me.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.049
I didn't know what to do. I...

45:19.133 --> 45:20.259
I felt sorry for her.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.469
Seemed like a pretty lonely kid,
so I texted her back.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.681
If you look at the messages,
you'll see I barely answered her,

45:25.764 --> 45:26.974
but she was obsessed.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.101
She started thinking
we were in a relationship.

45:29.184 --> 45:32.730
This is just a case of a delusional
teenage girl with a crush.

45:32.813 --> 45:33.814
No.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.190
I don't believe you.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.608
[Jenn] Hey.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.360
[Jenn] What's up?

45:42.114 --> 45:43.657
Why's everyone so serious?

45:46.660 --> 45:48.746
Did you figure out
what was going on with your sister?

45:49.913 --> 45:50.789
Yeah.

45:55.252 --> 45:57.045
Oh, come on. You can't believe that shit.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.922
Jenn, it's okay.
It's just a misunderstanding.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.632
[Dr. Parker] It's not worth getting upset.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.926
This is bullshit.
First Drew, then Mitch, now you?

46:03.010 --> 46:05.721
Why would Serena lie about this?
It's right here.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.473
She's <i>your </i>sister, isn't she?

46:08.974 --> 46:09.933
She must be lying.

46:10.517 --> 46:11.727
-Jenn!
-[Jenn] What?

46:11.810 --> 46:13.687
You lied to me for years about everything.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.439
You know why I did that.

46:15.522 --> 46:17.024
[Jenn] Yeah, I do.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.318
Because you're crazy,
and so is your entire family.

46:19.401 --> 46:22.571
And I'm not gonna let your crazy
fuck up my happiness. Not again!

46:26.158 --> 46:27.117
Ethan,

46:27.743 --> 46:29.077
I think we should go.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.037
[Kat] No.

46:31.997 --> 46:32.831
Jenn!

46:32.915 --> 46:34.500
[Kat] You can't just walk away.

46:53.602 --> 46:54.603
[James] Hey.

46:58.816 --> 46:59.817
You were right.

47:00.692 --> 47:02.069
Life is complicated.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.529
I'm so sorry.

47:04.488 --> 47:07.699
I was just hurt that you didn't think
you could tell me.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.911
I'm just a jackass sometimes.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.249
-I love you.
-I love you too.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.127
[Serena sobbing]

47:26.009 --> 47:27.135
Serena.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.848
How did this happen?

47:34.017 --> 47:35.477
He was nice to me.

47:37.396 --> 47:40.357
At the hospital,
when I sprained my wrist after Mom...

47:44.069 --> 47:45.904
[Serena] Then you moved out,

47:45.988 --> 47:47.698
and Mom was with Mitch,

47:49.700 --> 47:51.493
and my dad left.

47:52.160 --> 47:55.622
There was no one else,
and he said he cared about me.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.253
I'm calling the police.

48:02.254 --> 48:03.171
No.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.132
No, you're not.

48:06.675 --> 48:07.968
You're going to skate.

48:09.469 --> 48:10.637
Are you kidding?

48:11.388 --> 48:12.806
[Carol] I'll deal with this.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.977
I should never have left home.

48:17.477 --> 48:19.271
[Carol] No, this is not on you.

48:19.354 --> 48:21.732
You were right.
You knew something was wrong,

48:21.815 --> 48:24.902
and instead of listening
to your instincts, I made you feel crazy.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.821
Okay, I'm her mother.
This is my responsibility.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.455
We are going to get through this.
Do you understand me?

48:36.538 --> 48:39.750
Because the only other option
is to quit, and we don't do that.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.084
Not in this family.

48:43.211 --> 48:46.173
Look, I know life has thrown
the three of us some real shit.

48:48.175 --> 48:49.384
We're gonna be okay.

48:50.677 --> 48:51.845
Mom's right, Kat.

48:53.972 --> 48:55.140
You need to skate.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.896
After everything that's happened,
we need this.

49:02.856 --> 49:04.066
Something good.

49:14.242 --> 49:16.119
[upbeat music playing]

49:20.874 --> 49:22.459
