02:28.962 --> 02:31.589
<i>As the 19th century began,</i>

02:31.714 --> 02:34.842
<i>a darkening shadow
moved across Europe.</i>

02:34.968 --> 02:38.846
<i>This shadow was propelled
by the voice of one man,</i>

02:38.972 --> 02:40.723
<i>Napoleon Bonaparte.</i>

02:40.848 --> 02:44.769
<i>Only Russia and England
offered impressive resistance.</i>

02:44.894 --> 02:48.898
<i>Over Russia, the weather was clear,
the sun was shining.</i>

02:49.023 --> 02:51.526
<i>Napoleon was 1,000 miles away,</i>

02:51.651 --> 02:55.864
<i>and the streets of Moscow
were excellent for parades.</i>

03:32.567 --> 03:36.738
Splendid sights,
splendid men, eh, Pierre?

03:36.863 --> 03:40.533
- For parades.
- What do you mean by that?

03:40.658 --> 03:43.703
Remember, I've seen
the French marching, too.

03:43.828 --> 03:47.624
Don't tell me
they march better than that.

03:50.043 --> 03:53.922
- Led by the greatest man in Europe.
- Bonaparte?

03:54.047 --> 03:55.882
Bonaparte.

03:56.007 --> 03:59.552
A usurper! A murderer!
A deposer of kings!

03:59.677 --> 04:04.057
A colossus!
A fresh wind! A cleansing force!

04:04.849 --> 04:08.269
What does your father say
when he hears you?

04:08.394 --> 04:12.398
We don't talk about things like that,
my father and I.

04:12.524 --> 04:17.654
- How is he?
- The doctors say he'll die any moment.

04:17.779 --> 04:21.950
- Have you been to see him?
- I'm waiting to be asked.

04:22.075 --> 04:25.203
In heaven, all things will be arranged.

04:26.037 --> 04:28.373
I believe that's the rumor.

04:28.498 --> 04:31.834
This is your home
when you want it to be,

04:31.960 --> 04:37.215
and the Rostovs are your family
when you want them to be.

04:38.049 --> 04:40.176
I smoke too much.

04:44.305 --> 04:48.059
Isn't it lovely? How can you bear
not to go with them?

04:48.184 --> 04:49.894
I can bear it.

04:50.019 --> 04:54.816
If I were a man, I'd be down there,
riding a terrible black horse,

04:54.941 --> 04:56.651
waving a sword.

05:01.155 --> 05:03.032
It's so unfair.

05:03.157 --> 05:07.370
Men are the only people
permitted to have any fun.

05:24.429 --> 05:26.556
What is it, Natasha?

05:28.391 --> 05:32.520
Those handsome young men
marching away to fight.

05:32.645 --> 05:35.815
They could be killed.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.672
Don't be frightened. Come on.

06:02.634 --> 06:04.761
Nicholas!

06:07.764 --> 06:10.600
Now, what's this?

06:11.935 --> 06:15.271
You look so dazzling in your uniform.

06:15.396 --> 06:17.899
And you're going so far away.

06:18.024 --> 06:22.153
Austria's miles,
I looked it up on the map.

06:22.278 --> 06:24.489
That brute, Napoleon.

06:24.614 --> 06:28.284
The Austrians make beautiful
bracelets. I'll bring you one.

06:28.409 --> 06:33.039
- Two! They're wearing them in pairs!
- Two.

06:33.164 --> 06:36.960
Pierre, you remember our cousin,
Sonya. She's come to stay.

06:37.085 --> 06:41.214
Yes, though she was considerably
younger the last time I saw her.

06:41.339 --> 06:45.969
Girls grow up, Pierre. Very fast.
Doesn't he look glorious?

06:46.094 --> 06:50.056
Mama and Papa have
such handsome children!

06:50.181 --> 06:52.350
Did you hear that?

06:52.475 --> 06:54.644
Now, attention!

06:54.769 --> 06:59.232
Ensign Count Nicholas Rostov,
I decorate you with the Order of...

06:59.357 --> 07:01.734
...Absolutely Everything!

07:03.778 --> 07:06.865
Don't laugh when she jokes
about the army.

07:06.990 --> 07:11.035
Well, Petya,
you have to humour women a little!

07:11.160 --> 07:14.914
You do look shiny, Nicholas.
If only I was old enough.

07:15.039 --> 07:16.541
That'll come.

07:16.666 --> 07:20.795
By that time, there won't be
a Frenchman left to be killed!

07:20.920 --> 07:24.173
Don't worry, there'll always be
plenty of Frenchmen.

07:24.299 --> 07:28.511
- Good luck.
- That's very civil of you.

07:28.636 --> 07:32.849
- But why not take a commission?
- It's so easy for you men.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.685
You decide to do something, then do it.

07:35.810 --> 07:39.105
If you were a man, what would you do?

07:39.230 --> 07:41.524
I'd become enormously powerful.

07:41.649 --> 07:46.237
I'd become the Czar's most trusted
minister, and he'd consult me.

07:46.362 --> 07:49.115
And you would sit at my right hand.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.327
Whenever anything was complicated,

07:52.452 --> 07:55.622
the case would be laid before you
as judge.

07:55.747 --> 07:58.124
Why me?

07:58.249 --> 08:02.670
Because your heart is pure
and you're good.

08:02.795 --> 08:05.173
Well done, my dear.

08:05.298 --> 08:08.176
On that note, I think I should leave.

08:08.301 --> 08:11.512
If you had that power,
what would you do?

08:11.638 --> 08:13.139
I?

08:15.934 --> 08:19.187
I would hesitate. Now I must go.

08:19.312 --> 08:23.566
- Pierre, come again soon.
- I'll walk you to the door.

08:23.691 --> 08:27.070
- "Au revoir."
- Come soon again.

08:27.612 --> 08:29.489
Come again soon.

08:29.614 --> 08:33.534
Mama and Papa will be awfully
lonely with Nicholas gone.

08:33.659 --> 08:38.623
- They do love seeing you.
- Of course. I love the whole family.

08:38.748 --> 08:42.876
The whole family?
That's not as simple as you think.

08:43.001 --> 08:44.879
What do you mean?

08:45.004 --> 08:48.174
There are currents and counter-currents.

08:51.886 --> 08:53.596
Au revoir.

08:54.430 --> 08:58.351
Now, where are you going?
Dolokhov's rooms?

08:58.476 --> 09:00.603
I am. How did you know?

09:00.728 --> 09:03.898
I hear things, I hear things.

09:06.359 --> 09:11.614
Go. Go to your night of disgusting,
fascinating debauchery.

09:13.992 --> 09:15.702
Au revoir.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.816
Bravo! Bravo!

10:33.821 --> 10:37.825
- Careful, there's a bet on here.
- Fetch me a bottle of rum!

10:37.951 --> 10:40.662
You two, break this out.

10:40.787 --> 10:43.164
Now, let's get this straight.

10:43.289 --> 10:46.084
Fifty imperials against Prince Anatole

10:46.209 --> 10:49.963
that I drink a bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth,

10:50.088 --> 10:55.510
balancing on the outside ledge
without touching the sides of the window.

10:55.635 --> 10:59.931
- Want to make it a hundred?
- Fifty is enough for you to lose.

11:00.056 --> 11:02.684
Get down from there, you weaklings.

11:02.809 --> 11:05.061
- Hercules, come on!
- Come on!

11:05.186 --> 11:07.313
You do it!

11:37.760 --> 11:39.470
Hail Moscow!

11:40.054 --> 11:41.681
Give me that!

11:41.806 --> 11:44.684
Don't be crazy, you'll be killed.

11:46.060 --> 11:49.689
Touch me again,
I'll throw you down there.

11:49.814 --> 11:52.192
That goes for every one of you.

11:52.317 --> 11:55.904
Play! Play!
What are we paying you for?

11:59.908 --> 12:01.618
Now then, my friends.

12:01.743 --> 12:05.496
Remember, without taking the bottle
from your lips.

12:48.498 --> 12:50.917
Bravo!

12:53.503 --> 12:55.505
Fifty imperials, Anatole!

12:55.630 --> 12:59.634
And double for anyone else
who will do it.

12:59.759 --> 13:03.972
I'll do it for nothing, without a bet!

13:07.767 --> 13:11.771
- You get dizzy walking up steps!
- Out of my way!

13:18.987 --> 13:21.114
Give me a bottle!

13:30.874 --> 13:33.626
Get down from there.

13:33.751 --> 13:38.298
- Get down from there, Pierre.
- Let him do it.

13:38.423 --> 13:41.593
Your father is calling for you.

13:42.969 --> 13:45.096
Excuse me, gentlemen.

13:47.140 --> 13:50.351
I suggest a little cold water first.

13:50.476 --> 13:53.062
I'll wait for you.

13:53.187 --> 13:57.066
Prince Andrei,
is the old boy really dying?

13:57.192 --> 14:01.404
The doctors are certain
Count Bezukhov won't last the night.

14:03.114 --> 14:07.452
- Are my father and sister there?
- He was there. She was expected.

14:07.577 --> 14:12.373
That's good. I don't have to go.
The family's well represented.

14:19.130 --> 14:22.050
Careful, careful.

14:22.175 --> 14:27.680
You disapprove of me? Of course.
You'd be wrong if you didn't.

14:27.805 --> 14:33.394
Arriving at the deathbed of my father
bleary-eyed, stinking of alcohol.

14:33.519 --> 14:36.773
He disapproves, too, my father.

14:36.898 --> 14:41.903
That's fair enough. I disapprove
of many things about him.

14:42.028 --> 14:46.658
Chiefly, I disapprove of the fact
that he didn't marry my mother.

14:46.783 --> 14:50.328
Perhaps, if I was legitimate...

14:50.453 --> 14:55.959
I have sinned, Lord,
but I have several excellent excuses.

14:56.084 --> 14:59.546
With all that, Andrei,
you still disapprove?

14:59.671 --> 15:02.382
You're not being worthy of yourself.

15:02.507 --> 15:07.095
You're not living up to the best things
in yourself. Be somebody!

15:07.220 --> 15:11.683
That's where the puzzle begins,
be somebody. Be what? Who am I?

15:11.808 --> 15:15.728
Am I the next Count Bezukhov,
lord of vast estates,

15:15.853 --> 15:19.482
with a fixed position,
fixed responsibilities?

15:19.607 --> 15:21.150
Not quite!

15:21.276 --> 15:25.321
My father cannot quite acknowledge
that I am his son.

15:25.446 --> 15:29.492
But he cannot quite acknowledge
that I am not his son.

15:29.617 --> 15:32.287
That makes everybody uncomfortable,
including myself.

15:32.412 --> 15:38.293
- You must aim at something.
- You're right, I agree with you.

15:38.418 --> 15:42.005
Each morning I wake up,
I'm disgusted with myself

15:42.130 --> 15:44.799
with what I did the night before.

15:44.924 --> 15:48.428
I tell myself, "Today, a change."

15:48.553 --> 15:51.890
If my headache is bad enough,
I say, "Pierre...

15:52.015 --> 15:55.935
"...today you must take steps
to become a saint."

15:56.060 --> 15:59.355
I drop into the club
and watch the card-playing,

15:59.480 --> 16:06.112
just order a glass of water to prove
how marvelously I resist temptation.

16:06.237 --> 16:11.451
Then someone comes along
and says, "Just one vodka, Pierre."

16:11.576 --> 16:15.747
Next morning, my headache is worse,
my pockets are emptier.

16:15.872 --> 16:18.708
There must be
something you want to do.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.628
I want to discover... everything!

16:22.754 --> 16:27.592
I want to discover why I know
what's right and still do what's wrong.

16:27.717 --> 16:33.139
I want to discover what happiness is,
and what value there is in suffering.

16:33.264 --> 16:36.392
I want to discover why men go to war,

16:36.517 --> 16:42.649
and what they really say
deep in their hearts when they pray.

16:42.774 --> 16:48.321
I want to discover what men and
women feel when they say they love.

16:48.446 --> 16:51.616
There's enough to keep me busy.

16:53.785 --> 16:56.829
It's hard to understand someone like me.

16:56.955 --> 16:59.249
Everything is so clear for you.

16:59.374 --> 17:03.086
- You know exactly what you must do.
- Oh, exactly!

17:03.211 --> 17:06.381
You're different from me.
You study, you become enlightened.

17:06.506 --> 17:09.800
I study, I become confused.

17:09.925 --> 17:14.888
You love, you marry. You believe,
you act. There's a war, you serve.

17:15.013 --> 17:18.184
If only I really answered
to your description.

17:18.309 --> 17:21.479
- You do.
- Shall I show you how wrong you are?

17:21.604 --> 17:26.276
- I know you. I'm not wrong.
- Know why I'm going to the war?

17:26.401 --> 17:29.153
Because I regard Napoleon
as a monster?

17:29.279 --> 17:34.033
Because I believe we should fight
Austria's battles 2,000 miles away?

17:34.158 --> 17:37.912
Because Russia will be
a greater nation after the war?

17:38.037 --> 17:39.455
Then, why?

17:39.581 --> 17:44.627
Because I married the most loving
and attractive woman in Moscow,

17:44.752 --> 17:47.797
and I can't stand it.

17:47.922 --> 17:49.799
Never marry, Pierre.

17:49.924 --> 17:53.303
Or only when you're old
and good for nothing,

17:53.428 --> 17:56.514
or else everything noble in you
will be lost.

17:56.639 --> 17:59.601
You'll waste yourself on trifles.

17:59.726 --> 18:03.021
Yes. Don't look at me like that.

18:03.146 --> 18:05.440
You talk of Bonaparte's career.

18:05.565 --> 18:07.567
If Bonaparte had married young,

18:07.692 --> 18:12.655
he'd still be on half-pay,
carrying his wife's handbag,

18:12.780 --> 18:18.036
inviting idiots to his house because
his wife wanted invitations to theirs!

19:21.015 --> 19:24.602
- Prince Andrei.
- Princess Hélene.

19:24.727 --> 19:27.063
You told my brother he was expected?

19:27.188 --> 19:29.357
- I did.
- Isn't he coming?

19:29.482 --> 19:31.609
I believe not.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.487
Thank you.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.671
How is he, Prince Vasili?

19:51.796 --> 19:57.677
His confessor is with him.
They are giving him extreme unction.

19:57.802 --> 20:00.597
He was asking for you.

20:00.722 --> 20:05.768
I hope you are in a proper condition
to see him this time.

20:07.061 --> 20:08.980
Follow me.

20:09.105 --> 20:12.442
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

21:07.330 --> 21:10.291
If you please, Monsieur Pierre.

21:11.793 --> 21:15.547
He wishes you to kiss him goodbye.

21:44.617 --> 21:46.911
This is for you.

21:54.502 --> 21:57.755
Now he would like to sleep.

22:21.154 --> 22:23.281
Pierre...

22:24.532 --> 22:27.911
So late.
Finally, at the end, he loved me.

22:28.036 --> 22:30.538
So late.

22:30.663 --> 22:32.790
He gave me this.

22:38.129 --> 22:40.924
This letter is for the Czar.

22:41.049 --> 22:45.053
- And this one for you, Pierre.
- Open it.

22:54.562 --> 22:57.357
"Your father, in his letter to the Czar,

22:57.482 --> 23:01.694
"he begs that you be legitimately
acknowledged as his son

23:01.819 --> 23:07.534
"and the next Count Bezukhov,
the sole heir to all his estates."

23:17.585 --> 23:20.129
Be worthy, my boy.

23:20.255 --> 23:23.341
Be worthy of your great father.

23:23.466 --> 23:27.971
How often we sin.
How much we deceive, and for what?

23:28.096 --> 23:30.723
It all ends in death.

23:30.848 --> 23:35.061
Kiss your cousin, Hélene,
he has been reborn.

23:35.186 --> 23:38.731
Embrace him. Wish him well.

24:03.214 --> 24:05.925
It's a good thing
we're going back to Moscow.

24:06.050 --> 24:10.305
After three weeks in the country,
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

24:10.430 --> 24:16.144
Still, it was a profitable trip,
wasn't it, Pierre?

24:17.937 --> 24:19.772
Very profitable.

24:44.964 --> 24:47.175
I'll see how long we have to wait.

24:47.300 --> 24:52.263
There's no hurry. It'll give Papa
a few extra winks of sleep.

24:57.518 --> 24:59.229
Andrei!

25:00.522 --> 25:02.232
Pierre!

25:05.443 --> 25:09.656
- Where are you going? Your father's?
- Yes. Tell me your news.

25:09.781 --> 25:13.618
- Are you alone?
- No. Prince Vasili is with me.

25:13.743 --> 25:15.787
And his daughter, too.

25:15.912 --> 25:21.918
We made a tour of inspection of
my estates. It's huge and backward.

25:22.043 --> 25:25.296
Now I'm Count Bezukhov,
I must do something about it.

25:25.421 --> 25:28.508
That's why you went
with Prince Vasili and Hélene.

25:28.633 --> 25:31.594
Prince Vasili helps me
with the administration.

25:31.719 --> 25:33.137
Of course.

25:33.263 --> 25:35.056
Say hello to Lise.

25:35.181 --> 25:38.101
She's miserable at being
stuck in the country.

25:38.226 --> 25:41.563
Hélene loves the country.
It was her idea to come.

25:41.688 --> 25:43.815
I'm sure.

25:44.607 --> 25:48.194
- Children, go away!
- How long are you here?

25:48.319 --> 25:51.865
For ever.
Months and months and months!

25:51.990 --> 25:55.702
Until after the baby is born.
No, thank you.

25:55.827 --> 25:57.996
Andrei's leaving tomorrow.

25:58.121 --> 26:02.125
He thought it'd be better for me here
than alone in Moscow.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.711
How do you feel about it?

26:04.836 --> 26:06.713
I dread it.

26:06.838 --> 26:10.216
Even so, you consented
to bury yourself down here?

26:10.341 --> 26:13.177
Andrei wants me to.

26:13.303 --> 26:16.973
If it were I,
I'd find something else to do.

26:17.098 --> 26:20.435
I suppose so.
But we're very different.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.312
Indeed we are.

26:22.812 --> 26:26.107
- Have you asked her to marry you?
- No.

26:26.232 --> 26:29.068
Are you going to?

26:29.194 --> 26:31.738
I don't know yet.

26:31.863 --> 26:37.118
- Do you want some advice?
- On any subject. Not on this.

26:38.077 --> 26:39.787
All right.

26:48.630 --> 26:51.007
Andrei! Lise!

26:57.263 --> 27:01.726
We thought you'd never come.
Lise, you look so beautiful.

27:01.851 --> 27:05.605
- You, too, Mary.
- No, I'm just a country mouse.

27:05.730 --> 27:10.527
It isn't true what you wrote,
that you're only staying overnight?

27:10.652 --> 27:15.823
- I'm afraid it is.
- Lise, talk to him. Make him stay.

27:15.949 --> 27:20.578
- I've tried.
- Lise's very tired. She'd better rest.

27:20.703 --> 27:24.832
- Yes?
- Your father would like to see you.

27:24.958 --> 27:28.127
Thank you.
You'd better go upstairs, Lise.

27:28.253 --> 27:30.630
You'll see him at dinner.

27:30.755 --> 27:32.173
Come!

27:39.222 --> 27:41.099
Here's the warrior!

27:41.224 --> 27:46.229
Here's the Bolkonsky
that's going to beat Napoleon.

27:46.354 --> 27:49.315
How are you, my boy?

27:49.941 --> 27:52.652
I'm well, Father. How is your health?

27:52.777 --> 27:56.489
The same, boy, the same.
Only fools fall ill.

27:56.614 --> 27:59.909
You know me,
busy from morning till night.

28:00.034 --> 28:02.579
Little to eat, less to drink,
of course I'm well.

28:02.704 --> 28:06.833
- Thank God.
- God has nothing to do with it.

28:15.091 --> 28:17.135
Just a moment, please.

28:17.260 --> 28:21.222
- Don't refuse.
- What is it?

28:21.347 --> 28:26.561
Father's father used to take it
along with him... in all his wars.

28:26.686 --> 28:30.815
If it's not too heavy
and won't break my neck.

28:30.940 --> 28:34.319
Promise that you'll never take it off.

28:34.444 --> 28:36.571
- Promise?
- Yes.

28:42.493 --> 28:44.621
Kiss me here.

28:53.463 --> 28:56.216
Thank you, my boy.

28:56.341 --> 29:00.678
- Why do you thank me, Father?
- For doing your duty.

29:00.803 --> 29:05.350
For not allowing yourself
to be tied to a woman's apron strings.

29:05.475 --> 29:09.687
The army before everything.
Thank you, thank you.

29:12.273 --> 29:14.859
About my wife, Father...

29:14.984 --> 29:18.029
Your wife? Go on, speak.

29:18.154 --> 29:21.908
When her confinement is due,
send to Moscow for a doctor.

29:22.033 --> 29:25.495
- A doctor?
- No one can do nature's work.

29:25.620 --> 29:29.707
But they've been telling her things
and she's had a dream.

29:29.832 --> 29:32.293
She's frightened.

29:32.418 --> 29:35.171
All right, all right.

29:35.296 --> 29:38.049
Give this to Michael Kutuzov.

29:38.174 --> 29:40.385
We were at school together.

29:40.510 --> 29:44.597
He wasn't exactly a bright lad,
but never mind.

29:44.722 --> 29:48.726
I've written to tell him
to keep you away from headquarters.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.979
They're bad places.

29:51.980 --> 29:55.233
Tell him I remember him
and admire him.

29:55.358 --> 29:57.485
Now, goodbye.

30:03.950 --> 30:06.619
Remember this, Prince Andrei.

30:06.744 --> 30:11.207
If they kill you,
it will hurt me, your old father.

30:11.332 --> 30:16.296
But, if you don't behave like the son
of Nicholas Bolkonsky, it will be worse.

30:16.421 --> 30:19.007
I shall be shamed.

30:19.883 --> 30:22.886
You needn't have said that to me, Father.

30:23.011 --> 30:27.390
I... also wanted to ask you,

30:27.515 --> 30:31.144
if I am killed and I have a son,

30:31.269 --> 30:34.689
don't let him be taken away from you.

30:34.814 --> 30:37.358
Let him grow up here.

30:38.484 --> 30:40.695
With you. Please.

30:45.867 --> 30:49.871
What are you waiting for?
We've said goodbye. Go! Go!

30:58.755 --> 31:01.966
Andrei, you're leaving already?

31:02.091 --> 31:06.679
Don't go, don't leave me here.
I'll be so lonely.

31:06.804 --> 31:09.807
I'll leave you here
with my father and Mary.

31:09.933 --> 31:12.227
Stay until tomorrow.
Stay another day.

31:12.352 --> 31:15.647
I can't, Lise, you know that!

31:15.772 --> 31:20.276
You're delighted to go.
You're delighted to get rid of me!

31:20.985 --> 31:23.821
Andrei, Andrei...

31:37.126 --> 31:39.254
Bye, Mary.

31:44.259 --> 31:46.553
Katya, get some smelling salts.

31:55.979 --> 32:00.733
Tell the silly horse to stop shaking
its head. I'll never get it.

32:00.859 --> 32:04.863
You heard the lady,
stop shaking your head.

32:06.364 --> 32:10.577
You see? Animals are much
more reasonable than people.

32:17.667 --> 32:22.380
Might I offer you a million roubles
to paint my portrait?

32:23.673 --> 32:28.928
But you must make me
look at least as good as the horse!

32:29.053 --> 32:32.599
It's not fair to look at it
before it's finished.

32:32.724 --> 32:36.394
- Very unpromising, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.564
You needn't be
in such a hurry to agree.

32:39.689 --> 32:46.070
It's not meant to be a work of art.
Papa bought the colt for Nicholas.

32:46.196 --> 32:49.824
I'll send him the picture
to show him what it's like.

32:49.949 --> 32:54.329
- Have you finished?
- For the moment.

32:56.497 --> 32:59.459
Charge! Come on! Hurry!

33:02.170 --> 33:04.422
Come on! Come on!

33:06.674 --> 33:11.346
- Have you heard from Nicholas?
- Papa received a letter. Not me.

33:11.471 --> 33:14.265
Men forget about women when at war.

33:14.390 --> 33:18.937
- Men don't, boys do.
- Nicholas would be furious at that!

33:19.062 --> 33:23.483
- He'd challenge you to a duel.
- It's a better reason than most.

33:23.608 --> 33:26.486
The reason he wrote
was for more money.

33:26.611 --> 33:30.657
He lends money to his captain
who loses it at cards.

33:30.782 --> 33:33.493
The captain sounds a lot like Papa.

33:33.618 --> 33:37.497
His name's Denisov.
He's got mustaches out to here.

33:37.622 --> 33:40.708
He lisps and he's the bravest man
in the world.

33:40.833 --> 33:43.336
Nicholas says
he's having a glorious time,

33:43.461 --> 33:45.547
and we'll win the war soon.

33:45.672 --> 33:49.842
He's beginning to feel quite sorry
for Napoleon.

33:49.968 --> 33:53.346
Kill them! Come on, men!

33:53.471 --> 33:57.809
Take that! Come on, charge!

33:59.394 --> 34:02.897
There's no doubt,
wars must be very amusing.

34:03.022 --> 34:06.025
- I must put it on my list.
- What list?

34:06.150 --> 34:10.362
My list of the greatest human
pleasures in order of importance.

34:10.487 --> 34:14.659
- I'd neglected war.
- What are the other pleasures?

34:14.784 --> 34:18.746
The opera, eternal friendship,
summertime, dancing the mazurka,

34:18.871 --> 34:22.083
the country in spring
and welcoming soldiers home.

34:22.208 --> 34:25.962
- Have you any suggestions?
- Let me think.

34:26.087 --> 34:28.755
To be able to believe in God,

34:28.882 --> 34:31.175
to cause happiness, to love.

34:31.301 --> 34:34.262
Love! Sonya's in love with Nicholas.

34:34.387 --> 34:38.181
She cries every day in the morning
for a full hour.

34:38.308 --> 34:42.353
- Don't you intend to fall in love?
- Many times but only for recreation.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.065
And I'll keep changing partners
like a dance.

34:46.190 --> 34:49.819
When I finally say,
"I love you," and mean it,

34:49.944 --> 34:52.572
it'll be like a defeated general,

34:52.697 --> 34:56.074
surrendering and handing his sword
to his enemy.

34:56.201 --> 34:57.660
You'll change.

34:57.785 --> 35:03.875
When you're young, everybody's
always telling you you'll change.

35:05.627 --> 35:10.423
- Are you dining with us tonight?
- I have a previous engagement.

35:10.548 --> 35:13.551
Oh? With whom?

35:13.676 --> 35:16.221
My cousin, Princess Hélene.

35:17.555 --> 35:22.101
Oh. I'd like to be like her
when I grow up.

35:22.227 --> 35:24.896
I'd have to fill out around here, though.

35:25.021 --> 35:29.526
Tall, proud, beautiful, cold
and untouchable.

35:29.651 --> 35:33.196
With regiments of men
dropping at my feet.

35:34.656 --> 35:38.076
I'm going to marry her, Natasha.

35:38.910 --> 35:41.412
Gently, gently.

35:42.830 --> 35:47.210
Who's surrendering his sword,
you or she?

35:50.505 --> 35:53.716
Be happy, dearest Pierre.

35:57.178 --> 36:01.474
I order you to be supremely happy.

36:22.829 --> 36:25.999
I'll be leaving again directly. Wait.

36:35.216 --> 36:38.344
I must deliver a message
to General Kutuzov immediately.

36:38.469 --> 36:40.638
Well, I...

36:40.763 --> 36:45.268
There's the General's aide.
Talk to him, Ensign.

36:45.393 --> 36:48.271
I've just come from the picket lines.

36:48.396 --> 36:51.357
I've a message
for the Commander-in-Chief.

36:51.482 --> 36:55.236
His Excellency is in a council of war.
Give me the message.

36:55.361 --> 36:57.113
A verbal message.

36:57.238 --> 37:00.283
Deliver it to me now.

37:00.408 --> 37:05.997
My squadron is on picket duty.
We saw the French put out their fires.

37:06.122 --> 37:10.210
- The enemy's on the move, sir.
- Is that all?

37:10.335 --> 37:13.504
Is that all?

37:13.630 --> 37:18.092
I'd say you've seen no action yet,
am I right?

37:21.804 --> 37:24.599
Good luck, my friend.

37:24.724 --> 37:28.019
...it's apparent the enemy
has regrouped his position.

37:28.144 --> 37:34.400
Surely now, you should consider
changing the orders for tomorrow.

37:34.526 --> 37:39.405
Or rather for today,
for it is past midnight.

37:39.531 --> 37:41.741
Gentlemen...

37:44.869 --> 37:52.126
Gentlemen, the orders for tomorrow
cannot now be altered.

37:54.629 --> 37:59.759
You've heard them,
and we shall all do our duty.

38:01.427 --> 38:06.224
But, before a battle,
there is nothing more important...

38:07.767 --> 38:10.728
...than to have a good sleep.

38:13.481 --> 38:15.316
Goodnight.

38:15.441 --> 38:18.361
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

38:18.486 --> 38:21.447
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

38:32.125 --> 38:37.213
But, sir, if the French are
that far south of Austerlitz...

38:37.338 --> 38:39.841
Plans!

38:39.966 --> 38:45.221
After the battle, they'll have a hundred
reasons why the plans didn't work.

38:45.346 --> 38:48.057
They'll blame everything
but themselves.

38:48.808 --> 38:51.978
How do you think it will go tomorrow?

38:54.272 --> 38:57.442
I think the battle will be lost.

39:01.738 --> 39:07.118
We shall not have lost the war,
Andrei, because of this one battle.

39:07.243 --> 39:09.370
There will be a peace...

39:10.997 --> 39:13.166
...and then a new war.

39:13.291 --> 39:16.044
Men like Napoleon can never stop

39:16.169 --> 39:19.339
till their own ambition destroys them.

39:22.008 --> 39:25.470
The only important battle is the last.

39:25.595 --> 39:27.722
Goodnight.

39:34.229 --> 39:35.939
Fire!

39:45.198 --> 39:49.702
Sir, it looks as if the French
have broken our flank.

39:52.705 --> 39:55.875
Captain, the Hussars must charge.

40:48.678 --> 40:52.891
- You're wounded.
- The wound's not here, it's there!

40:55.018 --> 40:57.145
Stop them!

40:58.021 --> 41:01.441
Stop those cowards, Bolkonsky!

41:08.323 --> 41:11.492
Forward, lads! Forward!

41:13.494 --> 41:15.079
Forward!

41:15.205 --> 41:17.957
Forward, lads! Forward!

41:46.236 --> 41:49.447
That is a fine death.

41:50.406 --> 41:52.909
Oh, he is alive!

41:54.702 --> 41:58.748
Have him attended to
and take him to my bivouac.

41:58.873 --> 42:01.834
Let my doctor examine his wounds.

42:33.199 --> 42:37.203
- So early in the morning, Pierre.
- It's 11 o'clock.

42:37.328 --> 42:42.917
- So early!
- We have a lot of shopping to do.

42:43.042 --> 42:45.503
Oh, Pierre, I'm so tired.

42:45.628 --> 42:49.841
All right, I'll go myself
and come back early.

42:53.344 --> 42:56.556
- The morning papers, sir.
- Thank you.

43:03.855 --> 43:09.736
- Anything amusing in "The Gazette?"
- No, we've lost again.

43:09.861 --> 43:13.072
An armistice is going to be discussed.

43:13.198 --> 43:17.368
Prisoners and wounded on both sides
will be immediately returned.

43:17.493 --> 43:21.247
In a word, we're suing for peace.

43:21.372 --> 43:25.460
- You sound bitter.
- Maybe I am.

43:25.585 --> 43:31.758
What difference does it make,
a piece of Poland changes hands?

43:31.883 --> 43:35.428
It's so boring
to worry about things like that!

43:35.553 --> 43:39.515
- So, no more war.
- For the time being.

43:39.641 --> 43:42.185
For the time being.

43:42.310 --> 43:45.772
- Then the armies will be coming back.
- I suppose so.

43:45.897 --> 43:48.858
Moscow will be very gay and exciting.

43:48.983 --> 43:53.238
Pierre, why don't we stay here
and not go to the country?

43:53.363 --> 43:56.950
Not this year.
It'll be such a gay season.

43:57.075 --> 44:02.997
I'm not interested. Besides, I have
work at the hospital, the school.

44:03.122 --> 44:08.795
They'll do just as well without you
in the hospital and the schools.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.922
I promised those people.

44:11.047 --> 44:14.842
Well, I never liked the idea!

44:14.968 --> 44:18.054
Pierre, come here.

44:19.138 --> 44:22.809
Listen, you know what we can do?

44:22.934 --> 44:26.813
You go to the country all by yourself.
Do what you have to do.

44:26.938 --> 44:31.901
Get the house ready,
then I'll join you in the spring.

44:32.026 --> 44:35.488
The country's so dreary in the winter.

44:35.613 --> 44:38.283
Please don't force it on me, Pierre.

44:38.408 --> 44:42.453
If you must stay, stay,
but I'll be lost without you there.

44:42.579 --> 44:46.791
Nonsense.
It will be good for the both of us.

44:46.916 --> 44:51.379
And you'll appreciate me more when
you haven't seen me for some time.

44:51.504 --> 44:55.717
I couldn't appreciate you more, Hélene.

44:57.093 --> 45:02.849
If you only knew how many things
I have to do, dresses to have made,

45:02.974 --> 45:05.101
lots of shoes and...

45:06.102 --> 45:10.273
Why are you looking at me
like that? Why?

45:13.067 --> 45:15.445
What does it mean?

45:15.570 --> 45:17.697
Nothing, my dear.

45:32.879 --> 45:36.216
They were defeated.
What are they cheering about?

45:36.341 --> 45:41.971
Because they fought, because they're
alive, because they've come home.

45:54.692 --> 45:57.237
I hope nothing's happened.

45:57.362 --> 46:01.658
- Gracious! The young Captain!
- Prokofy!

46:01.783 --> 46:04.118
Prokofy, is everything all right?

46:04.244 --> 46:08.122
- The Lord be thanked. Yes.
- Good!

46:10.208 --> 46:12.252
Nicholas!

46:12.377 --> 46:14.546
Natasha!

46:14.671 --> 46:20.552
You're back!
It's you, my dearest Nicholas!

46:22.762 --> 46:25.098
Sonya!

46:25.223 --> 46:29.561
- Look, it's him!
- Nicholas! Hurray!

46:33.439 --> 46:36.776
- Papa!
- Nicholas!

46:36.901 --> 46:39.028
Nicholas!

46:44.450 --> 46:46.911
Nicholas...

46:49.038 --> 46:50.456
Mama.

46:59.799 --> 47:02.510
- You must be...?
- Your son's friend.

47:02.635 --> 47:06.723
I know, Nicholas wrote to us.
Natasha, Sonya!

47:06.848 --> 47:08.975
Welcome.

47:10.602 --> 47:13.521
- Welcome.
- Sonya, it's wonderful!

47:13.646 --> 47:18.067
Nicholas!
You haven't said hello to Sonya yet.

47:20.486 --> 47:26.159
What's the sense of coming home
from a war, if that's all you do?

47:37.503 --> 47:41.132
- Good morning.
- Ah, my pipe.

47:42.717 --> 47:44.844
Rostov, wake up!

47:45.803 --> 47:50.141
- Why, is it late?
- "It's 10 o'clock. Get up, Nicholas!"

47:50.266 --> 47:52.393
Directly.

47:55.313 --> 47:59.943
Is this your saber? Or yours?
Get back, you Frenchman!

48:02.070 --> 48:06.282
- Here I come!
- At last!

48:08.368 --> 48:13.748
Why did you stay in bed so long?
I've been waiting for you to get up.

48:13.873 --> 48:20.296
You're quite a man, aren't you?
I'm awfully glad you're my brother.

48:20.421 --> 48:25.426
I want to know what men are like.
Are you the same as all of them?

48:25.552 --> 48:32.058
- Natasha... Sonya's so young.
- Sonya's my dearest friend.

48:32.183 --> 48:36.646
If she loves someone, she does it
for life. She loves us like that.

48:36.771 --> 48:42.151
Remember before you went away?
She told me you're to forget all that.

48:42.277 --> 48:49.576
"I will love him always, but let him
be free." Isn't that lovely and noble?

48:49.701 --> 48:54.622
- I'll never go back on my word.
- But it won't do.

48:54.747 --> 48:58.209
Because if you marry her
because of a promise,

48:58.334 --> 49:04.632
it'll seem you're marrying her because
you must, and that wouldn't be right.

49:04.757 --> 49:09.929
We'll talk it over later.
I'm so glad I have you!

49:10.054 --> 49:15.560
- Are you still true to Pierre?
- Don't be silly!

49:15.685 --> 49:19.939
I'll be a dancer and never marry.
Don't tell anyone.

49:21.149 --> 49:24.152
Get dressed and we'll have breakfast.

49:34.787 --> 49:36.206
Andrei!

49:38.291 --> 49:40.585
Did you get my letter?

49:40.710 --> 49:44.172
I met the doctor at the last relay point.
Are we in time?

49:44.297 --> 49:50.178
- Let's hope so. We must pray for her.
- What a strange fate.

50:10.281 --> 50:12.825
My darling, God is merciful.

50:12.951 --> 50:16.788
I love you. I love you all.

50:16.913 --> 50:20.333
I've never done any harm to anyone.

50:20.458 --> 50:24.254
Why must I suffer so?
Andrei, please help me!

50:24.379 --> 50:28.383
My boy, you have to leave now.

50:33.096 --> 50:35.431
There, there, my dear.

51:47.879 --> 51:50.256
No... no!

52:36.302 --> 52:41.307
Upon my word, Rostov,
if I were to see fifty more operas,

52:41.432 --> 52:45.103
I wager I might wind up liking them!

52:45.228 --> 52:48.398
But... I do like the intermissions.

52:50.650 --> 52:55.029
- I say, Rostov, that one, there.
- Yes?

52:55.154 --> 52:57.115
She's superb.

52:59.826 --> 53:02.704
But wait. Well!

53:02.829 --> 53:05.999
- Where's the husband?
- Pierre...

53:06.124 --> 53:10.587
He spends most of his time
in the country nowadays.

53:12.797 --> 53:15.008
If I were the husband,

53:15.133 --> 53:18.469
I'd come up from the country fast!

53:49.918 --> 53:52.420
To the Emperor!

54:02.555 --> 54:06.851
Listen, we took the bear
to the house of that actress,

54:06.976 --> 54:09.479
and when the police tried to arrest us,

54:09.604 --> 54:12.815
we tied one of them
on the back of the bear

54:12.941 --> 54:16.486
and shoved them both into the river!

54:16.611 --> 54:20.573
There they were, both swimming,
the man and the bear.

54:20.698 --> 54:25.203
- Wake up! The party's still young!
- Don't be rough with him.

54:25.328 --> 54:28.706
Always be polite to the husbands
of pretty women.

54:28.831 --> 54:31.793
Let's drink to the health
of beautiful women!

54:31.918 --> 54:37.131
Yes, to the health
of lovely women, huh, Pierre?

54:37.257 --> 54:39.175
And to their lovers!

54:44.472 --> 54:50.353
Here, look at this. It's a new song
written about General Kutuzov.

54:52.355 --> 54:54.649
- That interests me.
- What?

54:54.774 --> 54:58.111
I said that interests me.

55:23.177 --> 55:26.264
Express your regrets
and he'll accept them.

55:26.389 --> 55:29.601
No. What is there to talk about?
Is everything ready?

55:29.726 --> 55:33.771
- No apologies.
- First, tell me how to use this thing.

55:33.897 --> 55:37.233
It's very simple.
You cock it, there's the trigger.

55:37.358 --> 55:39.652
Yes, I know, I just forgot.

55:42.322 --> 55:44.574
No apologies. None whatever.

55:52.457 --> 55:56.044
On the count of three,
begin to advance.

55:59.964 --> 56:03.426
One, two, three.

56:20.151 --> 56:22.403
Get away from here!

56:22.529 --> 56:24.739
It's not over!

56:32.914 --> 56:35.750
To your barrier! Stay where you are!

56:39.587 --> 56:42.507
Cover yourself, you fool!

57:19.419 --> 57:23.214
Well, now, the hero!
The dashing duelist!

57:23.339 --> 57:26.801
My protector!
Thank you for defending my honor.

57:26.926 --> 57:32.098
You believed that Dolokhov
was my lover. What did you prove?

57:32.223 --> 57:37.687
That you are a fool! Now I'll be
the laughing stock of all Moscow!

57:37.812 --> 57:40.440
Everyone will say
that you were drunk.

57:40.565 --> 57:44.319
Challenging a man that
you were jealous of, without cause!

57:44.444 --> 57:50.325
A man that is a better man
than you are in every way!

57:50.450 --> 57:53.995
- We'd better separate.
- Separate?

57:54.120 --> 57:58.082
That's a charming idea!
It's a wonderful idea!

57:58.208 --> 58:01.920
It's the best idea you've had
in your whole life!

58:02.045 --> 58:05.465
We'll separate, but you will pay for it!

58:05.590 --> 58:08.676
You'll give me a fortune for it!

58:08.801 --> 58:10.511
No!

58:13.056 --> 58:16.309
Get out!

58:22.148 --> 58:25.318
The count is waiting for you upstairs.

58:44.087 --> 58:47.590
- What have you heard?
- Dolokhov won't die.

58:47.715 --> 58:49.842
Thank God.

58:51.594 --> 58:54.305
It's only easier to kill good men.

58:55.181 --> 58:58.601
Men like Dolokhov
are only good for wars.

58:58.726 --> 59:04.732
In between wars, they ought
to be locked up in cages. Here.

59:04.858 --> 59:06.860
I'd like to leave Moscow.

59:06.985 --> 59:13.283
I want to get away from these people
who believe it's normal to kill.

59:15.201 --> 59:18.580
At the banquet,
when Dolokhov made the toast,

59:18.705 --> 59:21.875
I looked across at him smiling at me,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.752
I was convinced
of the guilt of my wife.

59:24.878 --> 59:29.215
Is that a reason to kill?
Hélene was guilty, not Dolokhov.

59:29.340 --> 59:34.429
I might have done the same thing.
Maybe it's even certain.

59:35.346 --> 59:40.977
There we were, in the snow,
facing each other with pistols.

59:41.102 --> 59:46.024
- You know who's guilty? I, only I.
- Pierre, don't be silly.

59:46.149 --> 59:50.862
And you know why? Because
I married her without loving her.

59:50.987 --> 59:54.574
I had to have her,
so I made myself blind.

59:54.699 --> 59:58.912
I lied when I said to her, "I love you."

59:59.037 --> 01:00:01.456
Because of that

01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:05.835
there's Dolokhov stretched in pain,
alive only by the grace of God.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.673
Because of my weakness, my lie.
I'm guilty. I must suffer for it.

01:00:10.798 --> 01:00:16.679
You must stop thinking like this,
or it'll become an obsession.

01:00:16.804 --> 01:00:23.269
Look, if you'll agree,
we'll all go to our place in the country.

01:00:23.394 --> 01:00:27.982
And Nicholas wants to show it
to Denisov. Come with us?

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:32.111
Of course you'll come.
I'll tell the family. Mama!

01:00:33.112 --> 01:00:40.453
Natasha, Sonya, Petya! Hurry!
We start for the country tonight.

01:00:40.578 --> 01:00:44.123
Why didn't you tell me
Pierre was here?

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:47.252
We must start while the moon is high.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:51.673
Ilya, what has happened?
What moon are you speaking of?

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:56.970
Is there more than one, my pet?
How long must we wait for Nicholas?

01:00:57.095 --> 01:01:02.517
I'm happy you made up your mind.
The snow will be gone tomorrow!

01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:05.478
Sonya, hurry.

01:01:05.603 --> 01:01:08.731
- Order the troikas.
- Immediately!

01:01:08.857 --> 01:01:14.112
We're off! Hurry, Nicholas,
you're delaying the trip to the country.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:18.825
- The country?
- You can show Denisov. Come on!

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.705
- You'll like this.
- I was just beginning to enjoy Moscow!

01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:29.878
Faster, faster, faster!

01:01:30.503 --> 01:01:32.797
Faster, Nitka!

01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:40.930
As we ride in the troika, you and I
Stars are twinkling up in the sky

01:01:41.055 --> 01:01:48.521
Strains of sweet balalaika soft and low
Sleigh bells tinkling across the snow

01:01:54.819 --> 01:01:58.823
Hold me close and kiss me, Katiusha
Let's be happy and gay, hey!

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.658
When I'm gone you'll miss me, Katiusha

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:03.536
Miss me many a day!

01:02:05.663 --> 01:02:07.832
Nicholas!

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:12.378
- Come on, Pierre, it's your turn now!
- Hurry, hurry!

01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:15.924
Young Nicholas!

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.566
Petya!

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:16.943
Ever since Nicholas joined the army,
he's become terribly efficient.

01:03:17.068 --> 01:03:20.363
- I quite agree with you.
- Just a minute...

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:26.202
That's my friend, Prince Andrei
Bolkonsky. Can he join us?

01:03:26.327 --> 01:03:29.289
- By all means!
- Do ask him.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.170
Come on, Natasha!

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:46.222
Greetings! Good to see you.
I didn't know you were in the country.

01:03:46.347 --> 01:03:49.267
The Rostovs invite you
to join the hunt.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:54.189
I'm afraid anyone else's society would
give me more pain than pleasure.

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:01.738
Prince Andrei, may I present
the Countess Rostova.

01:04:01.863 --> 01:04:04.282
And her brother, Petya Rostov.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:09.037
I hope Pierre's convinced you to come.
It's the year's best hunt.

01:04:09.162 --> 01:04:15.752
The huntsman's found a wolf
and cubs. We'd be so delighted if...

01:04:15.877 --> 01:04:19.380
What I mean is you would enjoy it.

01:04:19.505 --> 01:04:22.300
Perhaps I'll join you later.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.969
- And stay to dinner?
- Possibly.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.096
But you just said...

01:04:27.222 --> 01:04:30.225
- Shall I come now?
- Wonderful!

01:05:33.788 --> 01:05:37.292
- I'm glad you stayed tonight.
- So am I.

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:40.044
- The Rostovs are charming, no?
- Charming.

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:43.172
It's wonderful to watch them together,

01:05:43.298 --> 01:05:46.593
like a race of handsome, healthy,
thoughtless animals.

01:05:46.718 --> 01:05:49.971
- Thoughtless?
- Their most charming characteristic.

01:05:50.096 --> 01:05:52.265
- All of them?
- All of them.

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:53.975
No.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.146
Within a year or two,
Natasha will begin to think.

01:05:58.271 --> 01:06:02.859
It'll make her even more charming
but less of a Rostov. Follow?

01:06:02.984 --> 01:06:04.861
I think so.

01:06:06.279 --> 01:06:11.993
Andrei, I think it's bad for you,
it's wrong to stay down here,

01:06:12.118 --> 01:06:16.915
year after year, brooding,
living the life of a hermit.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.250
Bad? Wrong?

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:24.714
Only two things in this life
are really wrong, Pierre,

01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:29.052
remorse and illness, and
when I've recovered from them both,

01:06:29.177 --> 01:06:34.599
- I'll go out in the world again.
- Why are you remorseful?

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.018
I was too late.

01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:39.979
I let Lise die feeling unloved.

01:06:40.104 --> 01:06:46.694
I was too busy on the trail of glory
to take the time to comfort my wife.

01:06:46.819 --> 01:06:50.323
Well, I found glory.

01:06:50.448 --> 01:06:53.701
I stopped the retreat of 100 men
for five minutes.

01:06:53.826 --> 01:06:58.706
I was left for dead on a lost battlefield
in a lost war.

01:06:58.831 --> 01:07:04.420
I'll stop being a hermit,
when I can forget all those things.

01:07:06.464 --> 01:07:10.635
Well, I think I'd better go to bed now.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.887
Goodnight, Pierre.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.185
And thank you again.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.437
Goodnight, Andrei.

01:07:33.408 --> 01:07:38.746
- Natasha, come to bed, you'll catch cold!
- I can't sleep.

01:07:38.872 --> 01:07:43.084
After a day like this,
it's impossible to sleep.

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:47.422
Come and see the moon.
Look how glorious it is.

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.926
- Sonya?
- Yes?

01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:56.014
- Do you think Prince Andrei likes us?
- Of course.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:08:01.185
He's so silent. It's as though
he's passing judgment on us.

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:04.606
- I'm frightened of him, aren't you?
- No.

01:08:04.731 --> 01:08:10.445
I'm a little frightened, and yet
I wanted to take him by the hand,

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:13.740
look in his eyes and sing just for him.

01:08:13.865 --> 01:08:18.745
Poor man, he'd never come again
if I'd done that.

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:23.041
Did you notice
he almost never smiles?

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.752
While I was singing,
I caught him looking at me.

01:08:26.877 --> 01:08:29.839
He was smiling then.

01:08:29.964 --> 01:08:34.469
And I felt...
It's almost impossible to describe.

01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:40.934
I felt as if someone had given me
the most enormous, beautiful present.

01:08:41.059 --> 01:08:45.604
- Come to bed, Natasha.
- You try to spoil everything!

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:52.569
On a night like this, I feel like
hugging myself tight and flying away!

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:55.448
- Take care, you'll fall.
- All right.

01:08:55.573 --> 01:08:58.952
But it's a shame to go in
on such a night.

01:08:59.077 --> 01:09:01.246
It's like hearing wonderful music,

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:08.336
and you know it's going to be
the most beautiful you've ever heard.

01:09:08.461 --> 01:09:12.674
And being pulled away
and missing it for ever.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:19.389
- For ever.
- Natasha!

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.767
All right.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:50.920
- Nicholas, the expression on my face.
- What about it?

01:09:51.045 --> 01:09:54.090
- Do I look disdainful?
- No!

01:09:54.215 --> 01:09:58.136
- I'm sure I look disdainful.
- What for?

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:04.559
If I look disdainful, nobody will
notice this is my first ever ball.

01:10:06.477 --> 01:10:10.148
- How's this? Better?
- That's much better.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:12.400
Good.

01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:27.415
You must promise
not to dance with me.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:33.713
- No!
- No matter if no one says a word to me.

01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:39.219
- Promise not to dance with me.
- Why?

01:10:39.344 --> 01:10:45.225
Because it would be humiliating
if only my brother asks me to dance...

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.852
...out of pity.

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.355
- Promise?
- I promise.

01:11:07.747 --> 01:11:12.961
- Nicholas, is everybody looking at me?
- Can't you see for yourself?

01:11:13.086 --> 01:11:16.506
Not without changing the expression
on my face.

01:11:16.631 --> 01:11:22.262
- There's one awful thing about you.
- Tell me! The whole truth!

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:26.599
No girl I'll ever meet
will be able to amuse me like you.

01:11:26.724 --> 01:11:30.270
Don't talk like that.
Go and leave us to our fate.

01:11:30.395 --> 01:11:34.315
- Nicholas, look after your mother.
- Comfortable, Mother?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.568
Yes, my darling.

01:12:16.858 --> 01:12:19.360
What a horrible mistake.

01:12:19.485 --> 01:12:24.032
I shouldn't have come.
Nothing is going to happen.

01:12:24.157 --> 01:12:30.413
The night is going to be one horrible,
black, degrading zero.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:35.418
Count Denilov, meet my family.

01:12:35.543 --> 01:12:38.963
Madame Maria Peronskaya.
You know my wife.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:43.384
My niece, Sonya,
and my daughter, Natasha.

01:12:43.509 --> 01:12:45.637
May I have the pleasure?

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.235
Oh, dear.

01:13:07.242 --> 01:13:12.580
Perhaps I shall be more fortunate
later on. I shall try again.

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:18.294
- "Adieu."
- "Au revoir."

01:13:18.419 --> 01:13:22.340
Denilov is our hostess' first cousin,
worth millions!

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.259
Second cousin, dear.

01:13:24.384 --> 01:13:29.973
Ah, there's the French ambassador!
He looks as if he were a king.

01:13:30.098 --> 01:13:35.353
You're rather late, you know?
Most of my dances are gone.

01:13:49.367 --> 01:13:53.454
Why must I keep thinking
of Prince Andrei?

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:59.294
Am I so much in love with him
that all others seem ridiculous?

01:13:59.419 --> 01:14:06.134
We saw so little of each other,
and yet I remember every moment.

01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:09.929
If only he could have
brought me here tonight.

01:14:10.054 --> 01:14:12.432
Why doesn't he like the city?

01:14:12.557 --> 01:14:16.561
It isn't right for a man
to shut himself off as he does.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:19.856
I am so delighted to see you again.

01:14:26.446 --> 01:14:29.699
Will you honor me with this dance?

01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:34.829
- Pierre, nice to see you.
- Pierre, my boy.

01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:38.124
Will you honor me with this dance?

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:47.944
- Don't you just love dances?
- Not ordinarily.

01:15:48.069 --> 01:15:52.782
- This is my first in two years.
- I'm so glad you did come.

01:15:52.907 --> 01:16:01.249
I mean... Mama and Papa said it was
nice for you to visit after the hunt...

01:16:01.374 --> 01:16:05.336
Tell them I intend to come and visit often.

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:09.382
- Very often, if they'll permit me.
- I shall tell them.

01:16:09.507 --> 01:16:15.847
On moonlit nights, do you still want
to fly off to the moon?

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:22.061
- Where did you hear?
- My window was just below yours.

01:16:23.855 --> 01:16:27.025
What a disaster! You heard everything.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:30.320
No. You disappeared too soon.

01:16:34.032 --> 01:16:37.911
- You must think I'm an utter idiot.
- No.

01:16:38.036 --> 01:16:41.080
I don't think you're an idiot. I think...

01:16:41.206 --> 01:16:45.418
Permit me. May I have
the pleasure of this dance?

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:50.965
Thank you.

01:17:10.151 --> 01:17:13.029
What a joy it is to dance with her.

01:17:13.154 --> 01:17:16.407
Like holding springtime in your arms.

01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:20.495
Like holding a branch of lilac,
or a kitten.

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.581
Look at her now.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:32.840
If she looks back at me
and smiles on the next turn,

01:17:32.966 --> 01:17:35.969
she'll be my wife.

01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:07.125
Guide us with thine infinite wisdom...

01:18:08.668 --> 01:18:12.171
...teach us to abide in thy mercy,

01:18:13.381 --> 01:18:18.636
and if it be thy will,
let this bed be my grave.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:23.641
- I must talk to you just once more.
- Well, well...

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:27.979
It's about Prince Andrei, I suppose?

01:18:29.147 --> 01:18:33.610
Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday...

01:18:33.735 --> 01:18:36.237
Five days he hasn't been heard from.

01:18:36.362 --> 01:18:40.408
First, he comes to see me every day
and quite turns my head,

01:18:40.533 --> 01:18:42.452
then nothing happens.

01:18:42.577 --> 01:18:46.497
Now, I'll tell you about myself
when I was young.

01:18:46.623 --> 01:18:50.293
I had a cousin,
a handsome young man.

01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:52.670
Yes, really handsome.

01:18:52.795 --> 01:18:55.965
I know. Cyril Matveich.

01:18:56.090 --> 01:19:01.346
- Must everything end up in nothing?
- You're being impulsive.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:04.641
You must be patient. Very patient.

01:19:04.766 --> 01:19:09.979
Wait till a proper proposal has been
made to you. He'll show up.

01:19:10.104 --> 01:19:13.858
The last time, his proposal was
on the tip of his tongue.

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:16.903
He seemed so in love.

01:19:17.028 --> 01:19:21.783
I'm always a little afraid
in his presence. What does it mean?

01:19:21.908 --> 01:19:24.786
Does it mean that it's real love?

01:19:24.911 --> 01:19:28.164
- Are you asleep?
- No, my pet.

01:19:28.289 --> 01:19:31.000
I'm a little frightened myself.

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:35.713
- Now go.
- All the same, I shan't sleep.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:39.092
Such a thing has never happened
to me before.

01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:42.512
Could we ever
have thought it last spring

01:19:42.637 --> 01:19:46.558
that we should meet at the ball?
It must be fate.

01:19:46.683 --> 01:19:51.187
Clearly, it must be fate,
if everything led up to this.

01:19:51.312 --> 01:19:53.940
Need one be ashamed of a widower?

01:19:54.065 --> 01:20:00.655
No, darling, pray to God.
Marriages are made in heaven.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:05.159
Mama, how I love you. I'm so happy!

01:20:06.661 --> 01:20:09.414
Little Countess, are you asleep?

01:20:11.082 --> 01:20:14.586
Yes, dear, I'm asleep. Goodnight.

01:20:18.715 --> 01:20:21.843
Marry? Marry?

01:20:21.968 --> 01:20:25.513
As though life were not
complicated enough as it is!

01:20:25.638 --> 01:20:31.352
In such a hurry! You thought you
knew what you were doing last time!

01:20:31.477 --> 01:20:34.480
- This is completely different.
- It always is!

01:20:34.606 --> 01:20:40.445
Before I met her, life was sad,
meaningless, hopeless.

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:46.201
When you're over thirty, a man's life
should be sad and hopeless!

01:20:46.326 --> 01:20:49.704
- Father...
- All right, all right.

01:20:49.829 --> 01:20:52.874
Let's be reasonable.

01:20:52.999 --> 01:20:58.296
Her family is nothing.
Nothing, compared to the Bolkonskys.

01:20:59.172 --> 01:21:04.928
Her father was known
to chase every woman in Moscow.

01:21:05.053 --> 01:21:07.680
Without success!

01:21:07.805 --> 01:21:09.974
Now that he's grown older,

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:14.562
he's known to play
in every card game in Moscow.

01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:16.814
Equally without success!

01:21:17.398 --> 01:21:20.693
They're a happy family.
That's a success, too.

01:21:20.818 --> 01:21:24.030
Perhaps the greatest success.

01:21:24.155 --> 01:21:28.117
But you think
you're being fair to the girl?

01:21:28.243 --> 01:21:32.455
You're much older than she.
You have a son to bring up.

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.710
Who'll take the responsibility?
A little chit of a girl?

01:21:38.711 --> 01:21:44.634
I beg of you, put it off for just one year
and go abroad.

01:21:44.759 --> 01:21:51.849
There's a peace mission to Prussia
for the signing of a treaty.

01:21:51.975 --> 01:21:55.645
I know you wanted to go
on the mission.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:22:02.277
After a year, if you still have this love
or obstinacy, you marry her.

01:22:02.402 --> 01:22:07.240
That is my last word on the subject.
It's my last word!

01:22:19.252 --> 01:22:26.509
Is it possible that I, Natasha, will be
the wife of this strange, dear man,

01:22:26.634 --> 01:22:29.053
whom even my father looks up to?

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:34.559
Can it be true that there can be
no more playing with life?

01:22:34.684 --> 01:22:40.982
That on me now lies the responsibility
of my every word and deed?

01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:57.665
I have loved you
from the first moment I saw you.

01:23:02.837 --> 01:23:06.591
- Do you love me?
- Yes, yes!

01:23:23.525 --> 01:23:27.153
What is it? What's the matter?

01:23:28.196 --> 01:23:30.323
I'm so happy.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.796
- Did your mother explain?
- There's nothing to explain.

01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:51.135
She told you it can't be for a year?
You're young, I want you to be sure.

01:23:51.261 --> 01:23:56.599
- I am sure.
- One year's not long and you'll be free.

01:23:56.724 --> 01:24:01.312
If, within that year,
you find you don't love me...

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.941
Don't say anything like that again!

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.905
- A year? I'm not going to see you?
- Of course.

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:16.244
- I must go to Poland for a few months.
- Is there nothing that can be done?

01:24:16.369 --> 01:24:20.874
It's awful, I'll die waiting a year!
It's impossible, it's...!

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:26.045
No. I'll do anything, whatever you say.

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:29.215
We have the rest of our lives!

01:24:33.511 --> 01:24:38.474
At Tilsit in Prussia,
on June 13th 1807,

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.477
Napoleon met with
Emperor Alexander of Russia,

01:24:41.603 --> 01:24:45.815
for the purpose
of discussing a treaty of peace.

01:25:06.711 --> 01:25:09.172
They can't help liking me.

01:25:09.297 --> 01:25:12.300
I'm so willing
to do anything they wish.

01:25:12.425 --> 01:25:18.723
So ready to be fond of him
for being his father.

01:25:24.145 --> 01:25:28.983
- I'm Mary Bolkonsky.
- Charmed. My daughter, Natasha.

01:25:29.108 --> 01:25:32.362
- How do you do?
- Good afternoon.

01:25:32.487 --> 01:25:38.451
Excuse my father. He's not well
and asks me to welcome you.

01:25:43.289 --> 01:25:45.083
Some tea?

01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:49.003
- That would be...
- No, thank you.

01:25:49.128 --> 01:25:51.256
No, thank you.

01:25:57.303 --> 01:26:00.598
I suppose you've heard from Andrei?

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:03.101
Yes.

01:26:04.143 --> 01:26:06.062
Father!

01:26:07.063 --> 01:26:09.899
You're the young Countess Rostov.

01:26:10.024 --> 01:26:13.236
I didn't know
you were paying me a visit.

01:26:13.361 --> 01:26:17.365
Excuse my costume,
I came to speak to Mary.

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:20.243
Why wasn't I told?

01:26:20.368 --> 01:26:26.416
Count Rostov? I've heard a great deal
about you, a great deal about you.

01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:31.462
As the Lord is my witness,
nobody told me they were here.

01:26:31.588 --> 01:26:35.800
This house, utter confusion, chaos!
People coming and going.

01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:39.971
You can't find anything.
Even the papers in my desk.

01:26:40.096 --> 01:26:42.223
You must excuse me.

01:26:42.348 --> 01:26:45.310
I'm not prepared to entertain.

01:26:45.435 --> 01:26:48.730
I can't stand Moscow, anyhow.

01:26:48.855 --> 01:26:54.736
I wouldn't be here, except I've no
alternative. I'm forced to be here.

01:26:58.072 --> 01:27:01.367
We'd better leave now. Princess.

01:27:05.038 --> 01:27:07.624
Wait, I must talk to you.

01:27:07.749 --> 01:27:13.922
Dear Natasha, I'm certain my brother
has found happiness.

01:27:14.047 --> 01:27:19.093
Princess, I think it is not convenient
to speak of that now.

01:27:36.736 --> 01:27:42.033
Isn't it wonderful?
Aren't you glad you came?

01:27:42.158 --> 01:27:46.371
Until Andrei comes back,
I can't be glad about anything.

01:27:46.496 --> 01:27:48.706
It's only a few weeks.

01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:53.294
- You see that tall man over there?
- What about him?

01:27:53.419 --> 01:27:57.632
When we passed, I heard him say,
"That's the Countess Rostov.

01:27:57.757 --> 01:28:01.761
"The one who's going to marry
Bolkonsky. Lucky man."

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:06.015
- He said, "Lucky man"?
- "Lucky man."

01:28:07.767 --> 01:28:12.605
I must write that to Andrei.
He can tell his horrible father.

01:28:17.485 --> 01:28:20.113
- Countess Bezukhov has arrived.
- Bezukhov?

01:28:20.238 --> 01:28:24.075
One of my favorites!
I must call on her.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.288
Countess Bezukhov, I'm delighted
to see you back in Moscow.

01:28:28.413 --> 01:28:31.833
The city hasn't been the same
in your absence.

01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:36.629
I've brought my two girls with me,
as you can see.

01:28:39.799 --> 01:28:41.718
Well...

01:28:44.596 --> 01:28:46.389
Magnificent woman!

01:28:46.514 --> 01:28:51.144
You can understand
how men must fall in love with her.

01:28:52.228 --> 01:28:55.773
Dolokhov, see the girl in that box?

01:28:55.899 --> 01:28:59.319
Yes, she's lovely, but...

01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:06.534
...for you? No, Anatole,
she's not exactly your type.

01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:41.588
May I borrow your daughter
to sit with me in the next act?

01:30:41.713 --> 01:30:45.800
Countess, how charming.
Natasha, come along.

01:30:45.925 --> 01:30:49.095
- Isn't it exciting?
- Yes.

01:30:55.476 --> 01:30:58.938
Enchanting! You mustn't bury her
in the country again.

01:30:59.063 --> 01:31:02.025
You're too kind. Natasha, sit down.

01:31:04.277 --> 01:31:07.530
Now we can tear
all our friends to pieces.

01:31:11.284 --> 01:31:18.708
No one in the theater is talking
of anyone but you and your match.

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:22.587
- You know?
- It's the news of the season.

01:31:22.712 --> 01:31:24.756
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky!

01:31:24.881 --> 01:31:29.093
Every woman here is jealous of you
at this moment.

01:31:29.802 --> 01:31:32.639
Why, Anatole!

01:31:32.764 --> 01:31:37.060
May I present my brother?
Countess Natasha Rostov.

01:31:38.686 --> 01:31:41.481
He's the center of fashion in Moscow.

01:31:41.606 --> 01:31:45.485
He drinks too much
and plays for too high stakes.

01:31:45.610 --> 01:31:48.655
He also sees
the most amusing people.

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:52.033
Get him to tell you
everything to do this season.

01:31:52.158 --> 01:31:55.245
- Countess!
- You've been neglecting me.

01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:57.705
I was convinced you were dead.

01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:01.709
When I saw you at the ball,
six weeks ago,

01:32:01.834 --> 01:32:06.172
I thought, "What a pretty girl."
That's all I thought.

01:32:06.297 --> 01:32:08.967
But tonight...

01:32:09.092 --> 01:32:13.429
- But you felt it, too?
- I felt...?

01:32:13.555 --> 01:32:19.852
When our eyes met. Don't look guilty.
What's there to be ashamed of?

01:32:21.688 --> 01:32:26.192
Are you enjoying the opera?
It's very good, isn't it?

01:32:26.317 --> 01:32:29.404
Oh, is it? I haven't noticed.

01:32:29.529 --> 01:32:33.199
I haven't looked at the stage tonight.

01:32:33.324 --> 01:32:37.954
I must see you again.
You must come to my sister's house.

01:32:38.079 --> 01:32:40.623
Very soon.

01:32:40.748 --> 01:32:42.876
I think...

01:32:44.377 --> 01:32:49.674
My mother's in the country,
I may go up to be with her.

01:32:49.799 --> 01:32:51.926
She's enchanting.

01:33:03.938 --> 01:33:09.694
- Go away, Anatole, you'll distract us.
- All right, all right.

01:33:09.819 --> 01:33:12.572
You'll come.

01:33:12.697 --> 01:33:16.075
I'll take this as a pledge.

01:33:21.122 --> 01:33:24.292
My brother is very amusing, isn't he?

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:07.919
Bravo, bravo!

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.589
How lovely she is.

01:34:11.714 --> 01:34:15.260
I don't think so when I look at you.

01:34:15.385 --> 01:34:17.595
Natasha, come!

01:34:21.891 --> 01:34:26.437
- Did you enjoy it?
- Yes, thank you.

01:34:28.815 --> 01:34:30.608
You're enchanting.

01:34:30.733 --> 01:34:35.989
From the moment I saw you,
I never ceased worshiping you.

01:34:37.949 --> 01:34:43.204
- I hope you don't think us too informal.
- Oh, Countess, well...

01:34:56.426 --> 01:34:59.596
I'm madly in love with you.

01:35:08.021 --> 01:35:11.858
- Papa, we must leave.
- We can't go now.

01:35:11.983 --> 01:35:16.654
...like one big heart,
palpitating with emotion.

01:35:16.779 --> 01:35:23.244
His Majesty the King was so moved,
tears came streaming down his face...

01:35:26.372 --> 01:35:28.833
My cloak, please.

01:35:57.904 --> 01:36:01.157
I can't. You know I can't.

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:57.922
"Dearest Natasha, my fate has been
sealed, to be loved by you or die.

01:36:58.047 --> 01:37:02.677
"Your parents won't give you to me
for reasons I will reveal only to you.

01:37:02.802 --> 01:37:07.181
"But if you love me,
you need only say the word yes.

01:37:07.307 --> 01:37:09.225
"Anatole."

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:18.067
You're back.

01:37:19.986 --> 01:37:23.531
How was your evening?
Did you amuse yourself?

01:37:23.656 --> 01:37:28.328
Yes. I made excuses for you.

01:37:28.453 --> 01:37:32.081
I was worried about you.
How's your headache?

01:37:32.207 --> 01:37:34.876
- You read that letter.
- Yes.

01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:40.798
I'm glad. I couldn't keep it
from you any longer.

01:37:40.924 --> 01:37:44.219
- "You know we love one another."
- But Anatole Kuragin?

01:37:44.344 --> 01:37:46.930
- How happy I am.
- And Andrei?

01:37:47.055 --> 01:37:53.228
You don't know what love is.
You don't understand. Listen.

01:37:53.353 --> 01:37:57.565
How can you love a man for months
and suddenly...? Why?

01:37:57.690 --> 01:38:00.485
You've only seen Anatole three times.

01:38:00.610 --> 01:38:05.031
It seems to me
I've never loved anyone before.

01:38:05.156 --> 01:38:10.578
I've heard it's happened that way.
It's only now I feel such love.

01:38:10.745 --> 01:38:17.877
I felt he was my master and I his slave
and I couldn't help loving him.

01:38:18.002 --> 01:38:22.757
Yes, whatever he commands,
I must do. What can I do?

01:38:22.882 --> 01:38:26.761
If he loves you, why doesn't
he ask your father honestly

01:38:26.886 --> 01:38:29.597
for your engagement to be broken off?

01:38:29.722 --> 01:38:32.809
- Why all this secrecy?
- It doesn't matter.

01:38:32.934 --> 01:38:35.937
Whatever his reasons,
they are good ones.

01:38:36.062 --> 01:38:40.567
- I have no will, I love him.
- I won't let it come to that.

01:38:40.692 --> 01:38:42.318
I shall tell.

01:38:42.443 --> 01:38:48.324
You wouldn't tell anyone. Don't
torture me, I can't live without him!

01:38:48.449 --> 01:38:53.329
What are you saying?
Think about your father and Nicholas.

01:38:53.454 --> 01:38:57.083
I don't love anyone but him.

01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:58.835
Go, Sonya.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.172
I don't want to quarrel with you.
Go away!

01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:15.059
Anatole, where do you mean to take her?

01:39:15.184 --> 01:39:20.315
They'll find out about that Polish girl
you had to marry. It'll mean jail.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:27.906
It will be worth it. Even if it is for
one month or one week with that girl.

01:39:28.031 --> 01:39:32.577
Some things in life
are impossible not to have.

01:39:33.453 --> 01:39:39.083
- The driver you sent for.
- A drink. You have to drive far.

01:39:39.209 --> 01:39:42.879
- Get Metrevna to bring my cloak.
- A gypsy girl again?

01:39:43.004 --> 01:39:47.508
- An elopement.
- I like it. Romance, excitement!

01:39:47.634 --> 01:39:51.763
There is a priest waiting.
Don't let anyone stop you.

01:39:51.888 --> 01:39:55.475
There's a man for you!

01:39:56.976 --> 01:40:02.190
- You want me?
- Now, take this. Listen to me.

01:40:02.315 --> 01:40:06.819
The girl will be shivering,
she'll have forgotten everything.

01:40:06.945 --> 01:40:13.243
Wrap her up, or she'll stampede
back to the house for furs.

01:40:13.368 --> 01:40:18.831
Papa awakened, Mama screaming,
tears, recriminations, challenges!

01:40:18.957 --> 01:40:22.710
Always keep a young girl warm,
my boy.

01:40:22.835 --> 01:40:25.797
Up with the collar and whoosh!

01:40:29.551 --> 01:40:31.761
- Take it.
- But my coat.

01:40:31.886 --> 01:40:34.681
I will get you another one someday.

01:40:34.806 --> 01:40:37.267
All take glasses!

01:40:37.392 --> 01:40:40.061
Now, comrade and friend of my youth,

01:40:40.186 --> 01:40:45.817
we've had our fling and rebelled,
now farewell.

01:40:45.942 --> 01:40:48.820
- To your health.
- To your health!

01:40:51.739 --> 01:40:55.326
- How sad it is.
- Sure.

01:40:55.451 --> 01:41:00.540
- I still think you shouldn't do it.
- So do I.

01:41:32.739 --> 01:41:35.325
Sonya? Sonya!

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.456
No, I won't open it.
And I've sent for Pierre.

01:41:43.249 --> 01:41:46.502
I'll hate you for ever for this.
Open the door.

01:41:46.628 --> 01:41:48.755
No, I won't open it.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.697
- What's the matter with you?
- Your sister can't keep things quiet.

01:42:14.822 --> 01:42:18.201
- Things such as gossip.
- What?

01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:24.165
I know all about the money
you had to send to Poland and why.

01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:28.378
- It's not true.
- You must leave Moscow.

01:42:28.503 --> 01:42:35.176
Don't tell anyone. Besides your
pleasure, there's others' happiness.

01:42:35.301 --> 01:42:38.555
You'll ruin a whole life
for your amusement.

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:44.477
Then amuse yourself with women
of your own rotten breed.

01:42:44.602 --> 01:42:48.565
As a man of honor,
you can't talk to me that way.

01:42:48.690 --> 01:42:52.110
- Is it satisfaction you want?
- Yes.

01:42:52.235 --> 01:42:57.323
I take it back. I'd take it back,
I'd beg you for forgiveness.

01:42:57.448 --> 01:43:01.661
Drive this gentleman
wherever he wants to go.

01:43:26.603 --> 01:43:28.730
He's gone.

01:43:29.647 --> 01:43:32.567
She's in her room.

01:43:45.246 --> 01:43:50.210
- What are you doing here?
- I came to stop you.

01:43:51.502 --> 01:43:56.007
- Nothing will stop me.
- What do you plan to tell Andrei?

01:43:56.132 --> 01:44:01.846
- I wrote to him telling him everything.
- He's not good enough for you?

01:44:01.971 --> 01:44:07.018
You crawl after a gambler, a liar,
and a notorious womanizer!

01:44:07.143 --> 01:44:09.520
I'm going to marry him!

01:44:09.646 --> 01:44:14.275
Whatever he's told you, he's lying.
He's married already.

01:44:16.653 --> 01:44:18.947
It isn't true.

01:44:19.072 --> 01:44:21.366
Look at me, Natasha.

01:44:21.491 --> 01:44:24.327
Could I purposely deceive you?

01:45:02.782 --> 01:45:06.035
- The rumor's all over Moscow.
- Who started it?

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.455
Prince Andrei has sent back
all her letters.

01:45:09.581 --> 01:45:15.044
- That's bad. I am sorry.
- She's been quite ill.

01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:20.341
When she knew you were coming,
she insisted upon getting up.

01:45:26.890 --> 01:45:32.687
Don't tell her everything. One hasn't the
heart to scold her. She's to be pitied.

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.261
I hear he's in Moscow now.

01:46:08.348 --> 01:46:10.475
Ask him...

01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:16.648
- Ask him to forgive me.
- I will tell him, but...

01:46:16.773 --> 01:46:19.901
I know that can never be.

01:46:20.026 --> 01:46:22.362
All is over.

01:46:22.487 --> 01:46:27.116
Only I'm so tormented
by the wrong I've done him.

01:46:29.536 --> 01:46:31.454
Tell him...

01:46:32.372 --> 01:46:38.294
Tell him I beg him to forgive...
forgive me for everything.

01:46:43.049 --> 01:46:45.385
I will tell him everything.

01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:48.221
But remember I'm your friend.

01:46:48.346 --> 01:46:52.517
If you want help
or to open your heart to someone,

01:46:52.642 --> 01:46:56.938
not now, but when your mind is clearer,
think of me.

01:46:57.063 --> 01:47:01.442
- I shall be happy if it's in my power.
- I'm not worth it.

01:47:01.568 --> 01:47:04.195
No. You have your whole life
ahead of you.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.532
Ahead of me? No. All is over.

01:47:07.657 --> 01:47:11.411
Nonsense, Natasha.
Listen to me, look.

01:47:11.536 --> 01:47:16.457
Were I not myself, but the handsomest,
cleverest man in the world,

01:47:16.583 --> 01:47:18.585
and if I were free,

01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:25.008
I would not hesitate for one moment
to ask for your hand and your love.

01:48:04.505 --> 01:48:09.469
- It's not cold, Mishka.
- It must be well below zero.

01:48:09.594 --> 01:48:11.846
- Wonderful.
- Where to?

01:48:11.971 --> 01:48:14.766
Where? I don't know, Mishka.

01:48:14.891 --> 01:48:21.814
Are you looking at the comet, sir?
They say it means war and famine.

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:27.070
- All sorts of woes.
- Nonsense. Life is beautiful. Go!

01:48:27.195 --> 01:48:29.864
- Where to? The club?
- No.

01:48:29.989 --> 01:48:33.743
- Home?
- No. Just go, Mishka!

01:48:53.972 --> 01:48:58.977
"If Your Majesty wishes to avoid
shedding our people's blood

01:48:59.102 --> 01:49:03.690
"and consents to the withdrawal
of Your Majesty's troops,

01:49:03.815 --> 01:49:09.153
"I will forget what has happened
and agreement will be possible.

01:49:09.279 --> 01:49:14.200
"Otherwise, I shall be forced
to repel an aggression

01:49:14.325 --> 01:49:17.662
"that has been
totally unprovoked by me.

01:49:17.787 --> 01:49:22.959
"The decision whether to preserve
humanity from the disasters of war

01:49:23.084 --> 01:49:26.379
"lies in Your Majesty's hands.

01:49:26.504 --> 01:49:29.173
"I am, et cetera, Alexander."

01:49:30.717 --> 01:49:34.637
So... this letter is very polite.
Very eloquent.

01:49:34.762 --> 01:49:40.518
And it is full of fraternal expressions
of devotion from your Czar.

01:49:40.643 --> 01:49:45.982
Sentiments, which, I assure you,
are reciprocated by me.

01:49:46.107 --> 01:49:49.861
- However, in essence, Colonel...
- Bolkonsky.

01:49:49.986 --> 01:49:53.781
...Bolkonsky,
what does this letter express?

01:49:53.907 --> 01:50:00.830
It is not for me, as a mere messenger,
to express the wishes of the Czar.

01:50:00.955 --> 01:50:06.211
Come, come, my dear fellow,
you must have an opinion. What...?

01:50:11.049 --> 01:50:16.721
Where? Where have we met before?
Your face is familiar to me.

01:50:17.263 --> 01:50:20.683
On the field at Austerlitz, sire.

01:50:20.808 --> 01:50:23.686
Austerlitz... Austerlitz...?

01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:27.774
Yes, I do remember.

01:50:28.775 --> 01:50:32.612
You were lying
with a banner in your hand.

01:50:32.737 --> 01:50:34.447
Yes, sire.

01:50:34.572 --> 01:50:37.116
I thought you were dead!

01:50:38.493 --> 01:50:43.122
Well, well, here you are again.
I'm glad to see you.

01:50:43.248 --> 01:50:48.628
Now, Colonel, this letter,
what do you think it represents?

01:50:48.753 --> 01:50:54.133
It can only represent
the Czar's sincere wish to avoid war

01:50:54.259 --> 01:50:58.388
and to prevent the shedding
of both Russian and French blood.

01:50:58.513 --> 01:51:02.892
A praiseworthy aim,
and one in which I completely concur.

01:51:03.017 --> 01:51:08.439
However, what else
would you say was in this letter?

01:51:08.565 --> 01:51:13.361
Since you press me, sire,
for a personal opinion, I would say

01:51:13.486 --> 01:51:18.575
it is a request for the withdrawal
of your troops from our country.

01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:23.621
A personal opinion! That's how
the Czar told his messenger to put it.

01:51:23.746 --> 01:51:27.709
You personally say withdrawal, do you?
Say retreat!

01:51:27.834 --> 01:51:32.171
I'm a soldier and I use soldiers' words.
I am not a fool!

01:51:32.297 --> 01:51:38.011
I've been asked to put my head into
a noose while my enemies conspire!

01:51:38.136 --> 01:51:44.225
Sire, it is not my opinion when I say
the Czar is not your enemy

01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:48.563
and that he is not conspiring
against you.

01:51:48.688 --> 01:51:51.858
If you read his letter carefully...

01:51:56.988 --> 01:52:00.909
I will read the letter more carefully

01:52:01.034 --> 01:52:04.787
and send the Czar my answer later.

01:52:04.913 --> 01:52:08.082
Goodnight to you, Colonel.

01:52:20.678 --> 01:52:25.475
Gentlemen, tomorrow at dawn
we cross the Neman into Russia.

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.812
We'll talk of peace... in Moscow!

01:52:36.611 --> 01:52:39.405
And on 12th June 1812,

01:52:39.531 --> 01:52:43.409
Napoleon Bonaparte, at the head
of an army of 200,000 men,

01:52:43.535 --> 01:52:46.663
crossed the River Neman into Russia.

01:52:46.788 --> 01:52:49.791
To combat this aggressive invasion
of their homeland,

01:52:49.916 --> 01:52:55.380
the Russians welcomed the French
with a destroyed storehouse,

01:52:55.505 --> 01:52:58.633
a widely desolated land.

01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:08.518
Looting, burning!

01:53:08.643 --> 01:53:14.732
As soon as Napoleon approaches,
the peasants run off with their grain.

01:53:14.858 --> 01:53:17.986
What they can't take with them
they burn.

01:53:18.111 --> 01:53:25.451
If we don't put a stop to it somewhere,
it'll be a desert, a scorched earth!

01:53:25.577 --> 01:53:30.415
We must fight. The army demands it,
the Czar demands it.

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.710
And the people demand it!

01:53:36.337 --> 01:53:41.175
What does the army want?
To be destroyed?

01:53:42.135 --> 01:53:46.055
Because that would be
what would happen if we fought now.

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.559
Does the Czar want
to be brought to his knees?

01:53:49.684 --> 01:53:53.771
Because that would be
what would happen if we fought now.

01:53:53.897 --> 01:53:58.401
What do the people want?
To be the subjects of Napoleon?

01:53:58.526 --> 01:54:03.615
Because that would be
what would happen if we fought now.

01:54:05.158 --> 01:54:08.203
Gentlemen,
I have been put in command

01:54:08.328 --> 01:54:12.790
to give the army, the Czar
and the people what they want.

01:54:12.916 --> 01:54:19.839
And what they want is to drive the last
Frenchman from the soil of Russia!

01:54:19.964 --> 01:54:25.011
And that I propose to do when I can.

01:54:25.136 --> 01:54:29.682
- But the looting and the burning...
- Let it continue!

01:54:29.807 --> 01:54:31.935
Let it increase!

01:54:47.158 --> 01:54:51.204
- Soon they'll be at our gates!
- We'll stop him!

01:54:51.329 --> 01:54:55.542
- They should call up more men!
- Kutuzov is afraid!

01:54:55.667 --> 01:55:00.672
- He's a doddering idiot!
- What's wrong with the Emperor?

01:55:00.797 --> 01:55:04.676
We will show Europe
how Russia rises in defense...

01:55:18.022 --> 01:55:22.861
"Lord God,
hear us when we pray to Thee.

01:55:22.986 --> 01:55:26.781
"Strengthen with Thy might
our most gracious sovereign,

01:55:26.906 --> 01:55:29.367
"Emperor Alexander Pavlovich,

01:55:29.492 --> 01:55:35.164
"and give him victory over his enemy,
as Thou gavest Moses victory,

01:55:35.290 --> 01:55:38.501
"Gideon over Mideon,
David over Goliath.

01:55:38.626 --> 01:55:42.630
"Smite down our enemies
and destroy them swiftly

01:55:42.755 --> 01:55:47.302
"beneath the feet
of Thy faithful servants.

01:55:47.427 --> 01:55:54.726
"Preserve our army, give a bow
of brass to those armed in Thy name

01:55:54.851 --> 01:55:58.187
"and gird their loins with strength
for the fight.

01:55:58.313 --> 01:56:01.774
"Take up the spear and shield
and arise to help us.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:06.446
"Confound those
who have devised evil against us.

01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:12.869
"May they be, before the faces of
Thy warriors, as dust before the wind.

01:56:12.994 --> 01:56:17.415
"May Thy mighty angel
confound them and put them to flight.

01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:20.919
"Let them fall
before Thy servants' feet

01:56:21.044 --> 01:56:24.923
"and be laid low by our host."

01:56:25.048 --> 01:56:28.218
I came to say goodbye.
I'm leaving Moscow today.

01:56:28.343 --> 01:56:33.598
- Where are you going?
- To the army to fight Napoleon.

01:56:33.723 --> 01:56:36.643
You're going to join up finally?

01:56:36.768 --> 01:56:38.645
I don't know...

01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:43.983
I have to see what it's like,
what it means for myself.

01:56:44.108 --> 01:56:48.238
Prince Andrei is in command
of a regiment. I'll find him.

01:56:48.363 --> 01:56:52.742
- When did you decide to do this?
- A long time ago.

01:56:52.867 --> 01:56:57.413
- Even you, Pierre?
- You will stay to dinner?

01:56:57.539 --> 01:56:59.832
- By all means.
- To say goodbye.

01:56:59.958 --> 01:57:02.377
That's good. Come along.

01:57:02.502 --> 01:57:06.422
- Lots of my school friends are going.
- You must study.

01:57:06.548 --> 01:57:11.928
- Every man is needed.
- Every man not every infant!

01:57:12.053 --> 01:57:15.139
I can't study
when our fatherland is in danger.

01:57:15.265 --> 01:57:16.891
Be quiet!

01:57:17.767 --> 01:57:21.896
- You heard from Andrei.
- Yes, one letter.

01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:24.023
Did he...?

01:57:24.148 --> 01:57:25.942
How is he?

01:57:26.067 --> 01:57:29.362
Well enough, but sad. His father died.

01:57:29.487 --> 01:57:34.909
I know. Although his father was
my enemy, I prayed for him.

01:57:35.034 --> 01:57:39.205
He was the first person in the world
to disapprove of me.

01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:43.626
You're not really grown-up
until that happens to you.

01:57:43.751 --> 01:57:47.547
Did Andrei say anything about me
in his letter?

01:57:47.672 --> 01:57:49.424
No, Natasha.

01:57:49.549 --> 01:57:52.427
Will he ever forgive me?

01:57:52.552 --> 01:57:55.680
He has nothing to forgive.

01:57:59.684 --> 01:58:03.438
- You must promise me something.
- Yes.

01:58:03.563 --> 01:58:07.817
Don't let anything happen to you.

01:58:07.942 --> 01:58:10.069
If it did, I'd...

01:58:20.496 --> 01:58:23.166
Did you hear me, Pierre?

01:58:23.291 --> 01:58:25.335
Yes, I heard you.

01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:27.587
I promise.

01:58:36.262 --> 01:58:39.224
- And Pierre...
- Yes.

01:58:39.349 --> 01:58:42.518
If you do see Andrei, tell him...

01:58:46.064 --> 01:58:50.276
Tell him I prayed
for the soul of his father.

01:59:00.537 --> 01:59:04.749
Can you tell me
where I'll find Colonel Bolkonsky?

01:59:41.703 --> 01:59:44.622
This gentleman's
been asking to see you.

01:59:44.747 --> 01:59:47.041
Pierre!

01:59:47.166 --> 01:59:49.085
Andrei!

01:59:51.087 --> 01:59:54.215
- At last.
- What are you doing here?

01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:58.803
It's still hard to say.
I came to see the battle.

01:59:58.928 --> 02:00:00.847
Why?

02:00:01.890 --> 02:00:07.228
It's hard to explain, Andrei.
It's such an enormous event.

02:00:07.353 --> 02:00:13.651
Our lives will be different because
of what will happen here tomorrow.

02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:21.242
- I'm sorry about your father's death.
- He was an old man.

02:00:21.367 --> 02:00:25.872
He couldn't live with the thought
of being driven away.

02:00:25.997 --> 02:00:29.709
How are they taking it in Moscow?

02:00:29.834 --> 02:00:33.171
Mary has gone to your aunt's.

02:00:33.296 --> 02:00:37.967
It was Nicholas Rostov
who got her out just in time.

02:00:44.474 --> 02:00:49.145
So Anatole Kuragin did not honor
Countess Rostov with his hand.

02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:52.440
He couldn't. He was married already.

02:00:53.525 --> 02:00:59.656
It was all very long ago. She's had
time to forget her disappointment.

02:00:59.781 --> 02:01:04.369
- Remember our old discussion...?
- Yes.

02:01:04.494 --> 02:01:09.666
I said a fallen woman should be
forgiven. But I can't forgive her.

02:01:09.791 --> 02:01:14.087
But you can't compare
Natasha to a fallen woman.

02:01:14.212 --> 02:01:17.382
What romantic dreams I had.

02:01:18.716 --> 02:01:24.138
You mean, ask for her hand again?
Yes, that would be very noble.

02:01:24.264 --> 02:01:26.182
But...

02:01:29.811 --> 02:01:31.938
I'm sorry.

02:01:32.897 --> 02:01:36.818
How are you?
You seem so strange, disturbed.

02:01:36.943 --> 02:01:44.117
The night before a battle is fought,
men are likely to seem disturbed.

02:01:44.242 --> 02:01:46.744
It's more than that.

02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:49.330
Perhaps it is.

02:01:54.419 --> 02:02:00.884
I've been in many battles, but
for the first time I feel I'll die tomorrow.

02:02:01.009 --> 02:02:05.722
- Nonsense. Why?
- I just feel it.

02:02:05.847 --> 02:02:12.145
Why are you really here, Pierre,
when you hate violence and war?

02:02:14.147 --> 02:02:16.274
I don't know.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.614
Because I realised you can't hate
something you've never known.

02:02:24.157 --> 02:02:27.160
How will the battle go?
Our position's good.

02:02:27.285 --> 02:02:33.958
Success never depends on positions,
orders, plans or even on numbers.

02:02:34.083 --> 02:02:36.753
A battle is won
by men determined to win it.

02:02:36.878 --> 02:02:40.798
Despite those men at headquarters
who consider war a game,

02:02:40.924 --> 02:02:46.179
war is the most horrible thing in life,
and I'd never take prisoners.

02:02:46.304 --> 02:02:50.683
The French are my enemies,
they destroyed my home,

02:02:50.808 --> 02:02:53.895
exiled my sister and my child.

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.775
Now they hope to destroy Moscow.
Taking prisoners is playing at war.

02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:02.403
Take no prisoners! Kill and be killed!

02:03:02.529 --> 02:03:09.661
Without playing at war, we'd fight only
when it was certain death, as now.

02:03:12.121 --> 02:03:17.252
I'm sorry.
Why should I burden you with all this?

02:03:17.377 --> 02:03:21.798
If we're both alive tomorrow night,
we'll have a bottle and laugh.

02:03:21.923 --> 02:03:25.760
Forgive me, you're sleepy.
Time for me to sleep, too.

02:03:25.885 --> 02:03:28.221
I'd like to stay here.

02:03:28.346 --> 02:03:31.891
Go. Go!
I have no time for you now.

02:03:32.016 --> 02:03:37.772
My only friends now are the men
who'll fight at my side tomorrow.

02:03:48.575 --> 02:03:50.076
Goodbye.

02:03:50.869 --> 02:03:53.580
Whether we meet again or not.

02:04:12.015 --> 02:04:16.019
Take down a proclamation
to all troops.

02:04:16.936 --> 02:04:23.067
Soldiers, this is the battle
you have all longed for.

02:04:23.193 --> 02:04:27.405
Victory depends on you.
It will give us all we need.

02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:30.533
And a speedy return to our country.

02:04:30.658 --> 02:04:35.747
Act as you did at Austerlitz,
Friedland, Vitebsk and Smolensk!

02:04:37.081 --> 02:04:42.670
Let posterity say with pride
of each of you,

02:04:42.795 --> 02:04:46.799
"He was in the great battle
before Moscow."

02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.263
- What is Paris saying?
- All Paris regrets your absence.

02:04:52.388 --> 02:04:55.433
I should say they do. What's in there?

02:04:55.558 --> 02:04:58.728
- A surprise.
- What's that?

02:04:58.853 --> 02:05:03.066
A present from the Empress
for Your Majesty.

02:05:10.573 --> 02:05:12.700
My son.

02:05:15.537 --> 02:05:17.664
The King of Rome.

02:05:21.084 --> 02:05:23.211
Admirable.

02:05:29.592 --> 02:05:32.262
Take him away, De Beausset.

02:05:32.387 --> 02:05:37.433
It is too soon for him
to see a field of battle.

02:05:40.019 --> 02:05:42.397
Follow me, De Beausset!

02:05:45.775 --> 02:05:52.073
You must not leave. Stay and
we'll give you something to tell Paris!

02:08:51.502 --> 02:08:53.421
Fire!

02:09:32.126 --> 02:09:36.673
There's a lot of wind up there.
It's made of iron!

02:09:39.676 --> 02:09:44.806
Get down or next time it won't be
your hat that blows off.

02:09:44.931 --> 02:09:50.103
- Excuse me. I didn't realize.
- Number 3, you're too slow!

02:09:50.228 --> 02:09:52.564
Ready, fire!

02:09:53.857 --> 02:09:58.111
You can't stand here,
you're in the way.

02:09:58.236 --> 02:10:01.239
I'll try to keep out of everybody's way.

02:10:01.364 --> 02:10:07.662
Up with your sights, you're firing low.
Number 5, quicker with the charges!

02:10:13.209 --> 02:10:16.087
- You're not afraid?
- Are you?

02:10:16.212 --> 02:10:21.467
They have no mercy, when they
come singing over. Heaven help us.

02:10:27.265 --> 02:10:30.143
Ready. Fire!

02:10:33.187 --> 02:10:36.816
- Having a pleasant morning, sir?
- Interesting morning.

02:10:36.941 --> 02:10:41.196
Interesting?
You hear that, mates? Interesting!

02:10:45.033 --> 02:10:50.830
- Here comes a live one!
- Not this way. Towards the infantry!

02:10:51.873 --> 02:10:56.169
Found your friend, eh?
Know him well?

02:10:59.797 --> 02:11:05.053
Beyond the trees, the French infantry
are advancing en masse.

02:11:17.232 --> 02:11:20.777
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

02:12:09.742 --> 02:12:13.162
Lower your sights
and wait for the order to fire!

02:13:32.992 --> 02:13:34.994
Fire!

02:14:10.321 --> 02:14:16.202
Sire, our infantry regiments
have turned back and are retreating.

02:14:16.327 --> 02:14:21.583
The cavalry should have gone first
to clear the way. Send them now!

02:14:25.879 --> 02:14:29.841
- There's only four more charges, sir.
- Bring up more.

02:14:29.966 --> 02:14:32.093
I'll go, too.

02:16:44.392 --> 02:16:46.311
Water.

02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:54.193
Take me to a dressing station.
Help me.

02:17:22.013 --> 02:17:24.849
Doctor, he needs help.

02:17:27.184 --> 02:17:31.397
- How far have you carried him?
- I don't know.

02:17:33.733 --> 02:17:38.362
You should have saved yourself
the trouble. He's dead.

02:18:31.915 --> 02:18:34.835
Damn you, Napoleon.

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:37.754
Damn you to hell!

02:18:41.467 --> 02:18:44.304
Well, we've stood our ground.

02:18:44.429 --> 02:18:48.141
We've taken the worst
that Napoleon has to offer.

02:18:48.266 --> 02:18:52.520
We must attack tomorrow morning.
You agree, sir?

02:18:52.645 --> 02:18:56.232
Yes, I agree. Theoretically.

02:18:56.357 --> 02:19:01.154
According to all the rules that
we've ever learned about warfare,

02:19:01.279 --> 02:19:05.950
we must attack tomorrow morning,
but we cannot attack.

02:19:06.075 --> 02:19:10.538
- We're too exhausted to attack.
- But if we retreat...

02:19:10.663 --> 02:19:16.460
We give the ground to the enemy.
But he has paid too high a price for it.

02:19:16.585 --> 02:19:19.547
He will bleed to death from this victory.

02:19:19.672 --> 02:19:22.508
But we can't make a stand
before Moscow.

02:19:22.634 --> 02:19:24.886
Yes, General, you're right.

02:19:25.011 --> 02:19:28.848
You mean to abandon Russia's
ancient and sacred capital?

02:19:28.973 --> 02:19:32.018
Russia's ancient and sacred capital.

02:19:32.143 --> 02:19:36.897
Let me tell you, that question
has no meaning for a Russian.

02:19:37.022 --> 02:19:40.485
Such a question cannot be put.
It's senseless!

02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:45.406
The question I've asked you
to discuss is a military one!

02:19:45.531 --> 02:19:48.868
The question is of saving Russia.

02:19:48.993 --> 02:19:55.291
Do we give up Moscow or accept battle
and lose the army and Moscow?

02:19:59.587 --> 02:20:06.928
Well, I see I am the one who
has to pay for the broken crockery.

02:20:07.053 --> 02:20:13.226
Gentlemen, I've heard your views.
Some of you will not agree with me.

02:20:13.351 --> 02:20:19.649
But I, by the authority entrusted
to me by my sovereign and country...

02:20:21.025 --> 02:20:23.653
...order a retreat.

02:20:32.954 --> 02:20:37.959
Oh, faster! The French will be here
before we're ready to leave.

02:20:38.084 --> 02:20:40.628
Now, come on, up!

02:20:50.388 --> 02:20:53.808
Put all the glass things
in the front wagons.

02:20:53.933 --> 02:20:58.146
And the books... put them
in the low wagons.

02:20:58.271 --> 02:21:03.193
Take this and this. And these gloves.
I'll never wear them again.

02:21:03.318 --> 02:21:05.445
Thank you.

02:21:54.577 --> 02:21:57.497
They are the wounded from Borodino.

02:22:06.047 --> 02:22:08.841
Vera, hurry!

02:22:10.218 --> 02:22:12.345
Vera, come!

02:22:13.179 --> 02:22:15.723
Give me some water.

02:22:18.893 --> 02:22:25.608
- Have you seen the wounded men?
- Yes. I said they can live here.

02:23:20.288 --> 02:23:23.374
Someone badly wounded?

02:23:23.499 --> 02:23:28.421
Just about alive. It's a miracle
His Excellency has lasted this long.

02:23:28.546 --> 02:23:31.716
- His Excellency?
- Our colonel.

02:23:42.227 --> 02:23:44.354
Miss Sonya.

02:23:44.854 --> 02:23:50.068
Don't tell anyone about this. Not yet.
Promise me.

02:24:08.086 --> 02:24:12.298
Aunt, Prince Andrei is here,
among the wounded.

02:24:13.258 --> 02:24:17.971
- Andrei?
- He's unconscious, terribly wounded.

02:24:18.096 --> 02:24:20.473
- Natasha?
- She doesn't know.

02:24:20.598 --> 02:24:23.476
- She mustn't know.
- He's dying.

02:24:23.601 --> 02:24:26.145
Natasha must not know.

02:24:29.065 --> 02:24:34.445
All right, get those wagons moving.
Turn them around!

02:24:34.571 --> 02:24:38.074
We've got another load of wounded
back there!

02:24:38.199 --> 02:24:42.120
After we've left and
the wounded are here, what then?

02:24:42.245 --> 02:24:48.418
I don't know. My orders are to get
back and pick up more wounded.

02:24:48.543 --> 02:24:53.965
They're to be left here, deserted,
to be taken prisoner, to die?

02:24:54.090 --> 02:24:58.678
- That's in other hands than ours.
- Take those chairs down.

02:24:59.846 --> 02:25:04.726
- That's enough. Put it down.
- Papa, we can't do this.

02:25:04.851 --> 02:25:10.356
- Oh, the settee...
- The three men will become prisoners.

02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:12.984
What three men?

02:25:13.109 --> 02:25:19.032
But of course. If we leave the settee,
what will happen to your mother?

02:25:19.157 --> 02:25:22.493
- I'll speak to Mother.
- Back in!

02:25:22.619 --> 02:25:26.664
You three are to come with us
on that cart.

02:25:32.378 --> 02:25:36.299
- Your men must use my house.
- Count, please help.

02:25:36.424 --> 02:25:40.136
- Is there a cart for this poor fellow?
- Of course.

02:26:02.951 --> 02:26:05.370
Hurry, hurry!

02:26:05.495 --> 02:26:09.999
- All those men, Papa.
- I know, it's very sad.

02:26:10.124 --> 02:26:13.545
- Still, in a war...
- We must take them with us.

02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:18.675
We're going to unload everything
and take every man who can travel.

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.844
You're right. So very right.

02:26:23.304 --> 02:26:26.474
Take those back. Put that down.

02:26:26.599 --> 02:26:30.562
Unload all the carts. Do as you're told!

02:26:30.687 --> 02:26:34.983
- Tell your men there's room for all.
- Thank you, sir.

02:26:35.108 --> 02:26:36.526
Take those off!

02:26:38.111 --> 02:26:42.657
Take this off, take it all down.
Unload the cart.

02:26:42.782 --> 02:26:46.035
Unload this cart completely.
Overboard with that.

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.205
Take all that down!

02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:52.458
Take down that table, we don't need it.

02:26:52.584 --> 02:26:57.922
Empty the cart straight away.
All this out. Come and help!

02:26:58.047 --> 02:27:03.094
Ilya, what is this?
They're unloading everything.

02:27:03.219 --> 02:27:06.931
- To make room for the wounded.
- But our things!

02:27:07.056 --> 02:27:12.896
Things! Things can be bought.
Think what it means to be left behind.

02:27:13.021 --> 02:27:16.232
The government ought to care
for the wounded.

02:27:16.357 --> 02:27:20.069
Mama, you can't object.
Look at them.

02:27:20.195 --> 02:27:25.283
You'd leave them behind
to save some furniture? Mama!

02:27:25.408 --> 02:27:29.495
Suppose Nicholas was one of them.
Or Petya.

02:27:30.246 --> 02:27:33.374
Nicholas? Petya?

02:27:33.499 --> 02:27:38.671
Of course, you're right, darling.
I'm sorry, Ilya.

02:27:40.632 --> 02:27:43.301
The chicks are teaching the hen!

02:27:43.426 --> 02:27:47.639
Ten more minutes!
We leave in ten minutes!

02:27:58.441 --> 02:28:03.696
- I'm ready now, Ilya.
- Come along, girls, in you get.

02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:15.625
- In God's name, off.
- In God's name, off!

02:29:03.423 --> 02:29:07.635
Dear Moscow, everybody's leaving you.

02:29:13.182 --> 02:29:17.770
- Look! Over there by the corner!
- Who is it?

02:29:17.896 --> 02:29:21.608
Pierre! Over here! Pierre!

02:29:24.277 --> 02:29:27.113
Over here, Pierre!

02:29:30.116 --> 02:29:33.536
You're safe. You promised
you'd come back and you have.

02:29:33.661 --> 02:29:36.080
You mustn't stay. Come with us.

02:29:36.206 --> 02:29:41.252
- Did you see the battle, Pierre?
- Yes, I saw it. I saw too much.

02:29:41.377 --> 02:29:45.089
- Come with us.
- I must stay in the city, I've...

02:29:45.215 --> 02:29:49.219
- Stop the coach!
...something I must do.

02:29:50.929 --> 02:29:53.056
Go on!

02:29:54.015 --> 02:29:56.601
Remember me. Remember!

02:30:03.691 --> 02:30:07.362
Why wouldn't he come with us?

02:30:07.487 --> 02:30:09.447
I don't understand.

02:30:12.867 --> 02:30:15.078
- Natasha...
- Sonya!

02:30:16.663 --> 02:30:19.832
You're crying. For Pierre?

02:30:19.958 --> 02:30:23.878
For us, because we're leaving?
What, then?

02:30:24.003 --> 02:30:26.339
- I have to tell her.
- No.

02:30:26.464 --> 02:30:29.634
There's someone we know
among the wounded.

02:30:32.929 --> 02:30:35.431
Andrei?

02:30:35.557 --> 02:30:38.601
He's traveling with us now.

02:30:39.894 --> 02:30:44.482
Is he badly hurt?
Why didn't you tell me before?

02:30:44.607 --> 02:30:48.152
I didn't know how to tell you.

02:30:48.278 --> 02:30:51.573
He told you not to tell me.

02:30:51.698 --> 02:30:56.327
No. He's asleep or unconscious.
He didn't speak.

02:31:04.502 --> 02:31:07.046
He didn't speak?

02:31:59.682 --> 02:32:01.809
Moscow!

02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:06.397
Asiatic city of innumerable churches.

02:32:06.523 --> 02:32:08.900
Lots of them.

02:32:09.025 --> 02:32:13.279
Moscow the holy, here at my feet.

02:32:13.404 --> 02:32:15.490
At last!

02:32:15.615 --> 02:32:19.661
On the ancient monuments
of barbarism and despotism,

02:32:19.786 --> 02:32:25.625
I shall inscribe great words
of justice and mercy. Mercy.

02:32:40.473 --> 02:32:45.728
What a splendid reign the Emperor
Alexander's... might have been.

02:32:47.897 --> 02:32:53.152
Now, I'm ready to accept
the surrender of the city. Now.

02:33:00.243 --> 02:33:03.413
Well, where is the deputation?

02:33:07.584 --> 02:33:11.004
There is no one, sire.

02:33:11.129 --> 02:33:15.133
The city is empty, half of it on fire.

02:33:15.967 --> 02:33:19.429
There is no government.

02:33:19.554 --> 02:33:22.724
No one to surrender to you.

02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.813
That's impossible.

02:33:28.938 --> 02:33:32.108
Impossible and ridiculous!

02:33:36.362 --> 02:33:39.532
There must be a surrender.

02:33:46.122 --> 02:33:48.249
This is an insult!

02:33:50.043 --> 02:33:53.213
They're going to pay for this.

02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:05.975
The skyline, look. It's a village on fire.

02:34:09.562 --> 02:34:13.733
- It could be Mytishchi.
- It's further away than that.

02:34:13.858 --> 02:34:18.321
- Moscow's on fire!
- It's so windy and dry.

02:34:18.446 --> 02:34:21.115
Moscow! God have mercy.

02:34:22.659 --> 02:34:26.412
Oh, it's Moscow, poor Moscow.

02:34:29.290 --> 02:34:33.753
Natasha, Sonya, come and look.
Moscow's on fire.

02:34:34.963 --> 02:34:37.465
Moscow? Oh, no!

02:34:39.592 --> 02:34:41.719
How terrible!

02:34:43.096 --> 02:34:47.016
- Natasha!
- Let's go back to bed.

02:34:47.141 --> 02:34:50.186
- I must talk to you.
- Again?

02:34:50.311 --> 02:34:54.399
- Go back to bed.
- Give me permission to join the army.

02:34:54.524 --> 02:34:57.277
You already know it. It's no.

02:34:57.402 --> 02:35:03.074
I must go where I can do
the most good for my country.

02:35:03.199 --> 02:35:08.580
Your duty now is not what you think.
Your duty is to stay with us.

02:35:08.705 --> 02:35:13.001
I'm sorry, Papa.
I've already made up my mind.

02:35:30.101 --> 02:35:36.399
Do look. The whole city's on fire.
You can see it from the window.

02:35:39.903 --> 02:35:44.324
- You didn't even look.
- Yes. Really, I did.

02:35:44.449 --> 02:35:48.828
Go back to sleep.
You'll catch your death of cold.

02:35:48.953 --> 02:35:52.624
You, too, Natasha, darling.
Go to sleep.

02:37:13.246 --> 02:37:18.084
- Is it the French or us burning the city?
- Who knows?

02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:22.922
Please, your officers, where are they?

02:37:23.047 --> 02:37:25.341
Officers, Miss?

02:37:25.466 --> 02:37:29.679
I don't know. Down there somewhere.

02:38:32.408 --> 02:38:34.953
Forgive me, forgive me.

02:38:37.038 --> 02:38:39.832
I love you.

02:38:39.958 --> 02:38:42.085
Forgive me.

02:38:42.210 --> 02:38:44.587
Forgive what?

02:38:44.712 --> 02:38:47.006
For everything I have done.

02:38:49.592 --> 02:38:54.138
I love you more. Better than before.

02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:58.096
- I want all these fires put out.
- Yes, sire.

02:41:39.304 --> 02:41:44.100
Let me go! Take your hands off me!

02:41:44.225 --> 02:41:45.935
No!

02:41:48.187 --> 02:41:50.440
Let me go!

02:42:04.913 --> 02:42:08.917
- Where did he come from?
- I don't know.

02:42:15.924 --> 02:42:17.425
Ready!

02:42:21.221 --> 02:42:23.139
Aim!

02:42:24.098 --> 02:42:26.017
Fire!

02:42:27.602 --> 02:42:29.646
Cut them down!

02:42:34.734 --> 02:42:39.906
- Two others, quickly!
- No, no! Help me! Please!

02:42:40.031 --> 02:42:42.575
Please don't let them! No!

02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:45.119
No! No!

02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:48.289
Please! No!

02:42:52.252 --> 02:42:53.753
No!

02:42:53.878 --> 02:42:55.380
No, please!

02:42:59.717 --> 02:43:01.427
Ready!

02:43:03.346 --> 02:43:05.056
Aim!

02:43:06.182 --> 02:43:07.892
Fire!

02:43:08.810 --> 02:43:10.937
Cut them down!

02:43:22.031 --> 02:43:24.409
No, that's all.

02:43:24.534 --> 02:43:27.704
The orders were to shoot
only the incendiaries.

02:43:27.829 --> 02:43:30.415
Take them back to prison.

02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:32.667
Forward march!

02:43:46.848 --> 02:43:52.729
Don't brood. It's not for us to judge
whether we're to be spared or not.

02:43:52.854 --> 02:43:58.943
Finally, in the world to come,
God will give us a word of explanation.

02:44:06.284 --> 02:44:11.080
Here you are. Come here, boy.
You found me again, eh?

02:44:11.206 --> 02:44:16.169
That's the little fella. That's right.
Sit down there, be a good boy.

02:44:18.588 --> 02:44:24.260
Do you like cold potatoes?
At dinner the potatoes were delicious.

02:44:29.641 --> 02:44:31.935
Here you are, boy.

02:44:33.603 --> 02:44:36.564
Perhaps you'd like some salt.

02:44:45.156 --> 02:44:49.244
- That's better now, huh?
- I'm all right.

02:44:49.369 --> 02:44:55.750
- Why did they have to shoot them?
- What a sin. What a sin.

02:44:55.875 --> 02:44:58.795
Where there's law, there's injustice.

02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:01.839
Come on, boy, get up.

02:45:01.965 --> 02:45:05.218
But the maggot eats the cabbage
yet dies first.

02:45:05.343 --> 02:45:06.761
What?

02:45:06.886 --> 02:45:11.140
Things happen not as we plan,
but as God judges.

02:45:11.266 --> 02:45:15.186
Have you got a family estate, sir?
A housewife?

02:45:15.311 --> 02:45:18.481
Your old parents, are they still living?

02:45:19.732 --> 02:45:22.694
Perhaps you've got little ones?

02:45:23.653 --> 02:45:28.324
Never mind, you're young yet
and may have some still.

02:45:28.449 --> 02:45:31.578
The great thing is to live in harmony.

02:45:31.703 --> 02:45:35.415
Well, I was still living at home,
you know?

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:39.210
We had a well-to-do homestead,
a nice piece of land,

02:45:39.335 --> 02:45:42.380
and a house you'd thank God for.

02:45:42.505 --> 02:45:47.427
When we went mowing,
we were seven. Real peasants.

02:45:47.552 --> 02:45:53.308
Well, one day, I went into someone
else's forest to cut wood.

02:45:53.433 --> 02:46:00.899
The keeper found me, I was flogged
and sent to serve as a soldier.

02:46:01.024 --> 02:46:07.113
We thought that was a misfortune,
but it turned out to be a blessing.

02:46:07.238 --> 02:46:13.411
If I hadn't sinned, my brother would've
gone and he's got five little ones.

02:46:13.536 --> 02:46:16.789
Whereas I only had a wife to leave.

02:46:16.915 --> 02:46:21.628
We had a little girl,
but God took her before I left.

02:46:21.753 --> 02:46:24.672
You've had hard luck.

02:46:24.797 --> 02:46:27.967
We can make it into misery or into joy.

02:46:28.092 --> 02:46:32.263
Hard luck's like water in a dragnet,
you pull and it bulges.

02:46:32.388 --> 02:46:35.725
But when you've drawn it out,
there's nothing in it.

02:46:35.850 --> 02:46:38.728
That's how it is, dear boy.

02:46:38.853 --> 02:46:41.898
Now I think it's time to sleep.

02:46:46.611 --> 02:46:52.033
Lord Jesus Christ, Holy Saint Nicholas,
Frola and Lavra have mercy upon us.

02:46:54.118 --> 02:46:56.746
That's the way.

02:46:56.871 --> 02:47:00.375
Lay me down like a stone
and raise me up like a loaf.

02:47:00.500 --> 02:47:05.630
- What prayer was that?
- I was praying. Don't you pray?

02:47:05.755 --> 02:47:09.384
Yes. But what did you say?
Frola and Lavra?

02:47:09.509 --> 02:47:14.305
The horse's saints.
One must pity the animals, too.

02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:18.268
Come over here.
Get warm and lie down.

02:47:18.393 --> 02:47:20.520
That's right.

02:47:51.634 --> 02:47:56.848
- I thought you were asleep.
- No. I was watching you.

02:47:56.973 --> 02:48:00.351
Enjoying you. Being thankful for you.

02:48:00.476 --> 02:48:04.355
- Sleep, my dearest.
- No, not yet.

02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:09.819
I want to keep my eyes open.
I want to look at you.

02:48:09.944 --> 02:48:15.491
You know, you're not the girl
I saw dancing all night.

02:48:15.617 --> 02:48:19.078
The girl who whispered
on the balcony to the moon.

02:48:19.204 --> 02:48:22.832
You're something much better.

02:48:22.957 --> 02:48:27.170
How serene you are. How valuable.

02:48:28.588 --> 02:48:30.965
I love you so much.

02:48:31.090 --> 02:48:37.305
It's a terrible thing. Only at a moment
like this can one talk so openly.

02:48:37.430 --> 02:48:40.475
Until now, I knew nothing about love.

02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.144
I was a great hater, Natasha.

02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:48.399
I hated so many things,
but most of all I hated you.

02:48:48.525 --> 02:48:51.778
You had every right.

02:48:51.903 --> 02:48:56.324
I love you more than I've ever loved
anything on this earth.

02:48:56.449 --> 02:49:00.161
Maybe this monastery
has something to do with it.

02:49:00.286 --> 02:49:04.207
Maybe the monks
really know about love.

02:49:04.332 --> 02:49:08.670
Now I'm beginning to understand, too.

02:49:08.795 --> 02:49:13.007
Maybe death
is my private monastery.

02:49:37.365 --> 02:49:39.993
Where is he? Can I see him?

02:49:40.118 --> 02:49:43.538
- Of course. But is that his son?
- Yes.

02:49:43.663 --> 02:49:45.957
- And he's called...?
- Kolya.

02:49:46.082 --> 02:49:48.126
What a lovely boy.

02:49:48.251 --> 02:49:52.505
- Where is he?
- We've sent to ask.

02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:56.926
You must be tired, Princess.
We've prepared rooms for you.

02:49:57.051 --> 02:50:03.016
- Where is Petya?
- He left. We couldn't control him.

02:50:03.141 --> 02:50:08.229
He kept on about going into the army
until we just had to let him go.

02:50:08.354 --> 02:50:12.317
The war will probably be over
before he gets his commission.

02:50:12.442 --> 02:50:18.198
- Did you receive my letter?
- Yes, that was a good piece of news.

02:50:18.323 --> 02:50:21.492
- You and Mary.
- I'm worried about Sonya.

02:50:21.618 --> 02:50:27.290
- It's all right, I told her immediately.
- But I wanted to tell her myself.

02:50:31.836 --> 02:50:36.216
- Mary.
- Will you stay with us, little man?

02:50:36.341 --> 02:50:38.468
Now, my dear...

02:50:45.516 --> 02:50:48.061
Come with me, Mary.

02:50:50.438 --> 02:50:52.815
Nicholas, you come along.

02:50:54.025 --> 02:50:58.404
- Nicholas, I've read your letter.
- I know.

02:50:58.530 --> 02:51:02.075
She's a fine woman, isn't she?

02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:07.330
- If you want to, Nicholas, you're free.
- Forgive me, Sonya.

02:51:08.873 --> 02:51:13.211
Natasha, no one will tell me anything.

02:51:13.336 --> 02:51:18.508
How is his wound, his condition?
What did the doctor say?

02:51:18.633 --> 02:51:20.760
Is he worse?

02:51:45.577 --> 02:51:48.913
- Andrei.
- Hello, Mary.

02:51:49.038 --> 02:51:54.210
How did you manage to get here?
Have you brought little Kolya?

02:51:54.335 --> 02:51:58.756
- How are you now?
- You must ask the doctor.

02:51:58.882 --> 02:52:02.760
You see how strangely
fate has brought us together?

02:52:02.886 --> 02:52:08.266
- She looks after me all the time.
- Mary came from Ryazan.

02:52:09.934 --> 02:52:13.479
- You've missed Count Nicholas?
- Yes.

02:52:13.605 --> 02:52:19.652
He took a great liking to you.
It would be a good thing to marry him.

02:52:19.777 --> 02:52:22.739
Why talk of me, Andrei?

02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:28.036
Would you like to see Kolya?
He's outside.

02:52:28.161 --> 02:52:31.331
I'd be very glad to see him.

02:52:39.881 --> 02:52:43.092
Is it too much for you, all this talking?

02:52:43.218 --> 02:52:48.681
No. I want to tell Mary
so many things but I'm unable to.

02:53:00.527 --> 02:53:03.988
Kiss him, Kolya. Kiss your father.

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:15.208
Kolya...

02:53:15.333 --> 02:53:19.003
...no one is permitted to cry
in this room.

02:53:19.128 --> 02:53:22.840
Not children and not grown-ups either.

02:53:26.719 --> 02:53:30.932
I think you'd better
go out and play now.

02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:40.441
He's a handsome little boy.

02:53:42.902 --> 02:53:47.240
What is it, Mary? Is it about the child?

02:53:47.365 --> 02:53:50.159
You know the gospel.

02:53:50.285 --> 02:53:56.541
"The fouls of the air sow not, nor reap,
yet your father feedeth them."

02:53:56.666 --> 02:53:59.627
That's why you mustn't cry.

02:54:02.046 --> 02:54:04.591
Come sit beside me.

02:54:10.430 --> 02:54:14.642
The hardest thing
is to keep alive at sunset.

02:54:32.243 --> 02:54:35.038
I had a wonderful dream.

02:54:35.163 --> 02:54:40.919
I saw a door. I could see beyond it.

02:54:41.044 --> 02:54:43.796
I dreamt that I died.

02:54:43.922 --> 02:54:47.258
And as I died, I awoke.

02:54:47.383 --> 02:54:49.719
Yes...

02:54:49.844 --> 02:54:54.849
...death is an awakening, you see?

02:54:54.974 --> 02:54:58.144
It's all so simple.

02:55:05.735 --> 02:55:07.862
Is it over?

02:55:19.499 --> 02:55:22.001
Where is he now?

02:55:22.126 --> 02:55:25.171
Where has he gone?

02:55:30.009 --> 02:55:33.388
What is this? What is this?

02:55:34.472 --> 02:55:39.894
We are masters of the capital
of the largest country in the world,

02:55:40.019 --> 02:55:44.315
not a single civilian mouth to feed
and I get these reports!

02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.403
"The stocks are dwindling,
food is disappearing,

02:55:48.528 --> 02:55:53.575
"the danger point is approaching."
Who writes out these reports?

02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:56.870
Who is taking steps to correct them?

02:55:59.956 --> 02:56:04.127
I brought the greatest army
in Europe into this city.

02:56:04.252 --> 02:56:08.423
What do I see?
A mob of looters and drunkards.

02:56:08.548 --> 02:56:11.843
They are not soldiers any more!

02:56:11.968 --> 02:56:16.097
They are rag-pickers. Junk men!

02:56:21.895 --> 02:56:28.318
Kutuzov must have sent emissaries
to ask for the terms of surrender.

02:56:28.443 --> 02:56:32.363
What happened?
Are they detained? Shot?

02:56:32.488 --> 02:56:39.746
Sire, I myself have given explicit
instructions to all the commanders.

02:56:39.871 --> 02:56:45.126
There have been no emissaries from
the Russian Commander-in-Chief.

02:56:53.843 --> 02:56:58.973
The city's burning down
around our ears. House by house!

02:56:59.098 --> 02:57:04.270
I've given orders to shoot incendiaries
and even here, you cannot...

02:57:05.605 --> 02:57:09.484
...cannot get the stink of smoke
out of your nostrils!

02:57:09.609 --> 02:57:15.740
Gentlemen, take hold or
I promise you I will replace you all!

02:57:15.865 --> 02:57:20.328
With all your titles
and decorations and batons!

02:57:20.453 --> 02:57:26.167
I'll go and pick the first soldiers I find
who are not drunk...

02:57:27.168 --> 02:57:30.338
...and put them in your place!

02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:39.973
I warn you, gentlemen,
I cannot sit here much longer,

02:57:40.098 --> 02:57:44.143
watching my army decay.

02:57:48.648 --> 02:57:51.609
Close the windows, someone!

02:58:14.382 --> 02:58:17.176
Already the wild geese
are flying south.

02:58:17.302 --> 02:58:21.264
What if we are trapped here
through winter?

02:58:21.389 --> 02:58:26.644
Time and patience,
patience and time.

02:58:26.769 --> 02:58:29.647
The grand army's wounded,

02:58:29.772 --> 02:58:33.526
but is it mortally wounded?

02:58:33.651 --> 02:58:39.365
An apple should not be plucked
while it's green.

02:58:39.490 --> 02:58:42.660
Patience and time.

02:58:47.248 --> 02:58:50.627
Yes? Who is it? Come in!

02:58:50.752 --> 02:58:53.922
A special courier, Your Excellency.

02:58:59.844 --> 02:59:05.099
Excellency, the French are preparing
to leave Moscow.

02:59:07.894 --> 02:59:10.855
Come closer.

02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:42.720
Excellency, would you like me to...?

03:00:13.751 --> 03:00:17.171
O Lord, my creator.

03:00:17.297 --> 03:00:21.050
Thou hast heard our prayer.

03:00:22.510 --> 03:00:25.555
Russia is saved!

03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:29.392
I thank Thee, O Lord.

03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:53.208
Russian women.

03:00:53.333 --> 03:00:56.377
They're the lice
that live on the conquerors.

03:00:56.502 --> 03:00:59.339
They have to leave with them or die.

03:01:44.008 --> 03:01:46.553
Attack.

03:01:46.678 --> 03:01:50.598
The word "attack"
is always on your tongues.

03:01:50.723 --> 03:01:56.271
Gentlemen, they came
into our country like locusts,

03:01:56.396 --> 03:01:59.983
leaving nothing behind,
food nor shelter.

03:02:00.692 --> 03:02:06.865
Now they are going back the way
they came, through the desolation.

03:02:06.990 --> 03:02:11.786
A cold, hungry army,
2,000 miles from home,

03:02:11.911 --> 03:02:14.747
doing what every Russian wants,

03:02:14.873 --> 03:02:19.419
leaving our country
with all possible speed.

03:02:19.544 --> 03:02:22.839
The country is destroying them.

03:02:22.964 --> 03:02:27.594
And the Russian army?
Since Borodino, we've been in retreat.

03:02:27.719 --> 03:02:32.098
- Now, it must attack!
- For what?

03:02:32.223 --> 03:02:37.729
I wouldn't give one Russian soldier
for ten Frenchmen!

03:02:37.854 --> 03:02:40.565
Those retreats...

03:02:40.690 --> 03:02:44.736
...they've brought about
the destruction of the French army.

03:02:44.861 --> 03:02:50.074
And will bring about the liberation
of our country.

03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:55.872
The animal is running.
We will follow it...

03:02:55.997 --> 03:03:02.420
...and flick its haunches with whips
to encourage it to keep moving.

03:03:02.545 --> 03:03:06.925
We will follow it
to the borders of our country.

03:03:07.050 --> 03:03:12.972
We will offer the French
a golden bridge to the West.

03:06:55.945 --> 03:06:59.032
Get moving, there! Get moving!

03:06:59.157 --> 03:07:01.951
All stragglers will be shot!

03:07:02.076 --> 03:07:03.786
Get up.

03:07:03.912 --> 03:07:07.081
Get up! Keep moving! Get up!

03:07:08.875 --> 03:07:11.836
Come on, get into line.

03:07:12.712 --> 03:07:16.132
- Get up! Come on, get up!
- I can't.

03:07:16.257 --> 03:07:18.384
Get up. Now!

03:07:20.303 --> 03:07:22.222
Please...

03:07:23.556 --> 03:07:25.308
All right.

03:09:56.125 --> 03:09:59.712
971, 972...

03:09:59.837 --> 03:10:03.216
...73, 74...

03:10:08.471 --> 03:10:10.098
Get up!

03:10:10.223 --> 03:10:12.350
Get moving!

03:10:15.270 --> 03:10:20.692
Clear the road! Out of the way!

03:10:20.817 --> 03:10:23.987
Stand aside! Out of the way!

03:10:38.167 --> 03:10:39.711
Move on.

03:10:39.836 --> 03:10:42.964
Move on! Keep moving!

03:10:43.965 --> 03:10:49.804
- Move on. Move on!
- One, two, three...

03:10:49.929 --> 03:10:53.725
What are you counting all the time?

03:10:53.850 --> 03:10:58.646
I count to a thousand and start again
to keep my feet going.

03:10:58.771 --> 03:11:02.483
You've never needed them before,
have you?

03:11:02.609 --> 03:11:06.070
Gentlemen ride in carriages
or on horseback.

03:11:06.196 --> 03:11:10.867
I've lived my whole life on foot
and yet you outlast me.

03:11:10.992 --> 03:11:15.205
Start again. One, two...

03:11:41.564 --> 03:11:45.777
...24, 25, 26...

03:11:48.571 --> 03:11:50.156
Get up!

03:11:50.865 --> 03:11:53.826
Come on, keep moving!

03:12:09.551 --> 03:12:12.720
Are you afraid, too, friend?

03:12:57.265 --> 03:13:03.771
One, two, three, four, five...

03:13:09.736 --> 03:13:13.448
Halt! Who are you?

03:13:13.573 --> 03:13:19.078
Ensign Rostov. I have a dispatch
from the Commander-in-Chief.

03:13:19.204 --> 03:13:21.581
Come, then.

03:13:21.706 --> 03:13:27.295
- How did you find us?
- Peasants in the village told me.

03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:35.470
- Dragoons?
- Yes, sir.

03:13:35.595 --> 03:13:39.057
- How many infantrymen?
- Maybe 100.

03:13:39.182 --> 03:13:42.852
- Or 200?
- Yes, sir. Perhaps 200.

03:13:42.977 --> 03:13:46.940
Perhaps? Get out
before I lose my temper! Out!

03:14:01.079 --> 03:14:06.209
- When was he captured?
- Last night. We won't keep him long.

03:14:06.334 --> 03:14:09.504
I usually do not take prisoners.

03:14:12.131 --> 03:14:17.178
- What is this dispatch?
- It's my general's dispatch, sir.

03:14:17.804 --> 03:14:20.265
- Who are you?
- Rostov.

03:14:20.390 --> 03:14:23.851
- You have a brother, Nicholas?
- Yes. You know him?

03:14:23.977 --> 03:14:25.895
Yes.

03:14:29.274 --> 03:14:34.612
"All patrols are to fall back
immediately to join the main army.

03:14:34.737 --> 03:14:37.240
"Prepare for a general attack

03:14:37.365 --> 03:14:41.578
"when the French attempt to cross
the Beresina River."

03:14:51.421 --> 03:14:56.384
Rostov, you didn't find me
to give me this till tomorrow.

03:14:56.509 --> 03:14:58.011
Why, sir?

03:14:58.136 --> 03:15:04.726
Those French stragglers, I'll attack
them tomorrow. One last fight.

03:15:04.851 --> 03:15:10.231
Let me come. I'll say I didn't find you,
if you let me fight.

03:15:10.356 --> 03:15:13.359
- No, no!
- Let me come.

03:15:13.484 --> 03:15:18.573
It's a bargain. But keep out of trouble
or I'll be in trouble with the General.

03:15:18.698 --> 03:15:20.658
Thank you.

03:15:20.783 --> 03:15:22.911
Go and eat something.

03:15:24.370 --> 03:15:27.582
Now, I will move in through the forest.

03:15:27.707 --> 03:15:33.922
You go to the other side of the valley
and attack at my signal.

03:15:34.047 --> 03:15:37.091
- Right. Any reserves?
- None.

03:15:37.217 --> 03:15:41.262
This is our last fight,
and we'll hold back nothing.

03:15:44.098 --> 03:15:48.895
- Ensign. You want some?
- Thank you.

03:16:05.954 --> 03:16:09.832
Hungry? Have this.

03:16:09.958 --> 03:16:11.876
Thank you very much.

03:16:29.519 --> 03:16:32.397
Stay behind me at all times.

03:16:32.522 --> 03:16:34.649
Charge!

03:16:41.614 --> 03:16:44.409
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!

03:17:56.731 --> 03:18:00.652
You must've wished
you'd killed me in that stupid duel.

03:18:00.777 --> 03:18:05.281
You probably haven't heard
that Hélene died in St. Petersburg.

03:18:05.406 --> 03:18:11.704
Finally, I want to ask you
to forgive me for the harm I did you.

03:18:24.467 --> 03:18:26.386
Halt!

03:18:30.515 --> 03:18:34.352
Take them away.
You know what to do with them.

03:18:44.737 --> 03:18:47.115
He wouldn't stay behind.

03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:50.118
It was a game for him.

03:18:50.243 --> 03:18:53.371
His saber was a toy.

03:18:57.292 --> 03:19:00.461
I never take prisoners!

03:19:52.263 --> 03:19:56.559
Stand by your guns!

03:19:56.684 --> 03:19:58.728
Stand by your guns!

03:20:15.036 --> 03:20:16.538
Fire!

03:21:55.845 --> 03:21:57.972
Yes, burn them.

03:22:51.860 --> 03:22:55.488
- Hurrah, lads!
- Hurrah!

03:22:56.698 --> 03:23:00.952
Hurrah! Hurrah!

03:23:01.077 --> 03:23:05.915
I thank you all for your hard
and faithful service.

03:23:06.708 --> 03:23:12.171
The victory is complete,
and Russia will not forget you!

03:23:12.297 --> 03:23:14.632
Honor to you for ever!

03:23:16.759 --> 03:23:20.138
Hurrah! Hurrah!

03:24:29.332 --> 03:24:34.504
Well, shall we see what's happened
to the rest of the house?

03:24:34.629 --> 03:24:36.756
Come on, Mary.

03:24:42.095 --> 03:24:48.393
Sonya, see what the kitchen's like.
Prokofy, you might find some tea.

03:24:48.518 --> 03:24:52.730
- Will you look in the cellar?
- Very well.

03:25:01.781 --> 03:25:05.952
Mama, Papa!
The north wing is just as it was!

03:25:06.077 --> 03:25:10.915
Nothing's happened.
We have a house. Half a house!

03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:16.087
Isn't it wonderful?
Mama, you can come and rest.

03:25:16.212 --> 03:25:18.339
We're home.

03:25:19.048 --> 03:25:22.510
Dunyasha,
make Mama a cold compress.

03:25:22.635 --> 03:25:26.472
Take this footstool.
She always liked that.

03:25:26.598 --> 03:25:33.271
The baby can go in my room.
Up you go! There.

03:25:33.396 --> 03:25:36.441
I hope we find a bottle of port.

03:25:36.566 --> 03:25:42.655
You see, Mary? You'll have
a born optimist as a father-in-law.

03:26:09.849 --> 03:26:15.104
I have loved you
from the first moment I saw you.

03:26:21.444 --> 03:26:25.698
Hurry up, Nicholas! You're delaying
the trip to the country!

03:26:49.305 --> 03:26:51.224
Pierre!

03:26:53.184 --> 03:26:58.231
We were so worried when we heard
you were taken prisoner.

03:27:00.066 --> 03:27:02.902
You've come back.

03:27:16.916 --> 03:27:19.419
You're like this house.

03:27:19.544 --> 03:27:24.841
You suffer, you show your wounds,
but you stand.
