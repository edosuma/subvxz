00:20.772 --> 00:21.756
Keep it in your pants.

00:21.795 --> 00:22.795
You're not gonna
need it.

00:22.862 --> 00:25.014
My heart's racing.

00:25.081 --> 00:26.632
Your heart's not racing?

00:26.699 --> 00:28.751
- No.
- Liar.

00:32.037 --> 00:33.605
Now my heart
is racing.

00:54.861 --> 00:59.198
Now my heart
is racing.

01:00.567 --> 01:03.152
Hey, what are you doing
down here?

01:03.219 --> 01:04.186
It's ok.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.871
Yeah, we're
police officers.

01:05.922 --> 01:08.957
22 years as a cop,
never fired my weapon.

01:09.042 --> 01:10.376
And now this.

01:10.427 --> 01:12.044
You two yum-yums
ain't cops.

01:14.130 --> 01:16.348
Joe, don't!

01:21.020 --> 01:22.921
Torres.

01:22.972 --> 01:24.523
The museum's just
been broken into

01:24.590 --> 01:26.275
and you are liable
for whatever's missing.

01:26.359 --> 01:28.060
What? How is this my fault?

01:28.111 --> 01:29.361
All I'm saying,
Miss Torres,

01:29.429 --> 01:30.946
is this better not
have anything to do

01:31.030 --> 01:33.332
with any of the people you
supposedly vetted.

01:35.368 --> 01:37.069
Us doing you a favor?

01:37.120 --> 01:38.904
He's blaming you,
Torres,

01:38.955 --> 01:41.407
that's exactly what
I would do in his place.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.418
Miss Torres,
I went to the Lightman Group

01:52.469 --> 01:53.836
and hired Dr. Lightman.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.289
All I got was you.
Thanks for nothing.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.724
Cop got shot?

01:58.791 --> 02:01.093
No, the thieves
dressed as a cop.

02:02.061 --> 02:03.295
How many thieves?

02:03.346 --> 02:04.313
Two.

02:04.397 --> 02:06.064
Other one's dead.

02:06.132 --> 02:08.434
Dr. Lightman,
good of you to show up.

02:09.485 --> 02:11.603
Always up for a party.

02:11.654 --> 02:13.589
What, do you
find this amusing?

02:13.656 --> 02:17.526
You hired us to vet
your staff and your security.

02:17.610 --> 02:20.112
And right now you're hoping
she messed up

02:20.163 --> 02:21.914
so you can blame this
on someone else.

02:21.981 --> 02:25.250
Amusing.
Laugh a minute.

02:25.318 --> 02:27.853
But you leave her alone!

02:34.010 --> 02:36.628
Hey, where are you going?

02:42.185 --> 02:44.136
At ease.
I'm a doctor.

02:52.395 --> 02:54.279
You in a lot of
pain, are you?

02:54.347 --> 02:57.199
What do you think?

02:57.283 --> 03:00.319
What were you trying to steal
from the museum?

03:00.370 --> 03:01.686
And who for?

03:04.958 --> 03:06.858
We got a man dying
here.

03:06.910 --> 03:09.161
Look around.
What do you see?

03:09.212 --> 03:11.463
I don't see
anyone else dying.

03:11.531 --> 03:12.831
You a doctor?

03:12.882 --> 03:14.550
He's a witness.

03:14.634 --> 03:16.969
A cop.
You got some id?

03:17.036 --> 03:17.920
So, are you just gonna
let him die, huh?

03:18.004 --> 03:20.305
No, I'm gonna call
security.

03:20.373 --> 03:21.840
That's what
I'm going to do.

03:21.891 --> 03:23.041
You know what I see?

03:23.092 --> 03:25.544
I see a woman who's
been in this game far too long,

03:25.595 --> 03:27.763
who's lost the ability
to serve.

03:27.847 --> 03:30.549
Excuse me.

03:32.602 --> 03:35.437
Right. She's gonna be
back in a minute,

03:35.522 --> 03:36.655
so make it snappy.

03:36.722 --> 03:38.357
Who are you?

03:38.408 --> 03:40.892
A fellow art lover.

03:40.944 --> 03:43.395
I'm partial to a bit
of Van Gogh.

03:43.446 --> 03:46.114
All the arts, artifacts.

03:46.199 --> 03:48.733
You know,
something small you can
slip in your pocket,

03:48.785 --> 03:52.254
walk out of a museum
with, you know,
disguised as a cop.

03:52.338 --> 03:55.340
I'll tell you this much.

03:55.408 --> 03:57.676
The item is pre-sold.

03:57.743 --> 03:59.294
The item?

03:59.379 --> 04:02.631
Yeah. Yeah, the item.
Sold to who?

04:02.715 --> 04:05.884
That's--that's all
I'm gonna say until I walk out of here.

04:05.935 --> 04:08.920
Want to cut a deal
against the people who hired you?

04:08.972 --> 04:11.523
How many are there?

04:12.758 --> 04:15.193
I guess I'm finally
getting what I deserve, huh?

04:15.261 --> 04:16.812
You hang in there.

04:16.896 --> 04:18.647
What for?

04:18.731 --> 04:19.764
Oh, don't be
a wanker.

04:19.815 --> 04:21.649
There must be

05:08.498 --> 05:10.916
Dr. Torres
dial 1182.

05:10.983 --> 05:15.087
Dr. Torres,
please dial 1182.

05:15.154 --> 05:17.789
Hey, thought
you could use some company.

05:20.493 --> 05:22.177
Cal?

05:22.261 --> 05:23.879
What'd you say?

05:27.433 --> 05:29.518
Never mind.
I can see you're busy.

05:29.602 --> 05:32.337
With her legs
or the case?

05:35.491 --> 05:37.643
Both.

05:39.195 --> 05:42.147
That obnoxious curator just hunted
me down at the vending machine.

05:42.198 --> 05:47.119
Sidney Carlton.
Now, that's either a fake name,

05:47.186 --> 05:49.071
or the man was born
a ponce.

05:49.155 --> 05:51.690
He was--he was screaming
at me that this is my fault.

05:51.741 --> 05:53.858
That I screwed up
vetting his staff.

05:53.910 --> 05:56.128
That the only reason
the thieves were at the museum

05:56.195 --> 05:59.631
was because someone there
had leaked where
the new art exhibit

05:59.699 --> 06:02.801
was being stored
and I missed it.

06:02.868 --> 06:05.137
You're blocking
the view, love.

06:08.508 --> 06:11.176
You know the difference
between...

06:11.227 --> 06:15.564
A monarch butterfly
and a viceroy, Torres?

06:15.648 --> 06:16.598
No.

06:16.666 --> 06:17.933
Well,
look at her.

06:18.017 --> 06:19.601
All right.
Go on.

06:19.686 --> 06:21.103
Off you go.

06:21.187 --> 06:23.238
What about you?

06:26.058 --> 06:27.743
Busy.

06:27.827 --> 06:29.394
Magazine?

06:30.697 --> 06:33.582
I'm good.
Thanks.

06:33.666 --> 06:36.034
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

06:38.955 --> 06:40.288
Is this taken?

06:40.373 --> 06:43.709
No.

06:49.215 --> 06:53.452
You a patient
or a visitor?

06:53.519 --> 06:56.021
I have a friend
in surgery.

06:59.992 --> 07:02.060
Is that man bothering you?

07:02.111 --> 07:03.562
Which man?

07:03.629 --> 07:05.430
Oh, the one that
was staring at you.

07:05.481 --> 07:07.716
You mean you?

07:07.784 --> 07:09.751
Oh, so you were
ignoring me, then.

07:09.819 --> 07:11.737
Are you hitting on me?

07:11.788 --> 07:13.905
Wait, in this place?

07:13.956 --> 07:17.492
It'd be a bit creepy,
wouldn't it?

07:19.796 --> 07:22.113
Is it a close friend?

07:22.165 --> 07:23.415
In surgery?

07:23.466 --> 07:25.116
Co-worker.

07:25.168 --> 07:26.752
He doesn't have family,

07:26.819 --> 07:30.055
so I thought--I thought
I should be here.

07:30.122 --> 07:32.924
More than just
a co-worker, then.

07:39.298 --> 07:42.484
Ok, how about you?
Patient or visitor?

07:42.568 --> 07:45.854
Visitor.
But it's a long story.

07:45.938 --> 07:48.406
Friend, relative?

07:48.474 --> 07:53.328
I don't know want
to burden you with my problems.

07:54.497 --> 07:56.915
Suit yourself.

07:58.034 --> 08:02.504
Right. Well, good-bye
and nice to meet you.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.925
Um, I didn't mean
to be rude.

08:06.992 --> 08:10.428
Please sit.

08:32.150 --> 08:34.953
Lovers tiff?

08:37.155 --> 08:39.707
Worse?

08:39.792 --> 08:43.328
That bad, eh?

08:49.252 --> 08:51.586
He didn't make it,
did he?

08:51.654 --> 08:53.922
I'm sorry.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.258
We did our best.

08:56.342 --> 08:58.910
There was too much
internal bleeding.

09:11.107 --> 09:13.942
Sorry.

09:15.778 --> 09:19.564
Mr. Carlton, Ria Torres
is very thorough.

09:19.615 --> 09:21.666
And she doesn't work for
you, she works for me.

09:21.734 --> 09:24.569
Those thieves knew exactly
where the new exhibit is being stored.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.404
They were shot
6 feet from it.

09:26.455 --> 09:28.406
Now, somebody at the museum
tipped them off.

09:28.457 --> 09:30.909
She interviewed
everyone there.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.410
Except you.

09:32.461 --> 09:34.930
What, are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

09:38.384 --> 09:39.634
What'd you find out?

09:39.719 --> 09:41.019
I already told you,

09:41.086 --> 09:43.688
the man died before Dr. Lightman could
get much out of him.

09:43.756 --> 09:45.390
Wait, not even what
they were there to steal?

09:45.441 --> 09:47.058
Well, my guess
would be art.

09:47.109 --> 09:48.760
The opening is this Friday.

09:48.811 --> 09:50.762
A black tie gala
fundraiser.

09:50.813 --> 09:53.531
Now, I need to know
there is no danger of a second attempt.

10:11.718 --> 10:12.918
Hey.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.359
I was just gonna check
if you're ok.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.913
This is my friend
Gill.

10:22.532 --> 10:23.883
Hi, Naomi.

10:23.968 --> 10:27.170
Hi.

10:27.221 --> 10:28.671
I was just leaving.

10:28.722 --> 10:32.642
Call me
if you need to.

10:36.363 --> 10:39.148
I feel terrible
for your loss.

10:39.216 --> 10:41.517
I was gonna offer
to buy you a cup of coffee.

10:41.569 --> 10:43.937
What about your friend,
co-worker?

10:44.021 --> 10:47.607
Routine surgery.
Nothing like what
you're dealing with.

10:47.691 --> 10:49.859
I've got a half hour.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.245
Ok.

10:54.498 --> 10:57.250
For the record,
this isn't how we first met.

10:57.334 --> 11:00.570
If anyone asks,
we met online.

11:00.638 --> 11:02.305
Someone's feeling
better.

11:02.373 --> 11:04.757
Can I ask how close
a relative that was?

11:04.842 --> 11:08.461
Well, it depends
what you mean by close.

11:08.545 --> 11:10.413
Is it possible,
just a little bit,

11:10.481 --> 11:12.966
that you're playing
the grief card with me?

11:13.050 --> 11:14.968
I resent that.

11:15.052 --> 11:17.753
Is it working?

11:17.805 --> 11:22.609
Naomi. Russel.

11:22.693 --> 11:24.143
Cal Lightman.

11:24.228 --> 11:25.645
Pleased to meet you,
Cal.

11:25.729 --> 11:27.430
Call me Lightman.

11:27.481 --> 11:30.917
And pleased to meet me,
that's an understatement,
that is.

11:30.985 --> 11:34.437
When I beat the other guy
to the seat next to you,

11:34.488 --> 11:36.656
you were relieved.
Who was he?

11:37.708 --> 11:40.443
Come on, I saw
that look in your eyes.

11:40.494 --> 11:41.777
What look?

11:41.829 --> 11:43.913
Fear.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.619
He's my ex-boyfriend.
Jack.

11:50.671 --> 11:52.322
What'd you do to him?

11:53.407 --> 11:56.259
Nothing. Why?

11:56.310 --> 11:58.561
'Cause he wants to hurt you.

12:00.014 --> 12:01.180
How do you know?

12:01.265 --> 12:04.684
And I don't think
it's over nothing, love.

12:06.937 --> 12:10.907
All right, well,
next time he shows his face...

12:12.693 --> 12:13.860
I want to know,
all right?

12:21.201 --> 12:22.502
Are you gonna
clue me in?

12:22.586 --> 12:25.088
In a fish tank!
What?

12:25.155 --> 12:27.323
Please, you weren't
really sleeping.

12:27.374 --> 12:31.344
I was in the middle
of a rather unusual dream.

12:31.428 --> 12:32.845
Was that woman in it?

12:32.930 --> 12:34.380
What woman?

12:37.885 --> 12:39.668
Interesting personality.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.220
I have no doubt.

12:41.305 --> 12:42.772
Tricky, though.

12:42.839 --> 12:44.507
Not to be trusted,

12:44.575 --> 12:46.109
but then, you know,
I like them th way.

12:46.176 --> 12:48.444
Know what I mean?
Mmm.

12:48.512 --> 12:51.698
Did you notice
anything odd

12:51.782 --> 12:55.368
about the janitor
who was mopping up
at the hospital?

12:58.855 --> 13:00.689
Have we given up knocking?

13:00.741 --> 13:01.958
This is important.

13:02.025 --> 13:04.060
I've been doing some checking into
the museum staff.

13:04.128 --> 13:05.828
The museum repaints
before every new exhibit,

13:05.879 --> 13:07.296
and they always use
the same guys.

13:07.364 --> 13:10.717
No id tag.
The janitor.

13:12.702 --> 13:13.720
Really?

13:13.804 --> 13:15.054
Is that what you're
talking about?

13:15.139 --> 13:19.041
No. My thing was
more a feeling thing,

13:19.093 --> 13:21.978
you know, but
your thing's better.

13:22.046 --> 13:23.846
Better?

13:26.350 --> 13:28.884
Get your helmet on,
Loker.

13:30.387 --> 13:32.721
Never crossed
your mind, Torres.

13:32.773 --> 13:34.390
Temporary employees
at the museum ever
cross your mind?

13:34.441 --> 13:35.891
What are you
talking about?

13:35.943 --> 13:37.110
Loker?

13:37.194 --> 13:38.444
I found 2 painters
who fixed the place up

13:38.529 --> 13:39.462
before every exhibit.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.230
The curator never
mentioned that.

13:41.281 --> 13:43.116
I called both men in.

13:44.401 --> 13:46.586
Thank you, Loker.

13:48.038 --> 13:50.739
Did you look up
those 2 butterflies
that I told you about?

13:52.376 --> 13:53.926
The monarch and the viceroy.
Did you look them up?

13:53.994 --> 13:56.929
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
they're nearly identical.

13:57.014 --> 13:58.765
A predator can't tell
the difference between them.

13:58.849 --> 14:00.116
All he knows is
one of them's toxic,

14:00.184 --> 14:01.917
so he leaves them
both alone.

14:07.191 --> 14:08.441
So, do you get it, then?

14:08.525 --> 14:09.776
Get what?

14:09.860 --> 14:12.278
If someone like that
ponce at the museum

14:12.362 --> 14:15.148
takes a bit out of you,
you make sure he regrets it.

14:15.232 --> 14:17.316
Ok?

14:17.401 --> 14:18.868
Well, off you trot, then.

14:18.935 --> 14:21.954
The 2 painters
Loker dragged in.

14:22.039 --> 14:24.373
Sometime this year
would be nice.

14:26.994 --> 14:29.462
Who's Naomi?

14:31.582 --> 14:35.384
So, no work permit, Mr. Garcia?

14:39.890 --> 14:42.258
I love this country.

14:42.309 --> 14:44.460
If only they'd
make you legal.

14:44.511 --> 14:45.978
Is this about the robbery?

14:51.518 --> 14:52.652
Nervous tick.

14:52.719 --> 14:55.638
People from some
latin cultures
kiss their thumbs

14:55.689 --> 14:58.641
and then flick them
as a swearing gesture.

14:58.692 --> 15:00.526
Like he swears
he didn't do it.

15:00.611 --> 15:03.396
Mr. Garcia, there's something else
you're not telling me.

15:05.949 --> 15:08.034
Kiss? That looks more
like a bite.

15:35.696 --> 15:37.146
Ok.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.515
Ok, Mr. Garcia.
Thank you for your time.

15:39.566 --> 15:43.486
We're looking
for thieves, not family men.

15:43.537 --> 15:46.021
Open the door.
I just want to talk to you.

15:46.073 --> 15:48.207
Open the door!
I just want to talk to you!

15:48.292 --> 15:49.525
Come on, Naomi.

15:49.576 --> 15:51.193
Is this how you
treat me, huh?

15:51.245 --> 15:52.628
Open the door!
Hey!

15:55.031 --> 15:56.549
First the hospital,

15:56.633 --> 15:58.701
now you're parked up
at her building.

15:58.752 --> 16:01.087
What kind of a man
are you, eh?

16:19.556 --> 16:22.358
You got fabulous
taste in men.

16:24.361 --> 16:27.179
This is far
from over, love.

16:29.026 --> 16:30.226
Your ex has got
government plates.

16:31.165 --> 16:33.332
Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.001
Did you report him?

16:35.085 --> 16:38.971
I don't know why
I'm so cold.

16:39.056 --> 16:44.477
So, you want to
ask me out?

16:44.545 --> 16:47.480
Can we go somewhere else?

16:56.857 --> 16:58.775
Yeah, maybe
you're right.

16:58.826 --> 17:01.010
Maybe you are
smarter than me.

17:01.078 --> 17:03.579
You go to college?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.330
Carnegie Mellon.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.032
But you didn't
graduate.

17:07.117 --> 17:08.935
Didn't need to.

17:09.002 --> 17:10.670
Because that would
be beneath you.

17:10.753 --> 17:12.204
I'm an artist.

17:12.271 --> 17:13.839
You paint walls.

17:13.924 --> 17:16.675
Einstein was
a patent clerk.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.628
Yeah.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.464
I know what you mean.

17:21.515 --> 17:23.598
I was a TSA screener.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.968
No college.

17:26.019 --> 17:28.221
Yeah.

17:28.305 --> 17:30.640
You know why
you're here?

17:30.691 --> 17:34.393
To do with
the attempted robbery
last night.

17:40.451 --> 17:44.186
Ask the curator why
he keeps ordering town cars

17:44.238 --> 17:47.824
and goes out to pay
the guy in cash,

17:47.875 --> 17:50.526
but never gets in the car.

17:50.577 --> 17:52.845
The curator?

17:52.913 --> 17:55.364
Sidney Carlton.

18:01.221 --> 18:02.705
Hey, where's Lightman?

18:02.756 --> 18:05.258
Um, not here.

18:05.342 --> 18:06.843
You should try
his office.

18:06.894 --> 18:08.544
What?

18:08.595 --> 18:11.046
What are you hiding?

18:15.569 --> 18:16.769
He had me put
a hidden camera

18:16.854 --> 18:19.021
on those 2 painters
in the lobby.

18:19.072 --> 18:20.890
He wanted to see what they did when
no one was watching.

18:20.941 --> 18:23.409
You guys used me
as a decoy?

18:23.494 --> 18:25.444
He planted a catalogue
of the upcoming museum exhibit

18:25.529 --> 18:26.896
on the coffee table.

18:26.964 --> 18:29.699
I thought he wanted you
out of the lab.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.784
Just watch, ok?

18:31.869 --> 18:36.172
Because, like, you can't
see what I can see.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.059
See how he flips
through the pages like
he couldn't care less?

18:40.127 --> 18:43.312
Like he's looking through
an issue of "cat lover."

18:43.380 --> 18:44.430
Ahem.

18:44.515 --> 18:46.766
You're a cat lover?

18:47.701 --> 18:49.468
And I had you down
for a poodle.

18:49.553 --> 18:53.022
But your other painter...

18:53.089 --> 18:55.474
He's taking
his time,

18:55.559 --> 18:57.944
soaking up
the images.

19:01.648 --> 19:03.032
Yeah, you see that?

19:04.818 --> 19:08.103
Turns to
a specific page,
then quickly moves on.

19:08.155 --> 19:10.540
He's seen it before.

19:10.607 --> 19:11.707
He doesn't need
to see it again.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.993
He's interested
in something on that page.

19:14.077 --> 19:16.379
And they're going to
go back for it.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.781
He's your inside man.

19:20.133 --> 19:22.451
Still think
I should be fired?

19:23.871 --> 19:27.957
An Egyptian statue of Osiris
and an emerald from India.

19:28.025 --> 19:29.625
So what,
in your opinion,

19:29.676 --> 19:30.943
is the most
important piece

19:31.011 --> 19:33.012
in this new exhibit?

19:33.096 --> 19:35.348
Well, the statue of Osiris
without a doubt.

19:35.432 --> 19:38.484
Why pay cash for
a town car you never
actually use?

19:39.937 --> 19:42.304
What's the money for?
Catnip?

19:49.696 --> 19:52.314
You're divorced,
you have a teenage
daughter,

19:52.366 --> 19:53.666
and you cook.

19:53.750 --> 19:57.320
Well, call me Mr. right.

19:57.387 --> 19:58.871
But enough about me.

19:58.939 --> 20:03.209
What would I have found
if you had invited me
up to your place?

20:03.293 --> 20:05.595
Aside from
the bad housekeeping,

20:05.662 --> 20:07.680
I'm about as vanilla
as they come.

20:09.349 --> 20:11.367
Want a bite?

20:11.435 --> 20:14.437
That's the third time
you've offered.

20:15.639 --> 20:18.107
Maybe I wasn't
talking about food.

20:18.174 --> 20:23.029
Flirting while scared.
That's unusual.

20:30.353 --> 20:32.855
Is your ex still
on your mind?

20:34.241 --> 20:35.291
You know,
this is kind of a drag.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.627
I can't seem to hide
anything from you.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.795
You don't want.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.131
You just don't know it yet.

20:42.198 --> 20:48.421
This is like a therapy session in
the middle of a police interrogation.

20:48.488 --> 20:50.673
That's my idea
of foreplay.

20:50.724 --> 20:53.542
Well, when I'm getting
to know a man,

20:53.593 --> 20:55.761
I like to put
my best foot forward.

20:55.829 --> 20:57.630
You're not letting me.

20:57.698 --> 20:59.482
You're not listening.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.486
I'm all ears, I am.
Trust me on that.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.638
And eyes.

21:05.706 --> 21:07.440
And the rest.

21:09.576 --> 21:13.412
Don't call it foreplay
if you don't mean it.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.904
Ahem.

21:21.955 --> 21:24.373
Way to make a girl
feel special.

21:24.424 --> 21:28.010
Oh, you don't need me
to tell you
you're special, love.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.079
You already know it.

21:33.016 --> 21:36.302
Mr. Carlton, do you have
a drug problem?

21:37.554 --> 21:39.488
But you have it
under control.

21:41.575 --> 21:44.694
So what the painter saw
was you paying your dealing.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.095
And you know
he saw you,

21:46.146 --> 21:47.530
which is why you failed
to mention him

21:47.597 --> 21:49.982
when I was screening
your staff.

21:50.067 --> 21:51.617
What's this got to do
with the attempted robbery?

21:51.702 --> 21:54.153
The thief,
before he died,

21:54.237 --> 21:57.323
said there was already
a buy for something in the collection.

21:57.407 --> 22:00.876
I bet that statue
buys a whole lot of drugs.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.277
Now wait a minute.

22:02.329 --> 22:05.765
Even if I was a thief,
I wouldn't steal from my own museum.

22:05.832 --> 22:08.801
This exhibit is
a game changer for me.

22:08.885 --> 22:10.636
Now, focus on
the real suspects,

22:10.721 --> 22:13.305
not some recreational
drug user.

22:15.225 --> 22:17.009
He was telling the truth.

22:17.094 --> 22:19.662
Except the
recreational part.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.330
Why am I here?

22:21.398 --> 22:23.799
Well, I seem to remember
coming to your rescue.

22:23.867 --> 22:25.801
You barely know me.

22:25.869 --> 22:27.853
That's the way I like it.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.057
Relationships
scare you.

22:31.124 --> 22:33.292
Well, we all have
our weaknesses, darling.

22:36.580 --> 22:39.281
Tell me.

22:39.332 --> 22:41.751
Scientifically--

22:41.818 --> 22:42.952
yes.

22:43.003 --> 22:45.504
You haven't heard
the question yet.

22:45.589 --> 22:47.823
Am I attracted to you?

22:47.891 --> 22:50.826
Well?

22:50.877 --> 22:53.512
All right, for you,

22:53.597 --> 22:57.550
scientifically speaking,

22:57.634 --> 22:59.051
your breathing's shallow,

22:59.136 --> 23:01.503
your pupils are dilated.

23:01.555 --> 23:03.606
You want me to carry on,
do you?

23:16.036 --> 23:18.854
I have a habit of
jumping into things
too quickly.

23:18.905 --> 23:20.406
Well, if it's
a gentleman you're after,

23:20.490 --> 23:22.208
you're in
the wrong house, love.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.421
Hold that thought.

23:35.505 --> 23:37.223
Oh.

23:45.398 --> 23:48.184
Bang.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.189
Breaking and entering.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.158
Another day, another dollar
working for the government.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.394
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

23:59.446 --> 24:02.781
Immigration
and CEstoms enforcement.

24:02.866 --> 24:04.700
ICE.

24:04.751 --> 24:07.369
It's tough sounding.

24:13.409 --> 24:15.511
Oh, yeah.

24:15.578 --> 24:18.597
I've seen that look before.

24:18.682 --> 24:20.349
On my ex-wife's face.

24:22.686 --> 24:25.938
You really did a number
on this one, darling.

24:26.022 --> 24:28.107
He came here
to use this.

24:29.309 --> 24:31.026
You' crazy.

24:32.028 --> 24:34.313
Easy, tiger.

24:34.397 --> 24:36.649
What have you been
saying about me?

24:36.733 --> 24:39.235
Look at her face.

24:39.286 --> 24:42.437
She's terrified
of you.

24:42.489 --> 24:44.790
What do you think
she's been saying?

24:46.493 --> 24:48.210
Get out.

24:49.779 --> 24:53.215
I'm wondering
what it is you're
really after.

24:53.283 --> 24:58.888
I'm wondering why the world's leading
deception expert

24:58.955 --> 25:02.808
can't see the world's
biggest liar...

25:05.295 --> 25:07.596
When she's right under
his nose.

25:19.826 --> 25:21.994
Anything to add?

25:22.078 --> 25:25.981
When you said you were
crazy for me,

25:26.032 --> 25:28.000
was that the truth?

25:28.084 --> 25:33.488
I have the habit
of jumping into things

25:33.540 --> 25:36.353
too quick.

25:46.156 --> 25:48.758
Try not to be so hard
on yourself, Ria.

25:48.825 --> 25:52.661
We can't see everything
all the time.

25:52.713 --> 25:55.131
Is Lightman giving you
a hard time?

26:02.122 --> 26:04.506
A retired cop,

26:04.558 --> 26:06.559
who had never fired
his weapon,

26:06.643 --> 26:10.129
kills 2 men 'cause
I dropped the ball.

26:13.433 --> 26:15.868
It's my fault.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.791
You get my message?

26:24.861 --> 26:26.746
Uh-oh.
The painter should be here

26:26.830 --> 26:28.881
any second. Loker's
waiting in the lobby.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.033
We told him that you were
interested in his art.

26:31.084 --> 26:32.919
Right. Well, she's
in the loo.

26:33.003 --> 26:35.304
So, do your worst.

26:42.846 --> 26:44.546
Were you two
talking about me?

26:44.598 --> 26:47.149
You're all we ever talk about.
You know that.

26:48.235 --> 26:49.685
Anything juicy?

26:49.736 --> 26:52.271
Torres is upset.
She thinks she messed up.

26:52.356 --> 26:54.106
Well, as well
she should be.

26:54.191 --> 26:55.942
I told her
you'd understand.

26:56.026 --> 26:57.610
Good news.
Oh?

26:57.694 --> 27:01.447
My new bird is
trying to play me.

27:01.531 --> 27:03.232
How is that good news?

27:03.283 --> 27:04.900
I'm still working
on that part.

27:04.952 --> 27:06.953
You're working on it.
For both of us?

27:07.037 --> 27:09.538
See? I told you
it was good news.

27:10.424 --> 27:12.124
Oh.

27:12.192 --> 27:15.211
Hi.
You're the woman from--

27:15.262 --> 27:18.047
the woman from the hospital.
Your boss is helping me out.

27:18.098 --> 27:20.082
With what?

27:20.133 --> 27:21.750
I'm sorry.
That's confidential.

27:21.802 --> 27:23.719
It's just--we share
all information here,

27:23.770 --> 27:25.388
like one big, happy family.

27:25.439 --> 27:27.056
Even personal
information.

27:27.107 --> 27:28.891
You said he was helping you out,

27:28.959 --> 27:32.228
so I made the leap to it,
being related to
the work we do here.

27:32.279 --> 27:35.114
It's kind of personal.

27:35.198 --> 27:36.866
Well, that explains it.

27:36.933 --> 27:39.768
It's just that
he's been acting distracted.

27:41.038 --> 27:43.122
Oh, no.
That's a good thing.

27:43.206 --> 27:45.992
Oh.

27:47.444 --> 27:49.445
Hey.

27:57.638 --> 28:00.172
Well, she's into you.
That part seems genuine.

28:00.257 --> 28:03.259
That's not what
I sent you in there for.

28:03.310 --> 28:05.394
I didn't see anything.

28:05.462 --> 28:07.013
Foster said that you want
to make amends

28:07.097 --> 28:08.597
'cause you screwed up
at the museum.

28:08.649 --> 28:12.134
My gut says
that you're right.
She's hiding something.

28:12.185 --> 28:13.352
Oi.

28:16.306 --> 28:19.475
Everyone screws up
now and then, love.

28:31.288 --> 28:34.256
This is al Larson,
the painter from
the Parker museum.

28:34.324 --> 28:36.175
Painter, eh?

28:36.259 --> 28:39.261
I paint the walls.

28:41.465 --> 28:44.016
Proper artist, then.
Yeah.

28:44.101 --> 28:47.803
Loker, why don't you take
mistress Naomi to my office?

28:47.854 --> 28:49.855
I'll be along later.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.857
With me, Pablo.

28:54.511 --> 28:56.445
I like to work
in acrylics.

28:56.513 --> 28:58.981
And I do
limited edition prints.

28:59.032 --> 29:01.016
And art theft.

29:01.068 --> 29:04.537
Surely you don't want
anyone else to get killed.

29:06.073 --> 29:08.524
You're talented.
How much?

29:08.575 --> 29:10.743
You used my art
to get me in here.

29:10.827 --> 29:12.545
No, I'm serious.

29:12.629 --> 29:15.197
Crime shouldn't pay,
but this bloody well should.

29:15.248 --> 29:16.916
You know what they say.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.551
When life gives you lemons--

29:18.635 --> 29:20.536
Chuck 'em at people.

29:20.587 --> 29:22.704
That's what I do, anyway.
This is what you do.

29:22.756 --> 29:24.557
You don't kill people.

29:24.641 --> 29:26.592
Who said I had anything to do
with that?
I did.

29:26.676 --> 29:28.761
And you did, too.

29:31.565 --> 29:35.017
And you're not proud of it,
are you? This is what
you're proud of.

29:37.404 --> 29:40.322
I didn't know
anyone would die.

29:42.192 --> 29:44.944
What about Naomi?

29:45.028 --> 29:47.363
Did she know, eh?

29:49.533 --> 29:52.218
I know you know her.

29:54.737 --> 29:57.173
I met Naomi with
the 2 guys who were killed.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.292
One of whom died
at the hospital.
She was there for him.

30:00.377 --> 30:02.378
She didn't have anything
to do with the heist.

30:02.446 --> 30:04.380
She tell you that,
did she?

30:04.431 --> 30:06.132
The first mention of guns,
she was out.

30:06.216 --> 30:08.217
She doesn't work like that.

30:08.268 --> 30:12.138
She knew
the museum hired me.

30:12.205 --> 30:14.056
That's how she works.

30:16.226 --> 30:18.694
She got to you.

30:18.761 --> 30:20.396
Didn't she?

30:23.933 --> 30:25.851
Who mentioned guns?

30:25.919 --> 30:29.104
All I know is,
they had a thing.

30:29.172 --> 30:31.907
And he's having a hard time
letting go.

30:35.328 --> 30:37.596
Is this what they were
trying to steal?

30:37.664 --> 30:40.249
Probably both.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.885
Rude not to, really.

30:50.844 --> 30:52.294
Can I go now?

30:52.345 --> 30:54.163
Nope.

30:54.231 --> 30:56.965
There's only one way
I don't call the cops.

31:07.027 --> 31:09.078
That's the guy
from the hospital.

31:09.145 --> 31:10.996
Yep.
That's Naomi's ex.

31:11.081 --> 31:13.199
Naomi's part of the crew?

31:13.283 --> 31:15.835
No. Her fear of him
is so raw, it's real.

31:15.919 --> 31:18.654
She's working against
him. She's using me
to take him out.

31:18.705 --> 31:21.823
Mm-hmm. Before he
shuts her up for good.

31:24.177 --> 31:26.011
You got played.

31:27.347 --> 31:29.682
Would that make you
feel better about
your mistake?

31:29.766 --> 31:32.334
Mm-hmm. A little.

31:33.770 --> 31:36.505
When one of the most
beautiful women
I've ever seen, right,

31:36.556 --> 31:38.507
lets me eyeball her,
unchecked,

31:38.558 --> 31:42.361
and then lets me
hit on her, at will--

31:42.445 --> 31:44.613
no, I never smelled a rat.

31:46.066 --> 31:47.483
Call the cops on these two.

31:47.534 --> 31:49.017
What about Naomi?

31:49.069 --> 31:50.486
Oh, no, don't be daft.

31:50.537 --> 31:52.854
I'm not even half done
with her yet.

31:56.376 --> 31:58.627
I had your ex
arrested today.

31:58.695 --> 32:00.412
Because of me?

32:00.497 --> 32:03.031
Well, it turns out...

32:03.083 --> 32:06.201
He's using his job at customs
to move stolen art.

32:06.253 --> 32:08.020
Stolen art?

32:08.088 --> 32:10.639
Oh, bollocks.
You knew. Be honest.

32:12.809 --> 32:14.977
I knew he was
up to something.

32:16.479 --> 32:18.180
I know you're happy.

32:18.231 --> 32:22.518
Heh. Can we
call it relieved?

32:24.154 --> 32:26.488
I was hoping...

32:26.556 --> 32:28.724
You'd want to celebrate.

32:30.493 --> 32:32.328
Now?

32:35.031 --> 32:38.617
Would it be too old school
if I asked for a date first?

32:38.702 --> 32:40.703
Uh, wow.

32:40.754 --> 32:42.421
Oh, really, no, relax.

32:42.505 --> 32:45.007
I'm just the same as
most of the wankers out there.

32:45.074 --> 32:48.127
It's just that I'm tired
of making the same mistake
over and over again.

32:48.194 --> 32:50.963
You know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.

32:51.047 --> 32:54.016
Parker Museum is having
a posh do tomorrow night.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.118
You up for it?

32:56.186 --> 32:58.520
I don't have a dress.

32:58.588 --> 33:00.122
Oh.

33:00.190 --> 33:01.890
That suits me.

33:16.473 --> 33:18.673
Champagne at 12 o'clock.

33:20.226 --> 33:22.945
Do you know much about
Egyptian art there?

33:23.012 --> 33:26.615
I know when
something's beautiful.

33:28.151 --> 33:29.518
And pricey.

33:29.569 --> 33:32.237
Beauty and cost
don't always go hand in hand.

33:41.498 --> 33:43.882
You know, I could never
quite understand

33:43.967 --> 33:46.251
what art saw in commerce.

33:46.336 --> 33:49.805
You know, most artists
will tell you that
starving is overrated.

33:49.872 --> 33:52.558
Well, I bet the bloke
in India who made this

33:52.642 --> 33:55.194
could use the 3 mill
it's worth today.

33:55.261 --> 33:57.179
That's just a rock.

34:00.183 --> 34:02.100
Hi.

34:03.319 --> 34:05.070
Naomi,
you remember Torres.

34:05.154 --> 34:06.688
Ria.
Hi again.

34:06.739 --> 34:08.440
Rental?

34:08.525 --> 34:09.724
Stole it.

34:09.775 --> 34:11.944
You know, I'll go
nab those drinks.

34:12.027 --> 34:13.612
Amongst
other things.

34:13.696 --> 34:17.732
You mean
you want a sausage
on a stick as well?

34:19.735 --> 34:22.237
You like my butterfly?

34:22.288 --> 34:24.072
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

34:32.297 --> 34:35.417
You know,
at the hospital,

34:35.467 --> 34:38.904
she went out of her way
to avoid eye contact
with the janitor.

34:38.972 --> 34:41.690
She knew.

34:41.757 --> 34:43.859
Right.

34:43.926 --> 34:47.362
Keep an eye out
for a man

34:47.429 --> 34:50.866
in his late sixties
with white hair.

35:00.610 --> 35:02.461
Thank u.

35:02.545 --> 35:04.830
Where's my drink?

35:04.914 --> 35:06.832
Here. All yours.

35:06.916 --> 35:08.750
Thank you very much.

35:17.310 --> 35:18.727
You're staring.

35:18.794 --> 35:21.730
It's just
I don't want to let you
out of my sight, darling.

35:23.232 --> 35:25.651
I like that.

35:25.735 --> 35:27.319
If this is going
to work out,

35:27.403 --> 35:29.404
we have to
allow each other
some alone time.

35:29.472 --> 35:32.307
Oh, we both know
this isn't going
to work out, love.

35:36.479 --> 35:38.747
Well, then,
before our romance ends,

35:38.814 --> 35:42.651
can you grab us
another glass
of champagne?

35:54.797 --> 35:57.432
Old white people
all look alike.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.000
You just
figured that out?

36:10.446 --> 36:11.813
Wow.

36:11.864 --> 36:14.866
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you're surprised
to see me.

36:14.951 --> 36:17.202
No. I mean,

36:17.286 --> 36:19.021
wow.

36:19.088 --> 36:20.355
You scrub up well.

36:20.423 --> 36:22.741
Thank you.

36:36.806 --> 36:40.308
That was a good-bye kiss
if ever I had one.

36:45.481 --> 36:47.315
Another?

37:06.235 --> 37:07.402
Have we met?

37:07.453 --> 37:09.671
That's your best line?

37:09.739 --> 37:10.922
Dance, Ginger?

37:11.007 --> 37:12.290
There's no music.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.743
Who needs music?

37:14.794 --> 37:17.412
Have you been drinking?

37:17.463 --> 37:18.913
Not enough.

37:18.965 --> 37:20.799
Oh!

37:30.643 --> 37:33.145
It's the Congressman.
Someone call an ambulance.

37:37.650 --> 37:39.901
He's been drugged.
He'll get over it.

37:42.655 --> 37:44.706
The statue!

38:00.006 --> 38:01.840
She got it.
I don't believe it.

38:01.924 --> 38:03.792
How is that possible?

38:03.843 --> 38:06.178
It's not.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.162
Guess what's in my purse?

38:53.214 --> 38:56.599
It's not green,
and it's not a rock.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.470
Tell me
it's not about money.

39:00.521 --> 39:03.556
This isn't about money.

39:04.892 --> 39:06.226
Ok. Tell me that again.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.361
Why?

39:08.446 --> 39:12.615
'Cause with your face,
it's hard for me to do what I usually do.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.237
This isn't about money.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.206
The emerald is from
Kali's Temple in--

39:20.291 --> 39:22.375
I read the catalog
description, love.

39:22.460 --> 39:26.045
Archaeologists smuggled it out
of India in 1908.

39:26.130 --> 39:30.467
It vanished, only to reappear in 1975
on the open market.

39:30.534 --> 39:34.053
So he's taking it home,
is he?

39:35.723 --> 39:37.707
I know I lied to you.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.978
Technically speaking.

39:42.045 --> 39:44.881
You just scared
of Jack, huh?

39:47.434 --> 39:49.886
We were partners.

39:49.937 --> 39:53.556
He got tired
of the Robin Hood act.

39:53.607 --> 39:55.575
Time to make a buck.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.494
I split.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.282
He couldn't take no
for an answer.

40:04.401 --> 40:08.237
'Cause of Jack,

40:08.289 --> 40:10.857
my friends got killed.

40:14.795 --> 40:16.913
When did you know?

40:16.964 --> 40:18.915
Well, all I knew was,

40:18.983 --> 40:22.585
that like
most beautiful things,

40:22.636 --> 40:24.404
you wanted to be seen.

40:24.471 --> 40:28.308
I didn't want
any other people to die.

40:28.392 --> 40:31.060
You could have got rid
of Jack another way.

40:33.948 --> 40:36.316
Maybe I wanted to play

40:36.400 --> 40:40.787
with the world's greatest
deception expert.

40:43.490 --> 40:46.442
Never crossed my mind

40:46.493 --> 40:50.046
that you were a decoy.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.549
You won.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.485
Well done.
I mean that.

40:55.553 --> 40:58.972
I needed to get
into the gala,

40:59.056 --> 41:02.141
or the emerald
never returns
to India,

41:02.226 --> 41:05.595
its rightful owner.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.600
You want to have dinner?

41:13.136 --> 41:15.188
A viceroy butterfly.

41:15.272 --> 41:18.308
What does that mean?

41:36.093 --> 41:38.544
FBI want to ask you
some questions.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.496
Oh, yeah?

41:40.564 --> 41:43.049
Do you know
where she is?

41:45.836 --> 41:48.671
Long gone by now,
I should think.

41:48.722 --> 41:51.724
I gave her time
to disappear.

41:51.809 --> 41:54.560
I had
to turn down...

41:54.645 --> 41:56.145
Dinner.

42:00.034 --> 42:01.985
It wasn't theirs
to take.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.287
They didn't get it.

42:05.322 --> 42:07.790
What haven't you
told me?

42:07.858 --> 42:10.627
Well,
I didn't actually...

42:12.463 --> 42:16.165
Get to tell you
how beautiful you looked
last night.

42:16.216 --> 42:18.167
You're so irritating.

42:20.304 --> 42:22.005
They stole a fake.

42:24.141 --> 42:25.892
A fake?

42:25.976 --> 42:28.928
I had the curator
switch out the real one.

42:29.013 --> 42:31.514
Why?

42:31.565 --> 42:34.100
Well, the real one's
worth about...

42:34.184 --> 42:36.769
3 million-ish.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.438
The fake cost
just under 100.

42:38.522 --> 42:41.774
No. I mean, why keep me
in the dark about that?

42:41.859 --> 42:47.864
It's cat and mouse,
Gill,

42:47.915 --> 42:51.000
not cats and mouse.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.087
That's what
you're calling this?

42:54.171 --> 42:58.007
Tell me we're ok.

43:00.010 --> 43:04.580
You know I've always had
more trouble reading you
than anyone else.
