00:01.685 --> 00:03.019
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:03.052 --> 00:04.821
My name is Hannibal Lecter.

00:04.854 --> 00:06.823
Do you plan to argue insanity?

00:06.856 --> 00:10.094
You murdered and ate
three people, Mr. Lecter.

00:10.127 --> 00:11.060
O'MALLEY: I didn't kill them.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.962
The other man killed them.

00:12.996 --> 00:15.565
MAN: He has never denied
consuming the victims,

00:15.599 --> 00:18.034
but it's always the other
persona who stabbed the girls.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.236
Hello, Clarice.

00:19.536 --> 00:20.870
Does Bobby know?

00:20.904 --> 00:21.805
Does he know what?

00:21.838 --> 00:23.473
That you're in love with me.

00:23.773 --> 00:24.941
Instead of persecuting me,

00:24.974 --> 00:26.243
you should be looking for him,

00:26.276 --> 00:29.846
especially since
he's planning to kill Clarice.

00:29.879 --> 00:31.348
DOLE: I got stabbed
two years ago.

00:31.381 --> 00:32.849
A man stuck a knife
into me three times.

00:32.882 --> 00:35.819
I have never gone back
to being okay,

00:35.852 --> 00:38.422
no matter how much
that you insist that I have!

00:38.455 --> 00:41.491
MAN: We find the defendant,
Lawrence O'Malley, not guilty.

00:42.192 --> 00:44.628
GAMBLE: What I'd like to do
is get him civilly committed.

00:44.661 --> 00:46.463
I need you to testify
against him.

00:46.496 --> 00:47.997
Just get him,

00:48.031 --> 00:50.367
and if he resists,
shoot him.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.401
He's a cannibal,

00:51.435 --> 00:53.036
and he has
made it clear

00:53.069 --> 00:54.538
that he is coming after me!

00:54.571 --> 00:56.206
The petition is denied.

00:57.174 --> 00:59.543
Come near me,
I'll kill you.

01:00.544 --> 01:02.078
(door bell rings)

01:04.147 --> 01:05.114
O'MALLEY: You'll go to heaven,

01:05.149 --> 01:07.016
and I will
take you there myself.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.219
Why don't you go on ahead
without me?

01:09.253 --> 01:10.420
(gunshot)

01:10.454 --> 01:11.255
Lindsay!

01:17.761 --> 01:18.795
DOLE: I told you--

01:18.828 --> 01:21.731
I wasn't gonna go
through it again.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.736
(music playing)

01:57.066 --> 01:58.802
WOMAN (over phone): 911.
Is this an emergency?

01:58.835 --> 02:00.737
Yes, it is.

02:00.770 --> 02:02.139
A man has been shot.

02:02.172 --> 02:03.873
It may be fatal.

02:03.907 --> 02:05.008
My name is Robert Donnell.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.310
WOMAN (over phone):
Slow down, sir.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.777
I'm not speaking
very fast, ma'am.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.747
The address is 1312
Beacon Street.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.849
WOMAN (over phone):
There's a gunshot victim?

02:12.882 --> 02:14.083
Yes.

02:14.118 --> 02:17.221
We need an ambulance
right away at 1312 Beacon.

02:17.254 --> 02:18.888
WOMAN (over phone):
And who shot the man?

02:21.125 --> 02:23.059
A man has been shot.

02:23.093 --> 02:26.330
Please get an ambulance
to 1312 Beacon.

02:27.464 --> 02:28.465
(beeps)

02:30.567 --> 02:33.570
(music playing)

02:41.178 --> 02:42.312
You okay?

02:43.046 --> 02:44.881
Yes.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.250
Is he dead?

02:48.352 --> 02:49.453
I think so.

02:51.221 --> 02:53.123
Did I kill him?

02:58.728 --> 03:01.731
(music playing)

03:47.211 --> 03:48.978
(sirens wailing)

03:49.012 --> 03:51.014
(tires screeching)

04:01.791 --> 04:03.460
O'Malley?

04:03.493 --> 04:04.828
Three shots.

04:05.829 --> 04:06.530
Where are they?

04:06.563 --> 04:07.731
In the bedroom.

04:07.764 --> 04:09.299
There's an army in there.

04:17.374 --> 04:18.074
What happened?

04:18.975 --> 04:20.410
We need
a few minutes, please.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.113
Everybody here okay?

04:27.050 --> 04:28.952
We need
a few minutes, please.

04:29.486 --> 04:32.256
This room is considered
part of the crime scene.

04:32.289 --> 04:33.757
The police will need
to come in.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.160
No crime was committed.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.462
Please give us two minutes
and we'll be out.

04:47.571 --> 04:49.139
Okay, there is no way
you talk.

04:49.173 --> 04:50.540
FRUTT: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:50.574 --> 04:53.710
I know conventional wisdom says
don't talk, but here,

04:53.743 --> 04:55.412
given our relationship
with Helen?

04:55.445 --> 04:57.114
Helen can't cut this off.

04:57.147 --> 04:59.883
FRUTT: Look, this is exactly
the kind of scenario

04:59.916 --> 05:02.152
where the conclusion tends
to follow the assumption.

05:02.186 --> 05:03.420
If we don't cooperate,

05:03.453 --> 05:05.389
the assumption will be
possible murder.

05:05.422 --> 05:07.324
YOUNG: The man was unarmed,
three gunshots.

05:07.357 --> 05:08.658
They're gonna be thinking crime.

05:08.692 --> 05:10.026
FRUTT: Possibly, and if
we don't talk, definitely.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.628
Everybody shut up!

05:16.266 --> 05:17.867
This is what we're gonna do,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.068
she's in some shock.

05:19.103 --> 05:20.204
She needs medical attention.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.771
We need to get her
to a doctor now.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.440
That'll give us some time.

05:23.473 --> 05:24.741
We can take this time

05:24.774 --> 05:27.244
and go over
what we'll give them.

05:27.277 --> 05:28.345
Are we clear?

05:29.846 --> 05:31.481
I'll get you admitted
to the hospital.

05:31.515 --> 05:32.882
You'll stay there tonight.

05:32.916 --> 05:33.817
Bobby, you'll stay with her.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.285
We'll have your clothes sent.

05:35.319 --> 05:38.054
When you check out tomorrow,
you come directly to the office.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.323
I'll have security
at your room.

05:39.356 --> 05:42.226
Other than the doctor,

05:42.259 --> 05:43.693
you'll talk to nobody.

05:44.361 --> 05:46.596
Now, say absolutely nothing
on our way out.

05:46.630 --> 05:47.564
I'll talk with Walsh,

05:47.597 --> 05:48.498
Walk right out.

05:48.532 --> 05:49.866
Don't even break stride.

05:49.899 --> 05:51.701
Ellenor, you and Jimmy
stay behind

05:51.735 --> 05:52.736
till they kick you out.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.837
We need some ears in the room

05:53.870 --> 05:55.305
to get a sense
of what they're thinking.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.309
Let's go.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.581
Lindsay's in no shape
to talk right now.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.615
She needs medical attention.

06:05.649 --> 06:06.650
We're gonna get her
to a doctor.

06:06.683 --> 06:07.451
Could we just ask--

06:07.484 --> 06:08.652
She's in some shock.

06:08.685 --> 06:10.254
We can try to set
something up for tomorrow.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.688
Come on.

06:11.721 --> 06:13.123
Were you here
when it happened, bobby?

06:13.157 --> 06:14.824
I need to be
with Lindsay.

06:22.766 --> 06:23.767
Manslaughter?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.034
WASHINGTON: We should
consider it.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.069
Consider it?

06:26.103 --> 06:27.271
Consider this!

06:27.304 --> 06:28.505
They got no body.

06:28.538 --> 06:31.074
You can't prove no slaughter
without the man.

06:31.108 --> 06:33.277
Rodney, they can prove murder
without a body.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.911
I don't want to have
to tell you that again.

06:34.944 --> 06:36.613
They found remnants
of her in your car.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.415
Well, pet the pud, then,
for luck.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.849
We need--
Nor do I want

06:39.883 --> 06:41.251
to tell you again
to stop asking me

06:41.285 --> 06:42.619
to pet the pud.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.388
Sucky sucky, gimme gimme?

06:44.421 --> 06:47.124
Rodney, I will get off
this case right now.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.392
I swear.
I'm sick of it.

06:48.425 --> 06:49.326
No plea.

06:49.359 --> 06:50.660
We're gonna win this thing, Bec.

06:50.694 --> 06:52.629
You, me, and Pugsly,
we're a team!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.698
Now come on, let's go!

06:56.366 --> 06:58.001
You don't remember
shooting him at all?

06:58.368 --> 06:59.403
No.

07:01.805 --> 07:04.941
I remember he said the thing
about me going to heaven,

07:04.974 --> 07:08.545
and then I--

07:08.578 --> 07:10.480
I mean, then I was
in my room.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.016
And I went to the door
to look out.

07:13.717 --> 07:15.952
Bobby was calling
the police.

07:15.985 --> 07:17.787
O'Malley was on the floor.

07:24.461 --> 07:26.530
The press
is already calling.

07:26.563 --> 07:27.864
I assume
we have no comment.

07:27.897 --> 07:28.832
YOUNG: None for now.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.234
Public opinion could sway

07:30.267 --> 07:31.335
the decision to indict.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.969
We should probably
issue something.

07:33.002 --> 07:34.138
You learn anything
last night?

07:34.171 --> 07:35.805
Pretty tight-lipped.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.074
Helen said they'd probably
be open to self-defense,

07:38.108 --> 07:40.110
but Lindsay's got
to give them a statement.

07:44.748 --> 07:45.415
Where are we?

07:46.183 --> 07:47.484
No decisions
have been made yet.

07:48.017 --> 07:50.354
Let's get everybody
in the conference room.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.155
Where's Rebecca?

07:51.188 --> 07:53.323
She's in trial.

07:53.357 --> 07:54.924
After impounding the vehicle,

07:54.958 --> 07:56.393
we did an inventory search.

07:56.426 --> 07:58.362
We found some blood
in the trunk.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.830
Did you do any DNA testing?
DETECTIVE: We did.

08:00.864 --> 08:03.900
It was an exact genetic match
to the victim, Nancy Connell.

08:03.933 --> 08:06.035
GAMBLE:
What else did you find?

08:06.069 --> 08:06.836
DETECTIVE: Also in the trunk,

08:06.870 --> 08:08.071
a hammer

08:08.105 --> 08:10.674
with dried blood
and hair on the head.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.177
GAMBLE: And, sir,
were you able to determine

08:13.210 --> 08:14.511
who owned this vehicle?

08:14.544 --> 08:16.413
It was registered
to the defendant.

08:16.780 --> 08:18.748
GAMBLE: Thank you,
and at some point,

08:18.782 --> 08:20.484
you located the defendant.

08:20.517 --> 08:21.551
DETECTIVE: Yes,
he was arrested

08:21.585 --> 08:22.852
trying to purchase merchandise

08:22.886 --> 08:24.221
with a stolen credit card.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.822
Whose credit card?

08:25.855 --> 08:27.023
The victim's,

08:27.056 --> 08:28.125
Nancy Connell.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.894
WASHINGTON:
You say "the victim."

08:30.927 --> 08:32.596
was any victim ever found?

08:32.629 --> 08:34.164
No, we never found her,

08:34.198 --> 08:35.164
but the blood on
the hammer indicates--

08:35.198 --> 08:36.700
Thank you.

08:36.732 --> 08:39.135
Any witness
ever place Nancy Connell

08:39.169 --> 08:40.270
with my client?

08:40.304 --> 08:42.206
No.

08:43.873 --> 08:45.575
You really can't move
this idiot?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.010
He says he'll accept
trespassing.

08:47.577 --> 08:48.712
Don't look at me.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.447
I can't even get him
to take it seriously.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.482
He keeps demanding
I pet his pud.

08:53.817 --> 08:54.784
How's Lindsay?

08:56.086 --> 08:57.721
Not good.

08:57.754 --> 08:58.555
What's gonna happen?

08:58.588 --> 08:59.756
I'm not really in the loop.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.325
Walsh has it.

09:01.358 --> 09:02.559
That can't be
a good sign.

09:02.592 --> 09:04.228
It isn't.

09:04.528 --> 09:05.395
(knocks on door)

09:05.429 --> 09:06.730
MR. CONNELL: Ms. Gamble?

09:07.431 --> 09:08.232
WASHINGTON:
I'll see you back in there.

09:08.265 --> 09:09.266
Okay.

09:12.536 --> 09:13.837
You wanted to see us?

09:14.238 --> 09:15.239
Yes.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.275
The defendant may be
taking the stand.

09:18.308 --> 09:22.112
I'm not sure you're gonna want
to be there for that.

09:22.146 --> 09:24.047
I don't know what he might say
about your daughter.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.549
We've prepared ourselves.

09:25.582 --> 09:27.050
We choose to be there.

09:28.051 --> 09:29.052
Well, even so--

09:29.086 --> 09:30.887
MR. CONNELL:
We choose to be there.

09:35.292 --> 09:37.294
BERLUTI:
I still say don't talk.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.728
DOLE: In which case,
they'll arrest me.

09:38.762 --> 09:40.330
Lindsay, the likelihood

09:40.364 --> 09:42.766
is that there's going
to be an arrest here.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.068
Why? He was a serial killer

09:45.102 --> 09:46.670
violating his T. R. O.

09:46.703 --> 09:47.804
He had no gun.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.638
DONNELL:
She didn't know that.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.773
FRUTT: His pattern

09:49.806 --> 09:50.707
was to kill by knife, Bobby.

09:50.740 --> 09:51.908
She knew that.

09:51.941 --> 09:54.111
All I knew is that
he had come to my house

09:54.144 --> 09:54.878
and he wouldn't leave!

09:54.911 --> 09:56.446
Let's dial it back.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.083
If they don't have
enough to indict,

10:00.117 --> 10:01.918
rule of thumb,
we don't talk.

10:01.951 --> 10:03.153
But they do, Eugene,

10:03.187 --> 10:05.222
unless they exercise
discretion not to,

10:05.255 --> 10:06.390
and the only way

10:06.423 --> 10:08.158
they're ever going
to exercise that discretion

10:08.192 --> 10:10.427
is if bobby and I
give them a statement!

10:10.460 --> 10:11.561
YOUNG: I'd agree
if the goal here

10:11.595 --> 10:12.862
is to avoid arrest,

10:12.896 --> 10:14.864
but that may not be
a reasonable goal.

10:14.898 --> 10:15.665
FRUTT: Exactly.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.900
We should be thinking trial,

10:16.933 --> 10:18.535
how to win at trial,

10:18.568 --> 10:20.870
and in that case,
we give them nothing.

10:20.904 --> 10:22.406
DONNELL: Wait a second.

10:22.439 --> 10:24.174
You all just heard her story.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.576
What is she going to say
that could hurt us at trial?

10:31.448 --> 10:32.449
What?

10:32.482 --> 10:34.584
It's your version
that concerns me.

10:36.986 --> 10:38.088
My version?

10:38.122 --> 10:40.890
What you said she said
before she fired.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.059
He made the crack
about heaven.

10:43.093 --> 10:45.662
Lindsay said,
"You go on ahead without me."

10:45.695 --> 10:47.164
that sounds
a little too clever,

10:47.197 --> 10:48.632
reflective, even.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.300
We don't tell the police then.

10:54.838 --> 10:57.741
Look a cannibal

10:57.774 --> 10:59.143
showed up at my door,

10:59.176 --> 11:00.444
entered the premises,

11:00.477 --> 11:02.379
he had made threats
about killing me before.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.215
No jury is gonna convict me
for defending myself,

11:05.249 --> 11:07.984
and the prosecution
isn't gonna waste time

11:08.017 --> 11:09.986
trying a case they can't win!
Lindsay--

11:10.019 --> 11:12.456
DOLE: I am not standing trial
for murder!

11:15.592 --> 11:17.026
It'll destroy my career.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.262
I have a child.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.099
We need to squash
this thing now.

11:22.132 --> 11:23.600
And if I have to talk
to do that,

11:23.633 --> 11:25.068
then I'm going to talk!

11:25.102 --> 11:25.769
What if you say something--

11:25.802 --> 11:26.636
DOLE: I won't!

11:26.670 --> 11:28.238
I know the drill, Eugene!

11:28.272 --> 11:30.574
We might want to argue
diminished capacity,

11:30.607 --> 11:32.142
and we don't need
detectives testifying,

11:32.176 --> 11:34.711
"Gee, she seemed
to know the drill."

11:34.744 --> 11:36.045
My state of mind
today doesn't bear

11:36.079 --> 11:37.781
on what it was yesterday.
Even so--

11:37.814 --> 11:39.449
DOLE: If I don't talk,
they'll arrest me!

11:49.926 --> 11:52.996
It's my decision.

11:53.029 --> 11:54.964
I want to give them
a statement.

11:59.669 --> 12:02.139
Bobby, my office, please.

12:07.544 --> 12:09.446
She's in no place
to be making decisions

12:09.479 --> 12:11.348
if she's that emotional.
Eugene--

12:11.381 --> 12:12.849
YOUNG: And neither are you
if you can't see that.

12:14.851 --> 12:16.486
I have half a mind
to get her judged incompetent.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.723
DONNELL: What she's saying
isn't necessarily wrong, Eugene.

12:19.756 --> 12:20.824
If she's screaming it,

12:20.857 --> 12:22.426
I have to question
where it's coming from.

12:22.459 --> 12:23.227
DONNELL: I agree.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.329
It's a close call.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.331
But I think
we should cooperate.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.136
If we do this,

12:32.169 --> 12:33.603
it's under my control.

12:33.637 --> 12:34.771
If I don't like
what I'm hearing,

12:34.804 --> 12:36.072
I'm shutting it down.

12:37.274 --> 12:38.275
Okay.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.411
I just left Helen.

12:41.445 --> 12:42.446
Walsh has the case.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.448
She thinks
if there's any noise,

12:44.881 --> 12:46.683
he'll indict
to protect his ass.

12:46.716 --> 12:49.453
She also thinks you guys
have to say something.

12:49.486 --> 12:50.720
Otherwise,
you give them no choice.

12:51.455 --> 12:52.756
We've decided to talk.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.391
Okay.

12:54.424 --> 12:55.192
YOUNG: Bobby?

12:57.561 --> 12:58.995
Are you sure?

13:01.398 --> 13:02.466
Set it up.

13:14.511 --> 13:15.445
FRUTT: We all, of course,

13:15.479 --> 13:16.513
stand united

13:16.546 --> 13:18.782
in our support
of Lindsay Dole.

13:18.815 --> 13:21.218
It's always tragic when there's
a loss of human life,

13:21.251 --> 13:23.987
but in this situation,
Lindsay was defending

13:24.020 --> 13:24.754
her own life.

13:25.622 --> 13:26.490
As you know,

13:26.523 --> 13:27.491
this office tried to get

13:27.524 --> 13:28.958
Mr. O'Malley
civilly committed.

13:28.992 --> 13:32.296
We regarded him as a danger
to himself, to others,

13:32.329 --> 13:33.730
and especially to Lindsay

13:33.763 --> 13:35.965
since he had repeatedly
threatened her.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.801
(indistinct chatter)

13:37.834 --> 13:40.036
REPORTER: Is there a reason
she won't speak to police

13:40.069 --> 13:40.837
about what happened?

13:40.870 --> 13:43.173
The only reason was medical.

13:43.207 --> 13:45.609
Lindsay was naturally
suffering from some shock

13:45.642 --> 13:47.010
and was taken to a hospital.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.546
She plans to fully cooperate

13:49.579 --> 13:50.880
with this investigation.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.517
In fact, members of this office
are arranging for her

13:53.550 --> 13:55.452
to meet with police as we speak.

13:55.485 --> 13:56.820
(indistinct chatter)

13:58.054 --> 14:00.590
WASHINGTON: If you tell me
to kiss Pugsly one more time,

14:00.624 --> 14:01.758
I'll file a motion
to withdraw.

14:01.791 --> 14:02.959
Rebecca...

14:02.992 --> 14:04.194
WASHINGTON:
Stop touching yourself!

14:04.228 --> 14:06.630
It's a problem, okay?

14:06.663 --> 14:08.598
One doctor told me
I could cut back

14:08.632 --> 14:10.200
if I got others to touch it--

14:10.234 --> 14:11.835
sucky sucky.
That's it!

14:11.868 --> 14:13.036
EDSEL: Come on,
come on, come on.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.405
No judge is gonna let you off
middle of trial.

14:16.306 --> 14:17.407
Like I'm the first client
ever ask you

14:17.441 --> 14:19.509
to lick his chopper.

14:19.543 --> 14:20.744
Hmm? Huh?

14:20.777 --> 14:22.979
(chuckles)

14:24.080 --> 14:25.682
Do I testify or not?

14:29.153 --> 14:31.088
If you don't testify,

14:31.121 --> 14:32.689
the victim's blood
in your car,

14:32.722 --> 14:33.923
your prints
on the hammer,

14:33.957 --> 14:35.759
her blood and hair
on the hammer--

14:35.792 --> 14:37.327
all that goes unanswered.

14:37.361 --> 14:40.330
You do testify,
your record can be introduced.

14:40.364 --> 14:42.399
There are risks
either way, Rodney.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.669
I think the jury
has to hear from me.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.872
They don't get to hear
about the other, right?

14:48.905 --> 14:49.839
The other murder/rape?

14:49.873 --> 14:50.940
No. Since
you were acquitted,

14:50.974 --> 14:51.808
that can't come in.

14:51.841 --> 14:54.211
Excellent.

14:54.244 --> 14:56.079
I'll testify.

14:57.847 --> 15:00.317
Anything she said
to her husband, out of bounds--

15:00.350 --> 15:01.251
marital communication.

15:01.285 --> 15:02.986
Anything she said to us,

15:03.019 --> 15:04.921
out of bounds--
lawyer/client.

15:04.954 --> 15:07.457
Anything she said
to her doctor, out of bounds--

15:07.491 --> 15:08.158
privileged.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.926
Can we ask her her name?

15:10.394 --> 15:12.662
Look, she doesn't have
to talk at all.

15:12.696 --> 15:14.398
We can arrest her right now

15:14.431 --> 15:15.732
whether she talks or not.

15:15.765 --> 15:16.600
Oh, why haven't you?

15:16.633 --> 15:17.834
Would you like us to?

15:17.867 --> 15:18.635
All right.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.104
We're here to cooperate.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.606
YOUNG: We're offering you more
than you're legally entitled to.

15:22.639 --> 15:23.773
We're just setting up
the ground rules.

15:23.807 --> 15:24.574
It's your choice.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.113
Bring her in.

15:29.146 --> 15:30.414
No.

15:30.447 --> 15:31.481
You talk to her
at our firm.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.382
Why?

15:32.416 --> 15:33.417
Because that's the way

15:33.450 --> 15:34.784
it has to be.

15:42.492 --> 15:44.928
Eugene and Jimmy just called.

15:44.961 --> 15:47.164
Walsh agreed to meet here
under our control.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.065
They'll no doubt want
separate statements from us

15:49.099 --> 15:50.434
sequestered from each other.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.271
Just tell them he was coming
toward me when I fired.

15:55.972 --> 15:57.274
He wasn't.

15:57.307 --> 16:00.110
Bobby, in my mind,
which is what's relevant--

16:00.144 --> 16:01.678
Lindsay,

16:01.711 --> 16:04.514
let's get something
very straight.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.684
If we lie and they catch us
in a lie,

16:07.717 --> 16:08.718
you're dead.

16:09.786 --> 16:11.388
The truth supports you here.

16:11.421 --> 16:13.690
You were in fear
for your life.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.726
You just say what you saw
and remember, nothing more.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.429
But if they think I executed
him, they'll arrest me.

16:22.632 --> 16:24.201
Did I execute him?

16:24.668 --> 16:26.170
I think you snapped.

16:29.139 --> 16:30.140
Are you gonna tell them
what I said

16:30.174 --> 16:30.874
right before I fired?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.041
No.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.278
I think we should say
that he was coming for me.

16:34.311 --> 16:35.745
Lindsay--
DOLE: I threatened him

16:35.779 --> 16:36.946
in the court room.
That doesn't mean--

16:36.980 --> 16:38.014
DOLE: People heard me say
that I'd kill him!

16:38.047 --> 16:39.082
Hold on!
DOLE: You hold on.

16:39.116 --> 16:40.184
You're not the one
they might arrest!

16:40.217 --> 16:41.718
You need to calm down!
DOLE: I won't calm down!

16:41.751 --> 16:42.452
DONNELL: Shut up!

16:42.486 --> 16:43.920
Just shut up.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.524
Now listen to me.

16:48.525 --> 16:51.128
Forensics will show
whether the guy was moving.

16:51.161 --> 16:54.298
They'll be able piece together
everything that happened.

16:54.331 --> 16:57.033
Don't even think about trying
to change the facts.

17:00.370 --> 17:03.373
And beyond this trial--

17:03.407 --> 17:07.111
if there is a trial...

17:07.144 --> 17:08.578
you're a wife
and a mother.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.079
You will never survive
this emotionally

17:11.115 --> 17:13.250
if you try to lie
or cover it up.

17:18.588 --> 17:20.924
Lindsay,

17:20.957 --> 17:23.560
you did nothing wrong here.

17:24.728 --> 17:25.929
I killed the man.

17:25.962 --> 17:26.730
DONNELL: No.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.865
You snapped.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.501
You were under
extreme stress,

17:32.636 --> 17:34.704
oppression.

17:34.738 --> 17:37.107
You snapped.

17:37.141 --> 17:40.277
That's what happened.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.979
That's what we say happened.

17:47.016 --> 17:49.086
Why can't I even
remember it?

17:55.659 --> 17:57.261
EDSEL: I don't deny
being with her.

17:57.294 --> 17:58.195
I met her, all right.

17:58.228 --> 18:00.397
She met me,
my family, Pugsly.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.065
She met your family?

18:02.099 --> 18:03.800
EDSEL: Well, she would
if I had one.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.701
Orphan at 9.

18:05.769 --> 18:07.971
WASHINGTON: How did you meet
Nancy Connell, Rodney?

18:08.572 --> 18:11.275
Well, I was driving home.

18:11.308 --> 18:12.309
It was late,

18:12.342 --> 18:14.244
and I saw this man
assaulting her.

18:14.811 --> 18:15.479
Where?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.314
Side of the road
in Newton.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.048
I get out to help her,
and this guy,

18:19.082 --> 18:20.417
he's swinging
this hammer at her.

18:20.450 --> 18:23.420
So I did this kind of body block
on him, knocked him over.

18:23.453 --> 18:24.154
He took off.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.290
I helped her, and her head
was bleeding a little,

18:26.323 --> 18:28.392
but other than that,
she was okay.

18:28.425 --> 18:29.659
We ended up going back
to my place.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.528
She spent the night.

18:31.561 --> 18:34.298
Next morning, I wake up,
she's gone.

18:34.331 --> 18:35.532
My car is gone.

18:35.565 --> 18:37.501
I figure she must have
stole it or something.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.602
Next thing I know,

18:38.635 --> 18:39.869
I'm being arrested
for killing her,

18:39.903 --> 18:41.238
which I never did.

18:44.941 --> 18:47.111
GAMBLE: You just came
across her one night

18:47.144 --> 18:48.945
while another man
was hitting her

18:48.978 --> 18:50.447
on the head with a hammer.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.248
Yes, ma'am.

18:51.281 --> 18:52.349
And you saved her.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.483
Yes, ma'am.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.352
You also saved
the hammer.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.020
I threw it
in the trunk, yeah.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.956
You didn't call the police
to report the assault.

18:59.989 --> 19:01.525
She didn't want that.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.160
GAMBLE: Why, did she know him?

19:04.228 --> 19:04.894
She didn't say.

19:05.995 --> 19:08.298
GAMBLE: Well, surely
you discussed this other man.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.967
I don't think we did.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.202
She's being attacked
with a hammer.

19:12.236 --> 19:13.303
You don't ask
what it's about

19:13.337 --> 19:14.338
or who this guy is.

19:14.371 --> 19:15.905
You just take her back
to your place.

19:15.939 --> 19:17.607
Well, to be honest,

19:17.641 --> 19:18.642
the only thing
I was interested in

19:18.675 --> 19:20.210
was introducing her
to Pugsly.

19:20.244 --> 19:21.678
Who's Pugsly?

19:22.112 --> 19:23.079
My penis.

19:23.113 --> 19:24.581
(spectators murmuring)

19:27.117 --> 19:29.486
GAMBLE: Did you have
sexual relations

19:29.519 --> 19:30.520
with Nancy Connell?

19:30.554 --> 19:31.855
Yes.

19:32.689 --> 19:34.524
GAMBLE: And the next morning,
when you woke up...

19:35.058 --> 19:36.426
Gone.

19:36.460 --> 19:37.294
You know, it's happened
to me before.

19:37.327 --> 19:38.228
GAMBLE: Really?

19:38.262 --> 19:40.397
Do they always
steal your car?

19:41.165 --> 19:41.865
No.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.469
GAMBLE: Why didn't you report
your car as stolen,

19:45.502 --> 19:46.603
Mr. Edsel?

19:46.636 --> 19:47.704
Had drugs in it.

19:47.737 --> 19:48.872
Didn't want
to get arrested.

19:49.206 --> 19:50.574
GAMBLE: Your car
had drugs in it.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.041
Yes, ma'am.

19:52.376 --> 19:53.977
GAMBLE: Well, the police
didn't find any drugs.

19:54.010 --> 19:55.779
They did find
the murder weapon,

19:55.812 --> 19:59.749
and they did find
Nancy Connell's blood and hair.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.319
Well, the police probably
stole the drugs.

20:02.352 --> 20:05.755
They do that, and her blood
must have come from the hammer.

20:11.228 --> 20:13.797
Several witnesses
heard Lindsay Dole

20:13.830 --> 20:16.733
threaten to kill Mr. O'Malley
in court yesterday.

20:16.766 --> 20:18.935
Thus far, no charges
have been filed,

20:18.968 --> 20:22.071
but police investigators
are in the building behind me

20:22.106 --> 20:25.475
listening to what Lindsay Dole
has to say.

20:25.509 --> 20:26.910
McGUIRE: Did you know it was him
when you opened the door?

20:29.813 --> 20:30.480
No.

20:30.514 --> 20:31.215
WALSH: I'm sorry.

20:32.048 --> 20:33.683
Do you plan to supply
the answers?

20:34.151 --> 20:36.153
I was reminding her
what her answer was.

20:36.186 --> 20:37.654
She's still in some shock,
Mr. Walsh.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.756
WALSH: Yes, well,
this meeting is worthless

20:39.789 --> 20:42.759
if you're to supply signal
or influence her responses

20:42.792 --> 20:44.861
in any way, Counsel.

20:44.894 --> 20:45.862
Are we clear?

20:47.764 --> 20:48.732
Ask your questions.

20:49.799 --> 20:50.900
DOLE: I didn't know
who it was.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.536
My door doesn't have
a peep hole.

20:52.569 --> 20:53.903
And you just opened it?

20:53.937 --> 20:56.906
Look, it ran through my mind

20:56.940 --> 20:57.974
it could be him.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.211
I thought
the likelihood is, it isn't,

21:01.245 --> 21:03.012
but I thought it could be.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.014
But I wasn't gonna spend
the rest of my life

21:05.048 --> 21:06.383
afraid to open
my front door,

21:06.416 --> 21:07.851
so I opened it,

21:07.884 --> 21:10.053
and when it was him,
I just backed up,

21:10.087 --> 21:12.422
and I called Bobby,
and I called the police.

21:12.456 --> 21:13.723
Right away.

21:13.757 --> 21:15.092
Yes.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.293
Where was Bobby?

21:16.326 --> 21:19.229
I was in the bedroom
checking on our son.

21:19.263 --> 21:21.865
When she screamed,
I ran out.

21:21.898 --> 21:22.999
O'Malley was there.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.268
In the house.

21:24.301 --> 21:26.636
Just inside
the front door, yes.

21:26.670 --> 21:27.937
What was Lindsay doing?

21:27.971 --> 21:29.406
She was calling
the police.

21:29.673 --> 21:32.109
DETECTIVE: And Mr. O'Malley,
he was just standing there?

21:32.142 --> 21:33.076
DOLE: He was saying,

21:33.110 --> 21:35.612
"Why did you betray me,
Clarice?"

21:35.645 --> 21:36.880
Bobby kept telling him
to get out,

21:36.913 --> 21:38.215
threatened to throw him out,

21:38.248 --> 21:39.483
and that's when
he threatened Bobby.

21:39.516 --> 21:40.984
What'd he say to Bobby?

21:41.017 --> 21:43.853
He just looked at me
and said,

21:43.887 --> 21:46.556
"You might get hurt."

21:46.990 --> 21:48.258
It was at this point

21:48.292 --> 21:49.793
his other persona

21:49.826 --> 21:51.161
seemed to come out.

21:51.195 --> 21:52.896
How could you tell?

21:52.929 --> 21:56.600
He just suddenly
looked mad, crazy.

21:56.633 --> 22:00.170
Bobby kept going
"Who are you? Who are you?"

22:00.204 --> 22:01.305
Then he looks at me.

22:01.338 --> 22:02.139
Bobby.

22:02.172 --> 22:02.906
DOLE: No, O'Malley,

22:03.773 --> 22:06.510
and he said,
"You're going to heaven.

22:06.543 --> 22:09.213
I'm taking you to heaven."

22:09.246 --> 22:11.014
It looked like he planned
to kill me right then.

22:11.815 --> 22:13.217
And what happened?

22:13.250 --> 22:14.851
That's the last thing
I really remember.

22:16.052 --> 22:17.954
I heard Bobby
calling the police

22:17.987 --> 22:20.690
saying a man had been shot,

22:20.724 --> 22:23.093
And I thought to myself,

22:23.127 --> 22:24.661
"Oh, my God.

22:24.694 --> 22:26.763
Maybe it was me
who shot him."

22:32.302 --> 22:34.003
Come on, I nailed it.

22:34.037 --> 22:35.071
Give it up.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.473
WASHINGTON:
You didn't nail it, Rodney.

22:36.506 --> 22:38.275
That testimony
was laughable.

22:38.308 --> 22:39.676
You think the jury's
gonna believe

22:39.709 --> 22:41.645
you just happened upon her
being hit with a hammer?

22:41.945 --> 22:42.946
Reasonable doubt.

22:42.979 --> 22:45.048
WASHINGTON: You need
to think seriously

22:45.081 --> 22:46.116
about taking manslaughter

22:46.150 --> 22:47.617
because that
little performance--

22:47.651 --> 22:48.752
They have no body.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.620
They got no witnesses
to contradict me.

22:50.654 --> 22:52.089
That is reasonable doubt,

22:52.122 --> 22:53.957
and you argue it,
you got that?

22:53.990 --> 22:56.093
I don't have to do anything.

23:00.330 --> 23:01.731
Look...

23:01.765 --> 23:04.634
you don't make
a good impression, Rodney.

23:04.668 --> 23:06.903
You just came off not only
as if you're lying

23:06.936 --> 23:08.905
but as if you don't care.

23:09.706 --> 23:11.975
Her parents are sitting
in that courtroom.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.943
I saw the jury
looking at them.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.045
I saw the jury
looking at you.

23:16.079 --> 23:18.215
They are looking at you
with contempt.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.351
Now, you need to get
your mind off your penis

23:21.385 --> 23:22.952
and start thinking
about your neck,

23:22.986 --> 23:24.588
because in my
professional opinion,

23:24.621 --> 23:27.124
you are looking
at murder one,

23:28.092 --> 23:30.527
life in prison.

23:32.462 --> 23:34.063
Try to get that.

23:46.310 --> 23:47.877
YOUNG: Preliminary
forensics puts you

23:47.911 --> 23:49.279
between Lindsay
and O'Malley.

23:49.313 --> 23:50.480
I didn't deny that.
Did you?

23:50.514 --> 23:52.015
I didn't even talk
about where you were.

23:52.048 --> 23:54.984
FRUTT: They also show
he wasn't moving forward.

23:56.586 --> 23:58.122
Are they going to file?

23:58.155 --> 23:59.089
They're giving us
no indication,

23:59.123 --> 24:01.425
but if it looks that way,

24:01.458 --> 24:02.826
I'd like to surrender you
down there.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.961
The press is all over
our building.

24:04.994 --> 24:06.096
How could they make a case?

24:06.130 --> 24:07.664
The guy was a cannibal.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.033
The sticking point is
he wasn't armed.

24:11.601 --> 24:13.203
HATCHER: Rebecca,
this tape came for you.

24:13.537 --> 24:14.704
What tape?

24:14.738 --> 24:15.572
(sighs) There was no note.

24:15.605 --> 24:17.241
It was just delivered.

24:17.274 --> 24:18.875
Should I pop it in?

24:32.656 --> 24:34.991
My name is Nancy Connell.

24:36.926 --> 24:38.528
I'm being held.

24:41.798 --> 24:45.602
The date is May 10th, 2002.

24:45.635 --> 24:47.804
Here's a copy
of today's paper.

24:49.539 --> 24:51.441
Please help me.

24:53.477 --> 24:54.644
Please.

24:55.112 --> 24:56.413
(sniffles)

24:56.446 --> 24:58.582
Please.

25:04.388 --> 25:06.055
Who was that?

25:06.723 --> 25:10.160
It's the victim
from my murder trial.

25:11.795 --> 25:13.730
Victim? She's alive.

25:15.965 --> 25:17.767
I see that, Lucy.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.012
Lindsay Dole?

25:29.045 --> 25:30.013
Let us surrender her.

25:30.046 --> 25:30.980
I wish I could.

25:31.014 --> 25:32.081
Walsh ordered me
to take her here.

25:32.116 --> 25:33.417
Oh, come on.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.751
Please place your hands
behind your back.

25:34.784 --> 25:35.752
Bobby...

25:35.785 --> 25:36.853
I'm coming with you.

25:36.886 --> 25:37.987
McGUIRE: Lindsay Dole,
you're under arrest

25:38.021 --> 25:39.089
for the murder
of Lawrence O'Malley.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.592
You have the right
to remain silent...

25:43.059 --> 25:44.728
You say absolutely nothing.

25:44.761 --> 25:45.762
All talking stops.

25:46.096 --> 25:47.364
I need to take care
of a few things here.

25:47.397 --> 25:48.598
Then I'll be down there.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.434
McGUIRE: Someone will be
appointed to you.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.368
Do you understand
these rights

25:51.401 --> 25:52.302
as I read them to you?

26:10.287 --> 26:13.790
NANCY (over TV):
The date is May 10th, 2002.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.993
Here's a copy of today's paper.

26:18.027 --> 26:19.529
Please help me.

26:20.897 --> 26:22.065
This came to you when?

26:22.099 --> 26:24.334
Either late last night
or early this morning,

26:24.368 --> 26:25.369
left at the door.

26:25.635 --> 26:26.970
And you don't know
who delivered it?

26:27.003 --> 26:28.004
WASHINGTON: No.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.675
Obviously,
you have to dismiss, Helen.

26:31.708 --> 26:32.576
There's been no murder.

26:34.811 --> 26:38.348
I'll show it to the parents
to confirm it's her.

26:38.382 --> 26:39.783
Have you talked
to your client yet?

26:39.816 --> 26:41.185
He hasn't arrived
from jail yet.

26:41.218 --> 26:43.553
The transport's due,
well, now.

26:43.587 --> 26:44.688
All right, when he gets here,

26:44.721 --> 26:47.056
tell him the murder charges
will be dropped.

26:47.091 --> 26:48.858
He'll be re-arrested
for kidnapping,

26:48.892 --> 26:50.694
and I'm adding
a torture charge.

26:50.727 --> 26:52.462
Looking at the same
life sentence.

26:53.097 --> 26:54.231
I'll drop the torture charge

26:54.264 --> 26:56.266
if he tells us where she is.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.540
Rebecca...

27:04.374 --> 27:05.475
how is she?

27:07.377 --> 27:08.645
How would you be?

27:31.901 --> 27:33.870
MAN: Commonwealth
versus Lindsay Dole,

27:33.903 --> 27:34.971
murder in the second degree.

27:35.004 --> 27:36.540
YOUNG: Eugene Young
for the defendant.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.875
We waive reading,
enter a plea of not guilty

27:39.243 --> 27:40.444
and ask that
the defendant be released

27:40.477 --> 27:41.811
on her own recognizance.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.813
WALSH: Kenneth Walsh
for the Commonwealth.

27:43.847 --> 27:45.315
We do not oppose bail,

27:45.349 --> 27:47.851
but we would seek to have
the firm of Donnell-Young

27:47.884 --> 27:49.219
disqualified from
representing the defendant.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.088
They are potential witnesses.

27:51.121 --> 27:53.290
YOUNG: The only potential
witness would be Robert Donnell,

27:53.590 --> 27:55.959
who cannot be forced to testify
against his wife.

27:55.992 --> 27:57.494
Is counsel representing
to the court

27:57.527 --> 27:59.329
that Mr. Donnell
will not testify?

27:59.363 --> 28:01.865
We are making
no representations to the court.

28:01.898 --> 28:03.500
In which case,
I renew my motion

28:03.533 --> 28:05.435
to have this firm
disqualified.

28:05.469 --> 28:06.770
YOUNG: Any such motion
would be premature

28:06.803 --> 28:07.837
at an arraignment.

28:07.871 --> 28:09.873
I'd ask the court
to give Ms. Dole time

28:09.906 --> 28:11.608
to weigh how she wants
to proceed.

28:11.641 --> 28:13.810
I won't rule for now,

28:13.843 --> 28:17.181
but, Mr. Young,
I highly recommend another firm.

28:17.214 --> 28:19.082
YOUNG: We'd also be seeking
an immediate trial date.

28:19.316 --> 28:21.518
Ms. Dole is a respected
lawyer in the community

28:21.551 --> 28:23.353
and we do not want
these baseless charges

28:23.387 --> 28:24.888
hanging over her in perpetuity.

28:24.921 --> 28:27.224
Commonwealth
can be ready in a month.

28:27.257 --> 28:30.994
WEST: Trial date
is set for June 23rd.

28:31.027 --> 28:31.761
Anything else?

28:33.563 --> 28:35.899
The defendant is released
on $200,000 bail.

28:35.932 --> 28:36.633
(gavel bangs)

28:36.666 --> 28:37.467
Adjourned.

28:37.501 --> 28:40.504
(overlapping chatter)

28:43.473 --> 28:45.975
YOUNG: Get her
out the back.

28:46.009 --> 28:48.145
(overlapping chatter)

28:52.516 --> 28:54.218
Don't they have to let me go?

28:54.251 --> 28:55.819
No, they're filing
kidnapping charges.

28:55.852 --> 28:58.054
EDSEL: Hold on. I maybe
never went to no law school--

28:58.088 --> 28:59.123
Funny, I thought you did.

29:00.957 --> 29:03.093
But my friends
say that kidnapping

29:03.127 --> 29:05.229
would be what they call
a lesser included offense,

29:05.262 --> 29:07.131
which double jeopardy
counts for that, too.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.833
The kidnapping
is ongoing, Rodney.

29:09.866 --> 29:11.401
They can file for
as long as you have her.

29:11.435 --> 29:12.336
EDSEL: Well,
I don't have her.

29:12.369 --> 29:13.036
WASHINGTON:
Then, who does?

29:13.069 --> 29:14.104
How do I know?

29:14.138 --> 29:15.939
Maybe the man
with the hammer came back.

29:15.972 --> 29:17.541
Well, it's unfortunate
you don't have her

29:17.574 --> 29:19.042
because she's
your only ticket out.

29:19.609 --> 29:21.645
You are facing
kidnapping and torture.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.947
You're looking at life,
and they will get you on it.

29:23.980 --> 29:25.149
Oh, really? Gee,

29:25.182 --> 29:27.184
and you've been
so encouraging up till now.

29:27.217 --> 29:29.419
You listen to me.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.190
It's time for you
to get on my side.

29:33.490 --> 29:35.058
Fire me any time.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.697
The deal is this...

29:40.730 --> 29:43.367
I walk free and clear,

29:43.400 --> 29:45.335
or I don't help
with that girl.

29:46.236 --> 29:48.905
They're not going
to let you out.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.579
Well, you know what?

29:55.612 --> 29:57.547
I can survive prison.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.985
I can live there just fine.

30:03.052 --> 30:05.189
Now, where Nancy Connell is,

30:07.091 --> 30:09.293
who knows whether
she can live fine...

30:09.326 --> 30:10.260
or not...

30:13.430 --> 30:15.199
or for how long.

30:25.175 --> 30:27.244
YOUNG: The hurdle we face
is whether the judge

30:27.277 --> 30:29.646
will even allow us
to argue self-defense.

30:29.679 --> 30:31.047
What?

30:31.080 --> 30:33.082
FRUTT: This is just like
the Pearson case, Lindsay.

30:33.117 --> 30:34.351
That was a wrong ruling.

30:34.384 --> 30:36.720
Even so, we need
to brief it and prepare,

30:36.753 --> 30:39.523
because if we can't argue
justifiable use of force,

30:39.556 --> 30:41.691
that leaves us
with diminished capacity.

30:41.725 --> 30:43.527
What about
mistaken self-defense?

30:43.560 --> 30:44.594
FRUTT: That helps
with the first gunshot,

30:44.628 --> 30:45.529
but the second two,

30:46.563 --> 30:49.299
I'm more comfortable
with diminished capacity.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.667
The fact that
you can't remember

30:50.700 --> 30:52.402
pulling the trigger--

30:52.436 --> 30:53.337
what did the doctor call it?

30:53.370 --> 30:55.105
Psychological Amnesia.

30:55.139 --> 30:56.340
That may be the way to go.

30:56.373 --> 30:57.841
YOUNG: We need
to start lining up

30:57.874 --> 30:59.476
and preparing
our medical testimony now.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.511
We should also hire
our own forensics team.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.280
If we could at least
make the argument

31:03.313 --> 31:06.015
that he was leaning
towards you, that'll help.

31:08.685 --> 31:10.254
Bobby, wait.

31:10.287 --> 31:11.255
Before you go,

31:11.755 --> 31:13.323
I don't see
how you don't testify.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.392
The jury will wonder
if you don't.

31:15.425 --> 31:17.427
Which means we might
get bounced off the case.

31:17.461 --> 31:19.696
YOUNG: We need to prepare
a list of lawyers

31:19.729 --> 31:21.165
who we think can handle this.

31:21.198 --> 31:22.366
I want us doing it.

31:22.399 --> 31:23.867
We may not be allowed to do it.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.034
Let's fight that one first.

31:25.068 --> 31:28.372
I want us doing this case.

31:49.226 --> 31:50.894
We'll get through this.

31:52.529 --> 31:53.830
We?

31:53.863 --> 31:55.365
I'm the one
they arrested, Bobby.

31:55.399 --> 31:57.101
I didn't see you
wearing handcuffs today.

31:58.202 --> 32:00.370
You don't think
this involves me, Lindsay?

32:00.404 --> 32:01.671
Not enough, it doesn't.

32:01.905 --> 32:02.939
What does that mean?

32:02.972 --> 32:04.474
It means I feel alone, Bobby,

32:04.508 --> 32:06.410
like I'm always--

32:06.443 --> 32:08.745
I was alone when I got stabbed,

32:08.778 --> 32:10.914
then Hinks, now here.

32:10.947 --> 32:12.982
I don't feel like
you're ever with me, Bobby,

32:13.016 --> 32:15.385
that you understand
what I am going through

32:15.419 --> 32:17.554
or that you care to, and I--

32:17.587 --> 32:19.889
this is too much for me
to take on alone.

32:19.923 --> 32:21.258
I'm sick of it.

32:21.291 --> 32:22.226
You know what I'm sick of?

32:22.259 --> 32:23.893
I'm sick of you
isolating yourself

32:23.927 --> 32:26.230
only to declare
you're alone.

32:26.263 --> 32:26.896
Let me tell you something,

32:26.930 --> 32:27.931
would you--
Get out.

32:27.964 --> 32:29.433
You acted alone here.

32:29.466 --> 32:31.835
You pulled
that trigger alone.

32:31.868 --> 32:34.971
And now my son is faced
with losing his mother.

32:35.004 --> 32:36.640
Get the hell out.

32:36.673 --> 32:37.907
You don't think I'm in this?

32:37.941 --> 32:39.243
Leave me alone.

32:39.276 --> 32:41.578
Fine. Be alone.

32:41.878 --> 32:45.282
(door opens and closes)

32:47.016 --> 32:50.019
(sobbing)

32:57.394 --> 33:00.197
He says if he's not
given his freedom,

33:00.230 --> 33:02.199
he won't reveal
where Nancy Connell is.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.535
Helen, I believe him.

33:06.736 --> 33:08.138
I can't let him walk.

33:09.406 --> 33:11.641
(sighs)

33:11.675 --> 33:14.344
Is it considered privileged
who his friends are?

33:16.580 --> 33:18.882
Look, somebody has her.

33:18.915 --> 33:21.518
Somebody made that tape.

33:21.551 --> 33:23.553
I've heard him speak
of this one friend he has,

33:23.587 --> 33:25.989
only friend I'm aware he has.

33:26.556 --> 33:28.125
If it's an ongoing case,

33:28.158 --> 33:30.994
you have discretion
to blow the privilege.

33:34.231 --> 33:35.432
What's his name?

33:38.168 --> 33:39.969
Rebecca...

33:40.003 --> 33:42.339
she could be dying.

33:48.178 --> 33:50.547
Walter Errol.

33:51.481 --> 33:52.616
This is his address.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.724
If that favor is to count
for anything, Helen.

34:03.193 --> 34:05.395
Please let it count
for Lindsay.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.574
GAMBLE: Personally,
I think it is a mistake

34:18.608 --> 34:20.110
for you to represent her.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.610
DONNELL: It wouldn't be me.

34:21.645 --> 34:22.978
GAMBLE: I mean
your firm, Bobby.

34:23.012 --> 34:26.216
You're too close,
let alone all the conflicts.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.252
Name another lawyer
who would be better?

34:28.985 --> 34:30.286
Something tells me
that isn't

34:30.320 --> 34:32.589
what you came here
to discuss.

34:33.022 --> 34:34.824
(sighs)

34:36.092 --> 34:36.860
No.

34:40.264 --> 34:41.965
Remember when you came
to see Lindsay and me

34:41.998 --> 34:44.101
about possibly
entrapping O'Malley

34:44.134 --> 34:46.034
or getting him
committed civilly?

34:48.472 --> 34:50.806
Lindsay said something
at the end of the meeting.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.009
I'm not sure
you'd even remember.

34:54.478 --> 34:57.281
"If he resists, shoot him."

34:58.648 --> 35:00.250
You remember.

35:00.817 --> 35:03.120
Actually--

35:03.153 --> 35:05.122
(sighs)

35:05.155 --> 35:06.723
I forgot.

35:08.525 --> 35:11.995
Have you told anybody
what you forgot?

35:13.563 --> 35:14.664
No.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.266
(phone rings)

35:18.568 --> 35:21.271
GAMBLE: Helen Gamble.

35:21.771 --> 35:22.839
What?

35:25.575 --> 35:26.310
Dead?

35:26.343 --> 35:27.777
They showed up
at his apartment.

35:27.811 --> 35:30.614
Evidently,
he pulled a gun on them.

35:30.647 --> 35:31.981
The police opened fire.

35:32.015 --> 35:33.917
He was killed
almost instantly.

35:33.950 --> 35:35.852
You were only supposed
to question him.

35:35.885 --> 35:36.586
GAMBLE: Rebecca...

35:36.620 --> 35:37.821
You just shoot him?

35:37.854 --> 35:39.489
He pulled a gun on them.

35:39.523 --> 35:40.624
Oh, my God.

35:40.657 --> 35:42.492
GAMBLE: Look, the media...

35:42.526 --> 35:44.394
is onto the connection
with Nancy Connell.

35:44.428 --> 35:47.164
I will talk to the parents
about that, but...

35:47.197 --> 35:49.366
bottom line,
your client is back

35:49.399 --> 35:51.135
to being the only one
with information

35:51.168 --> 35:52.736
on where she might be.

35:52.769 --> 35:54.037
Like he's really
gonna help now.

35:54.070 --> 35:55.539
He had one friend in life.

35:55.572 --> 35:56.340
You shot him.

35:56.873 --> 35:57.941
I wanna meet with him.

35:58.342 --> 35:59.176
It won't do any good, Helen.

35:59.976 --> 36:01.878
I have nothing to lose.

36:02.846 --> 36:05.382
MAN: There they are.
MAN: Mr. Donnell, could you...

36:05.415 --> 36:07.884
WOMAN: Eugene. Eugene.
Can you give me a statement?

36:07.917 --> 36:09.886
(overlapping chatter)

36:09.919 --> 36:11.655
MAN: Bobby,
will you be testifying?

36:11.688 --> 36:13.157
The only reason Mr. Young

36:13.190 --> 36:15.259
wants his firm
to represent the defendant

36:15.292 --> 36:17.227
is because it curtails
our investigation.

36:17.261 --> 36:18.495
YOUNG: Not true.
There are people

36:18.528 --> 36:20.364
we'd like to interview
at Donnell-Young,

36:20.397 --> 36:21.931
and now we're cut off
because--

36:21.965 --> 36:23.667
You already
interviewed Bobby Donnell.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.068
There are others.
YOUNG: Look,

36:25.102 --> 36:27.070
we're not going
to impede the investigation,

36:27.104 --> 36:30.307
but Lindsay Dole should be able
to have the lawyer she wants.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.008
Her life is on the line.

36:32.041 --> 36:34.244
The benefit of the doubt
has to cut in favor

36:34.278 --> 36:35.112
of the defendant here.

36:35.479 --> 36:36.713
Who else do you wanna talk to?

36:36.746 --> 36:37.681
Everybody.

36:37.914 --> 36:40.684
They were with her all day long.

36:40.917 --> 36:43.553
They may be able to inform
on her state of mind.

36:44.053 --> 36:47.524
Mr. Young, if I'm to allow you
to represent her,

36:47.557 --> 36:49.493
you can't use that
as a shield.

36:49.526 --> 36:52.061
You're to make available
everybody in your firm.

36:52.496 --> 36:53.430
We will.

36:54.063 --> 36:54.831
WEST: Ms. Dole,

36:55.999 --> 36:58.435
you're sure you want your own
people defending you here?

36:58.735 --> 37:00.104
Yes, Your Honor.

37:01.238 --> 37:02.739
Very well.

37:02.772 --> 37:03.807
Do we have anything else?

37:03.840 --> 37:05.942
We do. We'd like
to enter our defense.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.744
I would ask the court
to deny self-defense

37:07.777 --> 37:08.978
since there's no basis.

37:09.012 --> 37:10.013
YOUNG:
Why don't you calm down

37:10.046 --> 37:12.382
and hear what we have
to say first?

37:13.950 --> 37:16.052
We're not going
self-defense, Your Honor.

37:16.085 --> 37:17.354
We're pleading not guilty

37:17.387 --> 37:19.389
relying on
Battered-woman Syndrome.

37:20.357 --> 37:21.158
What?

37:24.261 --> 37:26.096
We so enter it for the record.

37:26.130 --> 37:29.133
(indistinct chatter)

37:33.970 --> 37:35.205
MAN: Why Battered-woman
Syndrome?

37:35.239 --> 37:36.306
MAN: Why not self-defense?

37:36.340 --> 37:39.343
(overlapping chatter)

37:42.479 --> 37:44.714
MAN: That's enough
right there, hold it.

37:44.748 --> 37:46.383
Get out of my face.

37:46.416 --> 37:47.551
I'm in your face, Rodney,

37:47.584 --> 37:49.052
and I'm gonna stay
in your face

37:49.085 --> 37:51.888
until you tell us
where Nancy Connell is.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.757
Hey, you're the murderer.
I haven't--

37:53.790 --> 37:55.225
You tell us where she is,

37:55.259 --> 37:57.561
you eventually get released.

37:57.594 --> 37:58.962
Get this bitch
out of here.

38:02.899 --> 38:05.669
GAMBLE: I just issued
this little press release,

38:05.702 --> 38:08.071
and I let it slip...

38:08.105 --> 38:10.174
that you're
a suspected pedophile.

38:13.777 --> 38:16.213
That'll crimp the quality
of life, won't it, Rodney?

38:16.246 --> 38:18.548
How long you think
you'll live in prison now?

38:19.483 --> 38:20.584
You can't do this.

38:20.617 --> 38:22.952
You can't hang
no molester jacket on me.

38:22.986 --> 38:25.089
I already did.

38:25.122 --> 38:26.956
I put a clock on you.

38:29.393 --> 38:31.128
You're a dead man, Rodney.

38:39.269 --> 38:40.637
EDSEL: She can't do that,
can she?

38:41.238 --> 38:42.739
Just say I'm a pedophile?

38:42.772 --> 38:43.673
Well, what are you gonna do,

38:43.707 --> 38:45.209
sue her for defamation
of character?

38:45.842 --> 38:47.377
Tell her where
the girl is, Rodney.

38:47.411 --> 38:49.012
I'll make the best deal I can.

38:50.180 --> 38:51.715
How'd they know about Walter?

38:54.784 --> 38:56.052
You told 'em, didn't you?

38:56.085 --> 38:57.187
No, I didn't.

38:57.221 --> 39:00.157
Well, let me tell you, Rebecca,

39:00.190 --> 39:02.192
you just made me more valuable.

39:03.293 --> 39:04.928
Besides me,
Walter was the only person

39:04.961 --> 39:06.130
who knew her whereabouts.

39:06.163 --> 39:08.865
They need me now
or that girl dies.

39:08.898 --> 39:09.733
Rodney--

39:09.766 --> 39:12.001
You get me out of here,
Rebecca.

39:12.035 --> 39:13.069
WASHINGTON: Guards.
You had him killed.

39:13.103 --> 39:13.803
WASHINGTON: Guards.

39:13.837 --> 39:15.372
EDSEL: You had him killed.

39:15.405 --> 39:16.473
You make that deal.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.642
I know you had him killed.

39:19.509 --> 39:21.245
I'm saying nothing, Rebecca.

39:21.278 --> 39:22.679
You make that deal.

39:22.712 --> 39:23.380
You hear me?

39:23.413 --> 39:25.115
You make that deal.

39:53.877 --> 39:55.112
(sighs) When I was up on murder,

39:55.145 --> 39:56.746
did I take it out on you?

40:03.787 --> 40:05.355
You got to know
I'm here for you.

40:07.424 --> 40:08.692
I'm right here.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.229
No matter what.

40:14.331 --> 40:15.899
You got to know that.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.169
I do.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.176
I'm scared.

40:28.445 --> 40:31.415
I've been in such disbelief,

40:31.448 --> 40:33.417
saying they've got no case,

40:35.552 --> 40:37.053
but what terrifies me,

40:39.423 --> 40:40.790
I think they do.

40:42.459 --> 40:44.128
We're not going to lose.

40:46.296 --> 40:48.498
The day you hired me,

40:48.532 --> 40:51.235
you said never promise
a result to a client.

40:55.505 --> 40:57.274
I'm promising this.

40:59.443 --> 41:01.345
We're not going to lose.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.098
Jimmy and Bec
are gonna interview

41:21.131 --> 41:22.399
and prepare the doctors.

41:22.432 --> 41:24.268
They'll handle
the expert testimony.

41:24.301 --> 41:27.371
I'll run sort of
a command center here.

41:27.404 --> 41:29.373
I'll probably put Bobby
on ballistics.

41:29.406 --> 41:30.507
I'll do forensics.

41:31.441 --> 41:32.642
Okay.

41:33.277 --> 41:35.479
I want you to try the case.

41:40.484 --> 41:41.551
Okay.

41:56.032 --> 41:57.801
(sighs) What's up?

42:02.206 --> 42:03.707
Helen, what's wrong?

42:05.175 --> 42:07.277
Rodney Edsel was stabbed...

42:07.311 --> 42:09.113
40 minutes ago.

42:11.014 --> 42:12.382
He's dead.

42:22.959 --> 42:24.228
Just like that?

42:25.362 --> 42:26.763
I'm sorry.

42:26.796 --> 42:28.198
I never...

42:32.502 --> 42:33.237
What happens now?

42:33.270 --> 42:35.172
GAMBLE: I don't know.

42:35.205 --> 42:36.673
I'm still getting
the details.

42:36.706 --> 42:39.576
When I learn more,
I'll let you know.

42:44.448 --> 42:46.015
Okay.

42:46.049 --> 42:48.852
(breathes heavily)

42:48.885 --> 42:49.953
Okay.

43:01.898 --> 43:04.401
NANCY (over TV):
Here's a copy of today's paper.

43:06.436 --> 43:07.704
Please help me.

43:11.007 --> 43:12.242
Please.

43:16.846 --> 43:18.982
Please.

43:25.054 --> 43:26.490
Please.

43:41.705 --> 43:44.708
(music playing)

44:08.165 --> 44:09.199
You stinker!
