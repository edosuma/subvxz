WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:06.160
Mind the gap.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.440
Mind the gap.

00:10.520 --> 00:15.560
[man] Hello, uh, Steven?
Uh, could you do a quicker one?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.040
Mind the gap.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.320
[man] Uh, hello again.
How about doing a funky one?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.720
[sighs] What does that even mean?

00:22.800 --> 00:24.920
Who the fuck are you, anyway?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.320
Sorry, Steven, let me introduce
Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.160
[Toast] Of course.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.760
[Danny] Right, Steven, um, may we try
a couple of the traditional readings again

00:34.840 --> 00:37.720
where you emphasize
the word "mind" and the word "gap?"

00:37.800 --> 00:39.440
Yeah, alright. Are we rolling?

00:39.520 --> 00:41.240
Hi, Steven. This is Clem Fandango.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.000
-Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.880
Like the traditional delivery, Steven.
Where you hit the word "mind'

00:46.960 --> 00:49.200
-and the word "gap."
-Thanks for clearing that up, Clem.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.440
-All part of the service, Steven.
-[sighs] God!

00:51.520 --> 00:53.320
[Boris] Hello.
Uh, I've just had a thought.

00:53.400 --> 00:58.960
Could you leave quite a long gap
between the words "the" and "gap?"

01:00.760 --> 01:03.960
Mind... the...

01:07.520 --> 01:08.520
...gap.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.480
[Boris laughs] Let's have some fun.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.520
Try an even longer gap
between those words.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.400
Mind... the...

01:37.840 --> 01:40.400
[door opens and shuts]

02:18.360 --> 02:21.680
-What's your porn name, Ed?
-Posh Dong Minge Muncher.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.880
-That's your porn name, is it?
-Yes.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.640
So, Posh Dong
was the name of your first pet

02:26.720 --> 02:29.160
and Minge Muncher
was your mother's maiden name?

02:29.880 --> 02:30.800
Sorry?

02:30.880 --> 02:32.600
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.960
You combine the name of your first pet
with your mother's maiden name.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.280
I haven't a clue
what you're talking about, Toast.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.520
[sighs]

02:42.600 --> 02:44.840
Football. What's this, Ed?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.400
Ah, that's the application form

02:46.480 --> 02:49.240
for the prostitutes and celebrities
blow-football tournament.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.640
Ah, blow-football?

02:50.720 --> 02:52.840
That's where people
blow those tiny footballs around

02:52.920 --> 02:54.120
with straws in their mouths?

02:54.200 --> 02:58.200
Yes. The tournament's organized by my
show business charity the River Rats.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.120
Raises money for good causes. And this
year, I think it's for homeless ponies.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.520
Ah, so who takes part?
Actors and prostitutes?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.960
Well, technically,
celebrities and prostitutes.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.640
We get the odd footballer, but ironically
they're not very good at blow-football.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.200
Do they team you up with a prostitute
or do you bring your own?

03:14.280 --> 03:17.040
I always bring my own.
Why don't you take part, Toast?

03:17.120 --> 03:19.920
It's tremendous fun.
You must know some prostitutes.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.960
How about that Purchase woman
you're having an affair with?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.720
-She's one, isn't she?
-Well, she is,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.160
but she's also a very strong feminist.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.680
I think she'd find the whole thing
quite unPC.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.520
[sighs] No one took a blind bit of notice

03:31.600 --> 03:34.520
when Arthur Askey and Tommy Cooper
started it back in the '60s,

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
but nowadays, it would get up the noses
of those women's libbers

03:37.280 --> 03:39.080
and killjoys at the BBC.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.680
Blow-football with prostitutes?
This sounds right up my  rue.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
Can I fill this in?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.720
Excellent.
Could be good publicity for you, too.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.760
Why don't you ask Mrs. P?
Is she still with her husband?

03:49.840 --> 03:51.680
What's his name? Um... Roy?

03:51.760 --> 03:54.560
Ray. Ray bloody Purchase.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.440
What's he doing these days?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.840
[man] The man's pee-nas

03:58.920 --> 04:01.520
is then inserted into

04:01.600 --> 04:03.240
the other man's ay-nas.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.920
This is most unnatural.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.560
A man's pee-nas
is meant to go into a lady's vag-eena,

04:10.640 --> 04:13.000
not another man's ay-nas.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.400
-Hear, hear!
-[man] Very good.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.240
That is the end of today's lecture.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.440
I have to say, Swivney,
that was a great talk.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.720
The gays have had it all their own way
for far too long in this country.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.000
It really is super
that you have the bottle

04:34.080 --> 04:35.880
to come here and tell it like it is.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.320
Yes. Thank you, Ray Purchase.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.080
I know we both abhor
this rampant bum banditry

04:43.160 --> 04:46.120
I see everywhere in your country.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.800
Now, I'm meeting some
anti-gay friends of mine in a local pub.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.360
-Would you like to come along?
-Oh, yes.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.600
That sounds exactly like
my idea of a great night out.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.960
Don't touch me!

05:03.640 --> 05:06.880
-[door opens]
-[Ray] I'm home, my darling!

05:08.640 --> 05:09.960
[Ray sighs]

05:10.040 --> 05:14.240
Had a few drinks with Swivney
and the anti-gays.

05:14.320 --> 05:19.080
They want me to help them inform people
of the dangers of homosex,

05:19.160 --> 05:21.160
but in an entertaining way.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.800
Really? Actually, I'd rather not know
about it. It reeks of homophobia.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.080
Nonsense.
Don't know what you're talking about.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.600
Oh, God, I've got a skinful.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.200
Then I look forward to you snoring
really loudly.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.200
Snoring? I've never snored in my entire...

05:36.280 --> 05:37.680
[snores]

05:41.840 --> 05:43.760
[snores]

05:44.960 --> 05:46.280
[snores]

05:51.360 --> 05:52.640
[snores]

06:01.160 --> 06:03.800
Toast!
Don't you even bother to knock anymore?

06:05.160 --> 06:10.120
-Where's your soppy husband?
-He's here, actually. In the bed.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.800
-He looks dead.
-He's probably just hungover.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.240
He went to an anti-gay lecture
given by Nick Swivney.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.520
Oh, that idiot.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.480
Everybody got pissed
in the pub afterwards.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.920
Let's not talk. Let's just do it.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.920
[splutters]

06:25.000 --> 06:26.120
[grunts]

06:26.200 --> 06:28.000
[splutters]

06:29.520 --> 06:31.080
[grunts]

06:31.160 --> 06:33.360
[gibbers]

06:35.000 --> 06:36.200
[groans]

06:36.280 --> 06:38.280
[groans]

06:38.360 --> 06:41.800
-[Toast] Oh, yes!
-[Ray snores]

06:41.880 --> 06:46.840
Ed was talking to me about some celebrity
and prostitute blow-football tournament.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.080
Yes. Ray's asked me
to partner him this year.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.520
It's happening soon, isn't it?

06:50.600 --> 06:52.000
-So you know about it?
-Hm.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.040
Well, I was hoping you'd partner me.

06:54.120 --> 06:59.120
Oh. Well, it's just, well, Ray and I,
our marriage hasn't been great recently.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.280
I think this could bring us together more.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.080
I know a celebrity and prostitutes
blow-football tournament

07:04.160 --> 07:08.200
is frightfully unPC, but I think
my marriage should come first.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.440
I can get you the names
of a few prostitutes if you like.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.960
OK. I have to say,
I would quite like to win this tournament.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.640
As you know, I'm fiercely competitive
in everything I do.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.720
[snores]

07:22.560 --> 07:24.680
[continues snoring]

07:24.760 --> 07:27.440
This is a bit weird, Mrs. P.
I'd like to go.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.960
Maybe we should get

07:38.040 --> 07:40.000
a more up-to-date photo of you, Toast.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.720
Now that you're playing more...

07:41.800 --> 07:43.680
mature roles.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.440
No, leave it, Jane. It's fine.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.360
I mean, it maybe 30 years old, but as you
can see I haven't changed one bit.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.720
Hmm. Um...

07:51.800 --> 07:53.200
You know, I'd really like to win

07:53.280 --> 07:56.000
this prostitute and celebrity
blow-football tournament.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.640
As you know, I'm fiercely competitive
in everything I do.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.040
I'm just worried
it might be a little unPC.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.560
Not like you to think like that, Toast.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.640
[laughs] It isn't, is it?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.240
It's almost like
I turned into your friend Ben Elton.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.280
[laughs] Or Gary Barlow.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.000
[laughs] Who?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.000
Do you like Charles Dickens?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.320
Dickens? Yes, of course.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
An offer's come in.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.080
-To play Dickens?
-Yes, would you like to play Dickens?

08:20.160 --> 08:23.400
-Does Frank Bough like to party?
-What?

08:23.480 --> 08:26.840
Yeah, I'd love to play Dickens.
No one's done him properly.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.840
Callow tried in his one-man show,
but he was too camp.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.360
Not like Dickens at all.
He was more like Larry Grayson or...

08:33.440 --> 08:35.919
-Russell Brand. [laughs]
-Hmm...

08:36.720 --> 08:38.919
I'll find out some more details.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.679
[phone rings]

08:42.600 --> 08:46.040
Toast! Ah, Mrs. Purchase.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.720
Where are you?
Alright, I'll be right there.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.920
That was Mrs. Purchase.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.320
She's got some suggestions for prostitutes
to partner me in the tournament.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.320
It's in a place called Springleys
on the Fulham Road.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.720
Springleys? I don't know it.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.360
Is it a gentleman's club?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.000
Ah!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.680
Ah! There you are.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.320
Sorry I'm late.
Took me ages to find this place.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.680
I thought it was a club or wine bar.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.320
Hop in.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.280
Now, I've been looking at these.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.640
Now, that's Lola.
She is a really nice prostitute.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.080
Paige. I mean, she's a great prostitute.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.840
-Ruby. One of the best prostitutes around.
-Yes.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.320
Are any of these prostitutes
good at blow-football?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.520
-You what?
-Well...

09:39.600 --> 09:42.200
Ed says you're not allowed
to have sex with the prostitutes

09:42.280 --> 09:45.880
during the tournament, so I may as well go
with the one that's best at blow-football.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.760
-Oh, you want Wendy Nook.
-Who?

09:47.840 --> 09:50.680
Wendy Nook.
Yeah, she's a great prostitute.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.400
Probably the best one at blow-football.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.240
-Fantastic.
-Shall I give her a call?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.800
I must say,
you're looking very nice today, Mrs. P.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.480
Yes. Very nice.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.320
[grunts]

10:09.400 --> 10:11.200
-[splutters]
-Ooh!

10:13.920 --> 10:15.200
[gasps]

10:16.440 --> 10:18.840
Hang on, my balls are about to fizz!

10:21.520 --> 10:26.920
-Are you sure, Jane?
-Yes, yes. You look exactly like Dickens.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.480
But are you sure
I have to dress like him for the audition.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.880
I think it shows great attention to detail
on their part.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.400
They're even sending a driver
to pick you up.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.320
-Hmm!
-Not from here unfortunately,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.440
-but it shows they're keen.
-[flatly] Hmm.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.720
You still want to play Dickens, don't you?

10:43.800 --> 10:46.680
-Of course.
-Well, good.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.280
[exhales]

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
[Toast] What the hell is this?

10:59.520 --> 11:02.200
Something's wrong here, Jane.
Something's very, very wrong.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.360
Yes, sorry, Toast.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.120
There possibly
has been a misunderstanding here.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.000
The finer details
may have been on the attachment and I...

11:10.080 --> 11:11.880
I rarely read attachments.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.640
They think I'm a tour guide.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.720
I presumed you were being picked up
and taken to the audition.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.040
No, no, they think I'm a tour guide.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.520
So, you don't want to be a tour guide?

11:23.600 --> 11:27.640
Course I don't want to be
a bloody tour guide, Jane. I'm an actor!

11:27.720 --> 11:30.320
Is there a pension scheme
with tour guides?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.440
Anyone there you could talk to about that?

11:32.520 --> 11:34.240
Is... Is there a what?

11:34.320 --> 11:35.720
Pension?

11:35.800 --> 11:39.840
Acting's a shaky profession, Toast,
and there'll come a time, fairly soon,

11:39.920 --> 11:44.720
when you won't be able to act anymore.
This could be an opportunity for you.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.240
I'm not a tour guide, Jane, I'm an actor.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.760
We all have to take our last bow
at some point, Toast.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.520
We've had our fun over the years,
but this could be a dignified way out.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.040
I'm just...
I'm looking at the long-term option.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.280
What? And end up as a tour guide?

12:00.360 --> 12:02.920
Um, yes.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.720
Jane, that's probably
the worst idea you've ever had

12:05.800 --> 12:09.200
and if I wasn't such a nice guy,
I'd tell you to stick it up your Khyber.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.640
How dare you talk to me like that?
And don't make that face.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.880
If I were you, sunshine,
I'd learn the tour guide ropes,

12:15.960 --> 12:18.680
because I have a feeling
you'll be back, cap in hand.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.360
You just drive around all day, do you?

12:25.440 --> 12:29.320
-Yeah.
-Your job satisfaction must be nil.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.920
I'd probably throw myself in the Thames.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.280
[loud footsteps]

12:33.360 --> 12:36.400
Whoa, you can't get on here,
it's a tourist bus.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.440
[foreign accent]
I want a tour of the London.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.720
Well, then you need to go
to Piccadilly Circus.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.280
No, I have a tourist ticket
which allows me on tour.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.960
Look, best let her on.
I can't be doing with the arse-ache.

12:47.040 --> 12:47.920
He says go up.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.200
-Better go up there, keep an eye on her.
-Why?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.960
-A lot of them piss on the bus.
-Really?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.760
Yeah. Unless you keep an eye on them,
they piss on the bus.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.120
You know what people are like.

12:59.200 --> 13:02.360
Leave your sight for one second,
they're gonna start acting up.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.800
Better go and keep an eye on her.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.600
Look, I'm not a tour guide.
I'm a bloody actor.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.400
Are you, now?
Look, do us a favor, mate.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.480
Anything happens,
it's me what's gonna wear it, innit?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.960
[sighs] Oh, God.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.960
-What's that?
-I don't know.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.840
I'm an actor. I'm not a tour guide.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.000
If you don't tell me about the sights,
I will tell your boss that you touched me.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.320
-You'll do what?
-Yes!

13:30.400 --> 13:33.600
I will scream, “Help! He's touched me,”
and then you go on sex offenders list.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.240
[scoffs]

13:35.320 --> 13:37.200
Help! He's touching me!

13:37.280 --> 13:40.440
Alright, alright! God!

13:41.680 --> 13:45.080
-There's a council house.
-Use megaphone please.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
[feedback whine]

13:46.240 --> 13:50.560
There's a council house.
There's a lamp post.

13:50.640 --> 13:54.600
-Uh, that looks like an abattoir.
-Tell me historic facts, please.

13:54.680 --> 14:00.640
God knows. Um...
London was built in the 13th century.

14:00.720 --> 14:06.160
Mostly made of straw. Then a great fire
came and knackered the lot.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.800
[Ray on megaphone] Dick Whittington
is considered to have been

14:08.880 --> 14:11.080
a very popular Lord Mayor.

14:11.160 --> 14:16.280
I dread to think what he'd make of modern
London, what with gay marriages and all.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.160
Ray bloody Purchase.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
Toast.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.880
What the hell are you doing on that bus?
Is that Nick Swivney?

14:24.960 --> 14:29.320
It's the Beefeater Anti-Gay
Tour of London. Can't you read?

14:29.400 --> 14:32.320
-How pathetic!
-Who are you meant to be?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.040
-Gandhi.
-What?

14:34.120 --> 14:37.560
-No, I'm Charles Dickens, you berk.
-Never mind that.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.360
What the hell were you doing
asking my wife to partner you

14:40.440 --> 14:43.400
in the celebrity and prostitutes
blow-football tournament?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.360
-[Toast] Well, your wife's a prostitute.
-You shut your mouth, Toast!

14:46.440 --> 14:49.800
My wife's not a prostitute.
Well, not in the conventional sense.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.360
Oh, come on, Purchase.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.160
Everyone in London knows
your wife's a prostitute.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.800
[Ray] You take that back, Toast.
That's a slur. A bloody slur!

14:56.880 --> 15:00.640
[Toast] No, it isn't. Only difference is,
she doesn't do it for money,

15:00.720 --> 15:01.840
unless it's with you.

15:01.920 --> 15:06.400
-[Ray] She's not a prostitute.
-Yeah? Well then, what the shit is that?

15:08.400 --> 15:11.640
[Toast laughs] Bye-bye, Purchase.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.880
-[car alarms wail]
-[dog barks]

15:20.960 --> 15:22.080
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.280
Are you Wendy Nook?

15:23.360 --> 15:25.480
It's 60 for a hand job, 80 for a blow job

15:25.560 --> 15:27.240
and 95 for the full kahuna.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.480
No, I understand you play blow-football.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.240
It's another tenner for blow-football.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.160
How did you get that?

15:34.240 --> 15:37.000
I fell out of a tree.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.680
I'm Steven Toast.
Mrs. Purchase gave me your name.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.400
Said you were the best in the business.
I mean, where blow-football's concerned.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.680
Do you wanna play
afterwards or before, boy?

15:45.760 --> 15:47.400
No, no. You misunderstand.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.960
I'm not interested in the other.
I wanna win

15:50.040 --> 15:53.240
the River Rats Celebrity and Prostitute
Blow-football Tournament,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.880
and I want you to be my partner.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.720
-What's in it for me?
-It's for a good cause.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.360
-Yeah? What?
-Homeless ponies.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.680
-Oh. Really?
-Yes.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.720
You're telling me
there are homeless ponies?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.840
-Yes.
-God almighty.

16:09.920 --> 16:15.440
That's dreadful.
A very touching plight and...

16:15.520 --> 16:17.600
It's really quite sad.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.960
-I'm in!
-[laughs] Yes!

16:21.040 --> 16:23.640
[winces]

16:31.920 --> 16:33.640
Ooh, yes.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.680
-Ah, Toast!
-Ed, this is--

16:35.760 --> 16:37.200
Posh Dong!

16:38.440 --> 16:40.920
-You two know each other?
-Uh, not that I recall.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
-[prostitute 1] Hi, Posh.
-[prostitute 2] Hi, Posh.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.240
-Yeah.
-Er, Toast, this is Fifi.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.680
Hi, there.
Who the hell are these celebrities?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.880
-I don't recognize anyone.
-No, me neither.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.800
I'm told they're mostly stand-up comedians
and  X-Factor  runners-up.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.400
Still, it's all for a good cause.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.560
[voice whispers] Ray.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.440
-Toast.
-Ray Purchase.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.640
Hi, everyone.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.640
We're gonna win.
You know that, don't you, Toast?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.280
I wouldn't be so certain, Purchase.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.200
Oh, I've never lost a game
of blow-football in my life

17:11.280 --> 17:13.720
and I'm certainly
not going to lose to you.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.960
In fact, you know what?

17:15.040 --> 17:18.920
I am so confident we're gonna win,
that if we don't, I'll--

17:19.000 --> 17:21.240
-Do whatever I ask you.
-What?

17:21.319 --> 17:25.119
If you lose,
you'll do whatever I ask of you.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.359
Well, come on!
If you're so bloody sure of yourself.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.960
I'm so bloody sure of myself, Toast.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.560
OK, so if you lose,
you'll do whatever I ask you to?

17:32.640 --> 17:37.120
However disgusting or degrading?
Whatever I ask you to?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.000
-Yes.
-Ha!

17:39.080 --> 17:40.760
You heard him, everyone.
-[all] Yes!

17:40.840 --> 17:43.800
We are definitely, definitely
not gonna lose.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.760
Ray, are you sure this is wise?

17:45.840 --> 17:49.160
It's alright, darling.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

17:49.240 --> 17:53.240
It's without any risk whatsoever,
because we will win this tournament.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.280
[laughs] So what happens next, Ed?

17:56.360 --> 17:59.400
Well Toast, you're team A
and you're drawn against team D,

17:59.480 --> 18:02.440
who are Ralph Fiennes
and his partner Thumper,

18:02.520 --> 18:04.400
-who are over there.
-[Toast] Ralph.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.600
Alright, the first team
to get to ten goals wins

18:06.680 --> 18:09.160
and qualifies for the next round
on a simple knockout basis.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.440
Excellent. Are you ready, Wendy?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.760
Brilliant.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.280
[cheering]

18:16.360 --> 18:17.440
[cheers]

18:20.920 --> 18:23.160
-[crowd] Yeah!
-[Ray] Boom!

18:25.040 --> 18:28.320

[both cheer]

18:33.800 --> 18:35.280

18:35.360 --> 18:38.640
And so, we have a very exciting final
in prospect between team A,

18:38.720 --> 18:41.960
-Toast and Wendy Nook.
-[cheering]

18:42.040 --> 18:46.080
-And team E, Mr. and Mrs. Ray Purchase.
-[cheering]

18:46.160 --> 18:50.000

19:39.680 --> 19:40.720

19:41.520 --> 19:42.840
-Yeah!
-[cheering]

19:46.520 --> 19:50.080
Yes! I told you, Toast.
We are the champions.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.400
Suck on that, Sydney!

19:53.480 --> 19:55.880
Ah, just a moment,
Ralph Fiennes wants a word.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.920
What's this about?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.360
-Um, Ralph Fiennes has told me something.
-What did he say, Ed?

20:05.440 --> 20:06.800
He tells me that

20:06.880 --> 20:10.200
-Mrs. Purchase isn't really a prostitute.
-Yes, she is!

20:10.280 --> 20:13.000
That's not what you said on that bus,
Purchase.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.520
My wife's not a prostitute!

20:14.600 --> 20:17.480
That's what you said!
The whole of London heard you.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.920
Oh, Ray. It's sweet.
I'm really touched.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.680
I... I said not in the conventional sense.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.680
She doesn't get paid for it
but she's eligible for this, surely?

20:24.760 --> 20:29.200
Let's not forget that we're all here
to raise money for homeless ponies.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.400
That's the main thing.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.760
No, I'm sorry, Purchase.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.560
She doesn't get paid for her services,
so she is not strictly a prostitute.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.000
Hang on, Ed.
How does Ralph Fiennes know that?

20:38.080 --> 20:42.080
[crowd gasps]

20:42.160 --> 20:46.920
OK, um... I paid her a few times.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.320
-What did you say?
-I said, I've paid her a few times.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.920
Ooh, how sordid.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.200
Paying your own wife
to have sex with you.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.960
Ray! That was our little secret.

20:59.040 --> 21:03.800
Paying your own wife to have sex with you
is not proper prostitution.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.240
Therefore, I'm afraid, Ray
and Mrs. Purchase are disqualified.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.160
-[crowd groans]
-[Toast laughs]

21:09.240 --> 21:12.440
Which means that Toast and Wendy Nook
are deemed to be this year's champions.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.120
[cheering]

21:19.480 --> 21:21.320
Well, well, well.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.720
You know what this means,
don't you, Purchase?

21:26.000 --> 21:30.240
That you now have to do
exactly what I want.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.360
Don't remember agreeing to that.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.640
I'm afraid you did, old chap.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.280
-No, I didn't.
-[all] Yeah, you did.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.680
[man] Damn right. Damn straight.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.760
Now, let's see what I can come up with.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.760
[laughs] Ooh.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.480
You really were a bit silly, Ray,
making that rash bet.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.200
You've got no one to blame
but yourself.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.080
[Toast] What's gonna happen now is
we're gonna get down to business.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.040
-Like this.
-[Ray screams]

21:59.120 --> 22:03.320
[Mrs. Purchase] Oh, grow up, Ray.
You're acting like a spoilt child. Ooh!

22:03.400 --> 22:06.760
[Toast] And I'm going to pleasure
your wife orally, much like this.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.240
-[Mrs. Purchase] Oh! God, that's good!
-[Ray screams]

22:10.320 --> 22:11.320
[Mrs. Purchase] Ooh!

22:11.400 --> 22:15.120
Now we proceed to conventional
doggie-style intercourse.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.720
Much like this!

22:16.800 --> 22:17.920
[Ray screams]

22:18.000 --> 22:21.800
I'm sure you've noticed, Ray Purchase,
that I'm not wearing a sheath.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.200
So there's a fair chance
she'll become pregnant

22:24.280 --> 22:26.600
-with my child. Ha!
-[Ray screams]

22:26.680 --> 22:29.080
[Mrs. Purchase] Oh, Ray,
stop being so childish.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.360
-[Ray screams]
-This is good, Ray Purchase.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.560
