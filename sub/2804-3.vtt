SO THAT'S WHEN NEAL CAFFREY
WAS BORN.

40:52.275 --> 40:56.584
AFTER SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING,
I RAN AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK.

40:56.671 --> 40:59.761
BUT NOW I WANT TO KNOW.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.460
I WANT TO KNOW...

41:02.547 --> 41:04.636
I WANT TO KNOW
IF HE DID IT.

41:04.723 --> 41:08.422
WELL, ELLEN'S HERE NOW.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.468
GO FIND OUT.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.470
[ SIGHS ]

41:19.999 --> 41:24.699
NEAL,
IF I TELL YOU THIS,

41:24.786 --> 41:26.832
IT MAY OPEN DOORS

41:26.919 --> 41:30.139
THAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE
ARE BEST KEPT CLOSED.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.446
YOU ARRESTED HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:34.883 --> 41:37.756
ONE NIGHT I GOT A CALL
FROM A FELLOW OFFICER.

41:37.843 --> 41:40.976
HE SAID JAMES HAD ASKED
FOR AN "OFF THE BOOKS" MEETING.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.718
HE WANTED BACKUP.
THEN WHAT?

41:43.805 --> 41:47.330
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
THE OFFICER WAS DEAD.

41:47.417 --> 41:51.726
WE FOUND A GUN
WITH HIS PRINTS ON IT.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.339
HE KILLED A COP?

41:56.426 --> 41:59.081
HE SAID HE WAS INNOCENT.DID YOU BELIEVE HIM?

41:59.168 --> 42:01.867
JAMES WAS MANY THINGS,

42:01.954 --> 42:05.044
BUT I THOUGHT THERE WERE LINES
HE WOULDN'T CROSS.

42:05.131 --> 42:06.524
I INVESTIGATED.

42:06.611 --> 42:09.178
I WAS ONTO SOMETHING BIG.

42:09.265 --> 42:11.311
BUT THEN HE CONFESSED.

42:13.052 --> 42:14.749
DID HE DO IT?

42:16.403 --> 42:18.100
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.494
ELLEN, I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHO HE WAS.

42:24.106 --> 42:26.805
YOU SAID THERE WERE LINES
MY FATHER WOULD NEVER CROSS,

42:26.892 --> 42:27.806
BUT HE DID.

42:30.286 --> 42:33.028
I NEED TO KNOW WHO I AM.
