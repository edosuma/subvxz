WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:07.590
- What do we know?

00:07.632 --> 00:08.675
- So far, that there is a bomb

00:08.717 --> 00:09.843
and that the FBI
are in charge.

00:09.884 --> 00:11.344
- Keep everybody calm
and moving.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.179
- The thing, it's not real.
- How do you know?

00:13.221 --> 00:14.347
- I shouldn't have run.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.182
Beyond that--
[groans]

00:16.224 --> 00:17.559
I don't know what to tell you.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.519
- Can you think of
any reason why this man

00:19.561 --> 00:21.354
would run from the scene?
- No.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.190
- Everyone seems to have
questions about Anna Harvey.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.984
- You need to stop this
right now.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.610
- She's not done with us,
is she?

00:27.652 --> 00:28.862
- You didn't have to come,
you know?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.363
Could've called
the next name on the list.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.490
- It's my turn to volunteer.
I show up, always.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.867
- It's nice,
the police let you do this.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.201
- My first dad told me.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.120
- He told you
who left the bomb.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.706
- But it's a secret.
He made me promise.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.542
- Not the first time.
She's left before.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.711
I don't think
she's coming back to us.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.380
- Has there been infidelity
in your marriage, Mr. Serra?

00:47.422 --> 00:48.965
- Not from my side, all right?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.967
- Why the hell are
you looking into a possible

00:51.009 --> 00:52.385
missing wife case
when we've got

00:52.427 --> 00:54.304
an ongoing bomb threat
here against kids?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.555
- 'Cause they're related.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.307
- You think I don't stand up
for this family?

00:57.349 --> 00:59.517
Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.228
- What have you done
to your wife?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.940
[intense music]

01:05.982 --> 01:07.192
[indistinct chatter]

01:07.233 --> 01:08.943
- Sir. Sir!

01:08.985 --> 01:12.030
* *

01:12.072 --> 01:13.198
- Sir!

01:13.239 --> 01:14.991
[machine beeping]

01:15.033 --> 01:17.243
- Right through here.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.371
[chatter, machines beeping]

01:19.412 --> 01:22.082
[baby crying]
- Yeah, we can't find our--

01:22.123 --> 01:27.754
* *

01:27.796 --> 01:29.589
- We'll find someplace
for you, okay, ma'am?

01:29.631 --> 01:32.175
Keep some pressure on it,
all right?

01:35.553 --> 01:39.140
- [speaking Hebrew]
Janine.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.393
- Hm?
- Where's Davies?

01:41.434 --> 01:44.437
Did Davies get out?

01:44.479 --> 01:47.982
- None of us got out.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.818
- S-seven--

01:49.859 --> 01:54.114
* *

01:54.155 --> 01:56.074
Seven.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.118
- [praying in Hebrew]

01:58.159 --> 01:59.786
- Hey.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.995
Hey.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.956
* *

02:02.997 --> 02:04.833
Hey!

02:04.874 --> 02:08.003
- [continues praying]

02:08.044 --> 02:12.132
* *

02:12.173 --> 02:15.677
- You shouldn't be in here.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.220
Danny?

02:17.262 --> 02:24.185
* *

02:24.227 --> 02:25.603
[gasps]

02:31.443 --> 02:35.280
- [praying in Hebrew]

02:38.867 --> 02:43.538
* *

02:54.174 --> 02:57.135
[dramatic music]

02:57.177 --> 03:04.267
* *

03:45.266 --> 03:47.644
[siren wailing in distance]

03:56.236 --> 03:58.905
- Please tell me
you got some sleep.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.449
- I think a parent
planted the bomb.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.826
- You do?
- I do,

04:02.867 --> 04:04.911
and I'm afraid next time
the bomb will be real.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.163
- Who's your suspect?
- Elisabeth Serra.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.415
Her husband Paul was the one

04:08.456 --> 04:10.041
who told Janine
the bomb was fake.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
- What do we know about her?

04:12.127 --> 04:14.587
- These are her threatening
posts on Nextdoor Brooklyn

04:14.629 --> 04:17.007
venting on Anna Harvey
over how she runs her day care.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.843
- "Shut her down
by any means necessary.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.428
"Her time is gonna come.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.973
Anyone who hurts children
deserves no mercy."

04:25.015 --> 04:26.391
- They go on like that.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.560
When I asked Paul about his
wife, I sensed tension.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.396
I think it's because he knew
what Elisabeth did.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.939
- Where is Elisabeth now?

04:32.981 --> 04:35.567
- She could be lying low,
waiting to do something worse.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.485
- What does Paul say?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.279
- They had a fight and
she needed some time away

04:39.320 --> 04:40.613
down with her parents
in Mexico,

04:40.655 --> 04:42.282
but I don't know
if he's telling the truth.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.617
- So she could
still be in the States

04:44.659 --> 04:46.327
hiding out because
she planted the bomb.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.913
- I hope I'm wrong and she
isn't planning another attack.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.751
- Ohh, God forbid.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.045
I didn't get much sleep,
either.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.589
- I didn't think you would.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.632
We both know
we'll never have peace

04:59.674 --> 05:02.469
if children are harmed
or killed on our watch.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.431
[clanging]

05:12.979 --> 05:16.149
- Okay, who wants to go first?
[laughs]

05:16.191 --> 05:17.734
[clanging]

05:17.776 --> 05:19.944
[gasps]
- [laughs]

05:19.986 --> 05:23.823
Sorry.
- It's okay, sweet boy.

05:23.865 --> 05:27.077
Oh, all right.
Can I have it, please?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.870
Thank you.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.374
It's gonna be so good.
Wanna put it in?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.002
Good job.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.173
Oh. Ohh.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.092
* *

05:42.133 --> 05:44.052
We were gonna serve you
breakfast in bed.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.721
Yeah, it was Danny's idea.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.390
- Oh.
[laughter]

05:48.431 --> 05:50.266
- It was your idea?
- Yeah.

05:50.308 --> 05:55.188
- Was it your idea?
[laughter]

05:55.230 --> 05:58.066
- Oh, how lucky are we?

06:04.155 --> 06:05.699
- Mom is coming home.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.327
My first dad is bringing her

06:09.369 --> 06:11.871
and you're gonna have to leave.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.582
[knock at door]

06:17.961 --> 06:20.588
- Try not to
make a big mess, okay?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.216
- This is a subpoena
for all electronic devices

06:23.258 --> 06:25.885
that your wife has access to.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.345
- What? Why?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.639
- Because she's written
a number of threatening posts

06:29.681 --> 06:32.392
online about Anna Harvey,
and now she's a suspect.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.894
- The bomb threat?
Are you serious?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.147
- Your wife's posts
clearly show a strong,

06:37.188 --> 06:41.526
potentially to violent animus
toward Anna Harvey.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.069
- Look, you guys
are out of your mind.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.529
Elisabeth would never
do anything like this.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.907
Plus, she wasn't
the only one who hated Anna.

06:47.949 --> 06:51.077
- Yes, but Elisabeth's posts
were incendiary,

06:51.119 --> 06:54.164
suggesting a willingness to act
to see her brought low.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.082
A line was crossed.
These were threats.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.667
- All right,
so how can you even be sure

06:57.709 --> 06:58.752
that she's the one
who posted those things?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.796
Maybe it was me.
- Was it you?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.923
I need to see
those electronic devices.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.468
- Yeah, well, she's got
her phone with her, so--

07:06.509 --> 07:10.263
* *

07:10.305 --> 07:11.890
- Hm.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
- Hi, Danny.
- How did you know?

07:17.812 --> 07:19.856
- What did we know?
- That she did it.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.442
- That who did it?
- My mom.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.527
- But it was
supposed to be a secret.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.738
- Hey. Hey, hey, enough.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.951
Not another word to him,
you understand me?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.079
Here.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.830
Please leave.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.457
- Are you gonna bring back
my first dad?

07:37.499 --> 07:39.668
- Danny!

07:41.378 --> 07:44.631
I'd like you to leave.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.675
Please go.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.553
Let's go.

07:50.595 --> 07:56.017
* *

07:56.059 --> 07:57.727
Come here, buddy.
You're okay.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.193
- I don't know if I'm okay
leaving him with the boys.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.237
- We don't have enough
to get children services

08:07.278 --> 08:10.699
involved yet, and I don't see
Paul as a threat.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.993
- Do you think that
Danny's telling the truth

08:14.035 --> 08:15.829
that his mom really did
leave that bomb?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.456
- I think he's telling
the truth.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.792
As to whether it is the truth,

08:20.834 --> 08:23.169
I don't know.
Let's go.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.049
[chatter on TV]

08:32.554 --> 08:35.890
- We should sue them
for false arrest.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.892
They violated your civil rights
and hurt you.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.021
- Baby, I just wanna
forget the whole thing, okay?

08:41.062 --> 08:44.024
- I mean, what about your
emotional distress and mine?

08:44.065 --> 08:46.359
- Well--
- I mean, a million bucks

08:46.401 --> 08:47.694
is the least they can do.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.237
- Really?
- Yeah, the city hands those

08:49.279 --> 08:54.159
checks out like Aaron Judge
bobbleheads at Yankee Stadium.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.703
What are you doing?

08:56.745 --> 08:59.205
- Making moves on my wife.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.623
If that's okay.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.336
- Yeah, that's okay.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.628
- Good.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.552
- Baby, why were you there?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.346
At the day care.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.682
- I told you.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.392
I was walking
down the sidewalk,

09:19.434 --> 09:20.810
minding my own business.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.147
Anything else or--

09:25.940 --> 09:29.611
Can we get back to it?

09:33.448 --> 09:35.325
- [giggles]

09:40.622 --> 09:43.583

[horn blares]

10:01.476 --> 10:08.400
* *

10:29.754 --> 10:32.132
- Oh, hell no.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.217
Don't even think
of taking that right.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.593
Don't do it.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.512
Oh, you mother--

10:37.554 --> 10:39.347
[chuckles]

10:40.515 --> 10:41.599
He did it.

10:41.641 --> 10:48.773
* *

11:09.502 --> 11:10.837
- I received a call
from my colleague

11:10.879 --> 11:12.255
who observed still more

11:12.297 --> 11:15.925
suspicious activity
around the day care.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.386
Why is someone
targeting you, Anna?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.764
- I don't--I don't know.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.099
[door opens]

11:23.141 --> 11:24.809
- It's frightening
for most people

11:24.851 --> 11:26.728
being in a police precinct.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.646
This is your first time?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.398
- Yes.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.485
I mean, not counting
spring break

11:33.526 --> 11:36.446
sophomore year
at Sarah Lawrence.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.947
- What was the charge?

11:37.989 --> 11:40.533
- Destruction
of police property.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.497
I swung a palm frond at a siren

11:45.538 --> 11:49.042
on a Daytona Beach
police cruiser.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.086
Shattered it.
[chuckles]

11:51.127 --> 11:55.090
- Anna, you're attracted
to mischief, aren't you?

11:55.131 --> 11:58.510
- No. No, just a little
walk on the wild side.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.303
Nothing more.

12:00.345 --> 12:04.391
But I take my work
very seriously.

12:04.432 --> 12:09.229
Those parents put their trust
in me every morning.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.444
- Hi, it's Elisabeth.
You know what to do.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.904
[beeps]

12:19.823 --> 12:23.201
Hi, it's Elisabeth.
You know what to do.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.744
[beeps]
- Do you recognize this voice

12:24.786 --> 12:26.955
as the one making threats?

12:30.625 --> 12:35.088
- I have a nonstop white noise
soundtrack in my head

12:35.130 --> 12:38.800
of needy, self-satisfied women
just barking at me

12:38.842 --> 12:41.052
a chorus of entitlement,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.471
so that could really
be any of them.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.183
- Anna, please.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.103
Listen again, okay?

12:51.896 --> 12:55.859
- Hi, it's Elisabeth.
You know what to do.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.152
[beeps]

12:57.193 --> 13:00.572
- I'm still not sure.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.116
- Sarah, this is a sick

13:03.158 --> 13:06.244
and dangerous person
who threatens children.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.539
We need to find and lock up
whoever did this

13:09.581 --> 13:12.792
and any sort of direction
would be of use to us.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.755
- Whatever you think,
I wanna do what is right.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.590
- Right for who?

13:18.631 --> 13:22.135
- For the children
and their families.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.512
- What about Anna?

13:24.554 --> 13:27.432
Do you want to
do what's right for Anna?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.934
- I try not to think about
Anna when I don't have to.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.436
- Why?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.065
- [sighs]

13:35.106 --> 13:37.442
- Hm?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.903
When you first came in here
to speak with us,

13:39.944 --> 13:42.614
I just listened.
I let you talk.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.158
Now, I wanna
tell you something.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.618
You've seen cop shows, right?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.287
So you know that
there's someone watching

13:49.329 --> 13:51.748
on the other side
of that glass.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.459
My boss.

13:54.501 --> 13:58.129
- If you say so.
- Yeah, well, most captains

13:58.171 --> 13:59.381
when they're watching
this sort of thing,

13:59.422 --> 14:02.175
would keep their eye on you,
the respondent,

14:02.217 --> 14:04.010
but not Davies.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.596
No, she watches me.

14:06.638 --> 14:10.558
Every move.
Every question.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.979
If I miss something,
if I hesitate--

14:15.021 --> 14:17.190
[sighs]
You know what that's like,

14:17.232 --> 14:20.568
don't you?
Having a boss like that?

14:20.610 --> 14:25.949
How frustrating it can be.
How infuriating it can be.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.867
- Yes.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.954
- So I appreciate your loyalty.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.081
I do, but do you really think

14:33.123 --> 14:36.126
that Anna would cover for you
if the roles were reversed?

14:41.131 --> 14:44.092
- Anna only cares about Anna.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.595
She's a natural with the kids,
but she's always distracted.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.515
The center's overenrolled,
tuition keeps on going up,

14:50.557 --> 14:54.102
but Anna still
misses payroll sometimes.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.439
Her life seems
like Whac-A-Mole,

14:57.480 --> 14:59.441
and she can't catch up.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.947
- All right, so you know that

15:05.989 --> 15:07.115
that was just a strategy,
right?

15:07.157 --> 15:08.700
- Mm.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.244
Something Avi might've tried,
and it worked.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.079
- I meant no disrespect.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.789
- I know exactly
what you meant.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.168
Also know that
there's some truth to it.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.341
You have aspirations, Janine.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.426
You know,
standing where I am now,

15:26.468 --> 15:30.847
the commissioner's office,
maybe the governor's.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.684
And you're right.
I do expect a lot from you,

15:34.726 --> 15:38.188
but only because I think
that you can deliver.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.529
- [sighs]

15:47.280 --> 15:51.159
So I got a definite maybe
from Sarah.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.827
- Same with Anna.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.039
The fact they're not sure
it's Elisabeth worries me.

15:56.081 --> 15:59.709
If she were guilty, they would
be more certain, right?

15:59.751 --> 16:02.754
- Yeah, and also, we got into
Elisabeth's computer

16:02.796 --> 16:05.590
and she did purchase an
airline ticket for Mexico City

16:05.632 --> 16:07.342
which backs up
Paul's story about

16:07.384 --> 16:08.885
her going to visit her family.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.221
But she also bought
two tickets for her boys,

16:11.262 --> 16:14.182
which Paul didn't mention, and
she didn't buy one for Paul.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.892
And then she cancelled
all of them

16:15.934 --> 16:17.477
or Paul did.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.687
- I'm still trying
to figure out

16:18.728 --> 16:20.855
if Elisabeth could be
our bomber.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.400
No evidence on her computer
about bomb-making?

16:23.441 --> 16:25.360
- Mm-mm, CCS did a deep dive,
and there's nothing.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.862
Nothing on weaponry,
DIY devices,

16:27.904 --> 16:29.364
bomb-making, nothing.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.366
I think we're jumping to
conclusions about Elisabeth

16:31.408 --> 16:33.159
and none of them
are proving to be true.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.577
- We're not jumping
to conclusions.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.413
We're trying to figure out
possibilities.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.497
That's what we do.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.916
- Elisabeth didn't do it.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.876
I'd still bet the farm it was
one of the other parents.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.545
My money is on the Holts.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.338
Brad took a drive this morning
and you're never gonna guess

16:45.380 --> 16:46.756
where he decided
to pull over and rest.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.133
- Hmm, where?

16:48.174 --> 16:49.467
- The day care.
- Ugh.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.635
- Yeah, window rolled down.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.179
Just staring for,
like, 15 minutes.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.806
- Hold on.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.392
If you two are right, it means
we have more than one case.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.893
We have two cases.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.646
The bombing and
Elisabeth's disappearance.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.275
Elisabeth may not have planted
the bomb, but she is missing

17:05.316 --> 17:07.569
and I fear,
the victim of a crime.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.487
- And do we think
that these two cases

17:09.529 --> 17:10.780
are somehow connected or--

17:10.822 --> 17:13.658
- It would be reasonable
to assume they are.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.994
This fancy stationary
you saw at their apartment--

17:16.036 --> 17:17.328
- Uh-huh.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.330
- She works at
the Valley Forge Club, right?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.708
- Yeah, as an events planner.
- We start there.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.377
This place is full of
important and powerful people.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.339
Two NYPD detectives showing up
could rattle some cages.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.549
Maybe shake something loose.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.676
- Mm, cool.
I'll stay with the Holts.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.720
Maybe one of us will get lucky
and figure out what's going on.

17:33.762 --> 17:38.892
* *

17:38.933 --> 17:44.564
- Ah, man. A fake bomb at a
day care center leads us here.

17:44.606 --> 17:48.777
It's crazy how many crimes
in Brooklyn start in Manhattan

17:48.818 --> 17:51.488
at places like this.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.365
- You know this place?

17:53.406 --> 17:56.326
- Yeah, I've been a few times
as a guest.

17:56.368 --> 18:00.330
Went to school with girls
whose families belonged.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.166
- Membership here
is very exclusive.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.418
Not just wealth,

18:05.460 --> 18:09.047
members must be of
a certain social standing,

18:09.089 --> 18:11.549
a certain cultural class.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.387
- Yeah, well, today we get
an all-access pass.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.058
Ha, ha.
- Madame.

18:36.116 --> 18:42.914
1935, the club visits the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.959
- Wow,
during the Great Depression.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.460
That must've been fun.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.838
- The Lighthouse of Alexandria.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.757
The largest structure
of the ancient world.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.260
Now, nothing.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.679
I wonder if
it made them consider

18:57.721 --> 19:01.391
the hubris of human ambitions.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.351
- Doubt it.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.646
- Welcome to our club.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.190
We're always happy
to help the police.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.234
How may I help you, detectives?

19:11.276 --> 19:12.902
- Elisabeth Serra.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.612
- Queen. I adored her.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.490
Elisabeth was special,
inside and out.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.951
- Why are you using past tense?

19:19.993 --> 19:21.703
- Didn't someone tell you
when you called?

19:21.745 --> 19:24.414
She gave notice.
- When?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.875
- About a month ago.
I'm gutted, still.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.586
- Why did she leave?
- Exhaustion.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.464
Working with the rich
is a blessing and a curse.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.299
This place can wear on you.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.051
- How about a tour?

19:36.092 --> 19:38.345
We're pretty good at getting
what we need from people

19:38.386 --> 19:39.637
and I guarantee your members

19:39.679 --> 19:41.639
have never met
anyone quite like him.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.433
- What are you implying,
Detective?

19:43.475 --> 19:45.352
- Just that Elisabeth
must've turned heads,

19:45.393 --> 19:49.064
shaken things up, and so maybe
she made some enemies, too.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.942
- Elisabeth was no saint,
but she had integrity.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.111
None of the rumors were true.
- Hmm.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.322
- The more persistent,
which somehow made its way

19:57.364 --> 20:00.784
to the "Post," was an
association with Peter Hanney.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.620
- The Peter Hanney
who owns half of New York.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.413
- There was nothing to it.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.749
- When did you
last speak to her?

20:07.791 --> 20:10.960
- About a month ago when
she picked up her last check.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.213
- I think we'd like
to talk to Mr. Hanney.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.715
- I'm afraid Mr. Hanney
is not on the premises.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.592
Nor would I be bound
to tell you if he was.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.844
This is a private club.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.471
Now, please.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.146
- This damn case
keeps expanding.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.981
I hate it when that happens.
- What did you find?

20:32.023 --> 20:34.567
- Well, I don't know how
it fits into our bomb case,

20:34.609 --> 20:37.904
but it seems that the Serras
had serious financial problems.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.907
Up until five months ago,
they had perfect credit

20:40.949 --> 20:43.034
and then all of a sudden,
they started maxing out

20:43.076 --> 20:45.286
their credit cards
and drawing cash advances.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.747
- Well, money seems like
a pretty good motive

20:47.789 --> 20:49.541
to commit a crime,
but I just don't see

20:49.582 --> 20:52.711
how you make any money leaving
a fake bomb at a day care.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.295
Unless it's blackmail.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.297
- Could be.
Where was the money going?

20:56.339 --> 20:58.174
- Some kind of crypto play.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.968
According to
their bank records,

21:00.010 --> 21:02.470
their balance shot through
the roof over the past year

21:02.512 --> 21:03.638
and then it cratered.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.557
Something bad
definitely happened.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.517
- Bad things,
they follow the good.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.478
- Yeah, well, that's putting it
mildly in this case.

21:10.520 --> 21:16.568
They had $716,743
five months ago

21:16.609 --> 21:19.487
and it's sitting at
just over 3,000 now.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.489
Nest egg wiped out.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.576
- Okay, well, maybe Elisabeth
cleared out the accounts

21:24.617 --> 21:26.786
to start a new life
somewhere else.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.580
- I don't see her leaving
without the kids.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.207
At least not without
a plan to reunite.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.043
We need to find
Danny's first dad.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.961
He'll tell us
where Elisabeth has gone.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.755
- But what about the bomb case?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.215
If Elisabeth didn't do it
then who did?

21:39.257 --> 21:41.217
- I have Earl
sitting on the Holts.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.428
See if he needs any help,
otherwise, you two, stay on

21:43.470 --> 21:45.972
the Serras because whether
she's out bomber or not,

21:46.014 --> 21:48.641
I want to know where the hell
Elisabeth Serra is.

21:48.683 --> 21:53.730

22:16.836 --> 22:18.755
[car alarm chirps]

22:20.965 --> 22:22.592
[engine turns over]

22:22.634 --> 22:28.431
* *

22:28.473 --> 22:31.893
- Can you tell us about
your relationship with Danny?

22:31.935 --> 22:35.480
- I'm limited in what I can say
without a subpoena

22:35.522 --> 22:37.816
by law and by inclination.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.779
- You treat her sons.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.240
Sometimes children
with stressful home lives

22:45.281 --> 22:48.660
create alternate realities
to protect themselves.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.161
Could you speak to that?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.916
- It's a mistake to assume
that a child's mind

22:54.958 --> 22:57.293
isn't as complicated
as an adult's.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.546
It is. Often more so.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.424
When an adult feels unloved,

23:02.465 --> 23:05.343
they create an illusion
that they feel valued

23:05.385 --> 23:07.929
and then they hold on
to that illusion.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.473
But for a child,
the fantasy becomes real.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.642
A split occurs.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.770
- First and second dad.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.981
- Has Elisabeth
ever spoken with you

23:18.023 --> 23:21.818
about her relationship
with her husband?

23:21.860 --> 23:24.487
- She mentioned
feeling boxed in.

23:24.529 --> 23:27.866
I gave her a referral
for a few marriage counselors.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.701
I don't know
if she ever reached out.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.494
- Do you think
she could leave Paul?

23:31.536 --> 23:32.954
- Now, that would be difficult.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.874
She is deeply committed
to keeping the family intact.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.918
Elisabeth loves those boys.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.255
She's the one that brings
Danny and Eric in each week.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.715
She would never
leave without them.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.759
Plus, she loves her work.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.930
- Actually, she quit her job
a few weeks ago.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.766
Did you know that?

23:52.807 --> 23:55.060
- No.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.437
Why? She always spoke
positively about the club.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.773
- It's a very good question.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.858
You've been very helpful.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.445
Thank you, Dr. Sands.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.864
- What can you tell me
about Peter Hanney?

24:07.906 --> 24:09.949
- Hanney's a scrapper.
- Mm-hmm.

24:09.991 --> 24:12.619
- Good nose for a deal,
likes a fight,

24:12.660 --> 24:15.038
doesn't mind a seven figure
fine for a nine figure payday.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.374
- Okay, so you know him.

24:17.415 --> 24:20.210
- We've gone up against him
a couple of times.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.878
Came away bloody.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.464
- Not the kind of guy
who accepts defeat, huh?

24:24.506 --> 24:26.716
- Oh, he'd sooner pull the pin
and take everyone out

24:26.758 --> 24:28.343
then take a loss.

24:28.385 --> 24:32.263
There's this whole myth
he's built up for himself.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.392
Mean streets of Canarsie,
Marines, tour in Iraq,

24:35.433 --> 24:36.601
Rutgers night school,

24:36.643 --> 24:39.229
outhouse to the penthouse
in one generation.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.189
I mean, he starts
every negotiation

24:41.231 --> 24:43.650
by letting the other side know
where he grew up

24:43.692 --> 24:45.443
and he has nothing to lose.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.863
- Okay, well, thanks so much
for stepping out

24:48.905 --> 24:50.240
and meeting me, Darren.

24:50.281 --> 24:53.451
I know the markets
don't close for another hour.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.912
- Hour and two minutes.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.372
But who's counting?

24:59.416 --> 25:03.086
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

25:03.128 --> 25:05.213
Thought we had
a really good time.

25:05.255 --> 25:08.341
- I--I did have a really good
time with you.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.513
- You're a cop. I get it.
- Yeah.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.349
- Well, I'd love to
take you out again, anytime.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.770
- Hm.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.940
Um, one last thing.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.275
What would it mean that

25:25.316 --> 25:27.986
Hanney doesn't have
a permanent address?

25:29.654 --> 25:31.072
- Probably on the water.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.034
Moveable feast on a yacht.

25:34.075 --> 25:38.204
Easier to duck and weave
jurisdictions, taxes.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.291
You're not gonna find him
unless he wants to be found.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.090
- Did anyone else show up?

25:49.132 --> 25:50.842
- The minyan guys,

25:50.884 --> 25:53.136
some of my yeshiva boys,

25:53.178 --> 25:54.971
and the Jamaican caregiver
and her family.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.514
It was very nice.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.894
- I have a question.
- Hm?

26:03.772 --> 26:06.941
- How do you deal with
the fear?

26:06.983 --> 26:09.027
- My fears are legion.
Which one?

26:10.528 --> 26:13.114
- That something bad could
happen to your children.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.741
- Oh, that one.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.451
That one's a killer.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.579
I pray,

26:21.206 --> 26:24.834
I try to be grateful for
every day that they're healthy,

26:24.876 --> 26:26.628
and of course, I drink.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.004
Heavily when necessary.

26:35.136 --> 26:38.014
- What do you remember
about my father?

26:38.056 --> 26:39.391
- About your father?

26:42.060 --> 26:45.146
I remember a...

26:45.188 --> 26:47.524
darkness followed him.

26:51.820 --> 26:56.282
- In my mind, he was always
making people laugh.

26:56.324 --> 26:59.119
- Both these things
can be true.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.246
Why the sudden interest?

27:02.205 --> 27:04.040
- I don't know.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.210
Unfinished business.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.799
- How's your new partner?

27:12.841 --> 27:16.052
- She thinks understanding
all this will her on the job.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.930
- Bring her for Shabbos.
I'll invite the old gang.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.017
You like this woman?

27:25.228 --> 27:26.813
- Any requests?

27:26.855 --> 27:28.231
- You start. I'll follow you.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.692
You'll be Jerry, I'll be Bobby.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.570
- A Grateful Dead reference?

27:33.611 --> 27:35.238
- Zabarsky would approve.

27:38.158 --> 27:42.579
- [praying in Hebrew]

27:42.620 --> 27:49.586
* *

28:00.138 --> 28:01.264
- Here it is.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.308
6141 Canarsie Street.

28:03.350 --> 28:04.934
Hanney's childhood home.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.395
Seems to be a point of pride
that he came from nothing.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.318
- Behind every great fortune
is a great crime.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.112
I wonder what Mr. Hanney's was.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.198
- Oh, so just
because he's rich,

28:18.239 --> 28:19.783
you assume that
he's guilty of something.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.659
Hmm, doesn't seem fair.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.620
- I didn't say it.
Balzac did.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.622
- Oh, okay.
- Perhaps I should show

28:25.663 --> 28:27.332
more compassion
for those with wealth.

28:27.374 --> 28:30.001
I respect you and
you come from money.

28:30.043 --> 28:35.340
- Mm-mm, depends on
what you mean by money. And...

28:35.382 --> 28:37.550
if I did, so what?

28:40.512 --> 28:42.263
- The wealth itself
doesn't matter,

28:42.305 --> 28:44.099
but the getting of it does.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.351
In my experience,
the act of obtaining

28:46.393 --> 28:49.062
great wealth
reveals character.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.398
Once freed from the demands
of running one's living,

28:51.439 --> 28:53.817
reveals who and
what they really are.

28:55.694 --> 28:59.322
- Oh, so you took a little
look around my file, huh?

28:59.364 --> 29:00.949
You saw my parents' address,

29:00.990 --> 29:04.035
you saw the private school,
all of that.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.287
I'm not rich, Avi.

29:06.329 --> 29:11.001
Far from it, and I also don't
stereotype based on anything.

29:11.042 --> 29:14.212
Okay? Including money.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.757
[slams door]

29:17.799 --> 29:19.342
[knock at door]

29:20.885 --> 29:22.345
Mrs. Hanney?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.140
- What do you want?

29:25.181 --> 29:27.017
- We're detectives
with the NYPD

29:27.058 --> 29:29.227
and we're looking for your son.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.520
- [chuckles]
I don't--

29:30.562 --> 29:33.690
- Good for you.
You found him.

29:33.732 --> 29:35.942
- You knew we were
looking for you.

29:35.984 --> 29:39.112
- Mr. Rasgon, at the club,
might've said something.

29:39.154 --> 29:41.156
- So you were ducking us.

29:41.197 --> 29:44.909
- No, I've been exercising
my right to be left alone.

29:46.786 --> 29:50.415
- What exactly are
you hiding from, Mr. Hanney?

29:50.457 --> 29:52.584
- I'm not hiding.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.836
Staying with my mother
in my childhood home

29:54.878 --> 29:56.629
is hardly hiding.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.799
- So what's the deal
with you and Elisabeth?

30:01.926 --> 30:03.762
- The deal?

30:05.263 --> 30:08.558
We didn't have a deal.
We had chemistry.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.227
We could've been
great together.

30:11.269 --> 30:13.646
I invited her
to go away with me.

30:13.688 --> 30:17.650
In fact, I begged her to,
and I'm not a man who begs.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.361
Unless, of course, I have to.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.071
- So what happened?

30:21.112 --> 30:22.989
- I'm a persistent man.

30:23.031 --> 30:26.117
She said no
until she finally said yes.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.869
- She said yes?

30:28.953 --> 30:30.997
- And then what?

30:31.039 --> 30:32.665
[tense music]

30:32.707 --> 30:36.753
- We were set to sail away
on my yacht last week.

30:36.795 --> 30:39.297
She didn't show.

30:39.339 --> 30:42.926
I haven't heard from her since.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.888
Money can't buy everything.
Close to everything,

30:46.930 --> 30:48.598
but not everything.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.933
- That must've hurt

30:49.974 --> 30:52.394
getting ghosted
by Elisabeth like that.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.396
- She didn't ghost him.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.606
- What makes you say that?

30:56.648 --> 30:58.441
- The Serra apartment
is filled with evidence

30:58.483 --> 31:01.277
of the kind of
person Elisabeth is.

31:01.319 --> 31:04.072
The color she chose
for the rooms,

31:04.114 --> 31:05.949
the clothes for the boys,

31:05.990 --> 31:09.369
the order she sought to create,
a sense of safety.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.372
This was a woman with values.

31:12.414 --> 31:17.252
* *

31:17.293 --> 31:19.504
- Thanks.

31:23.383 --> 31:26.344
- This was a caring mother.

31:26.386 --> 31:28.304
She would never
have abandoned her sons

31:28.346 --> 31:30.140
and she didn't.

31:30.181 --> 31:33.143
She was taken from them.

31:33.184 --> 31:35.812
Elisabeth Serra isn't missing.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.355
She's dead.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.282
[dramatic music]

31:47.323 --> 31:54.289
* *

31:54.330 --> 31:57.334
[machine whirring]

31:57.375 --> 32:04.507
* *

32:15.185 --> 32:18.271
[sawing continues]

32:25.362 --> 32:27.739
- Hey.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.990
So what was so important

32:29.032 --> 32:31.076
that you couldn't say it
over the phone?

32:31.117 --> 32:33.912
Did you find Elisabeth?
- Find her?

32:33.953 --> 32:36.623
Oh, well, now, we can agree
that she's missing.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.124
- You mind if
we make this quick?

32:38.166 --> 32:41.002
There's a 5K bonus
if I get done by Friday.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.755
- By all means,
$5,000 is a lot of money.

32:43.797 --> 32:45.674
- Yeah, and Danny needs braces.

32:45.715 --> 32:48.301
Hey, maybe his first dad
could spring.

32:48.343 --> 32:50.512
- How did you get into
this line of work?

32:50.553 --> 32:52.722
Radiant heating, is it?

32:55.058 --> 32:57.936
- It was Elisabeth, actually.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.271
You know, she always
had cold feet.

33:00.313 --> 33:02.607
Summertime, it didn't matter,
always cold.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.318
So we took the boys sledding
this one time

33:05.360 --> 33:07.904
or maybe it was just Danny
at that point,

33:07.946 --> 33:09.155
but we got snowed in.

33:09.197 --> 33:10.490
We couldn't get
back in the city.

33:10.532 --> 33:12.158
Found this B&B.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.120
It had heated floors
in the bathroom.

33:15.161 --> 33:18.957
Elisabeth just couldn't
get over how every, little itch

33:18.998 --> 33:22.460
that some people have
just get scratched.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.295
Rich people can't have
cold feet.

33:27.924 --> 33:30.927
A lightbulb just
kinda went off.

33:32.387 --> 33:35.140
- You must work in
fractions of fractions

33:35.181 --> 33:37.517
the smallest spaces.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.811
- Precision is key.

33:39.853 --> 33:41.062
- What is that measurement?

33:41.104 --> 33:43.982
- We measure
to 3/16ths of an inch.

33:44.024 --> 33:46.526
- 3/16ths.
- Yeah.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.403
- If anything's off by a hair,

33:48.445 --> 33:51.740
the heat doesn't get
distributed evenly, so...

33:51.781 --> 33:53.241
- 3/16 of an inch.

33:53.283 --> 33:55.577
Spinoza believed numbers
were a way to describe

33:55.618 --> 33:57.454
God's activity in the world.

33:57.495 --> 34:00.623
When I was younger,
I needed proof of everything.

34:00.665 --> 34:04.210
God most of all
and numbers were proof.

34:04.252 --> 34:05.670
Take the number seven.

34:05.712 --> 34:08.423
God created the world
in seven days.

34:08.465 --> 34:11.760
The first verse in the Bible
is seven words.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.970
Shabbat is celebrated
on the seventh day.

34:14.012 --> 34:16.264
Some Jews believe in Gematria,

34:16.306 --> 34:20.226
giving each letter of the
Bible its own numeric value

34:20.268 --> 34:23.146
adding them to reveal
hidden truths.

34:24.481 --> 34:28.777
- 917-555-0179

34:28.818 --> 34:30.653
You know those numbers,
don't you, Paul?

34:31.780 --> 34:33.114
- Did you find her phone?

34:33.156 --> 34:36.117
- No. No need.
We just pulled her records.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.413
She has spent a lot of time
talking the past few months

34:40.455 --> 34:42.832
to a man named Peter Hanney.

34:42.874 --> 34:44.459
I mean, a lot.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.211
- Yeah.
I know.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.381
- What do you know
about the affair?

34:49.422 --> 34:52.425
- They flirted, okay?
Nothing happened.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.302
- Is that what she told you?

34:54.344 --> 34:56.805
'Cause Mr. Hanney tells us
a different story.

34:56.846 --> 35:00.183
[tense music]

35:07.399 --> 35:10.318
[tense music]

35:10.360 --> 35:15.448
* *

35:37.887 --> 35:38.972
- Okay.

35:39.014 --> 35:46.146
* *

35:48.857 --> 35:51.443
[engine stops]
[door shuts]

35:51.484 --> 35:53.278
[alarm chirps]

35:53.319 --> 36:00.243
* *

36:04.497 --> 36:06.499
- Hey, Cap, we might
have a problem.

36:06.541 --> 36:09.419
Holt just rolled up
to some warehouse.

36:09.461 --> 36:12.005
1983 St. John's Place.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.548
He may be gathering materials
for a bomb.

36:13.590 --> 36:15.425
Call in a 10-85 for me.
I'm gonna take a look.

36:15.467 --> 36:22.390
* *

36:56.132 --> 37:03.264
* *

37:33.003 --> 37:40.093
* *

37:50.562 --> 37:51.813
- [screams]

37:51.855 --> 37:53.314
- What the hell, man?

37:53.356 --> 37:55.650
- Anna, what the hell?
- Shit.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.986
- You okay?
- Oh!

37:58.028 --> 38:00.113
What's in these boxes, Holt?
Another bomb?

38:00.155 --> 38:01.698
What do you got in here, huh?

38:01.740 --> 38:03.908
- Those are vape pens, bro.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.243
What are you doing?

38:06.286 --> 38:08.455
- How long has
this been going on?

38:08.913 --> 38:11.458
- Shit.
- Put your clothes on.

38:11.499 --> 38:13.543
- Holt and Anna having sex?

38:13.585 --> 38:14.711
- Mm-hmm.
[laughs]

38:14.753 --> 38:16.129
- You're kidding.
- Mm-mm.

38:16.171 --> 38:17.756
- At least they didn't do it
in the day care.

38:17.797 --> 38:21.092
There's some restraint in that.
- [laughs]

38:21.134 --> 38:23.428
- Was this a long-term affair?

38:23.470 --> 38:26.514
- It seemed to me like it is.

38:26.556 --> 38:27.932
I mean, neither one of them
would talk to me,

38:27.974 --> 38:28.933
and it's not like
I could arrest them

38:28.975 --> 38:30.435
even if I wanted to.
- [chuckles]

38:30.477 --> 38:31.978
What would you arrest them
for exactly?

38:32.020 --> 38:34.939
I mean, sex between consensual
adults isn't a crime, yet.

38:34.981 --> 38:36.066
- What about
withholding evidence?

38:36.107 --> 38:37.150
I mean, neither one said that

38:37.192 --> 38:38.151
they were sleeping
with one another.

38:38.193 --> 38:39.569
- Okay, wait. Hold on.
- What?

38:39.611 --> 38:42.447
- So does Earl walking in on
them make it more or less

38:42.489 --> 38:46.076
likely that Holt was the one
who left that bomb outside?

38:46.117 --> 38:47.452
- Marcie might
have something to say

38:47.494 --> 38:49.162
about her husband's infidelity.

38:49.204 --> 38:52.123
- Ooh, do we think she knows?

38:52.165 --> 38:53.875
- Question is not just
whether she knows

38:53.917 --> 38:55.335
he's having an affair,

38:55.377 --> 38:57.462
but who he's having it with.

38:57.504 --> 39:02.509
* *

39:08.682 --> 39:10.016
[alarm chirps]

39:18.274 --> 39:20.193
[blow lands]
- [grunts]

39:20.235 --> 39:27.367
* *

39:33.873 --> 39:40.755
