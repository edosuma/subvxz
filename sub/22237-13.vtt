WEBVTT

00:00.406 --> 00:01.904
Andy!

00:01.925 --> 00:04.848
- Did you do something to Andy Lau?
- They haven't done anything!

00:04.869 --> 00:08.703
I've been researching missing persons.
Whatever happened to them happened to Andy.

00:08.724 --> 00:10.997
We need to find another tear
to talk to my friends,

00:11.018 --> 00:12.774
so we can find a way to get me home.

00:13.935 --> 00:17.063
- What's happening?
- You did this. Run!

00:18.024 --> 00:20.080
Why did you say I did this?

00:21.000 --> 00:24.068
You go inside. I'll keep an eye out
for our favourite sisters.

00:26.232 --> 00:28.979
- This is what I saw.
- Do you know where I am?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.410
I think it's where Andy is.
You can't go in after him.

00:37.217 --> 00:39.944
- Alice sent me here!
- Not sent, swapped!

00:39.965 --> 00:42.744
So to get you out,
we have to send someone else in!

00:42.765 --> 00:44.553
Alice, we know you're here.

00:44.574 --> 00:47.007
Access my power, limits undone.

00:47.028 --> 00:48.734
Our powers...

00:53.313 --> 00:54.447
It's over.

00:54.468 --> 00:57.828
- She bound our powers to Phoebe.
- So we're all just... normal?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.805
And powerless. It's game over.

Season 2, Episode 13

01:46.317 --> 01:49.317
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:52.496 --> 01:53.708
What is it?

01:55.126 --> 01:59.930
- I just... had a vision.
- Oscar's power...

02:00.977 --> 02:04.535
I saw you -
you were afraid.

02:05.862 --> 02:09.035
We have to destroy this - now!

02:14.527 --> 02:17.372
BINDING SPELL

02:19.653 --> 02:24.648
- So we find a way to reverse the spell.
- How? Phoebe has all our powers.

02:25.221 --> 02:27.918
They've won. It's over.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.663
But what about Andy?

02:31.893 --> 02:34.890
A minute ago you were ready
to swap yourself for him.

02:34.922 --> 02:38.774
You can't give up!
You've crossed universes.

02:38.795 --> 02:40.995
You have proven magic is real.

02:41.016 --> 02:44.443
- Dude, we've come all this way.
- And we've failed.

02:47.283 --> 02:50.864
- Felix, this isn't you.
- Alice has the talisman.

02:50.885 --> 02:53.691
She'll destroy it
the first chance she gets!

02:54.090 --> 02:56.029
We're finished. Go home.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.589
I never thought I would
feel this way about you.

03:01.487 --> 03:06.027
For the first time in my life,
I'm disappointed.

03:11.471 --> 03:15.013
- Really? First time?
- I was making a point.

03:51.036 --> 03:52.726
What's happening?

03:56.838 --> 03:59.653
Bear, where are you?

04:01.971 --> 04:03.205
Bear!

04:07.177 --> 04:08.870
Stop it!

04:12.336 --> 04:14.031
What are you?

04:27.369 --> 04:30.897
Why are you doing this?
I thought we were friends.

04:31.408 --> 04:35.086
- You want to leave me.
- No, I don't.

04:35.573 --> 04:39.091
- You're lying.
- I am your friend.

04:39.348 --> 04:40.625
Prove it!

04:45.944 --> 04:49.119
I won't leave you alone,
I promise.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.023
Is this what you need?

04:53.043 --> 04:56.957
Yes. It takes all four Elements
to destroy the talisman.

04:57.688 --> 05:01.210
Do we have to? Think of all
the magic we can do with it.

05:02.411 --> 05:05.700
- I'm not taking any chances.
- But look!

05:06.001 --> 05:08.461
What could possibly hurt us now?

05:10.943 --> 05:13.585
Elements we call together.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.877
Erase the magic, quell...

05:16.127 --> 05:19.352
Phoebe, what's wrong?
Phoebe!

05:19.421 --> 05:23.208
- Keep calm!
- I can't... I'm losing control!

05:24.628 --> 05:26.798
Control your emotions.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.474
There's another way.

05:36.856 --> 05:41.862
Don't destroy the talisman -
it's too powerful... too important.

05:42.113 --> 05:45.775
- Get out of here.
- Let me take Andy's place.

05:47.050 --> 05:48.917
Don't be stupid.

05:50.032 --> 05:51.906
I'll go willingly...

05:52.805 --> 05:54.871
And you'll be safe.

05:56.202 --> 05:58.069
You can keep your powers.

06:01.588 --> 06:02.961
It's a fair deal.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.967
The kid has a point.

06:06.563 --> 06:09.056
Neither of you know what it's like.

06:09.318 --> 06:12.649
I'll leave a note,
make it look like I've run away.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.263
That'll keep the police
off our backs.

06:18.275 --> 06:19.895
We have to go to the altar.

06:19.932 --> 06:22.550
And now they've
done something to the detective!

06:22.631 --> 06:25.428
He's brainwashed, or something.

06:25.449 --> 06:28.250
- I'll agree he's a little loopy.
- It's the boys!

06:28.290 --> 06:31.837
Anyone who comes in contact with
them starts acting really weird.

06:31.889 --> 06:35.520
- I don't think that that...
- Look - I've done all this research.

06:35.631 --> 06:38.277
There are ley lines
running all through Bremin.

06:38.329 --> 06:42.442
People have been disappearing near
them for decades - it's all here!

06:42.936 --> 06:45.200
What exactly do you want me
to do with all this?

06:45.220 --> 06:47.239
Put it on the news.
Make them admit it.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.042
- Admit what?
- That they're doing magic!

06:50.124 --> 06:55.031
- As in "Abracadabra"?
- Real magic; real spells.

06:56.113 --> 06:58.891
I'm sorry, this just doesn't
make much sense.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.736
You're gonna have to give me
something more concrete than this.

07:05.663 --> 07:07.904
Want something concrete?

07:12.267 --> 07:13.969
How about that?

07:17.215 --> 07:22.074
- Viv... what are you doing?
- That storm - I've seen it before.

07:22.136 --> 07:23.960
We've all seen storms before.

07:24.032 --> 07:27.475
Whatever happened to Andy,
it's going to happen again.

07:27.551 --> 07:29.796
This happened when Andy disappeared?

07:29.829 --> 07:32.878
Before that too, when they all
disappeared in the forest.

07:33.407 --> 07:37.533
- There was a storm, I remember.
- It's all connected.

07:37.569 --> 07:41.399
Get down here with your camera, fast
as you can; something's happening...

07:41.521 --> 07:44.916
Something very weird.

07:45.650 --> 07:49.910
- So we keep going without Felix? How?
- We'll change his mind.

07:49.931 --> 07:52.296
Felix never changes
his mind about anything.

07:52.315 --> 07:54.737
I say we go to Roland.
He's our best shot.

07:54.758 --> 07:57.102
Stubborn and pig-headed and...

07:58.338 --> 07:59.719
Stubborn!

08:00.738 --> 08:03.375
He hasn't changed
his mind at all, has he?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.537
He's going after Andy by himself!

08:14.666 --> 08:16.530
How did you send Andy?

08:17.243 --> 08:19.757
He sent himself;
I just gave him the words.

08:19.777 --> 08:21.913
- So give them to me.
- Alice...

08:21.934 --> 08:24.419
You're a different elemental power -
they won't be the same.

08:24.440 --> 08:25.756
Alice...

08:26.531 --> 08:27.978
It's happening again.

08:27.998 --> 08:30.050
- Phoebe!
- How do I stop it?

08:30.070 --> 08:33.183
- You have to stay calm.
- I'm really very relaxed!

08:33.203 --> 08:36.113
- You have to control it!
- I can't!

08:36.134 --> 08:37.294
Felix!

08:37.316 --> 08:39.684
- Focus on me!
- I'm trying!

08:39.706 --> 08:42.413
- We have to get out of here!
- Wait, you don't understand!

08:42.433 --> 08:46.680
- No, we completely understand!
- Seriously, dude, now!

08:47.949 --> 08:50.391
Come on, Felix! Please!

08:50.452 --> 08:52.208
Let's go, come on!

08:52.229 --> 08:56.138
Focus! You can do this!
Concentrate!

08:56.425 --> 08:57.954
I can't!

08:57.994 --> 09:01.648
You're stronger than me,
stronger than I ever was.

09:08.104 --> 09:09.705
Here's your proof.

09:10.859 --> 09:14.739
- This means we're brothers.
- I've never had a brother.

09:14.769 --> 09:18.201
Me either; one annoying
sister - and that's it.

09:23.172 --> 09:26.253
I thought you said
this place felt how I felt?

09:32.255 --> 09:34.152
That's not me feeling that.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.827
- It's time.
- Time for what?

09:38.508 --> 09:40.758
Order must be restored.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.235
Bear...?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.232
Bear!

09:53.726 --> 09:57.196
When will you get it, Felix? Swapping
yourself for Andy isn't the answer!

09:57.216 --> 09:58.705
- Then what is?
- I don't know...

09:58.725 --> 10:02.170
I hate to interrupt the love fest, but
I think we have a bigger problem.

10:02.252 --> 10:04.346
- Restoring demon.
- Yep.

10:07.272 --> 10:08.413
Roland!

10:13.088 --> 10:14.711
It won't budge.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.246
He's right in its path.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.668
- Run! Go!
- We're not gonna just leave you!

10:23.712 --> 10:26.849
- Can we break a window?
- No time, it's too close!

10:26.988 --> 10:30.475
I'll be fine!
You go! Go!

10:30.496 --> 10:33.665
We have to lure it away.
Here, restoring demon! Over here!

10:33.741 --> 10:36.928
- Is this really a good idea?
- I don't have a better one.

10:36.949 --> 10:39.325
You think you're fast?
You're not fast!

10:39.357 --> 10:42.881
Yeah, it's working.
This way, come on!

10:43.563 --> 10:46.818
I know I'm supposed to be happy
about that, but really?

10:50.792 --> 10:52.886
Guys, help! My wheel is stuck!

10:53.317 --> 10:55.937
Order must be restored.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.760
- Andy...
- Andy's the restoring demon?

10:59.005 --> 11:01.756
- Just like Alice was!
- He wouldn't hurt us!

11:02.175 --> 11:05.968
- Maybe he doesn't have a choice.
- Let's go!

11:14.119 --> 11:17.522
Bear, how do I stop this?

11:19.308 --> 11:20.545
Bear!

11:24.543 --> 11:27.504
Your body's rejecting the powers;
they're too much for one person.

11:27.525 --> 11:29.727
- No!
- I need to counteract the effects.

11:33.302 --> 11:36.133
- We need the talisman!
- I don't think so.

11:36.638 --> 11:38.813
You want to face that alone?

11:39.836 --> 11:42.492
- What is that?
- The restoring demon.

11:42.513 --> 11:44.684
The talisman should hold it off.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.833
- Make it stop! Help me...
- Phoebe!

11:49.358 --> 11:52.772
OK - do something!

11:54.323 --> 11:58.909
Water, Fire, Earth and Air -
Elements that we all share.

11:59.101 --> 12:04.107
Water, Fire, Earth and Air -
Elements that we all share.

12:04.311 --> 12:09.217
Water, Fire, Earth and Air -
Elements that we all share!

12:15.546 --> 12:17.347
That was not good.

12:23.624 --> 12:28.083
Look - we're friends;
friends look out for each other.

12:28.163 --> 12:30.322
I don't want to do that again.

12:30.937 --> 12:33.457
- You sound like her.
- Alice...?

12:33.478 --> 12:35.147
She left me.

12:40.148 --> 12:41.872
She never understood.

12:42.901 --> 12:46.460
- Help me understand.
- You already do.

12:51.254 --> 12:54.134
It's not gone for good, is it?

12:54.188 --> 12:56.279
We've dissipated its energy
in this world.

12:56.325 --> 12:59.764
But it will be back as long as
there's still a magical disruption...

12:59.785 --> 13:01.633
Which there is.

13:01.716 --> 13:04.241
Phoebe should have never
been given all our powers.

13:05.536 --> 13:07.602
Now they're burning her up.

13:08.462 --> 13:10.833
How long do we have
till that thing reboots?

13:11.168 --> 13:14.347
Not long - we need to swap
the powers back.

13:14.437 --> 13:15.744
So let's do it.

13:17.742 --> 13:19.542
Phoebe!

13:24.189 --> 13:25.416
Phoebe...?

13:27.312 --> 13:31.491
She won't let go of her powers -
she's wanted them for too long.

13:31.793 --> 13:34.492
It might be too late,
even if she does give up her powers.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.071
Well, I won't let that thing
destroy her.

13:38.169 --> 13:40.037
There's one other way.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.411
I won't send her there.
You don't understand.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.952
- It'll save her.
- No!

13:45.972 --> 13:47.625
Quick, she's over here!

13:48.792 --> 13:50.289
Phoebe!

13:53.372 --> 13:54.767
Is she OK?

13:55.065 --> 13:57.413
- What's happened?
- What happened to her?

14:00.070 --> 14:03.697
This place needs a human consciousness
to restore balance, right?

14:05.366 --> 14:08.916
And... and it responds
to my emotions?

14:09.395 --> 14:12.345
If I'm scared, this place is scary.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.932
But if I'm happy, this place is fun.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.346
See? You do know.

14:19.131 --> 14:23.896
So if I'm happy to restore order,
then everything is in balance.

14:24.005 --> 14:25.891
And we're brothers.

14:28.379 --> 14:32.033
Order must be restored -
you must restore it.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.243
Elements that knit and bind,

14:41.343 --> 14:44.894
hear my will, join different kinds.

14:45.422 --> 14:47.120
Nothing's happening.

14:47.338 --> 14:50.659
Why are you fighting me?
Let them go...

14:50.734 --> 14:53.109
After all we went through
to get them...

14:53.128 --> 14:55.646
It doesn't matter -
you're what counts.

14:55.706 --> 14:59.149
I can fight the demon,
I just need to get control.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.256
- There's no time.
- No! They're mine...

15:05.998 --> 15:07.573
It's back!

15:11.954 --> 15:14.314
A twister inside a building?

15:16.475 --> 15:19.903
Help me, please! For Phoebe!

15:22.021 --> 15:24.046
I can't believe I'm doing this.

15:28.429 --> 15:30.917
How exactly are we gonna do this?

15:32.228 --> 15:33.475
Anyone...?

15:37.563 --> 15:40.898
- I think I'm getting the hang of this.
- You are!

15:53.490 --> 15:54.882
Andy...?

15:59.496 --> 16:01.894
He's more powerful
than any of us now.

16:01.965 --> 16:04.772
Are we supposed
to be happy or scared?

16:04.791 --> 16:07.625
Well, I'm freaked
right seriously out.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.180
Phoebe...

16:13.942 --> 16:17.123
It is time - come with me.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.794
No, I won't go with you.

16:23.004 --> 16:26.165
The magical order is out of balance.

16:26.195 --> 16:30.521
- You can't stay here.
- I'll fix it. I'll...

16:32.570 --> 16:34.120
He's right.

16:35.983 --> 16:37.729
It's the only way.

16:40.372 --> 16:41.942
Don't worry...

16:42.273 --> 16:46.118
You won't be alone -
I'm coming with you.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.482
I need to make amends.

16:51.037 --> 16:53.964
Order must be restored.

17:03.927 --> 17:07.987
Elements of the universe -
within and without.

17:08.579 --> 17:13.472
Space be no hindrance -
no barrier, no bar.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.999
Elements of the universe -
within and without.

17:18.316 --> 17:22.836
Space be no hindrance -
no barrier, no bar.

17:23.579 --> 17:25.224
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17:25.246 --> 17:26.390
Guys!

17:26.410 --> 17:27.637
- Andy!
- Andy!

17:27.646 --> 17:29.037
- Whoa, dude!
- Andy!

17:29.058 --> 17:32.919
This place is incredible!
I can control the whole universe!

17:32.940 --> 17:35.839
- Universes, even!
- You have to come home, Andy.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.035
But I promised.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.981
What are you talking about, dude?
This is your chance!

17:40.361 --> 17:43.180
We miss you! Your family misses you!

17:43.800 --> 17:45.896
Andy, please...

17:45.917 --> 17:49.135
I'm not ready.
This is what I've always wanted.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.226
Sorry.

17:56.838 --> 17:59.398
Yeah, a little late, but thanks.

18:03.314 --> 18:05.020
It worked!

18:19.298 --> 18:22.755
What's this?
Is this where you were?

18:23.250 --> 18:25.487
It didn't look like this before.

18:26.527 --> 18:28.123
It's beautiful.

18:32.979 --> 18:37.235
With Phoebe leaving this universe,
order was restored.

18:54.148 --> 18:56.790
Hurry, before the portal closes.

18:58.610 --> 19:01.095
There's someone
I have to say goodbye to.

19:16.575 --> 19:18.472
Andy, you have to go!

19:18.487 --> 19:20.620
Bear! Where did you go?

19:20.640 --> 19:23.549
Hey, kid, come back!
It's closing!

19:23.586 --> 19:26.500
- You're going away!
- Bear!

19:29.383 --> 19:31.956
Bear! Talk to me!

19:32.065 --> 19:35.832
- What's taking him so long?
- Come on, Andy, the portal's gonna close!

19:46.308 --> 19:48.661
This is gonna put me
on prime time.

19:50.782 --> 19:53.768
This is where the twister
disappeared.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.245
You think Andy will be here?

19:57.705 --> 19:59.112
You see that?

20:03.634 --> 20:05.096
Lead the way.

20:11.398 --> 20:14.537
Felix, what's happening?
Where is he?

20:14.604 --> 20:17.725
I've got you on camera...
Whatever it is you're doing.

20:17.741 --> 20:19.630
We're taking cover from the storm.

20:19.649 --> 20:21.897
- Just hanging out.
- Discussing career paths.

20:21.947 --> 20:24.202
Right, I'm sure the cops
will believe that.

20:24.222 --> 20:27.841
- Mia, I can explain all this.
- I can't wait.

20:27.862 --> 20:29.471
What on earth...?

20:31.942 --> 20:33.231
Something's coming.

20:57.289 --> 20:58.922
- It's Andy!
- Andy!

20:58.942 --> 21:00.801
- He's home!
- Andy!

21:02.231 --> 21:03.780
Where did he come from?

21:03.864 --> 21:07.156
- I knew I'd find you!
- Actually, I think I found you.

21:07.177 --> 21:09.829
- You're home!
- Brainy dude!

21:09.849 --> 21:11.987
- Nice entrance, Andy.
- Hi, again.

21:12.008 --> 21:14.365
You're in so much trouble.

21:14.509 --> 21:16.830
- Nice to have you back.
- You missed me, huh?

21:16.868 --> 21:18.879
No, I barely thought about you.

21:19.087 --> 21:23.121
This is gonna be the lead story
on every TV network everywhere.

21:23.206 --> 21:27.547
Andy, where have you been?
What was that thing?

21:27.677 --> 21:29.586
How do you explain this?

21:30.438 --> 21:32.023
What?

21:33.184 --> 21:35.932
Sorry, I think there's something
wrong with your camera.

21:36.011 --> 21:37.395
Did you just...?

21:37.514 --> 21:39.225
You can't do this!

21:41.329 --> 21:43.585
I'm here! What did I miss?

21:44.238 --> 21:47.334
- Andy Lau, I presume.
- Roland!

21:47.591 --> 21:50.146
Yes, right. Tip-top.

21:50.999 --> 21:54.147
Excuse me, Miss, may I have a word?

21:54.796 --> 21:57.087
- We did it!
- You did it.

21:57.106 --> 21:59.275
No - we did it.

21:59.587 --> 22:03.605
- Thanks for not giving up on me.
- Guess I'm as stubborn as you are.

22:10.726 --> 22:12.108
Guys, guys.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.022
Come on, let's go.

22:21.259 --> 22:25.559
So the warehouse exists in this universe,
quantum entangled with the other one.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.061
Same space, different dimensions.

22:28.168 --> 22:30.742
Seriously, dude,
how could you get any nerdier?

22:32.921 --> 22:37.962
- So how does it feel to be home?
- It's good... and a bit strange.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.105
I'm still getting used to it.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.392
You and Felix?

22:43.558 --> 22:46.284
We haven't really
had time to talk about it.

22:46.610 --> 22:48.180
I hope you do.

22:51.475 --> 22:54.543
So I checked the session times.

22:54.564 --> 22:57.038
There's a double feature on
tomorrow night.

22:57.059 --> 23:01.002
- It's a school night.
- Next weekend, then?

23:01.399 --> 23:04.885
- I think I have plans.
- Really?

23:05.314 --> 23:08.599
No, not really.
You're so gullible!

23:09.898 --> 23:13.418
- Nice shirt.
- Dinner at Bates's place after this.

23:13.505 --> 23:16.837
- I'm on my best behaviour.
- "Jake Bates" - suits ya.

23:16.858 --> 23:19.788
- No-one's changing their names.
- Yet.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.146
- You OK?
- Of course.

23:27.828 --> 23:31.100
- What's this?
- Just a reminder.

23:31.581 --> 23:34.386
- Of...?
- A promise I made.

23:34.575 --> 23:37.409
It's OK, you don't have to tell me.

23:37.925 --> 23:41.914
I will, as soon as I figure out
what I'm gonna do about it.

23:42.037 --> 23:44.867
Hey guys, we should take a photo.

23:44.964 --> 23:47.531
- For what?
- Send it to Roland.

23:47.594 --> 23:51.121
You two really did bond over that
whole body swap thing, didn't you?

23:51.142 --> 23:53.487
- He's a good guy.
- OK, come on.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.342
- Get in.
- Oskie...

23:56.468 --> 23:58.726
Say quantum entanglement!

24:00.362 --> 24:02.568
Uh... no. No!

24:19.016 --> 24:20.645
Don't worry.

24:21.809 --> 24:25.126
It didn't happen -
still here, aren't I?

24:25.173 --> 24:29.607
- I drew the future - I know I did.
- Maybe the future changed.

24:32.547 --> 24:34.644
Or maybe it just
hasn't happened yet.
