00:06.367 --> 00:08.169
<i>Previously on</i> Fatal Attraction...

00:08.169 --> 00:10.938
There it is, the face. No wonder
they're gonna make you judge.

00:10.938 --> 00:13.107
Ooh, heard your 40th birthday's
coming up.

00:13.107 --> 00:15.176
That's young for a judge.

00:15.176 --> 00:17.178
So, the appointment?
It's not happening.

00:17.178 --> 00:19.480
What? What are you
talking about?

00:19.480 --> 00:20.781
I'm Alex Forrest.

00:20.781 --> 00:22.750
Alex. Dan Gallagher.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.852
Daniel Michael Gallagher,

00:24.852 --> 00:26.854
convicted of murder
in the second degree,

00:26.854 --> 00:29.123
given a sentence
of 15 years to life.

00:29.123 --> 00:30.891
Every day
that I have been in here,

00:30.891 --> 00:33.227
I have thought
about Alexandra Forrest.

00:33.227 --> 00:34.995
I chose to take her life.

00:34.995 --> 00:36.730
<i>My father might be</i>

00:36.730 --> 00:38.999
up for parole.
<i>I need to say this</i>

00:38.999 --> 00:40.501
<i>even if you don't believe me.</i>

00:40.501 --> 00:42.636
I did not kill that woman
Alex Forrest,

00:42.636 --> 00:44.071
and I'm going to prove it.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.651
And Mike walks in,

00:57.651 --> 00:59.687
said, "Which one of you
is Gallagher? Come here."

00:59.687 --> 01:00.921
- Shit.
- Oh, yeah.

01:00.921 --> 01:03.757
Says, "Look,
your dad is a legend,

01:03.757 --> 01:05.159
"but he's also a prick,

01:05.159 --> 01:07.027
"and there's a lot of people
that would love

01:07.027 --> 01:08.929
"to watch you fuck up
'cause they hate him,

01:08.929 --> 01:10.698
"and he is the reason
you got this job.

01:10.698 --> 01:13.667
But I, Mike, will always
be here to protect you."

01:14.668 --> 01:16.570
And his reward, of course, is...

01:16.570 --> 01:18.906
being send to Pacoima
on Friday night

01:18.906 --> 01:21.675
to see if there's a body
in the trunk.

01:21.675 --> 01:23.611
Is your dad still with us?

01:23.611 --> 01:25.813
- Not even a little.
- Hmm.

01:28.649 --> 01:30.718
Wow, you really were not kidding
about you and meatballs.

01:30.718 --> 01:32.219
In fairness,

01:32.219 --> 01:34.655
there's only, what, like,
seven total ingredients

01:34.655 --> 01:36.290
in a meatball that you can
combine in only so many ways,

01:36.290 --> 01:40.628
and so really, how bad--
or how much better--

01:40.628 --> 01:42.263
could it really get? Really?

01:42.263 --> 01:44.932
So, what you're saying is,
the problem with meatballs

01:44.932 --> 01:46.967
is their extreme reliability?

01:46.967 --> 01:49.136
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

01:49.136 --> 01:50.938
So, we both like meatballs,

01:50.938 --> 01:52.606
- we both like cookies.
- Mm-hmm.

01:52.606 --> 01:54.541
- Conchita.
We both like Conchita.
- Yes.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.310
Man, did you luck out with her.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.779
I mean, we all did, really,
to have a woman like that

01:58.779 --> 02:00.681
in that position
who has seen it all

02:00.681 --> 02:02.182
and still believes in people?

02:02.182 --> 02:03.951
Or really, believes
in believing in people?

02:03.951 --> 02:05.819
That's probably
a better way to put it.

02:05.819 --> 02:08.022
Yeah, saves us all
from becoming cynics.

02:08.022 --> 02:10.624
Right, if that's the goal.

02:11.926 --> 02:13.861
- Go on.
- I think cynicism

02:13.861 --> 02:15.562
is probably the danger
in your lane,

02:15.562 --> 02:18.899
but in ours, it's more...

02:18.899 --> 02:21.168
compassion fatigue?

02:21.168 --> 02:24.838
You know, you see so many
helpless people, wh...

02:24.838 --> 02:28.175
you start to blame them
for their own helplessness.

02:28.175 --> 02:29.777
Hmm.

02:29.777 --> 02:31.712
Okay, well, maybe...

02:31.712 --> 02:35.349
I didn't mean cynicism,
exactly, more...

02:35.349 --> 02:38.018
- a failure of empathy.
- Right.

02:38.018 --> 02:39.987
Right, because if you're
guarding against that,

02:39.987 --> 02:42.756
and you're looking
for the good, then...

02:42.756 --> 02:45.092
it can make you easier to fool.

02:45.092 --> 02:46.794
Right? But You have to keep
reminding yourself,

02:46.794 --> 02:48.295
it's better to be a fool

02:48.295 --> 02:51.765
than be angry at people
for not having power.

02:51.765 --> 02:53.901
Uh, I don't know.
Then again, my dad used to say

02:53.901 --> 02:57.071
that a-a cynic is what
an idealist calls a realist,

02:57.071 --> 02:59.139
so, really,
I guess I have no idea

02:59.139 --> 03:01.709
what I'm telling you right now.

03:01.709 --> 03:03.310
Here's to it all.

03:11.118 --> 03:12.786
I do something to you, Danny?

03:14.755 --> 03:16.323
No. What did I do to you?

03:16.323 --> 03:19.727
'Cause I just got your foot
all the way up my ass,

03:19.727 --> 03:21.862
- so it's got to be something.
- Is this is about
the drive-by case?

03:21.862 --> 03:24.098
17-year-old kid they executed.

03:24.098 --> 03:27.968
Witness ID'd the car and all
four guys, first and last names.

03:27.968 --> 03:29.937
Just charge.
It's your fucking job.

03:29.937 --> 03:31.939
- Two Buds and a 7 and 7.
- You put something down

03:31.939 --> 03:33.173
on your tab right now
or it's closed, Suarez.

03:33.173 --> 03:35.642
Jerry's not saying that.

03:35.642 --> 03:37.711
Because he hasn't seen your tab.
You want me to show him?

03:37.711 --> 03:40.047
I want you to get ass cancer,
chicken dick.

03:40.047 --> 03:42.282
Nice. You're a real prince.

03:48.889 --> 03:50.858
Oh, my God. No, it's okay.
No, don't.
You don't like it.

03:50.858 --> 03:52.793
No, no, no, it's okay.
I will drink it.
- No, no, no.

03:52.793 --> 03:55.129
- I'm gonna drink it.
- You're crying. You're crying.

03:55.129 --> 03:57.231
Okay, we're gonna cross
this off the list, okay?

03:57.231 --> 03:59.833
Don't worry, there are plenty
of other margaritas here,

03:59.833 --> 04:01.902
that are probably
more your speed.

04:01.902 --> 04:03.670
Strawberry? A classic.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.339
Banana?

04:05.339 --> 04:07.841
- Coconut? You say coconut?
- Oh, Jesus.

04:07.841 --> 04:09.243
Okay. Watermelon.

04:09.243 --> 04:11.278
These are my speeds to you?
Excuse me, sir?

04:11.278 --> 04:14.014
Sir, could I have
one of those beers

04:14.014 --> 04:15.416
- that I was drinking earlier?
- Of course.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.185
- Thank you.
- Whoops.

04:22.956 --> 04:26.160
And, you know,
I do like spicy, actually.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.895
Sure you do.

04:27.895 --> 04:30.964
No, like my-my dad
liked camping.

04:32.232 --> 04:33.867
Meaning that I don't?

04:33.867 --> 04:36.170
Meaning that you do,
but you know,

04:36.170 --> 04:38.105
you just like it
until the sun goes down.

04:38.105 --> 04:39.373
And then you pretend
like you're worried

04:39.373 --> 04:41.075
about your daughter
catching a cold

04:41.075 --> 04:43.077
and you blame it
on her mother for...

04:43.077 --> 04:45.479
...not dressing her warmly
enough so you can just go home

04:45.479 --> 04:48.082
- and sleep in your own bed.
- This is gonna feel like
it's not related,

04:48.082 --> 04:50.117
but the other day, I was
driving past a drive-through,

04:50.117 --> 04:52.252
and it reminded me
that my father

04:52.252 --> 04:54.421
would never, ever use
drive-throughs.

04:54.421 --> 04:56.156
He didn't have enough
control over the situation.

04:56.156 --> 04:58.759
So we'd have to park,
we'd go inside,

04:58.759 --> 05:01.161
and then he would just
rule over the proceedings.

05:01.161 --> 05:04.965
My dad, he would always call me

05:04.965 --> 05:07.434
from another room, but he would
never tell me what he wanted.

05:07.434 --> 05:09.103
Right? So I'd have to just
drop everything I was doing,

05:09.103 --> 05:11.305
go to wherever he was,
so he could be like,

05:11.305 --> 05:13.107
"Water is wet."

05:13.107 --> 05:15.943
Anytime anybody would bring up
something that my father

05:15.943 --> 05:17.945
didn't know, he would
just start loudly blaring,

05:17.945 --> 05:19.413
"How is this a topic
of conversation?

05:19.413 --> 05:21.014
Why is this interesting
to anyone?"

05:21.014 --> 05:22.916
One time I made the mistake

05:22.916 --> 05:26.086
of saying that a movie
that he liked was dated--

05:26.086 --> 05:29.289
yeah-- and two hours later,
he's screaming at me

05:29.289 --> 05:32.092
about how he hopes
he never needs a kidney,

05:32.092 --> 05:35.262
because clearly, I would
rather watch him fucking die.

05:35.262 --> 05:36.763
That's a proportionate response.

05:36.763 --> 05:38.332
- Yeah.
- My dad was still complaining

05:38.332 --> 05:40.267
till the day he died about
the guitar he bought me

05:40.267 --> 05:43.337
in fifth grade that didn't
turn me into Eric Clapton.

05:43.337 --> 05:45.105
When did that happen,
by the way?

05:45.105 --> 05:48.175
Were you already head
of Major Crimes when he died?

05:48.175 --> 05:50.277
Uh, no, no. Just about.

05:50.277 --> 05:53.147
- And had he been head
of Major Crimes?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:53.147 --> 05:56.016
No, he was Chief Deputy D.A.,
which allowed him to pretend

05:56.016 --> 05:58.385
- that Major Crimes
was not a big deal.
- Right.

05:58.385 --> 06:03.790
And, of the 35-ish cases
that I worked up to that point,

06:03.790 --> 06:06.460
he did not come to see me
try a single one.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.228
He used say things that implied

06:08.228 --> 06:10.430
that he'd been in court
watching me on this or that day,

06:10.430 --> 06:14.301
and eventually, people just
believed him, so I let them.

06:14.301 --> 06:18.338
Hmm. And what did Mike
have to say about that?

06:18.338 --> 06:20.974
Nothing. I never told him.

06:20.974 --> 06:23.310
I mean...

06:23.310 --> 06:25.412
I actually never told anybody.

06:28.482 --> 06:30.584
Well.

06:30.584 --> 06:32.486
It's probably for the best.

06:32.486 --> 06:34.454
Yeah, no, at this point,
I'm pretty glad

06:34.454 --> 06:35.889
- that he was never there.
- No. No.

06:35.889 --> 06:37.191
I mean because
you're not as good

06:37.191 --> 06:38.892
at your job
as you think you are.

06:40.194 --> 06:42.362
At least 40% of those wins,
the jurors

06:42.362 --> 06:44.398
were probably listening
to a word you said.

06:44.398 --> 06:47.100
They were too busy
watching your mouth.

06:53.207 --> 06:55.042
I'm going to the ladies' room.

06:56.944 --> 06:58.879
- Yeah.
<i>- MIKE
She wasn't there.</i>

06:58.879 --> 07:01.215
- What?
<i>- The trunk.
Sylvie Rubidoh's not in it.</i>

07:01.215 --> 07:04.151
<i>Oh, fuck this fucking shit.
I'm going home.</i>

07:27.407 --> 07:29.876
I wanted to ask you, uh...

07:29.876 --> 07:33.513
what are your thoughts
on Steve Park?

07:34.715 --> 07:36.216
- Fraud Bureau Steve Park?
- Yes.

07:36.216 --> 07:38.051
I've been assigned
to a case of his,

07:38.051 --> 07:40.387
- but I've never met him, so...
- Well,

07:40.387 --> 07:42.956
um... smart guy.

07:44.691 --> 07:46.326
Slightly an enormous
asshole, but...

07:46.326 --> 07:47.995
- Okay.
- ...but a smart guy. Oh!

08:05.078 --> 08:07.581
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, come on.

08:22.162 --> 08:23.563
<i>Sitzfleisch.</i>

08:23.563 --> 08:25.399
That's somebody who has patience

08:25.399 --> 08:27.534
for a lot of mind-numbingly
boring stuff.

08:27.534 --> 08:29.303
They have <i>sitzfleisch.</i>

08:29.303 --> 08:33.140
So, like, when I'm in
case review, that's <i>sitzfleisch?</i>

08:33.140 --> 08:36.109
Exactly. Yeah, "seat meat."

08:36.109 --> 08:38.245
Oh, my favorite one

08:38.245 --> 08:42.215
is when you eat too much
because you're sad or lonely

08:42.215 --> 08:45.519
and you-you put on a couple
pounds of <i>kummerspeck:</i>

08:45.519 --> 08:47.154
"Grief bacon."

08:48.522 --> 08:50.057
<i>Verschlimmbesserung,</i>

08:50.057 --> 08:52.292
that's when you make
a bad situation worse.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.695
Like you're trying
to apologize to somebody

08:54.695 --> 08:58.198
for calling them stupid and
you accidentally call them old.

08:59.399 --> 09:02.536
That is a weirdly
specific example.

09:02.536 --> 09:04.338
Pardon my arm.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.575
Or when you

09:08.575 --> 09:11.078
think about something
that hasn't happened yet,

09:11.078 --> 09:14.648
and all the ways
that it could go: <i>Kopfkino.</i>

09:14.648 --> 09:18.151
"Head cinema."
The movie in your mind.

09:27.594 --> 09:29.396
Thanks for the German lesson.

09:29.396 --> 09:32.165
Feel like I could go over there
and just fit right in.

09:32.165 --> 09:35.001
Oh, yeah. Like a native. Seamless.

09:36.403 --> 09:38.238
Go Huskies.

09:38.238 --> 09:40.707
"Their fighting blood excels."

09:49.349 --> 09:52.319
Thank you for tonight.

09:52.319 --> 09:54.354
It was, uh...

09:54.354 --> 09:56.590
Yeah. Well.

09:56.590 --> 10:00.427
You need one of those
every once in a while, right?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.496
Just to remember...

10:02.496 --> 10:05.766
whatever it is you need
to remember, I don't know.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.168
I was really going
somewhere with that,

10:08.168 --> 10:10.170
but now it's-it's gone.

14:57.463 --> 15:01.000
Oh, my fucking God.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.107
Oh, my fucking God!

15:10.776 --> 15:12.445
Quincy?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.647
Quincy! Get in here right now.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.684
What did you do? What is this?

15:18.684 --> 15:20.986
Since when can you not
make it through the night?

15:22.788 --> 15:23.923
<i>Hello.
Hey, um, my wife</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:25.491
<i>has a full-house deep clean</i>

15:25.491 --> 15:27.626
<i>- scheduled for Tuesday.
- Gallagher.</i>

15:27.626 --> 15:29.395
<i>- You're moving, right?</i>
- Yeah. That's us.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.697
Um, look, I'm sure
this is not possible,

15:31.697 --> 15:33.432
given that it's the weekend
and everything,

15:33.432 --> 15:35.434
but I kind of have
a 911 situation here.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.002
My dog was left alone
for too long

15:37.002 --> 15:39.572
and he kind of tore up
the house.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.407
I already took care
of the hazmat portion,

15:41.407 --> 15:43.576
- but I can still...
<i>- So you need someone today?</i>

15:43.576 --> 15:45.077
<i>Could you do 11:00?</i>

15:45.077 --> 15:47.079
Yes. Yeah. Absolutely.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.081
That is...

15:49.081 --> 15:51.684
Thank you, man.
You are a lifesaver.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.552
<i>Great. We'll see you then.</i>

15:56.922 --> 15:59.158
Hello?
<i>Hey,
Danny. It's me.</i>

15:59.158 --> 16:01.794
Hey.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.096
- Everything okay?
<i>- What? Oh, no, sorry.</i>

16:04.096 --> 16:06.532
<i>Well, Julia's actually
handling the chemo</i>

16:06.532 --> 16:08.868
<i>really well this round
for a change.</i>

16:08.868 --> 16:11.570
<i>Nothing wrong there.</i>

16:11.570 --> 16:13.539
Good. That's good to hear.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.674
<i>Beth asked Julia
to check in with you</i>

16:15.674 --> 16:16.942
<i>while she's off
camping with Ellen,</i>

16:16.942 --> 16:18.744
<i>and Julia asked me to do it.</i>

16:18.744 --> 16:20.079
<i>Anyway, you get it.</i>

16:20.079 --> 16:21.580
<i>Consider yourself
checked in with.</i>

16:21.580 --> 16:24.750
- Yeah, I do. I am.
<i>- Cool.</i>

16:24.750 --> 16:28.053
<i>Oh, and also, while I have you,
about that judge shit?</i>

16:28.053 --> 16:29.822
<i>Hey, just, hey, fuck those guy.</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:32.024
<i>They're making a big mistake.</i>

16:32.024 --> 16:33.659
They don't seem to think so.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.195
<i>Well, they're assholes,
so they wouldn't.</i>

16:36.195 --> 16:38.597
<i>Here if you need us, okay? Bye.</i>

17:03.289 --> 17:04.757
<i>It's weird, every time</i>

17:04.757 --> 17:06.859
I say what a perfect day
would be for me,

17:06.859 --> 17:09.695
it always has
the beach in it, but...

17:09.695 --> 17:12.198
I never come.

17:12.198 --> 17:16.702
I think this is the third time
I've been here since September.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.037
Or the first.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.942
I just like knowing I could,
but I never do, either.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.643
Also, I always
forget that there's

17:24.643 --> 17:26.245
- a lot of wind at the beach.
- Mm.

17:26.245 --> 17:27.947
Yeah. I'm not really
a fan of that.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.250
- Of wind? Really?
- Really.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.918
- Yeah, fuck wind.
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.888
What are some other things
you pretend to like?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.257
Um...

17:38.257 --> 17:39.925
Live music.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.529
My neighbors. Ugh.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.565
Museums.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.033
In fact, I might have to go

17:48.033 --> 17:50.569
a few steps further
and just say art.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.138
Hmm.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.140
Hats. On anyone.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.611
Just so stupid. Why?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.113
- Traveling.
- Ugh. The worst.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.082
Anything that I need
to "develop a taste for."

18:03.082 --> 18:04.917
And the holidays.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.151
- Feedback.
- Mm.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.253
Any kind of feedback.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.921
Mm-hmm. Honesty.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.856
- Listening.
- Other people's success.

18:10.856 --> 18:14.159
- Myself.
- Well, obviously.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.028
Ooh, shit.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.663
What about running on the beach?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.965
- You into that?
- I mean, I'll do it for him.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.901
Come on, puppy.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.769
- Come on, puppy.
- Come here, pup.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.037
Come here, come here, come here.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.698
You look so innocent.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.366
You want a cup to go?

19:27.366 --> 19:29.902
Uh, no, I'm good.
I'm good, thanks.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.037
I'm still wired
after the first one.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.111
Thank you for today.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.849
It was great.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.318
It kind of really was.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.670
Which is just my luck.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.108
Bye, Quincy.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.377
You stay classy, buddy.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.178
He's not making any promises.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.649
<i>BETH No, babe, it's a two-hour drive</i>

20:17.649 --> 20:18.951
<i>from El Capitan with no traffi,</i>

20:18.951 --> 20:20.853
<i>but the kids
want to stop for lunch.</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:22.421
What's this lunch shit?
Just come home already.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.723
<i>You're gonna be at work anyway.</i>

20:24.723 --> 20:26.058
Mm-mm. Maureen promises

20:26.058 --> 20:27.793
she's getting me home
at a decent hour.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.762
So if you're not there
when I get home, big trouble.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.797
<i>Sir, yes, sir.</i>

20:31.797 --> 20:33.732
Mike says hi. Hello?

20:33.732 --> 20:36.435
If you can hear me, I love you.
Drive safe.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.706
They do anything at that school
besides camping?

20:40.706 --> 20:42.875
That's unfair, Mikey.
They also fundraise.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.209
Yes. Yeah.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.712
I'm gonna charge
Evan Rubidoh with murder.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.048
Really? You know
something I don't know?

20:49.048 --> 20:51.250
- Like what?
- Like where Sylvie's body is?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.751
Doesn't matter. We have enough.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.454
Yeah, if you're sure,
you know I am.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.123
Oh, by the way,
he is slightly in the wind.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.693
We're gonna find him,
but... we got to find him.

21:01.693 --> 21:02.961
You just let me know
when you pick him up.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.831
Dang. I hope heaven
is like this.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.199
Hey.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.068
- Hey.
- In case anyone asks,

21:09.068 --> 21:11.470
you and I are reviewing
a case tonight after EOB.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.006
Who's anyone, and what case?

21:14.006 --> 21:15.808
Well, my matricide.
There are a lot of angles.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.876
We will be going late,
and definitely ordering dinner.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.878
And then you'll say we have
to turn off our phones

21:19.878 --> 21:21.280
because we have to concentrate.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.348
Ugh. I hate
to break this to you,

21:23.348 --> 21:25.884
but I'm going home early today.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.886
- What? What-- Why?
- Beth and Ellen are getting home

21:27.886 --> 21:29.922
from camping at El Capitan
this afternoon.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.224
Shit. Um...

21:32.224 --> 21:34.259
Well, um, Phil. Is Phil in here?

21:34.259 --> 21:37.362
You know, he was.
But he got his food to-go.

21:37.362 --> 21:40.199
- Mm. Ballsack.
- Ballsack Phil.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.234
You know, I'd take that face
on you a lot more seriously

21:42.234 --> 21:43.735
if you managed to stay married

21:43.735 --> 21:45.771
for more than a year
at a time, Mikey.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.073
- D'oh.
- I got to go.

21:48.073 --> 21:51.477
Hey, excuse me for preferring
loneliness to shame, Frank.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.288
Shit, I thought
you were the pizza.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.790
Nope.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.926
How was it?

22:07.926 --> 22:10.362
How was four days
of forced intimacy

22:10.362 --> 22:12.464
with the entire second grade
and their parents?

22:12.464 --> 22:14.433
Um...

22:14.433 --> 22:17.002
- How was it?
- You were in the shit.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.437
I saw things I can't unsee.

22:18.437 --> 22:19.972
Well, you're safe now.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.373
Hey, why is there an invoice

22:21.373 --> 22:23.242
from the cleaning service
on the counter?

22:23.242 --> 22:24.943
- Uh...
- I thought they weren't
coming till tomorrow.

22:24.943 --> 22:27.146
And also, what happened
to the couch pillows?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.515
The orange one, the plaid one?

22:29.515 --> 22:32.217
Basically all of them?

22:32.217 --> 22:33.519
Yeah.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.256
Quincy ate them.

22:37.256 --> 22:40.292
What? He never--
He's never done that.

22:41.393 --> 22:42.895
I know, that's what
I thought, too,

22:42.895 --> 22:45.397
but I came home from work
really late on Friday

22:45.397 --> 22:48.500
and he had just gone apeshit
and torn the place up.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.801
How late?

22:49.801 --> 22:52.905
He ate the-the pillows,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.107
his dog bed,
the Patriots blanket,

22:55.107 --> 22:57.242
also, uh, his little
crinkly elephant.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.378
- He ate a basket of magazines?
- What?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.113
Is he okay?
Does he need to go to the vet?

23:01.113 --> 23:02.915
Oh, no. He's fine.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.817
He puked it and shit it all up
all over the house.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.352
Jesus.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.388
Thank God we're moving.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.857
Maybe this will teach you
to hang out all night

23:11.857 --> 23:13.892
like a scoundrel
without a care in the world.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.394
Well, you don't have
to worry about that,

23:15.394 --> 23:16.862
because you're never
going anywhere ever again.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.131
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

23:20.332 --> 23:22.100
Mmm.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.405
Mmm.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.210
Your hair smells like campfire.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.911
What? No it doesn't.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.546
I hate to be the one to break it
to you, but it does.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.582
- I washed it. Ugh.
- I know. It's okay.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.317
I like it. I'm into it.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.919
Yeah, you are.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.355
Hey.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.424
I think your boobs grew.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.125
Seriously,
I think all the s'mores

23:47.125 --> 23:49.361
went right to your boobs.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.503
- Ellen. Ellen.
- What? Oh, my God.

24:00.539 --> 24:04.576
So, you can't fall asleep?

24:04.576 --> 24:06.979
Or you fall asleep
and then you wake up?

24:06.979 --> 24:10.282
- I wake up.
- Hmm.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.951
Any aches or pains?

24:12.951 --> 24:15.287
Maybe down in your legs,
like what we talked about?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.556
- Mm, from me getting taller.
- That's right.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.024
No.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.394
When you wake up,
is it like waking up

24:22.394 --> 24:25.964
from a dream, maybe a bad dream?

24:25.964 --> 24:27.299
No.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.301
But when you wake up,
you're not scared?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.003
No.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.272
Maybe worried, though.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.407
Well, you don't
have to be worried, Sluggo.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.908
That's my job.

24:40.445 --> 24:43.015
You know, I think it's time
maybe we get you a big-girl bed.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.449
Something with feet, maybe?

24:44.449 --> 24:47.552
Not completely on the ground.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.389
If it's on the ground,
then nothing can be under it.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.192
That's a very good point.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.228
Mm-hmm.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.130
<i>His guilt or innocence</i>

24:58.130 --> 25:00.365
isn't on you to determine.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.634
Whether he's guilty
or what he's guilty of...

25:02.634 --> 25:04.503
He says he's not.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.471
None of it
is your responsibility.

25:06.471 --> 25:10.375
Your only responsibility here
is to your own safety.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.544
And setting boundaries with him
that are gonna allow you

25:12.544 --> 25:14.313
to maintain that safety.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.983
Well, I mean, like...

25:19.718 --> 25:21.420
...he has my cell number
and my email,

25:21.420 --> 25:24.556
but he doesn't know
where I live or anything.

25:24.556 --> 25:28.293
And I'm only gonna meet him
in public places for now.

25:28.293 --> 25:32.130
Which you don't ever
have to stop doing.

25:32.130 --> 25:36.435
Just so you know,
you don't ever have to let him

25:36.435 --> 25:39.705
any closer
than you already have.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.208
You don't have to do
any of this, at all.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.278
And you don't have to know
how you feel about it.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.979
About him.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.082
At least, not right now.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.750
I don't know how I feel.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.319
Well, but let me
ask you something.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.523
If you could script this

25:58.523 --> 26:02.661
to be the way
that you wanted it to go,

26:02.661 --> 26:05.263
if you could have
the ideal relationship

26:05.263 --> 26:07.232
with him going forward,

26:07.232 --> 26:09.468
have you thought about
what that would be?

26:14.439 --> 26:16.408
Morning, boss.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.076
Sorry.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.078
So, Judge Watson's
law secretary just called me.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.481
- Okay.
- Watson's publishing
on Maddox tomorrow,

26:22.481 --> 26:24.249
a-and he's denying
defendant's motion to suppress

26:24.249 --> 26:26.184
- the gun in full.
- Well, well, well.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.053
Look at you, developing
your own whisper network.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.789
See you later.

26:30.789 --> 26:33.291
- Good work.
- Thank you.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.072
Hi.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.808
- Hi.
- How's it going?

27:22.808 --> 27:26.311
What if I told you this was
coffee mixed with Red Bull?

27:26.311 --> 27:29.080
Oh, my God. Is that even good?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.750
- Jesus.
- I mean, I can hear colors,

27:31.750 --> 27:33.518
so I don't know
if you think that's good,

27:33.518 --> 27:35.554
but good is subjective, right?

27:37.556 --> 27:39.424
I got to get out of here.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.194
Light them up.
Show them how it's done.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.230
<i>No, I love it.</i>

27:45.230 --> 27:47.265
The voice, the hair.

27:47.265 --> 27:49.334
The hatred of due process.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.404
I-I do have to lock my dog up
when she's on, though,

27:52.404 --> 27:54.272
because her voice
drives him nuts.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.241
Yips his ass off.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.576
Tot Mom Casey Anthony

27:57.576 --> 27:59.377
with her hair in a ponytail,

27:59.377 --> 28:01.279
like some demonic
cheerleader from hell,

28:01.279 --> 28:02.714
- expects us to believe...
- My God.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.450
- Wow.
- She makes it all
seem so simple.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.152
Good, evil.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.387
Guilty as sin,
lying through their teeth.

28:09.387 --> 28:10.889
Big hair, small hair...

28:10.889 --> 28:12.824
- Because she's a nihilist.
- Yeah.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.392
And her eyes
must be dry as shit,

28:14.392 --> 28:15.594
'cause she blinks,
like, twice a show.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.696
So, did you want
to ask me something?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.431
I mean, I'm fine
just talking about Nancy.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.433
Yes, no, I...

28:21.433 --> 28:23.869
I got distracted. I was just
so excited about my lunch.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.437
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

28:25.437 --> 28:26.638
My coma vic,
the one at Saint Matthew's.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.874
Um, yeah, uh, Melissa?

28:28.874 --> 28:30.509
So close. Tracy.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.744
- How's she doing?
- Doctors think she's likely.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.380
And she's all I got
against the ex-boyfriend.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.683
So, if she does go,
of course it becomes a homicide,

28:38.683 --> 28:40.719
but I've got nothing
to charge him with.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.255
I was hoping one of your people
could sit on her.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.657
In case she wakes up,
even for a brief moment,

28:45.657 --> 28:47.692
they can try to get a statement.

28:47.692 --> 28:49.661
Oh, broad-spectrum thinking.
I like it.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.631
Who's the-the woman who
pinch-hit for you on Siddiquis?

28:52.631 --> 28:55.567
- Alice?
- Uh, Alex.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.236
Alex. That's right.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.738
Yeah, I mean, that could work.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.239
Do you want to brief her
or do you want me to...

29:01.239 --> 29:02.641
No, no, no. You got that.
She seemed smart.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.376
I'll have Maureen
send over the details.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.379
Excuse me, excuse me.
All of my people are smart.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.681
Well, excuse me, excuse me,
all of my people are not,

29:09.681 --> 29:11.550
and neither are yours.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.251
Okay, yeah.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.287
Keith's dock doesn't exactly
make it all the way

29:15.287 --> 29:17.355
to the water, I guess.
Oh, hey.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.624
You should be
about to be a judge.

29:42.872 --> 29:44.774
<i>PROFESSOR In the dream Jung
was describing,</i>

29:44.774 --> 29:47.544
<i>he was on the first floor of
a house decorated like his own.</i>

29:47.544 --> 29:50.947
<i>But in one corner,
there was a beautiful staircas,</i>

29:50.947 --> 29:54.350
<i>and when he went down it,
he found a brick cellar,</i>

29:54.350 --> 29:56.619
<i>and in the corner of the floor
there was a stone</i>

29:56.619 --> 29:58.555
<i>with a metal ring.</i>

29:58.555 --> 30:02.725
<i>And he lifted it and below it
were bones and two human skull.</i>

30:02.725 --> 30:04.727
<i>Jung was on a trip
to America with Freud</i>

30:04.727 --> 30:07.463
<i>when he had this dream,
and when he told Freud about i,</i>

30:07.463 --> 30:09.232
<i>Freud said, "Well, obviously,</i>

30:09.232 --> 30:11.200
<i>it means you want
to get rid of your wife."</i>

30:11.200 --> 30:13.503
<i>Hey, Mike. It's Dan.</i>

30:13.503 --> 30:18.541
I am sipping a cup of coffee,

30:18.541 --> 30:20.610
waiting for my daughter.

30:22.645 --> 30:25.415
Have not used a bunch
of those words in a while.

30:27.383 --> 30:28.451
Um...

30:28.451 --> 30:31.621
Look, it'd be good to...

30:31.621 --> 30:33.957
good to catch up, so...

30:33.957 --> 30:36.359
this is my phone number.

30:36.359 --> 30:39.896
I saw your website.
Or webpage, maybe.

30:39.896 --> 30:43.399
I don't know,
not the most modern...

30:43.399 --> 30:46.569
Whatever. Um...

30:46.569 --> 30:49.372
Yeah, I just, I hope
to hear from you soon.

30:50.373 --> 30:51.941
Thanks, bye.

30:56.446 --> 30:58.314
<i>Jung called that process</i>

30:58.314 --> 30:59.816
<i>of uncovering
the aspects of self</i>

30:59.816 --> 31:02.685
<i>hidden in our unconscious
"individuation."</i>

31:05.722 --> 31:09.659
<i>The first stage was to confront
what he called the persona,</i>

31:09.659 --> 31:12.528
<i>a structure made up
of the societal masks we wear.</i>

31:12.528 --> 31:17.400
<i>Child, parent, boss,
friend, lover.</i>

31:19.869 --> 31:22.338
<i>And to confront those masks
and separate them</i>

31:22.338 --> 31:24.507
<i>from our true self.</i>

31:24.507 --> 31:27.276
<i>The next stage of individuation</i>

31:27.276 --> 31:30.046
<i>is confrontation
with our shadow.</i>

31:40.757 --> 31:43.326
- Sorry.
- Oh.

31:43.326 --> 31:45.695
I should have coughed
or something.

31:45.695 --> 31:49.932
I-I just wanted
to update you on Tracy.

31:49.932 --> 31:51.934
- Sims.
- There's an update?

31:51.934 --> 31:54.737
Yes. Uh, well, I mean, not...

31:54.737 --> 31:56.839
Not for long.
She's unconscious again,

31:56.839 --> 31:58.841
but I was able to talk to her.

31:58.841 --> 32:01.778
- Okay.
- And she ID'd him.

32:01.778 --> 32:06.449
Jonathan Coleman. She said
he was the one who beat her.

32:06.449 --> 32:08.785
Would you, please, come in?

32:10.720 --> 32:14.390
The nurses, they seem to be
a bit more optimistic?

32:15.425 --> 32:17.026
Uh, what do I know? But...

32:17.026 --> 32:18.861
worse comes to worst,
I'll at least be able

32:18.861 --> 32:22.065
to officially testify
to her dying declaration, so...

32:22.065 --> 32:23.700
Thank Jesus.

32:28.771 --> 32:30.540
Go home with a victory.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.408
- You earned it.
- Thanks.

32:34.143 --> 32:36.045
But I have so much
catch-up to do.

32:36.045 --> 32:39.615
Some idiot has been making me
hang out at the hospital

32:39.615 --> 32:42.685
until all hours
on this case of his.

32:42.685 --> 32:43.853
- What?
- Yeah.

32:43.853 --> 32:45.722
- Fuck that guy.
- So, anyway,

32:45.722 --> 32:49.492
think I'm gonna go outside
and get some fresh air,

32:49.492 --> 32:51.694
- wake myself up a bit.
- Such as it is.

32:51.694 --> 32:54.964
The sidewalks this time of year
have a complicated aroma.

32:54.964 --> 32:56.933
Sidewalks? No, no, no. No.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.702
Sidewalks are for suckers.
I'm going to the roof.

32:59.702 --> 33:02.038
- Have you never
been to the roof?
- I have never even heard

33:02.038 --> 33:04.373
- of anyone going up there.
- Or nobody told you about it,

33:04.373 --> 33:06.476
because they wanted it
to stay cool.

33:07.577 --> 33:09.011
- Mm.
- To be fair,

33:09.011 --> 33:10.780
it's not
the commonest knowledge.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.048
And, you know,
there's always a chance

33:12.048 --> 33:14.817
that somebody realizes
that the jamb

33:14.817 --> 33:17.019
to the fire door
needs to be replaced.

33:17.019 --> 33:18.121
Wait, wait, wait.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.822
Are you actually concerned

33:19.822 --> 33:22.458
that something broken in
this building might get fixed?

33:23.593 --> 33:24.994
Well, now you know.

33:26.929 --> 33:30.633
And when you speak of me,
speak well.

34:45.842 --> 34:47.677
Windy up here.

34:48.711 --> 34:50.780
Fuck wind.

35:31.158 --> 35:34.629
Your CSRA and COMPAS
assessments already qualify you.

35:34.629 --> 35:36.163
- Okay.
- And you already have

35:36.163 --> 35:39.000
- your parole agent referral.
- I do?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.003
No, I-I do. Yeah, I do.

35:43.971 --> 35:45.873
Well, look, even if you don't,
you can self-refer,

35:45.873 --> 35:48.709
and they'll just reach out
to her and verify it directly.

35:50.211 --> 35:52.647
Can you hold on for one sec?

35:57.818 --> 36:01.322
What the hell happened to you?

36:01.322 --> 36:02.990
Lot of things.

36:05.192 --> 36:07.728
You know, I'm pretty sure
I just gave you my phone number,

36:07.728 --> 36:09.597
- not my address.
- I'm pretty sure I knew

36:09.597 --> 36:13.134
where you were getting
paroled to before you did.

36:13.134 --> 36:15.770
Hope you brought a hat.
Sun's bright as shit.

36:17.405 --> 36:18.973
<i>You know, curfew,</i>

36:18.973 --> 36:20.775
dining hall's always packed,

36:20.775 --> 36:22.710
they got an itinerary
of where I can be and when.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.779
Eh, some things
are pretty much the same.

36:24.779 --> 36:26.714
Yeah.

36:26.714 --> 36:29.583
Except now I can smell jasmine.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.952
You smell the jasmine, huh?

36:30.952 --> 36:32.320
I spent 90 minutes in traffic

36:32.320 --> 36:33.988
with gout in my foot
and a shattered wrist

36:33.988 --> 36:35.623
to see you for the first time
in ten years,

36:35.623 --> 36:37.291
you want to talk
about fucking jasmine?

36:37.291 --> 36:39.260
That it? You look
like shit by the way.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.962
Your skin's the color
of old baloney.

36:41.963 --> 36:42.997
That's why no hat.

36:42.997 --> 36:44.598
I need the vitamin D.

36:44.598 --> 36:46.634
You know, I don't
give a shit what you need.

36:48.369 --> 36:50.071
I don't give a shit
what you can smell.

36:50.071 --> 36:52.273
You think you're, you think
you're still cute, Dan?

36:52.273 --> 36:54.675
You think this
is still fucking cute?

36:56.310 --> 36:58.145
I know, Mike.

37:05.186 --> 37:07.355
What do you want?

37:13.761 --> 37:16.797
I want you to help me find
a copy of my old case file.

37:16.797 --> 37:18.899
I want to go in and open it up,
look at everything

37:18.899 --> 37:20.234
right from the start,
but I need you

37:20.234 --> 37:22.203
to help me find a copy.

37:22.203 --> 37:26.173
Or at least just tell me
where I should start looking.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.145
In the garage.

37:31.145 --> 37:32.847
What garage?

37:32.847 --> 37:33.848
At my house.

37:33.848 --> 37:35.816
Really?

37:38.853 --> 37:40.821
The same old place,
over in Culver?

37:40.821 --> 37:42.356
In Glendale.

37:45.726 --> 37:47.728
Glendale is... out by your mom.

37:47.728 --> 37:49.764
That's nice.
It is nice. It's her house.

37:49.764 --> 37:51.899
She's my landlord.

37:57.038 --> 37:59.106
I feel the first thing we do
is rerun all the prints

37:59.106 --> 38:01.308
that were found on the scene
that weren't yours.

38:01.308 --> 38:04.378
15 years is a long time.
Especially in print tech.

38:04.378 --> 38:06.247
You know, everywhere else, too,
for God's sake.

38:06.247 --> 38:09.250
And maybe some people who
weren't printed or arrested

38:09.250 --> 38:11.719
15 years ago have been
arrested by now.

38:11.719 --> 38:13.788
- How about that?
- That's fantastic.

38:15.222 --> 38:18.392
Yeah. It is.

38:20.327 --> 38:22.129
Oh, and Mom didn't coil
the garden hose,

38:22.129 --> 38:23.964
so I fucking tripped on it,
is what happened.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.002
And gout. You're like a...

38:28.002 --> 38:31.005
character from a fucking
Charles Dickens novel.

38:31.005 --> 38:33.741
I'm not sure what that means,

38:33.741 --> 38:35.376
but I will flush you
down the toilet.

38:39.847 --> 38:41.816
<i>Well, it's the part of your
personality that scares you.</i>

38:41.816 --> 38:44.051
Right? That you repress,
or reject.

38:44.051 --> 38:46.053
And most of us-- we don't even
know that we're doing it.

38:46.053 --> 38:49.323
But, like, if you've ever
asked yourself, like,

38:49.323 --> 38:51.392
"Am I a bad person?"

38:51.392 --> 38:53.060
You know, like the thought
that you had

38:53.060 --> 38:55.129
or the thing that you did
that made you think that,

38:55.129 --> 38:57.298
that's your shadow.

38:59.233 --> 39:01.268
Gee, thanks.

39:01.268 --> 39:03.237
So, what's Jung saying, then?

39:03.237 --> 39:05.206
That we all need to start
thinking about our shadows?

39:05.206 --> 39:07.374
Mm-hmm, yeah, because you can't
ever really know yourself

39:07.374 --> 39:09.009
unless you do.

39:09.009 --> 39:11.178
And then if...
if you don't, just means

39:11.178 --> 39:12.980
that you're not controlling
your shadow.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.315
Your shadow's controlling you.

39:19.253 --> 39:20.955
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:20.955 --> 39:23.757
Well, I was gonna call first,
but then...

39:23.757 --> 39:25.759
- You remembered
you don't do that.
- Yeah.

39:25.759 --> 39:27.862
I just show up. Hi.

39:27.862 --> 39:29.330
- Good to see you.
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:29.330 --> 39:31.499
- Hi, kid.
- Hey, how's it going?
Nice to see you.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.200
You had to figure
we'd be expecting you.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.002
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'll move this thing.

39:35.002 --> 39:38.038
- Ah, he won't mind.
- Okay, well, I won't stay long.

39:38.038 --> 39:39.840
- Ah, yeah, you will.
- Okay, good.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.443
- Okay.
- Hey, hon.
- Hi.

39:42.443 --> 39:45.479
How is school?
What have you learned?

39:45.479 --> 39:47.448
So, I went to see
where they put him,

39:47.448 --> 39:50.951
and it's decent, it's not shady.

39:50.951 --> 39:52.386
He lucked out.

39:52.386 --> 39:54.855
- Hmm.
- He said something
about seeing you?

39:54.855 --> 39:57.391
Yeah.
He told her

39:57.391 --> 39:59.527
that he's going to try
to prove he didn't kill Alex.

39:59.527 --> 40:02.429
Oh.
Does that violate
his parole?

40:02.429 --> 40:04.431
Does what violate it?

40:04.431 --> 40:07.034
- To lie to the board
at his hearing?
- Oh.

40:07.034 --> 40:09.103
If he was under oath, yeah,
but he wasn't, so,

40:09.103 --> 40:10.971
the only thing that can
violate it now is him committing

40:10.971 --> 40:13.073
another crime,

40:13.073 --> 40:16.010
and I'm going to help him prove

40:16.010 --> 40:18.045
that he didn't commit
the first one.

40:18.045 --> 40:20.247
You are?

40:20.247 --> 40:23.417
- Why?
- Why am I gonna do it?

40:23.417 --> 40:25.252
Why does it have to be done?

40:25.252 --> 40:27.354
Unless you've changed your mind
about something

40:27.354 --> 40:29.123
and didn't tell me,
I feel like you know why.

40:29.123 --> 40:32.259
I feel like if I lost 15 years
of my life to that woman,

40:32.259 --> 40:34.595
I wouldn't want
to risk losing the rest of it.

40:34.595 --> 40:37.031
Especially if I didn't kill her.

40:37.031 --> 40:40.901
I feel like I would have learned
by now, the house never loses.

40:40.901 --> 40:43.370
Two of you didn't get your asses
kicked enough the first time?

40:43.370 --> 40:47.107
Right, yup, you're gonna do it,
no matter what I say, so...

40:47.107 --> 40:50.377
That's the spirit. You?

40:50.377 --> 40:52.513
Hmm?

40:52.513 --> 40:55.349
Yeah, I feel like if he feels
like he needs to do it,

40:55.349 --> 40:57.851
then he does.

41:02.256 --> 41:03.924
Hey, good boy.

41:03.924 --> 41:05.359
Yeah, I gotcha. Hello.

41:05.359 --> 41:07.928
- Hey, Dad.
- Sorry I'm late, but some

41:07.928 --> 41:10.097
asshole's in my spot
in the driveway.

41:10.097 --> 41:11.465
I mean, who does that?

41:11.465 --> 41:13.000
Good to see you. Aw.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.069
Doing good?
- How you doing?

41:15.069 --> 41:16.904
Good to see you, too.

41:16.904 --> 41:18.272
- It's like it's been forever.
- I know, yeah.

41:18.272 --> 41:20.307
Mike, what's going on?

41:20.307 --> 41:21.976
- Good to see you.
- Always.

41:21.976 --> 41:23.310
<i>Mikey.</i>

41:23.310 --> 41:25.212
- Hey.
- Oh, is that for me?

41:25.212 --> 41:26.647
You shouldn't have.

41:26.647 --> 41:29.416
- All yours.
- How's it going?

41:29.416 --> 41:32.386
Well, I got bad news. Or, news.

41:33.420 --> 41:35.189
So, Evan Rubidoh
wasn't going home.

41:35.189 --> 41:36.957
He wasn't picking up
his last paycheck, either.

41:36.957 --> 41:38.926
So I put out an alert,

41:38.926 --> 41:41.095
and San Diego, too,
since his family's down there.

41:41.095 --> 41:42.563
Newhall PD found him

41:42.563 --> 41:44.031
parked behind the church,
one to the head.

41:44.031 --> 41:45.332
Been there a couple days.

41:45.332 --> 41:47.334
Note to his sister
in his pocket.

41:47.334 --> 41:49.136
Damn.

41:49.136 --> 41:50.537
Yeah, fuck.

41:50.537 --> 41:53.240
It mention Sylvie in the note?

41:53.240 --> 41:55.042
Hmm.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.283
Sorry. I thought
you saw me standing over there,

42:02.283 --> 42:04.151
and I didn't want to be rude.

42:04.151 --> 42:06.520
But now I can tell
that you did not see me

42:06.520 --> 42:08.589
standing over there. Sorry.

42:08.589 --> 42:11.558
No. Uh, Alex Forrest,
Victims Services.

42:11.558 --> 42:13.160
- Works with Conchita.
- Ah.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.928
This is Mike Gerard,
Investigative Bureau.

42:14.928 --> 42:17.131
The guy who took you
under his wing.

42:17.131 --> 42:19.333
- The very one.
- So what happened?

42:19.333 --> 42:22.436
Was she in the trunk?
Sylvie Rubidoh?

42:23.504 --> 42:25.372
We were just talking
about that. No.

42:25.372 --> 42:27.341
Yeah, everybody's talking
about that, I guess. Shit.

42:27.341 --> 42:31.011
Sorry. So, what happens next?

42:31.011 --> 42:33.380
We look somewhere else.

42:34.348 --> 42:35.949
Well, that makes sense.

42:35.949 --> 42:39.586
Okay, I am going
to get this home

42:39.586 --> 42:41.355
while it's still hot.

42:41.355 --> 42:43.457
Nice to meet you. Good night.

42:43.457 --> 42:45.626
Good night.

42:51.398 --> 42:54.501
You want
to get something to eat?

42:54.501 --> 42:57.705
How about... oreganata,
or maybe some hot antipasto?

42:57.705 --> 42:59.340
Yeah, I could do that.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.077
You know,
if you were a different guy,

43:03.077 --> 43:04.645
I would tell you to be careful
right now, but you're not

43:04.645 --> 43:07.481
a different guy, are you?

43:07.481 --> 43:09.116
What are you talking about?

43:09.116 --> 43:10.617
Please.

43:10.617 --> 43:12.586
What? 'Cause this?

43:12.586 --> 43:14.588
Somebody I work with comes up
to talk to me, and we're what?

43:14.588 --> 43:17.091
Oh, come on, let's not act like
I'm somebody who doesn't know.

43:17.091 --> 43:18.425
Really? You could tell
all of that

43:18.425 --> 43:19.727
just from
that little interaction?

43:19.727 --> 43:21.261
Danny, don't make me
into somebody

43:21.261 --> 43:22.629
you got to lie to, too, please.

43:22.629 --> 43:24.264
Do me that fucking favor.

43:24.264 --> 43:26.133
Do me the favor
and just spare me

43:26.133 --> 43:27.701
the patronizing
paternal disappointment.

43:27.701 --> 43:29.570
It's not paternal,
it's just the regular kind.

43:29.570 --> 43:31.438
What is this? You're just gonna
go straight to 11?

43:31.438 --> 43:32.773
No benefit of the doubt,
no questions asked,

43:32.773 --> 43:34.608
just right to the worst thing?

43:34.608 --> 43:37.044
Oh, right, excuse me. Nothing
to see here. You're right.

43:37.044 --> 43:38.178
- My apologies.
- Fuck you, Mike.

43:38.178 --> 43:40.647
Ah, come on.

43:42.216 --> 43:43.517
<i>Hello?</i>

43:43.517 --> 43:45.586
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>

43:45.586 --> 43:47.621
Yeah, they got a situation
up at Men's Central Jail.

43:47.621 --> 43:49.723
<i>- No.</i>
- And Frank's supposed
to be on call,

43:49.723 --> 43:51.525
but he's not answering,
and they can't track him down,

43:51.525 --> 43:53.327
- so, I got to go.
<i>- Fucking Frank!</i>

43:53.327 --> 43:54.661
I know, right?

43:54.661 --> 43:56.163
<i>So what does that mean for you?</i>

43:56.163 --> 43:58.198
I'm not sure.
There was a fight,

43:58.198 --> 43:59.733
and apparently,
one of the inmates got killed,

43:59.733 --> 44:01.769
so now they all need
to be interviewed right away.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.270
<i>Oh, well, this sucks.</i>

44:03.270 --> 44:04.705
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

44:04.705 --> 44:06.640
<i>No, because I'm
at the office, remember?</i>

44:06.640 --> 44:08.475
<i>You were supposed to be home
to take over from my parents?</i>

44:08.475 --> 44:10.511
- Shit.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:10.511 --> 44:12.479
That's right. I'm so sorry.

44:12.479 --> 44:14.782
<i>It's fine. Just, um,
by the time I get there,</i>

44:14.782 --> 44:17.451
<i>they'll be two drinks in,
so they got to sleep over.</i>

44:17.451 --> 44:19.153
<i>Okay, shit. I got to go.</i>

44:19.153 --> 44:20.687
<i>I love you. Be careful.</i>

45:56.617 --> 45:59.620
Huh. Can't get out of here
fast enough.

45:59.620 --> 46:02.256
Three minutes after you come,
you're already dressed.

46:02.256 --> 46:05.425
What? No.

46:05.425 --> 46:06.860
Oh, no,
you're not already dressed?

46:09.796 --> 46:11.498
Well, it's late.

46:11.498 --> 46:13.901
It's early.

46:18.338 --> 46:19.706
Did I do something?

46:19.706 --> 46:21.742
Not yet, not if you take
all of that off,

46:21.742 --> 46:23.844
fuck me again.

46:26.713 --> 46:28.382
I can't.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.222
You better hurry.

46:35.222 --> 46:36.790
It's not the walk of shame
if nobody sees you.

46:36.790 --> 46:38.959
This is not a walk of shame.

46:38.959 --> 46:41.194
Okay, well, then,
you should stay.

46:41.194 --> 46:42.963
I can't.

46:42.963 --> 46:45.699
Why can't you?

46:47.668 --> 46:51.371
I didn't think
that this is what we were doing.

46:52.940 --> 46:55.309
What <i>were</i> we doing?

46:57.711 --> 47:00.213
Really, what were we doing?

47:00.213 --> 47:03.917
Alex, I'm sorry,
but I really do have to go.

47:03.917 --> 47:07.321
Well, then,
you really should go.

48:04.611 --> 48:07.280
Since I won't be able
to ask you later,

48:07.280 --> 48:09.616
what do you think it would take?

48:10.984 --> 48:12.953
No, wait. That's...

48:12.953 --> 48:14.921
That's not what I meant to say.

48:14.921 --> 48:20.427
Um... I meant to say how many
do you think it would take?

48:21.728 --> 48:23.430
How many what?

48:25.399 --> 48:26.833
Pills.

48:26.833 --> 48:28.935
Why?

48:30.737 --> 48:32.606
Did you take something, Alex?

48:34.574 --> 48:36.610
Hmm. What did you take?

48:36.610 --> 48:39.312
I don't know.

48:39.312 --> 48:40.947
But I took all of them.

48:51.591 --> 48:54.695
What did you take, Alex?!

48:54.695 --> 48:58.065
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

48:58.065 --> 49:01.601
Okay.

49:01.601 --> 49:03.670
Okay, we need
to call 911 right now.

49:03.670 --> 49:06.339
Or-or there's
the-the medical care center,

49:06.339 --> 49:07.774
and my car's
right across the street.

49:07.774 --> 49:09.943
I can take you there.
Is that what you want?

49:09.943 --> 49:12.012
Is that what you want?!

49:12.012 --> 49:14.548
Yes? Yes?

49:14.548 --> 49:16.983
Okay, um, grab your keys

49:16.983 --> 49:19.720
and your wallet and a coat.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.788
Come on, we got to go right now.

49:27.961 --> 49:30.397
Hey, hey.

49:30.397 --> 49:32.065
You with me?

50:00.660 --> 50:02.729
See? We made it.

50:09.035 --> 50:11.705
I just want to say this
before it's too late.

50:13.006 --> 50:14.741
We're gonna go in there,

50:14.741 --> 50:16.543
and we're gonna tell them
what's happening,

50:16.543 --> 50:18.478
and they will help you.

50:21.014 --> 50:22.716
And after that,
we're not gonna be able

50:22.716 --> 50:25.051
to control anything
that happens

50:25.051 --> 50:27.954
because no one ever can.

50:29.222 --> 50:32.626
A doctor or a nurse,

50:32.626 --> 50:37.497
or someone thinks that
there's illegal drugs involved,

50:37.497 --> 50:39.933
or even if it turns out

50:39.933 --> 50:42.636
you don't have any drugs
in your system at all,

50:42.636 --> 50:46.039
someone calls the cops,
they file a report

50:46.039 --> 50:49.509
saying they think
you're suicidal...

50:50.277 --> 50:52.479
...you will be fired.

50:57.584 --> 51:00.787
None of which matters at all
if you still need to go in.

51:00.787 --> 51:02.455
No.

51:03.256 --> 51:05.458
No.

51:08.228 --> 51:10.130
- Are you sure? Because...
- Just...

51:11.064 --> 51:12.799
I just want to go home.

get you something to drink,
you can take a deep breath.
