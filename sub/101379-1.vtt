WEBVTT

02:17.262 --> 02:18.889
We can't afford
any of these houses.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.807
Look, Daddy's gonna help
with the downpayment.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.351
He doesn't even like me.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.936
Oh, he just doesn't know you
well enough yet.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.357
This is it?
It can't be,
this is like a palace.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.192
I think this is the place.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.985
This is it?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.529
Well, there's Edna's car.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.865
- Okay, Mr. Bad Cop.
- Mm-hmm.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.076
- What's the plan?
- Okay, we've seen, what?

02:39.076 --> 02:42.120
- Six, seven houses already?
- Eleven.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.915
Eleven, right.
Yeah, perfect. Okay.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.167
We go in there stone-faced.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.711
- Stone-faced.
- We show zero emotion, okay?

02:49.711 --> 02:52.005
No matter how much
we love this place,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.549
we got to keep
our poker faces, okay?

02:54.549 --> 02:55.967
I'll be bad cop.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.888
Hey, you two!

02:59.888 --> 03:04.184
- Shut up and take our money.
- I knew you'd like it.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.770
Why don't you two
follow me into the kitchen?

03:06.770 --> 03:07.896
Poker face?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.026
Oh, holy shit, this kitchen!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.987
Wow.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.408
I mean, I wanna learn
how to make soufflÃ©s
in this kitchen.

03:19.408 --> 03:23.286
This coming from a man
who can't even microwave
hot dogs in my apartment?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.038
You're goddamn right.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.750
Impressed.
So, what's the catch?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.143
Holy shit, this backyard!

03:46.143 --> 03:49.062
- Shut up and take our money.
- Uh-huh.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.731
It's one of the largest
yards in the area.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.610
Great for barbecues
and summer fun and debauchery.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.364
Look at this pool.
You know what that means?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.825
- Aqua-aerobics.
- Aqua-aerobics nude.

04:01.825 --> 04:06.329
Does every one of your scenarios
involve me being naked?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.581
I mean, I don't know.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.626
Uh... what's that noise?

04:11.626 --> 04:14.004
- What?
- That... like that loud...

04:14.004 --> 04:15.672
It's like a...

04:15.672 --> 04:17.924
-  Throbbing.
- I don't hear anything.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.802
- Okay.
- There's definitely like a...

04:20.802 --> 04:22.179
Throbbing bass line.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.389
It's pretty loud.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.099
- Oh, that.
- Yeah. Yes.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.351
That's nothing.
That's absolutely nothing.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.855
There's just someone
in the guest house.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.608
- Oh. Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.671
Are you guys here for the party?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.090
- Hell no.
-  Wait. Wait, wait.
Come back, come back!

04:59.090 --> 05:00.759
- I've seen enough.
Thank you, that's enough.
- Thank you, that's great.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.010
No, guys, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.470
- Trust me.
- No.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.388
He'll be out of here
in a month.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.724
You could use it
as rental property.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.146
Twenty-four hour notice, Edna.
Twenty-four hour notice.
You know that shit.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.942
I texted you,
faxed you, DM'd you.
I hit you up on MySpace!

05:16.942 --> 05:20.278
Well, you know I don't check
my social media platforms
or my text messages

05:20.278 --> 05:22.697
when I'm fucking on
hallucinogenics.

05:22.697 --> 05:26.952
Oh, but somehow
you managed to respond
with a dick pic.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.412
Yeah, and you should be
thanking me. That was
my penis's good side.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.039
Your penis looked depressed.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.501
Well, here it is, guys.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.419
This is it.
This is the guest house.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.713
Okay? It's a smaller version
of the big house,

05:38.713 --> 05:42.384
except for it smells
like bongwater and K-Y.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.469
Okay, you seen's it,
now take off.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.595
I think I'm gonna be sick.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.556
Oh, go. Spatch, spatch!

05:47.556 --> 05:48.974
Sarah!

05:50.392 --> 05:52.060
It's not that bad!

05:52.060 --> 05:53.270
Mm.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.482
- Wanna smoke some weed, bro?
- Oh, no, no, I'm good.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.276
Thank you so much,
but, uh, no.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.486
I haven't smoked anything
in a really long time, so...

06:01.486 --> 06:04.197
- Ahem. Mm.
- Yeah. Great. Okay.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.783
You got so much cool,
random stuff in here.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.994
Yeah, well, I'm a collector
of old artifacts.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.996
- Oh, my God, you have a bomb!
- Yeah.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.248
- That's so cool.
- That's cool. But what about
this right here?

06:13.248 --> 06:16.167
This is Tommy Lee's sex swing.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.420
Right on. Great.
Uh... cool.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.130
All right, listen.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.257
- Let's get down
to brass tacks here.
- Okay.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.925
What is it,
what's your name? Blake?

06:23.925 --> 06:25.427
- Blake, yeah.
- Blake, yeah, take a seat.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.012
So, here's the deal,
let me just ask you a question.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.555
Are you guys really thinking
about buying this place,

06:28.555 --> 06:30.682
or you just passing through?

06:30.682 --> 06:33.393
Well, actually, you know,
I-I think we're pretty
serious about it.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.813
We-we really... Okay.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.857
- Really? Here, you want?
- Yeah. No, no, no.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.233
That's not why
I was looking at it.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.194
It's Peruvian,
just came in from El Chapo.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.238
Wow. It's still morning.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.781
Yeah, it's pretty great.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.117
Listen, um,
if you buy the place...

06:51.036 --> 06:53.288
If you buy it, right,
I mean, I could stay
in the guest house, right?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.664
I'll pay rent and shit.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.750
- We're good, right? Straight?
- Uh...

06:56.750 --> 06:59.252
Well, that sounds awesome,
it really does,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.379
but, you know,
we're thinking, like,
we buy the place...

07:01.379 --> 07:03.548
No, I'm good.
Thank you. It's...

07:03.548 --> 07:06.760
Uh, we're thinking
if we buy the place,
we'd want access to all of it.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.053
- Which would include
the guest house.
- Mm.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.929
You... you understand.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.681
Copy, copy, gotcha, gotcha.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.308
- All right.
- Well, this was awesome.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.768
Uh, very nice to meet you Mr...

07:14.768 --> 07:17.646
Cockfield.
Randy Cockfield.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.356
- Bye-bye.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.441
Bye, thank you.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.526
- Bye.
- Mm...

07:23.526 --> 07:25.320
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- I know.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.113
But we have to give him time to
move out.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.823
I know, Edna told me.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.159
I just don't feel comfortable
allowing some weirdo

07:31.159 --> 07:33.078
to live in our guest house
for three months.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.205
Do you think
we could get him out quicker?

07:35.205 --> 07:39.709
I don't know.
I mean, he's like
an entrepreneur collector guy.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.461
You know, you saw
all of his stuff.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.047
What kind of entrepreneur
lives in someone's guest house?

07:44.047 --> 07:45.965
A frugal one?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.801
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't sit down

07:47.801 --> 07:49.844
and talk with him about all
of his finances and everything.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.722
Look, I know
that this is weird. I do.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.141
- You think?
- But aren't you tired?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.018
I'm so tired.
I just wanna...

07:57.018 --> 08:00.480
I wanna just lay down.
I wanna be home.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.566
And just say, "We live here now,
we're not going anywhere."

08:03.566 --> 08:05.151
I do love that yard.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.861
And the--
What about the gazebo?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.037
Promise me
he'll be out soon.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.872
That guy gives off
weird vibes.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.959
I pinky promise.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.131
I'm serious, babe.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.675
I-- I'm serious.
I promise.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.009
As soon as
we get settled in here,

08:30.009 --> 08:32.053
I will march right out there,
and I'll say,

08:32.053 --> 08:34.723
"You gotta get out of here
in three months."

08:34.723 --> 08:37.809
He's gonna end up... a week.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.227
We can get him
out of there in a week.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.323
- We're doing it.
- We are.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.160
- We are doing this.
- Yeah. This is us.
We're doing this.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.012
- I mean...
- Oh...

09:14.012 --> 09:16.473
I love this photo.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.183
Well, take a look at this.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.025
- Later, brah.
- Later... brah.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.031
Oh, yeah.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.241
- Dude, what the fuck?!
- Give it to me.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.410
Look, if you guys are gonna
have sex, can you at least
close the door?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.245
Close it and join us.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.289
-  Yeah!
Come join us, Blake.
- No.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.291
Look, we need to set a time
for you to move out.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.129
-  Blake!
Blake, get in here!
- Uh...

09:48.129 --> 09:50.757
- Yeah?
- Someone's been
in our kitchen.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.426
- What?
- Cupboards are empty,
groceries are gone.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.303
Even the gluten-free cookies
are gone.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.930
Like, seriously,
who the fuck eats those?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.349
Randy, obviously.
The fucking moron.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.439
Mm.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.323
You moved
a lot of boxes today.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.699
Yeah, I really did,
didn't I?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.451
- It was crazy.

10:18.451 --> 10:23.331
So, I thought that you
deserved to be rewarded,

10:23.331 --> 10:25.834
- and tonight...
- Oh...

10:25.834 --> 10:29.003
I thought we could do
anything that you wanted.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.216
- Hmm...
- Hm?

10:35.093 --> 10:37.428
You know, this is
a judgment-free zone, right?

10:37.428 --> 10:38.888
Yeah.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.766
Remember the other day
when you were, uh...

10:41.766 --> 10:43.268
talking to me like a dude?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.853
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.771
I kind of, uh...
Something about it

10:46.771 --> 10:48.773
'cause it's...
You're acting like dude,

10:48.773 --> 10:51.192
but it's you,
but it's you doing that voice...

10:51.192 --> 10:54.153
I gotcha.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.741
Fuck me, bro.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.660
- What? Mm-hmm.
- Wha...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.413
What, you hard
of hearing there, chief?
I said fuck me, brah.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.081
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that really works for me.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.798
- Oh, fuck me, bro!
- Oh, my God!

11:22.056 --> 11:23.558
What the fuck?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.810
Um... sorry.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.111
Looks like
he's just doing ayahuasca.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.488
Ayahuasca?
what-what the hell is that?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.782
It's where you, like,
drink a tea from a root,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.952
and you get all sick
and have a spiritual experience.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.496
You'll be all right,
my brother, just let it out.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.498
You're trying to get
all the negativity out.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.085
Let's not let this
get in the way.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.131
- Yeah, bro.
- Yeah, brosef?

11:57.759 --> 12:00.762
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.555
- No. Wait, wait, wait...
- Dude, I can't. Dude!

12:02.555 --> 12:04.933
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll really work. Hold on...

12:06.726 --> 12:09.187
- Come on.
- He's, like, dying out there.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.148
- Well, it's...
part of the experience.
- I can't.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.858
-  Get all
the negative energy out.
- Don't just...

12:13.858 --> 12:15.652
- All the negativity out.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.653
Fuckin' Randy.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.024
Oh, God.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.832
Wake up!

13:10.832 --> 13:13.668
Why...
Why am I being attacked?

13:20.008 --> 13:23.428
Fuck! Oh, shit!

13:23.428 --> 13:25.722
Blake, Blake,
what are you doing in my room?

13:25.722 --> 13:29.809
- What are you doing in my room?
- Relax. Take it in.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.145
- Take it in.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.522
Oh, God.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.232
You gotta be out
by the end of the day.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.276
- Okay? If you need help
paying for a hotel--

13:38.276 --> 13:42.238
Fuck! Or anything, I'll
help you out, but, dude,
you crossed a line.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.282
All right, passing out
in front of our house?

13:44.282 --> 13:46.826
Sarah is pissed,
and I'm with her on this one.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.747
Yeah, well, you tell Sarah
when it comes to tenant's rights
in California...

13:50.747 --> 13:52.874
it's always
pro-motherfuckin' tenant.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.630
Guess what I am, bro?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.673
Huh?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.009
I'm your motherfucking tenant!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.927
Goddammit, you're beautiful.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.520
Fuck! Fuck it,
I gotta get high.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.105
Please.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.690
