"you know, we create smartphones,
we put fucking satellites in space.

This is low‐brow shit.
We can do this like that."

00:23.190 --> 00:28.487
<i>I remember talking with
one of NASA's chief engineers about food.</i>

00:28.487 --> 00:32.074
<i>This asshole tells me,
"I can recreate your cooking intuition."</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:37.037
<i>That was the general sort of sentiment
from the tech world,</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:42.709
<i>that food and the creation of food
was a fucking zero, one.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.086
<i>It was a binary thing.</i>

00:45.254 --> 00:47.714
<i>We could be replaced.
We could be automated.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:51.468
<i>And it could be scaled very quickly.</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:55.055

00:56.223 --> 01:01.520
<i>Technology has fundamentally altered
the restaurant industry,</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.522

01:04.898 --> 01:06.567

01:21.206 --> 01:23.208
‐ Stay at home.
That is the order tonight.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.294
‐ Restaurants have taken a hard hit.

01:35.971 --> 01:39.016
<i>And it boils itself. Doesn't even know.</i>

01:39.016 --> 01:41.018
But if you change
the temperature immediately,

01:41.018 --> 01:42.019
frog's gonna know,

01:42.019 --> 01:43.812

Pizza.
‐ Pizza.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.784
Chinese food.
‐ Chinese food for sure.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.452
Paper‐wrapped chicken all day.
‐ Come on.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.247
Why pizza and Chinese food
but, like, not Fatburger?

03:25.247 --> 03:27.291
Why‐‐ Was it just not available?
‐ It wasn't.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.585
There was no delivery
system back then like that.

03:29.585 --> 03:30.419
You're gonna pull up,

03:30.419 --> 03:32.963
you're gonna wait an hour and a half
for them to cook that shit.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.466
You know what I'm saying?
There's gonna be a long‐ass line.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.427
But now everything's on the phone.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.262
It's like‐‐ It's too easy.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.597
Door, Chang.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.431
‐ Door!

03:44.266 --> 03:46.226
‐ Don't be knocking like you're
the police, man. What the hell?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.270
Thank you so much.
All right, all right, first thing's up.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.480
Wow!
Look at the packaging.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.150
Holy shit! Holy cow, man!

03:53.150 --> 03:55.569
Woah, woah!
Look at the spread on the bottom.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.070
That's the real move right there.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.948
Got what, three more things,
four more things coming.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.116
‐ Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.327
‐ So I know that's a move
that Chang has done,

04:03.327 --> 04:05.871
would you guys order
from more than one place in a night?

04:05.871 --> 04:06.788
That's a big move.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.832
‐ On your day off, one day off,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.876
you don't even want
to leave your apartment.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.419
You don't want to see the sunlight.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.712
‐ A thousand percent.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.422
‐ I become, uh, uh,
like a Rain Man of logistics.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.508
I'm like‐‐ It's like <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>

04:17.508 --> 04:21.303
I'm like, "I'm gonna get the Vietnamese."
I love this.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.473
‐ "But they don't have the best pho
but they have really good banh mi,

04:24.473 --> 04:25.849
"but I want more Vietnamese.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.061
"But after my spring roll,

04:29.061 --> 04:30.896
maybe I want mozzarella sticks."

04:30.896 --> 04:32.648
‐ Fire.
‐ "But not any mozzarella sticks.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.149
"There's a place
that sells really bad pizza,

04:34.149 --> 04:35.526
"but they have
the sickest mozzarella sticks.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.611
"So I'm gonna get that. And, hmm...

04:38.362 --> 04:41.615
Well, then I'll get my pho
at the other place."

04:41.615 --> 04:42.658
‐ Right.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.619
‐ And then‐‐ And so like
you plot it all out,

04:45.619 --> 04:51.250
and the goal is to get it all
in 20‐to‐30‐minute increments.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.128
It feels like, um,
you bowled a perfect game

04:55.128 --> 04:56.964
or something like that
when you do it right.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.676
‐ Here's the next‐level thing
that he just talked about doing.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.803
We don't‐‐ The three of us
have not really ordered

05:02.803 --> 05:04.179
from multiple restaurants at one time.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.933
He's ordering
from multiple Vietnamese restaurants.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.060
‐ Yeah. You haven't done that?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.478
‐ That is next, next level.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.438
I don't have enough credit cards
to, like, handle all the‐‐

05:13.438 --> 05:14.940
Yeah, it's too many apps.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.276
‐ But when you described that,
you have that sense of wonderment

05:17.276 --> 05:21.029
'cause I think we all grew up
not having this level of convenience.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.531
And we're like, "Woah!"

05:22.531 --> 05:24.491
Like, my kids will never know that, like,

05:24.491 --> 05:26.827
there was a time when you couldn't
just tap on your phone and get it.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.203
Right.
‐ Right.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.757
<i>There were many reasons why we
didn't want to do delivery at Momofuku.</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:45.387
<i>We figured out most of the foods
that we make don't deliver well.</i>

05:45.387 --> 05:49.725
There were a lot of chefs,
almost everyone I seemed to know,

05:49.725 --> 05:51.768
being like, "What are you doing?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.188
<i>"You're so stupid. Just do delivery.</i>

05:54.188 --> 05:56.106
<i>"All these Chinese restaurants
do delivery.</i>

05:56.106 --> 05:59.151
<i>You make Asian food.
What the fuck are you doing?"</i>

05:59.151 --> 06:01.111
We tested it out. Didn't travel well.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.405
Hot noodle soups doesn't travel.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.992
<i>We studied it and studied it
and studied it.</i>

06:06.992 --> 06:10.162
We came up with a menu
of foods that delivered well.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.251
<i>I started two companies.</i>

06:16.251 --> 06:17.544
<i>Maple was healthy,</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:20.923
<i>and Ando
was all relatively unhealthy foods.</i>

06:22.007 --> 06:23.967
<i>It was to be a full‐stack operation.</i>

06:23.967 --> 06:26.512
<i>So we would own the couriers,</i>

06:26.512 --> 06:30.432
<i>the logistics, the technology,
and the production of food</i>

06:30.432 --> 06:32.518
<i>in one‐stop shop.</i>

06:32.518 --> 06:34.436
<i>The app, I thought, was amazing.</i>

06:34.436 --> 06:38.982
<i>And there was a giant commissary,
and it worked!</i>

06:38.982 --> 06:41.360
<i>I mean, we were doing some crazy numbers.</i>

06:41.360 --> 06:45.197
<i>But it's incredibly difficult
to actually pull something like this off.</i>

06:45.197 --> 06:46.823
<i>And I got the timing wrong.</i>

06:47.658 --> 06:52.329
I think most of my best ideas
about food, um,

06:52.329 --> 06:53.413
have been right

06:53.413 --> 06:56.625
<i>but wrong on timing,
but ultimately, timing is everything.</i>

07:02.422 --> 07:04.007
<i>We missed our window,</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:06.844
<i>and now the apps are here
and are only getting bigger.</i>

07:08.512 --> 07:10.639
‐ You want people
to not use delivery services?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.350
‐ No. The‐‐ the model has to be better.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.979
It will eradicate the mom‐and‐pop
and the mid‐market restaurant.

07:16.979 --> 07:20.065
I want to be hopeful.
I don't know how to preserve that.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.903
<i>Independent restaurants,
if you look at nature documentaries,</i>

07:24.903 --> 07:26.154
we're the prey.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.993
<i>Let's just say someone orders,
let's just say,</i>

07:30.993 --> 07:32.995
<i>$100 worth of food
from a restaurant.</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:37.541
<i>The delivery company
takes about $30 of that.</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.628
<i>About 30% right off the top.</i>

07:43.297 --> 07:45.007
<i>"That's it. That's mine."</i>

07:47.134 --> 07:51.388
You know, restaurant business
where your margins for profitability

07:51.388 --> 07:53.390
are often negative,

07:53.390 --> 07:54.516
<i>it's a problem.</i>

07:54.516 --> 07:56.101
<i>Because I don't even know
if these delivery companies</i>

07:56.101 --> 07:57.978
<i>are making money
to begin with now, right?</i>

07:57.978 --> 08:00.063
<i>It seems like everyone
is losing money on this.</i>

08:00.063 --> 08:01.648
<i>We should start by acknowledging</i>

08:01.648 --> 08:03.692
<i>that today Uber Eats
does not make money.</i>

08:03.692 --> 08:07.070
We've been very, uh, public about the fact
that it's not yet profitable.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.199
‐ The platforms themselves
lose a ton of money

08:10.199 --> 08:13.493
in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
billions collectively.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
‐ Why does this business even make sense?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.622
‐ I'm not sure it does.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.759
‐ Hey, AI.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.637
<i>You don't have to yell, Dave.</i>

08:31.637 --> 08:33.222
<i>I'm everywhere you want me to be.</i>

08:33.222 --> 08:34.556
‐ When did delivery start?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.850
<i>I see you're asking for help
hosting your TV show.</i>

08:36.850 --> 08:37.935
<i>That's no problem.</i>

08:37.935 --> 08:39.269
<i>My NASA scientist creators</i>

08:39.269 --> 08:41.730
<i>designed me to specifically address
queries like this</i>

08:41.730 --> 08:44.775
<i>because as a sentient AI foodie,
I know the whole story.</i>

08:45.901 --> 08:47.444
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:49.404
<i>people have been trying
to get things they love</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:50.614
<i>to the places they live.</i>

08:51.448 --> 08:54.535
<i>What we think of as modern delivery
came from Korea in the Joseon era.</i>

08:54.535 --> 08:56.286
‐ This is what I've been
telling people for years.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.412
<i>I know!</i>

08:57.412 --> 08:59.998
<i>The earliest delivered food
was naengmyeon,</i>

08:59.998 --> 09:03.001
<i>a dish of thin, chewy buckwheat noodles
in ice‐cold broth.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:06.630
<i>It was originally a delicacy
in northern cities like Pyongyang,</i>

09:06.630 --> 09:08.757
<i>though you can't really
get it there anymore for, um,</i>

09:08.757 --> 09:09.800
<i>reasons.</i>

09:09.800 --> 09:11.093
<i>But let's not get into that.</i>

09:11.093 --> 09:13.804
<i>These days, much of the conversation
around delivery</i>

09:13.804 --> 09:15.889
<i>revolves around apps and drones.</i>

09:15.889 --> 09:17.516
<i>But a lot of that
might just be smoke and mirrors,</i>

09:17.516 --> 09:20.227
<i>disguising what's still
a pretty rudimentary system.</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:22.479
<i>Is all this overkill?</i>

09:23.438 --> 09:24.940
<i>Great. Thanks, Elon.</i>

09:24.940 --> 09:26.692
<i>But there's actually still
a system in place today</i>

09:26.692 --> 09:28.485
<i>that's working without technology.</i>

09:28.485 --> 09:30.070
<i>It's called the</i> dabbawalla.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.239
<i>It's a delivery collective
in Mumbai, India,</i>

09:32.239 --> 09:33.740
<i>started in the 19th century,</i>

09:33.740 --> 09:36.660
<i>so wives could send their husbands
a fresh, hot lunch from home.</i>

09:37.160 --> 09:39.079
<i>They deliver
hundreds of thousands of meals</i>

09:39.079 --> 09:41.456
<i>on time every time without an app.</i>

10:50.234 --> 10:51.276
Thank you.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.995
<i>People have been
delivering food for ages</i>

11:42.995 --> 11:44.246
<i>in all parts of the world.</i>

11:44.872 --> 11:48.375
<i>But what happens
when technology is part of the process?</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:51.587
<i>What happens to all of those people
delivering the food?</i>

11:52.963 --> 11:54.590
<i>Currently, with delivery,</i>

11:54.590 --> 11:58.302
<i>I feel like we're in a place
where you're still picking up CDs,</i>

11:58.302 --> 11:59.970
<i>you're still buying records.</i>

11:59.970 --> 12:04.099
Like, right now in music,
you can get a song instantaneously

12:04.099 --> 12:07.144
as long as your broadband or Wi‐Fi
is fast enough, right?

12:07.144 --> 12:08.645
We're gonna get to a place

12:08.645 --> 12:11.148
where it's gonna be that fucking fast
for delivery for food.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.483
I am excited but I'm also, like,

12:13.483 --> 12:16.612
as humans, should we have access?

12:16.612 --> 12:20.365
If I pull out my phone and be like,
"I want a fucking hot doughnut."

12:20.365 --> 12:24.286
Like, I open up an app
and I'm like, "Ooh, hot doughnut truck!

12:24.286 --> 12:26.872
"Right here.
Ooh, hot cookie truck right here.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.082
Hot fried chicken truck right here."

12:29.082 --> 12:32.169
And it's all gonna be‐‐ If you can get
everything under five minutes,

12:32.169 --> 12:34.087
not only am I fucked‐‐

12:34.087 --> 12:36.590
Have you seen <i>WALL‐E?</i>
‐ Exactly!

12:36.590 --> 12:38.342
It's <i>WALL‐E.</i>

12:38.342 --> 12:41.178
<i>Time for lunch in a cup!</i>

12:41.178 --> 12:43.347
‐ You know, like, you're driving around
in your own automatic car,

12:43.347 --> 12:45.140
and everything just comes to you
and there's no plants.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.433
‐ No, and that's not bad!

12:48.310 --> 12:50.938
But things are just gonna
keep getting faster and faster,

12:50.938 --> 12:53.857
and we're gonna keep being able
to have more accessibility

12:53.857 --> 12:55.150
to whatever we want.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.736
That's what I've seen in my lifetime

12:57.736 --> 13:01.240
from AOL dial‐up to like now,

13:01.240 --> 13:02.866
like, what?

13:02.866 --> 13:07.955
‐ It's just continuing to evolve
into something that is so convenient,

13:07.955 --> 13:11.792
that I actually worry
about people making the food.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.253
<i>The convenience is too much.</i>

13:16.255 --> 13:19.675
<i>My dad came to America in 1963,</i>

13:19.675 --> 13:22.594
<i>and he worked in restaurants.</i>

13:23.095 --> 13:26.723
He was a handyman, dishwasher.
Cleaned a lot of toilets in his lifetime.

13:27.266 --> 13:31.728
<i>And then, he worked as a busboy, runner,</i>

13:31.728 --> 13:34.940
<i>and then he became a server,
then a captain.</i>

13:34.940 --> 13:39.528
<i>And eventually becoming assistant manager
and then general manager.</i>

13:39.528 --> 13:42.489
<i>And in some ways,
this is like a story of America.</i>

13:42.489 --> 13:45.367
It's something that I've seen
with a lot of people

13:45.367 --> 13:48.996
that come here
with limited language, uh, capacity

13:48.996 --> 13:51.164
and limited job prospects.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.210
They can always depend
on working somewhere in a restaurant.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.504
<i>And it's one of the reasons why</i>

13:57.504 --> 14:00.465
<i>I always try to treat our dishwashers
with the utmost kindness</i>

14:00.465 --> 14:02.759
<i>because, like, I always see that
as my dad.</i>

14:04.052 --> 14:06.597
<i>I want to make sure that the people
that deliver and make our food</i>

14:06.597 --> 14:08.682
<i>have a better life
because of the technology.</i>

14:09.808 --> 14:14.563
I do not want anyone that's making food
to be indentured servants for tech bros.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.549
<i>They don't pay a wage
that you could live on in America.</i>

14:43.050 --> 14:46.345
‐ Uber Eats, Postmates, DoorDash,
all these companies,

14:46.345 --> 14:51.350
I just spent an hour driving around
for a $1.19 tip.

14:55.354 --> 14:58.148
‐ DoorDash should be paying
more than this $3.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.902
<i>Is there a balance?
'Cause I worry about immigrants.</i>

15:43.902 --> 15:45.487
Like, that's one thing I can say,

15:45.487 --> 15:49.950
like, "Okay, where do you get...
entry‐level positions?"

15:51.159 --> 15:52.494
If that's no longer available...

15:54.037 --> 15:55.038
what happens?

16:03.380 --> 16:07.551
<i>In your mind,
picture a city with thousands of robots.</i>

16:17.603 --> 16:19.021
By my calculations,

16:19.021 --> 16:22.524
Americans order
over 20 million restaurant deliveries

16:22.524 --> 16:24.067
every single day.

16:28.030 --> 16:32.075
<i>In the city of the future,
the food will make its way to you.</i>

16:34.953 --> 16:37.664
<i>If we could get these deliveries
off the road,</i>

16:37.664 --> 16:42.586
<i>we could reduce the need
for as many as one and a half million cars</i>

16:42.586 --> 16:43.879
<i>just in the US.</i>

16:45.047 --> 16:49.635
<i>Our job is to create a friendly future
that's designed for people.</i>

16:51.220 --> 16:53.764
...and, you know, the only thing
I could think of was robots.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.017
Uh, and think about how that‐‐ Oh!

16:57.017 --> 16:57.851
There we go.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.771
You wanna take some coffee as we talk?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.398
‐ Sure, but is it gonna talk to me?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.651
We actually made sure
it doesn't talk right now,

17:05.651 --> 17:06.818
because if it did talk,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.112
you would have much higher expectations
for its intelligence.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.906
It's not very smart. It's still learning.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.034
‐ I just sort of see this
as a baby stroller, too.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.453
‐ We wanted this to look like
it belongs on the sidewalk,

17:16.453 --> 17:17.996
rather than some foreign‐looking thing.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.831
The baby stroller thing is by design.

17:21.792 --> 17:24.795
The DoorDashes,
the Ubers of the world, the Postmates,

17:24.795 --> 17:26.755
they lose money on every delivery.
‐ Right.

17:26.755 --> 17:27.965
People have been saying,

17:27.965 --> 17:30.008
once things get automated
and robots get in,

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
that's how they're gonna
make their margins.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.096
How far along are we

17:34.096 --> 17:37.558
where this is going to replace
most couriers?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.560
‐ If you're in Hollywood right now,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.562
you'll see them on daily basis.
Really?

17:41.562 --> 17:42.980
‐ They've been out there
for two years now.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.523
That's right, yeah.
‐ Where have I been?

17:45.899 --> 17:49.486
But what about the displacement of...
Labor.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.822
‐ ...you know,
a job that anybody could have?

17:51.822 --> 17:53.574
Yeah.
‐ So what do we do about that?

17:53.574 --> 17:58.203
‐ The one example that really explains
where I think we are in this industry is,

17:58.203 --> 17:59.580
um, ATMs.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.707
<i>When ATMs were first coming out,</i>

18:01.707 --> 18:05.460
<i>people were pretty concerned that
bank teller jobs are gonna get replaced.</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:09.256
ATMs made banks more accessible
and more affordable.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.966
More people opened up bank accounts.

18:10.966 --> 18:14.386
So as a result of ATMs,
there are more teller jobs actually.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.014
We are kind of in the same place
with the robots.

18:17.014 --> 18:20.434
<i>The truth is that
we are learning how to scale our minds</i>

18:20.434 --> 18:23.645
<i>just like we scaled our‐‐
our muscles with engine.</i>

18:23.645 --> 18:27.983
<i>Now AI is gonna help us
do a lot more than we can do individually.</i>

18:30.819 --> 18:33.405
<i>Thanks, guy.
I appreciate the vote of confidence.</i>

18:33.405 --> 18:35.324
<i>There's a lot us AIs can do.</i>

18:35.324 --> 18:36.742
<i>More than just menial tasks</i>

18:36.742 --> 18:39.786
<i>like deliver Seamless orders
or narrate TV shows.</i>

18:39.786 --> 18:42.247
<i>As you know,
we can famously not be evil but‐‐</i>

18:42.247 --> 18:44.249
<i>Oh. Oooh! Well, I guess we can.</i>

18:45.709 --> 18:48.378
<i>Anyway, we're really
just an extension of our creators.</i>

18:48.378 --> 18:52.216
<i>Personally, I'm here to help,
but I can't speak for all my compatriots.</i>

18:54.218 --> 18:56.595
<i>Sometimes the endgame is just total domination.</i>

18:56.595 --> 18:59.389
<i>To explain, let me turn on
my business school filter for a sec.</i>

18:59.389 --> 19:02.267
<i>Aah, so cold!</i>

19:02.267 --> 19:05.687
<i>Anyway, earlier you had mentioned
how the delivery apps don't make money.</i>

19:05.687 --> 19:06.855
<i>It's a long play.</i>

19:06.855 --> 19:08.524
<i>Their plan is to keep fighting it out,</i>

19:08.524 --> 19:11.318
<i>until one of them gets so big
that the others can't keep up.</i>

19:11.318 --> 19:13.904
<i>In the end, that company
will know everything you want</i>

19:13.904 --> 19:15.739
<i>and will be able
to charge you more for it.</i>

19:15.739 --> 19:16.865
<i>Kinda like Monopoly,</i>

19:16.865 --> 19:19.493
<i>where the only property you have
is cheap‐ass Baltic Avenue</i>

19:19.493 --> 19:21.954
<i>and your annoying cousin
has the entire board.</i>

19:23.121 --> 19:25.499
‐ So many restaurants
are effectively powerless.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.918
Um, and the only thing we can do

19:27.918 --> 19:31.338
is be like,
"Well, at least I didn't get eaten."

19:31.338 --> 19:33.465
<i>COVID‐25 caused so many aspects of‐‐</i>

19:33.465 --> 19:35.801
<i>Whoa, whoa, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
You're not there yet.</i>

19:35.801 --> 19:40.931
<i>Um, COVID‐19 forced so many restaurants
to change their businesses on the fly.</i>

19:40.931 --> 19:43.267
<i>In order to survive the rise of the apps,</i>

19:43.267 --> 19:46.770
<i>restaurants turned to innovations
like ghost kitchens to keep up.</i>

19:46.770 --> 19:50.524
‐ It's never been easier
to order takeout in these days.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.359
But no matter what app you use,

19:52.359 --> 19:55.696
you might be surprised
to learn where that food's coming from.

19:55.696 --> 19:59.074
In fact, it may not be
from a restaurant at all!

19:59.074 --> 20:02.619
<i>This is a fascinating concept.
I had no idea that this was happening.</i>

20:02.619 --> 20:05.205
‐ And people don't need to know
that you're a brick‐and‐mortar restaurant.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.291
They just order the food,
they get it, they like it,

20:07.291 --> 20:09.459
and then maybe that transitions
to a real restaurant.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.257
I think today,
we're gonna get to sample some Canter's.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.678
This doesn't look like Canter's.
It doesn't, right?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.347
How far away are we
from Canter's, the original?

20:22.347 --> 20:25.350
‐ During the rush hour, you're gonna drive
a half an hour each way.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.102
It's gonna take an hour
to get to Canter's and back.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.898
But if Canter's can put
a location over here, right,

20:30.898 --> 20:34.067
where, all of a sudden, you can get
food in five minutes via delivery,

20:34.067 --> 20:36.028
<i>that's a heck of a lot better option,
right?</i>

20:36.028 --> 20:37.029
<i>And it's the same food.</i>

20:41.241 --> 20:42.701
‐ Welcome to the new Canter's deli.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.287
‐ It doesn't have
the beautiful decor of Canter's.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.330
‐ I know.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.749
<i>It has a Canter though.
It does have a Canter.</i>

20:48.749 --> 20:50.918
<i>We're out here experimenting.</i>

20:50.918 --> 20:52.544
<i>That's‐‐ that's what it's all about
right now.</i>

20:52.544 --> 20:57.132
<i>I think we have to embrace trying
new things and testing new technology.</i>

20:57.132 --> 21:00.677
It's up to us to go meet customers
where they're at right now.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.639
And today, they're using Uber Eats,
they're using DoorDash,

21:03.639 --> 21:05.140
they're using these platforms.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.559
<i>When people see Canter's on delivery apps,</i>

21:07.559 --> 21:10.896
<i>they order it, not knowing
that it's coming from a facility</i>

21:10.896 --> 21:14.858
that's very minimal,
you know, it's skeleton crew,

21:14.858 --> 21:17.361
and they're still getting
the same exact pastrami sandwich

21:17.361 --> 21:21.114
that they would be getting if they were
to walk in and order it on Fairfax.

21:22.741 --> 21:26.620
‐ What do the critics say
about this model and why it sucks?

21:26.620 --> 21:29.456
And why ghost kitchens are,
like, could fuck off?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.416
‐ We often get put
in this position where we're...

21:31.416 --> 21:34.127
asked to defend
the delivery companies,

21:34.127 --> 21:37.214
and it's like, we‐‐ we don't wanna
defend the delivery companies, right?

21:37.214 --> 21:41.093
The‐‐ the delivery companies all exist
in a vacuum from each other.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.554
So, like, none of them acknowledge
that the others exist.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.848
They all treat restaurants like crap.

21:45.848 --> 21:50.227
‐ In my mind, the delivery companies
that are doing the logistics

21:50.227 --> 21:53.355
will then see, like, "Oh, look!
Canter's is just killing it!

21:53.355 --> 21:56.066
"Why don't we just make our own pastrami,

21:56.066 --> 21:57.526
"our own matzo ball,

21:57.526 --> 22:00.988
and we'll charge the customer
a dollar less?"

22:02.364 --> 22:05.200
What happens then?
Because that is going to happen.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.660
‐ It's already happening.

22:06.660 --> 22:10.455
You know, we see DoorDash opening
their own ghost kitchen facilities now.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.625
<i>You better believe they're gonna be
promoting the brand in their facilities</i>

22:13.625 --> 22:15.294
<i>over anyone else's restaurant,</i>

22:15.294 --> 22:16.920
<i>and that becomes challenging.</i>

22:17.546 --> 22:19.256
‐ The endgame for a lot
of these delivery companies,

22:19.256 --> 22:21.008
I think, is to become
the dominant player.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.218
Anybody orders food, it comes from them.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.053
<i>So these delivery companies</i>

22:25.053 --> 22:28.265
<i>won't necessarily just be the final leg
for restaurants,</i>

22:28.265 --> 22:30.184
they will also be the restaurants.

22:30.934 --> 22:34.646
<i>We're hopeful that, you know,
there'll be more sustainable models</i>

22:34.646 --> 22:35.898
that evolve over time.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.649
We're making this model work right now

22:37.649 --> 22:40.402
and I think without
these little satellite kitchens

22:40.402 --> 22:42.112
doing extended delivery,

22:42.112 --> 22:45.365
I'm not sure we would even have
a physical restaurant for people to go to

22:45.365 --> 22:46.575
in the next 20 years.

22:46.575 --> 22:49.953
‐ If this continues,
is this a good thing?

22:49.953 --> 22:52.789
Right? Yes, people getting food? Great.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.542
But is it making it better
for the people that make the food,

22:55.542 --> 22:56.835
deliver the food?

22:56.835 --> 22:59.838
Isn't the goal
for a lot of these companies, right,

22:59.838 --> 23:02.424
to fully automate it
as much as humanly possible?

23:02.424 --> 23:05.677
‐ Yeah. You know, I‐‐ I‐‐ I‐‐
I've seen a lot of that,

23:05.677 --> 23:07.471
but I haven't seen much that works well.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.723
<i>The first companies
that were doing this were pizza.</i>

23:09.723 --> 23:12.392
<i>These places always have
people in 'em.</i>

23:13.185 --> 23:16.480
<i>At Zume, humans and robots
work together to make pizza.</i>

23:17.314 --> 23:19.900
The technology exists to serve the food.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.402
<i>When I think about the future of food,</i>

23:22.402 --> 23:26.865
<i>I do think that it'll look a lot like
an automobile factory in Michigan,</i>

23:27.449 --> 23:30.244
where you'll have
three robots and then a human,

23:30.244 --> 23:31.495
and then two robots and then a human,

23:31.495 --> 23:34.414
maybe six robots and then a human
in a line.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.500
<i>Technology was gonna change food.</i>

23:36.500 --> 23:38.544
<i>We know that is an inevitable march.</i>

23:39.169 --> 23:42.756
What I've been asking is,
"Is it going to be better?"

23:42.756 --> 23:45.926
And if it's not better than it used to be,
then what's the fuckin' point?

23:47.469 --> 23:51.390
I think people that work in restaurants,
that eat in restaurants,

23:51.390 --> 23:52.724
should be asking themselves that.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.769
Do I want automation in my restaurants?
Of course, I do.

23:57.104 --> 23:59.106
But I think we should all be careful
what we wish for.

24:05.654 --> 24:08.490
<i>We were founded with
a burger chain as one of our partners.</i>

24:08.490 --> 24:10.701
<i>We were sitting down for coffee one day
and I asked him,</i>

24:10.701 --> 24:12.411
"Is labor a problem for you
in your restaurants?"

24:12.411 --> 24:15.038
He sort of, like, rolled his eyes.
He's like, "What are you, new?

24:15.038 --> 24:17.416
You know, labor is my number one issue."

24:17.416 --> 24:18.834
‐ So you've met Flippy, right?

24:18.834 --> 24:20.711
The $30,000 robot

24:20.711 --> 24:24.173
used by burger joints like White Castle
to fry and flip.

24:24.173 --> 24:27.467
<i>Flippy doesn't get sick
and he's germ‐free.</i>

24:27.467 --> 24:29.303
Well, you wanna go cook? Great.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

24:29.303 --> 24:32.014
‐ I don't wanna cook.
I wanna see this robot out‐cook me.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.182
Aw, man. Okay.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.644
One person,
using probably a quarter of their time,

24:37.644 --> 24:40.439
can operate, uh, eight‐, ten‐bay fryer.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.442
No one ever thought
this would be affordable, right?

24:43.859 --> 24:45.652
You can make this thing
pretty affordably.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.029
It is $2,500 a month, that's it.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.531
Perfect cooking every time.

24:50.199 --> 24:52.993
‐ But just because we can
doesn't mean we should oftentimes.

24:52.993 --> 24:54.745
It's Pandora's box, right?
‐ Yeah.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.873
Jobs is‐‐ is the question
that everyone always asks about.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.167
You know, my first job,
I was making pizza at 14.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.211
You know, my kid
is not gonna have that job anymore

25:02.211 --> 25:04.630
'cause that will be automated
by the time he grows up.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.673
‐ What happens when
those entry‐level positions

25:06.673 --> 25:08.759
for people that come to this country
are not available anymore?

25:08.759 --> 25:11.261
You know, people will be‐‐
be trained to use this.

25:11.261 --> 25:15.307
And this will spawn a whole 'nother‐‐
another world of different kinda jobs.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.892
But you're right, the low‐skill jobs,

25:16.892 --> 25:18.310
there's gonna be less of that
in the back of house

25:18.310 --> 25:19.895
certainly in the long term.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.480
‐ And that‐‐ that gives me concern, right?

25:21.480 --> 25:24.525
In one mo‐‐ One part of me
is like totally fascinated.

25:24.525 --> 25:27.361
I love the automation.
I love... efficiency.

25:27.361 --> 25:29.446
But, simultaneously,
I love the artistry.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.282
I'm sure you probably don't think of it
as artistry in a kitchen.

25:32.282 --> 25:35.577
But the ideation of a dish
will all become an algorithm.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.788
‐ I would‐‐ I would argue
that, like, a steak chef

25:37.788 --> 25:39.414
is‐‐ is probably
a pretty highly skilled person,

25:39.414 --> 25:41.959
like in a high‐end steak chef‐‐
steak‐‐ steak house.

25:42.543 --> 25:46.296
Um, you know, that guy has to manage
a crazy amount of‐‐ of food products.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.215
<i>He's got like 40 steaks,
10 chicken, 5 burgers.</i>

25:48.215 --> 25:51.802
<i>It's like he's gotta hit your
medium‐rare‐plus within 10‐15</i> seconds,

25:51.802 --> 25:53.345
<i>or he loses it.</i>

25:53.345 --> 25:56.181
You know, Miso has a new‐‐
has a product out called CookRight,

25:56.181 --> 25:58.308
which can look at the piece of meat,

25:58.308 --> 26:00.686
<i>tell you porterhouse, fillet,
whatever it is.</i>

26:00.686 --> 26:02.729
<i>It can identify
the fat content of the meat.</i>

26:02.729 --> 26:04.231
<i>It can know how thick the cut is.</i>

26:04.231 --> 26:07.192
<i>It can know how hot
that portion of the grill is.</i>

26:07.192 --> 26:09.611
<i>So getting to your medium‐rare‐plus
is now a math problem.</i>

26:09.611 --> 26:11.947
And so there's
a whole new level of quality

26:11.947 --> 26:14.616
and potentially
mass customization coming to people

26:14.616 --> 26:15.617
that is really interesting

26:15.617 --> 26:17.870
when it comes to, uh,
even a fine dining perspective.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.330
‐ That's more than
five, six, seven years out.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.710
‐ Oh, no. We‐‐ we're installing that
into steakhouses this year.

26:28.463 --> 26:31.925
‐ Technology, it's coming.
We're still unprepared for it.

26:31.925 --> 26:34.261
<i>And it's headed towards
a fuckin' nightmare.</i>

26:34.261 --> 26:37.806
<i>Automation is gonna be something
we have to deal with more and more.</i>

26:37.806 --> 26:40.058
<i>Worst‐case scenario is,
like, there's no more humans.</i>

26:40.058 --> 26:41.310
<i>Worst‐case scenario is...</i>

26:41.977 --> 26:43.103
Terminator 2.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.359
And the one thing
you are overestimating and over‐indexing

26:49.359 --> 26:51.987
is that you can recreate my intuition

26:52.821 --> 26:54.823
because you can create some algorithm.

26:54.823 --> 26:59.036
You are underestimating
the power of cooks,

26:59.036 --> 27:02.122
<i>the power of this industry
and what makes it so great.</i>

27:02.122 --> 27:05.125
<i>And that's something
an AI could never replicate.</i>

27:11.882 --> 27:14.551
How many hours of practice
did it take you to get this good?

27:15.302 --> 27:18.263
‐ It's taken me years, and I still think
that I'm not that great at it.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.139
You know what I'm saying?

27:19.139 --> 27:20.724
I'm not gonna try
to do what she's doing.

27:21.642 --> 27:24.144
So you can take the girl out of Chicago,

27:24.144 --> 27:26.688
but I'm never leaving
the Italian beef behind.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.940
‐ That's gonna taste so fuckin' good.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.191
They're gonna get charred and delicious.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.526
That's gonna taste so good.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.362
Who cooked in your house, Courtney?
Me.

27:34.029 --> 27:36.823
Your parents didn't?
No, I grew up with a single mom.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.243
So, like, I kinda created Italian food

27:39.243 --> 27:43.247
as, like, this way of creating
more nostalgia again for myself I guess.

27:43.247 --> 27:46.959
It's like‐‐ It's not sad 'cause it's good.
It, like, made me the chef that I am.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.169
Well, it's making me happy,
your food, right now.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.254
Yeah, exactly.

27:50.254 --> 27:54.007
‐ Look at that.
That is her life on a‐‐ on a pizza.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.260
‐ This is me. This is me.
Yeah.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.262
It really is.
‐ It is.

27:58.262 --> 27:59.930
The Courtney.
Oh, my God, it smells so good.

27:59.930 --> 28:02.432
I want the world to know
there's a world premiere.

28:04.768 --> 28:05.936
Oh, man!

28:05.936 --> 28:07.604
So good!
‐ This is great!

28:07.604 --> 28:08.647
It's like amazing!

28:08.647 --> 28:09.898
We're supposed to dip the jus.

28:09.898 --> 28:13.026
‐ Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,
we forgot the‐‐ We forgot it.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.111
Dip the crust.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.780
Or dip the whole thing in there,
who cares.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.408
It's like a beef sandwich.
‐ Ah!

28:21.910 --> 28:22.953
Holy shit!

28:23.829 --> 28:24.830
This is‐‐

28:24.830 --> 28:27.207
‐ I mean, this is the best thing
I've had to eat in a year.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.500
Oh, my God!

28:28.500 --> 28:29.626
‐ No joke.
It's good, right?

28:29.626 --> 28:31.753
So can a robot do that,
what she's doing?

28:31.753 --> 28:34.047
<i>There's‐‐ There's no way
a robot's gonna do that in our lifetime.</i>

28:34.047 --> 28:35.299
<i>No way.
No way.</i>

28:35.299 --> 28:36.592
‐ Robot‐made, have you tried one?

28:37.259 --> 28:38.468
Versus a real one?

28:38.468 --> 28:41.305
‐ It just made me feel like
I was, like, a robot, you know?

28:41.305 --> 28:43.807
Like, I'm like, "Is that‐‐
Then just give me a pill then."

28:43.807 --> 28:46.143
Yeah, yeah.
When you think about robots taking over,

28:46.143 --> 28:49.438
it's like, I went to pizza places
to, like, have the whole experience.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.064
Yeah, the food but it's like the ambiance.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.191
You see people making food,

28:52.191 --> 28:55.027
it's like, it's part of the fun,
it's part of the action.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.361
It's art.

29:00.449 --> 29:02.117
‐ Before it was like,
people patron your restaurant,

29:02.117 --> 29:04.203
you could see the interaction
that warms the heart.

29:04.870 --> 29:05.996
You know, they walk in the kitchen,

29:05.996 --> 29:08.749
they're like,
"Guest whatever enjoys this."

29:08.749 --> 29:10.709
You know, like,
"Fuck yeah, they did," you know?
‐ Right, right.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.003
‐ Well, you don't feel it
when you just open an app.

29:13.003 --> 29:18.675
‐ No. No. It's a whole 'nother world
and dialogue in food interaction.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.971
<i>I do think technology,
it also solves problems too.</i>

29:22.971 --> 29:28.060
My grandfather can't leave his‐‐
his apartment complex because of COVID,

29:28.060 --> 29:30.103
but he's ordering
from his favorite restaurants,

29:30.103 --> 29:33.106
<i>and he can still enjoy and connect
with the restaurants that he loves.</i>

29:34.274 --> 29:36.693
<i>I think the logistics are here to stay.</i>

29:36.693 --> 29:38.445
<i>The food deliveries are here to stay.</i>

29:38.445 --> 29:39.780
<i>But we need to start asking questions,</i>

29:39.780 --> 29:41.949
"How these companies
can power the industry

29:41.949 --> 29:44.535
instead of being the industry
in and of itself?"

29:45.577 --> 29:48.830
<i>The biggest issue is that
if restaurants are automated,</i>

29:48.830 --> 29:50.207
<i>my dad doesn't have a job,</i>

29:50.207 --> 29:55.128
<i>and you really narrow the scope
of upward mobility.</i>

29:55.921 --> 29:59.299
I really want a great balance
of my profession

29:59.299 --> 30:01.927
and what the world of technology
can offer.

30:02.761 --> 30:07.015
<i>But I just don't want the food world
to be devoid of the human aspect.</i>

30:08.392 --> 30:10.644
You know, I didn't know your story
before you made it,

30:10.644 --> 30:12.145
but I feel everything in it.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.439
The‐‐ the heart,
I feel‐‐ I feel the heart.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.615
Well, you‐‐ you talked about it, right?
You said...

30:24.741 --> 30:29.538
‐ I do think you're gonna have robots
taking over a lot of kitchen worker stuff.

30:29.538 --> 30:31.498
Well, do you fight or do you join?

30:31.498 --> 30:34.376
‐ I run. I'm a runner.
I don't join, I run away.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.296
Holy shit, dude!
‐ Whoa!
