00:01.201 --> 00:03.348
<i>After a weekend with Sam,
it's always sad</i>

00:03.468 --> 00:06.143
<i>driving him the 37 minutes
back to Kim's house</i>

00:06.454 --> 00:08.454
<i>Still, there was one positive.</i>

00:09.052 --> 00:10.696
<i>Elliot's a bit territorial.</i>

00:10.816 --> 00:13.193
<i>So if I got any physical
contact from Kim...</i>

00:13.313 --> 00:14.997
Your collar is messed up.

00:17.022 --> 00:19.795
<i>On the way home, Elliot
made me pull over for car sex.</i>

00:22.884 --> 00:24.872
<i>I know I shouldn't
exploit her insecurities.</i>

00:24.992 --> 00:28.209
<i>But car sex really appeals
to my exhibitionist side.</i>

00:33.482 --> 00:34.734
Here we are.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.393
That bitch better watch her hands.

00:38.080 --> 00:38.939
Hi, Kim.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.913
JD, you have fuzz in your hair.

00:44.404 --> 00:46.391
<i>I know. I put it there.</i>

00:46.784 --> 00:48.367
I need to tell you guys something.

00:49.284 --> 00:51.101
<i>It didn't matter
what Kim had to say.</i>

00:51.221 --> 00:53.806
<i>Elliot was already in car sex mode.</i>

00:53.926 --> 00:56.604
To save time, I'll just
take off my underwear here.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.973
Whatever is good for you.

00:58.317 --> 01:00.415
<i>Nothing could stop this train.</i>

01:03.812 --> 01:07.346
<i>You know. Unless Kim was
dating Elliot's stupid ex-boyfriend.</i>

01:14.146 --> 01:15.201
You know what sucks?

01:15.321 --> 01:17.619
I have to hire
a new Chief or Surgery.

01:17.739 --> 01:20.700
And I just can't fathom giving any
of you tiny-brained scalpel jockeys

01:20.820 --> 01:22.367
a leadership position.

01:22.487 --> 01:23.797
Honestly, so far,

01:23.917 --> 01:27.036
this is the only candidate
who I'm seriously considering.

01:27.278 --> 01:29.229
The guy has the opposable thumbs

01:29.349 --> 01:31.573
so you automatically know
he can handle the job.

01:31.693 --> 01:34.137
And I was just thinking
if you slap a diaper on him

01:34.257 --> 01:36.255
and maybe tape
some glasses to his face,

01:36.375 --> 01:38.377
sure as shooting
he'll look professional enough.

01:38.497 --> 01:41.187
Do you know what?
I'm gonna call the gentleman.

01:44.260 --> 01:46.592
- I'd be great at that job.
- Then go for it.

01:46.712 --> 01:47.892
Chief of Surgery?

01:48.012 --> 01:51.003
Baby, one of the most
amazing things about you

01:51.123 --> 01:53.104
is that when you want
something badly enough,

01:53.224 --> 01:55.015
you always make it happen.

01:55.135 --> 01:57.081
Remember when you
first started working here.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.828
And I had no interest
in dating you, what did you do?

01:59.948 --> 02:01.027
I made it happen.

02:01.147 --> 02:03.628
And what about when
I had no interest in marrying you?

02:03.748 --> 02:04.978
I made it happen!

02:05.098 --> 02:07.174
Go make this happen.

02:07.432 --> 02:08.622
I'm doing it.

02:11.304 --> 02:13.304
Even though
you didn't use to like me,

02:13.424 --> 02:15.987
- I'm your world now, right?
- My whole word.

02:16.944 --> 02:18.785
That's what I'm talking about.

02:21.668 --> 02:22.622
No, thanks.

02:23.027 --> 02:24.205
So how's married life?

02:24.325 --> 02:25.972
You have to make compromises.

02:26.217 --> 02:29.432
Like my wife's allergic to raccoons.
So I had to throw out my comforter.

02:29.947 --> 02:31.321
How was your honeymoon?

02:31.588 --> 02:33.748
Did you know that Kelso
stayed in the Bahamas too?

02:35.686 --> 02:36.815
I love you.

02:37.278 --> 02:38.738
I love you too.

02:43.299 --> 02:44.719
Let's never leave.

02:47.455 --> 02:48.658
Yeah, we saw him.

02:48.879 --> 02:50.275
Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:50.395 --> 02:54.299
I was so blitzed with rum drinks
I could barely remember where I was.

02:54.419 --> 02:55.444
I feel horrible.

02:55.564 --> 02:58.430
Oh no, stop it. At first, you were
like the third wheel from hell,

02:58.550 --> 02:59.911
but then we made you do stuff.

03:00.031 --> 03:02.554
Made you pay for our meals.
Got you in a couple bar fights.

03:02.811 --> 03:05.339
On the beach, we bet you
you couldn't eat a starfish.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.115
- And?
- I owe you a buck.

03:07.544 --> 03:09.188
- So you had fun with it?
- Oh yeah.

03:09.446 --> 03:10.243
Good.

03:10.363 --> 03:12.475
Folks, I'm sorry
but we have to close.

03:12.595 --> 03:15.152
Our pastry maker was
just admitted to the hospital

03:15.272 --> 03:17.739
with a highly
contagious intestinal virus.

03:21.197 --> 03:23.418
What the hell. I'm already in it.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.639
I need to check myself in.

03:27.759 --> 03:28.716
For what?

03:34.161 --> 03:35.192
For that.

03:38.529 --> 03:40.456
So we've been dating about a month

03:40.576 --> 03:43.865
and I just didn't want to say anything
until I knew it was gonna go somewhere.

03:43.985 --> 03:45.487
Well, we hit a little speed bump

03:45.607 --> 03:47.645
when I first found out
that Sam was your baby.

03:47.765 --> 03:50.957
Yeah, he got drunk and asked me
to sell him on the black market.

03:51.077 --> 03:53.239
- She wouldn't, but...
- Oh that's sweet.

03:53.878 --> 03:57.498
I just don't understand how you two
even met. Did someone introduce you?

04:01.596 --> 04:02.897
I love you.

04:03.225 --> 04:06.084
Sweetie, it was over a year ago.
You and I weren't even together.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.775
I figured at most
they could end up friends.

04:08.895 --> 04:11.248
Well, you also told me
he was great in the sack.

04:11.368 --> 04:12.831
Kim, I will kill you.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.889
He's not, sweetie.

04:17.009 --> 04:17.964
[mouthing]
You are.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.413 --> 04:30.774
S08E16:
My Cuz

04:32.762 --> 04:34.075
See you then.

04:34.319 --> 04:36.319
They're coming by for lunch
so we can hear everything out

04:36.439 --> 04:39.080
- and get past all this weirdness.
- Sean's coming here?

04:39.200 --> 04:40.855
You don't realize how much
it sucks to spend time

04:40.975 --> 04:42.633
with someone you used to sleep with.

04:42.854 --> 04:45.332
You used to sleep with Kim,
and I have to see her every week.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.185
- That's totally different.
- How?

04:47.305 --> 04:49.536
I don't know. I'm not
some genius that knows

04:49.656 --> 04:52.001
why things that seem the same
are actually very different.

04:52.121 --> 04:53.277
Be crazier.

04:55.179 --> 04:57.486
Did you put on that
Cologne I hate to punish me?

04:58.072 --> 04:59.299
That's insane.

04:59.419 --> 05:00.832
<i>Insanely true.</i>

05:02.305 --> 05:03.087
Go.

05:03.848 --> 05:07.025
Now, I know
I gave all of you 5-1 odds,

05:07.145 --> 05:10.265
but no one stitches
an orange faster than me.

05:10.486 --> 05:11.357
No one.

05:11.599 --> 05:14.213
I am a... god.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.311
- Done.
- Damn it!

05:16.602 --> 05:19.499
Good. This is where
you interns are located.

05:19.619 --> 05:22.148
Here I was worried you were
out taking care of sick people.

05:22.944 --> 05:24.475
Finished. Oh crap.

05:24.595 --> 05:25.505
Leave.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.027
I'll take that.

05:27.248 --> 05:29.257
- I heard you were looking for me.
- Yes.

05:29.564 --> 05:32.288
I want officially put my name
in for the Chief of Surgery.

05:33.711 --> 05:35.036
That's a good one.

05:35.306 --> 05:37.698
Laugh all you want
but I'm still getting that job.

05:37.818 --> 05:39.944
I know we don't always get along personally.

05:40.064 --> 05:42.546
But in my defense, it's
because you're a huge jackass.

05:43.073 --> 05:45.622
I'm the best cutter in
this place. And you know it.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.807
When you put it
that way, you compel me

05:47.927 --> 05:50.125
to consult with
a decision committee.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.562
Say, Perry?

05:52.682 --> 05:53.578
Yes, Perry.

05:53.698 --> 05:54.910
Listen, I was wondering.

05:55.030 --> 05:58.462
Can Dr. Turk here
be the new Chief of Surgery?

05:58.582 --> 05:59.339
Well,

05:59.459 --> 06:02.063
I haven't hit the bottle yet
today, so I'm not that drunk.

06:02.183 --> 06:04.868
The answer is no.
Not in this lifetime.

06:05.206 --> 06:07.402
Sorry there.
I did everything possible.

06:07.819 --> 06:08.663
Strength.

06:12.798 --> 06:15.153
- How are you feeling?
- Not great.

06:15.273 --> 06:17.848
But now, when I hurl,
I've been trying to say the names

06:17.968 --> 06:19.963
of my favorite novels so that's fun.

06:20.899 --> 06:21.662
Look.

06:21.782 --> 06:25.463
I'm sure I just have an enterovirus,
so order me 40 cc of...

06:25.583 --> 06:27.942
No, you are not a doctor here anymore.

06:28.062 --> 06:30.648
You will not treat yourself.
I'm sticking the interns on you.

06:30.768 --> 06:32.022
Come on!

06:34.183 --> 06:36.036
What happened
to your sleeve there, Tex?

06:36.156 --> 06:38.158
I sewed on orange on to it.

06:38.471 --> 06:39.977
I'll take the foreigner.

06:41.957 --> 06:43.184
I'm so happy!

06:48.697 --> 06:50.981
I dropped Sam off
at the daycare upstairs

06:51.101 --> 06:53.250
and they seemed really
good with him, didn't they?

06:53.370 --> 06:55.630
- There were good. It was good.
- Oh, good good.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.455
Good things are good.
So it's good.

06:57.575 --> 06:59.725
Stop saying "good", Sean.
You sound like an ass.

06:59.845 --> 07:01.434
You said it too. He said "good".

07:01.554 --> 07:03.840
No I didn't, Sean.
Can you believe this guy?

07:03.960 --> 07:05.607
I need to talk to Kim.
Let's divide up.

07:05.727 --> 07:06.622
I vote yes.

07:07.491 --> 07:10.055
- You said "good".
- Nobody cares, Sean.

07:10.982 --> 07:12.341
Nobody cares.

07:18.213 --> 07:21.501
Am I gonna have an office this fancy
when I'm the Chief of Surgery?

07:21.621 --> 07:25.108
It's dangerous to try
to reason with delusional people

07:25.228 --> 07:27.571
so I'm just gonna
go about my business.

07:27.903 --> 07:30.872
Okay, I'll go. But only because
it's time for my peer recommendation.

07:31.473 --> 07:32.660
Right here, buddy.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.531
I get embarrassed when
people say nice things about me.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.482
Handle your business.

07:38.461 --> 07:41.786
Dr. Turk should be chief because he's
skilled technically, super-efficient.

07:41.906 --> 07:44.694
He's got an awesome dong. He's
great with laparoscopic procedures.

07:44.814 --> 07:46.351
Patients love him...

07:46.641 --> 07:48.678
What was that middle one?

07:49.190 --> 07:50.205
Laparoscopic?

07:50.325 --> 07:52.831
So, you are the best
he could muster up?

07:53.273 --> 07:56.058
No, I'm not the only one.
We all want Turk.

08:07.368 --> 08:09.957
<i>You</i> want him
to be the Chief of Surgery?

08:10.178 --> 08:11.086
That depends.

08:11.206 --> 08:13.786
Does he get a special
chief hat, like a Police Chief?

08:15.089 --> 08:17.189
If you give him the job,
and I make him a hat,

08:17.309 --> 08:18.882
will you force him to wear it?

08:19.336 --> 08:22.097
I was thinking like
an old-time scuba diver helmet.

08:22.706 --> 08:23.651
Hello.

08:24.031 --> 08:25.353
You need a new colon.

08:28.381 --> 08:29.510
Is that a maybe?

08:32.073 --> 08:33.496
You're ready to do this?

08:33.755 --> 08:35.399
Let's hear some crap out.

08:37.852 --> 08:40.082
I feel guilty because
we used to be friends

08:40.203 --> 08:42.832
and now I resent you so much
for having a baby with JD

08:42.953 --> 08:45.433
that sometimes
I dream about you dying.

08:46.862 --> 08:50.077
Also, if you ever even touch JD,
I have sex with him in the car

08:50.197 --> 08:52.923
in front of a random creepy
bicyclist that JD thinks I don't see.

08:53.043 --> 08:55.095
- That sounds healthy.
- I think it is.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.482
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

08:58.156 --> 09:00.512
I used to dream
about you dying all the time.

09:00.779 --> 09:02.987
- Really?
- Yeah. Seriously.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.265
- What are the women talking about?
- I'm not psychic, Sean.

09:06.563 --> 09:08.011
But they better not be all chummy

09:08.131 --> 09:10.293
chatting about which
one of us is better in bed.

09:10.413 --> 09:12.499
They're women.
They don't talk about that.

09:12.839 --> 09:15.134
JD's better at sex.
Sean's better at foreplay.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.257
JD's great at foreplay. He just
takes the "play" part literally

09:18.377 --> 09:20.878
so you've got to embrace
all of his games, you know, his...

09:22.031 --> 09:24.227
"Nooks and Crannies",
"Upsy Daisies".

09:24.347 --> 09:27.417
"Who's in There?", followed
after by "What's in There?"

09:27.687 --> 09:30.313
- "Mr. Peep Tries on Hats".
- Love that one.

09:31.044 --> 09:33.154
It's not fair that we still
have to be in each other's lives.

09:33.274 --> 09:34.084
I know.

09:34.204 --> 09:37.065
But I also know the girls aren't
gonna let up until we make peace.

09:37.659 --> 09:40.395
So what do you say
we change the tone a little bit

09:40.515 --> 09:42.720
and both say something
nice about each other?

09:43.423 --> 09:44.772
I'll go first.

09:46.021 --> 09:47.064
Look at you.

09:47.506 --> 09:48.975
There's no way around it.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.669
You're a beautiful man.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.549
- Thank you, JD.
- Now you go.

09:53.929 --> 09:56.702
- I never agreed to that.
- Beautiful son of a bitch.

09:57.009 --> 09:59.598
We need to stop seeing
each other as enemies.

09:59.989 --> 10:02.038
Sean, you and I have
had sex with the same women.

10:02.271 --> 10:05.117
Therefore, we're wiener cousins.

10:05.621 --> 10:07.854
And where I come from,
this right here...

10:08.600 --> 10:10.047
Stronger than family.

10:10.462 --> 10:12.805
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it ridiculous, fellas?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.241
Nurse Roberts.

10:16.361 --> 10:19.085
Both of them. One night.
May she rest in peace.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.011
Cuz?

10:24.824 --> 10:26.358
I'm not hooking fingers.

10:28.272 --> 10:29.511
It won't be official.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.201
We touched, it counts.

10:34.809 --> 10:36.784
I'm just putting an IV in, okay?

10:38.207 --> 10:39.014
Sir?

10:40.928 --> 10:41.689
Sir?

10:41.983 --> 10:43.014
Are you okay?

10:45.796 --> 10:47.244
One-nothing, Bobbo.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.790
Good one.

10:49.047 --> 10:50.152
Hold still.

10:51.342 --> 10:52.627
Damn it, we're even.

10:53.094 --> 10:54.897
That wasn't a vein, was it?

10:55.017 --> 10:58.554
That's okay, sweetheart.
You're probably just nervous.

10:58.819 --> 11:02.353
So why don't you go get a cup of
water to relax and we'll try it again.

11:02.905 --> 11:05.064
Thanks. I'll be right back.

11:05.494 --> 11:06.770
Take your time.

11:17.099 --> 11:18.277
The Grapes of...

11:18.535 --> 11:19.713
The Grapes of...

11:20.117 --> 11:21.995
Wrath!

11:26.448 --> 11:29.025
I'm so proud of you for
working things out with Sean.

11:29.319 --> 11:31.883
What can I say?
He's my wiener cuz.

11:32.003 --> 11:33.500
Kim and I are bajingo sisters.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.672
- You always wanted one of those.
- I know!

11:36.445 --> 11:37.586
There's Sammy.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.344
It's okay. It's okay.

11:43.774 --> 11:46.511
<i>As a parent, you realize there
are things much more annoying</i>

11:46.631 --> 11:48.510
<i>than your child crying in your ear.</i>

11:49.246 --> 11:51.172
<i>Someday, he'll lie to your face.</i>

11:51.856 --> 11:53.034
Who placed that IV?

11:53.276 --> 11:54.626
Another intern did it.

11:56.025 --> 11:58.736
<i>Or he'll relentlessly
pester you for a toy he wants.</i>

11:58.856 --> 12:00.858
You're gonna give me
that job or what?

12:05.662 --> 12:06.812
He's a little sad.

12:07.907 --> 12:08.988
Can you take him?

12:09.108 --> 12:10.974
He never cries when Sean holds him.

12:11.611 --> 12:14.151
<i>Still, nothing really matters
as long as you know in your heart</i>

12:14.271 --> 12:16.051
<i>that your child loves you the most.</i>

12:17.612 --> 12:19.219
Better, little man.

12:20.078 --> 12:21.097
Bye, guys.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.488
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

12:32.721 --> 12:35.003
So Sam stopped crying the
second Sean picked him up, huh?

12:35.123 --> 12:37.052
- It's harsh.
- I know.

12:37.172 --> 12:38.741
JD was a little quiet last night.

12:38.861 --> 12:40.948
But I'm proud of him,
he's really handling it well.

12:44.318 --> 12:46.296
Your plan to sex up my old girlfriend

12:46.416 --> 12:48.808
so you can turn my
baby boy against me is over.

12:49.066 --> 12:50.330
Hey, buddy.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.732
No, what's wrong?
What's wrong? It's okay.

12:54.852 --> 12:57.573
How are you doing this?
Are you a sorcerer?

13:01.661 --> 13:04.753
I heard you were hiring Dr. Turk
as the new Chief of Surgery.

13:06.041 --> 13:09.486
- Told her the good news.
- It's not happening.

13:09.606 --> 13:13.167
I have tried to communicate that message
to you every single way I know how

13:13.287 --> 13:14.774
but you won't hear it.

13:14.894 --> 13:18.360
Honestly, the only option I have
left is to concentrate really hard

13:18.480 --> 13:23.026
and see if I can shoot my actual
message right into your big bald head.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.116
I know you don't want
to give me the job.

13:27.236 --> 13:28.294
My god.

13:28.414 --> 13:31.092
It worked. This is
a terrific day for science.

13:31.212 --> 13:32.754
Time to call in the closer.

13:33.810 --> 13:34.963
A word.

13:35.586 --> 13:37.795
Why do you always have your
wife fight your battles for you?

13:38.224 --> 13:39.018
I do.

13:39.767 --> 13:40.920
Get him, woman.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.819
- What are you doing?
- I'm doctoring my file.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.824
- What are you doing?
- I'm making this special hat

13:51.944 --> 13:54.031
in case Black Doctor
gets the Chief of Surgery job.

13:55.332 --> 13:58.154
I need you to guard this door
while I take care of some business.

13:58.274 --> 13:59.265
Why should I?

13:59.495 --> 14:00.621
You know why.

14:01.201 --> 14:04.232
The bond that can't be broken.
That was 20 years ago, but...

14:05.414 --> 14:06.727
I'll honor the code.

14:11.705 --> 14:14.478
You seemed so happy in the
Bahamas. How come you left?

14:16.372 --> 14:18.777
I thought it was a nude beach.

14:19.072 --> 14:21.452
- It was a church, Bob.
- So?

14:24.310 --> 14:25.267
Fine.

14:25.623 --> 14:26.702
I'll go.

14:28.809 --> 14:30.281
Hey, stop him!

14:33.239 --> 14:34.772
It was time to go.

14:39.555 --> 14:40.647
Oh, good.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.583
Someone already gave him the shot.

14:43.135 --> 14:45.442
Can I have that? I want to
put it on something I'm making.

14:45.562 --> 14:47.773
- I don't think that's okay.
- It's a hat.

14:48.809 --> 14:50.171
I'm gonna hang on to this.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.134
See, he's fine now.
But when I get close.

14:58.809 --> 15:00.404
Doesn't make any sense.

15:01.137 --> 15:05.346
Unless of course someone is shocking
him by pressing a remote control button.

15:05.603 --> 15:07.885
- What's that in your hand, Sean?
- Yogurt.

15:08.005 --> 15:09.528
What's at the bottom of it?

15:09.648 --> 15:11.723
- Peach. Peaches.
- Give me that.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.755
You're clean.

15:17.504 --> 15:20.105
- See what he did to my last yogurt?
- I know. Calm down.

15:20.731 --> 15:22.522
And he said "good"
yesterday, I heard him.

15:22.642 --> 15:24.571
You know what?
Give us a minute to talk. Come on.

15:27.179 --> 15:28.737
What the hell are you doing?

15:30.329 --> 15:31.348
I don't know.

15:32.059 --> 15:34.145
Look, after my parents divorced,

15:34.265 --> 15:36.170
my dad really wasn't around for me.

15:37.033 --> 15:40.993
And I promised myself I was gonna
be a better father than he was.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.923
Now, Sam cries like
I'm some kind of stranger.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.438
And I like that Sean has
a relationship with him, I do.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.600
- Thanks, man.
- I'm not talking to you, Sean.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.827
You are a great dad.

15:57.474 --> 15:59.152
Then why can't I hold him?

16:02.808 --> 16:03.864
Hi, guys.

16:03.984 --> 16:06.428
If you don't stop treating yourself,
I'm gonna have you strapped down.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.530
Naughty.

16:07.650 --> 16:08.665
And you...

16:09.033 --> 16:12.408
Just give Turk the job already.
He's a natural leader.

16:12.528 --> 16:16.187
Plus I'm about to spit out a second
kid, I could use the extra cash.

16:16.307 --> 16:18.883
I knew damn sure you were gonna
go ahead and make this personal.

16:19.003 --> 16:20.894
Am I supposed to give him a job

16:21.014 --> 16:23.037
because you and I
are such good friends?

16:23.157 --> 16:25.650
I wouldn't ask you if
I didn't know he was right for it.

16:25.770 --> 16:28.553
Bob, who's the best all-around
surgeon in this place?

16:28.673 --> 16:30.025
Turkleton, hands down.

16:30.145 --> 16:31.393
Kiss more butt, Bob.

16:31.513 --> 16:34.927
And you're giving me lip
for making this personal?

16:35.047 --> 16:37.737
The only reason you're
not giving Turk this job

16:37.857 --> 16:40.072
is because of your
personal feelings for him.

16:40.735 --> 16:42.502
- That's just not true.
- Liar.

16:43.701 --> 16:45.456
The Adventures of Huckleberry...

16:45.824 --> 16:47.449
The Adventures of Huckleberry...

16:47.720 --> 16:49.207
Don't puke on me, Bob.

16:50.825 --> 16:52.703
Sorry. Just a burp.

16:53.574 --> 16:55.451
I know you're just
trying to cheer me up.

16:55.571 --> 16:56.641
No, trust me.

16:56.936 --> 16:59.954
There have been times when I wanted
to tell people you're a terrible dad.

17:00.074 --> 17:01.137
But you're not.

17:01.257 --> 17:02.819
You spend tons of time with Sam,

17:02.939 --> 17:04.830
call him every night
so he can hear your voice.

17:04.951 --> 17:07.432
You write him all those stories
about unicorns. Seriously...

17:07.732 --> 17:10.101
- How do you come up with so many?
- They just come to me.

17:10.221 --> 17:12.788
- I got to get them out, you know?
- No, I don't know.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.641
- They're magical.
- They're not.

17:15.444 --> 17:18.291
Whatever is making Sam
cry, it's not about you.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.409
It's about him. Babies are
sensitive to all kinds of things.

17:21.529 --> 17:24.856
Bright lights,
temperature, new smells.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.207
The Cologne I've been
wearing to try and punish Elliot!

17:29.765 --> 17:31.913
Thanks for the shower
and the loaner clothes.

17:32.195 --> 17:35.529
Look at that face. It's like
he got all of our best features.

17:35.762 --> 17:37.186
No, he got your chin.

17:38.188 --> 17:39.452
I'm having a moment.

17:43.636 --> 17:45.722
Bob, would you please
close the back of that thing up?

17:45.842 --> 17:47.943
Calm down, Perry.
It's for the ladies.

17:48.063 --> 17:49.599
I'm sure they're grateful.

17:49.719 --> 17:52.847
Why did you check yourself in to
the hospital for a glorified flu bug?

17:52.967 --> 17:55.493
In my defense, I thought
I might also be dealing

17:55.613 --> 17:57.909
with some issues
from eating raw starfish.

17:59.307 --> 18:02.461
You know what I realized
when I was treating myself?

18:03.709 --> 18:05.240
I miss being a doctor.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.099
Now is your chance to get
back to the game there, big guy.

18:08.332 --> 18:10.651
Am I wrong to not hire Gandhi?

18:11.031 --> 18:12.905
I thought it was
gonna be something doctory.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.813
- Of course you're wrong.
- He bothers me.

18:14.933 --> 18:18.287
Everybody bothers you. Hell, you used
to bother me when I was the Chief

18:18.407 --> 18:21.648
but I kept moving you up because
you were the best man for the job.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.074
Now, the question is,

18:23.194 --> 18:25.735
"Is Turkleton
the best man for the job?"

18:27.438 --> 18:29.451
Some pretty good stitches
you got going there.

18:30.322 --> 18:32.359
I used to be terrible at it,

18:32.479 --> 18:35.529
but Dr. Turk made us practice with
oranges every day to get better.

18:38.156 --> 18:39.677
Nice butt.

18:39.797 --> 18:41.272
Thank you, darling.

18:41.392 --> 18:42.865
Suck it, Perry.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.390
<i>Elliot came over later.</i>

18:49.510 --> 18:53.120
<i>Even though it was better, I wouldn't
say the awkwardness was totally gone.</i>

18:55.696 --> 18:58.334
Weird flashback, like
the ghost of couples passed.

19:00.981 --> 19:03.257
It's your house, It's your house.
It's so silly...

19:05.371 --> 19:06.570
Ladies should sit.

19:07.270 --> 19:08.472
That's kinda weird.

19:13.046 --> 19:14.212
We're the guests.

19:14.806 --> 19:16.758
The guests. The guests
will sit on the couch.

19:16.878 --> 19:19.714
- That's where guests sit.
- Can I get you guys anything?

19:20.090 --> 19:21.440
Wine, maybe?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.203
- I'll have a yogurt.
- Don't start.

19:23.706 --> 19:25.838
You know what we should do?
Sam's napping.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.120
Let's watch this video
I've been making of him.

19:28.758 --> 19:31.973
<i>There are moments in your life that make
you realize what you've been missing.</i>

19:33.037 --> 19:34.890
<i>Whether it's an old job...</i>

19:41.349 --> 19:43.423
<i>Or the best person for a new job.</i>

19:48.597 --> 19:50.947
Congratulations.
You're the new Chief of Surgery.

19:51.404 --> 19:53.612
- Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.

19:59.572 --> 20:01.572
I told you. I told you, baby!

20:01.692 --> 20:04.112
I told everyone. Climb!
I told everyone!

20:04.232 --> 20:05.578
Hail to the Chief!

20:06.270 --> 20:08.466
So there he is with
his little red wagon.

20:09.865 --> 20:11.595
And that's my cousin's puppy.

20:11.715 --> 20:15.435
<i>As I sat there, enjoying
images from my son's young life,</i>

20:15.555 --> 20:19.067
<i>I realized I was seeing these moments
the same way Sean and Elliot were.</i>

20:19.187 --> 20:20.497
<i>For the first time.</i>

20:20.617 --> 20:21.596
<i>But truth is,</i>

20:21.716 --> 20:24.809
<i>no matter how hard I tried,
I was gonna miss a lot of them.</i>

20:25.472 --> 20:28.319
<i>Because even the best
part-time father in the world...</i>

20:28.708 --> 20:30.552
<i>is still a part-time father.</i>

20:31.546 --> 20:33.325
I think I'm gonna move here.

20:36.144 --> 20:37.101
Great.

20:43.696 --> 20:45.009
I'm not wearing that.

20:45.252 --> 20:46.481
It's not up to you.

20:47.831 --> 20:48.874
Fine.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.788
It is kinda cool.

20:55.122 --> 20:56.239
I want it back.

20:56.910 --> 20:59.156
Too late!
Chief coming through!

21:00.935 --> 21:01.978
Salute!

21:02.959 --> 21:04.432
There it is!

21:05.470 --> 21:06.931
I'll just wear my other one.
