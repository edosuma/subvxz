00:01.160 --> 00:05.050
I was reading an article the other
day-- by which I mean I was watching tv--

00:05.070 --> 00:09.590
and it said happiness comes from realizing
which things in life you just can't control,

00:09.600 --> 00:12.500
and then controlling
them, even if it kills you.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.970
That might not have been the
lesson. I was flipping around.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.580
So how did you and todd leave it?

00:16.590 --> 00:19.430
- Uh, we didn't, because he did all the leaving.
- I know.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.420
He storms in the house, he kisses me,
yells at me... and then he just left.

00:23.430 --> 00:26.760
Yep. I got yelled at once by
a guy right after he kissed me,

00:26.770 --> 00:29.800
and my braces got
stuck in his ghewingum.

00:29.810 --> 00:32.430
He was a bad therapist.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.580
What do you think it means?
And why would he do that?

00:36.590 --> 00:38.780
You know, I couldn't sleep at
all last night because of it.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.980
I'm sure he couldn't either.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.490
He probably had sex with
chloe to calm himself down.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.970
Great. Glad I could really
help their relationship.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.050
- Newly.
- Mr. Chapman.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.450
Oh, god. My heart
can't take this anymore.

00:50.460 --> 00:52.380
That's it. You know what? That's it.

00:52.390 --> 00:55.050
I am not gonna care
about anybody ever again.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.100
- Sam, it's a dog.
- What?

00:57.110 --> 00:58.780
You can't control love.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.460
I mean, when I got my first
newfie--newf gingrich--

01:01.470 --> 01:03.050
you know, I never
took him out on a walk.

01:03.060 --> 01:05.310
I was afraid he'd get off
the leash and run away.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.420
And he was miserable.

01:06.430 --> 01:09.030
I mean, dogs are meant to get
out, romp around, get messy,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.530
you know, eat their
neighbor's tulips sometimes.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.730
It's part of their nature.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.210
So let nature take its course.

01:14.220 --> 01:15.260
Let your heart be a dog.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.630
My dad's really mad about those tulips.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.240
call me when you talk to todd.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.300
your friend... I want
her. Make it happen.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.860
Um, you want to ask dena out?

01:54.870 --> 01:55.520
Uh, problem?

01:55.530 --> 01:57.170
Oh, god. So many.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.450
- You know what I did this morning?
- No.

01:59.460 --> 02:03.200
I wrote the final alimony
check to my ex-wife.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.090
Should be a celebration, right?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.240
Like the day my dad and
i settled out of court.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.669
But you see, then I realized
the second the ink dried that

02:10.680 --> 02:15.220
that was the last human
connection I had in the world.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.090
Now I heard what your
friend said about love,

02:17.120 --> 02:19.580
and that is the type of
attitude that I need in my life.

02:19.590 --> 02:21.160
My heart's not a dog.

02:21.170 --> 02:23.460
I mean, I-I-I
wish it were a dog.

02:23.470 --> 02:26.310
You know what, though?
Dogs are--dogs are hard.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.270
You know, they're always dragging
their butts across the floor or--

02:29.280 --> 02:31.600
so what are you trying to say,
that your bottom line is "no"?

02:31.610 --> 02:34.360
That everyone else gets to be
happy except me? Is that it?

02:34.370 --> 02:35.640
Well, I'm no philosopher.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.910
Okay, you know what? Go to the mall.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.620
Don't be mean!

02:39.630 --> 02:42.480
- I mean, just because I'm a
woman, doesn't- - your mall project.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.750
The little $200 million development?

02:44.760 --> 02:47.260
Groundbreaking today?

02:47.270 --> 02:50.830
My mall project. Right.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.770
No, I-I thought you
said "small project,"

02:54.780 --> 02:58.560
and, um, I don't do those.

02:58.570 --> 03:02.330
Chapman actually started to
ta to me about his feelings.

03:02.740 --> 03:05.990
It was like if the toaster
started talking about the weather.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.500
I mean, he actually expected
me to set him up with dena.

03:08.510 --> 03:10.020
- Oh, do it!
- What?

03:10.030 --> 03:11.200
- Yes!
- No way!

03:11.210 --> 03:12.260
- Do it!
- No!

03:12.270 --> 03:15.850
Our best friend dates our
boss. She becomes our pipeline.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.120
We start to mention things
that we want, and bam!

03:18.130 --> 03:21.200
We got those leather desk chairs
that mold to the shape of your butt.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.500
No, no. I am not gonna
pimp dena out, all right?

03:23.510 --> 03:25.510
I would never use somebody
for something like that.

03:25.530 --> 03:30.590
And since when is she your best friend who got
up in the middle of the night to pick her up

03:30.600 --> 03:32.930
when her stupid car ran
out of gas last month?

03:32.940 --> 03:35.110
Uh, me?

03:35.120 --> 03:36.800
Oh, so now all of a
sudden you have a memory?

03:36.810 --> 03:38.040
- That's very convenient.
- Yeah.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.400
Uh, morning, miss newly.

03:39.410 --> 03:41.270
Here's your hard hat
and your golden shovel.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.620
I get a hard hat?

03:42.640 --> 03:46.000
Oh, can you believe that this
is all mine? That I did this?

03:46.010 --> 03:49.050
it's her! She did this!

03:49.590 --> 03:51.230
- Who are they?
- Protesters.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.060
Well, what-- what
are they protesting?

03:53.070 --> 03:55.290
Butterfly killer!

03:55.300 --> 03:57.420
Oh, right.

03:57.430 --> 04:02.020
I'm just saying as legal counsel, you are
going to have problems if you build here.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.990
The environmental
impact report says that

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
this is the habitat for some
endangered blue butterfly.

04:09.010 --> 04:12.780
Parenting books, golf, ohio...

04:12.790 --> 04:13.520
what are you doing?

04:13.530 --> 04:17.230
Oh, just listing other things
that I couldn't give a crap about.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.510
I am a killer.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.459
I have butterfly blood ha my nds.

04:20.470 --> 04:21.890
Oh, I don't think they have blood.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.220
They're like birds.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.820
I mean, this is my legacy?

04:24.830 --> 04:27.700
No, no, no. That is
not who I am anymore.

04:27.710 --> 04:30.330
I have to get to chapman and tell
him to call this whole thing off.

04:30.340 --> 04:34.010
Sure. You just need a way
to pay back the $200 million.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.870
maybe a bake sale.

04:35.880 --> 04:40.180
No, there's a way to get
to him. There has to be.

04:40.190 --> 04:43.460
You know who needs to date more? You.

04:43.470 --> 04:44.340
What?

04:44.350 --> 04:46.660
Yeah. You need a man.

04:46.670 --> 04:49.870
Oh, I don't know. Dating
is dangerous for me.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.910
I get too close too
fast, and then I get hurt,

04:52.920 --> 04:58.670
like a little sparrow that keeps flying into the same
windowpane over and over and over and over and over--

04:59.250 --> 05:04.780
lookho's here! mr. Chapman!
What a surprise! 'Sup?

05:04.790 --> 05:08.600
Uh, dena, you remember
mr. Chapman? Chase.

05:08.610 --> 05:10.790
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.210
- Eyes up.
- Yeah.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.200
Yeah.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.630
Taking control

05:18.380 --> 05:22.220
So... how was, uh, how
was chapman after I left?

05:22.230 --> 05:23.600
Really nice.

05:23.610 --> 05:25.290
You always said what a creep he was.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.820
Me? No.

05:26.830 --> 05:30.040
Yeah, remember? You said, "he's so
creepy. He's always so, so super creepy."

05:30.050 --> 05:33.490
No. No. I-- he
is... oh, great.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.960
I know. I think so, too.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.180
I think I'm seeing him again.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.590
- Seeing who?
- Who?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.870
"Who, who, who, who?"
Who let that owl in here?

05:39.880 --> 05:42.230
Hey, I think I might see
you guys at work today.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.950
Chase asked me to stop by for lunch.

05:46.770 --> 05:49.200
ohyou know...

05:51.950 --> 05:53.410
okay, it is not the same.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.090
I thought you said we
don't use our friends.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.800
Not for chairs. All right?

05:56.810 --> 05:59.580
If you want a butt chair, you
can buy yourself a butt chair.

05:59.590 --> 06:01.940
This is the only way
that I can save a species.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.890
I am doing this because
I care about the world.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.150
oh, sam, look. Todd.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.820
oh, god. Here we go.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.130
This is the first talk since
the kiss. It's kind of weird.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.790
What if we kiss again? Hey,
do I have coffee breath?

06:15.800 --> 06:16.560
Yes.

06:16.570 --> 06:19.100
I do? I need a mint.

06:20.220 --> 06:23.450
- So you and chapman, huh?
- Yeah.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.520
It's kind of
exciting. I think--

06:25.530 --> 06:27.490
What--what
is it?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.070
It's just my back.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.400
Oh, they have me sitting on
these stupid chairs at work.

06:37.050 --> 06:37.990
How are you?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.490
I'm good. I'm real good.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.570
Oh, you got a newspaper there, huh?

06:43.580 --> 06:46.700
any, uh, big news in
your life there lately?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.500
Yeah. Yeah, pretty big.

06:48.510 --> 06:51.590
Oh, really? How big?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.970
I got a job as a
freelancer at the paper.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.340
Look. That's my first photo.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.990
I'm gonna go call my mom.

07:02.070 --> 07:04.850
tell her you're a robot?

07:06.020 --> 07:07.610
Hello. Where you off to?

07:07.620 --> 07:11.510
Out with dena. We are
going to make topiaries.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.560
That's all I know.

07:13.570 --> 07:16.250
You're going to clip, clip, hooray?

07:16.260 --> 07:17.860
You refused to go with me.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.300
Guess it's cooler to go with dena.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.340
Trust me, it is not.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.440
No, it's a long story.

07:22.450 --> 07:25.410
It's just--I'm--I'm trying
to suck up to de--to, um,

07:25.420 --> 07:27.720
just do things with dena
that she likes to do.

07:27.730 --> 07:31.430
And she wants to give chapman
a-a topiary of his head.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.520
Actually, it's--it's-- it's not a long
story 'cause that's-- that's the story.

07:35.530 --> 07:36.940
Funk, now chapman.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.630
That is two bosses you've let get away.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.300
Wh--just how poor does a man
have to be before you'll date him?

07:42.310 --> 07:45.020
- Not really a good subject right now.
- Why?

07:46.080 --> 07:48.550
Oh, sweetheart,
what--what's wrong?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.260
I kissed todd the other night.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.800
Of course you did.

07:51.810 --> 07:54.630
He makes what, $800 a year?

07:54.640 --> 07:59.590
No, it just--it's--- I saw him today,
and he acted like nothing ever happened.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.860
Well, maybe it didn'T.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.190
It did happen.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.780
Well, maybe you imagined it.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.770
I did not imagine being kissed.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.110
You suffered a very serious head injury.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.440
I can't believe you guys wanted
to come here. You never want to.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.100
What? Yeah-huh. I
al--I always did.

08:16.110 --> 08:18.710
I just, uh, I never
thought we could get in.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.350
So... Look what I made.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.360
A... moose head!

08:26.370 --> 08:29.540
No, it's a butterfly. Yeah.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.960
Speaking of which, have I talked
to you about my mall project?

08:32.970 --> 08:36.539
Hey, deens, did you know that an ergonomic
chair could add ten years to your life?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.590
Did you know that the
karner blue butterfly--

08:38.600 --> 08:40.470
it only breeds twice a year.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.600
Did you know you get scoliosis
from bad office chairs?

08:42.610 --> 08:45.650
Also these butterflies--th can
only survive on wild lupines.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.170
- That's crazy, huh?
- My grandma has a hump.

08:47.180 --> 08:48.760
Save the butterflies!

08:48.770 --> 08:50.300
Sam, what is going on?

08:50.310 --> 08:51.640
I'm upset.

08:51.650 --> 08:56.950
This mall project is gonna wipe out an
entire species of life from this planet.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.480
But, no, please, let's hear
more about your nana's hump.

09:00.490 --> 09:02.120
Oh, my. That's awful!

09:02.130 --> 09:03.900
It is a big hump.

09:03.910 --> 09:09.520
Yeah, I know. I know, but I just-- I don't have
any idea how to talk to mr. Chapman about it.

09:09.530 --> 09:14.810
well, uh, I don't know. Maybe...
maybe I could talk to him about it.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.620
Well, there's an idea.

09:17.630 --> 09:22.700
Yeah, I mean, if you, uh, if you don't--if
you don't mind. You know, whatever.

09:25.310 --> 09:29.380
I'm not here with you. I'm
just here. It's a free country.

09:29.390 --> 09:31.830
Nice moose.

09:35.570 --> 09:38.360
well, hello. Good morning.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.670
Good morng.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.220
And how are you?

09:41.240 --> 09:44.820
Yes, you got a new chair.
I see that. How is it?

09:44.830 --> 09:46.480
It hurts. Do you want it?

09:46.490 --> 09:48.130
I'm going for the cappuccino maker.

09:48.140 --> 09:52.620
Nope, but thank you, dena.
Let's go see what I've won.

09:58.710 --> 10:01.650
- I just, uh, I stopped
by to- - thank you.

10:01.660 --> 10:04.310
Ah, you have, um... you have a little...

10:04.320 --> 10:05.850
just... never mind.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.030
Um, did you-- did you talk
to him about the mall project?

10:09.040 --> 10:10.730
- I sure did.
- You bet.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.010
Thank you. Thank you.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.040
Uh, you know, he had
some really good points.

10:14.050 --> 10:17.880
Did you know the project is gonna
inject cash into an impoverished area

10:17.890 --> 10:21.080
and create jobs and
retail opportunities?

10:21.090 --> 10:22.960
You know, he really won me over.

10:22.970 --> 10:26.110
But wait. You--wait. It's--it's
still--it's still happening?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.700
Yeah.

10:34.290 --> 10:37.500
So bottom line it for me.
Does she like me or what?

10:40.060 --> 10:41.620
Look what I found.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.580
These are some of the
old plans for the mall.

10:43.590 --> 10:46.150
And in some of them,
in the early ones...

10:46.180 --> 10:48.830
they don't have to kill the butterflies,
so if I can just stall chap--

10:48.840 --> 10:49.940
could you just stop that?

10:49.960 --> 10:51.910
Sorry. Just making a cappuccino.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.950
Yeah, I see you got
your cappuccino machine.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.880
I'm just so glad that this
is all working out for you.

10:55.890 --> 10:59.820
But in my world, on monday, a bunch of
bulldozers are gonna be killing butterflies.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.990
So what I need to do is...I
need to find a way that I can--

11:03.000 --> 11:05.640
that I can make chapman halt
the project so I can review.

11:05.650 --> 11:08.580
Okay, now you're just,
you know, playing with it.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.020
Hey there.

11:12.030 --> 11:15.860
Mr. Chapman, you are just
the man that I wanted to see.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.190
- I just found...
- so come on.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.770
- What does dena say about me?
- Alternate plans.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.590
- I, uh, I don't know, because
we don't discuss- - sure you do.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.360
'Cause here's the thing.

11:25.370 --> 11:28.100
I like her. I wrote a poem about her.

11:28.110 --> 11:30.430
You want to hear it? Check it out.

11:32.910 --> 11:36.910
"Here I go down the slippery slope,
downward tumbling, softly mumbling."

11:36.920 --> 11:39.130
I am just so uncomfortable.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.700
What can I buy her? Women
like stockings, right?

11:41.710 --> 11:44.790
I saw that in a play. You
see, sam, here's the thing.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.890
I feel like I might be comingn a
little too strong, because last night,

11:47.900 --> 11:53.690
we were sitting on her couch, and
my hand might have gone somewhere.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.910
But it was completely accidental.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.840
- I was only trying to retrieve a quarter.
- Stop!

12:00.890 --> 12:05.140
Because... maybe you are.

12:05.750 --> 12:06.970
Maybe what?

12:06.980 --> 12:09.920
Coming on a little bit too strong, man.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.060
See, dena, um, she has
this pattern where, uh,

12:13.070 --> 12:16.730
if--if she starts to feel
crowded, she just runs.

12:16.740 --> 12:18.290
Am I crowding her?

12:18.300 --> 12:20.240
well, I mean, how will
I know? Can you find out?

12:20.250 --> 12:22.800
Well, maybe.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.500
But then you're gonna owe me, mister.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.680
Crowding him? That's what he said?

12:27.690 --> 12:30.920
Because I was supposed to go see his band
play tonight, and you're invited, too.

12:30.930 --> 12:33.220
Oh, darn. That would've been fun.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.650
Look, just back off a
little bit, you know?

12:35.660 --> 12:37.760
Just show a-- show a
little indifference.

12:37.770 --> 12:39.990
Yeah, I told you, I do this.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.300
You know, I-I get too
close too fastand oh, god!

12:43.310 --> 12:45.800
I never should have given him
the mug with my face on it.

12:45.810 --> 12:48.920
You were right. Never care. Never care.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.320
It's like the windowpane.

12:50.330 --> 12:54.810
- Here it comes again and again and again
and over-- - no, no, no, no, no, no.Dena.Dena.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.380
Just listen to me. I can help you.

12:57.390 --> 13:00.560
You just need to do exactly what I say.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.100
Okay, now she won't even
return my phone calls,

13:04.120 --> 13:08.800
and she didn't even come to see my band,
and I played cowbell on "sister christian."

13:08.810 --> 13:10.150
Hard song.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.390
Look, it's, um, it's a little
bit worse than I thought.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.540
Her old boyfriend came into town.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.650
What? No. No.

13:18.660 --> 13:21.350
Sam, I blew it. I can't lose her.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.850
I miss her fingers. I miss
the way her skin tastes.

13:23.860 --> 13:24.750
Anyway...

13:24.760 --> 13:26.530
sam, you have to help me get her back.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.600
You know, I really just
don't want to get involved.

13:28.610 --> 13:30.180
You must. I will do anything.

13:30.190 --> 13:31.920
Postpone the mall project.

13:31.930 --> 13:35.100
I knew you were gonna say that. Done.

13:35.110 --> 13:38.880
Hey, dena. Um, it worked.
Yeah. Uh, oh, god. Yeah.

13:38.890 --> 13:40.840
He, um, he misses you terribly.

13:40.850 --> 13:44.590
So you may answer his call. Okay. Bye.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.210
Yes, you are very pretty, but
if I lose a friend over this,

13:49.220 --> 13:53.000
I am going to make a wind chime
out of you and your entire family.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.110
where we first met.

13:56.120 --> 13:59.330
I love that you brought
me here. Like it.

13:59.340 --> 14:02.590
I like it. I like it. it's okay.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.490
Yep, scene of the crime.
See anything you like?

14:05.500 --> 14:09.030
Oh, you know, whatever.
Pretty indifferent.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.890
Really? 'Cause I'm thinking
maybe I'll have a salad.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.550
- Okay, who is he?
- What?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.380
You know, I know sam told
me not to say anything,

14:14.390 --> 14:18.450
and I'm so sorry that I'm not
really cool about everything.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.670
But I'm a human being.
If you cut me, I bleed.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.050
And it doesn't even have
to be the biggest cut

14:22.060 --> 14:24.650
because my body produces fewer
clotting factors than average,

14:24.660 --> 14:25.740
so even the smallest
bleeding takes forever--

14:25.750 --> 14:28.570
chase, what the hell
are you talking about?

14:28.580 --> 14:30.970
coming. Coming. Coming. Gosh.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.050
Shame on you!

14:32.060 --> 14:35.170
Oh, how so many of my
conversations start out like that.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.690
You sold my heart for your job?

14:37.700 --> 14:40.750
I'm supposed to be your friend,
and you took advantage of me.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.170
I'm beginning to wonder if
you even wanted to do topiary.

14:44.180 --> 14:49.300
Dena, we could just spend all night trying to
figure out who did what to who and--and why--

14:49.310 --> 14:52.800
no, you don't have to
say why you did it, sam.

14:52.810 --> 14:56.240
You did it because you could.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.530
I'm just glad that I still have
one friend that I can count on.

14:59.540 --> 15:02.810
Come on, andrea. Chase
is taking us to karaoke.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.530
Karaoke! Yay!

15:08.510 --> 15:11.480
and, sam, chase says the
bulldozers roll in the morning.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.380
Yeah.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.630
Karaoke with the boss?

15:17.940 --> 15:20.710
could have been you.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.960
{\a6}Taking BACK control

15:23.090 --> 15:29.260
Who started this, so, um, I'm here
to give these butterflies a voice.

15:29.270 --> 15:33.130
Or maybe they--they have
voices. I-I really don't know.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.540
But if they do, they're
probably pretty small, like...

15:36.550 --> 15:41.180
help us! we are here!

15:41.880 --> 15:43.150
I don't know.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.530
But now we are here, and no
one is going to leave this spot

15:47.540 --> 15:51.150
until these butteries are safe!Yes!

15:51.160 --> 15:53.610
Except for you. And you, too.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.290
hey, wait. Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.500
- see that the color scheme of the hallway...
- yeah.

16:00.510 --> 16:01.910
And into the bedroom here...

16:01.920 --> 16:04.220
I put it on the walls and
on the wainscoting there.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.060
- Oh, really?
- You like that?

16:05.070 --> 16:07.190
Did you--wait. I thought it was--
wasn't it pronounced "wain-scotting"?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.330
I don't know what it was called.

16:08.340 --> 16:11.680
Because I-I actually
thought the terminology...

16:12.900 --> 16:15.340
what? What?

16:15.350 --> 16:17.300
Um, them.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.330
oh, no. Just ignore them.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.180
- Al rely?
- Yeah.

16:20.190 --> 16:21.710
'Cause th--they're--
they're staring at me.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.940
- They can't really see-- you know what? - Yeah,
it's just--it's really, it's un-unsexy, kind of.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.270
I can do this. Okay. Okay.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.260
If I turn on the tv,
they'll go right to sleep.

16:29.270 --> 16:33.110
chapman & funk say nature is junk.
Chapman & funk say nature is junk.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.210
Yeah, I know I'm probably
gonna lose my job over this,

16:35.220 --> 16:37.700
- but I don't care.
- Oh, my god. It's sam.

16:37.710 --> 16:42.390
Because you know what? You can't do
a corrupting job and stay uncorrupted.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.430
And--and now I have let
it corrupt my friendships.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.690
You know, I wrote
you an erotic poem--

16:48.700 --> 16:54.340
See, when you-- when you find something that
is--that is beautiful and delicate in this world,

16:54.350 --> 17:00.480
you--you--you have to protect it, not--not
just use it up and--and shove it aside...

17:02.220 --> 17:04.890
just 'cause you can.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.900
I forgive you, sam.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.750
I think the dogs are
sleeping now, so maybe--

17:10.760 --> 17:13.069
I said shh!

17:17.700 --> 17:21.280
is that w we take care of our wings?

17:21.290 --> 17:24.750
I know it's just
bulldozer scoop, but, uh,

17:24.760 --> 17:27.750
it does say a little something
about how you were raised.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.390
why are you here?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.100
Well, you're all over the local news.

17:32.110 --> 17:38.340
I tuned in to see what dangers were lurking
on my kitchen counters, and there you were.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.160
But how did I look?

17:40.170 --> 17:43.570
You looked... natural.

17:44.380 --> 17:48.220
Like, um, like it suited you better.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.620
Better than what?

17:50.930 --> 17:55.230
Better than that job of yours.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.530
you know, when I first
saw you on tv doing this,

17:59.540 --> 18:04.190
I-I felt a real swell of pride.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.950
I didn't know what it was at
first. It had been so long.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.570
I thought maybe I'd gotten some
bad sour cream or something.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.210
But, um...

18:14.120 --> 18:16.690
I'm very proud of you.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:19.370 --> 18:22.990
I mean, for the scarf, 'cause I was
actually starting to get a little cold.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.380
Oh, it's not for the cold.

18:24.390 --> 18:27.870
On tv, your neck looked kinda crepe-Y.

18:35.960 --> 18:40.370
oh, my god. Oh, my god.
This is it. This is it.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.610
Mom. Mom. Mom.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.100
mom! Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

18:46.110 --> 18:47.930
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- What?

18:47.940 --> 18:50.420
This is the new me, the
new me. I'm tang a stand.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.250
I am making a difference right
here in front of this bulldozer.

18:54.260 --> 18:57.610
What? Dude, dude, dude. What?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.950
Oh, for pete's sake!

19:04.690 --> 19:06.850
Sweetheart, put the scarf on.

19:09.850 --> 19:14.650
so, yeah, the toughest part about being
new and trying to change is figuring out

19:14.660 --> 19:20.840
which things are even in your power
to control and which things are not.

19:27.070 --> 19:29.750
Just tell me, frank. I need to see todd.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.870
So is chloe up there or not?

19:32.880 --> 19:37.340
Because you know, uh, I
just quit my job, so, uh...

19:38.540 --> 19:41.080
I can wait here all day.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.130
That's not very impressive.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.120
I wait here all day every day.

19:53.010 --> 19:54.250
My feet hurt.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.520
You, stop!

19:57.660 --> 20:00.700
Oh, you can see me. I'm not invisible.

20:00.710 --> 20:02.710
Look, um...

20:03.220 --> 20:06.160
I'm sorry I blew you off when I
saw you the other day. I panicked.

20:06.170 --> 20:09.990
I mean, that wasn't even my photo in
the paper. I don't even have a job there.

20:10.730 --> 20:15.150
Look, the truth is, I-I shouldn't
have kissed you because I'm with chloe,

20:15.160 --> 20:18.420
and I-I need to give
that a chance, so...

20:30.430 --> 20:33.450
lose some sleep over that.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.070
It really is the hardest part--
that despite our very best efforts,

20:41.080 --> 20:45.900
some things just aren't meant to be,
while things that ar meant to be--

20:45.910 --> 20:48.150
ey seem to find a way.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.700
hey there, cute little guy.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.690
Oh, yeah. Yeah, better from far.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.790
Oh, yeah. Way better.
