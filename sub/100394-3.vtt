WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:07.964
- Previously
on "Project Blue Book"...

00:08.095 --> 00:09.226
- Cigar shaped craft

00:09.357 --> 00:10.488
nearly takes out an airplane.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.186
- The military
is hiding the truth.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.145
- The government is involved
in a massive conspiracy

00:15.276 --> 00:18.279
to cover up the evidence
of visitors from other worlds.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.150
When we try
to expose the truth,

00:20.281 --> 00:21.978
that makes us
enemies of the state.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.415
- But what does the FBI want
with civilian UFO groups?

00:24.546 --> 00:25.808
- They think we're dangerous.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.592
- I don't usually
move this fast.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.207
- I want Project Blue Book
to formally close

00:33.337 --> 00:34.599
the Roswell incident.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.428
- Closing Roswell
means reopening it.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.430
You put Blue Book
in that position

00:39.561 --> 00:41.302
and they fail,
those guys won't be

00:41.432 --> 00:43.869
the only ones
to lose their jobs.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.263
- How long can you pretend
to believe in something

00:46.394 --> 00:47.786
that you know is not true?

01:18.730 --> 01:21.298
- Sergeant, help!

01:21.429 --> 01:22.647
Help me!

01:55.376 --> 01:57.682
- Willingham, is that you?

01:57.813 --> 01:59.249
- He's been out here
for 12 hours.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.469
- They took him...
- Sergeant Willingham.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.340
- The aliens took him.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.081
- Its size and its appearance,

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
this thing
came from outer space.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.432
I even have reason to believe

02:08.563 --> 02:11.261
that there's some form
of life in it.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.698
- You think they're recreating
the Missouri crash?

02:13.829 --> 02:16.875
- Mm-mm.
The saucer's the wrong shape.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.922
This looks like
the Helena encounter to me.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.445
- But that was a hoax.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.143
- What do you think
the Missouri incident was?

02:23.273 --> 02:25.101
- But there were
12 witnesses, Allen.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.059
You think they were all lying?

02:29.627 --> 02:31.629
- What?
- You.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.979
You really know your stuff.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.200
- Well, I am typing up
all your research, Professor.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.116
- No, this goes beyond
my research.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.379
This is your UFO group, yes?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.425
- Mm.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.036
- Well, you seem to be
really enjoying it.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.343
- It's been really good for me.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.694
And honestly, with everything
we've been through,

02:52.824 --> 02:55.653
I think...

02:55.784 --> 02:58.003
I'm just looking for answers.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.788
- We both are.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.618
- I'm worried, though.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.185
About you.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.969
You've seen how far
the government will go

03:07.099 --> 03:08.231
to keep their secrets.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.973
If they wanted to,

03:11.103 --> 03:12.627
they could ruin you.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.759
- I know the risks, I do,

03:14.890 --> 03:17.545
but if I don't do this,

03:17.675 --> 03:18.763
you know, who will?

03:18.894 --> 03:21.201
- Even if it was in one piece,

03:21.331 --> 03:25.335
would anyone still walk around
after a concussion like that?

03:28.425 --> 03:29.731
- You hate this.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.603
- Well, no,
I wouldn't say that.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.736
Loathe might be a better word.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.654
Let's just go home.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.397
Hello?
Vicki?

03:43.527 --> 03:46.051
- Mrs. Hynek, I'm so sorry.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.270
I didn't know what to do.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.620
- Why, what's wrong?
- Is Joel okay?

03:49.751 --> 03:50.795
- Um...

03:50.926 --> 03:52.623
- Oh, General.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.669
- Doctor, Mrs. Hynek.

03:54.799 --> 03:57.541
So sorry to show up
unannounced like this.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.064
- It's probably best
we talk in private.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.850
- Sure, uh, maybe--

04:01.980 --> 04:04.461
- Of course, Vicki, would you?
- Yeah.

04:10.902 --> 04:14.471
- We had an incident
near Nellis Air Force Base.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.169
- Nevada.
- Place called Groom Lake.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.738
Couple of our guys, they seem
to have sighted a craft.

04:20.869 --> 04:24.438
One of them is still missing,
but there's a wrinkle.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.354
It happened on part of the base
run by the CIA.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.616
- The who?

04:28.746 --> 04:30.226
- It's a fairly new agency.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.749
Probably why you never
heard of 'em.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.099
- Truman put them together
after the war.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.886
Mostly just to collect intel,
but my experience of them

04:38.016 --> 04:39.583
is that they think
they're more than that.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.759
- Yeah, we fight
over the same turf now.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.588
- But we still
have to play nice.

04:44.719 --> 04:47.243
Especially now with
a new administration coming in.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
We make waves,
Eisenhower can just say

04:49.680 --> 04:51.508
he doesn't need
Blue Book any more.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.162
- Yeah, I'm sorry,
but are we to believe

04:53.293 --> 04:54.468
that someone has been abducted?

04:54.598 --> 04:56.383
Is that what I'm hearing?

04:56.513 --> 04:59.560
- No, what you're hearing
is I need you two

04:59.690 --> 05:01.866
to close this case
quickly and cleanly.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.391
Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.610
- Pack your bags
if you need to.

05:06.741 --> 05:10.005
Wheels up in an hour.
You can sleep on the plane.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.790
Gotta borrow him again,
Mrs. Hynek.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.097
- Duty calls.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.925
- Thank you
for your hospitality, ma'am.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.259
- Someone supposed
to meet us here?

05:47.390 --> 05:50.219
- I don't even know
where here is.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.923
- ♪ You ain't nothing
but a hound dog ♪

06:00.490 --> 06:01.709
♪ Been snoopin'
round my door ♪

06:03.363 --> 06:06.496
♪ You can wag your tail

06:06.627 --> 06:09.630
♪ But I ain't
gonna feed you no more ♪

06:12.328 --> 06:13.677
♪ You told me
you was high class ♪

06:15.505 --> 06:16.593
♪ But I could see
through that ♪

06:18.682 --> 06:21.685
- Sorry, guys, I always
underestimate that drive.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.166
Ah, Dr. Hynek, yes?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.994
Pleasure.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.299
Which makes you
Captain Michael Quinn.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.955
Look, we're very excited
to have you both here.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.304
- We're supposed
to be meeting

06:32.435 --> 06:33.697
someone from
Central Intelligence.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.612
Daniel Banks?

06:35.743 --> 06:37.484
- Just call me Dan.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.355
Come on,
we're burning daylight.

06:41.139 --> 06:44.316
You know, read a lot
of your case work.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.754
Very provocative
but very thorough.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.233
Lubbock especially was--

06:48.364 --> 06:50.279
- How have you read
our case files?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.846
- A big part of the CIA's job

06:51.976 --> 06:53.413
is about gathering intel,
Captain.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.240
- Are we headed for Nellis?

06:55.371 --> 06:57.678
- Nah, Nellis is that way,
toward Vegas.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.681
You guys ever been?
Oh, you gotta go.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.160
It's like
the Wild Wild West over there.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.598
The gambling,
the girls--girls.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.470
Oh, you're married, I'm sorry.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.690
- Oh, no, no,
we've talked about going.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.867
- Well, when you do, take her
to see Sinatra at the Sands.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.651
Yeah, you'll feel like
teenagers in love

07:14.782 --> 07:15.609
all over again.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.048
You more of a Mel Tormé fan,
I'm guessing.

07:20.178 --> 07:24.400
- No, haven't interacted much
with the agency.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.881
Just tryin' to get my read,
that's all.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.883
- You mean you're wondering
how a guy like me got the job.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.147
See, Central Intelligence
is all about

07:32.277 --> 07:35.933
staying off the radar,
operating in the shadows.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.545
I look like you,
I'm what people expect.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.155
So boss is smart enough
to realize that,

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
mix things up a bit.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.204
The truth, though, I was
the smartest man for the job.

07:48.946 --> 07:52.254
- So if we're not headed
to Nellis, where are we going?

07:52.384 --> 07:55.866
- This swath of desert here,
they call it Groom Lake.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.522
Army, Air Force, Navy,
they all have facilities here.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.398
- What, we outta gas?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.052
- Nope, just need
to knock to enter

08:08.183 --> 08:09.532
the CIA's little
neck of the woods.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.534
12-4-84 requesting permission

08:11.665 --> 08:13.797
to bring in
my guests for dinner.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.670
12-4-84,
you are cleared for entry.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.628
- Copy that.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.065
Congratulations, gentlemen,
you have arrived.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.894
- Arrived where?
I don't see a base anywhere.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.548
- This is just
the outer perimeter.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.332
Without my clearance,
you'd be shot.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.596
Welcome to Area 51.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.568
- CIA initially wanted

08:45.699 --> 08:46.743
to handle this internally,

08:46.874 --> 08:48.310
but when I heard
the sergeant's story,

08:48.440 --> 08:50.007
I said, "No way.
We need the experts."

08:50.138 --> 08:51.531
That's you guys.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.142
- What exactly goes on
here at Area 51?

08:54.272 --> 08:56.840
- Well, there's the cover story
or the disinformation campaign.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.103
- I'm not following.
- He's saying it's classified.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.629
I'm sure the captain's
heard a few rumors.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.587
- Experimental weapons
and aircraft.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.241
Boys playing with toys,
basically.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.721
Boys with toys.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.853
Yeah, something like that.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.683
- So this Sergeant Willingham?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.642
- A good man,
according to his CO.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.295
After he reported
Miller missing,

09:17.426 --> 09:19.210
we sent out
some of our guys,

09:19.341 --> 09:21.604
and they found Willingham
wandering about 5 klicks north.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.824
Had no idea where he was.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.477
- And this talk about aliens?

09:25.608 --> 09:27.044
- Hasn't changed
his story one bit.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.785
- Well, wandering around
in the desert,

09:28.916 --> 09:30.395
heatstroke can cause
hallucinations.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.094
- That's the thing,
the doctors who examined him

09:33.224 --> 09:34.530
said all fluids were normal.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.358
Didn't even have a sunburn.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.099
- Still no sign
of the corporal?

09:38.229 --> 09:39.970
- We had spotter planes flying
that grid since yesterday.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.493
Nothing.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.020
Ah, you have it?

09:47.499 --> 09:49.153
I thought I said
bring the good stuff.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.895
That's okay, this'll do.
Thank you.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.202
- Liquid lunch?

09:54.332 --> 09:55.812
- That's not
how I roll, Captain.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.905
Sergeant.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.386
This is Captain Quinn
and Dr. Hynek.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.780
Project Blue Book.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.216
You came.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.046
Is that, uh--

10:12.176 --> 10:13.787
- But just one glass,
all right?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.615
Like I said.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.628
Thank you.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.934
He's the only one
who didn't think I was crazy.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.895
Just, my nerves have been
like this ever since--

10:35.025 --> 10:36.461
- It's okay, it's all right,
it's all right.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.767
You're in good hands now, okay?

10:37.898 --> 10:40.335
This is their specialty.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.250
Just tell them
what you told me.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.426
What you remember.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.950
- Sure.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.605
Miller and I were tasked
to sector bravo.

10:49.736 --> 10:53.174
- It's everywhere, see?

10:53.304 --> 10:55.306
- Miller was goofing around
like always.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.091
Think you're funny, huh?

10:57.221 --> 10:58.658
- No, sir, I think it's crazy

10:58.788 --> 11:00.877
we're out here
in the first place.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.705
Looking for scraps of metal
from a missile

11:02.836 --> 11:06.535
that blew up two miles
that way.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.842
- We'd been out there all day
in 100-degree heat.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.628
Miller was getting
on my nerves.

11:12.759 --> 11:13.977
You go find something,

11:14.108 --> 11:17.415
then I'll give you
a drink, Corporal.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.852
I don't know how long
it was after,

11:18.982 --> 11:21.332
maybe a minute, maybe more.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.770
I lost track of time.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.076
And then, um...

11:26.207 --> 11:28.513
then this wind
came out of nowhere.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.081
Felt almost electric.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.430
- Help!

11:32.561 --> 11:33.431
- Then I heard him again.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.085
- Sergeant!

11:35.216 --> 11:36.608
- You better not be
messing with me again.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.480
He was screaming.
- Help!

11:38.610 --> 11:40.874
- I ran up to the top
of the ridge.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.484
- Help me!

11:42.614 --> 11:45.008
- I looked up and, uh...

11:45.139 --> 11:48.359
the--a ship appeared
in front of me.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.057
- Oh, my God!

11:50.187 --> 11:52.015
- Miller was sucked up inside.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.104
- Help!

11:54.235 --> 11:58.500
- And then, um, I don't
remember anything after that.

12:03.331 --> 12:06.551
You ever hear anything
like that before?

12:06.682 --> 12:09.380
- Well, we've heard
all kinds of stories.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.687
- But nothing like this.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.649
- They're gonna section-8
the poor bastard

12:17.780 --> 12:19.869
if he keeps talking like that.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.916
Thing is, I believe him.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.395
- Well, I mean,
it's clear to me

12:24.526 --> 12:26.571
that he certainly believes
he had some kind of encounter.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.225
- You're thinking we should
all go out there.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.750
- We've had our guys
combing that desert nonstop.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.230
- No, no, no, no, we need
to go with the sergeant.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.102
I mean, sometimes, you know,
revisiting the scene

12:35.232 --> 12:37.626
can help trigger a memory.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.106
- Smart.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.890
We'll just need to get
you guys cleared first.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.632
- For what, the desert?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.242
- See, this whole place
operates

12:45.373 --> 12:47.767
on a compartmentalized
information protocol.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.117
Means no one goes anywhere
without authorization.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.858
- How 'bout the john?

12:51.988 --> 12:54.425
- Ah, we have snipers
in there too.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.561
- What do you know
about Groom Lake?

12:59.691 --> 13:01.868
- Terry Milton takes
this photo of a UFO...

13:01.998 --> 13:05.175
- You just say Groom Lake?
- You know it?

13:05.306 --> 13:07.612
- Of course I know it.
I'm just impressed that you do.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.615
- I heard about
a sighting there.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.095
- From your husband?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.185
- From my research.

13:15.316 --> 13:18.232
- Oh.
That's not surprising.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.581
Get a decent view of the base,

13:19.711 --> 13:22.279
you can catch a UFO show
every night.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.934
- And what about abductions?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.414
- No, it's not like that.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.068
These UFOs, they're friendlies.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.681
- "Friendlies"?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.944
- You know that craft
they recovered in '47?

13:35.075 --> 13:36.903
- Mm-hmm, Roswell.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.382
- Well, it didn't
stay there long.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.558
They sent that thing
to Groom Lake,

13:40.689 --> 13:43.039
and that is where
they reverse-engineered it

13:43.170 --> 13:45.346
to make our very own
flying saucers.

13:45.476 --> 13:48.175
- So that's what people
are seeing in the sky?

13:50.786 --> 13:54.007
- Mimi, these days,

13:54.137 --> 13:56.444
you never know what
the government is capable of.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.406
Besides,
if you're gonna hide a UFO,

14:02.537 --> 14:04.669
where better
than the middle of the desert?

14:08.282 --> 14:11.241
- Soldiers were sent out here
to gather debris.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.548
- Lot of desert out here.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.812
- Lot of places
for a soldier to go missing.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.248
- Well, you've seen
our security, Captain.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.468
Soldiers don't
just go missing.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.480
- Any of this look familiar?

14:35.309 --> 14:36.963
I'm sorry.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.747
- Well, all looks
the same to me too.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.575
- Well, it's not all about
what you see, Captain.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.272
Memories are a combination

14:42.403 --> 14:45.362
of cognitive, sensory,
and emotional elements

14:45.493 --> 14:48.975
all working in tandem,
so you never know

14:49.105 --> 14:52.195
what may trigger
a memory trace.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.937
- That's Dr. Lashley, right?
On engrams?

14:55.068 --> 14:56.678
- Yeah, you familiar
with his work?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.549
- Neuroscience is a bit
of a hobby of mine.

15:00.464 --> 15:03.641
I know, handsome and well-read.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.729
Something to shoot for,
Captain.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.300
- Over here.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.562
- What is it, Sergeant?

15:14.435 --> 15:18.482
- Not sure.
It's more of a feeling.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.180
- Yeah, well, take your time.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.269
You know, keep walking around.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.967
- Just don't wander off
too far.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.317
- Any chance our corporal
took an unscheduled leave?

15:27.448 --> 15:29.493
- What, AWOL?
No, not likely.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.321
Only way out's
beyond that ridge,

15:31.452 --> 15:32.670
and that's a big no-no.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.411
- Another classified operation?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.848
Of the highest order.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.763
I'm talking shoot on sight.
- Who's doing the shooting?

15:38.894 --> 15:40.461
- Sergeant!

15:40.591 --> 15:42.158
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.204
- Hey, what's he doing?

15:44.334 --> 15:45.901
- Remembering.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.470
- Sergeant!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!

15:49.600 --> 15:51.385
- Sergeant!
- Hold up!

15:51.515 --> 15:53.953
- Down here!
- What the hell's he doing?

15:54.083 --> 15:56.129
- It's down here!
Hurry!

15:58.827 --> 16:01.438
I found it!
I found it!

16:01.569 --> 16:03.614
It's over here!

16:03.745 --> 16:07.053
Help me. Help me.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.924
- What is it?

16:09.055 --> 16:11.100
- There's something
underneath here.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.754
Is it rock?

16:14.886 --> 16:17.759
- It's not rock.
It's glass.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.935
- What are we looking at here?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.246
- The site of the abduction.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.257
- You know, sand doesn't melt
into glass unless

16:37.387 --> 16:39.389
the temperature is 3,000
degrees Fahrenheit.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.695
- I've seen glass formations
like this

16:40.825 --> 16:42.131
under a missile launch.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.220
- It came from that ship,
I'm telling you.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.048
- Okay, look, we're in
restricted territory here,

16:46.179 --> 16:47.658
and someone will notice.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.921
- Someone already did.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.662
- Maybe they know
what happened here.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.535
- If they do, they're not
gonna tell us, Captain.

16:54.665 --> 16:55.797
We gotta get back to the Jeep.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.756
Now.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.805
Captain, let's go.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.202
- Forgive me, Father,
I have sinned.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.030
It's been, uh...

17:15.860 --> 17:18.298
Actually, Father,
I don't even know why I'm here.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.170
- Something's weighing
heavy on your mind.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.437
Something about your faith.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.312
- What if, uh...

17:34.662 --> 17:38.622
What if I told you we
weren't alone in the universe?

17:38.753 --> 17:41.147
- I'd say you're right.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.670
- No, that's, uh...

17:45.281 --> 17:48.632
That's not what
I'm talking about, Father.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.417
The universe is a...

17:52.941 --> 17:54.290
It's a pretty big place,
Father.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.991
You know, the possibilities
of other life out there...

18:03.604 --> 18:04.692
How can there not be?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.827
- I'm not sure I follow.

18:13.483 --> 18:16.312
- If man is made
in God's image...

18:19.228 --> 18:22.492
How do you explain
other beings?

18:25.104 --> 18:29.412
If they exist,
then I-I can't explain

18:29.543 --> 18:33.851
why God would show me
the things I've seen.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.260
- You should get
you some rest.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.740
I'll let you know if we need
anything else, okay?

18:54.698 --> 18:57.179
- Hey, Banks,

18:57.310 --> 18:59.877
part of what goes on here
is experimental aircraft.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.662
- And you know the deal.
It's classified.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.012
- Yeah, and we got
a missing Air Force officer...

19:04.143 --> 19:06.362
- I'm aware.
- On your territory.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.059
So if there's something here
that can explain what happened,

19:08.190 --> 19:09.409
we need to see it.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.062
- Yeah, and I show you
top secret aircraft

19:11.193 --> 19:12.934
without clearance,
we all get sent home.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.025
You understand.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.811
- Course.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.291
You just seemed like someone

19:22.422 --> 19:24.075
willing to bend the rules
to get to the truth.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.604
- He always like this?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.258
- Depends if he
likes you or not.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.918
- I'll bend them,
not break.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.923
Then I'll deny
it ever happened.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.631
I don't want anything
you see here

19:57.761 --> 19:59.720
ending up in the files
of Project Blue Book.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.464
This is "The Flying Wing,"
for obvious reasons.

20:06.379 --> 20:10.470
That's the "Stogie" X-15,
goes Mach 3 on a bad day.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.389
And the "Tailsitter".

20:16.519 --> 20:18.347
Bet you've never seen
anything like that before.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.178
- There's no weapons systems.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.875
- There's no need.

20:25.006 --> 20:28.618
CIA's all about espionage,
not engagement.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.011
- So what happens
when the Soviets

20:30.141 --> 20:31.491
spot your boys
on their radar?

20:31.621 --> 20:34.145
- That's the whole point.
They don't.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.496
This is how we end
the Cold War.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.325
- Or start World War III.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.025
- Thank you, Father.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.475
- I went through
this whole thing

20:59.606 --> 21:01.085
while you were in there.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.305
- You following me now?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.525
- No, just making sure.

21:08.963 --> 21:12.488
I remember what it was like
after Roswell the first time.

21:12.619 --> 21:13.924
Didn't want you putting
another foot

21:14.055 --> 21:15.361
over the ledge again.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.842
- I'm fine, Hugh.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.066
I'm fine.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.241
- Captain.

21:28.591 --> 21:29.679
"Flying Wing."

21:31.594 --> 21:33.901
This underside
remind you of anything?

21:36.425 --> 21:38.035
- It's the exact formation
of the Lubbock Lights.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.170
And that "Stogie."

21:44.128 --> 21:46.043
Tell me that's not identical
to what they described

21:46.174 --> 21:48.785
in the Chiles-Whitted sighting.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.874
These are all
top-secret craft.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.311
If you're not CIA--

21:52.441 --> 21:54.443
- Then every one
of these crafts is a UFO.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.664
- Doc, these planes
might not just explain

21:57.794 --> 21:58.926
Willingham's sighting.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.537
They could explain
every sighting.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.196
- CIA currently has Blue Book

22:08.327 --> 22:10.546
investigating a case
at Area 51.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.069
- Well, if the CIA
wants a piece

22:12.200 --> 22:13.854
of the UFO program,
good luck.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.379
The Eisenhower administration
ain't that big.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.295
- I'm thinking they're trying
to force a choice.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.603
Who's gonna be teacher's pet,
us or them?

22:25.779 --> 22:28.085
- Why don't we
make that choice for Ike?

22:38.879 --> 22:40.489
- You know, I was hoping
we'd have our answer,

22:40.620 --> 22:43.840
but based on what I can see,

22:43.971 --> 22:46.103
there's no craft here
with a downward facing engine

22:46.234 --> 22:49.455
capable of turning desert
into glass.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.983
You think Daniel's
hiding something?

22:56.113 --> 22:58.333
- I think he's showing us
what he wants us to see.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.204
- Yeah, then why invite us
in the first place?

23:00.335 --> 23:02.816
- Well, to do what he just did,
clear the CIA.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.601
Otherwise he's on the hook for
a missing Air Force soldier.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.864
My guess, we never find Miller.

23:07.995 --> 23:08.952
- Captain.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.912
- What's going on?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.807
What the hell happened here?

23:48.818 --> 23:51.212
- This is Dr. Montgomery,
presiding coroner

23:51.342 --> 23:53.344
at the operating facility
0-5-1.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.304
Let the medical record show
this will be

23:56.435 --> 23:58.872
the initial internal exam
of Corporal Miller.

24:08.534 --> 24:11.101
The subject's eyes
have been removed...

24:13.190 --> 24:14.627
As has the tongue.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.109
And there looks to be
an incision of some sort.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.634
Precise, under the chin,

24:21.764 --> 24:24.985
and extending back
to the esophagus and larynx.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.160
- What the hell did this?

24:26.290 --> 24:28.162
- Sternum has been removed

24:28.292 --> 24:31.208
to expose
the inner cavity.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.515
One lung missing,

24:33.646 --> 24:36.562
the heart, the stomach.

24:38.651 --> 24:42.045
All the arteries that were cut,

24:42.176 --> 24:44.265
they've been cauterized closed.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.962
I can't explain how.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.053
You say you found him
in a tree?

24:51.838 --> 24:53.492
Yeah, um...

24:53.622 --> 24:55.145
couldn't something like a--

24:55.276 --> 24:57.017
you know, like a mountain lion
have dragged him up there?

24:57.147 --> 24:58.714
- No animal did this.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.281
- It was something
put him up there.

25:00.411 --> 25:03.589
- Or maybe he was dropped
from above.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.722
- I want everybody out.

25:06.853 --> 25:07.941
- Excuse me,
what the hell is this?

25:08.071 --> 25:09.333
- We're laying claim
to Corporal Miller.

25:09.464 --> 25:10.596
- Under whose jurisdiction?

25:10.726 --> 25:11.988
- The United States Air Force.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.077
Is there a problem?
- Yes, there is, actually.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.688
- Colonel,
I'm Captain Michael Quinn.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.037
U.S. Air Force liaison--

25:17.167 --> 25:18.299
- Project Blue Book.
I'm aware.

25:18.429 --> 25:19.648
Well, this no longer
concerns you.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.998
- No! What are you doing?

25:22.129 --> 25:23.609
It wasn't me!

25:23.739 --> 25:25.132
- Colonel, we need
to finish this autopsy.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.655
- You're making a mistake.
They set me up.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.178
- Sergeant.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.397
- They're saying
that I made it up,

25:29.528 --> 25:30.833
that I killed him.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.095
You know the truth.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.793
You're the only one
that can help me.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.272
- Where are you taking
this man?

25:35.403 --> 25:37.884
- Tell them!
Please, tell them!

25:38.014 --> 25:39.929
Tell them what you saw!

25:40.060 --> 25:41.540
Tell them!

25:43.324 --> 25:45.979
- I was wrong
about the Roswell wreckage.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.111
I thought they sent it
to Groom Lake,

25:48.242 --> 25:50.287
but they didn't.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.767
Read that.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.251
- "When they were done staging
the photos for the press,

25:57.381 --> 25:58.992
"the Air Force
had the debris shipped

25:59.122 --> 26:01.472
from Fort Worth...to Ohio."

26:01.603 --> 26:03.126
- Mm-hmm.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.434
- "To Wright"--
if this is true, then--

26:06.565 --> 26:08.567
- Our own backyard.
I know.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.527
- So what do you do with that?

26:12.658 --> 26:16.139
- I can't do anything,
but you could.

26:18.707 --> 26:22.755
- Evan, I'm happy to pass along
this information to my husband,

26:22.885 --> 26:27.063
but you need to understand
that's the only way this works.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.630
- Who said anything
about your husband?

26:28.761 --> 26:30.197
You've been to the base before.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.895
If you went there again
and got proof...

26:34.723 --> 26:35.855
Remember what we talked about?

26:39.119 --> 26:40.903
- I'm sorry.

26:41.034 --> 26:44.080
I think you have
the wrong impression of me.

26:44.211 --> 26:47.997
Doing something like that,
that--that's not who I am.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.350
- You sure about that?

27:01.315 --> 27:03.534
- So what exactly
would I be looking for?

27:05.580 --> 27:08.583
- Air Force is charging
Willingham with murder.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.628
- How can that be?

27:09.758 --> 27:10.977
There's no way
Willingham did

27:11.107 --> 27:12.456
what we saw
in that autopsy room.

27:12.587 --> 27:13.980
- Look, I told the Colonel
the same thing

27:14.110 --> 27:15.503
with more colorful language.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.896
- We need to talk to him.

27:17.026 --> 27:17.810
- That's not gonna happen.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.249
The colonel told me you've both
been ordered back to Ohio.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.642
- What?

27:23.772 --> 27:25.861
No, we're not done here.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.254
Who do I need to talk to?

27:27.384 --> 27:29.038
- Hey, remember
what Valentine said.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.561
If we're done, we're done.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.085
- He begged for my help
as they were dragging him away.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.260
- We'll have better luck
fighting this back home.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.088
- Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I don't wanna interrupt.

27:35.218 --> 27:38.439
I'm sorry, but I wish
there's more I could do here.

27:38.569 --> 27:41.050
But I imagine this happens
a lot for you two.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.270
Look, in the future, if there's
ever anything I can do to help,

27:43.400 --> 27:44.750
I'm on your side.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.406
Jeep's outside waiting
to take you back.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.407
- All right.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.979
Doc, where you going?

28:00.504 --> 28:02.506
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.683
What are you doing?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.293
- Unless we can present
an alternate theory,

28:06.423 --> 28:08.599
an innocent man's life
is about to be ruined.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.905
Beyond the ridge
where we were earlier,

28:10.036 --> 28:10.950
that's where I'm going.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.647
- Where they shoot on sight?

28:12.778 --> 28:14.170
- Military Jeep--
we'll look like friendlies,

28:14.301 --> 28:16.216
if they even see us.

28:16.346 --> 28:19.045
Now or never, Captain.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.700
- Hey! Hey, hey!

28:31.579 --> 28:33.276
- I figure we've got
about 20 minutes

28:33.407 --> 28:34.974
before they conduct
an aerial search.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.889
We're gonna have to--
- Whoa, did you see that?

28:37.019 --> 28:38.978
- Let's check it out.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.029
Whoa.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.860
Kill the lights.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.040
- What is that?

28:58.171 --> 28:58.998
- I don't know.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.659
- Looks good.
Go ahead. Bring it up.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.184
Got it?

29:14.013 --> 29:15.884
- Are those coyotes?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.494
What are they doing?

29:18.844 --> 29:19.975
Give me that.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.150
- What does that
look like to you?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.286
- That looks like the same
surgical dissection

29:26.416 --> 29:27.417
that happened to Miller.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.987
Willingham didn't do that.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.207
- We're gonna find out who did.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.300
- All right,
follow that truck.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.997
And don't get too close.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.216
Don't wanna tip them off.

29:57.926 --> 30:01.060
Where are you going, truck?

30:08.197 --> 30:10.983
- They can't drive
over that thing.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.462
Why not just go around?

30:17.511 --> 30:20.079
- You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.352
- A hangar inside a mountain?

30:32.482 --> 30:33.744
How do you even engineer that?

30:33.875 --> 30:35.703
- Why would you engineer that?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.487
- I wonder what it's for.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.055
- Well, to keep
secret work hidden.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.275
You think Daniel
knows about this?

30:42.405 --> 30:43.537
- I think what we saw
back there

30:43.667 --> 30:46.061
at the base
was just a cover.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.455
This is the real Area 51.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.243
Where you going?

30:54.374 --> 30:55.766
- I have a camera
in my briefcase.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.420
- Doc, wait.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.862
Doc, get down.
Something's happening.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.125
Come on. Get the shot.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.778
Let's get the hell
out of here, Doc.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.391
Quick.

31:17.005 --> 31:17.919
Shit.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.314
- They see us?

31:21.444 --> 31:24.056
- We're not sticking around
to see if they did.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.318
- Wait, I have to get
the camera.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.928
- Leave it.
- We need proof.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.625
- None of this matters
if we're caught.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.283
- Okay,
we're getting out of here.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.632
- Come on.

31:53.607 --> 31:56.001
- You do realize
what we just saw.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.567
- A base in the side
of a mountain.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.656
- No, no, no, no, the coyotes,
you said so yourself.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.354
Looks just like
what happened to Miller.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.573
That means
Willingham is innocent.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.401
- "Your Honor,
I'd like to call to the stand

32:05.532 --> 32:07.273
"the men in hazmat suits
who disappeared

32:07.403 --> 32:09.275
in the side of a mountain
with an electrical storm."

32:09.405 --> 32:11.799
- An innocent man has just
been charged with murder!

32:13.844 --> 32:15.672
You know,
we have to do something.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.718
- Yes, we get
the hell out of here first.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.502
Already gonna be in deep shit
as soon as we get--

32:19.633 --> 32:21.330
- Captain!

32:21.461 --> 32:23.202
- Ah, great, hold on.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.035
- They've definitely
spotted us.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.302
They're getting closer!

32:36.432 --> 32:37.694
Step on it.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.958
- That's not helping, Doc.

32:40.088 --> 32:42.482
- Captain!

32:42.612 --> 32:43.744
Captain!

32:43.874 --> 32:44.745
- What the hell?

32:47.574 --> 32:49.402
- That's no truck.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.231
- What was that?

32:52.361 --> 32:53.884
- Whatever it was,
it's gone.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.019
We have to get back
to the base.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.246
- There it is again!
Turn around!

33:07.376 --> 33:08.334
Ah!

33:12.164 --> 33:13.730
It's circling around!

33:19.519 --> 33:20.868
Watch out!

33:26.352 --> 33:30.573
Captain, it's coming
straight for us!

33:30.704 --> 33:32.140
- Duck!

33:35.926 --> 33:37.624
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.061
Come on.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.719
- Where'd it go?

34:40.252 --> 34:41.862
- Our own backyard.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.258
Mimi, if you got proof...

34:49.043 --> 34:51.132
- Sorry to interrupt.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.961
- Oh, you didn't interrupt.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.963
I was just taking
a little break.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.922
Trying to decipher Allen's
notes can be a little...

34:59.053 --> 35:00.750
- Exhausting?
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.361 --> 35:05.015
- Well, I was just about
to lock up for the day.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.541
- Right, um, I didn't realize
it had gotten so late.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.673
- You're welcome to come back
and finish when you need.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.674
- Thanks, Faye.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.069
I was just wondering.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.810
I noticed some
of the hangars out there.

35:16.940 --> 35:17.985
They seem to be unmarked.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.378
Do you know why that is?

35:21.510 --> 35:23.904
- I'm sorry.
I'm not at liberty to say.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.428
- Right, it's classified,
of course.

35:26.559 --> 35:29.953
It just--it seems
a little strange, doesn't it?

35:30.084 --> 35:33.479
That kind of secrecy
on a military base?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.596
- Captain.

36:03.726 --> 36:06.076
Hey, Captain.

36:09.428 --> 36:10.907
Where are we?

36:15.651 --> 36:17.871
- A military truck.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.006
What the hell happened to us?

36:23.137 --> 36:24.921
- You can't remember either?

36:28.882 --> 36:31.798
- The last thing I remember
is taking off in that Jeep.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.495
- Me too.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.284
12 hours ago.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.552
- Here they are.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.209
Feet. Step out, please.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.000
- Captain, are we speaking
different languages?

37:00.130 --> 37:01.262
- General.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.438
- What part of
"return to Ohio"

37:03.569 --> 37:04.874
did you not understand?

37:05.005 --> 37:06.528
- Sir, we were headed back--
- It was my fault.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.400
I took off in a Jeep.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.271
The captain, he--he tried to--
he tried to stop me.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.056
- I already lost
a man out here!

37:13.187 --> 37:15.581
And then I get a call
that two more are missing.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.017
What the hell are you doing?

37:17.147 --> 37:19.106
- Well, they're not
being honest with you.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.762
I asked them to survey some
anomalous celestial activity,

37:22.892 --> 37:25.808
something the agency has been
requesting funding for.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.070
So I was out of line.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.507
Should have authorized
with you first.

37:28.637 --> 37:29.986
My apologies.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.773
But they were a big help.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.432
- I want you two
on the next flight out of here.

37:40.562 --> 37:41.433
Do you understand me?

37:41.563 --> 37:42.738
- Yes, sir.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.436
- We'd like to reopen the case

37:44.566 --> 37:46.960
into Sergeant Willingham's
encounter.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.223
- Willingham confessed.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.659
- He--he did what?

37:50.790 --> 37:51.747
- Confessed to murder?

37:53.662 --> 37:55.447
- I want you two
to listen to me,

37:55.577 --> 37:58.232
and listen to me
very carefully.

37:58.363 --> 38:02.497
Corporal Miller's murder
was a tragedy,

38:02.628 --> 38:05.892
and we are not gonna trivialize
that young man's death

38:06.022 --> 38:09.199
with talk of flying
fucking saucers.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.072
You understand me?

38:12.202 --> 38:15.031
Now you will go home,
and I will clean up this shit

38:15.162 --> 38:17.251
because you can't.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.560
Dismissed.

38:26.652 --> 38:27.870
- He told me
about the confession

38:28.001 --> 38:29.350
as soon as he arrived.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.527
Lyin' sack of shit.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.402
- Why would you cover for us
like that?

38:37.532 --> 38:38.794
- 'Cause I'm just like you,
Captain.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.753
Both of you.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.276
I think when people
try to cover up

38:42.407 --> 38:44.887
what's really going on
in this world, we all suffer.

38:46.454 --> 38:47.890
- We went beyond the ridge.

38:50.023 --> 38:53.374
There's another base
inside a mountain.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.811
What is all that?

38:55.942 --> 38:57.900
- I've never been.
I don't know.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.511
- What do you mean
you've never been?

38:59.641 --> 39:00.512
Isn't that part of the CI--

39:00.642 --> 39:01.730
- Anything beyond the ridge,

39:01.861 --> 39:03.645
that belongs to the Air Force.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.608
Look, for the future,
you need anything,

39:09.738 --> 39:13.699
like help finding the truth,
just ask me first.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.408
- Hey, Doc, what happened
to us last night?

39:27.539 --> 39:30.150
- You heard what the man said.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.153
Everything beyond the ridge
belongs to the Air Force.

39:35.677 --> 39:39.333
- I heard that you're
a low-down Yankee liar.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.992
- Hi.
Here's your order.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.386
There you go.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.589
- Shane, look out!

40:19.852 --> 40:23.421
- You'd think Americans would
be tired of Westerns by now.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.858
Same thing every movie.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.513
First sign of trouble,
someone starts shooting.

40:30.819 --> 40:34.083
Was that where you got
the idea to killing Cal?

40:34.214 --> 40:36.695
- I have a new mark,
a better one.

40:36.825 --> 40:41.134
Captain Quinn
from Project Blue Book.

40:41.264 --> 40:44.224
The professor was a dead end,
but our intelligence was right.

40:44.354 --> 40:48.402
The UFO program is a cover
for advanced weapons systems.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.578
Given time, I can gain
more information.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.841
- Our intel
has the CIA cooperating

40:52.972 --> 40:54.582
with Quinn
and Professor Hynek.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.628
The one thing
we don't have is time.

40:56.758 --> 40:57.629
- Two weeks,
that's all I'll need.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.065
- For what?

40:59.195 --> 41:01.459
More photos?
Files?

41:01.589 --> 41:05.288
- To start.
- Hmm.

41:05.419 --> 41:09.249
I think the captain himself
would provide

41:09.379 --> 41:12.426
for a much better source
of information.

41:12.557 --> 41:13.819
Hmm?

41:16.125 --> 41:17.736
You can deliver him to us.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.131
- Kidnapping
an Air Force captain--

41:22.262 --> 41:25.221
- Is something you're
very capable of managing.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.443
And you owe us a body, Mishka.

41:33.012 --> 41:33.969
- How was Nevada?

41:34.100 --> 41:36.102
- Hot.
- Mm.

41:36.232 --> 41:38.278
- We're gonna need
to accelerate our timetable.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.935
- Wait, we scrapped this
years ago and for good reason.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.111
- After what I just saw
in the desert, I'm convinced

41:45.241 --> 41:48.854
the CIA has one goal:
to see us obsolete.

41:48.984 --> 41:50.551
That will make us
indispensable.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.771
- We're taking
a big risk, Hugh.

41:52.901 --> 41:54.642
- Let me tell you something.

41:54.773 --> 41:56.514
I'm tired of these
little skirmishes.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.254
If we're going to war,

41:58.385 --> 42:00.300
let's fire the first
goddamn shot.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.742
- All right, then,
let's go to war.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.224
- 3-1-5-4-5-6-5-3-9...
