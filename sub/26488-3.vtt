WEBVTT

00:22.718 --> 00:24.198
[man coughs]

00:24.241 --> 00:26.504
I know what you're thinking.

00:26.548 --> 00:30.378
Why didn't I just call
to reschedule jury duty?

00:30.421 --> 00:32.728
Well, I meant to,

00:32.771 --> 00:35.078
but turns out
if you wait too long,

00:35.122 --> 00:37.820
you have to appear in person.

00:37.863 --> 00:40.344
I've just been a little busy.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.390
Got behind on the mail.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.521
Understood, ma'am.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.393
I knew I knew you.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.917
You're a Real
Housewife, right?

00:47.960 --> 00:51.268
That's right.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.531
[phone buzzes]

00:53.575 --> 00:54.924
I got to take this.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.752
ELIZABETH:
Still no dismissal yet.

00:56.795 --> 00:59.407
BLAKE:
All right. Uh, I'll just keep

00:59.450 --> 01:00.756
the schedule loose, then.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.932
All right. How are
things going over there?

01:02.975 --> 01:05.848
Um, Undersecretary Albertell
wants to brief you on China.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.806
There are rumors
that a successor to President Li

01:07.850 --> 01:10.592
might be named at the
People's Congress next month.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.550
Fun times. What else?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.204
Prime Minister Moretti's
office called.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.119
They say he knows
you already declined,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.687
but you would be doing Italy
a great honor

01:18.730 --> 01:20.819
by attending Fashion Week.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.518
My answer's the same
as it was three months ago:

01:23.561 --> 01:25.781
thank you for the invite,
and thank you, no.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.174
Are you sure?
Because I just... you know...

01:27.217 --> 01:28.871
Yes, Blake, I'm pretty sure.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.787
There are better ways to promote
the American garment industry

01:31.830 --> 01:33.876
than hobnobbing
with the glitterati in Milan.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.313
Yeah. Yeah,
'cause that sounds terrible.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.315
Yes, I know.
We all share your love

01:38.359 --> 01:40.970
of fancy clothes
and fancy food, Blake.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.841
And wine. Such, such good wine.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.930
Okay, well, wine,
yes. Okay, wine.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.758
But I am not gonna
take a boondoggle

01:46.802 --> 01:49.761
on the taxpayers' dime.[phone beeps]

01:49.805 --> 01:52.416
Oh. Wait, uh, Blake,
I got to take this.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.853
Listen, I'm sorry if jury duty
is causing a headache

01:54.897 --> 01:56.942
with scheduling.
It was just last-minute, so...

01:56.986 --> 01:58.640
Yeah. I... No, I mean,
it's fine. It's all good.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.555
It's fine. Uh, really.
It's good.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.861
[laughs] Liar. Bye.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.124
Hey, babe.Hey.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.387
So, listen,
I decided to take that job.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.955
Oh, that's great. That's great.

02:09.999 --> 02:13.045
In times like these, POTUS could
certainly use an ethics advisor.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.396
Conrad will be lucky
to have you.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.658
The country, too.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.094
Oof. No pressure.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.183
Uh, I just have to stop
by the War College

02:20.227 --> 02:21.837
and resign as acting chair.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.621
Oh, they'll be sad
to see you go.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.710
Yeah, well,
I won't be sad to see them go.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.582
I mean, as colleagues,
I love them.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.627
As people to manage, kill me.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.368
[chuckles][phone beeps]

02:31.412 --> 02:32.848
Ugh, Ms. Popularity today.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.719
All right, I'm gonna take this.
Let me know how it goes.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.025
All right, babe? I love you.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.200
Okay, love you. Bye.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.767
Hello?MIKE:
You know what I hate?

02:38.810 --> 02:39.898
Tourists coming right up
to Gordon

02:39.942 --> 02:41.248
and petting him
without even asking.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.119
It's like, "Get away
from my dog, you rubes."

02:43.163 --> 02:44.860
What can I do you for, Mike?

02:44.903 --> 02:47.558
Oh, right, sorry. Yeah, your
donors are getting restless.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.778
I have donors?

02:49.821 --> 02:51.171
Not for long. See, they're eager

02:51.214 --> 02:52.694
to hop on board
the Bess Express,

02:52.737 --> 02:54.217
but they want to know
where it's going, exactly.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.002
You need to start telling people
what you stand for.

02:57.046 --> 03:00.092
You mean, other than
representing the interests

03:00.136 --> 03:02.443
and values of the United States
around the world?

03:02.486 --> 03:03.574
I'm sorry, but it's

03:03.618 --> 03:05.228
domestic issues
that make voters vote

03:05.272 --> 03:06.577
and donors donate.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.058
School choice
or the environment or whatever.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.800
That's a solid campaign slogan
right there.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.758
No, I'm serious, Bess.
You need to get on this

03:13.802 --> 03:16.283
before Teresa Hurst or
some other potential candidate

03:16.326 --> 03:18.676
hoovers up
all your mega-bundlers.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.461
Mike, have I ever told you
I was running for president?

03:20.504 --> 03:22.114
No, not in so many words.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.987
So until then, I'm not running,
and I don't have donors. Got it?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.858
And I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.817
I have to go participate
in democracy now.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.558
I'm annoying, but I'm not wrong.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.821
Juror number 329.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.780
Yes, Your Honor.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.566
I'm assuming
you would like to be excused,

03:38.609 --> 03:41.046
being that you have
pressing matters to attend to

03:41.090 --> 03:43.353
as our nation's
Secretary of State.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.181
Well, that's correct, sir.
Your Honor.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.008
Wait.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.140
Very well. You're dismissed.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.403
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.883
Or you will be as soon
as you can explain to me

03:51.927 --> 03:55.235
why it took my wife
nearly six weeks

03:55.278 --> 03:57.237
just to have her passport
renewed.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.760
We nearly had to cancel
the whole cruise.

03:58.803 --> 04:01.893
You know how hard it is
to get a ticket to Barbados?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.678
If that judge had gone on
much longer,

04:03.721 --> 04:05.549
they would have had me
being on trial,

04:05.593 --> 04:06.855
I'll tell you.[grunts]

04:06.898 --> 04:07.943
Stand aside, ma'am.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.205
Oh, hey!Oh, I'm sorry.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.598
Are you all right?

04:10.641 --> 04:12.948
Here.Thank you.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.559
Are you okay?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.909
Well, I'm about to get sent
to jail, so no, I'm...

04:17.953 --> 04:19.259
Wait, aren't you, like,

04:19.302 --> 04:21.478
the Secretary of State
or something?

04:22.740 --> 04:25.917
A woman in the waiting room
thought I was a Real Housewife.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.790
For real?For real.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.358
I'm Elizabeth.Katelyn.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.924
Hi, Katelyn.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.187
Here you go.Thank you.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.494
So, uh...

04:37.538 --> 04:40.105
what's going on?Uh...

04:40.149 --> 04:43.718
It's, like, uh, my stupid ex
didn't pay the insurance

04:43.761 --> 04:45.328
on the car,
but I didn't know that

04:45.372 --> 04:47.374
till I got pulled over, so...

04:47.417 --> 04:48.723
Sit down.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.725
Uh, so then they fined me

04:50.768 --> 04:54.032
and suspended my license.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.948
But I have to drive
to get to work, so...

04:56.992 --> 04:58.733
How else am I supposed to pay
the fine?

04:58.776 --> 05:00.343
Well, that makes sense.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.693
So, what happened?
Did you get pulled over again?

05:02.737 --> 05:04.260
That time, I got arrested.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.003
And then the DA-- who's,
like, my age, by the way--

05:08.046 --> 05:09.744
uh, he offered me a deal.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.223
Pay some more fines,

05:11.267 --> 05:15.271
and then I only have to
go to jail for 20 days.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.925
What did your lawyer say?

05:16.968 --> 05:19.275
Take the deal.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.886
She's a public defender, so
she got, like, a million cases.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.932
But I go to jail for 20 days,

05:23.975 --> 05:25.716
I'm definitely
gonna lose my job.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.804
Plus, I'm gonna have a record,

05:26.848 --> 05:30.068
so good luck finding
another one.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.461
I mean, I work hard, okay?

05:31.505 --> 05:33.158
Extra shifts every week

05:33.202 --> 05:34.856
even though it keeps
me away from my kids.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.553
Like, I'm trying to get
my associate's degree.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.338
Like, I know that I messed up,

05:38.381 --> 05:40.731
but, like, what was
I supposed to do?

05:40.775 --> 05:43.430
I think you need
to ask the judge

05:43.473 --> 05:46.520
for more time,
for a continuance.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.739
A continuance? Okay.
Yeah.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.437
And then you can talk
to a lawyer

05:50.480 --> 05:53.701
who actually has the time
to represent you.

05:53.744 --> 05:57.400
This is the number
of a legal aid foundation,

05:57.444 --> 05:59.881
and they represent people
for free.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.797
And give them a call.
Maybe they can help you out.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.276
Okay?Okay. [sniffles]

06:04.320 --> 06:06.017
WOMAN: No, I can't
give you that.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.976
Oh, that's my lawyer.
I got to go.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.024
Here's my card.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.158
If you have any more problems,
just call that number.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.942
Wow. Thanks, Elizabeth.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.423
Good luck, Katelyn.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.642
Continuance!

06:23.905 --> 06:25.472
JAY:
Good news. We just got word

06:25.515 --> 06:27.996
that M-Sec has been excused
from jury duty

06:28.039 --> 06:30.128
and will be back shortly.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.740
Blake has the revised schedule.Yes. It took some work,

06:32.783 --> 06:34.916
but everything
that we had to slide around

06:34.959 --> 06:37.440
has found a new place.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.007
Behold.I don't know whether

06:39.050 --> 06:41.226
to read it or frame it.JAY: It's all here.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.924
Far East desk
for the China briefing,

06:42.967 --> 06:44.665
her sit-down with SecDef,

06:44.708 --> 06:46.014
even the meet and greet
Daisy wanted

06:46.057 --> 06:47.581
with the high school kids
from Houston

06:47.624 --> 06:49.409
who won
the civic engagement contest.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.325
Huh?Yeah, great.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.111
The schedule might be
my finest work.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.070
Okay. Next item. Matt, can you
write a brief statement

06:59.114 --> 07:01.899
about the factory fire
in Emilia-Romagna?Oh, on it.

07:01.943 --> 07:05.250
Uh, latest body count

07:05.294 --> 07:07.122
was up to 15 workers, I think.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.341
Brutal.BLAKE: Is it just me,

07:09.385 --> 07:12.954
or is anyone else surprised that
a fancy brand like Beneventi

07:12.997 --> 07:15.086
has such awful
working conditions?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.697
They probably don't.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.960
They farm a lot of their
work out to subcontractors,

07:19.003 --> 07:20.875
who farm it out again until
you get to sweatshops.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.398
Well, it's probably best

07:22.442 --> 07:25.532
that M-Sec isn't going to Milan
for Fashion Week.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.968
It's not the best look

07:27.011 --> 07:28.230
while they're still
pulling bodies

07:28.273 --> 07:29.492
out of the smoking rubble.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.321
Actually, that is exactly why
I want to go.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.627
Morning, ma'am.
You changed your mind?

07:33.670 --> 07:34.628
Morning.Morning.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.021
Yeah. Look...

07:37.065 --> 07:41.069
a few years ago,
there was near global buy-in

07:41.112 --> 07:42.766
on the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement, right?

07:42.810 --> 07:45.465
Right. All it took was
a horrific factory fire

07:45.508 --> 07:47.031
in Bangladesh.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.643
Frankly, yeah. I mean, that
was the galvanizing moment.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.950
The language in that agreement
held companies responsible

07:52.994 --> 07:55.997
for the practices
of their subcontractors.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.044
If that had been ratified,

08:00.088 --> 08:02.699
it might have prevented
this tragedy.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.005
Yes, but it wasn't,

08:04.048 --> 08:05.267
because the countries
and companies

08:05.310 --> 08:07.312
who benefit from sweatshop labor
just stalled

08:07.356 --> 08:10.054
until the noise blew over
and the world moved on.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.882
Why would this time
be any different?

08:11.926 --> 08:14.450
Because we're gonna make
a bigger noise.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.105
There was no reason for me
to go to Fashion Week before.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.976
But now?

08:19.020 --> 08:20.500
I mean, where better

08:20.543 --> 08:23.198
than the zenith
of the global apparel industry

08:23.241 --> 08:24.852
to say to the other leaders,

08:24.895 --> 08:28.116
"How can we sit here
sipping champagne

08:28.159 --> 08:31.772
"when unfair labor practices
have literally killed workers

08:31.815 --> 08:35.558
just days ago and hours away?"

08:35.602 --> 08:37.604
Do you think that maybe
that'll help us

08:37.647 --> 08:40.041
get the agreement signed?It might.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.869
Great.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.523
Call Prime Minister Moretti.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.394
Tell him the good news,

08:45.437 --> 08:47.265
that I am taking him up
on his invitation.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.050
On it.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.228
♪

09:02.150 --> 09:04.152
Now is not the time
to politicize

09:04.195 --> 09:08.548
the issue
of so-called sweatshop labor

09:08.591 --> 09:11.594
while Italy is still grieving.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.422
And embarrassed.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.600
I share your passion,
but you must understand

09:17.644 --> 09:20.516
this is, uh,
this is not an Italian issue

09:20.560 --> 09:22.126
but rather a Chinese one.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.781
You're saying
the factory was owned

09:24.825 --> 09:27.479
by a Chinese company?

09:27.523 --> 09:31.266
Also, tragically, staffed
by illegal Chinese labor.

09:31.309 --> 09:34.138
Which Beneventi
and other luxury brands exploit

09:34.182 --> 09:37.359
so they can still say
their goods are made in Italy.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.231
Remind me, uh,
was China prepared

09:40.275 --> 09:43.713
to sign on to the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement in the past?

09:43.757 --> 09:45.497
They were less than eager.

09:45.541 --> 09:49.197
Being that they dominate
the global garment industry,

09:49.240 --> 09:52.417
what good would an agreement be
without them, huh?

09:52.461 --> 09:55.638
I would argue that a concerted,
united campaign

09:55.682 --> 09:57.858
by their chief competitors
and markets

09:57.901 --> 10:00.817
could pressure them to join it.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.820
Better we secure
China's participation first

10:03.864 --> 10:07.345
and make a public announcement
at the time.

10:07.389 --> 10:11.393
So in the face of this horrific,
preventable tragedy,

10:11.436 --> 10:14.439
you want to do nothing.

10:14.483 --> 10:19.357
I look forward to visiting
with you in person in Milano.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.664
Until then, Elizabeth.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.448
RUSSELL:
Why make a show

10:23.492 --> 10:25.233
of trying to reform
the textile industry

10:25.276 --> 10:26.887
if the biggest player
won't go along?

10:26.930 --> 10:29.672
Remember, this is bigger
than just textiles.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.500
Close to a trillion dollar
a year industry.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.980
What's bigger than that?

10:33.023 --> 10:34.982
Automotive, tech.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.898
There isn't a sector
of the global economy

10:37.941 --> 10:40.117
where China isn't unfairly

10:40.161 --> 10:42.337
privileging itself.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.731
What do the folks at
Commerce think, Mary?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.863
Elizabeth
is broadly correct, sir.

10:46.907 --> 10:50.084
Chinese government
subsidizes many industries.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.477
Furthermore, they are
unconstrained by labor

10:52.521 --> 10:54.392
and environmental standards.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.224
[clears throat]

11:00.268 --> 11:02.705
Sorry.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.708
Still, uh, getting used
to being back in here.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.318
Carry on, please.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.798
ELIZABETH: The Fair Work
and Trade Agreement

11:08.842 --> 11:12.454
would go a long way toward
addressing those imbalances.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.934
And what's your plan, Bess?

11:13.977 --> 11:17.328
We would start out by filing
a complaint against China

11:17.372 --> 11:19.374
with the World
Trade Organization

11:19.417 --> 11:21.463
about this business
in Italy.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.987
Well, that's a shot across
the bow.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.815
It's a pretty mild one,
given the death toll.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.035
And then you continue
to build pressure on China

11:28.078 --> 11:29.950
to join the agreement
when you get to Milan.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.386
ELIZABETH:
Where Minister Chen

11:31.429 --> 11:35.477
will, apparently, be taking in
some runway shows.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.349
[laughs] Well, I have to admit,

11:38.393 --> 11:40.743
if we're gonna pick a fight
with China,

11:40.787 --> 11:43.137
the optics could be worse.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.401
I like it.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.142
And I think we're right
on this, Bess.

11:48.185 --> 11:51.798
But, uh, this is
touchy stuff, so, uh,

11:51.841 --> 11:54.539
I want the WTO complaint

11:54.583 --> 11:58.413
and your remarks in Italy
to be... measured.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.501
Understand?

11:59.544 --> 12:00.763
Yeah, of course, sir.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
Understood, Mr. President.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.505
ELIZABETH:
Hi, you adorable people.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.506
HENRY:
Hi, babe.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.335
All right, so, what's next?

12:07.378 --> 12:10.468
Uh, well, uh, given
your stance on, um, uh,

12:10.512 --> 12:12.383
fair trade and labor laws,

12:12.427 --> 12:14.472
uh, there's going to be
even more eyes looking at

12:14.516 --> 12:16.170
what you are
wearing in Milan.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.694
Wait. You're going
to Fashion Week?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.392
Yeah, but only to make
an important political point.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.568
Yeah, we're not going
to any of the parties

12:23.612 --> 12:26.484
or those silly runway shows.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.270
We're not, Blake.

12:29.313 --> 12:32.621
But, uh, do get in touch
with the Protocol folks.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.058
See if they can find me
some American designers

12:35.102 --> 12:36.930
with solid labor practices.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.453
ALISON:
Even though the field

12:38.496 --> 12:39.802
that I'm devoting my life to

12:39.846 --> 12:41.761
is apparently silly,
I could give you some names.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.284
Well, I would really
appreciate that,

12:43.327 --> 12:45.242
because when I said "silly,"
I didn't mean the whole thing.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.853
Yeah, wh-when she said "silly,"
she didn't mean

12:46.896 --> 12:48.985
the industry as a whole.You guys don't
have to backpedal.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.814
I meant, just...It just gives me more grist
to prove you wrong

12:51.858 --> 12:53.642
by building my empire.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.688
Ciao, Blake.Ciao.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.168
Well, uh, if there's
nothing else, I will, uh,

12:58.212 --> 12:59.691
say good night. Yep.ELIZABETH: No, thanks, Blake.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.780
HENRY: Good night, Blake.ELIZABETH: Good night.
Night.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.783
[sighs]

13:03.826 --> 13:05.349
Alone at last.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.830
Hi.
[both chuckle]

13:07.874 --> 13:10.050
Ciao, isn't that what
we're all saying now?

13:10.093 --> 13:12.487
So are you officially

13:12.530 --> 13:14.837
the ex-acting department chair?

13:14.881 --> 13:18.014
Oh, you didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

13:18.058 --> 13:21.365
Okay, here's a highlight:
I had to get I.T. to come

13:21.409 --> 13:25.848
and deactivate my
academic user log-in.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.024
What's that?
Exactly.

13:28.068 --> 13:31.158
But in order to deactivate it,
you have to have a password.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.289
Which you never set.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.509
Of course not. So, to sum up,

13:34.552 --> 13:37.425
I had to create
a password and log-in

13:37.468 --> 13:40.384
just so I could deactivate
my password and log out.

13:40.428 --> 13:44.649
Tell me they're teaching
Catch-22at that school.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.478
Tomorrow I have to chair a
Steering Committee meeting

13:47.522 --> 13:49.611
to find my temporary
replacement.

13:49.654 --> 13:53.267
Oh, thank God the War College
doesn't fight any actual wars.

13:53.310 --> 13:56.879
You know, times like these,
the only sensible course

13:56.923 --> 13:59.099
is to go upstairs...

13:59.142 --> 14:02.711
and watch The Great British Baking Show.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.800
You read my mind.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.452
Hey. Got a second?

14:48.496 --> 14:49.889
Come on in.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.544
So, I hear you're sending Nikki
on the trip to Milan.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.633
Yeah, she's earned it.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.983
Why, is that a problem?

14:57.026 --> 14:58.723
No, Nikki's great.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.290
I mean, the trip is kind of

15:00.334 --> 15:01.901
about comms
and messaging, though.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.120
Yeah, and we just both
agreed Nikki's great.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.994
Say what you want
to say, Jay.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.952
You really don't want to go
to Fashion Week?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.519
You, Daisy Grant,

15:11.562 --> 15:13.347
the most fashionable person
in the building?

15:13.390 --> 15:16.567
I just don't want to be apart
from Joanna right now.

15:16.611 --> 15:20.267
I... look, I totally get that.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.746
Leaving Chloe still
kills me every time.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.661
But you always say that your
mom's, like, the greatest

15:23.705 --> 15:26.229
babysitter in the world, so...Look, do you want me to go?

15:26.273 --> 15:27.970
I mean, is that what
you're getting at?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.798
I'm trying to ask
if you're okay.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.669
BLAKE:
Jay.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.280
The secretary's about to do
a call with Minister Chen.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.759
She would like you on it.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.674
That wasn't on the schedule.
Any idea what it's about?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.198
The massive tariffs
China just announced

15:38.241 --> 15:40.374
that are sending
the stock market into free fall.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.680
That's just a guess.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.857
Oh, my God.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.163
ELIZABETH:
Minister Chen,

15:47.207 --> 15:50.079
the complaint the United States
made to the WTO

15:50.123 --> 15:51.646
was measured and appropriate.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.823
These tariffs
China has announced

15:54.866 --> 15:56.346
are a dangerous overreaction.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.392
To the contrary,
Madam Secretary,

15:58.435 --> 16:00.916
your complaint
was a provocative insult.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.570
So insulting, in fact,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.789
that these tariffs
should be considered measured.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.835
Are you threatening more here?

16:06.878 --> 16:10.882
We are cautioning you
to moderate your tone.

16:10.926 --> 16:14.408
The announcement alone has
caused U.S. stocks to plummet.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.714
We can't let that go unanswered.

16:16.758 --> 16:17.977
So now you're threatening us.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.066
Why don't we just talk honestly

16:20.109 --> 16:22.764
and de-escalate
before it comes to that?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.942
What is really going on here,
Ming?

16:28.770 --> 16:31.077
You should have considered
the consequences of your actions

16:31.120 --> 16:33.122
before you so rashly embarked
on them.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.516
And as to who might win
this contest:

16:35.559 --> 16:38.127
look at the trade deficit
between the U.S. and China.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.477
Then ask yourself
who you'd bet on.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.305
Good day, Madam Secretary.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.797
RUSSELL: Well, that
didn't go as planned.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.104
It was a massive overreaction
by China.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.454
Which is exactly what
we wanted to avoid.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.499
I signed off on
the WTO complaint, Russell.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.935
[sighs]

17:03.979 --> 17:06.590
Nevertheless,
we can't let this stand.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.897
My team and I have put together
a preliminary package

17:08.940 --> 17:11.378
of tariffs
for your approval, sir.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.858
It's mostly on textiles
and electronics to start.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.818
But we know how this works:

17:16.861 --> 17:20.039
Once we respond, China
escalates, and so on,

17:20.082 --> 17:22.998
until the both of us go
over an economic cliff,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.739
probably taking the rest
of the world with us.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.089
RUSSELL:
A few months of being locked
out of the Chinese market,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.352
and many of our pork producers,
soybean farmers,

17:29.396 --> 17:31.093
they could go under.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.529
I'm already getting
panicked calls

17:32.573 --> 17:34.096
from their representatives
on the Hill.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.402
We've got to hit back.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.665
ELIZABETH:
We should stick
to our strategy.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.362
I go to Italy to pressure China

17:39.406 --> 17:41.190
on the Fair Work and Trade
Agreement.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.627
That presupposes China can be
reasoned with at this point.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.326
Why do we think they reacted
so strongly in the first place?

17:46.369 --> 17:48.719
People's Congress
is coming up next month.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.157
They're gonna be naming
Li's successor.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.637
Could be contentious.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.335
Maybe they're trying
to project strength

17:55.378 --> 17:56.858
in a time of uncertainty.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.991
They're trying to scare us off
of a conversation

18:00.035 --> 18:01.428
about fair trade
and labor practices

18:01.471 --> 18:02.907
that is long overdue.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.213
DALTON:
Well, I think it's worth

18:04.257 --> 18:06.041
trying to have that conversation
on our terms,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.087
before we get locked
into a trade war

18:08.130 --> 18:10.654
that we might not
be able to stop.
Yes.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.395
But if your trip
doesn't yield results,

18:12.439 --> 18:15.964
we're going to have to hit them
with the tariffs.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.748
I will do my best, sir.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.185
RUSSELL:
Sure.

18:19.228 --> 18:23.102
It's only the global economy
hanging in the balance.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.930
Your motorcade is waiting
outside, ma'am.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.932
Also, a woman named
Katelyn King called.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.499
She said she met you
at court.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did she say?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.850
That legal aid agency
you recommended to her

18:32.894 --> 18:34.852
isn't taking on
any new clients.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.159
She's on a waiting list,
but she won't be able

18:37.203 --> 18:39.379
to see anyone
before her next hearing.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.164
Also, Mike B. called,
or rather he keeps calling.

18:42.208 --> 18:46.081
He said, "It's never too soon,
but it can always be too late."

18:46.125 --> 18:48.083
I, uh, I'll-I'll keep
fending him off.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.738
No. Actually, uh,
I want to talk to him.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.000
Get me Mike B.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.611
[sighs]

18:54.655 --> 18:57.005
KELLY:
Knock, knock.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.615
So, uh, there's someone here
to see you.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.877
What do you mean? Who?

18:59.921 --> 19:01.270
I...Uh, Ms. Grant.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.620
Hi. Anne Gutiérrez.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.015
Oh, uh, Sister Anne,
with the kids from...

19:07.058 --> 19:08.321
Kids from Houston, yes.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.714
May I sit?Uh, should I...?

19:10.758 --> 19:13.064
[clears throat]

19:14.109 --> 19:16.111
Can I ask you
something, Sister?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.722
You can just call me Anne.
Sister can be weird for people.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.507
How did you get past security?

19:20.550 --> 19:22.683
Tell people you're a nun,
they'll let you in anywhere.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.119
I'll keep this brief.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.121
I understand the secretary
has had a change of plans.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.036
Yes, a last-minute trip.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.211
I'm sure someone told you

19:29.255 --> 19:31.082
a cancellation was
always a possibility.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.388
They did, and I understand.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.085
I mean, the kids won't,
but I do.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.218
They'll, of course,
still get the VIP tour.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.567
Yes. I appreciate that.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.657
But they won a nationwide
civic engagement contest

19:40.701 --> 19:43.225
and still had to fund-raise
six months for this trip.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.488
And where they're from,
that's not easy.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.273
So if they can't meet
the secretary,

19:47.316 --> 19:49.318
they deserve to meet someone.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.581
Well, I'll check with
the undersecretary.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.104
How about you?

19:53.148 --> 19:55.542
Me? Why?

19:55.585 --> 19:57.283
You're on TV. You're the face
of this department.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.545
Why not you?

19:58.588 --> 20:01.678
Look, I, um,
I'm pretty busy, so...

20:01.722 --> 20:04.159
So you don't have time to talk
to 15 black and brown kids

20:04.203 --> 20:06.509
who just took the first plane
ride of their lives to get here.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.119
Or maybe they wouldn't want
to hear

20:08.163 --> 20:10.252
what I have to say right now,
so maybe you should

20:10.296 --> 20:12.167
just stop bugging me
about it, okay, Sister?

20:14.082 --> 20:15.823
What would you say to them?

20:18.826 --> 20:21.045
Look, um,
I know these kids hearing

20:21.089 --> 20:23.874
from someone like me matters,
believe me.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.137
But you're kind of
springing this on me.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.751
So here's the thing.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.362
I was supposed to go
with the secretary to Italy,

20:33.406 --> 20:35.190
but I didn't want to.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.540
I have a daughter.
She's 15 months old.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.935
My parents, they could have
babysat, no problem.

20:40.978 --> 20:45.200
Lately, every time she is out
of my sight, I get nervous.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.420
I get up in the night
to check on her,

20:47.463 --> 20:49.944
like, all the time.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.337
And part of it's to do
with the attack.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.817
I mean, a bunch
of white guys

20:53.861 --> 20:56.951
were so enraged by the prospect
of making space

20:56.994 --> 20:59.083
for someone like my daughter,
like me,

20:59.127 --> 21:02.304
that they would literally rather
blow up the White House,

21:02.348 --> 21:04.741
rather destroy the country
than share it.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.308
And, also,
I can give you the names

21:06.352 --> 21:08.092
of at least five unarmed
black people

21:08.136 --> 21:10.617
who've been killed by the police
in the last six months.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.315
Just driving along, and
then you get pulled over,

21:13.359 --> 21:14.751
and boom, that's it.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.406
What if my mom or dad
is driving Joanna

21:17.450 --> 21:19.974
from a play group
or music class,

21:20.017 --> 21:22.281
and then they get pulled over,
and then...

21:26.372 --> 21:29.070
I'm sorry.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.202
See what I mean?

21:31.246 --> 21:33.292
I'm not very inspiring.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.252
Look, I...

21:37.296 --> 21:39.776
I'm not trying
to be selfish.

21:39.820 --> 21:44.215
I just truly don't trust myself
not to kill someone's dreams.

21:44.259 --> 21:48.307
I know how you feel, and I wish
I had more answers for you.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.830
I worry about my kids every day.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.353
This is why I was so invested

21:51.397 --> 21:53.312
in them winning that contest,
coming here.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.140
So they could at least feel
their country sees them.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.318
That someone even knows
they have dreams.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.888
I'll see what I can do, okay?

22:06.368 --> 22:08.849
Okay. I appreciate that.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.939
Now, I have taken up
enough of your time.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.723
Thanks, Anne.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.204
I'm sorry I said that
you were bugging me.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.162
Oh, don't be, hon.

22:18.206 --> 22:21.209
That's what I do. I bug people
for the Lord. Bye, now.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.387
CHEN:
"'It was much pleasanter
at home,'

22:25.431 --> 22:27.346
"thought poor Alice,

22:27.389 --> 22:29.739
"'when one wasn't always
growing larger and smaller,

22:29.783 --> 22:34.527
and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits.'"

22:34.570 --> 22:37.312
[speaking Chinese]

22:37.356 --> 22:39.358
English, please.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.622
Will Alice get home?

22:42.665 --> 22:45.320
Very good.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.062
We'll have to keep reading
to find out.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.237
Good night, Ai.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.370
Good night, Daddy.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.247
Bravissima.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.264
ELIZABETH:
Sign on to the Fair Work

23:16.307 --> 23:18.745
and Trade Agreement.
Talk about signing on.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.269
And the president will
keep our side in line.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.836
I can't do that right now.

23:22.879 --> 23:26.535
Well, that is
extremely unfortunate.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.537
Several years ago, Elizabeth,

23:28.581 --> 23:31.453
we bumped into each other
at a bar in Lagos.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.195
Do you remember
what you said to me that night?

23:34.238 --> 23:36.415
Something like,

23:36.458 --> 23:38.373
"Imagine what we could do
if we worked together."

23:38.417 --> 23:42.072
But you see how these tariffs
are the opposite of that, right?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.683
I do.

23:43.726 --> 23:47.164
But many things will become
clear in the next few days.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.731
Things that could
positively

23:48.775 --> 23:51.038
impact the relationship
between our two countries

23:51.081 --> 23:53.170
for years to come.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.175
You're on the short list
to become president.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.308
As are you.

24:00.351 --> 24:03.137
Don't waste time
denying it.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.966
Instead,
think of what might be possible,

24:06.009 --> 24:07.881
given our relationship.

24:07.924 --> 24:12.451
But I warn you, that future
will be at risk if you continue

24:12.494 --> 24:14.931
to embarrass China over
our trade and labor practices.

24:14.975 --> 24:19.501
So, please,
for a few more crucial days,

24:19.545 --> 24:21.808
proceed with discretion.

24:29.555 --> 24:33.733
BAILIFF: Next Case: 11578-A,
The People versus Katelyn King.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.474
JUDGE BRICKMAN:
Good morning, Ms. King.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.214
Before I enumerate the charges

24:37.258 --> 24:40.217
against you, I have to ask:
do you have counsel today?

24:40.261 --> 24:43.612
I-I... I-I think so,
Your Honor.

24:43.656 --> 24:47.137
Your Honor, it's a
yes-or-no question.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.313
If the defendant fired her
court-appointed counsel,

24:49.357 --> 24:51.490
then she's elected
to represent herself.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.753
The People would like
to know how she pleads.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.537
I'm afraid
the People have a point.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.539
What are we doing here,
Ms. King?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.628
MIKE: Apologies for my
tardiness, Your Honor.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.630
Michael Barnow for the defense.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.590
Mr. Barnow, this is, uh,
indeed a surprise.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.330
For all of us.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.115
Life is full of them,
Your Honor.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.290
Hi.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.685
May I remind the court that
despite these theatrics,

25:12.728 --> 25:15.296
we're still waiting to simply
hear how the defendant pleads.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.603
I understand
that the prosecution

25:17.646 --> 25:19.387
has offered a plea bargain:

25:19.430 --> 25:21.824
20 days in jail
and a fine of $2,000.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.696
Does the defense accept
that offer?

25:23.739 --> 25:26.481
We do not. Indeed, the fact
that the People are asking

25:26.525 --> 25:28.918
for jail time in this case
is absurd and cruel.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.659
Will the court indulge me
a moment?

25:30.703 --> 25:32.879
PICKFORD:
Objection. This plea was
worked out with the defendant's

25:32.922 --> 25:37.013
previous counsel.A public defender who,
in her haste to close a file,

25:37.057 --> 25:38.928
failed to take even
basic steps necessary

25:38.972 --> 25:40.321
to my client's defense.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.714
Which steps, Mr. Barnow?

25:41.757 --> 25:43.585
Taking a statement from
Ms. King's ex-husband,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.587
who would have averred
he was responsible

25:45.631 --> 25:48.068
for failing to pay insurance
on the car in the first place.

25:48.111 --> 25:51.550
Advising her that she could fill
out a simple form at the DMV

25:51.593 --> 25:53.900
allowing her to drive to work
on a suspended license.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.597
Wait. You can?
Here.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
Furthermore, Your Honor,
Ms. King is a hardworking

25:57.643 --> 26:00.167
single mother-- with no
priors, by the way.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.821
The only guilty party
in this courtroom

26:01.864 --> 26:03.649
is an overzealous prosecutor,

26:03.692 --> 26:06.434
who'll be lucky if I don't
call his boss Larry Broznahan

26:06.477 --> 26:08.131
and tell him how terribly

26:08.175 --> 26:09.785
the People are being
misrepresented today.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.613
Objection!
Sustained.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.615
Grandstanding aside,

26:13.659 --> 26:16.313
he has a point, counselor.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.620
Why are you pushing
for jail time here?

26:18.664 --> 26:20.535
Well, this is...You know what?
You're not.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.624
Given this information,
I'm going to recommend

26:22.668 --> 26:26.541
that this case be settled
with a reduced fee of $500.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.369
Is that acceptable
to both parties?

26:28.412 --> 26:31.938
Mm... Mr. Pickford's handling of
this case has been so egregious,

26:31.981 --> 26:34.636
I have half a mind to review
all of his previous ones

26:34.680 --> 26:36.116
before agreeing to anything.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.988
We recommend a fine
of $250, Your Honor.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.424
And we accept.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.513
JUDGE BRICKMAN:
Wonderful news.
Ms. King is ordered

26:42.557 --> 26:45.647
to pay a fine of $250
and to return a completed form

26:45.691 --> 26:47.518
to the DMV within 30 days.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.738
[gavel bangs]Next case.

26:49.782 --> 26:53.046
That's right.
Run, you little twerp.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.613
Wait. Is that it?
That's it.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.659
Wait. Thank you so much,
um, but I don't have 250 bucks.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.706
Oh, I do. We'll work it out.
Listen, I got to run.

27:00.749 --> 27:01.968
I parked in a
15-minute spot.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.623
Who are you?

27:04.666 --> 27:08.714
Mostly an overpaid
D.C. hack,

27:08.757 --> 27:12.674
but today, an avenging
angel of justice.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.853
Wait a minute.
We're a few hours away

27:17.897 --> 27:21.030
from issuing a joint
statement in this very room,

27:21.074 --> 27:23.946
pledging our support of the
Fair Work and Trade Agreement.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.688
Are you telling me
the EU is backing out?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.864
Of course we agree
with its principles,

27:28.908 --> 27:31.824
but, uh, there is no point
in alienating the Chinese

27:31.867 --> 27:35.871
over an agreement
they will never join.

27:35.915 --> 27:38.831
I understand
it might be easier

27:38.874 --> 27:42.835
to hope that they'll choose to
change on their own somehow.

27:44.314 --> 27:47.622
Or we could go ahead
and do the hard work

27:47.666 --> 27:50.799
of trying to shape a world
that works better for everyone.

27:50.843 --> 27:54.890
Inspirational,
but we have an old saying.

27:54.934 --> 27:57.632
"Al piu potente ceda il piu prudente."

27:57.676 --> 27:59.634
Roughly translated, it means,

27:59.678 --> 28:03.290
"It is better to bow
than to break."

28:03.333 --> 28:07.729
You know what
Ben Franklin once said?

28:07.773 --> 28:12.691
"If we do not hang together, we
shall surely hang separately."

28:14.562 --> 28:16.259
I'll tell you what.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.522
You and your colleagues come
to the joint statement.

28:18.566 --> 28:19.785
You leave China to me.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.047
DAISY:
The Seventh Floor

28:21.090 --> 28:23.745
is the nerve center
of the State Department,

28:23.789 --> 28:27.314
where the secretary and her
senior staff have their offices.

28:27.357 --> 28:30.709
I know you all were hoping
to meet the secretary,

28:30.752 --> 28:34.582
but unfortunately,
she is out of the country.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.802
[students sighing, groaning]

28:36.845 --> 28:38.064
I know, I know.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.761
But before we go into
the secretary's office,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.632
I want you to take
a look around.

28:41.676 --> 28:44.244
Six months ago,
when Sister Anne told you,

28:44.287 --> 28:45.724
"We're going
to Washington, D.C.,

28:45.767 --> 28:47.813
and we're going
to visit the State Department,"

28:47.856 --> 28:49.771
you probably said she was crazy.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.338
Not "probably said."
That's what they said.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.600
[laughter]

28:52.643 --> 28:55.037
But six months later,
here you are.

28:55.081 --> 28:58.301
I want you to take a moment
to savor your achievement.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.347
Because real talk?

29:01.827 --> 29:05.526
It doesn't get any easier
from here.

29:05.569 --> 29:09.878
You know better than most
that sometimes this world,

29:09.922 --> 29:13.795
this country is not going
to be fair.

29:13.839 --> 29:16.537
You won't always be seen
for the creative,

29:16.580 --> 29:19.453
enthusiastic young men
and women that you are.

29:19.496 --> 29:23.936
So on the bad days,
when you're tempted to give up,

29:23.979 --> 29:25.851
you're going to have to find

29:25.894 --> 29:30.116
that belief in yourself,
because you can make it.

29:30.159 --> 29:33.772
I know, because I made it,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.774
and you all are
definitely smarter than me,

29:35.817 --> 29:37.471
'cause I read your essays.

29:37.514 --> 29:38.864
[laughter]

29:38.907 --> 29:40.691
So, remember the good days.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.825
And you guys, I promise you,
today is one of them.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.132
Now follow me.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.660
Come in.

29:52.703 --> 29:55.141
[excited, indistinct chatter]

29:57.230 --> 29:59.798
I know you all were hoping
to meet Secretary McCord,

29:59.841 --> 30:02.278
but, uh, I'll just have to do.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.890
Hi.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.283
You're lucky the president
wanted a change of scenery.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.286
You owe me big-time.Do I, though?

30:10.330 --> 30:12.680
And, uh, do you know what
you want to study in college?

30:12.723 --> 30:14.725
Engineering, sir.Engineering. Excellent.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.858
I think it's me
that owes you.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.338
No, I think it's
the opposite.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.992
I'm glad you came
and bugged me.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.864
It's actually
the best job in the world.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.605
But then what, Anne?

30:24.648 --> 30:27.826
Get beaten down by the world,
get inspired by kids,

30:27.869 --> 30:30.654
until you get beaten
down again, and repeat?

30:30.698 --> 30:33.744
Pretty much. Why do you think
I work with them?

30:35.137 --> 30:38.097
Look, you do whatever
small thing you can every day

30:38.140 --> 30:40.795
on the side of hope and justice,
just like you did today.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.842
I'm not saying it's easy,
but then,

30:43.885 --> 30:46.714
I get to witness the radical,
transformative miracle

30:46.757 --> 30:50.022
of God's love "on the regular,"
as the kids like to say.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.328
DALTON: I want to meet this
incredible teacher of yours.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.069
Where is Sister Anne?

30:54.113 --> 30:57.029
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go meet the president.Absolutely.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.031
[chuckling]: Hey, get in here.Come on!

30:59.074 --> 31:00.771
Nice to meet you.You, uh,

31:00.815 --> 31:02.599
should be very proud
of these young people.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.210
SISTER ANNE:
Extremely.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.473
MAN:
Secretary McCord, this may seem
like a trivial question,

31:06.516 --> 31:08.214
but given your recent remarks,
perhaps it's not.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.651
Can you tell me who made the
clothes you're wearing today?

31:10.694 --> 31:12.566
Oh. Absolutely.

31:12.609 --> 31:13.959
The designer is a young woman,

31:14.002 --> 31:16.526
Rebecca Flores of Brooklyn,
New York, of course.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.050
And this suit

31:18.093 --> 31:20.617
is 100% union and American made.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.142
In fact,
it was actually constructed

31:23.185 --> 31:27.407
by Maria Ortiz, Juan Carlos
Carrillo and Carla Macias.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.930
And that's a great question,

31:28.974 --> 31:31.454
and one that we could all
start asking more often.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.803
Thank you. Excuse me.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.544
[reporters clamoring]

31:34.588 --> 31:37.417
My colleagues and I
are here today

31:37.460 --> 31:40.289
to draw attention
to the fact that,

31:40.333 --> 31:45.294
while fashion is an exciting
and economically vital industry,

31:45.338 --> 31:47.557
the manufacture of textiles

31:47.601 --> 31:50.952
all too often comes
at great human cost.

31:50.996 --> 31:54.347
We just saw those consequences
earlier this week

31:54.390 --> 31:56.566
in Emilia-Romagna.

31:56.610 --> 32:00.005
That is why
we are redoubling our effort

32:00.048 --> 32:03.051
to revive the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement.

32:03.095 --> 32:06.402
Unfortunately,
one important voice

32:06.446 --> 32:10.232
in this conversation
has chosen not to join us.

32:10.276 --> 32:13.888
China prides itself
on its dominance

32:13.932 --> 32:18.110
of the global textile industry
and many others.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.982
But when it comes
to taking responsibility

32:21.026 --> 32:23.332
for their working conditions,

32:23.376 --> 32:26.988
they're nowhere to be found.[cameras clicking]

32:27.032 --> 32:31.166
If China wants to be a leader
in the 21st century,

32:31.210 --> 32:35.518
it's time to come join us
and start acting like one.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.259
Thank you.[reporters clamoring]

33:21.738 --> 33:23.740
[phone ringing]

33:34.577 --> 33:37.058
Ming, how are you?I'll be brief.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.800
China wishes no further
unwarranted attention

33:39.843 --> 33:41.106
on its labor conditions.

33:41.149 --> 33:44.196
If that is understood,

33:44.239 --> 33:46.067
we are prepared to engage

33:46.111 --> 33:48.069
on the subject of the Fair
Work and Trade Agreement.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.245
I look forward
to working with you.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.551
Agreed.There will have to be

33:51.594 --> 33:53.727
modifications to the language,
of course.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.250
Significant modifications.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.078
So long as they don't undermine

33:57.122 --> 34:00.081
the larger point
of the agreement.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.780
The point is we're talking now.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.348
There's no more need for stunts.

34:06.392 --> 34:09.438
Like the tariffs
you hit us with?

34:09.482 --> 34:13.007
I was referring
to something else.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.011
But now that you
bring them up,

34:17.055 --> 34:18.534
it has been decided,

34:18.578 --> 34:21.189
now that it's clear
China's economic might

34:21.233 --> 34:24.236
is not to be questioned,
that the tariffs

34:24.279 --> 34:28.066
have served their purpose
and will be rescinded.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.939
The United States
appreciates that

34:31.982 --> 34:36.813
and in return will stand down
its own planned sanctions.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.861
Very well, then.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.906
Good day, Madam Secretary.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.344
Ming.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.564
I've met a lot of heads
of state in this job.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.350
You would have made a fine one,

34:51.393 --> 34:55.267
and I'm really sorry.

34:55.310 --> 34:59.314
More so if my stunt
played any role in it.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.102
That's kind of you.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.106
But I suspect what happened

35:08.149 --> 35:11.196
was what was always
going to happen.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.547
Nevertheless,

35:14.590 --> 35:17.115
for both our countries' sake,

35:17.158 --> 35:20.292
I hope your luck proves
to be better than mine.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.468
[chuckles softly]

35:26.211 --> 35:28.604
Until next time, Elizabeth.

35:28.648 --> 35:31.216
Until then, Ming.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.919
HENRY: The next thing I know,
I'm in a meeting

35:38.962 --> 35:41.356
to decide who gets
my parking space.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.924
My hand to God. I just
walked out of there.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.534
I said, "I'm trying
to serve my country.

35:45.578 --> 35:47.188
You guys figure it out."

35:47.232 --> 35:50.322
I think I gave away too much
to get China to the table.

35:50.365 --> 35:53.281
They'll be committing
to unprecedented worker,

35:53.325 --> 35:54.369
environmental and
trade protections.

35:54.413 --> 35:56.023
And if they
break the rules,

35:56.066 --> 35:57.894
hey, at least there are rules.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.287
That's huge.

35:59.331 --> 36:00.419
Will it bring back

36:00.462 --> 36:02.551
those poor women
that died in the fire

36:02.595 --> 36:04.074
or prevent the next one?

36:04.118 --> 36:06.860
I doubt it.Babe, politics is the art
of the possible.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.383
You don't have a magic wand.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.298
Well, that's just it.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.953
I feel like I am always...

36:12.996 --> 36:15.651
almost solving the problems.

36:15.695 --> 36:18.654
Temporarily solving them or...

36:18.698 --> 36:21.179
solving the little ones.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.182
Like, I-I'm glad that Mike B.

36:24.225 --> 36:27.359
was able to get that poor
woman Katelyn's case dropped.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.230
Uh-huh. And I bet she is, too.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.101
Wasn't a little problem to her.Yeah.

36:31.145 --> 36:34.888
But what if I hadn't
walked down that hallway?

36:34.931 --> 36:37.499
She'd probably be
in jail tonight.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.414
Separated from her kids

36:39.458 --> 36:43.984
for no reason other
than bad luck.

36:44.027 --> 36:47.074
That's not the way the system
is supposed to work, Henry.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.206
Sure isn't.

36:50.295 --> 36:54.473
What I have
isn't a magic wand at all.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.866
[sighs]

36:56.910 --> 37:01.523
It's something
much more imprecise...

37:01.567 --> 37:04.613
and inefficient.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.572
It's like a magic...

37:06.615 --> 37:07.964
Rake?

37:08.008 --> 37:10.358
Yes, exactly.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.231
A... a magic rake.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.233
Half the time,
it's not even the right tool.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.758
Half? That's being
pretty generous to rakes.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.630
Is this what the presidency
would be like?

37:21.674 --> 37:26.287
Just trying to level
the playing field,

37:26.331 --> 37:29.899
stitch shattered lives
back together with a magic rake?

37:29.943 --> 37:34.339
All day, every day
for four...

37:34.382 --> 37:36.384
maybe eight years.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.561
I love you.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.871
Well, that's sobering.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.875
I love you, too.

37:55.882 --> 37:59.146
And whosoever shall wield
the magic rake

37:59.189 --> 38:01.191
will be pure of heart.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.325
And really creative,

38:04.369 --> 38:06.022
because rakes are only good[laughs]

38:06.066 --> 38:09.069
for, like, one job.

38:11.376 --> 38:14.335
Heya.Come on in.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.816
First of all,
I wanted to thank you

38:16.859 --> 38:18.513
for your help with Katelyn.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.386
Who?Katelyn King.

38:22.735 --> 38:25.694
Mike, the woman you saved
from going to jail?

38:25.738 --> 38:28.741
Right! Right. No, that
was fun, actually.Hey, yes. Okay.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.483
Watching that little creep
of a prosecutor go all pale

38:31.526 --> 38:34.050
as I crushed his crummy case
in my mighty fist of truth.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.313
God, I miss court.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.271
Take a seat.
I want to tell you something.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.362
I am gonna run for president.Yes!

38:41.406 --> 38:43.364
That is what I'm talking about.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.366
Oh, God.Yeah.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.455
I mean, it's good to
finally hear you say it.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.631
That's important. But tell
me something I don't know.It is.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.067
You know what? You know what?Well, I...

38:51.111 --> 38:52.373
I will tell you something
you don't know.Okay.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.983
You have it in you

38:54.027 --> 38:56.246
to be one of the most
consequential presidents

38:56.290 --> 38:58.074
in our history.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.642
Like, Mount Rushmore great.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.384
Well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.733
No pun intended.No.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.431
Oh. Okay.Let's. Let's get
ahead of ourselves,

39:06.474 --> 39:08.389
because you need to get
serious about this right away.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.739
Issues, advisors,
donors. It's time.I hear you. I hear you.

39:10.783 --> 39:13.307
In fact,
you-you mentioned

39:13.351 --> 39:14.526
my signature domestic issue.Yes.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.484
I think I found it.Great. What is it? Jobs?

39:16.528 --> 39:18.530
Can't go wrong with jobs.
Who doesn't love jobs?

39:18.573 --> 39:19.748
Everybody wins with jobs.

39:19.792 --> 39:23.273
Uh, criminal justice reform.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.363
Huh.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.496
[chuckles]:
I know.I mean, that's... cool,

39:28.540 --> 39:31.325
but, uh, maybe... maybe
not the signature issue?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.719
Maybe...
Every day,
I condemn autocracies

39:33.762 --> 39:37.375
for unjustly imprisoning
their own people.

39:37.418 --> 39:41.379
But we are locking up more
of our own citizens per capita

39:41.422 --> 39:43.772
than any other country
on Earth.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.426
Yeah...And you know why?

39:45.470 --> 39:49.909
It's just, like, in many cases,
like what we saw with Katelyn.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.476
Who's Katelyn?The woman you helped, Mike.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.521
Oh, yeah. No, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.523
Because we're
criminalizing poverty.

39:55.567 --> 40:00.180
And it comes at not just
great economic cost,

40:00.223 --> 40:04.619
but great moral cost
to us as a nation.

40:04.663 --> 40:09.015
And I, for one,
mean to do something about it.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.321
So here's my big idea,

40:11.365 --> 40:13.715
my reason for running.

40:13.759 --> 40:17.197
I want to lift people up.

40:18.807 --> 40:22.245
At home and around the world.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.423
And that's what
I want to use my...

40:25.466 --> 40:28.426
you know, magic rake for.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.253
I'm sorry, your magic what?

40:30.297 --> 40:32.517
Late-night conversation
with Henry.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.823
Don't worry about it.But how do you lift
people with a rake?

40:34.867 --> 40:37.565
Do you turn it up...
And what makes it magic?It's not about the rake.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.741
Is it, like, larger? Okay.You need to forget
about the rake. Mike.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.830
I can't forget
about the rake.Do.

40:41.874 --> 40:44.267
[sighs]

40:44.311 --> 40:46.269
So, should I start
making calls?

40:46.313 --> 40:49.621
No. Like I said, it's too soon.

40:49.664 --> 40:52.275
But if you want
your rich friends

40:52.319 --> 40:54.321
to show their support for me,

40:54.364 --> 40:56.976
you can ask them
to donate to the legal aid fund

40:57.019 --> 40:58.281
that couldn't take on
Katelyn's case.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.893
Clearly, they need
the resources.Yes.

41:00.936 --> 41:03.025
Absolutely. But maybe
also a super PAC.

41:03.069 --> 41:06.202
Thanks, Mike.
It's been clarifying.
