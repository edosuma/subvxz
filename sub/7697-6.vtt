02:01.412 --> 02:02.538
Hey!

02:03.205 --> 02:04.749
Who's in here?

02:22.516 --> 02:24.560
This is the fourth
identical poisoning this month.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.520
We've kept the victims alive so far,

02:26.604 --> 02:28.689
but we're not even sure
what kind of poison it is.

02:29.106 --> 02:31.192
Why don't you ask the woman who made it?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.319
Poison Ivy.

02:33.569 --> 02:35.738
She was our first guess,
but we ruled her out.

02:36.113 --> 02:38.240
- You mean she's am In Arkham?
- No.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.576
She completed her rehabilitation
six months ago.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.994
The board gave her a clean bill.

02:42.328 --> 02:46.165
And now, wealthy bachelors are being
struck down by an unknown toxin.

02:46.582 --> 02:48.334
Sounds like Ivy's M0 to me.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.878
I don't think she's interested
in single men anymore.

02:51.253 --> 02:52.254
Hmm?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.506
You haven't heard?

02:53.589 --> 02:55.883
Not only did Pamela Isley
clean herself up,

02:56.092 --> 02:57.593
she also got married.

03:10.731 --> 03:12.358
Hi. Come on in.

03:14.276 --> 03:15.569
Thank you, Ms. Isley.

03:15.861 --> 03:19.281
My pleasure, Commissioner,
though it's Carlyle now.

03:19.573 --> 03:21.575
Mrs. Pamela Lillian Carlyle.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.621
This is my husband, Steven.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.791
Hello, Commissioner.
Nice to see you again.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.793
Dr. Carlyle is our liaison

03:30.876 --> 03:32.878
between the board at Arkham
and the police department.

03:33.295 --> 03:36.549
You also teach classes
on criminal psychology at Gotham State.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.217
I've read some of your works.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.760
They were very impressive.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.262
Thank you.

03:41.595 --> 03:44.724
But I get the feeling
this isn't a social call.

03:44.890 --> 03:48.060
Someone is poisoning and robbing
wealthy young men.

03:48.602 --> 03:52.648
As painful as it sounds,
all clues point to your wife.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.110
- That's outrageous! Pamela hasn't-
- Darling, please.

03:57.319 --> 03:59.780
Batman, I don't doubt
that I was your first,

03:59.864 --> 04:01.532
and probably only suspect.

04:02.074 --> 04:05.494
Over the years, you and I
have had a rather intense relationship.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.831
But that's all in the past, believe me.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.834
I look back on what I was,
and I shudder.

04:12.376 --> 04:15.379
Locked away in Arkham
with the obsessed and the insane

04:15.463 --> 04:18.090
and me just as lost as any of them.

04:18.924 --> 04:20.801
And then I met Steven.

04:21.093 --> 04:24.430
His love and guidance
brought me into the light again.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.391
Mom, Dad,
the Batmobile's outside!

04:27.475 --> 04:29.310
It is, it is! We saw it!

04:30.770 --> 04:31.812
Whoa!

04:32.688 --> 04:35.524
Cool. Batman's really here!

04:37.943 --> 04:40.613
Mommy, you didn't tell us
you know Batman.

04:42.239 --> 04:43.991
That was a long time ago, sweetie.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.869
These are my boys, Chris and Kelly.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.914
- Hi.
- Can we ride in your car?

04:50.164 --> 04:52.875
Come on, guys.
Let's leave Mom alone for a minute.

04:55.669 --> 04:57.046
Bye, Batman.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.799
I never thought about
having kids before.

05:00.716 --> 05:01.842
I can't.

05:02.009 --> 05:05.054
Nature's little tradeoff
for my hyper immune system.

05:06.555 --> 05:10.559
And yet, when I met Steven's boys,
something inside me just melted.

05:11.143 --> 05:12.812
I guess there really does come a time

05:12.895 --> 05:15.189
when a woman wants
something more in her life.

05:15.439 --> 05:17.191
At least this woman does.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.652
Steven doesn't care about my past.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.571
He and the boys accept me
for who I am now.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.866
I don't know who has been duplicating
my old crimes,

05:25.991 --> 05:29.870
but I can assure you, gentlemen,
Poison Ivy is dead.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.674
Don't tell me the great Dick Grayson
is spending the night in for a change?

05:42.049 --> 05:43.926
Hey, we got finals coming up.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.596
But what about those cheerleaders
I always see chasing you around?

05:47.888 --> 05:50.182
Can't they help you pass calculus?

05:50.266 --> 05:53.269
- That's not the mson I asked you over.
- Oh. no?

05:53.561 --> 05:56.730
No. I just thought it would be fun
to get together

05:56.814 --> 06:00.317
and study and talk and, um...

06:00.651 --> 06:01.735
And?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.333
Hello?

06:16.625 --> 06:17.960
It's me.

06:18.335 --> 06:19.753
Oh, hi.

06:20.754 --> 06:22.715
I wasn't expecting to hear
from you tonight.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.758
I'd better go.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.135
Uh...

06:26.385 --> 06:27.553
Do you have company?

06:29.096 --> 06:30.764
Not anymore.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.516
Sorry.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.562
I need you to check on a teacher
there at GSU. Steven Carlyle.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.231
I was in his class last year. Nice guy.

06:40.107 --> 06:42.359
- He's not in trouble, is he?
- Possibly.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.486
See what you can find on him.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.239
Family history,
places he's worked, anything.

06:47.489 --> 06:49.658
Right. I'll check back with you later.

06:51.535 --> 06:52.620
Cindy?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.985
I'm so sorry.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.365
It's all my fault.
If only I hadn't left him.

07:29.698 --> 07:30.824
It's all right.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.912
I had just gone back to my room
when I heard a loud crash.

07:34.995 --> 07:38.040
I ran down here, and Dick was gone.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.750
And you saw no one
leaving the dorm?

07:40.209 --> 07:41.210
No-

07:42.378 --> 07:44.672
I don't think Dick
is the only victim, Mr. Wayne.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.007
You mean they kidnapped him
to get at me.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.803
It fits the pattern. Wealthy single men,
all targets of robberies.

07:50.886 --> 07:54.181
Only, in your case, you have something
more valuable to hold for ransom.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.559
My ward.

08:24.169 --> 08:28.132
Keep driving, or your neck gets
a new air hole.

08:28.215 --> 08:30.175
What do you want?

08:33.095 --> 08:34.722
I do the talking.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.434
Bring five million in cash to the docks
tomorrow midnight.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.311
Come alone, or the kid is history.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.897
Nod if you understand.

08:45.357 --> 08:46.525
Smart boy.

09:08.088 --> 09:10.549
I expect
there's no other option?

09:10.758 --> 09:14.303
The money's not important.
Getting Dick back is.

09:14.386 --> 09:15.721
Agreed, Master Bruce.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.933
But even so, didn't the kidnapper
leave some clue for Batman to follow?

09:20.267 --> 09:23.353
Just my torn shirt.
I'll have to fall back on my instincts.

09:23.687 --> 09:27.191
And right now, they're saying
Ivy's fairy tale lifestyle

09:27.274 --> 09:28.859
isn't everything it seems.

09:42.289 --> 09:43.791
Wait for me, guys.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.169
Bye, honey. Love you.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.273
<i>What's</i> she <i>doing now, sir?</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.651
Buying squash.

10:11.276 --> 10:13.278
I've been keeping tabs
on her all morning.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.824
And so far, she's done
nothing more incriminating

10:16.990 --> 10:18.784
than return an overdue video.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.160
Even paid the late fee.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.580
<i>Could it be Poison Ivy truly
has reformed?</i>

10:23.789 --> 10:26.667
I want to believe it. Why can't I?

10:29.586 --> 10:33.340
The greenhouse checks out too.
Nothing but plants and flowers.

10:33.423 --> 10:34.466
<i>Sir?</i>

10:35.676 --> 10:36.677
Later.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.647
- Can we watch cartoons?
- After your homework.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.278
This is a dead end.
I haven't found anything that-

11:00.033 --> 11:02.286
There are laws against spying on people.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.832
There are laws against
poisoning them too.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.128
Look around, Batman.

11:11.378 --> 11:15.299
I've got a nice house, a little garden
and a family that loves me.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.926
Why would I jeopardize that?

11:18.218 --> 11:21.513
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.057
I'm beginning to think you're right.

11:26.226 --> 11:27.269
Batman?

11:29.354 --> 11:30.522
Good luck.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.358
You too, Mrs. Carlyle.

11:49.249 --> 11:52.586
Wayne,
kick the case over here.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.421
Let me see the boy.

11:57.799 --> 11:59.593
The money. Now!

12:06.308 --> 12:07.559
Send out the boy.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.063
You hear me?

12:11.480 --> 12:12.731
I hear you.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.261
Goodbye, Mr. Wayne.

13:08.870 --> 13:10.914
Time to hit the drink.

13:54.666 --> 13:58.253
I guess I should be grateful that thing
used a fist on me and not poison.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.923
Right. But we're still in the dark
as to who's behind this.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.884
You don't think it's the plant lady?

14:03.967 --> 14:07.095
All she wants is to be left alone
with her husband and sons.

14:07.679 --> 14:11.016
- Sons?
- Carler's two boys, Chris and Kelly.

14:11.099 --> 14:12.392
I know Chris and Kelly.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.480
I was in Carlyle's class when his ex
brought them to visit last year.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.191
I thought Carlyle had custody.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.777
No. And here's another shocker for you.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.946
Chris and Kelly are girls.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.183
Hmm.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.195
No sign of Ivy.

15:05.737 --> 15:06.822
What's that?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.198
Insurance.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.131
Plastic?

15:47.737 --> 15:50.115
Just a happy little homemaker, huh?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.802
- Dr. Carlyle?
- Help me.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.141
She's insane. Has to be stopped.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.853
- You don't know what she's done.
- Mommy.

16:31.948 --> 16:33.158
Mommy.

16:33.533 --> 16:34.576
No-

16:38.121 --> 16:41.124
It... It isn't possible.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.543
- Mommy.
- Mommy.

16:44.544 --> 16:46.379
I was her doctor in Arkham.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.632
She said she wanted to reform.

16:49.090 --> 16:52.344
I trusted her, let her get too close.

17:01.728 --> 17:05.565
One little kiss, and dear Steven
was my slave.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.485
He was useful in signing
my release papers,

17:08.568 --> 17:12.072
and for supplying certain raw materials
for my experiments

17:12.614 --> 17:15.700
but the marriage was, well, a fake.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.037
And these mutations?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.540
Our children, Batman.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.544
Plant-based life forms
enhanced with Steven's DNA.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.004
They're not truly human.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.550
In fact, their life spans are somewhat
like certain rare flowers

17:31.633 --> 17:34.553
that blossom and die in a few days.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.054
I see.

17:36.429 --> 17:38.431
At first it looks like a child.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.809
Then it resembles Dr. Carlyle.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.271
- And in its final phase-
- In its final phase,

17:44.354 --> 17:46.022
before it burns itself out...

17:46.189 --> 17:51.027
The creature becomes my willing enforcer
and bodyguard.

17:56.449 --> 17:58.868
Thief and kidnapper
is more like it.

18:01.496 --> 18:03.665
It costs money to raise a family.

18:04.082 --> 18:07.210
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Yes, I have.

18:07.752 --> 18:10.797
I meant it when I said I wanted
a family that loves me.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.383
I just wanted it on my terms.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.219
Lady, you're nuts.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.555
Well, that's your opinion.

18:18.805 --> 18:21.474
Probably the last one
you'll ever have, too.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.934
Kids?

18:24.603 --> 18:28.231
That water I fed them
contained a super active growth formula.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.776
True, it cuts their life span down
to just a few minutes,

18:31.860 --> 18:33.528
but that's more time than you've got.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.348
This way, Doc.

19:16.529 --> 19:19.366
Great. She gave her little family
the formula too.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.329
Stay with Carlyle!

19:36.841 --> 19:38.927
Anyone else want their weeds whacked?

19:59.114 --> 20:00.156
Come on.

20:09.165 --> 20:10.375
My darlings!

20:14.337 --> 20:15.588
Weed killer.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.800
I figured what you were up to
involved plants

20:19.008 --> 20:21.136
so I pumped your water tanks
with herbicide.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.848
What was the tip-off, Batman?
Steven's kids?

20:25.390 --> 20:29.310
You couldn't replicate them as girls,
not with Carlyle's DNA.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.730
So, you took your chance with boys.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.774
But Ivy could replicate herself.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.529
What?

20:45.410 --> 20:50.165
Guess you weren't the only one
with an escape plan, huh, Batman?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.351
Most of the stolen property
was still in the lab

21:10.435 --> 21:12.395
along with Ivy's toxin formulas.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.190
Well, at least we have Ivy's toxins
to form an antidote.

21:15.815 --> 21:17.817
I'm just sorry she got away.

21:17.942 --> 21:21.905
Me too, Robin. But I don't think
we'll see her again anytime soon.

21:26.993 --> 21:28.745
<i>Ivy lost everything she had.</i>

21:29.496 --> 21:31.915
<i>Everything she said she ever wanted.</i>

21:35.627 --> 21:39.088
<i>For what it's worth,
I believed her when she told me</i>

21:39.172 --> 21:42.342
<i>for the first time in her life,
she was happy.</i>

22:18.586 --> 22:19.587
