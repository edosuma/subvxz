00:46.755 --> 00:47.551
Finn?

00:47.631 --> 00:48.473
Finn?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.391
Sorry.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.683
Finn, I'm bored.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.137
Are you sure Princess Bubblegum
doesn't like me anymore?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.437
Yeah, that's what she said.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.810
Sounds weird.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.142
Are you lying so you can do
this dinner thing alone with

00:58.225 --> 00:59.067
Bubblegum?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.142
No way.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.438
I don't know if this is a
good idea after your breakup

01:02.521 --> 01:03.693
with Flame Princess.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.820
P.B. ls out of your
age range, anyway.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.368
No way, man, I got
no ex-pec-tates.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.535
Whatever happens happens.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.533
Hey. Finn!

01:10.612 --> 01:11.408
Let's go.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.956
<i>Lates, bro. Comm...!</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:19.337
Hey-hey, things got
fancy 'round here.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.589
Hee-yolp!

01:27.379 --> 01:30.428
Thanks again for coming to
castle Lemongrab with me, Finn.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.930
I kind of hate these
diplomatic dinners.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.435
Also, I think the Lemongrabs
are getting weirder.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.560
Oh, uh, you know me...

01:37.639 --> 01:39.016
Pretty good with weird stuff.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.352
It's just a shame that
Jake didn't want to come.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.732
I love Jake!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.609
Mm, yeah.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.782
We all love Jake.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.383
Yo, Peebs, how's your lemon?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.085
Finn, this is mega-weird.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.546
Something's happened
to the two Lemongrabs.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.472
They used to be
exactly the same.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.639
No!

02:53.715 --> 02:54.932
You're floating too high!

02:55.008 --> 02:55.850
Unh!

02:55.926 --> 02:58.395
It's time for the floor show!

02:58.470 --> 03:01.223
Hey, Princess, look who happens
to carry a flute with him.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.306
No!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.441
Lemons only!

03:03.517 --> 03:05.394

03:42.347 --> 03:44.315
Unacceptable!

03:44.391 --> 03:46.439
Ugh. I can't watch
this any more.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.986
Excuse me, Finn.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.689
Okay. Let me know
if you get lonely.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.819
Unacceptable!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.616

What's your name, little boy?

My name is Badlemon Nohope, but

his ugly noise!

04:55.003 --> 04:55.799
Hey!

04:55.879 --> 04:58.382
By all accounts,
this is a brilliant

04:58.465 --> 05:00.058
and sensitive little boy!

05:00.133 --> 05:01.430
Thank you, mistress.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.514
I'm taking Lemonhope back
to the Candy Kingdom

05:04.596 --> 05:07.691
and enrolling him in a
school for gifted children.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.608
No.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.481
He needs to stay here!

05:10.560 --> 05:12.278
Ohh!

05:13.647 --> 05:18.073
I hope you will still be
joining us for dessert.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.115
We need to free
that darling boy.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.324
Maybe there's something in

05:24.407 --> 05:26.751
the Candy Kingdom/
Lemon-Earldom treaty,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.454
but I don't think there is.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.538
What about a prank?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.339
Finn, what are you
talking about?

05:31.414 --> 05:32.540
Mm, I don't know.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.049
Maybe if we prank Lemongrab,
like, just right,

05:36.127 --> 05:38.550
they'll let us...
take that guy home?

05:38.630 --> 05:39.927
Yeah, prank.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.384
I don't see how that's
going to help us at all.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.514
Pranks?

05:43.593 --> 05:44.593
Like old times.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.637
Finn, no.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.348
That's really...

05:48.431 --> 05:49.227
Hmm.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.307
Okay, yeah.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.818
We'll pull a prank.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.190
Like old times.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.950
O-kay!

06:03.029 --> 06:04.029
Puddin'.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.575
Bakin' soder.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.160
Vina-gurt.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.746
And... the bait.

06:10.829 --> 06:14.129
Now, when Lemongrab stirs his puhd...
pff-chuu!

06:14.207 --> 06:15.254
'Splode-cano.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.131
Pretty smart, dude.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.841
Hey.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.473
Ahh!

06:30.557 --> 06:31.683
<i>My mum.</i>

06:31.766 --> 06:34.394
Going to enjoy this puhd.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.107
Oh, really looking
forward to this puhd.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.611
Mm.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.989
Oh!

06:42.068 --> 06:42.910
Wh-wh-what is this?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.283
Ha ha!

06:44.362 --> 06:47.411
Now give us back Lemonhope
or prepare for mo' pranks!

06:47.490 --> 06:48.707
Dungeon!

06:51.119 --> 06:52.371
Guess I must admit...

06:52.454 --> 06:54.798
One would have a hard time
claiming that to have been

06:54.873 --> 06:55.873
a Pretty good plan.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.963
Sorry, P.B.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.171
No, no, your plan
was great, Finn.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.175
See? What's this?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.096
Huh?

07:02.172 --> 07:03.389
Your flute.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.183
Wow! Now Lemonhope can play it,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.278
and the Lemongrabs will come
open the door to smash the

07:07.302 --> 07:08.895
flute, and we can all escape!

07:08.970 --> 07:10.722
Really great work, Finn.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.977
Oh.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.479
Here, Lemonhope.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.777
Now, will you play
something for us?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.274
Something beautiful?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.277
<i>Yes, mistress.</i>

07:24.194 --> 07:25.696
Let me help you with...

07:25.779 --> 07:27.076
Lemonhope!

07:27.155 --> 07:28.953
I was sharp at the harp.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.878
Now it's my turn to learn
the flute to boot!

07:34.537 --> 07:35.537
Yeeeeeee!

07:37.165 --> 07:38.792
Oh, yes.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.343
Oh, mm.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.046
Oh, my.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.134
Oh, yes.

07:50.136 --> 07:55.267
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

07:55.350 --> 07:56.397
Whee!

07:58.395 --> 08:01.615
Come one and all and
join the dance!

08:04.776 --> 08:06.574
How dare you?!

08:06.653 --> 08:09.156
How dare you release
my prisoners?!

08:09.239 --> 08:11.037
You're soft, Lemongrab!

08:11.116 --> 08:14.245
Softer than an old
graham cracker!

08:14.327 --> 08:16.000
You're s-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oft!

08:20.125 --> 08:21.125
Yipe!

08:24.129 --> 08:24.971
Oh, no!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.093
We're locked in!

08:26.172 --> 08:27.172
Finn, give me your phone!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.137
I'm calling Jake!

08:28.216 --> 08:29.308
What? No.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.431
Let's, um...

08:30.510 --> 08:31.762
We could do another prank!

08:31.845 --> 08:33.972
I brought some of your
superspicy hot sauce.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.056
Ah, so spice!

08:35.140 --> 08:36.767
Finn, this is serious!

08:36.850 --> 08:39.227
But... my other plan worked.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.860
Finn, your other plan failed,
which was part of my plan,

08:42.938 --> 08:43.986
which worked.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.157
Your plan?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.327
But I thought we were
having fun together.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.825
Finn, I have citizens
who need me!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.748
I can't always treat everything
like a little-boy game.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.576
Oh.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.659
Yeah.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.999
No, that's cool.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.546
Mistress! Mistress, look!

08:58.621 --> 09:00.544
Something scary
is happening now!

09:02.333 --> 09:05.052
How dare you?!

09:05.128 --> 09:07.005
After all I've done for you!

09:07.088 --> 09:10.137
You try to steal
my Lemonhope away!

09:10.216 --> 09:12.184
You're too old, Princess!

09:12.260 --> 09:14.012
Too old for pranks!

09:14.095 --> 09:15.938
Too old!

09:16.014 --> 09:17.516
I've tried imprisoning!

09:17.599 --> 09:19.772
I've tried reconditioning!

09:19.851 --> 09:22.274
You leave me no choice.

09:22.353 --> 09:26.199
Lemongentr-y-y-y-y-y!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.571
Go forth!

09:28.818 --> 09:30.320
Go forth now!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.622
Sorry! Sorry, sir!

09:32.697 --> 09:33.914
Get to safety, Princess.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.082
I'll hold them off.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.535
What?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.291
Sorry, sir!

09:38.369 --> 09:39.369
Sorry!

09:39.412 --> 09:40.914
I'm sorry, sir.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.965
Sorry.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.762
Wait. So, do you not like any
games or just little-boy games?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.463
Finn...

09:54.719 --> 09:56.346
Lemonbrothers, stop!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.272
Stop and listen!

09:59.682 --> 10:03.061
It has cost me much,
but I have learned...

10:03.144 --> 10:06.569
Lemon need not squeeze
Lemon to survive!

10:06.648 --> 10:09.117
Lemonhope, go forth!

10:09.192 --> 10:11.536
Grow strong and return for us!

10:11.611 --> 10:14.114
Go!

10:14.197 --> 10:15.824
Hope! Hope! Hope!

10:15.907 --> 10:19.537
Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope!

10:19.619 --> 10:23.169
Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope! Hope!
Hope! Hope! Hope!

10:24.541 --> 10:27.340
You're going to love the
Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.011
You'll learn all about playing

10:29.087 --> 10:32.136
and play math and
learning all day long.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.842
And you'll never get yelled at.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.348
Unless you drink my soda
from out the fridge.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.849
Yes, mistress.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.021
Yo, man. How's it going?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.269
Terrible?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.396
Well, yeah, mostly.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.068
But I think I learned something.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.521
Goon
