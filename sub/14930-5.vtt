WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:05.573
HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.607
HEY. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.476
THIS IS JESSICA,
MY KID SISTER.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
JESSICA,
THIS IS UNCLE EDDIE.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.212
HI.
HI.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.346
SHE DIDN'T JUST
SHOW UP LOOKING

00:12.380 --> 00:13.481
FOR YOUR DAD, DID SHE?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.283
SHE'S A CHARITY CASE.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.718
I GOT HER AT SCHOOL.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.453
WHY WOULD YOU SIGN UP
FOR THIS?

00:19.487 --> 00:20.621
I THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS--

00:20.654 --> 00:23.157
I WAS TALKING
TO JESSICA.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.694
I'M A VERY CARING,
GIVING...

00:26.727 --> 00:28.062
CAREGIVER.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.197
AND I FELT
THAT IT WAS TIME

00:29.230 --> 00:31.099
THAT I GAVE BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.633
OH, YEAH. I WAS THERE
WHEN SHE REALIZED IT.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.769
IT WAS PRETTY INSPIRING.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.339
JUST SO YOU KNOW, GREG,

00:38.372 --> 00:39.707
I WROTE MY HOME NUMBER,

00:39.740 --> 00:43.144
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER,
AND MY E-MAIL ADDRESS.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.812
RIGHT HERE.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.680
I UNDERLINED THEM.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.615
OK, GREAT.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.483
WE'LL TRY TO HOOK YOU UP
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.820
'CAUSE I'M
ALL ABOUT HOOKIN' UP!

00:52.853 --> 00:53.754
GREAT.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.324
OH, JIMMY! THIS IS
MY ACTUAL LITTLE BROTHER.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.258
REAL LIVE ONE!

00:57.291 --> 00:58.559
LILY, GET OFF OF ME!

00:58.592 --> 00:59.693
GOD, I HATE YOU!

00:59.727 --> 01:02.096
JUST SHUT UP!

01:04.598 --> 01:08.169
OH, THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

01:09.270 --> 01:13.307
SO, WHEN--WHEN DO
YOU PICK ME UP?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.476
OH, I--I DON'T
GO WITH YOU.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.678
IT'S JUST YOU
AND YOUR KID SISTER.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.449
OH, OK. UM...

01:24.685 --> 01:28.456
OK, INITIALLY
THERE WAS A MUTUAL
ATTRACTION,

01:28.489 --> 01:30.758
BUT NOW I'M HAPPY
TO BE GIVING MY TIME

01:30.791 --> 01:32.893
TO HELP
AN UNDERPRIVILEGED
CHILD.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.163
I'M NOT UNDERPRIVILEGED.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.265
OH, YES,
YOU ARE, SWEETIE,

01:37.298 --> 01:37.998
BUT THAT'S OK.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.534
WE CAN STILL HAVE FUN
TOGETHER.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.871
HEY, BABY!

01:43.904 --> 01:45.273
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.374
JUST WAITIN'
ON MY LADY.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.475
YOU WEREN'T WATCHING
BODY HEAT, WERE YOU?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.810
'CAUSE I GOT A LOT OF STUFF
I GOTTA DO THIS AFTERNOON.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.380
NO, NO, BUT I GOT
SOMETHING I GOTTA
SHOW YOU, THOUGH.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.914
IS IT THE NEW CRIB?
WHERE IS IT?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.617
OK, WELL, I WENT TO BUY
THE CRIB AS PLANNED--

01:56.650 --> 01:57.385
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.553
I MADE A LITTLE STOP
ALONG THE WAY.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.690
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE
A QUICK STOP.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.393
UH, AT OFF TRACK GAMING?

02:05.426 --> 02:08.362
I GOT A LOCK
IN THE FOURTH RACE.
YOU WANT IN?

02:08.396 --> 02:09.697
A LOCK?
YOU MEAN IT'S FIXED?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.233
WHOA, WHOA. NO.
WHO SAID FIXED?

02:12.266 --> 02:13.601
WHY--WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT?

02:13.634 --> 02:14.602
YOU JUST SAID
IT WAS A LOCK.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.238
IT IS A LOCK.
IT'S GUARANTEED.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.239
SO, IT'S FIXED.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.340
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THAT WORD?

02:19.373 --> 02:21.875
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN
HAVE MONEY, MAN.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.311
YOU GOT $400.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.345
YEAH, TO BUY A CRIB
WITH IT.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.615
CRIB?
IF THIS HORSE HITS,
YOU COULD BUY A BABY.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.618
YOU LOST OUR CRIB MONEY
ON A HORSE?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.653
OK, WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.289
OK? ANOTHER WAY IS...

02:35.323 --> 02:37.191
THAT I WON!

02:37.225 --> 02:38.659
YEAH! YES! YES!

02:38.692 --> 02:40.528
I GOT THE CRIB, AND...

02:40.561 --> 02:42.930
A BRAND-NEW TV! YEAH!

02:42.963 --> 02:45.933
* DAH DAH DAH, DAH DAH,
DAH DAH DAH *

02:45.966 --> 02:48.602
CHECK IT OUT. 43 INCHES
OF FLAT-SCREEN,

02:48.636 --> 02:49.837
HI-DEF, SURROUND-SOUND,

02:49.870 --> 02:53.274
CINEMATIC
VIEWING PLEASURE.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.209
HUH.

02:55.243 --> 02:58.412
NO. "HUH" IS
A 13-INCH TV
WITH THE VCR BUILT IN.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.981
THIS IS, "MY HUSBAND'S
THE GREATEST PROVIDER
OF ALL TIME,

03:01.014 --> 03:04.618
AND I SHOULD REWARD HIM
IMMEDIATELY."

03:05.253 --> 03:06.887
OK, GREAT PROVIDER,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.289
UH, BEFORE
THE REWARDING STARTS,

03:08.322 --> 03:09.757
LET'S JUST BE CLEAR
ON ONE THING.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.359
YOU TOOK OUR BABY'S
CRIB MONEY,

03:11.392 --> 03:12.793
AND YOU GAMBLED IT
ON A HORSE?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.363
I DIDN'T GAMBLE IT.
I WON!

03:15.396 --> 03:16.330
WELL, WHAT IF YOU'D LOST?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.731
I COULDN'T, BABY!
IT WAS A LOCK.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.867
EDDIE TOLD ME.
TELL HER, ED.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.668
LOCK.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.536
OH, THANK YOU.
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.337
YOU TRUSTED
OUR BABY'S MONEY

03:23.371 --> 03:24.538
TO THE MAN WHO LIVES
IN OUR BASEMENT.

03:24.572 --> 03:28.376
LOOK, HE'S AN EXPERT
ON THESE THINGS, OK?
THIS IS HIS AREA.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.279
NO. HIS AREA
IS OUR BASEMENT.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.314
WE CAN'T ALL LIVE
UP HERE ABOVE THE GROUND

03:33.347 --> 03:35.749
IN CLOUD CITY, CLAUDIA.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.752
SO, HOW MUCH
DID THE TV COST?

03:38.786 --> 03:41.021
WELL, FOR THE AVERAGE JERK
ON THE STREET, $1,000.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.357
BUT FOR ME,
IT WAS LIKE IT WAS FREE.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.393
YOU WON $1,000?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.395
YEAH! AND I TRADED IT
IN FOR THE TV.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.897
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY THINGS WE NEED?

03:49.930 --> 03:53.567
AND YOU SPENT $1,000
ON A BIGGER VERSION
OF SOMETHING WE ALREADY HAD!

03:53.601 --> 03:55.636
WITH PICTURE IN PICTURE!

03:55.669 --> 03:57.571
OH, MY GOD!

03:57.605 --> 03:58.472
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JIM?

03:58.506 --> 04:03.377
YOU GUYS, WE'RE--
WE'RE FINALLY A FAMILY.

04:21.395 --> 04:24.398
HEY. SEAN, DID YOU PUT
THE CRIB TOGETHER YET?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.766
UH, I WOULD'VE, BABE,

04:25.799 --> 04:27.601
BUT I'VE BEEN BUSY
BONDING WITH OUR SON.

04:27.635 --> 04:32.005
CAN I SEE THE REMOTE?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF IT, MAN!

04:34.542 --> 04:35.443
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:35.476 --> 04:38.078
I'M MAKING COOKIES
FOR ME AND MY KID SISTER.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.246
AWW. HOW'S IT GOING
WITH HER?

04:39.279 --> 04:43.451
YOU KNOW, I AM
AN EVEN BETTER BIG SISTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.086
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DO TODAY?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.088
WE COULD PLAY
BEAUTY SHOP.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.791
OOH! THAT'LL BE FUN.

04:52.025 --> 04:55.496
I LIKE IT PARTED
ON THE LEFT.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.700
MY DAD WORKS 2 JOBS,
SO I HARDLY EVER SEE HIM.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.736
YOU ARE SO LUCKY!

05:03.904 --> 05:05.406
SO, THIS ONE IS ME,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.975
AND THIS ONE IS ASHLEY,

05:08.008 --> 05:10.411
AND THIS ONE IS BRAD.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.346
HEY, LILY.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.747
HEY, BRAD. WHATEVER.

05:13.781 --> 05:17.718
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO TALK TO YOUR STUPID
SLUT GIRLFRIEND?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.353
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS, LILY.

05:19.387 --> 05:22.456
WELL, YOU'RE
JUST HEADLESS.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.824
HEY, THAT'S MY DOLL!

05:23.857 --> 05:26.927
IT WAS BEING A JERK.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.464
IT'S A LOT OF WORK
TO TOUCH A YOUNG LIFE,

05:30.498 --> 05:31.298
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.067
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET A KID SISTER, MOM.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.904
I HAVE 3 KIDS,
AND I'M PREGNANT.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.040
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.047
WHOA, HEY!
MOM!

05:47.080 --> 05:49.650
JUST A LITTLE CLEANING.
CAN'T IT WAIT?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.452
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE FOR 2 DAYS.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.820
WHEN DO YOU SUGGEST
I DO IT?

05:52.853 --> 05:53.521
WHEN THE SHOW'S
OVER.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.022
OH, YES, I'D HATE
TO INTERRUPT

05:55.055 --> 05:57.525
THE COMPELLING DRAMA
OF CELEBRITY POKER.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.694
VINCE VAUGHN'S
GOT A PAIR OF JACKS.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.629
DON'T YOU HAVE
HOMEWORK TO DO?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.464
YEAH, YEAH. I'M DOING IT
DURING COMMERCIALS.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.498
I'VE BEEN CHECKIN' IT.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.767
OK, THAT'S IT.
UPSTAIRS. GO.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.102
MOVE.
FINE. FINE.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.840
HEY, LET ME KNOW
IF CARMEN ELECTRA
PICKS UP HER FLUSH.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.409
GOD. DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

06:15.443 --> 06:18.178
OH, YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE
TO HEAR WHAT MY PROBLEM IS.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.513
YOUR PROBLEM IS
IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T

06:19.547 --> 06:20.648
SPENT ENOUGH TIME
IN FRONT OF THIS TV.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.417
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS.
NO, SERIOUSLY.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.486
IF YOU COULD SIT DOWN
IN FRONT OF THIS THING
FOR 48 HOURS

06:25.519 --> 06:27.054
AND HONESTLY TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T LOVE IT,

06:27.087 --> 06:29.557
THEN SOMETHING
IS WRONG WITH YOU.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.198
HELLO?
HI. IS LILY HERE?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.568
UH, YEAH. SHE'S
IN THE KITCHEN.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.505
WOW. THAT'S THE BIGGEST TV
I'VE EVER SEEN!

06:44.538 --> 06:47.608
THANK YOU.
I WON IT GAMBLING.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.677
NEAT.

06:51.945 --> 06:52.980
NEAT.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.582
SEE WHAT I'M--
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

06:54.615 --> 06:57.017
YEAH. GAMBLING IS NEAT.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.587
ALCOHOLISM
IS REALLY COOL, TOO.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.688
SHOPLIFTING ROCKS!

07:00.721 --> 07:02.490
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT BACK?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.091
NO, NO. I THINK
YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR TV,

07:04.124 --> 07:05.593
AND EVERY TIME
YOU LOOK AT IT,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.528
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT IT,

07:07.561 --> 07:08.395
I'LL BE REMINDED
OF THE TIME

07:08.428 --> 07:09.963
THAT YOU PUT YOUR
OWN FRIVOLOUS DESIRES

07:09.997 --> 07:11.131
ABOVE THE NEEDS
OF YOUR FAMILY.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.600
WELL, I'LL JUST HAVE TO
WORK THROUGH THAT

07:12.633 --> 07:15.669
IN MY OWN SPECIAL WAY.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.747
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT! DAMN IT! YOU WIN!

07:26.780 --> 07:27.681
YOU'LL TAKE IT BACK?

07:27.715 --> 07:28.982
OH, HELL, NO. NO,
YOU CAN FINISH VACUUMING.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.586
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND TAKE A SHOWER
BEFORE THE KNICKS GAME.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.694
TV narrator: THE CITIZENS
OF POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM

07:40.728 --> 07:44.532
HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS IN STORE.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.601
WOW.  THAT IS NEAT.

07:47.635 --> 07:51.639
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE MALL TODAY.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.507
DID YOU BRING
YOUR DOLLS?

07:53.541 --> 07:54.642
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T STAY.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.977
MY FAMILY'S MOVING
TO NORTH CAROLINA.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.912
WHAT

07:58.946 --> 08:01.682
MY MOM'S WAITING
FOR ME IN THE CAR.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.051
I JUST CAME TO SAY
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.619
I'VE GOT A LOT OUT OF IT.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.319
REALLY?

08:06.353 --> 08:07.821
YEAH. I'LL ALWAYS
THINK OF YOU

08:07.855 --> 08:10.724
WHEN I'M IRONING
OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.694
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.
COME HERE!

08:16.329 --> 08:17.865
BYE.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.835
MY LITTLE SISTER'S

08:21.869 --> 08:24.004
MOVING
TO NORTH CAROLINA.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.740
OH, I'M SORRY.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.175
WHO'S GONNA DO YOUR NAILS?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.778
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT,
EDDIE. I--

08:30.811 --> 08:32.780
I REALLY MADE
A DIFFERENCE
IN HER LIFE.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.550
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO
TOUCH SOMEONE'S HEART?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.752
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

08:38.786 --> 08:42.255
GUY I KNOW WAS
IN A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.892
I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.930
OH, DAMN IT, DAMN IT,
DAMN IT!

08:49.963 --> 08:50.698
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:50.731 --> 08:53.300
I SPILLED ORANGE SODA
INTO THE TV.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.668
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.303
BECAUSE IT
LOOKED THIRSTY.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.171
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

08:58.205 --> 08:59.740
I PUT THE SODA
ON TOP OF THE TV,

08:59.773 --> 09:02.075
AND I BUMPED INTO IT
WHEN I WAS VACUUMING.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.577
WHERE DID SEAN
PUT THE WARRANTY?

09:03.611 --> 09:04.945
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.748
ARE YOU CRAZY? HE KNOWS
HOW MUCH I HATE THAT TV.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.683
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE'LL THINK.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.591
OOPS!

09:23.697 --> 09:24.698
YES!

09:29.002 --> 09:29.803
WHY WOULD HE THINK THAT?

09:29.837 --> 09:32.039
'CAUSE IT'S JUST
LIKE THAT OIL PAINTING

09:32.072 --> 09:33.273
OF ALICE COOPER
THAT HE LOVED.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.710
OH, I REMEMBER IT.
YOU USED THAT TO PUT OUT
THAT KITCHEN FIRE.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.712
ACTUALLY, I USED IT
TO START THAT KITCHEN FIRE.

09:38.746 --> 09:42.783
BUT I CONFESSED,
AND HE DIDN'T FORGIVE ME
FOR MONTHS.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.952
I JUST HAVE TO FIND
THE DAMN WARRANTY!

09:44.985 --> 09:47.087
I HATE TO TELL YOU,
BUT NO WARRANTY IN THE WORLD

09:47.120 --> 09:50.290
COVERS SPILLING A DRINK
IN THE TV.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.192
WELL, I HAVE TO
GET IT FIXED.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.093
OK? I HAVE TO
GET IT FIXED.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.928
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.
HOW DO I GET IT FIXED?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.129
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST THE GUY

09:56.163 --> 09:59.266
WHO LIVES IN YOUR BASEMENT
AND LEADS YOUR HUSBAND
TO GAMBLE.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.902
EDDIE, DON'T DO THIS TO ME,
ALL RIGHT? I NEED YOU.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.370
WILL YOU ADMIT
THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE

10:03.403 --> 10:06.740
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BASEMENTS
HAVE SOME VALUE?

10:06.774 --> 10:09.643
YES. THEY ARE
THE BACKBONE OF SOCIETY.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.144
NOW, WILL YOU HELP ME,
PLEASE?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.345
THE TV'S NOT WORKING.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.246
YEAH, I KNOW.
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.415
HE'S UPSTAIRS. YOU WANT ME
TO GO TELL HIM?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.249
NO! NO.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.517
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME, OK?

10:17.550 --> 10:21.221
I NEED YOU TO KEEP
YOUR DAD FROM WATCHING TV
UNTIL WE GET BACK.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.223
OH, IT CAN'T BE DONE.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.725
ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.026
IF YOU DON'T
DO THIS FOR ME,

10:26.059 --> 10:27.895
I WILL PICK YOU UP
FROM SCHOOL EVERY DAY

10:27.928 --> 10:28.696
IN AN INSIDE-OUT
NIGHTGOWN

10:28.729 --> 10:31.131
AND HUG YOU IN FRONT
OF YOUR FRIENDS.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.834
I'M ON IT.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.803
LET'S GO.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.340
NO!

10:50.417 --> 10:52.720
I'M SCREWED,
TOTALLY SCREWED.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.422
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
TELL HIM YOU BROKE HIS TV.

10:55.455 --> 10:58.258
YOU KNOW?
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
HE'S A RATIONAL MAN.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.226
HAVE YOU SEEN THE WAY
HE TOUCHES IT?

10:59.259 --> 11:02.796
TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL TELL HIM
I BROKE THE TV.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.231
REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.767
YEAH. ANYTHING YOU WANT.
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.935
HEY, GUYS.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.069
LATER.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.972
HEY. WHAT--WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?
WH

11:12.005 --> 11:12.740
HE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.174
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.275
JUST GONNA WATCH
A LITTLE TV.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.243
HEY, NO, NO, NO!

11:16.276 --> 11:18.478
NO, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I'M FEELING REALLY SEXY.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.947
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.414
YEAH. I'M FEELIN' SEXY
FOR 2.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.351
OH. WELL, BABY,
I DIDN'T REALLY COUNT
ON YOU FEELING SEXY,

11:24.384 --> 11:28.388
SO I--IN THE SHOWER,
I KIND OF--I'M GOOD.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.190
JUST--JUST WAIT...

11:31.324 --> 11:32.259
WOW!

11:32.292 --> 11:33.927
WHAT?

11:33.961 --> 11:36.396
UH, CARSON DALY
JUST GOT A FLUSH.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.265
IT'S JUST LIKE WE'RE SITTING
AT THE TABLE WITH HIM.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.101
IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S AMAZING, YEAH!

11:41.134 --> 11:43.470
IT'S GREAT.
IT'S A GREAT PICTURE,
GREAT SOUND,

11:43.503 --> 11:44.604
AND THE BEST THING
ABOUT IT

11:44.637 --> 11:48.008
IS THAT NO ONE
SPILLED ORANGE SODA
DOWN THE BACK OF IT.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.843
SO, YOU KNOW.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.244
YEAH, I DO KNOW.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.280
JIMMY TOLD ME.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.815
JIMMY!

11:54.848 --> 11:55.983
WHAT?
"WHAT"?

11:56.016 --> 11:59.052
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP HIM OCCUPIED,
NOT RAT ME OUT.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.454
I COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.056
ALL RIGHT, SO,
YOU WANNA GO WATCH TV?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.892
NO, WHY DON'T WE PLAY THIS
ONE MORE TIME?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.427
COME ON, JIMMY.
WE'VE DONE IT, LIKE, 6 TIMES.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.463
YOU'RE, LIKE,
BETTER THAN CLAPTON.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.467
ALL RIGHT. ONE MORE TIME.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.504
ALL RIGHT!

12:17.537 --> 12:18.839
LET'S GO WATCH
SOME TV.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.274
WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.510
I JUST BEAT YOU 21-3.
LET'S GO.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.912
OH, ARE YOU GONNA
CRY ABOUT IT?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.479
LITTLE BABY WANNA CRY?
LET'S GO!

12:26.513 --> 12:27.915
LET'S PLAY AGAIN, TO 50!

12:27.948 --> 12:29.416
COME ON. LET'S JUST
WATCH THE GAME.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.417
WHY CAN'T
WE JUST TALK, DAD?

12:30.450 --> 12:34.354
WE CAN TALK AND WATCH
THE GAME AT THE SAME TIME.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.491
HOW DO YOU--HOW DO YOU
KNOW IF YOU'RE GAY?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.463
WOW.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.398
OK, UH...

12:45.432 --> 12:46.233
ALL RIGHT, JIM, I'VE--

12:46.266 --> 12:49.436
I'VE NEVER TOLD
THIS STORY TO ANYBODY.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.972
MOM BROKE THE TV!

12:52.005 --> 12:56.109
OK, THERE WAS ONLY
SO MUCH YOU CAN ASK ME
TO ENDURE.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.079
WELL, HE SEEMS
VERY UPSET.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.981
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO TALK TO HIM.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.382
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.517
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THE TV,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.553
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.521
WELL, DID YOU?
NO! NO! THIS
IS VERY DIFFERENT

13:08.555 --> 13:09.656
FROM THE ALICE COOPER
PAINTING.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.525
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU BURNED THAT
ALICE COOPER PAINTING!

13:12.559 --> 13:13.626
THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.794
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I WORKED ON THAT?
FOR 4 MONTHS!

13:14.828 --> 13:18.465
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO PAINT A GUILLOTINE
IN MOTION?

13:18.498 --> 13:19.732
YES, YOU TOLD ME
MANY, MANY TIMES.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.502
BESIDES, OBVIOUSLY
I DIDN'T BREAK THE TV,
'CAUSE IT STILL WORKS.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.073
NO, BECAUSE I PAID
SOMEONE 500 BUCKS
TO COME AND FIX IT!

13:26.106 --> 13:27.240
WHERE'D YOU GET
500 BUCKS?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.475
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT

13:28.508 --> 13:30.410
IS THAT YOU'RE A LIAR
AND A BREAKER.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.913
SEAN, WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT MONEY?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.315
WHAT? IT'S PART OF THE 1,500
I WON GAMBLING.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.417
1,500? YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS 1,000.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.552
YEAH. 1,000's
PART OF 1,500.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.355
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT EXTRA MONEY?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.524
GET SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR THE BABY.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.327
WHAT?
TIVO.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.963
WELL, I HOPE YOU GET
ADULT CHANNELS ON THAT TV,

13:49.997 --> 13:52.966
'CAUSE YOU WON'T BE
SEEING ME NAKED.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.201
WELL, THAT'S FINE,

13:54.234 --> 13:56.103
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE SEEING
A LOT OF ME NAKED,

13:56.136 --> 13:58.906
A WHOLE LOT OF ME NAKED!

14:00.507 --> 14:03.210
HEY, DAD.
HEY, LIL.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.213
OHH!

14:08.916 --> 14:10.617
OHH!

14:10.650 --> 14:11.251
WHAT?!

14:11.284 --> 14:13.420
I WANNA TALK ABOUT
MY DAY!

14:13.453 --> 14:16.223
OK, FINE.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.224
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:17.257 --> 14:19.559
I WAS BETRAYED.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.863
JESSICA?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.466
OH, HEY, LILY.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.970
HEY. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MOVING
TO NORTH CAROLINA.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.104
I AM.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.573
THEN WHO'S THIS?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.542
UM...MY MOM.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.211
COME ON, MOM. OUR FLIGHT'S
LEAVING IN 10 MINUTES.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.147
SHE'S IN MY CLASS.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.383
LILY, JESSICA'S
MY NEW KID SISTER.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.251
WHAT?

14:44.284 --> 14:45.118
I'M SORRY, LILY.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.954
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO FIND OUT THIS WAY.

14:46.987 --> 14:47.955
OH, MY GOD.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.624
WELL,
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO--

14:51.658 --> 14:53.260
WAS THERE OVERLAP?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.595
I

14:55.628 --> 14:57.998
ALL RIGHT,
BUT THAT'S OK.
THAT'S OK.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.934
JUST GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.669
I CAN DO BETTER.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.537
GOOD-BYE, LILY.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.339
WAIT!

15:06.373 --> 15:07.340
MY HOODIE!

15:07.374 --> 15:09.542
OK, I'M SORRY!
I'LL FIX IT.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.377
OHH!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.278
MY ICE CREAM!

15:11.311 --> 15:14.647
DON'T MOVE. IT HASN'T
HIT THE GROUND YET.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.385
MY BOOTS!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.653
COME ON, HONEY,
LET'S GO.

15:22.089 --> 15:26.259
WELL, IF YOU GO NOW,
DON'T BOTHER COMING BACK!

15:28.361 --> 15:30.097
COME BACK!

15:30.130 --> 15:32.399
WOW,
THAT'S REALLY HARSH.
I JUST DON'T THINK

15:32.432 --> 15:35.168
THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN,
UH...

15:35.202 --> 15:37.570
SAY THAT HASN'T
ALREADY BEEN SAID. HUH?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.706
JUST WATCH
YOUR STUPID TV!

15:39.739 --> 15:42.275
OK, I WILL.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.376
OH, IT'S A COMMERCIAL,
LIL.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.479
COME ON BACK.
WE CAN TALK A BIT MORE.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.219
HEY.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.620
OH, IS THERE
A COMMERCIAL ON?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.688
YEAH, IT'S
FOR A NEW SODA.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.425
"NOW WITH MORE
TV-KILLING ACTION."

15:58.458 --> 16:00.393
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.130
OK, LOOK, BABY,
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT
ABOUT IT ANYMORE, OK?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.697
WELL, I DON'T
WANNA FIGHT, EITHER.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.832
ALL RIGHT, SO, LET'S AGREE
TO KEEP THE TV,

16:05.865 --> 16:09.202
AND I JUST PROMISE I'LL SPEND
LESS TIME IN FRONT OF IT.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.237
FINE.
FINE?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.471
OK, BABY.
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

16:11.504 --> 16:12.505
AND PUT THAT CRIB
TOGETHER NOW.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.674
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.509
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
YOU WERE ON ME TO PUT
THE CRIB TOGETHER.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.479
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE CRIB THING.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.214
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET RID OF IT.

16:21.248 --> 16:21.881
WHAT?

16:21.914 --> 16:23.183
YEAH, I READ
IN THIS MAGAZINE

16:23.216 --> 16:24.651
THAT A BABY REALLY
IS BETTER OFF SLEEPING

16:24.684 --> 16:26.786
WITH THEIR PARENTS
FOR, LIKE,
THE FIRST 5 YEARS.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.790
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'M GONNA GO TAKE CARE
OF THE CRIB.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.626
THE--THE CRIB IS GONE.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.164
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
SELLING YOUR BABY'S CRIB
FOR GAMBLING MONEY

16:37.197 --> 16:39.232
IS THE FIRST SIGN
OF A PROBLEM.

16:39.266 --> 16:42.335
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
I DID NOT SELL THE CRIB.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.171
I RETURNED IT,
AND I'M GONNA USE
MY WINNINGS

16:44.204 --> 16:46.173
TO BUY IT BACK
AND FIX THE TV.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.274
YOU GONNA HELP ME
OR WHAT?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.376
YEAH. HIGH HAT
IN THE FIFTH.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.577
AND THAT'S A FIX, RIGHT?

16:50.610 --> 16:51.611
IT'S A LOCK.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.581
YEAH, BUT BY "A LOCK,"
YOU MEAN IT'S A FIX, RIGHT?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.816
NO, BY LOCK,
I MEAN KEEP QUIET.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.518
IS THIS HORSE
GONNA WIN OR NOT?

16:58.551 --> 17:01.421
WHAT ARE YOU--
ARE YOU WEARING A WIRE?

17:02.789 --> 17:03.456
YES! YES!

17:03.490 --> 17:05.558
SECOND PLACE!
WHAT DID I WIN?!

17:05.592 --> 17:07.427
LET ME SEE.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.461
ZERO.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.429
WHAT?

17:09.462 --> 17:11.664
IF YOU'D BET HIM
TO PLACE,
YOU WOULD'VE WON.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.534
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU TELL ME
THIS WAS A LOCK?!

17:14.567 --> 17:15.568
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FRUSTRATION.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.270
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE LOST
A LOT OF MONEY ON LOCKS.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.771
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.674
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER LOCK,
AND THEN I'LL BET IT TO PLACE.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.310
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE MONEY.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.777
THAT'S OK.
WE--WE CAN GET SOME.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.248
HEY, ANYBODY
WANNA BUY A WATCH?

17:28.848 --> 17:31.784
I'LL BUY
YOUR SWEATER.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.787
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SO, YOU BROKE THE TV,

17:34.821 --> 17:37.757
SOLD THE CRIB,
AND LOST THE MONEY?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.093
BUT I KEPT MY CLOTHES.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.829
OH, WELL, I'M REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.665
JIMMY, JUST TELL ME!
AM I BAD BIG SISTER?

17:45.698 --> 17:49.802
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE
BIG SISTER.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.306
OH. OK, THEN.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.576
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

17:56.609 --> 17:57.844
BECAUSE...

17:57.877 --> 18:00.780
MY--MY KID SISTER LEFT ME
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.350
REALLY? I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.586
IT'S OK. I WAS JUST HOPING
THAT MAYBE SHE WAS WRONG

18:06.619 --> 18:08.755
AND I'M NOT
A BAD BIG SISTER,

18:08.788 --> 18:11.624
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYONE,

18:11.658 --> 18:12.825
SO I GUESS I AM.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.794
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.530
NO, NO,
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M--

18:17.564 --> 18:20.867
I'M SELFISH. I'M NEEDY.
I'M A BAD LISTENER.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.403
WELL, ACTUA--
LET ME FINISH!

18:23.436 --> 18:24.804
I'M OVERBEARING.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.174
YES, YOU ARE
ALL THOSE THINGS,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.575
BUT, YOU KNOW,

18:28.608 --> 18:30.510
THERE'VE ALSO BEEN TIMES
WHEN YOU'VE HELPED ME.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.245
COME ON, WHEN?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.813
REMEMBER
ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO

18:33.846 --> 18:35.014
WHEN I WORE
THAT MESH T-SHIRT,

18:35.047 --> 18:38.518
AND ALL THOSE KIDS
CALLED ME NETTY
AND MESHY AND SHOWGIRL?

18:38.551 --> 18:39.686
YES.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.888
WELL, YOU STOOD UP
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

18:41.921 --> 18:42.755
YOU SAID, "THAT'S
MY LITTLE BROTHER,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.491
"AND HE MAY DRESS
LIKE A CABARET DANCER,

18:44.524 --> 18:48.428
BUT IF YOU MESS WITH HIM,
THEN YOU MESS WITH ME."

18:48.461 --> 18:50.897
I DID? I--I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.733
WELL, I DO,
AND IT REALLY
MEANT A LOT TO ME.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.834
WOW.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.270
I AM A GOOD BIG SISTER.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.406
THANKS, JIMMY.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.811
DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN?

19:04.844 --> 19:07.714
SOME OF IT.
I ONLY MADE IT TO THE DOOR
WITH THAT SHIRT ON.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.649
LILY CALLED ME
ALL THOSE THINGS,

19:09.682 --> 19:12.419
SO I RAN UPSTAIRS
AND CHANGED.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.855
I GET IT!
I'M A HYPOCRITE, OK?

19:15.888 --> 19:18.291
NO, NO, IT'S NOT OK.
YOU GAVE ME HELL
ABOUT THAT TV.

19:18.325 --> 19:22.462
YOU KNOW, "GAMBLING'S WRONG,
AND TV'S BAD, AND..."

19:22.495 --> 19:24.464
SOMETHING-SOMETHING
FRIVOLOUS.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.765
HOW IS WHAT I DID

19:25.798 --> 19:27.434
ANY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT YOU DID?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.336
'CAUSE YOU LOST!

19:29.536 --> 19:30.937
I LOST TRYING
TO FIX THE THING

19:30.970 --> 19:31.871
THAT YOU WASTED
OUR MONEY ON.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.407
NO, NO, I WASTED
MY MONEY ON IT.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.876
HEY, YOU AND I
ARE A TEAM HERE, OK?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.379
THERE'S NO "MY MONEY"
IN "TEAM."

19:39.412 --> 19:42.449
THERE'S AN "M" AND...

19:42.482 --> 19:43.383
AN "E"...

19:43.416 --> 19:44.617
THE POINT IS, WE'RE
IN THIS THING TOGETHER.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.687
OK, SO IF WE THROW MONEY
DOWN THE TOILET
ON SOMETHING STUPID,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.456
THEN WE DO IT AS A TEAM.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.357
EXACTLY.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.625
OK, WELL, THEN I SHOULD
PROBABLY TELL YOU

19:52.659 --> 19:55.462
ABOUT THE $1,500
THAT WE WON.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.963
WHAT?

19:56.996 --> 19:59.432
IT WAS ACTUALLY 1,800.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.900
SO WE HAVE
AN EXTRA $300?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.669
YEAH. SO WE CAN TAKE
THE 300 BUCKS,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.304
AND WE CAN
GO GET THE CRIB.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.838
OR...

20:05.872 --> 20:07.707
WE COULD HIT
THE O.T.G. TONIGHT.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.641
CLAUDIA...
COME ON!

20:08.675 --> 20:09.509
ALL THE WEST-COAST TRACKS
ARE STILL RUNNING.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.410
IF WE BET THE FAVORITES
ACROSS THE BOARD

20:10.443 --> 20:14.581
AND MAYBE BOX A SUPERFECTA,
WE CAN'T LOSE!

20:14.614 --> 20:17.884
BABY, I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.853
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.925
SEAN, I GOT BAD NEWS.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.727
I ACCIDENTALLY
BROKE YOUR TV.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.464
WHAT?
I WAS STANDING
WITH MY BEER NEAR THE TV.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.899
I LOOKED AT MY WATCH.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.833
YOU FOLLOW?

20:33.866 --> 20:36.803
I SPILLED BEER ALL OVER
THE TV. IT'S BROKEN.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.906
I BLAME MYSELF,
NOT CLAUDIA.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.941
EDDIE, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE KNOWS.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.545
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
THAT YOU POURED YOUR BEER
INTO THE TV.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.880
OH. ALL RIGHT, OK.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.983
SEE YOU LATER.
