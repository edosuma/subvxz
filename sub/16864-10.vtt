WEBVTT

00:00.944 --> 00:02.864
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:02.984 --> 00:06.201
Your heart's working at maybe 50% capacity.

00:06.321 --> 00:08.010
So why don't you just say it?
I'm a dead man.

00:08.131 --> 00:10.452
No, but you're gonna
have to give up working.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.187
I'm with Mickey now.

00:12.307 --> 00:14.478
And he is this close

00:14.598 --> 00:17.168
to getting Damian to change
his mid about his life path.

00:17.288 --> 00:20.604
We were thinking like a bike or
a jogging path in Pat's name.

00:20.724 --> 00:23.798
Not every guy who meets an
untimely end on his gig

00:23.866 --> 00:25.560
gets a public dedication, bro.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.770
I don't accept your amends,
and I do not forgive you.

00:28.838 --> 00:31.940
I want you to stay
away from me forever.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.376
So, from now on, fresh start.

00:34.443 --> 00:38.313
No booze, no grudges, and no Sheila.

00:38.381 --> 00:40.512
Get a job where you know
almost for a fact

00:40.562 --> 00:41.557
that you're gonna come home at night.

00:41.592 --> 00:44.586
In your line of work, there's no guarantee
you're gonna be here in 2 days from now.

00:44.654 --> 00:46.436
I don't know if I'm
really cut out for this.

00:46.556 --> 00:48.924
I mean, you want to get
out, it's your decision.

00:48.991 --> 00:50.792
You're saying you want me to stay?

00:50.860 --> 00:52.277
You know, it's up to you.

00:55.565 --> 00:56.831
I had a change of heart.

00:56.899 --> 00:58.058
Told you he'd be back.

00:58.178 --> 01:00.802
Listen, kid, this job is balls
out or no balls at all, all right?

01:00.870 --> 01:02.537
Yes. Balls to the wall.
Got it.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.004
All right, go get 'em.

01:07.243 --> 01:09.166
Lou! Come on!

01:09.286 --> 01:11.345
Come on, guys, we gotta go!

01:14.207 --> 01:16.284
I know, Dr. Klein, I know.

01:16.690 --> 01:21.289
But there's a huge canyon
between knowing something and

01:21.357 --> 01:25.193
accepting it. You know, it's
like as a living,

01:25.261 --> 01:31.037
breathing human person, I know
what reality is. But as a mother...

01:33.570 --> 01:39.395
As a mother, I think that...
I still think I see him walking around...

01:40.681 --> 01:44.253
You know, in the
neighborhood or at the store.

01:44.780 --> 01:48.098
I even sometimes think that I hear him
moving around the apartment.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.120
Ha! I know.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.157
I know, but I am getting better.
I'm keeping myself very busy. So...

01:57.560 --> 01:59.150
How am I doing on the blame?

01:59.270 --> 02:04.465
Ah, I still blame myself...
And him.

02:05.635 --> 02:07.140
Mostly him.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.406
No, no, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm joking.

02:11.474 --> 02:13.886
Listen, is it cold outside?

02:14.006 --> 02:17.018
Like, did you have to wear a
coat, or do I need a coat and a sweater?

02:17.815 --> 02:21.850
No. Dr. Klein, I'm not avoiding the issue.

02:21.917 --> 02:25.603
Damian chose to ride
the truck that night.

02:25.883 --> 02:29.174
He chose to join the fire department,

02:29.294 --> 02:31.102
so if I was to blame anybody, I...

02:31.518 --> 02:34.661
I'd blame that stupid baby that he saved
the week before the accident.

02:35.197 --> 02:40.504
Saving that baby is what sent him
over the moon about the job, so...

02:40.979 --> 02:45.602
No. I do not... I do not blame anybody.

02:46.809 --> 02:48.242
Right?

02:49.812 --> 02:51.479
Ooh! I gotta go.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.090
Yeah, OK, OK, OK.

02:53.210 --> 02:56.144
What is the... what's the
mantra for the day?

02:59.655 --> 03:01.389
It's not my fault.

03:04.126 --> 03:05.912
It's not my fault.

03:06.662 --> 03:08.622
It's not my fault.

03:13.202 --> 03:16.144
Ah, I can't believe how
well that works sometimes.

03:17.668 --> 03:19.233
Ha! I know, yes.

03:19.353 --> 03:20.809
Yes, same time tomorrow.

03:20.876 --> 03:23.744
Dr. Klein, thank you so much
for doing these phone sessions with me.

03:23.864 --> 03:26.161
You're really, like...
You're really saving my life.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.717
Yes.

03:28.784 --> 03:31.168
Ok. Ok, bye.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074

04:02.516 --> 04:05.420
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

04:05.488 --> 04:08.753
Traffic was a bitch.
I could have walked here faster.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.149
Hey, how was your, uh...

04:22.337 --> 04:24.349
Phone thing?

04:25.417 --> 04:27.960
Ok, you have got to stop...

04:29.119 --> 04:30.803
Beating yourself up about this.

04:30.923 --> 04:32.914
Jesus Christ, it's not your fault.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.553
I know, I know, I know.

04:35.673 --> 04:38.537
Ok, listen, I got you...

04:41.009 --> 04:42.141
Ok?

04:43.621 --> 04:44.809
"It's not your fault."

04:45.857 --> 04:50.145
Overcoming the blame game and
getting your life back on track.

04:51.528 --> 04:54.821
What, stupid? I knew it.
I shouldn't have.

04:54.941 --> 04:57.638
No. You went to a bookstore?

05:00.295 --> 05:02.516
What, it's impossible for
me to go into a book...

05:02.531 --> 05:04.145
You know, I read a lot of books.

05:04.213 --> 05:05.524
About baseball.

05:05.644 --> 05:08.122
No, no. Not just baseball.

05:09.385 --> 05:11.886
- Football, hockey...
- Uh-huh.

05:11.954 --> 05:14.322
Golf. Don't even play golf.
Never played golf.

05:14.711 --> 05:16.359
I've read, like, 6 books
about the Kennedys.

05:16.479 --> 05:18.956
I read that giant Mickey Mantle biography,

05:18.991 --> 05:20.198
which doesn't count as a baseball book

05:20.318 --> 05:21.796
because it was mostly about drinking.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.898
Ok, all right.

05:24.523 --> 05:27.302
I'm sorry. It was very nice
of you to get it for me.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.727
It was actually in the
magazine aisle

05:30.748 --> 05:33.365
at the supermarket, but I think it's a
pretty important book.

05:33.383 --> 05:36.012
It's got a quote from Dr. Oz on it, and I
think he's on "Oprah," right?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.265
Yes, he is on "Oprah."

05:37.544 --> 05:41.713
Ok. So... and I got the chicken
we were talking about, OK?

05:42.284 --> 05:45.016
And I got the protein powder
that Franco was telling me about.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.088
'Cause the protein thing's
working, right? The diet?

05:47.339 --> 05:50.971
Oh. You know, I've been so
frazzled, it's hard for me to tell,

05:51.091 --> 05:54.021
but I have got to get
going because I really, really,

05:54.071 --> 05:55.525
really want to catch that specialist.

05:55.568 --> 05:59.991
Hey, but I really... I want
you to read this book.

06:00.111 --> 06:02.737
I will. I promise you I'm
gonna read that book.

06:02.805 --> 06:04.135
All right.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.412
Has anybody heard from Mickey?

06:07.104 --> 06:10.513
Teddy said he saw him at a
meeting, which means, you know,

06:11.426 --> 06:12.747
he's not drinking.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.105
Couldn't happen to a nicer douchebag.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.348
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

06:18.854 --> 06:20.066
Hey.

06:20.689 --> 06:21.789
Handsome.

06:22.222 --> 06:25.924
I'm gonna go see a man about a
drug that's gonna help you walk again.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.071
Uncle Tommy's right over there, OK?

06:38.207 --> 06:44.168
All right, pal. I'm gonna make
your favorite chicken tuna thing.

âª On another day, c'mon, c'mon
with these ropes I tied, can we

06:55.858 --> 07:06.634
do no wrong now we grieve cause
now is gone things were good

07:06.702 --> 07:10.104
of a thousand men who
have come and gone

07:10.172 --> 07:14.809
now we grieve cause now
is gone things were good

07:14.877 --> 07:19.547
when we were young is it safe to say?
C'mon, c'mon

07:19.615 --> 07:21.215
was it right to leave?

07:21.283 --> 07:24.519
C'mon, c'mon will I ever learn?

07:24.587 --> 07:29.824
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon c'mon, c'mon âª

07:35.336 --> 07:37.864
Gentlemen, I got the official word.

07:37.932 --> 07:40.331
- You're a moron.
- Gonna ignore that.

07:40.451 --> 07:42.001
Why, because you can't
think of a good comeback?

07:42.069 --> 07:44.304
Oh, no, my friend, I
got a good comeback.

07:44.372 --> 07:46.377
- Let's hear it.
- Well, no, it's too late now.

07:46.497 --> 07:48.327
Oh, by all means, let
me cue you again.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.076
You're a moron.

07:50.144 --> 07:51.745
- Anyhow...
- Ha ha!

07:51.812 --> 07:55.315
Listen. The official word is this.
Tomorrow, Central Park

07:55.622 --> 07:59.938
will be the official unveiling of the
Patrick James Mahoney memorial pavilion.

08:00.058 --> 08:02.637
- Sweet. - Pat's mom... She wants, like, a
sunset ceremony,

08:02.669 --> 08:05.725
so I thought we'd head over there after
work, you know, show a sign of support.

08:05.793 --> 08:06.926
Yeah. Shit, yeah.

08:06.994 --> 08:08.695
Hell, I hope I get a
pavilion when I burn up.

08:08.763 --> 08:11.131
- A pavilion's the shit, man.
- A pavilion.

08:11.198 --> 08:12.526
What is a pavilion?

08:12.646 --> 08:14.901
I think it's some kind of building.

08:14.969 --> 08:18.638
No, no, no. I think it's sort
of like a Plaza, an open-air

08:18.706 --> 08:19.973
walkway kind of thing, you know?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.489
Nah, it's a building.
Fancy, big windows.

08:22.609 --> 08:24.043
Well, I'm glad you guys are
as confused as I am.

08:24.111 --> 08:26.216
'Cause when I first heard it, I thought
it was like a big number.

08:26.245 --> 08:28.114
You know, after a jillion
comes a pavilion.

08:28.182 --> 08:30.049
And with that, we have looped
all the way back to

08:30.117 --> 08:30.984
"you're a moron."

08:31.051 --> 08:34.453
First of all, young Einstein,
there's no such thing as a jillion.

08:34.522 --> 08:37.828
Not true. I went to High School
with a girl named Jillian.

08:38.225 --> 08:39.426
Nasty.

08:39.493 --> 08:43.763
Let you feel her up, blow your
socks off, just for a can of coke.

08:43.831 --> 08:47.700
Geez, imagine what you can get
for a 12-can refrigerator pack.

08:47.768 --> 08:50.367
Or if you had a pavilion cans.
Imagine that.

08:50.401 --> 08:51.701
So many cans...

08:51.739 --> 08:53.950
Ok, why we talking about pavilions?

08:54.070 --> 08:55.854
Well, because tomorrow after work,

08:55.974 --> 08:59.139
Pat Mahoney is getting a pavilion
named for him in Central Park.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.539
- We're all going down.
- Count me in.

09:01.563 --> 09:04.083
Oh, and by the way, I think that
we should bring Damian with us.

09:04.151 --> 09:07.123
- You think? - Yeah, but the kid's
in a chair, Sean... like fresh in a chair.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.222
But he's been in the house,
what, 2 months now?

09:09.290 --> 09:12.592
What Tommy's been saying,
Sheila's been on the kid day and night.

09:12.712 --> 09:14.290
Although, I gotta tell
you, I don't know how she's gonna feel

09:14.305 --> 09:16.863
about having this
motley crew rolling her

09:16.931 --> 09:19.699
not-so-bouncing baby boy into the
middle of goddamn Central Park.

09:19.819 --> 09:21.468
Come on, Lou, what could go wrong?

09:21.535 --> 09:25.138
Well, I mean, first thing, the
kid's sitting there like a statue.

09:25.206 --> 09:26.242
Uh-huh.

09:26.993 --> 09:28.258
- Pigeons.
- Oh!

09:28.378 --> 09:30.082
- Oh, man!
- Come on! - What?

09:30.202 --> 09:32.931
Seriously. Hey, come on.
This is about not forgetting our heroes.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.215
I mean, Damian's the hero as much
as the next guy. Is he not?

09:35.282 --> 09:37.584
- Right.
- I mean, we want to forget him? Come on.

09:37.651 --> 09:39.152
Maybe you're not such a moron.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.338
No, no, no, he's a moron,
but he makes a good point.

09:41.722 --> 09:43.302
Hey, guys. Unbelievable.

09:43.422 --> 09:45.113
- Pat's memorial?
- Tomorrow. I heard.

09:45.139 --> 09:50.245
You guys are not gonna guess who I saw.
You'll never guess in a million years.

09:50.365 --> 09:51.698
How about a pavilion years?

09:51.765 --> 09:52.765
You beat me to it.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.267
Mikey, who?

09:54.335 --> 09:57.426
Ok, so I go to this little bodega, right?

09:57.452 --> 10:00.290
And it's a bodega that
I don't actually usually go to, but

10:00.639 --> 10:02.475
- I went today.
- Spit it out, Mikey.- Get on with it.

10:02.543 --> 10:06.763
And I'm going down the aisle, and
I'm thinking about what I'm gonna get.

10:06.883 --> 10:09.036
Oh, my God.
What's with all the buildup, bro? Jesus!

10:09.081 --> 10:10.416
- What, dude? I'm...
- With a buildup like this,

10:10.484 --> 10:13.586
you better be telling us you saw
Angelina Jolie doing a 1-handed

10:13.654 --> 10:16.377
handstand in a short
skirt and no panties.

10:16.891 --> 10:17.824
I saw Mickey.

10:17.892 --> 10:20.493
Oh, shit, Mikey. Where's Tommy?
He's gonna want to hear this.

10:20.561 --> 10:22.362
He was in the bunk
room last time I saw.

10:22.429 --> 10:23.830
- You sure it was him?
- Yeah.

10:23.898 --> 10:26.032
- I mean, like, you talked to the guy?
- Yes.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.634
- What did he say?
- "Hi, Mike."

10:27.701 --> 10:29.836
- Oh, wow.
- Where was this?

10:29.904 --> 10:31.402
Like, 2 blocks away, Lou.

10:31.522 --> 10:34.108
Guy's got some set of balls, showing
his face in this neighborhood again.

10:34.228 --> 10:37.277
Yeah, guy's got some set of balls doing
what he did in the first place, you know?

10:37.344 --> 10:40.013
Hey, Lou.
Somebody's here to see you.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.782
- Maybe it's Mick.
- He ain't got balls that big.

10:43.116 --> 10:44.583
This guy says he's your doctor?

10:47.510 --> 10:51.524
Last time you were in my office,
didn't we talk about you retiring?

10:51.776 --> 10:55.869
Look, um, we just lost a guy
on our crew... a young kid.

10:56.764 --> 10:59.899
So right now, it's kind of all
has on deck,

10:59.967 --> 11:01.549
if you know what I mean.
For me to just walk away...

11:01.669 --> 11:03.603
Yeah, or crawl away,
which is more likely.

11:07.656 --> 11:11.258
Look, maybe a couple of months?
I..I..I don't know.

11:11.378 --> 11:13.613
You think I don't know
what you're up to?

11:13.681 --> 11:16.421
You have a department
physical coming up, right?

11:16.541 --> 11:19.145
A physical you are guaranteed not to pass.

11:19.382 --> 11:21.045
And you want me to get you off the hook,

11:21.506 --> 11:22.819
give you a clean bill of health,

11:23.424 --> 11:25.170
lie to the FDNY.

11:26.329 --> 11:29.128
- So you good with that?
- Oh, Christ.

11:29.196 --> 11:31.364
This is all I know how to do, doc.

11:31.656 --> 11:33.430
I don't fish. I don't golf.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.512
I fight fires.

11:36.951 --> 11:38.097
And I eat cake.

11:38.942 --> 11:42.392
So you take away the fires,
and I promise you,

11:43.118 --> 11:46.724
3 weeks, a month, tops,

11:47.958 --> 11:51.759
I will be dead
due to cake-related injuries.

11:53.698 --> 11:55.123
Can you live with that?

11:56.887 --> 12:02.531
If I lie for you and you die
in a fire and some

12:02.713 --> 12:05.513
or all of your beloved crew dies trying
to save you,

12:07.119 --> 12:08.436
can you live with that?

12:11.467 --> 12:12.972
Enjoy your cake.

12:17.011 --> 12:19.145
- Hey!
- Shh!

12:19.213 --> 12:20.494
Ok.

12:25.649 --> 12:27.553
- Dad.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.474
Can you help me with my essay?

12:30.348 --> 12:32.827
Uh, sure, honey, just give me
2 seconds. I just want to...

12:32.857 --> 12:35.200
Yeah, well, mom said you knew
a lot about the Vietnam war,

12:35.216 --> 12:37.075
and that's what it's on
and it's due tomorrow.

12:37.195 --> 12:38.863
Expert on the Vietnam war.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.933
2 seconds. Ok?

12:41.311 --> 12:42.275
Yeah.

12:42.736 --> 12:43.915
Hey!

12:45.617 --> 12:46.987
You missed the meeting.

12:48.677 --> 12:51.778
Last night, you said you'd take me
to the St. Celia Tuesday night AA meeting?

12:51.845 --> 12:54.781
- Oh!
- And I waited, and now it's too late.

12:54.848 --> 12:57.125
Oh, shit! I totally forgot.

12:57.809 --> 13:00.142
Really?
I never would have guessed.

13:01.807 --> 13:03.595
Oh, boy.

13:05.025 --> 13:06.392
She's pissed, huh?

13:06.460 --> 13:10.630
Yeah? Well, we're all pissed,
except for Wyatt,

13:10.698 --> 13:12.603
and that's only because he's a baby.

13:12.723 --> 13:15.001
Although I'm sure his little
sponge brain is already

13:15.069 --> 13:17.397
soaking up the disappointment, broken
promises,

13:17.432 --> 13:19.986
and general A.D.D. malaise
that is Tommy Gavin.

13:20.106 --> 13:21.407
What's that supposed to mean?

13:21.475 --> 13:22.909
- Dad.
- Yeah.

13:23.029 --> 13:25.608
- Vietnam?
- Two minutes, honey. Okay?

13:29.574 --> 13:32.366
What? What is that... what
was that thing you said?

13:32.754 --> 13:36.147
The malaise? Oh, that's just a
fancy-ass way of saying bullshit.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.857
Ok, no. The other thing.

13:38.202 --> 13:41.694
A.D.D. You, Tommy, have emotional A.D.D.

13:41.762 --> 13:44.764
Ok, you keep promising the world to your
children and to your wife,

13:44.832 --> 13:47.443
and then you spend half of your
waking hours

13:47.563 --> 13:49.491
spoon-feeding your brain-damaged godson

13:49.611 --> 13:52.918
and giving emotional support to your
ex-girlfriend.

13:53.463 --> 13:55.712
I mean, you missed 3 dinners this week.

13:55.832 --> 13:59.512
And right now, you were supposed
to be at the St. Celia CYC AA.

13:59.794 --> 14:02.229
Ok, not to mention
the FDNY thing,

14:02.349 --> 14:06.219
the P.A.L. thing, and the PTA thing... all
of which you missed last week.

14:06.625 --> 14:11.668
Tommy, you promised me that you would
be focused here at home on us.

14:11.788 --> 14:14.842
But no, you are so
busy trying to save

14:14.879 --> 14:18.957
the goddamn world, rescuing people from
fires, from cars,

14:19.077 --> 14:21.982
Sheila, Damian, every other goddamn soul
on this planet,

14:22.011 --> 14:23.665
except your own goddamn family.

14:24.839 --> 14:26.286
I mean, it's like you have OCD,

14:26.406 --> 14:29.308
except instead of germs, you're
obsessed with saving strangers.

14:29.596 --> 14:31.062
You know, when it comes to Sheila...

14:31.182 --> 14:33.205
Have you thought about
PTSD when it comes to her?

14:33.242 --> 14:35.866
Honey, I told you, I got tested.
She got tested...

14:35.923 --> 14:38.991
PTSD... post-traumatic
stress disorder, Tommy.

14:39.014 --> 14:40.585
And thank you for that visual.

14:40.948 --> 14:45.178
Ok. I don't know. Maybe I do have A.D.D.

14:45.298 --> 14:48.308
and CBS and NHL,

14:48.428 --> 14:50.129
the LPA. I don't know.

14:50.459 --> 14:54.857
I'm just one guy, you
know, with one family.

14:54.907 --> 14:57.337
No. With 2 families.

14:58.075 --> 15:01.443
Ok. 2 families. You know...

15:05.027 --> 15:07.980
Ok, has Mickey resurfaced yet?

15:09.466 --> 15:11.693
A couple of the guys saw him,
but he's not helping out.

15:11.813 --> 15:13.290
He's not involved. He doesn't know...

15:13.905 --> 15:17.020
Ok, so Damian and your girlfriend
are now your responsibility.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.392
Jesus Christ. It's not my girlfriend.

15:19.459 --> 15:21.566
This is not a girlfriend thing.
This is a family thing.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.787
Listen, if I'd never slept with her

15:23.907 --> 15:26.032
and this had happened to Damian,
wouldn't you expect me to be doing

15:26.099 --> 15:27.378
exactly what I'm doing
just for Jimmy's sake?

15:27.498 --> 15:28.930
- Yes, yes.
- Ok, see?

15:28.981 --> 15:31.387
Yes, but you did sleep with her,
and that is the difference.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.796
Look, Katy has a dance recital
tomorrow night,

15:36.916 --> 15:39.618
and Colleen has her 50th meeting in 50 days.

15:40.062 --> 15:41.627
You need to be there for both.

15:44.918 --> 15:46.449
Jesus Christ.

15:48.789 --> 15:51.557
- Dad.
- Vietnam, right.

15:51.625 --> 15:52.758
What have you got so far?

15:52.826 --> 15:56.161
Ok, I have that once we got
in, we couldn't get out.

15:56.281 --> 16:00.323
And both sides dug their heels in
and neither one would let up any ground.

16:00.658 --> 16:03.240
And that's basically
the main idea, right?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.372
- Don't I know it.
- What?

16:07.385 --> 16:10.807
We're talking American history here.

16:13.016 --> 16:17.046
So you're gonna be with him at
this pavilion hoosie-whatsie, right?

16:17.166 --> 16:18.108
Yeah.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.164
Then I shouldn't worry.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.990
I mean, I would go. It's just that I really
want to catch this specialist, you know.

16:25.110 --> 16:28.144
It's like he's only here one week out of
every year.

16:28.264 --> 16:29.231
Yeah.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.635
Listen, it'll do him some good to be out
of the house. You know what I mean?

16:33.960 --> 16:37.787
I guess. Besides, you know what,
you've gotta drive the van.

16:37.907 --> 16:40.809
It's not that I don't trust the guys.
It's just that honestly,

16:40.877 --> 16:44.486
that van cost more than
all of them put together.

16:44.606 --> 16:49.137
Ok, I am the only person who will be driving
the van. I guarantee you that. Ok?

16:49.811 --> 16:53.723
So this specialist, he has got
a clinic in Zurich.

16:53.843 --> 16:57.926
And he is into this whole alternative
form of therapy.

16:58.046 --> 17:02.631
And it's wicked expensive, but he says
that the proteins are great.

17:02.699 --> 17:05.806
He just wants to add some injectable
steroids and then

17:05.925 --> 17:08.032
a series of blood supplements.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.400
And it's 25 grand a month.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.970
But he has got a

17:14.089 --> 17:17.837
patient in Sweden who's getting
the circulation feeling back in his legs.

17:18.898 --> 17:21.316
Yeah, 'cause he's sitting
on an empty wallet.

17:24.262 --> 17:25.674
25 grand.

17:26.536 --> 17:28.256
A lot of money.

17:28.324 --> 17:29.828
I don't care what it costs.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.916
- No, I know. I know.
- I want Damian to walk again.

17:33.036 --> 17:34.698
Right. Right.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.171
Hey, you're reading...
this, huh?

17:43.239 --> 17:45.173
What? Oh, yeah. I have.

17:45.241 --> 17:47.342
You know, I really love those
self-help books.

17:47.410 --> 17:50.178
I feel like no matter what they have
to offer with, like, either,

17:50.246 --> 17:53.025
you know, weight or
quit smoking or grief,

17:53.332 --> 17:55.595
they do have something
to offer that's worth it.

17:55.715 --> 17:58.110
And I think that's why they sell so well.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.677
Yeah. To chicks.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.092
You've never read a self-help book?

18:04.160 --> 18:10.547
I read "How to Throw a Football"
by Johnny Unitas when I was, like, 12.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.491
And then again
when I was, like, 35

18:14.003 --> 18:18.155
when Damian and I joined that
flag football league.

18:19.422 --> 18:21.685
Jimmy used to call it
"fag football" league.

18:21.805 --> 18:25.313
It was pretty faggy, which is
why I threw, like, 48

18:25.381 --> 18:28.183
touchdown passes when I was playing
quarterback that year.

18:30.934 --> 18:36.480
Listen, I really appreciate you've been
doing for the both of us. It's been...

18:36.510 --> 18:39.990
Don't mention it. You don't have to say anything
about that.

18:40.942 --> 18:44.574
Jimmy's definitely looking down
and he sees what a good

18:44.694 --> 18:47.619
- man and friend... best friend...
- You don't have to say it.

18:47.739 --> 18:50.038
You are being, unlike Mickey.

18:50.106 --> 18:52.224
- Douchebag.
- Mm-hmm.

18:54.385 --> 18:55.844
What did he say, exactly?

18:56.326 --> 18:58.198
He said some very hurtful things.

18:59.289 --> 19:00.315
He couldn't handle it.

19:00.736 --> 19:03.264
No. You know what, just don't
get me started, all right?

19:03.277 --> 19:06.529
What I want to say is that I really...

19:06.649 --> 19:08.470
Those things I said to you
about hating you, I just was...

19:08.590 --> 19:12.878
No, no, no, no, listen. Forget about that.
I know.

19:12.998 --> 19:14.229
You don't hate me. You don't blame me.

19:14.297 --> 19:15.363
I blame myself.

19:15.666 --> 19:18.211
No, you shouldn't. It was me.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.143
I was the one that talked him
into being a firefighter.

19:20.172 --> 19:22.737
Did he want to do it, yeah.
But you know, I

19:22.805 --> 19:24.913
pushed him in that direction,
you know, so...

19:25.033 --> 19:26.338
Yes, but I should have

19:26.458 --> 19:28.797
done more of the, like, reverse
psychology thing and kept

19:28.917 --> 19:31.405
telling him that I wanted
him to be a firefighter.

19:31.434 --> 19:32.858
The reverse psychology
thing is ridiculous.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.510
That was never gonna work, no.
It was...

19:35.013 --> 19:36.535
You know, he wanted to go back on the rig,

19:36.566 --> 19:39.235
but I urged him.
I shouldn't have done it, you know.

19:39.562 --> 19:41.825
Yeah, and you shouldn't have
shown him his father's badge.

19:46.529 --> 19:48.363
Are you talking about the
badge that you gave me

19:48.431 --> 19:51.133
specifically to save and keep for him?

19:51.451 --> 19:53.994
The one to keep the hell
out of my house? Yes.

19:55.254 --> 19:57.339
The house you suffocated him in.

20:02.136 --> 20:03.323
What is it, honey?

20:03.980 --> 20:05.180
Are you OK?

20:05.248 --> 20:06.970
What? Give him a drink.

20:07.683 --> 20:11.253
- Here, here.
- See if you can get it, Damian.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.420
Come on.

20:12.488 --> 20:14.089
- Yeah, a little more.
- Whoa!

20:14.157 --> 20:15.190
Ha ha ha!

20:15.258 --> 20:16.825
Wow!

20:16.893 --> 20:18.326
Yeah!

20:18.394 --> 20:19.498
Look at that.

20:20.796 --> 20:22.197
Goddamn Mickey.

20:22.265 --> 20:23.498
Rat bastard.

20:23.566 --> 20:25.433
You want to blame somebody...

20:25.501 --> 20:27.249
He's the guy to point the finger at!

20:27.737 --> 20:28.904
Scumbag.

20:28.971 --> 20:29.838
Hello.

20:29.906 --> 20:31.682
I'm gonna start drinking again.

20:32.675 --> 20:34.417
Coll, where are you?

20:34.844 --> 20:37.779
Hey. You didn't start
drinking again, did you?

20:37.847 --> 20:38.847
Not yet.

20:38.915 --> 20:40.148
Good. Thank God.

20:40.216 --> 20:41.883
Look at this cart.
I mean, this would only work for our

20:41.951 --> 20:42.918
family if we were midgets.

20:42.985 --> 20:45.020
Yeah, or normal.
What's the story?

20:45.087 --> 20:47.614
I'm just picking out
all my old favorites.

20:47.935 --> 20:49.558
Oh, this is my favorite. Oh, my gosh.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.114
It goes down so clean and smooth.

20:52.234 --> 20:54.237
But, I don't have to tell you that.

20:56.403 --> 20:57.730
Hello, you.

20:58.234 --> 21:02.204
Oh, you and I were best friends once.
Good-bye.

21:02.271 --> 21:05.173
Don't kiss the bottle.
Goddamn, what's up?

21:05.709 --> 21:08.176
Here's the deal.
You were supposed to be my sponsor,

21:08.244 --> 21:10.745
which was a stupid idea to begin with
and even more idiotic

21:10.813 --> 21:14.649
now that I realize that in trying to do 90
meetings in 90 days,

21:14.717 --> 21:18.286
out of the 49 I've hit so far, you've only
been with me for 10 of them.

21:18.354 --> 21:22.739
No. One-zero. Ok, and every time
I try to call you

21:22.859 --> 21:25.560
to talk about booze or an urge to drink or
something about recovery

21:25.628 --> 21:28.428
that I desperately need to know, you
not only don't pick up,

21:28.475 --> 21:30.031
you don't even call me back or text me.

21:30.099 --> 21:32.801
Honey, I can't text.
My fingers are too big. I tried

21:32.868 --> 21:35.103
typing in "what's going on,"
and it sends out a text saying

21:35.171 --> 21:37.505
"who's blowing Juan?"
I can't do it.

21:37.573 --> 21:40.575
Here's the thing. I don't even want to drink
this stuff right now.

21:40.643 --> 21:42.277
That's good, honey.

21:42.345 --> 21:44.145
I just wanted to see how fast
you'd get down here

21:44.213 --> 21:45.630
if I lit a fire under your ass.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.850
You know I have a lot of stuff
going on, OK?

21:48.918 --> 21:51.186
I'm trying to juggle everything
at work and at home.

21:51.254 --> 21:52.887
Meaning Damian.

21:52.955 --> 21:53.722
He's crippled.

21:53.789 --> 21:56.680
So am I, by a disease
I inherited from you!

21:56.800 --> 21:58.493
Shh! Keep it down.

21:58.561 --> 21:59.956
My 50th meeting is tonight.

22:00.076 --> 22:03.764
Ok? And I'd really like my
sponsor to be there. On time!

22:09.405 --> 22:10.939
Hey, sorry, man.

22:11.007 --> 22:12.525
I got so much...

22:13.796 --> 22:15.138
Been here about 20 minutes.

22:25.088 --> 22:26.337
Hi, Chief.

22:27.865 --> 22:28.857
Hi, Tom.

22:30.077 --> 22:32.256
Can you guys give Tom and me a
minute or two here, please?

22:32.954 --> 22:34.267
Sure, yeah, no problem.

22:47.510 --> 22:49.034
I brought these for you.

22:50.710 --> 22:52.444
"Cam Neely's Greatest Hockey Hits"...

22:55.685 --> 22:57.215
And "Friends of Eddie Coyle."

23:00.003 --> 23:02.238
I should have gotten them back
to you a long time ago, you know...

23:03.146 --> 23:05.912
I know how crazy you are
about your Robert Mitchum collection.

23:06.841 --> 23:07.861
And?

23:12.922 --> 23:14.084
That's it? He's leaving?

23:14.141 --> 23:15.904
Oh, I had a sawbuck on
him kicking your ass.

23:15.971 --> 23:17.273
Go back into the kitchen.

23:17.393 --> 23:18.552
Hey!

23:24.684 --> 23:26.556
You got something you want
to say to me, tough guy?

23:37.849 --> 23:39.204
Get in there!

23:39.695 --> 23:41.942
You heard me!
Get the hell back in there!

23:45.174 --> 23:46.249
All right.

23:46.585 --> 23:48.945
We can stand here all morning knocking
the snot out of each other,

23:49.065 --> 23:52.533
or you can shut your goddamn yap for 2
seconds and listen to what I gotta say.

23:54.137 --> 23:58.160
Unless you're gonna say you're
a gutless, spineless,

23:58.280 --> 24:00.997
no balls pussy, I don't want to hear it.

24:01.117 --> 24:05.019
I'd rather just keep doing this.
At least I get some satisfaction out of it.

24:05.087 --> 24:07.455
All right.
Is that what you want to hear?

24:07.523 --> 24:08.695
Yeah.

24:09.447 --> 24:15.663
All right. I'm a no-good,
gutless, spineless pussy, OK,

24:15.731 --> 24:18.970
who abandoned his girlfriend and
a paralyzed kid

24:19.090 --> 24:22.071
because I'm just a self-centered
goddamn asshole!

24:22.770 --> 24:24.055
Does that about cover it?

24:26.008 --> 24:27.218
Yeah.

24:29.712 --> 24:30.745
Did you guys hear that?

24:30.813 --> 24:34.373
Yep! Actually, that last
part was a little garbled.

24:36.452 --> 24:39.053
The trouble is, fellas,
we only bet the physical

24:39.121 --> 24:42.584
confrontation, so there's some
money kind of hanging in the balance.

24:43.559 --> 24:44.660
Come here.

24:45.289 --> 24:46.995
I want you guys to hear this.

24:49.847 --> 24:51.635
You want to know why I left Sheila?

24:52.340 --> 24:55.693
It's not because I'm a coward or I'm a
pussy or I suck like this guy's telling you.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.230
It's because I couldn't take it anymore.

24:57.766 --> 24:59.441
All right, she's wasting her whole life,

24:59.508 --> 25:05.644
all her energy, her time, her money, her
hope on a string of quacks!

25:05.687 --> 25:10.746
Endless. Pills, protein powders,
injections, aqua acupuncture.

25:10.797 --> 25:12.520
What is that? I don't know.

25:12.588 --> 25:14.629
She's going for every bit of
it hook, line, and sinker.

25:14.749 --> 25:17.367
So I try to tell her. You know, I was just
trying to tell her the truth...

25:17.390 --> 25:19.284
What this guy should
be telling her and everybody else,

25:19.661 --> 25:22.857
which is Damian
ain't ever walking again.

25:25.667 --> 25:28.009
He is as is. Done.

25:30.423 --> 25:31.736
So she told me to take a hike.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.212
I didn't come down here to tell
you guys

25:36.332 --> 25:39.076
that it took a lot of balls
to tell her that... the truth.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.829
But I'm here to say it took
a little bit of balls.

25:42.975 --> 25:46.077
And if any of yous had any,
you'd tell her the same thing...

25:46.803 --> 25:47.977
Soon.

25:53.329 --> 25:54.725
Be safe.

26:00.336 --> 26:03.304
Well, always good to see Mick.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.058
It's a shitter.

26:24.126 --> 26:25.081
What?
What are you talking about?

26:25.124 --> 26:28.405
The Patrick James Mahoney
memorial pavilion is a comfort station.

26:28.525 --> 26:29.828
- In other words...
- A crapper?

26:29.948 --> 26:31.022
- Yeah.
- How the hell did this happen?

26:31.142 --> 26:33.983
Hey. Didn't start yet, right?

26:34.235 --> 26:36.452
Sorry. Couldn't get the ramp
back in the van.

26:36.572 --> 26:38.744
The van cost an arm and a leg
and it didn't have an automatic...

26:39.344 --> 26:40.280
Ramp... Um...

26:41.009 --> 26:41.743
What's wrong?

26:41.810 --> 26:43.845
Well, they decided to honor
Patrick James Mahoney,

26:43.912 --> 26:45.279
- our fallen brother...
- A hero.

26:45.347 --> 26:46.703
With a shit pavilion.

26:47.416 --> 26:48.935
I don't know.
Looks pretty good to me.

26:49.055 --> 26:51.052
Not in form, in function.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.220
They got his name on a plaque.

26:52.287 --> 26:54.122
Go ahead.
Go look behind that blue curtain.

26:54.189 --> 26:55.690
It's a crapatorium, Tom.

26:55.758 --> 26:58.926
- A turd temple. A boo-boo barn.
- A fudge hole.

26:58.994 --> 27:00.361
Yeah, you know, we need a
guy in a suit right now.

27:00.429 --> 27:02.263
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah, can I help you?

27:02.331 --> 27:04.932
Yeah, we're FDNY.
Listen, we're just trying to figure out

27:05.000 --> 27:07.335
why the city decided to honor
our brother with a restroom.

27:07.402 --> 27:09.370
Yeah, the guy gets cancer working
down at ground zero,

27:09.438 --> 27:12.573
and you guys think that this
is a... that this is... fits?

27:12.641 --> 27:15.030
- That this is...
- Appropriate?

27:15.883 --> 27:17.211
No. That ain't it, dude.

27:17.279 --> 27:18.912
Are any of you members
of the Mahoney family?

27:19.032 --> 27:21.816
- Not technically, no, but, Jesus...
- Look, the family was given a

27:21.884 --> 27:23.184
list of possible naming options.

27:23.252 --> 27:24.485
This is the one they chose.

27:24.553 --> 27:26.354
They wanted a Central Park pavilion.

27:26.421 --> 27:29.190
Well, were they made aware the
pavilion in this case means outhouse?

27:29.258 --> 27:31.092
Look, guys, your friend is
being honored here today,

27:31.160 --> 27:33.041
whether you believe it or not.
Just go with the flow.

27:33.161 --> 27:36.030
Hey, problem is, the flow
is full of feces, pal.

27:36.098 --> 27:38.633
You know, this is a slap in the
goddamn face is what it is.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.435
Pat Mahoney was no different than the men
who died when those towers came down.

27:41.503 --> 27:43.771
He's dead because he was working
such long hours on that

27:43.839 --> 27:46.474
cancerous pile of shit.
So, what, you didn't have a urinal

27:46.542 --> 27:49.076
to offer the guy?
Something smaller, more insignificant?

27:49.144 --> 27:50.912
You want to make a scene, tough guys?
How about I bring

27:50.961 --> 27:52.970
Mr. Mahoney's mother over here so you can
ruin this day for her?

27:52.987 --> 27:53.948
Would that make you happy?

27:54.016 --> 27:55.483
Thanks for nothing, pal.
We appreciate it.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.951
- Thanks, buddy.
- Have a good day, asshole.

27:57.019 --> 27:57.785
What a dick.

27:57.853 --> 27:59.294
What's going on?
What's the ruckus?

27:59.337 --> 28:00.321
Hey, where the hell you been?

28:00.389 --> 28:02.623
I had a long walk from the car.
I had to take a leak.

28:02.691 --> 28:05.059
Well, you didn't do
it in there, did you?

28:05.127 --> 28:07.495
What? What? No, I whipped my
dick out in front of the crowd

28:07.563 --> 28:08.729
and did a little pissing dance.

28:08.797 --> 28:09.797
What are you talking about?

28:09.865 --> 28:12.200
Lou, you just took a
leak in Pat's pavilion.

28:12.267 --> 28:14.535
No, I took a leak at Pat's pavilion.

28:14.603 --> 28:15.924
No, dude, in.

28:16.238 --> 28:18.417
Pat Mahoney's pavilion
is a public shitter.

28:19.308 --> 28:20.467
- You're kidding me.
- Nah.

28:20.587 --> 28:24.312
Jesus Christ. I thought the
pavilion was this whole kind of

28:24.379 --> 28:29.550
area out here, therefore, the
shitter was pavilion-adjacent.

28:29.618 --> 28:32.920
Oh, Christ.
I gotta talk to the family.

28:32.988 --> 28:35.486
- The family doesn't need to know.
- No, I really gotta talk to them.

28:35.606 --> 28:37.763
In other words...
You didn't... don't tell me that you...

28:37.883 --> 28:40.494
Oh, Jesus. Lou dropped the
deuce in Pat's memorial.

28:40.562 --> 28:41.762
Come on, Lou!

28:41.830 --> 28:45.066
Guys, I had a huge lunch,
and it had to be tacos.

28:45.133 --> 28:46.067
Ohh!

28:46.134 --> 28:48.369
- You know, I gotta get out of here.
- Why? Where you going?

28:48.437 --> 28:50.905
I'm not gonna stand here and
watch a good man be insulted this way.

28:50.973 --> 28:53.007
Franc, I'm sorry, it was tacos.
It wasn't me.

28:53.127 --> 28:54.651
And I'm not talking about you, Lou.

28:54.771 --> 28:56.314
I just, I refuse to believe

28:56.434 --> 28:58.776
that a man gives his life doing his job,
doing it well...

28:58.896 --> 29:00.081
And this is the way he's remembered.

29:00.148 --> 29:02.083
You know, it ain't right.

29:02.150 --> 29:03.584
Pat deserves better, much better.

29:03.652 --> 29:05.286
You know what, you're right.
He does.

29:05.354 --> 29:06.587
How do you mean?

29:06.655 --> 29:07.900
All right, I tell you what.

29:08.557 --> 29:11.726
Here, take my keys.
You and Mikey go to my car. In the back,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.060
in the trunk there's a toolbox.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.062
Get it, bring it over here, pronto.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.664
- I like the sound of that.
- Yeah, yeah, you know what?

29:16.732 --> 29:18.065
It sounds great.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.780
Pulling it off is not
gonna be so easy.

29:22.571 --> 29:23.371
Yeah.

29:23.438 --> 29:25.640
Where are you?
The meeting's in 15 minutes.

29:25.707 --> 29:27.742
I'm at an FDNY thing in the
middle of Central Park.

29:27.809 --> 29:28.945
You know what, just forget it.

29:29.065 --> 29:30.678
- Are you home?
- No, I'm at the church.

29:30.746 --> 29:32.613
And mom is home waiting for you
to pick her up at the house

29:32.681 --> 29:34.582
- for Katy's dancing.
- Which is when?

29:34.650 --> 29:36.684
You've got to be at the
school in an hour and a half.

29:36.752 --> 29:38.519
Well, you know what, maybe I'll
swing by the meeting

29:38.587 --> 29:39.954
- on way over to the...
- You know what? Don't sweat it.

29:40.022 --> 29:42.089
I've already found
another sponsor.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.235
Who?

29:43.725 --> 29:45.159
Me, asshole!

29:45.227 --> 29:47.428
You might have backpacked her
back into sobriety, but I'll be

29:47.496 --> 29:49.263
in charge of her confirmation.

29:49.331 --> 29:51.866
Now get your no-good ass home and
take my other favorite niece

29:51.934 --> 29:54.598
to her dance bullshit! Now!

29:59.775 --> 30:02.436
Hey, I gotta take off.
Here's the keys to the van.

30:02.490 --> 30:04.345
I need you to watch it and Damian, OK?

30:04.413 --> 30:07.381
I'm gonna get your keys from the morons,
and I'm gonna borrow your car, all right?

30:07.449 --> 30:08.182
All right, all right.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.817
And after we're done here,
I'll bring him home.

30:09.885 --> 30:11.652
No, no. I gotta take him home.
Ok, so, I'll call and

30:11.720 --> 30:14.021
check in with you later to find
out where you are, come pick him up.

30:14.089 --> 30:15.544
- What am I supposed to do with him?
- I don't know.

30:15.837 --> 30:17.164
Take him dancing.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.529
And so, it's with great pride
and with the great appreciation

30:21.596 --> 30:24.478
of the city of New York for his
many years of service

30:24.598 --> 30:28.208
that we dedicate the Patrick
James Mahoney pavilion.

30:51.460 --> 30:52.798
Ah...

31:50.552 --> 31:51.779
Hmm.

31:54.423 --> 31:57.058
Ahem. Yes.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.927
Now, this... this is a goddamn pavilion.

31:59.995 --> 32:01.429
Yeah? You gonna take
a shit here, too?

32:01.496 --> 32:03.297
Yeah, this looks good, Lou.

32:03.365 --> 32:05.566
But you know it ain't gonna last.
They're gonna take this down, bro.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.035
I'd like to see 'em try.
I used my homemade ninja glue to

32:08.103 --> 32:09.837
put this thing up. They want to
take it down,

32:09.905 --> 32:11.872
they're gonna have to knock
the whole goddamn wall down.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.274
Yeah, well, apparently you
never heard that old saying

32:13.341 --> 32:14.308
"you can't beat City Hall."

32:14.376 --> 32:16.210
What's the point of doing this
if nobody knows it's here?

32:16.278 --> 32:18.012
Hey, we know it's here.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.381
And Pat knows, wherever he is.

32:20.449 --> 32:21.348
It's good enough for me.

32:21.416 --> 32:24.051
Guys!
I think security's coming!

32:24.119 --> 32:26.080
All right, gentlemen, let's celebrate.

33:22.817 --> 33:24.619
- Yeah.
- Where's my son?

33:24.795 --> 33:26.588
- What?
- I come home and my son

33:26.708 --> 33:28.322
is nowhere to be found.

33:28.390 --> 33:29.824
How long was the thing in the park?

33:29.891 --> 33:31.459
Just got out. Just got out.

33:31.526 --> 33:33.250
So then, you're on your way home?

33:33.305 --> 33:35.812
Yeah, yeah, but there's a
shitload of traffic

33:35.932 --> 33:37.134
so it's gonna take a while.

33:37.254 --> 33:38.699
Ok, well, listen...

33:39.272 --> 33:40.864
There's this,

33:40.984 --> 33:42.170
like, seminar thing

33:42.179 --> 33:44.672
where this expert is
gonna talk about paralysis and

33:44.739 --> 33:47.908
regenerative movement, and I
really, really want to go.

33:47.976 --> 33:49.952
You go.
You need to go to that.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.814
Thank you. Ooh!
Let me say hi to Damian.

33:53.882 --> 33:56.584
Well, the thing is, I'm
driving, so it's not... it's

33:56.651 --> 33:58.457
against the law now to talk
on a cell phone while you're driving.

33:58.485 --> 33:59.758
I shouldn't be talking to you right now.

33:59.878 --> 34:01.364
Yeah, I would like him to hear my voice.

34:02.426 --> 34:04.019
Alright, here we go, here he is.

34:05.066 --> 34:09.643
Hey, sweetie! Did you have fun
with the guys in the park?

34:10.147 --> 34:12.061
Did you miss your old ma?

34:21.717 --> 34:22.842
Happy now?

34:22.911 --> 34:24.251
I think he answered me.

34:24.371 --> 34:26.286
Did you hear that?
He's never done that before.

34:26.406 --> 34:28.329
That must be the protein. I think that the
protein's working.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.521
Do you think it's protein?

34:29.818 --> 34:31.663
Nah. I wouldn't put too much
on the protein.

34:31.681 --> 34:34.092
Look, there's a cop up ahead.
I gotta go. Ok?

34:35.190 --> 34:36.661
Goddamn it.

34:42.869 --> 34:44.442
Hey, shithead, where the hell are you?

34:44.562 --> 34:47.498
Hey. Well, Damian didn't want to
go dancing, so we took him to the bar.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.235
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

34:49.304 --> 34:50.504
Hey, just relax, will you?

34:50.572 --> 34:52.172
We're not feeding him drinks.

34:52.239 --> 34:55.234
We're feeding him beer nuts, and
we're feeding him pretzels, but no drinks.

34:55.291 --> 34:58.183
Don't put anything in his mouth!
Goddamn it!

34:58.303 --> 35:00.457
All right, all right, hold on a second.
He's trying to...

35:00.577 --> 35:02.566
He wants to tell you something.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.045
Spit it out, Damian.

35:04.282 --> 35:06.519
Uh, yeah, he says you're an asshole.

35:06.855 --> 35:07.922
Yeah, you're a regular riot.

35:07.989 --> 35:09.998
I'm gonna be there in
10 minutes, asshole.

35:10.292 --> 35:12.032
You're looking good, buddy.

35:12.605 --> 35:14.428
Ah, Dame.

35:14.496 --> 35:15.641
What do you think he's thinking, Matt?

35:15.907 --> 35:17.569
I don't know. Nothing?

35:17.890 --> 35:20.265
Or maybe he's having a great time.
How would you know?

35:20.635 --> 35:23.170
Yeah, I don't know.
I just thought maybe one brain-damaged

35:23.238 --> 35:25.642
individual might give us some
insight into the thoughts of another.

35:25.661 --> 35:26.974
Ha ha ha!

35:27.042 --> 35:27.952
Another what?

35:28.702 --> 35:30.225
Check, please!

35:30.580 --> 35:34.381
Guys, I'm sorry.
Like, I don't mean to sound mean or

35:34.449 --> 35:37.418
insensitive or anything, but I
think it's really weird that we

35:37.485 --> 35:38.416
have him hanging around like this.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.753
Look at him. he's fine.

35:39.821 --> 35:41.021
He likes it.

35:41.089 --> 35:42.289
Is he OK?

35:42.357 --> 35:45.693
Well, actually, he's paralyzed,
and he's got a little

35:45.760 --> 35:47.027
bit of brain damage, too.

35:47.095 --> 35:48.324
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

35:48.444 --> 35:49.930
Was he in a car accident or something?

35:50.050 --> 35:51.705
No. He was a firefighter.

35:51.825 --> 35:52.933
We're all firefighters.

35:53.001 --> 35:55.469
He was on our crew.
It happened on a call, a big fire.

35:55.537 --> 35:57.752
- Do you guys still hang out with him?
- Yeah.

35:57.872 --> 35:59.221
Oh, that's sweet.

36:00.479 --> 36:04.778
Yeah, well, you know, hey, once a brother,
always a brother, right?

36:04.846 --> 36:06.814
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm Franco, by the way.

36:06.881 --> 36:08.349
- This is Sean.
- Hi.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.184
- Hi.
- Black Shawn here.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.385
And this right here is Damey-Dame.
Damian, actually.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.936
And this one... whatever.

36:15.056 --> 36:15.923
Mike.

36:17.396 --> 36:19.869
So you guys take care of him ***?

36:19.989 --> 36:21.076
Yeah. Yeah.

36:21.496 --> 36:23.097
I mean, I feed him.

36:23.164 --> 36:24.765
Oh, that's so great.

36:24.833 --> 36:28.226
I'm gonna go outside and wait for Tom...
And maybe puke.

36:29.148 --> 36:32.250
I have to stay and see how low
the crowded elevator's gonna go.

36:32.370 --> 36:34.513
And you know, I dress him.

36:34.633 --> 36:40.047
- And I wash him, and I
bathe him, as it were. - Seriously?

36:40.115 --> 36:42.416
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, most of him.
I do his torso, arms,

36:42.484 --> 36:44.918
legs, face. Try to avoid the groin.
That's a little gay.

36:44.986 --> 36:47.367
- We'll leave that to Mike.
- Ha ha! - He's kidding.

36:47.487 --> 36:49.058
So, you don't help take care of him?

36:49.178 --> 36:50.636
Yeah, yeah, sure, I do.

36:50.756 --> 36:52.271
What do you do?

36:52.508 --> 36:57.019
Uh, I change his diaper, actually.

36:57.532 --> 36:58.732
Eww!

36:58.800 --> 36:59.833
Eww!

36:59.901 --> 37:02.970
Yeah, so, ladies, you think we
might be able to interest you

37:03.038 --> 37:04.502
in a couple of drinks over by the bar?

37:05.215 --> 37:07.017
Yeah, yeah, I think we'd like that.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.442
All right, I know we would.

37:08.562 --> 37:12.071
It's just so nice to meet
men that are so...caring.

37:13.216 --> 37:15.121
- Thanks for that, Shawn.
- Thank you, buddy. Thanks.

37:15.241 --> 37:16.850
Whoa. Got it.

37:16.918 --> 37:18.276
- Yeah, nice work.
- Thank you.

37:18.396 --> 37:21.555
So why don't you guys just go grab a couple
of stools over there. We'll be right over.

37:21.623 --> 37:23.590
- All right. - Nice to meet you guys.
See you in a second.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.826
- Right.
- Fantastic.

37:25.894 --> 37:27.394
Oh, my God.
How easy was that?

37:27.462 --> 37:28.962
What the hell was happening?
I don't understand.

37:29.030 --> 37:31.440
Jesus, we just made 3 chicks
in under 45 seconds.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.316
That's gotta be some kind of land pussy
speed record or something, even for me.

37:34.347 --> 37:36.003
You know what it is?
It's not us. It's him.

37:36.071 --> 37:37.738
You know what, you're right, bro.
I mean, he is, without a doubt

37:37.806 --> 37:41.575
the ultimate wingman. You know, he attracts
chicks. He doesn't mess with your game.

37:41.643 --> 37:43.277
He won't dominate the
conversation, that's for sure,

37:43.345 --> 37:44.845
and he can't cock-block you.

37:44.913 --> 37:47.214
It's unbelievable.
He's like a paralyzed pussy magnet.

37:47.282 --> 37:49.049
You know what, I'm taking him
with me on Saturday.

37:49.117 --> 37:52.820
Ok, all right, well, I want him on Friday,
and I want Saturday next weekend.

37:52.887 --> 37:54.865
No, no, we'll switch off every
other weekend, back and forth.

37:54.985 --> 37:56.141
You know what, that's perfect, bro.

37:56.163 --> 37:58.192
- Yeah.
- Guys, when do I get him?

37:58.259 --> 37:59.429
Why don't you go wash
your hands, diaper boy?

37:59.549 --> 38:02.921
That's bullshit. If you guys are gonna...

38:03.472 --> 38:06.056
That's enough! I cannot believe you!

38:06.176 --> 38:09.203
I'm just sitting over there listening to you
balloonheads actually using our

38:09.270 --> 38:11.545
paralyzed probie for you
guys picking up pussy.

38:12.841 --> 38:14.308
- You know, you're right.
- Sorry, chief.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.302
- Yeah, sorry.
- Terrible, man.

38:16.422 --> 38:17.713
Shameless action.

38:18.411 --> 38:23.454
- Ahh...But look at that pussy.
- I know.

38:23.574 --> 38:25.452
We don't want it getting cold.
Let's go. Let's hurry.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.108
Go, go, go, go, go.

38:28.365 --> 38:29.553
Who are these guys?

38:29.673 --> 38:30.810
I know.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.760
You gotta start hanging out
with a better class of people,

38:34.212 --> 38:36.097
Hey, what happened to your friend?

38:36.642 --> 38:39.171
He's a firefighter.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.099
- Are you a firefighter?
- Nah...

38:43.580 --> 38:44.963
Nah. I'm the chief.

38:45.899 --> 38:47.309
What's your name?

38:47.575 --> 38:48.854
- Abby.
- Abby?

38:48.974 --> 38:50.210
- Yeah.
- That's lovely.

38:50.278 --> 38:51.545
Thanks.

38:51.613 --> 38:52.669
Shameful.

38:54.449 --> 38:56.583
Oh, God, come on!

39:03.124 --> 39:05.117
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

39:05.237 --> 39:06.235
Yeah.

39:06.355 --> 39:07.436
You missed it.

39:08.463 --> 39:10.452
I already talked to
Colleen, all right?

39:10.572 --> 39:13.121
You missed Colleen's meeting, too?
I didn't know that.

39:13.241 --> 39:15.276
I was talking about Katy's
dance recital.

39:16.030 --> 39:18.551
Honey, something came up, OK?

39:18.671 --> 39:20.632
Yeah, something involving Damian.

39:21.456 --> 39:24.490
Pat Mahoney's pavilion dedication.
You know,

39:24.610 --> 39:27.452
things are running behind.
You know, what do you want me to do?

39:27.703 --> 39:31.900
Ok, look, Tommy, I don't want to sound cold
here, but Pat Mahoney is dead and gone.

39:32.469 --> 39:35.430
Ok, and for all intents and
purposes, so is Damian.

39:35.737 --> 39:37.903
But your daughter, on the other
hand, she is here,

39:38.476 --> 39:40.799
and she still needs her father.
And more amazingly,

39:40.919 --> 39:42.434
she still wants her father.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.517
How long do you think that's gonna last
if you keep neglecting her?

39:45.824 --> 39:47.207
How did she do?

39:47.891 --> 39:49.742
She was...

39:51.348 --> 39:53.639
Words don't do it justice.

39:54.617 --> 39:56.014
You had to be there.

39:56.328 --> 39:57.376
Yeah.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.116
Anything else you want to tell me?

40:01.353 --> 40:02.820
What, about tonight?

40:03.588 --> 40:04.874
In general.

40:04.994 --> 40:08.116
Anything, uh...On your mind?

40:08.856 --> 40:13.243
Yeah. If you want to rescue the
world, start with your children.

40:21.569 --> 40:23.292
Ahh!

40:24.372 --> 40:26.156
I'm gonna start upstairs.

40:26.276 --> 40:29.037
You stay in here and finish
the Pat Mahoney pavilion.

40:30.378 --> 40:31.733
The what?

40:32.772 --> 40:34.512
Who the hell is Pat Mahoney?

40:34.632 --> 40:37.106
Some important dead mick.
I gotta know everything?

40:37.226 --> 40:38.349
Is this new?

40:38.469 --> 40:40.838
I been working for City Hall
for 6 years, I never seen it before.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.061
Man, that's your problem, man.
You're not very observant.

40:43.318 --> 40:46.440
How else you gonna have success in life?
Maybe that's why he has a pavilion and you don't.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.986
Yeah, well, maybe I
don't want a pavilion.

40:49.372 --> 40:52.485
I gotta clean the goddamn thing.

41:20.429 --> 41:21.701
Oh...
