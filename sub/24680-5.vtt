In New York City's war on crime,

00:19.541 --> 00:22.974
He hasn't filed anything:
Louisiana, Maryland.

00:22.974 --> 00:24.677
Well, at least he's not padding

00:24.677 --> 00:27.413
All he's put in for
are a few local dinners.

00:27.413 --> 00:30.309
And those he charged
to the photo desk.

00:30.309 --> 00:34.877
- Come again?
- On Katya Jalenak's card. Not his.

00:37.641 --> 00:40.979
Thank you, Edwards.
Um, I'll talk to him.

00:40.979 --> 00:45.308
And, uh, you'll keep this
between us?

00:48.266 --> 00:54.313
Me and Carl? Mr. Elkins, there's
nothing going on between me...

00:54.313 --> 00:57.624
No one needs to know.
No one needs to lose her job.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.694
It just has to end.

01:02.999 --> 01:08.616
Don't tell me that!
They're going to crucify me.

01:08.616 --> 01:12.954
We'll talk about this after I get home.
After you send the ne...

01:12.954 --> 01:15.708
You cannot stop now!

01:23.939 --> 01:26.637
- Same thing?
- Ben!

01:26.637 --> 01:32.348
I'm almost there. I'm just waitin' 
to hear from two sources.

01:32.348 --> 01:37.062
We will crush the Times.
Trust me.

02:01.802 --> 02:04.812
all of you are truly winners.

02:08.652 --> 02:11.431
- Tough act to follow, Mr. Elkins.
- Thank you.

02:12.517 --> 02:14.863
Ben, terrific speech.

02:14.863 --> 02:17.609
- Sure, Roy, thanks.
- Everything okay?

02:17.609 --> 02:20.506
I'm, uh...
I'm up against it here, Roy.

02:24.031 --> 02:26.073
You little son of a bitch.

02:32.176 --> 02:37.165
Carl?
Carl, is that you?

02:39.857 --> 02:41.590
What was that?

02:41.590 --> 02:45.523
Come on. Let's go
make our own noise.

02:49.367 --> 02:54.557
No! Don't! No... Stop!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/10/26

03:41.353 --> 03:43.283
The deceased is Katya Jalenak.

03:43.283 --> 03:46.150
New York Sentinel employee.
Same as her boyfriend Carl Hines.

03:46.150 --> 03:49.990
It's his place. Mr. Hines was on assignment,
came home at 4:00 a.m. And found her.

03:49.990 --> 03:53.531
- What's his assignment?
- "Dark Harvest: Crime in Rural America."

03:53.531 --> 03:55.576
- He was in Pennsylvania.
- You call the paper to confirm?

03:55.576 --> 03:59.671
We left that for you.
Mr. Hines says the door was locked.

03:59.671 --> 04:01.960
- You two don't take notes?
- Uh...

04:01.960 --> 04:06.607
- Uh, we haven't worked that out yet.
- Uh-huh.

04:06.607 --> 04:09.317
Neighbor says he heard noises
around midnight.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.229
Says it wasn't the first time.

04:11.229 --> 04:14.678
You might want to note,
that's probably the murder weapon.

04:16.245 --> 04:18.389
Okay, well, she was stabbed once,

04:18.389 --> 04:23.486
uh, from behind and above.

04:32.910 --> 04:35.033
Uh, it's tea tree oil.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.510
Fire escape.
Could be a burglar.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.413
She came home,
surprised him...

04:45.751 --> 04:47.712
Tea tree oil?

04:50.590 --> 04:55.595
She fell asleep
while waiting for Carl.

04:55.595 --> 05:00.783
She heard someone.
Maybe it was him.

05:00.783 --> 05:07.073
She went out.
Something went wrong.

05:07.073 --> 05:13.164
She tried to leave,
he grabbed the scissors...from here...

05:13.164 --> 05:15.497
Blood spatter.

05:15.497 --> 05:18.933
It gets cut off. Starts again.

05:24.705 --> 05:30.884
Um...Things were removed...
from here after the killing.

05:36.104 --> 05:39.437
Detective, can you ask Mr. Hines
to come in here?

05:41.623 --> 05:44.939
Mr. Hines? The detectives
would like to speak with you.

05:48.316 --> 05:53.778
- Watch your step.
- I've been to a crime scene before. God!

05:53.778 --> 05:55.950
What the hell happened here?

05:55.950 --> 06:00.552
Well, we have two theories.

06:00.552 --> 06:06.622
Mine is, Ms. Jalenak,
she knew the assailant.

06:06.622 --> 06:09.800
She was sleeping in the bed,
and he was at the desk.

06:09.800 --> 06:15.148
Detective Bishop's theory is that,
um, she woke up to a burglary.

06:15.148 --> 06:17.933
- What do you think?
- Well, I like hers.

06:17.933 --> 06:21.887
As I already said, the poor kid was dead
when I came home.

06:21.887 --> 06:25.574
Um, can you check your desk?
See if there's anything missing?

06:25.574 --> 06:30.238
It's for my partner's burglary theory.

06:36.118 --> 06:39.198
- Something wrong?
- No.

06:39.198 --> 06:43.371
Not to knock your theory,
but it's just the way I left it.

06:44.594 --> 06:49.751
- Except this.
- What are you, testing me?

06:49.751 --> 06:54.421
- The blood. You cut yourself?
- It's Katya's.

06:54.421 --> 06:56.344
I held her when I found her.

06:56.344 --> 06:59.824
I washed the blood off my hands
after I called 911.

06:59.824 --> 07:03.139
Given she was killed here,
and given my race,

07:03.139 --> 07:06.067
I knew I would be your first suspect.

07:08.664 --> 07:10.642
THE NEW YORK SENTINEL 
PHOTO DESK
150 EAST 43RD STREET 
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16

07:10.642 --> 07:12.857
Katya joined the photo desk
last fall.

07:12.857 --> 07:15.193
She was still living at home.

07:15.193 --> 07:18.028
I needed help with my rent, 
so January, she moved in.

07:18.028 --> 07:19.838
Did you know she was seeing Carl Hines?

07:19.838 --> 07:22.158
I knew when she moved in
she was seeing someone.

07:22.158 --> 07:24.879
She had fights with her mom about it.
That's why she moved out.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.588
She was having money problems?

07:26.588 --> 07:30.053
These are past-due notices,
collection letters?

07:30.053 --> 07:34.003
- No! I mean, I never saw...
- Thank you, Camilla.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.776
Benjamin Elkins.
Sorry I'm late.

07:35.776 --> 07:37.674
We found plenty to keep us busy.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.473
Detective, the Sentinel's a family.
We'll help you any way we can,

07:40.473 --> 07:43.059
but we cannot allow you
to go through desks.

07:45.019 --> 07:45.950
Now, what do you need to know?

07:45.950 --> 07:47.974
Where was Carl Hines last night?

07:47.974 --> 07:52.081
Where I sent him: Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, on assignment.

07:52.081 --> 07:54.651
- You know that for a fact?
- Yes, because I called him.

07:54.651 --> 07:56.531
And I edited his article after he filed it.

07:56.531 --> 07:57.567
What time was that?

07:57.567 --> 08:00.823
Sometime around midnight. I came home
from a benefit, I kissed my wife good night,

08:00.823 --> 08:04.878
and then I saw that Carl had sent
his article to my Blackberry.

08:04.878 --> 08:07.390
Now, look. I understand
he's a suspect,

08:07.390 --> 08:10.878
but given that-that neighborhood that 
he lives in, and that tenement of his...

08:10.878 --> 08:14.762
I mean, isn't it more likely that
an intruder did this crime?

08:14.762 --> 08:17.299
You went to see him
at his tenement?

08:17.299 --> 08:20.720
A good mentor gets to know
his rising stars.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.395
You know, I read one of Carl's articles
in the paper today.

08:24.395 --> 08:28.309
He quotes two unnamed sources
from Lancaster. You know,

08:28.309 --> 08:31.103
maybe they can confirm
his whereabouts.

08:31.103 --> 08:34.522
First Amendment, Detective.
I can't reveal their names.

08:34.522 --> 08:38.900
Really? Not even to help one of
the members of the Sentinel family?

08:40.826 --> 08:42.364
All right, look. I'll tell you this.

08:42.364 --> 08:44.488
When I was editing his story
last night,

08:44.488 --> 08:46.743
I called the sources
to confirm their quotes.

08:46.743 --> 08:50.417
And one of them told me
that he had just spoken to him.

08:50.417 --> 08:53.915
Now if that doesn't suffice,
you can call our lawyers.

09:00.197 --> 09:02.802
Ah, don't worry about the series.

09:02.802 --> 09:05.856
Just give your notes to Rick.

09:05.856 --> 09:09.349
- Unless that's a problem?
- Well, it might be.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.585
I mean, the police sealed my
apartment, and Katya's blood...

09:12.585 --> 09:17.776
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
We're all in shock.

09:17.776 --> 09:20.690
I had just spoken to her
that afternoon, you know.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.947
- She mentioned that.
- Now, listen, Carl...

09:23.947 --> 09:29.006
I think it would be a good idea
for you to get away from all this.

09:29.006 --> 09:33.623
Just take a... paid leave,
and we'll hold your desk.

09:33.623 --> 09:36.421
You're part of
the Sentinel family, you know.

09:36.421 --> 09:39.589
And I'll never betray that trust.

09:39.589 --> 09:41.942
And we'll never turn our back on you.

09:46.439 --> 09:49.763
Not only was Katya
maxing out her credit card...

09:49.763 --> 09:52.268
she was taking five-fingered discounts.

09:52.268 --> 09:55.270
These are from her place.
They still have security tags on them.

09:55.270 --> 09:57.941
First year on her own.
She got in over her head. It happens.

09:57.941 --> 10:00.189
Not just money, she was on
the pill.

10:00.189 --> 10:02.548
Looks like she missed
as many days as she took.

10:02.548 --> 10:04.132
Oh, probably too stoned to remember.

10:04.132 --> 10:06.908
Her tox screen's positive
for coke and alcohol.

10:06.908 --> 10:09.844
The M.E. puts the time of death
at just around midnight.

10:09.844 --> 10:11.874
When Hines was still in
Pennsylvania Dutch country.

10:11.874 --> 10:15.876
- Says he was.
- So does his editor.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.811
This girl sounds like
a disaster waiting to happen.

10:18.811 --> 10:22.572
Who knows who she brought home
while Hines was out of town?

10:22.572 --> 10:26.761
Looks like Katya stopped
paying her bills three months ago.

10:26.761 --> 10:29.029
That's the same time
her free fall started.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.310
These A.T.M. withdrawals.
She was bankrupting herself.

10:32.310 --> 10:37.062
$220 at a shot, sometimes $440.
Sometimes a couple of times a day.

10:37.062 --> 10:39.296
- Late night withdrawals?
- Yeah.

10:39.296 --> 10:42.191
Cash machines at strip bars
charge a 10% premium.

10:42.191 --> 10:45.953
A $200 lap dance cost you 220.

10:45.953 --> 10:49.626
See what you missed, not working vice?

10:52.802 --> 10:56.397
Katya lent me her card to use.
She knew my credit was rocky.

10:56.397 --> 10:58.441
You were straightening it out
at a strip club?

10:58.441 --> 11:01.379
Katya liked me going to strip clubs.
It put me in a good mood.

11:01.379 --> 11:02.963
And that put her in a good mood?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.383
You can imagine what you want.

11:04.383 --> 11:08.486
What I'm trying to imagine is someone 
in a good mood shoplifting, doing drugs...

11:08.486 --> 11:10.385
We shared a bed, not feelings.

11:10.385 --> 11:13.311
Now you need to share the names of the 
sources you talked to Wednesday night.

11:13.311 --> 11:15.940
My sources live
in a very tight community.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.195
- I worked hard to gain their trust.
- This tight community.

11:19.195 --> 11:23.169
Your source is Amish.
What order, new or old...

11:23.169 --> 11:24.403
They're both old order.

11:24.403 --> 11:28.489
But that's all you're getting from me until I 
hear different from the Sentinel's lawyers.

11:31.162 --> 11:35.704
His editor, Ben Elkins, said that he talked 
to Carl's sources Wednesday night.

11:35.704 --> 11:37.726
Old order amish?
They don't use phones.

11:37.726 --> 11:41.253
Elkins lied, just to confirm
his reporter's alibi?

11:41.253 --> 11:43.474
Or to establish his own.

11:46.504 --> 11:49.299
My Katya is dead.

11:49.299 --> 11:51.640
That man should be dead too.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.235
Katya's roommate thought
you didn't approve of Mr. Hines.

11:55.235 --> 12:00.331
That's not true!
I didn't know about him.

12:01.253 --> 12:06.909
Well, if you'd known Katya
was seeing a black man,

12:06.909 --> 12:11.672
- would that have been okay?
- If he were a good man, sure.

12:11.672 --> 12:15.429
But if she were seeing a married man, 
that would have been different, wouldn't it?

12:17.994 --> 12:22.916
I tell her, it's no good for her.
Then, three months after she go,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.266
she called, crying.

12:25.266 --> 12:31.032
"You were right, Mama," she says,
"He was a rat!"

12:31.032 --> 12:34.034
She ever go away
with this married man?

12:34.034 --> 12:38.277
- Maybe on a cruise or...
- No!

12:38.277 --> 12:41.793
She come home every night.

12:41.793 --> 12:45.369
My Katya was good.

12:47.195 --> 12:49.553
Seasickness pills.

12:49.553 --> 12:52.403
She got them while
she was seeing this married man.

12:55.616 --> 12:59.755
Ben Elkins... 
He had a telescope in his office.

12:59.755 --> 13:03.627
It was aimed...at the marina.

13:03.627 --> 13:06.922
You think he was keeping
his eye on a boat?

13:06.922 --> 13:12.034
She's a beauty. With the radar, she
knows exactly where the big fish are.

13:12.034 --> 13:16.765
I'm sure that big fish weren't
the only thing he was tryin' to reel in.

13:16.765 --> 13:19.308
Yeah. He tells me, "Carlos, I don't
seduce the women!

13:19.308 --> 13:22.145
- The boat seduces them."
- That's funny.

13:22.145 --> 13:25.985
Is this one of those women?

13:25.985 --> 13:27.905
It's hard to see faces at night.

13:27.905 --> 13:31.539
Looks like he had some
new cushions done, huh?

13:31.539 --> 13:35.531
Some of these planks
have been replaced.

13:35.531 --> 13:38.207
Elkins just had some refitting done?

13:38.207 --> 13:41.045
Yeah, because of the rat. We had
a rat onboard a couple of months ago.

13:41.045 --> 13:44.342
Had to tear the boat apart
to find it.

13:44.342 --> 13:47.264
But you've got rat catchers
on the line.

13:47.264 --> 13:50.984
- I think somebody laid a rat on the boat.
- Carlos!

13:50.984 --> 13:53.071
It's a terrible thing to do.
Excuse me.

13:53.071 --> 13:55.594
- Wanna show you something.
- A rat for a rat.

13:55.594 --> 14:00.369
Well, Katya was after the boat,
she was after his star reporter...

14:00.369 --> 14:03.768
Elkins had to know sooner or later,
she was gonna bring him down.

14:03.768 --> 14:06.953
Not if he brought her down first.

14:06.953 --> 14:09.061
HOME OF ROY HINES
FOREST HILLS, NEW YORK
FRIDAY, SEPTEMVER 19

14:09.061 --> 14:13.779
Ben Elkins? Yes, we did speak
at the banquet. But why...

14:13.779 --> 14:17.573
- Oh, you thought we were here
about your son. - Yes.

14:17.573 --> 14:20.616
He told me you were all over him,
despite his alibi.

14:20.616 --> 14:23.250
Well, now we're checking on
Mr. Elkins's alibi.

14:23.250 --> 14:28.546
Anyway, this banquet, doesn't it end with 
the presentation of the Dennis Murphy Award?

14:28.546 --> 14:32.048
- Yes.
- But Mr. Elkins skipped out early.

14:32.048 --> 14:35.177
He may have, but he's always
there when we need him.

14:35.177 --> 14:38.258
Every year, Ben takes one
of our students as his intern.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.469
And that's how Carl got...
got his start.

14:40.469 --> 14:44.645
Sorry. Should I go to my room
while you finish harassing my father?

14:44.645 --> 14:47.686
Carl? They're asking about Ben.

14:49.187 --> 14:53.747
- What about him? / - We believe he had an 
affair with Katya and that it ended badly.

14:53.747 --> 14:55.825
Well, your belief is a lie.

14:55.825 --> 14:58.304
Ben Elkins is a happily married man.

14:58.304 --> 15:02.852
I hope that Ben can repay
all this loyalty someday.

15:02.852 --> 15:05.934
Ben and my father taught me
to honor the truth.

15:05.934 --> 15:09.152
That's what I'm doing.

15:09.152 --> 15:15.766
Your street, in Flatbush, was recently
dug up because of a water main.

15:15.766 --> 15:19.342
Now, l-I bet that kicked up
a few rats.

15:19.342 --> 15:23.537
Yes. The super put traps everywhere.

15:23.537 --> 15:25.018
What, is that your new theory?

15:25.018 --> 15:28.156
- That Katya was stabbed to death
by a gang of rats? / - Carl.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.997
QUATRE SAISONS
55 EAST 57TH STREET
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23

15:33.997 --> 15:37.279
Right now? This is a joke.
Call my office, make an appointment.

15:37.279 --> 15:40.782
We talked to your secretary, and she said
we couldn't get ahold of you for a week.

15:40.782 --> 15:45.956
- Look, you don't even have to get up.
You just sit there, and we.../ - Detective!

15:45.956 --> 15:49.668
Um, uh, a reporter from the Ledger told us 
about a rumor...

15:49.668 --> 15:53.710
about Katya Jalenak and a married man.

15:53.710 --> 15:56.174
I wouldn't wipe my ass with the Ledger.

15:56.174 --> 16:01.697
And if you're fishing, I'm not conversant
with my employees'private lives.

16:02.939 --> 16:06.603
All right. Well. Excu...
Sorry. Excuse me, gentlemen.

16:07.522 --> 16:12.156
You know, speaking of fishing, there 
was another rumor about Ms. Jalenak...

16:12.156 --> 16:16.657
- and a rat on a boat...
- You're pushing it, Detective.

16:16.657 --> 16:19.570
You know, come to think of it,
Mr. Elkins has a boat.

16:19.570 --> 16:23.577
He's got a 47-foot Sportsman
with brand-new upholstery...

16:23.577 --> 16:26.537
What are you insinuating?

16:26.537 --> 16:29.981
I wonder how Katya felt.

16:29.981 --> 16:33.505
You know, about the... the rat

16:33.505 --> 16:38.380
gnawin' on all that expensive teak...
and Italian leather.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.854
Think that made up for the...
the kick that you gave her in the gut?

16:41.854 --> 16:42.895
How dare y...

16:43.899 --> 16:47.955
How dare you imply
that I would cheat on my wife.

16:47.955 --> 16:50.184
I would never. You can ask
anybody in this room.

16:50.184 --> 16:52.020
We tried to get
in touch with Carl's source...

16:52.020 --> 16:54.912
you know, the one
you talked to Wednesday night?

16:54.912 --> 16:58.777
We couldn't get through.
You know why?

16:58.777 --> 17:02.071
- They don't have phones.
- You calling me a liar?

17:02.071 --> 17:03.880
Well, you go ahead. You dig all you want.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.585
You follow me until you die of jealousy.

17:06.585 --> 17:10.996
- "Dig all we want"? / - Whatever it takes 
to satisfy your curiosity.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.377
You won't find anything.

17:15.814 --> 17:20.009
Thanks. All right. Gentlemen?

17:21.365 --> 17:23.602
Well, that sounds like consent
to a search.

17:23.602 --> 17:25.388
I think we'll start
with his expense account.

17:25.388 --> 17:28.695
So you know, I did not enjoy that.

17:28.695 --> 17:31.919
No? Eames would have.

17:31.919 --> 17:38.037
"April. Dinner with Tony Shen from Sports.
Carl Hines and Jack Abrams, Metro."

17:38.037 --> 17:42.377
Maybe we should find out if those reporters 
weren't busy somewhere else on those dates.

17:42.377 --> 17:44.909
Can you check their expenses?

17:47.497 --> 17:52.012
Tony Shen. No expenses for the 15th.

17:52.012 --> 17:55.587
Jack Abrams.
No expenses for the 29th.

17:55.587 --> 17:59.878
- Carl Hines.
- No expenses.

17:59.878 --> 18:04.025
- You didn't even look him up.
- Mr. Hines never submits expenses.

18:04.025 --> 18:06.888
- Never?
- Just a few meals in Brooklyn.

18:06.888 --> 18:13.060
On Ms. Jalenak's card. We can't get him
to file his reports. It's a problem.

18:14.562 --> 18:16.499
Look, you have some terrific ideas, Adam.

18:16.499 --> 18:20.239
Um, can I call you back?
Thanks.

18:22.298 --> 18:26.490
-Who was that?
- My new agent in Los Angeles.

18:26.490 --> 18:29.724
Ben introduced me.

18:29.724 --> 18:32.506
You're not going back
to the Sentinel?

18:32.506 --> 18:38.003
- I'm taking a sabbatical.
- Stop that.

18:38.003 --> 18:41.641
This tragedy was
a wake-up call, Carl.

18:41.641 --> 18:45.256
What happened to that girl could have
just as easily have happened to you.

18:45.256 --> 18:47.717
Stop messing up.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.854
In the last four months,

18:52.854 --> 18:57.004
Carl has written articles
on Louisiana oystermen,

18:57.004 --> 18:58.487
priests in Maine...

18:58.487 --> 19:04.174
He hasn't put in for one flight,
one hotel room... not even gas money.

19:04.174 --> 19:07.538
So he's no good with his paperwork.
What's that have to do with Ben Elkins?

19:07.538 --> 19:11.174
Well, maybe nothing.
But it's not just about expenses.

19:11.174 --> 19:16.520
Here. This is a profile that
he wrote on homeless kids.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.515
"They often beg with pets,

19:18.515 --> 19:22.381
because people are more likely to offer food
to a stray cat than a homeless teenager."

19:22.381 --> 19:27.989
Taken, word for word, from an article 
a month earlier from the Cincinnati Bee.

19:27.989 --> 19:30.978
- So the guy's a thief.
- No.

19:30.978 --> 19:37.537
In this piece on Amish drug dealers,
he wrote that he saw... quote,

19:37.537 --> 19:43.940
"a beautiful, colored quilt hiding the false 
bottom of a horse-drawn buggy."

19:43.940 --> 19:47.825
Now, a reporter from
the Pittsburgh Examiner...

19:47.825 --> 19:52.035
wrote about that same quilt
a week before.

19:52.035 --> 19:54.205
This torpedoes his alibi.

19:54.205 --> 19:56.788
On the night of the murder,
when he claims to be in Pennsylvania,

19:56.788 --> 20:00.837
- he could have been anywhere
- Maybe Katya realized what he was up to.

20:00.837 --> 20:05.942
Maybe it was one more deception
than she could live with.

20:05.942 --> 20:11.760
So, Carl Hines, thief.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.788
And now a murderer.

20:16.694 --> 20:19.712
His articles are filled with visual details.
How did he get those,

20:19.712 --> 20:21.748
unless he went to the places
he wrote about?

20:21.748 --> 20:24.822
He got them from photos
from the Sentinel's photographers.

20:24.822 --> 20:27.695
The photographers take hundreds of 
pictures for each story.

20:27.695 --> 20:31.590
Katya was e-mailing Carl huge files
filled with photos.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.959
- Every picture the photographers took.
- Here, an article on the oystermen.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.911
"The dock was strewn with the laceless

20:36.911 --> 20:39.708
and mud-stained shoes 
of the Louisiana oystermen."

20:39.708 --> 20:43.547
We found dozens of examples.
He couldn't have done it without her.

20:43.547 --> 20:46.984
If she was helping him, why kill her?

20:46.984 --> 20:49.176
When's the last e-mail she sent him?

20:49.176 --> 20:53.270
Wednesday, the night she was killed.
Could be for the Amish article.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.727
Oh, uh... the end of the road.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.445
She was telling him
that it was over.

21:04.445 --> 21:08.821
But why now?
What made her stop?

21:08.821 --> 21:11.243
Maybe her conscience
got the better of her.

21:11.243 --> 21:15.504
You know, Ben confirmed
Carl's phony alibi.

21:15.504 --> 21:17.264
When I asked Carl

21:17.264 --> 21:19.998
if there was anything missing  
from his desk, he hesitated. He lied.

21:19.998 --> 21:22.590
We thought because
he was guilty of the murder.

21:22.590 --> 21:27.596
Or he lied because what was missing
from his desk was evidence of his fraud.

21:27.596 --> 21:34.474
You know, papers, computer disks,
uh, photo printouts?

21:34.474 --> 21:38.435
He hesitated.

21:38.435 --> 21:41.907
Because he was confused,
because he didn't take them.

21:41.907 --> 21:45.151
- The killer did.
- The killer, Ben Elkins.

21:45.151 --> 21:48.444
He learned of the fraud
and didn't want it made public.

21:48.444 --> 21:52.295
We'd have to prove he knew
what Carl was up to.

21:52.295 --> 21:54.788
Really. So I made everything up?

21:54.788 --> 21:58.429
Well, no. Only the things
you didn't plagiarize.

21:58.429 --> 22:02.295
The Cincinnati Bee,
the Pittsburgh Examiner...

22:02.295 --> 22:04.756
My son writes for the Sentinel.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.630
He doesn't need to steal
from second-rate papers.

22:07.630 --> 22:12.134
Well, you can just see
for yourself, Mr. Hines.

22:14.603 --> 22:19.738
Fine. Uh, well, he didn't bother
to, uh, change the punctuation.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.852
Look, I don't steal. Okay?

22:22.852 --> 22:25.918
I write all my own reports.

22:25.918 --> 22:31.149
- Katya never helped me with any...
- No, Katya, she helped you.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.485
She wanted to get back at Ben.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.570
And the more she helped you,
the worse she felt.

22:36.570 --> 22:39.790
- She got in too deep.
- It wasn't like that.

22:39.790 --> 22:43.585
That's why she sent you this.

22:43.585 --> 22:46.839
Because Ben found out, didn't he?

22:46.839 --> 22:52.551
You know, he could lose his... position.
He could lose his career...

22:52.551 --> 22:55.090
because of what you did.

22:55.090 --> 22:58.681
- That's why he killed her.
- No, I didn't have anything to do with that.

22:58.681 --> 23:02.643
No, w-we know!

23:03.976 --> 23:10.074
Just tell us what Ben knew.
Just tell us what Katya told you.

23:10.074 --> 23:11.909
Okay.

23:28.002 --> 23:30.130
I need some air.

23:34.603 --> 23:39.575
- You're wrong about this.
- You're saying, Ben didn't kill Katya?

23:39.575 --> 23:44.306
You mean that we're wrong
about something else?

23:44.306 --> 23:48.321
When Carl took up with Katya,
he crossed a line.

23:48.321 --> 23:53.457
- Ben's line.
- Because Carl was his former intern?

23:53.457 --> 23:57.403
Black intern, is that
what you're saying?

23:57.403 --> 24:01.241
Ben would have been uncomfortable
with the thought of...

24:01.241 --> 24:04.501
my Carl cavorting with
his fair-haired conquest.

24:04.501 --> 24:11.125
For Ben, loyalty means...
knowing your place, staying there.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.761
It sounds like you know him well.

24:14.761 --> 24:19.311
Thirty years. Ever since that book
of his about his housekeeper.

24:19.311 --> 24:23.529
I gave it a good review.
For Ebony.

24:23.529 --> 24:26.311
- Back then you were a journalist.
- A freelance.

24:26.311 --> 24:29.984
But for me, teaching was my calling.
Like my father before me.

24:29.984 --> 24:32.421
Back then...

24:32.421 --> 24:38.194
the doors to the Sentinel,
or any paper, they weren't open for you.

24:38.194 --> 24:41.969
Yeah, that's another fact.

24:41.969 --> 24:46.539
Not like they have been for Carl.

24:46.539 --> 24:50.023
I tell him he doesn't understand
how lucky he is.

24:50.023 --> 24:53.421
His generation has had
everything handed to them.

24:53.421 --> 24:56.028
Like ballplayers?

24:56.028 --> 25:00.968
You know, like compare Barry Bonds's life
with what Willie Mays went through?

25:00.968 --> 25:07.579
- Is that what you're saying?
- They don't know how things used to be.

25:07.579 --> 25:12.071
I saw Willie Mays once, in the street.

25:12.071 --> 25:14.955
I was with my dad.
He brought me over to him.

25:14.955 --> 25:21.002
Maybe it was a bad day,
but, uh, Willie...

25:21.002 --> 25:23.740
He was one angry guy.

25:33.881 --> 25:36.474
I need to get to work now.

25:36.474 --> 25:41.803
If you were showing me how to turn a friendly 
witness into a hostile one, you succeeded.

25:41.803 --> 25:44.430
Did you believe his rap
on Ben Elkins as a hypocrite?

25:44.430 --> 25:48.649
Whether Ben Elkins is a closet bigot,
or just afraid for his career,

25:48.649 --> 25:50.567
he's good for the murder.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.561
You-You're gonna take
a run at him?

25:52.561 --> 25:55.857
As long as it's not in a restaurant.

25:55.857 --> 25:58.492
You bring in Elkins;
I'll bring in his book.

25:58.492 --> 26:00.636
A lot of reporters mix up their notes.

26:00.636 --> 26:02.699
If you knew anything about 
the newspaper business...

26:02.699 --> 26:06.475
We know enough to see...this is a major 
scandal that could sink your career.

26:06.475 --> 26:10.910
- Huh? / - Over 40 articles by Carl were 
found to have plagiarized passages,

26:10.910 --> 26:13.881
nonexistent sources,
errors of fact.

26:13.881 --> 26:17.679
I know what's going on here.
This is not about plagiarism.

26:17.679 --> 26:20.216
- Any more than it's about Katya.
- Ben...

26:20.216 --> 26:24.178
Katya's murder is being used
not just to smear Carl and me,

26:24.178 --> 26:29.034
but to attack the Sentinel's commitment
to diversity in its hiring policy.

26:29.034 --> 26:31.187
Mr. Elkins, do not play that card with me.

26:31.187 --> 26:34.726
Only a racist would turn this into a 
referendum... on affirmative action

26:34.726 --> 26:37.833
You have no idea... the battles I've 
fought to diversify that newsroom.

26:37.833 --> 26:44.027
He's right. I think
we're being unfair to Mr. Elkins.

26:44.027 --> 26:49.597
- Thank you.
- I-I read your book.

26:49.597 --> 26:55.791
In it, he writes that his parents were
so distant from him that he spent...

26:55.791 --> 27:00.628
most of his childhood
with his housekeeper, Dora.

27:00.628 --> 27:04.682
She practically raised me.
I was never able to thank her.

27:04.682 --> 27:06.802
Then she passed away.

27:06.802 --> 27:11.729
And you realized that you never knew 
anything about her.

27:11.729 --> 27:16.458
And...it's moving,

27:16.458 --> 27:20.610
how it inspired you to then open doors...to,

27:20.610 --> 27:23.212
uh, well, African Americans like Carl...

27:23.212 --> 27:26.914
- and have an interest in their lives.
- That's right. It did.

27:26.914 --> 27:31.350
You even visited Carl in his apartment
in Flatbush... isn't that what you told us?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.437
Yes, a few months ago.

27:33.437 --> 27:35.213
Even though it was
a lousy neighborhood,

27:35.213 --> 27:39.586
even though he had to ride
a urine-soaked elevator to Carl's floor...

27:39.586 --> 27:42.171
Well, that doesn't bother me.

27:42.171 --> 27:45.755
You ever thought about your Katya
in that elevator, you know...

27:45.755 --> 27:50.970
- Going up to meet Carl?
- No! And she wasn't "my" Katya.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.306
She was bedding down with your protege.

27:53.306 --> 27:54.440
Think she was doing that to spite you?

27:54.440 --> 27:57.808
I don't know, and I don't care.

27:57.808 --> 27:59.777
Y-You don't care?

27:59.777 --> 28:03.495
That she was, you know, "giving it up"
to the hired help?

28:03.495 --> 28:07.569
Listen, I left that kind of thinking
in the past, where it belongs.

28:07.569 --> 28:11.866
Yeah, you mean, at Dora's funeral.

28:11.866 --> 28:14.578
That's where you met her son
for the first time.

28:14.578 --> 28:19.459
- Yeah.
- You're really a hypocrite.

28:19.459 --> 28:24.553
You know? I mean, all this stuff about
opening doors and visiting Carl...

28:24.553 --> 28:28.303
Come on. I mean,
it's such... a crock.

28:28.303 --> 28:30.896
- That's not true / - Come on, you 
never visited your housekeeper.

28:30.896 --> 28:32.804
You never visited Carl.
Because if you had, you'd know...

28:32.804 --> 28:36.579
that he lives in a four-floor walk-up...
there's no "urine-soaked" elevator.

28:36.579 --> 28:38.770
There's no elevator at all!

28:38.770 --> 28:43.024
Come on, the truth is, you never
stepped a foot in his place.

28:43.024 --> 28:47.628
And that's why
you couldn't have killed Katya.

28:47.628 --> 28:49.547
- Well, exactly.
- Exactly.

28:49.547 --> 28:52.449
Detective? A word.

28:56.389 --> 28:59.397
Are you working for
the defense now?

28:59.397 --> 29:01.642
He's a racist,
but he's not a killer.

29:01.642 --> 29:04.976
So then we're back to Carl again.
He killed Katya to save his job.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.887
No, the job meant
a lot to Carl.

29:07.887 --> 29:12.319
But it means the world
to someone else.

29:16.432 --> 29:20.019
I don't know what to tell the students
about Carl's cheating.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.355
How do you think
his father will react?

29:22.355 --> 29:25.359
Put it this way: Last year, when
he found out our valedictorian...

29:25.359 --> 29:27.525
bought a term paper
off the Internet...

29:27.525 --> 29:31.994
he called up Harvard
and torpedoed her admission.

29:31.994 --> 29:34.698
There are the archives.

29:36.349 --> 29:38.665
The faculty advisor, that's Roy?

29:38.665 --> 29:40.958
Isn't your warrant
for Carl's old articles?

29:40.958 --> 29:44.924
- It's actually for the whole office.
- But this is a newspaper.

29:44.924 --> 29:49.635
School newspaper. Not generally covered 
by the First Amendment.

29:49.635 --> 29:53.106
Gun cleaner. What part
of the curriculum is that for?

29:53.106 --> 29:57.056
We had a teacher get shot
in the bathroom in 1988.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.915
Roy got a permit
to carry a pistol.

29:59.915 --> 30:02.751
Roy doesn't do anything halfway.

30:02.751 --> 30:05.232
Well, we're not the only ones
interested in Carl's archives.

30:05.232 --> 30:09.741
These are his clips from,
uh, his junior year.

30:13.992 --> 30:18.210
- He has back problems?
- Uh, he has sciatica.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.343
Why, these are quite good.

30:20.343 --> 30:23.916
That's why I don't understand
why he'd resort to cheating.

30:23.916 --> 30:28.312
Compulsive.
You know, like, uh, kleptomania.

30:33.176 --> 30:39.263
This is very clever. He wrote a profile of 
the school janitor on graduation day.

30:39.263 --> 30:41.498
That got him his internship.

30:41.498 --> 30:45.084
"I been here 20 years.
The students, they come and they go.

30:45.084 --> 30:48.062
After a while,
it's like watching the tides."

30:48.062 --> 30:50.206
Roy always said Carl got good quotes.

30:50.206 --> 30:54.758
Yeah, but that one.
It's the kind of quote that stays with you.

30:55.845 --> 31:01.203
Here. Last month, Carl quoted
a Louisiana Fish and Game official.

31:01.203 --> 31:04.415
"Been here 20 years, watching
the oystermen as they come and go.

31:04.415 --> 31:08.625
After a while, it's like
watching the tides."

31:08.625 --> 31:10.986
He even steals from himself.

31:10.986 --> 31:13.181
You know, Roy is like a stage mother.

31:13.181 --> 31:15.298
He reads everything that Carl writes.

31:15.298 --> 31:18.536
- He would have made the connection.
- And hit the roof.

31:18.536 --> 31:22.269
Yeah. Maybe he started to dig.
The more he dug, the angrier he got.

31:22.269 --> 31:26.022
You know, when he ran
into Elkins at the awards...

31:26.022 --> 31:30.336
I don't know... he must have
sensed that time was running out.

31:30.336 --> 31:33.487
He had to confront Carl.

31:33.487 --> 31:35.528
- How's his alibi?
- Paper thin.

31:35.528 --> 31:38.197
We think he had a key,
let himself into Carl's,

31:38.197 --> 31:40.991
ran into the girl, found that
she was part of the fraud,

31:40.991 --> 31:42.546
he panicked and killed her.

31:42.546 --> 31:47.624
Then he picked up every piece
of evidence of Carl's fraud.

31:47.624 --> 31:49.375
You know...

31:52.212 --> 31:57.677
These boxes. You see how
they're stacked, corner on corner?

31:57.677 --> 32:01.275
Right in the middle of Carl's chaos.

32:04.366 --> 32:05.666
I'm gonna open a window, okay?

32:05.666 --> 32:09.148
Uh, no. Please. And just stay by the door.
Thank you.

32:12.108 --> 32:13.984
Looks like Roy's writing.

32:33.234 --> 32:37.798
Uh, was the closet empty
when you, uh...

32:37.798 --> 32:40.361
- put the traps in?
- No, it was stacked with boxes.

32:40.361 --> 32:43.303
Those boxes. I could
hardly squeeze the traps in.

32:43.303 --> 32:45.456
Right, so you moved the boxes when
you put the traps in.

32:45.456 --> 32:47.226
No, they were pretty heavy.

33:12.876 --> 33:14.845
Anybody been in here
since the murder?

33:14.845 --> 33:16.964
- Carl. He tried to get in here.
- When?

33:16.964 --> 33:19.631
Yesterday. He wanted me to
let him in to get some clothes.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.120
He said the cops took his keys,
and his father doesn't have one.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.071
But I told him,
I can't break the seal.

33:28.366 --> 33:30.315
If he was trying to
tamper with evidence,

33:30.315 --> 33:32.623
why get the super involved?
That doesn't seem very smart.

33:32.623 --> 33:36.698
Except now the super can testify that
Carl told him Roy didn't have a key.

33:36.698 --> 33:39.659
Maybe that's the point. 
To help Roy's defense.

33:39.659 --> 33:42.158
That implies Carl knows
his father killed the girl.

33:42.158 --> 33:46.577
Roy killed her to protect Carl's secret, 
and now Carl is returning the favor.

33:46.577 --> 33:49.848
We need to convince Carl
to tell us what he knows.

33:49.848 --> 33:51.959
- After what his dad's done for him?
- Yes. No, that's what

33:51.959 --> 33:55.890
I expected to find out. Just fax me the 
report. Okay. Thank you.

33:55.890 --> 33:59.234
So Carl had no idea
what his father was up to.

33:59.234 --> 34:00.839
We need to show him.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.431
We need a search warrant
for those boxes.

34:03.431 --> 34:05.845
You don't need one.
They're at the crime scene.

34:05.845 --> 34:09.415
Uh, I want a search warrant.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.460
And I want Roy to know
that we're getting one.

34:14.362 --> 34:18.876
Those boxes contain family papers that, 
uh, have nothing to do with the case.

34:18.876 --> 34:21.737
Mr. Hines can vouch that
he sealed them several years ago.

34:21.737 --> 34:27.141
Once we ascertain the date of the contents,
you can take them away.

34:27.141 --> 34:30.348
Uh, these boxes.
You always keep them here?

34:30.348 --> 34:33.371
No. They're usually in the closet.

34:33.371 --> 34:37.416
- Did you move them?
- Mm, no. I thought the police did.

34:37.416 --> 34:39.780
No. You see, the blood spatter,

34:39.780 --> 34:42.360
that means they were already here
when Katya was killed.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.822
Maybe the killer moved them.

34:45.822 --> 34:49.649
Well, that's an idea.

34:49.649 --> 34:52.871
But then, why empty the closet?
Do you keep valuables in there?

34:52.871 --> 34:55.228
No, just junk.

34:55.228 --> 34:57.256
Yeah, junk and rat traps.

34:57.256 --> 35:00.085
Well, maybe they were after
what was in the boxes.

35:00.085 --> 35:02.540
You know, your high school papers.

35:02.540 --> 35:06.011
- The articles that you wrote for the 
Clarion. / - I doubt that.

35:06.011 --> 35:08.124
Oh, don't be so modest.
We read them.

35:08.124 --> 35:09.660
We thought
they were really good, right?

35:09.660 --> 35:15.082
Especially the one about
the high school janitor?

35:15.082 --> 35:18.342
- What was it he said?
- Oh, "The students, they come and go.

35:18.342 --> 35:21.820
After a while, it's like
watching the tides."

35:21.820 --> 35:23.844
It reminds me of something
that I read...

35:23.844 --> 35:26.843
about Louisiana oystermen.

35:26.843 --> 35:28.970
Yeah, well, don't be so coy.
Your father knows all about it.

35:28.970 --> 35:32.222
That's how we found the article.
It was on his desk.

35:32.222 --> 35:36.795
Oh, Carl and I... have talked.

35:36.795 --> 35:39.145
And he's admitted his mistakes.

35:39.145 --> 35:43.246
Your son, whom you taught
to honor the truth...

35:43.246 --> 35:48.382
admitted that he was a-a plagiarist?

35:48.382 --> 35:51.371
Well, you don't sound all that upset.

35:51.371 --> 35:54.923
I am, of course, very disappointed.

35:54.923 --> 35:59.085
You know, you got all these staples
popped out. You gotta fix this.

35:59.085 --> 36:02.974
Look! I mean, this cable could
end up like this.

36:02.974 --> 36:07.677
I mean, somebody could trip,
and they could hurt themselves.

36:10.428 --> 36:12.139
- Disappointed, you said?
- Yes.

36:12.139 --> 36:15.477
That-That Carl would
ruin his future?

36:15.477 --> 36:17.784
And disgrace the Sentinel?

36:17.784 --> 36:20.187
And that you would be humiliated
in front of your peers.

36:20.187 --> 36:25.363
In front of your own students.
Disappointed, huh?

36:25.363 --> 36:29.905
I don't think that that begins
to describe how you felt, Mr. Hines.

36:29.905 --> 36:34.503
Come on. You were terrified.

36:34.503 --> 36:38.082
Oh, that's not true at all.

36:38.082 --> 36:39.896
Carl knows that it is.

36:42.207 --> 36:45.587
That night, your father...

36:45.587 --> 36:48.758
He came over to warn you?
Is that what he told you?

36:48.758 --> 36:50.427
My father didn't say anything.

36:50.427 --> 36:53.235
Yeah, he said that he acted
to protect you.

36:53.235 --> 36:55.489
And that's why he killed Katya.
That's why he cleaned off your desk.

36:55.489 --> 36:58.893
My father said no such thing.

36:58.893 --> 37:01.586
Hey! Uh, you didn't change
this lightbulb recently, did you?

37:01.586 --> 37:03.112
What? Uh, no.

37:03.112 --> 37:10.697
Well, there's a mark in the dust,
inside the shade.

37:10.697 --> 37:13.699
Somebody fiddled with the lightbulb.

37:13.699 --> 37:17.896
Carl, if you came home that night,
that bulb was unscrewed,

37:17.896 --> 37:21.790
- you wouldn't have seen the cable.
You'd trip./ - So what?

37:21.790 --> 37:24.640
Well, once you're on the floor,if there 
was somebody hiding in the closet...

37:24.640 --> 37:27.891
now that there's room...

37:27.891 --> 37:31.612
Well, they could get
the jump on you.

37:31.612 --> 37:36.573
- And who would do that?
- Your father.

37:37.767 --> 37:42.284
- That's how he planned to kill you.
- Oh, come on. Kill me for what?

37:42.284 --> 37:49.236
The plagiarism.
That was all about him. Wasn't it?

37:49.236 --> 37:53.909
- To get back at him?
- What's the big deal about plagiarism?

37:53.909 --> 37:57.913
For God's sakes! You're a plagiarist,
they make you a U.S. Senator.

37:57.913 --> 38:00.976
They give you your own TV show.
I got a book deal.

38:00.976 --> 38:05.339
No one cares about plagiarism.

38:05.339 --> 38:10.841
- You don't agree, Mr. Hines?
- My son is very foolish.

38:10.841 --> 38:16.056
But I would never do
anything to harm him.

38:16.056 --> 38:19.849
You have a .38?

38:19.849 --> 38:21.645
I have a permit.

38:21.645 --> 38:25.797
I haven't fired it
in almost 14 years.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.231
But you'd clean it
before you used it.

38:28.231 --> 38:32.736
Our lab examined the bulb
from the hallway.

38:32.736 --> 38:37.043
They found a residue of
gun-cleaning fluid...

38:37.043 --> 38:39.786
left there by someone who handled
a recently cleaned gun.

38:39.786 --> 38:47.525
Left there by... you.

38:47.525 --> 38:51.561
When you unscrewed the bulb,
you came armed.

38:51.561 --> 38:58.031
And you made all the preparations
for when Carl got home...

38:58.031 --> 39:05.743
And that's how Katya woke up.

39:05.743 --> 39:09.615
You had no idea
that she was here.

39:09.615 --> 39:14.459
Come on. He didn't come here to
protect you. He came here to kill you.

39:18.711 --> 39:25.838
Carl, don't believe a word of it.

39:25.838 --> 39:28.753
This doesn't make any sense.
If he was here with a gun,

39:28.753 --> 39:32.046
- why didn't he use it on Miss Jalenak?
- Because of the noise.

39:32.046 --> 39:35.103
But he wouldn't worry about the noise
when he was going to shoot his own son?

39:35.103 --> 39:41.604
It doesn't matter how much noise
he would make when he shot Carl.

39:41.604 --> 39:46.145
Because Roy wasn't planning on
leaving this apartment alive. Were you, Roy?

39:50.328 --> 39:52.496
Tell me about your sciatica.

39:52.496 --> 39:54.738
How's it doin'?

39:54.738 --> 39:57.884
- I don't see what that has to do...
- When people commit suicide,

39:57.884 --> 40:03.746
with, uh, pills...

40:03.746 --> 40:08.559
Or a gun...
It's all about comfort.

40:08.559 --> 40:09.732
They make themselves comfortable.

40:09.732 --> 40:12.777
They lay down in a bed. 
They sit in an easy chair.

40:17.425 --> 40:20.188
They want to make sure that
they have all the...

40:20.188 --> 40:25.563
the back support that they need.

40:25.563 --> 40:30.355
Especially when their sciatica
is bothering them.

40:30.355 --> 40:36.238
And once they're comfortable?
And relaxed?

40:36.238 --> 40:40.196
They pull the trigger.

40:40.196 --> 40:42.533
I'm not that kind of person.

40:42.533 --> 40:45.868
There'd be nothing left
of your kind of person...

40:45.868 --> 40:49.396
if everyone found out what Carl did.

40:49.396 --> 40:53.444
Come on, he spat on everything
that you stood for.

40:53.444 --> 40:59.681
Everything that you dreamed of
for yourself, for him.

40:59.681 --> 41:04.433
This ungrateful little bastard
doesn't know how lucky he is.

41:04.433 --> 41:10.481
- Shut up./ - Come on, he's had 
everything served right up to him.

41:10.481 --> 41:17.831
You wanted him... down.
On the ground.

41:17.831 --> 41:22.581
Just for once.
With him lookin'up at you.

41:27.387 --> 41:33.419
It's true.
You were going to kill me.

41:36.270 --> 41:40.568
You're pathetic.

41:40.568 --> 41:43.139
Don't you get it?

41:43.139 --> 41:48.601
I fooled the best editors at some
of the best papers in the world!

41:48.601 --> 41:52.770
God! I even fooled you for ten years!

41:54.734 --> 41:57.710
You stupid boy.

41:57.710 --> 42:03.419
You stupid, hateful boy.

42:10.787 --> 42:14.055
He told me he was here.

42:14.055 --> 42:18.713
And what he did... to Katya.

42:18.713 --> 42:23.182
He said he was comin' to save me.

42:23.182 --> 42:30.455
Save me! 
You were comin' to kill me, Dad.

42:34.744 --> 42:40.941
Roy Hines, you're under arrest...
for murder.

42:40.941 --> 42:45.368
How could you, Dad?
Dad! How could you?

42:45.368 --> 42:50.621
- Hey, hey. 
- How could you?

42:50.621 --> 42:51.918
Come on.

42:57.723 --> 42:59.842
It was my own father.

43:07.145 --> 43:10.681

- What's that?

43:10.681 --> 43:13.562
No stomach for the truth.
