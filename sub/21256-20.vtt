00:04.040 --> 00:05.620
Previously on The Fosters...

00:05.621 --> 00:08.240
Brandon Foster, Musician's Institute!

00:08.326 --> 00:09.390
I can't believe she's gone.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.459
Callie Adams Foster,

00:11.495 --> 00:14.129
UCSD five-year law program.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.231
As much as I care about you,

00:16.265 --> 00:18.667
I think I need to see
where things go with Amanda.

00:18.702 --> 00:21.903
Jesus Adams Foster, San
Diego Community College.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.338
I'm gonna go to college.

00:23.373 --> 00:24.718
Then I'll go wherever you're going.

00:24.742 --> 00:26.107
Emma got an abortion.

00:26.142 --> 00:28.353
You didn't give Jesus a chance
to tell you what he really wanted.

00:28.377 --> 00:32.046
Mariana Adams Foster, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:32.081 --> 00:33.547
We'll both be in Boston,

00:33.582 --> 00:35.916
- so maybe we can grab a cup of coffee or something.
- You're on.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.585
Jude Adams Foster, UCLA.

00:39.656 --> 00:40.933
I think it's time for a career change.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.023
It's not like we're done.

00:42.058 --> 00:43.868
I swear they need you more
in their 20s than ever.

00:43.892 --> 00:46.259
He has a... a kid who needs a home.

00:46.294 --> 00:47.326
What should I tell him?

00:47.362 --> 00:49.029
Grace, y... you loved her.

00:49.064 --> 00:50.064
What makes you so sure?

00:50.098 --> 00:52.265
Because I've been loved by you, Brandon,

00:52.300 --> 00:54.701
and it is a powerful thing.

00:54.736 --> 00:56.870
Eliza and I are engaged.

00:56.905 --> 00:57.937
That's amazing.

01:03.678 --> 01:06.045
Everyone, everyone, just... Thank you.

01:07.181 --> 01:10.215
Umm, Lena and I would
like to thank all of you

01:10.250 --> 01:12.084
for coming tonight to help us celebrate

01:12.119 --> 01:16.488
our recent college grads,
Brandon and Mariana, Callie.

01:16.523 --> 01:17.523
And Emma.

01:17.557 --> 01:19.456
And Emma, our beautiful Emma.

01:21.895 --> 01:23.795
And also to congratulate Jude

01:23.830 --> 01:26.064
on finishing up his first year at UCLA.

01:26.099 --> 01:27.264
Way to go, bud.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.300
Whoo!

01:28.334 --> 01:30.001
Thank you.

01:30.036 --> 01:31.169
Uh, which reminds me,

01:31.204 --> 01:32.815
we still haven't seen
your final grades yet.

01:32.839 --> 01:34.404
Uh, neither have I.

01:34.439 --> 01:36.839
- The moment you get them...
- You will be the first to know.

01:38.343 --> 01:40.476
We would also like to congratulate Jesus

01:40.512 --> 01:42.612
on getting his contractor license.

01:43.849 --> 01:46.416
He and his friend Wyatt have started

01:46.451 --> 01:48.518
a custom tree house building business.

01:48.553 --> 01:49.764
So if any of you are in the market...

01:49.788 --> 01:52.387
We just got business cards actually.

01:52.423 --> 01:53.723
And it's called "Out on a Limb."

01:53.758 --> 01:55.157
Nice!

01:56.894 --> 01:59.328
And last, but certainly not least,

01:59.363 --> 02:00.896
we are celebrating

02:00.932 --> 02:02.631
Eliza and Brendon tonight...

02:03.801 --> 02:06.035
who in less then a week
are getting married.

02:06.070 --> 02:07.169
Yes!

02:10.841 --> 02:12.306
Standing ovation I guess.

02:13.443 --> 02:15.610
Standing ovation from Jesus alone.

02:18.048 --> 02:20.181
Umm, we are also all very excited

02:20.217 --> 02:21.750
about the destination wedding

02:21.785 --> 02:23.684
at Beaches Resort in Turks and Caicos,

02:23.720 --> 02:25.585
courtesy of Jim and Diane...

02:25.621 --> 02:27.020
Our pleasure.

02:27.056 --> 02:29.589
Uh, we want to welcome Eliza's brothers,

02:29.625 --> 02:30.657
Carter and Jamie.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.008
And I don't think that everyone
knows our foster son, Corey.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.166
Hi!

02:39.201 --> 02:40.879
So we also thought this
would be a great chance

02:40.903 --> 02:42.668
for all of our friends and families

02:42.703 --> 02:43.983
to get to know each other better.

02:45.473 --> 02:46.806
It's kind of crazy that our kids

02:46.841 --> 02:48.074
have been dating for two years

02:48.109 --> 02:49.309
and we barely know each other.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.743
Not for lack of trying.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.011
Oh, that's on us.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.813
We've... we've been so busy traveling,

02:53.848 --> 02:55.181
- with Jim's projects...
- Yeah.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.548
... all over the world.

02:56.584 --> 02:58.517
We've barely even
been on this continent.

03:00.821 --> 03:03.554
Well, we, uh, we will have lots
of time to bond at the wedding.

03:03.590 --> 03:05.957
- Yeah.
- Um, so here's to our...

03:08.962 --> 03:10.061
Here's to all of us

03:10.097 --> 03:12.630
and the blending of our two families.

03:12.666 --> 03:13.731
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

03:13.767 --> 03:15.200
Cheers.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.474
So, my sister tells me
you got your BA and JD

03:24.510 --> 03:26.110
in just five years?

03:26.145 --> 03:27.744
Yeah. At UCSD.

03:27.780 --> 03:30.247
I'm impressed. Uh, it took me seven.

03:30.283 --> 03:32.316
Yes, I heard you're a lawyer.

03:36.822 --> 03:37.954
I feel sick.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.389
How are we gonna tell your moms?

03:41.893 --> 03:42.893
We should just elope.

03:43.895 --> 03:44.895
I'm serious.

03:45.897 --> 03:48.097
Don't worry. They'll... understand.

04:39.114 --> 04:40.725
Jesus? Thanks.

04:40.749 --> 04:42.259
Uh, so where are you looking for a job?

04:42.283 --> 04:43.615
East Coast, West Coast?

04:43.650 --> 04:46.252
Yeah, so I have multiple job
offers all over the country,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.888
but I'm going backpacking
all over Europe

04:48.923 --> 04:50.589
for a couple months before I start work.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.191
You're going to Europe?

04:52.226 --> 04:53.226
Yeah.

04:53.261 --> 04:54.261
With who?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.362
Who?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.296
No one. Um, I'm going by myself.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.298
Yeah, right.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.145
Why does no one think
I can do anything alone?

05:03.169 --> 05:05.970
'Cause you went to college
with your best friend,

05:06.006 --> 05:07.772
and you've never done anything alone.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.440
Says the guy who still lives at home.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.109
I live in the garage,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.210
and I pay rent.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.522
A hundred bucks a month is not rent.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.978
Well, I'm moving out.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.714
Emma and I found a place today.

05:17.749 --> 05:20.017
It's a studio but
after four years apart,

05:20.052 --> 05:21.885
who needs doors, right?

05:23.989 --> 05:26.123
So, are there, like, a lot of,

05:26.158 --> 05:28.491
you know, tech jobs here in San Diego?

05:28.527 --> 05:30.127
It's not a major hub.

05:30.162 --> 05:31.928
But I'll be working at a small start-up,

05:31.963 --> 05:34.430
so who knows what it might turn into?

05:34.465 --> 05:36.032
So what're your plans?

05:36.067 --> 05:38.434
Uh, well, I'm interviewing

05:38.469 --> 05:40.036
for a couple clerkships with judges.

05:40.071 --> 05:41.237
Nice.

05:41.272 --> 05:42.939
What sort of law do you practice?

05:42.974 --> 05:43.974
Corporate.

05:44.008 --> 05:45.374
I'm in downtown L.A.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.310
at Hoff, Braverman, and Tensley.

05:47.345 --> 05:49.744
Oh, well, those disenfranchised
corporations need

05:49.779 --> 05:50.819
all the help they can get.

05:53.850 --> 05:56.351
So who are the judges? That
you're interviewing with?

05:56.386 --> 05:58.719
Lisa Engleman and Curtis Wilson.

05:58.755 --> 06:01.990
I'm guessing your choice is Engleman.

06:02.025 --> 06:03.869
- Why do you say that?
- Well, she's progressive

06:03.893 --> 06:05.460
while Wilson's conservative.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.496
I am hoping to get
the job with Engleman.

06:10.599 --> 06:12.039
I'm not sure I could work for someone

06:12.068 --> 06:13.267
whose values I don't share.

06:13.302 --> 06:15.369
Well, even if that's
your job as a lawyer?

06:16.372 --> 06:18.005
How is that my job as a lawyer?

06:18.040 --> 06:20.274
Well, it's your job not
to let your interpretation

06:20.309 --> 06:21.808
of the law be clouded by ideology.

06:21.844 --> 06:24.810
Which I'm guessing you cashed
in at Hofferman, whatever?

06:24.846 --> 06:27.313
Why do you assume that all
corporate lawyers are charlatans?

06:27.349 --> 06:30.216
Why do you assume you need to
mansplain what my job as a lawyer is?

06:32.120 --> 06:34.053
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.721
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, it's okay.

06:35.756 --> 06:38.491
Umm, Aaron, this is Jamie,

06:38.526 --> 06:39.992
Eliza's brother.

06:40.027 --> 06:41.427
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

06:41.462 --> 06:42.560
Aaron's an attorney also.

06:42.596 --> 06:44.496
He works at the Juvenile Justice Center.

06:44.531 --> 06:45.864
It's a non-profit.

06:47.868 --> 06:49.934
So, how did your interview go?

06:49.970 --> 06:51.603
Fine... until...

06:51.638 --> 06:53.205
I said I was sorry.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.040
4.0 GPA,

06:55.075 --> 06:58.109
amazing recommendations
from your professors,

06:58.144 --> 07:00.044
editor of the law review.

07:00.079 --> 07:02.079
And I found your sample legal arguments

07:02.115 --> 07:04.348
well-reasoned and researched.

07:04.384 --> 07:05.749
You're an impressive young woman.

07:07.186 --> 07:10.321
Thank you. That means
so much coming from you.

07:10.356 --> 07:12.990
I have such admiration

07:13.026 --> 07:15.325
for your career and rulings.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.627
It would be an honor to clerk for you.

07:17.662 --> 07:19.562
I also believe I could
be an asset to you.

07:19.597 --> 07:22.698
As a former foster
kid who found herself,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.167
like so many foster kids,

07:24.202 --> 07:26.202
embroiled in the
juvenile justice system,

07:26.238 --> 07:28.104
I've personally experienced

07:28.140 --> 07:29.972
our judicial process from all sides,

07:30.008 --> 07:33.142
and I believe I could
provide a unique point of view

07:33.177 --> 07:34.209
in researching case law

07:34.245 --> 07:37.046
and helping shape your opinions.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.813
Well, Brandon invited
Mat to dinner tonight

07:38.849 --> 07:40.060
even though we totally just broke up,

07:40.084 --> 07:41.350
and he's a bag of dicks.

07:44.788 --> 07:46.455
So, do you have any questions for me?

07:49.159 --> 07:50.925
Well, at least she'll remember you.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.960
Not what I was hoping
to be remembered for.

07:52.995 --> 07:56.230
So, why is he a bag of... penises?

07:59.469 --> 08:02.570
Well, we dated in high
school and then broke up.

08:02.605 --> 08:04.605
And then we both went
to college in Boston,

08:04.640 --> 08:05.805
so we got back together.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.974
But then he graduated
and started playing bass

08:08.009 --> 08:09.342
with this band called "Dark Veil."

08:09.378 --> 08:11.111
Oh, I've heard of them. They're great.

08:12.647 --> 08:14.081
Uh, except for their bass player.

08:14.116 --> 08:15.148
I hear he sucks.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.594
Yeah.

08:16.618 --> 08:18.351
Big time.

08:18.387 --> 08:19.519
Anyway, he went on tour

08:19.555 --> 08:20.831
and, long story short, he came back

08:20.855 --> 08:22.721
and gave me crabs, so...

08:22.756 --> 08:24.156
bag of dicks.

08:27.661 --> 08:29.228
Real classy, Mariana.

08:46.846 --> 08:48.480
Should we open another bottle of wine?

08:48.515 --> 08:49.814
I think so, yes.

08:49.849 --> 08:52.049
I cannot believe that
you're finally home.

08:53.153 --> 08:55.520
No more counting down
the days till break.

08:55.555 --> 08:58.388
Yeah. And no stupid
fighting on the phone.

08:59.825 --> 09:01.758
Now, I can finally roll over

09:01.793 --> 09:04.394
and kiss you goodnight every night.

09:04.430 --> 09:06.230
Uh, Lena...

09:06.265 --> 09:09.199
how are you finding being
on the public school board?

09:09.235 --> 09:10.834
I... I'm enjoying it.

09:10.869 --> 09:13.336
You know, she got 79 percent of
the vote, which is unheard of.

09:13.371 --> 09:15.455
- Oh.
- But you're still the principal

09:15.456 --> 09:16.540
of that charter school, right?

09:16.574 --> 09:18.508
Anchor Beach? Yes.

09:18.543 --> 09:21.611
And you don't find that
a conflict of interest?

09:21.646 --> 09:23.078
On the contrary,

09:23.114 --> 09:24.614
it's important to have educators

09:24.649 --> 09:26.048
who are actually in the trenches.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.450
Hmm.

09:27.485 --> 09:29.485
And, Stef, you're in social work now?

09:29.521 --> 09:32.754
Yes. I run a non-profit
child welfare agency

09:32.789 --> 09:36.391
and, uh, shelter for homeless
families and abused women.

09:36.426 --> 09:38.059
Well, it's important work.

09:38.094 --> 09:39.094
Hmm.

09:39.129 --> 09:40.695
You must be so proud of your daughters.

09:40.730 --> 09:43.498
MIT and law school grads.

09:43.534 --> 09:45.478
Yeah, well, we're pretty
proud of all of our kids.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.502
It's pretty impressive
that Brandon got his BA

09:48.538 --> 09:51.238
in three years and then
his masters from USC.

09:51.274 --> 09:52.773
Uh... of course.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.908
- And you must be so proud of Eliza...
- Hmm.

09:54.943 --> 09:57.411
... being asked to join the
L.A. Philharmonic full time.

09:57.446 --> 09:58.745
Oh, we are.

09:58.781 --> 10:00.080
Though we have no idea

10:00.115 --> 10:01.882
where she gets her musical talent from.

10:05.853 --> 10:10.590
So, uh, how do you feel
about Brandon's job prospects?

10:10.625 --> 10:11.757
How do you mean?

10:11.793 --> 10:13.025
Well, you know,

10:13.061 --> 10:14.960
the entertainment
business, it's just so...

10:14.996 --> 10:16.496
I mean, it's so unpredictable, right?

10:16.531 --> 10:19.632
How many jobs are there
scoring television and movies?

10:19.668 --> 10:23.435
Well, there's are also
documentaries and training films

10:23.470 --> 10:25.571
and commercials and gaming videos.

10:25.606 --> 10:28.139
There are probably less
career opportunities

10:28.175 --> 10:31.876
in classical music, and
yet Eliza is succeeding.

10:31.912 --> 10:34.279
Well, yes, of course.

10:34.315 --> 10:37.782
But... with daughters, there's
much less pressure to provide.

10:39.985 --> 10:43.254
Is everybody ready for
some dessert? 'Cause...

10:43.289 --> 10:44.322
- Hey
- Hey

10:44.357 --> 10:45.467
I didn't know you were coming.

10:45.491 --> 10:47.024
Jesus told me to come back for dessert.

10:47.059 --> 10:49.427
Hmm. Just in time to help me.

10:49.462 --> 10:51.195
Heard you're going to Europe.

10:51.231 --> 10:53.175
You know, when you run out
of money... which you will...

10:53.199 --> 10:55.132
did you know that you
can cook in a hostel

10:55.167 --> 10:56.899
in exchange for a bed?

10:56.935 --> 10:58.635
How about I just budget?

10:58.670 --> 10:59.936
Suit yourself, but, you know,

10:59.971 --> 11:01.148
I did that for a month in Lisbon,

11:01.172 --> 11:02.983
and I learned how to
cook a killer Caldo Verde.

11:03.007 --> 11:05.007
Hmm. Why don't you just come with me,

11:05.043 --> 11:07.043
be my tour guide slash bodyguard.

11:07.078 --> 11:08.518
Probably help my moms sleep at night.

11:11.450 --> 11:13.782
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks, man.

11:13.817 --> 11:15.684
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.620
Oh, thanks for the cookie.

11:17.655 --> 11:18.787
Hey!

11:21.024 --> 11:23.191
So, you obviously haven't
told him the news yet.

11:25.229 --> 11:26.595
I don't know how to.

11:28.132 --> 11:29.397
This wasn't part of the plan.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.466
And this is totally
gonna change everything.

11:31.501 --> 11:34.168
Look, you didn't mean
for this to happen...

11:34.203 --> 11:35.203
but it did.

11:36.406 --> 11:37.739
So what if it changes things.

11:37.774 --> 11:39.807
Well, it's a big step.

11:39.842 --> 11:41.142
What if he's not ready?

11:41.177 --> 11:42.577
You've been here before...

11:43.747 --> 11:44.812
and he was on board then.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.648
And now he's older and more mature.

11:48.684 --> 11:49.684
He can deal.

11:49.718 --> 11:51.585
Or I could just not tell him...

11:52.854 --> 11:54.354
and he'll never have to know.

12:06.401 --> 12:08.620
So, how do you feel
about being a groomsman?

12:08.782 --> 12:10.983
I hear you look very
handsome in your suit.

12:11.018 --> 12:12.718
Yeah, I'm excited.

12:12.753 --> 12:14.686
Uh, thank you for asking me.

12:14.722 --> 12:16.954
So, uh, when did this happen?

12:16.990 --> 12:19.323
All my brothers are groomsmen.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.593
What do I have to do exactly?

12:22.629 --> 12:24.395
Just stand with me at the altar.

12:24.430 --> 12:27.097
And... walk one of my pretty
friends down the aisle.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.666
Oh, I can do that.

12:28.701 --> 12:30.635
I'm fly with the ladies.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.702
Yeah?

12:32.738 --> 12:35.405
- Thank you.
- Here you go, my love.

12:37.943 --> 12:39.910
You think we should tell
him about his mother?

12:41.580 --> 12:44.080
I think we should wait to see
if we have something to tell.

12:47.318 --> 12:48.752
You think Jude's okay?

12:50.421 --> 12:51.520
Why do you ask?

12:51.556 --> 12:54.557
I don't know. He just...
seems not himself.

12:56.326 --> 12:57.993
I just don't get what the hurry is.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.064
I think, maybe, after losing Grace,

13:02.099 --> 13:04.900
he's afraid of wasting any time.

13:04.936 --> 13:07.168
Plus, I don't think her
parents would approve

13:07.203 --> 13:08.636
of them just living together.

13:08.672 --> 13:10.404
Hmm.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.551
You still on the fence about her?

13:11.575 --> 13:12.874
I don't know.

13:12.909 --> 13:15.309
I thought Brandon would end up

13:15.344 --> 13:17.178
with someone more mature, I guess.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.580
Why? How's she immature?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.549
Like, there's this whole thing

13:21.585 --> 13:23.084
with the bridesmaid's dresses.

13:23.119 --> 13:25.597
Well, isn't there always a thing
with the bridesmaid's dresses?

13:25.621 --> 13:27.287
Oh, my God.

13:27.322 --> 13:29.167
Are you guys talking about
the bridesmaid's dresses?

13:29.191 --> 13:32.525
So, I had to tell my parents that I'm...

13:32.561 --> 13:34.194
sleeping in your room this weekend.

13:34.229 --> 13:35.862
So, if it comes up, just...

13:35.898 --> 13:37.363
Sure.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.132
Do they still think you're a virgin?

13:39.167 --> 13:40.700
- Mariana.
- What?

13:41.903 --> 13:44.937
No. No, they're just traditional.

13:44.973 --> 13:47.573
Um, you know, when
Brandon comes home with me,

13:47.609 --> 13:49.541
we're not allowed to
sleep in the same room.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.145
So what do you think?

13:54.916 --> 13:56.215
They're pretty, right?

13:56.250 --> 13:57.250
Lovely.

13:57.284 --> 13:58.850
Really s... sharp.

13:58.885 --> 14:00.952
And to tie everything together...

14:01.955 --> 14:03.287
we have these.

14:03.323 --> 14:04.555
Ooh.

14:05.659 --> 14:07.525
Come in.

14:09.863 --> 14:11.395
Wow!

14:11.431 --> 14:13.231
You guys look... fancy.

14:15.167 --> 14:17.267
I forgot the shoes downstairs.

14:21.273 --> 14:23.218
Listen, these were the dresses
that her mom wanted, okay.

14:23.242 --> 14:25.408
So let's just pretend
that we... like them?

14:25.444 --> 14:27.577
Why's her mom picking out the dresses?

14:27.613 --> 14:29.024
- It's her wedding, right?
- Mariana.

14:29.048 --> 14:30.125
Some things aren't worth a fight.

14:30.149 --> 14:32.248
Okay? And Eliza's parents
are paying for everything.

14:32.283 --> 14:33.950
So if they're happy, she's happy,

14:33.985 --> 14:37.253
and if she's happy, I'm happy, so...

14:38.723 --> 14:40.456
I hope these fit.

14:42.493 --> 14:44.226
Oh, uh, it's a...

14:44.262 --> 14:45.461
I... is it a beach wedding?

14:47.331 --> 14:48.408
You know, it's totally fine.

14:48.432 --> 14:50.132
We will walk on the balls of our feet.

14:54.038 --> 14:57.605
Why does it feel like your
sisters are talking about me?

14:57.641 --> 14:59.607
I'm sure they're not.

14:59.643 --> 15:01.083
Has Callie ever said anything to you?

15:02.079 --> 15:03.378
About marrying me?

15:03.413 --> 15:04.946
What would she say?

15:06.615 --> 15:08.182
Don't?

15:08.217 --> 15:10.317
Eliza, she likes you.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.055
Does she know about my parents?

15:14.090 --> 15:15.622
I... how would she know any...

15:15.658 --> 15:17.335
It just seems like you
tell her everything.

15:17.359 --> 15:21.028
Okay, well, I don't tell her everything.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.496
So you didn't tell her?

15:24.866 --> 15:25.999
No.

15:27.502 --> 15:28.735
Okay.

15:30.238 --> 15:32.605
I think someone has a crush on you.

15:38.046 --> 15:39.478
He's not my type.

15:39.514 --> 15:41.413
Because he's a corporate lawyer?

15:41.448 --> 15:42.614
Because he's not my type.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.683
Okay. Well, you don't have to marry him.

15:44.719 --> 15:45.929
When was the last time you got laid?

15:45.953 --> 15:47.519
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:47.554 --> 15:50.455
I'm just sayin'. You worked
so hard the past five years.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.290
I mean, seriously, did you date anyone?

15:53.393 --> 15:55.761
Well, after a certain
someone broke my heart...

15:55.796 --> 15:58.963
Okay, that is not how that went down.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.266
Look, weddings are like Vegas.

16:02.301 --> 16:04.235
What happens at them stays at them.

16:24.089 --> 16:25.122
I'll have one of those.

16:28.727 --> 16:29.960
Princeton?

16:31.328 --> 16:32.494
Shit. That must be tough.

16:34.065 --> 16:36.298
- What's your major?
- Classics.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.167
Like, uh...

16:38.202 --> 16:39.701
Latin and Homer and stuff?

16:39.737 --> 16:41.003
Yeah.

16:41.038 --> 16:42.972
It's a good foundation for law school,

16:43.007 --> 16:45.374
which is what my brother, Jamie, did,

16:45.409 --> 16:47.076
and he's the golden boy, so...

16:48.544 --> 16:50.979
In what world is the boy
at Princeton not golden?

16:51.014 --> 16:52.280
My world.

16:55.118 --> 16:56.450
How do you like UCLA?

16:58.188 --> 16:59.254
It's good.

17:00.757 --> 17:02.301
Best part about going
to Princeton is that

17:02.325 --> 17:03.725
it's all the way across the country.

17:05.627 --> 17:07.727
Yeah, well, L.A.'s not too far.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.174
- Do you come home much?
- Not really.

17:09.198 --> 17:11.198
I don't have a car,

17:11.233 --> 17:14.167
and, you know, it's fun
to party on the weekends.

17:14.203 --> 17:15.402
For sure.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.738
Brandon's in L.A.
though. You must see him?

17:18.773 --> 17:20.040
Not so much.

17:20.075 --> 17:23.642
Um, everyone's... really busy.

17:24.645 --> 17:26.244
So, what're you studying?

17:26.281 --> 17:29.548
I don't know. Maybe psychology?

17:30.785 --> 17:33.552
Although I hear good
things about the classics.

17:34.823 --> 17:36.289
My girlfriend's a psych major.

17:44.198 --> 17:45.763
- Refill?
- No, I'm good.

17:58.172 --> 17:59.472
Liquid courage?

18:01.009 --> 18:03.309
I'm guessing you haven't told Moms yet?

18:03.344 --> 18:05.176
I don't think now is the time or place.

18:06.446 --> 18:08.747
As long as it's before
she's walking down the aisle.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.148
It's not Eliza's fault.

18:11.184 --> 18:12.829
And, by the way, she
thinks you don't like her.

18:12.853 --> 18:15.086
I don't really know her, Brandon.

18:15.122 --> 18:16.321
No one does.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.623
Whose fault is that?

18:18.759 --> 18:21.326
I guess... hers...

18:21.361 --> 18:23.427
and yours?

18:23.462 --> 18:25.095
You haven't brought her home much.

18:25.131 --> 18:26.931
She's very shy, okay.

18:26.966 --> 18:27.999
And she's an artist.

18:28.034 --> 18:30.167
She's spent most of her
life practicing cello.

18:30.202 --> 18:32.737
She's not comfortable around
people she doesn't know.

18:32.772 --> 18:35.039
Well, we're not just
people. We're your family.

18:35.074 --> 18:38.509
Yes, but our family is loud

18:38.544 --> 18:41.077
and kind of in your face sometimes.

18:41.112 --> 18:43.112
And you can be intimidating.

18:44.816 --> 18:46.583
What do you want me to do?

18:46.618 --> 18:49.152
Make her feel accepted.

18:49.187 --> 18:50.486
You of all people should know

18:50.522 --> 18:52.022
what it feels like to not belong.

18:52.057 --> 18:53.523
I...

18:53.559 --> 18:55.391
accepted her friend request on Facebook,

18:55.427 --> 18:58.761
and I'm very generous with my "likes."

19:02.232 --> 19:05.300
If I were you, I would get it over with.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.907
So excited you guys asked us to do this.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.641
Um, we know you met at USC,

19:13.677 --> 19:16.010
but Brandon's not
really great with details

19:16.046 --> 19:19.714
and we never really asked
you exactly how, so...

19:19.749 --> 19:22.584
you know, was there a cute story or...

19:22.619 --> 19:26.054
Well, um, I had just seen him
around the music department,

19:26.089 --> 19:28.089
and I thought he was really hot...

19:29.758 --> 19:30.924
I mean handsome.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.626
It's okay.

19:32.661 --> 19:33.727
It's okay.

19:33.762 --> 19:35.228
Uh, anyway,

19:35.263 --> 19:37.530
I... I heard that he was looking

19:37.566 --> 19:39.232
for musicians to play a score he wrote

19:39.267 --> 19:41.134
in a student film,

19:41.169 --> 19:43.904
and I figured it was my
chance to get him to notice me.

19:43.939 --> 19:45.672
Oh, I'm sure he noticed you.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.673
It sure didn't seem like it.

19:53.948 --> 19:55.648
Brandon was all business.

19:56.751 --> 19:58.584
I don't think he looked at me once.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.363
Okay, uh, violins and viola...

20:00.387 --> 20:02.287
let's do a little more of crescendo

20:02.323 --> 20:03.666
in the triplet section in the middle

20:03.690 --> 20:05.857
just so it helps really build, okay?

20:05.892 --> 20:07.425
All right. Again.

20:15.869 --> 20:18.670
I didn't even think she knew who I was.

20:18.705 --> 20:19.705
Why?

20:21.073 --> 20:23.941
She was the star of the music school,

20:23.976 --> 20:26.777
and she was already playing
with the L.A. Phil part time.

20:32.918 --> 20:35.853
I couldn't imagine why she
wanted to waste her time

20:35.888 --> 20:38.955
playing in some stupid
student film score.

20:38.990 --> 20:41.090
Uh, that was really good.

20:41.126 --> 20:43.592
Uh, let... let's just
go again and try to put

20:43.628 --> 20:46.829
more crescendo in the
triplet section in the middle.

20:46.865 --> 20:48.597
But, uh... okay. Again.

20:52.203 --> 20:54.103
And the way she plays, I mean,

20:54.139 --> 20:57.639
she's so confident, so intense.

20:57.675 --> 21:00.042
And of course she's beautiful.

21:00.077 --> 21:03.812
I was so nervous that she
wouldn't find my score challenging.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.314
And then when she
wouldn't even look at me,

21:06.349 --> 21:09.484
I assumed she hated it and me.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.219
His piece was so beautiful.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.057
I couldn't believe how talented he was.

21:16.092 --> 21:18.325
But, obviously, he wasn't into me, so...

21:19.428 --> 21:21.162
After the session...

21:21.197 --> 21:23.564
I... I started to leave,

21:23.599 --> 21:25.632
but then suddenly, I marched over to him

21:25.668 --> 21:28.635
and heard myself asking to get coffee.

21:28.671 --> 21:30.003
- Thanks.
- Bye.

21:32.273 --> 21:34.507
Do you want to grab a cup of coffee?

21:34.542 --> 21:36.910
After the session, she
was about to leave when...

21:38.847 --> 21:40.880
When I suddenly just walked over to her

21:40.916 --> 21:42.326
and asked her if she
wanted to get coffee.

21:42.350 --> 21:43.550
Do you want to get some coffee?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.585
I think we were both nervous at first.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.922
Oh, do you not like your coffee?

21:49.957 --> 21:52.357
Oh, I don't drink coffee actually.

21:52.392 --> 21:54.193
Me, neither. I hate it actually.

21:56.496 --> 21:58.931
But once we broke the ice...

21:58.966 --> 22:00.599
We had so much to talk about.

22:00.634 --> 22:03.500
It wasn't just about which
professors we liked...

22:03.536 --> 22:05.603
Which dorms smelled like soup...

22:05.638 --> 22:08.172
Or music. But life,

22:08.208 --> 22:11.308
you know, and other big things.

22:11.344 --> 22:13.945
I told him how much I
loved the score he wrote.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.980
I told her how brilliant she played it.

22:16.015 --> 22:17.281
Oh, I love the way you play.

22:17.316 --> 22:19.316
Then he told me about Grace.

22:19.352 --> 22:20.494
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

22:20.518 --> 22:23.019
He was just so vulnerable. I...

22:23.055 --> 22:24.921
I knew he really knew
how to love someone.

22:24.957 --> 22:26.556
Her name was Grace.

22:26.591 --> 22:29.159
And I thought, from afar, that

22:29.194 --> 22:31.594
maybe she was full of herself,

22:31.630 --> 22:34.564
but I realized that she's just shy.

22:36.268 --> 22:37.699
Sensitive.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.468
Sensitive.

22:39.503 --> 22:40.702
Caring.

22:43.141 --> 22:44.940
And caring.

22:44.976 --> 22:47.009
He wasn't like any
other guy I'd ever met.

22:52.416 --> 22:53.948
Thank you.

22:53.984 --> 22:54.994
For the coffee, by the way.

22:55.018 --> 22:57.285
Right. Which you didn't drink.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.987
Well, it looked nice. It looked good.

22:59.022 --> 23:00.054
It was... Yeah.

23:12.301 --> 23:13.578
After Grace, I didn't think

23:13.602 --> 23:15.335
I could feel that way again,

23:15.370 --> 23:18.005
but... I do.

23:22.377 --> 23:23.377
I love her.

23:23.412 --> 23:24.544
I love him.

23:28.549 --> 23:30.850
And that's the story.

23:32.086 --> 23:33.119
It was a good story.

23:34.655 --> 23:36.889
Can't believe my baby
boy is getting married.

23:39.527 --> 23:40.827
- And so young.
- I know...

23:40.862 --> 23:41.928
Ah, listen.

23:43.664 --> 23:46.264
Your mom and I are really glad
that you found happiness again,

23:46.300 --> 23:49.667
es... especially after
losing someone that you loved

23:49.703 --> 23:51.402
so early in life.

23:51.438 --> 23:54.639
We're absolutely thrilled and honored

23:54.674 --> 23:57.809
that you and Eliza have
asked us to marry you.

23:57.845 --> 23:59.510
I really hope that
we can do you justice.

23:59.546 --> 24:01.546
You will.

24:01.581 --> 24:03.347
Thank you for saying yes.

24:03.382 --> 24:06.550
It... means a lot to us.

24:06.585 --> 24:08.552
- I love you, B.
- I love you, Mom.

24:14.793 --> 24:16.227
You think they'll blame Eliza?

24:18.864 --> 24:20.496
I think they'll be disappointed.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.466
You need to tell them

24:23.501 --> 24:24.834
they're not doing the ceremony...

24:26.104 --> 24:27.937
before they hear it from anyone else.

24:41.194 --> 24:42.861
Oh, you don't have to
do that, sweetheart.

24:42.896 --> 24:44.863
Oh, I don't mind.

24:44.898 --> 24:46.075
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Corey.

24:46.099 --> 24:47.264
You're welcome.

24:47.299 --> 24:48.832
He seems like a nice young man.

24:48.868 --> 24:49.908
How long have you had him?

24:49.935 --> 24:52.402
Oh, we've been fostering him for a year.

24:53.438 --> 24:54.872
Yeah. We plan on adopting him.

24:54.907 --> 24:56.974
- Oh! Isn't that wonderful?
- Hmm.

24:57.009 --> 25:00.310
I so admire how you've
taken in all these kids.

25:00.346 --> 25:02.246
You know, Eliza loves animals.

25:02.281 --> 25:05.414
She wanted to take in every
stray she ever came across.

25:06.617 --> 25:07.850
Mom.

25:09.653 --> 25:12.154
Hey, what're we talking about?

25:12.190 --> 25:15.791
My mother was comparing
foster kids to stray animals.

25:15.826 --> 25:18.027
It's not what I meant.

25:18.062 --> 25:20.596
I'm, uh, sorry

25:20.631 --> 25:22.208
your father and Ana
couldn't be here tonight.

25:22.232 --> 25:23.798
Oh, yeah. They are, too.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.034
Ana's, uh, eight months
pregnant and on bed rest.

25:26.069 --> 25:27.702
So I just told him to stay with her.

25:27.737 --> 25:29.371
Yeah, well, please give them our love.

25:30.473 --> 25:32.118
We had dinner with
them a couple weeks ago.

25:32.142 --> 25:33.875
- They are absolutely lovely.
- Yes.

25:35.212 --> 25:37.612
Ana's really bummed that
she can't make the wedding.

25:37.647 --> 25:40.080
But, obviously, she can't travel, so.

25:40.116 --> 25:41.916
And your grandparents
can't make it either?

25:41.951 --> 25:44.618
Oh, and here we thought a
destination wedding would be a treat.

25:44.653 --> 25:45.920
Oh, no. It is. It is.

25:45.955 --> 25:48.255
And we... we are so
looking forward to it.

25:48.291 --> 25:51.091
You know, I actually prefer
a small, intimate wedding

25:51.127 --> 25:52.726
with just immediate family.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.494
It's so much less stressful

25:54.530 --> 25:56.896
than having to entertain
all our friends.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.232
Plus, I'm pretty sure they
wouldn't much like our friends.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.934
No.

26:00.969 --> 26:02.402
Oh, yes? Why... why is that?

26:03.405 --> 26:05.171
Oh, they're really traditional.

26:05.206 --> 26:07.706
They're not nearly as
interesting as all of you.

26:09.311 --> 26:11.244
So, at weddings...

26:11.279 --> 26:13.312
... we like to do a family dance.

26:13.347 --> 26:15.580
Basically, each person from your family

26:15.615 --> 26:18.283
gets matched up with someone
of the opposite sex from ours.

26:18.319 --> 26:19.651
Yeah.

26:19.686 --> 26:22.387
Well, normally, uh, the bride's parents

26:22.423 --> 26:24.089
would dance with the groom's parents,

26:24.124 --> 26:25.657
but in this case, I thought

26:25.692 --> 26:28.026
maybe Jim could alternate
between the two of you

26:28.062 --> 26:29.462
- so it wouldn't be awkward.
- Yeah.

26:30.529 --> 26:32.489
Well, we wouldn't want it
to be awkward, would we?

26:34.367 --> 26:37.634
And, you know, as far
as the ceremony goes,

26:37.670 --> 26:40.004
Stef and I had a chance
for some one-on-one time

26:40.039 --> 26:41.216
with these two a couple days ago,

26:41.240 --> 26:43.274
and we got some cute
stories out of them,

26:43.309 --> 26:44.842
but if there's anything else, you know,

26:44.877 --> 26:46.509
you want us to add, just let us know.

26:46.544 --> 26:48.445
Well, we've already
spoken to Reverend Nelson,

26:48.480 --> 26:50.113
- but...
- Mm-hmm.

26:50.148 --> 26:52.215
... I'm sure he would
be happy to include

26:52.250 --> 26:54.784
a few anecdotes from
the parents of the groom.

26:58.390 --> 27:01.724
Mmm.

27:01.759 --> 27:04.326
So, Eliza thought they were
cool with you marrying us,

27:04.362 --> 27:06.595
but then they dropped
this bomb on her today,

27:06.630 --> 27:07.997
and she feels terrible.

27:08.032 --> 27:09.676
But I guess it's just
important to her parents

27:09.700 --> 27:12.734
that we get married by
an actual... minister.

27:12.769 --> 27:14.848
I thought you guys could do
like a special reading though.

27:14.872 --> 27:16.338
I mean, a toast or something.

27:16.374 --> 27:18.251
I mean, you guys could say
everything you were gonna say.

27:18.275 --> 27:21.442
It's just the "I do" parts, I guess.

27:21.478 --> 27:23.011
No. Honey. Honey. Absolutely.

27:23.046 --> 27:25.313
We can... we can do a
reading. That's fine, right?

27:25.348 --> 27:27.181
Yeah, yeah. You know, toast sounds good.

27:27.217 --> 27:28.516
Okay.

27:28.551 --> 27:30.229
All right, great. Thank
you for understanding.

27:30.253 --> 27:31.253
I love you guys.

27:31.287 --> 27:33.587
Yeah. Come here. Ohh!

27:33.623 --> 27:35.767
Now, you better go out and tell
Eliza that everything's okay.

27:35.791 --> 27:37.090
Okay.

27:46.635 --> 27:48.368
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

27:50.239 --> 27:52.506
You think a minister is
that important to them?

27:52.541 --> 27:54.106
Or is the ceremony just another thing

27:54.142 --> 27:56.308
we're too "interesting" for?

27:56.344 --> 27:57.510
You think they're homophobic?

27:57.545 --> 28:00.112
Well, what was all that about
dancing with the opposite sex?

28:00.148 --> 28:02.181
It's their family tradition.

28:02.216 --> 28:04.016
They're from Orange County.

28:04.052 --> 28:06.018
Probably voted for that orange man.

28:06.054 --> 28:07.619
The Twitter twit. The one whose name

28:07.655 --> 28:08.932
shall not be spoken in this house.

28:08.956 --> 28:10.156
I'm serious.

28:10.191 --> 28:12.201
I'm this far away from giving
them a piece of my mind.

28:12.225 --> 28:14.592
No. Do not ruin this wedding for B.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.327
He would never forgive you.

28:16.363 --> 28:17.728
She's the bride.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.498
And the bride's parents always
get to run the show, right?

28:20.534 --> 28:21.566
Yeah, right.

28:21.601 --> 28:23.935
And when Callie and Mariana get married,

28:23.970 --> 28:27.205
you and I get to be
Momzillas, so there's that.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.272

- Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.893
So, I don't know if you've
heard of this family dance

28:50.928 --> 28:53.229
my parents are insisting on,

28:53.264 --> 28:54.363
uh, at the wedding.

since fifth grade Cotillion.

29:06.643 --> 29:08.676
That's not a thing.

29:08.712 --> 29:10.612
You thought this charm
and grace came naturally?

29:10.647 --> 29:13.748
Oh, no. I learned it all at Cotillion.

29:13.783 --> 29:15.450
Also the waltz, foxtrot,

29:15.486 --> 29:17.385
and how to deal with massive rejection.

29:18.955 --> 29:20.421
Oh, rejection builds character.

29:22.691 --> 29:23.971
It can't have happened too often.

29:25.261 --> 29:27.772
You know what, I think there was
a compliment in there somewhere.

29:29.132 --> 29:31.532
Uh, actually, I learned
to only ask a girl to dance

29:31.567 --> 29:33.033
if I know she'll say yes.

29:33.068 --> 29:35.102
Or, you know, if she's required to

29:35.138 --> 29:37.637
out of familial obligations.

29:37.672 --> 29:40.140
So what do you say, waltz or foxtrot?

29:41.209 --> 29:42.542

That night you spent puking
after UCSD homecoming?

30:02.963 --> 30:04.173
We had to throw away the bath mat.

30:04.297 --> 30:05.964
How many have you had?

30:06.179 --> 30:09.180
So Eliza's brother says
that he has a girlfriend,

30:09.216 --> 30:12.383
but do you kinda get,
like, a gay vibe from him?

30:12.418 --> 30:13.584
Okay. You're cut off.

A... actually, um...

30:31.903 --> 30:33.202
I'm not waiting for the bathroom.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.272
I need to talk to you about Emma.

31:10.404 --> 31:11.404
Party's over?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.873
Uh, for me.

31:14.908 --> 31:17.309
Yeah. I got a lot of
work in the morning.

31:17.345 --> 31:18.655
You know, convincing the court that

31:18.679 --> 31:20.746
corporations are people, too.

31:20.781 --> 31:22.581
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you.

31:22.616 --> 31:23.782
I'll see you at the wedding.

31:25.419 --> 31:27.752
Oh, and for the record,

31:27.787 --> 31:29.186
I'm more of a waltz guy.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.833
So, what's up?

31:43.102 --> 31:45.268
Mariana told me.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.072
That you got a job offer...

31:50.342 --> 31:51.342
in India.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.445
I'm... I'm not gonna take it.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.781
Why did you apply in the first place?

31:57.816 --> 32:02.918
Bangalore is like the
Silicon Valley of India.

32:02.953 --> 32:05.031
It's a really big deal, and I
didn't think that I would get it.

32:05.055 --> 32:06.389
We had plans.

32:08.058 --> 32:09.324
Right? We had plans.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.762
And I've been waiting
for you for four years.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.096
Do know how hard that's been?

32:14.131 --> 32:16.198
Did you think that it was easy for me?

32:17.735 --> 32:20.001
Having a boyfriend back
home while all my friends

32:20.036 --> 32:23.304
are dating and hooking
up and having fun?

32:23.339 --> 32:26.541
Wow, I'm sorry that I ruined
your college experience.

32:26.576 --> 32:27.975
No! No, no, that... that...

32:29.913 --> 32:31.245
That's not what I'm saying.

32:32.282 --> 32:33.314
Hey.

32:40.689 --> 32:42.155
I want to be with you.

32:44.927 --> 32:47.294
Which is why I am not
gonna take the job.

32:47.329 --> 32:49.863
Oh, even though it's a really big deal?

32:49.899 --> 32:51.064
You could come with me.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.432
Now you want me to come with you?

32:52.467 --> 32:54.333
I wanted to go with you to Boston,

32:54.368 --> 32:55.401
and you said no.

32:55.437 --> 32:56.736
It would have been too much.

32:56.771 --> 32:58.304
For you. It would have been too much.

32:58.339 --> 32:59.939
- You didn't want me there.
- Uh...

32:59.974 --> 33:04.477
You know what, Emma? I
don't want to go to India.

33:05.747 --> 33:07.547
I... I know...

33:07.582 --> 33:10.749
that you don't take me
building tree houses seriously.

33:11.952 --> 33:13.718
But me and Wyatt, that's...

33:13.754 --> 33:16.287
this is what we are gonna
do, and we're gonna succeed.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.493
I... said...

33:22.529 --> 33:24.429
I wouldn't go. I'm choosing you.

33:24.465 --> 33:25.997
If you were choosing me,

33:26.032 --> 33:27.364
you never would have applied

33:27.399 --> 33:29.667
for this job in the first place.

33:30.670 --> 33:34.004
Just... be honest.

33:34.039 --> 33:37.541
Okay? If you stay in
San Diego with me...

33:38.544 --> 33:40.077
are you going to regret it?

33:47.986 --> 33:48.986
Go to India.

33:50.154 --> 33:51.220
Jesus, I...

33:51.255 --> 33:52.388
Go to India.

33:54.926 --> 33:56.070
You're not ready for this, Emma.

33:56.094 --> 33:57.293
It's obvious.

34:02.967 --> 34:05.968
But I can't wait for you anymore.

34:12.676 --> 34:13.676
Wait.

34:18.614 --> 34:19.813
I'm done.

34:42.203 --> 34:44.004
What are you doing here?

34:44.039 --> 34:46.039
Friends and well wishers of the family.

34:47.275 --> 34:49.308
So this is like high
school all over again?

34:49.344 --> 34:50.777
Just gonna run back to Wyatt?

34:50.812 --> 34:51.889
Dude, take it down a notch.

34:51.913 --> 34:52.978
Don't you see who you are?

34:53.981 --> 34:54.981
You're her plan B.

34:55.016 --> 34:56.815
I am a plan B who is going

34:56.851 --> 34:58.784
backpacking through Europe
with her this summer.

34:58.819 --> 35:00.753
Wyatt, I am sorry,
you're going backpacking

35:00.788 --> 35:02.955
to Europe with Mariana?

35:02.990 --> 35:04.902
No, no, no. Wait a minute,
where did you get that idea?

35:04.926 --> 35:06.458
You asked me to go with you.

35:07.795 --> 35:09.894
Dude, you're gonna be bailing on me too?

35:09.930 --> 35:11.829
No, man, it's not like we have jobs yet.

35:11.865 --> 35:12.964
We start in a month.

35:12.999 --> 35:14.866
I was kidding when I asked him.

35:14.901 --> 35:18.169
Oh, you are such a
selfish bitch, Mariana.

35:18.204 --> 35:19.236
You know that?

35:24.110 --> 35:25.242
Some people never change.

35:25.278 --> 35:27.044
And some people do.

35:27.079 --> 35:28.178
Big time.

35:29.281 --> 35:30.380
See you at the wedding.

35:36.622 --> 35:37.654
Well, that was fun.

35:37.690 --> 35:38.755
Yeah, it was.

35:38.791 --> 35:40.457
Thanks for a great night...

35:40.492 --> 35:42.625
and congrats again, Brandon.

35:42.660 --> 35:43.859
Thank you, Jim.

35:43.895 --> 35:45.394
Eliza, honey, walk me to the car.

35:46.698 --> 35:47.997
Goodnight, Brandon.

35:48.032 --> 35:49.164
See ya.

35:53.304 --> 35:54.670
So...

35:54.706 --> 35:58.207
I... had my attorney draw this up.

35:58.242 --> 36:00.609
It's a pre-nuptial agreement.

36:00.644 --> 36:02.911
I think you'll agree it's fair.

36:02.946 --> 36:05.714
I'd like you to read it and
sign it before the wedding.

36:16.930 --> 36:19.732
We have thrown so many great
parties in that backyard.

36:19.766 --> 36:22.165
I can't believe that might
have been the last tonight.

36:22.201 --> 36:23.734
When you are gonna talk to the kids

36:23.769 --> 36:25.102
about what's going on?

36:26.872 --> 36:28.538
When I'm ready, I guess.

36:31.877 --> 36:33.076
Just wanted to say goodnight.

36:33.112 --> 36:34.945
Hey, come on in, bud.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.679
Did you have fun tonight?

36:36.715 --> 36:37.715
Yeah.

36:39.283 --> 36:40.349
Anything else?

36:41.352 --> 36:42.885
Have you heard anything about my mom?

36:44.455 --> 36:46.088
Uh... we know that she had

36:46.124 --> 36:47.589
an appointment with the judge again.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.626
Did she show up this time?

36:52.496 --> 36:54.063
Umm, we haven't heard yet.

36:55.432 --> 36:56.712
Does she know you wanna adopt me?

36:58.034 --> 36:59.400
Your social worker knows.

37:01.638 --> 37:03.571
Yup. I hope she didn't show up.

37:03.606 --> 37:05.306
I want you to be my moms.

37:06.376 --> 37:07.441
We do, too.

37:09.445 --> 37:10.445
Hey...

37:13.482 --> 37:15.916
it's not that she doesn't
love you, you know that, right?

37:16.952 --> 37:18.018
She just loves drugs more.

37:19.088 --> 37:21.855
Honey, she's sick. She has a disease.

37:23.092 --> 37:24.424
But you have us.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.993
Okay? And we love you,

37:26.028 --> 37:27.661
and we always will.

37:29.064 --> 37:30.096
Okay.

37:30.131 --> 37:31.597
Hey, come here.

37:31.632 --> 37:32.932
Come here.

37:32.967 --> 37:34.133
- Ohh.
- Hmm.

37:39.941 --> 37:41.073
_

37:43.978 --> 37:45.611
_

37:45.646 --> 37:48.880
_

37:48.916 --> 37:52.550
_

37:52.585 --> 37:54.119
Hey, what you looking at?

37:54.154 --> 37:55.553
Nothing.

37:59.659 --> 38:02.160
So this wedding should be fun.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.761
Jesus isn't even speaking to me.

38:04.831 --> 38:06.797
You know, maybe I will
go to Europe with Wyatt.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.299
Just to spite Mat.

38:08.334 --> 38:10.835
Or you could just go by yourself.

38:10.870 --> 38:12.669
Not play games.

38:12.705 --> 38:14.404
Okay, are you mad at me?

38:14.440 --> 38:15.940
No.

38:15.975 --> 38:18.142
'Cause you have been throwing
shade at me all night.

38:18.177 --> 38:19.810
This...

38:19.846 --> 38:21.777
This isn't high school anymore...

38:22.780 --> 38:24.347
and you don't have to shock everyone

38:24.382 --> 38:26.015
by announcing that you've got crabs.

38:26.051 --> 38:27.750
Had crabs.

38:29.087 --> 38:30.386
I missed you, too.

38:32.858 --> 38:35.725
Look... I'm not trying to play games.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.526
It's just...

38:37.562 --> 38:39.127
I don't know, Brandon's getting married

38:39.163 --> 38:40.863
and I just...

38:40.898 --> 38:42.578
I thought that would
be me and Mat one day.

38:43.367 --> 38:44.566
It just kinda hurts.

38:49.073 --> 38:50.073
Well, yeah.

38:51.075 --> 38:52.075
Of course it hurts.

38:53.810 --> 38:55.442
We all think that we're gonna end up

38:55.478 --> 38:56.878
with our first love.

39:00.649 --> 39:01.769
You know, I just realized...

39:03.286 --> 39:05.046
your first love is
getting married this week.

39:06.622 --> 39:07.855
Is that weird at all?

39:10.093 --> 39:11.992
Well, I have loved Brandon,

39:12.027 --> 39:14.194
as my brother lot longer

39:14.229 --> 39:17.630
than... I loved him as more than that.

39:23.272 --> 39:24.905
I guess, yeah, maybe a little.
