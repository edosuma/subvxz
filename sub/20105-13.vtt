00:01.002 --> 00:02.170
<i>Previously
on</i> iZombie...

00:02.379 --> 00:04.047
That's my old boss,
Katty Kupps.

00:04.255 --> 00:07.425
Guess she was in town
working on this
Aleutian flu outbreak.

00:07.634 --> 00:10.720
We traced the first cases
to a flight from Paris
to Sea-Tac.

00:10.929 --> 00:12.013
Hello, Patrice.

00:12.222 --> 00:13.723
You recently flew
from Paris to Seattle...

00:13.932 --> 00:15.517
- Yeah?
- Girls?

00:15.725 --> 00:17.769
Carey Gold?
Patrice is your daughter?

00:17.978 --> 00:20.313
You are no longer an employee
of Fillmore-Graves,
effective immediately.

00:20.522 --> 00:22.190
- You're human?
- Yeah.

00:22.399 --> 00:24.192
Farewell bash for the ages.
You in?

00:24.818 --> 00:26.653
Zombies are abominations!

00:33.952 --> 00:37.247
<i>A spokesman from
the fire department says they
still don't have a final count</i>

00:37.455 --> 00:39.624
<i>for the number of people
killed in the explosion.</i>

00:39.833 --> 00:41.251
<i>Names of the deceased
have not yet been</i>

00:41.459 --> 00:42.961
<i>- released to family members.</i>
- Liv.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.922
<i>The six-bedroom home
was leased to employees
of Fillmore-Graves,</i>

00:46.131 --> 00:48.383
<i>a multi-national
military contracting firm.</i>

00:50.844 --> 00:52.595
They're going to be okay.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.014
Been through worse.

00:55.598 --> 00:56.766
You're alive!

00:56.975 --> 00:57.892
Oh, thank God.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.269
About damn time.

01:02.522 --> 01:03.732
Justin!

01:04.941 --> 01:05.859
Oh!

01:07.652 --> 01:08.862
- Hey...
- Hey.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.239
We were so scared.

01:11.448 --> 01:12.741
I'm okay.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.325
We're okay.

01:14.534 --> 01:15.994
We thought you were dead.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.580
Natalie's dead.

01:20.665 --> 01:24.627
Coyne and Hurley and Zack.
Most of my squad.

01:24.836 --> 01:26.463
The only reason
we're alive is...

01:26.671 --> 01:27.839
Dumb luck.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.468
So what happened
to you tonight?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.428
Where were you?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.939
Why do I have
a feeling my night's
not getting any better?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.109
I slept with Chase Graves.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.530
You... What?

01:52.739 --> 01:53.698
It wasn't me.

01:53.907 --> 01:57.327
I ate the brain of a woman
who was addicted
to anonymous sex.

01:57.744 --> 01:59.204
She'd pick men up
from hotel bars...

01:59.412 --> 02:01.831
They were all
one-night-stands,
all meaningless...

02:02.040 --> 02:03.249
You were on the brain?

02:04.292 --> 02:05.752
So, what? It doesn't count?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.337
I tried to fight it...

02:07.545 --> 02:08.838
I've been
on brains before, Liv.

02:09.047 --> 02:11.132
And you can fight them
if you really want to.

02:11.341 --> 02:12.509
Justin, please...

02:13.802 --> 02:15.220
I am so sorry.

02:21.142 --> 02:21.893
Justin...

02:23.686 --> 02:26.189
- Justin...
- Chase Graves?

02:47.877 --> 02:49.462
It's happening again.

02:49.671 --> 02:50.755
Not in the mood, Donald.

02:50.964 --> 02:53.258
Dude, you really
need to see this.

02:53.466 --> 02:55.635
Choreographer blue brain
is a big hit.

02:55.844 --> 02:57.095
We should up the price.

03:40.471 --> 03:43.516
- Hey! Where's my shipment
of Russian brains?
- Where's Tanner?

03:43.725 --> 03:46.144
There were Feds at the drop.
They intercepted our crate.

03:46.686 --> 03:48.146
- Balls.
- And Tanner?

03:48.730 --> 03:49.898
He got clipped.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.524
What?

03:55.069 --> 03:56.988
I can't find a body
for this leg.

03:57.197 --> 03:59.324
It's like the most horrible
jigsaw puzzle ever.

04:01.701 --> 04:04.495
I was not looking forward
to coming down here today.

04:04.704 --> 04:06.956
Tell me you're here to offer
a welcome distraction.

04:07.165 --> 04:09.125
I have news
on the Katty Kupps case.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.712
When we went to interview
Tatum Weckler,
remember her surly friend?

04:12.879 --> 04:15.632
- Yeah.
- Her name is Patrice Gold.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.550
She's Carey Gold's daughter.

04:17.759 --> 04:20.303
- So there's
a Fillmore-Graves connection.
- That's weird.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.138
Patrice was on
the Paris flight.

04:22.347 --> 04:24.140
So she's one of
the people Katty interviewed?

04:24.349 --> 04:27.143
And Patrice claims
she didn't see Katty
on the day she was murdered,

04:27.352 --> 04:28.144
but I don't believe her.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.146
Plus, according to Carey Gold,

04:30.355 --> 04:34.651
Chase Graves asked Patrice
to pick up his dog in Paris
and fly it back to him here.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.444
And that's gotta
mean something.

04:36.653 --> 04:39.364
I'm not sure how
bringing his dog back
would unleash the virus.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.992
Chase Graves sends
a 13-year-old zombie to Paris
to bring back his dog.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.662
Next thing we know,
there's an outbreak
of a deadly disease

04:45.870 --> 04:47.580
originating on that flight.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.249
It's fishy.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.669
What's the upside
of Fillmore-Graves introducing
a deadly virus in Seattle?

04:52.877 --> 04:56.422
Major and Justin say
there's always a shortage
of brains at Fillmore-Graves.

04:56.631 --> 04:59.342
An outbreak of
a deadly flu virus
would get them what they need.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.302
Then they really are monsters.

05:01.511 --> 05:03.304
Ooh. I have an idea.

05:03.513 --> 05:04.514
Come look at this.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.230
What if Chase
arranged for the dog

05:12.438 --> 05:14.440
to be wearing one of
these anti-barking collars

05:14.607 --> 05:16.901
that emits citronella to
train your dog not to bark...

05:17.318 --> 05:19.028
But he loaded it
with the virus.

05:19.237 --> 05:21.406
Jimmy, the Sikh,
he mentioned a barking dog.

05:21.614 --> 05:22.991
Emitting virus
everywhere he went.

05:23.199 --> 05:25.618
But how do we know he was
wearing one of these collars?

05:25.827 --> 05:27.704
He was wearing one
as of last night.

05:29.747 --> 05:30.707
How do you know that?

05:30.915 --> 05:32.041
Also, there's this,

05:32.250 --> 05:33.835
Chase Graves knew Katty Kupps.

05:34.043 --> 05:36.045
- You had a vision
of them together?
- No.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.673
I know that Chase
had Katty's room number

05:38.881 --> 05:41.342
written on a folded bar napkin
in Katty's handwriting.

05:41.551 --> 05:43.553
We know that Katty went home
with men every night.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.680
Maybe one night
she tried to take Chase home,

05:45.888 --> 05:47.515
and he lured her to her death.

05:47.724 --> 05:49.809
He could've learned she was
zeroing in on their plan.

05:50.018 --> 05:51.561
Wait. Slow down.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.521
How'd you see this napkin?

05:54.647 --> 05:57.066
How do you know his dog
had a citronella collar?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.110
I was up in his room.

05:59.319 --> 06:02.363
I met the dog.
I saw the napkin.

06:02.572 --> 06:04.032
You snuck into his room?

06:05.116 --> 06:07.035
- Liv...
- Not so much "snuck into"

06:07.243 --> 06:08.703
as "backed into
while making out."

06:10.705 --> 06:12.248
I slept with Chase Graves.

06:15.043 --> 06:16.169
I was on Katty's brain.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.296
The woman wasn't
choosy about her lovers.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.590
Thanks.

06:21.591 --> 06:25.928
Alison Connor
said she thought the house
was being used as a meth lab.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.598
We live in the
boring-ass suburbs of Seattle.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.392
Nothing wrong with adding
a bit of drama to the story.

06:51.954 --> 06:55.625
We're importing brains
from third-world countries,
war zones...

06:56.209 --> 06:59.420
Places with
too many consonants
and too much death.

06:59.712 --> 07:00.630
You say the word

07:01.297 --> 07:05.093
and Fillmore-Graves
is officially out of the
brain procurement business.

07:05.301 --> 07:09.138
You keep your hands clean, and
leave the legal risks to me.

07:09.347 --> 07:11.099
- Why don't you
flip to page 12...
- Let me stop you there.

07:12.392 --> 07:14.185
We won't be
using your services.

07:14.394 --> 07:16.729
With all due respect,
your men are hungry.

07:16.938 --> 07:19.023
- Is that so?
- They're my best customers.

07:19.232 --> 07:21.651
I'm afraid I've got some
bad news, Mr. DeBeers.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.319
More bad news?

07:23.528 --> 07:25.738
Whether it's blue brains
or normal whole brains

07:25.947 --> 07:27.448
with their
variety of personalities,

07:27.657 --> 07:28.866
they put my men in jeopardy.

07:29.075 --> 07:30.118
That's why
I've let my men know

07:30.326 --> 07:31.661
your establishment
is off-limits.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.664
They're half my business.

07:34.872 --> 07:35.998
That's not my problem.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.334
You need more brains.

07:38.543 --> 07:39.710
I know you do.

07:41.546 --> 07:44.215
I think I've got
my brain situation
under control.

07:44.424 --> 07:45.633
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:46.426 --> 07:47.635
I have work to do.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.142
Well, if it isn't Killer Abs.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.688
Restroom is
just down the hall.

08:00.231 --> 08:01.274
Lillywhite.

08:01.441 --> 08:02.692
I don't believe
we have an appointment.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.569
If you've just
got two minutes...

08:06.028 --> 08:06.904
Sure.

08:09.907 --> 08:10.908
Hell of a day.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.536
Yes, sir.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.455
You don't need to call me sir,
Major, you don't work here.

08:16.581 --> 08:17.874
I want back in.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.710
- We've been through this...
- Scratch me.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.086
Make me a zombie.

08:24.881 --> 08:27.758
We've all been through a lot.
We've lost a lot of good men.

08:27.967 --> 08:28.801
Twelve.

08:29.594 --> 08:31.053
We lost 12.

08:31.262 --> 08:33.556
You need to know what
becoming a zombie now means.

08:34.098 --> 08:36.058
- I think I do.
- Trust me. You don't.

08:39.896 --> 08:41.814
Discovery Day is on us.

08:42.023 --> 08:44.484
All those humans out there
are going to be
in for a big surprise,

08:44.859 --> 08:46.277
and no one knows
how they're gonna react.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.991
They're going to be terrified.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.536
If we're going to survive,

08:56.287 --> 08:58.581
we might have
to do a few things
that can't be undone.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.502
If I scratch you,
you better be damn sure
whose side you're on.

09:09.467 --> 09:10.676
It's not even close.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.806
Come on, Clive.
We can hear the dog.

09:16.015 --> 09:17.183
Two minutes,
and we've got our answer,

09:17.391 --> 09:18.726
doesn't matter
if Chase is home or not.

09:18.935 --> 09:20.353
We've had better plans.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.605
Ravi said even if he
changed it back to citronella,

09:22.813 --> 09:24.899
we'd still be able
to test the collar
for Aleutian flu residue.

09:28.486 --> 09:30.988
Okay. You're in, you're out.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.535
Leftover from
my first date with Justin.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.858
Hey, hey!
White Fang, remember me?

10:08.067 --> 10:09.735
Hey, there.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.157
Too much to hope
this is a booty call?

10:20.871 --> 10:22.915
Isn't that
the plushest robe ever?

10:23.124 --> 10:24.292
It's from my hotel room.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.003
Don't worry, I bought it.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.379
And I should probably call...

10:30.131 --> 10:31.841
Well, the cops, I guess.

10:32.508 --> 10:34.885
Unless you'd like to tell me
what you two were up to.

10:35.261 --> 10:36.762
We wanted to find your dog.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.933
We think you used him to cause
the outbreak of Aleutian flu.

10:47.398 --> 10:49.025
And what's my motivation
for that?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.526
Brains.

10:51.277 --> 10:54.405
You know, Harley Johns
wasn't the shooter
in the Tuttle-Reid murders.

10:56.574 --> 10:58.409
What, that wasn't the
murder weapon in his truck?

10:58.659 --> 11:01.078
It was. But he didn't
pull the trigger.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.371
How do you know that?

11:02.580 --> 11:03.873
I ate his brother's brain.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.585
I know where Harley was
at the time of the murders.
I'm his alibi.

11:07.793 --> 11:08.586
Okay.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.631
I now understand that
look of disgust on your face.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.507
You think you went to bed
with a mass-murderer.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.052
For your information,
I only went up to your room

11:16.260 --> 11:19.221
because I'd eaten the brain
of a woman who did that
sort of thing every night.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.806
Indiscriminately.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.391
I believe you know her.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.852
You had a cocktail napkin
with her phone number
written on it.

11:25.061 --> 11:26.729
Oh, so you're upset
and jealous?

11:26.937 --> 11:28.606
I don't think you
slept with her.
She was human.

11:29.774 --> 11:30.858
Does this woman have a name?

11:31.067 --> 11:32.818
Our murder victim,
Katty Kupps.

11:33.027 --> 11:36.739
She was with the CDC,
investigating how
the flu virus came to Seattle.

11:37.782 --> 11:39.825
Just a coincidence
you had her number?

11:40.284 --> 11:41.535
Maybe I should
be calling my lawyer.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.120
Are you charging me
with something?

11:44.246 --> 11:46.374
Or am I charging you
with something?
This is so confusing.

11:49.627 --> 11:50.753
We're done here.

11:51.504 --> 11:54.090
Um, your clothes won't be
ready for another 30 minutes.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.636
You wanna watch some TV?

12:06.018 --> 12:07.436
Look at this place.

12:08.062 --> 12:10.272
It's emptier than
a Glasgow pay toilet.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.275
Chase Graves
frickin' ruined us, man,

12:13.484 --> 12:15.528
banning his people
from coming here...

12:23.202 --> 12:24.328
Right.

12:32.002 --> 12:35.131
Dr. Smith, you may remember
Dr. Chakrabarti,
our pathologist.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.340
He's former CDC,

12:36.549 --> 12:38.759
we asked him
to sit in and translate
any science-speak.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.137
I don't think you'll need
much translating.

12:41.345 --> 12:45.015
In a month's time,
Seattle is looking at a death
toll in the tens of thousands.

12:47.685 --> 12:50.813
The strain has mutated
rapidly, and it's resistant
to antivirals.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.399
- Meaning?
- That if you get it,
it's a death sentence.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.234
And it's a slow death.

12:55.443 --> 12:58.571
About a month
from contracting the virus
until death.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.531
Hospitals will
run out of beds.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.451
The dying will be spilling out
into the streets.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.202
So what do we do?

13:05.411 --> 13:07.955
We need to begin
mass-scale vaccinations
tomorrow.

13:08.164 --> 13:09.206
If you don't,

13:09.665 --> 13:12.209
the death toll could reach
the hundreds of thousands.

13:16.046 --> 13:16.756
<i>Tonight.</i>

13:16.964 --> 13:19.383
<i>The Aleutian flu
hits harder than anticipated,</i>

13:19.592 --> 13:21.510
and city leaders
scramble to catch up.

13:21.719 --> 13:24.722
Hello, I'm Johnny Frost.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.475
At a news conference today,
Seattle mayor Floyd Baracus

13:27.683 --> 13:31.771
surprised most observers
by issuing a mandate that
every man, woman and child

13:31.979 --> 13:34.273
get vaccinated against
the flu virus this week.

13:34.482 --> 13:38.444
<i>Local hospitals
have now reported 125 cases
of Aleutian flu.</i>

13:38.652 --> 13:39.945
<i>Sources claim the outbreak</i>

13:40.154 --> 13:43.783
<i>can be traced to
a commercial airline flight
from Paris earlier this year.</i>

13:43.991 --> 13:46.243
You better believe that
right after roll call tomorrow

13:46.452 --> 13:47.953
I'm getting to
one of those locations.

13:48.162 --> 13:50.331
Peyton says those vaccines
are arriving tonight.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.750
- They're keeping them
at some city facility.
- Which one?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.835
She said if she told me,
she'd have to kill me.

13:55.044 --> 13:58.631
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until I've got that vaccine
coursing through my veins.

13:58.839 --> 13:59.715
Hmm.

14:00.257 --> 14:04.011
Insomnia is actually
one of the earliest symptoms
of Aleutian flu.

14:06.472 --> 14:10.226
Well, along with
unbearable sensitivity
to light...

14:13.979 --> 14:15.898
You still alive?

14:16.106 --> 14:18.943
Don't worry.
It'll all be over soon.

14:22.071 --> 14:22.988
What'd you see?

14:23.197 --> 14:25.282
Carey Gold killed Katty Kupps.

14:25.491 --> 14:27.159
You actually saw the murder?

14:27.368 --> 14:30.412
No. But Katty
was in the trunk of a car,

14:30.621 --> 14:33.582
Carey opened it up,
and she seemed surprised
to find Katty still alive.

14:33.791 --> 14:36.293
So, like we thought,
the bludgeoning happened
somewhere else.

14:36.502 --> 14:39.672
Carey was moving Katty to
the location behind the hotel.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.508
Framing Chase?
He was living at the hotel.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.676
Maybe.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.927
Let's find her,

14:45.135 --> 14:46.929
make sure she doesn't
talk her way out of this one.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.977
I'll hold the fort down here.

14:53.978 --> 14:55.020
You called for me?

14:55.646 --> 14:58.023
Yeah. Come in. Sit.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.490
I just wanted us
to take a beat.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.284
Make sure
we're on the same page.

15:08.784 --> 15:09.535
About?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.037
My recollection is
we had a plan.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.876
A plan favored by me,
favored by my predecessor.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.086
A plan to quietly build
Zombie Island,

15:19.295 --> 15:21.797
then, just as quietly,
move the entire
zombie population there

15:22.006 --> 15:23.716
once the infrastructure
was complete.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.051
- Mmm, that was the plan, yes.
- Yes.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.137
Until we switched to Plan B.

15:29.305 --> 15:31.682
The Doomsday Plan.
The plan we're following now.

15:31.891 --> 15:34.768
- The plan you set into motion
without approval.
- Me?

15:34.977 --> 15:38.230
I'm the person that
requisitions toner cartridges.

15:38.898 --> 15:42.026
You think I put Plan B
into motion?

15:42.234 --> 15:44.612
That's slightly
above my skill set.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.824
Detective Babineaux
and Liv Moore dropped by
my house last night.

15:49.033 --> 15:52.328
They think my new dog
was used to spread
the Aleutian flu virus.

15:53.454 --> 15:56.415
The same dog
you so kindly got me
as a welcome home gift.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.965
Did you really need to
kill so many zombies
to make your plan work?

16:07.051 --> 16:09.136
I guess you needed our people
frothing at the mouth,

16:10.262 --> 16:11.221
angry at humans.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.057
I'm the one that's been
preaching restraint.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.143
You must have learned
about the email Fred Tuttle
sent me earlier this year.

16:16.352 --> 16:18.604
He wanted to talk to me
when I came back stateside

16:18.812 --> 16:20.981
about a disloyal faction
inside the company.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.441
That must be
why you killed him,

16:22.650 --> 16:25.402
killed his sister,
his 11-year-old nephew.

16:27.905 --> 16:31.742
Then you laid the blame
on a bunch of Internet crazies
tracking zombies.

16:32.409 --> 16:36.205
My sister-in-law Vivian
resisted launching Plan B,
so you killed her, too,

16:36.413 --> 16:40.960
figuring that,
given the escalating tension,
the personal loss,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.711
I'd put Plan B into motion.

16:46.674 --> 16:47.758
<i>Yes, Mr. Graves?</i>

16:47.967 --> 16:49.301
Get a security detail
in here now.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.970
What are you
going to do to me?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.596
I haven't decided.

16:55.808 --> 16:58.936
It's too late to turn back
the clock on Plan B,
God help us.

16:59.603 --> 17:03.565
Maybe I'll lock you up
in a freezer until I can
put your fate to a vote.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.609
I doubt our people
will be kind to a traitor.

17:16.412 --> 17:18.455
You're the traitor, Chase.

17:18.789 --> 17:21.208
That's how it will be
written in the history books.

17:21.792 --> 17:25.629
Zombie Island would've
gotten us all killed.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.965
All of us
together in one place?

17:28.173 --> 17:29.883
Some government,
probably our own,

17:30.092 --> 17:32.761
would've nuked Zombie Island
into vapor.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.892
You and Vivian
weren't idealists,
you were cowards.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.269
Get her out of here.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.365
I don't want to mess up
my brand new office.

17:53.574 --> 17:56.869
Take him outside
behind the obstacle course
and shoot him in the head.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.580
I don't care where
you bury the body.
Surprise me.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.917
Looks like you chose
the wrong time
to clean your Glock.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.472
I just decided
what to do with you.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.891
There are more of us.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.267
Chase!

18:22.311 --> 18:23.937
Chase, put the gun down.

18:26.482 --> 18:27.900
You're a hair too late.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.276
You could've rescued me.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.738
Mutiny. Led by Carey.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.199
She was trying to sabotage
the move to Zombie Island.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.867
So the Aleutian flu...

18:37.076 --> 18:38.535
It was all about
getting more brains?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.916
For her, it was Pearl Harbor.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.375
Strike first. Strike hard.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.922
Did she kill Wally
and Anna Reid?

18:50.130 --> 18:52.257
I'm not sure
if she pulled the trigger,
but she ordered it.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.762
I believe it would be in
everybody's best interest

18:56.970 --> 18:58.555
if I take care
of this mess in-house.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.023
Be my guest.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.993
The city-wide
Aleutian flu vaccinations
are officially underway.

19:20.202 --> 19:23.330
And here
at Bell Square Church,
the mood is tense.

19:23.539 --> 19:26.166
This line wraps
all the way around the block.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.961
We've already heard reports
of some scuffling,
pardon me,

19:29.169 --> 19:32.422
as nerves fray
during the long wait
to be immunized.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.091
Pardon me,
press coming through.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.468
Clearly, people are worried
about... Pardon me.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.637
- Whoa, buddy.
- Are worried
about this deadly flu.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.514
But one thing they
should not be worried about,

19:40.722 --> 19:42.391
- excuse me,
is the shot itself...
- Hey!

19:42.599 --> 19:44.226
...which I'm
about to demonstrate.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.604
- Dude...
- Smile, sir!
You're on live TV.

19:47.813 --> 19:48.689
Hi, there.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.320
Didn't even hurt.

19:58.699 --> 20:02.161
I got the shot.
Reporting live,
Johnny Frost.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.470
You look like hell.

20:20.679 --> 20:21.889
Late night.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.265
Take a seat.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.980
I had a late night
a couple days ago,

20:30.189 --> 20:31.982
freezing my stones off
at the docks,

20:32.191 --> 20:35.360
looking for a smuggled crate
from Russia that we thought
was full of...

20:37.571 --> 20:39.406
Well, you don't
need to know that,

20:39.615 --> 20:42.034
other than it had to do
with my Russian hacker case.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.537
We've got our eyes
on this crate

20:45.746 --> 20:49.166
when a couple of doofuses
roll in to pick it up.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.961
We pounce, one gets away,
we snag the other.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.881
He's an errand boy, at best,

20:56.089 --> 20:58.300
but I need info,

20:58.508 --> 21:00.093
and he's not talking.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.638
One thing he did tell me,
however,

21:03.764 --> 21:05.224
is that he's your CI.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.644
I've had a lot of CIs.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.313
Well, let's see if
you remember this one.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.203
Now that the gang's all here,

21:26.620 --> 21:28.455
let's play Connect the Dots.

21:28.664 --> 21:31.750
Your boy Tanner
has the usual drug busts
under his belt.

21:32.292 --> 21:37.172
But flip a few years back
in his file,
and things get interesting.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.467
Teen Tanner
was a ward of the state.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.302
And his case worker?

21:42.594 --> 21:45.222
One Major Lillywhite.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.475
Curious, huh?

21:49.268 --> 21:50.185
It gets better.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.853
Tanner's one phone call

21:52.062 --> 21:54.314
this morning was placed to
Shady Plots Funeral Home.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.900
I might die. I was getting
my affairs in order.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.277
Shut up.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.280
Shady Plots...

22:01.655 --> 22:04.783
A business run by our friend
Blaine DeBeers.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.327
Brains, Blaine

22:07.786 --> 22:08.829
and Major.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.874
I'm feeling some
deja vu real hard.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.004
What the hell is going on?

22:32.811 --> 22:34.313
Clive!

22:49.036 --> 22:50.037
What the hell?

22:50.245 --> 22:51.872
He's a zombie, Dale.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.585
We live in a city
full of zombies.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.255
And you've gotta
let him go.

23:01.423 --> 23:05.218
If you put him back in jail,
you're liable to start
a zombie apocalypse.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.139
This is the same decision
I had to make with Major.

23:10.724 --> 23:11.975
Let him go,

23:13.518 --> 23:15.270
and I'll tell you
all about it.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.153
What's going on here?

23:23.528 --> 23:25.238
Remember how,
a couple months ago,
Katty told us about

23:25.447 --> 23:27.282
that mysterious plane crash?

23:27.491 --> 23:29.701
And how one of
the girls on the plane
had brains in her stomach?

23:29.910 --> 23:31.244
And how Katty learned
that that girl

23:31.453 --> 23:32.621
had been to
the same boat party

23:32.829 --> 23:34.456
where you'd been
turned into a zombie?

23:34.664 --> 23:37.292
Remember how worried we were
that Katty was getting
very close to the truth?

23:37.501 --> 23:39.961
- Yes.
- Look what the girl
had in her pockets!

23:40.170 --> 23:42.714
Boat party, read,
"Tainted" Utopium.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.467
Two vials. I found it
in Katty's box of stuff.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.511
- That's amazing...
- Not really. They were empty.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.805
But they evaporated,
so there's still residue.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.140
I probably won't
have enough for a cure,
but it's still valuable.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.433
If I can just...

23:53.934 --> 23:56.603
Here. Do the honors.
Press the release valve
for me.

23:56.812 --> 23:57.979
Sure.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.086
Ah!

25:39.789 --> 25:41.166
Could be a long day.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.501
<i>Hello?</i>

25:43.126 --> 25:44.002
Peyton, it's me.

25:44.211 --> 25:46.963
- Liv? Uh, we're swamped here,
I can't really chat.
- <i>Peyton, listen.</i>

25:47.172 --> 25:49.466
I need to know where
the Aleutian flu vaccines
are being stored.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.842
Why? What's going on?

25:51.051 --> 25:53.470
I just saw all these texts
between zombie teenagers...

25:53.678 --> 25:55.138
<i>They're saying that Seattle's
about to become</i>

25:55.347 --> 25:56.431
their personal brain buffet.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.226
That zombies
are tricking the CDC.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.936
<i>Peyton, if they</i>

26:01.144 --> 26:02.604
think they're still
about to have
all-you-can eat brains,

26:02.812 --> 26:04.147
even after the city
gets vaccinated,

26:04.356 --> 26:05.732
they must know
something we don't.

26:05.941 --> 26:07.150
<i>Maybe they're...</i>

26:07.400 --> 26:09.528
I don't know,
stealing the vaccines,
destroying them?

26:11.196 --> 26:12.489
They're at
James Doohan Elementary.

26:12.697 --> 26:13.949
Okay. I'm not far.

26:14.157 --> 26:16.117
There's police already there.
We'll try to send more,
but I'm not...

26:16.326 --> 26:17.452
Hello?

26:18.703 --> 26:19.996
Do I know you?

26:20.205 --> 26:21.414
I'll call you right back.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.669
I'm with the police.

26:25.877 --> 26:28.046
We met a few weeks ago.
Remember?

26:28.255 --> 26:29.548
Why are you in my house?

26:31.466 --> 26:34.010
Tatum, I know you're a zombie.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.806
I can't talk about this.
I can't, they'll...

26:38.014 --> 26:39.558
They can't hurt you anymore.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.309
I've got you. Just...

26:42.852 --> 26:43.770
Tell me what happened.

26:45.939 --> 26:48.525
I went to that July 4th party
with Patrice,

26:48.733 --> 26:50.860
the one where everyone
got turned into zombies.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.989
Like, a week later,
they told my dad that if
he didn't do what they said,

26:54.739 --> 26:56.408
- they wouldn't
let me have...
- Brains.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.129
I heard her on the phone.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.923
She's on the humans' side.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.592
Don't you get it?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.051
There's nothing you can do.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.636
You've already lost.

28:19.366 --> 28:20.992
Dear God...

28:52.148 --> 28:53.400
Over here!

29:22.804 --> 29:23.972
Fun date.

29:25.181 --> 29:28.226
There will be time for fun
after we're vaccinated.

29:28.435 --> 29:32.981
Aw, every great love story
starts with those words.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.233
Love story?

29:36.860 --> 29:39.154
Don't look at me
with that face.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.868
I cannot believe that
you got me to release

29:45.076 --> 29:48.997
a brain-smuggling member
of the undead.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.542
Oh, I'm sure there'll be
plenty more surprises to come.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.172
Oh, it's Liv.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.133
- Hey, Liv...
<i>- Clive, don't...</i>

30:00.341 --> 30:02.469
- Wait, wait, wait...
What did you just say?
- <i>They're...</i>

30:02.677 --> 30:04.053
<i>- Can you...</i>
- The reception
in here is terrible.

30:04.262 --> 30:05.430
Hold on. Let me step outside.

30:07.432 --> 30:09.142
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.648
Sorry, Liv. Say again?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.525
- Have you gotten immunized?
<i>- Not yet.</i>

30:17.734 --> 30:19.944
- We've been here for hours.
<i>- Don't! Fillmore-Graves</i>

30:20.153 --> 30:22.447
is infecting
the Aleutian flu vaccine
with zombie blood!

30:22.655 --> 30:24.115
Everyone who
takes the vaccine

30:24.324 --> 30:25.784
<i>is going to
turn into a zombie.</i>

30:27.368 --> 30:29.078
<i>- Clive?</i>
- Dale.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.122
Hey, stop!

30:43.092 --> 30:44.302
Clive? What is it?

30:51.518 --> 30:54.229
The coldest place
in the state?
Sunnyside!

30:54.437 --> 30:55.688
Irony, anyone?

30:55.897 --> 30:57.690
They'll reach
a high of six degrees today.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.901
The jetstream that we're
seeing here is staying...

31:00.109 --> 31:02.862
So, the new weather girl...
What do you think?

31:03.071 --> 31:05.615
- Scrumptious.
- Oh, you dog.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.535
- What's going on
with your hair, Johnny?
- What do you mean?

31:08.743 --> 31:11.704
The white streak.
You try to dye it yourself?

31:11.913 --> 31:13.248
Miss.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.333
Miss. We're live right now.
You can't just...

31:15.542 --> 31:16.709
We need to talk.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.547
Is that Olivia Moore?
In a wig?

31:20.755 --> 31:22.090
And what is it this time?

31:22.298 --> 31:24.259
Murder at the local
all-night massage parlor?

31:24.467 --> 31:26.010
You're rounding up
the usual suspects?

31:26.219 --> 31:28.930
I know why you're starving
and what you're starving for.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.183
A little privacy, please.

31:34.978 --> 31:37.063
You want to
eat someone's brain.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.107
The thought of it
makes you salivate.

31:39.315 --> 31:41.860
<i>And we're in commercial.
Johnny...</i>

31:42.068 --> 31:43.361
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

31:44.988 --> 31:45.947
Why?

31:46.656 --> 31:48.283
Why do brains sound so good?

31:48.741 --> 31:49.951
Because you're a zombie now.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.411
I'm one, too.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.747
Everyone who gets
an Aleutian flu vaccine
becomes one.

31:54.956 --> 31:55.957
This just...

31:56.541 --> 31:57.876
That can't be true.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.964
Brain mush.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.842
Gross, huh?

32:06.634 --> 32:08.052
Be my guest.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.184
Mmm.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.441
So here's what
you've got to say...

32:26.571 --> 32:28.740
And we're back.
I'm Johnny Frost.

32:28.948 --> 32:33.161
Fellow Seattle residents,
I have grave news to report.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.288
It has come to light
that every person

32:35.496 --> 32:37.999
who received the
Aleutian flu vaccination today

32:38.207 --> 32:40.293
is now in the process
of becoming...

32:41.502 --> 32:42.795
A zombie.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.633
<i>I can't stress this enough.
This is real.</i>

32:48.468 --> 32:50.303
<i>This is not a joke.</i>

32:50.511 --> 32:53.056
<i>Your future may depend on
what you do next.</i>

32:53.264 --> 32:56.601
<i>If you have not received
an Aleutian flu shot,
do not get one.</i>

32:58.186 --> 33:00.647
<i>If you do, you too
will become a zombie.</i>

33:06.694 --> 33:08.071
<i>The first sign you have
turned into a zombie</i>

33:08.279 --> 33:09.948
<i>will be a craving
for human brains.</i>

33:10.156 --> 33:11.783
Is that serious?

33:11.991 --> 33:13.159
Ah!

33:13.368 --> 33:14.661
<i>Color will drain
from your skin.</i>

33:14.869 --> 33:16.037
<i>Your hair will
begin to turn white.</i>

33:18.539 --> 33:21.751
<i>If you have taken the vaccine,
also be aware</i>

33:22.669 --> 33:26.130
<i>the zombie virus
can be transmitted
via a scratch, or sexually.</i>

33:26.339 --> 33:27.340
Ready camera two.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.634
<i>Condoms do not prevent
the transmission of the virus.</i>

33:29.842 --> 33:31.719
<i>Abstinence is
the only protection.</i>

33:31.928 --> 33:33.012
Camera two.

33:33.763 --> 33:37.475
The most important thing
for every Seattleite
to remember is this,

33:38.476 --> 33:41.145
these people are
still your friends,

33:41.896 --> 33:44.357
your neighbors,
your loved ones.

33:44.565 --> 33:47.235
<i>They have simply
contracted a virus.</i>

33:47.443 --> 33:50.238
Those who have
contracted the zombie virus,

33:50.446 --> 33:51.698
resist your urges.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.908
Help is on the way.

33:54.117 --> 33:57.745
Until then, everyone,
please stay calm.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.001
Yeah!

34:13.052 --> 34:14.345
Someone answer
the damn phones!

34:14.554 --> 34:16.055
That was great, Johnny,
you were perfect.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.057
- Imagine if
he'd been sober.
- Let's not.

34:18.266 --> 34:20.226
Every local station
has picked up the story.

34:20.435 --> 34:22.729
Well, at least it's
not just us with our wangs
hanging out.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.439
We're seeing tweets
that people were crushed

34:24.647 --> 34:26.024
trying to get out
of the vaccination queue

34:26.232 --> 34:28.151
- at the
45th Street fire station.
- Send a crew.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.236
What now?

34:30.445 --> 34:31.529
I don't know.

34:31.738 --> 34:33.364
Hey,
you can't go in there!

34:34.157 --> 34:36.325
- Excuse me...
- What fresh hell?

34:41.873 --> 34:42.540
Ah.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.959
I should've known.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.962
Sir. You and your armed men
need to leave my stage.

34:48.171 --> 34:50.089
You're one of the tribe now.
You should welcome me.

34:50.298 --> 34:51.632
Why are you doing this?

34:51.841 --> 34:54.510
Making more zombies?
You want an apocalypse?

34:54.719 --> 34:56.637
I have a video here that
should explain everything.

34:56.846 --> 34:57.972
You're going
to run this on air.

34:58.181 --> 34:59.724
Sorry, I don't
take orders from you.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.019
Any of you take orders?

35:06.064 --> 35:07.899
<i>Hello. I'm Chase Graves,</i>

35:08.066 --> 35:10.401
<i>chief operating officer
at Fillmore-Graves.</i>

35:10.610 --> 35:14.447
<i>As most of you know,
we are a Seattle-based
military contracting firm.</i>

35:14.655 --> 35:17.200
<i>What most of you don't know
is that for the better part
of two years,</i>

35:17.408 --> 35:18.701
<i>most of our support staff</i>

35:18.910 --> 35:21.913
<i>and all of our soldiers
have been zombies.</i>

35:22.747 --> 35:24.415
<i>Some would say
that's the bad news.</i>

35:25.792 --> 35:27.752
<i>I don't see it that way,</i>

35:27.960 --> 35:29.462
<i>though we understand
that this new reality</i>

35:29.670 --> 35:33.299
<i>may test the bonds of
some romantic relationships.</i>

35:33.966 --> 35:37.261
<i>Unfortunately,
intimate contact
between humans and zombies</i>

35:37.470 --> 35:39.972
<i>is impossible
without infecting
the human partner.</i>

35:40.932 --> 35:42.517
<i>We welcome new zombies,</i>

35:43.101 --> 35:46.354
<i>but that should be
a conversation
between consenting adults.</i>

35:47.814 --> 35:49.190
<i>On a positive note,</i>

35:49.899 --> 35:53.236
<i>by the end of the
day tomorrow, the Aleutian flu
will be eradicated.</i>

35:55.738 --> 35:59.784
<i>Your loved ones who were
facing a long and
painful demise will be saved,</i>

36:01.452 --> 36:03.955
<i>and no disease
will ever threaten them again.</i>

36:10.837 --> 36:14.090
<i>I suspect
the number one question
on everyone's mind is,</i>

36:15.007 --> 36:17.802
<i>where will zombies
get the brains
they need to survive?</i>

36:19.345 --> 36:20.555
<i>Rest assured.</i>

36:20.972 --> 36:23.808
<i>There are no plans
to harvest brains
from the living.</i>

36:24.016 --> 36:27.937
<i>Rather, our brains
will come to us
from across America.</i>

36:29.021 --> 36:33.025
<i>The brains, supplied to us
by willing donors
upon their deaths,</i>

36:33.234 --> 36:36.571
<i>will be processed
and distributed to
Seattle's zombie population.</i>

36:38.573 --> 36:41.284
<i>But here's the promise
we're making
to the rest of the country.</i>

36:41.492 --> 36:45.246
<i>Provide us the brains
that we need to survive, and
Seattle is where we'll stay.</i>

36:45.955 --> 36:48.708
<i>In the United States,
7,000 people die every day.</i>

36:48.916 --> 36:51.878
<i>If just one person
in 10 donates his brain,</i>

36:52.086 --> 36:54.505
<i>we will have enough that we
won't need to look elsewhere.</i>

36:55.047 --> 36:56.716
<i>Should zombies
go hungry, however,</i>

36:56.924 --> 36:58.676
<i>it's anybody's guess
where they might turn.</i>

37:01.929 --> 37:05.183
<i>Remember, a well-fed zombie
is a happy zombie.</i>

37:06.601 --> 37:10.688
<i>And our genuine hope
is that Seattle will be a city
filled with happy zombies.</i>

37:11.898 --> 37:13.441
<i>Going to PTA meetings,</i>

37:14.066 --> 37:16.569
<i>bringing orange slices
to kids' soccer matches,</i>

37:17.278 --> 37:19.530
<i>making noise
at Seahawks games.</i>

37:20.531 --> 37:23.910
<i>Of course, the human citizens
of Seattle are free to leave.</i>

37:24.118 --> 37:26.412
<i>But we hope that you will stay
and live in harmony</i>

37:26.621 --> 37:28.539
<i>- with your
new zombie neighbors.</i>
- Take cover!

37:28.748 --> 37:31.334
- Move, move!
- <i>Zombies
are not monsters.</i>

37:32.335 --> 37:35.338
<i>The last thing we want to do
is harm our human
brothers and sisters.</i>

37:36.214 --> 37:38.925
One round above their heads.
On me.

37:39.342 --> 37:40.593
Fire!

37:43.221 --> 37:44.805
<i>We are all in this together.</i>

37:45.973 --> 37:48.893
<i>Let's show the world there's
no need to fear the other.</i>

37:49.101 --> 37:50.353
Aim...

37:55.900 --> 37:57.526
Take 'em down.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.780
<i>While Seattle
will be under zombie control,</i>

38:00.988 --> 38:03.532
<i>most of you living here
will experience
very little change.</i>

38:05.326 --> 38:07.787
<i>The established infrastructure
will continue to function,</i>

38:07.995 --> 38:10.957
<i>its city government,
its schools,</i>

38:11.165 --> 38:13.167
<i>firehouses, police department,</i>

38:13.834 --> 38:16.504
<i>with a special
zombie police force
and criminal justice system</i>

38:16.712 --> 38:18.673
<i>to handle crimes
involving zombies.</i>

38:18.881 --> 38:20.049
<i>Thank you for listening.</i>

38:20.591 --> 38:23.344
<i>Continue watching
for a list of locations
where brains can be procured.</i>

38:28.015 --> 38:29.642
So that's your plan?

38:29.850 --> 38:31.769
Holding the country
hostage for its brains?

38:32.812 --> 38:34.021
The brains of their dead.

38:35.648 --> 38:36.315
But yes.

38:36.524 --> 38:38.734
So the Aleutian flu was never
about harvesting brains.

38:38.943 --> 38:41.487
It was about getting
as many people turned into
zombies as possible.

38:41.696 --> 38:43.823
You can stop judging me now.
I didn't put this plan
into action.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.493
I suppose I could've let
everyone with
the Aleutian flu die.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.664
I wish I had the luxury
of hoping we could
all just get along.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.504
Have I mentioned
how much I like your new look?

38:58.713 --> 39:00.047
I'm glad you
finally got on board.

39:09.140 --> 39:12.101
What's it like out there
for someone rocking
the old-school zombie look?

39:12.310 --> 39:13.853
Lots of moving trucks
heading out of the city,

39:14.061 --> 39:15.438
and it seemed like
every driver

39:15.646 --> 39:17.982
only slowed down long enough
to flip me the bird.

39:18.858 --> 39:20.234
How's it going here?

39:20.443 --> 39:21.610
You look like
you haven't slept.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.322
Ta-da!

39:24.530 --> 39:26.157
You invented the sugar cube.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.784
I harvested just enough
tainted Utopium

39:28.993 --> 39:30.911
to try something
I've been tinkering with

39:31.120 --> 39:33.414
ever since I lied to the
zombie truthers about this.

39:35.124 --> 39:38.377
That, my friend,
is a vaccine for zombie-ism.

39:38.586 --> 39:39.920
No freaking way!

39:40.796 --> 39:41.589
You did it?

39:41.797 --> 39:43.883
Oh, I don't know. Maybe.
I think. I dunno. Who knows?

39:44.091 --> 39:46.010
If my math was right.
Let's see how it goes.

39:47.928 --> 39:50.056
Dude! You're gonna be
your own guinea pig?

39:50.264 --> 39:51.849
How're you gonna know
if it works?

39:52.058 --> 39:53.142
I'm glad you asked.

39:53.351 --> 39:54.518
What? Why?

39:59.273 --> 39:59.940
No.

40:00.816 --> 40:01.692
Ravi.

40:02.943 --> 40:05.196
I don't want to be responsible
if it doesn't work.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.907
You won't be.
I'm asking you to do this.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.575
Ask Major.

40:09.784 --> 40:12.161
I don't think he has
much use for humans anymore.

40:12.370 --> 40:13.579
I want it to be you.

40:18.709 --> 40:20.086
This morgue...

40:22.004 --> 40:24.340
This is where it all started.
Remember?

40:27.218 --> 40:29.512
I caught you
eating brains in my office.

40:30.596 --> 40:31.889
You were this...

40:32.098 --> 40:33.974
Bright, mopey girl,

40:34.183 --> 40:37.061
so sad because she
couldn't be a cardiologist,

40:38.354 --> 40:39.563
and look at you now.

40:41.732 --> 40:45.486
So sad because my friend
wants me to turn him
into a zombie.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.739
What I want,
more than anything,

40:49.615 --> 40:52.284
is to feel like I left
the world a better place.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.122
And that for doing so,

40:56.330 --> 40:59.959
I was richly rewarded
with a medical patent
worth billions of dollars.

41:00.167 --> 41:02.670
Which I would then
drop into the ghettos,

41:02.878 --> 41:05.548
barrios and favelas
of the world
from my helicopter

41:05.756 --> 41:08.426
with Chakrabarti
painted down the side.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.720
- Chakrabarti!
- I love you, Ravi.

41:16.225 --> 41:17.768
I love you, too, Liv.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.771
Give me that arm.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.861
Are you sure?

41:28.571 --> 41:29.864
I'm sure.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.261
Don't be a dick.
