WEBVTT

00:00.036 --> 00:01.910
Previously, on <i>Royal Pains</i>

00:01.911 --> 00:02.783
you let a billionaire hospital

00:02.784 --> 00:05.454
trusting in save some kids off the streets.

00:05.455 --> 00:06.360
I've made a judgment call.

00:06.361 --> 00:07.225
You've made a mistake.

00:07.226 --> 00:09.649
Why don't you tell Hank
that you're doing shifts at hospital?

00:09.650 --> 00:10.889
I was going to.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.076
But then I though <i>why bother him</i> ?

00:12.077 --> 00:13.582
Eric, please meets everyone.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.977
Is Divya, Jill, Hank and Evan.

00:15.978 --> 00:17.415
This is Eric Kassabian.

00:18.826 --> 00:20.074
Mom!

00:21.248 --> 00:22.381
Oh my God!

00:22.382 --> 00:23.135
What happened?

00:23.136 --> 00:24.299
Someone's have a fall.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.127
My husband's campaign
is very important to him.

00:27.186 --> 00:28.602
Winning will make him happy.

00:28.603 --> 00:30.532
When was the last time you felt happy?

00:30.533 --> 00:32.310
Lately, her depression
seems to have deepened.

00:32.311 --> 00:34.542
Hanks saw Mrs. Collins? He treated her?

00:34.543 --> 00:35.906
How could you not know this?

00:35.907 --> 00:37.989
I'm bound by doctor- patient
confidentiality.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.634
Do not pull that doctor crap.

00:39.635 --> 00:40.808
I'm your brother!

00:40.809 --> 00:42.169
You ruined it!

00:43.116 --> 00:44.357
What are you doing here, Lawson?

00:44.358 --> 00:46.117
I'm here because I
want to help your wife.

00:46.118 --> 00:47.750
She's does need your help.

01:07.663 --> 01:09.215
Daddy, the latest poll

01:09.216 --> 01:10.915
has you within five points of Crawford.

01:10.916 --> 01:12.285
Yeah, five points of Crawford

01:12.286 --> 01:13.705
bought with Hollywood's money.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.361
And we'll buy 'em back tonight

01:15.362 --> 01:17.154
with a whole lot of wall street's.

01:17.155 --> 01:19.510
Yeah. I love it when he talks like that.

01:19.511 --> 01:21.065
Okay, do you wanna go over the schedule?

01:21.066 --> 01:22.698
Yeah, let's see, uh...

01:23.119 --> 01:24.545
Radio tour today.

01:24.546 --> 01:25.792
Fundraiser tonight.

01:25.793 --> 01:27.232
Book signing tomorrow.

01:27.446 --> 01:28.470
Sweetheart...

01:29.472 --> 01:30.503
You want to, uh,

01:30.504 --> 01:32.338
come into the city for the book signing?

01:32.339 --> 01:33.822
Oh, honey, I don't think so.

01:33.823 --> 01:36.815
It might be... good for you.

01:37.872 --> 01:39.696
Why don't I go on mom's behalf?

01:41.932 --> 01:43.359
Be nice to have you there.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.904
Why don't you come along too?

01:45.099 --> 01:46.323
Who, me?

02:03.061 --> 02:04.396
How was London?

02:04.577 --> 02:06.865
Saint Martins blew my mind.

02:06.903 --> 02:07.929
Really?

02:07.930 --> 02:08.991
A bunch of kids?

02:08.991 --> 02:10.490
Students. I'm telling you that...

02:10.491 --> 02:12.646
Institutions are the future of art.

02:12.647 --> 02:13.606
Oh, I've said that before?

02:13.607 --> 02:15.012
Yeah, once or twice.

02:15.013 --> 02:17.496
Plus, I'm obsessed
with the British accent.

02:17.575 --> 02:19.293
Make me feel smarter.

02:19.294 --> 02:21.301
Well, Eric, if you're
not happy to be home,

02:21.302 --> 02:22.750
you will be in a minute.

02:23.624 --> 02:24.486
Is she here?

02:24.487 --> 02:26.386
Installed and ready for unveiling.

02:26.387 --> 02:28.361
Well, almost. The lighting's in,

02:28.362 --> 02:30.162
but the curtain's still on manual.

02:30.594 --> 02:31.347
Megan...

02:31.348 --> 02:32.601
It's a big moment for me.

02:32.602 --> 02:34.138
Yeah, I know.

02:34.977 --> 02:36.641
And you want to enjoy it alone.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.760
Call you when the moment's over?

03:03.105 --> 03:04.538
Lights on.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.122
Morning.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.502
Hey! Now we're only one Hank med member

04:08.503 --> 04:10.115
short of a staff meeting.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.391
I think that we may remain short.

04:12.601 --> 04:15.010
This was hanging on the front door.

04:16.113 --> 04:18.279
Either Boris's baby is punking us,

04:18.281 --> 04:20.170
or that's Evan's handwriting.

04:20.171 --> 04:21.728
Well, if you came by to hang the sign,

04:21.728 --> 04:23.664
he didn't stop in to say hello.

04:23.737 --> 04:25.441
Oh, the corporate intrigue continues.

04:25.442 --> 04:27.105
He's still pissed at me
for keeping him in the dark

04:27.106 --> 04:28.635
about Paige's mom.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.912
It's a tough one.

04:29.913 --> 04:30.772
For both of you.

04:30.773 --> 04:32.614
Yeah, and I still feel awful about it.

04:32.615 --> 04:34.861
I mean, we've never kept
secrets from each other.

04:34.862 --> 04:36.074
Eventually, Evan is gonna see

04:36.075 --> 04:38.782
that you were only trying
to help a family in need.

04:38.783 --> 04:40.904
He can't blame you for that.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.004
Listen, sometimes...

04:43.665 --> 04:46.226
Sometimes, secrets are necessary.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.658
I got a call from Raina Saluja.

04:55.970 --> 04:58.246
Yeah, yeah. New patient.

04:58.247 --> 05:00.547
Recurring tonsillitis.

05:00.548 --> 05:02.292
Yeah, I scheduled her
for surgery tomorrow.

05:02.293 --> 05:03.982
Oh, yeah, I saw that in her chart.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.006
Does she need her records
sent to the hospital?

05:06.007 --> 05:07.469
She needs a ride to the hospital.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.703
Evan scheduled that part.

05:08.704 --> 05:10.453
And I think she needs to
make a stop on the way.

05:10.454 --> 05:11.950
Pick up a few things.

05:12.607 --> 05:13.871
Then go home

05:13.872 --> 05:15.568
and get some rest.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.273
Yeah.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.154
All right, Hank...

05:23.155 --> 05:24.683
Yeah, this is Hank.

05:27.123 --> 05:28.298
Yeah.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.616
Okay.

05:47.893 --> 05:49.326
And that's it.

05:50.775 --> 05:52.719
As a diabetic, you're gonna
have to keep a close eye

05:52.720 --> 05:54.233
on this wound.

05:54.234 --> 05:55.915
You're gonna feel a little prick.

05:57.808 --> 05:59.352
Poor circulation.

05:59.522 --> 06:00.803
Slow healing.

06:01.019 --> 06:02.515
Possible infection.

06:03.575 --> 06:05.535
And all the perks.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.357
95, normal fasting glucose level.

06:09.972 --> 06:11.946
So tell me what happened.

06:12.046 --> 06:13.112
You want the long version?

06:13.113 --> 06:14.648
The longer the better.

06:14.728 --> 06:16.828
So I opened the curtain and fainted.

06:16.829 --> 06:19.069
Can you repeat that... slowly?

06:19.664 --> 06:21.425
It all started when I was
unveiling the painting

06:21.426 --> 06:24.107
and, uh, threw my back out.

06:24.670 --> 06:25.994
Hey, do you want to see her?

06:25.995 --> 06:28.020
- Who?
- Isabella.

06:28.772 --> 06:31.100
She's...Breathtaking.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.106
Yeah, sure.

06:50.929 --> 06:52.320
Wow.

06:53.728 --> 06:55.903
It's very impressive.

07:18.943 --> 07:20.783
Yeah, she...

07:21.263 --> 07:22.855
She is.

07:27.168 --> 07:28.448
You okay?

07:29.632 --> 07:31.097
No.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.073
Okay, you can get up now.

08:18.203 --> 08:21.451
This eeg will rule out a seizure.

08:21.846 --> 08:24.174
A hypoglycemic seizure?

08:24.175 --> 08:26.650
Hypoglycemic seizures
don't show up on an eeg.

08:26.651 --> 08:29.116
I'm considering a type of epilepsy.

08:29.822 --> 08:32.150
But, yes, it could be
diabetes-related, too,

08:32.150 --> 08:33.285
if that's what you were asking.

08:33.287 --> 08:35.312
A.K.A., a progression of my disease.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.767
Your visual symptoms could indicate

08:37.768 --> 08:39.376
retinopathy,

08:39.828 --> 08:41.556
a known complication.

08:44.134 --> 08:47.165
I chased that painting around the world

08:47.961 --> 08:49.665
for 15 years...

08:51.063 --> 08:52.512
If I go blind...

08:53.608 --> 08:55.746
Then I don't get to look at it again,

08:55.747 --> 08:57.354
at any of my art again.

08:57.355 --> 08:59.507
Eric, you're taking a big leap there.

08:59.508 --> 09:00.908
Once this disease goes bad,

09:00.909 --> 09:02.797
it goes bad pretty quickly.

09:05.861 --> 09:09.861
Okay, um, want you to
look straight ahead for me.

09:11.837 --> 09:12.885
Okay.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.269
Well, I don't see any hemorrhages.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.932
Any, uh, blurry vision or spots lately?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.708
- No.
- Good, okay.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.047
I'm gonna have you see an ophthalmologist

09:22.048 --> 09:23.678
at Hamptons heritage for a retinal exam,

09:23.679 --> 09:25.039
just to be safe.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.115
And, while you're there,

09:26.116 --> 09:27.932
I want you to get an MRI of your back.

09:27.933 --> 09:28.929
An MRI?

09:28.930 --> 09:30.604
You could have a radiculopathy...

09:30.605 --> 09:33.307
Or pinched nerve... from
pulling that curtain open.

09:33.308 --> 09:36.043
Or it could be a neuropathy,
common among diabetics

09:36.044 --> 09:38.543
with decreased blood flow to spinal nerves.

09:38.544 --> 09:41.160
Oh, wonderful. A new perk.

09:41.558 --> 09:43.095
Delightful.

10:02.264 --> 10:04.980
Okay, please just... not here.

10:04.981 --> 10:06.462
I need half a windshield.

10:06.463 --> 10:08.441
I left my nine iron behind, okay?

10:08.442 --> 10:10.163
Okay. Good.

10:11.729 --> 10:12.917
So, what?

10:12.918 --> 10:14.342
Did I do something else wrong?

10:14.343 --> 10:16.668
You did pretty much
everything wrong, Hank.

10:16.669 --> 10:18.140
- Okay.
- Except for one thing.

10:18.611 --> 10:19.829
And what's that?

10:20.055 --> 10:21.175
Ellen.

10:21.529 --> 10:22.880
She's definitely not well.

10:22.881 --> 10:24.730
So you were right about that part.

10:24.731 --> 10:25.596
Yeah.

10:25.597 --> 10:28.021
Meanwhile, the general
just charges ahead and...

10:28.915 --> 10:30.677
Paige holds it all together.

10:30.678 --> 10:32.561
What about
the prescription I left?

10:32.562 --> 10:33.950
And the appointment I made
for her with Dr. Chrissy?

10:33.951 --> 10:35.338
Ellen's tried every drug.

10:35.339 --> 10:37.389
She's tried every type of
counseling there is, basically.

10:37.390 --> 10:38.309
If she's gonna try treatment again,

10:38.310 --> 10:40.493
- it's gotta be something new.
- Right.

10:42.306 --> 10:43.651
She needs hope.

10:44.496 --> 10:46.360
Like real hope.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.028
I happen to have an old friend

10:48.029 --> 10:50.150
who specializes in that area.

10:50.866 --> 10:52.780
I'll make an appointment 
to go see her.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.504
Great. Where does she practice?

10:55.505 --> 10:57.512
Brooklyn Heights Mercy Hospital.

10:59.595 --> 11:01.342
You sure you wanna show up there?

11:01.343 --> 11:03.127
You sure you even can show up there?

11:03.658 --> 11:05.089
I guess we'll find out.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.668
Are you sure
that you need this much stuff

11:09.669 --> 11:11.678
for one night in the hospital?

11:12.097 --> 11:14.806
Well... as a public figure.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.711
I'm used to a certain level of comfort.

11:17.712 --> 11:18.833
Yes.

11:20.057 --> 11:24.120
Yes, I understand that you've
been in a few Bollywood films.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.584
Um, heh, a few dozen.

11:27.098 --> 11:30.456
I came here last year to
introduce myself to Broadway.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.329
Diversify my following.

11:32.348 --> 11:34.676
And then these recurring
throat infections happened,

11:34.677 --> 11:38.103
and...
every audition has been a disaster.

11:38.104 --> 11:38.900
I thought hardly anyone

11:38.901 --> 11:40.991
actually sang their own songs in Bollywood.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.008
Yes, hardly anyone but me.

11:43.317 --> 11:44.925
That's how I made my name.

11:45.109 --> 11:47.405
Now, I'm going to have to
make it all over again.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.816
Good.

11:53.817 --> 11:54.961
Okay.

11:55.571 --> 11:58.949
The hospital's admitting process
will be a breeze after this.

11:59.044 --> 12:00.196
Process?

12:00.379 --> 12:02.669
I thought the whole point
of concierge medicine

12:02.670 --> 12:04.581
was to avoid the process.

12:04.582 --> 12:06.177
You know what,
should we just call Hank?

12:06.178 --> 12:07.745
That won't be necessary.

12:07.765 --> 12:08.946
I assure you, Raina,

12:08.947 --> 12:11.379
I will have you and your steamer trunk

12:11.380 --> 12:13.188
squared away in no time.

12:36.774 --> 12:38.614
Oh. Hold on, please.

12:39.084 --> 12:41.284
Hey. What are you up to?

12:42.358 --> 12:44.758
I'm in the city, trying to park.

12:47.136 --> 12:48.791
You know, in the Hamptons,

12:48.792 --> 12:51.520
people leave you more than
two inches between bumpers.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.969
What's in the city?

12:53.254 --> 12:54.491
My successor.

12:54.492 --> 12:56.164
At least, I think so.

12:56.165 --> 12:57.838
I just need to convince him.

12:57.839 --> 13:00.096
Well, good luck trying
to replace yourself.

13:00.097 --> 13:01.789
Mm, thanks, Divya.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.767
Hey, what are you up to?

13:03.768 --> 13:06.822
I am chauffeuring a
patient to the hospital.

13:06.823 --> 13:08.088
Perfect.

13:08.089 --> 13:09.857
I need to ask a favor.

13:09.858 --> 13:12.016
We're short-staffed tonight,
and I was hoping that...

13:12.017 --> 13:13.736
Oh, of course I'll take an extra shift.

13:13.737 --> 13:15.200
Thanks, thanks a lot.

13:15.201 --> 13:17.480
You know I need the money anyway.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.871
I'll keep asking you for
as many favors as I can.

13:23.763 --> 13:24.948
Good luck...

13:26.030 --> 13:27.455
To the both of us.

13:35.939 --> 13:37.171
Hello there.

13:37.271 --> 13:38.697
Hey, Hank. Come in.

13:38.698 --> 13:39.554
Hey, Abby.

13:39.555 --> 13:40.769
Hi.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.967
Thank you for squeezing me in.

13:42.992 --> 13:44.906
You got a very crowded
waiting room out there.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.399
Well, times are tough,

13:46.400 --> 13:47.659
so business is good.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.771
Right.

13:48.772 --> 13:50.509
Sit down. How are you doing?

13:50.510 --> 13:52.773
I'm doing great. Doing great.

13:53.691 --> 13:54.787
How 'bout you?

13:54.980 --> 13:57.804
Fine...
but let's keep this on you.

13:58.233 --> 13:59.625
Uh, okay.

13:59.668 --> 14:00.579
You know, I have to say,

14:00.580 --> 14:03.903
I was surprised to see
your name on my schedule.

14:04.602 --> 14:06.349
It must have taken a lot of courage

14:06.350 --> 14:07.338
for you to come here.

14:07.339 --> 14:08.559
Oh, well, you know, I wouldn't let pride

14:08.560 --> 14:10.593
stand in the way of asking for help.

14:11.174 --> 14:13.597
Well, let's start anywhere you'd like.

14:14.889 --> 14:16.136
Uh, Abby...

14:16.295 --> 14:17.272
Yes.

14:17.403 --> 14:18.353
Are you under the impression

14:18.354 --> 14:20.259
that I came to see you
as a patient?

14:21.311 --> 14:22.429
Well...

14:22.430 --> 14:24.201
With everything you went through...

14:24.202 --> 14:25.403
Oh, God.

14:25.722 --> 14:26.753
I don't know.

14:27.015 --> 14:29.353
You seemed very anxious on the phone.

14:29.354 --> 14:31.023
Yeah, I've got a lot on my mind.

14:31.024 --> 14:34.590
But I recovered just fine
from all I went through.

14:34.591 --> 14:35.946
Thank you.

14:36.647 --> 14:39.847
So if you're not here
to talk about yourself...

14:40.052 --> 14:45.629
I, um, I have a patient who may
be a good candidate for RTMS.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.086
Female, early 50s.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.314
History of depression.

14:49.315 --> 14:50.350
She's tried several meds,

14:50.351 --> 14:53.217
but none with long-term efficacy.

14:53.218 --> 14:55.347
She's not right for it.

14:55.348 --> 14:56.539
Oh.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.502
Really?

14:57.503 --> 14:58.899
'Cause I read a few studies

14:58.900 --> 15:00.643
that called RTMS a promising

15:00.644 --> 15:03.667
and non-invasive method
of hyper-polarization.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.235
You're still very thorough, Hank.

15:05.236 --> 15:07.246
Almost annoyingly so.

15:07.895 --> 15:10.088
Damn, I really aim for irritation.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.591
First of all, RTMS is more effective

15:12.592 --> 15:14.418
earlier in the course of treatment,

15:14.419 --> 15:16.537
and it's a more viable alternative

15:16.538 --> 15:19.778
for patients who have only
failed a single drug regimen.

15:20.915 --> 15:22.019
Okay.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.705
Any other ideas?

15:25.190 --> 15:26.315
Abby...

15:27.154 --> 15:28.874
This woman is desperate.

15:43.002 --> 15:44.074
You paged me?

15:44.274 --> 15:45.427
Riley, meet Divya.

15:45.428 --> 15:47.029
- She works for me.
- Hi.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.879
He says, "hi, big fan of your boss."

15:48.880 --> 15:50.449
What happened to him, doctor?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.447
Lockjaw.

15:51.448 --> 15:54.235
The new $8.00 burger at Toddy B's.

15:54.236 --> 15:55.630
The size of a smart car.

15:55.631 --> 15:56.872
Schedule him for oral surgery.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.508
You could relocate it manually.

15:58.509 --> 16:01.680
Even a shot of midazolam
can break the muscle spasms.

16:01.681 --> 16:04.151
Can you handle the labs and the EKG for me?

16:04.152 --> 16:05.153
Of course.

16:05.154 --> 16:08.850
But first,
could I suggest an alternative?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.432
It may prevent the use of intubation

16:11.433 --> 16:13.432
and paralyzing agents.

16:13.733 --> 16:15.052
I'm listening.

16:21.812 --> 16:24.490
I read about this in a
British peer-review journal.

16:25.489 --> 16:26.437
It's worth a shot.

16:26.438 --> 16:29.282
So your thought leaders
in the field of dentistry

16:29.283 --> 16:30.611
are the brits?

16:33.661 --> 16:34.716
Riley.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.252
I'm going to gently wedge these

16:37.253 --> 16:39.142
between your upper and lower teeth.

16:39.143 --> 16:41.696
Then I will periodically add more,

16:41.697 --> 16:42.749
further opening your jaw,

16:42.750 --> 16:45.125
until the muscles relax, hopefully.

16:46.261 --> 16:48.452
Trust me, it beats surgery.

16:48.453 --> 16:50.133
Sounds like it's worth a shot.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.039
Get to it, Katdare.

16:52.355 --> 16:54.018
I'll go talk to the parents.

17:01.655 --> 17:03.294
I'll be right back, Riley.

17:31.752 --> 17:33.887
Uh...Eric?

17:38.971 --> 17:40.252
Are you okay?

17:40.316 --> 17:42.301
Memorizing Isabella.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.658
If I lose my vision,

17:45.174 --> 17:47.080
I don't want to lose
what matters most to me.

17:47.081 --> 17:48.569
Well, Eric...

17:48.738 --> 17:50.899
Your eeg was negative.

17:51.008 --> 17:52.297
And the ophthalmologist you saw

17:52.298 --> 17:54.641
found no indication of retinopathy.

17:54.642 --> 17:55.911
Yeah, but they found no explanation

17:55.912 --> 17:57.336
for what I was seeing either.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.080
And neither have I, yet.

17:59.081 --> 18:01.217
But let's go one step at a time here.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.834
And what is the next step?

18:03.046 --> 18:05.374
Well, the MRI did confirm
that your back pain

18:05.375 --> 18:07.139
is from a radiculopathy.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.504
I'm having a really difficult time

18:08.505 --> 18:09.895
taking that word seriously.

18:10.568 --> 18:11.929
It's, uh, it's not life-threatening,

18:11.930 --> 18:13.077
but because of your diabetes,

18:13.078 --> 18:14.019
you'll have to go to Hamptons heritage

18:14.020 --> 18:15.573
for the steroid treatment.

18:15.574 --> 18:16.520
That's it?

18:16.521 --> 18:17.577
For now.

18:17.758 --> 18:18.845
That's it.

18:24.379 --> 18:27.259
So how'd you get so into
art in the first place?

18:27.260 --> 18:28.614
Elaina Minatoly.

18:28.615 --> 18:30.224
I'm not familiar with her work.

18:30.225 --> 18:31.914
I'm glad, 'cause she was
my college girlfriend.

18:31.915 --> 18:33.419
Oh. Heh. Okay.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.271
I chased her for four years,

18:35.272 --> 18:37.723
and finally won her over her senior year.

18:37.724 --> 18:38.930
Once we graduated,

18:38.931 --> 18:40.526
she went to study in Florence.

18:40.527 --> 18:42.086
I chased her there too.

18:42.835 --> 18:44.372
You can guess
how that one ended up for me.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.358
She, uh, she broke your heart.

18:46.602 --> 18:49.065
She just left me standing there.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.679
Right on the Ponte Vecchio.

18:52.425 --> 18:54.889
You know, it was the best thing
she had ever done for me.

18:55.350 --> 18:57.567
Because I fell in love all over again.

18:57.639 --> 18:58.734
With art?

18:58.792 --> 19:00.158
Many times,

19:00.159 --> 19:02.306
from paintings to sculptures to...

19:02.307 --> 19:04.523
Murals and frescos.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.622
Every one of them, breathtaking.

19:07.570 --> 19:10.991
Eric, this... this feeling of
having your breath taken away.

19:10.992 --> 19:13.077
Does it happen often when
you look at great art?

19:13.078 --> 19:15.149
Well, isn't that the
definition of great art?

19:15.272 --> 19:17.009
Something that sweeps you off your feet?

19:17.010 --> 19:19.145
Makes you weak in the knees?

19:19.432 --> 19:21.280
And then, once in a while,

19:21.281 --> 19:22.410
brings you to tears.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.190
For collectors, I'm sure it is.

19:24.191 --> 19:25.967
But for doctors, that's actually

19:25.968 --> 19:28.024
the definition of another term.

19:29.058 --> 19:30.130
And what's that?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.659
Stendhal syndrome.

19:32.985 --> 19:35.058
It's a psychosomatic illness that can cause

19:35.059 --> 19:37.788
dizziness, hallucinations,
and even fainting when,

19:37.789 --> 19:38.712
believe it or not,

19:38.713 --> 19:39.908
someone's overwhelmed

19:39.909 --> 19:41.774
by the beauty of a piece of art.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.971
- All right.
- Look, it's a theory.

19:44.972 --> 19:47.687
The mind can play very
powerful tricks with the body.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.665
And I've heard stories

19:48.666 --> 19:50.098
about some of these people.

19:50.107 --> 19:52.890
Tourists visiting the
louvre for the first time.

19:53.221 --> 19:55.717
But there's a difference
between being overwhelmed

19:56.490 --> 19:58.057
and being moved.

19:59.651 --> 20:01.320
Well, that's my theory.

20:01.321 --> 20:02.400
Okay.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.972
Why don't you come back after the party...

20:04.973 --> 20:06.294
So we can test it.

20:06.483 --> 20:07.972
Sure. Great.

20:07.973 --> 20:08.590
Thank you, doctor.

20:08.591 --> 20:10.032
Okay, see you later.

20:34.202 --> 20:35.742
Is everything okay?

20:35.743 --> 20:37.841
Not remotely.
Where did you go?

20:37.842 --> 20:39.697
I was right down...

20:40.394 --> 20:41.970
I was right down the street.

20:42.376 --> 20:43.852
I do have other patients right now.

20:43.853 --> 20:46.748
Not today.
Not according to this.

20:46.749 --> 20:47.767
What's that?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.226
Hank med's promise to stay at my side

20:49.227 --> 20:51.995
throughout my hospitalization.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.558
Hank promised this to you?

20:53.559 --> 20:54.342
No, Edwin did.

20:54.343 --> 20:56.083
And charged me
quite a premium for it.

20:56.084 --> 20:57.278
I'm so sorry, Edwin?

20:57.279 --> 20:58.576
The business guy.

20:58.577 --> 21:00.308
Lots of nervous energy.

21:00.309 --> 21:01.335
Yes, Evan.

21:01.336 --> 21:03.215
Yes, him.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.421
You know, should we just call Hank

21:06.422 --> 21:08.144
to straighten all of this out?

21:08.741 --> 21:09.709
That won't be necessary.

21:09.710 --> 21:11.165
I have got you covered.

21:11.598 --> 21:13.238
Whatever you need right now.

21:13.377 --> 21:14.399
Thank you.

21:18.157 --> 21:19.503
So what do you need right now.

21:19.504 --> 21:21.169
I'm glad you asked.

21:22.170 --> 21:23.395
Here's a list.

21:27.844 --> 21:29.428
All right, babe, you're up.

21:36.905 --> 21:38.997
Park place. I own park place!

21:38.998 --> 21:40.030
You owe me rent.

21:40.031 --> 21:41.124
Actually, uh,

21:41.125 --> 21:43.020
you had to mortgage that property,
my dear,

21:43.021 --> 21:44.872
which is what happens when
you make vanity investments.

21:44.873 --> 21:46.033
But here's what I'm gonna do.

21:46.034 --> 21:49.116
I will buy park place from you for $300

21:49.117 --> 21:50.083
and lift the mortgage.

21:50.084 --> 21:51.394
Everyone goes home a winner.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.432
My offer expires in 15 seconds.

21:54.473 --> 21:56.233
Looks like you need the cash.

21:58.267 --> 21:59.298
Hey.

22:00.772 --> 22:01.924
Hey.

22:02.379 --> 22:03.525
Hey, Paige.

22:03.526 --> 22:04.809
- Mrs. Collins.
- Hello.

22:04.810 --> 22:06.372
Hank, what are you doing here?

22:06.373 --> 22:07.709
I asked him to come.

22:07.763 --> 22:10.092
He met with a doctor who,
uh, brought up

22:10.093 --> 22:11.509
a new treatment option.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.045
Is your husband around

22:13.046 --> 22:14.893
to be part of the discussion, Mrs. Collins?

22:14.894 --> 22:16.263
He's not home.

22:16.264 --> 22:18.120
He wouldn't want to be part of it anyway.

22:18.121 --> 22:20.617
He thinks everything's fine, as is.

22:20.618 --> 22:21.777
- Yeah.
- Oh.

22:22.222 --> 22:24.453
So, uh, what did your doctor friend say?

22:27.187 --> 22:29.460
Well...obviously,

22:29.461 --> 22:31.576
she'd like to meet you in person, Mrs.
Collins,

22:31.577 --> 22:34.114
but thinks you may be a
candidate for E.C.T.

22:34.445 --> 22:37.093
I has the highest success rate
of any treatment she uses.

22:37.094 --> 22:37.664
E.C.T.?

22:37.665 --> 22:39.477
We talked about E.C.T. years ago.

22:39.478 --> 22:40.748
What... what is E.C.T.?

22:40.749 --> 22:42.870
I'm sorry, Hank, E.C.T.'s not for us.

22:42.871 --> 22:44.922
Hello, I'm not here just to grill chicken

22:44.923 --> 22:46.114
and build housing empires.

22:46.115 --> 22:46.698
What...

22:46.699 --> 22:49.533
Evan, E.C.T. is shock therapy.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.053
You came here to pitch us shock therapy?

22:54.370 --> 22:56.356
Electroconvulsive therapy

22:56.357 --> 22:58.764
- has changed a lot recently.
- Changed how?

22:58.765 --> 23:00.976
Well, for starters, it's now painless.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.970
Mrs. Collins,
you'd be anesthetized

23:03.971 --> 23:05.487
and monitored throughout the procedure

23:05.488 --> 23:07.218
by an expert staff.

23:17.703 --> 23:19.563
Hank would not endorse this

23:19.564 --> 23:21.228
if it wasn't a good idea.

23:24.077 --> 23:25.248
You don't have to decide right now.

23:25.249 --> 23:27.283
Just give it some thought.

23:27.284 --> 23:28.871
If you want to meet Dr. Burton tomorrow,

23:28.872 --> 23:30.807
I'll take you to Brooklyn myself.

23:47.255 --> 23:48.888
Look, even if it is Stendhal,

23:48.889 --> 23:50.650
there are treatment
options to help you cope.

23:50.651 --> 23:52.814
I need help coping with
this lighting system.

23:52.815 --> 23:53.870
On.

23:54.335 --> 23:56.440
It cost me almost as
much as the painting.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.181
Why do you need it?

23:58.182 --> 23:58.920
Well, it's harmless,

23:58.921 --> 24:00.314
unlike UV and infrared,

24:00.315 --> 24:03.523
and the curtain is for dust and debris.

24:03.868 --> 24:06.972
Paintings are as fragile as humans, doc.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.313
And, uh, harder to repair.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.114
I'm glad I chose the right calling.

24:11.645 --> 24:13.676
Yeah. Let me get the curtain.

24:13.690 --> 24:14.696
Eric, your back.

24:14.697 --> 24:15.985
Let me help you.

24:18.091 --> 24:19.716
Okay, easy.

24:20.269 --> 24:21.422
There you go.

24:22.147 --> 24:23.829
It's happening again, doc.

24:49.373 --> 24:50.730
So it's not the painting,

24:50.731 --> 24:52.659
it's the lighting that's
causing the seizures?

24:52.660 --> 24:54.348
I think
it's a photosensitive reaction

24:54.349 --> 24:56.234
called reflex epilepsy.

24:56.235 --> 24:57.188
Well, the lighting, it didn't come

24:57.189 --> 24:58.759
with that warning on the label.

24:59.108 --> 25:00.796
It's probably an imperceptible flicker

25:00.797 --> 25:02.400
from a defective bulb.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.375
Okay, Eric, this is Dr. Froash.

25:04.376 --> 25:06.438
She specializes in atypical seizures.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.727
She's gonna interpret the
results in real time.

25:08.766 --> 25:10.607
Okay, you can lie back now.

25:10.608 --> 25:12.440
I'm gonna put this cap on your head.

25:14.989 --> 25:16.316
Perfect.

25:22.675 --> 25:24.620
Okay, good to go, Wendy?

25:25.160 --> 25:26.216
Great.

25:30.330 --> 25:31.598
Okay, Eric...

25:31.599 --> 25:34.029
I'm gonna turn your picture
lights back on now.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.078
Lights on.

25:40.463 --> 25:43.019
Eric, are you seeing auras?

25:43.020 --> 25:44.420
Yeah, big time.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.512
Wendy.

25:45.513 --> 25:47.964
Bilateral, high-amplitude,
periodic spikes.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.625
Brain wave pattern shows
pre-seizure activity.

25:50.626 --> 25:53.209
- Okay.
- Lights off.

25:54.949 --> 25:56.469
Wave complexes are dropping.

25:56.470 --> 25:58.245
Eric, tell me what's happening.

25:58.748 --> 26:00.139
It's slowing down.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.684
And, uh...

26:03.374 --> 26:04.996
It's...

26:04.997 --> 26:06.252
Over.

26:07.387 --> 26:08.740
Thank you, Wendy.

26:08.896 --> 26:09.983
My pleasure, Hank.

26:09.984 --> 26:11.928
Best of luck to Mr. Kassabian.

26:16.786 --> 26:19.634
Okay, so I'm allergic to high-end lighting?

26:19.702 --> 26:21.720
I'm guessing
it's just strobe lighting

26:21.721 --> 26:23.051
your brain doesn't like.

26:23.052 --> 26:24.625
- What now?
- Two options:

26:24.626 --> 26:27.348
You can go on an anti-seizure
medicine called depakote.

26:27.349 --> 26:28.022
Or...

26:28.023 --> 26:28.923
You can change the bulb.

26:28.924 --> 26:30.102
Okay.

26:30.103 --> 26:31.057
Well, no offense, doc,

26:31.058 --> 26:33.609
but I'd rather deal with an
electrician than a doctor.

26:33.610 --> 26:35.662
Unfortunately, we still
have to deal with your...

26:35.663 --> 26:37.653
Oh, that ridiculous...

26:37.654 --> 26:40.014
Yeah, let's just call it a pinched nerve.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.666
I'm scheduling you
for a steroid injection

26:41.667 --> 26:43.134
at the hospital tomorrow.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.205
I'd do it myself, but a
direct spinal injection

26:45.206 --> 26:47.289
requires hospital precautions.

26:47.435 --> 26:49.155
The good news is...

26:51.822 --> 26:55.110
Isabella didn't cause any of this.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.588
That's a lot of tongue depressors.

27:47.589 --> 27:49.418
Enough to do the trick, presumably.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.899
You think he's good to go?

27:51.028 --> 27:52.413
Mm, let's find out.

27:52.509 --> 27:53.732
Okay.

27:54.254 --> 27:56.730
Riley, I am gonna rest my thumbs

27:56.731 --> 27:58.537
on your lower molars.

27:58.538 --> 28:00.006
And curve my other fingers

28:00.007 --> 28:01.895
around the outside of your jawbone.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.570
Now I'm gonna push down...

28:06.571 --> 28:08.256
And backward

28:08.379 --> 28:12.814
back into the mandibular fossa.

28:12.815 --> 28:14.840
Hey, Dr. Van Dyke,
be careful not to...

28:15.502 --> 28:17.024
Cover his ears, quickly.

28:17.206 --> 28:20.078
Ohh, son of a bitch!

28:21.109 --> 28:23.420
Dude, I heard that.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.514
Ah, Riley, you just regained
the ability to speak.

28:26.515 --> 28:28.135
That's the first thing you wanna say?

28:28.136 --> 28:29.512
No, it's not.

28:30.830 --> 28:32.366
Thank you, Divya.

28:44.588 --> 28:45.611
Hey.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.291
How's Ellen?

28:51.290 --> 28:53.106
She's willing to see the doctor

28:53.130 --> 28:54.880
and hear about the E.C.T. thing.

28:54.881 --> 28:55.742
Paige convinced her.

28:55.743 --> 28:57.632
That's really good news,
Evan, for everyone.

28:57.633 --> 28:59.833
Yep, Paige said she trusts me

28:59.834 --> 29:01.466
and that I trust you.

29:02.273 --> 29:04.201
Apparently,
that was good enough for Ellen.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.857
Okay.

29:06.033 --> 29:07.233
What does the general think?

29:07.234 --> 29:08.923
Paige was afraid to find out.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.796
So...We're not looping him in just yet.

29:12.364 --> 29:13.581
Okay, I'll take Ellen and Paige

29:13.582 --> 29:15.295
to see Dr. Burton, and she'll explain

29:15.296 --> 29:16.856
the whole procedure to them.

29:17.566 --> 29:18.566
Cool.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.665
But Mr. Kassabian is diabetic, so...

29:26.666 --> 29:28.757
No oral or IV steroids.
Yeah, yeah.

29:28.758 --> 29:30.588
Direct nerve injection only.

29:30.589 --> 29:33.325
Dr. Lawson,
despite my boyish good looks,

29:33.326 --> 29:34.917
this isn't my first day playing doctor.

29:34.918 --> 29:35.612
It isn't mine, either,

29:35.613 --> 29:37.501
which is why I double check
the important stuff.

29:37.502 --> 29:38.627
We will send him back to you

29:38.628 --> 29:40.276
just the way we found him.

29:40.334 --> 29:41.526
I promise.

29:56.951 --> 29:58.943
I see that you have
everything that you need.

30:01.395 --> 30:03.283
I have everything I've asked for.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.928
It is normal to feel
afraid before surgery.

30:07.899 --> 30:09.316
But it'll go fine.

30:09.558 --> 30:10.951
I'm sure it will.

30:11.488 --> 30:13.344
It's what happens next

30:13.432 --> 30:14.888
that scares me.

30:15.836 --> 30:16.909
What do you mean?

30:17.042 --> 30:18.185
Well...

30:18.757 --> 30:20.017
What if I'm healthy,

30:20.018 --> 30:22.051
and I still can't get hired here?

30:23.177 --> 30:27.193
And I can't blame my throat,
only my voice.

30:30.848 --> 30:31.747
Okay, to be honest,

30:31.748 --> 30:33.907
I'm not familiar with your work.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.697
But I'm sure that you are
very good at what you do.

30:37.032 --> 30:40.925
And I am sure that there are plenty
of people here waiting to notice.

30:56.581 --> 30:57.677
General, sir.

30:58.549 --> 31:00.625
I still cannot believe they
gave you the intrepid.

31:00.626 --> 31:04.567
You must have many, many
kills to your name.

31:04.568 --> 31:05.845
Where's Paige?

31:05.846 --> 31:07.788
She is running a little late.

31:08.071 --> 31:10.898
Did she clearly explain your role?

31:10.899 --> 31:11.744
She did, sir.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.205
And I am, uh, more than ready

31:13.206 --> 31:15.814
to meet, greet, and pass along, sir.

31:18.678 --> 31:20.068
Yes, sir. Good.

31:20.407 --> 31:21.512
Very good.

31:21.816 --> 31:23.273
All right, so...

31:24.154 --> 31:25.782
Are you ready to meet the general?

31:25.783 --> 31:26.786
- Yes!
- Oh, come on.

31:26.787 --> 31:28.244
Are you ready to meet the general?

31:28.245 --> 31:29.865
- Yeah!
- Let's this.

31:29.866 --> 31:31.851
Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to meet

31:31.852 --> 31:33.616
our future senator.

31:33.617 --> 31:34.989
Hi, what's your name?

31:34.990 --> 31:37.381
Maggie, very good.
Come over here, Maggie.

31:37.491 --> 31:39.565
This is Jim.
Two tours in Iraq.

31:39.758 --> 31:41.240
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Evan.

31:41.241 --> 31:43.509
This is Teresa.
Just got back from Afghanistan.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.110
Teresa, how are you?

31:45.138 --> 31:46.215
This is Oliver.

31:46.216 --> 31:47.653
Bronze star awarded.

31:47.654 --> 31:49.701
- I'm pleased to meet you, sir.
- I'm so proud of you.

31:50.444 --> 31:52.984
Can you give me the name
of the gym you work out in?

31:52.985 --> 31:55.146
- What branch of service?
- Okay, never mind.

31:56.699 --> 31:59.020
Water? Water, guys?
Anyone want a water?

32:08.055 --> 32:09.790
Hi. How are you?

32:16.632 --> 32:17.779
Thank you, sir.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.020
I'm parched.

32:25.706 --> 32:27.140
God, I thought that was water.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.897
Well, scotch has some water.

32:29.898 --> 32:31.553
You trying to kill me, sir?

32:32.177 --> 32:33.048
Again?

32:33.049 --> 32:34.219
No.

32:34.311 --> 32:35.759
I'm trying to thank you.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.092
This was a big success.

32:38.093 --> 32:41.254
And you were surprisingly competent.

32:42.474 --> 32:43.811
Thank you, sir.

32:46.652 --> 32:48.286
What's he doing here?

32:53.250 --> 32:54.641
With my daughter.

33:00.513 --> 33:02.996
I don't recall my staff
sending you an invite,

33:02.997 --> 33:04.244
Dr. Lawson.

33:04.422 --> 33:05.791
He drove us in.

33:06.261 --> 33:07.341
Me and mom.

33:08.432 --> 33:11.058
Your wife is at Brooklyn
heights mercy hospital.

33:11.308 --> 33:13.299
Getting prepped for E.C.T.

33:14.321 --> 33:15.956
And now he's been looped in.

33:15.957 --> 33:18.551
She doesn't need that treatment.

33:18.552 --> 33:20.826
Sir...she does.

33:20.827 --> 33:22.099
You don't even know her!

33:22.100 --> 33:23.141
Daddy...

33:24.069 --> 33:25.893
I have spent too long

33:25.976 --> 33:28.156
standing in for her at photo ops...

33:28.157 --> 33:30.847
And dinners and book signings.

33:31.199 --> 33:33.967
Too long protecting you
from the truth.

33:34.356 --> 33:36.724
Now it's time to protect mom!

33:39.049 --> 33:41.096
Let Hank do that.

33:46.172 --> 33:47.461
Katdare, you're off the clock?

33:47.462 --> 33:49.231
I'm between patients
at the moment.

33:49.232 --> 33:51.217
Great, radiculopathy, room four.

34:00.646 --> 34:03.662
Mr. Kassabian, I have your
steroid treatment here.

34:03.663 --> 34:04.942
Right, thanks.

34:09.429 --> 34:10.703
Have we met before?

34:11.199 --> 34:12.496
I don't believe so.

34:14.146 --> 34:15.699
Radiculopathy, huh?

34:15.853 --> 34:18.106
That can be...
quite painful.

34:18.107 --> 34:19.178
Yeah, and you guys need to come up

34:19.179 --> 34:21.109
with a more painful-sounding name for it.

34:21.110 --> 34:22.926
I'll mention that at the next meeting.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.061
You sure we haven't met?

34:29.443 --> 34:30.739
Have you been here before?

34:30.739 --> 34:31.737
Mm, no.

34:31.739 --> 34:33.042
Then I'm pretty certain.

34:33.518 --> 34:35.717
Oh, and, uh, I'll get you a prescription

34:35.719 --> 34:37.511
for some oral steroids as well.

34:37.512 --> 34:38.730
Thanks.

34:53.042 --> 34:55.253
I'll admit she's had her bad days.

34:55.254 --> 34:56.799
I know how hard it is to face the truth,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.249
but we're dealing with
more than bad days here.

35:00.387 --> 35:02.935
This is long-term clinical depression.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.064
It's real, it's severe,

35:05.065 --> 35:06.751
and it requires medical attention.

35:06.752 --> 35:08.381
Listen here, young man.

35:08.382 --> 35:11.143
I don't need to be lectured
about what's real.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.747
I'm trying to protect the woman I love

35:13.748 --> 35:15.875
from yet another disappointment.

35:15.876 --> 35:19.201
Because every one is worse
than the one before it.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.013
For all of us.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.133
And there are no guarantees.

35:29.354 --> 35:30.771
But, in my opinion,

35:30.847 --> 35:32.520
this is worth a shot.

35:33.511 --> 35:35.846
If she has family support.

35:36.894 --> 35:38.180
You being at her side
may be the difference

35:38.181 --> 35:39.639
between this treatment succeeding

35:39.640 --> 35:43.617
and it being...
just one more good try.

35:44.714 --> 35:46.505
I just wish your family

35:46.506 --> 35:49.106
would stay out of my family's life.

35:49.513 --> 35:50.640
Sir...

35:55.981 --> 35:58.988
Sorbets, smoothies, and lots of fage.

35:58.989 --> 36:00.770
I'll alert the staff right now.

36:00.771 --> 36:01.843
Thank you.

36:02.050 --> 36:04.246
And fage total 0%.

36:04.247 --> 36:05.992
Of course, of course.

36:06.759 --> 36:10.663
And here is something else
to help you through this.

36:11.034 --> 36:12.165
Your iPod?

36:12.166 --> 36:13.335
My iPod.

36:14.512 --> 36:15.951
Your music.

36:16.388 --> 36:17.816
You downloaded one of my songs?

36:17.817 --> 36:19.517
I downloaded all of them.

36:19.518 --> 36:21.727
And I liked every, single one.

36:22.124 --> 36:24.982
Now that I am familiar with your work,

36:24.983 --> 36:26.663
I know that you're good
at what you do.

36:27.243 --> 36:28.865
You're gonna do great, Raina.

36:28.871 --> 36:30.544
In here and out there.

36:30.658 --> 36:33.269
I'm sorry if I was a
little high maintenance.

36:33.270 --> 36:35.401
You? Please.

36:36.691 --> 36:39.004
I'm not your biggest headache?

36:40.181 --> 36:41.830
You don't even know the half of it.

36:50.659 --> 36:52.844
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey!

36:52.898 --> 36:54.119
Need some coffee?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.165
No, just sleep.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.740
But I'm almost there.

36:57.741 --> 36:59.447
Thanks again for taking the shift.

36:59.448 --> 37:01.721
Oh, of course.
How was the city?

37:02.094 --> 37:04.038
Well, the candidate's perfect.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.733
And he can start any time.

37:05.734 --> 37:07.158
Well, that's great.

37:07.423 --> 37:09.393
You'll be back in Uruguay
before you know it.

37:09.825 --> 37:10.872
Yeah.

37:12.448 --> 37:13.651
Wasn't that what you wanted?

37:13.652 --> 37:15.388
It is, it's just...

37:15.889 --> 37:17.056
Real now.

37:22.612 --> 37:24.412
Hey, Ellen...

37:24.552 --> 37:26.944
I'd like to start counting
backwards from ten.

37:27.074 --> 37:28.082
Okay.

37:30.824 --> 37:31.889
Ten.

37:31.890 --> 37:33.155
Nine.

37:36.662 --> 37:37.927
It's gonna be okay.

38:05.179 --> 38:07.213
They're giving your mom
succinylcholine.

38:07.214 --> 38:10.843
It's a paralytic agent used
to induce muscle relaxation.

38:18.896 --> 38:22.947
Dr. Burton is applying conducting
gel to the electrodes.

38:25.122 --> 38:28.446
Now she's attaching the
electrodes to her temples.

38:32.035 --> 38:33.179
Okay.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.814
Now they're gonna use that black box

38:35.815 --> 38:38.608
to pass electric currents
through your mom's brain.

38:40.555 --> 38:42.123
It should induce a controlled seizure,

38:42.124 --> 38:43.671
which alters her chemistry

38:43.672 --> 38:46.614
and hopefully resolves her symptoms.

38:50.918 --> 38:52.005
Here we go.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.340
Okay. Okay.

39:20.341 --> 39:21.829
She took well to it.

39:21.850 --> 39:23.142
- Ohh.
- That's good sign.

39:23.484 --> 39:24.851
You're right, Hank.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.888
E.C.D. is not what it used to be.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.633
Hey.

39:58.830 --> 39:59.918
Hey.

40:04.751 --> 40:06.217
So I'm sorry about your windshield.

40:06.218 --> 40:08.052
I'm not worried about the windshield.

40:09.012 --> 40:11.188
Well, you don't have to
worry about us, either.

40:11.210 --> 40:12.467
I don't.

40:16.555 --> 40:19.132
Thank you for helping Paige's mom.

40:22.055 --> 40:24.677
Evan... we did it together.

40:24.704 --> 40:27.217
I was pretty instrumental.
You're right.

40:27.945 --> 40:30.491
I'm glad Hank med is back
at full force.

40:30.492 --> 40:32.754
Well, 2/3 of our full force
is standing right here.

40:32.755 --> 40:33.668
Who's minding the store?

40:33.669 --> 40:35.999
Don't worry, Divya's keeping
an eye on the Hamptons.

40:36.000 --> 40:36.823
All right, why don't you go

40:36.824 --> 40:38.799
get her excited about my return.

40:39.504 --> 40:40.759
I want it.

41:15.378 --> 41:16.609
Eric?

41:24.848 --> 41:26.145
Eric?

41:35.906 --> 41:36.946
Eric!

41:42.004 --> 41:43.576
Eric, can you hear me?

41:43.577 --> 41:44.642
Eric!

41:57.635 --> 41:59.446
Yeah, this is Dr. Lawson.

41:59.447 --> 42:01.935
I'm at 1 cayne court
with a 35-year-old male

42:01.936 --> 42:04.789
in acute diabetic ketoacidosis.

42:04.790 --> 42:08.806
He was mistakenly
given oral steroids.

42:10.035 --> 42:10.948
He's tachycardic and unresponsive.

42:10.949 --> 42:14.281
<i>I'm intubating, giving 500ccs of saline</i>

42:14.282 --> 42:16.113
<i>and checking his glucose level.</i>
