00:26.983 --> 00:29.333
"And ere he blew three notes,"

00:31.248 --> 00:35.600
such sweet soft notes as yet a musician's
cunning never gave the enraptured air.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.302
There was a rustling that
seemed like a bustling,

00:42.651 --> 00:46.370
of merry crowds jostling
and pitching and hustling.

00:46.394 --> 00:50.659
Small feet were pattering,
wooden shoes clattering.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.073
Little hands clapping

00:54.097 --> 00:56.491
"and little tongues chattering."

00:57.274 --> 00:59.668
That's enough, Daddy.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.864
Is it scaring you?

01:02.888 --> 01:04.691
No, it's just,

01:04.715 --> 01:06.109
I know the ending.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.444
Let me close that for you.
All right?

01:17.468 --> 01:19.601
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.691
It's just a nice old tree.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.454
Good-bye, Daddy.

01:27.478 --> 01:30.718
I think you mean "good
night," sweetheart.

01:30.742 --> 01:34.616
You only say good-bye when you're
going away for a long time.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.620
Oh, yeah. I forgot. Good night.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.666
Good night, love.
Get some sleep.

01:53.591 --> 01:57.832
Sometimes I wish we could just
freeze her in time. You know?

01:57.856 --> 02:00.816
Keep her our little kid forever.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.428
Selfish, I know.Mmm.

02:05.429 --> 02:08.104
All parents feel
that way, I think.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.020
Sometimes I just wanna grab
her by the shoulders and say,

02:12.044 --> 02:14.458
"I love you. Stop growing up."

02:14.482 --> 02:16.484
I hear you.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.929
Did you hear that?

03:14.411 --> 03:15.630
Emma?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.372
Emma?

03:21.070 --> 03:22.637
Emma!

03:25.466 --> 03:27.487
Emma!

03:27.511 --> 03:29.034
Call the police.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.473
WhJust call the police!

03:36.041 --> 03:37.478
Daddy!

03:38.479 --> 03:40.979
- Daddy!

03:41.003 --> 03:42.937
Emma?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.461
David, where is she?
I don't know.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.748
- Emma!
- Emma!

03:49.054 --> 03:51.535
- Daddy!
- Emma!

03:53.407 --> 03:54.819
Emma!

03:54.843 --> 03:57.976
Daddy!

05:24.889 --> 05:26.214
This is insane.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.999
Uh-huh.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.416
He's not a threat.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.269
He is nine years old.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.923
And how old are you?

05:38.947 --> 05:41.360
What does that have
to do with anything?

05:41.384 --> 05:44.624
Maybe he's not the threat
Officer Frank is worried about.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.583
Ever think of that?

05:46.607 --> 05:50.500
What did you want me to do?
Just let them bully him?

05:50.524 --> 05:52.937
Your mom's gonna be here soon.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.223
Shouldn't be long.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.801
They don't pay me
enough for this crap.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.096
You going somewhere?

07:05.120 --> 07:07.664
We were coming out
to meet you.Uh-huh.

07:07.688 --> 07:11.015
Okay, in the car. Let's go.
Michael. Come on.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.693
Come on, bud.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.135
Put your feet in. Feet in.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.141
Too fast.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.687
Hey, Doris. I'm so sorry.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.017
You have my sympathies.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.955
Anna, hey.Hi.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.697
- Officer Frank.
- Oh. Hey.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.263
Hey, Noa.Hi.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.397
Hey, I just need to talk
to your mom for a minute.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.292
Okay.Okay.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.460
I mean, he's an imaginative kid.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.723
You know Michael.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.552
I mean, it's been a while.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.423
Well, I mean, I've
been working a lot.

08:11.447 --> 08:15.471
It's not like I have free
time, like, to do things.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.429
Is this really necessary?

08:17.453 --> 08:20.911
Well, he... he told the principal
he heard naughty voices

08:20.935 --> 08:23.130
telling him to do very,
very bad things.

08:23.154 --> 08:26.786
So what does that mean?
I don't know.

08:26.810 --> 08:30.529
But, you know, in today's
world, with the schools,

08:30.553 --> 08:32.575
we can't take any
chances, you know.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.881
He's a little kid! I know.

08:34.905 --> 08:38.866
But it's a thin line between
imaginative and troubled.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.975
Oh, now he's "troubled"?

08:41.999 --> 08:44.717
This is... I... I don't know. I don't...
No, I don't think so.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.024
No. He's... He's just...
I think that...

08:47.048 --> 08:49.659
I think he's just a
lonely kid, that's all.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.726
I don't know what
to do about that.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.468
I have to work. A lot.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.644
So that we can live.

08:58.668 --> 09:02.759
Well, I mean, if you didn't delete
my number, you know, it's 911.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.967
You gotta tell me
something, buddy.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.297
What's going on at school?
What's happening?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.581
I need you to tell me something.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.825
Jesus, Noa!

09:27.479 --> 09:29.394
I have a paper to do.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.658
Okay.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.834
Seat belt.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.041
Jesus! Oh. Sorry.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.826
I didn't mean to.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.742
Yeah. I didn't... I'm sorry.
Uh, I just.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.134
Hi.Hi.

09:54.158 --> 09:58.051
I wanted to say, just before
you left, if you, uh...

09:58.075 --> 09:59.858
If you need me to come
by, make dinner, check

09:59.870 --> 10:01.664
on 'em, or check on
you, or, you know...

10:01.688 --> 10:04.604
If I'm not working, or even if
I'm working, I could... Okay.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.976
Oh, my God. Now
they're flirting.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.283
Stop it. You stop.

10:12.307 --> 10:16.200
Stop being so weird. Look what you
do with your freaking weirdness.

10:16.224 --> 10:19.072
I can't deal with a mom
relationship right now.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.335
She doesn't have time to date.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.861
Is this your way of worming
your way back into my life?

10:24.885 --> 10:26.800
Well, I take issue with "worm."

10:29.629 --> 10:31.694
Okay!

10:31.718 --> 10:33.696
Okay. Thank you. All right.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.349
Anytime.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.308
Be good to your mom.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.899
Seat belt.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.602
Shouldn't we have
a family meeting?

11:10.626 --> 11:12.082
Take a vote?

11:12.106 --> 11:14.258
Let's not rush into this.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.303
Baby, we're not rushing
into anything.

11:16.327 --> 11:19.829
We're gonna interview each
candidate really carefully. Okay?

11:19.853 --> 11:22.701
I've outgrown the nanny era.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.747
I can take care of Michael.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.706
Haven't I done good,
not counting today?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.384
Yes. But then...

11:30.472 --> 11:32.319
And I'm not blaming you...

11:32.343 --> 11:35.496
I get a call from the school,
who's called in Frank

11:35.520 --> 11:38.761
because they're concerned
about a potential

11:38.785 --> 11:40.458
school shooting
kind of situation.

11:40.482 --> 11:43.461
I'm not blaming you, but I'm blaming you.
I'm... No.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.942
Honey.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.968
He screwed up. The
system screwed up.

11:49.665 --> 11:53.514
But somehow I'm not the
one who's good enough?

11:53.538 --> 11:56.498
No. I'm sorry. You're right.

11:58.979 --> 12:02.591
But obviously something
isn't working.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.313
I'm thinking, you know,
three nights a week,

12:09.337 --> 12:10.967
at the most.

12:10.991 --> 12:14.168
And the person will be
really focused on Michael.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.040
'Cause he needs attention.

12:18.738 --> 12:23.327
Baby, I know that you've been really
looking out for your brother.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.048
And I love that.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.245
I really do.

12:28.269 --> 12:31.378
But when was the last time you
hung out with your friends?

12:31.402 --> 12:32.858
Like Kyra.

12:32.882 --> 12:35.078
And that cute boy, Matt.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.887
I'm not friends with them anymore.
What?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.632
People change, I guess.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.853
Baby, you're so dirty.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.334
But you're cute.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.230
Michael.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.362
Michael!

13:20.756 --> 13:22.386
What are you doing?

13:22.410 --> 13:23.890
Nothing.

13:25.152 --> 13:28.435
- Stop being so weird.
- You're weirder than me.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.351
At least I'm not the reason Mom's
trying to hire a new nanny right now.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.964
- No. There will
be no new nanny.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.357
It's humiliating.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.706
You owe me.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.317
Mom said we all gotta agree.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.581
You vote how I tell you. Okay?

13:43.605 --> 13:47.411
Look, if I cough after an
interview, like this...

13:47.435 --> 13:49.935
It means no way, thumbs down.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.198
Vote "no" even if I vote "yes."

13:52.222 --> 13:54.268
And if I rub my
eyebrow, like this,

13:55.486 --> 13:57.334
it means say "yes"
and I'll say "no."

13:57.358 --> 14:00.337
We gotta mix it up so she doesn't
know we're up to something.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.426
What if there's
someone really great?

14:02.450 --> 14:04.408
In this town?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.052
Remember who was there trying
to break you out of there

14:08.076 --> 14:09.825
before Mom even got
around to showing up?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.460
Me! I know what I'm doing.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.312
Now repeat after me.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.185
The only good nanny is no nanny.

14:22.209 --> 14:25.125
The only good nanny is no nanny.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.185
What am I gonna do
with you, kiddo?

15:49.209 --> 15:51.709
All right, it's bedtime.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.561
Come on. Careful.

16:09.577 --> 16:13.513
I have games, if you guys like games.
I love playing games.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.342
I also love to bake, so
if your children are...

16:16.366 --> 16:18.866
I have a lot of experience
as a substitute teacher.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.589
- I love helping kids
with their homework.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.050
Oh, of course, I
can make a lunch.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.140
Put some mayo on there, put some,
uh, you know, ham and cheese.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.532
It's one of my favorites.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.882
I'm not a fan.

16:34.906 --> 16:38.364
- I mean, she was okay, but...
- I thought you liked her.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.781
Okay.

16:45.783 --> 16:47.983
Even if it's sort of last
minute, that's definitely fine.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.638
I'm more than happy to help your children
with their homework. Absolutely.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.534
And I would probably...

16:54.230 --> 16:55.991
Okay, so she's a maybe.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.625
Not her.

17:14.381 --> 17:18.602
Thank you so much. Have a good one.
- You too.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.020
Nah, I don't think so.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.979
I thought she was so great.

17:28.002 --> 17:29.981
Yeah. What the heck?
I loved her.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.505
God, are my standards
just too low?

17:32.529 --> 17:34.551
We still have a
couple more people.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.553
I bet one of them
will be the one.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.946
Don't give up yet, Mom.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.774
Maybe we should just make do.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.299
Maybe Frank can bring us
pizza Thursday night.

17:43.323 --> 17:46.128
No. You said it.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.130
We can't just give up.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.634
Mmm.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.334
Oh, guys, I have
to go in to work.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.489
Am I just a horrible mother?

17:59.513 --> 18:02.405
I mean, I was gonna leave
you with those people.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.060
I thought they were all fine.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.887
But maybe I'm just the worst.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.368
- No!
- What Michael means...

18:09.392 --> 18:12.241
Noa made sure we said no to everybody.
She made me!

18:12.265 --> 18:14.112
She had signals!

18:14.136 --> 18:16.530
Shut up.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.621
Noa, is that true?

18:21.578 --> 18:24.122
We don't need a nanny anyway.

18:24.146 --> 18:27.952
It's a waste. Like, I'm literally
saving this family money.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.370
How could you do that, Noa?

18:39.683 --> 18:43.252
Do you have any idea
how badly I need help?

18:44.514 --> 18:46.299
Huh.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.149
- Noa, upstairs.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.673
- She probably has a butcher knife!
- Upstairs now. Let's go.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.110
Come on. You too, Michael.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.589
But why? Up. Up.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.485
She made me. Up, up, up.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.076
Hi.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.209
Leonor from Spenser.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.558
I'm sorry?

19:08.582 --> 19:11.280
Leonor Cottingwood from the
Spenser Domestic Agency.

19:12.977 --> 19:15.676
I was sent in regards
to the nanny position.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.485
Did you walk here?

19:22.509 --> 19:24.835
Has it already been filled, Ms.
Montaner?

19:24.859 --> 19:27.577
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm a little confused.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.579
I... You weren't on my list.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.495
Did you reply to the ad or...

19:32.519 --> 19:34.671
Ms. Montaner, the Spenser Agency

19:34.695 --> 19:37.524
is the most prestigious nanny
placement service in the world.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.329
They've placed the
perfect nannies

19:40.353 --> 19:42.548
with the right families
for centuries.

19:42.572 --> 19:45.247
Should there be a situation
in which they can be of help,

19:45.271 --> 19:47.795
you can be certain
they will hear of it.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.015
Come on in.

19:56.630 --> 19:59.391
So it's... It's three
nights a week.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.873
The ideal is for our nannies to
live with their chosen families.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.222
Oh.

20:04.246 --> 20:07.815
It is the only way to truly
reach the little ones.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.820
It really would be ideal.

20:17.651 --> 20:18.913
Okay.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.748
I just wish I had time to
properly interview you.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.509
But I have to run off to work.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.642
But maybe you could
leave your number?

20:32.666 --> 20:35.253
Or I could start now and
save you the bother.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.169
I really have to run that
kind of thing by the kids.

20:38.193 --> 20:42.850
I have a feeling this may be
just what is needed by them,

20:43.851 --> 20:45.809
and by you.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.410
Okay.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.021
Yeah. Let's... We should...

21:04.045 --> 21:05.805
Let's give it a shot.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.068
But you have to meet
the kids first.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.094
I feel that we already have.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.882
Mom, can I talk
to you for a sec?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.777
Um, I don't think we
should hire this...

21:20.801 --> 21:23.475
We are just giving her a tryout.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.347
What is wrong with that?

21:25.371 --> 21:26.894
There's something.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.569
She just gives me a bad feeling.
Okay?

21:30.593 --> 21:35.381
Noa, I cannot handle double
shifts and Michael's stuff.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.600
I just can't.

21:38.732 --> 21:42.170
So just please
give her a chance.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.912
Please. For me.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.810
So, I should just
be a few hours.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.726
And if there's any
problem, just call me.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.101
There shall be no problems,
I assure you.Okay.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.039
Thank you so much.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.674
Okay.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.792
Are you not going
to eat, my dear?

22:40.228 --> 22:41.553
No.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.666
I'm good.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.633
Something is not quite right.
Is it now?

23:08.474 --> 23:13.150
Now... isn't that much
more comfortable?

23:13.174 --> 23:14.915
I guess so.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.961
Eat. It's good.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.096
Eat.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.186
It is good for you.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.852
Um...

23:42.421 --> 23:45.269
I... I-I just need some water.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.358
Of course. Allow me to...

23:47.382 --> 23:49.558
No. I can get it.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.323
Children,

23:56.347 --> 24:00.980
now that you're in my care I think
it time we set some ground rules.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.374
Firstly, could I ask
you both to be so good

24:03.398 --> 24:07.509
as not to leave your seats
without first being excused?

24:07.533 --> 24:12.015
Secondly, I shall ask you to kindly
not stay up past your bedtime.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.995
And third?

24:16.019 --> 24:18.892
And what, my dear, makes you
think there is a third?

24:19.719 --> 24:21.000
I don't know.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.287
Don't these things
usually come in threes?

24:27.378 --> 24:29.356
When is our bedtime?

24:29.380 --> 24:31.968
Whenever I say it is, my dear.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.734
What happens if we
stay up past bedtime?

24:38.041 --> 24:40.914
Do you really want to find out?

24:52.403 --> 24:53.927
Off to bed now.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.794
[pop music playing
on headphones]

25:48.938 --> 25:51.985
[thumping continues louder]

26:05.868 --> 26:08.828
[thumping, rattling continue]

26:13.659 --> 26:18.707
[rumbling, thumping continue]

27:00.706 --> 27:02.969
I-I heard noises.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.557
It is your imagination

27:06.581 --> 27:08.931
playing tricks on you, my dear.

27:16.722 --> 27:20.092
You children are far
too full of fancy.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.076
Need to keep your feet firmly
planted on the ground.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.926
Off to bed now.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.737
He locks his door at night.
You won't be able to...

27:33.216 --> 27:36.698
It would seem your brother is
a remarkably light sleeper.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.798
Cannot sleep either, my dear?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.606
Is it the thunder?

27:55.630 --> 27:58.894
Or are there other sounds that
have been plaguing your ears?

28:01.462 --> 28:03.377
Maybe.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.815
We all hear things.

28:08.164 --> 28:11.559
It's simply a question of
whether one chooses to listen.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.306
Something out here, perhaps?

28:20.394 --> 28:22.048
Voices?

28:23.876 --> 28:25.965
They're just in my head.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.141
No.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.274
They are quite real, my dear.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.981
Would you like it if I were
to tell you a bedtime story?

28:49.640 --> 28:53.185
Once upon a time there
was another world.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.797
It was very, very far away,

28:55.821 --> 28:57.997
and yet right beside this one.

28:59.694 --> 29:03.456
- It was a world of
magic and wonder, Anna.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.808
But also of war, villains, and horror.
Hi! How are you?

29:06.832 --> 29:11.314
It was not unlike this one in
that way, and in other ways too.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.493
In fact, they were those who found
themselves living in the wrong world

29:18.104 --> 29:20.193
and didn't even know it.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.973
[whispering continues, louder]

30:43.711 --> 30:47.628
Hi. Yeah, um, I was trying to
reach Officer Frank Gomez.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.433
Frank, you got a call

30:50.457 --> 30:53.088
for a disturbance over
at the Montaner place.

30:53.112 --> 30:56.419
Request that you go over there immediately.
Yeah, okay. I copy that.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.013
I got it!

31:31.150 --> 31:33.500
Officer Frank, come in.
Come in, come in.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.915
Is everything okay, Noa?
It's the new nanny.

31:37.939 --> 31:42.335
She locked Michael in his room and she
was on top of the roof, climbing around.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.705
Anna got a nanny?

31:45.729 --> 31:48.230
I mean, I could've just
watched you guys.Listen.

31:48.254 --> 31:52.756
She had some really
weird stuff in her bag.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.651
I mean, like, really strange.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.481
You were going
through her things?

31:59.613 --> 32:00.657
Come on. You'll see.

32:05.184 --> 32:08.535
This is our new nanny, Leonor.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.296
Hi. Nice to meet you.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.756
Frank.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.172
You'll have to excuse
this mess, Officer.

32:17.196 --> 32:19.198
Just whipping up a
late-night snack.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.787
This might not be to your taste.

32:23.811 --> 32:27.356
But perhaps I could warm you
up some leftovers from dinner?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.208
Sure.

32:30.818 --> 32:32.080
Don't eat it.

32:34.604 --> 32:37.216
A hardworking officer
needs his strength.

32:41.089 --> 32:44.005
Wow. It's really good.

32:51.665 --> 32:54.146
You're up past your
bedtime, my dear.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.963
Oh, man.

33:08.987 --> 33:13.706
Left my lights on again. Now, don't tell
the sheriff. He hates it when I do that.

33:13.730 --> 33:17.493
Honestly, though, that was the best
food I think I've ever had in my life.

33:17.517 --> 33:18.537
Thank you.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.583
Well, you drive safely then.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.151
All right. Okay. Yeah.

33:23.175 --> 33:26.265
Please, no!

34:07.349 --> 34:09.806
We should get a drink.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.286
Yeah, I wish.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.833
Come on. The new nanny's so great.
Right?

34:14.878 --> 34:16.594
It's not even late.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.771
Come on. It is her first night.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.121
No way. I cannot do that.
Yeah, you can.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.190
Anna.

34:34.855 --> 34:38.052
Maybe I can start to get some
of my life back, you know?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.686
That's the spirit.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.188
Yeah, maybe I'll, like,
start dating again.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.451
Frank was kinda sniffing around,

34:46.475 --> 34:49.217
but, I don't know, he's
such a teddy bear.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.065
Sometimes in a cute way.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.135
Sometimes in, like,
a no-genitals way.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.508
You must be giving out
pheromones already,

34:59.532 --> 35:03.207
'cause that kinda-scary,
kinda-hot, intense guy

35:03.231 --> 35:05.470
keeps checking you out.

35:05.494 --> 35:08.038
Just signal if he's weird.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.716
Wait.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.688
Hi. I'm David.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.407
Good morning, Ms. Montaner.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.670
Good morning.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.782
Hmm.

36:28.273 --> 36:31.774
Of course, I cook all three
meals every day, without fail.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.602
But should I ever be detained,

36:33.626 --> 36:37.282
there will always be a meal tailored
exactly to their individual needs.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.437
What is that?

36:42.461 --> 36:44.941
Some kind of kale or something?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.616
Only the best for my dearies.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.009
Nothing more nutritious.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.446
Yeah.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.883
Good luck getting
them to eat that.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.277
Fear not, my dear.
I have my ways.

36:56.301 --> 36:59.739
Well, it seems like you really
have it all figured out.

37:02.002 --> 37:05.310
Pretty soon you're not
even gonna need me.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.964
I find most children
just need a gentle push

37:31.988 --> 37:34.382
to help them see the magic
of the great outdoors.

37:38.952 --> 37:42.018
Hey. Wait. Noa!

37:42.042 --> 37:44.325
That lady you left us
with is a monster.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.065
Oh, is that so? Yeah.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.851
Last night she lit candles and
locked Michael and me in our rooms.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.114
- And she cooked some weird stew.
- Stop it.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.770
You promised me that you
would give her a chance.

37:54.794 --> 37:58.339
Because we need her. Ineed her.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.037
And so far it looks like she is

38:01.061 --> 38:03.822
the best thing that has
ever happened to us.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.476
I'm not crazy.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.547
I think she has wings.Noa. Stop.

38:10.766 --> 38:14.074
So we're gonna stick it out
with her a little bit. Okay?

38:18.252 --> 38:19.906
Fine.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.865
Hey, wait.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.506
Come.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.576
It is time for school.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.953
Noa.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.088
Noa.

39:16.223 --> 39:18.027
Noa.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.705
Noa.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.630
Hello?

39:32.282 --> 39:33.980
Follow me.

39:40.595 --> 39:43.119
Hello?

39:45.252 --> 39:47.080
Hello.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.519
Hello!

39:54.304 --> 39:56.457
Who are you?

39:56.481 --> 39:58.439
Emma.

40:22.550 --> 40:25.616
We're not really going
to school, are we?

40:25.640 --> 40:28.314
And what on Earth
makes you say that?

40:28.338 --> 40:32.299
I know all the shortcuts to school.
This ain't one of them.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.844
Tell me, Michael.

40:35.868 --> 40:38.261
What is it that you fear?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.893
The woods.

40:41.917 --> 40:46.008
Then it is best that you
confront that fear, is it not?

40:56.279 --> 40:58.301
Words are magic...

40:58.325 --> 41:01.435
Very old and powerful magic.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.046
They make the world real.

41:04.070 --> 41:07.441
They bring things out of the
darkness into the light of the fire

41:07.465 --> 41:09.597
where they can be understood.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.663
But there are older words...

41:12.687 --> 41:15.318
Words that most have forgotten.

41:15.342 --> 41:18.040
And so there are things
that remain unseen.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.890
Agas taoibh trid.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.848
Agas taoibh trid.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.982
Agas taoibh trid an
fialaigh gan eagla.

41:27.006 --> 41:31.010
Agas taoibh trid an
fialaigh gan eagla?

41:38.017 --> 41:40.367
This is the only way, Michael.

41:42.151 --> 41:45.000
The sacred shows
itself in nature.

41:45.024 --> 41:48.070
And this is where the
worlds converge.

41:49.594 --> 41:52.640
Where is your school
if not here, Michael?

41:54.381 --> 41:56.949
Kids call me a freak at school.

41:58.777 --> 42:01.103
Then this is where
you shall learn.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.955
Learn what?

42:03.869 --> 42:06.369
Water holds memories,

42:06.393 --> 42:07.960
and so does the earth.

42:23.802 --> 42:26.892
You are much more than
you know, Michael.

42:34.943 --> 42:36.423
Cool.

43:01.187 --> 43:03.121
As I live and breathe.

43:03.145 --> 43:04.819
Do you work here now, my dear?

43:04.843 --> 43:06.603
What? Wait. What are you doing?

43:06.627 --> 43:08.953
Emma Quinn. She was
a student here.

43:08.977 --> 43:11.826
So.

43:11.850 --> 43:14.374
Get out. Get out of my place.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.266
Why do you need to know that?

43:17.290 --> 43:20.598
I'm doing a story for
the school newspaper.

43:23.688 --> 43:26.623
The father said he
saw strange things.

43:26.647 --> 43:28.669
Said monsters stole
his daughter.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.845
Basically went mad.

43:30.869 --> 43:32.368
Naturally, he became a suspect,

43:32.392 --> 43:35.806
and his wife, um,
began to doubt him.

43:35.830 --> 43:39.854
And, uh, you know, everyone involved
just tore themselves apart.

43:39.878 --> 43:42.030
But in the end,
there was nothing.

43:42.054 --> 43:44.380
Eventually, just faded away.

43:44.404 --> 43:46.034
So this kid gets kidnapped,

43:46.058 --> 43:48.210
and nobody in this town
knows anything about it?

43:48.234 --> 43:51.648
Emma Quinn was the sweetest
girl you ever knew.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.999
And I combed the woods for months,
looking for her. We all did.

43:55.023 --> 43:57.480
Listen, you can't be
talking about those kind

43:57.492 --> 43:59.961
of things here in our
neck of the woods.

43:59.985 --> 44:02.572
In our redneck part of
the woods, you mean?

44:02.596 --> 44:04.443
Oh.

44:04.467 --> 44:08.689
Well, it's not quite
that simple, my dear.

44:10.952 --> 44:14.782
Everything has its own rhythms.

44:15.827 --> 44:18.351
Like, uh, right about now...

44:19.787 --> 44:23.637
Earl's postal truck is gonna
be coming down Oakland Avenue.

44:23.661 --> 44:27.641
Yates High's, uh, fifth
period bell's about to ring.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.861
Oh, and Greg Stillson is going to be...
Okay, okay,

44:30.885 --> 44:33.429
I don't even know who that is.

44:33.453 --> 44:37.041
That's because you are such in a
hurry to get out of this place

44:37.065 --> 44:41.611
that you've failed to...
look around.

44:41.635 --> 44:45.484
Like down at Odin's, the
old townies are gathering,

44:45.508 --> 44:48.096
and soon they're going
to be deep in the sauce

44:48.120 --> 44:50.576
and start talking
about mad things.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.951
That sounds really fascinating.

44:54.256 --> 44:56.824
You never know what
you might hear.

45:49.834 --> 45:52.856
Burger and chocolate milk.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.163
First time that's been
ordered here, I think.

45:55.187 --> 45:57.687
Need anything else, sweetie?

45:57.711 --> 46:00.018
This looks great. Thank you.

46:51.199 --> 46:53.680
You're too young.
Don't even try.

46:54.899 --> 46:56.877
The painting over
there, do you know...

46:56.901 --> 46:58.554
I don't know nothin' about it.

46:59.599 --> 47:01.882
It's quite old, you see.

47:01.906 --> 47:04.406
Before Mike's dad ever came
over from the old country.

47:04.430 --> 47:07.172
And he's been gone
some years now.

47:08.260 --> 47:12.936
It's just that tree thingy
looks very familiar.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.243
Just wondering if you
knew who painted it.

47:15.267 --> 47:16.940
Surely one of the greats.

47:16.964 --> 47:19.662
I mean, why else would it be
hanging in such a refined locale?

47:21.795 --> 47:23.362
Your food's gettin' cold.

47:24.189 --> 47:26.539
Well, thanks anyways.

47:27.714 --> 47:28.933
Hey.

47:30.021 --> 47:31.196
Your shirt's wet.

48:24.510 --> 48:25.748
Elkrog.

48:25.772 --> 48:26.836
What?

48:26.860 --> 48:28.142
Of the hidden world.

48:28.166 --> 48:30.709
Elkrog is the worst
of the worst.

48:30.733 --> 48:33.495
Always stealing the kids

48:33.519 --> 48:36.652
for his army to fight
the fairy king.

48:38.524 --> 48:42.049
When the moon turns to blood...

48:43.529 --> 48:44.723
tonight.

48:44.747 --> 48:47.272
I should've cut him
off 17 drinks ago.

48:48.577 --> 48:50.512
The fairy king...

48:50.536 --> 48:52.209
Is make-believe.

48:52.233 --> 48:55.604
The king and the queen
keep the fairies in tow,

48:55.628 --> 48:59.129
wishing to stay, but
then were forced to go.

48:59.153 --> 49:03.699
And when the good folks tried to
intervene and put on their best,

49:03.723 --> 49:08.660
they quickly found
themselves very distressed.

49:08.684 --> 49:13.230
For not all the fairies
are good to the core.

49:13.254 --> 49:17.539
The smart ones know to
look for the back door.

49:17.563 --> 49:20.281
Enough there, Mike.

49:20.305 --> 49:22.631
Pay him no mind, sweetie.

49:22.655 --> 49:26.461
The burger's on us, and don't come
back till you're of drinking age.

49:26.485 --> 49:28.811
And stop asking
about such things.

49:28.835 --> 49:31.814
Go, for your own good.

49:31.838 --> 49:33.729
My own good?

49:33.753 --> 49:35.668
Just be careful.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.570
Use iron,

49:48.594 --> 49:51.075
or tell 'em their true
name, if it comes to it.

49:51.989 --> 49:55.122
Only way to kill a fairy.

50:40.820 --> 50:42.343
Anyone here?

51:14.158 --> 51:15.787
You scared me.

51:15.811 --> 51:16.811
Yeah.

51:17.987 --> 51:20.164
I'm a little hungry.

51:27.388 --> 51:28.781
Don't you wanna come in?

51:31.000 --> 51:32.848
My, my.

51:32.872 --> 51:34.830
Aren't you a clever one.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.269
Tell me your real name.

51:39.879 --> 51:43.467
You are going through
changes, my dear.

51:43.491 --> 51:45.711
Nothing to be frightened of.

51:52.021 --> 51:55.373
You might ask yourself
what yourreal name is.

52:03.381 --> 52:05.185
You look so familiar.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.622
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

52:07.646 --> 52:09.754
I mean, it-it's possible.

52:09.778 --> 52:11.737
I do a lot of work for the town.

52:13.042 --> 52:17.003
So, tell me more about
that nanny you just hired.

52:18.091 --> 52:19.938
We literally interviewed...

52:19.962 --> 52:23.638
I think there was a list of 24...
Literally, 24 people.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.814
Twenty That's two dozen.

52:25.838 --> 52:29.861
And, mmm, it was like, not...
They didn't like anyone.

52:29.885 --> 52:33.454
But they actually were kind
of pulling my leg on that.

52:34.586 --> 52:37.869
But I'm confused, because
Leonor is amazing.

52:37.893 --> 52:42.526
She's from the, uh,
Spenser Domestic Agency?

52:42.550 --> 52:45.181
Have you ever heard
of that place?

52:45.205 --> 52:46.989
Yeah, I have.

52:48.339 --> 52:49.968
Do you have kids?

52:49.992 --> 52:53.581
I'm sorry. I should have
asked that a while ago.

52:53.605 --> 52:57.019
- I had a daughter, but...
- Oh, my God.

52:57.043 --> 53:00.873
I'm so sorry. I'm such an
idiot for asking like that.

53:02.614 --> 53:04.940
How could you've known?

53:04.964 --> 53:07.247
Happened a long time ago.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.249
But you know what?
It gave me purpose.

53:09.273 --> 53:10.946
I wish it never happened,

53:10.970 --> 53:14.626
but, uh, it defined the
life I live today.

53:22.286 --> 53:25.027
I don't think I even
know what you do.

53:26.115 --> 53:28.224
Did you tell me? I'm...
I'm sorry.

53:28.248 --> 53:31.271
I'm really out of practice.

53:31.295 --> 53:33.011
Short version,

53:33.035 --> 53:36.754
I, uh, help keep kids safe.

53:36.778 --> 53:38.930
Long version, I'll
have to tell you

53:38.954 --> 53:41.106
when I get to know you
a little bit better.

53:41.130 --> 53:44.482
Which I am looking forward to.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.295
Uh...

53:55.319 --> 53:57.253
I had a really good time.

53:57.277 --> 53:58.757
Me too.

54:02.195 --> 54:05.479
I have to warn you though. Most of
my nights are spent at the hospital.

54:05.503 --> 54:08.786
I'll be patient.

54:08.810 --> 54:10.832
Do you mind if I
use your restroom?

54:10.856 --> 54:13.574
I know it's a little early to
have a strange man in your house,

54:13.598 --> 54:15.793
but, um I know kids,

54:15.817 --> 54:17.950
and I promise to
stay out of sight.

54:19.343 --> 54:21.669
So just straight
through the hall.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.695
It's the second
door on the right.

54:39.798 --> 54:41.060
You okay?

54:46.500 --> 54:47.893
Who are you?

54:48.546 --> 54:50.306
My name is David.

54:50.330 --> 54:52.265
I'm a friend of your mom's.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.267
But don't tell her you saw me.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.312
What happened?

54:56.336 --> 54:58.730
And she's dating again?

54:59.774 --> 55:01.622
My God.

55:01.646 --> 55:04.083
Did that Spenser witch hurt you?

55:05.780 --> 55:08.130
Yeah. How did you know that?

55:09.262 --> 55:10.872
Can I see?

55:22.406 --> 55:24.862
I'm not a freak, okay?

55:24.886 --> 55:27.517
Our new nanny, she
did this to me.

55:27.541 --> 55:29.258
And she's not a witch.
She's a...

55:29.282 --> 55:30.892
A fairy. I know.

55:31.980 --> 55:33.741
Yes. How did you...

55:33.765 --> 55:35.308
That's not important.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.398
What's important is you have
to stay away from her. Okay?

55:38.422 --> 55:39.901
Stay away.

55:45.951 --> 55:48.127
Wait! Hey!

55:50.172 --> 55:52.542
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:52.566 --> 55:55.415
How did you know she's a...

55:55.439 --> 55:57.179
A fairy?

55:58.572 --> 56:01.706
Well, let's just say I know
a fairy when I see one.

56:06.058 --> 56:07.494
Check it out?

56:14.327 --> 56:16.155
Here, I'll show you. Come here.

56:21.813 --> 56:24.946
Took me years to complete.

56:26.252 --> 56:27.751
But as far as I know,

56:27.775 --> 56:31.649
this is the only, uh, fairy-proof
mobile containment unit.

56:34.173 --> 56:36.238
Go on. Check it out.

56:36.262 --> 56:37.829
Okay.

56:44.488 --> 56:48.859
Okay, but how are we
gonna get her in here?

56:48.883 --> 56:50.470
Well, that's the tough part.

56:50.494 --> 56:54.561
But once she's in here,
no fairy can escape.

56:54.585 --> 56:57.239
Not Elkrog. Not her.

56:58.545 --> 57:00.305
Not you.

57:00.329 --> 57:01.548
Wait! No!

57:05.030 --> 57:06.205
Hey!

57:15.693 --> 57:18.565
What are you doing?
Let me out of here.

57:20.045 --> 57:21.699
Please.

57:22.917 --> 57:23.917
Please!

57:29.576 --> 57:31.293
Why are you doing this?

57:31.317 --> 57:35.321
It's too late for you, but Emma may
still be in the liminal stage.

57:37.236 --> 57:38.716
Stop it!

57:54.471 --> 57:57.082
Sit down, or I'll zap you again.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.732
I'm not a fairy.

58:18.756 --> 58:20.560
Well, then how do
you explain those?

58:20.584 --> 58:23.911
I... I don't know.
Leonor did it to me.

58:23.935 --> 58:28.393
I'm gonna take care of her too. Don't
worry about her. That's why you're here.

58:28.417 --> 58:29.873
I'm not. Please.

58:29.897 --> 58:33.442
I... I was trying to stop her.

58:33.466 --> 58:36.750
I believe you. I really do.

58:36.774 --> 58:38.340
But here's the thing.

58:39.951 --> 58:43.452
I've traveled to Donegal
and hunted leprechauns,

58:43.476 --> 58:44.956
yokaiin Japan.

58:45.826 --> 58:48.089
And you, my dear,

58:49.177 --> 58:50.831
are a fairy.

58:56.141 --> 58:58.796
Now, you're going through
a period of transition.

58:59.710 --> 59:01.233
And that witch...

59:02.495 --> 59:04.105
is gonna want you back.

59:13.898 --> 59:15.615
Have you seen Noa?

59:15.639 --> 59:17.858
She's not in her room, and...

59:18.859 --> 59:20.818
her phone is off.

59:25.518 --> 59:27.931
Usually... call it intuition...

59:27.955 --> 59:33.004
I can sense my little ones
out there, but... I can't.

59:35.833 --> 59:38.139
It is strange that I can't.

59:39.227 --> 59:42.013
Who did you let into this house?

59:44.102 --> 59:45.819
Get up.

59:45.843 --> 59:49.020
Please, there has to be some way I
can prove to you that I'm normal.

59:51.022 --> 59:53.894
You don't have half an
idea of what you are.

59:54.765 --> 59:56.157
Get up.

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:05.340
Emma Quinn.

01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:07.212
What...

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.736
What'd you say?

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.716
Have you seen her? In your
world Have you seen her?

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.936
She's about the same
age as she was.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.224
Please, I... I just want
my daughter back, okay?

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:24.882
Okay.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.233
Get up. Get up, get up.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.499
Get up and get in that cage.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.982
Put those shackles on.

01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.420
Hurry up.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:17.954
This is just so not like her.
She's...

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:21.018
Mad as she gets, rebellious, whatever,
this is... I... Something is not right.

01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:23.133
Could she have gone
to a friend's house?

01:01:23.157 --> 01:01:26.006
Maybe her phone just died.
That happens all the time.

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.790
Noa?

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:30.793
Anna, I promise you,
we will find her.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:33.448
Just give me names,
uh, hangout spots,

01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:35.102
um, ev-everything.

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:37.539
What about that girl she used
to hang out with? Uh, Ariana.

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:40.281
Ariel. No, they're not
even friends anymore.

01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:42.544
I don't even know who
her friends are now.

01:01:42.568 --> 01:01:45.068
I know precisely where Noa is.

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:47.027
The man you allowed
into the house,

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:49.140
near my children, has taken her.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.905
Did you just say, "my children"?

01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:57.864
Such a shame, Anna.

01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.953
You should not have
trusted that man.

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:01.476
"That man."

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.217
You don't even know him.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:06.287
I'm afraid, my dear,
neither do you.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.266
Who do you think you are?

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.660
Was this, like, a
date man or, uh...

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:12.835
Frank. Sorry.

01:02:12.859 --> 01:02:14.924
Leave it to me.

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:17.013
Only I know how to find her.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.474
Only I know how
to keep her safe.

01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:22.802
She's my daughter.

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:25.567
No, Mommy. She isn't.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:28.546
What did you just say?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.984
Michael, get out of the car.
There's a good boy.

01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:33.377
No, no, no. You
stay right there.

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.553
What has this woman
been telling you?

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:38.687
I think, everybody, maybe
we should just calm down.

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.254
Stay out of this, Frank. Okay.

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:42.367
Get out.

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:48.784
It's too dangerous for
him, here with you.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:51.332
Oh, and he's safer with you?

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:54.031
You're scaring him.

01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.708
Hey, Anna, what's going on?

01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:02.102
Hey, hang on, okay? Stay right there.
I'm on my way.

01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:04.104
No, we're coming to you.

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:08.088
Your services will no
longer be required.

01:03:10.047 --> 01:03:12.310
And you'll be the judge
of that, will you?

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.529
I am their mother.

01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:17.968
Are you quite sure of that now?

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:44.429
Noa!

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:49.695
Noa!

01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:54.700
Noa, come out, sweetheart.
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

01:04:01.533 --> 01:04:02.533
Noa.

01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.012
He's a monster.

01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.037
Aah!

01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:45.466
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna find her, okay?

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.772
The town's not that big.
We'll turn it upside down.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:50.297
Think of any friends that
maybe she would have gone to.

01:04:50.321 --> 01:04:52.386
Hideout spots or, uh,
friends' houses.

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.475
Kids do this all the time.

01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:55.587
Do they?

01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:00.960
Um, I'll take him.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:04.485
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay, we'll take my car.

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:05.509
Okay.Okay.

01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:08.968
She said something about a man?

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.926
Like, uh, you were seeing a man?

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:12.493
Are you seeing a man.

01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:14.408
Frank, this is not the
time to get jealous.

01:05:14.432 --> 01:05:16.062
Oh, Anna, I'm not
getting jealous.

01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:18.803
We need to cover all of our bases here.
You don't know this guy.

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:21.850
He was in the house. He could be
some kind of creep or have a record.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:25.201
I'm not gonna just let a creep
into my house, around my kids.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:27.662
Give me a little credit, okay?

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.100
What was his name?

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:33.668
His name is David Quinn.

01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:37.672
David Quinn? You
said David Quinn?

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:39.543
Yeah.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.722
I... I know David Quinn.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.005
How?

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:48.094
Everybody knows David Quinn.

01:05:48.118 --> 01:05:49.641
That's where we're going.

01:07:19.557 --> 01:07:20.925
Sorry, Noa.

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.865
I'm afraid this concludes
our little fairy tale.

01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.131
Help!

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:54.244
Help!

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.508
Help!

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.882
It's time for us to
be heading home,

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:07.213
my daughter.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.828
Noa?

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.839
Oh, my God.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:13.341
I'm gonna need additional
units at 17728 Marana Drive.

01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:15.455
Send a coroner.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.591
What is this place?

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:25.421
What the hell is that?

01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:30.992
This is Noa's hat.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:32.796
Noa?

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:33.865
Noa!

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.027
Noa! Noa!

01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:31.051
Noa!

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.141
Oh, please.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:37.383
Yeah.

01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:40.212
You need to come back to
the school right away.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.367
Michael's been taken.

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:54.487
If you're my mother, why
did I grow up here?

01:10:54.511 --> 01:10:57.688
Many fairy children
ended up in orphanages.

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:00.971
Elkrog had seized power.

01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:04.453
He would have hunted you
down and killed you.

01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:07.524
Or worse, made you join him.

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:11.417
No. This is all crazy.

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:14.966
It's time for you to let go of
everything you think you know.

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:19.599
Are you so stuck in the
drudgery of this world

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:22.582
that you cannot hear the
whispers all around you?

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:29.348
You are not just my daughter.

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:31.741
You are the protector.

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:35.528
For there are dark forces afoot,

01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:37.554
and we must fight them.

01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:49.106
What happened? It took Michael.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.847
It? In the park.

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:53.197
In the woods, where
Emma went missing.

01:11:53.221 --> 01:11:55.441
North Stream Park. North Stream Park.
Let's go.

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:07.255
I always got a strange
feeling here.

01:12:07.279 --> 01:12:08.889
Are you frightened?

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:15.263
Is my brother... Is...

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:17.744
Elkrog has not left yet.

01:12:17.768 --> 01:12:20.703
I shall show you across,

01:12:20.727 --> 01:12:23.469
and then I will deal with
him once and for all.

01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:31.410
I shan't be long behind.

01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:33.697
With your brother
in my loving arms.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.222
What's on the other side?

01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:40.617
Your home.

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.967
Your true home.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:48.189
I'll be able to come
back here someday.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:50.888
Right?

01:12:55.632 --> 01:12:57.634
Where's my daughter?

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:04.075
Some fairies, like this
little girl, I kill quickly.

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:06.643
Painless.

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:11.648
But I'm gonna make you suffer...

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.304
unless you tell
me where Emma is.

01:13:23.442 --> 01:13:24.835
Tell me.

01:13:30.493 --> 01:13:31.929
Daddy.

01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:35.976
Emma?

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:50.034
Emma.

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:53.037
Sweetheart.

01:13:59.391 --> 01:14:01.306
I've missed you so much.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:28.265
Join us...

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:30.291
or join him.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.109
Noa?

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:10.070
Noa. Noa.Noa.

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:16.052
Wake up, baby. Wake up.

01:15:16.076 --> 01:15:18.925
I need backup units and an ambulance
right away. North Stream Park.

01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:21.212
Wake up.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:27.653
Shh.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.874
He is upon us.

01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:41.798
Michael?

01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:40.726
No!

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.037
Cool.

01:18:34.231 --> 01:18:36.146
Where did she go?

01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:43.216
Always remember.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.982
Remember. Remember.

01:18:57.558 --> 01:19:00.799
Every day I see more
of the hidden world.

01:19:00.823 --> 01:19:04.063
Sometimes it's just a feeling.

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:06.848
I need to face the
darkness to see the light.

01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:10.330
More and more I
understand who I am,

01:19:10.354 --> 01:19:14.073
where I come from, and
what I'm capable of.

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:16.684
I know I'll go there
someday when I'm ready.

01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.468
But for now,

01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:22.777
I've got a family,
here in this world,

01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:24.847
and I've got to keep 'em safe.

01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:56.855
There she is. Hi!

01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:57.899
Hi.Hey.

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.074
Welcome.

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:02.928
What about dinner.

01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:09.935
Never forget where
you came from.

01:20:11.241 --> 01:20:15.071
In the hidden world lurk
dangers yet to come.

01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:19.945
You must keep your eyes
and your spirit open.

01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:24.602
You must never forget
who you truly are.
