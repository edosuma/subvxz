A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:14.133 --> 00:15.500

00:15.533 --> 00:17.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE SAYING IT EARLIER,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.433
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME,
AND I'M GOING TO SAY IT,

00:18.467 --> 00:20.133
I'M ON THE SCREEN
OF A MOVIE.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.733
MY NAME IS THE ONLY NAME UP
AS THE SOLE WRITING CREDIT.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.400
THAT IS EXCITING.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.467
RIGHT, IT'S THE FIRST TIME
WITH AN AUDIENCE,

00:25.500 --> 00:26.867

OH, I'M GLAD YOU
COULD JOIN US.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.967
WE'RE WAITING
IN LINE HERE.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.100
SORRY, UH,
UH, I'M LATE.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.100
I JUST COULDN'T
PICK OUT AN OUTFIT.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.600
OH, STOP IT.

00:40.633 --> 00:43.167
IT'S ACTUALLY THE TRUTH,
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING ABOUT IT.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.500
I DROVE BY
THE THEATER.

00:44.533 --> 00:46.133
I SAW THE MARQUIS.

00:46.167 --> 00:47.267
YEAH, RIGHT,
AND HOW'S THAT LOOK ?

00:47.300 --> 00:48.267
IT LOOKS GREAT.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.267
THE NUMBERS 30...

00:49.300 --> 00:50.800
SPELLING THAT OUT.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.867
AND WE GOT TO GET
A PICTURE OF THAT TOO.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.667
OH, YES, YOU HAVE
TO GET A PICTURE.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.267
THIS IS A BIG NIGHT,
YEAH.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.233
VERY EXCITED.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.167
SO, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE IDEA ?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.233
SHELLEY WAS TELLING ME
SOMETHING ABOUT...

01:01.267 --> 01:02.567
CLIFF COBB,
TABLE OF FOUR ?

01:02.600 --> 01:03.933
OH, GREAT, GREAT.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.433
YOU KNOW WHAT, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE, THANK YOU.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.067
TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU
PUT YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO...

01:09.100 --> 01:10.367
WELL, IT CHANGES
THE WHOLE PROCESS,

01:10.400 --> 01:11.367
IT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.367
IF YOU'RE JUST
A WRITER FOR HIRE...

01:12.400 --> 01:14.367
HEY, HOW'S CHERYL'S
PRESENT COMING ?

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
OH, IT'S JUST
BEAUTIFUL.

01:15.433 --> 01:16.733
YEAH ?

01:16.767 --> 01:18.233
YEAH, ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL BRACELETS I'VE MADE,

01:18.267 --> 01:19.267
I HAVE TO SAY.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.600
YOU KNOW, HER BIRTHDAY'S
ON FRIDAY, SO I...

01:21.633 --> 01:22.667
YOU'LL HAVE IT BEFORE THEN,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.700
I NEED IT
BY THURSDAY.

01:23.733 --> 01:24.767
NO PROBLEM,
NO PROBLEM.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.600
GREAT, THANK YOU,
THANKS SO MUCH.

01:27.633 --> 01:30.100
I KNOW, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'VE BEEN.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.800
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET TO THE AMAZON--

01:31.833 --> 01:34.333
YOU HAVE GOT TO GO,
IF YOU, IF YOU...

01:34.367 --> 01:36.067
IT'S PARTICULARLY
WEST OF THE RIVER.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.233
YEAH.

01:37.267 --> 01:38.800
LIKE, UP NORTH A LITTLE BIT,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.967
AND IS IT JUST,
IS IT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ?

01:41.067 --> 01:42.433
YEAH, IT'S, WELL,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,

01:42.467 --> 01:44.533
IT'S YOU AND GUIDES IN A GROUP,
BUT IT'S A LARGE GROUP.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.633
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHICH
COMPANY YOU GO THROUGH,

01:46.667 --> 01:50.133
THEY'LL PUT TOGETHER
DIFFERENT GROUPS TO GO OUT,

01:50.167 --> 01:51.400
ARE THERE
TONS OF SNAKES ?

01:51.433 --> 01:52.633
THERE'S TONS
OF EVERYTHING.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.267
RIGHT, BUT THAT'S
WHY YOU GO, RIGHT ?

01:54.300 --> 01:55.300
'CAUSE YOU
WANT TO SEE IT.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.100
FORGOT MY NAPKIN.

01:57.133 --> 02:00.200
RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ETIQUETTE.

02:00.233 --> 02:04.100
VERY IMPORTANT,
MUST PUT THE NAPKIN ON.

02:04.133 --> 02:07.867
IT SEEMS SILLY TO PUT A NAPKIN
ON AN OLD PAIR OF PANTS.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.067
UNLESS THERE WAS, LIKE,
SOME KIND OF HUGE EMERGENCY.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.167
ARE WE READY ?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.367
YES, PLEASE.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.633
OKAY, I THINK I'LL HAVE
THE GRILLED SALMON.

02:15.667 --> 02:16.700
GRILLED SALMON.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.533
YEAH, ME TOO,
ACTUALLY, SAME THING.

02:18.567 --> 02:19.867
I'LL HAVE THE PAELLA.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.300
OKAY, GOOD CHOICE.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.867
UM, I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA GET A...

02:23.900 --> 02:26.600
A COBB SALAD.

02:26.633 --> 02:27.767
OKAY.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.533
OKAY, AND, I WANT TO
MAKE JUST A COUPLE

02:30.567 --> 02:31.733
OF SUBSTITUTIONS
IF THAT'S OKAY ?

02:31.767 --> 02:32.800
SURE.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.600
OKAY, UM...

02:34.633 --> 02:37.600
I'LL GET,
UH, NO BACON.

02:37.633 --> 02:38.733
NO BACON.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.900
NO EGGS.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.067
NO EGGS.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.900
NO EGGS.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.267
BLEU CHEESE
ON THE SIDE.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.600
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT A COBB SALAD ?

02:48.633 --> 02:50.733
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
GET SOMETHING ELSE.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.967
I'M GETTING
A DAVID SALAD.

02:53.067 --> 02:54.133
YEAH, IT IS
A DAVID SALAD.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.667
AND I'LL GET, UH,
ADD CUCUMBERS, IF YOU CAN.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.067
OKAY, YEAH, AND
IF THE CHEF CAN'T DO THIS,

02:59.067 --> 03:01.500
IF HE MAKES A FACE AT ALL,
JUST COME BACK AND LET ME KNOW.

03:01.533 --> 03:02.600
NO FACES.

03:02.633 --> 03:04.567
YEAH, ALRIGHT,
OKAY, THANK YOU.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.700
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:06.733 --> 03:10.167
DO YOU, GO THROUGH THAT EVERY
TIME YOU ORDER THAT SALAD ?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.733
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT OF SOME KIND.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.367
IS IT A BIG DEAL,
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.433
A LITTLE, WELL, IT'S
MY GRANDFATHER'S SALAD.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.933
AND, YEAH,
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.267
HERE WE GO.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.333
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
IT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER'S SALAD ?

03:23.367 --> 03:25.400
MY GRANDFATHER CREATED
THE COBB SALAD.

03:25.433 --> 03:26.433
IS THAT TRUE ?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.800
I'M THE COBB
OF COBB SALAD.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.367
HE'S TOLD
THIS MANY TIMES.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.500
OH, MY GOD.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.167
UH, THIS IS A NICE
LITTLE BULLSHIT STORY

03:32.200 --> 03:33.767
YOU'VE GOT GOING HERE...

03:33.800 --> 03:35.133
UH, HEY, HEY, HEY,
I'M NOT LYING ABOUT THIS.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.233
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A CHEF.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.500
HE WORKED ALL OVER,

03:37.533 --> 03:39.800
AND, UH, THERE WAS A TIME
HE WAS AT THE DRAKE HOTEL,

03:39.833 --> 03:41.867
WORKING, CHICAGO,
AND HE...

03:41.900 --> 03:44.333
HE WOULD EXPERIMENT WITH
DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS,

03:44.367 --> 03:46.167
AND THE WORD
GOT OUT.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.600
THAT'S HOW THE COBB SALAD
WAS BORN.

03:47.633 --> 03:48.667
( laughing )

03:48.700 --> 03:50.833
WHY IS THAT
SO HARD TO BELIEVE ?

03:50.867 --> 03:53.333
IT'S SO
UNBELIEVABLE THAT...

03:53.367 --> 03:56.133
SO MANY PEOPLE DO
WHAT YOU JUST DID.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.567
AND I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.933
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS,
I'M NEVER GOING TO DO IT AGAIN,

03:58.967 --> 04:02.600
NO, NO, NO, NO,
I APOLOGIZE.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.333
I'M JUMPY TONIGHT,
I'M JUMPY TONIGHT,

04:04.367 --> 04:05.433
THE MOVIE, AND...

04:05.467 --> 04:07.533
I WAS THINKING, WHAT DOES
HE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT

04:07.567 --> 04:09.400
WHAT I AM ORDERING
IN MY SALAD, YOU KNOW.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.500
LET'S, WHAT WERE
WE SAYING ?

04:11.533 --> 04:14.567
WE WERE ACTUALLY, I WANT
TO GET OUT IN THE ROUGH.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.067
RIGHT, OH,
WELL, AMAZONS.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.100
BUT DID I TELL YOU THAT
I HAVE A VERY GOOD FRIEND

04:18.133 --> 04:19.700
THAT WENT TO
SOUTH AFRICA ?

04:19.733 --> 04:20.800
OH, SOUTH AFRICA.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.733
YEAH, BUT HE DID,
HE WENT FOR A HUNTING TRIP.

04:23.767 --> 04:26.767
YOU KNOW, MY GRANDFATHER'S
NAME WAS, WAS HAROLD BINGO,

04:26.800 --> 04:28.433
AND HE INVENTED BINGO.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.900
ARE YOU AWARE
OF THAT ?

04:29.933 --> 04:33.267
DO YOU MOVE YOUR CAMP
OR IS IT A BASE CAMP...

04:34.967 --> 04:36.067
WE COULD BE TALKING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.200
THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY IDEA.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.233
THEY'VE GOT
THEIR OWN TABLE.

04:38.267 --> 04:39.267
THEY'VE GOT
THEIR OWN TABLE.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.633
IT DOESN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.567
... SO CLOSE TO
THESE ANIMALS.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.200
SO, WE SHOULD HAVE
SEX SOME TIME.

04:45.233 --> 04:49.067
YES, WE SHOULD.

04:49.067 --> 04:52.133
SO, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT...

05:01.167 --> 05:03.667
LARRY,
HOW YOU DOING ?

05:03.700 --> 05:05.467
LONG TIME NO SEE,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.933
WHAT'S NEW ?

05:06.967 --> 05:07.967
AH, NOT TOO MUCH.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.067
NOT TOO MUCH ?

05:09.067 --> 05:10.067
HOW ABOUT YOU ?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.100
PLAYING A LOT
OF GOLF.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.300
REALLY ?YEAH.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.567
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
PLAY SOME TIME.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.367
I DON'T PLAY GOLF.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.967
SINCE WHEN ?

05:19.067 --> 05:20.533
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN
A LONG, LONG TIME.

05:20.567 --> 05:21.600
YOU DON'T PLAY
GOLF ANYMORE ?

05:21.633 --> 05:22.667
NO.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.233
OH, LARRY, COME ON.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.700
HEY, LISTEN,
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

05:25.733 --> 05:26.767
LET ME KNOW, OKAY ?

05:26.800 --> 05:27.900
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.433
SO, GLAD YOU
COULD MAKE IT.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.533
GO GET A SEAT.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.367
LISTEN, I'M GONNA
CHECK THE HOUSE.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.467
OKAY.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.933
SEE YOU IN A SEC.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.300
( whistling )

05:39.667 --> 05:41.200
WHAT IS THAT ?

05:41.233 --> 05:42.200
I DON'T KNOW
THAT ONE.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.233
IT'S VOGNER.

05:43.267 --> 05:44.300
REALLY ?

05:44.333 --> 05:45.667
IT'S CALLED
SIGFRIED IDLE.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.533
AND HE WROTE IT AS A BIRTHDAY
PRESENT FOR HIS WIFE, COSIMA.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.400
SHE WOKE UP IN
THE MORNING,

05:51.433 --> 05:53.333
AND SHE HEARD THIS
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC

05:53.367 --> 05:54.400
AND SHE CAME OUT
ON THE LANDING

05:54.433 --> 05:56.900
AND HE WAS CONDUCTING
THIS ORCHESTRA.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.267
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, TOO.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.600
SO ROMANTIC.

05:59.633 --> 06:00.700
YEAH, LISTEN TO THIS.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.300
( whistling )

06:05.300 --> 06:06.967
IT'S PRETTY.

06:09.233 --> 06:10.933
EXCUSE ME.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.167
ARE YOU JEWISH ?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.967
ARE YOU JEWISH ?

06:19.067 --> 06:21.900
YOU WANT TO
CHECK MY PENIS ?

06:21.933 --> 06:23.300
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO ?

06:23.333 --> 06:25.433
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
WHAT WERE YOU WHISTLING ?

06:25.467 --> 06:27.533
YEAH, WHAT WERE
YOU WHISTLING ?

06:27.567 --> 06:28.833
"HELLO, DOLLY".

06:28.867 --> 06:30.067
NO, WAS IT VOGNER ?

06:30.067 --> 06:32.533
OH, WAS IT ?

06:32.567 --> 06:36.100
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT A JEW
IS WHISTLING VOGNER FOR.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.367
WHEN HE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
ANTI-SEMITES OF THE WORLD.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.433
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE ?

06:39.467 --> 06:40.533
WHAT AM I ?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.400
YOU'RE A SELF-
LOATHING JEW.

06:42.433 --> 06:43.533
AM I ?

06:43.567 --> 06:46.067
WELL, I DO HATE MYSELF,

06:46.067 --> 06:48.133
BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING JEWISH, OKAY ?

06:48.167 --> 06:50.067
NO, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEWS.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.433
IT'S MILLIONS OF JEWS WERE TAKEN
TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS...

06:52.467 --> 06:53.500
ALRIGHT, OKAY.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.967
WITH VOGNER BEING PLAYED
IN THE BACKGROUND...

06:56.067 --> 06:57.633
HITLER'S FAVORITE
COMPOSER.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.100
YES.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.100
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY GOT A MENTAL
ASYLUM A COUPLE OF BLOCKS DOWN.

07:01.133 --> 07:03.467
NO, NOT A MENTAL ASYLUM,
NO, NO, NO.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.967
WHERE IS
YOUR HERITAGE ?

07:05.067 --> 07:06.667
WHERE IS
YOUR JUDAISM ?

07:06.700 --> 07:08.833
JUDAISM,
WHERE ARE YOU ?

07:08.867 --> 07:10.967
WHERE ARE YOU,
JUDAISM ?

07:11.067 --> 07:13.767
THIS ATTITUDE
THAT YOU'RE BETTER...

07:13.800 --> 07:15.467
YEAH, THEY SHOULD
PUT A MUZZLE ON YOU,

07:15.500 --> 07:17.067
YOU'RE FOAMING
AT THE MOUTH.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.067
PLEASE, THANK YOU.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.600
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO THINK ABOUT, ALRIGHT ?

07:21.633 --> 07:22.833
HEY, HOW ARE YOU ?

07:22.867 --> 07:24.567
WHAT'S GOING ON,
EVERYTHING ALRIGHT ?

07:24.600 --> 07:27.300
NO, NO, NO, NOT, BUT I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO YOUR MOVIE.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.800
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.067
GET A SEAT, I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.133

07:34.267 --> 07:35.333
YEAH, HE LIVES

07:35.367 --> 07:37.967
HE LIVES TWO STREETS AWAY,
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.067
REALLY OBNOXIOUS.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.500
COME ON, WE SHOULD
GET A SEAT, COME ON.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.067
( crunching noises )

08:02.333 --> 08:04.467
CAN YOU KEEP
IT DOWN ?

08:04.500 --> 08:07.467
I'M ALLOWED
TO EAT POPCORN.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.367
STOP IT.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.067
I'M TIRED,
I'M SORRY.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
MAZEL TOV,

GREAT JOB.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.467
THANK YOU

09:00.500 --> 09:02.567
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU HAD THAT GUY DIVE INTO

09:02.600 --> 09:03.633
THAT ICE
COLD WATER.

09:03.667 --> 09:04.633
YOU LIKED THAT ?

09:04.667 --> 09:06.100
YEAH, I MEAN, MY GOD.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.933
AND I KNOW IT'S FREEZING OUT,
'CAUSE YOU COULD SEE THE SMOKE

09:07.967 --> 09:09.300
COMING OUT
OF HIS MOUTH.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.733
IS IT SMOKE, WHAT COMES OUT OF
YOUR MOUTH IN THE COLD WEATHER ?

09:10.767 --> 09:11.833
NO, IT'S BREATH.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.333
IT'S BREATH, BUT IT
LOOKS LIKE SMOKE.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.933
YOU REALLY LIKE THAT ?

09:14.967 --> 09:16.600
I JUST TOLD YOU

09:19.200 --> 09:20.600
HEY, WE SHOULD GO UP

09:24.433 --> 09:25.867
YOU GOT A BIG
DAY TOMORROW.

09:25.900 --> 09:26.900
HE'S GOT TO
GET HIS SLEEP.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.967
WHAT YOU GOT
GOING ON TOMORROW ?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.667
NOTHING, I'M JUST
SITTING AROUND.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.667
I'M NOT, I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.467
I DON'T HAVE TO.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.433
WELL, WE'RE TIRED TOO,

09:36.467 --> 09:37.433

I'M SITTING AROUND,

09:37.467 --> 09:38.433
I'M NOT DOING

09:38.467 --> 09:39.600
SITTING AROUND ?

09:39.633 --> 09:41.067
SO, LISTEN, THANK YOU,
UH, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.167

HOPE YOU LIKED IT.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.167
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.367
( Cheryl )
I WANT TO SEE
THOSE PICTURES...

09:47.400 --> 09:48.433
( Cliff )
I'LL GET YOU
THE PICTURES.

09:48.467 --> 09:49.967
AND EVERYTHING
WAS PERFECT.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.833
YOU SHOULD
FEEL SO PROUD.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.267
NO, YEAH,
I LOVED IT.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.067
I REALLY, HONESTLY, I DID,
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.133
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO ?

10:02.167 --> 10:03.167
WANDA.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.567
UM, YEAH, NO,
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.500
I LOVED EVERY MINUTE.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.900
AND THEN I LOOK OVER,
AND LARRY'S YAWNING.

10:10.933 --> 10:14.633
WHAT, I, I, I,
I WASN'T BORED.

10:14.667 --> 10:18.267
CAN'T SOMEBODY BE
TIRED AND YAWN ?

10:18.300 --> 10:20.000
I MEAN, IT'S
A BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.167
HE INVITED US
TO THAT SCREENING.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MEAN YOU'RE BORED.

10:23.233 --> 10:25.500
I KNOW, I THOUGHT
IT WAS RUDE.

10:25.533 --> 10:28.900
IT WAS RUDE, YEAH, IT WAS RUDE,
YEAH, IT REALLY RUDE,

10:28.933 --> 10:30.133
DO YOU KNOW
WHO CLIFF IS ?

10:30.167 --> 10:31.333
CLIFF COBB ?

10:31.367 --> 10:32.967
YEAH, THE CUTE GUY IN
THE WHEELCHAIR, YEAH.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.300
SO, WE'RE IN THE LOBBY AND WE'RE
TALKING TO HIM AFTERWARD,

10:35.333 --> 10:36.633
AND EVERYONE'S
CONGRATULATING HIM

10:36.667 --> 10:38.033
AND HE'S HAVING
THIS GREAT NIGHT.

10:38.067 --> 10:40.967
AND THEN HE ASKS LARRY
WHAT HE'S DOING TOMORROW,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.467
AND LARRY SAYS THAT
HE'S JUST SITTING AROUND.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
HEY !

10:44.533 --> 10:46.800
INSTEAD OF JUST,
HEY, AND SAYING GOLF...

10:46.833 --> 10:47.833
DON'T TELL HER THAT,
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TELL HER ?

10:47.867 --> 10:49.767
HE CAN'T SAY
HE'S PLAYING GOLF,

10:49.800 --> 10:51.300
HE TELLS HIM THAT
HE'S GONNA SIT AROUND.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.867
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE HIM FEEL BAD.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.200
WHY DO I HAVE TO SAY
I'M GOING OUT ?

10:54.233 --> 10:56.533
IF I WAS HANDICAPPED, I WOULD
WANT PEOPLE TO TELL ME

10:56.567 --> 10:58.300
THAT THEY'RE
SITTING AROUND.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.133
I'M GOING GOLFING
OR HORSEBACK RIDING.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.567
SO, HE DOESN'T
GET UPSET.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.767
HEY, IF I WAS
PLAYING CHECKERS,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.533
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
I'M PLAYING CHECKERS.

11:06.567 --> 11:07.900
SO, HE WAS TRYING TO
MAKE CLIFF FEEL GOOD.

11:07.933 --> 11:08.933
THAT'S A GOOD
THING TO SAY.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.167
AND WHAT ABOUT
THAT OTHER GUY ?

11:10.200 --> 11:11.900
WHY'D YOU TELL HIM THAT
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING GOLF ?

11:11.933 --> 11:13.467
BECAUSE CLIFF WAS
RIGHT NEXT TO ME,

11:13.500 --> 11:18.067
SO, I DIDN'T WANT CLIFF
TO KNOW I'M PLAYING GOLF.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.667
ALSO, I DON'T WANT TO
PLAY WITH THAT GUY ANYWAY

11:19.700 --> 11:20.733
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.767
CAN YOU BELIEVE ?

11:22.800 --> 11:25.233
HE'S OUT OF
HIS MIND !

11:25.267 --> 11:28.633
I KNOW, HE THINKS HE'S
DOING A REALLY GOOD THING.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.733
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

11:32.767 --> 11:33.967
OKAY, I GOT

16:25.500 --> 16:26.767
TOILET PAPER
YOUR HOUSE ?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.733
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
GOING TO BE FELONY OR TREAT.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.533
I DIDN'T THINK THE TRICK
EXTENDED TO FELONIES.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.067
WHY WOULD IT KILL YOU
JUST TO GIVE THEM

16:33.067 --> 16:34.133
A FEW PIECES
OF CANDY ?

16:34.167 --> 16:35.400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.200
BECAUSE THERE'S GOT TO
BE SOME KIND OF CUTOFF.

16:37.233 --> 16:38.833
SHOULDN'T THERE
BE FOR HALLOWEEN ?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.567
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND YOUR CUT OFFS,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
AND YOUR SHOULDN'T THERE BE
AND SHOULD THERE BE, WHO CARES ?

16:42.633 --> 16:46.367
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO
BE TRICK OR TREATING AT 40 ?

16:46.400 --> 16:47.600
MAY I HAVE
FREE CANDY ?

16:47.633 --> 16:50.067
I'M 40 YEARS OLD,
I WANT FREE CANDY !

16:50.100 --> 16:52.333
YOU KNOW WHAT, NOT EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR RULES, LARRY.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.933
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR OWN SET OF RULES

16:53.967 --> 16:55.433
AND YOU THINK EVERYONE'S
GONNA ADHERE TO THEM,

16:55.467 --> 16:56.833
BUT THEY'RE NOT
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS THEM.

16:56.867 --> 17:00.167
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU HAVE A LONG
DAY OF CLEANING AHEAD OF YOU.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.433
YEAH, I'M GONNA
CLEAN UP BY MYSELF ?

17:01.467 --> 17:03.200
YEAH, YOU ARE GOING TO BE
CLEANING THIS UP BY YOURSELF.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.367
WHO'S FAULT
IS THIS ?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.300
YEAH, WELL, I'M GOING
TO CALL THE POLICE.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.433
SO, THEY HAD
NO COSTUMES ?

17:11.467 --> 17:12.467
RIGHT, THEY HAD
NO COSTUMES

17:12.500 --> 17:14.700
AND FOR SOME REASON
THAT REALLY UPSET HIM.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.167
NOW, YOU'RE SURE
THERE WAS NO COSTUMES.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.633
I MEAN, 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THEY
CAN BE VERY SUBTLE COSTUMES.

17:18.667 --> 17:19.833
NO, THEY WEREN'T
SUBTLE AT ALL.

17:19.867 --> 17:20.967
THERE WERE
NO COSTUMES.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.367
THEY WERE JUST GOING AROUND
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE

17:22.400 --> 17:24.067
TRYING TO GET CANDY,
OKAY ?

17:24.067 --> 17:25.067
MM-HMM.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.900
IS IT POSSIBLE TO
FIND THESE GIRLS

17:26.933 --> 17:29.600
AND MAYBE TALK TO
THEIR PARENTS, OR...

17:29.633 --> 17:33.133
WELL, BY YOUR DESCRIPTIONS,
DARK HAIR, 20 YEARS OLD,

17:33.167 --> 17:35.067
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S 10,000 KIDS

17:35.100 --> 17:36.433
WHO COULD FIT
THAT DESCRIPTION.

17:36.467 --> 17:39.833
THEY WERE SORT OF ELVIRISH,
SHE LOOKED LIKE ELVIRA.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.267
SHE WAS KIND OF IN A LITTLE
BIT OF A COSTUME THERE, THEN ?

17:42.300 --> 17:43.867
WITH THE ELVIRA THING.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.633
NO, THAT WASN'T
A COSTUME.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.067
I'M JUST USING ELVIRA TO
DESCRIBE HER, THAT'S ALL.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.067
IT'S JUST A WAY,
IT'S A SHORT HAND.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.533
THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR,
THEY SAID "TRICK OR TREAT" ?

17:51.567 --> 17:52.767
YEAH, THEY SAID
"TRICK OR TREAT".

17:52.800 --> 17:55.133
AND YOU HAD TREATS ?

17:55.167 --> 17:56.933
I WAS GIVING OUT
CANDY ALL NIGHT.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.267
BUT I DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE THEM CANDY.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.400
THEY DON'T DESERVE CANDY
AND I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.767
BALD ASSHOLE ?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.067
THAT'S A HATE CRIME.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.167
WE'RE A SET,
WE'RE A GROUP.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.333
YOU CAN'T CALL US
BALD ASSHOLES.

18:06.367 --> 18:08.833
WHAT IF WE WERE GAY,
THEN WE'D BE GAY ASSHOLES ?

18:08.867 --> 18:10.067
THAT'S A HATE CRIME.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.833
BUT IT SAYS
"BALD ASSHOLE".

18:12.867 --> 18:16.767
OKAY, BUT WE CONSIDER OURSELVES
A GROUP OF PEOPLE.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.800
SIR, I'M BALD,
I'M NOT OFFENDED.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.633
WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
OFFICER BURT, YOU ARE NOT BALD.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.633
OKAY, YOU HAVE CHOSEN
TO SHAVE YOUR HAIR,

18:23.667 --> 18:25.767
THAT'S A LOOK THAT YOU'RE
CULTIVATING TO BE FASHIONABLE,

18:25.800 --> 18:28.167
AND WE DON'T REALLY CONSIDER
YOU PART OF THE BALD COMMUNITY,

18:28.200 --> 18:29.633
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.

18:31.267 --> 18:32.500
DID THEY THREATEN
YOU IN ANY WAY,

18:32.533 --> 18:34.467
DID YOU SEE WEAPONS
OF ANY KIND, UH ?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.633
NO, NO,
THERE WAS NO THREAT,

18:36.667 --> 18:38.067
EXCEPT FOR
THE TRICK THREAT.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.400
WHAT'S THE TRICK THREAT ?

18:39.433 --> 18:40.767
WELL, THE TRICK OR TREAT.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.833
NO TREAT...

18:41.867 --> 18:42.933
TRICK.

18:42.967 --> 18:44.267
IT'S A THREAT.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.733
HOW FAR CAN YOU
TAKE THESE TRICKS ?

18:45.767 --> 18:46.767
IF IT WAS ANY
OTHER NIGHT, SIR.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.067
TRICK OR TREAT,
BANG, BANG.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.467
BUT IT'S
TRICK OR TREAT.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.267
WE CUT THE KIDS A LITTLE
SLACK ON HALLOWEEN.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.400
THERE'S KIND OF A SOCIAL
CONTRACT THAT YOU ENTER

18:54.433 --> 18:55.967
WHEN YOU
OPEN THAT DOOR.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.067
THEY SAY,
"TRICK OR TREAT",

18:58.100 --> 19:00.433
I WOULD ADVISE YOU,
GIVE THE TREAT.

19:00.467 --> 19:03.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE THEM
THE CANDY NEXT TIME, LARRY ?

19:03.367 --> 19:06.667
I WILL NOT
BE INTIMIDATED.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.433
EVEN ON HALLOWEEN.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.600
ARE YOU
PLAYING GOLF ?

19:25.633 --> 19:27.667
TODAY, NO,
I PLAYED YESTERDAY.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.100
WELL, THEN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DRESSED LIKE THAT ?

19:30.133 --> 19:32.833
I LIKE THE OUTFIT.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.167
I LIKE THE WAY
IT LOOKS.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.233
YEAH, BUT IT'S
A GOLF OUTFIT.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.333
IT'S SORT OF,
YOU KNOW.

19:36.367 --> 19:37.633
WELL, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE JUST GOLF.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.133
WHY CAN'T YOU WALK AROUND
LIKE THIS, IT'S A SHIRT.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.200
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

19:40.233 --> 19:41.533
THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE TELL ME.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.700
WELL, PEOPLE ARE RIGHT.

19:43.733 --> 19:45.167
WANT TO PLAY
TOMORROW ?

19:45.200 --> 19:47.500
I ACTUALLY CAN'T.

19:47.533 --> 19:50.500
IT'S, UH,
IT'S CHERYL'S BIRTHDAY.

19:50.533 --> 19:51.867
SO...

19:51.900 --> 19:53.500
WHY CAN'T YOU ?

19:53.533 --> 19:56.833
DON'T I HAVE TO SPEND HER
BIRTHDAY WITH HER OR SOMETHING ?

19:56.867 --> 19:57.967
EARLY IN THE MORNING,
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ?

19:58.067 --> 19:59.067
IS SHE A BABY ?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.733
HOW OLD IS SHE, LIKE,
FIVE, SIX YEARS OLD ?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.133
WELL...

20:02.167 --> 20:04.433
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, YEAH.

20:04.467 --> 20:05.800
YOU'RE TAKING HER
OUT TO DINNER, RIGHT ?

20:05.833 --> 20:07.100
YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT,
I HAVE TO BE CHAINED TO HER

20:07.133 --> 20:09.767
THE WHOLE DAY, YEAH, WHY,
WHY CAN'T WE PLAY GOLF ?

20:09.800 --> 20:10.800
I'LL COME BY
IN THE MORNING,

20:10.833 --> 20:11.967
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THE HOUSE YET ANYHOW.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.267
OKAY, GREAT,
YOU'RE ON FOR TOMORROW.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.400
IT'S NOT
A RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY,

20:15.433 --> 20:16.600
NO !

20:16.633 --> 20:20.333
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS JASON ALEXANDER THING.

20:20.367 --> 20:22.300
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

20:22.333 --> 20:24.567
I'M DONE WITH IT.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.567
IT'S OVER.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.167
HE DIDN'T WANT TO
DRIVE TO YOUR OFFICE,

20:27.200 --> 20:28.533
SO, THE WHOLE
THING'S OFF ?

20:28.567 --> 20:30.833
I WENT TO HIS OFFICE TWICE,
HE NEVER CAME TO MINE.

20:30.867 --> 20:34.333
THIS IS JUST, YOU KNOW,
EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE,

20:34.367 --> 20:35.733
THIS IS
COMPLETELY FUCKED.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.967
IT'S TOO BAD,
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.100
YOU KNOW, UH,
I HEARD THAT

20:42.133 --> 20:44.200
JULIA IS LOOKING
FOR A PROJECT.

20:44.233 --> 20:46.667
AND IF YOU ASK ME,

20:46.700 --> 20:49.633
YOU COULD DO THE EXACT
SAME PROJECT WITH HER.

20:49.667 --> 20:53.367
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY...

20:55.067 --> 20:56.200
IT COULD REALLY
WORK WITH HER.

20:56.233 --> 20:57.633
IT COULD
WORK WITH HER.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.067
I MEAN, SHE DOES HAVE THE EXACT
SAME PROBLEM WITH ELAINE.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.067
PEOPLE ALWAYS SEE HER AS ELAINE,
THEY JUST WANT HER TO DO ELAINE.

21:03.067 --> 21:05.067
ALL I GOT TO DO,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.867
AND I KNOW THAT SHE'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR A SHOW.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.567
I'M GONNA
CALL JULIA.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.667
GREAT.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.433
LARRY.

21:20.467 --> 21:22.300
GOT TO QUIT MEETING
LIKE THIS, HUH ?

21:25.333 --> 21:26.700
SO, UH, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING ?

21:26.733 --> 21:27.800
OH, UM...

21:27.833 --> 21:28.967
HOW'S THE GOLF ?

21:29.067 --> 21:30.400
NO, I DIDN'T
PLAY GOLF.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.800
I DON'T PLAY GOLF ANYMORE,
I DON'T PLAY GOLF ANYMORE.

21:31.833 --> 21:32.900
AH, LOOK AT
THAT SHIRT.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.333
I'M JUST WEARING THE SHIRT,
I LIKE THE SHIRT.

21:34.367 --> 21:36.067
LARRY, NOBODY WOULD
WEAR A SHIRT LIKE THAT

21:36.067 --> 21:37.467
UNLESS THEY
WERE GONNA GOLF.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.500
I LIKE THE SHIRT,

21:38.533 --> 21:40.400
I GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS
ON THIS OUTFIT.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.700
FINE, OKAY, IF THAT'S
THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE,

21:41.733 --> 21:42.800
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.067
NO, IT'S NOT THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.567
I JUST, I LIKE
THE CLOTHES.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.533
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST WEAR
THEM ON THE GOLF COURSE.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.067
OH, YOU'RE SICK.

21:49.067 --> 21:51.067
YOU CAN WEAR CLOTHES, THAT,
THESE ARE CLOTHES, SO ?

21:51.067 --> 21:52.433
STOP IT !

22:02.533 --> 22:04.200
( knocking )

22:05.133 --> 22:06.867
SHELLEY ?

22:07.533 --> 22:08.867
SHELLEY ?

22:13.067 --> 22:14.433
SHELLEY ?

22:19.067 --> 22:20.433
SHELLEY ?

22:24.600 --> 22:27.300
SHELLEY'S NOT HERE.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.467
OH, HEY CLIFF.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.533
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

22:29.567 --> 22:32.100
I NEED MY, UH...

22:32.133 --> 22:34.067
THE BRACELET
THAT SHE MADE FOR ME.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.067
OH, YEAH,
THE BRACELET.

22:36.067 --> 22:38.500
YEAH, IT'S MY WIFE'S
BIRTHDAY TOMORROW, SO...

22:38.533 --> 22:40.067
RIGHT, RIGHT, YEAH,
YOUR WIFE'S BIRTHDAY, YEAH.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.867
FORGET THE BRACELET,
LARRY.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.800
THERE ISN'T GOING
TO BE ANY BRACELET.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.867
NO BRACELET, I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.867
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

22:46.900 --> 22:47.900
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.067
YOU THINK I DON'T
HAVE EYES, HUH, HUH ?

22:50.100 --> 22:51.967
I'M NOT BLIND,
GET IT STRAIGHT,
ALRIGHT ?

22:52.067 --> 22:53.067
MY EYES WORK.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.100
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

22:54.133 --> 22:55.133
WHAT AM I
TALKING ABOUT ?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.200
YEAH, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

22:56.233 --> 22:57.400
WHAT AM I
TALKING ABOUT ?

22:57.433 --> 22:59.800
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE
KNEE GAME WITH SHELLEY,

22:59.833 --> 23:01.167
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE ARM OVER THE NECK.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.200
YOU'RE BUSTED.

23:02.233 --> 23:03.700
OH, YEAH,
I'M BUSTED.

23:03.733 --> 23:06.867
SHE TOLD ME IN THE RESTAURANT
YOU PROPOSITIONED HER OUTRIGHT.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.467
I WAS JOKING AROUND
AT THE TABLE, OKAY ?

23:09.500 --> 23:11.467
AND SHE PROBABLY
TOOK ME SERIOUSLY.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.533
OH, SHE DID TAKE
IT SERIOUSLY,

23:12.567 --> 23:13.867
I'M TAKING IT
SERIOUSLY TOO, LARRY.

23:13.900 --> 23:16.433
I WAS JOKING AROUND,
'CAUSE YOU GUYS WERE TALKING,

23:16.467 --> 23:18.233
AND I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF
YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION,

23:18.267 --> 23:19.800
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR ME SAY THAT.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.667
SO, THAT'S HOW
FRIENDS JOKE AROUND ?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.533
ONE FRIEND JOKES WITH
THE OTHER FRIEND.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.633
LET ME ASK HIS WIFE
TO SCREW ME !

23:25.667 --> 23:27.433
THAT'S HOW
YOU JOKE AROUND.

23:27.467 --> 23:28.833
WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND,
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING ?

23:28.867 --> 23:29.867
WHAT ?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.200
THOSE ARE
GOLF CLOTHES !

23:31.233 --> 23:32.300
I DIDN'T GOLF TODAY.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.133
YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T GOLFING.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.133
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
WEARING THOSE CLOTHES ?

23:35.167 --> 23:37.167
BECAUSE I LIKE
THE WAY THEY LOOK.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.333
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WEARING THEM ?

23:39.367 --> 23:40.433
THEY LOOK GOOD, PEOPLE
COMPLIMENTED ME ON THEM.

23:40.467 --> 23:41.933
THEY DON'T
LOOK GOOD.

23:41.967 --> 23:45.067
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR, LARRY,
I CAN SEE, YOU'RE A LIAR, MAN.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.100
OH, I'M A LIAR.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.400
YOU'RE A 2-FACED
BACK-STABBING LIAR.

23:48.433 --> 23:50.133
I'M JUST REALIZING
THIS NOW.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.067
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S ALL COMING CLEAR.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.700
YOU'RE A LIAR.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.967
HOW DOES THAT FEEL ?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.567
OKAY, I'M THE GUY WHO GOES
AROUND TELLING PEOPLE

23:57.600 --> 23:59.500
THAT MY GRANDFATHER

23:59.533 --> 24:01.100
INVENTED
THE COBB SALAD !

24:01.133 --> 24:02.167
THAT'S TRUE.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.500
THAT'S ME
WHO DOES THAT ?

24:03.533 --> 24:04.533
THAT'S TRUE.

24:04.567 --> 24:06.167
THE COBB SALAD,
MY FRIEND,

24:06.200 --> 24:09.267
WAS INVENTED IN 1937

24:09.300 --> 24:12.800

24:23.933 --> 24:26.100
IT WAS INVENTED
IN 1937,

24:26.133 --> 24:29.067
BY BOB COBB IN THE BROWN
DERBY RESTAURANT.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.600
OH, WHAT'S

24:30.633 --> 24:32.600

24:36.067 --> 24:38.433
OH, MY GOD, I GOT

24:38.467 --> 24:40.667
OH, GOD, THIS PARTY'S

24:44.967 --> 24:46.133
HEY, ELVIRA.

24:46.167 --> 24:47.167

24:47.200 --> 24:48.600

24:48.633 --> 24:51.067
HEY, THAT'S SOME LANGUAGE FOR
A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL, MY GOD.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.733

24:52.767 --> 24:54.733
OH, VERY IMPRESSIVE, YES.

24:54.767 --> 24:55.800
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD
TIME LAST NIGHT ?

24:55.833 --> 24:56.800
MM-HMM.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.100

24:58.133 --> 24:59.100
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS,
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO THEM ?

24:59.133 --> 25:00.167
THEY'RE NOT HOME.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.167
THEY'RE NOT HOME ?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.167
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.167
OH, REALLY.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.167
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH ANYTHING ?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.433
I SUSPECT THEY ARE,

25:05.467 --> 25:06.500
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T
BE OUT HERE SMOKING.

25:06.533 --> 25:07.533
NO, I HAVE RESPECT
FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.600
OH, DO YOU,
YEAH, I'LL BET YOU DO.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.067
LARRY DAVID.

25:11.100 --> 25:14.300
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
OUR JEWISH HOME ?

25:14.333 --> 25:17.467
WELL, WELL, NOW IT ALL
MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

25:17.500 --> 25:18.467
WHAT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE ?

25:18.500 --> 25:19.467
THIS IS YOUR DAUGHTER,
ISN'T IT ?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.467
YES, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.800
HI, DADDY.

25:21.833 --> 25:24.233
WELL, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
INTERESTED IN KNOWING THAT

25:24.267 --> 25:26.800
YOUR DAUGHTER, LAST NIGHT,
THREW EGGS AT MY HOUSE,

25:26.833 --> 25:28.700
PAPERED MY HOUSE
WITH TOILET PAPER,

25:28.733 --> 25:30.300
WROTE "BALD ASSHOLE"
ON MY DOOR...

25:30.333 --> 25:31.567
BULLSHIT.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.067
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GIVE
HER CANDY ON HALLOWEEN.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.433
NO, SHE SAID NO.

25:35.467 --> 25:36.433
SHE'S A LIAR.

25:36.467 --> 25:37.433
NO, SHE'S NOT A LIAR.

25:37.467 --> 25:39.267
NO, YOU'RE A LIAR.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.367
YOU'RE A LIAR AS
A HUMAN BEING.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.400
OH, HERE WE GO.

25:41.433 --> 25:43.300
I HEARD ABOUT
CLIFF AND HIS WIFE.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.967
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT YOU TRYING
TO SLEEP AROUND WITH HER.

25:46.067 --> 25:47.067
YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO YOUR PEOPLE.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.400
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.367
OH, YOU KNOW,
THE PSYCHO METER'S
BACK ON NOW.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.800
POSTMAN, POSTMAN,
COME HERE.

25:52.833 --> 25:56.900
TELL THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHAT
A SHONDA LARRY DAVID IS.

25:56.933 --> 25:58.367
HA HA !

26:00.133 --> 26:02.167
BUT YOU'RE A LOUSY
HUMAN BEING.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.067
HE SCREWS THE WIFE OF
A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR.

26:06.533 --> 26:07.867
A SHONDA.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.933
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE GIVEN ME SOME CANDY.

26:09.967 --> 26:12.300
YOU'RE A LOUSY JEW !

26:16.933 --> 26:19.133
* ( music )

26:41.433 --> 26:43.067
OH, MY.

26:44.533 --> 26:45.733
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

26:45.767 --> 26:49.067
THANK YOU,
OH, MY GOD.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.767
LARRY.

27:12.133 --> 27:13.100

27:13.133 --> 27:14.100
WHAT'S GOING ON,
LARRY ?

27:14.133 --> 27:16.067
GO OUTSIDE,
WAIT OUTSIDE.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.267
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.267
I FORGOT.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.667
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO PLAY GOLF.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.767
WELL, YOU CAN'T
PLAY GOLF TODAY.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.867
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.233
I MADE A PLAN.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.167
YOU NEED TO GET
RID OF HIM.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.600
OH, OKAY, ALRIGHT.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.500
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE TEE IN 10 MINUTES.

27:31.533 --> 27:32.800
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

27:32.833 --> 27:34.067
DON'T YOU KNOCK
BEFORE YOU COME IN ?

27:34.067 --> 27:35.700
I DID KNOCK, I'VE BEEN
KNOCKING FOR A WHILE.

27:35.733 --> 27:37.333
OKAY, SHH, QUIET.

27:37.367 --> 27:38.567
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.067
THAT WOMAN DIDN'T GIVE ME
THE BRACELET, SO, I HAVE TO,

27:40.067 --> 27:42.400
I HAD TO, YOU KNOW,
COME UP WITH SOMETHING,

27:42.433 --> 27:43.467
AND I CAME UP
WITH THIS.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.367
NO, WELL,
THAT'S NICE.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.433
I CAN'T DO IT.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.867
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I WENT THROUGH ?

27:49.900 --> 27:51.400
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA...

27:51.433 --> 27:53.100
WHAT IT TAKES FOR ME
TO TAKE A DAY OFF ?

27:53.133 --> 27:54.500
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ?

27:56.167 --> 27:58.133
WHAT, C'MON.

27:58.167 --> 28:00.333
NO, LET ME, MAYBE
I CAN PLAY NINE HOLE.

28:00.367 --> 28:01.733
CAN I PLAY NINE ?

28:01.767 --> 28:03.267
NO, C'MON.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.067
I CAN'T DO IT.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.567
C'MON, JUST GO.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.833
