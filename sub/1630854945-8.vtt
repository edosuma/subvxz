- What do you want, Xavier?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.495
- Come on, Dad.
There is no way

13:48.561 --> 13:51.198
that Mr. South had anything to
do with Maddie's disappearance.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.967
I--I was with him
the day that she went missing.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.269
I--I've told you this
a million times.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.370
- Well, I'm busy.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.880
- I also know he couldn't
have been in those houses.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.848
The person that I saw
in the house

14:08.916 --> 14:10.717
where you found the crowbar
jumped out of a window.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.385
Mr. South can barely
make it up the steps

14:12.452 --> 14:13.987
without a knee brace.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.891
What?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.494
- So now you're gonna
come down here

14:21.561 --> 14:23.163
and admit to me...

14:23.230 --> 14:25.632
- [scoffs]
- That you were there?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.268
That's a bold move, Xavier,

14:28.335 --> 14:31.972
you know, coming down here
to my office tell me that.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.406
I should be
arresting you right now.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.608
- Yeah. Yeah, Dad,
maybe you should arrest me.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.011
Or crazy idea,
do your fucking job

14:38.078 --> 14:39.846
and arrest the actual criminal!

14:39.913 --> 14:41.614
- That's enough.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.784
[tense music]

14:44.851 --> 14:46.819
I got work to do.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.390
Go home, Xavier.

14:50.457 --> 14:57.397
* *

15:18.151 --> 15:19.452
- Hey.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.887
- Hey.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.224
- Things were weird earlier.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.093
- I don't know, I think
we lapped weird decades ago.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.761
- Okay, what is
going on with you?

15:28.828 --> 15:30.697
Why aren't you asking
more questions?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.299
Dawn crossed over.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.700
- Good for her.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.268
That doesn't help me.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.637
- Yeah, okay.
But what if it could?

15:37.704 --> 15:39.272
We were there.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.042
Dawn found something yesterday
in the séance, right?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.643
She must have
unlocked something--

15:43.710 --> 15:44.844
something huge.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.113
- We never saw her cross over.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.048
- Yeah, but we felt it.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.482
Right?
I mean, she was able

15:49.549 --> 15:51.784
to conjure her memories,
and she made it out.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.421
- Can't you just slow down
on all of this?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.723
- See, th-this is what
I'm talking about.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.258
Where is this coming from?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.360
You--you were in some big rush
to cross over,

16:00.427 --> 16:02.695
and--and now
you wanna slow down.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.431
- You're out of your depth,
Charley.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.633
Give it up.
- You can't just shut me out.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.601
- Just give it up, Charley!

16:08.668 --> 16:11.704
- Rhonda, you can talk to me.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.705
We're friends.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.041
- Why?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
Because we're
stuck here together?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.478
Get a fucking clue, kid.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.313
[tense music]

16:20.380 --> 16:21.881
- Fine.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.985
[door opens]

16:26.053 --> 16:33.193
* *

16:39.232 --> 16:40.400
- [sighs]

16:49.076 --> 16:50.077
- Are we early?

16:50.143 --> 16:51.444
There's no one here.
- Yeah.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.845
I just thought we could
take a couple minutes,

16:52.912 --> 16:54.814
think over what you wanna say.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.616
- No, I--I don't wanna
give a speech.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.051
- Oh, it's nothing big.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.987
Just figured you might
wanna say a few words.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.956
We can just write
a few things down.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.060
That way you don't have
to think on the fly.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.462
Here.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.280
- Which one was hers?

17:28.848 --> 17:31.118
Where did Maddie sit?

17:47.033 --> 17:48.935
- All right.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.571
So, uh, guess we should start.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.574
[tense music]

17:54.641 --> 17:56.008
* *

17:56.075 --> 17:58.111
- There. This is the address.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.554
Wait, wasn't the last break-in
one block over?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.122
- Yeah.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.658
- Hey, is that door open?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.094
- Maybe the cops
already came by.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.464
- It looks like
it's been broken into.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.031
- Should we go in?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.867
- Uh, yeah,
'cause that's worked

18:20.933 --> 18:23.002
so well for you in the past.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.204
- Good point.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.340
- Look, I say we just sit
and watch, wait.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.841
If there's movement
or something weird,

18:28.908 --> 18:30.643
then we got a closer look.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.644
You know, like a stakeout.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.912
- Awesome.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.647
Few hours with you guys
cramped in a car

18:34.714 --> 18:37.184
is exactly how I wanted
to spend my Wednesday night.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.123
- Are you finding anything?

18:44.191 --> 18:46.326
- Dude, this thing was old
when I went here.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.295
- [sighs]
Dawn found something yesterday

18:48.361 --> 18:49.529
when she looked into her past,

18:49.596 --> 18:51.764
and Janet must have
done the same.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.567
So--so maybe if we look
into their pasts too,

18:54.634 --> 18:58.638
we can find something
that could explain all of this.

18:58.705 --> 18:59.639
What year are you on?

18:59.706 --> 19:00.873
- Uh, 1959.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.175
I'm trying to move backwards,

19:02.242 --> 19:04.110
but I am not seeing
Janet's name anywhere.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.945
She died in 1960, right?

19:06.012 --> 19:07.647
- Yeah.
No, nothing of much interest

19:07.714 --> 19:09.449
in Dawn's student file either.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.617
You know, I--

19:10.683 --> 19:15.087
I know we weren't
super close, but...

19:15.154 --> 19:17.424
I feel kind of awful

19:17.490 --> 19:19.292
that we didn't get
to say goodbye to her.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.394
[soft dramatic music]

19:21.461 --> 19:24.264
- I don't want it
to happen that way for me.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.535
I didn't get a goodbye
last time.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.105
I do not want
to just disappear.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.712
- Me either.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.518
Even more reason for us
to understand what is going on.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.355
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.822
Whoa, wait.
This is weird.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.823
- What? What is?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.992
- Uh, okay.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.061
"Split River High School
has been chosen

19:55.127 --> 19:56.863
"for a national pilot program

19:56.929 --> 19:58.431
"to protect students
and teachers

19:58.498 --> 20:00.166
from the threat
of a nuclear strike."

20:00.233 --> 20:02.235
- What?
- Uh, "A fallout shelter will

20:02.302 --> 20:04.170
"be built below the east wing
of the school,

20:04.237 --> 20:06.339
"the same location
where fire destroyed

20:06.406 --> 20:10.209
the former chemistry lab
on January 14th, 1958."

20:10.277 --> 20:11.478
- Wait, 1958.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.212
That must be Mr. Martin's fire.
- Yep.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.213
- Does--does it mention him?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.048
- I don't see--oh, yes.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.184
Okay, uh,
"Authorities determined

20:18.251 --> 20:20.186
"the fire was accidental.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.054
"Two people were killed
in the fire

20:22.121 --> 20:24.924
"that overtook the lab during
a routine chemistry lesson.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.193
"Beloved chemistry teacher,
Mr. Everett Martin,

20:27.260 --> 20:28.361
was one of the deceased--"
- Wait, two people?

20:28.428 --> 20:30.797
He said he was
the only casualty.

20:30.863 --> 20:34.200
- Um, "One student was also
killed in the fire..."

20:34.267 --> 20:35.868
um, "sophomore--"

20:35.935 --> 20:37.904
[tense music]

20:37.970 --> 20:39.606
- What? What--what's wrong?

20:39.672 --> 20:43.943
* *

20:44.010 --> 20:47.179
- Janet Hamilton.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.422
Why did they both lie to us?

21:03.296 --> 21:06.566
- Maybe we start off
with what this award

21:06.633 --> 21:08.601
would have meant to Maddie.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.037
- Not much.
She always thought

21:11.103 --> 21:13.172
this kind of thing was silly.
[chuckles]

21:13.239 --> 21:14.607
- Well, what do you think
she would say

21:14.674 --> 21:16.643
if she got the award?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.512
- She would say,
"What's the point

21:19.579 --> 21:20.780
if there's not a cash prize?"

21:20.847 --> 21:22.682
- Don't let her talk her way
out of this.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.151
Ask her what she remembers
about that last day.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.920
- Sandra, what do you remember
about that day

21:27.987 --> 21:30.757
when you came to school
looking for Maddie?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.125
- Why are you asking
about that?

21:33.192 --> 21:34.894
- For the speech.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.530
I thought
that if you remembered

21:37.597 --> 21:39.466
something meaningful...

21:39.532 --> 21:41.468
- She's gonna try to bail.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.202
- I shouldn't do this.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.605
You know what?
You can accept the award

21:45.672 --> 21:47.540
and bring it by the house
or keep it.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.808
I honestly don't care.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.510
- I didn't mean to upset you.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.945
- Really?
Could've fooled me.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.647
- No, she can't just leave.
Ask her about the necklace.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.516
- I--I shouldn't be here.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.784
- Simon, ask her
about the necklace.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.152
- Why do you have
Maddie's necklace?

22:00.219 --> 22:03.456
[tense music]

22:03.523 --> 22:08.895
* *

22:08.961 --> 22:11.398
I know you told the cops
that you came to school

22:11.464 --> 22:13.332
the day Maddie went missing,
which I know is true.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.701
I saw your car.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.569
But you said
you didn't see Maddie.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.337
I know that's a lie,

22:18.405 --> 22:23.510
because she was wearing this
when she left study hall.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.211
Why'd come to school
that day anyway?

22:25.277 --> 22:27.647
Maddie told me, she said
that you had to go away

22:27.714 --> 22:30.149
in some program.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.651
Why come back?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.186
- Simon.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.390
- So that's why you were
at the house today.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.767
- Why do you have it?

22:47.834 --> 22:54.974
* *

23:00.547 --> 23:03.450
- [breathing shakily]

23:16.262 --> 23:17.730
- I remember.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.031
- Mads.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.808
[suspenseful music]

23:28.875 --> 23:36.015
* *

23:45.758 --> 23:47.894
- Hi, sweetie.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.332
- I found her
in the hallway that day.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.433
Why did she lie?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.202
- Why'd you lie
about seeing her?

24:02.709 --> 24:04.811
- Because I--

24:08.380 --> 24:11.718
I was ashamed
of what happened that day.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.453
She found me and then--

24:14.521 --> 24:17.289
- Mom, what are you doing?
Why are you here?

24:17.356 --> 24:19.025
- I don't need to be in rehab.
Okay?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.893
I'm sober. I feel great.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.294
It was a waste of money
for me to be there.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.696
- Mom--
- Listen, I have something

24:23.763 --> 24:25.131
really exciting to tell you.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.633
- Mom, you cannot be here.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.367
- Maddie, stop it.
- Mom, you need to go back,

24:28.434 --> 24:29.602
please.
- All right, just listen to me.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.637
All right?
- Mom, keep your voice down.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.971
Please, come--
- Maddie.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.908
- What are you talking about?
- So this guy

24:35.975 --> 24:37.309
that I was
in treatment with, Alex,

24:37.376 --> 24:39.646
he told me about
these great cabins up north.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.213
And it's this new development,

24:41.280 --> 24:42.749
and they're going
for a really great deal.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.350
And so I bought us one.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.818
- That's impossible.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.186
Okay, we don't have any money.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.856
We had to borrow enough
to put you into rehab.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.423
- We have money.
- [laughs drily]

24:51.490 --> 24:55.327
- Okay, I don't want you
to overreact,

24:55.394 --> 24:59.966
but I used the money that
we put away when your dad died.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.535
But it's for us,
for our future,

25:02.602 --> 25:04.070
so we can start over.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.205
- That was my college fund.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.308
- All right, well,
we'll figure it out.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.810
Okay?
I mean, the schools up there

25:10.877 --> 25:12.178
are not very expensive.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.080
- I'm going to school
in Chicago.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.514
Mom, we--we talked about this.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.883
- All right, well,
why would you wanna do that?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.117
That is very far away.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.119

I'm gonna call him.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.869
- You know, you are being
such a brat right now

25:36.936 --> 25:39.505
and ruining
this beautiful moment.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.707
- Just give me his info.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.974
I'll take care of it.
I'll get it back.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.409
- Well, you know what,
you can't.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.377
I wrote him a cashier's check
this morning.

25:45.444 --> 25:46.879
You know, you just need
to get over it

25:46.946 --> 25:49.281
and realize
that I am the adult here.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.186
- Yeah?

25:56.088 --> 25:58.157
Adults are supposed
to take care of things.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.060
They're supposed to be
responsible for their lives,

26:01.127 --> 26:02.528
for their kids.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.235
No one has taken care of me
since Dad died.

You can't even take care
of yourself, Mom.

That money was for me from Dad.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.716
It wasn't yours to spend.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.385
It's like every day you wake up

26:26.452 --> 26:29.188
and you find a new way
to hurt me.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.257
I have to lie
to my friends every day.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.393

everything is okay.

You know, I spend so much time
and energy just trying

26:37.329 --> 26:40.599
to hide what a mess you are.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.703
You wanna start a new life?

26:43.770 --> 26:46.105
I've spent so long

26:46.172 --> 26:48.941
just trying
to survive this one, Mom.

26:52.144 --> 26:56.282
You wanna take everything
that Dad gave me,

- And so I just left her there.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.434
I went home.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.406
- She's telling the truth.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.445
- I was never trying
to be a bad mom.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.683
I just was.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.391
- Oh. There you guys are.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.627
We're about to get started.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.297
- Go ahead.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.598
I'll catch up in a minute.

29:04.010 --> 29:11.150
* *

29:13.319 --> 29:17.356
- She killed my spirit,

29:17.423 --> 29:19.458
but she didn't murder me.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.262
- Then who did?

29:23.329 --> 29:27.599
* *

29:27.666 --> 29:28.801
- Simon, call me.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.070
Like, as soon
as you get this, call me.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.146
Can you breathe
quieter, please?

29:40.212 --> 29:41.513
- Excuse me?
- You know what?

29:41.580 --> 29:43.115
Don't worry about it.
- Oh, my God.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.383
What is your problem with me?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.484
What, I can't even breathe now?

29:45.551 --> 29:47.019
- Guys.
- Um, for starters,

29:47.086 --> 29:48.220
maybe because you hooked up

29:48.287 --> 29:49.288
with my best friend's
boyfriend.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.722
- Nicole.
- You blackmailed me.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.558
- You blackmailed someone too.
- Great. Great.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.026
See, right there?
That's called common ground.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.461
You both recently
blackmailed someone.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.728
- Oh, like you're so innocent.
- Okay, let's not forget

29:56.795 --> 29:57.930
the part you played
in this whole thing,

29:57.997 --> 29:59.565
thank you very much.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.573
- Look, we are way past
the point of no return here.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.141
Now, all three of us
have screwed up,

30:09.208 --> 30:10.609
and all of us owe
something to Maddie.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.378
Well, this is what we can do
to make it up to her.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.014
No more sitting and waiting.
I'm going in.

30:15.081 --> 30:16.448
- Me too.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.351
- Wait, I'll come too.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.153
- No.
You stay in the car,

30:46.145 --> 30:47.479
- I can relate.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.588
The article said
that this was built

30:56.655 --> 31:00.192
where the old science wing was
after the fire.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.527
Wait.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.762
Looks like someone's
touched this.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.135
- What?
- Well, this looks like--

31:09.201 --> 31:10.269
looks like it's been moved.

Huh, what are these?

this is actually the first time

32:47.966 --> 32:51.170
I've ever been in the gym here.

32:51.237 --> 32:57.709
Um, Maddie didn't really do
too many school activities,

32:57.776 --> 33:01.413
and, um,
whenever she was honored

33:01.480 --> 33:07.219
for her grades
or whatever, uh...

33:07.286 --> 33:09.388
she didn't want me to come.

[tender music]

33:10.856 --> 33:15.461
Um, I--I know, uh,

33:15.527 --> 33:21.733
it seemed like Maddie was
kind of hard to get to know,

33:21.800 --> 33:24.736
and that's probably my fault.

33:30.942 --> 33:33.845
even if you didn't
know her very well,

33:33.912 --> 33:38.817
though maybe
it didn't seem like it,

33:38.884 --> 33:44.956
she cared so, so much

33:45.023 --> 33:46.958
about everything--

33:47.025 --> 33:50.062
her friends,

33:50.129 --> 33:53.665
going to college,

33:53.732 --> 33:55.334
me.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.538
She took care of me...

34:06.278 --> 34:09.281
Probably more than she should
have had to.

34:11.483 --> 34:15.020
So I--I just hope

34:15.087 --> 34:17.989
that all of you here know,

34:18.056 --> 34:22.828
even if you weren't close,

34:22.893 --> 34:25.464
that Maddie would have
stood up for you.

34:25.531 --> 34:31.803

34:31.870 --> 34:36.242
She would have helped you
if you needed it

that kind of person.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.571
Let me see your eyes.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.272
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

41:14.339 --> 41:15.574
- What the fuck?

41:15.641 --> 41:17.375
- Xavier, you hit your head.

41:17.442 --> 41:23.214
* *

41:23.281 --> 41:24.850
- Shit.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.590
- Xavier! Oh, my God.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.091
- No, no, no, no. Hey.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.526
- Xavier! Xavier!
- Hey, hey.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.527
- We have to confront him.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.395
He owes us an explanation.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.930
[door opens]

41:40.465 --> 41:41.567
- What are you guys
doing in here?

41:41.633 --> 41:43.669
I told you to let this go.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.971
- You--you knew about this?

41:46.037 --> 41:47.839
[unsettling music]

41:47.906 --> 41:50.275
You knew that he was
treating us like test subjects

41:50.341 --> 41:51.409
and never really helping us.

41:51.476 --> 41:54.145
You--you knew.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.349
- Look, when Maddie got here
and there was all that stuff

41:58.416 --> 42:00.151
with her friend
on the outside, I--

42:00.218 --> 42:02.487
I just had this feeling.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.489
So I started following him.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.891
[straining]

42:05.957 --> 42:07.092
Thanks.

42:09.527 --> 42:16.467
* *

42:16.534 --> 42:18.203
- Is that...

42:18.269 --> 42:19.337
- Your game ball?

42:19.404 --> 42:21.472
Yep.
- [huffs]

42:21.539 --> 42:23.174
- And my letter to Emilio?

42:23.241 --> 42:24.743
- Sure is.

42:24.810 --> 42:28.546
Right next to my acceptance
letter from Berkeley.

42:28.614 --> 42:29.781
He's been hoarding
all the objects

42:29.848 --> 42:31.016
we had with us when we died.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.718
- I'm gonna throw up.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.254
Are we sure it's him?

42:36.321 --> 42:38.890
- Who else knows
everything about us?

42:38.957 --> 42:41.693
Who have we sat with for
decades baring our souls to?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.228
Who else has some deep,
secret connection

42:43.294 --> 42:44.963
to this stupid fallout shelter?

42:45.030 --> 42:46.732
You know, I've been fooled
by someone like this before,

42:46.798 --> 42:48.499
and I'm not gonna let it happen
to all of us again.

42:48.566 --> 42:49.701
[door slams]

42:51.803 --> 42:53.071
- Jesus.

42:53.138 --> 42:58.810
* *

42:58.877 --> 43:00.511
It's locked.
- Just give it a second.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.047
It'll--it'll reset.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.984
Why didn't it reset?

43:07.285 --> 43:08.219
- I'm checking the hatch.

43:08.286 --> 43:11.189
- [grunting]

43:26.237 --> 43:27.706
- [exhales deeply]

43:50.361 --> 43:51.663
What are you doing here?

43:56.968 --> 43:59.604
- I have to talk to you.

43:59.671 --> 44:03.608
- Okay.
I have to say something first.

44:03.675 --> 44:06.277
When I first got here, I was
asked to write my obituary

44:06.344 --> 44:08.814
to help me move on.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.616
And I was finally able
to write it tonight.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.020
And I wanna read it for you.

44:23.261 --> 44:26.297
[breathes shakily]

44:29.534 --> 44:31.737
I was born.

44:34.439 --> 44:36.808
It was all really hard.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.150
But I had Simon.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.018
[soft dramatic music]

44:47.085 --> 44:49.520
I know why we have
this connection,

44:49.587 --> 44:51.522
why you're the only person
who can see me and hear me.

44:54.259 --> 44:55.260
Because you're the only
person who's never

44:55.326 --> 44:57.095
asked me for anything.

44:57.162 --> 45:00.065
You've never taken
more than you've given.

45:00.131 --> 45:04.202
You're the only person
I can count on,

45:04.269 --> 45:06.437
and you're the only person
I can trust,

45:06.504 --> 45:09.307
and you've only ever
loved me unconditionally.

45:09.374 --> 45:13.779
And I need you to know
that I love you too, Simon,

45:13.845 --> 45:16.748
in a way that's bigger
than high school,

45:16.815 --> 45:19.150
that's bigger than family,

45:19.217 --> 45:21.252
bigger than life or death.

45:22.587 --> 45:25.556
You know, nobody makes it
out of life alive.

45:27.025 --> 45:30.796
But...I'm really grateful

45:30.862 --> 45:35.066
that I didn't have
to make it out of it alone.

45:35.133 --> 45:41.706
* *

45:43.241 --> 45:44.442
Say something.

45:44.509 --> 45:48.046
- [breathing heavily]

45:48.113 --> 45:50.281
I wish that was true.

46:05.730 --> 46:07.365
- What is that?

46:07.432 --> 46:08.766
- That's the person who's been

46:08.834 --> 46:12.270
breaking into houses
across town.

46:12.337 --> 46:15.206
It's who attacked
Xavier tonight.

46:15.273 --> 46:18.176
[unsettling music]

46:18.243 --> 46:20.311
* *

46:20.378 --> 46:23.448
I don't know...

46:23.514 --> 46:25.884
if this is real, Maddie.

46:27.685 --> 46:32.290
Maybe you're just some
fucked up coping mechanism

46:32.357 --> 46:35.093
that I created
to put off the pain--

46:35.160 --> 46:37.295
to put off the pain
of losing you.

46:39.898 --> 46:44.870
But you're alive out there,

46:44.936 --> 46:46.204
and I lost my mind.

46:46.271 --> 46:48.439
- No.

46:48.506 --> 46:50.508
Simon, this is real.
This is me.

46:50.575 --> 46:51.576
Simon.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.743
No, Simon.

46:54.079 --> 46:55.713
Simon, I'm real.

47:00.285 --> 47:02.988
[siren wailing]

47:03.054 --> 47:04.455
[tires screech]

47:04.522 --> 47:07.392
[indistinct radio chatter]

47:07.458 --> 47:09.027
- That's my son in there.
- Why don't you ride with us?

47:09.094 --> 47:10.795
Come in.
- Is it that bad?

47:10.862 --> 47:12.030
Xavier?

47:12.097 --> 47:15.033
[tense music]

47:15.100 --> 47:20.972
* *

47:21.039 --> 47:22.908
[crickets chirping]

47:22.974 --> 47:26.144
- * Pull the plug
in September *

47:26.211 --> 47:28.346
* *

47:28.413 --> 47:31.282
* I don't wanna die in June *

47:31.349 --> 47:32.984
* *

47:33.051 --> 47:36.754
* I'd like to start
planning my funeral *

47:36.821 --> 47:38.056
* *

47:38.123 --> 47:42.928
* I've got work to do *

47:42.994 --> 47:44.795
- Please, Simon.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.965
I know I can't explain
what's going on, Simon,

47:47.032 --> 47:48.733
but I am here, Simon!

47:48.799 --> 47:50.468
You're not crazy!

47:51.903 --> 47:53.304
Simon!

47:53.371 --> 47:56.007
- * Pull the plug,
make it painless *

47:56.074 --> 47:57.775
* *

47:57.842 --> 48:01.179
* I don't want a violent end *

48:01.246 --> 48:02.747
* *

48:02.813 --> 48:06.684
* Don't say that you'll
always love me *

48:06.751 --> 48:10.655
* 'Cause you know
I'd bleed myself dry for you *

48:10.721 --> 48:12.757
* Over and over again *

48:12.823 --> 48:13.959
- [screams]

48:14.025 --> 48:18.263
* *

48:18.329 --> 48:22.033
- Please, somebody help!

48:22.100 --> 48:23.201
Help!
- [gasps]

48:23.268 --> 48:26.037
- [muffled]
Please, somebody help me.

48:26.104 --> 48:28.173
* *

48:28.239 --> 48:29.340
Help!

48:29.407 --> 48:30.775
Please!

48:34.980 --> 48:37.348
Help. Help!

48:47.025 --> 48:48.793
No, I don't want to.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.729
No.

48:56.201 --> 48:59.604
- * I don't get a choice
in the matter *

48:59.670 --> 49:01.206
* Why would I? *

49:01.272 --> 49:04.075
* It's only the death of me *

49:04.142 --> 49:07.012
[muffled chatter]

49:07.078 --> 49:11.716
* Only the death of me *

49:13.784 --> 49:15.453
- Have to find out
exactly what happened.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.355
What did you feel?
You have to tell me.

49:17.422 --> 49:19.057
You have--

49:20.558 --> 49:21.659
Don't move, Janet!

49:21.726 --> 49:23.028
No! No!

49:23.094 --> 49:25.063
- * I don't wanna
die too soon *

49:27.132 --> 49:31.669
* I think there's good
in you somewhere *

49:31.736 --> 49:35.406
* I'll hang on
till the chaos is through *

49:35.473 --> 49:37.142
* *

49:37.208 --> 49:38.143
- Help!

49:38.209 --> 49:40.345
Somebody, please!

49:41.846 --> 49:43.248
- Charley?

49:43.314 --> 49:45.350
I'm here.

49:45.416 --> 49:46.751
- Maddie!

49:48.686 --> 49:49.887
- I'm trying open the door.

49:49.954 --> 49:51.756
- Maddie, the back hatch
is stuck too.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.092
We can't move it.
- Maddie, be careful!

49:54.159 --> 49:56.294
Please, you can't trust him!

49:56.361 --> 49:58.029
- Trust who?

49:58.096 --> 50:01.832
- * I'd like to plan out
my part in this *

50:01.899 --> 50:04.569
* But you're
such a narcissist *

50:04.635 --> 50:08.706
* You'll probably
do it next week *

50:08.773 --> 50:12.243
* I don't get a choice
in the matter *

50:12.310 --> 50:13.711
* Why would I? *

50:13.778 --> 50:16.547
* It's only the death of me *
- [gasps]

50:16.614 --> 50:21.319
* *

50:21.386 --> 50:23.154
- It's 25.

50:27.392 --> 50:29.827
We prefer small bills.

50:33.364 --> 50:36.501
[wind whistling]

50:43.541 --> 50:45.876
- We need a name
for the ticket purchase.

50:45.943 --> 50:47.145
- Janet.

50:47.212 --> 50:48.579
Uh, Maddie.

50:48.646 --> 50:50.148
It's Maddie.

51:00.791 --> 51:03.394
- * Doomsday
is close at hand *

51:03.461 --> 51:07.265
* I booked the marching band *

51:07.332 --> 51:09.600
* To play as you speak *

51:11.502 --> 51:14.071
* I feel like throwing up *

51:14.139 --> 51:20.911
* You sit and stare
like a goddamn machine *

51:20.978 --> 51:24.749
* I'd have liked
to plan out my part in this *

51:24.815 --> 51:28.186
* But you're
such a narcissist *

51:28.253 --> 51:31.589
* That you did it
on Halloween *

51:31.656 --> 51:35.193
* I had no choice
in the matter *

51:35.260 --> 51:36.561
* Why would I? *

51:36.627 --> 51:40.531
* It's only the death of me *
