00:07.966 --> 00:09.759
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.928
Well, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.638
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.433
-You have a right to know.
-<i>The Myth of Polyfidelity.</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:18.518
-Great premise.
-Don't have an abortion.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.146
Can you at least...
think about it?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.565
Why is she here... again?

00:23.648 --> 00:25.734
She was at a meeting.

00:25.817 --> 00:29.154
So why is my spidey sense screaming
that something weird's going down?

00:29.237 --> 00:31.031
No family at all?

00:31.114 --> 00:35.035
No. Well, other than my grandma,
but we haven't talked in years,

00:35.118 --> 00:37.370
-and she is <i>nuts.</i>
-I think we've come up

00:37.454 --> 00:40.707
with the <i>real</i> question
of your thesis.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.709
What's the real question
of my thesis?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.461
"What is wrong with me?"

00:44.544 --> 00:47.589
Fuck you and your latest annoying attempt
at bartender wisdom.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.215
You can't talk to me like that.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.801
-Uh, okay.
-So, however it's gonna be between us,

00:51.885 --> 00:53.261
it is not gonna be like that.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.846
-Yeah, I'm serious.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.222
Wanna meet my dad?

00:56.306 --> 00:58.183
Em, what really matters is,
what do you want?

00:58.266 --> 00:59.517
I want this baby.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.811
And I want my husband and Izzy.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.855
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:03.938 --> 01:06.149
Yellow roses, the official
flower of apology.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.819
Iz, would you please
just hear me out?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.989
-It was just some lost chick.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.548
I'm keeping it.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.885
Hey, Jack?

01:33.968 --> 01:35.386
Hey.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.935
Iz, take a breath, okay?

01:42.769 --> 01:45.271
I mean, lots of people are
cordial with their exes, right?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.565
-Mm, hard pass.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.984
Fool me once, shame on me.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.820
Fool me twice...

01:52.112 --> 01:53.279
blow me.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.575
Iz, Izzy, if you could give me
just five minutes of your time,

01:57.659 --> 01:59.494
possibly with eye contact,

01:59.577 --> 02:02.622
I swear, I'll walk out that door
and you will never see me again,

02:02.705 --> 02:04.582
<i>if</i> that's what you want. I say we hear her out.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.574
You can talk
until I finish this beer.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.203
Thank you. Um...

02:42.287 --> 02:44.706
It's a good beer. Talk fast.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.333
Okay, I, um...

02:48.084 --> 02:48.960
Um...

02:50.503 --> 02:51.462
I just...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.506
Jack, could you possibly
put on some pants?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.425
-It's-- it's a bit distracting.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.595
No. Don't listen to her.
This is your home.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.056
But what if I actually
wanna put on pants?

03:02.140 --> 03:05.184
-Well, then that's fine.
-Okay.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.274
Izzy, I am so, so sorry.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.943
-Boring.
-No, you're right. You're right.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.155
It's lazy just repeating myself
over and over again.

03:21.242 --> 03:24.579
I'm living the lesbian dream
up there, okay?

03:24.662 --> 03:26.080
That's nice.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.333
We've got a 20th-floor view
of the Space Needle.

03:28.416 --> 03:32.003
One call gets us into any restaurant
with 6-months waiting list.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.547
I mean, I am not bragging,
but Kylie and I are

03:34.631 --> 03:36.883
pretty much the Portia and Ellen
of Seattle.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.137
Having any second thoughts
about letting her in?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.432
No, no, no. Guys, that was just
the set up. Here's the payoff.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.519
It was so much easier
than this, than us.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.855
But that doesn't make it real.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.153
I'm in love with the two of you.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.073
Jack, Izzy...

04:02.367 --> 04:05.245
I'm just a girl,
standing in front of a boy,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.997
-and another girl--
-Dear God, make it stop.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.626
Look, if I had a time machine, I would go
back and I would just ask for a beat so

04:11.709 --> 04:14.587
I could get my head around this concept
of us having a baby together, but--

04:14.671 --> 04:17.465
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

04:19.592 --> 04:23.554
Is your ex standing in <i>our</i> home,
blaming us for pushing her?

04:24.472 --> 04:25.848
That's her pitch?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.476
Buh-bye, golden nectar.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.525
Ahh.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.278
That was very brave, Em.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.406
-Thank you.
-I mean, I only heard parts of it

04:41.489 --> 04:43.616
'cause I got super bored
during the braggy bits.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.661
But we really need to get going, so...

04:46.744 --> 04:48.705
-Jack.

04:48.788 --> 04:52.166
Could you please let your ex
That beer went right through me.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.302
So when did you come to this?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.761
When did I come to this?

05:03.845 --> 05:06.347
Or when did I grow the balls
to admit it to myself?

05:06.431 --> 05:09.350
'Cause they're separated
by roughly five months.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.624
I... got the girls fed.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.586
Thank you.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.888
You know, I-I don't wanna get a divorce

05:46.971 --> 05:49.182
and move to Seattle to be a lesbian.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.394
Neither do I.
So we have that in common.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.856
-But...
-Damn your "buts."

05:58.941 --> 06:00.860
This <i>is</i> happening, Dave.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.279
I'm gonna be putting
more time into the magazine,

06:03.362 --> 06:05.198
and we need to come up with a plan.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.283
Okay, now promise
you won't get mad?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.078
Okay...

06:10.161 --> 06:13.456
Okay, now, see the point
of the initial plan

06:13.539 --> 06:16.375
was... Hang on.
Just give me a second, okay?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.837
The point of the initial plan
was for our girls

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
to have at least three years
before they were

06:21.756 --> 06:24.467
living their lives
on someone else's schedule.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.593
-That's true. But--
-Now,

06:25.676 --> 06:28.930
-I made a little bit more money than you.
-Because you have a penis.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.307
I think it was about seniority
more than genitalia.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.727
-It's a little bit of both. Go on.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.521
Right. So, you wanted to stay at home.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.565
-This was a-a mutual decision.
-Yes. That's right.

06:39.649 --> 06:43.653
Now that I've gotten to know
the tiny women that we made,

06:44.987 --> 06:48.950
I am terrified of even
the slightest fuck up

06:49.033 --> 06:53.371
leading them down a path
to becoming asshole mean girls

06:53.454 --> 06:55.748
who post their brunches on Instagram

06:55.832 --> 06:59.502
with the peace sign and the duck lips
and the #blessed.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.963
"#blessed"?
God doesn't care about brunch.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.257
I just saw it in my head.

07:04.632 --> 07:08.553
They <i>are</i> assholes
wearing gigantic sunglasses.

07:08.636 --> 07:12.765
But... but for what it's worth,
they are very pretty, so there's that.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.642
Yeah, this is...

07:15.268 --> 07:18.604
My parents were strict
and very old-fashioned.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.858
But I knew that I mattered more to them
than anything in the world.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.447
I would like our girls
to know that too.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.579
<i>♪ One look ♪</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:36.122
What?

07:36.205 --> 07:39.000
<i>♪ Was all it took ♪</i>

07:39.083 --> 07:40.084
Mm.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.464
Mmm.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
<i>♪ One look ♪</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:49.886
You're an incredible man.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.308
And our girls are gonna have
a hard time finding somebody

07:55.391 --> 07:58.519
because they'll be
measuring everybody to you. And you are the dopest mom.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.111
Yeah.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.655
And they're gonna
know that too.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.450
They're gonna know
all about that, your dopeness.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.910
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.495
I want them to know
about my dopeness,

08:15.578 --> 08:17.705
but I want them to see that
I'm winning at life,

08:17.914 --> 08:19.832
that I'm firing on all cylinders.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.418
And I want them to know that
they can be the dopest moms

08:22.502 --> 08:24.837
and be the dopest women
all at the same time.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.964
And I guess I just... I-I really...

08:27.048 --> 08:29.133
need to show myself that, too.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.816
-No.
-Izzy, come on.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.569
Just so you know,
I am officially way past believing

08:48.653 --> 08:53.241
that Emma's mysterious return
was ever about a sudden business meeting.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.742
What makes you say that?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.662
She was wearing the same yoga pants
and slippers, Sherlock.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.664
Was she? I didn't even notice that.
That's weird.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.791
Come here. Look at me in the eye.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.545
No, that is a random spot
over my shoulder.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.838
There you go!

09:09.215 --> 09:11.092
Did you know that
she wanted back in? Was that what you two were
talking about on campus?

09:13.678 --> 09:17.765
No. I found out the exact
same time you did. I swear.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.898
Okay. Well, now that
you do know, where do you stand?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.443
I'm with you. Okay?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.571
On this and everything else.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.324
Not bad.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.910
So what about you?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.871
It's a lot to digest all at once,
but she seemed--

09:40.955 --> 09:42.331
I could never trust her.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.001
And I would be beyond
disappointed if you could.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.173
I feel you.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
-Yeah.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.721
Yes, I mean, like,
I... heard you,

09:56.804 --> 09:58.973
I acknowledge it,
I understand what you said.

09:59.056 --> 10:03.686
Okay. Way to go out on a limb.
Come on. We're gonna be late.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.028
Done.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.782
Okay, will you please stop that?

10:17.241 --> 10:18.242
Stop what?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.661
Stop not being goofy. Oh. I'm sorry, Neen.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.916
How can I amuse you,
as that's my sole purpose in this life?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.252
I already apologized.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.254
Did you?

10:32.381 --> 10:33.841
Hey, look.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.219
I'm sorry for the way
that I spoke to you.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.350
And I wanna hear you say that...

10:42.433 --> 10:44.852
-I'm your superior.
I'm not...

10:48.272 --> 10:49.190
Oh.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.486
Oh, fuck. Fine. Fuck, fuck.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.073
And you're my...

10:59.408 --> 11:00.576
...superior.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.999
I'm gonna leave before
this gets fun. No.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.126
For the record,

11:10.086 --> 11:13.172
I'm also your
"Mr. Right There in Front of You."

11:16.509 --> 11:17.843
What the fuck is that?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
Like in rom-coms.

11:20.721 --> 11:24.725
The one who's always there
if you just take the time to notice.

11:24.809 --> 11:29.146
Yeah, no, but nice try.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.899
-Well, no. It's... it's true.
-Okay, look, you're a lot of things,

11:31.982 --> 11:34.360
including ginger-ish
and intermittently ruddy,

11:34.443 --> 11:36.904
but you are definitely not my...

11:36.987 --> 11:38.280
Mr. Right There in Front of You.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.865
And here's the beautiful twist -

11:39.949 --> 11:44.703
the more that you deny it, the more that
you're just proving my point.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.871
What...

11:46.497 --> 11:49.083
Was there something you wanted
to... to add to that?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.001
You wanna say something

11:51.585 --> 11:54.088
Cool, then I'm gonna take that
as a tacit agreement.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.424
-Mm.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.342
-Mm.
-Mm.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.637
Huh? Come on.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.097
I've earned it.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.350
Don't leave me hanging. Just...
You just ruined the moment. Ah!

12:09.103 --> 12:11.647
So, Ben, been sober for a year now?

12:11.730 --> 12:12.982
Mm-hmm.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.984
How often do you go to meetings?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.486
Okay, I get it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.655
I'm the one under
the swinging bulb here.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.614
No.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.616
I-I go to at least
three meetings a week.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.660
Lately, I've been going to more.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.579
Why is that?

12:26.662 --> 12:29.582
Well, it's been
an especially emotional time.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.378
What made you finally
stop drinking?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.798
Uh, well, I came really close
to drowning in my own vomit.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.720
Yeah, and, uh, when I...
when I finally, uh,

12:42.803 --> 12:45.514
when I finally dragged myself
up off the linoleum,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.892
I looked in the mirror
and I realized that I didn't have

12:47.975 --> 12:49.810
a single reason left to stay alive.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.397
So I decided to find one.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.319
My turn.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.404
So, uh, you're...
you're divorced, yeah?

13:00.488 --> 13:02.281
It's all legal and everything?

13:02.364 --> 13:06.202
There's no, uh, little threads
left between you two?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.454
Is it just me
or is it getting, like,

13:08.537 --> 13:10.915
weirdly possessive
and patriarchal in here?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.917
-Why don't we just, um...
-I can honestly say that...

13:13.000 --> 13:14.293
-Okay.
-...Emma and I are

13:14.376 --> 13:18.631
entirely, completely,
and legally divorced.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.009
Why are you talking like you're
on the wrong side of a Senate hearing?

13:22.092 --> 13:23.135
I'm not.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.224
My daughter.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.351
Oh, uh...

13:30.434 --> 13:33.979
Well...
when Emma and I met...

13:34.063 --> 13:36.565
Oh, hey, remember 10 seconds ago
when my dad clarified

13:36.649 --> 13:38.817
that he was asking about <i>me?</i>

13:38.901 --> 13:41.695
-...I felt the Earth move.
-Okay, not loving this story.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.364
-Honey, hear me out.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.157
And I thought it was
the type of thing that was only gonna happen
once in a lifetime.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.036
-Mm.
-Until I met your daughter.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.248
And I'll be damned
if it didn't happen again.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.875
Except this time, it was more
like an earthquake.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.004
When I opened that hotel room
door for the first time--

13:59.088 --> 14:00.214
E

14:02.091 --> 14:04.843
Yeah, you... you said you fell for Izzy

14:04.927 --> 14:08.681
the first time you saw her,
when you opened the hotel room door?

14:08.764 --> 14:10.349
-Maybe a little clarification on--
-Yeah, no,

14:10.432 --> 14:12.226
I'm realizing now it sounded
like I meant...

14:12.309 --> 14:14.979
I saw her for the first time
when I opened the hotel room door.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.188
-Yeah, no, that's...

14:16.272 --> 14:17.690
-Yeah, no, it did--
-Yeah.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.900
It did sound like that because
that's exactly what you said.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.820
True. Yes, um...

14:22.903 --> 14:24.613
Well, that's because...

14:24.697 --> 14:26.115
-Tell him. Yeah.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.117
I mean, you don't know
every detail, right?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.743
I know them all. But...

14:29.827 --> 14:30.870
Yeah.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.496
Um, I'm at a hotel.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.998
-Mm-hmm.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.875
-Yeah.
-Like I said,

14:35.958 --> 14:39.795
open the door, right, to start
my day, like as one does.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.589
-Mm-hmm.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.340
Lo and behold...

14:45.509 --> 14:47.887
Uh, Izzy is there.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.931
-'Cause... because...
-Izzy was...

14:51.015 --> 14:52.975
...a housekeeper.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.643
-I was... I was a housekeeper.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.228
-Housekeeper, yes.
-Yeah. -You weren't.
-Tell the story, honey.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.939
-Right. Cool.
-Mm-hmm.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.858
Uh, I was a housekeeper...

15:00.941 --> 15:02.902
...for, like, a hot minute
at the Carlyle.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.361
-The hotel.
-The Carlyle.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.030
-Carlyle Hotel. Mm-hmm.
-Mm. Um...

15:06.113 --> 15:08.407
She tells the story better than I do.
So go ahead, honey.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.867
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

15:09.950 --> 15:14.413
Uh, yeah, so, I'm...
I knocked on room 3...

15:14.496 --> 15:17.249
-372.
-...372 to offer--

15:17.333 --> 15:18.375
We'll never forget that.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.045
To offer turndown service. And...

15:21.128 --> 15:22.671
Yeah. She was wearing
a cute little outfit.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.839
-I wasn't. I wasn't.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.049
-No.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.592
-My dad.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.052
I'm joking.
-He's kidding.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.764
No, there was no outfit at... Well,
you were wearing something. Yeah.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.265
And, uh, that's our story.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.725
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, classic...

15:34.808 --> 15:37.353
-Mm-hmm.
-...classic, uh, tale.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.481
Yeah. I mean, we're gonna be

15:40.564 --> 15:42.483
telling that story
for the rest of our lives.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.943
-Can't wait.
-Mm.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.868
One of you cowboys
gonna blink soon,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.037
or should I just wait at the bar?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.164
Thanks for dinner, Jack.
You didn't have to do that.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.916
Your money's no good
in my town.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.419
I've always wanted to say that.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.797
I'm sure it's perfectly good
both here and abroad.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.591
Okay, why don't we just
move on so...

16:07.800 --> 16:10.469
they can mop up
the testosterone, okay?

16:10.552 --> 16:12.012
-Mmm.
Bye.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.473
-You did good.
-Thank you.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.602
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.653
Hey.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.281
<i>Oh! Hey! What's up, girl?</i>

16:32.908 --> 16:37.121
<i>"Hey"? You seriously had</i>
<i>the balls to lead with "Hey"?</i>

16:37.204 --> 16:38.747
I had to tell him.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.083
He had a right to know after
everything we've been through.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.626
<i>Great. You told him.</i>

16:42.710 --> 16:44.378
<i>So why aren't you</i>
<i>at home with me?</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:46.338
<i>Why are you still...</i>

16:46.422 --> 16:47.798
<i>Where are you?</i>

16:48.215 --> 16:50.342
I'm at my friend Carmen's house.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.677
<i>Why?</i>

16:52.428 --> 16:53.887
<i>Emma, what the fuck is going on?</i>

16:54.388 --> 16:56.640
I'm keeping the baby, Kylie.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.437
Please say something.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.606
<i>Say something? Oh, absolutely.</i>

17:05.107 --> 17:06.191
<i>Here it is.</i>

17:06.942 --> 17:08.819
<i>-Fuck you.</i>
-Ky--

17:08.902 --> 17:11.238
-Fuck!

17:11.989 --> 17:14.158
Oh, my God.
-So, hey, hi.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.617
-Hi.
-Here's the thing.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.536
We're working super hard
to not say that word

17:17.619 --> 17:19.413
anywhere near Callie,
who's already devised

17:19.496 --> 17:22.249
an alarming variety of
everyday public application.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.960
-Okay.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.881
It's hard to say
who hates me more, her or Izzy.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.593
I mean, but that's what happens
to horrible people, right?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.970
Everyone hates them,
and they die alone?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.722
You're not horrible, Em.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.849
Thanks, but, I think--

17:38.932 --> 17:41.769
Sharks are scary as shit, right?
But are they really horrible?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.228
Doesn't that imply malicious intent?

17:43.312 --> 17:45.481
Sharks just swim around,
living their lives,

17:45.564 --> 17:48.817
and a bloody trail of horrific carnage
is collateral damage.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.819
They didn't mean to do anything.
It just happened.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.741
Stop it.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.411
I have fucked up
my life so badly.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.748
I know, hon.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.086
I've watched most of it
from my bedroom window.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.837
What should I do?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.632
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I don't know.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.509
All I got is this.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.934
Remember when Jack and I were only weird
because we didn't have kids?

18:22.601 --> 18:23.852
Not really.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.773
Oh!

18:33.529 --> 18:34.905
You did what?

18:34.988 --> 18:36.615
I spoke to your
grandmother's counselor,

18:36.698 --> 18:39.201
and she's been on her meds
and stable for a few years now.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.663
I did not say that you could do that.
I don't give a fuck about her.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.082
But she gives a major fuck about you.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.542
You talked to her?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.794
What happened
to not playing saviour?

18:50.254 --> 18:53.173
I hear you, but what's done is done.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.467
So if you could just
ease it back a little

18:55.551 --> 18:57.386
and let me talk
for one minute, and then,

18:57.469 --> 18:59.680
if you still wanna break
a pool cue over my head,

18:59.763 --> 19:01.890
I will hold perfectly still.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.976
Okay?

19:11.441 --> 19:14.027
She works at PetSmart.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.195
She...

19:15.279 --> 19:17.030
She has a nice little apartment
on Jervis.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.867
And her eyes lit up like a 100-watt bulb
when I said your name.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.078
And look, I don't claim
to know the woman,

19:23.162 --> 19:26.373
but if what her doctor said is true,

19:27.374 --> 19:29.209
maybe she really has changed.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.713
She asked if you'd want
to go for coffee with her.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.089
That's easy: no.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.258
Just no?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.303
The woman
burned my fucking clothes.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.054
What

19:41.138 --> 19:42.973
She was concerned
they might be flammable.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.393
That's not funny.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.146
Okay.
How about I go with you?

19:49.229 --> 19:51.398
Twenty minutes,
just check it out?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.775
Please?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.947
God, fine.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.157
-Yay.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.075
Okay, but you seriously
have to be there.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.827
I will, I promise.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.080
And you have to let me do the acrylics,
any design I want.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.209
Okay.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.173
You're gonna make me
look really stupid, aren't you?

20:16.256 --> 20:17.341
Oh, yeah.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.218
-Ooh.
-Wow.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.762
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
-Wow! Look at that!

20:21.845 --> 20:23.597
Look how it dissolves
to the entertainment section?

20:23.680 --> 20:26.433
-Uh, come in, Alex!

20:28.185 --> 20:29.603
Right. He can only hear your voice.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.647
-Come in, Alex!

20:31.730 --> 20:33.523
Wow. I was joking.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.608
Mm.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.527
Whoa!

20:37.611 --> 20:40.155
I mean, I could tell that was
heavy by the way your pecs...

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
by the sound it made
when it landed.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.285
Hmm! He has a jackknife.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.664
He's a 24-year-old man
who carries a jackknife.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.749
My favourite part
of the job.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.758
-There you go.
-Oh.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.301
And that's for you.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.970
Oh, this is beautiful.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.972
There it is. That's the look.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.849
-Oh, you did good, Alex.
-Mmm.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.185
-You did good, Alex.
-Thanks.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.104
Un-fucking-real!

21:12.980 --> 21:15.691
Mmm.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.568
Damn.
And then he did that.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.242
So is this crush going
both ways now or what?

21:25.325 --> 21:26.743
Oh, I'm just playing,

21:26.827 --> 21:29.871
just pawing him
back and forth a little.

21:29.955 --> 21:30.831
Mm.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.499
What?

21:32.582 --> 21:34.960
Seriously, how much longer
is Rob gonna be gone?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.214
Mm.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.799
Is everything okay?

21:43.343 --> 21:45.012
What? We have to celebrate.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.265
You, me, Emma, who else?

21:50.434 --> 21:52.519
What

21:52.602 --> 21:55.272
Oh, you want strippers.
Yeah, I'm cool with strippers.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.065
I'll just send the boys off
to a sleepover.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.650
Better than strippers.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.110
-Hookers.

22:00.193 --> 22:03.739
Ooh. You're a bad, bad mama,
Carmen Amari.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.332
Just two seconds.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.376
Homework?

22:16.460 --> 22:19.671
It's not actually called that
after high school. It's my thesis.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.715
Yeah, and what's the title again?

22:21.798 --> 22:24.760
-I know you told me, but...
<i>-The Myth of Polyfidelity.</i>

22:30.515 --> 22:31.349
What?

22:31.433 --> 22:33.185
Write what you know?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.272
Is that why you wanted to meet?
'Cause you think you're on to something?

22:38.356 --> 22:40.817
You were never a housekeeper
at the Carlyle.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.569
How would you know?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.239
-Don't need to know.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.741
Oh, my God.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.079
You... you chose the...
the thesis subject of polyamory,

22:52.162 --> 22:53.955
which admittedly, I had to look up.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.458
That is circumstantial at best.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.502
And then, last night,
the two of you were both

22:58.585 --> 23:00.670
lying your asses off
about how you met.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.547
-N-no.
-No, you...

23:02.631 --> 23:05.092
All right, you don't need
to tell me if you don't want to. You were straight with me.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.484
We were together.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.778
Me, Jack, and Emma.

23:26.696 --> 23:30.075
And I loved them both very much,
and they loved me.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.160
And I know this sounds crazy,

23:32.244 --> 23:35.789
but nothing in my life
had ever felt that right.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.749
And I had never been happier,

23:37.833 --> 23:40.710
or... fucking sadder.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.172
But then she left us 'cause that's
how these things always end, so...

23:44.256 --> 23:46.633
At least I got a thesis out of it, right?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.559
That's it?

23:56.017 --> 23:59.104
You're just gonna, like,
nod like this?

23:59.187 --> 24:00.730
Jack did this.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.108
What? No.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.818
Yeah, he made you their plaything.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.028
And then he decided that
he preferred the newer model

24:07.112 --> 24:08.613
and chased his wife away.

24:08.697 --> 24:12.242
That's not even true.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.704
If any one of us started it,
it was me.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.831
I met him, and then I met her,

24:17.914 --> 24:20.959
and then I showed up at their house.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.837
Oh, God. Then this is my fault,
just like the drinking.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.589
I am not you. Okay?

24:25.672 --> 24:28.800
I am a fully formed
free-standing adult. That's bullshit. You are <i>exactly</i>
me before I got straight.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.848
Which means I know
what you need to do.

24:34.931 --> 24:37.017
I swear to God, if you finish
that fucking sentence...

24:37.100 --> 24:38.560
-Just...

24:43.690 --> 24:45.066
What is it?

24:45.150 --> 24:49.905
Apparently, I'm going to an impromptu
soirée in Hawthorne Heights.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.115
Good times.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.744
Where I'm gonna propose to Jack.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.205
Oh, Jesus, Izzy.
Don't do something stupid just--

24:58.288 --> 25:01.541
Honestly, all you have to worry about
is whether or not you can handle it.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.921
If you wanna fucking bail, fucking bail
'cause I know what that looks like.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.677
You're absolutely sure
that Emma left, right?

25:13.261 --> 25:15.138
100%.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.724
That's what Carmen said so...

25:18.141 --> 25:21.811
no reason for me to question it, although
I didn't put a GPS tracker on her, so...

25:21.895 --> 25:24.356
No, not absolutely sure, but...

25:25.315 --> 25:29.110
Yeah.
She's going, going, gone-zo.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.700
What?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.583
Maybe I'm just repressing.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.877
-Yeah.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.879
It means when you, like,
kind of push things down.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.590
-No, I know. I know what it means.
-Yeah.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.468
So what feelings
are you repressing?

25:53.551 --> 25:54.928
All of them.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.596
-Yeah.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.142
Honey, what kind
of seeds are these?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.936
Uh, caraway.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.479
Caraway

26:04.562 --> 26:07.148
-It tastes good.
-Hello, hello. Hello.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.402
Hey, hey. There they are.
Hello.

26:10.485 --> 26:12.112
-Hi.
-There they are!

26:12.362 --> 26:14.197
-Hi, I'm Izzy.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.448
-Hi, I'm Hannah.
-Hi.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.534
-Hi. Jack.
Congrats on the...

26:17.617 --> 26:20.412
Yeah.
-Oh. Thank... thank you.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.415
Hey, sweetie, come on in. Come on.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.960
Ah. There's another
neighbourhood function

26:27.043 --> 26:28.670
hijacked by polygamists.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.922
My God, what is Emma doing--

26:31.006 --> 26:33.591
-Yeah.

26:33.675 --> 26:37.804
So the runaway wife
returns again... and again.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.224
-I was wondering if --

26:43.560 --> 26:47.022
Look, can we do this
somewhere... private?

26:48.648 --> 26:51.026
Mm, better yet.
How about we just take this outside?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.403
And just to be clear,
I am threatening to kick your ass.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.155
-Oh, my God.
-Ow.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.032
-I'm sorry.

26:57.615 --> 27:00.827
-Uh, yes. Thanks.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.163
So can you eat...
can you eat this food that comes...

27:03.246 --> 27:04.247
It's very, uh...

27:05.790 --> 27:08.376
Okay.
You and me in a bathroom,
music playing?

27:11.129 --> 27:12.839
Uh, nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

27:12.922 --> 27:16.468
What part of "stay the fuck away"
do you not understand?

27:17.510 --> 27:19.054
You're angry.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.014
You're angry, which means you care.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.183
I am painfully aware
that I am using rage

27:23.266 --> 27:25.310
to suppress feelings of
heartbreak and abandonment,

27:25.393 --> 27:28.688
okay, but it's working. Oh, uh,
I'm proposing to Jack tonight.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.315
-Izzy. Iz!
-So I'm happy that you--

27:30.398 --> 27:32.233
!
-I'm pregnant.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.073
And I'm keeping it.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.251
Six weeks, so...

28:02.555 --> 28:04.099
He knows, doesn't he? I don't know if I'd say that he...

28:09.437 --> 28:10.730
Fine, he--

28:10.814 --> 28:12.399
Jack!

28:12.982 --> 28:13.858
Oh, God.
