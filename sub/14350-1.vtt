WEBVTT

00:11.574 --> 00:13.199
Captain.

00:13.868 --> 00:15.861
- Got a minute?
- A minute.

00:16.288 --> 00:19.123
It's Spock. You noticed
anything strange about him?

00:19.291 --> 00:21.616
No, nothing in particular. Why?

00:21.794 --> 00:24.997
Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint
without an examination,

00:25.173 --> 00:26.881
but he's become increasingly restive.

00:27.050 --> 00:30.300
If he were not a Vulcan,
I'd almost say "nervous."

00:30.470 --> 00:32.130
For another thing, he's avoiding food.

00:32.305 --> 00:34.879
I've checked and he hasn't
eaten at all in three days.

00:35.059 --> 00:39.057
Well, that just sounds like Mr. Spock
in one of his contemplative phases.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.101
Miss Chapel.

00:44.569 --> 00:47.107
- Dr. McCoy.
- Captain.

00:48.198 --> 00:49.229
What's this?

00:52.286 --> 00:55.490
Vulcan plomeek soup.
And I'll bet you made it too.

00:55.665 --> 00:57.954
You never give up hoping, do you?

00:58.752 --> 01:03.497
Mr. Spock hasn't been eating, Doctor.
And I just happened to notice.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.420
It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.095
- Bones, I'm a busy man.
- Jim,

01:14.269 --> 01:17.389
when I suggested to Spock
it was time for his routine checkup

01:17.564 --> 01:21.977
your logical, unemotional first officer
turned to me and said:

01:22.153 --> 01:25.439
"You will cease to pry
into my personal matters, Doctor,

01:25.615 --> 01:28.071
or I shall certainly break your neck."

01:28.243 --> 01:29.274
Spock said that?

01:29.452 --> 01:31.196
What is this?

01:32.623 --> 01:36.324
Poking. Prying. If I want
anything from you, I'll ask for it.

01:39.630 --> 01:44.127
Captain, I should like to request a
leave of absence. On my home planet.

01:44.302 --> 01:48.680
On our present course, you can divert to
Vulcan with a loss of but 2.8 light-days.

01:49.516 --> 01:52.886
- What the devil is this all about?
- I've made my request, Captain.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.731
All I require from you
is that you answer it, yes or no.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

02:13.168 --> 02:16.335
Space, the final frontier.

02:22.136 --> 02:25.885
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:26.391 --> 02:30.436
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:30.604 --> 02:34.020
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:34.525 --> 02:37.360
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.534
All right, Spock. Let's have it.

03:22.703 --> 03:27.864
It is undignified for a woman to play
servant to a man who is not hers.

03:28.043 --> 03:30.249
I'm more interested
in your request for shore leave.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.828
- In the years that I've known...
- You have my request.

03:33.006 --> 03:35.083
Will you grant it or not?

03:35.926 --> 03:40.755
In all the years I've known you, you've
never asked for leave of any sort.

03:40.932 --> 03:43.423
In fact, you've refused them.
Why now?

03:43.602 --> 03:47.469
Captain, surely I have
enough leave time accumulated.

03:47.648 --> 03:50.483
Agreed. But that isn't the question,
is it?

03:54.906 --> 03:57.397
If there's a problem of some sort,
illness in the family...

03:57.575 --> 03:58.738
No.

03:59.327 --> 04:01.285
Nothing of that nature, Captain.

04:01.455 --> 04:04.207
Then since we're headed for Altair VI,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.664
and since the shore facilities
there are excellent...

04:06.836 --> 04:08.663
No. I must...

04:13.260 --> 04:15.632
I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.

04:26.775 --> 04:29.978
Spock, I'm asking you.

04:30.821 --> 04:32.149
What's wrong?

04:32.948 --> 04:35.618
I need rest.

04:37.203 --> 04:41.071
I'm asking you to accept that answer.

04:47.464 --> 04:48.875
Bridge.

04:49.049 --> 04:51.505
- Helm.
- Yes, Captain?

04:52.887 --> 04:54.298
Alter course to Vulcan.

04:54.472 --> 04:57.592
- Increase speed to warp 4.
- Aye, sir.

05:03.399 --> 05:04.679
Thank you, Captain.

05:07.069 --> 05:11.815
I suppose most of us overlook the fact
that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.

05:16.205 --> 05:18.079
No.

05:24.631 --> 05:26.422
We're not.

05:27.509 --> 05:31.377
Captain's Log, Stardate 3372.7.

05:31.555 --> 05:36.716
On course, on schedule,
bound for Altair VI via Vulcan.

05:36.894 --> 05:39.682
First Officer Spock
seems to be under stress.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.525
He has requested
and been granted shore leave.

05:42.734 --> 05:45.569
Ship's Surgeon McCoy
has him under medical surveillance.

05:45.737 --> 05:49.736
Captain, something's coming in
on the Starfleet channel.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.523
Priority and urgent, sir.

05:51.702 --> 05:54.372
Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant.

05:55.749 --> 05:58.703
Message complete, sir.
Switching over.

05:59.503 --> 06:03.880
To Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise.
From Starfleet, Sector 9.

06:04.049 --> 06:08.344
Inauguration ceremonies Altair VI
have been advanced seven solar days.

06:08.513 --> 06:11.763
You're ordered to alter your flight plan
as filed to accommodate.

06:11.933 --> 06:14.603
By order of Komack,
Admiral, Starfleet Command.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.098
Acknowledge.

06:16.271 --> 06:17.896
Lieutenant Uhura,
acknowledge that message.

06:18.065 --> 06:19.096
Aye aye, sir.

06:19.275 --> 06:22.478
Mr. Chekov, compute course
and speed necessary for compliance.

06:22.653 --> 06:27.115
We'll have to head directly there
at warp 6, sir.

06:27.409 --> 06:29.532
Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan.

06:32.206 --> 06:34.448
Head directly for Altair VI.

06:34.625 --> 06:35.954
Sailor's luck, Mr. Spock.

06:36.127 --> 06:38.167
Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it:

06:38.338 --> 06:41.707
"Any home port the ship makes
will be somebody else's, not mine."

06:41.883 --> 06:45.050
The new President of Altair VI wants
to get himself launched a week early,

06:45.220 --> 06:47.794
so we have to be there a week early.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.762
Don't worry,
I'll see that you get your leave,

06:50.935 --> 06:52.892
as soon as we're finished.

06:54.063 --> 06:57.433
I quite understand, Captain.

07:14.294 --> 07:17.165
- Bridge, Navigation.
- Navigation, Chekov here.

07:17.339 --> 07:20.922
Mr. Chekov, how late will we arrive
for the ceremonies

07:21.093 --> 07:23.667
if we increase speed to maximum
and divert to Vulcan

07:23.847 --> 07:26.089
just long enough to drop off
Mr. Spock?

07:26.266 --> 07:28.009
I do not understand, Captain.

07:28.185 --> 07:30.593
How far behind schedule
will diverting to Vulcan put us?

07:31.105 --> 07:35.103
We're on course for Vulcan, Captain,
as Mr. Spock ordered.

07:36.611 --> 07:39.184
Thank you, Mr. Chekov. Kirk out.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.487
Mr. Spock.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.618
Come with me, please.

08:04.141 --> 08:06.134
Deck 5.

08:08.396 --> 08:11.600
You changed course for Vulcan,
Mr. Spock. Why?

08:11.775 --> 08:13.732
Changed the course?

08:15.279 --> 08:16.524
Do you deny it?

08:16.906 --> 08:19.658
No. By no means, Captain.

08:21.494 --> 08:23.783
It is quite possible.

08:23.955 --> 08:27.787
- Then why did you do it?
- Captain, I accept, on your word...

08:27.959 --> 08:29.454
...that I did it.

08:29.628 --> 08:32.914
But I do not know why,
nor do I remember doing it.

08:35.051 --> 08:36.878
Captain, lock me away.

08:37.053 --> 08:39.378
I do not wish to be seen.

08:39.556 --> 08:44.099
I cannot.
No Vulcan could explain further.

08:45.479 --> 08:47.187
I'm trying to help you, Spock.

08:47.356 --> 08:50.061
Ask me no further questions.
I will not answer.

08:53.947 --> 08:57.648
- I order you to report to the Sickbay.
- Sickbay?

08:58.035 --> 09:00.277
Complete examination.
McCoy's waiting.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.826
Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you.

09:38.830 --> 09:43.042
My orders were
to report to Sickbay, Doctor.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.037
I have done so.

09:45.212 --> 09:47.750
And now I'll go to my quarters.

09:47.923 --> 09:50.296
My orders were to give you
a thorough physical.

09:50.468 --> 09:51.499
In case you hadn't noticed,

09:51.678 --> 09:55.343
I have to answer to the same
commanding officer that you do.

09:59.812 --> 10:01.520
Come on, Spock.

10:01.689 --> 10:04.725
Yield to the logic of the situation.

10:06.653 --> 10:08.527
Very well.

10:09.447 --> 10:13.611
Examine me,
for all the good it will do either of us.

10:24.631 --> 10:26.291
How do you figure it, Chekov?

10:26.466 --> 10:29.503
First we're going to Vulcan.
Then we're going to Altair.

10:29.678 --> 10:33.676
Then we're headed to Vulcan again.
Now we're headed back to Altair.

10:33.849 --> 10:36.555
I think I'm going to get space-sick.

10:39.397 --> 10:41.390
Jim, you've got to get Spock
to Vulcan.

10:41.566 --> 10:44.022
Bones, I will, I will.
As soon as this mission is completed.

10:44.194 --> 10:47.445
No, now. Right away. If you don't get
him to Vulcan within a week,

10:47.615 --> 10:51.031
eight days at the outside, he'll die.

10:52.579 --> 10:53.859
He'll die, Jim.

11:04.258 --> 11:05.966
Why...

11:06.719 --> 11:10.765
...must he die?
Why within eight days? Explain.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.763
I don't know.

11:15.479 --> 11:18.017
You keep saying that.
Are you a doctor or aren't you?

11:18.399 --> 11:21.934
There's a growing imbalance
of body functions.

11:22.779 --> 11:25.151
As if in our bodies,
huge amounts of adrenaline

11:25.323 --> 11:28.740
were constantly being pumped
into our bloodstreams.

11:28.911 --> 11:31.319
Now, I can't trace it down
in my bio-comps.

11:31.497 --> 11:33.620
Spock won't tell me what it is.

11:33.916 --> 11:36.039
But if it isn't stopped somehow,

11:36.294 --> 11:40.209
the physical and emotional pressures
will simply kill him.

11:45.721 --> 11:48.259
You say you're convinced
he knows what it is?

11:48.432 --> 11:49.975
He does.

11:50.143 --> 11:54.223
And he's as tightlipped about it
as an Aldebaran shellmouth.

11:55.941 --> 11:59.025
No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.239
Come.

12:13.919 --> 12:15.579
Stay.

12:18.257 --> 12:21.175
McCoy has given me his
medical evaluation of your condition.

12:21.344 --> 12:25.010
He says you're going to die
unless something is done.

12:25.682 --> 12:27.011
What?

12:30.521 --> 12:32.810
Is it something only your planet
can do for you?

12:34.150 --> 12:35.479
Spock.

12:41.909 --> 12:44.151
You've been called
the best first officer in the Fleet.

12:46.163 --> 12:49.200
That's an enormous asset to me.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.670
If I have to lose that first officer,
I want to know why.

13:02.056 --> 13:05.057
It's a thing no outworlder may know...

13:05.226 --> 13:08.642
...except those very few
who've been involved.

13:10.899 --> 13:16.440
A Vulcan understands, but even we
do not speak of it among ourselves.

13:16.906 --> 13:20.524
It is a deeply personal thing.

13:21.077 --> 13:24.778
Can you see that, Captain,
and understand?

13:24.956 --> 13:27.080
No, I do not understand. Explain.

13:27.251 --> 13:28.626
Consider that an order.

13:31.047 --> 13:35.045
There are some things which transcend
even the discipline of the service.

13:43.727 --> 13:47.428
Would it help if I told you
that I'll treat this

13:47.607 --> 13:50.312
as totally confidential?

13:59.912 --> 14:03.862
It has to do with biology.

14:05.210 --> 14:08.959
- What?
- Biology.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.304
- What kind of biology?
- Vulcan biology.

14:17.473 --> 14:21.554
You mean, the biology of Vulcans?

14:22.312 --> 14:26.262
Biology as in reproduction?

14:28.777 --> 14:30.687
Well...

14:32.198 --> 14:34.487
...there's no need
to be embarrassed about it, Mr. Spock.

14:34.659 --> 14:36.153
It happens to the birds and bees.

14:36.328 --> 14:41.073
The birds and the bees
are not Vulcans, Captain.

14:43.002 --> 14:44.413
If they were,

14:44.587 --> 14:47.208
if any creature
as proudly logical as us,

14:47.381 --> 14:49.421
were to have their logic

14:49.592 --> 14:53.922
ripped from them
as this time does to us...

14:59.812 --> 15:02.813
How do Vulcans
choose their mates?

15:02.982 --> 15:04.856
Haven't you wondered?

15:06.903 --> 15:10.486
I guess the rest of us assume
that it's done...

15:11.700 --> 15:13.527
...quite logically.

15:23.004 --> 15:24.665
No.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.875
It is not.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.712
We shield it with ritual...

15:31.889 --> 15:34.891
...and customs shrouded in antiquity.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.559
You humans have no conception.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.813
It strips our minds from us.

15:44.362 --> 15:46.604
It brings a madness which

15:46.781 --> 15:51.906
rips away our veneer of civilisation.

15:52.621 --> 15:55.575
It is the Pon farr.

15:56.709 --> 15:59.200
The time of mating.

16:07.721 --> 16:10.010
There are precedents in nature,
Captain.

16:10.432 --> 16:12.923
The giant eel-birds of Regulus V,

16:13.102 --> 16:18.726
once each 11 years they must return
to the caverns where they hatched.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.944
On your Earth, salmon.

16:22.362 --> 16:25.613
They must return to that one stream

16:25.783 --> 16:30.326
where they were born
to spawn.

16:31.247 --> 16:33.287
Or die in trying.

16:36.002 --> 16:37.662
But you're not a fish, Mr. Spock.
You're...

16:37.838 --> 16:41.289
No, nor am I a man.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.460
I'm a Vulcan.

16:45.763 --> 16:48.089
I had hoped I would be spared this...

16:48.266 --> 16:51.053
...but the ancient drives
are too strong.

16:51.228 --> 16:53.980
Eventually they catch up with us.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.933
And we are driven by forces
we cannot control...

16:58.611 --> 17:00.936
...to return home...

17:01.489 --> 17:03.778
...and take a wife...

17:04.826 --> 17:06.319
...or die.

17:20.551 --> 17:23.589
I haven't heard a word you've said.

17:23.763 --> 17:25.507
And...

17:27.142 --> 17:30.559
I'll get you to Vulcan. Somehow.

17:35.485 --> 17:38.356
Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack
at Starfleet Command, Sector 9.

17:38.530 --> 17:40.440
Pipe it down to McCoy's office.

17:40.616 --> 17:42.692
Starfleet Command. Yes, sir.

17:43.035 --> 17:46.618
Mr. Sulu, you don't think...

17:46.789 --> 17:51.203
Maybe you ought to plot a course
back to Vulcan, just in case.

17:56.759 --> 17:59.464
Communication to Mr. Spock.
Lieutenant Uhura here.

17:59.637 --> 18:01.429
Captain asked me
to inform you he is...

18:01.597 --> 18:04.053
Let me alone!

18:04.893 --> 18:07.728
Captain, you're making
a most unusual request.

18:07.896 --> 18:10.222
I'm aware of that, sir.
But it's of the utmost importance.

18:10.399 --> 18:12.855
You must give me permission
to divert to Vulcan.

18:13.027 --> 18:15.649
But you refuse to explain
why it is so important.

18:16.406 --> 18:17.568
I can't, sir.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.947
But believe me,
I wouldn't make such a request...

18:20.118 --> 18:22.823
The Altair VI is no ordinary matter.

18:22.996 --> 18:27.244
That area is just putting itself together
after a long interplanetary conflict.

18:27.418 --> 18:30.585
This inauguration will stabilise
the entire Altair system.

18:30.922 --> 18:34.089
Our appearance there is a
demonstration of friendship

18:34.259 --> 18:37.545
and strength which will cause ripples
clear to the Klingon Empire.

18:37.804 --> 18:39.347
Sir...

18:39.515 --> 18:43.465
...the delay would be at most a day.
I can hardly believe...

18:43.644 --> 18:45.767
Kirk, you will proceed to
Altair VI as ordered.

18:45.938 --> 18:48.856
The subject is closed.
You have your orders. Starfleet out.

18:49.526 --> 18:53.606
- Well, that's that.
- No, it's not.

18:53.781 --> 18:56.070
I know the Altair situation.

18:56.408 --> 18:59.860
We would be one of three starships.
Very impressive, very diplomatic.

19:00.037 --> 19:01.200
It's simply not that vital.

19:01.372 --> 19:04.706
You can't go off to Vulcan against
Starfleet orders. You'll be busted...

19:04.876 --> 19:07.249
I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones?

19:07.963 --> 19:10.834
And he will if we go to Altair.

19:11.926 --> 19:15.840
I owe him my life a dozen times over.
Isn't that worth a career?

19:18.516 --> 19:20.556
He's my friend.

19:22.271 --> 19:25.521
- Bridge. Navigation.
- Bridge. Navigation.

19:25.774 --> 19:27.566
Mr. Chekov...

19:28.486 --> 19:32.733
...lay in a course for Vulcan. Tell
Engineering I want warp 8 or better.

19:32.907 --> 19:34.568
Push her for all she'll take.

19:34.743 --> 19:36.949
Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir.

19:38.330 --> 19:42.993
I see. Very well.
Carry on, Mr. Chekov. Kirk out.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.858
Miss Chapel?

20:08.947 --> 20:10.987
Yes, Mr. Spock?

20:13.536 --> 20:15.196
I had...

20:15.371 --> 20:17.993
...a most startling dream.

20:18.541 --> 20:20.534
You were trying to tell me something...

20:21.753 --> 20:23.212
...but I couldn't hear you.

20:30.972 --> 20:34.970
It would be illogical for us to protest...

20:35.143 --> 20:37.302
...against our natures...

20:38.063 --> 20:39.973
...don't you think?

20:40.149 --> 20:42.355
I don't understand.

20:47.073 --> 20:48.568
Your face is wet.

20:48.742 --> 20:52.158
I came to tell you
that we are bound for Vulcan.

20:52.663 --> 20:55.119
We'll be there in just a few days.

20:59.796 --> 21:00.958
Vulcan.

21:03.216 --> 21:06.917
- Miss Chapel.
- My name is Christine.

21:07.471 --> 21:10.093
Yes, I know, Christine.

21:11.934 --> 21:15.979
Would you make me
some of that plomeek soup?

21:18.233 --> 21:22.231
Oh, I'd be very glad to do that,
Mr. Spock.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.254
Bridge.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.050
It's obvious that
you've surmised my problem, Doctor,

21:47.223 --> 21:49.975
and my compliments on your insight.

21:50.143 --> 21:54.936
Captain, there is a thing that happens
to Vulcans at this time,

21:55.107 --> 21:58.358
almost an insanity, which you would
no doubt find distasteful.

21:58.569 --> 21:59.815
Will I?

21:59.988 --> 22:02.443
You've been most patient
with my kinds of madness.

22:03.450 --> 22:07.828
Then would you beam down to the
planet surface and stand with me?

22:07.997 --> 22:09.407
There is a brief ceremony.

22:09.832 --> 22:12.703
- Is it permitted?
- It is my right.

22:12.877 --> 22:16.329
By tradition, the male is accompanied
by his closest friends.

22:17.924 --> 22:19.169
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

22:21.178 --> 22:25.508
I also request McCoy accompany me.

22:25.891 --> 22:28.264
I shall be honoured, sir.

22:29.103 --> 22:30.728
Captain...

22:31.189 --> 22:33.763
...we're standing by
on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir.

22:33.942 --> 22:36.018
Open channel, Lieutenant.

22:36.779 --> 22:39.151
Vulcan Space Central,
this is the U.S.S. Enterprise

22:39.323 --> 22:41.945
requesting permission
to assume standard orbit.

22:42.118 --> 22:45.950
U.S.S. Enterprise from Vulcan Space
Central, permission granted.

22:46.122 --> 22:48.958
And from all of Vulcan, welcome.

22:49.126 --> 22:52.376
- Is Commander Spock with you?
- This is Spock.

22:52.546 --> 22:56.046
Stand by to activate
your central viewer, please.

22:58.803 --> 23:01.129
Doctor, what's going on?

23:06.103 --> 23:07.811
Spock.

23:08.188 --> 23:09.980
It is I.

23:10.524 --> 23:12.316
T'Pring.

23:12.485 --> 23:15.901
Parted from me and never parted.

23:16.072 --> 23:18.742
Never and always touching...

23:18.909 --> 23:20.902
...and touched.

23:21.078 --> 23:23.747
We meet at the appointed place.

23:24.582 --> 23:30.087
Spock.
Parted from me and never parted.

23:30.380 --> 23:34.959
Never and always touching
and touched.

23:35.427 --> 23:37.087
I await you.

23:37.680 --> 23:43.434
- She's lovely, Mr. Spock. Who is she?
- She is T'Pring...

23:44.270 --> 23:45.385
...my wife.

24:35.494 --> 24:37.902
This is the land of my family.

24:38.080 --> 24:42.956
It has been held by us
for more than 2000 Earth years.

24:43.837 --> 24:47.669
This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee.

24:52.638 --> 24:55.343
He called it Koon-ut what?

24:55.516 --> 24:58.387
He described it to me as meaning
"marriage or challenge."

24:58.561 --> 25:03.603
In the distant past,
Vulcans killed to win their mates.

25:03.775 --> 25:06.895
And they still go mad at this time.

25:09.865 --> 25:13.365
Perhaps the price they pay for having
no emotions the rest of the time.

25:13.536 --> 25:17.071
Lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.787
Yeah. "Hot as Vulcan." Now
I understand what that phrase means.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.869
The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.299
I wonder when his T'Pring arrives?

25:34.726 --> 25:37.134
The marriage party approaches.

25:37.897 --> 25:39.391
I hear them.

25:39.565 --> 25:42.816
Marriage party?
You said T'Pring was your wife.

25:42.986 --> 25:45.192
By our parents' arrangement.

25:45.363 --> 25:47.190
A ceremony...

25:47.366 --> 25:50.236
...while we were but 7 years of age.

25:51.036 --> 25:55.366
Less than a marriage,
but more than a betrothal.

25:58.169 --> 25:59.747
One touches the other

25:59.921 --> 26:03.966
in order to feel each other's thoughts.

26:04.259 --> 26:08.838
In this way,
our minds were locked together.

26:09.015 --> 26:12.051
So that at the proper time...

26:12.268 --> 26:15.602
...we would both be drawn to...

26:15.772 --> 26:17.729
... Koon-ut-kal-if-fee.

26:59.571 --> 27:02.608
Bones, do you know who that is?

27:11.334 --> 27:12.994
T'Pau.

27:13.753 --> 27:17.586
The only person to ever turn down
a seat in the Federation Council.

27:17.758 --> 27:19.549
T'Pau?

27:19.718 --> 27:22.007
Officiating at Spock's wedding?

27:22.179 --> 27:24.552
He never mentioned
that his family was this important.

28:11.568 --> 28:13.442
Spock...

28:14.279 --> 28:17.565
...are our ceremonies for outworlders?

28:17.741 --> 28:20.493
They are not outworlders.

28:20.661 --> 28:22.072
They are my friends.

28:24.123 --> 28:25.950
I am permitted this.

28:35.511 --> 28:37.504
This is Kirk.

28:38.014 --> 28:39.389
Ma'am.

28:43.853 --> 28:47.389
- And thee are called?
- Leonard McCoy, ma'am.

28:48.942 --> 28:53.605
Thee names
these outworlders "friends."

28:54.282 --> 28:57.034
How does thee pledge their behaviour?

28:57.202 --> 28:58.945
With my life, T'Pau.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.246
What thee are about to see...

29:06.295 --> 29:09.249
...comes down
from the time of the beginning...

29:09.632 --> 29:11.874
...without change.

29:12.218 --> 29:16.051
This is the Vulcan heart.
This is the Vulcan soul.

29:16.556 --> 29:18.715
This is our way.

30:16.707 --> 30:20.290
- What is it? What happened?
- She chooses the challenge.

30:21.212 --> 30:23.039
With him?

30:23.214 --> 30:26.085
He acts only if cowardice is seen.

30:28.512 --> 30:30.504
She will choose her champion.

30:34.810 --> 30:35.842
Spock?

30:36.020 --> 30:38.476
Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk.

30:39.899 --> 30:44.526
He is deep in the plak tow,
the blood fever.

30:45.322 --> 30:48.691
He will not speak with thee again

30:48.867 --> 30:52.818
until he has passed through
what is to come.

30:52.997 --> 30:55.915
If thee wishes to depart...

30:56.084 --> 30:57.709
...thee may leave now.

31:03.384 --> 31:04.629
We'll stay.

31:05.428 --> 31:08.631
Spock chose his friends well.

31:08.806 --> 31:10.087
Ma'am, I don't understand.

31:10.266 --> 31:13.801
Are you trying to say that she rejected
him. That she doesn't want him?

31:13.979 --> 31:18.357
He will have to fight for her.
It is her right.

31:21.863 --> 31:24.532
T'Pring, thee has chosen
the kal-if-fee...

31:24.908 --> 31:26.450
...the challenge.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.486
Thee are prepared
to become the property of the victor?

31:30.831 --> 31:32.622
I am prepared.

31:37.922 --> 31:39.120
Spock.

31:39.299 --> 31:44.091
Does thee accept challenge,
according to our laws and customs?

31:58.904 --> 32:01.146
You think Spock can take him?

32:02.950 --> 32:06.865
I doubt it. Not in his present condition.

32:07.246 --> 32:11.079
T'Pring,
thee will choose thy champion.

32:18.175 --> 32:20.845
As it was in the dawn of our days,

32:21.012 --> 32:22.839
as it is today

32:23.014 --> 32:25.766
as it will be for all tomorrows,

32:25.934 --> 32:28.176
I make my choice.

32:32.691 --> 32:34.020
This one.

32:38.281 --> 32:40.024
No.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.784
I am to be the one.

32:42.035 --> 32:44.075
- It was agreed.
- Be silent.

32:44.371 --> 32:46.079
Hear me.

32:46.248 --> 32:49.368
I have made the ancient claim.
I claim the right.

32:49.543 --> 32:51.038
The woman is...

32:56.760 --> 32:58.634
I ask forgiveness.

33:02.224 --> 33:03.932
Kirk...

33:05.102 --> 33:09.729
...T'Pring is within her rights,
but our laws and customs...

33:09.899 --> 33:11.892
...are not binding on thee.

33:12.068 --> 33:14.476
Thee are free to decline...

33:14.655 --> 33:16.980
...with no harm on thyself.

33:34.385 --> 33:36.045
T'Pau.

33:36.220 --> 33:38.260
Thee speaks?

33:39.265 --> 33:41.092
My friend...

33:41.601 --> 33:43.760
...does not understand.

33:44.354 --> 33:46.727
The choice has been made, Spock.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.393
It is up to him now.

33:48.692 --> 33:51.445
He does not know.

33:51.863 --> 33:57.320
I will do what I must, T'Pau.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.993
But not with him.

34:00.289 --> 34:04.239
His blood does not burn.

34:04.919 --> 34:06.199
He is my friend.

34:06.379 --> 34:10.958
It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin.

34:11.967 --> 34:16.049
Are thee Vulcan or are thee human?

34:17.766 --> 34:21.266
I burn, T'Pau.

34:21.646 --> 34:25.146
My eyes are flame.

34:25.525 --> 34:29.060
My heart is flame.

34:30.155 --> 34:33.737
Thee has the power, T'Pau.

34:34.284 --> 34:39.659
In the name of my fathers,
forbid.

34:43.629 --> 34:45.585
T'Pau.

34:46.422 --> 34:50.172
I plead with thee.

34:50.344 --> 34:51.969
I beg.

34:52.679 --> 34:57.841
Thee has prided thyself
on thy Vulcan heritage.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.890
It is decided.

35:24.549 --> 35:29.342
- What happens to Spock if I decline?
- Another champion will be selected.

35:30.806 --> 35:35.267
Do not interfere, Kirk. Keep thy place.

35:42.778 --> 35:43.892
You can't do it, Jim.

35:44.071 --> 35:45.613
- I can't?
- No.

35:45.781 --> 35:48.948
She said that their laws and customs
were not binding on you.

35:49.118 --> 35:52.072
And you said Spock
might not be able to handle him.

35:52.247 --> 35:55.082
Now, if I can knock Spock out
without really hurting him.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.828
In this climate?

35:57.002 --> 36:00.252
If the heat doesn't get you,
the thin air will.

36:19.861 --> 36:21.403
You can't do it.

36:21.571 --> 36:24.145
If I get into any trouble, I'll quit.

36:24.324 --> 36:26.613
And Spock wins,
and honour is satisfied.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.944
- Jim, listen, if you...
- Bones.

36:29.121 --> 36:30.580
He's my first officer and my friend.

36:30.748 --> 36:33.500
I disregarded Starfleet orders
to bring him here.

36:35.128 --> 36:39.837
Another thing, that's T'Pau,
a Vulcan.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.791
All of Vulcan in one package.

36:42.970 --> 36:45.805
How can I back out in front of her?

36:50.770 --> 36:51.849
It is done.

36:53.523 --> 36:56.311
Kirk, decide.

37:03.326 --> 37:06.777
I accept the challenge.

37:08.373 --> 37:11.160
Here begins the act of combat

37:11.335 --> 37:13.908
for possession of the woman T'Pring.

37:15.256 --> 37:20.630
As it was at the time of the beginning,
so it is now.

37:21.387 --> 37:23.261
Bring forth the lirpa.

37:47.208 --> 37:50.542
If both survive the lirpa...

37:51.004 --> 37:55.002
...combat will continue
with the ahn'woon.

37:55.175 --> 37:58.710
What do you mean, "if both survive"?

37:58.887 --> 38:01.889
This combat is to the death.

38:21.746 --> 38:24.154
Now, wait a minute, ma'am.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.409
Who said anything
about a fight to the death?

38:26.668 --> 38:29.788
These men are friends. To force them
to fight till one of them is killed...

38:29.964 --> 38:32.918
I can forgive such a display only once.

38:36.846 --> 38:40.263
Challenge was given
and lawfully accepted.

38:43.354 --> 38:44.516
It has begun.

38:45.731 --> 38:48.898
Let no one interfere.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.443
Spock, no!

40:19.210 --> 40:20.870
Is this Vulcan chivalry?

40:21.046 --> 40:23.667
The air is too hot and thin for Kirk.
He's not used to it.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.960
The air is the air. What can be done?

40:31.724 --> 40:36.054
I can compensate for the atmosphere
and the temperature with this.

40:36.229 --> 40:38.388
At least it will give Kirk
a fighting chance.

40:39.024 --> 40:40.566
Thee may proceed.

40:52.539 --> 40:55.077
You're going to have to kill him, Jim.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.124
Kill Spock?

40:57.294 --> 41:00.461
That's not what we came to Vulcan for,
is it?

41:01.090 --> 41:02.466
What's that?

41:02.633 --> 41:06.252
It's a tri-ox compound.
It'll help you breathe.

41:06.763 --> 41:10.429
- Now be careful.
- Sound medical advice.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.315
The ahn'woon.

42:48.293 --> 42:51.128
Get your hands off of him, Spock.

42:55.259 --> 42:56.504
It's finished.

43:01.474 --> 43:03.016
He's dead.

43:13.279 --> 43:15.272
I grieve with thee.

43:20.328 --> 43:24.077
- McCoy to Enterprise.
- Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura here.

43:24.625 --> 43:28.160
Have the Transporter Room stand by
to beam up the landing party.

43:39.516 --> 43:44.475
As strange as it may seem, Mr. Spock,
you're in command now.

43:45.398 --> 43:46.561
Any orders?

43:49.069 --> 43:50.527
Yes.

43:51.238 --> 43:54.441
I'll follow you up in a few minutes.

43:55.409 --> 43:57.734
You will instruct Mr. Chekov

43:57.912 --> 44:02.040
to plot a course
for the nearest star base...

44:03.001 --> 44:06.833
...where I must surrender myself
to the authorities.

44:19.144 --> 44:20.804
T'Pring.

44:22.147 --> 44:24.934
- Explain.
- Specify.

44:25.442 --> 44:26.985
Why the challenge.

44:27.153 --> 44:30.023
And why you chose my captain
as your champion.

44:30.907 --> 44:33.279
Stonn wanted me, I wanted him.

44:37.873 --> 44:41.823
I see no logic
in preferring Stonn over me.

44:43.337 --> 44:46.504
You have become much known
among our people, Spock.

44:46.674 --> 44:48.833
Almost a legend.

44:49.010 --> 44:50.421
And as the years went by,

44:50.595 --> 44:54.344
I came to know that I did not want
to be the consort of a legend.

44:54.933 --> 44:59.311
But by the laws of our people, I could
only divorce you by the kal-if-fee.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.897
There was also Stonn, who wanted
very much to be my consort,

45:03.068 --> 45:05.060
and I wanted him.

45:05.862 --> 45:08.235
If your captain were victor,
he would not want me

45:08.407 --> 45:10.316
and so I would have Stonn.

45:10.492 --> 45:13.613
If you were victor, you would free me
because I had dared to challenge

45:13.788 --> 45:16.196
and again I would have Stonn.

45:16.374 --> 45:19.874
But if you did not free me,
it would be the same.

45:20.045 --> 45:21.705
For you would be gone,

45:21.880 --> 45:24.550
and I would have your name
and your property,

45:25.301 --> 45:27.507
and Stonn would still be there.

45:29.305 --> 45:31.132
Logical.

45:31.307 --> 45:33.300
Flawlessly logical.

45:35.395 --> 45:38.396
- I am honoured.
- Stonn.

45:41.068 --> 45:42.860
She is yours.

45:43.571 --> 45:48.032
After a time,
you may find that having...

45:48.201 --> 45:53.196
...is not so pleasing a thing after all
as wanting.

45:53.916 --> 45:56.324
It is not logical...

45:56.711 --> 45:58.454
...but it is often true.

46:01.758 --> 46:04.925
Spock here. Stand by to beam up.

46:15.315 --> 46:19.265
Live long, T'Pau, and prosper.

46:19.444 --> 46:22.362
Live long and prosper, Spock.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.942
I shall do neither.

46:27.119 --> 46:31.283
I have killed my captain
and my friend.

46:42.511 --> 46:44.754
Energize.

47:03.410 --> 47:07.028
Doctor, I shall be resigning my
commission immediately, of course.

47:07.206 --> 47:12.164
So I would appreciate
your making the final arrangements.

47:12.336 --> 47:14.828
- Spock, I...
- Doctor, please, let me finish.

47:15.173 --> 47:17.842
There can be no excuse
for the crime of which I am guilty.

47:18.009 --> 47:19.552
I intend to offer no defence.

47:19.720 --> 47:23.219
Furthermore, I will order Mr. Scott to
take immediate command of this vessel.

47:23.390 --> 47:26.807
- Shouldn't you check with me first?
- Captain.

47:27.854 --> 47:29.597
Jim!

47:35.862 --> 47:39.861
I'm pleased to see you, Captain.

47:40.034 --> 47:43.569
You seem uninjured.

47:43.746 --> 47:46.202
I am at something of a loss
to understand it, however.

47:46.458 --> 47:47.738
Blame McCoy.

47:47.918 --> 47:50.456
That was no tri-ox compound
he shot me with.

47:50.712 --> 47:54.793
He slipped in a neural paralyzer.
Knocked me out. Simulated death.

47:55.301 --> 47:58.884
- Indeed.
- Nurse, would you mind, please?

48:06.063 --> 48:08.732
Spock, what happened down there?
The girl, the wedding?

48:08.899 --> 48:10.310
Oh, yes, the girl.

48:10.484 --> 48:13.521
Most interesting.
It must have been the combat.

48:13.696 --> 48:17.741
When I thought I had killed the Captain,
I found I'd lost all interest in T'Pring.

48:17.909 --> 48:20.317
The madness was gone.

48:22.748 --> 48:24.242
- Kirk here.
- Captain Kirk.

48:24.416 --> 48:26.872
Message from Starfleet Command.
Top priority.

48:29.088 --> 48:30.251
Relay it, Lieutenant.

48:31.174 --> 48:35.836
Response to T'Pau's request
for diversion of Enterprise to Vulcan

48:36.013 --> 48:39.678
hereby approved.
Any reasonable delay granted.

48:39.850 --> 48:42.935
Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command.

48:43.104 --> 48:45.429
A little late,
but I'm glad they're seeing it our way.

48:45.607 --> 48:47.932
How about that T'Pau?
They couldn't turn her down.

48:48.109 --> 48:49.734
Mr. Chekov,

48:49.903 --> 48:54.649
lay in a course for Altair VI.
Leave orbit when ready. Kirk out.

48:54.825 --> 48:56.284
There's just one thing, Mr. Spock,

48:56.452 --> 48:58.279
you can't tell me
when you saw Jim alive,

48:58.454 --> 49:00.613
you weren't on the verge of giving
an emotional scene

49:00.790 --> 49:02.450
that would've brought the house down.

49:02.626 --> 49:04.784
Merely my quite logical relief

49:04.962 --> 49:07.583
that Starfleet had not lost
a highly proficient captain.

49:07.756 --> 49:10.461
- Yes, Mr. Spock. I understand.
- Thank you, Captain.

49:10.635 --> 49:13.304
Of course, Mr. Spock.
Your reaction was quite logical.

49:13.471 --> 49:15.179
Thank you, Doctor.

49:15.765 --> 49:17.924
In a pig's eye.

49:20.938 --> 49:23.511
Come on, Spock.
Let's go mind the store.
