WEBVTT

00:54.924 --> 00:57.187
I love a good fire. Mmm.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.452
Let's get this place set.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.675
Ooh, this can
go right here.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.244
Well, y'all
gonna have to go,

01:10.244 --> 01:11.941
just for the weekend, though.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.119
Cheers to us.

01:23.735 --> 01:24.736
Hello?

01:28.305 --> 01:29.263
Hello?

01:31.569 --> 01:33.745
Hello? Shawn?

01:36.183 --> 01:37.271
Yo, stop playing.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.103
I got a gun!
God damn it.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.018
Hey, yo...
That's too DMX.
What are you doing?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.282
Baby, is that you?

01:52.024 --> 01:54.462
- Damn, Morgan!
- Nigga!

01:54.462 --> 01:55.767
See, I knew
I shouldn't have got you

01:55.767 --> 01:57.291
the Muay Thai class
for Christmas.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.206
You "strong" strong.
You strong with a C.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.903
But why the hell
didn't you say something?

02:00.903 --> 02:02.339
Damn, you almost made me
spill my wine.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.862
So, you almost
break your man nose,

02:03.862 --> 02:05.647
but, "Oh, no, my wine?"

02:05.647 --> 02:08.562
Baby, we are all alone
in a cabin in the woods.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.348
Until the others get here,
you got to announce yourself.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.611
- You asking for too much.
- Am I?

02:14.917 --> 02:16.484
I'll touch your penis later.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.270
- Deal.
-  So predictable.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.489
Okay, okay, but you gotta
check out this room.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.447
- This shit is wild.
- How wild?

02:23.447 --> 02:25.667
- Come on.
- Oh, you like it sick. Okay.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.885
Follow me.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.409
Follow the leader, huh?

02:28.409 --> 02:29.540
Yeah.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.420
Stop playing.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.248
Is it Blade's house?
Where's Wesley?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.293
I want to talk to Wesley.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.034
If it is, you know what they
pay you for. Wait, hold up.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.906
I know I left this door open.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.603
- Uh-uh.
I'mma go get my sage.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.606
Come on, come on,
come on, now. We good.

02:51.606 --> 02:52.911
Listen, I won't play.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.043
I watched a whole entire Datelineepisode

02:55.043 --> 02:56.654
with this psycho brother
and sister

02:56.654 --> 02:58.482
who kept
their incest-bred kids

02:58.482 --> 03:00.354
hidden under the stairs
of their Airbnb.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.616
Also, that wasn't Dateline,

03:01.616 --> 03:02.747
that was just the plot
from the movie

03:02.747 --> 03:04.532
People Under the Stairs.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.620
You might be right.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.448
Oh.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.754
Kinda fucked myself up,
but here you go.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.540
- You okay?
- Enter my port of doom.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.281
- Wow.
- Come on, come, come.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.499
Did you know this house
was gonna have

03:15.499 --> 03:16.631
this cool ass game room?

03:16.631 --> 03:18.328
No, I did not.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.156
But that's not why
I brought you in here.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.331
You gotta check this out.

03:23.725 --> 03:26.293
- The Blackening.
Seriously?
- Yup.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.773
Whoa!

03:28.773 --> 03:30.688
What in
the Jim Crow fuck, right?

03:30.688 --> 03:32.951
Uh-uh.
This is hella disturbing.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.562
Why the hell is this
in this house?

03:34.562 --> 03:37.129
This was not in
any of the reviews,
but guess what?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.392
It's about to be.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.785
I don't know but
as soon as I get a signal,

03:40.785 --> 03:43.484
I'm fittin' to cancel
their asses immediately.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.312
Yo, AirDrop me all of that.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.836
I got you.
Say, "Cheese," motherfucker.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.491
- Baby, this is wild.
- Yeah.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.753
How do you even
play this game?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.929
- Like, what are the rules?
- You tryna play?

03:53.929 --> 03:57.324
I mean, I'm
a little curious.
Aren't you?

03:57.324 --> 03:59.804
I can't even get you
to play Spades but
you all over Sambo.

03:59.804 --> 04:02.764
Oh. At least Sambo
don't renege.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.419
Nigga, if you say
you don't have hearts,
guess what?

04:05.419 --> 04:06.724
You shouldn't have hearts.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.248
Pick a card.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.643
At least we know it's working.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.819
- Shit probably runs on racism.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.603
Now, that is one battery

04:16.603 --> 04:18.997
- that ain't dying no time soon.
- That's a sober comment

04:18.997 --> 04:20.738
- right there, baby.
- Pick a card!

04:20.738 --> 04:22.871
Okay, nigga, calm down.
I just did.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.308
Yeah, and you better
watch how you talking
to my lady, okay?

04:25.308 --> 04:26.657
- Okay.
- What you got?

04:26.657 --> 04:29.399
"You are a Black character
in a horror movie.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.662
"Prove that
you can stay alive.

04:31.662 --> 04:34.491
"Name one Black character
that survived a horror movie.

04:34.491 --> 04:38.190
"You must answer correctly,
or you die." What the hell?

04:38.190 --> 04:40.758
So this is just
an aggressively-themed
trivia game.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.891
Hold up, were there even
niggas in horror movies

04:42.891 --> 04:45.546
- when this game was created?
- Baby, you're thinking
too much about this,

04:45.546 --> 04:46.851
all right?
I know the answer.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.724
It is Jada Pinkett,
Omar Epps, Scream 2.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.291
Boom, Sambo.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.031
Them niggas
was the first to die.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.381
What are you talking about?

04:54.381 --> 04:55.730
I honestly think
that the studio didn't have

04:55.730 --> 04:57.340
the budget to keep 'em
the whole movie.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.560
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's why they had
to die first.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.655
All right, let's see
what we got here.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.398
- We got game pieces.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.399
Wait a minute.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.880
Don't this look like
my earring?

05:16.620 --> 05:17.839
Let me see.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.667
Yeah, like,
it's the same but different.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.364
- Your time has run out.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.931
You did not answer correctly.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.715
But hold up.
How the hell
does a game know

05:24.715 --> 05:26.064
if we answer correctly
or not?

05:26.064 --> 05:28.806
It don't. Watch this.
You watching us, Sambo?

05:29.981 --> 05:32.941
Well, yes, I am.
It's time to die.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.467
Fuck!

05:40.514 --> 05:42.777
I can't see.
Where are you?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.605
Baby? Baby? Keep talking.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.347
Morgan, baby, follow my voice.
Follow my voice. I'm over here.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.132
Okay, you got me. You got me.
Come on, come on, come on.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.743
Okay, okay.
You got me.
You got me.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.137
I'm so scared.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.315
Listen.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.491
Is that...

06:01.491 --> 06:03.058
Is that breathing?

06:03.058 --> 06:05.190
Wait. Let me get my phone.
Let me get my phone.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.368
Okay. Got it.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.850
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:13.677 --> 06:14.678
Okay.

06:15.549 --> 06:16.593
Hello?

06:17.768 --> 06:19.422
Shawn?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.730
Shawn?

06:28.649 --> 06:31.086
Run, nigga.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.355
Hey!

06:39.355 --> 06:42.314
Peekaboo, I see you.

06:54.022 --> 06:58.374
Time to die!
Time to die! Time to die!

06:59.157 --> 07:00.594
Time to die!

08:35.165 --> 08:36.385
Hey, guys!

08:36.385 --> 08:39.082
Listen, I cannot wait
to see you guys.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.216
Oh, remember,
when you turn on Valley Lane,

08:41.216 --> 08:43.479
it's gonna feel like
you've gone too far

08:43.479 --> 08:44.654
because you in the woods.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.526
But just keep coming.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.962
Shawn almost got us
lost earlier.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.224
Man, no I didn't, Morgan.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.878
- Don't tell 'em that.
Anyway,

08:50.878 --> 08:53.837
I got the games ready.
Time to get it cracking!

08:53.837 --> 08:55.056
- Oh, shit.
- God damn.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.840
This whole reunion
about to crack,

08:56.840 --> 08:58.799
and you know
Morgan ain't playing

08:58.799 --> 09:00.235
when it comes to
the party planning.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.846
Okay, because we about
to turn it all the way up.

09:02.846 --> 09:06.197
- I got some shrooms, molly.
- Oh, that sounds good.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.808
Ooh, and I got some
nice herb in the back.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.419
I don't even care.
We got the whole crew
back, okay?

09:10.419 --> 09:14.597
Got all eight of us.
We did that, y'all.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.295
Pause, pause, pause.
Eight? What do you mean eight?

09:17.295 --> 09:20.298
I know seven.
Who all gon' be there?

09:20.298 --> 09:22.300
Bitch,
you didn't tell him that
Nnamdi was coming?

09:22.300 --> 09:23.824
I was going to.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.608
Really?
Hell no!

09:25.608 --> 09:27.262
I knew it.
By the way,

09:27.262 --> 09:29.960
- I like this haircut on you.
Thanks, girl.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.484
Hello, bitches.
I see y'all exchanging looks.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.660
What are y'all
shady asses hiding?

09:33.660 --> 09:34.922
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.532
Matter of fact,
y'all are hiding someone.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.361
Again, answer my question,
who all gon' be there?

09:39.361 --> 09:41.798
Who cares who's going?

09:41.798 --> 09:43.844
It's been 10 years
since we all hung out.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.672
We came to have fun.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.108
Yes, please.

09:47.108 --> 09:51.503
We need some reckless,
unadulterated fun.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.070
We all desperately need it,

09:53.070 --> 09:54.724
- especially you, Dewayne.
- Especially you.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.204
Okay, you ain't gotta
say it like that.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.336
But, yes,
you are right.

09:58.336 --> 10:01.383
I do need fun,
and I am very excited
to see everybody.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.126
As long as
Nnamdi's not there.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.170
He not gonna be there, right?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.874
Yes, it's that good shit.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.441
No, they don't.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.270
Rap Snack?

11:02.270 --> 11:05.447
Okay, Chainsaw Massacreman,
I see you.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.370
Hey. Stranger danger.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.024
- Sorry.
- Shanika?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.113
Carlton?

11:19.113 --> 11:22.029
- Clifton.
- Clifton. Yes!

11:22.029 --> 11:23.900
Oh, my God,
what you doing out here
in the middle of nowhere?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.641
Oh, come on.
Aren't you here
for the reunion?

11:25.641 --> 11:27.556
Yeah, yes,
the reunion.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.297
- Yes, I am.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.912
Wow.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.436
Anyhoo, I was actually
on my way to the soiree,

11:38.436 --> 11:40.264
but I forgot
my phone charger,

11:40.264 --> 11:42.266
and then
my phone died.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.312
It's not the end
of the world. It's okay.
It's fine, right?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.444
But then my Hyundai
died up the road.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.708
- Your what?
- Hyundai died up the road.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.536
And I get here,
they don't even
have my charger.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.713
They have iPhone,
I have Android.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.585
- Damn. I'm sorry,
that does suck.
- It does.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.761
- Not the car, the Android.
- You're funny.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.372
We all know Androids
have the superior
operating systems.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.461
Wrong!

12:03.461 --> 12:05.812
That's wrong.
But it's okay.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.989
I'm gonna help
yo ass get gas
despite your opinions.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.381
Come on. Let's go.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.905
And why do you
got so much damn
toilet paper?

12:11.905 --> 12:13.558
You have so many
Rap Snacks.
That's a lot of salt.

12:13.558 --> 12:14.864
Okay, is it just me

12:14.864 --> 12:17.562
or is this giving
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.173
I don't know,
I never seen that film.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.609
White people scare me.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.872
- But your daddy is White.
- Exactly.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.569
And, girl, that's why
every single time
he gets mad,

12:24.569 --> 12:27.790
I'm like, "Oh, Lord,
here it comes:
murder-suicide."

12:29.052 --> 12:30.445
You know I'm serious.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.014
Oh, God!

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
No!

12:38.018 --> 12:41.717
Oh, my God, really, bitch?
A cabin in the woods?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.197
It's technically a house.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.025
- I think it's cute.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.461
But she got money.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.550
We could have went to,
like, a five-star resort.

12:51.596 --> 12:52.728
You're
wasting your time.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.338
Just
answer the question

12:54.338 --> 12:56.645
- so I can find out...
- What seems to be
the problem?

12:56.645 --> 12:59.735
I'm trying to explain
to him that I'm staying here
for the week,

12:59.735 --> 13:00.910
I just didn't
have the code, but...

13:00.910 --> 13:02.520
- Who are you?
- Are you a cop?

13:02.520 --> 13:05.175
I'm a park ranger,
and your friend here
is trespassing.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.742
No, he's not.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.961
See? Right here.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.441
All of our names are listed.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.921
We have the home
for the weekend.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.358
- Told you.
- And here is my license.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.147
Excuse me.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.367
Normally, the Conners
only rent to...

13:23.367 --> 13:24.412
White people?

13:25.761 --> 13:27.850
- Families.
- White families.

13:27.850 --> 13:28.851
Mmm.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.941
You all have a wonderful stay.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.773
"You have a wonderful time."
He sounds like my dad.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.732
Ew. I didn't know
park rangers have guns.
That is unsettling.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.865
Well, that was
completely unnecessary.

13:42.865 --> 13:46.260
Don't even trip. Can't let
the ignorance of his prejudice
disrupt our inner peace.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.610
- What?
- Okay, Gandhi.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.440
So when did you get
all namaste, King?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.224
Is this the same King
we went to college with?

13:54.224 --> 13:56.009
Of course it is.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.011
What is this sensitive energy?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.493
Where are Shawn and Morgan at?

14:02.493 --> 14:04.147
They texted me.
They probably just went out.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.235
They'll be back soon.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.411
Anyway,
happy Juneteenth, niggas!

14:07.411 --> 14:09.544
- Happy Juneteenth!
- Happy Juneteenth!

14:09.544 --> 14:11.415
Happy Juneteenth,
Ranger White!

14:11.415 --> 14:13.591
- Aye!

14:13.591 --> 14:15.506
- Whose car is this?
Hey, yo!

14:15.506 --> 14:17.769
It's... I'm gonna go
get my bag.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.207
Brother Nnamdi.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.382
Sister Allison Tubman.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.426
Good to see you.

14:22.905 --> 14:23.863
Sister.

14:24.559 --> 14:25.777
- What's up?
- Hey.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.042
'Sup.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.130
I gotta go get my bag.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.308
So, what's up,
y'all ready to party?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.352
Yup.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.449
Sorry.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.625
I should have told you
that Nnamdi and I are
friends again.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.714
Yeah, you should have.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.456
But honestly, at this point,
it is what it is.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.763
But friends. I'm confused,
when did that happen?

14:54.763 --> 14:56.460
Because last time I checked,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.854
that was the nigga
that cheated on you
again, and again.

14:58.854 --> 15:02.336
I'm over that.
College was a long time ago.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.511
People can grow, Dewayne.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.165
Are you saying
I haven't grown?

15:05.165 --> 15:07.950
Look, Nnamdi and I
are just friends,
so you can relax.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.083
Can we please enjoy this?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.476
It'll be like the old days.

15:12.476 --> 15:15.479
Party, play some of
Morgan's games,

15:15.479 --> 15:17.351
party some more.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.268
- Fine.
- Close your eyes.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.792
- Do you trust me?
-  With my life.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.315
Take a deep breath.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.491
Now, inhale
through your mouth.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.364
- Swallow.
- Mmm. What is this?

15:30.364 --> 15:32.409
Molly. Now, stop
being sad and pressed.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.584
Time to party, bitch.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.108
- Molly?
- Yup.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.892
- You know that's
my drug of choice.
- Let's do it!

15:44.508 --> 15:46.032
Hello?

15:47.729 --> 15:49.383
Yo!

15:49.383 --> 15:53.387
Oh, my gosh.
This is so cute!

15:53.387 --> 15:56.433
I bet you Morgan did this.
You know she loves decorating.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.261
I bet you they already took
the best rooms, too.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.523
Oh, my gosh.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.698
Shit, look, Allison.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.484
Even got a picture of you
on the wall, too.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.749
Fuck you, Nnamdi.
That's your ex-girlfriend.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.793
You know,
the one with the teeth?

16:08.793 --> 16:11.100
- Okay.
- Uh-oh.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.320
You know what time it is
when these cards come out?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.278
You taking
all the Spade fades.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.584
You still like losing?

16:16.584 --> 16:17.802
If this is how
you wanna start the weekend,

16:17.802 --> 16:19.021
that's fine with me, gentlemen.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.762
Because me and Lisa
about to come back

16:20.762 --> 16:22.633
and issue that smackdown.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.549
Let me go drop my bags,
and I will be right back.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.248
This is nice.
I bet you this is all
repurposed wood, too.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.373
Hmm. This must be
where they keep
their personal items.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.332
- It's locked.
- Or maybe it's
the master bedroom.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.898
And Morgan and Shawn,

17:10.898 --> 17:12.378
the couple
of the friend group, took it.

17:12.378 --> 17:16.035
Okay. Speaking of couples,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.211
a little birdy told me
that another couple

17:18.211 --> 17:20.300
may be in our friend group.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.606
I'm not saying,
I'm just saying.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.391
You're not saying, but you're
just saying what, Allison?

17:24.391 --> 17:25.740
I'm just saying, Nnamdi,

17:25.740 --> 17:28.525
do not break her heart again,
and I mean that.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.354
I got you.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.400
And remember,
you gonna have to deal
with Dewayne, too.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.058
Mix it up, baby.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.494
Oh, yeah.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.109
Mmm-hmm.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.937
This ain't the Blackest
shit ever?

17:48.937 --> 17:51.505
You know what else
is real Black? Diabetes.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.115
Ain't nobody drinking that.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.638
- We're good.
- You know what?

17:54.638 --> 17:56.249
I'mma pray that you get
all that hate out your heart.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.554
And why would you do that?

17:57.554 --> 18:00.253
That's what keeps me
nice and young.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.037
Stop playing, you gonna
make me drop these.

18:05.693 --> 18:06.694
Okay.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.932
- My brotha.
- Hey. Let's go.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.457
I call it King's Kool-Ayyy.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.243
The fuck, brother.
Call it King's Kool-No.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.767
- Is it that bad?
- Yes, bro. You tripping.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.204
Sugar fuck around
and give you a cramp.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.468
God damn! Shit!

18:44.732 --> 18:47.691
Damn. But shit, bro,
how you been?

18:47.691 --> 18:49.693
I've been good,
you know.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.565
I feel like everything's
starting to fall into place.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.871
- Okay.
- Got steady clients
at the gym.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.830
I'm seeing this girl now.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.788
Oh, shit. Only one?

18:57.788 --> 19:00.530
Yes, bro. Only one.
I'm a new man.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.576
Wow. You know
what I call that?

19:02.576 --> 19:04.404
- Mmm. Growth.
- Delusion.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.493
- What?
- You been saying
that same thing

19:06.493 --> 19:08.059
like, every two years
since we met.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.061
You do some fuck shit,
you feel bad,

19:10.061 --> 19:12.803
you reflect,
become a new man.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.501
But then the new nigga
do some fuck shit,

19:14.501 --> 19:16.372
and the whole cycle
just start over again.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.721
Come on, bruh.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.027
- This time is different.
- This time is different.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.814
Nigga, you say
the same thing every time.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.076
You ain't changed.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.644
Man, fuck all that bull.
What about you?

19:29.037 --> 19:31.692
What, you still a slave
to the White man?

19:31.692 --> 19:34.390
Y'all gonna stop calling
my wife the White man,
all right?

19:34.390 --> 19:36.871
- Her name is Jenny.
- Okay.

19:36.871 --> 19:40.179
And she ain't "White" White.
She ethnic White.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.006
- She Armenian.
- Come on, man.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.747
That bitch is dog-kisses
on-the-mouth,

19:43.747 --> 19:48.535
pumpkin-spice-latte,
Sweet-Caroline,
Bye-Bye-ByeWhite.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.972
So, you just gon'
call my wife a bitch?

19:50.972 --> 19:53.801
Just, come on, bruh.
Nah, I meant bitch
in the colloquial sense.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.237
You know, like,

19:55.237 --> 19:57.544
"Hey, bitch.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.372
"You gon' finish
that quesadilla?"

20:00.460 --> 20:01.939
Yeah, no, that was
a bad example.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.683
All right, look, bruh,
I didn't mean...

20:06.683 --> 20:07.815
I'm fucking with you.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.298
- Fuck outta here, bro.
- I'm fucking with you.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.386
I'm a changed man.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.954
Shit, look at me.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.087
So, you telling me
she wrung every bit
of the thug out of you, bro?

20:19.087 --> 20:20.393
There's not even
a little bit left?

20:20.393 --> 20:22.133
Like, you really
ain't packing right now?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.788
Nah, man.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.486
Man, you really
in the "Sunken Place."

20:28.270 --> 20:31.273
Balls deep, my brother.
Balls deep.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.242
You got a heart?
Nope.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.852
You got that last club,
don't you?

20:44.852 --> 20:47.855
Yup, and it's low.
Got you.

20:50.161 --> 20:53.643
Oh, yeah, she love
the club. Let me see.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.037
Yo, I hate these dudes.
I hate 'em.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.561
Not a good time.

20:58.561 --> 21:01.564
I knew it,
and that might be board.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.182
Five.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.058
That may be the dagger.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.929
Shit. All I got is a...

21:18.929 --> 21:21.671
- Dang, bitch!

21:21.671 --> 21:24.152
That's my partner, okay?

21:24.152 --> 21:27.503
That is what we do
on Juneteenth, motherfuckers.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.679
- Y'all cheated, man.
- So now we cheated?

21:29.679 --> 21:31.377
Congratulations.
Chivalry's not dead.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.943
Oh, oh. Take your L and go.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.902
Nnam, that's something
a loser would say, Nnamdi.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.207
Don't be a sore loser.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.734
Hey, Dewayne,
you wanna run one?

21:40.734 --> 21:41.822
Come on, Dewayne.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.824
Come on, bro,
let's run one.

21:43.824 --> 21:46.957
Dewayne, did you just
shift in your seat at me,
you little moody ass?

21:46.957 --> 21:49.612
- What is wrong with Dewayne?
- He always does this.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.223
First, he gets all
introspective and shit,

21:52.223 --> 21:53.529
and then 20 minutes later...

21:57.228 --> 21:59.622
I fucking love this song.
Are y'all hot?

21:59.622 --> 22:02.495
- Kinda hot.
Oh, he needs
some water.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.758
Yup, that molly
finally got his ass.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.805
Oh, my God, he is wilding.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.154
Oh, I feel like the music is

22:10.154 --> 22:11.199
- kissing me on my neck.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.940
Nobody
kissing your neck.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.768
Yes, Dewayne.
Come on!

22:17.945 --> 22:19.686
You better
rip those pants off, Dewayne.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.734
Come on, who needs
clothes, boo? Yes!

22:25.648 --> 22:26.997
No. No.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.564
You got it going, Dewayne.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.206
Nnamdi, is that you?

23:27.754 --> 23:30.104
Shit! You scared me.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.074
Hey, what's the problem?

23:44.771 --> 23:46.599
I feel bad.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.687
Dewayne still doesn't know

23:47.687 --> 23:49.471
- we got back together.
- Dewayne?

23:53.388 --> 23:55.782
Maybe if you tell him,

23:55.782 --> 23:58.393
you might realize
that you outgrew your friend.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.743
Boy.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.919
You really thought
you just said something.

24:02.919 --> 24:05.182
"You realize you've
outgrown your friend."

24:07.620 --> 24:09.665
You don't know shit
about my friendship.

24:10.666 --> 24:11.624
- Okay.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.367
-  Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

24:16.367 --> 24:17.673
My molly just hit.

24:19.719 --> 24:24.071
Look, I'm sorry
I lashed out.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.508
I was projecting a bit,
but you were overstepping.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.425
Now...

24:32.427 --> 24:34.124
- take your pants off.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.839
Boo, motherfucker!

25:38.449 --> 25:40.234
Bitch, you play too much.
I almost hit you.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.236
- Nigga, is you high?
- A little bit.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.585
- You on molly?
- Yeah.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.934
Gimme some.
Where you got some at?

25:44.934 --> 25:46.414
- Oh, my God. Go in the house.
- Okay. Get me...

25:46.414 --> 25:48.503
- Get me some molly.
- Ow. You so late, move.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.549
Hold on! 'Bout to fuck up
my Moscato.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.376
- This is peach lavender.
- Go through the front door.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.335
- I love you.
- Love you.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.818
Happy Juneteenth, niggas!
Shanika in the hizzouse.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.559
Hey.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.473
- What's up, Ally?
Girlfriend, hi!

26:02.473 --> 26:03.823
Yes, how are ya?

26:03.823 --> 26:05.346
It's so good to see you, boo.
Put that on ice.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.174
- What's up, Shanika?
Where you been?
- What up, nigga?

26:07.174 --> 26:10.481
I got lost, and then
my car couldn't make
it up that fucking hill.

26:10.481 --> 26:13.136
- Y'all, I ran into, um...
- Clifton.

26:13.136 --> 26:17.184
I have not seen you
since we were at the...

26:17.184 --> 26:19.752
At the one...
- I don't know that nigga.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.231
- At the...
- School.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.668
- School!
- School!

26:22.668 --> 26:23.756
That's what it was.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.018
- All right.
- Yes.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.150
- Well, welcome.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.545
I mean, I'm surprised
I was invited, too.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.982
Anyway, do you guys
have an Android charger?

26:32.982 --> 26:34.854
I told you,
we don't support that.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.552
All right, well,
you can't win 'em all.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.207
- Thanks for having me.
- Y'all, where's Lisa?

26:40.207 --> 26:42.296
I know y'all motherfuckers
didn't start numbing
reality without me,

26:42.296 --> 26:43.689
'cause if you did...

26:43.689 --> 26:44.994
What up, Lis?

26:46.387 --> 26:49.303
You smell like dick.
What the fuck you been doing?

26:51.348 --> 26:53.655
Oh. That's who you been doing.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.701
I accidentally
smelled some of the dick.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.488
Oh, wow.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.751
So, Lisa the new girl
you was telling me about?

27:11.499 --> 27:14.502
Oh, so suddenly it's quiet
and all eyes are on me.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.330
Is that my reputation?

27:16.330 --> 27:18.549
Something happens
and y'all just waiting
on me to be combative?

27:20.377 --> 27:22.945
Guys, I'm not even mad,
I promise.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.208
Lis, I'm tryna be
as fucked up as he is.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.645
Let's get
this party started.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.037
Yep. We should all
take shots, right?

27:28.037 --> 27:29.604
Yes. Please.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.388
Get back to handing out
these ass-whoopings in Spades.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.216
Who are
you talking to?

27:33.216 --> 27:35.523
Oh, puh-lease. 'Cause
you know good and well

27:35.523 --> 27:37.612
we've been whooping your ass
all night, right, Lisa?

27:37.612 --> 27:39.440
Y'all got lucky.
Don't let it go to your heads.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.573
- Hey, Dewayne.
- Hey.

27:42.573 --> 27:45.838
Oh, my God. Gal,
it's so nice to see you again.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.188
- It's Clifton.
- Oh... Yes.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.929
Oh, my God, I'm so...
I knew that.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.757
I'm so sorry.
I've taken a lot of drugs.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.193
Do you know where
I can put my bag?

27:53.193 --> 27:54.281
Mmm-mmm.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.979
Where's Morgan and Shawn?

27:56.979 --> 27:59.199
I got a text last night
saying that they made it here.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.157
They texted us
earlier, actually,

28:01.157 --> 28:03.943
and told us that
they were gonna come back
later on this evening.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.597
- Hey, thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.121
- Here, Clifton.
- Thank you, baby.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.688
- No, hold it, nigga.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.691
- I have a toast.
- Yes!

28:12.691 --> 28:15.606
On this Juneteenth Day,
I would like to
celebrate freedom.

28:15.606 --> 28:16.782
- Freedom.
- Freedom.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.697
Freedom from
caring about people

28:18.697 --> 28:20.394
more than they care
about themselves.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.484
A friend of mine once told me,
"People can grow."

28:23.484 --> 28:25.007
At the time,
I didn't know what
she meant,

28:25.007 --> 28:27.923
but now I know
that she meant, "Grow apart."

28:27.923 --> 28:30.491
Uh-huh.
And then they die.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.188
- And that's called fate.
- Dewayne.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.496
Mmm. Cheers to having
standards and self-respect.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.933
To friendship for life.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.456
- For life.
- For life.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.241
Lovely. That
sounds awesome.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.724
Oh, my God, holy shit,
King. That tastes
like pure sugar.

28:45.724 --> 28:50.076
I call it King's Kool-Ayyy.

28:50.076 --> 28:52.600
- You drink it,
it make you go, "Ayyy."
Bruh.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.341
I love you, but
you gonna have
to give it up.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.734
Okay, you know what?
Keep drinking that shit

28:55.734 --> 28:56.909
and watch yourself
get some cramps.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.388
Shut up.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.955
Let's get into these Spades.
That's why we came here,

28:59.955 --> 29:01.696
- right?
Let's do it.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.219
So, look, it's gonna be
Allison and Lisa,
and me and Nnamdi.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.525
Uh, can I play?

29:04.525 --> 29:05.700
I don't know, can you?

29:05.700 --> 29:07.658
Well, can you teach me?

29:07.658 --> 29:08.921
Look, come on, bruh,
ain't nobody ever teach you
how to play Spades?

29:08.921 --> 29:10.618
I've played before, I just...

29:10.618 --> 29:13.099
- I forgot some of the...
- King?

29:13.099 --> 29:15.362
Look, man, we ain't
got time to be teaching
you how to play.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.320
You can sit on the sideline,
you can watch.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.367
If you learn,
cool, if not...

29:20.367 --> 29:22.891
Yeah, sure, of course.
I'll watch.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.676
You know what?
You can learn,

29:25.676 --> 29:27.722
but it's just that you gonna
have to be on a team
in order to learn.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.725
And this weekend,
it is women against boys.

29:30.725 --> 29:31.944
So, I mean
if you're learning,

29:31.944 --> 29:33.380
you got to learn
from your gender folk.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.773
That ain't gonna happen.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.952
Yeah, learn from the losers
'cause we finna getting
that ass, right?

29:39.952 --> 29:42.084
Okay! Bussin', baby.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.136
Where are you going?

29:50.136 --> 29:51.615
I'm gonna look
for the fuse box.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.837
- What the hell was that?
- What was what?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.583
- I see nothing.
Was it a raccoon?

30:02.583 --> 30:04.498
No, it was bigger
than a raccoon.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.369
Was it a bear?
All right,
we gotta find the lights.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.415
Yeah, I'm with King.
I'm not gonna...

30:08.415 --> 30:09.851
Like
a bear-sized raccoon?

30:09.851 --> 30:11.200
Shut up. Come on.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.811
I don't know
this house like that.

30:18.686 --> 30:19.992
It's locked.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.168
This one, too.
Why are all the doors locked?

30:22.168 --> 30:23.865
Let's try this one.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.649
Uh, that one's locked,
too, bruh.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.653
- Well.
- Wait, wait.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.394
Who put that sign
on the door?

30:31.394 --> 30:32.961
That was not there earlier,
you guys.

30:36.486 --> 30:37.923
"Game room."

30:37.923 --> 30:39.707
Probably Morgan and Shawn.

30:39.707 --> 30:40.969
Probably just
came back earlier

30:40.969 --> 30:42.884
and are trying to scare
the shit out of us.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.843
Well, it's not funny.
- They think it's a prank
or something.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.106
- Morgan!
- Yo, Shawn, stop playing.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.455
It's locked, bruh.
It's lock...

30:49.195 --> 30:50.196
No, it ain't.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.416
Come on.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.511
What's this?

31:02.599 --> 31:03.644
Oh, hell no.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.042
So, the lights just come on
when they want to?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.565
That works.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.480
Game room?

31:13.480 --> 31:17.658
Yeah, this is some
Morgan next-level
party-planning shit, right?

31:19.225 --> 31:20.443
They got all the games, too.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.926
Etch A Sketch.
I used to love this.

31:24.926 --> 31:25.927
Oh, hey.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.539
I love Ouija boards.

31:29.539 --> 31:32.107
One time I tried to
summon Gary Coleman
and he was not happy.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.201
Hey, look at this.
It's us from college.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.550
Oh, let me see me.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.726
Um, I found Morgan's
earring earlier.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.033
What? These are
her great grandmother's.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.469
She never takes these off.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.862
Okay, then she's
definitely here then.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.038
See, y'all?
Morgan just fucking with us.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.214
Yeah.
"The Blackening"?

31:52.214 --> 31:54.782
Yo, what is this?
Jim Crow Monopoly?

31:55.870 --> 31:57.741
Whoa.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.047
Uh-uh.
This game got bad vibes.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.788
No. No, thank you.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.616
Yeah, Morgan would not
plan some stupid shit
like this, bruh.

32:02.616 --> 32:03.922
Nah, she wouldn't.

32:10.798 --> 32:11.799
King,

32:13.366 --> 32:15.150
I think this must be yours.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.979
- It's a crown.
That makes sense.
- Huh.

32:17.979 --> 32:21.374
- A purse. That's fitting.
- Nnamdi.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.203
- A pyramid? Why's that fitting?
- Because, nigga, you're
literally from Africa.

32:26.814 --> 32:27.902
Shanika.

32:28.816 --> 32:29.948
Why I gotta get a bottle?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.688
Because you're
literally a drunk.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.690
So, wait, they made one
of these specifically
for each of us?

32:33.690 --> 32:35.127
Yeah, I guess.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.349
No, no, no,
what are you doing?

32:40.349 --> 32:42.047
We literally came
all this way to party

32:42.047 --> 32:44.266
and play games,
so that's what I'm doing.

32:44.266 --> 32:48.357
Oh, come on, this is
clearly Morgan's work.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.272
I am not even tripping.
Let's just play.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.621
Yeah,
I'm with Allison.

32:51.621 --> 32:52.709
Everybody falling
for this fake creepiness,

32:52.709 --> 32:53.884
but I'mma beat her
at her own game.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.799
Yeah, Morgan, I see you.
Game on, bitch.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.150
I guess.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.325
All right, let's get it.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.848
Yeah, let's get it.

33:02.415 --> 33:05.505
So, I guess the question is
how do we play?

33:05.505 --> 33:07.333
Ask the little
racist nigga here.

33:07.333 --> 33:10.118
Pick a card
and save Morgan.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.992
The hell?
What it mean
"save Morgan"?

33:25.220 --> 33:27.005
- Shit. It's locked.
- That's not funny, King.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.312
See, that makes me
nervous, and I throw up
when I'm nervous.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.140
- Move, King.
Maybe it's a push.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.663
Talking about
it's locked.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.665
Your ass couldn't open it,
that's why.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.058
If you just, um...

33:37.058 --> 33:39.147
Did you try pushing it?
I think you should push.

33:39.147 --> 33:40.279
You just jerk it off.
There you go.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.410
Nigga, kill yourself.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.197
- Y'all, it's locked.
- See? See, I told you.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.199
- This is why I don't
go to fucking cabins...
- I'm about to snap.

33:47.199 --> 33:50.028
Everyone, calm down
so we can figure out
what's going on.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.301
Wait, what the...

34:05.565 --> 34:07.741
Oh, God, no.
Is that Morgan?

34:07.741 --> 34:11.440
- Oh, no, Morgan.
- Oh, my God.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.225
Y'all, we gotta get
the fuck up outta here.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.878
Oh, my God, Morgan!

34:14.878 --> 34:18.012
Allison, you're gonna have
to shut the hell up!

34:18.012 --> 34:19.360
I'm sorry.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.103
Please...

34:23.670 --> 34:27.282
Lisa, Nnamdi,
Allison, Dewayne,

34:27.282 --> 34:29.806
Shanika, King, Clifton.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.243
It said
our names, y'all.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.766
This shit is
"personal" personal.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.114
How the fuck is
it doing this?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.943
The rules are simple.
Answer correctly

34:35.943 --> 34:38.424
before the second hand
completes one revolution,

34:38.424 --> 34:39.686
you move a space.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.643
If you answer
10 questions correctly,

34:41.643 --> 34:43.733
she lives
and you're all free to go.

34:43.733 --> 34:45.866
Get one wrong, she dies.

34:47.346 --> 34:50.349
Oh, my God, guys, look.
There is someone with her.

34:53.221 --> 34:56.790
Refuse to play, and you die,
just like Shawn did.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.183
Oh, shit!

34:58.183 --> 35:00.010
No! Shawn.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.100
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.537
- Fuck.
Now, what?

35:04.537 --> 35:07.148
Well, guys,
I'm scared, too,

35:07.148 --> 35:11.152
uh, but the voice
made it very clear.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.329
We have an opportunity
to save Morgan,

35:14.329 --> 35:16.940
so why don't we just
play the game?

35:16.940 --> 35:18.464
So, shall we begin?

35:23.338 --> 35:24.774
I think we have
to play the game.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.826
Pick a card.

35:37.396 --> 35:40.660
Okay. "Question one.
Who's Sojourner Truth?

35:40.660 --> 35:43.445
"A: An abolitionist,
and women's rights activist.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.099
"B: An entrepreneur.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.971
"Or C: Harriet Tubman.
Right answer or death."

35:47.971 --> 35:49.538
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.453
So, he just gon' force us
to do a Black history test?

35:51.453 --> 35:53.151
I don't understand.
Why make us play this game?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.717
If you just gonna kill us,
just kill us.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.284
Shut the fuck up, Dewayne.

46:00.105 --> 46:01.541
Girl, how the fuck
did this happen?

46:01.541 --> 46:03.543
I was trying to help King.

46:03.543 --> 46:05.023
Hey, babe, she's gonna need
something to wrap that.

He was just some stranger
on Twitter.

46:23.215 --> 46:24.433
He was mad at me
because I said

46:24.433 --> 46:26.131
that the O'Reilly Auto Parts
theme song

46:26.131 --> 46:28.916
was more culturally relevant
than the Star-Spangled Banner.

- Are you sure?

46:41.276 --> 46:44.584
The outcome of this situation
depends on your participation.

46:44.584 --> 46:45.672
Wait, what are you doing?

46:45.672 --> 46:47.239
Well, we gotta
finish the game.

46:47.239 --> 46:49.763
- No, we don't.
- I would suggest you
pick a card.

46:49.763 --> 46:51.721
You heard what he said.
Girl, pick a card.

46:54.333 --> 46:55.725
"In your predicament,

46:55.725 --> 46:57.597
"the Black character is
always the first to die.

46:57.597 --> 47:01.514
"I will spare your lives
if you sacrifice the person

47:01.514 --> 47:02.950
"you deem the Blackest to me."

47:02.950 --> 47:03.951
The Blackest?

47:05.344 --> 47:06.998
"Choose someone to sacrifice.

47:06.998 --> 47:09.304
"You don't play my game,
you all die.
You have two minutes."

47:09.304 --> 47:11.741
No, we're not playing
the fucking game. We're done.

47:11.741 --> 47:14.179
You have 2 minutes
to decide.

47:16.311 --> 47:17.835
It don't even make sense,
"the Blackest."

47:17.835 --> 47:19.227
That is so subjective.

47:19.227 --> 47:20.707
Well, shit, Shanika.
She say "Nigga" the most.

47:20.707 --> 47:22.709
- Nigga!
- See?

47:22.709 --> 47:24.754
Well, someone has to
get picked or we all end up
like Morgan and Shawn.

47:24.754 --> 47:27.061
All right, look,
nobody should judge anybody
in here, bruh.

47:27.061 --> 47:28.323
I know you ain't over here
trying to argue about

47:28.323 --> 47:30.499
who should be
the Blackest here, Nnamdi.

47:30.499 --> 47:34.155
- What, why?
- Because you are
a literal African, Nnamdi.

47:34.155 --> 47:36.375
You are, like, still in its
original packaging Black.

47:36.375 --> 47:39.291
I'm sorry, boo, but on paper,
you the Blackest.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.032
First of all,
I'm from Oakland, all right,

47:41.032 --> 47:42.207
and my daddy's
from South Africa.

47:42.207 --> 47:44.383
So, Townbiz,
Raider Nation, Go A's,

47:44.383 --> 47:46.472
Michael B. Jordan, Fruitvale
Stationoff top, bruh.

47:46.472 --> 47:47.603
Mmm. That just
makes you Blacker.

47:47.603 --> 47:49.214
Mmm-hmm.

47:49.214 --> 47:50.737
But if anybody is
the Blackest here,

47:50.737 --> 47:53.174
it's African diaspora,
Angela Rye head ass over here.

47:53.174 --> 47:55.698
- Wow, Nnamdi, really?
- Yeah!

47:55.698 --> 47:57.613
Okay. So,
that's what we doing?

47:57.613 --> 47:59.877
Because every single time
one of y'all make a joke,

47:59.877 --> 48:02.575
it's always,
"Oh, Allison, you White this.
Allison, you White that."

48:02.575 --> 48:05.534
But now, when it is
the most convenient for you,

48:05.534 --> 48:06.796
you wanna use my Blackness?

48:06.796 --> 48:08.973
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely not, nigga.

48:08.973 --> 48:11.453
Because guess what?
If we playing this game,

48:11.453 --> 48:15.066
my daddy is White with "wha",
so it's surely not me.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.546
- King?
- King?

48:17.546 --> 48:19.548
- Yeah, King.
- 'Cause you the one with the gun
and you gangsta.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.899
I'm a ex-gangsta, all right?
I changed my life.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.248
And I'm married
to a White woman, so...

48:23.248 --> 48:25.467
- That does not help.
- You right. I'mma shut up.

48:25.467 --> 48:26.642
90 seconds.

48:26.642 --> 48:28.340
Oh, my God,
this is not working.

48:28.340 --> 48:30.124
I'mma need so much therapy
if we get through this.

48:30.124 --> 48:31.647
What about Dewayne?

48:31.647 --> 48:33.911
Girl, shut your ass up.
Did you not hear
what I said?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.869
Therapy.
Black people don't do therapy.

48:35.869 --> 48:37.740
Well, actually, Black people are
slowly but surely

48:37.740 --> 48:39.655
adopting healthier
mental health lifestyles.

48:39.655 --> 48:41.092
Hey, big fucking deal.

48:41.092 --> 48:42.571
No, deadass, big fucking deal.

48:42.571 --> 48:43.964
We've come a long way.
It's a beautiful thing.

48:43.964 --> 48:45.705
- Yeah.
- We have.

48:45.705 --> 48:47.925
But that's not the point.
The point is
y'all can't pick me.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.056
- I'm gay.

48:49.056 --> 48:50.753
Nigga, you always
using that shit.

48:50.753 --> 48:52.886
No, no. And just like
my homophobic family member says,

48:52.886 --> 48:56.020
"Gayness is just whiteness
wrapped up in a bunch of dicks,"
and today, I agree.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.108
"Bunch of dicks"?

48:57.108 --> 48:58.457
70 seconds left.

48:58.457 --> 49:00.546
- Look, we gotta pick somebody.
- We can't.

49:00.546 --> 49:02.113
You know what?
What about Clifton?

49:02.113 --> 49:03.766
Yeah, why we can't
pick his little weak-ass?

49:03.766 --> 49:05.638
You over there
quiet in the corner,

49:05.638 --> 49:08.032
but you did not get invited
to this event,
but yet you showed up.

49:08.032 --> 49:09.381
That is some Black shit, nigga.

49:09.381 --> 49:10.817
Blackity Black, bro.

49:10.817 --> 49:14.038
Guys,
I was invited by Morgan.

49:14.038 --> 49:16.170
- How?
- 60 seconds.

49:16.170 --> 49:17.693
Morgan sent me an e-vite.

49:19.739 --> 49:21.610
Guys, I can prove
I'm not the Blackest.

49:21.610 --> 49:23.003
- Prove it.

49:23.003 --> 49:25.353
- I've never seen Friday.
- What the fuck?

49:25.353 --> 49:28.313
I thought Black Twitter
was a type of seasoning.

49:28.313 --> 49:32.143
Um, I like Jimmy Fallon
without The Roots.

49:32.143 --> 49:34.101
- That's wrong.
- Um...

49:34.101 --> 49:37.235
Beyonce's Super Bowl performance
made me unsafe.

49:37.235 --> 49:38.410
Same.

49:39.585 --> 49:41.630
- I voted for Trump.

49:41.630 --> 49:42.892
- What?
- What?

49:44.807 --> 49:46.287
- Twice.

49:46.287 --> 49:49.987
Stop. Stop. Stop.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.901
Get your hands... Stop!

49:51.901 --> 49:54.121
We have a minute left.
Somebody trying to kill us,

49:54.121 --> 49:56.297
and arguing is only
gonna make it easier.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.039
We need a plan.

50:00.519 --> 50:03.913
Our ancestors did not die
for us to abandon each other,

50:03.913 --> 50:07.787
our morals and our Blackness
at the moment's notice
in the face of adversity.

50:11.443 --> 50:15.403
Boy, I know you did not just go
into some complete,
dramatic-ass monologue

50:15.403 --> 50:17.666
when you knew
we only had one minute left.

50:17.666 --> 50:19.103
Time is almost out.

50:19.103 --> 50:21.453
Girl, you talking
just as long as me. Shit.

50:21.453 --> 50:23.020
20 seconds.

50:23.020 --> 50:26.588
Look, y'all, we just need
to pick somebody, all right.

50:26.588 --> 50:29.287
And I'm sorry, Clifton,
for that dumb-ass shit that
you just said, I pick you, bruh.

50:29.287 --> 50:31.854
- No.
- I pick your MAGA ass, too.

50:31.854 --> 50:34.248
-  No.
- Allison?

50:35.162 --> 50:36.903
I vote for Clifton.

50:36.903 --> 50:38.731
- King?
- This nigga.

50:39.297 --> 50:40.298
Bae.

50:42.474 --> 50:44.041
Bae.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.739
I mean, I guess
I don't have a choice.
I pick Clifton.

50:47.522 --> 50:48.567
Dewayne?

50:48.567 --> 50:49.959
5 seconds.

50:51.526 --> 50:52.832
I'm so sorry, Clifton.

50:53.963 --> 50:55.748
- I pick you.

50:55.748 --> 50:57.706
- Your time is up.
- Wow.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.623
You know, I really thought
we connected.

51:01.623 --> 51:03.408
You know, if you guys
had any more sense,

51:03.408 --> 51:05.932
you'd know that
this is what the game
wanted us to do.

51:05.932 --> 51:08.369
To turn on each other.
To act like animals.

51:09.501 --> 51:10.980
You gave it what it wanted.

51:13.766 --> 51:16.160
- All right.
- Nigga!

51:28.041 --> 51:29.390
All lives matter.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.505
- Oh!

51:59.420 --> 52:01.335
- That didn't feel right.
- I'll go get him.

52:07.428 --> 52:08.386
It's locked again.

52:21.790 --> 52:23.227
Do you like Hunger Games?

52:23.227 --> 52:26.926
I love the books
but you probably don't
even read.

52:26.926 --> 52:30.843
Uh, maybe we can talk this out,
you know. Um...

52:30.843 --> 52:31.887
Dang it.

52:47.729 --> 52:48.730
Fuck.

52:52.038 --> 52:53.082
Oh, my God.

52:54.519 --> 52:55.737
Oh, no.

53:04.877 --> 53:08.097
Well, I mean,
he did vote for Trump.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.754
- Twice.
Oh, my God,
is it over?

53:12.754 --> 53:15.453
You did not follow the rules.
Clifton did not vote.

53:15.453 --> 53:17.194
Space revoked. Pick a card.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.239
What?
- Oh, my God, this game
is impossible to win.

53:19.239 --> 53:21.198
- No. Hell, no!
- You have time

53:21.198 --> 53:22.503
- to save yourself.
- I'm not playing this fucking
game anymore, man.

53:22.503 --> 53:23.591
You have to save yourself.
Save yourself...

53:28.814 --> 53:30.772
So, you don't want to play?

53:30.772 --> 53:32.818
We refuse.
No more fucking games.

53:32.818 --> 53:36.387
That would mean
you automatically move
into sudden death.

53:36.387 --> 53:37.866
- Sudden death?
- What?

53:37.866 --> 53:40.956
The rules are simple. Survive.

53:40.956 --> 53:42.915
The door to the game room
is open.

53:45.004 --> 53:46.745
You'll have 3 minutes of safety

53:46.745 --> 53:49.400
before I open
the rest of the doors
in the house.

53:49.400 --> 53:53.839
Now, are your chances better
outside or in?

53:53.839 --> 53:57.582
You must choose
or face the consequences.

53:57.582 --> 53:59.671
Ugh. I hate this bitch's voice!

53:59.671 --> 54:00.802
3 minutes.

54:03.022 --> 54:05.416
- So, what do we do?
- What do you mean,
"What do we do," girl?

54:05.416 --> 54:07.592
I'm not gonna stay
in this fucking mouse trap.

54:07.592 --> 54:09.289
We got to get the hell up
out of here.

54:09.289 --> 54:10.725
Why? So he can just
attack us outside?

54:10.725 --> 54:14.120
Look, Clifton was right.
This game has rules,

54:14.120 --> 54:17.079
and whatever the hell they are,
they have stuck by them, okay?

54:17.079 --> 54:20.605
So, if we really do have
3 minutes y'all,
we should just run.

54:20.605 --> 54:22.346
I agree. We got more room
to run outside.

54:22.346 --> 54:24.217
We stay here,
we just sitting ducks.

54:24.217 --> 54:26.915
I don't know about you
but I have no interest
in getting hunt down

54:26.915 --> 54:28.613
in the woods
by that psycho!

54:28.613 --> 54:30.702
Look, I'm with Allison.
We need to take
our fucking chances.

54:30.702 --> 54:32.486
Let's go, baby, listen.
We can cut across the woods

54:32.486 --> 54:33.748
and make it to the other
side of the road.

54:33.748 --> 54:35.359
If we all make it,
then we'll all be safe.

54:35.359 --> 54:37.186
What movies have you seen?
'Cause that's fucking stupid.

54:37.186 --> 54:38.405
Bruh, I haven't watched
any movies.

54:38.405 --> 54:39.537
I'm just trying to save
my girl!

54:42.104 --> 54:43.280
Boo, I love you.
Why you yelling at me?

54:43.280 --> 54:44.890
Listen, arguing is not
gon' help us.

54:44.890 --> 54:46.761
Everybody, let's go
at least get some
fucking weapons.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.894
All right.
- Are you kidding me?

54:48.894 --> 54:50.199
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:50.199 --> 54:51.592
Somebody gon' help me
the fuck up?

54:51.592 --> 54:52.724
Shit, my bad, bruh.

54:54.726 --> 54:57.642
Y'all better
come in this kitchen and
find something. Shit.

54:57.642 --> 54:58.991
Hey, find some weapons.

54:59.948 --> 55:01.036
Look for something sharp.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.651
- Here. Use these.
- Thanks.

55:06.651 --> 55:09.262
Wait. Chili powder?
Girl, what I'm finna do, cook?

55:09.262 --> 55:10.872
Sorry, girl,
we ran out of knives.

55:10.872 --> 55:13.527
Really? A candlestick?
You think you in Clue?

55:13.527 --> 55:15.573
Don't start with me.
I could fuck somebody
up with this.

55:15.573 --> 55:17.226
What are you gonna do?
Tenderize his ass?

55:17.226 --> 55:19.098
At least it's metal,
Colonel Mustard.
That looks plastic.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.926
At least this just has
a little weight to it.
It has some girth.

55:20.926 --> 55:22.275
Shanika, I need
some of them painkillers.

55:25.104 --> 55:27.106
I got you now. Here you go.

55:30.718 --> 55:32.285
- This is Adderall.
- What?

55:32.285 --> 55:33.634
This is Adderall.

55:38.770 --> 55:40.554
- Is this what you gave her?
- Yes.

55:40.554 --> 55:41.599
I need something else.

55:43.818 --> 55:45.342
Here, you can take this. Vicodin.

55:46.473 --> 55:47.866
- I'm going.
- Whoa, what?

55:47.866 --> 55:49.302
No, you supposed to
be dead, bruh.

55:49.302 --> 55:50.782
This ain't that movie.

55:50.782 --> 55:52.131
Look, man, let's go
before this Vicodin wear off.

55:52.131 --> 55:54.916
Wait, are you crazy?
Look at yourself.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.353
- I got shot once.
- Twice!

55:56.353 --> 55:58.224
In the same spot.
One hole.

55:59.660 --> 56:01.619
It hurt like hell,
but I can run. My legs work.

56:01.619 --> 56:03.185
All right.
You can come with us,

56:03.185 --> 56:04.839
but if you start lagging,
we ain't carrying your ass.

56:04.839 --> 56:06.145
- Fine.
- Shit, look y'all.

56:06.145 --> 56:07.668
It's real dark out there
and I'm still high.

56:07.668 --> 56:09.757
- I can't go out there.
- Me, too, I'm staying.

56:09.757 --> 56:11.280
- Lisa!
- Baby, then I'm staying
with you.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.065
No, it's okay.
I understand if you
have to leave.

56:13.065 --> 56:14.762
- Yeah, go.
- Baby, I don't wanna stay...

56:14.762 --> 56:16.677
I wanna stay with you.
I wanna show you
that I'm committed.

56:16.677 --> 56:18.853
- Look, we a "us" now.
- This Larenz Tate chasing
the train ass nigga.

56:18.853 --> 56:20.551
Not now, Nnamdi.

56:20.551 --> 56:22.553
- I'm boots for
Nina ass, nigga.

56:22.553 --> 56:24.250
Okay, we all know
what this means.

56:24.250 --> 56:26.513
- Don't you dare, Allison.
- I'mma say it.

56:26.513 --> 56:27.732
Don't say this dumb shit.

56:27.732 --> 56:30.169
- We...
- Allison.

56:30.169 --> 56:32.301
- We...
- Oh, my God.

56:33.302 --> 56:34.347
We have to split up.

56:34.347 --> 56:36.828
- Oh, my God!
- Why?

56:36.828 --> 56:38.830
He's not gon' be
in two places at once.

56:38.830 --> 56:40.440
Oh, see, Allison.
I knew you was gonna
say that shit

56:40.440 --> 56:42.094
but I figured that was
just your White side talking.

56:42.094 --> 56:44.270
This is not
my White half talking, Nnamdi.

56:44.270 --> 56:47.665
This is me talking
as a whole-ass Black person,

56:47.665 --> 56:49.362
who just so happens
to be biracial.

56:49.362 --> 56:51.190
My "Blackness" should not be
in question

56:51.190 --> 56:53.758
just because
I am simply suggesting

56:53.758 --> 56:56.282
that separating
might actually help us
stay alive.

56:56.282 --> 56:57.936
Allison, yes,
you do have a point.

56:57.936 --> 56:59.981
But do you really think
your Black side did them
air quotes?

56:59.981 --> 57:01.418
That feels
exclusively Caucasian.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.593
20 seconds left!

57:04.595 --> 57:05.683
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

57:05.683 --> 57:07.249
- Stay alive.
- Mmm-hmm.

57:07.249 --> 57:09.991
Shanika, run them pills, girl.
They good.

57:11.384 --> 57:13.255
I don't know how much
time we have,

57:13.255 --> 57:14.561
but if the door does open,

57:14.561 --> 57:16.650
this is the one closest
to the woods.

57:16.650 --> 57:19.044
I didn't know
that a psycho killer
in blackface

57:19.044 --> 57:20.524
was gonna be
the person that was here

57:20.524 --> 57:23.091
when I asked who all
was gonna be here?

57:23.091 --> 57:26.181
This feels like
the end of Set it Off.

57:26.181 --> 57:28.357
I hate this,
it feels so sad.

57:29.010 --> 57:30.229
You are my sister.

57:31.709 --> 57:32.797
My strength.

57:32.797 --> 57:34.538
- And my pride.
- And my pride.

57:46.419 --> 57:47.464
It'll be all right.

58:02.174 --> 58:03.175
Okay, we good.

58:04.002 --> 58:05.003
Bye, y'all.

58:26.111 --> 58:27.634
Hey, yo.
We should hide.

58:28.809 --> 58:29.854
Wait.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.598
No, no, no.
I don't wanna go
in the basement.

58:34.598 --> 58:36.556
I don't wanna
see Morgan like that.

58:36.556 --> 58:37.644
Hey, baby, I'm with Dewayne.
I don't wanna see her
like that, either.

58:37.644 --> 58:39.472
I'm going
to find Morgan.

58:53.312 --> 58:54.661
Yo! When did we become
the kind of people

58:54.661 --> 58:56.533
that walk
into dark-ass basements?

58:56.533 --> 58:57.838
Nice of you
to join me.

59:02.364 --> 59:05.716
Is that a well?
What kind of house is this?

59:05.716 --> 59:08.240
Shit. I'm impressed.
Motherfucker's crazy.

59:16.248 --> 59:17.597
Wait, wait, wait.

59:17.597 --> 59:19.294
What? The road is that way.

59:19.294 --> 59:22.036
No, no, no.
The road is this way.
The lake is that way.

59:22.036 --> 59:23.168
What?

59:27.607 --> 59:28.869
What the fuck is you doing?

59:28.869 --> 59:32.481
Okay, hold up,
I feel weird as shit!

59:32.481 --> 59:34.483
Okay, I think I need to stop.

59:34.483 --> 59:38.052
Guys, just go.
I'm just gonna sit here
with my feelings.

59:38.052 --> 59:40.098
Your feelings? What?

59:40.098 --> 59:43.275
Allison, that Adderall got you
bugging the fuck out.

59:43.275 --> 59:45.233
Come on, Allison.
We not finna
leave you here.

59:45.233 --> 59:47.322
No, just go.

59:47.322 --> 59:49.107
Look, I need you to breathe
with me, all right?

59:49.107 --> 59:52.023
Inhale, exhale.

59:54.460 --> 59:55.853
There's a crazy motherfucker
out here

59:55.853 --> 59:57.158
hunting us like we animals.

59:57.158 --> 59:58.812
This ain't the time
to be sitting down.

59:58.812 --> 01:00:00.422
I need you to be strong.

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:02.294
You got Rosa Parks
on your shirt, right?

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:04.035
Would she be
sitting down right now?

01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:06.994
I mean,
that's exactly what she did.

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:09.388
Man, nigga, shut up!
Look at me.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:12.434
If you wanna be somebody
and if you wanna go somewhere,

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:14.523
then you better wake up and...

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:16.482
- Pay attention.
- That's right, bitch.

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:18.005
Now, come on
with your injured ass.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:29.277
Oh, my God.

01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:31.366
Please tell me
that's some of King's Kool-Ayyy.

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:32.933
We both know
what that is, man.

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:35.327
Okay.

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:38.069
- Go. Shit.
- Look, you go.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.822
Okay,
but where's Morgan?

01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:54.781
Let's see if we can figure out

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:56.653
how this fucker operates
before he gets back.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:17.848
Oh, my God.
There are cameras
all over this house.

01:01:17.848 --> 01:01:20.372
He's been watching
our every move this entire time.

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:24.811
Y'all, look.

01:01:27.118 --> 01:01:29.337
I thought we were
above the Mason-Dixon.

01:01:29.337 --> 01:01:31.818
- What was that?

01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:34.299
Fucking 'course, he'd go after
the darkest people first.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.389
- We gotta go back upstairs.
- Really?

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.173
Okay.

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:45.658
Fuck! No.
We went the wrong way.

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:48.661
See? Allison,
I told you. Allison?

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:51.011
Allison!
Fuck, where is she?

01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:53.144
Her ass probably high.

01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:54.798
I don't blame her.
I wanna do the same thing.

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:57.757
No, King, you gotta
stay with me, okay?

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.759
Look, I can see houses
in the distance.

01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:02.544
Okay, I'mma swim across.
They won't suspect it.

01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:04.459
They probably assume
we can't swim anyway.

01:02:04.459 --> 01:02:06.331
They be assuming right,
'cause I can't.

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:08.725
- Wow! Way to be
a fucking stereotype.
- You know what? You go ahead

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.640
and hop your little privileged
ass in that dark,
mysterious water,

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.903
I'mma climb up this tree.

01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:14.252
You give me a signal
when you get across.

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:15.949
Is that something
you can even do?

01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:17.908
I ran from cops,
I dodged bullets,

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:20.084
I jumped gates.
This is easy, all right?

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:22.390
Oh, shit.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.870
This is really embarrassing.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.959
- Get up and help me,
God damn it!
- Nigga, come on.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:27.787
Don't put your finger
in my asshole.

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:35.926
- Wasn't this door open?
- It don't even matter, yo.
We gon' go straight through.

01:02:37.492 --> 01:02:38.493
Ready?

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:44.456
Nigga, move,
I'll go first. Okay.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:46.023
Here we go.

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:48.939
Okay, I see
why you didn't wanna go first.

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:50.723
Oh, my God, are you guys
fucking line dancing?

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:52.333
Wait, hold on.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.379
One, two...

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.210
I heard screaming.
Is everything okay?

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.039
Ranger White? Is that you?

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:04.781
- In the flesh.
- Oh, shit.
Is this good or bad?

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.783
Wait. How do we know
we can trust him?

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:10.308
No offense.

01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:12.876
- I'm one of the good ones.
- That does not help.
They all say that.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.791
That actually makes you
seem more suspicious.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.141
You can trust me. Seriously.

01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.795
If I got an invite
to the cookout,

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.274
I'd be honored,
but I wouldn't go.

01:03:20.274 --> 01:03:22.015
- And why the fuck not?
- Because I know my presence

01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:23.712
in an all-Black space
would be a disturbance

01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:25.018
and undo it
being an all-Black space.

01:03:26.237 --> 01:03:27.847
That's a pretty good answer.

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:29.066
- I'm sold.
- Mmm-hmm. Works for me.

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.633
Look, we're gonna
lower our hands.

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.244
- Lower away.
- Okay, great.

01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:35.028
Look, I've never been so happy
to see a White savior.

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:36.551
Somebody's trying to kill us.
Please help us. Please.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:38.249
Whoa. Slow down.

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:39.728
A masked killer is after us
and two of our friends are dead.

01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:40.860
- What do you mean dead?
- Dead.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.383
Dead, meet your maker
dead, dead.

01:03:42.383 --> 01:03:43.645
- Where are the rest
of your friends?
- We split up.

01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:45.125
You split up?
But you all are Black.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:47.345
- Whoa. Do not get comfortable.
- I know you didn't.

01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:49.216
- Bold move, bro.
- Sorry.

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:50.652
Don't you need to call
for help or something?

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:52.698
Okay, try to calm down.
I'll get some help.

01:03:52.698 --> 01:03:55.266
- This is White to base.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:57.572
White to base.
This is White.

01:03:58.791 --> 01:03:59.836
White.

01:04:00.662 --> 01:04:01.707
White.

01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:06.843
That's weird.
Runs on a satellite system,
should always work.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.105
The signal is
actively being blocked.

01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:09.280
That's why we couldn't call out.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.542
You gotta believe us.

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:12.936
Come with me.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:21.945
All right, get in quick.

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:22.946
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:32.738 --> 01:04:33.957
I'll be right back.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.480
Lock the doors, get down,
and don't worry.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.134
Dude, where are you...
Can we just go?

01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:40.093
- Where are you going?
- Where is he going?

01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:42.487
Why White people always gotta go
where they shouldn't go?

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:56.196
What?

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.070
Nigga, are you shooting
arrows at me?

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:03.116
No! Hey!

01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:05.597
Hey! Stop it! Stop!

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.358
King! Stop!

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:31.536
Let's see what you got
without that bitch-ass crossbow.

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:33.146
What's up? What's up?

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:36.106
Come on.

01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:39.413
Fuck! I'm gonna beat
your little ass now.

01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:41.981
- Aw, hell,
you can't even fight?

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.418
- What?
- What's good?

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:54.211
Get your bitch ass up.
This one's for Morgan.

01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:57.344
- Oh! Cramp! Shit.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:03.829
Don't hurt my...
Nigga, you can't fucking...

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.965
Time out. Time out.

01:06:10.444 --> 01:06:11.489
Oh, fuck!

01:06:15.841 --> 01:06:18.975
Hey! Stop it!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.021
First off, you're gonna watch me
kill your friend.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:28.332
- No, no, no...
Hey!

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.030
Asshole.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.860
Well, come and have a go.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.910
All right, bitch. Let's do this.

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:48.178
- Hell, yeah.

01:06:58.492 --> 01:07:01.017
Beat his motherfucking ass!
Hell, yeah!

01:07:04.194 --> 01:07:06.239
Goddamn, beat your ass now.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.421
Oh, shit.

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:20.471
Nigga.

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:31.047
You sure he's not gonna
come back to life?

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.571
- No, girl, he's dead.
- Hell yeah, you beat
that nigga ass.

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:43.233
That's the one-eyed nigga
I saw at the store.

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:44.538
Hell yeah, run his pockets.

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:46.149
What the hell?

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:51.806
Wait a minute.
He's got asthma.

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.852
That's why he was breathing
like that.

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:56.768
Camden Conner. 555 Valley Lane.

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.813
That's our address.

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:00.815
Hey, I feel a bit woozy here.

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.165
See, this why
I don't come to the woods

01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:04.080
because of crazy
White motherfuckers like this.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.865
And they always got
some dirty-ass shoes on.

01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:09.781
Wait, the nigga that was
chasing us in the house

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:11.087
had a different pair
of boots on.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:13.306
Remember?
I stabbed him in the foot.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:15.526
So, unless this motherfucker got
costume changes...

01:08:15.526 --> 01:08:19.138
That means that
there's more than one of them.

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:21.401
- We gotta warn the others.
- Okay.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:23.403
Oh, fuck.
- King!

01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:26.885
Okay, look, y'all, we...

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:29.322
we might actually make it
out of this, okay?

01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:32.978
If he comes back. Why the fuck
is he looking for the killer?
Can we just go?

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:34.501
Oh, my God.

01:08:36.023 --> 01:08:38.331
Maybe to convince us
that the killer isn't him?

01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:40.464
What the fuck?
- We gotta go.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:50.300
Stop. Stop pressing the button.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.779
Both of y'all,
stop fucking with the door!

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.957
Shit.
Ah, shit!

01:08:58.656 --> 01:09:00.832
Unlock the door.
I don't think I stopped him.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.747
He's coming. Unlock the door
and let me in. Quick.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.185
I know how that looks,

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:10.058
but I found that mask
in the woods close to here.

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:11.755
It's why I came to check on you.

01:09:11.755 --> 01:09:14.411
Let me help you.
You have to trust me.

01:09:15.716 --> 01:09:17.718
- No, we don't.
- Let me in!

01:09:17.718 --> 01:09:19.764
Let me in!

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:30.949
Come on, man. We're sitting
ducks out here, y'all.

01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:32.819
Maybe we should have
trusted him.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:35.258
Okay, he's gonna
reload at some point.
Should we go back in there?

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.693
No. We go back in there
for what?

01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:37.999
What other choice
do we have?

01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:39.827
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't... Fuck!

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:43.179
Okay, now!

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.657
Go, go, go!

01:09:44.657 --> 01:09:45.658
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:47.574 --> 01:09:49.140
Oh, shit. He's shooting!

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.490
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:51.883
Oh.

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:56.103
Just go.
Save yourself.

01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:58.281
Go.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:09:59.934
- We can't...
- Let's go.

01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:04.374
I was joking. Shit!

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:26.004
We just left him.
What if he's
just somewhere bleeding?

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:28.528
No, baby, he told us,
he told us to leave him.

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:29.877
He didn't mean it.

01:10:33.054 --> 01:10:34.708
Okay, Lis, look.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:36.362
All of us ain't gonna
make it through the night.

01:10:36.362 --> 01:10:37.537
We know that, right?

01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:42.150
- I'm just saying.
- I'm gonna go get my friend.

01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.307
Who's playing music?

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:56.137
Wait.

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:03.797
You shady motherfuckers
left me to die!

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:05.799
And I just saved y'all asses.
But fuck me, though, right?

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:06.974
You told us to leave you.

01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:09.063
Nigga, you know
I didn't mean that shit.

01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:11.022
- Told you.
- Told you, my ass.

01:12:11.022 --> 01:12:12.763
- You didn't have to follow him.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.680
Move! Let me get up there.

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:24.905
How long do y'all think
we should wait in here?

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:26.516
I don't know.
Probably till morning?

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:28.169
The fucker a vampire
or something?

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.562
- Why the fuck
is morning more better?
- I don't know.

01:12:29.562 --> 01:12:30.955
'Cause it's bright out
and less scary.

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:34.393
That makes sense.

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:37.135
I'm sorry we left you,
but it's not every day

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:39.790
I'm faced with fucking life
or death decisions.

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:42.487
It's good to know
when it comes to me,
the decision is death.

01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.490
What is your problem?

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.884
You've been pressed
this entire trip.

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:49.277
If you have something to say,
say it.
No time like the present.

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.410
I disagree.
There is a better time
than the present,

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:53.673
- and it is not right now.
- Every time this nigga
broke your heart,

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:55.196
I was the one
there to mend it.

01:12:55.196 --> 01:12:57.764
I never asked you to do that.
You chose to do that.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.684
Fuck. What the fuck.

01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:10.386
Oh, my God.
Keke Palmer retweeted my tweet.

01:13:11.648 --> 01:13:12.910
Okay, okay, okay.

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.669
- Keep that shit together?
- I'm trying.

01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:37.237
Oh, shit.

01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:45.029
- Peekaboo.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.459
Shit.

01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:32.946
I'm going to jail.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:35.601
Oh, shit, are you okay?
He kicked the shit outta you.

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.168
How'd you know
how to do that?

01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:40.519
Yeah, bro, that seems like
an exclusively White weapon.

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:43.261
You know what,
that's another thing. Y'all are
always underestimating me.

01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:44.654
Maybe that's why
you left me at the car.

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:45.829
This is exactly
why I didn't tell you

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:47.221
me and Nnamdi
were back together.

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:48.875
I just didn't need
this negativity.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:50.702
Oh, no, no, no...
You didn't tell me
about Nnamdi

01:14:50.702 --> 01:14:52.487
- because you are ashamed.
- Ashamed?

01:14:54.184 --> 01:14:55.752
Be real.
You have always
used my friendship

01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:57.971
as some fucked up replacement
as a rebound guy

01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:00.191
whenever y'all broke up
because it was safe.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:01.452
You knew I would be there.

01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:03.020
I feel like
I wasted my fucking time.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.934
'Cause look at you now,
you got your man,
your house,

01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:06.980
and I'm pushed
to the curb, again.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.591
You have never treated me
like a best friend.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:10.680
You've treated me
like a gay side chick.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.031
You leaving me and picking him
proves exactly that.

01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:25.782
- That's a good shot.
- That was the last one.

01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:29.219
Oh, you're gonna
pay for that, bitch.

01:15:29.219 --> 01:15:31.614
- Ooh.
- I got you, bitch. Hey!

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.312
You got
the right one today, bitch.

01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:36.357
That's for
Morgan and Shawn!

01:15:36.357 --> 01:15:37.750
- This is for King.
- His ass.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.012
- That's what you fucking get.
Carlton.

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:41.058
- It's Clifton.
- Why the fuck Black women

01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:43.713
gotta save everyone
all the God damn time?

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.323
- Get him, girl.
- I'm tired.

01:15:45.323 --> 01:15:48.152
I'm tired.
I'm fucking tired.

01:15:50.023 --> 01:15:51.677
See, that's why I married
a White woman.

01:15:51.677 --> 01:15:53.200
Bitch, and suck my dick!

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.507
You're acting just...
I don't think you need to...

01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:58.771
- He good.
- Girl, he dead. It's fine.

01:15:58.771 --> 01:15:59.859
Lisa.

01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:19.662
Earlier, did you have
something to say

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:21.228
about my choice in weapons?

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.275
Oh, no.
No, no, no. Nnamdi?

01:16:24.275 --> 01:16:26.625
No. No. Hell...
Absolutely not.

01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:28.105
Look.

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:35.634
Maybe I was a little worked up

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:38.463
after I realized
what my part was

01:16:38.463 --> 01:16:40.291
in what was wrong with us.

01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:42.772
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
me and Nnamdi
were back together.

01:16:43.816 --> 01:16:46.210
- I love you, okay?
- I love you, too.

01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:53.391
You got guts
all over your face, so.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.049
Um, look, I'm sorry
for pressuring you to commit

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.659
before you were ready.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:02.182
I was worried that
if you kept me waiting
for so long

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:03.662
that I was gonna...

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.838
I'm gonna mess up.
I love you, all right?

01:17:12.932 --> 01:17:15.413
Dewayne, I apologize
to you, too.

01:17:15.413 --> 01:17:18.068
Yeah, I wasn't a good dude
in college. Sorry.

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:19.939
Are y'all for real?
Y'all doing this right now?

01:17:19.939 --> 01:17:21.637
Y'all ain't worked out
y'all shit yet?

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.290
Didn't you see how long
he was talking?

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:24.901
- Why you have to
interrupt my apology?
- Nigga, it's given

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.424
that there's another
motherfucking killer
in the woods

01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:28.339
that we killed.
That's what I'm trying
to tell y'all.

01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:30.036
- Okay, I did not know that.
Yeah, so,
now let's find out

01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:31.734
who this motherfucker is.

01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:34.737
Oh, I can't.
Dewayne, look in his pockets.

01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:38.654
Mmm. Player, you got it.
This is on you.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.743
- You two gonna figure it out!
- Okay, I'mma do it. Fuck!

01:17:54.365 --> 01:17:55.583
Clive Connor.

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:06.550
This look like the other nigga
we saw in the woods.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.903
Who the fuck are they?

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:13.689
We found this shit
on the other one. Read it.

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:15.168
Shit.

01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:16.735
They're twins.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.827
We also found this on him.

01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:25.352
I don't get it.
Someone must
have been paying them.

01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:26.789
Yeah,
that seems about right.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:31.576
They've got
all our initials on here, too.

01:18:31.576 --> 01:18:35.188
So, somebody paid
these evil racist twins
to kill us all. Is that it?

01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:36.407
And this is all we worth?

01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:39.236
It's like $1,000.
This is offensive.

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:40.716
Oh, my God.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.326
We need to get
the fuck outta here.

01:18:42.326 --> 01:18:43.849
No, I'm still
not going out there.

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:45.590
Okay, you know what?
Why don't we just
stay here

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.896
because they've got to come back

01:18:46.896 --> 01:18:48.549
for Ranger White at some point?

01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:50.726
I still need to know
what happened
to Morgan and Shawn.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.728
Yeah. Which means that
they might still be downstairs.

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:56.035
Right. He had
a whole command center
down there, y'all,

01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:58.037
like TVs and everything.
We can use that
to call for help.

01:18:58.037 --> 01:18:59.691
Y'all are acting
real White right now.

01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:01.519
I think
we've already proven ourselves.

01:19:01.519 --> 01:19:03.521
If there's someone else
down there, we'll handle it.

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:07.090
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna stay up here
and just keep watch

01:19:08.612 --> 01:19:11.834
with my eyes. Wait.

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:15.098
I'm sorry.

01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:17.273
When you go down there,
take this.

01:19:17.273 --> 01:19:19.450
- Just in case.
- Okay, thank you.

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:21.103
What the fuck
is wrong with her?

01:19:21.103 --> 01:19:23.846
- Nigga, it's the Adderall.
- I'm on Adderall?

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:25.151
No, baby, you're not on nothing.

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:26.500
- Okay.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.387
Stop yelling. Stop yelling.
Stop yelling.

01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:56.966
I've been thinking,
they keep locking
the doors on us.

01:19:56.966 --> 01:19:58.663
While we got them unlocked,

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.273
maybe we should prop them open,
so they don't keep locking 'em.

01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:02.406
Right. Great idea. Right.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:04.495
I'm just gonna...
We just have to...

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:07.063
- I'm gonna need this one.
- Ouch.

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.804
Hey, Lisa, he's got a note.

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.028
It says,
"You're getting warmer."

01:20:16.028 --> 01:20:17.943
Poor Clifton.

01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:21.380
"Fatal accident claims life
of local nurse
Lateesha Paine, age 29."

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.905
- What?
-"Arrested on the scene,

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:25.733
"Clifton Franklin James

01:20:25.733 --> 01:20:28.127

of alcohol and struck Ms. Paine.

01:20:28.127 --> 01:20:30.347
"Mr. James is to be arraigned
on manslaughter "

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.713
What the hell did he have to do
with this?

01:20:57.287 --> 01:20:58.766
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

01:21:07.079 --> 01:21:08.646
No, no, no.

01:21:08.646 --> 01:21:12.476
I got this whole basement
riddled with plastic explosives.

01:21:12.476 --> 01:21:16.045
Now, one of you guys move
and poof!

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:18.786
So, if you don't mind,
I think I'll give us
some privacy.

01:21:21.093 --> 01:21:23.617
Wait! No! Fuck.

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:27.317
King. Shit. King!
They locked them in.

01:21:27.317 --> 01:21:28.753
So, drop your weapons.

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:31.887
Now!

01:21:35.585 --> 01:21:38.284
And big guy, do you mind
kicking that over to me?

01:21:38.284 --> 01:21:39.851
The crossbow?
Slowly.

01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:43.420
I really appreciate it.

01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.335
Okay.

01:21:46.989 --> 01:21:48.032
This is heavy.

01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:51.950
Okay.

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:54.735
Wait, Clifton,
you did all of this, why?

01:21:54.735 --> 01:21:57.216
I would love
to answer that question, truly.

01:21:57.216 --> 01:21:58.914
But in order to do that,

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.306
you're gonna have to
play my game.

01:22:00.306 --> 01:22:01.786
Hell no.

01:22:01.786 --> 01:22:03.614
No, you don't wanna play?
You don't wanna play?

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:05.355
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on.

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:06.922
Question one.

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:09.620
Why am I doing this?

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.451
Now, listen,

01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:16.366
you should be familiar
with the rules by now.

01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:19.630
It's been a long night.
Right answers only.

01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:21.066
But we don't know.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:22.675
Wrong answer.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.591
Shit!

01:22:26.898 --> 01:22:30.728
So, hey, Dewayne,
the next one won't miss.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:32.643
Gonna ask you
just one more time.

01:22:32.643 --> 01:22:37.778
Question one,
why am I doing this?

01:22:37.778 --> 01:22:40.737
The article about
the girl you killed?

01:22:40.737 --> 01:22:44.175
Ding, ding, ding, ding.
Good job, Lis.

01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:46.352
Good job. All right.

01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:49.702
Per the article, that happened
10 years ago tonight.

01:22:49.702 --> 01:22:51.487
Question two,

01:22:51.487 --> 01:22:55.621
what else happened
10 years ago tonight?

01:22:55.621 --> 01:22:57.842
It was, uh...

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.671
The what? Come on.

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:03.848
The party. It was the party.
It was the Juneteenth party.

01:23:03.848 --> 01:23:05.632
Ding, fucking, ding.

01:23:05.632 --> 01:23:08.331
- I remember
you got really drunk.
- Okay.

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:09.809
Lisa and I kept trying
to give your ass shots

01:23:09.809 --> 01:23:11.464
but all you wanted to do
was fucking play Spades.

01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:12.943
The pot was up
to $1,000 that night

01:23:12.943 --> 01:23:14.902
and everybody was acting
fucking crazy.

01:23:14.902 --> 01:23:17.469
Yeah, motherfuckers
were fucking tripping.

01:23:17.469 --> 01:23:20.778
You know, I was just so excited

01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:23.215
to be around people
that looked like me.

01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:24.825
And I'll be the first to admit,

01:23:24.825 --> 01:23:28.481
I was never the best dancer, Dewayne,

01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:30.440
or the funniest, Shanika,

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.225
or the best cheater,
Nnamdi... Relax.

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.401
Or whatever you do, Lisa.

01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:37.925
- I'm an attorney.
- Congrats.

01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:42.800
But you know,
one thing I love
more than all that is games.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.324
Monopoly, chess,
checkers, Connect Four,

01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:48.501
whatever you wanna play me in,
I'm a monster at it, you know.

01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:50.982
But the one game
I could never,

01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:54.420
ever really get a handle on
was Spades.

01:23:55.769 --> 01:24:00.077
Because nobody plays
Spades in Vermont!

01:24:01.297 --> 01:24:04.648
So, that night I made
one honest mistake.

01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:09.261
I thought I was out of clubs.

01:24:09.261 --> 01:24:11.742
Oh, shit. Shit.
I remember that.

01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:12.960
You fucked around
and you reneged.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.397
And it could have happened
to anybody.

01:24:14.397 --> 01:24:15.789
Not to niggas
who know how to play.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:17.661
It was an honest mistake!

01:24:21.795 --> 01:24:23.145
- What you doing?
- Yes!

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.628
Motherfucker.

01:24:28.628 --> 01:24:30.978
Clifton! I thought he was dead.

01:24:30.978 --> 01:24:32.675
I guess he's better at games
than we thought.

01:24:32.675 --> 01:24:33.981
It was a simple mistake.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:38.508
A mistake that
you all couldn't let go.

01:24:38.508 --> 01:24:43.773
You turned it
into some ultimatum
about how Black I was.

01:24:43.773 --> 01:24:47.343
And you laughed at me,
and you attacked me

01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:48.648
about my Blackness.

01:24:50.433 --> 01:24:51.912
And then you ruined my life.

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:54.263
Everyone gets shit
over Spades,

01:24:54.263 --> 01:24:56.264
it's not like
someone revoked your Black card.

01:24:56.264 --> 01:24:59.529
No, Lisa, you're incorrect.
That's exactly what you said.

01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:01.574
Your exact words. I remember.

01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:04.708
You said, "Yeah, nigga,
your Black card's revoked."
That's what you said.

01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:07.362
You know, that tracks.

01:25:07.362 --> 01:25:11.106
You know, I was really honored
to be your friend, you know.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:13.543
Until you said what you said.

01:25:14.718 --> 01:25:17.503
And then I became
embarrassed, rejected.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:19.288
And you know what I did?

01:25:21.202 --> 01:25:24.858
I drank for the first time
ever that night,

01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:27.992
and I drove away
to escape the ridicule.

01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:32.039
And I didn't see this woman
in front of me

01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:37.741
until her body hit my car.

01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:40.787
If he controlling the locks,
who was controlling them
when he was with us?

01:25:45.052 --> 01:25:47.620
I served 4 years in jail.

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.187
4 years for manslaughter?

01:25:49.187 --> 01:25:51.755
That's like, grad school, man.

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:56.107
You know,
I got a little jealous

01:25:57.369 --> 01:25:58.762
of seeing the lives
you were living,

01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:00.371
the amazing lives
you were living,

01:26:00.371 --> 01:26:02.635
because my life got taken away.

01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:05.769
Because I wasn't
Black enough for you.

01:26:05.769 --> 01:26:09.555
I honestly thought that
those redneck twins

01:26:09.555 --> 01:26:13.994
would have gotten the job done,
but they didn't.

01:26:13.994 --> 01:26:16.867
I guess cheap labor
is cheap for a reason.

01:26:16.867 --> 01:26:18.869
Anyway, I'm gonna
kill you guys now,

01:26:18.869 --> 01:26:20.784
and I'm gonna dispose
your bodies the same way

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:24.396
I did Morgan and Shawn's,
in the well.

01:26:26.137 --> 01:26:27.617
- Nigga!
- Nigga!

01:26:27.617 --> 01:26:28.791
Nigga indeed.

01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:34.666
- Got it.
- Yeah.

01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:36.669
Oh, fuck.

01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:38.584
Okay.

01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:44.329
- I don't know which one...
I don't know which one.
- Try that one.

01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:47.114
How about once and for all
we find out

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:50.248
which one of you
is the Blackest?

01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:54.425
I'm gonna call this round,
Black Sophie's Choice.

01:26:54.425 --> 01:26:57.386
And remember,
you brought this on yourselves.

01:26:57.386 --> 01:27:01.216
You know, for a moment,
I actually thought

01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:06.090
maybe you changed, maybe,

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.485
until you sent me out to die.

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:14.532
And why?
Because I wasn't Black enough?

01:27:14.532 --> 01:27:16.143
It was mainly
just the Trump thing.

01:27:16.143 --> 01:27:17.275
Shut up!

01:27:17.275 --> 01:27:21.800
Lisa, pick! Who is the Blackest?

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.370
And remember, the one you choose
is gonna die.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.111
We're not playing your game,
you just gonna kill us anyway.

01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:29.156
- So, just do it.
Fuck your game, bruh.

01:27:29.156 --> 01:27:30.593
I actually think
we should keep playing.

01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.029
You know what,
I'm with Shanika
and Nnamdi.

01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:33.291
At this point,
you've been fucking
with us

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:35.162
- this entire night.
- That's right.

01:27:35.162 --> 01:27:38.688
So, your non-Black, coon,
MAGA ass can kiss

01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:40.124
my Black ass.
As a matter of fact...

01:27:40.124 --> 01:27:42.257
Do you trust me?
With my life.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.215
Okay,
then play the game.

01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:45.869
...your little
ass crossbow.

01:27:45.869 --> 01:27:47.784
I should flick your little ass
across this goddamn basement.

01:27:47.784 --> 01:27:49.394
Okay,
I'll play your game.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:51.048
Wait, what? Baby, what?

01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:52.309
Lis, how the fuck you just gon'
change your mind like that?

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.529
I'll play your game.

01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:58.228
Yes!
Finally, we have a competitor.

01:27:58.228 --> 01:28:00.362
Now, go ahead, choose.

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:02.102
Which one's the Blackest?

01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:04.452
- I choose myself.
- Wait, baby, what?

01:28:04.452 --> 01:28:07.325
What? No, that's not what I...
What I said.

01:28:07.325 --> 01:28:09.762
I said choose one of them,
one of them.

01:28:09.762 --> 01:28:12.330
Choose one of them!
Go! Now!

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:14.680
Those are the fucking rules,
Lisa! Pick!

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.682
Psst. Nnamdi.

01:28:16.682 --> 01:28:18.902
You talking to me?
Yes.

01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:20.599
Yo, this is trippy.
I didn't think

01:28:20.599 --> 01:28:22.079
this mind talking worked
for the guys,
but go ahead.

01:28:22.079 --> 01:28:24.342
I need you
to hit him low.

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:25.996
Wait a minute.
What?

01:28:25.996 --> 01:28:29.173
I said hit him low
and I'm gonna hit him high.

01:28:29.173 --> 01:28:31.654
Choose one of them!
Choose one of 'em!

01:28:31.654 --> 01:28:33.656
Choose one of 'em, Lisa!

01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:36.267
He's crazy.
Are you sure?
Yes, nigga. I'm sure.

01:28:36.267 --> 01:28:37.660
You heard me,
I choose myself.

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:39.314
Okay.
- I refuse to play
your game.

01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:45.102
Wait,
did you hear all of that?

01:28:45.102 --> 01:28:46.799
Yes,
motherfucker, I did.

01:28:46.799 --> 01:28:48.192
Oh...

01:28:48.192 --> 01:28:50.063
You done
fucked up now!

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:57.680
You guys just gave away
the only thing
you had going for you.

01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.031
And that was
the element of surprise.

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:04.904
It's fine, Dewayne.
It's okay.

01:29:04.904 --> 01:29:09.169
Because luckily,
I still have mine.

01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:13.173
No, no, no!

01:29:13.173 --> 01:29:14.958
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:16.699
No, no, let him bleed.

01:29:16.699 --> 01:29:19.963
Let him go!
Let him go!

01:29:19.963 --> 01:29:22.661
- Let him bleed. Okay?
- Fuck you.

01:29:22.661 --> 01:29:28.450
Lisa, I don't think
you've fully grasped the gravity
of this situation.

01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:32.454
So, I'm going to repeat myself
one last time.

01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:36.719
Which one of your friends
is the Blackest?

01:29:40.592 --> 01:29:43.029
I, I...

01:29:43.856 --> 01:29:44.901
You can try two at a time.

01:29:46.816 --> 01:29:48.165
What was that?
Hey.

01:29:48.165 --> 01:29:50.776
I got... Stay right there.
Stay right there!

01:29:50.776 --> 01:29:53.866
Oh! No! Oh, my...

01:29:54.737 --> 01:29:56.608
Okay. Time out.

01:29:56.608 --> 01:29:59.959
- What the fuck?
- Watch my ear! Let go!

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.134
Shoot him!

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.267
- Shoot who?
- Him!

01:30:03.267 --> 01:30:05.182
- Shoot him!
- Who's him?

01:30:05.182 --> 01:30:07.053
- Shoot him, Shanika!
- Nigga, it's dark!

01:30:07.053 --> 01:30:08.751
- The one on the left.
- The one on the right!

01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:10.013
Wait, who's on the right
and who's on the left?

01:30:10.013 --> 01:30:11.536
- To the left!
Your right.

01:30:11.536 --> 01:30:13.103
My right?
Your left!

01:30:13.103 --> 01:30:14.757
Dewayne,
I don't wanna shoot you.
Say something gay.

01:30:14.757 --> 01:30:16.846
Bitch, that is offensive.
How fucking dare you?

01:30:16.846 --> 01:30:17.934
Got it!

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:21.503
You're gay?

01:30:21.503 --> 01:30:23.112
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What, what?

01:30:23.112 --> 01:30:24.419
I don't know.
I can't see anything.

01:30:32.644 --> 01:30:34.646
Yes, motherfucker!
Yes.

01:30:50.096 --> 01:30:51.837
- Okay, come on,
- we fucking did it.
- Let's get it!

01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:55.406
- Fuck,
wait a minute! Damn!
- Fuck.

01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:04.327
Ain't that some poetic
fucking justice.

01:31:05.198 --> 01:31:07.984
I guess he's not doing too well.

01:31:07.984 --> 01:31:09.550
- Dewayne.
- You see what I did there?

01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:10.639
Somebody's dead, nigga.

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:13.555
- That's a good kick, bruh.
- Thanks.

01:31:13.555 --> 01:31:14.556
Told you we'd handle it.

01:31:16.253 --> 01:31:18.473
- There is an arrow, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:31:37.448 --> 01:31:40.277
We did it. We survived.

01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:43.019
- So, what do we do now?
- Call the cops?

01:31:49.939 --> 01:31:50.896
Oh, shit!

01:31:53.986 --> 01:31:55.031
Hey, but for real, though.

01:32:13.397 --> 01:32:15.312
We can always call
and act like White women.

01:32:15.312 --> 01:32:17.401
Mmm.

01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:19.403
When they get here
expecting Hannah, Kailey
and Kimberley

01:32:19.403 --> 01:32:22.449
and see our Black asses
and it's bang, bang, then what?

01:32:22.885 --> 01:32:24.321
You right.

01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:26.758
Any other ideas
on how to get help

01:32:26.758 --> 01:32:28.891
without getting shot
in the process?

01:32:28.891 --> 01:32:31.894
I got it. I'm a genius.

01:32:41.730 --> 01:32:45.210
So, why did we decide
to do this?

01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:48.388
Oh, because firemen won't
shoot you. You see?

01:32:48.388 --> 01:32:49.912
It's called beating the system.

01:32:49.912 --> 01:32:51.522
I know I'm high as fuck,

01:32:51.522 --> 01:32:53.089
but, nigga, did you change
your clothes?

01:32:53.089 --> 01:32:55.612
Yes, I did! The news might come.
We might be on TV.

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:56.875
- As a highlighter?

01:32:56.875 --> 01:32:58.442
Oh, shit.

01:32:58.442 --> 01:33:00.879
Dewayne,
you was right. Here they
come now.
