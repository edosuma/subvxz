WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:04.579
Matt kissed me.

00:04.613 --> 00:06.591
Did you... kiss him back?

00:06.615 --> 00:08.092
You're smothering me
because you want me

00:08.116 --> 00:09.918
to be dependent on
you or something.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.555
If you can't let me love you the
way that I need to love you,

00:12.579 --> 00:14.505
then I don't know how
to make this work.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.766
Her name is Corey.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.101
She's just a friend.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.769
I need to talk to someone, okay?

00:18.793 --> 00:20.803
And I can't talk to you.
You won't let me.

00:20.879 --> 00:22.847
I... have a boyfriend.

00:22.964 --> 00:24.150
Why didn't you tell me?

00:24.174 --> 00:25.391
Do you still love me?

00:25.425 --> 00:26.726
Of course, I do.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.353
I'm shutting the place down.

00:28.470 --> 00:29.979
It's not my fault, okay?

00:30.055 --> 00:31.532
Kathleen is buying
the restaurant

00:31.556 --> 00:33.233
to get back at Charlie.
It's gone.

00:33.308 --> 00:35.328
I'm sorry, but how the hell
is that not your fault?

00:35.352 --> 00:38.581
You think that, um... you'll ever
be able to forgive me for this?

00:38.605 --> 00:39.999
I don't think I can.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.792
I'm just trying to remember
a time when everything

00:41.816 --> 00:44.754
wasn't falling apart, and
that was when I was with you.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.921
I want you back.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.330
You're too late.

00:47.656 --> 00:48.924
His name is Michael.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.541
We're getting married next week.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.227
Speak of me as I am.

01:51.636 --> 01:56.607
One that loved not
wisely but too well.

01:57.475 --> 02:00.653
I kissed thee, ere
I killed thee.

02:01.563 --> 02:04.699
No way but this, killing myself!

02:06.860 --> 02:08.328
To die upon a kiss.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.879
Uh, that's kind of, like, it.

02:18.455 --> 02:19.724
Great.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.341
Good job. Thank you, guys.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.689
Okay, so, uh, Jake and
Rachel, you're gonna give us

02:26.713 --> 02:28.431
a little <i>Glass Menagerie</i>
tomorrow, right?

02:30.216 --> 02:31.684
See you tomorrow.

02:32.093 --> 02:34.103
Oh, Julia? Justin?

02:34.304 --> 02:35.281
You guys still haven't told me

02:35.305 --> 02:36.856
what scene you're
gonna be working on.

02:36.973 --> 02:39.609
- Uh... I don't...
- We still haven't decided.

02:39.851 --> 02:40.953
I need your answer by tomorrow.

02:40.977 --> 02:42.403
You're scheduled
to go on Friday.

02:46.649 --> 02:47.909
Julia...

02:49.194 --> 02:50.296
We should probably
pick something.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.548
Uh, yeah, I know.
I just keep, uh,

02:52.572 --> 02:54.300
not getting around to
thinking about it, you know?

02:54.324 --> 02:55.342
Okay, well, maybe we could...

02:55.366 --> 02:57.085
I... I can't after school.

02:57.660 --> 02:58.763
Well, neither can I. I...

02:58.787 --> 03:00.630
- I have the dentist...
- I have a teeth cleaning...

03:04.876 --> 03:08.805
All right, uh, look, why
don't you pick something?

03:09.464 --> 03:12.058
Anything's fine with me as long
as I don't have to wear tights.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.611
Okay.

03:13.635 --> 03:17.313
Sure. Then maybe we can grab some
time to rehearse during school.

03:17.597 --> 03:18.940
When we're not so busy.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.150
Yeah.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.498
Claud, you should look around.

03:25.522 --> 03:26.624
If there's anything
you wanna keep,

03:26.648 --> 03:28.908
a menu or something, say so now.

03:30.068 --> 03:31.452
I don't care.

03:31.903 --> 03:33.162
Okay.

03:33.196 --> 03:36.092
Sweetie, you wanna
take some pictures?

03:36.116 --> 03:37.635
'Cause after tomorrow night,

03:37.659 --> 03:39.919
this place is gonna look
a whole lot different.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.421
Great.

03:41.663 --> 03:43.390
Obviously, uh, dining area,

03:43.414 --> 03:46.843
but I need you to do the
kitchen as well, so...

03:47.502 --> 03:48.479
Charlie.

03:48.503 --> 03:49.772
Kathleen, what are
you doing here?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.524
Uh, my, my draftsmen.

03:51.548 --> 03:54.434
I need some quick
blueprints of the space.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.154
Yeah, well, now isn't a very
good time, so maybe you could...

03:57.178 --> 03:58.771
Yeah, I... I can't.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.283
See, I... I've got my
designer flying up from LA

04:01.307 --> 04:02.942
to meet me in two days.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.611
You know what? I think you
should do this some other time.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.655
Okay? This is still
our restaurant.

04:10.608 --> 04:12.160
This is how we're
gonna work things?

04:15.738 --> 04:17.591
I cancel the designer
now, it costs me money.

04:17.615 --> 04:19.885
And I don't want to start
feeling like a chump

04:19.909 --> 04:22.003
for not calling in unpaid loans.

04:25.707 --> 04:28.926
Claudia, um, we'll do
this another time, okay?

04:29.836 --> 04:31.471
I'll see you guys at home.

04:38.803 --> 04:41.907
Don't, uh, bother including
the dimensions of the bar.

04:41.931 --> 04:43.232
That'll be gone.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.256
Hey. Sarah around?

04:57.280 --> 04:58.549
Uh, no.

04:58.573 --> 04:59.884
I got this one, guys.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.250
She's not?

05:01.451 --> 05:02.636
'Cause, we kinda had plans.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.212
We were supposed
to hook up at 4.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.390
Well, she just ran
down to McDougall's

05:06.414 --> 05:07.433
to grab me an E string.

05:07.457 --> 05:09.133
She'll be back in,
like, 20 minutes.

05:10.585 --> 05:12.512
You got her running
your errands for you?

05:13.504 --> 05:15.348
She offered, okay?

05:15.673 --> 05:17.391
You gonna be steamed
at her about that too?

05:19.928 --> 05:21.854
What's that supposed
to mean, "too"?

05:22.764 --> 05:24.200
Nothing. I just know
you've been kinda

05:24.224 --> 05:25.691
ragging on her
lately, that's all.

05:27.185 --> 05:29.622
Yeah, well, why don't
you do me a favor

05:29.646 --> 05:30.664
and mind your own business?

05:30.688 --> 05:32.666
- Okay?
- Hey, all right?

05:32.690 --> 05:34.617
I, for one, hope you
guys work this out.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.536
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.372
No. I mean it.

05:40.323 --> 05:41.675
Sarah's told me all
the lousy stuff

05:41.699 --> 05:43.260
you've been through in
the last two years,

05:43.284 --> 05:46.796
which kind of explains why
you're the way you are.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.010
And I feel sorry for you too...
really.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.057
You want me to tell her
you were looking for her?

06:00.677 --> 06:01.894
Don't bother.

06:07.058 --> 06:09.360
This is a good cup of coffee.

06:10.144 --> 06:11.612
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:12.230 --> 06:14.541
And you know, I'm
really enjoying it,

06:14.565 --> 06:17.952
while you two are just reliving
exactly what you did last night.

06:19.028 --> 06:20.246
What's with you?

06:20.363 --> 06:23.175
She's having a bad day.
Family problems.

06:23.199 --> 06:25.126
So, uh, what do you
wanna do next?

06:25.576 --> 06:27.096
Wanna just hang out here?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.505
Or maybe we could
go see a movie.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.425
I don't know. Whatever you want.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.968
Whatever <i>you</i> want.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.554
- No, whatever <i>you</i> want.
- No, whatever <i>you</i> want.

06:36.671 --> 06:37.930
Let's go see a movie.

06:38.423 --> 06:39.608
I don't know.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.225
I kinda want to hang out here.

06:42.051 --> 06:43.853
- It's kinda cool.
- Yeah?

06:44.053 --> 06:46.407
My brother Bailey had a
girlfriend who worked here.

06:46.431 --> 06:47.658
Does she still work here?

06:47.682 --> 06:49.984
'Cause, uh, maybe we could
get some free stuff.

06:50.852 --> 06:52.028
No.

06:52.353 --> 06:54.322
- She died.
- Oh.

06:55.231 --> 06:57.199
- She's fun.
- Really?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.377
What?

06:58.401 --> 06:59.618
Hey, forget it.

07:01.863 --> 07:03.215
You taste like cinnamon.

07:03.239 --> 07:05.416
So? You taste like chocolate.

07:18.212 --> 07:19.805
Did you get milk for Owen?

07:19.881 --> 07:21.057
Nope.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.142
We're completely out.

07:23.468 --> 07:25.561
So? Big deal. I'll go back out.

07:26.387 --> 07:28.073
Hey, don't get pissed off at me.
It's your turn.

07:28.097 --> 07:30.826
Hey... You know what? Save it.
Okay, Charlie?

07:30.850 --> 07:32.943
I don't need a lesson in how
to take care of things,

07:32.977 --> 07:34.038
especially from you.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.414
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

07:35.438 --> 07:37.333
That's... That's
supposed to mean,

07:37.357 --> 07:39.033
nice going at the
restaurant today.

07:39.650 --> 07:43.454
- Bailey... - No. You really stood
up for yourself, for all of us.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.208
You know what, nothing good was gonna
come out of making some kind of scene.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.543
How about a little self-respect?

07:49.869 --> 07:51.847
Huh? How about maybe
showing Claudia

07:51.871 --> 07:53.891
that you didn't just, didn't
just give the place away?

07:53.915 --> 07:56.060
What am I supposed to do? Tell
me what you want me to do!

07:56.084 --> 07:58.594
No, you know what, Charlie?
This is your problem!

07:59.003 --> 08:00.731
Okay? And I am sick and tired

08:00.755 --> 08:02.316
of taking care of
everything for everyone

08:02.340 --> 08:04.401
and worrying about everyone
all the time, okay?

08:04.425 --> 08:06.195
Had it! I've had it!

08:06.219 --> 08:07.404
Wh... what's this about?

08:07.428 --> 08:09.647
This is about something besides
the restaurant, right?

08:09.806 --> 08:10.981
No.

08:11.808 --> 08:13.693
No. This is about you...

08:14.060 --> 08:15.287
Charlie, okay? And
I don't get it,

08:15.311 --> 08:16.997
because if I were you,
I would be spending

08:17.021 --> 08:18.874
every single second
of every single day

08:18.898 --> 08:20.324
trying to figure out
how to fix this.

08:27.323 --> 08:31.335
Do you ever wish you could
jump ahead to, like, age 40

08:31.452 --> 08:34.839
and look back at a certain
time in your life and go,

08:34.956 --> 08:38.174
"Oh. So that's how
things worked out"?

08:39.585 --> 08:40.970
What'd you like to know?

08:41.629 --> 08:43.357
I'd like to know what
play Justin and I

08:43.381 --> 08:44.733
are gonna end up doing.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.600
At the moment, that
would help a lot.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.687
Would you like to know
what's gonna happen with us?

08:52.557 --> 08:53.816
I don't know.

08:54.809 --> 08:56.026
No.

08:56.394 --> 08:57.737
Why not?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.742
'Cause it's scary.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.172
Oh, it's not so scary that
you don't keep saying yes

09:07.196 --> 09:08.914
whenever I ask you out.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.836
Why do you think you do that?

09:14.871 --> 09:15.931
I don't know.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.173
Um...

09:19.417 --> 09:20.843
It's like that...

09:21.294 --> 09:22.396
time when you kissed me.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.846
I mean...

09:24.297 --> 09:26.650
don't take this the
wrong way or anything,

09:26.674 --> 09:31.196
but I don't know if it was
nice because it was different

09:31.220 --> 09:32.948
because you're a
different person

09:32.972 --> 09:34.450
from the person I'm
used to kissing,

09:34.474 --> 09:39.487
or if it was... nice
because it was you.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.003
Does that...

09:56.954 --> 09:58.798
clear anything up for you?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.092
I don't know. Uh...

10:03.878 --> 10:05.638
Could you maybe do it again?

10:11.636 --> 10:13.479
Matt says you stopped
by the club.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.032
I missed you by,
like, five minutes.

10:15.056 --> 10:16.357
You couldn't have waited?

10:17.642 --> 10:19.151
I didn't feel like
hanging around there.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.621
Oh, so that's why you said,

10:20.645 --> 10:22.822
"Don't bother telling
Sarah I stopped by"?

10:24.273 --> 10:25.449
Boy, Matt...

10:25.858 --> 10:28.452
Matt's real good at remembering
conversations, isn't he?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.830
What I told him,
what you told him.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.790
What is it, Bailey?

10:33.032 --> 10:34.375
You mean, this time?

10:34.784 --> 10:35.886
Right?

10:35.910 --> 10:37.471
What is Bailey's
problem this time?

10:37.495 --> 10:40.256
Because, because he's always
got a problem with something.

10:40.414 --> 10:41.808
- I didn't mean...
- Well, it's true,

10:41.832 --> 10:43.050
isn't it?

10:43.459 --> 10:46.772
And you know what? I am sick and
tired of apologizing for it

10:46.796 --> 10:47.898
all the time!

10:47.922 --> 10:49.858
'Cause I don't wanna be
this person that you,

10:49.882 --> 10:51.568
that you have to put up with!

10:51.592 --> 10:52.977
You're not, Bailey.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.854
Look, are you, are you happy?

10:56.013 --> 10:58.075
Are you, Sarah? Do... Do I
make you happy anymore?

10:58.099 --> 11:00.025
Because I-I really
don't think I do.

11:00.643 --> 11:02.695
Of course you do. Sure, you do.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.005
I don't, I don't make
you happy anymore,

11:12.029 --> 11:13.497
is that what you're
really saying?

11:13.948 --> 11:14.883
Is it?

11:14.907 --> 11:17.793
Not a whole hell of a lot
makes me happy these days.

11:19.036 --> 11:20.254
Including me.

11:21.706 --> 11:23.048
Say it. Just...

11:23.165 --> 11:24.383
say it, please.

11:26.877 --> 11:28.095
Okay.

11:28.337 --> 11:29.680
Including you.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.447
So, what do we do about that?

11:37.471 --> 11:38.939
How do we fix that?

11:41.434 --> 11:42.776
We don't.

11:55.406 --> 11:57.249
Sarah, when... When...

11:57.491 --> 12:00.002
When things are bad
almost all the time,

12:00.661 --> 12:01.596
and,

12:01.620 --> 12:03.473
and you have to change so much

12:03.497 --> 12:06.550
to make the other person okay, that
you're not even yourself anymore,

12:07.293 --> 12:08.761
then...

12:10.379 --> 12:12.222
Then that's when
people break up.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.310
So...

12:17.803 --> 12:19.271
you wanna break up?

12:24.393 --> 12:25.778
It's not working.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.406
It's not. Us.

12:30.524 --> 12:32.336
And, and when things
aren't good anymore,

12:32.360 --> 12:35.913
then that's when it
should be over, so...

12:37.948 --> 12:39.249
So, yeah.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.294
Yes, I do.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.102
I gotta hand it to you, Charlie.

12:58.135 --> 12:59.687
You're good at intrigue.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.730
Hey, Jake.

13:02.723 --> 13:04.451
Can't meet at the house,

13:04.475 --> 13:07.120
too complicated to discuss
on the telephone.

13:07.144 --> 13:08.529
You got me wondering.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.624
How you been?

13:10.648 --> 13:12.199
Oh, I can't complain.

13:14.110 --> 13:17.047
At least I haven't got a
going-out-of-business sign

13:17.071 --> 13:19.832
stuck to the side
of my restaurant.

13:21.617 --> 13:25.180
I'm guessing that isn't just
an advertising ploy, huh?

13:25.204 --> 13:26.390
No.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.674
No, it's, um...
It's kind of bad.

13:29.667 --> 13:30.727
I mean, it's...

13:30.751 --> 13:32.386
It's really bad.

13:32.670 --> 13:36.014
And, uh, I can't figure out
any way out of it on my own.

13:36.674 --> 13:38.559
Hm? So you called me.

13:39.468 --> 13:43.156
But... I'd have figured
I'd be the last person...

13:43.180 --> 13:44.732
Well, you're a
businessman, right?

13:45.641 --> 13:47.943
And maybe there's some
way to fix this, some...

13:47.977 --> 13:49.611
Some angle that I haven't seen.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.707
You're thinking
that I called you

13:52.731 --> 13:54.116
just because I need
something, right?

13:55.192 --> 13:57.077
Are you gonna tell me different?

14:00.573 --> 14:01.915
I'm sorry.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.292
I...

14:03.451 --> 14:05.085
I don't know what else to do.

14:05.953 --> 14:07.588
Tonight's the last night.

14:07.705 --> 14:09.882
Joe's closing the
place, so this is it.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.519
And if I don't come up
with something fast,

14:12.543 --> 14:13.812
I mean, before that
sale goes through,

14:13.836 --> 14:16.430
then it's... It's gonna be gone.

14:18.507 --> 14:19.725
Just gone.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.107
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.995
So did you read it
over last night?

14:30.019 --> 14:31.320
No.

14:32.313 --> 14:33.739
Hey, you were busy too.

14:34.899 --> 14:37.701
Okay. Fine. Well,
um, let's just...

14:37.860 --> 14:39.745
start with where they
say goodbye, okay?

14:42.490 --> 14:43.749
What?

14:45.242 --> 14:46.627
What is that?

14:47.203 --> 14:48.712
- What?
- That...

14:49.455 --> 14:51.475
thing under your collar,
under the turtleneck,

14:51.499 --> 14:53.643
which you are wearing even
though it's 78 degrees outside.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.095
- Julia, wait a sec... - 'Cause
it looks like a hickey to me.

14:56.587 --> 14:58.972
Tell me, I'm wrong, Justin.
Tell me, it's not a hickey.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.611
Just a friend, huh?

15:02.635 --> 15:04.279
Someone to talk to, 'cause
you can't talk to me?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.396
All right, all right, fine, yes.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.232
We fooled around a
little bit last night.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.442
It just kinda happened, and...

15:11.143 --> 15:13.612
Julia, it's been a
long time, and I...

15:14.480 --> 15:16.124
Look, I don't know
what it meant, okay?

15:16.148 --> 15:17.709
Yeah, right! It
didn't mean anything.

15:17.733 --> 15:20.035
It just happened because
she's fun, right?

15:20.069 --> 15:22.047
And willing, unlike some people.

15:22.071 --> 15:24.090
She probably doesn't have
any stupid moods either,

15:24.114 --> 15:25.467
unlike some people!

15:25.491 --> 15:26.843
And you don't have to
be careful of her.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.128
Who needs that, right? Is
that what you were thinking?

15:29.495 --> 15:31.255
Julia. Julia...

15:57.439 --> 15:58.907
Hey, Claud.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.367
Oh.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.786
Ross, I, um, I didn't hear you.

16:05.072 --> 16:06.456
What are you doing?

16:06.740 --> 16:08.426
I just heard about the
restaurant closing.

16:08.450 --> 16:09.710
I thought you might...

16:11.787 --> 16:13.338
Just wondering if you were okay.

16:13.539 --> 16:14.715
Yeah.

16:15.457 --> 16:16.601
I'm okay.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.927
It's been a long time since I
heard you play that piece.

16:19.461 --> 16:21.972
In fact, it's been a long
time since I heard you play.

16:23.340 --> 16:24.442
I wasn't playing.

16:24.466 --> 16:27.144
I was just, uh, trying
it out for a second.

16:30.556 --> 16:34.193
I just wanted to see how much
I remembered, that's all.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.488
That's all.

16:42.651 --> 16:44.754
Wow. A lot of people, huh?

16:44.778 --> 16:46.798
Yep. We're booked
until midnight.

16:46.822 --> 16:48.248
All the regulars.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.051
We had a couple of
guys fighting over

16:50.075 --> 16:51.960
who gets to keep the last menus.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.087
That's nice, I guess.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.464
Yeah.

16:55.706 --> 16:57.132
Dad'd like that.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.385
So, the regular table?

17:01.211 --> 17:02.888
I'm not that hungry.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.097
Me, neither.

17:05.340 --> 17:08.393
I think... I think I'm
not gonna stay, Joe.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.103
Yeah, what's the point?

17:13.641 --> 17:15.358
Joe, can I ask you a favor?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.329
Uh, can you manage without me?

17:17.353 --> 17:18.829
'Cause I don't think any
of us wanna be around

17:18.854 --> 17:20.415
when you turn off the lights.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.615
Sure.

17:23.901 --> 17:25.753
Guys? I'll call you tomorrow?

17:25.778 --> 17:27.746
We're still on for
Friday dinner, right?

17:42.586 --> 17:44.147
You gotta be kidding me, man.

17:44.171 --> 17:45.472
Nope.

17:46.256 --> 17:47.474
It's the best thing.

17:48.008 --> 17:49.518
How can it be the best thing?

17:49.718 --> 17:51.144
'Cause it's what I want.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.480
'Cause the whole thing just...

17:53.973 --> 17:55.274
It wasn't fun anymore.

17:56.433 --> 17:58.068
It wasn't fun anymore?

17:58.519 --> 18:00.413
Yeah. What's your problem, Will?

18:00.437 --> 18:02.666
My problem is that
she loves you, Bay.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.951
Right, right. She loves me
because she feels sorry for me.

18:06.735 --> 18:07.671
What?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.756
Yeah, and I'm
following her around

18:09.780 --> 18:11.299
like some kind of pathetic jerk.

18:11.323 --> 18:12.717
But, you know what?

18:12.741 --> 18:14.084
You know what? I don't need it.

18:14.785 --> 18:17.170
That's what I finally figured out, Will.
I don't need it.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.349
It's like I've been spending
my whole life worrying

18:19.373 --> 18:20.684
about everybody else around me.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.093
You know, is... Is Sarah...

18:23.377 --> 18:24.636
Is she safe?

18:24.795 --> 18:27.023
Is she happy? Is she gonna
be okay when I'm gone?

18:27.047 --> 18:29.391
You know what? That's...
That's not my problem!

18:29.675 --> 18:31.194
It's the same thing
with the restaurant!

18:31.218 --> 18:32.195
Not my problem.

18:32.219 --> 18:33.989
Charlie, not my problem.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.690
Okay, okay. S... so things
are tough right now, but...

18:37.474 --> 18:39.192
This is Sarah, Bay.

18:39.768 --> 18:40.986
It's over.

18:41.353 --> 18:42.779
And you know what? That's fine.

18:42.896 --> 18:43.832
That's fine, 'cause I'm...

18:43.856 --> 18:45.532
I'm outta here in
September, anyway.

18:45.983 --> 18:47.951
I'm gonna leave all
this crap behind.

18:48.444 --> 18:49.828
I'm done.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.461
Are you meeting her?

19:00.539 --> 19:01.715
No.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.845
You just here to
make me feel worse?

19:07.004 --> 19:08.221
No.

19:13.677 --> 19:14.654
Julia, I'm...

19:14.678 --> 19:16.897
You don't have to explain,

19:17.139 --> 19:20.525
'cause, I kind of think,
I know what happened.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.111
'Cause it happened to me too.

19:24.396 --> 19:25.530
What?

19:26.774 --> 19:28.492
I met someone too...

19:29.735 --> 19:31.671
at that photography class,

19:31.695 --> 19:35.957
and... I've been kind of
spending time with him.

19:36.450 --> 19:37.667
Ian.

19:40.370 --> 19:41.630
Oh.

19:43.499 --> 19:44.883
So, anyway...

19:46.376 --> 19:47.719
do you love her?

19:48.462 --> 19:49.638
No.

19:52.132 --> 19:53.850
I don't think so, no.

19:56.386 --> 19:57.562
Do you love him?

19:58.722 --> 19:59.898
No.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.735
So, what's going on with us?

20:06.355 --> 20:08.824
I... can't...

20:09.566 --> 20:11.952
make it go back to
the way it was.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.131
I don't know why.

20:15.155 --> 20:16.498
Why can't I?

20:18.492 --> 20:20.460
I want to, I do,

20:20.536 --> 20:23.004
'cause it used to be...

20:23.956 --> 20:26.842
whenever I looked
at you or just...

20:27.251 --> 20:29.010
hearing you say my name...

20:33.257 --> 20:35.934
But I can't get past
all this stuff.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.146
I can't.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.233
Well, neither can I.

20:51.608 --> 20:52.993
Is this...

20:54.153 --> 20:56.163
So, uh... this is it?

20:59.658 --> 21:03.003
Yeah, I think so.

21:15.716 --> 21:16.892
K...

21:18.051 --> 21:19.519
I wanna know.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.021
I just...

21:21.638 --> 21:23.825
Just, just tell me, what,

21:23.849 --> 21:25.275
What were you thinking?

21:25.684 --> 21:28.487
What was going through
your mind when, two days,

21:28.687 --> 21:30.582
two days before my
wedding, Charlie,

21:30.606 --> 21:32.375
before my wedding
to another man,

21:32.399 --> 21:34.409
you go and send me
six dozen roses?

21:35.319 --> 21:36.254
Seven. Seven dozen.

21:36.278 --> 21:39.215
It was, it was kind of a buy
six, get one free kinda thing.

21:39.239 --> 21:40.999
Six, seven, whatever. It's sick.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.635
What are you trying to do?

21:42.659 --> 21:44.053
Are you trying to...
ruin everything?

21:44.077 --> 21:45.471
No, look, I... I...

21:45.495 --> 21:47.182
I just think you're
making a huge mistake

21:47.206 --> 21:48.558
by marrying this guy.

21:48.582 --> 21:49.841
<i>You</i> think?!

21:51.168 --> 21:52.854
Since when do you
even get a vote?

21:52.878 --> 21:54.471
I mean, this is so...

21:57.341 --> 22:00.143
What about me, huh?
What about what I want?

22:00.552 --> 22:01.895
You want Michael.

22:02.262 --> 22:03.647
You're in love with Michael.

22:04.806 --> 22:07.317
Why is that so hard to believe?

22:07.768 --> 22:09.078
You... you've never
even met him.

22:09.102 --> 22:11.446
How do you know he isn't
the perfect man for me?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.240
Well, let's see, uh,

22:13.815 --> 22:15.585
a nice guy in his 30s,

22:15.609 --> 22:17.202
who just happens
to have a child.

22:17.611 --> 22:18.546
You know what? He sounds like

22:18.570 --> 22:20.131
the perfect man
for you, Kirsten.

22:20.155 --> 22:22.383
But you better be in love with
more than his qualifications.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.834
And I think you're moving way
too fast to know for sure.

22:27.329 --> 22:29.923
Why don't we just stop
acting like this is about me

22:30.248 --> 22:32.384
and just admit that this
is really about you?

22:33.210 --> 22:34.646
You only want me back, Charlie,

22:34.670 --> 22:35.813
because you know
you can't have me,

22:35.837 --> 22:37.264
and you're afraid of losing me.

22:37.714 --> 22:38.974
Yes, I am.

22:40.008 --> 22:41.351
Because I love you.

22:42.469 --> 22:43.738
And I think-...

22:43.762 --> 22:47.983
I think... if you love me,
then we can be happy together.

22:49.351 --> 22:50.652
So, do you?

22:51.395 --> 22:52.570
Love me?

22:55.023 --> 22:56.376
I'm getting married, Charlie.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.742
That's not an answer.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.499
Do you love me?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.167
Yes.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.378
And you wanna be with me?

23:08.537 --> 23:09.754
Yes.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.307
And you're ready
for all the things

23:11.331 --> 23:13.174
that you weren't ready
for six months ago?

23:15.335 --> 23:16.553
I am.

23:17.087 --> 23:19.097
And you think I'm
kidding myself?

23:21.258 --> 23:23.226
Ask yourself this, Charlie...

23:24.594 --> 23:26.354
Would you be doing any of this,

23:27.097 --> 23:29.774
feeling this way,
wanting me so much,

23:29.975 --> 23:31.828
if you weren't watching
everything else in your life

23:31.852 --> 23:33.236
go down the drain?

23:48.368 --> 23:49.627
Hey!

23:50.328 --> 23:52.505
Oh, hi.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.257
Hi.

23:54.624 --> 23:55.842
Test?

23:55.917 --> 23:57.177
Uh, yeah.

23:57.461 --> 23:59.512
Miss Wilkerson. I'm screwed.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.806
Well, remember Gary B.

24:02.758 --> 24:04.986
- What?
- G-A-R-Y-B.

24:05.010 --> 24:08.355
Greece, Albania, Romania,
Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.

24:08.555 --> 24:10.074
- The Balkans.
- Yeah.

24:10.098 --> 24:11.534
Remember, when I was
helping you study and...

24:11.558 --> 24:13.360
- Yeah.
- we came up with that.

24:14.311 --> 24:15.747
Oh, I've got study
hall next period

24:15.771 --> 24:17.238
if you need quizzing
or something.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.532
That's okay.

24:19.691 --> 24:22.702
Bailey, can we talk, please?

24:23.403 --> 24:25.538
- Maybe if we tried...
- Sarah, don't.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.209
- Don't what?
- Come on, you know.

24:30.619 --> 24:32.003
Don't make it harder.

24:55.185 --> 24:57.237
So you planning on
going to class?

24:58.063 --> 24:59.989
Yeah, eventually.

25:01.983 --> 25:04.285
I saw you and Sarah in
the hall this morning.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.788
Oh, yeah?

25:06.863 --> 25:08.132
I was kind of confused,

25:08.156 --> 25:11.302
but Will kinda filled me
in on what was going on...

25:11.326 --> 25:13.920
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay, Julia?

25:16.456 --> 25:17.642
It's hard to explain,

25:17.666 --> 25:19.717
a... and you wouldn't
get it, anyway, so...

25:26.716 --> 25:28.309
Justin and I broke up.

25:31.012 --> 25:32.397
What?

25:32.722 --> 25:35.859
And this is the weird thing.

25:36.059 --> 25:37.902
I really love Justin.

25:38.311 --> 25:41.281
But it turns out
that's not enough.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.419
Yeah, exactly.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.328
- You're right.
- No...

25:47.737 --> 25:49.423
Don't agree with me, Bailey.

25:49.447 --> 25:52.792
It's... it's... different
with you and Sarah.

25:53.368 --> 25:55.012
And Justin and I had reasons.

25:55.036 --> 25:56.463
Something happened.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.768
And it's so hard to find
the exact right person,

26:00.792 --> 26:02.010
you know.

26:02.961 --> 26:07.098
So, the idea of looking for
reasons to split up...

26:08.508 --> 26:10.194
You just can't be
that stupid, Bailey.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.696
You can't look for problems

26:11.720 --> 26:13.605
- when there are already
so many as it is.

26:22.898 --> 26:25.617
That was pretty lame, walking out
on us like that the other day.

26:26.109 --> 26:28.495
Yeah, I'm surprised
you even noticed.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.622
This isn't my fault.

26:30.989 --> 26:34.876
I tried to find a guy for you,
and I tried to include you.

26:35.368 --> 26:37.212
Yeah. Don't do me any favors.

26:37.579 --> 26:38.796
Fine.

26:38.872 --> 26:41.559
Make your own plans. Get
your own boyfriend.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.384
I can't, okay?

26:43.960 --> 26:45.021
Why not?

26:45.045 --> 26:46.429
Because.

26:47.672 --> 26:50.099
Because I... I don't wanna
do stuff like that yet.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.195
I mean, making out and stuff,

26:52.219 --> 26:54.771
and all these things you have
to do when you get a boyfriend.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.817
Anyway, it's not like guys are
gonna be interested in me.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.486
Obviously.

27:01.811 --> 27:03.738
Guys like girls
with boobs and...

27:04.231 --> 27:05.657
everything.

27:05.941 --> 27:07.909
Like this is my problem?

27:08.860 --> 27:10.286
I'm having fun.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.455
I'm not gonna stop just
'cause you're not ready.

27:13.490 --> 27:16.677
And you have no right walking
around pissed off all the time

27:16.701 --> 27:18.670
like what I'm doing
is so terrible.

27:18.912 --> 27:21.089
Like you wouldn't do the
same thing if you could.

27:21.456 --> 27:22.632
I know.

27:24.584 --> 27:26.511
I know. I just, um...

27:29.381 --> 27:30.640
kinda miss you.

27:32.008 --> 27:33.268
And...

27:33.677 --> 27:36.563
you don't miss me because you
have something else going on.

27:39.599 --> 27:41.067
So, now what do we do?

27:43.061 --> 27:44.445
I don't know.

27:46.940 --> 27:48.408
See you around, I guess.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.203
Guess so.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.423
The town gave us
a lunch today...

28:04.749 --> 28:06.134
with champagne.

28:07.711 --> 28:09.304
The mayor gave a speech.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.433
I ate and listened,

28:13.842 --> 28:15.810
but my heart was here with you.

28:17.387 --> 28:20.315
I've, uh... I've...

28:21.308 --> 28:22.618
Become accustomed.

28:22.642 --> 28:26.487
I've... become
accustomed to you.

28:28.898 --> 28:30.825
Will we ever see
each other again?

28:32.819 --> 28:34.412
I don't think so.

28:37.991 --> 28:40.209
Tomorrow, it'll all be a memory.

28:41.411 --> 28:45.381
And I suppose, we'll
start a new life.

28:48.918 --> 28:51.804
Nothing ever happens
the way we want it.

28:55.425 --> 28:57.769
What can I say to
wish you farewell?

29:04.267 --> 29:05.902
Life is hard.

29:08.563 --> 29:11.866
To many, it is blank
and hopeless.

29:15.445 --> 29:21.000
But still, it is slowly
becoming easier and brighter.

29:22.535 --> 29:25.755
And the time is not far off...

29:28.500 --> 29:34.013
The time is probably not far off
when it will be quite cloudless.

29:41.805 --> 29:43.106
Hi.

29:44.057 --> 29:44.950
Jake!

29:44.974 --> 29:46.911
I still have a key,
but I didn't know

29:46.935 --> 29:48.736
how you'd feel
about my using it.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.655
What are you doing here?

29:50.730 --> 29:51.707
Well, at the moment,

29:51.731 --> 29:53.626
I'm trying to get
my breath back,

29:53.650 --> 29:55.169
after climbing those steps.

29:55.193 --> 29:58.454
I was wondering if I might have
a cold glass of something?

29:58.822 --> 30:00.540
Uh, yeah.

30:02.283 --> 30:04.261
I was talking to your
brother this afternoon

30:04.285 --> 30:05.461
about the restaurant.

30:07.163 --> 30:08.057
You were?

30:08.081 --> 30:10.851
I guess he felt that with
all my business experience,

30:10.875 --> 30:12.385
I could be of some help to you.

30:13.962 --> 30:15.898
Yeah, well, he... he
shouldn't have done that.

30:15.922 --> 30:17.223
He shouldn't have come to you.

30:17.465 --> 30:19.892
That is his fault. His mess.

30:20.176 --> 30:22.478
And it's too late. There's
nothing anybody can do about it.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.408
Anyway, if you're
here to see him,

30:25.432 --> 30:27.567
I don't think he's here.
I didn't see his truck.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.445
Well, actually, I
came to see you.

30:33.356 --> 30:34.866
I have a proposal.

30:53.793 --> 30:54.854
You shouldn't be here, Charlie.

30:54.878 --> 30:56.105
They're about to
start the toasts.

30:56.129 --> 30:57.388
I know.

30:57.630 --> 30:59.015
It's just, um,

30:59.591 --> 31:03.320
what you said yesterday, about...
about me wanting us to work out

31:03.344 --> 31:05.229
only 'cause at the
moment nothing else is?

31:05.346 --> 31:07.023
Well, you were wrong, Kirsten.

31:07.140 --> 31:08.483
Charlie, I've gotta...

31:11.227 --> 31:13.164
How do you know that?

31:13.188 --> 31:14.906
Because I love you,

31:15.106 --> 31:17.533
and I know that in a way
that I haven't known before.

31:17.901 --> 31:19.837
And... and yeah, maybe
it took me needing you

31:19.861 --> 31:21.213
a-at a really bad
point in my life

31:21.237 --> 31:23.048
t-to realize just how
much I love you, but...

31:23.072 --> 31:24.290
What's going on?

31:24.616 --> 31:25.750
Who's this?

31:27.160 --> 31:28.095
- Is this...
- It's... it's okay.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.555
What's he doing here? Kirsten...

31:29.579 --> 31:30.556
It's okay, Michael.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.006
Go back inside.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.050
You got a lot of nerve, pal.

31:34.334 --> 31:35.468
Flowers?

31:35.877 --> 31:37.178
Coming here?

31:37.295 --> 31:38.397
- I ought to punch...
- Mich...

31:38.421 --> 31:40.973
Michael, stop it, please.
Just...

31:41.049 --> 31:42.067
Just go back inside.

31:42.091 --> 31:43.434
I can handle this.

31:43.927 --> 31:45.311
I'm asking you.

31:46.221 --> 31:48.439
Please.

31:54.687 --> 31:56.030
I'm taller than he is.

31:58.107 --> 31:59.408
Uh...

31:59.859 --> 32:02.087
Where was I? I kinda lost my...
my flow.

32:02.111 --> 32:03.621
How I was wrong about you?

32:03.863 --> 32:05.382
Right, right.

32:05.406 --> 32:08.209
Um, Kirsten, the thing is,

32:09.035 --> 32:11.254
there's-there's no way for
me to prove that to you.

32:11.746 --> 32:14.016
I mean, I could wait until
things are straightened out

32:14.040 --> 32:16.060
with the restaurant and
come back to you and say,

32:16.084 --> 32:19.011
"See, everything's going great, and...
and I still love you."

32:19.170 --> 32:21.931
But... but who knows how
long that's gonna take?

32:22.257 --> 32:25.309
And... and things may never
work out with Salingers.

32:26.177 --> 32:29.021
And I know that you
need guarantees,

32:29.973 --> 32:32.817
'cause of what
happened last time.

32:33.226 --> 32:37.613
But the truth is I...
I can't give you any.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.659
I... I don't know how to
make you certain about me.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.662
So...

32:44.779 --> 32:45.965
Ch... Charlie...

32:45.989 --> 32:47.790
So here's what I came to say.

32:50.034 --> 32:51.294
Yes?

32:52.453 --> 32:53.671
Marry him.

32:56.082 --> 32:57.383
What?

32:57.625 --> 32:58.968
Marry Michael.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.470
If you... if you know
that he loves you

33:01.588 --> 33:03.681
and you definitely know
that you love him,

33:03.798 --> 33:05.308
then do it, Kirsten.

33:05.675 --> 33:07.310
'Cause I can't ask you to...

33:07.844 --> 33:09.979
It... it's not fair for
me to ask you to...

33:10.388 --> 33:11.856
to take a chance on me.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.027
I really, really want
you to be happy.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.741
You son of a bitch!

33:34.871 --> 33:36.088
Where've you been?

33:37.206 --> 33:38.341
Out.

33:38.541 --> 33:39.842
And I'm going to bed.

33:40.209 --> 33:41.594
Want you to see something.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.190
You got into college?

33:55.308 --> 33:56.776
Hampshire State?

33:56.893 --> 33:59.288
Yeah, I got in.

33:59.312 --> 34:03.199
It's... it's big, huh,
for someone like me?

34:03.232 --> 34:05.576
A... a... and a real school,
not just like a little...

34:05.902 --> 34:07.630
Not a little
community-college thing.

34:07.654 --> 34:08.589
Bailey, that...

34:08.612 --> 34:09.882
It's even better than that.

34:09.906 --> 34:12.958
'Cause, how are we gonna
afford to send me to college?

34:13.368 --> 34:16.837
So, I actually got someone
to pay for it too.

34:17.538 --> 34:19.590
Jake was gonna pay for it.

34:19.916 --> 34:22.635
He was putting away money so
that I could go to school.

34:22.918 --> 34:26.023
Man, that's... why didn't
you say something sooner?

34:26.047 --> 34:27.514
We gotta celebrate, Bay.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.016
Right.

34:31.803 --> 34:34.188
Only here's the thing, Charlie.

34:35.056 --> 34:36.649
Jake came to see me today,

34:37.266 --> 34:38.869
and he told me that
you went to him

34:38.893 --> 34:40.527
to ask him for help
with the restaurant.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.623
He came to see you?
Why would he...

34:42.647 --> 34:44.500
He said that he could
take care of things,

34:44.524 --> 34:48.128
that he could... he could pay
off the owners of the building,

34:48.152 --> 34:50.579
kind of a bribe not to sell it.

34:51.155 --> 34:52.831
He could save the place,

34:53.616 --> 34:56.835
or he could send me to school.

34:58.871 --> 35:01.465
One or the other, but
he can't do both.

35:01.624 --> 35:03.634
And he left it up to me.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.391
He left it up to me.

35:12.510 --> 35:15.155
Bailey, I... I had no idea.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.408
He said he was gonna look
into some possibilities,

35:17.432 --> 35:18.617
and he hadn't
gotten back to me...

35:18.641 --> 35:22.278
You know what... you know what, Charlie?
Sometimes I hate you so much.

35:25.189 --> 35:26.532
This was it.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.293
This was finally it.

35:28.317 --> 35:30.494
I was just gonna take
care of myself for once.

35:30.903 --> 35:32.214
For once.

35:32.238 --> 35:35.541
And I was gonna get outta
here, and I was so close.

35:37.285 --> 35:38.627
So, go.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.088
- Just go.
- Yeah.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.267
Yeah, I'll explain that
to Julia and Claudia.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.184
No.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.801
No, look, no one's gonna know.

35:46.836 --> 35:49.148
Okay? This is just between
you and me and Jake,

35:49.172 --> 35:52.016
and it never
happened, all right?

35:52.592 --> 35:55.269
The restaurant is history, and
you're going away to school.

35:56.971 --> 36:01.577
And... and I'm sorry,
'cause you're right.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.778
You deserve to get away,
and you should go.

36:04.145 --> 36:06.906
I want you to go. I'm
telling you to go, Bay.

36:15.865 --> 36:17.124
Julia?

36:19.494 --> 36:22.004
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

36:23.331 --> 36:24.850
I know I shouldn't
do this anymore.

36:24.874 --> 36:26.226
- I shouldn't be here...
- No.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.094
No, it's okay.

36:29.629 --> 36:31.639
Wh... Did... did
something happen?

36:33.758 --> 36:35.393
I don't know how to do this.

36:36.719 --> 36:38.020
How to do what?

36:38.930 --> 36:41.690
I don't remember
how to be alone.

36:42.016 --> 36:45.704
Mm. How did I do it before?

36:45.728 --> 36:48.364
How did I get through the day?

36:48.940 --> 36:52.159
And it's like
"Justin and Julia."

36:52.819 --> 36:54.338
"Justin and Julia."

36:54.362 --> 36:57.091
It... it's this one word that
I have heard for so long.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.292
And when it's just my name,

37:00.326 --> 37:02.378
it... it feels like
something is missing.

37:06.249 --> 37:08.551
I don't know how to
be apart from you.

37:10.044 --> 37:12.471
I don't think I... I can.

37:17.301 --> 37:18.769
Look, Julia, I...

37:20.555 --> 37:24.400
I think that it's
supposed to get easier.

37:26.102 --> 37:27.403
When?

37:28.146 --> 37:31.282
How do you know? I mean, maybe it...
it won't.

37:31.357 --> 37:32.459
Maybe this is a mistake.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.368
Maybe we shouldn't break up.

37:34.485 --> 37:35.744
No.

37:37.113 --> 37:40.425
I don't think that we
should stay together

37:40.449 --> 37:43.169
just because it's too
hard for us to be apart.

37:45.913 --> 37:47.798
I don't think that's
a good reason.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.930
I keep thinking...

37:57.049 --> 38:01.604
that one day, you're gonna fall
in love with someone else,

38:02.054 --> 38:06.609
some other girl,
someone who isn't me.

38:11.606 --> 38:13.073
I hope so.

38:13.566 --> 38:15.034
God, I hope so.

38:18.196 --> 38:21.165
But, you'll always be

38:21.199 --> 38:24.627
the first one I
ever loved, Julia.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.262
So, is everything okay?

38:35.963 --> 38:38.224
Nothing's okay, actually.

38:39.175 --> 38:40.485
I mean, the restaurant's closed,

38:40.509 --> 38:43.729
and I kinda just
lost my best friend.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.650
Not really, but... pretty much.

38:48.851 --> 38:50.152
That sounds bad.

38:50.353 --> 38:51.570
Yeah, and I...

38:52.772 --> 38:55.783
I heard Charlie and Bailey
talking last night, and...

38:57.235 --> 39:01.747
I think Bailey's going away to school...
far away, and...

39:01.948 --> 39:02.966
I can't say anything,

39:02.990 --> 39:05.167
'cause I don't want them
to know that I know.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.754
And I don't want him not
to go just because of me.

39:09.914 --> 39:13.801
But... I don't want him to go.

39:17.129 --> 39:18.889
I don't want him to go away.

39:23.135 --> 39:24.520
So, you're playing again?

39:26.722 --> 39:27.940
Yeah.

39:29.308 --> 39:30.994
Only I don't want
everyone to see

39:31.018 --> 39:34.248
because... then they'll
get, like, all excited,

39:34.272 --> 39:36.365
and then there'll be, like,
all this pressure, and...

39:37.191 --> 39:38.909
I don't want pressure.

39:40.903 --> 39:43.289
All I wanna do is
play the violin.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.457
That's all.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.167
I mean...

39:47.994 --> 39:49.795
I think I wanna start again.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.966
And I think I need to.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.262
Well, I get that.

39:58.796 --> 40:00.014
I do.

40:01.966 --> 40:03.350
So, let's start again.

40:04.051 --> 40:05.153
That sounded pretty before.

40:05.177 --> 40:06.645
Let's see how much you remember.

40:07.763 --> 40:09.023
Come on.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.309
And step together,
step together.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.310
That's it.

40:36.334 --> 40:39.511
And step together,
step together.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.064
Very good.

40:41.088 --> 40:42.848
Remember to smile.

40:43.507 --> 40:44.725
Oh.

40:45.384 --> 40:46.862
You all right, sweetheart?

40:46.886 --> 40:48.196
Why? Why do you ask?

40:48.220 --> 40:49.448
Well, to be honest?

40:49.472 --> 40:51.231
You look a little on
the green side. Heh.

40:51.932 --> 40:54.911
Uh, I need... I need... just...

40:54.935 --> 40:56.612
Could you just...

40:57.438 --> 40:59.490
There's air outside, right?

41:34.517 --> 41:36.235
What, Bailey? What do you want?

41:38.521 --> 41:41.365
You left this note for
me in my locker, and...

41:41.690 --> 41:43.992
- And before I opened it,
I wanted to... -Wow.

41:45.361 --> 41:47.538
Wow, you're not even gonna
give me a chance, are you?

41:48.656 --> 41:50.175
You don't treat people
you love like that.

41:50.199 --> 41:51.542
You just don't.

41:51.992 --> 41:54.128
- Sarah...
- Yeah, so we have problems.

41:54.662 --> 41:56.890
I push you away too much,
you're too protective,

41:56.914 --> 41:58.350
I spend too much
time with the band.

41:58.374 --> 41:59.726
You don't-you don't
like me changing.

41:59.750 --> 42:00.968
So what?

42:01.919 --> 42:04.388
So you sit down, so you
talk about things.

42:05.423 --> 42:06.682
Uh, I just...

42:07.591 --> 42:09.476
I hate you feeling sorry for me.

42:10.970 --> 42:11.947
What?

42:11.971 --> 42:13.949
That's what you told Matt,
that you stay with me

42:13.973 --> 42:15.524
is because you
feel sorry for me.

42:15.558 --> 42:17.109
I never said that.

42:18.144 --> 42:19.830
I said that I felt bad
about all the things

42:19.854 --> 42:21.071
you've been through.

42:21.605 --> 42:23.490
God, feel sorry for you?

42:23.732 --> 42:26.410
Bailey, I'm... I'm,
like, completely,

42:26.444 --> 42:27.953
completely in love with you.

42:30.197 --> 42:31.749
And, I thought that was enough.

42:33.409 --> 42:34.511
But, I guess it's not.

42:34.535 --> 42:36.138
I guess you want me to go away,

42:36.162 --> 42:37.671
and you want me to disappear,

42:38.247 --> 42:39.840
so, you can make a fresh start

42:40.124 --> 42:43.135
someplace else
with someone else.

42:45.546 --> 42:46.930
I'm not.

42:48.048 --> 42:49.192
I'm not going.

42:49.216 --> 42:51.560
I'm not going away to school.

42:52.970 --> 42:54.271
It's a done deal.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.690
I'm using my college money
to save the restaurant.

42:57.057 --> 42:58.160
It's complicated.

42:58.184 --> 43:00.068
Jake worked out all the details.

43:00.728 --> 43:01.945
I don't get it.

43:02.855 --> 43:05.250
I thought getting outta here was
the most important thing to you.

43:05.274 --> 43:06.575
Yeah, so did I.

43:09.069 --> 43:10.287
But...

43:11.655 --> 43:12.790
the problem is...

43:14.366 --> 43:18.138
is that I've spent
two years fighting,

43:18.162 --> 43:20.464
really fighting,

43:21.290 --> 43:22.591
to keep us all together.

43:23.751 --> 43:26.178
And so, the idea...

43:26.921 --> 43:29.306
the idea that I'd be the
first one to leave...

43:31.926 --> 43:34.937
I mean, us being a family
no matter what was...

43:36.055 --> 43:37.648
was kind of the whole point.

43:39.808 --> 43:41.151
And you,

43:41.852 --> 43:43.153
you're the whole point.

43:43.896 --> 43:44.789
Bailey...

43:44.813 --> 43:45.707
And...

43:45.731 --> 43:47.741
And... and I don't know
what happened to me.

43:48.484 --> 43:50.244
Sarah, I don't, but...

43:51.695 --> 43:53.664
it was like for a second
there, it just...

43:54.740 --> 43:56.384
It all just seemed
like too much,

43:56.408 --> 43:58.252
you know, and I, and I
couldn't handle it.

43:58.953 --> 44:01.129
But, the thing is...

44:02.331 --> 44:04.299
The thing is, I
have to handle it.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.052
I have to, because...

44:07.836 --> 44:10.681
because being with you and...

44:11.507 --> 44:14.518
and taking... taking
care of all of them...

44:17.012 --> 44:19.231
that's kind of who I am.

44:34.446 --> 44:36.007
You'd think since
it's the last night,

44:36.031 --> 44:38.333
people would make a
point of being on time.

44:38.576 --> 44:39.918
Is Joe around?

44:40.369 --> 44:43.380
Yeah, he's in the kitchen
making manicotti.

44:43.956 --> 44:45.183
You know, I was finally
gonna tell him,

44:45.207 --> 44:47.894
"Joe, I love you, but, man,
your manicotti blows,"

44:47.918 --> 44:50.387
but... he got this
phone call, so, uh...

44:51.755 --> 44:53.432
manicotti.

44:53.882 --> 44:55.819
- Man, what a way to end it.
- Mm.

44:55.843 --> 44:57.779
Hey. Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

44:57.803 --> 44:59.104
I lost track of time.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.865
Sarah and I got to talking and...

45:00.889 --> 45:02.316
Smooching, probably.

45:02.850 --> 45:04.119
What else is new?

45:04.143 --> 45:05.652
Bay?

45:06.353 --> 45:07.821
So, you two...

45:09.815 --> 45:12.200
Good. That's good, Bay.

45:12.359 --> 45:13.493
Yeah.

45:13.694 --> 45:15.547
Anyway, listen, there's something
I gotta tell you guys.

45:15.571 --> 45:17.549
Guys, listen to this. You're
not gonna believe it.

45:17.573 --> 45:18.717
This is unbelievable.

45:18.741 --> 45:21.928
I just got off the phone
with Montgomery, and...

45:21.952 --> 45:22.971
get a load of this...

45:22.995 --> 45:24.379
He's not gonna
sell the building.

45:24.788 --> 45:26.224
Yeah, exactly. How'd
you know that?

45:26.248 --> 45:27.350
Uh, I heard.

45:27.374 --> 45:29.561
I heard that he wanted to hold
onto it for a while longer,

45:29.585 --> 45:30.802
so he took it off the market.

45:31.128 --> 45:32.638
- Really?
- Yup.

45:32.963 --> 45:34.264
Really, Bay?

45:35.007 --> 45:36.609
Hey, Charlie, did you hear?

45:36.633 --> 45:38.852
Wait a second. He changed
his mind just like that?

45:39.678 --> 45:42.064
Yeah, just like that.

45:42.306 --> 45:44.066
Hey!

45:45.142 --> 45:47.110
Owen! Owen, we're
not going anywhere.

45:49.897 --> 45:51.156
You sure, man?

45:52.649 --> 45:54.836
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

45:54.860 --> 45:57.829
'Cause I meant what I said. I
mean, it's a lot to give up.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.041
Actually...

46:04.745 --> 46:06.088
not so much.

46:07.998 --> 46:09.174
Right.

46:09.249 --> 46:11.093
You said count to 50.

46:16.590 --> 46:17.766
You didn't tell them?

46:18.425 --> 46:19.810
Uh, not yet.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.738
Here's an idea: Why
don't I just go back

46:21.762 --> 46:22.822
to the truck and wait?

46:22.846 --> 46:23.740
No, Kirsten, wait.

46:23.764 --> 46:25.200
No, Charlie. This
was a bad idea.

46:25.224 --> 46:28.370
This... this is a bad time. This is
your last dinner. You guys should...

46:28.394 --> 46:31.247
We're celebrating, actually. The
owner's decided not to sell.

46:31.271 --> 46:32.614
We're staying put.

46:35.484 --> 46:36.910
You... you two didn't just...

46:37.820 --> 46:39.005
Did you two just...

46:39.029 --> 46:40.580
What did you two just do?

46:40.739 --> 46:42.467
-We... we did not get married.

46:42.491 --> 46:44.209
Well, I didn't get married.

46:44.368 --> 46:46.670
I mean, I didn't, and we didn't.

46:47.037 --> 46:48.306
But... but mainly, I didn't.

46:48.330 --> 46:50.350
Um, heh. I was about to,

46:50.374 --> 46:53.853
but I... kinda changed my mind.

46:53.877 --> 46:55.220
The thing with me is...

46:55.462 --> 46:57.222
always a bride, never a bride.

47:00.050 --> 47:01.518
So, what does this mean?

47:02.886 --> 47:04.062
- Beats me.
- Beats us.

47:05.180 --> 47:06.565
But probably...

47:07.099 --> 47:08.400
something good.

47:08.851 --> 47:10.485
Probably something pretty great.

47:15.023 --> 47:16.418
- Hi, you.
- Hey.

47:16.442 --> 47:17.576
Oh.

47:18.819 --> 47:21.496
So, what are the chances of getting
something to eat around here?

47:22.114 --> 47:23.466
- Manicotti in five.
- Woo!

47:23.490 --> 47:24.592
The table needs setting.

47:24.616 --> 47:26.334
Make yourselves useful.

47:26.994 --> 47:27.929
All right.

47:27.953 --> 47:29.212
Hey.

47:30.747 --> 47:32.475
You hate manicotti?

47:32.499 --> 47:33.884
Here you go.
