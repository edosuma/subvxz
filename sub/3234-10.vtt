02:31.381 --> 02:33.615
Surprised he doesn't make
us do that.

02:36.786 --> 02:39.386
The pack totally
has a pecking order.

02:39.421 --> 02:43.423
And the head Hyena,
he's the man.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.859
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

02:45.893 --> 02:48.394
I mean, literally.
It's so gross.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.864
They have to lick his jerk.

02:51.898 --> 02:55.201
I-I-I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

02:58.402 --> 03:01.301
Yo, if this is supposed
to be all, like,

03:01.336 --> 03:03.469
Major League and all,

03:03.504 --> 03:07.005
we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

03:10.674 --> 03:14.375
And water boys.
You know?

03:14.409 --> 03:17.643
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

03:19.612 --> 03:22.080
Get us a couple flunkies
in here.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.614
Treat us right.

03:33.822 --> 03:37.191
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

03:38.592 --> 03:40.860
I'm going to hit it,
if that's cool with you.

03:40.894 --> 03:42.494
I don't understand.

03:42.528 --> 03:43.828
What?

03:43.863 --> 03:45.730
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

03:45.764 --> 03:48.432
Told you.
Dude's totally boning us.

03:48.466 --> 03:51.300
No, it's not that.

03:51.335 --> 03:52.935
It's our output.
We're off.

03:52.969 --> 03:56.337
We're .14% off.

03:56.371 --> 04:00.673
Point one-four,
that's what, like--

04:00.707 --> 04:02.140
What does that mean?

04:02.175 --> 04:05.976
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

04:08.012 --> 04:11.114
So how far off are we?

04:11.148 --> 04:12.815
It's not negligible.

04:14.718 --> 04:19.220
Ball-parking it, I'd say we're
quarter to a half a pound shy.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.390
That's weird.

04:24.424 --> 04:26.992
What about spillage?

04:27.026 --> 04:28.327
Spillage?

04:28.361 --> 04:30.662
Yeah, you know, like,
just stuff gets spilled.

04:30.696 --> 04:32.731
Nothing gets spilled.

04:32.765 --> 04:34.165
A little maybe.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.933
Nothing gets spilled.

04:35.968 --> 04:39.437
What about evaporation?

04:39.472 --> 04:40.805
It wouldn't account
for this much.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.041
The materials aren't out
that long.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.909
What about the other one?

04:44.943 --> 04:47.912
The drops, like on--

04:47.946 --> 04:50.147
on that, like, cold beer.

04:50.182 --> 04:51.482
Condensation?

04:51.516 --> 04:52.716
Yeah.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.352
No.

04:55.988 --> 04:58.858
What about the crap
that gets left behind,

04:58.893 --> 05:01.958
you know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats?

05:01.992 --> 05:05.460
I add up, like, a gallon each.

05:05.494 --> 05:08.062
Did you work that in?

05:08.096 --> 05:09.963
Vestiges?

05:09.998 --> 05:11.865
Yeah. Vestiges.

05:15.836 --> 05:17.670
Bet that's it.

05:17.704 --> 05:20.105
Bet that's totally it.

05:23.309 --> 05:25.443
Hey, Mr. White.

05:27.179 --> 05:28.545
Mr. White.
Huh?

05:30.715 --> 05:32.949
Are you okay?

05:32.983 --> 05:34.817
Yeah-- Yeah, why?

05:37.687 --> 05:39.388
Nothing.

05:50.364 --> 05:51.765
Are you coming?

05:51.799 --> 05:53.733
Yeah, in a minute.

05:56.403 --> 05:57.970
All right, see you tomorrow.

06:59.827 --> 07:01.227
All right.

07:07.259 --> 07:08.892
Shit.

07:09.992 --> 07:12.125
You bastard.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.201
Son of a--

07:39.581 --> 07:41.581
Come on, you--

07:41.616 --> 07:43.349
Come on, come on.

07:48.054 --> 07:49.620
Son of a--

08:01.030 --> 08:02.830
Okay.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.710
Son of a bitch.

08:21.014 --> 08:22.314
Oh!

08:35.428 --> 08:36.961
That's great.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.346
All right.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.635
You little bastard.

11:11.994 --> 11:13.560
Shut the door!

11:13.594 --> 11:15.161
My ears are popping.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.496
Shut the door.
Move.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.631
It's like
I'm on an airplane, yo.

11:19.665 --> 11:20.665
What the hell's doing that?

11:20.699 --> 11:21.799
Positive pressure.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.235
Positive what?

11:24.269 --> 11:26.903
God, friggin' kills, yo.

11:26.938 --> 11:28.905
Well, just move your jaw around.
Move it around.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.540
I am moving it around.
It's not working.

11:30.575 --> 11:32.942
Then just yawn or something.
Stop acting like such a baby.

11:33.977 --> 11:35.578
Damn.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.080
W-W-What positive?
Positive what?

11:38.114 --> 11:41.048
Pressure. I've turned
the ventilation up

11:41.083 --> 11:43.584
to keep the outside out.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.953
There's been a contamination.

11:46.987 --> 11:49.290
Wait. What?

11:49.324 --> 11:51.458
Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up.

11:51.492 --> 11:53.794
Something got into the lab.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.430
So what do we do?

11:56.465 --> 11:57.765
I mean, do we--

11:57.800 --> 12:01.235
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't
we be wearing masks?

12:01.270 --> 12:04.507
No, no, it's not that--
that kind of contaminant.

12:04.541 --> 12:07.343
So it's, like, not dangerous?

12:07.377 --> 12:11.013
Mr. White,
talk to me here.

12:11.047 --> 12:14.249
Not to us particularly. No.

12:16.085 --> 12:17.385
What the hell is that?

12:17.419 --> 12:21.389
This is, uh-- I made it.

12:23.691 --> 12:27.726
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

12:33.030 --> 12:34.732
A fly.

12:36.539 --> 12:38.241
What do you mean?

12:38.275 --> 12:41.043
A fly, like--
like what do you mean?

12:41.077 --> 12:44.145
I mean a fly, a house fly.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.483
Like, uh, one fly?

12:49.517 --> 12:53.286
Singular?
What did it do?

12:53.320 --> 12:55.621
It got into the lab,
and I'm trying to get it out.

12:55.656 --> 12:57.323
Okay? Understand?

12:57.357 --> 12:59.691
No, man, not really.

12:59.725 --> 13:03.894
I can't say that I'm
really following you here.

13:03.928 --> 13:06.796
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

13:06.830 --> 13:09.032
I mean, when you say
it's contamination,

13:09.066 --> 13:12.037
I mean, I'm thinking, like
an Ebola leak or something.

13:12.071 --> 13:13.471
Ebola?

13:13.505 --> 13:15.839
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel,

13:15.874 --> 13:16.940
where all your intestines

13:16.975 --> 13:18.909
sort of just slip
right out of your butt.

13:18.943 --> 13:21.377
Thank you. I know wt Ebola is.
Uh-huh.

13:21.412 --> 13:24.080
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

13:24.114 --> 13:25.648
be doing in our lab?

13:25.683 --> 13:27.150
Hmm?

13:27.184 --> 13:30.019
So you're chasing around a fly,

13:30.054 --> 13:34.024
and in your world
I'm the idiot.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.728
Jesse, listen.

13:37.762 --> 13:40.364
This fly-- any fly--

13:40.399 --> 13:41.931
cannot be in our lab.

13:41.966 --> 13:43.398
It's-- It's a problem.

13:43.433 --> 13:44.864
It's a contamination,

13:44.898 --> 13:47.198
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

13:47.232 --> 13:48.332
Okay?

13:48.367 --> 13:51.969
So in terms of keeping
our cook clean

13:52.003 --> 13:54.237
and our product unadulterated,

13:54.272 --> 13:56.806
we need to take this.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.340
Now do you understand?

14:01.843 --> 14:03.577
So is that your fly saber?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.784
This is a swatter.

14:07.818 --> 14:10.053
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

14:10.088 --> 14:14.057
Uh-huh. Hey,
what happened to your head?

14:14.092 --> 14:15.859
Nothing. I'm fine.

14:15.893 --> 14:18.794
You didn't hit it,
like really-- really hard?

14:18.828 --> 14:20.962
My head is not the problem,
Jesse.

14:20.997 --> 14:23.198
The fly is the problem.

14:24.567 --> 14:28.203
You didn't happen to maybe...

14:28.237 --> 14:31.306
try our product, did you?

14:31.340 --> 14:35.840
Jess I know this seems
unusual to you, a layman.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.643
A fly-- I get it--
seems insignificant, right?

14:38.677 --> 14:39.977
But trust me.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.446
In a highly controlled
environment such as this--

14:46.184 --> 14:47.985
...anyollutant--

14:49.988 --> 14:52.655
...no matter how small--

14:55.359 --> 14:57.260
...could completely--

15:11.539 --> 15:12.873
Hello.

15:15.543 --> 15:16.710
What?

15:20.214 --> 15:23.215
Were you here all night?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.984
Have you even slept?

15:25.018 --> 15:28.020
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

15:28.054 --> 15:29.120
Will you just please focus--

15:35.561 --> 15:38.096
Okay, look. We're running late,
so let's just get started.

15:38.131 --> 15:40.632
Shall we? The sooner we do
it, the sooner we're done.

15:40.666 --> 15:43.735
Frickin' finally.

15:46.639 --> 15:48.340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:48.374 --> 15:50.108
What are you doing?

15:50.142 --> 15:52.410
It's time to alkaline.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.379
Have you not heard
a word I said?

15:55.414 --> 15:58.783
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

15:58.817 --> 16:01.519
Have I been speaking to self?

16:01.553 --> 16:03.988
The mer went off, yo.

16:04.022 --> 16:06.824
How long is this batch going to be good for?
An hour? Two?

16:06.859 --> 16:09.126
The batch will be good
for nothing

16:09.161 --> 16:11.295
if we don't clear
the contaminant.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.264
Clear the contaminant?

16:13.298 --> 16:15.098
We're making meth here,

16:15.133 --> 16:16.533
not space shuttles.

16:16.567 --> 16:19.802
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

16:19.837 --> 16:21.070
What fly?

16:21.104 --> 16:24.274
Where the hell is this fly?

16:24.307 --> 16:25.774
Not like I've even seen
the thing.

16:25.808 --> 16:28.576
Maybe your positive pressure blew
it out the door or something.

16:28.611 --> 16:32.147
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

16:32.181 --> 16:34.683
He's around,
and am not going to expose

16:34.718 --> 16:37.987
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

16:38.021 --> 16:41.523
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself, or you can help me,

16:41.558 --> 16:42.690
but you are right.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.158
We are running out of time,

16:44.192 --> 16:45.990
so I need your answer
right now.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.031
Okay.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.875
Hey, tick-tock. Yo.

17:15.882 --> 17:19.518
Look, I like making cherry
products, but let's keep it real.

17:19.551 --> 17:21.786
All right, we make poison

17:21.820 --> 17:24.021
for people who don't care.

17:24.056 --> 17:26.923
We probably have the most
UN-picky customers in the world.

17:26.957 --> 17:29.558
No, no, no, no, no.
No rationalizing.

17:29.592 --> 17:32.060
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

17:44.941 --> 17:46.608
Did you--

17:46.643 --> 17:50.646
Did you know that there's an
acceptable level of rat turds

17:50.680 --> 17:54.549
that can go into candy bars?

17:54.584 --> 17:57.552
That's the government, Jack.

17:57.587 --> 17:59.988
Even the government

18:00.023 --> 18:03.125
doesn't care that much
about quality.

18:04.727 --> 18:10.565
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs? Huh?

18:11.600 --> 18:14.069
Pig lips and assholes,

18:14.103 --> 18:17.505
but I say, hey,
have at it, bastard,

18:17.540 --> 18:21.009
because I love hotdogs,

18:21.043 --> 18:23.712
and, you know,
see what I'm--

18:23.746 --> 18:24.979
What are you doing?

18:25.014 --> 18:26.948
Oh. Hey.

18:29.585 --> 18:31.687
Look, let me just top it off,

18:31.722 --> 18:33.389
all right, really quick.

18:33.424 --> 18:35.725
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid,

18:35.759 --> 18:37.325
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

18:42.697 --> 18:45.599
It stays closed.
That's an order.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.967
You can't order shit,
Adolf.

18:48.002 --> 18:51.672
We're 50-50 partners.
Remember?

18:56.377 --> 18:58.445
Ow!

18:58.480 --> 19:01.182
God, what is your problem,
bro?

19:03.118 --> 19:04.751
Freakin' psycho.

19:06.087 --> 19:07.486
Jesse.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.288
Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.

19:10.322 --> 19:11.655
Jesse.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.424
Jesse.

19:16.727 --> 19:18.228
You see it, right?

19:19.663 --> 19:21.097
You see it?

19:21.131 --> 19:23.399
Yeah.

19:25.535 --> 19:27.103
Get it.

19:29.072 --> 19:31.473
You want me to get it?

19:31.508 --> 19:33.242
Yes.

19:35.312 --> 19:38.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow.

19:38.648 --> 19:40.682
Move slowly.

19:40.716 --> 19:41.883
I know.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.884
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

19:43.919 --> 19:47.087
Absolutely. I'm just going
to need your swatter thing.

19:50.758 --> 19:53.359
Yeah. Come on.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.095
Oh, yeah.
It's okay, come on.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.598
Come on.
Make it count.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.799
Yeah, no, no,
I'm gonna--

20:01.834 --> 20:04.568
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.071
Ok. Now.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.605
On three.

20:08.639 --> 20:10.206
Okay.

20:10.241 --> 20:11.508
One--

20:11.542 --> 20:13.276
Ow!

20:13.310 --> 20:16.377
Yeah. You like that?

20:16.411 --> 20:17.778
Hurts, huh?

20:21.249 --> 20:22.582
Did you get it?

20:22.616 --> 20:25.351
I think so, yeah.
Where is it?

20:25.385 --> 20:27.386
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.387
Who cares?
I got it.

20:29.422 --> 20:31.055
Oh, Jesus, seriously?

20:31.090 --> 20:33.491
Where is it?

20:33.525 --> 20:37.061
It's, uh, right there.
Look.

20:37.095 --> 20:40.498
Look. See?
I told you I got it.

20:50.011 --> 20:51.711
This is a raisin.

20:53.114 --> 20:55.415
Look, I definitely got it, man.

20:55.449 --> 20:57.017
All right--

20:58.519 --> 21:00.954
Oh, man.

21:00.988 --> 21:03.289
He's got some skills, yo.

21:03.324 --> 21:05.358
I'll give him that.

21:05.393 --> 21:09.430
Look...

21:09.464 --> 21:13.835
I feel like I'm running out of
ways to explain this to you,

21:13.869 --> 21:17.472
but once more I shall try.

21:17.507 --> 21:21.477
This fly is a major problem
for us.

21:21.512 --> 21:24.147
It will ruin our batch.

21:24.181 --> 21:26.183
Now, we need to destroy it

21:26.217 --> 21:30.321
and every trace of it
so we can cook.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.189
Failing that...

21:34.793 --> 21:36.660
we're dead.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.734
There is no more room
for error.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.438
Not with these people.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.277
All right,
how about we go get some air?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.214
Get some air?

21:55.249 --> 21:59.118
Your answer to "We're sliding
head-first into a massive crap--"

21:59.153 --> 22:00.820
Mister-- Mr. White,

22:00.855 --> 22:04.158
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.660
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

22:05.694 --> 22:09.030
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

22:09.064 --> 22:10.998
it would help us
come up with a plan

22:11.032 --> 22:12.563
on how to catch it.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.196
Then come back down here

22:14.230 --> 22:16.396
and subtract his ass.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.373
Oh, wait,
do you have your keys?

22:39.408 --> 22:40.942
Yeah.
You're sure?

22:40.976 --> 22:42.877
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

22:42.911 --> 22:45.179
Yeah.

22:45.214 --> 22:46.614
Hey!

22:46.648 --> 22:48.883
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

22:48.917 --> 22:51.252
Hey!

22:56.558 --> 22:59.359
Yo. Yo, does somebody have
an ax I can use?

22:59.393 --> 23:00.893
El ax-o!

23:00.927 --> 23:02.595
<i>Peligroso! El ax-o!</i>

23:33.650 --> 23:35.351
There we go.

23:40.889 --> 23:42.723
Say good night.

23:45.093 --> 23:46.626
Son of a bitch!

23:51.331 --> 23:53.365
Son of a...

23:54.801 --> 23:56.935
Shit! Damn it!

23:59.838 --> 24:01.906
Where in the hell is that...

24:18.456 --> 24:19.756
What the hell?

24:24.962 --> 24:27.696
Need some juice maybe?

24:30.046 --> 24:31.048
<i>Knock yourself out.</i>

24:32.232 --> 24:35.634
It's a real one.
Yeah, like yours was working.

24:35.668 --> 24:37.602
No, no...

24:37.636 --> 24:41.438
No, no-- Look, we're trying
to decontaminate.

24:41.473 --> 24:44.340
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.808
What the hell is all this?

24:48.011 --> 24:51.046
Here, how about this?

24:51.081 --> 24:52.948
"Nontoxic glue strips."

24:52.983 --> 24:55.983
Yeah, baby,
it's got pheromones.

24:56.018 --> 24:58.151
I got a buttload.
We hang them up all over the place.

24:58.186 --> 25:00.019
It won't be able to resist.

25:06.059 --> 25:07.960
I sure hope we have enough.

25:07.994 --> 25:11.663
I'm going to go out
on a limb and say yeah.

25:13.366 --> 25:14.833
Do you see him?

25:17.036 --> 25:19.639
How long do you think
you've been awake?

25:19.673 --> 25:21.674
Why do you keep asking me that?

25:21.708 --> 25:24.510
Just figure you could use
some coffee, is all.

25:24.544 --> 25:26.479
I know I could.

25:26.513 --> 25:28.580
How about it?

25:30.149 --> 25:31.616
Yeah.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.754
You take cream and sugar?

25:35.788 --> 25:36.955
Black is fine.

25:49.868 --> 25:52.637
Why don't you
just leave him be?

25:52.671 --> 25:55.040
Let the traps do the work.

25:55.074 --> 25:58.311
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

26:00.079 --> 26:04.216
I bet we catch this mo-fo
any second.

26:17.396 --> 26:19.930
Thank you.

26:19.965 --> 26:23.800
You ever have, like,
a wild animal

26:23.835 --> 26:25.535
trapped our house?

26:29.641 --> 26:32.509
Not that I can recall, no.

26:32.543 --> 26:35.846
We did, this one time,

26:35.880 --> 26:37.714
back when it was
my aunt's house,

26:37.749 --> 26:42.019
back before she died of cancer.

26:42.053 --> 26:46.822
Possum.
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

26:46.857 --> 26:50.859
Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"?
What's up with that?

26:50.894 --> 26:52.228
I mean, when I was coming up,

26:52.262 --> 26:54.230
it was just "possum."

26:54.264 --> 26:58.103
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

26:58.138 --> 27:01.373
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

27:01.407 --> 27:04.275
Whatever. They're just
big rats anyways,

27:04.309 --> 27:05.776
giant pink-tailed rats

27:05.810 --> 27:08.311
with their pink rat faces,

27:08.346 --> 27:10.180
totally freaky,

27:10.214 --> 27:12.482
like alien rats.

27:15.086 --> 27:18.422
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

27:18.456 --> 27:22.793
but he was living there
under the house.

27:22.827 --> 27:26.163
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

27:26.197 --> 27:29.399
always scurrying around.

27:29.434 --> 27:31.568
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

27:31.602 --> 27:34.838
and he would just,
you know, freeze.

27:34.872 --> 27:38.375
And it's like you're not
looking right at it. Right?

27:38.409 --> 27:41.344
I mean, it thinks
it's fooling you.

27:41.378 --> 27:45.081
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

27:45.115 --> 27:47.417
It's just so lame.

27:47.451 --> 27:52.888
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

27:52.923 --> 27:55.757
a point that
you'll be arriving at

27:55.792 --> 27:59.060
sometime in the near future?

27:59.095 --> 28:02.998
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

28:03.032 --> 28:07.602
A guy came,
set all these traps and all,

28:07.636 --> 28:09.771
and he finally got it,

28:09.805 --> 28:11.639
but my aunt,

28:11.673 --> 28:15.309
she didn't believe it.

28:15.344 --> 28:19.647
She kept insisting she
could still hear the thing.

28:19.681 --> 28:22.850
I mean, you could not
tell her any different.

28:22.884 --> 28:24.852
She started keeping
an old umbrella

28:24.886 --> 28:27.287
by her chair.

28:27.322 --> 28:30.357
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

28:30.391 --> 28:33.093
even gave it a name.

28:33.127 --> 28:35.195
It was, uh, Sc--

28:35.229 --> 28:37.097
Scrabble.

28:37.131 --> 28:38.498
Yeah, that was it.

28:38.533 --> 28:41.334
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

28:44.605 --> 28:47.974
She got like that
toward the end.

28:49.911 --> 28:52.545
Got obsessive about stuff,

28:52.580 --> 28:56.583
just got mad about stuff.

28:56.617 --> 28:59.485
We didn't know what was up.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.089
It wasn't like her
to be that way.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.495
But it turned out
that the--

29:09.530 --> 29:12.899
the cancer had spread
to her brain,

29:12.933 --> 29:15.935
and that was why.

29:15.969 --> 29:18.771
It metastasized.

29:21.175 --> 29:25.745
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor

29:25.779 --> 29:30.783
because then we knew
what was up

29:30.818 --> 29:33.653
and got her some treatment

29:33.687 --> 29:36.289
and meds so she wasn't
stressing all the time.

29:40.894 --> 29:44.830
It was a lot better after that.

29:44.865 --> 29:47.533
She was a lot happier.

29:55.942 --> 29:57.409
Where the hell is he?

30:07.020 --> 30:11.523
I've been to my oncologist,
Jesse, just last week.

30:14.494 --> 30:16.695
I'm still in remission.

30:18.097 --> 30:20.031
I'm healthy.

30:20.066 --> 30:24.102
Okay, so good.
Great.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.475
Well, no end in sight.

30:36.849 --> 30:40.452
Well, I missed it.

30:46.459 --> 30:51.028
There was some perfect moment,

30:51.063 --> 30:53.030
and it passed me right by.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.304
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

31:00.338 --> 31:03.374
That was the whole point.

31:03.409 --> 31:07.612
None of this makes any sense

31:07.647 --> 31:10.115
if I didn't have enough.

31:12.352 --> 31:17.022
But it had to be before
she found out... Skyler.

31:17.056 --> 31:19.324
It had to be before that.

31:19.358 --> 31:22.694
Perfect moment...

31:22.729 --> 31:25.597
For what?

31:25.631 --> 31:27.599
To drop dead?

31:28.601 --> 31:30.369
What, are you saying
you want to die?

31:33.673 --> 31:37.643
I'm saying I've lived too long.

31:41.715 --> 31:44.550
You want them
to actually miss you.

31:44.584 --> 31:46.986
You know?

31:47.020 --> 31:49.422
You want their memories of you

31:49.456 --> 31:51.291
to be--

31:54.229 --> 31:57.565
But she just won't understand.

31:57.599 --> 31:59.567
She just--

31:59.602 --> 32:04.507
No matter how well
I explain it,

32:04.541 --> 32:07.644
these days
she just has this--

32:07.678 --> 32:11.348
this--

32:11.383 --> 32:12.650
I mean, I truly believe

32:12.684 --> 32:15.854
there exists
some combination of words.

32:15.888 --> 32:18.056
There must exist

32:18.091 --> 32:19.224
certain words

32:19.259 --> 32:22.462
in a certain, specific order

32:22.496 --> 32:24.264
that would explain all of this,

32:24.298 --> 32:28.102
but with her I just--

32:28.136 --> 32:31.206
I just can't ever seem
to find them.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.675
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

32:33.709 --> 32:36.679
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

32:36.713 --> 32:38.848
but before the fugue state

32:38.882 --> 32:40.216
they didn't have enough money,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.685
so no, not then.

32:51.595 --> 32:56.566
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.402
It had to be
Afr Holly was born.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.070
Mr. White--

33:01.104 --> 33:03.272
Definitely before the surgery.

33:05.742 --> 33:08.511
Oh, Christ.

33:08.545 --> 33:10.613
That damn second cell one.

33:10.647 --> 33:12.515
How could I possibly...

33:23.393 --> 33:25.461
Ah, I know the moment.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.902
It was the night Jane died.

33:43.948 --> 33:48.948
And we needed diapers,
and so I said I'd go,

33:48.982 --> 33:51.747
but it was just an excuse.

33:51.782 --> 33:53.548
Actually, that was
the night I--

33:53.582 --> 33:56.380
I brought you your money,
remember?

33:56.415 --> 33:59.947
Yeah, I remember.

33:59.981 --> 34:04.280
But afterward I stopped
at a bar.

34:04.315 --> 34:09.279
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

34:09.313 --> 34:12.047
I just walked in, sat down.

34:17.351 --> 34:19.753
I never told you.

34:19.788 --> 34:21.688
That you went to a bar?

34:27.094 --> 34:32.097
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

34:32.130 --> 34:34.931
he engages me in conversation.

34:34.967 --> 34:36.601
Now, he's a complete stranger.

34:38.503 --> 34:42.873
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

34:42.907 --> 34:46.043
Donald Margolis.

34:46.078 --> 34:47.678
What are you talking about?

34:47.713 --> 34:50.514
Of course I didn't know it
at the time.

34:50.549 --> 34:53.650
I mean, it was just some guy
in a bar.

34:53.685 --> 34:56.621
Didn't put it together
until after the crash

34:56.655 --> 34:57.889
when he was all over the news.

34:57.923 --> 35:00.559
Jane's dad.

35:00.593 --> 35:03.929
I mean, think of the odds.

35:03.964 --> 35:05.531
Once I tried to calculate them,

35:05.565 --> 35:07.800
but they're astronomical.

35:07.835 --> 35:10.403
I mean, think of the odds

35:10.437 --> 35:12.336
of me going in, sitting down

35:12.371 --> 35:14.733
that night in that bar

35:14.768 --> 35:16.268
next to that man.

35:19.637 --> 35:21.371
What did you talk about?

35:24.374 --> 35:28.843
Oh, water on Mars.

35:32.180 --> 35:33.947
Family.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.117
What about family?

35:41.554 --> 35:43.654
I told him
that I had a daughter,

35:43.689 --> 35:47.557
and he told me he had one, too.

35:47.558 --> 35:51.960
Then he said,
"Never give up on family."

35:54.930 --> 35:56.630
And I didn't.

35:58.333 --> 36:00.967
I-- I took his advice.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.841
The universe is random.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.775
It's not inevitable.

36:19.810 --> 36:22.811
It's simple chaos.

36:22.845 --> 36:27.881
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.317
That's what science teaches us,

36:30.351 --> 36:33.052
but what is this saying?

36:35.055 --> 36:36.622
What is it telling us,

36:36.656 --> 36:37.889
when on the very night

36:37.924 --> 36:42.527
that this man's daughter dies,

36:42.561 --> 36:46.231
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

36:49.869 --> 36:51.769
How can that be random?

36:51.803 --> 36:53.704
Hey, listen, Mr. White.
Hey--

36:53.739 --> 36:55.707
Hey, sit down.

36:55.741 --> 36:57.175
No-- No.

36:57.210 --> 37:00.780
No, it's--

37:01.916 --> 37:03.851
Oh.

37:03.885 --> 37:05.652
Oh.

37:09.024 --> 37:12.660
No, that--
that was the moment.

37:14.964 --> 37:16.464
That night.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.938
I should never have left home.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.278
Never gone to your house.

37:32.249 --> 37:35.518
Maybe things would have--

37:40.591 --> 37:42.993
Oh, thought I was--

37:45.832 --> 37:49.037
I was at home watching TV.

37:50.842 --> 37:53.580
Some--

37:53.614 --> 37:57.622
Some nature program
about elephants.

38:00.262 --> 38:02.867
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

38:06.241 --> 38:08.578
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

38:12.618 --> 38:14.585
She was singing a lullaby.

38:20.425 --> 38:22.159
Ah--

38:23.562 --> 38:29.233
If had just lived
right up to that moment

38:29.267 --> 38:31.268
and not one second more--

38:44.582 --> 38:47.083
...that would've been perfect.

39:00.003 --> 39:01.471
He's not coming down.

39:02.806 --> 39:06.275
Must be Thailand-hot
up there.

39:06.309 --> 39:09.611
That's why he likes it.

39:09.646 --> 39:13.716
Thailand's hot, right?

39:13.750 --> 39:14.984
Yeah.

39:15.018 --> 39:18.590
See? That's why.

39:18.625 --> 39:20.028
Oh, Jesus.

39:20.062 --> 39:21.464
Hey, wait.

39:21.498 --> 39:23.501
Here.

39:37.351 --> 39:39.882
He's not coming down.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.092
He's staying up there forever.

40:09.286 --> 40:11.787
What are you--
What are you doing?

40:11.822 --> 40:14.787
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.356
Uh...

40:20.024 --> 40:22.692
No, you're going to break
your neck.

40:22.726 --> 40:24.693
Yeah, yeah. Just--

40:26.962 --> 40:29.697
No, seriously, you're--
This is a bad idea.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.366
Damn it.

40:33.702 --> 40:35.102
Jesse.

40:35.136 --> 40:36.436
Just hold onto it.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.571
Hold it still?

40:52.751 --> 40:54.418
Jesse.

40:59.189 --> 41:00.723
I'm sorry.

41:00.757 --> 41:02.458
Sorry for what?

41:02.492 --> 41:03.626
Being a lunatic?

41:07.998 --> 41:09.665
I'm sorry about Jane.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.443
Yeah. Me, too.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.482
No, I mean, uh--

41:28.153 --> 41:31.288
I'm very sorry.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.095
It's not your fault.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.366
But it's not mine either.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.501
It's no one's fault,

41:45.535 --> 41:47.436
not even hers.

41:54.072 --> 41:55.835
Sucker's just sitting there.

41:58.770 --> 42:02.841
We are who we are, Mr. White.

42:02.876 --> 42:05.510
You know, just two junkies

42:05.544 --> 42:08.613
with a duffel bag full of cash.

42:08.648 --> 42:10.249
Like you said,

42:10.284 --> 42:12.218
we both would've been dead
within a week.

42:14.087 --> 42:15.720
But I miss her, though.

42:20.259 --> 42:21.859
God, I do.

42:30.367 --> 42:34.035
Jesse, come down.

42:34.069 --> 42:37.371
Wait, I am so close.

42:40.107 --> 42:42.840
Let it go.

42:42.874 --> 42:44.375
We need to cook.

42:45.377 --> 42:47.244
What about the contamination?

42:49.113 --> 42:50.814
It's all contaminated.

42:59.891 --> 43:01.525
I definitely scared him.

43:04.129 --> 43:06.163
Probably stay out of our way--

43:10.634 --> 43:12.435
God.

43:37.132 --> 43:38.367
Yeah!

43:38.402 --> 43:42.004
Zap! Somebody got got, yo!

43:42.039 --> 43:43.072
You see that, Mister--

44:31.256 --> 44:32.823
Bins are packed?

44:32.857 --> 44:34.891
Bins are packed.

44:36.527 --> 44:38.195
How's the yield?

44:38.229 --> 44:41.498
Two-oh-two and change.

44:41.532 --> 44:43.166
You okay getting home?

44:43.200 --> 44:45.602
Yeah. Better.

44:45.636 --> 44:46.770
Thanks.

44:46.804 --> 44:48.471
<i>Mañana, then.</i>

45:03.387 --> 45:06.355
Jesse, come here.

45:09.559 --> 45:11.626
I couldn't chance
saying it inside.

45:11.661 --> 45:14.862
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

45:16.665 --> 45:21.968
That half a pound
that I said we're off by--

45:22.002 --> 45:25.404
Now, I'm not accusing you,
but if...

45:26.639 --> 45:27.606
You understand?

45:27.640 --> 45:29.708
And if they
ever found out--

45:33.379 --> 45:35.747
I didn't take shit.

45:40.954 --> 45:44.289
I'm just saying that I won't
be able to protect you.

45:45.392 --> 45:47.960
Who's asking you to?
