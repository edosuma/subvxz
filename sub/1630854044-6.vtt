at this point

02:08.562 --> 02:09.294
is to be self-sufficient.

02:09.330 --> 02:09.661
We gotta take care
of ourselves.

This mill...

This mill got value

02:10.631 --> 02:10.996
and it's ours

02:11.031 --> 02:11.797
if we want it

02:11.832 --> 02:12.531
to get from charlie,
to the co-op.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.398

about trying

02:13.434 --> 02:13.966
to start this thing
up again, are you?

02:14.001 --> 02:14.933
[darla] no. Just for now,

02:14.969 --> 02:15.567
the co-op will use it
to build our inventory

02:15.603 --> 02:16.201
and add to our overholdings.

02:16.237 --> 02:16.869
Move the books to our gains

02:16.904 --> 02:17.469
and we ain't gotta pay for it.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.403
Right. We just maintain it

02:18.439 --> 02:19.071
and reap the benefits
of the tax advantage

02:19.106 --> 02:20.072
while showing that we control

02:20.107 --> 02:20.739
a very large and potentially
lucrative company.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.406
But who's gonna look after it?

02:21.442 --> 02:22.074
None of us got time for that.

02:22.109 --> 02:22.941
Yeah. It's gonna need tending

02:22.977 --> 02:23.976
whether it's operating
or not, won't it?

02:24.011 --> 02:24.977

charlie the first time.

02:25.012 --> 02:25.711
She know this place better
than anybody, right?

02:25.746 --> 02:26.778
Mmm-hmm.
I'm just gonna tidy it up

02:26.814 --> 02:27.679
and make it look good
and clean for any investors

02:27.715 --> 02:28.413

who might be in our future.

ms. Darla.

what you've be doing,

02:30.050 --> 02:30.749
you know, with the books,
whatnot,

02:30.784 --> 02:31.283
but getting a mill
on its feet,

02:31.318 --> 02:32.317

about sprucing it up

02:34.221 --> 02:34.853
and sitting on it.

02:34.889 --> 02:35.487
And that's a good thought now

02:35.523 --> 02:36.288
that we don't have my farm.

02:36.323 --> 02:36.822
We need to show
that we have land.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.656
This is a good piece.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.323
If I'm still a member
of this co-op,

02:38.359 --> 02:38.390
I vote that we lean into this.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.125
And now that I have time
on my hands,

02:40.161 --> 02:40.959
-I hope you'll let me help.
-Appreciate that.

02:40.995 --> 02:41.793
-Thank you.
-That's all well and good

02:41.829 --> 02:42.461
but somebody's gonna have
to be there.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.095
-Yeah.
-She's still talking

02:43.130 --> 02:43.495
about letting people come in

02:43.531 --> 02:44.029

This must be the wonder kid.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.367
Oh, no, man.
I don't know about that

02:48.402 --> 02:48.901
but I am excited
to talk to you.

02:48.936 --> 02:49.668
You're last nft, fire.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.602
-Thank you.
-[man] what's next?

02:50.638 --> 02:51.003
You got anything
from when your mom paid off

02:51.038 --> 02:51.069
that side piece?

02:52.106 --> 02:52.704
Nah, I don't... I don't have
anything like that.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.372
Yeah. My bad. No disrespect.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.039
I just thought it made sense,

02:54.074 --> 02:54.106
you know, after the first one.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.807
Yeah. Uh, micah's
next few projects

02:55.843 --> 02:56.575
are gonna be capitalized
on his mom's campaign.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.643
Really?
Now, that is interesting.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.544
You know, political nfts
are kind of a landmine, man.

02:58.579 --> 02:58.944
But when they explode...
[mimics explosion]

02:58.979 --> 02:59.745
[man chuckles]

02:59.780 --> 03:00.345
-so what's the angle?
-All right.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.013
Well, I'm all about moving

03:01.048 --> 03:01.313
the culture forward, you know?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.381
So, uh...

03:02.416 --> 03:03.182
I've been studying with this
guy named rahad stevens.

03:03.217 --> 03:03.982
-He's a photographer.
-[man] ooh.

03:04.018 --> 03:04.716
[man] all his stuff
is next level.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.517
You know,
it's about disrupting,

03:05.553 --> 03:06.318
reclaiming,
rewriting the narrative.

03:06.353 --> 03:06.385
Disrupting, reclaim.
That is dope.

03:06.820 --> 03:06.852
We rolling, boys?

03:07.421 --> 03:07.886
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

03:07.922 --> 03:07.953
Gotta relax, relate.

03:08.222 --> 03:08.253
Micah?

03:08.522 --> 03:08.554
Um...

03:08.923 --> 03:09.221
Yeah, yeah.

03:09.256 --> 03:09.888
All right.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.422
That's what I'm talking about.

03:10.457 --> 03:10.489
Let's make some money.

03:11.358 --> 03:11.723
Let me give you this mail
before I forget.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.558
Oh, thank you.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.091
I'm, uh, still switching
everything over.

03:13.127 --> 03:13.926
Look, take your time.

03:13.961 --> 03:13.992
I'm just glad
you all are still close.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.294
We missed you. Hmm?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.061
That house is so quiet
without true.

03:16.096 --> 03:16.728
I almost overslept
this morning.

03:16.764 --> 03:16.795
She was my little alarm clock.

03:17.364 --> 03:17.396
Six o'clock on the dot.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.564
All right.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.231
So here is your gross
for last month,

03:19.266 --> 03:19.765
minus supplies and expensive,

03:19.800 --> 03:20.566
and that is your profit.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.500
All that
is from the farmer's market?

03:21.535 --> 03:22.134
Oh, my god, violet,
you pretty much sell out

03:22.169 --> 03:22.201
within the hour, every time.

03:23.003 --> 03:23.602
-It's something, ain't it?
-Mmm-hmm.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.002
Folks lining up for my pies.

03:24.038 --> 03:24.903
For your pies.

03:24.939 --> 03:25.470
You know, sometimes
we get so caught up

03:25.506 --> 03:26.405
striving for our dreams

03:26.440 --> 03:26.672
that we forget
we're living inside of them.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.606
Mmm-hmm.

03:27.641 --> 03:27.673
We human beings
always want more and more.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.241
Sometimes you just have to sit

03:29.276 --> 03:29.308
with people that we love
and take it all in.

03:29.944 --> 03:30.309
Baby, two favorites, please.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.410
[woman] mmm-hmm.

03:31.445 --> 03:31.944
Are we about to have some
blue's berries pies, madam?

03:31.979 --> 03:32.477
Yes, we are, my dear.

03:32.513 --> 03:32.544
It's our best seller.

03:32.947 --> 03:32.978
Thank you, baby.

03:33.414 --> 03:33.445
Thank you, darla.

03:33.981 --> 03:34.780
Vi's pies would not be

03:34.815 --> 03:35.414
on this track
if it weren't for you.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.248
Your farmer's market vision

03:36.283 --> 03:36.315
gave us a whole
new revenue stream.

03:37.184 --> 03:37.216
I wish everyone saw me
the way you do.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.684
All right.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.718
Tell me which one of those
old farmers has doubt in you.

03:39.753 --> 03:39.785
Give me his name so I can
talk some sense into him.

03:40.287 --> 03:40.786
I just get so tired

03:40.821 --> 03:41.286
having to prove myself

03:41.322 --> 03:41.353
over and over again.

03:41.655 --> 03:41.687
Me too.

03:42.122 --> 03:42.888
But we persist,

03:42.923 --> 03:43.755
'cause we gotta do
what we gotta do.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.156
And right this moment
what we got to do

03:44.191 --> 03:44.223
is eat some pie.

03:44.592 --> 03:44.623
Yes, we do.

03:44.858 --> 03:45.591
Hey.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.225
Nova, hey.
Thanks for coming early.

03:46.260 --> 03:46.291
Of course. Everything okay?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.626
I'm getting complaints.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.493
Some of the parents
are up in arms

03:48.529 --> 03:49.261
about you speaking here,
calling it crt.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.195
-United states history?
-Exactly.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.263
Now, my hands
as a teacher here are tied,

03:51.298 --> 03:52.431
but I won't let them tie up
my voice as a citizen.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.532
There has to be some way to
resist this from the inside.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.533
Well, my first instinct
is to fight fire with fire,

03:54.568 --> 03:55.500
but I don't wanna put you
or your job in danger.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.401
I don't think teaching history
as it happened

03:56.437 --> 03:56.802
should be predicated
on anyone's comfort.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.469
-Hmm.
-But

03:57.504 --> 03:57.970
this is what we're up against,

03:58.005 --> 03:58.403
if you're up for it.

03:58.439 --> 03:58.470
I am, definitely.

like this when we're married?

04:32.106 --> 04:32.137
As long as leon's open,
you can count on it.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.639
Oh, uh...

04:33.674 --> 04:34.273
Billie is picking up supplies
for your, big party tomorrow.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.140
[woman] oh. I never imagine

04:35.175 --> 04:35.207
having a bachelorette party
at my age.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.742
What about you?

04:36.777 --> 04:37.309
Is ralph angel and hollywood
putting out all the stops?

04:37.344 --> 04:37.943
Nah. Nothing too fancy.

04:37.978 --> 04:38.010
Just some guys hanging out.

04:38.412 --> 04:38.443
No strippers?

04:39.446 --> 04:39.978
You don't have anything
to worry about, dear.

04:40.014 --> 04:40.779
-Mmm-hmm.
-No, no way

04:40.814 --> 04:41.513
hollywood pull
something like that

04:41.548 --> 04:42.047
and have to answer
to vi after.

04:42.082 --> 04:42.814
That man ain't crazy.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.682
Now parthena,
on the other hand,

04:43.717 --> 04:44.182
she gonna hire
every stripper in st. Joe

04:44.218 --> 04:44.783
to be at your party.

04:44.818 --> 04:44.850
Oh. So how many are there?

04:45.953 --> 04:45.984
You sure you're okay with
how fast all this is moving?

04:46.854 --> 04:46.885
Why would you ask
a question like that?

04:47.554 --> 04:47.586
You know how I feel about you.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.154
You know, I know
I proposed early on

04:49.189 --> 04:50.155
because I've been
around long enough

04:50.190 --> 04:51.023
to know that what we have
don't come that often

04:51.058 --> 04:51.256
and I don't wanna miss
a minute of it.

04:51.292 --> 04:51.323
Oh.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.157
Me neither, honey.

04:52.192 --> 04:52.791
This isn't fast.

04:52.826 --> 04:52.858
This right here is perfect.

04:53.460 --> 04:53.959
So we got chloe and halle,

04:53.994 --> 04:54.793
megan, billie eilish.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.227
Who else are you guys
listening to?

04:55.262 --> 04:55.761
Cordae, dababy,

04:55.796 --> 04:56.161
jack harlow, lil durk.

04:56.196 --> 04:56.628
Oh, all right.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.162
Rnb, pop, hip-hop.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.230
You have great taste.

04:58.265 --> 04:58.297
Does anyone know what these
genres have in common?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.098
They can all trace their roots
back to the blues.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.099
Same with country, rock,
even k-pop.

05:01.135 --> 05:01.900
And before the blues,
there were ring shouts.

05:01.935 --> 05:02.567
That's a ritual
that was performed

05:02.603 --> 05:02.968
by enslaved people in america.

05:03.003 --> 05:03.035
You mean slaves?

05:03.871 --> 05:04.636
Well, I prefer
to call our ancestors

05:04.672 --> 05:05.504
enslaved people
instead of slaves.

05:05.539 --> 05:05.971
The word slaves continues
to strip them

05:06.006 --> 05:06.405
of their humanity.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.172
They were people.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.273
Not property,
not animals, okay?

05:08.309 --> 05:09.341
So ring shouts were super
revolutionary and dangerous.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.442
The church back then banned us
from using our drums

05:10.477 --> 05:11.209
so we made rhythms with
our hands and feet instead.

05:11.245 --> 05:11.843
We would chant our prayers
and move

05:11.879 --> 05:12.577
in a counterclockwise circle

05:12.613 --> 05:13.478
without ever crossing
our feet,

05:13.514 --> 05:14.079
because that will be
considered dancing,

05:14.114 --> 05:14.146
and dancing was forbidden.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.147
Now, check this out.

05:15.182 --> 05:15.714
This is john lee hooker,

05:15.749 --> 05:16.181
blues singer, songwriter,

05:16.216 --> 05:16.982
guitarist, legend.

05:17.017 --> 05:17.949
And that chalkboard
behind him shows

05:17.985 --> 05:18.817
how the ring shout gave birth
to spirituals,

05:18.852 --> 05:19.618
which laid the foundation
for the blues

05:19.653 --> 05:20.619
and every other genre
after that.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.486
Now, I want you to listen
to your favorite song

05:21.522 --> 05:22.421
and then listen
to an old blues song.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.255
Pay attention to the guitars
and the rhythms.

05:23.290 --> 05:23.822
See if you can hear
the similarities.

05:23.857 --> 05:23.889
You might be surprised.

05:24.291 --> 05:24.323
I'm darla and...

05:24.725 --> 05:24.756
I'm an addict.

05:25.159 --> 05:25.190
I've been, um,

05:25.959 --> 05:26.825
dealing with someone
from my past

05:26.860 --> 05:26.892
and I've been hiding it
from my husband

05:27.695 --> 05:27.726
because I don't know
what he'll do.

05:28.162 --> 05:28.193
I take that back.

05:28.996 --> 05:29.027
I don't know
all of what he'll do.

05:29.830 --> 05:29.861
Now, I know
that he will love me,

05:30.230 --> 05:31.263
forgive me,

05:31.298 --> 05:31.330
but I don't know what
he'll do to the other person

05:32.132 --> 05:32.864
and I don't want him
doing anything

05:32.900 --> 05:32.931
that'll get
himself in trouble.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.333
He has worked so hard.

05:34.368 --> 05:34.399
Are you afraid
you're going to use again?

05:34.835 --> 05:34.866
Today was hard.

05:35.369 --> 05:35.400
It was really hard.

05:35.669 --> 05:35.701
I, uh,

05:36.270 --> 05:36.301
I almost stopped at a bar

05:36.837 --> 05:36.868
but I came here instead.

05:37.271 --> 05:37.302
But I was close.

05:38.205 --> 05:38.236
I know he's gonna ask me
what triggered me.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.538
I can't tell him.

05:39.573 --> 05:39.604
Keeping secrets
is like keeping poison.

05:40.140 --> 05:40.839
Can you consider a way

05:40.874 --> 05:40.906
that you can unburden
yourself?

05:41.508 --> 05:41.540
Share your truth with him.

05:41.809 --> 05:41.840
Maybe.

05:42.476 --> 05:42.708
I can't say that right now.

05:42.743 --> 05:42.774
But, uh,

05:43.444 --> 05:43.709
I'll try to think it through.

05:43.744 --> 05:43.775
I'll try.

05:44.278 --> 05:44.309
It's just that, um,

05:44.845 --> 05:44.876
we've worked really hard

05:45.612 --> 05:45.644
to get to where
we're at, and...

05:46.213 --> 05:46.244
We're at a shaky at best.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.679
It's already been so hard.

05:47.715 --> 05:47.746
I can't, um,
risk one more thing, so...

05:48.248 --> 05:48.280
I'll think about it.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.481
[chuckles, sniffles]

05:49.516 --> 05:49.548
thank you
for letting me share.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.551
bro, you are killing it
right now.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.318
The guy said
he's willing to buy

05:53.354 --> 05:54.252
five pieces
sight unseen. Yeah.

05:54.288 --> 05:54.853
How are you feeling
about life right now?

05:54.888 --> 05:55.387
Oh, it's pretty all right.

05:55.422 --> 05:55.921
That was really good.

05:55.956 --> 05:56.455
Yo, we're a good team.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.289
This could be a thing.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.390
We'll have private jets,
vip sections.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.291
Now, all we gotta do is keep
selling that fire, bro.

05:59.326 --> 05:59.358
Make your own money,
make your own mark.

Micah west.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.626
-Would you like a pic?
-Yeah.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.294
-Okay.
-Yeah, squeeze in, squeeze in.

06:02.329 --> 06:02.361
Of course. Micah, right here.

06:03.163 --> 06:03.195
Hey, y'all look great,
by the way.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.229
[woman 1] thanks. Bye, micah.

06:04.264 --> 06:04.296
[woman 2] bye.

06:04.998 --> 06:05.831
-Hey, excuse me.
-[woman] yeah?

06:05.866 --> 06:06.298
Can I get another round
for everybody?

06:06.333 --> 06:06.832
I mean, everybody.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.466
Try putting it on there.

06:07.501 --> 06:07.999
Buy you all shots. Everyone.

06:08.035 --> 06:08.433
[cheers and applause]

06:08.902 --> 06:08.934
[song continues]

06:09.336 --> 06:09.368
are you done?

06:10.337 --> 06:10.936
Now, I don't wanna do
this here, but I will.

06:10.971 --> 06:11.903
Uh, excuse me. Who are you?

06:11.939 --> 06:12.304
Yo, chill, man.
That's... She's my grandma.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.004
Let's go... Now.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.839

06:13.874 --> 06:13.905

06:14.475 --> 06:15.240
how did you even find me?

06:15.275 --> 06:16.208
Those random people
that you're with

06:16.243 --> 06:16.775
kept taking pictures
and tagging your parents.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.309
And your mother called me

06:17.344 --> 06:18.043
and asked me to find you

06:18.078 --> 06:18.844
before you create
another mess.

06:18.879 --> 06:18.910
-Are they mad?
-What do you think?

06:19.847 --> 06:19.878
-Where are you going?
-The guest bedroom.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.279
-I'm exhausted.
-Uh-uh.

06:21.315 --> 06:21.847
Now, I drove
all the way to hollywood

06:21.882 --> 06:22.714
to retrieve my grandson

06:22.750 --> 06:23.648
who I've not seen
in person in two years

06:23.684 --> 06:24.750
and seven months
and who's gonna fix his face

06:24.785 --> 06:24.816
and he's gonna explain himself
before he goes anywhere.

06:25.786 --> 06:25.817
Now, drink that please.
You look dehydrated.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.352
Why aren't you returning
your parents calls?

06:27.388 --> 06:27.419
I didn't wanna bother them.

06:28.021 --> 06:28.053
You don't wanna face them.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.354
What were you thinking?

06:29.390 --> 06:30.222
It's art, grandma.
It's subversive.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.022
I was trying
to reclaim our pain and...

06:31.058 --> 06:31.089
[sighs] you just
wouldn't understand.

06:31.458 --> 06:31.490
This is art.

06:32.192 --> 06:32.924
-You kept that?
-Of course.

06:32.960 --> 06:32.991
You were so excited
to show me.

06:34.027 --> 06:34.059
You sent that fedex
so I'd get it the next day.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.360
You have a gift, micah.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.395
You see things
other people don't

06:36.430 --> 06:36.461
and you make us stop
and pay attention to things.

06:37.131 --> 06:37.629
But be careful how you use it.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.397
[dramatic music playing]

06:38.432 --> 06:38.463
I just don't know
where I fit in.

06:39.099 --> 06:39.831
You know, dad has basketball

06:39.867 --> 06:39.898
and mom
has always been a boss.

06:40.968 --> 06:41.800
You're not the first person
to hit a rough patch,

06:41.835 --> 06:42.701
but there's a difference
between passion

06:42.736 --> 06:42.768
and purpose and posturing
and pretending.

06:43.604 --> 06:43.635
You're too brilliant
to be the latter.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.036
And when I saw what you did
with that horrible,

06:45.072 --> 06:45.704
that hurtful nft

06:45.739 --> 06:46.104
and with those people tonight,

06:46.140 --> 06:46.171
that is not you.

06:46.707 --> 06:46.738
That is not your spirit.

06:47.374 --> 06:47.406
That is not from your heart.

06:48.375 --> 06:48.407
How much did you make
selling that nft anyway?

06:48.709 --> 06:49.207
$200,000.

06:49.243 --> 06:49.274
That's a lot of money.

06:49.576 --> 06:49.608
[sighs]

06:50.677 --> 06:50.709
but was it worth the price
of your mother's tears?

06:51.478 --> 06:51.510
Tell me
what you've been up to?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.178
I've been working on bringing
the grocery to lower 9th.

06:53.213 --> 06:53.979
Yeah, we have a meeting

06:54.014 --> 06:54.880
with the regional manager
next week.

06:54.915 --> 06:55.981
She the last person
who gotta sign off.

06:56.016 --> 06:56.848
Too's been helping me get
the paperwork squared away.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.983

education to work.

06:58.018 --> 06:58.417

to make changes on the ground.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.251
[both chuckles]

06:59.286 --> 07:00.318
so what you've
been up to these days?

07:00.354 --> 07:01.386
You're always working
on something for the people.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.354
I just finished a series
on the<i> thibodaux massacre.</i>

07:02.389 --> 07:02.821
I had an offer
to turn my book into a movie,

07:02.856 --> 07:03.388
but that's on ice.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.289
I'm not sure what's next.

07:04.324 --> 07:04.689
I'm feeling
a little aimless, honestly.

07:04.725 --> 07:04.756
A movie deal?

07:05.025 --> 07:05.056
Damn.

07:06.093 --> 07:06.658
You really did get fancy
since you left the knight.

07:06.693 --> 07:06.725
Hey, it's not being fancy.

07:07.661 --> 07:07.993
I just wanted to keep
growing and expand.

07:08.028 --> 07:08.860
I hear you.

07:08.896 --> 07:08.927
I wasn't trying
to say nothing sideways.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.362
But if you wanna grow,

07:10.397 --> 07:10.429
you have to tend
to your roots on the ground.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.130
-You talked to your ol' boy?
-[keke] mmm-hmm.

07:12.166 --> 07:12.197
-[indistinct]
-[keke chuckles] oh.

07:12.933 --> 07:13.365
Not since
he turned himself in.

07:13.400 --> 07:13.865
Turned himself in?

07:13.901 --> 07:14.933
[sighs] ceremonial.

07:14.968 --> 07:15.300
That's sound like a tv show
designed just for you.

07:15.335 --> 07:15.367
Yeah. Maybe.

07:16.036 --> 07:16.735
-So what happened?
-Nothing.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.702
You know,
blue protects itself.

07:17.738 --> 07:17.769
Last I heard,
he moved back to baton rouge.

07:18.305 --> 07:18.336
Don't know much else.

07:19.072 --> 07:19.104
I was a man's man
for a minute.

07:19.740 --> 07:19.771
You done with that for good?

07:20.507 --> 07:21.039
-I got a new somebody.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:21.074 --> 07:21.473
And it's really strong.

07:21.508 --> 07:21.807
Mmm-hmm. Black?

07:21.842 --> 07:22.040
[laughter]

07:22.075 --> 07:22.107
yes.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.508
Okay. [laughs] okay. Okay.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.042
I'm just saying.
Black love is beautiful.

07:24.077 --> 07:24.109
Oh, love is beautiful.

07:25.012 --> 07:25.043
If you can get it
from anywhere, grab it.

07:25.312 --> 07:25.343
Word.

07:25.913 --> 07:26.478
-You're right.
-Yeah.

07:26.513 --> 07:26.812
That's how I live my life.

07:26.847 --> 07:26.878
[laughter]

07:27.281 --> 07:27.312
[ralph sighs]

07:28.048 --> 07:28.814
-is she asleep?
-Knocked out.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.080
I see billie
got you on balloon duty.

07:29.116 --> 07:29.714
I am.

07:29.750 --> 07:29.781
I got this for you to blow.

07:30.350 --> 07:30.382
You're quiet all night.

07:31.251 --> 07:31.283
[clear throat]
ready to talk about it?

07:31.552 --> 07:31.583
The, um,

07:32.619 --> 07:32.651
the reason why I missed
true's appointment today,

07:33.187 --> 07:33.218
I went into a meeting.

07:33.620 --> 07:33.652
Did you slip?

07:33.887 --> 07:33.919
No.

07:34.721 --> 07:34.753
I got ahead of it
before I relapsed.

07:35.689 --> 07:35.954
Because of what happened
earlier at the mill?

07:35.989 --> 07:36.021
No. Um...

07:36.457 --> 07:36.988
More than that.

07:37.024 --> 07:37.823
Um, it's a lot of things.

07:37.858 --> 07:37.889
Every time I keep
something from you,

07:38.525 --> 07:38.557
it always ends up messed up.

07:39.193 --> 07:39.224
Take some advice from a pro.

07:39.526 --> 07:39.558
You good?

07:40.160 --> 07:40.192
It's just a lot of things.

07:40.694 --> 07:40.725
I'm not gonna push.

07:41.195 --> 07:41.226
[darla] thank you.

07:41.762 --> 07:42.627
Effective immediately.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.695
Sha said he'll let me know
in a few weeks

07:43.730 --> 07:44.329
whether they'll lift the
suspension or terminate me.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.130
We're getting death threats

07:45.165 --> 07:45.797
for teaching
the history of music.

07:45.833 --> 07:46.665
We're talking about the blues.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.332
They're calling
a school board meeting

07:47.367 --> 07:47.866
to vote on banning your work,

07:47.901 --> 07:48.400
along with toni morrison

07:48.435 --> 07:48.834
and now john lee hooker.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.634
This is insane.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.535
Actual insanity.
We can't back down.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.536
No way. We need
to focus on making sure

07:51.572 --> 07:52.437
our allies on the school board
keep their seats.

07:52.473 --> 07:52.904
Yeah. No, I know
some folks who can help us

07:52.940 --> 07:53.505
get that boat out.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.306
They crossed the wrong one

07:54.341 --> 07:54.973
in the wrong
small louisiana town.

07:55.008 --> 07:55.040
-Sounds right to me.
-Hmm.

07:55.442 --> 07:55.474
Good morning.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.209
I just wanted
to say thanks again.

07:57.244 --> 07:57.642
You still need
to apologize to your parents.

07:57.678 --> 07:57.709
I know. I will.

07:58.679 --> 07:58.977
Do you know when
they get back from the border?

07:59.012 --> 07:59.845
Next week.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.145
But you need
to call them this morning.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.146
I will.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.214
'cause they're making
a real difference, micah.

08:02.249 --> 08:02.948
Their name value is
drawing such needed attention

08:02.983 --> 08:03.482
and all this
that you are doing

08:03.517 --> 08:03.548
is just pulling focus.

08:03.817 --> 08:03.849
Wait.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.450
You know rahad stevens.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.384
It's crazy. I'm taking
a class with him right now.

08:06.420 --> 08:06.451
Well, when I saw it,
it reminded me of you.

08:07.020 --> 08:07.052
That's why I bought it.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.386
That's dope, grandma.

08:08.422 --> 08:08.453
You know you never
cease to amaze me.

08:09.156 --> 08:09.187
-Yes. Good.
-[micah chuckles]

08:09.590 --> 08:10.455
I just feel like

08:10.491 --> 08:10.856
if I can make half
the impact with my art

08:10.891 --> 08:10.922
that he has...

08:11.225 --> 08:12.224
You will.

08:12.259 --> 08:12.290
You're just saying that
'cause you're my grandma.

08:12.860 --> 08:13.492
If I wasn't your grandma,

08:13.527 --> 08:14.226
I would be saving up right now

08:14.261 --> 08:15.427
to buy my own
micah west piece.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.261
And since I am your grandma,
I better get a good discount.

08:16.296 --> 08:16.328
-I'll overnight it to you.
-Oh. Yeah.

08:16.597 --> 08:16.628
Yeah.

08:17.464 --> 08:17.829
-[laughter]
-[upbeat music playing]

08:17.865 --> 08:18.597
[tina] maybe.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.331
Oh, with a little
hip action now.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.065
-All right. Okay.
-Okay. Ladies.

08:20.100 --> 08:20.131
-Go ahead.
-Mmm-hmm. I got one.

08:20.968 --> 08:20.999
Never have I ever
been nude in public.

08:21.268 --> 08:21.299
Uh...

08:22.269 --> 08:22.868
[charley] uh, what?
What was you doing now?

08:22.903 --> 08:23.802
Don't worry about all that.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.669
-[laughter]
-seems like I'm the only here

08:24.705 --> 08:25.537
-who's lived a full life.
-So I thought

08:25.572 --> 08:26.171
I was doing all right
but I see I got

08:26.206 --> 08:26.872
a lot of catching up to do.

08:26.907 --> 08:26.938
-All right, then.
-We all do.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.007
Ladies, I have to tell you
it is so wonderful.

08:29.042 --> 08:29.841
I know that this party
is for sandy but I needed it.

08:29.877 --> 08:29.908
It's been so long
since I've laughed.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.109
And the only thing

08:31.144 --> 08:31.776
that would make
this any better

08:31.812 --> 08:32.110
would be one or two strippers.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.044
[laughter]

08:33.080 --> 08:33.812
I don't know
how joaquin and dante got you

08:33.847 --> 08:34.846
to sleep this early.
They did it.

08:34.882 --> 08:35.680
Joaquin was extra salty.
He had to babysit tonight.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.314
That boy actually
thought he was going

08:36.350 --> 08:36.948
to his first bachelor party.

08:36.984 --> 08:37.649
I'mma rub it in to him too.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.183
I'mma tell him
it's wild night.

08:38.218 --> 08:38.884
[laughs] yeah, we sure

08:38.919 --> 08:39.584
had some those
back in the day.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.018
-[hollywood] mmm-hmm.
-[sighs]

08:40.053 --> 08:40.719
but now I'm happy

08:40.754 --> 08:41.553
just hanging out
with you fellas.

08:41.588 --> 08:42.487
Yeah, we glad to be
with you tonight.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.255
-To you, mr. Prosper.
-Yes. And this guy.

08:43.290 --> 08:43.955
Benny!
Bring the cards out, baby.

08:43.991 --> 08:44.489
-[benny] oh.
-Hey. Listen, uh,

08:44.525 --> 08:44.556
can I ask you something?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.091
-You okay, mr. Prosper?
-Yeah. Yeah.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.092
Look, ernest
was my best friend

08:47.127 --> 08:47.158
and he was the best man
when I married clair.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.160
And it would mean a lot
if you stood up there with me

08:49.196 --> 08:49.227
when I marry sandy
in place of your father.

08:49.596 --> 08:49.628
You serious?

08:50.597 --> 08:50.629
I mean, that would be
a honor, mr. Prosper.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.130
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.064
You doing it, huh?
Congratulations.

08:53.100 --> 08:53.832
-Thank you, prosper.
-Thank you. Thank you.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.165
Never thought
I'd be here again.

08:54.201 --> 08:54.833
I got you.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.133
[exhales] couldn't be happier.

08:55.168 --> 08:55.200
To you.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.067
[laughter]

08:56.103 --> 08:56.868
you know, I never thought

08:56.904 --> 08:56.935
that I would be 42
and single again.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.036
Girl, 42,
you're just getting started.

08:58.071 --> 08:58.870
Trust me.

08:58.906 --> 08:59.938
Listen, finding love
at a seasoned age

08:59.973 --> 09:00.205
is one of the greatest
surprises life has to offer.

09:00.240 --> 09:00.272
Mmm-hmm.

09:00.941 --> 09:01.406
I would never have appreciated

09:01.441 --> 09:02.240
a man like hollywood

09:02.276 --> 09:02.307
-when I was young and dumb.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.109
Age brings freedom
because you don't have time

09:04.144 --> 09:05.076
to worry about
what other people think.

09:05.112 --> 09:05.677
Mmm-hmm. Freedom makes it
all so much better.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.244
Oh, honey, and the loving.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.012
[tina laughs] yes. Yes.

09:07.047 --> 09:07.412
I don't think
I need to hear it.

09:07.447 --> 09:07.746
-Yes.
-No.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.713
[laughter]

09:08.749 --> 09:09.648
I wonder if the guys
are having this much fun?

09:09.683 --> 09:09.714
Well, there's one way
for us to find out.

09:10.450 --> 09:10.482
-All right. I'll drive.
-Yay!

09:10.851 --> 09:11.249
[tina] okay.

09:11.285 --> 09:11.883

09:12.319 --> 09:13.351
I don't know.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.519
All right. Now, I told sandy
there weren't gonna be

09:14.555 --> 09:15.654
no strippers so none of y'all
brought no strippers here.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.321
