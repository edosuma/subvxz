00:01.722 --> 00:05.141
Mr Grove's wife, Harriet, died in her
sleep last night.

00:05.158 --> 00:07.520
You don't steal from your work
family.

00:07.557 --> 00:09.674
I am so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

00:09.675 --> 00:11.875
Come with me to Paris.
No.

00:11.876 --> 00:15.394
Victor, do you want to do something
after work tonight, then?

00:15.395 --> 00:17.553
I can't tonight. Maybe another night.

00:17.554 --> 00:21.513
He's taking it bad, isn't he, your
Mr Leclair? He's not my Mr Leclair.

00:21.514 --> 00:24.313
The night he crashed the motor he'd
been gambling at the club.

00:24.314 --> 00:27.234
He was knocking back the whiskey.
Toasting his father.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.835
Your pa ain't no war hero. He ain't
dead either.

00:39.556 --> 00:41.556
Harry!

00:52.756 --> 00:55.834
Harry! Whatever are you doing?
I had this idea.

00:55.835 --> 00:58.755
Put the clocks forward, buy us an
extra five minutes!

01:00.395 --> 01:04.114
Why can't you sleep? Is it those
hallucinations again? Those
nightmares?

01:04.114 --> 01:07.756
I'm fine, Rose. Just full of beans,
is all. You know me!

01:08.755 --> 01:10.755
Come back to bed.

01:12.675 --> 01:15.233
You know, there was this moment
there

01:15.234 --> 01:19.193
when I thought how am I going to
live without this crazy man?

01:19.194 --> 01:21.995
I'm so sorry that I put you all
through hell.

01:23.236 --> 01:29.235
And you have my solemn promise that I
intend driving you crazy for a long
time.

01:34.035 --> 01:36.036
Don't go in today.

01:36.636 --> 01:38.676
Give us one more day together.

01:38.677 --> 01:41.756
How about you come in for lunch
instead?

01:43.316 --> 01:45.915
Yes. She likes the idea.

01:45.916 --> 01:50.636
And what if she can get her books
signed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a
bonus?

01:52.795 --> 01:54.635
Yes.

01:54.636 --> 02:00.035
Meantime, if you really can't sleep
and you intend driving me crazy...

02:33.836 --> 02:36.115
Look our best for Mr Selfridge's
return.

02:37.396 --> 02:40.115
He'll be a lucky man who gets you
for a wife, Aggie.

02:41.116 --> 02:43.113
No pastries from Victor in a while.

02:43.114 --> 02:45.915
I'm not looking to be anybody's wife
just now.

02:46.876 --> 02:50.514
But there's someone for everyone,
though George. For you, yeah.

02:50.515 --> 02:52.516
But who'd look at the likes of me?

02:53.716 --> 02:57.995
If you think like that, then you'll
never notice if someone's looking or
not.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.435
There!

03:10.516 --> 03:13.236
Little things can make a big
difference to a girl.

03:19.156 --> 03:21.156
Right, George.

03:26.035 --> 03:30.755
Kitty, polish that glass case again.
There cannot be a speck of dust on
it. Not a speck.

03:31.075 --> 03:33.035
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:34.196 --> 03:37.114
Careful, please, this is the
Selfridge's perfume.

03:37.115 --> 03:39.274
It has to be perfect.
Yes, Mr Leclair.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.314
Do we know? Is he in the building?

03:41.315 --> 03:43.516
Oh, we'll know. You can trust me on
that.

03:44.316 --> 03:46.236
Ladies, I was quite specific.

03:46.237 --> 03:50.075
We're on blue today. I said blue.
Look sharper, please.

03:51.475 --> 03:53.074
Does your heart good eh?

03:53.075 --> 03:56.513
I for one shall be relieved to hand
over the reins.

03:56.514 --> 04:00.314
Mr Crabb, I can only apologise if I
have not been quite myself.

04:00.315 --> 04:02.834
My dear Mr Grove. You are under
immense pressure.

04:02.835 --> 04:04.875
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

04:04.876 --> 04:07.194
Good morning, Mr Selfridge!

04:07.195 --> 04:11.395
Let's get those doors open, please!
Business as usual.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.996
Am I seeing right, Mr Crabb?
I'm afraid so Mr Grove.

04:15.997 --> 04:17.995
He's even faster!

04:23.075 --> 04:25.873
Good, good. Wouldn't want to see
standards slipping

04:25.874 --> 04:29.114
just because I wasn't here to check.
Of course not, Mr Selfridge.

04:29.115 --> 04:31.034
May I enquire as to your health,
today?

04:31.035 --> 04:33.634
Fit as a fiddle, thank you. Keep up
the good...

04:33.635 --> 04:37.594
Oh, I am so sorry. I don't know how
that slipped my attention.

04:37.595 --> 04:41.313
Get rid of it, please. I don't want
dead flowers in my store.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.476
That is not the signal we want to get
out.

04:43.477 --> 04:45.834
Back at the helm, old chap.

04:45.835 --> 04:49.915
With plans, Frank! Big plans.
Quite incorrigible.

04:49.916 --> 04:53.436
May I have a quote for our readers?
'Back to the brink' sort of thing?

04:53.437 --> 04:57.274
How about life is for living?

04:57.275 --> 04:59.835
I like it! Damn...
Sorry, Frank, can't stop!

04:59.836 --> 05:02.834
Sir Arthur!
Mr Selfridge!

05:02.835 --> 05:05.075
Good to see you in the land of the
living.

05:05.076 --> 05:08.076
I believe you had a very close call.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.555
I very much look forward to our
lunch.

05:11.556 --> 05:13.996
So do I, Sir Arthur. So do I.

05:15.795 --> 05:17.835
Fine man.

05:17.836 --> 05:22.475
Yes, Sherlock Holmes is not so much
a reward but an affliction.

05:32.956 --> 05:35.314
Can I help you, Mr Edwards?

05:35.315 --> 05:38.596
I'd like a set of your ivory-topped
pencils, please.

05:39.676 --> 05:41.676
Certainly, Mr Edwards.

05:50.916 --> 05:53.593
For your interview with Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle?

05:53.594 --> 05:57.076
I've read everything he's written,
Mr Edwards. Everything.

05:58.156 --> 06:01.276
Brains as well as the most beautiful
coloured hair.

06:02.475 --> 06:04.475
What would you call that?

06:05.915 --> 06:07.916
We call it strawberry blonde.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.714
Some ladies add dye to their hair
these days,

06:11.715 --> 06:14.116
but this is quite natural.

06:14.835 --> 06:17.716
Of course. For a natural beauty.

06:21.835 --> 06:23.835
I'll take them.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.916
Now I want you all to think.

06:32.116 --> 06:34.916
What could we do better? Where could
we be bigger?

06:34.917 --> 06:38.034
How can I personally improve my
department?

06:38.035 --> 06:41.554
Standing still is the same as being
dead in the water.

06:41.555 --> 06:44.154
I hardly think we stand still,
Mr Selfridge.

06:44.155 --> 06:46.074
No, I know that. It's just...

06:46.075 --> 06:49.833
if my accident has taught me one
thing, it's the future is now.

06:49.834 --> 06:52.315
I want you to think of new product
lines.

06:52.316 --> 06:54.755
Fresh and exciting suppliers.

06:54.756 --> 06:56.834
On we go!

06:56.835 --> 06:58.835
Miss Ravillious.

07:00.836 --> 07:04.713
I'm personally grateful for your
handling of the Suffragette crisis.

07:04.714 --> 07:07.836
If there's anything -
I'd like Miss Towler, if I may.

07:09.036 --> 07:11.274
She's one of our most talented
employees.

07:11.275 --> 07:13.756
And therefore will improve my
department.

07:13.757 --> 07:15.996
Mm.
Simple logic, really.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.874
There's something not right with
these straps.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.195
You're fussing. The dress is
exquisite.

07:23.196 --> 07:25.315
No, there's something...

07:25.316 --> 07:28.994
Ma, this isn't just any soiree
tomorrow, you know.

07:28.995 --> 07:32.275
Yes, I think we understand that,
Rosalie.

07:32.276 --> 07:34.313
A girl has to come out in London, Ma.

07:34.314 --> 07:36.474
Otherwise she's never going to fit
in.

07:36.475 --> 07:38.513
Maybe you and Harry should go.

07:38.514 --> 07:41.913
Lady Mae has offered to chaperone
Rosalie on this occasion.

07:41.914 --> 07:44.195
And I think it will do this one good.

07:45.275 --> 07:48.156
To hold her head up and be an
independent young lady.

07:49.356 --> 07:52.476
The strap is fine. The dress is fine.
You're fine.

07:52.477 --> 07:54.475
Now, go!

07:59.396 --> 08:01.396
Lois?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.715
Harry... I didn't see him before he
left this morning.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.354
He's fine.

08:07.355 --> 08:10.876
He's still having those nightmares,
isn't he? Lois, He's fine.

08:11.516 --> 08:13.635
Why does he take such risks?

08:13.636 --> 08:15.636
Speeding like that.

08:16.595 --> 08:18.635
I don't know what gets into him.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.036
I don't know. Maybe he's born that
way.

08:24.356 --> 08:28.154
Or you can blame yourself if it
makes you feel better.

08:28.155 --> 08:30.156
God knows it works for me.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.116
Harry!

08:39.315 --> 08:41.395
John. Good to see you.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.034
Just checking on my investment,
old boy.

08:44.035 --> 08:47.915
Gave us quite a scare,
I can tell you.

08:47.916 --> 08:50.436
All in a day's work,
keeping the press busy.

08:50.437 --> 08:53.235
So, what's new in the business
world?

08:53.236 --> 08:56.034
Well, there's talk about the adjacent
buildings.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.953
A developer sniffing.
I heard. Let him sniff.

08:58.954 --> 09:02.273
If we're to expand, we are going to
need those buildings next door.

09:02.274 --> 09:05.194
We've driven the prices so high this
end of Oxford Street

09:05.195 --> 09:07.754
we should be safe enough until our
stock issue.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.754
Where are we with that?
It's all in process.

09:10.755 --> 09:14.114
Crabb and I are in constant liaison
with the City and the Bank.

09:14.115 --> 09:17.596
They should be ready to recommend
issue in about two months' time.

09:17.597 --> 09:20.355
Give or take a week.
I'll take a week.

09:20.356 --> 09:22.474
I beg your pardon?
One week.

09:22.475 --> 09:24.876
They have everything they need.
Why wait?

09:24.877 --> 09:27.035
Steady, old man.

09:27.036 --> 09:30.314
I mean, the banks move...

09:30.315 --> 09:34.513
well, some might say slowly, but
that's the way our system works.

09:34.514 --> 09:37.275
Well, we're going to have to change
the system.

09:38.115 --> 09:40.236
Harry, if I have to say it I will.

09:40.237 --> 09:43.236
Your accident - they'll be spooked.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.034
Now's not the right time to push
them.

09:46.035 --> 09:47.996
Now is always the right time.

09:47.997 --> 09:52.154
Good God, man! Sir Oliver's only been
Chairman a few months.

09:52.155 --> 09:54.715
I've dealt with banks forever.

09:54.716 --> 09:56.674
And I can tell you this for tuppence.

09:56.675 --> 09:59.316
I've not seen them hurried along by
anyone yet.

09:59.317 --> 10:01.354
Especially by an American.

10:01.355 --> 10:03.835
Yet. How about this?

10:04.715 --> 10:08.756
Why don't we go to the bank and
persuade them to speed it up?

10:09.556 --> 10:13.516
Or we get Crabb to bring the bank to
us.

10:15.996 --> 10:18.355
To... To us, Mr Selfridge?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.835
And... And I will?

10:20.836 --> 10:23.195
You will. Good man, Crabb.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.915
Funny little snippet?
Uh-huh?

10:30.916 --> 10:34.475
You know that young artist, Roderick
Temple?

10:34.476 --> 10:36.515
Painted your portrait?

10:36.516 --> 10:38.516
What about him?

10:39.115 --> 10:42.955
Well, his exhibition is a huge
success in Paris.

10:42.956 --> 10:45.873
Which means that his prices will go
through the roof

10:45.874 --> 10:48.955
and your painting will be worth quite
a few dollars now.

10:52.476 --> 10:54.476
Well, I made the right choice, then.

10:59.996 --> 11:02.035
What's this?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.035
'Kitty'.

11:10.916 --> 11:12.916
Here you are, there's a card.

11:14.036 --> 11:16.635
'Dear Kitty, sweets for a
sweetheart.'

11:16.636 --> 11:18.674
It's a love gift.

11:18.675 --> 11:21.755
I always wanted a mystery admirer!

11:38.195 --> 11:40.195
Hello.

11:48.565 --> 11:51.365
Perhaps I should come here more
often.

11:58.205 --> 12:01.503
Agnes Towler, Sir.
And you're a member of staff?

12:01.528 --> 12:03.769
I did get permission to be here, sir.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.769
Of course you did!

12:06.129 --> 12:08.167
The Hound Of The Baskervilles.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.847
Not too frightening for you,
young lady?

12:10.848 --> 12:13.489
Frightened the life out of me, sir.
I loved it!

12:15.209 --> 12:18.848
Excuse us. Sir Arthur.
Ah, Mr Selfridge!

12:18.849 --> 12:22.208
I don't think I've ever signed so
many books.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.327
I may never have to write another.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.809
My wife would never forgive
me. This is Mrs Selfridge.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.809
Sir Arthur.
Enchanted.

12:31.049 --> 12:34.407
I'm a little tongue-tied.
I just adore your books.

12:34.408 --> 12:36.529
But I suppose you hear that all the
time.

12:36.530 --> 12:38.568
Oh, trust me, Mrs Selfridge,

12:38.569 --> 12:42.087
a writer never wearies of that one
particular phrase.

12:42.088 --> 12:45.847
Would you sign...? I was going to
pretend it's for the children.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.729
But, er... for Rose Selfridge.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.929
For Rosa Selfridge.

12:51.289 --> 12:54.569
Er, Rose.
Oh, Rose. I am so sorry.

12:56.169 --> 13:00.128
And this too, I assume, is to ROSE
Selfridge.

13:00.129 --> 13:02.888
Yes, indeed.

13:02.889 --> 13:04.969
Now, I am forgetting my manners.

13:04.970 --> 13:07.288
Mr Rex Crenell.

13:07.289 --> 13:09.288
Our esteemed guest...

13:09.289 --> 13:12.127
from the same side of the pond as
you, Mrs Selfridge.

13:12.128 --> 13:15.367
How do you do?
Mr Crenell is a Spirit Sensitive

13:15.368 --> 13:18.529
held in high regard by the
Spiritualist movement.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.529
Are you a medium?
Yes.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.809
So you're familiar with the movement.
It is very popular in America.

13:30.449 --> 13:34.088
Afternoon, Miss Hawkins, Miss Miller.
Hello, George.

13:34.089 --> 13:36.247
What a day, rushed of our feet,
we are.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.849
Nothing like on the shop floor,
I can tell you.

13:39.729 --> 13:42.609
Right, come on, Doris. We've only
got half and hour.

13:45.889 --> 13:47.889
What do you want?

13:48.729 --> 13:50.688
Tea, please.

13:50.689 --> 13:52.689
And a sandwich.
Of course.

13:53.609 --> 13:55.648
The same, please.
Certainly.

13:55.649 --> 13:57.649
Look who's over there.

14:00.009 --> 14:03.968
Isn't that old Bunting that got
sacked from fashion? Yes.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.089
Cor, she don't half look rough.

14:07.609 --> 14:10.089
Where are you going?
To talk to her.

14:13.649 --> 14:16.648
Hello, Miss Bunting.
Miss Millar, isn't it?

14:16.649 --> 14:18.688
That's right.

14:18.689 --> 14:20.849
Can I sit down?
Of course.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.329
How have you been?

14:27.249 --> 14:30.369
Well, it's not been easy, not
without a reference.

14:31.729 --> 14:35.489
I just had an interview at
Liberty's. A friend got it for me.

14:36.849 --> 14:40.089
They're not taking me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:42.169 --> 14:45.329
I hear Mr Selfridge has recovered
from his accident. Yes.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.929
I'm so glad. He's a good man.

14:50.249 --> 14:52.607
I shouldn't have done what I did.
I was...

14:52.608 --> 14:56.009
Doris... There's some seats over
here. Are you coming?

14:59.009 --> 15:02.729
Well... loads of luck to you,
Miss Bunting.

15:03.649 --> 15:05.649
I hope you see you in here again.

15:11.049 --> 15:13.048
Oh, is that yours?

15:13.049 --> 15:15.008
They do nice buns here.

15:15.009 --> 15:17.009
That should stand you a couple.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.889
Thank you.

15:25.729 --> 15:29.008
Why did you do that?
It was your money!

15:29.009 --> 15:31.048
Can't you see?

15:31.049 --> 15:32.969
She's hungry.

15:35.889 --> 15:38.447
It really was most peculiar,
Sir Arthur.

15:38.448 --> 15:42.847
Even though Harry was unconscious,
it was if he was in another world.

15:42.848 --> 15:47.049
There's a famous case of a Mrs
Haskins reported by the Boston Globe.

15:47.050 --> 15:51.569
Apparently her heart had stopped for
over 20 minutes.

15:52.489 --> 15:54.528
No breath. No sign of life.

15:54.529 --> 15:56.568
The nurse closed her eyes...

15:56.569 --> 15:59.729
and then suddenly they opened again.

16:01.249 --> 16:03.249
Mrs Haskins took a deep breath.

16:04.849 --> 16:07.849
And there she was, perfectly normal.

16:09.409 --> 16:14.449
Hm. So you think I could've been
partly dead yet partly alive too?

16:15.409 --> 16:17.288
Yes, it's possible.

16:17.289 --> 16:19.687
I mean we don't really know -
thank you -

16:19.688 --> 16:22.969
how fine the line is between this
world and the next.

16:22.970 --> 16:25.528
Forgive me, Sir Arthur, Mr Crenell,

16:25.529 --> 16:29.889
but you do hear of, well, vulnerable
people being exploited by mediums.

16:31.169 --> 16:34.367
I have come across a share of quacks
in my time.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.487
And I have also come across phenomena

16:36.488 --> 16:40.169
my own Sherlock Holmes would be hard
pressed to explain.

16:41.689 --> 16:45.288
I'd be happy to hold a seance in
this building.

16:45.289 --> 16:47.809
It's got the right feel.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.009
Really?

16:51.809 --> 16:54.089
Would that be agreeable,
Mr Selfridge?

16:55.169 --> 16:58.609
Uh... I don't think that our customers
would care for it.

16:58.610 --> 17:02.009
For the staff. It can be their
choice.

17:03.129 --> 17:05.608
It is Mr Crenell's last night with
us.

17:07.648 --> 17:13.809
It would be a sort of spiritualist
validation of the venue, in a way.

17:14.809 --> 17:16.809
Oh, Harry, please.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.529
Well I know when I've been
outnumbered!

17:21.449 --> 17:26.169
Well done, Sir Arthur. Usually it's
Harry that does all the persuading in
this store.

17:27.449 --> 17:31.447
Now Miss Towler, if you don't want
to move departments, I can put your
case.

17:31.448 --> 17:33.569
In fact, I shall be sorry to see you
go.

17:34.689 --> 17:37.489
You have an earnest work ethic which
indeed,

17:37.490 --> 17:39.488
from time to time, reminds...

17:39.489 --> 17:42.849
But enough about that.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.168
What do you say, Miss Towler?

17:46.169 --> 17:48.329
I think I'd like to move,
Miss Mardle.

17:48.330 --> 17:52.248
If you wouldn't be terribly offended.
I see.

17:52.249 --> 17:54.128
It's just, well...

17:54.129 --> 17:57.207
it's the department that I see myself
in, in the future.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.527
Not that I haven't loved every minute
here in Accessories.

18:00.528 --> 18:02.649
Very well. Good luck, Miss Towler.

18:03.489 --> 18:05.489
The best of British to you.

18:09.569 --> 18:13.207
Ladies. Miss Towler will be working
under Miss Ravillious from now on.

18:13.208 --> 18:17.367
If either of you wishes to be in the
running for the post of Senior
Accessories Assistant,

18:17.368 --> 18:21.569
I strongly recommend that you do not
suck sweets in the store whilst on
duty!

18:26.769 --> 18:29.248
Where are we with the bank, Crabb?

18:29.249 --> 18:32.569
I've just been there. It's...
It's delicate, Mr Selfridge.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.608
I'm doing my best.
Good.

18:34.609 --> 18:38.049
Oh, and Crabb, there's a seance in
the Palm Court this evening.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.049
Staff are welcome to attend.

18:45.129 --> 18:48.607
Ah. The seance. Looks like quite a
few of us are going.

18:48.608 --> 18:52.007
We could be opening up the store to
all sorts of spirits! Miss Mardle -

18:52.008 --> 18:54.087
Mrs Grove is scarcely cold in her
grave!

18:54.088 --> 18:58.609
My dear Miss Mardle, you hardly
think she'll come back and haunt
Mr...

19:00.689 --> 19:03.049
As far as we could tell from the
responses,

19:03.050 --> 19:05.208
he was a Jacobean gentleman

19:05.209 --> 19:08.929
and quite possible the secretary to
King James.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.769
Yes, do please take a seat.

19:14.929 --> 19:16.968
Thank you all for coming.

19:16.969 --> 19:20.808
And a very big thank you to Sir
Arthur and Mr Crenell

19:20.809 --> 19:23.169
for sharing this experience with us.

19:26.089 --> 19:30.288
We should never shy away from being
at the forefront

19:30.289 --> 19:34.048
of progress and discovery here at
Selfridge's.

19:34.049 --> 19:37.408
Open minds expand...

19:37.409 --> 19:41.408
to take in new experiences...
and new knowledge.

19:41.409 --> 19:44.129
Mr Crenell.
Thank you.

19:45.809 --> 19:49.207
There's nothing to be afraid of,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:49.208 --> 19:53.209
But if you feel the need of a nervous
laugh, well, that's fine too.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.848
Now, let me explain.

19:55.849 --> 20:00.569
We put out food and drink as a
reminder of the physical world.

20:01.649 --> 20:05.809
Candles signifying light and warmth.

20:07.289 --> 20:11.688
Planchette based on ancient Egyptian
rites,

20:11.689 --> 20:15.489
just another channel of communication
should the spirits choose.

20:16.369 --> 20:18.409
Sometimes they wish to commune...

20:18.410 --> 20:20.409
and sometimes they don't.

20:21.329 --> 20:25.209
We simply extend a friendly
invitation. It's no more than that.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.809
Sorry. That was me.

20:31.271 --> 20:36.091
Memento mori,
memento mori, memento mori...

20:43.627 --> 20:46.986
Yes! Yes, I can feel your presence!

20:47.074 --> 20:50.434
Please feel free to join us.
You are amongst friends.

20:52.674 --> 20:55.273
We've got somebody's twin.

20:55.274 --> 20:57.473
Bound to be someone's twin.

20:57.474 --> 21:02.434
I have an elderly gentlemen, lived
in the countryside. Somerset.

21:03.354 --> 21:05.793
Another. Auntie Flo.

21:05.794 --> 21:07.753
Have I got that right?

21:07.754 --> 21:10.914
Your Auntie Flo, Kitty!
Yes, but she's not dead, is she?

21:10.915 --> 21:12.754
Ssh.
I have a woman.

21:13.754 --> 21:15.594
You've not long passed over.

21:15.595 --> 21:17.753
You want to pass on a message.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.593
Your husband.

21:19.594 --> 21:22.434
Yes, yes, we can do that.

21:23.914 --> 21:27.154
Please, what is your name?

21:43.234 --> 21:45.273
H.
Hettie Grove.

21:45.274 --> 21:47.274
Your name begins with H.

21:48.194 --> 21:50.834
Yes. Yes, I've got that.

21:51.634 --> 21:53.392
Tell him you're out of pain

21:53.393 --> 21:56.034
and thank him for all the years he
cared for you.

21:56.035 --> 21:58.074
What's that?

21:58.834 --> 22:00.834
You want him to marry again.

22:01.314 --> 22:04.754
Marry with your blessing. Yes.

22:07.074 --> 22:09.354
Who... Who is this?

22:10.194 --> 22:12.594
Who is this trying to push?

22:13.914 --> 22:15.954
Who is this trying to push through?

22:15.955 --> 22:19.073
You use too much force, sir.

22:19.074 --> 22:21.153
Sir, you've not been invited.

22:21.154 --> 22:23.034
I must politely ask you to...

22:25.074 --> 22:26.874
I must ask you to...

22:28.714 --> 22:31.434
Kindly leave us, good sir.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.953
We do not pass hostile messages!

22:34.954 --> 22:36.993
I repeat!

22:36.994 --> 22:41.194
I must ask you to withdraw
and if you will not...

22:42.754 --> 22:47.033
..then we must. The seance is over!

22:47.034 --> 22:49.034
Break the circle!

23:00.394 --> 23:02.232
Thank you very much, Mr Selfridge.

23:02.233 --> 23:05.792
The Spiritualists will feel very much
at home in your fine establishment.

23:05.793 --> 23:08.112
Well done for the pluck.
Mrs Selfridge.

23:08.113 --> 23:12.672
Mr Selfridge, I felt a strong spirit
drawn to you. A malign male force,
I'm sorry to say.

23:12.673 --> 23:16.034
I'd be happy to offer a private
session if you'd like me to reason
with him.

23:16.035 --> 23:18.073
Thank you but no, Mr Crenell.

23:18.074 --> 23:23.594
That smacks of dwelling in the past
and that's not something I want to
do. Well done, though. Thank you.

23:25.674 --> 23:27.713
Thank you, Fraser.

23:27.714 --> 23:30.474
Thank you.
Thank you, Fraser.

23:34.514 --> 23:38.873
Rose, those nightmares Harry's been
having -

23:38.874 --> 23:41.912
has he told you what they're about?
Not really.

23:41.913 --> 23:45.434
I think they're a repeat of whatever
he saw when he was unconscious.

23:45.435 --> 23:47.313
Why do you ask?

23:47.314 --> 23:49.233
Oh, just wondering.

23:49.234 --> 23:51.394
He used to have nightmares when he
was a boy.

23:51.395 --> 23:53.433
Did he?
Mm-hm.

23:53.434 --> 23:55.434
Well, I suppose most young boys do.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.274
Come.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.794
Roger. The seance last night.

24:11.794 --> 24:13.832
The initial H, you mean?
Yes.

24:13.833 --> 24:16.792
All that malarkey about thanking me
for minding her?

24:16.793 --> 24:20.194
It's well known these people conduct
research into recent deaths.

24:20.195 --> 24:22.193
But what if it's true?

24:22.194 --> 24:25.274
She's telling you it's all right for
you to marry again.

24:28.234 --> 24:32.154
This is a whole new way of life for
me. I'm still coming to terms with
it.

24:32.155 --> 24:34.154
You'll have to bear with me.

24:36.994 --> 24:40.354
I gave you my childbearing years.

24:41.634 --> 24:43.834
You understand that, don't you,
Roger?

24:45.114 --> 24:47.114
You've been wonderful to me, Josie.

24:50.354 --> 24:53.554
I waited, year after year.

24:55.354 --> 24:58.232
Week after week. Not knowing if this
is the night...

24:58.233 --> 25:00.794
he's going to turn up or not.
I know, my dear.

25:00.795 --> 25:02.794
I know.

25:04.234 --> 25:06.234
And now I'm still waiting, Roger.

25:12.914 --> 25:15.432
The new mannequins have arrived in
the studio.

25:15.433 --> 25:18.834
I'm going to take a chance and let
you dress them, Miss Towler.

25:19.314 --> 25:23.114
I'll do my best, Miss Ravillious.
I wouldn't expect any less of you.

25:24.434 --> 25:26.914
Are you happy to be here? In
fashion?

25:26.915 --> 25:29.393
Very happy, Miss Ravillious.
Good.

25:29.394 --> 25:32.194
But I did enjoy working for Miss
Mardle too.

25:32.195 --> 25:35.834
Of course you did. But we move on.
That's life.

25:42.954 --> 25:44.994
Mr Leclair...

25:45.594 --> 25:49.553
Sorry, I just wanted to share my
news.

25:49.554 --> 25:52.953
I've heard...
and I'm very glad for you.

25:52.954 --> 25:55.274
I am sure you'll excel in this
department.

25:56.674 --> 25:58.713
Thank you.

25:58.714 --> 26:00.714
Good luck.

26:03.674 --> 26:08.113
He's certainly back at full speed.
Actually, I can understand

26:08.114 --> 26:10.234
why Harry wants to push things along.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.113
It's just his approach that worries
me.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.154
Not to mention your investment.

26:15.155 --> 26:16.994
Indeed.

26:19.154 --> 26:22.994
I think I might require your unique
set of skills with this.

26:31.794 --> 26:33.994
Miss Millar! Doris...

26:34.994 --> 26:37.112
Just thought I'd pop in for a cuppa.

26:37.113 --> 26:40.154
Like when you were on your tea break
from Selfridge's.

26:40.155 --> 26:43.994
Yes, I suppose I was pretending a
little bit.

26:45.434 --> 26:47.472
But this will be an end to it.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.474
That was my last farthing anyway.

26:50.354 --> 26:54.354
I don't seem to have any hope of
getting another job without a
reference.

26:59.434 --> 27:01.433
I'm not a thief, Doris.

27:01.434 --> 27:03.953
Oh... I'm sure you're not.

27:03.954 --> 27:05.713
I know there's no excuse

27:05.714 --> 27:08.834
but the medicine for my mother was
so expensive.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.194
And how is she, Miss Bunting?

27:14.954 --> 27:16.994
She...

27:19.874 --> 27:21.874
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:25.714 --> 27:28.952
If you'll wait for me, we could have
supper here together.

27:28.953 --> 27:33.394
I was... I was thinking of doing that
anyway. Some company would be nice.

27:35.234 --> 27:37.234
My treat.

27:38.194 --> 27:40.233
Thank you.

27:40.234 --> 27:42.714
I'd like that very much, Doris.

27:56.218 --> 27:58.657
What is it?
Telegram, Lady Loxley.

27:58.895 --> 28:00.895
Slide it under the door.

28:05.695 --> 28:07.813
Something the matter with your legs?

28:07.814 --> 28:10.135
You've turned them to jelly,
dear heart.

28:23.615 --> 28:26.695
Oh. I'll be seeing you in the store
again later.

28:28.055 --> 28:31.135
Looks like it's going to be quite a
day for Mr Selfridge.

28:36.855 --> 28:38.614
Mr Selfridge.

28:38.615 --> 28:41.735
The Chairman of the bank, Sir Oliver
Standish himself,

28:41.736 --> 28:44.414
and his Deputy, Mr Lionel Fitch,

28:44.415 --> 28:48.775
will meet you on the shop floor
at precisely four o'clock today.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.695
Thank you, Crabb. Well done.

28:53.375 --> 28:57.095
But I'm still worried about your
erm... Our approach to them.

28:57.096 --> 29:00.295
Worry duly noted. Thank you, Crabb.

29:29.175 --> 29:31.214
It's a note.

29:31.215 --> 29:35.535
Asking to see me at the tea hut on
Duke Street later on.

29:36.935 --> 29:38.935
Mr Edwards?
Could be.

29:40.255 --> 29:42.255
And look, it's in pencil.

29:43.775 --> 29:45.813
Maybe even the one I sold him!

29:45.814 --> 29:48.975
And it makes sense he wouldn't want
to meet in the store.

29:48.976 --> 29:52.255
Mrs Kitty... Edwards.

29:53.495 --> 29:56.333
Who'd have thought?
Let's not get too carried away.

29:56.334 --> 29:58.655
I'll be lost without you here, Kitty.

29:59.455 --> 30:02.535
Even if it means I'll get promoted to
Senior Assistant.

30:05.415 --> 30:09.255
Promise we'll always be friends?
Well, I'm far from being gone yet.

30:10.695 --> 30:14.215
But whatever happens, of course
we'll always be best friends.

30:14.216 --> 30:16.255
Good!
Great!

30:25.575 --> 30:28.334
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.

30:28.335 --> 30:30.335
Excuse moi.

30:36.575 --> 30:38.615
Agnes, come here.

30:42.855 --> 30:44.895
Come...

31:09.575 --> 31:11.615
Come.

31:14.975 --> 31:17.014
Mr Grove, sir?

31:17.015 --> 31:19.015
Miss Millar?

31:26.975 --> 31:29.935
I know it's not my place to bother
you, Mr Grove.

31:29.936 --> 31:31.975
Do you have a grievance?

31:33.255 --> 31:36.173
It's Miss Bunting.
I met her in the tea room.

31:36.174 --> 31:39.055
Her mother's passed and she hasn't a
brass farthing.

31:39.855 --> 31:42.175
I'm very sorry to hear that but I
don't see...

31:42.176 --> 31:43.974
If you could...

31:43.975 --> 31:47.535
If you could just see fit to give her
a reference.

31:50.855 --> 31:53.893
It's very difficult, Miss Millar,
under the circumstances.

31:53.894 --> 31:56.335
Oh, please, Mr Grove! Give her hope.

31:57.775 --> 32:01.535
She's in a bad way. I can't help but
think if she were my own mother...

32:02.175 --> 32:04.175
It would be so kind of you.

32:15.055 --> 32:17.094
Give her this.

32:17.095 --> 32:19.695
Tell her come back at the same time
next week.

32:20.935 --> 32:24.615
I shall broach the subject with Mr
Selfridge. Thank you, Mr Grove!

32:25.895 --> 32:27.895
Honest, it'll mean the world to her.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.615
You've a soft heart, Doris.

32:39.815 --> 32:41.815
'Doris'!

32:43.015 --> 32:45.015
Miss Millar.

32:50.815 --> 32:54.335
The Chairman of the bank and his
deputy are here, Mr Selfridge.

32:55.455 --> 32:58.335
Well done, Crabb. Well done.

32:58.975 --> 33:00.933
We're not trying to reinvent the
wheel.

33:00.934 --> 33:03.293
We're just trying to get it to turn
a bit faster.

33:03.294 --> 33:06.413
If I might, I wouldn't recommend
being too forceful, Mr Selfridge.

33:06.414 --> 33:08.615
The banks don't like being told what
to do.

33:08.616 --> 33:11.254
Ah. Welcome... Sir Oliver.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.814
Mr Selfridge.
Mr Fitch. Mr Musker.

33:14.815 --> 33:17.175
I am delighted with your visit.

33:18.295 --> 33:21.095
If only the other banks were half so
progressive.

33:21.096 --> 33:23.895
Coming out to see us like this, I...

33:25.095 --> 33:27.134
Well, I am impressed.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.774
Come on, let's take a walk.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.213
Have you ever been inside our store
before?

33:32.214 --> 33:35.295
We tend to leave shopping to our
wives, Mr Selfridge.

33:35.296 --> 33:39.254
We had a footfall of one million on
our opening week.

33:39.255 --> 33:42.373
We had people counting customers
inside and out.

33:42.374 --> 33:44.693
That is forward thinking, don't you
think?

33:44.694 --> 33:48.855
We too like forward thinking, Mr
Selfridge, but at a steady pace.

33:48.856 --> 33:53.615
You do seem to relish speed in all
things, including motor cars?

33:54.575 --> 33:59.294
Well... Luckily, our wise backer,
Mr Musker,

33:59.295 --> 34:04.294
has complete confidence in our
business and our speed.

34:04.295 --> 34:07.695
And I take it you have complete
confidence in him as well?

34:08.895 --> 34:11.813
There's the question of recent press,
Mr Selfridge.

34:11.813 --> 34:15.373
Rather a lot of it. Not all
favourable, it has to be said.

34:15.373 --> 34:19.094
Investors might be wary now. You
Americans have a reputation

34:19.096 --> 34:20.813
for being reckless and -

34:20.815 --> 34:23.895
Let's just hit the nail on the head,
shall we, gentlemen?

34:24.775 --> 34:27.335
You can't have a problem with our
business proposals

34:27.655 --> 34:30.695
because they make sense.
Your problem is me.

34:32.935 --> 34:34.975
We do have concerns, yes.

34:35.935 --> 34:38.135
The thing is, gentlemen, I nearly
died.

34:38.935 --> 34:41.215
And I understand that concerns you.

34:41.216 --> 34:44.054
The business carries my name,
after all.

34:44.054 --> 34:47.415
But this store will go on long after
we're all gone.

34:47.416 --> 34:51.454
And that's what matters.
It is strong, it is dependable.

34:51.455 --> 34:54.013
Sure, more reliable than me
sometimes!

34:54.014 --> 34:56.534
It's about what we leave behind,
gentlemen.

34:57.655 --> 35:01.695
And sometimes what we leave behind is
more important than ourselves.

35:02.735 --> 35:04.735
It's about legacy.

35:07.335 --> 35:09.335
Lady Loxley.

35:10.135 --> 35:13.535
Always such a pleasure.
Sir Oliver. It's been too long.

35:14.815 --> 35:17.935
What fusty old business are we up to
anyway, gentlemen?

35:17.936 --> 35:21.974
Oh, just bringing Mr Selfridge to
the markets, that's all.

35:21.975 --> 35:24.654
Very boring for some.
On the contrary.

35:24.655 --> 35:27.775
I take it you're advocating the
traditional stance

35:27.776 --> 35:29.774
of caution and decorum.

35:29.775 --> 35:31.894
And Mr Selfridge is being...

35:31.895 --> 35:34.535
Well... Mr Selfridge?

35:36.615 --> 35:38.654
Isn't he refreshing?

35:38.655 --> 35:40.695
Indeed.

35:41.535 --> 35:44.853
And I do hope you're extending him
the courtesy of listening.

35:44.854 --> 35:46.695
That is the British way, after all.

35:46.696 --> 35:51.535
Of course. But there are issues of
credibility to consider.

35:52.655 --> 35:55.895
Ah, the seance! Yes, I heard.

35:56.615 --> 36:00.615
Such a wise business move to keep the
wonderfully popular Sir Arthur happy.

36:00.616 --> 36:05.214
Didn't he write, 'It is a capital
mistake to theorise

36:05.215 --> 36:08.615
before you have all the evidence -
it biases the judgment'?

36:10.135 --> 36:12.175
Good day to you, gentlemen.

36:29.615 --> 36:32.255
Fancy a cuppa, Miss Kitty?

36:33.535 --> 36:36.615
No, thank you, George Towler.
I'm waiting for someone.

36:46.255 --> 36:49.534
You!
I don't know what came over me.

36:49.535 --> 36:52.294
It's just you're always so pretty.

36:52.295 --> 36:54.895
IT makes my day when I catch a look
at you.

36:54.896 --> 36:57.614
Don't be angry with me. Please
don't.

36:57.615 --> 37:00.975
Maybe I am angry.
Maybe I'm very angry indeed!

37:05.695 --> 37:07.733
You could at least have signed the
note.

37:07.734 --> 37:10.253
What if I'd gone off thinking it was
someone else?

37:10.254 --> 37:12.495
I could have made a right fool of
myself.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.534
I'm really sorry, Miss Kitty.

37:14.535 --> 37:16.294
I just thought...

37:16.295 --> 37:19.215
Everyone can have a nice dream for a
day, can't they?

37:19.216 --> 37:21.255
I didn't mean no harm.

37:22.415 --> 37:24.455
I know it was a terrible cheek.

37:24.456 --> 37:26.494
The likes of me and all.

37:26.495 --> 37:30.895
But a cat can look at the Queen...
can't he?

37:34.415 --> 37:38.255
Well, this particular queen is awful
partial to cats, George Towler.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.895
And lucky for you...

37:41.855 --> 37:43.895
..humbugs.

37:47.815 --> 37:49.854
Excuse me, Mr Selfridge.

37:49.855 --> 37:55.335
The bank have invited you to meet
them at nine o'clock on Monday
morning to discuss the stock offer.

37:56.615 --> 37:59.095
Well done, Harry.
Well done, Mr Crabb.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.415
You got them in here.

38:08.215 --> 38:10.615
And I believe I owe you a thank you
too, John.

38:11.815 --> 38:13.693
Nothing to thank me for, old boy.

38:13.694 --> 38:16.135
Oh, I think you know what I'm
talking about.

38:16.136 --> 38:18.135
Lady Mae?

38:30.815 --> 38:32.815
Good night, Miss Towler.

38:37.335 --> 38:40.975
Mr Leclair... I was having trouble
with the erm...

38:41.935 --> 38:43.894
I wonder if you'd...

38:43.895 --> 38:46.055
Help you out. Yes, of course.

38:48.855 --> 38:50.894
Let me see that.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.975
It's nice but...

38:54.295 --> 38:56.335
It's the wrong colour, I think.

38:56.336 --> 38:58.335
What else have we got?

39:07.455 --> 39:09.455
What do you think?

39:11.375 --> 39:13.415
It's lovely.

39:25.895 --> 39:28.895
Agnes?
I wasn't sure how to do that.

39:30.335 --> 39:33.895
Did I... Did I do it all wrong,
then? The approach?

39:34.975 --> 39:37.695
I-I think you did... just right.

39:40.455 --> 39:42.695
But just to be sure,
maybe we should...

39:51.375 --> 39:53.935
I don't know if I can do this
without you and Pa!

39:53.936 --> 39:56.095
I'm scared, Mama.

39:59.535 --> 40:02.455
How can you not see how beautiful you
look?

40:04.335 --> 40:07.174
Now, you listen to me Rosalie
Selfridge.

40:07.175 --> 40:09.773
There's nothing wrong with being
scared.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.813
Pa's never been scared of anything!

40:11.814 --> 40:15.413
You honestly think he never had
moment when he was a boy,

40:15.414 --> 40:19.173
when it was just him and Grandma?
Isn't that right Lois? Mm-hm.

40:19.174 --> 40:22.895
Lucky for you, my girl, you'll never
know what it's like to be poor.

40:22.896 --> 40:25.375
And to lose your father in a war.

40:26.175 --> 40:28.535
To always live under that shadow.

40:35.495 --> 40:37.534
Ma...

40:37.535 --> 40:39.574
What's the matter?

40:39.575 --> 40:44.614
I made a very bad decision concerning
you when you were a young boy.

40:44.615 --> 40:46.534
Nonsense!

40:46.535 --> 40:48.535
You did everything right for me.

40:49.535 --> 40:52.615
What's the matter? I just know that
seance upset you.

40:53.855 --> 40:56.215
If anything, the seance taught me
that...

40:56.216 --> 41:00.334
the past haunts us if we don't
confront it.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.815
It finds a way.
Ma...

41:04.375 --> 41:07.055
It's just history, that's all the
past is.

41:07.935 --> 41:10.014
I have to tell you...

41:10.015 --> 41:12.615
your father did not die in the war.

41:13.695 --> 41:16.695
He was not a hero.
I know the truth, Ma.

41:20.015 --> 41:22.053
He left us to starve for all he
cared.

41:22.054 --> 41:24.415
He set up house with another woman.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.414
Don't you think that I know?

41:26.415 --> 41:29.055
Don't you think that I've always
known?

41:31.055 --> 41:33.615
I heard that he was alive.
I went to go see him.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.535
I don't want to end up like him.

41:39.135 --> 41:43.535
I made you live a lie.
No. You needed to believe in a hero.

41:43.895 --> 41:46.054
I suppose I was ashamed.

41:46.055 --> 41:50.214
I mean, there were widows everywhere
after the war

41:50.215 --> 41:54.015
and your father chose to walk out on
me and his young son.

41:54.016 --> 41:59.335
I didn't want you to feel the pain
inside like I did.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.974
I am so sorry.

42:01.975 --> 42:05.255
Everything good I've ever done in my
life is because of you.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.534
Now let's forget about him.

42:07.535 --> 42:09.535
It's ancient history now.

42:10.775 --> 42:13.095
I hope you're right, son.

42:15.975 --> 42:18.455
Lady Loxley is here, Mr Selfridge.

42:46.015 --> 42:49.574
Harry. I've brought a little
something for Rosalie.

42:49.575 --> 42:52.333
Thank you for your kind words with
the bank today.

42:52.334 --> 42:54.653
Pretty convenient you happened to be
there

42:54.654 --> 42:57.133
at the exact moment that we needed
you.

42:57.134 --> 42:59.895
I don't suppose that you had a word
with Mr Musker?

42:59.896 --> 43:03.094
He might've sent me a little note.

43:03.095 --> 43:05.134
Well done, Harry.

43:05.135 --> 43:08.055
The favours I owe you are piling up.

43:08.975 --> 43:11.494
Oh, I keep tally, don't you worry.

43:11.495 --> 43:14.255
Do keep one thing in mind, won't you?

43:15.295 --> 43:17.573
Issue of stock is excellent for
business.

43:17.574 --> 43:19.935
Maybe not quite so excellent for the
family.

43:19.936 --> 43:22.254
Why should it affect my family?

43:22.255 --> 43:24.615
Going public - it means exactly that.

43:24.616 --> 43:26.654
Just so you're forewarned.

43:26.655 --> 43:29.014
You court publicity, Harry.

43:29.015 --> 43:32.335
But now your family will do too,
whether they like it or not.

43:37.655 --> 43:39.695
Oh...

43:40.135 --> 43:41.894
Rosalie.
Beautiful!

43:41.895 --> 43:44.255
I'm speechless.
I doubt that, Pa.

43:45.815 --> 43:49.375
They are gonna fall at your feet.
I hope not. My feet are too big.

43:49.376 --> 43:51.014
Rosalie...

43:51.015 --> 43:53.055
My dear.

43:55.575 --> 43:57.415
Thank you, Lady Mae.

44:02.375 --> 44:06.013
I'm a bit nervous, to tell the truth.
There's no need to be.

44:06.014 --> 44:08.253
The young ladies will be jealous of
you.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.493
And the young men are going to adore
you.

44:10.494 --> 44:12.733
And if the young man get fresh with
you...

44:12.734 --> 44:15.133
You know, Rose, we should go with
her.

44:15.134 --> 44:17.535
Harry, I'm going to take very good
care of her.

44:17.536 --> 44:19.454
That's what I'm afraid of.

44:19.455 --> 44:21.975
Can you handle all this attention,
Rosalie?

44:22.975 --> 44:27.895
I'm the luckiest girl in the whole
world to have you for my Pa.

44:28.815 --> 44:32.415
Now stop worrying. Go annoy Ma or
something.

44:35.695 --> 44:37.695
You're so beautiful.

44:38.975 --> 44:41.294
- Good night.
- Good night.

44:41.295 --> 44:43.335
She's in your hands, Lady Mae.

44:49.535 --> 44:54.254
I am not asking you. I am telling
you. You need an early night.

44:54.255 --> 44:57.174
You have to get some sleep.

44:57.175 --> 45:00.255
Sleep? Are you crazy?
How can I sleep?

45:00.855 --> 45:04.695
Harry... How can I possibly sleep
until I know that she's home safe?

45:05.215 --> 45:09.415
If I'm crazy it's because you drive
me crazy. Harry!

45:11.055 --> 45:13.773
Mr Woolworth is an American
gentleman, I believe?

45:13.774 --> 45:16.013
The West End's big enough to hold us
both.

45:16.014 --> 45:19.053
London can accept one American king
of commerce, but two?

45:19.054 --> 45:22.575
The decision as to who will become
senior assistant will be made this
week.

45:22.576 --> 45:24.574
We've got trouble.

45:24.575 --> 45:27.133
Perhaps we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

45:27.134 --> 45:30.695
You have a very lovely daughter.
Where have you been hiding her?
