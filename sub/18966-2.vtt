Kyle parks,
you're under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

00:04.203 --> 00:05.811
Reporter:  <i>Mr. Parks</i>
<i>was arrested last night</i>

00:05.911 --> 00:07.740
<i>And is being held</i>
<i>at harris county jail.</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:08.969
All right.
I'm hiring an attorney.

00:09.069 --> 00:10.685
You are not bailing
that man out of trouble.

00:10.785 --> 00:12.230
All we need
is a $5,000 retainer.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.742
I don't have
that kind of cash on me.

00:13.842 --> 00:14.763
How can I help you today?

00:14.863 --> 00:17.309
I need to open a small line
of credit on my house

00:17.409 --> 00:18.820
For some attorney fees.

00:18.920 --> 00:19.923

Manny monroe.
Manny the man!

00:24.944 --> 00:26.471
Manny the man might be
your friend, but I'm not.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.706
Did mr. Parks
ever give you
any of his funds off the sale

00:28.806 --> 00:30.711
Of the stolen
copper wire?
No.

00:30.811 --> 00:32.281
No one has given me
any money.

00:32.381 --> 00:33.850
Why are you standing
by him?

00:33.950 --> 00:35.897
He is katie
and travis' daddy.

00:35.997 --> 00:38.783
Are you sure
you're doing this for the kids
and not you?

00:38.883 --> 00:40.009
I promise.

00:40.156 --> 00:41.194
I've been there
for her.

00:41.294 --> 00:42.737
And there was nothing
in it for you, right?

00:42.837 --> 00:44.613
Don't you think we deserve
a little selfish time?

00:44.713 --> 00:45.913
Riley,
what are you getting at?

00:46.013 --> 00:47.308
I think you should
sell the rub.

00:47.408 --> 00:48.876
I'll make payments.
I'd be the owner.

00:48.976 --> 00:49.649
Think about it.
(glasses clink)

00:49.749 --> 00:51.891
I'm selling you

Okay.

00:51.991 --> 00:53.362
Jolene and kendra
just quit.

00:53.462 --> 00:55.166
Yeah, and dee ann
hurt her knee at zumba.

00:55.266 --> 00:57.995
I called in a favor from one
of my very powerful clients.

00:58.095 --> 00:59.325
Hello, judge overton.

00:59.425 --> 01:01.590
After that nasty business
with the councilman,

01:01.690 --> 01:07.010
I'm not sure how much longer
I can keep them
away from her.

01:08.451 --> 01:10.021
(moaning)

01:12.552 --> 01:13.392
Oh, yeah.

01:13.718 --> 01:14.922
Does that feel good
to you?

01:15.022 --> 01:17.332
Mmm, yeah.
It's great!

Oh, sure.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.081
Oh. No, it's...

04:08.056 --> 04:11.219

04:16.524 --> 04:17.798
And she wants to be

04:31.541 --> 04:34.278

04:34.378 --> 04:37.161

04:37.261 --> 04:39.714
Uh, let me think...
Making this costume,
casserole,

04:39.814 --> 04:41.249
And there's
a  <i>hoarders</i> rerun.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.969
As amazing
as that sounds,

04:43.069 --> 04:46.173
I wanted to take you
to someplace special.

04:46.273 --> 04:47.989
Oh. I don't know.

04:48.134 --> 04:49.731
I mean,
it is a 300-pound woman

04:49.831 --> 04:51.526

is overrun with bunnies.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.661

04:54.267 --> 04:56.662
I can do better
than bunnies.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.772
- Pick you up at 4:00?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:04.309 --> 05:05.573
Bye.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.852
Thank you. Thank you.

05:07.952 --> 05:08.676
Ow!

05:17.294 --> 05:18.774

the ambiance is to die for,

05:23.126 --> 05:24.222

hot spot.

05:29.297 --> 05:31.118
The manager?
Are you serious?

05:31.218 --> 05:32.562
Harold needed a hand
in running it,

05:32.662 --> 05:33.954
And if there is
one thing I learned

05:34.054 --> 05:37.560
In all my years at the rub
of sugar land, it's...

05:37.660 --> 05:39.445
How to give a man
a hand.
Mmm-hmm.

05:39.545 --> 05:40.525
(both laugh)

05:40.625 --> 05:42.104
Okay. Don't tell me.

05:43.461 --> 05:46.014
My georgia
can't stop

05:46.114 --> 05:47.438
I'm harold.
It's a pleasure.

05:47.538 --> 05:48.308
Likewise.

05:48.521 --> 05:50.919
And thank you
for freeing up
my baby's time

05:51.019 --> 05:52.582
And handling everything
at the spa.

05:52.682 --> 05:55.823
Oh, well...
I'm an expert handler.

05:56.226 --> 05:57.992
Well,
welcome to my place.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.647
I'm sure we'll see
each other soon.
Mwah!

06:00.747 --> 06:02.497
Ladies, excuse me.

06:02.597 --> 06:05.617
Ooh.
He is handsome.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.119
Isn't he, though?

06:07.219 --> 06:09.179
And as sweet as sugar.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.473
That's why he can never
find out about the spa.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.474
Woman,
it's in the vault.

06:16.537 --> 06:18.446
Oh, honey!

06:19.220 --> 06:20.783
I can't take cash.

06:20.883 --> 06:23.632
But you said
that I could make payments.

06:23.732 --> 06:25.799
You're not changing your mind
about selling the rub.

06:25.899 --> 06:28.459
No, no, honey.
I'm getting
out of the game,

06:28.559 --> 06:30.918
But you can't pay me
with this.

06:31.018 --> 06:33.711
This deal has got to be
completely aboveboard

06:33.811 --> 06:34.963
For me and for you.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.165
Okay.
I'll get you a check.

06:37.265 --> 06:38.258
Harold:
Sweetie.

06:38.358 --> 06:39.565
There's a girl here
to see you

06:39.665 --> 06:40.885
About that
waitress position.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.135
Okay. Tell her
I'll be right there.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.674
Look, georgia,
I'm getting ready to hire
some new girls myself,

06:46.774 --> 06:49.145
So how do I know
who to trust?

06:49.245 --> 06:51.939
Take your time.
Follow your gut.

06:52.039 --> 06:54.558
There's a lot more
at stake at the rub

06:54.658 --> 06:56.260
Than just messing up
a drink order.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.839
One bad decision,

06:57.939 --> 07:02.489
And everything
we've worked for
goes down the drain.

07:06.046 --> 07:08.294
(buzzer blares)

07:09.690 --> 07:10.626
What's going on?

07:10.726 --> 07:12.607
The judge moved up
the bail hearing.

07:12.707 --> 07:14.320
I tried to call you,
but it was all over
in 10 minutes.

07:14.420 --> 07:15.441
Okay.
What happened?

07:15.541 --> 07:18.053
Well, we pled not guilty
to first-degree
felony larceny.

07:18.153 --> 07:19.259
So, they're gonna
release him on bail,

07:19.359 --> 07:20.889
You told the judge
that he's got family here?

07:20.989 --> 07:23.461
The da argued
that he's a flight risk

07:23.561 --> 07:24.680
And a danger
to the community.

07:24.780 --> 07:27.516
Well, that's just ridiculous.
I mean, what's the bail?

07:27.616 --> 07:28.716
$75,000.

07:29.109 --> 07:30.549
Is that judge on crack?
(buzzer blares)

07:30.649 --> 07:31.880
(door opens)

07:31.980 --> 07:33.473
(sighs)

07:33.914 --> 07:35.791
$75,000, kyle?

07:35.959 --> 07:36.758
The court is concerned

07:36.858 --> 07:38.855
That kyle might flee
back to mexico...

07:38.955 --> 07:41.758
Not to mention
his lack of cooperation.

07:41.858 --> 07:43.126
What do they want
from him?

07:43.226 --> 07:44.570
A confession,
for starters.

07:44.670 --> 07:47.470
Right now the d.A.'s case
is entirely circumstantial.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.446
They have no evidence
tying kyle to the crime,

07:49.546 --> 07:50.899
But if that stolen wire
were to turn up...

07:50.999 --> 07:52.516
And I told you
that I don't have it.

07:52.616 --> 07:55.483
Okay. So, what if they could
get their wire back
from whoever did steal it?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.251
If vandermeyer construction
were to recoup their losses,

07:57.351 --> 08:00.619
They'd most likely drop
the charges against kyle.

08:00.719 --> 08:01.864
And until that happens,

08:01.964 --> 08:03.251
You need to put up
10% of the bail,

08:03.351 --> 08:05.387
And a bondsman
will put up the rest.

08:05.487 --> 08:07.188
You're looking
at $7,500.

08:07.288 --> 08:08.980
I need to speak
to kyle alone.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.690
I'll be in touch.

08:12.287 --> 08:13.213
(buzzer blares)

08:13.313 --> 08:16.664
Where the hell
am I supposed to get
$7,500, kyle?

08:16.764 --> 08:17.900
Everything
is gonna be okay.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.887
"okay?"
there's nothing about
any of this that's okay.

08:20.987 --> 08:22.303
Now, you need to
return that wire.

08:22.403 --> 08:23.721
That can't happen.
Why not?

08:23.821 --> 08:26.291
Because I want nothing more
to do with mick vandermeyer.

08:26.391 --> 08:28.180
That guy is nothing
but trouble.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.877
Graham just said
if they get back
what they lost,

08:29.977 --> 08:31.492
They might drop
the charges.

08:31.592 --> 08:34.447
Man: I'm afraid
your time's up, mr. Parks.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.547
Mr. Parks.

08:38.145 --> 08:39.654
Wow.

08:39.754 --> 08:41.316
(buzzer blares)

08:42.951 --> 08:44.193
Hey.
I just got here.

08:44.294 --> 08:46.375
Your mom told me
the bail hearing happened.
How'd it go?

08:46.475 --> 08:47.529
Not good.

08:47.629 --> 08:48.430
What can I do?

08:48.530 --> 08:51.273
Do you happen to have
$7,500?

08:52.336 --> 08:53.806
Didn't think so.

08:58.940 --> 09:00.889
Riley: Okay.
First two verses.

09:00.989 --> 09:02.820
All:  <i>♪ the stars at night</i>

09:02.920 --> 09:05.246
<i>♪ are big and bright</i>
<i>(all clap rhythmically)</i>

09:05.346 --> 09:08.258
<i>♪ deep in the heart of texas</i>

09:08.358 --> 09:11.960
<i>♪ the prairie skies</i>
<i>are wide and high</i>

09:12.060 --> 09:12.755
(all clap rhythmically)

09:12.855 --> 09:14.989
<i>♪ deep in the heart of texas</i>

09:15.089 --> 09:15.684
(riley and karina laughs)

09:15.784 --> 09:17.825
Texas wildlife day,
here we come!

09:17.925 --> 09:18.973
You guys were so great.

09:19.073 --> 09:20.296
Now,
who wants ice cream?

09:20.396 --> 09:21.155
All: Me!

09:21.255 --> 09:22.692
Well, then,
go get ready!

09:22.792 --> 09:24.087
Child: Yay!

09:24.187 --> 09:25.800
Whoo. Okay.

09:26.009 --> 09:27.463
Here you go.
Oh, yes. Thank you.

09:27.563 --> 09:29.799
I'm really glad
you guys came over.

09:29.899 --> 09:31.686
It's sweet
that they're friends.

09:31.786 --> 09:34.575
So, how are the kids
holding up?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.598
I haven't told them yet.

09:36.698 --> 09:39.275
I just wanted everything
to be sorted out.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.581
I was hoping
that my line of credit

09:40.681 --> 09:43.436
Would pay
all of kyle's legal fees.

09:43.536 --> 09:45.074
Is there anything
that we can do?

09:45.174 --> 09:46.685
Do you have
any more options?

09:46.785 --> 09:48.680
I mean, I know
you have some cash.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.057
Not nearly enough.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.514
It's like
I'm underwater here.

09:51.614 --> 09:53.467
Well, let me check
into your finances again.

09:53.567 --> 09:54.890
We'll figure
something out.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.478
(cell phone ringing)

09:56.578 --> 09:57.710
Excuse me.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.974
(cell phone beeps)
hey, georgia.

10:00.074 --> 10:01.602
Riley, whatever you did
with the client list,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.759
Make sure
it's good and hidden.

10:03.859 --> 10:05.553
<i>There's no time</i>
<i>to explain.</i>

10:05.653 --> 10:07.241
<i>Trust me.</i>

10:07.341 --> 10:08.420
(cell phone beeps)

10:08.520 --> 10:10.044
(clears throat)

10:10.389 --> 10:11.179
Karina:
Everything okay?

10:11.279 --> 10:13.754
Uh, you know what, actually?
It's a...
It's a work emergency.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.128
I got it. I got it.

10:15.228 --> 10:16.738
Come on, kids!

10:17.044 --> 10:18.753
Let's go get
some ice cream!

10:18.853 --> 10:20.449
Travis: Yay! Ice cream!
Bye-bye.

10:20.549 --> 10:21.789
Bye! Go get it!

10:21.889 --> 10:23.437
Katie: Love you!
Love you!

10:23.537 --> 10:25.598
Bye!
Bye!

10:42.046 --> 10:44.812
(tires screech)
(sirens chirps)

10:44.912 --> 10:47.306
(tires squeal in distance)

10:50.367 --> 10:53.654
Oh. Thank you,
mr. Armadillo.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.737
(zipper zips)

11:04.184 --> 11:06.075
(doorbell ringing)

11:12.333 --> 11:14.760
Hey.
What are y'all doing here?

11:14.860 --> 11:16.181
What's up, riley?
Riley parks,

11:16.281 --> 11:18.827
We have a warrant
to search your house.

11:18.927 --> 11:20.498
Dunbar: Come on, guys.
Let's go to work.

11:20.598 --> 11:21.728
Monroe: Sorry about this,
riley.

11:21.828 --> 11:24.338
_

11:25.346 --> 11:26.676
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:26.795 --> 11:30.995
Dunbar: All right.
Why don't you start in there?

11:31.095 --> 11:31.894
+

11:32.192 --> 11:34.543
So, are you guys
still looking around

11:34.643 --> 11:36.853
For large spools
of copper wire?

11:36.953 --> 11:38.609
We're not looking
for wire.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.187
Well, you're not tearing
my house apart for nothing.

11:41.287 --> 11:43.286
We're looking for cash.

11:43.386 --> 11:44.296
What cash?

11:44.507 --> 11:46.445
The stolen wire
was fenced last night
in biloxi

11:46.545 --> 11:48.026
By kyle's accomplice.

11:48.126 --> 11:50.075
Wait, you caught someone
with the wire?

11:50.175 --> 11:51.827
Kyle's accomplice
is still at large.

11:51.927 --> 11:54.637
The biloxi police
arrested the men
he sold the wire to.

11:54.737 --> 11:56.250
They paid thousands
in cash.

11:56.350 --> 11:57.440
Yeah. You can keep
looking around.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.837
You're not gonna find
anything here.

11:59.937 --> 12:02.578
Aiding and abetting a felon
is a serious crime.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.414
Eighteen months in prison
is a long time

12:04.514 --> 12:06.053
To spend
away from your family.

12:06.153 --> 12:07.402
I'm gonna say it again.

12:07.502 --> 12:09.640
You are not gonna find
anything here.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.630
We'll see about that.

12:11.733 --> 12:13.198
Let's check the bedroom.

12:13.298 --> 12:16.092
Wow. Talk about
your bedside manner.

12:16.192 --> 12:17.466
Let's go.
Be thorough.

12:17.566 --> 12:19.399
We can't all be
as sweet as you, riley,

12:19.499 --> 12:21.471
But my partner
does have a point.

12:21.571 --> 12:22.851
Do you really want to
take the fall

12:22.951 --> 12:24.088
For a crime
kyle committed?

12:24.188 --> 12:25.535
Allegedly committed.

12:25.635 --> 12:27.443
Kyle was my man
at ut.

12:27.543 --> 12:32.000
I had his back on that
football field,
and he had mine.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.676
But he's changed.

12:34.374 --> 12:37.301
This whole little walkabout
with these pills in mexico...

12:37.401 --> 12:38.914
A lady like you
doesn't deserve that.

12:39.014 --> 12:40.724
He's still my husband.
That hasn't changed.

12:40.824 --> 12:44.385
He's an anvil, riley,
and he's pulling you down.

12:44.485 --> 12:49.175
Now, if you want
to cooperate,
tell us what you know.

12:50.826 --> 12:52.860
(police radio chatter)

12:54.229 --> 12:55.370
(buzzer blares)

12:55.470 --> 12:56.940
Line up in hold.

12:59.588 --> 13:01.569
(speaking in spanish)

13:07.505 --> 13:08.263
All right.

13:08.363 --> 13:10.743
Let's move.
(buzzer blares)

13:11.924 --> 13:13.950
Lacey: I cannot believe
the police
searched your house.

13:14.050 --> 13:16.142
I know. I've never felt
so violated.

13:16.242 --> 13:17.572
Neither has he.

13:17.992 --> 13:20.012
You are very clever.
(chuckles softly)

13:20.112 --> 13:22.296
I'm just glad
I got the kids out in time.

13:22.396 --> 13:24.474
So, when are you gonna
tell them?

13:24.574 --> 13:26.527
I don't know... Hopefully,
kyle will get out on bail,

13:26.627 --> 13:27.573
And I won't have to.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.532
You came up
with the bail?
That was fast.

13:29.632 --> 13:30.724
I'm working on it.

13:30.824 --> 13:34.326
Now, does this look
like an armadillo to you?

13:34.426 --> 13:35.492
Kind of.

13:35.592 --> 13:37.041
(groans)
I am so overworked.

13:37.141 --> 13:39.070
Do you know that I've got
18 clients tomorrow?

13:39.170 --> 13:40.700
Is that even
humanly possible?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.838
No, that's why I'm hiring
some new masseuses.

13:42.938 --> 13:44.046
Ow!

13:44.258 --> 13:45.779
Well, how do you
hire therapists

13:45.879 --> 13:48.682
That do, you know,
what you do?

13:48.782 --> 13:49.453
I don't.

13:49.553 --> 13:51.516
I'm getting some people
who do legit massages,

13:51.616 --> 13:53.380
And if they end up,
like me, needing the money,

13:53.480 --> 13:55.766
Well, that is completely
up to them.

13:55.866 --> 13:57.977
So, you have no idea
what goes on behind
closed doors?

13:58.077 --> 14:00.264
Well, I definitely
have an idea.

14:00.364 --> 14:02.231
Like, I'm doing
a room-rental system...

14:02.331 --> 14:04.248
You know,
the more rooms I rent,
the more money I make.

14:04.348 --> 14:06.042
Kind of like we rent
the chairs at the salon,

14:06.142 --> 14:07.670
Except we just do
blow-dries.

14:07.770 --> 14:10.150
Lacey,
that is only selena.

14:10.942 --> 14:12.627
Well, how are you
gonna choose between
all these applicants?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.102
I don't know, but I'm glad
there are so many,

14:14.202 --> 14:17.205
'cause if I've learned
one thing about men,

14:17.305 --> 14:20.035
It's that they like
all types.

14:26.611 --> 14:29.524
Hello. Do you have
your massage license?

14:29.624 --> 14:30.736
Wow, you look, uh...

14:30.836 --> 14:33.405
You look different
from your picture. Hmm.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.989
Hi, there.
No, we don't do that here.

14:36.089 --> 14:37.533
No.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.826
You have
a massage license?

14:39.926 --> 14:41.997
Yeah, and I don't know
if it applies,

14:42.097 --> 14:43.672
But I'm also
a yoga instructor.

14:43.772 --> 14:44.914
Oh, that's cool.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.952
Believe me,
I could use
a shot of zen.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.444
Hmm.

14:48.544 --> 14:49.846
Hey, there.
(chuckles)

14:49.946 --> 14:51.048
Hold on.
Let me find you.

14:51.148 --> 14:54.483
Uh... Oh! Look there.
(chuckles)

14:55.284 --> 14:57.065
What was that?

14:58.396 --> 15:00.636
Hi. I'm nikki.
(chuckles)

15:00.768 --> 15:03.893
This place rocks.
Nice to meet you.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.277
You're so pretty.

15:05.377 --> 15:06.657
Well, thank you.
Nice to meet you, too.

15:06.757 --> 15:08.698
Have a seat.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.718
So, it says here
that you're a student.

15:10.818 --> 15:13.044
Oh, it's just
houston
community college.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.771
Nobody in my family
ever went to school,

15:14.871 --> 15:15.952
So it's kind of
a big deal.

15:16.052 --> 15:19.150
If my mom had her way,
I'd be a dallas
cowboy cheerleader.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.395
(laughs)
so, what are
you studying at school?

15:21.495 --> 15:23.338
Accounting.
I've got a thing
for numbers.

15:23.438 --> 15:25.679
Well, that could
come in handy
around here.

15:25.779 --> 15:27.058
So, you're not working
right now?

15:27.158 --> 15:30.973
No. I mean, I had a job,
but... It didn't work out.

15:31.073 --> 15:33.943
Well, what kind
of job was that?

15:34.518 --> 15:36.213
Okay. Well, look.
(chuckles)

15:36.313 --> 15:39.424
I'm not proud of this,
but I was dancing...

15:39.524 --> 15:41.389
And not
for the cowboys...

15:41.489 --> 15:43.878
I mean, not for
the dallas cowboys.

15:43.978 --> 15:44.435
(chuckles)

15:44.535 --> 15:46.400
Well,
tuition's expensive.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.460
Nothing to be ashamed of.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.976
Education's
very important.

15:49.076 --> 15:51.036
It's everything to me.

15:51.149 --> 15:53.421
Anyways, so I got
my massage license

15:53.521 --> 15:55.300
So that I wouldn't have to
take off my clothes at lunch

15:55.400 --> 15:58.943
For these horny guys
that give crappy tips.

15:59.043 --> 16:01.545
I shouldn't have brought up
that stripping thing.

16:01.645 --> 16:05.809
Look, I just want
you to know
I really want this job.

16:05.909 --> 16:07.324
Okay. Well,
if you really want it,

16:07.424 --> 16:11.185
There's just one more thing
you're gonna have to do.

16:11.285 --> 16:12.128
(moaning)

16:12.618 --> 16:15.093
This is really tight.
What have you been doing?

16:15.193 --> 16:16.946
Taking care of everybody
but me.

16:17.046 --> 16:18.134
(chuckles)

16:18.672 --> 16:20.540
I'm sure it's a lot of work
running this place,

16:20.640 --> 16:23.050
But you seem like
you'd be a cool boss.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.473
Oh, thank you.

16:24.632 --> 16:27.642
That is really...
Ooh, really nice.

16:27.815 --> 16:30.880
Hey, could you come back
and do this again tomorrow?

16:30.980 --> 16:32.315
You want me to
come back?

16:32.415 --> 16:34.717
Room 7 is all yours.

16:34.817 --> 16:35.990
(chuckles)
thank you.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.647
(cell phone ringing)
(sighs)

16:37.747 --> 16:38.881
(cell phone beeps)
hey, mama.

16:38.981 --> 16:40.063
Linette:
<i>We have a problem.</i>

16:40.163 --> 16:41.407
Yeah, I ordered the pizza
already.

16:41.507 --> 16:43.658
<i>You need to</i>
<i>come home now.</i>
<i>(indistinct shouting)</i>

16:43.758 --> 16:47.048
What on earth
are they fighting about?

16:49.104 --> 16:50.599
How come
daddy was on tv

16:50.699 --> 16:52.370
And nobody told me?

16:52.470 --> 16:54.061
Who told you
he was on tv?

16:54.161 --> 16:56.821
Ethan told everybody
at school.

16:57.925 --> 16:58.953
Uh, you know what?

16:59.053 --> 17:01.017
Your daddy ran into
some trouble at work.

17:01.117 --> 17:02.178
For what?

17:02.661 --> 17:04.205
That's a little hard
to explain.

17:04.306 --> 17:05.736
Um...

17:06.409 --> 17:07.116
Oh.

17:07.502 --> 17:09.117
Do you remember the time
you took the cookie

17:09.218 --> 17:10.290
'cause katie didn't
have one,

17:10.390 --> 17:11.855
And so you ended up
doing something wrong

17:11.954 --> 17:14.335
Trying to help
your sister?

17:14.637 --> 17:17.458
But why was daddy on tv?

17:19.294 --> 17:20.540
Uh, because
what daddy took

17:20.641 --> 17:22.410
Was a little bit
more serious than that,

17:22.510 --> 17:24.493
So the police had to
take him to jail.

17:24.594 --> 17:25.560
So, daddy's a bad guy?

17:25.660 --> 17:27.336
No, your daddy's
not a bad guy.

17:27.435 --> 17:30.306
He just...
He made a mistake.

17:30.677 --> 17:31.726
Well, what are you two
worrying about?

17:31.826 --> 17:33.244
Mama's here.
I got this, okay?

17:33.344 --> 17:34.442
Now, go.
Get ready for dinner.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.777
Scoot. Go, go, go!

17:38.894 --> 17:41.643
(sighs) I just feel like
I keep breaking their hearts.

17:41.743 --> 17:43.466
You handled that
so well.

17:43.566 --> 17:45.699
I couldn't have done
half as good a job.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.033
(chuckles)
(doorbell rings)

17:47.133 --> 17:49.723
Oh. I hope
that's the pizza.

17:52.053 --> 17:53.369
Riley parks?

17:53.469 --> 17:54.730
Yes.

17:55.571 --> 17:56.971
It's from kyle.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.043
+

18:11.939 --> 18:13.404
Are you crazy?

18:13.673 --> 18:15.081
I have cops
searching the house,

18:15.181 --> 18:17.984
And you send
some stranger over
with dirty money?

18:18.084 --> 18:19.694
Play it out, kyle.

18:19.805 --> 18:21.804
How can we take care
of our kids
if we're both in jail?

18:21.904 --> 18:24.500
Well, the original plan
was for me
to deliver it myself.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.425
It doesn't matter.

18:25.525 --> 18:28.714
It's still dirty money
you stole
from innocent people.

18:28.814 --> 18:30.259
"innocent?"

18:30.528 --> 18:31.772
Vandermeyer steals
from everyone.

18:31.872 --> 18:34.360
Hell, that copper wire
was probably stolen
in the first place.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.965
It doesn't matter
what they did.

18:37.065 --> 18:38.417
We need to turn
that money in.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.766
If you give that money
to the cops,

18:39.866 --> 18:41.825
You are giving
the prosecution
the evidence that they need

18:41.925 --> 18:43.868
To convict me.

18:44.308 --> 18:46.073
Is that
what you want to do?

18:46.173 --> 18:48.847
You want to
send me to prison?

18:48.947 --> 18:51.972
You're doing a fine job
of that on your own.

18:52.072 --> 18:53.344
Okay.

18:53.770 --> 18:56.673
I'm not saying
what I did was right.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.263
You think this is the man
that I ever wanted to be?

18:59.363 --> 19:01.968
You don't understand
how desperate I was.

19:02.068 --> 19:03.677
I mean, I hated
what I was doing,

19:03.777 --> 19:05.976
And it tore me up
inside.

19:06.076 --> 19:09.016
But I felt
like I had no choice.

19:09.568 --> 19:10.612
Now, I need you
to promise me

19:10.712 --> 19:15.122
That you're not gonna make
any rash decisions here.

19:16.741 --> 19:20.101
Riley: Let me
introduce you
to selena.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.300
Oh, riley, hey.
Um, I'm leaving early.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.901
Check out
this sale at nieman's.

19:25.001 --> 19:27.335
Thank god
for these alerts.

19:27.435 --> 19:31.568
33% off of
an $825 bag.
That's like...

19:31.668 --> 19:34.785
The total is $587.30,

19:35.051 --> 19:38.722
Which is a savings
of $272.25.

19:38.822 --> 19:40.395
Well, nobody likes
a show-off.

19:40.495 --> 19:42.059
(scoffs)
who the hell are you?

19:42.159 --> 19:43.794
This is nikki,
our new girl,

19:43.894 --> 19:45.989
And apparently
a very good
math student.

19:46.089 --> 19:47.434
Oh. Really?

19:47.534 --> 19:48.449
Nikki.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.334
Well, do this math.

19:50.434 --> 19:52.520
More employees
cut into my purse fund,

19:52.620 --> 19:53.459
So you should leave.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.274
She's gonna be
in room 7.

19:55.374 --> 19:57.673
I do have good memories
of room 7.
(chuckles)

19:57.773 --> 20:00.756
You know what?
Your client's here.
His name is walter.

20:00.856 --> 20:01.661
Walter.

20:03.853 --> 20:05.001
I don't like that girl.

20:05.101 --> 20:06.516
Why? 'cause she's good
at math?

20:06.616 --> 20:08.380
No. No.
I don't trust her.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.288
She was eavesdropping
on our conversation.

20:10.388 --> 20:12.383
Oh, good lord.
Will you relax?

20:12.483 --> 20:13.564
We need help
with the client list,

20:13.664 --> 20:15.457
And this might be
our girl.
Selena, stop that.

20:15.557 --> 20:17.261
Yeah, right.
That's if you
can trust her.

20:17.361 --> 20:18.829
Well, we'll know
soon enough.

20:18.929 --> 20:20.049
(scoffs) how?

20:20.264 --> 20:22.294
'cause I'm testing her.

20:25.461 --> 20:27.926
Your shoulders
are really tight.

20:28.026 --> 20:31.751
Yes, I got a lot
of emotional tension
built up.

20:31.851 --> 20:34.750
Are there any other areas
you would like for me
to work on?

20:34.850 --> 20:38.462
Yeah,
you bet there is.
But first...

20:39.417 --> 20:42.707
Will you pass me
that box of tissues?

20:44.721 --> 20:46.752
(knock on door)
yeah. Come in.

20:46.852 --> 20:47.924
(door opens)

20:49.389 --> 20:51.662
Hey, there.
How was the first massage?

20:51.762 --> 20:53.390
It's always the...
Hardest.

20:53.490 --> 20:56.025
Yeah. Since
you brought it up...

20:56.125 --> 20:59.379
Look, I'm not trying
to get anyone in trouble,

20:59.479 --> 21:01.105
And I really need
this job,

21:01.205 --> 21:02.873
But my client, walter...

21:02.973 --> 21:05.342
He asked me
for a happy ending.

21:05.442 --> 21:07.762
Oh, god.
That sounds awful.

21:07.862 --> 21:11.567
- But you know what I mean.
- Oh, yes, and I am sorry.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.263
Yeah. That,
that won't happen again.
I'm gonna talk to him.

21:14.363 --> 21:15.610
I'm not gonna lie.

21:15.710 --> 21:17.529
It was kind of tempting.

21:17.629 --> 21:20.290
He offered me
a really big tip.

21:20.390 --> 21:21.558
Really big.

21:21.658 --> 21:23.961
So...
What stopped you?

21:24.432 --> 21:25.780
You've just been
so cool to me,

21:25.880 --> 21:30.220
And I know that this isn't
that kind of a place.

21:30.741 --> 21:32.771
What if I said it was?

21:34.029 --> 21:36.390
Look, 90% of what
we do here is legit,

21:36.490 --> 21:38.240
But the other 10%...

21:39.089 --> 21:41.270
Is what walter asked for.

21:43.413 --> 21:47.151
No wonder
selena can afford
that $587.30 purse.

21:47.251 --> 21:48.265
(chuckles softly)

21:48.365 --> 21:52.775
Look, what happens
in your room
is totally private.

21:53.673 --> 21:55.459
And listen...

21:55.647 --> 21:56.663
You don't have to do
anything

21:56.763 --> 21:59.562
That you're not
comfortable with.

21:59.662 --> 22:01.365
(doorbell rings)

22:01.465 --> 22:03.298
(mug thuds)

22:05.856 --> 22:07.771
Hi, I'm karina...
Ethan's mom.

22:07.871 --> 22:09.796
I'm linette.
Come on in.

22:09.896 --> 22:13.729
I'm here to drop off
some refinancing paperwork
for riley.

22:13.829 --> 22:16.607
Your son, ethan,
owes travis an apology.

22:16.707 --> 22:17.617
Excuse me?

22:17.772 --> 22:21.902
You had no business
telling your son about kyle.

22:22.006 --> 22:23.354
I am so sorry.

22:23.572 --> 22:24.425
It wasn't me.

22:24.525 --> 22:26.464
He was with his daddy
over the weekend.

22:26.564 --> 22:29.057
He probably saw it
on the news.

22:29.157 --> 22:30.828
No. I'm sorry.

22:31.254 --> 22:33.430
This has just been so hard
on everyone.

22:33.530 --> 22:35.600
I'll talk to ethan
and make sure
he apologizes.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.744
I would never want to
upset riley.

22:37.844 --> 22:39.917
I've been in her shoes.

22:40.017 --> 22:43.831
So, do you mind giving her
these refi papers to sign?

22:43.931 --> 22:45.912
Sure. I'll make sure
she gets them.

22:46.012 --> 22:46.922
Thank you.

22:47.121 --> 22:49.711
And, again,
I'm really sorry.

22:56.052 --> 22:58.186
(knock on door)

22:58.433 --> 22:59.620
We got a problem.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.724
Uh, okay.
I'll be right there.

23:05.432 --> 23:07.427
(lock engages)

23:08.426 --> 23:09.133
(sighs)

23:09.620 --> 23:12.787
Selena, you need to get
in your uniform right now.

23:12.887 --> 23:15.439
Well, out of all the spas
in all the world,

23:15.539 --> 23:16.866
You guys got to
walk into mine.

23:16.966 --> 23:17.708
And for good reason.

23:17.808 --> 23:20.237
The money
from the stolen wire
still hasn't turned up.

23:20.337 --> 23:21.399
Maybe it never will.

23:21.499 --> 23:23.425
Or maybe kyle gave it
to someone he trusts,

23:23.525 --> 23:25.550
And they were smart enough
not to leave it
at their house.

23:25.650 --> 23:27.320
That's an
interesting theory.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.625
You're a detective.
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

23:30.725 --> 23:32.823
So you don't mind
if we take a look
around, then?

23:32.923 --> 23:35.583
Can I see
your search warrant?

23:36.023 --> 23:37.528
Aw, darn.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.185
I guess you guys
are just gonna have to
show yourselves out.

23:41.285 --> 23:43.167
We'll be back
with one, riley...

23:43.267 --> 23:44.835
Sooner rather than later.

23:44.935 --> 23:47.245
And I look
forward to it.

23:50.059 --> 23:50.988
(sighs)

23:51.088 --> 23:53.198
(train whistle blows)

24:06.996 --> 24:07.906
Excuse me.

24:08.245 --> 24:11.115
I'm looking
for mick vandermeyer.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.787
Man: Yo! Mick!

24:13.427 --> 24:15.680
Someone's here
to see you.

24:15.780 --> 24:16.995
What can I do you for?

24:17.095 --> 24:19.770
I'm riley parks,
kyle's wife.

24:19.870 --> 24:21.705
Oh, it's a shame
about kyle.

24:21.805 --> 24:24.141
Breaks my heart to have
to do this to him,

24:24.241 --> 24:25.695
But I had to set
an example.

24:25.795 --> 24:27.654
Look, I know that you think
my husband made a mistake,

24:27.754 --> 24:29.012
But he wasn't involved.

24:29.112 --> 24:31.142
So, you came here
thinking,

24:31.242 --> 24:33.440
With your beauty
and your obvious charms,

24:33.540 --> 24:34.513
That you could convince me

24:34.613 --> 24:37.015
That your husband
didn't steal a semi truck
full of copper wire?

24:37.115 --> 24:40.877
No. Actually, I came here
to square his account.

24:40.977 --> 24:42.276
I took that
from our family savings.

24:42.376 --> 24:46.477
I have two kids at home
that really miss their daddy.

24:46.577 --> 24:49.657
And the half
that his partner took?

24:49.868 --> 24:51.887
I don't, I don't know
anything about a partner.

24:51.987 --> 24:54.838
Look, I'm just here
to clear up the confusion
about kyle.

24:54.938 --> 24:56.854
Okay. But if you still feel
like you need more money,

24:56.954 --> 24:59.810
Then I can make
that happen, too.

24:59.910 --> 25:00.777
(chuckles)

25:01.423 --> 25:05.470
You know, I wish my third...
Hell, even my fourth wife

25:05.570 --> 25:07.885
Were as stand-by-your-man
as you are, mrs. Parks.

25:07.985 --> 25:09.777
I'm standing by my kids.

25:09.877 --> 25:12.423
I understand that.
I truly do.

25:12.523 --> 25:14.969
And I'm a man who believes
in squaring accounts.

25:15.069 --> 25:15.826
Good.

25:15.926 --> 25:17.799
So, then, you're gonna drop
the charges against kyle

25:17.899 --> 25:20.129
As long as I can get you
the rest of that money?

25:20.229 --> 25:23.729
That would be
the christian thing to do.

25:24.452 --> 25:26.762
But I'm spiritually adrift.

25:27.466 --> 25:31.358
As far as I'm concerned,
I've never met you.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.720
You never gave me
a bag of cash.

25:33.820 --> 25:36.194
And my suggestion is,
next time,

25:36.294 --> 25:39.180
Pick a man
worth standing by.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.884
Now get out of here.

25:49.474 --> 25:51.626
(breathes deeply)

25:51.726 --> 25:52.545
+

25:55.876 --> 25:58.177
(jazz piano music plays)

26:01.491 --> 26:02.917
(sighs)

26:04.210 --> 26:05.916
You look like
you could use a drink.

26:06.016 --> 26:07.912
(sighs)
I wish a drink
could fix all this.

26:08.012 --> 26:09.412
What's going on?

26:09.512 --> 26:11.297
I don't even know
where to start.

26:11.397 --> 26:13.061
I mean, this kyle thing...
It's a real mess.

26:13.161 --> 26:14.896
And it's not just
affecting me personally.

26:14.996 --> 26:17.036
It's affecting
the business.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.897
Do you remember
those two detectives
I told you about...

26:18.997 --> 26:20.529
The ones
that searched my house?

26:20.629 --> 26:21.637
They came to the rub.

26:21.737 --> 26:23.657
Did they look around?
No. They couldn't.

26:23.757 --> 26:24.718
They didn't have
a search warrant,

26:24.818 --> 26:26.516
But I'm gonna tell you,
they're gonna get one.

26:26.616 --> 26:29.611
A warrant
to search the rub?

26:29.906 --> 26:30.904
I mean,
if the clients find out

26:31.004 --> 26:32.380
That the cops paid us
another visit,

26:32.480 --> 26:33.500
We're gonna lose everyone.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.851
Maybe I could make
a few phone calls,

26:35.951 --> 26:37.152
Call in a favor.

26:37.252 --> 26:39.535
Mr. Louboutin kept the cops
off your back.

26:39.635 --> 26:41.253
Let's see
if he can help again.

26:41.353 --> 26:44.003
Oh, georgia,
I didn't mean to get you
caught up in all this.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.393
Oh, honey.
We're family.

26:45.493 --> 26:48.223
Family look out
for each other.

26:48.382 --> 26:49.382
Thank you.

26:52.066 --> 26:53.368
(birds chirping)

26:53.468 --> 26:54.345
I can't.

26:54.445 --> 26:55.470
Kyle gave this one
to me.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.725
I mean, maybe I should
just call evan and cancel.

26:57.825 --> 26:58.876
With all that's happening,

26:58.976 --> 27:01.156
You need to take
a couple hours just for you,
don't you think?

27:01.256 --> 27:03.553
No, what I think
is that I should stay in.

27:03.653 --> 27:07.713
No. You're going out.
You deserve to be happy.

27:07.869 --> 27:09.384
Um... Ah!

27:09.579 --> 27:11.720
Remember?
I got you this one.

27:11.820 --> 27:14.022
Yeah. I mean,
how can I be happy, though?

27:14.122 --> 27:15.559
My life's a big hot mess.

27:15.659 --> 27:16.860
You have
two beautiful kids.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.326
Well, that's very true,

27:18.426 --> 27:19.925
But you know what?
Let's review.

27:20.025 --> 27:22.006
I'm ashamed to tell them
what their mama does
for a living.

27:22.106 --> 27:24.308
I have a top-secret life
in sugar land.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.801
My husband leaves me,
then comes back,

27:26.901 --> 27:28.351
Gets himself
thrown in jail

27:28.451 --> 27:30.159
For stealing
copper wire.

27:30.259 --> 27:31.596
Who steals
copper wire?

27:31.696 --> 27:35.312
And on top of that,
I'm dating
my husband's brother.

27:35.412 --> 27:37.301
Word.
I mean,
I am one step away

27:37.401 --> 27:39.180
From being a guest
on  <i>jerry springer.</i>

27:39.280 --> 27:41.141
(chuckling)
I love that show.

27:41.241 --> 27:42.384
I do!

27:42.641 --> 27:44.686
(both laughing)
what did I miss?

27:44.786 --> 27:46.554
Oh! So much, mama.

27:47.061 --> 27:48.549
You two been hitting
the chardonnay?

27:48.649 --> 27:49.489
You wish.

27:49.657 --> 27:50.558
Where are you
off to?

27:50.658 --> 27:53.178
No need to be nosy.
(laughs)

27:53.594 --> 27:55.063
Anything you want to
tell me?

27:55.163 --> 27:57.584
So badly,
but I'm not going to.

27:57.684 --> 27:58.664
Lacey jean.

27:58.865 --> 28:02.925
What, what's that, travis?
Aunt lacey's coming!

28:03.677 --> 28:05.077
I can't believe

28:05.472 --> 28:07.108
We have this
whole place to ourselves.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.963
How'd you manage it?

28:09.063 --> 28:11.260
I did some roofing
for the owner last week.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.920
Told him I wanted to
bring someone special,

28:13.020 --> 28:15.680
So he shut down early
for us.

28:18.478 --> 28:20.018
(sighs)
you okay?

28:20.201 --> 28:23.771
Yeah. Everything's great.
(chuckles softly)

28:24.916 --> 28:27.006
You know,
as much as I love that

28:27.106 --> 28:29.106
Beauty-queen smile
of yours,

28:29.206 --> 28:31.499
I can tell when
something's upsetting you.

28:31.599 --> 28:32.400
You want to
talk about it?

28:32.500 --> 28:34.023
(sighs)
I'm just so mad at kyle,

28:34.123 --> 28:35.070
I don't even want to
look at him,

28:35.170 --> 28:38.041
And every time I try
to fix this whole thing,
it just gets worse.

28:38.141 --> 28:42.343
Well, maybe I can help
keep your mind off it
for a little bit.

28:42.443 --> 28:44.036
(chuckles softly)

28:46.242 --> 28:47.549
Yay!

28:47.649 --> 28:49.415
(laughs)

28:53.146 --> 28:55.864
You know,
watching you lose
is getting tiring.

28:55.964 --> 28:57.488
Watch this.

28:57.689 --> 29:00.053
<i>♪ did you see that shining</i>

29:04.400 --> 29:05.433
My club is bent.

29:05.533 --> 29:08.015

are calling it?

29:13.453 --> 29:15.243
Come on. Let's see
if I got a hole in one.

29:15.343 --> 29:17.478
Don't you mean
a hole in two?

29:17.578 --> 29:18.379
It didn't come out.

Kyle:  <i>Hey, I just got</i>

29:41.436 --> 29:43.157
I was hoping
I could say hi to the kids.

29:43.257 --> 29:44.888
Uh, not right now.

29:45.148 --> 29:46.003
Why not?

29:46.407 --> 29:48.004
Because I'm not at home.

Sure.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.792

29:58.892 --> 30:02.140
You mind telling the kids

30:02.240 --> 30:04.357
Yeah. I'll tell them.

30:08.228 --> 30:09.430
(cell phone beeps)

30:09.530 --> 30:11.032
(sighs)

30:11.278 --> 30:13.168
Okay.
(chuckles)

30:13.687 --> 30:17.543
Wow. Um, can we just
rewind that whole last part?

30:17.643 --> 30:19.708
Tough to do,
but we can try.

30:19.808 --> 30:21.376
I'm sorry.

30:21.719 --> 30:23.523
I mean, I really am
trying to get back

30:23.623 --> 30:24.869
To where we were
when he was gone,

30:24.969 --> 30:27.507
But he's just
not gone anymore.

30:27.607 --> 30:29.083
No. He's not.

30:29.986 --> 30:33.621
But I'm not giving up
getting us where
we need to go.

30:33.721 --> 30:34.722
(chuckles softly)

30:34.822 --> 30:36.656
(ball rattles)

30:39.993 --> 30:40.495
(gasps)

30:40.595 --> 30:42.427
And I think the universe
agrees with me.

30:42.527 --> 30:46.568
(laughs) yeah, but it still
took away your hole in one.

30:46.668 --> 30:49.538
I think that means
I win, right?

31:03.016 --> 31:04.152
(sighs)

31:04.252 --> 31:06.354
Last night
was amazing.

31:06.454 --> 31:07.553
(chuckles softly)

31:07.653 --> 31:09.855
Hurry back.

31:28.677 --> 31:31.645
I hope you had
a nice time last night.

31:31.745 --> 31:34.246
Linette: Riley!
(gasps)

31:36.855 --> 31:38.471
Well, did you?

31:38.571 --> 31:40.001
Did I what, mama?

31:40.101 --> 31:41.797
Have a good time
last night.

31:41.897 --> 31:43.087
Well, get your robe on.

31:43.187 --> 31:46.757
Katie's costume
isn't gonna stuff itself.

31:51.179 --> 31:52.550
Here.
Hold the tail.
Oh.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.638
Mama, are you sure
this is not
too much stuffing?

31:54.738 --> 31:57.431
It's supposed to be
an armadillo,
not a big, old t-rex.

31:57.531 --> 32:00.199
This is texas.
Go big or go home.

32:00.299 --> 32:03.309
Hey, thank you
for helping me out.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.327
Oh, the banker lady
stopped by.

32:05.427 --> 32:06.715
She wanted me
to give you this.

32:06.815 --> 32:07.756
What's going on?

32:07.856 --> 32:09.480
I need money
for kyle's bail.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.719
Are you really gonna take on
more debt for him?

32:11.819 --> 32:13.151
What do you
want me to do?

32:13.251 --> 32:14.527
I mean, just let him
stay in jail?

32:14.627 --> 32:15.808
How does that
help the kids?

32:15.908 --> 32:19.014
Ugh. I just need
this whole thing to go away.

32:19.114 --> 32:20.897
Maybe I could help
with the money.

32:20.997 --> 32:23.645
I could sell
that little parcel of land
that bill left me.

32:23.745 --> 32:24.832
Mama, no.

32:25.105 --> 32:27.037
Brixton ranch?
You love that place.

32:27.137 --> 32:29.618
Oh. Some of my best memories
were fishing off that bridge.

32:29.718 --> 32:32.512
"ranch?" it's a tin shack
on a muddy creek.

32:32.612 --> 32:36.097
Well,
I appreciate the offer,
but I got this.

32:36.197 --> 32:38.444
At what cost?

32:39.387 --> 32:41.742
I know
what you're hiding.

32:41.842 --> 32:43.733
Riley, you can talk to me
about all these things.

32:43.833 --> 32:46.930
You don't have to
keep all these secrets.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.718
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:48.818 --> 32:49.457
Yes, you do.

32:49.557 --> 32:51.788
I didn't raise you stupid,
and my mama
didn't raise me stupid.

32:51.888 --> 32:52.722
I know that.

32:52.822 --> 32:54.062
If you're scared
to talk to me

32:54.162 --> 32:55.179
About all
you've been hiding

32:55.279 --> 32:56.671
'cause you think I won't
be all right with it,

32:56.771 --> 32:58.882
I want you to know
your mama's all right
with it.

32:58.982 --> 33:00.370
Okay, mama.
Just to be clear,

33:00.470 --> 33:02.187
You're saying...

33:02.287 --> 33:04.025
That you're okay with...

33:04.125 --> 33:05.555
You dating evan.

33:05.655 --> 33:07.335
Why wouldn't I be?

33:07.809 --> 33:10.433
I can't slip anything
past you.

33:10.533 --> 33:12.428
I know
all your secrets.

33:12.528 --> 33:15.883
And I'm so grateful that this
is what we're talking about.

33:15.983 --> 33:17.752
(cell phone ringing)

33:18.690 --> 33:19.506
Ah.
(cell phone beeps)

33:19.606 --> 33:20.769
Hey, georgia.

33:20.869 --> 33:22.899
I called in that favor.

33:23.138 --> 33:26.519
You don't have to worry
about those detectives
snooping around the rub.

33:26.619 --> 33:28.222
How can I ever repay you?

33:28.322 --> 33:30.459
<i>It's not me</i>
<i>you have to repay.</i>

33:30.559 --> 33:33.534
He asked for
a little favor of his own.

33:33.634 --> 33:34.815
(groans)

33:36.331 --> 33:37.676
He said
he wants to do what?

33:37.776 --> 33:39.835
Mr. Louboutin
wants two girls
at the same time.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.094
Now, come on, selena,
you know you love
these shoes.

33:43.194 --> 33:44.939
I'm more
of a handbag girl, but...

33:45.039 --> 33:46.812
I'll do it.

33:47.858 --> 33:50.399
Eavesdropping.
I told you
I don't trust her.

33:50.499 --> 33:53.131
Well, you snooze, you lose.
Nikki, you're in.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.129
No sex, right?

33:54.229 --> 33:57.180
Absolutely not.
Just some kinky stuff.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.322
You know,
he's a real nice man,
generous with his tips.

33:59.422 --> 34:00.592
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

34:00.692 --> 34:01.750
Will you get
out of here?

34:01.850 --> 34:03.407
I'm in.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.033
Tuition's due.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.883
How's your pedicure?

34:08.069 --> 34:09.964
Um...
Hmm.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.418
(chuckles softly)

34:11.518 --> 34:13.688
Hey, judge.
Hey, darling.

34:13.793 --> 34:16.594
Look, I can't
thank you enough.

34:17.469 --> 34:18.585
And for these, too.

34:18.686 --> 34:19.650
(both laugh)

34:19.751 --> 34:21.748
Well, I have to look out
for my girls.

34:21.849 --> 34:23.074
Well,
I really appreciate it.

34:23.174 --> 34:25.620
Now, look,
I got a little surprise
for you today.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.420
You do?
I do.

34:28.297 --> 34:30.121
(laughs)

34:30.667 --> 34:32.556
Well, let's see, now.

34:32.927 --> 34:34.594
I'm guessing...

34:35.431 --> 34:37.431
Maybe a size 7?

your business.

35:51.772 --> 35:53.174
I give massages
for a living.

35:53.274 --> 35:56.599
Who would I know
that has that kind of power?

35:56.699 --> 35:58.907
Riley, you in
some kind of trouble?

35:59.007 --> 36:00.547
Whatever it is,
I can help.

36:00.647 --> 36:02.489
I'm not just a cop.
I'm your friend.

36:02.589 --> 36:04.058
But be warned
the deeper you get
into this,

36:04.158 --> 36:05.762
The harder it's gonna be
to get out.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.617
And if kyle's pulled you
into something,

36:07.717 --> 36:11.209
It won't just be the money
or your freedom
you could lose.

36:11.309 --> 36:13.320
It'll be your family.

36:14.012 --> 36:15.678
Thank you.

36:16.143 --> 36:18.124
I'll see you around.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.864
I lost my appetite.
(chuckles)

36:22.397 --> 36:26.877
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.740
(crickets chirping)

36:31.840 --> 36:34.570
Lacey: Don't move.
Let me see!

36:34.670 --> 36:35.790
Oh, my gosh!

36:36.078 --> 36:38.651
You are
the prettiest armadillo
in all of texas!

36:38.751 --> 36:40.215
But where are you?

36:40.315 --> 36:42.275
(gasps)
there you are!

36:42.376 --> 36:44.551
(laughs)
go get your brother.

36:44.651 --> 36:45.809
Oh.
She is so cute.

36:45.909 --> 36:46.775
_

36:46.875 --> 36:50.025
So... Who's all,
uh, coming tonight?

36:50.225 --> 36:53.358
Uh, you know, the usual...
You, mama...

36:53.458 --> 36:54.849
Evan?
Yes.

36:54.949 --> 36:57.912
And if you want to know
about the date, just ask.

36:58.012 --> 36:59.009
Great. Where'd you go?

36:59.109 --> 37:00.102
Where'd he take you?
What'd you do?

37:00.202 --> 37:01.353
I felt
like a princess.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.934
Oh, and a kiss
from the prince?
Did I say that?

37:04.034 --> 37:05.441
Ooh.
Was it a good kiss?

37:05.541 --> 37:07.565
No,
I'm not gonna tell!

37:07.665 --> 37:08.765
Hello!
Hey!

37:08.893 --> 37:10.328
You guys look great!

37:10.428 --> 37:12.286
I want you both to know
that I'm very proud of you,

37:12.386 --> 37:15.950
And I know
that your daddy
would be, too.

37:16.050 --> 37:18.787
Okay. Come on.

Morning.

39:56.344 --> 39:58.982
Well, hey.
You missed a heck
of a show last night.

39:59.082 --> 40:01.650
I know.
And now
I can see why.

40:01.750 --> 40:03.161
My god.
Are you okay?

40:03.261 --> 40:03.961
What happened?
I'm fine.

40:04.061 --> 40:07.284
I just got called in
to the night shift

40:07.384 --> 40:10.163
And got into
a little tussle
with a 4x6.

40:10.263 --> 40:12.110
So, you punched
a 4x6?

40:12.210 --> 40:14.430
Imagine my surprise
when it punched back.

40:14.530 --> 40:17.450
That's your story?
You're sticking to it?

40:17.550 --> 40:18.868
Yes, ma'am.

40:19.052 --> 40:20.032
Well, okay.

40:20.268 --> 40:21.917
So, how did katie do
at the show?

40:22.017 --> 40:24.269
Oh, well, other than
a little mobility issue

40:24.369 --> 40:26.422
With that, uh,
armadillo costume
that I made,

40:26.522 --> 40:28.910
It was, I must say,
quite beautiful.

40:29.010 --> 40:29.675
(laughs)

40:29.775 --> 40:33.065
Well, I know beautiful
when I see it.

40:34.082 --> 40:36.406
Wow, this is, uh...

40:38.587 --> 40:39.587
Yeah.

40:43.624 --> 40:44.875
Do you hear that?

40:44.975 --> 40:46.935
I don't hear a thing.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.732
My point exactly.

40:48.832 --> 40:51.071
Hmm. No kids...

40:51.832 --> 40:55.870
No nosy mama
hanging around.

40:56.629 --> 40:57.906
Oh, yeah.

40:58.153 --> 40:59.875
Yeah, that's good.
Keep talking.

40:59.975 --> 41:01.076
(laughs)

41:01.320 --> 41:05.128
So, this would be
our first time alone.

41:12.019 --> 41:13.388
(doorbell rings)

41:13.488 --> 41:15.461
Oh.
Are you kidding me?

41:15.561 --> 41:17.857
(groans)
sorry.

41:21.529 --> 41:23.360
Oh. Are you here
with another warrant?

41:23.460 --> 41:25.408
It's not about kyle.

41:26.819 --> 41:28.601
Um...

41:29.394 --> 41:30.738
I heard some news
on the scanner,

41:30.838 --> 41:33.238
And I wanted to be
the one to tell you.

41:33.338 --> 41:35.508
It's your mother,
