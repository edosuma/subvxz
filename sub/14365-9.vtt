00:03.910 --> 00:09.380
Special agent Fowler, please
come in.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.020
What's private Daley doing
here with that camera?

00:12.090 --> 00:16.890
He will be making a record of
today's session.

00:16.960 --> 00:22.200
Soldier...
too close.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.230
Sorry I didn't dress for the occasion.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.600
Formality won't be any more
necessary than usual, Bill.

00:27.670 --> 00:32.170
But I do need to inform you that
our higher-ups are on the war path.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.580
They want answers regarding
recent events.

00:34.650 --> 00:39.480
Perhaps we should begin with
the demise of Optimus Prime.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.430
I thought we straightened all
this out. Prime is alive and well.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.200
That's difficult for our
superiors to accept, without the

01:24.270 --> 01:28.210
benefit of seeing Optimus
and the alleged imposter.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.240
Side by side?

01:29.310 --> 01:31.910
That didn't seem to be the
wisest option at the time.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.350
<i>The sky jockeys were under</i>

01:34.420 --> 01:38.150
<i>direct orders to destroy any
and all Autobots on sight.</i>

01:38.220 --> 01:40.750
<i>We were in a heightened state
of security.</i>

01:40.820 --> 01:42.520
<i>Let's consider the positives.</i>

01:42.590 --> 01:45.660
We now possess greater intel
regarding M.E.C.H., particularly

01:45.730 --> 01:48.390
their leader, Silas ...
the stage name of one

01:48.460 --> 01:51.300
Colonel Leland Bishop,
ex-special tactics.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.930
The architect of project Damocles.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.370
Satellites in orbit firing
laser beams at any target on Earth.

01:58.440 --> 02:03.080
Long since mothballed, and the
primary reason for Bishop's discharge.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.410
<i>He had other wild ideas, which
he practiced with even greater</i>

02:06.480 --> 02:08.310
<i>abandon once he went rogue.</i>

02:08.380 --> 02:12.120
<i>And still, no sign of his remains.</i>

02:13.190 --> 02:19.490
<i>Of greater concern, M.E.C.H. agents,
like Silas, might also be special tactics.</i>

02:19.560 --> 02:21.190
<i>As in, currently enlisted?</i>

02:21.260 --> 02:23.860
<i>One obvious motive for hiding
their faces.</i>

02:23.930 --> 02:27.130
<i>I would urge a thorough
investigation, and leave bigger</i>

02:27.200 --> 02:30.040
<i>threats to metal hands more
capable than our own.</i>

02:30.100 --> 02:33.140
Because you've been allowed
to operate at such deeply

02:33.210 --> 02:37.040
classified levels, perhaps you
could provide some background.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.810
Our transforming visitors are
autonomous, robotic organisms

02:41.880 --> 02:45.420
from the planet Cybertron.
They were fighting a war.

02:45.490 --> 02:49.920
Foremost, over control of our
world's supply of Energon,

02:49.990 --> 02:54.930
the fuel and lifeblood of all
Autobots and Decepticons alike.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.330
Do you recall the period late in
the war, when both sides began

02:59.331 --> 03:02.593
hiding their Energon spoils, off-world?

03:02.594 --> 03:03.540
Of course.

03:03.575 --> 03:07.510
It's the reason Energon deposits
exist on planets such as this one.

03:07.580 --> 03:13.910
It is also the reason battles came
to be waged on planets such as this one.

03:13.980 --> 03:18.080
<i>These battles over Energon, and its
dark counterpart, continue to this day.</i>

03:18.150 --> 03:19.820
<i>And you know this for certain?</i>

03:19.890 --> 03:22.590
<i>I've seen more than enough to
make me a believer.</i>

03:22.660 --> 03:27.830
<i>But I rely upon field reports from team Prime,
which I, in turn, share with you.</i>

03:27.900 --> 03:33.000
Skip ahead, if you would, to the
history of your involvement, Agent Fowler.

03:33.070 --> 03:36.470
As you know, I wasn't
overjoyed with what I assumed

03:36.540 --> 03:39.070
was gonna be a bot-sitting
assignment.

03:39.140 --> 03:41.270
Prime!

03:41.340 --> 03:44.510
Wait. Don't tell me.
He's out pancaking a mini-mall.

03:44.580 --> 03:48.710
But its occupational hazards turned
out to be surprisingly severe.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.180
Bring the prod.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.490
<i>And, by now, the bots have saved
my bacon more times than I can count.</i>

03:54.560 --> 03:56.790
<i>Of course, I've returned the
favor a time or two...</i>

03:58.430 --> 04:01.490
Any time, fella.
Ground floor's coming fast.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.640
<i>...sometimes exercising my authority...</i>

04:12.110 --> 04:13.610
The girl comes with me.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.070
...sometimes relying
upon quick thinking.

04:16.140 --> 04:22.480
We were just... calibrating the
subsystems, and we, uh, had a... surge.

04:22.550 --> 04:26.180
But it's fine now.
How are you?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.250
<i>And I've made a few mistakes.</i>

04:32.030 --> 04:36.230
Ah! Not again!
Ah! Not this again!

04:36.300 --> 04:39.300
If you would, Agent Fowler,
provide a roll call.

04:39.370 --> 04:42.770
So, we'll know who's who in
the event another bot snaps?

04:42.840 --> 04:45.440
- Something like that.
- Well, there's...

04:45.510 --> 04:46.140
Bulkhead.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.970
Are you a car? I bet you're
a truck ... a monster truck!

04:49.040 --> 04:51.240
Do you like heavy metal?
How much do you weigh?

04:51.310 --> 04:53.380
Ever use a wrecking ball for
a punching bag?

04:53.450 --> 04:57.850
Look, Miko, before I became a
warrior, I was a laborer ... construction.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.250
I can build stuff. I can break stuff.
And that's it.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.520
Of course, big foot and I
don't always see eye to eye.

05:04.590 --> 05:08.430
Don't use that phone.
It's... out of order.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.630
<i>He may not be the most agile bot...</i>

05:10.700 --> 05:13.130
Whoa. Whoa.
Don't look down.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.440
<i>And he's the first to admit
he's no rocket scientist.</i>

05:17.500 --> 05:19.910
Come on, Doc. There's
nothing up there to scan.

05:19.970 --> 05:22.540
Switch it back! I want to
see the hoedown showdown!

05:22.610 --> 05:25.950
<i>But his brute strength is invaluable.</i>

05:28.550 --> 05:33.290
<i>Thankfully, the science angle
is more than covered by Ratchet.</i>

05:33.350 --> 05:36.120
The Doc can be a little...
tightly wound.

05:36.190 --> 05:41.160
Without my supervision?!
You want them to be right, don't you?

05:41.230 --> 05:42.790
Control freak.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.130
<i>But he brings his "A" game
when the situation calls for it.</i>

06:00.380 --> 06:03.380
It's all right.
I'm an emergency vehicle.

06:03.450 --> 06:07.690
<i>- Then there's Arcee.
- The motorcycle?</i>

06:07.760 --> 06:12.660
<i>Don't be fooled by the smaller
footprint. She leaves a mark.</i>

06:29.680 --> 06:31.540
<i>Bumblebee's the team scout.</i>

06:37.380 --> 06:42.250
<i>But the warrior-in-training seems
pretty accomplished, if you ask me.</i>

06:42.320 --> 06:46.660
<i>Arcee may be a bot of few words,
but Bumblebee doesn't use any ...</i>

06:46.730 --> 06:48.330
<i>that we can understand.</i>

06:49.760 --> 06:52.930
- I-It wants us to get in.
- No, just me.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.570
- How do you know that?
- It said so.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.740
<i>Turns out it's with good reason.
During the war for Cybertron,</i>

06:59.810 --> 07:03.540
<i>the poor kid got his voice box
torn out by Megatron.</i>

07:03.610 --> 07:08.280
<i>So, the Autobots aren't quite the
indestructible war machines we'd hoped.</i>

07:08.350 --> 07:09.410
<i>Don't misunderstand.</i>

07:09.980 --> 07:13.520
<i>They can take serious
punishment.</i>

07:16.090 --> 07:20.630
<i>But they do have their...
vulnerabilities.</i>

07:22.130 --> 07:24.160
Did you just scream like
a little girl?

07:24.230 --> 07:27.100
No!
Maybe...

07:27.370 --> 07:31.900
This may not be the finish
that we had planned, but if this

07:31.970 --> 07:38.980
is indeed the end, if we are to
become one with the Allspark...

07:39.050 --> 07:43.850
No. Cliffjumper's life
signal just went offline.

07:43.920 --> 07:49.390
If Cliff's gone, standing around
here sulking won't bring him back.

07:50.460 --> 07:53.760
<i>We learned that the hard way
when we lost Cliffjumper.</i>

07:53.830 --> 07:58.530
And, for the record, Cliffjumper
was the last Autobot casualty?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.530
I told you.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.900
The lifeless Autobot you have in
storage isn't Prime.

08:02.970 --> 08:04.000
It's a knockoff!

08:04.070 --> 08:07.940
We have only your word to go
on without any trace of Silas

08:08.010 --> 08:12.010
or the alleged technology M.E.C.H.
utilized to control said knockoff.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.410
A clean scrub is M.E.C.H.'s M.O.
You and I both know it!

08:15.480 --> 08:20.720
Your last debriefing indicated that
Optimus Prime had joined the Decepticons.

08:20.790 --> 08:24.220
Not willfully!
Prime had amnesia.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.920
I know I was clear on that.

08:25.990 --> 08:29.900
But you can see where outside
observers might connect the dots

08:29.960 --> 08:32.059
to the recent attack on our base.

08:32.130 --> 08:35.470
Bill, the five-stars have grown
nervous that we've been placing

08:35.539 --> 08:39.370
our trust in beings who could so
easily inflict harm if they

08:39.440 --> 08:41.409
chose to turn on us.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.080
That's why I've been asked to

08:46.150 --> 08:49.350
determine whether I should bring
you before a tribunal.

08:49.420 --> 08:50.120
Tribunal?

08:50.180 --> 08:53.490
They could shut down our operation ...
put me in jail.

08:59.595 --> 09:02.350
General Bryce, Prime is no
loose cannon.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.520
He's anything but.

09:03.590 --> 09:06.420
The bots may be big, but they
watch where they step.

09:06.490 --> 09:09.160
- Heck, even the kids ...
- Kids?

09:12.130 --> 09:15.430
that's what we call our
"in-house support team".

09:16.800 --> 09:21.440
<i>I wasn't aware you were utilizing
any of our resources other than yourself.</i>

09:21.510 --> 09:25.470
<i>They're... not enlisted.</i>

09:25.540 --> 09:29.980
<i>You've involved civilians in
a classified operation?</i>

09:30.050 --> 09:33.150
<i>Highly accomplished
civilians who contribute</i>

09:33.220 --> 09:38.650
<i>specialized expertise in...
computer science...</i>

09:38.720 --> 09:43.030
<i>medicine...
uh... communications.</i>

09:43.090 --> 09:44.360
I love breaking stuff!

09:45.660 --> 09:47.400
Twisted.
Bring the hurt!

09:47.460 --> 09:48.660
Nerd alert.
Duh.

09:48.730 --> 09:50.900
Zombie!
Smackdown in outer space.

09:50.970 --> 09:52.600
That was cool.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.270
So, they know how to take orders.

09:56.340 --> 09:58.440
You... could... say that.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.080
Welcome to K.O. Drive-In,
where every patty's a knockout.

10:01.150 --> 10:02.040
May I take your order?

10:02.110 --> 10:04.850
<i>But what they lack in
military discipline, they more</i>

10:04.920 --> 10:09.250
<i>than make up for with
outside-the-box problem-solving.</i>

10:09.320 --> 10:11.490
Nothing.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.790
Gee, imagine that.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.790
The fourth dimension has lousy
cellphone reception.

10:15.860 --> 10:18.860
Wait, guys, guys, guys.
The phone... rang.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.330
We're getting a signal.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.800
Maybe the Autobots can't see
or hear us because we're moving

10:24.870 --> 10:27.040
at hyperspeed or something.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.200
<i>Their courage is to be admired.</i>

10:35.050 --> 10:37.810
Hold him still!

10:45.720 --> 10:47.920
<i>They've proven, time and
again, that they're willing to</i>

10:47.990 --> 10:52.490
<i>put their lives on the line for their country...
and their planet.</i>

10:52.560 --> 10:55.100
<i>So, your civilians have made
enemy contact.</i>

10:55.170 --> 10:58.700
I never forget a face ...
even that of a human.

10:58.770 --> 11:02.800
You double-cross anyone, mine
is the face you'll never forget!

11:02.870 --> 11:04.610
Never!!

11:04.680 --> 11:07.080
<i>They've [sighs]
pretty much seen it all.</i>

11:07.140 --> 11:08.980
- Miko, look away!
- But ...

11:09.050 --> 11:11.350
Turn your head away!

11:13.750 --> 11:15.150
Whoa.

11:15.220 --> 11:19.690
<i>Rest assured, the safety of these humans ...
of all humans ...</i>

11:19.760 --> 11:22.360
<i>remains the primary concern
of the Autobots.</i>

11:22.430 --> 11:24.460
They have no protective shell.

11:24.530 --> 11:29.200
If they get underfoot, they will go...
squish.

11:29.270 --> 11:34.040
Then, for the time being, Ratchet,
we must watch where we step.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.170
<i>And our colleagues wouldn't
have it any other way.</i>

11:37.240 --> 11:39.780
I'm living a dream here in
"bot"-swana.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.250
And I will not allow you or
anyone else to shatter it!

11:43.310 --> 11:46.180
<i>They've forged meaningful
bonds with the bots.</i>

11:46.250 --> 11:47.420
Where's Arcee?

11:48.220 --> 11:50.850
Why don't you just marry her?!

11:50.920 --> 11:52.590
I'm right behind you.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.330
<i>And they provide valuable
assistance whenever I'm</i>

11:58.400 --> 12:01.000
<i>otherwise engaged in the field.</i>

12:01.060 --> 12:03.630
<i>You've reached special Agent
William Fowler.</i>

12:03.700 --> 12:08.270
<i>I'm currently on an intensive training
retreat and unavailable until Tuesday.</i>

12:08.340 --> 12:10.110
I hate talking to machines.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.610
<i>But their involvement was
never intended to be anything</i>

12:13.680 --> 12:17.180
<i>other than humanitarian ...
to provide the Autobots with the</i>

12:17.250 --> 12:20.850
<i>means of better understanding
life on our planet.</i>

12:20.920 --> 12:23.420
A scout should be silent but deadly.

12:25.920 --> 12:26.560
What?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.420
Maybe it needs one of these
doohickeys.

12:28.490 --> 12:29.960
You're a motorcycle, Arcee.

12:30.030 --> 12:32.830
Shouldn't you know how to build
a motorcycle engine?

12:32.900 --> 12:36.160
You're a human, Jack.
Can you build me a small intestine?

12:36.230 --> 12:39.600
You want me to not only
bridge you into a confined space

12:39.670 --> 12:42.200
but one traveling at 90 miles per hour?!

12:42.270 --> 12:45.410
I can't even count the number of
ways that can go wrong ...

12:45.480 --> 12:50.280
mass displacement, trauma, twisted
limbs, metal burn.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.810
Well, maybe not the last one.

12:52.880 --> 12:58.450
<i>Sadly, we haven't begun to take
full advantage of their science.</i>

13:01.790 --> 13:06.390
<i>I mean, I can pilot my v-tol without
ever having to wear a flight suit.</i>

13:06.460 --> 13:09.130
<i>What keeps your organs from
exploding?</i>

13:09.200 --> 13:13.340
<i>A modification Ratchet performed
on the cabin-pressure regulator.</i>

13:13.400 --> 13:18.070
- I like to be comfortable.
- We... may be getting off track.

13:18.140 --> 13:19.810
Please address why we haven't

13:19.880 --> 13:23.710
yet been served Megatron's steel
head on a silver platter.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.080
No!

13:26.150 --> 13:31.120
<i>The leader of the Decepticons
has nine lives, plain and simple.</i>

13:33.860 --> 13:35.760
Well, I'm staring right at him.

13:35.830 --> 13:39.660
Good news is, Megatron
isn't exactly staring back.

13:39.730 --> 13:41.730
<i>It's not like we haven't tried.</i>

13:41.800 --> 13:44.430
Raaaah!

13:44.500 --> 13:48.940
<i>The sick part is, the moment we
might have pulled it off, we needed him.</i>

13:49.010 --> 13:52.110
<i>Megatron actually
helped us save humanity.</i>

13:52.180 --> 13:55.640
Optimus, our past alliances ...
Autobot, Decepticon ...

13:55.710 --> 14:01.080
no longer matter ...
not while Unicron lives.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.280
<i>Elaborate.</i>

14:02.350 --> 14:06.660
<i>We found ourselves facing an even
greater threat than M.E.C.H. or the Decepticons.</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:10.990
Literally an enemy within ...
Unicron.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.960
I know this is gonna sound
crazy, but what if I had told you

14:14.030 --> 14:19.300
our planet's core isn't made up of
what science has led us to believe it is?

14:21.410 --> 14:25.110
Agent Fowler, I'm sorry to say
I'm forced to discontinue this

14:25.180 --> 14:29.340
debriefing until you undergo
a full psychological evaluation.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.480
Seriously?

14:30.550 --> 14:33.850
As a representative of the
United States Government,

14:33.920 --> 14:37.620
I believe that you may have lost
your sanity.

14:42.235 --> 14:45.240
General Bryce, I assure you
that I am quite sane.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.940
It defies all logic, Bill.
Dark Energon?

14:49.010 --> 14:51.540
Then you go on record saying
that you believe in magical

14:51.610 --> 14:55.010
horses with horns on their heads.

14:55.080 --> 14:55.910
What?

14:55.980 --> 15:01.990
Do you deny previously reporting
that Megatron helped defeat a Unicorn?

15:03.160 --> 15:05.260
That's what you...

15:05.320 --> 15:08.390
Unicron!
The ultimate evil!

15:08.460 --> 15:10.630
Permission to strike
this from the record.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.630
Granted.
But consider yourself on notice.

15:15.030 --> 15:18.240
<i>You were saying.
Megatron proved to be an ally.</i>

15:18.300 --> 15:20.570
<i>The circumstances were
unique.</i>

15:20.640 --> 15:24.070
<i>Oddly, the 'con most likely to
be of service is Starscream ...</i>

15:24.140 --> 15:29.980
<i>only be default ... because he may despise
his team more than he despises ours.</i>

15:31.450 --> 15:33.220
No, master!

15:33.290 --> 15:37.690
Starscream's loyalty to Megatron
has always been questionable.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.430
If he has truly split from the
Decepticons, our prisoner's

15:41.490 --> 15:45.200
knowledge of their agendas could
make him a valuable ally.

15:45.260 --> 15:48.700
Megatron tried to extinguish
my Spark in cold blood!

15:48.770 --> 15:51.400
Then all that replaced me with
that traitorous wretch,

15:51.470 --> 15:56.070
Airachnid, she abandoned me!
Left me for scrap!

15:56.140 --> 15:58.480
So why not rat them out?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.210
<i>But even after Megatron
attempted to terminate him,</i>

16:01.280 --> 16:03.710
<i>Starscream still tried to win
his master's faith.</i>

16:03.780 --> 16:07.220
Imagine Megatron's
appreciation when I not only

16:07.290 --> 16:10.850
rescue him but deliver an Autobot.

16:10.920 --> 16:15.560
I believe that would restore my
stature quite nicely.

16:15.630 --> 16:19.730
<i>Starscream's insecurity is
what makes him less predictable</i>

16:19.800 --> 16:23.730
<i>than Megatron and, in some ways,
even more dangerous.</i>

16:25.840 --> 16:29.440
I make the decisions here.
I am in charge!

16:29.510 --> 16:31.210
<i>He really needs to figure out</i>

16:31.280 --> 16:34.210
<i>if it's Megatron's job he wants
or Megatron's approval.</i>

16:34.280 --> 16:38.880
<i>I must, in turn, ask why successful
termination of Starscream has not been achieved.</i>

16:38.950 --> 16:42.220
<i>Air superiority continues to
provide the 'Cons with the upper</i>

16:42.290 --> 16:46.420
<i>hand, though we manage to
inflict the occasional setback.</i>

16:46.490 --> 16:49.160
Ow!

16:49.230 --> 16:50.790
But the fact remains ...

16:50.860 --> 16:55.530
Starscream has supplied valuable
intel since he went rogue.

16:55.600 --> 17:01.410
Starscream: "I have obtained
information regarding your leader.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.410
Bring medical kit."

17:03.480 --> 17:07.240
<i>Not to worry ... The bots know
better than to trust him implicitly.</i>

17:07.310 --> 17:12.420
One step and your precious
biomech is scrap.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.589
<i>Fortunately for us, despite
his strategic brilliance,</i>

17:15.650 --> 17:18.190
<i>Starscream is his own worst enemy.</i>

17:22.790 --> 17:23.990
What?

17:28.450 --> 17:30.750
My T-cog!

17:30.820 --> 17:31.950
You're grounded?

17:32.170 --> 17:35.870
<i>And he isn't the only one
who's taken flight from Megatron.</i>

17:35.940 --> 17:37.110
<i>The spider.</i>

17:37.180 --> 17:40.410
<i>Airachnid ...
as sadistic as they come.</i>

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
<i>And she and Arcee have quite a history.</i>

17:42.550 --> 17:46.850
<i>I can't help but feel the next time they
lock horns, only one's gonna walk away.</i>

17:46.920 --> 17:49.420
<i>Unless Megatron gets to Airachnid first.</i>

17:49.490 --> 17:52.890
<i>So, the infighting among the
Decepticon ranks continues.</i>

17:52.960 --> 17:54.320
<i>And then some.</i>

17:54.390 --> 17:59.660
<i>Megatron can't seem to keep his
inner circle holding hands.</i>

17:59.730 --> 18:02.630
<i>And you don't think we could
take advantage of the chaos?</i>

18:02.700 --> 18:05.500
<i>Motivate a Decepticon to join our cause?</i>

18:05.570 --> 18:08.870
<i>There is one whom
Prime seems to respect.</i>

18:08.940 --> 18:12.810
While it is unlikely that any
Decepticon will choose the path

18:12.880 --> 18:16.850
of good, even they possess the
potential for change.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.720
<i>But having witnessed Dreadwing tear
up a town, I wouldn't hang my hopes on it.</i>

18:20.790 --> 18:22.350
<i>So I must press the point ...</i>

18:22.420 --> 18:25.560
<i>if Optimus believes that even
a Decepticon holds the potential</i>

18:25.620 --> 18:27.990
<i>for change, why couldn't the
reverse be true?</i>

18:28.060 --> 18:31.500
<i>No one truly knows what went on
behind the Decepticon curtain</i>

18:31.560 --> 18:36.000
<i>while Optimus was off the grid ...
not you, not the Autobots.</i>

18:36.070 --> 18:39.200
<i>I'm 100% with Ratchet on this one.</i>

18:39.270 --> 18:42.810
Being a Decepticon is a
choice, Agent Fowler ... one that

18:42.880 --> 18:47.480
I have a hard time believing Optimus
would make at any point in his life.

18:47.550 --> 18:52.250
Orion Pax may not currently be
an Autobot up here, but I must

18:52.320 --> 18:56.920
believe he will never stop being
one in here.

18:56.990 --> 19:04.130
<i>Against all odds, suffering amnesia, Prime
engineered his own escape to face down Megatron.</i>

19:04.200 --> 19:06.900
<i>But is Prime capable of change?</i>

19:06.970 --> 19:09.070
You know your problem, Optimus?

19:09.130 --> 19:13.740
For such a big, strong bot,
you're soft.

19:13.810 --> 19:17.510
You didn't pound Megatron into
scrap when you had the chance ...

19:17.580 --> 19:19.610
many chances, in fact!

19:19.680 --> 19:23.710
You might as well use your
drill to finish me.

19:23.780 --> 19:26.780
What are you waiting for?
Think of the glory?

19:26.850 --> 19:30.450
Seize the day.
Optimus would.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.660
No, he wouldn't.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.760
So, tell me, Optimus ...

19:34.830 --> 19:40.260
do you intend to take me alive or
end this here and now?

19:41.130 --> 19:43.730
<i>Prime has recently proven
he's willing to go further than</i>

19:43.800 --> 19:47.900
<i>ever to protect humanity.
Optimus Prime is a true patriot.</i>

19:47.970 --> 19:51.740
<i>He and his team continue to risk
their lives, day in and day out,</i>

19:51.810 --> 19:54.340
<i>asking absolutely nothing in return.</i>

19:54.410 --> 19:58.880
If you don't survive, Optimus,
I fear neither will this planet.

19:58.950 --> 19:59.950
Very well.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.660
<i>The simple fact is, Prime doesn't
have a bad circuit in his body.</i>

20:04.720 --> 20:05.890
Move it, gramps!

20:07.190 --> 20:11.190
Agent Fowler, is that really necessary?

20:11.260 --> 20:14.730
As liaison to the Autobots,
I strongly caution that now would

20:14.800 --> 20:18.970
be the worst time to call
Prime's dedication into question.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.640
<i>We're on the verge of an even
greater threat than we faced before.</i>

20:22.710 --> 20:26.480
<i>The Decepticons are on the hunt for
long-buried relics from Cybertron.</i>

20:26.550 --> 20:29.810
<i>Preliminary intel suggests they
could be sacred objects with</i>

20:29.880 --> 20:33.650
<i>mystical properties or weapons
of mass destruction.</i>

20:33.720 --> 20:36.620
- Mystical?
- Uh, strike that, too!

20:36.690 --> 20:38.760
The point I'm trying to make
here is ...

20:39.890 --> 20:41.990
Hold on!

20:42.060 --> 20:44.490
Prime? I need an assist.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.340
Agent Fowler, have you
uncovered M.E.C.H. agents?

20:54.410 --> 20:58.110
No. They're okay.
General Bryce here just needs

20:58.180 --> 21:01.240
to confirm the state of your
health and welfare.

21:01.310 --> 21:05.920
I am fine, General Bryce.
How are you?

21:05.980 --> 21:08.720
I'm well, uh, soldier.

21:11.820 --> 21:17.290
Bill... I believe I have everything
I need to make a persuasive case

21:17.360 --> 21:20.130
that Optimus Prime is, indeed,
alive and well...

21:20.200 --> 21:22.700
and firmly on our side.

21:22.770 --> 21:26.940
- We appreciate your support, sir.
- Dismissed.
