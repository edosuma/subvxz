<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:02.761 --> 00:03.963
HEWES: He's my only child.

00:04.081 --> 00:07.257
He left me with his baby
daughter to take care of.

00:07.346 --> 00:09.672
Michael's suing me for
custody of Catherine.

00:09.781 --> 00:12.135
GULICKSON: If I'm going to
find your friend Sanchez,

00:12.230 --> 00:14.753
I need to know there's actually
a story worth writing about.

00:14.828 --> 00:17.765
PARSONS: They were conducting
offensive operations for the CIA

00:17.875 --> 00:19.260
and High Star knew about it.

00:19.341 --> 00:21.174
ERICKSON: I need this thing
with Sanchez wrapped up quickly.

00:21.272 --> 00:24.336
You keep Carter out of this.
Those two go back a long ways.

00:25.128 --> 00:27.272
BARTKOWSKI: I need it to look
just like that, you understand?

00:27.353 --> 00:30.106
HEWES: Mr. Erickson, can you identify
the person in this photograph?

00:30.200 --> 00:31.406
ERICKSON: No, I cannot.

00:31.479 --> 00:34.796
HEWES: That's surprising, because
on the day that your men were killed,

00:34.881 --> 00:37.727
Mr. Boorman instructed your
men to seize this boy.

00:37.821 --> 00:40.428
ERICKSON: That last mission--
was the asset a child?

00:40.510 --> 00:43.563
BOORMAN: You have very
important information.

00:43.701 --> 00:46.845
I want to know the truth about
what happened to your mother.

00:46.945 --> 00:49.166
You are the devil.

00:49.298 --> 00:52.116
BOORMAN: You still interested in
what I know about Howard Erickson?

00:52.197 --> 00:53.554
HEWES: That depends
on what you know.

00:53.652 --> 00:56.031
BOORMAN: I can serve him
up to you, Ms. Hewes...

00:56.975 --> 00:58.059
on a platter.

(breathing heavily)

02:57.939 --> 02:58.577
(gunshot)

03:08.998 --> 03:10.783
Clear!
Clear.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.579
(keys jingling)

03:30.119 --> 03:31.288
BOORMAN: Wait out here.

04:01.029 --> 04:02.578
HEWES: So what do you
got for me?

04:03.996 --> 04:06.889
BOORMAN: I figure we might
as well start from the beginning.

04:08.801 --> 04:09.917
HEWES: And when was that?

04:10.024 --> 04:11.822
BOORMAN: Late '80s. Afghanistan.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.365
The Marines sent over a Special
Forces unit to help the Agency

04:16.487 --> 04:20.961
train the mujahideen against the
Soviets. Erickson led the team.

04:21.642 --> 04:25.226
HEWES: So you and Erickson
hit it off, I gather.

04:25.673 --> 04:28.404
BOORMAN: I realized that
he could be useful.

04:28.993 --> 04:33.082
Howard was a rare breed,
a true believer.

04:34.438 --> 04:37.178
HEWES: So how did Dust
Devil come about?

04:37.725 --> 04:40.899
BOORMAN: After Abu Ghraib, it
suddenly seemed like a bad idea

04:41.021 --> 04:45.097
to have United States military
handling terror suspects.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.329
HEWES: So you
recruited Erickson.

04:48.368 --> 04:50.810
BOORMAN: High Star
was a perfect fit.

04:50.901 --> 04:53.445
Howard was ready to pitch in.

04:53.979 --> 04:56.005
There was only one thing
he wanted from us.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.789
HEWES: His government
contracts guaranteed.

05:00.048 --> 05:04.691
BOORMAN: He was risking his whole
company by doing something illegal.

05:05.226 --> 05:07.610
He just needed to
ensure an upside.

05:08.138 --> 05:12.231
So I used my influence to make sure
the contracts kept going his way.

05:14.193 --> 05:17.980
We started snatching low-level
Taliban and Al Qaeda types.

05:18.607 --> 05:21.965
Used some enhanced
interrogation techniques.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.789
HEWES: You mean torture.

05:27.349 --> 05:30.834
Did any innocent civilians
get caught in the net?

05:32.661 --> 05:35.585
BOORMAN: In my line of work,
you never bat a thousand.

05:39.419 --> 05:42.335
HEWES: Tell me about
the last mission.

05:42.526 --> 05:44.011
BOORMAN: Well, you were right.

05:44.424 --> 05:47.846
The Agency shut down Dust
Devil way before then, but...

05:48.927 --> 05:50.979
Howard decided to be a hero.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.262
He went in after a
target on his own.

05:54.020 --> 05:59.041
Turned out what made him useful
also made him unreliable.

05:59.743 --> 06:03.213
And now, we can't
control him anymore.

06:04.302 --> 06:08.632
HEWES: So that's why you're willing to...
give him up?

06:10.242 --> 06:14.891
BOORMAN: We would be very happy
if you took him off our hands.

06:17.602 --> 06:19.540
HEWES: What about the boy?

06:20.039 --> 06:24.136
BOORMAN: Now, that piece...
You got that all wrong.

06:24.265 --> 06:25.995
I'm protecting the boy.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.886
And it's not connected
with Dust Devil at all.

06:30.902 --> 06:32.458
He's a political refugee.

06:32.547 --> 06:34.565
Afghanistan's no
longer safe for him.

06:35.139 --> 06:36.569
HEWES: Who is he?

06:37.153 --> 06:39.426
BOORMAN: I had an
asset in the region.

06:39.519 --> 06:41.502
That asset provided information;

06:41.602 --> 06:44.009
in return, I'm
protecting her son.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.126
HEWES: So why do you want
to make a deal with me?

06:49.900 --> 06:52.110
BOORMAN: Because you
know about the boy.

06:54.227 --> 06:58.093
And if you pursue him, you
could put the kid in danger.

06:59.486 --> 07:03.286
HEWES: So you'll give me Erickson,
if I keep away from the boy?

07:05.470 --> 07:06.686
Mm-hmm.

07:10.591 --> 07:12.411
Seems reasonable.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.355
BOORMAN: I'll be in touch, then.

07:18.433 --> 07:25.425
You and Ms. Parsons will have everything
you need to topple Erickson's empire.

07:33.682 --> 07:36.110
PARSONS: He can't be
more than 11 or 12.

07:38.534 --> 07:41.002
We know where Boorman
is holding him, right?

07:41.934 --> 07:45.846
HEWES: Yes. The Frenchwoman gave an
address along with the photograph.

07:47.755 --> 07:50.851
PARSONS: Probable cause for a search
warrant is going to be a challenge.

07:50.967 --> 07:53.446
I don't see how we can
contact the police on this.

07:53.714 --> 07:55.274
HEWES: No, we can't.

07:55.379 --> 07:59.289
Boorman will just claim that he's
seeking asylum on the child's behalf.

07:59.551 --> 08:01.941
PARSONS: The woman who gave you the
information, what did she think?

08:02.050 --> 08:04.415
HEWES: She thought Boorman
was interrogating him.

08:04.522 --> 08:07.690
PARSONS: But she wasn't certain that the
boy was the target for Chris' mission.

08:07.972 --> 08:11.185
HEWES: Ellen, we both saw Erickson's
reaction to this at the deposition.

08:11.304 --> 08:15.148
PARSONS: I know, I'm just saying, we
can't be sure Chris knew about this.

08:16.443 --> 08:18.838
HEWES: Well, there's only
one way to find out.

08:20.277 --> 08:23.674
We have to somehow
talk to the boy.

08:38.371 --> 08:40.043
CARTER: If you don't
eat today, Sancho...

08:58.698 --> 09:00.645
Drink, Mr. Sanchez.

09:00.775 --> 09:02.998
We have a long way to go yet.

09:13.972 --> 09:15.224
(exclaims in Pashto)

09:18.823 --> 09:20.517
(engine starting)

09:25.079 --> 09:27.744
CARTER: I'm sorry, sir,
but this is unacceptable.

09:27.892 --> 09:30.101
ERICKSON: I just had
Sanchez moved, that's all.

09:30.647 --> 09:31.767
CARTER: Why?

09:32.113 --> 09:35.487
ERICKSON: It's precautionary, I don't
like that reporter hanging around.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.910
CARTER: - Bullshit, sir.
ERICKSON: - Excuse me?

09:38.114 --> 09:39.856
CARTER: You didn't
just have him moved.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.781
I know what's going on.

09:41.924 --> 09:43.467
ERICKSON: I don't like
what you're implying, A.C.

09:43.589 --> 09:47.052
CARTER: Sir, I don't think you
understand why I'm upset.

09:47.371 --> 09:48.980
Now if Sanchez has to go,
he has to go,

09:49.077 --> 09:51.838
but what pisses me off is you
keeping me out of the loop.

09:53.698 --> 09:56.075
Have I not proven my
loyalty to you, sir?

09:56.184 --> 09:59.660
ERICKSON: - Yes, you have.
CARTER: - I'm here to serve you.

10:00.407 --> 10:02.384
And the mission of this company.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.009
But I can't do my job if
I'm kept in the dark.

10:06.118 --> 10:09.549
ERICKSON: A.C., whatever's going on...

10:10.426 --> 10:12.344
I'm trying to protect you.
Do you understand?

10:12.437 --> 10:14.854
CARTER: And if I'm going to keep working
for this company, I need to know.

10:14.951 --> 10:16.121
ERICKSON: I understand.

10:16.229 --> 10:17.523
CARTER: Who's running
point for you on this?

10:17.673 --> 10:19.025
ERICKSON: Bartkowski.

10:20.155 --> 10:24.027
CARTER: With your permission,
sir, I'd like to talk to him.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.235
ERICKSON: I'll see that he
brings you up to speed ASAP.

10:29.751 --> 10:31.402
CARTER: Thank you, sir.

10:32.892 --> 10:35.414
Now, the judge has looked
over both of your custody claims,

10:35.503 --> 10:38.925
and she's ordered mediation as a
means of resolving this dispute.

10:39.415 --> 10:40.740
MICHAEL: Yes, sir.

10:41.967 --> 10:44.470
Now, experience has shown that we...
we tend to get a

10:44.559 --> 10:47.342
better result if we just have
a conversation and keep it...

10:47.663 --> 10:48.964
keep it casual.

10:49.386 --> 10:50.854
HEWES: Sounds good.

10:51.139 --> 10:53.929
Now, I would like to get a
feel of how far apart we really are,

10:54.017 --> 10:58.317
so, uh... what custody arrangements
would seem fair to you, Ms. Hewes?

11:00.122 --> 11:06.223
HEWES: Well, my son abandoned
his child, I legally adopted her,

11:06.386 --> 11:10.006
and I will never let
him see Catherine.

11:11.750 --> 11:12.958
Okay.

11:13.065 --> 11:15.805
So, uh, we have some
distance to bridge here.

11:17.117 --> 11:18.637
MICHAEL: May I say something?

11:18.752 --> 11:19.752
Of course.

11:19.905 --> 11:24.683
MICHAEL: For as long as I can remember,
my mother and I have been at war,

11:25.098 --> 11:27.716
and it's gotten to the
point where, honestly,

11:28.455 --> 11:31.018
I don't even know what we're
fighting about anymore,

11:31.730 --> 11:34.310
but it's not about Catherine.

11:35.078 --> 11:37.130
All right, I'm...
I'm not sure I follow you.

11:37.216 --> 11:39.819
MICHAEL: There's a reason I ran
away when my daughter was born.

11:44.068 --> 11:46.307
I wasn't ready to be a father.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.280
See, I've made a
lot of mistakes.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.908
There's a lot about
myself I don't respect.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.472
I probably don't
even like myself.

11:55.606 --> 11:56.922
But...

11:59.216 --> 12:01.629
it's time I stopped blaming you.

12:04.239 --> 12:09.293
Since I was a kid, I knew if I made my
mom the enemy, my life had a purpose.

12:10.591 --> 12:12.923
As... as long as I could
label her the bully,

12:13.041 --> 12:16.119
I could maintein a
self-righteous fury that

12:16.197 --> 12:20.289
justified whatever bad
behavior I needed it to.

12:23.815 --> 12:25.542
But it's a lie.

12:26.394 --> 12:28.241
She's not the enemy.

12:29.377 --> 12:32.220
My mom has shown me love
the best way she could.

12:34.190 --> 12:35.492
I see that now.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.466
And I know she'll be a better
parent than I ever will.

12:42.704 --> 12:45.546
What exactly are you trying
to achieve here today?

12:46.581 --> 12:48.505
MICHAEL: I want to
withdraw my claim.

12:52.197 --> 12:54.594
I want to make peace
with my mother.

12:56.785 --> 13:01.860
I want her to know that I love
her and I'm grateful she loves Catherine

13:01.956 --> 13:05.064
enough to give her
everything that I can't.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.225
Mom,

13:19.948 --> 13:21.693
will you please stand up?

13:32.841 --> 13:35.293
(sighing)

13:53.447 --> 13:54.884
PARSONS: You okay?

13:55.661 --> 13:57.002
You don't want to eat?

13:57.563 --> 13:58.573
Hmm?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.843
You miss your daddy, don't you?

14:05.484 --> 14:07.051
So do I.

14:10.102 --> 14:11.688
EVERETT: Talking to dogs now?

14:13.124 --> 14:14.366
PARSONS: Hey.

14:16.473 --> 14:20.043
Ghwarri won't eat.
Something's off.

14:20.537 --> 14:21.518
EVERETT: Hmm.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.262
Patty lets you
bring her to work?

14:25.728 --> 14:28.435
PARSONS: She likes dogs.
She doesn't mind.

14:30.026 --> 14:33.098
I was going to leave her home,
but the idea of her in the

14:33.185 --> 14:35.688
apartment by herself-- I
just didn't have the heart.

14:36.727 --> 14:37.999
(Everett chuckles)

14:38.871 --> 14:40.644
- What?
EVERETT: - Nothing.

14:41.323 --> 14:42.775
It's sweet how you
take care of her.

14:42.867 --> 14:45.400
- I was wondering, though...
PARSONS: - What?

14:45.997 --> 14:48.746
EVERETT: I can't think of a
restaurant that seats dogs.

14:50.749 --> 14:54.207
PARSONS: Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I didn't...

14:54.304 --> 14:55.695
EVERETT: Don't worry about it.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.777
PARSONS: Let's just go to
my place and order takeout.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.019
EVERETT: - Sounds good.
PARSONS: - Okay.

15:03.306 --> 15:04.804
Come on.
Come on.

16:17.939 --> 16:20.681
BOORMAN: I can make you tell me.

16:26.455 --> 16:30.442
(clicking)

17:07.005 --> 17:09.693
BOORMAN: Yeah.
That's right, kid.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.198
I'm the devil.

17:13.045 --> 17:14.607
(grunting)

17:42.432 --> 17:45.069
(panting, grunting)

17:46.017 --> 17:47.523
BOORMAN: Uh...

18:02.483 --> 18:03.864
I'm sorry.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.211
GULICKSON: Go talk to that guy.

18:12.679 --> 18:13.680
What?

18:13.785 --> 18:15.995
BILAL: - Money for cigarettes.
GULICKSON: - Right.

18:44.113 --> 18:47.129
BILAL: It sounds like they were here.
Three men driving yellow car.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.684
GULICKSON: Did they say
where they were going?

18:48.803 --> 18:50.243
BILAL: North to Waygal District.

18:50.415 --> 18:52.396
You cannot go there.
Too dangerous.

18:52.712 --> 18:55.307
GULICKSON: - I've heard.
BILAL: - Taliban controlled.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.183
Very religious.
Very anti-American.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.730
You will not last three minutes.

19:05.873 --> 19:08.262
HERNDON: Ah. You know what?

19:08.876 --> 19:10.969
That cabdriver overcharged me.

19:11.436 --> 19:14.410
I know because the fucking
meter was rigged.

19:16.017 --> 19:18.448
I mean, because the numbers
kept going up and up and up.

19:18.518 --> 19:19.566
You know what I mean?

19:19.666 --> 19:21.191
HEWES: Hey. Come on.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.431
HERNDON: Hey! What? What?

19:24.609 --> 19:25.954
What do you want from me now?

19:26.354 --> 19:28.120
HEWES: Come on. Come on inside.

19:28.238 --> 19:33.669
Let me make you a cup of coffee.
Right in here.

19:37.584 --> 19:40.163
HERNDON: Okay, so, uh, Boorman
has got this boy locked up

19:40.250 --> 19:42.653
and he wants you to believe
he's protecting the kid, huh?

19:44.243 --> 19:46.630
- That's bullshit.
HEWES: - Yeah, it is.

19:46.730 --> 19:49.165
HERNDON: Yeah, that's...
that's... that's bullshit.

19:50.953 --> 19:53.636
HEWES: We just wanted to
update you on the case.

19:53.821 --> 19:57.145
HERNDON: "We"?
Gidget still on this thing with you?

19:57.438 --> 19:59.368
HEWES: - Yes.
HERNDON: - Ah, that's nice.

20:01.464 --> 20:02.207
(grunts)

20:02.288 --> 20:05.170
HEWES: We know we never would've
gotten this far without you, Bill.

20:06.966 --> 20:08.755
And your friend.

20:11.161 --> 20:12.454
HERNDON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:12.533 --> 20:14.875
HEWES: - I am just so sorry.
HERNDON: - Yeah.

20:15.205 --> 20:20.071
Julius-- he was loyal.
He was one of the good guys.

20:20.782 --> 20:22.707
Yeah, Julius.

20:23.051 --> 20:25.677
He fed me information
for over 20 years.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.624
(scoffs)

20:30.707 --> 20:34.709
HEWES: Bill, please. Please!
Let me get you some help.

20:35.765 --> 20:37.154
HERNDON: - You want to help me?
HEWES: - Yes.

20:37.261 --> 20:38.705
HERNDON: You really
want to help me?

20:39.418 --> 20:42.493
Then you get the son of a bitch.

20:42.605 --> 20:44.823
You do not let Boorman
off the hook.

20:45.850 --> 20:49.574
HEWES: - I don't intend to.
HERNDON: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:50.745 --> 20:53.694
You mean, you're not gonna make a
deal with him to get to Erickson?

20:55.026 --> 20:58.939
HEWES: Of course not.
I want them both.

21:11.413 --> 21:13.884
BOORMAN: Sitting nice
and pretty up there.

21:16.732 --> 21:20.228
Next week, we'll go to Arthur Kill
Park across from Staten Island.

21:20.361 --> 21:22.095
You'll like it there.

21:24.343 --> 21:28.450
Sorry I haven't been able to get
you outside as often as I'd like.

21:29.616 --> 21:33.619
Circumstances really
haven't allowed for it.

21:53.966 --> 21:55.657
(panting)

22:16.572 --> 22:17.707
Was she here?

22:17.907 --> 22:18.870
Did somebody take her?

22:23.343 --> 22:24.812
Goddamn it!

22:28.817 --> 22:31.103
You don't know, do you?

22:34.511 --> 22:37.567
You never knew what
happened to your mother.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.367
I'm not sure what
to do with you.

22:51.773 --> 22:52.883
(chuckles softly)

22:53.805 --> 22:58.432
First time in my life
I haven't got a plan.

23:15.621 --> 23:18.934
BARTKOWSKI: That's how it'll look.
No tracks, no traces.

23:19.581 --> 23:22.486
Sanchez was captured and killed
for terrorist propaganda.

23:23.432 --> 23:24.675
CARTER: Where they taking him?

23:24.779 --> 23:26.861
BARTKOWSKI: - Waygal District.
CARTER: - Smart.

23:28.354 --> 23:30.385
If it happens there,
nobody can question it.

23:30.489 --> 23:32.062
BARTKOWSKI: That was the idea.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.006
CARTER: I'm putting you up
for promotion, Bartkowski.

23:39.883 --> 23:41.498
HUNTLEY: L-Let me
get this straight.

23:41.598 --> 23:44.470
You want me to
kidnap this child?

23:44.962 --> 23:48.498
HEWES: I just want to know
how we can get to him.

23:49.133 --> 23:51.217
I need to ask him
some questions.

23:52.340 --> 23:55.601
HUNTLEY: And in order to do that,
I've got to kidnap the kid?

23:56.010 --> 23:58.515
Or-or break into a
CIA safe house.

23:58.612 --> 24:01.641
HEWES: I believe this boy is
being held against his will.

24:02.843 --> 24:05.277
HUNTLEY: Right, but you
have no evidence for that.

24:06.214 --> 24:11.103
I mean, you do realize you're
speaking to a former police officer?

24:11.781 --> 24:16.334
HEWES: Let me explain to you
exactly what the stakes are here,

24:16.945 --> 24:19.694
then you decide whether or
not you want to be involved.

24:21.592 --> 24:23.266
HUNTLEY: Oh, I'm listening.

24:48.533 --> 24:50.984
PARSONS: Sorry.
I was just texting you.

24:52.171 --> 24:53.928
For once, I'm not late.

24:54.192 --> 25:00.459
EVERETT: Actually, I wasn't gonna come,
but I figured we should talk in person.

25:01.989 --> 25:03.762
Oh. What is it?

25:06.956 --> 25:08.310
Us.

25:09.420 --> 25:13.255
PARSONS: - Wha...
EVERETT: - It's not working for me.

25:13.839 --> 25:15.377
I need to move on.

25:16.576 --> 25:21.932
PARSONS: I'm sorry, I, um...
I just did not expect you to say that.

25:23.145 --> 25:25.589
EVERETT: You've been thinking about
your friend in Afghanistan.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.075
PARSONS: I've been focusing
on his case, yeah.

25:28.266 --> 25:29.573
EVERETT: I understand that.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.817
Anyway, that's not what
I really wanted to say.

25:33.638 --> 25:38.574
Look, I know we agreed that this
thing between us would be casual,

25:38.681 --> 25:42.763
but I realized it's
too casual for me.

25:43.135 --> 25:45.177
PARSONS: I know my head has
been buried in work. I'm s...

25:45.270 --> 25:48.897
EVERETT: Don't apologize.
I'm not blaming you for being yourself.

25:49.286 --> 25:50.851
PARSONS: And who is that?

25:50.993 --> 25:51.908
(Everett chuckles)

25:52.678 --> 25:54.610
EVERETT: I don't want to
psychoanalyze you or anything.

25:54.858 --> 25:57.231
PARSONS: No, it's okay.
I-I want to hear it.

26:02.518 --> 26:05.327
EVERETT: You have no idea how
ambitious you really are.

26:07.450 --> 26:10.761
Your whole identity is
wrapped up in success.

26:13.084 --> 26:16.813
It's like you're on the career carousel,
and if you got off, you'd be lost.

26:19.363 --> 26:21.853
I should probably stop talking.

26:21.964 --> 26:27.524
PARSONS: It's okay.
I'm-I'm interested. It's fine.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.865
EVERETT: I've seen a lot of brilliant
lawyers come through the firm.

26:32.022 --> 26:36.271
They all start out hungry, they all
put in the hours and kick ass.

26:36.910 --> 26:38.827
But there are really two types.

26:40.016 --> 26:44.664
Half of them-- especially the
women-- they realize they want

26:44.755 --> 26:46.511
something more than
just a career.

26:46.611 --> 26:49.237
They want kids, a family.

26:49.596 --> 26:54.264
They start looking for ways to create
a balance and scale back or quit.

26:54.682 --> 26:56.242
PARSONS: And the other type?

26:56.608 --> 27:00.237
EVERETT: They never stop.
They can't.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.121
They just keep driving,

27:02.224 --> 27:06.568
because success is what makes
them feel good about themselves.

27:07.271 --> 27:10.767
Most of the men are too dumb
to realize it, but some of the women,

27:11.890 --> 27:16.433
as they get older, an
emptiness creeps in.

27:17.744 --> 27:20.893
And by the time they're ready for
something else, it's too late.

27:23.472 --> 27:27.092
They try to fill that emptiness
with more success, but they can't.

27:28.509 --> 27:32.402
I see their loneliness,
their regret.

27:34.559 --> 27:36.620
You say you want a life.

27:36.992 --> 27:39.721
You've told me you don't
want to end up like Patty.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.487
I hope you're not headed
in that direction.

27:46.475 --> 27:50.283
Please understand I'm telling you
all this because I care about you.

27:54.821 --> 27:58.832
I'm sorry. I should go.

28:09.071 --> 28:10.681
(music playing, people talking)

28:12.659 --> 28:14.974
Ah, Jerry. Good to see you.

28:16.003 --> 28:17.897
BOORMAN: Never heard
of a rain check?

28:18.122 --> 28:20.008
Kid had his heart
set on a barbeque.

28:20.309 --> 28:21.869
BOORMAN: I brought him
a little something.

28:21.964 --> 28:23.491
Ah, you didn't have to do that.

28:24.239 --> 28:26.936
BOORMAN: You don't turn 13
every day, now, do you?

28:27.192 --> 28:28.021
(both chuckle)

28:28.280 --> 28:30.062
I got something for you, too.

28:34.835 --> 28:36.194
It's all there.

28:36.394 --> 28:41.975
Social Security card, birth
certificate and the adoption papers.

28:42.164 --> 28:45.015
He's an American citizen now.
He's officially yours.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.748
BOORMAN: Thank you
for your help.

28:47.853 --> 28:52.200
Good luck with this, Jerry.
Hope it all works out.

28:58.117 --> 28:59.953
MICHAEL: Do you
have any sparkling?

29:02.364 --> 29:03.458
Thank you.

29:03.571 --> 29:04.970
Sorry I'm late.

29:05.588 --> 29:09.800
Ms. Hewes, Mr. Hewes.
Good to see you both again.

29:13.224 --> 29:15.726
So, Ms. Hewes, you were
gonna start today.

29:22.889 --> 29:24.072
What's that?

29:24.261 --> 29:25.853
HEWES: It's a panda.

29:26.510 --> 29:28.027
Okay.

29:28.743 --> 29:33.198
HEWES: I instructed my son that
he was not to go near Catherine.

29:33.515 --> 29:36.372
He approached her in the
street and he gave her this.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.867
MICHAEL: W-What's the problem?

29:38.955 --> 29:42.915
HEWES: It's a choking hazard, not
suitable for children under four.

29:43.003 --> 29:44.592
MICHAEL: Are you serious?

29:44.696 --> 29:48.918
HEWES: Now, either Mr. Hewes didn't
read the label or he doesn't care.

29:49.081 --> 29:51.609
In either case, I don't want
him near my daughter,

29:51.681 --> 29:55.008
and I will not amend the terms
of Catherine's custody.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.105
MICHAEL: You don't
remember this, do you?

29:59.196 --> 30:01.156
HEWES: You gave it to Catherine.

30:01.626 --> 30:04.466
MICHAEL: No. You gave it to me.

30:05.863 --> 30:10.757
When I was a kid, my mother was
working a case round the clock.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.087
Which was nothing new.

30:12.175 --> 30:15.736
But on this particular morning,
there was a mix-up at the nanny

30:15.810 --> 30:18.619
service and no one showed
up to take care of me.

30:19.369 --> 30:21.278
My mother had a
court appearance.

30:21.370 --> 30:24.634
Instead of rescheduling, she
handed me this stuffed animal.

30:24.761 --> 30:29.232
She told me he would be my
friend and would watch over me.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.650
I didn't see her again
for a few hours.

30:35.759 --> 30:38.096
Couldn't have been
more than five.

30:39.643 --> 30:43.385
HEWES: - That never happened.
MICHAEL: - Yeah, Mom, it did.

30:43.483 --> 30:45.770
HEWES: He just made
up that entire story.

30:46.790 --> 30:48.832
MICHAEL: Every word
of it is true.

30:51.857 --> 30:54.312
I know you think you can
convince this guy that you'll be

30:54.401 --> 30:57.779
a better parent for Catherine,
but you're a fraud

30:58.567 --> 31:00.463
and you'll never convince me.

31:02.636 --> 31:06.680
Well, I can see the court is
going to have to settle this.

31:09.570 --> 31:12.901
I'm sorry you two can't
find some middle ground.

31:17.419 --> 31:19.373
ERICKSON: I've been
thinking about the kid.

31:19.593 --> 31:24.135
BOORMAN: Oh, Howard, you don't
have to worry about that.

31:24.241 --> 31:27.826
ERICKSON: Why not? I told you--
the lawyers know about him.

31:27.943 --> 31:29.564
BOORMAN: Doesn't matter.

31:29.724 --> 31:32.257
They can't prove he was the
target of the mission.

31:32.365 --> 31:34.509
They can't touch you.

32:05.561 --> 32:07.326
ERICKSON: Hey, did you draw this?

32:08.131 --> 32:10.698
BOORMAN: Just something I
was fucking around with.

32:11.550 --> 32:14.333
ERICKSON: - You got a little talent.
BOORMAN: - Very little.

32:18.650 --> 32:20.561
ERICKSON: You know who
this reminds me of?

32:21.329 --> 32:23.795
That asset of yours in Charikar.

32:23.968 --> 32:27.365
BOORMAN: - Which asset?
ERICKSON: - Oh, come on, Jerry.

32:28.036 --> 32:31.139
How many women were supplying you
with information in Charikar?

32:31.248 --> 32:32.590
BOORMAN: Plenty.

32:32.684 --> 32:37.465
Turns out there's a whole slew of ladies
with bad things to say about the Taliban.

32:37.581 --> 32:40.385
ERICKSON: I only met the one,
and this sure looks like her.

32:41.800 --> 32:46.053
BOORMAN: Anyway, Howard, you don't
have to worry about the boy.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.504
Long as you take care of
Sanchez, you're in the clear.

32:51.609 --> 32:52.808
ERICKSON: That's good to know.

32:52.903 --> 32:56.302
Just out of curiosity, what
exactly does the kid know?

32:57.676 --> 32:59.806
BOORMAN: You know I
can't tell you that.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.377
But if he gives us any
information that'll help you do

33:02.477 --> 33:05.926
your job over there, you'll
be the first to know.

33:07.393 --> 33:09.006
ERICKSON: Thank you, Jerry.

33:13.929 --> 33:15.367
Have a good night.

33:23.444 --> 33:25.610
OWEN: You've known
Erickson for 25 years.

33:25.714 --> 33:27.683
All of a sudden, you're
willing to sell him out?

33:27.789 --> 33:29.866
BOORMAN: Erickson was an
asset-- nothing more.

33:29.976 --> 33:32.528
OWEN: So this is just about
you protecting the Agency?

33:33.584 --> 33:35.552
BOORMAN: Just as
I've always done.

33:36.670 --> 33:38.851
The man went rogue.

33:39.509 --> 33:42.311
He ordered an unauthorized
mission to pull out an

33:42.403 --> 33:47.267
unauthorized target, and he did
it using the Agency for cover.

33:48.373 --> 33:50.687
OWEN: You seem pretty
worked up about this.

33:50.806 --> 33:52.854
BOORMAN: He did it on my watch.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.261
OWEN: I don't believe you're
telling me the truth.

33:56.628 --> 33:58.183
You tell me Erickson went rogue.

33:58.279 --> 34:00.859
I just don't see what
would be in it for him.

34:00.969 --> 34:04.552
BOORMAN: That's my point exactly.
Man acts without reason.

34:06.056 --> 34:09.623
OWEN: If you want
Erickson, I need proof.

34:09.762 --> 34:14.420
I want to know who he pulled out
and why. I want details, specifics.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.542
BOORMAN: - Fuck you.
OWEN: - Excuse me?

34:16.641 --> 34:21.650
BOORMAN: You don't believe me?
Fuck you.

34:22.069 --> 34:24.039
OWEN: You aren't
helping your cause.

34:26.233 --> 34:33.337
BOORMAN: You're right.
I'm lying to you. It was me.

34:33.764 --> 34:37.913
I ordered that last mission.
Not Erickson; I did it.

34:40.167 --> 34:43.071
OWEN: - Why?
BOORMAN: - Don't matter.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.059
You're going to back me anyway.

34:47.164 --> 34:49.829
You are going to burn
Erickson for me.

34:49.945 --> 34:53.025
OWEN: - No, I'm not.
BOORMAN: - You want me to blow the whistle?

34:53.350 --> 34:55.654
Leak the whole
fucking operation?

34:55.744 --> 35:00.656
When Dust Devil goes public,
heads will roll, and sure as shit,

35:00.772 --> 35:05.090
- yours is going to be one of them.
OWEN: - And yours.

35:05.260 --> 35:09.189
BOORMAN (gasps): I don't give
a fuck what happens to me!

35:09.588 --> 35:13.030
I don't have a wife.
I don't have kids.

35:13.684 --> 35:17.627
I don't have a hard-on
to be director someday.

35:18.656 --> 35:20.858
But you do.

35:22.570 --> 35:29.140
So I suggest you give
me what I want, Bob.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.047
ERICKSON: Welcome home, soldier.

35:46.171 --> 35:47.436
BARTKOWSKI: Good
to be home, sir.

35:48.027 --> 35:49.613
I brought in that
container for you.

35:49.776 --> 35:51.109
Got a few more if you need them.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.160
ERICKSON: I only need the one.

35:53.254 --> 35:55.510
It's temporary office space
for the construction.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.010
BARTKOWSKI: New
property's impressive.

35:57.262 --> 36:01.690
ERICKSON: Oh, it's a shithole right now,
but she'll clean up fine-- just you wait.

36:02.404 --> 36:06.979
Listen... did a hell of a job
over there. A hell of a job.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.287
I know it was a
tough assignment.

36:10.404 --> 36:13.864
BARTKOWSKI: Some tours are easier
than others. Nature of the beast.

36:15.001 --> 36:17.887
ERICKSON: Carter put in papers
nominating you for a promotion.

36:18.060 --> 36:19.461
I couldn't agree with him more.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.471
I signed them as soon
as they hit my desk.

36:21.835 --> 36:24.256
BARTKOWSKI: - I'm honored, sir.
ERICKSON: - Nobody deserves it more.

36:25.079 --> 36:29.291
Why don't you take a break?
Come back to the office.

36:29.673 --> 36:32.715
Sign the documents and
have a drink to celebrate.

36:33.156 --> 36:35.124
BARTKOWSKI: Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.966
BOORMAN: Ghwarri.

36:53.117 --> 36:54.769
(Boorman speaking Pashto)

36:57.224 --> 36:58.555
(chuckling)

37:01.337 --> 37:03.000
Ghwarri.

37:03.411 --> 37:05.454
Ah. (Chuckles)

37:13.521 --> 37:15.678
I met her over in Afghanistan.

37:16.057 --> 37:18.892
Last time I saw her, she
was skin and bones.

37:19.197 --> 37:20.818
PARSONS: What do you want,
Mr. Boorman?

37:22.131 --> 37:25.708
BOORMAN: I assume you heard
I spoke with Patty Hewes.

37:25.904 --> 37:29.495
PARSONS: She told me.
Do you have information for me?

37:30.304 --> 37:32.667
BOORMAN: Well, I'm not
a messenger service.

37:32.852 --> 37:36.036
You'll have to subpoena the
CIA to get what you need.

37:36.174 --> 37:38.661
PARSONS: But we both know they're
not going to give me anything.

37:39.714 --> 37:43.536
BOORMAN: I made arrangements to
sidestep any clearance issues.

37:45.225 --> 37:48.531
Trust me.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

37:49.910 --> 37:53.068
PARSONS: Have you made any
arrangements for Chris Sanchez?

37:58.609 --> 38:00.905
BOORMAN: Uh, afraid you
got the wrong guy.

38:01.777 --> 38:06.300
Howard Erickson is responsible
for Mr. Sanchez.

38:06.413 --> 38:08.844
I don't even know where
your friend is right now.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.398
Subpoena that file, Ms. Parsons.

38:15.966 --> 38:20.296
Any demand you have,
Erickson will have to oblige.

38:32.490 --> 38:36.472
Traffic. Lincoln Tunnel's
a fucking shit show.

38:37.193 --> 38:39.095
HUNTLEY: Uh, here's the address.

38:40.694 --> 38:43.689
They're holding a young boy-- 11,
12 years old-- against his will.

38:44.031 --> 38:45.198
You want to get him out?

38:45.312 --> 38:46.447
HUNTLEY: Yeah, ideally.

38:46.879 --> 38:49.075
Assume the place is wired--
cameras, the whole bit.

38:49.627 --> 38:52.315
- When would you want this done?
HUNTLEY: - As soon as possible.

38:52.420 --> 38:55.185
And we just want to take him long
enough to ask some questions.

38:56.156 --> 38:59.875
Won't be easy.
But I'll see what I can do.

39:00.196 --> 39:01.272
HUNTLEY: Thanks.

39:10.246 --> 39:13.668
GULICKSON: - I don't have good news.
PARSONS: - What's going on?

39:13.774 --> 39:16.210
GULICKSON: They've taken him to a
region I don't have access to.

39:16.311 --> 39:18.381
It's Taliban central.

39:18.472 --> 39:20.011
PARSONS: There's no one
else you can go to?

39:20.342 --> 39:22.688
GULICKSON: I've contacted the
military, the U.S. embassy--

39:22.783 --> 39:24.892
you know, none of them
have influence there.

39:27.324 --> 39:28.557
I'm sorry, Ellen.

39:28.682 --> 39:30.570
I-I don't...
I don't know what to do next.

39:33.212 --> 39:37.079
PARSONS: It's okay. I do.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.007
ERICKSON: This is a nice little spot.
My wife would've liked it.

39:46.977 --> 39:48.866
Get a scotch over here, please?

39:52.874 --> 39:54.990
Nice job at my deposition.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.343
You handled yourself very well.
You really got my guff.

39:59.842 --> 40:01.835
PARSONS: I'm not here to
banter, Mr. Erickson.

40:01.939 --> 40:04.897
You're a murderer, and Chris
Sanchez is next on your list.

40:06.377 --> 40:09.663
ERICKSON: Mr. Sanchez is one
of my most valued employees.

40:10.014 --> 40:12.775
PARSONS: He's also a
witness to your crimes.

40:13.460 --> 40:14.520
He's not the only
one, of course.

40:14.602 --> 40:16.322
There's also Gerald Boorman.

40:19.788 --> 40:21.280
You really screwed
up, Mr. Erickson.

40:21.373 --> 40:24.348
You should've thought twice before
you got into bed with the CIA.

40:25.348 --> 40:26.868
ERICKSON: Why is that?

40:28.308 --> 40:30.996
PARSONS: Because Boorman
has hung you out to dry.

40:31.434 --> 40:35.496
He's willing to give me everything
I need so I can win my case.

40:39.366 --> 40:44.839
He has proof that you sent your men
on an unauthorized operation.

40:45.034 --> 40:49.516
The mission that killed Rayburn, Franks
and Lowry wasn't officially sanctioned.

40:51.115 --> 40:55.310
ERICKSON: If he told you
that, then he's lying.

40:55.750 --> 41:00.795
PARSONS: I assume that he is.
And I don't care.

41:01.562 --> 41:04.561
Because those redacted documents
that you sent over to us--

41:04.659 --> 41:06.981
Boorman is getting
them unredacted.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.674
And once he's through, you'll
publicly be declared a traitor,

41:11.960 --> 41:16.579
High Star will be dissolved, and the
CIA will skate through unscathed.

41:25.537 --> 41:28.809
But your life does not
have to end in prison.

41:34.771 --> 41:37.245
I'll throw away everything
Boorman gives me.

41:37.360 --> 41:41.554
Everything.
I'll drop the case altogether.

41:42.408 --> 41:44.438
ERICKSON: In exchange for what?

41:45.160 --> 41:48.324
PARSONS: Bring Christopher
Sanchez home, alive.

41:48.440 --> 41:51.935
ERICKSON: This is quite a little
fairy tale you've concocted.

41:52.150 --> 41:54.370
But suppose, for the sake of argument,

41:54.463 --> 41:56.561
that I were unhappy with
one of my employees.

41:58.037 --> 42:02.036
If you were to drop the case,
wouldn't Patty Hewes just pick

42:02.127 --> 42:04.306
it up and keep coming
right after me?

42:04.825 --> 42:07.783
PARSONS: - I won't let her.
ERICKSON: - You won't let her?

42:07.876 --> 42:11.344
PARSONS: No, Mr. Erickson.
This is my case.

42:11.468 --> 42:15.387
Deliver me Sanchez, and
I'll make it all go away.

42:16.096 --> 42:20.094
ERICKSON: Ah... we could both use
a happy ending, Ms. Parsons.

42:20.583 --> 42:25.126
So you talk to Patty Hewes,
make sure she's on board,

42:25.983 --> 42:28.981
and maybe you and I will have
something to talk about.

43:09.472 --> 43:10.484
(door slams)

43:12.021 --> 43:12.966
(door closes)

43:27.215 --> 43:39.399
(pounding)

44:06.412 --> 44:07.752
I couldn't get to the kid.

44:07.852 --> 44:10.319
HUNTLEY: - What happened?
- Someone beat us to it.

44:17.107 --> 44:20.070
(thump)

44:25.936 --> 44:28.345
(footsteps approaching)

44:35.696 --> 44:36.966
ERICKSON: It's okay.

44:43.751 --> 44:45.508
I've got boys of my own.

44:45.810 --> 44:51.660
One of them's about your age.
I would never hurt you.

44:56.490 --> 44:58.423
Let's you and I
go have some fun.

45:22.132 --> 45:22.694
(cell phone ringing)

45:22.806 --> 45:23.969
(video game playing over TV)

45:24.784 --> 45:27.522
ERICKSON: - Hey there, Jerry.
BOORMAN: - You took him.

45:27.637 --> 45:32.083
ERICKSON: Yeah, I did.
Got him right here next to me.

45:36.103 --> 45:38.153
Imagine he's getting hungry.

45:39.297 --> 45:41.148
BOORMAN: What the
fuck are you doing?

45:41.247 --> 45:43.603
ERICKSON: Selling me out
to the lawyers, Jerry.

45:43.934 --> 45:46.123
BOORMAN: Who the hell
put that in your mind?

45:46.289 --> 45:50.558
ERICKSON: No, no, no, no, no.
Don't pull that shit.

45:50.796 --> 45:53.138
BOORMAN: - Howard!
ERICKSON: - I know who the kid is.

45:53.390 --> 45:56.855
Your asset was his mother.
He's not a terrorist.

45:56.987 --> 45:59.017
You didn't take him out
of there for information.

45:59.119 --> 46:03.637
You got three of my men killed
carrying out your personal business.

46:03.739 --> 46:05.539
BOORMAN: You don't know
what you're talking about.

46:05.707 --> 46:07.604
ERICKSON: And if you ever
want to see the kid again,

46:07.706 --> 46:10.124
you're gonna take the
fall for Dust Devil.

46:18.319 --> 46:20.554
(video game continues playing)

46:30.002 --> 46:34.286
HEWES: - This is a very big decision.
PARSONS: - I know.

46:34.733 --> 46:37.297
HEWES: A case like this
doesn't come along every day.

46:38.462 --> 46:43.090
PARSONS: I'm aware of that,
but Chris' life is in danger.

46:44.058 --> 46:45.641
HEWES: How do you know?

46:46.089 --> 46:48.957
PARSONS: I've been in contact
with Dean Gulickson.

46:50.780 --> 46:54.617
He found out that High Star is
going to have Chris killed.

46:58.076 --> 46:59.663
It's my fault.

47:01.512 --> 47:04.817
Dropping the case is the
only way to stop it.

47:08.142 --> 47:10.314
And I've spoken to Howard Erickson.

47:15.285 --> 47:17.863
I told him the CIA was
willing to give him up.

47:18.533 --> 47:22.284
Boorman was turning against him.
So I offered him a deal.

47:22.690 --> 47:25.739
I said I'd drop the case if
he brings Chris home safely.

47:28.368 --> 47:32.708
HEWES: - Did he agree to that?
PARSONS: - No.

47:33.434 --> 47:38.544
HEWES: - Why not?
PARSONS: - Because of you.

47:40.937 --> 47:46.047
He's worried that you'll pick up the
cause, pursue High Star without me.

47:47.878 --> 47:50.984
He needs assurance from you
that you won't, Patty.

47:54.039 --> 47:56.022
I need assurance from you.

48:15.585 --> 48:18.543
We have reached our
destination, Mr. Sanchez.

48:21.439 --> 48:23.487
SANCHEZ: Tell Howard Erickson...

48:24.423 --> 48:27.066
it was a pleasure
working for him.

48:30.321 --> 48:31.566
Take him.

48:33.148 --> 48:36.796
HEWES: Are you sure that you want
Howard Erickson to go unpunished?

48:38.452 --> 48:40.909
PARSONS: I don't have a choice.

48:45.926 --> 48:48.244
Chris' life is in my hands.

49:10.223 --> 49:11.945
HEWES: All right.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.401
(sighs softly)

49:15.891 --> 49:18.266
I'll stay away from the case.

49:20.530 --> 49:22.260
PARSONS: Thank you.
