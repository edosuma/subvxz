WEBVTT

00:25.650 --> 00:27.930
You definitely did it?
No.

00:27.970 --> 00:30.170
I left without making a transaction.
I'll rely on prayer.

00:30.210 --> 00:32.610
Of course I did it.
Everything OK your end?

00:32.650 --> 00:34.250
Yeah. Sally fell for it.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.050
I said triple-booking
the meeting room would work.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.090
It was mayhem in there.
(OVERLAPPING VOICES)

00:39.130 --> 00:44.090
It's ridiculous. I don't know
how it happened. It's a mess.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.410
And no-one saw you
at the Internet cafe?

00:46.450 --> 00:48.850
No, I was careful.

00:56.170 --> 00:58.290
Alfie's asking for you.
He's losing it.

00:58.330 --> 01:01.450
I'm head of accounts. It
isn't my job to sort this shit out.

01:01.490 --> 01:04.970
The whole office is in there.
It's really kicking off. Shit!

01:06.930 --> 01:08.930
Sorry, Sally.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.490
508906.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.530
906.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.570
50,000.

01:31.970 --> 01:35.290
Oh, get it out. I want to see
what 50 grand looks like.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.490
There you go.
It's less exciting than I thought.

01:41.530 --> 01:44.650
It's amazing to think that that's
what's gonna give us a baby.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.770
I have to go
through the ordeal of IVF,

01:46.810 --> 01:50.250
a pregnancy and you're one squirt
from being done, but yes, sure.

01:50.290 --> 01:54.530
We fucking did it, Deacon. £50,000.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.530
1.2 million.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.130
Fuck you, Alfie!

02:15.610 --> 02:18.610
There is something I need to tell
you. If it's a speech about

02:18.650 --> 02:21.010
how we can only spend
the money on IVF, I know.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.250
But fuck, we did it!
Celebrate for once. Fuck!

02:25.290 --> 02:28.290
Wa-hoo! Fuck! Yeah!

02:28.330 --> 02:30.090
Go on. It feels amazing.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.290
Fuck!
Yeah!

02:33.330 --> 02:35.490
Whoa! Fuck! Shit!

02:35.530 --> 02:38.050
Yeah, I've got money, bitch.

02:38.090 --> 02:42.410
(LAUGHS) Alright, let's go home and
have rich people sex.Absolutely.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.610
Can I wear my hoodie while we're
doing it? Absolutely not.

02:50.490 --> 02:53.490
Why can we never get a shitting
parking space on our street?

02:53.530 --> 02:56.810
OK. Here's one.

02:56.850 --> 02:59.170
No, you're not gonna fit in there.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.570
Really?
Really.

03:01.610 --> 03:05.530
Prepare to find me incredibly sexy.

03:08.770 --> 03:15.010
It's just about taking it slow,
but turning it hard.

03:15.050 --> 03:19.410
Before I get so incredibly turned
on again, I have a surprise for you.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.450
Yeah, what is it?
Ta-da!

03:22.490 --> 03:25.050
What the hell is that?
Do I actually have to tell you?

03:25.090 --> 03:27.330
We agreed to be careful.
We talked about it.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.050
You told me
to stop going on about it,

03:29.090 --> 03:30.890
because my whining was
making your vagina hate me.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.930
It was. But our plan worked, Deacon.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.850
We have £50,000
sitting in an account

03:34.890 --> 03:37.770
or whatever crypto shit
is on that USB.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.930
No-one knows the money's gone.
Just enjoy.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.890
No, no. Not just enjoy,
OK, Allison.

03:42.930 --> 03:45.210
This is when people
get cocky and get caught.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.290
What people? Well, it's working
in Goodfellas, OK?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.770
But the point still stands, alright?
It's not good.

03:51.810 --> 03:54.930
It's one bottle of champagne to
celebrate the start of our family.

03:54.970 --> 03:59.290
This is our dream.
Yeah, OK. I know. Fine!

04:02.170 --> 04:04.210
OK, because of this
"just enjoy" chat,

04:04.250 --> 04:06.610
I'm gonna have to start
this all over again. Thank you.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.410
Does that parking thing
mean you won't have sex with me?

04:09.450 --> 04:13.050
Yeah, I will.
I'll just respect you less.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.690
I told you we should have champagne
flutes, because you never know.

04:15.730 --> 04:18.250
It's gonna taste
the same out of a beaker. Hey, guys!

04:18.290 --> 04:20.930
Esme.
I wondered where you were.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.690
You're back. I thought
you were at a festival.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.970
Oh, this is Jed. Say hi, Jed.

04:25.010 --> 04:27.770
What's good?
Hello.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.570
A magic thing happened.
I was at this lame ska tent.

04:30.610 --> 04:37.050
I desperately needed a pee
and Jed lent me his pint glass. Ew!

04:37.090 --> 04:39.610
It was a real meet cute.
A cool story that ends up with you

04:39.650 --> 04:42.250
and a stranger in our living room.
We're glad to have you back, Es.

04:42.290 --> 04:45.570
Sure? I can leave you guys to it.
We're just getting a takeaway.

04:45.610 --> 04:49.250
It's no biggie, is it, Deacon?
What? Oh, no. No biggie at all.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.490
So great to have you.
We've nothing going on.

04:51.530 --> 04:55.330
Great. Are you celebrating?
Well, no. No, we're not. No.

04:55.370 --> 04:57.250
Then why the champagne?
It's Prosecco.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.370
No, it is champagne, actually.

04:59.410 --> 05:02.330
What are you celebrating?

05:02.370 --> 05:06.610
Well, we're...
well, should I just say?

05:06.650 --> 05:07.850
Yeah.
We're pregnant.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.770
What?
No.No, we're not.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.930
No, we're not. That is
an insane thing to make up.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.450
We got paid our bonuses
that we were promised.

05:14.490 --> 05:18.130
Oh! That's sick, man.
Thanks, man. That is sick.

05:18.170 --> 05:19.650
Why were you trying to hide that?

05:19.690 --> 05:23.210
Because he's freaking out that
if he tells people, it'll jinx it.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.130
He's a dick. Such a dick.
An absolute villain. (LAUGHS)

05:27.170 --> 05:29.090
Celebratory joint?

05:32.570 --> 05:34.170
You know they gave us a joint

05:34.210 --> 05:36.770
so they could bang
in the living room? 100%.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.810
Think they'll have
champagne at the fancy IVF clinic?

05:39.850 --> 05:41.350
They should for what it costs.

05:43.690 --> 05:46.450
Think you should be drinking?
I'm about to start IVF again.

05:46.490 --> 05:48.170
When that happens, I won't drink,

05:48.210 --> 05:52.930
so I intend on being drunk
pretty much until that moment.

05:52.970 --> 05:56.290
I know we're celebrating,
but I do feel quite nervous.

05:56.330 --> 05:59.650
This clinic
basically guarantees success.

05:59.690 --> 06:05.650
It will be worth it? After all
we've been through, it has to be.

06:05.690 --> 06:07.410
(FLATLINE SIGNAL)

06:07.450 --> 06:09.490
It's not fair.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.250
We had a heartbeat.

06:11.290 --> 06:13.290
I'm so sorry, Al.

06:18.770 --> 06:25.010
You're right. We can't let
this be our last chance.

06:27.850 --> 06:31.530
Yeah? Yes. Yeah.
No, you're right. You're right.

06:31.570 --> 06:34.610
You know, this could be
the beginning of everything.

06:34.650 --> 06:39.450
It's amazing! Know what's amazing?
£50,000 in our bank account.

06:39.490 --> 06:42.890
Well, it's bitcoin. So it's
in an offline digital wallet.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.850
You've made 50 grand sound unsexy.

06:45.890 --> 06:49.090
I'm starting to feel guilty again
when I think about what we've done.

06:49.130 --> 06:54.490
We've fucking robbed our boss, Al.
Chill out. That man is a prick.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.450
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.930
I'm sorry we had to do it
in a cab but, you know,

06:58.970 --> 07:01.130
a worker's job's never done.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.330
Is the Oasis Spa and Massage Centre
on Cannon Road, mate?

07:04.370 --> 07:07.410
Yes, mate. Back's fucked.

07:07.450 --> 07:10.890
Plus it's only a tenner
for a happy ending.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.170
It's about that bonus.
Let me stop you there.

07:13.210 --> 07:17.290
I know where you're going with this.
You're gonna say, and you're right,

07:17.330 --> 07:22.330
I don't praise you enough. It's
about the bonuses you promised us.

07:22.370 --> 07:26.130
Deac, you are crushing it
right now, OK? Happy?

07:26.170 --> 07:28.250
Yes. OK, thank you.
A nice chat.

07:28.290 --> 07:31.290
Gonna get out, because we're
getting further from the office.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.170
Alfie, we've talked about it
for ages,

07:33.210 --> 07:35.970
but Allison
and I really do need our bonuses.

07:36.010 --> 07:38.610
Yeah. And I was thinking the same.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.650
Really?
Really.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.650
So, I got this for you guys.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.010
64 gigs.

07:46.050 --> 07:49.330
That's 32 each. Thank me
later for saving your marriage.

07:49.370 --> 07:52.970
Alfie, we need money. I'd love to
help you out, wouldn't I?

07:53.010 --> 07:55.210
But you know how
the property market is.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.090
We don't have money lying around.

07:57.130 --> 08:00.970
All our money is sunk into
investments your lovely wife found.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.570
Look, I promise you,
once the market picks up,

08:03.610 --> 08:07.850
I'll see you both right, right?

08:08.890 --> 08:13.650
OK.Fucking hell, this is awkward.
Look, are you gonna get out here,

08:13.690 --> 08:19.170
because I can't be thinking about
this when I'm getting a handjob.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.570
(TEXT ALERT)

08:21.610 --> 08:23.930
Oh, shit, it's Alfie.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.690
What if Sally's seen the transfer
and told him?

08:25.730 --> 08:28.450
Sally can't even operate
the meeting room booking calendar.

08:28.490 --> 08:33.330
She'll never see it. Stop worrying.
Yeah, you're right.

08:33.370 --> 08:35.890
VOICEMAIL: We need to talk.

08:35.930 --> 08:37.530
We're fucked!

08:40.770 --> 08:42.770
Alright, so you're gonna be cool.
Uh-huh.

08:42.810 --> 08:46.490
You're gonna be calm. A regular day.
Let's go.

08:46.530 --> 08:50.050
I can do this.
We can do this. Just relax.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.290
We talk normally
and everybody will be chill.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.810
You don't have to tell me.

08:53.850 --> 08:56.010
Shit! What if he knows?

08:56.050 --> 08:59.250
What if we walk in and he actually
fucking knows? Jesus Christ!

08:59.290 --> 09:02.010
He knows you stole the money and he
wants to address it in office hours.

09:02.050 --> 09:05.210
This is unbearable.
Don't worry. Relax. He can't know.

09:05.250 --> 09:08.690
He might not know now, but he
can literally find out any minute.

09:08.730 --> 09:12.690
Ssh. Ssh. Chill the fuck out.
Yeah, OK. Yeah, sure. Thank you.

09:18.850 --> 09:23.530
It's not terrible,
but it's not ideal.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.570
What have you done?

09:32.610 --> 09:35.650
What do you mean?

09:35.690 --> 09:37.970
Oh, well, it's yogurt.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.210
I'd soak it.
Yeah, thanks.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.090
Sally, just out of curiosity,

09:43.130 --> 09:46.130
how has Alfie been kind of mood-wise
and shit?

09:46.170 --> 09:47.690
Oh, he's fine, I think.

09:47.730 --> 09:49.970
(SHOUTING)

09:50.010 --> 09:51.690
Was it the same fine?

09:51.730 --> 09:55.410
What?
Pick it up. Pick it up!

09:55.450 --> 09:58.690
Oh, no, you're right.
I actually hadn't seen him today.

09:58.730 --> 10:01.450
Thank you so much, Sally.
Am I speaking to myself here?

10:01.490 --> 10:06.170
You're the reason I blow 50 quid
a week on fucking garbage dumped.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.370
I've had enough of your stupid face.

10:08.410 --> 10:12.410
Get out of me office
and go get him for me.

10:12.450 --> 10:19.290
Um, Deacon, sorry to bother you, but
Alfie would just love a quick word.

10:19.330 --> 10:22.410
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.
Did he say what it was about,

10:22.450 --> 10:25.250
because I've got
a couple of things... Now!

10:25.290 --> 10:28.010
Yeah, but these can probably wait.
Thanks, mate.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.530
(LIGHT KNOCK)

11:03.330 --> 11:05.330
Um, I can come back.

11:18.850 --> 11:20.530
You're looking well.

11:20.570 --> 11:22.490
What do you mean?
What do I mean?

11:22.530 --> 11:24.970
I said, "You're looking well."
Really? Thanks.

11:25.010 --> 11:29.370
I'm trying to be a bit healthier,
eating a low fat...

11:29.410 --> 11:31.690
Do you care about this company?

11:31.730 --> 11:34.770
Yeah, of course I do. Yeah, yeah.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.330
Would it matter to you
if it all went tits up?

11:37.370 --> 11:42.770
Yeah, I'd be really upset. I'd be
so ups... I'd be devastated.

11:42.810 --> 11:44.850
Know I set this company up
from nowt?

11:44.890 --> 11:47.810
Nobody handed it me
on a silver fucking platter.

11:47.850 --> 11:50.810
I mean, of course, if I could
have fucked my way to the top

11:50.850 --> 11:55.210
I would in a heartbeat,
but I'm like you.

11:57.690 --> 12:00.850
This body is no bargaining tool.

12:00.890 --> 12:04.930
So, what I did, I rolled up
my sleeves and I buried them in shit

12:04.970 --> 12:08.130
and I pulled out
every opportunity coming to me.

12:08.170 --> 12:15.130
And if anybody ever tried to do
anything to this company,

12:15.170 --> 12:17.210
you know what I'd do to them?
No.

12:17.250 --> 12:21.610
I'd rip their fucking throats out
and shit down their necks!

12:21.650 --> 12:25.090
Alfie, I don't know what exactly
this refers to, but...

12:25.130 --> 12:31.370
Is it possible to spend 132 quid
on Wagon Wheels?

12:31.410 --> 12:36.530
Um, yeah, I mean, I suppose it's
possible if you sort of...

12:36.570 --> 12:38.850
Everyone think I'm a soft touch?
Doubt it.

12:38.890 --> 12:44.210
Then why are we spending £132
on Wagon Wheels? I don't know.

12:44.250 --> 12:48.770
I think it might be because
Sally's quite, you know, nice.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.450
Like, she's sort of quite agreeable.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.490
And so, when people are putting
in the expenses claims

12:54.530 --> 12:57.010
and the snack orders,
I think maybe, you know,

12:57.050 --> 13:00.330
they take the piss a bit, I think.
That would be my best guess.

13:00.370 --> 13:05.170
You know what? For once,
you might actually be right.

13:05.210 --> 13:08.050
(SIGHS)

13:08.090 --> 13:09.610
I need to fire Sally.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.570
Hurry up!

13:17.610 --> 13:20.370
What is the emergency? Oh, my God!

13:20.410 --> 13:22.330
I'm gonna be late for the clinic.

13:22.370 --> 13:24.930
So, I talked to Alfie. Christ!
Does he know the money's missing?

13:24.970 --> 13:28.050
No.Great. Why do you have that
"I came too quickly" expression?

13:28.090 --> 13:30.570
Well, I may have talked him
into firing Sally.

13:30.610 --> 13:34.090
How the fuck did you do that? It was
an accident. I said she was nice.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.570
Realise if Sally goes
they might bring in an accountant

13:36.610 --> 13:39.890
capable of spotting what we've done?
No, that hadn't occurred to me.

13:39.930 --> 13:42.250
I'm having a panic about Strictly.

13:42.290 --> 13:45.010
So, what did you do?
I agreed and got the fuck out.

13:45.050 --> 13:48.090
This is too much, alright?
We need to put the money back.

13:48.130 --> 13:50.610
It's too much.No.
It's like an allergic reaction

13:50.650 --> 13:53.330
and I'm gonna cry. We're not putting
the money back. That is mental.

13:53.370 --> 13:54.770
What if they spot it going in?

13:54.810 --> 13:57.970
Think they just won't look further?
Oh, God, you're right.

13:58.010 --> 14:00.690
We did this for a family.
We can't back out now.

14:00.730 --> 14:03.210
You need to convince Alfie
not to fire Sally.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.370
I don't
want to raise our baby in prison.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.970
Though some babies
look cute in orange. Gotta go.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.450
You're going?
I cannot be trusted to handle this.

14:10.490 --> 14:12.650
Allison? Allison?

14:22.090 --> 14:24.090
(DOOR OPENS)

14:24.130 --> 14:29.570
So, your previous attempts have
been NHS, is that correct? Yes.

14:29.610 --> 14:31.610
Did they tell you
your hormone level

14:31.650 --> 14:34.010
and how that
affected your chances of conceiving?

14:34.050 --> 14:37.850
I think they said
we had like a 30% chance.

14:37.890 --> 14:40.250
Right.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.770
Well, you don't have to
sugar-coat it. It's OK.

14:42.810 --> 14:47.410
Just give it to me straight.
I'm very difficult to upset.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.770
Well, your ovarian reserve is low.

14:49.810 --> 14:52.330
Every month that ticks by
it will get worse.

14:52.370 --> 14:56.250
To be honest, you'd be lucky to get
one or two eggs from the retrieval

14:56.290 --> 15:01.530
and, even then, your eggs
will be of questionable quality.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.690
(TEARFUL) Yeah.
See how that did not upset me?

15:07.730 --> 15:12.690
If you have the funds, we have
a range of services that can help.

15:12.730 --> 15:16.050
Though I do need to warn you,
once you have the first injection,

15:16.090 --> 15:18.970
you are committed to the full
set of fees we sent you,

15:19.010 --> 15:22.690
despite the low chance of success.

15:22.730 --> 15:26.370
(SIGHS) Let's do it.

15:27.730 --> 15:32.170
Why are we spending
hundreds of pounds on paper?

15:32.210 --> 15:34.610
It's probably
because we're an office

15:34.650 --> 15:36.650
and we need stationery.

15:36.690 --> 15:41.250
Yeah. That makes sense, actually.

15:41.290 --> 15:42.530
What do you want?

15:42.570 --> 15:47.250
Oh, well, I was thinking about our
conversation about Sally earlier.

15:47.290 --> 15:50.690
Yeah, what about it? I was just
thinking that maybe you need to

15:50.730 --> 15:53.850
just sort of just relax a bit.

15:53.890 --> 15:57.330
You know, like, you know,
things probably aren't as bad

15:57.370 --> 16:03.170
as you think and, you know,
you maybe just need to chill.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.570
For fuck's sake,
if you want to go for a drink

16:05.610 --> 16:07.610
after work, then just say so.

16:07.650 --> 16:09.090
What?

16:09.130 --> 16:12.090
OK. But I choose the venue.
8pm, Bar Zero.

16:12.130 --> 16:15.970
You are absolutely right.
We need to get shit-faced.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.970
So, how did it go?
Great. I had my first injection.

16:26.010 --> 16:29.970
Did he say it was all looking good?
What did he say our chances are?

16:30.010 --> 16:32.610
Great. They're the best
in the business. It's fine.

16:32.650 --> 16:36.650
It's very exciting, isn't it?
It's a little bit teary.

16:36.690 --> 16:39.130
It's kind of our next chapter.

16:39.170 --> 16:43.330
I'm also quite angry with you,
because thanks to you,

16:43.370 --> 16:45.610
I have to
spend the evening with Alfie,

16:45.650 --> 16:48.770
to talk him out of firing Sally.
So...

16:48.810 --> 16:52.010
thank you and... fuck you!

16:55.690 --> 16:57.890
(MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND)

16:57.930 --> 17:01.890
What can I get you?
I'm OK for the minute, thank you.

17:01.930 --> 17:05.210
What? Are you taking the piss?
We'll have a bottle of vodka.

17:05.250 --> 17:08.250
Alfie,
vodka is £300 a bottle here, mate.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.330
Oh, what are we gonna do?

17:10.370 --> 17:14.570
Bring us two bottles, yeah,
and a nappy for baby boy here.

17:14.610 --> 17:17.170
Alfie, I can't
afford £300 for a bottle of vodka.

17:17.210 --> 17:22.050
It's on me, as in on the company.

17:22.090 --> 17:24.610
Yeah. No, I got that.
I thought money was tight.

17:24.650 --> 17:27.690
Well, it is.
But this is a legitimate expense.

17:27.730 --> 17:29.370
Well, unlike Wagon Wheels?

17:29.410 --> 17:32.370
Are you trying to be smart?
What? No, no.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.850
You've got something
you want to tell me?

17:34.890 --> 17:37.930
No. No, not at all. No.

17:37.970 --> 17:42.050
Right. Well, then,
let's get bladdered, yeah?

17:42.090 --> 17:44.850
I started at lunchtime,
so you've got catching up to do.

17:44.890 --> 17:48.530
Alfie, there was actually one thing
about Sally. Oh, here we go.

17:48.570 --> 17:51.410
I was thinking that
firing Sally isn't the best idea.

17:51.450 --> 17:56.010
Why? Well, it's just you don't
exactly play by the rules yourself.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.130
What?
Well, it's just that, you know...

17:58.170 --> 18:02.930
No, I don't know.
Calm down, pussy boy.

18:02.970 --> 18:06.170
I'm not gonna fire Sally.
Oh, thank God!

18:06.210 --> 18:10.610
I have sacked
that Wagon Wheeling cunt in HR.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.370
He cried a bit.

18:13.410 --> 18:17.290
This is fun. Just me and you
getting boozed up at home.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.850
It reminds me of being a kid.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.970
Esme, you drank both those bottles,
but this is fun.

18:22.010 --> 18:24.890
Why do you look worried? Shouldn't
we be celebrating your bonuses?

18:24.930 --> 18:26.810
Deacon's not one for celebrating.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.570
That's why I tell you
sisters are better than husbands.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.090
And by sisters, I mean me.
Yeah, I got that.

18:32.130 --> 18:34.650
Deacon's
worried about the whole IVF process

18:34.690 --> 18:37.170
and he's been looking after me.
It's really sweet.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.690
You mean a man controlling your
money and your womb. Totes sweet.

18:40.730 --> 18:45.250
Well, if you believe our new doctor,
my womb is barely worth controlling.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.570
God, really? He was brutal
about our chances of conceiving.

18:48.610 --> 18:51.730
What did Deacon say?
Oh, no, I can't tell him.

18:51.770 --> 18:53.490
We've done all this to get a baby

18:53.530 --> 18:56.690
and my body might be
the thing that fucks it up.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.850
What do you mean "all this"?

18:59.890 --> 19:02.690
We're not Bonnie and Clyde,
Allison. We can't do this.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.490
Let's just save up
and try a cheaper clinic.

19:04.530 --> 19:06.090
That clinic
was above a Chinese takeaway.

19:06.130 --> 19:09.690
If you like your insemination with
spring rolls, it's brilliant,

19:09.730 --> 19:13.410
but we're running out of time.
We have to go to that posh clinic.

19:13.450 --> 19:17.650
Maybe I can get one more loan
and get another round.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.890
Oh, no! What the fuck? Deacon,
we have more chance of getting money

19:21.930 --> 19:24.010
from one of those
Nigerian Prince emails.

19:24.050 --> 19:26.650
You said so yourself.
He doesn't know the accounts exist.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.450
Well, it doesn't matter.
We cannot do it, Al.

19:29.490 --> 19:33.370
Whatever happened to "You're right.
This cannot be our last chance"?

19:33.410 --> 19:37.730
(SIGHS) I knew
you'd hold that against me.

19:38.650 --> 19:40.410
Just going through our bonuses.

19:40.450 --> 19:43.850
I should be looking after you.
You're always looking after me.

19:43.890 --> 19:47.210
Apart from when you abandoned me
and moved to Berk-shire.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.690
You've been here six months, Es.
It's Berkshire.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.690
Anyway, let's have some fun,

19:51.730 --> 19:54.250
like before you shacked up
with Mr Sensible.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.010
What are you doing?

19:56.050 --> 20:00.410
Someone needs to engage in some very
non-complicated retail therapy

20:00.450 --> 20:03.530
because, one,
I think you need some fun, and two,

20:03.570 --> 20:06.090
it's your bonus and you can spend it
on what you like.

20:06.130 --> 20:09.010
And three, I cannot listen to you
moan for another second.

20:09.050 --> 20:12.850
Ah, I have always wanted one
like that.

20:12.890 --> 20:15.410
Do it. Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.770
Do it. Go on.
Oh, my God!

20:17.810 --> 20:20.850
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:20.890 --> 20:25.490
(SHOUTING)

20:27.690 --> 20:30.290
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Oh, God!

20:36.290 --> 20:38.290
(CHEERING)

20:41.770 --> 20:43.770
(PHONE RINGS)
Oh! It's Deacon.

20:44.690 --> 20:47.010
Have you lost your mind?
That's nice.

20:47.050 --> 20:49.330
Why am I getting alerts
from our credit card?

20:49.370 --> 20:52.650
Because you inappropriately set up
spending alerts on your phone.

20:52.690 --> 20:56.770
WOMAN: Oy, come back to the party.
We're playing Strip Twister.

20:56.810 --> 20:58.610
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec, mate.

20:58.650 --> 21:01.410
Listen, Allison,
the reason we did this was for IVF,

21:01.450 --> 21:03.570
not for bloody Prada handbags.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.770
Did you go back to Alfie's house
with a bunch of skanks?

21:06.810 --> 21:09.210
You know very well
I don't want to be with skanks

21:09.250 --> 21:11.330
and I'm doing what it takes.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.250
While you're at home online
shopping, I'm sent to prison.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.170
Don't be a drama queen,
it's just a handbag.

21:16.210 --> 21:19.930
Just a handbag?
It's £1,400, Allison.

21:19.970 --> 21:22.650
I hope it comes with 1,300 quid's
worth of cash inside it.

21:22.690 --> 21:26.290
Esme said you'd freak out. She's
fucking psychic, then, isn't she?

21:26.330 --> 21:30.050
Or just predicting how any sane
person would react in the situation.

21:30.090 --> 21:32.770
Are you calling me insane?
I'm not calling you insane.

21:32.810 --> 21:37.770
It's just fucking reckless, Allison.
You wear that bag into work,

21:37.810 --> 21:40.490
you might as well wear a sign
saying "Oh, hey Alfie.

21:40.530 --> 21:43.970
By the way,
I just robbed your company."

21:44.010 --> 21:46.010
Hello?

21:47.530 --> 21:49.530
