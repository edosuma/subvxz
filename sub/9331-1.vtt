00:05.636 --> 00:07.738
This is my
younger brother, Jake.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.181
Son of a bitch.

00:10.181 --> 00:12.713
You wanted to get rid of me
because you like her.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.685
Gabi, how can you
date my brother

00:14.685 --> 00:17.118
when three months ago,
I told you I loved you?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.750
Joshua, sometimes,
we have to be steady

00:19.750 --> 00:21.792
and give up the things
we want most.

00:21.792 --> 00:22.823
Even our dreams.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.427
All I ever wanted was
for you to be happy.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.667
Stop the truck.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.209
-What?
-Stop the truck!

00:41.542 --> 00:42.673
You okay?

00:44.175 --> 00:46.347
Jake, I'm sorry.

00:47.578 --> 00:48.779
Josh!

00:48.779 --> 00:50.721
I can't go.

00:51.822 --> 00:52.883
You need gas money?

00:52.883 --> 00:54.685
No.

00:54.685 --> 00:56.227
I mean, you fixing up the truck

00:56.227 --> 00:58.058
and sending me to Coachella.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.391
It's the most incredible,
thoughtful thing.

01:01.992 --> 01:03.834
I just want you
to be happy, Gabi.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.766
And I will be...

01:05.766 --> 01:06.897
now.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.401
Gabi!

01:12.072 --> 01:13.644
Whoa.

01:15.045 --> 01:16.977
Everything okay, daydreamer?

01:16.977 --> 01:19.480
Yeah. Yeah, totally okay.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.011
I'm just, um...

01:21.011 --> 01:23.083
-Tired?
-Yes.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.256
I mean, all that shopping
for food last night

01:25.256 --> 01:27.518
and then getting up
so early to leave.

01:28.619 --> 01:30.060
Hey, how much longer
to Coachella?

01:30.060 --> 01:33.464
Well, since the truck can
only go 40 miles an hour

01:33.464 --> 01:35.025
and we've been
on the road since seven,

01:35.025 --> 01:37.067
that means
we still have about...

01:38.369 --> 01:39.600
uh...

01:39.600 --> 01:42.373
-You don't have to do math.
-Whew!

01:42.373 --> 01:43.574
Thank you!

01:44.905 --> 01:46.537
So, um...

01:46.537 --> 01:48.739
how you feelin'?

01:48.739 --> 01:52.543
You know, about all this stuff.

01:52.543 --> 01:54.485
You mean our business stuff
or you and me stuff?

01:54.485 --> 01:55.646
All of it.

01:55.646 --> 01:57.888
A sick road trip with my girl,

01:57.888 --> 01:59.250
tons of cooking,

01:59.250 --> 02:00.691
awesome music festival.

02:00.691 --> 02:01.952
I feel pumped.

02:01.952 --> 02:04.295
-How are you feeling?
-Not conflicted.

02:05.396 --> 02:08.028
(bang, hiss)

02:08.028 --> 02:09.900
-Uh-oh.
-Ha ha...

02:09.900 --> 02:12.062
That is not a sign of anything.

-Hey, how bad is it?

02:39.290 --> 02:40.961
Two flat tires
and a broken radiator.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.092
-Oh.
-You call AAA?

02:42.092 --> 02:44.094
Yeah, they said
it's gonna be hours.

02:44.094 --> 02:45.636
Turns out people
heading to Coachella

02:45.636 --> 02:46.767
get in a lot of fender benders.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.469
From kissing?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.700
From brownies.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.202
Oh.

02:51.202 --> 02:52.343
That sign says

02:52.343 --> 02:54.345
we're five miles
from the town of Yermo,

02:54.345 --> 02:57.478
and do you know
what all small towns have?

02:57.478 --> 02:58.809
Carnivals?

02:58.809 --> 03:00.751
Garages.

03:00.751 --> 03:02.613
You wait here.
I'll go find one.

03:02.613 --> 03:04.315
Oh.

03:04.315 --> 03:06.016
You're my hero, Josh.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.260
Jake! I meant Jake.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.861
My mom does that too.

03:10.861 --> 03:13.694
(laughs)

03:13.694 --> 03:15.526
Moms are silly!

03:20.371 --> 03:21.632
(knocking)

03:22.773 --> 03:24.034
Josh, what are you doing here?

03:24.034 --> 03:25.636
Gabi...

03:27.578 --> 03:28.939
I had to come after you.

03:30.541 --> 03:32.383
I know this isn't
the right time to say it,

03:32.383 --> 03:34.214
but screw it 'cause
there's never gonna be
a right time.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.619
I was an idiot to let you
run away with Jake.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.191
I want to be with you.

03:42.393 --> 03:44.024
Seriously?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.326
I don't know what to say.

03:46.657 --> 03:47.858
Don't say anything.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.462
Mm...

03:51.462 --> 03:52.503
Yolanda:
Josh!

03:52.503 --> 03:53.534
Josh!

03:53.534 --> 03:54.535
Whoa.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.237
Whoa.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.670
You plan on buying
that pillow breakfast?

04:01.572 --> 04:03.844
Nothing sexual
was going on, Yolanda.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.776
I don't think that's
what the pillow would say!

04:07.278 --> 04:09.950
Ugh. Gabi...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.952
Oh, you got to be
damn kidding me.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.153
Is that what this is about?

04:13.153 --> 04:16.226
Her and Jake are
on their way to Coachella.

04:16.226 --> 04:18.258
Driving together,
working together...

04:18.258 --> 04:19.330
(scoffs)

04:19.330 --> 04:21.231
sleeping together--
How did this happen?

04:21.231 --> 04:22.693
How did this happen?

04:22.693 --> 04:24.935
They're driving to Coachella
because you sent them there.

04:24.935 --> 04:27.768
They're working together
because you bought 'em
a food truck.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.901
And they're sleeping together
'cause your brother is fine!

04:32.603 --> 04:34.305
-You made this happen.
-(scoffs)

04:34.305 --> 04:36.607
I was being magnanimous!

04:36.607 --> 04:37.808
What I really wanted was

04:37.808 --> 04:39.009
for her to jump off
the food truck

04:39.009 --> 04:40.050
and run back to me.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.653
Aw. Baby, I mean this
in the nicest way.

04:42.653 --> 04:43.954
Get over it.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.988
Get up, get you some fresh air,
and go on a bike ride.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.661
You made your bed,
now stop making out with it.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.833
Oh! Back from
the honeymoon already.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.104
What's the matter?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.506
Alan saw you naked?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.339
-On the plane.
-(giggles)

05:09.680 --> 05:12.383
We had one glorious night
in Puerto Vallarta,

05:12.383 --> 05:14.515
but there was a 30% chance
of a hurricane,

05:14.515 --> 05:16.286
which is 100%
too much for a Jew.

05:17.448 --> 05:19.119
But...

05:19.119 --> 05:22.923
we did manage to bring a little
Puerto Vallarta back with us.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.559
Oh, my damn.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.101
Alan loves it.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.664
-You do?
-I do.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.366
He's my little abacus.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.909
I'm gonna go look at it
again in the mirror.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.712
Hurry back, gorgeous!

05:43.914 --> 05:46.116
Oh, my God,
that hair is hideous.

05:46.116 --> 05:48.178
He doesn't have
a Halle Berry face
to pull that off!

05:48.178 --> 05:49.880
So why did you tell him
that you loved it?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.852
'Cause we just got married!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.353
I don't want to rock
our perfect boat

05:53.353 --> 05:56.226
by telling him he looks like
an Asian 2001 Justin Timberlake.

05:57.388 --> 05:58.629
Help me, Yolanda.

05:58.629 --> 06:01.532
Me help you figure out a way
to tell Elliot he's ugly?

06:01.532 --> 06:03.363
(laughs)
I'm in!

06:07.498 --> 06:08.739
(ringing)

06:10.340 --> 06:12.242
-Hey.
-Hey!

06:12.242 --> 06:13.373
Ooh.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.905
What's going on
in our apartment?

06:14.905 --> 06:18.378
Well, Dmitri's remodeling
Yolanda's place,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.411
so we're getting
all her old big appliances.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.683
They didn't fit over there,

06:22.683 --> 06:24.354
so they moved
the kitchen over here.

06:25.716 --> 06:28.358
(gasps)
A newish kitchen?

06:28.358 --> 06:29.720
Why aren't you more excited?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.062
Well, uh...

06:32.062 --> 06:34.224
I made out with Ruben
at the wedding

06:34.224 --> 06:36.867
and he said he could
really see a future...

06:36.867 --> 06:38.729
with his girlfriend, Chelsea.

06:38.729 --> 06:40.701
Oh.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.903
That is not your name.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.174
I'm sorry.

06:45.235 --> 06:47.438
What's going on
with me, you ask?

06:47.438 --> 06:49.009
Oh, nothing really.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.611
Just stalled on the side
of the road

06:50.611 --> 06:52.783
near some place
called Yermo.

06:52.783 --> 06:55.085
Jake went to go get help
and I'm here all alone

06:55.085 --> 06:57.818
and I'm worried
'cause I may have had
a fantasy about Josh.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.089
What?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.953
(sighs)
Help me, Sofia.

07:02.953 --> 07:05.425
I really can't stop thinking
about what Josh did for me.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.760
It was so sweet and loving
and confident and sexy and...

07:09.760 --> 07:11.401
I really like all those things!

07:12.903 --> 07:14.465
Oh, my God!

07:14.465 --> 07:16.937
Gabi, listen to me
very carefully.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.109
Let's just look at the facts.

07:20.110 --> 07:22.142
Josh bought you a food truck

07:22.142 --> 07:23.814
and sent you off
with his brother.

07:23.814 --> 07:25.145
Fact or not fact?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.177
Fact.

07:27.177 --> 07:31.251
And when you left,
you really liked Jake.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.023
Fact or not fact?

07:33.023 --> 07:34.685
Fact.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.456
Okay, so what's my point here?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.388
That I'm totally fact?

07:41.191 --> 07:42.733
I mean, it's natural for me

07:42.733 --> 07:44.134
to still have feelings
about Josh.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.897
We've been in a weird
yet beautiful non-relationship

07:46.897 --> 07:48.298
for over a year.

07:48.298 --> 07:51.101
But Jake is so charming
and so into me,

07:51.101 --> 07:54.474
and as you pointed out,
Josh did send me away with him.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.578
I just gotta get Josh
out of my head once and for--

07:57.578 --> 07:58.749
Gabi?

07:58.749 --> 07:59.850
Hello?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.653
-I'm in her head.
-Oh!

08:03.814 --> 08:05.455
Josh! What are you--

08:05.455 --> 08:07.217
what are you doing here?

08:07.217 --> 08:08.819
I was riding my bike
back and forth

08:08.819 --> 08:10.020
in front of
your apartment building,

08:10.020 --> 08:11.261
and I realized
that was pathetic.

08:11.261 --> 08:12.523
So, I decided to come up here

08:12.523 --> 08:13.924
and press my cheek
against the door.

08:15.566 --> 08:17.968
And I'm glad I did,
because now I know

08:17.968 --> 08:19.499
I'm in her head!

08:19.499 --> 08:21.802
Ugh, the two of you.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.535
She still has feelings for you,
you still have feelings for her.

08:24.535 --> 08:26.076
I can't take this anymore!

08:26.076 --> 08:27.377
Me neither.

08:27.377 --> 08:29.339
That's why I'm going after her
before Jake pushes me out

08:29.339 --> 08:30.941
of her head
with his Jakey charm.

08:30.941 --> 08:32.813
Yes! Go!

08:32.813 --> 08:35.546
Please put an end to this
once and for all!

08:35.546 --> 08:37.317
-You're coming with me.
-Me?

08:37.317 --> 08:38.488
Why do I have to go with you?

08:38.488 --> 08:39.820
Oh.

08:41.051 --> 08:44.024
Wanna take Lil So-So with you
as the enforcer?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.026
Keep you from wimping out
like you always do?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.928
I need two people
for the carpool lane.

08:49.159 --> 08:50.330
Or that. I'll go pack.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.736
(knocking)

08:55.736 --> 08:58.408
Elliot, can you get the door?

08:59.409 --> 09:00.841
Sure.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.813
You must be so tired
after your long day

09:02.813 --> 09:04.014
of cleaning up after no one.

09:08.318 --> 09:11.221
-Oh, my...
-I know.

09:12.322 --> 09:15.485
Your luxurious rows of corn
looked so amazing,

09:15.485 --> 09:16.727
I thought I'd get some too.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.888
You like?

09:17.888 --> 09:20.090
Uh... I don't like.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.193
I love!

09:24.264 --> 09:26.496
I should call you
Orville Redenbacher

09:26.496 --> 09:28.268
'cause that corn is poppin'!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.942
You hear that, Yolanda?
He loves!

09:33.103 --> 09:34.144
I don't get it.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.076
You look like a gay alien
from Predator.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.479
Oy, the clanking of the beads.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.281
I need to find
some migraine medication.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.915
Hurry back, my Caribbean queen.

09:46.556 --> 09:48.719
Oh, my God,
he looks horrendous.

09:48.719 --> 09:52.262
He doesn't have a Halle Berry
face like mine to pull it off.

09:52.262 --> 09:53.994
Halle Berry?

09:53.994 --> 09:55.626
More like Frankenberry.

10:01.071 --> 10:02.903
Man, I really hope this guy
knows what he's doing.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.776
Oh, relax, he's the number one
mechanic in Yermo.

10:05.776 --> 10:06.937
And the mayor.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.280
I've got good news and bad news.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.983
The bad news is
your radiator is shot.

10:12.983 --> 10:15.545
-Whats the good news?
-I'm about to make 450 bucks.

10:16.987 --> 10:20.350
Uh, kind sir, would you
perchance accept payment

10:20.350 --> 10:22.923
in the form of Brie
and chutney quesadillas?

10:24.554 --> 10:25.996
I do love Brie.

10:27.097 --> 10:28.258
But no.

10:29.599 --> 10:31.631
Jake, what are we gonna do?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.435
You think you can just kiss me

10:35.435 --> 10:36.937
and everything's gonna be
magically better?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.338
Mm...

10:38.338 --> 10:39.740
pretty much worked
my whole life.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.944
Jake, maybe this isn't
meant to be.

10:45.015 --> 10:46.616
You know, maybe
we should just go home.

10:46.616 --> 10:48.719
What are you talking about?

10:48.719 --> 10:51.922
This is all part
of the adventure.

10:51.922 --> 10:54.654
I know, but it's not
just about the truck.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.227
-There's been some stuff
going on in my head--
-No!

10:57.227 --> 11:00.590
No, no. This is happening.
We're doing it.

11:00.590 --> 11:03.163
Do you know how many
people with munchies

11:03.163 --> 11:04.995
are gonna pass this place
on the way to Coachella?

11:04.995 --> 11:07.337
We'll open the truck right here

11:07.337 --> 11:09.740
and sell your amazing food
to pay for the repairs.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.301
It's going to be awesome.

11:11.301 --> 11:12.602
Wow.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.745
You know, you're really sexy
when you take charge.

11:18.008 --> 11:19.409
Okay, that time,
it kind of worked.

11:21.251 --> 11:23.513
Sofia:
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

11:23.513 --> 11:24.985
(laughs)

11:26.416 --> 11:28.759
-Thanks for letting me drive.
This is so exci--
-Eyes on the road.

11:30.721 --> 11:32.322
All right, look,
we're almost in Yermo.

11:32.322 --> 11:35.295
-We still haven't seen them.
I mean, where are they?
-You should stop yelling, okay?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.267
It's not my fault
that Gabi's phone is dead

11:37.267 --> 11:40.000
and she's with Jake
and his beautiful
bee-stung lips.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.032
See? This is exactly my point.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.174
Girls can't resist him.
I've seen it my whole life.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.406
We gotta find them.

11:48.138 --> 11:49.780
(car decelerates)

11:49.780 --> 11:52.342
-Sofia, why are we slowing down?
-I don't-- I don't know.

11:52.342 --> 11:53.413
I'm flooring it!

11:57.217 --> 11:59.049
Sofia, we're out of gas!

11:59.049 --> 12:00.690
Why didn't you say something?

12:02.122 --> 12:05.525
Well, considering I don't
even have a driver's license,

12:05.525 --> 12:06.696
I think I'm doing pretty good.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.002
Okay, kids. All done.

12:12.002 --> 12:13.133
The truck's out back.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.705
And your quesadillas
were delicious.

12:15.705 --> 12:16.736
(laughs)

12:16.736 --> 12:18.408
Mm! Who knew I loved chutney?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.071
Anyway, you're good to...

12:21.071 --> 12:22.312
make out again.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.715
Can't really blame you.

12:25.715 --> 12:27.517
That is one
good-looking young man.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.349
(laughs)

12:29.349 --> 12:31.021
Thanks for everything, Joey.

12:31.021 --> 12:32.352
I love you, Jake.

12:35.225 --> 12:37.227
I have no idea
where that came from.

12:37.227 --> 12:39.689
I have a wife
and two lovely kids.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.191
You on Facebook?

12:41.191 --> 12:43.033
I'm gonna go
pull the truck around.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.234
Okay.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.168
Hey, Joey, how disgusting
is your bathroom?

12:48.168 --> 12:50.400
Not gonna lie. Pretty bad.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.405
(Sofia groans)

12:55.405 --> 12:56.947
Oh, thank God we made it.

12:58.248 --> 13:00.110
Okay, you get the gas. Sir?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.013
How disgusting
is your bathroom?

13:03.013 --> 13:05.515
Not gonna lie. Pretty bad.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.789
(loud music playing)

13:11.091 --> 13:12.092
(groans)

13:13.623 --> 13:14.624
(groans, coughs)

13:19.629 --> 13:20.630
(toilet flushes)

13:21.731 --> 13:23.433
Ew, ew, ew, ew!

13:35.745 --> 13:36.746
(toilet flushes)

13:53.063 --> 13:54.204
Josh?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.307
Oh, no, no, no, no!

13:57.307 --> 13:58.808
Gabi, no!

14:01.972 --> 14:04.214
Oh, these fantasies
have gotta stop.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.478
Come on, Sofia.

14:08.478 --> 14:11.221
-Let's walk back.
-Ugh, my feet hurt.

14:12.422 --> 14:13.823
No time to complain.

14:13.823 --> 14:16.356
Look, I've been too close
too many times, all right?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.988
I'm not letting
this chance pass me by.

14:19.429 --> 14:22.362
Okay, well, why don't we just
find out where they are first?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.134
-Call Jake.
-And say what?

14:24.134 --> 14:25.535
"Hey, Jake, where are ya?

14:25.535 --> 14:26.997
I want to steal
your girlfriend."

14:26.997 --> 14:29.369
Well, I wouldn't lead with that.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.741
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.

14:31.741 --> 14:33.373
Do you want to call him?
Call him.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.704
I don't want anything
to do with this.

14:34.704 --> 14:36.046
Put it on speaker.

14:37.777 --> 14:38.878
Man:
Hello?

14:38.878 --> 14:39.910
Jake? Is that you?

14:39.910 --> 14:41.111
I wish.

14:41.111 --> 14:42.452
That man is an Adonis.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.316
Um, why do you have
my brother's phone?

14:47.417 --> 14:48.989
Oh, Jake is your brother?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.422
Huh. I don't see it.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.695
Here. Your brother was
so busy making out

14:55.695 --> 14:56.896
with his girlfriend,
he left this.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.398
-They were here!
-They were making out?

14:59.529 --> 15:01.231
Uh, tell me something.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.934
Was the kiss super passionate
or was it that kind of kiss

15:03.934 --> 15:06.276
where you can tell the girl is
really into the guy's brother?

15:07.737 --> 15:09.539
I'd show you a picture,
but I cropped the girl out.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.482
That's it. We gotta go.

15:12.482 --> 15:14.844
Joey, lovely town,
disgusting bathroom.

15:16.786 --> 15:18.388
Tell Jake I say hi!

15:22.822 --> 15:23.994
-(rock music playing)
-Oh, my God!

15:23.994 --> 15:26.596
I can't believe we finally
made it to Coachella!

15:26.596 --> 15:29.099
Hey, this is Coachella, right?

15:29.099 --> 15:31.331
-Yeah!
-(laughs)

15:31.331 --> 15:34.534
Well, we're a day late,
450 bucks in the hole,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.466
we got the worst space
in the festival,

15:36.466 --> 15:38.208
but we made it!

15:38.208 --> 15:39.869
Yeah! Thanks to you!

15:39.869 --> 15:40.971
Thanks to us!

15:40.971 --> 15:43.343
I'm sorry that I'm yawning.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.245
Today's been really exciting

15:45.245 --> 15:46.916
and I guess it's just
kinda catching up to me.

15:46.916 --> 15:48.018
Say no more.

15:48.018 --> 15:49.349
I'm gonna grab the sleeping bag.

15:51.681 --> 15:55.055
Bag-a? Or bag-zzza?

15:56.826 --> 15:58.128
Thought we could share.
Is that cool?

15:59.589 --> 16:00.930
That's cool.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.662
And it should be cool.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.335
And I want it to be cool.

16:05.335 --> 16:06.596
But it's not cool yet.

16:06.596 --> 16:07.797
I get it.

16:08.898 --> 16:09.969
No, I don't.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.671
Okay.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.174
Do you remember when
we were leaving from the wedding

16:14.174 --> 16:16.206
and Josh gave us
this amazing food truck

16:16.206 --> 16:18.078
and he was so sweet
and he watched us drive away

16:18.078 --> 16:20.180
and I started thinking maybe
I still had feelings for him?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.252
Don't remember the last part.

16:22.252 --> 16:23.913
Yeah, that's the new part.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.258
Do you still have feelings
for my brother?

16:29.459 --> 16:30.490
I don't know.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.292
Ugh, what's wrong with me?

16:32.292 --> 16:34.164
Gabi, I get it.

16:35.325 --> 16:36.766
You and Josh have a history.

16:36.766 --> 16:39.299
But...

16:39.299 --> 16:40.800
you and I have a future.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.002
(sighs)

16:43.002 --> 16:45.135
Oh, my God,
that was so sexy.

16:45.135 --> 16:46.476
This is what's confusing me!

16:46.476 --> 16:48.838
Do you know what I do
when I'm confused
about something?

16:48.838 --> 16:49.879
What?

16:51.311 --> 16:52.342
Sleep on it.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.184
(sighs)
Sexy again.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.319
I wanted us to
have drinks together

16:59.319 --> 17:00.690
so you two would get drunk

17:00.690 --> 17:02.992
and finally tell
each other the truth.

17:02.992 --> 17:04.554
The truth about what?

17:04.554 --> 17:06.726
Your ugly-ass cornrows.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.360
Take it from someone
who's been there.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.532
You will never have
a good marriage by lying.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.105
Both:
We would never lie!

17:15.105 --> 17:16.536
Oh, yeah?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.139
Well, Elliot, Alan hates
your cornrows.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.870
-(gasps)
-But I only hate them

17:20.870 --> 17:22.412
'cause you look too handsome.

17:22.412 --> 17:25.145
-What?
-Look, I'm not George Clooney,

17:25.145 --> 17:28.078
and it makes me feel insecure
being married to such a hottie.

17:28.078 --> 17:30.420
Oh, hell no.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.283
Alan, Elliot hates
your cornrows too.

17:33.283 --> 17:34.454
(gasps)

17:34.454 --> 17:35.655
I'm sorry,

17:35.655 --> 17:38.388
but I already feel so insecure
being married to a 10.

17:38.388 --> 17:40.560
But with those cornrows...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.062
you're dialed up to a 12.

17:44.334 --> 17:45.565
I love you.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.666
I'll get rid of 'em tonight.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.999
So will I because I love you.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.000
(clanking)

17:52.372 --> 17:53.703
(laughs)

17:54.944 --> 17:56.576
Such a cute couple.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.778
(laughs)
See? I can lie too.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.313
Oh, I see the food truck.

18:03.313 --> 18:05.355
I still don't see
Gabi or Jake.

18:05.355 --> 18:06.656
Well, we've gotta find 'em.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.059
Found 'em.

18:11.621 --> 18:13.062
(sighs)
Dammit.

18:13.062 --> 18:15.265
I'm really sorry, Josh.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.128
I finally understand
why you didn't say anything

18:18.128 --> 18:19.629
all those other times before...

18:20.800 --> 18:24.774
because this is the most
uncomfortable feeling ever.

18:26.176 --> 18:28.308
Okay, let's just
get out of here

18:28.308 --> 18:29.639
and never talk about this ever.

18:32.482 --> 18:33.483
No.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.987
Okay, we can talk about it
a little bit in the car,

18:37.987 --> 18:39.689
but then never again.

18:41.751 --> 18:42.822
What are you doing?

18:42.822 --> 18:44.694
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

18:44.694 --> 18:45.725
Gabi.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.160
-Gabi.
-Josh?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.463
Oh, no, I'm having
that dream again.

18:53.463 --> 18:55.064
Josh?

18:55.064 --> 18:56.436
Uh, sorry I woke you up,

18:56.436 --> 18:57.967
but I really need
to talk to Gabi.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.340
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:02.712 --> 19:03.943
Here, take my jacket.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.921
Gabi, I drove all the way
out here to tell you something,

19:11.921 --> 19:14.123
and obviously I'm too late,

19:14.123 --> 19:16.125
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

19:18.127 --> 19:20.360
From the moment
you walked into my life,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.193
you have brought me
nothing but pain.

19:25.094 --> 19:27.697
This is a train wreck.

19:27.697 --> 19:30.540
Every day I have to look
at this beautiful, amazing,

19:30.540 --> 19:32.041
and funny woman
that I can't be with

19:32.041 --> 19:34.043
either because I screwed it up
or I lost my nerve

19:34.043 --> 19:35.144
or I didn't get to you in time

19:35.144 --> 19:36.746
because Sofia made us
run out of gas.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.885
Gabi...

19:45.885 --> 19:47.517
I'm crazy about you.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.821
I always have been.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.694
And I always will be.

20:00.370 --> 20:01.801
Well, um...

20:02.972 --> 20:04.003
Okay then.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.675
I'm gonna go. Uh...

20:05.675 --> 20:07.006
you two have a great night.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.408
Enjoy Coachella.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.310
You can just give
me the jacket back
when you guys get home, okay?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.741
Let's get out of here.

20:11.741 --> 20:12.782
Josh.

20:12.782 --> 20:14.284
Gabi, look, I didn't mean
to ruin your...

20:18.448 --> 20:19.889
You're not too late.

20:21.951 --> 20:23.653
-But didn't you and Jake...
-Nope!

20:26.796 --> 20:29.629
You've always been the one.

20:31.501 --> 20:34.704
♪ Tell me I'm a dreamer ♪

20:39.208 --> 20:41.140
So, uh, how are you doing?

20:43.212 --> 20:44.614
You okay?

20:44.614 --> 20:46.115
No.

20:47.477 --> 20:50.049
This trip did not turn out
how I expected.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.623
And on top of that,
I left my phone somewhere.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.725
Oh, my God.

20:55.725 --> 20:58.027
Get ready to be happy.

20:58.027 --> 20:59.859
Where did you find this?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.531
At the garage in Yermo.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.793
Oh! Sofia, so awesome.

21:05.194 --> 21:08.237
27 voicemails
from the same number?

21:09.439 --> 21:10.470
(beep)

21:10.470 --> 21:11.541
Joey:
Hey there, Jake.

21:11.541 --> 21:12.602
It's me, Joey, the mechanic.

21:15.104 --> 21:17.246
What's shakey, Beef-Jakey?

21:17.246 --> 21:19.449
-(both laugh)
-(beep)

21:19.449 --> 21:21.751
Guess what
I'm not wearing, Jake?

21:22.852 --> 21:23.853
Pants.
