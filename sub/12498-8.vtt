00:01.800 --> 00:04.000
after we're married,I want to adopt sam.

00:04.100 --> 00:07.100
I have to tell ray
that gavin goddard isn't sam's real father.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.900
- Nick deserves to know, hannah.
- Don't do this, eddie.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.100
Sam, I don't kw about the "father" of it all,
but I really love being your friend.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
Thanks.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.600
- You have to give me another chance.
- No, I don'T.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.000
My offer to work at cataldo builders still stands.

00:21.100 --> 00:24.300
Aubrey was acting all secretive,
all "I can't talk right now."

00:24.400 --> 00:25.400
I love you.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.800
Who was that call from?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.400
I'm not seeing anyone else.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.200
oh, yeah! That's gotta hurt, huh?!

00:37.300 --> 00:39.800
Die, tomato can, die! Yeah!

00:39.900 --> 00:45.000
Here we go. I have finally perfected a way to
make polenta with chocolate and cheddar cheese.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.300
Come on, guys. Can I play now?

00:46.400 --> 00:48.600
I have exactly six minutes
before I have to meet alison.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.200
It's my sunday with the kids.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.300
You guys aren't gonna believe this.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.500
Ronnie was right.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.700
There actually ar  different sizes of infinity?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.600
Aubrey's been cheating on me,
lying about it to my face.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.200
- What?
- Pause for a second.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.200
What? No. Not aubrey.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.800
I saw her last night.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.800
She wasn't in boston with the foo fighters.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.200
She was at that crappy motel 
with blue thunderbird dude.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.000
Well, I say we go over there, show him what's what.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.600
In fact, I say we start a club--
"the other men punishers."

01:16.700 --> 01:19.600
We go from town to town knocking
the snot out of other men.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.100
Wife cheating on you? Call O.M.P.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.900
- O.M.P.?
- Other men punisherS.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.500
I'm in.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.300
Okay. I'm outta here.
I'm gonna see what's up with aubrey.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.600
- Well, s-should we go after him?
- What, are you kidding?

01:30.900 --> 01:33.100
I'm almost the number one contender here, pal.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.300
- Bring it.
- Bring it, philly phil.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.500
Whoa.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.600
Well, hello there, missy.
what is zees?

01:46.600 --> 01:47.800
nothing.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.700
Just the dress that's been collecting dust
at the bottom of my hope chest,

01:51.800 --> 01:54.300
the dress that you'll never
get to see me wear in public...

01:54.400 --> 01:57.700
For it is the kind of dress one only wears to go..

01:57.900 --> 01:58.900
dancing.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.400
Oh! Not this again. I'm an old dog.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.400
I don't change my spots or--or whatever.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.000
I don't do the dancing thing.
It's all part of the package.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.900
So I've been told.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.500
But every month, I go out on a limb, and I think,

02:13.600 --> 02:18.600
maybe this is the month he'll take me
to ballroom madness at the V.F.W. Hall.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.700
Just a simple girl with simple dreams.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.400
That's me.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.900
I don't know how many times I gotta tell you--

02:26.100 --> 02:28.300
ballroom madness ain't all that mad.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
It's a bunch of old farts that are just...

02:30.400 --> 02:33.600
making a mockery of the great american songbook.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.600
Actually, it's the old farts who stay at home
and don't go dancing.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.700
I should know.
I just happen to be dating one of them.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.900
Gotta go.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.500
Got a lot of work to do.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.200
poppycock.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.000
Hey, nick. What ya doin'?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.800
Uh, nothin I'm just in a hurry.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.500
- Big window emergency?
- No.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.700
Then...where are you going?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.900
Uh, sam, I can't really talk right now.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.700
I'm gonna see you later, okay?

03:18.800 --> 03:21.800
please tell me this is going
in your downstairs bathroom.

03:21.900 --> 03:25.500
Actually, I have no idea where this is going.
What is this?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.600
A gift from ray.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.000
Hey, let me get another blanket.
I don't wanna scratch your floors.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.100
Thanks.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.300
- Look at you working for big cat.
- Yep.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.100
Surprises just keep comin'.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.700
You stick around long enough,
 you're gonna see everything.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.300
You should come for dinner on saturday.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.700
You, me, sam... ray.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.100
I don't know.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.700
Well, I know it's one thing to work for ray
and another to break bread with him, but...

03:58.800 --> 04:02.100
it's not that. Ray's been great.
I just don't wanna intrude.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.800
No. We would love to have you.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.100
all right. thanks.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.600
And I'm serious. Ray's been great.

04:15.700 --> 04:20.200
I mean, he's real generous and friendly,
and he's a pretty solid guy.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.399
Yeah.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.200
I mean, he told me he wants to adopt sam.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
He told you that?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
Yeah, and I thin it's a good idea-- 
give sam a real dad.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.500
You gonna say yes?

04:33.200 --> 04:37.400
I don't know. We were just talking about it...
with everyone, I guess.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.500
- daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.700
- Oh, hi, mr. Garrett.
- Oh, hello.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.300
um, could I--could i speak to you for a minute?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.900
- Um, sure.
- Okay.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.300
You guys wait here, okay?

04:58.400 --> 05:00.500
We're gonna have fun today.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.900
Are you a statue?

05:07.100 --> 05:09.700
- What is it?
- It's just...

05:10.600 --> 05:12.600
I don't really know what we're doing.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.118
I mean, I-I guess we're separated, 

05:14.387 --> 05:16.901
though we haven't officially
signed those papers or anything.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.544
- Alison--
- it's just, 

05:18.600 --> 05:20.401
something really weird happened the other day.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.000
What's that?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.700
I got asked out on a date.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.600
You did?

05:26.800 --> 05:30.300
I didn't know what to say--
what--what to do. I mean,

05:30.700 --> 05:31.800
have you been going on dates?

05:31.900 --> 05:35.300
Dates? I don'T...

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
yes.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.700
I've been going out on a lot of dates.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.500
- Really?
- Yeah. I have.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.400
So go. Definitely.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.500
Go on that date.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.500
All right. Guess I will.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.500
Bye.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.100
- Bye.
- Bye, guys. Love ya.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.000
Oh, man. You're old and crap?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.100
Yeah?

06:23.300 --> 06:26.200
That's the problem if you're born a while ago.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.800
You get to be old...and crap.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.300
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is she here?

06:33.400 --> 06:35.200
Who exactly are you referring to?

06:35.300 --> 06:38.200
Oh. Yeah. Let's play that game.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.100
- Who the hell are you anyway?
- Who the hell are you?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.900
I like to think of myself
as aubrey diaz's boyfriend.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.200
- Really?
- Who the hell are you?

06:46.300 --> 06:50.000
I like to think of myself as aubrey diaz's father.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.000
I didn't know aubrey had a boyfriend.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.700
- Yeah, I didn't know she had a father.
- See, I don't believe that.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.000
Well, I mean, I knew she had a father.
I just didn't know he ever... came around.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.900
He doesn't--not often. He's here now, though.

07:23.100 --> 07:27.800
Wants to make things right...with his little girl.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.800
And he may want to stop referring
to himself in the third person.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.400
Yeah, he may.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.800
And who are you, the firebrand?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.700
That touches my heart.

07:39.300 --> 07:43.100
Aubrey picked herself out a little firebrand, hmm?

07:43.300 --> 07:47.200
Well, it seems to me, you lost the right to have
your heart touched by her choices a long time ago.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.100
Ooh, indeed-Y. Now that--
that's a very, very firebrand thing to say to me.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.900
- You got a name, firebrand?
- Nick.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.500
Gabriel diaz.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.500
I'm glad you've come by, nick.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.700
I think I could use your help.

08:05.100 --> 08:08.000
- what for?
- With aubrey. What do you think?

08:08.200 --> 08:11.200
She come by here last night. What was that about?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.700
- Damn near run me out of town?
- She did?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.500
Good for her.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.500
Hey, whatever she told you about me--you know,
everything, all right? It's all true.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.500
I'm a liar. I'm a cheat.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.700
I'm a womanizer. I'm a gambler.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.700
I'm also a gentleman, and I'm an optimist, you know?

08:31.100 --> 08:33.799
I'm here to make peace, man. You understand?

08:33.900 --> 08:40.100
I wanna make peace with my baby girl,
whom I've neglected...

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
before it's too late.

08:43.799 --> 08:48.300
Listen, man, from what she told me
it was too late a while ago.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.900
What do you think? You know,
just because a guy wanders, you know,

08:51.000 --> 08:52.600
it doesn't mean you're lost.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.000
Okay. Yeah.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.800
I mean, come on. My own father--
I thought he was an astronaut till I was 13.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.000
Heavy-duty training at nasa is what they told me.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.500
You know, they think an astronaut
would beat out him being a drunkard,

09:03.600 --> 09:06.300
which, in the eyes of a little boy,
you know, I mean, he was.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.000
I see you learn from the best there.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.400
He didn't show up on my doorstep till I was 22.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.800
He showed up with a little
bottle of sweet cherry wine.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.100
Can you imagine that? Cherry wine.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.600
Loved the stuff.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.000
We sat down with it.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.100
By the time the bottle was empty, you know what?
We were good.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.300
I got it. I got it.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.500
I understood.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.000
I knew who he was, and he understood me.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.900
That's what I'm asking... from aubrey, you know?

09:36.800 --> 09:40.200
To drink a bottle of wine
and make everything all good? huh?

09:41.800 --> 09:44.600
I'll give it to ya-- you are an optimist.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.800
Why don't you get me an audience with my daughter?

09:46.900 --> 09:49.100
Maybe we can all win here.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.200
If alison's going on a date,
then I'm going on a date, too.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.500
Good for you. With who?

10:01.600 --> 10:06.000
Well, that's the problem.
I don't know.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.900
I have to find someone to date.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.100
How do I do that? The internet?

10:11.100 --> 10:15.200
Actually, I know someone you might like-- bethany.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.000
She's in my art class. Very cute. Earthy.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.800
I think I could set you two up.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.100
Be careful of earthy, owen.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.900
Earthy equals unshaven, unwashed

10:25.000 --> 10:28.900
and unable to stop going to concerts by bands
who jam to one song for hours.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.400
Bethany is adorable.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.000
Actually, I know a cool girl you should date.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.400
- Who?
- Jody watson.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.900
Wait. Who is jody watson,
and how do you know cool and available girls?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Jody was my personal service
rep at the cable company.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.900
She and I have had lengthy conversations about
how to best maximize my premium channels,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.900
and she knows everything about cinema.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
Get her started on sam peckinpah's body of work.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.300
Three hours can go by in the blink of an eye.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.300
Oh, really?

10:55.500 --> 10:59.400
This was, of course, long before you arrived

10:59.900 --> 11:03.800
and made it so there is a lantern
in the mine shaft of my mind.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.200
Honestly, have you all gone nuts?

11:06.600 --> 11:09.800
If you wanna meet a lady,
 you come to eddie latekka.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.800
I got hot divorced chick for ya, owen--vanessa.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.700
Vanessa's got what you're looking for.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.900
How much do you wanna bet bethany's the one?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.100
Well, how much you got?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.000
- How about 50 bucks?
- Whoa. I'll put that on jody.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.100
What are you guys doing?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
Okay, 50 bucks and a girl in the pot.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.200
Bethany versus jody versus vanessa.

11:27.300 --> 11:31.000
An old-school cage match for
owen rowan's slightly mangled heart.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.900
Whoever makes an honest love connection wins.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.100
my feet are sweaty.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.300
hey. This is a nice surprise.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.500
- I missed you last night.The concert was--
- don'T. I...

11:53.900 --> 11:56.000
I know about your father.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.700
- What?
- I saw you last night.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.200
- I followed you to the motel.
- You followed me?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.700
- You lied?
- I can't believeyou followed me.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.900
Well, I can't believe you lied.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.100
It's complicated with my father.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
So why didn't you just tell me that?

12:11.100 --> 12:15.000
you ever ignore something, hoping it'll go away?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.600
This is what he does.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.700
He shows up once or twice a year,

12:18.900 --> 12:23.800
full of promises about how he wants to make things
right, make up for lost time, blah, blah, blah.

12:23.900 --> 12:28.400
At first I resist. Then he gets
all sad-eyed and penitent, so I give in,

12:28.700 --> 12:32.400
and I open my heart to him,
 only to have him vanish again,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.800
once he hears of a game where the stakes are high,

12:34.900 --> 12:39.000
or--or an old girlfriend emerges from
the mothballs of a marriage and wants an encore

12:39.100 --> 12:43.200
or whatever flimsy excuse
he needs to perfect his knack for aving.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.800
I'm sorry.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.700
Me, too.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.900
I'm sorry I lied.

12:55.900 --> 13:00.000
If you're going through something,
I want you to feel like you can tell me.

13:00.100 --> 13:03.000
- I just want to be a part of your life.
- You are.

13:03.100 --> 13:07.500
It's my father who isn't,
and that's the way I want to keep it.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.100
Hey there.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.600
I thought we might break in the new bathtub.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.700
Brought my own bubbles.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.900
You told ikey you wanted to adopt sam?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.200
How could you do that?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.900
I'm sorry. I was excited.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I was moved to tell the world.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.000
You really need to slow it down, ray.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.800
Slow what down?

13:35.900 --> 13:38.300
It's like you feel it's necessary
to gather everything in a hurry

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
as if you're worried
it's all just gonna blow away.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.400
Hang on. That is not what I'm doing.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.700
Well, then what are you doing?

13:43.800 --> 13:45.800
Because it all just seems so panicked.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.300
Panicked?

13:47.400 --> 13:50.100
Well, is there something
I need to be panicked about?

13:50.500 --> 13:53.700
No. There isn'T.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.800
What is this really about?

13:55.900 --> 13:57.500
And do you even want me to adopt sam?

13:57.600 --> 14:00.200
Because you haven't said a thingto
me about it since i asked.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.900
I just don't want to open it
up to the ikeys of the world

14:02.000 --> 14:03.900
when I'm still trying to figure things out.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.300
I just want an answer either way.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.600
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.500
I mean, there are forms to sign,
and we need to speak to sam,

14:12.900 --> 14:14.200
and we need the birth father's okay,

14:14.300 --> 14:17.300
but other than that, it is that simple.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.500
hey. Sam, what goes on?

14:31.800 --> 14:34.000
You in the market for a new window? Huh?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.900
'Cause I can set you up.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.400
- I just came by to tell you that you're a liar.
- What?

14:39.500 --> 14:43.400
You said even if you weren't my dad,
you wanted to be my friend.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.800
That was a lie.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.300
Oh, sam, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was just distracted--

14:47.400 --> 14:49.800
it's not about yesterday.

14:49.900 --> 14:55.000
Ever since you saw my mom in that wedding dress
and realized it's never gonna happen for you two,

14:55.100 --> 14:56.700
you've just been gone.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.300
I'm sorry, sam. I-I-I've just been busy--

15:01.400 --> 15:03.900
I was stupid  to believe you.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.100
I should have known you were
just using me to get to my mom.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.000
I wasn't, sam, I promise.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.100
You know, my whole life, 
I never even knew you existed.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.200
Now I kinda wish you didn'T.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.300
so that's when I said, 
maybe cubism just isn't for me.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.400
I like people to look like people...
And flowers to look like flowers.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.200
That probably sounds totally
unsophisticated to you.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.300
No, it makes perfect sense.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.100
I think I'd be uncomfortable to
talk to a person who looks like a flower...

15:43.200 --> 15:47.600
the same way it'd be weird to give a dozen peoples
to a girl on valentine's d.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.000
I like him. He's eccentric.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.900
I always wanted to be eccentric.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.200
Well, you should wear a top
hat and drive a unicycle...

15:55.300 --> 15:57.000
And have a pet ostrich named stan.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.900
Yes!

15:59.300 --> 16:01.200
- Who wants more champagne?
- Oh, I do.

16:01.300 --> 16:04.800
- Me, too.
- All right, this is fun, right?

16:05.900 --> 16:10.200
Maybe you guys could pick another cd,
and I will go and get dessert.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.300
What do you think, owen?
Can we find something we both like?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.000
- We can.
- Okay.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.400
- What do you think about jam bands?
- Ooh, I hate 'em like a pestilence.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.400
Hooray!

16:22.200 --> 16:26.400
go ahead and pay me now.
We have a winner. Ding-ding- ding-ding-ding!

16:29.300 --> 16:30.600
Desert island select--

16:30.700 --> 16:35.000
you can take one cd to the desert island
where you are to spend the rest of your days.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.500
- What do you take?
- "Purple rain."

16:36.600 --> 16:40.100
- Wow. Not even a hesitation.
- "Purple rain" makes me happy.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.000
My kids and I dance to
 "when doves cry" all the time.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.900
We choreographed a whole routine.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.500
- Oh, right. Your kids.
- Wanna see a picture?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.600
Um, that's connor. It's kind of an old picture.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.700
Uh, oh! Here. That's a better one.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.900
And caitlin.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.200
Well, in this one, she's with her mom,
 so... I'm married.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
Oh. Right.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.000
Well, separated, I guess, though we
haven't officially set that up or anything.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.099
Oh. Okay.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.200
I mean, can you imagine your wife cheating on you
with your best friend?

17:11.300 --> 17:13.300
At first, you blame yourself.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.300
Maybe I could be in better shape
or have better hygiene,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.099
but I think I have good hygiene.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.300
Alison-- well, that's my wife-- 
she sometimes questioned my breath.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.900
She thought it smelled musty. I don't agree.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.300
I think it's naturally minty
on account of the mouthwash that I use.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.800
It gets retained.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.100
Do you wanna smell it?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.600
Hey.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.300
- feeling better?
- Oh, a little better.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
- can I ask you something?
- Sure.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.900
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.600
You know, all those years ago...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.900
did you... hate me for leaving?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.800
What?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.000
Oh, that's crazy. Of course not.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.700
I mean, I-I can handle it all, nicky...

18:03.700 --> 18:06.700
except, um, the missing you part.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.300
That was tough.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.900
But when you were a little boy,
I warned you never to speak to strangers,

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
never knowing that, uh, years later,
I'd qualify as one.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.300
Dad, you were never a stranger.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.000
Oh, that doesn't matter now.
I mean, you're back.You're here,

18:27.500 --> 18:29.400
and that's what counts.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
Remember this...

18:33.900 --> 18:38.000
life isn't then. Life isn't when.

18:38.500 --> 18:43.200
Life is this...here, now.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.500
You get that off a fortune cookie?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.300
No. I got it from your ma...

18:52.700 --> 18:56.000
who probably did get it off a fortune cookie.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.900
well, you know what it means?

18:59.100 --> 19:02.700
It means that life's too short
not to go dancing with the dean.

19:06.300 --> 19:10.600
Bethany's great. Thank you so much.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.700
I knew you'd like her.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.700
You know, I don't have to go
out with those other two girls.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.200
You should just take the money, 
and I'll take bethany.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.800
I was hoping you'd say that.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.300
Bethany's leaving.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.000
I forgot. I have a project due tomorrow,
so I should probably go.

19:26.100 --> 19:30.800
Oh, okay, well, uh,
I'll just get your number from these guys.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.900
Um... I don't think you should.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.400
Really? Why not?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.400
You know, just because,um...

19:41.300 --> 19:43.800
there'd be no point.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.600
I'm sorry.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.900
I'll see you in class?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.900
Thanks for dinner.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.500
- Sure.
- Okay.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.800
Judy says I can't go back to bowling till
I'm well enough to hang shelves in the garage.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.800
Women and their deals.

20:10.800 --> 20:15.200
It's like they're all sitting down at potsdam
looking for ways to divvy up berlin.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.100
How--how are things with leslie?

20:18.600 --> 20:22.800
- She wants to go dancin'.
- Dancing. I'm sorry.

20:22.900 --> 20:26.800
I used to like to dance
back in the pocket comb days.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.600
I also liked to ride motorcycles
really fast and drink till dawn,

20:30.700 --> 20:35.200
but I bet she wouldn't be happy
if I suggested we do that  along with the dancin'.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.200
But still, it must be nice to find love again.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.900
I mean, especially at your age.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.300
My age? You're not that much younger than me, doug.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.400
I sorta am, robert.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.800
Just fix my back so leslie
and i can go to the prom.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.800
Okay. Let's start with an x-ray,

20:50.900 --> 20:54.400
and we will have you up
and jitterbugging in no time.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.100
Okay.

21:03.700 --> 21:06.100
Boy, these small towns, I'll tell ya.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.000
I asked the meter maid,
she ever heard of nick garrett,

21:09.700 --> 21:13.900
and after a brief litany of obscenities
about some horrible novel,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.300
I'm promptly directed right here.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.500
Gabriel diaz, eddie latekka.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.900
Eddie latekka, gabriel diaz.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.600
Hello, mr. Diaz. I heard bad things about you.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.300
Only the worst are true.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.300
so... any progress?

21:33.200 --> 21:35.600
She doesn't want to see you...ever again.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.300
I know that.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.500
You know life intervenes, though.
 I mean, look at you.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.100
You showed up at my motel
when you're needed the most.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.300
I mean, that's wild, isn't that?
That--that's just-- that's kind of serendipity.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.100
I mean, you never know when these moments
of change are gonna happen like that, right?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.000
But when they do, nick, you gotta trust...

21:55.800 --> 21:58.300
they come along for a reason.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.200
Why should she believe you this time?

22:02.300 --> 22:07.600
Well, you get to be a certain age,
and there can, um...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.300
there's no percentage in the lies.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.800
you know who you remind me of?

22:18.900 --> 22:20.600
Shrek.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Thank you. I love that movie,
watch the dvd with my kids all the time.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.000
I-I-I-I mean, uh, my friend's kids.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.300
My--my--my--my brother'S...friend's kids.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.900
Just, it's, you know, kids, in general.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.500
I've never even seen the movie.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.300
You've never seen "shrek"?
Who's never seen "shrek"?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.800
How can you work at the cable company
and not see "shrek"?

22:41.900 --> 22:44.400
- I hate movies.
- You hate movies?

22:44.500 --> 22:45.800
Who hates movies?

22:45.900 --> 22:51.400
But I--phil said you two discussed movies 
with gat intelligence.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.700
So you wanna head back to my place?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.400
Um, um, I'm sorry, what?

22:56.500 --> 22:59.200
We're both single.
No, I don't find you particularly attractive,

22:59.300 --> 23:01.000
and I can tell you find me a little unpleasant,

23:01.100 --> 23:03.400
but it's a lonely night,
there's rain in the forecast,

23:03.500 --> 23:06.400
and I've got a great bottle of absinthe
back at my nest.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.595
So why don't you come over?

23:07.695 --> 23:10.813
We'll get alcoholized and
bend our backs in bed a bit.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.300
- hey. How's the back?
- Oh, back is gonna be fine.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.300
Muscle relaxers are kickin' in.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.200
I know I'm gonna have a date with the heating pad
for the next couple of nights,

23:29.300 --> 23:30.900
but all right.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Oh, well, I'm still glad you saw
the doctor just to be sure.

23:35.300 --> 23:39.600
- Thank you for going.
- No. Thank you for making me go.

23:39.700 --> 23:43.900
And as a token of my appreciation--this.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.800
What is this for?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.100
For you to dust off that red dress,

23:48.200 --> 23:52.800
'cause you're gonna be the finest-looking woman
thathe V.F.W. Has ever seen.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.800
Robert...

23:55.900 --> 23:58.400
Oh, robert, we really-- we don't--we don't have to--

23:58.500 --> 24:01.100
we're gonna. You know why?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
Life isn't then. Life isn't when.

24:05.500 --> 24:09.000
Life is this--here. Now.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
Did doug give you happy drugs?

24:11.300 --> 24:14.700
No. He didn't have to. It'S...

24:15.100 --> 24:17.800
the sort of thing you do for people you love.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.300
Love?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.300
It wasn't that strange,

24:30.400 --> 24:34.600
but it wasn't mantis-like, 
and it certainly wasn't praying.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.700
Totally.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.200
- Who's that?
- My dad.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.700
Gavin?

24:42.400 --> 24:45.000
- Did you call him, or did--
- yeah.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.900
Ma's here. You wanna talk to her?

24:47.000 --> 24:50.600
No, no, I have.Something in the oven.
I'll just call him later.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.600
She says she'll call you later.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.500
When are you gonna come up again?

24:55.600 --> 24:58.500
Maybe we can go to another celtics game.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.000
Really?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.100
yeah, that would be awesome.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.200
I should've asked myself, "what would eddie do?"

25:06.400 --> 25:08.500
'Cause I know you would've
taken that girl home, and--

25:08.800 --> 25:10.000
actually, no.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.600
I mean, just 'cause they wanna have sex with you
doesn't mean you have to have sex with them.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.500
But... maybe jody's the best I'm ever gonna get.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.500
I mean, bethany wouldn't even stay for dessert,
and it was boston cream pie.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.700
Wait for vanessa.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.000
Vanessa will be the cure for what ails you.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.100
my father still hasn't left.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.400
Got a million messages on my machine.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
Guess I should've refused
to see him a long time ago.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.200
It's the only thing that's made him stick around.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.400
You know, when I first got back, I met sam.

25:45.300 --> 25:46.500
It blew my mind--

25:46.600 --> 25:48.700
you know, not just the idea
that I might have a kid,

25:48.800 --> 25:53.600
but that I'd been missing from his life
for ten years without even knowing him.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.600
Yeah, but you wanted to be sam's dad.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.300
When you got the chance, 
you wanted to be a part of his life.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.700
That's the difference.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.200
I guess, but the point is, i t a chance.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.500
I mean, who would've known?

26:04.600 --> 26:10.000
I get writer's block, take a 1-day teaching job,
and then boom-- my whole world changes.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.500
Life intervenes.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.700
He's a really bad guy, nick.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.100
Yeah, well, certain people
may have said that about me.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.300
it's not the same thing.

26:20.600 --> 26:26.400
Yeah, but I just don't know where any of us
would be if everything stayed unforgiven.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.800
no, no, no, no, no.

26:31.900 --> 26:35.100
You put the pepperoni in the microwave first,
then you put it on the pizza.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.700
That way there's no puddles of grease
when it comes out the oven.

26:37.800 --> 26:42.500
I've always been more of an onions and eggplants
kind of guy, as opposed to pepperoni.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.500
Eggplant's for parmesan. Pepperoni is for pizza.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.100
What's with this kid,hannah?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.500
I thought you were raising him on the right.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.900
Actually, my father makes eggplant calzone--
blows you both out of the water.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.600
- what's so great about it?
- Oh, can't reveal the trade secrets.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.300
Like I'm gonna open up a restaurant,
put him out of business?

27:00.400 --> 27:05.100
No, but sometimes you just gotta know
when to keep your mouth shut.

27:09.900 --> 27:15.100
it's kinda fny being here with you and ray
when he's pretty much the guy who ruined my life.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.100
At least ray had the decency to
tell owen what was going on.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.200
I know.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.300
And one could argue that it was you
who pretty much ruined your life

27:24.400 --> 27:25.800
when you took up with alison.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.600
Believe me, I know.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.700
The worst part--eddie.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.400
I mean, owen-- I can understand that.
It was his wife.But eddie?

27:34.700 --> 27:36.600
He's the maddest of them all.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.000
- Eddie is
- yeah.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.600
- That's unbelievable.
- I know, right?

27:44.800 --> 27:48.800
Wait. Why is-- why is it unbelievable?

27:49.700 --> 27:51.000
Just...

27:51.200 --> 27:55.600
I mean, the guy sleeps with hundreds of women,

27:55.800 --> 27:57.300
and he's taking the moral high ground with you?

27:57.400 --> 28:01.400
Yeah, but none of them hundreds
were his best friend's wife.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.700
True.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.900
I don't know. It's just, eddie and I were partners.
We worked together for years.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.700
I saved him from drowning that summer.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.300
I don't remember that.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.700
Yeah, it never happened, 
but I convinced myself it did.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.300
I gotta maintain my outrage, you know?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.700
Well, I'm sure it's a tough situation he's in.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.500
He's trying to figure out what to do.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.300
just give him a chance.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.800
- He's just so furious.
- Yeah, well...

28:34.800 --> 28:37.200
he's never been the same since he almost drowned.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.900
Yeah.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.100
I always thought I'd go crazy after my divorce--

28:48.500 --> 28:50.900
become a wiccan,maybe join a coven,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.700
- like, witches?
- Good witches.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.400
but then I realized, I'm just a mom.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.400
You know, a regular mom.

28:59.700 --> 29:04.000
I like living in a small town,
and I loved being married.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.100
Me, too.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.700
Just couldn't convince my husband
to love being married,

29:09.900 --> 29:13.800
although, funnily enough, 
his 22-year-old massage therapiscould...

29:15.400 --> 29:18.200
Which is where the witches came in.

29:18.300 --> 29:23.000
I thought maybe I could cast a spell,
turn them both into cockroaches...

29:23.100 --> 29:27.600
and then turn yourself into a big,
rolled up newspaper and gush!

29:27.700 --> 29:29.200
Exactly.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.800
oh, that girl's in my yoga class.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.400
Come on. Let's sayI.

29:38.700 --> 29:41.000
- Alison, hi.
- Hey.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.100
- Hey, trent.
- Hi.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.400
- This is--
- hi, owen.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.500
You guys know each other?

29:46.600 --> 29:50.200
Um, owen is my ex-husband.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.600
- Ex-husband, huh?
- It's a figure of speech.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.400
I am so sorry. I had no idea.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.700
You gotta go on a date here, in this shop
where we buy ice cream for our kids, our shop?

29:58.800 --> 30:02.300
- Aren't you here on a date?
- Yeah, but... not with him.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.400
Come on, man. Look, we don't want any trouble.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.100
How long you been sleeping with him?

30:07.600 --> 30:09.300
It wasn't just my best friend, was it?

30:09.400 --> 30:12.100
Your yoga teacher, too? And who else?

30:12.200 --> 30:15.700
Hey, ice cream boy!
You sleeping with my wife, too?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.000
Owen, stop it!

30:17.100 --> 30:20.100
- You're taking this too far, pal.
- Do not "pal" me.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.100
I am not your pal.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.300
I am the furthest thing from your pal!

30:24.500 --> 30:28.100
Lounge out, man. Just... lounge out.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.600
oh, oh, god.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.200
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.700
come in.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.400
- Hello, robert.
- Oh, dr. Doug. What's this?

30:46.900 --> 30:48.600
I thought house calls were a thing of the past.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.000
- Well, in general, they are.
- Uh, my back's getting better.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.000
Oh, and leslie and i are going dancing after all.

30:54.100 --> 30:55.700
Good. I'm glad,

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
but, I, uh, I thought I owed it to you as a friend
to tell you this in person,

31:00.100 --> 31:04.200
and I knew you'd never show up
if I asked you to come back into the office, so--

31:04.300 --> 31:05.800
what's going on?

31:06.000 --> 31:09.200
Well, I'm concerned, robert,
about something that turned up on your x-ray--

31:09.300 --> 31:11.600
some gray patches.

31:11.900 --> 31:15.600
I'd like you to come in for another test-- 
a bone marrow aspirate,

31:15.700 --> 31:19.900
and I'd like you to see 
a friend of mine--an oncologist.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.800
what the hell are you talking about?

31:24.600 --> 31:28.600
An oncologist? That's cancer.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.200
Look, we don't know anything yet.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.200
Let's just do the test.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.800
these are rock-hard times, sully.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.200
I gave a girl a black eye tonight,

31:48.300 --> 31:52.900
but not on purpose, 
but her eye is black, just the same.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.600
You know, maybe there is just one person
for each of us on this planet.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.900
I hope not, otherwise I'm paying alimony
to three ladies who don't deserve it.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.200
Maybe alison was that person for me,

32:04.300 --> 32:06.800
and I messed it up, or she messed it up,

32:06.900 --> 32:09.900
but either way, it's really over.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.500
My time of happiness has passed,

32:12.600 --> 32:17.100
and now there's no one on this planet
who will make me feel the way alison did.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.700
So... line 'em up.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.400
- What are you juicin' tonight?
- Nah! No juice.

32:22.500 --> 32:27.300
I want chicken wings-- sully's finest wings,
as many as you got back there.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.600
You keep cookin' 'em, 
I'll keep eatin' 'em. Let's go.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.800
Hey.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.700
Phil told me you were here.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.500
Yeah, burning the midnight oil.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.300
Anyway, we have a shocking amount of paperwork
for such a small amount of jobs.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.900
- you and I need to talk.
- Okay.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.400
You have to knock it off with ikey.

32:55.900 --> 32:58.600
You have to forgive him.
You can't--you can't stay mad.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.100
okay.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.000
And, uh, when exactly did
this become y of your business?

33:05.100 --> 33:08.800
He's your friend, and he's a mess.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.900
So he screwed up.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.500
He's trying to make things right.
You know, he's sorry.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.200
He should be sorry.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.100
And my question's still
hanging out there, dangling.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.500
Why does this concern you?

33:20.600 --> 33:22.700
How can you act so self-righteous
and ep a straight face?

33:22.800 --> 33:23.700
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

33:23.800 --> 33:25.400
- It means you're being a hypocrite.
- A hypocrite?

33:25.500 --> 33:26.000
Come on, eddie.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.800
Like you don't know what it's like to sleep
with your best friend's girl.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.200
You were a hot mess when nick left town, hannah,

33:36.600 --> 33:39.800
and a lot went down that summer besides you
and me, and you have never dealt with any of it.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.500
- I deal with it every day.
- No, I don't think you do.

33:43.100 --> 33:46.000
I've come to you twice before
asking you to come clean.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.500
You wanna keep it a cret, fine.
My mouth is shut, but look at ikey.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.000
Nothing stays a secret forever.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.600
- Is that some sort of threat?
- Not at all.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.600
I made my peace with this a long time ago.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.400
You're a great mom, hannah.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.300
You're fierce and decent and loyal,

34:05.400 --> 34:08.800
but there is one thing that
you have never been, and that's accountable.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.199
So don't you come walking in here telling me
what's what, like you're lile miss virtuous,

34:12.300 --> 34:15.600
because we both know that's
the biggest lie out there.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.800
You're right.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.400
- I am?
- Yeah. You are.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.199
So I'm gonna do something
I should have done a long time ago.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.500
What's that?

34:40.600 --> 34:42.900
Be accountable.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.700
one bottle of sweet cherry wine.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.300
okay.

35:16.300 --> 35:19.100
let's give this a shot.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.200
- you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Thanks for coming.

35:35.500 --> 35:40.800
I was thinking maybe we could sit down over
a big bowl of ice cream and just talk.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.400
Okay.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.700
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't know. What are you getting?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.700
I was thinking about cherry.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Okay. I'll have cherry, too.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.700
listen, sam,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.400
I may not know much about being a good friend.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
I haven't been the best at sticking around,

36:12.600 --> 36:18.600
but I'm here now,
and I'd like to try, if you'll let me.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.700
We may not know each otherthat well yet,

36:21.900 --> 36:29.900
but from what I've seen, well, you are, I think,
a thing to be amazed by.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.500
I can't make up for lost time--

36:36.800 --> 36:39.000
all the things that you never had,

36:39.400 --> 36:42.200
all the time that we never spent together...

36:42.600 --> 36:45.200
but I meant what I said, sam--

36:45.300 --> 36:51.300
if I can't be a father to you,
well, I really do think that I can be your friend.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.700
isn't this fabulous?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.500
The best.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.500
Another round.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.000
oh, there it is. The old firebrand.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.900
It looks like the sweet
cherry wine has done it again.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.400
Yeah, life intervenes, firebrand.

37:34.500 --> 37:39.400
- That much we know, yes?
- Yeah. Yes.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.300
Well, good night to you both.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.600
Well, do you want me to walk you home?

37:47.200 --> 37:48.400
Or me?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.300
Or both of us?

37:50.400 --> 37:53.300
I'm good...for now.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.700
Thank you, gabe,
and thank you, nick.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.600
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.900
Hey, come on. Walk an old man home.

38:18.700 --> 38:20.100
what's wrong with that guy?

38:32.700 --> 38:34.700
are you okay?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.600
you know, thank you or everything, nick.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.900
eally, I'm glad you found me.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.900
I'm glad aubrey found you, you know?

38:48.200 --> 38:49.700
Yeah, me, too.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.600
- Uh, there's a car following us.
- Yeah, I know.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.900
Why is that?

39:00.200 --> 39:02.900
- I'll just be a minute.
- Yeah.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.600
- What was that about?
- Nah. It's, uh... my past catching up to me.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.100
You know, debts having to be paid.
It's all bull.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.900
What kind of deb?

39:30.800 --> 39:33.400
the kind that either I pay, which I can't,

39:33.500 --> 39:37.100
or I run or I get my ass
beaten to a pretty pulp, mm?

39:37.200 --> 39:41.500
You're not saying you just came back
into aubrey's life just to leave it again.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.400
Life intervenes, firebrand.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.700
Now that much we know, right?

39:53.800 --> 39:55.400
is sam here?

39:55.900 --> 39:58.200
Yeah, he got in a little while ago.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.000
He's in his room.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.200
- You okay?
- I am.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.200
You were right, ray.

40:06.500 --> 40:11.700
I've been hesitant and dragging my feet
'cause I've been afraid,

40:12.300 --> 40:16.300
but... I'm not afraid anymore.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.000
Okay.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.500
I love you so much, 
and I want us to be a real family.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.000
I still have to talk to sam, but

40:28.100 --> 40:31.700
as far as I'm concerned, 
we should just... move forward.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.400
Okay, wait. What are you saying?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.600
I'm saying "yes."

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Yes, you can adopt sam.
