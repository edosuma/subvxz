02:10.244 --> 02:12.996
"Happy Maiden Voyage."

02:13.080 --> 02:16.913
Mr and Mrs John Jacob Astor,
Stateroom A-56.

02:17.002 --> 02:20.834
- Not so fancy as some. Only bluebells.
- Have a look.

02:20.922 --> 02:23.960
"From the woods of Windsor Castle."
Blimey!

02:24.051 --> 02:28.844
Devonshire cream for Mr Benjamin
Guggenheim. Drop it at the icebox.

02:28.931 --> 02:32.052
"Happy Maiden Voyage, Mr Guggenheim."

02:32.145 --> 02:36.807
"Happy Maiden Voyage."
They're in a bloomin' rut!

02:36.899 --> 02:42.061
"Captain EJ Smith."
Deliver this to the bridge, and hop to it!

02:42.156 --> 02:44.232
"Mr and Mrs Straus."

03:24.164 --> 03:28.079
With this lot we're taking on
from the Continent, we'll have 2200 aboard.

03:28.169 --> 03:31.704
It's thick weather in the harbour.
But it'll be clear when you get out.

03:31.798 --> 03:33.209
Cherbourg to New York.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.467
- You'll go by the Great Circle route.
- Yes. A southern track.

03:36.553 --> 03:39.803
A fine start, Captain.
This is excellent tea.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.095
As to your running time,
we know you'll exercise prudence.

03:43.187 --> 03:46.188
However, the company
wouldn't resent a record run.

03:46.273 --> 03:49.311
They're good engines, sir.
Any other instructions?

03:49.402 --> 03:53.022
With a ship like this, there isn't
much to be said, except good luck.

03:53.115 --> 03:56.200
- And I wish I could go with you.
- Perhaps next time, sir.

03:56.286 --> 03:59.702
Yes. But that isn't a first sailing.

03:59.790 --> 04:04.453
- For you, sir.
- I suppose my wife dug up an extra shirt.

04:05.463 --> 04:10.589
"From Henry Evans,
Benbecula, The Hebrides."

04:12.305 --> 04:16.053
Captain Henry Evans.
I thought he was dead.

04:27.280 --> 04:32.276
It flew from the mainmast of the old
Star of Madagascar, nearly 40 years ago.

04:32.370 --> 04:36.451
I joined as an apprentice.
She was a fine sea boat.

04:37.251 --> 04:39.789
Shall we hoist it, sir?

04:39.878 --> 04:43.829
She's not top issue nowadays.
But up she goes.

04:51.099 --> 04:53.177
Mr Sanderson.

05:09.873 --> 05:13.372
Looks pretty good at that.

05:14.962 --> 05:17.999
The tender
is coming out from Cherbourg, sir.

05:18.091 --> 05:22.136
Mr Sanderson will go ashore on the tender.
Will you show him to the gangway?

05:22.220 --> 05:26.468
- Well, Captain, she's all yours.
- Goodbye, sir.

05:40.284 --> 05:43.071
Mind your helm! Steady as you go.

05:53.673 --> 05:55.833
Julia. Julia!

05:57.553 --> 06:02.050
- Sandy. I thought you were in Biarritz.
- My beautiful Julia, to these ears,

06:02.142 --> 06:05.642
- Biarritz has become a dirty word.
- How much did you lose this time?

06:05.730 --> 06:08.980
Well, these are borrowed trousers.
Where's your husband?

06:09.068 --> 06:12.438
- He didn't come.
- Good. Maybe we can cause a scandal.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.772
I'm afraid I brought the children.

06:14.866 --> 06:17.654
I thought you were
taking a house at Deauville.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.283
I changed my mind.
Annette! Norman!

06:22.291 --> 06:25.495
Sandy! Quel plaisir de vous voir ici.

06:25.587 --> 06:28.257
- She means "Hello".
- Norman.

06:28.341 --> 06:31.342
Good afternoon, sir.
I have to go to the starboard side

06:31.427 --> 06:34.263
to see the Marconi aerial.

06:35.724 --> 06:37.883
Stay right here.
I'll try to get a chair.

06:37.977 --> 06:42.022
Oh, John, I'm not the first woman
in the world who's going to have a baby.

06:42.107 --> 06:44.514
As far as I'm concerned you are.

06:44.609 --> 06:49.319
Forgive me, Mr Astor, but if you're looking
for a chair, perhaps my suitcase would do.

06:49.407 --> 06:52.693
- Why, thank you.
- Mr Astor, my name's Earl Meeker.

06:52.786 --> 06:56.321
- Yes. Thank you.
- I'm looking for the Widener maid.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.831
The maid of Mrs Widener.
Is Mrs Widener's maid around?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.161
The Wideners?
I think I saw them over there.

07:02.255 --> 07:06.040
I'm looking for the Widener maid.
I'm looking for the Widener maid.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.468
Widener maid.
I'm looking for the Widener maid.

07:09.555 --> 07:16.176
Well, don't look at me! I got so many maids,
some of the maids take care of the maids.

07:16.272 --> 07:18.515
Can't say I blame the poor fella.

07:18.608 --> 07:21.978
I just haven't got the kind of a face
that goes with a bankroll.

07:22.071 --> 07:26.532
I'll flash my badge
and blind a few people.

07:26.617 --> 07:30.367
My name's Maude Young,
Montana lead mines.

07:31.832 --> 07:34.749
Seasick? That some kind of a cure?

07:35.794 --> 07:38.750
No, it doesn't cure anything.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.923
No running, no pushing!

07:48.018 --> 07:49.975
Merci.
I'll pick that up.

07:50.061 --> 07:54.356
Have your boarding tickets ready!
Passagers, attention!

07:54.442 --> 07:59.983
La vedette bientot vient de retourner pour
prendre les passagers de troisieme classe.

08:00.073 --> 08:03.408
Mettez-vous devant la passerelle.

08:03.494 --> 08:05.902
Ne courez pas, ne vous poussez pas.

08:05.997 --> 08:08.703
Prenez vos billets d'embarquement.

08:08.792 --> 08:12.161
I'm Richard Ward Sturges.
I want to arrange passage.

08:12.254 --> 08:16.834
On the Titanic? I'm sorry, sir.
This first trip has been sold out since March.

08:16.927 --> 08:21.007
My congratulations.
However, I must be on that ship.

08:21.097 --> 08:24.515
I'd like to help you, sir, but I'm sorry.

08:34.615 --> 08:39.111
- Cuida la ninita.
- Cuidadito con el camastro.

08:39.203 --> 08:41.777
- No puedo hacer todo, eh?
- Es muy pesado.

08:42.832 --> 08:45.240
Perdon. You are Spanish?

08:45.335 --> 08:47.958
- We are Basque.
- From wine country.

08:48.048 --> 08:52.591
We go to California, Oregon perhaps.
Start grapes, make good wine.

08:52.678 --> 08:55.086
- You have land there?
- We buy little piece.

08:55.181 --> 08:59.013
Well, it needn't be such a little piece.
Now, you give me that ticket,

08:59.102 --> 09:04.524
and there's enough money here
to buy five times as much land.

09:10.407 --> 09:12.365
Madam, there's nothing to discuss.

09:12.451 --> 09:16.615
He can take the next boat and join you in
a week or so. One boat's as good as another.

09:21.586 --> 09:24.160
All right, I can always get someone else.

09:24.256 --> 09:30.212
Now, just stop and think. How many years
would it take you to buy 100 acres?

09:33.141 --> 09:37.971
Now, go into one of your tribal huddles
and convince your wife.

09:49.996 --> 09:51.869
Thank you, Mr...

09:51.956 --> 09:55.705
- Uzcadum.
- You've done me a great favour.

10:02.177 --> 10:06.045
Tender alongside.
Prepare for boarding.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.298
Stand by main elevators.

10:13.690 --> 10:17.141
Let every good fellow
now fill up his glass, vive la compagnie

10:17.235 --> 10:21.235
And drink to the health
of our glorious class, vive la compagnie

10:21.325 --> 10:25.073
Vive la, vive la, vive I'amour,
vive la, vive la, vive I'amour

10:25.162 --> 10:29.326
Vive I'amour, vive I'amour,
vive la compagnie

10:29.417 --> 10:32.334
Hey! Look at the one in the fur hat.

10:34.547 --> 10:42.130
- She's mine. You get the one way back there.
- Don't fight. There's plenty to go around.

10:42.223 --> 10:44.300
Come on.

11:15.972 --> 11:20.101
I'm the steward assigned to you, lady.
Just call me Giff Rogers. Carry your bag?

11:20.185 --> 11:24.136
Shouldn't you be in school somewhere?

11:27.944 --> 11:30.020
Come on, let's beat the rush.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.583
Drinks and draw for the first watch.
Hurry up, Dan.

11:41.669 --> 11:44.705
Keep it honest, keep it fair.
Come on, come on, come on.

11:44.797 --> 11:46.873
Well, chaps, here we go.

11:49.678 --> 11:53.546
- Don't trouble yourselves. Lucky Lightoller.
- Same old story.

11:53.641 --> 11:56.810
Mr Murdoch, Mr Wilde, Dan,
remove your bottles. It's my treat.

11:56.896 --> 11:58.438
It's a pleasure.

11:58.523 --> 12:00.978
All passengers aboard.
Stations for departure.

12:01.067 --> 12:04.519
- Very good, Thompson.
- Away you go, old man.

12:04.613 --> 12:09.821
And remember, first watch,
first man with the ladies.

12:15.458 --> 12:19.707
Fire all boilers!
Have a go, mates. Bend your back.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.298
- Slow ahead all.
- Slow ahead all, sir.

12:33.688 --> 12:36.690
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, Quartermaster.

12:36.775 --> 12:38.519
Steady as she goes, sir.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.533
- Full ahead all.
- Full ahead all, sir.

12:49.373 --> 12:54.120
- Full speed ahead from the bridge, sir.
- All right. Carry on!

12:54.212 --> 12:56.501
Let her have it!

13:06.020 --> 13:11.856
- Finish stations. Secure fore and aft.
- Finish stations. Secure fore and aft.

13:14.196 --> 13:15.856
All right, Mr Lightoller.

13:15.947 --> 13:18.438
- You may take her to sea.
- Aye aye, sir.

13:56.453 --> 13:59.739
Hey, you can't come up here.
This is for first class only.

13:59.832 --> 14:02.833
I'll do my best to behave properly.

14:11.930 --> 14:16.225
Oh, sir. Mr Sturges. You don't remember me,
but I was on the Queen Alexandria.

14:16.310 --> 14:21.768
Of course. Your name is Emma, your
daughter is married to a dentist in Plymouth.

14:21.858 --> 14:27.530
- What's the number of Mrs Sturges' cabin?
- Stateroom A-52/54. It's right over here.

14:27.615 --> 14:31.067
- But they've gone up to dinner now, sir.
- Richard!

14:31.160 --> 14:35.029
- John. Madeleine, my beautiful peacock.
- This is a surprise.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.243
Yes, it is. John, I'd like
to borrow a shirt and use your razor.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.291
I'm wearing my complete wardrobe.
I left in a hurry.

14:41.382 --> 14:44.549
- Help yourself. Take whatever you need.
- Oh, one more thing.

14:44.635 --> 14:48.136
If you happen to see Julia,
I'd rather you didn't tell her I'm aboard.

14:48.223 --> 14:50.595
I'd like to tell her myself.

14:52.102 --> 14:54.178
"Jean Pablo Uzcadum"?

15:11.834 --> 15:15.619
...I said, " What do you want him to do?
Flap his wings?"

15:25.392 --> 15:29.605
Mama, you should have protested.
It's a really bad table.

15:29.689 --> 15:31.729
There's not a person we know
at this end.

15:31.816 --> 15:35.435
Be brave, Annette.
These tragedies happen sometimes in life.

15:35.529 --> 15:39.397
Maitire d'hotel, where is Mrs Sturges' table?

15:39.492 --> 15:41.568
Mother. Look!

15:47.751 --> 15:51.038
Well, well.
This ship is filled with nice people.

15:51.131 --> 15:53.338
- Hello, Mr Sturges.
- Richard!

15:53.425 --> 15:55.833
Pommery, 1892.

15:55.928 --> 16:00.389
Mrs Straus, be careful of this old fox.
He has plans.

16:02.393 --> 16:04.801
- Father! How did you get aboard?
- Norman.

16:04.896 --> 16:08.100
By the back door. Good to see you, boy.

16:08.192 --> 16:12.142
- Hello, Sandy.
- Well... I can see a bridge game at last.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.316
Mrs Widener. George.

16:21.749 --> 16:24.242
- Annette.
- Father.

16:24.337 --> 16:29.082
Julia. You all look splendid,
and this is going to be great fun.

16:29.175 --> 16:32.794
- I'll get us a better table tomorrow.
- Daddy, I'm so glad you're here.

16:32.888 --> 16:38.015
I hope this doesn't upset your plans, Julia.
But Norman and I can bunk together.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.595
It's wonderful that you could get away.

16:40.690 --> 16:44.770
- My family will be pleased.
- It makes it a better celebration already.

16:44.860 --> 16:48.527
Can I send a message to Grandfather?
They have a wireless place upstairs.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.106
Might be a good idea. Run along.

16:51.201 --> 16:55.947
Nothing now, thank you.
I'll have a sandwich in the bar.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.041
Annette, I wonder
if you'd get a wrap for your mother.

16:59.128 --> 17:01.204
Yes, angel.

17:02.882 --> 17:09.134
Something funny about you, Father. I know.
I've never seen you without a flower before.

17:15.855 --> 17:18.228
Finish your coffee, Julia.

17:18.316 --> 17:21.982
We can walk on deck while I tell you
what I think of your performance.

17:22.069 --> 17:28.324
I'm in no hurry to finish my coffee,
and not too interested in your opinion.

17:28.412 --> 17:31.497
If I hadn't phoned the house,
you'd have got away with it.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.501
Will you explain
why you're kidnapping my children?

17:34.587 --> 17:36.829
- I'm not. I'm rescuing them.
- From what?

17:36.922 --> 17:39.081
- From you.
- That was my guess.

17:39.175 --> 17:42.675
This family reunion story
is a deliberate trick to get them away.

17:42.763 --> 17:44.839
It is. And they're never going back.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.218
They're going to stop
being rootless hotel children.

17:48.311 --> 17:52.356
- What's wrong with hotels?
- Oh, Richard, I...

17:53.817 --> 17:57.946
Richard, please try to see this sanely.
We're Americans. We belong in America.

17:58.031 --> 18:02.194
And yet for years we've been galloping
all over Europe to be in the proper places.

18:02.285 --> 18:05.489
Winter in St Moritz,
Deauville in season, summer in...

18:05.581 --> 18:08.535
What's the use?
The same silly calendar, year after year.

18:08.626 --> 18:12.043
- Look at Annette.
- I have, with great pride.

18:12.131 --> 18:16.176
She's entertaining, she's discriminating,
she has grace and style.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.885
She's an arrogant little prig.

18:17.970 --> 18:22.882
So you've chosen to drag her back
to the glories of Mackinac, Michigan.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.432
Any town in any state
becomes comic on your lips.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.597
But that's where she's going.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.976
To a big, ugly, pleasant house
with the scent of lilacs around it.

18:31.069 --> 18:35.317
Oh, don't worry. She won't turn out dowdy.
She'll meet dozens of nice boys.

18:35.407 --> 18:39.572
I have something better in mind for her
than being tied down to a lumber salesman.

18:39.664 --> 18:41.372
I know what you have in mind.

18:41.457 --> 18:45.622
I've seen a great many international
marriages, but never a happy one.

18:45.712 --> 18:48.915
I don't want to seem over-eager,
but, uh, could we...?

18:49.007 --> 18:53.469
Not tonight, Sandy, thank you.
More coffee, Julia?

18:55.556 --> 18:59.805
Do you think Annette will be grateful to you
for hauling her into the wilderness?

18:59.896 --> 19:03.347
In time. And as for Norman,
I can only tell you this:

19:03.441 --> 19:07.522
there's not going to be a carriage
waiting for him at 9am every morning.

19:07.613 --> 19:11.278
From now on, he's going to walk to school.

19:12.535 --> 19:16.320
Hm. I should have anticipated this.

19:16.415 --> 19:20.283
20 years ago, I made the mistake
of thinking I could civilise a girl

19:20.378 --> 19:23.914
who bought her hats
out of a Sears, Roebuck catalogue.

19:24.007 --> 19:29.298
I was wrong. And don't think
I haven't had my share of regrets.

19:31.808 --> 19:36.885
One thing, Richard.
You've... you've always been honest.

19:47.827 --> 19:49.619
Will this one do?
Where's Father?

19:49.705 --> 19:53.204
Never mind. It's bedtime.
Come on. It's been a long day.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.376
I sent the wireless, sir.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.542
Good.

20:03.804 --> 20:05.548
Well...

20:06.600 --> 20:10.978
- One game of checkers before we turn in?
- Yes, sir.

20:29.876 --> 20:33.745
No more sea gulls.
It's a mystery, it is.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.378
Take all the fish in the sea.
There must be millions.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.634
And you don't feel friendly
towards a single one.

20:39.721 --> 20:42.557
But put a bird in the sky,
and you feel like old chums.

20:44.602 --> 20:48.469
Listen, lad. This'll teach you
what kind of a boat you're working on.

20:48.564 --> 20:51.602
"Mr James J Hays, on board the Titanic."

20:51.693 --> 20:55.028
When he gets to New York, he'll have
a private train waiting for him.

20:55.114 --> 20:59.244
- That's handy. No waiting for a seat.
- "Mr Benjamin Guggenheim."

20:59.329 --> 21:04.870
"Countess of Rothes. Lady Duff Gordon.
Colonel Archibald Butts."

21:04.961 --> 21:09.753
The ship I was on before,
all we got was weather reports.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.840
Yes, sir?

21:13.929 --> 21:16.005
A form, please.

21:24.858 --> 21:28.192
- Guess I broke the pencil.
- Perhaps I could take it down for you.

21:28.278 --> 21:30.770
No, no, no. I'll do it myself.

21:35.453 --> 21:37.826
Um... Maybe if you would...

21:41.128 --> 21:43.666
It's to my brother.

21:43.755 --> 21:46.247
It's Mr Frank Healey,

21:46.342 --> 21:49.462
689 Boylston Street, Boston.

21:52.891 --> 21:55.299
I am coming home.

21:58.939 --> 22:02.356
I think you should advise the family now

22:03.779 --> 22:08.242
that last week the authorities in Rome...

22:09.829 --> 22:11.905
"Authorities in Rome..."

22:11.998 --> 22:14.571
...authorities in Rome...

22:15.209 --> 22:17.582
- I've got that, sir.
- Oh.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.498
Well, then say, uh...

22:24.888 --> 22:27.344
I'll be back later.

22:41.407 --> 22:46.402
The bar doesn't open till 11:30.
It's the rule on British ships, sir.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.785
I forgot.

22:55.257 --> 22:58.044
- A cup of bouillon, sir?
- No, thank you.

22:58.135 --> 23:00.211
He's not interested.

23:00.304 --> 23:03.840
That poor fella had no dinner last night
and no breakfast this morning.

23:03.933 --> 23:07.883
- What ails him?
- I've seen that look before.

23:07.979 --> 23:10.554
- He's a runaway.
- From what? Some woman?

23:10.650 --> 23:14.186
No. He's running too fast for that.

23:20.954 --> 23:23.327
- What's the commotion?
- Where I come from,

23:23.415 --> 23:25.740
this'd be a revival meeting or a crap game.

23:25.834 --> 23:30.165
Get your tickets for the anchor pool.
Ten dollars gives you a chance to win 600.

23:30.256 --> 23:33.376
Wait a minute. I wanna get in on this.

23:36.889 --> 23:38.005
How do you play this?

23:38.100 --> 23:41.599
Draw a number. If it corresponds
to the minute we drop anchor, you win.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.764
Five.

23:44.982 --> 23:48.601
Don't be shy there, Mr Straus.
Draw a good one.

23:48.694 --> 23:51.068
You draw, Mama.

23:51.156 --> 23:55.106
- What's our lucky number, dear?
- Seventeen.

24:07.092 --> 24:10.212
Hey, Tom. Here. You get it, will you?

24:21.818 --> 24:25.651
Morning. They're selling tickets
on the anchor pool down there.

24:25.739 --> 24:28.277
- Oh?
- Yes. I thought you didn't notice.

24:28.367 --> 24:33.991
- Maybe I could get one for you.
- No, thank you. I'm not much of a gambler.

24:35.125 --> 24:39.420
- How about some soup? Nice and hot.
- Thank you. I just had some.

24:39.505 --> 24:42.423
Oh, this is for Purdue.
It's a college out in Indiana.

24:42.508 --> 24:46.507
- Everybody thinks it's Princeton.
- I see.

24:46.597 --> 24:50.216
Well, to answer your question,
her name is Annette, she's going on 18,

24:50.310 --> 24:53.810
- and I think she's very pretty too.
- Well, now that you brought it up,

24:53.897 --> 24:56.898
I think I kinda got off
on the wrong foot with her.

24:56.984 --> 24:59.107
When I asked her
if I could sit next to her,

24:59.194 --> 25:02.647
she said she'd rather stand
all the way to New York.

25:02.741 --> 25:06.323
- What's your name?
- Giff Rogers. Gifford is a family name.

25:06.411 --> 25:08.784
My mother said one of us
had to be called Gifford.

25:08.873 --> 25:11.281
Sorry.
I always get friendly, pop off the bat.

25:11.376 --> 25:15.291
- Sit down.
- I'm on the tennis team.

25:15.380 --> 25:20.127
The athletic association shot us over to play
Oxford during Easter. We lost every match.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.220
- Will she be at the dance tonight?
- She likes music.

25:23.306 --> 25:25.181
I'd better get my blue suit pressed.

25:25.267 --> 25:29.597
Still the same. Young men hurrying
to get their blue suits pressed.

25:29.689 --> 25:34.982
Mrs Sturges, I bet I can count on you
to put in a good word for me.

25:36.948 --> 25:40.650
"When I was one-and-twenty,
I heard a wise man say,

25:40.745 --> 25:44.161
"'Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;

25:44.248 --> 25:47.749
"'Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free. '

25:47.836 --> 25:51.964
"But I was one-and-twenty,
No use to talk to me.

25:52.091 --> 25:54.961
"When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,

25:55.052 --> 25:58.257
"'The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;

25:58.349 --> 26:02.845
"'This paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue. " '

26:02.937 --> 26:05.974
That's pretty. But do you believe it?

26:06.066 --> 26:10.692
I can't answer for myself,
but if I were a tennis player from Purdue,

26:10.779 --> 26:14.315
I wouldn't believe it, not a single word.

26:36.726 --> 26:41.639
A fine, healthy bumpkin.
Are you breaking ground for Annette?

26:41.732 --> 26:43.109
You're up early.

26:43.193 --> 26:46.777
I had to scratch around for clothes.
Not a bad shop. They have everything.

26:46.864 --> 26:50.281
- Dinnerjackets, I trust.
- Naturally. It'll be ready tonight.

26:50.369 --> 26:53.074
So... life can go on.

27:04.926 --> 27:06.967
Good morning, Annette.

27:07.054 --> 27:09.807
I thought you were a pot of coffee.
What time is it?

27:09.891 --> 27:14.139
Eleven o'clock.
A brand-new day that's never been touched.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.436
I'm absolutely famished.

27:16.524 --> 27:19.311
Your brother never picks up anything.
Where is he?

27:19.402 --> 27:23.353
Where's my breakfast?
I sent him to order it half an hour ago.

27:23.449 --> 27:25.525
Beautiful. Lanvin?

27:25.617 --> 27:27.277
Mm-hm.

27:27.369 --> 27:30.371
- This one Lucille, I imagine.
- Yes, angel.

27:30.457 --> 27:32.996
Your mother seems
to have packed everything.

27:33.085 --> 27:37.464
Of course, some of them will be
a little out of place in Mackinac.

27:37.549 --> 27:40.918
Still, plenty of practical things.

27:41.011 --> 27:45.306
What, only high heels?
You'll have to have something to walk in.

27:45.391 --> 27:49.057
As soon as we arrive, you ought to
buy her some of those flat shoes.

27:49.146 --> 27:52.349
"Ground grippers", I believe.
She'll need lots of things.

27:52.441 --> 27:55.195
That'd be a waste of money
forjust a short visit.

27:55.279 --> 27:58.031
Let's not talk about that now.
Get up, Annette.

27:58.115 --> 28:00.820
As your mother has said,
it's a brand-new day.

28:00.911 --> 28:03.402
Yes?

28:04.456 --> 28:08.584
Ah. Thank you, Emma.
Those cheeks of yours bloom in the salt air.

28:08.668 --> 28:11.207
- Oh, Mr Sturges.
- Annette?

28:13.549 --> 28:15.838
There we are.

28:17.679 --> 28:21.381
- May I bone your kipper, mademoiselle?
- Yes, angel.

28:21.476 --> 28:24.810
- Is today the 12th or the 13th?
- The 13th.

28:24.897 --> 28:27.388
They should just be sitting down to luncheon

28:27.483 --> 28:30.603
in that extraordinary room
overlooking the fountains,

28:30.694 --> 28:34.563
the arthritic old princess
under the finest crystal chandelier in Europe,

28:34.658 --> 28:38.572
and Mr Paderewski
complaining about the draught.

28:38.662 --> 28:43.124
And at the end of the table, one young man
next to an empty chair with a tear in his eye.

28:43.210 --> 28:46.709
A crystal tear is my guess.
What excuse did you give him, Annette?

28:46.797 --> 28:49.170
I dropped him a note.

28:49.259 --> 28:51.880
- Let's go.
- A note? Was I supposed to be somewhere?

28:51.970 --> 28:56.301
It's perfectly all right if your mother
explained it to them. See you later.

28:56.393 --> 28:59.512
- Wait. Explain it to me.
- What's one party more or less?

28:59.604 --> 29:03.222
Julia, a luncheon at the Metternichs'
is not exactly a wiener roast.

29:03.316 --> 29:06.485
Was there some reason, Mother,
I wasn't told I was invited?

29:06.571 --> 29:08.315
Your mother's a sensible woman.

29:08.407 --> 29:12.655
She probably felt something might come of
it, some involvement with the young master.

29:12.745 --> 29:16.695
To be perfectly frank, I was afraid.
He's an arrogant little toad.

29:16.791 --> 29:20.956
He does look a little like a toad.
But he's a highly eligible toad.

29:21.046 --> 29:24.878
Not many young men are related to both
the Metternichs and the Rothschilds.

29:24.967 --> 29:30.473
I don't think he looks like a toad. And I see no
reason why we couldn't have left a week later.

29:30.558 --> 29:36.015
Annette, mind your manners.
It wasn't a question of a week or two weeks.

29:36.106 --> 29:40.104
This was as good a time as any to bow out.

29:40.193 --> 29:43.279
- "Bow out"?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.489
Ah, adieu, great world.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.408
What your father is saying
is that I'm taking you home for good.

29:50.496 --> 29:57.876
I won't see an arranged marriage, or you
jumping from title to title the rest of your life.

29:57.964 --> 30:02.545
Father, I want to ask you one question:
do you approve of all this?

30:02.637 --> 30:06.256
Annette, I adore you, you know that.

30:06.893 --> 30:10.593
Are you going to stay in Michigan for good?

30:11.647 --> 30:16.774
I'm a hopeless case,
far too old to alter my preferences now.

30:18.364 --> 30:22.113
- When are you going back?
- By the next boat.

30:23.537 --> 30:26.823
Whenever you go, I go with you.

30:29.543 --> 30:32.545
As for you, Mother, I love you very much,

30:32.631 --> 30:35.418
but my address is Paris, France.

30:43.977 --> 30:47.228
Thank you, Richard.
You were most helpful.

30:47.315 --> 30:50.601
Now you see why
I wanted to steal a little more time.

30:50.693 --> 30:55.237
Please, Julia, let's not bicker,
since there's no love lost between us.

30:55.324 --> 31:01.862
That's the tragic part, Richard.
There's been so much love lost between us.

31:11.719 --> 31:16.132
- Hurry up! We have our first match at 11:30.
- If it's not asking too much, what match?

31:16.224 --> 31:22.762
- The shuffleboard tournament. I entered us.
- Good. We're the team to beat.

31:57.481 --> 32:02.309
I'm going to dress for dinner. Alter course
at ten o'clock. It's posted in the chart house.

32:02.403 --> 32:04.361
What's this note, "binoculars"?

32:04.448 --> 32:07.651
- It's Murdoch, sir. We're shy on binoculars.
- Oh. How come?

32:07.743 --> 32:10.364
I don't know, sir.
We've got enough for the bridge.

32:10.454 --> 32:13.243
The lookouts and the crow's nest
are doing without.

32:13.333 --> 32:19.124
Well, make up a requisition.
We'll pick up some in New York.

32:22.011 --> 32:24.679
- It's very nice material.
- It's a beautiful suit.

32:24.763 --> 32:28.845
I said it was nice material.
You did a fast job. Thank you.

32:28.935 --> 32:31.640
I'd better have a handkerchief.

32:31.730 --> 32:35.430
Norman, it's time for us to pick up our ladies.

32:35.525 --> 32:37.650
- Norman?
- Yes, sir?

32:38.697 --> 32:41.449
Would it be all right
if I ate in the cabin tonight?

32:41.533 --> 32:43.906
We're dining at the captain's table.

32:43.995 --> 32:47.115
That's just it, sir.
I'd feel out of place.

32:47.207 --> 32:51.668
There's something bothering you.
What is it?

32:51.754 --> 32:53.545
It's nothing, sir.

32:55.633 --> 32:57.921
Is this what's worrying you?

32:58.010 --> 33:01.677
There are two other boys on this ship.
They're an inch shorter than I am,

33:01.766 --> 33:03.343
and they have long trousers.

33:03.434 --> 33:06.803
You're a worthless scamp.
You've been growing behind my back.

33:06.896 --> 33:11.475
Mr Webster, this is no way
to let a young man walk out of your shop.

33:11.568 --> 33:15.863
- You'll have to put in some more overtime.
- It's a pleasure, sir.

33:15.949 --> 33:19.780
- Your fitting, Mr Sturges.
- Thank you, sir.

33:43.272 --> 33:48.814
Mother, could you help me with this snap?
If you're busy, I can call the stewardess.

33:48.905 --> 33:51.478
That won't be necessary.

33:56.414 --> 34:00.032
- I love those earrings on you.
- Thank you.

34:04.673 --> 34:07.709
Are we going to cross the entire ocean
in polite silence?

34:07.801 --> 34:14.054
I'd be very happy to chatter like a magpie
if I could think of a single word to say.

34:18.062 --> 34:19.878
Come in.

34:20.065 --> 34:22.984
- Well, are we ready?
- Yes, angel.

34:25.155 --> 34:27.647
- You look beautiful.
- I'm glad you're pleased.

34:27.741 --> 34:30.030
Norman's at the tailor's.
Will you pick him up?

34:30.119 --> 34:35.163
- I don't want to go into dinner with him.
- Then you can trail at a respectful distance.

34:35.252 --> 34:39.830
- We'll all meet at the captain's table.
- Yes, angel.

34:41.300 --> 34:45.879
Well, Julia, I imagine after a few hours
we've reached the same conclusion.

34:45.972 --> 34:51.928
We scream, we shout, we hurt each other,
but we calm down. Things aren't so bad.

34:52.021 --> 34:54.179
They never are for you.
You always win.

34:54.273 --> 34:58.853
I don't regard this as a victory.
It's an adjustment.

35:02.116 --> 35:05.616
Before you go down,
you'd better know how things are going to be.

35:05.704 --> 35:10.366
I've given up on Annette. Her standards will
always be the chic club, the royal enclosure,

35:10.459 --> 35:13.211
and that's her decision,
she's almost of age.

35:13.296 --> 35:17.874
But Norman is still a child. I'm not taking
any chances with him. He stays in America.

35:17.967 --> 35:22.964
Now, wait a minute, Julia.
What is this all about?

35:23.058 --> 35:26.925
I should think it would be perfectly clear.
I won't see Norman thrown away.

35:27.020 --> 35:31.482
He stays with me. And if you try to interfere,
I'll be as common as you think I am.

35:31.567 --> 35:36.563
I'll fight you tooth and nail.
I'll take you to the courts!

35:37.616 --> 35:41.779
- Could you be common in a lower voice?
- I'll say it in any tone you want.

35:41.870 --> 35:44.078
But that's the way it's going to be!

35:44.167 --> 35:49.078
You crazy woman. You're talking about
the most important thing in my life.

35:49.172 --> 35:52.672
- I have plans for Norman.
- That he should grow up to be you?

35:52.760 --> 35:55.251
Possibly. I'm satisfied.

35:56.680 --> 36:00.810
Is it so extraordinary that I should want
to have some portion of myself survive?

36:00.894 --> 36:05.390
Some portion of your...? Oh, yes, I forgot.
The best-dressed man of his day.

36:05.482 --> 36:08.604
That's what they're going to write
on your tombstone.

36:08.695 --> 36:12.527
But I won't have it for Norman.
He stays with me!

36:12.616 --> 36:16.911
My dear Julia,
I've been around enough bridge tables

36:16.996 --> 36:20.531
to recognise someone
who is holding a high trump.

36:20.625 --> 36:23.829
Play it now, if you're going to.

36:25.381 --> 36:27.670
We'll discuss it later.

36:28.551 --> 36:30.627
Now!

36:31.722 --> 36:37.512
- All right, Richard. One question first?
- If it's about Norman, you know the answer.

36:37.603 --> 36:43.061
No court in the world, no power under heaven
can force me to give up my son.

36:43.152 --> 36:45.228
He is not your son.

37:45.225 --> 37:49.686
All I propose, Mr Straus,
is a small game at small stakes.

37:49.773 --> 37:53.770
Don't act as if I were on a banana boat.
I prefer good bridge and poverty.

37:53.860 --> 37:56.944
Sounds rather like St Francis, doesn't it?

37:57.030 --> 38:01.030
- Mr Sturges. Someone's looking for you.
- Richard, this young man...

38:01.119 --> 38:05.499
At the door there's a woman. Some name
like "Uzcadum". She's French, I guess.

38:05.584 --> 38:11.872
- Will you excuse me a moment, Captain?
- I believe we've all finished.

38:11.965 --> 38:14.504
Do you expect to be
long in New York, Mrs Astor?

38:14.594 --> 38:17.381
Your mother thought
you might like to dance tonight.

38:17.472 --> 38:20.010
She and I got to be very good friends.

38:20.100 --> 38:25.890
I'm afraid I forgot to mention you, Mr Rogers.
We were talking about something else.

38:25.981 --> 38:28.687
If Mr Rogers would like a dance,
I'd be delighted.

38:28.777 --> 38:30.854
You would?

38:32.532 --> 38:37.195
- The dance floor is this way, isn't it?
- This is great. And the band's slick.

38:37.287 --> 38:40.952
- Wait till you meet the other fellows.
- We're going to have one dance.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.449
Just one?

38:43.544 --> 38:47.792
I was quite horrid to my mother today.
If I can please her by dancing with you...

38:47.882 --> 38:52.130
- As I said before, I'd be delighted.
- OK. What's the difference?

38:52.221 --> 38:58.556
If you get a good omelette, who cares
whether the chicken likes you or not?

39:20.755 --> 39:22.831
Keep going.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.375
Right. Now, sign this too.

39:29.932 --> 39:32.851
- Both of them.
- I still say not right to sign this.

39:32.936 --> 39:36.103
- I am not head of family...
- Please, Mrs Uzcadum.

39:36.189 --> 39:40.141
Do me a favour, and stop worrying.
Here, sign.

39:48.747 --> 39:52.329
Now, you keep these papers.
I'll send the steward tomorrow.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.908
Say, uh... we're getting up a bridge game.

39:55.003 --> 39:58.171
Sandy Comstock tells me
you're a player from away back.

39:58.257 --> 40:00.333
Yes.

40:15.819 --> 40:18.572
You need a topcoat, Richard.
It's grown cold.

40:18.656 --> 40:20.697
Yes, it has.

40:21.744 --> 40:24.033
The Labrador Current.

40:28.377 --> 40:31.581
I wonder if you'd tell me, Julia.

40:31.672 --> 40:35.623
Have I been the laughing stock
of our friends all these years?

40:35.719 --> 40:39.669
- Does everybody know?
- No one except you and me.

40:39.765 --> 40:42.386
Aren't you forgetting
at least one other person?

40:42.476 --> 40:45.394
Not even he. I never saw him again.

40:46.439 --> 40:48.729
What very good manners.

40:50.152 --> 40:53.688
There's no way for me
to make it seem right.

40:53.782 --> 40:58.777
It happened after one of those endless rows
and private humiliations,

40:58.871 --> 41:02.454
in the days before you made me over
into your image.

41:02.542 --> 41:05.911
One of the summers we had the beach house.

41:06.003 --> 41:10.049
I'd left a party because I knew I'd cry
if there was one more reference made

41:10.133 --> 41:14.844
to my gaucherie,
to the... to the dress I had chosen to wear.

41:14.932 --> 41:20.306
On the beach by our cottage a young man
was skipping stones across the water.

41:20.396 --> 41:24.858
He assured me he was not a burglar,
and we began to talk.

41:24.944 --> 41:29.606
He said something admiring to me
when I needed it most,

41:29.700 --> 41:33.069
a pure, sweet, unsolicited compliment.

41:33.161 --> 41:38.668
I... I took his face in my hands,
and kissed him out of gratitude.

41:41.547 --> 41:46.126
You... you needn't trouble yourself
as to who he was,

41:48.096 --> 41:52.473
except that he was
a much nicer person than you or I.

42:14.001 --> 42:16.872
I think I understand.

42:16.963 --> 42:21.839
From now on, Norman belongs to you.
I shall make no claim.

42:23.179 --> 42:26.762
Both of you will be taken care of decently.

42:27.809 --> 42:33.600
But I don't want to see him
or hear from him or... be remembered by him.

42:33.692 --> 42:37.476
- Is that really necessary?
- I'm afraid it is.

42:37.571 --> 42:41.273
As you pointed out,
Norman and I began as strangers.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.782
So be it.

42:44.871 --> 42:50.543
Oh, my poor Richard. How you hate me.
And for the wrong reasons.

42:50.629 --> 42:54.958
Not because I committed an offence
against common decency,

42:55.050 --> 43:00.425
but because Norman isn't an elegant
extension of Richard Ward Sturges.

43:00.515 --> 43:07.811
For you, what happened isn't a mortal sin.
It is an inexcusable breach of etiquette.

43:08.857 --> 43:12.275
Thank you, Julia. I stand reproved.

44:20.359 --> 44:22.436
Good evening, Mr...

44:33.833 --> 44:35.327
Harry?

44:35.418 --> 44:37.494
Thank you.

44:44.679 --> 44:46.756
- I see you have your game.
- You're in it.

44:46.849 --> 44:50.183
- Mr Guggenheim's keeping the seat warm.
- Uh, two no trump.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.761
A heart bid from there.

44:52.856 --> 44:55.526
You can only play
one more rubber, Mr Straus.

44:55.610 --> 44:58.611
Whenever you feel like stopping,
I can take over, sir.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.483
- My trick.
- Do you mind?

45:20.639 --> 45:22.596
Aldebaran...

45:23.642 --> 45:26.560
you lonely star.

45:27.104 --> 45:29.180
Look around at the others.

45:29.273 --> 45:32.608
The friendly Pleiades are better off.
There's seven of 'em.

45:32.694 --> 45:35.317
No, wait. Let me count.

45:35.406 --> 45:37.529
Answer up for the roll call.

45:37.617 --> 45:41.236
There's four... six... seven.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.328
They're all there.

45:48.629 --> 45:54.503
Have you ever noticed, my dear lady,
that the stars are never late?

45:55.680 --> 45:58.137
They made you cry.

45:58.226 --> 46:00.551
Or wasn't it the stars?

46:02.522 --> 46:06.105
Yes. Yes, yes, I... I'm drunk.

46:06.193 --> 46:10.025
I... I'm always two things:
I'm drunk, and I'm helpful.

46:10.614 --> 46:16.321
- Thank you, I don't need any help.
- Then you're very, very unique.

46:16.413 --> 46:22.453
"Very unique". It's a grammatical error.
"Unique" stands by itself.

46:34.725 --> 46:37.218
Are you hurt?

46:38.272 --> 46:40.561
I'm all right.

46:40.650 --> 46:46.072
If, uh... you would just be so kind
as to point me toward the bar.

46:46.157 --> 46:48.992
You're going to your cabin.
What number is it?

46:49.076 --> 46:53.454
- My dear, unique lady, I am going to the bar.
- No, you're not.

46:53.540 --> 46:56.113
Where is the key to your cabin?

47:15.024 --> 47:18.524
- I'll send in the ship's doctor.
- No, no, no, no. Let him sleep.

47:18.612 --> 47:22.360
Got some, uh, spirits of ammonia over here.

47:24.035 --> 47:26.323
I'll get it. Sit down.

47:46.185 --> 47:48.511
Take this.

47:48.605 --> 47:50.682
Good night.

47:50.775 --> 47:54.358
- Thank you for being so generous.
- That's all right. Just go to bed.

47:54.446 --> 48:01.243
You know what I mean. Thank you for
not mentioning my... strange luggage.

48:01.328 --> 48:04.496
- Are you a minister?
- Priest.

48:04.582 --> 48:07.536
Or, rather, I was until last week.

48:07.627 --> 48:11.839
At three o'clock on April 8th, my duties,
my privileges as a servant of God,

48:11.924 --> 48:14.298
were formally terminated.

48:15.805 --> 48:18.094
It was this.

48:19.684 --> 48:23.267
You know why I started -
at least, the reason I gave myself?

48:23.355 --> 48:28.148
A priest in a slum parish knows all the
sadness of the world. He needs support.

48:28.236 --> 48:31.854
So I used to lean on a little Hennessy's.
Just a little at first.

48:31.948 --> 48:37.822
People said, " Well, that's only natural.
The young father has a bad cold."

48:37.914 --> 48:42.162
It got so I used to have those colds
in the middle of July, lots of 'em.

48:42.253 --> 48:48.587
I can hear the bishop's voice now:
"Do you prefer that stuff to your God?"

48:48.676 --> 48:52.544
Well, God and I knew better,
but I couldn't stop,

48:52.639 --> 48:56.055
because I had a private devil all my own.

48:59.313 --> 49:02.766
In Rome, they were very kind,
but they were very final.

49:02.860 --> 49:07.653
I was sacked and prayed for,
and sent off in the morning.

49:09.784 --> 49:13.653
How do you cover that
in ten words in a wireless

49:13.747 --> 49:17.994
to a family that loved you
and sacrificed for you?

49:23.342 --> 49:25.253
You see, my dear lady,

49:26.305 --> 49:30.469
you're not the only one
who walks in trouble.

49:33.396 --> 49:35.519
Good night.

50:10.313 --> 50:13.184
Can I have some eggs, please?
Three minutes.

50:13.275 --> 50:16.111
How's topside?
Is that bridge game still going on?

50:16.196 --> 50:22.032
- I don't think they're ever gonna stop.
- Well, time to relieve the chief.

50:22.118 --> 50:26.497
Be careful of that coffee.
It can stand up and walk!

50:34.468 --> 50:37.338
- Morning, Chief. Ready to relieve.
- Good morning.

50:37.429 --> 50:41.298
Steering south 71 west, speed 21 knots.

50:41.392 --> 50:45.342
- 21? Who ordered the increase?
- The captain.

50:50.986 --> 50:53.062
Jackson!

50:55.325 --> 50:59.075
Take over a moment.
I must speak to the captain.

50:59.163 --> 51:03.411
Holy, holy, holy

51:04.461 --> 51:10.250
Though the darkness hide thee

51:10.342 --> 51:20.060
Though the eye of sinful man
thy glory may not see

51:22.440 --> 51:27.602
Only thou art holy

51:27.697 --> 51:33.533
There is none beside thee

51:33.619 --> 51:38.282
Perfect in power

51:38.376 --> 51:47.251
In love and purity

51:47.345 --> 51:52.554
Amen

52:00.986 --> 52:03.559
The Lord bless us, and keep us.

52:03.655 --> 52:07.606
The Lord make his face to shine upon us,
and be gracious unto us.

52:07.702 --> 52:13.207
The Lord lift up his countenance upon us,
and give us peace, now and for evermore.

52:13.292 --> 52:15.369
Amen.

52:23.220 --> 52:25.379
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Captain.

52:25.473 --> 52:28.592
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- Excuse me, sir.

52:28.684 --> 52:31.521
There's an iceberg warning
posted in the chart house.

52:31.606 --> 52:35.935
- Yes, I know. I put it there.
- I just wondered about our speed, sir.

52:36.027 --> 52:40.026
It's a clear sea, and our track
takes us south of the reported ice field.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.487
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

52:42.576 --> 52:47.039
Mr and Mrs Astor, I should like you
to meet our second officer, Mr Lightoller.

52:47.124 --> 52:51.585
He's worried about our ship.
I remember a man like that in the old days.

52:51.670 --> 52:55.836
Always afraid we were carrying too much sail.
But the wind never did us any harm.

52:55.927 --> 53:00.505
- I like your spirit, Mr Lightoller.
- Thank you, sir.

53:03.435 --> 53:05.641
All right if I skip now?
Big match coming up.

53:05.729 --> 53:07.805
Yes, dear.

53:23.875 --> 53:27.708
I believe that's your trick, Widener.
Are you leaving it there to hatch?

53:27.797 --> 53:30.667
Sorry, Sturges.
I'm knocked out.

53:31.717 --> 53:34.553
It's almost 10:30, Father.
We should have a warm-up.

53:34.638 --> 53:37.425
You'll have to find someone else. I'm busy.

53:37.516 --> 53:40.304
- Yes, sir.
- An even hundred rubber.

53:40.395 --> 53:44.263
- That's enough for me.
- I guess it's time for us all to quit.

53:44.358 --> 53:46.766
I see no reason to stop.
We'll get a fourth.

53:46.860 --> 53:50.610
I'll be glad to fill in,
if it's all right with everybody.

53:50.699 --> 53:52.775
Please do.
Cut.

53:52.867 --> 53:55.787
The name's Meeker. Earl Meeker.

53:55.872 --> 53:59.206
All right, let's have some more coffee
and double the stakes.

53:59.292 --> 54:02.626
- How much do I owe?
- We'll let you know.

54:04.382 --> 54:07.668
Excuse me, Father.
Maybe I could have the match postponed...

54:07.761 --> 54:12.424
I told you I'm not interested in the match.
Find someone else!

54:12.517 --> 54:14.593
Yes, sir.

54:22.403 --> 54:24.230
- Spade.
- Pass.

54:24.321 --> 54:25.732
Two hearts.

54:28.493 --> 54:31.365
He certainly clouded up.

54:31.456 --> 54:35.289
Well, a word'll do it faster
than a hickory stick anytime.

54:35.377 --> 54:38.082
A spade. Two hearts. Your call.

54:38.172 --> 54:40.460
I pass.

54:49.142 --> 54:51.930
- Morning.
- Hello.

55:23.643 --> 55:27.890
I guess it's of no importance, but I wanted
to tell you something about last night.

55:27.980 --> 55:32.145
No need to. You danced with me four times.
That's more than I figured on.

55:32.236 --> 55:35.818
No, I mean the way
I walked off without saying anything.

55:35.906 --> 55:38.861
It wasn't very adult of me,
and I believe in being adult.

55:38.953 --> 55:43.579
Just forget it. You did your bit, only I
kind of figured you were having a good time.

55:43.666 --> 55:47.166
- To be frank, I was.
- You left me in the middle of the floor.

55:47.253 --> 55:52.592
I didn't know what to do when the orchestra
started playing that funny dance.

55:52.676 --> 55:54.503
- The Navajo Rag?
- That's the one.

55:54.595 --> 55:57.300
- I'd never heard it before...
- Never heard it?

55:57.390 --> 56:01.090
Where have you been? Locked up?
Why, that's the hottest jig the kids do.

56:01.186 --> 56:07.308
Yes, I noticed those girls with your friends.
They seemed to, well... shake automatically.

56:07.402 --> 56:11.615
- Especially the pretty one with the dark hair.
- Oh, she's a glue-foot.

56:11.700 --> 56:14.784
Come here. I'll show you how to do it.

56:14.869 --> 56:17.990
Now, look. All you have to do is this.

56:22.253 --> 56:24.745
There's a dance they do
on the reservation

56:24.840 --> 56:27.379
It's a dip and a glide
and a hesitation

56:27.468 --> 56:29.924
Then you grab your squaw and drag

56:30.012 --> 56:32.765
They call it the Navajo Rag

56:32.850 --> 56:35.388
Ho, ho-ho, that Navajo Rag

56:35.477 --> 56:37.470
What a rag, what a rag, what a rag

56:37.563 --> 56:40.399
Ho, ho-ho, that Navajo Rag

56:40.483 --> 56:42.523
That drag, that drag, that drag

56:42.610 --> 56:44.936
Shake your moccasins
and roll your eye

56:45.029 --> 56:47.567
Tear my blanket, make my feathers fly

56:47.657 --> 56:49.817
Whirl me

56:49.911 --> 56:52.449
Twirl me

56:52.539 --> 56:56.787
Whirl me, twirl me
to that Navajo Rag

57:04.428 --> 57:09.220
If we're going to be stared at,
I think we should do this to real music.

57:09.308 --> 57:13.010
Whenever there's another dance,
will you ask me?

57:14.523 --> 57:17.441
Goodbye, gentlemen.

57:20.072 --> 57:21.104
Bye, Giff.

57:22.158 --> 57:23.189
Bye.

57:25.411 --> 57:26.870
Yee-hoo!

57:50.982 --> 57:52.940
- Three spades.
- Double.

57:53.027 --> 57:54.486
Content.

58:06.835 --> 58:10.999
Why must the British announce dinner
as if it were a cavalry charge?

58:11.090 --> 58:14.007
- Shall we break?
- Just when I'm getting some good cards?

58:14.093 --> 58:16.585
Your grief has been noted.
We'll break later.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.968
That's what you said about luncheon.

58:19.057 --> 58:22.806
By the time we dock,
I'm gonna be one long loaf of liverwurst.

58:22.895 --> 58:25.565
Sorry, partner. Not much there.

58:26.608 --> 58:28.934
- Oh, Harry.
- Yes, sir?

58:29.028 --> 58:33.193
- Is the water still hot?
- I just brought it, sir.

58:54.934 --> 58:57.686
Is it necessary to lurk in dark corners?

58:57.770 --> 59:00.807
I've come to ask you
to have dinner with the children.

59:00.898 --> 59:04.268
What I really mean
is to have dinner with Norman.

59:04.361 --> 59:08.738
Don't worry, you won't have to
put up with me. I'll eat in the cabin.

59:08.824 --> 59:11.910
Oh, please, Richard.
Don't take it out on him.

59:11.996 --> 59:14.950
He's too young to be punished
without any explanation.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.746
Then give him the explanation.

59:19.838 --> 59:22.411
Richard, you can't mean that.

59:23.300 --> 59:28.176
Richard, it doesn't concern him.
It's an issue between you and me.

59:28.264 --> 59:33.972
Norman adores you. You're the man he's
loved since the moment he opened his eyes.

59:34.063 --> 59:37.065
Can't you,
for the few days we're still together,

59:37.151 --> 59:41.778
at least show him the courtesy
you would show a... a head waiter?

59:41.865 --> 59:47.618
I'm sorry, Julia. You're asking me to do
something which involves character.

59:47.704 --> 59:52.082
As you have pointed out,
I am not a man of character.

59:52.168 --> 59:54.291
Please, Richard. Please.

59:54.378 --> 59:56.418
You're in my light, Julia.

59:56.505 --> 59:59.045
We made it, partner.
Three spades, doubled.

59:59.135 --> 01:00:01.507
Aren't we the lucky ones?

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:21.699
- How long will it take to get to Boston?
- Seven or eight hours, sir.

01:00:21.787 --> 01:00:28.039
There's a lot of traffic going out. Seems
like when we get to New York, everybody's...

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.291
planning to have a party.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:35.382
Yes, sir, about seven or eight hours.

01:00:35.468 --> 01:00:37.960
Well, I guess that'll be soon enough.

01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:41.803
That'll be 11 shillings, sir.
Shall I bill it to your cabin?

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:44.931
- Yes, sir?
- What time did this message come in?

01:00:45.023 --> 01:00:47.479
Phillips handled that one, sir.
He's at dinner.

01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:51.517
Check your log. This morning we got
an iceberg warning from the Baltic.

01:00:51.613 --> 01:00:54.734
Half an hour ago,
this one from the Caronia was delivered.

01:00:54.826 --> 01:00:59.203
- It came in at 7:40.
- But it's dated April 12th, two days ago.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:03.536
- Why the delay?
- Maybe something to do with transmission.

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:08.706
We got it half an hour ago
and sent it straight to the bridge.

01:01:19.813 --> 01:01:24.606
- Well, what did they say?
- Held up at the other end, sir.

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:46.546
Hello, Chief.
Thought you'd be having dinner.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.130
Finished, sir.

01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:51.175
Where's your plot on that iceberg
reported by the Baltic?

01:01:51.266 --> 01:01:54.852
Right here, sir.
Ahead, and slightly north of our track.

01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:57.062
We should sight it about 8am.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.561
Hm.

01:01:58.651 --> 01:02:02.484
Here's another report from the Caronia.
Plot it in, will you?

01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:07.033
42 north, 49-50 west.
That would put it up here, sir.

01:02:09.371 --> 01:02:12.041
But the Caronia report
was filed two days ago.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:15.375
That'd be about right.
There's a strong southerly drift.

01:02:15.462 --> 01:02:20.256
A large enough berg could have moved down
there, almost where the Baltic sighted it.

01:02:20.344 --> 01:02:24.258
- Do you want to alter course, sir?
- What's the weather forecast?

01:02:24.348 --> 01:02:26.637
Clear and calm.

01:02:27.852 --> 01:02:31.897
Oh, I don't think so.
No need to alter course yet.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:38.317
I'll be on the bridge during the morning
watch. Shouldn't be hard to spot in daylight.

01:02:42.995 --> 01:02:45.664
Mr Murdoch? I thought I'd let you know.

01:02:45.748 --> 01:02:52.083
The captain will be topside for
the morning watch. Night order book as is.

01:02:52.172 --> 01:02:55.458
- We're going to stay at 22 knots?
- Why not?

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.303
At 30, we couldn't reach
that berg before daylight.

01:02:58.387 --> 01:03:00.676
That's true. Not this one.

01:03:04.061 --> 01:03:08.013
But what if these
are two different icebergs?

01:03:17.369 --> 01:03:21.320
Oh, Amherst, brave Amherst

01:03:21.415 --> 01:03:25.283
'T was a name known to fame
in days of yore

01:03:25.378 --> 01:03:29.329
May it ever be glorious

01:03:29.425 --> 01:03:33.470
Till the sun shall climb
the heavens no more

01:03:33.555 --> 01:03:35.179
Boh-boh-boh-bom

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.218
Boh-boh-boh-bom

01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:41.307
Oh, Lord Jeffrey Amherst
was a soldier of the king

01:03:41.397 --> 01:03:45.230
And he came from across the sea

01:03:45.318 --> 01:03:49.019
To the Frenchmen and the Indians
he didn't do a thing

01:03:49.114 --> 01:03:53.196
In the wilds of this wild country

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:57.361
In the wilds of this wild country

01:03:57.457 --> 01:04:01.207
And for his royal majesty
he fought with all his might

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:05.210
He was a soldier loyal and true

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.133
And he conquered all of the enemies
that came within his sight

01:04:09.222 --> 01:04:13.220
And he looked around for more
when he was through

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.356
Oh, Amherst, brave Amherst

01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:21.355
'T was a name known to fame
in days of yore

01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:25.360
May it ever be glorious

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:29.399
Till the sun
shall climb the heavens no more

01:04:40.634 --> 01:04:46.507
Should be seeing gulls by morning. The birds
of the Grand Banks fair chilled with courage.

01:04:49.436 --> 01:04:53.481
Overtrumped.
Never send a baby to buy the beer.

01:04:56.027 --> 01:05:01.568
Far above Cayuga's waters

01:05:01.658 --> 01:05:06.405
With its waves of blue

01:05:06.498 --> 01:05:11.493
Stands our noble alma mater

01:05:11.587 --> 01:05:17.507
Glorious to view

01:05:17.594 --> 01:05:22.091
Lift the chorus, speed it homeward

01:05:22.183 --> 01:05:27.096
Loud her praises tell

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:33.394
Hail to thee, O alma mater

01:05:33.488 --> 01:05:39.610
Hail, all hail, Cornell

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:45.792
Far above the busy humming

01:05:45.877 --> 01:05:49.923
Of the bustling town

01:05:50.008 --> 01:05:56.212
Reared against the arch of heaven

01:05:56.306 --> 01:06:00.969
Looks she proudly down

01:06:02.146 --> 01:06:07.272
Lift the chorus, speed it homeward

01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:12.190
Loud her praises tell

01:06:12.284 --> 01:06:14.776
What a lot of songs they know.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:19.200
It's only a few.
There must be hundreds more.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:24.457
- Hail, all hail, Cornell
- Fifty, anyway.

01:07:27.039 --> 01:07:29.115
Jesus Mary!

01:07:32.253 --> 01:07:34.377
Iceberg, dead ahead!

01:07:35.174 --> 01:07:37.332
Iceberg, dead ahead, sir!

01:07:42.015 --> 01:07:44.767
Hard a-starboard! Full speed astern!

01:07:44.851 --> 01:07:47.141
Hard a-starboard, sir.

01:07:52.653 --> 01:07:54.195
Helm hard a-starboard, sir.

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:06.368
Keep the helm hard over.
We're going to clear.

01:08:26.191 --> 01:08:30.106
For once again comes Williams' day

01:08:30.196 --> 01:08:33.732
Yard by yard we'll fight our way

01:08:33.826 --> 01:08:37.160
Through Amherst's line

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:40.580
Every man in every play

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.875
Striving all the time

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:47.712
Cheer on cheer will rend the air

01:08:47.801 --> 01:08:50.506
All behind our men

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:19.535
Iceberg, sir.
We must have picked up a spur.

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:53.910
It's over there.

01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:06.347
We must have come close.

01:10:08.063 --> 01:10:10.389
Did we hit it?

01:10:10.483 --> 01:10:12.974
No, sir. It hit us.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.454
No damage above the waterline, sir, but
the forepeak is flooded to the orlop deck.

01:10:24.539 --> 01:10:29.453
Water in the fireman's passage port side.
Additional damage abaft of bulkhead B.

01:10:29.546 --> 01:10:32.916
Damage that far aft? Check again.

01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:34.338
All right, I'll tell him.

01:10:34.427 --> 01:10:38.840
We're taking water in number 1, 2 and 3 holds,
and number 5 and 6 boiler rooms.

01:10:38.932 --> 01:10:44.686
- Can they shore up?
- No, sir. Ripped us like a tin opener.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.571
Tell the chief engineer
to start the forward pumps. Wilde.

01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:55.029
Start the forward pumps!

01:10:58.498 --> 01:11:01.997
Order all hands to stations.
Passengers and crew don lifejackets.

01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:05.786
Prepare to lower away all boats.

01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:14.763
Captain Smith?

01:11:16.394 --> 01:11:20.439
Break off traffic, and get him up.
Stand by to send out a CQD to all vessels.

01:11:20.524 --> 01:11:23.727
- I'll send you the position.
- CQD, sir? That's Full Distress.

01:11:23.819 --> 01:11:27.770
We've struck an iceberg.
We're going down.

01:11:29.242 --> 01:11:33.370
- Captain, I want to know what's happening.
- There's been some underwater damage.

01:11:33.454 --> 01:11:38.532
- You can trust me, Captain. Is it critical?
- Give us a hand with this cover!

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:42.044
Over here, mate!
Call up boat crew six!

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:45.134
To be on the safe side,
we're clearing away the boats.

01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:49.383
Captain, I will not be put off.
Is this ship going to sink?

01:11:50.433 --> 01:11:55.641
She is. I'm ordering
all women and children into the boats.

01:11:55.731 --> 01:12:00.690
As for the rest of us...
perhaps some vessel can get to us in time.

01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:09.195
Captain Smith, in other words,
there aren't enough lifeboats for the men.

01:12:31.775 --> 01:12:35.025
All passengers go to their cabins
and put on life jackets.

01:12:35.111 --> 01:12:37.270
There is no cause for alarm.

01:12:37.364 --> 01:12:39.690
You'll find life jackets
in your wardrobe.

01:12:39.784 --> 01:12:42.820
Please proceed to your cabins immediately.

01:12:42.912 --> 01:12:48.998
Put on your life jackets and proceed
to the promenade deck via the after ladder.

01:12:58.931 --> 01:13:02.881
Did you hear what happened? We ran
into an iceberg, and none of us even saw it.

01:13:02.977 --> 01:13:05.468
I knew there was something.
Norman, get dressed.

01:13:05.563 --> 01:13:09.776
Please relax. I've talked to the captain.
There was a collision of sorts.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.861
They evidently felt they needed
to break the monotony.

01:13:12.947 --> 01:13:16.152
- Is there any danger?
- Danger? On a ship like this?

01:13:16.244 --> 01:13:19.696
Nonsense. However,
we have to follow instructions.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:24.037
Now, put on warm things, everybody -
comfortable, but as becoming as possible.

01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:26.999
Annette, get the other jackets
from in there.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:31.918
It might be a good idea to bring blankets.
It may be chilly in the lifeboats.

01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:34.586
Lifeboats? And you say there's no danger?

01:13:34.682 --> 01:13:38.016
Julia, I'm afraid you don't understand
the corporate mind.

01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.345
Steamship companies serve the public.

01:13:40.438 --> 01:13:44.188
To prove they're on the job,
they like to inconvenience people.

01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:46.565
Here, Julia. Help Norman.

01:13:47.613 --> 01:13:51.363
I imagine they'll row us out a few hundred
yards while they repair the damage.

01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:55.615
All right, Julia.
We're assigned to number six lifeboat.

01:13:55.706 --> 01:13:58.198
Remember, number six.

01:13:58.293 --> 01:14:00.785
Well, I believe we're ready.

01:14:01.922 --> 01:14:05.506
Norman, you'd better take these. Catch.

01:14:07.596 --> 01:14:09.672
Father?

01:14:11.641 --> 01:14:14.596
Haven't you forgotten something too?

01:14:14.687 --> 01:14:16.763
So I have.

01:14:19.442 --> 01:14:22.278
I pay $1,000 to ride
in the greatest ship ever built,

01:14:22.362 --> 01:14:26.232
and then somebody pokes a hole in it.
Why don't they patch it up?

01:14:26.327 --> 01:14:30.740
Don't walk out on me. I was just getting some
good cards. We're going on with that game.

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:36.788
Don't worry, Mrs Young. When we get back,
the cards will still be warm.

01:14:40.801 --> 01:14:47.305
Put on that jacket, please!
Don't push, please! Don't push, please!

01:14:47.393 --> 01:14:52.270
- Annette! Annette!
- Tie on that jacket, sir, please.

01:14:52.358 --> 01:14:57.019
Tie yours up, sir. Take it quietly, madam.
Don't push, please. Don't push!

01:14:59.824 --> 01:15:01.568
Number four boat, swing out.

01:15:01.659 --> 01:15:07.199
Number two crew, see your boat's clear
of the ship's side before you lower away.

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:10.626
- There's nobody to man this boat.
- There's a crew on its way up.

01:15:10.712 --> 01:15:12.669
Keep your people together.

01:15:12.756 --> 01:15:18.048
Find your proper boat!
Them to starboard's odd, them to port's even.

01:15:18.137 --> 01:15:22.265
- Is there any way I can help, sir?
- You can see that this passage is kept clear.

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:26.598
Stand back, everybody, and keep together!
Are all your people with you?

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:30.769
Yes, they're all here.
On second thought, I have some stragglers.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:34.029
- Wait here. I'll be back shortly.
- You can't leave us now.

01:15:34.115 --> 01:15:35.526
I'll be back.

01:15:35.617 --> 01:15:38.618
Can you use your influence?
Do you know what's going on?

01:15:38.703 --> 01:15:42.239
- Stand back! Keep the passage clear.
- You're Mrs Sturges?

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:44.575
They say it's nothing, but they're lying.

01:15:44.669 --> 01:15:50.375
And now somebody says there aren't
enough lifeboats for the men.

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:57.764
Richard! I see they got you into one of those.
This doesn't fit.

01:15:57.851 --> 01:16:00.093
- I may need you.
- It can't be that bad.

01:16:00.187 --> 01:16:05.894
I'm afraid it is. We may be having sand
for supper tonight. Come on.

01:16:16.497 --> 01:16:20.199
Leave everything behind!
Go up by the after deck. Come on!

01:16:20.294 --> 01:16:24.541
Please, put on your life belts!
Go up by the after deck!

01:16:24.632 --> 01:16:27.753
- You must take a life belt.
- Can't you get some order here?

01:16:27.845 --> 01:16:30.383
They won't go.
We can't make them understand.

01:16:30.472 --> 01:16:33.473
Give me a try here.
Attenzione tutti!

01:16:33.559 --> 01:16:36.680
Mrs Uzcadum...

01:16:37.772 --> 01:16:40.181
- Get to your feet!
- No, no. Safer place.

01:16:40.276 --> 01:16:43.112
I am at the moment
the head of this family. Now, get up!

01:16:43.196 --> 01:16:49.485
Non correte! Andate adesso alla scala
di fronte. Le donne e i bambini per primi.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.371
La scala di fronte...

01:16:57.212 --> 01:17:00.962
Remain on this deck.
The boats will be lowered down.

01:17:01.051 --> 01:17:03.624
I don't think it's so serious.
We'll get help.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.550
I think so too.

01:17:04.637 --> 01:17:08.055
I'll bet there are practically
seven or eight ships coming right now.

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:14.514
But, anyway, just in case we get on different
boats and you get to New York first...

01:17:14.609 --> 01:17:18.309
- would you mind calling home for me?
- Of course not. They'll be worried.

01:17:18.404 --> 01:17:21.323
There's just Jackie - that's my kid sister.

01:17:21.408 --> 01:17:26.284
You can tell her I didn't win any medal,
but that I bought her a pocketbook instead.

01:17:26.371 --> 01:17:30.584
- With beads on it.
- Keep your falls clear!

01:17:30.668 --> 01:17:34.881
- It was supposed to get there for Easter.
- You'll be there to tell her, Giff.

01:17:34.965 --> 01:17:39.427
- You're just as apt to be there before me.
- Oh, sure.

01:17:39.513 --> 01:17:43.593
But even if not,
there's one thing I want you to know.

01:17:43.683 --> 01:17:46.472
I don't think you'll believe it.

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:51.391
But I wouldn't have missed this boat trip,
not for anything.

01:17:57.576 --> 01:18:01.112
Officer.
Officer, have you room here for four more?

01:18:01.206 --> 01:18:05.204
- I think so. Are they assigned to this boat?
- They are now. Go ahead, Mrs Uzcadum.

01:18:05.293 --> 01:18:09.422
Here's a nice lady. She'll take care of you.

01:18:10.466 --> 01:18:15.128
- Bon voyage, Madeleine, my dear.
- Bless you, Richard.

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.771
Stand back there.

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:30.273
- Hop in for you, lad.
- Take a turn on that line!

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:34.113
Keep your falls clear!
Keep your falls clear!

01:18:34.202 --> 01:18:38.414
- Some loose ends to take care of, Julia.
- Yes, I saw.

01:18:38.498 --> 01:18:41.951
They're loading your lifeboat.
I'd better go to my own.

01:18:42.045 --> 01:18:44.204
It's on the other side.

01:18:44.297 --> 01:18:49.007
It will be a long walk, Richard,
but... thank you for lying.

01:18:49.095 --> 01:18:52.713
I know you're trying to make it easy for us.

01:18:52.807 --> 01:18:56.178
This way is easier for me, too.

01:18:56.271 --> 01:19:00.434
Oh, Richard,
where did we miss out on each other?

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.525
I... I beg your pardon, sir.

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:11.825
I put you down as a useless man,
somebody to lead a cotillion.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.785
After all, it was my major talent.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.748
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:18.839 --> 01:19:21.045
Sorry about everything.

01:19:23.969 --> 01:19:28.348
We have no time to catalogue our regrets.

01:19:28.434 --> 01:19:32.479
All we can do
is pretend 20 years didn't happen.

01:19:33.522 --> 01:19:35.848
It's June again.

01:19:37.194 --> 01:19:41.939
You're walking under some elm trees
in a white muslin dress.

01:19:42.032 --> 01:19:45.402
The loveliest creature I ever laid eyes on.

01:19:45.495 --> 01:19:49.623
That summer, when I asked you to marry me,

01:19:49.707 --> 01:19:52.414
I pledged my eternal devotion.

01:19:54.088 --> 01:19:57.422
I would consider it a great favour, Julia,

01:19:57.509 --> 01:20:01.459
if you would accept
a restatement of that pledge.

01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:05.056
- Ohh!
- Number six boat ready to lower away.

01:20:05.143 --> 01:20:07.433
Please, madam.

01:20:09.232 --> 01:20:11.520
Go ahead, my dear.

01:20:15.823 --> 01:20:19.607
Hurry up! Number six boat
ready to lower away!

01:20:19.702 --> 01:20:22.408
Stand by your falls!

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.782
Come along, Annette.

01:20:26.835 --> 01:20:31.297
- Help your sister, Norman.
- Shouldn't I go on the boat with you?

01:20:31.383 --> 01:20:34.586
- The officer put you here, didn't he?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:34.678 --> 01:20:37.430
You know the rules.
A good soldier obeys orders.

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:40.089
- Yes, sir.
- Au revoir, my pet.

01:20:45.191 --> 01:20:51.526
You look fat and funny in those life jackets,
like Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

01:20:54.618 --> 01:20:57.987
Numbers four and six lifeboats,
stand by to lower away.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.082
All passengers to the promenade deck.

01:21:08.259 --> 01:21:11.842
Stand back, everybody, and keep together!

01:21:24.111 --> 01:21:27.612
Attention! Attention, all able-bodied men!

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:32.161
We need your help forward and aft,
as quickly as you can, please!

01:21:32.247 --> 01:21:35.782
Repairers, get over here at once. Over here!

01:21:36.126 --> 01:21:38.284
All right, men. This way.

01:21:39.004 --> 01:21:42.753
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:21:47.638 --> 01:21:52.018
Remain on this deck.
The boats will be lowered down.

01:21:52.103 --> 01:21:55.722
- Stand back!
- All right, give me one of them paddles.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.606
Over here, mates! Lend a hand. She's stuck!

01:21:58.694 --> 01:22:04.116
I want some of you men on the end of this
rope, the rest of you over on the other one.

01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:19.425
All women and children for lifeboat
number six, fasten your lifebelts, please.

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:23.461
Please see that your lifebelts are fastened.

01:22:26.602 --> 01:22:29.390
Fasten your life jacket, madam.

01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:35.145
- I'm sorry, ma'am. She's loaded.
- Where will I go, Officer?

01:22:35.237 --> 01:22:39.070
Well, there may be another boat forward.
There's no room in this.

01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:42.777
All right, now, don't crowd.
Stay in there.

01:22:42.872 --> 01:22:45.161
Here's a space.

01:22:53.425 --> 01:22:55.714
All right, lower away.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.515
Where's Norman?

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:09.606
Norman? Norman!

01:23:10.862 --> 01:23:13.104
He gave a woman up front his seat.

01:23:13.198 --> 01:23:16.117
Norman! Norman!

01:23:28.299 --> 01:23:31.920
There's a damn problem.
We're stuck in the block.

01:23:32.013 --> 01:23:35.217
She won't clear. Get a marlinespike.

01:23:37.144 --> 01:23:39.433
We'll never do it this way.

01:23:49.701 --> 01:23:55.206
Number ten is farther aft, sir.
Seaman on number four line, haul away.

01:24:48.562 --> 01:24:49.891
From the Carpathia, sir.

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:55.650
"We are coming full speed. 41 degrees 30
minutes north, 49 degrees 21 minutes west."

01:24:55.736 --> 01:24:57.316
Give me their position again.

01:24:57.406 --> 01:25:00.822
41 degrees 30 north,
49 degrees 21 west.

01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:12.705
Have Mr Lightoller pass the word
to the lifeboats. Steer east-southeast.

01:25:12.799 --> 01:25:15.503
They'll be picked up by dawn.

01:25:33.489 --> 01:25:36.491
We're clear, Officer.

01:25:36.576 --> 01:25:39.067
I think we have her repaired.

01:26:00.147 --> 01:26:02.815
- Can you still keep up steam?
- We'll try, sir.

01:26:02.899 --> 01:26:04.975
We need power for the Marconi instrument.

01:26:05.068 --> 01:26:09.150
And I want to keep the lights burning.
If there's a ship coming, she has to see us.

01:26:09.241 --> 01:26:11.115
Right, sir.

01:26:11.201 --> 01:26:14.238
I presume you know
you may not make it out of here.

01:26:14.329 --> 01:26:18.992
- Yes, sir. That's the way of it sometimes.
- Good luck.

01:26:47.827 --> 01:26:50.069
I see you made it, Mr Meeker.

01:27:23.453 --> 01:27:25.826
Oh, Norman.

01:27:25.915 --> 01:27:27.907
Oh, my little boy.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:35.751
- Steward! Mr Sturges. Have you seen him?
- No, I haven't.

01:27:51.402 --> 01:27:55.068
Number seven coxswain to starboard.

01:27:55.156 --> 01:27:59.784
Please sit down when you get in the boat.
Please keep still.

01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:05.164
Fasten your life jacket, please, ma'am.

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:14.387
Number three boiler room flooded.

01:28:16.182 --> 01:28:20.262
We're flooded to the after coal bunker, sir.
The bulkheads are about to go.

01:28:20.353 --> 01:28:24.268
We're finished when the water
hits the main boilers.

01:28:24.358 --> 01:28:27.145
Order all hands up from below.
Their duty's done.

01:28:27.237 --> 01:28:31.781
- Yes, sir.
- Mr McDermott's waiting amidships, sir.

01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:33.777
- What?
- Mr McDermott, sir.

01:28:33.869 --> 01:28:35.946
Oh... Yes.

01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:44.502
- You sent for us, sir?
- Yes. I think it might help if you'd play.

01:28:44.591 --> 01:28:45.789
Yes, sir.

01:28:45.883 --> 01:28:48.172
"Londonderry Air".

01:29:15.252 --> 01:29:18.836
Please sit down
the moment you get in the boat.

01:29:18.923 --> 01:29:22.043
Please sit down when you get in the boat.

01:29:22.135 --> 01:29:26.430
Take your places, please. And keep still.
Keep your hands on the inside!

01:29:26.515 --> 01:29:28.591
Mind your head.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.721
- All right, Mrs Straus.
- No, please.

01:29:33.815 --> 01:29:37.565
- Mrs Straus, this is the last lifeboat.
- Please, sir. I'm a very old lady.

01:29:37.653 --> 01:29:43.823
I've been with Mr Straus most of my life.
I will not leave him now.

01:29:44.995 --> 01:29:47.072
All right, ma'am.

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:54.373
Right, slack away your breast lines.

01:29:54.464 --> 01:29:57.252
Keep your hands inside the boat!

01:30:03.392 --> 01:30:06.393
Please sit still in the boat.
Fasten your life jacket there!

01:30:06.479 --> 01:30:08.768
Lower away!

01:30:22.957 --> 01:30:25.449
Look out! She's gonna blow!

01:30:53.201 --> 01:30:56.736
Don't go in! The starboard boiler's gone,
and the port one's about to go!

01:30:56.830 --> 01:31:00.081
- Are there men in there?
- A few, pinned under the rig.

01:31:00.167 --> 01:31:06.004
- For God's sake, mister, don't go in there!
- For God's sake, I am going in.

01:31:31.955 --> 01:31:34.244
Norman. Norman!

01:31:36.544 --> 01:31:39.581
What's happened? What are you doing here?

01:31:39.673 --> 01:31:42.757
- I was afraid I couldn't find you, sir.
- Come with me.

01:31:42.843 --> 01:31:48.550
On the lower decks! It won't do any good
to jump. The water's near freezing!

01:31:48.641 --> 01:31:50.349
Move aft! Move...

01:31:50.435 --> 01:31:53.520
Officer, this boy's still aboard.
Where are they loading?

01:31:53.606 --> 01:31:57.140
Sorry, sir. All the lifeboats have gone.

01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:01.982
Well, Norman...

01:32:03.034 --> 01:32:05.026
I didn't count on this.

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:08.619
All the other men were staying.
I thought perhaps I should too.

01:32:08.707 --> 01:32:11.494
I'm wearing long trousers, sir.

01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:15.754
I guess long trousers
is enough to prove you're a man.

01:32:15.839 --> 01:32:19.790
Just the same, you're sore at me
for coming back, aren't you, sir?

01:32:19.886 --> 01:32:24.265
Yes, I'm sore at you - the way I've always
been sore at those fool drummer boys

01:32:24.351 --> 01:32:27.055
who stayed on to play "Last Retreat".

01:32:28.104 --> 01:32:32.898
I... I thought maybe we could
make a swim of it, together.

01:32:33.945 --> 01:32:36.152
Well...

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.695
Whatever happens...

01:32:38.784 --> 01:32:41.073
I love you very much.

01:32:42.121 --> 01:32:45.954
I've been proud of you every day of your life,

01:32:46.043 --> 01:32:48.749
never as much as at this moment.

01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:53.290
I feel tall as a mountain.

01:32:57.265 --> 01:33:01.096
Mr Sturges? There's a boy up forward
looking for you, sir.

01:33:01.185 --> 01:33:04.140
Yes, Harry, I found him.

01:33:04.231 --> 01:33:06.520
He's my son.

01:33:13.158 --> 01:33:15.234
She won't spark.

01:33:21.626 --> 01:33:23.085
We're finished, mate.

01:33:30.803 --> 01:33:36.096
Mr Jackson, you will make
the last entry in the log and secure.

01:33:39.439 --> 01:33:44.945
At this hour,
all wireless communication broken off,

01:33:45.029 --> 01:33:48.648
all lifeboats manned and lowered away...

01:33:49.993 --> 01:33:52.948
This vessel sinking hard by the bow.

01:34:09.099 --> 01:34:14.474
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:34:14.564 --> 01:34:20.852
Nearer to thee

01:34:20.946 --> 01:34:26.867
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:32.743
Nearer to thee

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:38.625
E'en though it be a cross

01:34:38.717 --> 01:34:44.388
That raiseth me

01:34:44.474 --> 01:34:50.928
Still all my song shall be

01:34:51.023 --> 01:34:57.395
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:34:57.615 --> 01:35:03.785
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:35:03.872 --> 01:35:10.375
Nearer to thee

01:35:10.464 --> 01:35:16.170
Though like the wanderer

01:35:16.261 --> 01:35:22.098
The sun gone down

01:35:22.185 --> 01:35:28.059
Darkness be over me

01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:34.404
My rest a stone

01:35:34.492 --> 01:35:41.207
Yet in my dreams I'd be

01:35:41.291 --> 01:35:47.828
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:35:48.049 --> 01:35:54.088
Nearer, my God, to thee

01:35:54.181 --> 01:36:01.396
Nearer to thee

01:36:01.482 --> 01:36:07.153
Yet in my dreams I'd be

01:36:07.239 --> 01:36:14.287
Nearer, my God, to thee
