<i>Some things you look at
and you think, "Perfect.</i>

01:36.012 --> 01:40.975
<i>There is no question. It's just... right."</i>

01:42.602 --> 01:44.771
<i>Other things are clearly wrong.</i>

01:47.398 --> 01:50.777
<i>But right and wrong
aren't a P.I.'s highest priority</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:54.781
<i>until she gets the bright idea
to branch out and give a shit.</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:58.076
- Cassie Yasdan?
- Yeah?

01:59.410 --> 02:02.580
I'm Jessica Jones.
I'm taking you back to your mother.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.415
Hey. What the hell do you want?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.334
Just responding to an Amber Alert.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.877
Oh, she's not kidnapped. I'm her father.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.840
You lost custody.
Come on. Get your things.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.049
- Dad?
- Look...

02:13.133 --> 02:16.886
I... I had a crap-ass lawyer
and a vindictive ex-wife.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.596
Now, you're a criminal,

02:18.680 --> 02:21.891
taking a minor out of the country,
forging documents.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.395
I had to get Cassie away from her mother.
She's toxic.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.689
Wow. You're the first ex-husband
to ever say that.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.150
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm staying with my dad.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.695
He's the bad guy.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.238
Yeah, says my ex-wife.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.323
Says the law, asshole.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.868
The US law. We're not in the US.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.035
We're about to be.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.621
Hey, look, don't make me get physical.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.877
Dude, quit messing around.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.817
Aren't superheroes
supposed to save people?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.944
Captain America
would never have done this.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.279
Cassie! Sweetheart!

03:16.362 --> 03:19.574
Oh! I was so worried. Thank you so much.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.326
Yeah, thanks.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.119
What...

03:23.953 --> 03:26.748
He's made me the bad cop again.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.167
She'll come around.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.921
Yeah, after I put his ass in jail.
And the hell if I'll let her visit him.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.255
Um...

03:35.715 --> 03:40.011
it would probably be easier on Cassie
if you just let it go.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.013
You think I'm hard on her?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.432
The situation is hard.

03:44.515 --> 03:49.562
So you're a hero and a child psychologist?
You think you can judge me?

03:49.646 --> 03:50.980
I'm beginning to.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.316
After you weaseled a free trip
to Mexico out of me?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.860
Real noble,
taking advantage of a single mom.

03:55.944 --> 04:01.324
Your sliding scale fee just slid to zero,
you third-rate Joan Jett wannabe!

04:09.374 --> 04:10.750
<i>I hate heroism.</i>

04:13.461 --> 04:15.463
You got 30,000 views.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.050
<i>Holy shit!</i>

04:19.132 --> 04:21.761
<i>Did you see that? Who is that chick?</i>

04:21.844 --> 04:22.844
Great.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.557
I know. Was the girl okay? Was she hurt?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.268
She was on her way to a sunburn.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.394
But you saved her?

04:30.478 --> 04:33.648
From her dad?
Yeah, Vido, I saved the girl.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.525
Wish I had been there.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.403
You would've taken a better video.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.741
Me, too. I used to hang
with some bad company.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.578
No, not a gang, but there was
this one really controlling person.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.331
- No.
- It's the same color, sans the fleas.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.499
Get rid of it.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.628
No, this person didn't want to kill me...
that I know of.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.880
Very passive-aggressive, though.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.469
Okay, it is different,

05:03.553 --> 05:07.432
but my point is is that some people
feel threatened by change.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.227
It is comfortable.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.437
It's going away.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.813
Hold on a sec.

05:13.896 --> 05:17.233
Ex-gang member trying to start over,
but the gang thinks otherwise.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.526
Sliding scale?

05:18.609 --> 05:22.322
Why do they even call it that?
It's pro bono. Zero money.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.781
You could beat up a whole gang.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.618
Put him on the list.

05:28.494 --> 05:32.290
Mateo, email me your information.
I'm Gillian.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.625
You've got a hero on your side now.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.294
I told you to stop saying that.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.630
And yet I continue to say it. Weird, huh?

05:40.506 --> 05:43.926
Your docket is empty.
The wait list is growing. Pick one.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.139
Can any of them pay full freight?

05:48.222 --> 05:50.183
Sure, 'cause helpless people
are always rich.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.977
- You choose.
- I don't care enough.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.688
I'll choose. Gimme.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.362
Four-fifty-nine. Shift's over.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.631
I'm busy this weekend,
so you won't be able to reach me.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.824
I never want to reach you.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.992
You working a case?

06:08.076 --> 06:11.245
I'm working a mimosa over brunch,
then a play, game night.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.373
- I'm a people person.
- You really aren't.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.749
You're hardly the arbiter.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.001
Five. Exactly.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.961
Couch stays.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.923
Asshole.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.510
Why don't you just fire her?
You don't even like her.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.762
That's why I keep her around.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.139
Makes it easier
to maintain a healthy distance.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.223
Is that good?

06:32.350 --> 06:33.393
It works.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.145
With everyone but me.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.107
Don't press your luck, kid.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.194
Gotta go. Friday family dinner.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.405
You can come.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.490
I got work to do.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.492
I like numbers two and six.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.505
<i>Giving a shit
and doing something about it.</i>

07:05.341 --> 07:07.844
<i>That's how my mother defined a hero.</i>

07:09.929 --> 07:12.014
<i>Though she wasn't exactly an expert.</i>

07:14.100 --> 07:16.185
<i>She thought I had what it takes.</i>

07:18.229 --> 07:19.439
<i>I am not so sure.</i>

07:21.774 --> 07:24.152
<i>She had... hope.</i>

07:25.403 --> 07:29.866
<i>I didn't want it, but she passed it
down to me like a trick elbow.</i>

07:31.534 --> 07:33.744
<i>And now it's the only thing
I have of hers.</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:12.158
Here.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.241
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.621
Mrs. Chin move out?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.707
To a retirement community. I upgraded.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.295
- Babe, is that the dessert?
- Yeah. Zaya, you remember Jessica.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.255
Oh, yeah, from next door. Hi.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.550
Well, have a good night.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.678
The cookies have landed!

08:33.929 --> 08:35.597
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.760
<i>With a loss
of seven on that sack, it's the second...</i>

08:44.440 --> 08:45.858
Channel 782.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.530
The customer is always right.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.490
Only if they tip well.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.494
<i>It has the vintage look
of a classic wood-burning stove</i>

08:56.577 --> 08:59.163
<i>but fits seamlessly with any modern decor.</i>

08:59.247 --> 09:02.250
<i>And it's completely electric,
which blows my mind,</i>

09:02.333 --> 09:04.043
<i>because this fire looks so real</i>

09:04.126 --> 09:08.589
<i>and yet the heat is completely adjustable
with this handy remote.</i>

09:08.673 --> 09:10.353
<i>That's right.
Now, those are...</i>

09:10.383 --> 09:11.717
I see you got here early.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.971
I had work to avoid.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.558
Speaking of,
let me buy you yet another drink.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
You saved the girl.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.148
Is that what I did?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.110
The mom called and said
you got her daughter back.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.654
I'm guessing she said
a lot more than that.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.533
She may have referred to you
as part of the, uh, female anatomy.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.702
Feeling's mutual.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.123
Nobody forced the case on you.
I just mentioned it in passing.

09:42.206 --> 09:46.127
Next time, in passing,
maybe mention someone worth helping.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.588
Assholes need saving, too...

09:50.381 --> 09:51.549
from bigger assholes.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.259
It's a sliding scale.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.013
You could stop.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.558
Maybe leave the heroics
to, uh, trained professionals

10:00.641 --> 10:03.728
who are committed to the rule of law
and subject to oversight.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.692
Is that why you came here, Detective?
To tell me to stop?

10:10.234 --> 10:13.529
I wanted to restate
the terms of our agreement.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.533
I throw you a case or two,
and you don't break the law.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.617
That was the deal.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.579
Our deal was to not let you
catch me breaking the law.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.750
It's kind of hard to look
the other way when you have 80,000 hits.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.211
It's entertaining, but it's assault.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.923
It's out of your jurisdiction, Costa.

10:35.217 --> 10:39.263
Just keep your eye on the line.
Don't go over it.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.684
Russell knows I'm meeting you.

10:44.268 --> 10:48.356
He, uh...
he made me promise to come home sober.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.359
What a good guy you are.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.736
I know.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.366
Lucky you.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.909
Hello, Jess.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.007
Do you want to leave down the elevator
or out the window?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.717
I want to hire you.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.313
Trish is missing.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.939
Call someone who gives a shit.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.609
Oh, for God's sake. Let me just explain.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.613
You want to hit me?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.657
Go ahead if it'll get you to listen.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.336
I don't want to be here
any more than you want me here.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.506
But 24 hours ago,
Trish just fell off the map.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.634
What a hideous piece of furniture.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.052
I love it.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.720
Well, I should have seen it coming.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.265
She's been late for appointments,
distracted...

13:29.225 --> 13:31.143
out all night, she won't say where.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.188
But she has never missed work
until yesterday.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.942
She could be using again,
or in danger or worse.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.111
If that's what Trish wants to do,
then that's her business.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.155
I will pay you.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.365
No.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.866
Please.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.244
Something's wrong.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.537
No.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.999
I have no one else to go to.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.210
The police would be an obvious choice.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.215
But you're afraid that would get out.
Always protecting her brand.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.009
Yes, because that's all I can do.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.429
But you can do more. A lot more.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.225
You explained. I listened. Get out.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.354
I know something happened
between the two of you

14:15.437 --> 14:17.606
around your mother's death,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.859
but Trish had nothing to do with that.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.652
Don't talk about my mother.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.571
Ever.

14:23.654 --> 14:27.491
I understand. Family is family.

14:27.575 --> 14:31.328
But Trish is your family, too.
Nothing can undo that.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.083
You have a chance to save her life.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.547
Been there, done that.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.340
Get out.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.181
Trish was the only good thing about you.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.779
Alias Inve...

15:06.864 --> 15:09.033
Alias Inve...

15:10.826 --> 15:12.244
Hello? What?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.954
<i>Take me off the speakerphone.</i>

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
Just talk, Hogarth.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.462
<i>I need you.</i>

15:26.258 --> 15:27.259
Hogarth?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.344
I'm in here!

15:34.683 --> 15:38.312
If we're doing another favor swap,
there's a video I'm gonna need taken down.

15:38.812 --> 15:42.066
The beach toss. Certainly not the image
you're trying to convey.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.360
Yeah, it was taken out of context.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.445
I'll look into a cease and desist.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.198
I'm glad to see you're still committed
to your new aspirations.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.158
- I am relying on that.
- For?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.497
A lot of people rely on me now,
so cut to the chase.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.248
This...

16:00.250 --> 16:02.878
is my plan for the future...

16:03.796 --> 16:06.882
so that my life doesn't end
in pain and indignity.

16:07.341 --> 16:11.345
Every day, I wake up and I ask myself,
"Is this the day that I take these?"

16:12.221 --> 16:14.890
The answer has been no,
until this morning.

16:16.350 --> 16:20.396
I felt the first significant symptoms
of the ALS.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.655
So, do you need something?

16:31.240 --> 16:34.576
The symptoms passed. Today isn't the day.

16:37.496 --> 16:42.167
But, uh, what it made me realize
is that when that day comes, I am...

16:44.670 --> 16:47.506
not gonna be able to do it.
I don't have it in me.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.803
I am going to need someone
that I can rely on

16:53.512 --> 16:56.807
to slip me the pills without me knowing.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.646
- I need a friend, Jessica.
- We're friends?

17:04.189 --> 17:07.067
Okay. Name your price.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.359
Why ask me?

17:08.902 --> 17:11.446
Because of your ability
to make hard choices.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.452
Like killing someone.
I've done it before, so it should be easy?

17:16.535 --> 17:20.497
Those were different circumstances.
I am asking you to do this.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.062
Ice or no ice?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.149
No ice.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.321
So how does this work?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.575
The time comes
that you're sick enough to die...

17:57.159 --> 17:58.327
What? Do you tell me?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.329
I can't know it's coming.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.793
So I just drop by one day
and I think, "Wow, Jeri looks like shit."

18:06.335 --> 18:09.046
Or, "Jeri's speech is slurred."

18:10.089 --> 18:13.801
"Well, she just dropped that glass."
What's my cue?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.012
You follow your instincts.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.641
Well, maybe my instincts
tell me it's now.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.975
Don't mock me.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.021
You just look the other way.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.982
Go on, look over there.
You'll never even see it coming.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.612
Stop it. These are hard to get.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.823
- How many do you think it would take?
- I don't know.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.452
If it's too many,
it would blow the surprise.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.830
And not enough,

18:42.913 --> 18:44.974
you'll probably just puke it up,
but if you're lucky,

18:44.998 --> 18:46.478
maybe you'll choke on your own vomit.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.793
What, you think this is funny?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.063
- Give it a test run.
- You don't know what this is like!

18:50.087 --> 18:52.172
- You have no idea! Stop!
- I gotta get it right.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.982
This isn't what I planned
for myself.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.568
I had people around me.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.029
No one can plan for this.

19:19.241 --> 19:24.663
I need to get ready for work.
I will, uh, look into the video.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.583
It's okay. I'll deal.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.126
I'll take care of it.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.828
- God damn it.
- Hey.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.039
You all right? You need an ambulance?

20:07.122 --> 20:08.707
No, just a new pair of pants.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.084
Okay, still, you should
get that checked out.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.252
I'm okay.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.463
No thanks to that drunk asshole.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.508
He jumped the curb, comes right at me,
and wasn't even looking up.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.093
I think he was jerking off.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.221
Jesus.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.944
He should be in jail.
Or thrown out of professional baseball.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.225
You know who that is?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.352
That's Cody Willamet.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.475
So I'm guessing
you're gonna want to sue him, right?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.272
Someone's gotta teach him a lesson.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.401
He will not learn it,
and you will be eaten alive.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.654
He's rich. He's famous.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.823
Plus, the team has
the best lawyer in New York.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.284
I should know. I work for her.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.704
- Shit. He said he was calling the police.
- He called my employer.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.706
He can't do this to people.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.999
Actually, he can.

20:52.417 --> 20:56.296
However, there is at least one thing
that you can get out of this.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.674
The keys are still in the ignition.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.427
Take it to Juan's Auto Body off the BQE.
Tell 'em Malcolm Ducasse sent you.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.222
- I'm not gonna steal the dude's car.
- It's not his car.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.099
Not anymore.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.481
Hey, man. Shit's messed up.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.568
- Sign this.
- What are you doing?

21:18.652 --> 21:21.822
It's a transfer of title. Sign it.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.002
It's all yours...

21:35.085 --> 21:39.756
if you can agree
to keep this incident to yourself.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.426
Sure, yeah. I agree.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.386
In writing, please.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.519
Hey, it wasn't my fault.
The guy came out of nowhere.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.521
You said that the last two times.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.233
Shit.

21:59.651 --> 22:03.030
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry, man. It won't happen again.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.908
Thank you, buddy.
You're doing God's work, man.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.837
<i>Just two AA batteries are all you need</i>

23:00.921 --> 23:04.216
<i>for these festive lanterns
to light up your next backyard cookout.</i>

23:04.299 --> 23:06.468
<i>Aren't these just precious?</i>

23:07.135 --> 23:10.597
<i>This would add a touch
of fairy-tale romance to any decor.</i>

23:11.306 --> 23:14.184
<i>And we've got the classic white, the...</i>

23:18.105 --> 23:22.192
She's not missing, per se.
I'm just asking if you've seen her.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.735
I'm planning a surprise.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.862
- <i>A surprise?</i>
- Yeah, a goddamn surprise.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.947
<i>That's baloney.</i>

23:27.030 --> 23:29.430
Well, fine, you're not invited.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.159
Trish?

23:31.243 --> 23:35.247
<i>Text me her credit card numbers
and bills, the last person who saw her.</i>

23:35.330 --> 23:36.330
Jessie?

23:36.748 --> 23:38.125
Amelia Earhart.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.627
<i>Names and contacts of her friends at work.</i>

23:40.710 --> 23:42.671
Oh, thank God.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.132
<i>You do that.</i>

23:45.215 --> 23:47.217
Are her security door codes
still the same?

23:47.300 --> 23:49.678
She doesn't have a security door
at her new place.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.012
She moved?

23:51.096 --> 23:54.975
<i>She sold her condo
and everything else she owned.</i>

23:57.018 --> 23:58.228
Text me her address.

23:58.311 --> 24:02.566
Well, I've got a key.
I'll meet you there in... in an hour?

24:02.649 --> 24:03.733
In the morning.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.027
Thank you.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.489
Just bring a big fat check.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.032
Friends and family discount?

24:11.616 --> 24:14.369
- Sleep it off.
- <i>You sleep it off.</i>

24:23.253 --> 24:25.881
<i>Taking a life changes a person.</i>

24:27.257 --> 24:28.925
<i>It definitely changed me.</i>

24:29.968 --> 24:32.179
<i>Looks like it changed Trish, too.</i>

24:38.810 --> 24:40.187
You're late, as usual.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.316
You're a boil on humanity's ass, as usual.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.736
We should get to work.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.571
Um, "we"?

24:50.113 --> 24:52.365
I don't know
why she chose this rathole.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.617
It's a dump.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.288
Even after I rescued her career,
she refused to leave.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.457
Said it suits her needs.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.085
When did she become such a slob?

25:13.094 --> 25:14.804
She's educating herself.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.516
- About what?
- Everything.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.226
Well, that's good, right?

25:30.111 --> 25:31.363
Maybe it's a man.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.282
Men always muck things up.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.660
No man.

25:36.743 --> 25:41.665
A woman? That'd be a relief.
And very au courant.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.668
She traded her Cal King
for a single futon.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.087
She doesn't want anybody
getting too comfortable.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.091
She's hiding out.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.218
Where?

25:55.262 --> 25:56.263
Here.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.725
Well, at least she's keeping fit.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.233
Blood.

26:08.858 --> 26:12.279
What? Oh, my God. Oh, God.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.240
- What does that mean?
- It means shut up.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.751
Oh, I tried that already. It's locked.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.380
I'm in.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.675
You know her password.

26:35.594 --> 26:40.974
I'm with her all the time now,
but I know her less than ever.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.519
I used to be jealous of you.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.688
Oh, yeah.

26:47.272 --> 26:52.235
You two were closer
than any two blood sisters I'd ever seen.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.113
You were her protector.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.409
She was your conscience.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.288
You must miss that.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.505
Rude!

27:19.638 --> 27:25.101
<i>Trish sees things
in black and white, right and wrong.</i>

27:26.186 --> 27:28.521
<i>Or... she used to.</i>

27:29.397 --> 27:32.651
<i>Maybe now she asks herself
the same question I do...</i>

27:33.234 --> 27:35.070
<i>"Who the hell am I to judge?"</i>

27:35.153 --> 27:39.324
<i>My answer is a fifth of whiskey.
What's Trish's answer?</i>

27:40.158 --> 27:41.785
<i>And where did she go to find it?</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:26.556
<i>Why is she staying here?</i>

29:45.909 --> 29:48.787
<i>Trish has everything she needs
for a stakeout.</i>

29:55.210 --> 29:57.212
<i>What is she looking for?</i>

30:02.133 --> 30:03.760
<i>And who is she watching?</i>

30:22.779 --> 30:26.407
- Ah. Is your boss in?
- She's waiting on a video conference.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.492
Thanks.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.088
- Got it.
- What?

30:41.256 --> 30:44.509
A nondisclosure agreement
from the latest guy Cody almost killed.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.593
Good.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.852
I just put an entitled drunk
back on the road.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.327
I'm not sure that qualifies as good.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.932
Okay. Effective.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.102
My job title is "Investigator,"
not "Fixer."

30:54.185 --> 30:57.313
Well, I hired both.
If you don't like the job anymore, leave.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.775
- Wow. Good to know.
- Okay, what I meant

31:00.859 --> 31:04.362
was that you are good at both.
And I need both.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.531
Lean into your potential.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.741
What you meant was,
"Shit or get off the pot."

31:08.825 --> 31:10.493
Like I said, you're good at this.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.873
Look, I'm willing to pay my dues.
I just want to make sure this is worth it.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.036
Well, with the experience you get here,
along with my eventual recommendation,

31:18.084 --> 31:19.836
you'll be able to launch
your own P.I. firm.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.756
Excuse me, Jeri.
I just looked over the Bauer case.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.551
They need to know if we're in or out.
I think it's a winner.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.345
Run with it.
This firm could use some wins right now.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.139
I'll get into it.

31:36.769 --> 31:38.771
She'll have her name
on that door before long.

31:40.356 --> 31:42.191
Malcolm, you are a valuable employee,

31:42.275 --> 31:44.277
but I don't want to have
this conversation again.

31:45.194 --> 31:49.240
You need to decide what you actually want
and then reconcile it however you can.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.416
They're ready in London.

31:58.499 --> 32:03.004
Char, uh, this benefit concert tonight,

32:03.087 --> 32:06.799
make a platinum-level donation and then
put the address in my calendar, please.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.260
String quartet. Sounds nice.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.471
- Just trying to do some good.
- Hmm.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.449
<i>Half of my job is about waiting.</i>

32:33.618 --> 32:34.911
<i>For a clue.</i>

32:36.245 --> 32:37.580
<i>For the truth.</i>

32:39.791 --> 32:42.627
<i>For a clear sign that I'm not wasting
my goddamn time.</i>

32:46.839 --> 32:49.050
<i>I'm not really sure
what I'm waiting for now.</i>

33:11.531 --> 33:12.699
Here we go.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.249
Wait. Where are you going?

34:07.754 --> 34:08.755
Jesus.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.056
Get the hell out of there.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.670
You're that powered chick from the video.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.803
Get out of my way!

34:59.097 --> 35:00.807
- Stay down.
- Like hell I will!

35:01.849 --> 35:03.059
Are you crazy?

35:48.646 --> 35:51.149
- What the hell?
- I didn't need you to save me.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.192
Except when you had a gun
pointed at your head.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.736
- Or are you bulletproof, too?
- No.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.197
Thanks. That clears things up.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.574
I'm late for work.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.909
As what? Are you a cat burglar?

36:02.451 --> 36:04.704
Excuse me, a super cat burglar?

36:04.787 --> 36:08.541
I wasn't stealing. I was getting justice.
Or trying to.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.126
So...

36:11.377 --> 36:14.005
Karl's near-fatal experiment worked.

36:14.088 --> 36:17.008
I would have told you earlier
if you'd returned any of my calls.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.635
You know why I didn't.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.221
You let that prick get away.

36:22.305 --> 36:25.266
There is a sculpture in his safe
that would have linked him to an assault.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.469
The safe with the gun in it?

36:26.517 --> 36:29.312
Yes. That's why I triggered the alarm.
I knew he'd go for his gun.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.564
That is the most moronic plan
I have ever heard.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.941
I have been tracking
that asshole for weeks.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.903
And... Now he's gone.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.780
So maybe it is better
if you just stay out of the way.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.075
Why? Because you're a hero now?

36:43.159 --> 36:44.493
Yes.

36:44.577 --> 36:48.623
The world's moral compass
who knows good from bad?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.210
Maybe.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.505
And now, I am finally equipped
to do something about it.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.175
So it was worth it, then.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.137
What you did to me.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.098
Because you got what you wanted.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.518
You don't get it, Jess. You're free.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.688
You always said
you didn't ask for this, but I did.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.734
So you can stop trying,
and feeling guilty and inadequate.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.737
I don't need you to be a hero.
Nobody does.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.240
I've got it covered.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.621
Your mother is looking for you.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.998
Call her so I can get paid.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.465
I'm so sorry.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.552
- Cody... Cody, you can't do that.
- Come on.

37:45.972 --> 37:50.059
- Cody. Cody, you're drunk.
- Would you just lighten up?

37:50.142 --> 37:51.769
Come on, give me your keys.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.314
Am I your bitch?
Do I look like somebody's bitch?

37:55.398 --> 37:56.399
Get in the car.

37:56.941 --> 37:57.942
Screw you.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.445
Screw me? Screw you.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.706
<i>Now, I want to share with you</i>

39:23.736 --> 39:26.364
<i>one of my favorite pieces
from the collection.</i>

39:26.447 --> 39:28.574
<i>This light and bright cotton tank.</i>

39:28.657 --> 39:31.285
<i>I love the cute little
buttons in the front.</i>

39:31.369 --> 39:32.828
<i>It's such beautiful detailing.</i>

39:32.912 --> 39:36.624
<i>Right? And you'll notice that the strap
perfectly hides her bra.</i>

39:36.707 --> 39:40.086
<i>But why don't designers
think of details like that?</i>

39:40.169 --> 39:41.837
<i>Well, we did. And it comes in...</i>

39:41.921 --> 39:43.172
Just turn it off.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.401
- Thought you liked this show.
<i>- My favorite.</i>

39:46.425 --> 39:48.987
<i>You can just throw it on
with skinnies and a pair of heels</i>

39:49.011 --> 39:50.651
<i>and take yourself out for a fancy dinner.</i>

40:49.447 --> 40:53.701
Thank you for supporting
the Zoey Lyonne Arts Scholarship.

40:55.119 --> 40:59.874
Zoey loved music, and she is
smiling down on us from above.

40:59.957 --> 41:03.335
So please go enjoy some
champagne and...

41:04.378 --> 41:05.838
keep writing those checks.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.216
Thank you.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.853
I'm surprised.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.063
And delighted?

41:23.147 --> 41:24.190
Curious.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.524
I'll take it.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.943
I thought we'd
run into each other eventually.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.863
It only took 25 years.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.450
Also, it's not a coincidence.
I, um, I give every year.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.328
That I would have noticed.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.288
What? You never wondered
who "Anonymous" was?

41:39.872 --> 41:43.584
Yeah, I've been just working up the nerve
to actually attend.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.378
Then I am...

41:47.463 --> 41:48.589
delighted.

41:49.965 --> 41:53.802
Ah. There you are.
Beautifully played, my love.

41:54.470 --> 41:57.681
This is my husband, Peter.
Peter, this is Jeryn Hogarth.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.392
Oh. Wow. The Jeryn Hogarth?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.019
Apparently.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.396
Kith was quite in love with you.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.273
And I with her.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.567
Well, except you broke my heart.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.320
And lucky for me.

42:11.403 --> 42:16.784
I've... I've also followed your, uh...
defending these vigilante super people.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.702
Oh, only a couple of them.

42:18.786 --> 42:22.039
Still, it's a whole new branch of the law.
It's absolutely fascinating.

42:22.122 --> 42:25.709
Former lawyer, obviously.
Now a professor of criminal law.

42:27.127 --> 42:30.631
Well, it was nice to finally meet you,
the Jeryn Hogarth.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.968
But I must pull this beauty away.
We have money for which to grub.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.180
It's nice to see you.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.307
And brief.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.184
You can stick around.

42:42.268 --> 42:46.397
Or I could take you for lunch
and... we could catch up.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.900
It would take much longer than lunch.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.111
I'll clear my schedule.

42:54.822 --> 42:55.948
Call me.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.831
- Kith.
- Look who's here.

43:04.456 --> 43:08.085
- Hi. So good to see you.
- So good to see you, too.

43:08.627 --> 43:09.461
Hand up.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.265
<i>Cody Willamet,
star pitcher for the New York Scouts,</i>

43:12.298 --> 43:14.258
<i>was the victim of a hit-and-run earlier.</i>

43:14.341 --> 43:16.385
- One, two...
<i>- The other driver fled...</i>

43:16.468 --> 43:18.268
- ...three!
<i>- ...leaving police with no leads.</i>

43:18.304 --> 43:20.264
<i>Willamet, a left-hander
and five-time All-Star,</i>

43:20.347 --> 43:24.768
<i>will be out for the season after suffering
what might be a career-ending injury.</i>

43:25.227 --> 43:27.187
Bet you a ten-spot
the guy in the blue shirt

43:27.271 --> 43:29.315
breaks the glass into his hand first.

43:29.857 --> 43:30.858
You can do this.

43:30.941 --> 43:32.661
Twenty says
it's the guy in black and white.

43:32.735 --> 43:36.947
- Let's see what you got, man.
- Yup. Three, two, one. Go.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.283
Oh! Whoa, man!

43:39.366 --> 43:40.659
Man, go get a rag.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.578
- Hey, guys, come over here.
- That looks bad.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.748
- Dude, have a seat. Sit down. Sit.
- Maybe we should go to the ER.

43:45.831 --> 43:48.208
Wrap it up.
All right, man, elevate it.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.645
- I think I slit my wrist.
- That's too high.

43:50.669 --> 43:52.963
I have an instinct for idiocy.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.506
Is that good or bad?

43:54.590 --> 43:56.258
Don't know. Don't care.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.720
Hm. Some people might say
that you lack a moral compass.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.891
I have never, not even once,
given a shit about people like that.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.392
Wish I could say the same.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.561
You do give a shit?

44:07.645 --> 44:08.896
According to my mother.

44:09.605 --> 44:10.606
She'd know.

44:18.030 --> 44:19.239
That sucks.

44:20.282 --> 44:21.575
Whatever happened.

44:22.201 --> 44:23.702
Who says something happened?

44:23.786 --> 44:26.705
Something always happens.
Everything is terrible.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.875
Optimism is a lie. Expect the worst.

44:30.626 --> 44:33.462
Jesus, thanks for the pep talk.

44:33.545 --> 44:37.299
It's reality.
I accept it and proceed accordingly.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.135
To low expectations.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.144
What the hell are you doing?

44:49.728 --> 44:50.728
Dinner.

44:51.230 --> 44:55.609
Yeah, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're making me sick.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.736
Well, puke somewhere else
so I can eat my burger.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.321
That is not a burger.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.784
It's meat in a bun. Burger.

45:03.867 --> 45:08.414
Jesus. Lady, a burger is... is home.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.791
It's summer. It's everything that's good.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.876
I thought good and bad were bullshit.

45:13.335 --> 45:15.504
Mmm. That only applies to people.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.964
What are you, a chef?

45:17.047 --> 45:19.341
I'm more of a motivational speaker.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.928
Read, "Con artist."

45:23.470 --> 45:27.349
No. So you don't have to break my face
or anything.

45:29.643 --> 45:33.814
What? I know who you are.
It's... not exactly a secret.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.942
Yeah, I don't need another critic.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.277
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.946
I'll go, and you stay and...

45:42.072 --> 45:43.240
enjoy your turd.

45:45.909 --> 45:46.952
Thanks for the imagery.

45:47.578 --> 45:54.376
Okay, so imagine a two-to-one-to-one ratio
of chuck, brisket, and short rib

45:54.460 --> 45:55.711
with a coarse mince.

45:55.794 --> 45:56.874
I thought you were leaving.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.756
You gotta cook it in its own fat.

45:58.839 --> 46:02.468
It's like baked potato or sashimi.
It should taste like itself.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.053
If you're heading
toward a pick-up line, don't.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.973
What line? How women should taste?

46:08.056 --> 46:09.224
You were going there.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.894
Still might. But we gotta discuss the bun.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.353
Brioche, lightly toasted,

46:13.437 --> 46:15.355
- brushed with butter.
- I really don't care.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.233
Yeah, but you'd care
if you tasted one of my burgers.

46:18.817 --> 46:19.817
Doubt it.

46:20.235 --> 46:21.695
Fifty bucks says you'll care.

46:23.405 --> 46:26.617
You know who I am.
So you know I can break your face.

46:26.700 --> 46:30.078
I'm just trying to right a wrong.

46:30.704 --> 46:34.666
Right woman. Wrong burger.
That hurts my head.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.169
And that's worth fifty bucks to you?

46:37.836 --> 46:38.837
I won't lose.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.392
So this is where the magic happens.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.395
There's nothing magic about it.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.689
Shame. Kitchen's in here?

46:59.566 --> 47:03.111
You know, I kind of thought that burgers
were code for something else.

47:04.071 --> 47:05.948
My burgers are an aphrodisiac.

47:06.532 --> 47:10.244
Sure, 'cause everybody wants to have sex
with a pound of greasy beef in their gut.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.082
Could do the sex first.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.752
On that very orange couch?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.254
I don't wanna get it dirty.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.548
Well, then...

47:40.899 --> 47:42.776
- I'm Erik, by the way.
- Good to know.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.704
- You're not gonna injure me, are you?
- Mmm, I don't know.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.038
I'll roll the dice.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.630
Mmm.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.011
Might be the upstairs kid.

48:10.429 --> 48:12.764
His dad and ex-wife get arguing.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.350
Maybe he'll go away.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.271
Mmm.

48:25.527 --> 48:28.238
Must be a bad one.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.948
Well, maybe he wants a burger.

48:31.199 --> 48:32.326
I'll get 'em started.

48:35.537 --> 48:37.831
Vido, why are you up so late?

49:14.826 --> 49:18.997
<i>Sometimes...
there is no question...</i>

49:22.084 --> 49:23.502
<i>there's no doubt.</i>

49:28.090 --> 49:29.800
<i>You know what you're looking at.</i>

49:37.766 --> 49:41.228
<i>You know exactly what to do.</i>

49:44.856 --> 49:46.984
<i>Get the bad guy.</i>

50:50.881 --> 50:51.881
<i>I got it.</i>
