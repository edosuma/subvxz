Now you see, let me tell a
story that I was telling you a lot about.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.650
Chasing it, this chick was fucking her felly
and proper giving her some welly as well.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.853
Next thing you know, the fellow's hurt her.
So obviously they stopped beating, init?

00:22.855 --> 00:25.589
She's turned and said to him:
"Instead of you fucking me,

00:25.591 --> 00:28.592
- Why can't you just eat me out? 'cause I'm still a bit sore?"
- That's the way.

00:28.594 --> 00:31.627
Trust me. So he was like, "Ah cool,
but to spice things up a little bit,

00:31.629 --> 00:34.832
- come let's put four Fruittellas up there, init?
- What, man?

00:34.834 --> 00:36.400
She's put four Fruittellas
up her...

00:36.402 --> 00:37.800
I was hoping
you'd fix your jeans.

00:37.802 --> 00:39.471
- Whatever.
- Oh, fuck it.

00:41.307 --> 00:45.808
She put four Fruittellas up there now and my
man would be munching her up munching her up

00:45.810 --> 00:50.446

- Yes, I am. I am.

00:50.448 --> 00:52.415
He went, "The fifth one were
proper nice, init?"

00:52.417 --> 00:54.384
She's like: "Why are you talking
about a fifth one?

00:54.386 --> 00:56.352
I only put four
Fruittellas up there."

00:56.354 --> 00:59.656
Don't think that he was only
gonna fuckin' ate her shit.

00:59.658 --> 01:01.757
How could he eat her
then? That man fucked her.

01:01.759 --> 01:03.327
Listen! Listen!

01:03.329 --> 01:05.662
That man fucked her

barrier and her shit barrier.

01:09.168 --> 01:12.436
- So when he's eating her up, a lump of shit's come out.
- No, no, no.

01:12.438 --> 01:14.171
And that's what man's munched.

01:16.441 --> 01:18.442

01:27.719 --> 01:29.686
She's got a hole

She's got holes and that there.

You got me, init?

01:34.626 --> 01:36.526
- You're nasty.
- Say nothing, init.

01:36.528 --> 01:38.261
Nothing, no one was
talking to you, man.

01:38.263 --> 01:40.163
- Shut up.
- What just happened?

01:40.165 --> 01:42.732

01:42.734 --> 01:44.635

01:44.637 --> 01:46.335

01:53.478 --> 01:55.248
Come man. Come check.

02:09.426 --> 02:13.329
Oh, Boogie, this is our car.

02:13.331 --> 02:15.264

02:24.977 --> 02:26.709
What d'you mean it's bait?
Bruv, aye, bruv.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.245

I'm going.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.784
Whoa, whoa. What d'you mean?

02:33.786 --> 02:36.620
Hey, what do you mean?

Yeah, you do it. Yeah,

02:39.758 --> 02:42.425
Says the one that fucked the
beef. Why don't you do it, bruv?

02:42.427 --> 02:45.629
- You're the only one that's dumb enough to do it anyways then.
- How?

02:45.631 --> 02:47.400
I don't know, umm...
Ch-ta-ta-ta.

03:15.927 --> 03:17.963
- Right.
- He's come underneath with the left.

03:35.614 --> 03:37.680
Still while they're boxing,
you know what I mean?

03:37.682 --> 03:39.352
They're more open,
they're down here.

03:57.836 --> 03:59.636
- Okay. Then you go and clinch.
- Okay.

03:59.638 --> 04:01.807
Like that.

05:16.115 --> 05:22.487
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

05:24.055 --> 05:28.591
Fuck. Mom. Mom. Mom, look at me.

No, no, no, no. Look at me.

Mom. Mom, look at me.
Look at me. Mom. Mom. Mom.

05:50.182 --> 05:54.120
It's Leon, mom. Come on.

05:58.824 --> 06:02.591
Mom, you're going to have to drink.
You're going to have to drink, mom. Mom.

06:02.593 --> 06:06.699
Look. Look, look.
It's alright. It's alright.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.980
Have you ever
thought about getting help?

06:56.982 --> 07:00.851
- About what exactly?
- Your drinking.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.456
It's nice to know you're concerned, but
I've stopped drinking, so we're all good.

07:05.189 --> 07:08.692
- Chelsea, I know you don't want me here.
- You got that right.

07:08.694 --> 07:12.628
But Leon came into our care
voluntarily when he was 15

07:12.630 --> 07:15.632
and even though he's come home to you
now we just want to support him.

07:15.634 --> 07:17.601
So, please, let us do that.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.269
What the fuck do
you think I'm doing?

07:19.271 --> 07:22.005
- I'm his fucking mother, Rachael.
- I'm trying to help here.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.774
- Help? You're just interfering.
- This doesn't have to be your fight.

07:24.776 --> 07:27.577
It's 'cause you're always fucking
interfering all the freaking time.

07:27.579 --> 07:29.211
It's just for your son's
best interest.

07:29.213 --> 07:31.483
Oh, have you? And what,
I haven't? Oh my...

07:36.254 --> 07:37.689
Then go on and say something.

07:38.757 --> 07:41.591
Yes. I'm just checking in.

07:41.593 --> 07:45.027
Getting a quick update to see if you
want to go back into education.

07:45.029 --> 07:48.632
Ah... Sorry, but I think that boat's
already sailed, don't you, Rachael?

07:48.634 --> 07:49.802
Not at all. He's only 19.

07:53.605 --> 07:56.108
- Have you thought about going back to college?
- No.

07:58.242 --> 07:59.612
How are you filling your days?

08:00.846 --> 08:03.249
- Going to the gym.
- He's there all the time.

08:04.583 --> 08:05.651
The gym is great, actually.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.183
Yes, he goes there for fighting.

08:08.185 --> 08:09.420
- It's boxing.
- I know, what I just said.

08:12.089 --> 08:14.690
Perhaps, we could look
into a course related to that.

08:14.692 --> 08:17.961
And what about money? And surely
we should be talking about work here?

08:17.963 --> 08:20.262
He's got no
qualifications.

08:20.264 --> 08:24.166
He's got no work experience. He's going
to find it really hard to get work.

08:24.168 --> 08:26.303
I can put a roof over
his head, but I'm not in

08:26.305 --> 08:28.908
a position to help him out
more than that right now.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.912
If you stop drinking,
you might be able to.

08:37.615 --> 08:39.217
Yeah, we're done here.

08:40.251 --> 08:41.785
Shut the door on your way out.

08:50.195 --> 08:51.097
Leon...

08:56.033 --> 08:57.035
This is my number.

08:59.971 --> 09:02.207
Call me if you're interested and
we'll see what we can do, OK?

09:22.126 --> 09:26.665
Relax. That's alright.
For the head.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.967
Focus, Leon.

09:30.969 --> 09:32.835
Footwork. Where's your footwork?

09:32.837 --> 09:35.037
And again. Jump to the head.

09:35.039 --> 09:36.272
Footwork, Leon.

09:36.274 --> 09:37.940
Push him back.
That's it.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.010
Protect yourself.

09:44.916 --> 09:48.852
What's going on? Get in
there, and stop fucking smoking.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.725
- I'm not fucking smoking.
- I can smell it on you. Come on get on with it.

09:55.427 --> 09:56.662
Alright, that's it.

10:53.751 --> 10:58.421
No, no, no. No, don't fuck...
You're fucking up the rotation, bruv.

10:58.423 --> 11:00.359
- Alright, chill. Shit.
- Oh, no.

11:01.493 --> 11:04.026
He's got every time.

11:04.028 --> 11:06.296
Tell me if they've
put in something there.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.867
Alright, alright.

11:10.869 --> 11:12.435
You guys are taking
your time, you know.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.241
My man finished
this thing you know.

11:20.044 --> 11:22.478
I wish my balloon
was anything like that, bruv.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.347
Are you sure it don't fuck up
your lungs, 'cause

11:24.349 --> 11:26.382
I don't want nothing to happen
to my lungs, init?

11:26.384 --> 11:29.285
Oh my God. Stop being
a pussy, bro.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.286
Fuck the pussy,
not be the pussy.

11:31.288 --> 11:33.223
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do
it. Shall I do it now?

11:33.225 --> 11:36.025
- Do it, man.
- Shut the fuck up and do it, man.

11:36.027 --> 11:38.197
You suck,
like you suck dick.

11:39.831 --> 11:45.771
Wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.
Whoa. Whoa.

11:47.404 --> 11:49.238
Take it like a champ.
Hey, sit down.

11:50.475 --> 11:51.974
Oh, my God.

11:51.976 --> 11:54.777
Eh. Eh, wow. Whoa.

11:54.779 --> 11:57.180
Oh. Oh, wow. Whoa.

11:57.182 --> 11:59.784
My mind. Oh, wait. Oh!

12:01.219 --> 12:03.520
Hey, I've got
somewhere to be, you know.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.888
- Where?
- Local place, down the corner, like 20 minutes.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.157
- Let's go.
- Will you just wait, bruv. Wait!

12:08.159 --> 12:11.194
20 minutes down the road.

12:11.196 --> 12:13.363
You're forgetting
the drinks, man. Grab the drink.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.964
Are you guys seriously
going? Seriously?

12:14.966 --> 12:16.565
I'm kinda hungry man,
it's kinda...

12:16.567 --> 12:19.868
- Grab them chicken and chips.
- Shut the fuck up.

12:46.998 --> 12:47.900
I say nothing.

13:11.956 --> 13:14.390
If you was to turn around and say
to him, "I take it up the arse"...

13:15.927 --> 13:17.526
Not everyone is like you,
you know.

13:17.528 --> 13:20.128
I know, but you know
what the realness thing is?

13:20.130 --> 13:22.632
He'll be waiting on you
hand and foot, girl.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.367
You will get anything
you want after that.

13:24.369 --> 13:25.538
You won't worry about nothing.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.374
Hey, let's bounce.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.373
Tell them, fam.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.944
Look at them.

13:39.384 --> 13:40.949
I'm calling him now.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.888
No, man. Give my phone back.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.990
Hey.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.601
Hi.

13:59.070 --> 13:59.972
Oh, right. Sorry.

14:08.279 --> 14:09.214
Holy shit.

14:15.653 --> 14:18.090
- What's happening, sugar?
- It's Twiggy.

14:21.326 --> 14:25.494
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been looking
around this place and I'm pretty sure

14:25.496 --> 14:27.866
you're the most
beautiful girl at this party.

14:28.566 --> 14:30.369
Second most beautiful.

14:46.116 --> 14:47.919
So, you guys are pretty close?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.294
What are you doing?

16:42.767 --> 16:45.004
How did you find out
about this place?

16:46.303 --> 16:47.438
I live here.

16:48.773 --> 16:52.742
You live here?
Where is your bedroom?

16:52.744 --> 16:53.711
Upstairs.

16:57.782 --> 17:00.719
What's so funny? What?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.022
I don't know.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.590
Don't you like my place?

17:08.593 --> 17:09.728
I didn't say that.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.662
What's the rent like
on this place?

17:13.664 --> 17:15.098
We don't pay rent.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.300
How is it legal?

17:18.303 --> 17:21.106
It's not. We squat.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.342
You're a squatter?

17:25.175 --> 17:26.676
You don't really
look like a squatter.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.084
But what do I look like?

17:33.351 --> 17:34.816
Hey, where
the fuck is my phone?

17:34.818 --> 17:35.750
Where is what?

17:35.752 --> 17:36.686
My phone.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.323
I don't know.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.596
- One of you guys taken my phone?
- What the fuck are you doing?

17:47.598 --> 17:50.533
Where did you put my fucking
phone? He took my phone!

17:50.535 --> 17:51.867
Leave him alone.

17:51.869 --> 17:53.469
- I don't have your phone.
- Fuck off.

17:53.471 --> 17:54.772
Get up and let me
check your pockets.

17:55.673 --> 17:58.509
Oi, get off! Get your hands
off my fuckin' pockets.

17:59.576 --> 18:01.477
Come on then, hit me,
you fucking prick.

18:01.479 --> 18:02.815
Come on then. Come on then.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.900
- You alright, Carter?
- It just got crazy.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.238
Fucking hell. Is he alright?

18:27.238 --> 18:29.271
What the fuck was that

18:29.273 --> 18:30.672
Try go for my man, init?

18:30.674 --> 18:31.576
Why?

18:33.545 --> 18:35.545
What? They said someone
stole a phone in there.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.313
It's always you, init?

18:37.315 --> 18:40.882
Oh, shit.
Hey, look what I found.

18:40.884 --> 18:42.418
Oh, my days.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.952
What the fuck, bro?

18:43.954 --> 18:47.456
Get off him, bruv.
Get off him.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.628
Fuck off. What are you doing?

18:53.263 --> 18:56.498
- I'll see you later. Pussy.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.670
Hey, Leon. Dickhead, man.

19:17.955 --> 19:22.725
<i>An investigation is underway after
police shot dead a man in North London.</i>

19:22.727 --> 19:25.527
<i>The 24-year-old was
in his home at the time</i>

19:25.529 --> 19:27.496
<i>and was about to be arrested
when for reasons</i>

19:27.498 --> 19:30.369
<i>that haven't been confirmed yet
when marksmen opened fire.</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:33.236
<i>Paramedics tried
to resuscitate him,</i>

19:33.238 --> 19:34.673
<i>but he died at the scene.</i>

19:38.509 --> 19:40.242
<i>The man is said to
be a father of three</i>

19:40.244 --> 19:42.378
<i>and was well known
in the community.</i>

19:42.380 --> 19:44.713
<i>The area's MP is
tonight calling for calm</i>

19:44.715 --> 19:47.882
<i>as the police watchdog
investigates what happened.</i>

20:03.468 --> 20:04.369
Yeah?

20:05.403 --> 20:06.471
Do you not remember me?

20:09.307 --> 20:15.010
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
What are you doing here?

20:15.012 --> 20:16.747
We spoke at the party.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.651
Oh, fuck. You need to go.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.853
Carter's going to kick off
if he knows you're back.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.923
No. No, it's alright.
I came to talk with him, though.

20:26.958 --> 20:28.427
Really not the right time.

20:30.761 --> 20:35.064
I wanted to give him this so, I
don't know if you can pass it on.

20:35.066 --> 20:38.534
- Oh, so I'll just take it.
- Sweet.

20:38.536 --> 20:42.537
Nice of you to return it. I'll
give it to him. Thanks. Cheers.

20:42.539 --> 20:45.543
Whoa. Can I get your number?

20:46.943 --> 20:47.812
What?

20:48.712 --> 20:49.714
I'd like your number.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.418
What are you talking about?

20:54.585 --> 20:55.884
Can I see you again?

20:55.886 --> 20:56.821
Why?

20:57.989 --> 21:01.356
I don't know. I was thinking...
Hang out or something.

21:01.358 --> 21:04.962
If you give me your number,
I'll go. So, to be saving time.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.701
See. It's here.

21:24.848 --> 21:29.451
Whoa, I don't know
if this is your number.

21:29.453 --> 21:32.456
I'll call it. Then
we'll know if it's your number.

21:37.428 --> 21:38.764
I don't hear anything ringing.

21:42.099 --> 21:48.973
That's rude, you know.
We'll go again, OK, OK? OK.

22:00.451 --> 22:02.520
- Happy?
- Yes. Happy.

22:03.988 --> 22:09.557
Now promise me you're
gonna leave. Promise.

22:09.559 --> 22:10.461
I promise.

22:15.566 --> 22:16.699
It's nice to see you again.

22:16.701 --> 22:17.602
Hum.

23:12.123 --> 23:14.092
Let me give you
a drink. Come on.

23:15.926 --> 23:16.827
Yeah?

23:19.830 --> 23:23.601
Leon, come and dance with mommy.

23:26.002 --> 23:28.237
Lee, come and dance with mommy.

23:28.239 --> 23:30.538
- Leon, come on.
- I don't want to, mom.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.543
Leon, come on and dance with me.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.914
Don't be such a grumpy fucker.
Come and dance with your mommy.

23:38.015 --> 23:39.648
Alright. Come, son.
Come here, Chris.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.150
Come and say hello to Chris.
Chris!

23:41.152 --> 23:43.518
Come and meet Chris!

23:43.520 --> 23:47.523
Chris, oi. Chris,
this is my son, Leon.

23:47.525 --> 23:50.726
- You want some?
- No, no. He doesn't. He doesn't do that.

23:50.728 --> 23:51.759
- You sure?
- No.

23:51.761 --> 23:52.862
He's old enough.

23:52.864 --> 23:53.996
No, he is not old enough.

24:15.653 --> 24:19.124
Babe, we're all out. Lee, are
you going down the shop, baby?

24:21.125 --> 24:25.628
Oh, be a darling and get
Mummy a bottle of vodka.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.196
I've just put my dinner on,
Mum.

24:27.198 --> 24:30.231
Mate, she said
she needs a drink.

24:32.836 --> 24:35.571
No, you're right.
You've had enough.

24:35.573 --> 24:37.072
I've had enough.

24:37.074 --> 24:39.177
You need to start
looking after yourself.

24:44.682 --> 24:45.948
Keep an eye on my pizza, mom.

24:45.950 --> 24:47.283
Keep an eye on my fucking pizza.

24:47.285 --> 24:51.756
Lee. Hey, be quick, yeah?
Be quick.

I don't lose, bruv!

25:55.853 --> 25:58.286
What do you mean, you don't
lose? You just lost!

25:58.288 --> 26:01.957
- How did he lose? He blatantly just won!
- He just lost!

26:01.959 --> 26:03.292
- How?
- It just hit the fucking wall!

26:03.294 --> 26:05.294
- So?
- Hey, put the money down.

26:05.296 --> 26:08.229
- Bruv, that's how you play.
- Put the fucking money down.

26:08.231 --> 26:11.366
Yeah, you know what, darling? You're
just jealous because no one will want

26:11.368 --> 26:13.869

wrinkly minge.

26:13.871 --> 26:15.203
I'd rather be an old bitch than a
trollop who can't keep her legs shut

26:15.205 --> 26:18.007
Aw, what's that?
You're just jealous.

26:18.009 --> 26:20.776
Go on. Fuck off.
Go and look after your son.

26:20.778 --> 26:27.682
- You're incapable, an embarrassment.
- Fuck off, you trollop.

Oh.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.418
Where are we going?

27:36.420 --> 27:37.855
To my friend's place.

27:39.323 --> 27:40.291
Why are we going there?

27:42.759 --> 27:43.862
They're being evicted.

27:45.061 --> 27:45.963
So?

27:48.132 --> 27:50.101
Don't you care about
what happens to other people?

27:53.037 --> 27:54.405
Ah, it's just life, init?

27:57.273 --> 28:01.343
Is that right?
Is this our house?

28:01.345 --> 28:03.112
- Is this it?
- Yes.

28:04.781 --> 28:06.914
And you should
respect other people.

28:06.916 --> 28:08.019
I am standing back.

28:09.452 --> 28:13.388
- I'm on the side.
- You are so clever, aren't you. And so very funny.

28:13.390 --> 28:15.356
Ladies and gentlemen, apparently
I am ridiculously clever.

28:15.358 --> 28:16.727
I am ridiculously clever.

28:17.428 --> 28:18.329
Who's that guy?

28:19.829 --> 28:20.831
Oh, it's my boyfriend.

28:23.901 --> 28:25.534
So she said she can't
get back now...

28:25.536 --> 28:28.402
This riff-raff who are hiding
their faces...

28:28.404 --> 28:30.774
Pointing is very rude.

28:31.875 --> 28:34.409
People can't get away.
I have to deny that one.

28:34.411 --> 28:37.078
Squeeze them out of here.
You two don't need to be here.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.315
We're just having a discussion. We won't
be friendly if you two standing...

28:41.417 --> 28:42.785
I have no idea what...

28:42.787 --> 28:44.253
whatever it is you are doing.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.020
Guys, what is it we're doing?

28:47.324 --> 28:48.856
Guys, calm down.

28:48.858 --> 28:50.294
Oh, we're good, we're good.

28:51.261 --> 28:53.394
Hey, Leon. This is shit.

28:53.396 --> 28:55.200
Go on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.274
So is this a new
recruit, Twiggy?

29:18.021 --> 29:19.888
Jazzy houses round here.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.392
Nearly as big as your house,
Twiggy.

29:25.095 --> 29:27.065
- Nearly.
- Yeah, nearly.

29:46.282 --> 29:47.451
Whoa, whoa. Whose is this?

29:49.153 --> 29:50.989
It's mine.

29:52.388 --> 29:53.824
What's so funny?

29:55.259 --> 29:57.625
Nothing. I just always wondered who
actually lived on these things.

30:03.032 --> 30:04.935
Do you want to grab
the other one? Just untie it.

31:48.172 --> 31:50.439
Have you ever been
on one of these before?

31:50.441 --> 31:51.542
- No.
- No?

31:53.676 --> 31:54.645
It's so quiet, bro.

31:55.779 --> 31:57.981
I could live out here
for like a week or something.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.085
Maybe even longer, you know.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.420
You can think clear,
you know what I'm saying?

32:05.422 --> 32:09.360
No noise, no cars, no nothing.
No people shouting and shit.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.597
- I might get one of these.
- Yeah?

32:16.599 --> 32:21.303
Yes, when I'm older
I might buy one. Red and black.

32:21.305 --> 32:22.507
What would you call your boat?

32:23.607 --> 32:26.607
I don't know, mate.
Leon's boat. That's shit, init?

32:26.609 --> 32:31.278
Leon's boat?
Leon's boat. Oh, Leon's.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.017
Obviously I'd get a good deal
or something.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.501
Here you go. You take it.

33:06.083 --> 33:10.721
Oh, man. We should do this
again, you know. Yeah, man.

33:14.424 --> 33:16.290
Who are
the murderers?

33:16.292 --> 33:17.691
Police are
the murderers.

33:17.693 --> 33:19.294
Who are
the murderers?

33:19.296 --> 33:21.430
Police are

33:31.842 --> 33:34.276
<i>that the non-police

<i>was actually recovered from
the drawer in the man's home</i>

33:37.280 --> 33:41.083
<i>and therefore wasn't in his hands
at the time of the shooting.</i>

33:41.085 --> 33:44.352
<i>The word on the street is
that this was an execution</i>

33:44.354 --> 33:46.289
<i>and the community are not happy.</i>

33:48.090 --> 33:52.227
<i>Well, the situation now
is that there is an intense standoff.</i>

officers are holding back</i>

<i>Community leaders from the area have repeatedly
warned the police that trouble is likely</i>

<i>and they're urging them to go out
into the community and provide reassurance.</i>

34:11.748 --> 34:15.349
<i>But the police has stated
that their hands are tied</i>

- Yes.

What, you want to be
my friend now?

36:03.626 --> 36:05.529
- Lord, yes.
- Why?

36:08.264 --> 36:09.933
Just trying to make amends,
that's all.

36:12.936 --> 36:15.537

been there for you but...

36:15.539 --> 36:16.774
I'm trying now, ain't I?

36:21.577 --> 36:22.746
What's with this Chris guy?

36:23.880 --> 36:25.713
Chris? What about him?

36:25.715 --> 36:26.516
What's he doing here?

36:27.784 --> 36:29.686
Don't worry about him,
he's harmless.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.459
Well, he's better
than your fucking dad.

Oh, come on.

Let's not go
down this road again.

I'll have a word, I promise.

36:47.737 --> 36:50.240
Let's just
forget about it, okay?

36:52.675 --> 36:58.382
Listen, umm... why don't
you, umm... treat yourself?

36:59.949 --> 37:02.284

something. No, just take it.

Yes?

38:50.527 --> 38:51.595

38:52.762 --> 38:55.396
- Sorry?
- I'm looking for work, or work experience.

38:55.398 --> 38:57.902
Sorry, man, I'm a bit
up against it at the moment.

39:25.094 --> 39:28.996

41:14.938 --> 41:18.005

41:18.007 --> 41:22.577
<i>For the second night running we've
got copycat acts of violence.</i>

41:22.579 --> 41:26.717

they are calling pure criminality.</i>

<i>Justice will be done and</i>

41:30.119 --> 41:32.922

41:49.204 --> 41:50.204
Hey!

41:50.206 --> 41:53.177
Hurry up.

41:57.112 --> 42:00.648
Man, we cool, yeah? We cool?

42:19.802 --> 42:21.269
This
shit's going to kill you.

42:21.271 --> 42:23.137
One day it will
fucking kill you, hey.

42:23.139 --> 42:25.305
It will fucking kill you.
Fuck, fuck.

42:30.847 --> 42:32.646
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.852
What are
you gonna do, yo?

43:43.920 --> 43:45.755
We need to get what?
But what?

43:47.891 --> 43:49.259
Back to the bus, boys.

43:52.394 --> 43:54.362
What's up?
It's not a funny thing, yeah?

44:06.342 --> 44:08.409
You're not gonna
be laughing in a minute.

44:08.411 --> 44:09.880
- My cock.
- What did he say?

44:10.780 --> 44:11.682
My cock.

44:12.849 --> 44:14.081
Yeah. Alright, boys.

44:18.755 --> 44:20.121
Fuck you, bro.

44:28.264 --> 44:30.465
I say, man up, my gangsters.
Excuse me.

44:30.467 --> 44:31.402
My country.

44:32.735 --> 44:34.170
Man up my Gs, man up my Gs.

44:38.373 --> 44:40.307
You know what's the strategy?

44:40.309 --> 44:41.911
You know everybody's strategy?

44:45.849 --> 44:49.952
You got a plan? You got a plan?
These dickheads.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.356
Come, man.
Let's go up there, man.

44:59.461 --> 45:00.797
I live down there, man.

45:05.101 --> 45:06.704
GCSEs.

45:07.402 --> 45:08.869
What do you mean, GCSEs, bruv?

45:08.871 --> 45:10.339
GCSEs.

45:13.376 --> 45:15.809
- I just wanna go to my house.
- You don't live down there.

45:15.811 --> 45:18.114
I do live down there. How do you
know that I don't live down here?

46:14.103 --> 46:16.405
Get back, get back.

46:31.454 --> 46:32.990
Oh, shit.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.065
Hey, this is nuts, fam.

46:45.235 --> 46:46.135
Woah!

46:48.036 --> 46:49.403
Hey, those guys were
shook, though.

46:49.405 --> 46:51.037
I can't, let's go back, man.

46:51.039 --> 46:53.206
- Alright, come.
- No, he's not from there.

46:53.208 --> 46:56.610
- No, let's go now.
- Let me catch my breath first, man.

46:56.612 --> 46:58.414
- Hey.
- What?

47:01.583 --> 47:03.885
Hey, man, I was wondering where
you lot disappeared to, man.

47:03.887 --> 47:05.522
- Why are you lying?
- What?

47:06.389 --> 47:08.155
Oh, I come here, you know me.

47:08.157 --> 47:10.224
I had to do a little stop
here, man. You know me.

47:10.226 --> 47:11.925
What you got for me, fam?

47:11.927 --> 47:14.228
Let's see what you got there,
bro. Let me see.

47:14.230 --> 47:16.264
Hey, you look like
a fucking waste man.

47:16.266 --> 47:18.065
What's wrong with you, man?
Chill out, man.

47:18.067 --> 47:19.499
This ain't about
stealing stuff, bro.

47:19.501 --> 47:20.903
This is about revenge, man.

47:22.572 --> 47:24.338
No, it's definitely
about stealing stuff.

47:26.242 --> 47:27.909
Alright, whatever.
I'm getting out.

47:27.911 --> 47:29.443
I'll check you out later.
You know me.

47:29.445 --> 47:31.112
Stand your
fucking ground, man.

47:31.114 --> 47:32.316
Oh my days, man.

47:35.251 --> 47:37.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:39.554 --> 47:42.289
What's that?
What are you thinking?

47:42.291 --> 47:44.090
Alright.
Don't be dumb, bruv.

47:44.092 --> 47:47.494
Don't be dumb?
Don't be dumb.

47:47.496 --> 47:50.697
Let's go there now and
let's fuck them up, man. Come.

47:50.699 --> 47:55.168
Hey, man. What are you
planning to do with that?

47:55.170 --> 47:57.470
I'm going there and fucking killing
them and I don't give a fuck.

47:57.472 --> 47:58.940
Yes, go.

47:58.942 --> 48:00.608
Man, let's go.

48:00.610 --> 48:02.610
Hey, listen to me, man. This
are salmon toed sneakers,

48:02.612 --> 48:04.345
Don't man.
I know you want some sneakers.

48:04.347 --> 48:06.179
I don't give a fuck
about no sneakers, man.

48:06.181 --> 48:07.682
Fuck this, man.

48:07.684 --> 48:09.383
And where are you going, man?

48:09.385 --> 48:11.584
I'm not gonna start
no fucking fires, man.

48:11.586 --> 48:13.186
Run away then, you pussy.

48:13.188 --> 48:14.255
Oh shit.

48:14.257 --> 48:16.090
Let's go. Come on.

48:16.092 --> 48:17.090
Let's go.

48:17.092 --> 48:17.994
Let's go.

48:19.128 --> 48:21.030
Hey. No. No. Hey. Hey.

48:22.231 --> 48:24.432
Hey, Leon, what
are you doing, man?

48:24.434 --> 48:25.569
What's he gonna do?

48:27.503 --> 48:29.570
I don't know, but I feel
we should stick together, man.

48:29.572 --> 48:32.072
No, man. This is bullshit, man.

48:32.074 --> 48:35.011
Go on. Go run along to your
little blonde girlfriend, yeah?

48:37.213 --> 48:39.512
Come on, fam. Come on.

48:39.514 --> 48:42.115
Hey, Leon. Hey, Leon.
Come with us, man.

48:42.117 --> 48:43.019
No.

48:49.125 --> 48:50.523
Hey, where are you going?

48:50.525 --> 48:54.130
Leon, remember
your roots, man.

49:10.146 --> 49:11.648
Police, Police. Stop!

49:24.760 --> 49:26.327
You alright?

49:26.329 --> 49:28.095
You all right, mate.

49:28.097 --> 49:29.329
What's going on?

49:29.331 --> 49:31.067
Car's fucking broke.

49:36.172 --> 49:37.074
Hey.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.110
You alright?

49:42.277 --> 49:43.480
It's not a good day.

49:48.583 --> 49:50.517
What's wrong with it anyway?

49:50.519 --> 49:52.552
No idea. You don't know
anything about cars, do you?

49:52.554 --> 49:54.054
No, man.

49:54.056 --> 49:55.391
- You don't have one.
- No.

49:59.728 --> 50:04.433
I need to get out of this fucking city for
a few hours so I can hear myself think.

50:17.246 --> 50:19.679
- ...more try and figure out.
- Let's go.

50:19.681 --> 50:21.315
- We'll talk about it later...
- We're going now.

50:21.317 --> 50:23.483
...because we're going...

50:23.485 --> 50:26.353
- Later, of course.
- ...it's not like I don't wanna speak about it.

50:26.355 --> 50:28.121
Oh.

50:28.123 --> 50:30.257
- This is nice, is it yours?
- No, man.

50:30.259 --> 50:31.492
- Oh, shit.
- Where are we going?

50:31.494 --> 50:32.793
I know, I'll drive.

50:32.795 --> 50:34.260
You drive.

52:35.650 --> 52:36.619
This is mad, bro.

52:37.519 --> 52:39.253
Yes.

52:40.922 --> 52:43.624
- It's a mad fucking city,
- I know.

52:43.626 --> 52:45.458
That's what my mom says,
it's a mad city.

52:45.460 --> 52:46.395
- Yes?
- Yes.

52:47.630 --> 52:48.698
Got the lighter?

53:01.876 --> 53:06.483
And the siren as well.
Always sirens, 24/7 sirens.

53:08.784 --> 53:10.016
This place is fucked.

53:36.012 --> 53:37.647
- I'll see you later.
- Uh-huh.

54:36.972 --> 54:38.041
It's upstairs, mate.

54:41.376 --> 54:42.512
Lovely drive, ain't she?

54:44.880 --> 54:48.785
Clutch catches a bit but... that's
to be expected with the old models.

54:50.585 --> 54:53.389
The thing about her,
is I love her.

54:56.858 --> 54:58.891
And she's mine.

54:58.893 --> 55:00.796
Takes a little bit
of time to get going but...

55:01.864 --> 55:03.632
once she starts going, I mean...

55:04.632 --> 55:06.900
you'll never ever have
a ride like it in your life.

55:06.902 --> 55:08.735
You fucking...

55:08.737 --> 55:09.905
Come here!

55:13.842 --> 55:16.075
What are we fucking going
to do with you, eh?

55:16.077 --> 55:18.945
That's the fucking problem. I should
pop your eye out, you little cunt,

55:18.947 --> 55:20.046
then you'll fucking learn.

55:20.048 --> 55:21.749
Leave him alone!

55:21.751 --> 55:23.583
Leave him fucking alone!

55:23.585 --> 55:25.688
Stop it.
Chris, fucking stop it.

55:26.989 --> 55:28.490
- You snitch.
- Ouch!

55:40.802 --> 55:41.837
Is that all you got?

55:46.708 --> 55:48.742
Look what you
fucking made me do!

55:48.744 --> 55:49.679
Fuck you!

55:53.416 --> 55:55.715
Lee, stop.
Lee, listen to me!

55:55.717 --> 55:58.584
I'll fucking kill him!
I'll fucking kill him!

55:58.586 --> 56:00.052
You're fucking dead!

56:00.054 --> 56:01.789
Leon, Lee,
please listen to me.

56:01.791 --> 56:04.425
Lee, please listen to me.

56:04.427 --> 56:08.896
You fucking listen. Just leave
it! Lee, he's not worth it.

56:08.898 --> 56:10.664
Lee, please, just get out
of this. Leave it.

56:10.666 --> 56:14.403
Lee, please, just leave it!
Leave it, Lee!

59:37.405 --> 59:38.307
It's okay.

59:45.981 --> 59:48.217
What happened? Look at me.

59:57.992 --> 01:00:02.699
Are you okay? Stay here.

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:25.320
It's okay. It's okay.

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:31.360
Stay still.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:30.110
Alright guys, come on. Everybody out. Time
to leave. Go out. You need to get out.

01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:32.545
- What do you mean? Fuck! We haven't done anything wrong.
- OK, mate.

01:02:32.547 --> 01:02:35.548
You know you're not supposed to be here.
You're in trouble. You need to leave.

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:47.059
Step away. Step away.
Get back. Get back!

01:02:47.061 --> 01:02:49.364
Oi, get back! Fucking
get back right now!

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.939
Oi, get off him!

01:02:58.172 --> 01:02:59.505
Hey! Get back.

01:02:59.507 --> 01:03:00.440
Get off him!

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:01.842
You get back.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:02.608
Get off him.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.543
Come on, get...

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:05.579
Fuck off!

01:03:08.282 --> 01:03:09.316
Leave him!

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.557
Hold him! Hold him!

01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:20.328
- Oh, God!
- Hold him.

01:03:24.498 --> 01:03:26.268
Move it!
Get out of the house!

01:03:35.443 --> 01:03:36.445
Hold it!

01:03:43.284 --> 01:03:44.186
Stay down.

01:03:45.387 --> 01:03:47.653
Look, I don't think they're
chasing us. I don't think...

01:03:47.655 --> 01:03:50.590
Fuckin' hell. Shit, my eyes.

01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:55.061
What the fuck was that stuff?
Some fucking poison.

01:03:55.063 --> 01:03:58.498
- It's mace. It's fucking mace.
- Shit. What do you think happened to the other guys?

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.233
- I don't know.
- They fucking like dragged them out of there.

01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:04.403
- Where are we going? Where are we going?
- Shit. This way. Come on.

01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:05.507
Come on, hurry up.

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:17.516
Yeah? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:04:17.518 --> 01:04:19.653
- Just let us fucking in.
- No, no, fuck that, OK?

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.655
Had to have seven stitches
'cause of this prick.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:24.391
- It wasn't him.
- He stole my phone.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:27.193
- And he returned it.
- I don't give a fuck.

01:04:27.195 --> 01:04:28.097
He can fuck off.

01:04:30.998 --> 01:04:33.969
Fuck you! Fucking cunt! Shit!

01:05:32.527 --> 01:05:34.126
Fuck!

01:05:34.128 --> 01:05:35.130
What's wrong?

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.367
I left my fucking
camera in the squat.

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:44.771
- Whereabouts?
- In the bedroom. Those fucking...

01:05:44.773 --> 01:05:49.278
I'll find it for you. Obviously I'm not gonna go
back there now, but I'll find it for you. OK?

01:05:50.244 --> 01:05:51.146
Don't worry.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.549
- Yeah?
- Sorry.

01:05:58.686 --> 01:05:59.587
I'll find it.

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:05.758
I promise you
everything's gonna be OK.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.996
You don't need to worry.

01:06:09.164 --> 01:06:13.102
Lee? Are you all right?

01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:26.449
- Mom. This is Twiggy.
- Hello.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:34.724
Twiggy.
Where did you spring from?

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:40.329
Don't know.
Same place as you I guess.

01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:47.169
We definitely didn't come from
the same place, darling.

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:54.510
Is it OK if Twiggy stays over?

01:06:56.110 --> 01:07:01.349
Yeah... You stay
as long as you like.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.809
Mum, will you stop?
Stop, Mum. Mum, stop. Stop!

01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:33.682
Mum, Mum... Mum, Mum, stop!

01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:37.452
Stop. Look at me
and stop. Stop.

01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:44.593
Stop Mom.

01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:49.664
I need a drink, Leon.

01:07:53.568 --> 01:07:54.637
I'll sort it out, all right.

01:07:57.338 --> 01:07:58.239
I'll sort it out.

01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:14.887
- Leon!
- Oh, shit.

01:08:14.889 --> 01:08:17.358
- What happened to your face?
- Boxing.

01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:20.692
You need to work on your guard.

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:21.595
Yes.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:24.166
I thought you were
gonna call me.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.701
I was. I will. I've just been mad busy.
I'll call you. I promise.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:31.670
- OK? I promise. I will. I'll call you.
- All right.

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:35.375
<i>Fires are breaking out across
large parts of London tonight as more</i>

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:39.211
<i>serious violence spreads across
the streets of the capital.</i>

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:43.750
<i>The latest trouble started in Lewisham
South-East of the city late afternoon.</i>

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:49.788
<i>Before spreading to Hackney, Clapton and
now in the last hour in South London.</i>

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:52.392
- <i>These are the latest...</i>
- Two bottles of vodka, please.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.426
<i>from Croydon, where
a furniture store</i>

01:08:54.429 --> 01:08:56.795
<i>has been ablaze for
at least an hour now.</i>

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:26.328
So, when can
I speak to him, then?

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:30.330
Well, my dad's a
lawyer so I happen to know

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.700
that I'm entitled
to speak to him.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.205
Yeah. That's
fucking unacceptable.

01:09:38.872 --> 01:09:42.241
Do you know what? Listen, I spoke to
someone earlier and they twist my words.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:44.479
You guys are all the fucking
same, like, I swear to God.

01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:15.711
Thanks, Lee.

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.454
You don't have to
worry about Chris no more.

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:30.659
He won't be coming back.

01:10:35.063 --> 01:10:37.830
- Let's have a look at it then.
- Mom, it's all right.

01:10:37.832 --> 01:10:39.965
- No, please. Can we just...
- Mom...

01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:42.403
Leon, please, let me see.

01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:06.929
Look what he's done to
your beautiful face.

01:11:11.466 --> 01:11:12.501
I'm so sorry, son.

01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:19.375
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.414
Maybe you shouldn't
have come back here.

01:11:42.997 --> 01:11:45.367
- Mom.
- Come here. Just let me do it, OK?

01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:52.507
- I'm sorry, does it hurt?
- It's all right.

01:12:02.649 --> 01:12:03.551
She's good.

01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:09.390
She seems like
a really nice girl.

01:12:11.859 --> 01:12:13.094
She your girlfriend?

01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:15.631
No.

01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:18.634
She should be.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.037
Just make sure
she treats you right, yes?

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:29.077
That's what you need now, son. You need...
you need someone who can look after you.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:34.349
I'm not good for you anymore.

01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:42.524
You deserve better than this.

01:12:52.934 --> 01:12:55.804
So, they are
keeping him over night

01:12:56.738 --> 01:13:01.540
for resisting arrest and
assaulting a police officer.

01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:03.976
He's gonna plead
guilty, on the condition

01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:07.649
that they drop charges
on the rest of us.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.119
My hero.

01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:30.702
Do you have er...
anything to drink?

01:13:30.704 --> 01:13:32.507
Er... Sure.

01:13:48.222 --> 01:13:49.625
Um, vodka orange?

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:51.492
Perfect.

01:14:04.238 --> 01:14:06.474
- Do you mind if I smoke in here?
- No, it's cool.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.199
Show me your moves.

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:35.201
I've got one move.

01:14:35.203 --> 01:14:36.302
What's your move?

01:14:36.304 --> 01:14:40.039
Ready? That's all you get.

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:41.610
That's what you get. That's it.

01:14:45.779 --> 01:14:47.682
I don't really dance
to this kind of stuff.

01:15:20.113 --> 01:15:21.849
Sorry... I'll move this...

01:15:23.618 --> 01:15:24.553
It's OK.

01:18:03.277 --> 01:18:05.846
Umm, it's me. Call me back.

01:19:33.466 --> 01:19:36.000
- Chill out.
- Is Twiggy here?

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:38.102
- No.
- Do you know where she is?

01:19:38.104 --> 01:19:39.039
Fucking hell.

01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:40.909
Umm...

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:43.512
She's not here.

01:20:11.572 --> 01:20:15.206
Hey, hey, hey. I saw Twiggy.

01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:17.045
She said she was going back
to her folks' place.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.981
Look, the address is on there.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.885
- Thank you.
- It's all right. Good luck.

01:21:41.462 --> 01:21:44.062
Look, Twiggy,
pick up the phone.

01:21:44.064 --> 01:21:45.165
Don't ignore me, please.

01:23:41.148 --> 01:23:44.817
- Oh, my God.
- Bloody hell. What the hell is going on?

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:46.652
Oh, my goodness!

01:23:51.225 --> 01:23:53.459
Leon. Leon, man.

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.861
- What the fuck are you doing, bruv?
- What the fuck!

01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:57.662
What the fuck
are you even doing here?

01:23:59.332 --> 01:24:01.165
- Get the fuck away from me.
- No, please, no.

01:25:42.269 --> 01:25:43.404
- Hey.
- Oh!

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.973
- Hey, yo. You guys got your ballies yeah?
- Yes.

01:25:47.975 --> 01:25:50.778
- Fuck no!
- Man, you didn't bring one either?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.479
They're going to be able to recognise
you with that big scar on your face.

01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:58.185
Are you mad? There's CCTV
everywhere, you sausage.

01:26:05.658 --> 01:26:09.561
Listen, listen, listen,
listen. You all gone crazy?

01:26:14.902 --> 01:26:17.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A man
might get lost out there, init.

01:26:17.704 --> 01:26:22.273
I'm just saying that. I got
love for you all still, init.

01:26:22.275 --> 01:26:23.275
Shut up...

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:33.598
Fuck off, fuck off.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.001
Get the fuck off me bruv! Fuck off! Get
the fuck off me bruv! Are you dumb, bruv?

01:29:37.003 --> 01:29:38.903
Are you fucking mental?
