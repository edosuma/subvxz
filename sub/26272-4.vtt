[man coughing]

00:03.786 --> 00:07.007
How do you explain
the inexplicable?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.834
You don't.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.184
You just...

00:10.227 --> 00:12.273
surrender to it.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.709
You move on.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.842
Why? Because...

00:16.886 --> 00:18.148
[sighs]

00:18.192 --> 00:20.281
...what other choice is there?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.241
The thing about Cable though,
if you knew her,

00:24.285 --> 00:26.156
you'd know...

00:26.200 --> 00:27.592
[exhales]

00:27.636 --> 00:30.030
...she wasn't easy
to move on from.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.554
She wasn't easy to quit.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.078
Take it from me. I hired her.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.472
I fired her.
I hired her again.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.126
[soft laughter]

00:39.169 --> 00:40.953
[sighs]
But, hey,

00:40.997 --> 00:44.087
Cable wouldn't want us
to cry too hard

00:44.131 --> 00:46.089
or cry too long.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.700
She would want to know
that we all got together

00:48.744 --> 00:51.051
at her favorite hang,

00:51.094 --> 00:53.444
had a bunch of beers,

00:53.488 --> 00:55.098
put some...

00:55.142 --> 00:59.450
of her favorite songs
on the jukebox...

00:59.494 --> 01:03.019
and remembered
all those nutty T-shirts.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.111
To Cable.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.808
ALL:
To Cable.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.290
If there's anything
I can do,

01:13.334 --> 01:16.511
anything at all,
don't hesitate to call.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.605
What?

01:23.648 --> 01:26.434
That's okay. I can have
my husband take care of it.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.179
[sniffles]

01:32.222 --> 01:35.791
The police called last night.

01:35.834 --> 01:40.535
They recovered some things
from the car.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.363
From her...

01:42.406 --> 01:44.191
They said I could come
pick 'em up, but I...

01:44.234 --> 01:45.366
It's okay.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.367
We can do that.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.977
We'll take care of that.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.197
And then we can bring them
to you.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.547
Or not.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.984
Whatever you decide.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.769
DANNY:
Hey, Marissa, can you put

01:57.813 --> 01:59.206
the TV on?

02:00.207 --> 02:01.817
Channel 3.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.558
And if you are just joining us,

02:03.601 --> 02:06.517
we have a late-breaking
development to tell you about.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.128
According to investigators,
they now believe

02:08.171 --> 02:10.956
a single member
of the 40-person crew

02:11.000 --> 02:12.828
performing routine maintenance

02:12.871 --> 02:15.613
on this bridge
less than three weeks ago

02:15.657 --> 02:17.528
embedded plastic explosives

02:17.572 --> 02:20.140
and a remote timer
in one small section

02:20.183 --> 02:22.533
of the bridge's undercarriage.That's the bridge
that Cable...

02:22.577 --> 02:23.969
The question now is,

02:24.013 --> 02:25.971
if this wasn't a case
of infrastructure failure,

02:26.015 --> 02:27.756
but rather an act

02:27.799 --> 02:30.498
of sabotage, perhaps even an act
of terrorism,

02:30.541 --> 02:32.935
who was behind it and why?

02:32.978 --> 02:36.591
I don't have an answer, Ellen.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.420
It's a horrible world.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.509
We do unspeakable things
to each other.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.858
I wish...

02:42.901 --> 02:46.209
I understood why.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.993
Absolutely.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.081
Whatever you need.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.170
Whatever the hour.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.172
I'm here.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.564
You call.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.480
[exhales]

02:56.524 --> 02:58.917
I'm not gonna drop dead
from a sip of whiskey.

02:58.961 --> 02:59.918
You don't know that.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.311
I might kill you.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.705
[groans softly][knocking]

03:03.748 --> 03:05.533
Did you tell him?He was on the phone.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.926
Tell him what?They found
the terrorists.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.624
Found the cell.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.105
Where? When?

03:13.149 --> 03:14.629
They were all killed.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.673
Somewhere in Prague.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.415
And according
to reports,

03:18.459 --> 03:21.853
no one is taking credit for
the bridge collapse on purpose.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.248
They wanted to make it look
like an accident.

03:25.292 --> 03:28.773
They wanted to make us afraid of
everything we take for granted.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.949
During the raid,
they found

03:30.993 --> 03:32.951
plans for, uh, 25 more--

03:32.995 --> 03:35.302
what did they call those--
events.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.086
Now they're
checking all over

03:37.129 --> 03:38.914
the country to make sure
that none of those

03:38.957 --> 03:40.655
were put into motion.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.267
So what do we do now?

03:44.311 --> 03:46.269
Nothing. Nothing.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.315
There's-there's nothing
we can do.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.318
Leave here,
we get in an elevator,

03:51.361 --> 03:53.972
we hope that no one
has messed with it.

03:54.016 --> 03:57.019
We get on the subway,
and we hope that's safe, too.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.328

04:02.677 --> 04:05.984
You know, they've won.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.335
They've taken that
certainty away from us.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.902
They've taken away
our confidence.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.124
And they've taken Cable.

in the morning.

04:34.491 --> 04:37.277
BULL: I just kept thinking
about what Benny said.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.062
How there was nothing to do.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.153
Nothing to do but embrace fear.

Sorry about the intrusion.

No, you're not.

I'm Jason. I'm her...

05:13.965 --> 05:14.923
I know who you are.

05:14.966 --> 05:19.014
This midnight caller thing,

05:19.057 --> 05:20.798
you do this a lot?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.452
No.Yes.

05:22.496 --> 05:25.194
You want something
stronger than that?

05:25.237 --> 05:27.196
No.Yes.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.198

So, here's my question.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.287
How do you do this?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.941
Plastic explosives.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.812
Remote timers.
Passports.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.248
20-some other events.
Training.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.511
It all costs money, right?

05:37.554 --> 05:39.077
I mean,
you have to house people.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.383
You have to feed people.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.993
Okay...

05:42.037 --> 05:44.953
So... [exhales] where does
all this money come from?

05:44.996 --> 05:46.955
Maybe
a foreign government

05:46.998 --> 05:48.130
somewhere.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.392
Yeah.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.220
But how do you get it here?

05:51.263 --> 05:52.613
To America.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.224
How do you pay for all
this stuff, all these people?

05:55.267 --> 05:58.227
You need credit cards,
bank accounts, cash.

05:58.270 --> 06:01.404
Sounds like you
need... a bank.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.232
Bingo.

06:03.275 --> 06:06.061
Marissa, you must know someone
at the U.S. attorney's office

06:06.104 --> 06:07.932
that specializes
in terrorism.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.195
I do. But, Bull,
the terrorists are all dead.

06:10.239 --> 06:13.155
Who is it you're looking
to go after?

06:14.199 --> 06:17.159
The folks that killed Cable.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.945
The folks who helped pay
for that bridge to come down.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.947
They bank
with Thoreau Financial.

06:22.991 --> 06:26.298
A grand old 120-year-old
American bank

06:26.342 --> 06:28.953
with branches
all over the world.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.129
Your mom and dad probably had
a mortgage with them.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.131
So why aren't you guys
over there right now,

06:33.175 --> 06:35.482
guns blazing, throwing whoever's
allowing this to happen

06:35.525 --> 06:37.484
into prison?

06:37.527 --> 06:40.312
Well, we would if we could.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.968
Thoreau Financial was
actually investigated

06:44.012 --> 06:46.318
by the Senate Banking
Committee in 2010.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.885
Then again in 2014.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.234
Then again last year.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.280
They were cleared
of any wrongdoing

06:51.323 --> 06:53.108
each and every time.[sighs]

06:53.151 --> 06:54.979
But how is that possible?

06:55.023 --> 06:58.461
You know, when my old
Homeland buddy Marissa called

06:58.505 --> 07:02.160
and asked me if I'd meet
with the great Jason Bull,

07:02.204 --> 07:06.077
I never would've guessed what
a babe in the woods you'd be.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.470
Was that meant to offend me?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.298
Never been called a babe before.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.386
[chuckles]

07:10.430 --> 07:13.084
Have you ever heard
of John Honaker?

07:13.128 --> 07:15.435
He's the CEO of Thoreau.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.088
Basically, he isThoreau.

07:17.132 --> 07:20.440
He bought it in 2008
after the financial crisis.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.094
He took a string of small
mom-and-pop community banks

07:23.138 --> 07:25.445
and he built it into
a multibillion dollar

07:25.488 --> 07:27.011
financial institution.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.231
No, you'll never get Thoreau.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.233
People have tried.
I've tried.

07:31.276 --> 07:34.105
You bring down
Thoreau Financial

07:34.149 --> 07:37.500
and the repercussions will
affect the entire economy.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.676
So that's that?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.722
That is that.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.942
What about that guy?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.117
What guy?

07:46.161 --> 07:47.641
The guy who runs it all.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.120
Honaker?

07:49.164 --> 07:51.209
What if I just went after him?MARISSA: This is

07:51.253 --> 07:54.474
John Honaker, the CEO
of Thoreau Financial.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.650
This is what he had to say
on television this morning.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.130
All of us at Thoreau Financial
were shocked when we learned

07:59.174 --> 08:01.263
earlier today
that the terrorists responsible

08:01.306 --> 08:04.658
for that bridge collapse
apparently used our bank

08:04.701 --> 08:07.661
to facilitate
their horrific activities.

08:07.704 --> 08:10.011
To be clear, we are in contact

08:10.054 --> 08:13.362
with Homeland Security,
the CIA, the NSA,

08:13.405 --> 08:14.842
and both local and
international law enforcement.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.191
We're going to do
everything we can

08:16.234 --> 08:17.758
to get to the bottom of this,

08:17.801 --> 08:20.500
to try and understand why
it happened, how it happened,

08:20.543 --> 08:23.241
and to make sure that nothing
like this ever happens again.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.809
In the meantime,
our prayers and sympathies

08:25.853 --> 08:28.420
are with the victims
and their families.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.161
And according to Bull,

08:30.205 --> 08:32.816
he's our target.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.341
We're not
prosecutors.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.343
We can't bring any criminal
charges against him.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.737
And as far as a
civil lawsuit goes,

08:40.781 --> 08:43.261
we cannot sue on
Cable's behalf.

08:43.305 --> 08:46.351
We are her employers,
not her family.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.268
Seems like
a fairly minor technicality.

09:01.802 --> 09:05.283
Why would I say no?

It might be painful.

be there every day.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.304
I will pay for everything.

Still...

I love my husband.

he's not Cable's real father.

but if you want

11:05.708 --> 11:08.624

11:08.668 --> 11:11.279

11:37.044 --> 11:40.917
Tomorrow? In the morning,
as opposed to later tonight?

11:40.961 --> 11:42.353
Oh, come on.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.746
That was fun.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.922
And yes, you'll see
me in the morning

11:45.966 --> 11:48.620

I'm Taylor.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.826
Taylor Rentzel.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.828

at Homeland.

tonight's the night

13:55.922 --> 13:58.663

Oh. Was that him

14:10.414 --> 14:14.288
Actually, uh, moron's
kind of pretty, too.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.594
This is Ivan Gronsky,
and as I'm sure you've read,

14:16.638 --> 14:18.901
he's the leader of the cell
that took down that bridge.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.339
Right. And he was killed along
with the rest of his cell

14:22.383 --> 14:24.559
during the CIA
raid in Prague.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.126
Right you are.Mm-hmm.

14:26.169 --> 14:30.086
So why are we wasting our time
talking about a dead man?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.741
Because-- at least the way
Marissa explained it to me--

14:32.784 --> 14:35.570
you're trying to prove
that this guy personally used

14:35.613 --> 14:37.137
his bank to launder money

14:37.180 --> 14:38.834
so the bad guys could do...

14:38.878 --> 14:40.183
bad things.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.185
That is the working
theory, yes.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.448
So I've been looking
for points of intersection

14:44.492 --> 14:47.756
between this guy and anyone
connected with this cell.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.845
And by "points
of intersection,"
you mean...?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.847
Any time banker fellow
and anyone from the cell

14:51.891 --> 14:54.502
might have been
at the same place
at the same time.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.720
Or, in this case,

at the same time.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.334
Okay.And as it happens,

15:00.377 --> 15:02.118

a six-month period,

15:02.162 --> 15:05.165
Mr. Gronsky lived in America.

Really? And what
was he doing here?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.823
He spent a semester
at an Ivy League school.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.434
Do tell.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.871
And guess who else
attended the same school,

but at the same time?

15:45.205 --> 15:46.989

15:47.033 --> 15:49.252
because I'm not allowed
to do this if there is.

to meet you.

Ms. George,

16:26.942 --> 16:28.335

to dismiss,

16:28.378 --> 16:31.033
all 220 pages of it.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.209
If I could trouble you
to restate your argument--

16:33.253 --> 16:36.169
briefly-- as to why
I should dismiss this case?

16:36.212 --> 16:37.909
Thank you, Your Honor.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.607
And let me begin by saying

16:39.650 --> 16:41.913
that our hearts go out
to the victims

16:41.957 --> 16:44.960
of the I-99 Bridge collapse
and to their families.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.658
But while we grieve
for the victims,

16:47.702 --> 16:49.921
we take strong exception
to the assertion

16:49.965 --> 16:52.054
that Mr. Honaker
is somehow involved

16:52.098 --> 16:53.577
or personally responsible.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.623
And given
the complete lack of evidence

16:55.666 --> 16:58.191
to support such
an outrageous assertion,

16:58.234 --> 17:01.063
dismissal seems like
the only just course of action.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.718
Mr. Colón,
you haven't presented the court

17:03.761 --> 17:05.067
with much information.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.113
Yes, we know that, Your Honor.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.464
Unfortunately, all of the
relevant transactional records

17:10.507 --> 17:13.119
are in the possession
of Thoreau Financial.

17:13.162 --> 17:16.644
All we're asking for is a chance
to examine their records.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.212

of a fishing expedition.

wrong with fishing.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.018
They're entitled to the truth.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.634

I'm allowing this

come up with more than this,

I won't hesitate
to pull the plug.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.466

19:58.980 --> 20:01.112
This trial's
about banking and coding

20:01.156 --> 20:02.462
and transactions and details.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.377
We need people who are
gonna be able to absorb

20:04.420 --> 20:06.379
bits of minutiae and
not be overwhelmed.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.119
Which means
Honaker's lawyers

20:08.163 --> 20:09.512
will be looking
for the opposite--

20:09.556 --> 20:11.253
jurors with short
attention spans.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.387
People who, when confronted
with the enormity

20:14.430 --> 20:17.259
of complicated evidence,
will tune out.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.044
Do you own a
smartphone, sir?

20:20.088 --> 20:21.524
It's a phone.

20:21.568 --> 20:25.267
Okay. And has anyone ever
texted you a photo on it?

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
Yeah. I-I think.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.706
BENNY: All right. Well,
let's just assume someone has,

20:29.750 --> 20:32.753
and let's assume that you
wanted to share that photo

20:32.796 --> 20:34.276
with juror number eight.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.279
Can you take me through
the steps involved

20:37.323 --> 20:39.934
for you to re-text
that photo?

20:41.283 --> 20:42.545
No.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.201
You touch the picture,
and you drag it to his phone.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.463
And how do you do that?

20:47.507 --> 20:51.293
You just... you just drag it
as hard as you can.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.729
WOMAN:
You touch it,

20:52.773 --> 20:54.862
the picture or the text message
you're trying to send.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.472
That highlights it.
Once it's highlighted,

20:56.516 --> 20:58.126
an icon will appear
with the arrow.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.520
You highlight that,
and a dialogue box

21:00.563 --> 21:03.523
will appear asking for the phone
number you want to text to.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.743
You enter the phone number,
and you press send.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.357
BENNY:
Okay.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.401
I've got a riddle.

21:12.445 --> 21:13.837
Your Honor...

21:13.881 --> 21:15.099
I like riddles.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.405
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:16.449 --> 21:20.322
Now, a man has a fox, a duck,

21:20.366 --> 21:21.802
and a bag of beans.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.370
And he has to get them
across the river,

21:24.413 --> 21:25.806
but he can only
take one at a time.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.156
Now, if he leaves the
fox with the duck,

21:28.199 --> 21:29.462
the fox will eat the duck.

21:29.505 --> 21:30.898
If he leaves the
duck with the beans,

21:30.941 --> 21:32.856
the duck will
eat the beans.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.467
How is he...?

21:36.338 --> 21:37.905
I'm getting rid of all of them.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.994
Wait, why? They know the answer.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.040
No. They just think they do.
There is no answer.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.477
[mouthing]

21:47.654 --> 21:50.265
So, here's the good news.
You have a case.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.050
The bad news is
it's a circumstantial case.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.270
We've won with
circumstantial.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.054
Well, you won't win
with this one.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.795
The terrorist accounts
should have been red-flagged

21:58.839 --> 22:00.493
by the bank's own
internal auditing system,

22:00.536 --> 22:01.798
and they weren't.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.365
A problem with the program?

22:03.409 --> 22:04.932
I'm sure that's what
they want you to think.

22:04.975 --> 22:07.978
But then I found 71
other suspicious activity alerts

22:08.022 --> 22:10.198
that the bank was all over,
immediately.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.373
But not Gronsky's.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.593
Not Gronsky's.BULL:
You find any

22:13.636 --> 22:15.595
direct connection between
Honaker and the terrorist?

22:15.638 --> 22:17.640
Now that you mention it,

22:17.684 --> 22:20.469
apparently Honaker was in Panama
with a group of bankers

22:20.513 --> 22:22.558
two days after that bridge
came down.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.039
And that matters because...?

22:26.083 --> 22:28.608
I cheated. I ran an NSA check.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.828
Gronsky was off the grid
at that time,

22:31.872 --> 22:34.614
and the soft intel suggests
he was probably in Panama.

22:34.657 --> 22:35.789
MARISSA:
That's really great.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.356
But it's still not conclusive.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.879
We made a point to pick a jury

22:38.922 --> 22:40.402
that would pay attention
to the details,

22:40.446 --> 22:42.839
follow a fact pattern,
not leap to conclusions.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.972
[phone chimes]We really need proof.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.582
Hard proof.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.411
Sorry to eat and run.
My day care closes

22:49.455 --> 22:51.021
in 25 minutes.
I'll be in early tomorrow.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.284
7:30-ish. Nice to
meet you, Danny,

22:53.328 --> 22:55.025
Benny, Chuck.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.158
Chunk.[chuckles]

22:57.201 --> 23:00.553
Well, other than screwing up
my name, she's very impressive.

23:00.596 --> 23:01.989
Yeah, nice work, Marissa.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.034
Well, we only have her
for one more day,

23:04.078 --> 23:05.862
so let's use her while we can.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.344
Anything else
on the investigative front?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.520
Yeah, I've got something.
So, I've been tracking down

23:11.564 --> 23:13.740
former employees who might
be able to shed some light

23:13.783 --> 23:15.306
on Honaker and Thoreau,

23:15.350 --> 23:17.221
and I found
this independent contractor

23:17.265 --> 23:19.702
who was hired to write
banking code for Thoreau.

23:19.746 --> 23:23.445
His specialty is defeating
governmental safeguard systems.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.620
Bingo.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.535
You think he'll talk to us?Well,

23:26.579 --> 23:28.015
everyone I've approached

23:28.058 --> 23:29.408
with any connection
to the company

23:29.451 --> 23:31.671
is either afraid to speak
or has signed an NDA.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.238
Including this guy, Adam Shaw.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.936
CHUNK:
I-I don't get it.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.112
If he won't speak to us--
if he can'tspeak to us...

23:38.155 --> 23:41.071
Well, the thing is, uh,
he's dying.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.943
Stage IV lymphoma.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.945
Well, nothing to lose.

23:44.988 --> 23:47.295
Chuck, bring him in.
Do your magic.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.040
I know you had me served
with a subpoena,

23:53.083 --> 23:56.783
but I'm honestly not sure
I can be of any help to you.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.785
I only worked at Thoreau
for nine months.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.875
Oh, let me be the judge
of that, Mr. Shaw.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.573
So, you write code?When I'm well enough

24:04.617 --> 24:08.055
to work, which is not
terribly often these days.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.839
I'm sorry.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.233
Can I ask you
about John Honaker?

24:12.276 --> 24:13.669
About Thoreau Financial?

24:15.715 --> 24:18.979
Y-You know I'm-I'm not supposed
to tell you anything.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.895
You know
they made me sign an NDA.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.723
Yeah, but...

24:23.766 --> 24:26.900
I know you know
there are 37 people dead.

24:26.943 --> 24:30.817
And a lot of times,
that changes things.

24:33.341 --> 24:36.518
BENNY: Mr. Shaw, how
did you come to apply

24:36.562 --> 24:38.085
for a job at Thoreau?

24:38.128 --> 24:39.869
ADAM:
I-I didn't apply

24:39.913 --> 24:42.219
for the job.
They-they sought me out.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.612
And when you say "they"...?

24:43.656 --> 24:47.268
I was... I was hired directly
by Mr. Honaker.

24:47.311 --> 24:49.575
He seemed to know
exactly who I was

24:49.618 --> 24:51.881
and exactly what I did.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.754
And this was shortly after
the terrorist Ivan Gronsky

24:54.797 --> 24:56.625
opened up his accounts
at Thoreau?

24:56.669 --> 24:59.019
That's correct.And at that time,

24:59.062 --> 25:03.284
did Mr. Honaker explain
to you exactly what he wanted?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.460
He couldn't have been
more specific.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.768
Uh, my first assignment
was to create a backdoor code.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.118
And for those of us
who don't speak computer,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.554
what is a backdoor code?

25:12.598 --> 25:15.818
I-It's a type of bypass key.

25:15.862 --> 25:19.213
Um, it's a piece of code
created specifically

25:19.256 --> 25:22.433
to work around
the regulatory protocols

25:22.477 --> 25:24.305
set up by the U.S. government

25:24.348 --> 25:28.135
to detect
suspicious transactions.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.442
Everybody following along?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.183
They're hanging on
his every word.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.011
BENNY: That must have raised
some concerns for you.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.492
I mean, the president

25:37.536 --> 25:40.800
of a bank asks you to
create some software

25:40.843 --> 25:43.585
so that he can defeat
government safeguards.

25:43.629 --> 25:44.804
I mean...

25:44.847 --> 25:47.807
yes and no.
I guess it should have.

25:47.850 --> 25:51.593
The truth is
that I didn't specifically know

25:51.637 --> 25:53.682
what they were going to use
the code for.

25:53.726 --> 25:57.643
Sometimes banks keep it
as a... fail-safe.

25:57.686 --> 26:00.820
They know a transaction is good,
and they don't want

26:00.863 --> 26:04.650
the government freezing it
or flagging it.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.695
I mean, I didn't

26:06.739 --> 26:10.394
specifically know
that Thoreau was going to use it

26:10.438 --> 26:14.181
to thwart the AML
or KYC protocols.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.966
Again, a little help, sir.

26:17.010 --> 26:20.796
[chuckles] AML are
anti-money laundering programs.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.582
KYC stands for
"know your clients."

26:23.625 --> 26:27.673
Uh, every bank
is required to have them.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.632
Okay, so you create this code.

26:30.676 --> 26:34.505
And how did you come to realize
that it was being abused?

26:34.549 --> 26:37.726
I take pride in my work.
I would dip into the system

26:37.770 --> 26:40.729
and monitor it from time to time
just to make sure

26:40.773 --> 26:43.645
that there wasn't anything
going wrong.

26:43.689 --> 26:46.387
Just to get ahead
of any potential problems.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.171
And that's how you became aware

26:48.215 --> 26:50.696
of what the bank
was really doing with the code.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.742
Yeah. And I reported it
immediately.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.309
Who did you report it to?

26:57.485 --> 27:00.749
Hey, Mr. Shaw, it's okay.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.493
To him. To John Honaker.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.755
[gallery murmuring]

27:06.799 --> 27:08.017
MARISSA:
Things are getting

27:08.061 --> 27:10.672
really green
with our mirror jury.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.413
The real one's buying it, too.

27:12.456 --> 27:16.722
You realize that you're
breaking your NDA

27:16.765 --> 27:19.507
by testifying with us today?Of course.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.683
But I'm dying.

27:21.727 --> 27:25.513
What are they gonna do to me?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.167
Nice work, Counselor.Thank you.

27:27.210 --> 27:31.345
By any chance would
you gentlemen be free right now?

27:31.388 --> 27:35.262
For you? Never free.
Always available.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.307
My offices.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.836
It's a shame
we didn't have a towel.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.707
We could have handed it
to her here and now

27:45.751 --> 27:48.101
so she could throw it in.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.972
Have Marissa call
Cable's mother.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.061
Put her on high alert
to come to court tomorrow.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.367
Will do.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.505
You understand this
is a nuisance case

28:01.549 --> 28:03.638
for my bank. Period.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.728
It's bad PR, but PR
is highly perishable.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.991
All it takes is a couple
of news cycles and...

28:09.035 --> 28:10.689
What's it doing
for your stock price?

28:10.732 --> 28:12.560
How many shares
does he personally control?

28:12.603 --> 28:14.344
15 million.Ooh.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.781
And every dollar
it goes down...

28:15.824 --> 28:17.217
If you're suggesting
that I put

28:17.260 --> 28:18.784
my personal net worth over
the safety of others...

28:18.827 --> 28:19.959
That's not for us to decide.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.656
We're comfortable
leaving it to the jury.

28:23.049 --> 28:26.966
We'll pay your client
$25 million to settle.

28:27.009 --> 28:30.317
Obviously, I'm obliged to share
your offer with my client,

28:30.360 --> 28:32.711
but I will strongly advise her
to reject it.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.757
If you'll excuse me, have a
moment with my partner here.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.933
And she does tend
to take my advice.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.718
I'm trying to be
reasonable here.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.807
I'm trying to put
this all behind us.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.766
Oh, well...

28:44.810 --> 28:46.812
what do you know,
it's not there.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.378
What do you want?

28:48.422 --> 28:50.250
I want him to hurt.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.165
The way my client
is gonna hurt

28:52.208 --> 28:54.907
every time she walks
by her daughter's bedroom.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.866
The way those families
are hurting.

29:07.702 --> 29:11.880
Mr. Colón,
any idea why your witness

29:11.924 --> 29:14.143
has chosen not to grace us
with his presence?

29:14.187 --> 29:17.277
Uh, Your Honor, I know
that Mr. Shaw was most anxious

29:17.320 --> 29:18.931
to be cross-examined,

29:18.974 --> 29:21.020
and I know
that with his illness,

29:21.063 --> 29:22.804
mobility can sometimes
be an issue.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.806
We expect him any minute now.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.329
I will give him
another three minutes.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.375
Yes, Your Honor.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.732
[whispering]:
Talk to me.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.299
He's dead.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.736
What?I went to his apartment
to pick him up,

29:41.780 --> 29:43.912
and the ambulance
was already there. EMTs.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.871
The cleaning lady
found him.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.961
Mr. Colón? Dr. Bull?

29:49.004 --> 29:50.832
So, the judge gave us

29:50.876 --> 29:53.879
a continuance
until tomorrow.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.098
He's also giving the
jury a stern instruction

29:56.142 --> 29:58.361
to disregard all of
Shaw's testimony.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.972
Well, there you have it.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.714
Can I ask a really
horrible question?

30:03.758 --> 30:06.195
Does anyone think
it's just a coincidence

30:06.239 --> 30:08.589
that that poor man
was found dead this morning?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.852
For what it's worth,
everyone at the scene

30:10.896 --> 30:12.723
believed they were looking
at natural causes.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.813
There wasn't even a hint
of anything criminal.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.119
From your lips.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.948
TAYLOR:
Knock, knock.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.518
What you thinking, Lincoln?

30:26.694 --> 30:28.957
Someone looks unhappy.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.568
I thought we were finished
with you.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.570
How'd you get in here?

30:33.614 --> 30:36.704
I was over at Homeland,
and I stumbled across something

30:36.747 --> 30:38.271
I thought
you might find interesting.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.664
Told Marissa all about it and...

30:40.708 --> 30:42.144
And she gave you
her credentials.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.754
Doesn't she know that goes
on your permanent record?

30:43.798 --> 30:46.888
Doesn't she know she's not gonna
get into a good college now?

30:46.932 --> 30:50.065
Why do you look so sad?

30:50.109 --> 30:54.026
Our key witness,
a whistleblower Danny found,

30:54.069 --> 30:58.030
suddenly died before he could
complete his testimony.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.641
I'm sorry.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.644
Pulmonary embolism.

31:03.687 --> 31:07.300
I had one of those
a few months ago.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.910
I heard.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.870
Fun fact:
if you want to poison somebody,

31:11.913 --> 31:13.697
always choose
potassium chloride.

31:13.741 --> 31:18.050
Leaves no trace and presents
as pulmonary embolism.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.531
Oh, my God.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.969
This guy Honaker
helped kill Cable.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.709
I'm pretty sure
he killed my witness.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.973
And it looks like...

31:28.016 --> 31:31.150
he's gonna go scot-free.

31:31.193 --> 31:34.849
But that's not why you came here
in the middle of the night.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.895
Is that for me?

31:36.938 --> 31:39.549
Yeah, but...
[sighs]

31:39.593 --> 31:42.030
now I'm not sure
if it's gonna help or hurt.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.902
Try me.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.907
Remember I told you
I had soft intel that suggested

31:48.950 --> 31:51.083
Honaker and Gronsky
were together in Panama?

31:53.737 --> 31:56.088
This is two days
after the bridge collapse

31:56.131 --> 31:58.133
in Panama City.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.094
BULL:
Oh, my God.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.922
This is great.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.969
This changes everything.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.406
It does, and it doesn't.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.366
I cheated again.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.846
I got that by hacking
into an NSA server.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.848
You can't use it.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.111
If you introduce that photo,

32:19.154 --> 32:21.243
I'll be behind bars
in a matter of days.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.202
Well, why'd you bring it to me?

32:23.245 --> 32:25.465
I just...

32:25.508 --> 32:28.033
sensed how badly
you needed to know.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.992
You were right all along.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.212
I thought it was important.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.128
I'm sorry.

32:40.132 --> 32:43.091
Dr. Bull...

32:43.135 --> 32:45.093
you can't use it.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.486
I understand.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.096
Can I have it, please?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.619
No.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.752
I think
you should probably go now.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.024
[sighs]

33:11.815 --> 33:13.382
There's not a day gone by
since the tragedy

33:13.426 --> 33:15.602
when I haven't wondered what
we could have done differently.

33:17.299 --> 33:20.433
And what have you determined?I believe,

33:20.476 --> 33:22.826
we honestly did
the best we could.

33:22.870 --> 33:27.222
You know, we handle over a
thousand transactions a second.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.659
The possibility
that we might miss

33:29.703 --> 33:32.227
one errant financial anomaly,
one exchange,

33:32.271 --> 33:35.230
though infinitesimally small,

33:35.274 --> 33:38.712
obviously still exists.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.322
And that's no excuse.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.324
We have to do better.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.412
We willdo better.

33:43.456 --> 33:46.241
To begin with,
we've taken down

33:46.285 --> 33:48.635
Mr. Shaw's code,
and we are in the process

33:48.678 --> 33:52.030
of setting up
far more rigorous protocols.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.075
Thank you, Mr. Honaker.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.208
Nothing further.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.557
Cross-examination?

33:57.600 --> 34:00.386
Yes, Your Honor.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.738
[sighs]

34:06.131 --> 34:08.524
Just to clarify.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.744
It sounds like you're suggesting

34:10.787 --> 34:13.921
that the fault lies
not with the bank,

34:13.964 --> 34:16.837
and by extension,
not with you,

34:16.880 --> 34:21.233
but with the coding created
for you by the late Adam Shaw.

34:21.276 --> 34:24.453
I take no pleasure
in speaking ill of the dead,

34:24.497 --> 34:26.890
but clearly,
his work was flawed.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.370
Aah.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.981
I don't know if I follow that.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.288
I mean,
he didn't make the software

34:33.332 --> 34:35.899
that was supposed
to spot the transactions.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.988
The government did that.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.513
He made the software
that allowed you

34:40.556 --> 34:42.906
to circumvent
the government safeguards.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.083
Objection. Is counsel going
to ask a question,

34:45.126 --> 34:46.606
or simply pontificate
for the jury?

34:46.649 --> 34:48.129
I apologize, Your Honor.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.523
And yes, I-I do have a question.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.481
[sighs]

34:52.525 --> 34:55.136
Are you certain
you don't know an Ivan Gronsky,

34:55.180 --> 34:58.705
the terrorist leader
who took down the bridge?

34:58.748 --> 35:01.447
No. I do not.

35:01.490 --> 35:03.971
As I've stated numerous times.

35:11.457 --> 35:15.809
So, if you don't know
Ivan Gronsky,

35:15.852 --> 35:18.159
then how do you explain
this photo...

35:18.203 --> 35:19.421
Oh, my gosh.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.857
Bull, you can't do that.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.989
BENNY:
...which was

35:22.032 --> 35:25.471
taken in Panama two days

35:25.514 --> 35:28.169
after the I-99 collapsed?

35:28.213 --> 35:31.825
That's you, isn't it,

35:31.868 --> 35:34.219
with Mr. Gronsky,

35:34.262 --> 35:36.090
together,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.397
a week before the CIA
and Interpol took

35:38.440 --> 35:40.050
him and the rest
of his team out?

35:40.094 --> 35:41.965
Objection!
We've never seen this photo.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.793
We have complied
with the court order

35:43.837 --> 35:45.143
to turn over our documents.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.841
For the plaintiff
to sandbag us like this

35:47.884 --> 35:49.973
is beyond the pale.Counsel, my chambers,

35:50.017 --> 35:51.105
now.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.324
Dr. Bull,

35:52.367 --> 35:53.586
you, too.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.372
There's no foundation
for this photo whatsoever.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.200
It could have
been photoshopped.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.289
Okay, then. Mr. Colón,

36:01.333 --> 36:03.683
Dr. Bull,

36:03.726 --> 36:05.206
one of you had better tell me

36:05.250 --> 36:07.208
where this photograph
came from now.

36:09.732 --> 36:12.170
It just surfaced this
morning on a small website.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.389
Probably being
picked up by all the

36:14.433 --> 36:16.565
major media outlets as we speak.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.742
For all we know, members
of the jury are looking at it

36:19.786 --> 36:22.354
on their phones
while we're back here fighting.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.312
Can't control the media.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.532
As for the veracity
of the photograph,

36:26.575 --> 36:28.011
may I suggest,
Your Honor,

36:28.055 --> 36:29.796
that since her client is
already on the stand,

36:29.839 --> 36:31.624
why don't we ask him
to authenticate it?

36:31.667 --> 36:33.191
He knows
whether it's him or not,

36:33.234 --> 36:36.063
and he certainly knows
whether he was there.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.807
You're right.
Of course he does.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.896
Let's get back in there.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.767
It's a simple question, sir.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.769
Is that you in
the photo or not?

36:46.813 --> 36:49.163
I'd... have to study it
to say for sure.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.556
Really?

36:50.599 --> 36:51.905
That's what you're going with?

36:51.948 --> 36:53.254
You know what you look like,
don't you?

36:53.298 --> 36:54.386
Objection.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.822
Withdrawn.

36:55.865 --> 36:58.041
I'll concede,
it looks like me.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.173
Looks like you?

36:59.217 --> 37:00.653
[laughs]
Okay.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.611
All right.
All right, we'll go with that.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.787
Uh... let me

37:04.831 --> 37:06.354
ask you another question.

37:06.398 --> 37:09.314
Uh, this guy who looks like you?

37:09.357 --> 37:11.229
He looks pretty angry
in this picture.

37:11.272 --> 37:14.362
Is it because his
terrorist buddy

37:14.406 --> 37:17.278
who'd been limiting
his activities

37:17.322 --> 37:21.195
to Eastern Europe
suddenly killed 37 Americans?

37:22.805 --> 37:25.373
I mean, that must have

37:25.417 --> 37:28.246
reallyturned up the heat
on you and the bank.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.987
[laughing]:
I'm sorry.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.989
I mean... the heat

37:33.033 --> 37:35.078
on the guy in this photo

37:35.122 --> 37:37.298
who looks exactly like you.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.823
No answer?

37:40.867 --> 37:42.825
I understand.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.871
It's a lot to digest.

37:44.914 --> 37:48.657
But while
you're thinking about it...

37:48.701 --> 37:50.920
let me ask you.

37:50.964 --> 37:55.185
How much did you and the bank
make with Gronsky?

37:55.229 --> 37:56.317
I don't know off-hand.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.971
Well, according
to our analysis,

37:58.014 --> 38:01.322
he moved hundreds of millions of
dollars a year through Thoreau.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.367
[gallery murmuring]

38:02.410 --> 38:04.543
Funding from foreign
governments,

38:04.586 --> 38:06.806
ransoms.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.462
Over the last decade,
over a billion dollars.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.246
HONAKER:
Again,

38:12.290 --> 38:14.117
I can't verify those numbers.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.642
What about your year-end bonus
this past year?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.687
Can you verify that?

38:20.733 --> 38:22.735
$80 million.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.128
BENNY:
$80 million.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.436
$80 million. Wow.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.917
Whew!

38:30.960 --> 38:35.835
37 dead Americans
driving over that bridge,

38:35.878 --> 38:39.055
trying to get home
to their loved ones.

38:40.448 --> 38:42.450
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:48.151 --> 38:50.110
JUDGE:
Has the jury reached a verdict?

38:50.153 --> 38:52.286
We have, Your Honor.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.377
In the above entitled action,
we find for the plaintiff

38:56.421 --> 39:00.294
in the amount
of $100 million.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.560
[kisses]

39:07.693 --> 39:09.651
Thank you.

39:09.695 --> 39:13.002
Thank you... for
letting us do this.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.439
Oh, my God.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.266
We did it.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.356
And you.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.096
You were amazing.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.533
Oh, Cable was.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.230
This was for her.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.275
Yeah.
[kisses]

39:30.237 --> 39:32.848
[sighs]

39:37.244 --> 39:39.812
Hmm. I wish this felt better.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.424
He doesn't look
too unhappy.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.427
Pocket change for him.

39:46.471 --> 39:50.562
Just... wait a second.

39:50.605 --> 39:53.086
John Honaker.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.655
You're under arrest

39:56.698 --> 39:59.832
for providing material aid
to terrorists, resulting

39:59.875 --> 40:01.355
in multiple deaths.[handcuffs clicking]

40:01.399 --> 40:03.270
[scoffs]

40:06.360 --> 40:09.276
You feel better now?

40:09.319 --> 40:12.845
Yeah. I guess I do.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.456
[laughs]

40:34.519 --> 40:36.477
[sighs]

40:36.521 --> 40:40.829
You know, everyone at
TAC still thinks it was me

40:40.873 --> 40:43.441
that slipped that photo to
that anti-banking website.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.268
Girl has
to protect herself.

40:45.312 --> 40:48.358
Soon as I realized you weren't
gonna give me the picture back,

40:48.402 --> 40:50.273
I had to come up
with a plausible reason

40:50.317 --> 40:51.884
why it was out there.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.712
Classic Homeland move,
by the way.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.497
Using a news outlet
to launder a photograph?

40:56.541 --> 40:58.194
Oh.

40:58.238 --> 40:59.935
I may steal
that from you.
Hmm.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.981
Unless, of course,
you've changed your mind

41:02.024 --> 41:03.678
and want to come
work for me,

41:03.722 --> 41:06.072
in which case
there'd be no point.

41:07.943 --> 41:10.555
Well... that depends.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.297
If I hadn't done what I did,

41:14.341 --> 41:17.344
would you have sold me out?

41:17.387 --> 41:19.389
Would you have used that photo?

41:22.349 --> 41:24.351
I think you would have.

41:24.394 --> 41:28.486
I think nothing matters more to
you than getting the bad guys.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.621
I'm sorry.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.668
Of course...

41:36.711 --> 41:39.453
this bad guy
had done something...

41:39.497 --> 41:42.717
awful to a member
of your team.

41:42.761 --> 41:45.285
You were seeking justice
for her.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.330
Nothing for yourself.

41:48.897 --> 41:52.292
I'd love to work for someone
who sticks up for me like that.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.948
Excuse me?

41:57.515 --> 42:00.387
I've already discussed money and
benefits and hours with Marissa.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.563
Hours? We don't do hours.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.347
I do.

42:04.391 --> 42:07.394
But I promise you
you and your company will be

42:07.437 --> 42:09.788
the second most important thing
in my life.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.487
Second.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.750
That's all I have to offer,

42:15.794 --> 42:18.448
and I'm offering it to you.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.450
Sold.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.540
BOY:
Mommy?

42:23.889 --> 42:27.022
I believe you're being
summoned by Number One.

42:27.066 --> 42:31.331
I believe he might have
just donea number two.

42:31.374 --> 42:32.593
See you Monday.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.682
See you Monday.
