Oh, Brad.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.024
Oh, Brad.

01:48.691 --> 01:49.526
Brad.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.402
Brad.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.573
It's time, sweetie. Say goodbye.

01:56.616 --> 02:00.495
We talked about this.
You have stunning taste, babe.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.580
Like <i>Architectural Digest</i>
all over the place,

02:02.580 --> 02:04.582
but the black leather
is way too masculine.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.751
Yeah. The couch, right?

02:06.751 --> 02:07.919
Yes, the couch.

02:11.589 --> 02:16.010
Do you hear that? The weeping
of the ghosts of girlfriends past.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.012
Brad.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.933
God knows what gymnastics
have been performed on that thing.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.434
Hm...

Honey, what's going on?

02:55.049 --> 02:58.219
Something's not right.
I know you. Is it the couch?

02:59.053 --> 03:01.014
It's blush, not pink.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.642
I know it reads pink,
but it's not like girl pink.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.894
It's very chic.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.688
It was Pantone's color of the year.
It's like a neutral now.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.857
No, it's not the couch.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.112
I know
this has been your place for so long,

03:16.112 --> 03:20.617
but I'm so excited
to make it our place for our family.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.084
Me too.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.005
Oh, yeah? Well, wait until you see
this gorgeous wallpaper I found.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.840
It has hand-painted azaleas.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.758
For...?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.719
The bedroom. Duh. You're gonna love it.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.055
I gotta get out of here.

03:42.805 --> 03:43.973
Oh...

03:43.973 --> 03:47.268
No. I need to go to work.
I'll see you later.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.899
I love you, Brad Simon.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.986
I love you too.

04:03.034 --> 04:09.415
After suffering emotional trauma,
we... crave stability and security.

04:09.415 --> 04:14.087
And so we make choices that...
we believe will keep us safe.

04:15.213 --> 04:20.134
And these choices are solutions
and they do work... for a while.

04:20.134 --> 04:26.307
But, um... sometimes...
our choices can have unexpected...

04:28.935 --> 04:30.853
even disastrous consequences.

04:46.452 --> 04:51.666
So the key
is to address the root of the problem,

04:51.666 --> 04:56.754
the underlying assumptions
and behavior patterns

04:56.754 --> 04:58.715
that led to all that trauma...

05:00.091 --> 05:01.217
in the first place.

05:03.845 --> 05:08.099
Okay. All right, let's--
Let's leave it there for today. Okay?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.439
-  Hey, I gotta run.
-  Yeah.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.190
I got another class at 10:00.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.400
Yes? Oh, thank you.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.244
Billie.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.838
Brad?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.723
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.977
You're with Majid now?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.480
How is that possible?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.065
I left Cooper.

05:57.690 --> 06:02.945
- When?
- The night... I came to your place.

06:02.945 --> 06:06.240
You were right. I needed to figure out
what I wanted out of my life,

06:06.240 --> 06:10.745
but also,
Cooper didn't give me much of a choice.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.873
We're separated.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.417
In the middle of a divorce.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.294
It's not pretty.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.923
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, there was no reason to.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.552
You're with... Gigi.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.224
And I'm happy for you, truly.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.606
So, what about Majid?

06:39.982 --> 06:41.776
Are you gonna keep seeing him?

06:44.362 --> 06:45.196
I...

06:45.947 --> 06:49.742
- I know I have no right to ask. I'm sorry.
- No.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.455
I don't know what I'm gonna do, you know?
This is all just...

06:57.125 --> 06:57.959
a lot.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.505
I should go.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.008
I have to get home to Connecticut.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.343
It's my turn with the kids.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.142
I cannot believe this is where we are.

07:27.071 --> 07:31.409
We are completely screwed.
They told me not to come in till 3:00.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.494
- What time did they tell you?
- 3:30.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.914
Shit. That's not a good sign.
They fire people at the end of the day.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.832
<i>Don't go there.</i>

07:37.832 --> 07:40.460
This is an embarrassing blip that will end
with a slap on the wrist

07:40.460 --> 07:42.336
- if they know what's good for them.
- That's why

07:42.336 --> 07:43.880
they're keeping us out of the office?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.631
<i>Yeah, to make a point. Come on.</i>

07:45.631 --> 07:49.010
I've watched so many overgrown frat boys
at Goldman do way worse.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.387
This will become a war story.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.597
<i>Office legend.</i>

07:53.723 --> 07:54.807
I'm so sorry.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.436
- This is all my fault.
<i>- Hey.</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:00.188
I was there too.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.400
Uh, give me a sec. Olga!

08:05.985 --> 08:08.279
I gotta go. I'll see you later.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.703
Well, I am a very happy agent.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.040
The Soledad segment
exploded on Twitter and TikTok.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.791
Hashtag "independent woman for life"

08:20.791 --> 08:23.544
was the number one trending topic
all afternoon.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.880
- I'm not even on TikTok.
- Someone clipped it.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.009
- Whoa.
- And Rihanna followed you.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.054
- Badgalriri?
- Mm-hm.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.224
My publicist is gonna
cream over this.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.850
I'm creaming right now.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.855
Wait. Paisley, where are we going?
I thought your office was on ten.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.733
But Mick's is on 30.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.699
Mick, this is Sasha Snow.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.245
You'll do great.

09:02.208 --> 09:06.420
I've been thinking a lot about Jesus.
Not that I'm a religious man.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.341
Holy fuck shit,
the guy started with 13 followers.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.510
Today, he's got 7 billion.

09:12.510 --> 09:17.473
You know, people talk about Google, Apple,
Amazon, and their amazing campuses.

09:18.849 --> 09:23.396
The Apple campus
is a fucking WeWork donkey stall

09:23.396 --> 09:25.356
compared to Vatican City.

09:25.856 --> 09:30.528
Florence, Rome, that's a campus.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.904
I love Rome.

09:31.904 --> 09:37.410
Jesus was the greatest brand
the world has ever seen.

09:37.410 --> 09:42.248
The popes ruled Europe
even though they didn't have an army.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.834
You know why? 'Cause they didn't need one.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.002
They had words.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.088
They were selling an idea.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.215
Salvation.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.134
Changed the world.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.428
Amen.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.432
- Oh.
- Sasha.

10:01.267 --> 10:06.439
You are a very special writer.
I was reading your book.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.317
Well, actually, the first chapter,
then my bagel was ready.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.361
But my wife, she read the whole thing

10:12.361 --> 10:16.657
and she and her friends
haven't stopped yakking about it.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.911
Then I saw you on TV
and I realize you have a rare voice.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.707
You're a very gifted B-team player.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.542
I'm a <i>New York Times</i> best seller.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.628
What is that, 70,000 books?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.712
Not interested.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.839
Guess what, neither is the world.

10:31.839 --> 10:35.217
Yes, Soledad's got 3 million viewers.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.638
That's still a fucking prayer circle
compared to Gwyneth.

10:39.221 --> 10:44.143
Seven million followers showing up
to buy her vagina-scented candles.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.395
Still a drop in the ocean
compared to Reese.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.023
Twenty-six million.

10:49.023 --> 10:49.940
Oprah?

10:50.816 --> 10:51.651
Forty million.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.194
Michelle Obama?

10:53.194 --> 10:54.487
Seventy million.

10:55.029 --> 10:55.863
But you...

10:58.324 --> 11:01.577
should not worry because you
have something that those women do not.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.579
- A PhD?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.374
You're so adorable. No, me.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.753
I can get you to the next level,
but you have to want it.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.338
You have to taste it.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.048
And I mean every fucking day.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.383
You have to think big.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.300
I get that.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.386
And I do.

11:25.226 --> 11:29.355
Sasha, I can get you a seat at that table.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.192
But it's not enough to sell your brand.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.946
As Jesus taught us, you have to live it.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.825
You have to... be it.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.578
Then and only then...

11:46.372 --> 11:47.706
the world will listen.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.210
What do you say?

12:18.946 --> 12:19.947
Olga, Ellary?

12:20.698 --> 12:23.242
- Where are you, baby?
-  We're in here.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.743
Holy shit.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.661
Mom.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.539
- Well, that's pleasant.
- What are you doing here?

12:29.373 --> 12:30.624
And why aren't you at work?

12:31.375 --> 12:34.003
Well, I decided to stay
and chat with Vivian,

12:34.003 --> 12:36.046
who flew in for a surprise visit.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.175
And you couldn't have called?
Either of you?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.845
You know, we had a very...

12:46.140 --> 12:48.017
enlightening conversation.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.897
You really think
you should be talking to my mother?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.482
Oh, give Cooper a break.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.193
He's got a lot on his plate.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.110
Thank you.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.237
Where's Ellary?

13:01.238 --> 13:04.909
Olga took her to the park.
I should head in.

13:05.701 --> 13:09.497
- Why don't you come back for dinner later?
- Mom. No.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.292
- Been so long since we all shared a table.
-  That's not how this works.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.377
This is my time with Hudson and Ellary.

13:15.377 --> 13:19.924
Protected time on which Cooper and I
agreed through very expensive lawyers.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.800
This arrangement is absurd.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.513
Being a part-time parent,
leaving a stranger to fill in the gaps.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.432
Olga's not a stranger
and her living here provides consistency,

13:28.432 --> 13:30.976
which is exactly what the kids need now.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.772
In my day,
Mother provided that consistency.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.441
Hmm. Indeed.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.279
Have a nice visit.
Vivian, such a pleasure.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.449
- I'm glad we got a chance to talk.
- Yes, me too, darling.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.582
You have always been your own worst enemy.

13:53.582 --> 13:58.629
- You sure about that?
- Cooper is a good man and a great father.

13:58.629 --> 14:03.133
And you are not gonna do better.
You need to find a way to get him back.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.683
Oh...

14:14.061 --> 14:17.147
Who's Majid? Body not even cold yet.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.817
You're already spreading your legs
for some other man?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.110
Fuck you!

14:25.531 --> 14:26.991
I should go unpack.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.743
I think we both need a minute.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.039
No.

14:35.207 --> 14:39.211
There's been too much unsaid for too long
that's had too much of an effect on me.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.422
What on earth are you talking about?

14:42.673 --> 14:46.051
Whenever something bad happens,
I hear your voice in my head

14:46.051 --> 14:47.469
telling me it's all my fault.

14:47.469 --> 14:51.181
- I've made huge mistakes in my life.
- You have made mistakes.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.560
Your sexual appetite has been a problem
since you were a teenager

14:54.560 --> 14:56.478
and now it's tanked your marriage.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.440
No, no. My desire was never
the problem in my marriage.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.652
My problem was dishonesty, and the source
of that dishonesty was shame.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.406
And it was shame that you taught me.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.124
I have to pick up my son.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.966
Hi. Sasha Snow. I'm here for Doc--

15:25.966 --> 15:27.176
Dr. Evans?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.178
Honey, aren't we all?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.226
Sasha Snow for Dr. Evans.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.955
<i>♪ Do what I say ♪</i>

15:57.873 --> 15:59.625
<i>♪ Do what I say ♪</i>

16:03.212 --> 16:06.465
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.763
Boy, what are you doing?

16:13.597 --> 16:16.433
Mm, mm, mm!

16:17.434 --> 16:19.603
I'm getting ready to make love to my wife.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.897
I'm not your wife yet.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.484
Woman, you were always my wife.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.987
You just didn't know it yet.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.280
<i>♪ You know you like it now ♪</i>

16:33.117 --> 16:33.951
Sasha.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.163
You're back.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.709
- Can we talk?

16:53.637 --> 16:57.808
I need to tell you why I left.
And why I won't be back.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.395
Not exactly the reunion I was expecting.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.359
I've spent the last 17 years
hustling my ass off.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.861
Solo.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.281
And I've loved every second of it,

17:12.281 --> 17:17.536
but this morning, I met an agent
who wants to take me to the next level.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.205
You're already next level.
<i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

17:20.205 --> 17:24.543
No. Women with a voice
are being heard by millions now.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.128
Not thousands.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.672
I need to focus on climbing that mountain.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.468
I can't get... distracted again.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.386
Again?

17:35.554 --> 17:36.597
I distracted you?

17:36.597 --> 17:41.226
When you asked me to move to California,
you were asking me to give up my dreams.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.521
- That is not at all what I was asking.
- Come on, Kam.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.358
It was your grad program,
your career, not mine.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.236
We-- We were doing it together.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.157
Not really.
We were doing what worked best for you.

17:55.157 --> 17:59.286
I kept sacrificing my needs,
my future, to fit into yours.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.163
And if I kept doing that, if--

18:02.998 --> 18:04.958
If I went to California with you,

18:05.709 --> 18:07.920
I would never have made it
to where I am now.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.554
I've been to that place.

18:19.515 --> 18:24.228
That place where everything in your career
is going right, after years of struggle,

18:24.228 --> 18:28.440
and you just keep pushing yourself
to see how high you can climb

18:28.440 --> 18:35.405
until one day, you find yourself
literally on top of Kilimanjaro,

18:35.405 --> 18:41.120
looking out across the Eden-like plains
of Africa in all its stunning glory,

18:42.371 --> 18:44.123
and you turn to say,

18:44.123 --> 18:47.835
"Isn't this the most beautiful place
you've ever seen?"

18:51.505 --> 18:54.049
Only there's no one there to hear you,

18:54.049 --> 18:57.761
and you've got to experience
all of that beauty...

18:59.513 --> 19:00.389
alone.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.352
I'm not asking you to sacrifice anything.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.690
What I am saying
is why not try for it all?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.949
Are you free for a drink?
You can run away anytime you want.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.709
This day just keeps getting more insane.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.211
You've got this.

19:36.425 --> 19:40.929
There's no question that what Francesca
and I did represents very poor judgment.

19:40.929 --> 19:45.225
Still, ours is a completely consensual
relationship between two adults--

19:45.225 --> 19:47.436
Let me stop you right there, Cooper.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.188
Mm-hm.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.107
You've been a standout contributor
to this firm

19:52.107 --> 19:56.320
considering how much business,
and frankly, profit you've brought in.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.406
We've decided to let you go...

20:01.200 --> 20:02.284
with a stern warning.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.582
Oh...

20:10.209 --> 20:12.502
Oh, Dave. Thank you.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.380
I deeply appreciate
this vote of confidence.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.216
You will not regret this.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.974
- What happened?
- You were right.

20:26.934 --> 20:27.768
We're golden.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.821
Okay, let's do the lamb shawarma
but, yeah, as a taco.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.200
- Okay.
- Use the fresh mint salsa, but I think--

20:43.200 --> 20:44.117
Majid.

20:45.911 --> 20:46.912
Hey, man.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.166
Um, Eva, will you give us a minute?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.254
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm good.

20:59.841 --> 21:00.676
Listen.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.138
You got to believe
I had no idea Billie was your ex.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.475
It's crazy what a small town this city is.

21:09.101 --> 21:09.935
Sure.

21:10.811 --> 21:15.691
Still, I understand if you're pissed,
wanna pull your investment.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.192
That's not why I'm here.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.446
Look, I told you I believed in you.
That hasn't changed.

21:24.741 --> 21:28.161
But I do have to ask,
what are your intentions with Billie?

21:30.998 --> 21:32.291
My intentions?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.420
I don't know. I just met her.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.298
My intentions were to see her again,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.967
but I haven't heard from her
since she ran off last night.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.011
So who knows what's gonna happen.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.679
Maybe nothing.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.848
But truth...

21:48.932 --> 21:52.561
I think she's amazing.
So I'm not going down easy.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.481
That gonna be a problem for you?

22:01.403 --> 22:02.779
Just don't fuck with her.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.710
Billie. Hey, how are you?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.128
<i>Hey, one call, four texts.</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:20.339
<i>I'm still within
totally normal non-stalker range.</i>

22:21.131 --> 22:23.425
<i>- Am I right?</i>
- Yes. Yes.

22:23.425 --> 22:28.263
You're lovely in a very non-stalker way,
and I'm flattered, but...

22:29.097 --> 22:30.057
<i>I can't do this.</i>

22:32.684 --> 22:33.518
You could.

22:34.394 --> 22:37.022
I mean, if you tried really, really hard.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.191
No, look, I'm--

22:41.943 --> 22:43.445
I was honest with you

22:43.445 --> 22:45.280
<i>about what a mess my life is,</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:49.076
and things have--
They've just gotten worse.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.287
- I know it's weird, but Brad and I--
<i>- It's not just that.</i>

22:52.871 --> 22:54.081
My mother's in town.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.918
And having her here

22:57.918 --> 23:01.922
<i>has brought up a lot of stuff,
you know, not just about Brad,</i>

23:01.922 --> 23:05.509
but about me, about the choices I've made.

23:05.509 --> 23:10.055
I get it. I know all about evil moms
who make you question life choices.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.139
Yeah.

23:11.139 --> 23:14.017
<i>Whatever you've done,
whatever your part in it,</i>

23:14.017 --> 23:17.521
that doesn't mean
you don't deserve to eventually move on.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.399
- And at least try to find happiness.
-<i>I don't know.</i>

23:21.983 --> 23:23.193
Maybe I'm not ready.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.655
Maybe I'm just too broken.

23:26.655 --> 23:27.572
Billie.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.369
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
<i>- No. Billie, wait--</i>

23:34.579 --> 23:36.665
- Hudson!
-  Mommy!

23:37.165 --> 23:39.626
Hi, baby! Oh...

23:40.627 --> 23:42.379
- Oh!
- I missed you so much.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.965
Oh, I missed you too.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.807
What--? Francesca, hey.
What happened? Are you okay?

23:53.807 --> 23:54.975
No, I'm not okay.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.518
I'm fired.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.854
What? That's impossible.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.438
I have to go clear out my office,

24:00.438 --> 24:02.524
they're sending up security
to escort me out.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.901
No, no, no. Okay?

24:06.444 --> 24:08.530
No. This can't happen. I won't let it.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.575
Cooper, please.
I don't want to make this a thing.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.160
It already is.

24:17.747 --> 24:18.957
Hey!

24:19.541 --> 24:21.209
Total bullshit move, Dave.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.461
This is sexism straight up.

24:23.461 --> 24:27.132
Francesca abused her power
as a senior executive.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.926
It was the both of us, not just her.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.470
She was your boss, Cooper.
She knew the rules.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.014
So did I.

24:34.014 --> 24:38.685
We can't have managers
who can't even manage themselves.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.814
- She got a very generous package.
- No. No!

24:45.025 --> 24:46.067
Don't fire her.

24:47.777 --> 24:48.695
Fire me.

24:48.695 --> 24:49.613
Cooper.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.032
And if you won't fire me...

24:54.075 --> 24:55.118
then I quit.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.371
- Cooper, stop it. This is crazy.
- No. They're crazy.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.876
This? This is real.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.390
Do you want a snack?
Are you hungry, baby? No? You ate?

25:18.934 --> 25:22.187
There he is. My big boy.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.814
I have missed you so much!

25:24.814 --> 25:26.775
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, honey.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.110
You're still here.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.072
You didn't think I would leave
without saying goodbye, did you?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.740
A girl can dream.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.783
Hi, Olga.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.119
Hello, my sweet girl.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.037
Mommy missed you.

25:39.037 --> 25:43.208
Olga, perhaps you can take the children
upstairs for their bath.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.585
I'd like to speak to my daughter. Alone.

25:45.585 --> 25:49.839
I think we've said enough to each other
for another 25 years or so.

25:49.839 --> 25:54.636
- Don't you think?
- Billie, please, I want to apologize.

25:57.347 --> 25:58.974
I need you to understand...

26:00.934 --> 26:03.270
I'm not the person that you think I am.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.439
At least, I wasn't always.

26:15.156 --> 26:18.868
Mm! Oh, my God.
I can't get over how amazing you were.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.829
So commanding.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.080
So forceful.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.623
So hot.

26:25.709 --> 26:26.918
Fuck those assholes.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.338
Cooper, I don't even know
who you are right now.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.633
Come on.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.888
Oh, believe it or not, growing up...

26:40.348 --> 26:42.225
I was a lot like you.

26:42.225 --> 26:45.061
Interested in boys and sex...

26:47.105 --> 26:49.816
at a time when we were all
supposed to be good girls.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.901
Isn't that all the time? Even now?

26:51.901 --> 26:54.696
You have no idea
what it was like back then.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.948
What is that supposed to mean?

26:59.993 --> 27:04.497
I got caught with one of those boys
that I was so crazy about.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.415
A quarterback.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.294
We snuck off after a game to his car,

27:09.294 --> 27:11.504
thought nobody would see,

27:11.504 --> 27:14.924
and my classmates branded me a slut.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.636
And that never went away.

27:19.804 --> 27:20.889
Not even at home.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.184
My mother made sure of that.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.522
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.694
Because you're not the only one
who felt shame.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.284
I love you, Billie.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.162
No matter what you think.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.667
All I've ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.672
Then I need you to understand...

27:57.509 --> 28:01.054
that trying to fix my marriage
with Cooper is not the way.

28:03.765 --> 28:07.102
Right or wrong... Cooper is in my past.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.563
And so is Brad.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.527
And is this Majid your future?

28:18.988 --> 28:19.989
I don't know. I--

28:22.367 --> 28:25.412
I haven't... had the chance to find out.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.872
Things are complicated.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.333
Honestly, I'm scared.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.255
But I wanna be happy. And I want my--

28:37.549 --> 28:39.384
I want my kids to see me happy.

28:42.595 --> 28:46.808
And if I can do that,
then maybe all of this will have been...

28:48.268 --> 28:49.227
worth it.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.607
Then go to him.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.486
What?

28:58.486 --> 29:01.364
You got a nanny
and a grandma in the house.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.366
That's plenty of consistency.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.203
Stop being afraid.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.165
Go find out what your life can be.

29:13.543 --> 29:15.253
When I was at the Cleveland clinic,

29:15.962 --> 29:19.090
I worked on the first face transplant
in the U.S.

29:19.883 --> 29:23.136
- Oh, my God, Kam. That's incredible.
- Yeah.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.013
Finally getting to see her smile.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.182
It was one of
the happiest days of my life.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.518
One of? Come on.
What else could even come close?

29:30.518 --> 29:32.103
My thought exactly,

29:32.103 --> 29:37.567
until a buddy of mine invited me
to Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis.

29:37.567 --> 29:42.906
I got a taste of what it's like
to help people on a global scale and...

29:44.449 --> 29:45.575
And I never looked back.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.744
I am so proud of you, Kam.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.538
What you've done with your life--

29:50.538 --> 29:53.249
And you're still here.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.712
- Mm-hm.
- Shall we move on to dinner?

30:01.174 --> 30:03.551
That seafood risotto does look slamming.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.937
- Oh, uh-- Excuse me. I have to take this.
- Of course. Absolutely.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.689
Mick!

30:16.689 --> 30:18.024
Started your new book?

30:19.025 --> 30:20.026
What new book?

30:20.026 --> 30:24.781
The one I just sold to Random House
for 500 grand.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.618
I soft pitched them a follow-up
to <i>The Third Way.</i>

30:28.618 --> 30:31.830
A follow-up?
I don't even know if there is one.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.831
Oh, there is.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.708
It's called <i>Unattached.</i>

30:35.708 --> 30:38.211
<i>You're pitching it tomorrow at 9 a.m.</i>

30:38.211 --> 30:40.129
That-- That's in like 15 hours.

30:40.755 --> 30:44.259
Picasso averaged three paintings a day.
Just saying.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.347
- Everything all right?
- Perfect.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.600
But I have to go.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.646
Apparently, I just sold a new book.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.733
- What? Sash, congrats.
- Thanks!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.361
Now, all I need is an idea,

31:03.361 --> 31:07.407
plus a beginning, middle and end...
all by tomorrow morning.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.366
So...

31:09.909 --> 31:10.994
Now you're gonna run.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.287
I'm sorry.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.290
I'll walk you home.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.835
-  Majid.
- Hey, good to see you, man.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.794
Hey, man.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.421
- Next round's on me, okay?
- Thanks.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.673
Need you, boss.
Table 3 is asking for the owner.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.259
- What's the problem?
- Some issue with the hummus.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.746
It will not happen again.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.250
I couldn't stop thinking
about that kiss, either.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.756
I ordered the expensive stuff.

32:05.882 --> 32:09.218
Hope there might be
a friends and family discount?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.763
You think this is nice?

32:12.513 --> 32:16.184
The rep from Chateau Musar
is doing a tasting for my sommelier.

32:17.143 --> 32:17.977

You know the Persians invented winemaking
over 7,000 years ago?

33:52.530 --> 33:53.948
I did not know that.

33:55.324 --> 33:59.746
Legend has it,
there was a beautiful princess

34:00.621 --> 34:02.665
who lost favor with King Jamshid.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.046
Overwhelmed with pain and sorrow,
she tried to poison herself

34:08.046 --> 34:10.757
by drinking from a jar of spoiled grapes.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.176
She got drunk...

34:13.176 --> 34:14.969
- Yeah.
- ...fell asleep,

34:16.054 --> 34:20.516
woke up the next morning
feeling no longer depressed

34:20.516 --> 34:23.311
but rejuvenated.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.104
She took her discovery to the king,

34:25.938 --> 34:27.190
regained his favor...

34:30.359 --> 34:31.944
and the rest is history.

34:33.529 --> 34:34.489
You're adorable.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.034
You are...

34:40.161 --> 34:41.245
fearless.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.506
So at the risk of pushing
my clearly-winning luck,

34:51.506 --> 34:52.882
I gotta ask you something.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.803
There's one more bottle
I want to share with you,

34:57.512 --> 34:59.097
but it's back at my place.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.475
What do you think?

35:03.601 --> 35:05.978
Haven't been here in a minute.

35:05.978 --> 35:10.233
I still remember coming up these stairs
hearing you play your gran's old LPs.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.400
Stevie Wonder.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.152
<i>- Hotter Than July!
- Hotter Than July!</i>

35:14.779 --> 35:15.905
We wore that record out.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.699
I remember every scratch and pop.

35:21.285 --> 35:25.581
Listen, I know you gotta work
and I want you to.

35:26.749 --> 35:28.835
And I get it, you're on your road,

35:28.835 --> 35:33.881
and you don't have time
for detours or crazy Waze shortcuts.

35:36.509 --> 35:39.387
But the truth is, you and I
are trying to get to the same place.

35:41.222 --> 35:45.017
We both want to change the world, Sash.
Make our voices heard.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.521
So why not double the horsepower?

35:49.105 --> 35:50.439
We'll get there faster.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.276
Let's take this ride together.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.948
I better go.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.585
Okay.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.714
Good luck with your book.

36:20.928 --> 36:21.762
You know what?

36:23.014 --> 36:25.766
Fuck it. I still got 14 hours.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.560
Wait, no way.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.271
I will not be the reason
you don't finish your pitch.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.772
You need to kill it tomorrow.

36:31.772 --> 36:35.151
And I intend to, but first...

36:36.569 --> 36:37.653
I'm gonna do this.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.294
Are you sure?

36:53.294 --> 36:55.254
What? You gonna take all night?

36:56.672 --> 36:57.506
Maybe.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.894
Wow, look at this place.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.272
It's my first and only apartment
in the city.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.111
- Why would you ever leave?
- Exactly.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.615
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

37:23.866 --> 37:27.495
When I could finally afford a place
that wasn't on wheels,

37:27.495 --> 37:29.664
I found this day one.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.582
Fixed it up.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.253
New York gods were smiling on me.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.510
Guess they still are.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.363
I'm sorry.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.993
- No, I'm moving too fast, I know.
- No, it's not that. It's just...

38:09.370 --> 38:16.377
I-- I haven't been touched
by anyone but my husband...

38:17.545 --> 38:19.046
in nine years.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.258
No one else has even seen me naked
since having kids.

38:22.258 --> 38:27.221
So what we're about to do is thrilling.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.224
Um, it's also scary as hell.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.979
I'm sorry. This is not
what you wanna hear on the second date.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.398
This is exactly what I wanna hear.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.401
Something real.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.988
We don't have to do this.

38:45.698 --> 38:46.949
At least not tonight.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.661

42:18.494 --> 42:19.828

42:49.441 --> 42:52.570
Of course. It's--
That's absolutely what I want.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.825
I just need some time.

43:00.619 --> 43:02.496
Take all the time you need.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.666

43:07.251 --> 43:08.836

43:49.209 --> 43:51.128

43:51.128 --> 43:52.755

43:55.466 --> 43:57.051

43:57.885 --> 43:59.303

44:06.226 --> 44:09.021

44:10.481 --> 44:13.567

46:10.309 --> 46:11.894
Dr. Kim sent them over.

46:11.894 --> 46:15.022

which one to get blown up and framed.

46:15.606 --> 46:19.026
I think they'll look great in the nursery,
or maybe our bedroom.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.081

46:34.374 --> 46:36.168
