21:00.058 --> 21:02.094
{\an1}HEY, TIMMY,
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.029
IT SOUNDS LOUD
AND DANGEROUS.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.299
{\an4}HEY, BOVINE ARMY.
HI, MOOSE.
HI, ROCCO.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.201
NO TIME.
WAND OUT OF WISHES.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.603
I WISH EVERYTHING
WAS BACK TO NORMAL.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.940
{\an1}WE TOLD YOU TO USE THE WAND
FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.610
{\an5}AND YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D ALWAYS BE THERE
FOR ME, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.222
WHEW!
THANKS, GUYS.

21:30.288 --> 21:31.690
THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.359
{\an5}GUESS I'LL
BE GETTING

21:38.163 --> 21:39.598
{\an5}TIMMY,
WHEN YOU RAN
OUT OF WISHES,

21:39.665 --> 21:41.400
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST CALL US?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.934
WELL, YOU'RE SO BUSY
WITH POOF,

21:43.001 --> 21:46.138
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO BE BOTHERED WITH ME ANYMORE.

21:46.204 --> 21:49.107
{\an1}WE'RE TO BLAME,
TOO, SPORT.

21:49.174 --> 21:52.811
{\an5}WE'VE REALLY BEEN
IGNORING YOU LATELY,
AND WE'RE SORRY.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.247
{\an5}BUT JUST BECAUSE
WE HAVE A NEW BABY
DOESN'T MEAN

21:55.313 --> 21:57.416
THAT YOU'RE ANY LESS
IMPORTANT TO US.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.186
{\an4}WE'RE ALL A FAMILY
AND WE ALWAYS WILL BE.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.186
REALLY?

22:01.253 --> 22:04.389
{\an1}YES. NOW WE HAVE TO GET
OUR PHOTO TAKEN AND--AAH!

22:04.456 --> 22:07.025
{\an1}OH, NO! WE'VE MISSED
OUR APPOINTMENT!

22:07.092 --> 22:10.262
{\an1}AND IT TAKES 10,000 YEARS
TO GET ANOTHER ONE,

22:10.328 --> 22:13.331
{\an1}AND I LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:13.398 --> 22:14.900
THEN ALLOW ME.

22:14.966 --> 22:18.136
I WISH YOU WERE ON TIME
FOR THE FAMILY PHOTO!

22:23.575 --> 22:25.977
AH, THERE YOU ARE,
RIGHT ON TIME.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.679
IS THE WHOLE
FAMILY READY?

22:27.746 --> 22:29.314

22:44.796 --> 22:48.100
{\an4}WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
DO IT WITHOUT YOU, TIMMY.
WE LOVE YOU!

22:48.166 --> 22:49.634
TIMMY.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.337
{\an1}YOU MEAN YOU WANTED ME
IN THE PICTURE THE WHOLE TIME?

22:52.404 --> 22:55.607
{\an4}THEN HOW COME YOU WEREN'T
YELLING AT ME TO GET DRESSED
OVER AND OVER?

22:55.674 --> 22:58.910
BECAUSE YOU WERE DRESSED,
AND YOU NEVER BARF, POOP,

22:58.977 --> 23:02.881
{\an1}OR SPIT UP ON YOURSELF
LIKE THESE TWO.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.588
