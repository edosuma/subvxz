-Here we go!
-Come on, come on!

00:35.118 --> 00:37.078
All right,
everybody got their ticket?

00:37.162 --> 00:40.999
Then get ready for today's
super-Barto jackpot drawing.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.546
Come on, cantaloupe.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.174
And 'round
and 'round she...

00:49.257 --> 00:50.133
Uh-oh.

No refunds.
Force majeure.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.438
Read the back of your ticket.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.193
(groaning)
Oh... $900?

01:08.276 --> 01:11.571
Well, we'll have to dip into
the retirement fund again.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.659
(grunting)

01:21.498 --> 01:23.083
(clattering)

01:23.166 --> 01:24.167
Aw, nuts.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.252
Hello?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.378
China?

01:27.462 --> 01:28.880
A little help?

01:28.963 --> 01:31.674
Well, I never thought
it would come to this,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.134
but I guess
we'll have to sell

01:33.218 --> 01:34.761
Grandma's Civil War doll.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.554
Mom, are you sure
you want to sell

01:36.638 --> 01:39.265
a family heirloom
to pay the gas bill?

01:39.349 --> 01:40.975
I mean, what would
your grandma say?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.352
I'm sure
she'd be proud

01:42.435 --> 01:44.771
that her descendants
had piping hot tap water

01:44.854 --> 01:46.815
and plenty of warm,
dry underwear.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.150
That is so true.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.451
Hmm, these campaign buttons
are all partisan.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.411
Don't you have
any neutral ones?

02:00.495 --> 02:01.830
"May the better man win"?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.331
"Let's have a good,
clean election"?

02:03.414 --> 02:04.833
That sort of thing?

02:04.916 --> 02:07.168
No, but we do have
some old shirt buttons.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.753
They're kind of kooky
and fun.

02:08.837 --> 02:09.879
Missy, you just
talked yourself

02:09.963 --> 02:11.714
right out of a sale.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.928
Hey, Lise, check it out,
pogo stilts.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.806
These were banned
in all 50 states.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.935
HOMER: Ow! Ohh!
What happened?

02:24.018 --> 02:26.563
Wow, an actual robot
from the movie

02:26.646 --> 02:27.897
"Clank, Clank,
You're Dead."

02:29.566 --> 02:30.859
Think of how awful
it would be

02:30.942 --> 02:32.735
for the poor
midget inside.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.903
Oh, boo-hoo.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.530
That's what they
get paid for.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.785
(gasps)

02:40.869 --> 02:42.704
Oh, Homer, look!

02:42.787 --> 02:45.123
A TV guide
owned by Jackie O!

02:45.206 --> 02:47.125
Oh, you should see
the crossword puzzle.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.794
She thought that Mindy
lived with "Mark."

02:49.878 --> 02:51.796
Give her a break.
Her husband was killed.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.840
Oh, I know.
Wasn't that awful?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.550
Hi, I'm John.
Can I help you with anything?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.428
Yes, I have something
that I'd like to sell.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.846
Please tell me
it's your hair.

02:59.929 --> 03:00.847
(giggling)

03:00.930 --> 03:02.974
No. It's an heirloom

03:03.057 --> 03:04.434
my grandmother
passed down to me,

03:04.517 --> 03:07.437
a very rare old figurine
from the Civil War.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.105
Please don't construe
our ownership of this

03:09.189 --> 03:10.982
as an endorsement
of slavery.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.692
Hmm.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.444
Well, see,
here's the thing on this.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.405
It's a Johnny Reb bottle,
early 1970s.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.532
One of the J&R Whiskey
"Liquor Lads."

03:19.616 --> 03:21.784
Two books of green stamps,
if I'm not mistaken.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.161
Oh, no.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.496
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.249
It's a very,
very old figurine.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.335
No, it's a liquor bottle.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.420
See?

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
Ah, that will make
your bull run.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.094
(murmuring sadly)

03:40.178 --> 03:42.096
Well, I guess it'll
always be a monument

03:42.180 --> 03:44.307
to Grandma's secret
drinking problem.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.185
Okay, so maybe that thing's
a hunk of junk,

03:47.268 --> 03:48.895
but look at what
you're selling.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.731
50 bucks for a toy?
No kid is worth that.

03:51.814 --> 03:55.568
Oh, but this is the Rex Mars
Atomic Discombobulator.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.029
Don't you just love
the graphics on this box?

03:58.112 --> 03:59.989
No.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.659
How you can you love a box
or a toy or graphics?

04:02.742 --> 04:03.701
You're a grown man.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.994
It's camp.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.333
The tragically ludicrous?
The ludicrously tragic?

04:10.416 --> 04:13.169
Oh, yeah.
Like when a clown dies.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.629
Well, sort of...

04:14.712 --> 04:17.048
But I mean more like
inflatable furniture

04:17.131 --> 04:18.967
or "Last Supper" TV trays,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.593
or even this bowling shirt.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.804
Can you believe somebody
gave this to Goodwill?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.681
(murmuring sheepishly)

04:24.764 --> 04:26.140
And that kind of stuff
is worth money?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.558
Boy, howdy.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.644
Man, you should come over
to our place.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.063
It's full of valuable,
worthless crap.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.856
Well, if you're
inviting me over...

04:33.940 --> 04:36.276
I practically insist.
Shall we say 5:00?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.527
The snacking hour?

04:37.610 --> 04:40.655
My heart is palpitating.
Woo-hoo!

04:42.198 --> 04:44.325
Pimento nose and voila.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.578
Mommy's patented
happy-cracker snack platter.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.706
(doorbell rings)

04:53.876 --> 04:55.253
(doorbell rings)

04:55.336 --> 04:57.255
Ding-dong.
Classic.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.007
I mean, that says
it all, doesn't it?

04:59.090 --> 05:02.343
Oh, man, you weren't kidding
about this place.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.553
Well,
I just love it.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.971
Do I know you?

05:05.054 --> 05:08.391
Oh, the color scheme
and the rabbit ears.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.684
And the 2.3 children.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.644
I mean, where's the Hi-C?

05:11.728 --> 05:12.895
Hi-C
and fluffernutters.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.397
Oh!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.316
And pearls
on a little girl.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.318
It's a fairy tale.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.361
Oh.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.196
Oh, I've got the exact
same curtains,

05:22.280 --> 05:23.740
only in my bathroom.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.742
Didn't you just die
when you found these?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.327
Not really.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.997
They just had corn on them.
Kitchen? Corn?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.291
Oh!

05:33.374 --> 05:35.626
(giggles)

05:35.710 --> 05:36.794
(chuckles)

05:36.878 --> 05:38.963
Oww!
Why you little--

05:39.047 --> 05:43.134
Aaah! Dad! Dad!
Company! Company!

05:43.217 --> 05:45.011
Oh. I'll just be
another minute, John.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.095
Have a seat.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.263
(choking)

05:55.313 --> 05:57.565
So do those records
have camp value?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.359
Everything here does.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.361
You yourself are worth
a bundle, Homer.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.071
Why, I could wrap a bow
around you

06:03.154 --> 06:04.864
and slap on a price tag.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.366
<i>♪ I love the night life</i>
<i>I love to boogie ♪</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:09.077
Come on, Homer,
join the party.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.828
<i>♪ On the disco... ♪</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:12.663
Mom, John loves Itchy
and Scratchy

06:12.747 --> 06:15.166
as much as we do--
Maybe more.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.210
Yeah, and he collects
toy robots.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.253
He is quite a charmer.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.631
Your father's certainly
taken a shine to him.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.218
Oh, Homer,
you are the living end.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.011
(both laughing)

06:27.095 --> 06:28.346
Oh!

06:28.429 --> 06:30.640
That John is the greatest guy
in the world.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.225
We've got to have him
and his wife over

06:32.308 --> 06:33.684
for drinks sometime.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.354
Mmm, I don't think
he's married, Homer.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.440
Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh?

06:39.524 --> 06:42.485
Well, there's lots
of foxy ladies out there.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.321
Homer, didn't John
seem a little...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.198
festive to you?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.283
Couldn't agree more.
Happy as a clam.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.661
He prefers
the company of men.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.121
Who doesn't?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.665
Homer,
listen carefully--

06:55.748 --> 06:58.292
John is a ho-mo--

06:58.376 --> 06:59.377
Right.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.087
...sexual.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.338
(screams)

07:05.675 --> 07:07.218
Oh my God, Oh my God,
Oh my God,

07:07.301 --> 07:09.387
Oh, my God!
I danced with a gay.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.472
Marge, Lisa, promise me
you won't tell anyone.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.099
Promise me!

07:13.182 --> 07:14.892
You're being ridiculous.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.477
Am I, Marge? Am I?

07:16.561 --> 07:17.812
Think of the property values.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.147
Now we can never say

07:19.230 --> 07:21.315
only straight people
have been in this house.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.317
I'm very sorry
you feel that way,

07:23.401 --> 07:25.945
because John invited us
all out for a drive today,

07:26.028 --> 07:27.196
and we're going.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.240
Whoa-ho-ho. Not me.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.076
And not because John's gay,
but because he's a sneak.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.495
He should have the good taste
to mince around

07:34.579 --> 07:36.956
and let everyone know
that he's that way.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.250
What on earth are
you talking about?

07:39.333 --> 07:40.793
You know me, Marge.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.795
I like my beer cold,
my TV loud,

07:42.879 --> 07:46.466
and my homosexuals
fa-laming.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.677
(horn honking
"Over the Rainbow")

07:52.263 --> 07:54.765
Zzzapp!

07:54.849 --> 07:55.766
(gasps)

07:57.477 --> 07:59.437
Homer, at least come out
and say hello.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.813
-No. Nuh-uh. No.
-Oh, come on.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.524
-Oh, no.
-You liked John this morning.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.902
No! I am not setting
foot outside this house

08:05.985 --> 08:07.653
until that man is gone.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.572
Oh! Dad,
you are the living end.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.748
Hey, where'd that cool,
creepy Santa come from?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.541
Japan. Except over there,
they call him

08:20.625 --> 08:23.044
"Annual Gift-man"
and he lives on the moon.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.551
JOHN:
And that's where Kent Brockman

08:30.635 --> 08:32.178
was caught cheating
in the Springfield marathon.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.596
-Whoa.
-Ooh. Oh.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.556
And there's where
Lupe Velez

08:35.640 --> 08:37.391
bought the toilet
she drowned in.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.311
ALL: Oh! Oh!

08:40.394 --> 08:42.813
BART:
That was a killer tour, man.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.440
I never realized
how many celebrities

08:44.524 --> 08:47.318
humiliated themselves
right in our own backyard.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.237
This is a sordid little burg,
isn't it?

08:49.320 --> 08:52.448
Makes me sick
in a wonderful, wonderful way.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.117
-John.
-Oh... Waylon.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.786
I'd like you
to meet the Simpsons.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.371
I know the Simpsons.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.706
So this is your
sick mother?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.000
Don't do this
to me, Waylon.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.464
(laughing)

09:08.548 --> 09:09.757
How'd it go?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.259
Tell me everything
that happened.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.135
He didn't give you gay,
did he? Did he?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.179
Oh, jeez, Louise!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.973
You don't even know
what you're worried about anymore.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.600
John's a witty,
urbane person.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.269
Oh, and I'm not.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.895
Hey, Dad, look
what I got.

09:22.979 --> 09:27.358
Zzzapp. Zzzapp.
Zzzapp... Zzzapp...

09:34.240 --> 09:36.742
Bart! Where'd you
get that shirt?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.619
I don't know.
Came out of the closet.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.247
Uh... huh.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.208
I hope
you all saved room,

09:44.292 --> 09:46.085
because I made
your favorite dessert.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.088
Store-bought snack cakes--
Both kinds.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.675
Hmm, hmm.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.635
Hmm...

09:54.719 --> 09:55.886
(gasps)

09:55.970 --> 09:57.763
(Homer mumbling)

10:01.309 --> 10:03.477
Homie, I can hear you
chewing on your pillow.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.895
What's wrong?

10:04.979 --> 10:08.441
Marge, the boy was wearing
a Hawaiian shirt.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.192
So?

10:10.276 --> 10:12.069
There's only two kinds of guys
who wear those shirts:

10:12.153 --> 10:13.946
gay guys and big,
fat party animals.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.783
And Bart doesn't look like
a big, fat party animal to me.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.953
So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt
it wouldn't be gay?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.913
Right.
Thank you.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.541
I hope you realize
this is all your fault.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.628
I mean, do you have to be
so effeminate around the boy?

10:28.711 --> 10:31.130
Homer, I don't think
there's a problem with Bart

10:31.213 --> 10:33.215
but if there is,
it's probably because

10:33.299 --> 10:35.259
you're not spending
any time with him.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.636
Good night.

10:40.556 --> 10:44.602
("It's In His Kiss" playing)

10:44.685 --> 10:46.771
All right, boy, come on.
Today we're going to--

10:46.854 --> 10:48.856
-(screams)
<i>-♪ Or is it in his face? ♪</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:51.233
<i>♪ Oh, no,</i>
<i>it's just his charm ♪</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:52.943
Gonna what, Homer?

10:53.027 --> 10:53.986
<i>♪ Oh, no that's... ♪</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:55.488
(record scratches)

10:55.571 --> 10:58.240
And Helen Lovejoy,
sure, she looks blonde,

10:58.324 --> 10:59.867
but I've heard cuffs
and collar don't match,

10:59.950 --> 11:01.118
if you get my drift.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.579
I don't,
but I loved hearing it.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.289
You!

11:05.373 --> 11:06.540
I should have known.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.917
Well, good morning,
sunshine.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.211
Homer, John brought us
cactus candy.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.047
Look, John, you seem like
a perfectly nice guy and all.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.049
Just stay the hell away
from my family.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.635
Well, now you don't
get any candy.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.805
-No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece.
-No.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.599
Homer, what have you
got against gays?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.602
You know. It's...
It's not... usual.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.562
If there was a law,
it would be against it.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.232
Oh, Homer, please--
You're embarrassing yourself.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.150
No, I'm not, Marge!

11:33.234 --> 11:36.195
They're embarrassing me.
They're embarrassing America.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.572
They turned the navy
into a floating joke.

11:38.656 --> 11:42.410
They ruined all our best names,
like Bruce and Lance and Julian.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.412
Those were the toughest
names we had.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.164
Now they're just... uh...

11:47.248 --> 11:49.625
-Queer?
-Yeah, and that's another thing.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.794
I resent you people
using that word.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.630
That's our word
for making fun of you.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.674
We need it.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.761
Well, I'm taking back our word,
and I'm taking back my son.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.555
Don't worry, boy.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.556
We're going to
set you straight.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.182
By tomorrow morning,

12:05.266 --> 12:07.017
you'll be a regular
Burt Reynolds.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.353
What are you talking about,
Homer? Where are we going?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.647
Just a couple of good,
old-fashioned manly places...

12:11.731 --> 12:13.691
Father and son.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.401
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN: You're leaving</i>
<i>the arm there too long.</i>

12:15.484 --> 12:17.611
<i>You want</i>
<i>to make it worse?</i>

12:17.695 --> 12:19.655
<i>No! No! He'll know</i>
<i>you're onto him.</i>

12:19.739 --> 12:20.906
<i>Quick, shake his hand.</i>

12:20.990 --> 12:22.700
Just remember, son,

12:22.783 --> 12:26.036
whatever happens
I'll always love you.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.079
<i>As? As?</i>

12:27.163 --> 12:28.998
As a father. A father.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.166
Regular father.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.250
Whew.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.257
What am I supposed
to do here?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.009
Nothing.
Just sit. I'll be back.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.562
Well, it's been two hours.
How do you feel?

12:51.645 --> 12:54.190
I don't know.
I kind of want a cigarette.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.484
That's a good start.
Let's get you a pack.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.651
What's your brand?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.695
Anything slim.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.363
Okay, that didn't work.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.532
But I know
something that will.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.744
(machinery clanking)

13:06.827 --> 13:08.662
Bart, I want you
to shake hands with--

13:08.746 --> 13:10.122
What's your name, fellow?

13:10.206 --> 13:12.792
-Roscoe.
-Roscoe, here, runs this mill.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.126
He's going to show us around

13:14.210 --> 13:15.753
and let you get
a first-hand look

13:15.836 --> 13:18.964
at real, all-American Joes
doing what they do best.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.424
Why the hell would
I want to see that?

13:20.508 --> 13:22.384
You'll thank me
on your wedding night.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.434
Hey! Listen up!

13:30.518 --> 13:33.270
I want all of youse to say
hello to the Simpsons.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.066

13:37.149 --> 13:39.360
Has the whole world
gone insane?

13:39.443 --> 13:41.821
(lisping) Stand still.
There's a spark in your hair.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.239
Get it, get it!

13:43.322 --> 13:44.990
(whimpering)

13:45.074 --> 13:47.701
Hot stuff
coming through.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.371
Dad, why did you bring me
to a gay steel mill?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.122
I don't know.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.791
This is a nightmare!

13:53.874 --> 13:55.793
You're all sick!

13:55.876 --> 13:57.711
Oh, be nice.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.422
Oh... My son doesn't stand
a chance.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.757
The whole world's gone gay!

14:01.841 --> 14:03.133
(factory whistle)

14:03.217 --> 14:05.344
Oh, my God,
what's happening now?

14:05.427 --> 14:07.721
We work hard,
we play hard.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.849
(dance music playing)

14:09.932 --> 14:12.142
<i>♪ Everybody dance now ♪</i>

14:18.774 --> 14:20.276
<i>♪ Everybody dance now! ♪</i>

14:23.612 --> 14:27.032
And the entire steel mill
was gay.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.534
Where you been,
Homer?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.578
Entire
steel industry's gay.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.163
Aerospace, too,
and the railroads.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.624
And you know what else?
Broadway.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.835
I always thought
Bart would grow up

14:37.918 --> 14:39.503
to be just like us.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.629
What happened?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.590
Oh, it ain't
no mystery.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.385
Whole modern world's got
a swishifying effect on kids today,

14:46.468 --> 14:48.470
and their MTVs
and their diet sodas

14:48.554 --> 14:50.431
ain't going to set them
straight neither.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.392
You got to do it yourself,
Homer and you gotta do it fast.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.603
What would turn Bart
into a man fast?

14:55.686 --> 14:56.770
You have to think for me.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.522
Well,
let's see now...

14:58.606 --> 15:00.733
Time was, you'd send
a boy off to war.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.401
Shooting a man
would fix him right up,

15:02.484 --> 15:04.111
but there's not even
any wars no more

15:04.194 --> 15:06.530
thank you very much,
Warren Christopher.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.491
Better yet,
Bart could shoot a deer.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.702
That's like shooting
a beautiful man.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.828
Hey, he's right,
Homer.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.747
After the boy
bags a deer,

15:14.830 --> 15:16.999
all the diet sodas in the world
won't turn him back.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.542
Then you just
sit back

15:18.626 --> 15:20.502
and watch the grandkids
roll in.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.296
Hunting, eh?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.469
(laughter)

15:31.055 --> 15:32.306
(growling)

15:33.432 --> 15:34.600
Stand aside, Marge.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.477
I'm taking the boy
deer hunting.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.729
He's going to grow up
straight for once.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.606
What?
You never went hunting before,

15:40.689 --> 15:42.608
and you're
perfectly straight.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.944
Oh, yeah? How long
since you've had a baby?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.904
But, Dad,
it's barbaric.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.239
How does killing a deer
make you more of a man?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.158
It just does.
Name me one gay Indian.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.118
Uh-oh. Something's
going to die.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.411
Butt out, buttinsky.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.330
What would you know
about hunting?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.040
I know this much.
I wouldn't wear that hideous hat.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.500
Here. Take this one.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.543
It was worn
by Yale Summers in "Daktari."

16:01.627 --> 16:03.545
Hang on to it, toy-boy
you might need it

16:03.629 --> 16:06.090
when it starts
raining naked ladies.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.471
Today you're going
to be a man, Bart.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.390
You guys going
to teach me to drive?

16:14.473 --> 16:17.434
Oh, yeah. Let a twinkle-toes
drive Betsy. Right.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.435
(nervous laughing)

16:18.519 --> 16:19.687
No, boy.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.563
You can't drive.
You're only ten.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.732
You're going hunting.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.068
You ever been hunting
before, there, Barty?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.736
Nope. Something
about a bunch of guys

16:27.820 --> 16:30.280
alone together
in the woods...

16:30.364 --> 16:31.323
Seems kind of gay.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.869
That is a very immature
attitude, young man.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.874
Remember, guys, the truck
only holds six carcasses,

16:40.958 --> 16:43.043
so don't shoot nothing
but trophy bucks, huh?

16:54.638 --> 16:56.640
Aw, we should have
just stayed at the bar

16:56.724 --> 16:58.600
and shot some rats.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.103
Hey, those ain't
your rats, Barn.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.938
Well, Homie, you ready
to call it quits?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.898
Oh, but... Wait a minute.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.151
Bart's not fixed yet.
He hasn't even...

17:07.234 --> 17:09.069
Homer...

17:09.153 --> 17:10.571
Ohh...

17:15.743 --> 17:17.870
Come on, don't take
it so hard, Homer.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.455
You still got
that other kid--

17:19.538 --> 17:21.540
Uh... Lisa.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.042
Let's, uh, take her out
hunting tomorrow,

17:23.125 --> 17:24.668
make her into a man.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.919
Aw, she'd never go.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.838
She's a vegetarian.

17:27.921 --> 17:31.925
Oh, jeez! Homer, jeez!

17:32.009 --> 17:34.053
You and Marge ain't
cousins, are you?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.473
No. This whole thing
is my fault.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.850
I've been a lousy Dad.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.771
(gasps)

17:43.854 --> 17:45.105
Cheer up, Homer.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.523
Christmas is coming
early this year.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.577
JOHN: Did he say
where were they going?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.871
No. They were just going
to find a deer

18:00.954 --> 18:02.581
and make Bart
shoot it.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.625
Deer? Ha!
Not around here.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.126
They all migrated north

18:06.210 --> 18:08.128
when the state park
converted to astroturf.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.671
But if there's
no deer out there

18:09.755 --> 18:11.381
then what are they hunting?

18:11.465 --> 18:14.051
The only thing around here
that's even close to deer is...

18:23.811 --> 18:24.728
Hey, boy, wake up.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.605
Your old man
found some deer.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.524
Huh? You did?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.487
Wait, man,
those are reindeer.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.615
-(gun cocks)
-Yeah. And it's your shot, son.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.535
What? I'm not going to shoot
a reindeer in a pen.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.703
Come on, Bart.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.705
Be a sport
and kill Blitzen, okay?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.124
Dad!

18:45.207 --> 18:48.085
Aw, criminy,
here come the waterworks.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.711
Bart, I'm going
to turn my back,

18:49.795 --> 18:51.421
and when I turn around,
I want to see

18:51.505 --> 18:54.133
a whole pile
of dead reindeer!

18:57.302 --> 18:58.220
(loud bang)

18:58.303 --> 18:59.972
That a way, son!

19:00.055 --> 19:02.141
You made your old man proud.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.475
I didn't do anything.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.601
(bang)

19:04.685 --> 19:06.145
Hey, they're going nuts

19:06.228 --> 19:08.105
like in those nature films!

19:08.188 --> 19:09.606
Ah, must be mating season.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.611
(all screaming)

19:18.824 --> 19:20.701
Dad, I'm scared.

19:20.784 --> 19:21.952
Me, too, son.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.748
No, don't.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.208
You have to protect
yourself!

19:28.292 --> 19:31.545
Son, there comes a time
in every father's life

19:31.628 --> 19:32.546
when he must...

19:32.629 --> 19:34.339
(grunting)

19:36.091 --> 19:37.759
Dad, are you hurt?

19:37.843 --> 19:41.388
Just my bones and organs.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.516
-(snorts)

19:55.736 --> 19:57.738
What the--

19:57.821 --> 19:59.406
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

19:59.489 --> 20:02.743
Bart, look!
It's Santa Claus!

20:06.455 --> 20:08.165
Whoa! It's Santa,
all right,

20:08.248 --> 20:09.791
and he is kicking ass!

20:09.875 --> 20:13.629
MECHANICAL VOICE:
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.797
It's a miracle!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.424
JOHN: No-- Ultrasuede
is a miracle.

20:17.507 --> 20:18.550
This is just good timing.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.803
(groaning)

20:21.887 --> 20:24.890
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad
you're safe.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.851
Hmm, you feel softer
than before.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.561
I've been tenderized.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.021
How'd you know
that thing would work?

20:31.104 --> 20:33.106
Well, the sound
is just brutal,

20:33.190 --> 20:34.900
and I figured reindeer
would naturally be afraid

20:34.983 --> 20:37.152
of their cruel master,
Santa Claus.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.488
I mean,
wouldn't you be? Ha!

20:39.571 --> 20:43.659
Is it okay to come out now,
Mr. Gay Man, sir?

20:43.742 --> 20:46.662
I'll do anything
you say. Anything.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.917
Aw, Moe, we were saved
by a sissy.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.211
Yeah, yeah.
We'll never live it down.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.631
Oh, boy, it looks like
it's suicide again for me.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.383
Hey! We owe this guy,

20:59.466 --> 21:02.511
and I don't want you
calling him a sissy.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.930
This guy's a fruit,

21:05.013 --> 21:07.474
and a...
No, wait, wait, wait.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.101
Queer, queer, queer.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.686
That's what you like
to be called, right?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.562
Well, that or John.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.231
This is about
as tolerant as Dad gets,

21:14.314 --> 21:15.607
so you should be flattered.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.817
Great!

21:16.900 --> 21:18.735
Well, Homer,
I won your respect

21:18.819 --> 21:20.946
and all I had to do
was save your life.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.532
Now, if every gay man
could just do the same,

21:23.615 --> 21:24.783
you'd be set.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.034
Amen to that.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.581
You know, Bart,

21:31.665 --> 21:33.792
maybe it's just
the concussion talking,

21:33.875 --> 21:36.336
but any way you choose
to live your life

21:36.420 --> 21:38.088
is okay with me.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.506
Huh?

21:39.589 --> 21:41.466
(whispering)
He thinks you're gay.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.135
He thinks I'm gay?
