WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:04.834
Chew carefully, I'm missing an earring.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.083
Eh, I'll roll the dice.

00:11.875 --> 00:12.750
Hey, everybody.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.041
I have some big news..

00:15.667 --> 00:16.709
I'm moving out.

00:16.792 --> 00:17.917
You're what?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.417
What do you mean you're moving out?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.959
I am moving in with Emmett.

00:21.041 --> 00:23.291
His parents promised him an apartment
when he turned 18.

00:23.542 --> 00:26.500
They had a party for him, gave him a cake
and drove him to the new place.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.667
All in like 20 minutes.

00:31.083 --> 00:32.709
PJ, I, I'm not sure about this.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.083
Mom, it totally makes sense.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.166
I'm about to start Community College
and the apartment is right near campus.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.542
That is a good point.

00:38.792 --> 00:39.959
Blah, blah, blah.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.625
All I'm hearing
is that I'm getting my own room.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.125
Let's get you packed. Well, come on.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.667
Bob, are you sure PJ's
ready to live on his own?

00:53.792 --> 00:56.166
Well, he is 18, honey.

00:58.375 --> 01:02.834
Oh, it sounds like somebody's experiencing
empty-nest syndrome.

01:04.583 --> 01:09.000
Well, the good news there
is that our nest is still very, very full.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.250
In fact, the challenge is to avoid
having any more little birdies.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.291
It just went by so fast.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.542
You know, it seems like just yesterday

01:19.625 --> 01:21.625
that PJ was tripping over his shoelaces

01:21.709 --> 01:23.583
and we were wiping his nose.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.166
It was yesterday.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.583
Hello, Teddy. Spence, you ready?

02:34.667 --> 02:36.834
I left my coat downstairs.
I'll be right back.

02:37.542 --> 02:38.500
Would you like to come in?

02:38.583 --> 02:40.917
Oh no, that's okay. I'm fine, thanks.

02:45.291 --> 02:48.083
So it's, uh... It's been awhile.
How have you been?

02:48.166 --> 02:50.041
I'm good. Thank you.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.166
- And you?
- Good. Good.

03:01.417 --> 03:04.959
So how about that weather?

03:07.417 --> 03:10.750
It's like it's not too hot, not too cold.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.625
- Temperate, you might say.
- Yes.

03:15.709 --> 03:16.750
Temperate.

03:17.709 --> 03:18.709
Temperate.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.458
Oh, Spencer's back. Yay!

03:22.542 --> 03:24.542
Hey, it wasn't there.
I must have left it in the backyard.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.208
- I'll just...
- No! No!

03:26.291 --> 03:27.917
You can get it next time. Out you go.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.375
Okay.

03:29.583 --> 03:32.000
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.625
Temperate? What?

03:44.458 --> 03:47.250
Bob, would you take Toby upstairs
and put him down for his nap?

03:47.542 --> 03:50.917
Uh, up, up, upstairs? That's uh...

03:51.667 --> 03:53.417
It's kinda lonely up there, isn't it?

03:55.166 --> 03:57.375
Would you take Toby upstairs
and put him down for his nap?

03:59.083 --> 04:01.417
Hey, you know what?
Have him nap right here.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.041
Bob, he's six weeks old.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.166
Never too early to learn how to couch-nap.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.375
Okay, fine. I will take him upstairs.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.458
And you better get real comfortable
on that couch.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.500
- What was that about?
- What?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.417
Not wanting to take the baby upstairs.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.250
I mean, that's lazy...

04:25.625 --> 04:26.875
Even for you.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.959
What? I just didn't feel like it.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.333
That's all.

04:31.834 --> 04:34.000
No, there's something going on with you.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.625
Since when did you become
so interested in me?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.291
Since the cable went out.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.375
Man, this place is great.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.417
We should really call your dad
and thank him.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.417
We can't. Part of the agreement
about the new apartment

04:50.500 --> 04:51.709
is that I never call.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.375
This is so awesome.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.792
- We can eat whatever we want.
- Stay up past our bedtime.

04:57.875 --> 05:01.166
- Dude, there is no bedtime!
- Yay, we're adults now!

05:01.250 --> 05:02.333
Yeah!

05:03.333 --> 05:05.625
- Dude, I'm gonna go check out the view.
- Okay.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.250
Hey, look at this clown.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.333
Oh, it's an actual clown.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.125
You're not still afraid
of clowns, are you?

05:19.208 --> 05:20.125
No.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.125
You know what the best part

05:23.208 --> 05:24.250
- about this place is?
- Huh?

05:24.333 --> 05:25.875
Our moms aren't around
to tell us what to do.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.291
Ah.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.000
It's your Mom.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.083
Hi, guys! Brought you some lunch.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.667
Lunch! Awesome.

05:39.375 --> 05:40.750
Except for we don't have any plates.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.375
Or forks.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.709
Hey, why don't you go see
if that clown next door has any?

05:46.083 --> 05:46.959
I'm on it.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.500
Sweetheart, that's not nice.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.250
We don't call our neighbors clowns.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.458
Well, if I knew his professional name,
I'd use it.

05:55.792 --> 05:58.458
So what do you think of the place?

05:58.542 --> 06:00.375
- It's nice!
- Yeah.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.959
Yeah, it's a little small maybe.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.291
Call it cozy.

06:04.375 --> 06:05.583
Kinda drafty.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.250
We call it inside breezy.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.041
That's Emmett's bed and that's mine.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.625
Oh, Emmett's a little messy, isn't he?

06:12.709 --> 06:14.917
Yeah. Well, that's Emmett.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.667
Oh, honey,
just because it's Emmett's apartment

06:17.750 --> 06:19.625
doesn't mean you should let
him walk all over you.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.125
If you don't like the mess, say something.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.333
Mom, stop worrying, okay?
It's gonna be fine.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.917
We're grown-ups now...

06:33.166 --> 06:34.917
It was just so awkward

06:35.000 --> 06:36.667
and I kept saying temperate.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.917
And I never say temperate.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.709
You just said it twice.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.542
Does your mom like me?

06:46.875 --> 06:48.834
Hey, of course she likes you.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.166
I mean, does your mom like me?

06:51.542 --> 06:52.792
Let's keep it on your mom.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.375
Hey Teddy, look, my mom
likes you, all right?

06:56.458 --> 06:59.208
That's just how she is.
You know, she's reserved.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.709
Well, I want us to have
a good relationship.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.125
So tell me some stuff about her.

07:04.208 --> 07:05.875
Okay, um, what do you wanna know?

07:06.875 --> 07:09.792
I wanna know who is Lynn Walsh?

07:09.875 --> 07:12.000
What's her favorite color,
her favorite food?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.166
Who would play her in
the movie of her life?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.959
Do you know that stuff about your Mom?

07:18.041 --> 07:20.709
Purple, lasagna and Reese Witherspoon.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.542
Oh, um...

07:24.625 --> 07:26.375
All right, well, there's
one thing I can tell you..

07:26.458 --> 07:27.834
She likes orchids.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.291
- Orchids.
- Yeah.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.917
Good, okay. So what else?

07:31.542 --> 07:35.917
Uh, oh, she likes going to this
one fancy place downtown for high tea.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.291
Great. Okay, keep going.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.667
That's all I got.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.375
That's it?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.458
Hey look, I think it's pretty great
I came up with that.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.959
Okay, I just had an awesome idea.

07:50.375 --> 07:54.709
I'm gonna take your mom out to tea
and we're gonna talk about orchids..

07:55.583 --> 07:57.625
And tea.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.000
That's great.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.125
I don't have to come to this, do I?

08:12.166 --> 08:14.458
I just need you to watch
the baby for a sec...

08:14.542 --> 08:15.959
Whoa!..

08:18.000 --> 08:19.792
No!

08:23.125 --> 08:25.041
No!

08:25.250 --> 08:26.667
Oh ow!

08:26.750 --> 08:28.625
Mmm.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.041
Nobody tells Mom!

08:39.875 --> 08:41.583
- What are we not telling Mom?
- What?

08:42.166 --> 08:43.000
What?

08:43.083 --> 08:45.625
Dude, you just yelled
"nobody tells Mom" in your sleep.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.166
I mean I'm in, I just wanna know
what we're not telling her.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.166
Bob: No.

08:50.709 --> 08:54.083
No, I was just dreaming about
that time I dropped Charlie.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.375
Oh.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.667
I remember that day.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.834
That was a really good sandwich.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.375
Now I'm worried
I'm gonna do the same thing to Toby.

09:05.458 --> 09:06.750
I can't stop thinking about it.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.375
So that's why you didn't wanna carry him
up the stairs.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.709
I don't wanna carry him
down the stairs either.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.834
- What are you gonna do, Dad?
- I don't know!

09:15.083 --> 09:17.333
But I can't drop Toby like I did Charlie.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.542
- You did what?
- I did wh... Hey!

09:19.625 --> 09:21.834
Hey, hey, sweetie.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.959
No, no, no, Daddy didn't drop you.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.875
It was more... It... It...
It was more like a toss.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.834
And then you flew a little!

09:29.959 --> 09:31.125
Bad Daddy.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.417
But Daddy caught you.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.667
Lucky Daddy.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.875
Thanks for buying
plates and forks, Emmett.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.375
Too bad we're having soup.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.417
Hey, would you mind picking that up?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.834
I will, just let me finish
my plate of soup first.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.250
- It'll take one second.
- I don't have a second.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.709
Soup gets cold really fast
when it's on a plate.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.917
How long does it take
to pick up a piece of trash?

10:04.375 --> 10:06.375
Okay, well, wait. What's your problem?

10:06.709 --> 10:08.625
My problem is my roommate is a slob.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.333
- I'm a slob?
- You're a slob.

10:10.417 --> 10:12.125
- You take that back!
- I will not.

10:12.542 --> 10:14.875
You know, I hate when you get like this.
I'm going to my room.

10:15.625 --> 10:16.959
All right, well, I'm going to my room.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.458
- You better not be looking at me.
- You better not be looking at me.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.458
- Stop it!
- You stop it!

10:27.542 --> 10:29.375
- No, you stop it! Turn around.
- You... Okay.

10:29.458 --> 10:30.500
You want something to look at?

10:31.333 --> 10:32.250
Try this.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.125
Ha! See, that doesn't bother me.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.542
- Now you're the clown.
- No, you're the clown.

10:37.625 --> 10:38.875
- You're the clown.
- You're the clown.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.125
You don't think you're a clown?

10:40.208 --> 10:41.166
- Want me to prove that you're a clown?
- Fine!

10:41.250 --> 10:42.250
Look at your bed!

10:47.583 --> 10:49.583
Yes hi, um...

10:49.667 --> 10:52.667
I'm just double-checking
a reservation for Duncan?

10:53.583 --> 10:56.458
Yes. Yes, I...
I know I called five minutes ago.

10:56.542 --> 10:57.583
It's just...

10:58.333 --> 11:01.000
It's a...
It's a very important reservation.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.333
See, it's with my boyfriend's Mom...

11:06.208 --> 11:07.917
Yes, the one who likes orchids.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.792
Oh, okay...

11:10.875 --> 11:12.208
Um, she's here.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.667
Okay, I have to go. I'll...

11:13.750 --> 11:15.000
I'll call you from the car.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.000
- Hello!
- Hello.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.000
- Come in, sit.
- Oh, love to.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.834
You look lovely.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.458
So do you.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.166
- Shall we?
- Sure.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.792
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, PJ what are you doing here?

11:58.875 --> 12:00.583
Oh, Emmett and I had a big fight.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.458
Really?

12:02.792 --> 12:04.250
That's terrible.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.750
Oh, you know what?

12:06.834 --> 12:09.458
Gabe put a lock on your bedroom door
but I'll get the bolt cutters.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.709
No, Mom, Mom, no!
Mom, I'm not moving back.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.917
We worked it out.

12:14.792 --> 12:15.959
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.208
I got mad because he was
messing up the place.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.709
He got mad because I got mad.
Then we got tired of being mad.

12:20.792 --> 12:23.792
He agreed to stop being a slob
and we made chocolate toast.

12:25.625 --> 12:28.750
Oh. Well, good for you,
standing up for yourself.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
- Mmm.
- And I'm sure Emmett

12:30.750 --> 12:33.750
will live up to his promise
of not being a slob.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.375
I mean you know what they say.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.667
"People change".

12:38.834 --> 12:41.375
Or is it that people never change?

12:47.208 --> 12:48.583
Doing great, big guy.

12:48.875 --> 12:50.875
I don't know if I can do this.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.625
- Just keep coming.
- No.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.125
My, my knees are wobbling.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.125
Yes!

12:59.500 --> 13:01.959
Okay, all right.

13:02.041 --> 13:05.375
So you made it down with a roast,
a ham and a chicken.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.542
You wanna try some side dishes?

13:09.375 --> 13:10.917
I'm ready to carry a real kid.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.250
What are you looking at?

13:23.083 --> 13:25.333
- Hi.
- Hi!

13:25.417 --> 13:26.583
Hi.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.125
Okay uh, two questions.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.792
Why are you carrying Gabe and...

13:33.166 --> 13:35.458
why does that chicken have a face?

13:36.250 --> 13:38.375
Oh, uh... Oh. You know why?

13:38.458 --> 13:39.834
We're playing a new game.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.291
We're playing a new game called uh...

13:42.375 --> 13:43.291
Chicken drop.

13:43.709 --> 13:48.542
And, uh, he who drops the chicken
must carry the victor down the stairs.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.625
We're still working out the kinks.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.417
- May I help you?
- Hi.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.500
We have a reservation.
Duncan, party of two.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.250
Sorry, I don't have you down.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.542
What? But, um...

14:15.792 --> 14:19.125
I confirmed the reservation
and then I reconfirmed.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.500
And then I reconfirmed the reconfirm.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.792
Which is... Which is basically
just a long way of saying

14:23.875 --> 14:25.792
that I put a lot of work
into this reservation

14:25.917 --> 14:28.667
so I want my table and I want it now!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.709
Oh, here it is, "Duncan".

14:35.750 --> 14:36.792
Shall we?

14:45.083 --> 14:46.458
So who are you again?

14:46.542 --> 14:47.875
I'm the Window Inspector

14:47.959 --> 14:50.250
from the Department
of See-through Services.

14:51.417 --> 14:54.333
Okay, I've been
a building manager for 25 years,

14:54.417 --> 14:56.250
and I have never heard of that.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.166
Well, you're hearing about it now.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.208
Amy: All right,
let's see what we got here.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.834
Yeah.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.291
P87, single pane. We see a lot of these.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.500
Okay, for the final part of my inspection,

15:12.583 --> 15:14.417
I'm gonna need you to vacate the premises.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
I can't do that.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.375
I take the security of my building
very seriously.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.083
- I have a candy bar.
- Lock up when you're done.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.208
PJ!

16:02.125 --> 16:03.500
Unbelievable!

16:04.041 --> 16:05.250
He promised.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.542
Oh!

16:14.792 --> 16:19.458
Oh, so "the clown next door"
meant the clown next door.

16:29.875 --> 16:30.917
So how's your tea?

16:31.500 --> 16:32.917
Actually...

16:33.166 --> 16:34.417
...it's a little cold.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.500
Well, I can fix that.

16:37.166 --> 16:39.667
Um, excuse me, her tea is cold.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.750
Could you get her a fresh cup?

16:41.834 --> 16:45.500
And make sure it's hot, like piping hot.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.959
I hear that you like orchids.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.125
I used to and then my Mother passed away.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.125
Orchids were her favorite too.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.875
And now I can't even look
at one without crying.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.458
Oh my gosh.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.083
Are you okay?

17:03.709 --> 17:07.208
Yes. Oh, my hand fell asleep.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.667
Darn it.

17:13.750 --> 17:14.750
Thank you.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.458
What, what's wrong?

17:20.542 --> 17:22.333
Oh, I burned my tongue.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.917
Ice, ice! We need ice!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Ice!

17:31.166 --> 17:32.417
Is that helping?

17:32.792 --> 17:34.041
I'm stuck.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.208
You're what?

17:36.542 --> 17:38.417
I'm stuck!

17:40.625 --> 17:42.041
You're a duck? Could you...

17:42.250 --> 17:43.917
Could you sound it out?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.000
How is everything over here?

17:57.959 --> 17:59.583
Well, Mom, I'm moving back home.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.709
Oh, no.

18:01.792 --> 18:05.250
It's such sad, unexpected news.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.208
I came back home today
and the place was a mess.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.500
What was it?

18:10.834 --> 18:13.625
Unmade bed? Potato chips everywhere?

18:13.792 --> 18:15.208
How do you know about the chips?

18:15.917 --> 18:17.041
I don't.

18:18.709 --> 18:19.959
Man.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.333
And after he promised me
he's gonna keep the place clean.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.250
I'm never talking to that guy again.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.375
Hey, you know, once you get over this,
you guys will be best friends again.

18:27.458 --> 18:28.417
I don't think so.

18:28.917 --> 18:31.917
Well, really I could have dealt
with the mess...

18:32.667 --> 18:35.709
but he looked me right in the eye
and said he didn't do it.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.792
Best friends don't lie to each other.

18:41.583 --> 18:42.709
I'm gonna go put my stuff away.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.875
PJ, wait.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.417
Emmett didn't mess up your apartment.

18:53.792 --> 18:54.834
I did.

18:55.792 --> 18:56.750
What?

18:57.583 --> 18:59.041
Why would you do that?

18:59.875 --> 19:01.166
Because...

19:01.417 --> 19:05.125
I thought you weren't ready
to live on your own. And..

19:05.959 --> 19:07.208
The truth is..

19:07.792 --> 19:09.875
I'm the one who's not ready.

19:09.959 --> 19:12.208
But, Mom, I'm 18.

19:12.667 --> 19:14.417
- Amy: Yeah...
- I'm an adult now.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.709
But you're still my little boy.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.583
You'll always be my little boy.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.125
You're a good mom.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.083
I know.

19:31.166 --> 19:34.333
A good mom who broke
into my apartment and trashed it.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.083
- I know.
- Mmm.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.041
How you feeling, Dad?

19:45.375 --> 19:47.041
Good. Good.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.709
- Yeah!
- Yes, I did it!

19:53.792 --> 19:56.125
- I did it!
- Nice! What were you so worried about?

19:56.208 --> 19:58.125
I don't know. It was a piece of cake.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.792
- Where are you going?
- To get a piece of cake.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.125
A guy's gotta celebrate.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.208
Oh hey, thank you..

20:05.291 --> 20:07.750
So much for getting me through this.

20:07.834 --> 20:08.875
You...

20:09.500 --> 20:10.625
Whoa!

20:12.583 --> 20:16.250
No!

20:17.250 --> 20:19.667
No!

20:37.208 --> 20:38.542
Hey, honey.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.625
You dropped the baby again,

20:40.709 --> 20:41.834
didn't you, Bob?

20:43.166 --> 20:44.166
What?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.959
Well, Charlie, um, I went to tea
with Spencer's Mom.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.250
And we had so much fun.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.375
We decided to keep that party going

20:58.458 --> 21:01.083
in the emergency room.

21:02.792 --> 21:06.750
Yeah, I don't think Mrs. Walsh
will be talking to me anytime soon.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.959
Or to anyone.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.750
What...

21:12.083 --> 21:13.583
Dad, what are you doing?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.166
Taking Toby for a walk.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.875
Teddy: That doesn't really
look like a walk.

21:20.709 --> 21:22.208
No, it will be eventually.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.834
Teddy: Well, don't you need
the diaper bag?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.083
Aw, man!

21:35.542 --> 21:39.166
Well, you survived him for three years,
all you need is 15 more.

21:39.542 --> 21:40.709
Good luck, Charlie.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.166
Hi, Bob Duncan here
with another amazing product

21:47.250 --> 21:49.625
that is going to make your life easier.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.458
You have stairs, do you have a baby?

21:52.542 --> 21:55.834
Well, how many times
has this happened to you?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.667
Whoa!

21:59.041 --> 22:01.083
Well, those days are gone.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.458
Because the next time
your baby goes flying,

22:03.542 --> 22:06.959
he won't end up crying,
thanks to the new ultra-cute...
