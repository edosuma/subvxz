I was wrong about the
RPG, we all know that.

01:15:07.074 --> 01:15:10.211

the red flag as soon as we got

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:12.747

01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:20.254

right about is that we need to

01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:23.057

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:27.194

this up to chance...

01:15:27.228 --> 01:15:30.097
or choice.

01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:35.202
Now, we can wait here 'til
after 0600 to see if the convoy

01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:37.938
comes...

01:15:37.972 --> 01:15:41.609

01:15:41.642 --> 01:15:46.881

motherfuckers out there...

01:15:46.914 --> 01:15:48.749

01:15:48.783 --> 01:15:51.619

take them to realize that they

01:15:51.652 --> 01:15:53.254

01:15:55.289 --> 01:16:00.294

come at 0600 tomorrow...

01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:04.298

01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:20.614
If we can make it there, we
can pick them off as they come.

01:16:20.648 --> 01:16:23.250
They'll move here and they'll
use the Humvee for cover.

01:16:23.284 --> 01:16:26.387
That means we need to either
bring or destroy anything they

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.388

least one good shooter;

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:41.302

punctured my leg and...

01:17:47.034 --> 01:17:48.836

01:17:48.869 --> 01:17:52.406

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:58.412
take it out abruptly or
at the wrong angle...

01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:03.117
it will tear the artery and
I'll bleed out fairly quickly.

01:18:08.889 --> 01:18:10.090
Can we do something to help?

01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:12.493

not a good idea, Doc?

What we could do is, uh,
file that corner down.

it out a little more slowly.
