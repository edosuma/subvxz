WEBVTT

00:08.758 --> 00:10.969
I started going out
on commercial auditions.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.555
I got real close to one last week
for Fruit by the Foot.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.349
But it's like they could tell
I hated Fruit by the Foot.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.310
-I hate it. It's too much fruit.
-I know.

00:19.811 --> 00:22.480
Very few foods are improved
by becoming flatter.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.650
-Hmm.
-I feel strongly about that.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.196
Oh, my God.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.955
I don't know. It seems like
some sort of gift of some kind.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.165
I don't know, maybe...

00:40.999 --> 00:42.083
-Maybe you should check it.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.210
Who What is this?

00:46.588 --> 00:49.799
<i>First Month, Last Month?</i>
Written by Gus Cruikshank?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.385
Yeah, it's a script I wrote.

00:52.469 --> 00:58.099
I actually rewrote one of the parts for,
who was it

00:58.183 --> 01:00.101
I got a role in this?
-Yes.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.686
Kevin is Roman.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.065
Wait. Oh, shit.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.858
Oh, wait. There's mad Roman in here.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.110
Oh, all kinds of Roman,
all over the place.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.363
It's a good part too, man.
It's really, really good.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.241
Roman is this recently divorced journalist

01:15.325 --> 01:18.078
who moves into an apartment complex,
kinda like this.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.081
And then he finds out that
the landlady is this black widow-type

01:21.164 --> 01:24.459
who gets off on watching
her male tenants get murdered, right?

01:25.043 --> 01:30.298
But Roman, he's different,
'cause he's got nothing to lose, you know?

01:30.381 --> 01:31.216
Wow.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.427
Oh, I'm so freaking psyched, man.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.305
Gus here's giving me
my first real stunt job.

01:37.388 --> 01:40.475
Ah, whatever. It's all you, man.
You're gonna kill it.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.978
It's called a,
uh... a mid-level jump fall.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.647
It's easy.
I've practiced that shit already.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.357
You're gonna kill it, man.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.403
Hey, Joe, Gloria, you guys are witnessing
cinematic history over here.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.448
He's the new Hitchcock, and I'm <i>The Birds.</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:57.909
And he's the, uh, <i>Rear Window.</i>

02:07.377 --> 02:10.547
Hey, guys.
-Hey!

02:10.630 --> 02:12.006
Say hi, buddy.

02:13.883 --> 02:14.717
Hey.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.220
Shaun

02:17.303 --> 02:18.847
Oh, me and Shaun are mommy friends.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.432
God, that sounds awful. "Mommy friends."

02:21.516 --> 02:23.852
We are two adult women
who are raising children.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.563
You didn't think
to come over and say hi?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.357
When you once walked three miles
in a snowstorm to buy cocaine.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.275
You can't walk two feet?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.235
I mean, we just came by for a playdate.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.987
I don't want to bore you
with kid stuff.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.698
You kidding me

02:37.824 --> 02:38.658
Yes.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.035
Oh, Harrison.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.956
You're getting so big.
Do you still have those enormous balls?

02:45.623 --> 02:46.916
Why would you ask him that?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.459
What? 'Cause when he was first born,

02:48.543 --> 02:50.628
you used to text me pictures
of his enormous balls.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.046
That's why I'd ask that.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.214
Otis has really tiny balls.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.466
When he was a baby,
Jeff had to squeeze up in there

02:55.550 --> 02:58.011
and make sure they hadn't
sucked back up into his abdomen.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.013
-It happens.
-Cool.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.683
So, what's going on?
We should hang out, right?

03:03.766 --> 03:06.477
It's been too long,
I could come over on Friday, maybe,

03:06.561 --> 03:09.814
and Brian could grill some stuff,
and we could pretend to help.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.443
No, I don't know. I've got this
dumb thing I can't get out of.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.237
Shaun, come on,

03:16.321 --> 03:19.824
we invented this "dumb thing
I can't get out of." What's up?

03:21.409 --> 03:24.037
Fine. Brian doesn't want you
to come over anymore.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.788
What

03:26.414 --> 03:29.584
Mickey, the last time you came
to our house, you got in a fight.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.627
Oh, thank you.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.795
And you jumped off our roof into the pool.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.048
You did ruin my dinner party one time.
I'm not even here.

03:35.131 --> 03:39.510
It's so true. So true, and I'm very sorry.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.972
The bottom line is, is that
I have a baby now and a nice house,

03:43.056 --> 03:45.808
and Brian says your drama is too draining.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.729
Listen, I tried to talk to him,
and he just won't listen,

03:49.812 --> 03:51.397
so he's not gonna let you come over.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.858
He's not gonna let me come to the house?
Do you hear yourself?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.360
I thought you were a strong woman,

03:55.443 --> 03:58.238
and now some man is gonna tell you
who can and cannot come to your own house?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.114
Give me a break.
Don't get all political here.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.993
It's not like you're fighting Sharia law.
It's not just me. I'm part of a family.

04:04.577 --> 04:09.457
Brian says our house is a sacred space,
and you know what? He's right.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.377
Okay. Then why don't you and Brian
come over to my house?

04:12.460 --> 04:16.256
That way I won't taint your sacred space
with my toxicity.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.423
I don't know.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.717
Are we still friends? -Yeah, yes. Yes.
-Okay.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.765
If it's Brian who's getting in the way
of you and me hanging out,

04:25.848 --> 04:27.517
let me try and fix this.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.936
Just give me a chance.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.272
I'm-- I'm in recovery,

04:32.355 --> 04:34.941
so you have to give me the benefit
of the doubt.

04:36.943 --> 04:41.072
Yep. All right, all right. All right.
But it has to begin on the early side.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.408
We have to eat at 5:30
'cause of Harrison's schedule.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.494
That's fine. I don't care.
I'll do whatever. I'll even cook.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.288
-Yes! I'm gonna cook.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.456
I will cook Brian's favorite dish.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.208
-Uh...

04:52.292 --> 04:55.795
He had a Jewish grandmother,
so he loves a good brisket.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.756
That sounds so hard.
Could I do a Lunchables spread?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.092
-Ugh. Mickey, come on--
-I was kidding.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.969
-Come on. All right.
-I was kidding.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.323
Hey. How we feeling, buddy?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.241
-This is gonna be great.

05:25.325 --> 05:29.203
We've got permits on lock.
We're gonna be on time, under budget.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.080
-Nothing to worry about.
-Beautiful.

05:31.622 --> 05:35.585
'Cause, uh, I'm a little nervous.
I've put $5,000 in this thing.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.837
-You have...
-It's most of my savings, so...

05:37.920 --> 05:39.213
-...nothing to worry about.
-Okay.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.507
I just finished working
on my cousin's short film.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.676
-Almost got into Slamdance.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.802
-Yeah.
-Wow.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.388
Gus, can I talk to you
about these new sides real quick?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.556
Yeah, what's up?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.933
Uh, in this pool scene,
you want me to show my ass?

05:51.684 --> 05:55.104
Yeah, I guess what I was
thinking is this scene's, sort of, uh,

05:55.188 --> 05:58.483
how Roman's becoming more vulnerable
in front of the landlady,

05:58.566 --> 06:02.153
so I thought, "Oh, he's emotionally
naked, he's physically naked."

06:02.236 --> 06:04.322
Plus, a lot of times
in these erotic thrillers,

06:04.405 --> 06:07.575
they're showing off ladies' bodies,
and I'm trying to flip that on its head.

06:07.658 --> 06:08.910
It's not happening, man.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.244
I'm a professional, Gus.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.705
I'll bare my soul for you,
but I'm not gonna bare my ass.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.832
I'm trying to be Tom Hanks
of this generation.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.085
-No.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.754
Exactly, because he doesn't show it
to anyone. Just like me.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.256
Okay. That's fine.
I'm glad we could talk about this.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.510
That's what I wanted,
a dialogue between actors and directors...

06:27.386 --> 06:29.555
Yeah, she was
my freshman roommate.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.641
My family fucked me over so hard.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.726
She was the first person I trusted
after them.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.937
Well, I once had a roommate

06:36.020 --> 06:39.232
who I thought would be a lifelong friend
and my future maid of honor,

06:39.315 --> 06:41.567
but then one day
she announced that she hated me,

06:41.651 --> 06:44.612
and we haven't spoken since,
so people change.

06:44.695 --> 06:49.367
Hmm. Why would I agree to make a brisket?
I barely know what it is.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.452
Do you know what color
<i>The Joy of Cooking</i> is?

06:52.203 --> 06:55.373
Brisket

06:55.456 --> 06:56.332
Yeah.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.044
That's like, uh, the beef
from the lower part of the chest.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.045
Same with veal.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.841
The secret to brisket is you have to
baste it continually while roasting it.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.592
Since when do you know how to cook?

07:07.593 --> 07:11.973
Well, I do watch 15 to 25 hours worth
of cooking shows a week.

07:12.598 --> 07:17.103
<i>Chopped, Top Chef, Cutthroat Kitchen. </i>
<i>Guy's Grocery Games.</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:20.148
So do you just watch or can you cook?

07:20.231 --> 07:23.025
Oh, yeah. No, I know what I'm doing.
My parents used to work late.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.029
So, after school, I'd get home
and make dinner for the entire family.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.739
Could you help us, though?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.075
'Cause Mickey wants to reconnect
with her old friends,

07:31.159 --> 07:33.035
so maybe your brisket could save her.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.996
Yeah, I'm on it. Brisket is the main.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.373
And we'll build some apps around that,
figure it out.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.168
I've never seen you cook.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.837
-No.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.591
Yeah, I mean,
I know what I'm doing, though.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.219
We can do a basic rub.
Salt, pepper, cayenne.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.971
We can braise it with red wine.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.516
That's actually really nice, Randy.
Thanks.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.645
Chef Randy's on it. Cool.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.445
Can we just gather up, everybody,
real quick for one second?

08:07.528 --> 08:10.656
Just gather round here,
gather round, gather round.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.244
Um, a man is nothing without his friends,

08:15.328 --> 08:18.206
and all of you are more than friends
to me.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.291
You're family.

08:20.374 --> 08:24.253
And that's what I want this set to be,
I want it to be a family.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.340
So think of this
as the Olive Garden of sets, okay?

08:29.008 --> 08:33.679
But instead of unlimited breadsticks,
it's unlimited creativity.

08:34.305 --> 08:38.267
I want everybody to have a good time,
have fun, get along, okay?

08:38.351 --> 08:42.355
'Cause we're not just making a movie here.
We're making art.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.690
We're making something beautiful,

08:44.774 --> 08:49.403
and, um, I don't think we should be
ashamed to say that.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.449
There's no shame in trying
to make something beautiful. Okay?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.785
-Let's make some magic.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.287
-All right.
-Yeah!

08:58.371 --> 09:00.998
-To our places.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.833
Picture up and roll sound.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.544
All right, sound is...

09:04.627 --> 09:06.796
Ready?
-...speeding.

09:06.879 --> 09:11.842
Slate for <i>First Month, Last Month,</i>
directed by the Gus Cruikshank.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.346
Scene six, take one and slate.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.766
All right. And action. So, you'd move in on the 15th.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.440
Typically, I'd ask for first
and last months' rent,

09:26.524 --> 09:29.068
but you've got a great face.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.781
Hmm. Guess the last guy left in a hurry.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.164
I'm sorry.
It's just... He was a great tenant.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.167
I was really sad to see him go.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.837
Sound is picking up that drilling.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.215
Yeah. Guys, just hold on one sec.
Should we cut?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.718
No, we've got so much to shoot here.

09:54.176 --> 09:57.555
Uh, you know,
there's drilling in real life.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.557
-There's drilling here.
-Yeah.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.975
-There's drilling in real life.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.728
-Keep going. Sorry.
-Hey, all clear.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.063
-Hey! All right! Okay, go for it.
-Okay.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.358
No, scratch that. Sorry.
-Yeah, it's...

10:10.359 --> 10:11.902
You know, I

10:11.986 --> 10:15.281
Just thinking about it,
drilling sort of has sexual connotations.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.409
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-This is a seduction scene, so...

10:18.492 --> 10:20.244
All right.
Maybe it does work as subtext?

10:20.328 --> 10:23.247
I think that's really great.
Still rolling!

10:23.331 --> 10:26.292
Okay, the drilling is subtext for sex.
And action!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.669
Okay. Okay.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.339
You remind me of my ex-husband!

10:31.422 --> 10:34.175
-Mmm...

10:35.134 --> 10:37.219
I'm-- It's so loud.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.180
-Let's cut. Let's cut.
It's a cut.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.848
-That's a cut.
-Okay.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.141
-Uh...

10:42.224 --> 10:45.686
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no, let's go,
uh, just reset.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.606
No. Get out here.
Okay.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.358
Stay there.
-Stop.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.110
-And action!
-Action!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.112
You'd move in on the 15th.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.615
-Typically, I'd ask for first and last--

10:59.033 --> 11:00.785
Stop! Let's just cut. Forget it.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.161
Cut!

11:02.244 --> 11:03.746
If they're doing construction on the gym,

11:03.829 --> 11:06.040
I'm gonna freak out.
It's perfect the way it is.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.708
Hold on, I'll check.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.670
Okay. Can we lose anything here?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.837
Lose something?

11:11.921 --> 11:14.715
Yeah, our schedule's blown to shit
if we keep stopping like this.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.343
-Okay.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.011
-Yeah, great.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.263
-That's gonna take a lot of time to shoot.
-Totally.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.766
I'm only doing it
so he does something cool for his reel.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.767
Mm-hmm. I love it.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.519
And you can tell Chris?

11:26.894 --> 11:27.895
You let him know?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.943
-Chris is a really good friend of mine.
-Right.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.319
And...

11:35.403 --> 11:37.738
You're making me be a dick here to him.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.740
Well, he's a good friend of mine, too.

11:39.824 --> 11:44.495
Probably, no offense, but a better friend,
just 'cause I've known him longer and--

11:44.578 --> 11:45.746
I know him pretty well.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.540
Well...

11:47.665 --> 11:49.917
Do you know who his first crush was?

11:52.294 --> 11:53.629
-Emily.
-Yeah, I can--

11:53.712 --> 11:55.172
-I know--
-It was Emily.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.382
I knew it, but I couldn't get to it.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.592
But I knew it was Emily. Yeah.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.387
Okay. Cool, I'll go, uh, crush his dreams.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.640
Just, uh, you know...
We're all doing this for free.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.560
Thanks, Wade.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.604
Randy, when's it gonna be done?

12:11.313 --> 12:12.565
When it's amazing.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.401
You have to love and coddle a brisket,

12:15.484 --> 12:18.237
and when it's ready,
it'll slide right out of the oven,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.156
like a baby sliding out of the womb.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.575
-So you're not even close.
-That is correct.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.660
People are hungry.
Can you turn up the heat?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.162
It's at 320.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.830
I can pump it up to 340,

12:27.913 --> 12:30.708
-but I'm not crazy about that, Mickey.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.923
This is not who I am.
I'm not going over there.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.593
Roman is a good guy.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.805
He's a father. And I'm starting to think

12:45.639 --> 12:47.516
he never laid a hand on you.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.189
Whoa. What the hell, man!
-Tell it to the judge!

12:53.272 --> 12:55.441
Whoa. Whoa.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.151
-Gus!

12:57.234 --> 12:58.068
I'm doing the jump.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
Why didn't you go through the front door? Wade, did you tell him
to go through the front door?

13:01.739 --> 13:04.200
-I mentioned it.
-Yeah. I know. I wanna do the jump.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.409
No, we cut the jump.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.078
It's an easy jump.
I've practiced it on the volleyball court.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.414
Chris, if you're not
in front of the camera,

13:10.498 --> 13:13.125
it's not gonna be on camera.
You get that, right?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.503
-You fix it in editing.
Tell me you understand that.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.296
This light is broken.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.550
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe we shoot another scene right now.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.093
Maybe the thing out in the hallway.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.554
I wouldn't have gotten hurt.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.891
-It's not about the stunt.
-We know, man. You're the best.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.351
I'm sure it would've been a great stunt.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.478
It's that, if it's not on camera,
you can't...

13:33.103 --> 13:36.732
Fine. But it's a 15-foot,
barely even, jump.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.527
Pizza party!

13:39.610 --> 13:41.320
-Yeah, I got Supreme.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.364

Eat as quick as you can.

-Huh. Still working on it.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.533
-It's about fatherhood.
-Hmm.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.826
Is that too obvious?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.787
Oh, not at all. It was just
the right amount of obvious.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.583
And it actually very much spoke to me
when you sang about the shopping cart,

15:17.666 --> 15:19.877
because recently,
I was at the supermarket,

15:19.960 --> 15:22.212
and my shopping cart was hit by a car.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.090
So that was my number one part
of the song.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.175
See, right?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.718
Mm-hmm.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.179
Is this dinner
gonna have any actual dinner?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.598
Almost ready.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.357
So, did you guys ever decide
on a school for Harrison?

15:42.149 --> 15:44.944
We're leaning towards
Montessori school and...

15:45.736 --> 15:49.406
-Yeah, I care. Of course I care.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.451
What's the funniest thing
that he said this week?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.286
Um...

15:54.370 --> 15:58.457
Uh, well, he's been calling the toilet
the "white chair."

15:58.540 --> 16:00.334
-So cute. That's cute.
It's cute.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.794
Ooh, look at this!

16:01.877 --> 16:04.588
Speaking of chairs,
stay seated in yours.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.175
I present to you the amuse-bouche.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.636
That's right.

16:10.719 --> 16:14.431
They are stuffed half olives
with a chili glaze.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.225
Whoa, Randy,
that is so impressive.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.644
Is Gordon Ramsay back there
screaming at you

16:18.727 --> 16:20.521
to make everything so small?

16:20.604 --> 16:22.773
-It's great!

16:22.856 --> 16:26.068
No, it's just me and Grandpa back there.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.987
Which one's the cook

16:28.737 --> 16:32.157
There's one for each of us,
and there's an extra one for the chef.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.786
Yeah, uh, when does the actual food come?

16:36.578 --> 16:39.873
Um, all right. Cards on the table.
Um...

16:39.957 --> 16:44.086
The amuse-bouche set me
back a bit, so it's gonna be a while.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.422
Jesus. Should I go and grab a burger?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.465
No! No, no, no. This is good.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.842
We'll go smoke,

16:49.925 --> 16:51.677
and that'll take your mind off
of the food,

16:51.760 --> 16:53.762
and you two will be fine
by yourselves, right?

16:53.846 --> 16:58.434
Oh, absolutely. I mean, I run
focus groups, so I love to just listen.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.894
Great! And you will get to cooking.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.521
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay. Come on, let's go.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.441
Hey, Ruby.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.526
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.445
I'm putting the vest on right now.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.781
Okay.
So, I'm gonna go like this. Okay?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.659
And then you activate the squibs, okay?

17:16.076 --> 17:18.537
That's when you set it off.
Boom, boom, boom, boom. Okay?

17:18.996 --> 17:20.789
-Okay.
All right. All right.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.126
-So we only really got one shot at this.
-Yeah, I know.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.546
I only have a single set of squibs,
and it costs $400, so...

17:27.629 --> 17:29.339
Oh! $400?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.426
-Yeah, that's--
-You got ripped off, man.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.846
-The guy at <i>Witchita</i> sold me the squibs.
-You're getting ripped off!

17:35.929 --> 17:37.139
Sorry, Wade. I gotta talk to you.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.726
So I was thinking that I wanna add
a slight facial tic to my character.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.936
At first, it's an eye thing.
Like this.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.606
-Or a mouth... A very subtle...
-Uh-huh.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.650
-Yeah. No, no, no. We could do that.
-Like a thing...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.402
-Yeah.
-Yeah. It's just like--

17:50.486 --> 17:52.196
Oh!

17:52.279 --> 17:55.824
Holy shit! Were we rolling?
We were rolling, right?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.242
Of course not. Nobody said... -We were talking.
-No!

17:58.744 --> 17:59.745
What

17:59.828 --> 18:01.580
-Ruby!

18:01.663 --> 18:03.707
No!

18:03.791 --> 18:04.917
We weren't rolling.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.669
-I didn't give you the signal.
-You went like this!

18:07.753 --> 18:10.255
No! No! No! No! I was like this!

18:10.339 --> 18:11.840
I wasn't like this.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.093
-This is different than this.
Oh, shit!

18:14.176 --> 18:15.844
This is different than this.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.554
-It did look cool, though.
Yeah.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.098
I told you he's the wrong man
for the job.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.307
You could use CGI.

18:20.390 --> 18:21.642
You know what, guys? Uh...

18:21.725 --> 18:24.186
Hey! Hey!
Uh, could I get five minutes?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.395
No problem.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.941
Just give me five minutes
just to...

18:29.024 --> 18:32.194
Okay, all right,
that's a hard fiver, folks.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.699
People keep asking me
if it's a concept album.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.992
I don't know.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.078
Just trying to do something different.

18:41.745 --> 18:45.415
Yeah, I liked how the guy went
from diapers to diapers.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.959
It was very full circle.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.129
Well, the idea is that each song
is a year of the guy's life.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.132
Yeah, I got that.
It was exactly like the movie <i>Boyhood.</i>

18:53.841 --> 18:55.300
I can't believe you said that.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.971
That's exactly the reference
I'm going for, and nobody gets it.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.182
Dude, it's super obvious.
You copied the movie.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.725
Wow.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.020
You, uh...
you don't really pull any punches, do you?

19:07.104 --> 19:09.273
No. It's kind of my brand.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.650
-Mm-hmm.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.901
That's my brand.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.407
It is.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.493
-There was a time. It was a long time ago.
A lot has changed.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.456
You used to like to have fun.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.418
-It was crazy times. We were younger...
-Mm-hmm.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.504
Some of us have to grow up.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.675
Yeah. True. But I'm trying, dude.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.011
You are trying.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.395
-We're short an onion.

19:48.478 --> 19:53.358
I'm gonna go check with your neighbor.
Brisket needs one more onion.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.653
Gosh. It must be nice to have a
friend like Mickey care about you so much.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.530
Tonight's pretty much all about you.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.451
It seems like
she went through a lot of effort.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.912
It's nice, I guess.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.414
And it seems like things are going well
with her and Gus?

20:08.165 --> 20:11.585
Oh, yeah. I'm just glad all that stuff
with Dustin's over.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.128
What?

20:14.838 --> 20:15.672
Oh.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.008
No, I misspoke.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.760
Did she hook up with Dustin?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.387
I don't know.
You know what? I don't know.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.014
I have the same amount
of information you do

20:24.097 --> 20:25.807
'cause we're both best friends with her,
which is nothing.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.684
Nothing happened. So, no.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.394
Fucking Mickey.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.064
It doesn't matter if she's sober
or has a nice boyfriend.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.899
She just hasn't changed at all.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.525
Fuck!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.862
My ex made me feel like shit.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.698
Like I wasn't enough.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.660
Like my family would be
better off without me.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.247
But with you, I feel like a man.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.457
Dude, this sucks, right?

20:50.540 --> 20:51.625
I know what you think.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.377
You think I don't know
what's been going on.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.879
I know what's been going on around here.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.839
I think he's fucking nailing it.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.759
You think he's nailing it?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.053
And I know what you want.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.473
Is that good, Gus?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.769
-Yeah. Uh, cut.

21:10.852 --> 21:14.523
You said Kevin would be done an hour ago,
and we have reservations at Asanebo.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.526
We're just running a little long here.
Okay?

21:18.360 --> 21:22.823
Don't hate me, but can we do
just one little more take?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.700
Just one more take? Just one more!

21:24.783 --> 21:28.537
You definitely have it, okay?
You're not shooting <i>Doubt.</i>

21:28.620 --> 21:31.415
I'd like to think we're trying
to be at the level of <i>Doubt.</i>

21:31.999 --> 21:34.960
Maybe we should wrap this up, Gus,
before things get ugly.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.670
Yeah. Um...

21:39.881 --> 21:42.217
-Let's wrap.
We're gonna wrap.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.429
-Thank you.
-Great! Great day, everyone.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.514
-Great first day, everybody.
-Great job!

21:47.597 --> 21:49.266
-Great day.
It's in the can.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.810
It's in the can. I like that. In the can.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.525
Oh, I have a missed call from Gus.
You go ahead.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.737
-Hey, see if he wants to come jam out.
-I will.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.869
How's it going, Mr. Spielberg?

22:08.952 --> 22:12.456
Not great.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.959
Ugh. Shit just kept happening today, <i>and we had to wrap</i>
<i>before I wanted to and... </i>

22:20.839 --> 22:24.676
I don't know. Maybe I'm supposed to be
the stooge at <i>Witchita, </i>you know?

22:25.343 --> 22:27.220
Do you feel good about what you got?

22:28.013 --> 22:32.059
No! I mean, the performance sucked.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.979
And then we had to stop
before we even got the scene.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.648
I feel like I fucking suck.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.859
Well, go back there and get it.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.695
Well, I can't. Everybody's leaving so...

22:44.237 --> 22:48.784
If they haven't left, it's not too late.
Go and tell them whatever you have to say.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.620
This is important. Get the fucking scene!

22:52.454 --> 22:54.206
Okay. Yeah. Um...

22:54.956 --> 22:57.334
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

23:05.383 --> 23:08.637
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

23:10.680 --> 23:12.265
Guys, wait. Um...

23:13.225 --> 23:19.022
I lied. This morning when I said,
"Hey, I want us all to have fun."

23:19.106 --> 23:21.525
I did! I meant it. But I also meant,

23:22.067 --> 23:26.738
"Hey, if this goes long, I just want
you guys to stay here and help me out

23:26.822 --> 23:29.324
because, you know what? You all owe me."

23:29.407 --> 23:32.160
I've done you all huge favors.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.957
Beth, remember when
I wallpapered your kitchen?

23:38.208 --> 23:42.170
Then I said, "Well, sure, but will you
help me out?" You said, "No."

23:42.254 --> 23:44.798
-Coachella, I went to Coachella.
-I know you went to Coachella.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.551
But that doesn't fucking matter
when I'm in your apartment alone.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.139
Dean, I helped you move
that fucking piano into your apartment.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.558
-Yeah, of course.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.561
I lifted it up the steps.
It got stuck on the wall.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.563
Then it moved and hit me in my dick!

24:00.188 --> 24:01.857
Yeah, hit your dick a bunch.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.987
Chris. You asked me to move
your weight machine for you.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.822
I'm moving stuff all over the place.

24:10.365 --> 24:14.786
This is coming out all wrong.
You guys, you don't owe me.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.163
The truth is...

24:17.622 --> 24:20.625
This thing's just
super important to me,

24:20.709 --> 24:24.629
and it's become this huge part of my life.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.426
And it's so huge that if it sucks,

24:31.219 --> 24:35.640
then that means I suck,
and I can't live with that right now.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.393
So, if you wanna go, you can go,

24:39.436 --> 24:42.230
but it would mean the world to me
if you just...

24:43.398 --> 24:45.692
if you stayed.

24:49.029 --> 24:53.116
Gus, come on, it's cool, man.
We can come back.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.159
Yeah.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.952
Let's do it.
Let's do it. It'll be great.

24:56.036 --> 25:00.332
-Okay. Thanks, guys. Sorry, I... ugh.
-It's no problem.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.708
It shouldn't be a lot.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.223
What?
-I'm sorry.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.475
I thought you already told her.
I'm really sorry!

25:18.558 --> 25:19.601
Told her what?

25:19.684 --> 25:21.978
I just thought you two are
so much closer than you and I,

25:22.062 --> 25:23.521
so you probably
would have already told her.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.529
What the fuck

25:32.113 --> 25:34.658
You say you're getting better,
but it's the same old bullshit.

25:34.741 --> 25:38.036
You think you'll just get away with this
and hope that Gus never finds out?

25:38.954 --> 25:42.999
Yeah. I did some fucked-up shit.
I can admit that. It's true.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.168
I can admit it.
I've done some fucked-up shit.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.920
But I am sober now,

25:47.003 --> 25:50.966
and I am really, really trying
so hard to make a change.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.803
The Dustin thing happened
after you got sober, Mickey.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.805
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:56.888 --> 25:58.932
-No!

25:59.015 --> 26:00.016
It's official.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.103
There's no such thing as a Mickey night
that doesn't end in screaming.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.814
Okay, fuck you, by the way.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.566
You're the reason I'm having problems
with Shaun in the first place.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.654
-You banned me from your house!
-I didn't ban you. She did.

26:13.905 --> 26:18.034
-Okay. I did. I did it. I'm sorry.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.579
I just can't take this anymore.
Drama follows you everywhere.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.456
No! That's an excuse

26:23.540 --> 26:26.334
for you being a shitty friend to me
ever since you had a kid.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.420
I'm not a shitty friend.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.380
This has been on purpose.
Can't you understand?

26:30.463 --> 26:33.800
I've been trying to get away
from this relationship for years.

26:37.262 --> 26:41.766
That is so mean.
And you cannot come back from that.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.603
Yeah, I know. I don't want to.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.693
I'm gonna get my purse.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.333
Where are they going?

27:10.503 --> 27:12.505
No. No.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.098
I can't have you mad at me all night.
Let's just talk about it.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.854
I guess I just wonder why you even wanna
be friends with me in the first place.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.231
I don't know what you get out
of this friendship.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.234
You're one of the most
amazing people I've ever met.

27:33.735 --> 27:38.365
Sometimes it gets messy and scary,
and everyone's yelling,

27:38.448 --> 27:42.535
but at least it's not boring.
Don't you know that?

27:45.789 --> 27:49.417
I don't know. Shaun seems to think
that it's not worth it.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.046
Maybe Shaun sucks.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.175
She does kind of suck since the baby.

27:57.717 --> 28:01.179
She wears cool outfits,
but she's pretty boring to talk to.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.932
Who would choose
to be married to that guy?

28:04.015 --> 28:05.392
He really sucks.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.770
Did you see the way she was looking at him
when he was singing those stupid songs?

28:08.853 --> 28:11.773
I know. She seemed very horny,
and it was gross.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.152
Do you want a brussels sprout?

28:17.278 --> 28:18.321
Yeah.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.032
Thank you.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.914
Hey. How was the brisket

28:27.997 --> 28:31.000
No, it's perfect.
You should be a professional chef.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.839
-Okay. Okay.
She's not kidding.

28:35.922 --> 28:40.051
-It'd be good if you tried to get a job.
-Yeah. That's fine.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.345
You could go to culinary school.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.057
And then what?

28:46.808 --> 28:48.476
You get a job as a chef.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.981
I'm glad that we're joking around again.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.613
Don't play coy.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.616
You think I don't know
what's going on here, but I do.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.580
-And I know what you want.
What's that?

29:09.998 --> 29:11.040
This.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.712
Don't mind if I do.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.381
-And cut! We got it!
-Yeah!

29:20.383 --> 29:22.302
Whoo

29:25.138 --> 29:27.140
-Uh...

29:27.223 --> 29:29.476
You know what?
I wanna fix one more thing.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.561
And action!

29:31.644 --> 29:35.857
I'll never do it! Never!
-Marco, no!

29:35.940 --> 29:39.235
You better look in the mirror, Gloria,
and make a change.

29:39.819 --> 29:40.904
Marco! No!

29:42.739 --> 29:44.824
Motherfucker!

29:44.908 --> 29:47.577
Oh, shit!

29:50.038 --> 29:51.164
Fuck! Shit!

29:51.247 --> 29:53.625
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

29:53.708 --> 29:56.544
Okay! Yeah, man.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.296
I did it!

29:58.379 --> 29:59.547
I got it, right?

30:00.673 --> 30:01.925
What a badass!
