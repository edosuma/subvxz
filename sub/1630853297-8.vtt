I think in episode eight,

49:56.645 --> 50:00.084
Ruddy has really reached
the middle of a bridge

50:00.127 --> 50:02.086
like he has in no
other episode.

50:02.129 --> 50:04.610
His way of doing things
is to go straight ahead,

50:04.653 --> 50:07.439
go at obstacles, be as
forthcoming as possible,

50:07.874 --> 50:09.702
and use his grit and guts

50:09.745 --> 50:12.444
to basically get through that
problem to the next stage.

50:12.487 --> 50:14.359
[GRUNTS]When he gets to episode eight,

50:14.402 --> 50:16.404
he reaches an immovable
obstacle

50:17.144 --> 50:18.189
in Joe Gallo.

50:18.232 --> 50:19.973
I'm in charge of your movie now.

50:25.457 --> 50:26.632
MILES: It's tough.

50:26.675 --> 50:28.590
You know, I think at
the end of the day,

50:28.634 --> 50:30.331
even though you're a
producer on this film,

50:30.375 --> 50:32.029
and you have to do
everything you need to do

50:32.072 --> 50:33.160
to get the job done,

50:35.075 --> 50:35.684
you know, you also need to be
able to go to sleep at night.

50:37.208 --> 50:38.905
You also need to remain
true to yourself,

50:38.948 --> 50:40.559
which I think Al always did.

50:40.950 --> 50:42.474
So what happens now?

50:42.517 --> 50:44.128
RUSSELL: He's warned
at one point by Caesar.

50:44.171 --> 50:46.478
I don't think that's
a line you wanna cross.

50:46.521 --> 50:47.566
Am I right?

50:49.698 --> 50:51.831
RUSSELL: The answer is, yeah,
he doesn't wanna
cross that line,

50:51.874 --> 50:52.875
but he realizes by
episode's end that he has
crossed that line

50:52.919 --> 50:53.833
and now he's gotta pay for it.

50:54.225 --> 50:56.096
So it becomes a very
conflicting moment

50:56.140 --> 50:58.272
and he relies on the only
person he can in Bettye

50:58.316 --> 51:00.709
to talk it through
and to see what to do.

51:00.753 --> 51:03.582
He's not afraid to fight
for it, but at the same time,

51:03.625 --> 51:06.411
I think he also kept a
pretty good moral compass.

You're doing the right thing.

GIOVANNI: One could almost
make the argument

51:15.550 --> 51:18.118
that there's filmmaking
before The Godfather,

51:18.162 --> 51:20.164
and then there's
filmmaking after.

51:20.207 --> 51:22.557
Not just filmmaking,
cinematography,

51:22.601 --> 51:24.733
and acting, and editing.

51:24.777 --> 51:27.388
I think that there were
sort of winks and nods

51:27.432 --> 51:28.911
and Easter eggs.

51:28.955 --> 51:31.697
There were truly,
in the actual real life

51:31.740 --> 51:34.917

trust me, you don't

got shot by the fruit."

in the same area,
and not only that,

52:10.953 --> 52:12.433
like, that would be
crazy in and of itself,

52:12.477 --> 52:15.306

the story
about what happened

we have a cross-cutting
feature that happens.

link to the movie.

52:28.971 --> 52:29.015
when we were starting
to talk about
the end of this

52:30.538 --> 52:31.191

we thought
we have to juxtapose

52:31.235 --> 52:32.410
these two things.

52:32.453 --> 52:33.715
So while we're at Umberto's,

we are on our set

react to what
we're not seeing.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.027

Yes, yes.

the oranges stand for.

From what I understand,

52:50.428 --> 52:52.430
Coppola did not write
the script that way.

52:52.473 --> 52:54.562
I believe he found it
in editing.

52:54.606 --> 52:57.348
To me, it's one of t
he most brilliant
pieces of editing ever

52:57.391 --> 52:58.958
because it changed
filmmaking in a lot of ways.

every visual cue they need

to know exactly what
we're looking at.

It's absolutely
a complete homage
to The Godfather.
