WEBVTT

01:14.533 --> 01:16.577
He said no raise,
just like that.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.622
Told me that what I do here
isn't important enough.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.792
Not important enough.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.835
I'd like to see him talk
to you that way.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.964
You never had to swallow
any disrespect, did you?

01:28.047 --> 01:29.423
No, not you.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.884
And if you wanted something,
you just took it.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.431
But look at you now.
All you've got is me.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.183
And you're just about all I got.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.977
That's why I'm staying here.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.562
Even if they don't pay me
what I'm worth.

01:43.646 --> 01:46.524
You...
You listen to me.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.109
You're the only one
who ever has.

01:49.860 --> 01:50.903
Yeah, Herbst.

01:50.987 --> 01:53.030
<i>Boss wants to see you, Aaron.</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:55.116
I wonder if he changed his mind.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.743
Maybe this will bring me luck.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.845
Let me guess,
you're rehearsing for a play.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.180
You...
You were taping me?

02:18.264 --> 02:20.725
You've been spending an awful
lot of time in there, Aaron.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.393
And now we know
what you were doing.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.895
But taping me.
How could you?

02:24.979 --> 02:26.272
How could you?

02:26.355 --> 02:29.275
I have never seen such
sick behavior in my life.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.860
Clean out your locker.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.363
But, Mr. Chandler, I've done
good work for you and...

02:34.447 --> 02:35.781
And what, Aaron?

02:36.907 --> 02:38.951
You wanna take this
to the review board?

02:39.035 --> 02:42.496
You'll never win and everyone will
find out you're a...

02:43.873 --> 02:45.708
I'II clean out my locker.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.286
Not important enough, huh?

03:45.476 --> 03:46.894
Party time.

03:51.649 --> 03:52.969
This is Harris
on the sixth floor.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.152
Inque's loose! In...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.077
What does this little toy do?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.703
Careful, it's an exosuit.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.832
It amplifies effort
and increases endurance.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.375
And?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.545
When I tested it, it put
too much strain on my heart.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.847
You'd let a little thing
like a heart problem

04:14.880 --> 04:16.966
stop you from being Batman?
I don't believe it.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.885
- Would I lie to you?
- No.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.221
But you hold things back.
Lots of things.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.639
It's taken me, what, six months

04:23.722 --> 04:25.402
just to get you to show me
around the cave?

04:25.558 --> 04:27.878
That's because we've had a lot
of distractions, haven't we?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.907
Someday you're gonna tell me
the real reason

04:31.981 --> 04:33.357
why you stopped being Batman.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.779
What's that?

04:38.863 --> 04:40.698
It's an alarm system I set up.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.967
I've got it hooked
into the prison

04:41.991 --> 04:43.242
and a few other places.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.619
Helps me keep track
of certain friends of ours.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.745
So which one is it?

04:48.873 --> 04:49.873
Inque.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.920
Downtown, Gotham Cryogenics.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.717
- On my way.
- Terry.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.095
Just in case.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.810
Over there.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.400
Hold your fire.
She's letting the hostages go.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.709
What's he doing?
Is he crazy?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.464
No, you don't understand.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.426
Huh?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.311
So what you gonna do now?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.780
What are you waiting for?
Get her!

06:02.863 --> 06:04.448
But what about Batman?

06:04.532 --> 06:05.533
What about him?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.748
Can we block it off?

06:12.831 --> 06:15.376
Well, there are only
two entrances on this street.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.044
Then you got the next street

06:17.127 --> 06:18.546
and the one after that and...

06:18.629 --> 06:20.798
Maybe the Bat knows
something that'll help.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.973
Got some bad news.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.058
<i>Let me guess.
She got away.</i>

06:31.141 --> 06:33.269
And broke the Freeze gun
while she was at it.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.146
- But that wasn't the bad news.
- It gets worse?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.648
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

06:37.731 --> 06:39.851
<i>She knows where the entrance
to the cave is, remember?</i>

06:44.113 --> 06:46.490
Made her escape
through the city storm drain system.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.617
<i>As yet unexplained
is all the ice</i>

06:48.701 --> 06:50.119
<i>that was holding her
somehow melted.</i>

06:50.202 --> 06:51.912
<i>Lousy maintenance.</i>

06:51.996 --> 06:53.914
<i>Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon
has promised</i>

06:53.998 --> 06:55.499
<i>that no effort will be spared by...</i>

07:15.311 --> 07:16.854
Whist's the matter, Aaron?

07:17.062 --> 07:18.147
Surprised to see me?

07:19.565 --> 07:21.108
How did you know where I live?

07:21.525 --> 07:23.277
How could I not know?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.821
All those months of listening
to you prattle

07:25.904 --> 07:28.490
on and on
about your pathetic life.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.034
You could hear me?

07:30.117 --> 07:33.746
Yes, Aaron, I could hear you
and see you too.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.500
But don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.837
Not unless you're stupid enough
to try and call the cops.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.130
I won't.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.213
Are you sure?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.675
Good.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.636
You play this right

07:48.719 --> 07:51.138
and I might give you
a nice reward.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.350
I'd do anything for you.
Anything.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.602
I had a feeling you'd say that.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.363
Mind telling me
what you're doing?

08:07.780 --> 08:10.366
Sealing up the cracks.
Making sure she can't ooze in.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.534
You really think
she's coming here, don't you?

08:12.618 --> 08:14.161
She was here before.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.829
She knows the way.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.539
Does she?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.458
It was dark that night,

08:19.541 --> 08:21.710
and the Batmobile
goes awfully fast.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.379
And then
there's the way you drive.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.839
- You got a better plan?
- I do.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.133
It's called getting
to know your enemy.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.552
Inque left a little
of herself on your suit.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.929
I'll be at the microscope.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.977
What time is it?

08:39.061 --> 08:41.230
It's noon.
You like American cheese?

08:41.313 --> 08:42.564
I don't feel like eating.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.549
Uh, maybe you'd like
to wash up then?

08:47.069 --> 08:48.195
No, thanks.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.572
Um, you know,
you were in that storm drain

08:50.656 --> 08:51.675
for a pretty long time and...

08:51.699 --> 08:54.076
I don't like water, understand?

08:54.159 --> 08:55.159
Okay, okay.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.373
But there's not much else
this place is good for.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.377
Just sleeping, eating.
Washing up.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.212
And, uh, we've got hours

09:05.295 --> 09:07.131
before it's dark enough
for us to go outside.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.675
Well, maybe we'll think
of something to keep us

09:09.758 --> 09:11.927
busy until then, hmm?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.730
Still at it, huh?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.606
She can huff and puff
all she wants

09:24.690 --> 09:26.290
but she ain't gonna blow
this place down.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.985
I know why she hasn't tried yet.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.906
I ran some tests on her residue.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.784
The human part of her DNA
has been damaged.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.828
- Probably by being frozen.
- So?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.998
Back at the cryogenics place,
weren't you wondering

09:41.081 --> 09:43.500
why Inque didn't morph
into her human form

09:43.584 --> 09:45.544
and just walk out of there
with the other workers?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.129
Uh, yeah.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.299
- Kind of.
- Right.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.594
The reason she didn't do it
is because she couldn't.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.429
She can't go back
to her human form.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.740
And if I were her, I'd be looking

09:56.764 --> 09:58.265
for a good doctor right now.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.768
- You think?
- Yeah.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.370
There can't be too many
doctors or labs

10:02.394 --> 10:03.874
that do that kind of work
around here.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.814
Let's get on the computer
and make a list of...

10:06.190 --> 10:07.190
Oh.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.321
One other thing. It's not
as good as Mr. Freeze's gun

10:12.404 --> 10:14.406
but it's the best I could do
on short notice.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.536
Be careful.

10:23.791 --> 10:27.336
Hurry up, get it open.
Can't you do it any faster?

10:27.419 --> 10:28.796
I'm doing the best I...

10:28.879 --> 10:31.673
Yo, what are you two
hiding there for?

10:32.049 --> 10:33.383
- Oh...
- Um...

10:33.467 --> 10:36.720
Uh, just trying to find
a little privacy, officer.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.931
Yeah, yeah, privacy.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.436
Carry on.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.691
Don't you ever touch me
like that again.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.735
I was only trying to...

10:59.368 --> 11:00.368
Just get it open.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.397
Do they have
everything you need?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.026
I'll make do.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.532
Wait.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.306
You said there'd be a reward for me.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.872
Here? Now?

11:44.955 --> 11:48.458
Inque, what I want
more than anything

11:48.542 --> 11:49.835
is to be like you.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.128
You're serious, aren't you?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.296
Dead serious.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.214
The power you've got, I want it.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.511
I've been wanting it
a long time.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.013
Then you'll get it.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.021
What was that?

14:07.431 --> 14:08.807
Inque. Inque!

14:12.269 --> 14:13.770
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.484
You know, I once took
an assignment to kill him.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.111
Then do it, get it over with.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.114
No, not until I get
the old one too.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.839
It's not working.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.175
Oh, yes, it is.
I can feel it.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.142
Quick! I need more!

15:06.782 --> 15:07.908
You're beautiful.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.201
Hmm.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.667
It's some kind of arena.
Got a big glass dome.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.961
Looks like nobody has
been inside in years.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.464
- What else can you tell me?
<i>- Sony.</i>

15:22.547 --> 15:24.841
<i>I wasn't exactly awake when
they brought me here, but...</i>

15:24.925 --> 15:26.218
But what? Terry?

15:26.301 --> 15:28.178
<i>Terry, you all right?</i>

15:30.430 --> 15:31.430
<i>Answer me!</i>

15:32.849 --> 15:33.975
It's the old guy, isn't it?

15:36.228 --> 15:37.604
This is gonna be perfect.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.991
Tell him you're at the
old Gotham Hills Arena

15:41.066 --> 15:42.526
and he should come right away.

15:46.655 --> 15:47.655
Tell him.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.787
All right then.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.539
Hope you're still
listening, old man.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.374
<i>We are at the Gotham Hills Arena.</i>

15:57.457 --> 16:01.211
<i>Get over here right now
or Batman dies.</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:02.838
<i>No! Stay Where you are!</i>

16:02.921 --> 16:04.081
<i>She'll kill us both if you...</i>

16:10.387 --> 16:12.681
He'll be here. What is he?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.684
Your father? Grandfather?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.769
Well, I'll find out soon enough.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.116
- Inque.
- What?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.410
You know, my reward.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.537
Oh, yes, your reward.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.710
- This is how you want to be?
- Exactly.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.182
Then I hope it will be
everything you are expecting.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.112
Hello?

17:21.458 --> 17:24.002
She only gave me
half the treatment.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.262
You got away?

17:38.266 --> 17:41.728
He didn't get away
and neither will you.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.196
Oh, no.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.340
No!

18:19.057 --> 18:20.183
Out of my way.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.354
You promised.
You promised.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.689
[Unque]Losen

18:57.429 --> 18:58.429
No!

19:03.476 --> 19:04.644
No!

19:19.909 --> 19:22.495
Now do you believe me
about why I retired?

19:22.579 --> 19:25.498
Not entirely, but tonight
I am glad you didn't stay retried.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.714
Poor, deluded fool.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.681
Dinnertime, Aaron.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.808
The cook made your favorites.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.477
Mashed potatoes and peas.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.228
He made some fried chicken too

19:47.312 --> 19:49.606
but with the bones and all,
well, you know...

19:55.445 --> 19:57.572
Mmm-mmm, good, huh?

19:58.073 --> 20:00.033
So before I tell you
about all the things

20:00.116 --> 20:01.836
that happened to me today,
I wanna thank you

20:01.910 --> 20:03.828
for listening
these last few months.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.914
You're the only one who does,

20:05.997 --> 20:08.249
and you'll never guess
how much it means to me.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.835
Anyway, the store was
out of diet ice cream

20:10.919 --> 20:13.213
so I had to drive all the way
to the other store

20:13.296 --> 20:15.256
and I almost ran out of juice.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.675
I was late to the doctor,
but the good news was

20:17.759 --> 20:19.719
he got rid of the warts.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.096
Well, almost all of them.
