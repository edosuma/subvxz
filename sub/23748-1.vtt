07:06.526 --> 07:07.823
He's going in.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.518
Inspector!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.188
Chief Inspector.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.288
Hail to the chief.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.292
Come right in.
Good to see you.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.760
Your disguise
is ready for final fitting.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.663
I'm sure you will be pleased.
Inspector Clouseau is here!

07:47.767 --> 07:50.600
- Chief Inspector.
- Chief!

07:50.703 --> 07:53.797
I saw some
very interesting noses.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.374
Those noses over there
are for the amateurs.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.808
I have some
in my private stock.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.075
You always did
have a nose for noses.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.581
How are you?

08:04.684 --> 08:06.982
I'm sorry. Our Valentine Day
stock isn't ready yet,

08:07.086 --> 08:09.577
but we have
some beauties here for you.

08:09.689 --> 08:13.090
Let's try this one first.
Here's a marvelous one.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.463
All right.
Can we get that on there?

08:19.265 --> 08:21.256
- What do you think of that?
- Wait. Yes.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.530
I call this one
"The Way We Were."

08:24.637 --> 08:27.970
Do you like it with the profile?
It's from our Streisand line.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.510
You like it?
I don't like it, either.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.341
Sorry, I almost
took your nose with that.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.075
Let's try...
what are you doing?

08:40.385 --> 08:42.354
Come over here.
Let's try this one now.

08:42.455 --> 08:46.118
I think you will like this one.
It's very suitable for your face.

08:46.225 --> 08:49.217
It fits in with your lines.
What do you think of that?

08:49.929 --> 08:53.092
I call this one
"Wino and Roses."

08:53.199 --> 08:54.757
Did you notice that...

08:54.867 --> 08:58.030
The veins are quite lifelike,
don't you agree?

08:58.137 --> 09:00.605
I'm particularly proud
of the enlarged pores.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.264
Look at this one right here.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.904
I wasn't crazy about it, either.
We will try something else.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.811
- Something...
- Something's missing.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.713
- Something missing there.
- How about that?

09:11.817 --> 09:14.012
Does that supply it for you?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.246
That's very nice.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.152
There is a nose, Auguste.
That is a nose.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.885
You have a nose for noses.
Get the wigs.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.257
I always can tell immediately
I see the nose.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.762
We call this one
our "Inky-dinky-doo."

09:25.865 --> 09:27.730
That's from
our Inky-dinky-doo line.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.596
What do you have
to go with this?

09:29.702 --> 09:32.034
We will find something.
This will keep you very warm.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.333
This has
a nice effect with that.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.431
- That is too legal.
- Too legal.

09:36.542 --> 09:40.308
- I want something sort of...
- Here's something illegal here.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.075
Leave it to Dr. Balls!

09:43.182 --> 09:46.583
Auguste!
Look at what you've done.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.620
- You like it?
- You're a genius!

09:50.089 --> 09:51.579
- We need...
- Something.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.125
Something is missing.
I know what's missing.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.161
Here are some teeth
on the house.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.425
Let me see how they look.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.194
Perfect!

10:02.301 --> 10:06.795
- Look at this!
- You are a genius at your art!

10:06.906 --> 10:08.806
My dear boy!

10:10.543 --> 10:11.669
He's still inside.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.904
What do you want us to do
when he comes out?

10:14.013 --> 10:15.674
<i>Follow him.</i>

10:17.950 --> 10:19.008
Martha!

10:19.118 --> 10:22.383
Come down and wrap
the Chief Inspector's purchase, please.

10:24.824 --> 10:28.624
I've recently been doing
something very daring in a stump.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.186
Arm and leg. Only 900 francs
for the complete kit.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.160
It has been my experience that,
in an emergency,

10:37.269 --> 10:39.965
a stump can get in the way.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.473
Martha, you remember
Chief Inspector Clouseau?

10:47.179 --> 10:51.741
I never set eyes
on this gentleman before.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.954
Good evening, Martha.

11:01.427 --> 11:04.362
I cannot believe my eyes!

11:04.463 --> 11:08.229
That is because your husband
is a genius, madame.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.165
Wrap these up, please.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.562
I want that nose to go with it.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.838
- Impossible.
- Money is no object.

11:18.944 --> 11:23.074
That is absolutely the ugliest nose
I have ever seen in my life.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.551
It is so revolting,
it is a masterpiece.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.755
It is also Martha's own nose.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.721
My compliments, madame.

11:36.829 --> 11:37.955
It suits you.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.933
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.763
Thank you.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.465
I will get your bill.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.095
My God, Auguste,
what have you done?

12:16.202 --> 12:18.693
The left heel
is cleverly built up,

12:18.804 --> 12:21.500
which gives
added height and authority.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.740
But the real secret
is in the right heel.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.143
The life like clubfoot look

12:28.247 --> 12:32.616
is caused by a built-in spring
which digs into the ankle,

12:32.718 --> 12:35.186
causing excruciating pain.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.754
Very realistic, don't you think?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.416
Remarkable.
How soon can I have a pair?

12:39.525 --> 12:42.460
I can have them ready
for you by Wednesday.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.188
Thank you very much, madame.

12:44.296 --> 12:47.356
Auguste, my sincere thanks,
and to you, madame.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.333
You like the hand?
I'll pack them up with the shoes.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.063
We're having a hand sale.

12:52.171 --> 12:56.631
It will come in handy for scratching
in case you have any hand jobs.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.369
We will see you soon,
Inspector.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.968
- Chief.
- Chief Inspector. Good-bye.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.014
We'll see you soon.
Good-bye.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.608
Oh, my God!

13:06.719 --> 13:08.311
I've never...

13:08.420 --> 13:09.717
I can't...

13:09.822 --> 13:12.848
I've never been in such pain!

13:12.958 --> 13:16.587
Shall I kiss it
and make it better?

13:16.695 --> 13:18.788
It's not that bad!

13:19.165 --> 13:22.828
And, so for the third time
in the memory of modern man,

13:22.935 --> 13:26.393
the world's largest cut diamond,
the famous Pink Panther,

13:26.505 --> 13:27.767
has been stolen.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.341
Since the reign
of Akbar the Magnificent

13:30.442 --> 13:32.239
in the early 12th century

13:32.344 --> 13:34.209
<i>until therecent bloodless coup</i>

13:34.313 --> 13:38.010
<i>of the former colonel,</i>
<i>now president, Sandover Haleesh,</i>

13:38.117 --> 13:41.109
<i>the Pink Panther</i>
<i>has been the symbol of continuity</i>

13:41.220 --> 13:43.780
<i>of the Kurfili, therulingfamily</i>

13:43.889 --> 13:47.518
<i>of the tiny Middle East nation</i>
<i>of Lugash.</i>

13:47.626 --> 13:49.423
- <i>Princess Dala...</i>
- Yes?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.156
- <i>chief Inspector Dreyfus.</i>
- Send him right in.

13:52.264 --> 13:53.959
<i>...current military regime,</i>

13:54.066 --> 13:57.058
<i>who have kept the gem</i>
<i>under the tightest security...</i>

13:58.971 --> 14:01.531
I came as soon as I got
your message, Commissioner.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.437
- I commend your promptness.
- Thank you.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.669
You have heard
of the theft in Lugash?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.338
The Pink Panther.
Yes, of course.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.438
It is in all the papers.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.047
Soon, I imagine,
they will be sending us

14:13.152 --> 14:16.144
a request for assistance
in catching the criminals.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.053
I have already received
such a request

14:19.158 --> 14:21.149
from the president
of Lugash personally.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.696
I see. How many men
did the president ask for?

14:24.797 --> 14:28.494
Only one...
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.058
Clouseau?

14:31.170 --> 14:33.070
See that he is
on the next plane.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.730
Of course.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.899
But, Commissioner,

14:37.009 --> 14:41.070
don't you think that someone
more conventional would...

14:41.180 --> 14:44.240
not to take anything
away from Clouseau...

14:44.350 --> 14:48.912
but, in view of the tense situation
in the Middle East...

14:49.021 --> 14:52.787
I am aware of the tense situation
between you and Clouseau.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.123
However,
Lugash has requested Clouseau,

14:56.228 --> 14:57.525
and Clouseau they will have.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.689
Your finger's in my ink.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.138
What's he doing in there?

16:58.417 --> 17:00.146
Hello!

17:00.252 --> 17:02.550
Nice weather we are having.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.961
I had hoped
we had finally laid to rest

17:10.061 --> 17:13.190
your obsession
with Inspector Clouseau.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.358
So had I, Doctor.

17:17.002 --> 17:21.165
Something has happened
to bring on this relapse?

17:21.272 --> 17:23.263
No, not something.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.606
Someone.
The one.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.570
No, perhaps you're right.

17:29.681 --> 17:33.515
Something.
He is a thing.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.747
- Clouseau?
- Yes, Clouseau.

17:37.289 --> 17:41.783
Your compulsion
to kill Clouseau... is it also back?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.260
Yes, right back.

17:44.963 --> 17:48.729
The thought of a world without
Clouseau fills me with delight,

17:48.834 --> 17:52.463
like a summer
with a thousand Julys.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.268
It intoxicates my soul with...

17:56.375 --> 17:59.071
- Your eyes.
- What?

17:59.178 --> 18:02.739
"Intoxicates my soul
with your eyes."

18:02.848 --> 18:06.784
You lapsed into the lyrics
of <i>You Go to My Head.</i>

18:06.885 --> 18:08.614
I did?
I apologize.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.518
Never apologize
for Cole Porter.

18:11.623 --> 18:17.152
Besides, your subconscious
has confirmed what we already know.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.230
That Clouseau
has got into my head.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.390
Precisely.

18:23.001 --> 18:27.097
How do you suppose you are
going to get him out of there?

18:27.206 --> 18:29.140
I don't know.
I don't suppose.

18:29.241 --> 18:32.836
You are supposed to suppose
and give me all the answers!

18:32.945 --> 18:35.209
The commissioner
wants him in Lugash.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.078
Let the commissioner handle it!
I don't want to know.

18:38.183 --> 18:41.448
I don't want to be there.
I want to be here with you.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.388
What are you thinking, Doctor?

18:51.497 --> 18:54.091
It wasn't Cole Porter.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.963
It was Gillespie and Coots.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.870
The deputy commissioner
to see you.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.097
The commissioner?
Send him in immediately.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.078
Come in, Commissioner.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.374
I want to discuss
the Pink Panther robbery.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.451
I am at your service,
Commissioner.

19:46.552 --> 19:50.044
Allow me to offer you
a small cigar.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.352
Swine cigars. Pay no attention
to them whatsoever.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.757
Let them roll.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.194
Read this most carefully.
Give me your opinion.

19:59.298 --> 20:02.825
I will read my opinion
and give you yours most carefully.

20:09.107 --> 20:13.203
- Do you have a light?
- In the top left-hand drawer.

23:14.893 --> 23:18.192
I'm dancing in the rice

23:18.296 --> 23:21.163
Just dancing in the rice

23:23.235 --> 23:25.999
What a wonderful feeling

23:26.104 --> 23:29.130
I'm... happy in the rice

23:29.241 --> 23:31.209
Always happy...

23:33.478 --> 23:34.945
Allow me.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.394
Excuse me.

23:54.866 --> 23:58.165
Clouseau called. He wants me
to take him to the airport.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.828
Then take him.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.874
Let the president of Lugash worry
about his blood pressure a while.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.876
- He's not going to Lugash.
- What?

24:06.978 --> 24:09.606
He's booked
on the 12:15 flight to London.

24:09.714 --> 24:13.445
He suspects the Phantom
to be responsible for the robbery.

24:13.552 --> 24:16.112
He said that since Sir Charles
lives in England...

24:16.221 --> 24:18.519
Sir Charles Litton lives
in the south of France.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.285
Yes, sir.
Shall I tell him?

24:21.393 --> 24:27.025
Don't bother.
He would just say, "I know that."

24:27.132 --> 24:29.100
Trying to talk sense to Clouseau

24:29.201 --> 24:35.037
is like Einstein trying
to explain relativity to a "minkey."

25:13.478 --> 25:16.811
Does Sir Charles know
you're coming?

25:17.749 --> 25:21.150
No, I want it
to remain a surprise.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.319
What's wrong?

25:25.423 --> 25:29.291
Your pop-out lighter
is refusing to pop out.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.322
It's supposed to
pop out automatically

25:32.430 --> 25:34.557
when it reaches
a specific temperature.

25:34.666 --> 25:38.796
What exactly is this
specific temperature?

25:38.904 --> 25:40.235
I don't know.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.272
You should have checked
with the factory.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.899
It is obvious
that this pop-out lighter

25:45.010 --> 25:48.468
has reached this
specific pop-out temperature

25:48.580 --> 25:51.208
and is refusing to pop out.

25:51.816 --> 25:55.377
First rule for the car owner...
knowyour automobile.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.284
But it is your automobile.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.450
I know that,
but it is not my pop-out lighter.

26:01.560 --> 26:07.556
If it were, I would know
the specific pop-out temperature.

26:19.611 --> 26:22.273
Clouseau was trying
to fix the lighter.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.008
He's sure that someone
planted a bomb in the car.

26:25.116 --> 26:28.847
Yes, someone should have...
I mean, could have done that.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.981
He wired Scotland Yard
and said he was arriving in disguise.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.786
Disguise?

26:36.294 --> 26:38.626
What kind of disguise?
Disguised as what?

26:43.535 --> 26:45.059
Didn't say.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.371
How are we going to tell
how to look for him?

27:14.699 --> 27:16.997
- Don't bother.
- Thank you.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.476
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your captain speaking.</i>

28:37.582 --> 28:40.050
<i>Pleasereturn to your seat</i>
<i>and fasten your seatbelt.</i>

28:40.151 --> 28:43.018
<i>There is turbulence ahead.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:22.320 --> 30:24.754
Yes, very good trip.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.653
Morning, sir.
Enjoy your trip?

30:26.758 --> 30:29.318
Yes, yes.
Thank you.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.258
- Thank you.
- Morning, madame.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.935
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.

31:01.159 --> 31:04.651
Inspector Clouseau,
I'm Drummond from Scotland Yard.

31:04.762 --> 31:10.257
I am Henri Botot,
mustard salesman from Dijon.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.536
Can I give you a lift,
Monsieur Botot?

31:16.641 --> 31:18.768
That would be
very kind of you, Mr. Yard.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.710
- Drummond.
- How is Scotland these days?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.781
- Pardon?
- Scotland.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.978
I have some relations
who are from Scotland.

31:28.086 --> 31:30.452
My grandmother
on my father's side.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.682
I'm quite fluent in Gaelic.

31:33.992 --> 31:38.361
It is the night of moons
on the night of Gladez.

31:41.799 --> 31:45.098
Inspector McLaren,
this is Monsieur Botot...

31:45.203 --> 31:46.727
From Dijon.

31:46.838 --> 31:47.805
How do you do?

31:47.906 --> 31:51.535
I was just telling Sergeant Yard
about my father-in-law's sister

31:51.643 --> 31:53.975
on my sergeant's side.

31:56.948 --> 31:58.745
You go round the back.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.975
At last.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.045
My own house,
my own swimming pool.

32:32.016 --> 32:36.646
My own 38-23-38.

32:36.754 --> 32:38.119
Telegram.

32:38.222 --> 32:39.689
Read it to me.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.885
"Dear Chief Commissioner,
happy birthday.

32:42.994 --> 32:47.488
Hope you enjoy
the 3,000 pounds of Jell-o."

32:48.232 --> 32:50.962
3,000 pounds of Jell-o?

32:51.069 --> 32:53.367
There must be some mistake.

32:53.471 --> 32:57.237
Where would I put
3,000 pounds of Jell-o?

32:58.743 --> 33:01.405
Besides, only Clouseau
would be stupid enough

33:01.512 --> 33:04.845
to send me
3,000 pounds of Jell-o.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.595
Hello, yes?

33:23.001 --> 33:26.095
This is Inspector Drummond
of Scotland Yard.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.502
I know it's late.
I hope I didn't wake you up.

33:28.606 --> 33:31.769
It's quite all right.
In fact, you did me a favor.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.605
Who is it?

33:35.113 --> 33:37.013
What can I do for you,
Inspector?

33:37.115 --> 33:39.743
It's about Inspector Clouseau.

33:39.851 --> 33:45.847
Ml5 called and reported
that Libyan agents heard a rumor

33:45.957 --> 33:48.482
that there might be
an assassination attempt

33:48.593 --> 33:50.060
against Clouseau.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.460
Really?
Who else wants to kill him?

33:53.564 --> 33:56.465
I mean, who is behind it?

33:56.567 --> 34:00.867
We don't know, but it comes
from a reliable source.

34:00.972 --> 34:05.238
We've told Clouseau,
but he just laughed and said...

34:07.145 --> 34:10.911
"'The moving finger writes."'

34:11.014 --> 34:12.641
Finger.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.949
When it's Clouseau,
he could mean anything.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.353
- Do you know what time it is?
- Willyou shut up?

34:22.726 --> 34:24.717
No, not you.

34:24.829 --> 34:28.060
- <i>Where is he now?</i>
- At his hotel.

34:28.166 --> 34:31.226
I think you should order him
back to Paris

34:31.335 --> 34:34.099
until we verify this rumor
one way or another.

34:34.205 --> 34:37.538
Under no circumstances
allow him to go to Lugash.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.556
Do you have for me
the message?

34:57.995 --> 35:01.487
- You want a massage?
- If you have one for me, yes.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.193
Why don't you try Tokyo Lil
at the end of the block?

35:04.302 --> 35:09.706
Ask for Passionflower Shirley,
the Yokohama Butterfly.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.640
- Why should I do that?
- You want a massage, don't you?

35:12.743 --> 35:15.678
Yes, but I want it from you.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.648
- Sir, I don't give massages.
- You gave me one this morning.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.513
You're mistaken.

35:21.619 --> 35:25.146
Don't you try the tricks <i>Anglais</i>
with me, monsieur.

35:25.256 --> 35:27.417
I received a message
this morning

35:27.525 --> 35:30.460
from Inspector Quinlan
of the Yard of Scotland.

35:30.561 --> 35:33.394
- The message!
- You gave it to me!

35:33.498 --> 35:35.466
Message.
You mean "message."

35:35.566 --> 35:38.034
I know what I mean,
you lunatic.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.934
Do you or do you not
have for me the message?

35:45.042 --> 35:49.979
No, sir.
For you there is no message.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.052
Grouse-Moor Hotel.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.317
- <i>Inspector clouseau.</i>
- Leaving?

36:03.928 --> 36:07.295
He just went up
to his room. I'll ring.

36:07.398 --> 36:08.797
<i>Thank you.</i>

36:29.954 --> 36:33.481
Yes? This is
Chief Inspector Clouseau.

36:34.592 --> 36:36.924
Turn your bed down, sir.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.576
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

37:01.852 --> 37:04.116
Yes? You were saying?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.701
<i>Idiot! Can you hear me?</i>

37:32.717 --> 37:36.209
Now then... what was that
you were saying?

37:58.676 --> 38:00.735
Your message!

38:03.981 --> 38:05.972
Your phone.

38:16.927 --> 38:19.987
To the airport, my good man,
and drive like the wind.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.257
Right, sir.

38:32.109 --> 38:34.577
I knew that.

38:35.546 --> 38:38.515
I've got a headache.
I don't want to hear another word.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.483
Every time you get mixed up
with Clouseau...

38:41.585 --> 38:43.553
- That's enough!
- What are you doing?

38:43.654 --> 38:45.952
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- You can't.

38:46.057 --> 38:49.049
The same thing I've been doing
every morning for the last two years.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.286
You can't!

38:50.394 --> 38:54.455
I'm sick and tired of you telling me
what I can do and what I can't.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.499
Suit yourself.

39:00.571 --> 39:04.234
I hope you like
the new pool cover you ordered.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.272
I think you made
a mistake, Colonel.

39:10.381 --> 39:13.714
Wrong, and never call me
"Colonel," Colonel Bufoni.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.651
I am nowyour president
and I am infallible.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.779
It says so
in the new constitution.

39:18.889 --> 39:21.619
That you wrote yourself
when you were still a colonel.

39:21.726 --> 39:25.184
You were a captain,
which you could soon become again.

39:25.296 --> 39:29.699
Yes, Mr. President.
It's just that sending for Clouseau...

39:29.800 --> 39:31.529
...was a stroke of genius.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.934
He found the Pink Panther before.
He will find it again.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.371
Possibly.
And then?

39:37.475 --> 39:41.502
Then... the grateful people
of Lugash will shower me,

39:41.612 --> 39:46.413
President Haleesh, with praise
and honor and their daughters.

39:46.517 --> 39:51.648
And the insurance companies
which have already paid

39:51.756 --> 39:54.384
our government's claim
of $12 million

39:54.492 --> 39:57.052
for the theft of the Pink Panther...

39:57.161 --> 39:59.686
what will they shower you with?

40:01.165 --> 40:03.963
Why didn't you mention this
before I sent for Clouseau?

40:04.068 --> 40:07.231
You didn't tell me till now
that you'd requested assistance

40:07.338 --> 40:09.431
from somebody else's
police force.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.508
Maybe we can withdraw
the request.

40:11.609 --> 40:15.739
Not we, Mr. President... you.
Only you can't.

40:15.846 --> 40:20.340
Clouseau's plane, at this minute,
is winging its way to Lugash.

40:22.486 --> 40:26.081
Perhaps he won't find
the Pink Panther.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.454
Perhaps he won't reach Lugash.

40:28.559 --> 40:33.189
- Colonel, you wouldn't.
- To save my president.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.458
Do what you must, Colonel.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.727
Just don't tell me about it.

40:37.835 --> 40:42.363
The president's conscience
must be unblemished.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.908
You understand
my meaning, General?

40:47.011 --> 40:52.176
As the hand understands
the glove, o Great one.

40:56.520 --> 41:00.149
Try to get control of yourself,
my friend.

41:00.257 --> 41:02.987
Giving in
in this way is not healthy.

41:03.093 --> 41:06.221
If I were healthy,
why would I be here, Doctor?

41:06.330 --> 41:09.458
I was referring
to your blood pressure.

41:09.567 --> 41:15.005
I see. He's such a maniac,
such an idiot, such a fool.

41:15.105 --> 41:17.403
And such a lucky fool.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.102
He would fall backwards
down a manhole

41:20.211 --> 41:23.647
and wind up
in the arms of Brooke Shields.

41:23.747 --> 41:27.114
Now London half in ruins

41:27.218 --> 41:31.314
and Lugash, a helpless desert
country, about to be devastated.

41:31.422 --> 41:35.381
- Get hold of yourself.
- I'm trying.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.724
You don't want to end up
at Happy Acres again.

41:38.829 --> 41:43.391
No, but until Clouseau is
out of my hair,

41:43.501 --> 41:47.528
out of my life forever,
I'm doomed.

41:47.638 --> 41:50.004
I'll never smile again.

41:50.107 --> 41:55.568
Frank Sinatra with the Pied Pipers
and Tommy Dorsey.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.544
I'm falling apart

41:57.648 --> 42:01.709
and you go down memory lane
with your silly jazz.

42:02.419 --> 42:05.388
They know not to interrupt me
when I am with a patient

42:05.489 --> 42:08.219
unless it is an emergency.

42:08.325 --> 42:10.816
- Hello?
- <i>Emergency call for the inspector.</i>

42:12.229 --> 42:18.259
It would seem the emergency
is not mine but yours.

42:24.074 --> 42:27.202
- I have terrible news for you.
- What?

42:27.311 --> 42:29.802
Inspector Clouseau's plane
is missing.

42:29.914 --> 42:34.248
- You are sure?
- <i>Positive. I am sorry.</i>

42:34.351 --> 42:37.787
I'll be right there.
Thank you.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.948
Dr. Longet, good-bye.

42:44.995 --> 42:48.829
You see before you
a man reborn, cured, sane,

42:48.933 --> 42:50.457
sound as a Swiss franc.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.833
- The phone call was good news?
- Wonderful news.

42:53.938 --> 42:58.500
Clouseau's plane is overdue
and presumed lost into the sea

42:58.609 --> 43:00.975
and out of my life forever.

43:01.078 --> 43:04.445
I'm going to wash that man
right out of my hair.

43:04.548 --> 43:09.008
I know...
Mary Martin, <i>South Pacific.</i>

43:10.220 --> 43:12.518
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

43:12.756 --> 43:15.748
I'm going to wash that man
right outta my hair

43:37.982 --> 43:39.745
She's here.
Come in.

43:45.689 --> 43:49.625
I think this is a mistake.
Tell her I'm out of town on a case.

43:49.727 --> 43:52.594
- Do you think that's wise?
- You think talking to her is wise?

43:52.696 --> 43:54.857
You were
his immediate superior.

43:54.965 --> 43:59.231
"Were."
You really think he's past tense?

43:59.336 --> 44:01.964
- It certainly seems possible.
- It would be wonderful.

44:02.072 --> 44:05.599
Sooner or later, a persistent reporter
like Marie Jouvet...

44:05.709 --> 44:08.109
What can I say?
What can I tell her?

44:08.212 --> 44:10.180
That I thought him an imbecile?

44:10.280 --> 44:12.578
That I thought he was
the luckiest man in the world

44:12.683 --> 44:15.652
with the brain
of a retarded clam?

44:15.753 --> 44:17.948
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

44:18.055 --> 44:21.513
You and I know he was an idiot,
but to the rest of the world,

44:21.625 --> 44:24.116
he was the greatest detective
since Sherlock Holmes.

44:24.228 --> 44:26.594
- If I tell the truth...
- Then don't.

44:26.697 --> 44:29.564
He's gone.
Give them the hero they want.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.692
It's no skin off your nose.

44:31.802 --> 44:34.862
But is he gone?
Is he really?

44:34.972 --> 44:39.068
I've got this ghastly feeling
that next week or tomorrow,

44:39.176 --> 44:44.079
I'll open the trunk of my car
or my closet, and..."Peekaboo!"

44:44.181 --> 44:47.446
Even so, I don't think
you have a choice.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.576
What if I don't bring it off?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.484
Where Clouseau is concerned,

44:51.588 --> 44:56.082
my emotions lurk below the surface
like a floating mine.

44:56.794 --> 44:59.763
- Oh, God, I can't do it.
- You can do it.

44:59.863 --> 45:03.026
I can do it?
Yes, I can do it.

45:03.133 --> 45:04.532
No, you do it.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.148
Miss Jouvet.

45:20.451 --> 45:23.784
Miss Jouvet,
how nice of you to come.

45:23.887 --> 45:27.516
Please make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a clam.

45:28.292 --> 45:31.261
<i>How would you describe</i>
<i>Inspector clouseau?</i>

45:33.630 --> 45:36.690
<i>I've never known</i>
<i>a man like him.</i>

45:36.800 --> 45:40.099
<i>He was...unique.</i>

45:40.204 --> 45:42.638
<i>Could you be more specific?</i>

45:42.740 --> 45:44.867
<i>I could be, but...</i>

45:44.975 --> 45:49.537
<i>To start with,</i>
<i>he was...unorthodox.</i>

45:49.646 --> 45:53.514
- <i>In what way?</i>
- <i>In every way.</i>

45:53.617 --> 45:57.519
- <i>can you give me an example?</i>
- <i>An example.</i>

45:57.621 --> 45:59.088
<i>Yes. For instance,</i>

45:59.256 --> 46:03.920
<i>to keep himself constantly alert</i>
<i>to any attack,</i>

46:04.027 --> 46:08.430
<i>he instructed his chinese</i>
<i>manservant to attack him</i>

46:08.532 --> 46:10.864
<i>wherever and whenever</i>
<i>he could.</i>

46:10.968 --> 46:13.937
<i>That's not only unorthodox,</i>
<i>it's bizarre.</i>

46:14.037 --> 46:16.835
- He sounds like a real nut.
- Shut up.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.704
<i>There wererumors</i>
<i>that you and he didn't get along.</i>

46:22.279 --> 46:26.613
<i>I suppose we occasionally had</i>
<i>our...little disagreements,</i>

46:26.717 --> 46:31.848
<i>but when you work</i>
<i>with somebody for 20 years,</i>

46:31.955 --> 46:35.152
<i>you can't always be expected</i>
<i>to see...</i>

46:37.394 --> 46:39.862
<i>...to see eye to eye.</i>

46:39.963 --> 46:42.261
<i>Then you think</i>
<i>he was a good detective?</i>

46:44.134 --> 46:45.863
<i>He was...</i>

46:45.969 --> 46:47.960
<i>I think he was...</i>

46:50.040 --> 46:52.600
<i>You can't just say</i>
<i>he was</i> a...

46:54.845 --> 46:58.747
<i>There are no words</i>
<i>to describe what hereally was.</i>

46:58.849 --> 47:00.544
<i>How about "genius"?</i>

47:03.921 --> 47:05.718
<i>That is a word.</i>

47:05.823 --> 47:08.257
- <i>courageous?</i>
- <i>courageous?</i>

47:11.595 --> 47:14.325
<i>The president</i>
<i>twice decorated him for bravery.</i>

47:14.431 --> 47:15.489
<i>Right.</i>

47:15.599 --> 47:17.567
<i>That sounds</i>
<i>like a courageous man to me.</i>

47:17.668 --> 47:20.694
<i>Yes, it certainly sounds</i>
<i>that way, hmm?</i>

47:20.804 --> 47:23.773
<i>He was reputed</i>
<i>to be a great athlete.</i>

47:27.144 --> 47:31.103
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what an athlete he was.</i>

47:31.215 --> 47:33.342
<i>A karate black belt.</i>

47:35.652 --> 47:39.281
- <i>A black belt?</i>
- <i>An expert marksman.</i>

47:39.389 --> 47:40.913
<i>A born leader.</i>

47:43.026 --> 47:45.017
<i>Inspector, I'm so sorry.</i>

47:45.128 --> 47:48.461
Oh, he's crying.

47:52.369 --> 47:55.236
This is Bruno.
I want a meeting right away.

47:55.339 --> 47:57.307
- <i>Who with?</i>
- Everybody.

47:57.407 --> 47:58.704
<i>Okay, boss.</i>

49:18.155 --> 49:21.318
It was part of your job
to attack him like that?

49:21.425 --> 49:22.585
Oh, yes.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.186
Cato, I'm back on the case!

49:30.734 --> 49:34.033
Now to set the trap,
catch the killer...

49:35.072 --> 49:38.667
...and prove to the world
that Maria Gambrelli is innocent...

49:38.775 --> 49:40.072
of murder.

49:41.745 --> 49:43.713
We'll have to accelerate
our training program.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.715
You must learn to attackwherever
and whenever I least expect.

49:46.817 --> 49:48.682
You must give no quarter.

49:48.785 --> 49:53.688
- Didn't anyone ever get hurt?
- Yes, mostly me.

49:53.790 --> 49:58.090
There was one time, however,
when the Mafia imported a ninja.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.858
The inspector
thought the ninja was me.

50:22.619 --> 50:24.450
Poor ninja.

50:24.554 --> 50:26.579
I know just how he felt.

50:26.690 --> 50:30.091
Now with your boss gone,
no more sneak attacks.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.388
You must be very relieved.

50:32.496 --> 50:35.294
Not entirely.

50:35.399 --> 50:38.891
Sometimes when you do something
long enough, you miss it,

50:39.002 --> 50:40.799
even if it was painful.

50:41.605 --> 50:43.937
What do you think happened
to the inspector?

50:44.041 --> 50:45.531
Beats me.

50:49.479 --> 50:52.073
- Inspector Clouseau's residence.
- <i>Marie Jouvet, please.</i>

50:52.182 --> 50:55.276
One moment, please.
It's for you.

50:58.655 --> 51:00.953
<i>This is Sergeant Duval speaking.</i>

51:01.058 --> 51:03.891
I have that information for you.

51:03.994 --> 51:07.122
Clouseau's former assistant
Hercule Lajoy

51:07.230 --> 51:11.098
is living on a river barge
called <i>The Moth.</i>

51:28.852 --> 51:32.151
- Hercule Lajoy?
- Who wants to know?

51:32.255 --> 51:34.223
Marie Jouvet.
I'm a television reporter.

51:34.324 --> 51:36.451
I know what you are.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.324
Can I come aboard?
I want to talk to you.

51:39.429 --> 51:41.795
- You want answers?
- Of course.

51:41.898 --> 51:45.527
How can I give you answers?
I am taking a nap.

51:45.635 --> 51:47.660
I'll wait untilyou wake up.

51:48.738 --> 51:50.330
All right.

52:00.851 --> 52:03.820
You're even better looking
than you are on television.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:06.990 --> 52:10.983
I have the distinct impression
that I was expected.

52:12.229 --> 52:14.993
Clouseau has disappeared.
You are a reporter.

52:15.098 --> 52:17.862
- Elementary.
- Spoken like a true policeman.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.731
A retired policeman.

52:19.836 --> 52:22.361
- May I sit?
- As you choose.

52:24.074 --> 52:26.133
You worked with Clouseau.

52:26.243 --> 52:28.507
Yes, he was unique.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.911
Intuitive, a man
who followed his hunches?

52:32.015 --> 52:33.983
Who can tell
what Clouseau followed?

52:34.084 --> 52:36.985
He was the most successful
man on the force.

52:37.087 --> 52:40.614
Everything I thought
made up a proper investigation...

52:40.724 --> 52:42.988
he did the opposite.

52:43.660 --> 52:47.187
Facts, Hercule.
Facts.

52:47.297 --> 52:49.731
Nothing matters
but the facts.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.825
Without them, the science
of criminal investigation

52:52.936 --> 52:55.268
is nothing more
than a guessing game.

52:57.507 --> 53:00.135
Listen to me
and you will learn something.

53:00.243 --> 53:03.770
The facts in this case are...

53:03.880 --> 53:07.509
the body of the chauffeur was found
in the bedroom of the second maid.

53:07.617 --> 53:08.982
Fact!

53:09.085 --> 53:11.747
Cause of death...
four bullets in the chest.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.846
Fact!

53:13.957 --> 53:15.982
The bullets were fired
at close range

53:16.092 --> 53:18.617
from a.25 caliber
Beretta automatic.

53:18.728 --> 53:20.161
Fact!

53:20.263 --> 53:23.892
Maria Gambrelli was discovered
with the murder weapon in her hand.

53:25.569 --> 53:29.027
The murder weapon was registered
in the name of the deceased...

53:29.139 --> 53:31.573
Miguel ostos...
and was kept, mark you,

53:31.675 --> 53:34.974
in the glove compartment
of the Ballon Rolls-Royce.

53:36.413 --> 53:39.382
Members of the household staff
have testified

53:39.482 --> 53:41.473
that Miguel ostos beat...

53:43.353 --> 53:45.651
Careful, you fool.
You've broken my pointing stick.

53:45.755 --> 53:47.746
I've got nothing to point with now.

53:48.825 --> 53:54.764
...have testified that Miguel ostos
beat Maria Gambrelli frequently.

53:54.864 --> 53:59.096
Finally comes the sworn statement
of Monsieur and Madame Ballon,

53:59.202 --> 54:02.035
as well as all the members
of the staff,

54:02.138 --> 54:04.402
each of them with perfect alibis.

54:06.409 --> 54:10.641
Now then, Hercule,
what is the inescapable conclusion?

54:11.915 --> 54:14.349
Maria Gambrelli killed the chauffeur.

54:14.451 --> 54:16.578
What? You idiot. Impossible.

54:16.686 --> 54:19.211
- She's protecting someone.
- How do you know that?

54:19.322 --> 54:21.654
- Instinct!
- But, the facts.

54:21.758 --> 54:24.625
You are forgetting
the most important fact... motive.

54:24.728 --> 54:26.889
- He beat her.
- He was Spanish.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.758
- He tore her dress off.
- Don't be ridiculous.

54:29.866 --> 54:32.664
Would you kill somebody
who tore your dress off?

54:34.204 --> 54:36.365
- I suppose not.
- Of course not.

54:38.975 --> 54:41.876
No, there is no doubt
in my mind whatsoever, Hercule.

54:41.978 --> 54:45.778
Maria Gambrelli is most definitely
protecting somebody.

54:45.882 --> 54:48.510
Find that somebody,
and you have found the murderer.

54:48.618 --> 54:53.055
And I shall find the murderer
before the day is out.

54:53.623 --> 54:56.490
Maria Gambrelli
will tell me who he is.

54:57.560 --> 55:01.496
Yet Clouseau was proved right.
Maria Gambrelli was innocent.

55:01.598 --> 55:05.830
Clouseau was always proved right
at the end of the case,

55:05.935 --> 55:09.735
but on the way, even he
made a few miscalculations.

55:32.295 --> 55:35.196
Now he is lost in the sea.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.562
I admired his successes,
but his methods...

55:38.668 --> 55:41.660
they made a mockery
of everything I knew of police work.

55:41.771 --> 55:45.138
So I quit,
but I have a good life.

55:45.241 --> 55:49.701
I carry a few cargos,
charter to a group of tourists in August

55:49.813 --> 55:52.577
when it gets too hot
to stay in Paris.

55:52.682 --> 55:56.982
Don't you miss it sometimes...
the excitement?

55:57.087 --> 56:00.022
Young lady,
if I missed the excitement,

56:00.123 --> 56:02.455
don't you think
I would bait my hook?

56:05.428 --> 56:07.726
Thank you, Hercule Lajoy.

56:07.831 --> 56:10.823
I like you, and I don't think
you're nearly the hard case

56:10.934 --> 56:12.731
you make yourself out to be.

56:12.836 --> 56:17.432
I like Hercule, too, just because
he is the hard case he seems to be.

56:17.540 --> 56:21.067
If you really want to get
to the bottom of this Clouseau thing,

56:21.177 --> 56:23.805
forget about the ones
on his side of the law.

56:23.913 --> 56:27.144
Dig up some of the crooks
he caught, or didn't catch.

56:33.656 --> 56:35.647
Call again when you're
in the neighborhood!

56:35.759 --> 56:37.727
Thank you.
I may do that.

56:39.863 --> 56:42.559
They only show
the top half of you on television.

56:42.665 --> 56:45.828
- I'm glad the bottom is as good.
- Me, too.

57:01.584 --> 57:02.812
How's business?

57:02.919 --> 57:05.444
- Better.
- Picking up.

57:05.555 --> 57:08.524
Clouseau disappears,
business gets better?

57:08.625 --> 57:10.684
- Sure thing.
- Yeah, boss.

57:10.794 --> 57:12.921
This Marie Jouvet...

57:13.029 --> 57:16.089
- She's snooping around.
- So what?

57:16.199 --> 57:20.260
Who knows? But I think
it's better if we put a tail on her.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.497
Louis, she's no dummy.

57:22.605 --> 57:26.234
- Pick a couple of good boys, huh?
- Done.

57:32.015 --> 57:34.245
<i>When I first met</i>
<i>Inspector clouseau</i>

57:34.350 --> 57:36.978
<i>about 20 years ago in cortina,</i>

57:37.086 --> 57:39.054
<i>I had a nasty ski accident.</i>

57:39.155 --> 57:43.615
<i>Unfortunately, clouseau happened</i>
<i>to be staying at the same hotel.</i>

57:45.328 --> 57:46.556
Sir.

57:47.330 --> 57:49.662
Excuse me.
My leg is caught.

57:49.766 --> 57:52.200
You were married
to Inspector Clouseau.

57:52.302 --> 57:53.428
Yes.

57:54.204 --> 57:57.071
Had you known Sir Charles
before Cortina?

57:57.173 --> 57:59.107
Only casually.

57:59.209 --> 58:02.235
I am willing to bet you
10,000 francs

58:02.345 --> 58:05.143
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment.

58:05.248 --> 58:07.216
Even, perhaps,
in this very room.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.979
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

58:10.086 --> 58:11.849
I agree with the inspector.

58:11.955 --> 58:15.083
Ten of his victims have been guests
at Angela Dunning's parties.

58:15.191 --> 58:19.355
- What are you all talking about?
- The notorious Phantom.

58:19.462 --> 58:21.430
I've never heard of him.

58:21.531 --> 58:24.432
The little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

58:24.534 --> 58:27.469
There are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

58:27.570 --> 58:30.164
Each theft is
completely different and unique,

58:30.273 --> 58:32.366
classic in its conception.

58:32.475 --> 58:35.603
I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

58:35.712 --> 58:38.579
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

58:38.681 --> 58:43.550
There is one other duplication,
but that is his trademark,

58:43.653 --> 58:46.053
his calling card, so to speak.

58:46.155 --> 58:49.716
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

58:49.826 --> 58:51.487
Sounds terribly theatrical.

58:51.594 --> 58:55.587
If I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

58:55.698 --> 58:57.427
Really? Who?

58:58.968 --> 59:01.163
Who owns the most fabulous
diamond in the world?

59:01.271 --> 59:03.899
- I suppose I do.
- The Pink Panther.

59:04.007 --> 59:07.135
Such a prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

59:07.243 --> 59:10.770
He'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at...

59:10.880 --> 59:13.474
Your Highness, please,
don't say it here.

59:13.583 --> 59:15.312
If I'm not being too nosy,

59:15.418 --> 59:19.013
I read that there was some dispute
over ownership of the Pink Panther.

59:19.122 --> 59:22.489
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

59:22.592 --> 59:25.152
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

59:25.261 --> 59:27.354
When the present government
seized power,

59:27.463 --> 59:30.159
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

59:30.266 --> 59:34.066
There's even talk of the international
court deciding the issue.

59:34.170 --> 59:37.333
Why don't I steal the diamond,
leave that glove behind,

59:37.440 --> 59:39.567
and you and I can split the insurance?

59:39.676 --> 59:41.200
All right.

59:41.311 --> 59:43.905
I feel like dancing.
Your Highness?

59:44.013 --> 59:45.537
I'd love to.

59:47.317 --> 59:49.979
- How about you, madame?
- Yes, of course.

59:51.054 --> 59:53.818
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

59:53.923 --> 59:55.914
I say, your leg is better.

59:56.025 --> 59:57.993
Much better, thank you.

59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.853
Mr. Tucker...

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.831
That's my beer.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:09.870
In May 1964,
you divorced Inspector Clouseau.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:13.568
- Ayear later...
- I married the man of my dreams.

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:14.836
Who was that, darling?

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:19.472
That fellow Clouseau accused
of being the notorious Phantom.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:23.382
Oh, him. You have to forgive her.
She's not very good on names.

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:27.183
- He's terribly attractive.
- But she has impeccable taste.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.020
What made Inspector Clouseau
think you were the Phantom?

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.718
An anonymous phone call.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.955
I see.
Come up immediately.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.531
Sir Charles.
The Phantom.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.760
I've really got him this time.

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:42.160
- Of course he was wrong.
- About what?

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:45.763
- About you being the Phantom.
- Of course he was wrong.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.433
Wrong, but persistent.

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.408
Persistent he was.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:54.779
<i>He was convinced I was planning</i>
<i>to steal the Pink Panther.</i>

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:57.944
<i>When Princess Dala</i>
<i>gave a costume ball</i>

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.922
<i>at her villa in Rome,</i>
<i>clouseau was there with his men.</i>

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.356
Warm?

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.757
Yes. Must be hell in there.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.421
But it's not so good in there.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:13.563
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.264
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there,

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.340
watching all the time.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.373
How dare you drink on duty!
Who is inside there?

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.576
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quash.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.120
Go on behaving like this
and I'll have your stripes!

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.314
The Pink Panther
was stolen that night?

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.857
By a gorilla.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.011
Come back.
It's me!

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.811
<i>To my dying day,</i>

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:33.439
<i>I'll never forget that old man</i>
<i>trying to cross the street.</i>

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.833
Come on, faster!

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.344
Hurry!

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.507
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive faster?

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.392
We've been down this street.
Come on.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:24.625
Quick! This is the road
they have gone up.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.894
Don't argue with me.
I know where they've gone!

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.385
George, any idea
how we get out of here?

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:47.115
I don't know. I've been up
this street, that one, that one.

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:49.783
- How are we gonna get out?
- Try the high road.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:52.190
I'll take the high road,
you take the low road.

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.263
- So long, Uncle Charles.
<i>- Ciao,</i> George.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.828
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.839
I see them!
That's them.

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:46.278
- No, it isn't.
- Yes!

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.031
<i>Believe it or not,</i>
<i>for a while,</i>

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:07.068
<i>it looked as though</i>
<i>clouseau himselfwas the Phantom.</i>

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:10.297
<i>He was arrested</i>
<i>for having stolen the Pink Panther</i>

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.374
<i>and sent to prison.</i>

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.534
Tucker!

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.675
But he was innocent?

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.681
Inept, but innocent.

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:23.308
- Inept?
- Wouldn't you say so, darling?

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.547
Not in everything, darling.
He was a terrific sleeper.

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:29.022
- It's hard to believe.
- It's true.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.992
He almost never made a serious
mistake while he was sleeping.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.586
I mean inept.
France's greatest detective?

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.928
It does test one's reality.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.468
- Do you think he's dead?
- I hope not.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.469
- What do you think, Sir Charles?
- No.

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:45.870
Men like Clouseau never die.
They're indestructible.

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.307
- That's the way it should be.
- Why?

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:50.174
We need them.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.543
They help us preserve
our sense of humor.

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.913
<i>They're living proof</i>
<i>that however bad things get,</i>

01:05:56.018 --> 01:06:00.682
<i>if you persevere, you survive</i>
<i>and sometimes even win.</i>

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.918
So you think determination
was the key to his success?

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.017
No question about it.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:10.155
He was a fool, but he epitomized
the 11th commandment.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.563
The 11th commandment?

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:14.568
Thou shalt not give up.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.366
- I like that.
- I thought you might.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.402
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.539
- Come and see us again.
- I may do that.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.450
The man of your dreams
is also a Machiavellian charmer.

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.419
I know that.
Thank you.

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:35.581
- Good-bye.
- Bye!

01:06:57.513 --> 01:07:01.176
- You've just passed the hotel.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.114
But that's where I wanted to go!

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:07.815
- You see that car following us?
- What about it?

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:12.883
The two men in that car suggested
I drop you off at another address.

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.690
What are you talking about?

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.630
It was more like a threat
than a suggestion.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.200
They threatened you?

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.792
One of them showed me
his brand-new gun.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.465
Who are they?

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.542
You'll think I'm not on the ball,

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:30.635
but I neglected to get their names.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.846
- You realize this is kidnapping?
- Yeah.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.544
I have to be honest with you.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:40.486
I couldn't come up with an alternative.

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.989
You can go to prison for life
for kidnapping.

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:46.721
Lady, the gun he showed me
was a.38 Magnum.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.854
I don't know anything about guns.

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:52.798
That gun makes
enormous holes in things.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.963
I had a choice between kidnapping you
and getting shot with that gun.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:01.533
To be perfectly frank,
I would look terrible and feel worse

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.112
with an enormous hole in me.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:26.064
Use it where it hurts the most.
Watch this.

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.947
Beat that. Miss Jouvet,
how nice of you to come.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.017
- Did I have a choice?
- Actually, no.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.086
Let's go where we can be in private.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:47.587
- Do I have a choice?
- I just want to have a little talk.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.180
- Watch your step.
- I always do.

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:56.459
Why the B-movie melodramatics?
You could have picked up a phone.

01:08:56.564 --> 01:08:58.863
- Would you have come?
- To see the French godfather?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:02.335
- Bruno, I'm a reporter.
- Aterrific-looking one at that.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.269
Take a swim.

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.343
Let's make ourselves comfortable.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.850
Have a seat.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:19.443
- Can I have a drink?
- Do I have a choice?

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:23.218
- Actually, no.
- How about some champagne?

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.486
Terrific.
Put a fresh peach in it.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.892
You heard the lady.
Champagne, put a peach in it.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.966
A peach?
Yes, sir.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:33.557
I never heard of a peach
in champagne before.

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.261
Very sexy.

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:38.067
- Make that two.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.136
What happens
if he doesn't have any peaches?

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:44.609
Something very melodramatic.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.978
If it gets to that,
I'll settle for plain champagne.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:54.615
Marie, you really are
some kind of sensational lady.

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:58.159
- Bruno, there is an old saying.
- What's that?

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.854
Never bullshit a bullshitter.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:05.592
I want you to lay off
on this Clouseau thing.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.970
- Take off your glasses.
- What for?

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.868
Then I can see what you're thinking.

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.665
I doubt that.

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:18.003
Why do you want me
to lay off Clouseau?

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:20.343
- Because I asked you to.
- That's not good enough.

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.041
It should be.

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.948
What if I don't?

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.819
When I was your age,
I used to sometimes wonder

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:36.660
what it would be like if I suddenly
found a whole lot of money.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:39.393
- Ever imagine something like that?
- Yes.

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:43.832
I even imagined that someday
someone might try to bribe me

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.497
with a small fortune.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:48.042
- What did you do?
- I was tempted.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:49.167
That's a good start.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.145
- But I said no.
- Not very bright.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:56.548
I'm a reporter... for better
or for worse, an honest one.

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.780
Tell me why you want me
to lay off Clouseau.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:02.448
I prefer things the way they are.

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.657
Clouseau created a lot of problems.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.958
A smart lady like you
could find out he's still alive.

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.929
Or dead.

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.763
I might even find out
that someone killed him.

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.273
You've got a beautiful face.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.706
Why stick it in where it doesn't belong?

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.471
It's my job.

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.809
What good is your job

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:28.883
if you gotta do your TVshow
from a hospital bed?

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.579
I knewyou were going to threaten me,
but I didn't know how I was going to react.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.251
- I've surprised myself.
- Is that right?

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.329
Instead of scaring me,
you have made me angry.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.830
I can't remember
when I've been so angry!

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.162
I'm a member of the press,
and I will not be intimidated

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:48.236
by you or anybody else!

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.866
- Now who's being melodramatic?
- You call this melodramatic?

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.942
- Wait till I get home!
- What are you going to do?

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:57.342
Faint or throw up. Maybe both.
I won't know till I get there.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.540
- Eight to five, it's throw up.
- You've got a bet!

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.783
Sir?

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:08.118
- Gutsy lady.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:12.719
- Great ass.
- I didn't notice, sir.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:17.729
Arthur, there's an old saying...
never bullshit a bullshitter.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:23.362
Yes, of course, sir.
Yes, a great ass, indeed.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.806
Can I get out now?

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:38.384
I don't think she has
such a great ass.

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:42.790
What do you expect me to do?

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:44.815
- Arrest him.
- On what charge?

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.895
- He had me kidnapped.
- Can you prove it?

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.462
Ask the taxi driver!

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.794
You said it was the taxi driver
who kidnapped you.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.390
Bruno's men forced him to.
They had guns!

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:57.199
- Did you see the guns?
- No, but the taxi driver...

01:12:57.306 --> 01:13:00.275
I'm certain that everything
you've told me is true,

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:04.005
but I'm equally certain
that Monsieur Langois will deny it.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.411
- Monsieur Langois?
- What it boils down to...

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:08.813
It boils down to
his word against mine!

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:09.884
Exactly!

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.475
And in certain circles,

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:14.522
Monsieur Langois'word
carries a lot of weight.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.853
You are upset,
so I will ignore the innuendo.

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.894
Upset or not,
the innuendo stands.

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:23.487
May I suggest that you go home
and forget all about this?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.594
Excuse me.

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.828
I shall tellyou
exactly where I'm going.

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:30.962
I'm going to my office,
where I shall write my next broadcast

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.041
about a Mafia boss
who kidnapped me

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:36.600
and the chief inspector of the Sûreté
who refused to do anything about it!

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:39.840
In my opinion,
that would be most unwise.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:44.544
What it boils down to, Inspector,
is I don't trust your opinion.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:59.033
Miss Jouvet seemed a bit upset.

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:02.661
Miss Jouvet is turning out
to be a real pain in the a...

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:07.237
<i>So far, the incident</i>
<i>hasn't even been investigated.</i>

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:10.505
<i>If Bruno Langois is in the mood</i>
<i>to deny the allegation,</i>

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:13.308
<i>I will be happy</i>
<i>to repeat it on the witness stand.</i>

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.848
She's talking about you.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.578
<i>It won't be the first time</i>
<i>that I've been instrumental...</i>

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:20.883
- Lot of guts.
<i>...to change his testimony.</i>

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.924
<i>I believe even the French</i>
<i>godfather would think twice</i>

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.256
<i>about challenging me in court.</i>

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:29.592
<i>As for chief Inspector Dreyfus,</i>

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:33.691
<i>if hereally is the paragon</i>
<i>of police virtue he purports to be,</i>

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:37.397
<i>why hasn't he bothered to find</i>
<i>the taxi driver and interrogate him?</i>

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:40.031
She's talking about you.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:45.741
It's intriguing, but the more
I find out about Clouseau,

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:48.282
the more
certain interested parties

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:51.147
would prefer that I drop
my investigation.

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:54.552
So far I haven't turned up
anything incriminating,

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:58.786
but obviously I'm rocking the boat
and people are getting nervous.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:01.863
One thing's sure...
I intend to keep on rocking

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.932
until I have an answer for you.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.363
Good night.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:19.370
<i>Inspector clouseau's residence,</i>

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:25.952
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:14.262
Avon calling!

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.347
You?

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.116
Regrettably.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.894
<i>Inspector clouseau's residence,</i>
<i>cato speaking.</i>

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.562
<i>I've gone to Miami Beach</i>

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.333

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.169
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:11.268
- I'm sorry.
- I'm used to it.

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:14.075
<i>This is Professor Auguste Balls</i>
<i>of Paris.</i>

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:18.448
<i>You Oriental picaroon, you can't</i>
<i>fool me about the plane crash.</i>

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:20.783
<i>He is hiding to avoid payment.</i>

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:25.121
<i>Unless I receive 4,000 francs</i>
<i>by Friday, I'm suing!</i>

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:27.388
<i>Put that in your opium pipe</i>
<i>and smoke it,</i>

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.487
<i>you conniving cantonese!</i>

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.329
Who the hell
is Professor Auguste Balls?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:37.303
Inspector Clouseau's
official disguise maker.

01:19:37.405 --> 01:19:39.236
- What's a picaroon?
- A cheat.

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:42.208
- That's great.
- Being called a cheat?

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.437
Some of my best friends
are picaroons.

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.474
I'm sorry I broke in.

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:50.210
That's okay.
Keeps me in practice.

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.286
Can I get you
a cup of tea or something?

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:55.413
- No, thanks.
- I could use an aspirin.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.583
I telephoned before,
and I really thought

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:00.661
you'd gone to visit
your grandmother in Miami.

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.162
Miami Beach.
She runs a bingo parlor.

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.062
She's a real picaroon!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.934
I thought maybe I'd find something.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.874
- Like what?
- Like this.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.945
Oh, that.

01:20:18.046 --> 01:20:20.014
Do you know who these people are?

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.878
His parents.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:25.316
- Are they still alive?
- His father is.

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:28.155
<i>He lives in</i>
<i>the château clouseau à Lamarque.</i>

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:29.689
<i>He's a winemaker.</i>

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.870
Swine rabbit.

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.391
My Chardonnay.

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:06.490
My Beaujolais.

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.735
He wants to try.

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.163
What are you doing?

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.468
It's good.

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:35.420
It doesn't taste the same
since we lost Fifi.

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.718
My missing grape Fifi.

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:42.555
Could you tell me something
about your son?

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:49.997
No. After 4:00...

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:54.707
I can't tellyou anything
about my son.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.834
Why not after 4:00?

01:21:56.945 --> 01:22:01.712
Because after tasting
the wine all day,

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:07.186
after 4:00,
I can't remember my son,

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:11.157
let alone tellyou
anything about him.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:18.222
It is a miracle
that I remember it is after 4:00.

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.547
That felt good.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:37.982
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:44.821
I was just checking
that Nanna vacuumed the rug.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.229
Speaking of Nanna...

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:55.863
Fetch Nanna.

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:05.012
Nanna has been with me
61 years.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.877
She was Jacques' nurse.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.076
- Oh, really?
- What?

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.211
I said, "really."

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.948
I know that.

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:17.957
Because you said Nanna
was your son's nurse.

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:22.223
Mademoiselle, you don't
have to repeat what I said.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.798
I know what I said.

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:30.963
Fortunately, I am not too old
to have lost my memory yet.

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.097
Knock wood.

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.079
Come in!

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:50.054
What am I laughing about?

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.456
I'm not sure I can explain it.

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.791
Nanna approaches.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.865
<i>A droite,</i> dog.

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:17.307
- <i>Santé!</i>
- <i>Santé.</i>

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:32.525
How she loves that dog.

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.390
<i>Regardez,</i> dog.

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:24.074
<i>My son Jacques clouseau</i>
<i>was born September 8, 1920.</i>

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:29.173
<i>He had his mother's eyes</i>
<i>and his father's kidneys.</i>

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:54.731
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:58.710
<i>Jacques wanted to be a policeman.</i>

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:07.816
<i>He had many setbacks...</i>

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.385
<i>...but he was always resourceful.</i>

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:21.495
<i>He was 18</i>
<i>when he entered the university</i>

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:24.231
<i>and fell in love.</i>

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:31.045
<i>The girl of his dreams</i>
<i>married another.</i>

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:38.246
<i>Jacques decided</i>
<i>that life was not worth living.</i>

01:27:58.306 --> 01:28:00.365
To whom it may concern...

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:06.676
I find life
no longer worth living.

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.007
<i>Fortunately...</i>

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:12.981
<i>...there was a power failure.</i>

01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:15.021
Swine lights.

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:33.196
<i>When the Germans invaded France,</i>

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:37.301
<i>Jacques joined the underground.</i>

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.054
Swine plunger.

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:07.759
After the war,
he joined the police force,

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.201
and the rest is history.

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:13.273
Thank you, Monsieur Clouseau.
It's been most interesting.

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:14.864
- It has?
- Yes.

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:17.536
It helps to round out my tribute.

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:19.613
What do you mean?

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:24.815
Your tribute doesn't need rounding.

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.387
You have a great-looking tribute.

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:33.788
- He's alive, you know.
- How do you know that?

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:38.093
He has his mother's eyes
but his father's fortitude.

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:40.997
- I thought it was his kidneys.
- That, too.

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:43.969
A man with such fortitude
and kidneys

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:46.505
must be alive someplace.

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.474
- I hope so.
- I knew that.

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:08.492
And so, after leaving
that delightful old man,

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:11.895
who is so firmly convinced
that his famous son is still alive,

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:14.593
I began to wonder...
is it possible?

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:18.035
Mafia boss Bruno Langois
seems to think it is.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:21.597
Sir Charles Litton feels
that such men are indispensable

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:23.700
and therefore indestructible.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:27.713
Chief Inspector Dreyfus
is so obsessed with the possibility

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:30.943
that he's on the verge
of another nervous breakdown.

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:35.512
Did Inspector Clouseau
really perish in the sea as reported,

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:38.854
or, for reasons as yet unknown,

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.293
is he out there someplace
plotting his next move,

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:45.627
waiting to reveal himself
when the time is right?

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:48.201
I am reluctant
to believe that misfortune

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:51.271
has really struck down
such a great man.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.741
Swine seagull.

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:20.329
We must find that woman.

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.669
Here's the report.

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:30.903
I will apprehend this culprit
within 24 hours.

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.815
Now we are getting somewhere.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:36.539
You...

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.449
That's a priceless Steinway!

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:46.026
Not anymore.

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:19.492
Inspector Clouseau's residence.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.028
- <i>clouseau?</i>
- One moment, please.

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:24.158
For you.

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:46.586
He is Sir Charles Phantom,
the notorious Litton.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:49.155
- The Phantom.
- One and the same.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.021
My greedy little yellow pimp.

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:55.996
There is something that I am
very interested to know.

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:57.564
This room looks very...

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.943
Back to town!

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:20.511
Follow that car!

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:36.403
Does your dog bite?

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.276
Nice doggy.

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:49.039
I thought you said
your dog did not bite.

01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.641
That is not my dog.

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:56.883
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the Palace Hotel?

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.151
Yes.

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.956
Special delivery.
A bomb.

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:04.122
Were you expecting one?

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:06.428
A bomb?!

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:24.279
You fool!
You raving orient idiot!

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.979
There is a time
and a place for everything, Cato!

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:29.989
And this is it.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.334
And another thing!

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:47.533
I was known as the Pavlova
of the parallels.

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:54.243
Yes, it's all coming back now.

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:58.079
I remember it.

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:09.759
That felt good.
