(music on TV)

00:57.800 --> 00:59.767
Hi, ma. What you watching?

00:59.834 --> 01:02.333
I don't know. One of those
Steven Spielberger movies.

01:04.133 --> 01:07.667
That's not a Steven Spielberg movie.
What are they doing?

01:09.600 --> 01:12.300
You know what they're doing.
We had that talk when you were 12.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.133
Ma, I can't believe this.
You rented a dirty movie?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.867
Dirty is in the eye of the beholder.

01:20.033 --> 01:21.867
Ok, maybe that's a little dirty.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.066
I cannot watch more of this.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.133
Hi.

01:27.266 --> 01:29.133
Wrong button. That's fast-forward.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.533
Oh, my! What are they doing?

01:34.367 --> 01:37.567
I know what they're doing, but I never saw
anybody do it at that speed.

01:41.567 --> 01:44.567
It reminds me
of my uncle Ricky's rabbit farm.

01:46.033 --> 01:49.533
-That's reverse, Dorothy.
-I did that once.

01:53.433 --> 01:55.066
It was his birthday.

01:57.133 --> 02:01.967
Ugh. Ma, we did not get a VCR
so that you could watch dirty movies.

02:02.033 --> 02:03.900
I'm 81. What are you worrying about?

02:03.967 --> 02:06.533
You think I'm gonna find someone
at the center to do that with?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.967
-When's your friend Jean coming?
-Oh, she called.

02:10.033 --> 02:11.300
She's on her way from the airport.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.000
Oh, I hope she has
a good time while she's here.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.233
I remember how tough it was for me the
first year after Charlie died.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.467
Yeah, well,
she's getting better every day.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.367
How long were Jean and Pat married?

02:21.433 --> 02:24.100
Oh, they were together about eight years.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.133
Oh, poor thing. Wish there was
something I could do.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.233
I know!

02:29.300 --> 02:32.133
I'll make my famous
ice cream clown sundaes

02:32.200 --> 02:35.166
with little raisin eyes
and the sugar cone caps.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.066
If that doesn't fill the void,
nothing will.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.400
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Nothing.

02:44.367 --> 02:47.967
I'm a little nervous about Jean.
I mean, she's a very special person.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.567
I don't know if she's gonna
get along with Blanche and Rose.

02:50.633 --> 02:52.133
You mean because she's a lesbian?

02:52.667 --> 02:56.467
Ma! She's not a lesbian!
I mean, what an absurd thing...

02:56.533 --> 02:57.767
how did you know?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.467
I've known since you two were
in college together.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.633
She didn't even know in college.

03:04.467 --> 03:07.066
-How did you know?
-A mother knows.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.433
Do you think I should tell Rose
and Blanche?

03:11.333 --> 03:12.600
Jean is a nice person.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.433
She happens to like girls,
instead of guys.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.133
Some people like cats instead of dogs.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.533
Frankly, I'd rather live with a lesbian
than a cat.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.600
Unless a lesbian sheds, that I don't know.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.600
(doorbell rings)

03:35.100 --> 03:36.667
-Jean.
-Dorothy!

03:36.734 --> 03:42.900
-Oh, honey, it is so good to see you.
-Sophia! You haven't aged a bit.

03:42.967 --> 03:44.166
You look great.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.600
Oh, Jean, you were always
a terrific girl.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.600
Dorothy, why can't you be
more like Jean?

03:50.367 --> 03:51.367
Scratch that.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.266
Where are your roommates, Dorothy?

03:54.333 --> 03:57.800
Uh, Jean, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

03:57.867 --> 04:01.567
-I don't know quite how to phrase this.
-The lesbian thing...

04:01.633 --> 04:03.367
do you keep it under your hat or what?

04:05.166 --> 04:07.500
Ma. Jean, do you?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.767
I mean... you know, what I mean--

04:09.834 --> 04:12.033
I know what you mean.
You didn't tell your roommates

04:12.100 --> 04:13.633
that Pat was a woman, did you?

04:13.700 --> 04:15.834
Well, they just assumed
that Pat was your husband.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.000
And I wanted to make sure
it was ok with you before I told them.

04:19.066 --> 04:22.934
Well, listen, Dorothy, I'm not embarrassed
or ashamed of who I am.

04:23.233 --> 04:25.100
You know your friends better than I do.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.200
If you think they're the kind of people
who can handle it,

04:27.266 --> 04:29.033
I'd prefer to tell them.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.433
Here we are.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.900
Ice cream clowns with sugar-cone hats
for everybody.

04:34.867 --> 04:36.266
It'll be our little secret.

04:39.266 --> 04:41.767
Hi. You must be Jean. I'm Rose.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.834
-Nice to meet you, Rose.
-Ice cream clown sundae?

04:44.900 --> 04:47.333
Oh, Rose, Jean is gonna be
with us for a week.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.800
Let's not have all the really big fun
right away.

04:51.967 --> 04:55.367
-Oh! Hello, there.
-Ah, Blanche, this is my friend Jean.

04:55.433 --> 04:58.967
-Oh, I'm glad to finally meet you, Jean.
-You too, Blanche.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.433
Dorothy has told us so much about you,
I feel like we're <i>Bosom Buddies.</i>

05:02.500 --> 05:03.667
Ma, not a word.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.233
We're gonna have so much fun.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.000
I know where to find the best restaurants,
the best nightclubs,

05:10.066 --> 05:12.100
-the best men.
-Uh, Blanche...

05:12.900 --> 05:15.533
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that insensitive of me?

05:15.600 --> 05:18.767
-Maybe you're not ready for men yet.
-You don't know the half of it.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.500
Jean, why don't we put
your suitcase in ma's room.

05:23.567 --> 05:26.700
-Ma is gonna sleep with me.
-Oh, you wouldn't mind, Sophia?

05:26.767 --> 05:29.667
No problem. I just have to remember
when I get up at night

05:29.734 --> 05:32.266
the bathroom is down the hall,
to my left, not my right.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.400
The last time we had a guest,
I killed two potted palms.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.533
So tell me, what do you have planned
today, Jean?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.867
Mmm, nothing special.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.734
Jean, forgive me if I'm dwelling
on the subject of men,

05:54.800 --> 05:58.233
but don't you think it's about time you
planned something special,

05:58.300 --> 05:59.734
if you know what I mean?

06:00.367 --> 06:01.767
Oh, I couldn't.

06:01.834 --> 06:04.567
Oh, come on, it's been a year.
Of course, you could.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.633
Believe her, Blanche. She couldn't.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.367
I know just how you feel.

06:09.433 --> 06:12.834
I couldn't even think of another man
for years after my husband died.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.567
That's exactly why you have
bad muscle tone.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.633
-Let me know if you change your mind.
-Mm-hmm.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.400
I haven't eaten a big breakfast like this
since I left the farm.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.767
Really? You were raised on a farm?

06:29.834 --> 06:32.367
Mm-hmm. Until I was 17.
A dairy farm.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.166
Wow! A dairy farm? Just like me!

06:36.467 --> 06:38.700
Oh! Oh, did you hear that?

06:38.767 --> 06:41.367
Jean was raised on a dairy farm!
I didn't know that.

06:41.433 --> 06:44.834
Why didn't you tell me
Jean was raised on a dairy farm?

06:45.300 --> 06:48.367
I was afraid it might be
too much the excitement for you.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.734
Did you have to help with the milking?

06:51.800 --> 06:54.800
Oh, yes! Until my father
got a milking machine.

06:54.867 --> 06:55.867
Oh, thank goodness

06:55.934 --> 06:59.000
-for the milking machine.
-Difficult as it is to tear myself away,

06:59.066 --> 07:02.500
-I really have to go.
-Yes, me too.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.433
I don't have to be in till late today.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.567
Would you feel like going
to an early matinee?

07:06.633 --> 07:08.033
Oh, that sounds great!

07:08.100 --> 07:10.800
I remember when we first got
our milking machine.

07:10.867 --> 07:13.300
I hooked Molly up to it,
flipped the switch

07:13.367 --> 07:16.867
-and she dropped like a rock.
-Ohh...

07:16.934 --> 07:18.433
Oh, well, luckily
she wasn't electrocuted.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.367
I mean, after that
she was no good for milking.

07:22.033 --> 07:26.133
But she certainly became the most popular
cow during mating season.

07:34.533 --> 07:37.867
-(thunder rolls)
-Oh, I do love the rain so.

07:38.734 --> 07:43.500
-It reminds me of my first kiss.
-Oh, your first kiss was in the rain.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.233
No. It was in the shower.

07:51.567 --> 07:54.800
Sophia, honey, where have you been?
I thought you were taking a nap.

07:54.867 --> 07:58.667
-I went to the video store.
-Ma, I told you I'd go.

07:58.734 --> 08:02.533
Forget it. The last time you brought back
<i>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.</i>

08:02.800 --> 08:05.266
You know how disappointed I was
to find out it's a musical?

08:10.066 --> 08:12.200
So Jean and Rose aren't back yet?

08:12.266 --> 08:14.600
No, they're probably having
lunch together again.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.000
They certainly have hit it off,
haven't they?

08:17.066 --> 08:20.100
I'm so glad.
Jean's really such a lovely person.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.800
Oh, yes. She is lovely.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.734
Dorothy, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way, but...

08:28.900 --> 08:31.367
there's something about Jean that bothers
me.

08:31.433 --> 08:33.300
-Bothers you?
-Mm-hmm.

08:33.367 --> 08:37.900
Every time I suggest she go out on a date,
the two of you change the subject.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.066
Oh, come on, Blanche. That's ridiculous.

08:40.133 --> 08:42.433
Look. I think the rain
is beginning to let up.

08:44.433 --> 08:48.767
Dorothy, I may be a lot of things,
but naive is not one of them.

08:49.433 --> 08:50.433
Face it...

08:50.867 --> 08:52.200
your friend Jean...

08:52.667 --> 08:54.300
is seeing a married man.

08:58.367 --> 09:01.000
Blanche, that is absolutely uncanny.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.200
I wasn't born yesterday.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.767
(crying)

09:06.834 --> 09:09.934
-Oh! It's ok.
-Oh, my God! What happened?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.367
-Oh, don't worry. She'll be fine.
-Of course you will, honey.

09:13.433 --> 09:16.867
That phony hair color won't come out
just 'cause you got caught in the rain.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.467
It's not that.

09:20.533 --> 09:24.100
We saw <i>Love Story</i>
and <i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

09:24.367 --> 09:27.367
It was the "cry me a river" matinee
at the Rialto.

09:29.066 --> 09:32.867
I'll be back. I'm going to change,
then I'll make us some tea. (crying)

09:34.767 --> 09:37.900
Blanche, would you mind if I spoke to
Dorothy privately a few minutes?

09:37.967 --> 09:40.433
Mind? Why, of course not.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.967
And listen, don't you worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.767
Um, Dorothy...

09:50.133 --> 09:52.200
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to leave today.

09:52.266 --> 09:56.100
-Because of Blanche? Honey, believe me--
-No. It has nothing to do with Blanche.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.400
You know something unexpected has come up.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.333
Back home? Is it serious?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.333
It's not back home, but it is serious.

10:04.467 --> 10:08.667
I haven't met anyone
as good and decent as Rose

10:08.734 --> 10:10.333
since Pat died...

10:11.800 --> 10:13.467
and I think I'm falling in love.

10:38.233 --> 10:40.800
Not tonight, Salvador.
I've been cooking all day.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.533
Ma, it's me. It's Dorothy.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.033
Oh, Dorothy.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.533
The way your elbow was poking me,

10:50.600 --> 10:52.700
I thought it was your father
sneaking up on me.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.000
I'm sorry, ma.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.600
Go back to sleep.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.567
-Ma...
-Is it morning already?

11:07.633 --> 11:08.667
No.

11:09.266 --> 11:11.767
-I just wanted to ask you a question.
-What?

11:13.200 --> 11:17.900
How would you react if you were told
that one of your kids was gay?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.500
Your brother, Phil, is gay?
I knew it.

11:20.567 --> 11:23.467
When he was a kid, we couldn't keep him
away from those gladiator movies.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.734
-Ma, Phil is not gay.
-You mean you're gay?

11:27.800 --> 11:30.867
What, your friend Jean is having some sort
of membership drive?

11:32.266 --> 11:33.767
-Ma...
-Dorothy,

11:33.834 --> 11:37.066
I know you don't get many dates,
but stick with what you know.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.867
(sighs)

11:40.934 --> 11:43.700
At your age, it's very hard
to break into something new.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.700
-Good night.
-Ma, ma. I am not gay.

11:47.767 --> 11:50.100
I just wanted to get your reaction.

11:51.767 --> 11:55.300
I'll tell you the truth, Dorothy.
If one of my kids was gay...

11:55.834 --> 11:57.967
I wouldn't love him one bit less.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.867
I would wish him all the happiness
in the world.

12:01.367 --> 12:04.133
It's because you're the greatest mother
in the world.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.266
And I love you.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.767
Fine.

12:09.567 --> 12:12.033
Now keep your fat mouth shut
so I can get some sleep.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.633
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.367
(snickers)

12:28.333 --> 12:30.100
(laughs)

12:30.367 --> 12:34.400
-Ma, come on. It's not funny.
-The hell it's not.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.133
Jean in love with little Miss Muffet?
Come on.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.734
(both laughing)

12:41.800 --> 12:43.166
What is going on?

12:43.233 --> 12:44.233
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.867
Oh, come on now. I heard you laughing.
What's so funny?

12:48.934 --> 12:51.133
-For starters, Jean is a lesbian.
-Ma.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.066
What's funny about that?

12:55.467 --> 12:58.066
-You aren't surprised?
-Of course not.

12:58.133 --> 13:00.467
I mean, I've never known
any personally, but...

13:00.834 --> 13:02.367
isn't Danny Thomas one?

13:12.200 --> 13:15.033
Not Lebanese, Blanche.

13:16.367 --> 13:17.433
Lesbian.

13:17.867 --> 13:18.867
Lesbian.

13:19.767 --> 13:20.834
Lesbian...

13:22.333 --> 13:23.467
lesbian?

13:25.400 --> 13:27.633
Well, isn't that where one woman
and another--

13:27.700 --> 13:30.166
We already know what it means.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.967
But Jean's a very attractive woman,
she could have any man she wants.

13:34.033 --> 13:36.567
-She doesn't want them.
-Well, why not?

13:37.033 --> 13:40.533
A man has so much more to offer.
You know what I mean, Dorothy?

13:41.066 --> 13:43.367
Yeah. I found that out when Mark Perper

13:43.433 --> 13:45.967
was running for class president
in the third grade.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.934
Why? What does that
have to do with anything?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.333
Well, his campaign slogan was,

13:49.400 --> 13:51.266
"vote for me,
and I'll show you my wee wee."

14:00.734 --> 14:02.433
He won by a landslide.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.467
Well... I'll never understand

14:06.533 --> 14:08.533
what Jean doesn't see
in the opposite sex,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.066
but, hey, if that's what makes her happy,
that's fine by me.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.533
There's one other thing.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.800
Jean thinks she's in love with Rose.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
Rose?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.500
Jean has the hots for Rose?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.133
I don't believe it.
I do not believe it!

14:24.200 --> 14:26.900
-I was pretty surprised myself.
-Well, I'll bet.

14:27.467 --> 14:31.233
To think Jean would prefer Rose over me?
That's ridiculous!

14:35.100 --> 14:36.734
Blanche, please.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.934
Now, you tell me the truth,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.333
if you had to pick between me and Rose,
who would you pick?

14:40.867 --> 14:42.800
Blanche, pull yourself together!

14:44.633 --> 14:47.133
Oh... I'm sorry.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.066
-Does Rose know?
-No.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.133
Oh, good.
I don't think you oughta tell her.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.734
After all, she's not as worldly and
sophisticated about these things as I am.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.200
Absolutely, if she finds out
Danny Thomas is a lesbian

15:03.266 --> 15:04.667
it will break her heart.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.467
Ah-ah-choo!

15:18.533 --> 15:19.600
-Bless you.
-Bless you.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.367
Stop blessing her.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.767
She got what she deserved

15:22.834 --> 15:25.367
for running around in the rain
for some dirty movies.

15:27.934 --> 15:29.066
I'm going to bed.

15:29.133 --> 15:31.133
Me, too. I think I'll call it a night.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.967
Dorothy, do you really think you oughta
sleep in the same bed as Sophia?

15:34.033 --> 15:36.300
-You could get that cold.
-You know, you're right, Blanche.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.333
Ma, you sleep in your room.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.200
Jean can sleep in my room tonight.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.934
You're letting a sick old woman sleep
in her own bed?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.333
With her own pillow?
Bless you, warden.

15:47.767 --> 15:50.300
I wouldn't mind
sleeping here on the sofa.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.734
That lumpy thing?
No, you're sleeping in my room.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.800
-Thanks.
-I think I'll retire, too.

15:54.867 --> 15:57.700
This is the night I do facial packs
and compresses.

15:58.266 --> 15:59.333
It takes me an hour,

15:59.400 --> 16:02.467
but that's why my skin's as smooth
as a baby's bottom.

16:03.967 --> 16:08.300
That must explain the urge I sometimes
have to diaper your head.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.033
You feel like playing
a few more hands?

16:13.100 --> 16:16.967
Sure. Oh, staying up
like this, playing games,

16:17.033 --> 16:19.266
reminds me of my
teenage slumber parties.

16:19.333 --> 16:23.133
Oh, God. Oh, I'll never forget
my first slumber party.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.233
We all get sent home for fighting over
who had the cutest date for the prom.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.633
-I never got to go to the prom.
-You're kidding. Why?

16:32.066 --> 16:35.000
Well, I really wanted to go
with Delbert Twitchell,

16:35.066 --> 16:37.300
he was the most gorgeous boy
at our school.

16:37.834 --> 16:41.066
And he was captain of the precision
combine drill team.

16:42.533 --> 16:45.700
Well, actually, I was so sure Delbert
was gonna to ask me,

16:45.767 --> 16:48.967
that I turned down our only
foreign exchange student,

16:49.033 --> 16:50.166
Cyril Mountbatten.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.200
Well, daddy didn't like Cyril anyway
'cause he was British.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.000
Daddy said the relationship
would never work out

16:56.066 --> 16:57.934
on account of the language barrier.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.000
Daddy was a caring and ignorant man.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.600
Well, finally, it got to the day
before the prom,

17:07.667 --> 17:09.533
and Delbert still hadn't asked me.

17:09.600 --> 17:14.767
So I marched across a crowded cafeteria,
stared him straight in the eye,

17:14.834 --> 17:17.467
and said, "Delbert, what gives?"

17:18.834 --> 17:21.467
He said, "Jenny McCoy,
that's why I'm taking her to the prom."

17:31.467 --> 17:34.734
It was the first year after Charlie died
that was hardest.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.100
I'd lie awake for hours.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.600
I just could not get
used to sleeping alone.

17:40.367 --> 17:43.900
Then I started taking the extra pillows
and shoving them under the covers,

17:43.967 --> 17:45.500
so I'd be lying next to them.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.467
Oh, it didn't really feel like Charlie,

17:48.533 --> 17:50.367
but sometimes
it helped me fall asleep.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.834
I'll have to try that.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.600
It can't be 2:00.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.867
It is.
Oh, I'd better let you get some sleep.

17:59.934 --> 18:01.867
-Good night, Rose.
-Good night.

18:01.934 --> 18:03.200
Oh, Jean.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.800
Listen, with it this late,
I hate to have you to wake Dorothy.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.433
Why don't you stay in my room tonight?

18:07.500 --> 18:11.500
Oh, well, I suppose that makes more sense
than waking Dorothy.

18:11.567 --> 18:14.934
Good. By the way, you're not a cover hog,
are you?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.600
-No.
-Good, 'cause I am.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.633
Rose... are you awake?

18:34.700 --> 18:35.700
Rose?

18:37.033 --> 18:41.233
-Am I hogging the covers?
-Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.433
Rose, I want to tell you something.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.467
If I don't say it,
I'll never get to sleep.

18:47.934 --> 18:48.934
What?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.200
I like you very much, Rose.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.700
I like you, too, Jean.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.800
I think you're very special.

18:57.934 --> 19:00.000
I think you're special, too.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.233
What I really want to say is, I...

19:08.333 --> 19:10.333
I'm quite fond of you.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.400
I'm fond of you, too.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.367
(snoring)

19:50.567 --> 19:51.700
Good morning, Dorothy.

19:51.767 --> 19:54.166
Oh, morning, Blanche.
Have you seen Jean?

19:54.233 --> 19:56.567
-No.
-I wonder where she could be.

19:56.633 --> 19:59.166
Didn't she say where she was going
when you all got up this morning?

19:59.233 --> 20:00.700
She never came to bed.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.367
Maybe she stayed in Sophia's room.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.400
Ma, did Jean sleep with you last night?

20:05.467 --> 20:08.734
Dorothy, there are a lot of things
I want to try before I die.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.667
But that's not one of them.

20:18.266 --> 20:19.934
Then she must have stayed
in Rose's room.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.333
My God. Dorothy, you don't suppose
Jean would ever, you know...

20:23.667 --> 20:24.667
Listen, Blanche.

20:24.734 --> 20:27.033
I do not believe anything
for one moment

20:27.100 --> 20:28.834
that anything other than gin rummy

20:28.900 --> 20:31.033
happened between Rose
and Jean last night.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.633
-Dorothy, something terrible happened.
-Oh, God.

20:35.834 --> 20:39.100
You idiot. If somebody told you
to jump off a bridge, would you do it?

20:39.700 --> 20:43.000
Sophia, Blanche, would you excuse us?

20:43.066 --> 20:45.100
You mean you don't wanna talk to me, too?

20:45.166 --> 20:47.934
Oh, thanks, Blanche, but it really
involves Dorothy's friend.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.166
We're going, we're going.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.567
Ok, Rose. What is it?

21:06.200 --> 21:07.400
It's about Jean.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.100
What about Jean?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.266
Well, I don't wanna shock you, Dorothy,
but Jean--

21:12.333 --> 21:15.467
I know. Jean is gay.

21:15.533 --> 21:18.500
You know already?
What about Blanche?

21:18.567 --> 21:19.967
No. Blanche is not gay.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.967
I don't mean that.
I mean, she knows?

21:24.300 --> 21:25.367
And ma.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.633
You told everybody but me?

21:27.700 --> 21:31.433
Honey, I didn't even know if you'd know
what a lesbian was.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.433
I could have looked it up.

21:35.367 --> 21:37.967
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I thought I was doing the right thing.

21:38.033 --> 21:40.367
I guess I underestimated you.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.934
Well, that's not important.
I've got a bigger problem.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.033
I like Jean. I like her a lot.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.934
But... I think she's in love with me.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.266
She told you?

21:51.567 --> 21:56.100
Well, not in so many words,
but... I knew what she meant.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.734
Unless I'm wrong, Dorothy.
Now, you know I'm wrong

21:58.800 --> 22:01.667
-about so many things.
-No, honey. You're not wrong about this.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.133
Dorothy, what am I gonna do?

22:04.433 --> 22:06.400
Oh, Dorothy, I... oh, oh...

22:06.467 --> 22:07.500
-Oh. Hi, Rose.
-Hey.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.967
What's with the suitcase?

22:09.033 --> 22:11.834
-I thought you were--
-I decided I do have to go.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.300
-But you were going to stay--
-Dorothy...

22:14.233 --> 22:16.934
would you mind if I spoke with Jean
for a minute?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.867
No. Fine. Go ahead.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.500
I'm going, I'm going.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.166
Want a cup of coffee?

22:33.233 --> 22:35.834
-Maybe I will have a cup of coffee.
-Oh, good.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.867
Rose, about last night...
I should never have said anything.

22:41.934 --> 22:43.934
You only said what you were feeling.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.266
Well, it's just that...

22:45.633 --> 22:48.567
this last year has been so difficult
for me.

22:49.133 --> 22:53.133
See, Pat was the person that I planned
to spend the rest of my life with...

22:53.867 --> 22:55.166
and when she died...

22:55.567 --> 22:57.767
I just felt so terribly alone...

22:58.433 --> 22:59.433
empty.

22:59.867 --> 23:02.834
I thought I could never
care for anyone again...

23:03.700 --> 23:04.700
until I met you.

23:05.567 --> 23:08.433
I just got very confused.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.900
I hope I didn't make you
feel uncomfortable.

23:12.300 --> 23:16.633
Well, I have to admit, I don't understand
these kinds of feelings...

23:17.867 --> 23:20.867
but if I did understand,
and if I were...

23:21.567 --> 23:23.700
you know, like you...

23:24.667 --> 23:28.467
I think I'd be very flattered and proud
that you thought of me that way.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.667
Thank you, Rose.

23:31.533 --> 23:33.433
Well, I guess that's all I had to say.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.333
Except you don't have to go.

23:36.133 --> 23:39.133
Unless you think
our friendship alone isn't enough.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.600
It's enough.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.200
-Oh...
-(both chuckle)

23:48.000 --> 23:50.200
This isn't what it looks like.

23:50.266 --> 23:52.333
I know, I know.
I was listening at the door.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.300
Why were you listening at the door?

23:57.367 --> 23:59.533
Because I'm not tall enough
to see through the window.

24:13.066 --> 24:16.567
(theme music playing)
