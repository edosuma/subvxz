<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.513 --> 00:03.819
Adam wanted me to give you this.

00:04.522 --> 00:05.592
It's a ring.

00:05.725 --> 00:07.040
That's a beautiful stone.

00:08.196 --> 00:09.116
I'll be back for that.

00:10.128 --> 00:11.034
It's not in there, kid.

00:11.587 --> 00:12.452
Your ring?

00:12.852 --> 00:14.121
- I sold it.
- Who bought it?

00:14.695 --> 00:16.404
Welcome to Madacorp.

00:18.495 --> 00:20.975
I think I made a mistake
bringing Jessi to you.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.482
I think it's vital
that she continue coming.

00:23.602 --> 00:25.557
In fact, if Jessi misses
even one appointment,

00:25.677 --> 00:27.853
I won't hesitate
to call Social Services.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.340
'Cause I like you. Don't you like me?

00:31.025 --> 00:32.389
Well, yeah.

00:32.891 --> 00:34.320
Let's count to 3

00:34.753 --> 00:36.976
and both say what's on
our minds at the same time.

00:37.476 --> 00:38.694
- I like you.
- I have cancer.

00:39.075 --> 00:39.771
What?

00:45.507 --> 00:46.945
<i>ZZYZX. That's the way in.</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:50.065
<i>When we were down there...</i>

00:51.582 --> 00:52.611
<i>I saw things.</i>

00:53.797 --> 00:56.205
<i>This was Baylin's. Can't get it open.</i>

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:19.863 --> 01:21.361
<i>Locks can play secrets.</i>

01:22.127 --> 01:23.523
<i>The stronger the lock,</i>

01:23.767 --> 01:24.990
<i>the bigger the secret.</i>

01:26.158 --> 01:27.611
<i>Adam Baylin's secrets are locked</i>

01:27.731 --> 01:28.949
<i>inside this box.</i>

01:29.697 --> 01:32.348
<i>The secrets of ZZYZX are
locked inside my head.</i>

01:35.311 --> 01:36.787
<i>But what could be so important to</i>

01:36.907 --> 01:39.482
<i>make me lock them away
and keep them a secret from myself?</i>

01:42.062 --> 01:44.824
<i>I guess sometimes the only
thing more elusive than secrets</i>

01:45.409 --> 01:46.957
<i>is the key to unlocking them.</i>

01:48.771 --> 01:49.903
<i>In this case,</i>

01:50.519 --> 01:52.400
<i>the key was the ring that Adam gave me:</i>

01:53.681 --> 01:55.296
<i>the ring I no longer had.</i>

01:58.120 --> 01:59.695
I just don't understand

01:59.846 --> 02:02.602
what's so important
that's locked inside Kyle's head.

02:02.864 --> 02:05.187
Everything that ZZYZX
was able to feed him...

02:05.925 --> 02:09.136
that is, before you could
fit their remains in an ashtray.

02:10.482 --> 02:12.406
How did your trip
with Stephen Trager go?

02:13.948 --> 02:15.037
It went well.

02:15.861 --> 02:18.958
He opened up about his dead father.
I'd say we bonded.

02:20.138 --> 02:22.170
And how are things
with Nicole since your...

02:22.814 --> 02:23.968
altercation?

02:25.182 --> 02:26.348
We'll find out.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.430
She has another session
with Jessi in a couple of days.

02:31.178 --> 02:32.609
We need to speed things up.

02:42.219 --> 02:45.455
Drop the spoon and back away
from the stove,

02:45.606 --> 02:46.619
nice and easy.

02:46.739 --> 02:49.824
Come on, I'm starving. It's your fault
this stuff smells so good.

02:49.973 --> 02:52.204
I think there was
a compliment in there somewhere.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.073
Pasta, most delicious of all

02:55.193 --> 02:56.778
carb delivery systems.

02:56.929 --> 02:58.726
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.

02:59.042 --> 03:02.064
- How old?
- Oh, about 53 minutes.

03:02.666 --> 03:06.332
Oh, I need you to set an extra place
at the table. Amanda is joing us.

03:06.598 --> 03:07.917
Did Kyle invite her?

03:08.068 --> 03:09.663
Yes, and he's very excited

03:09.793 --> 03:12.209
and whatever the Kyle version
of nervous is.

03:12.373 --> 03:14.290
Great. Kyle has a date.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.729
Bye-bye, leftovers.

03:15.892 --> 03:17.137
Josh, this is important to him.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.161
Hey, Josh, why don't you
invite Andy over for dinner?

03:23.215 --> 03:25.945
What, no smart-ass reply?
What's next, locusts?

03:27.284 --> 03:28.391
Hey, guys.

03:29.394 --> 03:32.330
We have a guest for dinner.
This is my boss, Julian Ballantine.

03:32.788 --> 03:34.112
Sorry to spring this on you.

03:35.317 --> 03:36.490
Didn't get a chance to call.

03:36.913 --> 03:38.408
Don't be silly. It's so nice to

03:38.528 --> 03:39.976
finally meet you, Mr. Ballantine.

03:40.641 --> 03:41.829
Bye-bye, seconds.

03:41.964 --> 03:43.194
This is Josh

03:43.410 --> 03:44.915
and Lori.

03:45.149 --> 03:47.526
Good to meet you,
and please call me Julian.

03:48.673 --> 03:52.047
I brought... red and white.

03:52.683 --> 03:54.712
- Didn't know what you'd be serving.
- I like red.

03:55.792 --> 03:56.927
I mean...

03:57.183 --> 03:59.104
I mean, I will when I'm 21.

04:01.558 --> 04:03.475
I heard the door. Is Amanda...

04:04.198 --> 04:06.056
Oh, you must be Kyle.

04:06.718 --> 04:08.415
I heard so much about you from Stephen.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.346
We work together at Madacorp.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.146
Excuse me.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.646
You have to forgive Kyle.
Tonight's kind of a date.

04:31.586 --> 04:32.754
You look beautiful.

04:33.581 --> 04:35.142
I didn't know what to wear.

04:35.374 --> 04:38.385
I wasn't sure how fancy
it would be or not, so I...

04:38.643 --> 04:41.162
You wear what you were
wearing the first time I saw you,

04:41.758 --> 04:43.079
when you were playing the piano.

04:44.424 --> 04:45.875
I had no idea I...

04:47.350 --> 04:49.098
Wait, how could you even remember that?

04:49.614 --> 04:50.695
How could I forget it?

04:53.242 --> 04:54.623
Well, I almost forgot.

04:54.819 --> 04:56.820
There's this concert at Seattle Phil.

04:57.748 --> 04:59.406
They're playing Pachelbel's works and...

04:59.718 --> 05:00.532
I'd love to.

05:02.292 --> 05:03.630
Go with you, I mean.

05:06.297 --> 05:08.874
<i>Yes. That's good, that's good.
Oh, please.</i>

05:13.645 --> 05:15.046
I almost brought champagne,

05:15.225 --> 05:17.466
but I figured I'd save it
till after the test this week.

05:17.863 --> 05:20.129
- What test?
- It's a systems integration test.

05:20.847 --> 05:23.755
We bring all the software and hardware
online together at the same time.

05:23.893 --> 05:25.369
We synch it all up to the mainframe

05:25.544 --> 05:27.731
and evaluate
the biometric signature compatibility.

05:28.013 --> 05:30.394
So you're turning neural
impulses into computer data.

05:32.074 --> 05:34.107
Sounds you understand
this stuff better than I do.

05:34.498 --> 05:36.776
You know, maybe I should
have served dinner with a manual.

05:39.241 --> 05:41.580
I don't know what I did
before we had Stephen around,

05:41.860 --> 05:42.949
after this week, I promise

05:43.069 --> 05:45.702
I won't keep him away from you
any more than absolutely necessary.

05:47.699 --> 05:49.744
I figured Emily can
handle the next trip solo.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.373
Emily went with you last weekend?

05:53.055 --> 05:54.461
Yeah. She's part of the project.

05:57.271 --> 05:59.174
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.

05:59.447 --> 06:00.461
To Stephen

06:00.730 --> 06:02.360
and your wonderful family,

06:03.506 --> 06:05.854
whom I hope I get to know
much better in the future.

06:07.310 --> 06:08.713
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:32.001 --> 06:34.671
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 10:
House of Cards</font>

06:36.562 --> 06:37.656
Baylin's ring?

06:37.862 --> 06:40.585
Yeah. I saw it right there
on Ballantine's finger.

06:41.749 --> 06:42.780
What do you think?

06:44.632 --> 06:47.188
The man who just
happens to be Stephen's boss

06:47.334 --> 06:49.843
also just happens
to be in possession of a ring...

06:49.999 --> 06:51.476
Baylin's ring... that you pawned.

06:52.227 --> 06:53.229
A ring that

06:53.405 --> 06:54.583
just so happens to be

06:54.713 --> 06:56.928
the only way
of opening Baylin's box that you

06:57.238 --> 06:59.764
happened to dig up out
of that underground death trap.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.350
What do I think? I think there's
no such thing as coincidence.

07:04.146 --> 07:06.032
I need to talk to Foss about this.

07:06.815 --> 07:08.348
Baylin told you not to trust him.

07:08.774 --> 07:10.411
Baylin told me not to trust Taylor.

07:10.714 --> 07:12.304
I think Taylor switched the message.

07:12.664 --> 07:13.730
Whatever.

07:14.045 --> 07:16.335
You can't just sit back
and wait for Foss' blessing.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.872
Amanda, it's Kyle.

07:21.002 --> 07:23.690
He's gonna be thrilled
no matter what you wear.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.181
Trust me, if I wear something lame,
he'll remember it.

07:28.675 --> 07:29.795
What's the matter?

07:32.329 --> 07:34.521
I got a letter from
this conservatory in New York.

07:34.937 --> 07:37.439
I applied there a long
time ago to study piano.

07:38.981 --> 07:40.066
And I kind of got in.

07:40.284 --> 07:41.827
That's awesome.

07:42.772 --> 07:44.355
I'd kill to get to go to New York.

07:44.525 --> 07:46.343
I'm totally excited. It's just...

07:47.433 --> 07:48.742
It's for a whole semester,

07:48.867 --> 07:50.702
- and...
- The long-distance thing.

07:52.601 --> 07:54.910
- It explains your attention to detail.
- Yeah.

07:56.165 --> 07:57.626
Am I crazy to think it could work?

07:57.855 --> 07:58.872
I mean,

07:59.047 --> 08:00.587
it's three time zones away.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.592
With any other guy, I'd say don't waste
your anytime minutes, but

08:05.926 --> 08:07.270
it's Kyle.

08:07.427 --> 08:10.096
He spent the last year pining
over you from a distance.

08:10.507 --> 08:12.557
I'm sure one semester
won't even make a dent.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.132
Dig in.

08:19.252 --> 08:21.721
Don't worry. There's, like,
zero nutritional value in there.

08:21.841 --> 08:22.851
No, thanks.

08:23.566 --> 08:26.076
I can go back and get a turkey club,
if you'd rather have that.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.906
Josh, my stomach's kind of on edge.

08:28.418 --> 08:29.763
I have a test tomorrow.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.264
Well, fear not.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.836
I got a laser printer that
can print, like, nanoscopic

08:35.956 --> 08:37.535
so I can make you the primo cheat sheet.

08:37.672 --> 08:39.417
It's not that kind of test, Josh.

08:42.215 --> 08:43.226
You mean...

08:43.346 --> 08:45.718
It's how the doctors are
planning more chemo.

08:46.356 --> 08:47.396
Right.

08:49.691 --> 08:51.602
You should get some popsicles, then.

08:51.883 --> 08:54.472
No, I was reading online that
chemo makes you really dehydrated,

08:54.592 --> 08:56.559
- and one thing that helps is popsicles.
- Josh...

08:56.682 --> 08:58.509
No, seriously. What flavors do you like?

08:59.116 --> 08:59.938
just in case

09:00.058 --> 09:02.424
- the cancer's back.
- Please don't use the C word.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.191
The other C word.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.022
Remember when I said

09:14.386 --> 09:16.371
you couldn't talk to anyone about this?

09:18.076 --> 09:19.609
Well, that includes me.

09:30.666 --> 09:31.765
Homework?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.092
Oh, God, it feels like it.

09:34.221 --> 09:36.015
I've that systems
integration test coming up.

09:36.378 --> 09:37.393
Right.

09:37.639 --> 09:39.811
Well, Ballantine sounded
very impressed with you.

09:43.411 --> 09:44.710
So, um...

09:45.113 --> 09:47.944
hey, you never really told
me about your business trip.

09:50.155 --> 09:51.489
You know, San Francisco.

09:51.715 --> 09:53.622
Oh. Well, it was... it was good.

09:53.865 --> 09:56.242
It was work, but it was good.

09:57.174 --> 09:59.489
And after everything that
happened with my dad, it...

10:00.448 --> 10:01.811
it was just nice to get away.

10:03.678 --> 10:05.020
Lori, could you get that?

10:06.335 --> 10:08.131
Well, I'm glad you got a break.

10:08.757 --> 10:11.377
Yeah. And... as it turns out,

10:11.524 --> 10:13.691
Emily's got a few
issues with her father, too.

10:14.642 --> 10:16.014
She really understood.

10:18.187 --> 10:20.212
Well, I'm glad you had
someone to talk to.

10:22.285 --> 10:23.354
Phone for you.

10:23.647 --> 10:25.221
Oh. Thanks, hon.

10:26.143 --> 10:27.200
Hello.

10:31.206 --> 10:32.206
What's up?

10:33.822 --> 10:34.826
Really?

10:35.031 --> 10:36.611
Well, that's good news.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.229
But, hey, that's why we get
paid the mid-range bucks.

10:47.864 --> 10:48.898
Absolutely.

10:49.564 --> 10:50.632
Ah, no problem.

10:51.531 --> 10:52.854
All right, you, too.

10:58.217 --> 10:59.217
Crap.

10:59.839 --> 11:01.068
You scared me.

11:01.726 --> 11:02.685
Who was that?

11:03.929 --> 11:05.490
Just someone from work.

11:07.075 --> 11:08.801
Listen, I'm gonna go
take a shower, okay?

12:25.994 --> 12:27.896
Thanks for letting me
come to work with you.

12:28.778 --> 12:31.469
Just... promise me you won't
disassemble the mainframe.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.955
<i>I didn't like misleading Stephen,</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.379
<i>but Declan was right.</i>

12:35.744 --> 12:37.155
<i>I couldn't sit back and do nothing.</i>

12:38.286 --> 12:40.236
<i>I had to face Ballantine
on his own ground,</i>

12:40.361 --> 12:42.508
<i>to try to figure out
what we were up against.</i>

12:44.538 --> 12:46.148
You've no idea how delighted I was

12:46.268 --> 12:47.727
to hear you were coming with Stephen.

12:47.874 --> 12:49.023
What brings you here today?

12:49.148 --> 12:50.482
Research for a project.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.962
Must be very important
if they let you out of school.

12:53.082 --> 12:54.436
There's a lot riding on it.

12:54.562 --> 12:56.114
Well, I hope I can lend a hand.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.850
I appreciate that.

12:58.191 --> 12:59.264
Right this way.

13:13.513 --> 13:15.652
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.</i>

13:18.615 --> 13:20.639
I don't know if Stephen
has told you much about

13:20.759 --> 13:23.751
what he's been doing here,
but he's working on the CIR,

13:23.878 --> 13:26.092
short for Cerebral Impulse Relay.

13:27.330 --> 13:30.280
It's a lot like an advanced MRI machine.

13:30.626 --> 13:32.533
You know, I must admit
I'm not a science person.

13:32.653 --> 13:34.863
I'm more of a big picture kind of a guy.

13:35.507 --> 13:37.155
Well, what's the big picture of?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.510
Well, our hope is to help patients

13:40.957 --> 13:43.262
suffering from things
like Alzheimer's disease,

13:43.382 --> 13:46.202
stroke, and dementia
recover from memory loss.

13:46.543 --> 13:49.556
Give them back that part of their lives
before they've really lost it.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.759
<i>Ballantine's goal seemed
like a noble one,</i>

13:55.616 --> 13:59.153
<i>but I couldn't help thinking he was
only telling me part of the truth.</i>

14:08.866 --> 14:09.706
Since an MRI

14:09.826 --> 14:11.499
is basically a giant magnet,

14:12.301 --> 14:14.293
no one's allowed to bring
metal into the lab.

14:40.555 --> 14:41.910
Your password, sir.

14:51.666 --> 14:52.672
Shall we?

15:06.085 --> 15:09.557
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you
to the Cerebral Impulse Relay,

15:09.979 --> 15:11.177
or CIR.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.670
But we like to call it "Sir. "

15:14.533 --> 15:15.551
Have a seat.

15:16.771 --> 15:18.357
Not to worry. She's not even online yet.

15:19.026 --> 15:20.931
We're still working out
some of the kinks.

15:21.606 --> 15:23.699
But after the system's integration test,

15:23.829 --> 15:25.293
she'll be up and running.

15:28.972 --> 15:30.453
Maybe some other time.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.997
Count on it.

15:45.655 --> 15:47.464
That ring came from Baylin.

15:47.679 --> 15:49.919
He made a point of leaving it to you.
Why would you

15:50.616 --> 15:51.994
pawn it in the first place?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.395
I tried to buy it back.

15:53.515 --> 15:55.893
And this Ballantine beat you to it.
You know, this...

15:56.847 --> 15:59.325
this ring... this ring is important.

15:59.534 --> 16:01.054
More than you know. It...

16:01.981 --> 16:02.972
What do you mean?

16:03.104 --> 16:05.657
Look, you just should have
told me sooner, that's all.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.237
I would have if
I'd known where you were.

16:09.357 --> 16:11.596
You know what? What's done is done.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.542
So what did you find out
about Ballantine?

16:18.959 --> 16:20.697
That he must be hiding something,

16:21.101 --> 16:22.797
there's enough security
at Madacorp to hide

16:22.917 --> 16:24.485
whatever it is he's hiding.

16:24.833 --> 16:25.851
Well,

16:25.971 --> 16:28.469
after Taylor, that's one
more person you can't trust.

16:31.429 --> 16:32.515
What is...

16:32.635 --> 16:33.891
What is he doing here?

16:34.011 --> 16:36.187
- What are you doing here?
- He wants to help us.

16:36.310 --> 16:38.980
Like you said, Foss, Kyle's running out
of people he can trust.

16:41.154 --> 16:42.817
Help us do what?

16:43.508 --> 16:44.539
Get answers.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.999
Ballantine invadedy home,
my family, and my privacy.

16:52.573 --> 16:54.745
I don't know what he's doing
with my ring and wants

16:54.865 --> 16:57.373
- with me or the Tragers.
- So what do you want to do?

16:58.466 --> 17:00.156
I want to get my ring back.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.050
I'm glad you came.

17:08.844 --> 17:10.869
Well, it's important for Jessi.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.523
Come on in.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.601
Thanks, Nicole.

17:17.557 --> 17:18.900
See you in an hour.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.416
Right.

17:21.372 --> 17:22.272
I...

17:23.287 --> 17:24.608
I like your glasses.

17:25.159 --> 17:26.594
Oh, yeah?

17:26.894 --> 17:28.029
I lost my contacts.

17:29.217 --> 17:31.282
You should lose them
more often. You look great.

17:32.107 --> 17:33.784
Thanks. Bye.

17:38.772 --> 17:39.779
Come on.

17:51.309 --> 17:54.809
The cameras we have to worry about
are here, here, and here.

17:55.048 --> 17:57.948
We can disable those,
assuming they're on the same circuit.

17:58.068 --> 18:00.692
Then there are motion detectors,
double-redundant I.D. interfaces,

18:00.815 --> 18:02.168
and retina scanners.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.355
What's the matter?

18:05.935 --> 18:07.008
I just

18:07.215 --> 18:08.614
wonder where he comes in.

18:08.734 --> 18:09.975
Worry about yourself, Foss.

18:10.441 --> 18:13.030
Wrong. I have to worry about you
because you could get me killed.

18:13.153 --> 18:14.798
We all have to work together on this.

18:15.517 --> 18:18.162
We have one shot, one opportunity.

18:19.152 --> 18:20.706
The system's integration test is

18:20.826 --> 18:23.209
the only time we know
where and when Ballantine will be,

18:23.329 --> 18:24.877
and he'll have to take his ring off.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.171
That's our window.

18:30.539 --> 18:32.057
It's tomorrow or nothing.

18:35.105 --> 18:37.679
I don't know.
I'm just seeing weird things.

18:38.194 --> 18:39.225
Weird how?

18:42.114 --> 18:44.355
I have this memory of being in a fire.

18:45.281 --> 18:48.192
I asked my sister about it,
and she said there wasn't any fire.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.948
Sometimes it helps to draw the images.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.675
It may help to clarify some things.

18:59.862 --> 19:01.158
Want to give it a try?

19:08.913 --> 19:10.780
Don't worry how it looks. Just...

19:10.950 --> 19:12.138
draw what you feel.

19:32.850 --> 19:34.405
Did someone teach you to draw that way?

19:35.046 --> 19:37.325
No. Am I doing it wrong?

19:37.794 --> 19:38.802
No, no.

19:39.966 --> 19:42.413
You... Go on. You're doing fine.

19:53.782 --> 19:55.908
And you're sure this will
fool Madacorp's retina scan?

19:56.031 --> 19:58.723
As long as Kyle can upload it
into the security system.

19:59.510 --> 20:00.715
The image is clean.

20:11.939 --> 20:13.058
Amanda, you got my message.

20:13.281 --> 20:14.582
Yeah. I got the tickets.

20:14.706 --> 20:16.103
Totally scored the orchestra seats.

20:19.595 --> 20:20.608
Are you all right?

20:21.410 --> 20:22.410
Yes.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.659
I'm sorry, but something came up.

20:25.629 --> 20:26.630
What?

20:26.750 --> 20:27.965
<i>Something important.</i>

20:30.522 --> 20:31.666
It happens.

20:33.472 --> 20:35.080
I promise I'll make it up to you.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.973
Don't worry about it.

20:37.907 --> 20:38.907
It's no big deal.

20:42.285 --> 20:43.358
I'd better go.

20:55.752 --> 20:57.067
You got a minute?

20:57.223 --> 20:58.350
Sure.

20:59.849 --> 21:01.152
I need to talk to you,

21:01.785 --> 21:02.983
strictly confidential.

21:04.035 --> 21:05.035
Okay.

21:05.893 --> 21:08.030
So you're not my mom,
you're my therapist.

21:26.038 --> 21:27.101
Andy has cancer.

21:29.364 --> 21:30.385
Oh, no.

21:33.578 --> 21:35.557
Oh, Josh, I'm so sorry.

21:37.868 --> 21:39.599
I finally meet a girl that I like...

21:40.475 --> 21:41.882
I mean, she's awesome.

21:42.477 --> 21:44.065
She likes to play G-Force.

21:44.185 --> 21:45.623
She loves zombie movies...

21:46.557 --> 21:48.528
the unrated ones
you think I don't watch.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
And...

21:51.948 --> 21:53.370
I want to help her through this,

21:53.490 --> 21:55.461
but she won't let me
talk to her about it.

21:56.603 --> 21:58.955
What would you say to her if you could?

22:00.039 --> 22:01.039
I don't know.

22:02.601 --> 22:04.242
Something to make her feel better.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.864
You may not have to say
anything to do that.

22:10.852 --> 22:13.336
Andy might just need you
to hang in there with her,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.827
and if the time comes

22:17.184 --> 22:18.549
when she wants to talk,

22:19.603 --> 22:20.762
you'll be ready.

24:18.731 --> 24:19.961
Paige.

24:28.798 --> 24:29.823
Hello.

24:29.943 --> 24:30.953
<i>It's Kyle.</i>

24:31.073 --> 24:32.609
Hi. Is everything okay?

24:32.991 --> 24:35.670
<i>Well, when I was in your office,
I think I left my binder.</i>

24:36.432 --> 24:38.193
Okay, well, I can bring it home with me.

24:38.313 --> 24:39.317
<i>I can pick it up.</i>

24:40.792 --> 24:42.821
It's kind of important,
I'm not that far away.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.859
Well, I'm heading to
the systems integration test,

24:45.979 --> 24:47.956
but I can have security let you in.

24:48.735 --> 24:49.735
Thanks.

24:51.499 --> 24:52.803
No turning back now.

24:53.114 --> 24:54.295
You sure you wanna do this?

24:54.736 --> 24:56.212
Yeah. Are you?

24:58.673 --> 24:59.673
Absolutely.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.613
<i>- Hello.
- Stephen Trager, please.</i>

25:28.698 --> 25:30.518
He's not in. Can I take a message?

25:30.765 --> 25:32.676
I'm calling from the Stratford Hotel.

25:33.020 --> 25:34.786
<i>Mr. Trager stayed here last weekend,</i>

25:34.906 --> 25:37.920
<i>and it seems he left
his contact lenses in his room.</i>

25:38.854 --> 25:40.365
My dad doesn't wear contacts.

25:40.649 --> 25:42.144
<i>Are you certain? He was the last...</i>

25:42.272 --> 25:43.374
Who is that?

25:44.161 --> 25:45.489
Wrong number.

25:45.925 --> 25:46.989
Okay.

26:00.305 --> 26:03.084
Here's hoping the test goes
as well as it did in simulations.

26:06.939 --> 26:08.494
Well, you'll be fired if it doesn't.

26:11.174 --> 26:12.242
Kidding.

26:13.043 --> 26:14.619
But Hollander's out on her ass.

26:23.128 --> 26:24.258
Mr. Ballantine's office.

26:24.381 --> 26:27.680
<i>I've got a package for Mr. Ballantine
that I need a signature for.</i>

26:27.983 --> 26:29.089
<i>I'll be right down.</i>

26:29.209 --> 26:30.209
Thanks.

26:59.331 --> 27:01.088
How do we bypass the security system?

27:01.208 --> 27:02.826
Once I get inside Ballantine's office...

27:03.479 --> 27:04.557
<i>Your password, sir.</i>

27:06.901 --> 27:08.762
<i>I'll be able to access
the Madacorp mainframe.</i>

27:11.208 --> 27:13.183
<i>That'll give me
complete control of all building's</i>

27:13.303 --> 27:15.644
<i>video cameras, doors,
and retina scanners.</i>

27:18.462 --> 27:21.373
<i>I'll be able to switch the image
of Foss' retina with Ballantine's.</i>

27:23.404 --> 27:25.101
<i>And you know where you'll be.</i>

27:34.856 --> 27:36.244
Let me go, man! Get off me!

27:36.364 --> 27:38.652
Gonna take this punk upstairs.
Cops gonna deal with him.

27:38.772 --> 27:40.671
Get off me, man! I didn't do anything!

27:41.046 --> 27:43.051
The truth is out there!
Resistance is futile!

27:46.871 --> 27:48.974
You have a package here
for Mr. Ballantine?

27:56.785 --> 27:59.011
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.</i>

28:08.829 --> 28:10.882
Damn it, did you have
to practically break my arm?

28:11.005 --> 28:12.419
I had to look convincing.

28:12.714 --> 28:14.165
Why not just taser me?

28:15.493 --> 28:17.042
I considered it.

28:21.457 --> 28:22.687
Don't mess this up.

28:23.474 --> 28:25.367
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

28:26.695 --> 28:28.001
<i>You copy, Smith?</i>

28:29.948 --> 28:30.843
Go for Smith.

28:30.963 --> 28:34.430
We got a report of a disturbance
in the North B stairwell.

28:35.653 --> 28:36.771
Copy that.

29:01.863 --> 29:03.382
<i>The guard will be detained...</i>

29:04.723 --> 29:05.795
<i>and so will the assistant.</i>

29:11.443 --> 29:12.808
Foss, you're good to go.

29:18.442 --> 29:19.475
781227.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.078
My code name at ZZYZX.

29:22.767 --> 29:24.820
What did Ballantine
have to do with ZZYZX?

29:42.716 --> 29:44.792
I need to see my dad right now.

29:45.028 --> 29:46.430
<i>Miss, is he expecting you?</i>

29:46.693 --> 29:48.115
No, he's not expecting me.

29:48.235 --> 29:50.296
I tell you it's a family emergency!

29:50.419 --> 29:51.888
He's in the middle of a software test.

29:52.011 --> 29:53.132
Fine. I'll wait.

30:07.524 --> 30:10.253
<i>I had no idea what I'd find
on Ballantine's computer,</i>

30:10.752 --> 30:12.027
<i>but once I was there,</i>

30:12.659 --> 30:14.696
<i>I had to take advantage
of the opportunity.</i>

30:17.254 --> 30:18.914
<i>781228.</i>

30:19.819 --> 30:22.461
<i>I thought the experiments
at ZZYZX had ended with me.</i>

30:24.354 --> 30:27.047
Well, looks like you two have
your jobs for another day.

30:27.681 --> 30:29.711
- Was that a congratulations?
- I think so.

30:35.337 --> 30:37.177
Lori, what's wrong?

30:37.517 --> 30:40.013
I need to talk to you in private.

30:40.825 --> 30:42.460
Well, let's go to my office.

30:43.136 --> 30:44.277
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

30:58.809 --> 31:01.407
Looks like someone's upset
over some contact lenses.

31:17.922 --> 31:18.968
We got a problem.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.095
<i>- Did you get the ring?
- No.</i>

31:21.674 --> 31:24.349
Ballantine has it.
He's headed your way. Get out now.

31:43.383 --> 31:44.577
Mr. Ballantine,

31:44.697 --> 31:46.329
there has been a security breach.

32:11.748 --> 32:13.189
Are you Paige?

32:13.605 --> 32:14.690
Where's your mommy?

32:14.908 --> 32:15.929
Away.

32:22.061 --> 32:23.950
- What's wrong?
- I wanted a lion.

32:28.838 --> 32:30.534
- Can I have a crayon?
- Sure.

32:39.819 --> 32:40.883
Who are you?

32:41.971 --> 32:43.177
Just a friend.

32:53.752 --> 32:54.891
What's going on?

32:57.750 --> 32:59.471
Honey, whatever it is, you can tell me.

32:59.607 --> 33:01.453
Are you having an affair with Emily?

33:03.592 --> 33:04.782
Why would you think that?

33:05.141 --> 33:06.203
The hotel called,

33:06.323 --> 33:08.062
the one you stayed at
on your business trip.

33:08.182 --> 33:10.287
They said you left your
contact lenses in the room.

33:10.968 --> 33:12.247
I don't wear contacts.

33:12.456 --> 33:14.249
I know. But Emily does.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.456
Oh, honey, the hotel made a mistake.

33:18.654 --> 33:20.154
I'm just afraid you did.

33:24.519 --> 33:25.594
Nothing happened.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.293
I've seen how you act when she calls.

33:28.416 --> 33:30.767
You get all happy and excited.

33:30.924 --> 33:32.732
We work together.
She understands what I do.

33:32.852 --> 33:34.352
She understands you're married?

33:37.074 --> 33:39.084
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

33:39.204 --> 33:40.320
No problem.

33:44.907 --> 33:46.865
That guard is Kyle's handler.

33:53.379 --> 33:54.616
- Did you get the ring?
- No.

33:54.736 --> 33:55.973
We got to get out of here.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.375
Wait. Where's Foss?

33:57.495 --> 33:58.334
He's coming.

33:58.913 --> 33:59.913
There he is.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.227
Ballantine's headed this way.

34:05.336 --> 34:06.546
- Wait. Is he close?
- What?

34:06.669 --> 34:07.898
Yes. We got to go.

34:08.058 --> 34:10.007
Can you stop the doors from retracting?

34:10.143 --> 34:11.208
I can.

34:14.550 --> 34:15.550
What?

34:15.717 --> 34:16.895
MacGyver reruns.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.109
<i>The problem seemed complex,</i>

34:23.398 --> 34:26.196
<i>but the math was a simple mix
of algebra and geometry.</i>

34:27.085 --> 34:29.114
<i>The angle of the incidence
equals the angle of</i>

34:29.235 --> 34:30.742
<i>reflection on the Madacorp logo.</i>

34:30.862 --> 34:33.036
- What are you doing? Kyle!
- Come on, man.

34:33.466 --> 34:35.204
That gave me Ballantine's distance.

34:36.295 --> 34:38.417
<i>Distance divided by the time
told me that he'd reach</i>

34:38.536 --> 34:39.560
<i>the elevator in...</i>

34:39.679 --> 34:41.791
Three, two, one.

34:41.911 --> 34:42.953
Do it now.

35:00.927 --> 35:02.488
Lock down the building now.

35:05.906 --> 35:08.144
The building is now on lockdown.

35:08.267 --> 35:10.197
There's an emergency exit
out in the lobby.

35:15.212 --> 35:16.212
Are you okay?

35:16.712 --> 35:17.997
Uh, I'm fine.

35:18.176 --> 35:19.332
You're not fine.

35:19.565 --> 35:20.889
Get up. Come on.

35:22.602 --> 35:23.762
We got company.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.750
- Just leave me.
- No.

35:26.803 --> 35:27.868
They're coming.

35:27.988 --> 35:29.003
Get him out of here.

35:29.404 --> 35:31.302
- What are you gonna do?
- Buy you some time.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.596
- We're not leaving you.
- Listen to me.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.556
The ring is all you need.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.224
- What?
- Now go.

35:37.646 --> 35:39.639
- Thank you.
- Get out of here!

35:51.516 --> 35:53.125
We need backup, Level 3!

36:07.082 --> 36:08.267
Stupid ankle.

36:08.430 --> 36:09.783
- I have to go back.
- You can't.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.922
They'll take the ring,
it'll have been for nothing.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.454
- But Foss...
- He wanted you to get that ring back.

36:18.903 --> 36:20.018
I hope it's worth it.

36:37.042 --> 36:38.063
Sir,

36:38.481 --> 36:40.362
we got this one,
but the others got away.

36:41.210 --> 36:42.759
Take him to room 237.

36:45.034 --> 36:46.076
Move it.

37:56.258 --> 37:57.648
A kiss for Mommy?

37:58.734 --> 37:59.805
I missed you.

38:00.057 --> 38:01.826
I missed you more.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.489
Is this me?

38:04.635 --> 38:06.956
No. That's my new friend.

38:07.180 --> 38:08.541
Your new friend?

38:10.475 --> 38:12.332
Yeah. She made me these.

38:23.876 --> 38:25.850
Okay, sweetie, let's go.

38:30.528 --> 38:31.547
I was just...

38:31.667 --> 38:33.381
returning a CD of Lori's.

38:36.264 --> 38:38.863
Did you have fun,
doing whatever you had to do?

38:39.964 --> 38:42.199
I wish I could have gone
to the concert with you.

38:43.309 --> 38:44.588
It's okay.

38:45.571 --> 38:46.752
I understand.

38:49.964 --> 38:51.612
Actually, I don't understand.

38:51.919 --> 38:54.021
One minute you're thrilled
to spend time with me

38:54.157 --> 38:55.664
and all excited to go to the concert,

38:55.784 --> 38:58.067
and then you cancel
without telling me why.

38:59.001 --> 39:02.100
You say it's important, but
you won't tell me why it's important.

39:05.481 --> 39:06.807
I know what's going on.

39:07.435 --> 39:08.517
You do?

39:09.464 --> 39:11.038
I rushed you into this.

39:11.345 --> 39:13.105
Admit it. Now you're having doubts.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.817
I do have doubts, but...

39:16.937 --> 39:19.528
If that's the way you feel,
I need to tell you something...

39:19.648 --> 39:20.690
No.

39:22.410 --> 39:24.734
I have doubts
about everything in my life...

39:25.693 --> 39:27.494
except how I feel about you.

39:28.949 --> 39:29.959
I just...

39:44.118 --> 39:46.138
What did you need to tell me?

39:47.521 --> 39:48.809
Not important.

40:07.836 --> 40:09.250
How bad do you suck?

40:10.288 --> 40:11.398
Well, you do.

40:14.062 --> 40:15.513
Gonna give me a chance?

40:19.060 --> 40:20.150
At the game?

40:22.497 --> 40:23.652
Aren't you working?

40:24.845 --> 40:26.579
You're just afraid I'll smoke you.

40:26.702 --> 40:27.734
Right.

40:28.076 --> 40:29.338
Dream much?

40:39.672 --> 40:41.234
I got the test results.

40:49.799 --> 40:50.901
And?

40:51.720 --> 40:54.205
Let's just say I'm gonna
need a lot of Popsicles.

41:14.652 --> 41:15.835
Cherry okay?

41:23.089 --> 41:24.089
My favorite.

41:27.737 --> 41:28.840
Want half?

41:29.323 --> 41:30.402
Cool.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.208
- My turn?
- Hit it.

41:37.486 --> 41:38.777
I'm gonna try the...

41:42.937 --> 41:43.963
Mr. Ballantine?

41:44.083 --> 41:45.131
Your appointment is here.

41:45.251 --> 41:46.519
Send him in.

41:51.554 --> 41:53.347
It's nice to finally
meet you, Mr. Taylor.

41:53.791 --> 41:54.993
Pleasure.

41:58.303 --> 41:59.687
We had a little security breach.

42:00.036 --> 42:02.744
Someone stole my ring,
but it's being taken care of.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.025
It had better be.

42:06.682 --> 42:08.568
No need for alarm. It was just a...

42:08.691 --> 42:10.197
heirloom from my late father.

42:12.630 --> 42:13.921
An heirloom.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.450
That heirloom is a Latnock ring.

42:18.445 --> 42:20.240
You people and your rings.

42:20.998 --> 42:24.211
Forgive me if I don't lose any sleep
over a glorified pledge pin.

42:24.428 --> 42:26.924
You really don't have any idea

42:27.047 --> 42:29.064
how important that ring is.

42:29.813 --> 42:30.676
Do you?

42:43.067 --> 42:46.608
<i>Adam Baylin's secret had been locked
inside this box for 15 years,</i>

42:47.377 --> 42:49.226
<i>almost as long as I'd been alive.</i>

42:50.221 --> 42:52.531
<i>Would his secrets provide
the answers to my own?</i>

42:52.853 --> 42:54.753
Or simply raise more questions?

42:55.853 --> 42:58.079
There was only one way to know for sure.
