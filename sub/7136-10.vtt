WEBVTT

01:47.100 --> 01:49.700
- Every person on the planet
was raised to believe

01:49.767 --> 01:51.700
some version of the truth,

01:51.767 --> 01:53.533
about God, about morality,

01:53.600 --> 01:55.367
mortality,
about the purpose of life.

01:55.433 --> 01:58.200
We usually call those beliefs
"religion."

01:58.266 --> 02:00.033
And if,
over the course of living,

02:00.100 --> 02:01.367
those beliefs break down,

02:01.433 --> 02:04.133
if they prove themselves
not to be true,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.533
we search
for a new religion to follow,

02:06.600 --> 02:08.533
and we convert.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.133
Now, that conversion
can be traumatic,

02:12.200 --> 02:15.000
not only for ourselves,
our souls,

02:15.066 --> 02:17.000
but for those around us.

02:19.066 --> 02:20.900
- Can I have your attention?

02:20.967 --> 02:24.000
Everybody's attention, please!

02:25.300 --> 02:29.834
In my ongoing effort to improve
the quality of your lives,

02:29.900 --> 02:32.266
I'm instituting
a couple of new programs.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.600
Starting today, once a week,

02:35.667 --> 02:38.000
we're gonna show you
an instructional video

02:38.066 --> 02:40.166
for one half-hour of TV time.

02:40.233 --> 02:44.000
Yes, yes,
and attendance is mandatory.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.500
- Bullshit!
- Hey, hey!

02:46.567 --> 02:48.367
I want to hear silence!

02:48.433 --> 02:51.467
- Over there
is another idea of mine.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.700
Now, when you violate the rules,

02:56.767 --> 02:58.533
instead of sending you
to the Hole,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.200
we're gonna stick you
inside that cage

03:00.266 --> 03:02.467
in full view
of your adoring public.

03:02.533 --> 03:03.700
Any questions?

03:03.767 --> 03:06.166
- Mr. McManus, sir?

03:06.233 --> 03:08.300
How big is your penis?

03:10.934 --> 03:12.633
- Keller, you get the honor

03:12.700 --> 03:15.266
of being the first slug
inside the cage.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.166
- Keller, way to go!

03:21.934 --> 03:23.166
- You faggot.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.567
- Hey, Keller, heads up, man.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.800
- All right.
Everybody else find a seat.

03:30.867 --> 03:33.000
Here's the first video.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.166
Let 'er rip.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.834
- Life's like a house.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.567
Sure, you can paint it
and decorate it alone,

03:39.633 --> 03:42.033
but then
only you'll appreciate it.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.066
Others won't.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.433
And don't you want them to?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.667
That's what community is for.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.367
- Hey, you out of here?
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.066
- Hey, yo, you tell everybody
in Emerald City

03:56.133 --> 03:58.700
that Supreme Allah is not done,
you hear me?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.433
Tell them
Supreme Allah is coming back.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.834
And he coming back strong.
- Quiet down, Ketchum.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.367
- Word is bond.
Let 'em know.

04:03.433 --> 04:04.867
- Let's go.
Let's go.

04:04.934 --> 04:06.033
- I got you out of Solitary

04:06.100 --> 04:07.533
because you said
you want to change.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.867
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.934 --> 04:10.900
- Well, I'm giving you
that chance, Omar,

04:10.967 --> 04:13.133
and I'm gonna do
whatever I can to help.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.867
But I need you off the drugs.

04:14.934 --> 04:16.633
- Mm-hmm.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.133
- You screw up again,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.467
I'm gonna send you
right back to Solitary.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.967
Do you understand?

04:23.033 --> 04:24.734
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.300
- Okay.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.066
- Shit, he called me
a drug abuser, man.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.333
I ain't no drug abuser, Jack.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.667
I mean, truth be told, son,

04:31.734 --> 04:33.934
I treat my drugs better
than most.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.934
Now he wants me to go to rehab.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.333
- Rehab is cool, man.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.400
You get to talk
about yourself a lot.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.834
- Well, I'm doing,
what, 17 to life?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.166
By the time I get out
this motherfucker,

04:42.233 --> 04:44.834
ain't gonna be shit to recover.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.333
You know what I'm saying, son?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.834
- Miguel Alvarez, a fugitive

04:48.900 --> 04:50.500
from the Oswald State
Correctional Facility

04:50.567 --> 04:53.000
for the past six months,
has been captured.

04:53.066 --> 04:55.333
Customs agents
near Nogales, Arizona,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.166
found Alvarez late last night

04:57.233 --> 05:00.166
as he tried
to cross the border into Mexico.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.533
In other news...
- Alvarez is coming back.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.700
- So?

05:03.767 --> 05:05.333
- The motherfucker
tried to kill me.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.867
- Yeah, only because
you tried to kill him.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.967
Or did I get the story wrong?

05:12.900 --> 05:14.934
You let it go, chico.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.734
- How you doing, Glynn?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
You miss me?

05:29.867 --> 05:31.734
- No.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.000
- You know, I almost made it.

05:35.066 --> 05:37.233
I almost made it into Mexico.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.133
- We would have found you there.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.333
- I don't think so.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.000
You know, I would have made
my way to Guatemala, Nicaragua,

05:44.066 --> 05:45.834
Colombia...

05:45.900 --> 05:48.500
walk the Andes through Chile

05:48.567 --> 05:51.467
to light this little spark
called Tierra del Fuego.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.667
You know about Tierra del Fuego?

05:53.734 --> 05:55.934
- It's the end of the earth.
- That's right.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You would have gone that far
to capture me?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.567
The end of the earth?

05:59.633 --> 06:01.400
- Probably not.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.500
- Next time.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.233
- Take him to Solitary.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.233
- What's up, man?

06:22.367 --> 06:23.734
- Keep moving.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.000
- Who's that?

06:33.066 --> 06:34.667
- What's it matter?

06:35.900 --> 06:37.800
- I just like to know
the quality of criminal

06:37.867 --> 06:39.133
I'm neighboring with.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.633
- He's a wank job.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.266
Just like you.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.066
Shit.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.333
- Can you put something
in Alvarez's food?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.133
- Like what?
- I don't know.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.967
Rat poison or something--
look, the point is,

07:17.033 --> 07:18.800
you kill him, Omar,
I'll see that you get

07:18.867 --> 07:20.467
all the fucking tits you need.

07:20.533 --> 07:21.467
Huh?

07:21.533 --> 07:22.800
What do you say?

07:24.200 --> 07:26.467
- No.
- No?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.133
Why no?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.800
- I just don't like you.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.633
- You don't like me?

07:31.700 --> 07:33.400
- I can't put my finger on it,
it's like...

07:33.467 --> 07:35.800
I don't know
if it's the way you look,

07:35.867 --> 07:37.967
the way you smell,
your breath, the way you talk--

07:38.033 --> 07:38.967
I don't know, but you know,

07:39.033 --> 07:39.967
there's just something about you

07:40.033 --> 07:42.066
just rubs me the wrong way.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.467
- Oh, yeah?

07:43.533 --> 07:45.900
Well, fuck you, nigger.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.166
- Do not resist!

07:59.533 --> 08:02.967
- We got a 66.
We got a code 66.

08:08.066 --> 08:09.667
- You back?
- Uh-huh.

08:09.734 --> 08:11.100
- Fuck, nigga, that gotta be

08:11.166 --> 08:12.533
some kind of record
or something.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.266
- You Alvarez?

08:15.333 --> 08:17.367
- Yeah.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.266
- You owe me, dawg.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.700
- Inside.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.300
- Claire?
- Yeah?

08:28.367 --> 08:29.600
- Hey, how much
do you love me?

08:29.667 --> 08:31.000
- Oh, plenty.

08:31.066 --> 08:33.800
- Enough to do anything I ask?

08:33.867 --> 08:36.300
- Yeah.
- Attagirl.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.567
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

08:38.633 --> 08:39.767
You fucked Howell?

08:39.834 --> 08:41.433
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.633
- You don't just drop
a nugget like that

08:42.700 --> 08:44.867
without a few details, O'Reily.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.800
- We had sex maybe five times
in the ladies' toilet

08:47.867 --> 08:49.633
off the interview room.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.400
And she got weird.

08:51.467 --> 08:52.467
- What do you mean, "weird"?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.600
Weird, like,
"possessive weird"?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.667
- Yeah.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.834
So when McManus came back
and took over Em City

08:58.900 --> 09:00.166
and shipped her off to Unit J,

09:00.233 --> 09:04.133
I was,
to say the least, relieved.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.000
I haven't seen much
of her since.

09:06.066 --> 09:09.667
- My esteem for you
has risen 69%,

09:09.734 --> 09:12.266
but tell me, as one
manipulative turd to another,

09:12.333 --> 09:13.934
now, did you fuck Howell
for the sex

09:14.000 --> 09:17.600
or to get her to do
some other kind of nasty?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.266
- Just the sex.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.834
Check.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.934
- Fuck.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.233
- Don't you be winking at me!

09:40.300 --> 09:41.500
- What?
- Claire!

09:41.567 --> 09:42.500
- The fucking bastard's
winking at me!

09:42.567 --> 09:43.500
Take him to the Hole!

09:43.567 --> 09:44.600
- That's bullshit!

09:44.667 --> 09:45.633
- Take him to the Hole.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.200
- Mineo.
- Joe.

09:47.266 --> 09:48.467
- All right, all right.

09:48.533 --> 09:49.633
But you're filling out
the paperwork.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.967
- Mineo.

09:51.033 --> 09:51.967
What?

09:52.033 --> 09:54.400
You fucking dyke!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.500
- Ryan.

10:08.567 --> 10:09.500
Have you missed me?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.233
- Oh, Christ.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.667
- Dr. Nathan, welcome back.

10:22.734 --> 10:24.767
- Thanks, it's good to be back.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.200
- Oh, no.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.166
I wanted to put these
on your desk before you arrived.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.867
- Oh, Pete.

10:34.934 --> 10:35.867
Hi.

10:35.934 --> 10:37.300
- Wow, you look great.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.867
- Thanks, I feel great.

10:38.934 --> 10:40.533
You know, renewed,

10:40.600 --> 10:42.633
ready to jump back into
the job with both feet.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.367
- Listen, I've got six seconds
before group,

10:44.433 --> 10:46.266
so let's meet later
and review the current cases.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.266
Okay?

10:47.333 --> 10:48.266
Bienvenida.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.367
- Gracias.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.800
- Dr. Nathan, we need you.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.700
- This guy took a shank
to the face.

10:54.767 --> 10:56.200
The other guy wasn't as lucky.

10:56.266 --> 10:57.767
- Cyril O'Reily.

10:57.834 --> 11:00.200
- Yeah, I heard what he did
to that news guy, Jack Eldridge,

11:00.266 --> 11:01.700
nearly beating him to death.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.600
- Cyril's condition
is only getting worse.

11:03.667 --> 11:07.066
We can't find
the right balance of medication.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.900
- Hmm, I'd like to examine him.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.000
Can you arrange that, Tim?

11:10.066 --> 11:12.834
- Sure.
- So, who's next?

11:12.900 --> 11:14.000
- I think that's it.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.667
- Okay, I'm off to group.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.000
- Hey, Pete, see you.
- Bye.

11:18.066 --> 11:19.467
What are you doing?

11:19.533 --> 11:20.467
Want to have some dinner?

11:20.533 --> 11:22.300
- Nah.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.600
- Well,
I really only mean dinner.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.834
- I know.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.667
Rain check, okay?

11:27.734 --> 11:28.667
See ya.

11:28.734 --> 11:30.433
- See ya.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.400
- Okay, good.
Put your shirt on.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.066
- Dr. Nathan, where you been?

11:41.133 --> 11:44.867
- I took a few months off,
a little vacation.

11:44.934 --> 11:47.200
- After you got raped?

11:47.266 --> 11:49.367
- Uh, yeah.

11:49.433 --> 11:51.266
- I wish I could have.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.266
- Could have what?

11:53.333 --> 11:57.033
- Taken a vacation
after I got raped.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.500
It was okay, though.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.100
I had Ryan to help me.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.133
- Yeah, he's a very helpful guy.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.700
- I wish I could help him.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.700
He's sick.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.533
When he was in the Hole,
he got a cold.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.300
- You can take him back.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.166
- For Chrissake, O'Reily,
quit coughing on the food.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.233
You're gonna get
the whole fucking prison sick.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.667
- Relax, man,
I'm not contagious anymore.

12:22.734 --> 12:23.834
- Yeah.

12:34.734 --> 12:37.767
Hey, on second thought...

12:39.567 --> 12:40.834
I'm not feeling so hot
after all.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.834
I gotta go to the infirmary.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.533
- Deep breath.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.867
Again.

12:53.934 --> 12:56.200
Yeah, you do sound congested.

12:56.266 --> 12:59.200
Give him a hit of albuterol.
Let's keep him overnight.

12:59.266 --> 13:01.700
- Follow me.

13:14.066 --> 13:15.633
- Welcome back.
- Huh?

13:15.700 --> 13:16.734
- Welcome back.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.033
- Oh, thanks, Claire.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.667
- I just wanted you to know

13:22.734 --> 13:26.333
I'm taking good care
of Ryan O'Reily for you.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.633
- What do you mean?

13:27.700 --> 13:31.767
- You know,
giving him a helping hand.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.233
- Get back in bed.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.867
- No, that's okay, Benny.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.300
I want to talk to him.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.700
But stay nearby.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.033
Are you feeling better?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.734
- Uh-huh.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.867
- Did you send me this?

14:18.367 --> 14:19.633
- Yes.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.533
- You killed him, didn't you?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.900
Keenan?

14:31.500 --> 14:32.900
- Yes.

14:32.967 --> 14:35.500
- You admit to murdering him,
even though you know

14:35.567 --> 14:37.667
I could tell the warden
that you confessed,

14:37.734 --> 14:39.567
and you'd probably end up
on death row?

14:39.633 --> 14:41.834
- Keenan raped you.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.333
He didn't deserve to breathe.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.166
If I have to die
because of that...

14:47.233 --> 14:49.100
okay.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.967
Kill me.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.066
- Go to bed.

14:57.567 --> 14:58.533
- I love you.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.667
- Benny, Carl, we're finished.

15:17.533 --> 15:20.567
I have hated Ryan O'Reily
for so long.

15:21.867 --> 15:24.066
So deeply.

15:24.133 --> 15:27.700
He's responsible
for the death of my husband,

15:27.767 --> 15:29.467
but he did it
out of love for me.

15:29.533 --> 15:32.633
And Keenan too.
All for me.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.934
He loves me more
than Preston ever did.

15:35.033 --> 15:39.166
Ryan's love is enormous.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.367
Overwhelming.
Unconditional.

15:42.433 --> 15:44.200
Undying.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.667
Am I crazy to push him away,
or...

15:47.734 --> 15:49.767
- Gloria, listen to yourself.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.433
His love is anything
but unconditional...

15:54.500 --> 15:58.333
and often anything but love.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.834
Now, look.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.333
The feelings he has for you
are dangerous.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.667
He is dangerous.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.166
And for you to encourage him,

16:05.233 --> 16:07.900
given that you don't share
those feelings--

16:08.000 --> 16:10.533
- But I do.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.967
I do share his feelings.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.166
God help me.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.900
I love Ryan O'Reily.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.667
- When Christopher Columbus
landed in the new world,

16:46.734 --> 16:49.633
a Catholic priest
was right alongside him.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.000
From then on, priests kept
coming over to this continent

16:52.066 --> 16:54.000
trying to convert the Indians,

16:54.066 --> 16:56.000
trying to get them
to kiss the crucifix,

16:56.066 --> 17:00.033
to stop smoking peyote,
to cover up their nakedness.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.667
The Indians responded
with great enthusiasm.

17:03.734 --> 17:06.266
They maimed, tortured,
and burned the priests

17:06.333 --> 17:09.367
and then offered the bodies up
to their own gods.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.266
- What's this?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.633
- James Devlin is about
to get inaugurated

17:16.700 --> 17:19.166
for his second term as governor.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.633
- Hey. Change the station.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.967
- It won't do no good.

17:22.033 --> 17:24.133
The scum fuck's
on every channel.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.633
- Yeah,
we need to petition the warden

17:25.700 --> 17:27.400
to get us some cable up in here.

17:29.033 --> 17:31.734
- Augustus,
he's got wheels like you.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.266
- Will you look at that?

17:34.333 --> 17:35.800
- I do solemnly swear

17:35.867 --> 17:37.800
to execute
the office of governor

17:37.867 --> 17:39.333
to the best of my abilities

17:39.400 --> 17:42.300
and to preserve, protect,
and defend

17:42.367 --> 17:44.800
the constitution of this state,

17:44.867 --> 17:47.800
with equality and justice
for all,

17:47.867 --> 17:49.000
so help me God.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.100
- Wishing you were up there?

17:55.567 --> 17:57.667
- Neil Bourne will make
a great lieutenant governor.

17:57.734 --> 17:59.166
- That's not what I asked.

17:59.233 --> 18:01.500
Do you regret
dropping out of the race?

18:02.900 --> 18:05.000
- Nope.
- Good.

18:05.066 --> 18:09.333
- Warden,
Barry Levine on line two.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.734
- Who's Barry Levine?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.834
- I don't know.
He says he knows you.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.400
- Barry Levine?

18:15.467 --> 18:17.367
- He wants to talk to you
about the warden's conference?

18:17.433 --> 18:20.400
- Oh, you mean Barney Levin?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.834
- Oh, maybe that's what he said.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.467
- Look, tell him
I'll call him back later.

18:24.533 --> 18:26.367
And use the goddamn intercom.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.233
- Yes, sir.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.300
- Man,
Busmalis is driving me crazy.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.333
He's the worst assistant
I ever had.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.800
He gets numbers wrong.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.934
He screws up appointments.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.300
I'm hosting
the regional conference

18:38.367 --> 18:39.967
of the Wardens Association
next week,

18:40.033 --> 18:44.266
and he has managed
to mangle every detail.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.467
- So get another prisoner
to assist you.

18:45.533 --> 18:46.700
- Who?

18:46.767 --> 18:49.166
How many drug dealers
can use Excel?

18:49.233 --> 18:50.700
- Hire someone from outside.

18:50.767 --> 18:51.967
- Every time I do,
they end up quitting.

18:52.033 --> 18:54.800
They get jumpy working here.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.667
I need to find somebody
who's smart,

18:58.734 --> 19:01.667
funny, diplomatic...

19:01.734 --> 19:02.734
and fearless.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.367
- I may have
the perfect person.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.100
A woman I met...

19:07.166 --> 19:09.166
doing volunteer work
at a homeless shelter.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.700
Her name is Floria Mills.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.800
- I'm not late, am I?

19:13.867 --> 19:15.667
- No, you're right on time.

19:15.734 --> 19:17.667
- Oh, my car broke down
on the expressway.

19:17.734 --> 19:20.266
I don't know why they call
that road "expressway,"

19:20.333 --> 19:22.233
'cause the traffic
moves like snails.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.133
Then I managed
to hitch a ride with a trucker,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.433
only we got to talking,
so we missed the exit ramp,

19:26.500 --> 19:28.166
and then he didn't want
to come all the way up here.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.467
Turns out he served four years
for armed robbery,

19:30.533 --> 19:32.066
so I had to walk,

19:32.133 --> 19:34.233
which is why I must look
like yesterday's gumbo.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.300
Here's my resume.

19:36.367 --> 19:38.133
- You always have
this much energy?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.967
- Actually, you caught me
on one of my slow days.

19:41.033 --> 19:43.233
- Congratulations, Floria.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.333
- For what?
- You just got the job.

19:47.367 --> 19:50.700
- I did?
- Yes.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.467
Yeah, I understand

19:57.533 --> 19:58.800
the warden's former assistant
said

19:58.867 --> 20:00.133
we needed food for 20,

20:00.200 --> 20:01.800
but he made a miscalculation,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.166
which I hope
you'll help me correct.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.000
Now, Carl, nothing's impossible.

20:06.066 --> 20:07.834
The governor is gonna
be at the conference,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.333
and you know
if he likes your catering,

20:09.400 --> 20:11.834
you'll be working
state functions for years.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.333
Oh, thank you, Carl.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.433
You're a sweetie.

20:33.567 --> 20:34.700
- Yeah?

20:36.433 --> 20:38.767
- Well, if it's okay,
I'm going home.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.700
- Sure.

20:40.767 --> 20:42.033
Good first day.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.133
- Oh, thanks, I had fun.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.867
- Fun?

20:47.266 --> 20:49.500
"Fun" is not a word
I'd associate with Oz.

20:49.567 --> 20:53.233
- Oh, Warden, have you ever
thought about redecorating?

20:53.300 --> 20:54.633
- Not really.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.367
- Well, with your permission,

20:56.433 --> 20:58.033
I'd like to make a few changes,

20:58.100 --> 21:00.300
brighten things up,
get new furniture.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.533
- Okay.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.033
- Unless, of course,

21:03.100 --> 21:04.800
you think your wife would mind.

21:04.867 --> 21:05.967
I mean, I don't know the woman,

21:06.033 --> 21:07.200
but I know
that there are some wives

21:07.266 --> 21:08.333
who take
their husband's offices

21:08.400 --> 21:09.734
very personally,

21:09.800 --> 21:11.200
if you know what I mean.

21:11.266 --> 21:13.834
- Mary won't mind, Floria.

21:13.900 --> 21:17.500
At this point, she doesn't seem
to care much about what I do.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.333
The fact is...

21:19.400 --> 21:22.633
this morning, my wife and I
decided to separate.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.567
- Oh, Warden, I am so sorry.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.133
- She asked me to move out.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.633
- Do you have somewhere to go?

21:31.700 --> 21:34.233
- No, I hadn't thought about it.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.166
- Well, I'll call you a hotel.

21:36.233 --> 21:38.900
There's a Hyatt right over
on Bartlett and Third.

21:38.967 --> 21:40.500
- Don't bother.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.367
I'm gonna sleep
on this couch tonight.

21:43.433 --> 21:45.367
- Do you think that's wise?

21:46.467 --> 21:49.367
- You know,
this may sound odd, but...

21:49.433 --> 21:54.500
sometimes, the walls around Oz
make me feel safe.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.867
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

21:58.934 --> 22:01.700
I haven't told anybody else.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.066
- Good night, warden.

22:03.133 --> 22:04.467
- Call me Leo.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.633
- You go easy
on that stuff, Leo.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.166
- The warden fired me.

22:18.233 --> 22:19.834
No thank you.
No pat on the back.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.100
Just, "Clear out your desk."

22:21.166 --> 22:23.166
- Well,
maybe it's all for the best.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.166
- Best?

22:24.233 --> 22:25.900
I'm back mopping floors,

22:25.967 --> 22:28.800
scooping up
poop and piss and vomit.

22:28.867 --> 22:30.333
- Do you think I love what I do?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.834
Answering Miss Sally's email?

22:31.900 --> 22:34.667
Forging her autograph
on photos?

22:34.734 --> 22:37.000
I don't think
it matters what we do,

22:37.066 --> 22:38.633
as long as we do our best.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.734
- Oh, Norma, you have the best
perspective on the world.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.834
These past few months,
you coming to visit,

22:46.900 --> 22:48.333
they've meant everything to me.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.533
- I'm glad, Agamemnon.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.133
I want you to be happy.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.500
- When I'm with you,
I'm delirious.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.333
I love you, Norma.

23:00.433 --> 23:01.867
Will you marry me?

23:03.266 --> 23:04.266
- Yes!

23:04.333 --> 23:05.700
- Oh, boy!

23:12.767 --> 23:14.200
- I want you
to be my best man.

23:14.266 --> 23:16.300
- Have you thought this through?

23:16.367 --> 23:18.467
Marriage is a big step,
a big commitment.

23:18.533 --> 23:20.667
What kind of life
can you two have together,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.667
you in here, her out there?

23:22.734 --> 23:24.767
- I won't be in Oz for long.

23:27.734 --> 23:29.000
While you were in the hospital,

23:29.066 --> 23:31.433
I started digging
another tunnel.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.166
You and me, old friend.

23:40.233 --> 23:43.100
We'll dance the hasapiko
at my wedding.

23:45.734 --> 23:49.333
- Saul was a soldier
riding his horse to Damascus

23:49.400 --> 23:52.467
when, all of a sudden,
he saw a huge cross in the sky.

23:52.533 --> 23:56.367
Instantly, he changed the first
letter of his name to "P",

23:56.433 --> 23:57.867
becoming Paul.

23:57.934 --> 23:59.200
Why?

23:59.266 --> 24:00.767
I don't know.

24:00.834 --> 24:04.867
Most of us ain't that lucky,
seeing a cross in the sky.

24:04.934 --> 24:08.934
For most of us, signs from God
aren't quite that clear.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.800
- "Put not God with other gods,

24:11.867 --> 24:15.633
"for thou wilt sit
despised and forsaken.

24:15.700 --> 24:20.633
"Thy Lord has decreed that ye
shall not serve other than him.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.934
And kind"...

24:24.100 --> 24:25.166
What do you want?

24:25.233 --> 24:27.266
- I need to talk
to Minister Said.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.767
- Continue.

24:32.567 --> 24:37.000
- "And kindness towards parents,
whether one or both of them."

24:37.066 --> 24:39.734
- Minister, please.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.300
I want to become a Muslim.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.734
- Tidd.
Go away.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.333
- I know in the past
that I've been fierce,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.500
hanging with Adebisi and stuff.

24:50.567 --> 24:53.500
But when I saw him bleeding

24:53.567 --> 24:56.000
and you with that shank
in your hand,

24:56.066 --> 24:58.033
I knew I had to change.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.000
I want to join you.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.233
- Get up.
- Save me, Minister Said.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.367
- I said get up!
- Hey, hey!

25:06.433 --> 25:08.367
What's going on?

25:08.433 --> 25:10.533
- This man is harassing me.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.300
- You causing trouble, Leroy?
- No.

25:12.367 --> 25:14.266
- Then get your ass gone.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.533
- You know
I never liked Leroy Tidd--

25:29.600 --> 25:33.233
the man's done nothing but flex
since he came into Oz--

25:33.300 --> 25:35.200
but if his conversion is real,
then--

25:35.266 --> 25:36.633
- It's not.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.333
- How do you know for sure?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.166
- Now, you, of all people,

25:42.233 --> 25:45.667
you're gonna question
my ability to judge others?

25:45.734 --> 25:47.000
You?

25:47.066 --> 25:48.600
- No.

25:49.734 --> 25:51.166
Things are as you say they are.

25:51.233 --> 25:53.266
- Good.

25:54.900 --> 25:57.934
And I don't want no more talk
about Leroy Tidd.

26:03.266 --> 26:06.834
- I am a fiend.

26:06.900 --> 26:11.433
I'm also a liar, a thief, a--

26:11.500 --> 26:12.600
I just want
to turn my life backwards,

26:12.667 --> 26:14.166
you know what I mean?

26:14.233 --> 26:17.967
But, 'cause I've been hard,
no one fucking believes me.

26:18.033 --> 26:19.667
- We believe you, Leroy.

26:19.734 --> 26:20.667
Don't we?

26:20.734 --> 26:21.900
- Oh, yeah.

26:21.967 --> 26:24.000
- I believe him.

26:30.033 --> 26:34.200
- This guy, Leroy Tidd,
I think he is genuinely sorry.

26:34.266 --> 26:35.900
I think
he genuinely wants to change.

26:35.967 --> 26:38.367
- And you came
to this conclusion how?

26:38.433 --> 26:40.800
- He was in rehab today.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.500
- Many in Oz have used rehab,

26:43.567 --> 26:46.667
have used Islam
for their own agenda.

26:46.734 --> 26:48.934
Tidd is one of them.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.667
- You've embraced a lot of men
far worse than him.

26:51.734 --> 26:53.800
Jefferson Keane.
Poet. Adebisi.

26:53.867 --> 26:54.800
- No!

26:54.867 --> 26:57.133
Not Adebisi!

27:00.367 --> 27:01.533
- I see.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.200
- Oh, you see?
You see what?

27:03.266 --> 27:06.333
- Tidd hung with Adebisi,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.333
and you feel guilty
about having killed him.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.600
- No.
I do not feel guilt!

27:12.667 --> 27:14.433
I did the right thing.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.467
I did what had to be done.

27:16.533 --> 27:18.800
- Jesus Christ.

27:18.867 --> 27:20.266
That's what I said
about Andrew Schillinger

27:20.333 --> 27:22.200
and Hank Schillinger.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.467
Taking a life is acceptable

27:23.533 --> 27:26.300
as long as it's excusable,
right?

27:26.367 --> 27:28.066
- Beecher.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.567
Get away from me.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.967
- So, he says, "Don't eat me,
eat the nigger."

27:59.834 --> 28:01.433
What's the matter?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.133
You don't think that's funny?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.133
- No.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.767
But you...

28:07.066 --> 28:09.500
You're a joke.

28:14.467 --> 28:15.700
- Whoa!

28:16.834 --> 28:18.500
- Knife! Knife! Knife!

28:22.200 --> 28:24.133
- Ah!

28:24.200 --> 28:26.000
You motherfucking nigger!

28:27.367 --> 28:29.400
Fucker!

28:34.033 --> 28:37.467
- Yo, Schillinger,
I want to talk to you.

28:37.533 --> 28:40.633
- Somebody tell him
that I don't talk to--

28:40.700 --> 28:43.433
what is
the politically correct term--

28:43.500 --> 28:44.633
jungle bunnies.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.667
- Oh, you gonna want
to talk to me.

28:46.734 --> 28:49.100
I saw the dustup between
your pals and the Muslims.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.967
And I know Said's to blame

28:51.033 --> 28:54.633
for your boy Robson spending
a few days down the Hole.

28:54.700 --> 28:59.266
Now, what I'm offering
is to take care of Said.

29:00.734 --> 29:02.800
For the right amount of cash,
of course.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.333
- Will somebody tell him we can
take care of Said ourselves?

29:07.400 --> 29:09.900
We don't need to subcontract.

29:09.967 --> 29:13.934
- Will somebody tell him
I'm gonna get close to Said,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.100
close enough to cut his throat.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.700
- Here. Drink that.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.133
So, the doctor says
everything's okay?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.133
- Yeah.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.967
We did a sonogram.

29:32.033 --> 29:32.967
You want to see?

29:33.033 --> 29:34.400
- Yeah.

29:39.367 --> 29:40.300
God.

29:40.367 --> 29:41.533
- Mr. Schillinger.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.800
I'm worried.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.133
It's been five months.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.133
We still haven't heard
a word from Hank.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.633
- It's like I told you, Carrie,

29:48.700 --> 29:51.266
he just loves to disappear
for long periods of time.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.633
Got the soul of a wanderer.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.400
Just like his mother.

29:56.867 --> 29:59.300
He's gonna be here
when that baby's born.

29:59.367 --> 30:00.800
In the meantime,

30:00.867 --> 30:03.266
I'll get you whatever you need.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.033
- You positive
Hank'll come back?

30:05.100 --> 30:08.000
- I believe it
with all my heart,

30:08.066 --> 30:10.500
and that's what you gotta do.

30:10.567 --> 30:13.000
Okay? You gotta believe.

30:28.734 --> 30:31.333
- Prisoner #00C966.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.100
Jeremiah Cloutier.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.533
Convicted December 27th, 2000.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.367
Embezzlement and petty larceny.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.200
Sentence: nine years.

30:41.266 --> 30:43.800
Up for parole in five.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.467
- He's one of them
TV evangelists.

30:48.533 --> 30:49.734
- One of them?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.867
Until the scandal,
he was bigger than Falwell.

30:51.934 --> 30:54.967
- He cured my sister of leprosy.

30:57.266 --> 30:59.367
- You liar.

30:59.433 --> 31:00.934
- Pneumonia?

31:02.433 --> 31:04.133
- Gentlemen.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.600
Mr. Schillinger?

31:06.667 --> 31:07.867
- Yeah?

31:07.934 --> 31:10.266
- I bring you greetings
from Calvin Anderson.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.333
- Oh, you know Cal?
- Oh, indeed, I do.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.333
When you have some time,
I'd like to talk to you.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.734
- About what?

31:17.800 --> 31:22.867
- Life--
in general, here in Oz.

31:24.066 --> 31:27.500
- Well,
my schedule's pretty clear.

31:27.567 --> 31:29.667
How about right now?

31:29.734 --> 31:31.200
- "Jack came down
out of the beanstalk

31:31.266 --> 31:33.500
"as fast as he could,

31:33.567 --> 31:35.000
"and he ran and he ran

31:35.066 --> 31:37.000
"till he got
to his mother's house.

31:37.066 --> 31:41.000
"Once there,
he gave her the golden harp

31:41.066 --> 31:42.200
"and all the other treasure

31:42.266 --> 31:44.266
"he brought back
from the giant's castle.

31:44.333 --> 31:48.200
And they lived
happily ever after."

31:48.266 --> 31:50.567
- Do you believe
in Jesus Christ?

31:50.633 --> 31:53.533
- Yeah, of course.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.300
- Good.

31:56.767 --> 31:59.033
I want to ask you
another question, Vern.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.000
I'd like you
to answer me honestly.

32:02.266 --> 32:04.033
Are you happy?

32:04.100 --> 32:05.900
- Sure.

32:07.767 --> 32:10.367
- Honestly.

32:10.433 --> 32:11.633
All your life,

32:11.700 --> 32:14.200
you thought that your way
was the right way,

32:14.266 --> 32:17.500
the best way,
the only way.

32:17.567 --> 32:21.533
And yet, as a result,
your wife is dead,

32:21.600 --> 32:25.000
one son dead,
the other missing.

32:25.066 --> 32:29.100
And you are stuck
in this miserable hellhole.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.667
How could any man be happy?

32:35.233 --> 32:39.166
Let the joy of Jesus Christ
fill your heart.

32:39.233 --> 32:43.066
Let him who suffered
take away your suffering.

32:43.133 --> 32:46.166
Open up to the Lord.

32:48.233 --> 32:50.600
- Get your fucking hand off me.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.000
- How's law school, Angus?

32:58.066 --> 33:00.500
- I'm in a constant state
of chasing my own ass.

33:00.567 --> 33:02.100
- I remember that feeling.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.867
- No, I mean, not only do I have
to become the perfect lawyer,

33:04.934 --> 33:07.367
I mean, I have to be
an ideal husband and father.

33:07.433 --> 33:08.934
- Because I fucked it all up.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.433
- Jesus,
that's not what I meant.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.967
- That's the way
Mother and Dad feel,

33:13.033 --> 33:14.300
especially since the kidnapping,

33:14.367 --> 33:16.467
especially since I told them

33:16.533 --> 33:18.133
I was fucking another man.

33:20.734 --> 33:22.166
- Toby, they're old-fashioned.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.000
I mean, none of this
makes any sense to them.

33:24.066 --> 33:27.333
- What, do you think
it makes sense to me?

33:41.266 --> 33:42.500
- Well, let's play the game,

33:42.567 --> 33:44.500
and the category
is "literature,"

33:44.567 --> 33:47.000
and William Shakespeare
once referred to this act

33:47.066 --> 33:50.033
as
"the beast with two backs."

33:50.100 --> 33:51.834
John.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.000
- I'm not real confident
when it comes to Shakespeare,

33:54.066 --> 33:55.900
so I think I need a hint.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.133
- Robert.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.367
- Shakespeare.
Shakespeare.

33:59.433 --> 34:02.200
Isn't that the guy that
made it with Gwyneth Paltrow?

34:03.767 --> 34:06.367
- "The beast with two backs."

34:06.433 --> 34:08.300
- Sex.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.467
- Oh, sex.

34:11.533 --> 34:12.467
Sexual intercourse.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.800
- Hey, Beecher.

34:13.867 --> 34:14.967
That your little brother
I saw you with

34:15.033 --> 34:16.967
in the visiting room?

34:17.033 --> 34:19.066
He's cute.
He fool around?

34:20.867 --> 34:22.633
- The last time I made it,

34:22.700 --> 34:24.967
my girlfriend fell asleep
in the middle.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.000
- Evil-Merodach,
King of Babylon,

34:32.066 --> 34:34.333
in the year that he became king,

34:34.400 --> 34:37.333
released Jehoiachin from prison.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.900
And he spoke kindly to him.

34:40.967 --> 34:45.400
And Jehoiachin took off
his prison clothes,

34:45.467 --> 34:49.000
and he took his meals
with the king

34:49.066 --> 34:51.133
all the days of his life.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.400
- This is bullshit.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.333
- Who said that?

34:56.900 --> 34:57.967
Well, come on, loudmouth.

34:58.033 --> 35:00.266
Have the courage to face me.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.533
- I said it, and it's true.

35:06.934 --> 35:08.300
- Step forward.

35:14.533 --> 35:16.300
What is your name, my friend?

35:16.367 --> 35:17.734
- Jim Burns.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.133
- And why are you in Oz,
Jim Burns?

35:21.200 --> 35:22.633
- They say
I murdered my brother,

35:22.700 --> 35:24.066
but I'm innocent.

35:24.133 --> 35:27.300
- You see before you a sinner.

35:27.367 --> 35:31.166
You see before you
a man possessed by demons,

35:31.233 --> 35:33.600
the demons of fear
and guilt and hate.

35:33.667 --> 35:36.400
I say, demons, be gone.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.166
I cast thee out in the name
of Jesus Christ the savior.

35:39.233 --> 35:40.767
Demons, be gone.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.166
Leave this man!

35:42.233 --> 35:45.166
Sink back into
the eternal fires of damnation!

35:45.233 --> 35:47.166
In the name of God,
I command it!

35:47.233 --> 35:50.266
In the name of God, be gone!

35:56.433 --> 35:58.834
Now, you rise.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.767
Rise up, Jim Burns.

36:01.967 --> 36:04.000
You rise and praise the Lord.

36:04.066 --> 36:05.867
Praise him.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.200
Praise the Lord.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.367
- Praise the Lord!

36:25.367 --> 36:27.467
- "By mercy and truth,
inequity is purged.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.734
and by the fear of the Lord,
men depart."

36:32.367 --> 36:33.800
- May I?

36:33.867 --> 36:35.066
- Please.

36:45.233 --> 36:47.266
- I do want to be happy.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.834
- Come on, what's the scam?

36:54.900 --> 36:56.834
- There is no scam.

36:56.900 --> 36:58.667
- You serious
about going through with this?

36:58.734 --> 37:01.333
- It's been months
since Beecher's kid died.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.834
I kept thinking
he was planning something,

37:02.900 --> 37:05.500
some kind of way to retaliate.

37:05.567 --> 37:06.834
He hasn't done anything.

37:06.900 --> 37:10.166
- Yeah, but you and this prag
sitting together

37:10.233 --> 37:13.200
in one of Sister Pete's
interaction sessions?

37:13.266 --> 37:14.200
That's crazy.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.767
- Why?

37:15.834 --> 37:18.133
I'm just sick
of all this horseshit.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.300
I want to concentrate
on the birth

37:19.367 --> 37:21.633
of my first grandchild.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.433
You know, I just want
a little taste of happiness.

37:24.500 --> 37:28.200
- Vern,
you're starting to scare me.

37:30.867 --> 37:33.467
- Tobias, I believe
that Schillinger is genuine

37:33.533 --> 37:36.133
in wanting to put this ugliness
between you to rest.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.633
- I tried to do that
by finding his son Hank.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.300
What'd I get in return?
My son's dead.

37:41.367 --> 37:43.166
My daughter's traumatized.

37:43.233 --> 37:44.967
- Yeah, but this time,
for the first time,

37:45.033 --> 37:47.967
the need for reconciliation
is coming from Schillinger.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.000
- So what?

37:50.066 --> 37:52.000
This could just be
another one of his plans,

37:52.066 --> 37:53.567
some sort of revenge.

37:54.734 --> 37:57.300
- Well, you'll never know
if we don't try.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.800
- Prisoner #01B784.

38:18.867 --> 38:20.266
Ronald Barlog.

38:20.333 --> 38:23.300
Convicted January 12th, 2001.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.300
Car theft.

38:24.367 --> 38:26.133
Sentence: 13 years.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.300
Up for parole in six.

38:29.367 --> 38:31.734
- This is your sponsor,
Tobias Beecher.

38:31.800 --> 38:35.166
He's gonna help you
acclimate to your new life.

38:35.233 --> 38:37.033
Beecher, this is Ronald Barlog.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.100
- Ronnie.

38:38.166 --> 38:39.767
- Hey.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.867
- All right.
Let's go, Ronnie.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.800
- Holy shit.

38:51.867 --> 38:53.133
Holy fucking shit!
Keller, man.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.667
- Where'd you get
this motherfucker?

38:54.734 --> 38:56.367
Hey, man, how are you doing?
- How you doing?

38:56.433 --> 38:58.000
- Real good.
Real good.

38:58.066 --> 39:00.000
Last time I left you,
at Tommy F's--

39:00.066 --> 39:01.333
- Come on.
- You're screaming for Leila.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.934
"I gotta meet Leila
at the pier."

39:04.000 --> 39:05.834
I'll tell you what, man,
why don't you

39:05.900 --> 39:07.000
get yourself settled,
then we'll catch up?

39:07.066 --> 39:08.834
- All right, cool, cool.
You winning?

39:08.900 --> 39:10.934
- No, I'm getting my ass kicked.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.934
- He's cute.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.567
Does he like to fool around?

39:29.400 --> 39:31.433
- So,
I guess I'm on the bottom?

39:31.500 --> 39:33.800
- Unless you want to be on top.

39:33.867 --> 39:34.800
- No, no.

39:34.867 --> 39:36.567
I'm good with the bottom.

39:42.367 --> 39:43.800
- You knew Keller
on the outside?

39:43.867 --> 39:45.166
- Oh, yeah.

39:45.233 --> 39:48.033
Yeah, we were--
we were partners for awhile.

39:49.533 --> 39:51.200
- You two ever fuck?

39:54.367 --> 39:56.233
- What?

39:58.033 --> 39:59.967
- If you need anything,
you ask, okay?

40:00.033 --> 40:01.734
- Okay.

40:49.266 --> 40:52.700
- Prisoner #01R289.

40:52.767 --> 40:56.533
Burr Redding.
Convicted January 11th, 2001.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.200
Murder in the first degree.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.400
Seven counts
of attempted murder.

41:00.467 --> 41:04.500
Sentence: life without
the possibility of parole.

41:12.567 --> 41:14.333
- Ever since Adebisi died,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.667
the Homeboys have been
in complete disarray.

41:16.734 --> 41:18.600
Redding is just the guy
to galvanize them.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.367
- And you would like me to--

41:20.433 --> 41:22.166
- I would like us both
to gain his confidence,

41:22.233 --> 41:24.900
make him a partner
instead of a foe.

41:24.967 --> 41:27.000
- I'll do what I can.

41:30.066 --> 41:31.533
- Mr. Redding.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.400
I'm Tim McManus.

41:33.467 --> 41:34.667
This is Kareem Said.

41:34.734 --> 41:37.300
- As-salaam alaikum.

41:37.367 --> 41:41.100
- You the cat
that wasted Simon Adebisi.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.700
- Yes, I am.
- Outstanding.

41:45.767 --> 41:49.533
I heard
he was one mean motherfucker,

41:49.600 --> 41:51.934
which makes you even worse.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.166
I guess
I'm gonna have to watch my step.

41:55.233 --> 41:58.033
- I killed Adebisi
in self-defense.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.200
The court exonerated me.

42:00.266 --> 42:01.967
- No doubt.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.867
But motives are less important
than outcome.

42:05.934 --> 42:08.100
He's dead, and you're not.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.633
- May I go now?

42:10.700 --> 42:12.567
- No.

42:12.633 --> 42:14.633
Burr, I think it's important
that you grasp

42:14.700 --> 42:17.166
how things work around here.

42:17.233 --> 42:18.500
- I grew up in the ghetto.

42:18.567 --> 42:20.300
Pops died when I was 10.

42:20.367 --> 42:22.500
I had to quit school,

42:22.567 --> 42:24.500
support my family
by doing some of everything,

42:24.567 --> 42:27.166
from shining shoes
to shooting crap.

42:27.233 --> 42:28.834
I went to Vietnam,
where they taught me

42:28.900 --> 42:32.500
how to kill
small children and women.

42:32.567 --> 42:34.166
I've been in all kinds
of penitentiaries,

42:34.233 --> 42:35.967
from Arizona to Alabama
and back.

42:36.033 --> 42:39.633
And I say all this
not out of pride or shame.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.166
I just want to make sure
that you grasp

42:41.233 --> 42:44.100
that I already grasped
how things work around here.

42:45.667 --> 42:48.266
May I go?

42:48.333 --> 42:50.567
- Yes.

43:00.266 --> 43:02.033
- Yo!

43:04.934 --> 43:07.133
- Augustus.

43:09.100 --> 43:11.700
- Oh, man,
I'm glad you're here, Burr.

43:11.767 --> 43:13.033
- Hmm.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.033
- You know, man,
I ain't glad you're here.

43:15.100 --> 43:17.100
I got it.

43:17.166 --> 43:18.100
Yo, how's Delilah?

43:18.166 --> 43:20.967
- Delilah died, man.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.367
Ovaries went sour on her.

43:23.433 --> 43:25.500
- Oh, man,
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:25.567 --> 43:27.667
- So, lay this situation out
for me.

43:27.734 --> 43:29.333
Who's the players around here?

43:29.400 --> 43:33.333
Which one of these brothers
needs some talkin' to?

43:33.400 --> 43:35.500
- Okay.

43:35.567 --> 43:38.500
First off, there's that dude.

43:38.567 --> 43:41.333
Poet.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.166
- They say since Adebisi died,

43:46.233 --> 43:48.333
you've been running
the Homeboys.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.834
- That's right, man.
That's right.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.934
- They also say
you been doing a shit job.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.400
- Look, old man,
let me tell you something--

43:56.467 --> 43:59.533
- You think
"old man" bothers me?

43:59.600 --> 44:01.033
Boy, I done had
a whole lot of men

44:01.100 --> 44:02.700
tougher than you
that called me worse

44:02.767 --> 44:04.500
didn't make it to old.

44:04.567 --> 44:09.266
My age is my honor
and my strength.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.800
- Shit, you think you can just
come up here and take control?

44:11.867 --> 44:14.867
- Some people are born leaders.
Others are not.

44:14.934 --> 44:18.600
A wise man knows
his own limitations.

44:18.667 --> 44:20.967
You think on that.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.667
- Now,
we got a nice operation going.

44:33.734 --> 44:35.266
- And we don't need you
fucking things up.

44:35.333 --> 44:37.166
- Chucky.

44:37.233 --> 44:38.400
Relax.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.000
Now, we'd value your friendship.

44:42.066 --> 44:44.767
We'd even be willing
to cut you a slice.

44:44.834 --> 44:48.166
- Extremely generous.

44:48.233 --> 44:49.633
I'll get back to you.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.667
- Back to us?

44:51.734 --> 44:55.000
- You take the deal now,
or there is no fucking deal.

44:55.066 --> 44:56.834
- Pancamo. Morales.

44:56.900 --> 45:00.000
I told you dinks before,
this classroom is for classes,

45:00.066 --> 45:01.500
not your board
of directors meetings.

45:01.567 --> 45:03.133
Come on, let's go.

45:04.100 --> 45:05.767
Let's go, move it!

45:05.834 --> 45:06.967
What are you waiting for,

45:07.033 --> 45:08.000
an engraved invitation there,
Redding?

45:08.066 --> 45:10.100
Come on!

45:17.033 --> 45:18.633
- Red, man,
you know them motherfuckers

45:18.700 --> 45:20.300
is plotting against you, right?

45:20.367 --> 45:22.266
- Good,
that's what I want them to do.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.467
- You want them to kill you?

45:24.533 --> 45:28.033
- I want them to try.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.867
- Last night,
a Chinese freighter ran aground

45:33.934 --> 45:35.500
off the Jeb Island Sound.

45:35.567 --> 45:38.000
When the U.S. Coast Guard went
to evacuate the crew,

45:38.066 --> 45:40.500
they discovered
36 illegal aliens

45:40.567 --> 45:41.934
stowed on board.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.166
Until the state department
can determine

45:43.233 --> 45:44.834
the legal status
of the refugees,

45:44.900 --> 45:48.333
the 18 men, 12 women,
and six children will be housed

45:48.400 --> 45:50.367
in various state buildings,

45:50.433 --> 45:52.500
including the Oswald
Correctional Facility.

45:54.233 --> 45:55.667
- Leo, this is insane.

45:55.734 --> 45:57.500
The state's got
40 other prisons.

45:57.567 --> 45:59.500
Put these men somewhere else.

45:59.567 --> 46:01.166
- I got a call
from the secretary of state.

46:01.233 --> 46:02.667
The secretary of state
asked for help.

46:02.734 --> 46:04.166
I'm not inclined to argue.

46:04.233 --> 46:05.500
- What, are you looking
for an appointment

46:05.567 --> 46:06.567
in the new administration?

46:06.633 --> 46:07.834
- Don't be snarky.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.033
- My question is,

46:09.100 --> 46:10.367
where are we gonna house them?

46:10.433 --> 46:11.800
We're on the brink
of overcrowding as it is.

46:11.867 --> 46:14.467
- Well, since this is
a temporary situation,

46:14.533 --> 46:15.967
I thought
we might set up some cots

46:16.033 --> 46:17.700
in the common room
of Emerald City.

46:17.767 --> 46:19.166
- No way.

46:19.233 --> 46:21.300
I have only just reestablished
some order in there.

46:21.367 --> 46:23.300
You're not gonna upset
the apple cart.

46:23.367 --> 46:24.300
- This isn't a matter
for discussion.

46:24.367 --> 46:25.567
We have an emergency,

46:25.633 --> 46:27.934
and everyone, including you,
will bend.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.333
- You mean bend over.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.367
- Tim...

46:31.433 --> 46:34.133
I know from a practical side
that this is a pain,

46:34.200 --> 46:37.333
but we cannot lose sight
of the humanitarian issue.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.100
These men and their families
fled repression in China,

46:41.166 --> 46:43.800
paying a sizable amount of money
to book passage on this boat.

46:43.867 --> 46:45.033
And from what I read
in the papers,

46:45.100 --> 46:47.700
the conditions were worse
than slave ships.

46:47.767 --> 46:49.166
They sailed for months.

46:49.233 --> 46:50.767
They crashed.
They got arrested.

46:50.834 --> 46:52.000
They're separated
from their wives

46:52.066 --> 46:53.000
and their children.

46:53.066 --> 46:55.166
So if we must have them,

46:55.233 --> 46:57.166
let's at least embrace them.

46:57.233 --> 47:00.667
- Warden, this is Gou Liu Xio
from the state department.

47:00.734 --> 47:03.300
- Ms. Gou, pleasure.
- Thank you.

47:03.367 --> 47:06.200
We have the men
in a bus outside.

47:06.266 --> 47:09.000
- Okay, well, let's get them
to receiving and discharge.

47:09.066 --> 47:10.767
- Hi, Tim McManus.

47:10.834 --> 47:12.100
They'll be staying in my unit,

47:12.166 --> 47:13.900
so anything I can do
to make them more comfortable,

47:13.967 --> 47:16.033
you just let me know.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.166
- Excellent.
Come with me.

47:24.533 --> 47:27.800
- I'm not gonna lie to you
and say that life will be easy.

47:30.533 --> 47:31.967
- The prisoners in Oz
are amongst

47:32.033 --> 47:34.133
the most violent criminals
in the country.

47:38.533 --> 47:40.433
- But we have added
extra correctional officers

47:40.500 --> 47:41.900
to the unit,

47:41.967 --> 47:44.433
and they've all been instructed
to watch over you.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.066
- Do any of them speak English?

47:54.066 --> 47:56.000
- I...

47:56.066 --> 47:57.400
- I do.

47:57.467 --> 47:59.000
- Good,
then I'm gonna be relying on you

47:59.066 --> 48:01.834
to help
keep communication going.

48:01.900 --> 48:03.967
- I'm at your service.

48:04.033 --> 48:05.400
- Thank you.

48:05.467 --> 48:07.967
All right, you all need
to follow Officer Armstrong.

48:13.767 --> 48:16.100
- This is America, Gongjin.

48:16.166 --> 48:18.233
Speak English.

48:19.667 --> 48:21.767
- Never volunteer.

48:21.834 --> 48:25.800
- We are in danger
of being sent back to China.

48:25.867 --> 48:27.800
I will do everything I can

48:27.867 --> 48:31.767
to prove that I belong here.

48:34.266 --> 48:35.400
- These people are our guests,

48:35.467 --> 48:37.967
and I expect you
to treat them as such.

48:38.033 --> 48:39.467
If any harm comes to them,

48:39.533 --> 48:41.867
the repercussions
will be severe.

48:41.934 --> 48:44.133
Now, they're gonna
be arriving shortly,

48:44.200 --> 48:45.567
all right,
and until they get familiar

48:45.633 --> 48:47.600
with their new surroundings,

48:47.667 --> 48:50.233
we're gonna put
the rest of you in lockdown.

48:50.300 --> 48:51.533
- Come on, what?

48:51.600 --> 48:52.800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my heart's breaking.

48:52.867 --> 48:54.400
Lockdown, let's go.

48:54.467 --> 48:56.133
Move it!

49:04.333 --> 49:08.166
- So, are you staying
in town tonight?

49:08.233 --> 49:10.000
- Yes.

49:10.066 --> 49:12.767
- Doing anything for dinner?

49:12.834 --> 49:14.734
- Are you asking me out
on a date?

49:14.800 --> 49:17.100
- Oh, no, no,
but we've both gotta eat.

49:17.166 --> 49:19.100
There's a little diner I know,
very informal,

49:19.166 --> 49:20.600
where we could grab
a quick bite.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.467
It's nothing fancy.

49:36.734 --> 49:38.767
- Your grandfather is right.

49:40.367 --> 49:41.934
These are bad men.

49:54.567 --> 49:57.300
- You got a problem with
the cuisine there, Hop Sing?

49:57.367 --> 49:59.100
- No, no.
- Then move along.

49:59.166 --> 50:01.600
You're holding up
my regular customers.

50:07.333 --> 50:10.300
- I wonder how Wanhua
and Jiayu are doing.

50:10.367 --> 50:12.166
- My Suying is tough.

50:12.233 --> 50:14.266
She look after Wanhua.

50:14.333 --> 50:15.500
- But my son--

50:15.567 --> 50:18.333
they put all the children
in the orphanage.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.066
He's never been apart
from us before.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.533
- Hey, guys, this is my table.

50:28.600 --> 50:29.700
- You say what?

50:29.767 --> 50:31.667
- This is my table.

50:31.734 --> 50:33.333
Get your chink asses up,
and move.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.367
Chop, chop.

50:34.433 --> 50:35.500
- Oh, hey!
No, no. Stop.

50:35.567 --> 50:37.867
We're sorry.

50:37.934 --> 50:40.200
- Chucky!

50:40.266 --> 50:43.166
That's no way to treat
these poor fellas.

50:43.233 --> 50:44.800
You their leader?

50:44.867 --> 50:46.300
- Uh, no.

50:46.367 --> 50:47.800
- Well, they listen to you.

50:47.867 --> 50:49.400
- Yes.

50:49.467 --> 50:52.100
- That makes you their leader.

50:52.166 --> 50:54.033
You come and see me.

50:54.100 --> 50:55.567
We'll talk, all right?

50:58.400 --> 51:00.433
Okay.

51:14.200 --> 51:15.333
- Do not go.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.333
- How can I not go?

51:17.400 --> 51:19.133
He's a powerful man.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.500
We may need his help.

51:21.567 --> 51:24.500
- I wish we had never
got on that boat.

51:24.567 --> 51:26.500
I wish
we were in Chengdu right now.

51:26.567 --> 51:28.300
- Stop it.

51:28.367 --> 51:31.600
You watch our crop burn
in the hot sun.

51:33.066 --> 51:34.734
You watch your daughter die.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.700
I cannot do that.

51:37.767 --> 51:40.000
- If they send us back--
- I will not go!

51:40.066 --> 51:43.100
I would rather die
here in America.

51:48.934 --> 51:50.066
Zhuxi.

51:50.133 --> 51:53.233
- Zhuxi?
What does that mean?

51:53.300 --> 51:55.467
- "Chairman," like Mao.

51:56.433 --> 51:57.867
- I love that.

51:57.934 --> 51:59.400
Zhuxi Morales.

52:00.433 --> 52:04.700
- In fact,
it would be "Morales Zhuxi."

52:04.767 --> 52:07.133
The family name is always first.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.133
- See, now,
that's what's fucked up

52:08.200 --> 52:09.834
about your side of the world.

52:09.900 --> 52:11.633
The names.
The way you read.

52:11.700 --> 52:13.000
The funny alphabet.

52:13.066 --> 52:14.734
I mean, you people do
everything backwards.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.900
- Or you people do.

52:18.667 --> 52:20.633
- Right.

52:20.700 --> 52:21.834
Mr. Bian, the reason
I asked to see you

52:21.900 --> 52:24.333
is because I want to warn you.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.834
See that man over there?

52:28.500 --> 52:30.500
- Yes.

52:30.567 --> 52:32.967
- Burr Redding is your enemy.

52:33.033 --> 52:35.834
He hates you
and all your friends.

52:35.900 --> 52:38.333
- Why?

52:38.400 --> 52:39.667
We have done nothing to him.

52:39.734 --> 52:42.500
- Well, he served in Vietnam.

52:42.567 --> 52:44.400
- We are Chinese.

52:44.467 --> 52:46.166
- He don't know the difference.

52:46.233 --> 52:48.767
All he sees is your yellow skin,

52:48.834 --> 52:52.333
and he has vowed to kill
each and every one of you.

52:55.266 --> 52:56.367
- I will go to him.

52:56.433 --> 52:58.600
I will reason with him.

52:58.667 --> 53:01.066
- Does he look like
a reasonable man?

53:02.233 --> 53:05.133
You must kill him.

53:05.200 --> 53:08.700
Not you necessarily,
but one of your men.

53:08.767 --> 53:11.367
- We are simple folk.

53:11.433 --> 53:14.333
Farmer.
Factory worker.

53:14.400 --> 53:18.967
We left China
to escape the killers,

53:19.033 --> 53:20.500
not to become one.

53:20.567 --> 53:23.367
- Then from now on,
I will call you "hombre muerto."

53:23.433 --> 53:25.166
- What is that?

53:25.233 --> 53:26.834
- "Dead man."

53:32.166 --> 53:33.500
- One of the Chinese
came to me

53:33.567 --> 53:34.834
telling me
that you threatened him.

53:34.900 --> 53:36.066
- What are you talking about?

53:36.133 --> 53:37.500
I haven't said two words
to any of them.

53:37.567 --> 53:38.500
- Well,
I've got a lot more reason

53:38.567 --> 53:39.500
to believe him than you,

53:39.567 --> 53:41.333
so I'm gonna tell you something.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.166
Anything happens,
anything at all,

53:43.233 --> 53:45.000
I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible.

53:45.066 --> 53:46.233
- That's bullshit.

53:46.300 --> 53:47.800
- Regardless,
that's the way it is.

53:47.867 --> 53:50.900
You steer clear, you understand?

53:53.900 --> 53:55.667
- That's wonderful.

53:55.734 --> 53:58.333
Have you heard from Jiayu?

53:58.400 --> 54:03.033
Tell him that--
that I love him.

54:03.100 --> 54:07.200
And... Wanhua...

54:07.266 --> 54:09.633
I love you too.

54:12.033 --> 54:14.600
Okay.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.633
- How does she sound?
- She miss me.

54:20.700 --> 54:23.467
She say Suying
is bossing everyone around.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.467
- Thank you
for the phone call, Zhuxi.

54:27.533 --> 54:28.667
- It's the least I can do.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.567
- Work detail!

54:32.633 --> 54:34.100
- What is that?

54:34.166 --> 54:35.800
- Oh, we all have jobs to do.

54:36.900 --> 54:39.333
- Oh, I would like to work.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.867
- Yeah?
- You sure?

54:40.934 --> 54:44.734
- I would.
I want to do my part.

54:44.800 --> 54:47.200
- Okay.
Let me go talk to some people.

54:47.266 --> 54:48.667
- Okay.

55:03.066 --> 55:05.500
- What's going on, "Oo-see"?

55:05.567 --> 55:08.834
- "Ee-shoo-ay."
- Yixue, sorry.

55:08.900 --> 55:10.100
Not that I'll need to know

55:10.166 --> 55:11.567
how to pronounce your name
for much longer.

55:11.633 --> 55:13.433
- What--

55:13.500 --> 55:14.967
what is going on?

55:15.033 --> 55:16.166
- Well, you see, Yixue,

55:16.233 --> 55:18.000
you've done everything
I needed you to do,

55:18.066 --> 55:19.800
and I'm grateful,

55:19.867 --> 55:22.967
but there's just one last thing
I must ask of you.

55:23.033 --> 55:24.934
- What?
What's that?

55:26.867 --> 55:27.934
- Die.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.800
- My wife.
My son.

55:33.867 --> 55:35.166
- They will mourn you.

55:35.233 --> 55:36.166
Forever.

55:59.734 --> 56:01.633
- I warned you.

56:03.533 --> 56:04.800
- What?

56:04.867 --> 56:07.233
- Put him in the cage.
- What the fuck for?

56:07.300 --> 56:08.734
- Come on, let's go.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.200
- What the fuck's going on
in here?

56:10.266 --> 56:11.800
- Come on!
Move it!

56:11.867 --> 56:14.433
- Oh, you motherfucker.

56:14.500 --> 56:15.700
- Come on.

56:17.200 --> 56:18.500
Come on.

56:18.567 --> 56:19.667
Get--

56:22.533 --> 56:24.400
Get the fuck in there!

56:25.867 --> 56:28.333
- Open up the goddamn door!

56:28.400 --> 56:29.333
Open it up!

56:31.266 --> 56:33.166
No! No!

56:33.233 --> 56:35.300
Argh!

56:35.367 --> 56:38.800
- Any convert, whether he goes
from communist to capitalist

56:38.867 --> 56:41.633
or from six packs a day
to smoke-free,

56:41.700 --> 56:44.033
ends up condemning
his former practices.

56:44.100 --> 56:45.667
Because those beliefs
didn't work for him,

56:45.734 --> 56:47.667
they can't work for anybody.

56:47.734 --> 56:51.033
His vision becomes narrow,
blinded by the light.

56:51.100 --> 56:52.834
Whether
he's transformed into a Hindu

56:52.900 --> 56:56.533
or joins AA,
he becomes a fanatic.

56:56.600 --> 56:58.166
If you ask me,

56:58.233 --> 57:00.667
it's the fanatics
who fuck up the world.

57:00.734 --> 57:04.100
It's the fanatics who think
they got God on their side.

57:04.166 --> 57:05.333
The rest of us?

57:05.400 --> 57:07.166
We don't need divine light.

57:07.233 --> 57:08.667
In the dark of night,

57:08.734 --> 57:10.433
all we want is enough light

57:10.500 --> 57:14.100
so that we don't stub our toe
on the way to the toilet.
