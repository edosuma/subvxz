00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.640 --> 00:12.245
Six years ago,
the Geordie Squad first got together.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.650
But it's not all been one big party.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.652
Back to work.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.389
We've had to work
for that wrinkly fuck Anna.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.726
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.295
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:31.231 --> 00:34.200
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:35.402 --> 00:38.438
So now the squad is expanding.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.107
Oi, oi!
Hello!

00:41.174 --> 00:44.077
(cheering)

00:49.416 --> 00:52.519
I'm not gonna be able
to keep all yous all on full time.

00:52.585 --> 00:57.991
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.529
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.595 --> 01:05.298
Are they fucking radge enough...

01:05.364 --> 01:08.067
To join this crazy family?

01:14.107 --> 01:15.742
Let wor fuckin gan.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.811
(phone rings)
Hello?

01:17.877 --> 01:21.815
I've got to tell some of the newbies
that they've got to leave.

01:21.881 --> 01:26.152
Billy, Eve, Chelsea, unfortunately
you have to pack your bags.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.722
I haven't got the sack!
Fucking buzzing!

01:29.789 --> 01:32.225
To the new and formed family!

01:32.292 --> 01:34.594
These newbies
are now part of the team.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.331
Fuck me, Elettra is fit.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.270
I can do nothing if people
want to kiss me. I am beautiful.

01:45.805 --> 01:46.906
Why is she saying it?

01:46.973 --> 01:49.476
I thought she had a boyfriend
and she was happy.

01:52.612 --> 01:56.983
It's obvious that there's unfinished
business between them two.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.218
Wow.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.387
Nee chance of doin' nowt now
with Chloe and me ex-bird.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.491
I'm glad we're still mates.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.527
Me and Marty in the shower
in a non-sexy way,

02:07.594 --> 02:11.531
checking each other's bits out.
But everyone does it, it's normal!

02:12.866 --> 02:14.567
Shit's about to get real.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.338
I do have some news
for the new workers.

02:18.404 --> 02:21.374
I'm not going to be able
to keep yous all on full time.

02:21.441 --> 02:22.976
Oh, my God.

02:23.042 --> 02:26.946
Shit. If this isn't over,
what's happening next?

02:29.048 --> 02:30.984
I should have a degree in pulling.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.319
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.055
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.491
Get me in.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.627
I'm preened to perfection.

02:40.693 --> 02:43.029
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.865
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.801
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:48.868 --> 02:52.906
My quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.974
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:02.048 --> 03:05.685
# I have never been to France
# I have never been to France

03:05.752 --> 03:09.188
# I'm not wearing underpants
# I'm not wearing underpants #

03:09.255 --> 03:13.960
Oh, my God, Anna has sent us skiing
in France, for work!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.728
What a belter!

03:15.795 --> 03:17.997
I hope there's chicken
nuggets in France.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.533
They don't eat chicken,
they have frogs.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.168
Frog nuggets?
Frog nuggets.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.970
Eh?
And chips.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.206
And chips?!
What a fucking awful combination!

03:29.576 --> 03:31.244
Skiing, you don't understand.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.247
I've never been before.
It's my favourite holiday.

03:34.314 --> 03:38.284
Anna is sending the original squad
to Tignes in the French Alps

03:38.351 --> 03:41.187
to do some more Geordie Tours events
in the snow.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.757
I can't wait.
I love getting on the piste.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.726
I wonder who's coming back.

03:46.793 --> 03:50.330
She rang me and didn't mention
anything to do with the newbies.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.066
She said she's got
a massive decision to make.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.469
Anna's not told us whether any
of the newbies are coming or not.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.105
I hope they are.
Not because they do all the work,

03:59.172 --> 04:01.307
I actually got used to them
being around.

04:03.876 --> 04:07.413
Skiing, skiing, skiing!

04:07.480 --> 04:09.849
"Please leave your message
after the tone."

04:09.916 --> 04:15.888
Hi, Marns! I'm on me way to the
airport, I am absolutely buzzing.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.257
Anna sent Marnie on a job
back in Newcastle,

04:18.324 --> 04:20.692
so she won't be in France
for a few days,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
but I can't wait
to get to the airport

04:22.829 --> 04:25.565
and meet the rest
of the crazy bloody bunch.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.968
Make sure you pack your thermals!
Love you. See you soon.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.538
I don't know what's going on.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.241
What's easier
is me and Marnie not talking.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.244
It's hard living with Marnie
when she has a boyfriend.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.481
So, a few days in France without her
won't do me any harm.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.983
As far as I'm concerned,
we're on the pull.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.320
Gaz wingman, Marty,
and we'll just fucking go beserk.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.423
Marnie fucks Aaron's head.
He's better off without her.

04:50.490 --> 04:54.060
The only girl I want to see
is me Italian princess Elettra.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.629
Hopefully we can rekindle our love.

05:01.668 --> 05:05.705
(squealing)
Nathan, man!

05:05.772 --> 05:08.307
(laughter)

05:08.374 --> 05:11.744
Oggy, oggy, oggy!
Hey!

05:11.811 --> 05:14.347
The squad is back together

05:14.414 --> 05:17.817
and I can't believe Anna
has sent us to France for work.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.585
I've never been skiing before!

05:26.693 --> 05:29.262
(cheering)

05:29.328 --> 05:31.497
Oh, my God!

05:31.564 --> 05:35.768
(Sophie) We arrive in Tignes.
It's like Christmas all year round!

05:35.835 --> 05:40.039
I have never seen something
so beautiful in all my life!

05:40.106 --> 05:43.810
No, Gary! We've only been here
two seconds, man.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.045
There's snow everywhere.

05:46.112 --> 05:49.182
It's like a big French man
has cum all over the mountain.

05:49.248 --> 05:53.186
Come on, lads, get in!
(cheering)

05:53.252 --> 05:54.754
The three ugly sisters.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.692
There's some big chalets there.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.461
I'm fucking buzzing to be here.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.763
I can't wait to get
to where we're staying.

06:03.830 --> 06:07.366
I just hope Anna hasn't stitched
wor up and put wor in an igloo.

06:09.235 --> 06:12.338
(cheering)
Oh, my days!

06:12.405 --> 06:14.040
This chalet is unbelievable.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.176
I cannot believe we're being
trusted in a place like this.

06:17.243 --> 06:19.479
Anna's head
must have fell clean off!

06:19.545 --> 06:21.180
Look at that pool in there!

06:21.247 --> 06:24.083
There's a pool, mate!
Whoa!

06:28.888 --> 06:31.057
Wow!
Yous, hurry up!

06:31.124 --> 06:32.959
This chalet is unbelievable.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.329
We've got a pool table,
a bar, a hot tub.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.465
Anna, we must be making you
a fucking fortune.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.801
Oh, my God, are you kidding?!

06:41.868 --> 06:44.570
Oh, my God,
these stairs are so scary!

06:47.807 --> 06:49.542
Yous, there's a bedroom up here!

06:49.609 --> 06:52.578
(cheering, shouting)

06:52.645 --> 06:54.947
I am so buzzing
there's a car in me room.

06:55.014 --> 06:59.252
This just means I can practice
more for my driving test. Get in!

07:04.824 --> 07:07.960
Oh, my God,
look at all the ski stuff!

07:08.027 --> 07:09.762
I want the white one!

07:09.829 --> 07:12.298
We all come back downstairs
into the main room

07:12.365 --> 07:15.334
and in the corner there's
a mannequin with a ski suit on.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.170
That's freaking me clean out!

07:17.236 --> 07:20.039
(talking over each other)

07:20.106 --> 07:21.841
Oh! The mannequin's moving!

07:21.908 --> 07:24.477
(shouting, screaming)

07:24.544 --> 07:28.881
Oh, my god!
It's not a mannequin, it's Scott!

07:28.948 --> 07:30.616
(laughing, cheering)

07:30.683 --> 07:33.586
Guess who's back?
That's right, it's Scotty Turbo T.

07:33.653 --> 07:36.322
All the way from the Toon
with his big baguette!

07:36.389 --> 07:39.225
(laughter, cheering)

07:39.292 --> 07:41.527
I am just buzzing Scott is back.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.597
We missed him and it's going
to make this trip better.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.732
Who the fuck is missing, like?
Marnie!

07:46.799 --> 07:48.701
Don't worry, she'll be here soon.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.437
The big news is
Anna needs new workers

07:51.504 --> 07:54.140
and we've been putting
the newbies to the test!

07:54.207 --> 07:56.509
We've had to put them
through their paces.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.244
Geordie Tours, in other words.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.581
Then went down to five, so we
dunno who is coming and who's not.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.984
We dunno who's coming back.
You woulda loved some of the girls.

08:05.051 --> 08:08.054
New birds, like?!
I'll shag 'em straight away.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.522
New birds? Well, aye.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.425
Don't worry, I'll put them
right through their paces

08:12.491 --> 08:14.627
and me cock straight in their faces.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.364
To Scott getting back!
(cheering)

08:18.431 --> 08:19.832
To me!

08:21.067 --> 08:22.902
More!

08:22.969 --> 08:25.304
I know we're here for work
but work can wait.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.608
Scott's back and I'm desperate
to hit the slopes and have fun.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.243
Help us, I'm too fat.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.614
I can't believe me and Nathan
have got matching ski outfits.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.883
We look like Tweedledum
and Tweedletwat!

08:38.049 --> 08:40.152
Oh, my God. Walk, babe. Walk.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.023
Come on, lads and lasses!

08:44.090 --> 08:46.259
(cheering)

08:46.325 --> 08:49.795
I look pure lethal, me.
Let's fucking go!

08:55.935 --> 08:58.204
Fuck's sake, man!

08:59.038 --> 09:01.507
Which one?
Hi. Hello.

09:01.574 --> 09:05.878
Hello, who's that, like?
It's our skiing teacher, bonjour!

09:05.945 --> 09:08.481
Can you understand Geordie?
Geordie, yeah.

09:08.547 --> 09:11.984
Can you understand pussy?
I can understand pussy too.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.587
Where's the pussy-pussy cat, yeah?

09:14.654 --> 09:17.423
You're a pussy cat!
Oh, he's flirting!

09:17.490 --> 09:18.491
Oh, my God!

09:18.557 --> 09:21.661
The skiing teacher may be fit,
but howay, honey,

09:21.727 --> 09:23.996
I do not need skiing lessons.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.132
Fuck this, I'm going down.

09:26.198 --> 09:29.001
(shouts)

09:29.068 --> 09:32.972
Oh, my God. Sophie, move, please.
I don't know how to stop it.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.573
Fuck, I can't stop!

09:34.640 --> 09:36.442
And it's getting faster!

09:36.509 --> 09:39.245
I'm going to die.
I'm going to fall. I can't stop.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.347
Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!

09:41.414 --> 09:43.182
Help! No... Move!

09:43.249 --> 09:44.250
Help!

09:50.957 --> 09:52.158
Aaron!

09:52.224 --> 09:55.361
All the big boys
are going up the top of the slope.

09:55.428 --> 09:59.665
There is no way I am staying
on the baby slopes.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.170
Whoa!
Oh, ya! Shit.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.172
The ski game isn't for me.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.474
I've ended up on my ass
all the way down.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.346
I love being up on the mountain
with the lads,

10:13.412 --> 10:16.549
but it's time to fill Scott in
about the job Anna's given us

10:16.615 --> 10:19.418
to help her find
the best new workers.

10:19.485 --> 10:22.421
I need to know, you know,
if there's newbies come in,

10:22.488 --> 10:24.323
someone must have fucked someone.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.492
No-one did!
Fuck off!

10:26.559 --> 10:28.761
What's the order of the fittest?
Sarah.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.464
No, Elettra was fitter.
Abbie and Zahida.

10:31.530 --> 10:35.735
I'll shag Zahida, sack her off,
shag Sarah, sack her off

10:35.801 --> 10:38.104
and then
let the fucking dramas commence.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.538
I'll sit there and laugh.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.574
All Scott gives a shit about

10:41.640 --> 10:44.810
is which of the newbies
he can get in the shag pad.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.513
He'll be more successful
than Aaron and Marty.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.387
Is it still going on?!
She's still flirting.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.123
You're still taking it,
you need to go on the pull!

10:57.189 --> 10:59.558
Me and Marns
still have a strong connection.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.628
We always will, but fuck,
it's hard living with your ex.

11:02.695 --> 11:06.665
So, while she's not here, going back
on the pull is exactly what I need.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.167
Anyway, enough of this.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.469
Last one down...
Buys the pints.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.304
Get the pints in tonight!

11:15.708 --> 11:19.078
Snowboarding has been sick,
but my dick is going to drop off.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.213
Let's get back to the chalet,
get warm

11:21.280 --> 11:23.682
and get my fucking
clothes on for tonight.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.256
Who wants hot chocolate, man?

11:30.322 --> 11:33.959
We're back at the chalet and I've
decided to make hot chocolate.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.728
Fucking yay!

11:35.795 --> 11:38.931
To be fair, as good as first days
go, that's been hard to top.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.933
Unreal chalet, Scott surprised us.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.335
And going out tonight, mate, yessa!

11:43.402 --> 11:45.771
In Newcastle we had newbies
living with us,

11:45.838 --> 11:49.842
but Anna has just sent us skiing
and I love everything about it.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.445
I love having
the original family back.

11:52.511 --> 11:56.582
(phone rings)
Phone! Someone get it!

11:56.649 --> 11:57.883
Hallo!

11:57.950 --> 12:01.821
The phone rings and only one radgie
has got this number, fucking Anna.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.324
Bonjour!
"Hello, Scotty."

12:05.391 --> 12:08.828
"Nice to have you back."
Hello, darling. How are you doing?

12:08.894 --> 12:13.165
It was only a matter of time before
Anna ruined the fucking day

12:13.232 --> 12:15.134
and now she's on the phone.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.170
"Scott, if you're with the others,
put me on speaker,

12:18.237 --> 12:21.574
because I've got something
really important to say."

12:21.640 --> 12:24.510
What the fuck has Anna
got planned for us this time?

12:27.913 --> 12:31.050
If I'm not careful,
my fanny's gonna get frostbite.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.018
Let's have a fucking wicked night.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.187
I'm going to get pure peevy!

12:35.254 --> 12:37.490
(cheering)

12:37.556 --> 12:39.959
The newbies have arrived in Tignes.
Oi, oi!

12:40.025 --> 12:41.961
I asked Scott not to kiss Sarah.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.864
Scott has already got
his tongue in me throat!

12:46.031 --> 12:48.834
Marty looks like he wants to fight.
Me and you, Scott.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.837
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:55.007 --> 12:55.207
.

12:57.710 --> 12:57.910
.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.719
Bonjour!

13:06.785 --> 13:09.989
We're all in the chalet
and Anna's on the phone

13:10.055 --> 13:12.258
saying she's got some big news
for us.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.326
Oh, God, what now?

13:14.393 --> 13:17.062
"The new workers
will be joining you later,

13:17.129 --> 13:19.798
but I've made a tough decision."

13:19.865 --> 13:24.637
"Elettra won't be coming. I don't
think she's right for the job."

13:24.703 --> 13:26.372
Ahh.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.807
Marty's been grafting
Elettra for ages.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.043
It sucks to be you, Marty.
Too bad, kid.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.013
Martin's heartbroken.
Anna, how could you?

13:34.079 --> 13:36.282
Me and that Italian had a connection.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.285
She was probably going to marry us!
Devastated.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.621
"Oh, and one more thing, Scott.
You've got work tomorrow."

13:42.688 --> 13:47.826
"I need you to test out the Geordie
Tours bonding experience for me,

13:47.893 --> 13:51.664
but tonight, you've got
the night off. Night, night!"

13:51.730 --> 13:56.068
Bye! Slag. Whatever happens, happens.
Let's just have a wicked night.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.703
Yeah, bro!

13:57.770 --> 14:00.806
I cant wait to see Abbie,
Sarah, Zahida and Sam,

14:00.873 --> 14:05.444
but I need to get ready for tonight
because I'm going to get pure peevy!

14:15.154 --> 14:17.056
Do you want to learn some French?

14:17.122 --> 14:19.458
Go on, then.
J'adore le cock.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.559
I love cock.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.661
What about this one? Guten Tag!

14:22.728 --> 14:25.297
Voulez vous coucher avec... wa.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.399
Wanna bug us?
Wanna come to bed with me?

14:27.466 --> 14:30.569
All this dirty French talk
is making me proper horny,

14:30.636 --> 14:33.539
but luckily I came prepared.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.809
I'm not being funny, I'm actually
going to use it in the house.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.645
Oh, my God!
Where do you put that?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.013
Straight up my bum!

14:41.080 --> 14:43.048
I've got something
you need to say...

14:43.115 --> 14:44.650
Oh, God, it smells like shit.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.652
No, it doesn't.
Smell it!

14:46.719 --> 14:49.288
That's a lie, give me my dick back!

14:51.557 --> 14:54.159
I'm dying to pull.
Haven't pulled for a while.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.328
Not being funny right but, like,

14:56.395 --> 14:59.798
these skiing fucking turfs
are full of posh fanny.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.600
(laughter)

15:01.667 --> 15:04.236
I've been away too long
and I've missed the boys,

15:04.303 --> 15:05.804
but enough of the shit chat.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.240
I want to get out
and get off my fucking dish!

15:10.009 --> 15:13.345
Everyone ready for the first night?
(cheering)

15:13.412 --> 15:16.649
It's the first night in Tignes
and I'm buzzing Scotty is back.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.518
It's a family night
and I cannot wait to get mortal.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.088
Tonight is going to be fucking mint.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.662
Whoa, Marty!
What the fuck are you doing?

15:29.728 --> 15:32.064
I am a Geordie girl
so no matter where I go,

15:32.131 --> 15:36.602
I will always take me short dresses,
me big boots and me hair extensions.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.639
So, fuck you, slopes. I'm gonna be
wearing my heels to the club.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.379
We get to the club,
the drinks are there, we're here.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.049
What else are we going to do?
Get fucked!

15:59.325 --> 16:00.926
(cheering)

16:00.993 --> 16:04.430
It's my first night back
and it's going to go off the mop!

16:12.871 --> 16:15.407
I'm buzzing for tonight
cos Scott's here

16:15.474 --> 16:17.943
and it's been a while
since I've been with him.

16:18.010 --> 16:21.814
It's just a shame that Marnie won't
be here to enjoy it with the family.

16:30.389 --> 16:34.259
One thing you shouldn't do when
you're pissed is talk about your ex,

16:34.326 --> 16:36.762
but here I am,
talking to Sophie about Marnie.

16:43.802 --> 16:46.739
Even though Marnie's moved on,
I don't think Aaron has.

16:46.805 --> 16:50.109
I don't know if he's going to be
able to live with her as friends.

16:59.118 --> 17:02.488
I'm talking to Marty and
after everything we've been through,

17:02.554 --> 17:05.891
we're finally at a place where
we can be friends and not argue.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.326
It feels so good.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.065
When me and Chloe are getting on,
I do love her.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.733
I want it to stay that way.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.583
We're having a wicked first night.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.319
All we need now is the newbies
to hurry up and join us

17:34.386 --> 17:36.555
so we can take the party
to the next level.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.366
We're back.
The newbies have arrived in Tignes.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.335
They didn't think they'd get
rid of us that easily.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.238
Hello!

17:53.305 --> 17:55.974
(cheering)

17:56.041 --> 17:59.611
(Sam) We've rocked up to the club.
They're all buzzing to see us.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.814
Thank fuck Anna
didn't give us the boot,

18:01.880 --> 18:06.084
because being in France with
this lot is going to be a frisk!

18:07.553 --> 18:12.291
The newbies are here and I'm glad
Sam's back, cos my hair needs a trim.

18:16.728 --> 18:19.031
These must be the newbies. Hello!

18:29.775 --> 18:33.011
I'm buzzing that the four of us
made it out to Tignes.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.380
Anna has been brutal.

18:35.447 --> 18:39.318
Even though we're not safe, let's
forget it and have a mint night.

18:48.527 --> 18:51.196
I don't know whether
it's the altitude or peeve,

18:51.263 --> 18:55.434
but I fancy a snuggle tonight
and me ex Sarah is looking fit.

19:00.105 --> 19:04.109
Sorry, Marty, I've got me eye
on someone else tonight. Scott.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.092
The minute I saw Scott,
I fancied him.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.294
I've definitely got my eye on him.

19:31.803 --> 19:35.841
Abbie has told us she fancies Scott,
but I'm looking over

19:35.908 --> 19:38.644
and from what I can see,
Sarah's beat her to it.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.682
Scott has got his tongue
in the back of me throat.

19:43.749 --> 19:47.886
I am buzzing, but I think Marty
is going to be a bit foaming.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.655
I don't care if it's Marty's ex.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.357
If he's got anything to say,
I'll shag him and all!

19:52.424 --> 19:54.259
How do you like them apples, mate?

19:54.326 --> 19:56.361
Oi, oi!

19:56.428 --> 20:01.133
I'm asking Scott very politely
and very nicely not to kiss Sarah,

20:01.199 --> 20:03.936
cos I don't know what that fuck
is going on in my head.

20:07.706 --> 20:11.176
Why is Marty trying to get
involved with Scott and Sarah?

20:11.243 --> 20:12.911
It's got nothing to do with him.

20:19.117 --> 20:21.219
After what I've just said to Scott,

20:21.286 --> 20:24.623
he's walked straight over to Sarah
and started talking to her.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.693
What the fuck are you saying, mate?
You are a shit bag.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.699
I can't believe that Marty
tried to kick Scott.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.802
I knew these two would start arguing
once they had a drink.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.204
Both of them
think with their fucking dicks.

20:39.271 --> 20:42.641
(whistles)
Let's go! Let's go! Everyone!

20:42.708 --> 20:46.812
I can't believe Sarah has beat me
to Scott, but I can wait for him.

20:46.878 --> 20:50.882
I just want to get back to wherever
we're staying and get some scran.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.658
We get back to the chalet
and I'm pure mortal.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.059
It's minus 20 degrees.

21:01.126 --> 21:04.496
If I'm not careful
my fanny is gonna get frostbite.

21:04.563 --> 21:05.664
Ah!

21:10.736 --> 21:15.540
I can smell the chlorine!
Where's the scran?

21:15.607 --> 21:18.410
We arrive at the chalet
and it's unreal.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.813
I wonder how long it's going to be
before it gets trashed.

21:27.719 --> 21:32.024
Bon appetit, radgies.
Here's a flash of my fanny.

21:32.090 --> 21:37.029
Get your rat out, get your rat out,
get your rat out for the kitchen!

21:37.095 --> 21:40.132
Howay, man, Chloe, you're putting us
clean off me pizza.

21:40.198 --> 21:43.068
It's time for me to go to bed
and you're coming too.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.373
Tonight has been
absolutely... (burps) ...amazing.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.708
Goodnight!

21:54.946 --> 21:58.984
I told him, right, when Sarah walked
in, I said, "Don't get with her."

21:59.051 --> 22:01.319
Marty, it's not your bird though,
is it?

22:01.386 --> 22:03.989
All Marty is talking about
is Scott and Sarah.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.925
Why does he give a fuck?
Them two are not together.

22:10.128 --> 22:14.766
Yeah, fight him now then.
Fight him then, fight him now.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.436
Let's go.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.040
Me and you Scott, here.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.644
Marty's bouncing down the stairs
like he wants a fight. Is he radge?

22:25.711 --> 22:29.114
I've got better things to do. Whack
me cock in his ex bird's mouth!

22:30.882 --> 22:35.287
I wouldn't waste my time.
Listen, I wouldn't. Why? What for?

22:35.353 --> 22:38.857
Marty can have all the stupid
little kick-offs that he wants.

22:38.924 --> 22:42.260
It doesn't bother us,
cos I know it's about his pride.

22:42.327 --> 22:45.530
You can't do it, mate. Calm down.

22:46.531 --> 22:50.268
Tonight has been fucking shit.
I cannot be fucked with this.

22:50.335 --> 22:51.503
I'm going to sleep.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.478
If you didn't want us
to sleep in the same room,

22:59.544 --> 23:02.547
I'll sleep with me face
between your ex's bum cheeks.

23:02.614 --> 23:04.716
Sweet dreams, you mug.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.718
(giggling)

23:08.920 --> 23:11.590
(giggling)

23:14.760 --> 23:16.495
This is what it's all about.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.164
If you want my advice,
don't get with anyone.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.801
Sorry, Marty,
if I wanna get with Scott, I will.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.270
Anna, are you trying
to fucking kill us?

23:27.272 --> 23:30.575
I might crack on with Abbie.
She looks worthy of the pipe.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.812
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:36.481 --> 23:36.681
.

23:39.184 --> 23:39.384
.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.991
'You have been warned.'

23:48.593 --> 23:50.929
(yawning)

23:53.598 --> 23:55.534
Our first night in Tignes was wicked

23:55.600 --> 23:57.736
and I've woken up
with Scotty T in me bed.

24:04.509 --> 24:08.146
Good morning,
you little fucking radge packets.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.681
(muffled shouting)

24:11.016 --> 24:14.252
Is there any need for that gob?

24:14.319 --> 24:16.021
Good morning, Nathan!

24:16.087 --> 24:18.857
Last night was mint,
but I don't remember much.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.058
Typical Chloe!

24:20.125 --> 24:24.296
I woke up at one point
to you on top of the car,

24:24.362 --> 24:28.200
full on naked, like a foetus,
peeling a banana.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.869
What, are you lying?
And you carried on. Alone!

24:30.936 --> 24:32.204
I was alone?!

24:32.270 --> 24:34.406
And you were going na, na, na.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.608
I've taken things
to a whole new level.

24:36.675 --> 24:40.478
Drunken monkey antics.
What the hell went on?

24:40.545 --> 24:42.781
What was going on
with Marty and Scott?

24:42.848 --> 24:46.852
He was all over Sarah and then Marty
started getting jealous.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.588
It's like, Marty,
you do not care about Sarah.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.523
He's such a liar.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.826
I'm so glad I'm not stuck
in Scott and Marty's argument.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.695
For once me and Marty are friends,

24:56.761 --> 25:01.066
so that means me and him
are gonna have no drama. Result!

25:02.601 --> 25:04.536
Oh, my goodness, there's a dent!

25:04.603 --> 25:06.504
Oh, my God, you fat bitch!

25:08.473 --> 25:10.742
My girl Sarah
was on form last night.

25:10.809 --> 25:14.679
Martin and Scott were fighting over
her and I wanna know all the goss.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.848
What's the crack with Scott?

25:16.915 --> 25:21.186
We just kind of, like...
had a little cuddle.

25:22.287 --> 25:25.323
I wasn't gonna dust him on night one.
You know what I mean?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.926
I've woke up
feeling a little bit smug.

25:27.993 --> 25:31.596
Not gonna lie, it's nice to have
attention from two lads at once.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.332
Abbie's got her eye
on Scott as well.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.534
Nowt to do with me.
I'm not gonna tell her

25:36.601 --> 25:39.004
who she can get with,
but she's my mate so...

25:39.070 --> 25:42.774
I hope Sarah's right
and Abbie respects girl code.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.777
At the end of the day,
we're still on trial for Anna.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.446
The last thing
us newbies need is any drama.

25:48.513 --> 25:51.516
I do actually like him, y'know.

25:58.790 --> 25:59.891
Do you want a cuddle?

25:59.958 --> 26:03.228
I want you to explain yourself
cos you were a dick last night.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.397
I'm gonna blame it on the altitude.

26:05.463 --> 26:06.498
(laughter)

26:06.564 --> 26:09.301
I might have been a dick,
but if you ask Scott not to go

26:09.367 --> 26:12.704
and pull your ex and he's
done it anyway, you'd be pissed off.

26:12.771 --> 26:15.540
It's one person
you don't want Scott to get with.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.375
I know.
Do you know what I mean?

26:17.442 --> 26:19.844
If you're the ex,
get with anyone but not him.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.747
Gaz is right, if Scott tried
to crack on with Marnie

26:22.814 --> 26:25.116
I would hit the fucking roof.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.685
Morning.
Give us a cuddle.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.588
I did kick off
with Scott last night,

26:30.655 --> 26:33.558
but I haven't come to Tignes
to be fighting all the time.

26:33.625 --> 26:37.228
I'm just gonna give him a cuddle
and brush it under the carpet.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.731
How was your night, then?
It was good crack.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.533
Did you shag her?
No.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.702
Ah!

26:43.768 --> 26:47.505
The problem is with Marty and Scott
is they will compete for anything

26:47.572 --> 26:50.842
or anyone. All they wanna do
is get one over on each other.

26:54.245 --> 26:57.682
I necked on with Sarah last night,
but there's only one turbo dick

26:57.749 --> 27:00.185
and I'm thinking
I might crack on with Abbie.

27:00.251 --> 27:02.053
She looks worthy of the pipe.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.056
The world is your oyster.
Oyster.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.093
Scott will never change.
He can never stick to one bird.

27:08.159 --> 27:11.563
I just hope Sarah didn't catch
any feelings after last night.

27:11.629 --> 27:15.467
He doesn't give a fuck about Sarah.
He knows it will wind Marty up.

27:15.533 --> 27:19.537
Marty... It's just gonna be this
back and forwards the whole time.

27:19.604 --> 27:22.440
Let's just forget about last night
and hit the slopes

27:22.507 --> 27:26.878
before we have to check out
the Geordie Tours bonding experience.

27:32.517 --> 27:34.386
Time to go.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.590
Woo!
Whoa, man!

27:46.264 --> 27:48.199
This is what it's all about.

27:48.266 --> 27:53.838
Perfect blue skies, perfect snow
and watching Aaron fall on his arse.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.246
(laughs)

28:01.312 --> 28:04.015
Everyone is trying to get
a bit of skiing in, not me.

28:04.082 --> 28:06.985
I'm shit. I'll catch up
with Sarah about last night.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.021
You were kinda pissed last night.
I can't remember.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.322
I don't remember a lot.

28:11.389 --> 28:13.925
So, are you gonna end up
shagging Scott?

28:14.993 --> 28:19.064
I don't know. He's being very vocal
about the fact that he does like us.

28:19.130 --> 28:23.735
If you want my advice, I'd say
don't get with anyone in the house.

28:23.802 --> 28:27.305
Sarah is me ex and I don't want to
see anyone treating her like shit.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.808
Especially not Scott. The bellend!

28:29.874 --> 28:32.243
I don't know,
I just don't think it's healthy

28:32.310 --> 28:34.846
to get with someone in the house.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.849
It's just not... Arguments.
You're looking out for us?

28:37.916 --> 28:40.819
I'm looking out for us.
Got my best interests at heart?

28:40.885 --> 28:42.921
For the both of us,
you shouldn't bang.

28:42.987 --> 28:45.523
Sorry, Marty, I'm not your property

28:45.590 --> 28:47.859
and if I wanna
get with Scott, I will.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.695
Give us a kiss. (laughs)

28:50.762 --> 28:52.564
I'm gonna tell Scott!

28:57.836 --> 29:02.140
I fucking love snowboarding,
but it's time to go back to work.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.542
(cheering)

29:04.609 --> 29:07.078
Anna wants us to try out
this team bonding shit

29:07.145 --> 29:08.880
for her Geordie Tours business.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.282
I think she's properly lost the plot

29:11.349 --> 29:14.018
cos all she wants us to do is
hoy down the mountain

29:14.085 --> 29:15.887
on a couple of plastic spoons.

29:15.954 --> 29:19.657
What ya doing? Cheers, Anna.
This looks fucking shit.

29:19.724 --> 29:22.393
(screaming)

29:25.096 --> 29:28.933
(Gaz) Sledging, all tied together
going down a red run.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.469
Anna, are you trying
to fucking kill us?

29:31.536 --> 29:34.239
(screaming)

29:37.475 --> 29:39.611
How can this be team bonding

29:39.677 --> 29:42.080
when all we're doing
is fucking screaming?

29:42.147 --> 29:43.948
(screaming)

29:53.591 --> 29:58.129
This sledging is proper lethal.
I'm getting hoyed all over the shop.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.598
(screaming)

30:05.003 --> 30:06.137
(cheering)

30:06.204 --> 30:08.706
The only thing we bonded over
during sledging

30:08.773 --> 30:11.209
was the fact that none of us
wanted to die.

30:11.276 --> 30:14.579
Thank fuck that's over. Oh, God!

30:14.646 --> 30:16.381
Team bonding was fucking class.

30:16.447 --> 30:21.286
I love sledging, but now it's time
to get back, get ready and go out.

30:29.194 --> 30:32.997
We get back to the chalet and us
originals need to have a chat.

30:33.064 --> 30:37.302
Sorry to be rude, can you give us
two seconds while we have a word?

30:37.368 --> 30:39.737
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Go on, fuck off.

30:39.804 --> 30:41.539
The newbies are still on trial.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.409
So, we need to know
what Scott thinks of them so far.

30:44.475 --> 30:47.011
Who's your favourite?
Say your order.

30:47.078 --> 30:48.980
Who would you like to live with?

30:49.047 --> 30:53.418
Order, I'd say Sam and Abbie,
Sarah and Zahida.

30:53.484 --> 30:55.053
Curveball!

30:55.119 --> 30:57.322
I thought you fancied Sarah!

30:57.388 --> 30:59.224
I don't fancy her.
Ooh!

30:59.290 --> 31:03.494
You're a fucking weird one, ye like.
You've been cracking on with Sarah

31:03.561 --> 31:06.164
and now you say
you don't want her to live with wor.

31:06.231 --> 31:09.267
Hold on a minute,
I smell something fishy.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.736
I've got with her,
it doesn't mean I fancy her.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.371
I fancy anything with a fanny.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.941
Scott has just picked
Abbie over Sarah.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.811
That's gonna fuck Sarah off
if she finds out.

31:19.877 --> 31:22.647
This is gonna be interesting.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.819
We want to party!

31:27.885 --> 31:30.421
I cannot see this
ending well for Sam.

31:30.488 --> 31:32.023
(gags)
Really?!

31:33.191 --> 31:35.159
Abbie is looking naughty tonight.

31:35.226 --> 31:38.363
Sarah, sorry,
but you've been fucked off.

31:38.429 --> 31:39.797
Feel like a fucking knob.

31:39.864 --> 31:41.666
What the fuck is she playing at?

31:41.733 --> 31:42.967
Ah!

31:43.034 --> 31:46.904
There's only one thing on my mind
and that's Scotty's package.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.210
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:54.946 --> 31:55.146
.

31:57.682 --> 31:57.882
.

32:08.926 --> 32:11.629
# I sleep in a car and I ski all day

32:11.696 --> 32:13.998
# Both my parents
Don't know that I'm gay

32:14.065 --> 32:16.334
# I'm gay every day of my life #

32:16.401 --> 32:18.903
Sound like fucking Beyonce.
(laughs)

32:22.907 --> 32:25.543
What do you reckon
you're gonna do about Scott?

32:25.610 --> 32:28.613
Just be fit and dance,
or are you gonna try nest with him?

32:28.680 --> 32:31.582
I never try and nest anyone, like.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.252
Sarah and Zahida
are talking about Scott

32:34.319 --> 32:39.023
and I'm sat there thinking,
shit, awkward, I like him too.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.759
I mean, he is single,
so it's fair game.

32:41.826 --> 32:45.163
I've got a feeling things are
going to get fucked up with Scott.

32:45.229 --> 32:47.699
I've got me guard up.
Why do you have that?

32:47.765 --> 32:49.467
I don't know. I can just tell.

32:49.534 --> 32:53.805
I know for a flying fact
that Abbie has got her eye on Scott.

32:53.871 --> 32:56.841
Right now she's being
worryingly quiet.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.745
Anyone I ever fucking date
or take an interest in

33:00.812 --> 33:03.681
fucks us over, so he'll be next.

33:07.085 --> 33:10.121
Oh, shit. We're going out tonight.
I need a haircut,

33:10.188 --> 33:12.824
cos this snow
is causing uproar with my quiff.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.059
I had a chance
to speak to Sarah, right?

33:15.126 --> 33:18.096
Apparently she seems
to think that you like her.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.330
What?

33:19.397 --> 33:23.267
Scott, Sarah said to me today
that you said you liked her.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.269
If you don't, you need to tell her,

33:25.336 --> 33:27.538
otherwise you're gonna
string her along.

33:27.605 --> 33:30.007
I may have told her
when she walked in.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.777
I haven't said I liked her,
I just said...

33:32.844 --> 33:34.579
Well, she said that you have.

33:34.645 --> 33:38.249
I don't why but I seem to think
that you probably did.

33:38.316 --> 33:39.817
(laughs)

33:39.884 --> 33:43.187
Most girls think that fancy them
cos I flirt with them a lot,

33:43.254 --> 33:45.490
but only one part of me
fancies every girl

33:45.556 --> 33:48.860
and that's my fucking chode.
Don't ya, mate?

33:48.926 --> 33:52.563
I've been away and I'm not gonna
come back to have drama with birds.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.798
Did I hear that right?

33:53.865 --> 33:57.068
Scott saying he's gonna stay
out of trouble with the girls?

33:57.135 --> 33:59.203
Mate, if I had
a crystal ball right now,

33:59.270 --> 34:02.373
I'd predict in the next 48 hours
you're gonna be in the shit.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.382
Everyone sorted?
(all) Yeah!

34:11.449 --> 34:14.385
Everyone wanna get pissed?
Yeah!

34:14.452 --> 34:16.053
I can't fucking hear ya!
Yeah!

34:16.120 --> 34:17.855
Let's fucking go, then.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.424
Come on, bitches.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.826
(cheering)

34:21.893 --> 34:23.928
Cash me outside, how 'bout dah!

34:23.995 --> 34:26.597
Watch your step, mate.
Slippy as fuck.

34:26.664 --> 34:29.867
We're walking and we find
a nice little bar.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.203
Fuck it, this will do.
Let's get smashed!

34:32.270 --> 34:34.205
Ah, this is ill.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.109
We get into the bar
and it's not exactly rocking.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.844
Not the typical normal night out,
but it'll do.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.947
It's time to bring
the Toon to Tignes!

34:43.014 --> 34:44.815
Warm your fannies up.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.484
Anyone up for shots?

34:46.551 --> 34:48.686
(cheering)

34:48.753 --> 34:50.755
We want to party!

34:57.027 --> 34:58.863
If Anna still hasn't decided

34:58.930 --> 35:01.532
which one of us newbies
she wants working for her,

35:01.599 --> 35:04.469
tonight is my chance
to show the guys it should be me.

35:11.242 --> 35:13.678
I cannot see this
ending well for Sam.

35:13.744 --> 35:17.248
It's only early doors
and he's already in a bad way.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.918
Howay! Get it fuckin down ya, son!

35:20.985 --> 35:22.987
I'm the one necking all the shots.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.289
I'm blind drunk, but I'm loving it.

35:25.356 --> 35:29.927
(all) Get it down ya, get it down ya!

35:29.994 --> 35:32.864
(laughter, cheering)

35:43.574 --> 35:46.344
I know Scott
and right now he is grafting Abbie.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.779
He's made a beeline
and he's going for it.

35:48.846 --> 35:52.116
Sarah, sorry,
but you've been fucked off.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.293
I've liked Scott
from the minute that I seen him.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.963
He's single and he's flirting,
so why wouldn't I crack on?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.004
Abbie is looking
fucking naughty tonight,

36:13.070 --> 36:16.240
but she'd look better
with her legs around me forehead.

36:18.709 --> 36:19.744
I'm not blind!

36:19.810 --> 36:23.915
I can see him grabbing her
arse every four fucking seconds.

36:25.082 --> 36:27.251
Stop it!
I knew it.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.788
Abbie is all over Scott.
She knows I like him.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.558
What the fuck is she playing at?
It's sly as fuck.

36:33.624 --> 36:36.460
If she came over to me and said,
"I really like Scott."

36:36.527 --> 36:39.363
"I think we've got a connection."
I'd just be like...

36:39.430 --> 36:41.933
That's not a connection,
it's a fanny flutter.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.669
It must be hard for Sarah
to watch Abbie flirt

36:44.735 --> 36:46.904
with the lad
she had in her bed last night.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.840
I thought us newbies
were meant to stick together.

36:57.682 --> 37:00.017
Sam, you might be
good at cutting hair,

37:00.084 --> 37:01.919
but you are shit at drinking!

37:07.692 --> 37:09.694
No, I feel like a fuckin' knob!

37:11.529 --> 37:13.965
Sarah's crying
cos I've been grafting Abbie.

37:14.031 --> 37:16.500
I do feel bad,
but all we did was cuddle.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.303
And let's face it,
I'm a fucking rascal!

37:19.370 --> 37:22.707
Are you OK? You all right?
What's the matter?

37:22.773 --> 37:25.610
I'll tell you what's the matter,
I feel like a mug

37:25.676 --> 37:29.480
for going with Scott and now
I feel betrayed by my friend.

37:29.547 --> 37:32.450
What did I say to you?
Don't get involved with people!

37:32.516 --> 37:35.519
I hate to say I told you so,
but I told her so!

37:35.586 --> 37:38.422
He don't care about upsetting us
and it makes us think

37:38.489 --> 37:41.258
who cares about us in this house?
I care about you.

37:41.325 --> 37:43.594
Come here. Give us a cuddle.

37:49.600 --> 37:53.237
I'm talking to Gaz and I see Sarah
crying in one corner

37:53.304 --> 37:55.139
and Abbie with Scott in the other.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.441
These newbies
are bringing all the drama.

37:57.508 --> 38:01.946
If Abbie hasn't got loyalties
with Sarah, who she's friends with,

38:02.013 --> 38:04.482
what happens if Abbie stays?
It's hard, innit.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.884
At the same time,
you know what Scott's like.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.086
She's right,
you've got to have loyalty

38:09.153 --> 38:10.888
to be part of the Geordie Family.

38:10.955 --> 38:15.026
Scott's keeping his options open
and causing mayhem at the same time.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.228
(cheering)

38:22.767 --> 38:25.736
Everyone, let's go. Nathan, Aaron!

38:25.803 --> 38:27.304
Everyone is mortal.

38:27.371 --> 38:30.875
We need to get back to the house
and carry on the par-tay!

38:34.679 --> 38:38.215
Listen to this, listen to this...
Scott and Abbie... Scabbie!

38:38.282 --> 38:40.618
(laughter)

38:40.685 --> 38:44.321
Abbie and Scott don't have
the best couple name now, do they?

38:44.388 --> 38:48.292
Scabbie. I mean,
it speaks volumes for itself.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.028
(laughter)

38:51.095 --> 38:52.997
Tonight has been so much fun

38:53.064 --> 38:55.399
and me and Marty
are getting on so good.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.468
I'm just so happy.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.503
Sarah!

38:59.570 --> 39:03.374
I'm having the worst night ever.
I just want to go home.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.509
Oh, ya!

39:05.576 --> 39:09.146
On the way back, I thought it'd be
a good idea to make snow angels.

39:10.481 --> 39:13.851
(laughter)

39:13.918 --> 39:16.087
Turns out it wasn't a good idea.

39:16.153 --> 39:19.857
Go on, Chloe! Go on!

39:19.924 --> 39:24.095
(cheering, laughter)

39:27.031 --> 39:29.467
Fuck me, snow is cold, like!

39:29.533 --> 39:32.236
(laughter)

39:33.237 --> 39:36.340
Fair play to Sam tonight.
He has been fucking hilarious,

39:36.407 --> 39:38.909
but go on, mate,
jump in that snow one more time.

39:38.976 --> 39:44.548
One more time, one more time!
(laughter)

39:47.351 --> 39:49.086
That's made my night.

39:51.789 --> 39:55.025
I don't think I've ever been
this cold in my entire life!

39:57.094 --> 40:00.064
I'm back at the chalet
and I'm going straight to bed.

40:00.131 --> 40:04.301
I've had enough of the Scabbie show.
Tonight has been wank.

40:04.368 --> 40:07.404
Scotty and Abbie, Scabbie!

40:07.471 --> 40:10.341
Sitting in a tree, Scabbie!

40:10.407 --> 40:13.677
This is how you do it!
Shut up, you little...

40:13.744 --> 40:16.680
Scotty, Scotty... (laughs)

40:16.747 --> 40:18.582
Everyone's got something to say.

40:18.649 --> 40:21.018
The funny thing is
you're going to bed alone

40:21.085 --> 40:24.288
and I'm going to bed with her,
so fucking na-night, ya dick.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.929
Don't get upset.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.365
I go to the newbies' room
to see if Sarah's OK.

40:34.431 --> 40:37.902
She's been really upset tonight
and I feel so sorry for her.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.538
I know how it feels to be
messed around by boys.

40:40.604 --> 40:44.341
I've been mugged off by Scott,
I've been mugged off by Marty.

40:44.408 --> 40:46.944
I wouldn't honestly
get upset about it.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.246
I appreciate her
coming in to comfort us,

40:49.313 --> 40:51.782
because we've got
the same taste in lads.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.919
Whatever I'm going through,
she's been through before.

40:54.985 --> 40:59.957
They're boys. They're boys.
Why would you let that get you down?

41:00.024 --> 41:04.261
Trust me, I have been there before
and Scotty is not worth it.

41:04.328 --> 41:07.565
He is only after a fucking bang.

41:07.631 --> 41:11.035
Just count yourself lucky
you're not getting hurt like she is.

41:20.144 --> 41:24.048
There's only one thing on my mind
and that's Scotty's package.

41:24.114 --> 41:27.751
I'm not gonna go there yet.
I just want a sneak peek.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.691
Howay, Abbie. Fucking liberty!

41:41.999 --> 41:43.734
Sam...
What?

41:43.801 --> 41:45.135
You all right?

41:48.505 --> 41:50.841
(retches)
Oh, Sam!

41:50.908 --> 41:52.409
Really?

41:52.476 --> 41:55.412
Sam! Get out, Sam, get out!

41:55.479 --> 41:58.415
He's been sick
at the bottom of my bed.

41:59.483 --> 42:02.586
Prick. Me fucking trainer, man!

42:04.488 --> 42:07.591
In me trainer, man! Sam!

42:11.695 --> 42:13.731
Tonight has been very eventful.

42:13.797 --> 42:18.002
And for once, it's nice to watch
the drama and not be part of it.

42:18.068 --> 42:21.672
I feel like me and Marty
have actually turned a page.

42:23.107 --> 42:26.610
Oh, shit!
I thought you were a ghost.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.345
Fuck me.

42:28.412 --> 42:32.583
Woo! No, man, Marty, it's just me,
your best pal, Chloe.

42:32.650 --> 42:33.717
Oi-oi!

42:36.353 --> 42:38.422
You're my best friend.

42:38.489 --> 42:42.626
I've never felt this close to Marty.
If this is what friends feel like,

42:42.693 --> 42:45.029
I wanna stay like this
for the rest of my life.

42:46.964 --> 42:49.400
It's good to know that me
and Chloe are spot on.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.569
If there's anyone I ever need
in this house, it's her.

42:59.677 --> 43:00.811
Hiya!

43:00.878 --> 43:02.980
It's always good
to see Marnie's face.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.683
(screaming, gasping, laughter)

43:05.749 --> 43:07.418
(screaming)

43:07.484 --> 43:10.120
I am really into Scott.

43:14.291 --> 43:15.960
Fuck this, they're going akka!

43:18.629 --> 43:21.131
It is snowman sabotage.

43:21.198 --> 43:23.334
(cheering)

43:23.400 --> 43:26.603
I am in full swing tonight.
I can't wait!

43:26.670 --> 43:29.006
Fuck me, has she just swilled Aaron?

43:30.307 --> 43:32.142
Yeah, Nathan!

43:32.209 --> 43:33.610
(laughter)

43:33.677 --> 43:35.012
Things are heating up.

44:03.440 --> 44:03.640
.
