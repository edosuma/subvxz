WEBVTT

01:13.377 --> 01:15.771
This means war.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.759
Oh, my baby.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.196
Fucking college.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.329
Okay,
so, I checked

02:35.329 --> 02:37.287
the weather in Portland
and it's 85 degrees,

02:37.287 --> 02:38.462
so you will need
your sunscreen.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.898
Yeah, I know, Mom.
It's in my backpack.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.683
You got all
your other toiletries?

02:41.683 --> 02:44.164
Yes, in my bag
that you packed.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.513
- While I watched, remember?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.689
You were crying
the whole time.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.169
Yeah, what a mess.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.909
It's not like he's going
off to war. It's just Oregon.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.259
I know, I know,

02:52.259 --> 02:53.999
but it's such
an amazing time in your life,

02:53.999 --> 02:55.871
you can literally become
anyone you wanna be.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.525
- Mom?
- You could
change the world.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.743
- Mom?
- You could
colonize Mars.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.049
- I mean...
- Mom,

03:00.049 --> 03:01.093
you're spiraling.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.274
- Sorry, sorry, boys.
We'll just be one minute.
No problem.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.406
And remember...

03:09.406 --> 03:10.842
- Lakers for life.
- Lakers for
life, I know.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.235
Come back a Blazers fan,
I'm not gonna let you

03:12.235 --> 03:13.323
- back in the house.
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.498
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.152
Stop eating
the trail mix.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.067
It's for Nicky.
It's a long trip.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.243
Um, I guess
this is it.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.592
I'm sorry,
I'm a little emotional.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.380
Mom, Dad.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.251
- Okay.
- I love you. I love you.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.166
- I love you. I love you.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.516
Okay, see you later.
Call me when
you get there.

03:32.516 --> 03:35.171
Yo, let's... fuckin' go.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.216
Freedom!

03:37.739 --> 03:38.740
Let's do this.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.612
There goes our baby.

03:41.612 --> 03:42.700
- Ah!

03:42.700 --> 03:43.919
I love you!

03:45.181 --> 03:47.923
Every woman
dreams of full brows

03:47.923 --> 03:50.491
and long luscious eyelashes.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.276
And thanks to Profizal's
hair-generating technology,

03:53.276 --> 03:55.191
I believe we have
a real opportunity

03:55.191 --> 03:57.106
to market this
to chemo patients.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.632
It's too sad.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.634
I mean,
anybody here wanna be sad?

04:03.634 --> 04:05.288
No.
Nobody
wants to be sad.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.029
Where's the ad that says

04:07.029 --> 04:10.641
Profizal puts hair
on men's heads?

04:10.641 --> 04:12.164
That's who we should
be marketing to.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.906
Insecure men

04:14.906 --> 04:16.473
with lots of cash.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.823
No, actually, Dad,
ICO labs said Profizal

04:18.823 --> 04:20.434
- doesn't work on scalps.
- It doesn't?

04:20.434 --> 04:21.957
- No.
Oh, shit.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.002
We gotta get you on
another project, dammit.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.962
Oh, what about Restylane?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.312
The anti-ageing filler?

04:29.312 --> 04:32.054
Yes, the new
Galderma product

04:32.054 --> 04:33.229
for older women.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.752
Because, you know,
you're a...

04:34.752 --> 04:37.712
...you're... you're
an expert, really.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.367
I mean, you're of
a certain age bracket.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.107
- I'm 40.
- Whoa! I did not
ask her age.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.195
Everybody saw
that, right?

04:43.195 --> 04:44.284
Would never do that.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.676
Look, I really think

04:45.676 --> 04:47.199
this would be
a perfect fit for you.

04:47.852 --> 04:48.853
Okay.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.160
Randy, what do you got?

04:56.165 --> 04:57.514
Erectile dysfunction, Hank,

04:58.907 --> 05:00.300
is a thing of the past

05:00.778 --> 05:01.823
with Thoracinil.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.306
Hey. So, Thoracinil
is banned in the EU,

05:06.306 --> 05:07.916
so we can't
use Mykonos

05:07.916 --> 05:10.135
but he's on a jet-ski.
I love those.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.572
- I love jet-skis.

05:13.922 --> 05:17.317
- Hello?
<i>Is this Kristin Balbano?</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:18.666
Uh, well,
it's Kristin Dorner

05:18.666 --> 05:20.058
Balbano
is my maiden name.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.192
<i>You never give up
the name Balbano.</i>

05:23.192 --> 05:24.454
Sorry? Who is this?

05:24.454 --> 05:25.499
I am Bianca

05:27.065 --> 05:28.806
and I have
terrible news.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.808
<i>Giuseppe Balbano
is dead.</i>

05:30.808 --> 05:33.637
- Oh, my father's father.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.118
God, I didn't even
know he was alive.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.293
Can you hold
on a sec?

05:37.293 --> 05:38.425
Paul!

05:40.035 --> 05:41.036
My husband's
in a band.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.560
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.432
Your grandfather
is dead.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.390
You need to
settle his affairs.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.827
His affairs? But, I mean,

05:49.827 --> 05:51.263
I don't even know him.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.004
<i>You're named specifically
in his will.</i>

05:54.136 --> 05:55.833
<i>We'll fly you to Italy.</i>

05:55.833 --> 05:57.400
<i>You'll leave
tomorrow night.</i>

05:57.400 --> 05:59.837
Wait. What, did you say Italy?

05:59.837 --> 06:02.318
Like, as in Italy Italy?

06:02.318 --> 06:03.537
<i>Yes, Italy.</i>

06:03.537 --> 06:04.886
Oh, that sounds...

06:06.453 --> 06:08.803
No, I... No, I can't
just get on a plane

06:08.803 --> 06:10.631
and head on over
to my dream place.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.720
Everything is crazy
at work right now

06:12.720 --> 06:14.722
and my husband
needs me, you know?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.550
- And I just can't see
that I can get away...

06:16.550 --> 06:18.203
Quiet, listen
to my lyric here.

06:18.203 --> 06:22.164
<i>♪ I'm no longer
Ear-ear-earth...♪</i>

06:22.164 --> 06:23.339
I gotta go.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.819
<i>♪ ...Bound</i>

06:27.996 --> 06:30.172
What time is it?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.394
Kristin...

06:35.917 --> 06:38.006
- Before you start...
- Hey

06:38.006 --> 06:40.617
- Hey.
- Listen, I just want
you to know I'm a feminist.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.445
Uh...

06:42.445 --> 06:43.664
We met before.

06:43.664 --> 06:44.752
- Really?
Yeah.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.101
At Domenick's school,

06:46.101 --> 06:47.450
I'm the guidance counsellor.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.193
- Oh, my God.
I...
It's just that,

06:51.193 --> 06:52.499
I wouldn't have done
this if you had

06:52.499 --> 06:53.935
more faith in
your husband.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.415
He's a great songwriter.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.068
I know.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.853
Tracy, it's time
for you to go.

07:01.899 --> 07:02.900
What?

07:07.731 --> 07:09.516
- Listen.
- Yes, listening.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.518
- I support your
right to be angry.
Thank you so much.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.998
- That's really kind.
- Yeah, maybe call me,

07:13.998 --> 07:15.435
we can talk this through.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.784
- Really? You would do that?
- What d'you say?

07:16.784 --> 07:17.872
Yeah.
Sure, I mean...

07:17.872 --> 07:19.003
Bye.
- Bye.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.008
Kris, I am so sorry.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.359
This is really hard
for me to admit but,

07:28.578 --> 07:30.406
I have this illness.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.844
All I wanna do
is have sex.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.065
I mean,
I wanna have sex, too.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.719
We haven't had
sex in, like,

07:38.719 --> 07:40.285
- three years.
- Yeah, I know,

07:40.285 --> 07:41.983
but I mean,
with a new person.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.593
Oh!

07:43.593 --> 07:46.030
Yeah, it's not personal, it's...

07:46.030 --> 07:47.249
- Hey,

07:47.902 --> 07:48.903
I left my phone.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.687
My phone.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.779
- This one?
- Yeah, thank you.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.131
It's just hard, you know,
with Domenick leaving,

08:00.131 --> 08:01.306
it's just a big adjustment.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.395
Don't defend
that douche stain.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.615
He's a grown-ass man
working at a Starbucks.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.269
Stranger grabs your purse.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.706
Crotch. Eye.
Crotch. Eye.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.534
Stranger grabs
your boob.

08:11.534 --> 08:15.233
Crotch. Eye.
Crotch. Eye.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.193
- What? Oh, my God!
- Is that him?

08:18.193 --> 08:20.151
- Is that him? Give me
the phone.
- No, it's Italy calling again.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.153
They want me to fly to Rome

08:22.153 --> 08:24.242
tomorrow night
to settle his affairs.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.071
I mean, that's crazy,
right? I can't go.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.464
Kristin,

08:28.464 --> 08:30.684
what do you
masturbate to?

08:30.684 --> 08:33.164
Italian cooking shows.
I mean, more specifically,

08:33.164 --> 08:34.731
<i>Stanley Tucci:
Searching for Italy.</i>

08:34.731 --> 08:36.037
There was this one episode

08:36.037 --> 08:37.691
where he went to this
burrata factory,

08:37.691 --> 08:38.996
and it was all creamy

08:38.996 --> 08:40.955
and he got his hands
in all the milky stuff.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.044
- It was so...
- Stop. You've masturbated

08:43.044 --> 08:44.741
this fantasy into existence.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.221
You have to go.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.615
Stranger puts
a gun in your face.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.575
Jenny, my boss just
assigned me a new campaign.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.098
Well, make it
a business trip.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.579
ICO has suppliers
all over the globe.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.103
How do you think
I got to go to Brazil,
Iceland and Ireland

08:59.103 --> 09:00.583
- last year, huh?
- I don't know.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.803
To settle their lawsuits.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.413
Well, shouldn't I stay here

09:04.413 --> 09:05.762
and work on my marriage?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.329
You should work on
getting your pussy pounded.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.331
Oh, my God.
- Stranger says
you're prettier

09:09.331 --> 09:11.028
when you smile.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.901
Crotch. Eye.
Crotch. Eye.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.120
Stop thinking about
everybody else.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.426
Start thinking about you.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.299
Fine, then think
about your grandfather's

09:21.299 --> 09:22.387
last dying wish.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.650
Oh, my God
maybe I should go.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.477
- Did you see
what I did there?
- No.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.262
I just got you to go
to Italy by putting

09:27.262 --> 09:28.655
- someone else's feelings
ahead of your own.
- All right, all right,

09:28.655 --> 09:30.526
I deserve this.
I deserve this.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.528
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna have my own

Eat, Pray, Fuck.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.584
Say it.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.588
What, Eat, Pray... Fuck?

09:49.371 --> 09:50.938
Eat, Pray, Fuck.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.941
Jesus.

Hey, Nicky. It's Mom.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.128
I just wanna let you know

10:51.128 --> 10:52.869
I landed safe, in Italy.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.916
I even bought
myself a journal at the airport.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.308
I've always wanted a journal.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.616
Um, anyway... Shit.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.487
Sorry, not you.
I love you. Anyway...

11:02.487 --> 11:03.619
Oh... Whoa!

11:17.938 --> 11:19.461
I said
you can stand up,

11:19.461 --> 11:21.158
- if you like.
- Oh, my God. Right.
Yes, thank you.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.769
Oh, my God,
you smell so good.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.771
Um, I'm, um...

11:25.685 --> 11:27.730
Oh, my God, what is

11:27.730 --> 11:29.863
my name?
Sorry. Kristin. Hi.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.256
- Kristin, I'm Lorenzo.
- Yes. Hello, Lorenzo.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.432
- Lorenzo!
<i>Scusa!</i>

11:34.432 --> 11:35.564
Sorry. Uh...
- It's okay.

- This is my
Aunt Esmeralda.
- Oh.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.002
She just got back
from holiday in Greece.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.090
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.831
And she wants
to get home.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.529
Hi. <i>Ciao.</i> I'm Kristin.
I'm just visiting.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.531
Yeah. I mean,

but I haven't
been back

11:48.142 --> 11:50.666
since I was a... a baby.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.018
What did she say?

11:55.018 --> 11:57.368
She wants me to ask
for your number.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.979
But don't worry,
I don't want to assume.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.676
- Well...
So...

12:01.633 --> 12:03.026
<i>Ciao.</i>

12:03.026 --> 12:04.767
Uh, no, no.
Wait. I mean,

12:04.767 --> 12:07.465
if Aunt Esmeralda
wants my number,
who am I to say "no?"

12:08.989 --> 12:11.252
Oh, sorry. I am not
usually so <i>veloce</i>

12:11.252 --> 12:12.557
with asking for
phone numbers.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.603
- What is <i>veloce?</i>
- Oh, yeah. Quick.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.691
If... if you knew that,

12:15.691 --> 12:16.910
it would have been funnier.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.695
No, it's very funny, I get it.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.958
I got it, <i>Veloce.
Veloce</i> is good. I...

12:21.958 --> 12:24.613
I like your <i>veloce-ness.</i>

12:27.616 --> 12:28.748
My God!

12:28.748 --> 12:30.793
- What was that?
I am so sorry.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.839
It's okay.
So, are you here on

12:32.839 --> 12:34.449
business or pleasure?

12:34.449 --> 12:35.755
Um, well...

12:37.191 --> 12:40.890
pleasure. You know,
grandfather just died and...

12:40.890 --> 12:42.326
Oh, no, I... I didn't know
him, that's not...

12:42.326 --> 12:44.111
that part's sad, but, um...

12:44.111 --> 12:45.155
So maybe...

12:46.287 --> 12:47.549
half pleasure.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.770
I have to run.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.728
Yes, sure. Um...

12:52.728 --> 12:54.469
Well, I'll... I'll call you.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.123
What...

12:56.863 --> 12:58.342
just happened?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.954
- Oh, my God.
- Kristin Balbano.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.216
Yes.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.783
Bianca sent us
to take you to the funeral.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.262
- Oh, hi. I...
- I'm Aldo.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.090
Okay. Nice to meet you,
Aldo. Yes.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.440
- I'm Dante.
- Hello, Dante.
Nice to meet you.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.573
- Your driver.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.793
I... It's very... So kind.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.584
Hey, you guys. I am gonna
change now, okay?

13:22.584 --> 13:24.891
So don't turn around or...

13:24.891 --> 13:26.414
The Colosseum.
- Can you at least,

13:26.414 --> 13:28.068
please, just, like, go slow?

13:28.068 --> 13:30.766
The Vatican.
The <i>Vaticano?</i>

13:30.766 --> 13:32.724
Did I miss it?
I missed it, right?

13:32.724 --> 13:35.597
- Oh, shit. Ugh, God.
Where is my lipstick?
Fontana Acqua Paola.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.425
I dropped
my lipstick.
<i>Il Fontanone.</i>

13:37.425 --> 13:38.861
Oh, what? Where is it?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.255
- Can we go back?
- We have to go
to the funeral.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.150
Oh, thank you.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.413
Whew, thank you so much.

14:09.936 --> 14:10.980
Oh, my God.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.243
There he is.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.332
Hi.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.334
We have the same eyes.
We have the same eyes.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.554
That's...

14:19.554 --> 14:21.643
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

14:37.920 --> 14:39.879
Hi. <i>Ciao.</i> Sorry. Um...

14:39.879 --> 14:41.228
Are you Bianca?

14:43.273 --> 14:44.274
Sit.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.933
This is Fabrizio,

14:50.933 --> 14:53.240
your grandfather's
great nephew.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.546
Oh, hi, hi. Nice to meet you.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.026
So, that must make us, like,

14:57.026 --> 14:58.723
second cousins, right?

14:58.723 --> 14:59.942
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.512
Is he mad at me?

15:18.569 --> 15:19.919
Amen.

15:29.624 --> 15:30.886
Uh...

15:30.886 --> 15:32.322
what did my grandfather do?

15:33.367 --> 15:35.108
He was a winemaker.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.718
He made wine?

15:36.718 --> 15:37.937
I wanna make wine.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.416
Oh, my God,
it must be in the genes.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.940
I mean, you can't
argue genes, right?

16:14.756 --> 16:15.975
Hey, hey,
hey. Are you okay?

16:22.111 --> 16:23.373
<i>Veloce</i> means quick.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.245
Quick, quick, quick!
He needs help!

16:51.575 --> 16:52.576
Hmm.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.626
.

17:43.236 --> 17:46.065
Say hello
to my little friend, Nico.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.952
What the fuck is going on?

18:48.039 --> 18:49.084
So...

18:49.084 --> 18:51.478
Aldo and Dante are my drivers,

18:51.478 --> 18:54.133
but who are you, really?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.483
<i>- Soldati.</i>
- For the Army or...

19:09.539 --> 19:10.888
<i>Scusi.</i> Hi, hi.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.847
Uh, I'm still in the dark here.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.156
No, no, it's a figure
of speech.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.593
Can someone please just
tell me what's going on?

19:19.593 --> 19:22.378
Your grandfather,
Don Giuseppe Balbano,

19:23.336 --> 19:25.381
may he rest in peace,

19:26.469 --> 19:27.775
was murdered

19:27.775 --> 19:31.126
- by the Romanos.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.215
We invited them
for a meeting,

19:33.215 --> 19:36.000
but things went wrong.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.786
Our Don
and their Don got killed.

19:42.355 --> 19:45.009
They disrespected
the funeral!

19:45.009 --> 19:46.968
They shot at
the coffin!

20:11.558 --> 20:12.559
Don Carlo.

21:14.403 --> 21:17.014
To calm you down.
- Okay, thank you,
thank you.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.059
<i>Grazie.</i>

21:21.323 --> 21:23.107
The wine's bad. The wine's
gone bad. That's...

21:23.107 --> 21:25.806
The wine is bad.
It's a front.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.590
Oh, God. Is that why
he got murdered?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.897
No, that's crazy.
I mean, is it?

21:29.897 --> 21:31.638
Your grandfather

21:32.508 --> 21:34.205
was not just a winemaker.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.555
No?

21:41.952 --> 21:43.389
<i>Ciao, Kristin Balbano.</i>

21:44.738 --> 21:47.654
<i>I'm your grandfather,
Giuseppe Balbano.</i>

21:48.524 --> 21:49.917
<i>If you are watching this...</i>

21:51.092 --> 21:52.833
<i>I'm dead.</i>

21:52.833 --> 21:55.966
<i>I'm sorry I never
got to see you grow up,</i>

21:55.966 --> 21:58.099
<i>but I am even more sorry</i>

21:58.099 --> 21:59.318
<i>that you grew up</i>

22:00.144 --> 22:01.624
<i>without a father.</i>

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
My father died in
a construction accident.

22:03.931 --> 22:07.151
<i>Your father did not die</i>

22:07.151 --> 22:09.023
<i>in a construction accident.</i>

22:09.023 --> 22:11.504
<i>Your father was killed</i>

22:11.504 --> 22:13.375
<i>by a member of the...</i>

22:14.463 --> 22:15.551
<i>Romano family.</i>

22:18.728 --> 22:20.295
<i>After this incident,</i>

22:20.295 --> 22:22.428
<i>your mother took you
back to America</i>

22:22.428 --> 22:25.996
<i>in search of a safer place.</i>

22:30.087 --> 22:31.088
<i>Hey.</i>

22:34.440 --> 22:37.399
<i>I told her
that the safest place</i>

22:37.399 --> 22:38.618
<i>would be with us,</i>

22:38.618 --> 22:40.228
<i>but I respected</i>

22:40.228 --> 22:41.316
<i>her wishes.</i>

22:41.316 --> 22:43.753
<i>You do not cross a mother.</i>

22:51.457 --> 22:52.545
- It's you.
- Oh.

22:55.852 --> 22:58.246
<i>I remember when
you were born,</i>

22:58.246 --> 22:59.900
<i>picciridda mia.</i>

22:59.900 --> 23:02.163
<i>I held you in my arms...</i>

23:05.079 --> 23:07.342
<i>and I thought, "One day</i>

23:07.342 --> 23:10.867
<i>"she will be a brave,
confident woman</i>

23:10.867 --> 23:12.739
<i>"who will make me proud."</i>

23:13.783 --> 23:15.437
<i>Saying goodbye to you,</i>

23:15.437 --> 23:17.352
<i>my only grandchild,</i>

23:17.352 --> 23:18.788
<i>was the hardest thing</i>

23:19.615 --> 23:20.616
<i>I ever had to do.</i>

23:25.491 --> 23:26.448
<i>And so,</i>

23:27.144 --> 23:29.059
<i>my dying wish</i>

23:29.059 --> 23:30.757
<i>is that you,</i>

23:30.757 --> 23:32.367
<i>my direct bloodline,</i>

23:33.107 --> 23:34.674
<i>take over</i>

23:34.674 --> 23:36.458
<i>and be the new boss</i>

23:38.025 --> 23:39.330
<i>of the Balbano family.</i>

23:40.723 --> 23:42.725
<i>My trusted general, Bianca...</i>

23:44.074 --> 23:46.294
<i>...will be by your side
to help you.</i>

23:48.818 --> 23:50.690
<i>Kristin,</i>

23:50.690 --> 23:53.301
<i>I know you will
respect my wishes</i>

23:55.085 --> 23:58.741
<i>as I respected your mother's.</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:06.009
Oh, this isn't...

24:09.709 --> 24:11.798
I think,
uh, no.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.669
I think there's been
a bit of a mistake

24:13.669 --> 24:16.411
because there
is no way that I...

24:16.890 --> 24:17.934
Me?

24:28.423 --> 24:29.598
Thanks, everyone.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.513
This has been
very informative,

24:31.513 --> 24:34.211
but I have a Colosseum
tour at 5 p.m.,

24:34.211 --> 24:36.866
- so I gotta go get a cab.
- No, you can't leave.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.607
If the boss says
you are the boss,

24:38.607 --> 24:40.827
- you are the boss
now, <i>comprende?
- Yeah,</i> yeah but

24:40.827 --> 24:42.611
you know what?
I am not a boss,

24:42.611 --> 24:45.222
like, not in any way,
shape or form,

24:45.222 --> 24:47.964
so, you know, especially
not in a Mafia kind of way.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.707
I should be the boss!

24:51.707 --> 24:53.579
Yes, yes. Good idea.
He should be the boss.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.885
I mean, who am I to steal
anyone's boss thunder?

24:55.885 --> 24:57.887
Besides, I've got a lot
of shit going on at home,

24:57.887 --> 24:59.062
my son just
went to college

24:59.062 --> 25:01.630
and my husband
just cheated on me, so...

25:01.630 --> 25:03.502
You want we should
take care of him? Hmm?

25:04.590 --> 25:06.113
Mmm?
- No!

25:07.593 --> 25:08.768
No.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.944
No, God, no, no.
I just need a vacation,

25:10.944 --> 25:13.120
I just really want
my Eat, Pray, Fuck!

25:13.120 --> 25:14.513
Eat, Pray, Fuck?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.210
Yeah, it's a play
on words,

25:16.210 --> 25:17.864
you know, the book,
<i>Eat, Pray, Love?</i>

25:17.864 --> 25:20.257
Yeah, it's a very uplifting

25:20.257 --> 25:21.955
and moving memoir by...

25:23.260 --> 25:24.523
Elizabeth Gilbert.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.439
Yes! Yes, see, he knows.

25:28.439 --> 25:31.442
Yeah, I wanna make wine,
and I wanna eat pasta,

25:31.442 --> 25:33.619
and be romanced, and...

25:33.619 --> 25:35.795
But you came for a funeral.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.885
Yeah. I mean, you know,

25:38.885 --> 25:40.451
- after the funeral.

25:42.018 --> 25:43.585
Hello?

25:43.585 --> 25:45.674
Lorenzo. It's Lorenzo,
I should take this.
How are you?

25:45.674 --> 25:48.285
- Give me this.
- Hey, what? No.
What? No, no, no, no!

25:48.285 --> 25:49.852
Oh, my God.
I just paid that off!

25:49.852 --> 25:51.288
I won't get another
upgrade for a year

25:51.288 --> 25:53.334
and how is Lorenzo supposed
to get in touch with me?

25:53.334 --> 25:54.640
How will I ever have sex?

25:57.947 --> 26:00.689
You cannot be speaking
to random strangers.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.299
It's too dangerous.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.866
He's not a stranger,

26:03.866 --> 26:06.129
he's gorgeous.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.223
Okay.

26:13.833 --> 26:14.834
You know what?

26:15.530 --> 26:17.358
I'm done.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.447
- Bye.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.626
Kristin!

26:26.280 --> 26:28.021
Kristin!

26:28.021 --> 26:30.327
You can't run away
from your destiny.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.764
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.725
Which way is it?

26:37.552 --> 26:38.553
It's that way!

26:39.162 --> 26:40.599
But I must warn you,

26:40.599 --> 26:42.470
once you walk out those gates,

26:42.470 --> 26:44.951
you will no longer
be under our protection.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.041
Also, you have no phone.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.014
You said you
wanted to learn

27:05.014 --> 27:06.973
how to make wine, yes?

27:09.932 --> 27:12.979
We have machines
to crush grapes now,

27:12.979 --> 27:14.458
but this is the classic way.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.330
This does feel kinda nice, huh?

27:16.330 --> 27:18.419
You must stomp on the grapes

27:18.419 --> 27:20.856
- to release their juices.
- Yes.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.033
And you must also take over

27:24.033 --> 27:25.948
as the Balbano family boss.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.428
This is insane.

27:27.428 --> 27:28.734
Where would I even begin?

27:29.343 --> 27:30.953
Shh. Come here.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.086
Are we actually the Mafia?

27:34.522 --> 27:37.699
Your grandfather
preferred to call it

27:37.699 --> 27:40.571
the "invisible family."

27:40.571 --> 27:41.660
- Oh, that's spooky.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.838
Invisible but strong,

27:45.838 --> 27:48.057
and we can't
appear weakened.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.755
So, you must go
to a meeting

27:49.755 --> 27:51.278
with our enemies,

27:51.278 --> 27:52.671
the Romanos.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.412
What, the... the people
who shot at us earlier?

27:55.412 --> 27:57.632
Oh!
I mean, can't Fabrizio go?

27:57.632 --> 27:59.329
It seems like
he would love this stuff.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.028
It can't be Fabrizio.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.726
He started the shootout.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.554
He's a hot-head

28:06.554 --> 28:08.338
- with a horrible temper.
- Hmm.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.036
Just like Sonny.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.212
Who's Sonny?

28:12.212 --> 28:13.735
From <i>The Godfather.</i>

28:13.735 --> 28:16.129
Oh, right. Yeah.
I never saw <i>The Godfather.</i>

28:22.309 --> 28:23.919
Oh, my God.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.095
Okay, look, it's really hard
to find three and a half hours.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.575
All you need to do

28:27.575 --> 28:29.708
is offer their new Don

28:29.708 --> 28:31.535
a part of the east.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.756
- Something your grandfather
was too stubborn to part with.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.803
Please, we need someone

28:37.803 --> 28:39.674
who's level-headed,

28:40.196 --> 28:41.763
empathetic

28:41.763 --> 28:43.939
- and unassuming.
- Did you just call me pathetic?

28:47.638 --> 28:49.989
We need you.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.382
No, I will never
be ready. No. No.

28:52.382 --> 28:55.385
Also, we will give you
a new phone...

28:55.385 --> 28:56.604
Oh. Oh, oh.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.650
...so you can go
Eat, Pray, Fuck Lorenzo

28:59.650 --> 29:01.957
once we finish
the background check.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.176
- Background check?
Yeah.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.526
Lorenzo Villaguzi, aged 33.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.875
Oh, my God,
he's quite young.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.703
- Men do it all the time.
- That's true.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.618
He's born in Milano.
- Which we don't like.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.054
Yeah, but it's okay, Dante.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.535
- Yeah, Dante.
- And he's recently divorced.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.104
Jackpot! Oh, my God!

29:19.845 --> 29:22.935
- Oh, my God,
that's really good news.
- This is your new phone.

29:23.587 --> 29:24.719
Yee!

29:24.719 --> 29:26.155
- It's untraceable.
- Okay.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.377
You meet with
Don Romano tonight

29:30.377 --> 29:33.162
and then you can do
what you want with Lorenzo.

29:34.860 --> 29:35.948
Deal?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.427
Oh...

29:38.472 --> 29:39.865
Uh...

29:39.865 --> 29:41.170
- Yes, deal. Deal.

29:44.652 --> 29:48.308
<i>Presenting
the new Donna Balbano.</i>

29:54.618 --> 29:55.663
You look like

29:55.663 --> 29:58.666
a librarian from a library,

29:58.666 --> 30:00.450
not a porno.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.324
Darling, come with me.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.479
Again,

30:29.479 --> 30:34.223
presenting <i>la bellissima</i>
Donna Balbano.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.448
Oh, my God, Valentino.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.841
Hello.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.060
- Yes.
- Turn around,
turn, turn.

30:45.626 --> 30:46.801
Hey.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.064
- And that's what you wear

30:49.064 --> 30:50.457
to meet a mob boss.

30:58.987 --> 31:01.337
- You guys are gonna stay
with me the whole time, right?
- Yes.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.599
- Of course.
- Okay, don't leave me.

31:02.599 --> 31:03.905
Don't worry, Kristin.

31:03.905 --> 31:04.906
Okay.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.432
I'm Giannina.
I'll be your server tonight.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.478
- Oh, I love
your glasses, Giannina.
- Thank you.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.619
This is for your bag.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.839
Oh, it's so cute.
Little monkey.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.885
All right.

31:27.537 --> 31:28.538
Thank you.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.730
You're not Fabrizio.

31:48.994 --> 31:52.127
And you are not
what I was expecting.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.607
I was told
I would be meeting

31:53.607 --> 31:55.609
with the new Balbano
family boss.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.219
Yeah, that's me.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.394
Kristin. The new boss.

32:12.582 --> 32:13.627
Ah.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.413
I apologize
for my rudeness.

32:17.413 --> 32:18.458
Oh, no, not at all.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.025
But, you know...

32:22.462 --> 32:25.421
it was...
it was a bit of a shock

32:25.421 --> 32:26.814
to see a beautiful woman.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.210
Stop.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.690
Oh, I'm sorry.
I am Carlo Romano,

32:33.690 --> 32:35.040
the new boss.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.564
Oh, well, there you go.
We're both new bosses,

32:37.564 --> 32:39.218
we have so much in common.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.349
Look at that.

32:41.133 --> 32:44.179
So, what were you thinking?

32:44.179 --> 32:45.789
I was hoping
to try gnocchi.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.704
I love gnocchi

32:47.704 --> 32:49.402
and I promised myself
if I ever came to Italy,

32:49.402 --> 32:51.273
I would eat as much
gnocchi as I could.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.101
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.103
- I meant the territories.
- Hmm?

32:56.148 --> 32:58.977
Oh, right, yes. Sorry, I...

32:58.977 --> 33:00.282
Okay, Google,

33:00.282 --> 33:01.892
open notes. Um,

33:01.892 --> 33:04.765
so you can take the north and...

33:04.765 --> 33:08.812
part of the east
extending to... Form-i-a?

33:10.162 --> 33:11.163
Formia.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.774
Formia.

33:13.774 --> 33:14.905
Yes.

33:15.863 --> 33:16.907
That's it.

33:25.742 --> 33:26.874
Thank you, Giannina.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.050
She's sweet.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.270
I ordered every gnocchi
on the menu.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.228
Oh, my God,
someone's a good listener.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.664
<i>Prego.</i>

33:35.361 --> 33:37.885
Oh... Well...

33:40.366 --> 33:42.063
Try.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.934
You... You want me
to try it first?

33:43.934 --> 33:45.153
Yeah.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.112
Well, no pressure. Okay.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.945
That is delicious.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.687
This is the best wine
I have ever had in my life.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.949
<i>Salute.</i>

34:00.125 --> 34:01.300
<i>Salute.</i>

34:07.480 --> 34:11.092
Listen, listen, listen.
It's Oreo.

34:11.092 --> 34:14.400
They're two chocolate biscuits
held together...

34:15.923 --> 34:17.403
with cream?

34:17.403 --> 34:21.146
The cream...
The cream is my favorite part.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.064
Uh, listen...

34:27.239 --> 34:29.763
um, about your offer.

34:31.156 --> 34:34.985
Are you sure we have to
stop at Formia? Hmm?

34:34.985 --> 34:37.249
Hmm, well, that's what it says
in my notes.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.121
Of course.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.388
In your notes.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.653
Do you like limoncello?

34:50.653 --> 34:53.091
Oh, I'm more of
a cherry jello person.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.137
Oh. No, no, no. Limoncello.

34:56.137 --> 35:00.924
It is, um,
it is a dessert liquor.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.927
Oh. Oh, no, I don't know it.

35:03.927 --> 35:07.670
We'll have it
in my hotel room. Upstairs.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.759
- Hmm?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.250
All clear, boss.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.167
Okay. Well, um,
you guys can wait outside

35:26.167 --> 35:28.778
while we finish our business.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.912
We don't think
this is a good idea.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.828
Would you say that
to a male mob boss? No.

35:34.828 --> 35:39.441
Please! It's been
three long years. Come on.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.969
Thank you. Yes!

35:47.841 --> 35:49.756
<i>Ciao.</i>

35:57.677 --> 36:00.419
Oh, come on. Oh, my God.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.776
Oh, you know what?
I don't think I can hold on.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.256
I've just gotta pee
real quick.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.561
- I know. I'm sorry.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.215
I'll make it real quick.
Come on. Ah!

36:14.215 --> 36:15.695
All right.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.178
Okay.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.418
Right.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.463
So much better.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.248
There she is.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.609
- Oh.

37:43.609 --> 37:46.438
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.701
Oh, so sorry,
I must take this.

37:48.701 --> 37:51.399
Oh, no, it's fine. It's fine.

37:51.399 --> 37:52.922
- Wait.
- I will.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.470
Let's try this again.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.428
Oh, okay.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.741
<i>Salute.</i>

38:34.399 --> 38:36.923
Oh, Oh, yeah.

38:41.144 --> 38:46.019
Oh, my God. If you told me
three days ago

38:46.019 --> 38:49.239
that I would be in
a hotel room in Italy
with a

38:49.239 --> 38:51.590
handsome mob boss,

38:51.590 --> 38:53.679
then I would say
you are crazy.

38:53.679 --> 38:54.897
But here I am!

38:54.897 --> 38:56.899
Yes. Yes, but not for long.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.249
Oh, don't remind me.
I fly home
at the end of the week

38:59.249 --> 39:00.468
and there's still so much
I wanna see.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.818
I wanna go to
the Amalfi coast. Pompei.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.690
The <i>Vaticano!</i>

39:06.126 --> 39:08.302
Too bad you won't see
any of those things.

39:08.302 --> 39:11.871
Oh, no? Why? Because we'll be
too busy making love?

39:15.657 --> 39:19.400
Don Romano does not
make love to dead women.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.142
What?

39:22.142 --> 39:24.971
The poison I put in your drink

39:24.971 --> 39:27.452
should be travelling
to your heart by now.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.367
- Oh, my God.
- Soon,

39:30.368 --> 39:31.760
your lungs will collapse.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.196
Oh, my God.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.464
Oh, my God. No...

39:40.900 --> 39:42.336
Hey, Aldo!

39:48.298 --> 39:50.257
You are a Balbano.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.694
My uncle killed your father.

39:52.694 --> 39:56.219
One day you will come for me
and the rest of my family.

39:56.219 --> 39:59.092
Eventually,
we all seek revenge...

40:01.790 --> 40:03.313
like Vito Corleone.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.663
I never saw <i>The Godfather.</i>

40:05.446 --> 40:09.929
No! It was
<i>The Godfather Part Two!</i>

40:09.929 --> 40:11.234
Okay, okay.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.453
Stupid American woman!

40:13.628 --> 40:16.022
Your family is in chaos.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.720
Soon the Romanos
will be the only...

40:22.681 --> 40:25.466
...southern family here...

40:25.466 --> 40:27.250
in... in...

40:30.384 --> 40:31.907
...in Lazio.

40:33.256 --> 40:34.301
Are you okay?

40:35.302 --> 40:36.434
Am I okay?

40:37.173 --> 40:38.174
I'm okay.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.090
Oh, my God.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.179
- Right.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.052
I switched our glasses
while you were on the phone.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.533
I'm so sorry.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.796
It's just that you poured me
a way bigger portion

40:50.796 --> 40:53.189
and I didn't know if
I was gonna like limoncello.

40:53.189 --> 40:54.800
And I didn't wanna be rude because,

40:54.800 --> 40:57.019
typically I don't
like lemon-flavored things.

40:57.019 --> 40:59.674
I think it's because I took
a lot of lemon-flavored
Augmentin when I was a child.

40:59.674 --> 41:01.633
It's an antibiotic
and it's really disgusting.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.162
- Oh.

41:10.598 --> 41:11.904
Three years.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.560
- Ooh.
- Ah.

41:17.779 --> 41:21.130
Oh, my God!
What do I do?

41:21.914 --> 41:23.306
What do I do?

41:24.525 --> 41:26.353
Jenny.
Oh, my God, yeah, of course.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.051
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.
Please, Jenny, please.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.880
Please answer the phone.
Please, please God.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.795
Oh, please answer. Okay.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.928
Sven. Yeah.
[OVER PHONE] <i>Oh.</i>

41:39.279 --> 41:41.368
Okay, think about it.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.805
<i>- Okay, Jenny.</i>
- Yeah. Okay.

41:43.805 --> 41:47.461
Hey, hey.
Find any hot Italian men yet?

41:47.461 --> 41:50.203
Uh, yes. Lorenzo.

41:50.203 --> 41:54.033
- You fuck him yet?
- Uh, he tried to kill me. And...

41:54.033 --> 41:55.513
With his penis?

41:55.513 --> 41:58.037
What? No, no, with poison. I...

41:58.037 --> 41:59.952
A poisoned penis?

42:00.909 --> 42:02.694
Slow down. Lorenzo did what?

42:02.694 --> 42:05.087
No, no. Not Lorenzo. Carlo.

42:05.087 --> 42:06.306
Wait, who the fuck is Carlo?

42:06.306 --> 42:08.743
Oh, my God. He is this
super-hot mob boss

42:08.743 --> 42:10.963
who I had dinner with.
But then he tried to poison me.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.138
So, I switched our drinks.

42:12.138 --> 42:13.574
<i>And now he's dead.</i>

42:13.574 --> 42:15.141
<i>Could I go to jail for this?</i>

42:15.141 --> 42:17.099
No. A little poison
switch-a-roo?

42:17.099 --> 42:18.840
It's classic self-defense.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.495
Oh, my God,
I killed a Mafia boss.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.149
I am a dead woman.

42:33.725 --> 42:34.987
Everything okay
in there?

42:36.466 --> 42:37.816
- Oh, my God.

42:41.950 --> 42:44.213
Oh, my God.

42:46.868 --> 42:48.304
Ah!

42:59.054 --> 43:00.969
You are terrible
at playing dead.

43:02.710 --> 43:05.931
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God, it's you.

43:05.931 --> 43:10.022
- Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you
so much.
- Kristin, please stop.

43:10.022 --> 43:12.372
Oh, my God. Thank you.

43:13.373 --> 43:15.201
Is that a cannoli
in your pocket?

43:18.465 --> 43:21.729
So you fucked him?
No, he died first.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.993
You missed something.

43:24.993 --> 43:28.127
When he came,
he screamed like a woman.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.652
You... Right.

43:31.652 --> 43:35.482
Um, well, I guess
that might have been fun?

43:37.266 --> 43:39.225
- You took a shower?
- Yes.

43:39.225 --> 43:42.794
I took a shower
because it usually
calms me down, but...

43:42.794 --> 43:44.360
I've never seen
a dead body before.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.014
And now I've seen three.
Three!

43:46.014 --> 43:47.581
I mean,
I live a very boring life.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.670
I am such a boring person.
I'm a boring woman.

43:49.670 --> 43:51.585
Seriously, I don't do anything
with my life. I don't go out.

43:51.585 --> 43:53.152
I just do everything
for everybody else.

43:53.152 --> 43:55.894
Those monsters
will stop at nothing

43:55.894 --> 43:57.460
until we're all dead

43:57.460 --> 43:59.288
and they're the only family
in Lazio.

43:59.288 --> 44:01.595
I have an idea.
I think I should go home.

44:01.595 --> 44:02.727
I don't think I belong here.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.425
- Did you not hear me?
- What?

44:05.425 --> 44:07.296
If you leave now,
they will follow you

44:07.296 --> 44:09.342
and they will not stop
until you're dead.

44:10.604 --> 44:11.866
This is good.

44:11.866 --> 44:14.086
How? How is this good?

44:14.086 --> 44:18.003
This will send a message
to the Romanos
that our family is strong.

44:18.003 --> 44:21.310
You're the boss. And the boss
takes care of business.

44:21.310 --> 44:22.572
You did good.

44:22.572 --> 44:25.140
What? I murdered someone!

44:25.140 --> 44:26.402
<i>- Brava.
- Brava.</i>

44:26.402 --> 44:27.926
No, no, no, no.

44:27.926 --> 44:30.189
Do not <i>"brava"</i> me. I am bad.
I did a bad thing.

44:30.189 --> 44:32.713
Oh, my God, I just want
my <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

44:36.848 --> 44:38.110
What is he...

44:45.770 --> 44:48.207
<i>Ciao,</i> Carletto.

45:36.385 --> 45:37.386
Bruno!

46:06.198 --> 46:07.242
Mmm.

46:12.726 --> 46:15.642
We have to kill those Romanos
before they kill us!

46:15.642 --> 46:16.774
And I mean on purpose!

46:16.774 --> 46:18.645
No more accidentally
saving the day!

46:18.645 --> 46:20.038
You could be a little
nicer to me, you know.

46:20.038 --> 46:21.300
I just killed someone.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.476
I'm a very good person.
I'm a good mother.

46:23.476 --> 46:24.564
I would do anything
for my son.

46:24.564 --> 46:25.870
I do everything for everyone.

46:25.870 --> 46:27.349
Even animals,
I can't even kill a bug.

46:27.349 --> 46:29.090
I put it under a little cup,
and I take it outside,

46:29.090 --> 46:31.832
and whisper, "Go. Be free.
Go live your life."

46:31.832 --> 46:34.269
And I imagine them building
a new home and a new life.

46:34.269 --> 46:37.272
How are we supposed to appear
strong when she is...

46:38.012 --> 46:39.535
this?

46:39.535 --> 46:42.408
These Romanos will never
negotiate peace on good terms.

46:42.408 --> 46:44.845
Why are we negotiating at all?
Why don't we just give them
what they want?

46:46.455 --> 46:48.849
They want control
over all of our territories.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.329
So, why don't we just
give it to them?

46:50.329 --> 46:52.505
How do you expect us
to make money?

46:52.505 --> 46:53.985
I don't know!

46:56.770 --> 46:58.337
What is it we do, anyway?

46:58.337 --> 46:59.991
Drugs.
Counterfeit bags.

46:59.991 --> 47:01.470
Guns. Gambling.

47:01.470 --> 47:05.474
Uh, so far I have heard
nothing that is either legal

47:05.474 --> 47:07.085
or moral.

47:08.434 --> 47:10.175
Because...  you know,

47:11.045 --> 47:13.221
we are the fucking Mafia!

47:13.221 --> 47:14.832
You...

47:18.836 --> 47:22.709
Let him go. He just needs
to blow off some steam.

47:22.709 --> 47:26.191
Oh, yeah? So do I.
I am completely overwhelmed!

47:26.191 --> 47:28.889
This is supposed to be
my vacation.

47:28.889 --> 47:30.891
- What are you doing?
- I'm confirming my date

47:30.891 --> 47:31.979
with Lorenzo
because that was the deal.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.633
But we are
in the middle of a war.

47:33.633 --> 47:35.896
No. You are
in the middle of a war.

47:35.896 --> 47:37.898
I am sick of doing everything
for everybody else!

47:37.898 --> 47:39.639
I'm gonna do something for me.

47:39.639 --> 47:41.597
You cannot be
in public right now.

47:41.597 --> 47:42.903
Oh, I'm not going to be
in public.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.687
I'm going to have dinner
at his place.

47:44.687 --> 47:46.733
He is simple and adorable.

47:46.733 --> 47:48.953
And... I just wanna be
alone with him.

47:53.044 --> 47:54.915
These are my cousins.

47:54.915 --> 47:57.787
I come from
a very conservative family

47:57.787 --> 47:59.833
and they wanna protect...

48:01.574 --> 48:02.923
my virtue.

48:08.363 --> 48:11.323
I guess it will
be a family affair. Please.

48:11.323 --> 48:13.499
Okay. Thank you.

48:13.499 --> 48:15.370
- It's good to see you.
- It's so good to see you.

48:17.633 --> 48:21.420
Hi. Thank you for having us
in your home
which is beautiful.

48:21.420 --> 48:25.119
- Welcome to my aunt's place.
Oh, my God,
it's totally magical.

48:25.119 --> 48:26.686
Yeah.

48:26.686 --> 48:29.602
Who is this? He looks like
such a naughty little hobbit.

48:29.602 --> 48:31.952
- Yeah. It's my uncle, Ernesto.
- Oh.

48:31.952 --> 48:34.737
- He recently died.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

48:34.737 --> 48:37.175
Yes, we are.
That's why I moved in.

48:37.175 --> 48:39.481
- Oh, I see.
- But I am

48:39.481 --> 48:42.832
naming my own pasta line
this year.

48:42.832 --> 48:44.878
- This is your pasta line?
- It is.

48:44.878 --> 48:46.706
Oh, my God,
that is so exciting.

48:46.706 --> 48:48.577
You guys, look at this.
This is his.

48:54.670 --> 48:57.499
Oh, Lord in Heaven,
I have never eaten

48:57.499 --> 48:59.023
homemade pasta before.

48:59.023 --> 49:01.112
Mmm, so good.

49:05.638 --> 49:07.988
You know, it's... it's nice

49:07.988 --> 49:10.512
to be with a woman
who appreciates my cooking.

49:11.600 --> 49:12.775
Yeah. My ex never did.

49:12.775 --> 49:14.821
Ah, she sounds like a monster.

49:14.821 --> 49:18.216
Oh, no. I didn't mean to
bring her up again. Forget it.

49:18.216 --> 49:20.218
No, it's okay. I get it.

49:20.218 --> 49:22.611
I mean, my husband,
my ex-husband

49:22.611 --> 49:24.222
was a total man-child.

49:24.222 --> 49:26.659
I mean, he made everything
about himself.

49:26.659 --> 49:28.922
And his band
and his cheesy lyrics.

49:28.922 --> 49:30.445
That sounds horrible.

49:40.281 --> 49:42.631
I'd convinced myself that

49:42.631 --> 49:47.332
his passion
was more important than mine.
Like an idiot.

49:47.332 --> 49:48.637
But even with our son,

49:48.637 --> 49:50.422
divorcing Paul,
I swear to God,

49:50.422 --> 49:52.119
it was the best decision
I ever made.

49:52.119 --> 49:53.425
Oh, you have a child?

49:53.425 --> 49:56.167
Yes! Yes, I'll show you.
Here he is.

49:56.167 --> 49:59.126
There. That's Domenick.
He's my baby.

49:59.126 --> 50:01.476
He's a really good kid.

50:11.530 --> 50:13.053
Last bite.

50:13.053 --> 50:14.228
For me?

50:14.228 --> 50:16.056
The most precious. Yes.

50:16.056 --> 50:17.101
Okay.

50:25.413 --> 50:28.068
Oh, your pasta.

50:28.068 --> 50:30.331
It's the greatest thing
I've ever had in my mouth.

50:30.331 --> 50:31.898
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

50:38.557 --> 50:39.601
Are your cousins
okay with this?

50:39.601 --> 50:40.863
Yeah, they're fine.
Just kiss me.

50:40.863 --> 50:42.561
- Shit. No, no, no.

50:42.561 --> 50:44.041
Oh, God, I forgot.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.781
I've got this
work Zoom meeting.

50:46.391 --> 50:48.306
Oh, my God. Cousins!

50:48.306 --> 50:51.091
I have to go. Rain check?
I'm sorry. I just...

50:51.091 --> 50:52.353
It's a really
important meeting that I...

50:53.528 --> 50:55.313
I totally forgot about it. Um...

50:55.313 --> 50:57.750
Thank you for having us.
I will call you.

51:04.757 --> 51:07.629
I can't believe this.
Stupid work.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.109
I'm enjoying myself
for the first time in years,

51:09.109 --> 51:10.937
and I have to do this
dumb work Zoom.

51:10.937 --> 51:13.157
Come on. Quit your job.
You are a boss now.

51:13.157 --> 51:15.681
Oh. I can't just quit my job.
People are counting on me.

51:15.681 --> 51:17.030
Hmm.
Ma.

51:23.776 --> 51:25.212
Ma.

51:25.212 --> 51:27.127
Are you okay?

51:27.127 --> 51:29.129
My mother had
another dizzy spell

51:29.129 --> 51:32.350
and she has no more medication
now. Okay. Okay?

51:32.350 --> 51:35.527
She can't afford it.
The SSN doesn't cover these
new American drugs.

51:38.007 --> 51:39.313
I know a pharmacist.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.923
We go tomorrow, okay?

51:40.923 --> 51:42.795
No, no, you should go tonight.
Go take care of it tonight.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.144
Yeah, but we must protect you.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.537
- He is right.
- No, family first.

51:45.537 --> 51:46.581
I'm okay. I'll be fine.

51:47.974 --> 51:49.149
Oh, Kristin.

51:49.932 --> 51:51.020
Would you mind to put this

51:51.020 --> 51:52.109
- into the fridge, please?
- Yes, sure.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.206
Come on. So late.

52:02.206 --> 52:04.382
Okay.

52:04.382 --> 52:06.253
Here we go.

52:09.952 --> 52:11.171
Oh.

52:11.171 --> 52:14.522
I can't wear this.
Oh, what am I... Oh, God.

52:18.613 --> 52:20.137
Ugh, right. Uh...

52:21.399 --> 52:23.705
Come on, hurry, quick, quick!

52:27.970 --> 52:28.971
Okay.

52:33.193 --> 52:35.543
<i>Hey, nice of you
to finally join us.</i>

52:35.543 --> 52:37.415
Sorry, the...

52:37.415 --> 52:39.678
the time difference
is a little crazy, so...

52:39.678 --> 52:41.680
<i>So, where are we
with Restylane?</i>

52:41.680 --> 52:43.943
Right, yes, okay.
Um, so first:

52:43.943 --> 52:46.424
Restylane makes women feel
great about themselves, right?

52:46.424 --> 52:48.034
So, I was thinking
we open on a woman

52:48.034 --> 52:50.645
<i>alone, drinking some
fine wine,</i>

52:50.645 --> 52:52.821
<i>longingly perusing
a travel brochure.</i>

52:52.821 --> 52:54.562
Mmm. I'm not really hearing
anything that pops.

52:54.562 --> 52:56.695
I mean, you know,
you gotta grab them
in the first few seconds.

52:56.695 --> 52:59.263
<i>But I just started.</i>

52:59.263 --> 53:02.222
Hey, you know who's
really great at this?

53:02.222 --> 53:04.659
Just riff, give us some of
that Randy magic.

53:04.659 --> 53:05.921
Go ahead and mute her.

53:09.621 --> 53:10.709
All right.

53:10.709 --> 53:11.971
Help me!

53:11.971 --> 53:13.277
And I'm just spitballing,
all right.

53:13.277 --> 53:15.496
But I'm thinking,
woman on a jet-ski?

53:15.496 --> 53:16.628
Aw, that's fresh.

53:16.628 --> 53:18.412
Yeah, but how do we get there?

53:18.412 --> 53:21.459
No! S.O.S.!

53:21.459 --> 53:24.462
We open up on this attractive
but, you know, older woman.

53:24.462 --> 53:25.941
Not too old, right?

53:25.941 --> 53:27.334
Help me!

53:27.334 --> 53:30.207
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no, no, please.

53:30.207 --> 53:33.993
I'm thinking tight, hot,
early forties type role,
you know what I'm saying?

53:33.993 --> 53:35.734
- Oh, my God.

53:35.734 --> 53:38.563
You are much more attractive
than your grandfather.

53:38.563 --> 53:40.042
Oh, my God.

53:41.479 --> 53:42.610
No!  No, no!

53:44.046 --> 53:45.918
So, you know,
she minding her business,

53:45.918 --> 53:47.354
walking through the desert
like people do.

53:47.354 --> 53:50.009
That's a great
metaphor for a tired woman

53:50.009 --> 53:51.967
with a face
that's so marked by time.

53:51.967 --> 53:53.273
- Mmm.

53:53.273 --> 53:55.188
- Sit down!

53:55.188 --> 53:57.669
No, no, no. Please don't.

53:57.669 --> 54:00.454
Please don't hurt me.
Please. No, no.

54:00.454 --> 54:04.850
Oh, God, no. No <i>entrata.</i>
Absolutely no <i>entrata.</i> No.

54:04.850 --> 54:07.374
You like
<i>salsiccia e friarelli?</i>

54:07.374 --> 54:11.291
No. No sausages.
I'm strictly <i>vegetariano.</i>
No, thank you.

54:11.291 --> 54:13.206
Very spicy.

54:13.206 --> 54:16.035
Spicy? Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. No!

54:16.035 --> 54:19.168
- Please, no. Please don't. No.

54:19.168 --> 54:21.301
No, no, no.
Please don't.

54:22.607 --> 54:23.782
No, no, no.

54:24.696 --> 54:26.175
Fucking belt.

54:26.175 --> 54:29.570
She looks lonely. She looks...

54:29.570 --> 54:31.398
- She looks her age, bro.
- She does.

54:31.398 --> 54:33.182
No woman should look her age.

54:37.056 --> 54:38.971
Crotch! Eye!

54:38.971 --> 54:40.625
- Crotch! Eye!

54:40.625 --> 54:41.930
And like a blessing
from the heavens,

54:41.930 --> 54:43.671
the sky opens up
and it starts to rain.

54:43.671 --> 54:44.977
Then she looks down
and she realizes,

54:44.977 --> 54:46.413
"Oh, my God,
I'm on a jet-ski."

54:46.413 --> 54:49.155
Restylane Lyft
gives her a second youth.

54:49.155 --> 54:51.549
Yeah.
- A return to life.

54:51.549 --> 54:52.680
I love that pose.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.247
Crotch! Crotch!

54:54.247 --> 54:56.075
- Eye! Crotch!

54:57.076 --> 54:59.731
Restylane Kysse
plumps her lips.

54:59.731 --> 55:01.863
Crotch! Eye!

55:06.999 --> 55:08.870
<i>Makes them kissable.</i>

55:08.870 --> 55:10.045
<i>Rejuvenated.</i>

55:14.963 --> 55:16.748
You got water,
you got wetness.

55:16.748 --> 55:17.923
Whole lot of wetness.

55:20.229 --> 55:21.666
Fuck you!

55:21.666 --> 55:24.495
When was the last time
you saw a thigh gap like that?

55:24.495 --> 55:27.324
Fuck you, Randy!

55:27.324 --> 55:30.065
- Now she's kissable.
- Oh, fuck you, Wayne!

55:31.023 --> 55:33.460
- Wow.
- Oh, fuck you, Hank!

55:36.071 --> 55:38.900
And you,
you fucking creepy pervert!

55:38.900 --> 55:40.380
Fuck you!

55:42.600 --> 55:46.212
<i>And then she just
rides off into the distance.</i>

55:46.212 --> 55:48.170
<i>- Soft, youthful...</i>

55:48.867 --> 55:50.564
<i>...and wet.</i>

55:54.176 --> 55:55.917
<i>Randy, that was superb.</i>

55:55.917 --> 55:57.092
Okay.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.486
See that, Kristin?

55:59.486 --> 56:01.009
<i>That's how it's done.</i>

56:01.967 --> 56:03.142
<i>Unmute.</i>

56:04.535 --> 56:06.406
<i>Kristin.</i>

56:06.406 --> 56:07.886
Hey, tell me
you heard Randy's pitch.

56:09.235 --> 56:11.237
Oh, Kristin?

56:12.456 --> 56:13.587
Are you drunk?

56:15.502 --> 56:19.854
Oh, man. I really hoped
this day would never come

56:19.854 --> 56:22.291
but I'm gonna have to
let you go.

56:22.291 --> 56:25.382
By the way, you have some
pasta sauce on your face.

56:27.427 --> 56:28.863
<i>You know what?</i>

56:28.863 --> 56:30.561
<i>Fuck you!</i>

56:30.561 --> 56:33.781
Whoa!
That's gratitude for you.

56:33.781 --> 56:35.043
- Highly unnecessary.
- Toxic.

56:38.482 --> 56:40.353
Oh, God.

58:01.042 --> 58:04.002
Hmm?

58:04.002 --> 58:06.134
You left quite a mess
at the villa.

58:06.134 --> 58:08.528
You need to tell us
when things like this happen,

58:08.528 --> 58:10.269
so we don't have to worry

58:10.269 --> 58:12.532
whether or not
you are currently alive.

58:12.532 --> 58:14.708
Oh, fine. So, next time
someone tries to murder me,

58:14.708 --> 58:15.883
I'll be sure to let you know.

58:15.883 --> 58:17.624
<i>Grazie.</i>

58:17.624 --> 58:20.235
Now, the Romanos
want to meet today.

58:20.235 --> 58:23.412
Oh, so they can
try to kill me again? Huh!

58:23.412 --> 58:26.677
I thought once you'd had sex,
you would calm down a bit.

58:26.677 --> 58:27.939
Hey, I've been here two days

58:27.939 --> 58:29.288
and I've been almost
murdered twice.

58:29.288 --> 58:30.594
That's one per day.

58:30.594 --> 58:32.987
I'm gonna need a lot more sex
to calm me down!

58:32.987 --> 58:34.293
I know a man.

58:35.599 --> 58:38.297
Stop with your cousin, please.

58:38.297 --> 58:40.647
They're prepared
to make some concessions.

58:40.647 --> 58:42.257
We have the upper hand.

58:42.257 --> 58:44.477
They've agreed
to a public meeting.

58:44.477 --> 58:46.218
Fabrizio will be there
with you.

58:46.218 --> 58:49.221
I can't be there
because it's only family.

58:49.221 --> 58:51.484
Fine. But I wanna meet
at La Bottega del Gelato

58:51.484 --> 58:52.920
because it has
a five-star rating.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.532
And I never have gelato.
And I have been dying to go!

58:55.532 --> 58:57.490
- But we have...
- That's an order!

58:58.491 --> 59:00.928
Mmm. Mmm!

59:00.928 --> 59:04.410
Look, I am tired of this war.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.368
Oh, my gosh,
Tripadvisor does not lie.

59:06.368 --> 59:08.675
My family
is tired of this war.

59:09.284 --> 59:10.721
It's got to stop.

59:10.721 --> 59:13.158
We couldn't
agree more.

59:13.158 --> 59:17.510
You killed our boss,
and our best killer.

59:18.032 --> 59:20.078
All by yourself.

59:20.078 --> 59:22.471
Does your offer
for Formia stand?

59:23.690 --> 59:25.866
Yes. <i>Absoluto.</i>

59:28.173 --> 59:31.480
So, we are at peace
then, Mammone?

59:38.183 --> 59:39.576
We are at peace...

59:43.057 --> 59:44.363
Donna Balbano.

59:56.505 --> 59:57.681
Oh.

1:00:04.470 --> 1:00:05.645
Well, there you go.

1:00:06.646 --> 1:00:08.039
Can I get
another scoop?

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.153
You really impressed me.

1:00:35.153 --> 1:00:36.850
Oh, yeah, the meeting

1:00:36.850 --> 1:00:38.547
went better
than I thought it would.

1:00:38.547 --> 1:00:40.419
Because you terrified them.

1:00:40.419 --> 1:00:43.988
Last night
was a true work of art.

1:00:45.424 --> 1:00:48.035
You have rage, Kristin.

1:00:48.949 --> 1:00:50.472
Wild,

1:00:50.472 --> 1:00:52.953
passionate, deep rage.

1:00:54.476 --> 1:00:55.564
I like it.

1:00:57.175 --> 1:01:00.613
Okay.

1:01:02.136 --> 1:01:04.443
You know,
it wasn't just blood on Bruno.

1:01:05.749 --> 1:01:09.187
It was mushy, thick.

1:01:09.187 --> 1:01:13.365
Bits of his scrotum
were stuffed in his eye socket.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:14.845
Mmm.

1:01:16.368 --> 1:01:18.631
And that's why
they listened to you.

1:01:18.631 --> 1:01:21.416
Because he had
bits of his scrotum
stuffed in his eye socket?

1:01:22.243 --> 1:01:23.854
Maybe.

1:01:23.854 --> 1:01:26.683
And that's how
you earned <i>rispetto.</i>

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:30.425
You'll fit
right into this family!

1:01:31.862 --> 1:01:33.080
Give me your hand.

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:35.300
What, uh...

1:01:36.344 --> 1:01:38.216
Oh, no. Oh, no,
you don't have to.

1:01:38.216 --> 1:01:39.304
- Yeah.
- You should... No, no.

1:01:39.304 --> 1:01:40.609
Oh, it's too big. I don't...

1:01:40.609 --> 1:01:42.046
Mmm.

1:01:43.787 --> 1:01:45.963
Yeah, it fits pretty well.

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:47.747
And now...

1:01:48.487 --> 1:01:50.619
give me some "grrrr."

1:01:50.619 --> 1:01:52.143
Be the leopard!

1:01:53.100 --> 1:01:55.146
What, uh...

1:01:56.103 --> 1:01:58.192
- No, no.

1:01:59.150 --> 1:02:00.499
- No, no, no.

1:02:00.499 --> 1:02:03.241
No fur ball.
No espresso machine.

1:02:03.241 --> 1:02:04.721
Just...

1:02:11.379 --> 1:02:12.729
This one. This one. This one.

1:02:14.426 --> 1:02:15.427
Bye.

1:02:17.603 --> 1:02:19.474
Okay. Thank you.

1:02:20.214 --> 1:02:21.694
Oh, my God.

1:02:23.348 --> 1:02:25.567
What the fuck?

1:02:28.962 --> 1:02:30.311
Are you kidding me?

1:02:44.848 --> 1:02:47.851
Oh, God.

1:02:48.677 --> 1:02:51.202
Oh, Bianca.

1:02:51.202 --> 1:02:52.420
You know, a month ago,

1:02:52.420 --> 1:02:54.771
I was feeding the homeless
in Long Beach.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:58.209
I mean, I help old people
cross the road all the time.

1:02:58.209 --> 1:03:01.212
I am a good person.

1:03:01.212 --> 1:03:04.911
Of course you are.
You made peace.

1:03:04.911 --> 1:03:08.045
Yeah, but at what cost?
I feel like Michael Corleone.

1:03:09.611 --> 1:03:10.961
You saw the movie?

1:03:10.961 --> 1:03:13.702
No. I read
the Wikipedia summary.

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:19.665
Kristin, the world isn't
black and white.

1:03:19.665 --> 1:03:22.668
Your grandfather
took care of my family.

1:03:22.668 --> 1:03:24.757
He put my mother
through school

1:03:24.757 --> 1:03:27.020
- and gave us shelter and food.
- Huh.

1:03:28.543 --> 1:03:30.807
And bought me this leg.

1:03:32.156 --> 1:03:35.115
I owe him everything.

1:03:35.115 --> 1:03:38.292
My point is, just because
you're a Mafia boss,

1:03:38.292 --> 1:03:40.860
doesn't mean you have to be
a bad person.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:43.297
Right. Right.

1:03:43.297 --> 1:03:45.691
Wait, what did you say
about your leg?

1:03:47.432 --> 1:03:50.783
When I was 13,
a truck hit my Vespa.

1:03:50.783 --> 1:03:52.567
Oh, my God!

1:03:52.567 --> 1:03:54.787
All the kids made fun of me.

1:03:54.787 --> 1:03:56.223
Oh.

1:03:56.223 --> 1:04:01.663
But Don Balbano came
to our house with a big box.

1:04:01.663 --> 1:04:04.710
And he brought me
a prosthetic leg.

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:07.582
It changed my life.

1:04:08.670 --> 1:04:11.238
Wow. I mean, jeez, I...

1:04:12.718 --> 1:04:14.720
- I didn't even...

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:16.678
Couldn't tell. Looks so real.

1:04:18.245 --> 1:04:20.421
Precision Swiss technology.

1:04:20.421 --> 1:04:23.685
- Upgraded every five years.
- Huh.

1:04:23.685 --> 1:04:25.818
So, Kristin, I'm living proof

1:04:25.818 --> 1:04:28.952
that you can do a lot of good
with the power you have.

1:04:28.952 --> 1:04:31.476
It's not about
losing yourself.

1:04:32.390 --> 1:04:35.872
It's about becoming yourself.

1:04:37.656 --> 1:04:41.790
But if this isn't
what you want, you can leave.

1:04:43.053 --> 1:04:44.141
I can?

1:04:45.316 --> 1:04:46.926
You made peace.

1:04:46.926 --> 1:04:49.537
You can go home
to your old life.

1:04:51.235 --> 1:04:52.627
To the old you.

1:04:52.627 --> 1:04:54.934
Oh, no, I don't wanna go back
to that me.

1:04:54.934 --> 1:04:56.893
I don't like that one.
No, I don't think so.

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.460
Then what do you wanna do?

1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:03.160
Well,

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:06.032
we're involved in an
import/export business, right?

1:05:06.728 --> 1:05:07.816
Mmm-hmm.

1:05:10.167 --> 1:05:11.168
Hmm.

1:05:15.128 --> 1:05:16.434
I think I have an idea.

1:05:18.871 --> 1:05:19.959
<i>It's a win-win,
right?</i>

1:05:19.959 --> 1:05:21.482
<i>Because we keep prices low</i>

1:05:21.482 --> 1:05:23.789
<i>and we sell medications
to people in Italy</i>

1:05:23.789 --> 1:05:25.965
<i>that they can't usually find
at a reasonable rate.</i>

1:05:25.965 --> 1:05:27.706
Because it's not just
about profit.

1:05:27.706 --> 1:05:29.664
It's about
helping people, right?

1:07:10.548 --> 1:07:12.332
I was just thinking.

1:07:12.332 --> 1:07:14.900
We've been together
a few months now

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:17.468
and I have never
been to your place.

1:07:17.468 --> 1:07:19.383
You're still quite secretive.

1:07:19.383 --> 1:07:22.038
I am not secretive.

1:07:23.430 --> 1:07:26.085
I'm not. Come here,
I'm gonna take a photo

1:07:26.085 --> 1:07:29.175
of us and the <i>Vaticano.</i>

1:07:29.175 --> 1:07:31.308
Right. Ready?
- Okay.

1:07:32.570 --> 1:07:34.441
- Yay.
- Yay.

1:07:34.441 --> 1:07:37.705
There. Okay.
And now I am posting it.

1:07:38.750 --> 1:07:40.839
Immediately. There.

1:07:40.839 --> 1:07:42.275
There we are. Done.

1:07:42.275 --> 1:07:43.929
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:07:49.717 --> 1:07:51.110
Nicky. Oh, my God,

1:07:51.110 --> 1:07:52.720
I miss you so much.
It's my son.

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:53.939
Who's the dude?

1:07:53.939 --> 1:07:56.724
Uh, he is my pasta teacher.

1:07:56.724 --> 1:07:59.597
We're just out
buying double zero flour.

1:07:59.597 --> 1:08:02.774
Okay. I gotta go to class.
Um, I love you.

1:08:02.774 --> 1:08:04.080
I love you.

1:08:08.258 --> 1:08:11.087
Pasta teacher?
Honestly, I just feel like

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:12.697
you're not
telling me something.

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:14.438
- Oh, really?
- Don't you trust me?

1:08:14.438 --> 1:08:17.615
- Stop it.
- Don't you trust me?

1:08:17.615 --> 1:08:19.791
Don't even joke.

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:21.967
- You can tell me anything.

1:08:26.711 --> 1:08:28.060
I love you.

1:08:38.201 --> 1:08:40.159
Oh, my God. Paul?

1:08:40.159 --> 1:08:42.074
- Your Paul?
- That Paul?

1:08:42.074 --> 1:08:43.380
Get off me! Who the hell
are these guys?

1:08:43.380 --> 1:08:44.903
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:47.340
I flew here to find you.
I saw your Insta.

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:49.864
Dammit. I post
one stupid photo.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.737
He's much weaker
than I imagined.

1:08:52.737 --> 1:08:54.695
And I imagined
someone very weak.

1:08:54.695 --> 1:08:56.654
- Who's Paul?
- I'm her husband!

1:08:56.654 --> 1:08:58.308
No...

1:08:58.308 --> 1:09:00.571
- You are married?
- No, we are separated.

1:09:00.571 --> 1:09:02.181
Look, I can see you're
a pretty handsome guy

1:09:02.181 --> 1:09:03.530
and you've been having
some great sex...

1:09:03.530 --> 1:09:04.923
Dante, please take him
back to the villa.

1:09:04.923 --> 1:09:08.405
- Come on, Paul. Let's go.
- What, what? Let me go.

1:09:08.405 --> 1:09:10.537
So he gets to go
to your place, but I can't?

1:09:10.537 --> 1:09:12.496
No, it's not like that. No.

1:09:12.496 --> 1:09:13.932
You told me you were divorced.

1:09:13.932 --> 1:09:15.194
Well, we may as well be.

1:09:15.194 --> 1:09:16.456
He's a horrible husband
who cheated on me.

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.111
- No. No.
- No, I mean...

1:09:19.111 --> 1:09:20.939
It's taken me
so long to trust again.

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:22.723
- And I really care about you.
- No, no.

1:09:22.723 --> 1:09:25.248
I... I care about you.
I care about you so much.

1:09:25.248 --> 1:09:27.163
Then let's be honest
with each other.

1:09:28.729 --> 1:09:32.516
Is there anything else
you are keeping from me?

1:09:35.258 --> 1:09:37.085
- Hmm?
- Um...

1:09:37.085 --> 1:09:39.871
Oh, my God. Um...

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:43.048
I'm so sorry, I really do
have to go deal with this.

1:09:43.048 --> 1:09:45.311
- Okay? I'm sorry.
- Sure, go.

1:09:46.312 --> 1:09:48.096
- It's okay.
- I'll see you.

1:09:56.931 --> 1:09:58.803
God dammit, Paul.
Just stay back!

1:09:58.803 --> 1:10:00.413
I need to pee, please.

1:10:00.413 --> 1:10:02.589
- What did you guys do?
- I shut his mouth.

1:10:02.589 --> 1:10:03.895
He's very annoying.

1:10:03.895 --> 1:10:05.375
I need to pee.
I can't hold it.

1:10:05.375 --> 1:10:06.941
Okay. Okay.

1:10:07.942 --> 1:10:10.554
Nice and easy.

1:10:10.554 --> 1:10:12.469
Actually, Dante, can you grab
some baby oil and Q-tips?

1:10:12.469 --> 1:10:14.166
- I think it'll be...
- Ow!

1:10:14.166 --> 1:10:16.777
Dammit! I was just
getting over a cold sore.

1:10:16.777 --> 1:10:18.953
The cheater does not
deserve your care.

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:20.955
You told these people
about Tracy?

1:10:20.955 --> 1:10:22.305
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1:10:22.305 --> 1:10:23.610
Hey. Hey.

1:10:24.785 --> 1:10:26.961
Dammit!

1:10:26.961 --> 1:10:29.660
No one talks to her that way.
Show some respect. Huh?

1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:31.314
- To Kristin?

1:10:32.489 --> 1:10:35.405
Ew. Kristin, do something.

1:10:38.321 --> 1:10:41.672
Why are you so nice

1:10:41.672 --> 1:10:43.282
- to this <i>stronzo?</i>

1:10:44.196 --> 1:10:45.328
How dare you call me something

1:10:45.328 --> 1:10:46.546
I don't even know
what it means?

1:10:47.765 --> 1:10:49.288
Who the hell are these people?

1:10:49.288 --> 1:10:51.856
They are her best
grape squashers.

1:10:51.856 --> 1:10:53.161
And I'm the label maker.

1:10:53.161 --> 1:10:55.381
Yes. I am a vintner now.

1:10:55.381 --> 1:10:58.297
- You make swords?
- Wine, <i>stronzo.</i>

1:10:58.297 --> 1:11:00.125
I'm gonna look that word up
as soon as I get outta here.

1:11:00.125 --> 1:11:02.214
Why are you even here?

1:11:02.214 --> 1:11:05.304
I hadn't heard from you.
I was worried about you.

1:11:06.349 --> 1:11:07.393
I miss you.

1:11:10.396 --> 1:11:11.484
Okay.

1:11:12.398 --> 1:11:13.486
Okay, fine.

1:11:14.182 --> 1:11:16.446
After you lost your job,

1:11:16.446 --> 1:11:18.883
our joint bank account
is empty.

1:11:18.883 --> 1:11:20.450
- So, I figured, you know,

1:11:20.450 --> 1:11:21.886
since I'm your husband,

1:11:21.886 --> 1:11:24.497
I should probably come
live with you in the villa.

1:11:24.497 --> 1:11:26.238
Oh, my God. It all makes
perfect sense now.

1:11:26.238 --> 1:11:28.588
You only came here
to get something else from me!

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:30.851
Go home, Paul.

1:11:30.851 --> 1:11:33.680
Actually, you only had enough
points for a one-way ticket.

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.334
Pathetic.
- He's not worth it.

1:11:35.334 --> 1:11:36.509
What did you see in him?

1:11:36.509 --> 1:11:37.510
- Just take my card and...
- Kristin, no.

1:11:37.510 --> 1:11:38.816
Don't!

1:11:38.816 --> 1:11:40.121
- No, you're better than this.
- You're right.

1:11:40.121 --> 1:11:41.471
- I should just book it myself.
- No, Kristin.

1:11:41.471 --> 1:11:43.386
- That's not what we meant!
- That's worse.

1:11:43.386 --> 1:11:44.735
Fine. Fine.

1:11:44.735 --> 1:11:47.781
- Paul, you're a grown-ass man!

1:11:47.781 --> 1:11:50.175
- Figure it out yourself!
- There you go.

1:11:50.175 --> 1:11:51.959
Own your power. <i>Brava.</i>

1:11:51.959 --> 1:11:54.222
- So, take him to the airport!

1:12:00.925 --> 1:12:02.361
You've been stress

1:12:02.361 --> 1:12:04.798
- grape gathering all night.

1:12:04.798 --> 1:12:08.541
Stop worrying
about your imbecile husband.

1:12:08.541 --> 1:12:11.762
He'll find his way home.
Or he won't.

1:12:11.762 --> 1:12:15.243
No, it's just that, you know,
Paul hurt me so much

1:12:15.243 --> 1:12:16.636
over the years
with all the lying.

1:12:16.636 --> 1:12:18.943
And I don't wanna do that
to Lorenzo.

1:12:18.943 --> 1:12:21.728
But you can't tell Lorenzo
about this part of your life.

1:12:21.728 --> 1:12:23.948
I know. I know.

1:12:23.948 --> 1:12:26.342
But what if it wasn't
part of my life?

1:12:28.126 --> 1:12:29.519
What are you saying?

1:12:30.476 --> 1:12:31.695
I'm saying...

1:12:32.435 --> 1:12:33.740
I want out.

1:12:35.438 --> 1:12:38.223
But the family heads
are meeting today.

1:12:38.223 --> 1:12:40.181
I'm not allowed at the table,

1:12:40.181 --> 1:12:42.532
but you and Fabrizio
have to be there.

1:12:42.532 --> 1:12:43.924
Okay, perfect.

1:12:43.924 --> 1:12:45.839
Well, that's where
I'll announce my resignation.

1:12:45.839 --> 1:12:47.798
But you can't just leave.

1:12:49.190 --> 1:12:50.409
Actually, yes, I can.

1:12:50.409 --> 1:12:52.672
You said,
once I made peace, remember?

1:12:53.891 --> 1:12:56.023
- You believed me.

1:12:56.023 --> 1:12:59.375
I knew you wouldn't go back
to your old sad life.

1:13:00.854 --> 1:13:05.642
Besides, that was before
you created all this beauty.

1:13:05.642 --> 1:13:08.775
The pharmacy business.
Helping people.

1:13:08.775 --> 1:13:12.866
I know. I just wanna
give Lorenzo a chance.

1:13:12.866 --> 1:13:15.826
So, you're willing
to give up all of this

1:13:15.826 --> 1:13:18.219
for a man you barely know?

1:13:18.219 --> 1:13:20.874
What? We've been
dating for months!

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:23.007
Have you farted
in front of him?

1:13:24.269 --> 1:13:26.445
Well, like a tiny little...

1:13:27.751 --> 1:13:29.187
He didn't hear it.
But, you know,

1:13:29.187 --> 1:13:30.754
he did fart
in front of me once.

1:13:31.624 --> 1:13:33.191
But, really,

1:13:33.191 --> 1:13:34.888
I've made up my mind.

1:13:37.021 --> 1:13:38.414
Fine.

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:41.808
I just hope
this is what you want.

1:13:41.808 --> 1:13:46.596
Never let a man dictate
who you are or what you can do.

1:14:44.523 --> 1:14:45.611
Thank you all

1:14:45.611 --> 1:14:46.830
for joining us today.

1:14:46.830 --> 1:14:48.353
We called this meeting

1:14:48.353 --> 1:14:51.356
to discuss
your pharmaceutical business.

1:14:51.835 --> 1:14:52.966
Yes.

1:14:52.966 --> 1:14:55.926
Hello, everyone.
I'm Donna Balbano.

1:14:55.926 --> 1:14:57.231
And I brought
a little something special

1:14:57.231 --> 1:14:58.319
- for everybody today.

1:15:02.149 --> 1:15:05.152
Ta-da! I made muffins.

1:15:05.152 --> 1:15:06.632
I know you may not
wanna eat them

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:07.938
because of the whole
poison thing,

1:15:07.938 --> 1:15:10.375
but please remember,
we are at peace.

1:15:11.158 --> 1:15:13.291
See? Mmm.

1:15:13.291 --> 1:15:15.249
Poison-free muffins.

1:15:15.249 --> 1:15:16.599
I just thought
it would be really nice

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:18.644
- to break bread together.
- Kristin!

1:15:18.644 --> 1:15:20.385
- My bananas were going bad...
- Enough!

1:15:20.385 --> 1:15:22.256
And I needed to use them.

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:28.001
Your business is causing
quite the problem for us.

1:15:28.001 --> 1:15:30.134
I deal with
pharmaceuticals, Mammone.

1:15:30.134 --> 1:15:32.528
I'm not touching electronics,
or your cars.

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:34.921
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1:15:34.921 --> 1:15:37.271
But all of our business

1:15:37.271 --> 1:15:39.535
has to pass by the inspectors.

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:42.581
And the inspectors
are on your payroll.

1:15:44.061 --> 1:15:46.759
Hey, listen, listen. I could
talk to the inspectors.

1:15:46.759 --> 1:15:49.414
I have a great rapport
with them.

1:15:49.414 --> 1:15:52.765
The damage is done.
We are losing a lot of money.

1:15:54.724 --> 1:15:59.598
You must pay
a percentage of your business.

1:15:59.598 --> 1:16:01.905
Actually, now is really
not the best time.

1:16:01.905 --> 1:16:04.385
I was hoping we can keep
all this beautiful peace

1:16:04.385 --> 1:16:05.691
that we've been enjoying.

1:16:05.691 --> 1:16:08.564
You know, I'm alive.
You guys are all alive.

1:16:08.564 --> 1:16:12.132
In fact, these muffins
are kind of a parting gift.

1:16:12.132 --> 1:16:14.221
I'm planning on
stepping down shortly.

1:16:15.527 --> 1:16:18.008
Oh, I'll be leaving you
in very good hands.

1:16:18.791 --> 1:16:20.663
Bianca will be taking over

1:16:20.663 --> 1:16:22.752
as the new boss
of the Balbano family.

1:16:23.970 --> 1:16:25.276
Your secretary?

1:16:25.276 --> 1:16:26.886
She is so much more than
a secretary.

1:16:26.886 --> 1:16:28.366
- You have no idea.

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:29.454
Nice joke.

1:16:31.369 --> 1:16:35.025
You think you can
fuck us all over

1:16:35.025 --> 1:16:36.548
and leave?

1:16:36.548 --> 1:16:37.636
No.

1:16:37.636 --> 1:16:38.855
It doesn't work like that.

1:16:38.855 --> 1:16:41.771
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1:16:41.771 --> 1:16:45.513
Let's all calm down.
I'm not fucking anybody over.

1:16:49.213 --> 1:16:51.868
Lorenzo?
Oh, my God, you're a cop?

1:16:51.868 --> 1:16:53.696
Not fucking us over, eh?

1:17:00.485 --> 1:17:02.269
Weapons down,
motherfuckers!

1:17:02.269 --> 1:17:03.575
Aunt Esmeralda?

1:17:14.238 --> 1:17:15.282
- Oh, my...

1:17:25.423 --> 1:17:27.294
Kristin! Kristin!

1:17:31.603 --> 1:17:33.997
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:42.440
Kristin. Kristin!

1:17:44.181 --> 1:17:45.748
- Let's go!
- Okay.

1:17:47.706 --> 1:17:48.794
Stay low.

1:18:04.288 --> 1:18:06.725
So, you were just using me
this whole entire time?

1:18:06.725 --> 1:18:08.248
My parents were gunned down

1:18:08.248 --> 1:18:10.468
by the Mafia
right in front of me!

1:18:10.468 --> 1:18:14.428
At my soccer game.
After I missed a goal.

1:18:22.654 --> 1:18:24.090
Uzi.

1:18:34.884 --> 1:18:36.276
I was assigned to this case...

1:18:36.276 --> 1:18:37.669
So I'm just a case?

1:18:37.669 --> 1:18:40.150
What about your marriage,
and your ex, that's lies?

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:41.891
Mostly.

1:18:41.891 --> 1:18:43.066
And who the fuck is Esmeralda?

1:18:43.066 --> 1:18:45.546
You mean Maria? She's my boss.

1:18:45.546 --> 1:18:47.287
And who are you?

1:18:47.287 --> 1:18:49.246
- I am Rodolfo.
- Rodolfo?

1:18:51.161 --> 1:18:52.640
Yes, but you can call me Rudy.

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:54.642
Rudy? I'm not
calling you anything.

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:03.086
Mama!

1:19:08.526 --> 1:19:11.616
Oh, my God.
Are you even a pasta maker?

1:19:11.616 --> 1:19:13.009
We were gonna
run away together.

1:19:13.009 --> 1:19:14.575
We were gonna
open a restaurant.

1:19:14.575 --> 1:19:15.968
I was gonna make the wine,
you were gonna make the food.

1:19:15.968 --> 1:19:17.578
I was gonna get fat
and you weren't gonna care.

1:19:17.578 --> 1:19:18.928
It was gonna be heaven!

1:19:19.493 --> 1:19:20.668
How fat?

1:19:22.192 --> 1:19:23.236
All clear!

1:19:24.324 --> 1:19:25.630
Get away from me.

1:19:25.630 --> 1:19:27.719
Please. No, no, Kristin,
please.  Kristin.

1:19:27.719 --> 1:19:30.026
No, I am not talking to you.
We are done.

1:19:30.026 --> 1:19:32.202
Uh, no, Kristin.

1:19:32.202 --> 1:19:33.507
I'm arresting you.

1:19:34.770 --> 1:19:35.858
I'm sorry.

1:19:44.083 --> 1:19:45.519
I'm so sorry for this.

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:50.829
Come on.

1:19:57.705 --> 1:19:59.229
I...

1:20:07.715 --> 1:20:09.848
- You...

1:20:09.848 --> 1:20:11.676
have a finger in your hair.

1:20:14.331 --> 1:20:15.593
Stick it up your ass!

1:20:21.468 --> 1:20:22.556
Ciao.

1:20:23.644 --> 1:20:24.776
<i>So...</i>

1:20:24.776 --> 1:20:26.691
This is
your first trial, right?

1:20:26.691 --> 1:20:28.780
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, good for you.

1:20:30.303 --> 1:20:32.131
Wait. Wait.

1:20:32.131 --> 1:20:33.611
- Excuse me.
Oh, my God, Jenny!

1:20:33.611 --> 1:20:35.178
- Kristin.

1:20:35.178 --> 1:20:38.094
- Don't say anything.
- Thank you so much.

1:20:38.094 --> 1:20:40.531
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness. Hey!

1:20:40.531 --> 1:20:42.707
Take your hands
off of my client!

1:20:44.013 --> 1:20:46.189
- Give me that. Give...

1:20:46.189 --> 1:20:48.017
What are you,
still in diapers?

1:20:49.148 --> 1:20:50.454
Bianca called me.

1:20:50.454 --> 1:20:52.325
You didn't think I was gonna
let my best friend

1:20:52.325 --> 1:20:54.501
rot in an Italian jail,
did you?

1:20:54.501 --> 1:20:56.895
I saw the Amanda Knox doc. No.

1:20:56.895 --> 1:20:59.376
Oh, my God.
How did they get out of jail?

1:20:59.376 --> 1:21:00.899
Not enough evidence
to charge them.

1:21:00.899 --> 1:21:03.032
Right. And what about Bianca?
Where is she?

1:21:03.032 --> 1:21:04.337
It's better for you
if she's not here.

1:21:04.337 --> 1:21:05.512
Okay, got it.

1:21:08.951 --> 1:21:10.474
- That Lorenzo?
- Yeah.

1:21:11.823 --> 1:21:12.868
Hi.

1:21:13.956 --> 1:21:14.913
Dick!

1:21:16.262 --> 1:21:19.309
Such a good echo.

1:21:19.309 --> 1:21:22.790
<i>What a dick!</i>

1:21:30.973 --> 1:21:32.670
<i>Signora Giudice,</i>

1:21:32.670 --> 1:21:36.369
today I will show that
Ms. Balbano has taken over

1:21:36.369 --> 1:21:38.894
the criminal enterprise
of her grandfather,

1:21:38.894 --> 1:21:40.243
Giuseppe Balbano.

1:21:41.070 --> 1:21:42.288
Madame Judge,

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:44.812
<i>Signora Giudice,</i>

1:21:44.812 --> 1:21:47.554
I will show you that my client
simply came to Italy

1:21:47.554 --> 1:21:48.947
to pay her respects and found

1:21:48.947 --> 1:21:51.515
that she had
inherited a vineyard.

1:21:51.515 --> 1:21:54.387
Now, was my client
seen in a room

1:21:54.387 --> 1:21:56.302
filled with
questionable people?

1:21:56.302 --> 1:21:59.479
Sure. But only to tell them
that she wanted no part of it.

1:22:01.133 --> 1:22:02.700
Giannina,

1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:05.921
could you tell us
your dealings
with the <i>Indagato.</i>

1:22:10.012 --> 1:22:13.580
Well, everyone else
calls me "waitress,"

1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:14.755
<i>cameriera,</i>

1:22:16.061 --> 1:22:17.497
but she calls me by my name.

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:22.328
She likes my bonsai tree.

1:22:22.328 --> 1:22:25.462
She tells us
we are her best vintners.

1:22:25.462 --> 1:22:27.812
She makes us feel appreciated.

1:22:27.812 --> 1:22:31.033
So, we repay our gratitude
by being her bodyguards.

1:22:31.033 --> 1:22:33.252
We go with her
at the meeting

1:22:33.252 --> 1:22:35.298
because they want to hurt

1:22:35.298 --> 1:22:36.995
- sweet woman.

1:22:36.995 --> 1:22:40.172
They are very, very,
very bad guys.

1:22:40.172 --> 1:22:43.262
Look what they did
to the poor Dante.

1:22:43.262 --> 1:22:47.049
How long was this
undercover operation of yours?

1:22:47.049 --> 1:22:50.487
Well, I've been investigating
Giuseppe Balbano for years.

1:22:50.487 --> 1:22:51.792
When I met the <i>Indagato,</i>

1:22:51.792 --> 1:22:54.447
she'd just landed in Italy
for the funeral...

1:22:54.447 --> 1:22:55.971
And when did you start having

1:22:55.971 --> 1:22:58.190
sexual relations
with my client?

1:22:58.190 --> 1:22:59.539
I ask the questions here!

1:23:00.584 --> 1:23:02.238
And when did you start

1:23:02.238 --> 1:23:04.936
having sexual relations
with the <i>Indagato?</i>

1:23:05.676 --> 1:23:07.156
About...

1:23:07.808 --> 1:23:08.853
one day after.

1:23:10.202 --> 1:23:12.378
- But she was asking for it.

1:23:12.378 --> 1:23:15.120
Okay. I mean, not...
I mean, not asking.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:18.080
But she said this trip
was her "Eat, Pray, Fuck."

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.778
The book is <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

1:23:20.778 --> 1:23:23.041
You took advantage of
an innocent winemaker

1:23:23.041 --> 1:23:25.304
and sullied
a literary masterpiece.

1:23:26.001 --> 1:23:27.393
You gross.

1:23:27.393 --> 1:23:29.830
I came to this country

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:33.051
at a time in my life

1:23:33.051 --> 1:23:36.011
where I
completely doubted myself.

1:23:36.968 --> 1:23:38.230
Then when I arrived here,

1:23:38.230 --> 1:23:41.233
I discovered that
I had inherited a vineyard.

1:23:41.233 --> 1:23:43.018
It was shriveling

1:23:43.714 --> 1:23:44.932
and dying...

1:23:47.283 --> 1:23:48.371
much like me.

1:23:49.198 --> 1:23:51.243
So, I nurtured it.

1:23:51.243 --> 1:23:52.549
And I came to realize

1:23:52.549 --> 1:23:56.074
that I inherited so much more
than a vineyard.

1:23:56.074 --> 1:24:00.426
I inherited an opportunity
to fulfil my purpose.

1:24:01.558 --> 1:24:02.602
So...

1:24:03.734 --> 1:24:05.127
I inherited me.

1:24:09.566 --> 1:24:10.567
Thank you.

1:24:14.745 --> 1:24:16.573
I don't need to hear
anything anymore.

1:24:16.573 --> 1:24:18.749
I've made my decision.

1:24:20.881 --> 1:24:22.840
No grounds to proceed.

1:24:30.935 --> 1:24:32.980
He's gonna give me
a ride home.

1:24:34.765 --> 1:24:37.289
<i>Bravo!</i>

1:24:41.163 --> 1:24:42.468
Kristin?

1:24:42.468 --> 1:24:44.470
Kristin, wait, wait,
wait, wait...

1:24:46.472 --> 1:24:48.996
Congratulations.

1:24:48.996 --> 1:24:52.739
Well, I just wanted you
to know that it wasn't all lies.

1:24:52.739 --> 1:24:54.828
I really did
fall in love with you.

1:24:56.743 --> 1:24:58.093
And I still love you.

1:25:03.663 --> 1:25:05.970
I thought I was listening
to my heart.

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:07.928
But it turns out

1:25:07.928 --> 1:25:10.496
I was just using another man
to validate me.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:14.892
And for the first time
in my life...

1:25:14.892 --> 1:25:17.112
I honestly
don't give a shit.

1:25:36.914 --> 1:25:39.786
Oh, my God. Dante. Dante.

1:25:39.786 --> 1:25:41.266
Oh, my God,
those goddamn Romanos.

1:25:42.354 --> 1:25:43.747
Oh, he's losing
a lot of blood.

1:25:43.747 --> 1:25:45.357
Here, I've got this thing.

1:25:45.357 --> 1:25:47.533
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We need to get him some help.

1:25:49.013 --> 1:25:50.057
- Oh, God, who is this?

1:25:50.057 --> 1:25:51.320
It's Bianca.
She's in the winery.

1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:53.539
Oh, my God,
she's been shot, too.

1:25:53.539 --> 1:25:58.065
Uh, uh, okay, you stay with
Dante and I'll go to Bianca.

1:25:58.065 --> 1:25:59.197
Wait, wait, wait.

1:25:59.197 --> 1:26:01.765
- Just in case.

1:26:05.247 --> 1:26:06.552
Bianca?

1:26:06.552 --> 1:26:07.858
What? Nicky.

1:26:07.858 --> 1:26:09.642
- Bianca is dead.

1:26:09.642 --> 1:26:11.122
Mom.

1:26:11.122 --> 1:26:13.385
I knew
you'd come back

1:26:13.385 --> 1:26:16.867
if your precious
Bianca texted you.

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:19.261
Drop the gun.

1:26:21.176 --> 1:26:23.221
And kick it to me.

1:26:25.528 --> 1:26:26.529
Good girl.

1:26:28.139 --> 1:26:29.401
What are you guys
doing here?

1:26:29.401 --> 1:26:30.924
You can
thank your husband for this.

1:26:30.924 --> 1:26:32.839
He lured your son here to...

1:26:32.839 --> 1:26:36.103
something about
guilting you

1:26:36.103 --> 1:26:38.062
into taking him back.

1:26:38.062 --> 1:26:39.455
Look, I was worried
about you, Mom.

1:26:39.455 --> 1:26:41.544
- Oh, honey.
Honey.

1:26:42.632 --> 1:26:43.850
What do you want?

1:26:45.156 --> 1:26:47.245
Are you serious?

1:26:47.245 --> 1:26:49.421
I want to be the head
of the Balbano family!

1:26:49.421 --> 1:26:52.424
- I told everyone I'm leaving.

1:26:52.424 --> 1:26:54.731
And leaving it all
to fucking Bianca!

1:26:56.733 --> 1:26:58.343
Hey!

1:26:58.343 --> 1:27:00.432
Really, Paul? You're just
gonna waddle out of here

1:27:00.432 --> 1:27:01.607
and leave our son
sitting there?

1:27:01.607 --> 1:27:03.174
- Whoa, whoa!

1:27:03.174 --> 1:27:05.002
No!

1:27:05.002 --> 1:27:06.699
Don't you dare touch my kid!

1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:12.488
Mom, look out.

1:27:19.146 --> 1:27:21.279
I've been shot. It burns.

1:27:21.279 --> 1:27:23.238
You have
terrible taste in men.

1:27:23.934 --> 1:27:25.109
No shit.

1:27:25.109 --> 1:27:26.589
Paul, untie our son

1:27:26.589 --> 1:27:27.981
- and get the hell outta here!
- Untie me.

1:27:27.981 --> 1:27:29.983
Babe, this knot is impossible.

1:27:29.983 --> 1:27:31.333
Hold on.

1:27:35.511 --> 1:27:37.208
- Paul. Here, take this.
- Yeah? Okay.

1:27:37.208 --> 1:27:38.470
Keep it pointed at him, okay?

1:27:38.470 --> 1:27:39.863
Yeah, it's heavy.

1:27:42.126 --> 1:27:43.867
There. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1:27:43.867 --> 1:27:45.085
Yeah. Are you?

1:27:45.085 --> 1:27:46.391
Oh, God, I'm so happy
to see you.

1:27:46.391 --> 1:27:47.523
- I've missed you so much.
- How are you?

1:27:47.523 --> 1:27:50.308
Hey, hey,
I loosened the knot, right?

1:27:50.308 --> 1:27:51.788
You're a baby.

1:27:51.788 --> 1:27:52.963
I'm not a baby, you're a baby.

1:27:52.963 --> 1:27:54.225
You're a big, fat, podgy baby.

1:27:54.225 --> 1:27:55.531
You're a big, stupid,
blonde baby.

1:27:55.531 --> 1:27:56.967
You're a baby with big poop
in your diaper.

1:27:56.967 --> 1:27:59.012
- Mom!
- Don't move!

1:27:59.012 --> 1:28:01.188
Oh, my God,
Bianca, you're alive!

1:28:01.188 --> 1:28:03.016
Of course I am.

1:28:03.016 --> 1:28:04.104
No, no, no...

1:28:04.104 --> 1:28:05.715
Fabrizio is a terrible shot.

1:28:06.759 --> 1:28:08.152
Wait, wait, wait.

1:28:09.414 --> 1:28:10.546
I saw you die.

1:28:10.546 --> 1:28:13.288
You saw me take a bullet
like a woman.

1:28:13.288 --> 1:28:15.812
But there is a fucking
major artery right there.

1:28:15.812 --> 1:28:17.379
Wrong leg, idiot.

1:28:18.902 --> 1:28:21.252
High tension steel.
- It's fucking cool, man.

1:28:23.428 --> 1:28:25.169
I did have to re-adjust it.

1:28:25.169 --> 1:28:27.171
That's why it took me
so long. Sorry.

1:28:27.171 --> 1:28:28.564
Oh, honey,
I'm just glad you're okay.

1:28:28.564 --> 1:28:29.608
<i>Grazie, amore.</i>

1:28:31.436 --> 1:28:32.742
I'm hit again.

1:28:32.742 --> 1:28:33.960
Dad, come on.

1:28:43.187 --> 1:28:44.536
Bianca,
take care of my kid, okay?

1:28:44.536 --> 1:28:46.146
Make a break for the door.

1:28:46.146 --> 1:28:48.410
I'll cover. Now!

1:28:48.410 --> 1:28:49.628
Come on, Nicky.

1:28:49.628 --> 1:28:50.716
- Come on. Come on.

1:28:50.716 --> 1:28:51.761
Go, go.

1:28:52.892 --> 1:28:54.416
- Help me, Nicky.
- Come on.

1:29:24.402 --> 1:29:25.447
Drop it.

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:33.063
You think you can just
come here and take over?

1:29:33.063 --> 1:29:35.587
This is mine! All of it!

1:29:35.587 --> 1:29:36.893
I earned it!

1:29:36.893 --> 1:29:40.113
Uh, you didn't earn anything.

1:29:40.113 --> 1:29:41.680
I'm the one
who had to come over here

1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:43.247
and clean your mess up.

1:29:43.247 --> 1:29:44.335
Oh, please.

1:29:44.335 --> 1:29:46.816
Oh, yeah.
I am the one who made this

1:29:46.816 --> 1:29:49.775
awful wine
fucking delicious.

1:29:49.775 --> 1:29:51.603
Yeah, me. This.

1:29:51.603 --> 1:29:53.736
I have done more
for this family

1:29:53.736 --> 1:29:55.215
in the last three months

1:29:55.215 --> 1:29:57.348
than you have
your entire life.

1:29:57.348 --> 1:30:00.699
And yet you feel entitled
to be the boss?

1:30:10.579 --> 1:30:12.494
Oh, my God. Uh...

1:30:12.494 --> 1:30:14.147
Oops. Are you, uh...

1:30:14.147 --> 1:30:15.671
I guess
it's a little rusty, huh?

1:30:15.671 --> 1:30:16.976
I should get this fixed.

1:30:16.976 --> 1:30:18.587
Help me!

1:30:18.587 --> 1:30:20.806
Please. Please, cousin.

1:30:38.563 --> 1:30:39.564
Say it.

1:30:40.391 --> 1:30:41.523
What?

1:30:42.219 --> 1:30:43.438
Say I'm the boss.

1:30:47.311 --> 1:30:48.834
Never!

1:30:48.834 --> 1:30:51.750
Then, as the boss,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

1:30:53.578 --> 1:30:55.014
I've always
wanted to say that.

1:30:58.409 --> 1:31:00.542
You can't do it, can you?

1:31:03.370 --> 1:31:05.808
Hey. Hey, stop! No!

1:31:06.548 --> 1:31:07.679
No!

1:31:51.593 --> 1:31:55.727
<i>Okay. Introducing
the newest Balbano rose.</i>

1:31:55.727 --> 1:31:57.990
<i>It's called Little Pinky.</i>

1:31:57.990 --> 1:31:59.688
<i>Salute.</i>
<i>Salute.</i>

1:31:59.688 --> 1:32:00.993
Whoo-hoo!

1:32:05.607 --> 1:32:07.565
That is crisp.

1:32:07.565 --> 1:32:08.740
You know, this Balbano wine's

1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:10.829
gonna get me
into some serious trouble.

1:32:11.569 --> 1:32:13.005
Blackout Jenny is coming.

1:32:13.005 --> 1:32:14.746
All right, all right, sweetie,
you should get going.

1:32:14.746 --> 1:32:16.095
Heard you got shot.

1:32:16.748 --> 1:32:18.054
Yeah, I got shot, too.

1:32:19.098 --> 1:32:22.362
- I got, like, five stitches.
- Oh.

1:32:23.625 --> 1:32:24.582
How about you?

1:32:25.801 --> 1:32:27.019
Twenty-seven stitches.

1:32:27.019 --> 1:32:29.152
And they left the bullet
in my spleen.

1:32:29.152 --> 1:32:32.198
- You wanna touch it?
- No. Put it away.

1:32:32.198 --> 1:32:33.330
Oh.

1:32:34.940 --> 1:32:37.116
- I wanna touch it.
- Mmm.

1:32:38.683 --> 1:32:40.032
Now, come. Show me around.

1:32:40.032 --> 1:32:43.514
You know, I never realized
what a badass you are.

1:32:43.514 --> 1:32:46.169
- You know, neither did I.

1:32:48.998 --> 1:32:51.783
Domenick, there's something
I need to tell you.

1:32:53.742 --> 1:32:56.396
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

1:32:56.396 --> 1:32:59.704
Are you okay?
I know it's a lot to take in.

1:32:59.704 --> 1:33:02.011
I was just held hostage...

1:33:02.011 --> 1:33:04.317
- at gunpoint.

1:33:04.317 --> 1:33:06.276
Divorce is fine. Yeah.

1:33:06.276 --> 1:33:08.365
Come here.
I hate saying goodbye to you.

1:33:08.365 --> 1:33:09.540
I'm gonna miss you.

1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:11.368
Yeah, but I'll see you
next week, Mom.

1:33:11.847 --> 1:33:13.283
Uh, yeah.

1:33:13.283 --> 1:33:15.459
- Love you.
- Actually, um...

1:33:17.592 --> 1:33:20.159
I've been
thinking about it, and...

1:33:21.639 --> 1:33:23.815
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Seriously?

1:33:23.815 --> 1:33:25.904
Yeah. Balbano Wine's
really taking off.

1:33:25.904 --> 1:33:27.819
And for the first time
in my life,

1:33:27.819 --> 1:33:29.516
I'm doing exactly
what I wanna do.

1:33:29.516 --> 1:33:31.083
Yeah, but are you sure
it's safe here?

1:33:31.083 --> 1:33:34.347
Aren't there a lot of people
who, like, wanna hurt you?

1:33:34.347 --> 1:33:36.132
No, that's not a problem
any more.

1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:39.178
Hey, Mammone.

1:33:45.576 --> 1:33:48.318
"Don't fuck with me
or you're next."

1:33:57.849 --> 1:33:58.937
Fabrizio.

1:34:04.464 --> 1:34:06.292
But you're not like,

1:34:06.292 --> 1:34:07.380
you know...

1:34:08.251 --> 1:34:09.731
in the Mafia, right?

1:34:10.862 --> 1:34:13.125
I make wine. That's all.

1:34:14.518 --> 1:34:16.041
- A vintner?
- Yeah.

1:34:16.041 --> 1:34:17.347
I wanna stay here

1:34:17.347 --> 1:34:18.870
- and be a vintner with you.
- No.

1:34:20.742 --> 1:34:22.657
- Call me.

1:34:31.230 --> 1:34:33.319
Mr. and Mrs. Martelli for you.

1:34:33.319 --> 1:34:34.973
<i>Grazie,</i> Donna Balbano.

1:34:45.549 --> 1:34:46.724
Oh, shit.

1:34:46.724 --> 1:34:49.031
Uh, Nicky. Wait, wait, wait.

1:34:51.381 --> 1:34:53.209
I made you some trail mix
for the flight.

1:34:53.209 --> 1:34:54.732
And don't forget
to put on your sweater, okay.

1:34:54.732 --> 1:34:55.820
It gets chilly
on the plane.

1:34:56.995 --> 1:34:58.780
- I love you.
- You, too.
