00:00.115 --> 00:02.917
<i>?</i>

00:02.951 --> 00:04.919
I'm not getting married
while I'm in high school.

00:04.953 --> 00:07.789
Admit it.
You're one step away from being
in the same boat I'm in.

00:07.823 --> 00:09.657
My mom's going out of town
with my dad tonight.

00:09.692 --> 00:11.426
We have my house
all to ourselves.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.594
I just wanna
make sure you get
your college applications in.

00:13.629 --> 00:15.963
Amy wants to go to college.
I'm gonna work.

00:15.998 --> 00:19.300
This is Toby,
your new study buddy.
Toby, this is Ashley.

00:19.334 --> 00:22.303
If you want what I have,
then do what I'm gonna tell you
to do. Move in with Ricky.

00:22.337 --> 00:25.273
Maybe instead of coffee,
we could have dinner
or something?

00:25.307 --> 00:27.108
Are you, like, actually
turning me down for sex?

00:27.142 --> 00:28.843
If we do it, you're gonna want
some kind of commitment.

00:28.877 --> 00:31.112
Since you offered me
your help and advice today,

00:31.146 --> 00:32.146
<i>I'd like to return the favor.</i>

00:32.180 --> 00:33.781
I'd like you to meet
my girlfriend.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.149
[laughing]

00:35.184 --> 00:37.652
This place is perfect
for the two of you.

00:37.686 --> 00:40.021
I don't think
that this is the place.

00:40.055 --> 00:41.823
I withdraw
my proposal of marriage.

00:41.857 --> 00:44.325
But I'm still open to having sex
when the time is right.

00:44.359 --> 00:46.294
So?
I liked it.

00:46.328 --> 00:47.662
I love you, Grace.

00:47.696 --> 00:48.830
I love you, too.

00:48.864 --> 00:50.665
Sorry that took so long.

00:50.733 --> 00:51.866
No problem.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.401
Now you don't
wanna get married.

00:53.435 --> 00:55.970
You wanna live together.
I just wanna be with you.

00:57.039 --> 00:58.539
So you want me
to move in here?

01:00.876 --> 01:03.044
Together. We were gonna
get through this divorce

01:03.078 --> 01:04.611
and Mom
moving out together.

01:04.646 --> 01:06.314
Do you not know
what "together" means?

01:06.348 --> 01:08.683
Would you lower your voice?
I just put John down.

01:08.717 --> 01:11.519
Why would you live with him?
He's not gonna marry you.

01:11.553 --> 01:14.055
Yeah, well, he's not gonna
marry you either,
so why do you care?

01:14.089 --> 01:16.057
Why do I care?
Why do I care?

01:16.091 --> 01:18.192
Because you're leaving
me here with Dad.

01:18.227 --> 01:21.229
At one point,
that was just what you wanted--
to live with Dad.

01:21.263 --> 01:24.332
Oh, so what?
You know, at one time,
you wanted to live with Ben.

01:24.366 --> 01:27.201
No, you wanted to marry Ben.
You did marry Ben.

01:27.236 --> 01:30.071
I went with you to the wedding.
I was a witness.
I supported you.

01:30.105 --> 01:31.572
Yes, you did,
and now I'm hoping

01:31.607 --> 01:34.008
you'll support me in this--
in me moving in with Ricky.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.877
Well, I won't.

01:35.911 --> 01:38.412
Can't you just be
an independent woman?

01:38.447 --> 01:40.248
Do you have to have
a guy all the time?

01:40.282 --> 01:42.750
Can't you live without a guy?
Yes, I can live
without a guy.

01:42.785 --> 01:44.986
But I don't want to.
That's why I'm moving in
with Ricky.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.988
No!
What do you mean,
"no," Ashley?

01:49.057 --> 01:51.492
I want Ricky and John and me
to try and be a family.

01:51.527 --> 01:53.661
You're a junior
in high school, and...

01:53.695 --> 01:55.530
No, you can't do this!

01:55.564 --> 01:57.398
You are not my mother.
Stop yelling at me.

01:58.567 --> 01:59.867
You have friends!

01:59.902 --> 02:02.069
Where's your study buddy?
Where's Toby? Call him.

02:02.104 --> 02:04.038
Or call Griffin.
Spend some time with Griffin.

02:04.072 --> 02:06.507
They didn't make me a promise
to get through this together.

02:06.542 --> 02:07.675
We're through this!

02:09.377 --> 02:10.678
I don't even know
what "this" is.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.313
Everything's going fine
if you ask me.

02:12.347 --> 02:14.182
You going somewhere?

02:14.216 --> 02:16.851
I'm not going anywhere tonight.
I'm going tomorrow.

02:16.885 --> 02:18.953
I'm moving in
with Ricky this weekend,
but you know that.

02:20.455 --> 02:22.924
What are you taking with you?
What are you packing in the box?

02:22.958 --> 02:26.227
Oh, it's mostly
just John's stuff
I'll be taking.

02:27.529 --> 02:29.530
I don't have to take
everything at once.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.901
Just gonna take a few things.
Just some clothes

02:33.936 --> 02:37.338
and, uh, maybe my pillow
and my blanket.

02:37.372 --> 02:40.341
Don't take any bed things.
Because?

02:40.375 --> 02:42.376
Because I don't like
that you're taking bed things

02:42.411 --> 02:44.879
for a bed, for a guy,
a guy you're not married to.

02:44.913 --> 02:46.380
No bed things.
Dad--

02:46.415 --> 02:48.449
Amy, you're my daughter.

02:48.483 --> 02:50.451
You're too young to be
moving out of the house,

02:50.485 --> 02:52.587
and you're way, way too young
to be moving in with a guy.

02:52.621 --> 02:54.555
It's not just me
moving in with a guy.

02:54.590 --> 02:57.625
It's my son John and me
moving in with his father
and my boyfriend.

02:57.659 --> 02:59.193
I love Ricky.
I wanna be with him.

02:59.228 --> 03:01.495
Love. You're too young
to know what love is.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.698
Maybe I am too young.
I don't know.

03:03.732 --> 03:06.167
But my situation
has made me older than my age,

03:06.201 --> 03:07.935
and I think I'm in love.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.404
I wanna do this,
and I'm doing this.
Mom said I could.

03:10.439 --> 03:13.207
Yeah, well, your mom
never should've said you could
because it's not right.

03:13.242 --> 03:15.810
It's just not right, Amy.
It's a bad, bad, bad idea.

03:15.844 --> 03:18.246
And I'll tell you
something else--
Tell me anything you want, Dad,

03:18.280 --> 03:20.715
because I am listening to you,
but you are not listening to me.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.551
What do you wanna tell me?

03:23.585 --> 03:26.053
Ricky's only doing this
because he doesn't
wanna marry you,

03:26.088 --> 03:28.589
and he feels pressure
to marry you because Ben
is marrying Adrian.

03:28.624 --> 03:31.092
Okay, one, I have feelings,

03:31.126 --> 03:32.894
d that kind of hurts
my feelings, Dad.

03:32.928 --> 03:34.762
Yeah, well, sometimes
the truth hurts, Amy.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.864
And two,
Ricky wants to do this.

03:36.899 --> 03:38.532
He said he wants
to live with me.

03:38.567 --> 03:39.901
He wants to live with you?

03:39.935 --> 03:41.369
Yes. John and me.

03:41.403 --> 03:43.571
Amy, this has no chance
of working out.

03:43.605 --> 03:46.274
You're gonna move in
and get all sexually involved
with this guy,

03:46.308 --> 03:49.510
and then he's gonna cheat on you
and break your heart, and you're
gonna come crying back here.

03:49.544 --> 03:50.945
So just save yourself
the trouble

03:50.979 --> 03:52.780
and don't move in and get
sexually involved with him.

03:52.814 --> 03:54.815
Don't do it.
Call me crazy, Dad,

03:54.850 --> 03:56.250
but I don't think Ricky's
gonna cheat on me.

03:56.285 --> 03:59.053
I think he's always wanted
somebody to love him,

03:59.087 --> 04:01.055
and I love him
and so does John.

04:01.089 --> 04:04.292
I think he's finally found
what he's always
been looking for.

04:04.326 --> 04:06.327
And I'm happy.
I'm really happy.

04:06.361 --> 04:08.095
Please, just let me
be happy, okay?

04:08.130 --> 04:10.097
You're not gonna
be happy for long.

04:10.132 --> 04:13.100
You're gonna get hurt.
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

04:13.135 --> 04:16.103
I got hurt, and I'm over it.

04:16.137 --> 04:18.673
I'm even grateful for it.

04:18.707 --> 04:21.608
Please, Dad.
Please just say it's okay.

04:21.642 --> 04:23.945
Please say you understand
why I'm doing this.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.279
Please say
you hope it works out.

04:25.314 --> 04:27.481
Say something hopeful
and encouraging, please.

04:29.952 --> 04:31.285
I can't.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.421
I can't say something
I don't mean.

04:33.455 --> 04:36.090
It's not okay, Amy.
It's just not okay.

04:36.124 --> 04:38.059
Not with me anyway.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.360

Like I told you before,
it's no problem.

05:01.787 --> 05:03.921
It's fine with me if Amy
moves in here.

05:03.956 --> 05:05.923
I thought maybe you'd
change your mind.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.425
No.

05:07.459 --> 05:09.093
Okay. Well, good to know,

05:09.128 --> 05:10.762
'cause she is moving in here.

05:10.796 --> 05:13.030
Maybe it'll give you
and Amy time to figure out

05:13.065 --> 05:15.399
if you really wanna be together
for the rest of your lives.

05:15.434 --> 05:18.870
Maybe. Maybe we do,
and maybe we don't.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.304
And if you don't,

05:20.339 --> 05:22.240
if it doesn't work out
with her living here,

05:22.274 --> 05:25.243
then keep in mind
if you part ways,

05:25.277 --> 05:27.879
then part friends,
because you're parents.

05:27.913 --> 05:30.114
That doesn't sound
exactly encouraging.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.451
Maybe I better think
about this a while longer.

05:33.485 --> 05:35.820
I'm not encouraging.
I'm not discouraging.

05:35.854 --> 05:38.623
It's your decision--
yours and Amy's.

05:38.657 --> 05:40.324
I got nothing
to do with this really.

05:40.359 --> 05:41.826
Maybe you should.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.327
This is your family's apartment,

05:43.362 --> 05:45.129
so if you don't want us
living up here,

05:45.164 --> 05:47.632
it makes you uncomfortable
in any way, just say so,

05:47.666 --> 05:49.333
and I'll just tell Amy no.

05:49.368 --> 05:50.768
Why would I be uncomfortable?

05:50.803 --> 05:52.436
This is where
your grandparents lived.

05:52.471 --> 05:54.772
I mean, what would
your grandparents think

05:54.807 --> 05:56.741
if they were alive
and they knew that Amy and I

05:56.775 --> 05:58.442
are living together here
and not married?

05:59.611 --> 06:01.579
They were very tolerant--
my grandparents.

06:01.613 --> 06:03.581
My parents, too,
for that matter.

06:03.615 --> 06:05.449
They didn't really
judge other people.

06:06.552 --> 06:07.652
Oh.

06:07.686 --> 06:09.287
What do your parents think?

06:09.321 --> 06:11.422
They're okay with it.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.925
And my mom, Nora,
loves the idea.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.460
She loves Amy and John.

06:16.495 --> 06:18.095
And do you love Amy?

06:18.130 --> 06:19.764
I...

06:19.798 --> 06:21.165
Yeah.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.801
I guess I kind of love Amy.

06:23.836 --> 06:25.670
You guess.

06:25.704 --> 06:27.672
I've never said that to her.

06:27.706 --> 06:29.240
I don't wanna say that to her.

06:29.274 --> 06:31.309
I don't think I'm ready
to say that to her.

06:31.343 --> 06:33.644
But you're ready for her
to move in here?

06:34.980 --> 06:37.415
Are you just doing this
because you don't wanna

06:37.449 --> 06:39.083
get married to her?

06:39.117 --> 06:40.184
Yes.

06:40.219 --> 06:41.485
Oh, boy.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.154
No. I mean,

06:43.188 --> 06:45.022
I don't not want
to marry her.

06:47.392 --> 06:50.628
If I had to get married
to someone right now,

06:50.662 --> 06:53.064
today,
it would definitely be Amy.

06:53.098 --> 06:55.433
But I don't feel I have to
get married to Amy right now.

06:55.467 --> 06:58.135
And I can't.
I just can't.

06:58.170 --> 07:00.671
You don't have to
live with her either
unless you want to.

07:00.706 --> 07:03.307
Yeah, I do.
Unless you say no,

07:03.342 --> 07:05.710
I really don't have any reason
that she can't live here.

07:05.744 --> 07:08.646
Well, you don't need me
to give you a reason.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.581
It's reason enough
if you're just not ready

07:10.616 --> 07:12.884
to take that step--
moving in together.

07:12.918 --> 07:14.418
That's not a reason.

07:14.453 --> 07:16.354
Yeah, it is.

07:16.388 --> 07:18.856
Maybe you're not ready
because, uh,

07:18.891 --> 07:21.893
there's some other things
you wanna do before you make
a commitment like this.

07:21.927 --> 07:23.227
Like?

07:24.263 --> 07:26.230
Maybe...

07:26.265 --> 07:28.366
Maybe you wanna
go to college.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.768
I'm not going to college.

07:30.802 --> 07:32.870
I told the counselor
I'm not going to college.

07:32.905 --> 07:34.272
Oh.

07:35.307 --> 07:37.074
Wait. Did she call you
or something?

07:37.109 --> 07:38.910
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

07:40.746 --> 07:43.080
Uh, she thought maybe
I could talk to you.

07:43.115 --> 07:45.549
As your boss.
You know, as a businessman.

07:45.584 --> 07:47.618
But you didn't go to college.

07:47.653 --> 07:50.087
That's why I was hesitant
to even bring it up.

07:50.122 --> 07:51.589
I didn't go to college,

07:51.623 --> 07:53.724
but I've surrounded myself
with people who went to college.

07:53.759 --> 07:56.027
Bunny went to college.

07:56.061 --> 07:58.095
She has a business degree,
and it's helped her a lot

07:58.130 --> 07:59.764
with managing the butcher shop.

07:59.798 --> 08:02.967
And if I'm not ready
to move in with Amy,

08:03.001 --> 08:04.635
college would be
a good excuse.

08:04.670 --> 08:07.204
No. Not necessarily.

08:07.239 --> 08:10.508
But if you wanna go to college,
if you wanna think about it,

08:10.542 --> 08:12.510
whether Amy's
living here or not,

08:12.544 --> 08:14.745
then now is the time
to do something about it.

08:16.615 --> 08:18.582
The company gives away
scholarship money every year,

08:18.617 --> 08:20.751
and I'd love to see
some of that come to you.

08:20.786 --> 08:23.387
All right.
I'll think about it.

08:23.422 --> 08:25.423
Right now, I'm thinking
it's too late.

08:26.758 --> 08:29.593
It's not too late to get in.
You've still got time.

08:29.628 --> 08:33.331
No. I mean, it's too late
to use college as an excuse

08:33.365 --> 08:35.366
to say no to Amy.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.601
I really wish you talked to me
about this sooner.

08:38.870 --> 08:42.006
Well, you're not really
going into this move

08:42.039 --> 08:44.008
with the best attitude.

08:44.042 --> 08:46.510
But I wish you luck.

08:46.545 --> 08:48.446
I hope it works out.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.681
Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Boykewich.

08:51.950 --> 08:53.851
You know,
I think it's about time

08:53.885 --> 08:56.620
you started
calling me Leo, huh?

08:56.655 --> 08:58.789
I feel like I've got
two sons sometimes,

08:58.824 --> 09:00.992
you
and both o
are in over your head.

09:04.296 --> 09:05.730
[door closes]

09:05.764 --> 09:08.099
You can say that again.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.867
We're not moving in
until after the wedding,

09:09.901 --> 09:11.369
but we wanna have
everything set up.

09:11.403 --> 09:12.903
You know, the baby
could come early.

09:12.938 --> 09:14.839
Lots of first babies
come early.

09:14.873 --> 09:16.140
Or-- Or late.

09:16.174 --> 09:17.975
Uh, so if we had to do that--

09:18.010 --> 09:20.277
You know, if the baby
does come early,
like before the wedding,

09:20.312 --> 09:22.480
we wanna have everything
ready for her.

09:22.514 --> 09:24.348
Interesting.

09:24.383 --> 09:26.283
Yeah, so we thought
that maybe you two

09:26.318 --> 09:28.986
could come with us tonight
and help us pick out
baby furniture,

09:29.021 --> 09:31.288
and then maybe we'll all go
grab a pizza or something.

09:31.323 --> 09:34.658
Why don't we meet you after
you pick out the nursery stuff?

09:34.693 --> 09:36.594
Yeah, we don't know anything
about nursery stuff.

09:36.628 --> 09:39.196
And we don't really want to.
No, we don't really want to.

09:39.231 --> 09:41.332
Look, someday you'll
be getting married,

09:41.366 --> 09:43.501
and you'll be buying stuff
for your baby,

09:43.535 --> 09:45.669
and it'll be
a learning experience
for you both.

09:45.704 --> 09:49.006
I mean, it's even gonna be
a learning experience
for Adrian and me.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.875
We'd love to have your help.
It'll be fun.

09:50.909 --> 09:52.977
How can we help you
if we don't know
anything about it?

09:53.011 --> 09:54.678
Yeah, and how can it be fun?
I mean, for us.

09:54.713 --> 09:57.181
It might be fun
for you and Adrian,
but it would not be fun for us.

09:57.215 --> 10:00.584
We'll meet you afterward.
Come on.
You guys are my best friends.

10:02.521 --> 10:05.056
It's really so sweet of you
to feel that way, Ben.

10:05.090 --> 10:07.058
But you have
a new best friend.
Adrian.

10:07.092 --> 10:10.261
Come on. You two will
always be my best friends.

10:10.295 --> 10:11.629
Adrian is just--

10:11.663 --> 10:13.864
The mother of your baby
and your soon-to-be wife?

10:13.899 --> 10:16.834
Yeah. But, guys,

10:16.868 --> 10:19.336
that's not gonna change anything
between the three of us.

10:19.371 --> 10:20.604
Yeah, it probably will.

10:20.639 --> 10:23.040
It already has.
That's the way life is.

10:23.075 --> 10:26.243
Things change.
Things are changing, fast.

10:26.278 --> 10:29.713
We can't be a part of everything
in your life anymore, Ben.

10:29.748 --> 10:32.083
But you can be
a part of this.

10:32.117 --> 10:34.051
Do you have something
better to do tonight?

10:34.086 --> 10:35.786
Actually, yes, we do.

10:35.821 --> 10:36.887
What?

10:36.922 --> 10:38.722
You know what.

10:38.757 --> 10:40.724
Okay, I know what,

10:40.759 --> 10:42.893
but you guys can do that
whenever you want.

10:42.928 --> 10:45.296
No, we can't.
Alice's parents
are going out to dinner.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.565
When they get home from dinner,
we'll meet you for pizza.

10:47.599 --> 10:48.933
Come on.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.634
This is gonna be
one of those things

10:50.669 --> 10:53.070
that we tell our daughter about
when she's older, you know?

10:53.105 --> 10:54.371
"You see that crib?

10:54.406 --> 10:56.407
Henry and Alice helped us
pick that out for you."

10:58.276 --> 11:01.112
Look, we feel badly
that you're getting married

11:01.146 --> 11:03.881
and you're having a baby
and you're moving into a condo

11:03.915 --> 11:07.518
and you're buying baby furniture
and you're not having sex.

11:07.552 --> 11:08.619
But we are.

11:08.653 --> 11:11.155
I don't mind not having sex.

11:11.189 --> 11:14.725
Adrian and I have our entire
lifetimes to have sex, okay?

11:14.759 --> 11:16.227
And you do, too.

11:16.261 --> 11:18.929
I'm happy not having sex
with my soon-to-be wife

11:18.964 --> 11:20.598
who's having our baby.

11:20.632 --> 11:22.266
I mean, it's all good--

11:22.300 --> 11:24.702
the move,
the wedding, the baby.

11:24.736 --> 11:27.304
Even the picking out
of the baby furniture.

11:27.339 --> 11:29.440
I'm ready for it all.
Bring it on.

11:29.474 --> 11:30.708
[together]
Really?

11:30.742 --> 11:33.077
Yeah. Absolutely.

11:33.111 --> 11:35.980
Come on.
You know, we'll go
to the baby furniture store.

11:36.014 --> 11:39.216
We'll grab a pizza,
and then I'll drop Adrian off,

11:39.251 --> 11:41.218
and we'll all come over here,
and you guys
can spend the night,

11:41.253 --> 11:43.020
and it'll be like nothing
every happened.

11:43.054 --> 11:44.588
For the next four weeks,

11:44.623 --> 11:46.123
it'll be like
nothing ever happened.

11:46.158 --> 11:48.959
Are you sure you're going
to go through with all of this?

11:48.994 --> 11:50.828
Pretty sure.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:59.168 --> 12:00.301
Morning.

12:00.336 --> 12:02.103
Morning, Adrian.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.772
I'm happy
you're still here.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.407
I wanted to say good-bye,
but your dad and I
stayed up talking,

12:06.442 --> 12:10.578
and I got to sleep late
and then I got up late.

12:10.613 --> 12:13.148
I'm gonna be away for most
of the next four weeks,
you know.

12:13.182 --> 12:15.984
Yeah, I know.
But then I'll be off
for almost four weeks.

12:16.018 --> 12:19.554
So I can help with the move
and the wedding
and when the baby comes.

12:19.588 --> 12:22.157
Aw, thanks, Mom.
I really appreciate that,

12:22.191 --> 12:24.025
but I think everything's
under control.

12:25.027 --> 12:26.361
Oh. All right.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.363
Well, if you say so.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.865
Sounds like a lot
of life-changing events to me,

12:30.900 --> 12:34.102
but if you have
everything under control...

12:36.071 --> 12:38.072
What are you
gonna be getting married in?

12:38.107 --> 12:41.075
What are you gonna be wearing?
I don't want you
to end up like I did.

12:41.110 --> 12:44.078
Uh, I don't know.
I was just gonna look
for something bridal.

12:44.113 --> 12:45.713
In a maternity store?

12:45.748 --> 12:48.249
Well, I can't be the first girl
who ever got married pregnant.

12:48.284 --> 12:50.185
I'm sure there's something
out there for me.
Don't worry.

12:50.219 --> 12:53.354
Hmm. Photographer?
Are you gonna have
a photographer at the wedding?

12:53.389 --> 12:56.057
Oh, I should
get a photographer.

12:56.091 --> 12:58.393
Yeah. Yeah,
I think you should.

12:58.427 --> 13:01.596
Did you order the flowers?
Uh...

13:01.630 --> 13:04.499
Look, I've got four weeks,
and you're making this
awfully complicated.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.034
It's just a tiny little wedding.

13:06.068 --> 13:07.869
It's your wedding,

13:07.903 --> 13:09.437
and you're gonna want
a wedding dress

13:09.471 --> 13:11.406
and a wedding cake
and a wedding photographer,

13:11.440 --> 13:12.740
I'm pretty sure.

13:12.775 --> 13:16.311
Have you and Ben talked
seriously about finances?

13:16.345 --> 13:19.480
Have you talked about
how you're gonna deal
with financial matters?

13:19.515 --> 13:22.250
Are you two going to open up
a joint checking account,

13:22.284 --> 13:24.419
or are you gonna keep
your money separately?

13:24.453 --> 13:25.954
Is there a prenup?

13:27.089 --> 13:28.590
You think he wants a prenup?

13:28.624 --> 13:31.726
I would think he does.
Yeah.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.895
Uh, okay, look.

13:33.929 --> 13:36.598
You just go on off to work.
You're starting
to stress me out.

13:36.632 --> 13:41.035
Okay. I don't wanna
stress you out, but...

13:41.070 --> 13:43.404
Are you sure you don't
wanna change your mind?

13:43.439 --> 13:45.106
It's not too late,
you know.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.075
You can even wait
until the baby is older.

13:47.109 --> 13:49.477
Like when the baby is 16?

13:50.946 --> 13:52.413
Look, I haven't
changed my mind,

13:52.448 --> 13:54.115
and I'm not going
to change my mind.

13:54.149 --> 13:55.783
Okay. But if you do--

13:55.818 --> 13:57.418
I won't.

13:57.453 --> 13:59.988
You know where to reach me.

14:00.022 --> 14:02.056
Call me if you need me.
Okay.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.425
I love you.
I love you, too.

14:12.334 --> 14:14.469
[door opens, closes]

14:14.503 --> 14:16.137
[sighs]

14:16.171 --> 14:18.606
I hope we know
what we're doing.

14:24.346 --> 14:26.648
Don't help me or anything.

14:26.682 --> 14:28.449
I'll help you.
I'll give you some advice.

14:28.484 --> 14:31.319
Don't move into
Ricky's apartment.

14:31.353 --> 14:33.154
It's too soon,
and you're not ready.

14:33.188 --> 14:34.923
No, you're not ready.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.792
But you'll never be ready,
so just try not to hate me
for moving.

14:37.826 --> 14:40.361
Fine. Don't listen to me.
But you're gonna be sorry.

14:40.396 --> 14:42.130
No, I'm not gonna be sorry.

14:42.164 --> 14:44.365
Fine.
Then just move out.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.334
I am. Tonight.

14:52.708 --> 14:54.342
[sighs]

14:58.414 --> 15:00.848
There must be some way
to stop her from doing this.

15:02.051 --> 15:05.053
Yeah. I've been thinking
about that.

15:05.087 --> 15:07.522
Maybe ere is.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.557
Well, like you always say,

15:09.591 --> 15:12.860
the world is divided into things
that you can do something about

15:12.895 --> 15:15.029
and things you can't
do anything about.

15:15.064 --> 15:17.966
Well, if this is something
I can do something about,
then I'll do it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.500
But I don't know
what that is.

15:19.535 --> 15:21.336
Is there something
you can do about it?

15:21.370 --> 15:24.505
Maybe. I'll have to think
about it some more.

15:27.309 --> 15:28.876
[car door closes]

15:30.379 --> 15:32.180
[engine starts]

15:45.361 --> 15:46.627
Hi.

15:46.662 --> 15:47.862
Hi, Adrian.

15:47.896 --> 15:50.798
So I guess you heard
Ben and I got a condo.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.501
Yeah, I heard.
I'm really happy
that worked out.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.837
Yeah. So we're just
gonna have a small wedding.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.338
A nice small wedding.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.906
It's much nicer
than having people there

15:58.941 --> 16:00.508
who aren't really happy
we're getting married.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.010
Hey, if you're
talking about me,

16:02.044 --> 16:03.511
I'm happy
you're getting married.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.380
I'm really happy
you're getting married.

16:05.414 --> 16:06.881
If you weren't
getting married,

16:06.915 --> 16:08.983
I probably wouldn't be
moving in with Ricky.

16:09.018 --> 16:11.319
That was some good advice
you gave me. Thanks.

16:11.353 --> 16:13.521
I gave you some
pretty good advice, too.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.590
Yeah. Thanks.

16:15.624 --> 16:17.692
So it's-- it's definite.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.028
You're moving in with Ricky.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.863
Yeah, it's definite.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.499
I'm moving in tonight.

16:24.533 --> 16:26.034
When are you and Ben
moving into the condo?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.703
After the wedding.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.706
Our parents really want us
to be married first, so...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.041
So...

16:33.075 --> 16:35.543
And how's Ricky doing?

16:35.577 --> 16:37.078
Oh, he's fine.

16:37.112 --> 16:40.048
He seems kind of,
uh, excited.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.051
Oh, yeah,
I bet he is excited.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.719
I mean,
if you two live together,

16:44.753 --> 16:47.088
I assume he'll cave
on the issue of sex.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.057
I mean, he'll have to
have sex with you.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.192
I thought
you knew about that.

16:51.226 --> 16:54.228
Yeah, I think that's safe
to assume that he'll wanna
have sex with me.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.164
Mmm. It's scary, huh?

16:56.198 --> 16:57.331
Scary?

16:57.366 --> 17:00.435
Well, I mean,
after waiting all this time

17:00.469 --> 17:03.571
the expectations
must really be building
for you and for him.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.573
As they are for you and Ben.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.907
Well, yeah.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.243
But, of course,
I've had sex more than once,

17:10.279 --> 17:11.878
and I really like sex,

17:11.914 --> 17:14.082
and I'm very comfortable
being in a sexual relationship.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.782
So is Ricky,
I imagine.

17:15.818 --> 17:18.586
Oh, yeah.
Take it from me.

17:18.619 --> 17:21.155
He is.
But, I mean,

17:21.190 --> 17:23.156
I'm sure once you two
spend a few months

17:23.192 --> 17:25.760
or even a year or two together
like we did,

17:25.794 --> 17:28.596
things will be great
between you two, sexually.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.098
Mmm. I'm sure.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.066
I'm sure the same is true
for you and Ben.

17:32.101 --> 17:34.735
Oh, of course.
I mean, I can tell
just from that one time.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.370
Yeah,

17:36.405 --> 17:39.207
but at least Ricky and I
won't be dealing with a newborn.

17:39.241 --> 17:41.809
They're a lot of work.
A lot of work.

17:41.844 --> 17:45.113
You're gonna be really tired
for a long, long time.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.683
And with everything
you have going on--

17:48.717 --> 17:51.252
the wedding,
the moving in,

17:51.286 --> 17:52.753
having a baby,

17:52.788 --> 17:54.989
trying to get used
to Ben sexually...

17:55.023 --> 17:57.425
I don't know how
you're gonna do it.
I'll do it.

17:57.459 --> 17:59.594
You'll have to.
You'll be a wife and a mother.

18:01.029 --> 18:04.298
I wonder if sex will change
for you after you have the baby.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.634
I mean, your hormones
just go crazy.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.604
Oh, and then
there's breastfeeding.
You are gonna breastfeed, right?

18:09.638 --> 18:10.972
Yeah. Think so.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.807
Mmm.

18:12.841 --> 18:17.311
It's just so wonderful
and weird all at the same time.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.148
And just a little painful
starting out, as I remember.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.050
Of course, not as painful
as childbirth,

18:23.085 --> 18:25.153
but it doesn't take long
to forget that.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.689
Of course, I wasn't trying
to have sex with a new husband
while I was trying to forget.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.424
Okay. Okay.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.426
You know more
about all the babies.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.328
But I know way more
about sex.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.331
Why is it that no matter
what steps we take
to try and be friends,

18:37.366 --> 18:39.300
we always end up
in some stupid competition?

18:39.334 --> 18:41.969
I don't know.
Maybe because it is
a competition.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.005
But, hey, you know,
we're both winners here.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.507
You're moving in with Ricky
over the butcher shop,

18:46.542 --> 18:48.576
and I'm getting married to Ben,

18:48.610 --> 18:50.711
whose family owns
the butcher shop.

18:50.746 --> 18:52.914
So what you're saying
is you win.

18:52.948 --> 18:54.882
We'll just have to see,
won't we?

18:54.917 --> 18:56.217
What do you mean by that?

18:56.251 --> 18:58.986
I mean, that either one of them
can still back out.

18:59.021 --> 19:00.321
Ben or Ricky.

19:00.355 --> 19:01.822
And not getting married
is bigger

19:01.857 --> 19:03.558
and much worse
than not moving in.

19:03.592 --> 19:05.526
So you can still lose.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.662
Ben would never back out.

19:07.696 --> 19:11.199
Now, Ricky might back out,
but not Ben.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.000
You never know.

19:13.035 --> 19:15.670
No. You never know.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.375
Do you? Do you ever think
about backing out?

19:21.410 --> 19:23.678
Do you?

19:25.347 --> 19:28.015
I have no reason to back out.

19:28.050 --> 19:29.817
Neither do I.

19:33.057 --> 19:34.891
I'm not telling you anything.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.826
Because one,
it's my personal business

19:36.861 --> 19:38.828
and not something
I wanna discuss with anyone,

19:38.863 --> 19:40.330
not even my own brother.

19:40.364 --> 19:42.899
And two,
you need to get back out there
and get a girlfriend,

19:42.933 --> 19:45.602
because you should be more
interested in your love life
than my love life.

19:45.636 --> 19:47.537
Good advice.

19:47.571 --> 19:51.908
Now, tell me where
I can go and get a girlfriend.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.144
I can't date the women
I work with.

19:54.178 --> 19:57.781
Well, maybe instead of always
asking me and Jack
to drop you off at work,

19:57.815 --> 19:59.082
maybe you can take the bus.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.483
Maybe you would meet
somebody on the bus.

20:00.518 --> 20:04.120
I want someone who has a car.

20:04.155 --> 20:07.657
I want someone
who can drive me around.

20:07.692 --> 20:10.927
Well, you can keep dreaming
about finding a girl
who's gonna drive you around,

20:10.961 --> 20:13.930
or you can take the bus
and meet the girl
of your dreams.

20:13.964 --> 20:17.434
All right. I'm desperate.

20:17.468 --> 20:21.071
I try it just
for a week or two.

20:21.105 --> 20:23.773
And you and Jack
are not off the hook.

20:23.808 --> 20:26.009
Well, good. That's good.
Good for you for trying.

20:26.043 --> 20:27.310
Yeah, yeah.
[taps counter]

20:31.148 --> 20:32.882
[door closes]

20:34.885 --> 20:37.454
Good morning, honey.
Morning.

20:37.488 --> 20:38.855
How are you?

20:38.889 --> 20:41.024
I'm not good.

20:41.058 --> 20:43.993
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

20:44.028 --> 20:46.429
There's no way the same thing's
gonna happen to Jeff

20:46.464 --> 20:49.199
that happened to his brother
and your husband and my dad.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.867
There's no way.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.535
He'll be fine.

20:52.570 --> 20:55.004
And he's flying commercial.
He's not flying his own plane.

20:55.039 --> 20:57.874
And God just wouldn't
do that a second time.

20:57.908 --> 21:01.044
Yeah, well, it's not God
flying the commercial plane,
honey.

21:01.078 --> 21:04.514
It's a human being,
and human beings make mistakes.

21:05.549 --> 21:07.684
I just can't help
but worry about him.

21:08.753 --> 21:10.720
I mean, even if
the plane doesn't crash,

21:10.755 --> 21:14.324
he's still got four weeks
in a remote village in Africa.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.359
Something could happen
to him.

21:16.393 --> 21:17.861
But he's a doctor,

21:17.895 --> 21:20.363
and he's the type of doctor
who likes to help people.

21:20.397 --> 21:23.366
You knew that
when you married him.
Yeah, I did.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.536
Well, maybe this is
a good opportunity
for you to get back out there.

21:26.570 --> 21:29.539
Yeah, maybe.
But then I'd be out of the house
a lot when Grant's here,

21:29.573 --> 21:32.408
and I hate the idea
of the two of you
having sex in your room.

21:32.443 --> 21:35.211
That's what's keeping you
from having a life?

21:35.246 --> 21:37.046
Just so you know, Grace,

21:37.081 --> 21:39.482
the first time may be fun,

21:39.517 --> 21:42.552
but the second time
may be no fun at all.

21:43.721 --> 21:45.588
Whatever. All I'm saying

21:45.623 --> 21:47.891
is that it's not sex
that'll keep a guy around.

21:47.925 --> 21:49.559
It's a commitment

21:49.593 --> 21:51.227
and a desire
to be with each other

21:51.262 --> 21:53.029
and have a life together.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.431
I know.
You told me before.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.135
Anyway, my second time

21:59.170 --> 22:01.604
was definitely
as good as my first time.

22:03.774 --> 22:05.375
Maybe even better.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.378
Well, then, the third time
may not be as fun.

22:08.412 --> 22:09.746
Go to school.

22:15.586 --> 22:16.886
Mom, he'll be fine.

22:20.324 --> 22:22.425
Can Grant sleep over?

22:23.460 --> 22:24.861
[scoffs]

22:24.895 --> 22:27.263
Grace, tonight?

22:27.298 --> 22:29.899
Well, it's just we spent
last weekend at his house, so...

22:29.934 --> 22:32.302
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
It's fine.

22:32.336 --> 22:33.970
Thank you. Thank you.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.439
And I'll let you know
about the third time
and the fourth time

22:36.473 --> 22:40.210
and the fifth time
and the thousandth time.

22:40.244 --> 22:42.245
[door closes]

22:44.114 --> 22:46.583
[Girl]
Wait up!

22:46.617 --> 22:49.519
I just-- I don't know
if Ricky is really happy
about this.

22:49.553 --> 22:52.589
I mean, he's letting me
move in, but is that
what he really wants?

22:52.623 --> 22:54.591
Who cares? Is this
what you really want?

22:54.625 --> 22:56.526
This is what
you really wanted.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.062
When did you change your mind?
Yeah, when did you
change your mind?

22:59.096 --> 23:01.297
I didn't.
I'm just saying
maybe I should.

23:01.332 --> 23:03.099
Okay, what's going on
with you?

23:03.133 --> 23:05.401
I lost my confidence,
that's all.

23:05.436 --> 23:07.971
How'd you do that?
I don't know.

23:08.005 --> 23:09.539
Maybe I'm over-thinking things,

23:09.573 --> 23:11.941
but what if we're not
sexually compatible?

23:11.976 --> 23:14.444
What if I move in,
and we don't click?

23:14.478 --> 23:16.913
You'll click.
Yeah, I'm sure
you'll click.

23:16.947 --> 23:19.449
You never know.

23:19.483 --> 23:21.484
What if I'm not as good
as Adrian was?

23:21.518 --> 23:23.620
That's ridiculous?
Is it?

23:23.654 --> 23:25.288
Uh, yeah. I mean,

23:25.322 --> 23:27.223
who can compete
with Adrian sexually?

23:27.258 --> 23:29.492
Don't even try.
Just be comfortable

23:29.526 --> 23:31.294
with who you are
and what you have to offer.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.229
Yeah, well, Madison,
aren't you just a little worried

23:33.264 --> 23:34.998
that you won't live up
to Jack's expectations?

23:35.032 --> 23:37.133
Uh, come on.
[chuckling]
No.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.801
The whole school knows
that Grace thought it was

23:38.836 --> 23:40.436
the greatest
sexual encounter ever.

23:40.471 --> 23:42.939
Well, no, it wasn't.
Not for Jack.

23:42.973 --> 23:44.974
And, you know,
Grace couldn't have been

23:45.009 --> 23:47.543
nearly as comfortable
with Jack then as I am now.

23:47.578 --> 23:49.312
Yeah, well,
they're both religious.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.848
And I heard
that religious people

23:51.882 --> 23:54.651
get all filled
with the Spirit
and have crazy sex.

23:54.685 --> 23:56.786
[chuckles]
Well, then, I'll convert.

23:56.820 --> 24:00.023
And don't forget,
your new friend Frank
has quite the reputation, too.

24:00.057 --> 24:01.691
Doesn't matter to me.

24:01.725 --> 24:04.160
I have no intentions
of doing anything with him

24:04.194 --> 24:06.462
or any other guy
in high school.

24:06.497 --> 24:09.632
I don't wanna get involved
with any competitions
regarding sex.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.467
I don't care
what everyone else does.

24:11.502 --> 24:13.836
Yeah, well, you've been
dating him for about a week.

24:13.871 --> 24:17.340
Amy, you cannot let
your insecurities about sex
get the best of you.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.877
You know, there's no such thing
as being good in bed
or bad in bed.

24:20.911 --> 24:23.179
If two people
really love each other,
and it's the right time,

24:23.213 --> 24:24.681
then it's the right time.

24:24.715 --> 24:27.183
Oh, jeez. Is that
what Jack told you?

24:27.217 --> 24:29.986
I think you should wait.

24:30.020 --> 24:32.021
You wait.
I'm going to.

24:32.056 --> 24:34.691
The more I hear,
the longer I'm waiting.

24:37.561 --> 24:38.895
[sighs]

24:38.929 --> 24:41.731
My sister really doesn't
want me to move in with him.

24:41.765 --> 24:44.067
She says I promised her
I'd get her through

24:44.101 --> 24:46.703
Mom and Dad splitting up,
that we'd get
each other through.

24:46.737 --> 24:49.739
Yeah, well, of course Ashley
doesn't want you
to move in with Ricky,

24:49.773 --> 24:52.275
and it has nothing to do with
your mom and dad splitting up.

24:52.309 --> 24:54.210
Yeah, and after what
she did with Ricky,

24:54.244 --> 24:56.913
or what she tried to do,
her opinion doesn't count.

24:56.947 --> 24:58.848
I don't know.
She's still my sister.

24:58.882 --> 25:00.216
- Are you trying to think
- [door opens]

25:00.250 --> 25:02.251
of an excuse to get out
of moving in with Ricky?

25:02.286 --> 25:04.954
Oh, scoot.
I have to talk to Jack.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.625
Your friends don't like me?
Oh, no. They like you.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.561
I just have to talk to you.
Oh, not today.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.429
Why do you always wait
till game day to talk to me?

25:13.464 --> 25:15.531
I wanna go to church.

25:15.566 --> 25:17.400
Oh, okay.
I'll take you to church.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.869
I wanna go before
we do anything more
than what we were doing.

25:19.903 --> 25:21.604
All right.
All right?

25:21.638 --> 25:23.239
Yeah. Is there
some reason why or--

25:23.273 --> 25:25.675
I just heard that people who
are filled with the Holy Spirit

25:25.709 --> 25:27.276
have better sex.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.345
Keep in mind
that's probably coming
from the same people

25:29.380 --> 25:31.447
that say you should wait
to have sex
until you're married.

25:31.482 --> 25:33.449
Okay, well, then,
I guess that won't work.

25:33.484 --> 25:35.084
Never mind.
Well, why won't it work?

25:35.119 --> 25:37.020
I don't want the sex
that you had with Grace

25:37.054 --> 25:38.955
to be better than the sex
you have with me.

25:38.989 --> 25:41.724
Who cares about that?
So you're saying you don't think
it'd be as good.

25:41.759 --> 25:43.893
No. Madison, I've forgotten
all about that.

25:43.927 --> 25:45.094
Oh, I doubt it!

25:45.129 --> 25:47.463
I think all consensual sex
is good

25:47.498 --> 25:50.099
between two people
that are old enough
to make that decision.

25:50.134 --> 25:52.502
Although, some sex
is better than other sex.

25:52.536 --> 25:54.771
And what makes it better
is how they feel
about each other.

25:54.805 --> 25:57.774
How you feel about me
and how I feel about you.

25:57.808 --> 26:00.943
And I think you're gonna
feel better about me if I stop
putting the pressure on you.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.279
Oh, my God,
my dad got to you.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.781
Actually, it was Emily,
your stepmom.

26:04.815 --> 26:05.915
Really?
Yeah.

26:05.949 --> 26:08.117
Well, I'm sure my dad
put her up to it.

26:08.152 --> 26:09.986
And you're not pressuring me
into anything.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.988
Just the same,
I said we'd take our time.

26:12.022 --> 26:13.756
Well, it's not just
your decision.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.291
I know that.

26:15.325 --> 26:16.759
I wanna do it.

26:16.794 --> 26:18.995
When I'm ready.

26:19.029 --> 26:21.597
Hey, look who's here.

26:21.632 --> 26:23.633
Yeah. And I'll be back
next week

26:23.667 --> 26:26.402
and the next and the next.

26:26.437 --> 26:28.805
How are you?
I've missed you.

26:28.839 --> 26:29.972
Have you?

26:30.007 --> 26:32.475
Yes, I have.
How's Peter?

26:32.509 --> 26:33.476
He's great.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.678
And, uh,
how's his friend...

26:35.712 --> 26:37.613
Uh, what's her name?

26:37.648 --> 26:39.115
You mean Hayley?
Mmm.

26:39.149 --> 26:41.050
Why do you ask?
I don't know.

26:41.085 --> 26:43.953
At one time, you and Peter
thought it would be fun
if the four of us hung out.

26:43.987 --> 26:45.988
Yeah, at one time.

26:46.023 --> 26:48.157
Maybe we should
hang out tonight.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.893
Maybe you and Peter and Hayley
could come over,

26:50.928 --> 26:52.995
and we could all do
something together.
What?

26:53.030 --> 26:54.497
But if you and Peter
don't want us

26:54.531 --> 26:56.466
hanging around with you,
I completely understand.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.468
Oh, no, no.
It-- It's just

26:58.502 --> 27:01.704
I don't think it's a great idea
to bring Hayley around

27:01.738 --> 27:03.306
knowing what we know
about her and Ricky.

27:03.340 --> 27:04.707
Well, Amy's moving in
with Ricky,

27:04.741 --> 27:06.709
so she's probably
not even gonna be there.

27:06.743 --> 27:09.011
And even if she is,
who's gonna say anything?

27:09.046 --> 27:11.514
Uh, you?

27:11.548 --> 27:14.550
I didn't know Amy and Ricky
were moving in together.

27:14.585 --> 27:15.852
Yeah.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.121
Is this some sort of plan

27:18.155 --> 27:20.490
to sabotage Amy moving in
with Ricky?

27:20.524 --> 27:22.658
Oh, no.
I'm not interested in Ricky,

27:22.693 --> 27:24.527
so why would I care
if Amy moves in with Ricky?

27:24.561 --> 27:27.196
Because she won and you lost.

27:27.231 --> 27:28.865
Well, it's not a competition.

27:28.899 --> 27:29.866
It was.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.034
Well, it's not anymore.

27:32.069 --> 27:34.737
I admit,
I don't want her to leave
because she promised me

27:34.771 --> 27:36.539
we'd get through Mom and Dad
splitting up together.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.674
But she wants to leave,
so she's leaving.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.910
So you and Peter and Hayley
are free to come over.

27:40.944 --> 27:42.712
I would love
for you to come over.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.413
See you.

27:52.089 --> 27:53.356
Hi.

27:53.390 --> 27:54.390
Hi.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.392
Did Leo come by?
Yeah.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.628
Oh. I thout maybe
you'd call.

27:58.662 --> 28:00.563
You don't have bad news,
do you?

28:00.597 --> 28:03.466
I can't imagine
that he'd change his mind.
Did he change his mind?

28:03.534 --> 28:04.834
No, he didn't.

28:04.868 --> 28:06.102
Did you change your mind?

28:06.136 --> 28:08.404
No. Did you
change your mind?

28:08.438 --> 28:09.972
No.

28:10.007 --> 28:12.074
Great. Well, uh, then,

28:12.109 --> 28:13.643
when John and I
leave the nursery,

28:13.677 --> 28:15.144
we will swing by the house

28:15.179 --> 28:16.979
and pick up our things
and come on over.

28:18.182 --> 28:20.516
What?
Nothing.

28:20.551 --> 28:23.019
I just hope
this all works out, Amy.

28:23.053 --> 28:24.654
It'll all work out.

28:24.688 --> 28:26.856
I hope so.
Yeah. Me, too.

28:28.025 --> 28:30.126
I might have
changed my mind

28:30.160 --> 28:31.627
about having sex right away.

28:31.662 --> 28:34.163
We don't have to
have sex right away,
unless you want.

28:34.198 --> 28:35.698
I might want, yeah.

28:35.732 --> 28:37.600
And I thought
that's what you wanted.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.669
What's going on?
Nothing. That's fine.

28:39.703 --> 28:41.837
It's fine, what?
Yeah, that's fine.

28:41.872 --> 28:44.340
You don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do, Amy.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.542
Neither do you.
What does that mean?

28:46.577 --> 28:48.978
That you don't have to let me
move in if you don't want to.

28:49.012 --> 28:51.180
No. I want you to move in.

28:51.215 --> 28:53.249
Don't you wanna move in?
Yeah, of course.

28:53.283 --> 28:56.385
All right.
Well, I'll see you later.

28:59.756 --> 29:01.023
[sighs]

29:02.893 --> 29:05.395
<i>her's just trying. to discourage
us from doing it again.</i>

29:05.429 --> 29:07.030
It's not gonna get worse.

29:07.064 --> 29:09.432
And it wouldn't be
the second time.
It'd be the fourth.

29:09.466 --> 29:11.234
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

29:11.268 --> 29:12.268
I didn't.

29:12.302 --> 29:14.070
So what do you wanna do first?

29:14.104 --> 29:17.573
Well, I think we should start
by making out.

29:17.608 --> 29:20.176
Oh, you mean before
I come back to your house

29:20.210 --> 29:22.745
and have sex with you
in the room next to where
your mom is sleeping.

29:22.780 --> 29:25.815
I wish we had our own place
like Adrian and Ben.

29:25.849 --> 29:28.451
I don't wanna be Adrian and Ben
or Amy and Ricky.

29:28.485 --> 29:31.387
I wanna be the opposite
of Adrian and Ben
and Amy and Ricky.

29:31.422 --> 29:33.189
I think we've got
about nine years of college

29:33.223 --> 29:34.624
before we'll
have our own place.

29:34.658 --> 29:36.292
You think we're still
gonna want our own place

29:36.326 --> 29:38.094
after nine years of college?

29:38.128 --> 29:40.063
After nine years
of having sex?

29:40.097 --> 29:42.565
Oh, yeah. I think so.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.272
Do you think so?
Yeah.

29:49.306 --> 29:51.407
As long as we don't make
the whole relationship about sex

29:51.442 --> 29:53.309
and have interests together
outside of sex.

29:54.311 --> 29:56.112
That's what my mother said.

29:56.146 --> 29:57.780
[chuckles]
We do.

29:57.815 --> 30:00.283
We have--
We have interests in common
outside of sex.

30:00.317 --> 30:02.718
I don't think
we have to worry about it
even if we don't.

30:02.753 --> 30:03.820
But we do.

30:03.854 --> 30:05.922
Doesn't matter.
Not to me anyway.

30:05.956 --> 30:07.223
Hi, guys.

30:07.257 --> 30:09.292
Hi, Adrian.
Hi.

30:09.326 --> 30:11.060
I'll pick you up
at 7:00.

30:11.095 --> 30:13.262
We'll find
a common interest.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.633
Common interest?

30:17.668 --> 30:19.635
His mom said
our relationship will last

30:19.670 --> 30:21.637
as long as we have interests
outside of sex.

30:21.672 --> 30:23.606
You just started having sex.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.942
Are you already worried about
the relationship not lasting?

30:25.976 --> 30:28.945
I didn't say we had sex.
It's me.

30:28.979 --> 30:31.614
I can tell you had sex.

30:31.648 --> 30:34.217
What, is that why you're worried
the relationship won't last?

30:34.251 --> 30:35.952
Because you gave him
what he wanted?

30:35.986 --> 30:37.954
It's not just what he wanted.

30:37.988 --> 30:40.523
I also wanted.

30:40.557 --> 30:42.959
And I'm not worried.

30:42.993 --> 30:44.894
Or I wasn't, anyway.

30:44.928 --> 30:48.264
I don't know. Don't you
worry about the relationship
not lasting with Ben?

30:49.566 --> 30:51.367
Why, 'cause Ben and I
are getting married,

30:51.401 --> 30:53.603
'cause we're having a baby?
Well, yeah, and--

30:53.637 --> 30:55.404
And because we're not
having sex?

30:55.439 --> 30:57.607
We're going to have sex.
Of course.

30:57.641 --> 30:58.674
Jeez.

30:58.709 --> 31:01.777
Since you brought it up,

31:01.812 --> 31:04.147
what if things aren't that great
between you two?

31:04.181 --> 31:05.815
I mean, you only had sex
that one time.

31:05.849 --> 31:07.316
Well, so what?

31:07.351 --> 31:08.818
Ricky and Amy only had sex
that one time,

31:08.852 --> 31:10.620
and they're
moving in together.

31:10.654 --> 31:12.121
Look, Ben and I are great.

31:12.156 --> 31:14.357
Okay? We're great together.
We make a really good team.

31:14.391 --> 31:18.227
And so what if he's
only marrying me
because I'm having his baby?

31:18.262 --> 31:20.163
That doesn't mean we won't
have great sex together.

31:20.197 --> 31:23.366
Okay.
What's going on with you?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.568
You know what?
I'll tell you what's
going on with me.

31:25.602 --> 31:27.503
I used to be the sexiest girl
in this high school,

31:27.538 --> 31:29.305
and now I don't know
if I am anymore.

31:29.339 --> 31:31.807
I mean-- I mean,
I probably am.

31:31.842 --> 31:33.609
You know, but...

31:33.644 --> 31:35.344
Well, am I?

31:36.346 --> 31:37.547
Of course.

31:38.582 --> 31:40.016
I'm still sexy.

31:40.050 --> 31:41.817
Yeah.

31:41.852 --> 31:43.486
[scoffs]

31:43.520 --> 31:45.688
But I can't--

31:45.722 --> 31:48.424
I can't move into a condo
and get married

31:48.458 --> 31:51.394
and have a baby
with Ben Boykewich
when I'm feeling this insecure.

31:51.428 --> 31:53.863
I've never
felt this insecure.

31:53.897 --> 31:56.199
You know who made me feel
this insecure? Amy.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.734
You wanna know why?
Because she has turned

31:58.769 --> 32:01.537
this whole thing
into some sort of competition
between the four of us.

32:01.572 --> 32:04.106
Amy did that?

32:04.141 --> 32:06.209
Don't you think
maybe you did that?

32:06.243 --> 32:08.978
I mean, didn't you sort of
start the whole competition

32:09.012 --> 32:11.814
when you had sex with Ben
that first time?

32:11.848 --> 32:14.383
Maybe I did.

32:14.418 --> 32:16.018
You know what?

32:16.053 --> 32:18.387
I'm gonna get my game on,

32:18.422 --> 32:20.590
and I'm gonna finish it.

32:20.624 --> 32:23.025
[sighs]

32:24.294 --> 32:26.095
So you're
going through with it?

32:26.129 --> 32:27.630
You're gonna let Amy
move in with you?

32:27.664 --> 32:29.999
Yeah, I am. I want Adrian
to move in with me.

32:31.435 --> 32:32.435
What?

32:32.469 --> 32:34.670
I do.
I don't wanna get married,

32:34.705 --> 32:37.006
but I'm okay
with living together.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.708
You just said Adrian.

32:38.742 --> 32:40.109
No, I didn't.

32:40.143 --> 32:41.811
Yeah, you did.
You said,

32:41.845 --> 32:43.546
"I want Adrian
to move in with me."

32:43.580 --> 32:44.880
Why would I say that?

32:44.915 --> 32:46.382
Because you're thinking that.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.417
You're thinking you'd like
Adrian to move in with you.

32:48.452 --> 32:50.419
Not Amy, Adrian.
Don't be ridiculous.

32:50.454 --> 32:53.289
You said it. It might've
been a Freudian slip,
but you said it.

32:53.323 --> 32:55.191
I know what
a Freudian slip is.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.360
It wasn't a Freudian slip.
I didn't say it.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.795
I don't wanna live with Adrian.
Do you wanna live with Adrian?

32:59.830 --> 33:01.330
Yes, I do.

33:01.365 --> 33:03.266
I wanna marry her,
live with her,

33:03.300 --> 33:04.767
and be a parent
to our daughter with her.

33:04.801 --> 33:06.235
Can you say the same thing
about Amy?

33:06.270 --> 33:07.737
No, I can't.

33:07.771 --> 33:09.238
I don't wanna get married.

33:09.273 --> 33:10.740
So sue me.

33:10.774 --> 33:12.942
I'm 18. I haven't graduated
from high school,

33:12.976 --> 33:15.077
and I wanna go to college.

33:15.112 --> 33:17.280
I wanna graduate from college
before I get married.

33:17.314 --> 33:20.416
Since when?
Since your dad suggested
I go to college.

33:20.450 --> 33:22.285
Oh, okay, I see.

33:22.319 --> 33:25.488
It's not enough for us
to compete with Adrian
and Amy and our children.

33:25.522 --> 33:27.089
Now we gotta bring
my dad into it.

33:27.124 --> 33:29.458
You're gonna do
what my dad wants you to do

33:29.493 --> 33:30.926
even if
you don't wanna do it?

33:30.961 --> 33:33.396
And you're gonna do
what your dad
doesn't want you to do

33:33.430 --> 33:34.864
even if
you don't wanna do it?

33:34.898 --> 33:37.900
There is no way
you wanna get married
and move into that condo.

33:37.934 --> 33:40.670
There's not.
There's no way you want Amy
and John to move in with you.

33:40.704 --> 33:42.138
I know you.
And I know you.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.941
I'm gonna do
what I think is right.

33:45.976 --> 33:47.109
And so am I.

33:47.144 --> 33:48.911
And what--
what is that, huh?

33:48.945 --> 33:50.780
What do you think is right?

33:50.814 --> 33:52.615
I'm gonna be honest,
and I'm going to admit

33:52.649 --> 33:54.617
that I changed my mind.

33:54.651 --> 33:56.686
Well, I can't.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.187
Okay? I--

33:58.221 --> 34:00.990
I might want to,
but I can't.

34:01.024 --> 34:03.159
Yes, you can.

34:03.193 --> 34:06.429
Neither of us is ready
for a lifetime commitment.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.231
You might have to make
a lifetime commitment
to the baby,

34:09.266 --> 34:11.634
but you don't have to make
a lifetime commitment to Adrian.

34:11.668 --> 34:14.670
Not right now.
And I know you don't want to.

34:16.206 --> 34:18.174
We've gotta be men here, Ben.

34:18.208 --> 34:21.976
We've gotta admit we made a mistake
and we wanna change our minds.

34:30.097 --> 34:31.496
Uh-huh.

34:31.532 --> 34:34.100
So you hate upsetting
Dad and Ashley so much

34:34.134 --> 34:37.402
that you'd change your mind
about moving in with Ricky.
Yes.

34:37.437 --> 34:39.871
I'm sure Ricky would understand
if I change my mind.

34:39.907 --> 34:41.774
Oh, he probably would,

34:41.808 --> 34:44.243
but not if you put it off
on Dad and Ashley.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.512
Maybe if you
told him the truth.

34:46.547 --> 34:47.813
<i>What's going on, Amy?</i>

34:47.848 --> 34:49.748
Why are you really
changing your mind?

34:49.783 --> 34:51.851
<i>You stayed over
at Ricky's last weekend.</i>

34:51.885 --> 34:55.487
Did you have sex
when you spent the night
with Ricky last weekend?

34:55.522 --> 34:57.323
<i>Was it uncomfortable</i>

34:57.357 --> 35:00.226
or awkward or disappointing
in some way?

35:00.260 --> 35:01.994
This is uncomfortable.

35:02.029 --> 35:03.696
<i>No. We didn't do anything.</i>

35:03.730 --> 35:05.665
All of a sudden,

35:05.699 --> 35:07.700
I realized I was about
to have sex with a guy

35:07.734 --> 35:11.270
who's had lots of sex,
and I may not be any good at it.

35:11.305 --> 35:12.972
Wow.

35:13.006 --> 35:14.840
So you think
that sex is something

35:14.875 --> 35:17.510
that you can train for,
like the Olympics.

35:17.544 --> 35:20.947
I think sex is probably better
if you have some...

35:20.981 --> 35:24.016
technical expertise
or some practice at it.

35:24.051 --> 35:26.152
Oh, Amy.

35:28.021 --> 35:29.989
It wasn't fun at all
the first time.

35:30.023 --> 35:32.291
And it couldn't have been Ricky.
It had to have been me.

35:32.326 --> 35:34.694
And I haven't
done it since, so...

35:34.728 --> 35:37.530
So that's why
you have to be very particular

35:37.564 --> 35:39.665
about who you decide
to have sex with,

35:39.700 --> 35:41.434
because it's
a learning experience.

35:41.468 --> 35:44.804
<i>And it can be a lot of fun
and make you feel</i>

35:44.838 --> 35:46.005
really close and happy,

35:46.039 --> 35:47.640
or it can be embarrassing
and awkward

35:47.674 --> 35:49.041
and make you feel empty
and miserable.

35:49.076 --> 35:51.410
[whispering]
Yeah, more of that.
[blow lands]

35:51.445 --> 35:53.045
<i>And do you think
that Ricky loves you</i>

35:53.080 --> 35:54.447
the same way
that you love him?

35:54.481 --> 35:55.915
I think so.

35:55.949 --> 35:58.384
Well, he's never told you
that he loves you?

35:58.418 --> 36:00.686
No.
I'm kind of surprised.

36:00.721 --> 36:02.888
I'm not.
I'm not.

36:02.923 --> 36:05.124
Mom, he's never had
anyone in his life

36:05.158 --> 36:06.659
he could really love or trust,

36:06.693 --> 36:09.528
and I think he's afraid
of getting that close to anyone,
even me.

36:09.563 --> 36:13.299
Well, maybe he's just as afraid
to have sex with you
as you are to have sex with him.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.034
He's had lots of sex.

36:15.068 --> 36:17.837
Not with women he loves.
He loved Adrian.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.706
Yeah, well, maybe he did,
but that didn't work out.

36:20.741 --> 36:22.708
And sometimes things
don't work out.

36:31.952 --> 36:34.153
[knocking]

36:36.590 --> 36:39.558
Oh, hi. I wasn't sure
if you were coming over.

36:39.593 --> 36:42.762
You never called
or texted or anything.

36:42.796 --> 36:44.930
I wasn't coming over,

36:44.965 --> 36:46.832
but I wanted to talk to you.

36:46.867 --> 36:49.001
What, before Peter
and Hayley get here?

36:49.036 --> 36:51.270
I didn't invite them.

36:52.639 --> 36:55.007
I wanted to spend
some time with you.

36:55.042 --> 36:56.642
Especially if Amy's moving out,

36:56.677 --> 36:59.879
I thought that you might be,
you know, kind of lonely.

36:59.946 --> 37:01.814
And while you say
you're okay

37:01.848 --> 37:04.784
with being alone all the time,
I don't think you are.

37:04.818 --> 37:05.818
I am.

37:05.852 --> 37:07.486
Were you really
gonna have me

37:07.521 --> 37:09.522
bring Hayley over
and hope that she somehow

37:09.556 --> 37:11.390
revealed that she slept
with Ricky?

37:11.425 --> 37:15.127
Well, I wouldn't hope for that.

37:15.162 --> 37:18.030
But if it happened,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

37:18.065 --> 37:19.398
Amy should know.

37:19.433 --> 37:21.400
No, she shouldn't.

37:21.435 --> 37:24.036
Hayley didn't mean
anything to Ricky.

37:24.071 --> 37:27.773
She went to the butcher shop
and conned him into
having sex with her.

37:27.808 --> 37:30.876
He tried to turn her down.
At least that's what she says.

37:30.911 --> 37:32.645
Yeah. Whatever.

37:32.679 --> 37:34.113
He didn't turn her down,

37:34.147 --> 37:36.215
and he's not gonna turn her
or another girl down

37:36.249 --> 37:38.017
just because Amy's
living with him.

37:38.051 --> 37:40.853
You don't know that,
and I don't know that.

37:40.887 --> 37:42.421
We can't know that.

37:42.456 --> 37:44.824
We can't know
what really happens
in people's bedrooms,

37:44.858 --> 37:46.659
so we have to stay out of it.

37:46.693 --> 37:50.463
And, Ashley, I'd be
really disappointed if you
didn't stay out of this one.

37:50.497 --> 37:51.797
Just leave it alone, okay?

37:51.832 --> 37:54.133
Let Amy and Ricky do
whatever they're going to do

37:54.167 --> 37:56.068
or not do.

37:56.103 --> 37:57.737
Just forget about him, okay?

37:57.771 --> 37:59.505
I mean, I'm surprised

37:59.539 --> 38:02.641
your sister's
still speaking to you
after you kissed Ricky

38:02.676 --> 38:06.245
and after you showed up
at his apartment, in his bed.

38:06.279 --> 38:08.948
You don't wanna cause her
any trouble

38:08.982 --> 38:11.817
by pointing out that Ricky
slept with Hayley.

38:11.852 --> 38:14.220
[Amy]
Who's Hayley?

38:19.025 --> 38:20.626
Thanks for talking to her.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.595
You're really good
at talking to the girls.

38:22.629 --> 38:24.930
Well, I am a girl.
Yes, you are.

38:24.965 --> 38:27.800
Well, you're doing okay.
They just still need
their mother.

38:27.834 --> 38:29.135
I'm doing okay?

38:29.169 --> 38:30.836
I drove all the way up here
to beg you to intervene.

38:30.871 --> 38:33.239
Well, Amy and Ashley
both have to realize

38:33.273 --> 38:35.207
that they can certainly
make their own decisions

38:35.242 --> 38:36.675
about almost everything
at their age.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.344
But they also
have to realize

38:38.378 --> 38:40.379
that those decisions
have consequences,

38:40.414 --> 38:41.814
immediate and otherwise.

38:41.848 --> 38:43.416
Let me write that down.

38:43.450 --> 38:45.818
If anyone knows that,
you know that.

38:45.852 --> 38:47.420
You don't need
to write it down.

38:47.454 --> 38:50.423
Do you miss me?
Sometimes.

38:50.490 --> 38:52.024
Really?

38:52.058 --> 38:54.126
This isn't
one of those times.

38:54.161 --> 38:55.428
[sighs]

38:55.462 --> 38:57.129
Good night, George.

38:57.164 --> 38:59.064
Good night, Anne.

39:07.741 --> 39:09.975
[door closes]

39:10.010 --> 39:11.710
[sighs]

39:13.513 --> 39:15.481
[exhales forcefully]

39:15.515 --> 39:17.149
[chuckles]

39:22.189 --> 39:23.355
[laughs]

39:23.390 --> 39:26.358
Well, we didn't get
the baby bed assembled,

39:26.393 --> 39:29.061
but I feel so much better.

39:29.095 --> 39:30.262
So much better.

39:30.297 --> 39:32.064
Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm.

39:32.098 --> 39:34.967
I-- Yeah. I do, too.
[laughs]

39:35.001 --> 39:39.305
So you liked it?
Uh, yes, I liked it.

39:39.339 --> 39:41.507
Told you it wouldn't
be too weird.

39:41.541 --> 39:42.608
It was not weird at all.
Really.

39:42.642 --> 39:44.343
And it was fun,
wasn't it?

39:44.377 --> 39:46.245
Yes.

39:46.279 --> 39:48.080
Feeling better
about getting married

39:48.114 --> 39:50.216
and spending
the rest of your life
with me and your daughter?

39:50.250 --> 39:53.285
Mm-hmm.
Much, much, much better.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.221
Totally ready. No anxiety.

39:55.255 --> 39:56.689
[chuckles]
Me, too.

39:56.723 --> 39:59.124
We're gonna get through
all this.
Yeah, we will.

39:59.159 --> 40:00.926
I love you, Benny.

40:00.961 --> 40:03.395
I love you, Adrian.

40:05.832 --> 40:08.734
Mmm, this is gonna be
so fun.

40:08.768 --> 40:12.404
A little challenging
getting married
and having a baby this young.

40:12.439 --> 40:13.706
But still, fun.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.275
[chules]
Yeah.

40:25.418 --> 40:26.385
Wow.

40:26.419 --> 40:28.287
Yeah. Wow.

40:28.321 --> 40:30.456
I still got it.
[laughing]

40:30.490 --> 40:31.524
[chuckling]

40:33.393 --> 40:35.227
[knocking]

40:36.897 --> 40:39.398
Where have you been?
I was getting worried about you.

40:39.432 --> 40:40.666
Where's John?

40:40.700 --> 40:42.301
Where's all your stuff?

40:46.573 --> 40:48.774
John is totally
off his schedule,

40:48.808 --> 40:50.976
so I thought I'd bring him by
tomorrow night.

40:51.011 --> 40:52.378
And I wanted to talk.

40:52.412 --> 40:54.680
All right. About what?

40:56.416 --> 40:59.218
I don't think I'm ready
to move in with you
just right yet.

40:59.252 --> 41:00.986
Really?

41:02.222 --> 41:04.723
Really. Why not?

41:04.758 --> 41:06.926
Can we sit down?

41:06.960 --> 41:09.194
Oh, yeah. Sit, please.

41:09.229 --> 41:11.363
Sit anywhere you want.

41:18.972 --> 41:21.674
I'm really nervous
about moving in with you.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.342
It's a big step-- moving in.

41:23.376 --> 41:24.743
Yes, it is, Amy.

41:24.778 --> 41:26.645
And I'd want you
to be comfortable.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.980
Completely comfortable.

41:28.014 --> 41:30.482
And I'd want you
to be completely comfortable.

41:30.517 --> 41:33.285
I'd want you to really want me
to be here with you.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.287
I wouldn't want you to feel
as if I'm pushing you

41:35.322 --> 41:37.957
to let me live with you
just because Adrian and Ben
are getting married.

41:37.991 --> 41:41.060
But you are kind of doing that,
not that I'm not okay with that.

41:41.094 --> 41:42.528
Are you?

41:42.562 --> 41:44.763
Because I'm being
completely honest with you,

41:44.798 --> 41:47.366
so I hope you can be
honest with me.

41:48.768 --> 41:50.703
You want me
to be honest with you?

41:50.737 --> 41:51.770
Completely honest?

41:51.805 --> 41:54.306
Can you be completely honest?

41:54.341 --> 41:56.442
'Cause I suspect
that you left out a few things

41:56.476 --> 42:00.012
that you did
over those four weeks
when I was in New York,

42:00.046 --> 42:02.748
and you kind of just went along
with what I wanted,

42:02.782 --> 42:06.085
apparently out of guilt.

42:06.119 --> 42:08.053
Just a guess.

42:12.225 --> 42:14.526
So, I was thinking

42:14.561 --> 42:17.463
maybe I could spend the night
over here every once in a while,

42:17.497 --> 42:19.632
and then maybe build up

42:19.666 --> 42:22.134
to staying on the weekends
and eventually move in,

42:22.168 --> 42:23.636
if we're both comfortable
with that.

42:23.670 --> 42:25.537
Sounds good.

42:25.572 --> 42:28.941
And if, uh,
[chuckles]

42:28.975 --> 42:31.610
if we find out that we like
having sex with each other.

42:31.645 --> 42:34.980
Why wouldn't we like
having sex with each other?

42:35.015 --> 42:37.282
I don't know.

42:44.224 --> 42:46.291
We're gonna like
having sex with each other.

42:46.326 --> 42:47.660
I hope so.

42:47.694 --> 42:49.428
I know so.

42:50.397 --> 42:54.600
Well, I guess we'll find out.

42:54.634 --> 42:56.635
I guess we will.

43:02.876 --> 43:03.842
Good night.

43:03.910 --> 43:05.577
Wait. Wait.

43:05.612 --> 43:07.579
Since we don't
have John tonight,

43:07.614 --> 43:09.448
maybe you'd like
to find out tonight.

43:10.383 --> 43:12.184
No, not tonight.

43:12.218 --> 43:13.952
Maybe another night.

43:25.699 --> 43:27.299
I love you, Amy.

43:29.035 --> 43:30.169
Really?

43:33.573 --> 43:36.375
Or are you just relieved
that I change my mind,
you're off the hook?

43:36.409 --> 43:38.277
No.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.845
Really.

43:39.879 --> 43:41.647
I love you.

43:43.783 --> 43:45.884
I love you, too, Ricky.

43:52.425 --> 43:53.492
Good night.
