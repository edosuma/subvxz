00:02.620 --> 00:04.750
At 11:15 this morning,
the LAPD engaged in a pursuit

00:04.750 --> 00:07.080
of Number One
on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.580
All departmental resources
were brought to bear

00:19.580 --> 00:21.580
on this dangerous fugitive,

00:21.580 --> 00:25.880
including our most decorated
officer, Kaydence Patton.

Considered one of the ocean's
greatest predators,

01:25.040 --> 01:27.540
the great white
is a solitary creature.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.670
Always on the hunt,
the shark glides through

01:29.670 --> 01:32.330
icy depths and coastal wat--

01:32.330 --> 01:34.120
Ben: So, just to be clear,

01:34.120 --> 01:35.790
since I left you
three days ago,

01:35.790 --> 01:37.210
I flew to New York,

01:37.210 --> 01:38.250
went to a board meeting,

01:38.250 --> 01:39.750
two Broadway shows,

01:39.750 --> 01:41.000
a charity gala,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.250
and you haven't moved.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.250
Moving is overrated.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.540
Huh. You said you had plans.
Right?

01:47.540 --> 01:49.920
Too many to come to New York
with me.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.710
Yeah, I lied about that.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.880
And you told me to embrace
being on my own.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.620
I didn't mean become
a hermit.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.710
You need to put yourself
out there, meet new people.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.380
I do. I meet dozens
of new people

01:59.380 --> 02:00.670
every day on patrol.

02:00.670 --> 02:02.540
And you arrest them.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.710
Speaking of, I have got
to get to work.

02:05.710 --> 02:06.920
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.380
I know, and --
and I appreciate it.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.040
I just -- I'm not feeling
really social right now.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.420
How many times you check
Lucy's Instagram page?

02:12.420 --> 02:13.540
None.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.540
11.

02:17.540 --> 02:20.920
John, L.A.
is full of distractions.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.330
Find yourself one.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.330
'Cause Lucy's not going
anywhere.

02:24.330 --> 02:25.830
You need to move on.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.880
Lucy:  What?

02:33.880 --> 02:35.210
Morning.
Hey.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.380
Where were you
this weekend?

02:36.380 --> 02:37.420
We, uh,
hit up a Dodger game

02:37.420 --> 02:39.460
and went to that
pop-up karaoke disco.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.120
Uh, my back
was bothering me,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.250
so I just stayed home
to take care of it.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.830
Well, cowboy up next time,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.080
'cause we can't be
the Three Amigos

02:46.080 --> 02:48.380
with just two people.
Right?

02:48.380 --> 02:50.500
Yeah, totally.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.210
Sgt. Grey: All right,
grab your seats.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.960
A special day here
at Mid-Wilshire.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.750
In fact, we're gonna start off
by playing a game I like to call

02:58.750 --> 03:02.000
"What is a patrol officer's
least favorite assignment?"

03:02.000 --> 03:03.880
Officer Lopez,
why don't you get us started.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.790
Easy.
Guarding a dead body.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.960
Sgt. Grey: Solid one.
Officer Bradford?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.620
Canvassing in the rain.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.920
Bishop.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.750
Driving the drunk wagon.
It's just nasty.

03:13.750 --> 03:14.920
Without a doubt.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.540
And yet, for me,

03:17.540 --> 03:20.290
the absolute worst is...

03:20.290 --> 03:22.880
the VIP ride along.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.460
Officers:

03:25.460 --> 03:26.830
Why?
That sounds like fun.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.000
Officer Bishop, would you like
to inform your boot

03:29.000 --> 03:31.250
why the ride along tops my list?

03:31.250 --> 03:35.420
Because if anything happens
to your VIP, it's your ass.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.210
So, you take the lowest
of low-risk calls.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.920
It makes a 12-hour shift
feel twice as long.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.330
Plus, you're trapped
in a car all day

03:41.330 --> 03:44.040
with an entitled prima donna
coated in body spray.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.250
Officer Nolan,

03:46.250 --> 03:48.500
you want to take a guess
why we're playing this game?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.880
Because you're giving me
the VIP ride along?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.580
-No.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.330
No. You absolutely got
the ride along.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.000
He's waiting in the Captain's
office for you now.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.290
Sir, is it too late
to ask for a sick day?

04:01.290 --> 04:04.040
-Yes, it is.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.460
Thank you
so much for allowing this.
Of course.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.620
LAPD always appreciates when
Hollywood gets it right.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.920
Ah, no danger of that
with me, huh?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.000
No, I-I'm just moving this movie
franchise of mine

04:16.000 --> 04:17.460
from New York to L.A.,

04:17.460 --> 04:19.000
so I thought I should
get out on the street here,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.880
see how L.A.'s finest
get things done.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.040
What movie is that?

04:22.040 --> 04:23.250
Nolan: It's "Trading Fire."

04:23.250 --> 04:24.920
And if Five
is half as good as Four,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.420
I will be a happy man.

04:26.420 --> 04:29.170
Mr. Payne, meet Officers
Talia Bishop and John Nolan.

04:29.170 --> 04:30.290
You'll be riding
with them today.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.040
-It's a pleasure.
-I am such a huge fan.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.120
Oh, I'm so excited
to be riding along

04:35.120 --> 04:37.420
with the oldest rookie
in the world.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.210
I don't -- uh, well,
I wouldn't say world.

04:39.210 --> 04:41.670
Don't sell yourself short,
James.
John.

04:41.670 --> 04:44.290
Captain, once again, thank you
so much for allowing this.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.960
I know the rules
of the ride along.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.460
I'll be happy with whatever
level of calls you give us.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.080
I appreciate that,
but we will make sure

04:50.080 --> 04:51.380
that you get to see
some action.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.460
Great. Great.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.290
He does not get
anywhere near danger.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.420
Is that understood?

04:59.420 --> 05:01.500
Yes, ma'am.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.330
♪♪

05:05.330 --> 05:07.000
It is such an honor
to be the one --

05:07.000 --> 05:08.790
So, what's it gonna cost me

05:08.790 --> 05:11.170
to get to see
some real action, huh?

05:11.170 --> 05:14.460
And don't forget I have what
they call "stupid money."

05:14.460 --> 05:15.620
If you don't put that away,
this ride along

05:15.620 --> 05:17.460
is gonna be over
before it even starts.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.080
Tough negotiator, huh?

05:22.080 --> 05:25.330
She's not negotiating.

05:25.330 --> 05:27.540
Jackson: I heard a rumor.
Lopez: About what?

05:27.540 --> 05:30.040
My dad said a detective position
is opening up,

05:30.040 --> 05:32.380
and you and Talia
are top contenders.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.330
So, I would keep an eye out
for The Tap.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.040
What do you know
about The Tap?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.290
It's how
the higher-ups signal

05:38.290 --> 05:40.120
that you're a shoo-in
for detective.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.540
"Officer, you should think about
taking the exam."

05:42.540 --> 05:43.880
Wink, wink.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.420
I am so ready to move up.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.580
Did your dad
say anything else?

05:48.580 --> 05:51.170
Anything I can use
to get a leg up over Talia?

05:51.170 --> 05:53.580
No. Mnh-mnh.

05:53.580 --> 05:56.210
Listen, I really shouldn't
have told you that.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.290
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.420
But I definitely appreciate
the heads up.

06:02.540 --> 06:05.580
Dispatch: 7-Adam-7, reporting
a possible assault in progress.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.170
Sounds like
someone's getting killed.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.420
Police! Open up!

06:18.500 --> 06:21.000
What the hell
are you doing?
Nothing.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.250
Uh, no, I've --
I've heard of this before.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.040
Did you shock yourself so you
can feel an adrenaline rush?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.210
Dude, y-you should try it.

06:27.210 --> 06:28.750
It really just clears
the sinuses.

06:29.710 --> 06:31.250
Where did all this stuff
come from?

06:31.250 --> 06:34.080
The Jason bought it
from a friend.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.330
Really? And where exactly
does your friend work?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.750
The...hospital store.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.580
Okay.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.880
Look, The Jason is gonna
put on The Handcuffs,

06:45.880 --> 06:48.330
because he's under arrest.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.880
Hold up, Boot.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.460
We're not looking
to arrest this guy.
We're not?

06:53.460 --> 06:55.710
Not if he can point us towards
someone more worthy of jail.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.290
How about it?

06:57.290 --> 06:59.170
I can make the charges go away,
but to do that,

06:59.170 --> 07:00.380
I need to know
the name of the guy

07:00.380 --> 07:02.500
you got all this stolen
equipment from.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.670
S-Sorry.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.880
The battery was dead, so they
had to find us another shop,

07:10.880 --> 07:12.250
and then I had
to put gas in it.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.380
But we're ready
to roll now, so...

07:14.380 --> 07:16.460
You know, when I was a
rookie, I got here two
hours before roll call

07:16.460 --> 07:17.880
to get the best shop
from motor pool,

07:17.880 --> 07:19.830
re-wash it,
and load the gear.

07:19.830 --> 07:23.460
Is this the cop version of
walking five miles in the snow?

07:23.460 --> 07:25.210
This isn't story time, Boot.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.290
I'm reminding you
how easy you have it.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.580
Understood, sir.

07:28.580 --> 07:31.000
Thank you
for all your support.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.080
Officer Bradford, Sergeant Grey
wants to see you in his office.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.880
Get the shop set up.
I'll be right back.
Here you go.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.210
Does this vest
make me look fat?

07:39.210 --> 07:41.120
What, are you kidding?
You look like you're ready

07:41.120 --> 07:42.960
to star in
"Trading Fire Five."

07:42.960 --> 07:46.420
Yeah, I've been training
with these special forces guys.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.920
Oh, the same guys who trained
Tom for the last movie?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.580
I watch all the
behind-the-scenes videos.

07:50.580 --> 07:51.830
Dispatch: Wilshire units,

07:51.830 --> 07:53.670
we have shots fired,
MacArthur Park.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.620
Let's go to that.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.120
Guys, let's go to that.
I've got Lakers tickets

07:58.120 --> 07:59.960
with your name on them
if you say yes.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.500
Sorry,
I'm a Clippers gal.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.670
Jonah, can you help me out,
please?

08:02.670 --> 08:05.670
Me? Um...sorry.

08:05.670 --> 08:08.960
The T.O. dictates
which calls we take.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.460
Dispatch:
7-Adam-15, possible 459

08:11.460 --> 08:13.960
at 910 Seabright Place.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.460
7-Adam-15 responding.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.750
What's a 459?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.040
Real, authentic
police work.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.290
Yeah.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.500
Come in.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.000
That's not a good sign.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.580
No, it's not.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.620
Look, there's no easy way
to say this.

08:34.620 --> 08:37.290
I was just notified that
detectives made a drug bust.

08:37.290 --> 08:39.540
I recognized
the suspect's name.

08:39.540 --> 08:40.380
It's your wife.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.750
What's the charge?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.880
Possession
with intent to sell.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.080
They're bringing her in?

08:50.080 --> 08:53.120
Yeah.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.120
I don't know
all the details yet,

08:55.120 --> 08:57.790
but I wanted to warn you.

08:57.790 --> 09:00.080
So,
obviously, this is a
complicated situation,

09:00.080 --> 09:03.170
but know that the department
has your back.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.000
Whatever you need,
just ask, okay?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.540
Yes, sir.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.540
Really? We passed up
a shoot

09:12.540 --> 09:15.250
Well, the neighbors reported
hearing disturbing noises.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.250
That could be serious.
Huh. Doubtful.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.380
Listen, you want to see the
difference between New York cops

09:19.380 --> 09:21.830
and L.A. ones, right?
Yep.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.750
Well, New York has 40,000
officers policing their streets.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.880
L.A. only has 9,000 operating
in a city twice its size.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.080
We see a hell of a lot more
action every shift.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.250
Yeah, you never know when
that action's gonna happen.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.080
Some of these "smaller" calls
