You can sleep with me in private
but you can't talk to me in public?

00:08.793 --> 00:11.574
The reason that I keep bringing up
our kiss is because...

00:11.699 --> 00:13.304
I like like you.

00:13.429 --> 00:16.265

I got the attention I was looking for.

was *****.

00:30.946 --> 00:33.340
She was all about
crossing inappropriate boundaries.

00:33.465 --> 00:37.603
So the fact that she was finally
acting appropriate felt suspicious.

00:37.728 --> 00:39.387
Something was definitely up.

00:39.908 --> 00:41.645
I forgot the cupcakes.

in the air.

Maybe an earthquake
was about to hit.

another natural disaster--

00:59.546 --> 01:04.382
my mom's BFF Ally.

01:21.634 --> 01:23.100
Oh, I didn't tell you?

01:23.102 --> 01:25.069
My suspicions were correct.

to cushion the blow.

an ally injection.

This was coming from a woman
who had simply referred to me

I know how we can fix
your pity party.

We're gonna throw
a kickass kegger

02:27.033 --> 02:29.767

around here!

- No way!

There is no way
we are having a party.

I end up at child services.

Cool. We're gonna bet
on some.

a simple kickback?

chatting up any barneys.

- Jenna,

stop being so ungrateful!

03:46.112 --> 03:49.380
Your aunt Ally is being
very generous and open with you.

03:49.382 --> 03:51.882
The only think open
about Ally were her legs.

03:51.884 --> 03:54.118
Ally is not my aunt,
and while I appreciate

03:54.120 --> 03:56.954
the gesture of her gift,
I don't want it.

beer, or should I bring some?

- Uh...German.
- Me too.

with this party,
