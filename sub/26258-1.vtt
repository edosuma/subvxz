00:27.722 --> 00:32.670
Long ago, Xadia was one land...

00:33.903 --> 00:38.279
rich in magic and wonder.

00:43.509 --> 00:50.326
In the old times, there were only
the six Primal Sources of magic...

00:51.517 --> 00:55.318
The Sun. The Moon.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.738
The Stars.

01:01.135 --> 01:02.762
The Earth.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.542
The Sky.

01:11.262 --> 01:13.099
And the Ocean.

01:15.251 --> 01:21.906
But a thousand years ago,
a human mage discovered new magic...

01:22.113 --> 01:24.717
the seventh source.

01:24.804 --> 01:26.490
Dark Magic.

01:35.690 --> 01:40.979
It used the essence
within magical creatures themselves

01:41.508 --> 01:45.838
to unleash dark power.

02:00.089 --> 02:02.677
Horrified by what they saw,

02:02.764 --> 02:07.672
the elves and the dragons
put a stop to the madness.

02:07.759 --> 02:12.135
They drove every last human to the west.

02:12.273 --> 02:16.666
And so, the continent was divided in two.

02:16.898 --> 02:20.408
In the east, the magical lands of Xadia.

02:20.495 --> 02:24.549
And in the west, the human kingdoms.

02:27.242 --> 02:33.580
For centuries, the King of the Dragons
himself defended the border.

02:40.505 --> 02:44.377
- Forward!
- Forward!

02:51.182 --> 02:55.856
The humans called him Thunder,
for when he spoke,

02:55.943 --> 03:00.916
his voice shook the Earth and the sky.

03:02.754 --> 03:07.325
But on the eve of last Winter's Turn,

03:07.412 --> 03:14.136
the humans used unspeakable Dark Magic
to slay Thunder.

03:14.289 --> 03:20.320
Then, without mercy,
they destroyed his only egg, his heir...

03:20.407 --> 03:23.229
the Dragon Prince.

03:23.881 --> 03:30.194
Now the world stands on the edge
of all-out war.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.986
Take that, marshmallow monster.

04:23.952 --> 04:26.482
Callum!

04:26.569 --> 04:27.942
It's okay, Ezran.

04:28.029 --> 04:30.622
It's just a thunderstorm.
Nothing to be afraid of.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.266
Go back to sleep.

04:32.734 --> 04:34.550
I wasn't scared...

04:35.036 --> 04:36.461
Bait was scared.

04:56.732 --> 04:58.290
Who's there?

05:01.521 --> 05:04.163
Declare yourself,
in the name of King Harrow!

05:42.938 --> 05:44.256
Please!

05:46.357 --> 05:48.041
Who are you?

06:32.998 --> 06:35.698
High Mage! Please, it's urgent!

06:41.579 --> 06:44.440
Lord Viren! I've seen something.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.510
Lord Viren, uh...
King Harrow hasn't risen yet.

07:07.605 --> 07:11.596
Viren, didn't I tell you if you ever
woke me up this early again...

07:11.683 --> 07:13.917
I'd have you executed?

07:14.112 --> 07:17.129
I'll give you a moment.

07:28.130 --> 07:32.774
So, what's so important that you come into
my bedroom risking your life like this?

07:33.425 --> 07:34.922
Assassins.

07:35.136 --> 07:36.476
I see.

07:36.634 --> 07:40.330
A scout on patrol discovered them
just before dawn.

07:40.555 --> 07:44.149
Well, don't look so grim.
We've fought off plenty of assassins.

07:44.236 --> 07:45.347
Haven't we, Pip?

07:45.434 --> 07:47.235
It's different this time.

07:47.322 --> 07:50.682
We believe they're Moonshadow elves.

07:51.399 --> 07:55.376
Moonshadow elves?
Then how did the scout escape?

07:55.789 --> 07:59.026
I don't know. It was muddy, wet, dark...

07:59.164 --> 08:01.965
Somehow he got very lucky.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.916
The Crown Guard won't be enough
to hold them off.

08:05.246 --> 08:08.284
Send for General Amaya
and the Standing Battalion.

08:08.583 --> 08:12.267
The Breach is too far.
They'll never make it back in time.

08:13.062 --> 08:14.697
What's tonight's moon?

08:14.859 --> 08:16.271
Full.

08:16.591 --> 08:18.881
Of course it is...

08:18.968 --> 08:22.361
With the Moonshadow elves
at the height of their power,

08:22.611 --> 08:25.003
no defense will stand against them.

08:25.266 --> 08:28.955
Then we won't defend. We will attack.

08:29.187 --> 08:32.347
We must find them today,
in the light of the sun,

08:32.433 --> 08:34.491
and stop them before it's too late.

09:26.703 --> 09:28.336
Well done, Rayla.

09:28.423 --> 09:31.430
Yeah. I used both of them.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.133
I can see that.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.614
Bait, shh.

10:11.202 --> 10:15.172
Prince Ezran!
I caught you!

10:15.259 --> 10:17.883
I was just... admiring them.

10:17.970 --> 10:19.968
Oh. With your hands?

10:20.055 --> 10:23.670
Yeah. They look amazing.

10:23.757 --> 10:27.184
Well, they are amazing,
and they're not for you!

10:27.271 --> 10:30.204
Or your little monster, Bait.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.845
Did you just...

10:32.932 --> 10:35.491
You can tell by his eyes he's innocent.

10:37.479 --> 10:41.289
Are you kidding me?
I'm standing right here.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.935
Hey!

11:02.037 --> 11:05.034
Prince Callum.
Today we focus on the art of...

11:05.121 --> 11:07.591
Art! Finally something I'm good at.

11:09.231 --> 11:11.665
Sorry, sorry. Won't interrupt again.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.305
Please... continue, Soren.

11:15.225 --> 11:19.469
The art of defense
is critical in sword-fighting.

11:19.562 --> 11:22.989
Parrying is about angle, motion,
anticipation...

11:23.076 --> 11:27.001
Misjudge your opponent,
and it's over. You ready?

11:29.781 --> 11:31.748
Uh, I'm gonna have to say no.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.050
Great. Let's do this.

11:37.956 --> 11:41.057
Parry, parry, parry... You're dead.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.458
Parry, parry... You're dead.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.645
Parry... Dead.

11:46.131 --> 11:48.640
Really? Are you sure?
Even if I was wearing armor?

11:48.727 --> 11:51.685
Even if you were wearing
the rarest legendary armor,

11:51.763 --> 11:53.280
forged by Sunfire elves...

11:53.348 --> 11:54.361
Super dead.

11:54.429 --> 11:56.387
- I'm terrible at this!
- Yep.

11:56.474 --> 11:58.108
But you have to practice anyway,

11:58.195 --> 12:00.534
because that's what's expected
of a prince.

12:00.770 --> 12:03.697
- Or a step-prince, actually.
- What?

12:03.784 --> 12:04.858
What?

12:15.714 --> 12:17.057
Hey, your sister.

12:17.144 --> 12:19.420
- She's gonna walk right into that...
- Shh.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.355
Claudia!

12:24.919 --> 12:27.144
Oh. Hi, Callum!

12:28.381 --> 12:30.690
You're no fun.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.561
- Is this new?
- Relatively new.

12:34.648 --> 12:37.981
It's only been there for 300 years.

12:41.978 --> 12:45.913
Hey, uh, can we try again?
I think I can do it now.

12:56.115 --> 12:58.825
- What was that?
- I don't know.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.504
Uh, I was trying to "sweep the leg"?

13:01.591 --> 13:04.598
That's not a thing in sword-fighting.

13:07.045 --> 13:09.235
Oh.

13:09.339 --> 13:11.605
I see what's going on here.

13:12.091 --> 13:14.132
Don't worry, I'll help.

13:14.219 --> 13:16.110
You come at me this time.

13:18.892 --> 13:23.630
Oh, I am stabbed!
By the stab-prince!

13:23.717 --> 13:27.580
Lord Stabbington! Why? Spurt!

13:27.828 --> 13:28.928
Spurt!

13:29.192 --> 13:31.920
Nice work, Callum.

13:32.007 --> 13:34.106
He deserves it.

13:35.114 --> 13:38.632
Prince Callum.
The King needs to speak with you urgently.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.852
He didn't really stab me.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.857
Boys!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.059
You're going on a trip.

13:56.146 --> 13:57.967
To the Banther Lodge!

13:58.054 --> 14:00.939
But... it's spring.
That's the winter lodge.

14:01.026 --> 14:04.807
Eh. Winter is coming... eventually.

14:04.894 --> 14:09.155
What will we do? Everything fun there
has to do with snow or ice.

14:09.242 --> 14:13.827
Maybe you can invent new versions using...
dirt and rocks.

14:13.914 --> 14:16.663
You could build a dirt man! Or...

14:16.750 --> 14:18.743
what about mud-sledding?

14:18.830 --> 14:20.674
That could be a thing!

14:23.553 --> 14:26.423
Look, this is something I need you to do.

14:26.510 --> 14:28.748
- Dad...
- It's decided.

14:28.835 --> 14:32.103
You'll leave before sundown,
so go get packed up.

14:32.190 --> 14:34.399
Yes, sir. Come on, Ez.

14:37.927 --> 14:41.010
Why's he sending us away?
Something's wrong.

14:41.097 --> 14:45.116
Everything's going to be fine.
All right? I'm sure of it.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.666
What's going on, Father?

14:54.777 --> 14:57.305
We have visitors from Xadia...

14:57.614 --> 14:59.885
Unwanted visitors.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.532
What are they, minstrels or something?

15:02.619 --> 15:05.879
- Assassins.
- I know! What do you think, I'm an idiot?

15:08.166 --> 15:11.718
They've set up a secret camp
somewhere near the base of the cliffs.

15:11.805 --> 15:13.762
Soren, you will lead an attack.

15:13.849 --> 15:17.046
Right. Their secret camp.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.734
How am I supposed to find it
if it's secret?

15:20.887 --> 15:24.762
These assassins are Moonshadow elves.

15:24.849 --> 15:27.442
They draw power from the Moon.

15:27.529 --> 15:33.271
Inside this box is an Archangel Lunaris...
a giant moon moth.

15:33.358 --> 15:35.909
It will be drawn to their energy.

15:35.996 --> 15:39.235
Follow it, and you will find them.

15:39.322 --> 15:42.118
And what happens if I can't find them?

15:42.205 --> 15:45.491
Then we may be
on the brink of changing times.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.345
You're saying they'll kill the king?

15:57.382 --> 15:59.255
Discretion, boy!

15:59.342 --> 16:01.267
- Do you want to cause a panic?
- I'm sorry...

16:01.354 --> 16:05.177
Just get out there and find them.
Before sundown!

16:05.264 --> 16:10.485
So, if these are really Moonshadow elves,
then once the moon rises...

16:10.572 --> 16:12.953
They'll be unstoppable.

16:13.064 --> 16:15.615
Well, I'm going to find a way
to stop them.

16:15.702 --> 16:19.536
After all, "unstoppable"
is just another kind of "stoppable."

16:19.623 --> 16:21.534
No. That's not really right.

16:21.621 --> 16:24.157
Yeah, it made more sense in my head.

16:31.068 --> 16:35.226
Wait, I'm coming with you!

16:35.476 --> 16:37.331
You look terrific.

16:37.561 --> 16:41.130
But, just so you know,
that's ceremonial armor.

16:41.217 --> 16:45.868
It's three times as heavy
and half as strong. Oh, but so shiny!

16:45.967 --> 16:49.997
I don't care. I know what's going on
and I'm coming with you.

16:50.084 --> 16:53.982
- You're just a kid, Callum.
- I'll be 15 in two months.

16:54.069 --> 16:56.872
Ooh, fourteen and three quarters! Wow!

16:56.983 --> 17:00.094
Five-sixths. Soren, he's our king.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.407
And he's my father.
It's my duty to help him.

17:03.494 --> 17:06.839
Well, technically he is your step-dad.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.480
But I'm sure it's similar. Think fast!

17:13.342 --> 17:15.852
You were supposed to catch it.

17:30.576 --> 17:34.743
Four full moons past,
on the eve of the Winter's Turn,

17:34.830 --> 17:39.509
the humans crossed into Xadia
and murdered the King of the Dragons.

17:39.662 --> 17:43.946
Then they destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

17:44.180 --> 17:48.325
Tonight we bind our lives to justice!

17:48.412 --> 17:52.266
- My breath for freedom!
- My eyes for truth!

17:52.428 --> 17:56.682
- My strength for honor!
- My blood for justice!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.685
My heart for Xadia!

18:02.799 --> 18:06.837
Life is precious. Life is valuable.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.571
We take it, but we do not take it lightly.

18:15.937 --> 18:20.831
Moon reflects sun, as death reflects life!

18:34.163 --> 18:36.954
When it is done, I will send a shadowhawk

18:37.041 --> 18:40.552
with a blood ribbon message
to the Queen of the Dragons.

18:40.639 --> 18:44.188
We strike when the moon is highest!

18:46.050 --> 18:49.151
- Uh, Runaan?
- What is it, Rayla?

18:49.262 --> 18:53.189
I was wondering...
what if they know we're coming?

18:53.276 --> 18:55.931
We have the advantage of surprise.

18:56.018 --> 18:59.953
If we act fast, we will accomplish
our goals without sacrifice.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.640
Oh, Bait, you're terrible
at hide and seek.

19:21.085 --> 19:24.460
- Ez! What are you doing?
- Hi, Callum. Do you want a...

19:24.547 --> 19:26.796
No, I don't want a stupid jelly tart!

19:26.883 --> 19:29.767
Why aren't you packed?
You know we have to get going soon.

19:29.854 --> 19:32.218
But... you're not packed.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.655
What do you think I'm doing?

19:35.975 --> 19:38.307
Ezran! You don't get it, do you?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.820
Why do you think they're sending us away?

19:40.907 --> 19:43.622
Because they're coming to kill him!

20:02.793 --> 20:07.430
Let's see if this magic moon moth can find
more than a closet full of moon sweaters.

20:08.649 --> 20:12.583
- You know, 'cause moths eat clothes?
- Yes, sir.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.001
Let's go!

20:45.753 --> 20:47.418
They know we're here!

20:54.095 --> 20:56.153
Mystica-Arbora!

21:19.704 --> 21:22.077
Nothing!

21:22.164 --> 21:28.018
Surprising no one, a magic moth
is just as worthless as a regular moth.

21:33.009 --> 21:35.859
We'll have to wait for the elves
to come to us.

22:04.373 --> 22:06.497
You lied to me.

22:06.584 --> 22:09.792
- You let him go!
- Runaan, I'm sorry!

22:09.879 --> 22:13.765
The human... he looked up at me
and I saw the fear in his eyes.

22:13.852 --> 22:17.607
Of course he was afraid.
But you had a job to do!

22:17.694 --> 22:21.681
He didn't do anything to me!
How could I take his life?

22:21.768 --> 22:23.644
You let him live...

22:23.731 --> 22:26.118
but you've killed us all!
