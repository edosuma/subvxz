00:57.975 --> 00:59.349
Maria Garcia's lawyers

00:59.393 --> 01:02.728
asked for
a preliminary injunction.

01:02.772 --> 01:03.979
What is that in English?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.313
It would freeze all activity

01:05.357 --> 01:06.857
on the Garcia land.
My land.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.067
No drilling, no pumping,

01:08.110 --> 01:10.110
nothing till
the trial's over.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.987
Kilborne
won't let that happen.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.572
Kilborne
recused himself.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.574
What? Why?

01:15.618 --> 01:19.119
He's implicated.

01:19.163 --> 01:21.914
We bribed him to falsify
Pedro's tax payments.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.791
Can you say that
louder?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.752
I think there's a fella in
Oklahoma didn't catch you.

01:26.796 --> 01:29.296
I didn't hear a thing.
Shut up.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.925
County records
can support our side.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.552
It's her word
against the whole town's.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.387
They have a witness.
What?

01:37.431 --> 01:40.641
One of Pedro's <i> vaqueros?</i>

01:41.644 --> 01:43.519
No such luck.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.146
It gives a man
little pleasure, Your Honor,

01:46.190 --> 01:47.981
to admit
that he has been duped.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.360
Whatever embarrassment
I may feel

01:51.403 --> 01:53.028
pales in comparison

01:53.072 --> 01:57.574
to the base depravity of
Eli McCullough's misdeeds.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.125
It has been my inclination
for too long

02:06.168 --> 02:08.585
to excuse
his terrible behavior

02:08.628 --> 02:11.547
because he is
the namesake of our town.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.882
But I can do it no longer.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.342
My redemption lies

02:15.386 --> 02:18.554
in doing my part
to bring him to justice.

03:04.726 --> 03:08.770
Niles Gilbert is
a disgruntled former employee

03:08.814 --> 03:11.273
out for revenge.

03:11.317 --> 03:16.111
We may attack his credibility
at trial, counselor,

03:16.155 --> 03:20.115
but the issue before us
right now is,

03:20.159 --> 03:22.075
does this
meet the standard

03:22.119 --> 03:24.661
for a preliminary
injunction?

03:24.705 --> 03:28.457
Well, there's no irreparable
harm in drilling.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.334
So if you're client
loses at trial,

03:30.377 --> 03:32.419
he'll put the oil
back in the ground?

03:32.463 --> 03:33.837
He'll pay damages.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.589
If he's not bankrupt
by then.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.133
Let's not rehash
what's in the briefs.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.472
I'm going to err
on the side of caution.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.016
I'm not gonna
prejudge this case,

03:46.060 --> 03:48.435
but oil
is a tricky business.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.103
So I have to make sure

03:50.147 --> 03:51.939
that there's something left
to recover

03:51.982 --> 03:53.649
should Miss Garcia
prevail.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.151
The injunction is granted.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.488
Your Honor,

03:59.531 --> 04:01.198
we understand
that Mr. McCullough

04:01.242 --> 04:03.659
has already extracted
a substantial volume of oil,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.994
which he is storing
on the property.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.329
We'd like it clarified

04:07.373 --> 04:09.039
that the injunction
applies to that, too.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.209
Hold on.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.961
You said yourself

04:14.004 --> 04:16.129
we can't put this
back into the ground.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.964
I'm sorry.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.675
But if it came
out of that land,

04:19.718 --> 04:20.884
it stays put.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.544
Shh.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.712
Shh.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.425
Come on.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.222
He pushed me down
and held me there.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.558
Then he said he could kill me
whenever he wanted.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.768
- Wait, slow down, who did?
- Scalped-A-Dog.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.729
He said
he'd buy me from you,

05:13.772 --> 05:16.064
violate me,
and cut me into pieces.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.899
Well, Ingrid,
what did you do?

05:22.156 --> 05:23.780
That.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.209
I'm not sorry.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.985
Gone a long time.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.071
Went for a walk.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.453
And why are your hands
dirty?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.917
You smell different
when you're scared.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.752
You're better off
not knowing.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.594
Ingrid killed a Yap Eater.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.270
Who is it?
Scalped-A-Dog.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.772
He probably had it comin'.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.482
Where is he?
We buried him.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.484
Where?
Far away... salt mounds.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.693
Deep?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.278
As deep as I could
with my hands.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.200
We have to tell Fat Wolf. No.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.493
They'll kill her.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.370
Better her than us.
No.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.496
No, stop.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.872
They won't just kill her.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.165
They'll torture her.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.542
They'll roast her
over a slow fire

06:58.585 --> 06:59.709
and then cut her
to pieces.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.003
Eli, remember
when you were afraid.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.381
Toshaway's temper
would get us exiled?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.341
This is worse.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.385
Much worse.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.303
I'm not gonna let
our daughter die in the snow

07:10.347 --> 07:12.013
because a slave
couldn't control herself.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.017
No.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.894
No, she killed
one of the Apaches

07:17.938 --> 07:19.312
that attacked our camp.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.523
She's earned her place.
You know that.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.443
If I have to choose,
I choose my family.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.031
What about
after they kill her?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.158
After Scalped-A-Dog...

07:36.790 --> 07:38.707
Then we'll give them
a horse.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.169
It won't be
one horse or two.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.171
He'll set the <i> nanuwokitu</i>
higher than we can pay.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.381
And when we can't,

07:46.425 --> 07:49.718
he'll have the excuse
he's been looking for.

07:49.761 --> 07:53.305
He can exile Toshaway,
he can exile us.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.893
The winter will kill us.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.228
We have no choice.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.230
You see this?

08:02.274 --> 08:04.608
Fat Wolf can never know.

08:54.952 --> 08:58.245
You're very handsome.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.417
Well, you didn't think so
before.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.086
I was...

09:06.129 --> 09:07.712
scared of you.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.847
Will your wives care?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.767
They could sleep
through a thunderstorm.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.802
World is full of wonders.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.848
I'm speaking not only of
how grain becomes whiskey,

09:59.891 --> 10:03.893
but of our surprising
and productive partnership.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.147
I pray you are right,
Mr. Monahan.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.065
And that I have not
in some way

10:09.109 --> 10:10.525
injured my honor here.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.735
Oh, well, my friend...

10:13.030 --> 10:14.654
...you delivered.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.242
I do not want to look
into the mirror

10:19.286 --> 10:22.037
and see a traitor
looking back at me.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.414
That man was never gonna
do right by you,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.207
and you need
to accept that.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.168
The dirty deeds
he had you do

10:28.211 --> 10:30.211
so his hands
could stay clean.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.589
I'll tell you the truth
right now:

10:32.633 --> 10:34.382
he never saw you
as anything

10:34.426 --> 10:36.217
but a jumped-up
sharecropper.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.012
Your working man's integrity,
your loyalty

10:39.056 --> 10:40.680
is wasted
on Eli McCullough.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.061
At the time,

10:46.104 --> 10:48.480
I did not think
I was wasting it.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.613
Now, you and me,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.615
we're a lot alike.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.368
And I myself,
I used to...

11:01.411 --> 11:03.244
Used to plow fields
for a family

11:03.288 --> 11:07.290
that my family
worked for.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.418
And I thought that
I'd earn their appreciation.

11:10.462 --> 11:14.089
But if I learned one thing
it's this:

11:14.132 --> 11:15.590
to that family
we worked for,

11:15.634 --> 11:18.009
I was no better
than a slave.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.806
Well, Mr. Endicott...
The man I work for now...

11:22.849 --> 11:26.768
Same deal,
different britches.

11:26.812 --> 11:30.438
I'm merely a spoke in a wheel
on his machine,

11:30.482 --> 11:33.983
and the second I falter,
I'll be replaced.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.903
Now, the McCulloughs
and the Endicotts,

11:36.947 --> 11:38.738
they get rich.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.157
And you and me
get exploited.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.451
And that's
the way of the world.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.746
I hear you.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.251
I aim too high.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.587
No, Mr. Gilbert.

11:56.299 --> 12:00.510
I'm urging you to see me
as an example.

12:00.554 --> 12:04.806
Because I believe
that a man can rise.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.307
I have no intention

12:06.351 --> 12:09.185
of being Mr. Endicott's lackey
forever.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.438
One day...

12:11.481 --> 12:13.314
I intend to be Endicott.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.026
The hell you say.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.362
Then I'll put it to you.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.990
Why stay
Eli McCullough's hop-toad

12:22.033 --> 12:24.617
when you can be
the man himself?

12:25.871 --> 12:26.953
When you can stand

12:26.997 --> 12:28.830
and look him
square in the eye,

12:28.874 --> 12:31.666
and say,
"Make no mistake, sir.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.711
Niles Gilbert
is your peer."

12:39.092 --> 12:41.468
Well, now,
wouldn't that be something?

13:26.431 --> 13:27.806
Miss Garcia?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.562
Miss Garcia.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.524
Wait!

13:37.567 --> 13:40.109
Please!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.195
Why do you want
to hurt us?!

13:47.953 --> 13:50.453
I don't want to hurt you.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.247
That's not
what they're sayin'.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.792
What did they tell you?

13:59.798 --> 14:01.130
I'm back here

14:01.174 --> 14:04.259
because your grandfather
killed my family.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.594
That's not true.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.971
Other townsfolk did that.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.389
Daddy tried to stop them.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.560
Yes, he did try.

14:13.603 --> 14:17.063
But he was no match
for your grandfather.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.779
Daddy said
he took you to Mexico

14:24.823 --> 14:27.782
so that you'd be safe.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.285
And once you were okay,
he was coming back here.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.830
That true?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.667
Maybe you should
ask him.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.586
I did.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.468
What do you think?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.308
I think he's lying.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.479
Good luck, Jeanne Anne.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.165
Come in.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.833
Mrs. Sally.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.710
Mrs. Hurley
here to see you.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.337
Who's that?

15:22.380 --> 15:23.796
The mother of the boy
Jeanne Anne...

15:26.259 --> 15:27.467
I'll be right down.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.847
I always heard
how beautiful this house is,

15:32.891 --> 15:35.016
but the descriptions
did not do it justice.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.517
Thank you.
Oh.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.395
The dimensions
are gracious!

15:39.439 --> 15:42.523
You could practically fit
our whole house in that room.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.651
And, I mean,
I'm exaggerating, of course.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.694
How is Tommy?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.196
We were so worried.
Oh.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.697
And mortified.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.367
Jeanne Anne is being punished
as we speak.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.494
Oh. Tommy's fine.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.079
Thick head.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.039
But he did have to have
seven stitches.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.999
So...

16:00.043 --> 16:03.419
here's the bill
from Tommy's doctor.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.255
Stitches cost a lot.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.174
I see.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.553
Now, I don't excuse
what Tommy said to her.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.265
A family's private affairs
should stay private.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.103
And I know my... my husband
has strayed on me as well.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.063
Claimed to be
at a cattleman's convention.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.065
So.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.753
Let's just say there's not
a whole lot of difference

16:25.777 --> 16:27.527
between you and me.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.532
I'm gonna get you
that money now.

16:32.575 --> 16:36.035
Inez, would you bring me
the ledger?

17:11.781 --> 17:14.281
Ah, hey,
I'm glad it's you.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.284
I was worried you were
that damn Cullpepper kid

17:16.327 --> 17:17.617
with his flute.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.078
What a little asshole.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.247
Do you have
any more lessons today?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.623
Uh, no.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.959
I am sadly bereft
of tone-deaf children

17:25.002 --> 17:26.002
till tomorrow.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.672
Is everything okay?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.632
Did something happen?
No. Um...

17:31.676 --> 17:34.093
Would you like to go in back,
we could have a smoke.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.282
Does this feel good?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.661
Yeah.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.505
Matthew, um...

18:10.548 --> 18:12.799
I never, uh...

18:12.842 --> 18:14.967
I... I haven't...

18:15.720 --> 18:17.470
Only with my husband.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.683
You are a beautiful woman.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.520
And someone...

18:25.563 --> 18:28.022
someone should make you
feel that way.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.275
Watch your reflection.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.734
I know.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.448
They are building
a fort.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.909
I told you.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.120
So you were right.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.166
Those boxes,
what is in them?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.292
I don't know.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.880
Whatever it is,
there's a lot of it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.344
They're only
going to get stronger.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.513
We have to attack.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.432
I told you
this is the border.

19:44.475 --> 19:48.769
If they want a fort here,
they're gonna build a fort.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.106
No matter how many you kill,
more will come.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.108
And they will rebuild.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.041
I had Ingrid last night.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.542
What?

20:11.586 --> 20:13.461
And the night before that.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.463
Have you ever had her?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.215
No.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.633
Has my father?

20:19.510 --> 20:22.553
Toshaway and Ingrid?

20:22.597 --> 20:24.805
No.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.016
Doesn't mean
he won't some day.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.684
He won't.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.145
Be careful, Tiehteti.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.356
You think
because he calls you his son

20:33.399 --> 20:35.483
that he won't do
whatever he wants,

20:35.526 --> 20:37.693
take whatever he wants.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.195
But he will.

20:40.531 --> 20:44.659
He told me about your mother,
what he did.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.619
I think he feels bad
about it.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.165
My mother was unfaithful.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.502
She deserved what she got.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.379
I did not.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.049
He said you chose exile.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.122
You went to Fat Wolf's tipi
last night?

22:13.166 --> 22:15.458
Why?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.002
I wanted to.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.755
You're drawing attention
to yourself.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.840
That puts us all in danger,
not just you.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.800
I'm smarter
than you think I am.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.146
You told her?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.525
Stop pretending you're smart,
Dirty Hair.

22:41.569 --> 22:42.610
You're not.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.782
I went to Fat Wolf's tipi
to protect us.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.158
Us or you?

22:49.202 --> 22:52.536
I have a plan.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.954
He likes me.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.373
He does.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.292
And if I can become
one of his favorites,

22:58.336 --> 23:00.294
maybe even a wife,

23:00.338 --> 23:05.174
then I can make sure nothing bad
happens to any of us.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.551
I would never betray you,
Eli.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.970
You know this,
don't you?

23:11.057 --> 23:13.849
Do you know what I think?
Hmm?

23:13.893 --> 23:17.144
I think you're only
looking out for you.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.813
I think
you'll go to his bed

23:18.856 --> 23:20.815
and you'll toss us
out in the cold.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.203
I will cut off your nose
and make you eat it.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.267
I was so angry.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.519
I mean,
the sheer presumption.

23:58.563 --> 24:02.189
I gave her the money,
sent her on her way.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.858
I suppose that wasn't
the worst thing

24:03.901 --> 24:05.734
that I could do.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.798
Well, giving money to someone
who actually needs money

24:07.822 --> 24:09.738
is usually considered
a good thing.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.615
Maybe I could have been
more gracious.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.076
Huh, maybe so.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.953
I'm all too aware
that I was

24:15.997 --> 24:18.581
my husband's second choice
from the start.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.083
I mean, I didn't see it
till it was too late, of course,

24:21.127 --> 24:24.545
but I was swept up
in it all.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.422
And I was 18
when we got married,

24:26.466 --> 24:28.090
and I just
didn't know enough

24:28.134 --> 24:29.884
to ask
certain questions like,

24:29.927 --> 24:31.385
"Do you love me?"

24:32.638 --> 24:34.722
Also,
I had no other options.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.891
And we were gonna live
in the Austin house,

24:36.934 --> 24:38.726
so maybe I just got
swept off my feet

24:38.769 --> 24:39.894
by the thought of that.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.584
Do you realize
that while you been talking,

24:43.608 --> 24:44.899
people in Europe
have been dying?

24:46.944 --> 24:48.277
Excuse me?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.673
There is a whole world
out there, Sally,

24:49.697 --> 24:51.155
and it's dangerous,
and it's alive,

24:51.199 --> 24:52.781
and it does not care
about the problems

24:52.825 --> 24:54.617
of a rich
Texas housewife

24:54.660 --> 25:00.623
and the bad decisions
that she makes.

25:00.666 --> 25:04.460
Yeah, I know
there's a world out there.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.086
I was talking to you
about my world

25:06.130 --> 25:07.630
and things that are
important to me.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.797
Yeah, sorry.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.133
I was rude.
Rude.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.801
Oh, no, Matthew.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.428
Oh, no,
you are simply a...

25:14.472 --> 25:17.264
a bold teller of truths.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.184
You, uh, smoke
exotic cigarettes

25:20.228 --> 25:22.353
and read exciting books

25:22.396 --> 25:23.812
and you hang up
these posters

25:23.856 --> 25:25.356
of places
that you'll never go.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.317
I consider you
a very worldly man.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.444
Turn around.

25:30.488 --> 25:31.654
What?

25:31.697 --> 25:33.113
Face the wall.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.574
I'm leaving, and I don't
want you looking at me.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.350
Judge Rowe.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.686
Want some company?

27:27.730 --> 27:29.897
Colonel,
do I need to remind you

27:29.940 --> 27:31.815
that we're not supposed to
talk to one another

27:31.859 --> 27:33.692
without opposing counsel
present?

27:33.736 --> 27:36.987
You're a guest
in McCullough Springs.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.864
I'm not allowed to be
hospitable?

27:38.908 --> 27:40.032
Cigar?

27:40.076 --> 27:41.200
No, thank you.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.785
Hmm.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.330
Now, your father,
if I'm not mistaken,

27:46.374 --> 27:48.415
was Gordon Rowe,
the Texas Ranger.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.042
He was.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.211
Did you ever meet him?

27:52.254 --> 27:55.631
Yeah,
he was before my time.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.258
But I understood
he was a good man,

27:58.302 --> 28:00.052
a Godly man.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.596
That's very good
to hear.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.682
My pleasure.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.976
You know,
your family is, uh,

28:08.020 --> 28:11.647
part of the fabric
of this state.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.440
There's not
too many of us left.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.236
Colonel, I...

28:17.279 --> 28:18.570
I should be going.

28:18.614 --> 28:23.367
Well, just a moment.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.285
The real plaintiff
in this case

28:25.329 --> 28:27.246
is not Maria Garcia,

28:27.289 --> 28:31.875
but Roy Endicott
and Standard of Pennsylvania.

28:34.255 --> 28:37.256
Their purpose
is not to even win,

28:37.299 --> 28:39.717
but to force me to sell.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.430
Now,
you're an experienced man.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.224
You know how dirty
this business can be.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.560
Yes, I do.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.603
I do, Mr. McCullough.

28:51.647 --> 28:54.440
I've watched my whole life
as men like you

28:54.483 --> 28:58.944
have used tax foreclosures,
sheriff sales,

28:58.988 --> 29:02.614
fraud, intimidation,
and worse

29:02.658 --> 29:05.826
to take
your neighbors' land.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.788
Now, Miss Garcia
may prove her case

29:09.832 --> 29:12.624
or she may not.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.210
But I will not be
your instrument, sir.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.008
And if you contact me
again,

29:21.051 --> 29:23.427
I'll hold you
in contempt.

29:26.307 --> 29:31.101
Maria Garcia has effectively
put our balls in a vice!

29:31.145 --> 29:33.312
And there's a not a Goddamn
thing we can do about it.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.482
We can't drill,
and we can't move what we have.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.318
If we're not generating revenue
with the oil we got,

29:39.361 --> 29:41.862
we can't afford to put test
wells on those ranchers' land.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.322
Can we bluff,
scrape together enough

29:43.365 --> 29:44.365
to put up one rig?

29:44.408 --> 29:46.074
That would help.
No.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.328
Not without getting the oil
in those tanks to market.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.579
Ranchers
get wind of this,

29:50.623 --> 29:51.683
they're either
gonna go with Monahan

29:51.707 --> 29:52.831
or string us up.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.167
Yeah, probably both.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.085
Standard's been gunning
for a monopoly.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.545
This is how
they're gonna do it.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.842
No.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.427
I don't care about
that injunction.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.014
I made a promise
to those ranchers.

30:09.058 --> 30:11.433
I'm not about to let Standard
make a liar out of me.

30:15.773 --> 30:19.525
We move that oil...
Tonight.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.819
Law doesn't need to know.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.906
Well, shit.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.367
I could not be
more proud.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.956
All right, now push.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.002
Right there. Again!

30:39.046 --> 30:40.420
Charles, grab it!

30:44.093 --> 30:47.010
Whoo!

30:47.054 --> 30:48.846
...Careful!

30:48.889 --> 30:50.472
Pete, they're tired.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.811
We gotta get it
to the train before sun-up.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.480
Well, someone's gonna get hurt
if you keep pushing.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.569
20 bucks to the team
who loads their truck first.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.446
- Let's get it, boys!
- Let's go!

31:13.247 --> 31:14.913
Boss?

31:14.957 --> 31:16.248
We got company.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.671
Who the hell is this?

31:22.715 --> 31:24.715
Looks like
the law and order league.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.610
Evening, Pete.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.904
Niles.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.366
Huh.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.911
Now as I recollect,

31:53.954 --> 31:55.787
ownership of this land

31:55.831 --> 31:58.040
has been questioned
in a court of law.

31:58.083 --> 32:02.377
And the widow Garcia
has hired me

32:02.421 --> 32:04.171
to make sure
that you McCulloughs

32:04.214 --> 32:08.342
do not attempt to move her oil
off her properties.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.470
The law is with me.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.474
Monahan's using you.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.934
It is a fortunate man

32:16.977 --> 32:19.770
who takes gratification
in his work,

32:19.813 --> 32:21.897
and I am...

32:23.400 --> 32:25.776
I'm damn proud
to be stopping you

32:25.819 --> 32:29.029
from profiting on oil
that ain't rightly yours.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.827
You gave me a fright,
Gus.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.538
I couldn't
make you out there.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.791
Make me out now.

32:40.834 --> 32:44.252
This is what
the McCullough ascendency

32:44.296 --> 32:46.380
looks like, gentlemen.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.423
It's dark.

32:50.844 --> 32:55.555
Your people are no friend
to the workin' man, Pete.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.767
Hiring mongrels...

32:58.811 --> 33:00.310
turning your back

33:00.354 --> 33:05.315
on the many qualified
white men in need.

33:05.359 --> 33:09.194
Sons spoiled and hairless

33:09.238 --> 33:11.822
without the tiniest idea

33:11.865 --> 33:15.409
of what the world
is really like.

33:15.452 --> 33:16.868
You want to see
the next world?

33:24.169 --> 33:28.505
Hmm.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.757
Take your goons and go,
Niles.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.178
Whoo, whoo!

33:37.599 --> 33:40.475
He just
called you all goons.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.901
God dog.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.779
The McCulloughs have been
making a habit, lately,

33:52.823 --> 33:56.158
of pushing away
the white men of this town.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.327
But they seem
to have forgotten

33:59.371 --> 34:02.080
one very important
thing.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.460
White men push back.

34:07.963 --> 34:12.049
Now, you take that oil...

34:12.092 --> 34:14.092
back where it belongs...

34:16.554 --> 34:18.638
...before I have my goons

34:18.681 --> 34:21.600
set your damn truck
on fire.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.620
You heard him boys.

34:41.663 --> 34:42.871
Let's go.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.548
The search party
is still out there.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.258
I know.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.677
What if they find the body?
They won't.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.303
They can find anything,
Eli.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.430
I covered our tracks. Well,
maybe not good enough.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.307
The spot where we killed him...
You killed him.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.911
There's still blood there.
I covered it.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.770
I should go there.
Why?

35:48.814 --> 35:50.605
So you can take his scalp?

35:52.568 --> 35:54.401
Don't be mean, Eli.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.736
I have no other friends
here.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.284
Just don't leave camp.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.535
Please.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.794
You and Prairie Flower
are lucky.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.298
You protect each other.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.593
You don't know
what it's like for me.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.221
You're starting
to look guilty.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.931
That's how
they'll catch you.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.669
Whoa, what, what?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.838
I just dreamt something.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.591
Oh, go back to sleep.

36:59.635 --> 37:02.677
I dreamt of Scalped-A-Dog.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.597
I saw everything.

37:07.142 --> 37:11.228
The water was coming
closer and closer.

37:11.271 --> 37:15.273
And it ripped at his belly
and tore out his heart.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.652
And when the water left,
his eyes were still there,

37:18.695 --> 37:22.155
staring up at nothing
forever.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.619
I think it means

37:27.663 --> 37:30.538
the white men from the fort
killed him.

37:39.132 --> 37:41.341
Maybe it was just
a dream.

37:41.385 --> 37:46.137
Dreams sometimes
tell us truth...

37:46.181 --> 37:48.056
and show us things

37:48.100 --> 37:50.016
we cannot see
any other way.

37:52.521 --> 37:56.022
Right now...

37:58.694 --> 38:01.111
...have little drops
on them.

38:01.154 --> 38:04.990
Dried blood, I think.

38:05.033 --> 38:08.618
I noticed them the night
you first came to my tipi,

38:08.662 --> 38:11.204
the night Scalped-A-Dog
disappeared.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.662
Injunctions...

38:52.706 --> 38:56.833
it's like a snake bite.

38:56.877 --> 39:00.337
It's gonna hurt more and more
till it kills us.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.174
And it will kill us.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.760
I should have
seen this coming.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.345
Well,
you can't blame yourself

39:08.388 --> 39:09.971
for not having
a crystal ball.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.683
That woman's gonna be
the ruin of me.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.486
Listen...

39:24.529 --> 39:27.447
the injunction
only stays in place...

39:27.491 --> 39:29.115
if there's a plaintiff.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.412
If she goes away,
so does our problem.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.123
Absolutely not.
It solves everything.

39:37.167 --> 39:39.209
Everyone's gonna know
who did it and why.

39:39.252 --> 39:40.752
Once Kilborne's back,
it won't matter.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.421
The law
is not my concern.

39:44.508 --> 39:48.093
You hurt her,
we lose Pete forever.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.887
I'm giving you a way out of this.
No.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.264
The town doesn't miss
her family.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.059
They won't miss her.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.770
But you can't do
what needs to be done

39:58.814 --> 40:01.147
because you don't trust Pete
to stay in the fold.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.234
Son! Pete is not himself
when she's around.

40:04.277 --> 40:08.655
And if we expect him to lead,
she's gotta be gone.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.660
You're coddling him.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.538
This is what's gonna
cost us everything.

40:21.837 --> 40:23.753
Turn off the lights
when you leave.

40:58.623 --> 41:03.168
Turn around,
Mr. McCullough.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.462
I need to see
Miss Garcia.

41:05.505 --> 41:08.214
Don't think
that you do.

41:08.258 --> 41:10.049
Tell her
Pete McCullough's here.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.930
Fine.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.475
What do you want?

41:23.148 --> 41:25.815
I want you...

41:25.859 --> 41:27.192
to leave.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.811
Drive.
