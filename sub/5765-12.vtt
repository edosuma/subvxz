00:01.360 --> 00:03.260
Previously on The Good Wife:
Zach, you're 14 years old.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.427
You are a freshman in high
school. You had a junior

00:05.470 --> 00:08.132
in your room yesterday
with the door closed.

00:08.170 --> 00:09.432
The computer stays here.

00:09.470 --> 00:10.698
You know those envelopes
on your doorstep--

00:10.740 --> 00:12.298
they're just the beginning.
I have a lot more.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.671
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.575
ZACH:
Somebody's trying
to set up Dad.

00:15.610 --> 00:16.645
GRACE:
Zach, this is serious.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.307
ALICIA:
Did anything come for me

00:18.350 --> 00:19.510
at the apartment
that I didn't get?

00:19.550 --> 00:20.744
Like what?

00:20.780 --> 00:21.769
I don't know.
A package or something?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.742
GRACE:
Is this fake, too?

00:23.790 --> 00:25.143
I don't know.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.249
Last year,
Glenn wiretapped your phones.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.450
What?

00:28.490 --> 00:30.651
I saw the recordings
on his computer.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.798
I said I might come over.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.468
I thought you said...

00:36.500 --> 00:38.297
Well, Laya wants to go
to the Riviera

00:38.330 --> 00:41.128
to see The Prairie Cartel.

00:41.170 --> 00:45.061
Is that a stuffed elephant
behind you there, Zachary?

00:46.140 --> 00:48.108
Well, that is adorable.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.301
I had no idea that you collected
stuffed animals.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.079
I'm in my sister's room.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.076
Oh, bro-sis bonding night.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.473
That's very sweet.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.613
My mom moved my computer
into the living room.

00:57.650 --> 00:59.311
GRACE:
It's been 20 minutes already.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.214
Just... five more.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.228
You're not even supposed
to be on my computer.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.420
So use mine.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.395
Mom's out there.

01:07.430 --> 01:08.499
I have spent the last year
nannying full time,

01:08.530 --> 01:12.091
but with grad school,
I can really only do part time.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.732
And you're at
Northwestern?
Yes.

01:13.770 --> 01:17.262
A dual master's in Business
and Educational Psychology.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.279
I'm really interested
in child development.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.575
Uh, have you heard
of the EMT?

01:23.610 --> 01:25.771
The Educational
Measurement Test.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.448
My father created it.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.243
Oh.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.587
GRACE:
You're not even supposed
to be talking to anybody.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.383
ZACH:
Why do you care?

01:32.420 --> 01:34.456
Because it's my computer.
If you're not
gonna be using it,

01:34.490 --> 01:35.411
then really, who cares?
It's mine!

01:35.460 --> 01:37.621
I'm from a big family.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.890
Six brothers and sisters.
ZACH: Who cares?

01:39.930 --> 01:40.828
Just use mine.
Mom's out there.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.896
Who cares?
I care.
All my stuff's in here.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.263
Aanay, um, part time
is perfect for us.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.734
I'm just looking for someone
who can cover the hours

01:48.770 --> 01:50.431
that my mother-in-law
can't be here.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.131
So, this would be afternoons?

01:52.180 --> 01:53.579
Evenings?
JACKIE:
I said stop arguing

01:53.610 --> 01:54.770
about the computer.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.209
You're making
so much noise,
Yes.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.342
your mother
can't hear a thing.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.678
Uh, I was hoping that someone
could start next week.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.574
So, I will call
your references,

02:01.620 --> 02:02.814
and we'll be in touch.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.408
(arguing continues)
Good.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.179
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.517
Bye.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.825
(phone rings, arguing continues)

02:10.860 --> 02:12.521
Hello?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.425
Alicia. Hi, sorry.
It's Will.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.654
I know you just got home,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.691
but I just got a call
from Memorial North.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.891
The hospital?
Yeah. We signed them
a month ago.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.737
You have your own
in the other room.
Would you both stop arguing

02:21.770 --> 02:23.738
about the computer?!
This is ridiculous.
Exactly.
So tell Grace...

02:23.770 --> 02:25.738
The administrator called.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.909
Seems like they got a bit
of a fluid situation over there

02:27.940 --> 02:29.305
involving a possible
malpractice suit.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.772
A possible one?

02:30.810 --> 02:32.573
Yes. I think
they're being overcautious,

02:32.620 --> 02:33.416
but they just came off

02:33.450 --> 02:35.441
a million-dollar
malpractice payout,

02:35.480 --> 02:36.788
so we jump through hoops.

02:36.820 --> 02:40.210
They got a call ten minutes ago
from a paramedic

02:40.260 --> 02:41.454
coming in with a heater.

02:41.490 --> 02:42.559
A heater?

02:42.590 --> 02:44.558
A high-profile patient.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.525
I don't have all the details,
but it sounds like an OD to me.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.652
I need someone
to get over there,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.395
make sure if this _does _
turn Into a malpractice swt,

02:50.430 --> 02:51.590
we got our ducks in a row.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.699
Okay?

02:52.740 --> 02:56.528
Look, I know we've been
asking a lot of you lately.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.937
So, if you want me to put this
on Cary, I can.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.244
No. I've got it.

03:03.910 --> 03:05.901
(indistinct chattering)

03:12.520 --> 03:13.851
Thank God.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.414
I thought he was
sending out Cary.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.519
What's going on?
Ben Bowers,

03:17.560 --> 03:18.686
Gables High
star quarterback,

03:18.730 --> 03:21.597
USU recruit,
collapsed on the field.
How's he doing?

03:21.630 --> 03:23.325
I think we're going
to find out now.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.639
DOCTOR:
Mrs. Bowers...

03:27.670 --> 03:29.331
(talking quietly)

03:29.370 --> 03:32.498
(Mrs. Bowers crying)

03:32.540 --> 03:35.668
(sobbing)

03:35.710 --> 03:37.701
Time to go to work.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.883
(sobbing continues)
I'm so sorry...

03:46.760 --> 03:49.820
Get corporate compliance,
HR, PR.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.828
No, I have outside counsel.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.658
Um, code was
called at 8:35.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.565
In-house called police.
(snaps fingers)

03:56.600 --> 03:59.694
8:45. They're
on their way.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.436
(camera snaps)

04:14.320 --> 04:16.311
(camera snaps)

04:19.420 --> 04:20.751
One shoe?

04:20.790 --> 04:22.758
(camera snapping)

04:22.790 --> 04:24.326
Where's the other shoe?

04:25.630 --> 04:27.325
Police are five minutes away.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.918
Is that his bag?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.326
Uh, the paramedics
brought it in.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.659
"Dr. Wesley."

04:34.700 --> 04:36.531
Is that the attending
physician?

04:36.570 --> 04:37.662
Yes.
Is he on staff?

04:38.810 --> 04:39.936
MAN:
Yeah.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.936
Uh-oh.

04:41.980 --> 04:43.402
What?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.304
80 milligrams.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.942
Where's your doctor?

04:46.980 --> 04:48.345
Wesley?

04:48.380 --> 04:49.381
I'll locate him. Why?

04:49.420 --> 04:52.958
You got 80 milligrams owcodone
in a 17-year-old.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.651
If you want to know
when this went south,

04:54.690 --> 04:55.850
this just went south.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.323
Cops are two minutes away.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.521
They take a half hour
to call in detectives.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.358
Another half hour
to find these pills.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.766
Doctor's got about 90 minutes
before he gets arrested.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.030
I have to get the board
together.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.731
First, get to your doctor

05:08.770 --> 05:10.863
and make sure
he exercises his Miranda.
I'll go with.

05:14.910 --> 05:16.775
(chuckling):
Ah. Kalinda.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.368
Somehow I should've expected it.

05:18.410 --> 05:19.547
Murphy.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.639
Got here fast.
Mmm, it's a heater on
a Friday night.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.578
What do you expect?

05:22.620 --> 05:25.487
So you been documenting
the scene?
Yep.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.953
Yeah? Don't suppose
you want to

05:26.990 --> 05:28.753
focus my eyes on the
salient details?

05:28.790 --> 05:30.758
Now where's the fun in that?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.597
Damn.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.765
Is that Dr. Wesley?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.028
WESLEY:
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Bowers.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.765
I'm just so sorry.
He was only 17.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.778
How... how does
this...?

05:46.810 --> 05:48.437
I don't know.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.799
I want to see him.
I understand.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.839
Dr. Wesley.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.644
May I speak to you
for a moment?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.749
Please.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.781
Do I know you?
I'm Alicia.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.856
I'm a lawyer with Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.694
You can't be talking
with the mother right now.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.357
Why not?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.169
Your patient overdosed

06:12.200 --> 06:14.691
from pills you prescribed.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.731
And there is some question
about the dosage.

06:16.770 --> 06:19.000
Even a simple expression
of sympathy

06:19.040 --> 06:21.736
could be construed
as an admissmn of gurlt.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.407
Then it's an admission.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.042
That's my patient.
I'm their family doctor.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.071
And I'm your lawyer.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.612
If I was sick right now, I would
do exactly as you told me to do.

06:30.650 --> 06:32.789
But you're in trouble.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.708
And I need you to do
exactly as I tell you.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.909
I-I'm in trouble?
The police think...?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.188
Please.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.754
Where's your office?
The south tower.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.758
I want you to go there.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.461
Don't speak to anyone.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.694
I know this is going
to be difficult,

06:43.730 --> 06:44.867
but promise me, please...

06:44.900 --> 06:47.095
I'd never put Ben in harm's way.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.859
If you're my attorney,
I want you to know that.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.898
This is going to be huge,
isn't it?

06:52.940 --> 06:54.430
The press, people...

06:54.480 --> 06:56.129
Block it out.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.875
Alicia, right?

07:00.920 --> 07:01.978
Yes.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.647
I'm Shawn.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.782
We'll speak soon.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.831
(text message alert beeps)

07:28.880 --> 07:30.575
He's a Florrick kid.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.612
You got to give him a minute.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.723
Hey.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.785
You sure you're going to be
warm enough there, Zachary?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.798
This is Laya.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.798
Hey.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.798
(Grace screams)

07:50.830 --> 07:53.560
GRACE:
Zach! Zach! Come here, Zach!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.636
Zach!

07:55.670 --> 07:57.262
(panﬁng)

07:57.310 --> 07:58.663
Oh...

08:03.950 --> 08:07.943
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

08:20.300 --> 08:22.723
She had a stroke.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.795
She's still unconscious,
but stable.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.796
Which hospital?

08:28.840 --> 08:29.636
Harbor.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.558
The kids couldn't
get through to 911,

08:31.610 --> 08:32.736
so Becca drove them there.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.031
Becca?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.570
She's Zach's friend.

08:35.610 --> 08:36.872
It's a long story.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.811
She-she drove, so she's...

08:39.850 --> 08:41.818
She's 16.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.648
Zach was sneaking out
to go to a concert.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.941
I already talked to him.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.049
I need to get out of here.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.821
Okay.

08:53.860 --> 08:57.318
Look, there's an excellent
neurologist,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.019
his name is Dr. Hester,

08:59.070 --> 09:00.731
and he's at St.
Michael's.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.237
You need to get him
over to Harbor

09:02.270 --> 09:04.306
to evaluate her.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.308
He's going to tell you
that he's busy,

09:06.340 --> 09:09.798
but you just say to him that
I'd greatly appreciate it.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.205
I phoned your sister.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.808
I bet that went well.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.613
She wants updates.

09:16.650 --> 09:18.641
(sighs)

09:20.660 --> 09:22.924
I'm going to have Golden apply
for a sick bed visit.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.724
We're going to need a
critically ill notification

09:25.760 --> 09:26.920
from the attending
physician.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.669
And unfortunately,

09:30.700 --> 09:33.692
we bear the cost_of
a superwsed VlSlt.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.664
Could be... a
couple thousand.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.632
You need to see her.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.602
Thank you.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.879
How are you?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.888
I'm...

09:51.920 --> 09:53.251
It's been a busy 48 hours.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.179
I found someone
to fill in at home.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.858
She had good references.

09:57.890 --> 10:01.348
And, um, I'm going to take over
Jackie's power of attorney,

10:01.400 --> 10:02.719
for the time being.
Of course.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.260
So I just need you to sign...

10:11.340 --> 10:14.207
And just, uh,
initial the next page.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.908
Thank you.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.773
You're welcome.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.778
WESLEY:
This is just odd.

10:48.810 --> 10:51.677
I started the day with one
lawyer, and now I have ten.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.871
Yo_ur issues
are our Issues, Shawn.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.741
Thank you for
posting my bail.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.348
For standing by me.
Of course.

10:58.390 --> 10:59.789
We want to see you cleared.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.959
Now, due to the popularity
of the victim...

11:01.990 --> 11:03.685
Ben.
Yes, Ben.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.686
We believe the state's
attorney's office

11:05.730 --> 11:06.924
is guilty
of legal overreach.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.427
They have charged
you with murder,

11:08.460 --> 11:10.826
which is a sign
of their desperation.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.861
It's a charge
aimed at headlines.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.367
Isn't that bad?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.765
Hi.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.002
No, it probably means

11:18.040 --> 11:19.837
they don't intend
to bring it to trial.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.098
They just want to get a plea
bargain with some jail time.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.142
Any jail time.
Which we won't accept.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.398
WILL: Right. We just need to
make them aware of the facts.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.941
And they are: you prescribed
the ten-milligram

11:28.980 --> 11:30.948
painkillers,
but not the 80-milligram.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.810
That's right.
Good.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.816
So we just need to find where
these other drugs came from.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.725
Our team will
do some digging,

11:36.760 --> 11:38.853
cut this off
before it goes to trial.

11:41.930 --> 11:42.919
(laughs):
No way.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.926
You cannot be here.
HI, Murphy.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.369
Yeah, how did you even get in?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.368
Hi, Li.
Kalinda. We miss you.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.833
What's that,
stomach contents?

11:49.870 --> 11:50.905
Don't answer her.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.771
Looks like you ran
into the one cop

11:52.810 --> 11:54.402
who can resist your charms,
Kalinda.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.409
Tell him about my sweet
personality, Li.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.977
Blueberries and
sesame seeds.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.045
Flax seeds and bananas.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.284
Li, what did I just say?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.912
So...

12:05.950 --> 12:07.918
what's your take on the
Florrick appeal?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.780
I just keep my
head down,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.354
someone ends up
signing the checks.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.927
In a street fight,
my money's on Florrick.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.949
LI:
Same here.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.968
So, was it the owcodone, Li?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.025
And alprazolam, ephedra.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.038
Kid's got a pharmacy
in his stomach.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.799
Li, shut up.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.808
See how easy that was?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.068
Take care.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.121
What are you doing here?

12:48.160 --> 12:49.866
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Bowers.

12:49.900 --> 12:50.969
I'm... I'm just trying

12:51.000 --> 12:52.888
to piece together
what happened.
No, you're not.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.795
You're trying to protect
the doctor who killed my son.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.102
Thank you.

12:57.140 --> 13:00.029
I know your first instinct would
be to slam the door in my face,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.002
buthu".

13:09.080 --> 13:11.082
He was a good boy.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.418
You should be trying
to fight for him.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.087
I just want to know the truth.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.155
No, you don't.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.384
You're a lavwer.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.928
Everyone's painting my son
as some kind of drug addict.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.962
And everyone's painting
Dr. Wesley

13:24.000 --> 13:25.991
as some kind of pill pusher.
So help me.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.964
Help me figure out

13:28.000 --> 13:31.037
how Ben got those drugs
in his system.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.300
MRS. BOWERS:
I'm not sure

13:33.340 --> 13:35.103
what you want to hear.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.142
My son didn't hang around
with drug dealers.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.944
I know, but maybe
a friend,

13:39.980 --> 13:41.413
or the football
coach”.
No.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.281
I knew all the people
in his life.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.459
Kids aren't always forthcoming.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.421
Ben didn't really have the time.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.553
I mean, he was either at school

13:55.600 --> 13:57.124
or-or-or practice
or the gym.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.126
I mean,
that was his life.

13:59.170 --> 14:00.967
Maybe it was too much.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.900
I don't know.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.100
I'm a single mom.

14:04.140 --> 14:07.007
You know, you can't...
see everything.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.873
You can't...

14:09.910 --> 14:11.104
be there all the time.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.311
When they fall...

14:13.350 --> 14:16.979
I was reading a story

14:17.020 --> 14:19.989
by one of the moms
of the Columbine killer.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.988
And I thought to myself,

14:22.020 --> 14:23.624
"Oh, my God.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.857
I understand."

14:30.670 --> 14:32.524
Molly. Everything okay?

14:32.570 --> 14:33.969
Doing great.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.137
Grace is in her room,

14:35.170 --> 14:37.468
and, um, Zach's friend
Becca is here.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.137
Really?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.376
Where are they?

14:40.410 --> 14:42.105
Well, actually, um,

14:42.140 --> 14:44.074
I asked them to stay
in the living room,

14:44.110 --> 14:46.044
if you don't mind. I just felt
more comfortable with that.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.014
Yes. Thank you.

14:48.050 --> 14:51.019
Oh, and Mrs. Florrick
is there anything you don't eat?

14:51.050 --> 14:52.119
Because I'm making

14:52.150 --> 14:55.449
a lasagna, but I can make it
meatless if you want.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.481
No, anything's fine,
Molly. Thanks.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.054
Okay.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.058
I was just checking in.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.994
but where did the alprazolam
and ephedra come from?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.429
Is that the stomach contents?

15:07.470 --> 15:09.062
Mm-hmm, and his last meal.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.102
Flax seeds, blueberries
and bananas.

15:11.140 --> 15:14.303
What's the history on the
hospital parking ER patients?

15:14.340 --> 15:16.103
What do you mean?

15:16.140 --> 15:16.879
You know, making them wait.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.673
No, I know what
"parking" means,

15:18.710 --> 15:19.745
but what do you mean?

15:19.780 --> 15:22.442
The missing shoe.
I found it in an empty ER ward.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.313
I was wondering
if they had parked him.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.352
You do know the hospital
is our client.

15:27.390 --> 15:29.051
Yes.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.284
But if they're vulnerable...

15:30.330 --> 15:31.558
Then we deal with that.

15:31.590 --> 15:33.091
What did you get
from his mom?

15:35.130 --> 15:36.324
Not much.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.090
Ben didn't do much more
than study, work out.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.165
What gym?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.498
Um, Iron Muscle. Why?

15:42.540 --> 15:44.508
Flax seeds and bananas.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.337
Sounds like a power smoothie.

15:46.370 --> 15:50.204
Yeah, gym's a good place
to score some ephedra.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.610
I read an article.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.512
(exhaHng)

16:13.500 --> 16:15.388
(low, indistinct conversation)

16:37.660 --> 16:40.220
Something you
can't do yourself?

16:40.260 --> 16:42.228
Poor little me.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.727
I need a man.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.726
She wanted to get engaged

16:45.770 --> 16:47.738
right out of law school.

16:47.770 --> 16:50.204
Her dad's Patrick J. Brown.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.605
You know who that is?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.073
No.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.135
Eh, well, he's Fortune 500,
semiconductors.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.148
But I said no.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.444
I mean, 26 and married.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.448
Cary, you know I'm
not listening

17:01.480 --> 17:03.345
to a word you're
saying, right?

17:07.820 --> 17:09.788
Here, let me
spot you.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.527
Are you seeing
someone?

17:12.560 --> 17:14.255
Okay, when they go
into the locker room,

17:14.300 --> 17:15.289
don't approach them.

17:15.330 --> 17:16.558
Just watch the exchange

17:16.600 --> 17:18.227
and I'll make
the approach later.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.498
I'm sorry,
did you hear my question?

17:19.530 --> 17:22.499
Do you have a
boyfriend?

17:22.540 --> 17:23.802
Do I have a boyfriend?
Yeah.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.035
No.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.515
I have the stuff
you were asking about.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.744
That's all of it?

17:35.780 --> 17:38.044
It looks different.
New mix. You'll love it.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.754
All right.
Looks good.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.758
Later.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.350
Hey, let's say I
want to bulk up.

17:46.390 --> 17:47.652
What?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.656
Let's say I want to bulk
up, I want to pay for it.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.668
You got anything for me?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.691
Sure.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.574
First one's free.

18:02.610 --> 18:03.372
What's this?

18:03.410 --> 18:07.449
_It's homemade
acaI berry supplement.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.640
(chuckles)

18:08.680 --> 18:10.841
I don't sell drugs.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.381
All right.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.411
Well, if you think of
somebody who does,

18:15.460 --> 18:16.688
here's my number.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.150
Thanks, man.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.395
Yeah.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.360
(door closes)

18:31.410 --> 18:33.378
A wiretap?
Right.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.401
How reliable is
your source?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.408
Reliable. It's Alicia.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.678
(sighs)

18:38.710 --> 18:40.678
Childs' ex-wife told her.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.689
All right, um...

18:43.720 --> 18:44.846
assuming that it's true,

18:44.890 --> 18:47.654
and I file a motion to compel
production of the taps,

18:47.690 --> 18:48.884
whatever is on
those taps

18:48.920 --> 18:50.888
will come out.
Right.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.886
Mm-mm, the good
and the bad.

18:52.930 --> 18:55.353
I mean, if there is
anything on those tapes,

18:55.400 --> 18:57.391
that _will work
against us...

19:00.640 --> 19:03.234
Well...

19:03.270 --> 19:04.567
that's a lot to consider.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.168
ALICIA:
And if you could just

19:06.210 --> 19:07.609
help me with
your handwriting here.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.403
Yeah, sorry, wretched
penmanship's

19:09.440 --> 19:11.203
a job requirement.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.241
Uh, patellar.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.748
Uh, analgesic.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.645
Thank you, Alicia.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.453
For?

19:20.490 --> 19:21.582
For keeping this
from feeling

19:21.620 --> 19:22.917
like it's spinning
out of control.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.896
You said you saw Ben
before he went to school.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.921
That's when you prescribed
the oxycodone?

19:31.970 --> 19:32.959
Yes.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.865
But... your shift
didn't start

19:34.900 --> 19:35.889
until 10:00 that morning.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.908
Oh. Right.

19:37.940 --> 19:40.602
I saw him at home before
I went to work.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.631
He had an appointment
scheduled for noon

19:42.680 --> 19:44.671
but didn't want
to miss class.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.512
Give me a minute.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.189
(clears throat)

20:11.670 --> 20:13.331
Diane?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.735
He prescribed
prescription narcotics

20:15.780 --> 20:17.873
to a teenager out of his house.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.413
And then went into work
and updated Ben's chart

20:20.450 --> 20:21.678
as though there
were an official

20:21.720 --> 20:22.812
hospital visit at noon.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.442
He said he would've prescribed

20:24.490 --> 20:26.310
the exact same thing
out of the ofﬁce.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.609
It's a game-changer.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.483
As far as I'm concerned.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.588
Good job.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.621
Thanks for discovering it.

20:36.730 --> 20:37.890
So, you want
to walk away?

20:37.930 --> 20:39.363
The prosecution

20:39.400 --> 20:42.437
can argue there was
no valid doctor's visit.

20:42.470 --> 20:44.529
There's a falsified
medical record.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.602
So, do you want to walk away?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.835
I think it's the smart
thing to do.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.315
Please let Dr. Wesley know

20:58.350 --> 21:00.580
the hospital can no longer
be involved in his defense.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.931
(train passing nearby)

21:25.850 --> 21:27.875
(music playing)

21:29.380 --> 21:31.985
Sorry to hear about
your divorce.
Thank you.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.487
I was being sarcastic.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.657
I want your help.

21:35.690 --> 21:38.420
With?
The Florrick appeal.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.882
Prior knowledge to evidence
he's bringing,

21:39.930 --> 21:41.727
where and how he's getting
it, from whom...

21:41.760 --> 21:43.398
How many investigators
do you have

21:43.430 --> 21:44.897
at the state's attorney's
office, Glenn?

21:44.930 --> 21:46.921
You have special knowledge
from working with him directly.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.666
That was a long time ago.

21:49.700 --> 21:50.962
I have a different job now.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.478
You can work two.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.801
How much?

21:56.840 --> 21:58.102
No money.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.879
I don't think you
understand

21:59.910 --> 22:01.912
how exposed you are
from your past work

22:01.950 --> 22:03.076
with the state's
attorney's office.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.338
Subpoenas stopped
at Florrick

22:05.390 --> 22:07.608
only because I wanted them
stopped at Florrick.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.389
You're trying to tie me
to his scandal.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.920
You are tied to his scandal.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.428
I am offering to
keep the record

22:14.460 --> 22:17.099
sealed if you give me
what I want, that's all.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.409
(train passing nearby)

22:28.010 --> 22:29.739
I'm so sorry.

22:31.110 --> 22:33.772
What happened to my issues
being the hospital's?

22:33.820 --> 22:35.811
I don't think
I can answer that.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.550
So I prescribe from home.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.023
It was a minor infraction.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.925
It_ wasn't
anything unusual.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.723
If a patient needs help,

22:49.760 --> 22:51.967
I give it regardless of where...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.934
It's a relief for
them, isn't it?

22:55.970 --> 22:58.939
The hospital
isn't liable anymore, I am.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.808
I can't really afford you
without the hospital's support,

23:09.850 --> 23:12.648
but I could... pay
you in installments.

23:12.690 --> 23:13.987
You want me to continue?

23:14.020 --> 23:15.954
I could end up with a
public defender who...

23:17.930 --> 23:19.750
I'd rather stick with you.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.894
But the hospital dumped you
because of me.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.591
So make it up to me.

23:23.630 --> 23:26.098
WILL:
Dr. Wesley knows
you're the one

23:26.130 --> 23:27.768
who brought this to us?

23:27.800 --> 23:30.906
Yes. If North Memorial
waives conflict...

23:30.940 --> 23:31.929
That's a big "if."

23:31.970 --> 23:34.837
It's still best for them
if Dr. Wesley is cleared,

23:34.880 --> 23:36.677
especially if
they're vulnerable

23:36.710 --> 23:37.745
on other questions.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.441
Hmm...

23:39.480 --> 23:40.811
On his own dime?

23:42.150 --> 23:44.914
But it'll just be you.
We've already reassigned

23:44.950 --> 23:46.918
Kalinda and Cary.
Okay.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.953
(The Twilight Zone
ringtone playing)

23:51.060 --> 23:52.925
Jackie?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.599
You look good.

23:55.630 --> 23:59.464
Well, I'm just trying
to get some life back in me.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.730
(chuckles)
What?

24:01.770 --> 24:03.169
What did I do now?

24:03.200 --> 24:06.761
Whenever you're
given a compliment,

24:06.810 --> 24:07.936
you take it
as criticism.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.004
No, I don't.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.809
Aanay, thank you
for phoning me.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.977
Well, I-I just... I...

24:16.920 --> 24:18.911
You're welcome.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.850
So, uh...

24:20.890 --> 24:23.154
you hired this girl Molly

24:23.190 --> 24:25.021
to watch Grace and Zach.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.028
(sighs)
Yes, I did.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.722
I don't like her.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.489
Really?

24:31.530 --> 24:32.963
I know that look.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.037
You think I don't like her
because she's taking my place.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.935
Yes, I do.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.632
She's pushy.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.033
She's-she's

24:42.080 --> 24:44.571
a know-it-all.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.044
Peter's going to try and
get out to come see you.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.913
You trying
to make me feel good?

24:49.950 --> 24:51.588
Yes, I am, but it's true.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.589
Take these with a full glass
of water, Mrs. Florrick.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.088
What are these orange ones?

24:58.130 --> 25:00.018
Five milligrams warfarin.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.152
How can you be sure?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.156
A practiced eye.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.269
Not to worry.

25:10.670 --> 25:11.807
Dropping off or picking up?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.673
Actually, I was wondering
if you could help me, Jill.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.598
My mother-in-law
is very nervous

25:16.640 --> 25:17.902
about taking her pills,

25:17.950 --> 25:20.839
and I need to explain how pills
are prescribed and dispensed.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.814
Do you mind?

25:22.850 --> 25:24.112
She's such a nuisance.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.141
Sure.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.026
* I was sleeping with you

25:37.060 --> 25:38.561
* You were sleeping with her

25:38.600 --> 25:40.568
* Is that why...

25:40.600 --> 25:42.966
So, aren't you
breaking the rules,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.160
having me in here?

25:46.310 --> 25:48.107
The door's open.

25:48.140 --> 25:51.007
* And I should be held
accountable *

25:51.050 --> 25:54.042
* But clarity

25:54.080 --> 25:58.585
* Isn't gonna save me...

25:58.620 --> 26:01.009
Aren't you breaking the rules,
having me in here?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.080
(chuckles)

26:21.110 --> 26:23.647
What do you want me to do?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.104
What do you want me
to do to you?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.838
Does she do this for you?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.950
* Ahh...

26:33.990 --> 26:34.979
Does she?

26:36.060 --> 26:37.857
It's...

26:37.890 --> 26:41.690
Your dad's sex tape?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.664
Say...

26:43.700 --> 26:45.691
"Just don't stop."

26:50.370 --> 26:52.235
(whispers):
Say it.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.033
Just don't stop.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.107
* Or you could be
kissing her instead *

26:59.150 --> 27:02.847
*

27:02.880 --> 27:05.087
* May be gone for good

27:05.120 --> 27:08.180
* And I should be held
accountable... *

27:08.220 --> 27:09.118
Molly?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.924
You know Zach and
Becca are in his room?

27:11.960 --> 27:14.690
They wanted to play some music,
so I said it was all right.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.925
I don't think
my mom wanted them to.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.190
It's okay.

27:19.230 --> 27:20.891
Zach just needs

27:20.940 --> 27:22.168
a little bit of, um,

27:22.200 --> 27:23.963
independence
and trust right now.

27:24.010 --> 27:27.059
I don't want
to infantilize him.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.078
Want to help me with dinner?

27:29.110 --> 27:31.146
Sure.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.711
It's all about tracking
and barcoding.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.411
When we take 20 pills
out of stock,

27:37.450 --> 27:39.941
we scan the prescription bottle
to log the pills,

27:39.990 --> 27:40.979
then scan the stock bottle.

27:41.020 --> 27:44.456
In theory, it all reconciles
at the end of the day.

27:44.490 --> 27:45.923
In theory?

27:45.960 --> 27:49.293
Well, not everyone
is diligent.

27:49.330 --> 27:51.093
Some think when we're busy,

27:51.130 --> 27:52.392
they can just
skip the barcoding.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.739
When the computer
reminds them,

27:54.770 --> 27:56.237
they just manually
override the warning.

27:56.270 --> 27:59.967
Is there any way
you could tell me

28:00.010 --> 28:02.137
if a certain prescription
has been barcoded?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.899
Was it filled here?

28:04.950 --> 28:06.178
You have the Rx number?

28:09.380 --> 28:11.985
My mother-in-law, she takes
pictures of all her pills.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.146
I know.

28:13.190 --> 28:15.385
It's a bit anal.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.752
B. Bowers.

28:17.790 --> 28:21.226
Four ten-milligram oxycodone.

28:23.530 --> 28:25.293
See?

28:25.330 --> 28:26.399
That's what
I'm talking about.

28:26.430 --> 28:27.761
Not barcoded.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.928
Terrible.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.200
I am plea bargaining.
Your doctor's dirty.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.275
There's nothing
linking...

28:34.310 --> 28:36.232
He prescribed
Ben Bowers oxycodone,

28:36.280 --> 28:38.168
and Ben Bowers died
of an oxycodone overdose.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.245
That's a link.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.770
And you have a task force

28:40.820 --> 28:42.242
looking into pill
pushers at local gyms,

28:42.280 --> 28:43.212
one of which...

28:43.250 --> 28:44.410
Is Peter holding up okay?

28:45.450 --> 28:47.509
Peter?

28:47.550 --> 28:50.110
Yes. How is he?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.855
I... he's fine.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.426
We have an associate

28:53.460 --> 28:55.098
looking into one of
these pill pushers

28:55.130 --> 28:56.449
at Ben's exact gym...

28:56.500 --> 28:58.127
I can do one year in jail.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.364
Suspended medical license.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.994
No.
I'm sorry?

29:02.040 --> 29:03.837
One year probation,
no jail time.

29:03.870 --> 29:07.306
Dr. Wesley prescribed
ten-milligram pills for Ben.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.137
And the pharmacy

29:09.180 --> 29:10.477
may have dispensed
incorrectly.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.398
May have? Really?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.179
Are we playing
"may haves"?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.871
Check with the pharmacy. They
didn't barcode the transaction.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.808
For all we know,
they gave him

29:18.850 --> 29:20.852
80-milligram
pills by mistake.

29:20.890 --> 29:22.118
That's reasonable doubt.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.221
Go ahead. Give them a call.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.490
I'll wait.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.363
So, here we are again.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.437
Yeah, here we are.

29:35.470 --> 29:38.803
You know, I've only been
fired once in my life.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.501
You still holding a grudge?

29:40.540 --> 29:44.203
Giving you a chance
to correct a mistake.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.502
(chuckles)
But my rates
have gone up.

29:46.550 --> 29:49.348
Well, what are
your qualifications?

29:49.380 --> 29:53.544
Childs asked me
to work for him.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.558
GOLDEN:
Um...

29:55.590 --> 29:57.353
To do what?

29:57.390 --> 30:01.099
Outbid him.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.098
(chuckles dryly)

30:05.370 --> 30:09.591
We have some funds, but, um...

30:09.640 --> 30:11.528
we'll need to know the nature

30:11.570 --> 30:14.334
of the information
you could supply.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.099
Childs tapped my home.

30:17.140 --> 30:20.576
We don't want to subpoena
those tapes

30:20.610 --> 30:22.339
unless we can preview them.

30:22.380 --> 30:23.574
Without him knowing?

30:23.620 --> 30:25.212
Mm-hmm.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.856
So, I think you should

30:28.890 --> 30:31.859
accept Childs' job offer.

30:31.890 --> 30:34.427
Work for him.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.996
And for us.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.327
That should be
a familiar feeling for you.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.828
I always did like you.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.413
(door closes)

30:56.450 --> 30:58.281
I think I'm in love.

31:03.090 --> 31:04.284
This doesn't feel like

31:04.330 --> 31:06.457
good news.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.094
When I gave you
the go-ahead

31:08.130 --> 31:09.950
to represent Dr. Wesley,
I thought you knew

31:10.000 --> 31:12.298
not to sacrifice a major client
for a minor one.

31:12.330 --> 31:15.094
I didn't... I didn't say
anything about the parking.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.596
Were you aware that
Middle Woods Pharmacy

31:16.640 --> 31:19.302
is owned in part
by Memorial North?

31:20.340 --> 31:22.001
No.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.678
You gave the ASA information

31:23.710 --> 31:26.599
suggesting the pharmacy
was at fault in Ben's death.

31:26.650 --> 31:29.471
I pointed out that
their inventory method

31:29.520 --> 31:31.488
left a gray area,
which is true.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.216
Well, true or not, the pharmacy
is now under investigation,

31:34.260 --> 31:35.488
and Memorial North
wasn't too happy

31:35.520 --> 31:37.920
to _have _their own firm
p0int a finger at them.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.427
They fired us.

31:42.530 --> 31:43.599
This is our fault.

31:43.630 --> 31:45.962
And we should have seen
the potential for conflict.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.490
(sighs)

31:47.530 --> 31:49.339
But put Dr. Wesley's
case to bed.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.133
Make the best
deal you can

31:51.170 --> 31:54.401
and get it
off your docket now.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.289
You asked me to follow up
on the information.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.289
As part of Dr. Wesley's case,
not to launch a new one

32:09.320 --> 32:10.457
against the pharmacy.

32:10.490 --> 32:13.482
I felt it was my professional
duty to follow through.

32:13.530 --> 32:14.690
By the way, the pharmacy

32:14.730 --> 32:16.698
may not have barcoded
Ben's prescription,

32:16.730 --> 32:21.099
but they also didn't
have 80-milligram ow
in stock that day.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.495
You just lost
reasonable doubt.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.531
(unzips case)

32:27.240 --> 32:28.639
If we could get
his jail time

32:28.680 --> 32:30.477
down to four months,
instead of a year...?

32:30.510 --> 32:33.445
That was yesterday's deal.
It's four years now,

32:33.480 --> 32:35.471
and_a re_voked
medical license.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.216
(sighs)

32:44.560 --> 32:46.551
So, we take it to trial.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.528
If that's what
you want to do,

32:50.560 --> 32:53.097
I can help find you
a lawyer to step in.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.097
What?

32:54.140 --> 32:55.164
Why?

32:57.370 --> 32:59.759
My firm has asked me
to settle this or help you

32:59.810 --> 33:01.505
find new representation.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.974
Four years in prison, I...

33:05.750 --> 33:09.311
My life would be over,
my career.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.788
I need a vacation.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.629
Yeah.

33:18.660 --> 33:21.356
He's facing four years
in prison,

33:21.400 --> 33:24.460
the loss of his job,

33:24.500 --> 33:27.526
and you know what?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.197
I didn't care.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.128
You?

33:31.170 --> 33:33.536
I wanted his problems
out of the ofﬁce.

33:33.570 --> 33:35.299
What's that say about me?

33:35.340 --> 33:38.377
Says you're
becoming a lawyer.

33:38.410 --> 33:42.210
I'm amazed at how little
I know about you.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.445
What do you
want to know?

33:44.490 --> 33:46.287
I'm not sure.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.309
Great.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.318
Two things.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.158
I looked at the paramedic's
run sheet.

33:52.190 --> 33:54.420
You're right, the times don't
add up. Looks like they parked

33:54.460 --> 33:55.722
Ben for 15 minutes.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.227
That's pretty damning.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.761
But privileged.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.394
Yeah, only if we
represent them.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.362
Right now, we don't.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.537
You want to blackmail
the hospital

34:06.570 --> 34:08.128
to make them our client again?

34:08.180 --> 34:09.499
I like it.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.098
Yeah, strategic.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.469
Second thing's even better.

34:12.510 --> 34:13.704
The gym guy

34:13.750 --> 34:16.548
wants to sell me some oxycodone.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.655
Are you and Grace
in therapy?

34:24.690 --> 34:27.818
In...? No.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.521
Family therapy.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.790
All this stuff
with your father.

34:31.830 --> 34:33.593
Oh.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.359
That... No, we're fine.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.699
It can have a serious effect on
your psychosexual development.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.435
I don't even think
about it that much.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.368
Zach, you've got pictures
on your computer

34:44.410 --> 34:46.742
of your dad with a hooker
and a crack pipe.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.672
ZACH:
How do you...?

34:50.720 --> 34:53.245
What are you talking about?

34:53.290 --> 34:55.508
I saw them when I was
checking my e-mail.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.187
Does your mom know?

34:57.220 --> 34:59.552
Don't tell her.

34:59.590 --> 35:00.818
You don't understand

35:00.860 --> 35:04.091
what's going on here.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.695
Dinner in ten minutes.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.712
CARY:
So, homemade
acai berry supplement.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.718
Yeah. Did you try it?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.638
No, not my speed.

35:25.690 --> 35:26.714
It's good stuff.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.218
Sometimes you need
a little more.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.511
You got knee pain?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.652
Yep. Stay awake
at night crying.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.783
(laughing)

35:33.830 --> 35:35.752
Oxycodone isn't cheap.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.749
These 805?
Yep.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.338
How much?
Twenty.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.610
How much for ten?

35:55.650 --> 35:56.844
200.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.381
And for a first-time customer,

35:58.420 --> 36:00.513
I'll throw in
a free Vike.

36:00.550 --> 36:01.687
All right.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.382
You sure you don't
need some 'roids?

36:04.430 --> 36:06.182
Just looking at
your muscle mass,

36:06.230 --> 36:07.481
you could do with some.

36:07.530 --> 36:09.953
What's wrong with
my muscle mass?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.423
Nothing wrong with
my muscle mass.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.631
(overlapping shouting)

36:14.670 --> 36:16.297
Hold it right there!
Oh, no, you don't!

36:16.340 --> 36:18.604
Don't move!
See how good I am
at repaying favors?

36:18.640 --> 36:19.561
Hmm.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.609
What do we have here,
the proverbial

36:26.650 --> 36:28.379
black book, hmm?
These all your customers?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.638
Don't I have the right
to remain silent?

36:32.890 --> 36:35.381
You recognize one?

36:35.420 --> 36:36.489
You sold to Ben Bowers--

36:36.520 --> 36:38.750
the high school football
player who OD'd.

36:38.790 --> 36:40.451
You sold to him.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.627
No, I never sell to kids.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.298
Ah, what a humanitarian.

36:43.330 --> 36:45.366
Stop lying.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.662
It's here.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.773
(knocking)

37:01.380 --> 37:03.610
Mrs. Bowers, may we speak
to you for a moment?

37:13.530 --> 37:15.555
Yes, Trey sold to me.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.919
I met him at the gym.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.361
Th-Things were just
really hard.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.992
My job and stress.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.598
Ben never knew about it.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.301
He didn't have access
to these,

37:25.340 --> 37:26.659
I swear.

37:26.710 --> 37:27.665
I counted them.

37:27.710 --> 37:29.769
There are exactly 11.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.641
May I?

37:33.710 --> 37:35.416
Look.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.742
They look identical.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.679
But kids take
aspirin tablets,

37:42.720 --> 37:44.426
shave off the markings
and ridges,

37:44.460 --> 37:45.620
round the edges

37:45.660 --> 37:48.891
so they look like
oxy tablets.

37:48.930 --> 37:50.420
See?

37:57.770 --> 38:00.307
Then they swap out
the real oxy

38:00.340 --> 38:02.308
with the fakes

38:02.340 --> 38:03.830
so it looks like
no pills are missmg.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.804
Oh, my God.

38:10.450 --> 38:13.510
Oh, my God.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.926
(TV playing in background)

38:19.960 --> 38:21.552
Hi.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.352
Hey.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.789
Hey.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.775
So you two are good,
aren't you?

38:34.810 --> 38:36.675
Yeah.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.701
Yeah.
Why?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.377
And you know you can come
to me with anything, right?

38:40.410 --> 38:41.741
Like what?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.611
I don't know.

38:43.650 --> 38:44.981
Anything.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.848
Do you think I should get
the HPV vaccine?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.767
The HPV?

38:58.800 --> 38:59.892
It's an STD,

38:59.930 --> 39:02.569
and you can get a
shot and it'll...

39:02.600 --> 39:03.965
Yes, I know what it is.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.558
Where's this coming from?

39:08.840 --> 39:13.072
Um, Molly says that we're
hypersexualized because of Dad.

39:13.110 --> 39:14.509
She what?!

39:14.550 --> 39:15.972
Yeah, and she said
that she got

39:16.020 --> 39:18.682
the HPV vaccine and that
I could get it, too.

39:18.720 --> 39:22.417
Okay, so this is something
we talk about together.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.779
Not with Molly.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.481
Okay.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.680
(keys jangling in lock)

39:32.070 --> 39:33.890
You're fired.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.761
Why?

39:35.800 --> 39:37.859
Let me give you a little lesson
for your next job.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.403
The next time you want
to talk to your charges

39:40.440 --> 39:41.839
about sexually-
transmitted diseases,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.007
talk to the parents.
What?!

39:44.040 --> 39:46.144
This is for the rest
of the week. Thank you.

39:46.180 --> 39:50.139
I never said anything about
sexually-transmitted diseases.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.545
They said I said that?

39:51.590 --> 39:52.739
Oh, they're lying.

39:52.790 --> 39:53.745
Take the check.

39:53.790 --> 39:56.759
It's because of what I saw
on their computer.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.729
That's why.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.022
Thank you.

40:02.060 --> 40:05.723
You don't know what's going on
in your own home, lady!

40:05.770 --> 40:07.590
SPORTSCASTER (on TV):
He shoots from 12 and it's good.

40:07.630 --> 40:09.598
Chicago up by nine.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.631
(sportscaster continues
indistinctly)

40:13.970 --> 40:16.700
Hey.

40:16.740 --> 40:19.072
Well?

40:19.110 --> 40:21.169
They're looking for wiretaps.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.848
My wife told them.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.211
Yeah.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.889
They want me to locate
the recordings.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.979
How would you do that?

40:29.020 --> 40:30.112
Through you.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.879
Why doesn't he just
subpoena me?

40:36.160 --> 40:37.752
He's worried what's on it.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.621
Or he doesn't
remember what's on it.

40:40.670 --> 40:41.967
Where you going?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.763
Home.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.802
I'm not done here.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.628
Glenn, if you want this to work,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.944
you need to give me something
to give them.

40:54.950 --> 40:56.941
Phone me when you have it.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.919
I'm so glad you made it.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.996
Are they taking
good care of you, Mom?

41:10.030 --> 41:12.726
Good enough.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.590
(phone rings)
PETER:
Do you need anything?

41:14.640 --> 41:15.891
No, I'm fine.

41:15.940 --> 41:19.034
I'm just happy to have
you all in one room.

41:19.070 --> 41:21.504
Yeah.

41:21.540 --> 41:22.677
So...

41:22.710 --> 41:24.268
Really?

41:24.310 --> 41:26.005
JACKIE:
Is Molly filling
my shoes at home? Hmm?

41:26.050 --> 41:28.177
No, Mom got rid of her.
What?

41:28.210 --> 41:31.008
ZACH:
Lasted three whole days.

41:31.050 --> 41:32.586
You were right.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.783
Well, Ijust...

41:37.060 --> 41:38.925
Thank you.

41:40.690 --> 41:43.158
We miss you, Grandma.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.565
Oh, you do not.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.624
We do.

41:51.870 --> 41:55.135
Childs is gonna give her
a listen to the taps.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.205
Looks like she
came through.

42:02.980 --> 42:05.039
Peter, your appeal,
how's it going?

42:05.090 --> 42:07.217
Well, you know what, Mom?

42:07.250 --> 42:08.888
There's been some
new developments.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.683
And I think it could be

42:10.720 --> 42:12.256
very, very good for us.

42:12.290 --> 42:14.087
Well...

42:14.130 --> 42:16.849
then maybe you'll be coming home
the same time I do.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.960
I certainly hope so.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.959
JACKIE:
Then things can
go back to normal.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.133
Wouldn't that be nice?
