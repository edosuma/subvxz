- Okay, everybody freeze.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.595
This is a hold-up.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.231
You, you, you, you.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.767
[woman's voice]
<i>We have to forgive them.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.636
Get down, get on your knees,
get on your knees.

00:34.669 --> 00:36.269
What's your name, Sir?

00:36.303 --> 00:39.272
- Carl.
- Carl, Carl, it's getting chilly in here.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.208
You! Come here, come here!

00:41.241 --> 00:42.542
Get down,
get on your fucking knees.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.680
Get down! Get on your knees,
get on your knees and stay scared.

00:45.713 --> 00:49.617
All right, if it is not clear
through our dramatic entrance...

00:49.651 --> 00:51.251
You, here, come here!

00:51.284 --> 00:54.656
And my gun slinging bravado,
or our general recklessness.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.289
Get down, stay there!

00:56.323 --> 00:57.659
We are here to hold you up.

00:57.692 --> 01:00.327
Take all the money out of the
drawer and put it in a plastic bag.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.764
- Carl?
- Shoot him!

01:02.797 --> 01:04.965
Hey, is this your first time?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.034
Yeah.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.636
- Take the money out of the drawer.
- Okay, okay.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.477
Put it in the bag.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.213
- Here.
- Very good.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.016
[man]
Give me your cash now!

01:22.050 --> 01:25.787
If you don't give me your cash right now, your
head's going into the back of that freezer.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.355
- [girl giggling]
- [indistinct whispering]

01:28.388 --> 01:30.792
[man] Give me
your fucking cash, now!

01:30.825 --> 01:32.459
Hey, could you take it down
a little bit?

01:34.028 --> 01:35.630
You're freaking everybody out.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.332
[woman whispering]
<i>Fly now. Do you forgive me?</i>

01:39.366 --> 01:40.968
May I give him the spare, sir?

[woman whispering] <i>They
brought me back to you, honey.</i>

01:43.638 --> 01:46.607
- <i>You're the most important person to me.</i>
- [indistinct whispering]

01:46.641 --> 01:49.443
Give the kids their money back.

01:49.476 --> 01:52.747
[man] Why would we come in and rob
a store and give the money back?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.548
Because it's a kid.

01:55.783 --> 01:59.486
- Give it back!
- You are absolutely ridiculous, you know that?

01:59.519 --> 02:01.155
[Kathy whispering]
<i>Shoot back. This is a hold up.</i>

02:01.189 --> 02:04.491
- [man] I'm gonna shoot 'em.
- [Kathy] <i>Take all the money out of the drawer.</i>

02:04.524 --> 02:06.293
- [man] <i>No.</i>
- We gotta go.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.329

[Elizabeth] <i>Kathy,
my name is Elizabeth.</i>

03:20.968 --> 03:23.771
I help people
out of different situations

03:23.805 --> 03:27.340
and I was called by a social
worker who knows about your case.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.377
And I know the event
that got you into jail

03:30.410 --> 03:34.682
but I don't think you
belong here. And um...

03:34.715 --> 03:38.052
Where, where am I
supposed to go?

03:38.085 --> 03:40.788
I think you should be
in a treatment center.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.491
- And...
- I don't do drugs or alcohol.

03:44.524 --> 03:49.664
No, but I think perhaps you might
need some medication to even you out.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.633
Maybe just for a little while,
maybe not forever.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.568
What's the medication for?

03:54.602 --> 03:58.438
Well, I think you may have
a chemical imbalance.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.174
Bipolar II.

04:00.208 --> 04:05.378
This could really account for some of your
highs and lows and some of your depression.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.014
We need
to get some tests done,

04:07.048 --> 04:10.117
get you into a place to get
your life on track.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.120
I just wanna see my daughter
one more time.

04:13.154 --> 04:17.058
Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here.
I just need you to sign off on that.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.860
[Kathy sniffles] Okay.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.761
[Elizabeth] Okay? Good.

[birds chirping]

05:29.063 --> 05:32.465
- Kathy, we're releasing you at the end of the month.
- But I have six more months.

05:32.499 --> 05:38.205
I know that you wanted the extra time,
but we are positive that you are ready.

05:38.239 --> 05:41.142
And you're gonna stay at your
mom and dad's for now, right?

05:41.175 --> 05:43.543
I know. I don't think that's
such a healthy decision.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.212
I understand, but where
are you gonna stay?

05:45.246 --> 05:48.649
Well, I guess I'll go try
to stay with my grandpa.

05:48.683 --> 05:50.785
- That's a fantastic idea.
- Okay.

05:50.818 --> 05:55.522
You'll have a space away from your parents but
you'll get to interact with your daughter.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.491
She'll get to come visit you
in a familiar place, right?

05:58.525 --> 06:02.495
I just feel like they're gonna
see me as who I was then.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.967
Of course they are,
and now they're gonna see who you are now.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.904
Just deal with it
moment by moment.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.772
- Yeah.
- This transition is stressful.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.207
- Of course it is.
- Hm-hm.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.878
- You can do this, okay?
- Okay.

06:17.912 --> 06:19.814
- You can do this.
- Okay.

Sure you got
enough feed, water?

06:50.745 --> 06:51.679
Oh,

06:54.715 --> 06:58.252

Cori?

07:31.252 --> 07:33.054
[laughs]

07:33.087 --> 07:34.989
Didn't recognize your voice.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.624
It's called puberty.

07:38.092 --> 07:39.693
Why are you calling?

07:40.194 --> 07:42.263
Why aren't you at grandma
and grandpa's right now?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.331
They're at the hospital
with grandpa.

07:46.067 --> 07:46.967
Cor.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.736
Dad wants to talk to you.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.272
It's Kathy.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.773
Yeah, thanks.

07:55.810 --> 07:58.145
[sighs] Haven't
heard from you for five months.

07:58.179 --> 07:59.914
What happened to grandpa?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.982
Heart attack.
Why haven't you called?

08:02.016 --> 08:04.385
I got transferred,
I haven't had time.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.187
[sighs] Yeah, well,
the old bastard's okay.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.824
Your dad found him,
got an ambulance out there quick enough.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.961
You could've picked up the phone
to call your daughter once a month.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.797
When you coming home, Kath?

08:16.831 --> 08:18.666
I'm gonna actually be home soon.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.501
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

08:21.168 --> 08:23.637
Can you just
tell Cori I love her?

Kathy, oh!

09:49.123 --> 09:52.359
Well, what a surprise!

09:52.393 --> 09:53.794
It's good to see you.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.730
- Good to see you too, honey. What... when did you...
- You look great.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.967
- Well, you do, too.
- Thanks. The car looks good.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.836
- You like the car?
- It looks beautiful.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.073
We've got it all sanded down,
repainted, upholstered.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.107
Wow.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.109
- Tires.
- The tires look great.

10:09.143 --> 10:11.779
I'm gonna get it in the 4th
of July Parade, I think.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.214
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

10:13.247 --> 10:14.982
How's grandpa doing?

10:15.849 --> 10:16.917
He's doing a lot better.

10:18.319 --> 10:21.422
- Hey, your mom's inside, let's go surprise her, huh?
- Awesome. Okay.

10:22.323 --> 10:25.226
- [Ed] When did you...?
- [Kathy] Oh, weeks ago.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.195
- [Ed] You might've called first.
- [Kathy chuckling]

10:33.267 --> 10:34.969
- Hi, hun.
- Hi.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.004
- We got company.
- What?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.872
Hey, mom.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.909
[laughs] Hi! What a surprise.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.345
I wasn't expecting you, hi.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.146
Hey, is Cori around?

10:46.180 --> 10:48.515
Uh, no, she spent the night
with a friend.

10:48.549 --> 10:50.017
Oh, Junior?

10:50.050 --> 10:54.888
Uh, no, no, I would've said she was
with her father if she was with him.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.992
Oh, okay, I just didn't know who
she's been spending time with.

10:58.025 --> 11:02.029
No, it's because you
haven't been around.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.264
[Ed] Well,
it's great to see you.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.933
Good to see you home again.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.302
We're both very happy
that you're home.

11:09.403 --> 11:10.938
[sighs]

11:16.010 --> 11:17.244
Um.

11:17.278 --> 11:19.913
I wish you would've called.
[laughs]

11:19.947 --> 11:23.984
We thought you wouldn't
be here for a couple of months.

11:24.018 --> 11:28.522
- Uh-huh.
- I called the DOC to find out what your release date was.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.592
You could've visited
and found out.

11:31.626 --> 11:33.060
Oh, well.

11:34.295 --> 11:37.364
With Cori's schedule,
that would have been complicated.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.133
Just once?

11:42.436 --> 11:44.438
I actually got out
four months ago.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.541
I got out on good behavior.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.177
They put me
in a transitional program

11:50.210 --> 11:55.049
and I worked a lot of things out
and got help from some friends.

11:55.082 --> 11:55.983
Friends?

11:56.984 --> 11:59.086
Yeah, friends, people
who care about you.

11:59.621 --> 12:03.023
Well, we think it's wonderful
that you're home again.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.193
Thanks, Dad.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.130
How did you hear about grandpa?

12:10.164 --> 12:11.231
Cori.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.900
Oh, so you do call.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.003
Grandpa's doing better. He got
released from the hospital,

12:16.036 --> 12:20.307
gonna spend a bit of time in the nursing
home, just until he gets his strength back.

12:20.341 --> 12:22.042
He's not getting
his strength back, Ed.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.280
Oh, so you're gonna
let him die there?

12:26.313 --> 12:28.482
- Oh, come on now, Kathy.
- Ed.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.018
You just got here,
now don't start.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.486
[Barbara] Kathy, please.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.023
Are you gonna sell the farm?

12:37.124 --> 12:42.062
[laughs] What are you now,
a real estate agent?

12:43.197 --> 12:47.401
I just care about it. I thought
we'd keep it for our future.

12:48.369 --> 12:52.072
Now, since when have you ever given
a good god damn about that farm?

12:52.106 --> 12:55.075
Well, I know you give a good
god damn about it, Ed.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.945
- [door shuts]
- [Cori] I'm home.

12:57.978 --> 13:02.149
We're in here, Cori. Wait till you
see how tall she's gotten. Look.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.032
What is she doing here?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.371
Your hair looks
so cute that way.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.441
It's just easier to pin up
for dance class.

13:29.410 --> 13:31.512
So how long are you staying?

13:32.312 --> 13:36.350
We'll have to clean out your room.
We've been using it to store some stuff.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.154
Oh, that's okay, you don't have to.
I'm going to get accommodations.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.322
No. Don't be silly,
this is your home.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.362
Um, by the way, in 20 minutes
we're all gonna go to Perkins,

13:48.395 --> 13:51.565
and after that I have World
Economy Think Tank 'till nine.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.100
- [Barbara] Okay.
- Cori?

13:53.534 --> 13:54.669
What?

13:56.270 --> 13:57.337
I'm home.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.206
Yeah.

14:04.378 --> 14:05.245
[sighs]

14:06.146 --> 14:07.581
It's gonna take some time.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.233
[chuckles]

14:59.266 --> 15:00.167
Huh?

15:03.805 --> 15:08.242
You're not your mother,
you're your mother's daughter. [laughing]

15:08.275 --> 15:10.277
[laughing]

15:16.216 --> 15:18.018
Need money or something?

15:19.553 --> 15:21.221
Mm-mm. No.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.726
I just came to see
if you were okay.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.094
[scoffs]

15:27.729 --> 15:29.196
How was jail?

15:31.799 --> 15:33.500
It was fruitful.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.203
[laughing] Yeah.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.742
You should've stayed out there.

15:41.609 --> 15:44.779
This place is dying.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.582
Ain't no way
to make a living anymore.

15:49.516 --> 15:53.153
Unless you're a factory farmer
like your dear old daddy.

15:55.823 --> 15:57.424
Son of a bitch.

15:58.425 --> 16:03.163
I heard he found you face down
in a pile of hog shit.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.768
Sounds like he saved your life.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.804
Didn't ask him to.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.240
Do I look sick to you?

16:15.743 --> 16:16.778
[Kathy] Mm-mm.

16:20.514 --> 16:21.749
Your mother

16:22.482 --> 16:24.251
and her sister

16:24.284 --> 16:28.388
are doing a pretty damn
good job of upsetting me.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.626
I'm an old man now.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.227
That's a state of mind.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.229
Hog shit.

16:36.731 --> 16:39.166
[laughing]

16:39.199 --> 16:43.570
Piss shit and pig shit
and horse shit.

16:43.605 --> 16:47.140
You wait until you get
into my saddle, little girl.

16:47.909 --> 16:49.309
You just wait.

16:54.849 --> 16:55.750
I just...

16:58.786 --> 16:59.754
I just...-

17:00.420 --> 17:01.588
Okay.

17:02.857 --> 17:05.358
I don't wanna die
in this goddamn place.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.328
Wow.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.897
I just wanna die

17:12.531 --> 17:16.604
in the same
plot of land as my daddy.

17:20.642 --> 17:21.809
Okay.

17:25.713 --> 17:27.214
I got an idea.

17:27.815 --> 17:30.752
How about
I go check on the hogs for you?

17:35.757 --> 17:37.224
Good thinking.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.697
Morons probably
forgot to feed the pigs.

17:46.901 --> 17:49.737
I'm gonna go and I'll see
what I can do.

17:50.605 --> 17:51.505
[smooches]

17:52.006 --> 17:53.573
Atta girl.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.277
Get me outta here.

18:16.931 --> 18:18.231
[door closing]

18:18.666 --> 18:20.467
[birds chirping]

18:20.500 --> 18:24.438
[soft country music]

18:30.912 --> 18:32.714
[chickens clucking]

18:32.747 --> 18:34.281
[cows mooing]

18:34.314 --> 18:35.717
[dog barking]

19:03.077 --> 19:06.047
[faucet dripping]

19:06.080 --> 19:09.449
[flies buzzing]

19:22.395 --> 19:27.400
[soft music]

20:07.407 --> 20:08.910
[sighs]

20:14.782 --> 20:17.084
How are Walter's children doing?

20:17.118 --> 20:20.487
- [Leah] We're great.
- Good, good. What can I do for you today?

20:20.520 --> 20:23.958
Leah and I were concerned
about our father's health and...

20:23.991 --> 20:25.592
I understand he had
a heart attack.

20:25.626 --> 20:30.898
Yes, and so we're trying to get information
in terms of what do we need to do to,

20:30.932 --> 20:33.835
is it power of attorney or what,

20:33.868 --> 20:36.604
that would help make sure that
he's taking care of himself.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.873
So what's the situation
with Walter?

20:39.707 --> 20:42.442
Well, he had a heart attack
in the pig pen.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.780
I mean, if Ed hadn't been out there to
see him, he would've died with the pigs.

20:45.813 --> 20:50.818
It is fortunate you were there, because
pigs can be brutal in that circumstance.

20:50.852 --> 20:54.088
Uh, is there
any mental problems?

20:54.121 --> 20:58.860
He's being stubborn about watching
out and being more careful,

20:58.893 --> 21:02.864
and it's kind of difficult.
And the older he gets, it's gotten worse.

21:02.897 --> 21:04.564
Just because you're difficult

21:04.598 --> 21:06.934
does not mean
that you're incompetent

21:06.968 --> 21:11.072
and require a power of attorney for
somebody else to handle the affairs.

21:11.105 --> 21:13.140
[Barbara]
What do we need to prove?

21:13.174 --> 21:18.079
Evidence that he is unable
to take care of himself.

21:18.112 --> 21:20.982
Being an eccentric,
being stubborn

21:22.984 --> 21:24.384
is not evidence.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.454
This is easy, we can do this and we
come to you and you will help us?

21:27.487 --> 21:30.490
- I will seek to assist you with that.
- [Leah] Thank you.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.391
[attorney] Okay.

21:33.995 --> 21:36.631
[rock music]

21:52.813 --> 21:56.651
- Excuse me, can I get a drink?
- [bartender] Sure, what are you having?

21:58.085 --> 22:00.655
Tequila, straight up, shot.

22:02.056 --> 22:03.490
[bartender] Coming up.

22:05.226 --> 22:06.627
Rough day?

22:08.029 --> 22:09.764
No, it's been a great day.

22:09.797 --> 22:13.234
- [chuckles]
- I can tell. Tequila straight up, yeah.

22:13.267 --> 22:14.902
I'm celebrating.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.570
You don't mind if I had one
with you, would you?

22:18.239 --> 22:21.474
- No, no, not at all.
- Leon, can I get the same?

22:23.010 --> 22:25.012
Are you old enough
to be drinking?

22:25.046 --> 22:27.081
Well, I'm old enough to be
sitting here with you.

22:27.915 --> 22:29.884
- [laughs]
- You don't remember me, do you?

22:29.917 --> 22:32.720
- No.
- I'm Phil and Julia's kid, David.

22:32.753 --> 22:37.792
Oh my God! I graduated
with your parents.

22:37.825 --> 22:39.193
I didn't know that.

22:39.226 --> 22:41.762
- Bottoms up to that. [laughs]
- Cheers.

22:41.796 --> 22:42.763
Cheers.

22:44.298 --> 22:45.166
[groans]

22:46.767 --> 22:47.702
Wow.

22:49.170 --> 22:52.940
- Have you ever done a shot of tequila before? [laughs]
- [groans] No.

22:54.976 --> 22:56.877
See how you're doing.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.516
- Close. [clears throat]
- You... Just come on.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.087
- I'm... I'm going.
- Give it a little more love, just...

23:08.990 --> 23:10.891
- [groans]
- You wanna do one more?

23:10.925 --> 23:14.161
Of course. Leon, two more.

23:15.096 --> 23:16.563
[laughs]

23:21.802 --> 23:23.137
Cheers.

23:25.639 --> 23:26.506
Mm.

23:27.108 --> 23:28.843
Dinah, Dinah.

23:28.876 --> 23:30.778
Where does it come out?

23:34.181 --> 23:35.483
[chuckles]

23:35.515 --> 23:40.087
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's just cute, date night.

23:40.121 --> 23:41.722
Where's our daughter?

23:43.357 --> 23:45.626
- With your parents.
- Cheers.

23:47.895 --> 23:49.196
- [Kathy] Mm.
- [Junior] All right.

23:51.298 --> 23:52.299
Perfect.

23:53.566 --> 23:57.738
You and Dinah Squire,
always pictured you two together.

23:57.772 --> 23:59.840
[Kathy]
It's just cute, just cute.

23:59.874 --> 24:01.275
- Oh.
- Just my ex.

24:01.308 --> 24:05.012
Oh. Leon... Leon, can we
get two more down here?

24:05.046 --> 24:09.183
Yeah, well, get three,
one for the new mother of my child.

24:11.018 --> 24:12.286
Kathy's drunk again.

24:12.987 --> 24:16.023
Oh, oh, no, I'm not drunk.

24:16.057 --> 24:18.125
I'm just getting started, honey.

24:19.860 --> 24:21.729
She was

24:22.363 --> 24:25.266
stacked like a brick shit house,

24:25.299 --> 24:29.303
the homecoming queen,
and I was pregnant,

24:29.336 --> 24:31.639
huge as a puffer fish
with our baby.

24:31.672 --> 24:35.276
And during that time,
she was actually screwing my baby daddy.

24:35.309 --> 24:37.344
You know what, Kathy,
you crossed the line, okay?

24:37.378 --> 24:40.848
- You're drunk as a skunk, why don't you leave, please?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

24:40.881 --> 24:42.516
It's all good. It's all good.

24:42.550 --> 24:45.886
- But come and share a shot. Come and share a shot, Dinah.
- Yeah, I don't want one.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.257
She won't share a shot with me
but she'll share the same man.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.959
- Oh, God.
- I'll drink to that.

24:51.992 --> 24:54.895
You know what? You make...
You make me sick.

24:57.998 --> 25:00.668
You know what? Stay away
from my daughter.

25:01.869 --> 25:04.405
You mean stay away
from your daughter like you do?

25:04.438 --> 25:05.306
Oh.

25:06.040 --> 25:06.874
[Kathy] Oh, yeah.

25:06.907 --> 25:08.976
- [Junior] No, no.
- Bring it, bitch!

25:09.009 --> 25:10.244
[Junior] No, no, no!

25:10.277 --> 25:11.579
- Stupid!
- Stop it!

25:11.612 --> 25:14.782
- You take that back! You son of a bitch!
- Hey, what the hell?

25:14.815 --> 25:16.450
Stupid slut!

25:16.484 --> 25:21.755
- Walk it out, honey.
- God! I'm gonna pull your hair extensions out, you stupid slut!

25:21.789 --> 25:22.990
[sighs deeply]

25:23.791 --> 25:26.894
[rooster crowing]

25:26.927 --> 25:29.797
[soft country music]

25:37.771 --> 25:39.773
[water fizzing]

25:58.025 --> 26:00.761
Do you have to sit there?
You're in my way.

26:00.794 --> 26:01.829
Seriously?

26:01.862 --> 26:03.230
I need to move around.

26:06.867 --> 26:08.736
I don't think
you can help your grandpa.

26:08.769 --> 26:10.337
Leah and I

26:11.071 --> 26:14.241
don't think it's safe for him to
be on the farm, he's not well.

26:15.042 --> 26:18.179
The farm's just a big
jungle gym, he's gonna fall,

26:18.212 --> 26:21.282
break his hip and blame us
for being in a wheelchair.

26:21.315 --> 26:22.983
I don't need that,
and neither does she.

26:23.017 --> 26:25.786
I'll make it safe. I'll make it happy.
I'll make it nice.

26:25.819 --> 26:29.089
He can live out the rest of his life there.
He deserves that.

26:29.890 --> 26:33.294
Why are you laughing?
Don't you want that for him?

26:33.327 --> 26:36.931
[chuckling] I don't think
of the farm as a happy place.

26:38.866 --> 26:40.334
It was very tough on us.

26:41.302 --> 26:42.303
Still is.

26:43.237 --> 26:46.006
Momma always said
he should have had boys.

26:47.841 --> 26:48.842
You know.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.946
Farm's in the past.

26:51.979 --> 26:54.114
Besides, why do you care?

26:56.350 --> 26:59.253
Three years in a jail cell
makes you think about things.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.956
What did they make you do there?

27:02.790 --> 27:04.892
- In prison?
- Yeah.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.362
Lotta laundry.

27:09.964 --> 27:12.533
Got really
good at folding clothes.

27:12.566 --> 27:14.134
[laughing]

27:14.168 --> 27:16.804
Could definitely be
manager of the Gap.

27:17.504 --> 27:19.073
Well, I'll have

27:20.441 --> 27:24.011
to write a letter to the Department
of Correctional Services.

27:25.079 --> 27:28.349
I could never get you to do
laundry, let alone fold clothes.

27:28.382 --> 27:29.483
Mm-hm.

27:29.516 --> 27:31.819
[laughing]

27:31.852 --> 27:35.789
Look, Mom, you're looking at
free home care right in the eye,

27:35.823 --> 27:38.392
you can't pay for grandpa's
long-term healthcare.

27:38.425 --> 27:42.796
You can take all that money and you
can put it in Cori's college savings,

27:42.830 --> 27:44.231
how perfect would that be?

27:47.034 --> 27:50.137
Well, you're a big girl.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.973
Don't need to ask permission

27:54.275 --> 27:57.778
to clean up the old place,
make it look nice.

27:58.912 --> 28:00.881
That would be very helpful.

28:03.117 --> 28:04.218
[smooches]

28:09.189 --> 28:11.959
[bright country music]

28:53.534 --> 28:54.935
[gagging]

29:32.674 --> 29:34.241
[glass breaking]

29:36.510 --> 29:38.011
[groans]

29:39.279 --> 29:42.049
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

29:42.082 --> 29:44.184
[Junior] Ed hired me to do some
work around here.

29:44.218 --> 29:45.720
- He hired you?
- Yep.

29:45.754 --> 29:49.123
Wow, you've sure gotten close with
the family unit since I've been gone.

29:49.156 --> 29:50.958
[groans] Not really.

29:50.991 --> 29:53.026
Yeah, really, he hired
you, didn't he?

29:53.060 --> 29:55.129
[sighs] Yeah, he hired me.

29:57.164 --> 29:59.199
Figures, prodigal
son he never had.

29:59.233 --> 30:00.501
I wouldn't go that far, Kath.

30:00.534 --> 30:02.035
No, you wouldn't.

30:02.069 --> 30:04.138
Just like you wouldn't visit me
in jail, either.

30:04.171 --> 30:07.074
But you'll go running to Ed
as soon as he needs you.

30:07.107 --> 30:08.442
[sighs] I should've
visited you in jail,

30:08.475 --> 30:11.478
but you know what? Some of us had
responsibilities to deal with.

30:11.512 --> 30:12.413
Time flew by.

30:12.446 --> 30:16.049
It didn't for me.
How's working with Ed?

30:16.083 --> 30:18.620
- [ladder clatters]
- Okay, you know what?

30:18.653 --> 30:20.187
I like working for your dad.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.423
He works on a large scale.

30:22.456 --> 30:24.458
He's got a thousand hogs
under one roof.

30:24.491 --> 30:25.526
[sighs]

30:26.560 --> 30:28.228
Of course, it makes me
a little anxious sometimes

30:28.262 --> 30:30.230
seeing living things
in such tight quarters.

30:30.264 --> 30:31.666
Yeah. I know what that's like.

30:33.233 --> 30:36.937
Since I've been working there, coming
over here, seeing the pigs running around.

30:38.172 --> 30:41.942
Now I feel like all I really need
is my garden and some free pigs.

30:45.345 --> 30:48.248
A garden and some pigs,
are you kidding me?

30:51.318 --> 30:53.053
I wanna be a successful farmer.

30:54.388 --> 30:55.657
And I wanna puke.

30:55.690 --> 30:57.024
You know what?

30:57.558 --> 30:58.425
Wake up.

30:59.359 --> 31:02.095
Times are tough,
money's hard to come by.

31:04.799 --> 31:06.233
We're lucky,

31:06.266 --> 31:09.069
we're lucky your mom and dad have
given Cori the life that they have.

31:09.102 --> 31:09.938
We're lucky?

31:09.970 --> 31:12.306
Yeah, we're lucky,
and you know what?

31:12.339 --> 31:14.742
No matter what mistakes you've
made and I've made in our lives,

31:14.776 --> 31:16.711
you're her mom and I'm her dad.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.279
Yeah, well, you're the biggest
goddamn mistake I ever made.

31:19.313 --> 31:21.716
No, uh-huh, no.

31:21.749 --> 31:22.650
[groans]

31:24.752 --> 31:26.688
[Kathy] Don't you give me...!

31:28.055 --> 31:30.658
- [Kathy] Okay.
- Okay, that's good, you're tough, you're really tough.

31:30.692 --> 31:32.426
[groaning]

31:33.160 --> 31:35.128
[Junior]
I am trying to help you!

31:35.162 --> 31:36.563
[Kathy] With what?

31:36.597 --> 31:39.734
- [Junior] Fixing this place up, making it nice for Walt!
- [Kathy] Why?

31:41.769 --> 31:43.337
You're doing the right thing.

31:44.238 --> 31:45.640
[groans]

31:45.673 --> 31:48.008
[chuckles] Okay, okay.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.713
Fine, you wanna make it
safe for Walter?

31:52.446 --> 31:54.081
Then you make it safe for him.

31:56.684 --> 32:00.287
And at the same time,
fix up a bedroom for Cori.

32:04.091 --> 32:06.226
[chuckles] I can do that.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.329
[chickens clucking]

32:21.809 --> 32:24.779
Yes, ma'am,
I was in jail for three years.

32:26.881 --> 32:31.285
Now I'm back here, and I'm living
on my grandpa Church's farm,

32:31.318 --> 32:33.086
I'm trying to fix it up.

32:34.622 --> 32:38.125
And bring my little daughter, who's
12, out to the farm to live with me.

32:38.693 --> 32:40.828
You have a criminal record.

32:41.495 --> 32:44.766
Yes, I know, I wrote it
down on the application, I...

32:48.402 --> 32:52.740
And that is what is
so gosh darn refreshing.

32:55.175 --> 32:56.678
Let's give it a try.

32:57.679 --> 33:00.147
Okay, are you...
[clears throat]

33:00.180 --> 33:01.381
If you're sure.

33:01.415 --> 33:05.485
[chuckles] I'm not sure at all.
We're just gonna try it out.

33:05.519 --> 33:08.188
Show up seven o'clock
tomorrow morning.

33:08.221 --> 33:10.390
My regulars come in about 7:30,

33:10.424 --> 33:12.694
I'll give you the run down
on what we need to do.

33:12.727 --> 33:15.763
- I'll be here at 6:45.
- [chuckles] Okay.

33:15.797 --> 33:18.165
[rooster crowing]

33:18.800 --> 33:21.703
[soft music]

33:34.514 --> 33:37.484
[birds chirping]

33:37.517 --> 33:40.755
[insects chirping]

33:43.223 --> 33:44.291
[Kathy] I said I'm getting out.

33:44.324 --> 33:48.896
[laughs] So he took you
to the A&W, that cheap SOB.

33:48.930 --> 33:50.898
[laughing]

33:50.932 --> 33:54.468
- Was old man McCoy there? He's living... he lives there.
- [bell rings]

33:54.501 --> 33:56.536
- Hey, kiddo.
- [Cori] Hi.

33:56.570 --> 34:00.240
Oh my gosh, that Cori
is the spitting image.

34:00.273 --> 34:02.509
[Kathy] And who's your friend?

34:02.542 --> 34:04.746
- [Aaron] I'm Aaron.
- Hi, Aaron.

34:06.213 --> 34:08.148
So are you really her mom?

34:08.616 --> 34:13.621
Yes, I am. I am the proud
parent of this gorgeous girl.

34:13.655 --> 34:15.657
[laughs]

34:15.690 --> 34:17.792
But I thought that Barbara
was your mom.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.426
No, I told you she's my grandma.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.594
Kathy's my biological mother.

34:21.629 --> 34:25.667
But that doesn't really mean anything nowadays,
it's whoever raised you that counts.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.237
What, would you like
to have something?

34:30.270 --> 34:34.241
Oh, may I please have a chocolate
cheesecake with whipped cream on top?

34:34.274 --> 34:37.377
- Yes.
- Excellent choice. It's the least stale.

34:37.411 --> 34:40.748
I'm just kidding, everything's
fresh, nothing's stale.

34:40.782 --> 34:43.751
And Cori, Miss Cori,
what will you have?

34:43.784 --> 34:45.252
I'm fine.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.790
You don't want anything?
Come on!

34:48.822 --> 34:49.891
I'm sure.

34:49.924 --> 34:52.927
Well, how about fresh baked
chocolate chip scones?

34:52.960 --> 34:54.594
That was your favorite.

34:55.462 --> 34:56.764
That was your favorite.

34:56.797 --> 34:58.498
It was my favorite, not anymore.

34:58.532 --> 35:00.367
- Okay.
- But you wouldn't know.

35:01.301 --> 35:02.704
Well,
how about a fountain drink?

35:02.737 --> 35:04.739
Caffeine blows out my adrenals.

35:05.405 --> 35:10.978
Well, maybe a nice plate of
organic kale dust or fresh air.

35:11.012 --> 35:12.947
[chuckles]
It's not very filling.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.682
[chuckles] Thanks, cute.

35:15.315 --> 35:19.386
- Um, here is the pie.
- Thanks.

35:19.419 --> 35:23.691
And thank you
for asking for a...

35:23.725 --> 35:26.393
For what? I didn't
order anything.

35:27.294 --> 35:28.930
How'd you find out
I was working here?

35:28.963 --> 35:31.298
I know where my mom works.

35:31.866 --> 35:33.735
I asked your parole officer.

35:36.037 --> 35:38.271
That's really funny, Cori.

35:38.305 --> 35:39.406
It was a joke.

35:39.439 --> 35:40.507
I'm not laughing.

35:41.709 --> 35:43.044
Why'd you hire her? She has
a criminal record, you know.

35:44.344 --> 35:47.347
I'm sure there were many able
individuals in need of employment

35:47.380 --> 35:48.816
that could fit the position.

35:48.850 --> 35:53.420
Well, that's true, Cori. There was
a lot of well-qualified applicants

35:53.453 --> 35:55.957
with extensive
and impressive resumes.

35:55.990 --> 35:57.658
Just like yours is, I'm sure.

35:57.692 --> 36:00.995
But, you know, I wanted to hire
somebody who was nice.

36:03.030 --> 36:05.332
That pie looks disgusting.

36:07.668 --> 36:08.736
It's delicious.

36:09.436 --> 36:10.905
[Aaron] It was nice meeting you.

36:10.938 --> 36:15.977
Well, that is one intense teenager
you got coming on there, girlfriend.

36:16.010 --> 36:19.080
[soft music]

36:19.113 --> 36:22.617
[insects chirping]

36:41.035 --> 36:43.971
[Kathy] It's just a short visit
today, but it's gonna be worth it.

36:44.005 --> 36:45.438
[Walter] Oh, boy.

36:45.472 --> 36:48.709
[Kathy] Grandpa,
am I okay to be Cori's mom?

36:48.743 --> 36:51.646
[chuckles] Better
than anyone I know, why?

36:51.679 --> 36:53.247
[Kathy] You know, with all
my meds and stuff.

36:53.281 --> 36:57.752
[Walter] Yeah, well, they wouldn't keep
insulin from a diabetic, would they?

36:58.552 --> 36:59.620
[Walter] You'll be fine.

37:00.755 --> 37:04.391
I think you'll be happy
with the pigs. They look plump.

37:04.424 --> 37:06.493
They'd better not be too plump.

37:06.526 --> 37:09.362
You check the water?
They're always turning it over.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.866
They've got plenty of water,
they're all good.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.936
Who's taking care of 'em?

37:16.103 --> 37:17.605
[Kathy] Junior.

37:17.638 --> 37:19.874
Junior? Are you shitting me?

37:19.907 --> 37:23.044
That son of a bitch don't know
a damn thing about farming.

37:28.649 --> 37:30.450
I cleaned up a little bit.

37:30.483 --> 37:31.719
You did what?

37:32.653 --> 37:34.021
It was a mess.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.960
Ta-da!

37:41.629 --> 37:42.529
Look.

37:42.964 --> 37:44.497
What do you think?

37:45.166 --> 37:46.533
[Kathy] Do you like it?

37:46.566 --> 37:48.401
[Walter] Where's my easy chair?

37:50.437 --> 37:51.639
Your easy chair?

37:51.672 --> 37:55.743
- Well...
- Your easy chair had fleas and a broken armrest.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.880
No, no, no, I had
that chair for 40 years.

37:59.714 --> 38:03.918
Well, I don't know what kind of Raid grandma
used on it, but it sure didn't work for me.

38:03.951 --> 38:08.022
I... I don't like new things.

38:08.055 --> 38:11.826
If I wanted new things,
I would've asked for new things.

38:13.694 --> 38:15.763
Let's go look at the kitchen.

38:15.796 --> 38:19.599
[sighs] Took me a long time
to get the grime off the stove.

38:19.634 --> 38:22.970
Everything was fine
the way it was.

38:23.004 --> 38:26.941
Well, great, I can take some hog shit
and I will smear it on the counters

38:26.974 --> 38:29.409
and then you can be
right at home!

38:43.925 --> 38:47.094
It's time to take you back,
they only gave us 30 minutes.

38:51.531 --> 38:54.534
Why do I have to go
back to that place?

38:54.567 --> 38:56.737
Because your heart's
still mending.

38:57.738 --> 39:00.942
Okay, they ain't never gonna
let me outta there.

39:01.676 --> 39:02.877
Oh, yeah, they will.

39:04.312 --> 39:06.981
But you have to mind your P's and
Q's, you gotta be nice to the nurses.

39:07.014 --> 39:08.616
You gotta be patient.

39:09.650 --> 39:11.886
And we're
gonna bust you out, g-force.

39:14.554 --> 39:15.690
[birds chirping]

39:15.723 --> 39:17.725
[rooster crowing]

39:19.727 --> 39:22.263
[soft music]

39:22.296 --> 39:24.165
[oil crackling]

39:24.198 --> 39:25.900
What are you doing here?

39:25.933 --> 39:27.001
Hey, morning.

39:27.935 --> 39:29.737
I'm making breakfast.

39:31.038 --> 39:35.710
Eggs cool, over easy? I always
forget, sunny side up or over easy?

39:36.744 --> 39:37.845
I don't do yolk.

39:38.312 --> 39:39.180
Oh.

39:39.847 --> 39:40.982
Okay, um.

39:43.017 --> 39:44.852
What should I get you instead?

39:46.220 --> 39:47.587
[Kathy] What do you want?

39:48.255 --> 39:50.157
Egg whites are fine.

39:50.191 --> 39:51.292
[Kathy] Egg whites?

39:51.325 --> 39:52.660
- [Cori] In the fridge.
- Okay.

39:52.693 --> 39:56.529
- [Cori] Middle shelf to the left.
- Okay, middle door to the left.

39:56.563 --> 39:58.199
Awesome. [chuckles]

40:01.902 --> 40:05.572
Okay, so we'll
make you egg whites.

40:05.606 --> 40:07.641
[Cori] You forgot
to re-oil the pan.

40:08.809 --> 40:11.812
You're absolutely right,
I did forget to re-oil the pan.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.951
So we'll pour this out.
How's school?

40:16.984 --> 40:17.918
[Cori] Good.

40:17.952 --> 40:19.787
[Kathy] Got a boyfriend?

40:19.820 --> 40:21.956
- [Cori] Nope.
- [Kathy] Um...

40:23.991 --> 40:25.226
You want a boyfriend?

40:25.926 --> 40:27.128
[Cori] Don't care.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.897
[Kathy] You don't care
about boys?

40:30.364 --> 40:32.199
[Cori] I don't know.

40:32.867 --> 40:34.068
Surprise, surprise.

40:34.835 --> 40:36.704
You just, uh, let yourself in?

40:37.138 --> 40:41.609
Yeah, I just thought I'd make
you guys some eggs this morning.

40:41.642 --> 40:44.178
Uh-huh, yeah, you're
cooking, I see?

40:44.211 --> 40:49.850
I know, it's... I'm determined
to cook and make these eggs.

40:50.384 --> 40:51.352
Wow.

40:51.385 --> 40:52.753
[Kathy] Impressive, huh?

40:52.787 --> 40:54.789
Maybe. What's up with the pan?

40:54.822 --> 40:56.757
- Ah!
- [Junior] Oh my God!

40:57.925 --> 41:00.161
- [Kathy] Okay, okay.
- [Junior] Seriously? Maybe...

41:00.194 --> 41:01.896
Mother material, isn't she?

41:01.929 --> 41:02.830
Cor.

41:03.798 --> 41:06.167
- It's okay.
- I'm trying to... [sighs] No.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.702
Don't worry about it. I'll make
us something and you just...

41:08.736 --> 41:11.305
No, no, no, I came to make eggs,
and I'm gonna make eggs,

41:11.338 --> 41:14.742
and we're all gonna sit down and have
a family breakfast together, okay?

41:14.775 --> 41:15.609
I have to go.

41:15.643 --> 41:19.847
What? No, wait,
wait a second, hey, hey.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.816
I can pick you up
from school, you know?

41:21.849 --> 41:25.019
[scoffs] You mean in that
death trap of junk on wheels?

41:25.052 --> 41:26.153
No, thanks.

41:26.187 --> 41:27.221
Um.

41:28.355 --> 41:30.991
Besides, I'm booked 'till
nine every day this week.

41:31.025 --> 41:31.992
Booked?

41:32.026 --> 41:33.761
- Booked.
- Yeah.

41:33.794 --> 41:35.663
Choir, then track, 4:00 to 5:00,

41:35.696 --> 41:38.165
every other day I have
clarinet practice 3:30 to 4:00.

41:38.199 --> 41:40.701
Talented and gifted class
5:30 to 7:00,

41:40.734 --> 41:43.404
think tank 7:00 to 8:00,
dance class 8:00 to 9:00.

41:43.437 --> 41:44.738
She's a dancer.

41:44.772 --> 41:46.740
Holy shit,
when do you chill out?

41:48.876 --> 41:51.178
Holy crap, when do you rest?

41:51.212 --> 41:53.147
Like you did in high school?

41:53.180 --> 41:56.283
And please, let's nix the swearing
in the house when you visit.

41:57.918 --> 42:00.321
- Bye, hun, have a good day.
- Bye, Dad, love you.

42:00.354 --> 42:01.388
Love you, too.

42:03.224 --> 42:05.926
[Junior] The bus is here anyway,
don't worry about it, it's fine.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.329
I'm not worried about it.
I'm just making eggs.

42:08.362 --> 42:09.897
I'll make us something
and you just...

42:09.930 --> 42:11.966
No, no, no, I wanna finish this.

42:12.700 --> 42:16.070
- You did good, I mean, that's just...
- No, I really didn't but...

42:16.103 --> 42:19.907
You just need to spend some
mother-daughter time. Take her to the pool.

42:19.940 --> 42:23.777
[kids yelling]

42:23.811 --> 42:27.781
[indistinct chatter]

42:30.351 --> 42:32.253
This pool's awesome.

42:32.286 --> 42:33.721
Yeah, I know, right?

42:33.754 --> 42:37.258
When did they put all the slides and
the umbrellas and all that stuff?

42:37.291 --> 42:38.459
[Sonya] Oh, my God! It's Kathy.

42:38.492 --> 42:39.994
I think like two,
three years ago.

42:40.027 --> 42:44.331
- [Sonya] That's Cori's mom.
- [Kathy] Who's... who's your friends here, Cori?

42:44.365 --> 42:48.202
I don't know, it's everybody?

42:51.105 --> 42:53.307
[Sydney chuckling]
Look at her bathing suit.

42:54.341 --> 42:56.143
- What?
- [giggling]

42:56.944 --> 43:00.247
- [whispering]
- Are people talking about us?

43:00.281 --> 43:01.348
I don't know.

43:02.750 --> 43:03.817
You don't know?

43:04.885 --> 43:07.454
Nobody says hi to you
when you come to the pool?

43:07.488 --> 43:08.657
They usually do.

43:10.758 --> 43:11.425
Aaron?

43:12.493 --> 43:15.262
Sonya's mom said that Cori's
as crazy as you are.

43:15.296 --> 43:17.164
And then Sonya
just goes around the school

43:17.198 --> 43:20.501
telling all the boys that she's a
slut who's gonna get pregnant at 16.

43:20.534 --> 43:22.770
- Shut up.
- Which one is Sonya?

43:22.803 --> 43:25.072
She's the one over there
with the red hair.

43:25.105 --> 43:27.841
[Kathy] You're kidding,
Dinah Squires' kid?

43:27.875 --> 43:30.110
This little girl coming up
here right now?

43:31.278 --> 43:33.180
[Cori] Um, yeah.

43:37.785 --> 43:38.752
What the hell?

43:40.154 --> 43:41.055
Mom, don't.

43:43.257 --> 43:45.025
Well, at least we can't get
in a bar fight.

43:47.928 --> 43:50.464
Um, how's school going?

43:50.497 --> 43:51.498
It's fine.

43:53.133 --> 43:55.002
- [Kathy] Uh, grades?
- [Cori] Fine.

43:55.035 --> 43:56.470
[Kathy]
How's Barbara and Ed doing?

43:56.503 --> 44:00.808
Fine, look, if there's some arbitrary
story of my life thing going on,

44:00.841 --> 44:02.009
could you get to it?

44:02.910 --> 44:04.178
Chill out.

44:05.112 --> 44:07.381
I'm just trying to ask you
how you're doing.

44:08.015 --> 44:10.884
- Why?
- Because I've been gone for a while

44:10.918 --> 44:13.020
and I just wanted to know
how you feel since...

44:14.588 --> 44:16.090
...since I left.

44:16.857 --> 44:18.959
Well, first I was proud.

44:18.993 --> 44:20.027
You were proud?

44:20.060 --> 44:22.529
Yeah, grandpa said you were
serving our country.

44:22.563 --> 44:24.298
[chuckles] He did?

44:24.331 --> 44:28.035
Yeah, and then Aunt Leah told me that you were
in the Department of Correctional Services.

44:28.068 --> 44:31.038
Oh, great, we love
Aunt Leah, pillar of truth.

44:31.071 --> 44:33.807
So when did you get gated out?

44:33.841 --> 44:34.808
What?

44:34.842 --> 44:38.245
Like topped out, finished
with the program.

44:38.279 --> 44:40.347
've seen prison movies like <i>Oz</i>.

44:40.381 --> 44:42.149
What? [chuckles]

44:42.182 --> 44:44.518
This isn't <i>Oz</i>, this is Iowa.

44:45.386 --> 44:46.920
What are you talking about?

44:46.954 --> 44:48.422
Have you ever shanked someone?

44:48.455 --> 44:50.190
What?

44:50.224 --> 44:54.028
Like melted your toothbrush into a shiv and
then like bled someone out in the shower.

44:54.061 --> 44:56.363
No, Cori, no, I have never
done that.

44:56.397 --> 44:59.933
What are you talking about?
Who's letting you watch <i>Oz</i> ?

44:59.967 --> 45:02.136
Dad, Ed, Barbara.

45:02.169 --> 45:05.572
Great, we're gonna get parental
controls on the TV like that.

45:05.607 --> 45:07.074
I'll watch whatever I want.

45:07.107 --> 45:09.476
Excuse me? Excuse me?

45:09.510 --> 45:11.111
[scoffs] You're not
in charge of me, Kathy.

45:11.145 --> 45:16.116
Parental controls? Like you're such a
good parent. You were a ward of the state.

45:17.251 --> 45:19.119
Well, I'm still your mom.

45:19.153 --> 45:20.954
And please don't call me Kathy.

45:21.455 --> 45:22.356
Whatever.

45:31.666 --> 45:34.001
Come on, Aaron, let's go
check out the slide.

45:39.039 --> 45:39.973
[sighs]

45:40.007 --> 45:42.176
[soft country music]

45:47.481 --> 45:50.517
Girls, hey, do you guys
want something to drink?

45:51.218 --> 45:52.920
Wow, check this out.

45:54.388 --> 45:55.824
Get her on the back of the head.

45:57.291 --> 45:58.392
[Aaron] Oh!

45:58.425 --> 46:00.094
Mom, what are you doing?

46:00.628 --> 46:02.996
- What the hell?
- [whistle blowing]

46:04.098 --> 46:05.065
Seriously?

46:05.099 --> 46:08.268
- [Sonya] What happened?
- [girl] Are you okay?

46:08.969 --> 46:13.140
[coughing] I'm fine.

46:14.007 --> 46:18.680
Hey, hey, do you not get we live
in a small town? What was that?

46:18.713 --> 46:21.949
Come on, what was that
back there?

46:25.085 --> 46:29.256
I was trying to teach her a lesson on
how to stand up to assholes like that.

46:30.190 --> 46:32.593
They picked on her like they
picked on me when I was a kid.

46:32.627 --> 46:35.529
Okay, well, that wasn't
exactly what I had in mind

46:35.562 --> 46:37.598
when I was talking about
mother-daughter bonding.

46:38.232 --> 46:40.033
How could you let her watch <i>Oz</i> ?

46:40.067 --> 46:43.203
[sighs] It's an award-winning
program.

46:43.971 --> 46:46.473
And I wanted her to know
what your life was like.

46:46.507 --> 46:50.978
I did not reside in an all-male
high-security prison, you asshole.

46:53.580 --> 46:56.250
You're trying too hard,
that's it, okay?

46:57.484 --> 46:59.253
It's not gonna happen overnight.

47:00.755 --> 47:03.625
Hey, did you ever shank anyone?

47:06.460 --> 47:07.594
Go dry off Dinah.

47:10.097 --> 47:13.367
[soft country music]

47:42.797 --> 47:44.031
[Junior] Hey, sweetie.

47:44.064 --> 47:45.032
[Cori] Hey, Dad.

47:45.532 --> 47:46.734
What you working on there?

47:47.534 --> 47:48.535
Homework.

47:50.404 --> 47:52.439
[crows squawking]

47:52.473 --> 47:53.974
You know, you don't
have to work here.

47:54.709 --> 47:57.277
I'm just trying to get
my world economy done.

47:57.779 --> 47:59.146
World economy.

48:05.820 --> 48:07.221
[sighs]

48:08.589 --> 48:10.457
I know it's weird having
her back, isn't it?

48:11.258 --> 48:12.192
Yeah.

48:13.060 --> 48:14.027
Yeah.

48:15.830 --> 48:20.702
You know, your mom and I both have
made some bad decisions in life.

48:20.735 --> 48:21.669
Like me?

48:22.369 --> 48:25.072
No, not you.

48:26.373 --> 48:30.678
As a matter of fact, you're the best
thing that ever happened to us, okay?

48:33.681 --> 48:36.216
Had we planned on having a kid?

48:36.250 --> 48:39.621
- No.
- No, no.

48:39.654 --> 48:40.788
But you know what?

48:41.689 --> 48:43.257
I think you saved us.

48:44.358 --> 48:47.427
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for you, I know that.

48:49.129 --> 48:50.063
Here's the thing.

48:51.331 --> 48:53.433
You got something inside of you
that's beautiful and is powerful

48:53.467 --> 48:55.602
and it's something that your mom
and I never had.

48:56.871 --> 49:00.173
And I think maybe that scares
your mom a little bit,

49:01.542 --> 49:03.544
like she feels like
she's not good enough for you.

49:04.779 --> 49:05.747
She isn't.

49:06.513 --> 49:07.481
[scoffs]

49:07.514 --> 49:08.448
Well,

49:09.851 --> 49:12.219
you two have
a lot of similarities.

49:12.820 --> 49:15.122
- Like what?
- The good stuff.

49:16.290 --> 49:20.561
Your eyes, the way you smile,
the way you light up a room.

49:21.261 --> 49:24.131
That's coming from something
inside that's beautiful.

49:26.133 --> 49:27.601
I can't go back and change.

49:30.170 --> 49:31.606
But I can start over.

49:33.307 --> 49:35.208
And that's
what your mom's looking for.

49:35.242 --> 49:36.744
And when I say your mom,

49:37.845 --> 49:39.146
I mean your mom.

49:42.617 --> 49:43.851
I love you, sweetie.

49:46.353 --> 49:49.089
Love you too, Dad. [sniffles]

49:54.494 --> 49:55.630
[sighs]

49:57.564 --> 50:00.367
- [punching]
- [heavy breathing]

50:15.382 --> 50:17.451
[goat bleating]

50:19.419 --> 50:20.354
[Kathy] Hey.

50:22.389 --> 50:23.323
What do you want?

50:24.391 --> 50:25.492
Hey.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.335
Takes a lot of faith
to do what you're doing.

50:38.606 --> 50:39.674
What am I doing?

50:40.474 --> 50:41.408
You're here.

50:42.442 --> 50:43.678
Big deal.

50:43.711 --> 50:44.846
It is a big deal.

50:45.613 --> 50:47.414
[sighs] Nobody wants me here.

50:48.916 --> 50:50.250
I want you here.

50:52.219 --> 50:53.655
Do something with me.

50:57.457 --> 50:58.458
Sometimes,

50:59.894 --> 51:01.528
when I need strength,

51:01.561 --> 51:03.163
I just ask for it.

51:05.667 --> 51:07.735
Were you gonna pray
or something?

51:07.769 --> 51:09.403
Let's try it.

51:18.378 --> 51:19.279
[Junior] Lord,

51:20.648 --> 51:24.652
please give Kathy the strength
to be the mother she wants to be.

51:26.253 --> 51:30.825
Please, give Walter the strength
to stay in his home.

51:31.558 --> 51:33.828
And give Kathy
the strength to watch over him.

51:35.763 --> 51:37.230
And please,

51:38.933 --> 51:43.236
give Cori the strength to know that we're
trying to be the parents she wants us to be.

51:44.538 --> 51:47.441
In your name we pray, amen.

51:49.276 --> 51:50.011
Amen.

51:53.881 --> 51:59.386
[bright music]

52:44.564 --> 52:47.969
[birds chirping]

52:48.002 --> 52:49.302
Thank you.

52:50.872 --> 52:51.873
You can do this.

52:52.974 --> 52:54.508
- Careful.
- Okay.

52:55.877 --> 52:57.078
Watermelon.

52:57.111 --> 52:58.012
It's all good.

52:58.780 --> 52:59.579
[Cori] Yum.

52:59.614 --> 53:02.549
Oh, boy, this looks
like something.

53:02.582 --> 53:03.651
- Yes.
- Yeah.

53:04.886 --> 53:06.486
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

53:07.387 --> 53:09.456
- Yeah.
- The corn was grown by Junior.

53:09.489 --> 53:12.660
- Oh.
- Pass me some of that corn there.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.461
Peas?

53:15.495 --> 53:17.430
- Certainly.
- I'll take that.

53:22.569 --> 53:23.570
[clears throat]

53:24.839 --> 53:27.909
It's a shame that Ed isn't here,
he would've really liked this.

53:27.942 --> 53:31.646
[chuckles] He had to go to the
meeting with the Iowa pork producers.

53:31.679 --> 53:34.982
Oh, yeah, isn't he
the president?

53:35.016 --> 53:36.583
[laughing]

53:36.617 --> 53:39.386
So, Aunt Leah, how long
are you staying?

53:39.419 --> 53:42.690
Oh, I just got a little bit more business
to take care of, so I think maybe a week.

53:43.390 --> 53:45.392
How is ballet, Cori?

53:45.960 --> 53:47.061
Oh, it's great.

53:48.029 --> 53:51.464
So I invited you all
here for a reason.

53:51.498 --> 53:53.968
Other than just
your deli case chicken?

53:54.669 --> 53:56.704
Just crack me up, Leah.

53:56.737 --> 53:58.706
- Leah.
- What? I like deli case chicken.

53:58.739 --> 53:59.874
Yeah, well, it's a time saver.

54:04.712 --> 54:09.050
I have been here cleaning up
the farm and planting things

54:09.083 --> 54:10.718
and taking care of the house,

54:10.751 --> 54:13.120
and Junior even came
and fixed stuff up

54:13.154 --> 54:18.993
and I just think it would be a great idea if
Grandpa came home and I took care of him.

54:20.962 --> 54:23.563
- What?
- Uh, Kathy,

54:23.597 --> 54:25.666
I don't think this is the right
place to bring that up.

54:25.700 --> 54:26.834
You would do that?

54:27.735 --> 54:29.502
[Leah] Whoa, whoa.

54:29.536 --> 54:34.976
After all these years, you think you're just
gonna swoop in here and fix all of our problems?

54:35.843 --> 54:37.645
What about your daughter?

54:39.479 --> 54:42.016
I used to love coming out here
when I was her age.

54:42.049 --> 54:45.920
We can go fishing,
we can feed the hogs,

54:45.953 --> 54:48.723
we can plant flowers,
wouldn't that be fun?

54:49.223 --> 54:52.592
Again, you're promising all sorts of
things you'll never follow through with.

54:53.160 --> 54:56.664
- You really are a piece of work, aren't you, Leah?
- [Leah] Oh, and what next?

54:56.697 --> 54:59.466
- Junior, stay out of it.
- Junior's gonna come in here and play daddy?

55:02.036 --> 55:03.137
Oh.

55:03.170 --> 55:05.172
Oh, this is really precious.

55:08.109 --> 55:11.612
Kathy does what Kathy wants
in the moment.

55:12.179 --> 55:16.549
And then when it's no longer convenient
for her, she packs up and leaves.

55:16.583 --> 55:18.585
That's the history,
that's dad's future.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.121
Enough, okay?

55:20.154 --> 55:21.554
Oh, and then here comes Junior,

55:21.588 --> 55:24.759
like a knight in shining armor and
you all live happily ever after.

55:27.061 --> 55:30.631
You know, you are a cockatrice.

55:30.665 --> 55:33.134
- And you're an asshole.
- That's enough, Leah.

55:33.167 --> 55:35.636
Yes, yes, it is.

55:38.239 --> 55:39.640
- Dad?
- Yeah.

55:39.674 --> 55:41.474
What's a cockatrice?

55:41.976 --> 55:46.914
Oh, hun, it's a head of a rooster,
barbed tongue, tail of a snake,

55:46.948 --> 55:48.515
you know, hatched by a serpent.

55:49.951 --> 55:50.985
That's about right.

55:54.088 --> 55:56.090
Kathy, why don't I help
you with the pie?

55:56.757 --> 55:58.693
[Junior] Something sweet
would be nice.

56:03.731 --> 56:05.933
[Barbara] You can't take care
of him, Kathy.

56:05.967 --> 56:07.034
Why not?

56:08.669 --> 56:10.938
Are you prepared
to shave him in the morning?

56:11.571 --> 56:14.909
Dry him off after a shower?
Wipe his butt.

56:14.942 --> 56:18.679
Mom, he is perfectly capable
of doing all of that himself.

56:18.713 --> 56:19.747
How do you know?

56:19.780 --> 56:22.616
Because I've been spending
a lot of time with him.

56:25.953 --> 56:27.755
Where did your grandfather die?

56:27.788 --> 56:29.256
Don't.

56:29.290 --> 56:32.860
Your grandpa died on this farm,
why can't my grandpa die on this farm, too?

56:32.893 --> 56:35.029
That's all he wants,
he wants to be here.

56:35.062 --> 56:36.864
Oh, enough, Kathy.

56:36.897 --> 56:40.668
He is not gonna last longer than
a year in that nursing home.

56:40.701 --> 56:42.269
You don't know how
to take care of him.

56:42.970 --> 56:45.639
Well, at least he's willing
to let me try.

56:46.307 --> 56:49.143
You're not seeing
this thing in the way it is.

56:49.176 --> 56:52.246
Yes, yes, Mom, I am.

56:52.279 --> 56:53.881
I am.

56:53.914 --> 56:56.050
He wants his dignity.

56:57.651 --> 57:00.587
And I intend to give him that.

57:00.621 --> 57:01.856
You don't understand.

57:02.757 --> 57:06.761
Leah is intent on having him
claimed incompetent.

57:08.629 --> 57:09.864
Incompetent?

57:10.998 --> 57:12.767
Jesus Christ.

57:14.101 --> 57:16.037
[scoffs] I just...

57:16.070 --> 57:20.141
I just love how easy it is to put
labels on things, incompetent.

57:20.908 --> 57:23.744
First, he was an alcoholic all my
life, now he's incompetent,

57:23.778 --> 57:26.113
- now I am crazy or bipolar or whatever...
- Kathy.

57:26.147 --> 57:30.618
No, our family has dealt with anxiety and
depression for years and years and years,

57:30.651 --> 57:34.288
and you just ignore it and label
it, and he and I are the bad guys.

57:35.089 --> 57:37.158
You just like to put us
into this little box

57:37.191 --> 57:39.693
so that we're not human beings,
we're just a thing.

57:41.328 --> 57:43.631
It's much easier for you
that way.

57:43.664 --> 57:44.799
[sighs]

57:46.500 --> 57:50.271
Just think about how you're gonna come
across to Cori if you go through with this.

57:53.007 --> 57:54.742
[Kathy]
Letting you out of the clinker.

57:54.775 --> 57:58.012
Goodbye, the old, dirty bedpan.

57:58.045 --> 58:01.649
- Are you sure you don't wanna go up and give it a kiss?
- Stinky, stinky old bedpan.

58:01.682 --> 58:05.319
- What do they need it for?
- Oh, go give it a kiss, grandpa. You're going home.

58:05.352 --> 58:07.721
[soft country music]

58:30.978 --> 58:35.649
[panting and sniffing]

58:38.819 --> 58:40.054
[Kathy] Grandpa?

58:40.087 --> 58:45.893
- [moaning]
- Grandpa, grandpa? What's going on?

58:45.926 --> 58:50.197
I'm sorry. Get me
some water, please.

58:53.367 --> 58:54.902
Grandpa, are you sick?

58:54.935 --> 58:57.972
No, no. I'll be all right.

58:58.005 --> 59:03.010
If I just stay here long enough.
Sometimes it goes away.

59:03.043 --> 59:04.311
What goes away?

59:04.345 --> 59:08.883
From the war, some sort
of shell shock, just...

59:10.718 --> 59:12.153
Keeps hanging around.

59:12.186 --> 59:14.889
Got it, got it, got it,
let's get you up.

59:16.257 --> 59:18.159
- Does your chest hurt?
- No.

59:18.192 --> 59:19.894
- It's alright.
- [coughs]

59:20.427 --> 59:21.829
Shh.

59:21.862 --> 59:24.999
- Come on, let's get you outta here. Let's get you into bed.
- Yeah.

59:25.032 --> 59:28.369
- Okay. There you go.
- Yeah.

59:28.402 --> 59:30.905
- [Walter] Oooh.
- Take you onto the bed.

59:30.938 --> 59:34.308
- Yeah, let's go to bed. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

59:34.341 --> 59:38.879
[Kathy] One, two, one more,
now sit down.

59:41.015 --> 59:44.451
- [groans] All right, doesn't it feel better?
- Oh, yeah.

59:44.485 --> 59:46.420
- Does it feel better? Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:46.453 --> 59:48.422
Okay, should we lay you down?

59:48.455 --> 59:51.759
- Let's get this off your face and lay you down, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:51.792 --> 59:55.296
Okay. I got grandma
all wrapped around you.

59:55.329 --> 59:56.697
[groans] Yeah.

59:56.730 --> 59:59.366
- [chuckles] This was her favorite quilt.
- I'm wrecking her quilt.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.203
Yeah. No, you're not wrecking it, Grandpa.
That's what it's for.

01:00:02.236 --> 01:00:04.205
Oh, I feel hot.

01:00:04.238 --> 01:00:05.239
Okay.

01:00:06.207 --> 01:00:08.342
So, do Leah and mom
know what's going on?

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:13.080
No, and no one needs to know
a damn thing about none of this.

01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:15.749
Well, I need to know
'cause I'm taking care of you,

01:00:15.783 --> 01:00:18.052
- so you gotta let me know what's happening.
- Oh, you just

01:00:18.085 --> 01:00:22.790
take care of your own business.
[mumbles]

01:00:27.461 --> 01:00:30.998
[Kathy] I already got you
started. [chuckles]

01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:34.168
Please tell me.
What is it? What's going on?

01:00:34.201 --> 01:00:35.135
[groans]

01:00:36.203 --> 01:00:40.941
They've got all sorts
of fancy names for it now.

01:00:41.909 --> 01:00:47.414
Combat stress and post-traumatic
dysfunctional bullshit.

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:51.018
I don't know. I don't know.
It just keeps hanging around.

01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:53.220
How long has it been
hanging around?

01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:55.356
[groans] Don't ask.

01:00:55.389 --> 01:00:56.757
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.494
[camera shutter clicks]

01:01:00.527 --> 01:01:01.996
[mumbling]

01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:05.299
Yeah, we can figure
this out together.

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:07.167
[Walter] I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:08.135
[Kathy] Okay.

01:01:21.448 --> 01:01:27.254
[eerie music]

01:01:39.566 --> 01:01:44.838
[heart beating rapidly]

01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:52.880
[heart beating slower]

01:01:52.913 --> 01:01:56.450
[chickens quacking]

01:02:02.456 --> 01:02:04.391
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:11.633
Yeah, my doctor says
that these are prescribed

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:14.468
mostly for people with serious
mental afflictions.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:18.372
Yeah, so what? I'm bipolar.

01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:20.608
So what?

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:22.209
So...

01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.547
I just... I don't understand why
you didn't tell me about this.

01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:30.918
I didn't know what was going on.

01:02:30.951 --> 01:02:32.386
I just felt distracted.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:35.989
I had to find these rushes. Why do
you think I did all that crazy shit?

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:37.424
I mean now.

01:02:38.793 --> 01:02:40.561
- Because I'm not...
- Why didn't you tell me since you were back?

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:43.597
I'm here and you didn't tell me.
This is still going on.

01:02:43.631 --> 01:02:48.202
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't cuddle up
next to you and say "Honey, I'm bipolar."

01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:59.146
Well, so you're unfit?

01:03:00.682 --> 01:03:02.516
Unfit to be Cori's mom?

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:05.886
Excuse me?

01:03:05.919 --> 01:03:09.323
Yeah, this is way bigger than I
thought, way bigger than anyone thought.

01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:11.992
This runs deep,
it's genetics and stuff.

01:03:12.025 --> 01:03:13.994
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:03:15.329 --> 01:03:16.597
I don't want you around her.

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:18.365
Why not?

01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:20.968
Why not? I...

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.169
It's just...

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:25.105
I don't know,
it could trigger something.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.275
- How out of touch with reality can you be?
- Oh.

01:03:29.576 --> 01:03:33.013
This isn't helping, this isn't
helping anything at all.

01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:34.181
Yeah.

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:40.020
Can we just move
past this, please?

01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:44.091
All right.

01:03:57.504 --> 01:03:58.439
Fuck.

01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:04.344
[water flowing]

01:04:04.378 --> 01:04:08.081
[crickets chirping]

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:17.625
- [unsettling music]
- [heavy breathing]

01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:20.027
[woman] <i>You're gonna continue
the Depakote?</i>

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.262
[Junior] <i>You're unfit, genetics.</i>

01:04:22.296 --> 01:04:24.264
- [woman] <i>Continue the Depakote.</i>
- [sobs]

01:04:24.298 --> 01:04:27.134
[Junior] <i>You're unfit to be her mom.
You taking drugs? Drugs?</i>

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:29.369
[woman] <i>You're on medication
because this is a very...</i>

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:31.438
[Junior] <i>This is a little
bigger than I thought.</i>

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:34.107
- [woman] <i>Continue the Depakote.</i>
- [Junior] <i>This runs deep.</i>

01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.076
[water fizzing]

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:45.319
[wind blowing]

01:04:45.352 --> 01:04:48.188
[leaves rustling]

01:04:50.524 --> 01:04:53.160
[Walter] Hmm. Smells good.

01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:55.095
Good morning.

01:04:55.128 --> 01:04:57.097
It sure looks
that way, doesn't it?

01:04:57.765 --> 01:04:59.199
What's the matter?

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:01.568
What do you mean?

01:05:01.602 --> 01:05:04.271
[laughs] Is it that time
of the month or something?

01:05:04.304 --> 01:05:06.507
Jesus, Grandpa, no.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:08.776
I'm just tired, that's all.

01:05:14.515 --> 01:05:16.718
Hey, did you ever think
about writing down

01:05:16.751 --> 01:05:18.786
all of your experiences
from the war?

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.423
Yeah, I did. And, uh, I'd
rather chew on wet concrete.

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:27.795
I mean, if you don't write it down,
it's gonna keep pecking at you,

01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:31.131
and maybe if you just got started,
a little push is all it would take.

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:33.166
You might like it.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.571
I don't need a little push.
Can't I just get on with my life?

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:38.673
Hup.

01:05:38.706 --> 01:05:41.441
Whoop-de-doo, very nice.

01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:44.144
Don't you want people
to remember

01:05:44.177 --> 01:05:46.446
what you went through
or be able to read about it?

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.217
Just like you want somebody to keep
farming this farm after you're gone?

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.520
No, I don't. Good eggs though.

01:05:53.554 --> 01:05:55.188
Okay,
take the eggs, for example.

01:05:55.222 --> 01:06:00.327
Mom gave me the recipe for those and grandma
taught her and someday I'll teach Cori.

01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:03.363
We pass it down.

01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:06.734
Oh. I get it,
so that's what this is about.

01:06:06.768 --> 01:06:09.637
Yours and Cori's future.

01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:13.741
Yeah, so why don't you
go read Cori a bedtime story

01:06:13.775 --> 01:06:16.343
instead of spending your time
with an old man?

01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:22.182
- Sorry, I'm just...
- Well, can't a man just eat some goddamn eggs

01:06:22.215 --> 01:06:24.719
in peace and quiet?
Jesus Christ.

01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:26.788
Hey, I didn't mean
to piss you off.

01:06:26.821 --> 01:06:28.221
Well, you did.

01:06:28.255 --> 01:06:30.524
I know you've
been snooping around,

01:06:30.557 --> 01:06:33.795
looking at my pictures
and digging into my business.

01:06:33.828 --> 01:06:35.763
You threw all my stuff out.

01:06:36.463 --> 01:06:39.901
Did it ever occur to you that
I like my house the way it was?

01:06:39.934 --> 01:06:43.805
Did it ever occur to you that you
wouldn't be here if it weren't for me?

01:06:44.639 --> 01:06:46.273
Surprise.

01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:48.275
Mom and dad and Leah are out

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.444
trying to get some lawyer
to declare you incompetent,

01:06:50.477 --> 01:06:52.512
they're saying
you can't take care of yourself.

01:06:52.546 --> 01:06:55.549
So if I weren't here with you,
you'd be gone.

01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:00.487
Well, it's you,
Mother goddamn Teresa.

01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:02.189
You know,

01:07:03.123 --> 01:07:05.425
you're here on this farm
for one reason.

01:07:06.661 --> 01:07:10.263
You want the farm.
You don't give a shit about me.

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:11.531
Grandpa, that's...

01:07:11.565 --> 01:07:14.368
Why don't you just do yourself
a favor and get the hell out?

01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:15.402
What?

01:07:15.435 --> 01:07:17.304
Get out, go on.

01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:19.607
You heard me.

01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:22.610
Just get the hell out.

01:07:24.244 --> 01:07:25.345
- [sighs]
- But what about...

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:26.614
Go on!

01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:30.450
[birds chirping]

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:39.226
[soft music]

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.671
[indistinct whispering]

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.678
[Kathy] Alright.

01:07:57.544 --> 01:07:58.980
Oh, God. All right.

01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:01.348
Cori is 5 now, Mom.

01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:03.383
- [giggling]
- [Kathy] <i>4, Dad.</i>

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:05.853
[indistinct whispering]

01:08:05.887 --> 01:08:10.524
[Kathy] <i>25, 5. Junior, 5, 25.</i>

01:08:10.557 --> 01:08:12.459
Together, 25, 5.

01:08:12.492 --> 01:08:15.730
No, 22, 30,

01:08:15.763 --> 01:08:18.800
33, 33, 33.

01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:43.356
[sighs]

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:48.696
[footsteps clanging]

01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:03.644
[Walter] <i>She wants me to talk
about the war.</i>

01:09:05.578 --> 01:09:07.715
I didn't start it,
that's for sure.

01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.853
<i>But we all had to go.</i>

01:09:16.957 --> 01:09:20.694
They took the brightest
and the best.

01:09:26.968 --> 01:09:31.371
[wind whistling]

01:09:42.549 --> 01:09:46.787
[soft music]

01:09:56.631 --> 01:10:01.535
[intense rock music]

01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:19.854
[grunts]

01:10:55.723 --> 01:10:56.691
Kath?

01:10:59.627 --> 01:11:00.828
Whoa.

01:11:01.796 --> 01:11:03.698
[whistles] Kathy?

01:11:06.466 --> 01:11:08.501
- Whoa.
- Do you like it?

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:11.038
What's going on here, babe?

01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:12.073
It's a fort.

01:11:12.773 --> 01:11:14.108
- A fort?
- For Cori.

01:11:14.141 --> 01:11:15.643
For Cori?

01:11:15.676 --> 01:11:18.646
When you move here and she moves here,
she can have this safe fort to play in.

01:11:19.881 --> 01:11:21.849
I don't think it's safe.

01:11:21.883 --> 01:11:23.751
- Of course it is.
- Of course.

01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.486
Well, because five times five
is five's the safety number,

01:11:26.519 --> 01:11:28.990
and then five for you, mom, dad,
grandpa and Cori

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:31.458
and then I ran this vertical
ascension and descension

01:11:31.491 --> 01:11:32.793
and so everything's all good.

01:11:32.827 --> 01:11:35.129
Cori's not gonna have
any accidents.

01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.966
I knew this was
gonna be your reaction.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.501
- I knew it, I knew it.
- What did you take?

01:11:41.534 --> 01:11:43.104
Don't look at me
like that... don't.

01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:44.839
I'm not... this is safe, okay?

01:11:44.872 --> 01:11:47.675
And you know what,
we're free finally, we're free,

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:51.045
and I don't want you to take that away
from me right now 'cause it's not fair.

01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:52.947
It's not fair,
and you're not gonna do it.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.082
What did you take, Kathy?

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.752
[Kathy]
What is that supposed to mean?

01:11:58.819 --> 01:12:01.622
We're free, I quit, I'm done.

01:12:01.656 --> 01:12:04.591
I'm done, I'm me,
and this is us, here we are.

01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:05.927
This is good.

01:12:06.627 --> 01:12:07.828
I feel great.

01:12:07.862 --> 01:12:09.864
I have never felt
so good in my life.

01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:13.734
I am building things I never
thought I could build before,

01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:16.871
and we're all gonna be safe
and this is what you wanted.

01:12:16.904 --> 01:12:20.473
- This is what you wanted and I... I didn't.
- It... It's not what I wanted.

01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:21.876
You're freaking me out
a little bit.

01:12:21.909 --> 01:12:23.543
- I'm freaking you out?
- Yeah.

01:12:23.576 --> 01:12:25.880
You're freaking me out. How come
you're having this reaction?

01:12:25.913 --> 01:12:29.116
You disapprove of everything that I do.
Can I not do anything right for you?

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.119
Just, let's backtrack a little bit.
What nothing did you not take?

01:12:32.153 --> 01:12:34.822
I didn't take anything.
I'm not gonna take anything.

01:12:34.855 --> 01:12:37.524
Right. Depakote, it's nothing?

01:12:37.557 --> 01:12:39.026
What are you doing?

01:12:39.894 --> 01:12:42.630
Why... don't do that,
don't do that.

01:12:42.663 --> 01:12:43.596
Sweetie.

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:48.535
[whimpers] Don't sweetie me, don't sweetie
me. Don't look at me like I'm pathetic.

01:12:48.568 --> 01:12:52.940
I'm sorry for what I said. It made
you not take what you needed to take.

01:12:52.974 --> 01:12:56.677
You said not to take anything. You want
me to take something or nothing or what?

01:12:58.879 --> 01:12:59.981
[sobbing]

01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:02.683
- Oh my God, Kathy.
- Don't walk away from me, please.

01:13:02.717 --> 01:13:05.119
No, I'm not, I just... I want you
to take your medication.

01:13:05.152 --> 01:13:07.021
- You know what, you know I'm bipolar.
- No.

01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:10.291
I'm bipolar. There's
where we're totally fucked.

01:13:10.324 --> 01:13:14.862
We are totally screwed because you
don't want that, but that's what I am.

01:13:14.895 --> 01:13:18.833
And you didn't want what I was before, when I
was normal, but now I'm not normal anymore.

01:13:18.866 --> 01:13:19.834
No.

01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:21.501
Which do you want?

01:13:23.104 --> 01:13:25.172
I want you. I want Cori's mom.

01:13:25.206 --> 01:13:29.643
That's an idea in your head.
That is an idea of what I was.

01:13:30.344 --> 01:13:33.080
- I made the mistake, okay?
- You made what mistake?

01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:38.252
I made the mistake to confront you like
you're a bad person for taking medication.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.921
Yeah.

01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:42.990
It's my ignorance, you're right.

01:13:43.024 --> 01:13:44.524
I just want to...

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:49.263
It's my fault, it's
my fault. Let's go inside.

01:13:49.296 --> 01:13:52.767
[sobs] I don't wanna go inside.
My whole body is starting to hurt.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.036
Come on, please. I'm sorry.

01:13:55.069 --> 01:13:57.304
[sobs] I wanna be
where I'm safe.

01:13:57.338 --> 01:14:01.876
[soft music]

01:14:50.658 --> 01:14:55.763
[cicadas chirping]

01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:58.265
[phone calling]

01:14:58.299 --> 01:15:03.104
Yeah, um, I need
a ride to Forest City.

01:15:07.374 --> 01:15:10.177
[car horn honking]

01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:15.783
[soft music]

01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:20.187
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:15:20.221 --> 01:15:22.256
[Cori] Okay, I'm coming, God.

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.726
[car beeps]

01:15:26.827 --> 01:15:30.164
We're gonna raid my dad's beer
cabinet and then find someplace to go.

01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:33.200
[soft music]

01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:36.137
[birds chirping]

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:37.071
[door opens]

01:15:39.907 --> 01:15:41.876
Cori, who'd you say
lived here again?

01:15:41.909 --> 01:15:44.245
My grandpa, but he's not home.

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:46.113
This is awesome.

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:48.048
What exactly are we doing here?

01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:51.218
Well, first, you're gonna
hand me that beer. Thank you.

01:15:51.919 --> 01:15:54.989
Don't move stuff around,
my dad will freak. Get off.

01:15:55.022 --> 01:15:56.290
Calm down.

01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.727
Guys, we shouldn't
be here right now.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.195
Don't worry so much, Aaron.

01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:04.131
Seriously. Oh, okay, get up against
the wall, get up against the wall.

01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:06.300
- [boy] Oh, yeah.
- [man] You know what I'm talking about?

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:07.201
[boy] Mm-hmm.

01:16:08.335 --> 01:16:09.870
[man] Okay.

01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:14.942
Okay, you ready? It's good.
Okay, guys, watch this.

01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:19.013
[heavy breathing]

01:16:28.756 --> 01:16:31.458
[laughing]

01:16:31.492 --> 01:16:33.127
- That's awesome.
- Wow.

01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:36.363
- Out.
- [Aaron] What's up?

01:16:36.397 --> 01:16:37.398
[laughter]

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:39.767
It was like less
than 10 seconds.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.935
[boy groans]

01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:42.903
That was so killer.

01:16:42.937 --> 01:16:46.073
- What was it like?
- It was like a dream.

01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:48.275
Like a different plane
of reality.

01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:50.110
[man] Dude, all right, me next.
Come on, do me.

01:16:50.144 --> 01:16:53.280
- No, no, do me, do me.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:16:53.314 --> 01:16:55.049
Don't be an ass, why not?

01:16:56.817 --> 01:17:00.387
Okay, Cori, when you pass out,
you go to a whole different place.

01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:02.022
You have to be ready for that.

01:17:03.557 --> 01:17:04.758
[boy] Can you handle it?

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:08.295
- Last time I checked, yeah.
- [chuckles] But you're a girl.

01:17:08.329 --> 01:17:10.898
Women have greater pain
thresholds than men.

01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:13.901
- [chuckling]
- Seriously, Cori, this is not a good idea.

01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:14.835
Shut up, Aaron.

01:17:15.469 --> 01:17:17.204
Are you gonna do it or not?

01:17:17.238 --> 01:17:19.873
[dramatic music]

01:17:31.452 --> 01:17:32.486
Wait, wait, hand me that.

01:17:36.056 --> 01:17:37.258
[coughs]

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:41.562
All right, okay, what you're gonna do
is you're gonna breathe really fast,

01:17:41.595 --> 01:17:43.430
like you're hyperventilating,

01:17:43.464 --> 01:17:46.533
and then when I push
on your chest, just let go,

01:17:46.567 --> 01:17:47.801
- okay?
- Okay.

01:17:48.369 --> 01:17:53.173
- All right, ready?
- [heavy breathing]

01:18:01.949 --> 01:18:06.353
[both] Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:18:06.387 --> 01:18:10.491
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:18:10.524 --> 01:18:13.360
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- [heart beating]

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:19.433
[Kathy] <i>Cori!</i>

01:18:21.135 --> 01:18:22.536
[laughing]

01:18:25.506 --> 01:18:28.575
- [man] Oh, dude.
- [laughing] Dude.

01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:32.079
- She is down.
- Hard to put out, isn't she?

01:18:32.112 --> 01:18:33.447
Yeah, harder
than your pansy ass.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.282
[laughs] Wow.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.318
What the...

01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:38.919
[Aaron] Oh. Guys.

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:43.190
- She's not breathing.
- [boy] It's not funny.

01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:48.062
- Shit, she's not breathing.
- I just told you that, you just... do something about it.

01:18:48.095 --> 01:18:50.064
- [man] Careful, careful.
- [boy] Got her?

01:18:50.097 --> 01:18:52.433
Set her down, set her down,
easy, easy.

01:18:52.466 --> 01:18:53.867
Gently.

01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:57.204
- Just call for help! Cori, Cori, you can...
- Go get help. Hurry! Cori!

01:18:57.237 --> 01:19:00.274
- [Aaron] Help, help!
- Cori, please get up. Cori, you need to get up.

01:19:00.307 --> 01:19:02.176
- [man] Come on. Wake up.
- [boy] Please help!

01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:06.947
- [Aaron] Oh my God!
- [boy] Somebody, please! Somebody, help!

01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:11.653
- [man] Get up! Cori, get up!
- [boy] Help!

01:19:11.686 --> 01:19:15.657
- Cori, please get up.
- [Walter] What, what happened?

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:17.558
- [Aaron] Oh, my God!
- She's not breathing!

01:19:17.591 --> 01:19:19.093
Get out of the way!

01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:20.194
Cori.

01:19:20.662 --> 01:19:21.995
Okay.

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:23.864
[Walter] Cori.

01:19:24.965 --> 01:19:26.333
[groaning]

01:19:29.637 --> 01:19:31.472
[groaning]

01:19:46.621 --> 01:19:48.355
[blowing]

01:20:03.705 --> 01:20:07.207
- [coughing]
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:20:07.241 --> 01:20:09.677
- [Cori crying]
- Oh.

01:20:11.512 --> 01:20:12.546
Come here.

01:20:12.579 --> 01:20:16.150
[soft music]

01:20:16.183 --> 01:20:17.084
[lock opening]

01:20:23.223 --> 01:20:25.693
- Where is she?
- Downstairs.

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.662
What happened?

01:20:27.695 --> 01:20:31.298
Well, she was drinking beer

01:20:31.331 --> 01:20:35.335
with some of her friends
over at your grandpa's barn

01:20:35.369 --> 01:20:38.138
and they were
playing this fainting game.

01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:43.510
And Cori fainted,
didn't come to.

01:20:44.378 --> 01:20:49.516
Luckily, your grandpa was nearby
and he was able to revive her.

01:20:50.384 --> 01:20:51.518
Grandpa revived her?

01:20:52.186 --> 01:20:53.353
Yeah.

01:20:53.387 --> 01:20:54.722
She could've died.

01:21:02.429 --> 01:21:04.164
Why don't you go down
and see her?

01:21:12.172 --> 01:21:16.678
[soft music]

01:21:28.489 --> 01:21:29.423
[knocking]

01:21:29.456 --> 01:21:30.357
Come in.

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:40.167
Hey.

01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:41.435
Hey.

01:21:42.737 --> 01:21:43.738
How are you feeling?

01:21:44.438 --> 01:21:45.339
Better.

01:21:49.142 --> 01:21:50.344
What were you thinking?

01:21:52.814 --> 01:21:54.181
What were you thinking?

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:57.351
I... [sighs]

01:21:57.384 --> 01:21:58.519
Uh, okay.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.624
You almost died, is
that what you're trying to do?

01:22:02.657 --> 01:22:04.057
Are you trying...
do you wanna kill yourself?

01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:07.127
- No. I just wanted to have some fun.
- You wanted to have some fun?

01:22:07.795 --> 01:22:13.066
Just tell me what exactly was going through
your head when you pulled that stunt.

01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:18.673
You wanna turn out like me?
You wanna be a complete loser like me?

01:22:21.308 --> 01:22:22.644
No, I know you don't.

01:22:23.377 --> 01:22:24.244
[sighs]

01:22:26.346 --> 01:22:27.715
I don't know what to say to you.

01:22:27.749 --> 01:22:29.684
I don't know what to do.

01:22:30.652 --> 01:22:32.820
I get back into town,
and all of a sudden,

01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:37.157
you're drinking, you're playing games
where you pass out on the floor, I mean...

01:22:39.493 --> 01:22:41.829
Okay. [sighs]
This isn't working.

01:22:41.863 --> 01:22:43.665
This isn't working,
this is not...

01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:45.499
Cori.

01:22:48.368 --> 01:22:52.205
I love you more
than anything else in the world.

01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:58.445
And I want to be around you.

01:22:59.781 --> 01:23:02.617
And I want to be your mom.

01:23:05.552 --> 01:23:08.790
I know you can't choose in life
who's your mom and who's not,

01:23:08.823 --> 01:23:10.324
but you're stuck with me.

01:23:10.357 --> 01:23:12.292
And I'm doing
the best that I can.

01:23:15.663 --> 01:23:19.232
I have not been there for you,
and I'm sorry, honey.

01:23:35.582 --> 01:23:36.583
What's this?

01:23:38.218 --> 01:23:42.589
I don't know. It's... it's,
you know, it's from the shop.

01:23:42.624 --> 01:23:45.693
I just ran out of there
when Barbara called me,

01:23:46.593 --> 01:23:49.329
and I just felt like...

01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:51.966
I don't know.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.235
I just figured it was really
important for me to tell you

01:23:55.268 --> 01:23:58.673
that I'm sorry I haven't been
around for your last four birthdays.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:02.677
And I wanted you
to make a wish,

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:05.312
because you deserve
everything in the world.

01:24:06.346 --> 01:24:07.447
[sniffles]

01:24:07.481 --> 01:24:08.582
[blows sharply]

01:24:15.923 --> 01:24:17.859
Baby, I love you so much.

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:19.226
I love you, too.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.595
It's really good.

01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:23.330
[chuckles]

01:24:24.464 --> 01:24:26.500
Can we try to find a balance
with both of us?

01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:30.504
You don't have to be
so perfect all the time,

01:24:30.537 --> 01:24:31.973
and I don't
have to be a perfect mother,

01:24:32.006 --> 01:24:34.274
but we can
figure stuff out together.

01:24:34.776 --> 01:24:36.243
I know we can.

01:24:39.847 --> 01:24:41.248
I love you, Mom.

01:24:42.482 --> 01:24:44.251
I love you so much, honey.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.489
I'm sorry I couldn't be
there. I just...

01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:52.392
- Don't cry.
- Oh.

01:24:52.426 --> 01:24:55.529
I am happy. It's just tears
of happiness.

01:25:04.772 --> 01:25:08.943
[crickets chirping]

01:25:13.681 --> 01:25:14.849
You scared me.

01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:18.452
How is she doing?

01:25:19.319 --> 01:25:20.688
She's good.

01:25:21.388 --> 01:25:24.591
She's... she's just tired.
She's sleeping.

01:25:25.693 --> 01:25:27.394
I sang her to sleep.

01:25:28.863 --> 01:25:29.897
That's good.

01:25:30.765 --> 01:25:32.466
Mom and dad called

01:25:33.333 --> 01:25:35.903
their jackass of a lawyer,
and you're all good.

01:25:35.937 --> 01:25:38.740
They have declared you,
quote, unquote, "competent."

01:25:39.874 --> 01:25:42.242
Oh, well, nice. Yeah.

01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:47.882
So no more of that nonsense about
booting me out of this place, huh?

01:25:48.582 --> 01:25:49.516
No more.

01:25:51.986 --> 01:25:54.956
I told Cori how you used to take
me fishing when I was a kid,

01:25:54.989 --> 01:25:58.258
and she wanted to know if you'd
take her fishing some time.

01:26:00.327 --> 01:26:01.829
That would be nice.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:11.371
[soft country music]

01:26:25.953 --> 01:26:27.487
- [bell ringing]
- Oh!

01:26:48.542 --> 01:26:54.048
[birds chirping]

01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:58.085
[Walter]
I love this time of the day.

01:26:58.119 --> 01:26:59.220
[Cori] It's beautiful.

01:26:59.253 --> 01:27:04.457
I used to come out here
with your great-great granddad

01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:07.929
and your great-great-great
granddad. [chuckles]

01:27:08.729 --> 01:27:10.397
That's a lot of greats.
[chuckles]

01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:11.398
Yeah.

01:27:11.966 --> 01:27:13.167
And we sat right here.

01:27:14.869 --> 01:27:18.505
[Walter] Yeah, we used to have
a horseshoe pit over there, too.

01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:23.711
Maybe in a little while,
when the Sun goes down,

01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:27.915
we'll get a jar and catch
some fireflies maybe, huh?

01:27:27.949 --> 01:27:31.585
I'd love that. I haven't
done that in a long time.

01:27:32.419 --> 01:27:33.386
Yeah.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.890
Cori, can you come in
and set the table, hun?

01:27:35.923 --> 01:27:37.124
- [groans]
- Yeah, sure.

01:27:38.458 --> 01:27:40.728
- I'll be right back.
- Not to interrupt our stories, will ya?

01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:45.967
- I love you, grandpa.
- I love you, too.

01:27:51.973 --> 01:27:55.076
Thanks, sweetie. The casserole is in the
oven, too. So can you pull that out for me?

01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:56.878
- [Cori] Yeah.
- Thanks, dear.

01:28:13.593 --> 01:28:15.595
Looks like somebody's
been wrecked.

01:28:45.726 --> 01:28:48.461
Okay, guys, the table's set
and the food's out.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.676
[Cori sobbing]

01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:06.113
