WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.403
- MY NAME IS NATHAN FIELDER,
AND I GRADUATED FROM

00:03.437 --> 00:05.005
ONE OF CANADA'S
TOP BUSINESS SCHOOLS

00:05.038 --> 00:07.174
WITH REALLY GOOD GRADES.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.210
NOW I'M USING MY KNOWLEDGE
TO HELP STRUGGLING

00:10.244 --> 00:13.380
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MAKE IT
IN THIS COMPETITIVE WORLD.

00:21.421 --> 00:25.359
THIS IS NATHAN FOR YOU.

00:25.392 --> 00:28.095
THERE'S NOTHING PEOPLE LIKE MORE
THAN BEING SCARED.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.997
- WELL, YEAH, I LIKE MY--
- WOAH!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.231
- OH, MY GOD.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.833
- THAT'S WHY,
WHEN OCTOBER SWINGS AROUND,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.135
HAUNTED HOUSES
ARE BIG BUSINESS.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.804
BRUCE STANTON IS THE OWNER
OF REIGN OF TERROR,

00:37.838 --> 00:41.175
AN ANNUAL HAUNTED HOUSE
IN THOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.011
- WE HAVE A PERFECT ENVIRONMENT
TO SET YOU UP TO BE SCARED.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.479
- BUT AFTER TAKING
A WALK-THROUGH

00:45.512 --> 00:48.048
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY
SCARY MANSION,

00:48.081 --> 00:49.616
I CAME OUT
LESS THAN IMPRESSED.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.918
HI.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.986
SO I TALKED TO BRUCE
ONE ON ONE ABOUT AN IDEA I HAD

00:53.020 --> 00:54.488
TO HELP HIS BUSINESS.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.858
WHAT IS THE BEST PRESS
A HAUNTED HOUSE CAN GET?

00:57.891 --> 01:01.061
- THAT IT'S SO SCARY,
SOMEONE PEED THEIR PANTS.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.663
- NO.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.331
PEE IS ONE THING.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.533
I WANT YOUR HAUNTED HOUSE
TO BE SO SCARY

01:06.567 --> 01:11.505
THAT SOMEONE SUES YOU
FOR BEING TOO SCARY.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.440
- I DON'T KNOW THAT
WE WANT PEOPLE TO SUE US.

01:13.473 --> 01:16.443
- IF THE REIGN OF TERROR
WAS SUED FOR BEING TOO SCARY,

01:16.476 --> 01:18.212
THAT NEWS WOULD
ATTRACT THRILL-SEEKERS

01:18.245 --> 01:19.847
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.950
THE PLAN, GET CUSTOMERS TO SUE
BY MAKING THEM THINK

01:22.983 --> 01:25.118
THAT THEY'RE
REALLY GOING TO DIE.

01:25.152 --> 01:28.322
- NO, BECAUSE I THINK
THAT WILL BE GOING TOO FAR.

01:28.355 --> 01:32.359
- WELL, YOUR CURRENT APPROACH
COULD GET PRESS TOO.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.727
- YES.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.097
- BY BEING THE WORLD'S
LEAST SCARY HAUNTED HOUSE.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.599
- UH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE APPROACH WE WANT, BUT--

01:38.632 --> 01:39.766
- WELL, THAT'S THE APPROACH
IT SEEMS LIKE

01:39.800 --> 01:41.134
YOU'RE CURRENTLY TAKING.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.402
- NO, WE ARE A SCARY--

01:42.436 --> 01:45.105
- "REIGN OF TERROR.
WHERE PUSSIES GO TO RELAX."

01:45.138 --> 01:46.473
- OH, OKAY.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.510
- OR, "REIGN OF TERROR,
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DIE."

01:49.543 --> 01:51.845
- YOU MEAN IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
WE PAINT A PICTURE

01:51.879 --> 01:54.915
THAT THEIR DEATH IS...
IMMINENT.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.250
- YES.
- OKAY.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.418
- TO SCARE PEOPLE ENOUGH
THAT THEY WOULD SUE,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.954
I EXPLAINED TO BRUCE THAT
WE NEEDED TO CONVINCE CUSTOMERS

02:01.054 --> 02:03.390
THEY SOMEHOW CONTRACTED
A DISEASE THEY'RE LIKELY

02:03.423 --> 02:04.758
TO DIE FROM.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.394
BRUCE RELUCTANTLY AGREED
TO LET ME TRY IT OUT FOR A DAY.

02:07.427 --> 02:10.330
AND AFTER A WEEK OF PREPARATION,
MY ACTORS WERE READY.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.900
IT WAS TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER
THE WORLD'S SCARIEST

02:12.933 --> 02:14.635
HAUNTED HOUSE.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.670
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING
TO THE REIGN OF TERROR.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.272
- OH, WE'RE EXCITED, MAN.
- YOU'RE EXCITED?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.406
- YEAH, MAN.

02:19.439 --> 02:20.941
- I HAVE TO WARN YOU
BEFORE YOU GO IN.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.075
- OH, DANG.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.478
- THIS HAUNTED HOUSE
IS EXTREMELY SCARY.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.979
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.114
- YEAH.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.115
- ALL RIGHT, WELCOME
TO THE REIGN OF TERROR.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.417
- YOU FIRST.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.086
- OOH...

02:33.086 --> 02:36.089
- MOMMY.
- HELLS....

02:36.089 --> 02:37.291
- YOU'RE MY MOMMY.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.901
- SORRY, ONE SEC.
WHAT? WHO?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.703
WHO? HER?
- YEAH.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.104
- SORRY, CAN YOU
COME WITH ME FOR A SEC?

02:51.104 --> 02:52.706
SORRY, GUYS.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.908
WERE YOU GUYS SCARED IN THERE?
- YEAH.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.844
- SO SORRY, DID SHE
TOUCH YOU BY ANY CHANCE?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.111
OR WAS THERE A--

02:58.111 --> 03:00.347
- UM, I THINK SHE PROBABLY
TOUCHED MY NECK.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.348
- MOMMY!

03:03.517 --> 03:04.785
- LIKE, I USUALLY
WEAR MY GLASSES

03:04.818 --> 03:06.119
AND THIS TIME I DIDN'T,
AND I OVERSHOT THE GRAB

03:06.153 --> 03:07.754
AND I WAS SUPPOSED
TO NOT TOUCH YOU.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.822
- WAIT, SORRY, JUST--
- SORRY.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.823
- CAN YOU GUYS
WAIT IN HERE ONE SEC?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.325
- YEAH.
- SORRY, ONE SECOND.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.060
- WHAT IS IT CALLED?
- IT'S CALLED KLEIN'S DISEASE.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.228
AND IT'S AN IMMUNITY--
- KLEIN DISEASE?

03:14.261 --> 03:15.629
- KLEIN'S DISEASE.
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:15.662 --> 03:18.465
- SHE HAS AN AUTO-IMMUNE THING.

03:18.498 --> 03:19.900
SHE WORRIED WHEN
SHE TOUCHED YOU,

03:19.933 --> 03:20.901
SHE TRANSMITTED
SOMETHING TO YOU.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.102
- MM-HM.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.237
- SO DON'T GET FREAKED OUT
OR ANYTHING,

03:23.270 --> 03:24.371
BUT I CALLED AN AMBULANCE.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.739
PARAMEDICS ARE JUST
COMING TO MAKE SURE.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.674
THEY'LL LOOK AT YOU,
IT'S JUST PRECAUTIONARY.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.309
SO JUST HOLD TIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.611
- NO PROBLEM.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.346
- I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME
IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.948
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.703 --> 03:57.771
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.106
- UH, JUST IN HERE.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.541
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CUTS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.243
- I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T LOOK BACK THERE A LOT.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.313
- OKAY, DO YOU MIND
IF I JUST--

04:06.346 --> 04:09.049
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
GET HER CHECKED OUT, IF THAT'S--

04:09.049 --> 04:11.051
- YEAH.
- "CHECKED OUT" IN WHAT WAY?

04:11.051 --> 04:13.053
- LIKE, AT A HOSPITAL
WITH A DOCTOR FOR SURE,

04:13.053 --> 04:15.789
FOR KLEIN'S.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.860
- TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT'S
A DISEASE THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.062
BASICALLY, IF YOU'VE GOT A CUT,
AND YOU'RE TOUCHED,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.798
AND YOU HAVE ANY SORT
OF OPEN WOUND OR ANYTHING THAT,

04:24.831 --> 04:27.134
YOU KNOW, TOUCHED AN ORIFICE--
YOUR EYE, YOUR MOUTH,

04:27.167 --> 04:28.635
OR ANYTHING THAT'S OPEN
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.770
- JEEZ.
- YEAH.

04:29.803 --> 04:30.971
IT CAN BE CONTRACTED, SO--

04:31.071 --> 04:33.240
- IS THIS, LIKE, AIDS?
IS IT, LIKE--WORSE?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.442
- WELL, IT IS AN IMMUNE
DEFICIENCY DISEASE.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.752
- YEAH?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.525
OKAY.
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

05:02.202 --> 05:03.670
- HOW ARE WE DOING?

05:06.206 --> 05:07.608
- AT THIS TIME
IT'S A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.042
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.477
IT'S A FIRST STAGE,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU

05:10.511 --> 05:11.912
CHECKED OUT
RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.380
- ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
- YEAH.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.948
- ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
- I AM A DOCTOR, YES.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.217
I NEED HER TO COME OUTSIDE
WITH ME, AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON

05:17.251 --> 05:19.586
TO ANOTHER STAGE
WHERE THERE'S MORE DOCTORS.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.054
- WHY ARE YOU WEARING THIS SUIT?
IS IT SERIOUS?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.857
- IT'S FOR MY--YES, SIR,
IT IS SERIOUS, PLEASE.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.460
- NO! WHAT IS GOING ON?
WE ALL HAVE THIS!

05:26.493 --> 05:28.896
IF HE'S WEARING THIS,
WE ALL HAVE IT.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.697
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- WHAT IS THIS THING?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.132
- SIR--
- IT'S FOR MY SAFETY.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.901
- WHY DON'T WE
HAVE WHAT HE HAS?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
NO! WHY DOES HE
HAVE A BIOHAZARD SUIT?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.171
- NO, WAIT.
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.173
- NO, NO, NO.
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.841
SHE'S NOT GOING NOWHERE
'TILL YOU EXPLAIN, MAN,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.075
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.610
- YEAH!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.445
SHE'S NOT GOING NOWHERE.
LOOK, SHE'S TOUCHING ME.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.613
- WE'RE GONNA
WALK RIGHT OUTSIDE.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.182
LET'S WALK RIGHT OUTSIDE.
- OKAY.

05:48.215 --> 05:52.452
- I JUST WANT AN EXPLANATION,
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.087
- ALL RIGHT.
- NICE.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.493
- HOPE YOU GUYS
ENJOYED THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.662
- YOU GUYS ENJOY IT IN THERE?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.030
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
- WOW.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT?
- I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.234
- THIS RIGHT HERE IS A LAWYER.
- HELLO.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.302
- PETER--
- PETER.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.503
- PETER MARX.
- MO.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.704
- MO. AND YOU ARE?
- I'M MIRA.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.039
- MIRA.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.208
- SO IF YOU FOUND
THE HAUNTED HOUSE TOO SCARY,

06:14.241 --> 06:16.243
AND YOU WANT TO PRESS
ANY LEGAL ACTION

06:16.276 --> 06:19.346
AGAINST THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
HE CAN TALK TO YOU--

06:19.379 --> 06:21.448
- WE CAN TALK AND SEE--
UNDER THE LAW,

06:21.481 --> 06:24.084
YOU HAVE CLAIMS FOR WHAT WE CALL
"INTENTIONAL INFLICTION

06:24.117 --> 06:25.419
OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS."

06:25.452 --> 06:27.654
OR EVEN "NEGLIGENT INFLICTION
OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS."

06:27.688 --> 06:30.123
I DON'T WANT TO CREATE PROBLEMS
THAT DON'T EXIST,

06:30.157 --> 06:32.726
BUT IF YOU HAVE THOSE CONCERNS,
FEEL FREE TO CALL ME.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.061
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO,

06:34.061 --> 06:35.929
IT'S ONLY IF YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.065
- AFTER RUNNING
SEVERAL MORE CUSTOMERS

06:38.065 --> 06:39.900
THROUGH MY VERSION
OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE--

06:39.933 --> 06:41.068
- HEY, MOM, IT'S JORDAN.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.136
UM, ACTUALLY I HAVE
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.072
THERE WAS SOMEBODY
WITH A DISEASE.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
- NOW, I'M NOT TRYING
TO CREATE A LAWSUIT HERE,

06:47.140 --> 06:50.210
I JUST--YOU HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.212
- I PAID BRUCE A VISIT
TO FOLLOW UP.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.680
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.450
- WELL, I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY
IMPRACTICAL FOR A HAUNTED HOUSE.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.851
- BUT PEOPLE WERE SCARED.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.686
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW,
I COULDN'T TELL.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.154
- WE HAD A LAWYER
THERE AT THE EXIT THAT THINKS,

07:01.188 --> 07:03.824
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT HAVE A CASE.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.826
PETER?
DO YOU WANNA COME IN?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.427
- HELLO.
- HI, THIS IS BRUCE.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.263
- PETER.
- HE RUNS THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.397
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.832
SO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
HAVE A CASE, RIGHT?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.667
- WELL, SOME OF THEM
WERE A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE

07:13.700 --> 07:15.335
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE--

07:15.369 --> 07:16.637
- BUT YOU WANT TO SUE.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.072
- I WANT TO SUE FOR
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS, ABSOLUTELY.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.474
- AND THIS IS
A LEGITIMATE CLAIM?

07:20.507 --> 07:23.443
- WELL, IT COULD BE.
AND, UH, WE'LL SEE.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.479
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.813
- ALL RIGHT.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.383
- WELL, I'M GLAD I--
YOU KNOW, COULD HAVE HELPED

07:29.416 --> 07:30.951
AND DONE THIS FOR YOU.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.188
- TOOK A GOOD
HAUNTED HOUSE AND...

07:34.221 --> 07:36.156
NOT MADE IT ANY BETTER.
OKAY.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.958
- WELL, I'M TRYING
TO GET YOU PRESS.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.226
- OKAY.

07:39.259 --> 07:42.062
- IN THE END, THE SCARIEST THING
ABOUT THE HAUNTED HOUSE

07:42.062 --> 07:43.931
WAS BRUCE'S TERRIBLE MANNERS.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.134
BUT WHEN SOMEONE'S RUDE TO YOU,
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.169
YOU JUST HAVE
TO KEEP GOING.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.307
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME,
YOU PROBABLY SEE A GUY

07:54.341 --> 07:56.009
WHO HAS IT ALL.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.745
BUT REALLY, THERE'S A LARGE
PART OF ME THAT'S IMMATURE

07:58.779 --> 08:00.347
AND UNDER-DEVELOPED.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.684
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO WOMEN.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.353
EVERY GIRL I LIKED GROWING UP
REJECTED ME.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.455
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
I'VE GROWN INTO A MAN

08:08.488 --> 08:11.358
WHO'S CHRONICALLY
NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.527
I'M AN EMOTIONAL MIDGET.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.529
NOW, IF SOMEONE CAME TO ME
WITH THIS PROBLEM,

08:15.562 --> 08:18.732
I'D SUGGEST IMMERSION THERAPY,
WHERE YOU OVERWHELM YOURSELF

08:18.765 --> 08:22.169
WITH YOUR FEAR IN ORDER
TO OVERCOME IT.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.071
SO TONIGHT,
TO INSPIRE YOU,

08:24.104 --> 08:27.641
I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME
MY FEAR OF THE OPPOSITE SEX

08:27.674 --> 08:32.179
BY DATING NOT ONE,
BUT TEN WOMEN AT THE SAME TIME.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.182
WISH ME LUCK.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.085
I NEEDED TO GET TEN WOMEN
TO AGREE TO DATE ME,

08:38.118 --> 08:39.619
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY
TO START WITH SOMEONE

08:39.653 --> 08:40.986
I WORK WITH.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.289
SO...

08:42.322 --> 08:44.691
YOU KNOW HOW I'M DOING
THE THING ON THE SHOW

08:44.725 --> 08:48.328
WHERE I'M DATING, LIKE,
TEN WOMEN AT THE SAME TIME?

08:48.362 --> 08:49.463
- YEAH.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.098
- ARE YOU IN A RELATIONSHIP
RIGHT NOW?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.733
- YES.
- OKAY.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.867
- UM...

08:53.900 --> 08:56.570
- SO--SORRY, NEVER MIND.
I WAS STUPID TO ASK.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.839
IT DIDN'T WORK,
AND I KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE

08:58.872 --> 09:00.841
THAT WOMEN JUST WOULDN'T
STOP AND TALK TO ME

09:00.874 --> 09:02.376
WITHOUT AN EXCUSE.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.244
SO I FOUND ONE.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.380
EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TRY OUR NEW

09:06.413 --> 09:08.982
BLUEBERRY-RASPBERRY SMOOTHIE?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.384
COME ON, JUST ONE?

09:10.417 --> 09:11.418
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
ONE OF OUR NEW

09:11.451 --> 09:14.488
RASPBERRY-BLUEBERRY SMOOTHIES?

09:14.521 --> 09:15.789
UH, I'M JUST
KIDDING, ACTUALLY.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.925
I DON'T WORK HERE.
MY NAME'S NATHAN.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.261
I'M JUST DOING THIS
AS A WAY TO BREAK THE ICE

09:21.261 --> 09:22.596
AND SHOW MY PERSONALITY.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.797
- OH.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.266
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO MEET PEOPLE AND--

09:26.266 --> 09:28.068
NO.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.372
I'M JUST DRINKING
MY OWN SMOOTHIE

09:32.406 --> 09:35.509
THAT I BOUGHT FROM HERE.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.812
BUT I LIKE DRINKING MY SMOOTHIE
OUT OF LITTLE CUPS ON A TRAY.

09:38.845 --> 09:43.016
THAT'S HOW I LIKE
TO DRINK MY SMOOTHIE.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.052
OKAY, WELL I THINK I'M ALLOWED
TO DRINK MY SMOOTHIE

09:45.085 --> 09:46.053
WHEREVER I WANT.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.056
- YOU NEED TO MOVE THIS.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.290
- HEY!
- YOU NEED TO MOVE THIS.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.893
- YOU CANNOT TOUCH MY TRAY,
THAT IS CRAZY.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.462
THE SMOOTHIE THING
WAS TOO GIMMICKY ANYWAYS,

09:55.495 --> 09:57.764
AND IT FELT THE SAME WAY
WHEN I USED A CUTE DOG.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.933
DO YOU LIKE MY DOG?
- YEAH.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.436
- SAY HI.
- HI.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.004
- BUT JUST WHEN
I WAS READY TO QUIT,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.138
IT HIT ME.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.240
I HAD A MAJOR GIRL MAGNET
AT MY DISPOSAL

10:07.274 --> 10:10.310
THAT I WAS TOTALLY IGNORING.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.779
A TELEVISION CREW.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.915
IT WAS A CRAZY IDEA,
BUT MAYBE WOMEN WOULD DATE ME

10:14.948 --> 10:17.651
JUST FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
TO BE ON TV.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.252
I HAD MY SOLUTION.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.588
I WAS GOING TO CREATE
A FAKE REALITY SHOW

10:21.621 --> 10:24.991
IN WHICH TEN WOMEN WOULD VIE
FOR THE HEART OF ONE MAN.

10:25.025 --> 10:25.992
ME.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.495
IT WOULD BE CALLED
THE HUNK.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.630
IT TOOK WEEKS TO PREPARE
AS WE SORTED THROUGH

10:30.664 --> 10:33.667
THE COUNTLESS SUBMISSIONS
FROM WOMEN TO MY ONLINE AD.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.068
OH, I LIKE HER.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.372
BUT PRETTY SOON WE SELECTED
THE TEN WOMEN I WOULD NEED,

10:38.405 --> 10:41.575
HIRED A HOST,
AND RENTED A MANSION.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.344
NO ONE KNEW MY SHOW
WAS FAKE, NOT EVEN THE HOST.

10:44.378 --> 10:47.848
AND IT WAS
ABOUT TO BEGIN.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.049
- I'M ANTHONY NAPOLI.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.085
TONIGHT, TEN WOMEN
WILL GATHER IN THIS HOUSE

10:52.119 --> 10:54.488
TO VIE FOR THE HEART
OF ONE MAN.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.958
WILL THEY FIND LOVE?
WILL THEY FIND THEIR SOUL MATE?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.595
I'M ANTHONY NAPOLI.
THIS IS THE HUNK.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.820
- HI.
- YOU READY, NATHAN?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.589
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, I THINK SO.

11:29.623 --> 11:33.126
- A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS?
- UM, KINDA, YEAH.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.895
- WELL, IT'S TIME
TO MEET THE WOMEN.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.496
- WHERE--WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:36.530 --> 11:37.964
- I'M GONNA STAND HERE,
AND I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU

11:37.998 --> 11:39.599
TO ALL THE WOMEN.

11:39.633 --> 11:43.170
- COULD YOU MAYBE,
UM, BE INSIDE FOR THAT?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.604
- I'LL HAVE--

11:44.638 --> 11:46.006
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
VERY HANDSOME COMPARED TO ME.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.507
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, NATHAN--
- COULD YOU BE INSIDE?

11:47.541 --> 11:48.942
- I'LL HAVE TO BE HERE.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.310
- IF YOU'RE NEXT TO ME,

11:50.344 --> 11:51.678
THEY'RE GONNA
LOVE YOU MORE THAN--

11:51.712 --> 11:53.647
- NATHAN, YOU'RE THE HUNK,
I'M THE HOST.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.383
- WOMEN MUST LOVE YOU, RIGHT?
- EH...

11:56.416 --> 11:57.751
- YES?
- I GUESS THEY DO.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.386
- HOW MANY WOMEN
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

11:59.419 --> 12:00.754
- EH...

12:00.787 --> 12:01.922
NOT THAT MANY.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.990
- HAVE YOU EVER HAD A THREESOME?
- I HAVE, YES.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.660
- OKAY, SO--YEAH,
GO INSIDE, PLEASE.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.395
- WOULD YOU--YOU WOULD
LIKE ME TO STEP INSIDE?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.330
- YEAH. YOU CAN'T
BE OUT HERE AT ALL.

12:10.364 --> 12:11.598
- NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, CAN YOU GO INSIDE?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.700
- SURE.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.236
I REALIZED TOO LATE
THAT HIRING A HANDSOME HOST

12:16.269 --> 12:17.971
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.507
BUT EVEN WITH TONY IN THE HOUSE,
WHEN THE WOMEN ARRIVED,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.810
I GOT SUPER-NERVOUS.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.551
- HI, I'M EMILY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.420
- OH, NATHAN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.023
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEAH.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.091
- SO EXCITING.
- YEAH. IT IS, HUH?

12:38.125 --> 12:41.661
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.563
- THIS IS FUN.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.965
- YEAH.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.368
- YEAH.
- TOTALLY, UM...

12:48.402 --> 12:51.004
- UM...

12:51.038 --> 12:52.906
- IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEAH, OKAY.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.241
- THANKS.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.043
- UM, DO YOU WANT TO GO--
WE COULD TALK MORE AFTER.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.210
- YEAH, SURE.
- YEAH, JUST--

12:57.210 --> 12:58.245
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.713
- FOR THE FIRST BIT,
JUST SAYING HI.

12:59.746 --> 13:00.781
- YEAH.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.749
- EVEN THOUGH
I WAS NERVOUS AT FIRST--

13:02.783 --> 13:04.217
- I LOVE A MAN
IN A GOOD SUIT.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.218
- OH, OKAY.
- MM-HM.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.353
- THAT'S NICE.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.754
AS I MET MORE AND MORE
OF THE WOMEN,

13:07.788 --> 13:09.556
I FOUND MY CONFIDENCE GROWING.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.458
WE HAVE SNACKS INSIDE
AND STUFF, TOO.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.126
WE EAT PRETTY GOOD.
- AWESOME.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.629
- THIS WAS ALL SO COOL, 'CAUSE
IT WAS JUST LIKE THE BACHELOR.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.131
- I REALLY LIKE GUYS WHO HAVE
BLACK HAIR AND WHITE SKIN.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.300
IT'S, LIKE, MY--
- YOU DON'T LIKE, UH--

13:20.333 --> 13:22.269
- BLONDS?
- LIKE BLACK GUYS, OR--

13:22.302 --> 13:25.972
- UM, I JUST--

13:26.006 --> 13:28.275
- WELL, WE'LL TALK MORE INSIDE.
- OKAY.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.377
- I HAD NEVER HAD THIS MUCH
ATTENTION IN MY LIFE,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.646
AND THE ONLY THING
I HAD TO DO TO ATTRACT THEM

13:32.679 --> 13:34.314
WAS TO CREATE A FAKE SHOW.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.249
THE LOGIC DIDN'T
REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME,

13:36.249 --> 13:37.417
BUT IT WAS WORKING,

13:37.451 --> 13:39.453
AND I WAS GONNA
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

13:39.486 --> 13:42.489
TO TRY TO GET OVER
MY NERVOUSNESS AROUND WOMEN.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.466
- LADIES...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.101
I'M YOUR HOST,
ANTHONY NAPOLI.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.137
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE
TO MINGLE AND GET TO KNOW

13:57.170 --> 14:00.440
YOUR HUNK, NATHAN.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.609
- ARE YOU GONNA GO UP THERE?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.043
WHERE YOU GONNA BE?

14:04.077 --> 14:05.712
- YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE AGAIN?
- YEAH.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.680
MAYBE GO INTO THE ROOM?
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

14:07.714 --> 14:09.415
- NO.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.750
- YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE THE ROOM AGAIN?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.652
- YEAH.
- UP HERE?

14:12.685 --> 14:16.289
- SURE.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.999
- ALL RIGHT.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.102
LET'S GET THIS
PARTY STARTED, HUH?

14:30.637 --> 14:31.971
- YES! OH!
- OHH.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.573
all: OHH...

14:35.108 --> 14:36.543
- WHAT DID YOU GUYS
THINK OF THE HOST?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.244
HE WAS SAYING HE HAD
A THREESOME--HE WAS SAYING.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.446
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.648
- REALLY?
- YEAH, WITH TWO GUYS.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.850
- WITH TWO GUYS?
- YEAH.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.185
I'M, LIKE, "OKAY,
THANKS FOR TELLING ME THAT.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.086
I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO KNOW."

14:47.120 --> 14:48.421
- YEAH.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.589
- I MEAN--
- SO WEIRD.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.357
- I WAS HAVING FUN
DATING ALL THE WOMEN.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.427
BUT I BEGAN TO FIND IT HARD
TO TELL IF THEY REALLY LIKED ME

14:54.461 --> 14:57.597
OR HAD OTHER MOTIVATIONS
FOR BEING HERE.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.332
- WELL, I'M WORKING
ON MY ALBUM RIGHT NOW.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.800
MY CHRISTIAN MUSIC ALBUM.
- OKAY.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.903
- YEAH.
- CAN I HEAR A SONG OR...

15:03.937 --> 15:06.573
- ♪ PEOPLE MAKE IT SEEM

15:06.606 --> 15:10.643
♪ THAT EVERYONE IS COOL

15:10.677 --> 15:13.780
♪ WITH BEING ALONE

15:13.813 --> 15:16.783
MY ALBUM IS COMING OUT
THIS YEAR, SO...

15:16.816 --> 15:17.951
MY NAME IS L.A.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.919
MY ALBUM IS GONNA
BE CALLED L.A.X.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.921
AND IT'S GONNA
BE COMING OUT THIS YEAR.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.590
MY TWITTER IS @LA--

15:23.623 --> 15:25.825
- AND I WAS SOON REMINDED
THAT MOST OF THESE GIRLS

15:25.859 --> 15:27.961
WERE JUST HERE
TO BE ON TV.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.363
SO I TRIED MY BEST
TO FIND OUT HOW THESE WOMEN

15:30.363 --> 15:31.898
TRULY FELT ABOUT ME.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.399
DO YOU LIKE ME?

15:33.433 --> 15:38.505
- YEAH.
- UM, DO YOU LOVE ME?

15:38.538 --> 15:41.374
OH, GOD!
I CAN'T--THAT'S SUCH--

15:41.374 --> 15:42.776
HOW CAN I TELL THE FIRST--

15:42.809 --> 15:46.513
UH, LOVE, I NEED TO LEARN
THE PERSON FIRST OF COURSE.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.781
YEAH.

15:47.814 --> 15:52.585
- I MEAN, I'D HATE
TO ELIMINATE YOU SO SOON.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.588
SO MAYBE I SHOULD ASK AGAIN.
- OH, DO I LOVE YOU?

15:55.622 --> 15:56.723
- YEAH.
- I LOVE YOU.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.324
- BUT YOU DO?
- I DO.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.860
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S A REALLY NICE PERSON.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.830
BUT, YEAH,
I LOVE HIM, SO...

16:03.863 --> 16:05.965
- BUT AS THE NIGHT WENT ON,
I REALIZED IT DIDN'T MATTER

16:05.999 --> 16:07.467
WHY THEY WERE HERE.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.402
WE WERE BOTH
GETTING WHAT WE WANTED.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.704
I GOT TO WORK THROUGH
MY NERVOUSNESS AROUND WOMEN--

16:11.738 --> 16:14.874
SORRY, I'M KIND OF SHAKING.
- DON'T BE NERVOUS.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.076
DON'T BE NERVOUS,
THAT'S SO CUTE.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.646
- AND THEY
GOT TO BE ON TV.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.850
- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE EVERYONE
INTRODUCED TO KANGEN WATER.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.619
THIS WATER IS ONE OF
THE BEST WATERS OUT THERE.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.122
IT HAS A PH OF 9.5.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.690
- I'D NEVER BEEN
THAT GOOD OF A FLIRT,

16:30.723 --> 16:33.093
BUT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PRACTICE WITH SO MANY

16:33.126 --> 16:34.928
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

16:34.961 --> 16:38.364
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL EYES
AND BEAUTIFUL LIPS,

16:38.364 --> 16:43.002
AND LOVELY HAIR,
AND YOUR STYLE IS...

16:43.036 --> 16:44.737
WONDERFUL.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.341
- OH...THANKS, NATE.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.713
- SO TELL ME YOUR
DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRET.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.650
- MY DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET IS...

17:10.130 --> 17:12.965
I DON'T LIKE WEARING SOCKS.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.901
- THAT'S GREAT.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.336
BUT AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSED...

17:16.336 --> 17:18.003
- OH, COOL.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.239
- MAGIC.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.674
MY FLIRTING SKILLS
DRASTICALLY IMPROVED.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.609
- DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES?
I MEAN--

17:23.643 --> 17:28.114
- I DON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
BUT I AM A BIT OF A BAD BOY.

17:28.147 --> 17:31.017
BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED.

17:35.550 --> 17:38.720
- I LIKE MOTORCYCLES, ACTUALLY.
DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES?

17:38.750 --> 17:43.760
- I DON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
BUT I AM A BIT OF A BAD BOY.

17:45.090 --> 17:46.660
OH, OKAY.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.400
THAT MIGHT BE JUST--
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN TALKING

17:49.430 --> 17:50.660
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

17:50.700 --> 17:55.100
WE MIGHT BE MOVING JUST
A LITTLE BIT FAST FOR ME.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.010
I JUST PREFER TO TAKE
THINGS A LITTLE SLOWER.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.680
MM, NO.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.150
IT'S STILL TOO SOON.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.790
WE NEED TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.
WE JUST MET.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.960
- IT'S OKAY.

18:15.990 --> 18:18.460
- IN THAT MOMENT,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.460
I WASN'T READY TO MOVE
AS QUICK AS SHE WAS,

18:20.490 --> 18:24.500
BUT I FINALLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS
LIKE TO HAVE A WOMAN COME TO ME.

18:24.530 --> 18:26.630
I REALIZED I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO CRAZY STUNTS

18:26.670 --> 18:30.670
TO GET WOMEN TO LIKE ME,
I JUST HAD TO BE MYSELF...

18:30.710 --> 18:33.040
INSIDE A $5,000-PER-NIGHT
MANSION

18:33.070 --> 18:35.310
WITH A TV CREW FILMING ME.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.180
BUT FOR A GUY LIKE ME,
WHO'S GONE THROUGH

18:37.210 --> 18:39.310
AN ENTIRE LIFETIME
OF REJECTION,

18:39.350 --> 18:42.320
KNOWING THAT I WAS DESIRABLE
WAS ALL I NEEDED TO NO LONGER

18:42.350 --> 18:44.490
BE NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.290
I HAD ACCOMPLISHED MY GOAL.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.690
SO I GATHERED ALL THE WOMEN
TO TELL THEM

18:48.720 --> 18:50.120
THAT THE SHOW WAS OVER.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.760
I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MY GOAL,
AND THAT MEANS UNFORTUNATELY

18:53.790 --> 18:57.470
THERE'S NO LONGER A REASON
FOR THIS SHOW, THE HUNK,

18:57.500 --> 19:00.000
TO CONTINUE.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.400
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.210
- QUESTION.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.640
SO YOU REALLY--
YOU REALLY--

19:08.680 --> 19:11.110
UM, DID YOU GET YOUR--

19:11.150 --> 19:12.350
YOU GOT--
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED

19:12.380 --> 19:13.880
FROM DATING ALL THE GIRLS?

19:13.910 --> 19:15.150
YOU GOT YOUR FEAR MET?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.950
- UM, I THINK--

19:16.980 --> 19:19.290
I THINK IT HELPED ME
OVERCOME IT, YES.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.860
WHY?

19:20.890 --> 19:22.620
- I'M JUST WONDERING.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.230
- BUT OTHERS
WERE HAPPY FOR ME.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.730
THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.730
- I HAD ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT I SET OUT TO DO,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.330
BUT THERE WAS STILL
ONE THING I HAD TO MAKE RIGHT.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.200
EARLIER, TONY SHARED
A PERSONAL STORY WITH ME.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.640
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A THREESOME?
- I HAVE, YES.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.870
- AND I ACCIDENTALLY
TOLD IT TO SOME OF THE WOMEN.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.340
HE WAS SAYING HE HAD
A THREESOME WITH TWO GUYS.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.880
- WITH TWO GUYS?
- YEAH.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.580
AND NOW I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.380
I'M REALIZING NOW,
PERHAPS IT WAS WRONG

19:47.420 --> 19:52.150
TO BRING UP TONY'S
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HE HAD

19:52.190 --> 19:54.660
IN THE COMFORT OF HIS OWN HOME
WITH TWO MEN.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.760
- I ALREADY HEARD THE STORY.
- YEAH. YEAH, THE THREESOME.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.600
- HIM WITH TWO GUYS?
- YEAH.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.500
- OH, BUT NOT
WITH TWO GUYS.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.930
- WELL, WAS IT
ONE GUY, ONE GIRL?

20:04.970 --> 20:07.600
OR WAS IT TWO GIRLS?
- NAH.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.240
- WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?
- EXACTLY. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.640
- AND EVEN IF HE DID,
IT'S HIS OWN BUSINESS.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.880
- YEAH, WE DON'T CARE.
- YEAH, WE DON'T CARE.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.210
- YEAH.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.380
- SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT,

20:19.410 --> 20:21.680
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY HARD FEELINGS--

20:21.720 --> 20:24.250
- NO HARD FEELINGS.
- BETWEEN US.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.790
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.460
- YOUR FEARS ARE ALL GONE?

20:28.490 --> 20:31.190
- HE'S A GREAT GUY.
HE REALLY IS.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.890
- FROM WHAT
YOU KNOW OF.

20:32.930 --> 20:34.760
- OH, YOU'RE NOT?
- NO, I'M A GREAT GUY.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.100
- WHY'D YOU SAY,
"FROM WHAT YOU KNOW OF"?

20:36.130 --> 20:37.370
- WELL, FROM
WHAT YOU KNOW OF ME.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.800
- YEAH, BUT I JUST
CALLED YOU A GREAT GUY.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.030
WHY ARE YOU
ARGUING AGAINST THAT?

20:40.070 --> 20:41.740
- ARE YOU A GOOD GUY?

20:41.770 --> 20:45.440
- AS THE WOMEN WERE LEAVING,
I FELT CONFIDENT IN MYSELF,

20:45.470 --> 20:47.410
KNOWING THAT IF I EVER
WANTED TO FIND LOVE--

20:47.440 --> 20:48.780
THANK YOU.

20:48.810 --> 20:52.350
I COULD JUST CREATE A FAKE
REALITY SHOW ALL OVER AGAIN.
