00:01.167 --> 00:03.828
<i>Well, one of the funner</i>
<i>things that we do here in Pawnee</i>

00:03.903 --> 00:06.064
<i>is the annual</i>
<i>Easter egg hunt.</i>

00:06.139 --> 00:10.508
<i>Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say</i>
<i>he did an exceptional job this year.</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:13.239
I've been searching for 25 minutes
and I haven't found a single egg.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.371
And I'm an adult.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.711
Oh. Yeah,
I forgot to do that.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.414
<i>Maybe Tom's trying to</i>
<i>make this year a challenge.</i>

00:19.486 --> 00:21.886
<i>And if so,</i>
<i>he's succeeding.</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:24.681
<i>I don't think a single</i>
<i>egg has been found yet.</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:27.556
Let's keep looking.
We're gonna find one.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.154
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to see my mom.</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:03.855
<i>She's a big mucky-muck in</i>
<i>the county school system.</i>

01:03.930 --> 01:06.160
<i>She's my hero.</i>
<i>How do I explain her?</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:09.759
She's as respected
as Mother Teresa.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.770
She's as powerful as Stalin,

01:11.838 --> 01:14.773
and she's as beautiful
as Margaret Thatcher.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.100
In or out, Leslie.
Doorway is creepy.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.270
Right, sorry.
Choosing in.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.477
So, what do you
want, Leslie?

01:21.548 --> 01:24.745
Just here to gossip,
gab, chat, stuff we do.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.150
But it looks like you're super busy,
and I am super busy,

01:27.220 --> 01:29.552
so I shall
bid you adieu.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.852
Oh. That's weird.
I just remembered something.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.361
I have my own
subcommittee now.

01:37.363 --> 01:40.764
Yeah. I'm sure you've heard something
about it. People are talking about it.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.233
No.
Oh. Well.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.930
Anyway, we're having a town hall
meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.904
At the Smithfield Community Center.
Mmm.

01:46.973 --> 01:49.441
Yeah, I'm leading it.
It's no biggie.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.737
I mean, it is.
It's a big deal.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.210
I mean, I don't know.
You know...

01:54.614 --> 01:56.104
You want to come?

01:56.182 --> 01:58.673
Oh. Honey, jeez.
You know how busy I am.

01:58.751 --> 02:02.209
I know. I know. I know!
That's why I fake invited you.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.554
I'll try to be there.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.490
Okay. So, everybody's here.
Let's get started.

02:09.562 --> 02:10.586
Ow!

02:10.663 --> 02:13.632
Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Metal.
Sorry. That's really loud.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.635
Subcommittee members.
Are we prepared for tomorrow night?

02:16.703 --> 02:18.728
Tom, have you booked the hall yet?
Yes, sir.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.170
Ann, did you clear
your schedule?

02:20.240 --> 02:22.071
- I did. I changed my shift.
- Okay.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.700
Leslie, I just have to say,

02:23.776 --> 02:27.109
I think you might be taking this to
the public a little bit too soon.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.478
It literally doesn't matter
what you propose to the public.

02:29.549 --> 02:32.313
They might call for a vote, and if
they vote you down, then you're done.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.114
I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.645
I have a secret
weapon, canvassing.

02:38.091 --> 02:41.527
Nothing better than good old-fashioned
door-to-door campaigning.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.619
I'm not above
using my expertise

02:43.696 --> 02:46.893
to change hearts and minds
if the cause is just.

02:47.534 --> 02:51.493
When I was in sixth grade,
I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.832
And there were only
63 people in my class.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.802
Andy fell into that pit.
I fell into that pit.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.073
How many more Pawnee citizens are
gonna have to fall into that pit

03:02.148 --> 03:05.584
before we turn it into a park?
Zero. Say it.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.676
Zero.
Zero.

03:06.753 --> 03:07.742
A hundred.
Zero.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.085
I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.749
Tom, you probably
won't need any.

03:12.825 --> 03:16.090
Uh... And this is
our canvassing guide.

03:16.162 --> 03:20.258
This is gonna be the script that
we use when we speak with people.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.801
"If a person is a man,
turn to page two."

03:22.869 --> 03:26.464
"If the person looks like a
celebrity, example, Jack Nicholson,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.029
"use this to
help your pitch.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.473
"Example, 'Y ou can't
handle the pit.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.011
"'T hat's why we need to
turn it into a park.'"

03:35.315 --> 03:36.805
Oh. This is
really thorough.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.578
Ann and I are a team.
You guys are a team.

03:38.651 --> 03:42.087
We have even sectors, you guys have
odd sectors. And we're gonna win.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.747
Yeah.
Win what?

03:44.791 --> 03:45.815
Go!

03:48.895 --> 03:51.693
Okay.
Ooh, someone's in there.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.459
This is gonna be fun.
Are you excited? Excited, yeah.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.591
Are you ready?
Yes, definitely.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.656
Are you pumped up?
Yes!

03:55.735 --> 03:57.965
Look humble.
But confident.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.374
Good afternoon. We are representatives
from your local government.

04:03.443 --> 04:06.105
May we speak with you for a moment
about the Sullivan Street pit?

04:06.179 --> 04:07.168
Sure.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.976
Excellent!
Positive response.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.720
How would you feel if we turned that
pit into a beautiful community park?

04:14.787 --> 04:16.652
Oh. Yeah.
That'd be a great idea.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.588
Oh. Good.
I actually live in the neighborhood

04:18.658 --> 04:20.558
So I could probably
tell you a little bit about...

04:20.627 --> 04:22.652
That's... Go to section three.
Okay.

04:22.729 --> 04:26.995
Um... We are having a
public forum tomorrow night.

04:27.066 --> 04:31.332
And it would be great if you could come,
voice your strong support.

04:31.404 --> 04:33.895
Tomorrow? I can't.
I'm busy. Sorry.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.497
Oh. Yes, we understand
that people are busy,

04:35.575 --> 04:37.202
but we would love for you to
come to the meeting and to...

04:37.277 --> 04:39.472
Sorry. Good luck, though.
I'm all for a park.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.012
Would it change your mind
if we told you that...

04:41.080 --> 04:42.172
She's gone.

04:42.248 --> 04:44.773
Yeah, a park, huh?
That sounds like a really good idea.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.945
Great. Would you be willing to come to
a town meeting and show your support?

04:48.021 --> 04:51.388
Absolutely. Now, is this park
gonna have a playground or,

04:51.457 --> 04:52.924
you know, maybe
a pool for the kids?

04:52.992 --> 04:55.085
Oh, how old
are your kids?

04:55.662 --> 04:56.651
No kids.

04:56.729 --> 04:57.787
Uh-oh.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.729
I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
Don't do that.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.666
Also, is the park gonna be at
least 1,000 feet from my house?

05:02.735 --> 05:04.862
Because, you know,
I really can't move again.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.996
April,
please stand behind me.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.802
That's it. That's all.
That's all we've got.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.467
- No flier?
- Nope.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.671
Okay.
Thank you.

05:17.016 --> 05:20.611
Wow, man. This is great.
This is so great. I love canvassing.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.279
What a great way
to spend my time.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.653
All right, Team Haverford.
You guys are awesome,

05:24.724 --> 05:28.353
but I think I might work
better as a solo artist.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.658
So, I'm gonna
head out. Peace.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.800
He runs weird.
He really does.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.806
It's a good idea.
But I'm just not sure.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.372
Okay. Which part are
you not sure about?

05:45.445 --> 05:47.310
Turning the pit
into a park.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.780
That's kind of
the whole thing.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.878
Well, look, I think this is a great
idea, but I can't make any forum.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.147
I would have to
get a babysitter.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.711
How old are your kids?

05:56.789 --> 05:58.154
Four and two.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.522
Could the 4-year-old watch
the 2-year-old? Okay.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.893
Mickey! What's up, buddy?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.555
How's my number one
sod man doing?

06:05.631 --> 06:07.656
Look, here's the one, two,
three of the situation.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.497
One, we're building
a new park,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.230
two, I'm on
the committee,

06:11.304 --> 06:13.169
three, you're
putting in the sod.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.729
And who knows, you know?
Maybe, down the line,

06:14.807 --> 06:16.331
a situation will arise
where you could hook me up.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.274
Are you gonna commit to coming
to this meeting tomorrow,

06:18.344 --> 06:19.402
or are you gonna
be a bitch?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.310
Yes, you do owe me.

06:21.681 --> 06:22.739
Tom Haverford.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.373
Okay. Keep going,
keep moving.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.179
Nose to the grindstone.
No means yes.

06:26.252 --> 06:29.187
Can we stop, please?
Because it's really hot, and I'm tired.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.950
Yeah, I'm hot, too.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.389
Let's blow on
each other's faces.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.520
Or we could
drink some water.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.721
Yeah, let's do that.

06:36.796 --> 06:40.596
My house is really close by. Let's
just go take a break for an hour or so.

06:40.666 --> 06:43.260
Okay, okay. Look, I didn't want
it to have to come to this,

06:43.336 --> 06:47.466
but, Ann, please open the sealed
envelope that's in your binder.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.235
This is a little something
I learned from Karl Rove.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.940
If you want to guarantee
the results of a survey,

06:56.015 --> 06:59.507
you design the question to give
you the answer that you want.

06:59.585 --> 07:04.181
"Wouldn't you rather have a park than
a storage facility for nuclear waste?"

07:04.257 --> 07:05.315
That seems iffy.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.120
Yeah, don't worry about it,
I made it all up.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.524
Yeah, that's what I mean.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.825
Wouldn't you agree,
like most decent Americans,

07:11.898 --> 07:13.331
that it would
be a good idea

07:13.433 --> 07:15.401
to turn the abandoned
lot on Sullivan Street

07:15.468 --> 07:17.663
into a beautiful
community park?

07:17.737 --> 07:20.638
Oh. Actually, no.
I'm not really a fan of parks.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.197
Very noisy,
barbecue smell all the time.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.640
Would you change your
mind if I told you that

07:26.712 --> 07:29.806
nine out of 10 meth users
said the same exact thing?

07:29.882 --> 07:32.942
What?
How would you even know that?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.219
Survey. We surveyed
crystal meth users.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.420
We're actually having a little
town meeting tomorrow night

07:41.494 --> 07:43.792
if you wanted to just... Look,
I know it sounds weird,

07:43.863 --> 07:45.922
but I just don't like
living near parks.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.866
So if you have a flier or something,
I'd be happy to take it.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.865
Thank you.
Okay.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.275
You don't care about your kids
if you don't support this park!

07:57.343 --> 07:58.674
Excuse me?

07:59.579 --> 08:04.016
It's... What I mean is,
kids love parks and you should, too.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.983
So, if I don't support
your little project,

08:06.052 --> 08:07.644
then I don't love
my daughter?

08:07.720 --> 08:08.778
I didn't...

08:08.855 --> 08:09.947
What time is
this thing, anyway?

08:10.022 --> 08:11.080
Oh, it's next month,
forget about it.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.591
Oh, it's tomorrow night.
I'll be there.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.752
Great. Okay.
Come on.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.193
We got one.
Come on.

08:18.931 --> 08:22.799
Am I talking to the two
sexiest thighs in landscaping?

08:22.869 --> 08:24.268
Yes, I am, 'cause
I'm talking to Marcy.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.929
How's it going?
Tom Haverford.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.805
Kevin, your sandboxes are the best.
That's why I want you involved!

08:29.876 --> 08:31.844
I just want the best monkey
bars I can get in my park.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.275
I don't mind
hooking you up.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.144
Maybe, down the line, there'll be a
situation where you can hook me up.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.671
Thank you for
your time, sir.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.914
Hmm, he said some
upsetting things.

08:41.988 --> 08:44.081
I can't believe you gave
him your home phone number.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.216
Well, I'm a public servant.
I need to be accessible.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.056
What the hell is
wrong with people?

08:49.128 --> 08:50.993
I should show them
Andy's medical bills.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.826
Maybe they'd have
a little sympathy.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.231
Oh, my God. Ann!
Game changer.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.632
You just busted
the game wide open.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.226
How?
Andy.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.999
We need Andy.
He's our symbol.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.597
We'll wheel him around the
neighborhood to get sympathy.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.303
He's a cute FDR.
Yeah! Yeah!

09:07.513 --> 09:08.775
Ron, you got a minute?

09:08.848 --> 09:10.440
Uh, sure, Paul.
What can I do for you?

09:10.516 --> 09:13.849
The Sullivan Street Park project.
You fast-tracked it, right?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.151
Yeah, absolutely.
We have a public forum tomorrow.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.248
Okay. Great.
I'll be there.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.759
Great.

09:22.662 --> 09:26.393
Mmm. "Hey!
You fast-tracked that, right?"

09:27.099 --> 09:29.863
I'm sorry?
Did you say something?

09:32.104 --> 09:34.470
Nope.
You didn't say anything to me?

09:34.540 --> 09:35.632
Nope.

09:37.877 --> 09:41.938
There's a new wind blowing in
government and I don't like it.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.440
All of a sudden, there's all
this federal money coming in,

09:45.518 --> 09:49.682
and Paul, the city manager,
is telling us to build parks

09:49.755 --> 09:52.417
and start new community programs.
It's horrifying.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.285
Do you have, like,
a nurse's costume? Costume?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.022
You mean, like, scrubs?
Yeah, put those on.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.120
Okay.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.392
<i>Please tell me</i>

10:00.466 --> 10:05.199
<i>Please tell me why</i>

10:05.638 --> 10:07.799
<i>My car is in the front yard</i>

10:07.873 --> 10:08.897
<i>Bass! Come on.</i>

10:08.975 --> 10:14.572
<i>And I'm sleeping</i>
<i>with my clothes on</i>

10:14.647 --> 10:18.947
<i>I came in through</i>
<i>the window last night</i>

10:27.226 --> 10:29.217
It can be tricky dealing... Don't...

10:29.929 --> 10:31.897
<i>Why do I want to</i>
<i>build this park so bad?</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:33.989
<i>Maybe because a pit</i>
<i>filled with garbage</i>

10:34.066 --> 10:36.296
<i>isn't the best that</i>
<i>we can do in America.</i>

10:36.369 --> 10:40.271
You know, in Russia,
they could pretend that pit was a park,

10:40.339 --> 10:42.398
bring their kids
down there.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.035
"Hey, Vlad!
Look at these rocks!

10:45.111 --> 10:46.908
"Let's pretend
they're potatoes!"

10:46.979 --> 10:50.346
"Nikolai! Do you want
to swim in the dirt?"

10:51.751 --> 10:55.346
But not here. Okay?
'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.

10:55.421 --> 10:58.754
And it is my dream
to build a park.

11:00.726 --> 11:04.560
That I one day visit with my
White House staff on my birthday.

11:05.598 --> 11:09.466
And they say, "President Knope,
this park is awesome.

11:10.736 --> 11:15.105
"Now we understand why you are the first
female President of the United States."

11:21.914 --> 11:25.850
Leslie Knope, builder of parks.
How was canvassing?

11:25.918 --> 11:27.977
Canvassing was okay,

11:28.788 --> 11:32.451
but I think we're gonna have
to postpone the town meeting.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.816
Postpone?

11:34.894 --> 11:37.158
Only for one to 90 days.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.892
No. You're doing this meeting.
You have my full support.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.459
I was talking to the city manager,
exchanging ideas.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.665
Um, there's
a mutual respect there.

11:47.740 --> 11:52.006
And together, we have decided
to fast-track your project.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.239
City manager?
Wow. Really?

11:54.814 --> 11:56.042
I have to cancel
this meeting.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.948
Fast-track?
Did my name come up at all?

11:59.018 --> 12:00.508
Oh, this meeting
needs to be canceled.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.178
No, it's happening.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.451
Look, just do a good job
tomorrow. Okay?

12:05.524 --> 12:07.287
We have to push
this thing through.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.519
Of course.
Of course.

12:08.594 --> 12:11.222
I'll push anything through anything.
You know me.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.594
Are you sweating
through your suit?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.656
I doubt it. It's a very
breathable fabric...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.031
Oh, yeah. I am.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.270
Jerry,
what's up, man?

12:19.338 --> 12:20.430
Hey, you're into
pretzels, right?

12:20.506 --> 12:21.837
Bam!
Hit them up, man.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.034
Thanks for coming down. I got a
seat taped off for you over there.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.271
My top priority with this park,
getting your fences in there.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.437
I drove by one of your
fences the other day.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.641
I was like, "Man, that fence looks
awesome." I was like, of course, Roy's.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.014
If you're into chocolate muffins,
grab as many you want.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.316
<i>Some people may say that bringing</i>
<i>in these contractors this early</i>

12:36.388 --> 12:37.787
is jumping the gun
a little bit.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.757
Well, guess what?
Here's the gun, here's me.

12:39.825 --> 12:40.849
Boom!

12:40.926 --> 12:44.020
Victor Miles.
Tom Haverford. How are you?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.358
Thank you so much
for coming down.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.991
I want to introduce
you to Leslie.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.329
Victor Miles.
Hi.

12:49.401 --> 12:50.868
He's a gentleman
I met canvassing.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.564
He also happens to be the
top sod guy in Indiana.

12:53.639 --> 12:54.936
That's terrific.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.998
Hey, Leslie. Hey.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.504
I really want
you to nail this.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.445
Don from Don's Cement.
Tom Haverford. Good to see you.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.813
I was thinking of a jingle
for your company. How's this?

13:04.884 --> 13:08.081
<i>Don's cement</i>
<i>It's the best you can get</i>

13:08.154 --> 13:09.143
<i>Don's</i>

13:09.355 --> 13:11.152
I'm so glad
you're here.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.054
Yeah. Andy came, too,
to give his support.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.150
I have a lot of
stage experience, so...

13:15.227 --> 13:16.319
This will
be fine, right?

13:16.395 --> 13:17.453
It's a park
for God's sakes.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.588
How much can
they hate a park?

13:18.664 --> 13:20.256
A lot of them seemed to
hate a park yesterday.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.493
April.
April, I need you in the audience. Okay.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.503
Wait, and if the questions start
getting negative, I'm gonna call on you.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.062
And I need you to sell the crap
out of the park. Can you do that?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.506
Why? Please, April!
This is serious!

13:30.576 --> 13:32.066
Can you do that?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.168
Probably.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.406
Good girl, good girl,
good "probably."

13:35.481 --> 13:38.109
Good girl. Okay, here we go.
Line up, everybody.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.652
My mom's here.
My mom's here.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.884
My mom's here.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.259
No. I can't do that.
That's illegal.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.358
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for coming out tonight.</i>

13:53.432 --> 13:56.890
<i>This is our first town</i>
<i>meeting about the proposal</i>

13:56.969 --> 14:00.496
<i>to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan</i>
<i>Street into a community park.</i>

14:03.242 --> 14:04.334
<i>Yeah!</i>

14:05.010 --> 14:07.240
This is gonna be
a train wreck.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.213
I want my
daughter to be successful,

14:09.281 --> 14:11.146
which is why I
always tell her,

14:11.217 --> 14:13.447
"There's nothing wrong
with being a wife and mother."

14:13.719 --> 14:16.381
<i>Now, there are many</i>
<i>people that I spoke to</i>

14:16.455 --> 14:19.754
<i>who are passionately</i>
<i>in support of this idea.</i>

14:19.825 --> 14:22.589
<i>None of them were able to make</i>
<i>it tonight, unfortunately.</i>

14:22.661 --> 14:27.223
<i>But they totally exist.</i>
<i>I did not make them up.</i>

14:27.900 --> 14:30.596
<i>Oh, I see a question.</i>
<i>Okay. No, no.</i>

14:30.669 --> 14:32.569
<i>No. No questions</i>
<i>right now.</i>

14:32.638 --> 14:34.538
<i>My name is Kate Spivack.</i>
<i>Mmm-hmm. I remember you.</i>

14:34.607 --> 14:36.404
<i>And I live in</i>
<i>the neighborhood.</i>

14:36.475 --> 14:40.104
<i>And I am 100%</i>
<i>against this park.</i>

14:40.512 --> 14:43.072
<i>I cannot believe the department</i>
<i>is moving forward with a project</i>

14:43.148 --> 14:45.742
<i>without a single</i>
<i>environmental impact study,</i>

14:45.818 --> 14:49.049
<i>and if you guys agree with me,</i>
<i>let's take a stand.</i>

14:52.491 --> 14:53.515
<i>Okay.</i>

14:57.296 --> 14:59.560
<i>We are a little</i>
<i>ahead of schedule,</i>

14:59.632 --> 15:02.931
<i>because we're holding this</i>
<i>town hall meeting so soon,</i>

15:03.002 --> 15:05.800
<i>which I was warned about</i>
<i>by Mark Brendanawicz,</i>

15:05.871 --> 15:08.066
<i>our city planner</i>
<i>assigned to this project.</i>

15:08.674 --> 15:11.734
<i>Uh... So what would he say?</i>

15:14.380 --> 15:16.109
<i>Here we are.</i>

15:16.181 --> 15:20.242
Leslie, should I give
them some background info on the site?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.780
Absolutely. Okay.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.187
<i>Mark Brendanawicz knows the</i>
<i>answer to every question.</i>

15:25.257 --> 15:27.817
<i>He's amazing and congratulations</i>
<i>for hearing him speak.</i>

15:28.994 --> 15:31.929
<i>Hi there. Leslie might have</i>
<i>oversold me a little bit.</i>

15:31.997 --> 15:33.555
<i>Certainly did not.</i>
<i>He's the man.</i>

15:33.699 --> 15:35.257
<i>He's capable of anything.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

15:35.868 --> 15:39.269
<i>Lot 48 is...</i>
<i>It's a rectangular lot.</i>

15:39.338 --> 15:42.933
<i>It's got excellent drainage. And it's</i>
<i>on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.</i>

15:43.742 --> 15:44.766
<i>Any questions?</i>

15:44.843 --> 15:47.277
I have more of a comment
than a question. <i>Go for it.</i>

15:47.346 --> 15:48.813
It's for the guy
in the casts.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.314
Here we go, Lawrence.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.179
Yes. Yes. Yes.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.548
<i>That is Andy Dwyer.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:57.350
<i>He is a local resident and he</i>
<i>tragically fell in the pit.</i>

15:57.423 --> 15:59.914
Uh, yeah. I don't
care about any of that.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.187
He's the guy that plays music
all night in his garage.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.819
It's driving me nuts.

16:03.896 --> 16:07.297
Lawrence lives
with his grandma.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.001
Which is pretty awesome.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.127
He takes care
of her, I guess.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.330
But whatever,
he's a douchebag.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.698
It's loud, it's abusive,
and it's waking up my birds.

16:16.775 --> 16:18.436
You have birds, now?

16:18.510 --> 16:22.002
Yeah, I have birds.
I have nice, pretty, expensive birds,

16:22.081 --> 16:23.912
and you play that music,
and it wakes them up.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.917
Look, I don't work for
the government, okay?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.782
Uh, I do play
rock and roll.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.014
Guilty as charged.
I'm in a band.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.083
It's called Just the Tip.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.320
And actually, if anyone here plays bass,
we need a bassist.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.022
<i>Yes. Okay, let's take a</i>
<i>five-minute break, shall we?</i>

16:39.932 --> 16:43.390
Uh. It is not going well at all.
Mmm-hmm.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.835
It's going very poorly.
Okay? Mmm-hmm.

16:46.405 --> 16:47.895
Like, you're
crashing and burning.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.099
Democracy's happening.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.507
People are talking. I mean,
at least they aren't apathetic, right?

16:52.578 --> 16:55.012
You're right about that.
They're deeply negative.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.741
You need to put
a happy face on this,

16:56.815 --> 16:58.749
give me a few positive talking points,

16:58.817 --> 17:01.251
and whatever you do,
avoid a vote.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.885
I'm oddly attracted
to Kate Spivack.

17:12.998 --> 17:17.958
<i>Before we continue, I'd love to just</i>
<i>give you a little history of Pawnee.</i>

17:18.037 --> 17:21.494
<i>The City of Pawnee</i>
<i>was incorporated in 1817,</i>

17:21.573 --> 17:25.406
<i>when a young man by the name</i>
<i>of Reverend Luther Howell</i>

17:25.477 --> 17:27.944
<i>came from Terre Haute</i>
<i>on an ox.</i>

17:28.012 --> 17:30.072
<i>He planted his flag</i>
<i>in the ground</i>

17:30.149 --> 17:34.848
<i>and was met soon after by an</i>
<i>angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians,</i>

17:35.387 --> 17:39.687
<i>who, when seeing the whiteness of</i>
<i>his skin, twisted him to death.</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:43.153
<i>Flash forward to 1969.</i>

17:43.228 --> 17:45.389
<i>Man walks on the moon.</i>

17:45.464 --> 17:47.489
<i>Pawnee is lousy</i>
<i>with hippies...</i>

17:47.566 --> 17:51.161
My, God.
She's filibustering her own meeting.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.635
Filibuster!

17:52.704 --> 17:53.728
Boom!

17:53.806 --> 17:55.535
They can't touch you
if you talk forever.

17:55.607 --> 17:58.906
<i>I can't speak of</i>
<i>the future, but I will.</i>

17:58.977 --> 18:03.004
<i>The future of Pawnee will involve</i>
<i>us flying around in space taxis,</i>

18:03.449 --> 18:06.247
<i>where we will</i>
<i>communicate on watches,</i>

18:07.486 --> 18:12.219
<i>and blink our feelings to each other,</i>
<i>rather than use words.</i>

18:12.958 --> 18:15.552
<i>And now, I'd like to</i>
<i>take a magical journey</i>

18:15.627 --> 18:19.222
<i>through a little something I like
to call</i> The Phantom Tollbooth,

18:19.298 --> 18:20.629
<i>by Norton Juster.</i>

18:20.699 --> 18:23.190
Excuse me? Can't you read that
children's book on your own time?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.895
<i>I have the floor!</i>

18:28.107 --> 18:29.438
<i>"There once was</i>
<i>a boy named Milo,</i>

18:29.508 --> 18:31.738
<i>"who didn't know what to do with</i>
<i>himself, not just sometimes, but..."</i>

18:31.810 --> 18:34.404
Okay, all right. You know what?
This is a public forum,

18:34.480 --> 18:37.347
which means that we all get
to tell you what we think.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.850
<i>Well, you did</i>
<i>already talk, ma'am.</i>

18:39.918 --> 18:43.081
<i>And I would love to listen to</i>
<i>someone else. Someone I don't know.</i>

18:43.155 --> 18:46.420
<i>Uh... That girl over there with the</i>
<i>long brown hair and the yellow top.</i>

18:46.492 --> 18:49.222
<i>Could you tell us how</i>
<i>you feel about this park?</i>

18:49.294 --> 18:50.818
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

18:52.197 --> 18:57.965
<i>Uh, I'm a youth in the community and</i>
<i>I think a new park is a great idea.</i>

18:58.537 --> 19:02.234
<i>And I fully support it, as would the</i>
<i>rest of the youth in the community.</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:05.333
Hey! I recognize her.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.037
That kid came to
my door yesterday.

19:07.112 --> 19:10.912
Oh, my God! Okay, they have
planted people in this audience.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.348
Unbelievable!

19:12.417 --> 19:14.647
You know what? We all agree
that this park is a bad idea.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.449
We should just take a vote.
Right? WOMAN: Yeah.

19:16.522 --> 19:17.580
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>we will take a vote.</i>

19:17.656 --> 19:19.886
<i>Before we do that,</i>
<i>I want everyone up,</i>

19:19.958 --> 19:21.118
<i>lined up behind</i>
<i>that microphone,</i>

19:21.193 --> 19:23.423
<i>and I want to hear from all of you.</i>
<i>One by one.</i>

19:23.495 --> 19:24.689
<i>That was brutal.</i>

19:24.763 --> 19:27.561
<i>A couple of weeks ago, I was</i>
<i>yelling at Leslie at a public forum.</i>

19:27.633 --> 19:29.931
<i>God, I hope I wasn't</i>
<i>as obnoxious as those people.</i>

19:31.670 --> 19:33.262
I wasn't, right?

19:33.505 --> 19:36.872
<i>At 5:00 in the morning,</i>
<i>every morning, beep, beep, beep!</i>

19:36.942 --> 19:39.536
<i>I don't want to hear that. Now, how</i>
<i>long is this project gonna take?</i>

19:39.611 --> 19:41.909
<i>That's what I want to know.</i>
<i>That's what's important to me.</i>

19:41.980 --> 19:43.174
<i>Because I need my sleep.</i>
<i>I put some...</i>

19:43.248 --> 19:44.943
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

19:45.017 --> 19:46.314
<i>That concludes</i>
<i>our meeting.</i>

19:46.385 --> 19:47.511
What about the vote?

19:47.586 --> 19:50.214
<i>We're out of time.</i>
<i>It's 9:00.</i>

19:50.322 --> 19:53.382
<i>But we will have many</i>
<i>public forums in the future,</i>

19:53.458 --> 19:56.484
<i>and we hope to see you all there.</i>
<i>Thank you so much for coming.</i>

20:09.074 --> 20:10.541
<i>It was tough.</i>

20:10.609 --> 20:13.806
<i>But, you know, that's Pawnee.</i>
<i>That's democracy.</i>

20:13.879 --> 20:15.938
<i>There are a lot of people</i>
<i>here that want this park.</i>

20:16.014 --> 20:19.643
You just gotta get past the
negative people. But guess what?

20:19.718 --> 20:22.744
My subcommittee held its first
town hall meeting tonight.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.121
God, I loved it!

20:26.325 --> 20:28.156
I loved every minute of it.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.729
Hey, park lady.
Yeah?

20:31.797 --> 20:33.059
You suck.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.995
Hear that?
He called me "park lady."

20:41.373 --> 20:43.967
You know, normally, I don't
agree with Leslie about anything,

20:44.042 --> 20:46.340
but this book
is awesome.
