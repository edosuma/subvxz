00:12.701 --> 00:15.534
This was the last model
the Soviets produced.

00:15.601 --> 00:17.434
Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

00:17.501 --> 00:18.667
Yes.

00:18.734 --> 00:20.834
<i>So, in a little less
than an hour</i>

00:20.901 --> 00:22.501
it will detonate

00:22.567 --> 00:24.767
and strike a blow that the
Americans will never forget.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.033
When you're finished,
meet me at the safe house.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.634
<i>WALID:
I think some people
in this place have a connection</i>

00:29.701 --> 00:31.234
with the
terrorist attacks.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.501
<i>How would you know that?</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.200
There was one phrase they used
several times.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.801
<i>"Khamsa ziwar."</i>

00:38.868 --> 00:40.367
Pass that on to the FBI.

00:40.434 --> 00:42.467
I've just approved the written
agreement with Assad.

00:42.534 --> 00:44.167
I am prepared to offer you
full protection

00:44.234 --> 00:45.968
and a pardon for all crimes
or acts

00:46.033 --> 00:47.067
of war in the past.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.367
Is that acceptable to you?

00:48.434 --> 00:50.534
<i>I need to see this pardon
in writing.</i>

00:50.601 --> 00:52.300
CHLOE:
Jack, you were right about
Curtis and Assad

00:52.367 --> 00:53.601
having a past connection.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.434
Curtis was in the Army just
after Desert Storm.

00:55.501 --> 00:58.200
<i>His squad was ambushed
by Assad's people.</i>

00:58.267 --> 01:00.234
They killed five of Curtis' men
and took

01:00.300 --> 01:01.634
two more hostage.

01:01.701 --> 01:04.132
Assad's lieutenant personally
beheaded them both.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.400
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:06.467 --> 01:08.000
You still don't remember?

01:10.300 --> 01:11.834
Special forces battalion.

01:13.701 --> 01:14.968
Curtis, put your weapon down!

01:15.033 --> 01:16.601
Stay out of this, Jack!

01:16.667 --> 01:18.000
I can't.

01:18.067 --> 01:20.667
I gave him my word
that we would protect him.

01:20.734 --> 01:23.467
I can't let
this animal live.

01:23.534 --> 01:24.901
(gunshot)

01:26.667 --> 01:28.934
BUCHANAN:
Curtis didn't leave you
any choice, Jack.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.234
That's what I keep trying
to tell myself.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.634
We're going to find that
suitcase nuke

01:32.701 --> 01:33.701
because of you, Jack.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.534
Tell the President I'm sorry.

01:35.601 --> 01:38.267
I can't do this anymore.

01:38.334 --> 01:39.501
Mr. President,

01:39.567 --> 01:41.901
we believe we found
the suitcase nuke.

01:41.968 --> 01:44.100
<i>CHLOE:
The tac team is ready.</i>

01:52.701 --> 01:54.367
No...!

02:01.334 --> 02:03.067
I just got a message
from the FBI.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.200
It's some Arabic phrase.

02:05.267 --> 02:07.868
<i>Khamsa ziwar.
It means "five visitors."</i>

02:07.934 --> 02:11.200
Assad said "visitor"
was a code word for "weapon."

02:11.267 --> 02:13.033
Four more of these things
out there.

02:25.467 --> 02:29.434
TV REPORTER:
These are the first images from
the latest terrorist attack

02:29.501 --> 02:30.834
here in Valencia.

02:30.901 --> 02:35.300
The devastation, I've never
seen anything like it.

02:35.367 --> 02:38.167
This is as close as we can get
at this time.

02:38.234 --> 02:40.334
because of the radiation
dispersal.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.701
Judging from the direction of
the smoke, the wind

02:43.767 --> 02:46.300
seems to be blowing towards
the northwest

02:46.367 --> 02:48.300
and away from populated areas,

02:48.367 --> 02:51.901
which is about the only
good news we have so far.

02:51.968 --> 02:54.400
My God.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.801
How many people
died in this?

02:57.868 --> 02:59.501
Initial estimates:

02:59.567 --> 03:01.534
no less than 12,000.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.200
Mr. President,

03:09.267 --> 03:12.033
I just got off the phone
with Bill Buchanan at CTU.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.334
He has intel that four more

03:13.400 --> 03:15.200
tactical nuclear weapons
were stolen

03:15.267 --> 03:17.300
along with the one
that went off.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.100
Do we have any idea
where they are?

03:19.167 --> 03:21.567
We do not.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.834
I want a meeting with the Joint
Chiefs, Tom, right away.

03:23.901 --> 03:25.200
I've already let them know.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.701
Has civilian air traffic
been shut down?

03:26.767 --> 03:28.200
Yes. The FAA

03:28.267 --> 03:30.334
gave the order as soon as they
were informed about the bomb.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.567
Mr. President,

03:32.634 --> 03:34.567
given the current situation,

03:34.634 --> 03:36.834
we've decided to move
you down to the bunker.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.167
All right.

03:38.234 --> 03:40.701
But, Tom, I have to get in front
of the American people.

03:40.767 --> 03:42.634
Ellen, I want to make
a televised speech

03:42.701 --> 03:44.634
within the hour.
Yes, sir.

03:44.701 --> 03:46.200
All right, let's go, Dan.
Sir.

04:02.734 --> 04:05.567
ANNOUNCER:
The Department of Emergency
Services and Public Safety

04:05.634 --> 04:08.767
have urged everyone to return
home and stay there.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.968
Attempting to leave the city
is actually more dangerous.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.968
Nadia, have we heard from
any of the secondary teams

04:15.033 --> 04:16.334
that were converging
on Fayed?

04:16.399 --> 04:18.601
No, we lost communication
as soon as the blast hit.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.200
Milo, can you get a visual?

04:20.267 --> 04:22.434
I just checked the satellite.
All...

04:22.501 --> 04:24.801
All of our field teams were
too close to ground zero.

04:24.868 --> 04:25.868
They're all dead.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.567
Morris, what was the last thing
you heard from them?

04:30.634 --> 04:32.167
They were engaged with
the hostiles.

04:32.234 --> 04:33.934
Which means they were
closing in on Fayed.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.934
We need to know if
he was in the radius

04:36.000 --> 04:38.033
when the bomb
went off.
Absolutely.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.033
Mr. President,

04:40.100 --> 04:41.801
your office
has been prepared.

04:41.868 --> 04:44.801
The continuity of operations
plan has also been activated.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.467
The Vice President
has been alerted

04:46.534 --> 04:48.100
and is following protocol.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.434
The Joint Chiefs and most

04:49.501 --> 04:51.367
of the cabinet members
are on their way here.

04:51.434 --> 04:52.901
The remaining
cabinet members

04:52.968 --> 04:54.400
are being routed to Site-R.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.133
Right this way, sir.

05:10.934 --> 05:12.968
(telephone rings)

05:13.033 --> 05:14.033
Yeah?

05:14.100 --> 05:15.067
Bill?

05:15.133 --> 05:16.234
Are you all right?

05:16.300 --> 05:17.534
We're upwind of the blast.

05:17.601 --> 05:18.934
We're fine.
What's going on over there?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.434
The Secret Service moved us
down to the bunker

05:21.501 --> 05:23.200
and the President is about
to meet with the Joint Chiefs.

05:23.267 --> 05:24.400
Do you have anything new?

05:24.467 --> 05:25.934
Here's what we know:

05:26.000 --> 05:28.601
The bomb went off
as we were moving in
on Fayed's safe house.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.334
Do you think their presence
prompted the detonation?
It could have.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.667
It's possible they were just
prepping the bomb in Valencia

05:33.734 --> 05:35.934
and hoping to move it
to a more populated area.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.601
Is there any chance that Fayed
could still be alive

05:38.667 --> 05:40.334
and have those four other bombs?

05:40.400 --> 05:41.634
We don't know.

05:41.701 --> 05:43.167
We're running the intel now.

05:43.234 --> 05:44.234
What about Assad?

05:44.300 --> 05:45.734
He's on his way here.

05:45.801 --> 05:47.434
We're hoping he can
help us find Fayed.

05:47.501 --> 05:49.133
All right, keep me
in the loop.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.501
And, Bill,
please be careful.
I will.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.367
It's a lot to process.

06:01.434 --> 06:03.634
So many people.

06:03.701 --> 06:05.801
Yeah.

06:05.868 --> 06:08.534
And Curtis...
I can't believe this.

06:08.601 --> 06:11.133
I know you and he were friends.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.167
Why do people I know keep dying?

06:17.567 --> 06:19.133
Did you find anything out
about Fayed?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.267
No, we're still
positioning satellites.

06:21.334 --> 06:22.300
We don't know
where he is yet.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.467
(sighs)

06:23.534 --> 06:24.734
We've got massive
packet loss.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.868
Do you want to help me
boot up routers?

06:26.934 --> 06:28.067
Who wouldn't?

06:33.167 --> 06:34.100
Open etudes five.

06:34.167 --> 06:35.334
Okay.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.534
I just have a really bad
feeling about everything.

06:38.601 --> 06:40.534
Did you know Jack quit?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.868
Yeah, Buchanan said

06:41.934 --> 06:43.801
he's off channel.
What's that all about?

06:43.868 --> 06:46.501
I'm sure it's because
he was forced to kill Curtis.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.334
You know I'm here for you,

06:54.400 --> 06:56.267
right?

06:56.334 --> 06:58.968
Yeah, I do.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.434
(sirens blaring)

07:13.300 --> 07:15.801
(screaming)

07:21.334 --> 07:23.000
(tires screech)

07:33.000 --> 07:35.167
The authorities
discovered our location.

07:35.234 --> 07:36.968
The bomb never reached
its target.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.801
Damn it, Fayed.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.033
I sold those weapons to you.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.667
The least you could've done
was warn me

07:41.734 --> 07:43.400
before you blew them up
in my city.

07:43.467 --> 07:46.367
I told you it was not supposed
to happen the way it happened.

07:46.434 --> 07:48.300
Little late for apologies,
don't you think?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.367
My engineer died
in the blast.

07:50.434 --> 07:52.133
The device used to
reprogram the trigger

07:52.200 --> 07:53.334
was destroyed as well.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.534
And that's
my problem, why?

07:54.601 --> 07:56.133
I have four more bombs
whose triggers

07:56.200 --> 07:57.968
need to be made operational.

07:58.033 --> 07:59.801
Sorry, Fayed.

07:59.868 --> 08:01.567
I'm going to Vegas.

08:01.634 --> 08:03.133
Find me a way, McCarthy.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.667
I'll pay you more.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.934
Double the amount from
our previous transaction.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
That's interesting.

08:10.067 --> 08:13.434
You need someone who can
replicate what that device did

08:13.501 --> 08:15.133
with modern equipment.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.567
We're talking
pretty advanced stuff.

08:16.634 --> 08:18.100
I'd have to do
some checking.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.767
Do you know someone
who can do this?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.067
Even if I found someone
who can, I doubt they will.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.334
This is over the line.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.667
I don't care how you
get them to comply.

08:26.734 --> 08:29.501
I need someone within
the next few hours.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.334
Are you in or not?

08:31.400 --> 08:33.267
I'll do some research and
get back to you.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.433
(screaming)

08:47.200 --> 08:49.000
Help!
Somebody, help!

08:49.067 --> 08:51.634
Look, I can't
get through to 911!

08:51.701 --> 08:53.000
Would you help?!

08:53.067 --> 08:54.467
I need a doctor!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.133
I need a doc... I need a doctor!

08:56.200 --> 08:57.934
I... I need a doctor!

08:58.000 --> 09:00.133
Please, our helicopter,
it went down.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.701
And there are two others:
one's dead,

09:01.767 --> 09:03.501
one's unconscious.
I don't know what to do. Please!

09:03.567 --> 09:05.801
Please help me.
Show me.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.167
I don't even remember anything
hitting us.

09:15.234 --> 09:16.801
Things just went out of control.

09:16.868 --> 09:18.167
You were hit by
a shockwave.

09:18.234 --> 09:19.701
A shockwave of what?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.667
Nuclear bomb.

09:21.734 --> 09:23.501
What?

09:23.567 --> 09:25.033
What are you talking about?

09:35.868 --> 09:37.634
(people screaming)

09:44.033 --> 09:46.701
(sirens wailing)

09:49.300 --> 09:50.667
Can you hear me?

09:50.734 --> 09:52.901
Can you hear me?

09:52.968 --> 09:54.200
Chuck, is that you?
Yeah, yeah, I brought help.

09:54.267 --> 09:55.734
We're gonna get you
out of there.

09:55.801 --> 09:57.701
(creaking)
Careful,
it's about to fall.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.501
It's jammed.

10:14.133 --> 10:14.934
(grunts)

10:17.434 --> 10:19.367
(Jack panting)

10:20.400 --> 10:21.968
You ready?

10:22.033 --> 10:23.834
One, two,

10:23.901 --> 10:26.100
(helicopter creaking)
three, go!

10:35.667 --> 10:37.901
Stay here.

10:37.968 --> 10:39.868
(sirens wailing)

10:39.934 --> 10:41.467
Are you okay?

10:41.534 --> 10:43.200
I think so.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.934
(panicked screams in distance)

10:50.167 --> 10:52.334
(screams continue)

10:52.400 --> 10:54.234
This guys says
it's a nuclear bomb.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.567
That's Valencia--
that's where I live.

10:55.634 --> 10:56.968
My wife and kids are there.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.200
I got to go...
You can't go back
to Valencia.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.300
The radiation will kill you.

11:00.367 --> 11:02.400
Jeff, don't! You'll die!

11:02.467 --> 11:04.934
This is Jack Bauer.
Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.200
If you want to save your friend,
don't let him go back home.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.434
Jack, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:10.501 --> 11:11.467
Where are you?

11:11.534 --> 11:12.734
I'm still in Granada Hills.

11:12.801 --> 11:14.267
Good. You're upwind
of the blast.

11:14.334 --> 11:16.501
Don't go any further north.
How bad is it?

11:16.567 --> 11:18.067
It took out a one-mile radius.

11:18.133 --> 11:20.300
Do we know if this was
Fayed's endgame?

11:20.367 --> 11:22.801
It wasn't-- there are
four more nukes out there.

11:22.868 --> 11:24.501
You need to pick me up.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.167
You said you were out.

11:26.234 --> 11:28.467
Not after this.

11:28.534 --> 11:29.801
All right.
Tell me where you are.

11:29.868 --> 11:31.300
I'll send a car.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.400
I'm on the corner
of Glasgow and 15th.

11:50.201 --> 11:52.867
--Colonel, Fayed has to be at
least partially state-supported.

11:52.934 --> 11:54.767
Have your guys
identified a country?

11:54.833 --> 11:56.000
Not yet, sir.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.900
Uh, CIA has narrowed down
the list.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.467
It's on your screen
in the short

11:59.534 --> 12:01.067
brief section.
Have you been in touch

12:01.134 --> 12:02.467
with the ambassadors
of these countries?

12:02.534 --> 12:03.501
Yes, sir.

12:03.568 --> 12:05.167
They all extend
their condolences

12:05.234 --> 12:08.501
and have, of course, disavowed
any role in the attacks.

12:08.568 --> 12:11.134
Well, we know at least
one of them's lying.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.234
Maybe all of them.

12:13.301 --> 12:15.467
I'm not sure
we know that, John.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.534
But let's say it is true--
what are you suggesting?

12:19.100 --> 12:22.534
We have carriers on standby
in the Persian Gulf.

12:22.601 --> 12:24.800
They have the capability
of striking multiple targets

12:24.867 --> 12:26.234
in each of these states.

12:26.301 --> 12:28.401
We've been playing games
with these terrorists

12:28.467 --> 12:29.967
for 11 weeks now.

12:30.034 --> 12:32.267
The only language
they understand is force.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.534
So let's speak it to them
real clearly.

12:34.601 --> 12:36.067
I guarantee
you that if

12:36.134 --> 12:37.634
each of these countries
had to sustain

12:37.700 --> 12:40.301
three major metropolitan nuclear
strikes, they'd no longer

12:40.367 --> 12:43.568
have the time or the resources
to play in our sandbox anymore.

12:43.634 --> 12:45.767
These people want to live
in the Stone Age--

12:45.833 --> 12:47.301
I say let's put them there.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.201
Admiral, I am very sure
that your emotions

12:50.267 --> 12:52.534
are shared by many in this room

12:52.601 --> 12:54.434
and across
this country...
These are not just emotions.

12:54.501 --> 12:57.434
Our duty demands we defend...
The President is talking,
Admiral.

12:57.501 --> 12:58.700
Do not interrupt.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.234
We will retaliate, Admiral.

13:04.301 --> 13:06.668
But we will do so,
sir, carefully

13:06.733 --> 13:10.100
and with our sights locked
on our enemy and only our enemy.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.700
Karen, what has CTU learned
about the remaining weapons?

13:14.767 --> 13:17.601
They're assessing
the initial satellite intel

13:17.668 --> 13:19.367
<i>and forensic data.
So what do we know?</i>

13:19.434 --> 13:21.401
We're assuming that
the bomb was meant

13:21.467 --> 13:23.967
to be detonated
in a more populated area

13:24.034 --> 13:26.401
and was only being assembled
in Valencia.

13:26.467 --> 13:29.367
By the scientist
that I released.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.934
Yes.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.767
The scientist was killed
in the blast, and CTU

13:33.833 --> 13:36.733
is trying to determine
where Fayed was at the time.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.434
The worst-case
scenario

13:38.501 --> 13:40.201
is that he is still alive

13:40.267 --> 13:42.568
and in possession of
the remaining nuclear weapons.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.100
(exhales)

13:56.167 --> 13:59.034
Tell them we're safe.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.568
That we're moving away
from it now.

14:09.534 --> 14:10.867
(exhales)

14:16.700 --> 14:21.334
Mr. Buchanan, this
is Hamri Al-Assad.

14:21.401 --> 14:24.167
Mr. Buchanan's
Director of CTU.

14:25.668 --> 14:30.401
Mr. Buchanan, I know that
you see me as your enemy.

14:30.467 --> 14:32.501
But today...

14:32.568 --> 14:35.034
I assure you I am not.

14:46.568 --> 14:48.534
Follow me.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.100
There. All right?

14:54.167 --> 14:56.434
Why are we going out of our way
treating Assad,

14:56.501 --> 14:58.668
one of the most violent
terrorists of our time,

14:58.733 --> 15:00.000
like a VIP?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.201
No holding room.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.767
Audience with the White House?
Sure.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.234
How would you like
your mineral water,

15:04.301 --> 15:06.534
Mr. Assad, room temp?

15:17.967 --> 15:19.601
Please have a seat.

15:27.534 --> 15:28.867
Ready?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.634
Bill Buchanan,
Director of CTU, Los Angeles.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.900
I'm here with

15:33.967 --> 15:35.601
Hamri Al-Assad.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.501
Less than 30 minutes ago,
Abu Fayed detonated

15:37.568 --> 15:38.934
a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.934
We have reason to believe
he's still

15:41.000 --> 15:43.234
at large with four more
tactical nuclear weapons

15:43.301 --> 15:44.700
in his possession.
Four?

15:44.767 --> 15:45.833
That's right.

15:45.900 --> 15:46.967
Please,

15:47.034 --> 15:48.934
you must understand.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.534
<i>I came to the United States
to stop Fayed-- I knew</i>

15:51.601 --> 15:53.534
he intended to inflict
damage, but I did not know

15:53.601 --> 15:55.301
he was in possession
of nuclear weapons.

15:55.367 --> 15:56.634
But he is.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.234
Which means there
has to be a trail.

15:59.301 --> 16:01.967
There had to have been
many people involved
in the planning of this.

16:02.034 --> 16:03.067
This attack was planned

16:03.134 --> 16:05.034
after Fayed betrayed me
six monthsago.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.100
When he learned of
your intention to
broker a peace plan?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.568
Which I still intend to do.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.767
But you knew Fayed
was coming to the
United States.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.434
This information came to me
only days before

16:15.501 --> 16:17.534
the first attacks began.
From whom?

16:17.601 --> 16:20.000
I am a well-informed man,
Mr. Buchanan.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.301
Are there any other
paths you can think of

16:24.367 --> 16:26.467
that can lead
us to Fayed?
Yes.

16:27.634 --> 16:28.668
The source.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.634
The source of the bomb.
About a year ago

16:30.700 --> 16:33.100
I sent Fayed to negotiate
with an ex-Soviet general

16:33.167 --> 16:35.167
about the cache
of tactical nuclear weapons.

16:35.234 --> 16:37.000
But there was no
transaction at the time.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.601
What was the name
of the general?

16:38.668 --> 16:39.967
Dmitri Gredenko.

16:40.034 --> 16:41.867
Can you tell me anything
about Gredenko?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.267
Nothing. Nothing.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.601
I've never met the man.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.800
Continue questioning him.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.501
I'm gonna check this out.

16:50.067 --> 16:51.501
Gredenko.
You got that, Chloe?

16:51.568 --> 16:53.401
Yeah, I'm opening
a Russian database now.

17:04.867 --> 17:07.767
--Wait a minute, what about
this file here with
Gredenko's name on it?

17:07.834 --> 17:09.700
It's a link we're using
as a match basis, Milo.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.468
Mind your own business.
I know, I understand that.

17:11.532 --> 17:12.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.633
I just compiled a list of names,
people in L.A.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.532
who had contact with Gredenko

17:17.599 --> 17:20.733
on business channels.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.334
That's a lot of names.
Yes. But one of them

17:23.401 --> 17:26.567
kind of floated to the top,
if you know what I mean.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.633
Put it on Buchanan's screen.

17:33.101 --> 17:35.134
Wow.

17:35.201 --> 17:37.134
Yes, yes,

17:37.201 --> 17:38.500
they'll fly him up.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.001
All right.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.734
Morris just put something
on your B window.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.633
Gredenko contacts. Good.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.067
Look at number 17.

17:49.134 --> 17:53.700
Chairman of BXJ Technologies.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.468
Phillip Bauer.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.800
Jack's father.

18:00.401 --> 18:01.834
Did you get anything
more specific?

18:01.900 --> 18:04.334
No. BXJ does a lot of business
in Eastern Europe.

18:04.401 --> 18:06.700
This could be a purely
coincidental linkage.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.633
Yeah, what if it's not?
Most of their

18:08.700 --> 18:11.134
contracts are highly
confidential, but
I'll look into it.

18:11.201 --> 18:13.167
You calling Jack?
Yeah.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.434
This is Bauer.
Jack, Assad just gave us

18:18.500 --> 18:20.334
the name of a Russian general

18:20.401 --> 18:22.633
Fayed contacted a year ago
about the nukes.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.134
The general's name is Gredenko.

18:24.201 --> 18:25.867
Do you know him?
No.

18:25.934 --> 18:28.201
It turns out your father does.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.500
My father?

18:30.567 --> 18:33.034
Are you sure?
Yeah, Gredenko did business

18:33.101 --> 18:35.700
with BXJ Technologies,
specifically with your father.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.767
What kind of business?
We don't know.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.667
That's why we want
to talk to him.

18:39.734 --> 18:42.067
Bill, I don't understand--
is my father a suspect?

18:42.134 --> 18:44.633
No. His name came up
on a list of people

18:44.700 --> 18:46.201
who have had contact
with Gredenko.

18:46.267 --> 18:47.900
We're gonna question him.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.734
I wanted to check
with you first to see

18:49.800 --> 18:52.967
if you could shed any light.
I haven't spoken to him
for over nine years.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.533
All right, well, we'll send
someone over to talk to him.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.001
Bill, wait.

18:59.067 --> 19:01.167
I should do this.

19:01.234 --> 19:02.700
Jack, we can run this.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.234
You don't have enough time.

19:04.301 --> 19:06.368
He'll talk to me
if I go alone.

19:07.834 --> 19:10.834
Are you sure?
Yeah.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.500
All right, tell Stokes

19:12.567 --> 19:14.533
we'll pick him up--
you take the car.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.067
Let me know what you find out.
Thanks, Bill.

19:19.834 --> 19:23.234
You need to pull over.

19:23.301 --> 19:26.567
(indistinct talking)

19:26.633 --> 19:29.934
Yes, he is, but I
don't know exac...

19:30.001 --> 19:32.434
The FBI's here.
I got to go.

19:32.533 --> 19:35.134
Why did they send you?

19:35.201 --> 19:38.067
Believe me, Miss Palmer,
I didn't want to arrest
you or your friend.

19:38.134 --> 19:39.734
This is Agent Jennings.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.101
He'll be working this with me.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.800
Well, what exactly
will you be doing?

19:44.867 --> 19:47.800
Walid overheard some
conversations about the bombs.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.034
<i>He heard a fragment
of a conversation.</i>

19:50.101 --> 19:52.667
If there is an active cell
inside that detention facility,

19:52.734 --> 19:54.567
we need Walid to find out more.

19:54.633 --> 19:57.301
Agent Jennings will be
putting a wire on him.

19:57.368 --> 19:59.034
Putting a wire on him?

19:59.101 --> 20:00.734
I thought you were
gonna be replacing him

20:00.800 --> 20:02.134
with an undercover operative.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.301
Walid isn't trained
to do something like this.

20:04.368 --> 20:06.567
Well, he's already in place.

20:06.633 --> 20:09.067
He's established a confidence.

20:10.734 --> 20:13.734
How will you be putting
a wire on him?
Just...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.934
let us do our job.
(sighs)

20:19.334 --> 20:21.533
(men speaking Arabic
in distance)

20:33.867 --> 20:35.834
Have you heard anything more?

20:37.633 --> 20:38.867
About what?

20:38.934 --> 20:41.034
About what's going on
out there.

20:41.101 --> 20:43.034
Well, how would I know that?

20:43.101 --> 20:45.633
I thought...

20:47.500 --> 20:50.301
I was just wondering
if you... knew anything.

20:50.368 --> 20:52.734
No more than you, my brother.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.368
(speaking Arabic)

20:56.800 --> 20:58.633
I'm sorry,
I have to get back.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.001
Sure.

21:03.934 --> 21:05.900
JENNINGS:
Walid Al-Rezani.

21:05.967 --> 21:07.667
Yes?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.334
You and I have to talk.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.567
About what?

21:10.633 --> 21:12.633
You don't ask the questions,
you son of a bitch.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.767
I do.

21:27.368 --> 21:28.301
Get out.

21:28.368 --> 21:29.368
Get out!

21:32.034 --> 21:34.067
We know who you're
involved with.

21:34.134 --> 21:36.234
I told your people,
I work for the IAA.

21:36.301 --> 21:37.567
I'm not involved
in any kind

21:37.633 --> 21:38.867
of terrorist activities.

21:38.934 --> 21:40.700
You're lying!
I'm no terrorist.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.834
You're lying!

21:41.900 --> 21:43.734
(thump, groan)
What's he doing to him?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.001
What do you know?!
Don't worry.
He's not going to hurt him.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.001
It's just for show.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.301
(groaning)

21:48.368 --> 21:50.234
That doesn't sound like
it's just for show.

21:50.301 --> 21:51.500
Miss Palmer,

21:51.567 --> 21:53.567
I advised you to leave.
If you want to stay,

21:53.633 --> 21:56.767
keep your comments
to yourself.
JENNINGS: You hear me?!

21:56.834 --> 21:58.500
You're gonna explain to us
what we found in your wallet.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.900
What are you talking about?

21:59.967 --> 22:02.700
You know damn well what
we're talking about!

22:04.567 --> 22:06.034
(thump, groan)

22:06.101 --> 22:08.600
(under his breath): He's wiring
you. It's a two-way radio.

22:08.667 --> 22:09.900
Now, you're gonna tell me

22:09.967 --> 22:12.034
what we found in your
wallet. You understand me?

22:12.101 --> 22:14.401
What do you know
about this guy?

22:14.468 --> 22:16.101
(Walid groans)
Huh?

22:17.633 --> 22:19.034
This is ridiculous.

22:19.101 --> 22:20.468
What do you know
about this guy?
Sit down.

22:20.533 --> 22:21.800
JENNINGS:
Tell me now,

22:21.867 --> 22:23.900
or I'll take you
to the interrogation room.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.600
You don't want that.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.234
I'm not telling you anything.
I don't care

22:27.301 --> 22:28.633
what you do to me.
You will.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.434
You're gonna say that I
asked about this man.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.067
You gotta make them believe
you're working for them.

22:34.134 --> 22:35.267
(thump, groan)

22:35.334 --> 22:36.800
I'll be back for you.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.533
What did they do to you?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.867
Nothing.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.034
I'm fine.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.434
They think they can
do anything to us,

22:56.500 --> 22:58.368
those bastards.

22:58.434 --> 22:59.800
We've got a clear signal.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.267
(phone ringing)

23:10.867 --> 23:11.834
Hello.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.767
Sam, is that you?

23:13.834 --> 23:16.101
Yes. Who's this?

23:16.167 --> 23:18.734
It's Jack.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
Jack.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.767
How are you, Sam?

23:22.834 --> 23:24.734
We thought you were...

23:24.800 --> 23:26.167
Where are you calling from?

23:26.234 --> 23:27.434
I'm in Los Angeles.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.334
Listen, Sam, I need
to speak to my father.

23:29.401 --> 23:31.301
It's really important.
Is he there?

23:31.368 --> 23:32.567
No, he's not.

23:32.633 --> 23:33.667
Where is he?

23:33.734 --> 23:34.867
He left yesterday
without telling me

23:34.934 --> 23:35.967
where he was going.

23:36.034 --> 23:37.167
I haven't heard
from him since.

23:37.234 --> 23:38.600
Can I reach him
on his cell?

23:38.667 --> 23:39.867
He left it here.

23:39.934 --> 23:42.001
I must admit, it's
all a bit mysterious.

23:42.067 --> 23:43.334
I tried calling your brother.

23:43.401 --> 23:44.468
He didn't know either.

23:46.867 --> 23:48.101
Where is Gray?

23:48.167 --> 23:50.500
Well, he was at work earlier,
but who knows now?

23:50.567 --> 23:52.101
Can I get his cell number?

23:52.167 --> 23:55.167
Yeah. 818...

23:55.234 --> 23:57.633
555-0175.

24:00.101 --> 24:01.034
Okay, I got it.

24:01.101 --> 24:02.468
Sam, listen to me.
If you speak

24:02.533 --> 24:04.468
to my father, tell him
to get back to me

24:04.533 --> 24:06.434
at this number. Did it
show up on your screen?

24:06.500 --> 24:08.034
Yes.
It's really important.

24:09.633 --> 24:11.401
I hope you find
your father soon.

24:11.468 --> 24:13.301
I know he would want
to talk with you.

24:13.368 --> 24:17.001
He... regrets the way things
ended between the two of you.

24:19.434 --> 24:20.700
JACK:
Yeah, me, too.

24:20.767 --> 24:21.867
SAM:
Be well, Jack.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.834
JACK:
Thanks, Sam.

24:32.101 --> 24:33.067
MAN:
Yeah.

24:33.134 --> 24:34.734
It's Liddy.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.201
You'll never guess
who just called here.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.234
Who?

24:37.301 --> 24:38.401
Your brother, Jack.

24:38.468 --> 24:40.067
What are you talking about?

24:40.134 --> 24:42.034
Jack's rotting away
in some Chinese prison.

24:42.101 --> 24:44.267
No, actually he's here in L.A.

24:44.334 --> 24:45.533
How the hell did that happen?

24:45.600 --> 24:46.567
I don't know.

24:47.734 --> 24:48.667
What does he want?

24:48.734 --> 24:50.001
He's looking for the old man.

24:50.067 --> 24:52.434
Yeah, why?
He didn't say.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.700
But if I were you, I'd
expect a call from Jack.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.301
Your name came up.

24:56.368 --> 24:58.900
Damn it, we should have killed
Jack when we had the chance

24:58.967 --> 25:00.533
instead of handing him over
to the Chinese.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.034
We tried.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.667
This isn't good.

25:03.734 --> 25:05.567
My brother has a way
of digging things up

25:05.633 --> 25:06.667
that need to stay buried.

25:23.401 --> 25:24.367
--Hello.

25:24.434 --> 25:25.634
It's me, Jack.

25:27.334 --> 25:28.300
Jack?

25:28.367 --> 25:29.801
Yeah.

25:29.868 --> 25:31.167
Sam said you called,

25:31.234 --> 25:32.834
but I didn't believe him.
Are you okay?

25:32.900 --> 25:34.734
Yeah, I'm fine.
Is everyone safe over there?

25:34.801 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're,
we're cool, Jack. Wow.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.834
It's blowing my mind
hearing from you like this.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.701
Listen, I want you to know that
when Dad and I found out that

25:42.768 --> 25:44.967
you were in China, we tried
everything to get you out.

25:45.033 --> 25:47.200
We called in a
lot of favors.
Thanks.

25:47.267 --> 25:49.134
<i>Yeah. How, how did
you get out?</i>

25:49.200 --> 25:50.900
Some sort of exchange.

25:50.967 --> 25:51.900
Yeah? For what?

25:51.967 --> 25:53.033
I'm not really sure.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.667
It must have been
one hell of an exchange.

25:55.734 --> 25:57.367
Listen, Gray, I'm working
with CTU right now.

25:57.434 --> 25:59.000
I'm trying to help
them out with something.

25:59.067 --> 26:01.067
Yeah, uh, Sam said
that you were, uh,

26:01.134 --> 26:02.334
you were trying to find Dad?

26:02.401 --> 26:03.634
Yeah. Where is he?

26:03.701 --> 26:05.401
I don't know.
He took off yesterday without

26:05.467 --> 26:06.734
saying where
he was going.

26:06.801 --> 26:07.834
I assume he went to visit
one of his girlfriends.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.801
He's got a few of
them, you know.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.100
One of them's
really kind of hot,

26:10.167 --> 26:11.200
if you can believe that.

26:11.267 --> 26:12.801
Why did he leave
without his cell phone?

26:12.868 --> 26:13.834
Um... I guess he just

26:13.900 --> 26:14.900
didn't want to be bothered.

26:14.967 --> 26:16.401
Gray, I need your help.

26:16.467 --> 26:17.834
I need to find him.
It's important.

26:17.900 --> 26:18.900
Yeah, whatever you need, Jack.

26:18.967 --> 26:20.267
Um... I'll make
a few phone calls.

26:20.334 --> 26:22.067
Can I get back to you
at this number?

26:22.134 --> 26:23.100
Yeah.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.434
Okay. You got it.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.701
Thanks.

26:31.467 --> 26:33.200
(phone ringing)

26:33.267 --> 26:34.701
CTU. O'Brian.

26:34.768 --> 26:37.434
Chloe, it's Jack. I need you
to help me find an address.

26:37.501 --> 26:38.933
Whose?
Graem Bauer.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.900
Your brother?

26:39.967 --> 26:40.967
Yeah.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.667
It should be
in my family file.

26:44.634 --> 26:47.900
I haven't seen him
in years. Is he still in Malibu?

26:47.967 --> 26:49.567
No, he's in Indian Falls.

26:49.634 --> 26:52.100
226 Pine Crest Road.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.434
Do you want his
cell phone number?

26:53.501 --> 26:54.967
No.

26:55.033 --> 26:57.634
I already have it.
I just talked to him.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.900
Well, why didn't you ask
him where he lives?

26:59.967 --> 27:02.134
I'll get back to you.

27:03.967 --> 27:06.200
ANNOUNCER:
California Highway Patrol
wants to make clear

27:06.267 --> 27:07.300
that it is essential

27:07.367 --> 27:09.267
their emergency personnel
be allowed

27:09.334 --> 27:11.100
to reach those
injured in Valencia.

27:11.167 --> 27:12.933
So keep the streets clear.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.768
Once again, a nuclear bomb
has gone off in Valencia.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.067
The President will
address the nation...

27:18.134 --> 27:19.067
Dad.
Josh.

27:19.134 --> 27:21.100
...in a half hour.

27:23.367 --> 27:24.667
You and your mom
doing okay?

27:24.734 --> 27:27.300
Yeah. I mean, on the news
they're talking about

27:27.367 --> 27:28.801
nuclear
fallout.
We'll be fine.

27:28.868 --> 27:31.067
Look, you know, we're
actually safer now. They've made

27:31.134 --> 27:33.467
their big show in L.A.
with this nuke. Whatever's gonna

27:33.534 --> 27:35.667
happen next, I'm sure
it's gonna be in another city.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.467
Okay?
Yeah.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.967
Josh, I need to talk
to your mom alone.

27:42.033 --> 27:43.067
For a minute.
All right.

27:51.634 --> 27:52.967
I just got

27:53.033 --> 27:54.768
off the phone with
my brother, Jack.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.234
Jack?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.834
How? I thought

27:57.900 --> 27:58.900
the Chinese
were holding him.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.033
He's back in Los Angeles.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.267
(scoffs)

28:01.334 --> 28:02.267
It's impossible.

28:02.334 --> 28:05.200
Apparently not.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.768
He's looking for Dad.

28:06.834 --> 28:08.367
Is he coming here?

28:08.434 --> 28:09.701
Why?

28:09.768 --> 28:12.534
Are you hoping
he will?
Don't go there, Gray.

28:12.601 --> 28:13.667
We're already there.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.167
I'm just looking
for a little honesty.

28:15.234 --> 28:16.834
You weren't
over Jack

28:16.900 --> 28:18.834
when we got married,
and you're still not.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.667
Okay, how's this
for a little honesty?

28:21.734 --> 28:24.434
Insecurity in a grown man
is not attractive.

28:33.601 --> 28:36.467
"The latest
terrorist incident"?

28:36.534 --> 28:38.768
This was a nuclear bomb.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.467
Can we call it what it is?

28:40.534 --> 28:42.200
We thought it would
give the President

28:42.267 --> 28:43.467
a little more flexibility.

28:43.534 --> 28:44.667
Once you mention
the word "nuclear,"

28:44.734 --> 28:45.933
they're not gonna hear
anything else.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.501
No, actually, Ellen,
they will hear the truth.

28:48.567 --> 28:51.067
Everybody in this country
knows what happened today.

28:51.134 --> 28:52.701
And now they're looking
for reassurances

28:52.768 --> 28:54.200
that no matter how ugly

28:54.267 --> 28:56.900
this thing is,
the President is in charge.

28:56.967 --> 28:59.834
Listen, we don't have
any tangible leads

28:59.900 --> 29:02.200
and confidence is low.

29:02.267 --> 29:04.434
Now, if I go out there
and I lie to the American

29:04.501 --> 29:07.000
public and tell them that
we're on top of this,

29:07.067 --> 29:09.033
and then some other bomb
goes off somewhere...

29:09.100 --> 29:11.868
they won't believe a single
word I say. That can't happen.

29:11.933 --> 29:14.768
I agree, sir, and that's why
I see an opportunity here.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.067
Opportunity?

29:16.134 --> 29:17.667
This bomb is
going to remove

29:17.734 --> 29:20.300
any remaining doubt that we
should be taking more aggressive

29:20.367 --> 29:22.467
measures, suspension
of certain freedoms.

29:22.534 --> 29:24.701
Internment,
deportation.

29:24.768 --> 29:26.933
Now is the time to start
hitting those topics.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.401
Tom, you are counseling

29:28.467 --> 29:30.701
that we embrace
the politics of fear.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.300
I am saying that we

29:32.367 --> 29:34.434
<i>embrace reality.
We are afraid,</i>

29:34.501 --> 29:37.801
but if fear consolidates
public support

29:37.868 --> 29:41.267
for measures that save our
nation from extinction,

29:41.334 --> 29:43.900
<i>then you bet,
I'm in support of fear.</i>

29:43.967 --> 29:47.434
Tom, the people cannot be any
more afraid than they are now.

29:47.501 --> 29:50.701
I would like this message
to have a calming effect.

29:50.768 --> 29:52.868
<i>Yes, we will call this
a nuclear bomb, because</i>

29:52.933 --> 29:54.768
<i>that is what it is,
but if we expect</i>

29:54.834 --> 29:56.634
civil order
on those streets,

29:56.701 --> 29:59.434
we cannot stoke the panic.

29:59.501 --> 30:02.567
We're not gonna mention
policy in this speech.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.834
The American public
just needs to know
that every single member

30:04.900 --> 30:06.834
of this administration
is working with the single

30:06.900 --> 30:10.100
purpose of restoring order and
making our streets safe again.

30:13.534 --> 30:15.300
I don't need a list of names.

30:15.367 --> 30:18.167
I need one person
who can do the job.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.467
MAN:
I'll get back to you.

30:20.801 --> 30:23.033
(horn honks)

30:29.334 --> 30:31.434
What took you so long?

30:31.501 --> 30:34.134
Why couldn't you just pick me up
at my place, huh?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.834
Instead of leaving me
on some street corner

30:35.900 --> 30:38.134
looking like some hooker.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.501
Just get in the car.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.768
Do not... talk to me...

30:47.834 --> 30:49.100
like one of
your bimbos.

30:49.167 --> 30:50.367
You got me?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.134
They just

30:54.200 --> 30:55.801
said on the news

30:55.868 --> 31:00.134
that if the wind changes...
we're screwed.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.501
I just want to get
out of the city

31:05.567 --> 31:06.501
and get to Vegas.

31:06.567 --> 31:07.834
We're not going to Vegas.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.967
Oh, no. I'm not
going to Palm Springs...

31:11.033 --> 31:12.900
Again. No. No, no.
That's where  you

31:12.967 --> 31:14.534
can just drop
me off right here.

31:14.601 --> 31:16.701
That place is like assisted
living for an entire city.

31:16.768 --> 31:18.300
We're not going
there either.

31:18.367 --> 31:19.367
We have some things

31:19.434 --> 31:20.701
we gotta do
here first.

31:20.768 --> 31:22.567
What are you talking about?

31:22.634 --> 31:26.868
A nuclear bomb just went off,
like 25 miles from here.

31:26.933 --> 31:28.900
I'm talking about
a lot of money.

31:28.967 --> 31:30.234
Now, shut up.
Darren.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.033
Stop talking...

31:32.100 --> 31:34.067
now!

31:37.334 --> 31:38.267
FAYED:
Yes.

31:38.334 --> 31:39.534
Things are looking up.

31:39.601 --> 31:40.933
What does that mean?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.033
It means

31:42.100 --> 31:43.701
I might be able to find someone

31:43.768 --> 31:44.868
to do your
dirty work.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.300
How soon?

31:46.367 --> 31:48.701
I expect to have some good
news for you within the hour.

31:48.768 --> 31:50.534
Just make sure my money
is ready to wire.

31:50.601 --> 31:51.967
The money is ready now.

31:54.067 --> 31:55.967
McCarthywillfind
someone for us.

31:56.033 --> 32:00.634
<i>Tell the men these bombs will
go off today as scheduled.</i>

32:19.267 --> 32:20.700
--Finished with Assad.
He gave me

32:20.767 --> 32:24.034
a few more names, but nothing
that he thought would help.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.367
BUCHANAN:
a What else did he say?

32:25.434 --> 32:27.367
He wants peace.

32:27.434 --> 32:28.967
You believe him?

32:30.634 --> 32:32.267
Yeah.

32:37.668 --> 32:40.100
The President would like you
transported to Washington DC.

32:40.167 --> 32:44.767
You'll be leaving out
of Port Hueneme
on a military jet.

32:44.833 --> 32:48.167
Some of the information
you gave us checked out.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.501
Good luck here in Los Angeles.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.134
I hope the worst
is over.

32:52.201 --> 32:53.501
Thank you.

33:12.967 --> 33:15.833
Sir, the FBI just upgraded
one of their leads.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.301
They're sending us live audio
they think we should monitor.
What kind of audio?

33:18.367 --> 33:21.467
They've got a guy wearing
a wire at the Anacostia
Detention Facility.

33:21.534 --> 33:24.767
They think one the detainees may
have information about Fayed.

33:24.833 --> 33:27.501
Give it to Chloe.
Make it a priority.

33:51.801 --> 33:54.634
--Walid should not
be doing this.

33:54.701 --> 33:55.901
He's going to be okay.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.634
That is not the point.
This was his decision.

33:57.701 --> 33:59.333
And it was the right one.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.467
Usually it takes weeks or months
to develop a cover.

34:01.534 --> 34:03.734
He might be able to find
something out within hours.

34:03.801 --> 34:06.168
If this works, he'll have done
a heroic thing for his country.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.199
Please don't give me
speeches, okay?

34:08.266 --> 34:10.034
If it works?
What if it doesn't?

34:10.101 --> 34:12.833
What if they find out
he's wearing a wire?
The guards inside

34:12.900 --> 34:15.001
know what's going on.
They'll keep
an eye on him.

34:15.068 --> 34:17.068
Right.
You know, it's
probably not

34:17.134 --> 34:18.367
the best thing that you're here.

34:18.434 --> 34:20.600
I've told you before--
Walid is my client.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.199
I know what you told me,

34:22.266 --> 34:24.101
and frankly that carries
no weight with the FBI.

34:24.168 --> 34:26.068
Now let's be honest.

34:26.134 --> 34:27.967
The only reason
you're here,

34:28.034 --> 34:29.233
is you're the President's
sister.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.233
Then you remember that,
and we'll be fine.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.934
You don't have any trouble
bending the rules

34:35.001 --> 34:36.600
when it's to your advantage,
do you?

34:36.667 --> 34:38.734
(Salim speaking Arabic)

34:41.233 --> 34:43.300
What did they
want with you?

34:45.034 --> 34:47.199
I shouldn't bring
you into this.

34:47.266 --> 34:48.801
It's all right.

34:48.867 --> 34:50.266
You can talk to me.

34:52.101 --> 34:54.534
I heard the guard say

34:54.600 --> 34:56.168
he found something
in your wallet.

34:56.233 --> 34:57.967
Yeah, they confiscated it.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.434
What was it?

34:59.500 --> 35:01.767
What did he find?

35:01.834 --> 35:02.867
A phone number.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.867
Whose?

35:12.834 --> 35:14.367
Listen to me.

35:14.434 --> 35:17.134
If you and I are in
the same situation here,

35:17.200 --> 35:19.068
we should know each other.

35:21.834 --> 35:24.567
Talk to me.

35:24.634 --> 35:28.101
Maybe I shouldn't have
gotten involved.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.333
I met some people through
my organization.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.734
What organization
is that?

35:31.801 --> 35:33.600
The IAA.

35:33.667 --> 35:34.801
I'm regional director.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.168
Go on.

35:37.233 --> 35:40.134
Most of what we do
has no teeth.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.300
I was introduced to a man
who was more active.

35:42.367 --> 35:43.400
I wanted to help him.

35:43.467 --> 35:45.333
That's good.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.667
We set up a meeting,

35:46.734 --> 35:48.667
but before I had a chance,
I was grabbed.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.600
Who is this person?

35:54.634 --> 35:55.834
Abu Fayed.

35:58.834 --> 36:00.200
You know him?

36:01.934 --> 36:03.667
No.

36:03.734 --> 36:06.101
But, please...

36:06.168 --> 36:08.001
Join us, brother.

36:20.033 --> 36:21.801
--He did that well.

36:21.868 --> 36:23.434
What happens now?

36:23.501 --> 36:25.467
He's going to have to sell
himself to the others

36:25.534 --> 36:26.667
before they open up.

36:30.567 --> 36:32.534
(doorbell rings)

36:38.534 --> 36:40.734
Jack...

36:40.801 --> 36:42.701
uh... didn't know that
you were coming here.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.100
We need to talk.

36:44.167 --> 36:46.467
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Come on in. Come in.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.801
Damn, Jack,

36:51.868 --> 36:55.601
it's good to see you.
Good to see you.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.934
Um, you've never been here
before, have you?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.234
No.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.868
God, when was the last
time we saw each other?

37:03.934 --> 37:05.133
When Teri died.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.400
That's right.
The funeral.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.834
Have you found Dad yet?

37:08.901 --> 37:11.601
No, no, I made some calls,
but so far noth...

37:11.667 --> 37:12.701
Hey, Josh.

37:12.767 --> 37:14.634
Come here.

37:14.701 --> 37:15.667
Josh, this is
your Uncle Jack.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.968
You two have not
seen each other

37:17.033 --> 37:18.968
in a long time.

37:21.334 --> 37:22.667
Hey.

37:22.734 --> 37:24.868
Hi, Josh.

37:27.133 --> 37:28.634
How you doing?

37:28.701 --> 37:29.934
Okay, I guess.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.634
It's kind of been a weird day.

37:31.701 --> 37:33.734
Yeah, I know.

37:33.801 --> 37:37.234
Josh, give your father
some privacy.

37:44.234 --> 37:45.801
JOSH:
Maybe we can
talk later.

37:45.868 --> 37:47.200
I would like that.

37:51.567 --> 37:53.834
Marilyn, I'm sorry
for the intrusion.

37:53.901 --> 37:55.367
I just need to get

37:55.434 --> 37:57.534
some information
about our father
and then I'll leave.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.868
Well, that was pleasant,
wasn't it?

38:05.934 --> 38:08.167
Come on, let's go
to my office.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.234
Have a seat.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.968
I'm fine.

38:26.033 --> 38:28.367
Okay, so what are we doing
here, Jack?

38:28.434 --> 38:30.300
Our father used
to do business

38:30.367 --> 38:31.934
with an ex-Russian general.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.901
His name was Gredenko.
Do you know him?

38:33.968 --> 38:35.567
Um... no.

38:35.634 --> 38:37.834
He must be one of
the old guard.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.801
You can't believe some of the
drinking buddies

38:39.868 --> 38:41.000
Dad's cultivated over the years.

38:41.067 --> 38:43.334
Oh, there was
this one time,

38:43.400 --> 38:44.734
we were down in Venezuela,
this was before Chavez...

38:44.801 --> 38:46.000
Gray!

38:46.067 --> 38:48.801
I didn't come here
to listen to your stories.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.000
I'm serious.
I need to find Dad.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.901
Okay, we will.

38:53.968 --> 38:55.400
Boy, Jack, you
could never just

38:55.467 --> 38:57.100
walk in a room
and get along, could you?

38:57.167 --> 38:58.767
I mean, I know, you know,

38:58.834 --> 39:01.300
you must have gone through
hell in China and everything,

39:01.367 --> 39:03.367
but look on the bright side--
you got out.

39:03.434 --> 39:05.334
You're here. You should just
relax a little bit.

39:33.467 --> 39:34.467
--Ow.

39:38.934 --> 39:40.268
Ow!

39:47.234 --> 39:48.967
If you try and raise
your voice, I will rip

39:49.034 --> 39:50.600
your tongue out,
are we clear?

39:53.201 --> 39:55.268
Gray, people in this
country are dying.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.600
I need some information.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.433
Are you going to
give it to me,

39:58.500 --> 40:00.534
or do I have to start
hurting you?

40:00.600 --> 40:01.767
Actually, you're
hurting me now.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.600
Trust me... I'm not.

40:12.268 --> 40:13.934
(door opening)

40:14.001 --> 40:17.234
The speech is in
the teleprompter, sir.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.967
With the most
recent changes?

40:19.034 --> 40:20.134
Yes, sir.

40:20.201 --> 40:23.168
Okay.

40:25.168 --> 40:27.534
Are you all right, sir?

40:31.467 --> 40:34.667
Tom, I can't let the American
public see how scared I am.

40:34.734 --> 40:37.001
No, you cannot.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.234
But then we just got hit
by a nuclear bomb.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.534
Bravado would be no more
appropriate than fear.

40:44.967 --> 40:46.567
Thank you, Tom.

41:18.901 --> 41:21.034
My fellow Americans,

41:21.101 --> 41:24.567
there is no easy way
to say the words...

41:24.634 --> 41:26.801
America has been hit
by a nuclear weapon.

41:26.867 --> 41:30.934
But, as you know, this is
now a fact.

41:31.001 --> 41:34.168
The question remains,
what do we as a country,

41:34.234 --> 41:36.667
as a people, do about it?

41:36.734 --> 41:39.101
How do we rationalize
the fear and sorrow

41:39.168 --> 41:40.534
that each one of us feels?

41:40.600 --> 41:44.234
Do we let our anger guide us
down a dangerous path?

41:44.300 --> 41:46.700
Or do we come together,

41:46.767 --> 41:49.500
continuing to show courage
and strength

41:49.567 --> 41:51.801
in the face of our enemy?

41:51.867 --> 41:53.867
Now, this horrible act of evil

41:53.934 --> 41:55.801
which has struck
our great nation

41:55.867 --> 41:58.268
is the cowardly action
of barbaric men.

41:58.333 --> 42:00.333
One more thing comes
out of your mouth
that I don't want

42:00.400 --> 42:02.767
to hear, and this is
gonna start to hurt.
I told you, I don't know

42:02.834 --> 42:04.134
where Dad is.
What do you want from me?

42:04.201 --> 42:05.467
The truth.
That is the truth.

42:05.534 --> 42:07.567
I swear to you on
my family's life.

42:10.901 --> 42:13.500
Not good enough.

42:19.067 --> 42:20.634
(clattering)

42:22.500 --> 42:24.168
You brought this on yourself.
