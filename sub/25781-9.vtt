01:12.989 --> 01:14.783
Dad, please respond.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.826
Voltron is coming. Hold on.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.411
Are we too late?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.794
Katie? Katie, is that you?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.338
Dad, it's me. I'm here.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.549
Katie, I'm so glad to hear your voice.
Where are you?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.219
We're within the Solar System.
Heading to Earth now.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.221
Wait! You must stop!

01:36.638 --> 01:39.140
- What? Say again.
- Stop.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
Sendak has invaded the planet.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.644
He's taken over Earth.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.063
If he finds out that Voltron is here,

01:45.146 --> 01:48.149
he'll threaten the people of Earth
in exchange for the Lions.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.236
Reverse thrusters!

01:51.528 --> 01:52.987
Copy that. Hold tight!

02:00.870 --> 02:02.789
Pick up those Galra ships' locations.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.208
We need to scramble
any transmissions immediately.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.960
Scanning location.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.961
I got it.
They're opening a channel.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.297
Triangulating position for broadcast.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.632
Sending interference.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.972
Paladins, we blocked
the patrol's transmission.

02:19.055 --> 02:19.889
You're clear.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.225
Roger that.
Let's take 'em out!

02:30.942 --> 02:33.486
Wait! Don't destroy that ship.
We might need it.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.573
-Really? For what?
- I've got an idea.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.743
We can't fly our Lions to Earth
without being spotted,

02:40.910 --> 02:43.746
so they'll have to stay here
on this moon in Saturn's rings,

02:43.830 --> 02:46.416
which should keep them hidden
from Sendak's radars.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.126
We'll fly in another way.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.933
I hope the mice and Kaltenecker
aren't too frightened without us.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.257
Hang on!
We're entering Earth's atmosphere.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.009
This is weird.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.679
This is almost exactly how we left Earth,
crammed in the cockpit of the Blue Lion.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.432
We're overweight.
I'm losing altitude.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.892
Brace for impact!

04:13.836 --> 04:16.005
Hey, I know this place.
I've been here.

04:16.505 --> 04:17.507
This is Plaht City.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.801
It's about a half an hour
from the garrison.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.222
Whoa, I can't believe
this is all that's left of it.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.391
We need to get to the garrison.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.350
Stay together.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.768
Let's move quick and quiet.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.084
Whoa! Take cover!

05:05.179 --> 05:07.557
I'll distract it, you take the shot.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.517
Don't miss.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.122
I wonder how many of these things
they have around here.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.417
Pidge, any chance we could see
those things before they get to us?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.503
Already on it.
Looks like four more headed our way.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.134
It's not drones. Look.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.359
Huh?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.749
Stay down, we got this!

06:18.377 --> 06:19.212
I had it.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.422
Drones send distress signals
when attacked.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.174
Our weapons neutralize those signals.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.551
So unless you wanna deal
with a swarm of those things,

06:25.635 --> 06:26.719
let us handle it.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.055
Now let's get out of here
before more show up.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.487
Mom!

07:28.322 --> 07:29.157
Oh!

07:30.199 --> 07:32.535
Oh, Katie, I'm so glad you're home!

07:34.412 --> 07:35.371
Lance!

07:36.164 --> 07:37.415
Uncle Lance!

07:38.499 --> 07:39.750
Oh. Hey!

07:44.964 --> 07:46.007
My son.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.971
- It's so good to see you.
- We never gave up on you.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.389
I missed you so much.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.059
Oh, my gosh.
You two are so much bigger now.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.853
You're the same size.

08:00.980 --> 08:01.856
Hey, Hunk.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.691
We're going to miss you so much

08:03.774 --> 08:05.735
now that you're going to be
a space explorer.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.029
Well, I don't know about space explorer.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.615
I was thinking more of a mechanic
for space explorers.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.618
Can you build us a spaceship?

08:13.910 --> 08:16.829
Uh, well, I don't need to
because we're already in one.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.794
It's good to have you home.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.924
So, my family?

08:30.384 --> 08:31.719
We'll get them back soon.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.979
Officer Shirogane.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.607
It's great to see you again.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.151
My apologies for throwing you
in quarantine.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.071
Ah, so you're the one
who strapped Shiro to a table.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.447
I heard about that.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.451
You were just following orders,
as any good soldier would.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.745
It's great to see you, too.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.623
Allow me to introduce you
to our Altean allies.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.252
Meet Allura, Romelle, and Coran.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.379
The honor is mine.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.716
Your technology has been instrumental
in defending this small corner of Earth.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.719
Oh, yes.
Pop-Pop was quite the genius.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.429
And, Cadet...

09:16.889 --> 09:17.807
Yes, sir.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.935
I owe you an apology as well.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.187
I've heard about all you've done.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.439
I was wrong about you.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.359
It's an honor and privilege
to see you again.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.694
Thank you, sir.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.531
I guess I wasn't exactly
the best cadet back then.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.033
I probably owe you
a bit of an apology, too.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.457
Ah, and who's this little fella?

09:45.501 --> 09:47.211
Oh, Kosmo likes you.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.588
But be careful.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.257
If you touch it, it could zap you
to a different universe.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.174
Hmm?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.384
Seriously.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.734
Adam...

10:11.652 --> 10:12.695
I'm sorry.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.033
It's because of them
that Earth still has a chance.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.244
It's time for our debriefing.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.712
Sendak's forces remain at bay,
but without a meaningful supply line,

10:29.795 --> 10:31.547
we're slowly being suffocated.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.383
No one else is putting up a fight
against Sendak?

10:34.550 --> 10:37.511
Small underground pockets of resistance
have attempted to do so

10:37.595 --> 10:39.347
with varying degrees of success.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.225
Eventually, all were discovered
and systematically wiped out.

10:43.517 --> 10:47.355
Earth's offensive capabilities simply
don't stand a chance against the Galra.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.107
Why don't we bring more people
into this base?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.443
We've had to put a halt
on our extraction ops

10:52.526 --> 10:54.403
as they were proving to be too risky.

10:54.528 --> 10:57.114
But there are good people out there.
They could be protected.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.282
My family's out there.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.035
I'm sorry, Hunk.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.245
But if we have an opportunity now--

11:03.329 --> 11:05.831
Hey, do Paladins not understand
the chain of command?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.625
Your CO said it was too dangerous.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.543
Officer Griffin, that's enough.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.215
Believe me, I understand
what you're going through, Hunk.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.676
We all have family out there,
but we have to weigh our options.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.805
We can't lose ten people to save 12.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.390
I'm sorry.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.811
Well, then let's find out what we can do.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.814
You said you've integrated Altean tech
with Earth weaponry?

11:43.285 --> 11:47.123
The Mecha-Flex-Exo fighters,
or MFEs, are extremely agile

11:47.206 --> 11:48.707
with advanced weaponry,

11:48.791 --> 11:50.960
but are only capable
of short-range attacks.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.296
Sustaining power
with Altean-infused technology

11:54.380 --> 11:56.048
is an issue we're trying to overcome.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.759
Maybe I can help you out with that.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.761
I do have some leftover Faunatonium.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.932
It's an Altean fuel additive,
but also has some unexpected side effects,

12:05.015 --> 12:06.559
so don't get any on you.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.195
And this is our battleship.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.364
It's large enough to house
all of the Lions

12:20.448 --> 12:22.074
and an entire command unit.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.162
It's built, but it can't fly.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.499
Everyone, there's a subject
we can't avoid any longer.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.003
Sendak attacked Earth
because he wanted the Lions,

12:34.086 --> 12:35.171
and now they're here.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.174
It seems that we need to at least
discuss our options.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.553
Are you suggesting that we willingly
hand over the Lions to the Galra?

12:43.095 --> 12:44.430
Our supplies are gone.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.391
We spent all our resources
on a ship that doesn't fly.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.227
The weapons we do have
are not enough to mount an attack.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.522
All we can do
is protect a small pocket of Earth.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.024
But for how much longer?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.818
The universe needs the Lions.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.863
So does Earth.
They're our only bargaining chip.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.406
I agree with the admiral.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.534
Earth has been nearly destroyed.
Countless citizens have been lost.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.786
But it could all be over
if we give up the Lions.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.998
We have a fighting chance
now that the Lions have returned.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.374
We need to take it.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.627
I'll settle this argument right now.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.463
We're not giving up the Lions
under any circumstances.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.965
There is no negotiating with Sendak.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.053
Maybe you should leave the matters
of Earth to the people who live here.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.305
Please, Admiral.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.600
I respect that you'll do anything you can
to protect Earth.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.893
But trust us,

13:31.519 --> 13:33.938
we've been through more
than you could ever imagine.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.858
We have fought the Galra on the fringes
of the universe and in their very home.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.903
I know there's a way to defeat Sendak.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.781
How? We barely know
what we're up against.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.492
We need intelligence,
and we just don't have it.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.868
Maybe we do.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.788
That information you downloaded
from the Castle of Lions

13:50.871 --> 13:52.164
contains Sendak's memories.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.707
How does that help?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.086
It might give us some insight
into Sendak's plan.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.129
Allura, you're a genius!

14:00.464 --> 14:01.966
We just need some time.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.811
Everything from the castle
is stored here.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.189
Processing the massive amount
of complex Altean data

14:17.273 --> 14:19.024
takes nearly every node we have.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.734
Sifting through that much information

14:20.818 --> 14:23.070
is like trying to find a needle
in a haystack.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.948
Then let's get started.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.289
I'm actually quite impressed,

14:33.372 --> 14:37.251
despite the obviously crude nature
of Earth's technological capabilities.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.253
It has a lot of potential,

14:39.378 --> 14:42.047
but I'm unable to recreate
the power of a Balmeran crystal.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.301
Maybe your Faunatonium
will work for this as well?

14:45.759 --> 14:46.802
Afraid not.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.723
A ship like this might need two or three
battleship-class Balmeran crystals.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.183
I don't suppose
there are any Balmera nearby?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.352
In this young galaxy?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.980
Oh, yeah,
it's right next to the Wizblattle.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.233
That's a no.
No Balmeras around here.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.324
Those are Officer Holt's designs
for some of the injured soldiers.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.659
They're extremely advanced,
but like everything else,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.370
we don't have an adequate power source
to make them viable.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.623
Here they are--
Sendak's memories.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.959
It's just code
until we find a way to interpret it.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.503
I might know a way.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.801
-Found it.
-Good job, Hunk.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.428
Now, you remember what to do.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.143
Is everything okay in here?

15:36.393 --> 15:37.227
Yeah.

15:37.978 --> 15:38.812
Look...

15:39.897 --> 15:42.232
I'm not really good
at talking with people, and I...

15:42.316 --> 15:44.401
I don't expect you
to open up to me, but...

15:44.985 --> 15:47.905
-If there's ever anything on your mind--
-This situation stinks!

15:47.988 --> 15:50.324
I can't believe
we finally get back to Earth

15:50.407 --> 15:51.825
and it's taken over by Galra.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.912
I guess there is something on your mind.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.747
I know it's stupid,

15:56.830 --> 16:00.000
but I used to daydream about coming home
to a peaceful Earth.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.877
And that would've been great.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.712
But I realized that nothing...

16:04.588 --> 16:07.299
Nothing would have been greater
than seeing my family.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.093
But I can't.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.554
And all I keep thinking about
is that I wasn't there for them.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.807
And I don't even know if they're okay.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.310
And I see Pidge and Lance
with their families, and--

16:18.394 --> 16:20.521
I mean, I'm happy for them. I am.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.983
But it just...
It makes me miss my family more.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.776
I-- I just...

16:27.069 --> 16:28.904
I've never felt so alone and scared.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.657
Look, Hunk...

16:33.242 --> 16:37.663
I never told you this,
but of all the Paladins,

16:38.414 --> 16:40.207
you're the one I'm most impressed by.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.586
It's no secret that you've been
the most scared, but...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.547
you've never backed down.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.549
Never.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.344
And to be brave
is to go on in spite of fear.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.887
And that's who you are, Hunk.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.141
I know you're scared, but your family...

16:57.975 --> 17:00.019
they need you to be strong right now.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.606
Okay.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.067
All right. Now we're huggin'.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.111
Thank you, Keith.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.113
Whu--

17:12.114 --> 17:13.531
Where are you going?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.992
I'm going to get my family.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.619
Not without me.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.506
Huh?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.383
You two heading somewhere?

17:32.634 --> 17:34.261
This doesn't concern either of you.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.389
No, but you'll probably be concerned
with the patrol drones

17:37.473 --> 17:39.266
that will spot you within seconds.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.143
And you might be concerned with the blast

17:41.226 --> 17:44.521
from Sendak's automated low-orbit,
long-range blaster satellite

17:44.605 --> 17:45.564
that takes you out.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.857
What's your problem?

17:46.940 --> 17:50.569
My problem is I don't wanna see
our only hope for saving Earth get hurt.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.529
That's why we're coming with you.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.459
Uploading.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.877
And... there.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.632
Whoa.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.050
Amazing!

18:13.425 --> 18:15.344
We're mimicking the way
the Castle of Lions

18:15.427 --> 18:17.471
interacted with King Alfor's memories.

18:17.971 --> 18:18.847
Test it out.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.432
Ask him a question.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.269
Um, all right.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.063
What is your name?

18:26.688 --> 18:30.609
I am Commander Sendak,
a royal officer to the Galra Empire.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
Where are you from?

18:32.861 --> 18:36.573
I am proud to say I was born
with unquestionable Galra lineage.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.370
Commander, explain to me
your methods for conquering planets.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.081
There are as many ways
to conquer a planet

18:44.164 --> 18:45.833
as there are planets themselves.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.043
Primitive species are the easiest.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.963
It usually doesn't take more than
one or two waves of attack

18:51.046 --> 18:52.548
to bring them to their knees.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.259
What about more advanced civilizations?

18:55.926 --> 18:58.637
There are always those willing
to sacrifice themselves

18:58.720 --> 18:59.930
for the greater good.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.600
That's why it is best to find something
they value more than themselves

19:03.684 --> 19:05.060
and make that the target.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.603
What do you mean?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.856
Citizens of advanced civilizations

19:08.939 --> 19:10.899
have the weakness
of caring for each other.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.403
A military operation of that scale
takes immense time and resources.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.281
Our operations
rely on the resources of the planet.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.575
They become our supplies
and feed our occupation.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.702
Have you ever failed
in overtaking a planet?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.746
Tenacity and time conquer all foes.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.167
What if a planet refuses to give up,
no matter the cost?

19:28.917 --> 19:32.713
If a planet refuses to give up,
then we annihilate it.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.549
But only one planet has ever refused.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.301
Altea.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.599
I'm sorry, I think I need a break.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.120
She did it.
The signal's sent.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.040
-Okay, now what?
-Now we wait.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.801
Okay, just about done.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.641
Oh, I hate waiting.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.851
But waiting's the best part.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.937
It's the time we get to spend together.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.664
Come with me, quickly.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.801
Amazing.
The rumors are true.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.471
Word of the Paladins' return
has inspired the resistance.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.306
Thank you for your help.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.268
Tell the resistance
we're gonna get rid of the Galra.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.603
Words we've waited a long time to hear.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.147
Is this where they've taken
all the prisoners?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.572
What are they doing down there?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.908
They have work camps
operating day and night

21:24.992 --> 21:26.493
mining ore for Sendak.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.161
It's been nonstop for months.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.123
He's building something,
but no one is sure what.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.084
I thought the labor force
was outside the encampment.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.128
They were,
but they've been moved in.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.254
What does that mean?

21:38.005 --> 21:40.716
It means we can't get you to your parents.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.467
No.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.219
No. Please.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.806
Believe me, if there was a way,
we would do it.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.559
Can I at least see them from here?

21:55.522 --> 21:58.358
You wanted to see me?
I thought you were with Pidge and Sam.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.736
Sendak's memories were hard to hear.

22:01.611 --> 22:04.406
But it did remind me
of something my father once said.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.577
He told me that there are those
with the power to destroy,

22:08.660 --> 22:10.454
and those with the power to create.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.380
I see movement.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.841
It looks like the workers are exiting.

22:30.974 --> 22:31.933
That's them.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.686
My mom, my dad.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.439
Don't worry.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.192
You just need to hang on a little longer.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.818
We're gonna get you out.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.822
I'm going to get you out.
