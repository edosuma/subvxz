00:28.987 --> 00:31.206
There is nothing
to compare it with.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.578
It's the most exhilarating place
in the world.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.336
It's like being able to fly.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.426
Just like growing wings.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.598
If it's in your blood, you...
You can't get it out.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.473
You just want more.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.190
You put
the earplugs in, the helmet goes on.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.408
Everything goes quiet.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.197
You know what's ahead of you,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.158
and everything else around you
is forgotten

01:06.159 --> 01:08.161
and it's time you get on with the job.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.620
My mind goes completely blank.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.282
And my mind just goes into madness.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.837
Well, I suppose
it all revolved around

02:50.545 --> 02:52.422
Mr Acum,
me primary school teacher; really.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.804
And he didn't half put manners in us,
that man.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.594
You know, in my day, like, and all that.

02:56.595 --> 02:58.721
But I think, you know,
fuck it, what a boy.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.978
Just, you know, if we was naughty,
he used to give us the slipper:

03:02.140 --> 03:04.313
We knew we was getting it,
cos he used to warm it up on a radiator

03:04.314 --> 03:05.310
before he give us it.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.809
If we was naughty again, which was
mostly me, I was naughty all the time,

03:08.814 --> 03:11.112
we used to have to pick stones up
so the lawn mower

03:11.233 --> 03:12.450
wouldn't run over them.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.230
He used to have his own putting green
out the back of school

03:15.237 --> 03:20.164
and our main job was keeping the
putting green right and mowing grass.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.619
And then, yeah,
I thought natural progression,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.330
I wanted to go and race them.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.756
I've still got my first engine
I ever had.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.172
Suffolk Punch lawn mower engine,
I think it's down there.

03:29.173 --> 03:31.169
Yeah, I just used to play with that.
It was all I wanted to do.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.469
I wasn't bothered about...
You know, I had a few mates.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.263
But I wasn't bothered about,
you know, girls.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.928
I'm still
not bothered about girls, really.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.308
I'm not gay or owt.

03:41.722 --> 03:46.319
But I'm just, you know, I'd rather play
with lorries and tractors and engines.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.729
Still, I haven't really grown up.
No, I haven't grown up.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.240
- You got the key?
- Yeah.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.324
Are we all right, then?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.199
Right hand down, boss.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.169
Road racers? A bit mad...

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
That's tight. You bastard.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.433
What would you say...

04:19.634 --> 04:21.226
A tile short of a roof?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.188
One short of a six pack?

04:24.014 --> 04:26.688
A few slates adrift?
We'd use that one a lot.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.309
Lights are on but no one's home.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.017
I can imagine,
from the outside looking in,

04:30.020 --> 04:32.994
anyone that's racing the TT looks like
the lights are on but no one's home.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.645
You're not a proper road racer
until you've won a TT

04:47.829 --> 04:50.037
I obviously aren't a proper road racer,
because I haven't won one.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.008
But I'm trying. I don't give in.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.264
Barry Sheene wasn't a big fan, was he?

04:58.850 --> 05:00.087
He thought it was too dangerous,
did he?

05:00.091 --> 05:02.674
There you go, lager-shandy drinking
southern poofters, there you go.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.554
That says it all, doesn't it? Yeah.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.730
That's it, we're away now.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.906
All right, boss.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.612
We're getting there.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.148
I was only watching that
the other night, the Dam Busters.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.780
Yeah, it's mega, that. Wallis Barnes.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.951
You know the idea
that got him into that was, um...

05:26.076 --> 05:28.078
No. Not Napoleon...

05:28.703 --> 05:31.677
Who was your boy, that used it in
the battleships? Beginning with an "N"?

05:31.873 --> 05:33.250
Not Napoleon...

05:37.337 --> 05:40.011
Different things
make different people happy, don't they?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.083
Some lads love going to the pub,
I don't like being in the pub.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.755
Some lads love shagging,
I don't like shagging

05:43.760 --> 05:45.387
I don't mind it, but I'm not into it.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.605
I'd rather just go and ride
me motorbikes or me pushbikes.

05:47.607 --> 05:49.389
It's whatever you're into, isn't it?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.644
If we was all the same everybody
would be at the TT wouldn't they?

05:51.645 --> 05:54.487
But different things
make different people tick.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.766
And that makes me tick, and that's
why I'm gonna keep on going.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.399
I just want to keep going
until I've won one.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.439
Or won five, that's my plan, win five in
a week, that's not been done before.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.072
So I go and do that, then that's it.
I go find the next job to do.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.901
I've got another big goal, this...

06:05.907 --> 06:09.036
He's a massive... Well, not massive,
he's not massive, is he?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.621
He's not massive.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.456
People use that word, don't they.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.417
I'll tell you what people word...
People use all the time.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.294
Unbelievable.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.124
Can't use that word, can you?
"Unbelievable."

06:20.130 --> 06:21.623
When a man...
Like I've said this before,

06:21.631 --> 06:24.294
when a man eats his own head, I will
then hold my hands up and say,

06:24.301 --> 06:26.474
"Right, that was unbelievable."

06:26.636 --> 06:28.479
Cos I can't believe
a man can eat his own head.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.682
But, like we say, never say never.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.358
Unbelievable,
absolutely unbelievable.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.488
Evel Knievel was
the big stuntman at the time

06:40.489 --> 06:44.204
and I had a stars and stripes suit,
and a stars and stripes helmet

06:44.205 --> 06:45.951
and I thought I was Evel Knievel,
you know.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.683
My dad used to build me a ramp
and I used to jump 14 toy buses,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.336
where Evel Knievel tried
to jump the 14 real buses.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.044
I wrote to Jim'll Fix it,
for me to do a jump with him

06:55.206 --> 06:57.674
and he never even replied back,
the miserable old goat.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.416
It's always been in me.
I don't know any different.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.171
I'm not really interested
in anything else, you know,

07:01.172 --> 07:02.388
football, cricket or anything.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.802
It's just been bikes
all the way through my life.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.159
He's still a little boy
at heart. He's crackers, really.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.648
When I met him,
he'd just finished motocross

07:28.657 --> 07:30.159
and he was wanting
to get into racing bikes.

07:31.159 --> 07:35.164
And he always said, "I'm going to do
an Isle of Man TT race one day."

07:35.497 --> 07:38.751
And he said, "I just want to win a TT
I'll get it under my belt and that's it.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.752
"I'll, you know, never do it again."

07:41.211 --> 07:42.633
And he won his first 250 race,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.098
and we're like, "Oh, that's it,
he's going to finish now."

07:45.099 --> 07:46.296
I thought, "Thank God for that."

07:46.299 --> 07:49.052
But it just makes that bug
grow even bigger; I think.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.972
Even then,
when I was 10 years old,

07:51.973 --> 07:53.635
I just used to watch it,
and it'd just blow me away.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.893
I used to think,
"That's gonna be me one day.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.402
"I'm gonna win one of these."

07:57.519 --> 07:59.442
If I had been sat there then,
and someone would have said,

07:59.447 --> 08:02.691
you know, I'll have 15 wins, I probably
would have laughed at them

08:02.857 --> 08:05.656
and fell off the wall,
but here I am with 15 wins.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.071
But I still get that,
you know jitters now.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.749
You know, TT's coming. TT's coming.
Building up. Building up.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.083
I get apprehensive, nervous.
Months before the TT you know.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.998
And when I think about it, it makes
me skip a heartbeat, really.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.460
I have to have the house immaculate,
and the garage has to be immaculate.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.993
Everything's got to have its place.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.456
I'll mow the lawn, make sure
that's all right. Clean the cars.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.759
So, just in case anything does happen,
then everything's ready.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.929
I definitely think about it.
It's got to cross your mind.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.895
It has to cross your mind,
cos it's there, all the time.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.061
It's a reality that
you might not come back.

08:41.270 --> 08:45.651
John McGuinness 17.43, 127,

08:45.734 --> 08:48.237
under the lap
record from a standing start!

08:49.279 --> 08:51.077
For two
incredible weeks each summer;

08:51.239 --> 08:53.833
generations of men and women
have made the pilgrimage

08:53.950 --> 08:56.999
to the lsle of Man to pit
themselves against the track,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.498
which has achieved international status

08:59.914 --> 09:02.167
and become synonymous
with speed and glory

09:04.335 --> 09:07.305
At a time when the maximum
permitted speed on English roads

09:07.505 --> 09:11.135
was just 20 miles per hour
and racing strictly prohibited,

09:11.593 --> 09:14.642
a band of enthusiasts
intent on testing their bikes

09:14.721 --> 09:17.315
and themselves to the limits
of speed and endurance

09:17.474 --> 09:19.101
gathered on the Isle of Man,

09:19.267 --> 09:21.986
and in 1907 the Tourist Trophy was born.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.074
You see? Look at the suspension.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.955
You see?

09:35.617 --> 09:37.995
And then we'll put it the other way.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.581
Watch that.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.009
Keep watching.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.853
It'll do something.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.641
See? Look at that. Hey?

09:54.094 --> 09:57.519
Me and Guy have got
the typical father-son relationship.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.484
- Guy knows best, and I knows best.
- Yeah.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.024
I'll put a brew on.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.779
See, a Steadicam That's what it is.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.001
Must have shockers in it or something.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.111
You what?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.741
Say, when you was
holding that thing you can jar

10:12.747 --> 10:14.999
but that takes all the jar
out of the camera, doesn't it?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.810
Are they dear?
I bet it's dear that, innit.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.722
Go on, how much is that arm there then?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.919
Fourteen hundred?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.667
Fuck off.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.339
Fourteen grand?

10:29.254 --> 10:30.631
Fourteen grand.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.641
Fucking hell.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.562
Fuck, have you seen that?
Fourteen grand.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.821
Me first TT was '74,

10:47.355 --> 10:50.950
riding a Gus Kuhn Norton
Commando production bike.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.078
I thought,
I'm gonna be a TT superstar here.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.494
So I set off from...

10:57.323 --> 10:58.666
How old was you?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.744
I was...

11:03.204 --> 11:04.456
How old was I?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.458
1974.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.919
Forty seven. What's that, then?

11:09.085 --> 11:14.467
- I don't know. '74... '47. By heck.
- Anyway...

11:14.757 --> 11:17.180
Come into Glen Helen,
up Craig Willie's hill,

11:17.385 --> 11:18.432
cranked it in...

11:18.761 --> 11:20.638
Down, down, down,
no further to go, bang.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
Straight over the bank.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.058
The bike finished up in three bits.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.102
And I broke my back.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.109
And I was back at the TT again
the following year.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.113
My worst crash ever?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.532
Probably North West, 2008.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.193
Come off the Black Hill, lost the front,
on the apex of the corner;

11:41.201 --> 11:42.794
not very fast, maybe 120 miles an hour

11:42.952 --> 11:45.000
Hit the kerb with my arse
at 120 mile an hour

11:45.205 --> 11:46.832
I walked away. Walked away no bother.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.415
The bike was nothing,
we could hardly salvage anything.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.339
Everything was written off on it.
Everything.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.300
I got away from that, but it scarred me.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.056
It didn't scar me for life, it just....

11:55.465 --> 11:58.309
Proper. I just thought another one
of those moments I thought, ooh.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.811
But that's a buzz that,

12:00.812 --> 12:02.759
you know get it wrong, you're
an inch out here and that's it.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.956
Yeah, it was a lot like that.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.020
I'm not like
a sadomasochist or anything,

12:10.021 --> 12:12.144
I'm not purposefully going out there
trying to kill myself

12:12.148 --> 12:14.892
No, definitely not. The opposite,
really, I want to succeed, you know?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.728
But that's the buzz you get
out of trying to do that.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.828
You do end up in that position

12:17.830 --> 12:20.363
where it looks like it's going
to be game over at any moment.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.744
But, those positions, money cannot
buy the buzz you get out of it.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.264
That thing that you get, that you
think, "That's it, game over,"

12:27.330 --> 12:30.209
you don't go into a panic, you just,
"This is it, game over."

12:30.210 --> 12:31.835
I've been in about four of them
since I've been racing,

12:31.836 --> 12:33.256
and I've been racing 10 years now.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.262
And all of those moments, I think three
of those moments were at the TT.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.152
I come to the gym
a couple of times a week,

12:49.352 --> 12:52.572
and get out on my mountain bike
a couple of times a week.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.326
I enjoy my training
and it keeps me focused on the job.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.573
I don't like anything to
sort of let my riding slip.

13:01.698 --> 13:05.328
If a bit of training's what it takes,
then that's what I do.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.372
I've always been a bike fanatic

13:09.539 --> 13:12.008
but my parents have
always been against it

13:12.417 --> 13:16.467
and by the time I got to 15, I think
I wore my parents down that much.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.636
They were a bit concerned
about me getting a road bike

13:19.716 --> 13:25.018
so they got me a trials bike
and the minute I was 17, I took my test

13:25.179 --> 13:28.353
and got a road bike,
so it backfired a bit on my parents.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.888
But, you know, I met a group of lads
that blagged a caravan for free,

13:31.894 --> 13:33.237
it was an absolute wreck.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.240
Dragged it all over the country,
it was falling apart

13:36.566 --> 13:40.912
and we got to race meetings, had a few
beers at a barbecue, raced all day.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.537
It was just great
to experience that side of it.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.537
Natural ability pulls you
through to a certain level,

13:48.745 --> 13:52.215
but if I'm in a race and it
comes down to a tight battle,

13:52.915 --> 13:55.839
and I lose the race basically
through fitness or something,

13:56.002 --> 13:57.754
you know, I'd be devastated with myself

13:57.754 --> 14:01.008
so I get very obsessed
about what I'm doing.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.927
There's only one outcome for me.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.392
To win the race.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.318
Every one of the 37 and
three-quarter miles of public roads

14:12.393 --> 14:15.488
that makes up the course has
created a champion or hero.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.033
Over 200 corners must be
negotiated up to six times

14:19.108 --> 14:22.408
to complete the world's toughest
road race in the fastest time.

14:23.613 --> 14:27.834
There are five races over a week
culminating with the Senior TT

14:28.284 --> 14:30.286
With speeds of up to 200 miles per hour

14:30.453 --> 14:33.127
and the opportunity
for disaster around every corner;

14:33.373 --> 14:35.125
its dangers are set in stone.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.051
To date, 231 riders have lost
their lives on the TT course.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.598
To win just one TT
is an outstanding achievement.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.852
The legendary Joey Dunlop
has an unmatched 26 wins,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.817
John McGuinness holds
the outright lap record

14:53.017 --> 14:56.863
and Phil McCallan is the only rider
to have won four out of the five races

14:57.021 --> 14:58.489
run each year

14:59.482 --> 15:02.326
No one has ever won five out of five.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.209
So, can I ask Fred Dibnah___
Sorry, I meant Guy Martin.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.841
- So the laundry didn't come back?
- No...

15:22.171 --> 15:23.838
I get told off
for not saying the right thing,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.888
or doing this, or doing that
and not wearing the right clothes

15:25.889 --> 15:27.015
and what have you.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.175
And it just sort of gets
on top of you sometimes.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.827
Well, not gets on top of you,
but it takes the fun out of it all.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.068
Whereas Wilson, for me, he's doing it
for the same reasons I'm doing it.

15:35.069 --> 15:37.057
You know, doing it to enjoy it.
Doing it to win.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.238
I see it as David and Goliath.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.782
And that I think that's
what motivates me in many ways.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.532
That Guy come back
to a small team and can win.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.247
Could you call it
a deal, Wilson?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.324
There weren't a lot of
paper signing going on.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.302
Just a firm handshake I think, Wilson.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.327
I suppose I should say
to have a gentleman's agreement,

15:55.329 --> 15:57.297
we need two gentlemen.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.425
Well, I wouldn't say I was a gentleman.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.219
Guy's all right.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.547
Yeah, but we won't go
as far as gentleman.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.237
You know when I was wanking, didn't you?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.923
Oh, yeah, I used to regularly wake up
and see Guy pulling one out.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.428
I had to go back
to bed for a few minutes

16:11.429 --> 16:12.806
while he finished himself off.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.326
Yeah, cos he used
to sleep above the cab.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.605
I slept above you, didn't I?

16:16.606 --> 16:18.483
You could tell.
I didn't really know that

16:18.603 --> 16:20.805
until I broke my ankle right bad,
you remember that?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.064
Your toes go, do you know?

16:22.231 --> 16:23.904
When you're wanking. Yeah.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.400
So you'd see Guy's toes twitching...

16:25.401 --> 16:26.493
And you knew I was on it.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.510
In the morning, his toes'd be going,
and I'd give him five more minutes.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.656
- Crack a load off.
- Yeah. Get a load off.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.620
In the build-up to the TT

16:35.620 --> 16:38.419
every other race meeting is
a chance to perfect the bikes,

16:38.420 --> 16:39.916
impress new sponsors

16:39.999 --> 16:43.173
and develop the speeds needed
to compete on the Isle of Man.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.466
You having a brew?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.639
We're not here
for any lap times or fuck all, really.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.922
We're not bothered
whether We're last or first.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.435
We're just here to suss the bike out.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.230
You need to be a good
mechanic to work with me,

16:54.290 --> 16:55.760
and I'm a bit awkward
to get on with, I suppose,

16:55.765 --> 16:58.092
because I'm very particular
about how I want stuff doing.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.429
Most motorbike riders just get on it
and turn the throttle,

17:00.436 --> 17:02.234
but I like to know
what makes that bike tick.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.148
I like the whole idea behind
the old internal combustion engine,

17:05.316 --> 17:06.943
and the way stuffs made.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.616
You need to have a bit
of mechanical sympathy, don't you.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.954
You can't go charging in there
like a bull in a china shop.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.573
It's all gonna end in tears, isn't it?
You end up breaking gear boxes

17:13.574 --> 17:16.042
and blowing engines up
and all that sort of caper.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.778
Still no quick shifting, we don't
know anyone that's got one.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.048
No.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.545
Mechanical failures
are what all riders dread.

17:27.797 --> 17:31.176
Sometimes they're over-revved,
and sometimes something breaks.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.181
om My God.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.360
You know, if a part breaks,
then it's just bad for everybody

17:40.643 --> 17:43.817
in the TT particularly, because,
well, you only get one hit

17:44.146 --> 17:46.444
and then you got to wait 12 months
to have another go.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.073
I don't have heroes
until Chris Mayhew.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.320
Yeah, he's the boy. Mad, in a way.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.498
Lovely bloke, into his dogs.
He nearly got his dog to talk.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.247
Nearly. Likes his grandfather clocks.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.664
Makes his own wine, he's got a grapevine
growing out of his garden.

18:00.665 --> 18:03.166
Through a window, that he's chiselled
out in his conservatory,

18:03.332 --> 18:05.255
that grows into his conservatory.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.633
You know, gets his own grapes.
Makes his own wine.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.047
That's a boy that, innit.
Not many folk do that.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.597
I got an entry
to the TT in '73.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.013
And I crashed in both races.

18:17.346 --> 18:21.442
So, I saw more of Noble's Hospital
than the track really.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.192
What I do, basically,
is take a road engine

18:26.272 --> 18:27.865
and turn it into a race engine.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.911
My biggest boast, I think,
was in the hundredth year of the TT

18:32.528 --> 18:34.576
Every single winning engine
or lap record machine

18:34.655 --> 18:35.702
came out of this workshop.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.585
You know Guy I think, has got
the best bikes he ever could.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.371
I shall obviously do my best

18:41.579 --> 18:44.048
and Guy obviously will put
the finishing touches to it.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.709
If he's happy, he'll be there.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.387
I have every confidence
that if things work in our favour

18:50.713 --> 18:52.511
we're going to come away with a result.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.895
One thing I'm concerned about is
we mustn't start thinking it's our turn.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.354
Cos it never is your turn.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.274
But I think the ingredients are right

19:02.725 --> 19:04.602
if they're mixed properly.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.405
Northern Ireland's
North West 200 race meeting

19:15.406 --> 19:17.156
also takes place on public roads

19:17.323 --> 19:20.577
and is the very last chance to get
the bikes ready for the TT.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.251
Heads down
for the lights above the track

19:28.459 --> 19:30.678
and when they go out
this race will be underway.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.968
And Michael Dunlop's
been mugged, hasn't he!

19:32.969 --> 19:34.306
Onboard
with Michael Dunlop, then,

19:34.310 --> 19:36.087
just looking what was
going on in front of him.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.985
There you see him,
coming down over the hill.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.474
165 miles an hour!

19:39.595 --> 19:41.097
That's a man's corner; that!

19:43.933 --> 19:46.732
Michael Dunlop and his brother
William are the next generation

19:46.936 --> 19:49.940
of a road racing dynasty
that began with their Uncle Joey

19:50.106 --> 19:51.949
and father Robert Dunlop.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.327
They were
the biggest road racers I think,

19:55.403 --> 19:56.575
that the world has ever had.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.457
So the inspiration I got
from them was just so much.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.543
Growing up with two people,
you never seen them as heroes

20:02.702 --> 20:05.376
or superstars, you just
see them as two normal people.

20:12.294 --> 20:16.015
Joey blew out the competition
when in 2000, aged 49

20:16.340 --> 20:18.468
he won a third hat trick of TT races.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.441
He was killed three weeks later
in a little-known race in Estonia.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.352
Over 50, 000 mourners
attended his funeral.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.242
His brother Robert
was almost killed in 1998

20:35.317 --> 20:36.569
when his rear wheel collapsed

20:36.652 --> 20:38.654
in an accident at the TT

20:40.156 --> 20:43.035
but raced for 10 more years
until his death in 2008

20:43.200 --> 20:46.204
during the final practise lap
at the North West 200.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.173
He knew the circuit,
he knew it well,

20:50.174 --> 20:51.668
and a mechanical failure happened

20:51.834 --> 20:54.337
and it happens to the best of riders.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.097
It was a sad loss to the sport,
a sad loss to us, you know.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.386
But for some reason, I just thought
that Saturday I wanted to ride the 250.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.851
Tears of joy
and look at Michael Dunlop.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.478
Two days after
witnessing his father's death,

21:07.641 --> 21:11.566
Michael went on to win the race
and reduce the onlookers to tears.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.823
What must be
going through his mind right now

21:14.023 --> 21:16.492
because that was more than a race.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.532
You're only a young man,
you know,

21:18.533 --> 21:20.484
all you have for life is a bit of craic,
you know what I mean?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.582
And you don't think you're gonna
have to bring on a lot of stuff

21:22.583 --> 21:25.577
so I got turned from a boy into a man
in a very short space of time.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.378
And I hope they're up there now,
and they're being looked after.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.054
Conor Cummins!

21:37.296 --> 21:39.390
Conor Cummins,
the Isle of Man rider;

21:39.391 --> 21:40.768
he's fast, really very fast.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.060
And he's down! Cummins is down!

21:43.219 --> 21:46.063
I took the lead from Ryan, just as I
was coming out of the come;

21:46.555 --> 21:48.808
the back end sort of stepped out on me

21:48.974 --> 21:50.817
and high-sided me
over the top of the bike.

21:51.185 --> 21:54.735
And I was really, really lucky
to come away unhurt there.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.446
I just had to pick myself up,
dusted myself down,

21:59.401 --> 22:01.244
and straight out on the bike
in the next race.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.801
If you fall off a horse,
you get straight back on it.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.079
Guy has taken a tumble, too.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.913
I'm all right, I mean,
bloody hell, it's not bad, is it?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.339
That's been, damn, l've just done...
I done that.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.417
And me finger, can you see me finger?

22:15.459 --> 22:17.577
Didn't keep me eye on the ball,
you know, so much going on.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.179
And, yeah, my fault.

22:19.180 --> 22:21.580
Hit the kerb on the inside and took
the front, ended up in the grass.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.469
Bike was OK, we had to put a new...
What did we have to do?

22:24.760 --> 22:25.932
What did we have to do?

22:27.513 --> 22:29.766
Engine cover. Water hose.

22:29.767 --> 22:30.766
I didn't wreck it.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.186
Michael Dunlop,
that's Ryan Farquhar number 77...

22:33.269 --> 22:36.113
Someone's blown up. That's Guy Martin.
Guy Martin, the engine has gone.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.782
In the second race,
Guy over-revs the bike

22:38.858 --> 22:40.280
and blows up his engine.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.861
He's completely
out of the race.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.455
This was
not a good meeting here,

22:45.457 --> 22:47.165
as far as results are concerned.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.027
We had a couple of things
that didn't go according to plan.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.256
Aye, "a couple"? A bit more
than a couple, but yeah.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.842
It has been a learning curve.

22:56.850 --> 22:58.540
You may think
we're a bit old to be learning,

22:58.544 --> 22:59.761
but we're still learning.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.757
The upside, Guy will go
to the TT with that bike

23:02.965 --> 23:05.263
and two brand new engines, brand new.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.939
Speed's not bad, need to work
on speed a little bit, but it's not bad.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.257
Stability's good, handling's good,
tyres are good,

23:12.266 --> 23:14.439
there's a few issues,
but we're happy now.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.862
I'm going, and my ferry's
booked. I'm going in the camper

23:20.983 --> 23:22.530
because otherwise you're sat at home.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.488
You know you're sat at home,
twiddling your thumbs.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.706
You know, waiting for a phone call.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.034
So you might as well
be there, among it all.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.670
- You lock the door?
- Yeah.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.697
For over 100 years,
the Isle of Man

24:07.780 --> 24:09.327
has attracted riders and race fans

24:09.448 --> 24:12.543
to watch their heroes
race the mountain course.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.834
The modest prize money means
that this close knit band of brothers

24:15.996 --> 24:18.419
ride purely for the love of the sport

24:18.582 --> 24:20.050
and the glory of winning.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.087
If you're born on the Isle of Man

24:23.087 --> 24:26.136
you're sort of brought up
with motorbikes and races.

24:27.007 --> 24:29.556
You've got the island
going from black and white,

24:29.677 --> 24:31.896
quiet, rural country roads.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.229
All of a sudden they've got teams
of bikers going down them.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.570
it’s just lovely to see
the island come alive.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.614
Stories, nothing but stories.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.277
Spinning away
to the height of their glory.

24:49.284 --> 24:52.083
It's a festival.
it's a coming together of everyone

24:52.282 --> 24:53.704
who appreciates motorcycling

24:53.867 --> 24:56.290
The stories that are told,
as you sit at the hedge,

24:56.453 --> 24:58.706
or the marshals
in groups around the island,

24:58.872 --> 25:01.625
are all lived and relived every year.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.702
And we never get tired of swapping them.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.363
Let's just say there's a large
segment of the motorcycling population

25:10.426 --> 25:13.270
in America that knows
well about the TT, as I do,

25:13.595 --> 25:16.189
and probably have put it on their,
what we call a bucket list,

25:16.432 --> 25:18.259
things to do before you kick the bucket.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.521
To go to the TT and that's why I'm here.
I had the opportunity to come.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.979
It's something I've always wanted to do.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.948
My father and I talked
about coming here together

25:24.949 --> 25:26.496
for years and never did.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.032
He's passed away, so it's on me to come

25:29.111 --> 25:30.454
and enjoy the experience

25:30.456 --> 25:32.790
and share it with him
however I can later on perhaps.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.538
Well, I've worn these leathers
for 27 years now,

25:35.701 --> 25:41.458
and at least 27 years more
I will bring the leathers to the TT.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.801
My name is Karen Anderson,
and I've come all the way from Australia

25:45.085 --> 25:47.133
to watch Cameron Donald race the TT.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.095
We've sat above here,
in a room on the balcony,

25:54.100 --> 25:56.098
and we've watched the guys
coming around that corner,

25:56.138 --> 25:57.481
and there was a lamppost there.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.893
And the lamppost was padded, and
they would come round, dipping,

26:01.060 --> 26:04.781
and then they'd do that in and out,
to get round the lamppost

26:04.938 --> 26:07.361
And that to me was heart
in my mouth, heart in my mouth,

26:07.362 --> 26:08.739
heart in my mouth, brilliant.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.869
Yeah, I know what can happen.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.374
But with her on the back,
you won't get too quick,

26:15.375 --> 26:17.377
else you get beat up.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.250
It's a very hairy place. Very fast.

26:20.788 --> 26:23.041
To watch the bravest men in the world.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.512
And if it doesn't excite you,
you're not alive.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.635
And that's a fact.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.605
Within hours of arriving,
Guy is unhappy

26:42.684 --> 26:44.061
with the bike's suspension.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.733
In particular the swinging arm

26:45.896 --> 26:48.570
because of its importance
for a fast wheel change.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.197
Wilson. Can we put
the other swinging arm in

26:51.401 --> 26:52.802
and get Simon to change the wheel?

26:52.861 --> 26:53.862
It's shit.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.205
And it's gonna go wrong.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.523
If the bike was given to me
in the first place, Wilson,

26:57.533 --> 26:59.113
then we wouldn't be
going through this problem.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.541
And I did say this in the first place.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.001
Guy has upset
the authorities, too,

27:07.167 --> 27:10.171
because of his plans to work
on the bikes away from the paddock.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.672
I was expecting
there to be tension,

27:12.756 --> 27:14.429
because that's why I stayed out the way.

27:14.430 --> 27:15.930
I've got the airbed that goes
in the back of my van,

27:15.931 --> 27:17.527
and I've just been staying in my van.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.810
When it comes to how
I want bikes preparing,

27:20.811 --> 27:23.011
if they aren't right, that's it,
I'll just pack in and go home.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.224
I won't stick my neck out if things
aren't exactly how I want,

27:25.227 --> 27:26.604
and I'm so meticulous with things.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.276
We're gonna meet in the middle,
we're gonna have to meet

27:28.277 --> 27:30.060
in the middle, aren't we?
I can't have it all my way, can I?

27:30.065 --> 27:31.357
Because Wilson's bought the bikes,

27:31.358 --> 27:32.875
and put a lot of money into the bikes.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.235
But I'm the one
risking me neck out there,

27:34.236 --> 27:35.453
and that's why my head
needs to be right.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.027
And Wilson's always said to me
from the off

27:37.030 --> 27:39.238
that my head needs to be right,
and then to get my head right

27:39.241 --> 27:42.962
it needs to be my way, which is doing
bikes with no interruptions.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.413
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to meet
in the middle, me and Wilson.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.039
The bikes will have to be
back here at a certain time,

27:47.040 --> 27:49.134
and then I have to do certain bits

27:49.209 --> 27:51.211
of nodding and smiling
and agreeing with people.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.965
There's a contract.
The team gets X number of pounds,

27:55.132 --> 27:57.760
so they expect Guy to be professional.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.230
And Guy sometimes makes statements
that they don't like.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.393
People like him. Maybe because
there's a bit of a rebel about him

28:06.518 --> 28:10.398
and so on. So, we have to... We just
have to make do with what we have.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.030
If I dictated to Guy it wouldn't work.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.786
He's just a mechanic,

28:15.787 --> 28:18.451
who is a brilliant rider,
a brilliant motorcyclist

28:18.906 --> 28:20.203
The bikes are ready to race,

28:20.365 --> 28:23.039
but he has to have
his touch to the bikes.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.289
He knows I have given him
everything he has asked for.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.800
So, it has to work this time.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.262
And the bike will be checked
and checked again for anything.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.181
And then you're in the lap of the gods.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.145
What's after the corner
makes a massive difference.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.490
If you get this corner right
and make a proper job of it,

28:53.649 --> 28:56.072
then you can make 10 seconds up,
because you don't brake

28:56.276 --> 28:58.950
or let go of the throttle
for the next three miles.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.327
But it's a man's come;
get it wrong and you're....

29:02.282 --> 29:03.374
Ballascary.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.127
Ballagarey. Did you see the sign there?

29:06.286 --> 29:08.009
But, yeah, get it wrong
and it's gonna hurt.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.122
But you don't think
about things like that, do you?

29:10.123 --> 29:11.786
If you wanna fast lap out, you've got to

29:11.792 --> 29:13.794
throw your balls to the wall,
as it's said.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.523
After a bright start today,
it will turn cloudy later this morning,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.688
then, although staying mostly dry
this afternoon,

29:28.689 --> 29:30.986
there could be
patchy light drizzle possible...

29:52.374 --> 29:54.752
All right, boss? Good man.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.057
I think Guy Martin's
real rivals this year

30:02.092 --> 30:03.184
will be manyfold.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.725
Cameron Donald has always been a threat.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.811
He's a bit highly-strung.
But he's fast. Really fast.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.192
Conor Cummins
is gonna be a big threat.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.480
Conor Cummins,
Local Manxman. He's fit. He's young.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.111
Ryan Farquhar
has gone ahead of Joey Dunlop

30:17.190 --> 30:20.160
in national wins in Ireland
and he's phenomenal.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.886
The Dunlops
are coming strong,

30:21.945 --> 30:25.165
Michael's really aggressive,
and got that will to win-

30:25.324 --> 30:27.696
Definitely wouldn't want to
get in a ring with him, anyway.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.295
Keith Amor again, he's like
a dog on a lead, you know?

30:30.370 --> 30:33.465
He's just chomping at that bit
to go fast and win.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.617
You never know
what Bruce you're gonna get.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.373
If Bruce wakes up in the morning
and decides he wants to beat us all,

30:38.378 --> 30:39.779
he'll probably go beat us all.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.390
You never
bet against John McGuinness

30:41.423 --> 30:42.504
he's the man at the minute.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.350
He's the man
with the results on the board.

30:44.351 --> 30:46.761
He's the man that when you go quickly,
he usually raises the bar

30:46.762 --> 30:48.139
and goes a bit quicker again.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.974
Nobody knows
how fast John can go.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.276
Nobody has actually
taken John to that next level.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.818
You never
underestimate anyone.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.604
Someone could come out from the woodwork

30:55.771 --> 30:58.115
that you just didn't really expect
and shock you.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.143
I don't know much
about Hutchinson, to be truthful.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.778
He's one of the quiet men in the sport.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.621
Just does the job, I think.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.533
He reminds me a bit
of myself you know, 10 years ago.

31:07.616 --> 31:08.833
He's absorbing everything,

31:08.992 --> 31:11.120
understanding what it takes
to win at a big race now.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.598
Guy, you know I think every man
and his dog in the world

31:13.622 --> 31:15.340
wants flipping Guy Martin to win.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.834
There's no question he's gonna win one,
he's definitely got the talent,

31:17.839 --> 31:19.827
but there's some ingredient missing
at the moment,

31:19.836 --> 31:22.385
and it just seems to find him.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.463
It's gonna be the best man
that's gonna win on the day.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.968
At the end of the day.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.182
And nobody wants to win it
more than I do.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.683
As speeds increase,
so do the dangers

31:32.849 --> 31:37.275
and it was this that lost the TT
its world championship status.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.490
But winning at the TT
requires more than just speed.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.658
It relies on mechanical perfection,

31:42.818 --> 31:44.820
supreme mental and physical endurance,

31:45.028 --> 31:49.033
a huge dose of good fortune
and a very fast pit stop.

31:50.117 --> 31:53.087
A tank of fuel and a set of tyres
will only last two

31:53.245 --> 31:55.418
of the four or six laps required.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.333
Pit stops count
toward the overall lap time

31:58.500 --> 32:01.845
and can make or break a rider's chances.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.009
- Thirty-three.
- Bloody hell! Well done, lad.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.478
But if we have one mistake,
it goes to 40.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.388
The swinging arm
that's in the bike now isn't safe

32:14.474 --> 32:15.726
to do a fast pit stop.

32:15.727 --> 32:18.058
It just happens the bike I had
last year was sold to a bloke

32:18.061 --> 32:20.860
on the Isle of Man, and I've begged
and pleaded with him

32:20.861 --> 32:23.058
to see if we can borrow
the swinging arm back out of his bike,

32:23.066 --> 32:25.068
to put back in my new bike
for this year

32:25.277 --> 32:27.371
So he said,
"Pop up and nick it this afternoon."

32:27.612 --> 32:30.707
And then we'll go up tomorrow morning
and put it back in the bike.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.460
I could do with your help.

32:37.622 --> 32:41.217
Guy's father has decided
not to come to the race this year

32:41.877 --> 32:44.721
It's a bit of a hard pill
to take, really, me dad not coming.

32:44.722 --> 32:46.394
You know, he's a good man
to have involved

32:46.395 --> 32:47.888
because he's got
so much experience round here,

32:47.893 --> 32:50.887
he's rode the TT for 15 years and
he knows exactly how things need to be.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.296
That'd give me confidence,
if he was involved.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.728
And now he's not here.
it's not fucked the job,

32:55.932 --> 32:57.559
but it's made it a lot harder

32:58.435 --> 33:01.439
And it took my eye off the ball
a little bit, but what do I do?

33:01.855 --> 33:03.653
Can't sit and cry about it, can you?

33:08.403 --> 33:11.407
Martin Finnegan, really good friend
of mine in racing, in racing.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.083
I was at his wedding.

33:13.325 --> 33:18.627
In, I think it would have
been at November time of 2007.

33:19.247 --> 33:22.751
Yeah, in 2007.
And then his funeral was in

33:24.586 --> 33:26.588
April time of 2008.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.756
You know...

33:28.131 --> 33:31.135
Teammate of mine,
Darran Lindsay, was killed in 2005.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.752
Friend of mine, used to do his engines,

33:34.804 --> 33:37.978
Richard Britten, he was killed 2006.
You could go on.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.524
I just think, you know...

33:43.271 --> 33:44.523
When you're time's up...

33:46.608 --> 33:48.827
I think you've got to be
in this line of work, you know?

33:48.985 --> 33:51.238
And that's why
I sort of don't believe in

33:51.404 --> 33:53.156
having any commitments of any sort.

33:53.406 --> 33:57.912
Because if I did have responsibilities
as wife, kids, mortgage

33:57.913 --> 34:00.036
and all that sort of caper,
I couldn't do this job,

34:00.038 --> 34:02.132
as in racing the TT,
I couldn't give it me all.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.942
And I wanna give it me all.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.294
Yeah. Before I can start
thinking about winning races,

34:07.295 --> 34:08.712
we've got a lot of practice
to get through.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.466
You know, we've five nights
of practice to get through.

34:11.467 --> 34:14.090
That's not going to be easy. There's
a lot of work to do on the bikes.

34:14.091 --> 34:15.592
And that's where me dad
was gonna come in.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.481
It's not just gonna go straight on the
bike, a lot of things will need making,

34:18.483 --> 34:20.261
to get that swinging
arm to suit the new bike.

34:20.266 --> 34:24.022
But, if it was easy, every man and his
dog would be at it, wouldn't they?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.099
I I'll chill out later on.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.233
I find a different place
every night to kip in me van.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.239
Just get me airbed blown up
in the back of me van.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.244
Bit of a wank, then go to sleep.
You know? Proper!

34:39.536 --> 34:43.166
Proper. You know, people get all...
It's not a crime, is it, to have a wank,

34:43.167 --> 34:44.165
you know. Fuck it.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.892
You never get complacent
with the TT

35:02.893 --> 35:04.518
There's always something you can learn,

35:04.519 --> 35:07.442
and, you know, if you get that way
and overconfident, it'll bite you.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.847
I just went up and had
a little moment on my own,

35:12.907 --> 35:15.200
looking down the road
because the road was shut.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.246
There wasn't a sound apart from
the birds just tweeting away.

35:18.247 --> 35:21.370
And that's just something real special
about the track itself you know,

35:21.661 --> 35:25.040
I was just looking down
thinking next week, in the race,

35:25.206 --> 35:27.880
I'm gonna be going down there
at 200 mile an hour plus.

35:29.586 --> 35:32.260
That emotion you feel
when you roll up onto that start line,

35:32.380 --> 35:35.133
when you're getting waved off
10 seconds apart, it's just...

35:36.092 --> 35:37.264
It's just unbelievable.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.183
It's like nothing else
I've ever experienced.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.474
It's not about
beating the next guy.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.059
It's about who beats the track.

35:44.225 --> 35:50.073
This TT is the most powerful
race you'll ever do in your life.

35:50.774 --> 35:53.618
I love it, and it's legal.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.742
People often ask,
"Why do you road race?"

35:56.905 --> 36:00.910
Because circuit racing is fast, you
can get a buzz, but it's not the same.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.244
Circuit racing
is rock climbing with a rope.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.413
It's dangerous.
But there is some room for error

36:05.622 --> 36:07.419
You slip, you fall, you've got a rope.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.209
Road racing is like free climbing.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.703
You know you're climbing up that same
mountain, you're on a course,

36:11.711 --> 36:13.509
but there's no room for error

36:13.755 --> 36:16.759
If you make a mistake it's,
it's going to be, you know...

36:17.384 --> 36:19.637
Well, it could be
serious injury or worse.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.432
You're doing maybe 170,
180 mile an hour;

36:23.433 --> 36:26.230
going through fast bends
with trees, hedges, brick walls.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.727
It's the greatest thing.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.983
And you realise

36:29.989 --> 36:31.766
the dangers before you put
your leg over the bike.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.775
I mean, at the top
of Bray Hill before I go out,

36:34.109 --> 36:36.783
you know, you have lots
of strange thoughts in your mind

36:36.945 --> 36:40.119
and you're nervous and you're worried,
but as soon as you set off;

36:40.281 --> 36:42.124
and you get the tap off
the start marshal

36:42.127 --> 36:44.211
to go down Bray Hill, that's gone.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.589
Then once you're actually
out here the noise, the wind,

36:47.997 --> 36:50.170
the physical strain on your body,

36:50.625 --> 36:53.970
there's nothing like it. It's just,
you put yourself through hell

36:54.254 --> 36:58.134
and you frighten yourself so many times,
but that is the draw.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.059
Out there
you can't fake it, you know.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.812
There's nothing you can do
that isn't putting you in the moment.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.769
This is it. You know...

37:04.889 --> 37:08.314
Especially if you ride two wheels.
This is about as difficult as it gets.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.910
You know,
people talk about extreme sports.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.114
There's nothing more extreme
than road racing.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.032
One split second.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.786
I mean, somebody like Joey Dunlop,
31 years of career,

37:25.994 --> 37:28.167
26 TT wins. All those other race wins,

37:28.168 --> 37:29.560
all those World Championships...

37:29.581 --> 37:31.174
One split second.

37:32.709 --> 37:35.633
- Oh, dearie me.
- Oh, down he goes.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.722
Oh, that throws...

37:52.604 --> 37:55.107
There is no room
for error on the TT course.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.198
Of all road-racing circuits, it is
the toughest and most unforgiving.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.362
With an average five deaths
for every mile,

38:01.529 --> 38:04.533
only a lucky few have crashed
and escaped unharmed.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.874
Milky Quayle is one of the lucky ones.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.046
Your life revolves around the TT

38:18.171 --> 38:20.344
because its such
an immense, passionate thing

38:20.507 --> 38:23.886
whether you're on the track or off
the track. It is a life and death thing.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.020
I know it sounds crazy and stuff
I mean,

38:26.054 --> 38:28.853
I've... I haven't raced around here
now for eight or nine years

38:29.307 --> 38:31.901
and I still now
struggle with life because

38:31.976 --> 38:34.946
I can't do it, you know,
I can't get me buzz.

38:34.948 --> 38:36.531
It's like you've done the ultimate

38:36.898 --> 38:39.242
and once you can't have that ultimate,

38:39.400 --> 38:42.495
then you're a bit like
a drug addict, sort of thing.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.789
You just can't, you can't
get it out of your system.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.165
You love it.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.167
When I'm sat beside the track,

38:48.493 --> 38:51.497
you just want to do it and you think,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and then...

38:52.330 --> 38:54.128
So, obviously if you keep yourself busy

38:54.290 --> 38:57.009
and whether it's blooming sweeping
the floors or emptying the bins

38:57.168 --> 39:00.547
or taking other riders round,
or meeting dignitaries

39:00.713 --> 39:04.559
and taking press round,
it keeps my mind off it, really.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.971
Milky looks after the newcomers

39:07.972 --> 39:09.598
and shows them around the course.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.892
It can take three years
of competing to learn it

39:12.016 --> 39:14.110
and at least that long
to build up the confidence

39:14.310 --> 39:16.312
needed to be able to push themselves
to the limits.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.319
It's all about confidence.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.113
You need to be confident
where the corners go

39:21.276 --> 39:22.994
and how fast
you can go round that corner

39:23.152 --> 39:25.951
to build up your speed,
so I'm still experimenting

39:26.114 --> 39:29.163
on how fast I can go, a little bit more,
a little bit more, little bit more.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.943
How to build up
and get used to the corners

39:30.952 --> 39:32.904
and the bumps and the rises
and the tipping points

39:32.912 --> 39:35.815
and the grids and everything, and
hopefully I’ll keep going a bit fasten

39:37.166 --> 39:38.509
Get over, get over!

39:38.585 --> 39:40.758
In by the hedge,
transfer back over the bike again.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.757
Into here, and guess what,

39:43.965 --> 39:45.137
there's another one here.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.228
That takes you three years to get right.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.389
After only two years
of competing,

39:51.556 --> 39:54.651
Jenny Tinmouth is the fastest
woman ever around the course.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.820
You definitely feel
like you shouldn't be doing it.

39:56.821 --> 39:58.609
It's quite bizarre. You feel...

39:59.188 --> 40:01.236
You do feel kinky, and a bit naughty.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.742
To be blasting around the roads,

40:02.942 --> 40:04.865
but again,
I think that's half the fun...

40:05.028 --> 40:07.656
Like when you set off down Bray Hill,
it's just massive big grin.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.786
It's like...

40:13.870 --> 40:15.793
As I'm coming up here,
all I'm thinking about

40:15.997 --> 40:18.591
is the next corner that's coming up,
which is called Ballagarey.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.631
It's affectionately known
as Ballascary because it is.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.676
It's so, so scary. It's so fast.

40:23.838 --> 40:24.930
It's the most important,

40:25.006 --> 40:27.179
but also the most dangerous
corner on the circuit.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.981
The big problem with Ballagarey is
it's unsighted on your entry point

40:29.982 --> 40:32.335
so as I'm coming up to here
now I'm still hard on the gas,

40:32.336 --> 40:33.711
still on the gas, still on the gas,

40:33.712 --> 40:35.054
at the 30 mile an hour sign here now,

40:35.059 --> 40:37.601
this is where I come off the gas.
I come down one gear effectively,

40:37.602 --> 40:38.894
I get my head out of the bubble,

40:38.895 --> 40:40.432
and my head's getting
ripped off my shoulders,

40:40.438 --> 40:42.907
but at that point also I'm trying
to look for my peel in point

40:42.909 --> 40:44.071
but I still can't see it.

40:44.072 --> 40:45.567
I know it goes to the right
but where do I turn in?

40:45.568 --> 40:47.195
As soon as I see the kerb on the inside,

40:47.362 --> 40:48.989
I lay the bike on its side and drive it.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.707
OK, and just fire through,
right by the kerb-

40:51.991 --> 40:53.368
So, so fast.

40:53.534 --> 40:57.038
Averaging 131. 57 miles per hour;

40:57.205 --> 41:00.425
John McGuinness is still
the fastest man around the course.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.713
A hundred years ago, the first race
was won at just 38 miles per hour.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.845
Throughout its history
even riders with no hope of winning

41:08.049 --> 41:09.801
have come to break personal bests

41:10.009 --> 41:12.262
and challenge
the island's famous course.

41:12.428 --> 41:16.433
Riders are always chasing
faster and faster lap times.

41:16.557 --> 41:19.106
...in first place.
This is Nick Crowe. He's still second.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.442
I just think it's got
a certain addiction about it.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.364
Once you get here,
you couldn't let it go then.

41:23.523 --> 41:27.369
You're looking for the ultimate
lap times all the time.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.811
I always set out to beat myself
more than anybody else.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.148
Every year, I just thought I'd do it
faster and faster and faster,

41:33.749 --> 41:34.958
which I was actually doing

41:34.959 --> 41:36.660
unfortunately until to
the time of me accident,

41:36.661 --> 41:40.256
which was really no fault of me own,
just one of those freak things.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.632
In 2009, while leading the race

41:45.753 --> 41:49.474
a hare ran onto the track,
causing Nick to crash his sidecar

41:49.632 --> 41:52.055
at 160 miles per houri

41:53.261 --> 41:56.481
I think it just came up and
damaged the front part of the fairing.

41:56.723 --> 41:59.727
And then it came and hit me
in the face and that was it then,

41:59.851 --> 42:02.980
obviously the bike turned
immediately right then, that was it,

42:03.146 --> 42:04.568
straight into the trees.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.367
Yeah, we were lucky
to get away with that one.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.578
If we have
an injury or a fatality,

42:14.741 --> 42:17.335
I tend to sort of want to stop

42:17.493 --> 42:19.962
because, yeah, I do, feel
like a drug dealer sometimes

42:20.121 --> 42:21.953
because I'm preparing
these engines for these people

42:21.956 --> 42:23.583
to go and hurt theirselves with

42:23.750 --> 42:26.494
and even though it's, you know,
touch wood, not my fault, you know,

42:26.502 --> 42:30.427
people who deal in drugs are worse
than the people who take them.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.309
And last year;
we had such a terrible time.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.642
I did say that I wouldn't carry on
with the sidecars.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.727
And then the way Nick bounced back
was just...

42:38.890 --> 42:40.437
I couldn’t say no to him at all,

42:40.600 --> 42:44.400
so we've got three engines all ready
for him, and we're doing two more.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.572
His spirit is unbelievable.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.901
Nick himself won't be riding.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.237
Instead, his own race team will attempt

42:52.403 --> 42:54.405
to break the sidecar lap record,

42:55.531 --> 42:57.954
which has stood unbroken
since his accident.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.507
Do you have to find Guy?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.384
Yeah. He's...

43:10.385 --> 43:11.832
He's got a little problem
with his license.

43:11.833 --> 43:13.340
Have you got a problem
with your license, Gary?

43:13.341 --> 43:15.764
Yeah, I've just had
to have it re-scanned.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.767
Typically, Guy is
nowhere to be found

43:18.930 --> 43:22.150
and he won't be eligible to practise
without his race license.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.190
Until he returns, the bike can't
go through scrutineering.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.026
We don't know where he is, as usual.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.190
He'll be here in a bit, hopefully.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.293
We've just had
a message from race control.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.739
Would Guy Martin please report
to the race office immediately, please.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.406
Guy Martin...

43:37.740 --> 43:38.741
Where do you start?

43:40.201 --> 43:41.544
He is a maverick.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.001
He's an eccentric. He's always
got something good to say,

43:45.100 --> 43:47.619
although a lot of the time
it comes out not broadcastable.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.717
He's a bit old school.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.675
He's a bit what we grew up with,
what we used to be.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.973
Guy is
a fabulous personality.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.513
I don't think Guy really knows
exactly what he wants to do.

43:56.514 --> 43:58.466
He's got a lot of
different loves in his life.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.267
I'd like to see
him win around here,

44:00.429 --> 44:02.523
but if he's not careful,
he'll run out of time.

44:02.682 --> 44:04.275
Guy is
a colourful character

44:04.350 --> 44:06.023
But he's an attention seeker; isn't he?

44:06.024 --> 44:08.603
He loves a bit of attention, he's had
green shorts on for two years.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.722
I mean, they must be stinking
and growing legs by now,

44:10.731 --> 44:12.228
but that's what racing is all about.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.441
We need characters in there, you know.
Guy is what he is.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.445
I mean, he talks pure rubbish,
but he's funny.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.243
Guy says it as it is,

44:18.322 --> 44:20.399
and I think that's
why he's so popular with people.

44:20.491 --> 44:25.213
He's not worried about
upsetting the hierarchy.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.421
Guy Martin is Guy Martin

44:26.581 --> 44:28.754
and nobody would want him any other way.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.220
I mean he is a true grit, he's
a John Wayne of motorcycle racing.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.433
At last, Guy returns

44:41.596 --> 44:45.226
after blowing up a friend's classic bike
in the south of the Island.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.702
- There you are, it's sorted now.
- That's all it is.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.231
Spot on! Ta very much. Cheers, boss.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.819
The roads
will be closing in half an hour

44:56.944 --> 45:00.198
and tonight's practice will start
at 7:30 prompt.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.246
Guy's race license approved,

45:02.366 --> 45:05.370
the team can finally make it through
scrutineering with the bikes.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.254
Right, cheers.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.296
And the time is now 7:25,

45:14.297 --> 45:16.175
the roads will be closing
and tonight's practice

45:16.177 --> 45:18.680
will begin in five minutes' time.

45:18.681 --> 45:21.184
Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes.

45:29.644 --> 45:32.488
Number eight, Guy Martin,
and number 19, James Hillier

45:32.489 --> 45:34.833
leave the line,
both on superbikes as well.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.344
The mechanics said last year
coming into the first pit stop

46:06.347 --> 46:07.439
me eyes were on stalks,

46:07.515 --> 46:09.917
you couldn't see
the whites of me eyes all the time.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.938
You come to the TT and your body's
unfamiliar with it to start with.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.529
Stuff's just going past
so fast.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.653
From a standing start lap, 125 mile
an hour; you know, first lap.

46:20.820 --> 46:22.914
And it’s like, "I must be mad."

46:23.781 --> 46:26.625
It is spectacular and when
you've just, you know plodding along

46:26.784 --> 46:29.486
on your road bike thinking
you are a legend riding fast.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.922
It's like a totally different thing

46:31.923 --> 46:33.675
when you see
the race bikes come through.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.330
You might have driven
to the pits that morning

46:36.335 --> 46:39.339
so your top speed for the day so far
is maybe 40 miles an hour

46:39.547 --> 46:41.800
You let the clutch out
and within a couple of miles

46:41.966 --> 46:44.310
you're pushing 200 miles
an hour between you know,

46:44.385 --> 46:45.807
stone walls and hedges.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.938
So it takes a bit
to get your head up to speed.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.601
Then you settle down
and start relaxing

46:51.767 --> 46:54.069
and getting more
and more comfortable with the circuit.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.488
You start going faster;

46:55.489 --> 46:57.148
start going smoothly,
start breathing properly.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.571
You do go into, like,
this weird sort of state of mind

46:59.734 --> 47:01.361
where everything start slowing down.

47:01.569 --> 47:04.618
You start moving,
your eyeline starts lifting so much

47:04.780 --> 47:07.784
and your brain starts working
so much ahead of yourself

47:07.950 --> 47:10.874
You're thinking, like,
maybe four or five corners ahead.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.295
It's all about momentum,

47:12.371 --> 47:13.793
and keeping your rhythm up

47:14.206 --> 47:17.130
and not getting into any stupid battles
with people.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.927
You've got to be really using your head.

47:20.379 --> 47:24.259
I'm a real hard rider
to ride with, if you want to race off me

47:24.260 --> 47:26.463
you're going to have to be
willing to wrap around a post.

47:26.469 --> 47:28.862
You know what I mean? And that's
the way I race motorbikes.

47:28.888 --> 47:31.562
And that's the way I push,
and I'll push any man to the bitter end.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.986
If they wanna play ball,
they can play with me, you know.

47:51.869 --> 47:55.373
When you listen to the bikes coming
in sixth gear...

47:55.539 --> 47:58.793
And they never close the throttle,
this is also for me, I mean...

47:58.876 --> 48:00.844
You know, I've ridden bikes
for many years...

48:00.920 --> 48:02.638
Wow! Wow! Really wow.

48:05.424 --> 48:08.052
Even after all these years
to talk to somebody about

48:08.135 --> 48:10.058
the Isle of Man TT course,

48:10.221 --> 48:13.316
the hair stands up on the back
of your neck and you remember,

48:13.724 --> 48:16.648
and I'll never ever forget
my first flying lap of the TT

48:16.727 --> 48:19.697
going over St Ninian's crossroads
down Bray Hill.

48:19.772 --> 48:21.934
And I thought I'd come off
the end of the world, really.

48:21.941 --> 48:23.934
I thought I'd ridden
off the end of a cliff

48:23.984 --> 48:25.986
You just feel you can fly really,

48:26.529 --> 48:28.372
and most of the times you do.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.019
Where's Guy, Johnny?

49:33.846 --> 49:35.473
- Where's Guy?
- Just walking up to you.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.393
Guy's bike has been impounded
because on his return,

49:39.560 --> 49:41.733
he has illegally
ridden it through the town.

49:41.734 --> 49:43.611
So I've got to go up
and get a bollocking? For what?

49:43.612 --> 49:45.857
For riding through the holding area,
or riding through the town?

49:45.858 --> 49:47.280
Riding through the town, Chief

49:47.281 --> 49:49.523
See, you're supposed to read that bit
before you go out.

49:49.528 --> 49:51.851
But I didn't see you
because you was late for the grid.

49:52.072 --> 49:54.700
That's telling you
not to do what you did.

49:58.287 --> 50:00.255
- Don't do it again.
- Really, really Mr Craig,

50:00.414 --> 50:03.588
this is where you come in.
Team boss and all that.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.002
- I'm gonna blame you, Wilson.
- Yeah, blame me.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.096
I'm blaming you, yeah.

50:09.298 --> 50:11.426
Oh, fucking mega! Where's Rob?

50:12.426 --> 50:14.178
- It would be perfect.
- No problem.

50:14.595 --> 50:15.767
More badges?

50:15.971 --> 50:17.223
Yeah, every year.

50:24.021 --> 50:27.446
Guy will get his bike back
once he apologises.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.989
Who do I go see for a bollocking?

50:30.236 --> 50:31.909
Can I take me bike?

50:32.196 --> 50:33.413
Can I take me bike?

50:33.989 --> 50:35.987
- You want some chips?
- I wouldn't mind, mate.

50:36.617 --> 50:37.960
I know you're on a diet.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.999
- Help yourself.
- Thanks very much.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.337
Go on, get in there.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.004
You're a good lad, you.

50:44.005 --> 50:45.131
Thanks, lads.

50:45.292 --> 50:46.464
You're all right, Mr Craig.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.848
All right, boss, job done.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.643
That's fucking mustard, alright, boys.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.801
Has that got
the same sprocket carrier in?

51:04.812 --> 51:05.859
Yes.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.033
J* If there's one thing that I like

51:08.034 --> 51:11.163
J* It's riding around on a motorbike

51:11.164 --> 51:13.041
J* I'm a speed king

51:13.445 --> 51:15.288
J* When I once begin

51:17.116 --> 51:19.995
J* I once won first prize two and six

51:20.160 --> 51:22.959
J* I know all the dirt track dirty tricks

51:23.122 --> 51:27.127
J* I'm a marvel
when I'm out to win

51:29.128 --> 51:32.132
J* In a 50-mile race
I am the best

51:32.339 --> 51:34.933
J* I ride five miles
and skid the rest

51:35.050 --> 51:40.056
J* So come along and see me
riding in the TT races

51:41.348 --> 51:45.353
J* Down the hill I go
at break-neck speed

51:47.187 --> 51:49.906
J* See me coming down the street

51:50.065 --> 51:52.909
J* With the winning post
on the pillion seat

51:53.068 --> 51:58.495
J* Oh! Come along and see me
riding in the TT race

51:59.074 --> 52:00.826
Absolutely, two weeks of my life.

52:01.535 --> 52:02.957
It's just something that...

52:13.172 --> 52:15.174
That, to me, is like the World Cup.

52:16.967 --> 52:20.392
It's just 50 years of my life
is 100 weeks,

52:20.393 --> 52:22.145
it's just unbelievable.

52:22.556 --> 52:25.150
The atmosphere. The friends I've made,
from all around the world,

52:25.225 --> 52:28.604
you see every year
You lose some, gain some.

52:29.021 --> 52:30.313
It's just something special.

52:30.356 --> 52:31.403
One second!

52:45.037 --> 52:47.210
People say to me,
oh, you've got children, you know,

52:47.539 --> 52:49.241
you shouldn't be allowing him to do it.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.251
But, you took racing away from Dan

52:51.335 --> 52:53.463
and it would just be
the end of Dan's world,

52:53.464 --> 52:55.181
and I can't do that to him, you know.

52:55.214 --> 52:56.466
He's my husband, I love him,

52:56.467 --> 52:57.889
so I have to support him.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.932
You're up on the Grandstand,

53:00.933 --> 53:02.845
sitting together you know,
the rest of the families

53:02.846 --> 53:05.065
and the rest of the wives.
You know, we're all nervous,

53:05.224 --> 53:06.441
but you kind of have to,

53:06.517 --> 53:08.315
sort of have a little joke and a laugh.

53:08.316 --> 53:10.710
And it's amazing the strength
that comes from within, really

53:10.711 --> 53:13.278
with all of... Everybody together,
you know, you sort of club together

53:13.279 --> 53:15.998
and get yourselves through it really.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.538
The road racers great defence
is always the same thing,

53:19.613 --> 53:21.581
every single one of them,
it's the same thing,

53:21.782 --> 53:23.374
"But it will never happen to me."

53:23.701 --> 53:27.001
But somewhere in there
they know very well

53:27.079 --> 53:28.205
that it can happen to them.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.833
And between those two places

53:31.417 --> 53:33.260
there's a lot of ways
of dealing with it.

53:33.711 --> 53:36.134
I've worn the same
crash helmet for the last 11 years.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.841
And I always wear
a certain pair of socks

53:38.924 --> 53:40.767
throughout the whole fortnight

53:41.301 --> 53:43.645
and I always drop a penny
down my leathers, as well,

53:43.721 --> 53:45.314
before the start of every race, yeah.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.019
It makes no difference whatsoever,

53:47.349 --> 53:49.727
but I'll wear pink knickers
if it's gonna make me win.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.649
Where's your pass?

53:51.650 --> 53:52.997
I ain't got either one of that.

53:53.021 --> 53:54.022
You need a pass.

53:54.857 --> 53:55.858
I ain't got om.

53:55.859 --> 53:57.285
You can't go past without a pass.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.739
- No?
- No, that's the rules.

53:59.361 --> 54:00.533
It's the pit area, you see.

54:01.071 --> 54:02.539
In the pit area, you can't.

54:03.532 --> 54:04.533
That's what you need.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.338
I'll stick it back over the fence
for you. Cheers, mate.

54:10.539 --> 54:11.540
Cheers, mate.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.344
There's no question that the
Isle of Man TT represents

54:19.506 --> 54:21.634
kind of the last bastion
of the freedom of choice

54:22.301 --> 54:23.678
and to come to a place like this

54:23.761 --> 54:26.514
and to have something
so truly, you know,

54:26.515 --> 54:27.858
potentially dangerous

54:27.931 --> 54:30.354
be welcomed, really, is refreshing.

54:30.355 --> 54:32.904
It's charming. It's all of the things
that should be allowed

54:32.978 --> 54:35.572
to go on other places.
I mean, we're human beings.

54:35.689 --> 54:37.066
Life isn't a dress rehearsal.

54:37.149 --> 54:39.277
You only get one lap,
why not make it a good one?

54:40.652 --> 54:42.599
This is where I start
the mountain climb.

54:43.363 --> 54:46.031
So, this one I have to slow down for;
back down to second gear.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.993
I get into that wall, into there,

54:48.202 --> 54:50.170
as I come through here,
the bump just there, bang.

54:50.537 --> 54:53.086
So we run now up through
this little right hand kink here,

54:53.248 --> 54:54.249
Still flat, Still flat,

54:54.250 --> 54:56.709
on the power, on the power on the power,
on the power, on the power,

54:56.710 --> 54:59.133
underneath the wall,
off the power, down one gear,

54:59.755 --> 55:02.599
back on the power, now to drive,
on the drive, drive, drive, drive,

55:04.051 --> 55:05.052
back down to second gear.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.722
Back on the power now,
pull the bike straight,

55:09.014 --> 55:10.436
get up, get up, get the driving on,

55:10.808 --> 55:12.760
up towards
these little left-hand kinks here.

55:13.101 --> 55:15.069
get into that one, into there,

55:15.800 --> 55:18.928
out towards the tree on the right hand
side of the road, right to here, OK?

55:18.941 --> 55:20.909
As we run up to that
to go on to Guthrie's, OK?

55:21.235 --> 55:24.079
Guthrie's is the third most important
corner on the circuit.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.366
Got three left hand bends here, OK.

55:26.532 --> 55:29.035
It's very steep. This is the one,
get the first one right,

55:29.409 --> 55:30.831
get into that one, into there,

55:30.911 --> 55:32.754
out to the white line,
back into number two,

55:32.996 --> 55:34.623
out to number three, just there.

55:34.957 --> 55:37.927
See the corner on the brakes hard,
down three gears, one, two, three.

55:38.919 --> 55:41.422
Back into there,
back on the power; drive it through.

55:42.297 --> 55:44.299
Right out to the white line,
back over towards

55:44.383 --> 55:45.384
the external white line,

55:45.400 --> 55:47.518
back in then,
just underneath this one just here,

55:47.553 --> 55:50.397
feathering the throttle, there we go.
Lovely. Nice wheelie.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.104
Bang.

55:56.728 --> 56:00.483
Over the next seven days, there
will be many scrapes and near misses,

56:00.566 --> 56:02.864
seven cracked vertebrae,
four broken ribs,

56:03.026 --> 56:05.700
five life-threatening incidents,
two bruised lungs

56:05.946 --> 56:08.699
and unfortunately, much worse.

56:10.617 --> 56:11.664
Where's Camee?

56:12.035 --> 56:13.036
He's in there?

56:13.287 --> 56:14.288
What's the plan?

56:17.207 --> 56:18.208
- What?
- Tea.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.960
Tea. Yeah, get his tea.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.303
And get an early start in the morning.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.340
- That the plan, Wilson?
- Sorry?

56:24.341 --> 56:26.969
What's the plan? These boys
are asking what the plan is.

56:29.469 --> 56:31.516
The plan is you're riding the bike.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.741
Ah, well, there you go.
That's it sorted. Job done.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.236
Well, obviously a fair bit
of mist up here,

56:37.311 --> 56:41.191
Douglas, at the moment around the area
here. It is clear up on the top...

56:46.445 --> 56:48.447
Starting off
with the TT Superbike race.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.040
Six laps of the course,

56:50.041 --> 56:52.590
226. 38 miles.

56:52.826 --> 56:56.501
A reminder; this is a time trial,
they go at 10 second intervals,

56:56.788 --> 56:59.337
so they're racing the clock
just as much as each other

56:59.499 --> 57:01.627
Most important, of course,
they race themselves.

57:01.835 --> 57:05.089
They race tradition, they race
the history of the mountain course.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.550
We're one minute away
from the start of racing

57:07.551 --> 57:08.768
at this year's TT

57:08.842 --> 57:11.516
The laws of averages
tell me he's going to win.

57:14.389 --> 57:16.140
I would like him to win the first race

57:16.141 --> 57:17.598
because I believe that will settle him.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.802
If he wins the first race,
he'll win three or four.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.195
I really believe in him.

57:22.314 --> 57:26.035
And it is a Suzuki that
sets us going, there goes Bruce Anstey.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.741
With mist still rolling
along Glencrutcheny Road,

57:28.820 --> 57:30.037
but we are racing.

57:30.447 --> 57:33.041
And there is the number
one machine of Bruce Anstey.

57:33.241 --> 57:35.494
And he's very compact
there through Union Mills.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.205
And there is John McGuinness,

57:37.329 --> 57:39.627
the fastest man in the history
of the mountain course.

57:39.831 --> 57:43.176
And here's Hutchy with two wins
last year; but not on a superbike-

57:43.543 --> 57:45.796
Next off is number eight,
28 years of age,

57:45.879 --> 57:46.926
here comes Guy now.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.549
He's fast down Bray Hill.

57:48.715 --> 57:49.932
Good turn speed.

57:49.933 --> 57:52.402
And here we go. We're on. Two together

57:53.679 --> 57:56.478
John McGuinness leads on the road
ahead of Bruce Anstey.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.902
Number six,
Cameron Donald, is closing the gap

58:00.903 --> 58:02.246
between him and Keith Amor

58:02.312 --> 58:03.734
They've got a battle on there,

58:03.897 --> 58:05.945
the advantage being held
by Cameron Donald

58:06.316 --> 58:08.444
but here is Guy Martin now
and he's quick!

58:10.362 --> 58:12.660
John McGuinness
has had an amazing start to this race

58:12.781 --> 58:15.409
but Conor Cummins,
the local lad, is right behind him

58:15.659 --> 58:18.253
only eight-hundredths of a second down
in second place.

58:19.300 --> 58:21.830
Back here in the Grandstand,
I can tell you from my screen

58:21.832 --> 58:25.336
that Conor Cummins has taken the lead
at Ballaugh on corrected time

58:25.419 --> 58:27.082
a three second
lead over John McGuinness.

58:27.087 --> 58:29.556
But John clearly has problems because

58:29.715 --> 58:31.012
at the Sulby speed trap

58:31.091 --> 58:35.267
he's gone through
at only 136.4 miles an hour

58:35.345 --> 58:38.770
So, clearly problems with
John McGuinness and the big Honda.

58:38.932 --> 58:40.980
But up to Ramsey and Roy Moore.

58:40.981 --> 58:42.977
Well, they said it was
going to be close and it is,

58:42.978 --> 58:45.231
cos Guy Martin's here...
Oh, my goodness!

58:45.397 --> 58:47.491
Guy Martin was nearly taken out there

58:47.566 --> 58:49.284
by Michael Dunlop, and it was close.

58:49.285 --> 58:50.537
Conor Cummins, number 10,

58:50.610 --> 58:52.738
leads by six seconds
before Ian Hutchinson.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.994
It's then in third place Guy Martin,

58:55.073 --> 58:56.666
just one second down on Hutchinson.

58:56.742 --> 58:59.586
John McGuinness
is a retirement on Sulby Straight.

58:59.786 --> 59:00.878
What a disappointment,

59:00.954 --> 59:03.457
the king of the mountain
is out on the first lap

59:03.623 --> 59:04.875
but on with the show.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.878
Number four who is leading on the road.

59:08.170 --> 59:10.969
I can tell you that number 10
has increased his lead to 14 seconds

59:10.970 --> 59:12.313
over number four; Ian Hutchinson.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.726
We could see a Manxman
on the top of the podium

59:14.801 --> 59:16.394
for the first time for several years.

59:16.762 --> 59:19.811
Cummins has got that fantastic
lead now 21 seconds.

59:19.812 --> 59:22.636
If he can just hang it together
there will certainly be some Guinness

59:22.642 --> 59:24.485
drunk in the Swan in Ramsey tonight.

59:25.771 --> 59:29.821
And Ian Hutchinson's
lap time, 130.496,

59:30.025 --> 59:31.868
So here's Conor now,
let's have a look at this.

59:32.360 --> 59:36.706
Oh, it's 131.511 by Conor Cummins.

59:36.948 --> 59:40.122
And, wow, what a performance
by the man from Ramsey.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.040
Well, the light came on at Cronk-ny-Mona

59:45.165 --> 59:47.463
to signal the arrival
of number six, Cameron Donald,

59:47.626 --> 59:49.219
but he's failed to appear

59:49.461 --> 59:52.055
Now we reckon that Cameron may have
made a mistake on that lap,

59:52.056 --> 59:53.854
possibly an overshoot at Signpost

59:54.091 --> 59:56.469
That seems one logical explanation
for that.

59:56.885 --> 59:58.728
We've just got
another machine coming in now,

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.176
and that'd be Guy Martin is in now,

01:00:00.177 --> 01:00:02.090
Guy's just coming in to
the top of the pit lane now

01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.183
and it's Conor's that's on the way
as he's just being told there.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.686
Bring it home, Conor; bring it home.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.363
He knows he's got
a 21.1 lead at Glen Helen.

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.490
On this lap, 23.3.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.030
Well, there's the klaxon going,
Hutchy leaves now.

01:00:13.031 --> 01:00:15.580
And Cameron, he'll be kicking himself
for that mistake,

01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:19.051
he's now dropped to 13th.
Oh, Conor stalls! Conor stalls!

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:21.914
Is he gonna get it going here now,
it just won't fire up-

01:00:21.915 --> 01:00:23.558
Quite a bit of time. Come on, come on,

01:00:23.588 --> 01:00:25.886
come on, come on, oh, no, no, no.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.089
It's fired, it's fired!

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:30.419
Oh, Conor; a big shake of the head
from the big man from Ramsey there.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:33.881
Guy Martin goes as well, and Guy's fast
into the speed limiter there,

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.640
and nails it. Charlie Lambert.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.259
So, a 21 second lead,

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.557
and all of a sudden
it was down to four seconds.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.560
Seventeen seconds disappeared
during the course of that problem,

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.850
of getting the big ZX-10 fired up again.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.069
So, ifs all to play for
then in the final two laps

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.897
and there's some work
to be done by Cameron

01:00:49.898 --> 01:00:51.400
to eat into Conor's lead.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.280
So, Conor Cummins, Ian Hutchinson,

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:57.784
Guy Martin and Michael Dunlop,
those are the top four

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:02.535
The order is the same, but the gap
has most certainly changed.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.421
First of the late-numbered runners now
in pit lane.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.464
And here's number 26, Paul Dobbs,

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.421
racing with the kiwi on his helmet

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.922
and there's Jenny, away now.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.471
And we've just had
news that Conor's missing.

01:01:14.472 --> 01:01:16.270
Conor Cummins
missing here at Glen Helen.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.134
Waved yellows out here as
a new machine comes into view now.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.303
No, it's not Conor; either.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.307
That's number eight, Guy Martin.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.058
Conor missing at Glen Helen.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.555
I can tell you
what's happened to Conor

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:39.663
He's a retirement,
mechanical failure at Laurel Bank.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.494
A retirement at Laurel Bank.
A mechanical failure.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.334
Huge disappointment there for Conor

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.626
So it's Ian Hutchinson,
number four who's leading on the road.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.627
There's number eight, Guy Martin
into second place for now.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.178
And there's one,
two, three into view now.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.853
Those three are going to have
a real old scrap over the mountain

01:01:57.854 --> 01:01:59.590
and that's going to be
well worth looking at.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:01.343
It's not only Conor
that has bad news.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.892
We've just heard that the
new timing system here in the pits

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.140
has claimed
its first-high profile victim

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:09.602
with Guy Martin picking up
a 30-second time penalty.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.358
That's moved him down from
what would have been second place

01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:14.703
down to fourth place. So, off the podium

01:02:14.704 --> 01:02:18.425
for Guy and Ian Hutchinson, the
30-year-old from Bingley in Yorkshire

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.403
is the leader of the Superbike TT

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.664
with Michael Dunlop now in second place.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:26.163
I know it's Hutchy winning, but keep
an eye on number six, Cameron Donald,

01:02:26.164 --> 01:02:28.132
despite that excursion at Signpost

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.043
finishing the race very strongly indeed

01:02:30.044 --> 01:02:32.672
and that final place on the podium
is not nailed just yet.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.632
You can see the chequered flag
is now being prepared.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.383
Here comes
the wheelie of Ian Hutchinson,

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.268
and Ian Hutchinson wins
on the Padgett's Honda.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.439
The final result sheet,
Hutchy one, Dunlop two, Donald three,

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.438
and Guy Martin
finishing in fourth place.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.237
And it was a time penalty
that cost Guy so dearly.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.405
So, when I was in pit lane,
I heard him announce

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:59.530
that Guy had gone through
the speed lane too fast

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:03.197
and there was a time penalty
against him, now that's all I've heard.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.123
We just lost second place.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.869
When Guy was told he just
jumped off the bike, got into his van.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:10.713
He didn't even take his helmet off

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.499
But I'm sure he'll
come back again, you know.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.426
It's a big disappointment to Guy.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:21.132
You know, he'd just done
224 miles at those speeds

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.933
and then told we are
penalizing you for nothing.

01:03:24.175 --> 01:03:27.770
Such a tiny thing. Point one over 60.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.353
There shouldn't be a 30-second penalty.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:31.975
Five, possibly.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:33.893
That's harsh.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.731
They're measuring
the average speed over a distance.

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:41.110
Now who's to say that their distance
that they're measuring over

01:03:41.111 --> 01:03:42.533
is accurate to within a millimetre?

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.995
We have books full of regulations,
by the way.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.542
And unfortunately,
I perhaps also ought to say,

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.044
that in the matter of time-keeping

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.998
the timekeeper, his word is law

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:59.132
and he records what are then considered
to be matters of fact

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.296
from which there is
no protest or appeals.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:05.342
OK.

01:04:05.343 --> 01:04:07.851
Yeah, well, that's it.
Monday's a new day, innit, and you know,

01:04:07.852 --> 01:04:09.303
Guy's got another two races on Monday

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.773
so you know as long as Guy turns up
this evening, open-minded,

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.691
and puts today's race behind him,

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.315
you know, he's got another
superbike race as well on Friday.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.606
And, you know,
we'll just move on from it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.458
Welcome to Monday's
action on the mountain course.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:38.713
Two races, 600cc machines
are off first at 10:45.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.796
Guy Martin
has blitzed them from the start.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.847
At Ballaugh, Guy Martin
is still leading the race by

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:51.726
just over a second from Ian Hutchinson,
with Dan Kneen in third place.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.316
Guy Martin is here at
Ramsey hairpin, lap one,

01:04:55.317 --> 01:04:57.740
and he still leads
and he looks determined today.

01:04:57.741 --> 01:04:59.804
News from the top
of the mountain, from the Bungalow,

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.191
is that Ian Hutchinson has
halved the gap on Guy Martin.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:05.277
And here's Ian Hutchinson who leads
at the end of the first lap.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.530
Guy Martin obviously
likes that stretch of course

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.158
between the Grandstand and here
because he's consistently quicker.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:13.701
But Hutchy seems to get it
on him on him everywhere else.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.209
It's trouser-bulging excitement
here.

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.540
Guy Martin
is leading the race.

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.500
Now Ian Hutchinson
has gone back into the lead.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.085
It's Guy Martin
back into the lead.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.920
There's Hutchy now, leading on the road.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.718
Oh, as quick as that.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.518
Charlie, what's the difference
as Guy comes in?

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:31.720
3.3 seconds so Hutchy
has been going away a little bit.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:34.184
Guy Martin's being told
there, "You can do this,"

01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:36.687
and I'm sure there's thousands
out there who would like him to do this.

01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:37.905
Get out the fucking way.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.028
Did Guy have problems there
on the way?

01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:41.100
We heard a lot of shouting.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.232
Guy goes through with
Keith Amor hot on his tail.

01:05:43.233 --> 01:05:44.860
Michael Dunlop
slots into third.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.114
But, here's Ian Hutchinson
who's extended the lead.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.454
There's now over four seconds,
but stand by your beds

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:52.703
because the news from Ballaugh is that
Guy Martin has halved the gap.

01:05:52.704 --> 01:05:54.581
Ian Hutchinson is coming
towards the end of the race

01:05:54.582 --> 01:05:57.677
but Guy Martin has now got it down
to less than three seconds at the Cronk

01:05:57.678 --> 01:05:59.525
and Guy Martin
is having the lap of his life!

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.760
But is it going to be enough to give him
his first victory here at the TT

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.136
And Hutchy crosses the line
right now, but where is Guy?

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.384
He started 40 seconds after Hutchy.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.639
We've started the stopwatch,

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.591
and we're going to be
counting it all the way down

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:12.765
from those 40 seconds. 37... 38...

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:15.723
It's 39...
It is victory for Ian Hutchinson.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.901
By 3.03 seconds.
Guy Martin is in second place.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:26.109
Michael Dunlop is in third place,
with a final lap of 126. 587.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:29.156
The one, two, three is Hutchinson,
Martin and Michael Dunlop.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.529
And it's down to Chris Kinley.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.410
I don't know
where Guy got to, actually.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.620
I can tell you he went
straight up the return

01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:40.370
and that is as much as
we know at the moment.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:43.375
So Guy did not come
into the winners' enclosure.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:44.960
He went straight up the return,

01:06:44.961 --> 01:06:46.588
we’ll have to find out
what's going on there.

01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:47.681
Charles, did you see him?

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.257
The people who made the rules,
it's nothing to do with us.

01:06:50.258 --> 01:06:53.182
Paul's trying to do his job,
you know what I mean, it's not Paul,

01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:54.306
Paul doesn't make the rules.

01:06:54.307 --> 01:06:55.775
Now this is me being picky.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.268
Guy, we're all
really proud of you, so just please...

01:06:58.269 --> 01:07:00.146
For Wilson. Please. Please. Please.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.614
Get yourself together, Guy.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.292
- Wouldn't you be peeved?
- Yeah, Guy, I'd be upset

01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:10.689
but I wouldn't take it out on the people

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:11.990
who are supposed to be me mates.

01:07:11.991 --> 01:07:13.459
Point one-one-two...

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guy! Guy!
Brakes, front brakes! Front brakes!

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:19.956
Gonna hold his bum in a minute.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.046
Now then, boss, where'd you go?

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.374
60.112.

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:26.416
That's you boys being picky.
This is me being picky.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.869
I'll do what I want at my speed.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.960
So this is Saturday's race
you're on about, isn't it?

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:30.964
Yeah. Yeah...

01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:33.588
I'll let you get down the bottom there
we'll have a longer chat later on.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.639
OK, Guy? Thank you very much,
Guy's off there now.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.229
So that was a bit of
a Guy Martin protest we saw there,

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.312
you going straight in?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.653
If I walked
at .112 of a kilometre an hour

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.016
do you know how far I'd go?

01:07:50.017 --> 01:07:52.766
.112 of a kilometre,
how far's that, the length of this here.

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.745
Get a grip, man, get a grip.
30 seconds...

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:10.837
There's the applause.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.932
And richly deserved, as well,
it's been a terrific morning's racing,

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.560
and these guys will remember
this for one reason or another

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.687
for a very long time.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.729
But Guy Martin is not hanging around
at the top of the podium,

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:26.652
he's already making his way down.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.830
He's taking his bottle
of bubbly with him, though.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.948
Tell me a bit how you feel.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:36.029
They're being awkward with me,
I'll be awkward with them.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.822
They just do things... They want you,
"You can't do this, you can't do that."

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.542
You know, "Press this, press that."
Fuck off.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.492
They've been awkward with me,
I'll be fucking awkward with them.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.462
That simple. No problem.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.173
No problem. Don't worry,
that's only the tip of the iceberg.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.755
You wait till I win a fucker.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.019
I didn't even think about it really,
I just agree with them.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:57.166
You're better off. All I say was just
sour grapes, anything at all that I say.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.301
I could've said out.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.728
So I had to do an interview
yesterday morning...

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.822
I just said,
"I was happy to finish fourth.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.724
"Happy. It's where I wanted to be."

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.809
Obviously not,
I wanted to win it, didn't I?

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.894
But they're not helping you with
dickheads like that, are they?

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:09.895
Oh, well.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.157
Worse things happen at sea,
we're still here aren't we?

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.281
I thought it went rather well.

01:09:16.282 --> 01:09:19.286
Obviously not well enough,
cos Hutchy beat me.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.412
Yeah, I know what needs to be done.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.452
But there's another three
races left yet, isn't there?

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.831
It'll come.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.636
There is the race leader
Ryan Farquhar really looking dialled in.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.736
Something must have gone wrong
at the start for Guy

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.258
he was well outside the top 10.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:44.139
It's Hutchy's victory by 1.3 seconds.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.770
Hutchy, Ryan and Conor; in that order

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:50.688
it's hat trick Hutchy
winning three TT's in a week.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:53.356
And there are still two solo TT's to go.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.692
I just gave it
absolutely everything I could.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:58.449
And, it's just unbelievable, man,
unbelievable.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.284
Hello?

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:42.492
All right, driver. Who are you?

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:45.492
What do you know?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.161
No.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.893
Yeah, just sat watching
some onboards playing,

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.257
getting a plan of attack sorted.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.173
Jeffries is from 2002

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:58.337
and then bits of Hutchy.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.386
I'm going through
the tight sections too hot,

01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:03.685
and then I'm losing the run
onto the long straights.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.986
- You want it?
- OK, thank you.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.862
- Can you sign here?
- All right love, how's it going?

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.035
- Going great.
- Good lass.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.957
Hope you get the race.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.789
I know. Let's hope so, eh?

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.781
I've just seen Paul Dobbs,

01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:34.534
let’s maybe go
and have a word with Dobbs.

01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:36.096
- Good morning, Paul.
- How you doing?

01:11:36.097 --> 01:11:37.815
What about today's conditions?
I bet you were sat

01:11:37.816 --> 01:11:40.128
when you woke up this morning and
you must have thought, "Oh, no."

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.551
No, teammates
with Oatsey this year

01:11:41.552 --> 01:11:43.520
and he assures me
that it's gonna come right, so...

01:11:43.521 --> 01:11:45.458
All right, Paul, I’ll let you
get it together and get warm,

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:46.469
he looks freezing.

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.758
You're looking as if
you're not ready for a race, either

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:50.936
Nowhere near.
I mean, yeah, it's not safe is it?

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.317
No, so you can't go racing in that.
I ain't racing.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:58.564
There you go, love.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.073
Guy! Guy!

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:04.488
Guy, she fancies you!

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.590
...as Guy Martin goes
through in fourth place.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.193
There goes Hutchy,
looking very strong.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.262
Keith Amor on the pace
is in third.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.472
Michael Dunlop
is here and he still leads.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:33.600
But only by 1.82 seconds.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:37.111
The difference is only 1.82 seconds.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.109
No, I think Hutchy
has done it...

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.283
He has, because
Michael Dunlop crosses the line,

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.819
but it is Ian Hutchinson
who has won the race.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:45.903
And not just that.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:49.286
He has made the most amazing
piece of history here today.

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:52.877
The first man in history
to win the first four TT races.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.996
And only the second man,

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.590
after Phillip McCallen,
to win four in a week.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.673
Ian Hutchinson,
the new king of the mountain.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.052
No question about that.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.932
James McBride away now.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.473
Next away will be
New Zealand's finnest Paul Dobbs,

01:13:13.474 --> 01:13:15.226
and right behind him
is Welshman Paul Owen.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.686
Great to see the man
from Llangollen here once again.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.816
Well,
we were on the start line,

01:13:19.817 --> 01:13:21.354
and then you shake hands with your mate

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.699
and always wish him all the best.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.906
I set off behind my mate, Paul Dobbs.

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.284
Because you're 10 seconds apart,

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:32.412
you can count them
when they just disappear

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.202
You start counting.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.207
You can hear them coming
down from the campsite down in the dip

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:15.210
and then back up. You can hear
them speed coming up there.

01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:17.384
And you can tell the men from the boys

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.624
because they gear down,
they drop a cog down

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.718
and then they ease off
slightly, then they open it up

01:14:23.719 --> 01:14:25.642
and rip it around the corner.

01:14:25.643 --> 01:14:27.545
But I have to say, the top boys,
they just don't bother.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.047
They just keep it going flat.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.726
He just came round the corner so well,

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.019
clipped it,

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:36.931
the bike went
the height of the bus stop.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.691
It just went straight up,

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.235
the height of the bus stop
that's down there.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.062
Like a battleground.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:45.781
I was just closing on him

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.950
and then we were
just coming up to Ballagarey

01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:50.454
and I just seen him
go off into the corner

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.825
and then the yellow flags came out
so I knew that there'd been an incident.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.664
Either he'd blown
the engine or crashed so,

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.496
I could like hear the other riders
coming so I just grabbed a flag

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:02.957
and just ran into the track
to slow the other riders down.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.506
The medics tried
everything they could for him.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:10.758
But he'd have been cheesed off
if he'd have been in a car

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.263
and got squashed by a tractor
or summat like that, like.

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:16.350
Like, we're here, we race.
We know the dangers.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:19.106
It's not tiddlywinks or whatever

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.776
That's why everybody gets on
if you can help each other.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:23.769
But sadly,

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:26.109
he lost his life
to the sport that he loves.

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:32.741
Just one of them, like.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:44.048
I had one of those moments,
you know, that happen at some point

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.966
once or twice during every TT fortnight,

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:49.922
when I just stand and look around
and everything you see, the bikes,

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:54.472
the overalls, you know you hear
that siren, pit-entry siren.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.813
Everything going on
and I just thought, I love this.

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:03.977
And I actually thought,
a stupid moment of clarity,

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:08.861
God, I'd miss this if I couldn't have it
cos something happens to Dobbsy.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:12.819
An hour later...

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.327
Anyone could lose
their partner tomorrow.

01:16:20.328 --> 01:16:24.424
People step out under a bus.
People are lost every day.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.841
You talk about that, and you joke
about it all the time, you know.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.296
I might not be here next week,
is what people say.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.552
But when it is part
of your consciousness,

01:16:33.553 --> 01:16:35.726
even a subconscious part,

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.601
it really does make you love life.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.689
It makes you appreciate who you've got

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.687
and what's special about them

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.268
and just how lucky you are.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.566
The reason we make
that choice to go racing

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.198
is just the whole, you know,

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.778
"We're here for a good time."

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.330
What can, you know, how can we
get the most fun out of life?

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.292
And, we want the kids
to share that as well.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.579
They come along, they love it,
they're part of it.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.874
Because we had that time with him,
it's made us who we are.

01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:09.172
It's made them who they are.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.884
You know, they're incredible.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.889
Um, they're strong. They're fun.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.267
And we have fun.
You know, we have so much fun.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.261
It doesn't stop.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:23.723
And we're going to keep on having fun,
you know.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:27.234
Ride the bikes, play the music,
dance in the kitchen.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.445
We still love the TT
still love the island,

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:31.948
you can't change that.

01:17:31.949 --> 01:17:34.418
You can't love the death.
You can't love the loss.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:37.908
But you can't love
the excitement and the thrill

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:40.823
without knowing that that's part of it.

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:45.203
It wouldn't be so exciting
if it didn't have the risk.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:48.255
That's why they want to do it.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.762
Meanwhile,
the Auto Cycle Union has confirmed

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:07.191
a second rider was killed
in yesterday's Supersport 2 race.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.525
48-year-old Austrian Martin Loicht died
in a crash at Quarry Bends...

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.990
This is Friday, Senior day.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.738
This is the day
we've all been waiting for

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.121
it's the final,
and it's the race of the year,

01:18:20.122 --> 01:18:21.214
as far as we're concerned.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.624
The big prize. People call it
"The Power and the Glory".

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:25.959
It just means so much.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:30.006
So we will be putting a big effort
into this, a huge effort.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.462
Everyone's ready. And Guy is up for it.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.591
He's just arrived.
That's him.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:40.136
On the dirty old bicycle, the pushbike.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.436
Who's going to take
this year's Senior title?

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.688
Will it be an unbelievable
five for Ian Hutchinson?

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:49.771
Can John McGuinness
make it onto the podium?

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:54.648
I've had a second, had a fourth
yesterday, I had a fifth.

01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:58.654
And so I've not had the best of weeks,
really. A few little issues

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.490
in the way of just bike setup.

01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:02.164
But it's all food for thought,

01:19:02.165 --> 01:19:05.260
and I've got to try and take
it through into today's race

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.326
and go play the part, see what I can do.

01:19:07.327 --> 01:19:08.660
I'm going to go out
there and try my hardest.

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.504
But then sometimes
I've been watching onboards,

01:19:10.505 --> 01:19:12.303
I've been watching
this and watching that.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:13.791
And am I trying too hard?

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.964
And I think I look in a couple
of places, and I am.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.195
And that's what's holding me back, so...

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.427
Yeah, I'll pull me finger out.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.679
That penalty, I didn't
feel really hard done by.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.342
Worse things happen at sea.
I just came and sat in here

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.010
with me helmet and me boots
and me gloves and me leathers

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.764
and all that shit on,
and just sat here and...

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:30.431
At the time, if someone
would have come in here,

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.526
if Mr Speed-gun Man
or whatever had come in here

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.024
I'd have thrashed fuck out of him.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:39.905
But, really, Mr Speed-gun Man,
I'd have thrashed fuck out of him.

01:19:39.906 --> 01:19:42.750
I'm not a fighting man, but there's
a time and a place for everything.

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:44.924
And something like that's going on.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.374
Point... Whatever, don't
even get me started on it.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:52.959
I've won four so far,
and it'd be great to get the fifth.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.166
You know, it'd be the fairytale story.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:20:00.217
But, obviously, everyone's been
gunning out to get me all week.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:03.516
And I think in some respects,
the pressure's kind of off them

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:06.310
with it just being one person
that's done it all week.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:07.477
What more can they do?

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.352
It's not as if you know, there's
been four different winners

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.516
and they haven't won one, it's just...

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.895
I think maybe the pressure
is off them a little bit, but...

01:20:15.896 --> 01:20:19.366
On the other side of it,
it's the last race this year.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:23.073
You know, if they really are determined
to win a TT this year,

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.904
this is the last chance.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.740
I haven't seen one of
those Conor Cummins posters around yet,

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.459
but there'll be a big groundswell
of support for the local boy.-.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.286
If you go out there
with your head riled,

01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:33.914
if I listen to Rage Against The Machine
before I go out,

01:20:33.915 --> 01:20:35.087
you're going out
with the wrong frame of mind.

01:20:35.088 --> 01:20:36.372
So I'm gonna go out there
listening to...

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:39.001
I think I might have a bit of
Otis Redding on before I go out.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.045
Yeah, smoke me 10 Bensons.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:44.598
Do you want 10 Bensons?

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:45.929
That'll do you, will it?

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.395
Yeah, I'm only taking up smoking...
I'm taking up smoking after July.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.101
But there's been a few moments
in this past couple of weeks

01:20:52.102 --> 01:20:53.820
where I've just thought...

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:58.772
But I've not smoked, so I think
a bit of Otis Redding on the start line,

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.315
pretend to smoke a fag,

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:04.200
and take it as it comes.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:12.585
Well the parade lap
is coming to its conclusion here.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.961
We're going to have
the senior TT race going

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.789
in just under an hour's time

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:18.131
at half past 12,

01:21:18.132 --> 01:21:20.476
and we will, of course,
give you all the build up

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.136
and the interviews
as the riders get out there.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.202
Can history be made by Ian Hutchinson?

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:53.329
He's proved himself to be
an absolute maestro

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:55.173
around the mountain course.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.588
And there is the number one machine
of Bruce Anstey.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:22:01.588
The lap record still standing
at 131.578 miles an hour.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:04.671
That was set by John McGuinness
last year. Less than 10 seconds to go.

01:22:04.672 --> 01:22:07.846
Well, I can tell the members of
the Guy Martin fan club over there

01:22:07.847 --> 01:22:09.565
on the far side of Glencrutchery Road

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.601
that their man is
still one of the favourites,

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:14.722
along with the big local hope,
number 10, Conor Cummins.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.858
The last few seconds tick away.

01:22:21.859 --> 01:22:24.032
We watch the flag, which drops,
and we are now racing.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.359
Bruce Anstey.
Mountain Maestro John McGuinness.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.079
Now number three Ian Lochear
That's Hutchy on the number four

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.048
Keith Amor goes. And Cameron Donald.

01:22:31.049 --> 01:22:32.722
So Michael is away on the Honda.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.783
Guy Martin on the Wilson Craig Honda.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.119
Guy's off and racing.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.376
But I can tell you that
when we look to the scoreboard

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.630
to see that Guy Martin,
number eight, leads.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:51.434
But only by .4 or .5 of a second
from number 10, Conor Cummins.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:54.307
There is only .06 of a second then

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.564
between him and
number four Ian Hutchinson,

01:22:56.638 --> 01:23:00.233
with John McGuinness
just .74 of a second down on him.

01:23:00.234 --> 01:23:03.204
So one and a half seconds
cover the top four here.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:06.156
And a tight line in
from number eight, Guy Martin.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.400
A hundred and thirty one mile
an hour lap for Guy.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:13.581
131.108, that's Guy Martin's fastest lap
ever around the mountain course.

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.457
And he's absolutely on song today.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:20.454
It's all about those guys
on the eight and 10 plates,

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:23.962
Guy Martin and Conor Cummins,
but it's so close right behind them,

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:27.253
Hutchy and John McGuinness
are right there in the mix.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.559
And Conor has gone into the lead.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.937
Conor has snatched
the lead from Guy Martin

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.689
but there's 0.58 seconds in it.

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.542
It's down to fractions of seconds,

01:24:44.543 --> 01:24:47.171
because at the Bungalow,
Guy Martin has narrowed the gap

01:24:47.172 --> 01:24:51.268
on Conor Cummins to just one-tenth
of a second. That's all there is.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.422
It's still desperately,
desperately tight.

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.719
It's Guy right
in front of me here now,

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.722
red torpedo on the back of his leathers.

01:24:57.723 --> 01:24:59.010
Just watch that speed! Go on...

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.355
And Guy Martin,
let me just give you his details.

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.020
130.642,

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.568
and he was the race leader
at Cronk-ny-Mona,

01:25:06.569 --> 01:25:09.038
but we're still waiting for Conor
Conor's here now.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:11.277
130.278.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.318
A brand new tyre in
for Guy as he fires up and he is away.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:17.071
Right now we saw a great pit stop
by the Wilson Craig team

01:25:17.072 --> 01:25:18.779
and it's the McAdoo boys
who are on it now.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.781
Tighten her up, Mark, and

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.117
Mark just says go, go, go, go.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.543
She fires and the big man is away now.

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:29.337
Here he is.
Here's Guy Martin now!

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:47.066
But there was
an awful long gap there

01:25:47.067 --> 01:25:50.537
in between Hutchinson and Michael Dunlop
and Keith Amor appearing here,

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.982
and the road goes quiet here
for a moment or two.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:55.742
But we're still waiting
on machine number eight.

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.129
And here's Conor at number 10,

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:13.461
so we don't appear
to have a Guy Martin here.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:15.136
Guy Martin is missing.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.180
Red flag.
Attention, attention. Red flag.

01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:19.090
Well, back here at
the grandstand, we're not sure

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:22.265
if we've got a red-flag situation.
The race has been stopped

01:26:22.266 --> 01:26:24.610
because a fire engine
has to go onto the track.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.024
It's clearly something very serious
at Ballagarey.

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:30.103
It's only the second Senior race
in 100 years to be red-flagged.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.613
Incident at Ballagarey.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.819
Guy Martin hasn't reached Glen Helen.

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.903
Red flag, boys. Red flag.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:49.334
We believe it's Guy Martin. He's crashed
and the bike has set fire to a field,

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.962
and that's one of the only times
they'll put red flags out.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.492
it's gut-wrenching
for everyone.

01:26:53.493 --> 01:26:54.965
The team are pacing up and down,

01:26:54.968 --> 01:26:58.142
you can see the team boss' head down,
not knowing what's going on.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.432
I mean, nobody knows
any better than anybody.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:04.803
First we knew about it was
when Guy didn't arrive at Glen Helen.

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:07.356
You'd like to think
that it's a mechanical failure

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:08.648
rather than a crash.

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:13.904
But then we heard the hedge
was on fire at Glen Vine...

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:18.067
Only riders and officials
are allowed in the parc fermé area.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:21.328
Everybody else out, please. Thank you.

01:27:21.329 --> 01:27:23.872
You could see the fire
in the distance about a mile away.

01:27:23.873 --> 01:27:25.921
There was smoke and one of the hay bales
was on fire

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.164
and they slowed us way down
and I thought, "OK,

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.621
"well, there's a hay bale on Ere,"

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:32.672
and, "There's the bike
in somebody's yard."

01:27:32.673 --> 01:27:34.516
And I'm like, "OK
we're past the incident."

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.137
A quarter-mile later there was Guy.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.757
And I was like, "Oh, shit."

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:47.013
There was an incident.
Guy was missing so it had to be him.

01:27:47.014 --> 01:27:49.858
He crashed at something
like 170 miles an hour,

01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:51.702
cos he was off at that speed

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:53.565
and, of course, you worry.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:56.025
You know, you don't jump from a bike

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.697
at 170 miles an hour and get up again.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.447
So, yes, we are worried.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.491
Paul Dobbs crashed there last night,
and, you know, he didn't make it.

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.746
So, fingers crossed for Guy.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.414
It's hit and miss there, you know.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:13.498
There's no run-out, as there isn't
anywhere on the circuit here.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:16.925
Guy seems to have made a little bit
of a rider error sort of thing

01:28:16.926 --> 01:28:18.473
and he's gone into the wall.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.170
It's not looking good.

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:22.180
I came up on the circuit,

01:28:22.181 --> 01:28:25.090
you know, it just looks like
a bomb's exploded when owt goes on here.

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:26.968
The wall and all the bales were on fire,

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:28.761
you Know, and Guy's
laid there in the track,

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:31.060
his bike's split in pieces, like it's...

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.233
It's horrendous, yeah, we...

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.903
Everyone's fingers are crossed
at the minute, to see how Guy is.

01:28:36.904 --> 01:28:42.957
So quarter past two, for
a 3:00 start to a four-lap Senior race.

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.448
It's just how it is,
sort of thing.

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.952
We all enter it. There's no gun
to our heads to enter.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:50.163
We all love it, and at the end
of the day, if it goes wrong

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:53.371
and the worst does happen,
then he died a happy man, like.

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:58.926
You know, the show's going on.
We've got four laps coming here.

01:28:58.927 --> 01:29:00.600
We're a 3:00 start.

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:03.092
No. It'll be no slower.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.259
Now let's give you
the track conditions.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.513
Roads. Lack of adhesion at Ballagarey

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:12.602
Dry around the rest of the course.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.766
Visibility good. Four lap race.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.726
Got me fingers crossed
for Conor today.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.775
He'll be out there giving
it the berries, as usual.

01:29:19.776 --> 01:29:22.153
I'm right behind you,
Conan if you're listening.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.954
Four laps, 150.92 miles.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:36.042
John McGuinness, the race leader
in the race before it was abandoned

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:38.670
is away on number two.
This is Ian Hutchinson.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.335
And now number 10, Conor Cummins,

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:44.463
looking so good for
the first couple of laps.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:48.141
He's got to keep it together
for the full race today.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.468
And here comes the first
of those machines, it is McGuinness.

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.142
Here's Hutchy now, 0.61,

01:29:53.143 --> 01:29:54.814
that's all there is
between the two of them.

01:29:54.815 --> 01:29:57.614
I'm sad to report Michael
is in retirement at Joey's.

01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:59.360
And Cameron is off the bike.

01:29:59.361 --> 01:30:01.363
Here's Conor now. Head down.

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:04.567
So the big news here
at Glen Helen. Lap two.

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.902
McGuinness appears to be out.

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.703
And there's 3.24 seconds

01:30:08.778 --> 01:30:11.156
that Ian Hutchinson leads
number 10, Conor Cummins.

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:34.055
Back here at the Grandstand,
we have got a situation at the Bungalow

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:37.186
where Ian Hutchinson
retains the lead of the race.

01:30:37.187 --> 01:30:39.360
We're waiting for Conor
to appear at the Bungalow

01:30:39.361 --> 01:30:41.409
before we can update that.

01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:43.959
News of Conor Cummins,
he came off at the Veranda

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:45.365
and he's receiving attention.

01:30:45.366 --> 01:30:47.118
So, Conor off at the Veranda.

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:51.242
Ian Hutchinson crosses the line
and rides into the history books.

01:30:51.243 --> 01:30:55.248
Forget the famous five,
this is the fabulous, fantastic five

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.752
by the Bingley Bullet Ian Hutchinson,

01:30:57.753 --> 01:31:01.098
30 years of age.
He has rewritten the history books

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:04.543
of one of the greatest
motorsport events in the world.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:19.892
Again it was
the sound and the blurt

01:31:19.893 --> 01:31:21.395
But the blur stopped.

01:31:21.396 --> 01:31:23.227
He was coming around the corner
A good race line,

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:24.853
really good race line
in all fairness to him,

01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.276
and he was flying round.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:30.160
The bike comes down,
he kicks the bike away

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:34.615
and the bike literally
turns into a fireball on impact.

01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:40.666
It's like the start of a IV programme,
an all-action IV programme

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.622
where the screen is filled with flames,

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:44.420
and this silhouette comes towards us

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:46.467
at about waist height, and it's Guy.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.467
And I'm thinking,
"Oh, here we go, I got a job here."

01:31:49.468 --> 01:31:50.936
First thing that springs to mind.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:55.477
So I reached down, grabbed
my orange box, the med box.

01:31:55.478 --> 01:31:57.606
I turned around there
and Guy's flying past me

01:31:57.607 --> 01:32:01.487
followed by a bike which is on fire
and it just screams past me

01:32:01.488 --> 01:32:04.287
and then the bike goes over to one side
and it's still in flames

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.446
and there's black smoke everywhere.

01:32:06.447 --> 01:32:08.105
And flames, they make a
hell of a mess, don't they?

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:09.153
And Guy's in the middle.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.694
I tell him, "I'm not
gonna cut your leathers,

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.697
"cos I need to check you over
first of all."

01:32:15.698 --> 01:32:17.871
And he says, "No, don't cut my leathers,
don't cut my leathers."

01:32:17.872 --> 01:32:19.449
Now I understand that
because I'm a biker, like,

01:32:19.450 --> 01:32:21.994
and that's the last thing I'd want is
somebody to cut my leathers.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:24.248
But he was good. He was good.

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:27.833
Definitely somebody's up there
watching him.

01:32:27.834 --> 01:32:29.006
No doubt about it.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:30.962
Lucky guy.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:39.017
I thought,
"Right, job was looking good."

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:42.144
Job was looking good,
131 and a half from a standing start.

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.693
Uh, slowing to come into the pits,
I think 1306,

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.691
battling for the lead.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.530
Went out from the pits,
got about five mile out, at Glen Vine.

01:32:53.693 --> 01:32:54.865
Took the front.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.743
Thought I got it.
Thought I got it! Got it! Got it!

01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:59.870
See, I've had a few moments like this.

01:32:59.871 --> 01:33:01.999
You're just riding into
the grip that you've got.

01:33:02.577 --> 01:33:06.172
And I was riding up to that point of

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.833
I knew where there was decent grip,

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.584
and you couldn't really push
past that point.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:13.008
Cos I just left the pits with
another full tank of petrol,

01:33:13.009 --> 01:33:16.058
and I decided in my head
the grip that I could ride up to

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:17.349
and, um...

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:20.891
Obviously not.

01:33:20.892 --> 01:33:23.645
I think the full tank of petrol
probably made a bit of difference.

01:33:23.723 --> 01:33:27.273
Uh, lost the front. Far fronner.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:31.944
You know, one of the faster corners
of the track.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:34.025
Probably 160-70 mile an hour.

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.547
And took the front, I thought

01:33:35.548 --> 01:33:37.534
"I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

01:33:37.535 --> 01:33:39.708
"No... No, I ain't got it."

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:41.374
So I had to jump ship.

01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:43.924
And I think I ended up with a few...

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:47.042
I've got a few bits of
singed eyebrows and eyelashes,

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:49.375
and singed me fringe and what have you.

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.459
But it's... I ended up
in the wall I think.

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:53.090
I can't remember much.
I was knocked out.

01:33:53.091 --> 01:33:54.134
But I'm still here.

01:33:54.135 --> 01:33:56.779
And I'm not bad, really. It could have
been a lot worse, couldn't it?

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.407
Could have been a lot worse.

01:33:58.408 --> 01:33:59.580
Yeah, I think it is nothing.

01:33:59.582 --> 01:34:02.756
It's only, you know, a bit of bark
off my knees and what have you,

01:34:02.757 --> 01:34:04.699
you know, when you're sliding at
160-70 mile an hour

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.047
that's a lot of heat, isn't it?

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:08.230
I've got a lot of
friction burns from sliding.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.687
A few broken ribs, a punctured lung.

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:16.322
Uh, four chipped vertebrae
and two cracked vertebrae.

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:18.153
Apart from that, I'm like a new one.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:23.413
So, yeah, just sat here and... Yeah.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:26.335
I think... I think here,

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:29.085
I'm sat here moving my legs
and I think, "Ah, I'm invincible."

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.633
Then I try and get off
and I think, "Oh, fucking hell."

01:34:31.634 --> 01:34:33.728
I'm not as good as I think.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.587
Cos they say like owt with the spine,
you can't rush it, can you?

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:38.932
Now, it's a stable fracture
as it is at the moment,

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.806
but push any harder,
you know, and it can...

01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:45.107
Like Conor's just up the corridor there,
not looking clever.

01:34:45.108 --> 01:34:48.954
His back's a bit worse than mine,
and they're having to send him away

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.987
to get his shoulder
and his elbow screwed together.

01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:54.693
But it's part of the game, boy.

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:56.866
We all know the risks.
No one's making us do owt.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:59.118
All part of the game.

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:03.539
Put me in that position again
and I'll do exactly the same.

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:05.291
Exactly the same again.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:08.874
I’ll be back.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.464
He's just making me work for it,
isn't he?

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:14.834
Sorted.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:25.012
I think I've had a podium
every year since 1997.

01:35:25.013 --> 01:35:27.812
So, it seems weird, you know,
coming up on the access road

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:31.143
and, you know, not getting
a cheer and a clap

01:35:31.144 --> 01:35:34.819
and getting waved past the rostrum
and I was leading the first race

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:37.494
and it all went wrong and then
in the senior, the blue ribbon race,

01:35:37.495 --> 01:35:40.373
I got up to a sort of eleven second lead
and then Guy had the crash.

01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:43.162
You know, the red flags come out
and you've got to come back

01:35:43.238 --> 01:35:44.535
and tune yourself back in,

01:35:44.536 --> 01:35:46.073
and get dialled in and ready
for the restart

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:47.741
and the restart looking like
it was going good

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.541
and then we had a kill switch failure.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.839
Two pence wire snaps off
and the solder breaks

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:55.918
and just puts you
out of contention completely.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.836
You know, that's
the TT for you, I suppose.

01:35:57.837 --> 01:36:00.841
I've had a lot of luck in the past,
I've won a lot of races round here.

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:03.690
And when luck's not on your side,
it's not happening for you.

01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:05.676
For sure Guy Martin's had
a worse day than I had,

01:36:05.677 --> 01:36:08.897
and for sure Conor Cummins has had
a lot worse day than I have.

01:36:08.972 --> 01:36:12.852
I'm still in one piece. I'm gonna
head for the ferry and get home

01:36:12.853 --> 01:36:15.527
and get my thoughts together
and see what's going to be available

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:18.857
for next year, or,
if nothing floats me boat,

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.033
I might hang me leathers up.
You never know.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.742
Me and the kids, together;
have had our down times

01:36:29.742 --> 01:36:32.211
and I haven't tried to
hide anything from them.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:34.790
You know, we've done
our crying together

01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:38.759
And then, "OK, what are we
gonna do now?"

01:36:39.585 --> 01:36:41.212
Get over it, move on.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.966
I think the point of life
is to enjoy it.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:47.222
Have as good a time as we can while
we're here and what we've got given.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.391
You can't change what you get given

01:36:49.392 --> 01:36:51.394
but you can decide
whether or not to enjoy it.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.989
I've been to look at
where the crash was,

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:05.161
there's still bits of green paint from
either the bike or me leathers

01:37:05.162 --> 01:37:07.070
still on the cat's eye
on the side of the road.

01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:10.120
I can actually see
where it's all gone wrong.

01:37:10.121 --> 01:37:11.964
I've disappeared over the side.

01:37:11.965 --> 01:37:14.935
And the way I look at it that's where
the injuries started to happen

01:37:14.936 --> 01:37:18.190
and it sort of..
It does get to you a little bit.

01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:20.510
The main one was me back.

01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.337
I broke that in five places

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.514
and I've got a big scar on my back

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:29.015
as a result of getting tumbled down
the hill and hitting a few things,

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:31.141
I broke my arm in four places.

01:37:31.142 --> 01:37:34.362
Some slight nerve damage to it
but that's coming back nicely.

01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:37.857
My knee was dislocated, a few scrapes,

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:42.281
I had a fractured pelvis
and a fractured shoulder blade

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:43.779
and a bruised lung, as well.

01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:48.034
Um, there was a bit
to take in really, you know.

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:53.122
To get my head around it
was a big challenge, you know, mentally.

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:55.620
There's no chance I'm giving up.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:38:00.550
I'm 24 year old and I perfectly accept
I've been really really lucky

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:04.220
but me love for bike racing
is still there

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:05.968
and I've got goals I want to achieve.

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:09.221
So the first opportunity I ever get
I'll be straight on it.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.177
That's my plan, you know.

01:38:11.177 --> 01:38:14.147
Come up to the Veranda
next TT or whenever I get back,

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:17.684
and just attack it like normal.

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:22.818
Yeah, it was a big one but
we'll just get on with life.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.649
The world ain't gonna stop for me.

01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:28.035
Tremendous start,
round the outside.

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:29.363
We think Ian Hutchinson,

01:38:29.445 --> 01:38:32.870
the five times in a week
winner of the TT

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:35.327
may be the lad who's down there.

01:38:35.328 --> 01:38:39.504
Unfortunately, yeah, I got into
the second to last race of the year

01:38:39.505 --> 01:38:43.726
on a short circuit, not a road race,
and ended up with this injury.

01:38:44.627 --> 01:38:48.427
I mean, it's a shame how it happened.
To be ridden off by somebody else.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:53.178
You know, when it happened and they were
talking about amputating my leg,

01:38:53.179 --> 01:38:56.433
there was only one reason
I didn’t want to amputate

01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:58.937
and that's so I can race
a motorbike, you know.

01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:02.028
Apart from that,
nothing else really matters, so,

01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:05.361
you know, my argument
was to get my foot back on.

01:39:05.362 --> 01:39:07.535
And not only get it on,

01:39:07.536 --> 01:39:11.211
I said, "I don't want a foot
just on the end of my leg.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:14.783
"I want a foot that's 100% working
so I can get on with my job."

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.285
Couldn't have been a better time
for it to happen, obviously,

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:21.130
seven months until
the start of the season, so...

01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:25.051
I've just got to get on with it
and get back to fitness

01:39:25.052 --> 01:39:26.895
for the start of next year.

01:39:27.305 --> 01:39:33.353
