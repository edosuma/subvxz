00:44.286 --> 00:45.959
When my father passed

00:47.932 --> 00:50.278
I wanted nothing more
than my mother's happiness.

00:55.412 --> 00:58.505
For what kind of man would I be
if I did not help my mother.

01:00.848 --> 01:02.382
If I did not save her.

01:05.623 --> 01:07.790
MONTANA, 1925

01:53.267 --> 01:55.410
-You've not eaten?
-No.

02:11.607 --> 02:14.002
Have you figured it out yet, Fatso?

02:14.975 --> 02:16.014
What?

02:17.842 --> 02:22.131
How many years since we took over
the ranch from the Old Gent and Old Lady?

02:23.808 --> 02:24.901
Why?

02:25.912 --> 02:27.662
Oh, hell. Think about it.

02:33.461 --> 02:35.781
Have you ever tried
the house bathroom?

02:38.787 --> 02:40.234
No, I have not.

02:42.936 --> 02:45.944
Early off tomorrow, brother,
think I'll drive.

03:20.313 --> 03:22.408
There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.033
-What happened?
-Anthrax. Don't touch.

03:30.171 --> 03:31.378
Well…

03:32.735 --> 03:34.089
Guess this is it.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.476
What's "it", Phil?

03:38.062 --> 03:39.188
What's "it"?

03:39.534 --> 03:41.761
All right, Fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.

03:43.325 --> 03:45.895
Twenty five years
since our first run together.

03:47.486 --> 03:49.293
Nineteen hundred and nothing.

03:49.903 --> 03:51.283
That's a long time.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.884
But not too damn long.

04:03.181 --> 04:04.597
Do you know what we should do?

04:04.804 --> 04:05.827
What's that?

04:06.327 --> 04:07.816
Go camping again in the mountains

04:07.904 --> 04:10.068
and shoot ourselves
some fresh elk liver.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.079
Cook it right there on the coals.

04:12.679 --> 04:14.404
Like Bronco Henry taught us.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.237
You got a sore gut?

04:21.418 --> 04:22.442
No.

04:22.811 --> 04:25.731
You act like it pains you to
hear those two words together.

04:28.604 --> 04:30.175
Which way do we lead them?

04:30.982 --> 04:32.102
We're going right.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.295
Got it.

04:35.488 --> 04:36.503
Hang on to it.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.261
There'll be 12 for tonight.

05:23.855 --> 05:25.642
Do you know what they prefer to eat?

05:25.938 --> 05:28.001
They like the fried chicken dinner.

05:37.876 --> 05:38.804
Yes?

05:38.888 --> 05:40.282
I'm going to need your room.

05:40.575 --> 05:41.595
All right.

05:47.616 --> 05:48.796
What are you doing?

05:49.394 --> 05:50.480
Nothing.

05:54.439 --> 05:55.732
Is that an album?

05:57.156 --> 05:58.202
Not really.

05:58.365 --> 05:59.865
-May I?
-Sure.

06:03.634 --> 06:04.894
Do you like the mansion?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.510
Too much to clean.

06:07.010 --> 06:08.450
You wouldn't have to clean it.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.745
There'll be cleaners.

06:14.003 --> 06:15.292
Oh, she's beautiful.

06:16.726 --> 06:18.157
I like her flowers.

06:19.987 --> 06:22.674
Oh, that's clever, Peter.

06:25.436 --> 06:26.850
They are so lovely.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.295
Thanks.

06:30.178 --> 06:31.344
For the tables?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.516
Sure.

06:36.247 --> 06:38.098
I need three chickens.
Can you do them?

06:38.218 --> 06:39.254
All right.

06:41.252 --> 06:43.285
You gonna have to move
your stuff to the shed.

06:43.587 --> 06:45.388
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.884
BELOVED HUSBAND AND FATHER
TO ROSE AND PETER

07:06.233 --> 07:08.207
DR JOHN GORDON, 1880-1921

07:35.066 --> 07:36.570
Hey, which way?

08:04.419 --> 08:05.426
Ladies.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.566
Thank you.

08:21.970 --> 08:23.638
-Is he there?
-Nope.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.867
Well, we can't wait forever.
Cattle are in the yards so drink up.

08:31.741 --> 08:33.861
-You gonna say something?
-Nope.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.433
Not without my brother.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.449
Where were you?

08:46.697 --> 08:49.025
Look, I can't make the boys
hold back forever.

08:49.181 --> 08:50.414
That's fine.

08:53.136 --> 08:56.869
I checked the power, and it's held up,
not coming till the morning.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.322
Oh no, thanks.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.796
Phil, they're ready for us
next door at the Red Mill.

09:01.943 --> 09:03.576
Dinner time, boys.

09:04.486 --> 09:05.869
Let's get a move on.

09:09.645 --> 09:14.035
Twenty five years ago,
where were you, Georgie boy, hm?

09:15.485 --> 09:17.191
-What to you?
-I'll tell you.

09:18.021 --> 09:21.621
Chubby know-nothing,
too dumb to get through college.

09:22.279 --> 09:25.568
People helped you, Fatso.
One person in particular.

09:25.722 --> 09:28.904
Taught you and me ranching
so we damn well succeeded.

09:34.885 --> 09:36.209
Bronco Henry.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.822
So…

09:42.795 --> 09:45.357
So to us, brothers, Romulus and Remus,

09:46.014 --> 09:47.347
and the wolf who raised us.

09:47.484 --> 09:48.937
-To Bronco Henry.
-To Bronco.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.088
-<i>Al lupo</i>.
-To Bronco.

09:50.171 --> 09:51.315
-To Bronco Henry.
<i>-Al lupo</i> ?

09:51.457 --> 09:52.550
To Bronco Henry.

09:57.632 --> 09:58.711
Boss is leaving.

09:58.837 --> 09:59.858
Dinner, boys.

10:08.859 --> 10:09.999
Much obliged.

10:16.002 --> 10:18.882
Rose, Rose, would you play
piano for us, please?

10:19.021 --> 10:20.134
I can't.

10:20.242 --> 10:22.561
Come on, Rose. Play! Play!

10:28.640 --> 10:30.100
Is everything all right?

10:30.220 --> 10:31.560
Yes, ma'am, fine.

10:47.836 --> 10:49.750
Well. Well…

10:51.538 --> 10:53.296
Ain't them pretty?

11:25.908 --> 11:28.558
Oh, yeah… Well…

11:30.006 --> 11:33.846
I wonder what little lady made these?

11:36.891 --> 11:38.437
Actually, I did, sir.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.260
My mother was a florist,

11:44.068 --> 11:46.284
so I made them to look like
the ones in our garden.

11:46.905 --> 11:48.455
Oh, well, do pardon me.

11:51.136 --> 11:55.682
They're just as real as possible.

12:02.727 --> 12:06.312
Ah, now, gentlemen, look, see,
that's what you do with the cloth.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.672
-Oh.
-Wow.

12:09.836 --> 12:10.766
Right.

12:13.154 --> 12:16.430
-That's really just for wine drips.
-Oh, you got that, boys?

12:16.757 --> 12:18.597
Only for the drip.

12:24.164 --> 12:25.597
Now get us some food.

12:50.752 --> 12:52.159
Did Bronco ever eat here?

12:52.571 --> 12:53.864
No, he did not.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.791
So where did you eat?

12:56.916 --> 12:59.297
Oh, back then we had
herring at the saloon,

12:59.380 --> 13:01.212
and whole lot of alcohol.

13:03.643 --> 13:06.078
I remember this one time
Bronco made this wager

13:06.167 --> 13:07.738
that he could jump any horse,

13:07.821 --> 13:11.542
over the tables and chairs
at the saloon piled up in the street…

13:12.922 --> 13:16.745
Well… we chose him a nag, all right.

13:17.883 --> 13:19.183
Didn't bother him.

13:20.347 --> 13:21.801
He took off his saddle.

13:22.986 --> 13:26.962
Walked the horse up to the tables
and chairs talking to him all the while,

13:27.149 --> 13:30.117
stroking his big ugly head
while the horse sniffing…

13:33.053 --> 13:34.807
And then he swung on

13:36.552 --> 13:39.005
and rode him back and…

13:42.477 --> 13:43.492
What?

13:47.366 --> 13:48.459
Flew over.

13:49.022 --> 13:50.087
He jumped it?

13:57.056 --> 13:58.696
But to get a nag to jump,

13:59.352 --> 14:00.437
ain't heard of.

14:01.835 --> 14:03.825
Put it down to <i>amore</i>.

14:07.086 --> 14:08.533
What do you say, George?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.200
<i>Amore?</i>

14:16.272 --> 14:18.292
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:30.943 --> 14:33.286
Do you mind quietening? We're reading.

14:35.996 --> 14:38.388
Shut that down or I will!

15:11.168 --> 15:12.496
Are you all right, Peter?

15:18.983 --> 15:20.576
Where are you going?

15:43.917 --> 15:44.893
Let's go.

15:46.384 --> 15:47.527
Let's go.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.044
Go on over, I'll settle up.

15:55.599 --> 15:57.002
Settle in the morning.

15:58.016 --> 15:59.219
I won't be long.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.237
Shall I settle up now, Mrs. Gordon or…

17:54.765 --> 17:56.285
Please, you can…

17:57.904 --> 18:00.122
send the bill, I'll post a cheque.

18:32.742 --> 18:34.075
I said I love you.

18:34.772 --> 18:36.118
I love you.

18:38.064 --> 18:39.001
I love you too.

19:00.941 --> 19:02.475
8, 1925

19:02.628 --> 19:08.587
PHIL BURBANK

19:19.375 --> 19:20.555
George?

19:46.748 --> 19:48.502
IN CASE OF FIRE

20:21.186 --> 20:22.253
George?

20:50.932 --> 20:52.032
Where have you been?

20:56.461 --> 20:59.594
What she said about
her boy tonight, Phil…

21:01.927 --> 21:03.340
made her cry.

21:07.862 --> 21:09.888
She had an ear to the door?

21:12.935 --> 21:14.375
She was crying, Phil.

21:15.734 --> 21:16.984
What the hell?

21:18.490 --> 21:22.115
I said her boy needed to
snap out of it and get humane.

21:25.997 --> 21:27.491
Pointed it out, that's all.

21:30.529 --> 21:31.883
She should damn well know.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.224
Hold it.

22:08.151 --> 22:09.057
Come on.

22:10.908 --> 22:12.128
He's got it.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.712
He was better before.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.561
He's getting there.

22:19.036 --> 22:20.770
Is that how Bronco Henry learnt it?

22:22.601 --> 22:24.947
Never saw him out
on the lounge, that's the fact.

22:38.977 --> 22:40.817
What is it you see out there, Phil?

22:42.214 --> 22:43.414
Are animals out there?

22:44.444 --> 22:46.543
Has anyone else seen
what you've seen, Phil?

22:48.822 --> 22:49.907
George?

22:54.765 --> 22:55.806
Nah, not him.

22:59.322 --> 23:00.842
Come on Phil, what is it?

23:02.545 --> 23:04.111
There is something there, right?

23:05.498 --> 23:07.318
Not if you can't see it, there ain't.

23:11.438 --> 23:12.516
Gotta be an animal.

23:37.846 --> 23:39.717
RESTAURANT BED & DINING
MONTANA.

24:03.418 --> 24:04.838
Hello, Mr. Burbank.

24:05.448 --> 24:06.628
Hello, Mrs. Gordon.

24:07.692 --> 24:08.801
How can I help you?

24:12.038 --> 24:15.232
I really just came to see you.

24:20.013 --> 24:21.173
I'm quite busy.

24:38.256 --> 24:41.433
"This most wholesome sauce is excellent

24:42.526 --> 24:45.576
with meats, fish and cheese."

24:49.870 --> 24:51.300
They have wine with them.

24:51.965 --> 24:53.312
I wish the wouldn't do that.

24:53.550 --> 24:55.193
I don't like drinking.

24:56.047 --> 24:59.107
I'd say they have more in them
than wine, sounds like booze.

24:59.816 --> 25:00.883
They're early.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.045
Should have never put the
pianolo in there.

25:14.354 --> 25:15.815
Here's the water.

25:22.943 --> 25:27.335
I see the Herndon Doctor
and the undertaker, Mr. Wells.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.801
Goodness, I wish Peter was here.

25:30.557 --> 25:32.377
He should be serving the salad and…

25:32.927 --> 25:34.641
I need to fry the chicken.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.873
Sometime if you get
food on the table…

25:39.333 --> 25:41.013
Um, Mr. Burbank,

25:41.787 --> 25:43.494
I'm gonna run and get Peter.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.213
Good afternoon.

26:00.288 --> 26:01.991
Looks like I'm the new waiter.

26:03.947 --> 26:05.126
The Doctor.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.110
Mr. Burbank.

26:08.651 --> 26:09.684
Mr. Wells.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.718
I didn't know any snow down below.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.347
None to speak of.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.561
Well, I guess I'll roll me
a smoke since I'm woke up.

27:18.994 --> 27:20.320
How far did you get?

27:21.964 --> 27:25.352
Beach, that's where I aimed for.

27:26.487 --> 27:27.463
Beach?

27:29.086 --> 27:31.446
What were you doing
down there, Georgie boy?

27:32.591 --> 27:34.038
Little tomcatting?

27:38.968 --> 27:40.962
I was speaking to Mrs Gordon.

27:45.717 --> 27:47.197
Oh, yes.

27:48.339 --> 27:50.199
She cried on your shoulder.

27:52.624 --> 27:53.704
So she did.

27:55.803 --> 28:00.299
Give her half a chance and she'll be after
some dollar for Ms. Nancy's college fee.

28:09.192 --> 28:12.118
Remember how the Old Lady
brought those girls out to the ranch

28:12.222 --> 28:14.292
as soon as we could get hard-ons?

28:15.749 --> 28:16.782
Oh, my God.

28:18.608 --> 28:21.061
Remember the tomato soup queen?

28:26.124 --> 28:28.458
Wasn't it her that wrote to you,

28:29.214 --> 28:32.062
"I always will remember the western moon."

28:36.624 --> 28:39.364
Well, I guess you could've taken her out

28:39.491 --> 28:42.318
without first putting
a sack over her head.

28:43.225 --> 28:44.718
Unlike some others.

28:58.566 --> 29:00.146
Well, night, Phil.

29:10.938 --> 29:12.917
If it's a piece of ass you're after, Fatso

29:13.057 --> 29:15.470
I'm damn sure you can get it
without a license.

29:25.659 --> 29:26.659
Hold it.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.570
What do you do with these?

29:52.783 --> 29:53.790
Goddamn.

29:54.873 --> 29:56.339
Do you cut them up or something?

30:10.090 --> 30:11.840
<i>George has</i>

30:12.185 --> 30:13.380
He's gone again.

30:14.285 --> 30:15.894
<i>got himself</i>

30:18.098 --> 30:19.200
<i>tangled</i>

Little desk to your big desk.

30:58.352 --> 30:59.960
-Phil?
-Yeah.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.629
Got your old timer.

31:03.140 --> 31:06.600
Did you write to the Old Lady?

31:08.960 --> 31:10.585
Yeah, I dropped them both a line.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.731
Did you say something about Rose?

31:16.295 --> 31:17.763
Yeah, Rose. Well,

31:18.311 --> 31:22.226
You know as well as I do
what the Old Lady would feel

31:23.037 --> 31:24.529
if she heard you were

31:25.025 --> 31:26.818
getting mixed up with her.

31:29.776 --> 31:31.714
She'd like the other hemorrhage.

31:32.615 --> 31:35.673
The Old Lady would feel as

31:36.393 --> 31:38.727
one Mrs. Burbank would feel

31:39.839 --> 31:41.339
for another Mrs. Burbank.

31:42.644 --> 31:43.886
Come again.

31:45.975 --> 31:47.295
We were married Sunday.

31:49.755 --> 31:52.012
She got rid of her property in beach.

32:18.625 --> 32:19.991
Stay steady, you little bitch.

32:23.507 --> 32:24.851
You little bitch.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.015
You flat-faced bitch!

32:33.616 --> 32:34.741
Whore.

32:41.749 --> 32:44.890
My school boarders
eat dinner at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

32:45.007 --> 32:47.420
No dish washing duty
if he has homework.

32:48.439 --> 32:50.659
Oh, no shoes inside.

32:55.993 --> 32:58.337
Maybe you'd like to come
to the ranch sometimes.

32:58.670 --> 33:00.376
Won't that be nice?

33:00.517 --> 33:02.485
May I keep some of these rose petals?

33:16.954 --> 33:18.337
Take the rest of them later.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.209
I've been thinking
we should have

33:38.292 --> 33:42.127
some sort of dinner party to
introduce you to my parents.

33:44.585 --> 33:49.389
And perhaps we could invite
the governor and his wife too,

33:50.075 --> 33:51.928
I saw them in Herndon today.

33:52.085 --> 33:56.694
And, uh, I kind of already
mentioned it to them.

33:58.631 --> 34:04.272
Um, maybe you'd be kind enough to
play something on our old piano.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.916
But George, I'm not very good.

34:08.719 --> 34:11.018
I only played for the moving pictures.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.806
You are plenty fine enough for us.

34:17.897 --> 34:20.451
The Old Lady can't play a note. So…

34:21.829 --> 34:23.001
If that's what you want.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.063
This looks like a good spot.

34:29.572 --> 34:31.025
Pull over here, please.

34:31.431 --> 34:32.891
Good spot for what?

34:56.735 --> 34:58.326
You are marvelous, Rose.

35:09.665 --> 35:11.248
Stand beside me, George.

35:15.725 --> 35:16.904
What's happening?

35:17.375 --> 35:18.451
Follow me.

35:19.715 --> 35:20.912
Left foot forward.

35:21.575 --> 35:24.944
One, two, three, into the side,

35:25.438 --> 35:28.656
One, two, three and back.

35:28.876 --> 35:32.360
One, two, three,

35:33.338 --> 35:36.432
-to the side again. One, two…
-Sorry, I really can't.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.290
I really can't dance.

35:40.445 --> 35:41.899
You're dancing.

35:43.001 --> 35:44.626
Here, let's look forward.

35:47.259 --> 35:48.235
Don't think.

35:50.044 --> 35:54.707
One, two, three, to the side.
One, two, three and back.

35:54.872 --> 35:56.809
One, two, three.

35:57.012 --> 35:58.677
Told you, I'd teach you.

36:07.325 --> 36:09.637
One, two, three,

36:10.067 --> 36:11.833
side, to hmm.

36:27.679 --> 36:28.929
What is it, George?

36:35.842 --> 36:37.279
Oh, I just

36:39.795 --> 36:42.138
wanted to say how nice it is

36:43.775 --> 36:45.110
not to be alone.

37:31.934 --> 37:34.411
Go on up and get out of the cold.

37:54.297 --> 37:55.389
Hello, Phil.

37:56.570 --> 37:58.022
You remember Rose?

37:58.850 --> 38:00.183
Oh, hello there.

38:00.396 --> 38:01.530
Hello.

38:02.249 --> 38:03.702
Something wrong with the furnace?

38:04.130 --> 38:05.210
Search me.

38:08.309 --> 38:09.980
I'll go down and shake it up.

38:10.063 --> 38:11.653
I've been hanging around for you all day

38:11.736 --> 38:14.329
there's a deed the Old Gent
wants sent to him.

38:15.985 --> 38:18.439
I figure that can go till morning.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.351
-You all right?
-I'm perfectly fine, George.

38:39.514 --> 38:41.683
Well, brother Phil,

38:42.770 --> 38:45.864
-we had such a nice trip.
-I'm not your brother.

38:46.475 --> 38:47.949
You're a cheap schemer.

39:07.439 --> 39:09.151
♪ We had such a nice trip ♪

39:42.512 --> 39:44.002
Come on it.

39:47.642 --> 39:49.455
This is the bathroom.

39:50.181 --> 39:51.924
Just make yourself at home.

39:56.343 --> 39:57.502
Is that yours?

39:57.585 --> 39:58.788
Yeah, it's mine.

IN LOVING MEMORY BRONCO HENRY FRIEND

43:31.640 --> 43:34.452
So you just make yourself comfortable.

43:37.250 --> 43:39.732
Now, I'm going to
bring you a surprise.

43:40.550 --> 43:41.596
What is it?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.912
Well, then it won't be a surprise.

44:05.780 --> 44:07.227
<i>The cellar gets flooded</i>

44:07.310 --> 44:12.239

Please keep talking.

44:29.990 --> 44:31.022
Don't mind me.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.334
I like to keep busy.

44:48.272 --> 44:49.193
Easy.

44:50.840 --> 44:51.750
We got it.

44:51.969 --> 44:53.264
Turn to the right.

44:57.100 --> 44:58.631
Turn it around that way.

44:58.788 --> 44:59.663
Oh, thank you.

44:59.935 --> 45:00.999
You should have this.

45:01.983 --> 45:04.100

Is that a grand?

45:09.119 --> 45:10.932

-Yeah, I got it.</i>

45:11.385 --> 45:12.552

The Mason & Hamlin, baby grand.

I don't know, it's
too good for me,

45:18.024 --> 45:20.755
I'm just very average.

45:20.838 --> 45:22.095
I only know tunes.

45:22.895 --> 45:24.879
That's what I want, the tunes.

45:25.121 --> 45:26.450
The governor too.

45:27.155 --> 45:28.452
We don't want concert.

45:28.535 --> 45:30.215
We just want to hear you play, Rose.

45:31.415 --> 45:32.828

These stripes? Yeah.

49:27.980 --> 49:30.165
You boys find something needs doing.

49:30.905 --> 49:32.777
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

49:33.046 --> 49:34.171
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

49:43.955 --> 49:47.268
I just came over to
speak about something.

49:57.035 --> 49:59.550
Come on, partner. Open to talker.
What is it?

50:04.250 --> 50:07.077
His nibs will be here for dinner,

50:07.289 --> 50:10.518
and the Old Gent
and the Old Lady.

50:12.050 --> 50:14.420
Well sir, ain't we going
in the society.

50:19.276 --> 50:21.330
She's on the panano again,

50:22.659 --> 50:24.354
setting your teeth on edge?

50:27.020 --> 50:28.183
No.

50:29.945 --> 50:31.924
No. I like to hear Rose play.

50:40.604 --> 50:43.289
Well, tell me what is it?
What's in the noodle?

50:45.945 --> 50:47.057
Well,

50:48.315 --> 50:49.424
Phil,

50:50.198 --> 50:51.432
I, uh,

50:54.475 --> 50:56.571
-I just…
-Go on and spit it out.

50:56.654 --> 50:59.939
Well, it's about his nibs, the governor.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.236
All right.

51:01.489 --> 51:02.714
And, uh,

51:03.911 --> 51:07.042
well, it's not so much about his nibs,

51:07.543 --> 51:10.137
but his nib's wife

51:10.320 --> 51:12.293
actually, uh,

51:14.239 --> 51:18.942
I was thinking his nibs probably
wouldn't mind so much, but

51:20.253 --> 51:21.776
his missus,

51:22.395 --> 51:25.184
-might…
-What for dear Christ sake?

51:26.180 --> 51:28.512
Well, it's sort of a hard thing

51:31.068 --> 51:33.131
to say. Uh,

51:37.250 --> 51:40.867
she might mind if you come to the table
without a wash up.

51:46.490 --> 51:47.492
Yeah.

52:08.381 --> 52:10.258
Hello, Mother, Father.

52:10.829 --> 52:11.760
Hello.

52:15.383 --> 52:16.828
Car's around the side.

52:17.225 --> 52:18.601
Is there anyone with you?

52:19.616 --> 52:20.810
My wife.

52:28.107 --> 52:31.482
So the napkin is pinned.

52:32.915 --> 52:34.032
So…

52:36.821 --> 52:38.164
Light the fire.

52:38.282 --> 52:39.579
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

52:40.062 --> 52:41.921
At least we'll try and
warm this place.

52:47.862 --> 52:49.992
Use your hand. Use your hand.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.242
They are here.

53:04.109 --> 53:05.062
You keep normal.

53:05.374 --> 53:06.984
I can bring them in.

53:32.141 --> 53:35.467
Oh how sweet, they have
their own umbrella.

53:35.550 --> 53:36.570
Orange blossoms.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.676
It's an island of civilization here.

53:39.990 --> 53:42.989
I was, uh, telling Georgie about
your brother

53:43.543 --> 53:45.739
Phi beta Kappa at Yale.
Wasn't it?

53:46.110 --> 53:48.301
Yes. And classics.

53:48.953 --> 53:50.075
That's right.

53:51.090 --> 53:55.020
So, uh, he swears that the cattle
in Greek or in Latin.

54:05.018 --> 54:09.955
Rose plays the piano very well.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.287
Do you?

54:12.110 --> 54:13.525
That's a nice surprise.

54:22.610 --> 54:26.578
I'll just go have a look.
See out the back for Phil.

54:26.870 --> 54:29.258
Oh, good.
I want to meet this brother.

54:29.815 --> 54:30.877
Yes.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.200
Ah, here are two people
we can't fool.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.684
Oh, no, you cannot.

54:40.840 --> 54:43.197
We know everything,
we're walking encyclopedias.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.320
At least I am. I have
nothing to do but read.

54:45.420 --> 54:48.300
She have been reading the "Curse
of Tutankhamun" in the digest.

54:48.383 --> 54:49.428
So, uh,

54:49.771 --> 54:50.847
you believe in the curse?

54:50.930 --> 54:53.771
Oh no, no.
I'm not drinking, George's concoction.

54:53.889 --> 54:54.904
Yes I do.

54:54.987 --> 54:59.106
But did you know the Tutankhamun
was just a boy, only 18?

55:11.105 --> 55:12.633
Phil, are you here?

55:22.085 --> 55:23.678
I was looking for you.

55:26.467 --> 55:28.138
Well, you found me.

55:29.885 --> 55:31.051
Everyone's here.

55:31.134 --> 55:32.482
And we're just about to eat.

55:33.845 --> 55:35.826
They were asking after you.

55:37.625 --> 55:38.521
Really?

55:39.455 --> 55:42.646
Yes, we were counting
on your conversation.

55:48.185 --> 55:51.261
I shouldn't have said what I
said to you about…

55:51.344 --> 55:53.652
You two can keep your
apologies to yourself.

55:53.735 --> 55:54.919
I'm not coming.

55:56.765 --> 55:58.348
And what will I say?

55:59.795 --> 56:01.639
The Old Lady wants to see you too.

56:01.722 --> 56:02.904
She's come a long way.

56:02.993 --> 56:04.718
You tell them the truth

56:05.391 --> 56:06.733
that I stink.

56:07.384 --> 56:08.435
And I like it.

56:11.465 --> 56:13.482
Nothing could have happened
to Phil, could it?

56:13.565 --> 56:15.175
No, he'll be fine.

56:15.785 --> 56:17.793
Something just must've come up.

56:20.134 --> 56:21.462
So, Rose,

56:23.795 --> 56:25.152
are you going to play for us?

56:25.235 --> 56:27.395
Yes. George told me
you play very well.

56:27.905 --> 56:29.131
-Oh no.
-Yes.

56:29.248 --> 56:31.115
I'm terribly out of practice.

56:31.514 --> 56:33.724
Now, you've been playing a lot.

56:34.227 --> 56:37.797
-You know you have.
-I don't know what to play.

56:39.905 --> 56:41.351
Play the one I like.

56:43.039 --> 56:45.122
-What one?
-Why, the…

56:45.219 --> 56:47.112
The one about the gypsy?

56:47.195 --> 56:49.249
I can't seem to remember that one.

56:54.245 --> 56:55.796
Play anything.

57:47.195 --> 57:48.351
I'm so sorry.

57:49.805 --> 57:51.304
I can't seem to play.

57:52.715 --> 57:56.712
I-- I played in the cinema
pit for hours and hours.

57:56.795 --> 57:59.183
I'm so sorry.

58:00.698 --> 58:03.807
Well, she got you halter trained
right, George? That's the main thing.

58:04.558 --> 58:05.483
I'm so sorry.

58:05.566 --> 58:08.095
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.

58:08.178 --> 58:09.146
Thank you.

58:19.405 --> 58:21.443
Oh, you're Phil.

58:22.475 --> 58:24.648
So you weren't eaten by a cougar?

58:25.647 --> 58:26.709
Not yet.

58:27.125 --> 58:29.104
Well, I am sorry to have
missed your conversation.

58:29.365 --> 58:30.846
I've heard that you're brilliant.

58:30.929 --> 58:33.645
You're gonna want to keep your
distance and just stop the horse.

58:35.130 --> 58:36.935
Anyhow, you don't want conversation

58:37.018 --> 58:39.731
you've been listening to the panano
and dancing, I guess.

58:42.725 --> 58:43.794
You dance?

58:49.550 --> 58:51.489
You didn't play?

58:52.850 --> 58:55.372
Sure did practice a terrible lot.

58:57.529 --> 58:59.338
She wouldn't think
there's much difference

58:59.421 --> 59:01.833
between a cinema pit
and a dinner party.

59:02.029 --> 59:03.402
Where have you been, Phil?

59:04.903 --> 59:06.825
I could hardly eat.
Been worrying about you.

59:08.180 --> 59:10.589
I didn't get washed up
so I didn't come.

59:10.672 --> 59:11.974
You didn't wash?

59:15.094 --> 59:16.834
Oh, he's a ranch man.
Isn't that right?

59:17.070 --> 59:18.865
That's on his dirt.

59:21.875 --> 59:23.273
-Thank you again.
-Thank you.

01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:36.786
I wonder if he didn't think about leaving
your medical books here for the summer.

01:00:37.872 --> 01:00:39.856
I thought about it, but

01:00:41.192 --> 01:00:43.122
you understand they are dad's.

01:00:43.622 --> 01:00:44.770
Turn around.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.613
Are you eating?

01:00:51.819 --> 01:00:53.238
I made a new friend.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:56.006
He calls me doctor and
I call him professor because

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.488
that's what we wanna be.

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.856
Well, why don't you invite
your friend to the ranch?

01:01:01.234 --> 01:01:02.514
No, Rose.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:04.647
Why not?

01:01:05.492 --> 01:01:06.570
Thank you.

01:01:06.935 --> 01:01:09.106
I don't want him to meet a certain person.

01:01:15.169 --> 01:01:16.489
<i>Keep that leg touched down.</i>

01:01:16.692 --> 01:01:18.388
<i>-You got him?
-Here.</i>

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.763
<i>Grab his head.</i>

01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:23.356
<i>-I got it, I got it.
-Got it.</i>

01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:34.872
How come you don't wear gloves?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.426
I'm not cause they're not needed.

01:01:43.848 --> 01:01:46.754
Castrate 1500 heads then
make your turn on the last.

01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:53.051
About that, so,
I think we're finished.

01:02:01.274 --> 01:02:02.391
Is that…

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:06.790
Miss Nancy.

01:02:07.387 --> 01:02:08.394
Our waiter?

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:10.381
Yeah. That's him.

01:02:12.427 --> 01:02:15.325
You're gonna see him creeping
all over the place now.

01:02:15.762 --> 01:02:17.340
Big eyes, goggling.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.411
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:42.414
Rose?

01:02:44.624 --> 01:02:45.780
Did he like his room?

01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:47.417
Uh-huh.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:49.870
I think so.

01:02:51.459 --> 01:02:52.509
Watch your fires.

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:53.912
Summer's coming.

01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:58.249
Which also means any Indians camping
need to be moved off the property.

01:02:58.339 --> 01:02:59.401
No exceptions.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:03.030
We got animals
they want to eat, got it?

01:03:03.407 --> 01:03:04.610
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:06.391
We don't sell hides.

01:03:07.699 --> 01:03:09.500
We don't sell anything here.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.226
Keep your eyes and ears open.

01:03:31.749 --> 01:03:34.815
Maybe find yourselves no head up
by their masters.

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:18.563
Rose.

01:04:21.008 --> 01:04:22.438
I have a head-ache.

01:04:28.219 --> 01:04:29.539
Have a seat.

01:04:34.359 --> 01:04:36.047
I'm not eating tonight.

01:04:36.379 --> 01:04:39.349
It's George's week in town.

01:04:39.649 --> 01:04:41.761
So it's just Phil.

01:04:42.899 --> 01:04:44.039
Uh-hmm.

01:04:46.369 --> 01:04:47.563
I made a trap.

01:04:48.019 --> 01:04:50.804
Oh no, it's not a snake, is it?

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.359
Oh…

01:04:55.282 --> 01:04:56.751
It's a bunny.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.500
No. It's scared.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:10.406
-Get it, Peter.
-Come here.

01:05:14.227 --> 01:05:15.312
Bring him to me.

01:05:31.759 --> 01:05:33.141
Don't worry about him.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.602
They dug up that graveyard

01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:42.624
to make way for the new highway.

01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:46.180
Among those buried there
was a friend of mine,

01:05:46.586 --> 01:05:50.961
a clumsy tractor driver
broke open the coffin

01:05:51.554 --> 01:05:53.467
and they found her hair

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.734
had continued to grow
after her death.

01:05:58.324 --> 01:06:03.597
The whole coffin, just stuffed
with her lovely golden hair

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:07.182
except for a few feet from the end

01:06:08.081 --> 01:06:09.643
where it was gray.

01:06:13.714 --> 01:06:14.787
Can I take it up?

01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:16.967
-Some say she was a beauty.
-What?

01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:19.800
Golden braids
on top of her hair.

01:06:19.883 --> 01:06:22.106
Oh, yes, go and see.
It's very sweet.

01:06:29.341 --> 01:06:32.357
-No, please get out of my way.
-Where's your rabbit?

01:06:37.262 --> 01:06:38.338
I got it a carrot.

01:06:39.091 --> 01:06:40.640
Doesn't want one.

01:06:41.284 --> 01:06:42.385
Why?

01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:48.888
Holy hell.

01:06:57.817 --> 01:06:59.020
Shut the door.

01:07:11.848 --> 01:07:14.255
Even if you're happy being
in your room all day

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.145
it's good for me.

01:07:16.743 --> 01:07:18.443
-Mom, I have a lot to do.
-Come on.

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:20.865
Peter?

01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:24.388
I thought you liked rabbits.

01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:28.136
Yes. I do.

01:07:29.777 --> 01:07:32.066
But if I wanna be a surgeon
I have to practice.

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:37.767
Well, you're not to kill them
in the house, Peter.

01:07:38.268 --> 01:07:40.220
No, I'm putting my foot down.

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:44.829
What a man would be if he always did
what his mother told him.

01:07:45.142 --> 01:07:46.275
I'll score.

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.809
Point to Mrs. Burbank.

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:57.036
I know Lola.
You don't have to,

01:07:57.612 --> 01:07:58.857
you don't have to narrate it.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.080
I'll just remember.

01:08:07.669 --> 01:08:09.418
Yeah, that was definitely out.

01:08:24.919 --> 01:08:26.684
Lola, can you please take over?

01:08:27.198 --> 01:08:28.394
I have a migraine.

01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:30.032
Yeah.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:35.822
I was aiming for you.

01:08:36.776 --> 01:08:38.087
Are you all right, mother?

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:41.627
No, I feel like my eyes are
going to pop out of my head.

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.688
It's Phil. Isn't it?

01:08:55.117 --> 01:08:57.290
-He's cold.
-He's just a man, Peter.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.157
Only another man.

01:09:00.853 --> 01:09:02.142
You go ahead.

01:10:44.695 --> 01:10:45.946
You want more, do you?

01:10:48.937 --> 01:10:49.892
Yeah, come on.

01:10:49.976 --> 01:10:51.070
Yeah, you want him?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.101
-Yeah.
-You got him!

01:14:53.492 --> 01:14:55.790
PHYSICAL CULTURE 5

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:08.719
BRONCO HENRY

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.886
Get out of there, you little bitch!
You hear me?

01:16:24.019 --> 01:16:25.675
Get the hell out of here!

01:17:14.872 --> 01:17:15.972
Jesus.

01:17:22.937 --> 01:17:24.562
Whoa, whoa.

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:45.791
You wanna tell him
about so-called jeans?

01:17:51.276 --> 01:17:52.236
Howdy, Ma'am.

01:17:58.503 --> 01:17:59.526
Little faggot.

01:18:06.628 --> 01:18:07.769
Hey, Nancy.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.174
Hey.

01:18:38.329 --> 01:18:39.328
Hey, Pete.

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:42.604
Peter.

01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:49.341
You want me, Mr. Burbank?

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.910
I don't see any Mr. Burbank here.

01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:57.208
I'm Phil.

01:18:58.191 --> 01:18:59.297
Yes, Mr. Burbank.

01:18:59.381 --> 01:19:02.341
I guess it's hard for youngin like you
to call an old fella like me

01:19:02.425 --> 01:19:04.057
just plain Phil

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.925
at first.

01:19:07.878 --> 01:19:09.612
Now, come here and take a look at this.

01:19:11.339 --> 01:19:13.862
You've done any braiding
or plating yourself,

01:19:14.245 --> 01:19:15.307
Pete?

01:19:17.129 --> 01:19:19.816
No, I never have, sir.

01:19:24.599 --> 01:19:25.606
Peter.

01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:29.026
We kinda got off on the wrong foot.

01:19:30.406 --> 01:19:31.416
Did we, sir?

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:32.924
Forget the "sir" stuff.

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:35.959
That can happen to people.

01:19:37.289 --> 01:19:39.343
People who get to be good friends.

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:43.201
Well, you know what?

01:19:43.459 --> 01:19:45.375
What. "What", Phil?

01:19:48.349 --> 01:19:50.864
Yeah. You see?
You get it.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:52.924
Call me Phil.

01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:57.773
I'm going to finish this rope
and give it to you

01:19:57.856 --> 01:19:59.449
and teach you how to use it.

01:19:59.653 --> 01:20:03.122
Sort of a lonesome place
out here, Pete.

01:20:03.919 --> 01:20:06.027
Unless you get in the
swing of things.

01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:09.043
Thank you, Phil.

01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:13.801
How long do you expect it would take
to finish that rope?

01:20:14.119 --> 01:20:16.639
I could get it finished
before you go back to school.

01:20:20.569 --> 01:20:21.631
Well,

01:20:23.358 --> 01:20:24.748
won't be very long then, Phil.

01:21:31.624 --> 01:21:32.702
Get on it.

01:21:34.287 --> 01:21:35.784
You'd sit on it, Pete.

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:40.886
Get yourself used to it.

01:21:43.894 --> 01:21:45.237
You got any boots?

01:21:46.354 --> 01:21:48.151
-Yes.
-Then you should wear them.

01:21:50.703 --> 01:21:52.870
Don't let your mom
make a sissy out of you.

01:22:03.723 --> 01:22:05.097
That's impressive, Phil.

01:22:05.574 --> 01:22:06.425
Well,

01:22:07.795 --> 01:22:10.564
just by sitting there you're soaking up
all the riding know-how

01:22:10.653 --> 01:22:12.569
you'll ever need and then something.

01:22:13.314 --> 01:22:15.274
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.

01:22:16.876 --> 01:22:18.579
Greatest rider I ever knew.

01:22:26.163 --> 01:22:28.616
There's a cliff, way out
back at the ranch with

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.501
initials in 1805 carved into it.

01:22:32.584 --> 01:22:35.584
What must've been some fella from
Lewis and Clark expedition.

01:22:38.343 --> 01:22:40.397
They were real men in those days.

01:22:43.099 --> 01:22:45.614
Let's say, just you and me go out
for a couple of days,

01:22:45.964 --> 01:22:48.372
find those trails and
follow them to the end.

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:52.686
Won't be surprised if there were

01:22:53.108 --> 01:22:57.190
gold or precious minerals in them.
They're rocks.

01:23:01.449 --> 01:23:03.534
Do many of the calves
die from wolves?

01:23:06.739 --> 01:23:08.606
There's always a few who'd get

01:23:09.699 --> 01:23:14.058
tore up, or hamstrung, or die of Anthrax.
We call it Black leg.

01:23:14.417 --> 01:23:16.421
You know, you talk
like a big troll record,

01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:17.425
you know that?

01:23:17.548 --> 01:23:20.073
No, I didn't know.

01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:22.089
Yeah. But you do.

01:23:31.249 --> 01:23:33.315
Did Bronco Henry
teach you to ride, Phil?

01:23:33.679 --> 01:23:34.585
Yup.

01:23:37.219 --> 01:23:41.284
He taught me to use my eyes,
ways that other people can't.

01:23:44.056 --> 01:23:45.753
Take that hill over there.

01:23:51.529 --> 01:23:53.880
Most people look at it then,
just see a hill.

01:23:54.935 --> 01:23:57.552
Where Bronco looked at it,
what do you suppose he saw?

01:24:01.879 --> 01:24:03.035
A barking dog.

01:24:04.659 --> 01:24:06.597
What the hell?
You just saw that now?

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780
No.

01:24:08.899 --> 01:24:10.308
When I first came here,

01:24:10.844 --> 01:24:14.984
see, it looks like a dog
with its jaw wide open.

01:24:17.932 --> 01:24:19.468
You just saw that.

01:24:20.745 --> 01:24:21.697
Yeah.

01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:27.879
Peter,

01:24:29.654 --> 01:24:30.537
Peter,

01:24:33.084 --> 01:24:34.704
can you come in and talk for a little?

01:24:46.441 --> 01:24:47.770
You've gotten to be

01:24:49.114 --> 01:24:50.844
quite friendly with Phil.
Haven't you?

01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:56.754
Is he nice to you?

01:24:59.663 --> 01:25:01.417
He's making a rope for me.

01:25:02.826 --> 01:25:04.193
Making a rope?

01:25:06.724 --> 01:25:09.559
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make
that song with your comb.

01:25:12.864 --> 01:25:13.884
I wasn't aware.

01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:15.933
When I was little, I,

01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:17.941
I felt a chill in my spine
when I heard

01:25:18.024 --> 01:25:20.201
the chalk squeak
on a blackboard.

01:25:22.653 --> 01:25:26.020
Oh, Mrs. Merchant,
that's who it was.

01:25:26.794 --> 01:25:32.145
She, she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard.

01:25:34.114 --> 01:25:36.571
I wonder why it was
stars she gave us.

01:25:37.941 --> 01:25:41.848
Why not diamonds,
why not hearts?

01:25:42.565 --> 01:25:44.441
Why not spades?

01:25:44.524 --> 01:25:45.633
What?

01:25:49.367 --> 01:25:50.914
I wonder why it was…

01:25:51.984 --> 01:25:53.382
always stars.

01:25:54.437 --> 01:25:56.804
Because stars are supposed to be
unreachable.

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.101
Yes.

01:26:02.135 --> 01:26:05.601
They weren't unreachable
because she gave them to us.

01:26:09.604 --> 01:26:11.191
-And Peter?
-Huh?

01:26:11.318 --> 01:26:16.124
We had this Valentine box
and it was covered with white Grey paper

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.780
and we would place
big red hearts on it

01:26:22.116 --> 01:26:23.633
lopsided.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:26.194
And you had a great many Valentines.

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:31.256
A great many.

01:26:35.403 --> 01:26:36.746
Because you're beautiful.

01:26:47.826 --> 01:26:50.396
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?

01:26:59.344 --> 01:27:00.628
I don't remember.

01:27:03.774 --> 01:27:05.510
We're not unreachable.

01:27:12.909 --> 01:27:16.026
Hope we're not unreachable.

01:27:16.183 --> 01:27:17.251
Mother,

01:27:17.334 --> 01:27:18.951
you don't have to do this.

01:27:20.179 --> 01:27:22.487
I'll see, you don't have to do it.

01:27:35.877 --> 01:27:37.406
Yeah, cowboy.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.839
This his first week?

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.693
-No, third.
-Third.

01:27:44.115 --> 01:27:45.552
Open up the gate.
Let him out.

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.134
-Are you sure? He's not ready.
-Go on. Let him out.

01:27:55.454 --> 01:27:57.282
<i>Giddy up, Elmer.</i>

01:27:58.634 --> 01:27:59.736
<i>There he goes.</i>

01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:01.720
<i>Camp by the ranch.</i>

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.359
-Whatchu doing?
-Going to give him a hand.

01:28:05.501 --> 01:28:06.602
Don't.

01:28:07.439 --> 01:28:08.589
Let him figure it out.

01:28:10.028 --> 01:28:11.044
Or not.

01:28:13.435 --> 01:28:15.411
You fall off. You get back on.

01:28:16.575 --> 01:28:17.646
<i>Get it over.</i>

01:30:40.643 --> 01:30:41.819
<i>Hey, Pete.</i>

01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.194
<i>Come here.</i>

01:30:46.878 --> 01:30:49.174
Peter, Peter?

01:30:50.985 --> 01:30:52.133
<i>Where are you two off to?</i>

01:30:58.656 --> 01:30:59.688
Peter?

01:31:01.399 --> 01:31:02.985
-Rose?
-Peter.

01:31:05.173 --> 01:31:06.548
Rose, what's the matter?

01:31:11.463 --> 01:31:12.431
Rose.

01:31:12.821 --> 01:31:14.454
Can't Peter go with you today?

01:31:15.409 --> 01:31:18.345
He could but him and Phil
was kind of paired up.

01:31:18.859 --> 01:31:20.151
I don't want that.

01:31:20.299 --> 01:31:22.705
I don't want him to be with Phil at all.

01:31:23.449 --> 01:31:27.237
Rose, he's helping him.

01:31:27.379 --> 01:31:28.823
He taught him how to ride.

01:32:24.559 --> 01:32:25.691
Hey, P for Pal?

01:32:29.899 --> 01:32:31.168
Hey, P for Pal?

01:32:32.389 --> 01:32:33.537
You're gonna help?

01:32:52.369 --> 01:32:54.673
You know, he started
riding as late as you.

01:32:56.072 --> 01:32:57.059
Who?

01:32:57.142 --> 01:32:58.634
Bronco Henry.

01:32:59.586 --> 01:33:02.634
Hadn't done any of it until
he was about your age now.

01:33:08.178 --> 01:33:09.951
Oh, Mr. Cottontail.

01:33:17.145 --> 01:33:18.082
Hey, Peter.

01:33:18.689 --> 01:33:22.891
You see how long it takes before
Mr. Cottontail makes a run for the open.

01:33:23.869 --> 01:33:24.822
Now,

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:26.309
as kids,

01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:27.962
we used to take bets,

01:33:29.016 --> 01:33:30.996
on how many poles we remove

01:33:31.079 --> 01:33:32.751
before any animals run out

01:33:33.757 --> 01:33:35.329
and made a run for it.

01:33:46.227 --> 01:33:47.837
Oh, he's still in there.

01:33:48.979 --> 01:33:50.889
Got you, you little bugger.

01:33:50.972 --> 01:33:52.588
I get he has to be gutsy.

01:33:52.674 --> 01:33:53.550
Yeah.

01:34:01.587 --> 01:34:03.477
Damn, son of a bitch.

01:34:09.444 --> 01:34:10.618
Come on now.

01:34:11.095 --> 01:34:12.079
Come on.

01:34:13.845 --> 01:34:15.587
I think it broke his leg.

01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:19.884
Well, for the amount of his misery…

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.399
It's all right.

01:34:43.698 --> 01:34:44.975
That's deep.

01:34:46.417 --> 01:34:47.741
You okay, Phil?

01:34:48.003 --> 01:34:49.339
Oh, what the hell?

01:34:50.804 --> 01:34:52.710
Must be a splinter.

01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:13.512
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.

01:35:20.404 --> 01:35:21.942
Bronco Henry told me that

01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:27.028
a man was made by patience
in the odds against him.

01:35:32.424 --> 01:35:34.133
My father said

01:35:35.369 --> 01:35:36.470
obstacles.

01:35:38.783 --> 01:35:40.472
And you had to try
and remove them.

01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:41.840
Another way to put it.

01:35:43.974 --> 01:35:45.207
Well,

01:35:45.708 --> 01:35:48.754
you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, nearby.

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:51.331
Obstacles.

01:35:51.414 --> 01:35:52.671
Take your Ma.

01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:56.447
Today or any day,

01:35:58.191 --> 01:35:59.706
how she's on the sauce.

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:01.909
On the sauce?

01:36:04.222 --> 01:36:05.784
Drinking, Pete.

01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:07.574
Boozing it up.

01:36:12.006 --> 01:36:14.107
Because you know she's been
half shot all summer.

01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:16.490
Yeah, I know.

01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:20.702
She never used to drink.

01:36:21.389 --> 01:36:22.657
Oh, didn't she now?

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.747
No.

01:36:25.138 --> 01:36:26.256
She never did.

01:36:26.459 --> 01:36:27.810
But your Pa, Pete.

01:36:29.357 --> 01:36:31.990
-My father?
-Yeah, your father.

01:36:34.969 --> 01:36:36.929
I guess he hit the bottle
pretty hard.

01:36:38.261 --> 01:36:39.480
The booze.

01:36:42.369 --> 01:36:44.118
Until right at the very end,

01:36:50.081 --> 01:36:51.347
then he hung himself.

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:57.591
I found him,

01:37:01.329 --> 01:37:02.469
cut him down.

01:37:10.599 --> 01:37:13.018
He used to worry
I wasn't kind enough.

01:37:16.468 --> 01:37:17.736
Then I was too strong.

01:37:17.819 --> 01:37:19.237
You, too strong?

01:37:19.792 --> 01:37:20.807
Huh!

01:37:21.359 --> 01:37:22.776
He got that wrong.

01:37:24.819 --> 01:37:25.940
Poor kid.

01:37:31.389 --> 01:37:33.292
Things will work out for you yet.

01:37:44.789 --> 01:37:46.210
Where's Mrs. Lewis?

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.491
She's with the Indians.

01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:51.708
What Indians?

01:37:53.975 --> 01:37:55.177
These ones.

01:38:00.218 --> 01:38:01.429
<i>Go now, go.</i>

01:38:07.538 --> 01:38:08.843
Water.

01:38:10.653 --> 01:38:13.652
I was standing right in front of
the damn things asking,

01:38:13.905 --> 01:38:15.897
do we have any hides?

01:38:18.093 --> 01:38:20.066
Do we have any hides?

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:21.673
Are they leaving?

01:38:23.283 --> 01:38:25.501
Yes, they've got their horse going.

01:38:26.944 --> 01:38:29.241
I told them the hides
are gonna be burned.

01:38:33.843 --> 01:38:34.889
Why?

01:38:35.702 --> 01:38:37.670
Why are the hides
going to be burned?

01:38:37.803 --> 01:38:39.936
Phil doesn't want anyone else
to have them.

01:38:40.451 --> 01:38:42.537
Wait till there's a big pile and

01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:44.759
set fire to the lot.

01:38:44.842 --> 01:38:47.162
He'd blow up if they even touched them.

01:38:48.514 --> 01:38:49.514
What?

01:38:49.905 --> 01:38:51.139
What's she doing?

01:39:08.287 --> 01:39:10.263
Please, please.

01:39:11.647 --> 01:39:13.662
Wait. Please.

01:39:16.162 --> 01:39:17.016
Wait.

01:39:17.099 --> 01:39:18.736
Please, please stop.

01:39:23.539 --> 01:39:24.734
Come back.

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:26.622
Take the hides.

01:39:27.049 --> 01:39:28.958
It would be my honor.

01:39:29.329 --> 01:39:30.872
If you would take them.

01:39:32.274 --> 01:39:33.341
Please.

01:39:34.579 --> 01:39:36.521
My husband owns the ranch.

01:39:39.049 --> 01:39:40.966
Come back and take them.

01:39:43.153 --> 01:39:44.474
-

01:40:12.122 --> 01:40:13.449
They are so soft.

01:40:17.007 --> 01:40:18.984
So precious, these gloves.

01:40:20.498 --> 01:40:21.741
So beautiful.

01:40:47.459 --> 01:40:48.526
You all right, ma'am?

01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:49.935
Is she breathing?

01:40:50.138 --> 01:40:51.107
Ma'am?

01:40:52.099 --> 01:40:53.468
-Ma'am.
-What happened?

01:40:54.049 --> 01:40:55.624
She just collapsed, sir.

01:40:59.008 --> 01:41:00.266
Rose?

01:41:21.746 --> 01:41:23.019
I'm sorry, sir.

01:41:24.379 --> 01:41:25.687
Thank you, Lola.

01:41:58.843 --> 01:42:00.569
I'll be damned.

01:42:00.695 --> 01:42:01.609
Go!

01:42:12.007 --> 01:42:13.601
Is there something wrong, Phil?

01:42:13.882 --> 01:42:14.850
Wrong?

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.945
I'm feeling sick.

01:42:17.296 --> 01:42:20.320
Every goddamn hide is gone.

01:42:20.788 --> 01:42:23.960
Oh, she really put her
foot into it this time.

01:42:25.334 --> 01:42:26.921
You think she did it?

01:42:27.395 --> 01:42:28.477
She sold them?

01:42:30.958 --> 01:42:32.911
Maybe even gave them away.

01:42:33.004 --> 01:42:36.126
Why, why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.

01:42:36.209 --> 01:42:38.456
Because she was.

01:42:39.047 --> 01:42:41.757
Pie-eyed, she was smashed.

01:42:43.128 --> 01:42:46.120
You think you know from the books
your Pa left you that your Ma's got…

01:42:46.534 --> 01:42:47.917
what would you call it?

01:42:48.049 --> 01:42:51.979
Alcoholic personality comes
under the light in her head.

01:42:59.534 --> 01:43:01.414
You're not gonna say anything to her.

01:43:01.497 --> 01:43:02.565
Say anything?

01:43:02.974 --> 01:43:04.301
Oh, I'll say nothing.

01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:09.278
But sure as one good hell
brother George is going to.

01:43:18.426 --> 01:43:20.489
Rose is not well, Phil.

01:43:22.958 --> 01:43:23.943
She's ill.

01:43:26.161 --> 01:43:28.315
Not well?

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.808
It is high time that that
bozo in you got next to a few

01:43:34.084 --> 01:43:36.028
what do you ever call them, facts?

01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:42.036
She stashes alcohol all around the place,
she's even drinking in the stinking alley.

01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:46.083
Look at your face in the mirror.

01:43:46.372 --> 01:43:49.085
Is it that she could like
or our money?

01:43:49.168 --> 01:43:50.831
Wake the hell up!

01:43:50.914 --> 01:43:52.034
That's enough, Phil.

01:43:57.274 --> 01:43:59.703
Well, what is the harm?

01:44:00.784 --> 01:44:02.846
The hides were only going to be burned.

01:44:03.574 --> 01:44:04.776
I needed them.

01:44:06.244 --> 01:44:07.534
I needed them.

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.150
Well, I apologize.

01:44:22.499 --> 01:44:24.233
They were mine.

01:44:27.593 --> 01:44:29.100
I needed them.

01:44:45.062 --> 01:44:45.921
Phil?

01:44:46.327 --> 01:44:47.445
Huh?

01:44:53.859 --> 01:44:54.804
Phil, I've…

01:44:57.218 --> 01:44:59.194
I've got a raw hide to finish the rope.

01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:02.624
You got it?

01:45:03.091 --> 01:45:04.952
What were you doing
with the raw hide?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.859
I cut some up.

01:45:08.077 --> 01:45:09.420
I wanted to be like you.

01:45:11.616 --> 01:45:13.441
Please take what I've got.

01:45:18.374 --> 01:45:20.288
It's damn kind of you, Pete.

01:45:35.444 --> 01:45:36.812
I'll tell you something.

01:45:39.766 --> 01:45:43.221
Everything's going to be plain
sailing for you from now on here.

01:45:46.999 --> 01:45:48.218
You know,

01:45:49.083 --> 01:45:50.467
I'm going to work.

01:45:51.475 --> 01:45:53.282
Finish up that rope thing, right?

01:45:56.561 --> 01:45:58.030
You watch me do it.

01:48:17.769 --> 01:48:20.207
IN LOVING MEMORY, BRONCO HENRY,
FRIEND, 1854-1904

01:48:27.394 --> 01:48:29.714
How old were you when you met
Bronco Henry?

01:48:31.778 --> 01:48:33.551
About the age you are now.

01:48:43.713 --> 01:48:45.400
Was he your best friend?

01:48:46.306 --> 01:48:47.341
Yeah.

01:48:48.935 --> 01:48:50.074
He was.

01:48:51.184 --> 01:48:52.277
But more than that.

01:48:54.568 --> 01:48:56.130
Once he saved my life.

01:49:02.959 --> 01:49:07.365
We were way off up in the hills,
shooting out and the weather turned mean.

01:49:09.591 --> 01:49:11.450
Bronco kept me alive by

01:49:12.833 --> 01:49:15.529
lying body against body in a bed roll.

01:49:18.679 --> 01:49:20.708
Fell off to sleep that way.

01:49:26.335 --> 01:49:27.497
Naked?

01:51:23.516 --> 01:51:25.855
-Phil left already?
-No, he's not here.

01:51:28.075 --> 01:51:29.972
You say he was setting out early?

01:51:30.055 --> 01:51:31.076
No?

01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:38.014
Good morning.

01:51:38.734 --> 01:51:40.146
Have you seen your brother?

01:51:42.553 --> 01:51:44.201
He's not had breakfast?

01:51:46.039 --> 01:51:47.544
He's not been down at all.

01:52:11.006 --> 01:52:13.217
I'll run you onto Herndon.
See the doctor.

01:52:39.113 --> 01:52:40.254
Phil.

01:52:42.065 --> 01:52:43.669
What happened to your hand?

01:52:47.074 --> 01:52:48.870
Let's get your boots off.

01:52:59.446 --> 01:53:01.097
No, I'm good.

01:53:09.509 --> 01:53:11.370
I'll get the car.

01:54:17.256 --> 01:54:18.530
Let's go, Phil.

01:54:19.639 --> 01:54:21.171
Where's the boy?

01:54:44.358 --> 01:54:45.381
Phil?

01:54:54.643 --> 01:54:55.948
I'll get it to him.

01:55:49.165 --> 01:55:50.501
I'll take this one.

01:57:55.583 --> 01:57:56.667
Rose,

01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:59.053
would like you to join us for Christmas.

01:58:00.255 --> 01:58:02.544
If you'd care to.

01:58:05.818 --> 01:58:06.802
Yeah.

01:58:07.895 --> 01:58:08.896
Thank you, George.

01:58:14.479 --> 01:58:16.035
I'm afraid I'm mystified.

01:58:16.653 --> 01:58:19.419
We'll know in a day or two
when results come back.

01:58:20.119 --> 01:58:21.582
Those last convulsions.

01:58:23.809 --> 01:58:25.099
-Yes.
-Terrible.

01:58:25.758 --> 01:58:27.132
Truly frightful.

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.701
You know, what I'm thinking?

01:58:31.298 --> 01:58:32.521
What?

01:58:33.185 --> 01:58:34.412
Anthrax.

01:58:38.928 --> 01:58:44.119
But he never handled diseased animals.
He was particular on that.

01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:31.504
THE ORDER FOR THE
BURIAL OF THE DEAD.

01:59:40.558 --> 01:59:42.776
"Deliver my soul from the sword;

01:59:42.996 --> 01:59:45.503
my darling from the power of the dog."
