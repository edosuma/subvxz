00:03.069 --> 00:04.738
  When we were in
  junior high, my father
  promised to take me skiing

00:04.771 --> 00:06.239
  if I got a B on
  my history midterm.

00:06.272 --> 00:09.576
 After cramming for
 the test night and day,
 I knew I couldn't pull it off.

00:09.609 --> 00:13.413
  So I got Screech to let his
  pet rats loose, in order to
get the test postponed.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.459
   Zack, what are you doing?

00:26.493 --> 00:28.395
   Studying.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.730
 Belding must be
 putting something
 in the food.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.166
   Hey, everybody!
   Zack's studying!

00:36.870 --> 00:38.238
  Zack, are you okay?

00:39.539 --> 00:40.573
   He feels normal.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.876
  I feel normal, too.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.645
But you're not.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.714
   Come on.
   Haven't you ever seen me
   study before?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.149
  No.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.217
 Look, I'm desperate.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.453
  My dad said he'd take me
  skiing if I got a good grade
  on the history midterm.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.521
   How good a grade?

00:54.554 --> 00:55.655
I just have to get a B.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.425
 A B?
 ( all laugh )

00:58.458 --> 01:00.493
 You gotta be kidding me, a B?

01:00.527 --> 01:04.263
 I think it would be easier
 if you just got another dad.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.399
( bell rings )

01:06.433 --> 01:09.169
 <i>* When I wake up</i>
 <i>in the morning and</i>
 <i>the alarm gives out a warning</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:12.205
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:15.108
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

01:15.141 --> 01:18.578
 <i>* I'm at</i>
 <i>the corner just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

01:18.611 --> 01:22.816
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:24.384 --> 01:27.420
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:27.454 --> 01:30.423
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:30.457 --> 01:33.159
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:33.193 --> 01:36.796
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

01:36.830 --> 01:41.167
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:54.981 --> 01:58.218
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:58.251 --> 02:00.854
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

02:00.887 --> 02:05.592
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

02:11.464 --> 02:14.200
Carrie: <i>Midterms</i>
<i>are a lot of hard work</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

02:14.234 --> 02:16.903
 <i>But while most students</i>
 <i>study hard for the big test,</i>

02:16.936 --> 02:20.607
 <i>there's always</i>
 <i>one who's looking</i>
 <i>for the easy way out.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:23.543
   <i>Three guess who</i>
   <i>it is this year.</i>

02:23.576 --> 02:26.746
  Okay.
  Let's talk about midterms.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.350
 You know, in Sweden they have
 a completely different system.

02:30.383 --> 02:34.287
  They give the grade,
  usually a B,
  before the midterm.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.791
   It takes the pressure off
   the student and leaves his
   brain free to learn.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.427
  ( in mock Swedish )
  Oh, yah, sure.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.630
 Could it be possible

02:43.663 --> 02:47.767
   that none of you've heard
   of the Bliss Challenge of
the Eighth Grade Stars?

02:47.801 --> 02:48.835
 Yeah.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.705
  And, the best part of it is

02:51.738 --> 02:54.874
  the members of
  the winning team
  will receive this.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.379
 That's it? A t-shirt?

02:59.412 --> 03:03.183
  Ah, not just any
  old t-shirt, Lisa,

03:03.216 --> 03:05.418
but a magical t-shirt.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.921
 And what kind of
 powers does it have?

03:07.954 --> 03:11.224
   Well,
   anyone wearing this shirt

03:11.257 --> 03:13.860
 will disappear
 from class on Friday

03:13.893 --> 03:17.464
 and magically
 reappear in Cosmos for pizza.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.566
  ( class exclaims )

03:19.599 --> 03:24.637
   Wow, teleportation!
   I can't wait
   for the Bliss Challenge.

03:24.671 --> 03:28.842
  Screech, the Bliss Challenge
  for you would be not getting
any pizza on your shirt.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.648
( microphone tapping )

03:35.682 --> 03:37.851
  Attention.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.820
   Attention, everyone.
   I am pleased to announce

03:40.854 --> 03:44.357
 that our Ms.
 Bliss has been chosen
 as a finalist

03:44.391 --> 03:48.628
  for <i>School Days</i> magazine's
  teacher of the year award.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.696
  Thank you.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.233
 Wow, that is quite an honor.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.835
   Isn't it wonderful?
   I am so excited.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.405
 You're excited?
 I thought I was the nominee.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.807
 Well,
 sure it's good for you, too.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.411
  Just think of
  all the recognition
  you'll gain for our school.

04:04.444 --> 04:07.514
 I think it's a little
 early to start writing
 my acceptance speech.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.849
   Relax. You are a shoe-in.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.452
   As your principal, I'll be
   at the banquet with you.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.922
 And this will give you a great
 chance to thank those few,
 special people

04:15.955 --> 04:17.490
   who've helped you
   along the way.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.793
 That's right.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.661
  - My parents...
  - Mmm-hmm.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.798
   ...Mr. Lyman,
   my eighth grade teacher,
   and, uh...

04:25.932 --> 04:27.233
   that's about it.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
 Aren't you forgetting someone?

04:30.303 --> 04:31.938
  Of course.

04:31.971 --> 04:35.575
   My students.
   You can't be a teacher
   without students.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.643
 Anyone else?

04:37.344 --> 04:39.546
 - No.
 - No?

04:39.579 --> 04:41.581
I'm joking. ( laughs )

04:41.614 --> 04:42.649
 ( chucking ) Oh, you.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.552
   How could I forget Mylo?

04:48.888 --> 04:49.923
 Screech: See you later, guys.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.991
 Oh, hi, Zack.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.961
 - ( Sighs )
 - Is something wrong?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.666
All right, all right.
If you gotta know,
I'll tell you.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.736
  I gotta postpone the midterm,
  so I can
  study and get a B.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.437
 You can't postpone a midterm.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.506
 Okay, fine. Take their side.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.875
   - The one time I need you...
   - The last time
   you said that to me,

05:08.908 --> 05:12.779
 I ended up on
 a bus wearing nothing
 but my boxer shorts.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.682
  You see?
  I have done things for you.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.585
 - All right. What do you need?
 - Your rats.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.919
Spin and Marty?

05:19.953 --> 05:22.822
 Picture this,
 two rats get loose at school,

05:22.856 --> 05:25.658
they close the school,
they postpone the test,
 I go skiing.

05:25.692 --> 05:29.462
( scoffs ) No way.
I'm not taking any part
in this.

05:29.496 --> 05:33.366
   Did I mention you
   and me going out
   with the Zeferelli twins?

05:33.400 --> 05:36.069
 The Zeferelli twins?
 Count me in.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.337
  All right.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.872
 - Which twin do I get?
 - Aura.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.408
- Which one is she?
- The one on the left.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.649
 Is that Carrie Bliss,
 Indiana's
 teacher of the year?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.551
  Kind of gives you the chills,
  doesn't it?

05:51.584 --> 05:53.987
  Oh, Mr.
  Belding, I haven't won yet.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.890
   They still have
   to interview me
   and observe my teaching.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.659
Hey, when they see your
Challenge of
the Eighth Grade Stars

05:59.693 --> 06:01.661
   you'll be a cinch to win.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.798
 It's just
 the thing you need to beat
 that McMillan guy.

06:04.831 --> 06:08.935
 Joseph McMillan of Glen Ridge?
 Oh, he's a great teacher.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.537
 They wrote a book about him.

06:10.570 --> 06:14.074
 Big deal, one book. If it was
 so good, why didn't they
 make a movie out of it?

06:14.107 --> 06:18.078
   Oh, come on, Mr. Belding.
   It's an honor just to be
 a finalist with him.

06:18.111 --> 06:22.849
  You believe that? Listen,
  when you're in a contest,
  you're in it for one reason,

06:22.882 --> 06:24.884
to win.

06:24.918 --> 06:28.755
  Nobody remembers who came in
  second in the javelin throw
  at the '84 Olympics.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.523
 David Ottley of Great Britain.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.666
  Hey, Screech.
  Did you set the rats free?

06:39.699 --> 06:41.634
   First thing this morning.

06:41.668 --> 06:44.904
   It was very emotional.
   You know,
   the empty nest syndrome.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.507
You guys are never
going to believe this.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.510
 I was in
 the girls' room putting on
 my make-up, when I looked over

06:50.543 --> 06:53.446
 and saw this big rat
 sharing my lipstick.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.416
  That's Spin. He's
  having an identity crisis.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.851
 Well, I hope you reported it.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.754
   I would've but he
   ate the evidence.

07:00.787 --> 07:04.758
   All right, who took
   a hunk out of my Twinkie?

07:04.791 --> 07:07.527
 Hmm.
 Looks like a rat bite to me.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.064
That's Marty.
He's gonna have a zit
in the morning.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.766
  Come on.
  Let's go tell Mr. Belding.

07:12.799 --> 07:16.069
 - Hey, good idea.
 - I'll go find Mylo.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.040
   This is going great.
   Now we've got to keep
 the ball rolling.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.509
 - Oh, Ms. Paladrino.
 - Yes, Zack.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.544
 You know,
 I'm very impressed with you.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.646
 Oh, thank you, Zack.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.549
   Not everybody can keep
   their cool with all these
   rats running around.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.952
  Oh, come on, Zack. You know
  how these rumors get
  started at school.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.120
( students screaming )

07:37.057 --> 07:38.124
Rumors?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.062
  Has that rat been in here?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.964
   See, I've been
   tracking that little joker
   all the way from the gym.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.067
   Now, which way did he go?

07:49.703 --> 07:52.505
 See,
 I know the rat mind, baby.
 Mmm-hmm.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.808
First to the gym
for a little exercise,

07:54.841 --> 07:56.910
   then to
   the cafeteria for lunch,

07:56.943 --> 08:00.847
 and now he's gonna
 go to the music room
 to relax and digest.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.017
 And you're gonna catch
 him and set him free.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.354
   Well, close.
   I'm gonna catch him
   and set him dead.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.522
  My babies!

08:12.392 --> 08:15.562
Carrie Bliss, this is Dr.
Atwater
from the <i>School Days</i> magazine.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.133
   - Nice to meet you.
   - Nice to meet you, too.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.770
 - Where are your students?
 - Oh, this is my free period.

08:23.803 --> 08:28.441
  Good.
  Could we secure the doors,
  just to ensure our privacy?

08:28.475 --> 08:31.578
 Of course. We can secure
 the doors, the windows,
 the lights. Anything you want.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.480
 Could you just please do it?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
 - Certainly.
 - Thank you.

08:41.654 --> 08:45.525
 Question number one has to do
 with the principal-teacher
 relationship.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.927
 Oh, Mr. Belding and
 I work hand in hand.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.831
 That's right.
 We have a very close
 relationship. We're like this.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.903
  Well, I don't mean like this.
  I'm a happily married man.
  ( chuckles )

08:59.072 --> 09:03.476
  If you had a gifted student,
  would you ever consider
  skipping him a grade?

09:03.510 --> 09:06.079
 - Of course, she wouldn't.
 - Yes, I would.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.482
 Of course, she would.

09:09.516 --> 09:13.853
 Dr. Atwater, I feel
 that holding back a gifted
 child can be damaging

09:13.887 --> 09:16.456
  to his sense of self-worth.

09:16.489 --> 09:19.526
 - ( door rattling )
 - Mylo: Mr. Belding.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.861
   - Uh, we have to talk.
   - Not now, Mylo.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.800
 - Then when?
 - I don't know. About an hour?

09:26.833 --> 09:31.104
  - We don't have an hour.
  - All right. What is it,
 Myl... ( chuckles )

09:32.806 --> 09:35.141
I mean, how may I
help you, Mr. Williams?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.812
 ( inaudible )

09:38.845 --> 09:42.615
( laughs )
Excuse us for a moment, Dr.
Atwater.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.053
Belding: Rats?

09:47.053 --> 09:49.923
  Mylo, I just can't
  believe my school is
  infested with rats.

09:49.956 --> 09:52.058
Then don't. But it is.

09:52.058 --> 09:55.695
  I bet McMillan over at
  Glen Ridge bred those little
  suckers in his biology lab

09:55.729 --> 09:57.897
  and sent them here.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.568
   He didn't do that. I mean,
   no one in the educational
   system would go that far

10:01.601 --> 10:02.702
   to win an award.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.604
   I would.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.907
  Well, it's just that I
  want Ms. Bliss to win
  this award so much.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.210
 Mylo, we just can't
 shut down the school.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.911
   Look here,
   my hands are tied, okay?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.647
Now, either Shorty
Beamon's crew comes in
and cleans it out now,

10:14.681 --> 10:17.283
or we'll be front-page news
when the health
department finds out.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.219
  Okay, okay.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.223
  Are you sure can't
  just hold off on this
  for another couple of days?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.924
See, that's a "Uh-uh."

10:24.958 --> 10:30.897
  See, Rule 1070 says,
  "Take no chances
  with rats."

10:30.930 --> 10:33.833
 There's more,
 but the rest of the page's
 been chewed.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.236
  ( blowing into microphone )

10:37.137 --> 10:38.171
  Belding: <i>Is this thing on?</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.640
 <i>Attention, students.</i>

10:40.674 --> 10:44.711
<i>Due to a rat infestation</i>
<i>we are forced to close</i>
<i>the school for one week</i>

10:44.744 --> 10:46.012
  <i>beginning tomorrow.</i>

10:46.046 --> 10:48.214
 ( students exclaim )

10:48.248 --> 10:52.118
   Well, class. It looks
   like you get another week
   to study for the midterm.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.921
 We did it! Everything's great.

10:54.954 --> 10:59.225
   For you, maybe. I found Spin
   but I can't find Marty.

10:59.259 --> 11:03.797
 Spin was so worried about him
 that he stayed up all night,
 pacing on his wheel.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.598
   It tears your heart out.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.666
( bell rings )

11:09.069 --> 11:10.570
  Ms. Bliss,

11:10.603 --> 11:15.175
 I'm afraid Dr. Atwater can't
 reschedule her observation of
 your class tomorrow.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.977
 If only she could have
 seen your Battle of
 the Eighth Grade Stars

11:18.078 --> 11:20.714
 we would've won
 teacher of the year for sure.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.749
   I'm really sorry.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.099
   Do you have to sit in
   the middle of the stairs?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.935
 Sorry, Nikki.

11:41.968 --> 11:45.705
  "Sorry, Nikki"?
  Zack, are you okay?

11:45.739 --> 11:49.109
 Nikki, I did
 something even I'm ashamed of.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.012
 I'd better sit down for this.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.782
 When Ms. Bliss doesn't get
 the teacher of the year award,
 I'll be responsible.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.851
 Zack,

11:57.884 --> 12:01.488
 they're not going to hold it
 against her that in 11 years
 of teaching she has one dweeb.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.057
   If only they could've
   seen her Bliss Challenge.

12:04.090 --> 12:08.128
   Come on, Zack. You didn't
   have anything to do with
   the closing of the school.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.196
  You didn't put the rats in.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.267
  Nikki,
  you're talking to King Rat.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.602
 Zack, how could you?

12:15.635 --> 12:18.872
Well, I needed more
time to study so I could
get a B and go skiing.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.808
And you thought
if you studied more
you'd get a B?

12:22.642 --> 12:24.544
  You're right. I am a dweeb.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.081
- You gotta tell Ms. Bliss.
- But that would
mean I'd have to...

12:28.114 --> 12:30.984
  - ...tell the truth.
  - Zack, just do it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.085
  Look,
  I'll help you study, okay?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.890
   Oh, Zack, one more thing.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.627
 I don't think I've ever heard
 you tell the truth before.
 Can I be there?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.996
   Hey, I'll pay you money.

12:46.099 --> 12:51.104
 Carrie, I just heard about
 Dr. Atwater not being able to
 see your review.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.672
Oh, you must be upset.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.108
  No, I'm not upset.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.176
  Very upset.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.646
 I know how you feel.

12:59.679 --> 13:03.950
 When I graduated from college
 I auditioned for a dance
 program at Julliard.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.920
  - I didn't know
  you went to Julliard.
  - I didn't.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.122
 When I left Ohio,
 my parents told me to

13:09.155 --> 13:11.858
  break a leg when I
  hit the Big Apple.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.060
  And I did.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.596
   The day before the try-out,
   there was
   a big storm in New York,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.065
   and I slipped on the ice.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.267
By the time it healed,
there were no openings.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.570
Oh, Tina. I'm so sorry.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.572
   Ah, well. I got over it.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.141
  Besides, I never
  really had the right look
  for ballet.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.277
   My tutu always
   looked like a two-three.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.948
  I never thought
  awards had anything to do
  with teaching.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.585
 But that was
 before I came so close
 to winning.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.955
 I really wanted
 someone to say,
 "That's Carrie Bliss.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.090
"She's a good teacher."

13:44.924 --> 13:46.860
  I really wanted this award.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.162
 That's it, Carrie. Let it out.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.299
   - I want this award.
   - Louder!

13:53.333 --> 13:56.770
  - I want this award.
  - Yes, let it out!

13:56.803 --> 13:59.339
  I want this award!

13:59.372 --> 14:01.608
 Oh, hi, Zack.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.710
  Uh, there's
  something I gotta tell you.

14:10.784 --> 14:14.587
   Come on.
   Sit down and relax, Screech.
   It won't be that bad.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.191
   - Trust me.
   - I already did,
   and that's why I'm here.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.795
 I've never been sent
 to
 the principal's office before.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.905
 Why isn't he saying anything?

14:31.938 --> 14:34.307
   Ah, he's just
   trying to intimidate us.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.778
 It's working.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.950
   Boys, you'll be
   glad to know there is
   school tomorrow.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.652
Ms. Bliss will be
able to show her stuff.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.088
 - Hey, that's great.
 - You each have
 two weeks detention.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.090
Ah, that's not.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.727
  But, there may be a way
  to have your detention time
  reduced by a week.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.261
  Sounds good to me.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.398
 I want you and your
 classmates to help
 convince Dr. Atwater

14:58.431 --> 15:02.702
  that Ms.
  Bliss is the greatest teacher
  in the world.

15:02.736 --> 15:07.340
 - Well, what can we do?
 - For starters,
 don't be yourselves.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.848
   - Ready, class?
   - Ready.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.390
- Who am I?
- I don't know,

15:23.423 --> 15:27.127
  but when
  the circus comes to town,
  you'll have a job.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.430
   Okay, here's a clue.
   I was
   the eighteenth president.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.498
( bell rings )

15:31.531 --> 15:34.167
 - Ulysses S. Grant.
 - Very good.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.403
 - ( students exclaim )
 - Student 1: Oh, man.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.973
   And, who was
   the President before me,
   and what happened to him

15:40.073 --> 15:42.942
  that never happened
  to any other President
  during his term of office.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.644
( bell rings )

15:44.678 --> 15:46.546
  - Andrew Johnson,
  and he was impeached.
  - Right.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.614
  (students exclaim)

15:54.087 --> 15:57.824
   "Speak softly and
   carry a big stick."
   Who am I?

15:57.857 --> 15:58.892
( bell rings )

15:58.925 --> 16:01.094
My father when I
come home late.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.830
 - Wrong.
 - Hey, that was just a joke.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.533
  Then you have three
  seconds to give me
  the correct answer.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.401
   - Teddy Roosevelt.
   - Right.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.469
  (students exclaim)

16:15.141 --> 16:18.778
Toss-up question
for five points.
The Wright brothers...

16:19.879 --> 16:22.115
- Orville and Wilbur.
- Right answer, Mikey.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.919
  But wrong question.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.126
 The Wright brothers completed
 the first manned airplane
 flight at Kitty Hawk.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.161
In what state is
Kitty Hawk to be found?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.097
( bell rings )

16:37.130 --> 16:40.066
 Oh, gee. It's right on
 the tip of my tongue.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.837
  Come on, Zack.
  You know the answer.
  We went over it yesterday.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.238
 Ten seconds.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.207
 If you think about it,
 the Wright brothers
 were really

16:47.240 --> 16:49.075
   the godfathers of
   our space program,

16:49.109 --> 16:50.944
 - yet...
 - Three, two, one...

16:50.977 --> 16:52.212
   - Zack!
   - North Carolina.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.215
  Correct. And just in time.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.517
   Why do you do that to me?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.586
Because I can.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.761
   All right, class.
   It's halftime.

17:07.794 --> 17:12.031
 When we resume the category
 will be our founding fathers.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.733
   Remember, guys.
   Lay it on thick.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.704
  Hello, again, Dr. Atwater.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.741
Are there
always this many kids
in your class?

17:21.775 --> 17:22.809
   Usually.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.944
 ( chuckles )

17:25.811 --> 17:28.147
 Would you like to take a seat?

17:28.181 --> 17:31.785
 All right, class.
 Halftime over. Hands on bells.

17:36.256 --> 17:40.794
   Our founding fathers.
   What year did the pilgrims
   land at Plymouth Rock?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.861
 ( all ringing bells )

17:42.595 --> 17:44.097
Mikey, you were first.

17:44.130 --> 17:48.068
  Ms.
  Bliss, due to your refreshing
  teaching style...

17:48.068 --> 17:50.704
  ...as long as I live
  I will always

17:50.737 --> 17:52.872
   remember that the pilgrims
   landed at Plymouth Rock

17:52.906 --> 17:54.607
   in 1620.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.943
  That's five brownie points.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.780
 Okay, a toss-up.
 Complete this phrase:

18:00.814 --> 18:02.148
   The lost colony of what?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.783
 ( all ringing bells )

18:03.817 --> 18:06.152
My, you're all so
eager all of a sudden.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.122
  That's because
  you're teaching makes us
  so eager to learn.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.192
I mean, after all,
isn't that what teaching is
really all about?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.259
( students applauding )

18:14.627 --> 18:16.229
  Answer the question, Zack.

18:16.262 --> 18:21.101
- Oh, sure.
The lost colony of Roanoke.
- Correct.

18:21.134 --> 18:27.173
  And, for five bonus points,
  can anyone tell me where
  the lost colony is located?

18:27.207 --> 18:28.842
( bell rings )

18:28.875 --> 18:31.745
 No one knows, Ms.
 Bliss. That's why it's lost.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.213
 ( students laughing )

18:34.714 --> 18:37.283
   When we're not learning,
   we're laughing.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.854
   Cut the clowning around,
   Samuel.

18:40.887 --> 18:46.092
   You know, her warmth,
   her charm, her effortless
   command of the class...

18:46.126 --> 18:49.062
I don't know
about you, but I've
got goosebumps.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.698
 Her teaching methods
 are very impressive.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.701
- And one other thing.
- What's that?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.637
 Never touch me again.

18:57.671 --> 19:01.141
  - ( bell rings )
  - Ms. Bliss, on
  behalf of the entire class,

19:01.174 --> 19:03.009
   I would just like to say,

19:03.009 --> 19:05.779
 thank you for being
 the best teacher in
 the state of Indiana.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.846
 - I agree. Bravo.
 - ( all applauding )

19:09.015 --> 19:11.785
 Kids.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.189
  I like to record her lessons
  and play them backwards
  for hidden messages. See?

19:17.924 --> 19:20.694
  All right. That's it. Okay.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.063
 Dr. Atwater, I'm very sorry.

19:23.096 --> 19:29.035
 But my students have a midterm
 to prepare for and I need
 their total concentration.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.638
  Which,
  obviously, I'm not getting.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.040
   Could you possibly
   visit us some other time?

19:34.074 --> 19:36.943
 Well, I'm afraid not.
 Our editors are
 meeting tomorrow

19:37.043 --> 19:39.646
   to make a decision
   on the winner.

19:39.679 --> 19:44.351
 Well, if I don't prepare
 my students for their midterm,
 I don't deserve any award.

19:44.384 --> 19:49.255
You do realize if I
leave today this will weigh
heavily on my decision.

19:49.289 --> 19:53.226
  I know. Thank you for coming.
  Good day, Dr. Atwater.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.595
  Goodbye, Ms. Bliss.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.902
   Excellent work... Mikey.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.108
Very nice job... Nikki.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.277
 Ms. Bliss,
 why are you doing this to me?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.345
Because I can.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.649
   Congratulations.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.286
B-plus. Hey, I did it!

20:20.320 --> 20:25.125
  Uh, Ms. Bliss, is it
  possible to take the B now,

20:25.158 --> 20:27.727
   and save the plus
   for a rainy day?

20:27.761 --> 20:30.864
   Have a nice ski trip,
   but watch out for trees.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.667
 Even you can't
 talk your way through
 one of those.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.834
( bell rings )

20:41.274 --> 20:44.878
   Uh, there's something
   I'd like to say, but I...

20:44.911 --> 20:48.048
   - You're not
   sure how to say it?
   - Right.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.783
 Wait up. I want to thank you.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.984
 It's okay. You don't have to.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.919
But I want to.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.422
 Look, Nikki.
 You've always been
 a good friend to me.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.324
   I really appreciate
   that I can count on you.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.061
 Thanks for helping me study.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.762
  Geez, I think you're
  gonna make me cry.

21:02.796 --> 21:05.799
   Hey, I do have
   a way with women, don't I?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.668
   Yeah. You have
   a way to make them sick.

21:10.904 --> 21:16.843
  Ms. Bliss,
  I have in my hand a telegram
  from <i>School Days</i> magazine.

21:16.876 --> 21:21.881
  Oh, it's probably
  just a formality
  to all the losers.

21:21.915 --> 21:23.183
  Go ahead, open it.

21:26.886 --> 21:31.091
   "Dear Ms. Bliss,
   it seems you have an unusual
   approach to teaching.

21:31.091 --> 21:33.860
  "Your dedication...

21:38.298 --> 21:39.866
I won.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.167
  All right!

21:46.840 --> 21:49.242
 ( instrumental music plays )
