WEBVTT

00:05.355 --> 00:07.122
Times square on
new year's eve,

00:07.122 --> 00:09.322
Rockefeller center
around christmastime...

00:09.322 --> 00:10.775
Yeah! But most of all...

00:10.775 --> 00:13.099
A college bar? Oh, man.

00:13.099 --> 00:14.578
We're probably going to
run into my students.

00:14.578 --> 00:17.428
They're going to corner me
and want a free lecture.

00:17.428 --> 00:19.182
I don't even have
my slide projector.

00:19.182 --> 00:19.814
damn it.

00:19.814 --> 00:22.648
Ted, I've been skee-ball
champ here since law school.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.189
I have to pop in at
least once a month

00:24.189 --> 00:25.709
To maintain my record.

00:25.709 --> 00:28.053
Whoa. Looks like you've
been gone a while.

00:28.053 --> 00:30.341
Some guy named big fudge
has been cleaning up.

00:30.341 --> 00:31.796
Yeah, he has.

00:32.359 --> 00:33.673
And you're big fudge.

00:33.673 --> 00:34.931
The biggest.

00:35.601 --> 00:36.929
Um, so by the way,

00:36.929 --> 00:38.785
I-I have to tell you
something. Yeah.

00:38.785 --> 00:41.340
I, uh... invited jenkins.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.106
Jenkins? No way!

00:43.106 --> 00:44.679
We'd all started
hearing about jenkins

00:44.679 --> 00:45.978
A few weeks earlier.

00:46.339 --> 00:49.510
You guys will not believe
what jenkins did this time.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.565
Who's jenkins?

00:50.565 --> 00:51.793
Oh, he's this hilarious

00:51.793 --> 00:53.893
New lawyer at
marshall's office.

00:54.107 --> 00:55.885
Hilarious.

00:56.071 --> 00:58.002
Okay, so there's this jar

00:58.002 --> 00:59.896
Of maraschino cherries
in the fridge at work.

00:59.897 --> 01:01.845
So, jenkins says,

01:01.845 --> 01:05.309
"200 bucks,
I'll eat the whole jar."

01:06.083 --> 01:08.567
So, we give jenkins
200 bucks...

01:16.977 --> 01:18.749
Jenkins.

01:18.749 --> 01:20.781
And after that,
the stories kept coming.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.045
So, the cfo comes in to sign
some acquisition papers.

01:24.045 --> 01:25.515
So, jenkins goes,

01:25.515 --> 01:27.538
"Excuse me, mr. Wilcox.

01:27.538 --> 01:30.447
I think we forgot one
of the documents."

01:36.568 --> 01:38.190
Jenkins!

01:39.115 --> 01:41.195
So, we all go out for
beers after work.

01:41.195 --> 01:44.096
Jenkins gets up on the
bar and starts gyrating

01:44.096 --> 01:46.521
Like some sort of
deranged stripper.

01:46.521 --> 01:49.861
Next thing you know,
off comes the shirt!

01:49.861 --> 01:52.026
It was so gross.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.288
All : jenkins.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.931
Right?

01:55.931 --> 01:58.395
Well, it'll be great to
finally meet the famous
jenkins

01:58.395 --> 02:00.300
After all those stories. Yeah.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.412
And there's about to
be one more story.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.473
I'm going to bang jenkins.

02:04.473 --> 02:06.255
What? You heard me.

02:06.255 --> 02:08.889
You-you want to have
sex with jenkins?

02:08.889 --> 02:11.531
With jenkins, on jenkins,
near jenkins.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.911
You name it. I want to
wear jenkins like a sock.

02:14.911 --> 02:17.511
You... but you're...

02:17.511 --> 02:19.244
Haven't you... i'm...

02:19.244 --> 02:20.910
Really? Woman: hey, guys.

02:21.263 --> 02:22.863
Ted, this is jenkins.

02:23.429 --> 02:25.585
Oh.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.608 --> 02:40.427
Okay, this is going
to sound crazy,

02:40.427 --> 02:43.155
But I thought
jenkins was a guy.

02:43.155 --> 02:44.791
What? That's crazy!

02:44.791 --> 02:46.532
What gave you that idea? Oh,
I don't know.

02:46.532 --> 02:49.306
Maybe the whole "Jenkins peed
out the window of a cab"
Story.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.915
Yeah. Much more
impressive now, isn't it?

02:50.915 --> 02:53.766
Yeah. Okay, I'll come clean!

02:54.185 --> 02:56.105
It all started a
few weeks ago.

02:56.307 --> 02:58.147
By the way, four eyes,
new lawyer.

02:58.147 --> 02:59.466
This is jenkins.

02:59.466 --> 03:00.385
Watch out for this guy.

03:00.385 --> 03:01.785
He steals stuff.

03:01.785 --> 03:03.345
I don't steal stuff.

03:04.381 --> 03:06.465
And I don't wear glasses.

03:07.737 --> 03:09.999
I'm marshall. Hi, marshall.

03:09.999 --> 03:13.828
So, are you really a vikings
fan or was he lying about
that, too?

03:13.828 --> 03:15.613
Why? Is this a trap?

03:15.613 --> 03:16.506
Are you a packers fan?

03:16.506 --> 03:17.663
My wife knows I'm here.

03:17.663 --> 03:19.705
She doesn't have money,
but what she does have

03:19.705 --> 03:21.709
Is a very special
set of skills.

03:22.009 --> 03:23.414
I'm a vikings fan, too!

03:23.414 --> 03:24.631
I bleed purple and gold.

03:24.631 --> 03:26.314
I'm from pelican rapids.

03:26.314 --> 03:27.531
Pelican rapids?

03:27.531 --> 03:28.677
No way. Yeah.

03:28.677 --> 03:30.715
My grandpa lives
in pelican rapids.

03:30.715 --> 03:31.741
Well, I mean, he's dead now,

03:31.741 --> 03:33.925
But he haunts a
barn off route 108.

03:34.341 --> 03:35.295
whoa!

03:35.295 --> 03:36.704
Hold it, hold it. Dude,

03:36.704 --> 03:37.637
If you tell me
you have a thing

03:37.637 --> 03:39.124
For a woman that
is not your wife,

03:39.124 --> 03:41.677
I will drag you outside
and kick your ass.

03:41.677 --> 03:44.860
Okay, first of all...
come on, buddy.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.612
You can't handle the fudge.

03:46.612 --> 03:48.132
Second of all, no.

03:48.132 --> 03:50.886
I think of her like a...
A big brother.

03:50.886 --> 03:52.709
Who, I guess, has boobs.

03:52.709 --> 03:55.226
But so does my oldest brother,
marvin jr. Anyway,

03:55.226 --> 03:57.065
That night,
I told lily about it.

03:57.065 --> 03:58.415
Jenkins.

03:58.415 --> 04:01.148
Aw. I can't wait to meet him.

04:01.148 --> 04:02.764
I should have corrected her.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.856
It would have been so easy.

04:04.925 --> 04:06.726
But I didn't, so,

04:06.726 --> 04:09.085
After that, whenever I
talked about jenkins,

04:09.085 --> 04:11.647
I always avoided pronouns.

04:11.647 --> 04:12.987
So, the head of
marketing comes in

04:12.987 --> 04:15.251
To choose people for
the midwest audit.

04:15.251 --> 04:18.267
So, he goes, "Him, him, her,

04:18.267 --> 04:20.370
"Him, him...

04:20.370 --> 04:22.507
Jenkins, him, her."

04:22.507 --> 04:24.738
Look, I don't understand why
you wouldn't just tell lily.

04:24.738 --> 04:26.428
Do you really think she'd
be all that jealous?

04:26.428 --> 04:28.921
Ted, think about those
stories I told you.

04:44.658 --> 04:46.514
Yeah, I could see how
that'd be a problem.

04:46.514 --> 04:49.191
Exactly. That's why
lily can't find out.

04:49.191 --> 04:50.573
Lily can't find out what?

04:50.573 --> 04:53.182
That marshall's going
to buy her a horse.

04:53.182 --> 04:54.559
You are?

04:54.559 --> 04:55.901
That is so awesome!

04:55.901 --> 04:58.093
I love those things.

04:59.874 --> 05:00.227
Hey, guys, why...

05:00.227 --> 05:02.575
Why is that kid over
there staring at me?

05:04.305 --> 05:06.179
I think I know what this is.

05:06.179 --> 05:08.945
I think it has
finally happened.

05:08.945 --> 05:11.120
I'm getting
recognized fromy show.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.937
Oh, robin, that is so cute.

05:14.937 --> 05:15.781
But that's scotty.

05:15.781 --> 05:18.121
He's one of my students,
and he's looking at me. Oh.

05:18.121 --> 05:20.543
How weird is it that I'm
more famous than you?

05:22.438 --> 05:23.729
I'm on tv.

05:23.729 --> 05:25.428
Yeah, and I have 30
students in my class.

05:25.428 --> 05:27.956
That's what,
30 times your viewership?

05:28.145 --> 05:29.771
Now, this will give
scotty a little thrill--

05:29.771 --> 05:31.955
Buying a drink
for the old prof.

05:33.037 --> 05:34.858
All right, scotter,
one question

05:34.858 --> 05:37.184
About neoclassical
architecture, and that is it.

05:37.184 --> 05:38.662
You're robin
scherbatsky, right?

05:38.662 --> 05:41.115
What? Yes, I am.

05:41.115 --> 05:43.443
Wow. Look,
I-I didn't mean to stare.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.670
It's just, I watch
your show all the time.

05:47.045 --> 05:48.540
Really?

05:48.540 --> 05:49.348
Really?

05:49.348 --> 05:50.712
Totally.

05:51.887 --> 05:53.373
What are you doing
out with ted?

05:53.373 --> 05:55.495
Uh, it's professor mosby.

05:55.495 --> 05:56.731
We're friends.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.434
Holy crap!

05:58.434 --> 06:01.132
Robin scherbatsky is friends
with my econ professor.

06:01.132 --> 06:02.136
It's architecture!

06:02.136 --> 06:03.076
All right,
you know what, scotty?

06:03.076 --> 06:05.065
You're crowding us.
Hit the bricks.

06:06.543 --> 06:07.718
Wait a minute.
You're big fudge.

06:07.718 --> 06:09.225
Go!

06:11.839 --> 06:12.391
Hello?

06:12.391 --> 06:14.303
Hey, baby, I'm on my way up.

06:14.303 --> 06:15.635
What? Why?

06:15.635 --> 06:17.500
There was a measles
outbreak at school,

06:17.500 --> 06:18.950
And they called a half day.

06:18.950 --> 06:21.164
Thought I'd come by here,
have lunch,

06:21.164 --> 06:23.054
Maybe give you the measles.

06:23.054 --> 06:24.490
Okay.

06:24.989 --> 06:27.144
Um, I have a problem.

06:27.144 --> 06:28.592
That was my wife.

06:28.592 --> 06:29.705
When I first mentioned you,

06:29.705 --> 06:31.741
She mistakenly thought
you were a guy, and so...

06:31.741 --> 06:33.201
So, now you're worried
that when she finds out

06:33.201 --> 06:35.430
I'm a woman, she's going
to totally flip out.

06:35.430 --> 06:37.038
Yes. E-exactly.

06:37.038 --> 06:38.531
Oh, geez. Oh, gosh. Okay.

06:38.531 --> 06:39.832
Okay, I was in an improv group

06:39.832 --> 06:42.522
In pelican rapids.
Follow my lead. Okay.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.731
Hey! Hey, baby.

06:45.731 --> 06:47.797
Mmm. Oh, oh, hi.

06:47.797 --> 06:49.389
I'm lily, marshall's wife.

06:50.325 --> 06:51.660
I am from the french embassy.

06:51.660 --> 06:54.321
I am here because of a
small but significant

06:54.321 --> 06:56.095
Cheese incident
that occurred...

06:56.095 --> 06:57.631
She's jenkins!

07:02.342 --> 07:04.216
You're jenkins?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.902
Yeah, well, that, uh,
camembert crisis

07:06.902 --> 07:08.208
Isn't going to resolve itself,

07:08.208 --> 07:10.350
So I'll catch you
guys on the flip-flop.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.701
Marshall cringed.

07:11.701 --> 07:13.402
This was the moment
he had feared.

07:13.402 --> 07:15.001
The famous jenkins!

07:15.001 --> 07:16.328
How about that?

07:16.328 --> 07:18.126
Funny, I was picturing a guy.

07:18.126 --> 07:19.741
Anywho, lunch?

07:20.670 --> 07:21.602
Wait. W-w-w-w-wait.

07:21.602 --> 07:23.682
So... so, you're
not jealous at all?

07:25.763 --> 07:28.494
I never have to worry about
you with another woman.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.492
Right, because we're so
hopelessly in love, right?

07:31.492 --> 07:32.962
Yeah, sure.

07:32.962 --> 07:34.740
Anywho, lunch?

07:36.053 --> 07:37.292
She wasn't jealous at all.

07:37.292 --> 07:38.733
Of course, she wasn't jealous.

07:38.733 --> 07:41.073
That's the whole dynamic
of your relationship.

07:41.527 --> 07:42.468
What's that supposed to mean?

07:42.468 --> 07:44.123
Uh, it's like this, my man.

07:44.123 --> 07:47.461
Every good relationship has
a reacher and a settler.

07:47.461 --> 07:49.540
Exactly. One person reaches

07:49.540 --> 07:50.808
For someone out
of their league;

07:50.808 --> 07:53.864
The other one settles for
someone below theirs.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.287
I did not settle for lily.

07:56.287 --> 07:58.279
Okay, yes,
she's a little short,

07:58.279 --> 08:00.455
And-- true- my mom
says she doesn't have

08:00.455 --> 08:03.173
The hips to birth an
eriksen child, but...

08:04.244 --> 08:05.837
Oh, my god, you guys
think I'm the reacher.

08:05.837 --> 08:07.490
That's why lily's not jealous.

08:07.490 --> 08:10.568
The settler is never jealous
of the reacher because,

08:10.568 --> 08:12.448
Where is the reacher
going to go?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.527
The settler, lily,
is the best thing

08:14.527 --> 08:16.437
That the reacher, marshall,
is ever going to get.

08:16.437 --> 08:17.918
No. No... okay.

08:17.918 --> 08:19.328
Yes, I am lucky to have lily,

08:19.328 --> 08:23.490
But lily is just as lucky...
to have me.

08:23.490 --> 08:25.699
Okay. Neither one of
us is the reacher.

08:25.699 --> 08:27.510
Dude, you are so the reacher.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.844
You're getting her a horse!

08:31.619 --> 08:34.222
What? Shh. Take the hit.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.563
Take the hit.

08:37.438 --> 08:39.039
Thus ending modern
architecture's

08:39.039 --> 08:43.443
Very brief experiment with the
v-frame house.

08:46.377 --> 08:47.748
Excuse me a second.

08:48.561 --> 08:49.330
What are you doing here?

08:49.330 --> 08:51.730
I noticed you forgot
something this morning,

08:51.730 --> 08:53.223
So I thought I'd bring it by.

08:53.339 --> 08:55.379
Your pen. This is your pen.

08:55.379 --> 08:57.886
And you chewed on the
end of it. Recently.

08:57.886 --> 08:59.383
Ah, not a problem, ted.

08:59.383 --> 09:01.370
Your class was on my way
to work. No, it's not.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.514
At come on, get up new york!,

09:03.514 --> 09:04.994
Where I'm an anchor, so...

09:04.994 --> 09:07.659
I watch your show
all the time.

09:08.178 --> 09:09.483
What?!

09:09.483 --> 09:11.934
You watch the show? Oh!

09:11.934 --> 09:14.353
Well, paint me flattered.
Any other fans out there?

09:14.353 --> 09:15.210
Oh, we got... oh.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.224
Okay, all right.
Thanks for coming by, robin.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.204
Oh, well, tune in tonight.

09:18.204 --> 09:21.374
I am doing a great
piece on snail poison.

09:22.569 --> 09:23.528
Also,

09:23.528 --> 09:25.285
Who's got the worst
pizza in new york?

09:25.285 --> 09:26.492
I'll give you the
answer after traffic

09:26.571 --> 09:28.838
On the ones, threes,
fives and nines.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.846
Really?

09:31.846 --> 09:33.407
You guys watch her show?

09:33.407 --> 09:35.295
It's like watching a wel
l-lit aquarium,

09:35.295 --> 09:36.725
But not as interesting.

09:36.725 --> 09:38.910
And now that I think about it,
not as well lit.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.330
Well, the truth is,

09:40.330 --> 09:42.968
We watch it for
the drinking game.

09:42.968 --> 09:44.207
The who now?

09:44.207 --> 09:46.198
Her morning show
comes on so early,

09:46.198 --> 09:48.013
We're usually
still at the bar,

09:48.013 --> 09:49.925
So whenever she
does an interview,

09:49.925 --> 09:53.120
You have to drink every
time she says, "But, um..""

09:54.208 --> 09:55.410
"But, um..."?

09:55.410 --> 09:56.514
"But, um..."

09:56.514 --> 09:58.958
Apparently, she says it a lot.

09:58.958 --> 09:59.841
It's funny.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.937
I had a drinking
game based on robin,

10:01.937 --> 10:03.694
But it was actually on robin.

10:03.694 --> 10:05.353
I'd pour peach schnapps
in her belly button...

10:05.353 --> 10:06.608
Dude, we agreed we
wouldn't do this.

10:06.608 --> 10:08.013
Sorry. You're right.

10:08.013 --> 10:09.762
She didn't like it anyway.

10:09.762 --> 10:11.178
Said it woke her up.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.298
Does she really say "But,
um.."" That much?

10:15.298 --> 10:18.408
That night, we found out
just how much she said it.

10:18.408 --> 10:19.908
Robin : oh, that's great.

10:19.908 --> 10:21.215
But, um... ted: but,
um... barney: nice.

10:21.215 --> 10:22.404
This wasn't your first

10:22.404 --> 10:23.588
Spelling bee, was it?

10:23.588 --> 10:24.708
Nope. Third.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.578
Oh, good for you.

10:26.578 --> 10:28.577
But, um...

10:28.577 --> 10:30.171
But, um...

10:30.171 --> 10:36.058
But, um... but, um...

10:45.398 --> 10:46.646
Hmm.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.382
Interesting article
in the paper.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.926
Says that in every
relationship, there's a
reacher and a settler.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.312
Really? Let me see it.

10:54.312 --> 10:56.381
No, uh, it's not
in this newspaper.

10:56.381 --> 10:57.812
It's in one I
read a while back.

10:57.812 --> 11:00.500
This newspaper reminded
me of the other newspaper.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.783
Anywho...

11:02.783 --> 11:04.374
What do you think about that?

11:04.771 --> 11:07.310
Well, I guess sometimes
that's the case.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.359
But not in ours.

11:09.359 --> 11:11.278
What? No, of course not.

11:11.278 --> 11:13.043
Right.

11:14.528 --> 11:17.997
Well, say-- gun to your head--

11:17.998 --> 11:21.633
You had to say one of
us was the reacher.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.642
Well, I'd say it's neither.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.417
That's what makes us great.

11:26.081 --> 11:29.502
Okay, now there's
a gun to my head

11:29.502 --> 11:32.510
And our future children,
and our future cat or monkey,

11:32.584 --> 11:33.820
Depending on who
wins the game of risk

11:33.820 --> 11:35.435
We've been playing
for three years.

11:35.884 --> 11:36.768
Nope.

11:36.768 --> 11:38.742
No reacher, no settler.

11:38.742 --> 11:41.054
Mmm. Mmm.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.146
Well, how about this?

11:43.146 --> 11:44.753
This went on for a while.

11:46.088 --> 11:47.524
Until finally...

11:48.081 --> 11:49.478
Our two kids,

11:49.478 --> 11:53.322
Our eight grandkids,
our 11 great-grandkids

11:53.322 --> 11:57.311
Are all on a plane
piloted by oprah

11:57.311 --> 12:00.074
And it's about to crash
into an art museum

12:00.074 --> 12:01.630
With all of your
favorite paintings,

12:01.630 --> 12:04.422
And the only way... the
only way to save everything

12:04.422 --> 12:06.506
Is just... is just to
answer the question:

12:06.506 --> 12:09.620
Are you the reacher
or the settler?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.405
And oprah's tried everything?

12:12.405 --> 12:13.558
Everything!

12:13.558 --> 12:16.074
You have to decide now.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.323
Well, I guess,
if I had to say,

12:20.324 --> 12:22.474
Then maybe I'd say

12:22.474 --> 12:23.162
I'm the settler.

12:23.162 --> 12:25.263
How could you say that?!

12:25.444 --> 12:27.979
She thinks that
she's the settler.

12:28.746 --> 12:29.622
I mean, that's it.

12:29.622 --> 12:32.862
I gotta-I gotta prove to her
that I am not the reacher.

12:32.862 --> 12:34.335
I gotta make her jealous.

12:34.335 --> 12:35.705
Well, that's easy.
Here's the plan.

12:35.705 --> 12:38.017
*Sleep with jenkins.

12:38.017 --> 12:40.252
*I sleep with jenkins first.

12:40.252 --> 12:42.291
*We do step two first.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.196
I'm gonna go get
started on step two.

12:46.017 --> 12:47.934
Okay, okay, I got something.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.754
Remember the other night,
the skee-ball game?

12:49.755 --> 12:51.656
When you were putting nothing
but wood in the 50 hole?

12:51.657 --> 12:52.336
Whatever.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.525
Just another night
for big fudge.

13:17.813 --> 13:19.200
You thought she was into me?

13:19.200 --> 13:21.535
Full-on lady wood.

13:21.536 --> 13:23.103
Yes.

13:23.104 --> 13:25.306
Of course.

13:25.307 --> 13:27.308
A plan taketh shape.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.893
If lady lily's jealousy

13:29.893 --> 13:33.248
Young marshall cannot budge,

13:33.249 --> 13:37.619
Then perchance,
fair gentles, big fudge...

13:37.620 --> 13:39.221
Can...

13:39.222 --> 13:40.227
Make her jealous.

13:40.227 --> 13:41.522
Okay, let me try that again.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.246
If lady lily's...
I got it, buddy.

13:43.246 --> 13:44.870
I got it.

13:46.622 --> 13:50.084
Ted, I have got a great idea.

13:50.084 --> 13:51.133
Oh, is it "clean your hair

13:51.133 --> 13:52.817
"out of the shower drain
when you're done"?

13:52.817 --> 13:55.427
Seriously, it's like you're
trying to carpet the tub.

13:55.427 --> 13:58.801
If you wanted to print out
one of your lectures or
something,

13:58.801 --> 14:00.628
I could read it on air.

14:00.628 --> 14:03.581
Coming from a more
entertaining source,

14:03.963 --> 14:06.630
Your students might actually
pay attention and learn
something.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.834
Oh, you're entertaining?

14:08.834 --> 14:10.751
Last night, there was
three minutes of dead air

14:10.751 --> 14:13.211
While you sewed a button
back on your sweater.

14:13.211 --> 14:16.198
Look, just because your class
likes me more than you...

14:16.198 --> 14:18.772
You're a drinking game! What?

14:18.772 --> 14:19.886
That's why they watch.

14:19.886 --> 14:21.109
They made a drinking
game out of you.

14:21.109 --> 14:24.429
Every time you say "But,
um..."" They do a shot.

14:24.429 --> 14:26.456
"But, um..."? Yeah.

14:26.456 --> 14:28.110
I don't say, "But, um..."

14:28.110 --> 14:29.835
I've never said, "But, um..."

14:29.835 --> 14:31.951
Well, then, I guess it's not
a very good drinking game.

14:31.951 --> 14:33.934
Which would mean last night,
when barney and I played it,

14:33.934 --> 14:37.411
I didn't get super wasted and
throw up all over myself.

14:37.411 --> 14:40.736
Oh, wait, I did both
of those things.

14:40.736 --> 14:43.485
So, face.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.635
Hey, jenkins. Hey, buddy.

14:47.635 --> 14:49.746
Hey, so, um,

14:49.746 --> 14:52.811
Lily and I are gonna go back
to that college bar again.

14:52.811 --> 14:55.140
And, uh, we were wondering
if maybe you wanted to come.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.601
Uh, you could just, like,
watch me play skee-ball

14:57.601 --> 14:59.763
Or do exactly what you
did the other night.

14:59.763 --> 15:00.842
Something like that.

15:00.842 --> 15:03.418
It's really up to you.
I mean, I know that...

15:19.958 --> 15:21.941
Hey, baby,
what are you doing home?

15:22.852 --> 15:24.092
"Baby."

15:24.092 --> 15:26.970
That's... that's a
name I don't deserve.

15:26.970 --> 15:28.151
What?

15:28.151 --> 15:30.090
Jenkins kissed me.

15:30.090 --> 15:31.547
She kissed me.

15:31.547 --> 15:34.434
The other day,
she saw me play skee-ball,

15:34.434 --> 15:35.505
And I don't know, I guess

15:35.505 --> 15:37.941
She caught some of
the big fudge fever.

15:37.941 --> 15:39.003
But you have to know

15:39.003 --> 15:40.896
I stopped it right away.

15:40.896 --> 15:44.357
And just, you're the
only one for me, baby.

15:46.006 --> 15:48.107
Oh, I see what this is.

15:48.107 --> 15:51.409
This is about the whole
reacher/settler thing.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.996
Come again for big fudge?

15:52.996 --> 15:54.466
You want to make me jealous,

15:54.466 --> 15:56.949
So you're making up a
story about jenkins.

15:56.949 --> 15:59.165
I'm not making this up!

15:59.165 --> 16:00.097
This happened.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.591
That woman kissed
me with tongue.

16:02.591 --> 16:04.610
Her-her tongue
was in my mouth.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.458
Sure it was.

16:06.458 --> 16:09.638
It was thick and rough
like a starfish arm.

16:09.638 --> 16:12.042
Oh, I'm so jealous.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.810
I'm just gonna go over there
and punch her right in the
nose.

16:14.810 --> 16:17.455
Give her a knuckle sandwich.

16:17.455 --> 16:20.274
Come on, baby.
You want some soup?

16:21.659 --> 16:23.638
It happened!

16:24.093 --> 16:26.407
Do you have any...

16:26.407 --> 16:28.595
Split pea left?

16:29.650 --> 16:31.738
These are just a few of
the many contributions

16:31.738 --> 16:33.968
He made to
architecture and yet

16:33.968 --> 16:36.464
He is only remembered
for one thing.

16:36.464 --> 16:39.209
That my friends,
is the sad legacy

16:39.209 --> 16:43.269
Of gregorio franchetti gazebo.

16:44.359 --> 16:45.752
Any questions?

16:45.752 --> 16:47.792
Hey, do you want to go out
drinking with us tonight?

16:47.792 --> 16:48.492
What?

16:48.492 --> 16:49.403
Yeah, we're gonna play

16:49.403 --> 16:51.390
The robin scherbatsky
drinking game.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.468
We were wondering if
you wanted to join us.

16:53.468 --> 16:59.002
Well, what can I say except "
But, ums up."

17:00.841 --> 17:02.553
Can I still come?

17:03.196 --> 17:05.184
I'll pay. Nice.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

17:05.185 --> 17:06.551
Okay.

17:06.553 --> 17:10.521
So, your third book was your
breakout novel but, um...

17:10.521 --> 17:12.381
But, um...!

17:12.381 --> 17:14.277
Damn!

17:14.277 --> 17:15.708
Sorry.

17:15.708 --> 17:19.704
But-- just "But" No "Um,
" Just "But."

17:19.704 --> 17:23.005
Your first novel was
written more quickly.

17:23.005 --> 17:24.006
That's correct.

17:24.006 --> 17:26.473
But, um... all: but, um...!

17:27.628 --> 17:29.533
How great is this?!

17:31.000 --> 17:33.525
And it was right then
that robin got an idea

17:33.525 --> 17:35.846
That would end the
drinking game forever.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.481
I wanted to ask you about

17:37.481 --> 17:39.532
The novel you're
writing right now.

17:39.532 --> 17:41.179
But, um... all: but, um...!

17:41.179 --> 17:43.809
...it's an idea you've
had for a, but, um...

17:43.809 --> 17:44.866
But, um...!

17:44.866 --> 17:45.553
...long time, but, um...?

17:45.553 --> 17:47.328
But, um...!

17:48.187 --> 17:48.979
No... no, no, no.

17:48.979 --> 17:50.744
Don't drink, it's a trap!

17:50.744 --> 17:51.963
I think I'm gonna go.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.457
You can keep your ten bucks.

17:53.457 --> 17:56.175
Okay, but, um,
thanks for being with us.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.616
But, um, if there's any
college kids watching,

17:58.616 --> 18:01.610
But, um, but, um, but,
um, but, um, but, um,

18:01.610 --> 18:03.656
We have to drink, professor.

18:03.656 --> 18:07.507
It's the rules.
She said "But, um"

18:09.788 --> 18:12.515
But, um, but, um, but,
um... god help us all.

18:14.182 --> 18:15.773
Here you are.

18:15.773 --> 18:18.595
I'm so sorry I
kissed you yesterday.

18:18.595 --> 18:19.428
That's okay.

18:19.428 --> 18:22.220
And I'm sorry I had sex
with you in the mailroom.

18:22.220 --> 18:23.257
That wasn't me.

18:23.257 --> 18:24.365
Oh, good grief, that's two

18:24.365 --> 18:26.779
Awkward conversations
I have to have today.

18:26.942 --> 18:28.670
I don't normally do that.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.519
I-I was really drunk.

18:30.519 --> 18:32.217
You were drunk at 8:
00 in the morning?

18:32.217 --> 18:34.117
Yeah, I don't know
how that happened.

18:34.117 --> 18:36.668
Robin : I thought snail
pellets were safe, but, um...

18:36.668 --> 18:38.477
But, um...!

18:42.719 --> 18:44.742
I gotta get to work.

18:46.505 --> 18:48.525
Man, that game is
really catching on.

18:48.525 --> 18:50.202
Damn it, how could I do this?

18:50.202 --> 18:51.264
It's okay.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.067
No, you know what,
it's not okay.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.103
You're the nicest guy
in this stupid office

18:55.103 --> 18:57.729
And I really don't want to
screw up our friendship.

18:58.121 --> 18:59.113
This is so embarrassing.

18:59.113 --> 19:00.884
Please don't tell anyone.

19:00.884 --> 19:02.703
No, who am I gonna tell?

19:02.703 --> 19:04.007
Lily?

19:04.007 --> 19:05.405
I told lily.

19:05.472 --> 19:07.434
Oh, for pete's sake, well,
I gotta go talk to her.

19:07.434 --> 19:08.498
I gotta apologize.

19:08.498 --> 19:10.092
No! No! Don't... yes.

19:10.092 --> 19:12.617
Marshall, I'm just gonna
tell her that it happened,

19:12.617 --> 19:14.524
That it meant nothing
and that I'm sorry.

19:14.524 --> 19:16.170
No, I...

19:17.914 --> 19:19.393
Yes.

19:19.781 --> 19:22.569
Yes. Do that.

19:22.569 --> 19:23.287
I will.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.069
Yeah, and if you don't
have time for all that,

19:25.069 --> 19:28.209
Just tell her it happened,
and that you're sorry.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.092
And if you're in a real rush,

19:29.092 --> 19:30.343
you don't even have to say,
"I'm sorry""

19:30.343 --> 19:31.817
Just tell her
that it happened.

19:31.817 --> 19:34.575
That's the important part,
that it actually happened.

19:34.575 --> 19:37.914
So emphasize that
as much as you can.

19:38.383 --> 19:39.366
And so, lily, I guess

19:39.366 --> 19:41.655
What I'm saying is,
it happened.

19:41.655 --> 19:45.027
I feel terrible about it,
and I'm really sorry.

19:45.027 --> 19:48.252
Well... it happened.

19:48.252 --> 19:49.909
What are you going to do?

19:49.909 --> 19:51.143
It happened.

19:51.143 --> 19:54.447
Terrible! But like I said...

19:54.447 --> 19:55.403
It happened.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.770
Exactly, and I feel
awful about it.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.836
And I'd hate myself
if what I did

19:58.836 --> 20:02.448
Hurt you in any way or
affected your relationship
with marshall.

20:02.448 --> 20:03.727
Please forgive me.

20:04.826 --> 20:06.158
Kiss my husband?!

20:06.158 --> 20:08.077
My husband?! Nobody kisses

20:08.077 --> 20:10.370
My future baby daddy but me!

20:12.805 --> 20:14.041
Marshall, you're
blocking the shot!

20:14.041 --> 20:15.210
Well, I...

20:15.210 --> 20:16.698
And, kids, your uncle marshall

20:16.698 --> 20:19.015
Never tried to make
lily jealous again.

20:19.015 --> 20:20.639
That's good.

20:26.761 --> 20:31.456
Okay, we're just going to
have a nice, low-key class
today.

20:31.456 --> 20:33.184
Not a lot of talking.

20:34.288 --> 20:36.648
No loud noises.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.527
'sup guys?

20:40.527 --> 20:43.566
No, no, no, no.
Please, just... just go away.

20:43.566 --> 20:46.648
I just wanted to
drop by and say...

20:48.245 --> 20:49.722
Thanks for watching

20:49.722 --> 20:52.114
Come on, get up new york!

20:52.114 --> 20:54.415
Whoo!

20:58.458 --> 21:00.346
But, um...!
