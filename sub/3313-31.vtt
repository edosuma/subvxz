WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:09.629
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.630 --> 00:12.302
SO IN SUMMARY, YOU NEED
TO APPROVE THE LOAN

00:12.303 --> 00:13.723
FOR LONGO FIT VIRTUAL GYM

00:13.724 --> 00:14.934
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
IN BETTER SHAPE

00:14.935 --> 00:16.936
THAN ITS OWNER, IS
ITS PROFIT MARGIN.

00:16.937 --> 00:18.728
OH, GREAT JOB.

00:18.729 --> 00:20.140
REALLY, YOU'RE SURE?
IT WASN'T TOO LONG?

00:20.141 --> 00:21.141
IT DIDN'T FEEL TOO SHORT?

00:21.142 --> 00:23.103
JOE, IT'S FINE.

00:23.104 --> 00:26.736
HONEY, FINE IS FOR LOSERS.

00:26.737 --> 00:28.818
I MEAN, I NEED IT TO
BE PERFECT, ALL RIGHT?

00:28.819 --> 00:29.909
'CAUSE THE SOONER
I GET THIS LOAN,

00:29.910 --> 00:31.491
THE SOONER I CAN LAUNCH
THIS VIRTUAL GYM

00:31.492 --> 00:32.952
AND GET LONGO FIT OUT
THERE, EVERYWHERE.

00:32.953 --> 00:35.916
YOU KNOW, WORLDWIDE. MAYBE...
MAYBE EVEN BEYOND.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.419
LOOK, THE BANK WOULD
BE CRAZY TO SAY NO.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.040
ONLINE ONE-ON-ONE
TRAINING SESSIONS?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.922
THAT'S SOMETHING I
WOULD DO EVERY DAY.

00:42.923 --> 00:44.164
WELL, EVERY OTHER DAY.

00:44.165 --> 00:46.045
OKAY, ONCE A WEEK. I'M
A VERY BUSY WOMAN.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.048
ANYWAY, YOU LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU NEED HELP WITH.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.931
THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE
VERY SPECIFIC THING

00:51.932 --> 00:54.134
THAT YOU COULD DO FOR ME.

00:54.135 --> 00:56.976
YEAH, WELL YOU KNOW I'M
ALWAYS UP FOR THAT.

00:56.977 --> 00:58.638
LEAVE ME ALONE FOR
THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

00:58.639 --> 00:59.939
WHAT?

00:59.940 --> 01:01.771
JOE LONGO DOESN'T
WANT TO HAVE SEX?

01:01.772 --> 01:05.024
YEAH, HONEY. I'M LIKE A
BOXER BEFORE A BIG FIGHT.

01:05.025 --> 01:09.239
I REALLY NEED TO
CONSERVE MY ESSENCE.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.901
ALL RIGHT, THAT JUST MEANS I DON'T HAVE
TO SHAVE MY LEGS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

01:11.902 --> 01:15.034
( cheering ) I SHALL
RUN AND LET THE WIND

01:15.035 --> 01:17.367
BLOW THROUGH MY LEG HAIR.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.658
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUN.

01:18.659 --> 01:19.790
NAH, NOT A CHANCE.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.662
( theme music playing )

01:22.663 --> 01:25.665
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:25.666 --> 01:29.550
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:32.052 --> 01:33.303
OH, RYDER, HEY.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN

01:33.304 --> 01:34.674
YOU BROUGHT HOME
THAT BAD MATH TEST

01:34.675 --> 01:35.845
AND I BIT YOUR HEAD OFF.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.179
IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE
OVER 28 DAYS AGO...

01:39.180 --> 01:41.221
YEAH, YOU MEAN THAT TIME YOU
GOT IRRATIONALLY ANGRY,

01:41.222 --> 01:45.685
AND CRIED, AND THREW
CHOCOLATE AT ME.

01:45.686 --> 01:47.857
I WAS AIMING FOR YOUR MOUTH.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.989
BUT, YEAH, THAT'S THE DAY.

01:49.990 --> 01:51.321
CAN YOU CHECK YOUR CALENDAR?

01:51.322 --> 01:52.782
I NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT DATE

01:52.783 --> 01:55.034
BECAUSE I USUALLY PUT IT IN
MY CALENDAR LIKE EVERY MONTH.

01:55.035 --> 01:56.616
I DON'T HAVE A TEST EVERY MONTH.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.448
JUST TELL ME.

01:58.449 --> 02:00.330
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. UH, HERE IT IS.

02:00.331 --> 02:01.741
I BROUGHT HOME THE TEST
ON THE FOURTEENTH.

02:01.742 --> 02:02.792
SO THAT WAS, WHAT?

02:02.793 --> 02:03.913
SIX WEEKS AGO.

02:03.914 --> 02:05.915
WHAT? NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:05.916 --> 02:08.248
THAT MEANS IT'S BEEN SIX
WEEKS SINCE MY LAST PERIOD.

02:08.249 --> 02:11.382
YOUR PERIOD, YOU'RE
GRADING PERIOD.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.014
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO WORRIED

02:15.015 --> 02:17.467
ABOUT MY GRADES, AUNT MEL, OKAY?
I GOT ANOTHER TEST THIS WEEK

02:17.468 --> 02:18.928
AND I'M GONNA DO BETTER.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

02:18.929 --> 02:19.929
IF I GET ANOTHER "C."

02:19.930 --> 02:21.060
WHAT HAPPENS?

02:21.061 --> 02:22.972
( chuckling ) OH, VERY FUNNY.

02:22.973 --> 02:25.144
YEAH, LIKE WHO COULD FORGET
A PUNISHMENT LIKE THAT.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.147
OH, I DIDN'T FORGET, YOU KNOW.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.729
SO YOU LIVE IN FEAR OF THAT,

02:29.730 --> 02:33.072
EXACT PUNISHMENT, THAT
IS SO AWFUL THAT I...

02:33.073 --> 02:35.905
I JUST CAN'T SAY IT OUT LOUD...

02:35.906 --> 02:36.906
YOU CAN.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.328
SEE?

02:38.329 --> 02:41.412
SEE, YOU CAN'T. IT'S THAT AWFUL.

02:51.842 --> 02:53.634
( alarm ringing )

02:57.848 --> 02:59.099
OH, BOY.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.146
PRESTON, MY MAN.

03:07.147 --> 03:10.149
MY BRILLIANT,
MATH-UNDERSTANDING MAN.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.441
WHAT'S UP?

03:11.442 --> 03:13.653
RYDER, WHY COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE SPEAKING TO ME

03:13.654 --> 03:14.734
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER?

03:14.735 --> 03:16.696
( laughing ) THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.947
HEY, LISTEN, UM...

03:17.948 --> 03:22.822
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

03:22.823 --> 03:24.414
I NEED TO GET A "B"
ON MY NEXT TRIG TEST.

03:24.415 --> 03:27.627
OR MY AUNT WON'T LET ME GO TO THE
SENIOR TRIP TO WASHINGTON D.C.

03:27.628 --> 03:30.089
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD. THE D.C.
TRIP IS REPUTED TO BE

03:30.090 --> 03:31.751
THE HIGHLIGHT OF SENIOR YEAR.

03:31.752 --> 03:33.963
STUDENTS RUNNING WILD,
SKINNY DIPPING IN THE POOL,

03:33.964 --> 03:36.045
JUMPING ON HOTEL BEDS...

03:36.046 --> 03:37.757
IF THAT KIND OF THING
APPEALS TO YOU.

03:37.758 --> 03:40.179
OH, IT DOES. WHICH IS
WHY I NEED YOUR HELP.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.052
I THINK IF YOU PREP ME FOR
THE TEST, I CAN GET A "B."

03:43.053 --> 03:45.395
HMM...

03:45.396 --> 03:47.397
I'LL DO IT ON ONE CONDITION.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.018
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH...

03:49.019 --> 03:50.060
LAYLA PETERSON, RIGHT?

03:51.692 --> 03:53.232
MAKE HER LIKE ME.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.616
( nervous laughter )
THAT'S A TALL ORDER.

03:56.617 --> 04:00.490
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY...
WHAT'S THE WORD?

04:00.491 --> 04:04.203
WHAT GIRLS ARE INTERESTED IN.

04:04.204 --> 04:07.127
BUT, IF YOU WANT TO
RUN WILD IN D.C...

04:08.709 --> 04:09.790
OKAY, COME ON.

04:11.081 --> 04:12.131
( clears throat ) LAYLA, HEY...

04:12.132 --> 04:14.964
NOT NOW, RYDER. I'M
TRYING TO STUDY.

04:14.965 --> 04:17.046
IF I FAIL ANOTHER TRIG TEST,
MY PARENTS ARE GONNA KILL ME.

04:17.047 --> 04:19.048
YOU'RE IN LUCK.
BECAUSE PRESTON HERE

04:19.049 --> 04:20.260
IS A MATH GENIUS.

04:21.642 --> 04:24.594
HE IS LIKE THE EINSTEIN
OF BEING SMART...

04:24.595 --> 04:27.266
SO, LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN OUR STUDY GROUP?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.018
YOU WOULD BE EMBRACED.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.730
IN OUR GROUP, NOT BY ME.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.101
IN MY ARMS.

04:32.102 --> 04:34.273
BELIEVE ME, IF YOU CAN
HELP ME PASS TRIG

04:34.274 --> 04:36.025
I'LL BE THE ONE EMBRACING YOU.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.107
( nervous laughter )

04:38.108 --> 04:41.201
TAKE IT EASY, DUDE. YOU'RE
STEAMING UP YOUR GLASSES.

04:46.617 --> 04:49.168
HEY, JOE, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

04:49.169 --> 04:51.120
YEAH, I COULD ACTUALLY
USE A WORK BREAK ANYWAY.

04:51.121 --> 04:52.332
WHAT'S UP?

04:52.333 --> 04:56.085
UH, WELL, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

04:56.086 --> 04:59.128
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE A DINNER PARTY.

04:59.129 --> 05:00.299
AND YOU KNOW WHO
WE SHOULD INVITE?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.382
YOUR FRIEND DEREK, AND
HIS GIRLFRIEND LISA

05:02.383 --> 05:03.924
THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY
GOT PREGNANT, WHOOPS.

05:05.976 --> 05:07.597
THAT WORKED OUT FOR THEM, RIGHT?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.929
DEREK IS HAPPIER NOW THAN
HE HAS BEEN IN YEARS, HUH?

05:09.930 --> 05:12.141
YES, GOOD FOR THEM.

05:12.142 --> 05:13.272
YEAH, ANOTHER HAPPY COUPLE.

05:13.273 --> 05:15.144
OH NO, HE'S NOT
WITH LISA ANYMORE.

05:15.145 --> 05:17.026
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
SAID HE WAS HAPPY?

05:17.027 --> 05:19.899
YEAH, BECAUSE NOW HE'S DATING
A 23-YEAR-OLD LINGERIE MODEL.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.701
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO LISA?

05:21.702 --> 05:23.403
YOU KNOW, HONEY, THEY RUSHED
INTO GETTING MARRIED,

05:23.404 --> 05:25.495
AND THEN BABY CAME ALONG, AND THAT
EVEN PUT MORE PRESSURE ON 'EM,

05:25.496 --> 05:27.537
AND THEN THEY GOT DIVORCED. THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES.

05:27.538 --> 05:29.620
CAP IT BEFORE YOU TAP IT?

05:33.003 --> 05:35.164
NO. NO, HONEY.

05:35.165 --> 05:37.336
NO, FIRST COMES LOVE,
THEN COMES MARRIAGE,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.459
THEN COMES DEREK WITH
A BABY CARRIAGE.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.171
WORDS TO LIVE BY.

05:42.763 --> 05:44.514
ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT
EVERYTHING DEREK WENT THROUGH

05:44.515 --> 05:46.135
MAKES ME REALIZE THAT THE
PROBLEMS I'M DEALING WITH

05:46.136 --> 05:47.346
ARE NOT REALLY THAT BIG A DEAL.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.519
HM.

05:50.731 --> 05:51.852
GLAD I COULD HELP.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.607
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.569
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

05:59.570 --> 06:01.110
I SCRATCHED MY CAR.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.902
IT'S JUST A LITTLE ONE.
BUT THE THING IS,

06:02.903 --> 06:04.744
WHEN I GOT MY CAR,
JOE GUARANTEED ME

06:04.745 --> 06:06.946
THAT I'D HAVE AN
ACCIDENT WITHIN A WEEK.

06:06.947 --> 06:09.288
OH, WELL YOU SHOWED HIM.
IT'S BEEN, WHAT, 10 DAYS?

06:09.289 --> 06:13.122
DO WE HAVE TO TELL HIM
ABOUT THE SCRATCH?

06:13.123 --> 06:16.085
LOOK, YOU LUCKED OUT. JOE IS
ON THE 48-HOUR NO BOTHER LIST

06:16.086 --> 06:17.757
WHILE HE GETS READY FOR
HIS LOAN PRESENTATIONS.

06:17.758 --> 06:19.999
SO, YOU GET YOUR CAR FIXED BY
THEN AND I WON'T TELL HIM.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.210
SERIOUSLY?

06:21.211 --> 06:22.592
COOL, THANKS, AUNT MEL.

06:22.593 --> 06:24.003
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL TAKE
MY CAR TO THE BODY SHOP

06:24.004 --> 06:25.716
TOMORROW BEFORE ZANDER
COMES OVER TO WORK.

06:26.967 --> 06:28.928
HE'S BEEN HERE A LOT, LATELY.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.269
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'RE
COLLABORATING,

06:30.270 --> 06:31.971
BUT ARE YOU COLLABORATING?

06:31.972 --> 06:35.725
NO, WE ARE JUST PLATONIC FRIENDS
AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE.

06:35.726 --> 06:36.776
IT'S WHAT WE BOTH WANT.

06:36.777 --> 06:39.109
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

06:49.199 --> 06:50.660
HM, HUH...

06:50.661 --> 06:54.874
YOU KNOW, IT TURNS OUT I
JUST REALLY DON'T WANT WINE.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.958
WHAT? YOU, NOT WANTING WINE?
WHAT, ARE YOU PREGNANT?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.130
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE PREGNANT!

07:01.131 --> 07:03.252
SHH, I HAVEN'T TOLD JOE YET.

07:03.253 --> 07:04.924
OKAY, AND HE'S VERY TRADITIONAL.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.926
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW THIS
WILL AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.888
HE MIGHT NOTICE IF
YOU PUT ON 50 POUNDS

07:08.889 --> 07:10.890
AND THEN A PERSON
POPS OUT OF YOU.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.642
OKAY, I'M GOING TO SEE
THE DOCTOR TOMORROW,

07:12.643 --> 07:14.554
TAKE ANOTHER TEST AND
FIND OUT WHEN I'M DUE.

07:14.555 --> 07:15.935
AND THEN, AFTER
JOE'S PRESENTATION

07:15.936 --> 07:18.227
I WILL FIND THE PERFECT
WAY TO TELL HIM.

07:18.228 --> 07:20.480
BUT UNTIL THEN, YOU DO NOT TELL
A SINGLE PERSON, UNDERSTOOD?

07:20.481 --> 07:22.692
OKAY, LOOK, AS LONG AS YOU
DON'T TELL HIM ABOUT MY CAR

07:22.693 --> 07:24.524
YOU COULD BE SQUIRTING MILK
FROM HERE TO CLEVELAND

07:24.525 --> 07:26.235
AND I STILL WOULDN'T
SAY A THING.

07:26.236 --> 07:31.201
OKAY, WAY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY
SUPPORT AND TRAUMATIZE ME.

07:35.786 --> 07:37.707
LONGO, YOU CAN DO
BETTER THAN THIS.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.499
HEY, JOE. HOW'S YOUR
PROPOSAL GOING?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.961
( growls )

07:41.962 --> 07:43.883
I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK BEAR.

07:43.884 --> 07:46.676
OKAY, SERIOUSLY, AM
I THE ONLY PERSON

07:46.677 --> 07:47.757
WHO EVER EMPTIES THIS THING?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.510
YES, YOU ARE. THANKS, JOE.

07:51.091 --> 07:52.552
UGH...

07:52.553 --> 07:54.223
WILL YOU GRAB ME
ANOTHER BAG, PLEASE?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.935
YEAH.

07:55.936 --> 07:58.728
HEY, WHAT THE...

07:58.729 --> 08:00.019
WHO IN THIS HOUSE TOOK
A PREGNANCY TEST?

08:00.020 --> 08:01.020
UH... ME.

08:01.021 --> 08:05.484
LENNOX, THIS IS POSITIVE.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.027
OH, YEAH, THAT'S NOT MINE.

08:08.448 --> 08:09.448
YOU JUST SAID IT WAS.

08:09.449 --> 08:12.953
WELL... YEAH.

08:14.454 --> 08:15.615
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

08:15.616 --> 08:19.789
IF THAT IS MY TEST,
THEN I HAVE TO SAY,

08:19.790 --> 08:22.042
YES I AM.

08:27.968 --> 08:29.178
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

08:29.179 --> 08:30.509
THIS IS HOW WE FIND OUT
THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.592
OKAY, JOE, DON'T WORRY.

08:32.593 --> 08:35.094
I GUARANTEE YOU YOU WILL HAVE A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK

08:35.095 --> 08:36.686
ON THIS IN LIKE 48 HOURS.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.729
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT TIME HEALS, LENNOX.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.851
WHO'S THE FATHER, HUH?

08:41.852 --> 08:43.943
WHAT IS IT, THAT EMERSON PUNK?

08:43.944 --> 08:46.105
UGH, GROSS, I WOULDN'T EVEN
PRETEND TO BE HAVING HIS BABY.

08:46.106 --> 08:48.528
WELL, IF IT'S NOT EMERSON
THEN IT'S GOTTA BE...

08:50.530 --> 08:51.702
ZANDER...

08:52.783 --> 08:54.413
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

08:54.414 --> 08:56.616
I NEVER BOUGHT THIS WHOLE
PLATONIC FRIENDS ACT

08:56.617 --> 08:57.997
YOU TWO HAD GOING ON,
ANYONE CAN SEE YOU GUYS

08:57.998 --> 08:59.458
ARE STILL CRAZY
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

08:59.459 --> 09:00.580
WE ARE NOT.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.121
OH, SAYS THE MOTHER
OF HIS LOVE CHILD.

09:02.122 --> 09:04.543
OKAY, OKAY, JOE. JUST
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.085
FOCUS ON WHAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW,

09:06.086 --> 09:07.546
YOUR LOAN PRESENTATION.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.879
YEAH, SURE, OKAY. 'CAUSE
AS LONG AS WE GOT MONEY

09:09.880 --> 09:11.220
WHO CARES HOW MANY
PREGNANT TEENAGERS

09:11.221 --> 09:12.221
ARE RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.674
SEE, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.732
SO, WHEN AM I DUE?

09:22.733 --> 09:23.943
BECAUSE I'D LIKE SOME TIME

09:23.944 --> 09:25.444
BEFORE I HAVE TO BREAK THE
NEWS TO MY BOYFRIEND.

09:25.445 --> 09:28.398
LIKE, THREE OR FOUR
YEARS SHOULD DO IT.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.901
WELL, THEN I HAVE
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.322
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.365
I'M NOT PREGNANT? BUT, WHAT
ABOUT THE HOME TEST I TOOK?

09:36.366 --> 09:38.908
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD
THAT TEST MIGHT HAVE BEEN?

09:38.909 --> 09:41.370
WELL, IT WAS IN A BOX OF STUFF
MY FRIEND HEATHER GAVE ME

09:41.371 --> 09:43.162
WHEN SHE LEFT TO BECOME A
COLOR ME BADD GROUPIE.

09:43.163 --> 09:45.875
SO, NOT BRAND NEW.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.297
WELL, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.
EXPIRED PREGNANCY TESTS

09:48.298 --> 09:50.259
CAN SOMETIMES GIVE
A FALSE POSITIVE.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.590
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY
MONTHLY VISITOR?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.342
SHE HASN'T STOPPED BY IN WEEKS.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.215
HAS THERE BEEN ANY CHANGE
TO YOUR REGULAR ROUTINE?

09:56.216 --> 09:57.556
ANYTHING STRESSFUL?

09:57.557 --> 10:00.099
NOT REALLY, JUST DOING
THE USUAL HIGH-SPEED,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.220
MODERN DANCE WOMAN DOES.

10:01.221 --> 10:03.482
YOU KNOW... RAISING
KIDS, DOING HER JOB,

10:03.483 --> 10:05.604
TRYING TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,
LEANING IN, SUCKING UP...

10:05.605 --> 10:07.527
SOMETIMES I DO FALL ASLEEP
AT RED LIGHTS, THOUGH.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.780
I MIGHT BE A LITTLE
STRESSED OUT.

10:10.781 --> 10:13.863
WELL, NOW YOU HAVE ONE
LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.035
GREAT, I'M NOT PREGNANT.

10:16.036 --> 10:18.659
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.581
I MIGHT HAVE MIXED
EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.375
IN A SCALENE RIGHT-ANGLE TRIGON,

10:26.376 --> 10:29.048
THE TANGENT OF 65° IS
EQUAL TO EIGHT OVER FIVE.

10:29.049 --> 10:31.250
FIND THE SLOPE OF
THE HYPOTENUSE.

10:31.251 --> 10:32.592
ARE YOU JUST MAKING
THIS STUFF UP?

10:33.714 --> 10:36.756
ISN'T A SLOPE LIKE A HILL?

10:36.757 --> 10:39.929
COME ON, GUYS.
THIS IS NOT TOUGH.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.310
OKAY, OKAY, I GOT THIS.

10:41.311 --> 10:43.352
SAY THE PART ABOUT
THE HILL AGAIN.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.144
( laughing )

10:45.145 --> 10:47.436
IT'S NOT A HILL, IT'S A SLOPE.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.608
OH, RELAX. HE'S JUST KIDDING.

10:49.609 --> 10:50.770
CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE?

10:50.771 --> 10:52.692
RYDER, YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.984
NO, YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

10:55.615 --> 10:57.366
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING ME LOOK COOL.

10:57.367 --> 10:58.778
- YEAH.
- DO YOU WANT TO GO TO D.C. OR NOT?

10:58.779 --> 11:01.120
OKAY, I'M GETTING THERE.
ALL RIGHT?

11:01.121 --> 11:04.413
UH, LAYLA? YOU KNOW
WHAT'S MORE IMPRESSIVE

11:04.414 --> 11:05.544
THAN BEING FUNNY?

11:05.545 --> 11:06.956
BEING SMART.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.207
AND PRESTON HERE,

11:08.208 --> 11:09.668
GOT A PERFECT SCORE
ON HIS S.A.T.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.631
AND EARLY ACCEPTANCE TO BROWN.

11:12.632 --> 11:13.964
THE COLOR?

11:15.425 --> 11:16.595
NO, NO, IT'S A SCHOOL.

11:16.596 --> 11:18.849
- OH.
- RIGHT?

11:21.852 --> 11:24.223
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

11:24.224 --> 11:26.686
DUDE, I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

11:31.651 --> 11:33.863
WELL, WELL, WELL...

11:33.864 --> 11:36.276
LOOK WHO DECIDED TO SHOW UP
TO MY HOUSE, VOLUNTARILY.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.578
THIS MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY.

11:39.579 --> 11:40.990
HEY, JOE...

11:40.991 --> 11:42.451
DON'T "HEY, JOE" ME, PAL.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.702
YOU AND I NEED TO
HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.875
SURE, CAN I PLUG
MY PHONE IN FIRST?

11:45.876 --> 11:47.667
I FORGOT TO CHARGE
IT LAST NIGHT.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.131
HOW COULD YOU AND LENNOX
BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE?

11:52.132 --> 11:53.543
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST A PHONE.

11:54.674 --> 11:56.836
SHE IS PREGNANT WITH
YOUR CHILD, MAN.

11:56.837 --> 11:58.637
WHAT?

11:58.638 --> 12:01.010
"WHAT," DON'T PLAY DUMB,
ALL RIGHT, SHE TOLD ME.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.512
OKAY, WELL THAT WOULD...

12:03.513 --> 12:05.344
THAT WOULD MAKE HER LIKE...

12:05.345 --> 12:07.016
YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T LOOK
EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.558
QUIT PLAYING YOUR GAMES, ZANDER.
YOU'RE THE FATHER, PERIOD.

12:09.559 --> 12:11.690
ALL RIGHT, AS MUCH AS I
CAN'T STAND THIS FACT,

12:11.691 --> 12:13.692
YOU ARE NOW GONNA BE
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE

12:13.693 --> 12:15.064
FOR TAKING CARE OF
LENNOX AND THAT BABY.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.857
SO SHE'S REALLY PREGNANT?

12:19.319 --> 12:20.409
THIS, UH...

12:20.410 --> 12:22.701
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
OH, MY GOD!

12:22.702 --> 12:24.663
HEY, LOOK. CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

12:24.664 --> 12:26.745
I MAY HAVE JUST COME DOWN A
LITTLE HARD ON YOU OVER THERE.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.037
THE POINT IS, WE'RE
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

12:28.038 --> 12:31.581
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DO.

12:33.673 --> 12:35.465
COME HERE, SON.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.507
- ARE YOU GOOD?
- I'M ALL GOOD.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.509
GREAT.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.721
LOOK, PREGNANCIES...

12:42.722 --> 12:44.594
( voice quivering ) THEY CAN
BRING OUT A LOT OF EMOTIONS.

12:46.686 --> 12:47.726
YEAH, THEY CAN.

12:47.727 --> 12:49.889
BUT THE POINT IS...

12:49.890 --> 12:50.890
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

12:50.891 --> 12:51.892
I UNDERSTAND.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.104
( phone beeping )

12:57.107 --> 13:01.530
"ZANDER, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GO TO MY HOUSE, 9-1-1."

13:01.531 --> 13:02.993
( laughing ) NO FREAKING
KIDDING, LENNOX.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.038
( phone ringing )

13:10.170 --> 13:11.710
LENNOX?

13:11.711 --> 13:14.463
HEY, AUNT MEL. LISTEN, THEY'RE
SAYING THAT THIS PAINT JOB

13:14.464 --> 13:16.715
IS GONNA BE $600. ARE
THEY RIPPING ME OFF?

13:16.716 --> 13:18.968
OH, HONEY, THAT'S WHAT THEY
DO TO US BEAUTIFUL BLONDES.

13:18.969 --> 13:20.679
BUT YOU STAND FIRM
LIKE A MATURE WOMAN,

13:20.680 --> 13:23.222
AND CRY UNTIL THEY
LOWER THE PRICE.

13:23.223 --> 13:27.516
WOW, THAT IS SO OFFENSIVE. AND
TOTALLY BRILLIANT, THANKS.

13:27.517 --> 13:30.099
OH YEAH, AND THERE'S ONE
OTHER THING YOU SHOULD KNOW,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.892
( power drill whirring )

13:32.893 --> 13:34.693
HONEY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

13:34.694 --> 13:35.695
( whirring continues )

13:37.067 --> 13:38.697
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST...
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

13:38.698 --> 13:40.359
BYE.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.072
HEY, WE NEED TO TALK.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.364
OH, I CAN'T RIGHT NOW, JOE. I
JUST STOPPED BY TO PICK UP

13:45.365 --> 13:47.156
MY NOTES FOR MY AFTERNOON
MEETING WITH THE MAYOR.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.618
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:49.619 --> 13:50.870
YOU DO?

13:50.871 --> 13:54.793
YEP, I FOUND OUT ABOUT
LENNOX'S LITTLE ACCIDENT.

13:54.794 --> 13:58.008
OH RIGHT, LENNOX'S ACCIDENT.

13:59.799 --> 14:02.381
SO YOU KNEW? WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

14:02.382 --> 14:03.512
WELL, YOU WERE BUSY.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.634
AND FRANKLY, WE THOUGHT
YOU'D OVERREACT.

14:05.635 --> 14:07.636
OVERREACT?

14:07.637 --> 14:10.599
IF ANYTHING, I'M UNDERREACTING.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.231
I CAN ASSURE YOU, YOU'RE NOT.

14:12.232 --> 14:13.772
HONEY, SHE WAS COMPLETELY
IRRESPONSIBLE.

14:13.773 --> 14:14.974
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ZANDER.

14:14.975 --> 14:16.735
WELL, WHY WOULD SHE?
THEY'RE NOT A COUPLE.

14:16.736 --> 14:17.898
WAIT, WAS HE THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

14:19.399 --> 14:21.740
I'M PRETTY SURE HE WAS, YEAH.

14:21.741 --> 14:23.072
AND HE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.

14:23.073 --> 14:25.484
OKAY, LOOK, IT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

14:25.485 --> 14:27.696
THEY'RE TEENAGERS, THIS KIND OF
THING HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME.

14:27.697 --> 14:29.039
IT HAPPENED TO ME
WHEN I WAS HER AGE.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.291
WHAT?!

14:32.292 --> 14:33.372
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.753
WELL, WHAT'S TO TELL?

14:34.754 --> 14:36.125
SOME GUY PULLED OUT
IN FRONT OF ME,

14:36.126 --> 14:37.707
TRIED TO STOP, IT
WAS JUST TOO LATE.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.594
I DIDN'T NEED THE PICTURE!

14:45.595 --> 14:47.806
LOOK, JOE, JUST RELAX, OKAY?

14:47.807 --> 14:49.138
LENNOX AND I WILL HANDLE
THIS WHILE YOU TAKE CARE

14:49.139 --> 14:51.390
OF WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,
YOUR LOAN APPLICATION.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.142
HOW COULD YOU EVEN BE THINKING OF
SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.563
DO YOU NOT HAVE ANY
PRIORITIES AT ALL?

14:54.564 --> 14:56.225
COURSE I DO, WHICH IS WHY I
HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

14:56.226 --> 14:57.776
ALL RIGHT, FINE, YOU DON'T WANT
TO HANDLE THIS WHOLE THING

14:57.777 --> 14:59.438
WITH LENNOX, NO PROBLEM.
I'LL HANDLE IT.

14:59.439 --> 15:01.860
FINE, BUT GO EASY ON HER.
JUST HAVE HER EXPLAIN

15:01.861 --> 15:03.612
EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED,
AND THEN SHOW HER

15:03.613 --> 15:06.655
SOME MANEUVERS TO AVOID
THE SITUATION NEXT TIME.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.736
BYE, HONEY.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.910
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

15:17.457 --> 15:20.039
OKAY, I'VE EXPLAINED
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.840
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
FINISH THIS PROBLEM

15:21.841 --> 15:24.754
IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO
GET MYSELF A NON-DAIRY BEVERAGE.

15:26.386 --> 15:27.466
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

15:27.467 --> 15:31.430
SO THE IMAGINARY
NUMBER "I" IS...

15:31.431 --> 15:34.683
OH, MY GOD. I'M ACTUALLY
STARTING TO GET THIS.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.145
ALL RIGHT, SO ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT...

15:36.146 --> 15:39.108
THIS IS BORING, CAN WE
TAKE A STUDY BREAK?

15:39.109 --> 15:42.061
LAYLA, IF I DON'T GET THIS, THEN
I CAN'T GO ON THE TRIP TO D.C.

15:42.062 --> 15:43.522
SO, DO WE HAVE THE ANSWER?

15:43.523 --> 15:45.365
YEAH, ALMOST.

15:52.372 --> 15:53.453
TO HELL WITH D.C.

15:55.285 --> 15:56.285
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

15:56.286 --> 15:57.456
THAT'S IT.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.168
WHEN I'M WITH THE
REST OF THE SENIORS

15:59.169 --> 16:00.419
SITTING ON ABRAHAM
LINCOLN'S LAP,

16:00.420 --> 16:02.881
YOU'LL REGRET THIS, RYDER.

16:02.882 --> 16:05.635
YEAH, I DON'T THINK I WILL.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.049
OH, GREAT. HEY,
LISTEN TO ME, MAN.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.090
WORD TO THE WISE...

16:11.091 --> 16:12.392
DON'T EVER HAVE SEX.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.014
THANKS, JOE.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.395
YEAH, LOOK, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:16.396 --> 16:17.976
YOUR SISTER GOT HERSELF INTO
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE,

16:17.977 --> 16:20.269
AND NO ONE HERE WANTS TO HANDLE
IT, SO I'M GONNA HANDLE IT.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.771
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BUMP?

16:24.364 --> 16:25.524
YOU KNEW, TOO?

16:25.525 --> 16:27.906
YEAH, SHE WAS ACTING
ALL WEIRD THIS MORNING

16:27.907 --> 16:30.409
WHEN I ASKED HER FOR A RIDE,
SO SHE FINALLY CAME CLEAN

16:30.410 --> 16:31.740
AND SHOWED ME THE
PHOTOS ON HER PHONE.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.703
IT'S PRETTY UGLY.

16:34.704 --> 16:36.575
HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

16:36.576 --> 16:39.118
IT'S STILL PART OF THIS FAMILY.

16:39.119 --> 16:40.460
AND WE WILL LOVE IT.

16:45.585 --> 16:46.885
OH, MY GOD, ZANDER.

16:46.886 --> 16:48.587
LOOK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, OKAY?
JUST LISTEN.

16:48.588 --> 16:49.678
I'VE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT

16:49.679 --> 16:50.719
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT,

16:50.720 --> 16:52.091
AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT MINE,

16:52.092 --> 16:53.222
SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT IT'S EMERSON'S...

16:53.223 --> 16:54.303
WHOA, OKAY. ZANDER, NO...

16:54.304 --> 16:55.634
JUST LET ME FINISH, OKAY?

16:55.635 --> 16:57.015
I KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST
SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS NOW.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.138
AND...

16:59.139 --> 17:01.400
YOU JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

17:01.401 --> 17:04.693
OKAY? 'CAUSE YOU HAVE ME.

17:04.694 --> 17:05.905
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ME.

17:07.647 --> 17:09.448
YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME
EVEN IF I'M PREGNANT

17:09.449 --> 17:10.490
WITH EMERSON'S BABY?

17:12.362 --> 17:13.362
YEAH, I DO.

17:13.363 --> 17:16.415
YOU ARE AMAZING.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.538
KIND OF CRAZY, BUT
MOSTLY AMAZING.

17:22.662 --> 17:24.084
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

17:26.005 --> 17:27.427
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.719
YOU'RE NOT?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.381
MM-MM.

17:32.382 --> 17:33.592
IS THAT A DEAL BREAKER?

17:33.593 --> 17:35.435
I THINK I'LL FIND SOME
WAY TO GET OVER IT.

17:42.642 --> 17:44.853
WHOA, WHAT'S ALL THAT?

17:44.854 --> 17:46.895
THIS IS ME TAKING YOUR
PREGNANCY SERIOUSLY.

17:46.896 --> 17:49.148
BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS TO. HERE.

17:49.149 --> 17:52.782
"WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE
UNEXPECTEDLY EXPECTING."

17:54.324 --> 17:55.654
OPRAH LOVES THAT ONE.

17:55.655 --> 17:59.538
OKAY, JOE, LOOK. I KNOW
WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

17:59.539 --> 18:02.291
BUT THE TRUTH IS I WAS COVERING.

18:02.292 --> 18:03.542
THAT PREGNANCY TEST WASN'T MINE.

18:03.543 --> 18:05.874
SO, YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?

18:05.875 --> 18:06.915
NO.

18:06.916 --> 18:09.758
OH, THANK GOD. THAT'S AWESOME.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.670
BECAUSE I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR A BABY...

18:11.671 --> 18:14.473
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT,
WHOSE TEST WAS THAT?

18:14.474 --> 18:15.515
UH...

18:18.348 --> 18:21.521
THAT WAS... THAT WAS MEL'S?
MEL IS PREGNANT?

18:24.724 --> 18:26.396
I'M GONNA BE A FATHER.

18:29.319 --> 18:30.899
I'M GONNA BE A FATHER.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.363
I HEAR OPRAH LOVES THIS ONE.

18:41.581 --> 18:45.414
WELL, IF EVER THERE WAS A
DAY THAT I DESERVE THIS,

18:45.415 --> 18:46.456
IT'S TODAY.

18:49.879 --> 18:50.960
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

18:52.091 --> 18:53.212
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

18:53.213 --> 18:54.253
NO NO NO NO NO

18:54.254 --> 18:55.425
NO NO NO NO NO.

18:57.056 --> 18:58.056
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

18:58.057 --> 18:59.057
TELL YOU WHAT?

18:59.058 --> 19:00.639
THAT I'M GONNA BE A FATHER.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.352
OH, BOY.

19:03.723 --> 19:04.764
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

19:12.982 --> 19:13.982
IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S?

19:13.983 --> 19:16.235
NO, LISTEN, JOE.

19:16.236 --> 19:19.578
I TOOK A PREGNANCY TEST, BUT
IT WAS A FALSE POSITIVE.

19:19.579 --> 19:21.370
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

19:21.371 --> 19:23.372
OH.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.123
( sighs )

19:25.124 --> 19:27.496
I GOTTA TELL YOU, HONEY.
THAT IS A RELIEF.

19:27.497 --> 19:29.087
IT IS?

19:29.088 --> 19:32.501
YEAH, YEAH, 'CAUSE I'M NOT
REALLY READY FOR A BABY.

19:32.502 --> 19:37.005
NOT THIS WEEK. THIS HAS
REALLY BEEN A BAD WEEK.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.597
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME WHAT WAS GOING ON?

19:38.598 --> 19:40.599
WELL, BECAUSE YOU WERE BUSY
WITH YOUR PRESENTATION

19:40.600 --> 19:42.180
AND THEN WE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND DEREK,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.353
AND HOW AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY
RUINED HIS RELATIONSHIP.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.565
AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU AND ME.

19:46.566 --> 19:48.437
IT WOULDN'T HAVE.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.568
WE AREN'T THEM.

19:49.569 --> 19:51.730
SO, IF I HAD BEEN PREGNANT?

19:51.731 --> 19:55.275
I WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST
GUY IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

19:59.279 --> 20:01.820
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE TOLD
YOU AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.493
LIKE WITH LENNOX
SCRATCHING HER CAR.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.166
SHE SCRATCHED HER CAR?

20:08.167 --> 20:11.540
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO OVERREACT, ARE YOU?

20:11.541 --> 20:15.003
AFTER WHAT I'VE
BEEN THROUGH TODAY?

20:15.004 --> 20:16.095
NO FREAKING WAY.

20:18.047 --> 20:19.339
NO PROMISES ABOUT
TOMORROW, THOUGH.

20:24.013 --> 20:25.103
HEY, HONEY.

20:25.104 --> 20:27.015
HEY, SO HOW'D THE MEETING GO?

20:27.016 --> 20:28.016
BANK OFFICER LOVED IT.

20:28.017 --> 20:29.227
GREAT!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.440
YEAH, UNTIL SHE LOOKED
ME UP ONLINE AND SAW

20:31.441 --> 20:34.062
THAT I USED TO WORK FOR SCANLON.
TURNS OUT THAT SCANLON

20:34.063 --> 20:36.485
STOLE HER FATHER'S
ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.116
SO, SHE DIDN'T
GIVE YOU THE LOAN?

20:38.117 --> 20:40.118
SHE TRIED TO HIT
ME WITH A STAPLER.

20:40.119 --> 20:42.120
JOE, I'M SO SORRY.

20:42.121 --> 20:43.742
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I WAS
ACTUALLY JUST HAPPY

20:43.743 --> 20:44.994
THAT SHE COULDN'T LIFE
THE COPY MACHINE.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.245
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, THOUGH.
YOU KNOW WHY?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.077
BECAUSE I HAVE AN
UNBEATABLE PRODUCT.

20:49.078 --> 20:50.168
AND AMAZING GOOD LOOKS.

20:50.169 --> 20:51.130
WELL, I WASN'T GONNA SAY THAT.

20:51.131 --> 20:53.211
YES, YOU WERE.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.294
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.505
HEY, GUYS.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.926
AH-AH, HEY, DIDN'T YOU GET

20:57.927 --> 20:58.967
YOUR MATH TEST BACK TODAY?

20:58.968 --> 21:00.679
YEAH.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.641
ANOTHER "C"? RYDER!

21:02.642 --> 21:04.383
ALRIGHT, GO AHEAD.
MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.685
GIVE ME THE PUNISHMENT
YOU PROMISED.

21:06.686 --> 21:09.227
YEAH, THE PUNISHMENT I PROMISED.

21:09.228 --> 21:11.189
I HEREBY GIVE YOU...

21:11.190 --> 21:12.561
THAT.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.944
EH, IT WAS WORTH IT.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.067
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT PUNISHMENT

21:19.068 --> 21:20.108
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, DO YOU?

21:20.109 --> 21:21.360
NOT A CLUE.

21:21.361 --> 21:23.031
UNTIL WE HAVE KIDS OF OUR OWN,

21:23.032 --> 21:24.242
IT'S KIND OF NICE TO
HAVE THESE OTHER ONES

21:24.243 --> 21:25.615
TO MAKE MISTAKES ON.
