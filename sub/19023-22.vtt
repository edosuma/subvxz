00:02.166 --> 00:04.667
You ever notice how a tumor looks
just like cheese?

00:04.750 --> 00:06.834
Is that good cocktail
conversation?

00:06.917 --> 00:08.291
I had this patient today

00:08.375 --> 00:09.750
who thought he had
blood in his stool.

00:09.834 --> 00:12.291
It turned out
to be pimento.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.792
-Unh.
-(J.D.) What?

00:14.875 --> 00:15.959
I worked on
a homeless guy

00:16.041 --> 00:17.667
who vomited up
an entire mitten.

00:17.750 --> 00:18.750
I mean, that's not
gonna stop me

00:18.834 --> 00:20.041
from wearing mine
when it's cold out.

00:20.125 --> 00:21.750
What is wrong
with you people?

00:21.834 --> 00:23.083
We have a good
bottle of wine.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.333
We all look nice
for once.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.709
Can we please talk
about something other than work?

00:26.792 --> 00:27.750
Please?

00:29.500 --> 00:30.875
Name an actress.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.417
J.D. Could tell you which movie
she appeared in naked.

00:34.125 --> 00:36.250
I'm gonna go
put on my pajamas.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.667
Can't believe I shaved
my legs for this.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.166
Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan,
and Jennifer Connelly.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.125
<i>Boys On The Side, The Doors,</i>
and as for Ms. Connelly,

00:44.208 --> 00:45.667
topless in <i>Inventing The Abbots,</i>

00:45.750 --> 00:47.333
bottomless in <i>Requiem For a Dream,</i>

00:47.417 --> 00:49.750
and in <i>The Hot Spot,</i>
<i>You Gotta Love Her,</i>

00:49.834 --> 00:52.542
frontal and tush-tush.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.041
(Carla) Oh, my God.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.250
Yeah.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.166
(J.D.) <i>That's the thing</i>
<i>about best friends.</i>

00:58.083 --> 00:59.333
<i>They just get each other.</i>

00:59.417 --> 01:03.417
You usually get uncomfortable
hugging a guy right about now.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.250
Bring it, baby.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.792
This is not gonna end well for you.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.875
I used to wrestle in college.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.583
(laughs)

01:10.667 --> 01:13.083
Oh. You broke the hug.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.375
-(laughs)
-So you working on a house or what?

01:15.458 --> 01:18.500
Yeah, I scored this
big restoration job.

01:20.125 --> 01:21.709
So who's the, uh, fan club?

01:21.792 --> 01:22.959
Neat hug.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.750
Newbie, no one likes
a looky-loo.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.291
Not now. Not ever.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.792
So what? Is that, like,
your lucky board or something?

01:29.875 --> 01:32.166
Oh, that?
Oh, it's a nail gun accident.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.250
Oh, my God,
that's disgusting.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.583
I already dosed him with morphine,

01:35.667 --> 01:37.542
and the X-ray says the nail went
straight through,

01:37.625 --> 01:39.166
so it's not that big a d--

01:39.250 --> 01:41.166
Oh, dear God,
she's getting woozy.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.041
Quickly, show her
the bloody side.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.834
-Look at that.
-Touch the nail.

01:44.917 --> 01:47.667
You wanna touch it?
Touch the nail. Touch my nail!

01:47.750 --> 01:49.875
Touch it! Lick the tip of my--

01:49.959 --> 01:51.583
(Dr. Cox) Good night.

01:51.667 --> 01:54.000
Well, let's get you
to a hand surgeon.

01:54.083 --> 01:55.333
What about the tough guy?

01:55.417 --> 01:57.500
Somebody will get her.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.625
Bye-bye.

02:01.917 --> 02:05.417
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:08.333
<i>♪ No, I know, I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:12.125 --> 02:13.750
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:15.542 --> 02:17.458
I can't get over it.
I mean, who faints anymore?

02:17.542 --> 02:18.750
No one's fainted
since the forties.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.333
Well, it's okay.
You're just a doctor.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.083
You shouldn't have to look
at stuff like that.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.333
I was surprised.
I don't like surprises.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.041
Oh, my goodness!

02:27.375 --> 02:30.083
Pictures capture
moments in time.

02:30.166 --> 02:31.542
Ooh.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.583
When they're posed,
they're not real.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.333
You know, I hate that whole,
like, "eeh" thing.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.500
That's why at a party,

02:37.583 --> 02:39.709
you see me in the bushes
with my camera.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.250
You're a little weird,
aren't you?

02:41.333 --> 02:42.583
Just a little bit.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.917
Hey, Ben, look what
the cat tried to drag in

02:45.000 --> 02:47.583
right before it was
skinned and eaten.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.166
You're still with
the annoying camera?

02:50.250 --> 02:52.291
Did she just skip
the whole part

02:52.375 --> 02:53.834
where people say hello
to each other?

02:53.917 --> 02:57.000
Hello, Benji.
You look very pale.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.417
I miss the sweet talk.
(laughs)

02:59.500 --> 03:00.875
Maybe it's been too long.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.834
Maybe my feelings
were hurt a little bit.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.917
Feelings. That's a good one.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.458
Jordan, you're a big girl now.

03:06.542 --> 03:07.458
When you got the divorce,

03:07.542 --> 03:08.875
you put people
in the awkward position

03:08.959 --> 03:11.250
of having to choose between
you and Perry.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.166
You're my brother.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.166
Well, admittedly,
that made it harder.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.291
Ooh, good one.

03:17.375 --> 03:20.375
(High-pitched voice)
Me so cranky. Ooh.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.542
The patient's name
is Mo Weinberg.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.875
Cancer is confined
to the right testicle.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.375
Dr. Turk will be assisting
with the removal.

03:28.458 --> 03:33.083
Sorry, Mo. Looks like you're about
to lose either Larry or curly.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.417
Starting the incision.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.625
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

03:36.709 --> 03:38.959
I'm guessing
Mr. Weinberg is Jewish.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.083
Yeah, so?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.625
Why isn't he circumcised?

03:43.834 --> 03:45.125
(J.D.) <i>A recent medical study found</i>

03:45.208 --> 03:48.125
<i>that a mistake is made</i>
<i>on about 20% of all patients.</i>

03:48.208 --> 03:50.083
<i>Most of these are clerical</i>
<i>and harmless,</i>

03:50.166 --> 03:52.792
<i>but it still adds up</i>
<i>to a lot of near misses.</i>

03:52.875 --> 03:55.166
Dr. Wen wants me to ask you
if there could be a mix-up

03:55.250 --> 03:58.959
because our appendicitis patient,
that dude doesn't have an appendix.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.792
Wait right here.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.083
-Wow.
-I know. You know, we almost did--

04:06.166 --> 04:09.750
Whoa! What's goin' on here?

04:11.041 --> 04:15.000
No, mom. I don't care what
my third grade teacher is up to.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.959
Mm-hmm.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.291
Uh-huh.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.959
Uh, and scene.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.417
-How are you?
-How are you?

04:21.500 --> 04:22.875
I haven't seen you
since your breakdown.

04:22.959 --> 04:25.000
Oh. (laughs)
Which one?

04:25.083 --> 04:26.500
(Both laugh)

04:26.583 --> 04:28.750
Oh. Oh.

04:28.834 --> 04:31.333
So... What's new?

04:31.417 --> 04:33.583
Well, the last time I saw you,
I was really stressed out.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.291
You know, the weight
of the world on my shoulders...

04:36.375 --> 04:37.875
-So guess what I did?
-Quit your job.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.125
Flushed my fish
down the toilet.

04:39.208 --> 04:42.041
No more feedings.
No more cleaning the bowl.

04:42.125 --> 04:44.458
No more being judged
for having a second glass of wine.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.583
Oh, don't even get me started
on judgmental fish.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.208
Mm-hmm, but then that sent me
into this whole shame spiral

04:49.291 --> 04:51.041
so I decided to travel.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.375
I got hit on in Venice.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.166
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro
for about 10 minutes.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.500
It's very, very steep,

04:56.583 --> 04:57.750
and then I went to Florida

04:57.834 --> 04:59.667
to swim with the dolphins...

04:59.750 --> 05:00.875
And I don't mean the fish.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.500
There was an NFL thing
going on at the hotel.

05:02.583 --> 05:03.875
(Both laugh)

05:03.959 --> 05:06.125
-You.
-Oh, I almost forgot. I'm engaged!

05:06.208 --> 05:08.250
-(screams)
-Oh, right. There used to be a ring there,

05:08.333 --> 05:10.333
but then my fiance did
some soul searching,

05:10.417 --> 05:14.083
and we decided that it needed
to be a little more fancy.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.959
Oh, you have no idea
how happy this makes me.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.625
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you.

05:17.709 --> 05:20.542
The only reason you're vomiting
and exhausted is...

05:20.625 --> 05:22.458
Well, you're pregnant.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.291
I'm what now?

05:25.375 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, pregnant!
Your fiance's gonna be so happy!

05:28.083 --> 05:32.000
My fiance and I decided not to have sex
until we were married.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.917
So he's not gonna be so happy.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.709
More curious, really, than happy.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.125
So you're gonna wanna
rewrap the gauze when it gets soiled.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.792
Wow, rewrap a dirty bandage.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.250
It's phenomenal
how you doctors

05:44.333 --> 05:45.625
keep all this stuff
in your head.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.542
You know, we don't.
It says it right there on the box.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.250
Yeah, see?
Look right there.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.333
Hey, don't be mean to him.
You're mad at me.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.917
Yeah, because you shouldn't
be doing contracting work.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.667
You are clumsy. That's why things
like this keep happening.

05:55.750 --> 05:56.792
They don't keep happening.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.458
How many times have you hurt yourself
with that nail gun?

05:59.542 --> 06:00.959
-Once.
-Oh, come on.

06:01.041 --> 06:03.291
What? With that nail gun?
It's a new nail gun.

06:03.375 --> 06:04.834
If it had been any other nail gun,
then, yeah.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.500
The estimate would
be slightly higher.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.542
(laughs)

06:07.625 --> 06:08.625
It's not funny.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.375
You're pretty
when you're mad.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.875
(J.D.) <i>I guess sibling rivalry</i>
<i>never goes away</i>

06:12.959 --> 06:14.375
<i>no matter how old you get.</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:17.166
What is this?
That didn't hurt.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.750
Didn't hurt. Didn't hurt.

06:19.834 --> 06:21.458
(whistles)

06:23.000 --> 06:25.333
Okay, that kinda smarts
a little bit.

06:29.792 --> 06:30.875
(blows out flames)

06:30.959 --> 06:32.458
Jordan, I'll call you later, all right?

06:32.542 --> 06:35.875
Okay, fine.
Forget it. Forget it.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.458
You big jerk.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.166
You happen to remember
when she used to be fun?

06:40.250 --> 06:41.250
-No.
-Me, neither.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.625
-Me, neither.
-(whistle)

06:42.709 --> 06:46.083
When spoken to, newbie.
When spoken to.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.834
Here, I thought
we were clear on that one.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.583
Hey, Ben, you realize

06:49.667 --> 06:52.417
we haven't grabbed a beer
in a couple of weeks. What's that about?

06:52.500 --> 06:54.959
(J.D.) <i>You know, he's never asked me</i>
<i>to grab a beer, but I don't care.</i>

06:55.041 --> 06:57.083
Newbie, would ya
like to come?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.291
Oh, God, yes.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.458
To buddies!

07:00.542 --> 07:02.458
What in the hell do you think
you're doing?

07:02.542 --> 07:04.375
You can't drink beer.
You're our driver.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.000
That's why we brought you
to begin with.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.750
That's just not right.

07:07.834 --> 07:10.291
No, I'm gonna drink this
for both of us.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.333
I can't stop thinkin'
about Mr. Weinberg's testicles.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.375
Dude.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.625
I mean, I almost removed
one of them, Todd.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.083
-Which one?
-Like it matters.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.208
Oh, it matters.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.458
Bye, Todd.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.000
Okay.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.959
Dr. Turk, I heard
about your mishap earlier today,

07:31.041 --> 07:32.458
but here's the skinny.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.458
If that patient finds out
what happened

07:34.542 --> 07:36.250
because you can't
rein in your yapper,

07:36.333 --> 07:38.083
then heads are going to roll,

07:38.166 --> 07:41.709
and I promise you, yours and Ted's will be
the first to go.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.667
What did I do?

07:43.750 --> 07:45.458
Consider my lips sewn shut, sir...

07:45.542 --> 07:47.458
Which in this hospital could
actually happen.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.125
Young man...

07:49.208 --> 07:53.500
At sacred heart,
we do not make mistakes.

07:53.583 --> 07:57.375
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no...

07:57.458 --> 08:00.125
Tim, sweetie, I wouldn't have slept
with someone else

08:00.208 --> 08:01.792
if I didn't love you so much.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.000
No, no, no, no, no! Stop!

08:04.083 --> 08:05.375
Hang up the phone!

08:05.458 --> 08:08.417
Hold on one second. Hold on!

08:08.500 --> 08:09.417
Hi!

08:09.500 --> 08:10.959
Your last name is Tracy!

08:11.041 --> 08:12.667
Of course, you know
your last name is Tracy,

08:12.750 --> 08:14.291
but what you don't know
is there's a woman down in 308

08:14.375 --> 08:15.417
whose first name is Tracy.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.125
So I started thinking
about your urine sample

08:17.208 --> 08:18.583
and how you always carry
that water bottle with you

08:18.667 --> 08:19.542
and stay very well hydrated.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.333
Which is why your pee is a much
lighter color than most people's pee,

08:22.417 --> 08:24.500
and then I remember the sample that
came back with your name on it.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.375
It was bright yellow,
and the other Tracy, well,

08:26.458 --> 08:27.583
she is not much of a water drinker

08:27.667 --> 08:29.750
which is why I think
her skin looks so pasty.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.667
Okay, sweetie, I'm gonna need you
to get to the point.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.208
You're not pregnant!

08:33.291 --> 08:35.583
The lab tech just
switched the samples.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.083
You're killin' me.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.709
Hey, sweetie, you know I was just jokin'
about all that stuff, right?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.417
Kim Basinger.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.208
Please. <i>9 1/2 Weeks.</i>

08:48.291 --> 08:49.792
Winona Ryder.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.375
Never naked,
but just a hint of nipple

08:52.458 --> 08:53.959
in <i>How to make an American Quilt.</i>

08:54.041 --> 08:55.083
Oh, you're good.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.125
At last, a worthy foe.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.625
Oh, chalk boy.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.000
Gladys, if you could chalk it
without pleasuring it,

09:04.083 --> 09:05.125
that would be terrific.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.125
(laughs)

09:07.208 --> 09:08.667
What?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.125
I know you're going
for the gruff doctor routine,

09:11.208 --> 09:14.166
but it just comes off sounding
like a cartoon pirate.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.375
(imitates pirate)
Argh, Gladys!

09:16.458 --> 09:19.458
Chalk it, don't pleasure it! Argh!

09:19.542 --> 09:21.542
(imitates pirate) Here's what we're
gonna do, newbie. We're gonna--

09:21.625 --> 09:24.291
Are ya done?
Yeah, I'm--I'm done.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.333
(whining)
I think you are, too.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.000
Come on.
Let him have a little fun.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.625
(Dr. Cox)
All right, Clara.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.959
You can go ahead
and order yourself a Cosmopolitan.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.959
We'll all just grab a cab home.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.959
Actually, Ben has been
sneaking me beers all night,

09:38.041 --> 09:39.500
and I'm quite drunk.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.750
That's just great.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.709
Ah.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.583
Hey, Ben, what--

09:45.667 --> 09:47.291
why is this hand still bleeding?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.333
(Ben) I don't know.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.875
It's really weird, 'cause I cut myself
shaving last week,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.542
and it wouldn't stop bleeding.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.041
(J.D.) <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that sucks about being a doctor</i>

09:57.125 --> 09:59.000
<i>is that you never miss</i>
<i>a red flag.</i>

09:59.667 --> 10:02.083
Put your hand over here
for 2 seconds. Just...

10:02.166 --> 10:03.333
What the hell are you doing to me?

10:03.417 --> 10:05.458
Just humor me. It's probably mono, anyway.

10:05.542 --> 10:06.959
Isn't that
the kissing disease?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.083
-Yeah.
-Score.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.500
Your only job today
is to get his test results back.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.625
You understand?

10:12.709 --> 10:13.709
Hey, guys.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.417
(Ben) See? Now that's real.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.667
So it turns out she wasn't really
pregnant after all

10:19.750 --> 10:21.500
'cause some idiot
mislabeled her urine sample.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.834
I was a heartbeat away from giving
an appendix patient a crotch lobotomy.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.208
If I do my best
and I lose a patient,

10:27.291 --> 10:29.041
you know what?
I can live with that,

10:29.125 --> 10:30.583
but if a clerical error
is the reason why

10:30.667 --> 10:33.000
a guy's walkin' around here
with only the lonely...

10:33.083 --> 10:35.542
That don't sit well
with the big dog.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.750
(pager beeps)

10:37.834 --> 10:39.083
I'm with you, big dog.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.834
(J.D.) <i>I was paged because</i>
<i>Ben's blood work was finally ready.</i>

10:42.917 --> 10:45.333
<i>Unfortunately, the chart</i>
<i>wasn't in the outbox.</i>

10:45.417 --> 10:47.291
<i>I'd knock, but the hematopathologist</i>

10:47.375 --> 10:50.500
<i>is the meanest intern-hating-est monster</i>
<i>in this hospital.</i>

10:50.583 --> 10:51.625
Don't be a chicken.

10:51.709 --> 10:54.542
If you need something,
just go in and get it.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.375
(Doug) Uh, excuse me, sir--

10:57.458 --> 11:01.583
(hematopathologist roars)

11:01.667 --> 11:04.250
I'll come back later.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.291
(J.D.) <i>The truth is,</i>
<i>the hematopathologist</i>

11:06.375 --> 11:08.917
<i>was the last person in this hospital</i>
<i>I wanted to deal with.</i>

11:09.000 --> 11:10.041
Oh!

11:10.125 --> 11:12.125
Why do you have to jump out
and scare me all the time?!

11:12.208 --> 11:14.834
I don't jump out and scare you.

11:14.917 --> 11:17.667
I follow you around all day.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.667
I've only got about an hour-and-a-half
worth of work around here,

11:19.750 --> 11:22.417
and the rest of the time,
I track you like an animal.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.250
You're kidding, right?

11:24.333 --> 11:29.125
Ha ha ha. I don't know. Am I?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.583
Hmm.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.083
(J.D.) <i>What?</i>

11:35.166 --> 11:36.542
<i>How did that get there?</i>

11:37.959 --> 11:39.625
<i>Come on, good news.</i>

11:39.709 --> 11:40.750
(Carla) Hey, Bambi.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.125
Are you okay?

11:46.333 --> 11:47.542
(J.D.) <i>Leukemia.</i>

11:49.291 --> 11:50.458
No.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.375
(J.D.) <i>When you have to deliver</i>
<i>horrible news to someone,</i>

11:58.458 --> 12:01.000
<i>the walk to their door</i>

12:02.000 --> 12:03.750
Thank you, nice nurse.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.583
(Chuckles)
Ben. Why?

12:06.667 --> 12:08.750
'Cause it's my thing.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.333
You're just jealous.
You don't have a thing.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.583
I had a thing.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.750
I used to like to hike,

12:13.834 --> 12:17.041
but Jordan somehow
got that in the divorce, too.

12:17.125 --> 12:21.333
She got your hobby.
That's vindictive. Ooh.

12:21.417 --> 12:24.083
Look, Ben, I know I am
prone to making

12:24.166 --> 12:25.959
the occasional
casual reference

12:26.041 --> 12:29.166
to your sister
being a, well,

12:29.250 --> 12:31.417
a wire-haired, man-goblin...

12:31.500 --> 12:32.917
(Laughs)
But I hope that

12:33.000 --> 12:35.208
has no effect on your
relationship with her.

12:35.291 --> 12:36.917
It's really very sweet of you

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
to think that
you're that important.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.500
-Draw on 3.
-Oh, yeah.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.875
1, 2, 3, draw.

12:43.875 --> 12:47.166
Oh, you are
in serious trouble.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.625
Hey, new friend.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.083
Oh, Janice.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.125
Are those the test results
we've been waiting for?

12:54.208 --> 12:57.542
(J.D.) <i>Wait a sec.</i>
<i>First turk's patient, then Elliott's.</i>

12:57.625 --> 13:00.792
<i>This is a mistake.</i>
<i>I feel it in my gut. I'm sure of it.</i>

13:00.875 --> 13:02.625
Hello. Janice.

13:02.709 --> 13:05.041
Uh, no. This is something...

13:05.125 --> 13:07.500
You know, that lab
is backed up again

13:07.583 --> 13:10.166
and so I'm gonna have,
it's, you know, a little while.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.208
All right. Terrific to see ya.
Good-bye.

13:13.291 --> 13:14.625
(Turk) Yeah, I know
who screwed this up.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.458
It's that same lazy-ass
admitting nurse

13:16.542 --> 13:19.375
that mixed up my files,
and there she is. I'm gonna go get her.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.458
Turk, I can fight
my own battles, man.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.375
You're not gonna write her
one of your angry notes, are you?

13:23.458 --> 13:25.375
-'Cause she doesn't deserve it.
-No, I lost my thesaurus.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.041
Okay, well, you go
get her then.

13:28.333 --> 13:32.000
Hello, Nancy. Hi. How...

13:32.083 --> 13:33.875
Could you just check?
There's a very important file that I--

13:33.959 --> 13:36.709
You know what?
This actually means "in a minute."

13:36.792 --> 13:39.750
Tag me in.
I am oiled up and ready to go.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.875
She said, "in a minute,"
so I'm sure that in a minute...

13:41.959 --> 13:44.041
-I just...
-Oh, now it's 2. You're in.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.250
Thank you.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.583
Look here. My friend needs you
to check on the Ben Sullivan file,

13:48.667 --> 13:50.458
and you're gonna
do it right now. Why?

13:50.542 --> 13:52.125
Because you're not
gonna drop the ball

13:52.208 --> 13:53.625
like you did on my patient.

13:53.709 --> 13:54.667
(clears throat)

13:54.750 --> 13:55.959
You said, "drop the ball."

13:56.041 --> 13:57.667
I know. That was
totally by accident.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.041
(both laugh)

13:59.125 --> 14:00.959
-Chop, chop, Nancy!
-(speaking Spanish)

14:01.041 --> 14:02.875
(Squeals)

14:03.834 --> 14:05.792
Hey, there, buddy.

14:05.875 --> 14:09.166
How is my best friend doing?

14:09.250 --> 14:10.917
You and I hardly
know each other.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.208
These aren't my words.

14:14.542 --> 14:17.375
Hello, Dr. Dorian. Let's take a ride.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.041
So word has it you've been doing

14:21.125 --> 14:22.583
a little fishing in these here parts

14:22.667 --> 14:25.333
trying to catch yourself
a big old prize-winning mistake.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.375
No, sir. I've just been asking--

14:26.458 --> 14:29.583
I was sure your little buddy in surgery

14:29.667 --> 14:30.750
would have shared with you

14:30.834 --> 14:33.917
my most important rule
here at sacred heart.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.959
Tell him my most
important rule, Ted.

14:37.041 --> 14:40.875
Too much ha ha
producing boo hoo.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.625
My other rule.

14:42.709 --> 14:47.417
Uh, if you don't look for a mistake,
you can't find one.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.250
That's right,
Teddy bear.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.959
Now...

14:52.041 --> 14:53.250
Stop looking for trouble

14:53.333 --> 14:57.250
just because you like this patient,
and face the facts.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.917
Remove him, Ted.

15:03.834 --> 15:06.458
That ha ha rule is true.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.709
I'm just asking you
to check, Franklyn,

15:08.792 --> 15:10.542
and see if you could
have made a mistake.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.041
Look, I've worked here 7 years
and never made a single mistake.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.417
You mixed up my patients'
urine samples yesterday.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.709
Okay, I make
lots of mistakes,

15:17.792 --> 15:19.417
but I really have to go
to the bathroom right now,

15:19.500 --> 15:20.917
and after that,
I'm going to lunch.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.250
Franklyn.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.000
Can you help me out here?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.750
What do you want me to do, cry?

15:27.834 --> 15:28.750
Can you do that?

15:28.834 --> 15:30.959
Sure, just give me a second
to think of something sad.

15:32.709 --> 15:34.375
-(toilet flushes)
-Quickly, quickly.

15:34.458 --> 15:35.500
Okay, that's not helping.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't even put you
in this position. I...

15:38.083 --> 15:41.417
Oh, there we go. You know, another man
in my life tryin' to protect me.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.125
Stay with it, Elliot.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.625
Everyone thinks that
I'm just this little girl

15:44.709 --> 15:45.875
who can't take
any criticism because

15:45.959 --> 15:47.583
her mom and dad
give her nothing but criticism.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.000
Good, Elliot.
This is good.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.250
And look where
it's gotten me.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.417
You know, I'm 26, single,

15:52.500 --> 15:53.750
and all I do is work.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.709
You know, I may as well
just give up the idea

15:55.792 --> 15:58.542
of being in a healthy and...

15:58.625 --> 16:02.041
A happy relationship
and just go ahead and...

16:02.125 --> 16:04.667
And...and...

16:04.750 --> 16:06.500
Become your mother.

16:06.583 --> 16:11.250
-Yeah.
-(cries)

16:11.333 --> 16:14.542
-Check Mr. Sullivan's tests again.
-Okay.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.875
How cool was that?

16:21.959 --> 16:23.667
Why so sad, Bambi?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.917
(J.D.) <i>Because so far,</i>
<i>no one's screwed up.</i>

16:26.000 --> 16:27.625
The admissions clerk obviously
didn't make a mistake,

16:27.709 --> 16:29.125
and the lab technician
didn't make a mistake.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.041
And maybe I'm just an idiot.
I don't know.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.583
Let me ask
you something...

16:35.834 --> 16:37.583
You're kind of
a boob guy, right?

16:37.667 --> 16:38.750
Excuse me?

16:38.834 --> 16:40.959
I can tell because
I've seen you look at mine.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.875
Um, not in a sleazy way
or anything.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.166
I think this is the most uncomfortable
conversation I've ever had.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.166
You wanna touch one?

16:46.250 --> 16:47.500
I stand corrected.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.250
You're my best friend's girlfriend.

16:49.333 --> 16:54.542
Ah, so your instinct is to pass
on this fantastic, one-time offer?

16:55.291 --> 16:56.458
I'm afraid so.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.792
-I'm up here, Bambi.
-Oh, sorry.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.709
See, with Ben, it's one of 2 things.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.333
Either your
instincts are right,

17:02.417 --> 17:05.000
or your brain is trying to
protect you from something.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.750
I'd say you have pretty good instincts.
Trust them.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.083
What am I supposed
to do, though?

17:11.166 --> 17:13.041
You know there's only
one more person to talk to.

17:13.834 --> 17:16.583
(J.D.) <i>The hematopathologist.</i>

17:18.083 --> 17:19.375
Hello.

-You go by your first name?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.458
-No, first name's Fred.
-Fred Bobb?

17:24.542 --> 17:25.667
What can I do you for?

17:25.750 --> 17:29.291
Hi, I was hoping that you could recheck
Ben Sullivan's blood smear.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.083
Well, that depends, young man.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.750
Do you actually think
I made a mistake,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.375
or do you just wish I did?

17:34.458 --> 17:36.041
I kinda wish you did.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.625
Then I'll do it.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.500
(Ben) Wait.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.709
Sorry there, giant seventies
security guard guy.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.375
-Cold out here, huh?
-Yes.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.834
Unh.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.458
You could hang a friggin'
raincoat off my nipples--

17:51.542 --> 17:54.458
the left one, at least,
and the right one's just a little shy.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.583
-You're stickin' with the weird thing.
-It works for me.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.250
Ha ha.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.500
Listen, um, you guys
wouldn't be keeping me here

18:01.583 --> 18:04.166
if there wasn't something
potentially wrong with me, would you?

18:05.875 --> 18:07.250
No, we wouldn't.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.333
Hey, I wanted to ask you,
um, how come this guy

18:11.417 --> 18:13.291
always, like, is following you
in the pictures?

18:13.375 --> 18:15.000
(J.D.) Oh, my God.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.125
Him.

18:16.208 --> 18:18.542
You wanna see the rest
of the pictures I took today?

18:21.583 --> 18:22.667
Look at that one.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.291
(laughs)

18:25.375 --> 18:26.583
These are good, man.

a picture together.

20:00.125 --> 20:03.333

20:14.166 --> 20:15.500
Wait, why would you want
a picture like that?

20:15.583 --> 20:17.417
I thought you said
that posed pictures aren't real.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.792
Come on, J.D. I know this is real.
You know that.

20:22.875 --> 20:23.875
What do you mean?

20:24.709 --> 20:25.917
Think about it.

20:28.291 --> 20:31.375
Stop looking for trouble
just because you like this patient,

20:31.458 --> 20:33.333
and face the facts.

20:33.417 --> 20:35.083
Either your instincts are right,

20:35.166 --> 20:38.250
or your brain is trying
to protect you from the truth.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.208

I made a mistake,

20:40.291 --> 20:41.875

20:59.875 --> 21:01.625
Let's try this again.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.291
Are those the test results?

21:06.458 --> 21:07.583
Uh, yeah.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.125
Ben, you have leukemia.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.500
