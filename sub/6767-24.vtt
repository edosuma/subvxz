WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.711
VALERIE:
<i>So are you excited?</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:05.130
I'm so excited,

00:05.213 --> 00:06.589
I haven't slept in days.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.758
Well, now you'll be
on Hong Kong time.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.761
Sorry, guys, I had to give
Jim the flight info.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.179
And the companion info?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.557
Yes, for the last time,

00:15.640 --> 00:16.725
{\an1}he's thrilled
about meeting you.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.935
Really?
He said I must be

00:19.018 --> 00:20.437
"very involved."

00:20.520 --> 00:21.980
"Involved"?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.106
He used that word?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.733
{\an1}Val, could you help me
out a little bit?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.860
Uh, yeah.
Listen, Jim and Cindy

00:26.943 --> 00:28.278
give parenting
a really good name.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.946
You'll love them
and they'll love you,

00:30.029 --> 00:32.698
and it'll be this big, huge
nauseating lovefest.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.117
{\an1}Which is perfect,
considering spring break

00:34.200 --> 00:35.785
{\an1}is all about
getting nauseated.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.162
Exactly.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.955
Well, it's too bad you
guys are going to miss

00:39.038 --> 00:41.124
{\an1}the After Dark party; it's
going to be very star-studded.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.293
{\an3}Oh, yes, you and Rob are
going to have to bask

00:43.376 --> 00:45.628
in the paparazzi's
glare without us.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.964
Well, I invited everybody

00:48.047 --> 00:49.257
even though it's
a private party.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.425
Nice touch inviting Kelly.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.634
A very solid olive branch.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.136
{\an1}No, I really
want her to come.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.138
Really.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.140
Mm-hmm.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.142
KELLY:
<i>Not on your life.</i>

00:59.225 --> 01:01.102
It'll be fun.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.062
{\an1}Watching Val
conquer Hollywood?

01:03.146 --> 01:03.980
I don't think so.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.397
It's our last spring break.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.901
And I'm going to make
it a productive one.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.110
By fixing a chair?

01:09.194 --> 01:12.822
We give up on things
way too quickly.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.824
Beautiful things.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.036
I know it hurts.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.371
Brandon taking Tracy
to Hong Kong.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.332
(sighs)

01:22.415 --> 01:24.501
I think I can save this.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.003
But moping is not going to turn
their plane around.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.297
Make it what it was before.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.507
(groans)

01:30.590 --> 01:32.884
Kel, just come okay?

01:32.967 --> 01:35.053
It'll be fun.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.514
I'm not going.
Okay?

01:37.597 --> 01:39.349
I know you don't
want to hear this,

01:39.432 --> 01:42.477
but some things
aren't worth saving.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.626

02:33.027 --> 02:35.071

04:08.748 --> 04:10.708
Don't you guys want to rest
or something like that?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.918
{\an1}What, you
kidding me, Dad?

04:12.001 --> 04:13.336
{\an1}We just spent 16 hours
on a flying hotel.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.505
Besides, I'm too
excited to sleep.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.089
{\an3}What do you think
we should see first?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.050
{\an3}Victoria Harbor
or Kowloon?

04:19.132 --> 04:21.719
Well, I know you guys
are all tanned and rested

04:21.803 --> 04:23.721
and ready to rock and roll,
but for those of us

04:23.805 --> 04:26.015
in Hong Kong
it's still 7:00 a.m.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.351
So why don't you
take some time, unpack

04:28.434 --> 04:29.727
and come on, have some tea

04:29.811 --> 04:32.397
and then we can
go see the sights.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.316
So, welcome
to Casa Walsh East.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.859
It's charming.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.153
{\an1}Yes, in a very
"adults only" sort of way.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.739
{\an1}But, uh, I'll be sure
and rectify that for you, Dad.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.533
I'm sure your mother will be
very happy to hear that.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.785
{\an3}Of course she would.
Oh, I'm sorry we missed her.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.704
Yeah, so is she.
Well, if Brenda

04:47.787 --> 04:49.706
really has mono, she's
doing the right thing.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.166
How long has it been since
all of you've been together?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.838
It's been quite a while.
Well, I'm not surprised,

04:56.921 --> 04:58.464
considering where
you're all located.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.883
We couldn't be more
spread out if we tried.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.011
You know, I think I'm going

05:03.094 --> 05:04.554
to take you up
on that unpacking.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.555
All right, it's, uh,
down the hall,

05:05.638 --> 05:07.056
first door on the left.
Do you want me to help?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.266
Oh, no. I got it.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.475
<i>Doh je.</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:14.105
She's an enthusiast.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.566
{\an5}I've always been
fond of enthusiasts.
Mm-hmm.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.776
{\an1}So how come you've never
told us about Tracy?

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
This may come
as a surprise, Dad,

05:21.279 --> 05:23.322
but there are some thing's
I like to keep to myself.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.742
How disgustingly grown-up.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.035
Next, you're gonna tell me
that you're shaving.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.578
I'll tell you what,
I'll, uh,

05:28.661 --> 05:29.871
I'll buy you a couple
of beers later,

05:29.954 --> 05:31.372
and I'll fill you in
on everything.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.417
It's good to see you.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.085
Yeah, you, too.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.886
I can't believe
you're coming home.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.263
{\an3}Well, I'm mildly beside
myself at the idea.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.765
Well, is there
anything special you want?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.600
Food, magazines...

05:50.683 --> 05:54.437
No, just coming home
is reward enough.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.564
Although a brass band

05:56.647 --> 05:58.483
and a parade,
that would be nice.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.609
Well, considering how well
you're doing,

05:59.692 --> 06:00.485
I'd say that's deserved.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.736
Well, I'm not ready
for the Olympics,

06:01.819 --> 06:06.282
but according to my doctor,
my recovery is just world class.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.575
You know, Mom says

06:07.658 --> 06:08.534
you've been flirting
with all the nurses.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.455
That's one of the perks
of being paralyzed.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.456
Dad!

06:13.539 --> 06:15.458
(both laugh)

06:15.541 --> 06:19.420
But Donna...

06:19.504 --> 06:21.506
we have to face it.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.593
I can't use my right arm or leg.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.512
You have partial use of them.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.430
The doctor says with therapy,
you'll be good as new.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.975
When did he say that?
About ten minutes ago.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.311
He said your short-term
memory will be back, too.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.854
(sighs)

06:39.607 --> 06:42.819
Those are really
beautiful flowers.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.989
Well, Kelly and Clare
were very worried about you.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.491
And I can't wait
to tell them

06:48.574 --> 06:50.034
they don't have
to be worried anymore.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.496
{\an3}I've spoken to the
rehab administrator.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.123
{\an3}He has all the
information he needs.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.374
Oh, thank you.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.501
{\an1}I can't tell you how
good it makes me feel,

06:58.584 --> 07:00.503
knowing that he's going
to such a fine facility.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.796
{\an3}The West Hollywood
Rehab Center

07:01.879 --> 07:03.506
{\an3}is one of the city's best.
Great.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.133
{\an3}John will be in good hands.
Thank you.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.717
Hi, Donna.
Hi.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.177
Hi, sweetheart.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.637
Isn't Daddy doing well?

07:09.720 --> 07:10.847
Yeah, he's doing great.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.140
Uh, what's this

07:12.223 --> 07:13.015
I hear about rehab center?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.642
I thought Daddy
was coming home with us.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.519
Oh, we don't want to rush him.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.479
Didn't the doctor say that
he could be released tomorrow?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.064
That home care
was a real option?

07:20.148 --> 07:23.401
Well, your father's no longer
in a life-threatening situation,

07:23.484 --> 07:24.902
but he's not ready
to come home.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.114
Okay, I, I understand
that he needs rehab,

07:28.197 --> 07:30.158
but he's made
so much progress here,

07:30.241 --> 07:32.034
and he would make
twice as much at home.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.871
Well, he's not coming home
right now.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.706
How could you do this to him?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.708
I'm doing this <i> for</i> him.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.126
And this is a wonderful

07:40.209 --> 07:41.836
{\an1}care facility.
He belongs at home.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.337
They can provide
all the support services

07:43.421 --> 07:45.214
that your father
really needs right now.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.384
No, what he needs right now
is our love and affection.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.261
Yes, and he'll get that.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.221
{\an1}And more.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.223
Donna, don't make this

07:54.307 --> 07:55.683
any harder
than it already is.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.030
{\an1}I say we stay
in bed all day.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.116
Hmm, honey,
it's almost 3:00.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.410
We have been
in bed all day.

08:14.493 --> 08:17.455
{\an1}Uh-huh, time flies.
Hmm.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.748
Why don't we order in

08:18.831 --> 08:20.333
{\an1}and pop in
a couple of videos?

08:20.416 --> 08:22.668
And miss the big
Party TV bash?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.295
I don't think so.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.589
(phone rings)
Oh.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.591
Mm, ignore it.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.052
Honey, I like you,
but not that much.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.095
(ringing continues)

08:36.682 --> 08:38.726
Hello?

08:38.808 --> 08:40.727
ALAN:
<i>So we're set?</i>

08:40.811 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, but this
is not a good time.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.065
But you got Rob
coming to the party?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.024
Yes, that's what I said.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.109
Hey, don't cop attitude
with me, sweetheart.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.277
We're partners,
am I right?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.572
Yeah. Listen, just send me
the paperwork.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.491
I'll renew my subscription.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.078
Sounded like a pain.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.996
You can't imagine.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.375
Hey, where are you going?

09:03.834 --> 09:05.544
We're going to the party.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.421
You're not talking about
the one all the fake people

09:07.505 --> 09:09.757
faking smiles and talking
about my movie, are you?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.134
No, I'm taking about
the one with fake people

09:12.218 --> 09:14.428
faking smiles
and gushing about your movie.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.138
It's for a promotion.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
You promised your manager.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.767
I know.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.185
I know it's at the After Dark,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.980
but I'd still rather
stay in bed all day.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.774
Listen to me, okay?

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
You did a great movie.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.156
And people should see it.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.034
And if that means
plastering on a smile

09:37.118 --> 09:39.495
and doing a few silly interviews
to make it happen,

09:39.578 --> 09:40.663
then it's worth it.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.331
I guess so.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.375
I never know what to say
in those interviews.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.669
Well, then we've got
a lot of preparing to do.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.296
Crack the whip any harder,

09:48.379 --> 09:49.880
I'd swear you own
a piece of me, too.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.050
Take that back.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.176
I'm not Alan.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.137
Hey, I know you're not.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.722
I care about you.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.473
I care about you, too.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.766
I'm sorry.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.187
I'm sorry.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.398
Yeah.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.027
Come on, let's go.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.409
Well, well...

10:18.492 --> 10:19.869
{\an1}Hey, had a chance
to look around?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.370
{\an3}Absolutely,
the place is great.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.372
Oh, your mom's made
it feel like home.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.373
Yeah.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.875
Brandon, I want to talk to you

10:25.958 --> 10:27.585
about not coming to visit

10:27.668 --> 10:30.046
{\an1}sooner, I...
You've been busy.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.548
Thanks for letting me
off the hook.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.216
You picked up with your life
and moved on.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.885
It's what you had to do.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.720
In a couple months, I'm going
to have to do the same thing.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.722
I only hope I can do it
as seamlessly as you have.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.265
You'll do fine.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.850
Got any plans?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.560
Got a couple of parties
I'm looking forward to.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
And they say your generation's
not motivated.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.897
{\an3}Okay, fine.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.025
{\an3}I have plans, but that's
two months away.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.070
Right now, I just want
to hang out with Tracy

10:54.153 --> 10:56.030
and everybody, and
have a good time.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.198
Wow, she's terrific.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
I bet everybody loves her.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.492
Uh, Val does.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.868
{\an3}Steve's a lock,
and Donna

11:00.951 --> 11:02.578
loves everybody, so...

11:02.661 --> 11:03.746
How about Kelly?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.081
What about her?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.707
Well, I don't know.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.042
How's she doing?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.919
Fine, I guess.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.587
Who's she seeing?

11:11.670 --> 11:13.923
What am I,
my ex's keeper?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.926
Oh. Sorry, I asked.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.010
Forget about it.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.763
Hey, you guys ready to go?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.640
{\an3}Yeah, what took
you so long?

11:22.723 --> 11:24.433
Oh, I was just
giving you guys

11:24.517 --> 11:25.935
{\an1}a little time
to gossip about me.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.603
{\an3}Oh.
Should my ears

11:27.686 --> 11:29.772
have been burning?
<i>En fuego.</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
Let's go.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.441
Second <i> en fuego</i> for me.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.484
{\an3}(chuckles)

11:33.567 --> 11:34.819
I know.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.783
You know, when Steve
and I go away,

11:40.866 --> 11:42.284
we always fight.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.786
I'll bet Brandon and Tracy

11:43.869 --> 11:45.788
are at each others
throats right now.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.373
I'm not jealous, Clare.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.958
Cats and dogs.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.793
Hatfields and McCoys.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.962
Arabs...
Clare?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.840
{\an1}Well, I'm just saying
it's a possibility.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.133
{\an3}Aren't you supposed
to be at some

11:57.216 --> 11:58.926
party or something?

11:59.009 --> 12:00.928
Clare?
Meter's running.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.013
Okay, one sec.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.307
Are you sure you
don't want to go?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.810
I appreciate the effort.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.104
{\an3}I do, but
I'm not going.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.857
(mumbles)

12:12.940 --> 12:14.108
Yep, yep, yep.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.401
(screams)

12:15.484 --> 12:18.529
STEVE:
Oh, God!

12:20.239 --> 12:21.824
{\an1}Oh, boy, oh, boy.
CLARE: Are you okay?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.451
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.577
I'm sorry, Kel.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.663
{\an6}CLARE:
Oh, it's not
your fault.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.290
We should have
thrown it out.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.834
You are not going
to let up, are you?

12:31.917 --> 12:32.710
CLARE: Yeah.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.128
Once you agree to
come to the party.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.838
{\an6}STEVE:
Yeah, come on.
Open bar.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.840
Lots of guys, spandex...

12:37.923 --> 12:39.717
{\an3}Great way to forget
about the, uh,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.719
{\an3}Orient Express,
if you know what I mean.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.264
Once more for the hearing
impaired: I am not jealous.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.682
{\an1}Well, what's
holding you here?

12:49.477 --> 12:50.686
Nothing now.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.605
Let's go.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.856
{\an1}Yay.
I'll get dressed.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.774
I think I got
a splinter, honey.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.527
(laughing)

12:58.611 --> 13:01.322
(horn honking)

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
VALERIE:
Limo's here. You ready?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.621
Ready as I'll ever be.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.581
Wow!

13:10.664 --> 13:12.541
So you remember what
you're going to say?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.001
{\an1}Yeah, "the director
was fabulous.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.045
{\an1}My costar was wonderful
to work with."

13:16.128 --> 13:18.339
You're amazing.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.267
Thank you.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.066
{\an1}Hey, kid.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.567
Alan, what are you
doing here?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.902
Ah, come on.
Is that any way to greet

13:39.985 --> 13:41.445
your biggest fan?
Come here, you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
Hey, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.535
{\an1}Your date.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.954
ALAN:
Rob Andrews,

13:50.037 --> 13:51.956
{\an1}Heather Dixon.
Pleasure.

13:52.039 --> 13:52.915
Yeah, I just signed her
last night.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.749
Nice to meet you.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.376
The vermin agents
I saved her from,

13:55.459 --> 13:56.377
you wouldn't believe.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.378
It's a wonder

13:57.461 --> 13:58.796
why we can't see a halo.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.006
Valerie Malone.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.758
Do you work with Rob?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.593
No, we're just
close friends.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.470
{\an1}Yeah, every studio in town
wants a piece of her.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.055
{\an1}You guys are going
to make quite an impression.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.599
I'm sorry,
I'm going with Valerie.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.893
{\an1}Rob, I got,
I got an itch here.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.395
{\an1}I need for you
to give it a scratch.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.230
I said I'm going with Valerie.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.606
Okay, okay,
all right.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.400
{\an1}Fine, why don't
you ask the lady?

14:19.483 --> 14:22.278
{\an1}I'm sure she understands
how important this is.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.907
Um, sweetie,

14:26.991 --> 14:27.783
it's no big deal.

14:27.866 --> 14:28.784
You know, uh,
business is business.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.287
{\an1}Yeah, come on. It'll be fun.
Champagne's on ice.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.621
It's okay.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.956
I'll see you there.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.624
{\an1}You sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.710
Okay, come on,
let's go, kids.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.214
(car starts)

14:49.096 --> 14:50.973
They make a cute couple.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.018
Professionally speaking.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.492
{\an3}You know, the more I read,
the more I'm convinced

15:10.576 --> 15:12.453
{\an3}that my Dad should
come home.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.622
I don't know, Don.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.248
{\an1}Memory loss, poor judgment,
depression...

15:16.332 --> 15:17.124
My dad's not depressed.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.461
It says in here
depression is nearly

15:20.544 --> 15:22.463
universal among people
who've had a stroke.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.841
How's my girl?

15:27.426 --> 15:28.802
Holding up, I guess.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.095
Well, if you need anything...

15:31.055 --> 15:32.806
Take care of her.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.851
Look, Donna, I'm on your side
here, all right?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.436
It's just...
this is a big decision.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.355
I just want to make sure you
make the right one.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.105
You know when I was little,

15:40.189 --> 15:41.690
whenever I got sick,
my mom,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.609
she would run straight
to the medicine cabinet.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.486
But not my dad.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.820
He always said
that no pill worked

15:46.904 --> 15:48.656
"as well as a little TLC."

15:48.739 --> 15:50.157
And then he'd pick me up,

15:50.240 --> 15:51.742
and he'd put me in my bed.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.495
And he had these little prisms
that he'd hang in my window.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.330
And he said they'd take me
over the rainbow

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
to the land of candy
and chocolate.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.584
And I always felt better
in my own room.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.670
So will he.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.713
There's no use arguing
with you, is there?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.757
Not when I'm right.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.634
Okay, fine.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.177
Look, when you go back
to the hospital,

16:10.260 --> 16:12.054
I'm going to try and get
in touch with one of these, uh,

16:12.137 --> 16:13.597
support groups, see if I can
get some information

16:13.681 --> 16:14.765
on in-home care.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.892
Thanks.

16:16.975 --> 16:17.851
For everything.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.019
Oh, please, come on.

16:19.103 --> 16:19.812
What, you've spent,
like, a year

16:19.895 --> 16:21.230
helping me through
all my problems?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.524
It's the least I can do.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.068
Well, my dad
specifically asked me

16:26.151 --> 16:26.944
to tell you he feels better.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.530
Aha, that's two Martins
down, one to go.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.241
First, we'll work on my mom
about bringing my dad home,

16:32.324 --> 16:33.742
then we work on her about you.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.618
How's that sound?

16:34.702 --> 16:37.079
Like we've got our work
cut out for us.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.748
Hmm.

unrestrained.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.041
{\an1}Well, you know,
that makes sense.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.334
You know, the Brits
took this place over

18:05.417 --> 18:07.002
{\an1}after they were
at war with China

18:07.086 --> 18:08.545

Well, the illustrations
are incredible.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.021
What's the story?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.857
The story is universal.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.901
It's an old fable
about a prince

18:30.984 --> 18:32.694
in love with two princesses,

18:32.778 --> 18:35.030
{\an3}each living on
a different shore.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.157
Unable to decide

18:37.241 --> 18:39.535
{\an3}which to marry, the
prince would sail back

18:39.618 --> 18:42.037
and forth between the two.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.749
One night,
his ship sinks in a storm.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.044
{\an1}Oh, that's an uplifting,
little tale.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.505
How does it end?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.799
He drowns
in his own indecision.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.009
Quite a moral.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.542
Since when?

19:29.501 --> 19:31.169
{\an3}Since Rob's
friend arrived.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.421
VALERIE:
Director Cameron Crowe

19:32.504 --> 19:34.590
{\an3}was asking for you.
I can't believe

19:34.673 --> 19:35.924
{\an3}Cameron Crowe
wants to meet me.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.426
I love his movies.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.595
Well, Alan sent your demo tape,
and he totally flipped.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.597
{\an5}He wants to meet
you right away.
Wait. Where is Alan?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.432
I've got to thank him.
Oh, no, you don't have time.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.600
{\an1}Come on.
Okay.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.560
{\an1}And you don't want
to keep Cameron waiting.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.769
Yeah.
Good luck.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.313
Thanks.
Have fun.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.565
VALERIE:
Hmm.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.941
Oh, excuse me.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.777
{\an1}Listen, take her
to the Beverly Hilton, okay?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.613
{\an1}Get stuck in traffic,
and a lot of it.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.573
Great, thanks.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.201
Hmm.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.580
<i>Doh je.</i>

20:06.663 --> 20:08.248
You know, I've got
to hand it to you.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.291
You sure know
your way around.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
Well, Brandon's mom and I

20:11.543 --> 20:12.878
{\an1}didn't want to just
be tourists here.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.129
Just in time for

20:14.212 --> 20:16.423
the Communist takeover.
Nice timing, Dad.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.133
Yeah, do you think everything's
going to change?

20:18.216 --> 20:19.635
It might.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.511
See, now that's the Jim Walsh
I know and love.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.972
Communist take over,
no problem.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.309
{\an3}Makes me embarrassed to worry
about life after college.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.977
{\an3}The only reason
you should be embarrassed

20:29.061 --> 20:30.646
is you've got nothing
to sweat about.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.439
You've got tons of options.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.982
Having options and actually
choosing between them

20:34.066 --> 20:35.525
are two entirely
different things.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.986
{\an1}So, Papa Walsh,
I've come

20:38.070 --> 20:40.781
7,100 miles for a little wisdom.
You'd better make it good.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.618
Don't ask what's
in the bird's nest soup.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.496
{\an1}And...

20:47.579 --> 20:49.456
find something you love doing,
the rest will fall into place.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.417
That's it? "Find something you
love..." Wait a minute,

20:52.501 --> 20:54.628
Wait a minute.
I came across 14 time zones

20:54.711 --> 20:56.463
and the International
date line for that?

20:56.546 --> 20:59.049
BRANDON:
No, uh, no Confucius?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.343
No, uh, no Dalai Lama?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.636
No fortune cookie,

21:02.719 --> 21:04.471
{\an5}no nothing,
that's it?
Well...

21:04.554 --> 21:06.181
I think everything
falls into place

21:06.264 --> 21:08.350
after you find someone you love.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.435
Well said.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.278
(knocking)

21:22.114 --> 21:23.740
{\an3}Hey.
I can't believe my mom.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.742
{\an3}She won't even talk to me
about Dad coming home.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.035
Ah, come on, come on.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.454
Before you get all worked up,
I want to show you something.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.708
I met with this great
support group today.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.209
And they showed me
all this home equipment

21:34.292 --> 21:35.544
for people who've had strokes.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.378
It's incredible.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.546
{\an1}Look at this,
a handheld shower head.

21:37.629 --> 21:42.009
For those hard-to-reach places,
a long-handled bath brush.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.344
Velcro shoes.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.721
Long-handled shoe horn.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.597
And this isn't even
half of it.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.891
They have a whole book
full of stuff. Check that out.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.228
Oh. This is perfect.

21:53.311 --> 21:54.521
Everything I need
to show my mom

21:54.604 --> 21:56.356
that my dad can
cope around the house.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.733
David, you're a genius.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.402
Well, not quite,
but I am smart enough to realize

22:00.485 --> 22:01.737
that outfitting
your parents' house

22:01.820 --> 22:02.904
is the least
of your problems.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.865
What do you mean?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.033
This stuff's great.

22:06.116 --> 22:06.908
(sighs)

22:06.992 --> 22:09.244
Put your left arm
behind your back.

22:09.327 --> 22:10.328
What?

22:10.412 --> 22:12.539
They gave me all the stuff
to combat the problem,

22:12.622 --> 22:15.083
but they also
taught me a lesson

22:15.167 --> 22:16.585
in just how severe it is.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.588
Just, just do it.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.215
All right, here.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.010
Peel it.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.597
All right, fine.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.015
Open that.

22:30.098 --> 22:33.602
Come on, we can do
this stuff for him.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.104
Are you gonna tie
his tie's for him, too?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.439
Of course.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.274
Drive his car, wash his back?

22:39.357 --> 22:40.067
David...

22:40.150 --> 22:41.068
Button his shirts?

22:41.151 --> 22:42.486
I can do this.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.237
{\an1}I'm sure you can,
but your mother

22:44.321 --> 22:46.156
doesn't want you to--
and all the equipment

22:46.239 --> 22:48.450
in the world doesn't matter
if she's against it.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.911
Well, maybe it's not up to her.

22:50.994 --> 22:54.122
{\an5}(sighs):
Donna, if you use this stuff
to lobby your dad

22:54.206 --> 22:56.083
and your mother finds out,
she'll go ballistic.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.001
Probably.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.169
So what, you're
gonna do it anyway?

22:59.252 --> 23:02.172
Look... either
I make my mom happy,

23:02.255 --> 23:05.759
or I do what I think
is best for my dad.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.303
And under these
circumstances, I choose B.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.140
All right.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.729
(camera shutters clicking)

23:19.815 --> 23:21.691
Haven't we met before?

23:21.775 --> 23:24.319
{\an3}Yeah, in my nightmare--
you gave me the brush-off

23:24.402 --> 23:25.278
ten minutes ago.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.197
That was my evil twin.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.323
I'm sorry.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.658
I'm Kelly.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.493
Pete.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.161
What changed your outlook?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.163
Let's just say it's
not enough that I'm happy,

23:35.247 --> 23:38.834
my enemies have to be miserable.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.960
(chuckles):
All right.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.171
{\an1}A toast--
to broken chairs

23:43.255 --> 23:45.173
{\an1}that should really
just do us all

23:45.257 --> 23:47.008
{\an1}a huge favor and...
stay broken.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.344
{\an5}(chuckles):
To broken chairs,
whatever that means.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.138
It means let's have fun.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.305
Great. Let's dance.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.181
No, let's not--

23:53.265 --> 23:55.684
{\an1}let's sit and get
to know each other, huh?

23:55.767 --> 23:57.018
Sounds good to me.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.688
{\an1}Well, Kelly seems to be
having a good time.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.022
I wonder why.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.858
{\an1}Well, maybe it's
love at first sight.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.026
I doubt it.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.154
♪ ♪

24:09.781 --> 24:11.992
So, where's Heather?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.034
Went back to the party.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.035
I don't think so.
We had a deal.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.745
Yeah, and the word "floozy"
wasn't in it,

24:15.829 --> 24:16.746
not even in fine print.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.332
I have made you
a great deal of money recently.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.292
And from where I sit,

24:20.375 --> 24:22.252
I think I'm the breadwinner
of this couple.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.920
He's my client;
I call the shots.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.213
Oh, really?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.381
Well, Alan, let's review, okay?

24:26.464 --> 24:29.843
Um, you wanted Rob
to do the movie,

24:29.926 --> 24:32.387
and you needed me
to get him to do it.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.890
You wanted Rob to come
to the party, and you needed me

24:34.973 --> 24:36.016
to get him to come.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.935
You may get the ten percent,
but I call the shots.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.194
Is Alan okay?

24:47.277 --> 24:48.069
Yeah, he's fine.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.572
{\an1}Um, he just, you know,
was confused about

24:50.655 --> 24:53.617
{\an1}a couple of things,
so I straightened him out.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.411
{\an3}Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened with Heather.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.163
I forgot about it.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.581
Don't worry.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.208
(chuckles)

25:15.305 --> 25:16.431
DONNA:
<i>Rings on zippers,</i>

25:16.514 --> 25:18.600
{\an3}suction cups under
dishes, shower seats.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.936
Wait-wait-wait, they've got
lower beds, handrails,

25:21.019 --> 25:22.729
they even have a chairlift.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.981
Everything we need to outfit
the house so you can come home.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.485
I'm not coming home.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.987
{\an1}I know I said
that I would...

25:31.905 --> 25:33.949
...but I was wrong.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.243
Um...

25:36.326 --> 25:39.579
{\an3}Look, I... I'm sure
that the rehab facility

25:39.663 --> 25:41.414
Mom picked out is great,

25:41.498 --> 25:43.833
{\an3}but I really think you should
consider the alternative.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.585
I already have, honey.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.128
{\an1}(sighs):
Outfitting the house

25:47.212 --> 25:49.881
is not the answer.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.466
But this stuff is great.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.759
It is.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.302
But it's not enough.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.805
That's Mom talking.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.307
She and I agree on this.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.935
Do you, Daddy?

26:02.018 --> 26:03.979
Yes.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.982
'Cause if you don't,
you should say so.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.484
This is your decision.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.529
I really appreciate
everything you've done.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.865
But you have a life,

26:15.949 --> 26:17.951
and a wonderful friend
to lead it with.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.829
You are not a burden.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.289
No.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.665
(chuckles):
Oh, no, I'm not,

26:23.748 --> 26:26.918
and I have no intention
of becoming one.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.056
What does a girl have to do
to get a drink around here?

26:40.140 --> 26:41.349
Hello?

26:41.433 --> 26:42.684
{\an3}Hey, don't you think
you've had enough?

26:42.767 --> 26:45.353
Clare, no.
Come on, lighten up.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.730
Um, hello? Yoo-hoo?

26:46.813 --> 26:47.814
Red wine.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.190
And another greyhound.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.692
Maybe we should
go home, okay?

26:50.775 --> 26:53.028
Why, because I'm having
too much fun?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.362
{\an3}Kel...

26:54.446 --> 26:56.531
Will you excuse us
for just one minute?

26:56.614 --> 26:58.700
{\an4}Sure.
You wanted me
to forget about Brandon,

26:58.783 --> 27:00.827
{\an1}so I'm forgetting him--
what's your problem?

27:00.910 --> 27:02.495
This guy, he's a stranger.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.581
{\an1}I'm just flirting--
it's making me feel better.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.915
{\an1}Besides, he's not
a stranger anymore.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.711
What'd you say
your name was?

27:09.794 --> 27:11.296
Pete.
Pete, Pete, right.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.049
Okay, let's go.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.926
{\an3}Clare, send my regards
to Hong Kong.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.348
{\an1}Yeah.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.558
Well, if it isn't
the happy couple.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.977
{\an3}So, uh, any
word on Heather?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.395
Not a peep.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.563
{\an3}She's just
disappointed.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.773
{\an1}Hmm.
She's a real flake.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.441
{\an1}You sure know
how to pick 'em.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.861
Listen, I think you
owe Val an apology.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.032
I'm sorry, I was a snake.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.367
But at least

27:40.450 --> 27:41.910
you can see me slithering
across the room.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.453
This one,
she'll cut your heart out

27:43.536 --> 27:45.288
and make you think
she's doing you a favor.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.749
{\an3}Well, coming from someone
who's in the movie business,

27:47.832 --> 27:49.584
{\an3}I guess I'll take
that as a compliment.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.920
{\an6}Come on.
I paid her ten
grand last week

27:52.003 --> 27:54.422
to help me convince you
to do your next picture.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.965
What are you saying?

27:57.175 --> 27:59.719
What's he talking about?

28:00.678 --> 28:02.222
Well, he paid me

28:02.305 --> 28:04.099
to get you to do
that movie you hated.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.476
But you and I both know
that you're not gonna do it.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.478
You took money?

28:08.561 --> 28:09.604
Why didn't you tell me?

28:09.687 --> 28:12.899
Well, I was going to,
but I-I just wanted to make sure

28:12.982 --> 28:15.485
that you knew what
a sleazebag manager you have,

28:15.568 --> 28:17.404
and after today,
I think you do.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.738
Oh, that's priceless.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.615
{\an3}Who else but a
sleaze would use you

28:20.698 --> 28:21.950
{\an3}to launch some
bimbo's career, huh?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.618
That is a lie, all right?

28:23.701 --> 28:25.620
It was for <i> your</i> career, too.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.289
Come on, Rob, you understand.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.999
Sure I do.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.626
You're fired.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.628
What?

28:33.711 --> 28:35.130
Come on, you know
what kind of girl this is?

28:35.213 --> 28:36.631
{\an1}Making somebody
else look bad

28:36.714 --> 28:37.632
doesn't make you look good.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.259
{\an3}Yeah, well, think
again, kid.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.594
Because you need me a hell
of a lot more than I need you.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.846
No, I don't.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.725
(scoffs)

28:50.562 --> 28:52.021
{\an3}Listen, um, let
me explain, okay?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.607
I-I want to tell
you why I did it.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.611
I'm sure you do.

29:04.409 --> 29:08.204
{\an5}JIM:
<i>I called the apartment--</i>
<i>the cab got Tracy home okay.</i>

29:08.288 --> 29:10.331
Thanks.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.333
{\an3}So, Dad, tell me
how you feel

29:12.417 --> 29:15.336
{\an3}about this, uh,
takeover in Hong Kong?

29:15.420 --> 29:17.547
I told you, it'll be fine.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.799
You're telling me
that as my father;

29:19.883 --> 29:21.676
I'm asking you
as my friend.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.678
As your friend...

29:23.761 --> 29:25.638
I'm terrified.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.474
{\an1}How about you
and graduation?

29:28.766 --> 29:31.144
As your son, um...

29:31.227 --> 29:33.062
mild anxiety.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.814
And as my friend?

29:35.815 --> 29:37.442
I'm off the charts.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.904
Kind of like you and Tracy.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.324
I can see that

29:44.407 --> 29:46.201
she cares about you quite a bit.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.328
And I care about her.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.205
How much?

29:50.288 --> 29:51.831
As my friend.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.169
A little less
than she cares about me.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.172
I think you ought to tell her.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.216
{\an1}Why?
Brandon, I can see

30:01.299 --> 30:02.383
you still care about Kelly.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.053
Dad, let's not get into that.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.554
It's obvious.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.227
Okay.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.901
After Kelly
turned me down, I, um...

30:19.984 --> 30:22.403
I held on to the engagement ring

30:22.487 --> 30:24.239
for quite a while.

30:24.322 --> 30:29.577
But then, a couple of weeks ago,
I returned it.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.538
And that's that.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.416
Well, if that's how you feel.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.751
That's how I feel.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.294
{\an3}Of <i> course</i> that's
how I feel.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.672
{\an3}Why else would I bring
Tracy to Hong Kong?

30:40.755 --> 30:43.424
{\an1}Because I sent you
two tickets.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.218
That's not funny.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.221
{\an1}I wasn't trying to be funny.
(clears throat)

30:48.304 --> 30:51.432
{\an1}I just don't want to see you
making a mistake.

30:52.850 --> 30:55.728
I'm not making a mistake, Dad.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.814
I know what I'm doing.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.331
(sighs):
Look at her.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.833
She's throwing herself
all over him.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.918
STEVE:
Oh, Clare, let her be.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.505
I can't; it's wrong.
It's none of your business!

31:22.589 --> 31:24.299
At least tell me
your last name.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.300
Mm-mm, no.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.010
{\an1}Why not?
Because after tonight

31:27.093 --> 31:29.387
we are never going
to see each other again.

31:30.471 --> 31:31.931
(giggles):
Hey, get back.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.225
{\an1}Oh, sorry about that.
Oh, my God,

31:34.309 --> 31:35.643
my ring.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.104
Whatever it is,
we can find it.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.317
{\an1}Now what?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.319
{\an6}Get back, get back.
STEVE:
What's going on here?

31:44.402 --> 31:45.820
{\an1}Beats the hell
out of me.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.196
{\an3}One minute
we're into it,

31:47.280 --> 31:49.073
the next she's freaking out--
she's too weird.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.658
{\an6}KELLY:
You have to help
me find it.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.493
{\an3}Wh-What are you
looking for, Kel?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.828
{\an3}Here it is.

31:53.911 --> 31:54.954
Here it is, Kelly.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.372
Oh, thank God!

31:56.456 --> 31:57.957
Come on,
I'm taking you home.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.595
Mom?

32:13.097 --> 32:14.682
Mom?

32:16.392 --> 32:18.019
Where's Daddy?

32:18.102 --> 32:19.187
{\an3}They're taking
some X-rays

32:19.270 --> 32:21.064
{\an3}to make sure that
his lungs are clear.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.858
He's doing so well.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.944
He was doing better before you
spoke to him about coming home.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.154
I specifically

32:28.237 --> 32:32.408
asked you to not make an already
difficult situation worse.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.244
I just wanted Daddy
to know his options.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.206
That is so easy for you to say--
just bring him home.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.833
You're not the one
who's gonna have to feed him,

32:40.917 --> 32:42.543
to bathe him, to dress him.

32:42.627 --> 32:46.047
Your life is not gonna change;
mine is.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.799
I thought the person whose life

32:47.882 --> 32:50.051
we were concerned
about here was Dad.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.761
But what difference
does that make now?

32:51.844 --> 32:55.056
I mean, he's already
made up his mind.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.230
Mom?

33:06.150 --> 33:08.069
Mom...

33:08.152 --> 33:10.238
you can do this.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.657
No, I can't.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.577
He's always been the strong one.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.621
You're scared.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.416
You say that like it's a shock.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.626
I've just never seen you
like this before.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.921
All my... strength and attitude

33:27.004 --> 33:29.257
has... come from knowing

33:29.340 --> 33:33.553
that he would always be there
to pick me up if I fell.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.097
{\an6}You're not gonna fall.
Yeah, but what
if I do?

33:36.180 --> 33:40.601
What... what if I'm alone
with him and something happens?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.396
Well, you won't be alone--
we'll get a nurse, and...

33:43.479 --> 33:45.815
and I'll be there
as much as I can.

33:45.898 --> 33:49.152
Boy, you have his confidence.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.070
You always have.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.490
You've always had mine.

34:03.332 --> 34:06.961
{\an5}(chuckles):
So, you really think
I can do this, huh?

34:11.215 --> 34:13.050
I know you can.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.304
Well, then I guess

34:17.388 --> 34:20.099
we're gonna have to get
the house set up, huh?

34:20.183 --> 34:21.976
{\an1}You leave that
all up to me, okay?

34:37.116 --> 34:40.077
(rings doorbell)

34:44.081 --> 34:46.208
You'll have to do
better than that.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.087
I'm sorry.

34:52.715 --> 34:56.010
{\an5}(sighs):
Look... I promise
it'll never happen again.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.807
How can I be sure?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.350
I trusted you.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.352
And I didn't violate that trust.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.979
I always had
your best interest at heart.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.482
I'd really like
to believe that.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.403
Just let me explain, okay?

35:14.487 --> 35:16.864
Alan's a jerk.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.199
He's only
looking out for himself.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.076
I mean, that's
why I took the money,

35:20.159 --> 35:23.079
I mean, to show you
what kind of guy he really is.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.164
{\an3}So I guess
that leaves you.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.083
What do you mean?

35:27.166 --> 35:29.043
You want to be my manager, Val?

35:29.126 --> 35:30.753
(laughs):
Me?

35:30.837 --> 35:34.257
Uh, I don't know anything
about being a manager.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.716
Now who's kidding who?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.510
You could do it, Val.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.512
You could learn.

35:39.595 --> 35:43.224
No. No, listen, I-I don't want
to mix business with pleasure.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.560
Look, I could
use the help.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.062
{\an3}I'd rather give you the ten
percent than some shark.

35:48.145 --> 35:50.064
You serious?

35:50.147 --> 35:52.066
You're all I got.

35:53.359 --> 35:57.029
So, I guess this means that
you're accepting my apology?

35:57.113 --> 35:59.240
Guess so.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.200
(laughs)

36:20.011 --> 36:21.929
Got your note.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.389
I got up early.

36:23.472 --> 36:26.225
Couldn't sleep.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.102
I negotiated a great price.

36:28.185 --> 36:29.103
Why?

36:29.186 --> 36:30.730
Because I couldn't afford

36:30.813 --> 36:31.939
what he was asking.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.774
I meant the book.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.818
Why do you want it?

36:35.902 --> 36:36.527
I don't know.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.195
It just kind of struck a cord.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.616
{\an3}(sighs)

36:41.699 --> 36:43.242
I thought we were past all this.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.119
The wound's still healing.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.290
You just... can't rush it.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.294
Understood.

36:53.377 --> 36:57.131
Tell me I'm not tiding you over
until someone else comes along.

36:57.214 --> 36:59.300
You're not.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.135
Because if I am....

37:01.219 --> 37:02.428
You're not.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.848
Okay?

37:07.850 --> 37:09.018
Okay.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.818
{\an5}Let's go get
some dim sum.
Yeah!

37:17.902 --> 37:20.112
{\an1}Or something else.
(laughs)

37:27.203 --> 37:29.455
Your work really shows.

37:29.538 --> 37:31.666
Oh, man,
those prisms look great.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.125
Thank you.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.963
Well, the handrailing
and, uh, shower seat

37:37.046 --> 37:39.298
{\an1}are all set up
in the bathroom.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.509
And you put the ramp up
over the stairs?

37:41.592 --> 37:43.511
Ready and waiting--
and anything we didn't get done,

37:43.594 --> 37:44.679
the in-home care people said

37:44.762 --> 37:46.180
they would have done
by next week.

37:46.263 --> 37:47.848
And my mom has nurses
coming tomorrow

37:47.932 --> 37:48.891
for my dad to interview.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.184
Great.
Yeah.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.647
(sighs):
Well... this looks great.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.232
{\an4}I'm really
proud of you.
Thanks.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.733
{\an1}DR. MARTIN (calls):
Sweetheart?

37:57.817 --> 37:58.859
Oh, they're here.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.112
Daddy.

38:01.195 --> 38:04.532
{\an4}(chuckles):
Hi.
Yay!

38:04.615 --> 38:06.409
Hi, baby.

38:06.492 --> 38:07.868
{\an1}David!

38:07.952 --> 38:09.537
Welcome home.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.248
{\an1}Mm, I'm so glad
you're back.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.667
So, how's it look?

38:14.750 --> 38:17.169
It looks perfect.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.548
Beautiful.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.050
You have done a wonderful job.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.927
Thanks, Mom.

38:39.942 --> 38:40.860
Hey.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.236
Are you awake?

38:42.319 --> 38:44.822
Mm, I am now.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.699
What are you doing here?

38:46.782 --> 38:50.870
{\an6}Well, I just thought
maybe you'd like to
talk a little bit.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.955
Hmm. Not really.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.794
Kel... you got
to give up on Brandon.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.256
I know about the ring.

39:02.339 --> 39:05.092
Yeah, you and half
the free world now.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.261
No, no. Just me and Clare.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.472
{\an3}And I know last
night's freak-out

39:09.555 --> 39:11.807
was because
you thought you lost it.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.854
I just don't get how you got it
back in the first place.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.401
(sighs):
I bought it...

39:22.485 --> 39:25.446
from the jeweler
after Brandon returned it.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.073
Well, why would you do that?

39:27.156 --> 39:30.618
I didn't want
anyone else to have it.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.413
Kelly, you got
to get through this.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.123
Why don't you
take that ring

39:36.207 --> 39:37.750
and put it someplace.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.710
Put it where it's out of sight,

39:39.794 --> 39:41.796
where it won't
cause you any pain.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.673
Will you do that for me?

39:46.759 --> 39:50.638
Listen, it's bad enough that
you and Clare know about this.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.598
Don't tell Brandon, okay?

39:52.681 --> 39:54.308
I won't.

39:54.391 --> 39:55.309
Promise?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.228
I promise.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.736
Thanks.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.281
Now get out of here.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.708
(door closes)

40:45.734 --> 40:48.404
(sniffles)

40:49.488 --> 40:51.448
(sighs)
