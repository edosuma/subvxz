00:19.800 --> 00:21.765
Thank you, Thank you!

00:21.800 --> 00:27.700
Hello and Welcome to what is,
tonight, a Top Gear special.

00:27.735 --> 00:30.452
It's special because it is just one big film.

00:30.487 --> 00:33.135
Yep. And to make it, we had to go on holiday.

00:33.170 --> 00:36.600
Well you say it was a holiday, but
actually it was a fly-drive holiday,

00:36.635 --> 00:38.315
so it wasn't a holiday at all.

00:38.350 --> 00:42.565
Because of course you get to the car hire desk,
and there is the gaudiness man with spiky hair.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.600
And he types "War and Peace" into his computer for 16
hours. And then he doesn't know where England is.

00:47.635 --> 00:49.065
And he steals your driving license.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.600
And that he directs you to a car park where your car isn't.

00:53.170 --> 00:56.470
So we're all gonna try and see if we could make it any better.

00:56.505 --> 00:58.950
Rather than suffer the misery of hiring a car,

00:58.985 --> 01:01.265
maybe it made more sense to buy one.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.670
We were each given the budget of 1000 dollars.

01:03.705 --> 01:05.920
Yeah, now here is the really clever bit.

01:05.955 --> 01:07.185
At the end of our holiday,

01:07.220 --> 01:10.350
which is essentially a road trip across 4 states,

01:10.385 --> 01:11.965
we would see if,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.150
instead of simply having to hand our hired car back,

01:14.185 --> 01:15.485
we can sell our cars

01:15.520 --> 01:17.315
and get most of the thousand dollars back.

01:17.350 --> 01:21.650
It's brilliant. Now, in the holiday we
had stones thrown at us by rednecks.

01:21.685 --> 01:24.150
We crashed into a river full of alligators.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.527
What else happened?

01:25.562 --> 01:26.835
We had to eat a squirrel.

01:26.870 --> 01:29.835
Ah, anyway, the big challenge was:

01:29.870 --> 01:34.520
could we buy a car for less than
it costs to rent one for a fortnight?

01:34.555 --> 01:35.920
Let's find out.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.900
Miami, cloudy sunny, 34 degrees.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.270
Yes, Miami, home to all the most successful drug dealers,

01:48.305 --> 01:50.670
this year's Mr. Big Mac,

01:50.705 --> 01:52.765
and Silicon Valley,

01:52.800 --> 01:55.870
all very glamorous. But our journey began here:

01:56.720 --> 01:58.970
in the city's used-car lots.

01:59.900 --> 02:05.370
This is where we had a morning to find a set
of wheels for less than a thousand dollars.

02:09.850 --> 02:13.970
I think I quite like to take this one for a test drive.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.250
What's under the bonnet of that?

02:17.285 --> 02:18.615
- It's a V6.
- V6?

02:18.650 --> 02:20.750
- Yes.
- Got anything with a V8?

02:21.470 --> 02:26.800
I wanted a muscle car. So I went straight
to a dealership that sells Corvettes.

02:26.835 --> 02:29.354
You got the keys? Thank you.

02:32.057 --> 02:32.959
Oh...

02:33.358 --> 02:36.950
- 400.
- 400 horse power for a 5.7 liter V8?

02:36.951 --> 02:38.351
Ah...

02:39.320 --> 02:41.170
Ok, how much is it?

02:41.205 --> 02:44.470
64,115

02:45.600 --> 02:48.470
si... sixty four?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.715
- thousand dollars?
- Yeah.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.520
What if I gave you 1 thousand dollars for it?

02:55.950 --> 02:57.820
- One thousand?
- Ehm...

03:03.050 --> 03:06.600
Richard it seems was being similarly ambitious.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.965
- How much is this?
- $89,900

03:13.000 --> 03:15.235
I need something a bit, a bit less than that.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.470
- A little bit less than that?
- Less than that.

03:17.505 --> 03:18.815
So how much for a Cougar?

03:18.850 --> 03:22.850
Cougars are anywhere from $35,000 to $200,000.

03:22.885 --> 03:25.350
Depending upon the condition and so on.

03:25.970 --> 03:28.660
I need something that's a bit less than that.

03:28.695 --> 03:31.350
- Less than that?
- How much for a Challenger?

03:31.385 --> 03:35.070
Challenger start at $20,000--$19,900.

03:35.105 --> 03:35.935
Less than that.

03:35.970 --> 03:37.415
- Less than that?
- Less than that.

03:37.450 --> 03:41.175
You see this, here, look, he is turning right on the red light.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.900
That's America's only contribution to Western civilization.

03:44.935 --> 03:47.765
(Radio)

03:47.800 --> 03:51.820
I was the only one using even a modicum of common sense.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.035
Would you take a thousand for this.

03:54.070 --> 03:57.620
OK, Err. That's gonna be a little bit difficult.

03:59.450 --> 04:01.835
Soon I took a leaf out of James's book.

04:01.870 --> 04:07.550
Lowered my sights and quickly found a
tidy Camaro at a place called "Adolf's"

04:08.750 --> 04:13.550
$2,900 this. It's a big ask to get him down to 1000.

04:13.585 --> 04:16.649
May I offer him a burger?

04:18.149 --> 04:20.300
Very popular with murderers these cars.

04:20.334 --> 04:21.000
Yeah.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.720
Meanwhile, I found something we don't have in Britain.

04:26.755 --> 04:30.085
A dealership specializing in ex-government cars.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.800
This would have been the police car. You can tell it by the colour,

04:32.835 --> 04:35.850
a hole for the aerial. And it says "police interceptor" on it.

04:35.885 --> 04:39.565
Now this one was probably, I don't know, maybe a spy?

04:39.600 --> 04:43.650
'Cos there is no badge on there. That could have
been a... man in black and that was a vet manner.

04:43.685 --> 04:46.270
Basically the important thing is:
They've all been properly maintained

04:46.305 --> 04:48.250
and I'm told that they are dirt cheap.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.715
And indeed they were.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.085
But even these were beyond my budget.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.750
I don't have anything right now for a 1000 dollars.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.750
Even sensible James was struggling.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.585
I want a real cold jack, smoking.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.810
- Ah... real cool car hum?
- Yeah.

05:04.845 --> 05:07.000
How about a '99 Honda Civic?

05:09.570 --> 05:14.000
Meanwhile, back at Adolf's, negotiations
on the Camaro had broken down.

05:14.035 --> 05:16.115
Eh, well, it's not going well, mate.

05:16.150 --> 05:21.965
I thought that we'd get here and we'd find all sort
of fantastic old American 80's cars for 300 dollars

05:22.000 --> 05:27.500
I know, I did, I did. I thought we would just be
tripping over Oldsmobiles, Cutlasses and Firebirds.

05:27.535 --> 05:32.150
So it's coz that we are buying that 90's
period when they were just making rubbish.

05:32.185 --> 05:33.915
And I'm looking at a Buick Le Sabre.

05:33.950 --> 05:36.675
- Oh, God, don't.
- It was rubbish when it was new.

05:36.749 --> 05:39.249
It was built by idiots. And it's rubbish now.

05:39.284 --> 05:41.715
I've got... You know we've got one hour left.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.215
And I've reached the bottom end of this town.

05:45.250 --> 05:48.120
Yeah, I wouldn't have the Chinese food
round here. Let's put it that way.

05:51.670 --> 05:55.695
The fact was though, if we were gonna find cars for $1,000,

05:55.730 --> 05:59.720
we'd have to go to a even lower bottom end of the town.

05:59.755 --> 06:02.512
How much murdering happens here?

06:02.547 --> 06:05.270
A lot. If you go one mile away here,

06:05.305 --> 06:06.885
you go to any street.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.215
- I'll be murdered.
- You'll find yourself killed

06:08.250 --> 06:13.920
Yeah. Everybody here, they have guns.
Including me, wanna see it?

06:14.270 --> 06:19.350
- He is not joking!
- It's real, here. 25.

06:19.385 --> 06:21.850
Now you see I wasn't ready for that.

06:21.885 --> 06:24.015
Welcome to United State.

06:24.050 --> 06:28.585
This is his other gun. That's not a
shot gun, Robert. That's a rifle.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.900
Right it's a rifle. The shot gun is somewhere
else. I don't know where it that one.

06:31.935 --> 06:33.885
You need these if you're gonna be a car sellsman.

06:33.920 --> 06:38.700
A guy right here if you go two blocks
down here. He got shot five times.

06:38.735 --> 06:39.870
Why? By someone buying the car?

06:39.905 --> 06:40.950
But he killed the guy.

06:40.985 --> 06:41.715
He killed a...

06:41.750 --> 06:43.515
He killed the guy finally.

06:43.550 --> 06:46.185
So why have you got telescopic sights on it?

06:46.220 --> 06:48.815
Because if they go far away, you just shoot them.

06:48.850 --> 06:54.750
You saw that movie with John Wayne?
A guy running all the way like 500 feet

06:54.785 --> 06:56.900
and 'Pooosh' you shoot him right there.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.785
- Hammond.
- Yes? Jeremy how are you doing?

07:02.820 --> 07:06.465
Just been told by my new best friend, Robert the Persian.

07:06.500 --> 07:13.020
if you go beyond 79 street, you will
definitely be murdered, shot. Good-bye.

07:13.770 --> 07:15.715
Hammond is wearing cowboy boots,

07:15.750 --> 07:17.820
They're gonna shoot him, aren't they?

07:18.600 --> 07:22.300
Is it south or north of 79 street I can't go?

07:23.970 --> 07:28.915
I decided the best plan was to
stay on 79 street itself.

07:28.950 --> 07:34.170
And came across what must be
the most optimistic dealer in town.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.020
Very well, these must.

07:43.470 --> 07:48.170
The lesson we've learned already was that
it was easier to rent a car than buy one.

07:48.205 --> 07:50.000
But we weren't giving up.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.020
Believe me, I'm desperate now. I'm desperate for wheels.

07:55.150 --> 07:57.870
Distressed look on the roof, gun shot holes.

07:57.905 --> 07:59.615
So car's got a history.

07:59.650 --> 08:03.920
It's messedбнoh, no. It's got tree growing out of it.

08:03.955 --> 08:06.535
There's been an accident over there,

08:06.570 --> 08:09.850
but the car's still running. And I was
just wondering if I could make an offer for it.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.335
We've been ambitious here I think.

08:13.370 --> 08:16.370
This $1000 is a low amount of money.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.485
I therefore decided to go beyond
the lower back end of town.

08:22.520 --> 08:26.370
You guys got any ideas where I
can find a car for a thousand dollars?

08:26.405 --> 08:27.335
A thousand dollars?

08:27.370 --> 08:29.400
Kind of cunning. You've got some great teeth

08:29.435 --> 08:33.565
You see these teeth! Haha...

08:33.600 --> 08:36.450
- You want it today?
- It's got to be today.

08:36.485 --> 08:41.065
OK. Alright, let me get back to you.

08:41.100 --> 08:45.920
Go right here to the stop front. Go to
right, go over exactly two blocks...

08:45.955 --> 08:47.150
- Over this way?
- Yeah.

08:51.320 --> 08:57.800
Amazingly the tip paid off. And I was the first
to arrive at our pre-arranged meeting point.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.700
the Miami Jai-Alai Stadium

09:09.220 --> 09:13.635
This is a Chevrolet Camaro, the RS model.

09:13.670 --> 09:19.250
5 liter V8 engine, 5 speed gear box, rear wheel drive

09:19.285 --> 09:21.320
a full-on American muscle car.

09:22.072 --> 09:26.320
Only three previous murderers
and I only paid 800 dollars for it.

09:26.355 --> 09:30.884
I am... It's a brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant find.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.035
Then Hammond turned up.

09:35.907 --> 09:40.420
Oh, dear. He's never been to America
before and now he's bought himself

09:40.455 --> 09:43.000
what he thinks all the Americans have.

09:43.035 --> 09:44.200
That is bluff.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.820
- What do you think?
- I'm /, well.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.170
- It's a Dodge Ram.
- It's terrible.

09:51.205 --> 09:51.985
A dent?

09:52.020 --> 09:54.970
I know, there are a few dents and
a bit's missing. But it's basic.

09:55.005 --> 09:56.970
It's basic motoring in its very best.

09:57.005 --> 09:58.185
You know how Mercedes goes?

09:58.220 --> 10:02.100
It's not a Mercedes. It's not a Mercedes.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.100
- How much?
- A thousand.

10:07.050 --> 10:11.400
That shuts. A thousand? 800.
I'm already 200 dollars ahead of you.

10:11.435 --> 10:12.892
800 dollars?

10:12.927 --> 10:14.315
The RS model.

10:14.350 --> 10:15.465
Was that the basic one?

10:15.500 --> 10:18.450
Of course it wasn't the basic one. RS is rally sport.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.670
I'd ask James on that one when he arrives.

10:20.705 --> 10:22.135
But I'm not entirely sure it was.

10:22.170 --> 10:26.700
It was the RS, the IROC-Z. The RS was the... yes...

10:26.735 --> 10:27.535
Yes the queerest.

10:27.570 --> 10:33.370
I'll keep quiet about it.
Every single thing on it works, nearly.

10:33.405 --> 10:34.815
It's a manual.

10:34.850 --> 10:38.770
Yeah, five on the floor, rear wheel drive,
I've got a muscle car. How many horse power?

10:38.805 --> 10:42.815
- 200 and... 170.
- Oh, rubbish. 190.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.870
How do they get such a small amount
of horse power from a car?

10:46.905 --> 10:50.785
The more pressing question though was where was James?

10:50.820 --> 10:53.470
When he walks into a dealership,
'Hello', and they will shoot him.

10:53.505 --> 10:56.350
Hahaha...

10:57.500 --> 10:59.685
How can it take so long?

10:59.720 --> 11:02.020
Because that's what he does.

11:02.055 --> 11:04.320
And he may have been lost.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.337
Good Grief!

11:08.870 --> 11:13.820
That's Tinanic. No, wait, I changed
my mind. It's an aircraft carrier.

11:13.855 --> 11:15.365
That's really big.

11:15.400 --> 11:20.150
That, gentlemen, is how you do it.
It's a 1989 Cadillac Brougham sedan.

11:20.185 --> 11:21.285
What do you think?

11:21.320 --> 11:23.165
Well, this is terrible.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.035
It's like a long walk round it. It's a really long walk.

11:27.070 --> 11:29.500
- I like that though.
- It doesn't just move up and down, look.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.665
It goes from side to side.

11:31.700 --> 11:36.620
Have you seen the roads around here? That is
a perfect car for the environment. 900 dollars.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.315
And you can see why.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.750
Oh look, well you don't do that, mate.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.315
Oh it's got newspaper in it.

11:44.350 --> 11:46.500
You can date it, find out when it was repaired.

11:46.535 --> 11:48.415
It was a Wednesday.

11:49.206 --> 11:50.715
What size engine does this thing got?

11:50.750 --> 11:53.485
5 liter V8. It's not fast, but it is fabulous.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.185
You don't say it's not fast. Is it not, mate?

11:56.220 --> 11:59.820
I'll tell you when you look at the...
Oh... it's like a Lotus Exige.

11:59.855 --> 12:02.815
James then turned on our cars.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.418
- The wheels are odd.
- No I've got an alloy.

12:05.453 --> 12:08.325
That's my alloy. Check out my alloy.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.350
This just has been made out of bits.

12:10.385 --> 12:14.235
It hasn't. Have you? Ah...

12:14.270 --> 12:17.520
Smells of bodies. Oh, it does smell a bit ripe.

12:17.555 --> 12:18.420
Hold on. This is...

12:19.700 --> 12:22.670
Er. No, that's the clothes of the
last person they killed.

12:22.705 --> 12:24.712
Oh, Jeez.

12:24.747 --> 12:26.685
Oh my.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.965
Oh God, no.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.020
That's the last person the driver killed.

12:33.055 --> 12:34.550
Don't look.

12:35.900 --> 12:38.415
Poor man, tried to get out.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.670
- James and I bought cars.
- Yes

12:41.705 --> 12:43.515
You've bought a pick-up truck.

12:43.550 --> 12:47.770
Now the reason that yours is in better
condition is because it's just a pick-up truck.

12:47.805 --> 12:49.350
It's lovely. I'm delighted with it.

12:49.385 --> 12:50.685
I quite like the pick-up truck.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.770
- Oh, come on. Compared to the Camaro...
- It's the land of the pick-up truck.

12:53.770 --> 12:56.000
- What you don't like the Camaro?
- I don't. I'm sorry I don't.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.020
Well, I do. I mean, one of those in
good nick. Yes. Yours is a dog.

13:00.055 --> 13:02.285
- It isn't.
- It is... Jeremy.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.050
But every one of us has got something better
than you get from a rental desk in an airport.

13:06.085 --> 13:06.850
- Oh, Yeah.
- Oh, Yeah.

13:10.450 --> 13:14.550
To find out how good our cars were. We were told to head to a race track.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.170
90 miles north of Miami.

13:17.685 --> 13:21.615
There we'll be given a seris of challenges.

13:26.870 --> 13:31.135
I'm in a murderer's muscle car, heading through Miami.

13:32.483 --> 13:33.492
Yes

13:33.527 --> 13:38.777
This is brilliant. I love pick-up trucks.

13:38.812 --> 13:44.070
It's a Cadillac. I'm absolutely staggered.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:53.800 --> 13:57.400
I've even got a functioning radio.

13:58.420 --> 14:02.820
Although there is only one station it'll
pick up, which is gospel. Ready?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.192
(Radio)... the people of the holy spirit,
- Yes

14:06.193 --> 14:09.890
(Radio) - Jesus Christ is my lord...
- Yes I agree with you.

14:12.598 --> 14:16.558
(Radio) Temperatures very high today,
we're well into the 90s, near 100.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.715
The mono radio staion however was the tip of an iceberg.

14:22.750 --> 14:27.320
If I'm honest, there are one or two issues with my Camaro.

14:27.355 --> 14:30.165
Ah... the rev counter for example, broken.

14:30.200 --> 14:35.120
Then there is an alarming knocking noise
from the front suspension when it goes over a bump,

14:35.155 --> 14:36.500
or when you are on full lock.

14:38.220 --> 14:41.120
The others too, were finding problems.

14:41.121 --> 14:45.665
Now we're alone you and I, I've got to admit
to one or two very small faults with my Cadillac.

14:45.666 --> 14:49.009
First is that squeak, which is a loose
belt or a belt ring or something.

14:49.107 --> 14:52.749
The other, it is fantastically slow this thing.

14:52.750 --> 14:58.425
I'm doing 55 and I'm putting my foot down.
And I'm really struggling to get it up to 60

15:01.227 --> 15:02.587
If I'm honest,

15:03.242 --> 15:05.431
it does pull a little bit to the right.

15:05.432 --> 15:09.167
And if I brake, it pulls to the left really badly.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.622
I'm right behind Richard Hammond's Dodge Ram,

15:11.623 --> 15:15.020
but I just noticed for the first time
that the body doesn't line up...

15:17.439 --> 15:19.204
... with the wheels quite right.

15:21.193 --> 15:25.927
But the worst problem by a mile is the air-conditioning,

15:25.962 --> 15:30.363
which, as you can probably see from the
state of my shirt, is broken

15:31.659 --> 15:35.763
92% humidity. Ha... No air-con.

15:35.764 --> 15:40.393
The only consolation I have is that Hammond's
air-conditioning doesn't work either.

15:40.924 --> 15:44.167
Apart from the air-conditioning
not working, it's pretty much perfect.

15:44.202 --> 15:47.400
For the first time I've got a radio on one of these trips.

15:56.592 --> 15:59.279
But enough of the car's little foibles.

15:59.314 --> 16:04.272
It was time to settle down and enjoy our
journey across the Sunshine State.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.342
God, Florida's awful!

16:11.553 --> 16:15.750
Nasty insects, old people, fat people,

16:15.785 --> 16:21.072
a lot of people who all offer you cheese: 'you
want cheese with that? You want cheese with that'?

16:21.107 --> 16:23.135
And they'll shoot you.

16:30.429 --> 16:34.871
While Hammond roasted, James remained smug and cool.

16:34.906 --> 16:39.581
It's get a bit of parky actually. I think I'll
just turn the temperature up very slightly.

16:43.581 --> 16:47.111
Look, I'm Burt Reynolds, I'm the Bandit.

16:54.507 --> 16:57.293
Eventually, we turned off the high way.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.818
And arrived at the race track.

17:02.873 --> 17:06.583
The Moroso Motorsports Park is unusual in the America.

17:06.759 --> 17:11.976
Because it has left-handed turns,
and some which go right as well.

17:13.057 --> 17:16.458
Perhaps that's why it was deserted:
too complicated for the colonials.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.549
Or maybe everyone had been murdered.

17:20.167 --> 17:24.292
Whatever. It was time for our first challenge.

17:24.537 --> 17:28.297
It says here that each of our cars
must complete one lap of the track.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.067
The target is 1 minute 10 seconds

17:30.102 --> 17:34.335
Get points for every second under that time,
and you lose points for every second over it.

17:34.336 --> 17:36.250
Yeah, but the thing is none of us has ever seen that track.

17:36.251 --> 17:37.249
Yes, that's gonna be tricky.

17:37.284 --> 17:39.192
- We're not driving.
- Well who is?

17:39.853 --> 17:45.757
Some say that he's a C.I.A. experiment that
went wrong, and that he only eats cheese.

17:45.758 --> 17:51.296
All we know is, he's not the Stig.
But he is the Stig's American cousin!

17:54.203 --> 17:54.871
Woo!

17:59.700 --> 18:01.753
- Big Stig!
- Hahaha...

18:05.445 --> 18:09.009
First, he squeezed himself into my Camaro.

18:09.243 --> 18:14.325
One, Two, Three, Go!

18:14.969 --> 18:18.852
Hahaha... I was expecting: 'Rarara... '

18:22.224 --> 18:25.934
- Nought to 60 in 7.9 seconds.
- Yeah, once.

18:27.602 --> 18:31.049
- Can do 110 and he is doing that now!
- And no more.

18:31.294 --> 18:33.641
- It's limited. It's electronically limited.
- No.

18:33.641 --> 18:37.325
It's just naturally limited to 110 'cos it's rubbish.

18:43.264 --> 18:45.955
Lean that weight in there Big Stig.

18:46.134 --> 18:50.662
Here it goes. 1 minutes 9 seconds on our Top Stopwatch.

18:50.822 --> 18:52.801
- Is that good?
- We don't know, do we?

18:52.822 --> 18:55.690
What we did know was that the Pipmobile was next.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.968
- I'm gonna need a calendar for this. Not a stopwatch.
- Yeah.

18:58.969 --> 19:00.433
- You got a diary?
- I might...

19:00.434 --> 19:03.428
I'm gonna hold this stone and as it's eroded by the wind

19:03.463 --> 19:05.607
That'll give us an idea of how long he has been.

19:05.608 --> 19:07.218
Air-con, max.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.268
Oh, cock.

19:14.268 --> 19:16.422
Hahaha...

19:16.817 --> 19:19.072
- It's broken, isn't it?
- It's run out of electricity.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.355
To raise the Titanic, we borrowed a battery booster.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.154
Is that for starting your watch while it stopped.

19:26.757 --> 19:28.673
- Oh, it's begun.
- Oh, it's very good.

19:28.773 --> 19:32.331
One, Two, Three, go!

19:32.492 --> 19:34.925
- Hahaha...
- It's moved off.

19:34.926 --> 19:37.265
It's still moving off.

19:46.336 --> 19:47.636
24 days.

19:50.695 --> 19:52.001
I'm getting older.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.716
Hey, look, it's fabulous. Come on, admit it.

19:58.751 --> 20:00.285
Well, we've got plenty of time to admire it.

20:03.534 --> 20:08.176
The Cadillac certainly seemed to suit
Big Stig's relaxed driving style.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.192
- Hahaha...
- On the grass!

20:14.193 --> 20:18.968
But would the match made in Heaven be able to beat the Camaro's 1:09?

20:19.844 --> 20:20.767
Yeah!

20:20.767 --> 20:22.673
- Go on.
- One minute fourteen.

20:22.836 --> 20:25.824
So now it's all down to Hammond's hillbilly-mobile.

20:25.859 --> 20:27.384
- One, two, three, go!
- Let it rock, Yeah!

20:28.356 --> 20:29.440
Oh, nice. Haha.

20:29.512 --> 20:31.637
- Is that manual?
- It sounds very... Yeah.

20:31.672 --> 20:33.878
Stick shift, four on the floor with overdrive.

20:35.909 --> 20:38.639
Actually it all looked pretty promising.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.628
This beats mine I'm gonna have to kill you.

20:40.629 --> 20:43.434
And I am in a Camaro, so don't think that won't happen.

20:46.435 --> 20:48.723
Oh, it's a proud and noble thing.

20:51.665 --> 20:54.915
You've seen Brokeback Mountain and thought:
'I want a piece of that life. '

20:54.916 --> 20:57.355
Not that piece, I'll have the pick-up truck.

20:59.153 --> 21:04.566
Although the truck had started well, in the
last few tight corners it was rubbish.

21:04.903 --> 21:07.226
Have you seen that my alloy dancing in the sun.

21:08.243 --> 21:10.040
- Where were you? 1:14?
- Yeah.

21:10.075 --> 21:13.697
- 12:13, 1:14, Yes!
- No it can't be... No!

21:13.698 --> 21:17.038
- How can that happen?
- 1:16.9.

21:17.039 --> 21:20.005
I think that's more to do with
the Stig being too big to get...

21:23.081 --> 21:25.001
He didn't make the turn.

21:25.898 --> 21:28.282
Fat Stig's work was done.

21:29.726 --> 21:33.075
And so it was time for the next challenge.

21:33.650 --> 21:37.047
You must each accelerate your car to 50 mph,

21:37.048 --> 21:40.433
when you reach 50 mph you must brake as hard as you can.

21:40.434 --> 21:43.731
So this is a test of acceleration and braking all together?

21:43.732 --> 21:46.312
Yes, you must brake before the end of the track.

21:46.411 --> 21:48.926
At the end of the track, there is a river...

21:49.255 --> 21:50.313
That's no big deal.

21:50.663 --> 21:52.230
... full of alligators.

21:52.824 --> 21:55.157
And that wasn't a missprint.

21:56.273 --> 22:00.643
I should explain. That is the track. So
if you look out there, OK? There it is. OK?

22:00.644 --> 22:04.304
And here, this is alligator infested.

22:05.503 --> 22:07.672
There's another one.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.709
We drew hot dogs, and mine was the shortest.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.861
I hope he doesn't die at the end.

22:14.011 --> 22:17.922
It's salt-water crocodiles you need to worry about, I think.

22:17.957 --> 22:20.615
Oh, no. I hope he doesn't go in the river. That'd be awful.

22:20.650 --> 22:23.800
Here we go, the hell with the clucks.

22:24.230 --> 22:25.209
Spirited start.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.354
Come on. 30, I don't wanna be eaten by an alligator.

22:29.272 --> 22:35.505
35, 40, 45, it's 50!

22:40.246 --> 22:44.387
- That's doubly disappointing. No. 1, he is not dead.
- Yeah.

22:44.422 --> 22:49.433
And No. 2 the fastest accelerating car
here only just stopped before the grass.

22:49.930 --> 22:55.924
Surely though, the Huggy Bear-mobile would
struggle to do 0 to 50 to 0 in the distance.

23:00.228 --> 23:02.452
- That is movement.
- Oh, come on car!

23:04.208 --> 23:07.438
Come on, come on, come on, I'm nearly there!

23:07.438 --> 23:08.895
Break!

23:13.375 --> 23:15.673
Strewth, I'm worried.

23:15.814 --> 23:21.154
I should imagine he's clenched in there...
8 tons of Caddy.

23:22.464 --> 23:23.931
I was really nervious.

23:23.931 --> 23:28.989
I'd just seen Big Stig try to stop
my truck, and fail completely.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.450
We're away, 20...

23:33.286 --> 23:35.659
Here he comes to a certain death!

23:35.731 --> 23:40.033
40. 45. Takes ages...

23:40.034 --> 23:41.138
Oh, my God.

23:41.491 --> 23:42.806
- God
- Oh, my.

23:46.278 --> 23:48.444
Haha... That is quite funny.

23:49.218 --> 23:51.968
- Hammond, alligators, mate.
- Are you alive?

23:52.530 --> 23:57.119
Yeah, I suggest we may have made them angry.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.223
We have just driven in their...hahaha... into the living room.

24:00.224 --> 24:02.263
Such an insufferarable oaf.

24:02.264 --> 24:04.402
Oh, there is my pickup, look!

24:04.403 --> 24:08.738
The cars had survived their ordeal by track, just.

24:11.282 --> 24:13.920
But the next morning, the real test began.

24:17.157 --> 24:22.308
A sweltering 800-mile road trip to New Orleans.

24:28.315 --> 24:34.488
Today, probably cloudy, high sun all over 90's,
chance of thunderstorms 30%

24:36.172 --> 24:38.079
Things started badly.

24:46.239 --> 24:48.551
- Has it got petrol in it?
- Yeah, look it's full.

24:48.552 --> 24:52.860
Well, yeah, but has it got petrol in it? It could be broken.

24:52.895 --> 24:58.176
- When did you last put petrol in it?
- Erm... Miami.

24:58.211 --> 25:02.496
- Now you come to mention it.
- You stupid man.

25:02.496 --> 25:05.655
It's a 5 liter V8! See you then.

25:05.766 --> 25:09.648
The car was fine. What's happened is... Hahaha.

25:09.649 --> 25:11.392
Mine ran out of electricity again.

25:11.393 --> 25:12.888
You're joking.

25:12.889 --> 25:15.449
Can I borrow your van and your jump leads?

25:15.484 --> 25:18.811
See how prepared we are on this sh... show.

25:20.279 --> 25:22.713
You have the err.. leads in your car.

25:22.748 --> 25:24.414
No, no, you have the leads.

25:24.415 --> 25:26.773
I'm not stupid, man!?

25:28.021 --> 25:31.829
I've got a door panel, some bolts, and that's it.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.354
What's the matter?

25:33.355 --> 25:36.619
- He's lost the Jump Leads...
- He's lost the Jump Leads, HE has lost the Jump Leads...

25:36.849 --> 25:39.286
This isn't going well is it?

25:40.555 --> 25:42.956
If you're thinking of coming to
America this is what it's like:

25:43.028 --> 25:46.914
you got your Comfort Inn; you got your Best
Western; you got your Red Lobster where you eat.

25:47.443 --> 25:51.325
Everybody's very fat, everybody's very
stupid and everybody's very rude.

25:53.654 --> 25:56.262
It's not the Holiday programme - it's the truth.

25:57.349 --> 26:01.906
Eventually the leads were found and Hammond
positioned himself for the jump start.

26:01.907 --> 26:05.685
- No it's not funny.
- Hahaha...

26:08.567 --> 26:09.758
We're off!

26:09.793 --> 26:11.814
I'm sweating already.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.433
Yes, I'm not going be to for much longer.

26:13.433 --> 26:15.859
It's not a sunny day, It's just a humid day this day.

26:15.894 --> 26:17.517
You know what this is?

26:17.552 --> 26:18.986
Tropical.

26:19.021 --> 26:21.318
No, that's the approach of a cold front.

26:21.319 --> 26:23.859
That's tall cumulonimbus with a high...

26:31.020 --> 26:34.602
It's bigger than you expect. You don't feel like...

26:43.263 --> 26:45.798
I'd love to know what Hammond thinks he looks like.

26:45.799 --> 26:49.721
Chewing gum, his aviators, his cowboy hat, his pickup truck.

26:53.052 --> 26:58.927
To help relieve the tedium of the journey, the
production office had provided us with C.B. Radios

26:58.928 --> 27:02.110
And for those, we needed appropriate call signs

27:02.111 --> 27:05.198
Brokeback, Brokeback, this is Murderer.

27:07.021 --> 27:09.461
This is Brokeback, to Murderer and Captain that...

27:09.462 --> 27:13.073
!@#$%^&

27:13.173 --> 27:16.843
No wonder these C.B. Radios never caught on.

27:16.844 --> 27:21.325
Break break one nine contact eye ball ten
ten, should we do it again? Captain Slow.

27:21.326 --> 27:24.117
!@#$%^&

27:24.118 --> 27:27.757
There, he is there and I can't understand him.

27:29.153 --> 27:32.572
This was hopeless. So we changed channals.

27:32.941 --> 27:35.108
Hello, I'm on 22, are you there?

27:35.109 --> 27:37.816
- Yooo, big boy!
- Hahaha...

27:38.164 --> 27:41.232
And finally made contact with a native.

27:43.332 --> 27:44.980
That's him in that truck!

27:47.964 --> 27:51.131
He is asking...

27:51.132 --> 27:56.120
He's asking another lorry driver where
he might find a lady friend for the afternoon.

27:57.450 --> 28:02.744
All they've got to talk about on that
C.B. is the weather, and prostitutes.

28:02.779 --> 28:07.792
Yeah, It's raining, ah, I'm going north, and I'm looking for a whore.

28:11.002 --> 28:15.760
As we headed northwest, the heat and humidity became unbearable.

28:19.187 --> 28:21.568
You are sitting there, in the winter,

28:21.569 --> 28:26.352
you can't imagine what it's like to be in a
non-airconditioned car in Florida now.

28:26.353 --> 28:28.086
It's so hot!

28:29.964 --> 28:31.867
(Radio) Danger persists in the hot West.

28:31.867 --> 28:36.960
(Radio) Even if almost a quarter of the fire is contained,
much of it is still burning out of control.

28:38.785 --> 28:42.354
Only the insufferable May wasn't suffering.

28:42.950 --> 28:47.159
Chaps it's May here, just to let you know
that my air-conditioning is working very nicely.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.053
it's 69 degrees Fahrenheit

28:49.054 --> 28:50.676
Yes, alright.

28:50.677 --> 28:55.270
But then the smile was wiped from his face, again.

29:01.971 --> 29:03.679
I brought you some presents.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.810
I've got you steak and cheese biscuit.

29:06.971 --> 29:07.504
What?

29:07.505 --> 29:10.534
- I bought you a fan.
- really?

29:10.535 --> 29:13.390
- Yeah, we've got fans. How do you feel now?
- That's fantastic, mate.

29:13.391 --> 29:15.767
Yeah, air-con, there it is.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.575
See what I've got.

29:19.576 --> 29:21.008
- Harman cheese?
- Yeah.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.105
Dandy Harman Cheese, original ingredients, blablabla...

29:24.106 --> 29:27.024
And, imitation American cheese.

29:27.025 --> 29:29.315
So is there anything that hasn't actually got any cheese on this?

29:29.910 --> 29:35.116
After our imitation American lunch,
it was my turn to help restart the Cadillac.

29:38.538 --> 29:39.447
Oh, yes!

29:45.210 --> 29:47.044
Oh I'm back in the sweat box.

29:55.756 --> 30:00.248
Now what that is doing is just turbo charging warm air into my face.

30:14.915 --> 30:20.805
Nice bit. Jeremy, this is Brokeback, did you cut the wire?

30:26.319 --> 30:30.282
(Radio) You want your man to look good,
but words like 'ex-foliant' scare him?

30:35.724 --> 30:39.796
The miles passed with the Cadillac endlessly breaking down.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.125
- Have you got the leads?
- No, you've got the leads.

30:44.126 --> 30:46.230
(Radio) ...on my first qualify while it sounds a little modest...

30:46.769 --> 30:50.750
Still, thanks to the automatic windscreen
washers at Florida Service Stations

30:51.310 --> 30:52.445
No, no!

30:52.446 --> 30:57.407
Hammond and I could at least enjoy some refreshing
showers, while he got it going again.

31:01.306 --> 31:04.591
The Cadillac, however, was not the only trouble maker.

31:05.155 --> 31:09.669
After just 200 miles my Camaro was hardly tiptop, either.

31:11.427 --> 31:17.333
Right, sit-rep on the Camaro, some of the headlights
are working, the dashboard's come off,

31:17.368 --> 31:22.650
all the dials are broken, one radio speaker
remains, however, and it's good!

31:24.698 --> 31:28.060
(radio) Good news is that with God's help we can stop Global Warming.

31:28.934 --> 31:35.342
(Radio) In a world where the tails stop wagging,
sticks don't get fetched and chew toys stay dry,

31:35.343 --> 31:37.643
(Radio) one man dares to step forward and declare:

31:37.842 --> 31:40.680
(Radio) I can get to the root of your dog's depression.

31:44.589 --> 31:49.974
Eventually, our Top Gear fly-drive holiday
convoy reached the 300 mile mark.

31:50.785 --> 31:54.626
And as a reward, the production office gave each of us $100

31:54.626 --> 31:59.295
to buy an accessory that might in some way make our journey less arduous.

32:00.958 --> 32:05.532
Hoping and praying that James had bought a new
battery for his stupid Cadillac,

32:05.533 --> 32:08.385
We all met up to show off our new toys.

32:08.386 --> 32:09.847
A trailer?

32:09.848 --> 32:12.413
No, a Freedom Grill 500.

32:12.414 --> 32:13.414
A grilling system?

32:13.415 --> 32:15.745
- It's a grilling system.
- What is it?

32:17.197 --> 32:20.859
- I have been...no way!
- No.

32:21.056 --> 32:26.011
Look at that. Drop tail gate, cooking
platform, what do you think?

32:26.012 --> 32:31.719
Gordon Ramsey hasn't got anything like that in
his kitchen. You got anything that good James?

32:32.045 --> 32:32.738
No.

32:32.739 --> 32:36.822
Right, I got a clothes rack.

32:36.823 --> 32:40.209
- What?
- Look at my perfectly pressed linen jacket.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.498
- He has a linen jacket on the clothes...
- He has got...
- Don't wobble it.

32:42.499 --> 32:48.969
Ok, you step into your car. And here if you look, is a shower.

32:48.970 --> 32:50.867
- In your car?
- Yeah.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.772
Where do you get the water from then?

32:52.773 --> 32:55.398
It comes from the cool box in the back, it's tuned.

32:55.399 --> 33:00.900
And then you just plug this into the cigarette
lighter, hit that button, refreshing shower.

33:00.900 --> 33:02.266
I bet you're all jealous.

33:04.580 --> 33:10.161
Sadly though our dreams of luxury living
were shattered when we received the next challenge

33:11.245 --> 33:13.629
Tonight, you will be camping.

33:13.630 --> 33:15.089
- What?
- I know.

33:15.090 --> 33:20.428
And you're only allowed to eat what you find dead at the side of the road.

33:20.429 --> 33:22.889
What? You mean road kill?

33:22.890 --> 33:24.733
Yeah, you're only allowed...it's on the... yeah.

33:24.734 --> 33:27.656
It says animals that we find by the side of the road, dead.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.093
Yeah, that's our supper.

33:29.094 --> 33:33.420
Hey, just think about it: you can prepare the food, like for cooking wash it.

33:33.421 --> 33:35.880
I can then cook it. James can dress for dinner.

33:38.667 --> 33:43.070
...these potatos, tomatos, it's lightened up.
I can see that, so let me ask you,

33:43.071 --> 33:45.845
how high should a pineapple bounce when it's ripe?

33:46.965 --> 33:53.445
OK, sit-rep, the power steering pump really is on its last legs,

33:53.446 --> 33:55.781
I've got a terrible wheel wobble.

33:56.853 --> 34:02.755
Er... but I'm cool for the first time
since I set off. I am cool now!

34:04.727 --> 34:09.949
To increase our chances of finding some road kill,
we swapped the interstate for smaller roads.

34:12.568 --> 34:15.132
And very quickly, we got lucky.

34:16.112 --> 34:17.192
On the right, what's that?

34:20.822 --> 34:23.786
You know what, I... I don't fancy it.

34:28.436 --> 34:33.713
No matter though, because further down the
road I came across a fresh and tasty possum.

34:33.714 --> 34:35.168
But then...

34:35.168 --> 34:40.475
James don't ran over it you stupid...!
You blithering idiot, you just ran over it.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.616
That's not edible now, is it?

34:45.237 --> 34:48.603
For flattening our supper, James was punished.

35:00.348 --> 35:05.079
Eventually, we did find fresh meat,
but it was a bit too fresh.

35:06.766 --> 35:10.180
- I thought you were gonna run it over.
- No, even I wouldn't do that.

35:11.851 --> 35:14.792
Errr...Don't do that tortoise.

35:14.793 --> 35:17.690
How can you have wild...there is no wild tortoises.

35:17.691 --> 35:19.048
Well, they're gonna be somewhere.

35:19.049 --> 35:20.867
He's escaped from some eight-year-old girl and...

35:20.868 --> 35:24.228
How does a tortoise escape? Come back, come back!

35:25.741 --> 35:28.489
Finally though, 10 miles down the road.

35:28.490 --> 35:29.707
We've got dinner!

35:31.941 --> 35:34.266
- Squirrel.
- Check that out!

35:34.708 --> 35:38.049
I think that with a bit of cheese will be delicious.

35:42.502 --> 35:45.783
I never told you about my vegetarianism, did I?

35:49.751 --> 35:53.690
Soon, we were near the field where
we would be camping for the night.

35:53.869 --> 35:54.691
Right now.

35:55.651 --> 36:01.845
Sun's going down, with my mates, it's down below 90 degrees,

36:01.846 --> 36:06.776
we're in the deep south, it's a pleasant evening.

36:06.777 --> 36:08.695
This is nice.

36:16.935 --> 36:22.024
But we still only had a squirrel for dinner, so I peeled off for one last forage

36:22.025 --> 36:25.166
while the others went ahead to set up camp.

36:27.662 --> 36:28.610
Sorry.

36:29.142 --> 36:30.426
Right, we've got work to do.

36:31.344 --> 36:35.896
Begin, squirrel on the rack, and then maybe... here is my plan:

36:35.897 --> 36:39.594
with a few herbs, garnished, something like that.

36:40.178 --> 36:42.441
Em... I'm thinking if I cook it once,

36:43.646 --> 36:48.509
and then maybe cook it again, so it'll
go like crispy duck, only it's a squirrel.

36:52.497 --> 36:54.442
Is he ever coming back?

36:54.722 --> 36:55.977
We can't just lob it on, can we?

36:55.978 --> 36:59.665
OK, when with a rabbit, you take the head off, you go down the middle.

36:59.666 --> 37:01.698
But all we've got to do with is this tent pick

37:01.761 --> 37:03.351
- Didn't you bring a penknife?
- No.

37:07.374 --> 37:11.610
Time passed and still no sign of Jeremy.

37:12.101 --> 37:15.004
I'm not peeling it, mate. I don't see why I should do it.

37:15.005 --> 37:16.785
- Come on.
- I don't want to peel a squirrel.

37:16.785 --> 37:19.036
- I'm gonna bring a squirrel over to you.
- Is that a car?

37:19.251 --> 37:20.381
Is it Jezza?

37:21.955 --> 37:24.979
James, in all seriousness,

37:25.743 --> 37:28.667
That's ... what?!

37:30.811 --> 37:33.212
You have got to be...

37:44.738 --> 37:46.582
It's a flaming cow, mate.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.803
- Main course.
- Yeah.

37:59.804 --> 38:02.863
I'm thinking how long have I've been in the sun putting the tent up.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.590
- Why?
- Because, what I'm seeing, heha, you'll love it.

38:06.591 --> 38:08.652
Is a cow on the roof of your Camaro.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.341
It is, isn't it? That is a cow on there.

38:11.342 --> 38:13.303
I don't want to be pedantic, but is it a road kill?

38:13.593 --> 38:15.327
Well you're suggesting I ran it down?

38:15.328 --> 38:17.343
- Well...
- Check out the front of my car.

38:17.344 --> 38:19.571
I had to find someone to help me getting it on there.

38:19.572 --> 38:24.462
But I didn't ran it down. It was at the side of the
road, and now it's on the roof, and now it's our supper.

38:24.497 --> 38:25.831
Do you know what to do with it?

38:25.832 --> 38:26.806
Well, we gotta...

38:26.807 --> 38:29.544
Peel it. I'm not peeling that.

38:31.036 --> 38:33.993
First though, we had to get it off the roof.

38:33.994 --> 38:36.866
What if I go round a corner quite quickly, backwards?

38:36.867 --> 38:40.053
- If I reverse.
- Em... Left hand down, yeah.

38:40.054 --> 38:42.653
Left hand down, it'll roll over that way, do we think?

38:42.654 --> 38:43.852
I reckon it's just good to go.

38:47.217 --> 38:48.892
Yes, there you go!

38:49.731 --> 38:51.546
- Hey, Jeremy.
- What?

38:51.547 --> 38:54.678
I'm better, I can't see a cow on the roof of your Camaro anymore.

38:54.679 --> 38:55.777
- I've done.
- I'm not hungry.

38:55.778 --> 38:57.951
- What?
- I'm not hungry.

38:58.603 --> 38:59.501
You son...

39:00.087 --> 39:02.058
It stinks, Jeremy.

39:05.687 --> 39:09.446
That night, Brokeback and I feasted on beef and squirrel.

39:09.807 --> 39:16.951
And then with May in bed, we decided it would be better for
all of us if the air-conditioning in his car were to break.

39:28.571 --> 39:29.352
- Shh...
- OK.

39:29.353 --> 39:30.575
Sorry.

39:32.398 --> 39:34.142
Why don't we just hit it with a hammer?

39:37.305 --> 39:39.089
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.

39:43.417 --> 39:45.962
They really built it on buses. It's ridiculous!

39:45.962 --> 39:47.224
That's come off. Hehehe...

39:49.123 --> 39:51.232
I'm just hitting it with a spatula.

39:51.232 --> 39:53.405
Another mosquito's bit my face.

39:53.406 --> 39:54.659
It's not working, isn't...?

40:05.128 --> 40:06.712
He is gonna notice, isn't he?

40:13.341 --> 40:17.904
Another humid day dawned and now May knew what it felt like.

40:18.982 --> 40:29.318
Those pathetic, lager swilling, barbequing, redneck thugs
that I call my co-presenters have vandalised my car.

40:33.287 --> 40:37.002
I have had to make a few modifications to car on...

40:37.003 --> 40:43.577
this morning, because of the cow incident I lost the aerial.
So now I've got an i-station instead.

40:43.578 --> 40:47.578
And that teemed with a fan means I really can't see where I'm going.

40:47.579 --> 40:52.743
Also, because some cow did get into the car,
I'm using air fresheners to cover up the smell

40:52.743 --> 40:54.730
So I can't really see where I've been.

40:55.480 --> 41:01.955
Oh, and the passenger seat, I've got lots of cow juice
on it, so it's now at the back of Hammond's truck.

41:06.021 --> 41:11.082
(radio) At this afternoon, skys will be considerably
cloudy, with showers and thunderstorms likely.

41:11.082 --> 41:14.343
Northeast winds, 5 to 10 miles per hour.

41:14.957 --> 41:18.573
Come on. Alabama's only 40 miles now.

41:20.531 --> 41:27.426
Our scrapyard cars had covered 650 miles and
inevitably they were becoming more than just metal.

41:27.570 --> 41:32.035
This whole thing now really sums up why I love cars.

41:32.070 --> 41:37.900
Now you take this Camaro, the dash is more
plastic than an American newsreader,

41:37.935 --> 41:39.985
the engine's got less power than Belgium,

41:40.020 --> 41:44.000
the suspension is softer than journalism in an
in-flight magazine,

41:44.035 --> 41:47.220
and of course it reeks of cow.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.015
But, I adore it.

41:49.050 --> 41:52.915
because you can just sense it wants to keep going.

41:52.950 --> 41:57.250
And I bet James is exactly the same there in the Cadillac.

41:57.285 --> 42:00.620
I bet he is having exactly the same emotions.

42:01.450 --> 42:05.350
I'd rather be in this now than an Enzo. And I'm not joking.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.077
But before we entered Alabama, we have to go to
Bagdad for our next challenge.

42:18.750 --> 42:22.115
This is it. We're in Bagdad.

42:22.150 --> 42:26.600
Not a place I was expecting to visit on this trip.

42:43.221 --> 42:44.817
Challenge time.

42:44.850 --> 42:48.065
Lose 5 pounds in 1 hour.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.469
Yep, sweat it away.

42:49.504 --> 42:50.670
Come on then.

42:50.705 --> 42:52.265
No.

42:52.300 --> 42:59.020
OK. It says here we must not be shot or arrested
as we drive across the proud state of Alabama.

42:59.055 --> 43:04.620
But we will get bonus points if we can get
one of the others shot or arrested.

43:04.655 --> 43:07.165
I don't understand. How do we do that?

43:07.200 --> 43:13.070
You will therefore decorate one another's cars
in such a way to draw maximum attention to yourself in this

43:13.070 --> 43:16.750
Bible-bashing, redneck, deeply Christian
part of the Union.

43:16.785 --> 43:18.235
Decorate?

43:18.270 --> 43:22.770
I think what it means is we each have to write
slogans on the other one's car, so you...

43:22.805 --> 43:24.027
to get them killed?

43:24.062 --> 43:25.215
- Yeah, so...
- Alright?

43:25.250 --> 43:28.470
You do Hammond's. Take it away into the bushes. You do...

43:28.505 --> 43:29.385
I'll do yours, I'm getting you killed.

43:29.472 --> 43:31.263
- I've got an idea.
- Well, come on.

43:35.100 --> 43:41.135
The south, the south. It is Christian,
short hair, they don't like Communists.

43:41.170 --> 43:45.447
What is closest to their heart. I gotta get him
killed. This is once-in-a-life oppotunity.

43:45.447 --> 43:47.971
I (won't) be letting you down, me down, everybody down.

43:51.870 --> 43:55.545
Revenge for all those height cacks.
Every time he's called me Hamster.

43:55.580 --> 43:59.220
This is for every time you've been late and lost.

43:59.255 --> 44:01.700
Can you tell what it says yet?

44:10.450 --> 44:12.535
James, I hate you for that.

44:12.570 --> 44:13.835
I really hate you for that.

44:13.870 --> 44:16.735
All the time you drove into the back of my Cadillac.

44:16.770 --> 44:20.629
Do you know, actually, I think honestly
we've all done a good job here

44:20.745 --> 44:25.650
but I do believe that the person most
likely to be shot is indeed Hammond.

44:25.685 --> 44:29.070
- I think the thing done there James is killed your friend.
- Yeah.

44:30.220 --> 44:33.550
Gingerly, we rejoined the open road.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.135
3 religions down here.

44:38.170 --> 44:41.970
George Bush, God, Country and Western.

44:42.005 --> 44:45.820
In that order, ascending order.

44:46.774 --> 44:52.521
'Country and western is rubbish'

44:54.345 --> 44:58.863
'Hillary for president'

44:59.600 --> 45:03.970
I'll be honest. I have felt less conspicuous than this.

45:05.114 --> 45:09.837
'Man-love rules OK'

45:14.420 --> 45:17.350
Here we are. Sweet home Alabama.

45:26.400 --> 45:31.522
They've shot their own sign. What are they gonna do to us.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.015
To understand what Jeremy's actually done to my car,

45:54.050 --> 45:57.770
You have to remember that this is deep Republican territory.

45:57.805 --> 46:02.800
That woman is the arch Democrat. She is the anti-Christ.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.335
It's not just the slogan,

46:05.370 --> 46:11.772
It's the fact that it's painted on
a pickup, symbol of the South, I mean...

46:14.500 --> 46:18.065
And then Jeremy's written on the boot: NASCAR sucks.

46:18.100 --> 46:21.370
That's a type of saloon car racing that is very very big
in this part of the world.

46:21.405 --> 46:22.970
This is where all the drivers come from,

46:23.005 --> 46:24.877
All the building of the cars is done.

46:24.912 --> 46:26.715
All the supporters come from down here.

46:26.750 --> 46:31.870
To say it sucks is a bit like going up
and punching somebody's sainted mother.

46:48.350 --> 46:53.120
We've survived the highway but then
we had to pull into a town for fuel.

46:59.800 --> 47:03.950
Oh, this is really terrifying.

47:11.570 --> 47:17.950
OK. Just, that's diesel.

47:18.735 --> 47:24.400
Listen, listen...The / president. Tha..That's not going down well.

47:25.370 --> 47:29.691
This lady was cross. But not as cross as the garage's owner.

47:29.789 --> 47:31.091
I'll ask you!

47:31.550 --> 47:35.915
Now are you all gay, hooking to see I want it takes your beat up in a hick town?

47:35.950 --> 47:40.100
I'm not gay. I'm married. I've got three children.

47:40.135 --> 47:41.665
No, we are not. No.

47:41.700 --> 47:45.670
We just sort of decorated ours cars in a distinctive manner.

47:45.705 --> 47:49.237
NASCAR sucks. Country and western is rubbish.

47:49.272 --> 47:51.370
Guess what you are on a hick town, man.

47:51.405 --> 47:52.550
We are gonna die now.

47:52.550 --> 47:55.015
- That's it.
- Don't you dare...

47:55.050 --> 47:58.700
She said she was gonna get the boys.

47:58.735 --> 48:00.900
So we decided to scarper.

48:02.450 --> 48:05.650
I've just remembered I've actually got loads of petrol.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.360
And then, of all the moments,

48:12.395 --> 48:14.700
- Oy, Jump leads.
- You're joking.

48:14.735 --> 48:16.970
- Jump leads.
- Not now!

48:22.100 --> 48:24.200
This is gonna be the quickest jump in history.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.500
Very well, you get the leads I'll start it.

48:27.187 --> 48:30.670
Tell your friend to reject off my parking, I'm getting more people.

48:30.671 --> 48:32.050
The rednecks arrived.

48:33.150 --> 48:35.570
We just got a slight problem here.

48:38.470 --> 48:39.770
This is bad.

48:40.650 --> 48:42.600
Then they turned on the film crews.

48:49.820 --> 48:52.779
Rocks started pelting our vans.

48:53.935 --> 48:56.362
Go! Get out of here!

48:57.100 --> 48:58.670
What's happening?

49:09.270 --> 49:14.100
For the next few moments our TV program became a radio showing.

49:15.884 --> 49:18.292
They're with pick-up trucks.

49:18.327 --> 49:22.450
Can you put your foot down, I think we've got
a load of them on our tail.

49:24.486 --> 49:25.915
Something is going on here.

49:25.950 --> 49:31.170
I'm telling you because these strange trucks that were
in the petrol station have now just torn past us.

49:31.205 --> 49:34.670
We need to get these slogans all flushed.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.350
Pull over, pull over.

49:41.750 --> 49:43.535
Get the other side

49:45.105 --> 49:47.350
Got anything to wipe it off with now?

49:50.655 --> 49:51.718
- There.
- Got it!

49:53.500 --> 49:57.400
With the artwork gone, we hit the road, hard.

50:00.550 --> 50:02.800
Now I'm doing something I never thought I do.

50:02.835 --> 50:04.935
I'm running for the border.

50:04.970 --> 50:07.900
God, I never know that was actually frightening.

50:09.069 --> 50:11.235
They could have killed us.

50:11.270 --> 50:13.965
They really do have an irony deficiency.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.770
I honestly believe that in certain parts of America now,
people have started to mate with vegetables.

50:19.805 --> 50:24.770
And then with one problem behind us,
we ran straight into another.

50:26.095 --> 50:28.137
God! Lightning!

50:28.650 --> 50:31.664
You hear? This is God punishing us.

50:32.001 --> 50:32.754
I'm just...

50:35.070 --> 50:37.320
Did you hear that?

50:42.000 --> 50:47.070
It was a great time to discover that the wipers in
my car were worse than useless.

50:47.105 --> 50:49.970
This is like something out of a horror film now.

50:53.570 --> 50:57.965
I'm in serious trouble, I cannot see a damn thing.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.300
There were no exits and stopping on the hard shoulder
in rain like this would have been suicidal,

51:03.335 --> 51:05.885
so there was only one choice.

51:06.917 --> 51:08.150
You're on the lane. Go right Jeremy.

51:08.185 --> 51:12.020
Yep, now, this is very bad.

51:13.061 --> 51:13.815
Left a bit...

51:14.709 --> 51:18.170
Please stop raining, please stop raining, please stop raining.

51:18.205 --> 51:20.098
You're on the lane. Go right.

51:20.098 --> 51:22.320
I think I am just gonna get out and kill myself,

51:22.355 --> 51:24.370
put myself out of misery

51:24.405 --> 51:27.050
God, help us. It's me.

51:37.320 --> 51:43.120
What with the storm and the rock-throwing rednecks,
our fly-drive holiday wasn't going that well.

51:43.155 --> 51:47.550
I just wanted to get on the big British jet and go home.

51:50.300 --> 51:52.765
I want to be met by a...

51:52.800 --> 51:57.670
homosexual in gray flannel trousers saying: "welcome
onboard Mr. Clarkson, can I get you a scull?"

52:02.750 --> 52:06.850
111 miles till New Orleans. Come on, Camaro.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.420
Yes, that's it. We're in Louisiana.

52:16.100 --> 52:20.050
All we had to do was get there and sell our cars.

52:34.220 --> 52:38.300
And that, actually, would be quite a sad moment.

52:38.335 --> 52:42.000
I love my Cadillac.

52:42.950 --> 52:44.665
I mean, we've known each other like what?

52:44.700 --> 52:49.120
A few days and we've had this fantastic
adventure to get all across America.

52:49.120 --> 52:52.215
And it's my car now, and there are always foibles.

52:52.250 --> 52:56.200
It's not the biggest truck, it's not the fastest, not best looking,

52:56.235 --> 52:59.800
but it just keeps going, it is like a little Welsh pony.

52:59.835 --> 53:01.500
I respect that.

53:02.070 --> 53:04.585
This car really is like living in an old house.

53:04.620 --> 53:08.585
You know to keep the backdoor in a certain way to make it open.

53:08.620 --> 53:12.070
This is the same with this. I know how to keep the power steering going.

53:12.105 --> 53:15.670
I know how to get the best out of what's left of the clutch.

53:15.705 --> 53:18.820
I liked it as a kind of joke when we started but now,

53:18.855 --> 53:21.520
we're like... we're like that.

53:31.220 --> 53:35.150
Of course, there were certain other
problems with selling our cars.

53:35.185 --> 53:40.101
This very very bad Cadillac weave going along
this, straight stretch,

53:40.101 --> 53:42.139
so I'll keep my worry beads to hand...

53:44.070 --> 53:45.122
Relax.

53:53.100 --> 53:57.120
We're in New Orleans and something has come off the Camaro.

53:58.870 --> 54:02.050
Temperature gauge is off the scale. Come on!

54:02.085 --> 54:04.770
Finally though, we made it.

54:09.850 --> 54:12.670
And my word were we in for a shock.

54:17.050 --> 54:20.985
We had seen on the news what Hurricane Katrina had done.

54:21.020 --> 54:24.920
But seeing the devastation for real was truly astonishing.

54:24.955 --> 54:26.200
Oh my God!

54:30.370 --> 54:32.165
Oh, look at that.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.935
Well now, this is extraordinary.

54:33.970 --> 54:37.415
Every house, I've been driving now, what, 15 miles,

54:37.450 --> 54:43.100
there isn't a pavement, there isn't a building,
there isn't anything that isn't smashed.

54:43.135 --> 54:47.500
It's such a vast scale of destruction.

54:48.770 --> 54:52.235
A year had passed since Katrina had blown through and...

54:52.270 --> 54:56.950
we sort of assumed that after 12 months the wealthiest
nation on earth would have fixed it.

54:56.985 --> 54:59.200
But we were wrong.

55:01.270 --> 55:07.120
How can the rest of America sleep at night knowing that this is here?

55:09.270 --> 55:10.965
It certainly gave us a problem:

55:11.000 --> 55:14.300
The original plan had been for us to sell our cars here

55:14.335 --> 55:16.235
and see who can get the most money.

55:16.270 --> 55:20.300
But in the midst of all this, that just seemed... wrong.

55:26.550 --> 55:31.885
We therefore had a con-flat and decided that we
should give our cars away.

55:31.920 --> 55:37.850
So we called a local mission who put us in
touch with some families who lost theirs in Ketrina.

55:37.885 --> 55:40.500
It got an alloy. It's all standard. It's not been messed with anyway.

55:40.535 --> 55:44.370
I met the guy who had it before. It's 150,000 miles and look:

55:44.405 --> 55:45.635
It's like new under there.

55:45.670 --> 55:48.050
- I like it.
- Done. It's yours. Take the truck.

55:48.085 --> 55:49.615
It's yours.

55:49.650 --> 55:52.020
Look after it. It's...it's been a good friend to me.

55:52.055 --> 55:53.985
Alright. I will sure do.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.850
Jeremy did his usual trick of telling it like it is.

55:57.885 --> 56:00.800
Rev counter, not good. Speedo, not good.

56:00.835 --> 56:03.815
Fuel gauge, not good.

56:03.850 --> 56:06.500
Dent on the roof, that was caused by a cow.

56:06.535 --> 56:08.615
As far as driving is concerned,

56:08.650 --> 56:12.970
the engine is brilliant. Gear box, tiptop.

56:13.005 --> 56:15.520
It's a good car. It's all yours.

56:18.800 --> 56:22.270
So, although it hadn't been the most relaxing holiday

56:22.305 --> 56:26.550
It had been a proper boys-own adventure.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.585
And what's more,

56:43.586 --> 56:49.026
we could go home knowing that we'd done a little bit to
help those less forturnate than ourselves.

56:50.770 --> 56:55.650
Well, Richard and I could but James sadly couldn't
even give his car away.

56:57.750 --> 57:02.135
- It's still here.
- A family came around this corner, not 10 minutes ago,

57:02.170 --> 57:05.920
- Oh, thank you. We lost everything in Hurricane Katrina.
- And rejected it.

57:05.955 --> 57:08.370
Do you want a lift to the airport, in my car?

57:08.405 --> 57:12.120
- No. I don't
- No. I will walk. Thank you.

57:15.450 --> 57:18.266
- Hammond, can I borrow the jump leads?
- No.

57:33.820 --> 57:38.920
I reckon if you look on Google Earth you'll be able to
see his car, cause it'll still be there.

57:38.955 --> 57:41.465
Plus, it won't be that hard to see it, either, it's big enough.

57:41.500 --> 57:45.400
No. Ok. So there is no doubt that James lost that challenge.

57:45.435 --> 57:46.915
And equally no doubt that I won.

57:46.950 --> 57:48.750
Hang on. How did you arrive at that?

57:48.785 --> 57:50.965
Well, my Camaro was the fastest,

57:51.000 --> 57:55.400
It had the best brakes, it didn't break down apart
from the wipers... much.

57:55.435 --> 57:56.915
So it was the best.

57:56.950 --> 58:01.570
It wasn't actually quite as easy to give away as
you made out in that film, was it?

58:01.605 --> 58:03.315
Well, I sort of...

58:03.350 --> 58:08.170
Why don't you tell the ladies and gentlemen what happened
after the cameras had been turned off.

58:08.205 --> 58:13.337
Well, a lady came and she said she was a lawyer
representing the Christian mission that we'd gone to.

58:13.372 --> 58:18.470
And she said she'd been promised by one of our researches
a 1991 Camaro, and it was an 89.

58:18.505 --> 58:22.500
and she said that was misrepresentation and she was going to sue me.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.015
It really did happen.

58:25.050 --> 58:27.875
Then she said that if I gave her $20,000 in cash,

58:27.910 --> 58:30.665
she might be able to make the case go away.

58:30.700 --> 58:33.265
And you won't believe what happened to us next.

58:33.300 --> 58:39.200
No. Which was that a very very large pickup turned up
full of heavily armed very burly men,

58:39.235 --> 58:41.115
told us to get off their street.

58:41.150 --> 58:45.600
Yes. So really, we do have 2 Top Gear Top Tips for you tonight.

58:45.635 --> 58:50.150
One: yes, you can buy rather than rent,

58:50.185 --> 58:52.370
and Two: don't go to America!

58:53.720 --> 59:00.309
Top Gear is back to its normal self next week.
So we'll see you then. Thanks for watching. Good night!
