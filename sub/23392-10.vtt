09:27.672 --> 09:28.963
I think we're
all out of wine, too.

09:28.963 --> 09:30.963
You know, I can help
on one of those fronts.

09:30.963 --> 09:32.630
Lit. Okay.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.713
And we have some
sparkling wine.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.088
Excuse me, sir.
Oh.

09:42.088 --> 09:43.129
That's your hammock?

09:43.129 --> 09:45.296
Uh, yeah.
Is everything okay?

09:45.296 --> 09:47.046
You can't hang a hammock
in the middle of the park.

09:47.046 --> 09:49.213
Oh, okay, I can take it down.
You want me to take it down?

09:49.213 --> 09:51.171
No, you know what? Whatever.

09:51.171 --> 09:52.213
It's cool.

09:53.338 --> 09:54.338
Okay.

09:55.254 --> 09:56.672
Hey, what are you doing?

09:56.672 --> 09:57.838
Why do you keep
coming over here?

09:57.838 --> 09:59.630
You're being, like,
um, so standoff-ish.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.088
I just want to be with you.

10:01.088 --> 10:02.630
Try something new.
Hang out with these...

10:02.630 --> 10:04.380
these peeps.
They're chill peeps.
Let them be chill.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.380
I don't-- I'm not--
I just wanna--
I want you to chill with us.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.546
I don't want to,
so have fun.

10:11.713 --> 10:13.588
Dahlia:
Now put your hand
over my boob.

10:13.588 --> 10:15.546
Oh, yeah, that's hot.

10:15.546 --> 10:18.296
Mmm, no, let's keep this on,
'cause I don't know how to swim.

Oh my God, the eclipse
is on the floor!

10:21.922 --> 10:23.213
Zach:
2:44.

10:23.213 --> 10:26.088

three minutes.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.630

10:33.713 --> 10:35.963
Neil Delin Tigress,
whatever the fuck his name is,

10:35.963 --> 10:38.880
said that I can
use a colander.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.505
Yeah, but you're not
supposed to look up.

10:40.505 --> 10:42.588
Then what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

10:44.088 --> 10:45.755
I think I'm going blind.

It's happening.

How do I know

Here we go!

10:58.755 --> 10:59.963
Just stand there, and...

10:59.963 --> 11:01.421
just shut the fuck up

11:02.546 --> 11:04.088
I think it's happening.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.713
Ow, but it--

11:05.713 --> 11:07.755
Ow. Ow. It hurts though.
Okay, look at me.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.672
Okay. So, um...

11:14.672 --> 11:18.004
I know that whenever
we've talked about marriage,

11:18.004 --> 11:19.588
that I've been kinda weird.

11:19.588 --> 11:21.129
The Guy:
Oh, whoa.

11:21.129 --> 11:23.088
Alina: I think it's
a bit of misogyny
and gender roles

11:23.088 --> 11:25.254
and stereotypes and...
Jed: Yo! Turn off the music!

11:25.254 --> 11:27.421
And my parents
are fucking weird, and...

11:27.421 --> 11:29.797
like, everyone
we know, like, fucks it up.

11:29.797 --> 11:33.129
And I was just thinking
about fucking it up,

11:33.129 --> 11:36.338
and that if I was gonna
fuck up the rest of my life,

11:36.338 --> 11:39.088
that I-I would want
you to be there.

11:39.088 --> 11:40.546
And...

11:40.546 --> 11:42.755
I just... I love you!

11:42.755 --> 11:43.797
I love you so much.

11:43.797 --> 11:45.546
I love you so much

11:54.797 --> 11:56.004
Of course.

11:56.004 --> 11:57.046

Oh my God, okay.
This is for you.

12:09.338 --> 12:10.713
Zach:
There's two here.

12:10.713 --> 12:13.463
Alina:
Of fucking course
there's two!

12:13.463 --> 12:15.880
You have quite the eye
for photography, young lady.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.630
If you fuck me now,
maybe I can help you

12:17.630 --> 12:19.171
with your graduate
school applications later.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.922
That's crazy, Roger.

12:21.922 --> 12:23.505

Eclipse!

She put a ring on it!

12:38.880 --> 12:41.046
Whoo!

12:44.755 --> 12:47.046
Wow.

12:47.046 --> 12:50.755
Honestly, that was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

12:54.713 --> 12:56.380
Um, babe, I don't
mean to rush,

12:56.380 --> 12:58.338
but the bakery
closes at six o'clock.

12:58.338 --> 13:00.213
Oh, shit!
We've gotta go!

13:00.213 --> 13:02.213
All right.
Yeah, so can we
paddle for once?

13:02.213 --> 13:03.546
Now I will help you, yes.

13:03.546 --> 13:06.546
Okay, do you have
dark spots in your vision?

13:06.546 --> 13:08.546
I'm definitely seeing
dark spots.

13:08.546 --> 13:10.046
I'm definitely-- oh!

13:11.713 --> 13:13.213
Oh my God!

13:14.338 --> 13:17.046
What the fuck?
Why are we on a cake?

13:18.004 --> 13:19.338
What the fuck?

13:19.338 --> 13:20.922
Alina: Do you love me?

13:20.922 --> 13:22.755
Zach: How did we get there?

13:24.004 --> 13:27.505
That is... hella pretty.
I'm not gonna lie.

13:27.505 --> 13:28.797
We're on that cake.

That means they were
creeping on us all afternoon.

13:31.963 --> 13:33.838

There was somebody
taking pictures of us.

13:33.838 --> 13:36.088
Zach: I can't take it off?
Alina: No, you can't
take it off.

13:36.088 --> 13:38.505
Jed:
That's exactly how
Princess Diana died!

13:38.505 --> 13:40.046
I just find that
a little bit creepy.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.588
Call it romantic--
It's not romantic.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.421
All right,
what if your boyfriend's
trying to surprise you.

13:44.421 --> 13:49.546
You're with your side dude,
he has pictures of you
with your side dude.

Steve RV.

15:24.713 --> 15:27.004
He bungles things,

15:27.004 --> 15:29.588
and he sometimes
puts his foot in his mouth,

15:29.588 --> 15:33.171
but overall, he's
a very charming vehicle,

15:33.171 --> 15:36.254

15:46.713 --> 15:48.755
This shag is fucking awesome.

15:48.755 --> 15:51.380
It's a little moist right now.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.797
I don't know why.

15:52.797 --> 15:55.338
And you got
a whole kitchen?

15:55.338 --> 15:56.463
The whole shebang.

15:56.463 --> 15:57.672
Survey says...

15:59.004 --> 16:00.380
This is cool.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.880
Then, I went up
through Nashville,

16:02.880 --> 16:05.213
and that was quite fun.

16:05.213 --> 16:07.672
And then I just hauled ass
back to Brooklyn.

16:07.672 --> 16:09.797
Mainly because I didn't
have any money left.

16:09.797 --> 16:12.880

are fucking scary.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.421

16:26.588 --> 16:28.129

16:39.672 --> 16:42.129
Ben, I'm really sorry
I ghosted on you.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.755
Yeah, what was that about?

16:47.129 --> 16:49.129
I was just in a really
weird spot.

16:49.129 --> 16:52.088
For a bit there,
I was drinking a lot,

16:52.088 --> 16:53.296
and other stuff,

16:53.296 --> 16:55.797
and I wanted to...

16:55.797 --> 16:57.630
clean up my life
and just start again,

16:57.630 --> 17:00.421
and I didn't know how to--

17:00.421 --> 17:04.755
I'm not very good with this
fucking... conversation shit,

17:04.755 --> 17:07.338
and I avoided it.

17:07.338 --> 17:08.463
Yeah.

17:11.672 --> 17:13.838
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.129

17:17.129 --> 17:20.338

sober is good for me.

17:24.838 --> 17:26.797

17:28.296 --> 17:30.296
Yes.

17:33.171 --> 17:35.421
Anyway.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.672
So I'm thinking now,
I need to go home for a bit.

17:39.963 --> 17:41.505

17:41.505 --> 17:43.838
