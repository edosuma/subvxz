<i>Control, this is Air One.
I'm at the trailer park 402.</i>

00:13.878 --> 00:17.708
<i>There's a large gas main construction
fire. The scene is totally involved.</i>

00:47.542 --> 00:50.708
Warrick, why don't you and I take
the perimeter and work our way in.

00:50.709 --> 00:51.731
All right.

00:51.749 --> 00:54.359
- Greg, you're with us.
- I'll start the sketch.

00:58.978 --> 00:59.992
How you doing, Nick ?

00:59.993 --> 01:01.708
Above ground, Wilcox.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.275
Would you like inside or out ?

01:05.277 --> 01:06.494
I'll take in.

01:06.495 --> 01:08.425
We have two vics.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.682
We think the girl is Selena March.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.563
She owns the trailer.

01:15.093 --> 01:16.491
What about the male ?

01:16.491 --> 01:17.749
Nothing yet.

01:18.571 --> 01:20.604
This is a piece of
the roof right here--

01:20.605 --> 01:22.803
fiberglass and particle board.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.104
These things weren't built to last.

01:26.289 --> 01:28.089
They were built to burn.

01:28.184 --> 01:29.625
This place is totaled.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.052
The bed's collapsed.

01:31.053 --> 01:32.527
My money's on meth lab.

01:32.528 --> 01:33.920
You know, Metcalf,

01:33.921 --> 01:36.032
just because somebody
lives in a trailer park,

01:36.033 --> 01:37.908
doesn't mean they're a meth cook.

01:37.909 --> 01:40.486
You guys are a real pain
in the ass, you know that ?

01:40.487 --> 01:42.199
Get used to it, pal.

02:16.439 --> 02:18.330
You know, I'm just having
a little trouble understanding this

02:18.349 --> 02:20.330
'cause you all live
so close together.

02:20.331 --> 02:22.631
You mean none of you saw the explosion ?

02:22.632 --> 02:23.782
Uh, I heard it.

02:23.783 --> 02:24.862
Well, good.

02:24.863 --> 02:26.390
When I came out...

02:26.391 --> 02:28.463
about five minutes later,

02:28.464 --> 02:29.943
the whole place was burnin' up.

02:29.944 --> 02:31.399
Where do you live ?

02:31.577 --> 02:33.051
Right over there.

02:33.337 --> 02:34.312
Uh-huh.

02:34.313 --> 02:35.958
All right, let me
get this straight--

02:36.510 --> 02:38.714
you heard a blast like that
coming from your neighbor's

02:38.715 --> 02:42.000
and it took you five minutes to poke
your head out and see what was going on ?

02:42.001 --> 02:43.673
I was watching TV.

02:43.674 --> 02:45.835
I'm sure he was drinking.

02:46.454 --> 02:48.863
No, hang around, hang
around. Hey, hang around.

02:49.042 --> 02:51.133
Did you find a man in Selena's trailer ?

02:51.134 --> 02:52.672
Now why would you ask that ?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.276
Was Selena a hooker ?

02:54.277 --> 02:56.114
I'm sure I don't know.

02:56.211 --> 02:58.248
But one thing I do know...

02:58.839 --> 03:00.934
that's not Selena's car.

03:11.522 --> 03:12.431
Yeah ?

03:12.432 --> 03:16.054
Catherine, we have a
4-19 off Industrial.

03:16.276 --> 03:18.068
Do you mind handling it ?

03:18.370 --> 03:22.145
So you get the team back together
only to break us apart again.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.707
What kind of a perverse game
are you playing here, Gil ?

03:24.708 --> 03:25.987
I'm not a pervert.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.750
Yeah, I'll cover it.
I'm taking Warrick.

03:39.142 --> 03:40.258
Oh, hey, guys.

03:40.259 --> 03:41.819
Good to see you.

03:42.209 --> 03:45.736
Hey, would you tell Nick I hope there's no
hard feelings about that whole, you know,

03:45.737 --> 03:47.456
abduction thing.

03:47.457 --> 03:49.490
He hasn't returned my calls.

03:49.491 --> 03:50.927
He's been busy.

03:53.633 --> 03:56.038
Squad car found her about
a half hour ago-- no ID,

03:56.039 --> 03:58.324
but there's a lot of
homeless in this area.

04:00.410 --> 04:02.599
Looks like somebody took
something to her head.

04:02.630 --> 04:05.283
Didn't find a weapon, but
my guys are still looking.

04:06.031 --> 04:09.854
A shopping bag for a shirt,
rubber boots and a G-string.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.590
Homeless stripper ?

04:12.751 --> 04:15.094
Well, this is G-String Row, isn't it ?

04:17.120 --> 04:19.309
Why is there a ring on your ring finger ?

04:20.867 --> 04:22.235
Because I'm married.

04:23.674 --> 04:24.689
What ?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.422
Congratulations.

04:26.842 --> 04:28.305
How much did you pay her ?

04:28.839 --> 04:30.414
No, seriously...

04:30.415 --> 04:33.125
good luck with that, man. I didn't
even know you had a girlfriend.

04:33.126 --> 04:36.238
Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been
dating a couple months, Tina.

04:36.239 --> 04:37.798
How long have you been married ?

04:38.382 --> 04:39.990
Since yesterday.

04:40.058 --> 04:44.900
Did this, uh, drive-through wedding
at Circus Circus Way, you know.

04:44.901 --> 04:46.932
Fun, fun time.

04:46.933 --> 04:50.020
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Busy night.

04:51.072 --> 04:53.481
We need a TOD, David.

04:54.263 --> 04:57.137
Rigor's barely set,
so not long.

04:57.138 --> 04:58.541
Under four hours.

04:58.542 --> 05:00.872
About as long as Warrick's been married.

05:00.873 --> 05:02.165
You're married ?

05:02.716 --> 05:04.192
Congratulations.

05:04.193 --> 05:05.088
Thanks.

05:05.789 --> 05:07.242
Do you think she was dumped ?

05:09.075 --> 05:11.979
Lividity is consistent with
the position of the body.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.806
So it's highly unlikely.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.335
All right. I'll check
out the strip clubs.

05:16.336 --> 05:17.695
I'll go with you.

05:21.539 --> 05:22.650
Well...

05:22.916 --> 05:25.245
there doesn't seem to be any
drug-manufacturing supplies,

05:25.246 --> 05:30.560
but plenty of ignition sources : a hot
plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles.

05:30.881 --> 05:33.014
One leaky pipe's all it takes.

05:35.106 --> 05:37.509
Which I haven't found yet.

05:37.510 --> 05:40.608
Yeah, but even if you had, that would
only explain the explosion in here,

05:40.609 --> 05:43.131
not the ruptured gas main outside.

05:43.132 --> 05:45.140
Think I can help you with that.

05:45.254 --> 05:47.666
I found this gas meter over by the main.

05:47.677 --> 05:49.013
Trailer blows,

05:49.014 --> 05:51.146
this thing becomes a missile.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.733
One explosion leads to another.

05:57.734 --> 05:59.694
Yeah, but where did it all start ?

06:00.591 --> 06:03.044
Brass ran the plates on
that Acura near the trailer.

06:03.045 --> 06:05.466
It's registered to a Robert Durgee.

06:05.467 --> 06:06.878
You get his photo from the DMV ?

06:06.879 --> 06:07.948
Confirmed as the vic--

06:07.949 --> 06:09.981
Henderson address, mortgage broker.

06:09.982 --> 06:11.563
Wife's name was on the insurance card.

06:11.564 --> 06:12.403
She coming in ?

06:12.404 --> 06:13.345
She wasn't home.

06:13.346 --> 06:14.959
Brass is tracking her down.

06:15.697 --> 06:17.443
Excuse me, Mr. Grissom...

06:17.792 --> 06:21.640
An officer brought this in off
a call from Flora Nevada Nursery.

06:21.641 --> 06:25.359
They thought it might have something
to do with the Walter Gordon case.

06:36.127 --> 06:38.536
Female's lungs were filled with soot.

06:38.537 --> 06:40.302
COD is smoke inhalation.

06:40.303 --> 06:43.395
Okay, that means the natural
gas didn't suffocate her.

06:43.396 --> 06:46.585
Explosion probably knocked her out
before the fire even started.

06:46.586 --> 06:49.781
Yeah, male didn't even last that long.

06:49.971 --> 06:54.116
His lungs were clean, but he suffered
fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen.

06:54.197 --> 06:57.866
The pieces of debris that were
on this guy's body were not heavy.

06:58.482 --> 07:00.882
But the bed he was lying in collapsed.

07:00.882 --> 07:02.940
Explosion could've done that.

07:07.374 --> 07:09.838
Let's photo-enhance these bruises.

07:38.810 --> 07:43.258
Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely
bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.

07:51.374 --> 07:53.352
That looks like a tire mark.

07:59.165 --> 08:02.408
Maybe our gas explosion
just turned into a hit-and-run.

08:29.612 --> 08:33.062
Well, Robert said that he
was going to be working late.

08:33.203 --> 08:36.777
So I went to midnight bingo.

08:37.369 --> 08:38.664
Alone ?

08:39.647 --> 08:41.029
Excuse me ?

08:41.899 --> 08:43.025
Alone ?

08:43.919 --> 08:45.144
I was...

08:45.916 --> 08:47.485
with a friend.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.075
What was your friend's name ?

08:50.159 --> 08:51.406
Why ?

08:51.936 --> 08:53.110
Why not ?

08:57.629 --> 08:59.667
He's married.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.432
Looks like the only person
in this thing who isn't married

09:02.460 --> 09:04.833
is the dead girl in
the trailer with your husband.

09:06.203 --> 09:08.397
You didn't know he was having an affair ?

09:08.479 --> 09:10.457
No, I had no idea.

09:10.501 --> 09:12.764
You have a '96 blue Ford Ranger.

09:12.765 --> 09:14.688
We're going to need
to take a look at it.

09:14.689 --> 09:18.730
But my truck is in New Mexico. My brother
borrowed it this morning, he, uh...

09:18.731 --> 09:19.752
A wild guess:

09:19.753 --> 09:22.096
you have no idea how to reach him.

09:22.273 --> 09:24.458
Not until he gets back.

09:25.237 --> 09:27.208
Why do you need to see my truck ?

09:27.209 --> 09:28.731
Let me tell you a story.

09:28.732 --> 09:31.542
Once upon a time, you follow
your husband to a trailer park.

09:31.543 --> 09:33.935
You see him slumming with
his little trailer bunny.

09:33.936 --> 09:35.597
You waited for him to come out...

09:45.337 --> 09:48.040
When she pulls the body back in,
before she can call for help,

09:48.041 --> 09:50.761
you torch the place. Kaboom.

09:52.775 --> 09:53.865
The end.

09:54.352 --> 09:57.267
That is the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

09:58.653 --> 10:00.826
Wouldn't even make my top ten.

10:02.590 --> 10:07.039
So that's when the bereaved
Mrs. Durgee lawyered up.

10:07.484 --> 10:10.742
Broadcast's out on her truck,
and the warrant's ready to go.

10:11.343 --> 10:13.545
Put him in the tank
and see if he wises up.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.962
Sure as hell can't get any dumber.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.989
Detective Curtis.

10:18.323 --> 10:19.364
Grissom.

10:19.365 --> 10:22.888
I thought you were supposed to be
arresting people in Boulder City.

10:23.627 --> 10:25.719
Well, a spot opened up here and...

10:25.720 --> 10:27.515
I transferred in today.

10:27.516 --> 10:28.946
S urprise.

10:32.878 --> 10:36.024
Well, your mother would be proud.

10:36.098 --> 10:38.149
My mother made Captain.

10:38.301 --> 10:39.707
You know,

10:39.837 --> 10:42.258
I'd just qualified for
my shield when the sheriff

10:42.259 --> 10:45.539
pulled my papers and
"volunteered" me to CSI.

10:45.756 --> 10:49.012
I think my mom hated that
more than I did.

10:49.342 --> 10:51.344
You won't miss the lab, will you ?

10:52.218 --> 10:54.026
There' s some things I'll miss.

10:55.190 --> 10:56.657
I'll see you around.

11:51.829 --> 11:55.066
So, Vartann and I struck
out on G-String Row.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.813
You poor guys.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.403
Yeah, right.

11:58.457 --> 12:01.535
You know what I mean. No one
recognized the victim's picture.

12:04.152 --> 12:05.442
Listen, Cath,

12:05.443 --> 12:07.817
about this whole marriage thing...

12:07.818 --> 12:09.626
Yeah, that.

12:09.892 --> 12:12.137
Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop.

12:13.487 --> 12:14.795
Tina, right ?

12:14.923 --> 12:16.025
Yeah.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.339
She must be a very special woman.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.885
I look forward to meeting her.

12:19.886 --> 12:20.323
Yes, she...

12:20.324 --> 12:24.494
The vic's blood-alcohol
level was .16 and

12:24.495 --> 12:27.593
COD was blunt-force trauma.

12:36.207 --> 12:39.305
- Smashed and then smashed, huh ?
- Mm-hmm.

12:40.347 --> 12:42.958
Any luck on the, uh...

12:43.061 --> 12:44.082
victim's prints ?

12:44.083 --> 12:46.353
No work card, no record.

12:46.524 --> 12:51.034
But the rubber boots were
standard-issue Streets and Sanitation.

12:53.897 --> 12:54.850
"E.V." ?

12:54.851 --> 12:57.729
Yeah, there's three S&S
workers with those initials.

12:58.288 --> 13:03.072
And it looks like an Eddie
Vonner was on duty last night.

13:03.272 --> 13:04.927
Why would you want to see my boots ?

13:04.928 --> 13:06.112
You tell us.

13:06.113 --> 13:08.840
Look, I know it's against
the regs to pick up

13:08.841 --> 13:11.902
anything other than trash,
but, I mean, come on.

13:12.348 --> 13:15.721
She was barefoot ; she was
stepping on glass and crap,

13:15.722 --> 13:19.574
so, yeah, I gave her my boots.
And she practically begged, so,

13:20.470 --> 13:21.589
I gave her a lift.

13:21.590 --> 13:22.842
So, you're just a good Samaritan.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.118
Oh, come on, it was pretty
obvious she didn't belong there.

13:25.119 --> 13:25.734
Where ?

13:25.735 --> 13:28.754
Jefferson and K ? You ever see the citizens
that hang out in that neighborhood ?

13:28.755 --> 13:30.579
When I see them, they're usually dead.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.144
Well, there you go.

13:32.919 --> 13:35.798
I mean, come on, she...
I could tell, despite the...

13:35.889 --> 13:37.708
well, the get-up, she was hot.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.011
And, I mean, I'm not talking like
garbage truck hot. I mean, she was like...

13:41.998 --> 13:43.056
like limo hot.

13:43.057 --> 13:45.351
Listen, did she tell you her name, or,

13:45.352 --> 13:47.176
uh, how she ended up there, anything ?

13:47.177 --> 13:49.624
She looked kind of embarrassed,
so I didn't push it.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.827
So, I just... I dropped
her off down at, uh,

13:51.828 --> 13:54.865
Western and Industrial.
Never left my route.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.807
Why, did she, uh... ?

13:56.910 --> 13:58.487
She say anything about me ?

13:58.787 --> 14:00.125
She died

14:00.126 --> 14:02.481
a few blocks from where
you dropped her off.

14:14.303 --> 14:17.102
If the wife torched the trailer
and caused the explosion,

14:17.103 --> 14:21.484
you would expect to see small debris
embedded all over the inside of these walls.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.000
There's nothing here.

14:31.182 --> 14:32.880
Hey, hey... Sara.

14:33.641 --> 14:35.071
Check this out.

14:35.638 --> 14:38.541
This is a piece of the exterior wall

14:39.044 --> 14:40.574
facing the road.

14:41.996 --> 14:44.049
- With a tire mark on it ?
- Yeah.

14:44.564 --> 14:48.380
There is blue paint on this gas main.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.059
Didn't mean anything at the time.

14:52.589 --> 14:54.754
Amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right ?

14:54.755 --> 14:55.289
Uh-huh.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.709
What if

14:57.301 --> 14:59.729
Amber follows her husband to trailer,

14:59.856 --> 15:01.817
sees him go inside,

15:01.818 --> 15:03.460
totally freaks out.

15:03.461 --> 15:05.146
Why wait for him to come out ?

15:12.252 --> 15:13.351
Yeah.

15:13.352 --> 15:16.741
Yeah, just come straight through.
Run him over in bed with another chick.

15:16.761 --> 15:19.255
Trailer collapses, fire breaks out,

15:19.256 --> 15:22.706
sweeps through, and destroys
practically all evidence of a collision.

15:23.316 --> 15:27.301
It's too bad we don't have her truck.
We could match this to her tires.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.069
Well, '96 Ford Ranger, stock paint.

15:30.070 --> 15:32.705
Maybe I can match the transfer...

15:33.114 --> 15:34.703
...to this.

15:36.418 --> 15:37.561
I'm starving.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.147
There's a uni going out for sandwiches.
Would you like me to get you something ?

15:41.301 --> 15:43.449
No, no, you go ahead.
I'm gonna...

15:43.577 --> 15:45.080
I'm gonna work on this.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.030
According to the garbageman,
she ran up from this direction.

16:40.031 --> 16:40.962
Yeah ?

16:40.963 --> 16:42.771
Must be where she got the bag.

16:52.156 --> 16:53.968
Victim wasn't carrying a cell phone.

16:53.969 --> 16:57.821
She's in the wrong part of town in
her underwear, scared out of her head.

16:58.102 --> 17:01.358
She's gonna call her
man, her family, someone.

17:02.028 --> 17:05.368
And she didn't have a
quarter, so she called 911.

17:05.428 --> 17:07.028
I'll print the phones.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.964
I'll dump the call records.

17:15.353 --> 17:17.574
Let's get the traffic cameras, too.

17:20.887 --> 17:21.874
The, uh,

17:21.875 --> 17:26.759
tread mark on your trailer wall is
consistent with Michelin 195/70/R14s.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.809
What about the blue paint scrapings
we found on the gas main ?

17:29.810 --> 17:32.348
You got a real thing for
blue paint. You know that ?

17:32.429 --> 17:35.220
But, uh, this isn't from
a Ford Ranger, or any Ford

17:35.221 --> 17:37.486
for that matter.
It's a GMC paint.

17:37.487 --> 17:41.375
Amber Durgee was cheating on her husband,
maybe even wanted him dead, but...

17:41.741 --> 17:43.595
her truck didn't have
anything to do with it.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.824
Right tires,

17:44.825 --> 17:46.633
- wrong vehicle.
- Mm.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.130
Found something ?

18:32.131 --> 18:33.914
Part of a headlamp, maybe.

18:33.915 --> 18:35.472
Well, I found some blue

18:35.473 --> 18:38.083
paint transfer on
that chain-link fence.

18:38.510 --> 18:39.994
As far as tracks go,

18:39.995 --> 18:41.970
this place is a parking lot, man.
They're everywhere.

18:41.971 --> 18:44.594
Except between the gas
main and the trailer.

18:44.970 --> 18:48.116
So, the trailer wasn't rammed ?

18:49.346 --> 18:53.912
I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicular
equivalent of a through-and-through.

18:55.507 --> 18:56.918
Car comes down the road.

18:56.919 --> 18:59.469
Gas main acts as a ramp.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.249
Flying car.

19:13.381 --> 19:15.785
That's what we're gonna go with ?

19:16.244 --> 19:17.540
Okay.

19:19.819 --> 19:24.416
The partial OEM number on the headlamp
piece belongs to a '97 Pontiac Sunfire.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.159
Boy, that was quick.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.439
Well, GMC paint--
tire model wasn't that tough.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.034
I'll put out another broadcast.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.051
All right.

19:37.057 --> 19:40.970
Your broadcast was for a blue Pontiac.
Patrol figured this was worth a look.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.299
How bad does a smell have to get

19:43.300 --> 19:45.663
before Parking Control calls Homicide ?

19:45.664 --> 19:47.637
No way this car was at the trailer park.

19:47.638 --> 19:49.382
Think we've got a new case.

19:49.674 --> 19:52.202
First citation was issued five days ago.

19:52.203 --> 19:53.807
Car's probably been here at least six.

19:53.808 --> 19:55.980
Six days in the summer heat.

20:00.037 --> 20:02.490
And a trunk becomes a Crockpot.

20:03.624 --> 20:05.781
Looks like a male and a female.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.442
That could be an entry
wound in her skull.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.396
Well, if she was shot in there,

20:13.397 --> 20:17.571
there might be bullets and casing. I say we
process the car in place. Let's get rolling.

20:17.572 --> 20:20.685
Area is uncontrolled. Evidence
can be contaminated or lost.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.571
We need to get this back to the lab.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.443
Car condom.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.278
<i>Hi, CSI guy.</i>

20:56.275 --> 20:58.307
<i>You're wondering why you're here ?</i>

20:59.178 --> 21:02.414
<i>- Because you followed the evidence.
- Archie ? Archie ?</i>

21:02.415 --> 21:03.898
Do you have anything
on pay phone dump ?

21:03.899 --> 21:05.830
Oh. Yeah.

21:07.442 --> 21:11.813
The 911 call about five minutes before
your garbageman picked up the vic.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.551
Then I matched timecodes with
the video from the traffic cam.

21:16.032 --> 21:17.776
Synched up the audio.

21:18.536 --> 21:20.283
911. What is your emergency ?

21:20.284 --> 21:21.553
Whoa !

21:21.843 --> 21:23.307
That's our girl.

21:23.465 --> 21:25.274
No. I don't know where I am,

21:25.275 --> 21:26.505
okay ?!

21:27.902 --> 21:29.685
Someone's getting territorial.

21:29.686 --> 21:31.298
I'll put Vartann on it.

21:34.906 --> 21:38.205
Vic loses her shoes.
Explains the boots.

21:38.206 --> 21:39.872
Let see where she came from.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.979
Rewind it a little bit, would you ?

21:45.145 --> 21:47.083
Oh. Stop. Hold it.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.503
That looks like an airport shuttle.

21:54.907 --> 21:56.480
There's a logo on this side.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.278
Y eah.

21:57.279 --> 21:58.906
I can enhance that.

22:01.549 --> 22:02.722
That's a limo ?

22:02.792 --> 22:04.223
This is Vegas.

22:04.451 --> 22:06.276
It's a strip bar on wheels.

22:12.029 --> 22:13.522
I don't even pay
attention to the talent.

22:13.523 --> 22:15.187
I just drive down
Industrial Boulevard,

22:15.188 --> 22:17.178
from strip club to
strip club, picking 'em up.

22:17.769 --> 22:18.958
It's like bus stops.

22:18.968 --> 22:20.384
Before you know it,
we're full,

22:20.449 --> 22:21.651
the bus is on fire...

22:28.964 --> 22:29.906
We call it the...

22:29.934 --> 22:31.530
"Champagne Ride".

22:31.811 --> 22:32.635
It's nice.

22:32.696 --> 22:34.400
So what do the girls
get paid for this ?

22:34.401 --> 22:35.973
The girls, they make uh...

22:36.306 --> 22:36.787
at...

22:37.447 --> 22:39.614
least twice as much
as they do in the clubs.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.760
Depending on what else they ride.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.390
It's a pretty sweet
deal for the guys.

23:01.493 --> 23:02.937
Hot chicks getting trashed

23:02.938 --> 23:04.374
with no security and...

23:04.654 --> 23:05.819
nowhere to go.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.703
And what happens when

23:07.747 --> 23:09.429
the girls want to get off ?

23:09.718 --> 23:11.797
Usually, it's the guys
that are getting off.

23:13.224 --> 23:15.792
I found something in there
besides body fluids.

23:15.793 --> 23:17.242
Belongs to the victim,

23:17.369 --> 23:18.280
Brooke Harris.

23:18.638 --> 23:20.655
You dropped that girl off
in a war zone, man.

23:20.705 --> 23:23.716
When the guy paying the tab says
he wants to stop, I just stop.

23:28.855 --> 23:29.506
Stop it !

23:29.774 --> 23:31.097
Back off, jerk !

23:31.182 --> 23:32.377
Stop the bus !

23:32.434 --> 23:33.632
Get her off the bus !

23:33.899 --> 23:34.889
No, I don't want...

23:35.303 --> 23:37.246
Look, strippers are
tough chicks, okay ?

23:37.480 --> 23:40.143
I figured she'd find a way home,
one way or another.

23:45.881 --> 23:48.090
Brooke Harris was
getting calls from a gym ?

23:48.098 --> 23:50.025
Well, the "Giselle" number
went straight to voice mail.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.454
The voice mail said
to contact her here.

23:52.793 --> 23:54.624
And what's the word
on the husband ?

23:55.838 --> 23:57.028
- The husband.
- Yeah... no,

23:57.035 --> 23:59.516
according to his office, he's
away in Laughlin on business.

23:59.517 --> 24:01.248
We're still trying
to get in touch...

24:02.425 --> 24:04.983
Swing those legs up and around.

24:05.383 --> 24:06.959
Yeah, like a waterfall...

24:06.987 --> 24:08.632
you got it. That's it !

24:12.623 --> 24:14.659
So I called Brooke a few times.

24:14.712 --> 24:16.703
So what ? She was
one of my students.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.714
You actually teach this ?

24:18.891 --> 24:21.291
Strippers have
the best bodies in town.

24:21.383 --> 24:23.155
If you want the body,
this is how you get it.

24:23.227 --> 24:23.799
Trust me,

24:23.914 --> 24:26.952
I've been doing this since
before I had my driver's license.

24:27.047 --> 24:28.788
Well, workout is one thing.

24:28.841 --> 24:31.932
What is a housewife
from Centennial Park

24:31.935 --> 24:34.298
doing on a stripper bus with pros ?

24:34.587 --> 24:35.923
She wanted it.

24:36.534 --> 24:37.595
- Come on...
- No, really.

24:37.596 --> 24:39.020
She loved the attention.

24:39.380 --> 24:42.024
Loved the fantasy.
She wanted to try it for real.

24:42.027 --> 24:44.757
See how she stacked up
against some real talent.

24:44.767 --> 24:46.545
And you let her ?

24:46.643 --> 24:48.757
Do I look like her mother ?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.881
You were teaching her a lesson.

24:51.293 --> 24:52.863
If I'd wanted to do that,

24:53.150 --> 24:55.208
I would've sent her to Stripperama,

24:55.273 --> 24:56.367
fed her to the wolves.

24:56.368 --> 24:58.978
And drunk CEOs aren't wolves ?

24:59.509 --> 25:01.898
They're worse.
You know that.

25:01.943 --> 25:03.637
That's why you kept calling her.

25:03.704 --> 25:06.174
So you could hear
all about it, right ?

25:06.312 --> 25:08.371
I was just calling
to see how things went.

25:08.441 --> 25:09.515
Oh, really ?

25:09.663 --> 25:11.842
It's starting to sound
like I need a lawyer.

25:14.801 --> 25:19.488
So I pulled all the ROs from
all the '97 blue Sunfires in Nevada,

25:19.569 --> 25:22.246
one name and address
just jumped out...

25:23.555 --> 25:24.886
Randy Swansiger.

25:25.226 --> 25:26.705
Las Vegas Police !

25:27.661 --> 25:28.765
Come on out, Randy.

25:31.284 --> 25:33.195
Walk out slowly, Randy.

25:34.364 --> 25:35.625
Michelin tires.

25:36.788 --> 25:37.634
Blue car.

25:38.095 --> 25:39.209
Broken headlamp.

25:39.828 --> 25:41.208
Hey, how's it goin' ?

25:41.212 --> 25:43.353
I'm Detective Jim Brass.
Remember me ?

25:44.043 --> 25:46.726
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Whoa, whoa...

25:46.981 --> 25:48.469
What are you guys doing ?

25:48.507 --> 25:51.242
You got a couple of DWIs
on your record.

25:51.291 --> 25:53.332
What have you got to say
for yourself, Randy ?

25:54.823 --> 25:56.132
I was coming home...

25:57.052 --> 25:58.326
been working late...

26:01.535 --> 26:04.276
I guess I fell asleep
at the wheel...

26:10.816 --> 26:12.211
Next thing I know...

26:13.493 --> 26:15.030
crash-boom-bang !

26:18.106 --> 26:19.943
The car still worked, so...

26:43.646 --> 26:45.804
Drain plug's probably
under the carpet.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.331
I think I found it.

26:51.632 --> 26:52.572
Ahh...

26:54.125 --> 26:56.464
Technically,
that makes you a cannibal.

26:58.879 --> 27:00.285
Grissom would be proud.

27:02.308 --> 27:05.540
Grissom would've
tasted it on purpose.

27:09.229 --> 27:10.069
It's working.

27:56.612 --> 27:58.492
That makes 34 prints.

27:58.837 --> 28:00.587
Jacqui's going to love me.

28:02.790 --> 28:04.062
You got something ?

28:04.065 --> 28:05.339
I think so...

28:07.444 --> 28:08.639
Bullet fragment.

28:09.390 --> 28:10.686
Copper-jacketed.

28:10.994 --> 28:12.222
Rules out a .22.

28:12.514 --> 28:14.705
See, it was worth it.

28:16.121 --> 28:18.208
You better get ready for this
because this is going

28:18.209 --> 28:19.716
to blow you away.

28:20.601 --> 28:21.817
The rust-colored material

28:21.818 --> 28:23.356
found on the victim's head wound...

28:23.364 --> 28:24.237
was rust.

28:24.891 --> 28:26.404
Plain old ferric oxide,

28:26.528 --> 28:29.156
found on nearly every iron
object on the planet Earth.

28:29.599 --> 28:30.624
Case breaker ?

28:30.923 --> 28:31.407
No ?

28:32.232 --> 28:34.720
As they say,
"garbage in, garbage out."

28:35.792 --> 28:36.920
Um...

28:37.142 --> 28:40.695
the Champagne Ride
picks up strippers

28:40.861 --> 28:42.935
near the clubs,
but not actually

28:43.004 --> 28:44.165
at the clubs.

28:44.621 --> 28:46.018
Right. The owners

28:46.333 --> 28:48.411
don't like that bus coming
anywhere near the clubs

28:48.412 --> 28:49.900
because they don't make
any money off them.

28:49.915 --> 28:51.364
Well, look,

28:51.747 --> 28:53.516
Brooke Harris wasn't
planning to die that night.

28:53.517 --> 28:55.534
She had to have parked
her car somewhere.

28:55.644 --> 28:56.720
Well, there's a

28:57.346 --> 28:59.209
secured parking lot

28:59.315 --> 29:01.955
not too far from where
the garbageman dropped her off.

29:02.092 --> 29:04.802
So, if she parked
her car here...

29:06.149 --> 29:08.859
why did she go here ?

29:11.402 --> 29:13.472
- Hey, Catherine...
- Yes ?

29:14.897 --> 29:16.307
Can we talk ?

29:17.206 --> 29:18.091
About this ?

29:22.986 --> 29:23.539
Sure.

29:25.309 --> 29:27.106
You know, what happened to Nick...

29:28.019 --> 29:29.618
it just got me thinking.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.890
Life is so short, you know ?

29:35.840 --> 29:36.963
It's almost...

29:38.467 --> 29:41.059
it's almost shorter
than we want to ever believe.

29:42.753 --> 29:43.887
Live for the day.

29:44.164 --> 29:44.758
Exactly.

29:45.684 --> 29:46.417
So,

29:48.343 --> 29:49.684
I, uh...

29:49.974 --> 29:51.191
I've been heading

29:51.197 --> 29:53.471
to ask this young lady
I've been seeing, Tina,

29:53.472 --> 29:55.477
to marry me.

29:57.555 --> 29:59.389
You know that I'm happy for you.

29:59.477 --> 30:00.541
Yeah ?

30:02.179 --> 30:03.078
Yeah.

30:04.268 --> 30:07.367
But it also feels like
you're not so happy for me.

30:13.763 --> 30:14.990
Warrick...

30:22.826 --> 30:24.737
You know, the thing
that makes a fantasy great

30:24.739 --> 30:27.004
is the possibility
that it might come true.

30:28.668 --> 30:32.124
And when you lose
that possibility...

30:34.640 --> 30:36.724
it just kind of sucks.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.138
Okay, Mr. Greg,

30:43.139 --> 30:45.774
your most likely match
is a .44 round

30:45.776 --> 30:49.211
recovered from a drug-related
shoot-out in Mesquite

30:49.224 --> 30:50.375
five days ago.

30:50.476 --> 30:51.530
Case is still open.

30:52.091 --> 30:55.146
That's roughly two days after
the bodies ended up in the trunk.

30:55.515 --> 30:58.166
Maybe our vics were the
beginning of a little crime spree.

30:58.217 --> 30:58.751
Thanks.

30:59.063 --> 31:00.422
I ran the Grand Am's VIN.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.918
Last RO was a tow yard
over by Nellis.

31:03.314 --> 31:04.792
Vehicle's most likely
an impound,

31:04.800 --> 31:08.011
sold under the table to some
scammer who faked his tags.

31:08.012 --> 31:09.692
- You're not going to get
far in that direction.
- I know.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.031
What about prints ?

31:11.032 --> 31:13.294
13 different IDs.
Some off work cards,

31:13.302 --> 31:15.273
some off felonies
ranging from assault,

31:15.282 --> 31:17.564
B&E, cocaine trafficking.

31:17.768 --> 31:20.768
Well, even if I do manage
to track them all down,

31:20.999 --> 31:23.600
there's no guarantee any of these
were involved with the vics.

31:23.603 --> 31:25.043
Well, they didn't put
themselves in the trunk,

31:25.046 --> 31:26.643
and unless they were shot
right there at the curb,

31:26.644 --> 31:28.018
somebody drove the car there.

31:28.453 --> 31:29.280
You're the detective.

31:29.674 --> 31:30.479
Go detect.

31:30.766 --> 31:32.501
Fully developed
skeletal structure

31:32.508 --> 31:34.469
consistent with an adult male.

31:35.359 --> 31:38.501
The medial end of the
clavicle's almost fused.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.842
Suggests he's about
25 years old.

31:41.101 --> 31:44.882
Lack of prognathism
indicates he's Caucasian.

31:45.841 --> 31:48.440
The female, however,
is prognathic...

31:50.362 --> 31:52.409
and that suggests Negroid.

31:53.498 --> 31:56.916
Unfused epiphysial ends
make her a teenager.

31:57.530 --> 32:00.196
White male,
younger black female...

32:00.472 --> 32:01.789
racially motivated ?

32:02.006 --> 32:03.580
Could be a Son of Sam thing.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.210
Summertime, couple on a date,

32:06.423 --> 32:07.766
making out in the car.

32:08.234 --> 32:09.736
Berkowitz used a .44.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.849
Gunshot wounds are
most likely COD for both.

32:13.138 --> 32:15.546
Female shows an entry wound
at the rear of the skull.

32:15.635 --> 32:17.883
Exit wound took off
most of her face.

32:18.593 --> 32:22.071
Male has no exit wound,
but the entry wound...

32:22.528 --> 32:23.760
is pretty obvious.

32:25.572 --> 32:27.420
Bullet never left the skull.

32:27.454 --> 32:29.349
That would explain
the bullet fragments.

32:29.611 --> 32:31.900
What we need are IDs.

32:32.198 --> 32:35.006
No missing persons
filed for Caucasian males

32:35.006 --> 32:37.371
between 20 and 30
in the last two weeks,

32:37.371 --> 32:39.529
but there are possibles
for the girl.

32:41.248 --> 32:43.364
Two cases still open.

32:44.507 --> 32:45.877
13 seems a little young.

32:45.877 --> 32:47.578
Could be a kidnapping.

32:50.190 --> 32:51.393
The other one's 16.

32:52.485 --> 32:55.182
This is one time it would
be better to stay missing.

33:00.611 --> 33:04.525
I also brought her
toothbrush and her hairbrush.

33:05.430 --> 33:08.110
This one's from her doctor.

33:08.767 --> 33:10.686
Other's from her dentist.

33:14.395 --> 33:15.881
How long is it
going to take you ?

33:15.902 --> 33:17.078
That's hard to say.

33:18.558 --> 33:19.734
Mr. James,

33:20.328 --> 33:23.571
was Clara by any chance
seeing an older man ?

33:23.984 --> 33:26.392
As far as I know,
she wasn't seeing anybody

33:26.392 --> 33:28.731
but it wouldn't
surprise me if she was.

33:28.732 --> 33:31.608
Clara wasn't smart
when it come to people,

33:31.852 --> 33:34.861
talking to any lowlife chump
who'd give her the time of day.

33:35.506 --> 33:38.718
The girl never did listen
to a damn word I said.

33:39.090 --> 33:40.202
The older man...

33:40.761 --> 33:41.533
um...

33:41.831 --> 33:43.680
could've been someone
she met at school ?

33:45.381 --> 33:47.104
Did she have a part-time job ?

33:48.094 --> 33:50.227
Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.

33:50.999 --> 33:54.574
We found a number of half-eaten
Gooeybunz in the car.

33:55.002 --> 33:57.575
You know, Clara wasn't
really that smart

33:57.575 --> 34:00.590
about her diet either,
but she hated those things.

34:00.899 --> 34:02.384
Smell'd get into her clothes.

34:02.392 --> 34:05.831
By the time she got home,
she practically ready to throw up.

34:08.498 --> 34:10.652
You find out who did this...

34:11.366 --> 34:12.471
you let me know.

34:12.561 --> 34:13.092
Yeah.

34:16.937 --> 34:18.885
According
to Clara James' father,

34:18.893 --> 34:20.135
Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.911
She didn't like them,
which means

34:21.920 --> 34:24.565
it was either the killer
or the male DB.

34:25.552 --> 34:27.853
So we're looking for...

34:28.094 --> 34:29.245
bite marks ?

34:29.516 --> 34:30.962
If we find a good impression,

34:30.978 --> 34:32.981
maybe we'll get an ID
through dental records.

34:33.215 --> 34:33.952
You got it.

34:34.261 --> 34:37.101
And the student
becomes a master.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.623
I'm not seeing
any bite marks.

34:52.228 --> 34:53.420
Me either.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.204
It's not like they
were bitten at all.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.726
More like torn apart.

35:00.157 --> 35:01.676
Check it out.

35:02.239 --> 35:04.164
They might all be in pieces...

35:05.480 --> 35:06.964
but they're all still here.

35:07.615 --> 35:09.127
No one ever ate any of them.

35:10.202 --> 35:12.294
Which is kinda weird.
I mean, why

35:12.301 --> 35:14.483
buy all of 'em and not eat 'em ?

35:17.822 --> 35:21.064
I found this one
under a passenger seat--

35:21.073 --> 35:23.705
intact, on the floor.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.469
It escaped the carnage.

35:46.667 --> 35:48.198
That's not frosting.

35:50.270 --> 35:52.191
I always liked
the middle part the best.

35:53.262 --> 35:56.295
When she parks her car,
she's a hot housewife.

35:56.365 --> 35:59.741
A few hours later,
she's just another freak.

36:05.582 --> 36:06.944
It's my Mercedes, okay ?

36:06.955 --> 36:08.615
I can prove it. Just
give me the keys.

36:08.618 --> 36:10.964
- Show me ten bucks
or you ain't proving squat.
- I don't have anywhere to go !

36:11.263 --> 36:12.625
Brooke Harris probably spent

36:12.629 --> 36:15.075
- ten bucks a day on nonfat lattes.
- Right.

36:15.724 --> 36:17.914
She needed money
to get her car back.

36:18.456 --> 36:20.569
Well, I don't see
any ATMs around here.

36:20.790 --> 36:22.736
This is a bad place
to be broke.

36:22.736 --> 36:24.031
Hey, you miss me ?

36:37.074 --> 36:38.867
Rusty flakes.

36:40.371 --> 36:42.541
Hey, Michaels, did you put
this crime tape up ?

36:42.689 --> 36:43.397
Yes, sir.

36:47.645 --> 36:49.228
Yeah, well,
you missed something.

36:49.282 --> 36:50.898
There's blood on this rebar.

36:53.287 --> 36:54.637
Where'd you find that ?

36:55.753 --> 36:57.390
I, uh... I just picked it up
over there...

37:16.357 --> 37:17.693
May I ask you a question ?

37:19.558 --> 37:21.036
Do you recognize this woman ?

37:22.346 --> 37:23.618
She's a thief.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.968
She took some money
out of my hat.

37:33.475 --> 37:35.332
Hey ! Hey !

37:43.535 --> 37:45.587
Stealing's a crime.

37:48.325 --> 37:49.440
Hey, Michaels.

37:50.100 --> 37:53.855
Think you might be able to
take this man into custody ?

38:01.249 --> 38:03.019
Tox confirmed that
the packet in the Gooeybun

38:03.022 --> 38:05.238
contained cocaine,
and one of the prints that

38:05.243 --> 38:07.371
I lifted off the Grand Am
was a felony conviction

38:07.374 --> 38:11.497
for cocaine trafficking--
Joey Zack, drug dealer.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.520
seems he liked to use
Gooeybunz to move his coke.

38:19.237 --> 38:21.449
He's a nice regular
customer at Gooeybunz.

38:21.449 --> 38:23.944
He used to chat up cute Clara
when he was there,

38:24.077 --> 38:25.778
sweet-talks her into a date,

38:25.865 --> 38:28.194
and they both end up dead
in his bitchin' Grand Am.

38:28.285 --> 38:30.487
Well, whoever did it
must've done it for the drugs.

38:30.579 --> 38:33.121
GCMS on the melted gloves
from your Grand Am.

38:33.646 --> 38:36.632
A delicious confection
of sugar, gelatin, starches,

38:36.756 --> 38:38.512
citric acid, mineral oil,

38:38.515 --> 38:42.098
Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1
and carnauba wax,

38:42.232 --> 38:42.867
Candy.

38:43.305 --> 38:44.301
Gummy candy.

38:44.730 --> 38:46.869
I'm partial to Jujubes myself.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.720
Is it something I said ?

38:48.736 --> 38:49.410
Probably.

38:50.474 --> 38:52.990
Joey Zack's print
was found on the radio,

38:53.153 --> 38:55.533
which was tuned to 107 FM.

38:55.578 --> 38:58.357
Now, as far as I know,
there is only one place in town

38:58.364 --> 39:01.982
where you can get gummies,
a generic cheeseburger,

39:01.995 --> 39:06.872
and 107.1 gets anything
other than static.

39:10.106 --> 39:11.607
Sorry, I don't recognize him.

39:11.678 --> 39:13.723
Most of the time when people
come here, it's dark.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.677
How about this ?
You ever seen this car before ?

39:15.759 --> 39:18.413
No, all I remember from
the last two weeks is

39:18.578 --> 39:21.177
what's playing 'cause
I've seen it 8,000 times.

39:21.606 --> 39:22.576
Killer Punch.

39:22.812 --> 39:24.492
A big draw for crap cars.

39:24.802 --> 39:26.730
We're gonna need
to talk to your employees.

39:26.733 --> 39:27.893
Oh, come on, please.

39:27.902 --> 39:29.313
Is that really necessary ?

39:29.383 --> 39:31.149
It's a homicide investigation.

39:31.642 --> 39:33.992
We could just call the
health inspector and...

39:34.157 --> 39:36.172
see how many code violations
he has festering

39:36.172 --> 39:37.430
in that concession stand.

39:37.503 --> 39:39.689
Geez, fine,
knock yourselves out.

39:40.206 --> 39:41.497
Jerry's on tickets...

39:41.600 --> 39:44.043
Maddox runs the projector,
and Darryl's in concessions.

39:44.049 --> 39:44.504
No.

39:44.907 --> 39:46.284
No, he quit last week.

39:46.749 --> 39:47.462
Why ?

39:47.872 --> 39:50.727
He said he was gonna go live
with his parents up in Mesquite.

39:52.442 --> 39:54.101
Guy's name is Darryl Blakeny.

39:54.266 --> 39:57.338
Small-time hood with priors
for B&E and possession.

39:57.414 --> 39:59.941
His prints were on the
steering wheel of the Grand Am.

40:00.312 --> 40:02.079
When he quit his job
at the drive-in,

40:02.079 --> 40:03.902
he was in court-ordered rehab.

40:03.954 --> 40:07.481
We figured Blakeny was one
of Joey Zack's customers.

40:07.702 --> 40:10.832
One night, Blakeny
sees his coke dealer's Grand Am

40:10.843 --> 40:12.215
at the drive-in, and

40:12.303 --> 40:13.520
the fiend snaps.

40:17.677 --> 40:19.557
Move, and you're dead !
Shut up !

40:19.574 --> 40:20.702
All right, all right,
all right !

40:20.702 --> 40:22.162
Give me the coke, Joey !

40:25.291 --> 40:27.039
Do we know where he killed them ?

40:27.591 --> 40:28.766
We don't know where yet.

40:28.775 --> 40:29.638
Or why.

40:29.964 --> 40:31.832
Maybe the girl
started freaking out ;

40:31.848 --> 40:33.714
maybe Blakeny's just a psycho.

40:34.133 --> 40:34.645
Anyway,

40:34.881 --> 40:37.179
uh, Blakeny tossed the bodies,

40:37.182 --> 40:39.511
and throws them in the trunk
and drives home.

40:40.224 --> 40:42.211
The street where
the Grand Am was found

40:42.340 --> 40:44.543
is a block away from
his last known residence.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.631
He leaves it there
collecting parking tickets,

40:46.640 --> 40:48.493
skips town,
and uses the same gun

40:48.498 --> 40:51.519
two days later in another
drug-related crime in Mesquite.

40:51.619 --> 40:53.686
The scumbag's still in the wind.

40:54.427 --> 40:57.043
At least he's in the system
with a double homicide.

40:57.324 --> 41:00.391
That's not going to satisfy
Clara James' father.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.263
Can she cook ?
Is she a good cook ?

41:05.747 --> 41:07.382
Come on, Warrick.
Hey, Grissom.

41:07.962 --> 41:10.008
We're taking Warrick
to the Pepper Mill

41:10.016 --> 41:11.257
to celebrate his marriage

41:11.262 --> 41:13.679
and to condemn his elopement.

41:13.745 --> 41:14.297
You in ?

41:14.506 --> 41:15.837
Did you invite your wife ?

41:16.307 --> 41:19.468
I don't think I'm ready to
subject her to the crew just yet.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.022
I got to beg off, you guys.

41:21.037 --> 41:22.404
Got to take Lindsay to school.

41:22.483 --> 41:23.121
All right.

41:23.340 --> 41:23.821
Bye.

41:24.070 --> 41:24.491
Bye.

41:25.678 --> 41:26.309
So ?

41:26.818 --> 41:28.257
I got one more thing to do.

41:28.631 --> 41:29.151
All right.

41:31.114 --> 41:31.556
Don't.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.986
<i>So, breathe quick.</i>

41:35.371 --> 41:36.390
<i>Breathe slow.</i>

41:37.267 --> 41:40.329
<i>Put your gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.</i>

41:41.410 --> 41:42.746
<i>Any way you like,</i>

41:43.566 --> 41:45.221
<i>you're going to die here.</i>

41:46.964 --> 41:47.796
<i>Okay ?</i>

41:48.195 --> 41:48.810
<i>Perfect.</i>

41:52.260 --> 41:52.835
<i>Okay ?</i>

41:53.189 --> 41:53.765
<i>Perfect.</i>

41:56.303 --> 41:57.553
How'd you know it
was going to be there ?

41:57.561 --> 41:59.020
If that "okay" had
been meant for Nick,

41:59.126 --> 42:01.160
it wouldn't have been
in the form of a question.

42:01.735 --> 42:04.994
I think maybe Walter Gordon
had an accomplice.

42:08.194 --> 42:08.857
<i>Perfect.</i>

42:09.894 --> 42:11.007
Male or female ?

42:12.072 --> 42:13.510
It's, um...

42:14.201 --> 42:15.307
hard to say.

42:15.860 --> 42:17.291
The tape was pretty mangled.

42:17.531 --> 42:19.328
Enhancement
and noise cancellation

42:19.328 --> 42:21.001
increase intelligibility, but

42:21.017 --> 42:22.698
it alters timber and tone.

42:24.029 --> 42:25.855
I don't know there's
any more I can do here.

42:27.770 --> 42:28.948
You know,
Nick recorded a message

42:28.948 --> 42:30.002
on the flip side of the tape.

42:30.241 --> 42:31.909
- You think maybe we should...
- No.

42:33.472 --> 42:35.216
This is between you and me.
