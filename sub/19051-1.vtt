Attention!

00:06.480 --> 00:08.736
[ Door Closes ] Attention, everyone.
Gather around, please.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.800
Gather round. Mac has a very
important announcement!

00:11.920 --> 00:15.163
Because of my sudden
and unfortunate weight loss,

00:15.240 --> 00:17.891
the bar is now in extreme risk,

00:17.960 --> 00:21.089
and as head of security,
this concerns me.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.322
So Mac's made a couple of moves.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.485
And that first move...
is this.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.164
Jesus Christ.
Jesus.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.685
Perfect for ocular pat downs.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.643
Now I can determine
a subject's threat level...

00:32.759 --> 00:34.840
without him being able to
feel my retinal assessment.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.850
V\/hich is a great advantage because
the guy can't see how scared Mac is.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.456
Yes, and-No, that's
not what it's about.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.130
Huh?
It's not about him-

00:41.240 --> 00:43.656
I thought you were soared every time
you went to-That's classified!

00:43.680 --> 00:46.445
Look, this whole point is to
make them feel safer, all right?

00:46.560 --> 00:50.246
We don't feel safer. And there will never
come a time where you will need those.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.850
Mark my words, Dennis.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.096
There will come a time when I
will utilize these glasses...

00:54.120 --> 00:56.441
to assess a threat,
and then-

00:56.520 --> 00:58.576
- Are they still standing there?
- No, they walked away.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.409
My peripheral
is a little compromised.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.882

whether that old Nazi bitch lives or dies?

That is correct.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.008
Yeah, all right.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.321
Did you like my whole-my whole
thing I was doing there?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.687
[ Chuckles ]
Nah.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.327
[ Monitor Beeps ] I need
final verbal confirmation.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.721
Yes. Just do it already.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.928
Wow. What an asshole,
huh, Doctor?

18:47.040 --> 18:49.056
You are killing a man. You
know that, right? [ Scoffs ]

18:49.080 --> 18:51.376
There's a lot of mercy in this decision.
I commend it. Oh, you commend-

18:51.400 --> 18:54.161
Well, I mean, technically we gave the
order to him to give to you, so-

18:54.200 --> 18:57.124
Yeah, if you feel like commending-If
you're in the mood for commending-

18:57.240 --> 18:59.216
if you're gonna throw some
oommendations around, you know, just-

18:59.240 --> 19:01.447
[ Dee ] We'll take 'em.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.688
[ Exhales ] V\/ow. [ Whistles ]

19:10.760 --> 19:13.730
[Continuous Beeping ]

19:13.880 --> 19:15.896
[ Regular Beeping Resumes ] Uh-oh.
Here we go. What is that?

19:15.920 --> 19:20.323
Uh, he seems to be breathing on his own.
That happens sometimes.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.325
Uh, how long until he's...
not breathing on his own?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.050
Until he perishes?
Right.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.168
Could be months, weeks, days.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.288
Who knows?
He's a fighter, this one.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.203
Son of a bitch.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.964
Well, if you'll excuse me,

19:34.040 --> 19:37.089
we've had an incredible amount of
stray dog attacks all over the city,

19:37.160 --> 19:39.925
so our E.R. is slammed.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.011
Hnnn. hmnnm [Snofls]

19:44.120 --> 19:45.963
Well, you know what?
It's okay. Let's go.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.016
He had nothing of value to leave us anyway.
Yeah, come on.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.611
Well, actually, he did.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.767
Burn, baby, burn!

19:53.880 --> 19:55.530
Dude, I'm still psyched
about this movie.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.416
Okay, but the ending
needs a little bit of work,

19:57.440 --> 19:59.176
'cause nobody cares about
an original Charlie Kelly.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.202
Well, it's not an original,
you know.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.204
I just painted over one of the old
paintings that he gave me, so-

20:04.280 --> 20:06.044
Who?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.645
Pop-Pop.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.768
So Pop-Pop did give you
the painting?

20:09.840 --> 20:13.003
It was in the box ofjunk that he
gave me, but it's just trash.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.128
That's an even worse ending.
It's so complicated.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.850
I can't even follow
the goddamn story.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.570
L-I don't care.
Dude-Gosling.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.130
[ Charlie ]
Gosling cannot play you!
