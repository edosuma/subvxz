WEBVTT

00:00.273 --> 00:01.137
I- yet!

00:01.174 --> 00:02.539
Tahh!

00:04.577 --> 00:06.841
He tried to turn me into sashimi!

00:06.879 --> 00:10.713
A rare Japanese porcelain plate
has been stolen.

00:10.750 --> 00:14.550
- Why is he wearing that outfit?
- Tozan is a samurai warrior.

00:14.587 --> 00:18.887
- In your own way, you're a samurai too.
- What are we samurai gonna do tonight?

00:18.925 --> 00:23.589
Do you know those Yakuza guys
cut off their own finger if they screw up?

00:23.629 --> 00:25.256
Yeah, right!

03:09.996 --> 03:11.122
Je-cha-at!

03:15.101 --> 03:16.090
Chet!

03:18.404 --> 03:19.769
Aargh!

03:21.774 --> 03:23.742
Ahh! Cha!

03:26.779 --> 03:28.110
Chet!

03:35.088 --> 03:36.612
Ah-ah!

03:41.027 --> 03:42.016
Cha!

03:44.831 --> 03:45.820
Argh.

03:46.799 --> 03:47.925
Ahh!

04:01.647 --> 04:03.740
Higgins! I'm gonna...

04:04.150 --> 04:06.744
Before you utter any epithets
you may regret,

04:06.786 --> 04:10.552
let me just say you have shown
a flagrant disregard for your word.

04:10.590 --> 04:13.582
Does honor have any meaning
for you at all?

04:13.626 --> 04:17.892
Yes! But what's that have to do with
you spraying that stuff in my face?

04:17.930 --> 04:20.956
- Dog repellent.
- Dog repellent?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.663
I was just giving you a taste
of what you've been giving the lads.

04:24.704 --> 04:26.729
No wonder they detest you so.

04:26.772 --> 04:31.175
I thought you'd gotten rid of this substance.
You gave me your word.

04:31.210 --> 04:33.872
- I did?
- You did.

04:33.913 --> 04:38.646
- How do you know the stuff is mine?
- Because I found it on your mantel.

04:38.684 --> 04:41.016
A- ha! You violated my privacy!

04:41.053 --> 04:43.851
I was retrieving Mr. Masters' wide-angle lens

04:43.890 --> 04:47.587
which you borrowed three weeks ago
and neglected to return.

04:47.627 --> 04:51.154
That doesn't give you the right
to remove my possessions.

04:51.197 --> 04:55.258
I consider this contraband
and therefore subject to confiscation.

04:55.301 --> 05:00.295
As long as there are dogs threatening my
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,

05:00.339 --> 05:05.367
I will... No, I must, I must protect myself!

05:05.411 --> 05:07.936
It is my constitutional right!

05:08.581 --> 05:14.178
Very well. I will inform Mr. Masters
that you feel within your constitutional rights

05:14.220 --> 05:16.279
to use dog repellent on the lads.

05:16.322 --> 05:18.017
Hey, hey, hey...

05:22.562 --> 05:25.690
No sense bothering Robin
with a little household problem.

05:25.731 --> 05:28.894
Sorry, Magnum,
it isn't a little household problem to me,

05:28.935 --> 05:31.699
nor do I believe it will be to Mr. Masters.

05:31.737 --> 05:36.231
OK. OK, Higgins,
what is it you want?

05:39.145 --> 05:42.808
A rare Japanese porcelain plate,
a Kenzan original,

05:43.416 --> 05:45.907
was to have been delivered six hours ago

05:45.952 --> 05:48.250
by a special courier named Tozan.

05:48.287 --> 05:50.778
He is registered at the Kalani Hotel.

05:50.823 --> 05:54.156
If you will find out what has happened,
I will not inform Mr. Masters

05:54.193 --> 05:57.026
of the presence of dog repellent
in your room.

05:57.063 --> 06:01.591
You know something, Higgins,
you make living here a real challenge.

06:01.634 --> 06:02.965
Thank you.

06:08.674 --> 06:12.166
Magnum, you must recover
the Kenzan immediately.

06:12.211 --> 06:16.944
Mr. Masters plans to give it to a Honolulu
museum for an unveiling three days hence.

06:16.983 --> 06:21.613
- Sounds expensive. How much is it worth?
- A half-million wouldn't touch it.

06:21.654 --> 06:24.282
- A half-million dollars?
- Pounds.

06:24.824 --> 06:28.624
It's the finest example of porcelain
from the Edo Tokugawa period.

06:28.661 --> 06:32.825
Kenzan was one of the finest artists
the world has ever known.

06:32.865 --> 06:37.131
- A Japanese Picasso.
- You think this Tarzan guy skipped with it?

06:37.169 --> 06:42.038
Tozan has impeccable credentials.
His ethics are beyond reproach.

06:42.074 --> 06:46.704
Yeah? Well, a guy can ignore a lot of ethics
for half a million.

06:46.746 --> 06:51.479
- How much is that American?
- Approximately $867,500.

06:51.517 --> 06:53.348
He skipped.

06:54.387 --> 06:57.879
Magnum, for reasons
which are well beyond your grasp,

06:57.923 --> 07:02.951
it would never, I repeat never,
occur to Tozan to skip.

07:02.995 --> 07:07.159
- Why not, Higgins?
- Because Tozan is a samurai warrior.

07:08.301 --> 07:09.393
Mm.

07:09.435 --> 07:11.164
Mm-hm-hm-hm.

07:19.945 --> 07:24.541
<i>Samurai or not, it was obvious
the courier had skipped with the plate.</i>

07:24.583 --> 07:26.949
<i>I had as much chance
of finding him at his hotel</i>

07:26.986 --> 07:29.978
<i>as the Chicago Cubs do
of winning a pennant.</i>

07:30.022 --> 07:34.254
<i>Nevertheless, working rule number 23
of my yet-to-be-written handbook</i>

07:34.293 --> 07:40.095
<i>on how to be a private investigator dictates
that you must go through the motions.</i>

07:40.132 --> 07:43.260
<i>You never know, you could get lucky</i>.

07:43.302 --> 07:46.829
<i>Of course, so could the Cubs</i>.

07:46.872 --> 07:49.898
Yes, sir, Mr. Tozan is registered in <i>2</i> 1 <i>2</i> 7.

07:51.210 --> 07:54.475
- He is?
- Yes, sir. He said he's expecting you.

07:55.548 --> 07:56.537
Thank you.

07:58.517 --> 08:04.149
<i>Always
enter strange hotel rooms with caution,</i>

08:04.190 --> 08:07.853
<i>especially strange hotel rooms
with samurai warriors in them.</i>

08:07.893 --> 08:12.694
<i>Of course, the last samurai I saw
was in a Toshir√¥ Mifune movie.</i>

08:13.799 --> 08:14.788
I- yet!

08:14.834 --> 08:16.825
- Ah!
- Tahh!

08:16.869 --> 08:19.929
You wouldn't wanna
put that down for a minute?

08:40.292 --> 08:41.280
Ah!

08:41.327 --> 08:47.061
- I believe you two have already met.
- Met? He tried to turn me into sashimi!

08:47.099 --> 08:49.431
- Don't move.
- Don't worry.

08:51.504 --> 08:53.529
Ah.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.906
- Does it feel better?
- Oh, yeah. A little to the left.

08:58.944 --> 09:04.143
This guy almost killed me. Now he's making
like Florence Nightingale. Why? No offense.

09:04.183 --> 09:08.381
- Perhaps an explanation is in order.
- No "perhaps" about it, Higgins.

09:08.421 --> 09:09.410
Ah! Ooh!

09:09.455 --> 09:14.358
- A little to the right.
- Tozan says the plate has been stolen.

09:14.393 --> 09:17.794
Since he is a stranger in Hawaii,
he needs our help to recover it.

09:18.397 --> 09:21.298
But as the courier, naturally he is suspect,

09:21.333 --> 09:23.324
so, in order to prove his innocence,

09:23.369 --> 09:27.237
he placed you at his mercy
and then spared your life.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.107
Great. Couldn't he try a simple explanation?

09:31.877 --> 09:35.369
Words are like dried leaves
that have not yet fallen.

09:36.649 --> 09:40.016
- What?
- Tozan's point is well taken.

09:40.052 --> 09:42.714
If Tozan will permit me to paraphrase.

09:42.755 --> 09:46.384
One deed is worth a thousand explanations.

09:46.425 --> 09:48.052
Quite Zen.

09:49.228 --> 09:50.559
Quite.

09:51.864 --> 09:54.355
How was the plate stolen?

09:54.400 --> 09:59.770
As I told Higgins-san,
I took the Kenzan to the temple for blessing.

09:59.805 --> 10:04.265
There I was attacked by ninja
and the plate was stolen.

10:04.310 --> 10:05.299
Ninja?

10:06.345 --> 10:09.178
In Hawaii? In the <i>2</i> 0th century?

10:09.782 --> 10:12.945
- Most curious, no?
- Oh, yeah, sure!

10:12.985 --> 10:16.250
Why not? The whole thing
is perfectly clear to me!

10:16.288 --> 10:22.022
You beat me up to get my confidence
and then tell me about a bunch of guys

10:22.061 --> 10:27.693
in black robes who went out of style with
Commodore Perry and Madam Butterfly!

10:28.601 --> 10:30.592
Perhaps you hit him too hard.

10:37.009 --> 10:37.998
Yes?

10:39.678 --> 10:41.407
Yes, he's here.

10:42.081 --> 10:43.514
Tozan.

10:53.125 --> 10:57.289
Tozan called Mr. Fukuda, the man who sold
the plate to Robin Masters.

10:57.329 --> 11:00.821
- That's him calling back from Japan.
- Oh, sure, right!

11:00.866 --> 11:04.529
- Oh, my God!
- Perhaps you'd better sit down again.

11:06.105 --> 11:08.096
Why is he wearing that outfit?

11:08.140 --> 11:11.803
- I've told you.
- Oh, yes, I know, I forgot, he's a samurai.

11:11.844 --> 11:13.812
An Ichinaga samurai.

11:13.846 --> 11:15.837
They're world-renowned.

11:15.881 --> 11:19.942
I find it impossible to believe
that one would break his code of honor.

11:21.754 --> 11:25.747
- You really believe him.
- As a gentleman, I have no choice.

11:25.791 --> 11:29.090
Our cultures differ,
but we're of the same mold.

11:29.728 --> 11:32.288
Tozan knows no other road but the truth.

11:39.271 --> 11:40.260
Oh, my God.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.168
- What?
- I was afraid of that.

11:44.209 --> 11:46.200
What? Afraid of what?

11:49.682 --> 11:54.585
Tozan's assured Mr. Fukuda he will recover
the Kenzan before the museum opening.

11:55.287 --> 11:59.621
That's a bit optimistic, don't you think?
Unless he already has it.

11:59.658 --> 12:02.320
This should put your skepticism to rest.

12:02.361 --> 12:07.628
As it's a matter of honor, if Tozan is unable
to recover the plate before the opening,

12:07.666 --> 12:11.432
he will be obliged to commit Seppuku.

12:11.470 --> 12:13.461
Ritual suicide.

12:28.787 --> 12:32.484
<i>For a guy who was contemplating
bumping himself off,</i>

12:32.524 --> 12:35.118
<i>Tozan didn't look particularly worried</i>.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.720
<i>OK, he's just being Zen</i>.

12:37.762 --> 12:41.858
<i>What I couldn't understand
is what's the sense of trying to stay in shape</i>

12:41.900 --> 12:45.893
<i>if you're planning on shedding
some pounds the quick way?</i>

12:45.937 --> 12:50.101
Magnum, I've just had the disagreeable task

12:50.141 --> 12:53.975
of informing Mr. Masters
that the Kenzan has been stolen.

12:54.012 --> 12:58.847
Needless to say, he was quite disturbed.
I assured him that we would recover it.

12:58.883 --> 13:00.817
- We?
- Of course.

13:00.852 --> 13:05.949
You mean "we" meaning me. Why don't
"we" meaning you just call the police?

13:05.990 --> 13:11.257
We discussed that. I convinced Mr. Masters
we should temporarily delay informing them.

13:11.296 --> 13:14.561
Oh, great. Just great.
I can't wait to hear why.

13:14.599 --> 13:18.262
What, give Tozan time
to sharpen his swords?

13:18.303 --> 13:23.366
Your insensitivity knows no bounds.
Obviously Tozan would be a prime suspect.

13:23.775 --> 13:27.575
Precious time would be wasted
in questioning him. Time which...

13:27.612 --> 13:30.604
By "we" meaning me
chasing down six ninjas?

13:30.648 --> 13:35.312
Who aren't ninjas cos there's no such thing
as ninjas anymore, or samurai!

13:35.353 --> 13:38.982
Besides, these ninjas who aren't ninjas
could be anywhere!

13:39.023 --> 13:42.789
Mostly likely somewhere in the back forty
of that guy's pigtail.

13:42.827 --> 13:45.318
- Call the police.
- You have three days.

13:46.164 --> 13:50.999
Even if I go out looking for that plate,
there's no guarantee I can find it.

13:51.035 --> 13:53.868
You don't think he'll really commit seppuki?

13:53.905 --> 13:56.135
Seppuku.

13:56.174 --> 13:59.337
Magnum, Tozan is a modern-day samurai.

13:59.377 --> 14:05.316
I assure you he will carry out his promise.
You see, he cannot do otherwise.

14:05.350 --> 14:07.614
His life is in your hands.

14:07.652 --> 14:09.882
My hands? What happened to our hands?

14:09.921 --> 14:11.912
I suggest you get cracking.

14:23.868 --> 14:28.032
- Ready to get cracking?
- You speak in riddles, Magnum-san.

14:28.072 --> 14:30.666
- So do you.
- Ah, I see.

14:30.708 --> 14:35.338
- What? See what?
- Can you not see what is before you?

14:36.047 --> 14:40.541
What I see before me is a guy
who seems totally unconcerned

14:40.585 --> 14:43.611
at the prospect of killing himself
over the loss of a plate.

14:43.655 --> 14:48.490
How do you expect me to take your story
seriously? You're so calm and relaxed.

14:48.526 --> 14:53.020
- Is it not a beautiful afternoon?
- It's great, but that's not the point.

14:53.064 --> 14:54.395
Ah.

14:54.432 --> 14:58.698
- Ah? "Ah" what?
- I am a samurai, Magnum-san.

14:58.736 --> 15:02.137
I live by a code. It gives meaning to life.

15:02.173 --> 15:05.438
Just as you may drive your car
faster than necessary

15:05.477 --> 15:08.776
to give your journey added meaning,
danger perhaps.

15:09.314 --> 15:11.509
But this is life and death.

15:11.549 --> 15:13.779
Ah, you understand.

15:13.818 --> 15:15.979
We will get cracking, Magnum-san.

15:17.489 --> 15:19.150
Ah.

15:21.459 --> 15:25.623
Sorry, Thomas,
but this ninja stuff is a bit out of my line.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.597
Yes, why don't we forget the ninja,

15:27.632 --> 15:31.329
bypass them altogether
and go straight to Shogun?

15:31.369 --> 15:34.930
- Come on, guys!
- Where did you get this crackpot?

15:34.973 --> 15:36.964
I didn't get him. Higgins did.

15:37.008 --> 15:41.308
Look, his name is Tozan
and he's a samurai.

15:41.346 --> 15:43.007
Well, he thinks he's a samurai.

15:43.047 --> 15:47.609
He tried to deliver this plate to Higgins
that was worth half a million pounds.

15:48.987 --> 15:53.981
And these ninja,
they stole the plate from him at this temple.

15:55.960 --> 16:01.125
Come on, guys, just cut it out, will you?
He's putting his life on the line for this.

16:01.165 --> 16:06.159
Well, you know those samurai, they'll
pull the plug at the drop of a kimono! Oops!

16:07.639 --> 16:10.005
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Thomas,

16:10.041 --> 16:13.033
but this is just too far-fetched.

16:13.077 --> 16:16.444
- What's the gag?
- There is no gag. I need your help.

16:19.217 --> 16:22.050
- OK, say we believe you...
- No, no, no.

16:22.086 --> 16:25.681
Say we believe you, what's in it for us?

16:25.723 --> 16:28.954
Well, I'm sure Robin Masters
will reward you generously.

16:28.993 --> 16:32.656
Oh, there's this guy Fukuda...

16:33.464 --> 16:38.424
You see, he sold the plate to Robin
and I bet you he'll throw in some bucks, too.

16:38.469 --> 16:41.632
Oh, sure, he will. Sure!

16:41.673 --> 16:46.337
All right, all right, come on, come on.
What do we gotta do to get it?

16:46.377 --> 16:49.244
Shave our heads and go undercover?

16:49.280 --> 16:51.510
Come on, guys, cut it out.

16:51.549 --> 16:55.007
All you gotta do is check
your Yakuza contacts, like I said.

16:55.753 --> 16:59.314
We gotta find out who hired these ninja...

16:59.357 --> 17:02.622
and how they knew about Tozan
and the plate. Come on!

17:02.660 --> 17:05.720
Come on, will you help me? Please?

17:05.762 --> 17:07.731
- No.
- No.

17:23.513 --> 17:28.645
- That was very impressive.
- It was logical. Now they understand.

17:28.686 --> 17:33.680
I think I'm beginning to understand too.
So what next? The temple?

17:34.692 --> 17:36.887
That is not logical, Magnum-san.

17:36.928 --> 17:39.419
The ninja are long gone.

17:39.464 --> 17:43.958
Oh, yeah, of course.
So the airport? Hotel?

17:44.002 --> 17:48.098
There is nothing to be found out
that my enemies do not already know

17:48.139 --> 17:50.437
and have already taken advantage of.

17:50.475 --> 17:54.673
- There is nothing else to do.
- Of course there is, Tozan.

17:54.712 --> 17:57.579
One cannot push for answers,
Magnum-san.

17:57.615 --> 18:02.643
One must wait
and find pleasure in the waiting.

18:02.687 --> 18:06.145
Tozan, clues... do not just come to you.

18:06.190 --> 18:10.593
You gotta go out and dig,
you gotta follow leads, talk to people.

18:10.628 --> 18:15.759
Aren't your friends, T.C. and Rick,
now doing this important job?

18:15.800 --> 18:19.429
Sure, but we can't just sit around and wait.
We gotta do something.

18:19.470 --> 18:24.703
Don't worry, Magnum-san,
progress is being made.

18:24.742 --> 18:27.142
Surely you must understand

18:27.178 --> 18:30.147
for, in your own way, you are a samurai too.

18:31.015 --> 18:35.008
- I am?
- You are more a samurai than you think.

18:35.887 --> 18:37.377
Well...

18:39.057 --> 18:41.389
what are we samurai gonna do tonight -

18:41.426 --> 18:44.327
sit around and wait
for clues to drop in our laps?

18:44.362 --> 18:49.390
Yes, tonight we will learn the lesson
of the arrow that is not aimed.

19:03.147 --> 19:04.774
Hi, guys.

19:06.017 --> 19:08.850
Tozan... I don't know about this.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.478
Sit.

19:18.629 --> 19:24.625
You know, maybe I oughta check
and see how Rick and T.C. are doing.

19:29.974 --> 19:34.308
You know, I still think
we oughta be out chasing down leads.

19:34.345 --> 19:37.337
I mean, that's what private investigators do.

19:49.327 --> 19:52.160
They chase down leads... and stuff.

20:18.356 --> 20:21.382
This is great. It's very relaxing.

20:25.062 --> 20:29.556
- Man, I do not like this.
- Come on, T.C., it'll be a piece of cake.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.559
I'll be the big operator from the mainland.
You'll be my muscle.

20:33.604 --> 20:39.907
How come I can't be the big operator from
the mainland and you be my... Never mind.

20:41.546 --> 20:45.676
- You're getting nervous in your old age.
- I got enough sense to be nervous.

20:45.716 --> 20:50.244
Do you know those Yakuza guys
cut off their own finger if they screw up?

20:50.288 --> 20:54.554
Imagine what they'll do to us
if they don't believe your crazy story.

20:54.592 --> 20:56.924
What's not to believe?

20:56.961 --> 20:59.225
<i>I find this very hard to believe</i>.

21:01.365 --> 21:05.802
In fact, I find it extremely improbable.

21:05.837 --> 21:07.702
All we want is some information.

21:07.738 --> 21:11.139
Mori Miyashiro said you owed him a favor.
He owes me a favor.

21:11.175 --> 21:14.167
He's passing the favor on to me.

21:14.212 --> 21:17.807
- In other words, I owe you a favor?
- Right.

21:18.783 --> 21:19.772
Well, kinda.

21:23.821 --> 21:26.619
Wait here until I check this out
with Miyashiro.

21:26.657 --> 21:30.252
Wait a minute. Finding Mori's
about as hard as finding Anthony Quinn.

21:30.294 --> 21:34.162
It could take hours.
It took me hours to find him.

21:34.198 --> 21:37.895
- We'll just give you a jingle in the morning...
- Yeah, right...

21:39.337 --> 21:42.033
You'll wait here if it takes all night.

21:42.073 --> 21:44.132
- All night?
- All night.

21:46.510 --> 21:50.310
I wanna kill him.
Wherever he is, I am going to kill him.

21:51.349 --> 21:56.013
You were saying something about
the lesson of the arrow that is not aimed.

21:56.053 --> 22:00.217
It is an old discipline
practiced by the Ichinaga samurai.

22:00.258 --> 22:04.319
The bow is pulled, the archer
has no thought of his aim,

22:04.362 --> 22:06.057
the arrow,

22:06.097 --> 22:09.123
his game, or even of himself.

22:09.166 --> 22:13.398
All is one. All is emptiness.

22:13.437 --> 22:17.066
Yet the arrow always finds its target.

22:20.811 --> 22:25.214
When we were playing football,
we called it being in the groove.

22:25.249 --> 22:27.979
Everything just... worked.

22:28.753 --> 22:31.221
The pass, the pattern, the blocking,

22:31.989 --> 22:34.082
and boom - touchdown.

22:35.626 --> 22:38.220
Ah, you do understand.

22:40.498 --> 22:44.992
It's like the universe in a small, quiet pond.

22:45.036 --> 22:47.630
Each movement contains everything.

22:47.672 --> 22:52.075
Even so simple a thing as serving tea
becomes a prayer.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.141
Wonder how Rick and T.C...?

23:00.985 --> 23:04.079
No, I'm sure they're doing just fine.

23:08.592 --> 23:10.583
Thank you, Sheila. Tea?

23:13.030 --> 23:15.021
No, thanks.

23:17.201 --> 23:22.138
- How long are you gonna keep us here?
- Till I hear from Miyashiro.

23:22.173 --> 23:24.198
What happens if you don't hear from him?

23:28.212 --> 23:30.271
Don't ask.

23:42.827 --> 23:45.091
Excuse me, Magnum-san,

23:45.129 --> 23:49.225
but sake is most powerful
if one is not used to it.

23:50.001 --> 23:52.162
Don't worry, Tozan-san...

23:53.571 --> 23:55.038
I have had sake before.

24:03.114 --> 24:07.949
Magnum-san, will you do me the honor
of being my kaishaku?

24:09.620 --> 24:13.784
- Your what?
- I don't know the English word for it.

24:13.824 --> 24:18.625
It's like a colleague, a partner, a friend.

24:18.662 --> 24:20.391
Ah!

24:21.432 --> 24:27.029
In that case, I would be happy
to be your kai... whatever you call it.

24:28.105 --> 24:29.094
Kaishaku.

24:32.276 --> 24:34.267
Now my mind is at peace.

24:36.547 --> 24:38.037
L'chaim.

26:16.346 --> 26:21.045
<i>After Tozan's nimble fingers, the hammer
in my head was only pounding half as hard</i>

26:21.084 --> 26:24.247
<i>and I was at least able
to communicate coherently.</i>

26:24.287 --> 26:26.448
<i>At least, I thought I was coherent</i>.

26:27.457 --> 26:32.451
- First time in Hawaii?
- No, I was here once before during the war.

26:32.495 --> 26:34.224
During the war? When?

26:35.231 --> 26:36.892
1941.

26:38.635 --> 26:41.160
What progress have you made?

26:41.204 --> 26:45.106
We've been checking some sources,
running down some leads.

26:45.141 --> 26:48.633
You don't have any idea
where the Kenzan is, do you?

26:48.678 --> 26:50.509
- No.
- Tozan has failed.

26:50.547 --> 26:53.846
No. He was attacked by six thieves.
What could he do?

26:53.883 --> 26:57.785
- He has sworn to protect it with his life.
- But he was Maced.

26:58.788 --> 27:03.122
Tozan, would you explain to him
what happened, please?

27:03.159 --> 27:06.322
There is nothing to say. Fukuda-san is right.

27:08.965 --> 27:12.799
Mr. Fukuda...
do you know what he's planning to do?

27:13.937 --> 27:18.772
Of course. And the longer he delays,
the more his honor suffers.

27:18.808 --> 27:22.471
You're both nuts!
You're telling him to kill himself over a plate!

27:22.512 --> 27:26.209
I tell Tozan nothing.
His code tells him everything.

27:28.385 --> 27:34.381
Thank you for reminding me of my honor.
I will arrange for my Seppuku immediately.

27:55.879 --> 27:59.713
- Sunrise?
- That's what he said. Tomorrow.

27:59.749 --> 28:04.914
- On Mr. Masters' property?
- No, he said he'd go down to the beach.

28:04.954 --> 28:07.946
I suppose there is public access.

28:07.991 --> 28:10.983
A man is talking about
killing himself tomorrow

28:11.027 --> 28:14.554
and you're worried
about blood on the bougainvilleas?

28:14.597 --> 28:16.997
Magnum, you astound me sometimes.

28:17.033 --> 28:21.367
I abhor death, but I understand
and respect Tozan's point of view.

28:21.404 --> 28:26.000
We're just gonna have to talk him
out of his point of view, aren't we?

28:26.042 --> 28:29.534
Maybe I can do it. I'm his kaishuka.

28:29.579 --> 28:30.841
You're his what?

28:32.015 --> 28:37.351
Oh... kaishaku. It's a kind of a partner.
It's his blood brother or something.

28:37.387 --> 28:41.289
Magnum, a kaishaku
is the equivalent of a duelling second.

28:41.324 --> 28:44.191
He wants you to assist him in his Seppuku.

28:44.227 --> 28:46.889
Actually, you're honor-bound to do so.

28:51.901 --> 28:55.234
- You're just trying to scare me.
- No, I'm not.

28:55.271 --> 28:57.899
After Tozan has disembowelled himself
with his dirk,

28:57.941 --> 29:00.774
you must use his sword to cut off his head

29:00.810 --> 29:04.974
otherwise Tozan might risk losing face
by crying out.

29:07.784 --> 29:12.187
- Will you really give the guy a chop?
- No! What have you guys got?

29:12.222 --> 29:16.716
The Yakuza said a Japanese objet d'art
is available on the black market.

29:16.759 --> 29:19.592
- The seller wants plenty for it.
- The Kenzan?

29:19.629 --> 29:22.792
How many Japanese objets d'art
have been stolen?

29:22.832 --> 29:26.495
- Who's got it?
- A guy by the name of Gallagher.

29:26.536 --> 29:31.564
- He's got a souvenir shop on the docks.
- He also does some fencing on the side.

29:31.608 --> 29:34.236
Thanks, guys, I really appreciate this.

29:34.277 --> 29:39.305
You oughta take better care of yourselves.
Your clothes look like you slept in 'em.

29:53.830 --> 29:58.233
Tozan, listen to me.
You said our job was to wait.

29:58.268 --> 30:00.202
Something would come to us.

30:00.236 --> 30:03.330
Well, now it has
and we've got a trail to follow.

30:05.008 --> 30:06.669
Tozan?

30:10.079 --> 30:14.345
Look, now that we've got the clue,
we've got to follow it.

30:14.384 --> 30:16.318
Our duty is to find the Kenzan.

30:17.187 --> 30:19.883
You think you failed Fukuda.

30:20.924 --> 30:24.257
Your real failure...
will be if you don't help me now.

30:27.197 --> 30:30.792
I will help you until sunrise, Magnum-san.

30:30.833 --> 30:34.030
You can't put a time limit on your life.

30:34.871 --> 30:38.238
Of course I can. Life is not infinite.

30:49.652 --> 30:53.850
<i>If life itself wasn't infinite,
neither were the leads we had to go on.</i>

30:53.890 --> 30:57.382
<i>I was worried
that Tozan's rather bizarre appearance</i>

30:57.427 --> 31:00.021
<i>might jeopardize
the give and take of information</i>

31:00.063 --> 31:02.361
<i>between me and this Gallagher guy</i>.

31:02.398 --> 31:05.561
<i>It isn't every day
you see a samurai on the waterfront.</i>

31:05.602 --> 31:10.005
<i>Therefore,
I decided honesty was the best policy.</i>

31:10.840 --> 31:13.502
Tozan, you'd better let me handle this.

31:13.543 --> 31:17.138
If those ninja are in there,
they'll recognize you from the temple.

31:17.180 --> 31:22.117
- You will need help.
- Well... if I need you, I'll just whistle.

31:22.685 --> 31:26.143
- Whistle?
- You have your history and I have mine.

31:51.681 --> 31:53.649
Aloha. Can I help ya?

31:54.417 --> 31:57.250
Gee, I hope so.
I'm interested in Japanese pottery.

31:57.287 --> 32:01.348
Specifically 16th-century Kenzan porcelain.

32:01.391 --> 32:03.985
- Who are you?
- That's not important.

32:04.027 --> 32:06.962
Let's just say I'm a collector.

32:07.664 --> 32:13.193
Hey, look, I run a tourist junk factory. I don't
know anything about Japanese pottery.

32:13.236 --> 32:17.764
Gee, that's too bad because
this piece I'm looking for is worth 800 grand.

32:20.943 --> 32:23.605
Look, uh... maybe...

32:23.646 --> 32:25.238
maybe I'll look around.

32:25.281 --> 32:30.116
You never know,
maybe somebody might have a handle on it.

32:30.153 --> 32:33.145
- Where can I get a hold of you?
- Don't take too long.

32:33.189 --> 32:37.751
I'm leaving for the mainland tomorrow.
I'd hate to return without my... souvenir.

32:38.628 --> 32:40.926
Not to worry. You'll hear from me.

32:40.963 --> 32:42.157
Ay!

32:42.198 --> 32:43.825
Who the hell is that?

32:43.866 --> 32:48.132
- Oh, no.
- I am Tozan, samurai of the Ichinaga.

32:48.171 --> 32:52.164
I have come to claim the plate
which was stolen from me by your ninja.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.300
Tozan!

32:53.343 --> 32:57.006
I don't know what scam you're pulling,
but I don't have to take this.

32:57.046 --> 32:58.877
I will have it or your head!

32:58.915 --> 33:00.348
Cha!

33:03.753 --> 33:05.448
The plate!

33:05.488 --> 33:08.457
OK, OK. Just put the sword away.

33:20.169 --> 33:22.160
Tozan, this way! Come on!

33:27.477 --> 33:28.466
Ahh!

33:28.511 --> 33:31.139
- Now we gotta do it the hard way.
- Hard way?

33:31.180 --> 33:33.808
Yes, the Zen of the high-speed chase.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.456
I'll get him.

34:32.742 --> 34:34.232
I'll get him.

34:53.129 --> 34:55.529
I got him. I got...

35:15.852 --> 35:19.447
Call an ambulance.
You all right, buddy? You all right?

35:19.489 --> 35:22.287
He was down there a long time.
He's in bad shape.

36:12.775 --> 36:14.834
Magnum, what are you doing?

36:14.877 --> 36:17.437
- Higgins, it's a fake.
- What?

36:18.580 --> 36:19.911
A fake.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.471
How do you know?

36:26.688 --> 36:28.849
- Sunrise is...
- 5.02.

36:46.608 --> 36:48.269
Tozan!

36:49.545 --> 36:52.912
Oh, my kaishaku.
I have been waiting for you.

36:52.948 --> 36:55.109
Tozan, it's a fake.

36:57.853 --> 37:00.686
I thought you understood.
You disappoint me.

37:00.722 --> 37:02.553
Damn it, I'm not lying.

37:02.591 --> 37:05.992
Magnum has many faults
but lying is not one of them.

37:10.566 --> 37:12.363
You see the grit?

37:12.401 --> 37:14.232
- The Endo...
- Edo.

37:14.269 --> 37:16.430
The Edo Tokugawa period

37:16.472 --> 37:21.967
was characterized by porcelain-work using
clay of the finest type, virtually devoid of grit.

37:22.711 --> 37:25.043
Extraordinary.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.208
Magnum, you never cease to amaze me.

37:28.250 --> 37:32.914
How did you arrive at this astute conclusion
with your limited knowledge of art?

37:32.955 --> 37:36.118
Would you believe me
if I said it came to me in a dream?

37:36.158 --> 37:41.425
Yes, because your conscious mind isn't
capable of such superior detective work.

37:41.463 --> 37:45.126
Was there a moment
when a switch could have been made?

37:45.167 --> 37:49.501
- It never left my hands until the temple.
- Then Fukuda gave you a fake.

37:49.538 --> 37:53.201
- Impossible.
- Tozan, anything is possible.

37:53.242 --> 37:55.107
Not in this case.

37:55.144 --> 37:58.079
The Kenzan was authenticated
by Mr. Masters' representative,

37:58.113 --> 38:03.380
- just prior to Tozan taking possession.
- Fukuda-san put it into my hands himself.

38:03.418 --> 38:06.410
What was Gallagher doing
with such a well-made fake?

38:06.455 --> 38:09.219
Only Gallagher can say
and he can't share it with us.

38:09.258 --> 38:13.922
- He's gonna have to share it with us.
- How? He's in intensive care, unconscious.

38:13.962 --> 38:17.227
- I'll figure that out when I get there.
- Very Zen of you.

38:17.933 --> 38:19.423
Come on, Tozan.

38:22.504 --> 38:27.999
Tozan, if you're thinking about going back
out on the beach to pull your own plug,

38:28.043 --> 38:31.035
- you're gonna have to do it without my help.
- Magnum!

38:32.047 --> 38:36.108
- You are angry, Magnum-san. Why?
- I hate waste.

38:36.151 --> 38:39.484
I've seen a lifetime's worth of it... in Vietnam.

38:39.521 --> 38:41.250
Ah.

38:42.191 --> 38:45.092
To die a samurai is to give meaning to life,

38:45.127 --> 38:50.497
but to die a fool is merely to throw
one's life away. I will not die a fool.

39:05.447 --> 39:08.746
- You pulled me from the car.
- That's right.

39:08.784 --> 39:12.151
- Are you a cop?
- Private investigator.

39:13.555 --> 39:17.855
Investigators. This is my partner, Tozan.

39:17.893 --> 39:21.385
Look, we need to know
where you got the Kenzan.

39:21.430 --> 39:25.264
Did you have it stolen for yourself
or were you just fencing?

39:25.300 --> 39:26.392
Neither.

39:26.435 --> 39:27.766
I made it.

39:30.172 --> 39:33.437
You made it? It was nearly a perfect forgery.

39:34.309 --> 39:36.334
Thanks for the compliment.

39:38.347 --> 39:42.943
- How did you know it was a fake?
- Well, it got broken in the wreck.

39:42.985 --> 39:46.148
The clay had too much grit in it
for it to be a real Kenzan.

39:48.423 --> 39:52.416
- I never figured it would get broken.
- How did you do it?

39:52.461 --> 39:57.023
About a month ago, a man came to me.
He had the original.

39:57.065 --> 40:02.128
He wanted eleven copies.
A bodyguard stood around the whole time.

40:02.170 --> 40:05.571
He wouldn't let the original out of his sight

40:05.607 --> 40:10.169
and I had a hunch...
so I made an extra copy for myself.

40:11.046 --> 40:14.538
Then I got wind that
the real one was stolen.

40:15.584 --> 40:17.745
So you thought you'd cash in?

40:19.354 --> 40:22.346
I wish like hell I had minded
my own business.

40:22.391 --> 40:24.723
What did this man look like?

40:24.760 --> 40:26.318
Uh...

40:27.195 --> 40:30.995
He had a shaved head... and a moustache.

40:42.544 --> 40:46.139
I'm not gonna take you to Fukuda,
not just so you can kill him,

40:46.181 --> 40:50.515
any more than I was gonna be your shaikaku
or whatever you call it.

40:57.426 --> 40:58.916
Tozan.

41:00.962 --> 41:02.429
Tozan!

41:04.299 --> 41:05.789
Tozan!

41:08.637 --> 41:10.104
Ahh.

41:17.779 --> 41:23.115
Look, I can understand how this would
get to you. I don't like being lied to either.

41:23.151 --> 41:27.315
I am not angry. In a samurai,
anger is a wasted emotion.

41:27.356 --> 41:32.020
As one who hates waste, you can
appreciate that. I do what must be done.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.654
What about the arrow that is not aimed?

41:34.696 --> 41:39.133
At time of rest call for rest.
At time of action call for action.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.226
Come off it, Tozan!

41:41.269 --> 41:44.534
Avenging one's honor
is just revenge under another name.

41:44.573 --> 41:49.033
- If you ask me, revenge is more honest.
- To you, perhaps.

41:49.077 --> 41:52.877
Isn't recovering the plate what's important?
Isn't that your charge?

41:52.914 --> 41:57.476
If you kill Fukuda but lose the plate,
haven't you still lost your honor?

42:04.426 --> 42:07.759
Thank you, kaishaku,
for reminding me of my duty.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.151
Hello, Mr. Fukuda.

42:37.559 --> 42:41.893
You have something that belongs to Robin
Masters. We're here to return it to him.

42:41.930 --> 42:45.422
I don't have anything
that belongs to Mr. Masters,

42:45.467 --> 42:48.834
- just cheap souvenirs of my trip to Hawaii.
- You lie.

42:57.212 --> 42:59.203
- Tozan...?
- Sit down, quick!

42:59.247 --> 43:01.078
- What?
- Down!

44:01.009 --> 44:06.037
You know, Mr. Fukuda,
one of these plates... is the real Kenzan.

44:06.081 --> 44:07.412
Which one is it?

44:07.449 --> 44:11.909
I paid $5 apiece for those...
and you can't prove otherwise.

44:11.953 --> 44:16.515
Unless you want to be charged
with kidnapping, assault and theft,

44:16.558 --> 44:18.389
I suggest you release me.

44:26.368 --> 44:27.858
What are you doing?

44:28.904 --> 44:31.805
I'm breaking cheap souvenirs...

44:33.642 --> 44:36.110
for which I'll gladly pay you $5 apiece.

45:01.369 --> 45:02.996
No!

45:03.038 --> 45:04.562
Not that one, please!

45:06.374 --> 45:11.368
Very good, Magnum-san.
No wall between thought and deed.

45:13.815 --> 45:15.180
Tozan, no!

45:22.457 --> 45:27.121
There's a haiku that says, "Though
I thought of you as a gallant warrior",

45:27.162 --> 45:32.691
"Did you gird your sword just to gather
watercress in the Kaniha rice fields?"

45:36.404 --> 45:42.104
Very good, Magnum-san, very good,
but why do you care so much for his life?

45:43.044 --> 45:44.739
I don't.

45:44.779 --> 45:46.212
I care for yours.

45:55.056 --> 45:58.219
You risked busting a plate
worth a half-million bucks?

45:58.259 --> 46:02.889
Pounds, T.C. That's over $800,000.

46:02.931 --> 46:05.331
That's even worse.

46:05.367 --> 46:08.700
- What else could I do?
- You could've called the police.

46:08.737 --> 46:11.205
Higgins, you told me not to, remember?

46:11.239 --> 46:14.834
Besides, as Tozan's kaishuka,
I had no choice.

46:14.876 --> 46:17.902
It's kaishaku. And everyone has a choice.

46:17.946 --> 46:20.938
It's what separates us
from the lower animals.

46:20.982 --> 46:22.506
On second thought...

46:26.688 --> 46:30.021
What are you doing, Higgie baby,
joining the samurai union?

46:30.058 --> 46:35.428
Tozan donated this to the estate collection
as an apology for having lost the plate.

46:35.463 --> 46:39.627
- Mr. Masters was pleased when I told him.
- You told Robin what happened?

46:39.668 --> 46:43.160
Of course. He was grateful to Tozan
for recovering the plate.

46:43.905 --> 46:46.237
Did you tell him my contribution?

46:46.274 --> 46:50.677
No, but neither did I mention
your flagrant violation of estate rule.

46:51.746 --> 46:55.204
What did you do, T. M.,
put bubble bath in the tidal pool?

46:59.621 --> 47:01.418
This is the last can in the club.

47:01.456 --> 47:02.889
Hi, Higgins.

47:04.959 --> 47:08.292
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes, it's air freshener.

47:08.329 --> 47:12.265
- My locker smells like old gym shoes.
- You don't buy new ones!

47:12.300 --> 47:14.530
Only smell that would get rid of
is dog breath.

47:14.569 --> 47:17.265
- I knew it.
- No! I can explain!

47:17.305 --> 47:22.402
See, I've got this case. I gotta repossess
a car on Kaneohe and the guy's got dogs.

47:22.444 --> 47:26.039
Three dogs! You know what they say
about samurai swords -

47:26.081 --> 47:28.447
you unsheathe 'em, you gotta draw blood!

47:28.483 --> 47:29.973
I know!

47:30.018 --> 47:32.179
Yahh! Aiieeee...
