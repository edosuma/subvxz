00:01.627 --> 00:04.046
<i>[Peter]</i>
<i>Ever since I got my body back</i>
<i>from Doc Ock,</i>

00:04.046 --> 00:06.298
<i>it's been nonstop‐‐</i>
<i>defeating Venom,</i>

00:06.298 --> 00:09.635
<i>saving the Avengers,</i>
<i>taking down</i>
<i>the ultra‐powerful Regent...</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:11.762
<i>Spider‐Man</i>
<i>has been in rare form.</i>

00:11.762 --> 00:13.972
<i>But Peter Parker,</i>
<i>on the other hand‐‐</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:16.767
<i>Let's just say Ock</i>
<i>did some serious damage</i>
<i>to my personal life</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:18.769
<i>when he was pretending</i>
<i>to be me.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:21.146
<i>Most of my friends won't speak</i>
<i>to me and, even worse,</i>

00:21.146 --> 00:23.315
<i>Ock, as me,</i>
<i>quit Horizon High</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:25.943
<i>and seriously offended</i>
<i>the school's founder,</i>
<i>Max Modell,</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:28.153
<i>who now won't even</i>
<i>take my calls.</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:33.116
<i>So, first thing</i>
<i>on the "Getting My Life</i>
<i>Back on Track" checklist:</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:36.161
<i>convince Max to let me</i>
<i>reenroll at Horizon High.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:40.541
<i>And there he is.</i>
<i>Same train, every day,</i>
<i>like clockwork.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:44.503
<i>Now I just have to</i>
<i>accidentally bump into him,</i>
<i>and‐‐</i>

00:44.503 --> 00:46.755
[man]
Coming through!
[Peter]
Hey! Oh, come on! Really?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.096
I got this.
I got this.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.015
[pants]
Funny running into you,
huh? Max?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.517
Max?

00:58.517 --> 01:02.062
[pants]
He must have not heard me.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.277
Max!
What a coincidence.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.903
And look.
Huh?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.530
I accidentally
bought two drinks.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.490
Stop following me.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.660
Wha‐‐ This is
a total accident.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.038
The things you said
to me, Peter,
were deeply offensive.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.041
You have no idea
how sorry I am.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.002
No, no.
Sorry's not good enough.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.255
Given everything you've done,
not to mention
your tuition problems,

01:28.255 --> 01:30.674
you're not getting
back into Horizon.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.801
Give it up.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.678
<i>Sorry, Max,</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:38.890
<i>but giving up is not a skill</i>
<i>Peter Parker is any good at.</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:41.101
<i>I'm not dropping anything</i>
<i>from my checklist.</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:44.229
<i>Things like "Get people</i>
<i>to like Spider‐Man again."</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:46.481
<i>See how aggressive</i>
<i>he's become?</i>

01:46.481 --> 01:49.151
<i>This angry web‐spinner</i>
<i>is a hero!</i>

01:49.151 --> 01:53.155
<i>And get J. J. to hate</i>
<i>Spider‐Man again. Huh?</i>
[explosion]

01:53.155 --> 01:55.490
[sirens wailing]

01:55.490 --> 01:59.494
<i>Whoever that is might not be</i>
<i>on Peter Parker's checklist,</i>

01:59.494 --> 02:02.372
<i>but he just shot</i>
<i>straight to the top</i>
<i>of Spiderman's.</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:06.126
Hey, buddy,
you got a permit to turn
New York into a skating rink?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.213
[grunts]
Webs didn't stick!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.341
That's, like,
75% of their job!

02:12.341 --> 02:15.510
Frictionless suit.
Nothing can touch me.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.846
Can't say the same
about you.
[grunts]

02:17.846 --> 02:18.847
Huh? Aah!

02:35.197 --> 02:37.783
[groans]
So what's your deal,
Slippy Pants?

02:37.783 --> 02:39.326
Bank robbery?
Jewel heist?

02:39.326 --> 02:41.578
World domination?
All of the above?

02:41.578 --> 02:44.831
I only believe
that what goes around
comes around.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.669
And this city is gonna
rightfully pay for what it did
to Slyde.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.796
Wait.
So this is revenge?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.798
Look, if you've got
a nefarious scheme,

02:52.798 --> 02:55.217
at least have the courtesy
to explain it!

02:55.217 --> 02:57.219
You must be
really new at this.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.347
[grunts]

03:00.347 --> 03:04.476
I'd worry less about me
and more about them.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.895
[bystanders exclaiming]

03:08.188 --> 03:10.774
Not cool. Figuratively.
Literally.
[creaking]

03:10.774 --> 03:12.609
[fire escape crashes to ground]
Whatever‐ly.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.820
No sign of Slyde anywhere.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.572
Wait.
Beemont Chemical?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.741
And Allan Beemont himself?

03:19.741 --> 03:23.120
Uh, he's a brilliant innovator,
but I read he almost never
leaves his lab.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.913
What's going on here?

03:24.913 --> 03:27.958
And does it have
anything to do with that clown?

03:27.958 --> 03:30.919
Slippery little dude.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.921
Yes! Awesome!

03:32.921 --> 03:35.340
[chuckles]
What are you watching, Flash?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.551
<i>...acting like</i>
<i>a reckless idiot,</i>

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
<i>endangering lives!</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:41.888
<i>I thought he'd changed,</i>
<i>but maybe Spider‐Man's</i>

03:41.888 --> 03:43.557
<i>returning to his old ways!</i>

03:43.557 --> 03:46.977
J.J. hates Spidey again?
Nice.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.062
What?
[scoffs]
Nah, not that.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.858
This! Spidey's back
in his classic
red and blue costume,

03:52.858 --> 03:54.734
not that weird
red and black one.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.613
<i>And on top of everything else,</i>
<i>he's a miserable failure!</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:00.907
Maybe Jamison's right.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.326
Spidey got his butt kicked
by some newbie.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.079
I mean, it's great
that he seems less aggro,
but‐‐

04:06.079 --> 04:09.708
Pfft. I don't know.
Maybe he's lost his edge.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.378
Peter, got a minute?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.672
Everything okay,
Anna‐Maria?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.466
It's Otto.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.468
I haven't seen or heard
from him in days,

04:19.468 --> 04:21.470
not since we helped you
fight the Regent.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.638
Has he been
in touch with you?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.223
No.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.517
And given the mess
he made of my life,

04:27.517 --> 04:29.603
it's probably good
we don't run into each other.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.939
Peter, I know Otto
regrets everything
he put you through.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.858
And he did
the right thing in the end.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.278
But I'm the one stuck
trying to fix
all the damage he caused.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.071
I'm sure Ock's fine.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.865
I wouldn't worry
about him.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.910
Mr. Parker?
Your project?

04:45.952 --> 04:48.121
Uh, p‐‐ p‐project?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.123
Your term project.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.042
You do have it,
correct?

04:52.042 --> 04:54.836
[sighs]
And your excuse?

04:54.836 --> 04:58.215
<i>My mind wasn't in my body</i>
<i>when the assignment</i>
<i>was given out.</i>

04:58.215 --> 05:01.760
I, uh, left it at home,
Mr. Salerno.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.762
I'll bring it tomorrow?

05:03.762 --> 05:06.056
It was due today.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.809
That's ten percent
off your grade.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.020
[Peter]
Max won't let me into Horizon.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.272
Midtown's a total disaster.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.233
My best friend Harry's
still in Europe.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.985
Gwen and Anya
pretty much hate me.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.196
It's like the world I built
is completely gone,

05:21.196 --> 05:23.281
and I don't know
what to do, Uncle Ben.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.034
I had no control of my life
when Ock was me,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.495
but now that I'm back,
I still have no control.

05:28.495 --> 05:33.083
And there's no one I can talk to
who could possibly understand
how this feels.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.585
[clears throat]
Parker.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.587
[scoffs]
What are you doing here?

05:37.587 --> 05:40.799
Same as you,
I suppose.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.677
Looking for some...
direction.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.470
From my Uncle Ben?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
I share your memories.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.183
So, in a strange way,
he's my uncle too.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.435
No, he's not.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.021
You stole him from me,
Otto.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.107
You stole my life.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.317
Now have the decency
to stay out of it.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.113
I have been trying
just that.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.991
But how can I deny
this man's influence?

06:05.991 --> 06:09.953
Ben Parker is now as much
a part of me as he is you.

06:09.953 --> 06:14.291
And you, above all others,
know what an inspiration
he could be.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.546
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.924
No matter what kind of trouble
I got myself into,

06:22.924 --> 06:26.386
no matter how lost I was,
Uncle Ben always knew
how to lift me up.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.388
[device beeps]
Huh?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.683
Hmm? Slyde has
been sighted again.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.978
How do you know that?
And how do you know his name?

06:34.978 --> 06:39.399
My spider‐bots are still keeping
an eye all over the city.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.443
I saw your last interaction.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.863
Slyde is now moving
through Central Park.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.991
What are you waiting for?
Go stop him.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.201
You're Spider‐Man,
aren't you?

06:50.201 --> 06:54.039
And you, at least,
have a purpose.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.458
Otto, I...

06:57.626 --> 07:00.045
I've gotta go.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.213
[bystanders clamoring]

07:04.424 --> 07:06.593
[Spider‐Man]
This is your brilliant
revenge scheme?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.595
Blowing up a statue?
What's next?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.096
Seesaw? Roundabout?

07:10.096 --> 07:13.683
What's next is New York pays
for what was done to me.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.894
It's time to spread fear.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.731
No one is safe!

07:19.731 --> 07:21.900
Maybe if I can
accelerate my velocity

07:21.900 --> 07:24.277
and focus
the impact points‐‐
[yells]

07:24.277 --> 07:25.904
[grunts, groans]

07:25.904 --> 07:27.781
How can you stop me

07:27.781 --> 07:29.908
when you can't even
stop yourself?

07:29.908 --> 07:32.160
He's made me frictionless,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.121
but he didn't count
on my webs.
[web‐shooter deploying sounds]

07:35.121 --> 07:37.123
His chemicals jammed them?

07:37.123 --> 07:42.212
Guess I can't count
on my webs either! Whoa!
[horn blaring]

07:43.213 --> 07:45.090
Whoa!
[horn blaring]

07:46.424 --> 07:47.425
Aaah! Aah!

07:49.094 --> 07:52.430
Whoa! And the award
for Most Annoying Power

07:52.430 --> 07:55.016
goes to... Slyde,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.688
Also, never forget
the web‐wings, kids.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.065
I bet this is surprising!

08:02.065 --> 08:04.442
[grunts]
How am I not rid of you?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.486
Is that
a rhetorical question?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.239
It's gotta be,
'cause I don't think
you really want to hear

08:09.239 --> 08:11.282
about my adventures
as a human bobsled.
[horn blaring]

08:13.076 --> 08:14.285
[grunts]

08:14.285 --> 08:16.454
Whoa!
Aah!

08:17.831 --> 08:19.040
[grunts]

08:19.040 --> 08:21.584

Enough of this!

Hey! Huh?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.631
[yells]

08:26.631 --> 08:28.216
Aah!

08:28.216 --> 08:33.221
[grunts]
Spider‐Man, bitten
by a radioactive spider

08:33.221 --> 08:36.808
and given the power
to take humiliation
to a whole new level.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.229
<i>[J. Jonah Jameson]</i>
<i>Spider‐Man fails yet again!</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:43.648
<i>Has he lost whatever mojo</i>
<i>he found?</i>

08:43.648 --> 08:47.485
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>I wanna know</i>
<i>who this sliding guy is</i>

08:47.485 --> 08:50.321
<i>that's causing New Yorkers</i>
<i>to live in fear!</i>

08:50.321 --> 08:52.323
You and me both, J. J.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.701
[sighs]
But without my lab at Horizon,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.203
I don't have any of the tech
to run a proper analysis

08:57.203 --> 08:59.039
and produce a counter‐chemical.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.332
Ugh. Ock,

09:01.332 --> 09:04.085
why did you have to mess
everything up so badly?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.129
Wait. That's it!

09:08.548 --> 09:12.302
Hey, uh‐‐ Oh, whoa!

09:12.302 --> 09:14.596
This place is amazing.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.682
Was this your
headquarters when‐‐
When I was you?

09:17.682 --> 09:21.227
Yes. The Spider's Nest,
as I called it.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.354
Proved to be
a vital central lab.

09:23.354 --> 09:28.151
But now this is all...
irrelevant, isn't it?

09:28.151 --> 09:31.237
If it's so irrelevant,
why are you still here?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.239
I have nowhere else
to go, Parker.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.868
The world that I had built
is completely gone.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.829
Yeah. I know the feeling.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.166
Please do not waste
my time any further.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.710
Inform me of why you called.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.589
Slyde. I need your help
developing a counter
to his chemical powers.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.634
First you demand
that I stay out of your life,

09:52.634 --> 09:54.636
and now you come asking
for my assistance?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.846
Yes.
[stammers]

09:56.846 --> 10:00.850
I realized we could
maybe make a good team.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.437
I couldn't have defeated
the Regent in the Cellar
without your help.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.439
I need it again.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.650
I was once Spider‐Man.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.860
I will not be
Spider‐Man's sidekick.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.403
Okay.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.405
Guess it's my bad
for thinking

10:14.405 --> 10:17.784
there might still be a hero
left in you somewhere.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.454
Parker, hold it.

10:21.454 --> 10:26.167
As I said, Otto Octavius
is no one's sidekick.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.420
But the science behind
Slyde's power‐set intrigues me,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.464
and it would surely
expand the parameters

10:31.464 --> 10:33.633
of my knowledge
if I could understand it.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.595
I don't have the right lab gear
to fully process it at home,

10:37.595 --> 10:41.683
but I managed to derive this
from the chemicals
Slyde sprayed on my costume,

10:41.683 --> 10:44.477
which was kind of
totally humiliating.
[device clicks]

10:44.477 --> 10:46.813
Yes, I also found
that being a hero

10:46.813 --> 10:50.233
was not as glamorous
or respectable
as I had imagined.

10:50.233 --> 10:54.154
Yet it was still
strangely worth it.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.283
[clears throat]
I recognize several
of these chemical components.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.743
There are only
three companies that make them‐‐

11:00.743 --> 11:02.996
one in Frankfurt,
one in London,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.331
and one here in Manhattan.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.127
Is the one in Manhattan
the Beemont Chemical
Corporation, by chance?

11:09.127 --> 11:11.212
Allan Beemont is brilliant.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.382
I would not be surprised
if he was the source
of these chemicals?

11:14.382 --> 11:17.343
Then Spider‐Man
has to get to work.
Thanks, Ock.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.138
You... are welcome.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.765
But do not expect my help
to become routine.

11:22.765 --> 11:27.187
I know you're trying to resist
what Uncle Ben taught you, Otto.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.481
But you were right.
You can't.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.037
[rustling]
[gasps]

11:44.037 --> 11:46.206
How did you get in here?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.958
Spider‐Man?
Does whatever a spider can?

11:50.627 --> 11:53.254
Well, spider yourself
back out again.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.715
I'm not here
to make any trouble.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.259
Well, maybe a little.
It's kind of my thing.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.263
What's the connection
between your company
and that lunatic Slyde?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.515
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.477
Funny. I could have sworn
I saw you and your men

12:07.477 --> 12:09.145
at the scene
of Slyde's first attack.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.980
Those chemical explosions?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.524
Beemont Chem was there
to assist in the cleanup‐‐

12:13.524 --> 12:16.694
something we've done
many times over the years
to help law enforcement.

12:16.694 --> 12:21.324
Now get out before I have
my entire security force
up here.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.952
Whoa. No need for that.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.580
You seem a little aggravated
for someone who apparently
has never heard of Slyde.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.915
Out!

12:28.915 --> 12:31.334
Okay,
I can take a hint.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.503
[growls]

12:33.503 --> 12:37.507
I seem to have struck
a nerve with Beemont.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.760
He's hiding something.
But what?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.930
Maybe a quick look
in his lab, and‐‐
[man] Spider‐Man.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.935
We don't have much time.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.105
Please, listen to me.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.607
Sure thing, Mr.‐‐
Doctor.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.111
Dr. Joseph Rockwell,
Chief Technical Officer
at Beemont.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.113
He's afraid
you'll discover the truth.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.616
Look, I've given my life
to this company,

13:03.616 --> 13:07.453
but safety and justice
are more important
than a corporation.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.707
So, there is a connection
between Beemont and Slyde?

13:10.707 --> 13:14.168
Yes. His name
is Jalome Beacher.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.422
Former employee.
One of our most
brilliant researchers.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.507
Then what went wrong?

13:19.507 --> 13:21.301
<i>[Dr. Rockwell]</i>
<i>Beemont's ego.</i>

13:21.301 --> 13:23.386
<i>You see, a good part</i>
<i>of his global reputation</i>

13:23.386 --> 13:25.388
<i>has been built on</i>
<i>other people's work.</i>

13:25.388 --> 13:27.974
<i>He wanted credit</i>
<i>for what Beacher developed.</i>

13:27.974 --> 13:30.643
<i>When Beacher objected,</i>
<i>Allan had him fired.</i>

13:30.643 --> 13:33.855
So that crazy suit,
the slip‐sliding chemicals,

13:33.855 --> 13:36.691
the thermite bombs‐‐
all developed here?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.234
Mm‐hmm.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.486
Why the rampage?
I don't get it.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.697
Imagine what will happen
if the world learns

13:42.697 --> 13:44.490
the maniac
attacking New York

13:44.490 --> 13:46.826
created his tech
here at Beemont?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.078
Tech that Beemont
has full credit for.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.831
That's a scandal you might
not be able to recover from.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.750
Slyde wants
to ruin this company,

13:53.750 --> 13:57.503
so Beemont has been trying
to cover any connection
to him and Beacher‐‐

13:57.503 --> 14:00.548
erasing e‐mails,
corporate records...

14:00.548 --> 14:04.719
He fears if and when
Beacher is captured,
it will ruin him.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.929
Beacher might have been
ripped off by Allan Beemont,

14:06.929 --> 14:11.434
but as Slyde, he's putting
people's lives at risk.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.812
That's a formula I developed
that could counteract
his powers.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.816
Slyde needs to be stopped,
even if it might destroy
this company.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.068
[explosion]
[both exclaim]

14:22.820 --> 14:25.656
That sounds
like Slyde again.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.617
Only you can save New York,
Spider‐Man.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.660
[web‐shooter deploys]

14:32.371 --> 14:34.791

[both whimpering]

14:39.003 --> 14:40.797
You're welcome!
Beacher!

14:40.797 --> 14:44.175
You know who I am?
Good.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.594
Soon everyone
will know the truth,

14:46.594 --> 14:49.222
and Beemont will pay
for what he did to me

14:49.222 --> 14:53.226
and all the others whose work
he claimed as his own!
[grunts]

14:53.226 --> 14:56.938
You're attacking the city
like this so everyone
will blame Beemont Chemicals?

14:56.938 --> 14:59.524
Isn't this a tiny bit
of an overreaction?

14:59.524 --> 15:01.150
It was just a job!

15:01.150 --> 15:03.194
It was my life!

15:03.194 --> 15:05.488
I know Beemont's
trying to keep
our connection hidden,

15:05.488 --> 15:07.740
but he won't be able
to ignore this.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.784
A video game controller?

15:09.784 --> 15:11.786
Color me... unimpressed.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.622
It's time for New York
to fall.
[beeps]

15:16.582 --> 15:19.544
Okay, now can we say
this is an overreaction?

15:26.843 --> 15:30.096

Didn't Beemont Chemicals have
a work complaints department?

[grunting]

15:31.514 --> 15:32.723

15:43.109 --> 15:44.902

15:49.991 --> 15:52.493
That should do the trick.
Barely.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.246
What?
How can I stop all this?

16:08.217 --> 16:11.262
‐ [bystanders cheering]
‐ Spider‐bots?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.264
<i>[Dr. Octavius]</i>
<i>I will control</i>
<i>the fires, Spider‐Man.</i>

16:13.264 --> 16:14.932
You need to focus on Slyde.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.561

get more dangerous.

<i>[Spider‐Man]</i>
<i>Ock? I thought you were done</i>

16:21.939 --> 16:23.941
Your points were valid,

16:23.941 --> 16:27.820
I could not turn my back
on Uncle Ben's teachings
if I tried.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.200
However, I am your equal, not‐‐
<i>My sidekick. Got it.</i>

16:32.200 --> 16:34.827
And totally cool with it.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.914
<i>I'm sending you a formula</i>
<i>that's supposed to counter</i>
<i>Slyde's powers.</i>

<i>Can you turn this</i>
<i>into a serum?</i>
Hmm?

16:40.541 --> 16:43.878
This formula is rudimentary,
but with some tweaks,

16:43.878 --> 16:46.589
I can make it more effective.
[sirens wailing]

16:46.589 --> 16:48.758
[sighs]
No sign of Slyde anywhere.
[horn blares]

16:48.758 --> 16:51.886
<i>My spider‐bots can see</i>
<i>that he is heading</i>
<i>to Beemont Chemical,</i>

16:51.886 --> 16:54.055
which is not surprising
in the least.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.391
<i>You expected Slyde</i>
<i>to face Allan Beemont head‐on?</i>

16:57.391 --> 17:00.937
No. This situation
is more complicated than that.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.815
Based on
security footage I accessed
before I sent in the bots,

17:04.815 --> 17:08.653
Slyde has returned
to Beemont Chemical
after every one of his rampages.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.532
Why would Slyde do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.410
Only because you are thinking
like a hero, Spider‐Man.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.121
If one were to think
like a villain,

17:19.121 --> 17:22.166
which I might have
some experience with,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.794
there are a number of reasons
to hide in plain sight.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.129
Ock, that's genius!

17:27.129 --> 17:29.882
I need you to research
one more thing for me.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.765
So this is
your secret Slyde‐out.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.935
[chuckles]
Get it? I can come up
with names like that all day.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.812
[growls]

17:44.689 --> 17:47.775
Aah!

17:47.775 --> 17:50.152
Rough crowd.
You're ruining my plans,

[grunting]

17:57.285 --> 17:58.869

There's been a lot
of friction between us

18:05.626 --> 18:08.879

Jalome Beacher
defeating Spider‐Man.

<i>[Dr. Octavius] There is</i>

My chemicals...

18:29.400 --> 18:31.944
You rendered them inert?
Impossible!

"Impossible" is our specialty.

What's Slyde doing here?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.920
Spare me the act
of surprise, Beemont.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.174
I know you kept
this city in danger
to protect yourself.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.885
But you're not the one
I'm really after.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.972
Dr. Rockwell.
Waiting to see the results
of all your plans?

18:59.972 --> 19:03.768
What are you talking about,
Spider‐Man?
I helped you stop Slyde.

19:03.768 --> 19:08.105
Exactly.
So you could take over
Beemont Chemical for yourself.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.399
What? Is this true?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.401
I was surprised, too,

19:12.401 --> 19:15.237
until I was reminded
to think like a villain.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.657
I had a friend look you up,
Rockwell.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.701
Wasn't easy, but he accessed
encrypted security footage

19:20.701 --> 19:23.496
of you giving Beacher
the chemicals he needed.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.040
[growling]
You wanted
this company to fail.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.168
<i>So Allan Beemont</i>
<i>would be fired,</i>
<i>stocks would plummet,</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:31.420
<i>and a group of rather</i>
<i>mysterious investors</i>

<i>would buy Beemont Chemical,</i>
<i>put you in charge,</i>

19:33.923 --> 19:36.050
<i>and take complete control</i>
<i>of this place.</i>

19:36.050 --> 19:39.929
This is the part where you say,
"And I would've gotten
away with it too!"

19:39.929 --> 19:42.431
You're the one who convinced me
Beacher should be fired

19:42.431 --> 19:45.267
for accusing me
of stealing his ideas,
which wasn't true.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.020
You and I were friends.
Why would you do all this?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.064
Friends?

19:50.064 --> 19:53.234
I owe loyalty to no one‐‐

19:53.234 --> 19:56.654
only to the Goblin Nation!

19:59.782 --> 20:01.575

revealed myself to you,

So, Otto called me, and we're
going to meet for lunch.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.076
I talked to him.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.996
He's been feeling
a little lost.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.290
But I think
he's getting better now.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.042

Would Midtown be interested

20:52.042 --> 20:54.170
in hiring
a brilliant new teacher?

20:54.170 --> 20:58.090
You know what?
It just might be.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.181
I see you've got
your Spider‐geek
back on pretty huge.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.184
Did you see the way
he took down that Slyde guy?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.060
[laughs]
It was epic!

21:10.060 --> 21:12.062
I'm not gonna argue that.
