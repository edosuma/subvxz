00:28.571 --> 00:32.009
'Health is the greatest
of God's gifts.

00:32.009 --> 00:34.089
'But we take it for granted.

00:34.090 --> 00:37.969
'It hangs on a thread
as fine as a spider's web.

00:37.970 --> 00:40.649
'And the smallest thing can make it
snap,

00:40.650 --> 00:44.009
'leaving the strongest of us
helpless in an instant.

00:44.508 --> 00:49.358
'And in that instant,
hope is our protector,

00:50.170 --> 00:52.770
'and love, our panacea.'

01:01.730 --> 01:03.770
What can I get you today?

01:08.090 --> 01:10.570
Hello, dear.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.730
WOMAN: Frank? Frank!

01:20.410 --> 01:22.769
Frank!

01:22.770 --> 01:25.289
I swear, you'd forget your head!

01:25.290 --> 01:27.529
Try and get something down you,
yeah? Right.

01:27.530 --> 01:31.050
Right, Tip, look after him.
All right, Peggy.

01:33.490 --> 01:38.410
If you want to be a fish man, Tip,
you've got to learn how to buy.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.169
I wouldn't give that to my dog! Oi!

01:43.170 --> 01:45.729
One and ninepence?
You're havin' a laugh!

01:45.730 --> 01:48.249
Go on! Have a pint of oysters.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.929
Looking fresh as a daisy, Elsie.
Unlike your fish.

01:51.930 --> 01:55.210
Oh, here's trouble.
Poison, pure poison!

01:56.570 --> 02:01.169
Disappointed again, Frank?
I wonder quite why you bother coming...

02:01.170 --> 02:03.890
every day.

02:06.610 --> 02:10.929
The early bird might catch the worm,
but he don't pay for it till later.

02:10.930 --> 02:14.209
Then he gets it half-price.

02:14.210 --> 02:17.969
Oh, that'll be lovely tonight.
There you go.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.050
Perfect.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.170
Morning, Peggy.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.409
Morning, Nurse Lee.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.769
Ooh, it's hotter than abroad
out there.

02:28.770 --> 02:32.489
Still, can't complain.
Flowers are loving it.

02:32.490 --> 02:34.809
I forgot to ask,
how's your brother, Frank?

02:34.810 --> 02:36.969
Much better, thanks, Miss,
he's on the salts.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.609
Still?!

02:38.610 --> 02:41.769
Well, oyster poisoning
can take an age, they say.

02:41.770 --> 02:44.889
I'm sure Dr Turner would be more
than happy to have a look at him.

02:44.890 --> 02:47.209
Oh, he's not one for sawbones, Miss.

02:47.210 --> 02:52.049
No, it's nothing home cooking
and a bit of spoiling won't cure.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.770
GRUNTING

02:59.970 --> 03:01.370
Catch it, Peg!

03:06.330 --> 03:10.409
I'm not even going to ask what you're
doing with a pig in the middle of Poplar!

03:10.410 --> 03:12.449
Bacon!

03:12.450 --> 03:14.329
It's the future!

03:14.330 --> 03:16.250
PIG SQUEALS

03:18.010 --> 03:23.049
Peggy, what's the matter?
The floor's all filthy again, Miss.

03:23.050 --> 03:26.649
Oh, don't worry about that!

03:26.650 --> 03:29.009
It's like dust.

03:29.010 --> 03:31.450
Leave it long enough
and you stop noticing.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.649
CAR HORN BEEPS

03:48.650 --> 03:50.330
Fancy a lift?!

03:52.890 --> 03:55.609
I think it would be safer to walk!

03:55.610 --> 03:57.889
What on earth are you doing
with that old heap?!

03:57.890 --> 04:01.049
Shh! She's terribly sensitive! She?!

04:01.050 --> 04:04.249
I'll forgive you, but only because
I know you'll grow to love her.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.689
Will I?

04:05.690 --> 04:09.690
I expect you to fall more in love
with every drive.

04:24.490 --> 04:27.170
Go on. Be off with yous.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.329
SHE MUTTERS

04:37.330 --> 04:38.809
Dabs and sprats.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.609
Nonnatus daily special.

04:40.610 --> 04:41.929
Only the best!

04:41.930 --> 04:44.774
SHE MUTTERS: I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry. I tried!

04:44.775 --> 04:46.729
Peg?

04:46.730 --> 04:50.249
Peg, what's up, girl? I'm sorry.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.570
The workhouse is long gone for us.

04:53.770 --> 04:56.689
There's only people here
who care about you, Peg.

04:56.690 --> 04:59.569
About the both of us.

04:59.570 --> 05:03.769
So, I finished my rounds and I thought
we could walk home along the river.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.689
Get the breeze.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.289
Really?

05:07.290 --> 05:09.249
Already?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.290
Free as a bird.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.329
Morning, ladies! Are we well?

05:18.330 --> 05:19.769
ALL: Morning, Doctor.

05:19.770 --> 05:22.609
It's a bit like a piano scale...

05:22.610 --> 05:24.530
CHILDREN SHOUT AND LAUGH

05:25.490 --> 05:29.009
... with little Bertie there.
The result of the crescendo.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.009
I haven't thought of it
quite like that,

05:31.010 --> 05:34.649
but keep it in mind at
next week's contraceptive session.

05:34.650 --> 05:38.169
A few less crescendos?
A few less results.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.129
I just feel we should make them
aware that they have a choice.

05:41.130 --> 05:43.730
And that God's place is in
the church, not the marital bed.

05:46.650 --> 05:50.289
Look, it's a bit much for me
to say where our Lord should be.

05:50.290 --> 05:53.169
I'm not expecting you to start
a revolution, Nurse Browne.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.290
But if you did,
I wouldn't hold it against you.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.690
Can't catch me, I'm the fastest!
Yes, I can!

06:07.250 --> 06:10.449
Elsie, you really must try
and keep these appointments.

06:10.450 --> 06:14.649
That's three in a row you've missed.
Tide don't wait for man nor baby.

06:14.650 --> 06:18.609
While there's fish to catch,
me and me old man will catch 'em.

06:18.610 --> 06:20.489
Sorry, girls.

06:20.490 --> 06:25.170
Eels. They do tend to linger
somewhat.

06:26.210 --> 06:29.769
Oh! They certainly do. Sorry.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.209
Always had this thing about fish.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.609
Ever since my brother dropped me
in a rock pool.

06:34.610 --> 06:37.009
Good job my old man don't.

06:37.010 --> 06:40.689
It's like garlic. As long as you're
both on it, you don't notice.

06:40.690 --> 06:44.969
Let's hope that baby likes it too, because
he or she is most certainly not far off.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.450
You need to rest, Elsie.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.449
I don't want that filthy thing
anywhere near me!

06:53.450 --> 06:56.809
Well, you needn't worry, she's
very particular about her company.

06:56.810 --> 06:59.369
What a team we're going to make, eh?

06:59.370 --> 07:03.249
Your beauty and my brains
and the price of bacon sky-high!

07:03.250 --> 07:06.929
Oh, you know, bacon isn't popped out
like an egg, Fred.

07:06.930 --> 07:10.569
This IS the bacon,
so don't be getting sentimental now.

07:10.570 --> 07:13.009
Me?! Strictly business
and no mistake!

07:13.010 --> 07:16.409
Well, there's no mistake about one
thing. You've got a lot more pig

07:16.410 --> 07:18.689
than you bargained for!
She's pregnant.

07:18.690 --> 07:22.689
Oh, give me strength, O Lord!
Not more of those things!

07:22.690 --> 07:25.489
Oh! Cloth, Frederick, now!

07:25.490 --> 07:29.249
Dogs look up to us,
cats look down on us.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.770
Pigs treat us as equals!

07:44.930 --> 07:46.450
Oh.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.369
I should get on.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.689
That oven's crying out for a clean.

07:52.690 --> 07:56.089
And here's me lying back
like Gloria Swanson all afternoon!

07:56.090 --> 07:58.529
We're on our holidays, Peg,
just for the day.

07:58.530 --> 08:00.369
Think of this as Paris.

08:00.370 --> 08:05.130
And that river over there,
well, that's the Seine, ain't it?

08:06.850 --> 08:11.129
How is it you always know
just how to make everything better?

08:11.130 --> 08:13.289
To Frank.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.169
Nicest fellow I know!

08:15.170 --> 08:17.450
And the one with the biggest head.

08:18.970 --> 08:22.490
I've known you longer
than anyone else in the world.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.130
Maybe that's got something
to do with it.

08:33.370 --> 08:36.450
It's the sitting down.
Don't suit you.

08:37.610 --> 08:39.289
I need to get those vines in.

08:44.130 --> 08:47.729
We shall have our own wine
next year, Peggy, my dear.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.210
That's a promise now?

08:51.770 --> 08:53.370
HE GRUNTS

08:56.610 --> 08:57.889
Frank?

08:57.890 --> 08:59.610
Frank?

09:01.090 --> 09:02.130
Frank!

09:12.570 --> 09:14.450
Sorry, it's an emergency!

09:17.930 --> 09:20.369
'Nonnatus House,
Sister Bernadette speaking.'

09:20.370 --> 09:22.729
It's my Frank! He's took bad!

09:22.730 --> 09:25.637
Please, Sister, please come quick!

09:27.410 --> 09:30.689
Dr Turner is making arrangements
for Frank to be seen at the London.

09:30.690 --> 09:34.570
You do understand, Peggy, Frank
must be seen as soon as possible?

09:36.570 --> 09:38.049
Thank you.

09:38.050 --> 09:41.169
I won't go in no institution.

09:41.170 --> 09:44.009
It's a hospital. Not a mortuary!

09:44.010 --> 09:45.970
You'll have to drag me there.

09:47.930 --> 09:50.569
Work your magic, please, Peggy.

09:50.570 --> 09:55.009
If there's a choice, I'd rather not
drag him there, but if needs must.

09:55.010 --> 09:58.809
There's nothing wrong with a bit of
gut pain, it's nothing wrong with me!

09:58.810 --> 10:01.409
I'm telling you! Good.

10:01.410 --> 10:04.689
Then we won't have to worry
about the results, will we,

10:04.690 --> 10:07.090
when you go in?

10:09.050 --> 10:13.449
Dr Turner has asked me to take the
contraceptive clinic. But nobody's here.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.529
We must have got in a muddle
over our days.

10:15.530 --> 10:18.729
Never mind. No point
in carrying coals to Newcastle!

10:18.730 --> 10:21.689
I suppose onward
with the antenatal!

10:21.690 --> 10:25.250
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

10:37.770 --> 10:41.849
The Yanks reckon they got a pill
stops you getting in the family way.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.249
That's Hollywood for you.
Full of happy endings.

10:46.250 --> 10:49.769
Give us a pill that makes fellas
do the washing up!

10:49.770 --> 10:51.729
Or something useful like drowning!

10:51.730 --> 10:54.569
I hope they're not expecting
juggling. No balls, you see.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.649
Metaphorically, of course!

10:56.650 --> 11:00.409
Chummy, let me take the session.
No, wouldn't dream of it.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.490
Dr Turner's tasked me for a reason.

11:08.050 --> 11:10.610
And they say there's no such thing
as average.

11:14.010 --> 11:15.649
Good morning, ladies.

11:15.650 --> 11:18.529
My old man wouldn't know
whether to smoke it, eat it

11:18.530 --> 11:21.610
or shine his shoes with it!
LAUGHTER

11:23.090 --> 11:25.449
Today is about understanding
your prophylactic.

11:25.450 --> 11:29.249
Do you mean johnnies?!
LAUGHTER

11:29.250 --> 11:33.050
Prophy... what?!
Didn't know we was learning Latin!

11:34.330 --> 11:37.569
There's me thinking
you'd be making ME money!

11:37.570 --> 11:40.649
I'll be spending more on feed
than I'll be making!

11:40.650 --> 11:42.530
Here. Here!

11:44.450 --> 11:47.250
Only the best for you, girl.
Don't let on, eh!

11:57.130 --> 11:59.849
If it helps you to get your husband
to wear one

11:59.850 --> 12:03.689
and reduce the number of unexpected
little miracles then johnnies it is.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.089
Have you even seen one, lovey?

12:06.090 --> 12:09.690
Maybe I should go over there.

12:10.690 --> 12:14.129
I have seen... I have seen
many things, Mrs Leonard!

12:14.130 --> 12:18.769
I have seen the horrors of eclampsia
with convulsions so violent, bones broke.

12:18.770 --> 12:20.489
Standing on the toes, was you?!

12:20.490 --> 12:23.489
Button it! Let her talk!

12:23.490 --> 12:25.770
Aww!

12:26.770 --> 12:30.889
I have seen breech births where
one wrong move, one moment's delay,

12:30.890 --> 12:33.569
would cut off baby's oxygen.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.129
I have drawn mucus
from the lungs of newborns

12:36.130 --> 12:38.890
who would otherwise
have choked to death.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.530
And I have seen the utter joy
that only childbirth can bring.

12:45.970 --> 12:48.769
So, please. Please don't doubt

12:48.770 --> 12:53.089
that I have seen enough to have earned
the right to speak to you today.

12:53.090 --> 12:56.649
I'm just saying, it goes against God.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.889
It's stopping what's natural.

12:58.890 --> 13:02.329
If God hadn't wanted their use,
he wouldn't have created rubber.

13:02.330 --> 13:05.250
It too is entirely natural.

13:07.290 --> 13:11.809
Now... taking your penis,
or rather your husband's...!

13:11.810 --> 13:14.290
LAUGHTER

13:15.290 --> 13:17.609
Of course, we wouldn't expect you
to maintain

13:17.610 --> 13:21.049
this level of audience whilst
experimenting with your prophylactic.

13:21.050 --> 13:25.169
The reservoir goes at the top. This
is where the semen will be held.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.849
Looks like a tiny sombrero, really!

13:27.850 --> 13:29.810
Ole!

14:04.050 --> 14:05.210
Constable.

14:11.530 --> 14:13.809
Camilla.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.129
Peter. How lovely.

14:16.130 --> 14:19.129
I was passing,
so I thought I'd drop in.

14:19.130 --> 14:22.049
There's been some thefts in the area.

14:22.050 --> 14:26.089
I thought you should be alert
with regard to security. Thefts?

14:26.090 --> 14:29.529
Well, a few shopkeepers
have had some losses.

14:29.530 --> 14:33.169
It looks like the work of a chancer,
but best be on guard.

14:33.170 --> 14:36.850
Tell the girls not to leave their
handbags and the like lying around.

14:42.370 --> 14:45.050
And my mother would very much
like you to come for tea.

14:46.690 --> 14:48.490
I should like that very much.

14:50.330 --> 14:53.049
I'll telephone you with a date.

14:53.050 --> 14:57.090
(And, um... I'd be very grateful
if you didn't bring that thing.)

15:01.290 --> 15:04.050
Oh! Quite!

15:11.130 --> 15:12.889
SHE SQUEALS

15:12.890 --> 15:15.809
RADIO: 'Go to the industrial towns.

15:15.810 --> 15:17.649
'Go to the farms.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.715
'And you will see a state
of prosperity

15:20.716 --> 15:24.049
such as we have never had
in my lifetime.

15:24.050 --> 15:29.609
'Or, indeed,
in the history of this country.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.911
'Indeed, let us be frank about it.

15:31.912 --> 15:36.650
Most of our people
have never had it so good.'

15:38.730 --> 15:41.529
Nurse Lee. Good morning. Is Peggy in?

15:41.530 --> 15:43.409
She's just inside.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.970
Are you in a terrible hurry?

15:56.010 --> 16:00.889
He feels terrible about bothering you
all. Everyone being so kind and concerned.

16:00.890 --> 16:03.729
Strong as an ox, my Frank.
Don't you worry about that.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.049
Peggy.

16:06.050 --> 16:09.410
Frank's suffering
cancer of the pancreas.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.609
Pancreas, you said?

16:14.610 --> 16:18.929
We'd like to begin
a series of radium treatments.

16:18.930 --> 16:22.489
Well, it's not like his stomach
or his liver, is it?

16:22.490 --> 16:24.170
More like an appendix.

16:25.330 --> 16:28.649
Well, you hear about people doing
without their appendix every day.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.129
Ain't that right, Nurse Lee?

16:31.130 --> 16:34.609
Dr Turner hopes the radium treatment
will stem the cancer.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.049
Hopes?

16:36.050 --> 16:39.370
The quicker we move on this,
the better your brother's chances.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.449
I'd like him to stay in the London
during the treatment.

16:44.450 --> 16:47.089
It just makes things easier
and better for Frank.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.769
No. He won't stay in there.
He don't like institutions.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.569
We'd have to carry him in,
feet first.

16:51.570 --> 16:55.569
You must try and persuade him, Peggy.
As an inpatient,

16:55.570 --> 16:58.529
Frank can be assured
the very best care.

16:58.530 --> 17:00.769
He will need it. I'm telling you.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.410
He won't stay anywhere,
except his home.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.810
PEGGY: You're doing it for me, Frank.
You've got no choice.

17:31.210 --> 17:34.850
Mr Hobson.
Would you like to come through?

17:48.050 --> 17:52.130
THEY SING HYMNS

17:58.290 --> 17:59.997
Life everlasting.

18:01.570 --> 18:04.049
PHONE RINGS

18:04.050 --> 18:06.329
Nonnatus House, Nurse Lee speaking.

18:06.330 --> 18:09.850
MAN: 'Jenny? Is that Jenny Lee?

18:11.770 --> 18:15.249
'I've tried not to call,
but I needed to hear your voice.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.250
'Jenny...'

18:19.130 --> 18:21.009
MATURE JENNY: 'His name was Gerald.

18:21.010 --> 18:24.049
'He said he wanted to hear my voice.

18:24.050 --> 18:26.489
'I did not want to hear his.

18:26.490 --> 18:30.010
'It stirred too many memories.
Too much pain.

18:31.010 --> 18:35.369
'His voice came from a place
of broken rules,

18:35.370 --> 18:39.049
'a time of love cut short.

18:39.050 --> 18:42.609
'It was easier to silence it.

18:42.610 --> 18:44.369
'Easier to hide.

18:44.370 --> 18:48.890
'To fill my life
with other people's stories.'

19:13.410 --> 19:17.529
Keep on with the cod.
We can't get rid of it fast enough.

19:17.530 --> 19:20.689
But from next month, don't be having
nothing to do with oysters.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.770
No matter how hard
old Billy tries to push 'em.

19:25.410 --> 19:27.330
You'll be back on the stall by then.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.770
That's right.

19:32.810 --> 19:35.729
Enjoy your moment, Tip.

19:35.730 --> 19:39.010
I'll have you back fetching
and carrying before you know it!

19:42.410 --> 19:46.530
Frank's dying, Peggy. Are you
quite sure he shouldn't know?

19:47.570 --> 19:49.969
Been through that ruddy treatment
for weeks.

19:49.970 --> 19:52.489
Body's done in.

19:52.490 --> 19:55.209
Cancer's still there.

19:55.210 --> 19:58.529
He can't know that, Sister.
It would destroy him quicker.

19:58.530 --> 20:03.369
Only thing that keeps him going
is the thought he's beating it.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.409
Frank's taken a turn.

20:05.410 --> 20:06.729
I don't know what to do.

20:06.730 --> 20:10.169
That's all right, Tip.
We'll look after him.

20:10.170 --> 20:12.769
You go on, love.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.410
Frank needs you on the stall.

20:24.370 --> 20:25.969
HE COUGHS

20:25.970 --> 20:27.929
Radium treatment is never pleasant,

20:27.930 --> 20:30.249
but we're going to help you
with the pain, Frank.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.729
Morphia? So soon?

20:32.730 --> 20:34.249
It's a very low dose, Peggy.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.770
But Dr Turner felt it was necessary.

20:44.490 --> 20:47.090
How long do you reckon
before I'm back?

20:51.890 --> 20:54.170
Not very long now, Frank.

21:31.810 --> 21:35.009
I'd have done that, love.

21:35.010 --> 21:37.770
It's quite all right, Peggy.
It's my job.

21:59.130 --> 22:02.649
I happened to see the rest
of the house today, Sister.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.450
Extraordinary, isn't it?

22:05.650 --> 22:07.649
It was a shock.

22:07.650 --> 22:11.850
Those prefabs are only ever expected
to last four or five years.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.850
I'm not talking about the prefab.

22:19.410 --> 22:21.369
They share a bed.

22:21.370 --> 22:25.089
Yet Peggy and Frank
wouldn't trade theirs for a palace,

22:25.090 --> 22:28.169
everything just as they need it
for their little bit of peace.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.370
And Lord knows,
they need it at the moment.

22:31.690 --> 22:33.130
You know, don't you?

22:34.890 --> 22:36.729
That Frank is dying?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.649
That his sister will lose him?

22:39.650 --> 22:42.690
Or that love couldn't save
either of them?

22:44.410 --> 22:46.890
But it has made them richer.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.649
CHUMMY: Every time I feel exhausted,

22:58.650 --> 23:02.289
I stop and imagine
what a sad little porker's feeling.

23:02.290 --> 23:07.169
Really, Chummy, you mustn't talk
about Sister Evangelina like that!

23:07.170 --> 23:08.969
So, go on, Jen.

23:08.970 --> 23:12.049
They're at it?
All I know is they share a bed.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.769
It's the quiet ones.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.489
What did Sister Julienne say?

23:16.490 --> 23:18.209
She didn't.

23:18.210 --> 23:21.769
She discussed the merits
of prefabricated housing.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.969
I wish my mother
was that unshockable.

23:23.970 --> 23:27.209
Well, I for one think
Peggy's a spiffing girl

23:27.210 --> 23:29.929
and Frank had some of the
finest dabs I've ever tasted.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.609
Darling, no-one's doubting him
on a marine level.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.730
Just a moral one. He's her brother!

23:35.850 --> 23:37.010
Oh!

23:39.890 --> 23:43.289
I imagine none of you girls
has ever been inside a workhouse.

23:43.290 --> 23:47.730
Actually, my grandpapa set up a holiday
fund for children of the workhouse.

23:49.730 --> 23:51.529
Fascinating, I'm sure.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.009
They were designed
to break the spirit.

23:54.010 --> 23:57.169
Worse than dying. That's what anyone
who'd been in one said.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.329
And Frank and Peggy
would tell you the same.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.009
They went in there
when they were just little 'uns.

24:02.010 --> 24:05.129
Mother and father dead,
no-one to look after them,

24:05.130 --> 24:08.889
but Frank, only seven,
he swore he could look after Peggy.

24:08.890 --> 24:13.009
He fought everyone
to keep them together,

24:13.010 --> 24:16.289
but the minute they went through
those gates, they were torn apart.

24:16.290 --> 24:20.449
Now, she cried every night, didn't
know how to survive without him,

24:20.450 --> 24:23.609
and Frank,
he never stopped looking for her.

24:23.610 --> 24:26.689
So when he finally found her
years later,

24:26.690 --> 24:29.689
it's not surprising
they clung together for dear life.

24:29.690 --> 24:33.369
Their love was the only good thing
that ever came out of that place.

24:33.370 --> 24:36.169
But, Sister, it's incest.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.009
SHE EXHALES

24:38.010 --> 24:42.489
There was nothing left of family, the
minute they walked through those gates.

24:42.490 --> 24:44.530
Now, if you've got no work to do...

24:49.970 --> 24:52.610
You go on,
I'd better check the phone.

25:03.650 --> 25:06.890
I'm hoping perhaps I may receive
a call of a personal nature.

25:09.370 --> 25:11.689
I'm meeting Peter's ma.

25:11.690 --> 25:13.489
Date of execution yet to be set.

25:13.490 --> 25:17.809
If Peter thinks enough of you to meet
his mother, I'm sure she'll love you too.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.049
One little thing has been
on the old mind a bit.

25:20.050 --> 25:22.489
What does one wear
in a mother-meeting situation?

25:22.490 --> 25:25.009
Nothing - not until you've checked
with us first.

25:25.010 --> 25:28.009
I do have rather a nice frock
Mother's dressmaker made for me.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.449
It would be a bit tight now, but...
Nothing!

25:30.450 --> 25:32.009
Not until we've approved it.

25:32.010 --> 25:33.490
CAR HORN BEEPS

25:41.090 --> 25:42.610
SHE LAUGHS

25:44.210 --> 25:45.929
It's absolutely wonderful!

25:45.930 --> 25:47.650
JIMMY: She!

25:48.930 --> 25:52.049
So, fancy getting out
of the East End for a bit?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.610
I know a lovely little place
in the country.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.689
Yes. Yes, I do.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.529
I told you you'd fall more in love
each time.

26:00.530 --> 26:02.049
Ladies.

26:02.050 --> 26:03.089
ALL: Hey!

26:03.090 --> 26:05.250
Oh, hello! Hello!

26:06.490 --> 26:08.769
No, no, you're with me, I'm afraid.

26:08.770 --> 26:10.569
Chauffeur's perk.

26:10.570 --> 26:13.929
♪ We'll be in heaven if you meet

26:13.930 --> 26:18.810
♪ Me on the corner tonight... ♪

26:30.850 --> 26:32.770
You look worn out.

26:34.650 --> 26:37.409
I thought workhouses
were the stuff of Dickens,

26:37.410 --> 26:39.917
but one of my patients grew up
in one.

26:40.850 --> 26:45.049
And he's never left it. Not really.

26:45.050 --> 26:47.969
It puts a roof over people's heads.

26:47.970 --> 26:50.049
They didn't starve.

26:50.050 --> 26:53.369
It's fate of birth, though,
isn't it?

26:53.370 --> 26:55.929
We've been so lucky, Jimmy.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.769
It's about being good people.

26:58.770 --> 27:01.090
Frank and Peggy are good people.

27:02.850 --> 27:06.970
If I'm not mistaken,
you've finished work for the day.

27:09.410 --> 27:12.529
So, we're officially trespassing?

27:12.530 --> 27:15.610
You always have to split hairs,
don't you?

27:20.970 --> 27:23.089
JIMMY: What do you think?

27:23.090 --> 27:25.330
Look at it, it's amazing!

27:26.450 --> 27:28.370
THEY SQUEAL AND GIGGLE

27:34.770 --> 27:39.809
It's all getting frightfully hot.
And I, for one, want to take a dip.

27:39.810 --> 27:42.570
Come on,
we can always dry our drawers.

27:47.130 --> 27:50.369
Hello.
I'm Chummy, delighted to meet you.

27:50.370 --> 27:51.930
No. Not Chummy.

27:53.090 --> 27:55.290
Dignity, poise, presence.

27:57.650 --> 28:00.730
Hello, I'm Camilla.
It's a delight...

Oh, it's so cold! I've got another
friend who owns a bathhouse.

28:54.730 --> 28:57.089
You're feeling brighter, aren't you?

28:57.090 --> 28:58.609
I knew you would.

28:58.610 --> 29:00.730
I know you better
than you think I do.

29:10.930 --> 29:13.330
I can't, Jimmy.

29:31.090 --> 29:33.049
SHE CHOKES

29:33.050 --> 29:34.370
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

29:40.000 --> 29:41.837
I've got you, I've got you.

29:44.930 --> 29:47.850
It's all right, I've got you.
I've got you, I've got you.

29:50.410 --> 29:51.810
SHE COUGHS

29:56.970 --> 29:58.209
What's the matter?

29:58.210 --> 30:00.609
Breathe. Jenny, have some air.
What's wrong?

30:00.610 --> 30:03.249
Asthma. Cold water
must have shocked her lungs.

30:03.250 --> 30:04.850
Perhaps even the chlorine.

30:06.610 --> 30:09.050
Get a rug, a jacket,
anything that's warm.

30:16.170 --> 30:17.770
Shh.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.450
Thank you, Jimmy.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.169
It's always been you, Jenny.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.610
Always.

31:11.250 --> 31:12.930
SHE SIGHS

31:20.050 --> 31:24.530
The shell must be broken

CLATTERING

31:31.530 --> 31:33.410
CHUMMY: (Fred?)

31:35.050 --> 31:37.089
It's for little Evie.

31:37.090 --> 31:38.809
Something with a bit of cheer.

31:38.810 --> 31:40.770
Only the stale ones, mind.

31:42.410 --> 31:44.809
I didn't understand a word of that.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.169
Evie, my pig.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.889
I should want something other than
just peelings if I was expecting.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.529
The pig's called Evie?

31:51.530 --> 31:55.249
Fred, isn't that
a little near the knuckle?

31:55.250 --> 31:57.649
No, I prefer to think of it
as homage.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.409
Then in honour of her namesake,
I think

32:00.410 --> 32:03.050
we should set our culinary aims
somewhat higher.

32:06.530 --> 32:08.210
I haven't seen a thing.

32:09.730 --> 32:13.129
I certainly haven't seen half
a freshly baked Victoria sandwich.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.449
And I certainly know nothing about
that little crispy bit at the end

32:16.450 --> 32:19.169
that's just begging to be eaten.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.370
I'll leave that bit for you!

32:24.770 --> 32:26.450
Fred?

32:28.210 --> 32:31.849
Am I the sort of girl
a chap's mother would like?

32:31.850 --> 32:34.810
Well, if she didn't,
she wouldn't be worth knowing.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.090
DOOR OPENS

32:52.370 --> 32:55.049
You look as if you've had
what Sister Evangelina calls

32:55.050 --> 32:58.210
"a day of trials
and tribu-bleedin'-lations".

32:59.810 --> 33:02.010
Here, poured too much milk.

33:06.930 --> 33:09.850
I just feel done in by it all.

33:18.450 --> 33:22.130
I feel quite pointless today.

33:24.490 --> 33:27.089
Jimmy is handsome, kind.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.729
And he's mad about you.

33:28.730 --> 33:32.449
And more importantly,
he's in your life, not your past.

33:32.450 --> 33:35.650
So, please,
just forget this man you can't have.

33:37.650 --> 33:40.570
That's just my trouble,
I can't forget him.

33:41.810 --> 33:44.810
He was everything to me,
except mine.

33:54.850 --> 33:56.930
He must have been amazing.

34:02.450 --> 34:04.690
SHE SIGHS

34:06.410 --> 34:09.929
Just in case you're getting too used
to being a gentleman of leisure,

34:09.929 --> 34:11.889
how about you try this?

34:13.530 --> 34:17.168
We're stuck. Two words -

34:17.170 --> 34:19.889
"A clock through the air."

34:21.489 --> 34:23.370
You've got until tomorrow.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.768
I'm dying...

34:38.770 --> 34:40.690
ain't I?

34:52.889 --> 34:56.610
Frank, everyone has
tremendous hope for you.

34:59.410 --> 35:01.490
Don't tell her, love, will you?

35:02.810 --> 35:05.169
You and me both know what's what.

35:05.170 --> 35:08.289
But I don't want my Peg knowing.

35:08.290 --> 35:10.569
Not until she really has to.

35:10.570 --> 35:14.769
For the moment,
we can still have our times.

35:14.770 --> 35:16.410
Peg can still read to me.

35:18.370 --> 35:20.049
Little pleasures, love.

35:20.050 --> 35:24.650
But they mean the world
to both of us.

35:28.530 --> 35:33.090
So let her keep that world,
just as long as she can.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.410
What do I do, Sister?

35:46.610 --> 35:49.170
How do I be without him?

35:54.130 --> 35:59.290
You draw strength from knowing that
one day, you will meet him again.

36:25.170 --> 36:29.490
If you will spare a moment,
I would see it infinitely well spent.

36:33.663 --> 36:38.769
"The sea green of the emerald -
shining together in incredible union."

36:38.770 --> 36:40.637
Where in heaven
did you find silk like this?

36:42.387 --> 36:43.569
It needs a thread or two,

36:43.570 --> 36:49.049
but not beyond your hands
that fly like birds in spring.

36:49.050 --> 36:51.249
It's absolutely perfect.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.369
And it'll be you I have to thank.

36:53.370 --> 36:57.489

and there would be silver

36:57.490 --> 37:00.970

to wor...

37:04.370 --> 37:07.130

Well, I won't lend money.

37:25.210 --> 37:29.649
And I won't dance for your entertainment.
Other than that, ask away.

37:29.650 --> 37:33.130
Could you give me
some of your wonderful pig shit?

37:34.490 --> 37:36.290
I thought you'd never ask!

37:46.810 --> 37:50.170
For the vine.
It does wonders, apparently.

37:52.890 --> 37:55.730
Oh! Let's have a look.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.009
Oof!

37:59.010 --> 38:01.649
You can't buy that sort of quality.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.809
Oh, you are kind.

38:03.810 --> 38:07.690
Maybe we'll make wine after all, eh?
There's a thought to keep us going.

38:08.930 --> 38:12.250
Big and strong, that's
how you'll grow. My little vine.

38:13.970 --> 38:16.250
I want first taste
of anything half decent.

38:22.330 --> 38:24.649

39:21.050 --> 39:24.810

poor little fella didn't make it.

So did I.

39:59.610 --> 40:02.049
You will save her, won't you?

40:02.050 --> 40:06.009
She's my responsibility, see? She's the
only thing I've got what really needs me.

40:06.010 --> 40:09.769
Daft old bugger! We've delivered
half the babies in the parish.

All hands on deck.

40:22.010 --> 40:25.129
No. No, we'll manage, Chummy,

40:25.130 --> 40:26.649
Not to worry.

40:26.650 --> 40:30.370

41:28.810 --> 41:32.049

42:03.170 --> 42:07.049
It's Fred's pig. He's in an awful state

42:07.050 --> 42:11.249
we have another little sadness.
Seven so far.

42:11.250 --> 42:14.450
I'm hoping I can sponge
the worst of this off.

'even if that search took
a lifetime.'

58:01.770 --> 58:06.209
Do you understand the nature
of the charges brought against you?

58:06.210 --> 58:07.889
I do.

58:07.890 --> 58:12.529
Oh, look, I'm in jail.
Hello, Sister Monica Joan!

58:12.530 --> 58:13.650
I want to meet your mother.

58:15.170 --> 58:16.250
Hello, Mater.

58:19.090 --> 58:22.329
If I may interject, Sister.
Who is this person?

58:22.330 --> 58:23.889
He is your barrister.

58:23.890 --> 58:25.490
He's not very good.

58:26.850 --> 58:29.157
Chummy, you aren't thinking
of taking Holy Orders?

58:29.293 --> 58:31.809
It has presented itself as a solution.

58:31.810 --> 58:33.290
Cathy?

58:35.243 --> 58:36.717
I rest my case.
