02:42.388 --> 02:44.494
Stop, stop.
Stop!

03:06.211 --> 03:09.819
Come on, sneaky.
Hang in there. You can make it.

03:43.983 --> 03:46.456
Are you okay?

04:00.099 --> 04:02.235
Fat fuck.

04:02.335 --> 04:04.874
He didn't go hungry in the war.

04:06.939 --> 04:09.543
It might be his glands.

04:09.643 --> 04:12.182
They're called glands, right?

04:13.779 --> 04:17.817
Thyroid does not produce enough hormones
so body does not assimilate fat.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.687
Glands.
My brother told me that.

04:20.786 --> 04:24.628
- Yeah, your brother is a doctor?
- No, fatso.

04:32.831 --> 04:34.634
What are they laughing at?

04:34.734 --> 04:37.037
He's just saying funny things, you know.

04:37.137 --> 04:40.707
- Yeah, I can tell that.
- It's normal here.

04:40.807 --> 04:45.615
This area is famous for that.
Yoghurt and sense of humor.

04:46.745 --> 04:51.187
They always say funny things.
That's why people invite them to weddings.

04:51.984 --> 04:55.655
Trust Damir, when you get married
invite somebody from here.

04:55.755 --> 05:00.763
They're always laughing.
Babies here are born laughing, not crying.

05:02.361 --> 05:05.966
Most famous comedian
in my country is born here.

05:06.066 --> 05:08.835
Petrovich.
You know Petrovich?

05:08.935 --> 05:11.502
No, I don't know Petrovich.

05:11.602 --> 05:15.430
He tells famous Albanian in bathtub joke.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.979
- It's great.
- Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.

05:19.079 --> 05:23.516
He tells it for 30 years and people
always laugh every time he tells.

05:23.616 --> 05:26.186
30 years, always same joke.

05:26.286 --> 05:29.189
Yeah, and that might be him in the well.

05:29.289 --> 05:32.028
Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.

05:38.914 --> 05:41.388
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

05:44.503 --> 05:46.973
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

05:47.073 --> 05:49.812
Copy, Mambru!
This is B! Go!

05:51.142 --> 05:54.147
<i>Do you have any rope in the car?
Over.</i>

05:54.247 --> 05:56.516
I can't hear you.
Come back with that!

05:56.616 --> 05:59.419
<i>Do you have any rope in the car?
Over.</i>

05:59.519 --> 06:02.989
- Negative. No rope. No rope on board.
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:03.089 --> 06:06.393
- <i>We'll be out of here in 15. Over and out.</i>
- Copy that. Over and out.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.957
Watch where you step.

06:36.121 --> 06:38.661
They want us to drive around it.

06:39.091 --> 06:41.028
How do you know?

06:41.428 --> 06:43.667
It's a trap.

06:44.663 --> 06:47.203
See that grass there?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.640
They dragged it here.

06:52.104 --> 06:54.307
See, they put mines on one side

06:54.407 --> 06:57.744
so that when you drive around it, boom.
Game over.

06:57.844 --> 07:00.183
The question is which side?

07:00.979 --> 07:02.249
Well, we'd better turn around.

07:02.349 --> 07:05.151
- They would expect us to go right.
- You think so?

07:05.251 --> 07:08.955
But if we were coming
from the other side, then...

07:09.055 --> 07:11.558
right would be left, so...

07:12.158 --> 07:14.594
B, there was another road back there.

07:14.794 --> 07:17.130
Maybe they know.

07:17.230 --> 07:20.165
- Maybe they know what?
- Maybe they know we know.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.603
- Yeah, but we don't know!
- Unless they're fucking with us.

07:23.703 --> 07:27.640
Well, come on, B. Just... Let's turn around.
There was another road back there...

07:27.740 --> 07:28.908
- You hear that?
- No.

07:29.008 --> 07:31.578
- That!
- What?

07:31.678 --> 07:34.784
- RPGs.
- What's that?

07:35.948 --> 07:37.750
- Grenades.
- No, I didn't hear any grenades.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.086
Oui, oui, oui, yeah.
No way we're going back that way.

07:40.186 --> 07:42.389
That's not gonna happen.

07:42.889 --> 07:45.058
Mr. cow...

07:45.158 --> 07:47.861
is it to the left or to the right?

07:47.961 --> 07:50.200
You're asking the cow?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.969
Let's go.

07:54.199 --> 07:57.673
- Are we turning around?
- RPGs.

08:01.406 --> 08:03.846
It's all here in my logbook.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.713
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking it up.

08:06.813 --> 08:09.716
- Mining protocol says to turn around.
- Mining protocol.

08:09.816 --> 08:12.285
Don't believe everything
you read in mining protocol.

08:12.385 --> 08:14.421
They write that stuff in Geneva.

08:14.521 --> 08:16.756
They've never seen a mine
in their lives in Geneva.

08:16.856 --> 08:20.460
Cows, yes, plenty of cows
but none with mines around 'em.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.696
This is my protocol, not Geneva.

08:23.796 --> 08:25.866
There it is.

08:26.266 --> 08:29.845
What? Is that my handwriting?
What the fuck does that say...

08:29.945 --> 08:32.125
But I don't know what it says.
It says to turn around.

08:32.225 --> 08:35.241
No, look. Look, right there.
What is that? That's a cow.

08:35.342 --> 08:37.202
- It's a dog.
- It's not a dog.

08:37.302 --> 08:40.847
- Yes, it's a dog...
- Dogs don't have horns. That's a cow.

08:40.947 --> 08:44.453
That's an arrow and it says to go right.

08:46.285 --> 08:48.288
Or left?

08:48.888 --> 08:51.658
Fuck it.
We're late.

08:51.908 --> 08:54.127
- We're sick of cows.
- No, no! What are you doing...

08:54.227 --> 08:56.596
Arrows and all of this fucking bullshit.

08:56.696 --> 08:59.699
No, no, no!
No, we have to go back, B!

08:59.799 --> 09:02.435
No, please! We have to go back!
Don't you dare...

09:02.535 --> 09:06.511
- Catch a tiger by the toe.
- No, no, no. No.

09:06.611 --> 09:08.794
If he hollers...

09:19.551 --> 09:22.959
<i>Putain!</i> I hate you!
I just... I hate you.

09:23.059 --> 09:26.963
I hate you!
Fucking crazy!

09:30.797 --> 09:35.238
They brought him from somewhere else
and throw into well to spoil water.

09:36.635 --> 09:41.477
They hear them when they came with car.
With loud music, boom, boom, boom.

09:42.975 --> 09:46.212
When they came out this morning,
fat guy was in well.

09:46.312 --> 09:48.117
Well.

09:49.415 --> 09:51.751
He wants to know where you're from.

09:51.851 --> 09:55.054
- Puerto Rico.
- Puerto Rico. American.

09:55.759 --> 09:59.225
- Piculin Ortiz.
- Yes, Piculin Ortiz...

09:59.325 --> 10:04.440
- Great basketball player.
- Yes, very good. Piculin Ortiz, very good.

10:06.565 --> 10:10.703
He asks why you're here.
Don't you have woman who loves you at home?

10:10.803 --> 10:14.102
Tell him I do.
That's why I'm here.

10:17.509 --> 10:21.818
He says you're funny like you're from here.
You know, the same sense of humor.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.522
Okay.

10:32.457 --> 10:35.824
I'll never get in a car with you again,
you got that? Never again.

10:35.924 --> 10:38.298
- What happened?
- He doesn't give a shit about rules.

10:38.398 --> 10:41.901
She wanted to go one way, me, another.
It's always the same with chicks.

10:42.001 --> 10:43.937
You ran over a cow!
We could have blown up!

10:44.037 --> 10:47.040
- I consulted my notebook.
- Your notebook?

10:47.140 --> 10:49.479
You're not gonna say anything?

10:52.711 --> 10:55.951
- Shit, B.
- Shit, B?

10:56.748 --> 10:58.785
Is that all?

10:58.885 --> 11:00.893
What do you want me to say?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.690
I'm... I don't know.
You're in charge of security here.

11:03.790 --> 11:06.559
What will you do next?
Send him to bed without dessert?

11:06.659 --> 11:10.129
Dessert?
I didn't know there was dessert here.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.265
Mambru, everything was under control.

11:12.365 --> 11:16.135
You know me. There was nothing crazy
about it. Intuitive, maybe. But not crazy.

11:16.235 --> 11:18.171
Sophie.

11:18.271 --> 11:21.708
He knew there was nothing
underneath that cow.

11:21.808 --> 11:24.547
He was just... showing off for you.

11:25.377 --> 11:27.614
Sophie, come on!
Sophie.

11:28.014 --> 11:32.752
She's adorable!
And you are getting no respect from her.

11:32.852 --> 11:35.261
Did you know about this dessert?

11:36.922 --> 11:39.462
Glad I only got one more week here.

11:40.926 --> 11:42.632
<i>Putain!</i>

11:44.097 --> 11:45.968
What?

11:47.899 --> 11:50.170
- It's a dude!
- I know it's a dude.

11:50.270 --> 11:53.124
- You said a corpse on the radio.
- So?

11:53.224 --> 11:55.975
A corpse could be anything.
It could be a dog, a pig, a...

11:56.075 --> 11:59.078
Sophie, a corpse is a corpse.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.715
- A dead dog is not a corpse.
- She's French.

12:02.815 --> 12:04.884
A dead dog is corpse...

12:04.984 --> 12:06.989
technically.

12:08.154 --> 12:11.493
- Is this her first?
- Yep.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.865
He's gigantic.

12:19.598 --> 12:21.501
- Is he from the village?
- No.

12:21.601 --> 12:24.404
They brought this guy from somewhere else.

12:24.504 --> 12:27.750
- I thought they do it with animals.
- Not in war.

12:27.850 --> 12:31.878
Nobody throws an animal in a well.
Wasted food.

12:31.978 --> 12:34.650
B, give me a hand with the pipe.

12:36.248 --> 12:38.918
For how long has he been in the well?

12:39.018 --> 12:42.091
12 hours.
10, maybe.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.624
So what's our expert say?

12:44.724 --> 12:46.959
We have to get it out and clean the well.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.896
In 24 hours, it won't matter
what we pour in there.

12:49.996 --> 12:53.733
- We'll have to seal it.
- We'll get the blue helmets to help.

12:53.833 --> 12:58.504
At least this one's in one piece.
They usually chop it up, you know.

12:58.604 --> 13:01.007
It speeds up the decay.

13:01.107 --> 13:04.777
It's disgusting, but...
there's a good side to it.

13:04.877 --> 13:07.413
It gets easier to get 'em out of there

13:07.513 --> 13:10.719
you know, when they're...
when they're in chunks.

13:12.818 --> 13:15.825
- So, you know.
- Hey.

13:16.988 --> 13:21.354
He says there's a small store
in Drusina Village. It's nearby.

13:21.454 --> 13:24.033
And they might have rope there.

13:27.466 --> 13:31.040
Is he your first, dogs aside?

13:33.071 --> 13:34.741
Really?

13:34.841 --> 13:37.043
Unbelievable.

13:37.243 --> 13:40.780
It's important moment, your first corpse.
You never forget it.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.183
It's like your first girlfriend
or the first time you get laid.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.003
I remember the first time I got laid
but my first corpse,

13:47.103 --> 13:49.858
that shit is burned in my memory.

13:50.689 --> 13:53.393
I'll never forget that face, man.

13:53.493 --> 13:56.662
- Was it terrible?
- No, it wasn't terrible.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.998
It was... it was nice.

13:59.098 --> 14:03.069
She was... 17, red head, nice body.

14:03.169 --> 14:05.538
- The corpse?
- No, my...

14:05.638 --> 14:09.452
The girl, the first girl I slept with.
What's wrong with you?

14:09.942 --> 14:11.444
That's sick.

14:11.544 --> 14:16.048
Sophie! You're gonna ride with me
to the security briefing.

14:16.148 --> 14:20.490
- B, you're going with Damir to Drusina.
- Drusina.

14:31.062 --> 14:33.702
There are 2 more wells to the west.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.773
About 12 kilometers...

14:38.070 --> 14:39.605
in Nisinje.

14:39.705 --> 14:42.442
Yeah, they were both mined last week.

14:42.542 --> 14:47.580
We informed UNPROFOR
but it'll take a while to demine them.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.050
Even if wells are a priority... it's gonna
take at least a couple days...

14:51.150 --> 14:53.018
Attention!

14:53.240 --> 14:55.457
Fuck!

14:58.990 --> 15:00.827
Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!

15:01.027 --> 15:03.098
Don't touch him!

15:03.845 --> 15:08.188
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.643
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.180
- What?
- That's my ball!

15:18.810 --> 15:22.682
That's his ball. He's a little boy.
Give him his ball. Give him back his ball.

15:23.082 --> 15:25.823
It's his ball.
He's a kid.

15:27.786 --> 15:29.625
No, no, no, no, no.

15:32.591 --> 15:34.827
Sophie, get back in the car.

15:34.927 --> 15:38.097
We're friends, friends.
We go, we go, we leave.

15:38.197 --> 15:42.001
Friends. Nema problema.
Nema problema, okay?

15:42.101 --> 15:44.937
We go, we go.

15:45.037 --> 15:47.874
Get back.
You wanna get killed?

15:47.974 --> 15:50.913
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

15:52.143 --> 15:55.047
- What's your name?
- Nikola.

15:55.147 --> 15:58.985
Nikola, how about I get you
a new ball, brand-new ball?

15:59.085 --> 16:00.620
Where?

16:01.020 --> 16:03.423
Base camp.
Soldiers have ball. Deal?

16:03.523 --> 16:07.263
- You pick ball and I drive you back.
- Deal.

16:35.387 --> 16:38.758
That Frenchy whatsome has got
a mouth on her. Let me tell you.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.761
Mambru wouldn't have taken that shit
from anyone couple of years ago.

16:41.861 --> 16:45.467
He would have thrown her
in the well with the fat fucker.

16:45.930 --> 16:48.935
He's good at what he does
but he has not been the same lately.

16:49.035 --> 16:53.242
He's... talking about giving it all up.

16:53.672 --> 16:57.643
You see, there's this girl...

16:57.743 --> 16:59.645
back home...

16:59.745 --> 17:02.014
waiting for him.

17:02.114 --> 17:05.151
White picket fence, homemade apple pie,

17:05.251 --> 17:09.055
swings set out back.
You know, the whole kit and caboodle.

17:09.155 --> 17:12.694
He's not the same. He's just like
he's here, but he's not here.

17:14.125 --> 17:17.496
- You know what I mean?
- No.

17:17.596 --> 17:22.151
What I'm saying is even though
he's here, he is not here.

17:22.251 --> 17:24.857
He is somewhere else.

17:27.271 --> 17:30.309
Women, Damir!
They change you.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.846
I got changed by one too.
I wasn't always like this.

17:32.946 --> 17:35.306
- Like what?
- Like I am now.

17:35.406 --> 17:37.449
Were you more articulate?

17:37.549 --> 17:41.710
Shit, Damir. You're an interpreter.
Interpret me, for fuck's sake.

17:50.495 --> 17:52.534
What the fuck.

17:57.904 --> 18:02.345
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1.
Come in.</i>

18:03.875 --> 18:06.379
Yeah, copy.
What's up?

18:07.279 --> 18:09.785
<i>Besides rope, I need a ball.
Over.</i>

18:10.615 --> 18:13.455
Come back with that.
What was that?

18:13.985 --> 18:16.622
<i>Ball.
Bravo Alfa Lima Lima.</i>

18:16.722 --> 18:18.558
<i>A soccer ball.</i>

18:18.658 --> 18:23.805
- Can you understand this guy?
- Perfectly. He said ball, right?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.614
Eldar!

19:14.714 --> 19:17.716
- Turn the car around!
- There is no problem here.

19:17.816 --> 19:21.720
Well, the front facing out, ready to leave.
Come on, Nikola, get in.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.622
I already have 3 kids.

19:23.722 --> 19:27.562
You stay with Eldar,
I go inside and get ball.

19:27.692 --> 19:29.562
Okay?

19:29.762 --> 19:32.264
- Who's leaving?
- Coming.

19:32.364 --> 19:35.368
I just come from airport
to pick up new lady.

19:35.868 --> 19:38.592
New lady?
What's her name?

19:38.692 --> 19:43.042
I forget. When I saw her,
I forget everything. Even war.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.146
She hot?

19:46.145 --> 19:48.016
How hot?

19:49.614 --> 19:52.585
3?
Out of 10?

19:52.685 --> 19:56.359
- Out of 3.
- 3 out of 3?

20:00.825 --> 20:02.862
She Russian?

20:02.962 --> 20:05.531
I told you, I forget.

20:05.631 --> 20:08.170
Okay.
Turn the car around.

20:10.802 --> 20:14.473
- 3 what?
- Nothing, 3 days.

20:14.573 --> 20:18.213
He hasn't slept in 3 days.
Fucking war.

21:16.392 --> 21:19.192
[- What's the Russian doing here?
- Who do you mean?]

21:19.292 --> 21:21.567
[That nutcase, Katya.]

21:21.667 --> 21:25.717
[Did you know she wrote Sarah
three letters? Very nice letters.]

21:25.817 --> 21:29.551
[Describing our little affair
in wonderful detail.]

21:36.084 --> 21:39.067
[Now she's here and I knew nothing of it.]

21:39.167 --> 21:40.609
[That's not fair, Goyo.]

21:40.709 --> 21:43.682
[Maybe we should have consulted you, right?]

21:43.782 --> 21:48.142
[Well, I'm head of security, but who cares?]

21:48.242 --> 21:51.734
[Goyo, this is basically another war.]

21:51.959 --> 21:53.484
[What do we have to do?]

21:53.584 --> 21:57.009
[Ask you whenever we move somebody,
in case you poked her?]

21:57.109 --> 22:00.734
[Don't exaggerate.
All I'm saying is let me know first.]

22:00.834 --> 22:03.984
[Tune me in, grab the radio and say,]

22:04.084 --> 22:06.912
["Mambru,
the Russian's coming in Saturday,]

22:07.012 --> 22:11.151
[then she's leaving. Over and out."
Simple as that, but no...]

22:11.251 --> 22:14.859
[She's staying four days,
writing her evaluation, then going.]

22:14.959 --> 22:16.709
[Hold on...]

22:18.126 --> 22:20.542
[Are you calling off the operation?]

22:21.334 --> 22:22.934
[Come on, she'll tell you.]

22:23.034 --> 22:26.672
We've registered very little military
activity since the cease-fire

22:26.772 --> 22:28.579
came into effect.

22:28.679 --> 22:33.112
There've been... minor altercations...

22:33.212 --> 22:35.648
but I repeat, the area is quite calm.

22:36.048 --> 22:38.818
- The conflict, as you know, is nearly over.
- Fucking idiots.

22:38.918 --> 22:41.453
- Peace agreements underway...
- What's wrong?

22:41.553 --> 22:46.525
...an obligation for all parties
to facilitate the location of mines

22:46.625 --> 22:50.963
or any other threat to humanitarian
and United Nations' personnel

22:51.063 --> 22:54.169
but as you know, that isn't always easy.

22:54.499 --> 22:59.038
Water.
Our sector is supplied by 3 wells.

22:59.138 --> 23:01.807
Davari and Nisinje are still mined

23:01.907 --> 23:06.078
but the third is functional with enough
capacity to supply the surrounding villages.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.183
Excuse me, sir.

23:09.614 --> 23:11.684
Negative.
The third well is not functional.

23:11.784 --> 23:14.153
- We were just there.
- What's wrong with it?

23:14.253 --> 23:17.389
Somebody threw a corpse in it
to contaminate the water.

23:17.489 --> 23:20.062
Someone should remove it.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.929
The mines are our priority.

23:24.029 --> 23:27.602
But then remove the mines
from the other two.

23:29.634 --> 23:33.172
- Please identify yourself.
- Sophie Richard...

23:33.272 --> 23:37.278
water and sanitation, aid across borders.

23:38.409 --> 23:40.245
According to my reports,
that well is clean.

23:40.345 --> 23:43.449
Well, but according to my nose
there is a body rotting inside.

23:43.549 --> 23:47.556
So it must be removed,
so we can purify the water.

23:53.524 --> 23:55.363
Hey.

23:56.428 --> 23:58.300
Madam!

24:00.231 --> 24:02.070
Ma'am!

24:02.917 --> 24:04.956
Get out of there!

24:06.971 --> 24:09.241
Get out of there!

24:09.641 --> 24:11.477
Careful.

24:11.827 --> 24:14.199
You're gonna get yourself killed.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.989
What's she saying?

24:22.386 --> 24:26.995
They ask her to stop
'cause there could be mines in the field.

24:28.359 --> 24:30.963
She says, "I have to go home.

24:31.063 --> 24:34.336
There's no other way.
You think I can fly?"

24:35.966 --> 24:40.406
But there is no problems.
I mean, she walks behind cows, see?

24:40.506 --> 24:42.941
Do you understand?
Mines!

24:43.041 --> 24:45.844
Yeah.
She follows the cows.

24:45.944 --> 24:49.948
- Get out of there. It's dangerous!
- Smart.

24:50.048 --> 24:52.684
"International humanitarian
law as established

24:52.784 --> 24:55.654
"by the Geneva convention prohibits...

24:55.754 --> 24:57.356
"article 55,

24:57.656 --> 25:02.428
"using environmental modification
techniques with hostile aims

25:02.528 --> 25:06.970
"in order to protect the health
of the population during wartime."

25:08.766 --> 25:11.403
I appreciate the reminder, Ms. Richard,

25:11.653 --> 25:14.490
but that article, as you correctly stated

25:14.590 --> 25:17.026
refers only to international
armed conflicts.

25:17.176 --> 25:19.378
Well, that's true, sir,

25:19.478 --> 25:22.517
but neither of us has a Bosnian accent.

25:23.414 --> 25:26.853
Our passports do not make
this an international conflict

25:26.877 --> 25:27.877
despite your insistence.

25:27.953 --> 25:30.355
Your request is duly noted

25:30.455 --> 25:35.931
but leave it to the military
to establish priorities during wartime.

25:36.327 --> 25:41.700
As for the rest... the curfew will remain
in effect throughout the area.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.869
All circulation is prohibited between...

25:43.969 --> 25:47.977
- You're not gonna say anything?
- Let it go. They are in charge.

25:57.365 --> 25:59.938
Sir, he's mined.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.990
The corpse.

26:05.090 --> 26:07.960
My colleague has reminded me
it might be...

26:08.060 --> 26:11.063
It's not unusual.
They do it sometimes, as you know.

26:11.163 --> 26:14.800
- So we won't touch it.
- Have you handled the body?

26:14.900 --> 26:17.970
No, mining protocol
prohibits from doing so, sir.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.709
That's your jurisdiction.

26:27.784 --> 26:29.542
[Take her to the base.]

26:29.642 --> 26:32.309
[Don't complicate it even more.]

26:32.409 --> 26:37.291
[- I have enough problems.
- Problems. What problems are those?]

26:37.967 --> 26:40.876
[For example, the nag
you saw in the meeting.]

26:41.125 --> 26:43.095
Sophie!

26:43.195 --> 26:46.435
- Fighting the UN is not gonna help.
- Yeah, but they won't listen to me!

26:46.542 --> 26:48.351
[See?]

26:49.117 --> 26:52.774
[- Was it her first death?]
- Yep.

26:54.492 --> 26:58.937
[Goyo, if Sarah finds out Katya's here...]

26:59.401 --> 27:00.604
[Holy shit!]

27:00.834 --> 27:02.884
[She's far away.
Who's going to tell her?]

27:03.034 --> 27:04.251
[Katya.]

27:04.451 --> 27:08.301
[All your problems have to do with women.]

27:09.301 --> 27:13.662
[I have another little problem.]
Nikola! Come here!

27:15.026 --> 27:17.229
This is Goyo, <i>my boss.</i>

27:17.329 --> 27:20.068
- Shake hands.
- Hello.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.684
Ball?

27:22.784 --> 27:25.103
[See?
Every man for himself.]

27:25.203 --> 27:27.639
- No ball?
- Sorry, Nikola, no ball.

27:27.739 --> 27:30.075
The Spanish battalion
is 40 kilometers away.

27:30.175 --> 27:32.010
They might have rope there.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.580
Goyo, your escort request.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.583
Were not going anywhere.
We're going back to the base.

27:37.683 --> 27:40.619
- What about the fat guy?
- Fat guy stays, we leave.

27:40.719 --> 27:43.355
- But there will be an epidemic.
- Maybe.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.290
But with any luck, I'll be gone by then.

27:46.390 --> 27:47.492
Okay, beautiful.

27:47.592 --> 27:51.196
Not our problem anymore.
They said not to touch it.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.632
Tell your assistant
to take it easy, Mambru.

27:53.732 --> 27:57.169
I'm not his assistant.
We work together.

27:57.269 --> 27:59.938
Maybe you shouldn't
have said he was mined.

28:00.038 --> 28:02.641
Besides we have to take
the new girl to the base.

28:02.741 --> 28:05.477
Go ahead and tell B we're gonna
drop the kid off at the well.

28:05.577 --> 28:09.017
He should meet us there.
Go ahead.

28:11.717 --> 28:14.126
[You'll miss all this.]

28:23.261 --> 28:25.731
This your girlfriend?

28:25.831 --> 28:28.533
What?
Don't joke like that.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.172
Come on, get in the car.

28:43.914 --> 28:47.152
You know you can't transport civilians
in a conflict area, right?

28:47.252 --> 28:51.361
We're not transporting him.
We're keeping him out of trouble.

28:52.791 --> 28:57.065
Sure.
Some things never change.

28:57.728 --> 29:00.098
It hasn't been that long.

29:00.198 --> 29:03.503
It hasn't?
How long?

29:04.703 --> 29:08.173
- Two years?
- One and a half.

29:08.273 --> 29:10.111
Well...

29:10.541 --> 29:13.348
You look different
from the last time I saw you.

29:15.279 --> 29:17.749
Sure, I'm dressed.

29:17.849 --> 29:21.871
That's right.
You are dressed. But...

29:22.921 --> 29:27.092
- your hair was different.
- My head is what was different.

29:27.192 --> 29:31.165
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2 for Mike 1, do you copy?
Over.</i>

29:34.432 --> 29:38.340
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2 for Mike 1, do you copy?
Over.</i>

29:39.437 --> 29:41.243
Hi.

29:43.641 --> 29:46.314
Rope.
Damir, rope.

30:10.668 --> 30:12.837
What's the problem?

30:12.937 --> 30:14.973
There is no rope.

30:15.073 --> 30:19.347
What do you mean there's no rope?
There's plenty of rope. I'm touching it.

30:22.313 --> 30:26.354
- Please don't touch merchandise, he says.
- Alright.

30:29.819 --> 30:31.289
He asked me...

30:31.389 --> 30:33.959
why we need the rope for,
so I explained him.

30:34.059 --> 30:38.130
And he told me that if somebody
throw man in a well

30:38.230 --> 30:41.667
he probably was no saint
and it's better to leave him there.

30:41.867 --> 30:45.406
Never touch dead people, he says.

30:51.610 --> 30:55.065
How much? How much?
Money. How much?

31:06.123 --> 31:08.593
He says that...

31:08.693 --> 31:11.332
they need rope for hangings.

31:12.062 --> 31:14.702
He's kidding, right?

31:15.499 --> 31:17.302
I don't know.

31:17.402 --> 31:20.575
Sense of humor
is bit different in this area.

31:45.262 --> 31:47.768
How are things with Sarah, Mambru?

31:49.433 --> 31:51.036
Fine.

31:51.136 --> 31:53.238
We ran into each other.
Did she tell you?

31:54.821 --> 31:57.909
- No.
- Incredible, isn't it?

31:58.009 --> 32:01.866
- After everything that happened.
- Incredible.

32:03.047 --> 32:06.485
In a showroom, furniture.
She was looking at bedrooms.

32:06.585 --> 32:09.290
- She said you were moving.
- Yeah?

32:11.021 --> 32:14.794
- She was having doubts.
- She was having doubts about what?

32:15.894 --> 32:20.416
Between the two colors, salmon or beige.
Which one did she finally pick?

32:20.516 --> 32:24.836
No idea.
She handles that part, the color part.

32:24.936 --> 32:28.974
But I am there if she needs my opinion,
of course... to support her.

32:29.674 --> 32:32.714
That's what couples are all about, right?

32:32.943 --> 32:34.749
Support.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.452
Of course.

32:38.548 --> 32:42.053
I was actually looking at bedrooms too.
Can you believe it?

32:42.153 --> 32:46.327
- You?
- Yeah, with Bernal.

32:48.359 --> 32:51.008
So you and Bernal are back together?

32:51.108 --> 32:53.318
Looks like it.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.935
What color did you pick?

32:58.777 --> 32:59.924
Salmon.

33:08.279 --> 33:11.583
Difficult to know.
Many problems here.

33:11.683 --> 33:16.154
Maybe they're enemies and they don't
want you to remove body from well.

33:16.554 --> 33:19.947
- Or maybe they put it there.
- You think?

33:20.047 --> 33:22.594
Could be.
You know, things are complicated.

33:22.694 --> 33:26.634
Whatever you think... it's possible here.

33:27.698 --> 33:30.268
Or maybe you are foreigner

33:30.368 --> 33:32.771
and that's why they don't sell you rope.

33:33.071 --> 33:36.375
Many people hate foreigners
because they come with war.

33:36.675 --> 33:38.927
You remind them
that everything is bad here.

33:39.027 --> 33:43.935
You know, the bombs, the deaths
and so they hate you for that.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.691
What's that sign saying?

33:52.991 --> 33:55.396
"UN convoy, stay...

33:59.096 --> 34:00.769
back."

34:01.265 --> 34:05.373
You see the size of that escort?
Military target.

34:15.313 --> 34:17.449
They're taking meat to the refugees.

34:17.549 --> 34:20.118
You might as well paint
a bull's eye on your chest.

34:20.217 --> 34:24.443
The further away you get from these guys,
the better. You get what I'm saying?

34:27.056 --> 34:29.063
What's that?

34:38.636 --> 34:40.876
I told her I was coming.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.842
You told Sarah
we were gonna see each other?

34:44.943 --> 34:47.409
Yeah, because of the evaluation.

34:48.946 --> 34:52.149
- You're not mad, are you?
- About which part?

34:52.248 --> 34:56.556
- What evaluation?
- Yeah. What evaluation?

34:57.721 --> 35:00.967
We need to check if the mission still
makes sense. If the cost is justified.

35:01.067 --> 35:04.829
- And that's up to you?
- We don't have unlimited resources, Mambru.

35:04.929 --> 35:07.132
Never mind your report.

35:07.232 --> 35:09.401
Tell them we can't leave.

35:09.501 --> 35:12.137
- But you're leaving next week.
- So what?

35:12.237 --> 35:14.973
Me leaving is one thing,
all of us leaving is another.

35:15.173 --> 35:17.659
This is almost over, Mambru.
Peace is coming.

35:17.759 --> 35:20.898
- Don't you watch the news?
- I don't.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.318
I'm too busy pulling bodies out of wells.

35:24.882 --> 35:28.656
But peace may come,
the problems don't disappear.

35:29.386 --> 35:32.059
This is gonna be
an emergency zone for a long while.

35:32.159 --> 35:34.384
[What's this?]

36:03.287 --> 36:07.495
- What are you doing?
- $6 each.

36:18.202 --> 36:20.642
You know they need water.

36:21.405 --> 36:25.780
You understand?
It's not fair.

36:30.514 --> 36:32.853
You know they need water?

36:34.052 --> 36:35.887
Sophie.

36:36.087 --> 36:39.694
- Sophie. Sophie!
- You know it's not fair.

36:47.431 --> 36:49.971
They're taking advantage of them.

36:50.951 --> 36:54.158
Of course, they are.
This is war.

36:55.706 --> 36:58.246
Come on, let's get back to the car.

37:03.180 --> 37:07.819
What bastards.
$6 for water and that's how we help people.

37:07.919 --> 37:11.856
We can't get the body out.
We got no rope.

37:11.956 --> 37:14.960
- You don't have any rope?
- It broke.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.996
We have to do what we have to do.
Get the body out and clean the water.

37:18.096 --> 37:21.341
- Sophie, we're not allowed to touch it.
- Yeah, what's wrong with you?

37:21.441 --> 37:25.469
Weren't you in the room? Mambru is right.
He's doing what he was told.

37:25.569 --> 37:28.006
Please don't agree with me.

37:28.106 --> 37:29.941
Tough shit.
If you're right, you're right.

37:30.041 --> 37:33.147
They give you an order, you follow it.
Period.

37:55.866 --> 37:59.841
Let me do the talking.
Don't say a word. You'll see.

38:14.584 --> 38:17.422
This is storage?
Supplies?

38:17.522 --> 38:19.240
Storage, yes.

38:19.490 --> 38:23.527
We are Pomoc.
Aid workers.

38:23.627 --> 38:27.532
We have a problem.
Big problem. We need a rope.

38:27.632 --> 38:29.971
Do you have any rope?

38:31.802 --> 38:34.041
Rope, like...

38:39.343 --> 38:42.380
There's a... there is a...
there is a corpse.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.217
A corpse.
Dead fucker in a well.

38:46.317 --> 38:50.322
And we need to get it out.
So we need rope.

38:50.722 --> 38:55.126
So the people could drink the water.
You understand?

38:55.626 --> 38:57.465
Water.

38:58.395 --> 39:01.366
No water here.
War, sorry.

39:01.466 --> 39:04.435
No... no.
We don't need no water.

39:04.535 --> 39:06.070
- Only... what's rope?
- Konapac.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.139
Kono... konopac, no water.

39:08.239 --> 39:10.642
No water, no konopac.

39:10.742 --> 39:13.748
No nothing.
War, sorry.

39:19.048 --> 39:21.422
- Should I?
- Yeah.

39:34.965 --> 39:37.501
Hey, hey!

39:37.601 --> 39:39.540
Konopac.

39:40.804 --> 39:45.209
- You lend me this one. Two hours.
- No, no, no. Not possible.

39:45.309 --> 39:48.025
- Not possible.
- Not the flag. Just the rope.

39:48.125 --> 39:53.718
It's my... country.
You take rope. Flag down.

39:53.818 --> 39:56.621
This is war.
Flag down, not possible.

39:56.721 --> 40:00.258
We know, we know, we know this is war.
We only want the rope.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.994
Flag down, we surrender.

40:03.094 --> 40:07.098
Me, kaput.
They... me.

40:07.198 --> 40:08.833
Understand?

40:08.933 --> 40:12.070
This is war.
Flag down, not possible.

40:12.170 --> 40:15.242
You gotta make a choice, flag or water?

40:20.310 --> 40:23.351
<i>Mike 1, Mike 1, this is Mike 2.
Copy?</i>

40:26.082 --> 40:29.924
Mike 2, this is Mike 1.
How did it go over there? Over.

40:30.621 --> 40:35.696
Not good. There was rope.
But there's no rope.

40:36.559 --> 40:40.331
<i>I didn't copy that.
Can you give that to me again? Over.</i>

40:40.431 --> 40:43.070
No rope, no rope.

40:43.967 --> 40:45.773
Shit.

40:47.304 --> 40:50.210
<i>Okay, we'll wait for you here.
Over and out.</i>

40:54.544 --> 40:58.986
Maybe they throw man in the well
so they can sell water.

41:05.522 --> 41:07.394
Maybe.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.224
You need rope?

41:39.624 --> 41:42.763
- Yeah.
- I know where you find.

41:44.527 --> 41:47.098
Yeah?
Where?

41:47.198 --> 41:51.038
In my house. Not far.
I'll take you.

41:55.105 --> 41:57.545
And how long is this rope?

41:58.208 --> 42:00.081
Long.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.385
Show me.

42:29.506 --> 42:32.777
<i>Yeah, there was a change of plans.
We're heading over to Dukovo.</i>

42:33.077 --> 42:35.921
- Apparently there's rope there.
- <i>Who says?</i>

42:36.021 --> 42:37.784
Rope?

42:38.448 --> 42:40.751
Local sources.
Over and out.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.787
Aren't we going back to the base?

42:42.887 --> 42:46.190
Yeah, but first we're gonna
get our friend out of the well.

42:46.290 --> 42:48.226
- You're not allowed.
- Says who?

42:48.326 --> 42:50.561
The United Nations.
They said you can't do it.

42:50.661 --> 42:54.265
I don't take orders from them.
I'm not wearing a helmet.

42:54.365 --> 42:56.767
It was just explained
to you by an official.

42:56.867 --> 42:59.148
Who do we need to get for you
to understand? Butros Ghali?

42:59.204 --> 43:01.873
Yeah.
Butros Butros-Ghali.

43:01.973 --> 43:05.476
I want him to come here and explain to me
why the hell we can't get the body

43:05.576 --> 43:08.383
- out of that well.
- I can't talk to you.

43:22.191 --> 43:24.829
I'm never gonna make my meeting.

43:24.929 --> 43:28.800
You know it's a good thing you're getting
to see what's going on here first hand.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.220
It's just gonna help your report.

43:30.303 --> 43:33.804
Don't make this personal.
I was sent by headquarters.

43:33.904 --> 43:36.207
It's always personal.

43:36.307 --> 43:40.643
<i>Mambru, you got 2 people in the back seat.
Are you aware of that?</i>

44:07.203 --> 44:10.845
- Nikola, left or right?
- Right.

44:11.408 --> 44:13.180
Right.

44:42.739 --> 44:44.778
No rope around here.

44:47.844 --> 44:50.484
<i>Maybe there was a store before.</i>

44:54.884 --> 44:57.524
Maybe they made rope here.

44:58.588 --> 45:00.923
There was a factory.

45:01.259 --> 45:05.332
<i>This could have been the center
of the entire Balkan rope industry.</i>

45:06.496 --> 45:08.766
<i>Everybody in the village made rope.</i>

45:08.866 --> 45:12.870
Every year they'd split the surplus
at the rope festival.

45:12.970 --> 45:16.006
<i>People come from all over
the country to celebrate.</i>

45:16.106 --> 45:17.779
<i>Singing, dancing.</i>

45:18.309 --> 45:21.662
At weddings, newlyweds
would give each other rope...

45:21.762 --> 45:24.649
<i>and tie themselves together
as a symbol of their union.</i>

45:24.749 --> 45:26.817
- Who is this guy?
- <i>Offerings were made...</i>

45:26.917 --> 45:30.087
He's part of our... integration program.

45:30.187 --> 45:33.927
<i>There were miracles.
Rope appeared out of nowhere.</i>

45:34.924 --> 45:39.130
<i>Welcome to Konopac,
the rope capital of the world.</i>

45:39.230 --> 45:41.465
<i>Population, 5.</i>

45:41.565 --> 45:44.235
<i>I'm B, I'll be your tour guide
for this afternoon</i>

45:44.335 --> 45:47.808
<i>and I'm pleased to be with y'all
on this lovely day.</i>

45:59.849 --> 46:01.789
No, no, no.

46:02.652 --> 46:05.492
Stay with Sophie, stay with Sophie.

46:10.226 --> 46:15.135
That's the kid's house. He says
there's a big chunk of rope in there.

46:17.901 --> 46:20.338
Shit!
Where d'you get her?

46:20.438 --> 46:22.843
Models without borders?

46:23.340 --> 46:25.810
- Hi, I'm Katya.
- That's Katya.

46:26.110 --> 46:29.146
Ka... Katya? The Katya?
Katya, Katya...

46:29.246 --> 46:30.878
- Yeah.
- What's she doing here?

46:30.978 --> 46:33.254
- Is she here to see you?
- Can't get enough...

46:41.391 --> 46:43.661
Wait, wait.

46:43.811 --> 46:45.550
It's tied up.

46:48.965 --> 46:51.605
Nikola, stop.

46:56.139 --> 46:58.012
Rope.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.915
That's the rope?

47:03.446 --> 47:06.484
- Our rope?
- Nikola no lie.

47:06.584 --> 47:09.687
Nikola no lie, but Nikola no say
the rope was tied to a dog either.

47:09.787 --> 47:12.456
I say I take you to rope
and rope is there.

47:12.556 --> 47:16.564
Kid is right. The rope is there.
And it's perfect.

47:17.627 --> 47:21.132
It's not perfect. Perfect would be
if there was no dog on one end.

47:21.332 --> 47:24.635
Rope is there.
Dog is your problem, not Nikola's.

47:24.735 --> 47:26.604
Nikola little boy.

47:26.704 --> 47:29.039
Nikola little boy.

47:29.139 --> 47:32.777
You come here to help, no?
Now you help.

47:32.877 --> 47:36.798
You heard him, Mambru. It's your turn.
You're the safety expert here.

47:36.898 --> 47:39.640
- Exactly.
- We need the rope.

47:39.740 --> 47:43.587
Thank you, Sophie. I know we need
the rope, but we need our hands too.

47:43.687 --> 47:48.125
- You want the kid to get it?
- Great idea, Katya. Great idea.

47:48.425 --> 47:51.295
Don't we have anything we can give him?

47:51.395 --> 47:54.031
Valium?
Percocet?

47:54.431 --> 47:56.470
I'll check.

47:59.669 --> 48:01.542
Nikola!

48:03.239 --> 48:05.412
Where are you going?

48:07.577 --> 48:09.146
Inside.

48:09.246 --> 48:13.821
You can't go inside.
It's not safe, come on!

48:15.952 --> 48:18.292
I need my ball.

48:25.128 --> 48:27.568
You see the roof?

48:28.131 --> 48:30.571
It's falling.
It's too dangerous.

48:35.171 --> 48:37.742
How about we get the rope...

48:37.842 --> 48:41.979
and then I go inside and get ball?

48:42.079 --> 48:43.451
Okay.

48:44.347 --> 48:46.687
Let's go help Sophie.

48:47.984 --> 48:50.554
- He brought you to his house.
- He said there was rope here.

48:50.654 --> 48:53.190
- There is.
- He said?

48:53.290 --> 48:55.659
I don't understand, who's in charge here?
The kid?

48:55.759 --> 48:58.762
Well, sometimes we get information
from local people.

48:58.862 --> 49:00.965
Local people?

49:01.065 --> 49:02.767
You mean local kids?

49:02.867 --> 49:05.803
Good doggie.
Yeah.

49:05.903 --> 49:07.907
Good doggie.

49:09.006 --> 49:12.646
- Good doggie.
- That should be enough.

49:21.601 --> 49:24.374
- Careful, Damir.
- Don't worry.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.629
Tajsone.

49:32.679 --> 49:34.517
Tajsone.

49:34.764 --> 49:37.101
Tajsone crazy dog.

49:37.201 --> 49:39.937
One day, he bite my father.

49:40.037 --> 49:42.373
But my father more crazy than Tajsone.

49:42.473 --> 49:47.478
He bite Tajsone back and since then
Tajsone respect him.

49:47.578 --> 49:49.480
So your dad... bit the dog?

49:49.580 --> 49:52.049
Everybody to hospital that night.

49:52.149 --> 49:53.918
Dog too.

49:54.018 --> 49:55.486
He says...

49:55.586 --> 49:58.689
"what you do to me I do to you."

49:58.789 --> 50:01.125
And Tajsone never bite him again.

50:01.225 --> 50:03.063
Sure.

50:06.396 --> 50:09.670
Where are they now?
Your mum and your dad?

50:11.367 --> 50:14.738
They afraid something bad
happen to us here.

50:14.838 --> 50:19.315
So they leave me with my grandfather
and they go in Donovich.

50:21.878 --> 50:24.348
But he says they will come back
when war is over.

50:24.448 --> 50:26.520
Sure.

50:27.483 --> 50:29.273
I'm sure.

50:32.488 --> 50:36.463
He's even more awake now
than he was before.

50:37.294 --> 50:39.163
This won't be easy.

50:39.263 --> 50:41.699
He survived the war.

50:42.099 --> 50:43.634
Nikola.

50:43.734 --> 50:46.707
If your ball is in house, where is?

50:47.437 --> 50:50.007
- In garage.
- Garage?

50:50.107 --> 50:52.179
Vámonos, Sophie.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.715
Okay, let me go first.

52:38.815 --> 52:41.254
Stay right behind me.

53:43.746 --> 53:45.819
Boy.

53:56.893 --> 53:58.429
Where is the roof?

53:58.729 --> 54:01.068
Out there somewhere.

54:03.866 --> 54:06.634
They blew it off
from right there, you see?

54:06.870 --> 54:09.773
They leave an open tank of butane...

54:09.873 --> 54:12.176
they light a fuse...

54:12.276 --> 54:14.948
close the windows, shut the door.

54:15.678 --> 54:17.919
Half an hour later...

54:18.982 --> 54:20.587
roof is gone.

54:21.417 --> 54:23.153
Who?

54:23.453 --> 54:25.792
Neighbors, probably.

54:29.592 --> 54:31.428
But before the war

54:31.528 --> 54:34.534
if you were a Muslim
and your husband a Serb...

54:35.031 --> 54:38.916
or the other way around
it was no big deal.

54:42.805 --> 54:45.008
Then the war starts...

54:45.108 --> 54:47.547
the lines are drawn.

54:49.212 --> 54:52.218
And now it's too dangerous to stay here.

54:54.016 --> 54:55.755
So...

54:56.519 --> 54:59.426
you leave the kids
with their grandparents...

55:00.389 --> 55:03.093
and you go to the other side...

55:03.193 --> 55:05.532
where it's safer.

55:08.664 --> 55:12.005
But while you're away...

55:13.936 --> 55:18.224
the neighbors blow up your house
so you won't come back after the war.

55:18.324 --> 55:20.664
Hey, it could be worse.

55:21.644 --> 55:23.046
What could be worse?

55:23.146 --> 55:26.652
Putting a mine in the sofa
in case you do come back.

55:29.685 --> 55:31.925
Let's move.

55:33.122 --> 55:34.962
No.

56:06.789 --> 56:08.761
Mambru?

56:09.258 --> 56:11.161
I got it.

56:11.261 --> 56:13.698
He's gonna be a happy kid.

56:24.541 --> 56:26.476
Wait! Wait!
No!

56:26.576 --> 56:28.045
- Sorry.
- Sophie, don't.

56:28.145 --> 56:30.484
I'm so sorry.

56:34.718 --> 56:36.957
Wait, Sophie.

56:37.954 --> 56:39.890
Don't turn around.

56:39.990 --> 56:42.725
- What?
- Look at me.

56:42.825 --> 56:44.828
Look at me.

56:44.928 --> 56:47.133
Don't turn around.

56:48.064 --> 56:50.033
- It's okay.
- What...

56:50.133 --> 56:52.335
Look at me. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

56:52.435 --> 56:55.108
Come here...
Don't! Don't! Don't!

57:15.158 --> 57:17.127
Nikola.

57:17.227 --> 57:21.050
Here's the ball.
Mambru needs you inside.

57:41.950 --> 57:43.990
Long enough.

57:44.687 --> 57:46.727
Let's do it.

59:04.667 --> 59:06.872
There are soldiers.

59:08.036 --> 59:10.073
<i>Copy that.
Over.</i>

59:10.173 --> 59:12.812
Welcome to the Balkans!

59:17.245 --> 59:20.450
Hotel, Hotel.
This is Mike 1, come in. Over.

59:20.550 --> 59:22.452
<i>Mike 1, this is Hotel, come in.</i>

59:24.286 --> 59:25.822
Hey.

59:25.922 --> 59:29.627
Tell them not to wash the car.
We don't have any money.

59:30.127 --> 59:31.394
They don't wanna wash the car.

59:31.494 --> 59:35.268
I know they don't wanna wash the car.
It's a joke. Tell them.

59:42.004 --> 59:43.877
Tell them.

01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.566
We've been stopped
at a local military checkpoint

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:12.936
on the road to Bjelane about
30 kilometers east, sector 6.

01:00:13.036 --> 01:00:16.273
- What's going on?
- We are 6 people. 4 expats.

01:00:16.373 --> 01:00:20.556
Yeah, yeah. What the hell was that?
Ask them what the problem is.

01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:30.287
He says the road is closed.
We have to go back.

01:00:30.387 --> 01:00:32.191
Why?

01:00:34.823 --> 01:00:38.762
He says... because we can't go through.

01:00:38.862 --> 01:00:41.251
That explains everything.

01:00:42.998 --> 01:00:45.538
<i>The road is closed.</i>

01:00:49.988 --> 01:00:52.174
Johnny Cash?

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.444
<i>Yeah, I think it's something else.</i>

01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:55.979
I'm walking over.

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:59.349
- Can they stop us?
- Looks like it.

01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:03.520
According to the peace agreements, these
guys should have been demobilized by now.

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.622
You wanna go and tell them?

01:01:05.722 --> 01:01:07.224
Fine.

01:01:07.624 --> 01:01:09.529
Hey.

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:17.934
Okay.
Sophie, get behind the wheel.

01:01:18.034 --> 01:01:22.582
If I put my hands like this turn the car
around and get the hell out of here.

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.821
What's the problem?
Why can't we go through?

01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:40.627
Tell him we need to go through.
We have to reach the base.

01:01:42.691 --> 01:01:45.095
- You can't.
- Sorry, madam. This is a war.

01:01:45.195 --> 01:01:49.266
No, this is not. War is over.
There are peace talks underway.

01:01:49.366 --> 01:01:53.072
Cessation of hostilities.
Do you understand?

01:01:56.438 --> 01:01:58.644
You haven't been informed.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.781
Who's your commanding officer?

01:02:05.414 --> 01:02:08.885
- Are those prisoners right behind me?
- Yeah.

01:02:08.985 --> 01:02:13.393
- Do we know what they're doing with them?
- I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.532
Excuse me...

01:02:22.232 --> 01:02:25.802
Can you tell them...
if they need a hand with anything

01:02:25.902 --> 01:02:28.441
we are willing to help?

01:02:39.982 --> 01:02:41.484
What did he say?

01:02:41.584 --> 01:02:45.001
Nothing. He says... we have to go.
The road is closed.

01:02:46.855 --> 01:02:51.261
Okay. Okay.
Ask them what time do they open the road.

01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:53.199
I can't.

01:02:55.764 --> 01:02:58.704
- Why?
- I can't.

01:03:04.473 --> 01:03:08.214
- Why?
- He say that he knows my family in Dabrica.

01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:15.655
- Do you have family in Dabrica?
- My brother.

01:03:17.519 --> 01:03:19.789
Okay.
I'm sorry.

01:03:19.889 --> 01:03:22.341
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:25.681
Okay.
We go.

01:03:51.888 --> 01:03:55.358
<i>We stumbled on to a little situation
on the road to Bjelane.</i>

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:59.696
20 prisoners, blue minibus.
Looks like they're up to no good.

01:03:59.796 --> 01:04:03.633
<i>Inform the blue helmets, tell them to check
it out and make sure everything is kosher.</i>

01:04:03.733 --> 01:04:07.510
<i>Location 30 kilometers east of Dukovo.
Over.</i>

01:04:24.387 --> 01:04:26.626
You know where we are?

01:04:27.556 --> 01:04:29.429
I think so.

01:05:11.034 --> 01:05:13.503
<i>Mike 2, this is Mike 1.
Over.</i>

01:05:13.603 --> 01:05:14.961
Yeah, go ahead.

01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:18.408
<i>Yeah. The road isn't here. We should have
seen it 4 kilometers back. Over.</i>

01:05:18.508 --> 01:05:20.443
That's not good.

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:23.849
<i>Let's keep that hill in the sight.
Over.</i>

01:05:47.035 --> 01:05:48.508
<i>Cow?</i>

01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:51.744
Cow.

01:06:02.718 --> 01:06:04.957
Man!

01:06:10.892 --> 01:06:13.032
That's fresh.

01:06:20.468 --> 01:06:22.338
Fuck me.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:25.942
What do you think?
Go to the left?

01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:28.645
Or right?
Or over it?

01:06:28.745 --> 01:06:31.511
This morning we went over one.
It worked.

01:06:31.611 --> 01:06:33.686
What worked?

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:36.152
They always follow a pattern.

01:06:36.252 --> 01:06:39.388
Maybe the pattern is to change pattern.

01:06:39.488 --> 01:06:43.593
And now it's underneath.
That's what I would do if I were them.

01:06:43.693 --> 01:06:46.573
If you were them, maybe you're thinking
that we know what you're thinking

01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:49.168
and then you'd go on the side.

01:06:50.932 --> 01:06:52.936
It was dragged here.

01:06:53.236 --> 01:06:57.240
- Excuse me?
- The cow. It was dragged from here.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.842
You mean it's from somewhere else?

01:06:59.942 --> 01:07:02.314
Yeah, it was brought here.

01:07:02.944 --> 01:07:06.015
- The cow?
- Yeah, the cow, the cow.

01:07:06.115 --> 01:07:09.118
Okay, B, go ahead
and inform on our position.

01:07:09.218 --> 01:07:11.220
We're gonna have to spend the night here.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.073
- With the cow?
- With the cow.

01:07:14.173 --> 01:07:16.993
- You're kidding me, right?
- You're not going to drive over this one?

01:07:17.093 --> 01:07:20.196
- No, this is a different breed of cow.
- Isn't there another way?

01:07:20.296 --> 01:07:22.496
Also, it is a possibility it could've died?

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.720
Everybody... everybody, listen up!

01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:26.769
We're gonna move the cars back 10 meters

01:07:26.869 --> 01:07:29.906
and nobody strays from the cars
without my permission.

01:07:30.006 --> 01:07:31.808
Nikola, the ball stays in the car.

01:07:31.908 --> 01:07:34.830
We can't stop like this in the middle
of the night. We have to keep going.

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:38.284
I'm already cold!
Can we go back or something and make...

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:45.124
Go, get it.
If you don't blow up, we keep driving.

01:07:48.323 --> 01:07:49.896
Well?

01:07:51.793 --> 01:07:54.133
Come on, get in the car.

01:07:59.301 --> 01:08:01.170
We are in quadrant 3.

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.642
A country road
about 14 kilometers east of Dukovo.

01:08:05.742 --> 01:08:06.909
We are 6 people.

01:08:07.009 --> 01:08:10.980
4 expats and 2 locals,
the interpreter and a boy.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.519
<i>Do you have enough supplies?</i>

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.085
Roger that, Hotel.

01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:19.055
We have enough water, some sardines

01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:22.058
various other NGO tin can delicacies.

01:08:22.158 --> 01:08:24.493
We could really use a pizza, however.

01:08:24.594 --> 01:08:27.700
Do you happen to know of a place
that delivers? Over.

01:08:28.781 --> 01:08:30.867
<i>Can you repeat that?</i>

01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:33.603
I said we have sufficient supplies.
Over.

01:08:33.703 --> 01:08:35.774
<i>Okay, I'll...</i>

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:54.493
How are you doing?

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.232
I can't stop thinking about them.

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:05.738
The 3 of them.
I imagine them together in that house.

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:10.643
Is that normal?

01:09:17.578 --> 01:09:19.417
Forget them.

01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:22.087
They're gone.

01:09:25.886 --> 01:09:29.761
- What are we going to do?
- Nothing.

01:09:30.425 --> 01:09:32.665
We keep going.

01:09:33.728 --> 01:09:35.768
Don't think about it.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.072
You'll end up going home.

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:46.845
Forget what's happened
or what's gonna happen.

01:09:48.376 --> 01:09:50.846
Focus on what's happening now.

01:09:50.947 --> 01:09:52.917
Have some.

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.890
The rest doesn't exist here.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.926
Maybe back home...

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.729
but not here.

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.665
Mambru!

01:10:07.796 --> 01:10:11.838
Your girlfriend called the base!
Apparently it's urgent!

01:10:13.368 --> 01:10:15.805
Mambru, did you hear me?

01:10:16.105 --> 01:10:19.478
- Your girl...
- I heard. I heard.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:25.054
You have to work on it.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.686
Trust me.

01:10:39.127 --> 01:10:42.198
Where do you think you are?
At a barbecue?

01:10:42.298 --> 01:10:46.903
Hotel, this is Mambru.
Did she say why it was urgent? Over.

01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:50.409
<i>Negative. Just to call her.
Over and out.</i>

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:57.180
What's going on, Sarah?

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.585
Yes, she is.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.987
What a coincidence?

01:11:04.287 --> 01:11:07.023
Yeah, she told me
you guys ran into each other.

01:11:07.123 --> 01:11:09.362
So what's going on?

01:11:13.528 --> 01:11:15.334
Whichever.

01:11:16.131 --> 01:11:18.571
I mean, does it matter?

01:11:19.367 --> 01:11:21.407
Either one.

01:11:22.237 --> 01:11:24.310
The second one.

01:11:25.173 --> 01:11:26.979
Salmon.

01:11:27.976 --> 01:11:32.114
No, it's not that I don't care.
I totally do.

01:11:32.214 --> 01:11:35.500
I trust you, which is different.

01:11:39.187 --> 01:11:41.627
Where is Damir's coffee?

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.764
Thank you.

01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:53.638
What about his parents?
Won't they be worried?

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:55.504
They won't be worried.

01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:58.507
Well, he's just a kid
and you're keeping him all night.

01:11:58.607 --> 01:12:01.811
He lives in Bjelani with his grandfather.
He says it's no problem...

01:12:01.911 --> 01:12:04.533
What he said doesn't matter.
He's a minor.

01:12:06.081 --> 01:12:08.851
What would you say if he were your son?

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:12.255
Some people take him
and bring him back the next day.

01:12:12.355 --> 01:12:16.343
Well?
What would any normal person think?

01:12:16.443 --> 01:12:19.495
That there was a problem
at the checkpoint?

01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:22.167
I said normal, B, you don't count.

01:12:23.081 --> 01:12:25.564
B, did you know that Katya
came all the way here

01:12:25.664 --> 01:12:28.170
to close the mission and send us home?

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:32.444
- What home?
- Exactly. What home?

01:12:32.774 --> 01:12:34.911
That's the problem.

01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:37.813
A home, B.
Normal with walls.

01:12:37.913 --> 01:12:40.583
That isn't bombed out.
Have you got one of those?

01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:43.352
Wife, children, friends.

01:12:43.452 --> 01:12:46.122
A dog.
Someone waiting for you somewhere?

01:12:46.222 --> 01:12:48.024
Yeah, I got plenty of people
waiting for me.

01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:50.896
Plenty.
How many?

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.996
Hookers don't count.

01:12:54.096 --> 01:12:56.832
- Hookers don't count?
- No, they don't.

01:12:56.932 --> 01:12:59.235
I mean, emotional bonds.

01:12:59.335 --> 01:13:01.270
Have you got any?

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.842
Emotional bonds.

01:13:07.909 --> 01:13:09.645
I'll have to think about it.

01:13:09.745 --> 01:13:13.716
You guys spend so much time around here
you forget what real life is like.

01:13:13.816 --> 01:13:16.719
Look, I don't wanna kick you out of here.

01:13:16.819 --> 01:13:18.754
I just wanna do my job.

01:13:18.854 --> 01:13:23.116
For that, I have to get to the base.
Is that too much to ask?

01:13:25.093 --> 01:13:27.430
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.902
What did I say?
Nobody strays.

01:13:46.549 --> 01:13:49.756
Damir, what are you looking at?

01:13:50.086 --> 01:13:52.375
Show some respect for your colleagues.

01:14:08.603 --> 01:14:11.310
Internal affairs is moving.

01:14:12.407 --> 01:14:14.343
You noticed, right?

01:14:14.443 --> 01:14:17.612
- What?
- Her panties.

01:14:17.712 --> 01:14:20.786
- They were black.
- So?

01:14:21.116 --> 01:14:26.255
So nobody wears black panties to a war
unless they're expecting something.

01:14:26.355 --> 01:14:28.824
Where did you hear that?

01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:31.961
You gotta bang her.
It's no big deal.

01:14:32.061 --> 01:14:34.730
She'll soften up a bit,
she writes a favorable report

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.366
and everybody be happy.
Sophie agrees.

01:14:37.466 --> 01:14:40.603
- You two talked about it?
- We don't even need to.

01:14:40.703 --> 01:14:44.073
We understand each other without talking.
It's non-verbal communication.

01:14:44.173 --> 01:14:46.133
This morning your communication
was pretty verbal.

01:14:46.225 --> 01:14:48.436
We're pass that.

01:14:50.745 --> 01:14:54.592
And I have been tilling the soil for you.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:58.186
- What soil?
- With Katya.

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.356
I told her that, you know...

01:15:00.456 --> 01:15:04.093
from time to time, you... talk about her...

01:15:04.193 --> 01:15:06.471
all affectionate.

01:15:08.563 --> 01:15:12.101
- That's not true.
- I know it's not true. It's a trick.

01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:14.570
We want her happy.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:18.974
Can't you just slip her one?
It's not like I'm asking you to fuck Damir.

01:15:19.074 --> 01:15:20.844
B...

01:15:21.544 --> 01:15:23.958
I have a girlfriend.

01:15:25.046 --> 01:15:27.049
- Yeah.
- She's hot.

01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:30.653
You had a thing with her before.
It's a relapse.

01:15:30.753 --> 01:15:33.756
It's like smoking again.
It's totally understandable.

01:15:33.856 --> 01:15:36.895
She writes a terrible report about us...

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.362
we gotta go home.
What then?

01:15:40.462 --> 01:15:43.099
Who helps the people then?

01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:47.036
You even think about that?
No. You're being selfish.

01:15:47.136 --> 01:15:51.282
You gotta fuck her...
for the Bosnian people!

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:57.021
Make a sacrifice...
for the humanitarian cause.

01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:00.748
She won't say no.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:03.694
Hey.
Hey.

01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:06.097
I'm serious.

01:16:38.019 --> 01:16:40.298
Did he fall asleep?

01:16:42.924 --> 01:16:45.494
He says when he grows up,
he wants to be an aid worker.

01:16:45.594 --> 01:16:49.932
Tell him how much we make
he'll change his mind real fast.

01:16:50.032 --> 01:16:53.469
Pay no attention. He'll tell the soldiers
he wants to be a soldier.

01:16:53.569 --> 01:16:55.437
These journalists,
he wants to be a journalist.

01:16:55.537 --> 01:16:58.374
Have you guys seen my notebook
or did you throw that away too, Mambru?

01:16:58.474 --> 01:17:00.888
He would tell Katya
he wants to... hey, Katya...

01:17:00.988 --> 01:17:03.632
What is it that you do now exactly, Katya?

01:17:04.045 --> 01:17:07.349
Conflict evaluation and analysis.

01:17:07.449 --> 01:17:10.219
Forget that. He don't wanna tell
anyone he wants to do that.

01:17:10.319 --> 01:17:12.797
I don't even know what that is.

01:17:14.389 --> 01:17:17.893
Is he hitting on you? Watch out.
He always hits on the new ones.

01:17:17.993 --> 01:17:20.996
I know that.
We all do.

01:17:21.196 --> 01:17:22.364
You all know what?

01:17:22.464 --> 01:17:25.668
That you always do that.
They warn us.

01:17:25.768 --> 01:17:28.905
- Was it in your mission briefing?
- Under potential hazards.

01:17:29.005 --> 01:17:33.342
- Along with mines and drunken soldiers?
- Right above it.

01:17:33.442 --> 01:17:35.920
You should read them.

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:39.106
I will now.

01:17:43.184 --> 01:17:45.563
That's me a few years ago.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.558
Does she have a boyfriend?

01:17:49.658 --> 01:17:51.293
I don't know.

01:17:51.393 --> 01:17:55.006
No, of course not.
How convenient.

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:59.377
Ask her. Maybe she's got
a photo of him in her wallet.

01:18:01.436 --> 01:18:03.372
Have you got one of Sarah's?

01:18:03.472 --> 01:18:07.184
- What do you care?
- You didn't before.

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:09.921
How do you know?

01:18:10.945 --> 01:18:13.941
- You didn't.
- Did you look in my wallet?

01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:17.688
That's not the point right now.
The point is whether or not you had one.

01:18:17.788 --> 01:18:21.789
- And you didn't.
- Did you look in my wallet?

01:18:21.889 --> 01:18:24.860
So what if I did?
I was looking for something else.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.721
- Like what?
- Your passport. I don't remember.

01:18:27.821 --> 01:18:31.300
Unbelievable.
You looked in my wallet.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.535
You hid that you had a girlfriend from me.

01:18:33.635 --> 01:18:36.947
I never hid anything from you.

01:18:38.306 --> 01:18:42.244
It just never came up.
I never said I didn't have a girlfriend.

01:18:42.344 --> 01:18:45.140
- I talked to you about my boyfriend.
- Non-stop.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.860
- I left him for you.
- Nobody asked you to.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.755
Did I ask you to leave him?

01:18:52.855 --> 01:18:54.932
Did I?

01:18:56.657 --> 01:19:00.195
What's wrong with men?
You know, it's normal.

01:19:00.295 --> 01:19:04.175
You talk about your girlfriend.
You carry her photo in your wallet.

01:19:04.799 --> 01:19:07.603
What are you so ashamed of?
Is it that hard to just admit it?

01:19:07.703 --> 01:19:10.172
Okay!
I have a girlfriend!

01:19:10.272 --> 01:19:13.150
Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

01:19:13.658 --> 01:19:15.136
Here.

01:19:18.479 --> 01:19:21.174
Here is a picture of my girlfriend.

01:19:26.037 --> 01:19:28.625
Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

01:19:33.094 --> 01:19:34.972
Here.

01:19:36.797 --> 01:19:38.834
Go ahead and tell the world
I have a girlfriend.

01:19:38.934 --> 01:19:41.437
Who wants to see
a picture of my girlfriend?

01:19:41.537 --> 01:19:44.640
- Is she naked?
- No, she's not naked.

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.609
Normal people don't carry
naked photos of their girlfriend.

01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:49.920
Damir does.

01:19:50.044 --> 01:19:53.792
- You looked in my wallet?
- I was looking for your passport.

01:19:58.786 --> 01:20:01.432
Can't see her very well.
It's blurry.

01:20:02.056 --> 01:20:04.593
You can see her just fine.

01:20:04.693 --> 01:20:08.880
What? You want me
to carry around a poster of her?

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:13.044
You tricked me, Mambru and I believed you.

01:20:19.173 --> 01:20:21.902
It wouldn't have made any difference.

01:20:23.544 --> 01:20:26.214
You think I lied to you...

01:20:26.314 --> 01:20:28.592
but I didn't.

01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:31.795
Here.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.939
It was nobody's fault.

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:47.211
Our relationship... had a blind spot.

01:20:47.768 --> 01:20:49.738
Yeah, like a car.

01:20:49.838 --> 01:20:52.241
Something we couldn't see, that's all.

01:20:52.341 --> 01:20:54.460
You mean... your wife?

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.784
- Don't call my wife a blind spot.
- I didn't, you did.

01:20:57.884 --> 01:21:00.148
I didn't mean her.
I was just giving an example.

01:21:00.248 --> 01:21:04.039
Besides she's not my wife.
We're not married.

01:21:04.139 --> 01:21:05.908
See?
You're denying here again.

01:21:06.008 --> 01:21:10.161
Please, can you guys go somewhere else?
I'm trying to go to sleep here.

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:16.932
No, we can't!

01:21:17.032 --> 01:21:19.510
There are mines!

01:21:57.472 --> 01:22:01.252
What? What? What?
What? What the fuck?

01:22:03.895 --> 01:22:07.892
- My God. Jesus.
- Shit, you scared me.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:11.028
Mambru, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:15.532
<i>Mambru, follow the granny.</i>

01:22:16.123 --> 01:22:19.865
<i>Follow the granny.
Trust me, follow the granny.</i>

01:22:19.965 --> 01:22:22.597
10-4, B.
10-4.

01:22:22.697 --> 01:22:24.976
It's just a cow.

01:22:27.102 --> 01:22:28.950
My God, I'm sorry.

01:22:43.618 --> 01:22:45.850
Not too close, not too close.

01:22:53.996 --> 01:22:55.507
Okay.

01:23:05.307 --> 01:23:07.009
Just don't look.

01:23:07.109 --> 01:23:08.969
Don't look.

01:23:28.664 --> 01:23:31.476
<i>I was right.
It was left!</i>

01:24:17.912 --> 01:24:19.724
It's my grandfather.

01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:25.996
B, tell Damir to get over here.

01:24:46.974 --> 01:24:49.344
<i>Oprostite.</i>
Excuse me.

01:24:49.444 --> 01:24:51.580
It's our fault.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.761
Tell him the road was closed.

01:24:55.317 --> 01:24:57.924
We couldn't make it back last night.

01:24:58.352 --> 01:25:00.531
And Nikola behaved very well.

01:25:06.628 --> 01:25:10.741
Tell him... that Nikola took us
to his house in Dukovo.

01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:24.471
He asks if boy went into the house.

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.776
No, he didn't.
I did.

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.803
Nikola.

01:25:55.342 --> 01:25:58.789
Ask him if he knows
what happened to his parents.

01:26:08.022 --> 01:26:10.100
He knows.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.839
When he will tell him?

01:26:18.933 --> 01:26:21.178
When war stops.

01:26:22.603 --> 01:26:24.981
When time comes.

01:26:54.435 --> 01:26:57.581
Let's go, let's go.
Let's free some space here.

01:26:58.523 --> 01:27:00.501
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's go.

01:27:13.654 --> 01:27:16.132
Make sure you send a postcard.

01:27:19.226 --> 01:27:21.638
Yeah.

01:27:22.496 --> 01:27:24.132
Here we are.

01:27:24.232 --> 01:27:26.802
The war plumbers.

01:27:26.902 --> 01:27:29.337
Unclogging pipes.

01:27:29.437 --> 01:27:33.074
You know, maybe I should be
moving along somewhere.

01:27:33.174 --> 01:27:36.244
Maybe Katya was right.
I should find a wife

01:27:36.344 --> 01:27:38.647
and have two and a half kids.

01:27:38.747 --> 01:27:41.317
- Settle down.
- Fuck all that.

01:27:42.217 --> 01:27:45.394
This is your home.
I mean...

01:27:45.754 --> 01:27:49.790
or wherever, people need your help, B.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.094
That's your family.

01:27:52.194 --> 01:27:54.663
The family that waits for you.

01:27:55.163 --> 01:27:57.199
Misses you.

01:27:57.299 --> 01:28:00.102
How many people can say...

01:28:00.202 --> 01:28:03.839
they are missed by people
they've never met before?

01:28:04.339 --> 01:28:06.040
Not many.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.919
Not many.

01:28:15.349 --> 01:28:17.252
Okay.

01:28:17.352 --> 01:28:20.397
- Pull.
- Slowly.

01:28:35.514 --> 01:28:37.581
Come on up, Romeo.

01:28:53.072 --> 01:28:56.216
What?
Sophie!

01:28:57.908 --> 01:28:59.567
Sophie!

01:29:02.096 --> 01:29:04.308
What's going on?

01:29:34.093 --> 01:29:35.897
What's the problem?

01:29:35.997 --> 01:29:38.400
Are you in charge here?

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.734
Yes, I am.

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:44.672
Yeah, I have a request
from... Ri... Richa... Richardson?

01:29:44.772 --> 01:29:47.542
- It's Richard.
- Yes. Sophie Richard.

01:29:47.642 --> 01:29:52.881
It says, "inspection request...
explosives."

01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:55.650
You must abandon the extraction
of that corpse immediately.

01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:58.829
- It could be mined.
- But it's not.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.632
- May I?
- Sure.

01:30:03.824 --> 01:30:05.927
That's a mistake.

01:30:06.027 --> 01:30:08.129
We've searched that well inside out.

01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:10.965
There are no explosives in there.
It's all clear.

01:30:11.065 --> 01:30:14.302
Well, you may not be aware of it, sir,
but this is a red zone.

01:30:14.402 --> 01:30:16.371
There's been some changes of jurisdiction

01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:19.407
and we handed everything over
to the local authorities.

01:30:19.507 --> 01:30:22.568
So mined or not,
removing that dead body is illegal.

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:26.181
- I can't believe this.
- But it's a basic sanitary service.

01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:29.351
I mean, with all due respect, sir,
it wouldn't matter if it were a pig.

01:30:29.451 --> 01:30:33.154
Abandon the extraction immediately. You need
a judge present to do what you're doing.

01:30:33.254 --> 01:30:35.590
- A judge?
- Yes, a judge.

01:30:35.690 --> 01:30:39.594
The area is now under civil jurisdiction.
It's all here in the peace agreements.

01:30:39.694 --> 01:30:42.897
- We must all respect procedure.
- Where the hell are we gonna find a judge?

01:30:42.997 --> 01:30:47.665
We will provide a judge. Just notify
the local authorities. Respect protocol.

01:30:47.765 --> 01:30:49.904
It's not your responsibility
to solve everything.

01:30:50.004 --> 01:30:52.407
Can't you make an exception?
The people here need water.

01:30:52.507 --> 01:30:55.266
Just abandon the extraction
from my request. Let us do our job.

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:59.214
- You might be generating a conflict.
- But there already is a conflict here.

01:30:59.314 --> 01:31:03.351
If we do not clean the water, we won't
need 1 judge we'll need 20 judges.

01:31:03.451 --> 01:31:05.053
We cannot make any exceptions, ma'am.

01:31:05.153 --> 01:31:06.821
It's all written in the peace agreements

01:31:06.921 --> 01:31:09.958
and it must be respected
by all parties in conflict.

01:31:10.058 --> 01:31:13.837
It's very simple.
You cannot touch dead bodies.

01:31:30.244 --> 01:31:33.648
Give me that rope.
That's our rope.

01:31:33.748 --> 01:31:36.960
Give it to me!
Don't take it.

01:31:37.751 --> 01:31:41.489
You do nothing here!
United nothing! You're nothing!

01:31:41.589 --> 01:31:45.026
I understand your reasoning
but there's nothing else we can do.

01:31:45.326 --> 01:31:47.929
We understand that your work
is very important here.

01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:50.465
Remember, we are on the same side.

01:31:50.565 --> 01:31:52.923
Stay out of trouble.

01:32:18.392 --> 01:32:20.403
I'm sorry.

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:10.620
Excuse me!

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:13.658
Excuse me.

01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:16.764
Excuse me.

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:19.429
May I see the ball?

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:25.368
Is that the ball?

01:33:25.792 --> 01:33:28.163
Let me see the ball.
Let me see...

01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:38.515
What's he doing?

01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:42.243
No, I just wanna see the ball.

01:33:42.343 --> 01:33:44.821
No, no, no, no.

01:33:52.716 --> 01:33:54.426
This is not your ball!

01:34:05.332 --> 01:34:07.611
Get out of my face!

01:34:11.305 --> 01:34:15.758
He says...
Nikola sold it to them for $10.

01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:22.717
Bullshit.

01:34:22.817 --> 01:34:24.661
Bullshit.

01:34:29.589 --> 01:34:32.958
Hey, Nikola!
Did you sell the ball?

01:34:35.662 --> 01:34:37.541
Yeah?

01:35:16.703 --> 01:35:18.939
Does it hurt?

01:35:19.439 --> 01:35:21.284
Nope.

01:35:28.448 --> 01:35:30.827
I thought you wanted that ball.

01:35:32.385 --> 01:35:34.597
I need money.

01:35:35.622 --> 01:35:37.458
What for?

01:35:37.558 --> 01:35:40.837
To go and see my parents in Donovich.

01:35:44.564 --> 01:35:46.534
I have a friend.

01:35:46.634 --> 01:35:49.404
I pay, he takes me where they are.

01:35:49.704 --> 01:35:53.283
I have $40, only need 10 more.

01:35:56.176 --> 01:35:58.112
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

01:35:58.212 --> 01:36:01.304
He has brother at checkpoint.
You pay, you go.

01:36:01.404 --> 01:36:04.218
You can't.
It's too dangerous.

01:36:04.318 --> 01:36:07.998
Not dangerous.
You pay, all is possible here.

01:36:09.656 --> 01:36:12.035
You can't do that.

01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:49.706
Here's a $100.

01:36:51.831 --> 01:36:56.449
On one condition.
You take your grandfather on this trip.

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.747
Now put it in your pocket.

01:37:05.847 --> 01:37:08.125
Put it in your pocket.

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:24.634
Fat fucker.

01:37:40.513 --> 01:37:44.360
<i>Mike 1, Mike 1. Hotel here.
Come in, please.</i>

01:37:45.685 --> 01:37:48.256
<i>This is Mike 1, come in.
Over.</i>

01:37:48.356 --> 01:37:52.393
<i>We have a problem, Mambru,
in Karaula at the refugee camp.</i>

01:37:52.493 --> 01:37:56.743
<i>The latrines are flooded,
somebody should go check it out. Over.</i>

01:37:59.933 --> 01:38:02.437
Should we go straight there?
Over.

01:38:02.537 --> 01:38:06.307
<i>I think you'd better.
There are 8,000 refugees there.</i>

01:38:06.407 --> 01:38:09.519
<i>That's a lot of latrines.
Over.</i>

01:38:09.976 --> 01:38:13.257
Okay, we're on our way.
Over and out.

01:38:18.652 --> 01:38:20.154
I'm sorry.

01:38:20.954 --> 01:38:22.957
No problem.

01:38:23.057 --> 01:38:26.873
I'm curious to see if you guys
actually fix something here.

01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:34.395
<i>That camp was built in a big hurry.
They got the drainage wrong there.</i>

01:38:34.735 --> 01:38:37.572
The ditches must have collapsed
and all the waste overflows

01:38:37.672 --> 01:38:40.908
<i>so we're probably looking
at a swimming pool of shit.</i>

01:38:41.008 --> 01:38:45.145
<i>That'll make the well
look like a mountain spring.</i>

01:38:45.245 --> 01:38:47.415
- A perfect day.
- Yeah.

01:38:47.515 --> 01:38:50.384
Hey, your first flooded latrines
are important too, Sophie.

01:38:50.484 --> 01:38:52.962
You never forget them either.

01:38:56.122 --> 01:38:59.525
- Is it gonna be rough?
- <i>Nah, we'll be fine...</i>

01:38:59.625 --> 01:39:02.237
...as long as it doesn't rain.
