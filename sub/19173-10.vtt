00:15.984 --> 00:18.640
So, let us assume that
the measuring of you

00:18.673 --> 00:20.838
and your proposal are done...

00:20.897 --> 00:22.481
and that we are partners...

00:22.522 --> 00:26.481
in a venture to acquire
and reform Nassau.

00:26.564 --> 00:28.023
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.

00:28.106 --> 00:29.992
Chances are good you've
seen the last of him.

00:30.017 --> 00:32.439
When Anne was recruiting
spies in Port Royal,

00:32.481 --> 00:34.750
she met a man with an
estate in the wilderness.

00:34.775 --> 00:39.023
This man found it profitable to
offer his services to wealthy families

00:39.048 --> 00:41.881
with a need to make troublesome
family members disappear.

00:42.189 --> 00:43.856
What families?

00:43.939 --> 00:45.814
Flint doesn't need to get far.

00:45.839 --> 00:49.140
All he needs is to bury that gold
somewhere unknown and he's won.

00:49.165 --> 00:52.234
Accept the treaty and John Silver lives.

00:52.259 --> 00:55.550
This war, it will not be
bargained away to avoid a fight.

00:55.575 --> 00:56.794
Even if you could kill me,

00:56.819 --> 00:58.316
how are you going to explain it to her?

00:58.340 --> 00:59.706
She believes in this.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.703
If it costs a war to save her,
you'll have lost her anyway.

01:02.735 --> 01:05.986
Even you cannot construct a story
to make her forgive you that.

01:06.069 --> 01:09.278
Is this war more
important than her life?

01:11.670 --> 01:13.795
Answer the question.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.162
I wanna hear you say it.

01:21.372 --> 01:25.705
What's to be done
with the unwanted ones?

01:27.322 --> 01:29.715
The men who do not fit,

01:30.079 --> 01:33.621
whom civilization must
prune from the vine

01:33.704 --> 01:36.856
to protect its sense of itself.

01:36.996 --> 01:40.996
Every culture since earliest
antiquity has survived this way,

01:41.071 --> 01:45.082
defining itself by
the things it excludes.

01:45.621 --> 01:48.038
So long as there is progress,

01:48.121 --> 01:50.706
there will always be
human debris in its wake,

01:50.731 --> 01:53.370
on the outside looking in.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.721
And sooner or later,

01:55.746 --> 01:59.038
one must answer the question...

01:59.121 --> 02:01.723
what becomes of them?

02:03.020 --> 02:04.518
In London,

02:04.543 --> 02:07.370
the solution is to call them criminals.

02:07.371 --> 02:10.163
To throw them in a deep, dark hole

02:10.187 --> 02:12.396
and hope it never runs over.

02:16.095 --> 02:20.163
I would argue that justice
demands we do better than that.

02:20.246 --> 02:24.767
That a civilization is
judged not by who it excludes,

02:24.840 --> 02:28.507
but by how it treats the excluded.

02:31.288 --> 02:33.871
That is not what I asked.

02:43.767 --> 02:47.621
Many of the men incarcerated
here have enemies, sir.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.330
Such is the nature of being
anathema to the empire.

02:51.549 --> 02:53.330
And the only way I can protect them

02:53.371 --> 02:55.996
is to ensure that once they
walk through these gates,

02:56.079 --> 02:59.370
their anonymity is protected, too.

02:59.689 --> 03:03.371
Here, they must cease to
be... to be able to find peace.

03:03.412 --> 03:07.996
I already said I'm not an enemy
of his, nor is the man who sent me.

03:08.079 --> 03:10.362
Yes, and I believe you when
you say it. But still...

03:10.387 --> 03:11.978
Do you know where I come from, sir?

03:12.038 --> 03:15.121
- No, I don't.
- I come from Nassau.

03:20.956 --> 03:24.456
My name is Tom Morgan.

03:27.204 --> 03:30.621
I come on behalf of Long John Silver.

03:35.172 --> 03:36.962
Have you heard of him?

03:38.371 --> 03:40.001
Yes, of course.

03:41.558 --> 03:43.058
Good.

03:44.556 --> 03:48.767
Then I ask you again
and for the last time,

03:49.038 --> 03:52.056
is the prisoner we
are looking for here...

03:52.081 --> 03:53.965
or isn't he?

05:17.366 --> 05:21.202

05:33.184 --> 05:34.517
Come on!

05:34.787 --> 05:35.787
Come on!

05:41.038 --> 05:42.354
Ready, set.

05:43.382 --> 05:44.797
Come up.

05:44.822 --> 05:47.330
Quick! Get to cover!

05:48.660 --> 05:49.811
Get on the beach!

05:54.055 --> 05:57.775
When we make our landing, pass
word to the men I need Flint alive.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.621
If he departed with the money, he's
the one who knows its whereabouts.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.588
What of the others, my Lord?

06:05.704 --> 06:07.549
There are no others.

06:08.338 --> 06:10.537
No quarter, Mr. Utley.

06:13.275 --> 06:15.900
Come on, run! Go!

06:18.787 --> 06:20.060
Get to cover!

06:25.568 --> 06:26.935
Give me your hand!

06:30.495 --> 06:32.038
Give me your hand!

06:51.599 --> 06:53.829
- Ready to starboard!
- Starboard!

06:53.998 --> 06:55.957
Bring her about!

06:56.288 --> 06:57.871
Back to the ship!

07:28.792 --> 07:30.590
Jesus.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.559
Yeah.

07:39.038 --> 07:41.399
Make ready to take on survivors.

07:46.603 --> 07:48.121
An hour ago,

07:48.146 --> 07:51.960
we were upon a fool's errand
to capture Captain Flint

07:51.985 --> 07:55.265
and find an island
that does not exist...

07:55.290 --> 07:57.704
you're welcome for that, by the way...

07:57.962 --> 08:00.204
evade a ship full of redcoats,

08:00.288 --> 08:02.038
fight through a ship full of pirates,

08:02.063 --> 08:05.313
and somehow get past Long John Silver.

08:07.547 --> 08:09.508
I don't know if you've noticed,

08:09.533 --> 08:11.408
but this is considerably better luck

08:11.433 --> 08:13.882
than you and I have experienced lately.

08:13.907 --> 08:15.721
And yet somehow, I get the sense

08:15.746 --> 08:18.038
you and I are possessed
of different instincts

08:18.063 --> 08:20.204
as to how to react to this.

08:20.371 --> 08:21.954
How would you like to react to it?

08:21.979 --> 08:24.387
Throw him in a sack,
sail away from here,

08:24.412 --> 08:27.370
let the Guthrie woman and her
lawyers deal with the governor,

08:27.371 --> 08:29.371
and be alive come tomorrow.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.892
He's headed for open water.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.845
I noticed.

08:41.543 --> 08:43.833
He has everything he came for?

08:46.952 --> 08:48.579
We were at the camp.

08:48.967 --> 08:52.038
They told me you brought the
cache to ransom for her life.

08:52.121 --> 08:53.974
It's in the ground.

08:54.021 --> 08:55.327
Ashore.

08:56.070 --> 08:58.225
I'm the only one who knows where.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.527
It comes out when Madi is safe,

09:01.552 --> 09:05.169
when the governor is dead or captured,

09:05.194 --> 09:07.775
and when we are ready to
return together to the camp

09:07.800 --> 09:10.470
to resume the war to which
we all committed ourselves.

09:10.495 --> 09:13.302
Then and only then.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.980
Can you live with that?

09:21.371 --> 09:23.677
She runs or she wants
room to fight this out?

09:25.746 --> 09:28.662
You've met the man. What do you think?

09:29.513 --> 09:32.974
He'll never stop until we're
all hanging in his square.

09:33.482 --> 09:37.107
Unless we defeat him today, together.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.490
Get us underway and ready the guns.

09:43.515 --> 09:46.079
- Make ready the guns!
- We should speak.

09:46.209 --> 09:47.841
The three of us.

10:01.879 --> 10:03.555
Woodes Rogers isn't
going to receive a letter

10:03.579 --> 10:05.746
from anyone's lawyer
informing him I've beaten him.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.315
I'm going to tell him so.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.954
- Jack...
- I want my money back.

10:09.038 --> 10:10.805
If it takes rescuing the girl
to get Flint to dig it up,

10:10.829 --> 10:13.222
then, Augustus, you and I are
in the rescuing business today.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.840
Get us after that ship.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.566
Well, here I am. What
exactly is on the agenda?

10:36.591 --> 10:38.346
Where did you go?

10:42.597 --> 10:44.597
You were to follow us to the camp.

10:46.037 --> 10:47.346
Your ship disappears...

10:47.371 --> 10:50.013
and then you arrive here as
though none of it happened.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.911
Before we discuss anything else,
I wanna know where you went.

10:58.996 --> 11:00.864
I went to Philadelphia...

11:01.055 --> 11:03.055
to see Joseph Guthrie.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.302
You went to see Joseph Guthrie?

11:07.630 --> 11:10.974
I presented him with a
plan to join our cause.

11:11.246 --> 11:15.121
Every rebellion can use a wealthy
convert or two early in the game.

11:15.414 --> 11:17.123
What did he say?

11:17.261 --> 11:19.636
He politely passed.

11:21.825 --> 11:25.186
Anne remained to be
tended to in the city.

11:25.211 --> 11:26.778
Max with her.

11:27.913 --> 11:29.204
Now that we're all caught up,

11:29.288 --> 11:32.489
might we agree there are
more pressing issues at hand?

11:32.660 --> 11:35.076
Namely, what we intend to do from here.

11:36.371 --> 11:39.638
I intend to assume command here,

11:40.020 --> 11:42.913
pursue the governor, and
capture his ship whole.

11:43.247 --> 11:44.596
Is that so?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.519
We'll need to take her without
the use of our great guns.

11:47.544 --> 11:50.204
It will be technically
beyond your capacities.

11:50.279 --> 11:52.982
Without the guns? Why would you...

11:53.007 --> 11:55.560
It would put Madi's
life at greater risk.

11:55.708 --> 11:59.638
Securing her alive is
all that matters today.

12:00.591 --> 12:02.925
Return her, him,

12:02.950 --> 12:05.831
and the cache back to the camp intact

12:05.856 --> 12:08.370
along with the governor
defeated and in chains.

12:08.371 --> 12:11.288
And news of it will travel far and wide.

12:11.895 --> 12:14.349
The war will be fully,

12:14.433 --> 12:18.016
undeniably, and maybe
unstoppably underway.

12:19.234 --> 12:21.628
Victory here today changes everything

12:21.653 --> 12:23.246
for everyone forever.

12:23.271 --> 12:27.489
And it is most likely to
happen under my direction.

12:31.825 --> 12:34.028
Do you have anything to say about this?

12:39.527 --> 12:41.277
He's right.

12:45.370 --> 12:46.995
And you know it.

12:55.092 --> 12:56.539
You people.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.928
We need to watch him.

13:24.121 --> 13:26.705
The governor is the danger ahead of us.

13:27.495 --> 13:28.913
But if he has a chance

13:28.996 --> 13:30.997
to put knives in our backs
for the money, he'll do it.

13:31.021 --> 13:32.736
You don't think I know that?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.929
What the hell is this?

13:39.577 --> 13:41.746
You cannot honestly
believe that placating me

13:41.829 --> 13:44.370
is going to repair
what's been broken here.

13:44.371 --> 13:48.330
I absolutely think
that it is repairable.

13:48.476 --> 13:50.288
And no one is placating anyone.

13:50.313 --> 13:52.064
Then what exactly is it
you think you're doing here?

13:52.088 --> 13:54.047
I know what it's like...

13:56.593 --> 13:58.765
to have lost her.

13:59.446 --> 14:04.257
And then seeing a way to have her back.

14:06.163 --> 14:09.490
I understand what
that must've felt like.

14:13.913 --> 14:17.371
You asked me once what I would do,

14:17.454 --> 14:19.871
what I would sacrifice

14:19.896 --> 14:22.826
if it meant having Thomas back again.

14:27.954 --> 14:32.787
I honestly don't know...
what I would've done.

14:33.059 --> 14:37.592
I honestly couldn't say I
wouldn't have done what you did.

14:42.496 --> 14:45.246
I told you I'd see you through this.

14:46.954 --> 14:50.397
Put things back together again
so that we can move forward.

14:53.079 --> 14:54.518
I meant it.

15:36.954 --> 15:38.404
Please know...

15:40.691 --> 15:43.935
I was so conflicted about
all this when it began.

15:47.654 --> 15:50.372
I knew it would be
difficult to separate them...

15:51.260 --> 15:52.862
Flint and Silver.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.746
They'd grown so close, it was
hard to know where one ended

15:56.829 --> 15:58.432
and the other began.

16:04.330 --> 16:07.534
I worried that the act of separating
them might destroy them both...

16:08.454 --> 16:12.612
when what I wanted was to remove Flint.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.479
And I saw no other way.

16:21.621 --> 16:25.837
But the things I've done
in the pursuit of it...

16:29.330 --> 16:31.939
were intended to honor my oath.

16:33.829 --> 16:36.322
But somehow, here I am now.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.222
What I've just done...

16:46.671 --> 16:48.688
there's no coming back from that.

16:57.116 --> 17:01.097
There is no difference
between Flint and Silver now.

17:01.996 --> 17:03.370
Or between Flint and any of them.

17:03.371 --> 17:05.714
They are all enemies of mine.

17:08.371 --> 17:12.964
Now, I believe they
are outmatched today.

17:13.537 --> 17:14.762
I believe at the end of the day,

17:14.787 --> 17:17.244
there will be no more
of them left alive.

17:21.163 --> 17:22.815
But if somehow...

17:23.704 --> 17:26.440
they are able to prevail
today against us...

17:27.696 --> 17:29.971
fight their way through
the British soldiers above,

17:29.996 --> 17:32.096
through the governor, through me...

17:33.371 --> 17:36.079
I will ensure that at the end of it all,

17:36.163 --> 17:37.913
when they walk through this final door,

17:37.996 --> 17:39.370
there is defeat awaiting them.

17:39.371 --> 17:43.706
You think killing me
means defeat for them?

17:46.769 --> 17:49.673
You will have given them
a martyr to unite them.

18:39.371 --> 18:41.404
Still no sign of her.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.578
Thought he'd try to block us in ahead.

18:45.836 --> 18:47.584
He's out there.

18:48.871 --> 18:52.748
Maybe there, ready to loose his
guns once we clear the mouth.

18:54.621 --> 18:57.370
We should veer to starboard
as far as is possible

18:57.371 --> 19:00.185
and be prepared to take fire when we do.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.607
The captain suggests Eurydice

19:23.632 --> 19:26.255
is likely lying in wait
beyond that headland.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.372
We should take measures
to prepare for it.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.370
In the meantime,

19:33.527 --> 19:36.851
why don't you tell me what the
fuck you're actually doing here?

19:39.164 --> 19:41.620
You presented a plan
to the Guthrie family

19:41.621 --> 19:43.821
to bolster piracy in Nassau...

19:44.730 --> 19:46.765
with Max at your side?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.703
I sincerely doubt you'd
go along with any plan

19:50.704 --> 19:53.226
that promised support for the account.

19:54.371 --> 19:56.132
And from there,

19:56.629 --> 19:59.329
my questions only multiply.

20:00.371 --> 20:03.695
Which is probably not a
state you want to leave me in.

20:08.836 --> 20:11.786
A state of multiplying questions.

20:12.508 --> 20:14.625
I suppose that makes two of us.

20:15.752 --> 20:17.370
Because there is something in the air

20:17.371 --> 20:19.953
between you and your friend up there.

20:19.954 --> 20:25.018
It's just tension between
steadfast partners.

20:27.079 --> 20:28.658
Or it's something else.

20:30.933 --> 20:35.758
We could suffer under the weight
of our respective questions.

20:38.996 --> 20:41.654
Or would you like to
start trading answers?

21:23.928 --> 21:25.325
Helm!

21:25.537 --> 21:26.828
Hard to starboard!

21:26.829 --> 21:28.786
Put the wind on the port quarter.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.953
Mr. Featherstone, set the foresail,

21:30.954 --> 21:32.953
Trim as we alter course.

21:32.954 --> 21:34.494
What's happening?

21:34.495 --> 21:36.147
We're gonna get hit.

21:45.730 --> 21:49.577
My Lord, shall we withdraw
in favor of a wider approach?

21:49.954 --> 21:51.329
No.

21:51.330 --> 21:52.950
I beg your pardon, sir,

21:52.975 --> 21:54.786
but there are easier ways
to attempt to board her.

21:54.787 --> 21:56.731
I do not wish to board her.

21:56.756 --> 21:59.544
I wish to cause confusion
and terror amongst her men.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.256
I wish to shatter their spirits.

22:01.281 --> 22:02.738
I wish to break them.

22:02.763 --> 22:05.637
And then I wish to board her.

22:05.975 --> 22:08.905
Keep her main mast aligned over the bow.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.163
Bow guns we fire at will.

22:16.495 --> 22:18.370
- Fire!
- Take cover!

22:20.412 --> 22:23.370
Helm, prepare to come
hard over to starboard.

22:23.371 --> 22:26.553
Helm, prepare to come
hard over to starboard!

22:27.371 --> 22:28.803
Now!

22:31.504 --> 22:33.052
Brace for impact!

22:33.077 --> 22:34.610
Brace for impact!

23:05.299 --> 23:07.125
Target the rail!

23:08.687 --> 23:10.494
Target the rail!

23:10.495 --> 23:12.578
Come on, men, fire at will!

23:12.579 --> 23:14.571
Take cover!

23:17.330 --> 23:18.779
Stay down!

23:28.838 --> 23:30.556
Ready the rest of the men.

23:30.581 --> 23:33.713
And lead them over the
stern. Board them at the helm.

23:36.330 --> 23:37.737
The helm?

23:37.762 --> 23:39.467
Just get them ready.

23:39.492 --> 23:42.393
When you're on-board, get
below decks and find Madi.

23:42.418 --> 23:44.584
Where are you going?

23:44.609 --> 23:46.315
To turn us around.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.544
Musket!

23:56.058 --> 23:57.409
You.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.807
Join the muskets on the foremast.

24:03.713 --> 24:05.879
Musket. Reload!

24:06.793 --> 24:08.822
Target on the quarterdeck!

25:17.127 --> 25:19.415
- We broken away!
- Yeah!

25:21.494 --> 25:23.307
Hooks at the ready!

25:23.308 --> 25:25.533
You load that now.

25:37.955 --> 25:39.587
Come on, men!

25:40.058 --> 25:41.058
Come on!

29:14.565 --> 29:16.663
What are you doing down here?

29:20.656 --> 29:22.905
Are you a fucking coward?

29:23.848 --> 29:25.397
P-please, sir.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.612
I'm just the cook.

29:44.187 --> 29:46.179
You had a prisoner here.

29:50.596 --> 29:52.594
Is she still alive?

29:55.877 --> 29:57.938
Is she still alive?!

33:42.151 --> 33:43.849
Don't worry.

33:44.029 --> 33:46.486
No one's going under the ship today.

33:46.588 --> 33:49.276
Though, the thought had crossed my mind.

33:51.975 --> 33:55.508
No, I'm quite certain I
can do better than that.

34:03.502 --> 34:06.035
I'll need cutting away completely.

34:08.291 --> 34:11.384
Time is of the essence
for what happens next.

34:13.431 --> 34:17.259
Take the better part of a day,
maybe two, to secure the chest.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.824
Captain Rackham will ferry you
back to the camp aboard the Lion

34:21.850 --> 34:23.306
to relay the news.

34:23.308 --> 34:25.384
I'd like to stay, actually.

34:27.270 --> 34:30.304
To help see the chest secured properly.

34:32.255 --> 34:35.181
Mr. Featherstone can see
her back aboard the Eurydice.

34:36.079 --> 34:40.039
Provided the majority of men
crewing the Lion are ours, not yours,

34:40.063 --> 34:42.931
and you remain on the ship
while we retrieve the chest.

34:43.596 --> 34:45.123
Yes?

35:35.223 --> 35:36.514
Let's go.

36:03.225 --> 36:05.012
We'll rest up here.

36:07.267 --> 36:09.020
I can keep going.

36:09.809 --> 36:11.535
We'll rest here.

36:32.716 --> 36:35.425
You really are getting
nimble on that thing.

36:37.466 --> 36:39.974
Pain is an exceptional tutor.

36:39.975 --> 36:41.508
Hmm.

36:44.425 --> 36:46.708
We won't be going any farther.

36:48.808 --> 36:50.406
Won't we?

36:52.672 --> 36:54.890
I won't take another
step towards that chest

36:54.891 --> 36:57.514
until I know for certain that I'm wrong

36:57.539 --> 37:00.149
about what I suspect is happening here.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.619
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:01.643 --> 37:03.555
Please don't do that.

37:11.518 --> 37:13.926
And what is it you think is happening?

37:17.308 --> 37:18.785
I show you the chest,

37:18.810 --> 37:21.308
the chest is brought
out of the ground...

37:22.232 --> 37:23.973
and then...

37:25.100 --> 37:27.307
I don't know what then exactly,

37:27.308 --> 37:32.508
but I doubt it involves returning
it to the camp as planned.

37:38.308 --> 37:39.716
Am I wrong?

37:42.641 --> 37:45.821
Tell me I am and we'll
continue on our way.

37:51.891 --> 37:53.674
And then what?

37:57.808 --> 37:59.591
This war...

38:02.107 --> 38:03.968
your war...

38:06.808 --> 38:08.593
her war...

38:13.975 --> 38:16.508
Julius will be no obstacle to it.

38:18.183 --> 38:20.692
As long as you and she stand for it...

38:21.442 --> 38:24.207
as long as the treasure powers it...

38:25.308 --> 38:27.758
nothing can stop it from beginning now.

38:29.951 --> 38:31.996
Nothing but you.

38:37.417 --> 38:39.613
Why would you want to do that?

38:47.928 --> 38:50.044
This is what it would be.

38:51.486 --> 38:55.754
Time after time after time.

38:57.183 --> 38:58.924
Endlessly.

39:01.058 --> 39:03.307
The measuring of lives...

39:03.308 --> 39:06.080
and loves and spirits...

39:06.112 --> 39:09.877
so that they may be
wagered in a grand game.

39:10.037 --> 39:13.510
How much ransom can be
afforded for the cause?

39:14.308 --> 39:18.050
How many casualties can
be tolerated for the cause?

39:19.548 --> 39:21.416
How much loss?

39:25.058 --> 39:26.921
That isn't a war.

39:28.308 --> 39:30.632
That is a fucking nightmare.

39:34.651 --> 39:38.600
And I cannot take a single step
towards leaving this forest...

39:42.394 --> 39:44.427
till I know it's over.

39:50.308 --> 39:52.536
This is how they survive.

39:56.267 --> 39:58.307
You must know this.

39:58.552 --> 40:01.508
You're too smart not to know this.

40:10.409 --> 40:13.310
They paint the world full of shadows...

40:14.261 --> 40:17.586
and then tell their children
to stay close to the light.

40:18.645 --> 40:20.092
Their light.

40:21.058 --> 40:24.014
Their reasons, their judgments.

40:25.038 --> 40:29.488
Because in the darkness,
there be dragons.

40:31.548 --> 40:33.521
But it isn't true.

40:34.717 --> 40:39.258
We can prove that it isn't true.

40:40.850 --> 40:43.598
In the dark, there is discovery,

40:43.795 --> 40:45.849
there is possibility,

40:45.850 --> 40:51.020
there is freedom in the dark

40:51.045 --> 40:53.090
once someone has illuminated it.

40:53.115 --> 40:57.140
And who has been so close to
doing it as we are right now?

40:57.141 --> 40:58.935
This isn't about England...

41:02.516 --> 41:04.240
or her king...

41:04.808 --> 41:07.115
or our freedom, or any of it.

41:09.441 --> 41:11.481
When I thought Madi was gone,

41:11.627 --> 41:13.491
I saw... for the first time,

41:13.516 --> 41:16.533
I saw the world through your eyes.

41:16.913 --> 41:20.613
A world in which there
is nothing left to lose.

41:22.456 --> 41:25.656
I felt the need to make
sense of the loss...

41:26.724 --> 41:28.894
to impart meaning to it...

41:29.480 --> 41:31.494
whatever the cost.

41:31.549 --> 41:34.296
To exalt her memory with battles...

41:34.321 --> 41:35.978
and victories.

41:38.987 --> 41:40.902
But beneath all of that,

41:40.927 --> 41:43.336
I recognized the other thing...

41:44.141 --> 41:46.046
hiding in the spaces.

41:47.141 --> 41:49.984
The one whose shape you first showed me.

41:51.995 --> 41:53.911
And when asked,

41:54.279 --> 41:57.187
it was honest about the
role it wanted to play.

42:00.308 --> 42:02.175
It was rage.

42:03.432 --> 42:06.484
And it just wanted
to see the world burn.

42:18.947 --> 42:21.564
I see a life for myself with her.

42:23.219 --> 42:25.224
And I will not live it
wondering if tomorrow

42:25.225 --> 42:28.758
is the day your nightmare
finally takes her away for good.

42:33.110 --> 42:34.923
So, what next, then?

42:36.954 --> 42:38.598
What decisions have you made

42:38.599 --> 42:41.674
about what our tomorrows will be?

42:45.504 --> 42:47.455
I made arrangements...

42:48.595 --> 42:51.375
to ensure that when we leave here,

42:51.400 --> 42:53.307
it is with compromises in place

42:53.308 --> 42:56.415
that will diffuse any threat
of widespread rebellion.

42:59.471 --> 43:01.921
All this will be for nothing.

43:06.308 --> 43:08.258
We will have been for nothing.

43:11.792 --> 43:14.159
Defined by their histories...

43:15.683 --> 43:18.886
distorted to fit into their narrative...

43:21.713 --> 43:24.222
until all that is left of us...

43:24.847 --> 43:28.297
are the monsters in the stories
they tell their children.

43:32.635 --> 43:34.377
I don't care.

43:37.308 --> 43:38.847
You will.

43:42.502 --> 43:44.578
Someday, you will.

43:46.850 --> 43:48.383
Someday.

43:50.761 --> 43:53.785
Even if you can persuade
her to keep you...

43:54.474 --> 43:57.258
she'll no longer be enough.

43:58.308 --> 44:01.168
And the comfort will grow stale.

44:02.975 --> 44:05.057
And casting about in the dark

44:05.058 --> 44:08.307
for some proof that you mattered

44:08.308 --> 44:11.285
and finding none, you'll know...

44:13.267 --> 44:15.310
that you gave it away...

44:15.335 --> 44:17.118
in this moment...

44:18.225 --> 44:20.231
on this island.

44:22.558 --> 44:24.549
Left it in the ground...

44:25.349 --> 44:27.699
along with that chest.

44:36.128 --> 44:38.181
This is not what I wanted.

44:40.502 --> 44:42.963
But I will stand here with you...

44:44.432 --> 44:46.236
for an hour,

44:46.626 --> 44:48.785
a day, a year...

44:50.058 --> 44:53.400
while you find a way to
accept this outcome...

44:54.674 --> 44:57.479
so that we might leave here together.

45:00.391 --> 45:02.127
For if not...

45:05.573 --> 45:08.236
then I must end this another way.

46:31.700 --> 46:33.907
Captain Flint is gone.

46:39.308 --> 46:40.741
Gone?

46:41.537 --> 46:43.225
Gone where?

46:43.725 --> 46:45.967
Retired from the account.

46:46.724 --> 46:51.067
He was persuaded that his
efforts were no longer viable,

46:51.092 --> 46:55.928
that those closest to him
had grown tired of them.

46:56.202 --> 46:57.873
And of him.

46:58.683 --> 47:02.508
He then chose to walk away from it all.

47:03.739 --> 47:06.170
He's no longer a concern of ours.

47:07.475 --> 47:11.682
This sounds somewhat less definitive
an end than I had expected.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.449
But far more effective.

47:15.308 --> 47:18.501
For if our intent was
to extinguish his war,

47:18.526 --> 47:20.775
feeding it a martyr

47:20.800 --> 47:23.750
seems like an odd way of going about it.

47:24.516 --> 47:26.015
Flint had allies

47:26.016 --> 47:28.819
who would've only been
emboldened by his death.

47:31.308 --> 47:33.015
Some of whom, had they the desire,

47:33.016 --> 47:36.224
could and would have
fought his war without him

47:36.225 --> 47:38.356
to honor his memory.

47:39.308 --> 47:44.015
Instead of a martyr,
we have fed it a story,

47:44.016 --> 47:49.307
a tragedy that diffused
their fighting spirit,

47:49.308 --> 47:54.001
and enabled the more
moderate voices among them

47:54.026 --> 47:57.726
to press for a more moderate solution.

48:01.112 --> 48:02.853
What is that?

48:04.343 --> 48:06.133
A treaty.

48:06.907 --> 48:10.325
Its terms conceived by Governor Rogers.

48:10.349 --> 48:14.047
Its terms agreed to by
the Maroon leaders...

48:14.683 --> 48:17.849
over a few scattered objections.

48:25.557 --> 48:27.307
I can tell you whatever
it is you want to hear

48:27.308 --> 48:29.470
about Flint's whereabouts.

48:29.495 --> 48:31.070
He's dead.

48:31.955 --> 48:33.530
He's retired.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.974
The truth of it matters not at all.

48:36.975 --> 48:40.473
The truth is there will be no
Maroon War in the West Indies

48:40.474 --> 48:43.987
because the Maroons
themselves have agreed to it.

48:50.357 --> 48:52.307
All that remains, then,

48:52.308 --> 48:55.653
is for you to purchase
Woodes Rogers' debts.

48:56.388 --> 48:58.723
Force his default and incarceration

48:58.724 --> 49:00.723
and see him replaced with a new governor

49:00.724 --> 49:03.307
who will honor these terms.

49:13.714 --> 49:17.065
You asked for proof of
Captain Flint's removal.

49:17.807 --> 49:20.007
I cannot give it to you.

49:20.975 --> 49:23.307
But this is a meaningful assurance

49:23.308 --> 49:25.901
that the pirate threat is no more.

49:28.384 --> 49:31.625
You asked for a governor
I would call husband.

49:32.510 --> 49:34.919
I cannot give that to you either.

49:36.797 --> 49:39.111
But I have given you a candidate

49:39.136 --> 49:42.883
whose trustworthiness I can guarantee.

49:44.308 --> 49:46.383
What candidate?

49:49.558 --> 49:52.289
You want me to administrate Nassau?

49:52.602 --> 49:54.682
These are the terms under
which it will happen.

49:54.683 --> 49:57.266
They are the best I can offer.

49:58.191 --> 50:00.750
Are they acceptable to you?

50:12.596 --> 50:14.338
Just one more thing.

50:20.953 --> 50:23.266
Small favor to ask...

50:23.267 --> 50:25.307
before the ink dries

50:25.308 --> 50:28.158
on whatever it is you've agreed upon.

50:28.797 --> 50:31.390
Once the demand for
repayment has been made

50:31.391 --> 50:34.884
and his default recorded
and the warrant sworn,

50:34.909 --> 50:36.734
there will be a trial.

50:38.243 --> 50:39.915
And at that trial,

50:39.940 --> 50:43.452
the court will solicit
affidavits from his creditors.

50:43.477 --> 50:48.508
Affidavits that will shape the
official narrative of the default.

50:51.367 --> 50:53.015
The failure.

50:53.016 --> 50:54.930
The humiliation.

50:55.094 --> 50:57.723
For a man like Woodes Rogers,

50:57.724 --> 51:01.946
how difficult that will
be... to sit helpless

51:02.188 --> 51:07.057
while history records
such an unflattering end

51:07.058 --> 51:10.086
to what was once such a promising story.

51:14.308 --> 51:16.637
I suppose what I'm asking is...

51:16.662 --> 51:19.748
once the time comes to
submit that affidavit,

51:19.773 --> 51:22.390
I'd so love to help you write it.

51:58.308 --> 51:59.716
Leave.

52:02.516 --> 52:03.924
No.

52:05.971 --> 52:08.682
The treaty is being ratified.

52:11.766 --> 52:14.797
The chiefs from the other
camps will be leaving shortly,

52:15.042 --> 52:17.258
along with the pirate crews.

52:17.724 --> 52:20.508
The war is over.

52:25.086 --> 52:26.554
Yes.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.700
I don't know why you did this.

52:41.850 --> 52:43.989
But I know you did this.

52:45.717 --> 52:48.890
Sent me away from that
island so I would not see it.

52:49.155 --> 52:52.675
Emboldened Julius so
I could not oppose it.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.567
Orchestrated it.

52:57.933 --> 53:01.629
Don't you dare insult
me by denying this.

53:04.933 --> 53:07.770
Flint's war could only have one result.

53:09.308 --> 53:11.153
A life of loss...

53:11.685 --> 53:13.386
and misery...

53:14.225 --> 53:16.266
and fruitless sacrifice.

53:16.699 --> 53:19.099
- I had to stop it.
- You had to stop it?

53:19.169 --> 53:20.952
And I'm not sorry for it.

53:22.446 --> 53:24.270
I lost you once.

53:25.267 --> 53:27.008
I would not do it again.

53:33.700 --> 53:36.651
Captain Flint didn't retire from this.

53:37.340 --> 53:39.654
It was important that they heard that,

53:39.679 --> 53:42.129
but they didn't know him like you do.

53:43.409 --> 53:45.733
I won't insult you by repeating it.

53:49.083 --> 53:50.918
He trusted you.

53:51.754 --> 53:53.788
He was your friend.

53:54.635 --> 53:56.502
And you killed him.

53:59.058 --> 54:00.508
No.

54:04.549 --> 54:07.082
I did not kill Captain Flint.

54:09.641 --> 54:12.723
I unmade him.

54:16.891 --> 54:20.202
The man you know could
never let go of his war.

54:20.725 --> 54:23.557
For if he were to
exclude it from himself,

54:23.713 --> 54:26.413
he would not be able
to understand himself.

54:28.016 --> 54:31.452
So I had to return him to
an earlier state of being.

54:33.424 --> 54:35.832
One in which he could
function without the war.

54:36.891 --> 54:38.795
Without the violence.

54:39.594 --> 54:41.412
Without us.

54:44.308 --> 54:47.050
Captain Flint was born
out of great tragedy.

54:47.891 --> 54:49.548
You know this.

54:49.573 --> 54:51.356
I told you this.

54:52.832 --> 54:55.964
I found a way to reach into the past...

54:56.789 --> 54:58.489
and undo it.

55:02.713 --> 55:05.413
There is a place near Savannah...

55:06.349 --> 55:08.473
where men unjustly imprisoned in England

55:08.474 --> 55:10.613
are sent in secret.

55:12.808 --> 55:15.479
An internment far more humane,

55:15.504 --> 55:17.538
but no less secure.

55:18.474 --> 55:21.152
Men who enter these
gates never leave them.

55:24.452 --> 55:26.546
To the rest of the world,

55:27.351 --> 55:29.632
they simply cease to be.

55:32.232 --> 55:34.077
I don't believe you.

55:34.913 --> 55:37.307
I don't believe this.

55:37.507 --> 55:40.501
Flint would have fought to
the death before allowing it.

55:40.526 --> 55:42.059
He resisted...

55:43.165 --> 55:44.749
at first.

55:46.308 --> 55:49.835
But then I told him what else
I had heard about this place.

55:51.349 --> 55:54.307
I was told prominent families
amongst London society

55:54.308 --> 55:56.296
made use of it.

55:56.883 --> 56:00.773
I was told the governor
in Carolina made use of it.

56:02.390 --> 56:04.307
So I sent a man to find out

56:04.308 --> 56:08.133
if they'd used it to hide
away one particular prisoner.

56:09.183 --> 56:11.508
He returned with news.

56:14.058 --> 56:16.924
Thomas Hamilton was there.

56:19.267 --> 56:21.311
He disbelieved me.

56:21.577 --> 56:23.694
He continued to resist.

56:24.661 --> 56:27.278
And corralling him took great effort.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.515
But the closer we got to Savannah,

56:30.516 --> 56:32.975
his resistance began to diminish.

56:34.789 --> 56:36.573
I couldn't say why.

56:37.226 --> 56:39.027
I wasn't expecting it.

56:40.370 --> 56:41.754
Perhaps he'd finally reached

56:41.779 --> 56:44.699
the limits of his
physical ability to fight.

56:45.137 --> 56:49.421
Or perhaps as the promise of
seeing Thomas got closer...

56:50.267 --> 56:52.424
he grew more comfortable
letting go of this man

56:52.449 --> 56:55.120
he created in response to his loss.

56:56.961 --> 57:01.910
The man whose mind I had
come to know so well...

57:03.308 --> 57:08.074
whose mind I'd in some ways
incorporated into my own.

57:10.187 --> 57:13.596
It was a strange experience
to see something from it...

57:14.975 --> 57:16.831
so unexpected.

57:19.308 --> 57:21.349
I choose to believe it...

57:22.308 --> 57:25.084
because it wasn't the man
I had come to know at all...

57:27.141 --> 57:29.716
but one who existed beforehand...

57:31.487 --> 57:33.395
waking from a long...

57:34.507 --> 57:36.506
and terrible nightmare.

57:43.481 --> 57:46.287
Reorienting to the daylight...

57:51.267 --> 57:52.640
and the world as it existed

57:52.641 --> 57:55.249
before he first closed his eyes...

58:06.831 --> 58:09.933
letting the memory of
the nightmare fade away.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:33.718
You may think what you want of me.

01:00:36.162 --> 01:00:41.082
I will draw comfort in the knowledge
that you're alive to think it.

01:00:44.025 --> 01:00:46.496
But I'm not the villain you fear I am.

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:50.746
I'm not him.

01:01:04.891 --> 01:01:06.820
You sent a man...

01:01:08.856 --> 01:01:11.015
to investigate this place?

01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:13.723
Yes.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.979
And he did this and
returned to Nassau...

01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:25.822
all before the Spanish arrived?

01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:29.623
Yes.

01:01:33.572 --> 01:01:38.052
You didn't just betray my trust.

01:01:40.576 --> 01:01:42.935
You have planned to betray it...

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.248
all that time.

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:56.328
Get out.

01:02:02.257 --> 01:02:04.532
The pirates will be leaving here.

01:02:05.757 --> 01:02:07.457
The chiefs.

01:02:10.058 --> 01:02:11.790
But I will stay.

01:02:13.618 --> 01:02:15.152
And I will wait.

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:18.716
A day...

01:02:19.975 --> 01:02:21.425
a month...

01:02:22.676 --> 01:02:24.238
a year...

01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:27.632
forever...

01:02:31.175 --> 01:02:34.800
in the hopes that you will
understand why I did what I did.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.495
Get out.

01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:12.731
A story is true.

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:15.781
A story is untrue.

01:03:21.808 --> 01:03:23.765
As time extends,

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.048
it matters less and less.

01:03:29.933 --> 01:03:33.390
The stories we want to believe...

01:03:34.538 --> 01:03:36.787
those are the ones that survive,

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:39.748
despite upheaval and transition

01:03:39.773 --> 01:03:42.421
and progress.

01:03:46.308 --> 01:03:50.682
Those are the stories
that shape history.

01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:55.706
And then what does it matter
if it was true when it was born?

01:03:55.753 --> 01:03:59.931
It's found truth in its maturity,

01:03:59.956 --> 01:04:02.417
which if a virtue in man
ought to be no less so

01:04:02.442 --> 01:04:04.531
for the things men create.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:09.136
As this relates to your
question specifically...

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:16.307
I'm sorry. Remind me, what was
your question, specifically?

01:04:16.308 --> 01:04:18.307
- Long John Silver.
- Long John Silver, yes.

01:04:18.308 --> 01:04:20.015
Please forgive me.

01:04:20.016 --> 01:04:22.140
I will go on from time to time,

01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:24.307
but generally in the
service of thoroughness

01:04:24.308 --> 01:04:26.560
and always with the best of intentions.

01:04:26.585 --> 01:04:28.224
I appreciate your indulging me.

01:04:28.225 --> 01:04:31.307
No need. I was drawn in.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:42.101
Long John Silver's story...

01:04:43.084 --> 01:04:45.007
is a hard one to know.

01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:54.234
The men who believed
most deeply in it...

01:04:57.464 --> 01:05:00.456
were ultimately destroyed by it.

01:05:16.308 --> 01:05:20.245
And those who stood to
benefit most from it...

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:24.104
were the most eager
to leave it all behind.

01:05:40.933 --> 01:05:43.932
Until all that remains of any of it...

01:05:43.933 --> 01:05:47.307
are stories bearing only
a passing resemblance

01:05:47.308 --> 01:05:49.640
to the world the rest of us lived in.

01:05:53.409 --> 01:05:55.442
A world we survived.

01:05:58.523 --> 01:06:00.640
A world that is no more.

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:06.266
I hear it ain't altogether over.

01:06:06.267 --> 01:06:09.528
I hear there are still
men on the account here

01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:11.708
under the blessing of the governor.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:14.182
I hear he allows for it...

01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:18.459
as long as it helps drive up
prices for the merchants here.

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:23.325
I hear he allows you to
continue the practice.

01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:26.434
That's why I came.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:29.489
Two things you must know

01:06:29.514 --> 01:06:31.817
if you're gonna be
spending time here with us.

01:06:31.842 --> 01:06:33.390
One, the governor.

01:06:33.391 --> 01:06:35.307
Lovely man. Dear friend.

01:06:35.308 --> 01:06:38.825
Might be the hero given
credit for the Maroon truce,

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.182
bringing peace to the West Indies,

01:06:41.183 --> 01:06:43.685
and finally, at long last,

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:46.631
bringing law and order to Nassau.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.528
But let's just say he had some help.

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:52.749
And the true power here...

01:06:52.774 --> 01:06:56.998
is a little more complicated than that.

01:07:10.016 --> 01:07:11.807
And two,

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:14.971
there is, by law...

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.985
and strict enforcement
of the administration,

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:21.765
no piracy in Nassau.

01:07:21.766 --> 01:07:24.284
Not anymore. Not ever.

01:07:25.496 --> 01:07:26.932
It's critical for commerce.

01:07:26.933 --> 01:07:29.270
This is known to the world.

01:07:30.024 --> 01:07:31.739
Meet me at the jetty.

01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:50.765
Are we ready to depart?

01:07:59.422 --> 01:08:02.358
Don't remember talking
about bringing on new people.

01:08:02.383 --> 01:08:03.849
Ah, we didn't.

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:05.555
Oh, I know we didn't.

01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:08.182
He's come from the continent.

01:08:08.207 --> 01:08:10.240
Served with the regulars in the war.

01:08:13.516 --> 01:08:16.421
Mark. Mark Read.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:31.468
You could be more
welcoming to new people.

01:08:31.493 --> 01:08:33.165
Would it hurt?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.307
Planning on bringing them all on?

01:08:35.308 --> 01:08:36.924
All of who?

01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:40.307
All the fools that have heard

01:08:40.308 --> 01:08:43.376
you may know where to find
Captain Flint's treasure.

01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:47.328
The ones thinking you may
go looking for it again.

01:08:48.143 --> 01:08:50.055
Thinking you'll make them rich.

01:08:51.593 --> 01:08:55.585
The ones I worry might
just convince you to do it.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.307
I've chased Captain Flint's treasure.

01:08:59.308 --> 01:09:01.473
I've had Captain Flint's treasure.

01:09:01.474 --> 01:09:03.254
It never ends well.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.629
Rather than rush off after it again...

01:09:07.682 --> 01:09:10.131
maybe let's just do this a while longer.

01:09:11.808 --> 01:09:13.207
Maybe...

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.359
Oh, is that it?

01:09:24.308 --> 01:09:27.220
Still don't understand what
was wrong with the one we had.

01:09:29.892 --> 01:09:33.015
Because what's it all for
if it goes unremembered?

01:09:33.015 --> 01:09:36.682
It's the art that leaves the mark.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.368
But to leave it, it must... transcend.

01:09:41.393 --> 01:09:45.593
It must speak for itself.

01:09:48.808 --> 01:09:50.649
It must be true.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:07.769
It's fine.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.107
It's fine.

01:10:15.225 --> 01:10:17.099
Get us underway.
