00:36.385 --> 00:37.885
Ugh.

00:38.186 --> 00:40.986
Reduced to marking my
camp with bear sweat.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.171
Those bears did <i> not</i> want
to give up that sweat,

00:44.327 --> 00:47.913
but it keeps the rodents from
nibbling my lumps while I sleep.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.718
Ouch! I feel
something crunchy!

00:50.826 --> 00:52.358
Like fried chicken!

00:52.937 --> 00:54.796
Oh, it <i> is</i> fried chicken!

00:57.701 --> 00:59.851
Oh, my glob...
Forest creature!

01:00.074 --> 01:01.687
I'd better eat it
real fast!

01:03.194 --> 01:04.522

Aah!

01:14.188 --> 01:16.089
What my life has become!

01:17.969 --> 01:19.293
Hello?

01:19.651 --> 01:21.218
Oh, my glob!

01:26.688 --> 01:29.215
Oh, wonderful!

01:31.904 --> 01:34.697
Welcome in, LSP.

01:34.876 --> 01:36.194
Uh, I want to go through...

01:36.262 --> 01:38.090
This place is
so clean and nice!

01:38.184 --> 01:40.200
You're so kind.

01:40.348 --> 01:41.746
Do you have a sink?!

01:41.887 --> 01:43.887
Uh, there's one in
the kitchen, and...

01:43.988 --> 01:46.316
I'll use the one
in the kitchen!

01:48.574 --> 01:50.157
I need to tell
you all the s...

01:50.234 --> 01:51.465
Get me a towel!

01:51.645 --> 01:53.004
Help me down!

01:55.582 --> 01:59.724
O-okay, I-I really do need
to tell you how to care

01:59.801 --> 02:00.936
for sweet P.

02:01.004 --> 02:03.246
Uh, there's a
proper procedure

02:03.314 --> 02:06.926
For sweet P's
special tuck-in time.

02:07.058 --> 02:09.901
You have to be
<i>real</i> sweet to him

02:09.970 --> 02:14.041
Pat him gently on the head,
kiss his cheeks...

02:14.109 --> 02:15.123
What?

02:15.191 --> 02:17.108
And give him treats.

02:17.210 --> 02:19.820
Sing to him real,
real soft and

02:19.906 --> 02:25.195
sweet and touch your forehead
to his and think the words,

02:25.349 --> 02:30.742
"you are more precious than
anything in this world,

02:30.837 --> 02:35.000
And I will <i> always,</i>
always love you."

02:35.236 --> 02:38.570
Then he'll fall asleep
and have sweet dreams.

02:38.718 --> 02:40.617
Oh, my glob,
I'll do all that!

02:40.746 --> 02:41.851
Okay, bye!

02:42.009 --> 02:43.944
Have a wonderful time!

02:45.855 --> 02:47.765
Time to get down
to the chill-out!

02:47.863 --> 02:50.131
What a princess
like me deserves.

02:50.427 --> 02:52.351
Aah! Don't hurt me!

02:52.449 --> 02:54.064
I'm Sweet P.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.039
I didn't know
you were huge.

02:56.148 --> 02:58.131
I'm hungry.

02:58.199 --> 03:01.414
Okay, let's check
what's in the fridge.

03:01.686 --> 03:02.786
Do you like pizza?

03:02.871 --> 03:04.601
I like pizza.

03:05.694 --> 03:07.078
Get the pizza,
Sweet P!

03:13.141 --> 03:14.774
Now I can kick back.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.296
Refrigerators
are just great!

03:19.976 --> 03:22.492
I never stopped to think
how great they are.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.906
Now I'm cold, though.

03:31.846 --> 03:33.445
Oh, what?!

03:36.420 --> 03:37.882
I'm still cold.

03:42.758 --> 03:46.242
Rich-person indoor fire
is just so great.

03:47.734 --> 03:49.304
I'm feeling all toasty!

03:49.486 --> 03:51.244
Must be time for toast!

03:53.641 --> 03:54.842
I'm waiting...

03:54.910 --> 03:55.921
Waiting...

03:56.018 --> 03:57.781
Waiting...
All done!

04:01.468 --> 04:03.843
It's not black and crunchy
like when I throw bread

04:03.911 --> 04:05.492
into my campfire.

04:08.931 --> 04:11.773
This music's way
better than owls' hoots.

04:13.501 --> 04:15.302
I deserve this.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.129
No! You're an animal!

04:18.267 --> 04:20.035
You can't come inside!

04:32.520 --> 04:34.878
I'm ready to be
tucked in now.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.135
Hello?

04:36.224 --> 04:38.525
Will you be sweet to me?

04:44.147 --> 04:48.641
Sweetness must be out there
in the night to guide my

04:48.709 --> 04:50.766
sleepy boat right.

05:00.497 --> 05:01.497
Yo!

05:01.582 --> 05:03.374
Hey, Marcy!

05:03.485 --> 05:05.711
Lspita bread, what's up?

05:05.915 --> 05:09.540
Just chillin' in my
awesome bubble bath!

05:09.688 --> 05:12.047
Did you break into
someone's house again?

05:12.656 --> 05:16.086
I have a <i> new</i> life
now and a career

05:16.196 --> 05:18.165
I didn't know you
had any skills.

05:18.299 --> 05:20.227
Success isn't
about skills.

05:20.352 --> 05:21.977
It's about being cool.

05:22.086 --> 05:25.206
These people just randomly
approached me, like,

05:25.274 --> 05:28.362
"hey, we will totally pay you
to hang out in our sick mansion

05:28.430 --> 05:30.743
and feed our baby
or whatever."

05:30.878 --> 05:32.602
Well, good for you, dude.

05:32.829 --> 05:36.153
I mean, I feel like a totally
new person now that I'm finally

05:36.221 --> 05:37.455
getting what I deserve.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.797
Oh, my glob,
what is that?!

05:42.425 --> 05:43.565
Aah!

05:43.633 --> 05:44.844
LSP?

05:45.161 --> 05:46.561
Mm.

05:50.007 --> 05:51.907
Take this, you dandruff!

05:54.200 --> 05:55.422
LSP.

05:55.508 --> 05:56.620
Huh?

05:56.688 --> 06:00.555
You don't belong here in
the world of decent people.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.540
You belong in
the woods with...

06:02.631 --> 06:04.727
Garbage animals!

06:05.039 --> 06:07.899
Noooooooo!

06:13.693 --> 06:16.235
Will you be sweet to me?

06:23.408 --> 06:26.543
Will you kiss my cheeks?

06:29.637 --> 06:32.630
Will you give me treats?

06:34.504 --> 06:36.028
Blech!

06:44.218 --> 06:46.997
Will <i> you</i> be sweet to me?

06:48.563 --> 06:50.330
Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!

06:50.400 --> 06:51.891
Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!

06:54.344 --> 06:55.575
Agh!

06:59.708 --> 07:02.184
Look what you've done, LSP.

07:02.252 --> 07:03.304
Huh?

07:03.372 --> 07:04.637
You made it gross.

07:04.714 --> 07:07.739
Everything you
touch turns gross!

07:07.807 --> 07:08.941
Uh...

07:09.009 --> 07:10.114
Just like you!

07:10.182 --> 07:11.430
Aah!

07:11.627 --> 07:15.301
You don't really think you
deserved <i> any</i> of this, do you?

07:15.442 --> 07:19.085
You're a rat, just a
giant rat that wandered

07:19.162 --> 07:21.981
into somebody's
<i>nice</i> house.

07:22.092 --> 07:23.747
I'm a good person!

07:23.815 --> 07:26.106
I take care of babies!

07:27.295 --> 07:28.966
Look!

07:30.957 --> 07:32.880
Baby Sweet P?

07:35.013 --> 07:37.919
Baby Sweet P!

07:38.577 --> 07:40.656
Oh, my glob,
I lost the baby!

07:40.724 --> 07:42.031
I lost the baby!

07:42.099 --> 07:44.091
I'm a bad person!

07:45.787 --> 07:49.216
Just accept that
you're garbage!

07:49.290 --> 07:50.616
Hi-yah!

07:50.684 --> 07:52.255
Baby Sweet P!

07:54.312 --> 07:56.739
Have you seen a big,
fat child around here?!

07:56.847 --> 07:59.231
Have you seen
my enormous baby?!

08:00.903 --> 08:03.036
If only I'd
cooked the pizza!

08:03.880 --> 08:05.630
I could've
eaten some, too!

08:05.716 --> 08:07.231
I'm so stupid!

08:07.389 --> 08:08.591
You got to help me!

08:08.770 --> 08:10.546
I lost some old
couple's baby

08:10.614 --> 08:12.705
'cause I didn't
do the sweet things!

08:12.825 --> 08:14.950
I just wanted a
bubble bath, and...

08:15.037 --> 08:17.153
How did I lose
something so

08:17.387 --> 08:20.145
<i>BI-I-I-I-G?!</i>

08:20.889 --> 08:23.257
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to come with us.

08:23.498 --> 08:25.547
Baby Sweet P!

08:25.726 --> 08:26.941
Give me that donut!

08:27.009 --> 08:28.500
No!

08:29.523 --> 08:31.413
I'm not a bad person!

08:31.481 --> 08:32.958
I'm not a bad person!

08:33.027 --> 08:34.033
Huh?

08:35.063 --> 08:37.072
Hey, big baby!

08:42.250 --> 08:44.353
I found you!

08:45.334 --> 08:47.158
LSP!

08:49.571 --> 08:50.908
Sweet P!

08:50.976 --> 08:52.066
I'm so sorry!

08:52.246 --> 08:54.423
I should've been
sweet to you!

08:54.609 --> 08:56.524
Here, okay, um...

08:56.750 --> 08:58.861
Pat very gently
on the head...

08:58.945 --> 09:00.512
Kiss on both cheeks...

09:00.730 --> 09:02.081
Mwah! Mwah!

09:02.156 --> 09:03.234
Treat.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.503
Mmm!

09:05.014 --> 09:07.415
Uh, and sing
something sweet.

09:49.314 --> 09:50.852

09:53.440 --> 09:56.816
Mr. and Mrs. Pig Trunks,
I have some good news.

09:57.864 --> 10:02.370
Sweet P has grown <i> so</i> attached to
me that it would be cruel for me

10:02.438 --> 10:04.011
to leave him, obviously.

10:04.079 --> 10:06.262
<i>SO...</i>

10:06.433 --> 10:07.867
Yes, I will accept
the position

10:07.935 --> 10:09.878
as your live-in nanny!

10:15.526 --> 10:16.620
Huh?

10:17.459 --> 10:19.326
Partake of the chicken.

10:33.196 --> 10:34.603

I don't know.

10:40.330 --> 10:41.548
Mama?

10:41.616 --> 10:46.377
I had that dream again...
The one where I'm a comet boy.

10:46.491 --> 10:47.806
Oh, really?

10:47.874 --> 10:52.705
Yeah, coming back to
Ooo over and over,

10:52.845 --> 10:57.673
and there was a fake comet,
a beard man in a spaceship.

10:57.816 --> 11:02.228
My, what an imagination...

11:03.119 --> 11:04.869
