WEBVTT

00:08.421 --> 00:11.860
- Paige, where you been? You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, I got tied up.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.579
Where? At Richard's?

00:13.807 --> 00:17.041
No, I was at work.
Get your mind out of the gutter, missy.

00:17.355 --> 00:20.236
Hey, you're the one that orbs home
to find lingerie.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.642
Two times. I did that twice.

00:22.907 --> 00:25.265
Yeah, it's about the only time
we ever see you anymore.

00:25.579 --> 00:28.049
- Why did I come? To get picked on?
- Because we love you.

00:28.334 --> 00:29.609
We kind of miss you.

00:29.837 --> 00:32.558
I am not at Richard's that much.

00:33.887 --> 00:36.802
Fine, maybe I am. But I am just
an orb away if you need help.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.901
The thing is,
we just gotta be careful.

00:39.149 --> 00:42.030
If we stray too far from each other,
demons take advantage.

00:42.322 --> 00:44.884
We've learned that lesson
the hard way a few times.

00:45.161 --> 00:47.472
I know, I know, I get it.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.709
I just really don't wanna think of us
living together in 50 years.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.463
Twenty, 30 years, tops.

00:53.717 --> 00:56.075
We can move to Hong Kong
so I can see Jason whenever I want.

00:56.348 --> 00:59.184
How do you say "dream on"
in Chinese?

01:01.024 --> 01:02.663
- Impressive.
- Berlitz.

01:03.404 --> 01:05.283
Okay, what about you, missy?

01:05.532 --> 01:07.365
- Spill it!
- Spill what?

01:07.620 --> 01:09.739
Come on, you and Greg?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.639
Put out any fires lately?

01:11.878 --> 01:13.632
Is that supposed to be
a fireman reference?

01:13.882 --> 01:15.521
- Yeah, you like it?
- Wait a minute.

01:15.761 --> 01:17.559
You're going out with a fire-fighter?

01:17.807 --> 01:19.879
Proof positive
you haven't been around much.

01:20.144 --> 01:22.945
Let's see, they've been seeing
each other for about three weeks,

01:23.234 --> 01:26.753
and someone, I won't say who,
although it's not the fireman,

01:27.075 --> 01:29.068
is avoiding taking it to the next step.

01:29.330 --> 01:33.453
I'm not avoiding.
I'm just a little reluctant, that's all.

01:33.797 --> 01:36.598
My dear, it is time
to get back in the saddle.

01:36.885 --> 01:38.764
Now a cowboy reference.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.928
Piper, you just need to relax
and let it happen.

01:41.186 --> 01:44.580
Easy for you to say. You weren't
sleeping with an angel for three years.

01:44.902 --> 01:48.694
Yeah, but you were nervous when you
and Leo first started... You know?

01:49.035 --> 01:53.192
I seem to remember that you used
to freeze him during all the good parts.

01:54.004 --> 01:55.234
Hey, maybe you should...

01:55.466 --> 01:57.220
No. I'm not freezing Greg.

01:57.469 --> 01:59.462
I'm so nervous,
I'd probably blow him up.

01:59.765 --> 02:03.921
- Well?
- Gutter, gutter, gutter.

02:04.274 --> 02:05.754
What are you guys talking about?

02:05.985 --> 02:07.340
Stuff.

02:07.572 --> 02:10.726
- Hey, where you going?
- I gotta go work on the next demon...

02:11.037 --> 02:12.391
...stration.

02:12.623 --> 02:14.502
Why don't you relax
and have a drink with us?

02:14.751 --> 02:16.823
Thanks, but I didn't
come here to relax.

02:18.843 --> 02:20.722
That is one bitchy whitelighter.

02:20.973 --> 02:22.248
You're telling me.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.595
Hey, Piper, why don't you go talk
to the guilt machine over there?

02:36.335 --> 02:38.214
Bianca.

02:41.137 --> 02:44.052
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

02:46.189 --> 02:47.543
There'll be time to explain later.

02:48.527 --> 02:49.644
But for now...

02:57.671 --> 02:58.991
You know, all work and no... Hey!

03:08.401 --> 03:10.633
Are you okay?

03:11.906 --> 03:13.705
Yeah, I think so.

03:13.952 --> 03:16.310
What happened? Who was she?

03:17.918 --> 03:19.239
I don't know.

04:31.270 --> 04:35.028
- Is that the mark?
- No, it looked more like a bird.

04:35.404 --> 04:39.286
A bird? So maybe the Audubon Society
sent the demon after us?

04:39.621 --> 04:41.135
Just keep looking.

04:41.374 --> 04:43.810
Guys, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Don't sweat it.

04:44.087 --> 04:46.045
- You sure she wasn't a darklighter?
- I'm sure.

04:46.301 --> 04:47.974
What else would be after
a whitelighter?

04:48.220 --> 04:49.575
I don't know.
That's what worries me.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.242
Piper blew her away,
what's the big deal?

04:51.478 --> 04:53.869
The big deal is someone
tried to kill you, Chris.

04:54.149 --> 04:56.825
Look at me. Not a scratch, nothing.

04:57.198 --> 04:58.712
How did she get that close
to you anyway

04:58.950 --> 05:00.465
if you didn't even know
who she was?

05:00.704 --> 05:03.460
- We really ought to fix that, you know.
- Come on, who's after you?

05:03.751 --> 05:05.903
Has it crossed your mind
that maybe she wasn't after me?

05:06.172 --> 05:07.526
Maybe she was trying
to get to them.

05:08.301 --> 05:10.498
- Kind of makes sense.
- Finally, somebody's listening.

05:10.764 --> 05:13.327
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some work to take care of.

05:17.821 --> 05:20.657
- He's not telling the truth.
- Leo, maybe there's nothing to tell.

05:21.871 --> 05:23.703
- Could you sense anything?
- From Chris?

05:23.958 --> 05:25.472
No, I can never sense
anything from him.

05:27.339 --> 05:29.377
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

05:29.635 --> 05:33.154
that if we figure out who she was,
we might figure out who Chris is.

05:33.475 --> 05:35.753
Well, we're not gonna find it in here,

05:36.023 --> 05:37.616
at least not until we have
more to go on.

05:37.860 --> 05:41.219
So you guys know where
I'm gonna be if you need me.

05:41.534 --> 05:42.764
Yeah, I gotta go too.

05:44.205 --> 05:46.243
Wait, you're just gonna let them go?

05:46.543 --> 05:48.422
What do you want me to say?
They have lives too.

05:48.673 --> 05:50.107
Besides, what more can we do?

05:50.383 --> 05:53.219
Figure out who the demon is and
make sure nobody else is after him.

05:54.058 --> 05:56.495
<i>I'll get it, you just keep checking
on the Book, okay?</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:58.966
No, Leo, really, I'd rather you...

06:05.999 --> 06:07.957
Can I help you?

06:08.212 --> 06:09.932
Yeah, is Piper home?

06:10.550 --> 06:11.825
Who's asking?

06:12.053 --> 06:15.173
- I'm Greg. She's expecting me.
- Leo, I got it.

06:16.353 --> 06:18.072
Sorry. Running a little late.

06:19.609 --> 06:22.410
- Leo? As in your?
- Yeah.

06:22.698 --> 06:25.659
One and the same.
Leo, Greg. Greg, Leo.

06:25.954 --> 06:27.309
Nice to finally meet you.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.737
Thanks. "Finally."

06:30.003 --> 06:33.761
So are you gonna be okay taking care
of everything? Wyatt and Chris?

06:35.181 --> 06:37.378
Yeah, absolutely.

06:38.979 --> 06:42.055
Really, everything will be fine.
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

06:43.196 --> 06:45.587
Okay, thanks. Good night.

07:39.223 --> 07:40.704
Will you marry me?

07:40.935 --> 07:42.814
You're asking me now?

07:43.064 --> 07:44.419
Here?

07:44.651 --> 07:46.689
This is still our spot, Bianca,

07:46.947 --> 07:48.860
no matter what he's done to it.

07:49.118 --> 07:50.394
Marry me.

07:51.373 --> 07:53.650
On one condition.

07:54.712 --> 07:58.470
You come back to me. Safely.

07:58.802 --> 08:00.237
Have I ever let you down before?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.659
What's that?

08:12.414 --> 08:13.530
Chris!

08:15.378 --> 08:17.291
Are you okay?

08:17.549 --> 08:21.466
Yeah. Yeah, I don't think
it had time to transmit.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.958
I cannot believe he's sending
probes after us now.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.634
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.825
No. No, you're not.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.607
- You're gonna stick to the plan.
- But he knows.

08:35.876 --> 08:38.234
No, if he knew, he wouldn't
have sent the probe.

08:39.299 --> 08:40.529
You have to go back, Chris.

08:41.261 --> 08:42.537
It's the only way to stop him.

08:42.765 --> 08:45.042
It's the only way to change all this.

09:02.763 --> 09:04.596
Morning.

09:04.851 --> 09:07.732
- Wow.
- Wow?

09:08.024 --> 09:11.623
One of the most powerful witches in
the world and all you can say is "wow."

09:11.948 --> 09:14.340
I don't know, maybe I just need
a little more inspiration.

09:21.466 --> 09:23.902
- Well?
- I...

09:24.180 --> 09:26.935
I still think "wow"
pretty much covers it.

09:28.981 --> 09:31.373
You better be careful,
because a girl could get used to this.

09:32.028 --> 09:33.861
That's the plan.

09:35.369 --> 09:37.407
Did you tell your sisters
you were moving out?

09:40.420 --> 09:42.333
- No.
- Look, it just...

09:42.591 --> 09:45.870
It hasn't really been the right time.
Things have been a little funky and...

09:46.306 --> 09:47.786
There's never a right time.

09:48.018 --> 09:51.650
You don't understand. Piper would
probably blow a major gasket,

09:51.985 --> 09:54.946
and then we've got
all the family obligations

09:55.241 --> 09:57.120
and, like it or not,
we're stronger together.

09:59.165 --> 10:00.758
You gotta do something for you.

10:04.675 --> 10:06.828
Can I get that?

10:09.393 --> 10:10.953
It's the house.

10:12.651 --> 10:13.926
Hello?

10:14.697 --> 10:15.687
Yeah.

10:17.452 --> 10:19.571
When I said I needed you,
I meant a fully clothed you.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.348
Oh, please, Leo.
What's the big emergency?

10:22.629 --> 10:25.704
What would you say if I said whoever
attacked Chris was called a Phoenix?

10:26.011 --> 10:29.644
Well, I would say "What's a Phoenix?"
and then you'd probably tell me.

10:29.976 --> 10:31.855
Well, they're a family
of assassin witches

10:32.147 --> 10:35.826
who are very elite, very powerful and
were born with a distinctive birthmark

10:36.154 --> 10:38.387
symbolizing the rise
from Salem's ashes.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.935
<i>Does the Book say what they want?</i>

10:40.287 --> 10:42.326
Just whatever bounty they're after,

10:42.584 --> 10:45.465
which in this case is Chris,
which means they're still after him.

10:45.757 --> 10:47.317
They won't stop until they succeed.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.240
Did you call Phoebe and Piper?

10:49.472 --> 10:51.145
No. Phoebe's at work

10:51.393 --> 10:54.672
and Piper came in kind of late,
so I didn't wanna disturb her.

10:56.277 --> 10:59.032
Did she come home alone?

11:00.033 --> 11:02.026
- I don't know.
- Hey.

11:02.539 --> 11:05.454
- Talking about me?
- Morning. Hi. No.

11:07.299 --> 11:08.779
Listen, Wyatt's been fed,

11:09.053 --> 11:13.892
and I'm gonna get some coffee
and Paige will fill you in.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.479
What's going on?

11:17.945 --> 11:21.623
Oh, Leo just found out
that a coven of assassin witches

11:21.954 --> 11:24.390
called "the Phoenix" are after Chris.

11:24.666 --> 11:26.579
So that's what you guys
were talking about?

11:26.838 --> 11:31.518
Yeah, in the beginning,
and then I just kind of asked him

11:31.890 --> 11:34.247
if you'd maybe come home
with anybody.

11:34.896 --> 11:38.369
- I see.
- Did you?

11:40.573 --> 11:43.215
Oh, come on! If a girl can't ask that,
what can a girl ask?

11:43.788 --> 11:45.906
Actually, no.

11:47.003 --> 11:49.200
I'm sorry.
Maybe he's just not the right guy.

11:49.464 --> 11:51.935
No, it's not Greg. It's just me.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.593
It's just weird now that I'm a mom.

11:54.851 --> 11:58.689
I feel like I'm
betraying Wyatt somehow.

11:59.026 --> 12:00.700
I think you're just betraying yourself.

12:00.947 --> 12:03.099
Yeah, I know, it's just weird.

12:03.367 --> 12:06.123
So a coven of assassin witches?

12:06.832 --> 12:09.189
- Yep.
- Maybe we should call Phoebe.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.582
No, I think we can do this by ourselves.
I don't think you have to bother her.

12:12.886 --> 12:14.958
What if we need the power of three
after we find them?

12:15.223 --> 12:17.501
You didn't need the power of three
to blow up the last one.

12:17.771 --> 12:18.761
No, but...

12:18.981 --> 12:21.019
So we need to try this whole
power of two thing,

12:21.279 --> 12:22.599
learn how to be flexible, right?

12:22.823 --> 12:25.340
So you stay here,
I'm gonna go get the scrying crystal.

12:31.465 --> 12:33.901
Phoebe, I offered you the time off,
take it.

12:34.178 --> 12:35.692
Go see Jason in Hong Kong.

12:35.931 --> 12:39.006
It's just another airport, another city.

12:40.148 --> 12:42.061
You can always send in the column.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.045
E-mail, fax machine!

12:45.284 --> 12:48.359
It's the 21 st century
and I'd like to welcome you to it.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.763
When I say "take time,"

12:52.048 --> 12:53.277
I don't mean a vacation.

12:55.011 --> 12:57.049
Go live there for a while,
give it a shot.

12:58.226 --> 12:59.660
- Elise, l...
- Go!

12:59.895 --> 13:01.454
I want you to listen to me.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.268
It's time I gave you
some advice for once.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.828
Don't let it be work.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.562
What do you mean?

13:09.790 --> 13:13.308
There's a whole generation of women
out there who followed the dream,

13:13.632 --> 13:16.467
built successful careers,

13:16.763 --> 13:18.960
but at the expense
of everything else.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.233
I'm not saying I think
they all made mistakes,

13:21.480 --> 13:24.361
because some of them
are very happy.

13:25.196 --> 13:26.677
But some of us aren't.

13:27.868 --> 13:28.904
Trust me,

13:29.579 --> 13:33.291
you don't wanna
wake up one day and realize

13:33.628 --> 13:35.142
that all you've got is your career.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.715
Hi, how's it going?

13:43.606 --> 13:45.360
- Can I help you?
- Hopefully.

13:45.610 --> 13:48.446
Yeah, see, we just moved in
from out of state,

13:48.742 --> 13:50.382
and wanted to get to know
our neighbours.

13:50.787 --> 13:52.302
Oh, well, welcome.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.373
- Where did you move from?
- Phoenix.

13:55.003 --> 13:56.073
Really?

13:57.216 --> 13:59.174
Please, come in, come in.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.174
Thank you.

14:06.944 --> 14:09.507
- Nice place.
- Yeah, real nice.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.263
Thank you.

14:11.494 --> 14:12.769
Mommy, Mommy.

14:12.998 --> 14:14.637
Mommy. Mommy, can I play with...

14:14.875 --> 14:16.754
Bianca, can you give Mommy
a minute, okay?

14:17.005 --> 14:18.359
Okay.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.440
Go and play with your toys.

14:20.679 --> 14:22.912
- I'll be right in, okay?
- Okay.

14:23.226 --> 14:24.900
Now what?

14:26.483 --> 14:28.123
Look out!

14:30.700 --> 14:32.215
The kid.

14:36.879 --> 14:38.552
Hurry, Bianca.

14:39.175 --> 14:40.735
They can re-form?

14:40.970 --> 14:45.126
Apparently. Which means the one
that attacked Chris can too.

15:00.215 --> 15:03.290
You really shouldn't try
to orb anymore, you know?

15:03.639 --> 15:04.868
It could kill you.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.535
Is that what you want?

15:06.769 --> 15:08.966
If that's what I wanted,
you'd already be dead.

15:09.232 --> 15:12.353
All I want is to bring you back.

15:12.947 --> 15:14.382
How did you know I'd be here?

15:14.618 --> 15:17.374
Same reason you knew
I'd be waiting here.

15:17.666 --> 15:22.620
- I mean, this is still our spot, isn't it?
- No.

15:23.845 --> 15:26.408
This is what we hoped it would be.

15:26.684 --> 15:29.724
This is what we were trying to preserve
for our future. Do you remember?

15:30.276 --> 15:32.633
We were naive to think
we could change anything.

15:32.904 --> 15:35.102
- To stop him.
- You don't believe that.

15:38.082 --> 15:40.359
- Or at least you didn't.
- Well, I do now.

15:40.628 --> 15:42.143
What happened to you, Bianca?

15:42.882 --> 15:44.363
How did he turn you back?

15:45.305 --> 15:47.218
That's not important.

15:47.476 --> 15:51.075
What is important is I was interrupted
in stripping you of your powers.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.713
And if I don't finish what I started,
you'll die soon.

15:55.032 --> 15:57.423
Think of it as an infection.

15:57.703 --> 15:59.775
And I'm the only one
with the antidote.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.635
Here or there, I am dead anyway.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.279
No.

16:03.506 --> 16:06.660
He gave me his word
he wouldn't hurt you.

16:06.972 --> 16:09.044
Please, Chris.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.350
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

16:19.537 --> 16:20.938
Wait, how old is the little girl?

16:21.165 --> 16:23.317
I don't know. Four, 5?

16:25.382 --> 16:27.136
Chris!

16:30.267 --> 16:31.941
Bianca...

16:43.335 --> 16:44.530
Oh, my God, what is that?

16:44.755 --> 16:46.907
- I don't know.
- Doesn't matter, just heal him.

16:48.929 --> 16:50.204
Why didn't he tell us about that?

16:50.432 --> 16:52.231
Why doesn't he tell us
about a lot of things?

16:55.358 --> 16:56.508
What's the problem?

16:56.736 --> 16:58.056
He's not healing.

16:58.281 --> 17:01.081
Something's draining his powers
and blocking mine, it's like a virus.

17:01.371 --> 17:02.521
A virus named Bianca.

17:02.748 --> 17:04.580
- You think she did this?
- It's gotta be.

17:04.836 --> 17:08.752
But it doesn't explain why she would
come back from the future to kill him.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.564
Well, somebody had to have sent her,
she's a hired gun.

17:11.890 --> 17:15.489
Well, we have to find her to save him,
figure out what she did...

17:16.984 --> 17:17.974
What is it?

17:21.117 --> 17:23.587
Oh, my God. He loves her.

17:24.415 --> 17:27.251
- Loves who? Bianca?
- Yeah.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.982
She broke his heart.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.880
Engagement ring.

17:41.825 --> 17:44.500
Obviously an acrimonious split.

17:44.789 --> 17:46.941
Well, at least we have
something to scry for her now.

17:47.836 --> 17:52.038
You work on the vanquishing potion
in case she's not in the mood to help.

17:55.685 --> 17:57.757
Bianca.

18:02.155 --> 18:03.875
Bianca.

18:04.118 --> 18:06.794
<i>Welcome to
the Halliwell Memorial Museum.</i>

18:07.124 --> 18:10.199
A tribute to magic and, of course,
the Charmed Ones.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.022
Please remember there is no
digi-capturing, no holographing

18:13.303 --> 18:16.616
and most certainly no magic allowed
while inside the museum.

18:16.935 --> 18:18.085
That's a big one.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.275
Don't worry about those probes, folks,
they're merely scanning for witches.

18:21.819 --> 18:25.896
As we pass through the foyer, note the
family portraits hanging on the walls

18:26.246 --> 18:29.480
which date all the way back
to the witch trials.

18:33.385 --> 18:34.899
Nicely done.

18:35.138 --> 18:38.292
Around you, you'll notice just a few
of the many mythological creatures

18:38.603 --> 18:42.885
the legendary sisters transformed into
in their demon-fighting heyday.

18:43.238 --> 18:47.953
The Charmed Ones were responsible
for over 1,000 demon vanquishes

18:48.373 --> 18:51.368
before they were finally
vanquished themselves.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.093
Now, the time is 25 years ago.

18:56.388 --> 18:59.542
Imagine yourself standing here
on this very floor

18:59.895 --> 19:02.411
when the Charmed Ones
were reborn.

19:14.924 --> 19:16.917
Okay, what was that?

19:17.680 --> 19:19.912
I think that means
you're supposed to be here.

19:30.455 --> 19:31.809
Scares them every time.

19:32.041 --> 19:35.720
Let's go to the kitchen where many
of the sisters' potions were brewed,

19:36.049 --> 19:38.885
some of which are available
for purchase in the gift shop.

19:41.728 --> 19:44.609
Of course, the attic was
the preferred spot for potion-making,

19:44.900 --> 19:47.656
<i>principally because that's where they
kept the famed Book of Shadows,</i>

19:47.948 --> 19:49.542
which is where we're headed next.

19:50.201 --> 19:53.914
A little background on the manor itself.
It was actually destroyed...

20:01.851 --> 20:04.687
- Hey, you two, move along.
- Wait for it.

20:07.529 --> 20:11.412
Are you deaf? I sa...

20:19.218 --> 20:20.892
Come on.

20:32.493 --> 20:35.773
We should be safe here
until the museum closes.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.041
<i>Then we'll go get the Book.</i>

20:38.881 --> 20:40.874
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

20:41.135 --> 20:44.848
It's just sometimes I forget
who you really are.

20:45.185 --> 20:46.905
Hey.

20:47.148 --> 20:48.502
Come here.

20:51.198 --> 20:53.031
You mean how I used to be, Chris.

20:53.284 --> 20:55.038
Before I met you.

20:55.790 --> 20:58.546
So, what do we do now?

21:01.509 --> 21:03.706
We say goodbye.

21:30.816 --> 21:32.217
Who are you
and what do you want?

21:32.444 --> 21:33.844
Where's the grimoire?

21:34.073 --> 21:35.666
One more time. Who are you?

21:36.786 --> 21:38.619
Who do you think I am...

21:41.546 --> 21:44.222
...Mother?
- Bianca?

21:44.511 --> 21:46.344
In the flesh.
Now, where's the grimoire?

21:46.598 --> 21:50.072
I have to get the Charmed Ones
off my tail fast. I need a spell to do it.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.318
I don't understand,
how is this possible?

21:52.903 --> 21:54.861
Look, I don't have time
for reunions, okay?

21:55.115 --> 21:57.551
And I won't make the same mistake
a thousand other demons have.

21:57.828 --> 21:59.148
Now, where's the damn book?

22:02.378 --> 22:03.859
Thanks.

22:06.345 --> 22:08.862
- Where is the inhibition spell?
- How is that gonna help?

22:09.183 --> 22:11.096
I know the Charmed Ones,
I studied their history.

22:11.354 --> 22:12.835
This is when they want
separate lives.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.582
If I release certain inhibitions,
I can get them to pursue them.

22:15.863 --> 22:17.183
The spell won't last long.

22:17.449 --> 22:20.250
It just has to distract them
so I can get what I came for.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.062
Got it.

22:23.294 --> 22:24.615
Thanks.

22:25.591 --> 22:27.025
Wait.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.709
Do you have to leave so soon?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.336
Can't I help?

22:33.273 --> 22:34.993
Yeah.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.956
Someday, when I ask you
what it feels like to kill,

22:38.240 --> 22:39.276
don't lie to me.

22:40.870 --> 22:42.544
Don't tell me you don't feel a thing.

22:51.476 --> 22:53.673
Hang in there, buddy.

22:55.526 --> 22:57.678
We found Bianca,
she's at her mother's.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.621
- Little Bianca?
- No, the one we want.

22:59.867 --> 23:04.388
Here. Something for Chris
to remember her by, or not.

23:04.752 --> 23:09.467
Got the vanquishing potion,
so after we orb over there, I'm gonna...

23:13.685 --> 23:16.839
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna move into Richard's house.

23:17.193 --> 23:19.584
- Are you? Good for you.
- That's a great idea.

23:19.864 --> 23:22.427
And I think I'm gonna go check out
what's going on in Hong Kong.

23:22.703 --> 23:24.138
- Cool.
- Hang on a second.

23:24.372 --> 23:25.853
This isn't you guys.

23:26.085 --> 23:28.476
You must be under some kind of spell.
You have to fight this.

23:28.756 --> 23:30.795
- How can you fight your heart?
- Or your hormones?

23:31.052 --> 23:32.202
Yeah.

23:32.430 --> 23:34.423
Will you drop me off
on the way to Richard's?

23:34.684 --> 23:37.247
- I would love to.
- Paige, Phoebe, listen to me.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.521
Wait.

23:47.543 --> 23:48.739
What do I tell them?

23:52.763 --> 23:53.833
Don't tell them anything.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.887
Just stick to your cover story. The less
they know about the future, the better.

23:58.190 --> 24:00.946
- What if they find out who I really am?
- They won't.

24:01.238 --> 24:04.358
Not as long as you can
pass yourself off as their whitelighter.

24:04.661 --> 24:06.460
You're sure I won't lose my powers
when I go?

24:06.707 --> 24:08.586
Not with this spell,
that's why we need it.

24:09.045 --> 24:13.521
But just remember, protect baby Wyatt
and you protect the Charmed Ones.

24:13.888 --> 24:15.721
Keep them alive for our future.

24:16.434 --> 24:19.509
Great. No pressure there.

24:20.150 --> 24:22.906
Chris, you know you're
the only one who can do this.

24:24.367 --> 24:26.280
You're the only one
who can save us.

24:26.579 --> 24:28.458
If I make it back.

24:29.418 --> 24:31.888
Baby, you have to make it back...

24:32.549 --> 24:34.667
...if you wanna marry me.

24:42.609 --> 24:44.249
You really know how
to motivate a guy.

24:52.003 --> 24:54.678
<i>- Sure you can summon the real Book?
- Yeah.</i>

24:55.010 --> 24:57.446
- Away from him?
- Yeah.

24:57.723 --> 24:59.477
But we won't have much time
once it gets here.

24:59.769 --> 25:01.204
His demons will be all over us.

25:01.439 --> 25:03.432
We won't need much time.

25:03.735 --> 25:06.650
Just long enough
to send you back to them.

25:15.091 --> 25:16.286
Hurry.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.902
Before he finds us.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.661
Paige?

25:23.900 --> 25:26.132
Phoebe, get back here right now.
That's an order.

25:28.158 --> 25:30.629
Wyatt's sleeping
and the monitor is in the kitchen.

25:30.955 --> 25:32.834
Okay, Piper, but you can't go.
What about Chris?

25:33.084 --> 25:35.042
Wish me luck.

25:47.321 --> 25:50.441
Come on. We're going home.

26:11.994 --> 26:14.715
- Hey, hold it.
- Why?

26:15.042 --> 26:18.799
Because I just wanna make sure
that you're sure about this.

26:19.134 --> 26:20.933
What's the matter?
Am I not acting sure?

26:21.221 --> 26:25.582
Yeah, it's just that, well, you've been
a little reluctant until now.

26:25.939 --> 26:28.580
And I guess I'm just curious,
why the change?

26:30.363 --> 26:32.037
Who knows? Who cares?

26:32.284 --> 26:34.595
All I know is I want...

26:35.749 --> 26:36.899
Oh, my God.

26:38.087 --> 26:41.366
What? Are you out of your mind?

26:41.678 --> 26:44.114
What are you, a peeping Elder now?

26:49.192 --> 26:51.344
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

26:53.491 --> 26:54.687
What are you doing here?

26:54.912 --> 26:58.112
Counteracting a spell
that Bianca apparently cast on you.

26:58.670 --> 27:03.111
- What kind of spell?
- One that lowers your inhibitions.

27:04.849 --> 27:07.365
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:08.189 --> 27:09.465
So did she get Chris?

27:09.692 --> 27:11.446
Yeah, and I'm hoping
if we can break the spell

27:11.696 --> 27:14.532
on Phoebe and Paige,
we might be able to get Chris back.

27:14.827 --> 27:16.899
Right, okay, so let's go.

27:19.461 --> 27:22.023
You need to turn around,
because you don't get to see anymore.

27:35.659 --> 27:37.174
Hi, how's it going?

27:38.289 --> 27:40.805
- What are you doing here?
- Moving you back home. Hit her.

27:43.799 --> 27:47.842
No time to explain. Come on. We gotta
get Phoebe or we'll never get Chris.

27:51.105 --> 27:53.906
Just let me finish what I started.

27:54.946 --> 27:57.303
You'll feel better soon, I promise.

27:57.953 --> 27:59.592
That's it.

28:00.541 --> 28:02.933
Easy does it.

28:04.341 --> 28:05.822
Slow breaths.

28:09.225 --> 28:11.343
- What did you do to me?
- I just saved your life.

28:11.604 --> 28:13.837
By taking away my powers?

28:21.374 --> 28:23.446
How are you gonna
bring me back anyway?

28:23.713 --> 28:25.227
That spell's a one-way door.

28:25.465 --> 28:26.946
It only goes backwards in time.

28:27.218 --> 28:29.176
He created a new spell
because of you.

28:29.431 --> 28:31.823
- One that works both ways.
- I'm touched.

28:32.104 --> 28:34.496
You should be. He's gone to
a lot of trouble to get you back.

28:34.817 --> 28:36.137
Yeah, I see that.

28:37.614 --> 28:39.447
You know, you don't have
to believe me, Chris,

28:39.702 --> 28:41.216
but this really is for the best.

28:41.497 --> 28:43.490
Oh, really? How's that?

28:43.793 --> 28:45.911
Because this is
your only chance to live.

28:46.172 --> 28:48.530
If I fail, he'll just keep sending
more assassins back

28:48.803 --> 28:51.035
and all they'll have
to bring home is a body.

28:51.809 --> 28:53.563
Doesn't matter.

28:54.855 --> 28:57.372
There's nothing left in the future
anymore anyway.

29:19.029 --> 29:20.588
It's time.

29:22.744 --> 29:25.580
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna leave you.

29:29.132 --> 29:30.566
Here.

29:31.052 --> 29:34.092
This will remind you
why we're doing this.

29:34.726 --> 29:36.047
And what's waiting for you here.

29:40.071 --> 29:43.111
Just make sure you take care
of the guards, okay?

29:43.953 --> 29:46.709
Then get out of here.
Because if he finds you,

29:47.042 --> 29:50.162
if he knows you betrayed him,
he'll kill you.

29:50.674 --> 29:52.347
Don't worry.

29:52.595 --> 29:54.268
I can take care of myself.

30:10.213 --> 30:14.450
<i>"I call upon the ancient power
To help us in this darkest hour</i>

30:14.847 --> 30:16.680
<i>Let the Book return to this place</i>

30:17.478 --> 30:20.074
<i>Claim refuge in its rightful space"</i>

30:24.282 --> 30:27.800
- It worked.
- The spell, find the spell.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.641
<i>"Hear these words, hear the rhyme</i>

30:34.009 --> 30:35.649
<i>Heed the hope within my mind</i>

30:35.888 --> 30:37.687
<i>Send me back to where I'll find</i>

30:37.933 --> 30:41.134
<i>What I wish, in place and time"</i>

30:52.629 --> 30:53.665
Bianca!

30:57.306 --> 30:58.900
Go! Go!

31:06.239 --> 31:08.596
You really expect me to
jump into this thing like before?

31:09.162 --> 31:10.677
Not without a fight, no.

31:14.255 --> 31:15.609
How can you be so cold?

31:16.719 --> 31:19.794
How can you stand and pretend like we
never meant anything to each other?

31:20.143 --> 31:21.703
I don't have a choice.

31:21.938 --> 31:24.408
Bianca, please don't do this.

31:25.235 --> 31:27.228
Don't give up on everything
that we fought for.

31:28.450 --> 31:29.440
I'm not.

31:30.037 --> 31:32.189
I'm just hoping
we can find another way.

31:35.297 --> 31:36.971
Ready?

31:41.100 --> 31:42.421
Hey, future girl!

31:49.866 --> 31:51.904
- You were saying?
- Wow, she is good.

31:54.209 --> 31:56.771
I can kill her in half the time
it takes you to think about it.

31:57.046 --> 31:58.720
We still have enough potion
to vanquish you.

31:58.967 --> 32:02.680
Maybe, but then you really will have
to hope the power of two will do.

32:03.016 --> 32:04.052
Won't you, Paige?

32:05.105 --> 32:07.860
Oh, you'd be surprised
what's in the history books.

32:08.153 --> 32:10.146
Now put the vials down slowly.

32:10.908 --> 32:13.505
Bianca, don't. Let her go
and I promise I'll go with you.

32:14.457 --> 32:15.686
Chris, what are you doing?

32:15.918 --> 32:20.075
If you kill her, there won't be a future
for us to go back to and you know it.

32:20.428 --> 32:23.309
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see if you live long enough.

32:24.978 --> 32:26.571
Piper, freeze them.

32:28.192 --> 32:30.834
Okay, I get why she didn't freeze,
but why didn't he freeze?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.028
- Unless he's a...
- I'm a witch too?

32:35.457 --> 32:36.493
That's right.

32:36.709 --> 32:40.707
Part witch, part whitelighter.
Just like you, Paige.

32:41.051 --> 32:43.328
- You lied to us?
- I had to.

32:43.598 --> 32:45.477
It was the only way
I could get you to trust me.

32:45.728 --> 32:47.048
Trust you?

32:47.271 --> 32:48.831
Never mind,
it doesn't matter anyway.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.627
So that's it, you're just gonna leave?

32:50.862 --> 32:52.012
I don't have a choice.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.518
She stripped my powers.

32:56.205 --> 32:58.243
Leo is gonna have to fix
that floorboard without me.

33:01.676 --> 33:03.269
Let's go.

33:22.216 --> 33:24.778
Welcome home, Chris.

33:37.537 --> 33:38.812
Hello, Wyatt.

33:45.344 --> 33:47.098
There's gotta be a spell
in here somewhere.

33:47.348 --> 33:49.068
To take us to the future?
I don't think so.

33:49.310 --> 33:52.669
Well, Bianca's a witch, she could do it,
how could she do it?

33:52.985 --> 33:54.180
We don't know how.

33:54.404 --> 33:55.919
How did we do it five years ago?

33:56.157 --> 33:57.591
The Elders made
that happen, remember?

33:57.827 --> 34:00.263
Well, you're an Elder,
make it happen.

34:00.541 --> 34:02.978
- That was a unique situation.
- This isn't?

34:03.254 --> 34:05.611
I don't like this either.
Don't you think I wanna save him?

34:05.885 --> 34:07.843
I don't know if I wanna save him
or kick his ass.

34:08.097 --> 34:11.058
That still doesn't change
all the good he's done.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.745
You're singing a different tune.
You've come a long way, baby.

34:14.025 --> 34:17.783
Okay, despite all his secrets,
I still believe that he came back

34:18.117 --> 34:21.157
to protect Wyatt and that is enough
for me to wanna save him.

34:21.456 --> 34:23.576
The question is how?

34:26.134 --> 34:27.853
- Leo.
- What?

34:28.094 --> 34:29.370
Fix the floorboard.

34:29.599 --> 34:31.351
Maybe he was trying
to tell us something.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.797
- Who? What?
- Maybe.

34:33.021 --> 34:38.054
Maybe that's where Bianca was
taking him. To the attic in the future.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.884
But that would still be there
in the future, wouldn't it?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.516
Yeah, unless we fixed it.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.869
Or used it to send him something,
something that he needed.

34:46.170 --> 34:49.565
- Like what?
- His powers.

35:04.499 --> 35:06.696
They're no threat to me.

35:09.134 --> 35:11.411
<i>Et tu, Chris?</i>

35:12.640 --> 35:14.200
Of all the people to betray me...

35:14.436 --> 35:16.349
I didn't go back to betray you, Wyatt.

35:16.607 --> 35:18.645
I went back to save you.

35:18.902 --> 35:21.294
Save me? From what?

35:21.616 --> 35:23.256
From whatever evil it was
that turned you.

35:23.745 --> 35:25.898
That's always been
your problem, Chris.

35:26.668 --> 35:30.062
Stuck in the old
good-versus-evil morass.

35:30.384 --> 35:31.944
I'm so past that.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.650
It's all about power,
it's as simple as that.

35:34.936 --> 35:37.737
And whoever has
the most power wins, is that it?

35:38.024 --> 35:39.538
That's it.

35:39.778 --> 35:42.340
That's why I keep
this museum intact.

35:42.867 --> 35:44.860
To remind everyone the power
from which I was born,

35:45.121 --> 35:46.602
and that which I possess.

35:46.834 --> 35:49.590
Too bad the rest of the city isn't faring
as well as your shrine here.

35:51.008 --> 35:55.130
You know, if anyone else tried what
you tried, I'd kill them on the spot.

35:55.474 --> 35:57.432
But you...

35:59.692 --> 36:01.365
I've forgiven Bianca,
I can forgive you too.

36:01.612 --> 36:04.652
If you promise
never to cross me again.

36:04.951 --> 36:06.067
You know me better than that.

36:06.287 --> 36:08.120
You said you could talk
some sense into him.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.411
Leave her out of this.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.107
Pardon me?

36:26.369 --> 36:30.525
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

36:33.675 --> 36:35.633
There you go.

36:39.604 --> 36:40.799
Okay, put it back.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.050
You promised you wouldn't hurt him!

36:45.281 --> 36:46.920
And you promised you'd turn him.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.394
Just like I turned you,
or at least I thought I had.

36:51.962 --> 36:53.794
Chris, please.

36:55.093 --> 36:56.493
I didn't bring you here to die.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.121
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

37:01.897 --> 37:03.377
I think.

37:06.949 --> 37:08.622
Have you lost your mind?

37:10.372 --> 37:14.051
I don't need you.

37:24.356 --> 37:26.189
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

37:26.444 --> 37:27.879
I can't hold him for long.

37:36.214 --> 37:38.367
<i>"Power of witches, rise
Come to me from across the skies</i>

37:38.636 --> 37:40.549
<i>Return my magic, give me back</i>

37:40.807 --> 37:43.324
<i>All that was taken from the attack"</i>

37:47.027 --> 37:48.621
No!

37:55.752 --> 37:58.633
Bianca. Bianca.

37:58.925 --> 38:00.883
No. No. No.

38:01.139 --> 38:02.858
Haven't we been here before?

38:04.896 --> 38:06.331
Maybe we will be again.

38:07.944 --> 38:09.902
Maybe.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.363
You can finish what we started.

38:22.138 --> 38:23.413
Hurry.

38:24.517 --> 38:26.714
Take the spell
so he can't send anyone else.

38:28.359 --> 38:30.158
Go.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.841
<i>"Hear these words, hear the rhyme</i>

<i>Send me back to where I'll find

38:48.607 --> 38:49.961
No!

38:55.746 --> 38:58.467
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:00.547 --> 39:01.583
Nice spell.

39:01.799 --> 39:04.076
Yeah, but we just put it in there,
like, two seconds ago.

39:04.346 --> 39:06.385
- The way time travel works...
- I don't wanna know,

39:06.684 --> 39:08.438
I already have
a little headache, thanks.

39:08.688 --> 39:11.603
You have some serious explaining
to do, young man.

39:12.570 --> 39:14.369
I know.

39:14.616 --> 39:17.816
Listen, I'm sorry I lied to you,
I really am, but...

39:18.123 --> 39:20.481
No, no buts, it's about time
you tell us the truth. Now.

39:22.006 --> 39:25.001
I can't.
But not because I don't want to.

39:25.304 --> 39:28.379
There's only so much I can tell without
the future being changed too much.

39:28.685 --> 39:31.760
Isn't that your whole point?
To come and change the future?

39:32.317 --> 39:35.437
Yeah, but that was supposed to be
more like a surgical strike.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.096
To save Wyatt.

39:38.246 --> 39:39.396
To save Wyatt.

39:40.626 --> 39:42.220
What about Bianca?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.877
Bianca won't be a threat
to anyone anymore.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.295
I'm sorry.

39:53.694 --> 39:54.810
Me too.

39:57.869 --> 39:59.667
So you still all right
with me hanging around?

40:06.218 --> 40:08.131
Absolutely.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.638
But the next time you're in trouble,
you tell us.

40:12.229 --> 40:13.664
Trust works both ways.

40:14.651 --> 40:16.005
Okay.

40:36.527 --> 40:39.043
If I can't save you,
I swear to God I'll stop you.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.490
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:57.402 --> 40:59.759
What's going on?

41:00.032 --> 41:02.629
Well, I've been thinking.

41:03.706 --> 41:05.266
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

41:07.630 --> 41:10.022
I think it's time we make
some changes around here.

41:14.686 --> 41:16.440
What kind of changes?

41:17.483 --> 41:20.762
Like I think you should move
to Hong Kong with Jason

41:22.034 --> 41:23.913
and you should move in
with Richard.

41:27.127 --> 41:28.847
I never said I wanted that.

41:30.174 --> 41:33.853
You didn't have to,
the spell did that for you. And you too.

41:37.814 --> 41:40.569
Well, we can't leave you alone.
We have to stick together.

41:40.862 --> 41:43.537
No, I know, believe me. I know.

41:43.826 --> 41:47.299
But you can't keep sacrificing
your lives forever.

41:47.626 --> 41:48.980
And neither can I.

41:49.880 --> 41:53.159
Mom did that, Grams did it,
and even Prue.

41:54.014 --> 41:55.972
And look what happened to them.

41:57.854 --> 41:59.574
It's not a legacy I want us to inherit.

42:00.777 --> 42:03.772
What if is doesn't work out,
us going our separate ways?

42:04.116 --> 42:06.792
Well, we'll worry about it then.

42:10.378 --> 42:11.858
You sure about this?

42:14.345 --> 42:16.018
Yeah, I am.
