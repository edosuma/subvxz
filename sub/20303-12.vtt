NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:04.629
According to ballistics,

00:04.713 --> 00:07.007
Miss Gilliam was shot
with a .45 automatic.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.259
Certain people in certain positions

00:09.342 --> 00:11.970
are already demanding
a quick and easy solution.

00:13.013 --> 00:13.972
Hold it right there!

00:14.055 --> 00:16.391
I'm scared, Frank. I'm really scared.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.434
We'll get him, Joyce.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.977
I promise you.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.603
(screaming)

00:20.687 --> 00:22.397
Put it down. Put it down!

00:22.480 --> 00:23.481
(screams)

00:23.565 --> 00:26.026
Big-time dope expert, huh, Crimmons?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.569
I thought you told me this guy was okay!

00:27.861 --> 00:30.071
I didn't know, Mr. Goldberg--
I thought he was cool!

00:30.655 --> 00:33.533
(growling)

00:35.577 --> 00:37.954
(suspenseful music playing)

00:57.766 --> 00:59.517
(indistinct chatter on police radio)

01:01.728 --> 01:03.229
RAY: Frank, it's terrible.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.607
Let me have a look.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.613
The ID is still tentative.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.240
I can't be the one to make it positive,
but I think so.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.202
RAY: How well did you know her, Frank?

01:17.285 --> 01:19.579
Just casually.
Did she resist her assailant?

01:19.829 --> 01:20.997
No witnesses.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.250
Seems to me like she and her companion
were nailed coming through the door.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.376
Kill and rob.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.254
-Her companion?
-RAY: George Hobart.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.841
We got him outta here a minute ago
in critical condition.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
A young male was seen running to a car.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.138
Flashy jacket, maybe gang colors.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.140
Nobody got a license or a make.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.893
I want Howard Hunter in my office
first thing in the morning.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.103
RAY: All right.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.315
-Does she have family here, Frank?
-No-- I-- I don't know.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.775
She was from out of state.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.318
Who do we call for an ID?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.071
I know a close friend.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.341
Joyce? Yeah.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.094
(stammers) Listen.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.720
I have some bad news.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.351
ESTERHAUS:<i> Item eight...</i>

02:25.687 --> 02:27.689
We had a bad one last night, people.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.902
Pamela Gilliam was shot to death
in an attempted robbery

02:33.695 --> 02:36.447
outside a neighborhood restaurant
on Jefferson.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.576
Her companion was critically wounded.

02:39.659 --> 02:44.706
Some of you may have known Miss Gilliam
in her capacity as a public defender.

02:44.789 --> 02:48.626
Others, in her private work
with young offenders.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.255
For those of you who didn't,
suffice it to say,

02:52.338 --> 02:54.340
we've all suffered a grievous loss.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.468
As part of a subsequent operation,

02:57.552 --> 03:00.430
the, uh, captain
would like the following teams

03:00.513 --> 03:02.056
to remain after roll call--

03:02.390 --> 03:05.685
Bates/Coffey, Shorcoff/Walsh,
Prentice/Milatello.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.313
(clears throat) Item nine,

03:08.646 --> 03:10.064
it appears that, um,

03:11.232 --> 03:13.985
congratulations
are in order for one of us. Uh...

03:15.028 --> 03:17.655
late yesterday afternoon,
the Black Police Officers' Coalition

03:17.739 --> 03:19.741
met to elect its annual congress.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.660
Officer Hill,
conspicuous by his non-presence,

03:22.744 --> 03:25.663
was nominated vice-president in absentia

03:25.747 --> 03:28.875
by Lieutenant Ozzie Cleveland of Midtown,

03:28.958 --> 03:31.920
and dually elected by a convincing margin!

03:32.003 --> 03:34.047
(cheering and applause)

03:35.506 --> 03:37.425
I, for one, am certain Officer Hill

03:37.508 --> 03:41.638
will contribute magnificently
to the new administration,

03:42.263 --> 03:45.934
and stand as a sterling example
of Hill Street fortitude and diplomacy

03:46.017 --> 03:48.895
race-wise, police-wise, and otherwise.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.398
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.775
And, hey! Hey!

03:54.692 --> 03:58.279
Let's be<i> real, real </i>careful out there.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.787
This must be some kind of damn mistake.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.331
I don't want to run for any
vice-president. I wasn't even there!

04:08.414 --> 04:11.417
What the hell is Ozzie--
What's the number of Midtown?

04:11.501 --> 04:12.877
It's written on the wall there.

04:13.544 --> 04:17.131
You know, I was elected sergeant-at-arms
in high school one time.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.217
Punched out two other guys to get that.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.802
Okay, Renko.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.804
Uh, Lieutenant Cleveland?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.681
Hey, I want to report 57 people

04:24.764 --> 04:26.557
being held hostage
in an apartment building.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.977
-57? Where?
-Yes, sir. 2642 Richmond.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.479
A guy named Sosa and his two goon sons
are responsible.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.314
-Are they armed?
-Yeah, you could say that.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.983
He's got the title to the building.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.652
I don't understand, sir.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.655
Well, it's simple. You buy yourself
a rent-controlled building

04:40.738 --> 04:42.407
with people who have a fixed income.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.367
Then you gotta get them out
to jack up the price,

04:44.450 --> 04:45.618
so you let the furnace break down,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.912
the toilets back up,
and you let the rats run free.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.372
And you do cute little things,

04:49.455 --> 04:51.958
like put glue in the mailbox
so nobody can get in there.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.751
And then if you complain,
he tells the tenants,

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086
"If you don't like it, take a walk."

04:55.753 --> 04:57.797
Do you live at this address, Mister, um...

04:57.880 --> 05:00.216
Bustamante, Joe. Yeah, we're new tenants.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.677
You report any of this
to the Department of Buildings?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.514
What, are you kidding? So they can condemn
the building? Then what?

05:06.597 --> 05:09.100
Now, Mr. Bustamante,
soon as I can free somebody,

05:09.183 --> 05:10.727
I'll have the matter investigated.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.855
Leave the information
with the Khaki Officer. Thank you.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.607
Mr. Bustamante, I'm not entirely clear

05:16.691 --> 05:19.277
as to the criminal nature
of whatever it is.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.531
Harassment, 140.25.
Criminal mischief, 140.40.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.491
Penal code class C misdemeanors.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.327
I'm a law student.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.704
Don't look so impressed.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.748
We'll do our best, Mr. Bustamante.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.207
I tell you, the guy's crazy!

05:33.291 --> 05:35.668
(man screaming)

05:43.968 --> 05:47.722
No! You're not gonna get me! No!

05:53.394 --> 05:54.437
MAN: Come on, stay back, now!

06:01.986 --> 06:03.154
Put it down. Put it down!

06:05.198 --> 06:06.282
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:08.910 --> 06:13.456
You'll never get me! You'll never get me!
You'll never get me!

06:13.539 --> 06:15.083
No! No!

06:15.166 --> 06:20.963
No! No! You'll never get me! No! No!

06:21.297 --> 06:22.298
(growling)

06:26.844 --> 06:29.514
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:29.597 --> 06:31.391
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:31.474 --> 06:35.144
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:37.021
(sirens wailing)

06:42.485 --> 06:46.406
(theme music playing)

07:47.300 --> 07:50.094
It's unfortunate,
but a lot of cheap-shot politics

07:50.178 --> 07:51.554
are gonna come out of this one.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.059
She was Black, and she was prominent.
She comes from a highly respected family.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.313
Certain people in certain positions

08:00.396 --> 08:03.107
are already demanding
a quick and easy solution.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.903
I don't need to tell you
who's expected to get it for them.

08:07.111 --> 08:07.945
(chalk squeaks)

08:09.906 --> 08:12.450
Damn calcium carbonate impurities!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.040
According to ballistics,

08:19.123 --> 08:21.501
Miss Gilliam was shot
with a .45 automatic.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.044
That's an expensive piece for a kid,

08:23.127 --> 08:25.213
so the killer's likely
to try to hold onto it.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.632
Somebody saw gang colors at the scene.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.343
Inasmuch as it's Royal Blood turf,

08:30.426 --> 08:32.929
we figure
their Hodge Street playground hangout

08:33.012 --> 08:34.597
is as good a place as any to start.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.350
The D.A. says we can sweep it,

08:37.683 --> 08:40.269
ask questions, conduct a stop-and-frisk.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.356
If the gun's in the park,
we're gonna find it.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.358
Captain, how hard can we pat 'em down?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.860
If it's hard enough to dent a skull,
pull it.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.863
Our right to frisk in this instance

08:50.947 --> 08:54.367
extends only so far
as protective necessity,

08:54.450 --> 08:56.202
so let's try to keep it clean, okay?

08:57.119 --> 08:58.079
If we do find any evidence,

08:58.162 --> 09:00.248
we don't want it
kicked back on a technicality.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.461
Lieutenant Hunter
will fill you in on the specifics.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
Thank you, Captain. (clears throat)

09:10.132 --> 09:12.093
It's a joint operation, people.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.720
Emergency Action Team and regular forces

09:14.804 --> 09:18.224
working in unison
to achieve a maximum tactical effect.

09:18.599 --> 09:22.228
Our objective
is the Hodge Street playground.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.355
Now, this is a formidable playground,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.608
but by no means an impregnable one.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.738
I plan to deploy you much in the same way
Hannibal deployed his Nubians

09:32.822 --> 09:35.491
when taking the sea wall at Syracuse.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.625
We have 20 Uniforms and detectives now.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.752
We'll have five more by this afternoon.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.215
You want miracle results,
get me a miracle budget!

09:54.802 --> 09:58.222
<i>Tell me, how do you reconcile your job</i>
<i>with your own personal gut feeling</i>

09:58.306 --> 09:59.974
<i>that crime should be punished?</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:02.435
<i>Sometimes, it isn't easy.</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:05.521
<i>Doubts concerning one's client</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:07.982
<i>are inevitable for any public defender.</i>

10:08.316 --> 10:12.945
<i>I'm sure any D.A. has parallel doubts</i>
<i>about witnesses, police officers.</i>

10:13.529 --> 10:16.240
<i>Fortunately, we've got a judicial system</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:19.785
<i>which leaves the ultimate judgment</i>
<i>up to a jury of one's peers.</i>

10:20.161 --> 10:23.664
<i>My role as a public defender</i>
<i>is simply to facilitate that process</i>

10:23.748 --> 10:27.501
<i>by giving my clients</i>
<i>the best possible defense the law allows.</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:30.880
<i>I do have occasional doubts about my job,</i>

10:31.589 --> 10:32.465
<i>but all in all,</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:34.175
<i>I believe in this clumsy,</i>

10:34.258 --> 10:35.551
<i>-overloaded system.</i>
-Henry.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.560
We're working on it, Joyce.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.408
(voice shaking) I hardly recognized her
down at the coroner's, Frank. (gasps)

11:10.336 --> 11:12.755
Her hair was all tangled. (sniffles)

11:13.547 --> 11:14.965
Isn't that crazy? Huh.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.176
(sniffles) That's what got to me most.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.430
She was always so meticulous about it.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.059
You ever wished you'd been there
when it happened, with a gun?

11:25.142 --> 11:25.976
(sniffles)

11:32.274 --> 11:35.695
We live in the freest,
most secure society in the world,

11:36.946 --> 11:38.614
and you can get blown away...

11:39.740 --> 11:40.866
just because...

11:42.201 --> 11:44.995
you just happen to leave a restaurant
at the wrong time.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.374
What's happening in this country?

11:50.167 --> 11:52.962
Listen to me,
the crusading public defender.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.007
What if the animal who did this

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
is somebody I helped put
back on the streets

12:00.052 --> 12:02.096
because of some legal technicality?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.062
How's Hobart?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.857
Out of surgery, that's all I know.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.654
I'm scared, Frank. I'm really scared.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.449
We'll get him, Joyce.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.160
I promise you.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.247
I'd like to stay here for a little while,
if I could.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.001
Sure.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.044
Stay as long as you want.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.844
(door opens)

12:42.428 --> 12:43.262
(sniffles)

12:44.472 --> 12:47.850
(sobbing)

12:52.396 --> 12:54.440
What are you doing to me, Ozzie?
I didn't ask for this post.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.109
Hell, I didn't even know I was nominated
till two hours ago.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.862
All I did was throw your hat
in the ring, Bobby.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.364
It's not my fault you came up a winner.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.159
I got other interests
in my life right now, Ozzie.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.495
I don't want to be active in politics!

13:08.078 --> 13:11.457
Ozzie, it's not like I don't support
the goals of the Coalition, it's just--

13:12.917 --> 13:15.711
Ozzie, I would make
a lousy vice-president anyway.

13:15.920 --> 13:20.424
Well, it appears that 284 of your fellow
Black officers feel differently.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.510
Well, seeing as how I got in
on your coattails,

13:22.593 --> 13:25.429
I'd say that's more a testament
to your popularity than mine.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.680
You're wrong, Bobby.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.350
Sure, I endorsed you,
quite strongly, in fact.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.394
But in the end result,
it was you they voted for.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.567
Ozzie, you just gonna have
to find yourself another man.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.111
I know, Bobby.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.405
I felt the same way
when I was first nominated

13:43.489 --> 13:45.324
to the presidency six years ago.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.495
Why make waves? Maybe a few enemies.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.414
There's always some other guy
who'll take up the slack.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.710
But let me tell you something--

13:58.587 --> 14:00.089
if every one of us
had copped the same attitude,

14:00.172 --> 14:02.299
there wouldn't be a coalition
in the first place,

14:02.383 --> 14:05.052
in which case, I seriously doubt
you'd be standing there

14:05.135 --> 14:07.263
-in that uniform right now.
-Wait a minute, Ozzie.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.139
I may owe you guys a few back dues,

14:09.223 --> 14:12.852
but these Blues are bought and paid for
with more than just my money.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.437
Do you have any idea
how many Blacks were on the job

14:15.521 --> 14:17.606
before the Coalition was founded
18 years ago?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.025
-No, I--
-Twenty four in the entire city!

14:20.109 --> 14:22.152
Within four years
of our quota-hiring proposal,

14:22.236 --> 14:24.321
that figure jumped to 180.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.407
-Ozzie, don't get m--
-And that is just the beginning.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.783
Do you realize

14:27.992 --> 14:30.828
that in the present
Black enrollment of 384,

14:30.911 --> 14:35.207
there are only three ranking officers
in the whole department? Three!

14:35.624 --> 14:36.667
Hill Street has none...

14:38.586 --> 14:40.462
but we are bringing that up to quota, too.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.218
We could use you, Bobby.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.306
But if you don't want the responsibility,
I understand.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.940
I just thought you should know
who your friends are.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.871
Oh, right this way, Mr. Simms.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.374
Mr. Goldberg has been
one of our leading manufacturers

15:17.458 --> 15:20.169
of ladies' apparel
for the past ten years now.

15:20.586 --> 15:25.382
Our blouson has been featured
in<i> Cosmo </i>magazine last month.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.801
I bet the coolers
got a big bang out of that.

15:32.556 --> 15:36.435
So what, Sidney? Fourteen percent
of nothing is still nothing.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.230
Hey, you can burn 'em
in the street for all I care.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.692
I wouldn't wrap a sick dog
in those<i> shmattes.</i>

15:46.153 --> 15:46.987
It's Rozniak.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.282
He's trying to unload
5,000 yards of flip rayon on me.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.534
You ever try to work with Filipino rayon?

15:52.618 --> 15:53.953
I can't say that I have.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.288
This is Eddie Simms, Mr. Goldberg,

15:56.580 --> 15:57.998
the fellow I was telling you about.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.085
Hey, hey, terrific.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.962
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.424
You, uh, bring
the party supplies, or what?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.510
No, actually, Mr. Goldberg,

16:09.593 --> 16:11.845
I was here to discuss
a profit-sharing plan

16:11.929 --> 16:13.305
for your employees out front.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.018
(all laughing)

16:18.769 --> 16:21.605
Good, that's very, very good.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.107
I like this guy already.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.442
Hey, and you can stop
that "Mr. Goldberg" crap.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.069
Eddie, my name is Stan, huh?

16:27.152 --> 16:30.489
Stan, feast your eyes on this.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.700
(whistles)

16:33.158 --> 16:35.452
Stuff this pure a lot of dudes
would have jumped on

16:35.536 --> 16:37.037
with everything but hiking boots.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.708
Hasn't been touched
by human hands since Bogota.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.876
You mind if I run this up the flagpole?

16:42.960 --> 16:43.836
Be my guest.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.220
-If you don't mind my asking, Stan...
-Hmm?

16:53.554 --> 16:57.224
...what is a big-time garment
manufacturer like yourself

16:57.933 --> 17:01.645
doing buying eight ounces
of Columbian flake?

17:01.729 --> 17:04.648
(scoffs) I got a 19-year-old wife.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.775
She goes through this stuff
like breath mints.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.152
And her friends... (chuckles)

17:08.652 --> 17:11.530
My place is like a regular convention
on weekends.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.200
First-rate, Mr. Goldberg. First-rate.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.246
Uh, how much you say this was?

17:19.913 --> 17:23.375
Eight ounces-- $2,250 per. 18-grand even.

17:24.835 --> 17:25.669
(tongue clicks)

17:32.926 --> 17:35.262
On second thought,
why don't you just empty the safe?

17:36.889 --> 17:40.225
-What the hell is this?
-EDDIE: It's called a rip-off, Stan.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.228
Let's go. In the briefcase. Move!

17:43.312 --> 17:45.606
Big-time dope expert, huh, Crimmons?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.399
I thought you told me this guy was okay!

17:47.483 --> 17:49.610
I didn't know, Mr. Goldberg.
I thought he was cool!

17:49.693 --> 17:51.528
Yeah, well, you're fired.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.155
You hear me? You're through!

17:53.530 --> 17:54.782
When I get done with you,

17:54.865 --> 17:57.576
you won't be able to get a job
as a seamstress!

18:02.581 --> 18:04.124
Nice doing business with you, lovers.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
Feeling's mutual, cupcake.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.762
(grunts)

18:19.431 --> 18:20.474
Hey, you cool, baby?

18:20.891 --> 18:23.018
No sweat, Cal. Belker's down there.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.940
(growling)

18:31.610 --> 18:33.737
(siren wails)

18:45.666 --> 18:47.251
(clamoring)

18:56.301 --> 18:59.429
Come, my pan-faced children.
Follow well in order.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.764
Get your weapons ready.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.225
Have you your pistols?

19:04.143 --> 19:07.813
Have you your sharp-edged axes, pioneers?

19:09.231 --> 19:11.108
Oh, pioneers.

19:12.985 --> 19:13.986
(sighs)

19:15.070 --> 19:17.906
Judging from the literacy rate
at this corner of the globe,

19:17.990 --> 19:20.159
I doubt they'd recognize Walt Whitman

19:20.242 --> 19:21.952
if he fell in their (indistinct).

19:25.789 --> 19:26.957
This is bogus, man.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.626
Every time something happens,
you come down here and you jump on us.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.712
Whoa, do you believe this?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.672
Why don't you stuff it?
I'm studying to be a dentist.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.340
(whirring)

19:36.216 --> 19:37.134
This is madness.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.261
They got murders uptown, man,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.805
but I don't see you
frisking the stock exchange.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.223
Yeah, well, how many brokers do you know

19:43.307 --> 19:46.226
who hold up their pants
with a Harley-Davidson primary chain?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.311
-It's a look.
-MAN: Come on, now,

19:47.394 --> 19:48.228
you're breaking my arm.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.647
Be nice, this is no picnic for us, either.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.690
Is this a look, too?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.567
Come on, come on.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
Come on.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.695
Webster?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.781
If that's your mama, tell her
she hurt my back<i> bad </i>last night.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.366
Bring in the backup transport.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.160
It's starting to look like
the NBA playoffs here.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.662
Only queens tuck trousers
in their boots, chief.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.374
Any .45 automatics in there, Coffey?

20:09.625 --> 20:10.834
No, sir, just the usual.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.587
Saturday Night Specials,
flare guns, stuff like that.

20:13.670 --> 20:14.504
Hmm.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.466
(indistinct chatter)

20:20.510 --> 20:23.513
It's the Walther PPK of the methadone set.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.807
Judas H.!

20:26.725 --> 20:28.435
These people have
about as much appreciation

20:28.518 --> 20:30.896
for small arms weaponry
as a Marseilles pimp.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.030
HUNTER (over megaphone):
<i>Stay right where you are there, young man.</i>

20:41.823 --> 20:44.618
Would you please retrieve
that person, Coffey?

20:44.868 --> 20:45.702
Yes, sir.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.006
(engine turns over)

20:58.090 --> 20:59.591
Turn it off! Turn it off!

21:00.676 --> 21:01.510
Get out of the car.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.068
HUNTER: What have we here?

21:18.652 --> 21:21.113
My goodness, a Caribbean toothpick.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.322
-Ooh.
-Whew!

21:24.157 --> 21:25.617
I imagine we'd be making a big mistake

21:25.701 --> 21:27.828
if we didn't arrest this felon,
hey, Ballentine?

21:27.911 --> 21:30.414
-I'll pop the trunk, sir.
-No, no, no. Stay right there.

21:30.497 --> 21:34.751
This one we'll tow directly
to Impound and search it there.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.212
-Say what?
-"Say what," yeah.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.756
That's impound procedure, Ty.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.260
You wouldn't want us
to leave all your worldly goods

21:43.343 --> 21:46.555
in a garage overnight
without a proper inventory?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.141
Come on.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.811
(knife opens and closes)

21:52.894 --> 21:54.771
-"Say what."
-"Say what."

21:55.105 --> 21:56.648
What is this world coming to?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.985
The departmental lot
was bumper-to-bumper, Frank,

22:00.068 --> 22:01.695
per usual, I might add.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.405
We were therefore compelled to use

22:03.488 --> 22:08.744
the licensed impound facility
of one, uh, Barnard T. Kaczmarek.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.121
Fine, Howard, just so long
as it's by the book.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.666
Schmeltzer is just emerging
from the rear of the vehicle

22:14.750 --> 22:17.127
even as we speak, Frank,
with what appears to be--

22:17.210 --> 22:18.211
Schmeltzer, come here.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.049
...a set of bongos, a baseball bat.

22:22.799 --> 22:26.762
Ah! Two sharpened Afro-American combs.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.555
Spare me the play-by-play, Howard.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.973
Just phone me here at the station

22:30.057 --> 22:31.975
if you find anything
the least bit relevant.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.855
BALLENTINE: Looks like a department store
in here, sir.

22:40.984 --> 22:41.902
Kudos, Ballentine,

22:41.985 --> 22:44.112
but it's not the least bit relevant
to the matter at hand.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.947
Are there any small arms in there?

22:46.239 --> 22:47.532
There doesn't appear to be.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.494
Just radios and tape decks and the like.

22:51.161 --> 22:54.122
Well, let's check
the spare tire well, shall we?

23:02.631 --> 23:03.840
Good call, sir.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.718
Three .45s, automatic.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.265
Get 'em down to Ballistics posthaste,
Ballentine.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.645
If we get lucky, I'll let you ride point
on the next maneuver.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.607
(indistinct chatter)

23:26.988 --> 23:30.200
Darlin', Renko.
Two sandwiches, two coffees.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.284
What do you got there?

23:31.618 --> 23:32.494
LUCY: Cherries jubilee.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.454
-Mm.
-Yo, Hill!

23:35.288 --> 23:36.998
Think you could sit with the brothers?

23:37.082 --> 23:38.750
We got a few matters to get straight.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.254
Uh, yeah, yeah. I can-- I can do that.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.132
Say, Renko, I'm gonna go
and sit with the brothers for...

23:45.966 --> 23:46.800
No problem.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.343
-Yep.
-Yep.

23:49.803 --> 23:53.515
Well, it's not that I'm denying
the Afro-Americans

23:53.598 --> 23:55.684
their inalienable right

23:55.767 --> 23:58.311
to gather and converse
about their problems

23:58.395 --> 24:01.815
to bring themselves
out of the poisonous oppression

24:01.898 --> 24:03.650
they have endured for these many years,

24:03.733 --> 24:06.736
but I have been eating lunch with that guy

24:06.820 --> 24:08.321
for three and a half years.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.157
Well, you're just gonna
have to cool it, Renko,

24:10.240 --> 24:12.492
because you are married
to a politician now.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.538
In 1965, we had 7/10ths
of one percent brothers

24:16.621 --> 24:18.206
at Detective Two or above.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.667
1973, 5.2.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.961
This year, we're down to 4.8.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.213
Hey, Vernon,
I'm not arguing your numbers, man.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.467
I'm just saying that before we start
issuing ultimatums,

24:28.550 --> 24:30.385
we better make sure we can back them up.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.181
You know why you got elected, bro?

24:35.599 --> 24:39.102
Because Ozzie Cleveland knew
that you don't offend people.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.314
Well, I<i> want </i>to offend people.
I don't care about eating lunch with them.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.065
Just give me what's mine, Jack.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.275
Okay, Bobby, let's go.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.027
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.614
Uh, this is Vernon Lee,
one of the founders of the B.O.C.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.240
This is my partner, Andy Renko.

24:52.949 --> 24:53.950
What's happening, bro?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.789
(laughter)

25:03.502 --> 25:04.336
You coming?

25:05.962 --> 25:09.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just want to talk to the guys awhile.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.467
You want to pick me back up?

25:11.885 --> 25:14.262
Old European tradition, to shake a hand.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.890
Never knew there was much improvement
needed on it.

25:22.938 --> 25:23.772
Whoa.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.316
There's a fascinating article
in here titled

25:26.399 --> 25:29.778
"Castration By Design,"
about our Panama Canal fiasco.

25:31.029 --> 25:35.617
You realize we may as well
have given Cleveland to the Russians.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.452
What would be so bad about that?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.970
-Have you got something alive--
-I got a pet mouse.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.603
You know, I remember in Da Nang,
we had a pet Komodo Lizard.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.981
We kept it near the interrogation room.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.025
Ate an entire chicken once.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.114
I notice you're fond of fauna.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.241
I love animals, Lieutenant.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.243
They're loyal, they're reliable--

26:18.535 --> 26:21.288
I think they're much more giving
of affection than humankind.

26:22.789 --> 26:23.873
He's cute, isn't he?

26:26.626 --> 26:29.713
Ooh, you like smoked fish head,
you little guy.

26:30.338 --> 26:33.133
(high-pitched voice) Gotta eat
your protein, grow very, very big.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.801
Very, very good for you.

26:35.927 --> 26:36.970
His name's Mickey.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.682
-Fascinating creatures, rodents.
-Yeah.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.646
Indeed, there's some
top-drawer research now

26:46.730 --> 26:50.108
that indicates that mice
in confined spaces

26:50.191 --> 26:52.694
exhibit the same kind
of sociopathic disorder

26:52.777 --> 26:55.322
that you find
in your Third-World brown types.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.574
Not this little fella, Lieutenant.

26:58.283 --> 27:02.537
Have you ever noticed how some dogs
immediately take to fire engines?

27:03.330 --> 27:06.291
Well, this little guy's
got a real talent for police work.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.959
I met him on a stakeout.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.879
Just the two of us
up in an attic alone for nine hours.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.840
The whole time this little guy
never made a peep.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.387
Fascinating. Simply fascinating.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.305
Mm-hmm.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.516
A symbiotic relationship.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.936
I'm training him to sniff out drugs.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.438
You know, marijuana, cocaine.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.900
I think I gave him
a little too much last night.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.151
He really got wiped out.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.278
Didn't want to come to work this morning.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.530
(chuckles)

27:41.326 --> 27:42.952
-His name's Mickey?
-Yeah.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.664
Mouse?

27:46.122 --> 27:48.124
Not Mickey Mouse, Mickey<i> Belker.</i>

27:49.042 --> 27:52.379
I tell you, Lieutenant,
I just love this little guy.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.799
Hey, Mick! Great collar today.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.347
(whimpers)

28:10.855 --> 28:13.149
(growling)

28:15.443 --> 28:17.570
(man laughing)

28:18.988 --> 28:21.950
So, listen, they call my Caddy
"The Yom Kippur clipper."

28:22.325 --> 28:24.994
Not only stops on a dime,
gets out, goes, picks it up.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.163
(laughter)

28:28.998 --> 28:30.500
-Hi, Henry.
-Fay.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.711
Hey.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.295
See those guys?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.882
We're talking bargain basement
of the legal profession.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.635
They're still making 60-grand,
hitting Aruba twice a winter.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.013
I'm as smart as they are,
I work twice as hard,

28:44.264 --> 28:46.599
and I take my life in my hands
every day I come to work.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.810
Shoulda listened to your mother
and gone to law school, Henry.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.353
Hey, I thought you guys were gonna help.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.772
-We been a little bit busy.
-You're a little bit late.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.816
Miss Keitel sends her regards
from the hospital.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.485
It seems she fell down and broke her hip.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.903
The banister collapsed.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.155
Oh, brother.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.453
Hey, by the way, for your information,
I talked to Sosa.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.871
You know what he said to me?

29:07.954 --> 29:09.789
It's not only 73-year olds
who can break a hip.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.041
It can happen to me, too,
if I'm not too careful.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.711
Oh, I completely forgot.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.964
Me, too. I'll go over there.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.884
There's a major, uh... (sniffs)

29:20.967 --> 29:23.428
"snowfall" in the garment district
every day, gentlemen.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.222
Uh-huh. And your client wants
to help with the cleanup.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.308
Very civic-minded of him, counselor.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.978
Well, let's just say that Mr. Simms is

29:32.645 --> 29:35.899
privy to a great amount of information...

29:36.691 --> 29:41.738
which with the appropriate promises,
assurances...

29:45.283 --> 29:47.410
We'll have to talk to our captain,
Mr. Wachtel.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.754
(door opens, closes)

29:58.838 --> 30:00.840
MAN: This little Jewish guy
gets hit by a car, right?

30:00.924 --> 30:03.176
Ambulance is coming,
people crowding all around.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.552
It doesn't look good for him.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.431
Now, this Irish cop comes over,
puts a blanket on top of him,

30:08.515 --> 30:09.766
balls up a jacket,

30:09.849 --> 30:13.770
puts it under his head, and says to him,
"Are you comfortable?" Right? (chuckles)

30:13.853 --> 30:16.856
Little Jewish guy opens up his eyes,
looks at him, and says,

30:17.065 --> 30:19.400
(in Jewish accent)
"I make a nice living, thank you."

30:19.484 --> 30:21.152
(laughing)

30:21.861 --> 30:22.946
Hey, answer me this.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.907
You guys do anything for your $80 an hour?

30:26.950 --> 30:27.784
Anything?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.789
It's a disgrace
and an embarrassment, Frank.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.041
I mean, here I am,
the newest member of W.A.D.,

30:35.124 --> 30:39.587
and my own ex-husband's precinct
hasn't got a single ranking Black officer.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.090
-W.A.D.?
-Women Against Discrimination.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.300
-It's Midge Dolson's group.
-Midge Dolson the lesbian?

30:44.384 --> 30:45.718
Oh, Frank!

30:45.802 --> 30:47.595
That hasn't got anything to do with it.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.931
I just mean she's a radical activist.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.184
She is an angry, concerned citizen
of the community.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.436
When I read about her and her W.A.D.,

30:55.520 --> 30:57.105
I went right over there to join up.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.149
Oh, Fay.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.150
Just because you've had

31:01.234 --> 31:03.611
some disappointments
with the men in your life...

31:05.363 --> 31:07.448
Well, I'm not planning
to become a lesbian,

31:07.532 --> 31:08.783
if that's what you're thinking.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.743
And I'm certainly
not going to burn my bra.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.703
That's a relief.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.373
Frank, I came here to warn you,
that's all.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.792
We are a wraparound support group.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.254
And Midge wants us to come out strongly
for the Black Officers' Coalition.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.549
In view of this precinct's
abysmal lack of Black equality,

31:24.632 --> 31:26.092
you're gonna get a lot of steam from us.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.802
Fay, appointments come up
through the department.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.178
I don't hire or fire anyone.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.555
(knock on door)

31:31.806 --> 31:32.640
Excuse me, Captain.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.517
Our suspect's lawyer's
interested in a deal.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.227
Why don't you ask him
what he thinks about it?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.187
Fay, please. What are they offering?

31:38.271 --> 31:39.397
They didn't get specific.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.941
Well, tell him
we'll have to talk to the D.A.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.776
You wanna try to pin him down
before I make the call?

31:43.860 --> 31:45.236
You wanna talk to him now?
He's right out here.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.323
Oh, it's all right. I gotta go.

31:50.116 --> 31:50.950
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.745
So, Frank, don't say I didn't warn you.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.039
Oh, by the way,
I'd love for you to meet Midge,

31:56.122 --> 31:57.373
she's<i> wonderful.</i>

32:03.504 --> 32:05.590
Wouldn't mind
a one-night stand with that, huh?

32:06.382 --> 32:07.300
Nice pillows.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.970
Ballistics for you, Frank, on 1-9.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.432
-Furillo.
-MAN:<i> Captain Furillo?</i>

32:14.515 --> 32:16.309
-Yes.
<i>-We got your .45.</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:18.186
Yeah, thanks.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.316
We have the gun that killed Pam Gilliam.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.777
Based on the evidence, counselor,

32:25.860 --> 32:29.113
we're prepared to press first-degree
murder charges against your client.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.240
My client here, Mr. Bragg,

32:31.574 --> 32:34.410
maintains he knows nothing
about the shooting of Miss Gilliam.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.038
Mr. Bragg can maintain all he wants.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.166
The fact remains the murder weapon
was found in the trunk of his car.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.709
So, unless he has something to add,

32:41.793 --> 32:43.920
we're prepared to turn him over
for arraignment.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.800
(whispering)
Do everything I tell you to do.

32:52.470 --> 32:56.766
Uh, my client, Mr. Bragg here,

32:57.517 --> 33:00.353
informs me he<i> may have </i>some things to say.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.482
But we've gotta stop talking
about Murder One, Captain.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.609
I can't promise you anything.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.990
But if he wants to tell us
who his accomplice was,

33:12.073 --> 33:13.408
maybe we can work something out.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.369
Assistant D.A. Zeiger's
in the next room on another matter.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.746
Why don't you two talk it over
while I get with him?

33:55.992 --> 33:56.826
(man coughing)

33:58.619 --> 33:59.620
(woman coughing)

34:02.832 --> 34:04.250
(man coughing)

34:40.661 --> 34:41.496
MAN: Who is it?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.165
Sergeant Goldblume from Hill Street.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.961
Listen, I did my bit.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.756
You're the people
that are supposed to do something.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.591
I got a wife. I gotta study.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.761
Hey-- Look, I just wanna run down

34:56.844 --> 34:59.097
a few of the allegations
before I talk to Mr. Sosa,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.265
or at least get the names
of the harassed tenants.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.267
I wish you wouldn't
have knocked on my door.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.770
Mr. Bustamante, this was your complaint.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.357
Well, I'm sorry. I've already
wasted half my day on this.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.234
Hey, I'm the middle of exams. Thanks.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.613
What's your problem?

35:17.532 --> 35:19.408
I'm looking for a Mr. Sosa.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.869
We're all Sosa. What do you want?

35:22.787 --> 35:25.748
I'm Sergeant Henry Goldblume,
Hill Street station.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.834
We've received some complaints
about the building,

35:27.917 --> 35:30.336
and I was hoping
maybe we could talk for a few minutes.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.464
Talk? About what? (scoffs)

35:33.756 --> 35:35.174
Talk to my lawyers.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.593
Who's complaining, anyways?

35:38.594 --> 35:41.514
Mr. Sosa, I been in here
less than five minutes.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.016
I already seen
at least eight code violations.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.561
A woman was seriously injured here today.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.604
You got a warrant?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.525
No warrant? Get out of here. Beat it.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.443
I don't need a warrant
to be in a public hallway.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.737
What, are you making the rules up
as you go?

35:58.656 --> 35:59.949
This is my building.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.869
My hallway, my tenants. Beat it!

36:03.703 --> 36:05.329
Take a good look at that, gentlemen.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.416
Now, it may still be possible
to settle this

36:08.499 --> 36:09.917
without a criminal prosecution.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.339
You're bluffing.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.675
You ain't got nothing.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.182
Excuse me.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.936
Next time, wise guy, call my lawyers!

36:37.904 --> 36:39.530
Can I give you some help with those?

36:41.157 --> 36:43.743
Ma'am, I'm a police officer.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.663
I'd like to talk to you
about conditions in this building.

36:47.955 --> 36:50.416
Don't you worry
about anything, sweet stuff.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.294
Pete here will give you a hand.

37:14.607 --> 37:17.777
Mr. Simms is not totally
out of touch with reality, gentlemen,

37:17.860 --> 37:21.948
and he feels as you do
that his interests will best be served

37:22.031 --> 37:23.282
by some sort of creative settlement.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.786
You want me in County a couple of months
for show, I can dig that.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.622
-But you gotta guarantee me no hard time.
-(scoffs)

37:30.122 --> 37:32.583
I've turned over on so many guys,
you send me upstate...

37:33.501 --> 37:34.335
I'm dog meat.

37:34.418 --> 37:37.088
What kind of arrangement
are we talking about, Mr. Wachtel?

37:37.171 --> 37:38.673
Hey, come on. Look.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.342
We got a first-rate bust
on a third-rate sleaze, Captain.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.803
Possession,
Possession With Intent, Rob One.

37:43.886 --> 37:44.971
Let's not throw this away.

37:45.054 --> 37:48.849
Gentlemen, can we negotiate this
somewhere in private?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.901
That's a shame about Pam Gilliam.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.529
Hell of a bright girl. What a bod.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.989
Legs all the way up to her--

38:03.072 --> 38:04.949
-Ray, in my o--
-Five minutes, Frank.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.660
Lark and Sanchez
brought in a rape suspect.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.370
We had no place else to put him.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.372
How about the old toilet, huh?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.416
Kill two birds with one stone,
so to speak.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.752
Yeah, hell of a woman, Joycie.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.713
Shoulda seen her first year of law school.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.673
I mean, what a number.

38:20.756 --> 38:22.425
BELKER: Don't squeeze it so hard.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.634
COFFEY: It won't fit if I don't.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.679
-BELKER: Just be gentle.
-COFFEY: It's as stiff as a board.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.681
A new department, huh, Frank?

38:30.599 --> 38:32.018
What's going on in there, Mick?

38:32.810 --> 38:34.520
Having a little funeral, Captain.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.106
I killed his mouse by accident.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.899
-(laughing)
-(Belker growling)

38:38.983 --> 38:41.235
Could you make it snappy?
We need a little privacy.

38:41.861 --> 38:42.820
Sure, Captain.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.327
(splash)

38:52.163 --> 38:53.289
Goodbye, little fella.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.294
(toilet flushes)

39:04.258 --> 39:05.426
Excuse me, Captain.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.395
The nuts are taking over the asylum.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.106
Now, you check my arithmetic, Wendell,

39:19.190 --> 39:24.028
but it's a classic case
of little fish, big fish.

39:24.820 --> 39:29.909
Now, I got a middle-level coke dealer
I could probably spring on entrapment,

39:29.992 --> 39:33.120
but he doesn't want to take the chance.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.248
Now, that gives your side and our side

39:36.332 --> 39:39.377
a mutuality of interest
in the, uh, bigger fish.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.920
What's your guy willing to take?

39:41.545 --> 39:45.049
"B" misdemeanor, maybe an "A,"
couple of years of probation.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.968
And before you guys give me
any phony groans,

39:48.803 --> 39:54.058
my client is ready to hand over
possibly the largest PCP lab in the state.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.103
-Interested?
-Frank?

39:59.563 --> 40:00.940
If it pans out.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.442
Let's keep talking, Alan.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.658
Damn bladder infection's killing me.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.412
Leastwise, I hope it's bladder,
because if it's prostate again,

40:14.495 --> 40:16.622
I... Eh.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.001
Anyway, I'll pass the word onto my client
that there's a deal in the works, huh?

40:21.710 --> 40:24.630
Wendell, Frank, pleasure as always.

40:29.635 --> 40:30.970
Oh, Wendell, whi--

40:35.724 --> 40:38.853
while I have you here, I could use
your input on another negotiation.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.938
What is this, "Let's Make A Deal"?

40:41.480 --> 40:43.816
We may have a line on the kid
who shot Pam Gilliam.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.781
I was there! I was there.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.702
But I didn't know about no gun he had,
or nothing like that.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.744
Who's "he"?

40:56.454 --> 40:59.123
-What's the name?
-Uh,<i> uno momento </i>there, Captain.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.000
Before we say another word,
I've gotta know

41:01.083 --> 41:03.335
my client's not gonna be charged
with First-Degree.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.132
I just spoke to Assistant D.A. Bernstein,
whose case this is.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.552
In return for the name of the shooter,
and assuming

41:11.635 --> 41:14.221
the surviving witness's
testimony corroborates,

41:15.055 --> 41:18.309
the district attorney will be disposed
towards a plea of Second-Degree,

41:18.392 --> 41:20.978
or maybe even voluntary manslaughter,
for Mr. Bragg.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.107
That offer is alive for exactly one hour.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.944
All right, now listen,
you just tell them what they want to hear.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.164
Wilbur. Wilbur Harmon.

41:40.623 --> 41:44.001
310 Jefferson Street, apartment 3-B.

41:44.084 --> 41:46.378
-Get a warrant, Ray. Let's bring him in.
-All right.

41:47.254 --> 41:49.298
Just once, I'd like to see
one of these things come down clean.

41:49.381 --> 41:51.884
-If he kicks this one up--
-I don't think he'll let it happen, baby.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.845
Gentlemen, so you'll know,

41:55.554 --> 41:59.225
we traded your coke dealer for a PCP lab.
You want it?

41:59.850 --> 42:01.894
Yes, sir. Sounds good to me, Captain.

42:01.977 --> 42:04.897
11:00 tomorrow morning,
Jerry Fuchs' office over at Division.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.565
It's a joint operation. He'll set it up.

42:06.649 --> 42:07.483
We'll be there.

42:13.948 --> 42:14.782
All right.

42:16.116 --> 42:16.992
Ready?

42:17.076 --> 42:17.910
Kick it in!

42:19.036 --> 42:20.412
All right, hold it right there!

42:56.657 --> 42:58.325
Don't let this one get away, Frank.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.413
I want his head on a stake
in the middle of Decker Avenue.

43:06.667 --> 43:07.751
(pinball machine dings)

43:15.634 --> 43:16.885
-Hey, LaRue.
-Hey, Bobby.

43:17.761 --> 43:18.596
Cowboy.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.349
What, are you a sadomasochist,
going to the sports arena in your uniform?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.642
Oh, man, I can't go.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.311
I got a recruitment meeting tonight.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.271
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.066
I got tickets here, scalped, $30 a ducat.
Look here, tickets!

43:31.400 --> 43:33.277
Hey, I'm really sorry, cowboy.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.614
Look, if you can't sell mine outside,
I'll give you the bread for it.

43:36.697 --> 43:37.948
No, no, I think I'd rather just go

43:38.032 --> 43:40.117
and sit there all alone,
watching the game.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.368
I said I was sorry.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.414
I guess I just don't understand

43:45.497 --> 43:47.499
this sudden political activism,
that's all.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.460
I didn't go looking for it, you know that.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.003
But it's on my hands now.

43:51.253 --> 43:53.172
I'm sorry if you feel left out.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.799
But the BOC's important,
not only for me,

43:55.883 --> 43:57.468
but for every Black
in the entire department.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.802
Please, stop.

43:59.053 --> 44:02.014
Those people have sold you
a can of pork and beans, buddy.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.807
Nobody sold me anything.

44:05.934 --> 44:10.064
All right. If this is about my precocity

44:10.147 --> 44:12.232
for telling ethnic-type jokes
all the time, then I--

44:12.316 --> 44:14.985
It's not about your lousy jokes, Renko.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.945
I'm used to your lousy jokes.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.323
Actually, come to think of it, yeah.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.909
I'm sick and tired of your lousy jokes.

44:21.992 --> 44:25.204
Heard you and Neal Washington
tell a lot worse jokes than I tell you.

44:25.287 --> 44:27.498
But that's between ourselves.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.085
So what are you saying here?

44:31.752 --> 44:34.421
You saying you're closer to him
than you are to me?

44:35.631 --> 44:36.715
That what you're saying?

44:39.093 --> 44:40.761
-Is that it?
-I don't know what I'm saying,

44:40.844 --> 44:42.971
but I gotta get through it, Renko.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.474
And a little understanding on your part

44:45.557 --> 44:47.559
would certainly go
a hell of a long way right now.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.437
Understand what? Get through what?

44:50.521 --> 44:52.731
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about!

44:57.027 --> 44:59.613
I'm doing what I have to do, Renko.

45:00.864 --> 45:04.827
If you can't support that,
and if you can't live with it,

45:04.910 --> 45:06.578
-then I don't know--
-Go!

45:08.706 --> 45:09.540
Just go.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.048
Lovers' quarrel?

45:20.968 --> 45:24.179
No, more like irreconcilable differences.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.223
Hmm. It happens, my man.

45:26.765 --> 45:29.017
I'll tell you, Andy,
life's kinda like a yo-yo.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.354
The big guy upstairs
is the Duncan Royal man.

45:33.021 --> 45:34.606
You're up, you're down.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.484
Myself, right now,
things couldn't be better.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.069
I'm on a hell of a case.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.322
PCP lab, biggest one in the state.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.074
What are you drinking?

45:45.951 --> 45:46.869
To tell you the truth, J.D.,

45:46.952 --> 45:49.079
I don't much feel like
socializing right now.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.957
It is not healthy to drink alone.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.500
Take it from an expert.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.043
Come on, what are you having?

45:58.547 --> 45:59.506
Shot and a beer.

45:59.923 --> 46:03.761
Yo, ace, a shot and a beer, twice.

46:05.971 --> 46:07.765
J.D., are you, uh...

46:08.640 --> 46:09.892
You off the wagon now?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.061
Yeah, you know what the problem was?

46:13.145 --> 46:15.939
Lousy self-image. I couldn't face myself.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.734
Booze wasn't the problem.
I was the problem.

46:18.817 --> 46:20.319
I don't have to duck out anymore.

46:20.402 --> 46:23.155
Things are different now.
Hey, I like myself, huh?

46:23.238 --> 46:24.823
I'm not gonna hurt myself. No way.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.367
I can handle it now.

46:29.912 --> 46:30.746
Cheers, huh?

46:38.587 --> 46:39.505
Ah!

46:40.255 --> 46:41.089
Cheers.

46:45.177 --> 46:48.388
You know, I've sprung kids
like Wilbur Harmon dozens of times.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.811
On technicalities,
on making cops look like liars.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.399
This one was on the streets

46:59.483 --> 47:02.277
because Rob Pragersing
got an Armed Robbery Second

47:02.361 --> 47:04.279
kicked down to a misdemeanor assault.

47:10.285 --> 47:12.412
When he found out
it was Harmon who killed Pam,

47:14.998 --> 47:18.377
he went out, got drunk,
then came back to the office and resigned.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.050
Can't say I blame him, either.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.395
I'm thinking of quitting myself.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.607
That won't make the problem go away.

47:40.983 --> 47:42.818
At least I won't have to be a part of it.

47:44.611 --> 47:47.155
I just don't know if I can walk
into an interrogation room again

47:47.239 --> 47:48.699
and look into one of those kids' faces

47:48.782 --> 47:51.076
without wondering
who he's going to kill next time.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.041
We teach them the law is a game.

47:58.458 --> 47:59.543
It's easy to play.

47:59.626 --> 48:02.880
Then we go home, watch the news,

48:02.963 --> 48:04.715
lock our doors and windows,

48:05.299 --> 48:06.592
and lie awake frightened to death,

48:06.675 --> 48:09.094
wondering what's happening
to the quality of our lives.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.766
It just isn't fair.

48:15.726 --> 48:16.935
She was so young...

48:19.104 --> 48:20.230
so special.

48:26.737 --> 48:29.197
Oh, God,
I'm going to miss her so terribly.

48:46.673 --> 48:49.676
(closing theme playing)
