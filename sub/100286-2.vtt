01:46.022 --> 01:48.108
So, I'm a grandmother. I'm a grandmother.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.735
I know you're looking at me like,
"Are you a fucking grandmother?"

01:50.819 --> 01:51.736
Yes!

[laughing]

02:13.466 --> 02:15.093
[Ms. Pat laughs]

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
Bitch, I've been a mama
since I was 14 years old.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.392
I'm not excited about your ugly-ass kids.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561

02:25.687 --> 02:26.521
He gonna tell me,

02:26.604 --> 02:29.732
"What type of grandmother you are?
Never want to keep your grandkids."

02:29.816 --> 02:30.859
I say, "Nigga...

02:32.861 --> 02:35.113
I'm the type of grandmother
that still fuck."

02:35.822 --> 02:38.074

[Ms. Pat chuckles]

02:53.381 --> 02:54.841
Not for real, white people.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.218
That's how you get out
of fucking keeping kids.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.928
[uproarious laughter]

03:02.140 --> 03:05.810
They talk too fucking much.
My granddaughter talks too fucking much.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.854
My daughter-in-law called me one day,
she was like,

03:07.937 --> 03:09.939
"Ms. Pat, could you
pick up Ashley from school?"

03:10.023 --> 03:11.441
I'm like, "Fuck, okay."

03:11.649 --> 03:13.651
[audience laughs]

03:13.818 --> 03:15.987
I get up to the school, y'all,
and I get her,

03:16.070 --> 03:18.907
and I don't like it because she likes
to start a fucking conversation.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.451
I don't want to talk to no damn kid, okay?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.537
I'm a 47-year-old black woman
with hot flashes.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.498
Bitch, talk to me when your titties
heat up to 99 degrees.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.584
[audience laughs]

03:30.585 --> 03:33.630
So, I pick her up and I put her in
the car like, "Put your seat belt on."

03:33.713 --> 03:36.758
And out of nowhere, y'all,
she started a fucking conversation.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.053
She was like, "Grandmama?"
I'm like, "What, baby?"

03:40.136 --> 03:44.891
She say, "My mama said
you get on her motherfucking nerves."

03:45.016 --> 03:47.018
[audience oohs and laughs]

03:50.355 --> 03:53.900
And I said, "Fuck your mama.
She get on my motherfucking nerves.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.027
[cheering and laughter]

03:56.736 --> 03:58.404
That's why your little brothers are ugly,

03:58.488 --> 04:01.074
you ain't got no edges, and my son
ain't gonna marry your mama."

04:01.157 --> 04:03.201
[audience whoos]

04:05.078 --> 04:07.080
[applause]

04:08.331 --> 04:10.291
Don't "ooh" me, she started that shit.

04:12.126 --> 04:15.088
You think I'm supposed to let her win
because she's five years old?

04:15.171 --> 04:16.047
Fuck that baby.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.715
[laughing]

04:21.761 --> 04:22.804
She talks too much!

04:22.887 --> 04:25.598
She talks too fucking much
and that's what I keep telling my son.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.226
I'm like, "You need to bust your daughter
in the jaw."

04:28.309 --> 04:30.311
[laughter]

04:30.395 --> 04:31.771
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

04:32.063 --> 04:34.482
My granddaughter tells
all my son's business.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.401
My granddaughter goes to school
from my house,

04:36.484 --> 04:38.111
'cause I live in a nice neighborhood.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.363
White people,
you call that fucking cheating.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.949
But black people call that
higher education.

04:43.074 --> 04:43.992
[woman whoos]

04:44.117 --> 04:45.618
So she goes to school from my house,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.620
she goes to school
and tells her fucking teacher,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.873
"My mommy and daddy fell on hard times,
so we moved out of our house

04:50.957 --> 04:54.002
into an apartment
until we can get back on our feet."

04:54.085 --> 04:55.670
Like she pays fucking bills.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.130
[audience laughs]

04:57.213 --> 04:58.631
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

05:00.925 --> 05:02.385
The teacher called me and was like,

05:02.468 --> 05:05.096
"Ms. Pat, Ashley said you guys moved out
of the neighborhood."

05:05.179 --> 05:07.890
I was like, "What? Don't listen to her,
she smokes weed."

05:08.099 --> 05:10.184
[cackling]

05:11.894 --> 05:13.187
Stupid-ass child.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
That's why I don't fuck with my family
to this day.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
I do not fuck with my family, y'all.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.863
'Cause five years ago, I went home
to Atlanta to celebrate with my family

05:21.946 --> 05:26.200
because it was the first time we was all
out of jail at the same fucking time.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.369
[laughter and cheering]

05:28.870 --> 05:31.164
[laughs] I pull up in Atlanta,
my niece called me.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.875
She was like, "Auntie, I need a favor."
I'm like, "What do you want?"

05:33.958 --> 05:36.419
She said, "My sister is homeless
and she got four kids.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.756
One of the babies is two weeks old.
Can they please come live with you?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.258
I know you just built that big-ass house
in Indiana."

05:42.342 --> 05:44.510
And I said, "Fuck no, bitch!

05:44.594 --> 05:45.803
[audience laughs]

05:46.054 --> 05:49.474
Them crack babies ain't coming to my house
and write on my new walls."

05:49.724 --> 05:51.726
[laughter]

05:52.226 --> 05:55.021
My son was on the call, he was like,
"Mama, you should help her out."

05:55.104 --> 05:58.274
I'm like, "Why?" He said, "When you was
down and out, somebody helped you out.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
Do you remember the time Daddy
shot you in the head,

06:00.443 --> 06:02.862
dragged you behind that truck
and gave you them STDs?"

06:02.945 --> 06:04.947
I'm like, "Damn, nigga.
You remember all that shit?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.282
[laughing]

06:06.824 --> 06:09.035
Let's go get the crack babies
and their mama."

06:10.536 --> 06:12.288
I go over and I pick up my niece

06:12.372 --> 06:14.415
and I take her back to my husband
with the four kids.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.710
I'm like, "Look, the crack babies
and their mama coming to live with us."

06:18.252 --> 06:20.630
On the way home from Atlanta to Indiana,
y'all,

06:20.713 --> 06:22.757
my chest started hurting really bad.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.301
So I tell my husband,
"Pull the fuck over, my chest hurts.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.427
I'm having a heart attack."

06:26.511 --> 06:29.263
He was like, "Calm down,
your ass ain't having no heart attack."

06:29.347 --> 06:32.183
He said,
"What you're having is an anxiety attack."

06:32.266 --> 06:34.602
I'm like, "What the fuck
make you think I'm having that?"

06:34.685 --> 06:36.270
He was like, "Look in the backseat.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.606
[audience laughs]

06:39.732 --> 06:44.237
[laughs] You just picked up five niggas,
and you don't know how you'll feed them."

06:44.529 --> 06:46.531
[continued laughter]

06:48.699 --> 06:52.245
I get my niece back to Indiana, y'all,
I help her get off drugs,

06:52.328 --> 06:55.706
I co-sign for a car, a job, apartment,
every fucking thing.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.585
Two years in, this bitch run off
and leave me with these four crack babies.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.712
-[audience oohs]
-Don't "aw," just a crackhead story,

07:01.796 --> 07:03.714
-it's a good ending.
-[laughter]

07:04.132 --> 07:06.217
[laughs] Now, I'm raising a five,
a seven--

07:06.300 --> 07:09.512
I don't know how old these motherfuckers
is, they just still at my fucking house.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.930
And let me just say this to y'all,

07:11.013 --> 07:13.599
this is not my first set of crack babies
I've raised.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.852
[laughter]

07:17.854 --> 07:19.772
This is my third fucking set.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.443
I raised my sister's kids,
my sister-in-law's kids,

07:23.526 --> 07:24.819
now I got my niece's kids.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.029
I had to go talk with God.
I said, "Look, God,

07:27.113 --> 07:29.031
I'm done being your crack baby keeper.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.658
[audience laughs]

07:31.117 --> 07:33.995
You got to find somebody else for this
shit, I'm too old."

07:34.245 --> 07:36.622
'Cause I don't know if y'all know anything
about crack babies,

07:36.706 --> 07:40.710
but these new crack babies ain't nothing
like these fucking '90s crack babies.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.880
These new motherfuckers
come with technology.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.384
I got a five-year-old running around
my house, "Where my iPad at?"

07:48.468 --> 07:51.721
I'm like, "How the fuck you can work
an iPad but you shit on yourself?"

07:51.929 --> 07:54.265
[laughing]

07:55.766 --> 07:57.894
Can you Google how to shit in a toilet?

07:58.060 --> 08:00.062
[continued laughter]

08:00.521 --> 08:03.191
Can Elsa show you how to "Let It Go"
the right way?

08:06.235 --> 08:08.613
And I took these kids
out of the inner city of Atlanta,

08:08.696 --> 08:11.199
and I put them in a neighborhood
that looks just like this room

08:11.282 --> 08:13.534
if you get rid
of these three black people.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.661
[audience laughs]

08:15.995 --> 08:18.748
Oh, two. I'm sorry.
I called you a nigga. I'm sorry.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.917
[uproarious laughter]

08:24.045 --> 08:26.047
[Ms. Pat laughs]

08:27.590 --> 08:30.051
And one thing I realized
by raising these crack babies

08:30.134 --> 08:31.844
in this all white neighborhood, y'all,

08:31.928 --> 08:34.805
white schools will call you
for any-fucking-thing.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.141
Black schools, they don't do that shit.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.520
We tell them, "Bitch, that's your child
till 2:30, don't you wake me up."

08:40.645 --> 08:42.647
[laughter]

08:43.856 --> 08:45.733
And they call you for dumb shit, too.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.903
My very first phone call
was for my niece Yolanda.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.531
The teacher called, like, "Ms. Pat,
can you come up to the school?"

08:51.614 --> 08:53.199
I'm like, "For what?"
"It's an emergency."

08:53.282 --> 08:56.452
I'm like, "Damn. I got to take a bath,
put on a wig and put on a bra?"

08:56.702 --> 08:57.787
[audience laughs]

08:58.663 --> 09:00.039
I get up to the school, y'all,

09:00.122 --> 09:03.251
come to find out my niece Yolanda's
sitting at the crayon table

09:03.334 --> 09:04.919
with all her little white friends

09:05.002 --> 09:07.046
and they're talking about their daddies.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.258
And she say,
"Well, the next time I see my daddy,

09:10.341 --> 09:12.134
I'm going to stab him in the neck."

09:12.385 --> 09:14.387
[audience laughs and oohs]

09:17.390 --> 09:18.975
And all the white kids started crying,

09:19.058 --> 09:21.519
"Yolanda gonna stab
her daddy in the neck!"

09:22.728 --> 09:25.856
I'm like, "Ma'am, you call me up
to this school for this bullshit?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.651
She can't stab her daddy in the neck.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.529
That nigga in jail, somebody else
going to stab him in the neck."

09:31.696 --> 09:33.698
[laughing and applause]

09:34.824 --> 09:36.742
Just relax, just relax. It's funny, okay?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.244
-Just relax.
-[uproarious laughter]

09:40.621 --> 09:42.832
White people be staring at you
like you reading the Bible,

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
like, "What the fuck
are you talking about?"

09:45.626 --> 09:46.627
Buckle up, white bitch.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.713
I'm about to take you
on a negro field trip.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.840
[audience oohs and laughs]

09:52.508 --> 09:53.968
[woman whoos]

09:54.135 --> 09:56.762
[chuckles] I have a niece named Portia.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.097
She's weird as fuck, right?

09:58.556 --> 09:59.515
She weird as fuck.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.310
She's in the third grade,
but she reads on the tenth grade level.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.021
I told my husband, like,
"This baby's as smart as fuck.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.023
Her mama did the good dope
with her."

10:07.273 --> 10:09.275
[audience laughs]

10:10.985 --> 10:13.779
[laughs] But she do crazy shit,
like she loves

10:13.863 --> 10:15.156
pulling her own tooth, y'all.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.741
I don't even know if they be ready.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.452
She just snatch them out of her mouth
and bring them to you.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.412
"Look, Auntie, I pulled my tooth."

10:21.495 --> 10:24.373
I said, "You pull one more
motherfucking tooth, crack baby,

10:24.457 --> 10:26.500
I'm gonna uppercut the shit out your ass."

10:26.626 --> 10:28.502
[laughter]

10:28.628 --> 10:31.047
Her whole front grill is gone
for eight dollars.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.507
[continued laughter]

10:38.137 --> 10:41.307
So it's three girls and a boy.
I have a nephew named Ramon, right?

10:41.390 --> 10:44.769
So I'm giving him a bath one day
and I'm washing the back of him,

10:44.852 --> 10:47.855
I was like, "Turn around, Ramon,
so I can wash the front of you."

10:47.938 --> 10:51.484
You know, this kid turned around.
He had the biggest dick I ever seen.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.526
[audience laughs]

10:52.652 --> 10:55.946
And it had a hook in it, too.
I was like, "Whoa, nigga!"

10:56.572 --> 10:59.200
[chuckles] "Put your dick down!"

10:59.450 --> 11:00.743
[laughing]

11:01.243 --> 11:03.621
He was like, "What's a dick, Auntie?"

11:04.038 --> 11:06.040
[cackling]

11:09.919 --> 11:13.005
[laughs] I dropped that fucking soap
and I ran up out of there.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.095
I told my husband, "We can't raise
this boy in this all white neighborhood."

11:19.303 --> 11:21.305
[laughter and oohs]

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
He was like, "Why?"

11:27.019 --> 11:29.146
I was like,
"He's gonna slay these bitches!"

11:29.355 --> 11:31.273
[audience laughs]

11:31.440 --> 11:33.859
They're going to be on our roof
like kitty cats.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.028
[continued laughter]

11:36.987 --> 11:38.406
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

11:39.532 --> 11:41.117
That baby got a big old dick.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.743
White girls, y'all seen that shit

11:42.827 --> 11:45.871
when Nicki Minaj's boyfriend fucking
broke the internet with that dick?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.498
-It's that type of dick.
-[woman cheers]

11:47.623 --> 11:51.502
You know, you can't suck it like this,
you gotta suck it in the headlock.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.587
[audience laughs]

11:54.130 --> 11:57.842
Ain't no white man laughing at me, like,
"What the fuck are they talking about?"

11:58.050 --> 12:00.052
[laughter]

12:00.678 --> 12:03.180
White girl, explain that joke
to your white husband.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.349
[audience oohs]

12:06.892 --> 12:08.185
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

12:11.689 --> 12:14.525
I tell you, see, like when I first
got custody of this kid,

12:14.608 --> 12:15.609
he was thug as fuck.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.070
Now, all he do is cry
like a little white kid.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.989
I'm home a couple weeks ago,
he's crying,

12:20.072 --> 12:22.742
"Auntie, they're picking on me.
They're picking on me."

12:22.825 --> 12:24.827
I'm like, "Ramon,
stop that motherfucking crying!

12:24.910 --> 12:26.370
Big dick niggas don't cry."

12:26.537 --> 12:28.539
[audience laughs]

12:32.334 --> 12:34.044
Little dick niggas cry!

12:36.130 --> 12:37.339
[Ms. Pat laughs]

12:39.717 --> 12:43.387
I like people who appreciate that joke,
"Yeah, I know."

12:44.346 --> 12:45.514
[applause]

12:46.807 --> 12:49.268
Before school ended last year,
the principal called me.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.187
She was like,
"Ms. Pat, I need to talk to you."

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
I'm like, "What the fuck you want?
I'm not at home."

12:53.355 --> 12:54.190
[laughter]

12:54.273 --> 12:57.568
Call all the fucking time for nothing.
I'm like, "What do you want?"

12:57.651 --> 13:01.739
She was like, "Ramon said a bad word."
I'm like, "Okay, ma'am, what did he say?"

13:01.822 --> 13:04.700
She said,
"I could never say what Ramon said."

13:06.452 --> 13:07.912
So, as you can see I like to curse.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.039
My favorite word
is nigga and motherfucker.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.499
I say it all day everyday.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.792
[woman cackles]

13:13.083 --> 13:16.212
So I'm thinking to myself,
"Did Ramon go up to this white school

13:16.295 --> 13:18.798
and call one of these white kids
the N-word?"

13:18.881 --> 13:20.508
So, I was like, "Ma'am, what did he say?"

13:20.591 --> 13:24.094
She was like, "I could never say it."
I said, "Okay, put him on the phone."

13:24.470 --> 13:26.472
[audience laughs]

13:30.184 --> 13:31.227
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

13:31.519 --> 13:33.854
She put him on the phone,
he was like, "Hello, Auntie."

13:33.938 --> 13:37.441
I said, "Nigga, what the fuck you
done said at that motherfucking school?"

13:37.650 --> 13:38.609
[laughter]

13:38.818 --> 13:41.570
He was like,
"Auntie, all I said was 'Jesus Christ'."

13:41.654 --> 13:43.489
I said, "Put that bitch
back on the phone."

13:43.656 --> 13:45.658
[audience oohs and laughs]

13:45.825 --> 13:47.159
Like, "Ma'am, are you for real?"

13:47.243 --> 13:48.661
She was like, "Yes, Miss Pat.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.038
You can't say Jesus Christ
when you're frustrated

13:51.121 --> 13:52.540
unless you're on your knees."

13:52.623 --> 13:56.126
I'm like, "Bitch, if I'm on my knees,
I'm trying to get my car note paid."

13:56.210 --> 13:58.212
[audience oohs and cheers]

13:59.255 --> 14:01.924
Can y'all explain this joke
to these people over here, please?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.260
[cheering and applause]

14:05.219 --> 14:08.681
[woman whoos]

14:10.891 --> 14:12.393
But if you see these crack babies now,

14:12.476 --> 14:16.146
you'd never believe I pulled these kids
out of a crack house five years ago.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.566
They are bougie as fuck.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.775
[audience laughs]

14:19.984 --> 14:21.485
I had them in the car with me one day,

14:21.569 --> 14:23.195
I was like,
"Y'all want something to eat?"

14:23.279 --> 14:25.072
My niece Yolanda was like, "Yes, ma'am."

14:25.155 --> 14:28.284
I said, "You want some McDonald's?"
She was like, "McDonald's?

14:28.492 --> 14:29.577
[laughter]

14:29.827 --> 14:32.204
We don't eat McDonald's.
We eat Chick-fil-A."

14:32.663 --> 14:34.039
[audience laughs]

14:34.248 --> 14:36.041
And I'm thinking to myself,
"Really, bitch?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.210
Because I remember
when you didn't eat at all."

14:38.294 --> 14:42.089
-[Ms. Pat cackles]
-[audience laughs]

14:45.801 --> 14:47.761
These kids don't know how good
they got it, y'all,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.805
'cause I grew up in the inner city
of Atlanta

14:49.889 --> 14:52.850
in a bootleg house
with my grandfather, y'all.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.059
You hear me?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.394
Everything went in his house,

14:55.477 --> 14:57.938
from gambling, to prostitution,
to niggas getting shot,

14:58.022 --> 14:59.273
every-fucking-thing.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.610
I remember my mom used to love
to shoot craps, but she had one leg.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.612
So before she got on the floor
to shoot the craps,

15:04.695 --> 15:05.988
she would take her one leg off.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.823
And the reason
why she took her one leg off,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.366
in case she threw the dice too far,

15:09.450 --> 15:11.660
she could use her leg to pull
them bitches back.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.370
[audience oohs and laughs]

15:14.121 --> 15:16.874
[Ms. Pat laughs]

15:17.333 --> 15:19.710
But what I remember most
about this house is

15:19.793 --> 15:22.588
my granddaddy used to love
to watch wrestling.

15:22.671 --> 15:26.550
He had this thing about black wrestlers
beating the shit out of white wrestlers.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.719
Like, [laughs] Thunderbolt Patterson...

15:28.802 --> 15:30.930
He was screaming at the TV
when Thunderbolt Patterson

15:31.013 --> 15:32.473
was beating up somebody white.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.808
-[yelling] "Kill that cracker!"
-[laughter]

15:35.017 --> 15:38.228
And I'd be sitting next to him,
[yelling] "Kill that cracker!"

15:38.646 --> 15:42.024
And I had no fucking clue you
white people was supposed to be crackers.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.611
So when I got older,
'cause this shit was shot in Atlanta,

15:45.694 --> 15:48.572
when I got older I wanted to go see
a match on my own, y'all.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.450
So I'm at... I'm at Peachtree downtown.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.994
[Ms. Pat laughs]

15:54.703 --> 15:57.581
I go... I go to this... I'm on my way
to the wrestling match

15:57.665 --> 16:00.209
and I stopped at a Marriott Hotel
to call my brother.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.920
I'm like, "Hurry the fuck up,
we're going to miss the goddamn match."

16:03.003 --> 16:06.090
He was like, "I'm on my way."
So I hang up the phone and I look up

16:06.173 --> 16:08.300
and this white man is staring at me.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.887
He was like, "Hey, how you doing?"
I'm like, "Hey, how you doing?"

16:12.012 --> 16:12.930
[laughter]

16:13.097 --> 16:15.349
He was like, "You want to go back
to my room with me?"

16:15.432 --> 16:16.308
I'm like, "Okay."

16:16.725 --> 16:18.727
[audience laughs]

16:18.894 --> 16:21.730
I ain't never been
to a Marriott Hotel before. [laughs]

16:21.939 --> 16:23.357
[continued laughter]

16:23.524 --> 16:25.109
Especially not in their room.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.318
[woman whoos]

16:26.443 --> 16:27.695
He opened the door, y'all,

16:27.778 --> 16:30.280
and the first thing I noticed,
he had fucking air conditioning.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.324
We didn't have AC
when we were coming up.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.077
We had that one fan that my mama kept
in front of her pussy

16:35.160 --> 16:37.621
and it blew her pussy all
through the house all day.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.872
[audience oohs]

16:39.039 --> 16:41.792
Like, "Can somebody tell mama
her pussy stinks today?"

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
[audience laughs]

16:44.211 --> 16:45.504
[Ms. Pat chuckles]

16:45.754 --> 16:48.132
He go over to the little refrigerator
in the hotel room,

16:48.215 --> 16:51.260
he open the door, y'all,
and he give me a real Coca-Cola.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.263
At this time in my life,
I had never had a real Coca-Cola.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.307
Colas, and maybe Kool-Aid,
but not Coca-Cola.

16:57.391 --> 17:01.061
I was so fucking excited, I popped
that shit and I drunk it in one swallow.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.564
He walked me over to the bed,
he don't say shit,

17:03.647 --> 17:06.025
he just unzipped his pants
and take out his white dick.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.318
And I had never seen
a white dick before, y'all.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.280
And white dicks look
like an uncooked chicken leg to me.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.324
-[woman screams]
-[cackling]

17:16.869 --> 17:18.871
[laughter]

17:19.621 --> 17:21.040
[Ms. Pat laughs]

17:21.331 --> 17:24.084
Look at all the white dudes, like,
"What the fuck is she talking about?"

17:24.460 --> 17:26.462
[continued laughter]

17:26.837 --> 17:31.341
And he wrapped my hand around, he made
me go up and down and up and down,

17:31.425 --> 17:34.636
and I'm thinking to myself,
"Is this how white people barbecue?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.346
[audience oohs and laughs]

17:36.805 --> 17:39.767
'Cause this chicken leg needs
some fucking seasoning salt."

17:41.268 --> 17:44.688
About five minutes in, something
came out of the chicken leg, y'all,

17:44.772 --> 17:48.275
[laughs] so he took it out of my hand
and he wiped my hand off

17:48.358 --> 17:49.526
and he gave me $100.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.112
I'm like,
"Sir, are you going to be here tomorrow?"

17:52.196 --> 17:53.405
[audience laughs]

17:54.073 --> 17:56.075
[applause]

17:56.867 --> 17:59.787
[chuckles] I couldn't wait to get home
to tell my mama.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.041
I'm like, "Mama, a white man's
downtown giving you $100

18:04.124 --> 18:06.001
to hold onto uncooked chicken legs."

18:06.210 --> 18:07.628
-[woman whoos]
-[laughter]

18:07.836 --> 18:10.297
My mama was like, "Where they at, bitch?
Where they at?"

18:13.550 --> 18:16.470
That was a lot of fucking money
for an 11-year-old.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.596
[audience oohs]

18:21.058 --> 18:22.684
Oh, fuck you, white people!

18:22.893 --> 18:24.061
[laughter]

18:24.353 --> 18:27.564
That's more money than
your lemonade stands ever fucking made.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.983
[laughter]

18:30.359 --> 18:31.360
[Ms. Pat laughs]

18:31.527 --> 18:34.238
You ain't never made that kind of money
at your shitty-ass

18:34.321 --> 18:35.572
lemonade stand.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.494
Fuck y'all, that white man
was creating jobs in the black community.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.123
[laughs] Hey y'all. I'm Ms. Pat.
Thank y'all so very much.
