01:05.958 --> 01:07.875
Huh?

01:07.875 --> 01:09.333
Play with us, Hissy!

01:09.333 --> 01:12.166
Pretty please with kitty treats
on top?

01:12.166 --> 01:14.625
You always play with us
when we throw the yarn for you!

01:14.625 --> 01:16.208
(laughs)

01:16.208 --> 01:18.625
Oooh... ahhh!

01:18.625 --> 01:22.250
Sorry, but I'm right
in the middle of an important
nap right now.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.375
Are Bingo and Rolly
playing with Hissy?

01:25.375 --> 01:27.958
We're trying, but Hissy
doesn't wanna play.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.375
How about this?

01:29.375 --> 01:31.250
Lights activated!

01:31.250 --> 01:34.416
Ooh? Huh! Huh!
Ha-ha! Ha!

01:34.416 --> 01:37.458
(laughs)
Hissy's playing!

01:37.458 --> 01:41.458
(laughs)
Well, (yawns)
that was fun. Hm-hm.

01:41.458 --> 01:42.708
Are you done already?

01:42.708 --> 01:45.250
(sighs)
I'm not a baby kitten anymore.

01:45.250 --> 01:49.291
I still like to play and all,
I just don't play as much
as I used to.

01:49.291 --> 01:50.583
-Meow.
-(door opens)

01:50.583 --> 01:55.291
Hey, everybody.
I found this lost kitten
hiding in the bushes.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.416
Mew.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.291
Aww, hi there.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.750
(mewing)

01:58.750 --> 02:01.583
Aw, the tag must've
fallen off her collar,

02:01.583 --> 02:03.875
so, I don't know
where she lives.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.583
(sniffing)

02:05.583 --> 02:10.125
So the kitten is gonna stay
right here until we can find
where she lives.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.250
Wait-- What now?

02:11.250 --> 02:14.125
Well, I'd be so sad
if one of you ever got lost,

02:14.125 --> 02:17.708
so, I'm sure this kitten's
owner's really worried, too.

02:17.708 --> 02:21.000
I'll make some calls at work
today and try to find her home.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.500
And you can play
with my kitty while I'm gone.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.875
-(door opens and closes)
-Is he talking about me?

02:26.875 --> 02:30.416
Hi, kitten, I'm Bingo.
And this is my brother, Rolly.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.291
And this is Hissy and ARF.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.833
ARF loves the new kitten!

02:33.833 --> 02:35.416
Uhhhh....

02:35.416 --> 02:36.458
What's your name?

02:36.458 --> 02:37.458
(mew)

02:37.458 --> 02:39.458
She's probably too young
to know how to talk.

02:39.458 --> 02:41.333
Ooh! We can give her a name!

02:41.333 --> 02:43.750
How about Whiskers
McTwitchytail?

02:43.750 --> 02:45.416
Or Dino Rocketblaster!

02:45.416 --> 02:47.166
(disapproving noises) Mew.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.583
Huh. Why don't you just
name her Snowflake

02:49.583 --> 02:52.250
'cause of that white splotch
on her forehead?

02:52.250 --> 02:54.458
(meow and purring)

02:54.458 --> 02:57.375
-That's perfect!
She loves it!
-And she loves you!

02:57.375 --> 03:02.458
Ohh-kay, Snowflake.
I'm not really a snuggler, so...

03:02.458 --> 03:05.208
ARF is a snuggler,
and a cuddler.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.458
Bob said he doesn't know
where Snowflake's home is.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.000
And that her owner
must be sad that she's lost.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.583
And she's too young
to tell us where she lives.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.166
So it's our mission
to help Bob find
Snowflake's home.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.250
Bingo:
Can you kitty-sit
until we get back?

03:19.250 --> 03:20.875
She's too little
to come with us.

03:20.875 --> 03:25.166
-(purring)
-But baby kittens like to run,
and jump, and play,

03:25.166 --> 03:28.500
and... I want to do
none of those things, ha-ha.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.416
We'll be back
as fast as we can.

03:30.416 --> 03:32.458
Okay, fine.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.250
Just hurry, please.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.500
-Bye, Snowflake!
-Thanks, Hissy.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.875
-This is gonna be a long day.

for how we're gonna find
Snowflake's home?

04:36.166 --> 04:38.833
Sure do.
Hissy says she played
a lot as a kitten.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.500
So we need to think of things
kittens like to play with,

04:41.500 --> 04:43.583
and then go to the places
that have those things.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.250
Pup-tastic plan!

04:45.250 --> 04:47.583
One of those places
has to be Snowflake's home.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.458
And I think I know
where to look first.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.625
Rolly:
Kittens love playing with yarn.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.000
Maybe Snowflake lives here.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.416
Let's see if we find
any cat stuff around.

04:56.416 --> 04:59.166
Then we'll know for sure
if this is the right place.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.750
I'll check in here. (grunts)

05:01.750 --> 05:04.875
No cat beds.
Lots of yarn, though!

05:04.875 --> 05:06.000
Oops, I'll get those!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.416
(grunts, giggles)

05:09.458 --> 05:11.458
Yarn storm!

05:11.458 --> 05:14.458
We're on a mission
to find Snowflake's home, Rolly.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.500
We don't have time
to play with all the balls
of yarn in the store.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.625
We won't play
with all of 'em,

05:19.625 --> 05:21.583
just the ones
that are already on the floor.

05:21.583 --> 05:25.458
Oh. I guess we have time
for that.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.625
Fine, I'll get you out.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.125
Just, hold still.

06:30.125 --> 06:34.166
Who gets this tangled up
in yarn?

06:35.416 --> 06:38.000
We tried looking for some thing
a kitten would play with,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.125
but this place clearly
isn't her home.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.291
Let's look for some one
she'd play with,

06:42.291 --> 06:44.291
maybe her home
would be with them!

06:44.291 --> 06:47.166
That sounds better,
and way less tangle-y.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.708
(startled meow)

06:55.708 --> 06:57.333
Huh... okay.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.583
Ha-ha!
Snowflake made Hissy
jump high!

07:00.583 --> 07:02.875
Ha-ha,
don't scare me like that.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.750
I mean, not that
I'm scared of a tiny kitten,

07:05.750 --> 07:08.708
it was just
my cat-like reflexes.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.750
And stop with the tail.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.583
Why don't you go play
with ARF or something?

07:13.583 --> 07:16.375
Yes! Oh yes!
ARF loves to play!

07:16.375 --> 07:17.500
(mew)

07:17.500 --> 07:20.125
Oh, my! You are playful.

07:20.125 --> 07:24.583
(yawn) Well, it looks like
you have kitty-sitting
under control, ARF.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.500
And if I fall asleep now,
I can still get--

07:27.500 --> 07:28.583
ARF: Lights activated.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.833
Lights!

07:29.833 --> 07:31.000
Meow, meow?

07:33.708 --> 07:36.875
Must. Catch. Lights.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.750
Ha-ha! Got it!

07:38.750 --> 07:41.416
Wait. Snowflake.
Don't pounce on it.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.000
(breaking)

07:43.000 --> 07:45.208
Turn the light off, ARF!

07:45.208 --> 07:47.458
ARF wants to,
but ARF's button is stuck!

07:47.458 --> 07:50.708
-(mewing)
-(tearing)

07:50.708 --> 07:52.583
Ooh, do something, ARF!

07:52.583 --> 07:54.625
ARF can't turn them offfff!

07:54.625 --> 07:55.625
Hissy can.

07:55.625 --> 07:56.875
(bang, thud)

07:56.875 --> 07:58.458
(tapping on ARF)

07:58.458 --> 07:59.708
(panting)

07:59.708 --> 08:01.833
(mewing)

08:01.833 --> 08:04.750
All right.
Before you cause
any more trouble,

08:04.750 --> 08:06.250
we're going outside.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.583
And ARF will clean up inside.

08:09.583 --> 08:13.125
(sigh) There wasn't anyone
for a kitten to play with
in the park.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.875
So we haven't gotten any closer
to finding her home.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.750
Maybe we should find
the lost cat on that poster,

08:18.750 --> 08:21.250
and ask if she knows
where Snowflake lives.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.291
(scratching)

08:22.291 --> 08:24.875
Rolly, the cat on that poster
is Snowflake!

08:24.875 --> 08:27.208
Rolly:
Oh, you're right!

08:27.208 --> 08:29.750
That lady who put the poster
must be her owner.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.583
She's looking
for a lost kitty!

08:31.583 --> 08:33.875
She did seem sad,
just like Bob said.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.583
When Bob reads that poster,
he'll know where
Snowflake lives.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.833
So he can take her home!

08:37.833 --> 08:41.291
Then we'd better catch
that getaway poster!

08:41.291 --> 08:43.125

08:44.333 --> 08:45.500
(squeaking)

08:47.166 --> 08:48.625

08:48.625 --> 08:50.708

08:50.708 --> 08:52.458

08:52.458 --> 08:54.208

08:54.208 --> 08:56.125
(mewing)

08:57.708 --> 09:02.333
(yawn)
Time for a nap.
Keep it down, would ya?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.875
(mewing and chirping)

09:05.875 --> 09:07.500
Wow. Really?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.583
(distressed squeaking)

09:11.000 --> 09:12.125
Wait!

09:12.125 --> 09:13.583
Don't go up there, Snowflake!

09:13.583 --> 09:15.833
It's too high for a kitty!

09:15.833 --> 09:18.458
(mewing)

09:19.708 --> 09:21.833
(distressed mewing)

09:21.833 --> 09:23.708
Hang in there, Snowflake!
I'll save you!

09:23.708 --> 09:25.708
(mewing)

09:32.291 --> 09:33.833
You're okay, kiddo.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.250
Hissy's here.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.625
(mewing and purring)

09:40.958 --> 09:43.708
It's not like
I mind being high up,

09:43.708 --> 09:46.583
but this is really high up.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.958
Also, I'm not sure
how to get us both down.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.083
(mew)

09:51.083 --> 09:54.750
Oh, don't worry.
ARF can help. ARF!

09:54.750 --> 09:55.833
ARF!

09:55.833 --> 09:59.708
(music playing from inside)

09:59.708 --> 10:03.583
Ugh. ARF can't hear me
over his cleaning music.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.875
I can't wait to tell Hissy
that we found Snowflake's home.

10:06.875 --> 10:07.875
Hissy:
You did what, now?

10:09.083 --> 10:11.833
Oh, hi, Hissy.
How's kitty-sitting?

10:11.833 --> 10:14.875
Well, we're both trapped
in a tree.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.166
So, things could be better.

10:17.166 --> 10:20.583
We can help you!
I'm good at jumping.

10:20.583 --> 10:24.291
(grunting)

10:24.291 --> 10:25.833
Rolly: Go, Bingo!

10:25.833 --> 10:28.583
-(grunts)
-Impressive.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.875
But now we're all
trapped in the tree.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.000
Not if we use
my puppy parachute!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.875
Absolutely not!

10:34.875 --> 10:37.958
Don't worry, Hissy!
I'll be right here
the whole time!

10:37.958 --> 10:41.416
Doesn't really make me feel,
hmm, better!

10:44.125 --> 10:47.458
Hissy, could you maybe
loosen up on the claws a little?

10:47.458 --> 10:49.958
-Oh no. Pool. Pool!
-(mews)

10:49.958 --> 10:51.500
(splash)

10:53.166 --> 10:54.458
(spitting water)

10:54.458 --> 10:56.166
It's okay, it's just water.

10:56.166 --> 10:59.583
Exactly!
It's water! Ughh!

10:59.583 --> 11:01.208
(disgusted mew)

11:01.208 --> 11:03.875
See?
Snowflake gets it.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.625
Hmm... here.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.958
Hey there, everybody!

11:09.958 --> 11:10.750
Bob! Bob!

11:10.750 --> 11:12.583
We found the kitten's owner!

11:12.583 --> 11:14.250
-(dogs barking)
-Hey, guys.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.458
(gasp)
Great gears!

11:16.458 --> 11:18.958
A lost kitty poster
blew into the yard.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.583
Huh-- Now we know
where she lives.

11:21.583 --> 11:24.583
Come on, kitty.
Let's get you home.

11:24.583 --> 11:28.125
Oh, thank you!
I looked everywhere
for you.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.416
My sweet Snowflake.

11:30.416 --> 11:32.958
I knew your name was Snowflake.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.000
Hello there, fuzzy darling.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.833
You can visit my kitten
anytime you want.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.875
So... I've gotta go now.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.291
(mew)

11:43.291 --> 11:45.416
Try not to get
tangled up in yarn,

11:45.416 --> 11:47.083
or make a mess
chasing lights,

11:47.083 --> 11:49.875
or get trapped in a tree.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.875
But if you do,

11:51.875 --> 11:53.833
I'll be around
to help you out.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.000
(mew)

11:56.958 --> 11:58.833
Huh?

11:58.833 --> 12:01.333
Sorry, Hissy.
We know you don't
wanna play with us.

12:01.333 --> 12:06.000
Actually, tossin' around
some yarn sounds like
a pretty good time.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.625
And also lights!

12:07.625 --> 12:09.416
Lights activated!

12:10.583 --> 12:14.625
(all giggling)

12:14.625 --> 12:15.333
Rolly: I'm gonna get you!

12:17.250 --> 12:18.875
(Bingo speaks)

12:21.083 --> 12:26.000
I can't tell you how excited
I am for our vacation
to Florida tomorrow!

12:26.000 --> 12:29.083
We're gonna have a blast
playing on the beach!

12:29.083 --> 12:31.458

12:36.875 --> 12:38.708
when I went to Florida
on vacation!

12:38.708 --> 12:41.708
Bob was a kid?
I always thought
Bob was a Bob.

12:41.708 --> 12:45.083
And look at that!
It's the parrot
I made friends with.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.125
When I first got to Florida,
I was feelin' homesick,

12:48.125 --> 12:49.875
and he helped me feel better.

12:49.875 --> 12:53.250
-Homesick?
-That's when you feel sad
because you miss your home.

12:53.250 --> 12:56.250
He knocked down coconuts
from coconut trees, ha!

12:56.250 --> 12:58.291
He ate grapes
right outta my hand!

12:58.291 --> 13:01.000
And he even danced
and sang songs! Ha!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.250
A coconut-getting,
grape-eating,

13:03.250 --> 13:05.875
dancing,
singing parrot? Whooo!

13:05.875 --> 13:08.166
You know, parrots can live
a long, long time.

13:08.166 --> 13:11.708
Hmm, I wonder if I'll ever
see him again?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.833
Suffering side orders
of seaweed salad!

13:14.833 --> 13:18.083

13:26.458 --> 13:28.250
Did you hear that, Rolly?

13:28.250 --> 13:31.000
Bob's right, Florida is hard
to rhyme with.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.208
Bob said we're gonna play
on the beach!

13:33.208 --> 13:36.083
My puppy tail
can't handle the excitement!

13:37.083 --> 13:38.833
(laughing)

13:38.833 --> 13:43.166
-Ahhh, Florida.
-I can't wait to play
on the beach with Bob.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.625
(sigh) Sorry, guys.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.208
The beach is gonna
have to wait.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.416
I'm not feelin' that well, so,

13:49.416 --> 13:53.000
I'm gonna rest here
until I feel better.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.875
(snoring)

13:55.875 --> 13:56.958
I don't get it.

13:56.958 --> 14:00.083
Bob was really excited
about coming to the beach.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.875
Maybe he's homesick.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.208
You know, like,
when he was a kid.

14:04.208 --> 14:07.125
That totally makes sense.
I get it.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.000
I do miss my stick collection
back home.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.125
And the backyard.
And Hissy.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.458
Excuse me,
but I am right here.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.750
I don't miss you then.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.708
'Cause you're here.
Hi, Hissy.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.333
(yawns)

14:19.333 --> 14:20.583
You're right, Rolly.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.125
The only thing that
cheered Bob up

14:22.125 --> 14:24.000
last time he was in Florida
was the parrot.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.583
I smell a mission
(sniffing) Let's go!

14:26.583 --> 14:29.416
Wait!
How are we gonna find
that parrot?

14:29.416 --> 14:33.208
Bob said that the parrot
knocked down coconuts,
and ate grapes...

14:33.208 --> 14:35.125
And danced and sang
with them.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.875
I like his parrot a lot,
and I haven't even
met him yet.

14:37.875 --> 14:41.750
So all we have to do
is find the coconut-knocking
down, grape-eating,

14:41.750 --> 14:43.250
dancing and singing parrot.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.250
Easy as kibble pie.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.750
Kibble.
Now I'm hungry.

14:46.750 --> 14:50.166
Bob did say he first met
the parrot while on a walk
in a garden.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.333
Then we should go on a walk!

14:52.333 --> 14:53.583
I love walks!

14:55.291 --> 14:56.625
With all these trees,

14:56.625 --> 14:58.625
this seems like a good place
for a bird to be.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.583
I don't see any birds.

15:00.583 --> 15:04.166
-(bird chirping)
-But I do hear one!

15:04.166 --> 15:08.083
(bird chirping)

15:10.083 --> 15:11.416
Hey, we know you!

15:11.416 --> 15:12.583
Angh!

15:12.583 --> 15:14.125
(splash)

15:14.125 --> 15:17.250
-Sorry, Nelly.
-Are you Bob's bird?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.125
-(grunts)
-Rolly, she's not a parrot.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.250
Oh, right.
I just saw wings
and got excited.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.833
What are you
doing in Florida?

15:23.833 --> 15:26.166
I came here 'cause it's warmer!

15:26.166 --> 15:28.208
Is that why
you guys are here, too?

15:28.208 --> 15:31.083
We came here on vacation
to play with Bob on the beach.

15:31.083 --> 15:34.000
Except Bob doesn't wanna play
'cause he's homesick.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.958
Now we're lookin'
for Bob's birdie friend
to help him feel better.

15:36.958 --> 15:39.291
Yeah.
Bob's bird knocks
coconuts outta trees!

15:39.291 --> 15:42.208
And eats grapes
and dances and sings!

15:42.208 --> 15:44.875
Hey! I heard a bird
singing today!

15:44.875 --> 15:46.166
I can take you to him!

15:46.166 --> 15:48.166
A singing bird?
Lead the way!

15:48.166 --> 15:50.208
Yeah, but lead the way
through that puddle.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.708
We love puddles!

15:53.000 --> 15:55.750
(splashing and giggling)

15:55.750 --> 15:58.583
The bird I heard singing
was right over there!

16:01.083 --> 16:04.000
I don't see anything
except that old,
overturned boat.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.625

Are you Bob's bird?
'Cause we heard you singing.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.083
Except Jonathan
isn't the right kind
of singing bird.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.375
He's a seagull.
Bob's bird
is a parrot.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.291
And Bob's bird knocks
coconuts outta trees.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.000
I know, I know.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.708
Ooh! Trees like that?

17:03.875 --> 17:06.458
Trees just like that!

17:06.458 --> 17:08.458
Do you see
any birds, Bingo?

used to do!

17:25.333 --> 17:28.583

Bob's bird! Bob's bird!

17:30.583 --> 17:32.708
It looks exactly
like Bob's bird!

17:32.708 --> 17:35.083
(squawk)
Bob's bird! Bob's bird!

17:35.083 --> 17:36.708
Bow to the wow,
we found him!

17:36.708 --> 17:39.458

17:44.208 --> 17:46.875
-And you too, Nelly.
-Happy to help!

17:46.875 --> 17:50.250
Hope you get Bob's bird
back to Bob so he can
feel better!

17:50.250 --> 17:53.333
Come on, Rolly!
Let's get Bob's bird
back to the hotel!

17:53.333 --> 17:55.833
Then when Bob wakes up
from his nap, he'll be all,

17:55.833 --> 17:58.750
"Hey, it's my parrot friend
from when I was little!"

17:58.750 --> 18:00.875
And then he'll feel better.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.458
Hey, Bob's bird!
Come with us to Bob's hotel.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.458
(squawk)
Bob's hotel!

18:07.458 --> 18:09.083
He's not moving.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.708
We need to figure out
how to get him to follow us.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.708
What a delightful picnic
at the beach, Frank.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.625
I just love Florida!

18:16.625 --> 18:20.375
Me too.
Except the sand
is so hard to walk on.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.625
Whoaa!

18:24.166 --> 18:26.833
Did you see that, Rolly? Grapes!

18:26.833 --> 18:29.708
Bingo, dogs aren't supposed
to eat grapes.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.416
Every puppy knows that.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.291
Not for us.
For the parrot.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.458
Bob said his bird liked grapes.

18:37.458 --> 18:40.000
We can use them
to bring him back
to Bob's hotel.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.416
Over here, Bob's bird.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.958
Look! Grapes!

18:45.958 --> 18:47.375
Yummy!

18:48.375 --> 18:49.583
(squawk)

18:51.458 --> 18:52.291
(squawk)

18:54.375 --> 18:55.708
(gulp)

18:55.708 --> 18:57.416
(squawk)
Bob's bird!

18:57.416 --> 19:00.833
Whoa!
Two parrots that both
look like Bob's bird?

19:00.833 --> 19:04.125
And now there's
a third Bob's bird!

19:04.125 --> 19:07.583
-(squawk)
-Rolly, there can only
be one Bob's bird.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.708
But which one is it?

19:09.708 --> 19:12.166
Let's ask him!
Excuse me, parrot,

19:12.166 --> 19:14.416
do you happen to be
Bob's bird?

19:14.416 --> 19:16.750
(squawk)
Bob's bird, Bob's bird!

19:16.750 --> 19:19.000
-Bob's bird!
-Bob's!

19:19.000 --> 19:23.291
Bingo, I think these parrots
are only repeating things
they've already heard us say.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.875
(squawk)
Repeating things!

19:24.875 --> 19:27.000
(squawk)
Heard us say!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.875
So when we asked
if each of 'em was Bob's bird...

19:29.875 --> 19:31.458
All parrots:
Bob's bird!

19:31.458 --> 19:32.958
(squawk)
Repeating things.

19:32.958 --> 19:35.208
Bob's bird!

19:35.208 --> 19:37.708
How are we gonna figure out
which one is the one
that's the one?

19:37.708 --> 19:40.250
Bob's bird also sang and danced.

19:40.250 --> 19:44.083
Whichever one sings
and dances must be Bob's bird!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.250
Anyone of you guys
like to sing and dance?

19:48.500 --> 19:50.625
Bob's bird!

19:50.625 --> 19:52.708
You know, dancing?

19:52.708 --> 19:56.500
(upbeat drums)

19:58.708 --> 20:00.000
Nothing?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.958
Tough crowd. (sighs)

20:01.958 --> 20:04.500
I think Bob's bird
might need a little
inspiration.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.083
We need to sing and dance.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.250
And maybe Bob's bird
will decide to join us!

20:09.250 --> 20:10.416
You don't have to ask me twice!

20:13.375 --> 20:14.833

21:10.708 --> 21:12.625
That first one sang pretty well.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.583
And so did both the others.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.625
They're all good dancers, too.

21:16.625 --> 21:19.416
Yeah, I don't know how
we can know which one
is the best one

21:19.416 --> 21:21.583
that's supposed to be
Bob's bird.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.083
That was a mouthful.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.250
Bob could wake up
at any time.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.000
Without his bird,
he won't feel better.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.708
Argh!
This is so frustrating!

21:30.708 --> 21:32.291
Frustrating!

21:32.291 --> 21:35.750
(squawk)
Suffering side orders
of seaweed salad! (squawk)

21:35.750 --> 21:37.000
What did he say?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
He said the same thing Bob says
when he's frustrated!

21:40.000 --> 21:42.583
Suffering side orders
of seaweed salad!

21:42.583 --> 21:43.583
Seaweed salad!

21:43.583 --> 21:45.375
But the only way
he'd know to say that

21:45.375 --> 21:46.458
is if he heard Bob say it!

21:46.458 --> 21:48.458
Which means he did hear
Bob say it!

21:48.458 --> 21:50.250
When Bob was a kid!

21:50.250 --> 21:51.958
Bob's bird!

21:51.958 --> 21:53.583
We figured it out, Rolly!

21:53.583 --> 21:56.000
High paw!
Come on, Bob's bird!

21:56.000 --> 21:58.583
Let's get you back to Bob
so we can surprise him!

21:58.583 --> 22:01.416
Back to Bob! Surprise!

22:03.208 --> 22:05.583
Bye-bye other parrots
that are not Bob's bird!

22:05.583 --> 22:07.208
Not Bob's bird!

22:07.208 --> 22:09.458
-Hey, Bob!
-Wake up!
We have a surprise for you!

22:10.958 --> 22:13.625
(dogs barking)

22:13.625 --> 22:16.875
(yawns)
Oh... ha-- Hey, there, fellas!

22:16.875 --> 22:19.166
What are you two
so excited about?

22:19.166 --> 22:20.625
Parrot:
Hey, there, fellas!

22:20.625 --> 22:21.708
(squawk)

22:21.708 --> 22:24.458
Wait-- Is that who
I think it is?

22:24.458 --> 22:27.208
Why, I'd recognize
that voice anywhere.

22:27.208 --> 22:29.583
Bob's bird! Bob's bird!

22:31.625 --> 22:33.208
(squawk)

22:33.208 --> 22:34.375
Look at you!

22:34.375 --> 22:35.583
Ha-ha-ha!

22:35.583 --> 22:38.708
Look at you!
Ra-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

22:38.708 --> 22:41.125
Ho-ho... I can't believe it.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.458
Good job, guys.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.625
We did it, Rolly!

22:46.625 --> 22:50.375
I'm singin' and dancin',
and-- Whaaaoww!

22:50.375 --> 22:51.875
Ow!

22:51.875 --> 22:54.833
-Suffering side orders--
-Of seaweed salad!

22:54.833 --> 22:56.125
(squawk)

22:56.125 --> 22:58.458
(laughs)
You know what, pups?

22:58.458 --> 23:02.000
I feel so good, I feel like
goin' to the beach!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.583
Yay! We're going to the beach!

23:03.583 --> 23:04.583
With Bob!

23:04.583 --> 23:08.166
(all laughing)

23:08.166 --> 23:10.208
Go long, fellas!

23:10.208 --> 23:11.708
Parrot:
Go long!

23:12.833 --> 23:15.750
-I'm gonna get it first!
-Nuh-uh! I got this!

23:15.750 --> 23:18.500
-Huh!
-(both giggling)

23:21.416 --> 23:23.833
(squawk)
Bob's pups, Bob's pups!

23:23.833 --> 23:25.458
Yeah, we are!

23:32.708 --> 23:35.708
(theme music playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:36.833
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.208
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.708 --> 23:46.375
(record scratching)

23:52.416 --> 23:53.458
Bark!

23:56.750 --> 23:57.875
Bark! Bark! Bark!
