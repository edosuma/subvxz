WEBVTT

00:13.547 --> 00:15.378
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.446
Back inside, go.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.084
Go! Go!

00:53.254 --> 00:54.619
Everybody on the floor.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.550
Don't be a hero.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.538
Watch me close, watch me close.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.275
Choose the two or the three,
you lose.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.444
Choose the queen, win some green.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.955
All right, fifth time's a charm.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.455
- Man.
- Sorry, son,

01:34.628 --> 01:35.686
you picked the wrong one.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.194
Hey, Dr. Seuss, keep it down.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.129
What? The kid is nice.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.165
Kid is corny.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.997
Deeks is flimflamming
the support staff.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.365
No, no, what I found
was an entry point to a drug ring

01:46.573 --> 01:48.632
through a low-level thug
with a gambling problem.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.869
And what I'm doing is sharpening
my skill set to set the trap.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.706
Because you gotta captivate
the mark's eyes and ears

01:57.885 --> 02:00.115
with what you're doing
with your mouth

02:00.321 --> 02:02.289
but also with your hands.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.854
Captivate, not irritate.

02:05.492 --> 02:06.686
I'm game.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.794
Oh. Money on the wood
makes the bet go good.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.123
Money out of sight, take a hike.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.698
- This I gotta see.
- Uncle Marty throws them fast.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.334
Uncle Marty here to last.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.628
Uncle Marty?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.031
Beyond creepy.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.174
What you got?

02:26.513 --> 02:28.208
Ooh.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.510
Okay, okay, beginner's luck.
That's fine.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.684
You know, I'm feeling lucky.
Double or nothing.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.857
Double or...

02:38.025 --> 02:39.049
You wanna...

02:40.661 --> 02:42.094
All right, let's do it.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.662
Okay, no, no, no. I want in on this.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.232
Let's see, we have one, two...

02:47.401 --> 02:49.835
You know what? Just all in.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.999
You wanna bet all that?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.868
Because that's a lot of twenties.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.703
All right, okay.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.437
You know what? Let's do it. Ho!

03:00.547 --> 03:02.378
Coming at you hard
and I'm coming at you fast.

03:02.549 --> 03:06.178
Uncle Marty bringing the hurt.
Uncle Marty about to take your shirt.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.253
What you got? Hm?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.400
You sure?

03:22.669 --> 03:24.296
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it is.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.938
- Thank you.
- Who is the loser?

03:26.106 --> 03:27.664
Who is the loser?
Are you the loser?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.105
I threw it to the...
How did you not know that...?

03:30.277 --> 03:34.304
You may wanna try hustling upstairs
instead of each other.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.948
There's a situation downtown.

03:37.117 --> 03:42.282
And I don't appreciate you coercing
Miss Jones into your shenanigans.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.321
X-ray was her idea.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.993
Oh. All right, all right, yeah.
Yeah, joke's over.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.191
I need the money back
because everybody's in on this but me,

03:55.402 --> 03:58.428
which makes it super not awesome.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.412
The kid is nice indeed.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.643
- What are we looking at, Eric?
- Looks like a protest situation

04:12.820 --> 04:14.913
at a Navy recruitment center
downtown.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.017
Human barricade.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.317
Protest turned into
a hostage situation.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.655
Oh, here come the sharks.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.457
Recruitment center
downtown hostage.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.429
I think that we see the SWAT team
is now just getting into...

04:27.601 --> 04:30.001
What do we know about the guy
who took the hostages?

04:31.004 --> 04:33.165
Not a guy, a woman.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.940
- You know her?
- You could say that.

04:38.145 --> 04:41.171
The woman has just been identified
as a Tracy Keller,

04:41.348 --> 04:43.316
a Valley Village soccer mom.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.884
The number of hostages
is still unclear.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.116
Oh, this is weird.
According to the military database,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.951
there's no Tracy Keller
listed as next of kin.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.883
That's because the name is an alias.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.124
An alias for who?

04:58.765 --> 05:00.790
My ex-wife.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.711
We were in the CIA.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.813
We went undercover
as husband and wife.

05:16.048 --> 05:17.379
Anything we should know?

05:17.816 --> 05:19.716
She's smart.

05:19.885 --> 05:22.115
Not just good grades,
I mean other-level intelligence.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.721
IQ's over 140.

05:24.256 --> 05:26.383
Mm. Not that smart.

05:27.326 --> 05:30.295
She must have missed
the Sniper Awareness course.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.656
Yeah, Nell's right.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.821
She's putting herself at risk
of a sniper's bullet

05:33.999 --> 05:35.432
with all that window gawking.

05:35.634 --> 05:37.431
Almost like she's posing
for the cameras.

05:38.103 --> 05:39.798
She seems way too hot for you.

05:42.074 --> 05:43.803
What? I'm just saying.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.274
- You keep in touch?
- No.

05:46.478 --> 05:50.107
She retired, last I heard.
That was five years ago.

05:50.316 --> 05:54.275
Undercover agents don't retire,
they just go deeper.

05:54.453 --> 05:56.785
You guys ever consider
putting a bell around her neck?

05:56.989 --> 05:59.116
Many people have tried, Mr. Deeks.

05:59.925 --> 06:02.257
How does she hear that?

06:02.461 --> 06:05.919
Question is,
if she retired five years ago,

06:06.098 --> 06:09.659
why is she using her old alias?

06:10.336 --> 06:12.031
Because that's
a Navy recruitment center

06:12.271 --> 06:14.603
and somehow she's figured out
I'm NCIS.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.540
She's trying to contact me.

06:17.776 --> 06:19.835
Or she's taken
a recruitment center hostage.

06:20.012 --> 06:24.676
No, Tracy Keller was her alias
only when we went undercover.

06:33.859 --> 06:35.690
She looks like she's running away
from home.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.324
- You got this?
- I'm good.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.294
Don't take candy
from any strangers.

06:48.674 --> 06:51.142
So Tracy Keller.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.971
What's her real name?

06:53.145 --> 06:55.477
I only knew her as Tracy.

06:55.647 --> 06:58.377
- What happened between you two?
- Long story.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.347
Give me the short version.

07:01.553 --> 07:03.544
If she wasn't central to this case,
I'd let it go,

07:03.722 --> 07:05.587
but since she is, I need to know.

07:05.791 --> 07:09.386
Let's say she's the kind of person that
chooses the mission over her partner.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.332
Well, let me get the lay of the land,
see what I can dig up.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.799
Maybe Uncle Marty can hustle
L.A.P.D. Into letting us take over.

07:18.303 --> 07:19.827
I'll take Kensi.

07:20.005 --> 07:22.045
I just need to get some
of that money back that l...

07:22.174 --> 07:24.108
Never gonna happen.

07:26.311 --> 07:28.711
What do you want, Deeks?
I'm busy with a situation.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.348
This is Agent Callen, NCIS.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.782
My men are already in position.

07:32.951 --> 07:35.351
I may have some inside information
on the suspect.

07:36.422 --> 07:39.448
- At least let me make first contact.
- Well, she's not communicating.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.458
As soon as I get the orders,
we're going to breach.

07:51.236 --> 07:53.363
You got ten minutes.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.030
If you're still in there when we breach,
I'm not responsible.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.573
Done.

07:58.343 --> 07:59.640
I owe you.

08:01.213 --> 08:02.578
Yep.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.107
What'd you say to him?

08:05.284 --> 08:07.809
There's this rule about not dating
the captain's daughter.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.079
- He broke it.
- All over the captain's desk.

08:10.856 --> 08:12.483
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.491
Tough perimeter to enforce.
Plenty of holes if we wanna get in.

08:15.727 --> 08:16.751
No need.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.123
Deeks came through.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.993
- The kid is nice.
- Condescension noted.

08:23.735 --> 08:26.135
It's for her protection, not mine.

08:26.305 --> 08:29.274
I'm still upset over her getting the dog
in the settlement.

08:30.642 --> 08:32.610
What's the distress word?

08:33.312 --> 08:34.802
Buddy.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.140
I always loved that dog.

08:41.653 --> 08:43.678
- You ready, Eric?
- Ready.

08:43.889 --> 08:45.288
Nell?

08:45.457 --> 08:47.254
I'm good.

08:47.659 --> 08:48.751
Here we go.

08:48.927 --> 08:51.293
- Three.
- Two.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.021
One.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.432
- What?
- Wait, we lost the signal.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.125
Looks like we're down, you guys.

08:57.302 --> 08:59.634
You got 30 seconds
till they're back online again.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.766
Camera phones in the crowd?

09:03.942 --> 09:07.434
Too far away for anyone
to get a high-res image.

09:09.414 --> 09:11.541
Well done, Mr. Beale.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.117
You too, Miss Jones.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.429
Still fashionably late, I see.

09:29.635 --> 09:30.693
Hello, Tracy.

09:30.936 --> 09:32.801
Callen.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.430
You look good.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.167
Having a shotgun pointed at me
tends to bring out my natural glow.

09:39.344 --> 09:40.868
Sorry.

09:41.046 --> 09:42.980
Had to make sure.

09:43.815 --> 09:46.750
- I haven't seen you since...
- Uzbekistan.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.189
Heard you retired.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.223
Sort of.

09:55.894 --> 09:58.328
Did a stint with the Bureau.

09:59.264 --> 10:01.596
Now I'm in the private sector.

10:06.104 --> 10:07.833
So all this to get my attention.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.575
Why didn't you just call? Text?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.745
Oh, texting is so last week.

10:13.912 --> 10:15.539
And hostage situations
are all the rage?

10:15.981 --> 10:18.006
Well, given my current situation,

10:18.183 --> 10:20.879
it was the only way I knew
how to contact you.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.247
What situation?

10:24.756 --> 10:28.487
Whatever happened to us, huh?
We used to be great together.

10:28.694 --> 10:32.494
My meticulous planning
paired with your gift of improvisation.

10:33.098 --> 10:34.292
We were unbeatable.

10:34.499 --> 10:36.865
I absolutely agree. Heh.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.902
We were great
till you hung me out to dry.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.274
You never let me explain.

10:43.508 --> 10:44.873
Explain what?

10:45.043 --> 10:47.876
It was a crappy thing
to do to your partner.

10:48.046 --> 10:49.274
To me.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.308
I don't quite remember it that way.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.450
Regardless...

10:57.289 --> 10:58.916
I need your help.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.449
Whenever you're ready.

11:04.229 --> 11:06.129
You have to know
I didn't have a choice.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.725
- They're hunting me.
- Who?

11:10.669 --> 11:12.068
The United Brotherhood Party.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.305
They chased me in here.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.667
The white supremacists?

11:18.410 --> 11:21.072
I'm gonna need your earwig
and your cell phone.

11:21.913 --> 11:23.039
Don't do it, G.

11:34.159 --> 11:35.649
Kensi, Deeks, we're blind.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.294
I'm setting up the laser mike now.

11:39.464 --> 11:41.625
Just so you know,
my boss is gonna bill you for that.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.597
I was working undercover,

11:43.769 --> 11:47.136
trying to recoup a shipment of stolen
Spike missiles from the Brotherhood.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.297
The plan went awry
and they're trying to kill me.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.341
- Undercover for who?
- Like I said, private sector.

11:52.577 --> 11:55.808
Why don't you just call your people?
Have them bring you in from the cold?

11:56.014 --> 11:58.312
Because right now,
I'm not sure who I can trust.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.451
And you think you can trust me?

12:01.586 --> 12:03.816
I could always trust you, Callen.

12:04.022 --> 12:05.512
Yeah.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.316
That's me.

12:07.492 --> 12:08.584
Trustworthy.

12:11.029 --> 12:13.395
I'm sorry I can't say the same.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.360
I'm gonna need something
a little more tangible.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.164
There's a warehouse.
Fourth and Hill.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.740
Dead Brotherhood member
shot twice in the chest.

12:24.609 --> 12:26.702
That should be tangible
enough, huh?

12:32.384 --> 12:34.011
- Go.
- Sam, there's a body.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.347
Fourth and Hill,
Kensi and Deeks are on the way.

12:36.521 --> 12:39.547
G, you trust her?

12:42.160 --> 12:43.252
I'm not sure.

12:51.269 --> 12:53.100
What happened at the warehouse?

12:53.271 --> 12:55.239
I was following up a lead.

12:55.407 --> 12:58.672
Next thing I knew, bullets were flying.
Had to shoot my way out.

12:58.877 --> 13:00.936
You used to be a better shot.

13:01.146 --> 13:02.943
Back in the day, they'd all be dead.

13:04.182 --> 13:05.843
Back in the day,
I used to have a partner

13:06.017 --> 13:08.451
I could depend on to have my back.

13:15.394 --> 13:19.228
So how far do you think Callen
and this Tracy lady

13:19.398 --> 13:22.026
took their whole
"pretending to be married" thing?

13:22.200 --> 13:24.862
I don't know, use your imagination.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.867
On second thought, don't.

13:27.038 --> 13:29.404
Mm. Too late.

13:29.574 --> 13:32.702
Wait, so just out of curiosity,

13:32.878 --> 13:36.245
unh, what happened
to your last partner?

13:39.451 --> 13:41.180
He met an unfortunate end.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.756
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.387
Go.

13:52.097 --> 13:55.089
- How many partners have you had?
- Why?

13:55.267 --> 13:57.167
You know, just wondering.

13:57.335 --> 14:01.271
I'm just wondering if you're like
the Elizabeth Taylor of partners.

14:02.307 --> 14:03.968
- Deeks.
- What?

14:04.142 --> 14:05.939
- Focus.
- Well, I'm trying.

14:06.111 --> 14:09.638
I have the right to know if you got, like,
partner poison or something, right?

14:09.815 --> 14:12.113
I mean, do they call you
"Kiss of Death" Kensi,

14:12.284 --> 14:17.847
or "Bad Luck" Blye,
or, I don't know, a widow-maker?

14:18.590 --> 14:20.114
Dead guy, Deeks.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.850
See, that's not funny.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.520
Not you, you idiot.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.655
Oh, hey, yeah, dead guy.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.500
Well-dressed dead guy.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.436
Reminds me more of the guy
that denied me a Jet Ski loan

14:38.610 --> 14:40.339
than a white supremacist.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.372
It's because he's not.

14:43.648 --> 14:44.945
He's FBI.

15:12.843 --> 15:15.368
- Yeah.
- Callen, we've got a body here.

15:15.546 --> 15:18.606
Took two center-mass, but he's not
a member of the Brotherhood.

15:18.782 --> 15:20.044
He's FBI.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.679
Special Agent Rick Timmons.

15:23.854 --> 15:25.719
Okay, thanks.

15:27.891 --> 15:29.188
Did they find the body?

15:29.359 --> 15:31.122
Just like you said.

15:32.563 --> 15:35.088
Except he wasn't a white supremacist,
he was FBI.

15:36.266 --> 15:38.734
Agent Rick Timmons?

15:38.936 --> 15:40.927
Tell me you didn't know he was FBI.

15:42.372 --> 15:46.103
I didn't know. Not for sure.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.143
If you want my help,
I need the truth now.

15:58.956 --> 16:01.083
Three weeks ago,
my ex-partner at the FBI

16:01.258 --> 16:04.785
was killed in a shoot-out
while investigating the Brotherhood.

16:04.962 --> 16:08.022
Now the Bureau says they don't have
enough evidence to charge anyone.

16:08.565 --> 16:12.023
What, so you're doing
your own private-sector investigation?

16:12.936 --> 16:14.403
We were partners.

16:14.605 --> 16:16.300
Just partners?

16:17.674 --> 16:21.303
It's been a long time
since I let anyone get that close.

16:23.781 --> 16:24.975
What, you don't believe me?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.618
I saw the surveillance footage.

16:28.786 --> 16:32.153
- You weren't followed.
- You don't know that for sure.

16:33.090 --> 16:34.682
You have to help me get out of here.

16:36.593 --> 16:39.323
I can take you to our safe house,
discuss your options.

16:39.496 --> 16:42.431
- It won't work. They'll find me there.
- Take it or leave it.

16:42.599 --> 16:44.639
- I guess I'll leave it.
- I guess I can't help you.

16:46.837 --> 16:49.067
If I step foot outside, they'll kill me.

16:56.213 --> 16:57.441
Please, Callen.

16:58.816 --> 17:00.374
Okay.

17:00.717 --> 17:02.446
I'll stay.

17:05.189 --> 17:07.214
Let the hostages go.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.015
Got the floor plans, Eric, thanks.

17:09.193 --> 17:11.525
Are you NCIS?

17:11.895 --> 17:13.453
Agent John White, FBI.

17:13.664 --> 17:15.632
Sam Hanna. FBI taking over?

17:15.799 --> 17:17.790
It's a federal building,
but L.A.P.D.'s in place.

17:17.968 --> 17:20.232
We don't wanna open any windows
during the transition.

17:20.404 --> 17:23.099
- I've got a man in there.
- You wanna tell me how?

17:23.307 --> 17:24.705
Our guy worked with her once.

17:26.042 --> 17:27.510
You missing any of your agents?

17:27.711 --> 17:29.235
As a matter of fact.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.213
We found a body four blocks
from here with FBI credentials.

17:33.383 --> 17:34.873
That's Agent Timmons.

17:35.719 --> 17:37.687
His wife just had a kid.

17:37.888 --> 17:40.379
Woman inside
says she shot him in self-defense.

17:40.557 --> 17:41.922
Wanna tell me what this is about?

17:43.894 --> 17:45.725
Her real name's Tracy Rosetti.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.488
Former FBI.

17:47.664 --> 17:51.065
We're pretty sure she's connected
with an arms dealer on the watch list,

17:51.235 --> 17:53.829
James Thomas Mason.

17:54.004 --> 17:56.768
This is a delicate situation,
Agent Hanna.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.033
- We can't afford to screw it up.
- Here they come.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.177
My guy managed
the release of the hostages.

18:04.348 --> 18:06.441
I'll take that kind
of screwup any day.

18:07.551 --> 18:08.711
I'm gonna suggest we breach.

18:08.886 --> 18:11.719
I'll give you a heads-up
so you can get your man out.

18:11.922 --> 18:13.583
Appreciate it.

18:16.693 --> 18:18.923
- Who's the suit?
- FBI.

18:19.463 --> 18:20.725
G is running out of time.

18:24.801 --> 18:28.259
That was awesome.
I wasn't even sure it would work.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.065
We make a good team.

18:35.045 --> 18:37.479
You two can rest
on your laurels later.

18:37.981 --> 18:41.280
What have you got
on the arms dealer Mason?

18:41.985 --> 18:44.977
James Thomas Mason,
international arms dealer.

18:45.222 --> 18:48.885
Suspected involvement
in the Tuareg Rebellion in '07,

18:49.059 --> 18:51.220
Andean diplomatic crisis in '08,

18:51.395 --> 18:55.263
and for arming both sides
of the Mexican drug war.

18:55.465 --> 18:59.265
He entered the country three days ago,
but Homeland lost his tail shortly after.

18:59.436 --> 19:01.927
- Well, assist Homeland in finding him.
- I'm on it.

19:02.139 --> 19:05.131
What did you find
on the Spike missiles?

19:06.076 --> 19:09.603
Mason is rumored to be responsible
for a shipment of Spike missiles

19:09.780 --> 19:11.680
that were hijacked from China Lake.

19:11.848 --> 19:15.716
It's the smallest guided missile
in the world, but it packs a big punch.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.853
Easy to deploy and versatile.

19:18.088 --> 19:19.419
A gunner at a remote location

19:19.589 --> 19:24.583
can switch targets or abort an attack
while the missile is in flight.

19:24.795 --> 19:27.423
Each missile uses
a computer-coded SIM card

19:27.597 --> 19:28.689
to program targeting,

19:28.865 --> 19:31.333
making the missiles accurate
to within inches.

19:31.501 --> 19:32.661
In the wrong hands...

19:32.869 --> 19:35.497
Callen and Sam
getting this information?

19:35.739 --> 19:37.263
Streaming live
to their smart phones.

19:45.315 --> 19:48.148
There's an L.A.P.D. SWAT team
out there ready to take you out.

19:48.785 --> 19:50.776
It can't be worse
than what's already out there.

19:50.988 --> 19:53.149
- What are they waiting for?
- Me.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.552
I'm giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

19:56.026 --> 19:57.152
For now.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.625
Just like old times, huh?

19:59.830 --> 20:01.855
Me, you and...

20:02.666 --> 20:05.191
What was the name of that mangy
old dog you loved so much?

20:08.405 --> 20:10.373
Kensi, Deeks,
shooter on the roof opposite.

20:10.574 --> 20:12.132
Take the front.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.078
Eric, I need a back door
out of here fast.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.418
Buddy. His name was Buddy.

20:24.521 --> 20:27.786
Uh, FYI, SWAT is breaching.

20:28.525 --> 20:30.083
- Callen?
- Got it.

20:30.293 --> 20:32.090
We gotta move fast.

20:44.307 --> 20:45.934
Unh. Federal agent.

21:09.599 --> 21:11.362
He's L.A.P.D.

21:12.569 --> 21:14.469
You killed a cop.

21:25.014 --> 21:26.174
- Back up!
- Back up.

21:26.382 --> 21:27.872
- Back up!
- Take it easy.

21:28.084 --> 21:29.949
Easy, guys, guys, calm down,
settle down.

21:30.186 --> 21:33.053
Screw you, Deeks.
Your buddy shot one of ours.

21:33.222 --> 21:35.782
I did not shoot this guy.

21:36.259 --> 21:37.556
- Are we good?
- I'm good.

21:37.727 --> 21:39.558
They're the ones with the problem.

21:45.568 --> 21:47.433
Powder burns. Come here.

21:48.170 --> 21:52.197
Tissue damage from perforations
of unburned grains of gunpowder.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.865
This guy was shot at close range.

21:54.043 --> 21:56.603
I was at least 50 meters
when I took the shot.

21:59.181 --> 22:00.808
Took the shot from there.

22:00.983 --> 22:02.974
I missed.

22:06.389 --> 22:08.448
The shooter got away.

22:09.558 --> 22:11.219
I didn't shoot your man, guys.

22:11.394 --> 22:13.487
Target not
acquired. There's no one in there, sir.

22:13.696 --> 22:15.687
What do you mean,
no one's in there?

22:16.132 --> 22:17.326
She's gone, sir.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.961
- I thought your guy was good.
- I never said that.

22:21.137 --> 22:22.627
He thinks he's good.
He's really not.

22:23.506 --> 22:25.770
As soon as you hear from him,
call me.

22:25.975 --> 22:28.569
- If he's still alive.
- Will do.

22:44.727 --> 22:45.989
Nice move.

22:46.462 --> 22:47.622
Run into any resistance?

22:47.830 --> 22:49.161
Just from her.

22:49.365 --> 22:51.299
A little reluctant
to give up her weapons.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.435
You sure know how to pick them.

22:53.602 --> 22:56.264
She was right about one thing.
Somebody wants to take her out.

22:56.806 --> 22:58.797
How do you wanna handle it?

22:59.041 --> 23:01.601
Like a hostile divorce hearing.

23:02.044 --> 23:03.841
Last chance,
you either tell us everything

23:04.013 --> 23:06.243
or we turn you over to the FBI.

23:06.449 --> 23:10.010
I already told you everything.
And I want my stuff back.

23:10.186 --> 23:11.949
You know,
for a person with such a high IQ,

23:12.121 --> 23:13.816
you're not being very smart.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.456
Have it your way.

23:19.395 --> 23:21.124
Sam, call Agent White.

23:21.297 --> 23:23.060
Tell him where he can find her.

23:23.299 --> 23:25.324
Wait.

23:29.772 --> 23:31.740
The FBI was running
an undercover sting

23:31.907 --> 23:33.772
based on a tip that they received.

23:35.044 --> 23:37.569
But it was bigger
than anyone realized.

23:37.780 --> 23:40.010
The Brotherhood tried to buy
stolen Spike missiles

23:40.182 --> 23:41.410
from an arms dealer.

23:41.650 --> 23:42.981
James Thomas Mason.

23:43.652 --> 23:44.744
Mason acquired the Spikes,

23:44.920 --> 23:48.048
but he didn't have the computer-coded
SIM cards needed to activate them.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.884
Without the SIM cards,
the Spikes are useless.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.688
With them, they're worth millions.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.761
The agents running the sting
pulled some strings

23:59.935 --> 24:02.665
to get the missing SIM cards.

24:03.239 --> 24:05.673
Plan was to sell them to Mason
and retire with the money.

24:05.875 --> 24:08.105
How many agents
are we talking about?

24:08.611 --> 24:11.808
- At least three.
- And you know this how, Tracy?

24:18.754 --> 24:20.346
You know me.

24:20.556 --> 24:23.218
I will stay here all night.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.360
One of the agents
was Walter Stone.

24:28.931 --> 24:31.058
My ex-partner.

24:34.403 --> 24:36.268
He engineered the whole thing.

24:36.472 --> 24:38.940
- Why didn't you tell us this?
- Hence the ten-year rule.

24:40.376 --> 24:43.436
You should know your partner for at
least ten years prior to marrying them.

24:43.612 --> 24:44.636
Why would I do that?

24:44.847 --> 24:47.907
You date me for a decade,
you deserve my hand in marriage.

24:48.084 --> 24:49.415
I'm not sure what to make of it.

24:49.585 --> 24:51.985
That sounds so much more
like a punishment than a reward.

24:52.154 --> 24:53.883
It all happened so fast.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.650
Did it just slip your mind
to mention that your FBI boyfriend

24:56.859 --> 24:58.383
was involved in an illegal arms deal?

24:58.561 --> 25:00.722
Hey, I was trying
to figure things out.

25:01.297 --> 25:03.390
I know how this looks.

25:03.566 --> 25:05.557
I just needed time to think.

25:05.768 --> 25:07.429
Where are the SIM cards now?

25:08.804 --> 25:10.066
Walter had them.

25:10.239 --> 25:12.571
I found them in a warehouse
they used as a meeting place.

25:12.741 --> 25:16.074
As I was leaving, I was attacked
and I had to shoot my way out.

25:16.512 --> 25:18.776
I didn't know who to trust
so I turned to you.

25:18.948 --> 25:20.677
Need the names.

25:24.787 --> 25:26.516
All night, Tracy.

25:27.089 --> 25:28.488
Agent John White.

25:30.426 --> 25:33.452
He was the one who shut down
the investigation into Walter's death.

25:33.929 --> 25:35.021
You got proof?

25:37.967 --> 25:40.197
My word isn't good enough for you?

25:44.206 --> 25:46.470
White needs the SIM cards
to complete the arms deal.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.302
Where are they, Tracy?

25:49.445 --> 25:51.037
They're in a safe place.

25:53.315 --> 25:55.977
They're the last bargaining chip
I have, Callen.

26:05.494 --> 26:07.724
If White needs the SIM cards
to complete the deal,

26:07.930 --> 26:10.728
why try to kill the one person
who knows where they are?

26:10.933 --> 26:13.834
Assuming she's telling the truth,
White either found the SIM cards

26:14.036 --> 26:16.732
or he panicked, tried to take her out
before she started talking.

26:16.972 --> 26:19.338
- Hey, you guys got a moment?
- Little busy, Eric.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.032
You're gonna wanna see this.

26:21.210 --> 26:24.737
I grabbed the security footage
off a database

26:24.947 --> 26:26.972
that you guys
are better off not knowing about.

26:27.149 --> 26:29.379
Taken from the roof
opposite the recruitment center.

26:29.585 --> 26:31.985
That's the L.A.P.D. Sniper.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.956
- It's Agent White.
- She was telling the truth.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.389
That'd be a first.

26:44.700 --> 26:49.103
Guys, hang on.
White doesn't know we're onto him.

26:50.472 --> 26:52.099
We need to draw him out.

26:52.341 --> 26:53.968
The code cards get us White.

26:54.176 --> 26:56.076
White gets us Mason,
the arms dealer.

26:56.245 --> 26:58.213
Mason gets us the missiles.

27:13.062 --> 27:14.689
Let's say we buy your story...

27:16.899 --> 27:18.196
You have proof.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.295
Surveillance cameras.

27:25.374 --> 27:26.807
You're going to contact White.

27:27.543 --> 27:30.512
Tell him you have the code cards
and you wanna make a deal.

27:30.713 --> 27:32.578
Convince him you gave us the slip.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.016
Done.

27:39.021 --> 27:41.819
Then you're gonna tell us
where the cards really are.

27:48.297 --> 27:49.924
I've been lonely.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.481
What is she singing?

28:09.652 --> 28:11.017
Our wedding song.

28:11.186 --> 28:13.051
Lee Williams & the Cymbals.

28:13.255 --> 28:15.348
You got married
to Lee Williams & the Cymbals?

28:15.557 --> 28:17.491
Hey, it was a fake wedding, okay?

28:17.693 --> 28:18.990
Getting pretty sunny out here.

28:19.161 --> 28:21.561
- You want me to, uh...?
- You can't put any sunscreen on me.

28:23.098 --> 28:24.122
How did you...?

28:26.001 --> 28:27.832
Guys, heads up. Here comes White.

28:37.146 --> 28:39.444
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.112
You miked?

28:46.322 --> 28:47.584
No.

28:50.359 --> 28:51.451
Wow.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.686
I usually only get to frisk, like,
meth heads and dirty hookers.

28:56.365 --> 28:57.992
Been going over this thing
in my head.

28:58.167 --> 28:59.657
Get in the water.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.665
Now.

29:17.353 --> 29:18.411
There goes our mike.

29:18.620 --> 29:22.147
Yeah, but her hotness meter
just went up like a bajillion points.

29:24.326 --> 29:25.554
Do we have a laser mike?

29:25.728 --> 29:26.820
It wouldn't work.

29:26.995 --> 29:28.715
Too much distortion
from the crashing waves.

29:28.764 --> 29:30.857
Kensi, can you read them?

29:33.035 --> 29:34.229
I lost the visual.

29:34.436 --> 29:35.926
I'm moving in.

29:36.572 --> 29:39.405
You and Timmons killed Walter
so you could keep the money.

29:39.641 --> 29:41.506
It's an interesting theory.

29:41.677 --> 29:44.009
Actually, Timmons was next.

29:44.179 --> 29:46.647
You took care of that for me.

29:46.849 --> 29:50.012
It's too bad Walter never told you
where we were meeting Mason.

29:50.185 --> 29:51.675
You could have retired in comfort.

29:54.957 --> 29:56.151
Where are the damn codes?

29:58.694 --> 29:59.956
- Federal agent.
- Unh!

30:04.767 --> 30:05.791
No!

30:26.287 --> 30:27.686
What the hell, Tracy?

30:27.855 --> 30:29.720
He killed an FBI agent and a cop.

30:29.891 --> 30:31.085
The world's a better place.

30:31.292 --> 30:33.522
I disarmed him.
There was no threat.

30:33.995 --> 30:36.657
Walter said he always carried
a backup in an ankle holster.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.461
You can believe what you want
but he was going for that gun.

30:44.205 --> 30:45.297
You're wrong.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.578
With White dead, there goes
our meeting with the arms dealer.

30:51.746 --> 30:53.475
Maybe not.

31:01.255 --> 31:04.486
Here. San Pedro
Container Yard, 3:00.

31:04.659 --> 31:06.388
We've got an hour
to recover those missiles

31:06.627 --> 31:09.687
before they figure out how to use them
on some federal building.

31:13.701 --> 31:16.829
- We'd better hurry.
- Now that's the man I married.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.108
- What do you have in mind?
- We go in as Walter and Tracy.

31:22.276 --> 31:24.244
How do we know Mason
hasn't seen these guys?

31:24.445 --> 31:27.881
Walter said Mason was unpredictable.
He didn't trust anyone.

31:28.583 --> 31:32.451
Identity was a concern so they handled
all communication electronically.

31:33.087 --> 31:35.078
It's a risk we're gonna have to take.

31:35.289 --> 31:36.415
Works for me.

31:37.191 --> 31:38.886
Not you.

31:41.796 --> 31:43.388
Just like old times.

31:51.472 --> 31:54.202
Service road from the south
is the likeliest entry point.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.434
It runs parallel
through the entire property.

31:56.611 --> 31:58.135
Okay, fanning out from the east

31:58.312 --> 32:01.406
is gonna give us the best shot
to cover the road.

32:05.286 --> 32:07.413
It's fully operational.

32:18.065 --> 32:19.794
Testing.

32:20.735 --> 32:21.997
Testing.

32:23.805 --> 32:26.000
Care to help a girl out?

32:52.333 --> 32:55.530
The coded SIM cards that arm
the missiles were where Tracy said.

32:55.736 --> 32:56.760
Impressive.

32:56.938 --> 32:59.930
Now we just have to keep them out
of Mason's hands.

33:00.608 --> 33:02.667
Can I talk to you for a second?

33:11.786 --> 33:13.048
Is he gonna be okay?

33:13.254 --> 33:15.119
You worry about Deeks. G's cool.

33:15.289 --> 33:16.517
What?

33:16.691 --> 33:18.022
I'm cool too.

33:18.626 --> 33:20.651
I appreciate you
trusting me back there.

33:21.395 --> 33:23.488
That's what partners do.

33:24.265 --> 33:26.495
I never stopped caring.

33:27.001 --> 33:29.299
I tried to reach you.

33:30.071 --> 33:31.265
You never let me explain.

33:31.806 --> 33:35.037
You made it pretty clear
where your head and heart were at.

33:35.476 --> 33:37.341
I was young.

33:37.678 --> 33:39.669
Ambitious.

33:40.214 --> 33:42.182
I made a mistake.

33:43.484 --> 33:45.418
One that I regret.

33:47.722 --> 33:49.553
It doesn't matter anymore.

33:53.060 --> 33:56.393
Remember when we used to talk
about getting away from it all?

33:57.398 --> 34:01.391
Just you and me
on some remote island.

34:05.039 --> 34:06.597
Buddy hated the beach.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.244
Mason knows his stuff.
Restricted airspace.

34:12.413 --> 34:14.176
No surveillance.
It's a virtual blind spot.

34:14.348 --> 34:16.407
He's sure to have
heavy-duty muscle backing him up.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.074
He'll want to verify the codes work.

34:18.252 --> 34:20.413
Which means the missiles
will be someplace close.

34:20.621 --> 34:23.886
Nobody makes a move
until we've confirmed he's got them.

34:24.859 --> 34:25.882
We good?

34:33.734 --> 34:35.395
Let's go, Tracy.

34:46.847 --> 34:49.975
- How are we looking, Sam?
- A lot of blind spots.

34:50.851 --> 34:53.786
I'm gonna have to reposition
to get a line of sight.

34:57.425 --> 34:59.950
Kensi, Deeks, see if you can get
a bead on the Spike missiles.

35:00.161 --> 35:01.389
Roger that.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.730
Heads up, we have company.

35:37.331 --> 35:39.128
Expecting trouble?

35:40.001 --> 35:41.798
You're the one
who brought the backup.

35:42.003 --> 35:44.301
Yeah, well, you never know
who you can trust these days.

35:44.839 --> 35:48.206
Still, it never ceases to amaze me
that when meeting an arms dealer,

35:48.409 --> 35:51.503
people invariably bring arms.

35:53.047 --> 35:55.208
James Thomas Mason.

35:55.416 --> 35:56.474
Agent White not joining?

35:56.684 --> 35:58.652
He's tying up a few loose ends
at the Bureau.

35:59.453 --> 36:00.715
We have the SIM cards.

36:00.955 --> 36:03.651
Down to business. I like that.

36:04.225 --> 36:05.852
May I?

36:12.633 --> 36:16.364
I'd like to, uh, kick the tires,
so to speak, if you don't mind.

36:18.039 --> 36:19.973
Be my guest.

36:23.144 --> 36:24.702
Cheers.

36:33.721 --> 36:35.211
The money transfer?

36:35.389 --> 36:36.413
Easy.

36:36.590 --> 36:39.252
A bunch of blinking lights
doesn't mean this thing actually works.

36:39.493 --> 36:41.461
Give me a minute to find out.

36:51.372 --> 36:53.966
- Nice coveralls.
- Psst.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.712
Yo, Johnny.

37:08.355 --> 37:11.449
I'm here to show you this card trick
that Charlie just showed me.

37:11.625 --> 37:13.252
- No Johnny here.
- He's supposed to be.

37:13.427 --> 37:15.418
Anyway, I'll show you how.
It's amazing.

37:18.899 --> 37:20.059
Federal agent.

37:20.234 --> 37:21.531
Shut it down.

37:21.702 --> 37:24.398
Shut it down.
Put your hands behind your head.

37:24.605 --> 37:26.095
Sam, we've got the missiles.

37:26.273 --> 37:28.264
Okay, Kensi, stand by.

37:28.509 --> 37:30.443
I wanna give this a real test.

37:45.159 --> 37:46.387
Sam, what's going on?

37:46.560 --> 37:47.822
I'm okay, hold your position.

37:52.066 --> 37:53.533
Did you see that?

37:53.734 --> 37:55.929
The container on either side
are barely charred.

37:56.103 --> 37:58.401
- The target's vaporized.
- You happy?

37:59.440 --> 38:01.135
Or would you like to do
another test?

38:01.342 --> 38:03.435
Quite happy.

38:06.680 --> 38:12.243
I do hope Agent White
is able to tie up his loose ends.

38:12.419 --> 38:13.579
There you go.

38:14.155 --> 38:17.352
Money transferred
to the agreed account.

38:20.661 --> 38:22.288
Pleasure doing business with you.

38:23.063 --> 38:24.758
Likewise.

38:27.201 --> 38:28.930
You two make a cute couple.

38:35.276 --> 38:38.109
Let's just try one more, shall we?

38:48.656 --> 38:50.817
We switched out the SIM card
for fake ones.

38:51.025 --> 38:52.117
Oh, dear.

38:52.493 --> 38:54.120
There seems to be a malfunction.

38:54.528 --> 38:56.018
I'm disappointed.

38:58.799 --> 39:00.027
Federal agent.

39:06.807 --> 39:07.899
Let's go.

39:23.157 --> 39:24.624
Federal agents. Stop the car.

39:37.004 --> 39:38.232
Tires or driver?

39:38.439 --> 39:39.906
Tires.

39:49.416 --> 39:51.509
Out of the car.

39:54.455 --> 39:56.150
Put your hands behind your back.

39:58.092 --> 39:59.252
So, what happens now?

39:59.793 --> 40:01.761
We try and recover the money.

40:01.962 --> 40:04.294
Offshore account,
good luck with that.

40:06.567 --> 40:08.694
You have to let me walk away.

40:09.470 --> 40:10.960
You know I can't do that.

40:11.472 --> 40:13.133
Come on, you got the missiles.

40:13.307 --> 40:15.070
I got closure.

40:15.242 --> 40:16.573
Not a bad settlement.

40:19.046 --> 40:21.913
I let you walk out of my life once.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.210
You owe me.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.199
I can't wait to hear Hetty's debriefing
on this one.

41:19.273 --> 41:22.834
Never vacationed in the Caymans.
Always working.

41:25.045 --> 41:26.239
Working now?

41:28.782 --> 41:30.511
Afraid so.

41:35.122 --> 41:36.646
How?

41:37.458 --> 41:38.618
White's cell phone.

41:38.826 --> 41:40.817
The one you took off his body.

41:41.762 --> 41:43.127
We dusted it for prints.

41:43.297 --> 41:45.026
White's weren't on them,
yours were.

41:45.265 --> 41:46.994
You switched them.

41:47.534 --> 41:50.128
We've been tracking you
since you left the scene.

41:50.304 --> 41:52.465
Just needed enough time
for you to clear the cash.

41:56.844 --> 41:58.402
You know,

42:00.681 --> 42:03.081
I never did apologize
for what happened.

42:03.283 --> 42:04.978
Forget about it.

42:05.652 --> 42:08.485
When we tripped that alarm
and you offered to hold the guards off,

42:08.655 --> 42:11.021
- I thought we were on the same page.
- So did I.

42:11.658 --> 42:15.526
Why do you think I searched for you?
I went in worried you were dead.

42:17.931 --> 42:22.891
Imagine my surprise to find you
at the safe house, sipping tea.

42:23.103 --> 42:25.503
We knew that mission
was bigger than either one of us.

42:26.006 --> 42:27.940
Not for me, it wasn't.

42:28.509 --> 42:30.170
I never would have left you.

42:30.377 --> 42:33.744
- It was the only way.
- No, there's always another way.

42:34.748 --> 42:37.342
I guess that's the difference
between you and me.

42:42.623 --> 42:44.250
You know,

42:45.859 --> 42:47.417
we could start over.

42:50.264 --> 42:53.859
- My real name is...
- Rosetti.

42:56.837 --> 42:57.895
Nice boat.

43:01.742 --> 43:03.073
Didn't think I'd keep my partner

43:03.243 --> 43:05.734
from a free trip to the Cayman Islands,
did you?
