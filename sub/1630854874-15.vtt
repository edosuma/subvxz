[APPLAUSE]

00:34.971 --> 00:35.670
>> John: WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK

00:35.739 --> 00:36.637
TONIGHT."

00:36.706 --> 00:37.271
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:37.340 --> 00:38.072
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.141 --> 00:39.607
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:39.676 --> 00:40.508
ISRAEL'S WAR WITH HAMAS

00:40.577 --> 00:41.509
CONTINUED, WITH HUNDREDS OF

00:41.578 --> 00:42.143
HOSTAGES STILL

00:42.212 --> 00:43.144
UNACCOUNTED FOR, WHILE THE

00:43.213 --> 00:44.812
COUNTRY CONTINUES ITS RELENTLESS

00:44.881 --> 00:46.247
BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN GAZA.

00:46.316 --> 00:47.849
MEANWHILE, IN WASHINGTON,

00:47.918 --> 00:49.484
REPUBLICANS FINALLY CHOSE A

00:49.553 --> 00:51.285
NEW HOUSE SPEAKER, MIKE JOHNSON,

00:51.354 --> 00:52.553
A MAN WITH RESTING

00:52.622 --> 00:54.589
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL FACE.

00:54.658 --> 00:56.190
VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT

00:56.259 --> 00:57.992
JOHNSON BEFORE THIS WEEK --

00:58.061 --> 00:59.460
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS EVEN SAID,

00:59.529 --> 01:00.795
"I WAS GOING TO GOOGLE HIM THIS

01:00.864 --> 01:02.063
MORNING."

01:02.132 --> 01:03.297
BUT WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY STARTED

01:03.366 --> 01:04.499
DOING THAT, THE RESULTS WEREN'T

01:04.568 --> 01:05.666
GREAT.

01:05.735 --> 01:07.468
>> BEFORE ENTERING OFFICE,

01:07.537 --> 01:08.603
JOHNSON CALLED ABORTION "A

01:08.672 --> 01:09.971
HOLOCAUST" THAT

01:10.040 --> 01:11.439
HAS BEEN REPEATED EVERY DAY FOR

01:11.508 --> 01:13.207
32 YEARS, SINCE 1973'S

01:13.276 --> 01:14.308
ROE VERSUS WADE.

01:14.377 --> 01:15.843
AS A CONGRESSMAN, HE'S

01:15.912 --> 01:17.645
CO-SPONSORED AT LEAST THREE

01:17.714 --> 01:18.846
BILLS THAT WOULD BAN THE

01:18.915 --> 01:20.615
PROCEDURE NATIONWIDE.

01:20.684 --> 01:21.516
JOHNSON IS ALSO STAUNCHLY

01:21.585 --> 01:23.284
ANTI-GAY RIGHT.

01:23.353 --> 01:24.852
IN 2004, HE CALLED HOMOSEXUALITY

01:24.921 --> 01:26.554
"INHERENTLY UNNATURAL" AND VOTED

01:26.623 --> 01:28.322
AGAINST LEGALIZING SAME-SEX

01:28.391 --> 01:30.758
MARRIAGE.

01:30.827 --> 01:32.226
>> John: WOW.

01:32.295 --> 01:33.361
ALTHOUGH, LET'S FACE IT, IT'S

01:33.430 --> 01:34.495
NOT LIKE THE NEW REPUBLICAN

01:34.564 --> 01:35.296
SPEAKER "WASN'T" GOING

01:35.365 --> 01:36.030
TO HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF

01:36.099 --> 01:37.431
HORRIFYING OPINIONS.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.866
IT'D BE "MORE" SURPRISING IF HE

01:38.935 --> 01:40.067
THREW A COUPLE OF GOOD ONES IN

01:40.136 --> 01:41.235
THERE, TOO.

01:41.304 --> 01:42.937
"HE BELIEVES ABORTION IS A

01:43.006 --> 01:44.472
HOLOCAUST, THAT FRIDAY SHOULD BE

01:44.541 --> 01:45.273
PART OF THE WEEKEND, GAY

01:45.342 --> 01:46.374
MARRIAGE IS INHERENTLY

01:46.443 --> 01:47.708
UNNATURAL, WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN

01:47.777 --> 01:49.377
STEM AND THERE SHOULD BE PARKS

01:49.446 --> 01:50.778
WHERE ADULTS CAN RIDE DOWN THE

01:50.847 --> 01:52.079
GIANT INFLATABLE SLIDE

01:52.148 --> 01:54.348
THEY USE WHEN PLANES CRASH."

01:54.417 --> 01:55.983
AND I'M SURE THERE'LL BE MORE TO

01:56.052 --> 01:58.052
SAY ABOUT JOHNSON GOING FORWARD,

01:58.121 --> 01:58.686
BUT FOR NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TURN

01:58.755 --> 01:59.987
TO ARGENTINA.

02:00.056 --> 02:02.190
BIRTHPLACE OF BOTH THE POPE, AND

02:02.259 --> 02:04.759
THE ACTUAL GOD.

02:04.828 --> 02:06.561
ARGENTINA IS SUFFERING A SEVERE

02:06.630 --> 02:07.995
ECONOMIC CRISIS -- WITH

02:08.064 --> 02:09.030
INFLATION RUNNING CLOSE TO 140

02:09.099 --> 02:10.698
PERCENT.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.333
IT HELD ITS PRESIDENTIAL

02:12.402 --> 02:13.267
ELECTION LAST SUNDAY, AND AS NO

02:13.336 --> 02:14.702
CANDIDATE WON

02:14.771 --> 02:16.170
OUTRIGHT, THERE'LL NOW BE A

02:16.239 --> 02:17.238
RUNOFF BETWEEN THE TOP TWO

02:17.307 --> 02:17.939
CANDIDATES.

02:18.008 --> 02:18.706
ONE IS THE CENTER-LEFT FINANCE

02:18.775 --> 02:19.540
MINISTER

02:19.609 --> 02:20.508
WHOSE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WIDELY

02:20.577 --> 02:21.576
BLAMED FOR THE CURRENT FINANCIAL

02:21.645 --> 02:22.944
CRISIS.

02:23.013 --> 02:24.946
AND THE OTHER, JAVIER MILEI --

02:25.015 --> 02:28.850
WHO, YES, DOES LOOK LIKE THIS

02:28.919 --> 02:29.851
-- WELL, I'LL LET INTRODUCE

02:29.920 --> 02:32.220
HIMSELF.

02:32.289 --> 02:33.054
>> "HI!

02:33.123 --> 02:34.355
I AM GENERAL ANCAP.

02:34.424 --> 02:35.756
I COME FROM LIBERLAND."

02:35.825 --> 02:37.125
"MY MISSION IS TO KICK THE

02:37.194 --> 02:38.192
EVER-LOVING SHIT OUT OF

02:38.261 --> 02:38.893
KEYNESIAN AND COLLECTIVIST

02:38.962 --> 02:40.061
FUCKERS TRYING TO RUIN

02:40.130 --> 02:41.395
OUR LIVES."

02:41.464 --> 02:42.697
>> John: YEAH, JUST A CLASSIC,

02:42.766 --> 02:43.531
RUN-OF-THE-MILL

02:43.600 --> 02:44.732
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, DRESSED

02:44.801 --> 02:45.766
LIKE MR. PEANUT DRESSED AS A

02:45.835 --> 02:47.468
WIZARD DRESSED AS

02:47.537 --> 02:49.337
BATMAN, PLEDGING TO KICK THE

02:49.406 --> 02:50.338
SHIT OUT OF "KEYNESIANS."

02:50.407 --> 02:52.440
IF I HAD ONE NOTE FOR THAT

02:52.509 --> 02:53.341
SUPERHERO, IT'S

02:53.410 --> 02:54.509
THAT JOHN MAYNARD KANES PROBABLY

02:54.578 --> 02:55.610
ISN'T THE MOST COMPELLING

02:55.679 --> 02:56.711
SUPER-NEMESIS.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.812
FEW ECONOMISTS ARE.

02:57.881 --> 02:59.514
THERE'S A REASON THE AVENGERS

02:59.583 --> 03:00.248
FOUGHT THANOS AND NOT ALAN

03:00.317 --> 03:01.949
GREENSPAN.

03:02.018 --> 03:04.051
BUT MILEI IS A LOT.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.386
"CAPTAIN ANCAP" IS PRESUMABLY A

03:05.455 --> 03:06.554
REFERENCE TO HIS POLITICAL

03:06.623 --> 03:07.955
PHILOSOPHY OF

03:08.024 --> 03:09.791
ANARCHO-CAPITALISM -- "A STRAND

03:09.860 --> 03:10.558
OF LIBERTARIANISM THAT SEEKS TO

03:10.627 --> 03:11.826
ABOLISH THE STATE IN FAVOR OF

03:11.895 --> 03:12.627
UNFETTERED

03:12.696 --> 03:13.995
FREE MARKETS."

03:14.064 --> 03:15.596
AND HE CAMPAIGNED ON HEAVY CUTS,

03:15.665 --> 03:17.098
SUGGESTING SLASHING PUBLIC

03:17.167 --> 03:18.900
SPENDING BY 15% OF GDP

03:18.969 --> 03:20.968
AND ELIMINATING MOST TAXES.

03:21.037 --> 03:22.537
HE ALSO HAS A CONTROVERSIAL PLAN

03:22.606 --> 03:24.038
TO SWAP THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY

03:24.107 --> 03:25.740
FOR THE US

03:25.809 --> 03:27.842
DOLLAR, HAS SAID HE WANTS TO

03:27.911 --> 03:29.710
"BLOW UP" THE CENTRAL BANK, AND

03:29.779 --> 03:31.712
HAS EVEN SMASHED MODELS OF IT IN

03:31.781 --> 03:33.347
CAMPAIGN VIDEOS AND ALSO IN

03:33.416 --> 03:35.450
PINATA FORM IN TV

03:35.519 --> 03:36.317
APPEARANCES.

03:36.386 --> 03:37.585
HE'S ALSO SYMBOLIZED HIS DESIRE

03:37.654 --> 03:40.788
TO SLASH THE GOVERNMENT BY

03:40.857 --> 03:41.689
WAVING CHAINSAWS AROUND, AN

03:41.758 --> 03:42.890
IMAGE HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE RUN

03:42.959 --> 03:45.626
WITH, WEARING CHAINSAW MASKS TO

03:45.695 --> 03:46.194
VOTE FOR HIM, AND EVEN WHILE

03:46.263 --> 03:47.562
DOING INTERVIEWS.

03:47.631 --> 03:49.130
>> THE FIGHT CONTINUES FOR

03:49.199 --> 03:50.431
JAVIER MILEI, FAR-RIGHT POPULIST

03:50.500 --> 03:51.566
WHO WANTS TO SEE SPENDING

03:51.635 --> 03:53.334
SLASHED.

03:53.403 --> 03:54.435
THE CHAINSAW HAS BECOME A SYMBOL

03:54.504 --> 03:57.071
OF THIS PLEDGE.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.440
>> MILEI IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

03:59.509 --> 04:00.741
THAT HASN'T BEEN TESTED BEFORE.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.610
>> John: OKAY!

04:02.679 --> 04:04.612
NOT TO BREAK MY ONE RULE AND

04:04.681 --> 04:06.948
ARGUE WITH A GUY DRESSED AS A

04:07.017 --> 04:08.249
CHAINSAW, BUT, LOTS OF IDEAS

04:08.318 --> 04:10.218
HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED BEFORE.

04:10.287 --> 04:11.853
WE ALSO HAVEN'T TRIED

04:11.922 --> 04:14.555
ALL-TRAMPOLINE RETIREMENT HOMES,

04:14.624 --> 04:15.490
OR LETTING RACOONS BE CHIEF OF

04:15.559 --> 04:16.657
SURGERY.

04:16.726 --> 04:19.393
THAT'S BECAUSE SOME IDEAS ARE

04:19.462 --> 04:20.862
JUST BAD, AND I'D ARGUE MAYBE

04:20.931 --> 04:21.963
GIVING CONTROL OF

04:22.032 --> 04:23.831
THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN

04:23.900 --> 04:24.932
LATIN AMERICA TO A GUY WHO LOOKS

04:25.001 --> 04:26.234
LIKE HE WAS ESCORTED

04:26.303 --> 04:27.802
OUT OF A COMIC-CON PANEL FOR

04:27.871 --> 04:29.270
ASKING SCARLET JOHANNSON TOO

04:29.339 --> 04:30.338
MANY QUESTIONS

04:30.407 --> 04:33.441
MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.

04:33.510 --> 04:34.075
AND IT'S NOT JUST HIS COSTUMES

04:34.144 --> 04:34.942
AND PROPS THAT ARE COLORFUL --

04:35.011 --> 04:36.244
TAKE THIS TALK-SHOW

04:36.313 --> 04:37.311
INTERVIEW, WHERE HE GOES INTO

04:37.380 --> 04:38.546
MORE DETAIL ABOUT HIS SEX LIFE

04:38.615 --> 04:39.347
THAN YOU ARE

04:39.416 --> 04:42.183
POSSIBLY EXPECTING.

04:42.252 --> 04:43.785
>> IN TANTRA, LESS THAN 45

04:43.854 --> 04:45.553
MINUTES IS CONSIDERED PREMATURE

04:45.622 --> 04:46.687
EJACULATION.

04:46.756 --> 04:48.556
>> LESS THAN HOW MUCH?

04:48.625 --> 04:50.858
>> 45 MINUTES.

04:50.927 --> 04:53.728
EACH MAN HAS HIS OWN DYNAMIC.

04:53.797 --> 04:55.596
IN MY PARTICULAR CASE, I

04:55.665 --> 04:56.898
EJACULATE ONCE EVERY THREE

04:56.967 --> 05:00.735
MONTHS.

05:00.804 --> 05:05.373
>> THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:05.442 --> 05:08.643
>> John: IS IT INCREDIBLE?

05:08.712 --> 05:10.378
I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY

05:10.447 --> 05:11.913
BE EXTREMELY CREDIBLE.

05:11.982 --> 05:14.015
BECAUSE I COMPLETELY BELIEVE

05:14.084 --> 05:15.883
THAT THE GUY WE SAW SCREAMING AT

05:15.952 --> 05:17.685
DEAD ECONOMISTS, SMASHING

05:17.754 --> 05:19.620
MINIATURE BANKS ON TV, AND

05:19.689 --> 05:20.688
WAVING A CHAINSAW IN THE STREETS

05:20.757 --> 05:21.289
MAY BE A LITTLE, AND I'M SORRY

05:21.358 --> 05:22.557
FOR SAYING THIS,

05:22.626 --> 05:24.559
BACKED UP.

05:24.628 --> 05:25.793
AND THEN THERE'S MILEI'S

05:25.862 --> 05:26.527
OBSESSION WITH

05:26.596 --> 05:28.563
HIS DOGS.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.096
HE'S CONSTANTLY POSING FOR

05:29.165 --> 05:30.064
PHOTOS WITH

05:30.133 --> 05:31.599
THEM, OR HOLDING UP PORTRAITS

05:31.668 --> 05:33.167
GIFTED BY HIS SUPPORTERS.

05:33.236 --> 05:34.235
JUST WATCH AS THIS INTERVIEW ON

05:34.304 --> 05:35.603
A TALK SHOW GETS TOTALLY

05:35.672 --> 05:37.071
DERAILED WHEN HE SEES A PHOTO OF

05:37.140 --> 05:38.339
HIS DOG CONAN.

05:38.408 --> 05:39.707
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S

05:39.776 --> 05:40.308
BEING SAID HERE -- I PROMISE,

05:40.377 --> 05:40.808
YOU'LL PICK UP

05:40.877 --> 05:47.877
THE GIST OF IT.

05:53.356 --> 06:00.356
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

06:07.337 --> 06:09.137
>> John: THAT IS PRETTY

06:09.206 --> 06:09.704
LIKABLE.

06:09.773 --> 06:11.506
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO CRITICIZE

06:11.575 --> 06:12.740
THAT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW I

06:12.809 --> 06:16.244
RESPOND IF I EVER SEE A PICTURE

06:16.313 --> 06:18.546
OF CONAN.

06:18.615 --> 06:19.547
IT'S CONAN!

06:19.616 --> 06:20.848
THE POINT IS, WE ALL LOVE THINGS

06:20.917 --> 06:21.883
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

06:21.952 --> 06:22.683
COMPLETELY DISTRACT US,

06:22.752 --> 06:27.955
WHENEVER THEY --

06:28.024 --> 06:30.424
IT'S CONAN.

06:30.493 --> 06:35.096
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT HE

06:35.165 --> 06:36.531
FAILS TO PAY ATTENTION.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.533
>> QUIT STARING AT ME, JOHN!

06:38.602 --> 06:40.501
I'M NOT A PIECE OF MEAT!

06:40.570 --> 06:41.102
>> John: NO, OF COURSE YOU'RE

06:41.171 --> 06:41.269
NOT.

06:41.338 --> 06:41.669
I'M SORRY, CONAN.

06:41.738 --> 06:45.807
I TRULY APOLOGIZE.

06:45.876 --> 06:46.641
ANYWAY, LIKE I SAID: THE THINGS

06:46.710 --> 06:49.410
WE LOVE CAN BE DISTRACTING.

06:49.479 --> 06:50.344
SO IT'S CLEAR: MILEI LOVES HIS

06:50.413 --> 06:53.347
DOGS.

06:53.416 --> 06:54.549
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW: WHILE I'VE

06:54.618 --> 06:55.883
BEEN SAYING "DOGS," I REALLY

06:55.952 --> 06:56.484
SHOULD HAVE JUST

06:56.553 --> 06:57.318
SAID "DOG," BECAUSE ALL OF THEM

06:57.387 --> 06:57.919
ARE GENETIC COPIES OF HIS ONE

06:57.988 --> 07:00.221
FORMER DOG, CONAN.

07:00.290 --> 07:04.592
AND THE STORY GETS EVEN WEIRDER.

07:04.661 --> 07:05.226
BECAUSE CALLS HIS CLONED DOGS --

07:05.295 --> 07:06.060
OF WHICH THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR

07:06.129 --> 07:06.727
"THE BEST STRATEGISTS IN THE

07:06.796 --> 07:07.562
WORLD", AND

07:07.631 --> 07:08.896
ACCORDING TO ONE BIOGRAPHER,

07:08.965 --> 07:12.633
TRUSTS THEM TO A GENUINE FAULT.

07:12.702 --> 07:14.602
>> THE DOGS HE HAS NOW

07:14.671 --> 07:15.736
ARE DIVIDED INTO A SORT OF

07:15.805 --> 07:17.238
CABINET.

07:17.307 --> 07:18.406
HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT CONAN, THE

07:18.475 --> 07:20.108
DOG THAT DIED, HAS REINCARNATED

07:20.177 --> 07:21.509
IN ONE OF THE CLONES.

07:21.578 --> 07:22.610
THAT DOG HELPS

07:22.679 --> 07:23.478
HIM, AND I QUOTE, "WITH THE

07:23.547 --> 07:25.246
GENERAL STRATEGY."

07:25.315 --> 07:27.949
THEN MURRAY ADVISES HIM

07:28.018 --> 07:28.683
IN ECONOMICS, AND LUCAS IS THE

07:28.752 --> 07:29.517
ONE THAT HELPS HIM SEE THE

07:29.586 --> 07:29.984
FUTURE AND

07:30.053 --> 07:31.319
LEARN FROM HIS MISTAKES.

07:31.388 --> 07:32.386
IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN OFFICIAL

07:32.455 --> 07:33.521
CABINET.

07:33.590 --> 07:34.956
>> John: OKAY.

07:35.025 --> 07:35.590
AT THIS POINT I FEEL THE NEED TO

07:35.659 --> 07:36.491
TELL YOU.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.225
WE DIDN'T INVENT THIS MAN FOR

07:37.294 --> 07:39.827
THIS SHOW.

07:39.896 --> 07:41.262
I GET HOW AN

07:41.331 --> 07:42.230
"ANARCHO-CAPITALIST,

07:42.299 --> 07:42.697
CHAINSAW-BRANDISHING,

07:42.766 --> 07:44.031
DOG-CLONING PRESIDENTIAL

07:44.100 --> 07:45.466
CANDIDATE WHO LOOKS LIKE A

07:45.535 --> 07:47.335
WATERLOGGED BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG

07:47.404 --> 07:49.036
AND SEES HIS DOGS AS SOME SORT

07:49.105 --> 07:50.271
OF CLAIRVOYANT, REINCARNATED

07:50.340 --> 07:51.639
FORCE FUNCTIONING AS A POLITICAL

07:51.708 --> 07:52.774
CABINET" --

07:52.843 --> 07:54.041
COULD SEEM LIKE HE WAS

07:54.110 --> 07:55.409
TAILOR-MADE, IN A

07:55.478 --> 07:56.978
LAB, SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS SHOW.

07:57.047 --> 07:57.945
BUT HE WASN'T.

07:58.014 --> 08:00.414
HIS DOGS WERE, BUT HE WASN'T.

08:00.483 --> 08:01.949
THIS IS A DISTRESSINGLY REAL

08:02.018 --> 08:03.284
PERSON.

08:03.353 --> 08:04.552
AND WHILE THERE IS SOMETHING

08:04.621 --> 08:05.586
VERY FUNNY

08:05.655 --> 08:07.421
ABOUT A POLITICIAN WHO WORKSHOPS

08:07.490 --> 08:09.357
HIS IDEAS WITH HIS FOUR DOG, IT

08:09.426 --> 08:10.358
GETS LESS FUN

08:10.427 --> 08:11.092
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THOSE IDEAS

08:11.161 --> 08:12.026
ARE.

08:12.095 --> 08:12.794
BECAUSE HE'S CALLED FOR

08:12.863 --> 08:14.796
EXPANDING GUN OWNERSHIP AND

08:14.865 --> 08:16.164
OUTLAWING ABORTION, REFERRED TO

08:16.233 --> 08:17.532
GLOBAL WARMING AS A "SOCIALIST

08:17.601 --> 08:18.833
LIE", HAS CALLED TRUMP

08:18.902 --> 08:19.634
ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS IN

08:19.703 --> 08:20.635
THE HISTORY

08:20.704 --> 08:21.602
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND

08:21.671 --> 08:22.437
DESCRIBED THE

08:22.506 --> 08:23.337
POPE AS AN "EMBARRASSING

08:23.406 --> 08:24.772
COMMUNIST," A "PIECE OF SHIT,"

08:24.841 --> 08:26.874
AND A "POTATO."

08:26.943 --> 08:28.209
AND LOOK I KNOW WE WEREN'T

08:28.278 --> 08:29.710
EXPECTING

08:29.779 --> 08:31.078
THE MAN WITH A BUNCH OF CLONED

08:31.147 --> 08:32.113
DOGS AND A ONCE-PER-QUARTER JIZZ

08:32.182 --> 08:32.413
SCHEDULE TO

08:32.482 --> 08:33.915
HAVE "GOOD" OPINIONS.

08:33.984 --> 08:35.650
BUT THOSE ARE STRIKINGLY BAD.

08:35.719 --> 08:36.751
AND MILEI HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.453
PARTICULARLY FROM YOUNG MEN.

08:38.522 --> 08:39.954
AND THE THING IS, A DESIRE FOR

08:40.023 --> 08:42.023
SOME SORT OF RADICAL CHANGE IS

08:42.092 --> 08:43.257
UNDERSTANDABLE,

08:43.326 --> 08:44.826
GIVEN THE DEPTHS OF ARGENTINA'S

08:44.895 --> 08:45.927
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

08:45.996 --> 08:48.763
PEOPLE'S EARNINGS AND SAVINGS

08:48.832 --> 08:49.764
HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT, AND AROUND

08:49.833 --> 08:50.431
40 PERCENT OF ARGENTINES ARE

08:50.500 --> 08:52.934
LIVING IN POVERTY.

08:53.003 --> 08:54.368
THINGS ARE REALLY BAD THERE.

08:54.437 --> 08:55.636
AND REMEMBER: MILEI'S OPPONENT

08:55.705 --> 08:56.871
IS THE CURRENT FINANCE

08:56.940 --> 08:57.939
MINISTER, SO HE'S TIED PRETTY

08:58.008 --> 08:59.774
CLOSELY TO IT.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.509
IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT SOME

09:01.578 --> 09:02.810
ARGENTINES -- LIKE THIS WOMAN

09:02.879 --> 09:03.911
VOTING LAST SUNDAY -- ARE PRETTY

09:03.980 --> 09:04.846
DEPRESSED ABOUT THE OPTIONS IN

09:04.915 --> 09:07.982
FRONT OF THEM.

09:08.051 --> 09:08.516
>> WE DON'T HAVE A

09:08.585 --> 09:10.952
REALLY GOOD OPTION.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.320
I DIDN'T CAME

09:12.389 --> 09:12.987
HERE AND SAID I KNOW WHO I'M

09:13.056 --> 09:14.522
GOING TO VOTE.

09:14.591 --> 09:17.291
I WAS LIKE I DON'T REALLY

09:17.360 --> 09:19.160
KNOW BECAUSE NOTHING -- NOTHING

09:19.229 --> 09:19.894
IS AND I BELIEVE THAT NOTHING IS

09:19.963 --> 09:22.029
GOOD.

09:22.098 --> 09:23.498
>> John: YEAH, WHEN YOUR OPTIONS

09:23.567 --> 09:25.199
ARE MORE OF THE SAME OR EMO

09:25.268 --> 09:27.335
EDGELORD TUCKER CARLSON

09:27.404 --> 09:28.703
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE TO BELIEVE

09:28.772 --> 09:29.704
THAT NOTHING IS GOOD.

09:29.773 --> 09:31.739
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE WORSE

09:31.808 --> 09:33.107
THINGS GET, THE EASIER IT IS FOR

09:33.176 --> 09:34.408
MILEI TO MAKE THE CASE THAT ANY

09:34.477 --> 09:35.476
CHANGE --

09:35.545 --> 09:36.277
NO MATTER HOW UNTESTED OR

09:36.346 --> 09:36.944
DANGEROUS --

09:37.013 --> 09:37.779
IS BETTER THAN THE CURRENT

09:37.848 --> 09:39.514
SYSTEM.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.581
SO WHILE I AGREE ARGENTINES

09:40.650 --> 09:42.350
DESERVE SOMETHING NEW, I ALSO

09:42.419 --> 09:43.684
THINK THEY DESERVE

09:43.753 --> 09:45.853
A LOT BETTER THAN THIS

09:45.922 --> 09:46.821
CHAINSAW-WIELDING, BACKED-UP

09:46.890 --> 09:49.791
SUPERHERO AND HIS XEROXED DOG

09:49.860 --> 09:50.024
QUARTET.

09:50.093 --> 09:55.163
AND NOW THIS.

09:55.232 --> 09:57.598
>> Interpreter: AND NOW SHE

09:57.667 --> 10:01.369
SEEMS LIKE SHE IS A FUN KID.

10:01.438 --> 10:02.937
>> I WAS A GIRL SCOUT.

10:03.006 --> 10:06.274
I WAS KICKED OUT AND GIRL SCOUT.

10:06.343 --> 10:06.674
I WAS VERY VOCAL.

10:06.743 --> 10:08.242
I WOULD SHARE MY STORIES ABOUT

10:08.311 --> 10:08.843
BEING IN A GIRL SCOUT IF I HAD

10:08.912 --> 10:10.478
NOT BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE

10:10.547 --> 10:11.612
GIRL SCOUT.

10:11.681 --> 10:13.014
I WAS KICKED OUT THE GIRL SCOUT

10:13.083 --> 10:18.486
FOR BEING TOO MOUTHY.

10:18.555 --> 10:20.288
I GOT KICKED OUT OF THE

10:20.357 --> 10:20.588
GIRL SCOUTS.

10:20.657 --> 10:22.690
EDIT I DID NOT THINK IT WAS ALL

10:22.759 --> 10:23.658
THAT COOL AND MAYBE GO TO A

10:23.727 --> 10:25.126
JIMMY CARTER SPEECH WHEN HE WAS

10:25.195 --> 10:25.393
PRESIDENT.

10:25.462 --> 10:32.462
I BITCHED ABOUT IT.

10:33.537 --> 10:35.403
I WAS VERY VOCAL ABOUT THAT.

10:35.472 --> 10:37.572
I GOT KICKED OUT OF THE

10:37.641 --> 10:38.339
GIRL SCOUTS BECAUSE I FUSSED

10:38.408 --> 10:40.341
ABOUT THEM MAKING ME GO TO THAT

10:40.410 --> 10:41.342
JIMMY CARTER SPEECH WHEN HE WAS

10:41.411 --> 10:42.477
THE PRESIDENT.

10:42.546 --> 10:47.482
JUST A QUICK CONFESSION.

10:47.551 --> 10:49.117
THE THING ABOUT SLEEPING LIKE

10:49.186 --> 10:50.651
THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF

10:50.720 --> 10:52.320
VAMPIRES BITING YOUR NECK, I

10:52.389 --> 10:52.687
STILL DO THAT.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.755
♪ ♪

10:54.824 --> 10:56.157
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:56.226 --> 10:57.258
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:57.327 --> 10:59.527
CHOCOLATE.

10:59.596 --> 11:00.661
THE STAR ATTRACTION IN

11:00.730 --> 11:02.296
NEOPOLITAN ICE CREAM.

11:02.365 --> 11:03.464
NOTHING AGAINST VANILLA AND

11:03.533 --> 11:04.799
STRAWBERRY, IT'S JUST THAT ONE

11:04.868 --> 11:05.399
IS A EUPHEMISM FOR BORING SEX,

11:05.468 --> 11:06.300
AND THE OTHER IS FRUIT, AND

11:06.369 --> 11:10.471
FRUIT IS SIMPLY NOT DESSERT.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.507
CHOCOLATE IS THE GREATEST --

11:12.576 --> 11:13.841
JUST WATCH AS THIS BABY GETS A

11:13.910 --> 11:20.910
FIRST TASTE OF IT.

11:23.687 --> 11:30.687
>> ARE YOU READY?

11:31.928 --> 11:32.994
>> YEAH, BABY!

11:33.063 --> 11:33.694
SAME!

11:33.763 --> 11:34.228
AND I HOPE IT SAVORS THAT

11:34.297 --> 11:35.196
CHOCOLATE HIGH.

11:35.265 --> 11:37.498
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL KNOW --

11:37.567 --> 11:37.799
THE REST OF

11:37.868 --> 11:38.432
HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH

11:38.501 --> 11:38.866
DOWNHILL FROM THERE.

11:38.935 --> 11:39.634
EVERYONE LOVES CHOCOLATE --

11:39.703 --> 11:41.068
THAT'S WHY

11:41.137 --> 11:41.836
WE USE IT FOR EVERYTHING -- FROM

11:41.905 --> 11:42.637
BEAUTY PRODUCTS, TO SCULPTURES,

11:42.706 --> 11:44.338
TO BREAKFAST CEREAL.

11:44.407 --> 11:46.774
ALTHOUGH SOME ARGUABLY LOVE IT A

11:46.843 --> 11:47.608
LITTLE TOO MUCH, LIKE THE HOST

11:47.677 --> 11:49.143
OF THIS COOKING SHOW.

11:49.212 --> 11:50.945
>> THERE'S A COMPONENT, A

11:51.014 --> 11:51.946
SUBSTANCE IN

11:52.015 --> 11:53.714
CHOCOLATE CALLED

11:53.783 --> 11:56.350
"PHENYLETHYLAMINE" AND WHAT THAT

11:56.419 --> 11:57.318
FANCY WORD DOES IS IT SLIGHTLY

11:57.387 --> 12:00.822
ELEVATES YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND

12:00.891 --> 12:02.690
YOUR HEARTRATE, AND THEY TELL ME

12:02.759 --> 12:04.258
THAT ITS A SENSATION THAT'S NOT

12:04.327 --> 12:07.261
UNLIKE HAVING AN ORGASM.

12:07.330 --> 12:10.198
I DON'T KNOW!

12:10.267 --> 12:10.665
MAYBE THATS WHY PEOPLE

12:10.734 --> 12:11.365
LOVE CHOCOLATE SO MUCH, BUT,

12:11.434 --> 12:12.667
ANYWAY, LET ME GET BACK TO OUR

12:12.736 --> 12:15.269
STEP HERE.

12:15.338 --> 12:17.505
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, WHAT A

12:17.574 --> 12:18.973
LONG, WEIRD WAY TO

12:19.042 --> 12:20.741
TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE NEVER

12:20.810 --> 12:22.410
HAD AN ORGASM.

12:22.479 --> 12:23.878
SECOND, I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S

12:23.947 --> 12:24.879
A CHEMICAL

12:24.948 --> 12:25.513
THAT MAKES YOUR BRAIN HORNY AND

12:25.582 --> 12:27.315
THEY NAMED IT

12:27.384 --> 12:28.749
"PHENYLETHYLAMINE."

12:28.818 --> 12:29.250
THAT'S NOT A SEXY

12:29.319 --> 12:29.951
NAME.

12:30.020 --> 12:30.651
"EROTISOL.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.519
SEDUCTILUST.

12:31.588 --> 12:38.588
DAT-ASSOLINE."

12:38.995 --> 12:39.093
ALL

12:39.162 --> 12:39.627
AND JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR;

12:39.696 --> 12:40.294
OF THOSE ARE FREE AND AVAILABLE.

12:40.363 --> 12:41.629
EATING CHOCOLATE IS NOTHING LIKE

12:41.698 --> 12:42.230
HAVING AN ORGASM.

12:42.299 --> 12:43.731
UNLESS YOU COUNT THE FACT THAT

12:43.800 --> 12:44.332
WHEN BOYS DO IT, IT'S MESSIER.

12:44.401 --> 12:45.333
BUT CHOCOLATE ISN'T JUST MAKING

12:45.402 --> 12:46.334
PEOPLE HORNY, IT'S ALSO MAKING A

12:46.403 --> 12:48.035
LOT OF MONEY.

12:48.104 --> 12:49.670
GLOBALLY, IT'S A $140 BILLION

12:49.739 --> 12:51.939
DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY,

12:52.008 --> 12:53.274
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

12:53.343 --> 12:54.275
SITTING AT HOME THINKING, "HOLD

12:54.344 --> 12:55.610
ON -- I'VE SEEN THIS

12:55.679 --> 12:56.911
SHOW BEFORE."

12:56.980 --> 12:57.945
THIS FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE

12:58.014 --> 12:59.147
ONE OF THE FUN STORIES, BUT IS

12:59.216 --> 13:00.381
IT ABOUT TO TAKE A TURN?

13:00.450 --> 13:02.450
I'VE GOT A JUMBO BAG OF FUN-SIZE

13:02.519 --> 13:03.518
SNICKERS I'M GOING TO BE HANDING

13:03.587 --> 13:04.152
OUT TO TINY IRON

13:04.221 --> 13:05.720
MEN, ELSAS AND LUIGIS IN 48

13:05.789 --> 13:06.754
HOURS.

13:06.823 --> 13:07.989
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THAT WEIRD

13:08.058 --> 13:09.490
FOR ME?

13:09.559 --> 13:11.526
YES, I AM.

13:11.595 --> 13:12.860
AND ALSO, DON'T BULLSHIT ME.

13:12.929 --> 13:13.661
HALF THAT BAG'S GONNA BE GONE BY

13:13.730 --> 13:15.663
HALLOWEEN, AND YOU KNOW IT.

13:15.732 --> 13:16.998
BUT THE REASON THIS IS ABOUT TO

13:17.067 --> 13:19.500
TAKE A TURN IS, FOR ALL THE

13:19.569 --> 13:20.234
MONEY AND HAPPINESS

13:20.303 --> 13:21.569
SURROUNDING CHOCOLATE, THERE'S

13:21.638 --> 13:23.671
ONE GROUP THAT DOESN'T GET TO

13:23.740 --> 13:23.971
SHARE IN IT,

13:24.040 --> 13:24.705
AND THAT'S THE FARMERS WHO GROW

13:24.774 --> 13:27.141
COCOA IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.176
THE MAJORITY HAVE NEVER EVEN

13:28.245 --> 13:29.744
TASTED CHOCOLATE.

13:29.813 --> 13:31.279
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

13:31.348 --> 13:33.314
REPORTERS AND DOCUMENTARIANS

13:33.383 --> 13:33.848
LOVE TO TRY AND REMEDY ON

13:33.917 --> 13:35.616
CAMERA, PERHAPS

13:35.685 --> 13:37.685
NONE AS PATRONIZINGLY AS THIS.

13:37.754 --> 13:38.786
>> THESE FARMERS HAVE BEEN

13:38.855 --> 13:40.188
GROWING BEANS FOR DECADES.

13:40.257 --> 13:41.489
THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET THEIR

13:41.558 --> 13:48.396
FIRST TASTE OF CHOCOLATE.

13:48.465 --> 13:48.896
>> YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED

13:48.965 --> 13:49.597
CHOCOLATE?

13:49.666 --> 13:53.901
>> NO.

13:53.970 --> 13:59.340
>> MM!

13:59.409 --> 14:01.442
>> THAT IS YOUR COCOA!

14:01.511 --> 14:03.044
>> John: WELL, TO THOSE WHO

14:03.113 --> 14:03.878
THOUGHT I'M THE

14:03.947 --> 14:04.779
MOST ANNOYING VERSION OF A LOUD

14:04.848 --> 14:05.246
MAN

14:05.315 --> 14:06.047
ON TV WITH A BRITISH ACCENT,

14:06.116 --> 14:07.482
LOOKS LIKE

14:07.551 --> 14:08.883
YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY.

14:08.952 --> 14:09.917
BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY

14:09.986 --> 14:11.686
CONDESCENDING.

14:11.755 --> 14:12.487
"ATTENTION, FORMER SUBJECTS, WE

14:12.556 --> 14:13.321
NOTICED

14:13.390 --> 14:14.222
THAT YOU HAVE NOT ONCE TASTED

14:14.291 --> 14:14.589
THE FRUITS

14:14.658 --> 14:16.290
OF YOUR INTERMINABLE TOIL, SO

14:16.359 --> 14:17.458
ALLOW ME TO PRESENT YOU WITH THE

14:17.527 --> 14:18.292
GENEROUS GIFT OF A SINGLE

14:18.361 --> 14:20.428
KIT-KAT.

14:20.497 --> 14:24.232
THAT IS YOUR COCOA!"

14:24.301 --> 14:25.299
AND THE REASON MOST FARMERS

14:25.368 --> 14:26.267
HAVEN'T TRIED CHOCOLATE BEFORE

14:26.336 --> 14:27.401
IS, THEY CAN'T

14:27.470 --> 14:30.571
AFFORD IT.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.439
MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF COCOA

14:31.508 --> 14:32.673
COMES FROM JUST TWO WEST AFRICAN

14:32.742 --> 14:33.941
COUNTRIES -- IVORY

14:34.010 --> 14:35.076
COAST, AND GHANA.

14:35.145 --> 14:37.211
AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT,

14:37.280 --> 14:38.479
IN THOSE PLACES, BETWEEN 73 AND

14:38.548 --> 14:39.881
90 PERCENT OF COCOA

14:39.950 --> 14:41.649
FARMERS DO NOT EARN A LIVING

14:41.718 --> 14:42.984
INCOME, WITH 30 TO 58 PERCENT

14:43.053 --> 14:43.851
EARNING BELOW THE

14:43.920 --> 14:45.987
WORLD BANK'S EXTREME POVERTY

14:46.056 --> 14:46.187
LINE.

14:46.256 --> 14:47.355
AND THERE IS SOMETHING A BIT

14:47.424 --> 14:48.422
WEIRD ABOUT A PRODUCT SO

14:48.491 --> 14:50.091
SYNONYMOUS FOR SPREADING

14:50.160 --> 14:51.826
JOY, AND GIVING BABIES WHAT'S

14:51.895 --> 14:53.561
BASICALLY A COCAINE RUSH,

14:53.630 --> 14:55.029
ABANDONING THOSE WHO GROW ITS

14:55.098 --> 14:55.730
KEY INGREDIENT TO

14:55.799 --> 14:57.265
GRINDING POVERTY.

14:57.334 --> 14:59.066
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAD A SENSE

14:59.135 --> 15:00.168
THAT COCOA PRODUCTION HAD

15:00.237 --> 15:01.469
ISSUES, THE TRUTH

15:01.538 --> 15:02.837
IS, FROM THE LAND ITS GROWN ON,

15:02.906 --> 15:04.472
TO THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF

15:04.541 --> 15:05.740
THOSE WHO HARVEST IT, IT'S WORSE

15:05.809 --> 15:06.607
THAN YOU MAY

15:06.676 --> 15:07.942
REALIZE.

15:08.011 --> 15:09.510
SO GIVEN THAT, AS WE PREPARE FOR

15:09.579 --> 15:11.345
OUR ANNUAL TRADITION OF STUFFING

15:11.414 --> 15:11.946
AS MUCH OF IT IN OUR FACES AS

15:12.015 --> 15:12.880
HUMANLY POSSIBLE,

15:12.949 --> 15:13.781
TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

15:13.850 --> 15:15.483
CHOCOLATE.

15:15.552 --> 15:16.451
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

15:16.520 --> 15:18.619
THAT COCOA IS MOSTLY GROWN ON

15:18.688 --> 15:21.556
VERY SMALL, FAMILY-RUN PLOTS.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.057
THERE ARE ABOUT HALF A MILLION

15:23.126 --> 15:24.058
OF THEM IN IVORY COAST, AND

15:24.127 --> 15:25.126
ANOTHER 800,000 IN

15:25.195 --> 15:27.295
GHANA.

15:27.364 --> 15:29.163
HARVESTING COCOA PODS IS LABOR

15:29.232 --> 15:30.264
INTENSIVE, AND DONE ENTIRELY BY

15:30.333 --> 15:31.399
HAND.

15:31.468 --> 15:32.433
AND BY THE WAY -- WHAT'S INSIDE

15:32.502 --> 15:33.201
THEM MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE

15:33.270 --> 15:34.035
PICTURING IN YOUR

15:34.104 --> 15:35.703
MIND.

15:35.772 --> 15:37.438
>> IVANS KANUBE CRACKS OPEN THE

15:37.507 --> 15:38.606
PODS TO EXTRACT THE SWEET, SLIMY

15:38.675 --> 15:41.175
BEAN, WHICH AT THIS STAGE HAS A

15:41.244 --> 15:43.478
FLAVOR LIKE LYCHEE FRUIT.

15:43.547 --> 15:44.979
ONCE THE COCOA IS

15:45.048 --> 15:47.448
COLLECTED, IT'S LEFT TO FERMENT

15:47.517 --> 15:48.583
UNDER BANANA LEAVES FOR ABOUT

15:48.652 --> 15:49.851
SEVEN DAYS.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.953
>> John: YEAH, THAT SLIMY BEAN

15:52.022 --> 15:54.522
SOUP IS COCOA.

15:54.591 --> 15:56.390
CHOCOLATE STARTS OUT AS GLUEY

15:56.459 --> 15:58.025
WHITE INSECT LARVA THAT COMES

15:58.094 --> 15:59.427
OUT OF A BIG TREE

15:59.496 --> 16:00.061
EGG, AND IT'S ONLY AFTER A LONG

16:00.130 --> 16:01.395
PROCESS THAT THAT FERMENTING

16:01.464 --> 16:02.730
FOREST JIZZ BECOMES SOMETHING

16:02.799 --> 16:04.599
MORE APPETIZING.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.067
OR IN THE CASE OF A MOUNDS BAR,

16:06.136 --> 16:08.936
EVEN LESS APPETIZING.

16:09.005 --> 16:10.404
FROM THE FARM, THE COCOA THEN

16:10.473 --> 16:11.539
PASSES THROUGH A NUMBER OF HANDS

16:11.608 --> 16:13.641
ON ITS WAY

16:13.710 --> 16:14.609
TO THE CHOCOLATE COMPANIES --

16:14.678 --> 16:16.911
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THE

16:16.980 --> 16:17.712
BEANS, TO THE

16:17.781 --> 16:18.312
WAREHOUSES WHO STORE THEM --

16:18.381 --> 16:18.913
EACH OF

16:18.982 --> 16:19.781
WHOM GETS PAID FOR THEIR PART IN

16:19.850 --> 16:21.082
THE CHAIN.

16:21.151 --> 16:22.717
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT, THEY ALL

16:22.786 --> 16:23.885
FEED INTO ONE NARROW BOTTLENECK,

16:23.954 --> 16:24.852
AS THIS EXPERT

16:24.921 --> 16:26.154
EXPLAINS IN AN ALMOST

16:26.223 --> 16:28.689
UNNERVINGLY SOOTHING WAY.

16:28.758 --> 16:29.757
>> IN A WAY, THE STORY OF

16:29.826 --> 16:30.591
CHOCOLATE IS A

16:30.660 --> 16:34.228
LITTLE BIT LIKE AN HOURGLASS,

16:34.297 --> 16:34.762
WHERE YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF

16:34.831 --> 16:37.131
SMALLHOLDERS

16:37.200 --> 16:39.033
GROWING COCOA AT THE VERY

16:39.102 --> 16:42.003
BEGINNING OF THE STORY, AND AT

16:42.072 --> 16:42.603
THE END OF THE STORY, YOU HAVE

16:42.672 --> 16:43.304
MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS EATING

16:43.373 --> 16:44.505
CHOCOLATE.

16:44.574 --> 16:45.773
BUT RIGHT AT THE CENTER OF THE

16:45.842 --> 16:47.108
HOURGLASS ARE A HANDFUL OF

16:47.177 --> 16:49.110
EXTREMELY POWERFUL COMPANIES.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.745
THESE COMPANIES ARE THE COCOA

16:50.814 --> 16:52.046
TRADERS.

16:52.115 --> 16:55.349
>> John: OKAY.

16:55.418 --> 16:56.717
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION

16:56.786 --> 16:58.519
OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS, FROM

16:58.588 --> 16:59.954
WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS A NINE

17:00.023 --> 17:01.689
HOUR YOUTUBE

17:01.758 --> 17:04.792
VIDEO TITLED, "WOMAN EXPLAINS

17:04.861 --> 17:05.359
COCOA SECTOR INEQUALITY ASMR

17:05.428 --> 17:06.327
FALL ASLEEP NOW HIGH

17:06.396 --> 17:08.963
QUALITY HEADPHONES ON".

17:09.032 --> 17:10.298
BUT IT'S TRUE -- THE INDUSTRY IS

17:10.367 --> 17:11.766
DOMINATED BY JUST A HANDFUL OF

17:11.835 --> 17:13.134
COCOA TRADING

17:13.203 --> 17:14.435
COMPANIES, THE MOST POWERFUL OF

17:14.504 --> 17:15.203
WHICH ARE THE SO-CALLED BIG

17:15.272 --> 17:17.505
THREE -- CARGILL, BARRY

17:17.574 --> 17:19.340
CALLEBAUT AND OFI, WHICH

17:19.409 --> 17:20.374
TOGETHER BUY AND

17:20.443 --> 17:21.742
PROCESS ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE

17:21.811 --> 17:23.711
WORLD'S COCOA.

17:23.780 --> 17:25.346
THEY THEN SELL TO A HANDFUL OF

17:25.415 --> 17:26.247
MAJOR CHOCOLATE COMPANIES:

17:26.316 --> 17:27.882
MARS, MONDELEZ -- WHICH OWNS

17:27.951 --> 17:28.616
CADBURY

17:28.685 --> 17:29.951
-- FERRERO, NESTLÉ, AND HERSHEY,

17:30.020 --> 17:31.819
WHICH TOGETHER SELL OVER HALF

17:31.888 --> 17:33.387
THE WORLD'S CHOCOLATE.

17:33.456 --> 17:35.289
AND WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY

17:35.358 --> 17:36.958
FARMERS, AND SO FEW BUYERS, THE

17:37.027 --> 17:38.025
BUYERS CLEARLY HAVE A BIG

17:38.094 --> 17:39.327
ADVANTAGE.

17:39.396 --> 17:41.362
THAT'S WHY ONLY ABOUT 6 PERCENT

17:41.431 --> 17:42.797
OF THE VALUE OF A CHOCOLATE BAR

17:42.866 --> 17:43.464
MAKES ITS WAY BACK TO THE

17:43.533 --> 17:44.632
FARMER.

17:44.701 --> 17:46.701
AND LOOK -- I'M NOT SAYING THOSE

17:46.770 --> 17:47.502
COMPANIES AREN'T ADDING REAL

17:47.571 --> 17:48.369
VALUE TO THEIR PART OF THE

17:48.438 --> 17:49.270
PROCESS.

17:49.339 --> 17:50.538
THEY ARE!

17:50.607 --> 17:52.874
THIS HALLOWEEN, TRY OFFERING A

17:52.943 --> 17:54.642
SPIDERMAN A KITKAT OR A HANDFUL

17:54.711 --> 17:57.011
OF STICKY WHITE BEAN LARVA AND

17:57.080 --> 17:57.879
SEE WHICH THEY PREFER.

17:57.948 --> 18:00.715
BUT THERE ARE CLEARLY MASSIVE

18:00.784 --> 18:01.983
DISPARITIES IN WHO REAPS THE

18:02.052 --> 18:03.184
BENEFITS OF THIS

18:03.253 --> 18:04.652
EXTREMELY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY.

18:04.721 --> 18:05.686
AND I WILL SAY -- THERE ARE

18:05.755 --> 18:06.988
MECHANISMS IN

18:07.057 --> 18:08.122
PLACE TO AT LEAST HELP STABILIZE

18:08.191 --> 18:09.657
THE AMOUNT FARMERS EARN.

18:09.726 --> 18:11.225
BOTH GHANA AND IVORY COAST SET

18:11.294 --> 18:12.393
MINIMUM PRICES THAT FARMERS

18:12.462 --> 18:13.761
RECEIVE FOR THEIR COCOA.

18:13.830 --> 18:16.597
THE PROBLEM IS, THOSE PRICES ARE

18:16.666 --> 18:17.799
NOT ONLY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE,

18:17.868 --> 18:19.834
BUT CRUCIALLY, THEY'RE NOT

18:19.903 --> 18:21.469
ENOUGH TO COVER THE

18:21.538 --> 18:23.070
COSTS OF FARMING.

18:23.139 --> 18:26.207
AND SO SOME FARMERS, MOST OF

18:26.276 --> 18:26.808
WHOM ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREME

18:26.877 --> 18:28.009
POVERTY, HAVE RESORTED TO TRYING

18:28.078 --> 18:29.744
TO INCREASE THEIR EARNINGS BY

18:29.813 --> 18:30.878
GROWING MORE COCOA ON

18:30.947 --> 18:32.180
LAND THAT'S PROTECTED BY THE

18:32.249 --> 18:33.815
GOVERNMENT.

18:33.884 --> 18:35.049
WHICH IS ILLEGAL, BECAUSE IT CAN

18:35.118 --> 18:36.284
DO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL

18:36.353 --> 18:37.785
DAMAGE.

18:37.854 --> 18:38.986
>> DESPERATE

18:39.055 --> 18:40.354
FARMERS SUPPLEMENT THEIR CROP BY

18:40.423 --> 18:41.756
GROWING COCOA TREES IN A

18:41.825 --> 18:43.357
PROTECTED FOREST, WHERE THE

18:43.426 --> 18:44.459
UNCULTIVATED SOIL IS MORE

18:44.528 --> 18:45.993
FERTILE,

18:46.062 --> 18:47.261
AND STOLEN LAND IS, IN EFFECT,

18:47.330 --> 18:49.397
FREE OF CHARGE.

18:49.466 --> 18:50.965
WHAT'S LEFT BEHIND IS KNOWN AS A

18:51.034 --> 18:53.134
SKELETON FOREST.

18:53.203 --> 18:53.935
>> John: OKAY, LET'S FACE IT:

18:54.004 --> 18:55.336
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

18:55.405 --> 18:57.038
BEFORE THE PHRASE "SKELETON

18:57.107 --> 18:58.506
FOREST" APPEARED ON THIS SHOW.

18:58.575 --> 18:59.707
BECAUSE IF THERE'S A SINISTER

18:59.776 --> 19:00.942
COMBINATION OF WORDS OUT THERE,

19:01.011 --> 19:02.977
WE'RE GONNA STUMBLE OVER IT.

19:03.046 --> 19:05.379
TUMOR ELECTIONS?

19:05.448 --> 19:06.714
GHOST ABUSE?

19:06.783 --> 19:07.648
MURDER POLLUTION?

19:07.717 --> 19:08.249
STAY TUNED.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.218
ALL THOSE ARE COMING UP.

19:10.287 --> 19:12.019
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTAL

19:12.088 --> 19:13.554
DAMAGE -- THERE'S ALSO

19:13.623 --> 19:15.323
SIGNIFICANT HUMAN COST IN

19:15.392 --> 19:18.059
COCOA FARMING, WHICH HAS BEEN

19:18.128 --> 19:19.327
WELLKNOWN FOR A WHILE.

19:19.396 --> 19:20.862
AROUND 20 YEARS AGO, A SERIES OF

19:20.931 --> 19:22.263
NEWS STORIES AND A DOCUMENTARY

19:22.332 --> 19:24.031
FOUND THAT YOUNG

19:24.100 --> 19:25.032
CHILDREN -- SOME OF WHOM HAD

19:25.101 --> 19:26.400
BEEN ENSLAVED OR TRAFFICKED --

19:26.469 --> 19:27.902
WERE WORKING ON COCOA FARMS THAT

19:27.971 --> 19:29.203
SUPPLIED MAJOR CHOCOLATE

19:29.272 --> 19:30.438
COMPANIES.

19:30.507 --> 19:31.539
AND IN THE WAKE OF PUBLIC HORROR

19:31.608 --> 19:33.074
OVER THIS, COMPANIES DIDN'T DO

19:33.143 --> 19:34.408
THEMSELVES ANY FAVORS WITH HOW

19:34.477 --> 19:35.676
THEY RESPONDED.

19:35.745 --> 19:37.044
JUST LISTEN TO THE ANSWERS THAT

19:37.113 --> 19:38.913
THIS DUTCH JOURNALIST GOT WHEN

19:38.982 --> 19:39.947
HE ASKED NESTLE ABOUT WHETHER

19:40.016 --> 19:40.982
CHILDREN WERE INVOLVED IN MAKING

19:41.051 --> 19:42.750
ITS CHOCOLATE.

19:42.819 --> 19:43.851
>> CHILDREN ARE WORKING IN

19:43.920 --> 19:45.119
VIRTUALLY

19:45.188 --> 19:47.989
EVERY SINGLE AGRICULTURAL SETUP

19:48.058 --> 19:49.590
AROUND THE WORLD.

19:49.659 --> 19:51.125
>> YES.

19:51.194 --> 19:51.926
>> OKAY?

19:51.995 --> 19:52.794
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I

19:52.863 --> 19:53.661
WAS 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD, I WENT

19:53.730 --> 19:55.496
TO HELP A FARMER.

19:55.565 --> 19:56.531
>> I DID NOT GET PAID -- PAID

19:56.600 --> 19:57.265
FOR IT.

19:57.334 --> 19:58.266
I DID IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT

19:58.335 --> 20:00.468
WAS -- IT WAS FUN.

20:00.537 --> 20:01.836
THAT WAS CHILD LABOR.

20:01.905 --> 20:03.738
A CHILD WORKING.

20:03.807 --> 20:05.173
>> AND THAT'S THE SAME.

20:05.242 --> 20:07.475
>> IT'S NOT THE SAME.

20:07.544 --> 20:08.476
EVIDENTLY.

20:08.545 --> 20:09.277
I DIDN'T

20:09.346 --> 20:10.445
NEED TO DO THAT.

20:10.514 --> 20:11.212
OKAY?

20:11.281 --> 20:12.313
>> YEAH.

20:12.382 --> 20:13.347
>> John: RIGHT.

20:13.416 --> 20:15.183
NOT TO STRESS THE MOST OBVIOUS

20:15.252 --> 20:16.217
POINT IN THE UNIVERSE, BUT --

20:16.286 --> 20:17.652
DOING SOMETHING FOR FUN ISN'T

20:17.721 --> 20:18.419
THE SAME THING

20:18.488 --> 20:19.887
AS DOING IT TO SURVIVE.

20:19.956 --> 20:21.289
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE

20:21.358 --> 20:22.323
BETWEEN BEING IN AN ESCAPE ROOM,

20:22.392 --> 20:24.959
AND BEING IN A SAW MOVIE.

20:25.028 --> 20:26.394
SURE, THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY BAD

20:26.463 --> 20:27.929
FIRST DATE IDEAS, BUT THAT'S

20:27.998 --> 20:28.729
WHERE THE SIMILARITIES

20:28.798 --> 20:30.865
END.

20:30.934 --> 20:32.567
AND LOOK -- I WILL GIVE HIM

20:32.636 --> 20:32.900
THIS: A LOT OF

20:32.969 --> 20:34.302
CHILD LABOR DOES CONSIST OF KIDS

20:34.371 --> 20:35.336
WORKING ON THEIR OWN FAMILIES'

20:35.405 --> 20:36.471
COCOA FARMS.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.005
THOUGH EVEN IN THOSE CASES, THEY

20:38.074 --> 20:39.140
CAN BE DOING SO IN HAZARDOUS

20:39.209 --> 20:40.341
CONDITIONS.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.777
AND ALSO -- WATCH AS THAT NESTLE

20:42.846 --> 20:43.711
SPOKESPERSON ACCIDENTALLY WALKS

20:43.780 --> 20:45.980
INTO A PRETTY DAMAGING ADMISSION

20:46.049 --> 20:46.781
OF EXACTLY

20:46.850 --> 20:48.049
WHY THEY MIGHT BE HAVING TO DO

20:48.118 --> 20:49.484
THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:49.553 --> 20:50.885
>> FOR A POOR

20:50.954 --> 20:53.788
FARMER IN -- IN AFRICA,

20:53.857 --> 20:54.555
OFTEN THE HELP THAT HE GETS FROM

20:54.624 --> 20:55.523
HIS CHILDREN

20:55.592 --> 20:58.092
IS VITAL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

20:58.161 --> 20:58.960
THE STANDARD OF LIVING OF THE

20:59.029 --> 21:00.661
FAMILY.

21:00.730 --> 21:01.762
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE -- THEY --

21:01.831 --> 21:02.763
>> BECAUSE THEY ARE SO

21:02.832 --> 21:04.232
DESPERATELY POOR.

21:04.301 --> 21:06.167
>> BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET

21:06.236 --> 21:07.668
PAID ENOUGH BY NESTLÉ, OR BY THE

21:07.737 --> 21:11.839
COMPANIES THEY WORK FOR.

21:11.908 --> 21:12.340
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

21:12.409 --> 21:12.774
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:12.843 --> 21:13.107
>> John: WOW.

21:13.176 --> 21:14.242
IT'S VERY FUNNY TO ME THAT HE

21:14.311 --> 21:14.876
THOUGHT ENDING THAT CALL WHEN HE

21:14.945 --> 21:15.643
DID WAS SOMEHOW "AVOIDING"

21:15.712 --> 21:16.744
IMPLICATING HIMSELF.

21:16.813 --> 21:19.113
"LOOK, THE FARMERS HAVE TO MAKE

21:19.182 --> 21:20.348
THEIR CHILDREN WORK FOR THEM,

21:20.417 --> 21:21.649
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO POOR,

21:21.718 --> 21:22.650
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PAID A

21:22.719 --> 21:24.986
LIVING WAGE BY NESTLE, THE

21:25.055 --> 21:25.620
COMPANY THAT I -- YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:25.689 --> 21:26.921
NICE TRY, YOU'RE BREAKING UP,

21:26.990 --> 21:27.922
I'M GOING INTO A TUNNEL.

21:27.991 --> 21:29.056
GOODBYE!

21:29.125 --> 21:29.824
WHEW, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

21:29.893 --> 21:31.993
BUT I THINK I GOT AWAY WITH IT."

21:32.062 --> 21:33.761
AND, AGAIN -- IT'S NOT JUST KIDS

21:33.830 --> 21:36.097
WORKING ON THEIR FAMILY FARMS.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.965
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BE

21:38.034 --> 21:40.101
FORCED, OR TRAFFICKED, TO WORK

21:40.170 --> 21:41.169
IN COCOA PRODUCTION.

21:41.238 --> 21:42.103
AND WHILE, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

21:42.172 --> 21:42.937
OF THIS CRIME, EXACT NUMBERS

21:43.006 --> 21:44.272
AREN'T KNOWN, ONE

21:44.341 --> 21:45.873
SURVEY ESTIMATED THAT IN IVORY

21:45.942 --> 21:47.809
COAST, OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD,

21:47.878 --> 21:49.610
2,000 CHILDREN WERE VICTIMS OF

21:49.679 --> 21:50.778
FORCED LABOR, WHILE IN GHANA, IT

21:50.847 --> 21:53.314
WAS 14,000.

21:53.383 --> 21:54.515
AND BACK IN THE 2000S, OUTRAGE

21:54.584 --> 21:57.351
OVER THIS ACTUALLY SPURRED US

21:57.420 --> 21:58.352
LAWMAKERS TO TAKE ACTION.

21:58.421 --> 22:00.455
FIRST, THEY CONSIDERED MANDATING

22:00.524 --> 22:01.289
LABELS FOR CHOCOLATE, INDICATING

22:01.358 --> 22:02.256
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS MADE WITH

22:02.325 --> 22:04.592
CHILD SLAVE LABOR.

22:04.661 --> 22:06.127
BUT THE CHOCOLATE INDUSTRY THEN

22:06.196 --> 22:08.129
LOBBIED THAT DOWN TO A VOLUNTARY

22:08.198 --> 22:09.297
AGREEMENT TO ELIMINATE THE

22:09.366 --> 22:11.499
"WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR",

22:11.568 --> 22:12.667
PROMISING TO GET

22:12.736 --> 22:14.735
IT DONE BY JULY 2005.

22:14.804 --> 22:15.670
THAT AGREEMENT LATER BECAME

22:15.739 --> 22:16.971
KNOWN AS THE HARKIN-ENGEL

22:17.040 --> 22:18.239
PROTOCOL, AFTER THE

22:18.308 --> 22:20.675
TWO LAWMAKERS WHO'D PUSHED FOR

22:20.744 --> 22:21.242
IT -- BUT WHEN THE DEADLINE

22:21.311 --> 22:22.110
ROLLED AROUND,

22:22.179 --> 22:23.811
SENATOR HARKIN HAD THIS

22:23.880 --> 22:25.179
UNFORTUNATE UPDATE.

22:25.248 --> 22:26.380
>> THOUGH I WAS DISAPPOINTED

22:26.449 --> 22:28.216
THAT THE JULY 1ST DEADLINE WAS

22:28.285 --> 22:29.750
NOT FULLY MET BY THE INDUSTRY,

22:29.819 --> 22:31.886
THEY HAVE GIVEN US A COMMITMENT

22:31.955 --> 22:33.921
-- A COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING A

22:33.990 --> 22:35.590
CERTIFICATION SYSTEM WHICH CAN

22:35.659 --> 22:37.959
BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE COCOA

22:38.028 --> 22:40.128
GROWING AREAS OF WEST AFRICA,

22:40.197 --> 22:44.365
AND WHICH WILL COVER 50% OF THE

22:44.434 --> 22:46.467
COCOA-GROWING AREAS OF IVORY

22:46.536 --> 22:48.970
COAST AND GHANA IN THREE YEARS'

22:49.039 --> 22:50.938
TIME.  I'M VERY PLEASED WITH

22:51.007 --> 22:53.274
THIS COMMITMENT.

22:53.343 --> 22:54.742
>> John: ARE YOU?

22:54.811 --> 22:56.010
BECAUSE IF SO, I'M GENUINELY

22:56.079 --> 22:57.044
JEALOUS OF YOUR INFINITE

22:57.113 --> 22:58.045
CAPACITY FOR TRUSTING

22:58.114 --> 22:59.781
OTHERS.

22:59.850 --> 23:00.948
"AH, I SEE FROM THE FIRST PANEL

23:01.017 --> 23:01.549
OF TODAY'S PEANUTS COMIC THAT

23:01.618 --> 23:02.283
LUCY IS FINALLY GOING TO LET

23:02.352 --> 23:04.385
CHARLIE BROWN KICK

23:04.454 --> 23:04.719
THE FOOTBALL.

23:04.788 --> 23:06.053
WHILE I WAS DISAPPOINTED

23:06.122 --> 23:07.188
BY HER ACTIONS IN THE PAST, IT

23:07.257 --> 23:08.689
SEEMS THAT A NEW DAY HAS BROUGHT

23:08.758 --> 23:09.891
A SENSE OF INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS

23:09.960 --> 23:11.359
YOUNG GIRL, AND I

23:11.428 --> 23:12.860
AM VERY EXCITED TO MOVE MY GAZE

23:12.929 --> 23:13.795
DOWN THE PAGE AND SEE THIS

23:13.864 --> 23:14.796
COMMITMENT HONORED IN --

23:14.865 --> 23:16.998
WHAT?

23:17.067 --> 23:18.399
SHE DID IT AGAIN?

23:18.468 --> 23:19.767
AND PREDICTABLY, THE COMPANIES

23:19.836 --> 23:20.368
DIDN'T MEET THAT NEW DEADLINE

23:20.437 --> 23:22.069
EITHER.

23:22.138 --> 23:24.005
ONCE 2008 ROLLED AROUND, THEY

23:24.074 --> 23:25.673
KICKED IT TO 2010, THEN PUSHED

23:25.742 --> 23:26.774
IT "AGAIN", TO 2020 --

23:26.843 --> 23:28.843
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DOWNGRADING

23:28.912 --> 23:30.645
THEIR GOAL TO JUST GETTING A 70

23:30.714 --> 23:32.146
PERCENT REDUCTION IN CHILD

23:32.215 --> 23:34.315
LABOR, RATHER THAN ELIMINATING

23:34.384 --> 23:36.384
IT ENTIRELY, THEN

23:36.453 --> 23:37.585
MISSED THAT DEADLINE TOO.

23:37.654 --> 23:38.786
AND THE COMPANIES ALMOST

23:38.855 --> 23:39.887
CERTAINLY

23:39.956 --> 23:40.788
KNEW THEY WOULDN'T BE KEEPING

23:40.857 --> 23:42.824
THEIR PROMISES.

23:42.893 --> 23:43.691
AS THE FORMER HEAD OF THE

23:43.760 --> 23:45.793
INTERNATIONAL COCOA INITIATIVE

23:45.862 --> 23:46.894
PUT IT, "WAS THERE ANY CHANCE OF

23:46.963 --> 23:47.962
CHILD LABOR BEING ERADICATED BY

23:48.031 --> 23:48.796
THE ORIGINAL 2005

23:48.865 --> 23:49.564
DEADLINE?"

23:49.633 --> 23:51.165
NO, NEVER.

23:51.234 --> 23:53.434
AND AT THAT POINT, WHY BOTHER

23:53.503 --> 23:55.336
SETTING A DATE AT ALL?

23:55.405 --> 23:57.071
IF YOUR FRIEND AGREES TO MEET

23:57.140 --> 23:59.040
YOU FOR DINNER AT 7, THEN PUSHES

23:59.109 --> 24:01.442
IT TO 7:30, THEN 8, AND FINALLY

24:01.511 --> 24:03.010
SAYS "BE THERE IN 20 -- YEARS

24:03.079 --> 24:04.946
NOT MINUTES,"

24:05.015 --> 24:06.314
IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THEY NEVER

24:06.383 --> 24:07.715
HAD ANY INTENTION OF GETTING

24:07.784 --> 24:08.149
DINNER IN THE FIRST

24:08.218 --> 24:09.450
PLACE.

24:09.519 --> 24:11.252
AND I WILL SAY -- IT'S NOT LIKE

24:11.321 --> 24:12.053
THE CHOCOLATE COMPANIES HAVE

24:12.122 --> 24:13.688
DONE NOTHING.

24:13.757 --> 24:14.489
THEY ALL STARTED FLASHY-LOOKING

24:14.558 --> 24:16.491
PROGRAMS WITH "COCOA"

24:16.560 --> 24:18.392
IN THEIR NAMES THAT PROMISED TO

24:18.461 --> 24:19.393
BE VIGILANT ABOUT MONITORING FOR

24:19.462 --> 24:22.029
CHILD LABOR, AND PRODUCED

24:22.098 --> 24:24.132
IMPRESSIVE-LOOKING ADS FEATURING

24:24.201 --> 24:25.433
HAPPY FARMERS, AND WEBSITES

24:25.502 --> 24:26.100
SHOWING HOW CAREFULLY THEY

24:26.169 --> 24:28.102
MONITOR THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN.

24:28.171 --> 24:29.871
BUT THE REALITY HASN'T REMOTELY

24:29.940 --> 24:31.405
LIVED UP TO THE RHETORIC.

24:31.474 --> 24:32.306
LAST YEAR, SOME JOURNALISTS

24:32.375 --> 24:33.608
LOOKED AT A MAP OF FARMS ON

24:33.677 --> 24:34.942
MONDELEZ'S "COCOA LIFE"

24:35.011 --> 24:36.744
WEBSITE, THEN SENT A CAMERA CREW

24:36.813 --> 24:38.646
TO GHANA TO CHECK SOME OUT, AND

24:38.715 --> 24:39.947
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THEY

24:40.016 --> 24:41.816
FOUND.

24:41.885 --> 24:43.451
>> IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO FIND

24:43.520 --> 24:45.319
CHILDREN WORKING ON A FARM

24:45.388 --> 24:47.155
MATCHING THE COORDINATES LISTED

24:47.224 --> 24:49.257
ON THE COCOA LIFE WEBSITE.

24:49.326 --> 24:50.491
THE TEAM FILMED TWO

24:50.560 --> 24:52.727
YOUNG BOYS AGED 10 AND 11,

24:52.796 --> 24:57.465
HARVESTING COCOA PODS USING LONG

24:57.534 --> 24:58.633
STICKS WITH SHARP HOOKS AND

24:58.702 --> 25:00.101
WEARING NO PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.

25:00.170 --> 25:01.335
>> John: YEAH, THEY WENT TO JUST

25:01.404 --> 25:03.905
ONE OF THE FARMS LISTED ON THEIR

25:03.974 --> 25:05.206
SITE -- A SITE FILLED WITH

25:05.275 --> 25:06.307
CLAIMS THAT CHILD LABOR IS

25:06.376 --> 25:06.908
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE -- AND

25:06.977 --> 25:07.909
INSTANTLY FOUND

25:07.978 --> 25:09.310
CHILD LABOR.

25:09.379 --> 25:10.111
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT STATEMENT

25:10.180 --> 25:10.845
MONDELEZ CAN RELEASE IN THE WAKE

25:10.914 --> 25:12.046
OF THAT, OTHER THAN MAYBE,

25:12.115 --> 25:13.047
"HONESTLY DID NOT THINK ANYONE

25:13.116 --> 25:14.849
WOULD ACTUALLY CHECK."

25:14.918 --> 25:15.850
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

25:15.919 --> 25:17.151
"OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T TRUST

25:17.220 --> 25:18.519
COMPANIES TO MONITOR

25:18.588 --> 25:19.287
THEMSELVES -- THAT'S WHY THERE

25:19.356 --> 25:19.987
SHOULD BE A THIRD PARTY

25:20.056 --> 25:20.888
INVOLVED."

25:20.957 --> 25:22.323
THE THING IS, THOSE HAVE ALSO

25:22.392 --> 25:23.958
EXISTED FOR YEARS -- CHOCOLATE

25:24.027 --> 25:25.693
COMPANIES HAVE LONG

25:25.762 --> 25:26.527
PURCHASED AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR

25:26.596 --> 25:28.262
BEANS FROM THIRD-PARTY

25:28.331 --> 25:30.097
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THESE, WHO

25:30.166 --> 25:31.599
CERTIFY THE FARMERS WHO

25:31.668 --> 25:33.468
SUPPLY THEM HAVE MET CERTAIN

25:33.537 --> 25:34.302
CHILD LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL

25:34.371 --> 25:35.169
STANDARDS.

25:35.238 --> 25:36.971
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ONE OF THESE

25:37.040 --> 25:38.139
LOGOS ON A CHOCOLATE BAR AND

25:38.208 --> 25:39.774
FELT REASSURED BY IT.

25:39.843 --> 25:41.375
BUT WHILE ADVOCATES SAY SOME OF

25:41.444 --> 25:42.810
THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

25:42.879 --> 25:44.779
IMPROVED CONDITIONS SOMEWHAT,

25:44.848 --> 25:46.414
THESE LOGOS JUST

25:46.483 --> 25:47.482
AREN'T THE GUARANTEE YOU MIGHT

25:47.551 --> 25:48.516
WANT THEM TO BE.

25:48.585 --> 25:49.550
FOR A START, WHILE THE

25:49.619 --> 25:50.852
ORGANIZATIONS PAY

25:50.921 --> 25:52.019
FARMERS A SMALL PREMIUM FOR

25:52.088 --> 25:52.620
MEETING THEIR STANDARDS, THOSE

25:52.689 --> 25:53.788
PREMIUMS MIGHT

25:53.857 --> 25:54.589
NOT EVEN COVER THE COST OF

25:54.658 --> 25:56.124
COMPLYING WITH THE PROGRAM.

25:56.193 --> 25:58.292
BUT ALSO, INSPECTIONS FOR THE

25:58.361 --> 25:59.894
LABELS ARE REQUIRED

25:59.963 --> 26:01.395
OF FEWER THAN 1 IN 10 FARMS

26:01.464 --> 26:02.830
ANNUALLY.

26:02.899 --> 26:04.298
AND JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED

26:04.367 --> 26:06.267
WHEN REPORTERS WENT UNDERCOVER

26:06.336 --> 26:08.202
AS CHOCOLATE COMPANY EXECUTIVES,

26:08.271 --> 26:08.836
AND VISITED A CONTRACTOR WHO DID

26:08.905 --> 26:09.871
AUDITS FOR "UTZ", ONE OF THOSE

26:09.940 --> 26:11.773
THIRD-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS.

26:11.842 --> 26:13.441
BECAUSE HE EXPLAINS TO THEM

26:13.510 --> 26:14.942
EXACTLY WHY HE'S CONFIDENT THAT

26:15.011 --> 26:17.879
HE WON'T FIND CHILD

26:17.948 --> 26:24.948
LABOR ON ANY FARM HE VISITS.

26:28.124 --> 26:29.524
>> WHEN YOU GO TO THEM YOU'RE

26:29.593 --> 26:31.159
NOT GOING TO SEE ANY CHILDREN.

26:31.228 --> 26:32.059
>> John: IT'S TRUE -- AUDITORS

26:32.128 --> 26:33.628
GIVE ADVANCE NOTICE OF

26:33.697 --> 26:34.395
INSPECTIONS.

26:34.464 --> 26:35.196
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

26:35.265 --> 26:35.830
BECAUSE THAT'S NEVER GOING TO BE

26:35.899 --> 26:37.632
RELIABLE.

26:37.701 --> 26:39.300
IF YOU TELL YOUR TEENAGER "I'M

26:39.369 --> 26:41.502
CHECKING YOUR BACKPACK FOR

26:41.571 --> 26:43.404
CIGARETTES NEXT TUESDAY,"

26:43.473 --> 26:44.138
THEN GREAT NEWS, YOU'RE

26:44.207 --> 26:47.074
NOT GONNA FIND ANY.

26:47.143 --> 26:54.048
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, UTZ

26:54.117 --> 26:54.649
MAINTAIN AND HOLD AUDITORS TO

26:54.718 --> 26:57.018
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS.

26:57.087 --> 27:01.322
DO NOT SEEM TO HIDE TO ME.

27:01.391 --> 27:02.490
AS FOR MONDELEZ, WHO, REMEMBER,

27:02.559 --> 27:02.890
-- AS HIGH TO ME.

27:02.959 --> 27:05.059
TURNED OUT TO HAVE CHILD LABOR

27:05.128 --> 27:05.793
AT ONE OF ITS SUPPLIERS IN

27:05.862 --> 27:06.360
GHANA, IT SAID THAT IT WAS

27:06.429 --> 27:06.928
"DEEPLY CONCERNED" BY THESE

27:06.997 --> 27:07.562
INCIDENTS, AND, OKAY THAT MAKES

27:07.631 --> 27:09.163
TWO OF US, MONDELEZ.

27:09.232 --> 27:10.998
IT ALSO WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT

27:11.067 --> 27:12.600
IT HAS A CHILD LABOR MONITORING

27:12.669 --> 27:13.234
SYSTEM IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS

27:13.303 --> 27:14.936
KIND OF THING FROM HAPPENING.

27:15.005 --> 27:16.971
WHICH IS VERY REASSURING, UNTIL

27:17.040 --> 27:18.005
YOU REMEMBER IT ONLY TOOK A

27:18.074 --> 27:19.006
DOCUMENTARY CREW ONE FLIGHT TO

27:19.075 --> 27:20.508
GHANA TO PROVE THAT

27:20.577 --> 27:21.542
SYSTEM IS, AT BEST, DEEPLY

27:21.611 --> 27:23.811
INADEQUATE.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.113
AND THAT'S THE THING -- ALL

27:25.182 --> 27:27.081
THESE COMPANIES WILL SAY THEY'RE

27:27.150 --> 27:29.250
CONCERNED ABOUT CHILD LABOR, AND

27:29.319 --> 27:30.384
THAT THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF

27:30.453 --> 27:31.486
MONEY TRYING TO FIX IT.

27:31.555 --> 27:32.787
BY ONE ESTIMATE, AS OF 2019,

27:32.856 --> 27:34.088
THEY'D SPENT

27:34.157 --> 27:35.389
MORE THAN $150 MILLION TO

27:35.458 --> 27:37.091
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.560
BUT THAT'S OVER 18 YEARS, AND

27:39.629 --> 27:40.862
WHILE THEY WERE COLLECTING $103

27:40.931 --> 27:43.064
BILLION IN SALES ANNUALLY.

27:43.133 --> 27:45.433
MEANING THAT OVER TWO DECADES,

27:45.502 --> 27:48.236
THEY'VE SPENT JUST 0.1 PERCENT

27:48.305 --> 27:49.871
OF ONE YEAR'S SALES.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.105
AND COME ON!

27:51.174 --> 27:52.406
M&M'S MUST'VE SPENT MORE THAN

27:52.475 --> 27:54.142
THAT, FINE-TUNING EXACTLY HOW

27:54.211 --> 27:57.845
FUCKABLE THE GREEN M&M IS.

27:57.914 --> 28:00.047
AND FOR ALL THE COMPANIES'

28:00.116 --> 28:00.982
CLAIMS OF CONCERN, THE FACT

28:01.051 --> 28:01.949
REMAINS: ACCORDING TO

28:02.018 --> 28:03.317
THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AN

28:03.386 --> 28:05.953
ESTIMATED 1.5 MILLION CHILDREN

28:06.022 --> 28:07.388
WORK IN COCOA PRODUCTION IN

28:07.457 --> 28:08.689
GHANA AND IVORY

28:08.758 --> 28:09.323
COAST, MANY OF WHOM ARE ENGAGED

28:09.392 --> 28:10.925
IN DANGEROUS TASKS.

28:10.994 --> 28:11.993
OR, AS A WASHINGTON POST

28:12.062 --> 28:13.060
INVESTIGATION

28:13.129 --> 28:13.861
CONCLUDED, "THE ODDS ARE

28:13.930 --> 28:15.463
SUBSTANTIAL THAT A

28:15.532 --> 28:16.697
CHOCOLATE BAR BOUGHT IN THE

28:16.766 --> 28:17.598
UNITED STATES IS THE PRODUCT OF

28:17.667 --> 28:19.300
CHILD LABOR."

28:19.369 --> 28:20.501
IN FACT, THE PERSISTENCE OF IT

28:20.570 --> 28:21.636
IN THE SUPPLY

28:21.705 --> 28:23.538
CHAIN IS AN OPEN SECRET.

28:23.607 --> 28:25.039
JUST WATCH AS SOME YOUNG WORKERS

28:25.108 --> 28:26.307
END UP JOKING ABOUT IT, WHEN

28:26.376 --> 28:26.874
ASKED BY

28:26.943 --> 28:33.943
VISITING JOURNALISTS.

28:51.067 --> 28:58.067
[LAUGHTER]

28:59.409 --> 29:00.608
>> John: YEAH, WE ALL FONDLY

29:00.677 --> 29:02.376
REMEMBER BEING 21.

29:02.445 --> 29:03.644
SMALL FRAME, CHILDLIKE VOICE,

29:03.713 --> 29:04.779
ANOTHER

29:04.848 --> 29:05.613
GUY HAS TO CONSTANTLY REMIND YOU

29:05.682 --> 29:07.081
YOU'RE 21.

29:07.150 --> 29:08.015
JUST CLASSIC EARLY TWENTIES

29:08.084 --> 29:09.951
STUFF.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.252
AND I KNOW THEY WERE LAUGHING

29:11.321 --> 29:12.286
THERE -- AND THAT CLIP WAS

29:12.355 --> 29:13.020
HONESTLY KIND OF

29:13.089 --> 29:14.122
CHARMING.

29:14.191 --> 29:15.423
BUT THE TRUTH IS, FOR OTHERS,

29:15.492 --> 29:16.791
THE STORIES ARE PRETTY HARROWING

29:16.860 --> 29:17.625
-- LIKE THIS YOUNG GIRL WHO SAID

29:17.694 --> 29:18.559
THAT AT THIS POINT, SHE'D

29:18.628 --> 29:19.861
ALREADY BEEN FARMING COCOA FOR

29:19.930 --> 29:22.430
FIVE YEARS.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.531
>> I WAS BROUGHT

29:23.600 --> 29:24.532
HERE BY MY AUNT, I WAS TOLD I

29:24.601 --> 29:28.369
WOULD BE HELPING WITH THE BABY,

29:28.438 --> 29:28.970
BUT INSTEAD I ONLY DO FARMING.

29:29.039 --> 29:29.804
>> SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO GO

29:29.873 --> 29:30.772
TO SCHOOL, BUT HER UNCLE CAN'T

29:30.841 --> 29:32.273
AFFORD TO SEND HER.

29:32.342 --> 29:33.374
>> MY UNCLE SAYS HE STRUGGLES TO

29:33.443 --> 29:35.576
PAY FOR HIS OWN CHILDREN, SO IF

29:35.645 --> 29:37.044
I JOIN THEM, HE WILL NOT BE ABLE

29:37.113 --> 29:38.813
TO BUY THE SCHOOL BOOKS.

29:38.882 --> 29:39.847
>> WE ASKED IF SHE MISSES HER

29:39.916 --> 29:40.982
FAMILY.

29:41.051 --> 29:41.949
>> YES.

29:42.018 --> 29:43.484
>> DO YOU HEAR FROM THEM?

29:43.553 --> 29:45.353
>> NO.

29:45.422 --> 29:46.487
>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BACK TO

29:46.556 --> 29:47.955
VISIT THEM SINCE YOU CAME HERE?

29:48.024 --> 29:49.624
>> NO.

29:49.693 --> 29:50.792
>> John: THAT'S HEARTBREAKING.

29:50.861 --> 29:51.926
AND THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE A

29:51.995 --> 29:54.061
LOT MORE CLIPS OUT THERE LIKE

29:54.130 --> 29:54.962
THAT ONE THAN THERE

29:55.031 --> 29:56.731
ARE OF KIDS JOKING AROUND ABOUT

29:56.800 --> 29:58.032
BEING 21.

29:58.101 --> 29:59.400
AND AT THIS POINT YOU MIGHT BE

29:59.469 --> 30:00.301
WONDERING -- WHAT CAN WE DO

30:00.370 --> 30:01.469
DIFFERENTLY?

30:01.538 --> 30:02.703
WELL, I'LL ADMIT -- IT'S REALLY

30:02.772 --> 30:04.105
COMPLICATED.

30:04.174 --> 30:05.106
CHILD LABOR IN THESE REGIONS IS

30:05.175 --> 30:05.973
CAUSED BY A MYRIAD OF ISSUES,

30:06.042 --> 30:07.442
FROM POOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO

30:07.511 --> 30:08.443
LIMITED ACCESS TO

30:08.512 --> 30:09.444
EDUCATION.

30:09.513 --> 30:11.012
BUT TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT, IT

30:11.081 --> 30:12.980
IS CAUSED BY POVERTY.

30:13.049 --> 30:15.116
A POVERTY THAT IS ACTIVELY

30:15.185 --> 30:16.050
PERPETUATED BY THESE CHOCOLATE

30:16.119 --> 30:17.852
COMPANIES.

30:17.921 --> 30:19.153
AND IF THEY REALLY WANT TO

30:19.222 --> 30:21.088
REMEDY THINGS, A GOOD FIRST STEP

30:21.157 --> 30:22.223
WOULD SIMPLY BE

30:22.292 --> 30:23.724
TO PAY FARMERS MORE.

30:23.793 --> 30:26.694
AND COMPANIES MAY BALK AT THAT,

30:26.763 --> 30:27.528
SAYING THEY DON'T SET THE PRICE,

30:27.597 --> 30:28.596
THE MARKET DOES.

30:28.665 --> 30:29.263
BUT AS THIS ADVOCATE POINTS OUT,

30:29.332 --> 30:29.497
THAT'S A

30:29.566 --> 30:30.698
PRETTY LOUSY EXCUSE.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.533
>> EVERY TRADER AND EVERY

30:32.602 --> 30:34.802
MULTINATIONAL I SPEAK TO ALWAYS

30:34.871 --> 30:35.670
SAY, BUT THAT'S THE WORLD MARKET

30:35.739 --> 30:36.637
PRICE.

30:36.706 --> 30:37.505
WE HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON

30:37.574 --> 30:38.973
THAT AT ALL.

30:39.042 --> 30:41.209
BUT YOU BUY A QUARTER

30:41.278 --> 30:42.643
OF THE WORLD'S COCOA BEANS.

30:42.712 --> 30:43.511
HOW CAN YOU NOT INFLUENCE THE

30:43.580 --> 30:44.679
PRICE?

30:44.748 --> 30:45.680
>> John: EXACTLY.

30:45.749 --> 30:47.915
AND LOOK, I'M NO ECONOMIST,

30:47.984 --> 30:48.983
DESPITE WINNING "MOST LIKELY TO

30:49.052 --> 30:49.650
BE AN ECONOMIST,

30:49.719 --> 30:51.252
BASED ON APPEARANCE" BACK IN

30:51.321 --> 30:53.354
PRESCHOOL.

30:53.423 --> 30:54.489
BUT IF YOU BUY THAT MUCH OF THE

30:54.558 --> 30:55.490
GLOBAL SUPPLY IN SOMETHING, YOU

30:55.559 --> 30:56.924
DEFINITELY HAVE SOME SWAY OVER

30:56.993 --> 30:59.660
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

30:59.729 --> 31:00.561
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

31:00.630 --> 31:01.295
MODELS HERE COMPANIES COULD LOOK

31:01.364 --> 31:02.563
TO.

31:02.632 --> 31:04.132
REMEMBER THAT DUTCH JOURNALIST

31:04.201 --> 31:05.133
MAKING THE GUY FROM

31:05.202 --> 31:06.834
NESTLE SQUIRM?

31:06.903 --> 31:07.735
AS A RESULT OF THAT SEGMENT, HE

31:07.804 --> 31:08.436
ACTUALLY CREATED HIS OWN

31:08.505 --> 31:09.804
CHOCOLATE COMPANY,

31:09.873 --> 31:11.873
TONY'S CHOCOLONELY.

31:11.942 --> 31:13.174
IT WORKS HARD TO ENSURE ITS

31:13.243 --> 31:14.809
SUPPLY CHAIN IS FREE FROM CHILD

31:14.878 --> 31:16.744
OR SLAVE LABOR.

31:16.813 --> 31:17.845
AND -- IMPORTANTLY -- ENSURES

31:17.914 --> 31:18.846
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO GROW ITS

31:18.915 --> 31:19.680
COCOA AREN'T IN

31:19.749 --> 31:21.015
DIRE POVERTY.

31:21.084 --> 31:22.550
HERE'S ITS FORMER HEAD OF

31:22.619 --> 31:23.651
SUSTAINABILITY, EXPLAINING HOW

31:23.720 --> 31:24.786
IT SETS THE PRICE FOR THE

31:24.855 --> 31:26.587
BEANS THAT IT BUYS.

31:26.656 --> 31:28.790
>> WE CALCULATE HOW

31:28.859 --> 31:29.423
BIG THE GAP IS BETWEEN WITH THE

31:29.492 --> 31:30.024
GOVERNMENT SET PRICE, AND THE

31:30.093 --> 31:31.559
LIVING INCOME PRICE, AND WE PAY

31:31.628 --> 31:34.395
THAT GAP AS AN EXTRA PREMIUM.

31:34.464 --> 31:36.030
>> FOR THE SPRING HARVEST THE

31:36.099 --> 31:37.965
PREMIUM WAS ABOUT $63 HIGHER

31:38.034 --> 31:39.467
THAN WHAT'S SET BY THE

31:39.536 --> 31:40.768
GOVERNMENT, MEANING TONY'S PAID

31:40.837 --> 31:41.369
ALMOST DOUBLE FOR EACH BAG OF

31:41.438 --> 31:43.838
BEANS.

31:43.907 --> 31:45.440
>> John: THAT'S GREAT.

31:45.509 --> 31:47.008
AND IT SAYS SOMETHING THAT

31:47.077 --> 31:48.376
TONY'S WERE SOMEHOW ABLE TO PAY

31:48.445 --> 31:49.977
FARMERS DOUBLE

31:50.046 --> 31:50.945
THE GOING RATE, DESPITE BEING A

31:51.014 --> 31:52.814
MID-SIZE DUTCH COCOA COMPANY

31:52.883 --> 31:54.081
WHOSE LOGO, BY THE WAY, LOOKS

31:54.150 --> 31:55.883
LIKE A CASUAL DINING RESTAURANT

31:55.952 --> 31:56.484
OPERATED BY-AND-FOR

31:56.553 --> 31:58.719
CLOWNS.

31:58.788 --> 32:01.155
IF THESE GUYS CAN DO IT, THERE'S

32:01.224 --> 32:03.157
FRANKLY NO REASON WHY THESE

32:03.226 --> 32:05.126
CAN'T AS WELL.

32:05.195 --> 32:05.927
AND TO BE FAIR, EVEN TONY'S OWN

32:05.996 --> 32:06.727
WEBSITE ADMITS THE SCALE OF THE

32:06.796 --> 32:08.029
CHALLENGE HERE,

32:08.098 --> 32:09.063
SAYING, "WE HAVE NEVER FOUND AN

32:09.132 --> 32:10.331
INSTANCE OF MODERN SLAVERY IN

32:10.400 --> 32:12.467
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, HOWEVER, WE DO

32:12.536 --> 32:14.168
NOT GUARANTEE OUR

32:14.237 --> 32:16.204
CHOCOLATE IS 100% SLAVE FREE.

32:16.273 --> 32:17.538
WHILE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE

32:17.607 --> 32:19.040
CAN TO PREVENT SLAVERY AND CHILD

32:19.109 --> 32:21.075
LABOR, WE ARE ALSO REALISTIC."

32:21.144 --> 32:22.743
AND I HAVE TO SAY, I APPRECIATE

32:22.812 --> 32:23.778
THAT --

32:23.847 --> 32:24.545
BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

32:24.614 --> 32:25.480
BETWEEN

32:25.549 --> 32:26.247
RECOGNIZING HOW MUCH THERE IS TO

32:26.316 --> 32:27.949
DO, AND SIMPLY NOT DOING ENOUGH.

32:28.018 --> 32:30.818
AND I KNOW THESE ARE COMPANIES,

32:30.887 --> 32:31.953
NOT CHARITIES, WHOSE JOB IT IS

32:32.022 --> 32:33.254
TO MAKE MONEY,

32:33.323 --> 32:34.455
NOT SAVE THE WORLD.

32:34.524 --> 32:35.990
BUT THAT MEANS THAT THEY'LL ONLY

32:36.059 --> 32:37.191
CARE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM EXACTLY

32:37.260 --> 32:39.160
AS MUCH AS THEY ARE FORCED TO.

32:39.229 --> 32:40.995
SO IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT

32:41.064 --> 32:42.830
GETTING CHILD LABOR OUT OF OUR

32:42.899 --> 32:43.998
CHOCOLATE, WE CAN'T

32:44.067 --> 32:46.567
KEEP RELYING ON PINKY PROMISES

32:46.636 --> 32:48.903
AND THE HONOR SYSTEM -- WE NEED

32:48.972 --> 32:50.037
TOUGH LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES

32:50.106 --> 32:52.106
COMPANIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

32:52.175 --> 32:53.274
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS THE

32:53.343 --> 32:54.609
ONLY INDUSTRY

32:54.678 --> 32:56.077
WHERE EXPLOITATION IN OTHER

32:56.146 --> 32:57.245
COUNTRIES IS THE NORM -- I COULD

32:57.314 --> 32:58.579
JUST AS EASILY HAVE

32:58.648 --> 32:59.347
DONE THIS PIECE ABOUT COFFEE, OR

32:59.416 --> 33:00.581
PALM OIL.

33:00.650 --> 33:03.317
AND WE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT

33:03.386 --> 33:03.918
TRAFFICKING AND CHILD LABOR IN

33:03.987 --> 33:06.087
THE US FARM SYSTEM THIS YEAR.

33:06.156 --> 33:07.622
BUT EXPERTS THEMSELVES SAY OF

33:07.691 --> 33:10.057
CHOCOLATE, IN FEW INDUSTRIES IS

33:10.126 --> 33:11.692
THE EVIDENCE OF OBJECTIONABLE

33:11.761 --> 33:12.860
PRACTICES SO CLEAR, THE

33:12.929 --> 33:14.896
INDUSTRY'S PLEDGES TO REFORM SO

33:14.965 --> 33:16.097
AMBITIOUS AND THE BREACHING OF

33:16.166 --> 33:18.366
THOSE PROMISES SO OBVIOUS.

33:18.435 --> 33:20.301
LOOK, WE'VE KNOWN FOR 20 YEARS

33:20.370 --> 33:22.370
WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE HERE, AND

33:22.439 --> 33:23.738
WE HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO FIX THEM.

33:23.807 --> 33:25.039
BUT IF WE DO, THEN IMAGINE THIS,

33:25.108 --> 33:27.141
ONE DAY, MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, WE

33:27.210 --> 33:28.743
CAN GET BACK TO A

33:28.812 --> 33:30.044
POINT WHERE CHOCOLATE CAN ONCE

33:30.113 --> 33:31.979
MORE GIVE US THE SIMPLE

33:32.048 --> 33:32.713
UNCOMPLICATED JOY OF

33:32.782 --> 33:39.187
THIS.

33:39.256 --> 33:39.587
>> John: EXACTLY.

33:39.656 --> 33:45.827
AND NOW THIS.

33:45.896 --> 33:47.929
>> Announcer: AND NOW, LOCAL

33:47.998 --> 33:48.563
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES GO ALL

33:48.632 --> 33:51.599
OUT WITH THEIR SAFETY PSA'S.

33:51.668 --> 33:53.034
>> HI, EVERYBODY.

33:53.103 --> 33:55.803
THIS IS CANINE SAM WITH SOME

33:55.872 --> 33:58.506
HALLOWEEN SAFETY TIPS.

33:58.575 --> 34:00.308
>> SOME SAFETY TIPS FOR THE

34:00.377 --> 34:05.246
UPCOMING HALLOWEEN.

34:05.315 --> 34:06.380
IT IS GOING TO BE ON

34:06.449 --> 34:06.714
OCTOBER 31ST.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.049
WE ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE FROM
