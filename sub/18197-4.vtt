00:16.040 --> 00:17.234
Lee.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.117
Ramona!

00:22.760 --> 00:24.273
Well, it's not that bad!

00:24.360 --> 00:26.078
Result if you like pink.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.673
Let's just hope Lee does.

00:28.880 --> 00:32.235
Why are you doing his washing anyway?
- Cos he no have a washing machine.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.710
No. Why are you doing his washing?
He could go to a launderette.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.870
What do you think he did
before you came along?

00:37.960 --> 00:39.871
His last girlfriend probably do it.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.394
Come on, it's nice to do things
for your man.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.357
Did you no do the washing for Mark?

00:44.440 --> 00:46.510
No, I did not!
- Hmm.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.238
And that is not why we split up.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.676
If you wanna be a doormat, it's up to you
but he's not taking advantage of me.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.433
No more sweaty pants
in my washing machine, OK?

00:56.240 --> 00:57.468
Look at that.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.351
Just swallow that. Open up.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.351
He's dead.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.555
No!

01:04.640 --> 01:06.073
Who?

01:06.160 --> 01:07.752
Mr McGarry, our landlord.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.478
Heart attack. Good night.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.395
Apparently, he owed a lot of people a lot of
money. It's why the house is up for auction.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.074
But what about us?
- Doesn't include contents.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.994
Auction's on the 12th, so people are gonna
start coming round to look at it soon.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.479
Oh, great!

01:22.560 --> 01:24.630
Aye, but, Rach, look, this is
an opportunity.

01:24.720 --> 01:29.032
We've been renting here for the last five years.
That's dead money. It's time we bought.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.712
Well, can we afford to?

01:30.800 --> 01:33.678
With two incomes? No.
But I'm sure we can manage.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.478
How much do you think it's worth?

01:35.560 --> 01:37.551
Agent reckons they'll get 250.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.789
No way.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.031
It's Didsbury, it's a popular place.
I live here.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.237
But it's only got two bedrooms.
- It'd be nicer to have three rooms.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.993
So we might have to move a bit further out.
Or Moss Side.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.719
But, you know, you get more for your money.
Bigger garden.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.917
What do we need a bigger garden for?
- Football.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.958
Barbecues.
Somewhere to pee when the loo's taken.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.158
Well, that's very nice. Peeing in the garden.
That's lovely. You've sold it to me.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.639
It beats the kitchen sink.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.278
I don't want to move.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.669
We like living here, don't we, sweetheart?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.829
Rachel...

02:10.919 --> 02:12.399
We can't afford it.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.790
It won't go for 250,000 pounds.
- We can't afford it!

02:15.880 --> 02:18.314
But we can afford somewhere else. Nicer.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.038
Of our own.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.791
<i>So she's not sold on the idea?</i>

02:23.880 --> 02:27.793
No! But soon we'll have no option.
We'll be out on the streets. On our arses.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.757
You'll talk her round, won't you?

02:29.840 --> 02:31.432
Always have done in the past.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.751
But that was simple stuff,
ex-girlfriends you were seeing on the quiet.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.913
This is something else. This is the fundamental
difference between the sexes.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.070
Any idea what he's on about?
- Not a clue.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.116
See, men are hunters, we don't care.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.316
We could live anywhere. In a cave.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.356
As long as there was a telly.

02:47.440 --> 02:52.036
But women bond with the home in
the same way that man bonds with his pint.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.473
That's mine, by the way.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.190
Ah! See? Women make homes their nests.
That's what they have drawers for everything.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.430
Do you know why they know
where everything is?

03:00.520 --> 03:03.080
Cos they put it there in the first place.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.470
Plus, I know where everything is.
- Yeah, but 250 grand.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.676
Yeah, well, that's bloody estate agent talk.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.432
Otherwise known as bullshit.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.670
I've done the maths, we can go up to 200.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.716
What if it goes higher?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.791
Well, then we'd be stuffed.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.995
I think even at 250, it's still a good buy.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.231
You think so?
- Hmm. Yeah, think about it.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.155
Right.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.310
Take what you're paying in rent...

03:28.400 --> 03:31.119
..over 25 years, allowing for inflation.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.589
How do you know what I'm paying in rent?

03:33.680 --> 03:36.478
You told me once. I don't forget figures.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.075
Compare that with a 90% mortgage
over the same period.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.672
OK, that doesn't work.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.194
Suppose then you have only a 50% mortgage.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.599
That wouldn't be enough.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.114
With the potential rental income,

03:51.200 --> 03:54.158
and a modest rise in property prices...

03:55.400 --> 03:57.118
Phew.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.191
Well, it beats the stock market.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.191
That's very helpful.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.236
Another drink?
- Yes, please.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.471
So, how are you going without Mark?

04:09.560 --> 04:11.232
I'm better off without him.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.392
That's what I keep telling myself.
Like a mantra.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.274
Well, I did meet this really nice guy
who works for...

04:18.360 --> 04:20.271
No, Jo, I am not interested. Sorry.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.672
If the most gorgeous man in the world pitched
up on the doorstep now, I wouldn't bat an eyelid.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.112
You should go.
- No, you go.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.918
Don't tempt me.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.833
I thought you'd sorted out
that immigration thing?

04:34.920 --> 04:38.708
Yeah, we have.
It's just Pete and I are still miles apart.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.155
We're sleeping in separate rooms.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.630
I don't know how to bridge the gap.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.834
Karen, can you get that, please?
- Yep.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.635
Hello.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.869
Hi.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.793
Och, isn't he just beautiful?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.354
Just like his mum.
- Sorry, can I help you?

05:05.440 --> 05:07.237
And you have a lovely house.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.754
Oh, the house. You'd better come in.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.955
OK, two bedrooms upstairs,
upstairs bathroom, kitchen...

05:19.040 --> 05:20.917
I haven't come about the house, Rachel.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.230
Oh, I'm not Rachel.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.756
I think we must have got
our wires crossed somewhere.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.478
Yeah, tangled more like.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.437
You must be Rachel, then?

05:30.520 --> 05:32.158
Um, no.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.917
Rachel?
- Yes?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.752
Third time lucky.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.717
I'm Bill.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.028
Bill?

05:41.120 --> 05:43.076
I'm the wee lad's granddad.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.116
Well, I take it that is Matthew?

05:49.280 --> 05:52.875
I just want me and Jo to be like we were
before we were married.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.916
You'd best get a divorce, then.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.549
You could send her flowers. I know a good
florist. Discount for repeat orders.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.349
Yeah, but flowers, it's such a cliche.
- Cook for her. Women love that.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.512
I could do! You know, I do a mean spag bol.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.630
Pete, if music be the food of love,

06:08.720 --> 06:11.314
spag bol is like a shag behind
the bike sheds.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.994
Use your imagination.
Or failing that, Jamie Oliver's.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.150
Do you really think flowers are a cliche?

06:18.960 --> 06:22.555
You're going from Dublin to Gothenburg
and you were just passing?

06:22.640 --> 06:25.074
Mm-hm. Overhead.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.038
No, I've business there.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.113
I thought it'd be a good opportunity
to see my grandson. And my son, of course.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.352
Will that be him?

06:36.440 --> 06:39.637
I'm drunk and I'm wanting sex!
- Yeah.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.075
One or all of you will do.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.871
Oh, sorry.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.518
Hello, Adam.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.152
What are you doing here?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.959
I came to meet Matthew,
of course. And Rachel.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.793
Get out.
- I was hoping we could talk.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.233
We just have.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.392
If you've had a drink, maybe this isn't
the time... - That was a joke!

07:05.480 --> 07:07.675
You mean, the part about sex wasn't?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.115
I want you to leave.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.074
Maybe we should.
I'm sure you've got a lot to discuss.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.071
I've nothing to say to him.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.676
Sorry to cause a scene.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.272
Nice...
- Just go!

07:30.440 --> 07:33.398
Maybe we should leave.
- Not on my account you don't have to.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.869
I don't know, maybe...
- Just do what you want to do!

07:35.960 --> 07:37.439
Let's go.
- Yeah, we'll go.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.999
It's OK.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.598
It's OK, it's OK.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.352
<i>Do you think we should stop?</i>

07:51.440 --> 07:52.714
Why?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.314
Well, because it's rude not to.
He might see us.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.152
No, he won't.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.473
Then again.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.714
Hello again.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.631
Hi. Do you want a lift somewhere?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.790
That's OK. I'll pick up a cab.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.108
Not round here you won't.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.351
That's a pity. There's a plane
I could catch.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.199
The airport.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.113
OK, hop in. We'll just drop Jo off.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.952
Thanks.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.956
How did he know about Matthew?

08:33.919 --> 08:34.989
Sorry?

08:36.039 --> 08:37.313
My dad.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.275
He said he'd come to see Matthew.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.191
OK. I wrote to him when Matthew was born.
- You did what?

08:47.600 --> 08:51.275
To tell him that he was a grandfather.
I thought he had the right to know.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.828
That's nice of you.
I don't see you inviting your dad.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.957
That's different, Adam.
Your dad didn't hit your mum.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.270
Anyway, I didn't invite him.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.793
You should still have told me.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.916
Well, I knew how you'd react.
- Yeah? How?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.399
Like this!
- Do you blame me?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.038
No, I don't, but...

09:06.120 --> 09:09.112
Honestly, if you could have seen your dad
with Matthew...

09:09.200 --> 09:10.997
I don't wanna talk about it, Rachel.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.835
Hey.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.638
Hi.
- What's going on?

09:36.720 --> 09:38.915
Well, now you're here...

09:39.000 --> 09:40.558
the pasta.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.949
I was going to do something a bit pukka.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.713
But, to be honest, it's out of a jar.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.350
It's a peace offering.
I just want us to be friends again.

09:50.440 --> 09:54.319
Oh, Pete, I'm sorry about the way
I've been behaving.

09:54.400 --> 09:58.837
It's just that the immigration thing
really freaked me out.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.353
What's that?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.914
Peace offering. Chinese.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.752
But we can throw it out.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.913
No. No, let's have the lot.
Let's have a gastronomic feast.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.673
All right. An Epicurean orgy.
- Hmm, sounds nice.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.432
But we'll do the washing-up first.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.150
I'm really sorry about this. I had
no idea the flight was going to be full.

10:21.240 --> 10:25.279
Well, you wouldn't, would you? Manchester
to Gothenburg. Who's gonna do that?

10:25.360 --> 10:28.318
The Scandinavian Youth Orchestra,
apparently.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.314
Look, I don't mind checking into a hotel.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.075
Nonsense. I have a spare room,
now my husband's no longer in it.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.271
Hello, Josh.
- Hello, Mummy.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.670
Josh, this is Bill. Bill, this is Josh.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.159
Hi, Josh.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.595
Come on. I'll show you your room.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.113
Come on, sweetheart.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.838
Oh!

10:59.720 --> 11:03.269
Well, hello. I thought we'd play
a little game.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.875
I'm going to be the naughty lodger
who can't pay her rent.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.873
And you are going to play the landlord
who's come to collect.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.352
Right! I like this game.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.913
OK.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.357
That'll be 85 pounds a week and
you put your bins out on Mondays. Ta-ra!

11:25.400 --> 11:26.549
Wait!

11:38.720 --> 11:41.075
No rogue jock straps in there, are there?

11:41.160 --> 11:43.390
Hmm?
- We're Lee-free?

11:43.480 --> 11:44.515
Oh!

11:44.600 --> 11:46.989
Yeah. He not very happy, though.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.310
He hate going to the laundry-ette.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.311
Oh, he'll get used to it.
- I doubt it.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.073
I go for him.
- Ramona!

11:55.960 --> 11:58.235
There's no flight today.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.074
Oh, well. It'll give you another chance
to make things up with Adam.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.875
Maybe you should try
the more indirect approach.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.033
Rachel?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.951
Well, she did write to you, didn't she?

12:11.040 --> 12:13.315
No, I don't want to put her
between me and him.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.311
Surely that's for her to decide?

12:15.400 --> 12:18.472
And please don't offend me
by offering to book into a hotel.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.152
It's chocolates this morning.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.152
Oh, God, what a cliche!

12:29.240 --> 12:31.390
Put 'em with the flowers.
- OK.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.436
Robyn Duff, please.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.475
Is that the same meeting as earlier?

12:41.080 --> 12:43.548
No, just that David Marsden called.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.040
Sally, if anyone calls, I'm in a meeting.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.471
<i>I thought it was better we met here.</i>

13:06.560 --> 13:09.870
Than risk a certain someone seeing us
together?

13:09.960 --> 13:13.350
I agreed to see you.
That doesn't mean I'm in your camp.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.279
I just think it'd be better if I had
a chance to talk to Adam, put my case.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.112
He doesn't want to hear it, Bill.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.917
And to be fair,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.911
I can understand why.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.319
Yes, but...

13:27.360 --> 13:29.157
..it's time he heard the full story.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.358
Mr Marsden!
Mr Marsden, you can't go in, she's in...

13:38.440 --> 13:40.908
What more do you want from me, Robyn?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.592
David!
- No, no! Hear me out.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.116
I have said I'm sorry. And I'll keep
saying it until you believe me.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.553
I am sorry!

13:47.640 --> 13:50.234
Mea culpa and all that. But please!

13:50.320 --> 13:53.357
You see, I've realised
how much you mean to me.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.194
We...you know, we could have
such fun together and...

13:57.280 --> 14:00.317
What's more, the sex is fantastic!

14:00.400 --> 14:02.072
David!

14:03.520 --> 14:04.919
Oh.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.589
Hello.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.628
I'm sorry.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.753
Again.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.636
I don't see the point of this.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.676
Not if we're bidding for our own house.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.638
Well, first, we might see
something we prefer.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.872
And second...

14:31.920 --> 14:33.876
..we can't afford our own house!

14:35.120 --> 14:36.394
Come on.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.829
How can I help you?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.354
We'd like to buy a house.
- We're just looking for now.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.953
Yeah...
- Anything in mind?

14:44.040 --> 14:46.190
Pretty easy, three bedrooms...
- Didsbury.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.838
Or thereabouts.
- Near the shops.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.797
But a nice, quiet neighbourhood.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.677
And what's our price?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.512
180.
- To 200.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.431
Is this Chas?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.235
Chas?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.993
Chas Mabbutt.
We're always winding each other up.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.152
This is a wind-up?

15:18.920 --> 15:20.035
Robyn!

15:20.120 --> 15:24.910
That, David, is a non-molestation order,
signed by a magistrate.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.390
You come within 500 yards of me
without my permission,

15:28.480 --> 15:30.550
I'm gonna hang you up to
dry by your bollocks.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.714
No buts.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.677
You're a pest, David.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.591
A nuisance to women.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.639
See you later.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.073
See you.
- See you.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.235
I'm really looking forward to this weekend.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.471
Really? Why?
- Birmingham. The new club opening.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.949
Oh, shit! I wonder if I can get out of it.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.598
What? It'll be fun.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.319
What, selling fitness
to a load of overweight Brummies?

16:15.400 --> 16:17.277
That's just during the day.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.636
There's a whole crowd of us going.
- I'd rather stay at home with Pete.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.836
They're putting us up in a great hotel.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.910
Oh, go on! It'll be a laugh.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.150
And they're paying double bubble.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.559
Really?

16:34.080 --> 16:35.991
Now, are you sure I didn't cost
you your job?

16:36.080 --> 16:38.196
Well, for a moment, I thought you had.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.435
But I think you rather did me a favour.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.353
Hmm?
- It's not a bad reputation to have.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.590
You're making me jealous already.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.034
So, are we officially an item now?

16:50.120 --> 16:52.429
How do you go about making it official?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.476
By telling your wife about me?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.357
I don't think that's a good idea.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.919
Maybe not.
- Hang on.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.511
The market in Didsbury's strong.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.311
You're thinking about moving?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.356
No, buying.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.148
Mmm! What are we having?

17:16.240 --> 17:17.798
Oh, a little bit of everything.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.473
Suits me. Have I got time for a shower?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.790
Oh, yeah. It not ready for at least an hour.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.518
Hello.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.319
Bazza! A drink? Yeah, hang on.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.789
Fancy a swift half with a mate of mine?

17:32.880 --> 17:35.348
Hello! I got the food on.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.716
Go on, then. You go.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.910
Yeah, OK. It'll have to be a quickie.
I'll see you there in ten.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.399
Thanks, love.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.755
I'll just show Mr and Mrs Barlow upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.476
7.99 pounds! Are we having guests?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.112
Yes.
- Who?

18:08.200 --> 18:12.113
Er, Simon. He's a work colleague,
new to Manchester.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.316
A nice bloke. Works on the Warbouys account.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.277
That'll be him, then.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.634
Yes, it will.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.317
Adam, everything I just said
was a lie. I'm sorry.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.555
Hmm?

18:40.480 --> 18:44.439
No, no, no, no.
Rachel, I can't believe you did this.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.239
Adam, I really think
you should listen to what he has to say.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.676
Weaselled your way round her, have you?
He always did have a way with women.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.239
I just wanna have a talk, son.

18:52.320 --> 18:56.472
Don't you call me son! You had the chance
years ago but you packed your bags and went.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.391
I was heartbroken!

18:58.480 --> 19:01.916
I wrote begging you to come back
or take me with you, but you didn't reply!

19:02.000 --> 19:04.036
I couldn't.
- You could have!

19:04.120 --> 19:06.918
Your mother wouldn't let me.
- Don't you dare try to blame her!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.558
I'm not, it's just...

19:08.640 --> 19:10.119
Your mother...

19:10.200 --> 19:12.156
I don't want to hear it!

19:15.520 --> 19:17.476
Whatever you've been told...

19:18.520 --> 19:21.273
..I did not leave your mother for
another woman.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.509
That's what she said.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.392
I don't believe you.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.236
It was a man.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.556
And this is the kitchen.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.113
What?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.873
I left your mother because of another man.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.115
I left Ireland altogether, in fact.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.748
It wasn't easy.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.517
We'll be off.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.596
You're gay?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.668
Bisexual.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.878
It's all pretty academic, really.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.273
No.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.876
This changes nothing.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.554
You rejected me when I needed you most.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.349
I don't care what your excuse is.
There's no excuse for that.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.833
I know.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.472
I'm going out.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.952
Well, it's certainly easier than coming out.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.598
Your dad's gay?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.517
Blimey!

20:39.600 --> 20:40.794
What?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.596
What?
- Your dad.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.591
Gay.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.033
Yeah, it's hysterical.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.429
Oh, come on, Adam,
you've got to see the funny side.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.476
What funny side is that exactly?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.236
OK, I'm sorry.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.557
Look, I don't give a shite
whether my dad was gay or not.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.313
The point is, he walked out.
- For another man.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.789
They went abroad because of bigots like you.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.677
Hey, hey.
- Have you any idea

21:05.760 --> 21:08.479
how hard it must have been
to be gay in Belfast in the '70s?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.278
Both sides gunning for you.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.713
Literally.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.788
I'm sorry.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.836
Yeah, so am I.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.797
<i>One message. First new message.</i>

21:28.880 --> 21:32.236
<i>Karen, hi.
The court needs our marriage certificate.</i>

21:32.320 --> 21:34.993
<i>So, can you get it to my solicitor's?
It's fairly urgent.</i>

21:35.080 --> 21:36.877
<i>Call me if there's any problem. Bye.</i>

22:15.200 --> 22:16.633
Is Jo in?

22:16.720 --> 22:18.153
Er...no.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.512
He's been shagging her all along.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.516
Did I mention Jo wasn't in?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.670
I feel like such an idiot.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.312
She shouldn't be long.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.038
Her, of all people!

22:33.120 --> 22:35.680
She tried to paint me as an unfit mother!

22:37.560 --> 22:40.279
Would you like a coffee?
- I mean, listen...

22:40.360 --> 22:44.751
He's free to see whoever he wants,
that's fine, but really! His divorce lawyer?

22:45.680 --> 22:46.954
Are you sure?

22:47.040 --> 22:50.350
Of course I'm sure! I saw them in
the street! She kissed him on the lips.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.118
Maybe he's paying her too well.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.478
Well, does it really matter?
- Of course it matters!

22:57.560 --> 22:59.073
Why?

22:59.160 --> 23:02.391
You said yourself that you're both
free agents. You just don't like her.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.756
And I don't blame you.
But that's your problem, not David's.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.110
I thought you were making coffee.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.271
I must go to the gym more often.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.237
I quite like you the way you are.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.158
Yeah, I can understand that.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.917
Oh, shit, who's that?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.473
That's Karen.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.755
It might be something to do
with the children.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.279
Karen, hi.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.713
David.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.279
Are you OK?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.554
Yeah, fine.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.790
You sound out of breath.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.916
No, I'm at the gym.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.479
The gym? I thought you'd given all that up?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.074
I had to start again, you know. Needed to.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.038
Look, was there a reason you called?

24:02.120 --> 24:04.076
Yeah. Um...

24:04.160 --> 24:07.197
I just wanted to say that
I know about you and Robyn.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.998
You do?

24:09.080 --> 24:11.116
Yeah, and I'm fine with it.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.789
You are?

24:15.400 --> 24:17.356
Well, trying to be, yeah.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.796
David?

24:24.680 --> 24:26.671
Yeah, sorry...I just tweaked something.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.232
Right, well, I just wanted to say
that I know about you and Robyn.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.197
I'm fine with it and um...

24:37.280 --> 24:39.236
I hope you're both very happy.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.437
Yeah, OK, thanks, Karen.
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.597
OK. Bye.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.715
Bye.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.360
Oh! You are so...

24:52.120 --> 24:55.157
I think I just interrupted David having sex.

24:59.880 --> 25:03.668
Do these estate agents ever turn up
when they say they're going to?

25:10.880 --> 25:12.711
Keano!

25:13.760 --> 25:15.716
All right, luv?
- Hi.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.959
Are you up yet, you slag?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.670
This is definitely the best you've shown us.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.230
The kitchen's nice, the bedrooms
are a good size, I can't really see...

25:30.120 --> 25:32.076
..that there's anything wrong with it.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.515
Near the airport, too, which is handy.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.637
We're thinking of moving in here.
- Oh. You'll like it here.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.915
Yeah, it's a lovely area. Very safe.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.116
That's because Jesus protects us.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.270
Are you friends with the Lord?

25:52.040 --> 25:53.359
<i>Have you found it yet?</i>

25:53.440 --> 25:56.079
<i>I have to sort the map out.
Oh, yeah, I've got it.</i>

25:56.160 --> 25:59.277
<i>It's just off Park Street.</i>

25:59.360 --> 26:01.669
<i>Oh, God...
- What?</i>

26:01.760 --> 26:03.352
<i>Right next to the prison.</i>

26:06.600 --> 26:08.556
<i>This is hopeless.</i>

26:10.960 --> 26:13.155
We're never going to find anywhere.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.196
And now time's running out.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.509
Maybe we're just going to
have to rent again.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.479
Maybe not.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.630
It's got to be worth a look.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.073
Oh...

26:31.120 --> 26:34.795
This house was sold.
Fell through at the last minute.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.916
It won't be on the market for long.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.228
What about schools?

26:38.320 --> 26:41.676
St Luke's up the road and
Butter Lane Primary about a mile away,

26:41.760 --> 26:44.069
both with excellent academic records.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.351
I'll leave you to it, then.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.069
Have a chat, and if you need me,
I'll be in the sales office round the corner.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.037
Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.076
Well, hoo hoo! What do you think?

26:56.160 --> 26:59.311
I think it's incredible.
- I know! To think that we can afford it.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.914
To think that people want to live here.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.558
Lots of people would.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.200
Adam, I'd rather live next door
to those Christians.

27:06.280 --> 27:10.398
Rachel! It has everything we've been looking
for. We're not gonna do better than this.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.872
I think we should keep looking.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.038
Well... You heard her.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.556
It's not gonna be on the market for long.
We're lucky we saw it.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.790
It all seems in pretty good order.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.953
I wouldn't be living here myself.
It's more of an investment opportunity.

27:27.040 --> 27:31.079
Well, I can't see you having any problems
getting permission for a loft conversion.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.510
I thought you said the occupants were out?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.875
Don't worry, they're lovely people.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.712
I know.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.278
Look, you don't know me, OK?
- Sorry?

27:47.360 --> 27:48.509
Adam!

27:48.600 --> 27:50.556
Rachel.
- Hello, David.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.835
Paul. What brings you here?

27:52.920 --> 27:55.229
I was just passing and thought I'd drop by.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.675
This chap was already here
and he kindly let me in.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.671
Waiting for a viewing.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.716
But they haven't shown.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.236
Oh, I have another appointment,
so I'll be off.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.072
Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.190
You fancy a coffee, then?

28:10.280 --> 28:11.429
I'd love one.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.158
Come on, then.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.430
Right.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.510
The kids are in bed. I'll put supper on.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.556
Taken care of.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.870
An Irish delicacy.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.871
Not potatoes, is it?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.394
Well, they might be involved.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.157
I just wanted to say thanks for
putting me up.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.834
You're not thinking of going?

28:37.920 --> 28:40.718
Karen, there's not much point in hanging on.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.836
Adam's not going to come round.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.318
Oh, that be Lee. I see you tomorrow. Bye.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.469
Bye.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.636
I've just been living in false hope.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.710
I'm sorry.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.596
It's fair enough.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.150
I can hardly forgive myself for walking out.
I don't see why he should.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.714
You're a stubborn lot, you Williamses.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.234
Well, that's something we have in common.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.910
Can I ask you something?

29:19.000 --> 29:22.117
I'm guessing this has nothing to do
with the meal.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.912
Bisexuality?

29:27.920 --> 29:32.311
I've never been sure.
Is it like...everyone's fair game?

29:32.400 --> 29:34.152
Well, not the ugly ones.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.636
No, it's the person.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.397
Not what sex they are.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.355
If they're attractive, they're attractive.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.516
And what's attractive?

29:49.600 --> 29:50.715
Well...

29:51.560 --> 29:53.039
..you have to ask?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.113
Sorry.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.355
Flirting's always been a weakness.

30:00.440 --> 30:04.513
Then you and Adam have got a lot more
in common than he'd like to admit.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.713
Still leaving me, then?

30:12.800 --> 30:15.917
You can always come with me.
- A sales rep hotel in Birmingham?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.399
I think I'll pass.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.232
I'll miss you.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.912
I doubt it.
- I will.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.632
Thank you.
- Thank you.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.198
Wine?
- Mmm. Please.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.157
Have you any plans for this afternoon?

30:34.240 --> 30:37.789
No. Nothing much on.
Why? Did you have something in mind?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.108
Mm-hm.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.839
It involves you having nothing much on.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.036
There's no stopping you, is there?

30:48.360 --> 30:50.635
I really like this place, don't you?

30:50.720 --> 30:53.871
Yeah. Good food, great wine,
my kind of place.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.474
But it's got a great atmosphere as well.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.028
Good place to bring friends.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.511
Then why don't you?

31:02.600 --> 31:05.398
What?
- Why don't you invite your friends here?

31:05.480 --> 31:06.754
Huh?

31:06.840 --> 31:09.070
It's about time I met them, don't you think?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.718
Yeah.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.870
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, dinner.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.678
Yeah, I'll ring round.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.398
You'd better warn Karen.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.438
We don't want her to think I'm trying
to steal them from her, do we?

31:21.480 --> 31:22.833
No.

31:25.080 --> 31:28.038
OK, so the first thing you need to do
is sort out...

31:28.120 --> 31:30.395
Right, so that's
your temporary membership card.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.392
I'll look forward to seeing you
down here soon. - OK, thanks.

31:34.560 --> 31:39.076
Minibus leaves for the hotel in half an hour.
- Oh, great. Not a minute too soon.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.875
The bedrooms aren't enormous, but...

31:42.960 --> 31:46.669
Once you've got a bed and a wardrobe in,
what else do you need?

31:46.760 --> 31:47.954
Hi, Karen.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.508
Oh, hi, Adam.
Rachel's just showing me your new house.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.874
It's great, isn't it?

31:53.280 --> 31:54.759
I'll go.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.071
You know, your dad's really upset?

32:05.360 --> 32:07.476
Still making him welcome, are you?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.836
Not for much longer, no,
he's leaving tomorrow.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.114
Good.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.599
Isn't there anything you want to say to him?

32:17.640 --> 32:19.278
Oh, yes.

32:19.360 --> 32:22.318
There's 20 years' worth.
I would like to have said it to him then.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.153
But, oh, yeah, I couldn't. That's the point!

32:26.480 --> 32:29.790
Right, so you're going to carry this anger
round with you all your life?

32:29.880 --> 32:31.836
What about Matthew?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.149
Matthew?

32:35.120 --> 32:38.078
You didn't have a father,
so he doesn't have a grandfather?

32:38.160 --> 32:40.196
Oh, come on! It is hardly the same.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.076
Just have a drink with him.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.957
One drink, Adam.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.599
Trust me. If you don't, you'll live
to regret it.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.516
He's in The Nag's Head.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.232
Where's Adam?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.276
The pub.
- Oh, great!

33:23.360 --> 33:25.316
To meet Bill.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.916
OK, hotel bar, ten minutes.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.911
What about our room?
- Easy, tiger.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.878
No, we brought some booze.
It's a lot cheaper.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.791
Your room, ten minutes.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.955
Adam.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.598
I'm staying for one drink,
and one drink only.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.315
I grew up hating you.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.038
I still do.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.077
I mean, what kind of father
walks out on his child?

34:20.960 --> 34:22.678
Every blrthday,

34:22.760 --> 34:26.355
every Christmas, every time
I passed my exams,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.873
I kept thinking,
''This year, maybe this year.''

34:30.920 --> 34:32.989
You're meant to enjoy those days.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.036
I hated them,

34:35.120 --> 34:37.076
cos they brought it home.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.956
All the lovely presents.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.310
But the one that was missing
was the only one I wanted.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.315
Didn't matter what it was.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.594
Just to have written on it,

34:50.679 --> 34:52.636
''From your daddy. ''

35:03.080 --> 35:05.036
What are you having?

35:07.280 --> 35:09.236
Are you staying for another?

35:09.320 --> 35:11.436
I haven't finished yet.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.836
How long has it been now?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.478
About an hour and ten minutes.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.074
It's a good sign, isn't it?
Isn't that a good sign?

35:29.320 --> 35:31.959
Well, if they're talking,
they're not fighting.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.196
Unless they are fighting.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.475
I didn't come out as such.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.357
Your mother found out.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.158
And no-one else knew.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.276
It was Ireland after all.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.875
She must have felt very humiliated.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.798
She didn't want to have anything
to do with me.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.109
Or me to have anything to do with you.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.156
She made me promise.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.958
And I'm not blaming her.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.512
I mean, I did shame her.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.274
But...

36:12.360 --> 36:14.954
don't you think I wasn't thinking of you?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.956
Every Christmas.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.871
Every birthday.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.239
Every day.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.276
I wrote you so many letters.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.755
I just never sent them.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.438
Come on!
- Nice one!

36:48.200 --> 36:51.317
Come on!
- Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

36:51.400 --> 36:53.072
Drink! Drink! Drink!

36:54.440 --> 36:55.668
Yeah!

36:58.520 --> 37:00.715
I lived in New York for a couple of years.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.199
When?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.554
Mid-'90s.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.279
Me and Pete went to New York in '94.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.032
I was there then.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.678
No?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.716
Well, it's a big city, Adam.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.429
We stayed in a dive near, um...

37:17.640 --> 37:19.312
..Union Square.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.631
My apartment was only
three blocks from there.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.790
No?
- Hm.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.792
Maybe we passed each other in the street.
- Yeah.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.913
It must be odd, having a gay dad.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.479
He's bisexual.

37:35.560 --> 37:38.154
Yeah, whatever that means.
- It means he can fancy women,

37:38.240 --> 37:40.196
and women can fancy him.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.599
No?

37:48.680 --> 37:50.159
No, you don't?

37:50.240 --> 37:55.314
My God, Karen, he's old enough
to be your father. Your gay father.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.675
I know. There's something about him.

37:59.960 --> 38:03.509
What? The key ring he wears
dangling from his waist?

38:04.960 --> 38:08.077
No! It's like with older men,
what you see is what you get.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.991
There are less pretensions.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.672
It's like he's beyond all that.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.756
Past it, more like.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.670
Your friend Karen's a fine-looking woman.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.318
Yeah, she's all right.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.994
She could do with minding her business
a bit more.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.718
Don't shoot the messenger.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.677
You know she's getting divorced?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.273
Aye, so she was telling me.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.791
She's very attractive!

38:35.880 --> 38:37.393
Yeah, yeah, she is.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.712
You're not serious?

38:41.800 --> 38:43.119
What?

38:43.200 --> 38:44.838
Are you swinging back again?

38:44.920 --> 38:46.478
Adam, I did that long ago.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.232
Back and forth.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.676
But Karen, she's half your age.
- I'm not that old.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.990
She's not that young.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.832
I haven't made a pass or anything.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.155
I'm just saying she's very attractive.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.116
Do you think I stand a chance?

39:04.240 --> 39:05.468
No!

39:15.680 --> 39:17.636
Drink! Drink!

39:17.720 --> 39:20.951
Get this down you in one go.
- Go on. Go on.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.235
And an article of clothing.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.470
All right but I get to choose what it is.

39:26.560 --> 39:30.997
OK, the article of clothing
I choose to take off is...

39:31.080 --> 39:32.354
Lee's shirt.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.237
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:34.320 --> 39:35.594
Cheat!

39:35.680 --> 39:37.636
Off! Off! Off!

39:38.680 --> 39:40.636
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

39:43.720 --> 39:45.676
I should be getting home.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.194
Mmm, I don't think I'll wait up.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.156
Thanks, Karen.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.753
What for?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.557
I'm so glad you came tonight.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.676
Do you have to leave tomorrow?

40:04.760 --> 40:05.795
No.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.711
I could stay longer.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.037
I am sorry, son.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.348
I know, Dad.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.353
I love you.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.719
Bloody poofs!

40:43.320 --> 40:45.709
Come on! Yeah-hey!

40:55.480 --> 40:57.436
Piggyback fight!

41:01.920 --> 41:05.435
Come on, boys! Off! Off! Off!

41:09.160 --> 41:10.593
Yay!

41:23.200 --> 41:25.191
OK if I have our room tonight, Jo?

41:25.280 --> 41:27.236
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.310
Looks like it's you and me, kid.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.355
Yeah. You, me and Jack.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.951
Hello. Everything all right?

42:05.040 --> 42:06.792
No, it's not all right.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.110
Karen, I really need to talk to you.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.999
I thought you and Pete were all right now.
- We are, that's the stupid thing, you know.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.913
Everything's fine. And then, this happens.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.956
Who was he?

42:21.040 --> 42:23.838
Oh, it was just this guy at the hotel.

42:24.920 --> 42:29.232
We were all sitting around drinking
and one thing led to another.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.072
That's quite a leap.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.355
Well, it was quite a lot of drink.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.436
Are you going to tell Pete?

42:37.520 --> 42:38.555
No.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.912
God, I don't know.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.157
Maybe I should. What do you think?

42:47.240 --> 42:50.198
I can't tell you what to do, Jo.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.556
I mean, it was just drink.
It's not like I felt anything for the guy.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.835
Are you going to see him again?

42:55.920 --> 42:57.876
No! I love Pete.

42:59.360 --> 43:00.759
This was just madness.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.758
Oh, my God. Am I in the right flat?

43:09.840 --> 43:12.798
I just thought it would be a nice surprise,
you know?

43:12.880 --> 43:15.394
Surprise? It's a bloody miracle.

43:16.200 --> 43:20.113
You do realise I won't be able to find anything
now you've restored order to my chaos.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.998
Well, you'll just have to ask me, won't you?
I'll know.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.798
I'll need you to be here, then, won't I?

43:24.880 --> 43:27.440
But I am here.
- Not all the time.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.596
Move in with me.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.189
Lee!

43:34.280 --> 43:36.032
Do you mean that?
- Yeah.

43:38.760 --> 43:39.954
Jo?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.035
Hey!
- Hi!

43:45.880 --> 43:48.110
I missed you.
- You should go away more often.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.270
No way. Not without you.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.675
OK. That is them all.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.389
I'll wait for you in the car.
- OK.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.036
I knew this day would come.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.315
As a parent, you prepare yourself.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.713
Oh, Karen, you know this not
change anything.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.519
I still be here every day, seven o'clock.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.388
Ramona, you've lived upstairs for five years
and I've never once seen you at seven.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.358
Mmm. OK, maybe eight.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.873
Ish.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.996
Listen, the point is that I'm still here
for you and the children.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.036
Are you sure about this? About Lee?

44:30.120 --> 44:31.997
Yeah.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.230
Well, I hope it works out.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.470
Oh! Oh, thank you.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.155
I see you tomorrow.
- Eight o'clock.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.151
Ish.
- Mm-hm.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.793
Oh, you, come here. Be good.

44:54.040 --> 44:54.995
Hello?

44:55.080 --> 44:56.718
Hi. Hi, it's me.

44:56.800 --> 45:02.955
I'm just calling...er cos...Robyn and I
are organising dinner at Hinchley's restaurant

45:03.040 --> 45:05.190
for...our friends.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.875
Our friends?

45:08.960 --> 45:12.635
Yeah. I'd like them to meet Robyn.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.109
Oh, that's nice. When?

45:15.200 --> 45:17.031
We thought Tuesday.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.758
Mmm, Tuesday would be fine.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.193
Are you OK with that?

45:20.280 --> 45:22.589
I'm sure Ramona will be able to baby-sit.
What time?

45:22.680 --> 45:25.148
You're wanting to come?

45:25.240 --> 45:27.196
Well, isn't that why you were phoning?

45:28.600 --> 45:31.239
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course, you'd be very welcome.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.392
David, I'm teasing.
I don't think Robyn would want me there.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.278
No, no, I'm sure she'd be delighted.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.316
Have a nice time, David.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.239
That was nice.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.514
So's this.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.516
Do you think I should come off the Pill?

46:00.920 --> 46:03.150
Do you want to?

46:03.240 --> 46:06.073
Yeah.
- Blimey.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.915
I just thought it'd be nice, you know.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.193
You, me...

46:12.280 --> 46:14.111
And Baby Algernon.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.997
Well, hopefully, a girl.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.354
Either way.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.839
A family.
