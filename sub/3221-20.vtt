WEBVTT

00:04.140 --> 00:05.840
We're gonna find a way
to beat the devil.

00:06.275 --> 00:09.375
What if you guys lead the devil
to the edge and I jump in?

00:09.979 --> 00:11.289
Yes.

00:12.148 --> 00:14.258
Sammy's long gone.

00:15.818 --> 00:16.898
What are you gonna do now?

00:17.219 --> 00:19.439
- Return to heaven, I suppose.
- Heaven?

00:19.922 --> 00:21.822
With Michael in the cage,
it's anarchy there.

00:22.291 --> 00:23.691
You're the new sheriff in town?

00:24.093 --> 00:25.963
It's civil war up there.

00:26.395 --> 00:28.415
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this.

00:28.898 --> 00:33.088
When the oil burns, no angel can touch
or pass through the flames or he dies.

00:35.604 --> 00:37.414
It's his soul. It's gone.

00:37.873 --> 00:40.973
When we freaks die, where do we go?
Not heaven, not hell.

00:41.577 --> 00:42.887
- Purgatory.
- And I want it.

00:43.379 --> 00:47.159
A human soul is more valuable
than you can imagine.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.050
This is about the souls.

00:49.385 --> 00:53.695
That angel went and created 50,000
new souls for your war machine.

00:54.457 --> 00:57.207
Eve, the mother of all.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.460
It's Crowley I want dead.

00:59.862 --> 01:02.642
Well, you're too late there.
That little mook roasted months ago.

01:03.199 --> 01:04.629
Crowley's alive.

01:07.370 --> 01:10.060
Really, Cass, this is getting ridiculous.

01:11.207 --> 01:14.017
How many times am I gonna have
to clean up your messes?

01:26.889 --> 01:31.929
You know, I've been here
for a very long time.

01:38.067 --> 01:40.287
I remember many things.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.860
<i>I remember being at a shoreline...</i>

01:44.373 --> 01:48.593
<i>watching a little gray fish
heave itself up on the beach.</i>

01:49.378 --> 01:53.598
<i>And an older brother saying,
"Don't step on that fish, Castiel.</i>

01:54.383 --> 01:56.603
<i>Big plans for that fish."</i>

01:57.386 --> 01:59.666
<i>I remember the Tower of Babel.</i>

02:00.389 --> 02:04.019
<i>All 37 feet of it which, I suppose,
was impressive at the time.</i>

02:04.693 --> 02:08.413
<i>And when it fell,
they howled "Divine wrath."</i>

02:09.098 --> 02:12.938
<i>But, come on, dried dung
can only be stacked so high.</i>

02:13.803 --> 02:17.283
<i>I remember Cain and Abel,
David and Goliath...</i>

02:18.607 --> 02:20.827
<i>Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

02:24.313 --> 02:27.213
<i>And, of course, I remember
the most remarkable event.</i>

02:28.818 --> 02:32.358
<i>Remarkable because it never
came to pass.</i>

02:33.522 --> 02:37.882
<i>It was averted by two boys,
an old drunk...</i>

02:38.661 --> 02:42.761
<i>and a fallen angel. The grand story.</i>

02:44.200 --> 02:46.220
<i>And we ripped up the ending...</i>

02:46.669 --> 02:49.709
<i>and the rules and destiny.</i>

02:50.639 --> 02:54.099
<i>Leaving nothing
but freedom and choice.</i>

02:57.379 --> 03:00.399
<i>Which is all well and good, except...</i>

03:03.752 --> 03:05.802
But what if I've made
the wrong choice?

03:06.255 --> 03:09.095
I mean, how am I supposed to know?

03:11.227 --> 03:13.187
I'm getting ahead of myself.

03:15.531 --> 03:17.841
Let me tell you my story.

03:22.104 --> 03:24.184
Let me tell you everything.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.280
Hello, Dean.

03:49.598 --> 03:52.118
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm...

03:52.635 --> 03:54.505
I'm fine. How about you?

03:55.604 --> 03:58.184
Just wanted to check in.

03:58.707 --> 04:01.987
So any word on Satan Jr. being alive?

04:03.379 --> 04:05.489
I'm looking, believe me.

04:06.248 --> 04:08.858
I just don't understand
how Crowley could've tricked me.

04:10.419 --> 04:12.909
Well, he's a tricky son of a bitch,
that's how.

04:13.789 --> 04:14.959
Doesn't matter.

04:16.058 --> 04:17.368
But if he is up and kicking...

04:18.226 --> 04:20.716
then what does matter
is finding him...

04:21.230 --> 04:23.370
ripping his head off,
and shoving it up his ass.

04:26.669 --> 04:29.539
What about you?
Have you found anything?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.570
No, nothing yet.

04:34.977 --> 04:36.557
Where's Sam?

04:37.313 --> 04:38.483
He's keeping busy.

04:38.814 --> 04:41.424
He's tracking a jinn in Omaha
as we speak.

04:41.951 --> 04:44.201
I'm headed out there right now
to meet up with him.

04:44.687 --> 04:48.087
- I'd come if I could.
- Yeah. No, I get it. No worries.

04:50.059 --> 04:52.169
But, Cass, you'll call, right?

04:53.629 --> 04:55.529
If you get into real trouble?

05:16.986 --> 05:18.326
Howdy, partner.

05:18.687 --> 05:21.647
- What've you found?
- Found a lot of things.

05:22.224 --> 05:25.794
For example, Eve's brain,
dead as a tin kipper.

05:26.462 --> 05:27.572
And yet...

05:29.665 --> 05:32.355
for some reason,
she keeps laying eggs.

05:37.406 --> 05:38.896
Watch this.

05:53.822 --> 05:56.102
- Chocula feels every tickle.
- What is that good for?

05:56.625 --> 05:58.585
Apart from the erotic value,
you got me.

05:59.028 --> 06:01.658
You said Eve could open
the door to purgatory.

06:02.197 --> 06:03.567
Correct. I did.

06:03.932 --> 06:06.802
And I'm confident that she could have
if she was still alive!

06:07.636 --> 06:10.446
Best chance to get over the rainbow
and the Winchesters killed her.

06:11.006 --> 06:14.026
- It was unavoidable.
- You screwed up, Cass.

06:14.643 --> 06:18.653
You let the hounds mangle the pheasant
and now I am up to my elbows in it.

06:19.381 --> 06:20.691
What is your point?

06:21.050 --> 06:24.090
The point is you're distracted
and that makes me nervous.

06:24.687 --> 06:26.937
I am holding up my end.

06:27.723 --> 06:28.923
Ah, yes.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.688
But is that all you're holding, huh?

06:32.761 --> 06:34.191
See...

06:35.230 --> 06:38.710
the stench of that Impala's
all over your overcoat, angel.

06:41.704 --> 06:44.104
I thought we'd agreed.
No more nights out with the boys.

06:44.606 --> 06:47.386
I spoke with Dean.
I needed to know what they know.

06:48.677 --> 06:52.457
About what? About me, maybe? Because
I happen to have it on good authority...

06:53.182 --> 06:56.462
that your two little pets
are currently trying to hunt me down!

06:58.887 --> 07:00.117
Forgive me...

07:00.456 --> 07:03.766
but I think you might have
a little conflict of interest here.

07:07.663 --> 07:09.003
<i>Crowley had a point, of course.</i>

07:10.265 --> 07:12.435
<i>My interest was conflicted.</i>

07:12.901 --> 07:15.891
<i>I still considered myself
the Winchesters' guardian.</i>

07:16.472 --> 07:19.342
<i>After all, they taught me
how to stand up.</i>

07:19.908 --> 07:21.808
Hey, ass butt.

07:27.349 --> 07:28.639
<i>What to stand for...</i>

07:29.518 --> 07:31.948
<i>and what generally happens to you
when you do.</i>

07:38.494 --> 07:40.134
<i>I was done.</i>

07:41.463 --> 07:43.193
<i>I was over.</i>

07:44.032 --> 07:46.932
<i>And then
the most extraordinary thing happened.</i>

07:49.938 --> 07:51.518
<i>I was put back.</i>

07:55.477 --> 07:56.677
<i>And we had won.</i>

07:57.346 --> 07:59.276
<i>We stopped Armageddon...</i>

08:02.017 --> 08:04.097
<i>but at a terrible cost.</i>

08:08.323 --> 08:11.543
<i>And so I knew what I had to do next.</i>

08:19.468 --> 08:23.888
<i>Once again, I went to harrow hell
to free Sam from Lucifer's cage.</i>

08:25.874 --> 08:28.064
<i>It was nearly impossible...</i>

08:28.544 --> 08:32.174
<i>but I was so full of confidence,
of mission.</i>

08:32.847 --> 08:37.648
<i>I see now that was arrogance, hubris.</i>

08:38.486 --> 08:41.006
<i>Because I hadn't truly raised Sam,
not all of him.</i>

08:56.572 --> 09:00.492
<i>Sometimes we're lucky enough
to be given a warning.</i>

09:01.710 --> 09:03.610
<i>This should've been mine.</i>

09:08.717 --> 09:10.177
Please.

09:10.819 --> 09:12.549
I'm begging you, Castiel.

09:12.955 --> 09:14.795
- Just kill the Winchesters.
- No.

09:15.224 --> 09:18.474
- Fine. Then I'll do it myself.
- If you kill them, I'll bring them back.

09:19.094 --> 09:21.144
No, you won't. Not where I'll put them.
Trust me.

09:21.597 --> 09:23.467
I said no.

09:26.602 --> 09:28.912
- Don't worry about them.
- Don't worry about...

09:29.404 --> 09:32.064
What, like Lucifer didn't worry?
Or Michael?

09:32.608 --> 09:35.628
Or Lilith or Alastair
or Azazel didn't worry?

09:36.211 --> 09:37.701
Am I the only piece on the board...

09:38.080 --> 09:41.560
who doesn't underestimate
those denim-wrapped nightmares?

09:43.485 --> 09:45.325
Just find purgatory.

09:45.754 --> 09:47.974
If you don't, we will both die.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.387
Again and again,
until the end of time.

09:55.631 --> 09:57.911
The Winchesters won't get to you.

09:59.401 --> 10:01.071
Let them get to me.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.640
I'll tear their frigging hearts out!

10:12.514 --> 10:14.244
Gotta tell you, Redd.

10:14.650 --> 10:17.310
For a filthy,
lower-than-snake-spit hell spawn...

10:17.886 --> 10:20.546
you seem to turn yourself
into a damn fine hunter.

10:21.089 --> 10:23.279
I don't know whether to kill you
or kiss you.

10:24.993 --> 10:26.773
Oh, please kill me.

10:27.329 --> 10:30.549
That was you that dug out that nest of
vamps back in Swan Valley, wasn't it?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.596
That was nice work.

10:32.968 --> 10:35.718
Eight of them on one go,
roped and tied.

10:36.271 --> 10:38.461
And then you brought them
to Crowley, right?

10:38.941 --> 10:41.111
Read the papers, redneck.

10:42.110 --> 10:43.250
The king is dead.

10:49.985 --> 10:51.065
Crowley's alive.

10:52.487 --> 10:55.887
You prove it just by being,
you poor, dumb jackass.

10:58.126 --> 11:01.196
Crowley's alive, his nets are still out.

11:01.797 --> 11:04.427
Except now he's using you schmucks
to hunt his monsters.

11:06.034 --> 11:07.294
Up yours.

11:26.021 --> 11:27.191
Redd?

11:28.890 --> 11:30.590
Where's Crowley?

11:32.594 --> 11:34.554
No? Nothing?

11:36.231 --> 11:37.221
Oh, okay, then.

11:38.233 --> 11:39.633
Here, hang on to this for a bit.

11:50.779 --> 11:53.179
- So, what'd you tell him?
- Nothing. Just relax.

11:53.682 --> 11:54.642
What's the hubbub?

11:54.983 --> 11:57.413
Saw Cass. He popped in on me
about two hours back.

11:58.253 --> 11:59.803
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing.

12:00.188 --> 12:01.738
Told him we were
on some monster hunt.

12:02.124 --> 12:04.314
He doesn't know
that we're getting close to Crowley.

12:06.795 --> 12:09.985
You know, he's our friend. And we
are lying to him through our teeth.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.089
- Dean...
- He burned the wrong bones.

12:12.501 --> 12:14.581
- So Crowley tricked him.
- He's an angel.

12:15.037 --> 12:17.617
He is the Balki Bartokomous of heaven.
He can make a mistake.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.310
Nobody's saying nothing yet.

12:19.641 --> 12:22.831
You think that Cass
is in with Crowley? Crowley?

12:23.445 --> 12:25.465
Look, I'm just saying I don't know.

12:26.114 --> 12:28.164
Now, look, I hate myself
for even thinking it...

12:28.617 --> 12:30.727
but I don't know.

12:32.821 --> 12:34.871
Look, Dean, he's our friend too, okay?

12:35.323 --> 12:39.133
And I'd die for him, I would,
but, look, I'm praying we're wrong here.

12:39.828 --> 12:43.638
But if we ain't, if there's a snowball
of a snowball's chance here...

12:44.332 --> 12:47.082
that means we're dealing
with a Superman who's gone dark side.

12:47.903 --> 12:51.003
Which means we've gotta be cautious.
We gotta be smart.

12:51.606 --> 12:53.216
And maybe stock up
on some kryptonite.

12:57.979 --> 13:00.029
This makes you Lois Lane.

13:00.482 --> 13:02.122
Look, one problem at a time here.

13:02.818 --> 13:04.158
We gotta find Crowley now...

13:04.553 --> 13:07.243
before the damn fool
cracks open purgatory.

13:08.924 --> 13:11.414
<i>So they already suspected.</i>

13:11.927 --> 13:13.977
- Where's Crowley?
- Up yours.

13:19.468 --> 13:24.218
<i>- And the worst part was
- Dean trying so hard to be loyal.</i>

13:25.073 --> 13:27.913
<i>With every instinct
telling him otherwise.</i>

13:29.611 --> 13:33.071
- I don't know where Crowley is.
- Are you sure about that?

13:33.715 --> 13:35.765
We can twist again
all the way to next summer.

13:36.218 --> 13:41.138
No. No, God. I never even met him.
I don't deal with Crowley direct.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.220
Well, who do you deal with?

13:43.592 --> 13:45.082
The dispatcher.

13:46.194 --> 13:48.184
A demon named Ellsworth.

13:55.370 --> 13:57.650
<i>If there was a demon counterpart
to Bobby Singer...</i>

13:58.140 --> 13:59.950
<i>Ellsworth would be it.</i>

14:00.375 --> 14:02.125
Oh, no, listen. No.

14:02.544 --> 14:03.804
I don't care.

14:04.146 --> 14:07.606
I want you to get down to New Mexico
and bag me that Wendigo.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.330
The hell, hang on. What?

14:12.654 --> 14:14.904
Because the boss says
we're done with him.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.068
FBI, Thomas speaking.

14:22.931 --> 14:25.241
Absolutely, I sent them.
Thanks for calling to check.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.104
You have a nice day now. Bye-bye.

14:28.637 --> 14:32.207
Hey, hey, hey, no.
Not in here, you frigging yeti. Out back.

14:32.874 --> 14:35.484
<i>These demons would lead
the Winchesters to Crowley.</i>

14:36.344 --> 14:38.864
<i>And Crowley would tear
their hearts out.</i>

14:44.386 --> 14:45.936
Oh, hell.

14:59.401 --> 15:01.211
<i>I had no choice.</i>

15:01.670 --> 15:03.450
<i>I did it to protect the boys.</i>

15:04.239 --> 15:05.729
<i>Or to protect myself.</i>

15:06.107 --> 15:07.977
<i>I don't know anymore.</i>

15:22.349 --> 15:24.489
Hey, clear from the back.

15:25.385 --> 15:27.115
Demons get tipped and bugged out?

15:27.521 --> 15:29.481
Maybe they run from us now.

15:29.957 --> 15:33.437
- Yeah, that'd be a nice thought, right?
- Yeah, if that's what happened.

15:34.528 --> 15:35.758
Yeah.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.067
<i>Hiding. Lying.</i>

15:43.670 --> 15:45.040
<i>Sweeping away evidence.</i>

15:46.406 --> 15:49.276
<i>And my motives used to be so pure.</i>

15:49.943 --> 15:54.453
<i>After supposedly saving Sam,
I finally returned to heaven.</i>

15:59.453 --> 16:04.373
<i>Of course there isn't one heaven.
Each soul generates its own paradise.</i>

16:06.326 --> 16:09.226
<i>I favored the eternal Tuesday afternoon
of an autistic man...</i>

16:09.796 --> 16:11.986
<i>who'd drowned in a bathtub in 2953.</i>

16:25.512 --> 16:28.062
- You're alive.
- Yes.

16:28.582 --> 16:30.692
Castiel, we saw Lucifer destroy you.

16:31.151 --> 16:32.461
Well, I came back.

16:32.819 --> 16:35.629
But Lucifer, Michael?

16:36.223 --> 16:37.803
They're gone.

16:38.592 --> 16:39.902
It was God, wasn't it?

16:41.361 --> 16:42.731
No.

16:43.163 --> 16:46.943
It was the Winchesters.
They brought down the apocalypse.

16:47.634 --> 16:50.294
But you beat the archangels, Castiel.

16:50.837 --> 16:53.387
God brought you back.
He chose you, Cass.

16:54.307 --> 16:56.207
- To lead us.
- No.

16:56.643 --> 16:58.833
No one leads us anymore.

16:59.312 --> 17:03.412
We're all free to make our own choices
and to choose our own fates.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.961
What does God want?

17:09.289 --> 17:11.569
God wants you to have freedom.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.424
But what does he want us to do
with it?

17:16.663 --> 17:21.762
<i>- If I knew then what I know now,
- I might've said, "It's simple.</i>

17:22.636 --> 17:26.066
<i>Freedom is a length of rope.
God wants you to hang yourself with it."</i>

17:28.040 --> 17:30.941
<i>Those first weeks back in heaven
were surprisingly difficult.</i>

17:32.412 --> 17:36.752
<i>Explaining freedom to angels
is a bit like teaching poetry to fish.</i>

17:39.286 --> 17:41.976
<i>And then there was Raphael.</i>

17:42.689 --> 17:44.179
You came.

17:44.558 --> 17:46.838
I appreciate the courage that takes.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.537
Whose heaven is this?

17:56.069 --> 17:57.939
Ken Lay's. I'm borrowing it.

17:59.406 --> 18:01.486
I still question his admittance here.

18:01.942 --> 18:04.492
He's devout. Trumps everything.

18:08.014 --> 18:09.274
What do you want?

18:09.616 --> 18:12.636
Tomorrow. I've called for
a full assembly of the Holy Host.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.950
You'll kneel before me and pledge
allegiance to the flag, all right?

18:17.557 --> 18:20.247
- And what flag is that?
- Me, Castiel.

18:20.827 --> 18:21.787
Allegiance to me.

18:22.329 --> 18:23.379
Are you joking?

18:23.697 --> 18:25.367
Do I look like I'm joking?

18:26.833 --> 18:28.673
You never look like you're joking.

18:29.102 --> 18:31.532
You rebelled.
Against God, heaven and me.

18:32.405 --> 18:34.185
Now you will atone.

18:34.908 --> 18:37.538
We'll start by freeing Lucifer
and Michael from their cage.

18:38.078 --> 18:40.328
And then we'll get our show
back on the road.

18:40.847 --> 18:42.687
Raphael, no.

18:44.084 --> 18:46.544
The apocalypse
doesn't have to be fought.

18:47.053 --> 18:48.753
Of course it does. It's God's will.

18:49.356 --> 18:50.846
How can you say that?

18:51.224 --> 18:52.834
Because it's what I want.

18:53.426 --> 18:55.006
Well, the other angels won't let you.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.012
Are you sure?

18:57.664 --> 19:00.734
You know better than anyone, Castiel.
They're soldiers.

19:01.368 --> 19:03.998
They weren't built for freedom.
They were built to follow.

19:11.444 --> 19:12.734
Then I won't let you.

19:13.180 --> 19:14.140
Really?

19:15.615 --> 19:16.925
You?

19:31.998 --> 19:35.778
<i>I'm not ashamed to say that my
big brother knocked me into next week.</i>

19:36.469 --> 19:38.579
Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel.

19:39.039 --> 19:41.469
Or you and anyone with you dies.

19:45.278 --> 19:46.508
Hey.

19:46.847 --> 19:48.597
The place is clean.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.600
Yeah, but it's...

19:52.619 --> 19:54.609
It's like Mr. Clean clean, you know?

19:55.055 --> 19:57.165
It's kind of OCD
for your average demon.

19:57.624 --> 19:59.234
Yeah. So, what now?

19:59.626 --> 20:00.996
- We'd call Cass.
- What?

20:03.363 --> 20:05.943
This is usually the point
where we would call Cass for help.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.763
- We talked about this.
- Yeah, Dean.

20:09.202 --> 20:11.782
No, you talked. I listened.

20:13.373 --> 20:14.803
This is Cass, guys.

20:15.809 --> 20:17.709
I mean, when there was no one...

20:18.144 --> 20:21.044
and we were stuck,
and I mean really stuck, he broke ranks.

20:21.715 --> 20:25.345
He has gone to the mat, cut and
bleeding for us, so many frigging times.

20:26.019 --> 20:27.309
This is Cass.

20:27.654 --> 20:29.904
Don't we owe him
the benefit of the doubt, at least?

20:35.695 --> 20:38.035
Castiel, this is really important, okay?

20:38.531 --> 20:39.871
Um...

20:40.233 --> 20:42.253
We really need to talk to you.

20:43.837 --> 20:46.387
Castiel, come on in.

20:50.110 --> 20:51.920
<i>But I didn't go to them.</i>

20:52.345 --> 20:55.715
<i>Because I knew they would
have questions I couldn't answer.</i>

20:56.616 --> 20:57.876
<i>Because I was afraid.</i>

21:01.087 --> 21:02.577
Cass is busy.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.550
It's all right. We are too.

21:06.893 --> 21:08.183
Come on.

21:08.995 --> 21:11.865
- Back to square one.
- Great. Well, what do we do now?

21:12.432 --> 21:15.152
Well, we caught one hunter demon
before, we can do it again.

21:16.269 --> 21:17.699
Dean!

21:22.208 --> 21:23.608
Crowley says hi.

21:31.618 --> 21:33.698
<i>Crowley sent his very best.</i>

21:34.688 --> 21:37.058
<i>I was caught as much by surprise
as the rest of them.</i>

21:39.326 --> 21:41.436
<i>And it left me
with yet another choice:</i>

21:44.698 --> 21:47.478
<i>I could reveal myself
and smite the demons.</i>

21:48.034 --> 21:49.644
<i>Of course Crowley wouldn't like it...</i>

21:50.036 --> 21:53.166
<i>but on the other hand,
they were my friends.</i>

22:04.551 --> 22:07.301
<i>For a brief moment, I was me again.</i>

22:16.429 --> 22:17.949
It is good to see you, Cass.

22:18.565 --> 22:20.295
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

22:20.700 --> 22:21.720
Perfect timing, Cass.

22:22.035 --> 22:24.225
I'm glad I found you.
I come with news.

22:24.871 --> 22:26.101
Yeah? What?

22:26.439 --> 22:29.779
I firmly believe Crowley is alive.

22:32.212 --> 22:33.852
Yeah. You think, Kojak?

22:38.284 --> 22:41.304
Well, Bobby, what do you think
about Cass saving our asses? Again?

22:44.424 --> 22:46.064
I think we owe you an apology.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.040
Why?

22:48.361 --> 22:50.731
We've been hunting Crowley
this whole time.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.571
And keeping it from you.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.100
We thought
you were working with him.

22:57.037 --> 22:59.437
- You thought what?
- I know. It's crazy, right?

22:59.939 --> 23:02.659
It's just that you torched
the wrong bones...

23:03.209 --> 23:04.959
It doesn't matter. We were wrong.

23:05.478 --> 23:07.088
You know...

23:07.747 --> 23:09.207
you could've just asked me.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.180
And we should have.

23:12.185 --> 23:13.825
We never should've doubted you.

23:15.455 --> 23:17.355
We just hope you can forgive us.

23:19.592 --> 23:21.462
<i>Wonders never cease.</i>

23:21.895 --> 23:24.385
<i>They trusted me again.</i>

23:24.898 --> 23:26.298
<i>But it was just another lie.</i>

23:26.699 --> 23:27.629
It's forgotten.

23:28.768 --> 23:29.998
Thanks.

23:30.336 --> 23:32.796
Yeah, thanks, Cass.

23:34.574 --> 23:36.974
- It is a little absurd, though.
- I know, I know.

23:37.477 --> 23:39.027
Superman going to the dark side.

23:42.515 --> 23:44.975
I'm still just Castiel.

23:47.454 --> 23:50.704
- I guess we can put away the kryptonite.
- Exactly.

23:51.324 --> 23:54.984
<i>Of course I didn't realize it
at the time, but it was all over.</i>

23:55.662 --> 23:58.002
<i>Right then. Just like that.</i>

23:59.732 --> 24:02.252
- You sent demons after them?
- You kill my hunters...

24:02.769 --> 24:05.109
- why can't I kill yours?
- They're my friends.

24:05.605 --> 24:08.565
You can't have friends. Not anymore.
I mean, my God. You're losing it.

24:09.142 --> 24:10.482
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

24:10.844 --> 24:12.574
You're the very picture
of mental health.

24:12.979 --> 24:14.879
You don't think I know
what this is all about?

24:15.315 --> 24:19.005
- Enlighten me.
- The big lie, the Winchesters still buy it.

24:19.686 --> 24:22.056
The good Cass, the righteous Cass.

24:22.555 --> 24:25.245
And long as they still believe it,
you get to believe it.

24:25.792 --> 24:28.952
Well, I got news for you, kitten.
A whore is a whore is a whore.

24:32.499 --> 24:34.369
I'm only gonna say this once.

24:34.801 --> 24:39.691
If you touch a hair on their heads,
I will tear it all down.

24:40.540 --> 24:43.120
Our arrangement, everything.

24:45.512 --> 24:47.442
I'm still an angel...

24:47.914 --> 24:49.644
and I will bury you.

24:54.854 --> 24:58.134
<i>- I asked myself,
- "What was I doing with this vermin?"</i>

24:58.791 --> 25:01.601
This is not how synergy works.

25:02.395 --> 25:04.615
<i>As if I didn't already know
the answer.</i>

25:06.533 --> 25:08.703
<i>Raphael was stronger than me.</i>

25:09.369 --> 25:12.209
<i>And I wouldn't survive a straight fight.</i>

25:16.075 --> 25:18.705
<i>So I went to an old friend for help.</i>

25:20.180 --> 25:23.430
<i>But watching him, I stopped.</i>

25:24.050 --> 25:28.740
<i>Everything he sacrificed
and I was about to ask him for more.</i>

25:30.223 --> 25:33.473
Ah, Castiel, angel of Thursday.

25:34.260 --> 25:35.310
Just not your day, is it?

25:36.462 --> 25:37.482
What are you doing here?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.970
I want to help you help me
help ourselves.

25:40.433 --> 25:41.483
Speak plain.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.384
I want to discuss
a simple business transaction. That's all.

25:44.904 --> 25:46.834
You wanna make a deal? With me?

25:48.541 --> 25:50.181
I'm an angel, you ass.

25:50.577 --> 25:51.887
I don't have a soul to sell.

25:52.245 --> 25:54.175
But that's it, isn't it? It's all of it.

25:54.614 --> 25:58.594
It's the souls. It all comes down
to the souls in the end, doesn't it?

25:59.352 --> 26:01.932
- What are you talking about?
- Raphael's head on a pike.

26:02.455 --> 26:07.845
I'm talking about happy endings for all of
us, with all possible entendres intended.

26:08.761 --> 26:10.051
Come on.

26:10.396 --> 26:11.796
Just a chat.

26:12.165 --> 26:15.625
- I have no interest in talking with you.
- Why not? I'm very interesting.

26:17.737 --> 26:19.287
Come on. Hear me out.

26:19.672 --> 26:21.422
Five minutes. No obligations.

26:22.141 --> 26:23.751
I promise.

26:24.444 --> 26:25.754
I'll make it worth your while.

26:26.112 --> 26:27.632
<i>I was no fool.</i>

26:28.014 --> 26:30.064
<i>I knew who Crowley was
and what he did.</i>

26:30.516 --> 26:33.446
<i>But I was smarter than him, stronger.</i>

26:34.020 --> 26:38.850
<i>I see now that I was prideful.
And in all likelihood, I was a fool.</i>

26:54.841 --> 26:56.101
Where are we?

26:57.110 --> 26:58.600
You don't recognize it, do you?

26:59.178 --> 27:01.198
It's Hades, new and improved.

27:01.648 --> 27:02.988
I did it myself.

27:05.184 --> 27:07.084
- This is hell?
- Yeah.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.120
Problem with the old place was most
of the inmates were masochists already.

27:11.791 --> 27:13.251
A lot of, "Thank you, sir.

27:13.626 --> 27:16.556
Can I have another hot spike up
the jacksie?" But just look at them.

27:17.463 --> 27:19.103
<i>Next.</i>

27:21.234 --> 27:23.134
No one likes waiting in line.

27:23.569 --> 27:25.119
When they reach the front?

27:25.505 --> 27:27.645
Nothing. They go
right back to the end again.

27:28.174 --> 27:29.104
That's efficiency.

27:29.976 --> 27:31.586
You have four minutes left.

27:32.478 --> 27:34.558
What are you planning to do
about Raphael?

27:35.014 --> 27:39.174
- What can I do besides submit or die?
- Submit or die? What are you, French?

27:39.952 --> 27:41.002
How about resist?

27:41.321 --> 27:43.601
I'm not strong enough
and you know it.

27:44.090 --> 27:46.430
Not on your own, you're not.
But you're not on your own.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.239
There's a lot of angels
swooning over you.

27:49.729 --> 27:52.689
God's favorite. Buddy boy, you've got
what they call sex appeal.

27:53.266 --> 27:54.666
Thank you. Get to the point.

27:55.034 --> 27:57.874
Angels need leaders, so be one.

27:58.471 --> 28:02.041
Gather your army and kick the candy out
of each and every angel...

28:02.709 --> 28:03.939
that shows up for Raphael.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.450
Are you proposing
that I start a civil war in heaven?

28:08.047 --> 28:09.247
Ding, ding, ding.

28:09.582 --> 28:13.272
- Tell him what he's won, Vanna.
- You're asking me to be the next Lucifer.

28:13.986 --> 28:17.326
Please. Lucifer was a petulant child
with daddy issues.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.920
Cass, you love God.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.670
God loves you.

28:22.028 --> 28:22.958
He brought you back.

28:23.529 --> 28:25.869
Did it occur to you
that maybe he did this...

28:26.366 --> 28:29.206
so you could be
the new sheriff upstairs?

28:31.571 --> 28:34.851
This is ridiculous. The power
that it would take to mount a war...

28:35.708 --> 28:38.778
More than either of us
have ever seen, yeah.

28:39.379 --> 28:42.369
But what if I said
I knew how to go nuclear?

28:44.083 --> 28:45.013
What do you mean?

28:45.518 --> 28:47.768
Purgatory, my fine feathered friend.

28:48.254 --> 28:49.624
Purgatory.

28:50.123 --> 28:51.143
Just think about it.

28:51.457 --> 28:55.527
An untapped oil well
of every fanged, clawed soul.

28:56.262 --> 28:59.252
I mean, what's that over the years,
30 million? Forty?

28:59.832 --> 29:02.872
Just sitting there,
plump and rich for the taking.

29:03.469 --> 29:05.959
And how would you find it
when no one ever has?

29:06.472 --> 29:07.782
We'll need expert help.

29:08.141 --> 29:10.041
- From whom?
- From experts, of course.

29:10.476 --> 29:13.286
<i>I know two eerily suited Teen Beat
models with time on their hands.</i>

29:13.846 --> 29:17.326
No. Not Dean.
He's retired and he's to stay that way.

29:18.284 --> 29:19.304
Fine.

29:19.619 --> 29:22.549
Then I know of a certain big,
bald patriarch I can take off the bench.

29:23.122 --> 29:26.312
The point is,
they can get us to the monsters.

29:26.926 --> 29:29.506
The monsters can get us to purgatory.
I know it.

29:30.062 --> 29:33.312
- And what's your price in all of this?
- Just half.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.786
- Half?
- My position isn't all that stable, ducky.

29:37.336 --> 29:40.646
Those souls would help,
just like they'd help you.

29:41.274 --> 29:43.824
Besides, wouldn't you rather have me
in charge down here?

29:44.343 --> 29:45.363
The devil you know.

29:45.678 --> 29:47.518
<i>Next.</i>

29:50.683 --> 29:52.553
This is pointless.

29:53.019 --> 29:56.269
Your plan would take months
and I need help now.

29:56.889 --> 29:58.939
Granted. Yes.

29:59.692 --> 30:03.172
But just to show you how serious I am
about this scheme...

30:03.830 --> 30:05.640
how about I float you a little loan?

30:06.098 --> 30:07.908
Say, 50 large?

30:08.334 --> 30:10.554
Fifty-thousand souls from the pit.

30:11.471 --> 30:12.931
You can take them up to heaven.

30:13.306 --> 30:15.056
Make quite a showing.

30:16.509 --> 30:18.819
It's either this or the apocalypse
all over again.

30:19.512 --> 30:23.322
Everything you've worked for, everything
that Sam and Dean have worked for...

30:24.016 --> 30:25.416
gone.

30:27.487 --> 30:29.567
You can save us, Castiel.

30:33.159 --> 30:36.229
God chose you to save us.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.820
And I think...

30:39.198 --> 30:40.128
deep down...

30:41.400 --> 30:42.390
you know that.

30:43.002 --> 30:46.432
<i>- I wish I could say
- I was clean of pride at that moment...</i>

30:47.073 --> 30:49.063
<i>or the next.</i>

31:02.855 --> 31:06.105
There will be no apocalypse.

31:06.726 --> 31:11.966
And let it be known, you're either
with Raphael or you're with me.

31:12.965 --> 31:16.565
<i>And so went the long road
of good intentions...</i>

31:17.904 --> 31:19.574
<i>the road that brought me here.</i>

31:23.109 --> 31:24.069
Castiel, uh...

31:26.212 --> 31:30.222
we need you for a little powwow
down here, so come on down.

31:31.317 --> 31:32.777
Hello.

31:34.987 --> 31:37.037
Oh, Johnny-on-the-spot.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.800
- You're still here.
- Yeah, we had to bury the bodies.

31:40.826 --> 31:42.726
And we found a little whiskey.

31:43.195 --> 31:44.425
Thanks for coming.

31:44.764 --> 31:47.984
- How can I help?
- Oh, look. We, um... We have a new plan.

31:48.601 --> 31:51.791
We think we've finally figured out a way
to track down Crowley.

31:53.973 --> 31:55.933
- What is it?
- It's you.

32:11.257 --> 32:12.957
What are you doing?

32:13.859 --> 32:15.819
- We gotta talk.
- About what? Let me go.

32:16.262 --> 32:17.282
About Superman.

32:18.664 --> 32:19.684
And kryptonite.

32:22.068 --> 32:24.438
- How'd you know what I said?
- How long you been watching?

32:24.937 --> 32:26.687
You know who spies
on people, Cass? Spies.

32:27.106 --> 32:29.976
Okay, just wait.
I don't even know what you mean.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.356
What about this demon craphole?

32:32.778 --> 32:35.738
How is it so, uh, next-to-godliness clean
in here?

32:36.315 --> 32:38.535
And how did Crowley trick you
with the wrong bones?

32:39.018 --> 32:41.828
That is hard to understand.
It's hard to explain.

32:42.388 --> 32:45.638
- Just let me go. Let me out and I can...
- You gotta look at me, man.

32:46.459 --> 32:49.589
You gotta level with me
and tell me what's going on.

32:50.196 --> 32:53.266
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not working with Crowley.

33:00.740 --> 33:01.700
Son of a bitch.

33:04.610 --> 33:05.690
Let me explain.

33:06.012 --> 33:07.532
You're in it with him?

33:07.913 --> 33:10.903
You and Crowley have been going
after purgatory together?

33:12.418 --> 33:14.908
You have, huh? This whole time.

33:15.421 --> 33:17.321
I did it to protect you, all of you.

33:17.757 --> 33:18.987
Protect us how?

33:19.325 --> 33:21.375
By opening a hole into monsterland?

33:21.827 --> 33:24.457
He's right, Cass.
One drop got through and it was Eve.

33:24.997 --> 33:26.637
And you wanna break down
the entire dam?

33:27.033 --> 33:28.023
To get the souls.

33:28.868 --> 33:31.058
I can stop Raphael.

33:31.537 --> 33:34.087
- Please, you have to trust me.
- Trust you?

33:34.640 --> 33:36.570
How in the hell are we
supposed to trust you?

33:37.009 --> 33:37.969
I'm still me.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.237
I'm still your friend.

33:42.214 --> 33:45.174
Sam, I am the one who raised you
from perdition.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.365
What?

33:54.760 --> 33:59.270
Well, no offense,
but you did a pretty piss-poor job of it.

34:02.601 --> 34:03.561
Wait.

34:04.804 --> 34:07.794
Did you bring me back soulless
on purpose?

34:11.177 --> 34:12.226
How could you think that?

34:12.545 --> 34:15.125
Well, I'm thinking a lot of things
right now, Cass.

34:17.248 --> 34:18.739
Listen.

34:19.552 --> 34:22.512
Raphael will kill us all.

34:23.089 --> 34:26.079
He'll turn the world into a graveyard.

34:26.692 --> 34:27.802
I had no choice.

34:28.127 --> 34:30.177
No, you had a choice.

34:30.795 --> 34:32.196
You just made the wrong one.

34:34.065 --> 34:35.996
You don't understand.

34:36.435 --> 34:37.514
It's complicated.

34:37.837 --> 34:40.177
No, actually,
it's not and you know that.

34:40.706 --> 34:44.136
Why would you keep this whole thing
a secret, unless you knew it was wrong?

34:48.214 --> 34:51.524
When crap like this comes around,
we deal with it...

34:52.150 --> 34:54.081
like we always have.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.980
What we don't do is we don't go out
and make another deal with the devil.

34:59.091 --> 35:01.641
Yeah, it sounds so simple
when you say it like that.

35:05.264 --> 35:06.904
Where were you
when I needed to hear it?

35:08.167 --> 35:09.897
I was there.

35:10.302 --> 35:11.592
Where were you?

35:19.011 --> 35:21.501
You should've come to us
for help, Cass.

35:23.449 --> 35:24.819
Maybe.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.408
It's too late now.

35:35.361 --> 35:37.791
I can't turn back now. I can't.

35:38.631 --> 35:39.681
It's not too late.

35:40.132 --> 35:43.002
- Damn it, Cass. We can fix this.
- Dean, it's not broken.

35:48.174 --> 35:51.244
Run. You have to run, now. Run!

36:30.717 --> 36:32.087
My, my.

36:32.452 --> 36:33.682
Playing with fire again?

36:35.722 --> 36:37.972
If you touch the Winchesters...

36:39.226 --> 36:41.246
Please, heard you the first time.

36:41.695 --> 36:45.325
I promise, nary a hair
on their artfully tousled heads.

36:45.999 --> 36:48.189
Besides, I think they've proven
my point for me.

36:48.935 --> 36:51.075
It's always your friends, isn't it,
in the end?

36:52.005 --> 36:54.025
We try to change.
We try to improve ourselves.

36:54.474 --> 36:58.664
It's always our friends who gotta claw
into our sides and hold us back.

37:01.047 --> 37:02.537
But you know what I see here?

37:02.949 --> 37:05.609
The new God and the new devil
working together.

37:06.152 --> 37:07.902
Enough.

37:08.588 --> 37:10.488
You stop talking.

37:12.325 --> 37:14.545
And get out of my sight.

37:17.364 --> 37:18.794
Well...

37:20.066 --> 37:21.326
glad I came.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.470
You're welcome, by the way.

37:36.049 --> 37:38.629
You know the difference
between you and me?

37:39.719 --> 37:42.379
I know what I am.

37:45.058 --> 37:46.368
What are you, Castiel?

37:48.395 --> 37:52.315
What exactly are you willing to do?

38:18.591 --> 38:20.081
Hello, Dean.

38:20.460 --> 38:21.830
How'd you get in here?

38:22.295 --> 38:26.715
The angel-proofing Bobby put up on
the house, he got a few things wrong.

38:28.401 --> 38:31.421
Well, it's too bad we gotta angel-proof
in the first place, isn't it?

38:33.440 --> 38:34.520
Why are you here?

38:36.609 --> 38:39.129
- I want you to understand.
- Oh, believe me, I get it.

38:40.914 --> 38:44.634
- Blah, blah, Raphael, right?
- I'm doing this for you, Dean.

38:45.318 --> 38:46.608
I'm doing this because of you.

38:46.953 --> 38:49.323
Because of me. Yeah.

38:49.823 --> 38:51.783
You gotta be kidding me.

38:52.859 --> 38:56.229
You're the one who taught me
that freedom and free will...

38:56.863 --> 38:58.613
You're a frigging child,
you know that?

39:00.133 --> 39:01.773
Just because you can do
what you want...

39:02.168 --> 39:04.538
doesn't mean that you get to do
whatever you want.

39:05.071 --> 39:07.001
I know what I'm doing, Dean.

39:10.009 --> 39:12.789
I'm not gonna logic you, okay?

39:13.847 --> 39:16.567
I'm saying don't just because.

39:17.517 --> 39:20.127
I'm asking you not to.

39:20.653 --> 39:21.583
That's it.

39:21.888 --> 39:22.848
I don't understand.

39:23.156 --> 39:26.526
Look, next to Sam, you and Bobby
are the closest things I have to family...

39:27.160 --> 39:28.770
that you are like a brother to me.

39:29.162 --> 39:31.912
So if I'm asking you
not to do something...

39:34.634 --> 39:36.304
You gotta trust me, man.

39:39.205 --> 39:40.665
Or what?

39:46.112 --> 39:49.422
- Or I'll have to do what I have to do.
- You can't, Dean.

39:50.917 --> 39:51.877
You're just a man.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.520
I'm an angel.

39:55.889 --> 39:58.469
I don't know.
I've taken some pretty big fish.

40:03.430 --> 40:04.540
I'm sorry, Dean.

40:07.167 --> 40:08.477
Well, I'm sorry too, then.

40:15.542 --> 40:18.292
So that's everything.

40:19.078 --> 40:21.388
I believe it's what you would call...

40:22.449 --> 40:25.319
a tragedy
from the human perspective.

40:25.885 --> 40:30.015
But maybe the human perspective
is limited. I don't know.

40:30.757 --> 40:32.457
That's why I'm asking you, Father.

40:34.294 --> 40:36.254
One last time.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.020
Am I doing the right thing?

40:41.034 --> 40:43.964
Am I on the right path?

40:44.537 --> 40:47.727
You have to tell me.
You have to give me a sign.

40:50.410 --> 40:53.450
Give me a sign.

40:54.047 --> 40:56.447
Because if you don't, I'm gonna ju...

40:57.550 --> 40:59.660
I'm gonna do whatever I...

41:00.286 --> 41:02.216
Whatever I must.
