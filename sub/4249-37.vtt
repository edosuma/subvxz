IT WAS LIKE BEING FREEZE-DRIED.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.682
- WERE YOU IN PAIN?
WERE YOU AWAKE?

12:46.765 --> 12:50.478
- MY EYES WERE FROZEN,
SO I COULD SEE STRAIGHT AHEAD.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.481
I COULD HEAR, THOUGH.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.232
I HEARD YOUR CONCERN FOR ME,
VICTOR.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.734
- OH, YES.
[clears throat]

12:56.817 --> 12:58.736
YES, I-I-I, UM...

12:58.819 --> 13:00.654
- I HAD THE STRANGEST DREAM.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.281
WE WERE DOWN IN THE CELLAR,

13:02.364 --> 13:06.327
AND A WOMAN WAS DEMANDING THAT
WE STOP OUR SEARCH FOR THE MASK,

13:06.410 --> 13:08.537
AND SHE WANTED--

13:08.621 --> 13:11.165
- UH, VERA, I HAD EXACTLY
THE SAME DREAM.

13:11.248 --> 13:16.378
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A DREAM.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.005
- [gasps]

13:18.088 --> 13:22.301
- THE MARK OF ANUBIS.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.762
UH-UH-UH-UH
UH-UH-UH-UH.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.014
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

13:27.097 --> 13:27.723
- WE'RE GOING TO THE LIBRARY.

13:27.806 --> 13:31.060
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:31.143 --> 13:31.727
[door slams]

13:31.810 --> 13:33.020
- HI.
- HELLO.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.987
- GREAT, THERE GOES
OUR BEST CHANCE

13:42.071 --> 13:44.073
AT SNEAKING DOWN
TO THE TASK CHAMBER.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.824
WE CAN'T GO TO THE LIBRARY.
THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.160
AND WE CAN'T DO IT AT NIGHT,
EITHER.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.954
- AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.413
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

13:51.497 --> 13:53.415
WHEN THE MOON REACHES THE SUN
IN THE TASK CHAMBER,

13:53.499 --> 13:54.333
BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.960
- LOOK, WE'LL GO DOWN AT DAWN.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.046
IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION.
SIBUNA?

14:02.466 --> 14:03.384
- HEY, FABS.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.387
- HEY, UM,
I WONDERED IF YOU KNEW

14:06.470 --> 14:08.264
WHO WROTE THAT STUFF ABOUT NINA
ON THE WEBSITE.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.391
- WEBSITE?

14:10.474 --> 14:11.809
- WELL, THE WEBSITE
YOU'RE EDITOR OF

14:11.892 --> 14:14.311
AND CHECK
ALL THE SUBMISSIONS TO

14:14.395 --> 14:15.938
AND GENERALLY RUN.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.939
- OKAY, I GET YOU.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.024
WHICH ARTICLE, NOW?

14:19.108 --> 14:23.571
- JOY, THE JACKAL ANONYMOUS
BLOG.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.906
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE JACK JACKAL.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.742
- I'M NOT JACK JACKAL.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.203
- SO YOU DIDN'T WRITE
THAT PIECE ON NINA?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.998
- NO.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.792
I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THAT POSTING
ON NINA ANYWAY.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.127
- THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.795
THAT'S VERY BAD EDITORSHIP, JOY.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.965
- NO, IT'S JUST--

14:43.048 --> 14:44.133
WELL, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT NINA'S SCHOLARSHIP

14:44.216 --> 14:46.468
AND WHETHER SHE FLIES
HER SICK GRAN HOME.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.511
BUT IF MY USERS WANT TO READ
THAT SORT OF STUFF,

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
WELL, WHO AM I TO--

14:49.555 --> 14:53.017
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T READ IT.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.435
- HAVEN'T.

14:54.518 --> 14:58.314
- YOU JUST QUOTED IT...
TWICE.

14:58.397 --> 15:03.736
THAT IS A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE THING TO DO.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.779
OH, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE WORST PART?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.324
I DEFENDED YOU.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.702
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL
I USED TO KNOW, JOY.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.956
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE BOY
I USED TO KNOW.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
[all whispering]

15:17.750 --> 15:22.212
THAT'S RIGHT, CLOSE RANKS
LIKE YOU GUYS ALWAYS DO.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.757
[all whispering]

15:27.885 --> 15:29.219
- IT'S WAY TOO EARLY.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.596
MY HEAD'S NOT GOING ON
WITH THE REST OF MY BODY.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.805
- OH, NO.

15:31.889 --> 15:32.806
- ALL RIGHT,
THE MOON'S NEARLY OVER IT.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.808
COME ON, WE NEED TO GO,
RIGHT NOW.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.894
- REFLECTORS, QUICK.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.270
- ALL RIGHT.
- IS THAT RIGHT?

15:38.354 --> 15:43.275
ALFIE.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.485
- AMBER.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.527
- HURRY, HURRY.
- I CAN'T TELL.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.112
- HURRY.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.990
- IT'S NEARLY OVER.
IT'S NEARLY OVER.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.534
- NINA, COME ON.
- HURRY UP.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.954
[all shouting]

15:56.038 --> 15:58.040
- COME ON.
- NINA.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.375
[zapping]

15:59.458 --> 16:02.086
all: NO!

16:02.169 --> 16:03.629
- CONSTELLATION FAIL.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.555
- SO ARE YOU STILL VISITING
YOUR DAD THIS AFTERNOON?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
- ONLY IF YOU COME TOO.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
I NEED BACKUP, JAFFRAY.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.103
- WHY?

16:19.186 --> 16:21.188
- FOR WHEN I TELL HIM
ABOUT THE GEM.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.524
BECAUSE WHEN I TELL HIM
I'VE LOST IT,

16:23.607 --> 16:25.651
I THINK HE IS GOING TO LOSE IT.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.196
- I THINK HE CARES MORE
ABOUT YOU THAN THE GEM.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.572
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.282
"HI, DAD, GREAT NEWS.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.243
"YOU KNOW THAT 30 YEARS
OF BAD LUCK YOU GOT

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
"FOR STEALING THAT GEM?

16:35.994 --> 16:38.497
WELL, SURPRISE, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO THE FULL STRETCH."

16:38.580 --> 16:41.083
I'M SURE HE'LL BE THRILLED.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.209
- SO I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT MY GRAN,

16:42.292 --> 16:46.839
AND MAYBE IT IS BEST
IF I TOOK HER HOME.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.216
- NINA, DEAR?
A QUICK WORD PLEASE.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.635
- SURE, I GUESS.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.429
- SURE, SEE YOU LATER.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.140
- ODD.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.891
- FABS?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.935
I JUST WANTED TO SAY SORRY.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.604
JACK JACKAL WAS OUT OF ORDER.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.147
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S AWFULLY BIG OF YOU, JACK.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.276
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ME
YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING TO.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.527
IT'S NINA.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.654
- YOU WROTE THAT POSTING?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.115
I KNEW IT.
CLASSY, JOY.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.242
- SO YOU'RE JACK JACKAL.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.953
- NOT EXACTLY.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.413
- OH, YEAH, SURE, JOY.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.290
- IT'S TRUE.
I'M NOT JACK.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.127
LISTEN, CAN WE TALK PRIVATELY?

17:25.210 --> 17:26.502
I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.256
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR EXPLANATIONS, JOY.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.436
- IT'S ABOUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.646
THE HOSPITAL CALLED
JUST AFTER YOU LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.148
I'M AFRAID YOUR GRAN HAS TAKEN
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.151
THE DOCTORS WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO
STRAIGHTAWAY.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.486
AND I'LL COME WITH YOU,
OF COURSE.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.447
- NO.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.824
I MEAN, I'D JUST RATHER
GO ON MY OWN, IF THAT'S OKAY.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
- OF COURSE.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.919
- THE GEM WAS RIGHT THERE
IN THE SHIELD,

18:07.002 --> 18:08.212
AND THEN IT WAS GONE.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.963
- [sighs]

18:10.047 --> 18:11.590
- I LET YOU DOWN, DAD.

18:11.673 --> 18:12.883
I'M SORRY.

18:12.966 --> 18:13.926
- AT WHAT POINT
DID YOU LET ME DOWN?

18:14.009 --> 18:18.055
YOU FOUND THE MISSING GEM.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.058
THEN YOU RETRIEVED IT
FROM INSIDE A GOOSE.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.853
THEN YOU CAT BURGLED
THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO STOLE IT.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.897
THEN YOU WON
A PING-PONG CHAMPIONSHIP

18:26.980 --> 18:29.858
TO GET THE SHIELD TO PUT IT IN.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.069
- PRETTY MUCH.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.612
- YOU'RE A TRUE CLARKE.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.863
[both laugh]

18:34.947 --> 18:36.657
YOU COULDN'T WRITE IT.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.325
- SOMEONE SHOULD.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.743
"SAVED BY THE GEM:

18:39.827 --> 18:42.371
A TALE OF TWO CLARKES--
AND A GOOSE."

18:42.454 --> 18:43.539
- [laughs]

18:43.622 --> 18:44.373
WHAT DO YOU RECKON, MARA?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.458
WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO READ THAT?

18:46.542 --> 18:50.462
- WELL, ACTUALLY, YES,
DEFINITELY.

18:50.546 --> 18:56.552
- OH, HEY, I CAN, HOWEVER,
SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THE GEM.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.596
- AH, THERE SHE IS.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.850
BEAUTIFUL.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.311
- I WILL GET IT BACK, OF COURSE.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.729
I WILL.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.065
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.401
- I KNOW.

19:12.484 --> 19:17.573
OH, I SEE MY BOY'S
FINALLY GOT HIS ACT TOGETHER.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.700
- OH, NO.

19:19.783 --> 19:20.868
- SORRY?

19:20.951 --> 19:22.202
- AH.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.704
- OH, THE PING-PONG.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.664
YES, YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.791
- RIGHT, WELL, WE BETTER BE
GETTING BACK TO THE HOUSE.

19:27.875 --> 19:32.087
MARA?
- MM-HMM.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.965
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT AN ITEM?

19:35.048 --> 19:37.342
I'VE JUST SEEN A PHOTO
THAT SAID OTHERWISE.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.596
- DAD, IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.639
- THEN KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.725
THAT ONE IS A REAL GEM.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.894
AND SHE LIKES YOU.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.562
DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE, OKAY?

19:48.645 --> 19:50.898
- OKAY.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.779
- I DON'T KNOW THE NORMAL RULES

19:57.863 --> 19:59.948
FOR BEING FROZEN IN AN ATTIC
BY AN EGYPTIAN SPIRIT.

20:00.032 --> 20:04.328
I MEAN, CAN YOU HEAR?

20:04.411 --> 20:05.787
WE HAD A WHOLE CONVERSATION
ABOUT THE SECRET LIBRARY PASSAGE

20:05.871 --> 20:08.290
IN FRONT OF HER.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.792
IF SHE CAN HEAR, THE OTHERS ARE
GOING TO ABSOLUTELY KILL YOU.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.127
- WHY ME?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.380
- BECAUSE YOU'LL TAKE THE BLAME
IN ORDER TO PROTECT ME,

20:15.464 --> 20:16.798
OBVIOUSLY.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.634
- OKAY, BUT PLAN "A"
IS STILL WE JUST DON'T TELL

20:18.717 --> 20:19.176
NINA AND FABIAN, RIGHT?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.802
- TELL US WHAT?

20:20.886 --> 20:25.223
- TELL YOU...THAT...

20:25.307 --> 20:29.519
I'M ORGANIZING A CHARITY
JOG-A-THON FOR BUNIONS.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.480
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT ALLOW IT

20:31.563 --> 20:33.315
TO INTERFERE
WITH MY SIBUNA COMMITMENTS

20:33.398 --> 20:36.777
OR MY VERY SECRET USE
OF THE VERY SECRET TUNNEL.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.781
- I'VE JUST HEARD THAT NINA'S
ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.450
APPARENTLY, HER GRAN'S GOTTEN
A LOT WORSE.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.290
[monitors beeping]

21:00.634 --> 21:03.512
- FABIAN.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.346
- WHAT HAVE THE DOCTORS SAID?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.224
- THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED.

21:07.307 --> 21:10.102
SHE WAS DOING SO WELL,
AND NOW THIS.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.939
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.817
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE DOCTORS
ARE AS CONFUSED AS WE ARE.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.069
"EVELYN MERIDIAN MARTIN."

21:19.152 --> 21:22.197
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL MIDDLE NAME,
"MERIDIAN."

21:22.280 --> 21:24.199
- SOME SORT OF FAMILY NAME.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.158
WHY?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.077
- NO, NO, JUST ASKING.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.829
IT SAYS SHE WAS TAKEN ILL
IN LONDON.

21:28.912 --> 21:33.542
- SOME TOURIST ATTRACTION,
UH, "GREEN-WITCH" OBSERVATORY?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.378
- IT'S GREENWICH.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.672
GREENWICH.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.173
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS IN GREENWICH?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.384
THE INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN.

21:42.467 --> 21:46.221
- OKAY, SO?

21:46.304 --> 21:47.055
WHAT'S WRONG?
TELL ME.

21:47.139 --> 21:51.893
- GREENWICH MEAN TIME: GMT.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.771
I THINK YOUR GRAN FELL ILL

21:54.855 --> 21:58.567
RIGHT ON TOP
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN...

21:58.650 --> 21:59.401
FOR TIME.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.737
I THINK YOUR GRAN MIGHT BE--

22:01.820 --> 22:03.613
- MY GRAN IS THE TIMEPIECE?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.741
NO.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.575
GRAN, NO.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.745
[gasps]

22:09.828 --> 22:11.747
NO!

22:11.830 --> 22:13.915
NO, NO, GRAN!

22:13.999 --> 22:17.127
[evil laughter]
