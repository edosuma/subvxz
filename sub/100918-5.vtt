[Rex] Wendi, we gotta go now,
come on.

00:59.256 --> 01:02.826
[Wendi sobbing]

01:02.859 --> 01:06.197
Where are we going, Mom?

01:06.230 --> 01:07.498
-Come here.
-[car door closes]

01:07.531 --> 01:09.768
Your Dad and I are going away
for a little while.

01:09.801 --> 01:13.670
Your Uncle Matt
is gonna stay with you, okay?

01:13.703 --> 01:14.706
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:14.739 --> 01:17.474
You be good
while we're gone, Champ. Okay?

01:17.507 --> 01:18.974
-Here.
-[Wendi] Come here.

01:19.009 --> 01:20.411
Here.

01:20.444 --> 01:21.977
I had a car
just like this once.

01:22.012 --> 01:23.680
It was a '66 Mustang.

01:23.715 --> 01:28.715
It was the love of my life.
Until I met your mother.

01:29.554 --> 01:32.923
Listen, buddy, take care
of this car until we get back.

01:32.956 --> 01:36.894
It's special.
Just like you.

01:36.927 --> 01:39.397
[Wendi] Matt.
Thank you so much
for coming.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.230
Well, I could barely find
Blue Valley on a map.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.566
What the hell are you doing
way out here?

01:42.566 --> 01:44.334
Hey, what did you get
my sister into this time, huh?

01:44.334 --> 01:47.537
It wouldn't be safe
if you knew.

01:47.572 --> 01:49.140
There's paperwork inside, Matt.

01:49.173 --> 01:51.007
We left this property
in you name.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.876
All right? And Rick--

01:53.911 --> 01:55.480
It says Rick is your son.

01:55.513 --> 01:58.215
His name will be Rick Harris.
Not Rick Tyler.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.150
How did I come
from staying one night

02:00.183 --> 02:01.418
to now I'm raising your kid?

02:01.450 --> 02:02.787
Matt, please.

02:02.819 --> 02:05.456
You are the only person
we can trust.

02:05.489 --> 02:08.557
[Rex] There's a suitcase
under the bed, $50,000 inside.

02:08.557 --> 02:10.627
-Fifty thousand dollars?
-[Wendi] Please do this for us.

02:10.627 --> 02:12.795
We'll be back soon. [sobbing]

02:12.830 --> 02:14.465
-Matt.
-I don't know how
to take care of a kid.

02:14.497 --> 02:16.967
[Wendi]
Just do the best you can.

02:16.967 --> 02:19.770
Promise me, Matt.

02:19.801 --> 02:21.603
We gotta go.

02:25.209 --> 02:27.276
[car door opens]

02:27.311 --> 02:29.681
I wanna come with you.

02:29.712 --> 02:32.049
Okay. You listen
to your Uncle Matt.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.782
Okay? Can you do that?

02:33.817 --> 02:35.186
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:35.186 --> 02:37.889
We love you very, very much.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.456
We'll be back as soon as
we can, Champ. Okay? Come here.

02:40.491 --> 02:43.461
Come here. Ooh. [laughs]

02:43.492 --> 02:45.694
[whispers] Okay.

02:45.729 --> 02:48.899
Okay. All right.

02:48.931 --> 02:52.936
You be good. Okay.

02:52.968 --> 02:54.405
[Rex] Wendi, we gotta go.

02:54.437 --> 02:57.437
[Wendi] Mommy loves you.

-[Wendi crying]
-No, Dad. Don't leave me!

03:14.324 --> 03:16.961
Don't leave me.

03:16.992 --> 03:20.894
[dramatic music continues]

03:28.673 --> 03:32.842
-I'm scared, Rex.
-They don't know about Rick.

03:32.876 --> 03:35.044
He'll be fine.

03:35.079 --> 03:38.149
It's all that matters.

04:28.466 --> 04:32.637
Don't wait up, kid.

04:32.670 --> 04:36.307
-[car door opens]
-Hey.

04:36.338 --> 04:37.742
Where's my carburetor?

04:37.774 --> 04:39.509
-[Matt] What?
-The carburetor I just got,

04:39.543 --> 04:41.579
-where is it?
-I sold that.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.713
You can't just sell it,
it's mine.

04:43.747 --> 04:46.449
Gas, electric, food, I mean...

04:46.483 --> 04:48.586
who do you think pays
for all this?

04:48.619 --> 04:51.355
You will never understand
what you cost me.

04:51.389 --> 04:54.324
-If it wasn't for you--
-You'd be
a Silicon Valley millionaire,

04:54.358 --> 04:59.307
instead of
a Blue Valley dirtbag.

05:00.497 --> 05:02.899
Well, come on.

05:02.932 --> 05:06.737
Take a swing.

05:06.771 --> 05:09.875
I'll put you
on your ass again.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.526
Come on, let's go.
Yeah.

[sighs] Hmm.

06:28.117 --> 06:30.454
[Buddy panting]

06:30.487 --> 06:32.021
Ugh.

06:32.055 --> 06:34.524
No. [whines]

06:34.559 --> 06:36.194
-[Barbara] Courtney?
-[Courtney groans]

06:36.228 --> 06:38.963
Honey, it's seven o'clock
and you're not dressed.

06:38.997 --> 06:41.098
-You're gonna be late.
-Ugh.

06:41.129 --> 06:45.201
Look at this mess.

06:45.237 --> 06:50.237
Court, you've got a hamper
for a reason.

06:54.345 --> 06:55.846
Uh, I... I got it.

06:55.879 --> 06:58.915
[chuckles] You already have
so much to worry about,
I got it.

06:58.949 --> 07:00.250
Thank you.

07:00.283 --> 07:01.552
[Barbara] This new job has been

07:01.586 --> 07:03.153
-way more worse than
I thought it would be.
-[phone chimes]

07:03.187 --> 07:06.557
Oh, shoot. They moved up
my meeting, I gotta go.

07:06.591 --> 07:11.540
Happy Halloween.
Have a good day.

07:13.298 --> 07:18.298
-[Buddy panting]
-Get out. Go, demon dog. Go.

07:42.391 --> 07:44.391
[electrical buzzing]

07:47.798 --> 07:49.766
[Pat] Hey, you got something
to tell me?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.235
Let me guess,
you're running away.

07:51.235 --> 07:52.199
No, moving out.

07:52.201 --> 07:54.805
Planning on riding the rails,
right?

07:54.838 --> 07:57.641
It's a gym bag, Pat.
I have gym today.

07:57.675 --> 08:00.812
Uh-huh, okay.

08:00.845 --> 08:04.379
-What's that?
-Yeah, newspaper.

08:04.415 --> 08:05.983
-And?
-[Pat sighs]

08:06.016 --> 08:08.987
I think Joey's dad was a member
of the Injustice society.

08:09.019 --> 08:11.689
William Zarick.
We called him the Wizard.

08:11.721 --> 08:13.057
Of course you did.

08:13.091 --> 08:16.661
I think maybe he and his wife
were killed by the ISA.

08:16.694 --> 08:18.528
Why would a villain
kill another villain?

08:18.562 --> 08:20.197
Well, I mean,
they're not exactly

08:20.230 --> 08:21.865
the most stable people
to begin with

08:21.899 --> 08:24.935
and I'm starting to think
you might be right.

08:24.968 --> 08:28.872
They could all be
in Blue Valley.

08:28.906 --> 08:31.274
I just don't know why,

08:31.307 --> 08:34.076
or who they could be.

08:34.110 --> 08:37.279
Did any of them
play the violin?

08:37.312 --> 08:40.250
Yeah, the Fiddler.

08:40.250 --> 08:44.086
Brace yourself, Pat.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.288
I think Principal Bowin
is the Fiddler.

08:46.322 --> 08:49.158
[chuckles] Yeah?

08:49.192 --> 08:52.260
First off,
the Fiddler was a man.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.764
Second, he was Irish.

08:54.798 --> 08:57.969
Okay, well, I saw her
playing the violin in like...

08:58.000 --> 09:02.172
-a super evil-looking way.
-Where?

09:02.172 --> 09:04.575
At the hospital.

09:04.606 --> 09:05.942
-In Brainwave's room.
-What?

09:05.975 --> 09:07.110
What were you doing there?

09:07.144 --> 09:08.913
I thought some of
Brainwave's visitors

09:08.946 --> 09:10.248
could be ISA members

09:10.248 --> 09:12.716
and sure enough,
Principal Bowin was
in his room,

09:12.750 --> 09:14.783
playing the violin.

09:14.783 --> 09:16.153
-Why would she do that?
-Court, I told you

09:16.153 --> 09:17.855
-specifically to stay away...
-Okay, well, let's...

09:17.855 --> 09:19.523
-from the hospital.
-Let's team back up.

09:19.557 --> 09:20.691
Or I can keep doing

09:20.725 --> 09:22.692
-your work for you.
-No.

09:22.725 --> 09:24.860
You are to do nothing.

09:24.894 --> 09:27.264
[bell ringing]

09:27.298 --> 09:28.966
-[both grunting]
-[indistinct chatter]

09:29.000 --> 09:31.466
Why did you bring
all this stuff to school?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.702
My mom was
going through my closet.

09:33.738 --> 09:37.139
[grunting]

09:37.173 --> 09:39.009
I think the Green Lantern
is stuck.

09:39.042 --> 09:40.240
[grunts]

09:46.984 --> 09:50.754
[suspenseful music playing]

09:50.788 --> 09:52.923
We have to ramp up
our search, Yolanda.

09:52.956 --> 09:55.994
We can't take on the entire
Injustice Society ourselves.

09:56.027 --> 09:57.662
-Who can we ask?
-[girl] Hey, Jared.

09:57.695 --> 09:59.296
Come on, let's go.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.398
What about Artemis Crock?

10:00.432 --> 10:02.767
She's the best athlete
in the whole school.

10:02.798 --> 10:04.769
I thought about her,
but she's too...

10:04.802 --> 10:07.471
[Artemis growls]

10:07.504 --> 10:09.173
-...competitive.
-Yeah.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.176
Oh, man. You should've seen
the look on your face.
I was awesome.

10:11.207 --> 10:14.644
We need someone with skills
and heroic traits.

10:14.677 --> 10:15.812
[Yolanda] Okay, question.

10:15.846 --> 10:18.216
If the ISA is a bunch
of murdering freaks,

10:18.216 --> 10:20.750
shouldn't we be looking
beyond Blue Valley High?

10:20.783 --> 10:22.320
We can't trust adults.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.320
Anyone in Blue Valley
could be a member
of the Injustice Society.

10:29.158 --> 10:32.196
Whoa.

10:32.229 --> 10:33.663
Careful.

10:33.697 --> 10:38.402
There are dragons in the water.

10:38.433 --> 10:42.639
[chuckles]

10:42.673 --> 10:45.975
[man 1] <i>He walks up the steps,</i>
<i>it'll probably be him.</i>

10:46.009 --> 10:48.647
[man 2] <i>What do you suppose</i>
<i>they call him for short?</i>

10:48.678 --> 10:52.099
[man 1] <i>Well,</i>
<i>his first name's Christopher.</i>
<i>Probably Chris.</i>

11:05.831 --> 11:08.099
-[man 3] <i>Hey, Chris.</i>
-They're hauling it
tomorrow night.

11:08.130 --> 11:11.134
[Sharpe] The all five,
six broadcasting dish. Ooh.

11:11.168 --> 11:14.072
The truck is taking Route 74,
departs at 8:00.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.572
[indistinct chatter]

11:16.572 --> 11:20.442
Very good.

11:20.475 --> 11:23.547
What about my payment?

11:23.581 --> 11:27.649
Yes, of course.

11:27.683 --> 11:31.623
Well deserved, my boy.

11:31.654 --> 11:36.654
I hope this helps with those
pesky alimony payments.

11:38.894 --> 11:41.465
Oh...

11:41.498 --> 11:42.998
And a tip.

11:47.038 --> 11:49.273
It's chocolate.

11:49.306 --> 11:51.642
Imported.

11:51.673 --> 11:53.475
From France.

12:01.384 --> 12:03.253
[chuckles] Oh.

12:03.253 --> 12:05.623
[exhales]

12:05.654 --> 12:06.923
-[Pat] Dang it.
-[car sputtering]

12:06.923 --> 12:07.825
[Courtney] What happened?

12:07.825 --> 12:09.192
I don't know.

12:09.225 --> 12:11.028
I thought you were
a professional mechanic.

12:11.062 --> 12:14.331
-[car sputtering]
-Have you ever even
fixed a car?

12:14.365 --> 12:18.567
I'm gonna need you
to start the car when
I say "when," okay?

12:18.567 --> 12:19.567
Okay.

12:30.047 --> 12:31.849
Okay, give it a try, Court.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.519
I thought you were
going to say "when."

12:36.552 --> 12:37.788
When.

12:37.822 --> 12:39.056
[car sputtering]

12:39.090 --> 12:41.057
[Rick] Sounds like
the alternator.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.460
Yeah, that's right.

12:42.494 --> 12:45.899
You know cars or at least
you got a good ear for 'em.

12:48.630 --> 12:49.700
I work on cars.

12:49.731 --> 12:51.769
-Oh.
-Well, a car.

12:51.802 --> 12:53.802
What do you got going?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.609
'66 Mustang.

12:57.642 --> 12:59.808
Just need a carburetor,
I'll get it up and running.

12:59.844 --> 13:04.715
'66 Mustang,
that's a great ride.

13:04.748 --> 13:06.884
-My dad had one.
-Really?

13:06.917 --> 13:09.952
You don't seem them
around that often.

13:09.985 --> 13:11.687
What color?

13:11.721 --> 13:15.192
Yellow.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.095
Huh.

13:17.095 --> 13:18.095
[suspenseful music playing]

13:18.096 --> 13:19.529
[muffled ringing]

13:19.562 --> 13:24.562
[Pat] Yeah, that's the problem
right there. Thank you.

13:28.605 --> 13:30.942
Yeah, that's what I was
trying to loosen right there,

13:30.975 --> 13:33.975
'cause I think
it was clogging that up.

13:39.649 --> 13:42.500
[hourglass buzzing]

13:51.662 --> 13:54.360
[Pat] Right there.

13:59.302 --> 14:03.639
[Rick grunts] Okay.
I think that's it.

14:03.639 --> 14:06.543
Pat Dugan, by the way.

14:06.576 --> 14:10.148
I'm Rick Harris.

14:10.181 --> 14:11.447
Mind giving me a hand, Rick?

14:11.481 --> 14:16.451
I'm gonna try and push it
down the street.

14:16.485 --> 14:17.485
Sorry.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.408
[hourglass buzzing]

14:37.509 --> 14:39.808
What do you know
about that kid?

14:39.844 --> 14:41.745
-Him?
-Yeah.

14:41.778 --> 14:44.947
Nothing. Why?

14:44.980 --> 14:47.118
No reason.

14:47.149 --> 14:52.100
Well, uh,
I guess I'll just walk.

14:53.822 --> 14:54.923
Good luck.

14:54.957 --> 14:59.009
[suspenseful music playing]

15:03.100 --> 15:06.100
[indistinct chatter]

15:33.000 --> 15:35.392
Why are you following me?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.301
I need to talk to you.

15:42.572 --> 15:43.575
Wait.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.009
I just need to show you
something, okay?

15:45.009 --> 15:47.945
It's hard to explain, but...

15:47.976 --> 15:50.913
Look at this.

15:50.947 --> 15:54.850
It's an hourglass. So what?

15:54.884 --> 15:58.783
It was going crazy before.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.195
-Something's wrong.
-Yeah, something's wrong.

16:04.195 --> 16:09.195
-Yeah.
-You should stay on your meds.

16:14.705 --> 16:17.206
[doorbell ringing]

16:17.240 --> 16:22.240
Hmm, a bit early
for trick-or-treaters.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.082
Hello.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.253
What are you supposed to be?

16:29.287 --> 16:32.089
I'm a friend of Courtney's.

16:32.123 --> 16:34.057
-A friend?
-Beth Chapel.

16:34.091 --> 16:36.027
-Oh.
-Ooh.

16:36.058 --> 16:37.293
KitKats.

16:37.326 --> 16:38.864
-[door closes]
-[Beth] Normally,
at this time,

16:38.897 --> 16:41.499
I'd be planning
a fun evening activity
to enjoy with my parents.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.432
My parents and I love
all the same things.

16:43.466 --> 16:45.970
But our first hobby was ants.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.171
-Ants?
-Yeah.

16:47.171 --> 16:48.706
Before my parents got
so busy with work

16:48.706 --> 16:51.109
we had this huge ant farm
which was a replica
of Manhattan.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.312
I voted for Paris,
but Dad said our ants
wouldn't understand French.

16:54.345 --> 16:55.745
Isn't that the funniest thing?

16:55.745 --> 16:57.447
-Yeah.
-[Beth] He's the comedian
of the family. [chuckles]

16:57.480 --> 17:00.317
Ants, they're like a total
and complete mini society,

17:00.350 --> 17:01.519
working for the greater good.

17:01.552 --> 17:03.553
Oh, we used to have
a roach farm too.

17:03.586 --> 17:05.588
-But then all of those got--
-Oh, wow, would you
look at the time.

17:05.588 --> 17:07.392
I have to get ready
for this trick-or-treaters.

17:07.392 --> 17:09.259
Would you mind waiting
in the living room?

17:09.291 --> 17:13.491
-Sure.
-[Barbara] Thank you.

17:23.772 --> 17:25.608
Mrs. Whitmore

17:25.643 --> 17:28.542
Is the dog supposed to be
chewing on that?

17:32.250 --> 17:36.987
Come here, doggy.

17:37.019 --> 17:38.671
Good doggy.

18:10.185 --> 18:13.391
So this is the room
of a superhero. Hm.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.522
[mask buzzing]

18:30.508 --> 18:33.876
-[goggles whirring]
-[Beth] Oh.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.680
-[goggles beeping]
-[Dr. McNider] <i>Good afternoon.</i>

18:40.651 --> 18:41.741

How do you know everything?

19:12.517 --> 19:14.050
[Dr. McNider]
<i>I don't know everything.</i>

19:14.085 --> 19:16.988

19:25.229 --> 19:26.564
[Beth] Uh, okay.

19:26.564 --> 19:28.766
Why are you talking about
yourself in the third person?

19:28.766 --> 19:31.537
[Dr. McNider] <i>I am merely</i>
an A.I. of Dr. Charles McNider.

19:35.506 --> 19:37.074
Don't change a thing.

19:37.105 --> 19:38.674
You do you, Chuck.

19:38.710 --> 19:43.710
Oh, do you mind
if I call you Chuck?

19:44.114 --> 19:46.384
Sharp objects coming through.

19:46.415 --> 19:50.319
[chuckles] Say hello
to the family.

19:50.354 --> 19:51.654
You are a disturbed little man.

19:51.689 --> 19:56.689
I appreciate it. Uh, I think
your friend's upstairs.

19:58.996 --> 20:01.029
[Beth laughing]

20:01.065 --> 20:02.266
What are you doing in my room?

20:02.298 --> 20:03.800
[gasps] Oh, Chuck,
tell me about her.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.237
[Dr. McNider]

20:09.074 --> 20:11.776
These things are like Wikipedia
on rocket fuel.

20:11.808 --> 20:13.178
I wonder what else it could do.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.144
-[Dr. McNider]
<i>What else can I do?</i>
-Take those off.

20:15.179 --> 20:16.646
[gasps]

20:16.681 --> 20:18.382
[Dr. McNider]
<i>I am able to shift</i>

<i>infrared and night vision.</i>

20:21.550 --> 20:23.788
-This is so bonkers.
-The goggles are just

20:23.820 --> 20:25.521
something my stepdad
is working on.

20:25.556 --> 20:27.826
False. These were invented
by Dr. Charles McNider

20:27.857 --> 20:30.094
after he lost his sight
fighting the mob.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.663
They helped a blind man see.

20:31.694 --> 20:34.766
He put on a mask
and became Dr. Mid-Nite.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.432
Later joining
the Justice Society of America.

20:36.432 --> 20:37.535
Give me those, right now.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.403
And I know that
you're a superhero too.

20:40.438 --> 20:41.570
What?

20:41.605 --> 20:43.941
I saw you last night
at the hospital. Flying!

20:43.972 --> 20:46.611
That's crazy...

20:46.644 --> 20:48.644
and that wasn't me.

20:48.644 --> 20:50.346
And you shouldn't even be
in my room right now,

20:50.346 --> 20:53.150
I don't even know you.

20:53.182 --> 20:54.852
Um...

20:54.884 --> 20:56.452
Well...

20:56.487 --> 20:59.355
A, we eat lunch
together every day,

20:59.390 --> 21:01.625
and B, last night
at the hospital

21:01.659 --> 21:03.362
I heard you call Yolanda
by her real name.

21:03.394 --> 21:05.695
[Dr. McNider] <i>That is a common</i>
<i>rookie superhero mistake.</i>

21:05.730 --> 21:08.664
Chuck says it's a common
rookie superhero mistake.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.424
It got someone named
the Red Bee killed.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.240
Beth, let's sit down.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.843
Look, this is all top secret.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.746
You can't tell anybody.
Nobody at school,
not your parents--

21:21.746 --> 21:23.512
I don't really keep secrets
from my parents.

21:23.512 --> 21:24.780
Do you want them to die?

21:24.816 --> 21:26.983
Because that's how you'll
get your parents killed.

21:27.018 --> 21:29.554
Secret identities
are superhero 101.

21:29.586 --> 21:32.954
They keep
the people you love safe.

21:32.954 --> 21:34.458
Now...

21:34.490 --> 21:35.727
before I let you go,

21:35.759 --> 21:37.862
I need to know
a little bit more about you...

21:37.894 --> 21:39.864
-[goggles beeping]
-[Beth] What were you doing
in West Farms?

21:39.896 --> 21:41.964
-[Courtney] What?
-The dirt on your shoes...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.733
they have...
farm fertilizer in them.

21:44.768 --> 21:46.103
Ew!

21:46.134 --> 21:47.673
Don't change the subject.

21:47.704 --> 21:52.704
[Beth] Rick Harris is
the only kid I know who lives
way out in West Farms.

21:53.375 --> 21:56.011
I mean...
that's what he calls himself.

21:56.046 --> 21:57.048
What do you mean?

21:57.082 --> 21:59.517
[Beth] Rick Harris's
real name is Rick Tyler.

21:59.548 --> 22:01.951
And Rick's dad's real name
is Rex Tyler.

22:01.983 --> 22:04.054
What?

22:04.086 --> 22:05.954
Rex Tyler?

22:05.989 --> 22:10.528
He was a superhero.

22:10.559 --> 22:14.699
Rick's dad was a superhero?

22:14.700 --> 22:17.034
Rick's dad was Hourman.

22:17.067 --> 22:20.665
[dramatic music playing]

22:42.526 --> 22:43.928
[Pat] Oh. Hi, sorry.

22:43.961 --> 22:46.895
This is the Harris
residence, right?

22:46.930 --> 22:48.332
[door closes]

22:48.365 --> 22:49.365
[Matt] Who are you?

22:49.365 --> 22:53.201
My name's Pat Dugan.

22:53.237 --> 22:56.204
Is Rick home?

22:56.240 --> 22:57.973
[sighs] What'd he do now?

22:58.008 --> 22:59.375
[Pat] Oh. Uh...

22:59.375 --> 23:00.375
He did nothing.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.913
Yeah, nothing my ass.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.480
I got someone up here
every other week
'cause of Rick, all right.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.147
So, uh...

23:05.182 --> 23:07.352
I'm sorry, you're his, uh...

23:07.352 --> 23:08.352
Dad.

23:08.352 --> 23:09.487
His dad.

23:09.519 --> 23:11.520
Right. Okay.

23:11.555 --> 23:13.288
So anyhow the Mustang...

23:13.324 --> 23:14.692
[Matt] What about it?

23:14.726 --> 23:17.028
[Pat] It's a '66, right?
It's a helluva a car.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.096
I bet you're both excited
about fixing it up.

23:19.130 --> 23:24.130
Why would I care about
that piece of junk?

23:24.535 --> 23:26.037
[Pat] It's a carburetor.

23:26.069 --> 23:29.807
Rick had mentioned
he needed one, I had
one lying around.

23:29.839 --> 23:31.576
Figured I'd drop it off and...

23:31.607 --> 23:33.277
Yeah. I'll give it to him.

23:33.308 --> 23:35.711
Okay.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.448
Sorry to disturb you.

23:37.448 --> 23:38.448

-Oh, yeah.

23:42.618 --> 23:45.588
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

23:45.588 --> 23:46.588
Let's get it.

23:46.588 --> 23:47.592
[Brian] Come on.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.425
I get paid first.

23:49.425 --> 23:50.425
How much?

23:50.426 --> 23:51.863
One hundred. Each.

23:51.894 --> 23:54.198
No way, bro.
These go for fifty a piece--

23:54.230 --> 23:55.598
Inflation, bro.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.000
It's three hundred.

23:57.035 --> 23:59.537
Maybe I just take 'em off
your hands and free them.

23:59.568 --> 24:02.506
Or maybe I break your arms.

24:02.538 --> 24:06.140
[dramatic music playing]

24:12.784 --> 24:16.084
Yeah. Chill out, dude.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.624
[Brian] Argh, it's heavy.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.522
[Travis] Yeah.

24:20.522 --> 24:21.726
Dude that kid is crazy.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.492
[Brian] He definitely
would've broken your arm.

24:23.492 --> 24:24.493
[Travis] Yeah, probably.

24:27.163 --> 24:31.000
[laughing]

24:31.035 --> 24:36.035
I can't believe
how much Mr. Keegan owes
on his house.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.241
When you called and said
you'd found a new recruit

24:38.276 --> 24:42.046
I wasn't exactly expecting
Beth Chapel.

24:42.078 --> 24:44.381
Why did you chose her to be
the new Captain Midnight?

24:44.413 --> 24:45.750
Dr. Mid-nite.

24:45.781 --> 24:47.018
I didn't choose her.

24:47.049 --> 24:49.220
She just found the goggles
and got them working.

24:49.252 --> 24:51.221
And she hasn't
stopped talking ever since.

24:51.256 --> 24:55.000
Oh, it's well known
that talking is Beth Chapel's
super-power.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It's true.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.827
Okay. So you wanna
find Rick...

24:57.862 --> 24:59.931
Chuck tracked his phone...
from his house

24:59.962 --> 25:01.530
to a liquor store on Highway 4

25:01.565 --> 25:03.666
to Cindy Burman's house.

25:03.701 --> 25:06.336
There are 116 people
at this location.

25:06.368 --> 25:08.305
99.1% are minors.

Okay, narc.

25:14.144 --> 25:16.645
I'm going home.
This is a bad idea.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.516
Don't go, Yolanda.

25:18.548 --> 25:20.218
This is a huge deal.

25:20.250 --> 25:23.385
Rick's like me.
His dad was a member
of the JSA.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.586
He's a legacy!

25:24.586 --> 25:26.222
This is beyond exciting!

25:26.257 --> 25:31.257
Okay. Well, I'm not
going in there.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.164
I'll go find Rick.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.300
I'll help.

[Cindy] What are you wearing?

27:32.250 --> 27:34.317
I thought you'd like it
if we matched.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.318
You're joking?

27:35.353 --> 27:37.086
You're basically me
for Halloween.

27:37.121 --> 27:39.623
If I was shorter
and fifteen pounds heavier.

27:39.655 --> 27:40.723
Ew.

27:40.758 --> 27:43.156
-But...
-Change.

-Hey.
-Hi.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.009
[Cindy] You haven't said
anything about my costume.

What?

28:05.480 --> 28:06.451
It's loud in here.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.684
[Cindy] Yeah. It's supposed
to be loud.

28:08.719 --> 28:10.452
What's your problem lately?

28:10.487 --> 28:13.525
You've been kind of a drag.

28:13.557 --> 28:17.728
My problem
is that my dad is
in the hospital, Cindy.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.730
Maybe you should go
visit him then.

28:19.762 --> 28:24.300
Hospitals are quiet.

28:24.335 --> 28:27.636
Oh, my God,
you're so sensitive.

your real name is Rick Tyler.

29:13.817 --> 29:14.817
What?

29:18.855 --> 29:23.355
Your dad's name was Rex Tyler.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.933
He was Hourman.

29:30.968 --> 29:34.172
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:34.203 --> 29:35.506
Let me find the others.

29:35.538 --> 29:37.307
[Rick] The others?

29:37.342 --> 29:41.010
So, you think
you're all superheroes, huh?

29:41.045 --> 29:44.682
So you're Stargirl.

29:44.713 --> 29:46.616
-You're...
-Wildcat.

29:46.651 --> 29:51.651
-And she's--
-Just borrowing those
for the night.

29:52.655 --> 29:55.960
[Rick] Right. So, what can
this "magic" hourglass do?

29:55.991 --> 29:57.528
It's science.

29:57.528 --> 29:59.230
Your dad invented it.

29:59.262 --> 30:01.432
[Beth] The hourglass
gave your dad super strength.

30:01.463 --> 30:03.534
For one hour a day.

30:03.567 --> 30:04.634
One hour?

30:04.669 --> 30:07.770
So the other 23 hours
he was what, just some dude?

30:07.805 --> 30:09.673
He was a brilliant chemist!

30:09.708 --> 30:12.210
[scoffs] Y'know that hourglass
only worked for your dad.

30:12.241 --> 30:16.114
It was tied to his DNA.

30:16.145 --> 30:18.414
How do you turn it on?

30:18.450 --> 30:20.817
[Beth] How do you use
any hourglass?

30:20.851 --> 30:23.054
You turn it over.

30:23.086 --> 30:26.685
[dramatic music playing]

30:57.922 --> 30:59.387

31:29.354 --> 31:30.653
[Courtney] Hey, you...

31:30.653 --> 31:32.757
You really shouldn't test out
your powers in public.

31:32.757 --> 31:36.794
-Our identities--
-Protecting them
is Superhero 101.

31:36.826 --> 31:38.229
And you need a costume.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.930
Technically, we all do.

31:39.930 --> 31:40.931
Since it's Halloween.

31:40.963 --> 31:42.467
I'm not wearing
a stupid costume.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.634
You guys,
do whatever you want.

31:44.666 --> 31:45.903
I'm doing my own thing.

31:45.935 --> 31:48.939
-Hey! You can't just take
the hourglass like--
-Yes, I can!

31:48.971 --> 31:50.208
It was my dad's, right?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.673
Now it's mine.

-[Yolanda] Congrats.

31:58.749 --> 31:59.950
I'm not giving up, yet.

31:59.982 --> 32:01.384
We can still get through
to him.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.287
[Yolanda] Seems like
he's done listening.

32:03.319 --> 32:05.056
And how do we make him?

32:05.087 --> 32:06.824
We can't when we're
dressed like this.

32:06.855 --> 32:10.326
Oh. Let's go suit up!

32:11.200 --> 32:13.663
Thanks, Beth,
but we'll take it from here.

32:13.663 --> 32:14.566

give you my number.

where are you going?
-Oh, my God. Matt.
