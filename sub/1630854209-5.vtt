My name is Regina Haywood.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.473
We, all together,

00:05.573 --> 00:07.108
are going to stem
this violence

00:07.208 --> 00:08.409
in East New York.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.743
<i>Why'd you volunteer to do this,
Quinlan?</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:11.412

this is a good idea.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.149

going on a month.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.517
If we buy this
place, we should

00:16.617 --> 00:18.018
do something different
with the bar menu,

00:18.119 --> 00:20.388
you know, like not the
usual nachos and sliders.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.124
I need to see your apartment.
Please tell me that lame-ass
line has never worked before,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.193

no game whatso...

00:25.293 --> 00:26.660
Pump the brakes, Brandy.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.928
I'm taking the other
unit in Ruskin Gardens,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.230

Aah!

00:50.118 --> 00:51.419

Green Haven
Correctional Facility.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.607
Lamonte Jacobs.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.475
Do you accept the charges?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.610
Yes.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.547
Hello, Regina.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.919
Quinlan. Hey. Yeah.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.821
The guys and I are
headed to Goody's for a
drink. You want to join?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.590
Oh, no, I already got plans. Sorry.
Oh, yeah?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.125
Hot date?
Yeah.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.360
I'm gonna grab some Chinese food

01:32.460 --> 01:33.427
from my favorite place
around the corner.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.563
Crawl into bed,
watch TV

01:35.663 --> 01:37.531
and, if I'm lucky,
I am asleep by 10:00.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.799
Add in a cat and a Snuggie

01:38.899 --> 01:40.501
and you're my
75-year-old grandmother.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.002
Okay, you can mock it all
you want, but, you know what,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.471
I am getting eight hours
of uninterrupted sleep tonight.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.072
Okay. Rain check?
Sure.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.241
All right.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.242
<i>To what do I owe</i>

01:48.342 --> 01:49.677
this honor, Lamonte?

01:49.777 --> 01:52.613
It's been a long time
since I heard your voice.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.515
Lieutenant Haywood.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.451
It's "Deputy Inspector Haywood"
now.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.387
You know, I miss our talks.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.289
Today is

02:01.389 --> 02:02.290
a special day.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.724
How so?
You know

02:03.824 --> 02:06.327
the Court of Appeals
shut me down.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.529
Last month.
I did hear that, yeah.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.431
Stare decisis.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.700
All that time spent
in the prison library

02:12.800 --> 02:15.369
trying to prove
prosecutorial misconduct,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.205
witness tampering.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.608
You managed to learn
a thing or two about the law.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.110
Yeah, but I still lost,
didn't I?

02:23.211 --> 02:24.512
I'm sure that's

02:24.612 --> 02:26.714
a hard thing
for a man like you to accept.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.183
It was. But, you know,
today, I had a breakthrough.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.851
Is that so?
Yeah.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.687
You know, I realized I was
looking at this loss all wrong.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.089
It's actually a victory,
is what it is.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.191
How so?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.192
I'm free.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.593
I'm not angry anymore.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.762
Restitution...

02:41.862 --> 02:44.832
is the name of the game
from now on.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.435
I wanted

02:47.535 --> 02:48.702
to thank you

03:37.851 --> 03:39.186

you guys

03:39.287 --> 03:40.321
to please turn down the music.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.022
In that case, no.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.123
Cop.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.892
Come on, I'm asking nicely.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.894
What's so nice about you
barging into our living room

03:46.994 --> 03:48.596
without so much as a knock
on the door?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.298
Last I checked,
this is the front yard.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.332
Exactly.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.633
Our living room.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.801
Hey-o, hey-o.
Look, look, look.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.968
What you about to do?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.771
Seriously?
What you about to do?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.410
And I got more, too.
Guys, come on,

04:02.510 --> 04:03.877
people have work in the morning,

04:03.977 --> 04:05.212
and they need to get
a good night's sleep.
Aw!

04:05.313 --> 04:07.281
Yet you the only one
out here complaining.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.916
Cop.
Ooh.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.351
Oops.
Ooh!

04:10.451 --> 04:11.552
My bad.
Oh, she wild

04:11.652 --> 04:12.820
for that. She
crazy for that.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.987
She wild right now.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.956
Look at her face.
You know what?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.224
I am a cop.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.559
And I'm writing you
a desk appearance ticket.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.827
For what?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.363
Well, that was
a noise code violation.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.097
And I'm guessing
you're under 21,

04:24.197 --> 04:26.634
which means
that you three smartasses

04:26.734 --> 04:28.369
have been furnishing
a minor with alcohol,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.938
which is a misdemeanor offense
with a $250 fine attached.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.873
Yo, you're really
a bitch-ass cop.
For real.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.676
Keep on talking
and I'll write you one, too.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.877
Get going off somewhere.
Like, watch out.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.612
Go get it. Go get
the ticket, cop.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.414
Move it.
Who cares?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.915
Oink, oink!
Bye!

04:42.015 --> 04:44.017
It was not my idea!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.619
It was <i>so</i>
your idea.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.720
Ann. Excuse me.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.821
Ann, back me up.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.490
It was your idea. Boom.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.891
Traitor.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.259
"It's Montell Jordan, guys!"

04:52.360 --> 04:53.661
No.
"Ooh! Boys II Men!

04:53.761 --> 04:54.895
Oh, we have to
get backstage!"

04:54.995 --> 04:56.730
You were desperate
to meet Nathan Morris.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.500
Yes. Montell, too!
Montell, too!
Oh, my gosh.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.834
And Sabrina was

05:00.934 --> 05:02.736
the only one
you could convince... Oh.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.672
...to slide through that gate
that led to the backstage. Oh.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.774
Only for security to come
and kick us all out.

<i>Deputy Inspector Haywood,</i>

05:48.749 --> 05:50.651
U.S. Marshal
David Westlake.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.986
Lamonte Jacobs called you
from Green Haven

05:53.086 --> 05:55.288
Correctional Facility
earlier this evening.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.992
Do you typically accept
collect calls from inmates?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.429
When I think I might
get something from them,

06:01.529 --> 06:04.598
like a confession, um... sure.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.599
What was that
call about?

06:05.699 --> 06:06.634
About
a month ago,

06:06.734 --> 06:07.735
Jacobs lost his appeal.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.336
I was the cop who collared him.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.704
He wanted to let me know

06:10.804 --> 06:11.972
he finally accepted it.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.241
Seeing that prison calls
are recorded,

06:14.341 --> 06:15.443
you already know all this.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.344
So why are you here?

06:19.513 --> 06:20.481
Regina, when, uh,

06:20.581 --> 06:23.417
Jacobs hung up with you, he...

06:23.517 --> 06:25.786
went back to his cell
and faked a suicide attempt.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.955
Faked? What do you mean,
"faked"?

06:28.055 --> 06:30.290
He was being transported to
Vassar Brothers Medical Center

06:30.390 --> 06:32.292
when he broke free
of his restraints,

06:32.392 --> 06:35.128
and then he stabbed the EMT
and the ambulance driver.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.798
Jacobs is probably halfway
to Canada by now.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.200
Why the hell are you wasting
your time talking to me?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.102
What...
Except he's not.
Jacobs ditched

06:42.202 --> 06:43.871
the ambulance,
carjacked a Prius.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.839
We found the Prius
abandoned underneath

06:45.939 --> 06:48.375
the L train at
Livonia and Rockaway.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.143
Jacobs...

06:50.243 --> 06:52.212
is in East New York?

06:54.381 --> 06:56.083
Happy birthday, Regina.

07:06.994 --> 07:07.895
<i>Forensics is collecting</i>

07:07.995 --> 07:09.663
evidence on the Prius now.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.665
We should know more
within the hour.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.502
Both the ambulance driver
and the EMT

07:14.602 --> 07:17.805
were killed with a blade from
a razor he must've smuggled out.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.673
This prison break didn't
just happen on the fly.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.941
So my guess is,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.743
the second
Jacobs lost his appeal,

07:22.843 --> 07:23.944
he put his plan into motion.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.213
So the EMT and
the ambulance driver

07:26.313 --> 07:28.549
are only going to be the
first of many casualties

07:28.649 --> 07:29.750
we're going to see.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.018
We set up a hotline--

07:31.118 --> 07:32.720
calls are
already rolling in--

07:32.820 --> 07:34.722
as well
as a social media page

07:34.822 --> 07:36.857
asking the public to post
any intel they have.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.291
We got every precinct

07:38.391 --> 07:40.260
in the borough sending
additional resources as well.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.261
Good.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.363
We're gonna need them.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
You think
she had a hot date?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.003
Aren't you the one
always telling me

07:50.103 --> 07:51.672
mind my own damn business?
Can't remember

07:51.772 --> 07:53.641
the last time
I was on a date.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.043
Guess I'm living vicariously.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.847
You smell
like a damn brewery.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.248
I had a couple of beers
at the end of my shift.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.283
I wasn't expecting
to get called back in.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.218
None of us did.
All right, everyone.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.020
Lamonte Jacobs is
one of the biggest,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.990
baddest drug kingpins
Brooklyn has ever seen.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.125
Bed-Stuy, Brownsville,
Crown Heights,

08:12.225 --> 08:13.827
Cypress Hill and East New York.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.096
His reach was far and wide.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.131
Oh, boy,
is this really happening?
In 2017,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.067
when I was a lieutenant
at the 7-3,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.969
I collared Lamonte Jacobs

08:22.069 --> 08:25.172
for the murder of rival
drug dealer Carlos Sanchez.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.241
Jacobs was serving a
life sentence in prison

08:28.341 --> 08:31.311
without parole at Green Haven
Correctional Facility,

08:31.411 --> 08:32.580
where he escaped.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.914
Any idea why he'd risk
getting pinched

08:34.014 --> 08:35.415
by making a pit stop
in East New York?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.951
Money. Passports. Help
getting across the border.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.887
Lamonte
might have been locked up,

08:39.987 --> 08:42.590
but his associates
still have skin in the game.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.324
Okay. So who's helping him?

08:44.424 --> 08:46.526
We have a few initial leads
that we're working on right now.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.527
I knew Jacobs

08:47.628 --> 08:48.829
from back in the day.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.230
I see you have his baby mama,
Ava Martinez,

08:50.330 --> 08:52.232
and their son, Drew Jacobs',
photo on the board.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.001
Do you think
Ava might be helping him?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.268
Ava eventually married.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.970
She and Drew moved
to Stony Brook.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.006
We have local PD en route
to her home right now.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.341
That's one hell
of a wake-up call.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.043
And it's not
just business associates

09:03.143 --> 09:04.745
and family we need
to be worried about.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.680
Lamonte Jacobs
wasn't your average

09:06.780 --> 09:08.081
drug-pushing dealer.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.117
This man took care
of his East New York community.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.585
Paid for people's rents
when they were

09:11.685 --> 09:14.554
being evicted,
he gave money to public schools.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.758
And he had a bunch of businesses
that were legit.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.927
At least two
still exist today.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.228
So be careful.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.930
A lot of people
in the community,

09:23.030 --> 09:24.798
they look at him as a
drug dealer with a heart.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.133
Mm. That's an oxymoron.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.602
Which is why, until
we capture Jacobs,

09:28.702 --> 09:30.570
we rule out no one.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.773
U.S. Marshal
David Westlake,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.608
he'll take it from here.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.010
Chief. Captain.
All right.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.379
The U.S. Marshals Office
has already notified

09:39.479 --> 09:41.949
major airports,
buses, Border Patrol.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.885
We need you to put the word out
on the street.

09:44.985 --> 09:48.889
Contacts can be
incredibly helpful.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.123
So lean on them.
All right.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.358
You heard the marshal.
Let's get to work!

09:51.458 --> 09:53.226
Let's put the word out
on the street!

09:53.326 --> 09:54.294
Do some leaning!

09:54.394 --> 09:55.262
<i>Stan, where are we</i>

09:55.362 --> 09:57.397
with tracking down Ava and Drew?

09:57.497 --> 09:59.332
Ava's cell went straight
to voice mail.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.668
Local PD knocked.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.735
Nobody home.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.770
That's never a good sign.

10:02.870 --> 10:03.937
Find out if Ava's mom

10:04.037 --> 10:05.305
is still alive.
She and Drew

10:05.405 --> 10:06.774
might've gone to her house
for the night.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.208
What about Ava's work?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.010
She owns a salon in the city.
Opens at 8:00.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.112
I'll go by the salon
before heading to Green Haven.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.481
If she doesn't know
about Jacobs' escape,

10:14.581 --> 10:15.949
I want to be the one
to tell her.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.018
Okay, Regina, but...
Detective Killian,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.553
I know it's his day off,
but he's gonna have to...
He's my next call.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.055
Okay, and in the meantime,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.423
let Detective Morales
know she's riding with me.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.725
Regina.
Chief,

10:24.825 --> 10:26.326
I'm two steps ahead of you.
I got a car

10:26.426 --> 10:28.696
on my house, but I really
don't think Jacobs

10:28.796 --> 10:29.763
is in East New York for me.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.498
He called you before he escaped.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.466
Jacobs isn't
some thug drug dealer.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.935
He's a businessman.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.804
He's smart, calculated.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.471
I've studied him
for years.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.141
It's not in his DNA
to go after the cop.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.576
Okay, the second
this thing get hairy...

10:43.677 --> 10:45.145
I promise I will let you know.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.413
Now if you don't mind,

10:46.513 --> 10:48.115
I'd like to change
without an audience.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.217
Okay.
Stan?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.519
Can you put this in the fridge
with my name on it?

10:52.619 --> 10:53.987
Yeah.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.456
Red velvet, my favorite.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.926
Don't even think about it.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.360
Stan!

11:00.460 --> 11:02.095
Looks good.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.098
♪ Uh, the money don't stop ♪

11:05.198 --> 11:07.067
♪ Going hard
until we reach the top ♪

11:07.167 --> 11:08.936
♪ Hot joints,
you know we got guap ♪

11:09.036 --> 11:10.437
♪ Pull up on the lot ♪

11:10.537 --> 11:11.905
♪ Cop something
you know you couldn't cop ♪

11:19.046 --> 11:21.882
Is that my underwear?!

11:21.982 --> 11:23.616
Pig!

11:23.717 --> 11:25.085
That's my Stones shirt!

11:28.889 --> 11:30.758
Serves you right.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.225
Excuse me?

11:32.325 --> 11:33.827
Ticketing
those tenants.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.128
Shame on you.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.629
Well, they were being disrespectful.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.631
No, they weren't. You were.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.134
Well, I'm sorry
you see it that way.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.036
I'm not
the only one.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.105
No one wants you here.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.606
You're a nuisance.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.476
Treating us like witnesses
in your little investigations

11:49.576 --> 11:52.813
or ticketing us
like criminals in our homes.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.482
Leave.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.027
<i>You don't seem surprised
about Lamonte's escape.</i>

12:07.127 --> 12:08.762
Lamonte has been
looking for a way out

12:08.862 --> 12:10.197
since the day he went in.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.731
Still, it takes a lot
of hubris and help

12:11.832 --> 12:13.934
to think you can pull
off a prison break.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.368
My ex has both.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.337
And I'm sure him losing
his appeal gave him

12:17.437 --> 12:19.672
all the ammunition he needed
to bust out of there.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.108
You knew he lost
the appeal?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.442
He asked me to write a letter

12:22.542 --> 12:23.944
to the Court of Appeals
on his behalf.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.712
Did you?
Yes.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.181
So you were hoping he'd get out?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.718
No, but, my ex still
has people on the outside.

12:31.819 --> 12:35.055
I felt I had a better chance
of seeing my son's 11th birthday

12:35.155 --> 12:36.824
if I played ball.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.992
Is that why you two
are here?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.127
You think I helped
Lamonte escape?

12:40.227 --> 12:42.095
Nobody is saying that.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.663
Mommy?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.199
I'm thirsty.
Can I have some soda?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.868
There are juice boxes
in the fridge, baby.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.404
Chips?
Grandma will be here soon
to take you to brunch.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.311
Where were you
this morning?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.213
Cops knocked,
no one was home.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.482
My husband was
out of town on business.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.918
So Drew and I stayed
at my friend Shellie's house.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.954
You're free to call her.
We will.

13:07.054 --> 13:10.023
Was the letter the last time
you talked to Lamonte?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.758
No. After he lost his appeal,

13:11.859 --> 13:13.660
he wanted me to bring Drew
to see him.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.195
He wanted to say goodbye.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.697
You didn't think that was odd?
The kid's ten years old.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.167
Lamonte wanted Drew
to have a normal life.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.902
He didn't want him
to be burdened by the fact

13:22.002 --> 13:24.337
that his father was behind bars.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.772
Looking back...

13:25.873 --> 13:27.640
Looking back,
did Lamonte

13:27.740 --> 13:29.642
mention anybody
who's still in the game

13:29.742 --> 13:32.679
who might've helped him escape
or help him now that he's out?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.548
No.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.787
Detective Morales,
why don't you give us a minute?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.560
Can you help me with this?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.129
Mm-hmm.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.445
So Jacobs was
your white whale?
Yeah.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.614
It got me promoted to
lieutenant, special assignment.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.649
Promotion like that comes
with a lot more money.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.185
Money has its perks,
but Jacobs is a ruthless killer.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.321
It was about getting him
off the street.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.790
Wait, this is addressed
to Lamonte Jacobs,

14:17.891 --> 14:21.361
but there's no return address.
Let's see.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.497
My son has a bike like this.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.766
The second I took off
the training wheels,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.301
he broke his arm.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.303
My ex still brings it up
every time we fight.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.305
Whoa, you have a son?
How old is he?

14:32.405 --> 14:35.208
Seven going on 17. Wow.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.480
Do you think that bird is
Jacobs fleeing the coop?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.149
I'm not sure.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.750
You get anything from Ava?

14:43.850 --> 14:45.318
Just that she's happily married
and her husband

14:45.418 --> 14:46.954
very much loves her son.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.856
I don't think she has anything
to do with Jacobs' escape.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.024
You believe her?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.392
I do.
'Cause she wouldn't be

14:52.492 --> 14:54.327
the first woman
to go back to an ex.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.263
You know
how many times

14:56.363 --> 14:59.666
I went back to my ex, before
I finally ended it for good?

14:59.766 --> 15:01.068
Yeah?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.802
When there's a kid involved,
it complicates things.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.872
Well, there are U.S. Marshals
on the salon and Ava's home.

15:05.973 --> 15:09.276
So if he goes anywhere
near them, we'll know it.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.845
<i>"The Doctrine of Star--"?</i>
No.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.414
<i>"Stare Decisis."</i>

15:14.514 --> 15:16.549
"To stand by things
decided."

15:16.649 --> 15:18.718
It's a legal principle
that determines

15:18.818 --> 15:20.853
points in litigation
based on precedent.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.323
Okay.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.658
Why would Jacobs be
reading this?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.861
Jacobs did everything he could
to overthrow the verdict.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.465
He's the kind of criminal who
looks from every single angle,

15:32.565 --> 15:36.103
so we really have to search this
place top to bottom, you know?

15:36.203 --> 15:37.870
Inspector?

15:37.971 --> 15:39.539
Yes?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.708
What?

15:41.808 --> 15:45.178
You sure Lamonte Jacobs isn't
in East New York for you?

15:57.024 --> 15:58.625
I'm thinking we should pull
you back from this case.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.293
Yeah, I can't disagree, Regina.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.195
We also might need some extra
security at your apartment.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.796
Maybe even put you up
at a hotel.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.432
I don't think
these news articles

16:05.532 --> 16:06.799
are about me. Hear me out.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.968
According
to the guards

16:09.069 --> 16:10.937
at Green Haven Correctional,
Jacobs spent

16:11.038 --> 16:13.306
most all of his time
in the prison library,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.375
going over his appeal.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.709
Poring through anything

16:16.809 --> 16:18.111
and everything he
could get his hands on.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.380
So you think that all
these news articles

16:20.480 --> 16:22.882
was Jacobs doing his due
diligence in regard to his case?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.185
Yes, the articles

16:25.285 --> 16:27.587
got me thinking
about who might have helped

16:27.687 --> 16:30.290
Jacobs escape, and who
is continuing to help him

16:30.390 --> 16:32.459
stay hidden
now that he's out.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.694
A lot of big players,
from back in the day,

16:34.794 --> 16:39.032
they showed up in support
of Jacobs during his trial.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.567
Look at that
right there.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.235
See that? Right there.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.439
Oh, wow, that's Moon and Bird. Yeah.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.276
Moon Sr. got clipped
shortly after Jacobs went in.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.511
Bird Sr., he's serving
time in Sing-Sing.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.981
Not seeing how a dead guy
and an incarcerated guy

16:55.082 --> 16:56.449
helped Jacobs escape.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.118
Okay. These men

16:58.218 --> 17:01.454
have sons
who are running things now

17:01.554 --> 17:03.790
that their daddies
are out of the picture.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.193
Alex Bird

17:06.293 --> 17:07.560
and James Moon.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.297
What's with that?
And this? It's the maple leaf.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.898
That's the symbol
on the Canadian flag.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.866
I think...

17:13.966 --> 17:15.968
Alex Bird...

17:16.069 --> 17:18.205
and James Moon
are helping Jacobs

17:18.305 --> 17:21.641
secure funds and a passport
before he heads to Canada.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.210
That's a hell
of a theory

17:23.310 --> 17:25.712
based on a picture
of a bird and a moon.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.648
We all know that prison cells
are routinely searched.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.984
So whoever sketched this drawing

17:32.085 --> 17:33.753
did it on the back
of this photo

17:33.853 --> 17:35.255
of Jacobs' son because

17:35.355 --> 17:37.690
they didn't want to send off
alarm bells to the guards

17:37.790 --> 17:39.959
that Jacobs was up
to something.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.229
If you're right, we got
to get this James Moon,

17:42.329 --> 17:45.332
this Alex Bird, and like
he says, lean on them hard.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.866
That's right. Yeah?

17:46.966 --> 17:49.269
Excuse me. Killian just got in. Great.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.571
Have him and Morales
talk to Pastor Rae.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.807
And have Bentley and Sandeford
talk to Alex Bird.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.609
Why-Why are we talking
to the pastor?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.711
Pastor Rae was the last person
who visited Jacobs

17:58.811 --> 18:00.213
before he broke out of jail.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.582
He might be able
to give us something

18:02.682 --> 18:04.117
that could help us
find Jacobs

18:04.217 --> 18:06.419
before he kills anyone else.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.526
Lamonte Jacobs escaped
from prison?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.228
It's the first time
I'm hearing about it.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.663
Come on, Bird,
it's hard to believe,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.064
considering that we know

18:18.165 --> 18:19.432
that Jacobs
called you at least four times

18:19.532 --> 18:20.900
last month
while he was still in prison.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.968
Last I checked,
talking to someone

18:22.068 --> 18:23.236
on the phone isn't a crime.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.071
Yeah, but harboring
a fugitive is.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.673
No, I'm not harboring anyone.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.242
Now unless you plan
on charging me for something...

18:29.342 --> 18:31.110
Hey, hey.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.246
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.849
Guess we're gonna have to sit
on him and wait to see

18:36.949 --> 18:38.084
if Jacobs
shows up.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.019
You see that box
that was just delivered?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.289
It contains ink tanks.
156 milliliter

18:42.389 --> 18:44.023
high-capacity ink tanks
to be exact.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.658
Which is definitely
not compatible

18:45.758 --> 18:47.794
with that printer
right there.

18:47.894 --> 18:48.861
Why you talking to me about ink?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.397
The only printer
I know of

18:50.497 --> 18:52.332
that requires that type of ink
is for making passports.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.467
And last I checked, the only
people that are supposed

18:54.567 --> 18:56.336
to be making passports work
at the Department of State.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.138
You're sure that's the ink?
I'm sure.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.440
I had an uncle that worked
at the Department of State.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.941
He took me
to work once to show me

19:02.041 --> 19:03.410
how they make passports.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.578
Bird has the capacity
to make fake passports.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.647
Could be why Jacobs
is in East New York.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.148
So we get a warrant?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.318
No, no, we need more than
ink to get a warrant.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.520
You got another uniform
in your locker?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.955
Yeah, why?

19:21.228 --> 19:23.596
I've never actually been
inside one of these.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.797
I've been in
a lot of them.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.065
Comprehensiveness
in conducting

19:26.165 --> 19:27.534
a search sometimes
requires it.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.503
Yeah, I can see where
that could be the case.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.738
Oh!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.072
It's not too attractive,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.307
the kind of things
you find in here though.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.142
It's good you elected
without being told

19:36.243 --> 19:37.810
to be the one going in.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.612
Shows character.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.681
That what it shows?
Also it's important

19:41.781 --> 19:44.050
that a police officer
is not easily nauseated.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.788
This it?

19:48.888 --> 19:49.956
Yeah, that's it.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.658
Drop it in there.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.260
Yeah.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.231
Oh, God.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.469
The Baptist Church of Hope was

20:02.569 --> 20:04.404
Lamonte's mother's second home.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.539
She was a Sunday
school teacher here.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.208
So when Lamonte asked me to come
visit him at Green Haven, I...

20:09.309 --> 20:11.878
I figured I owed it
to his mom, you know?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.714
God rest her soul.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.083
She passed away
last year.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.386
Oh, of course,
we understand that.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.888
Is there a more private place
we can talk?

20:21.988 --> 20:24.257
I really don't think I can
be much more help, Detective.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.693
Well, we just have
a few more questions.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.696
Uh, sure.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.066
<i>I still can't believe
Lamonte escaped.</i>

20:34.166 --> 20:35.935
Yeah, us, neither.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.937
Yeah, so, uh,
when you were visiting

20:38.037 --> 20:41.541
Lamonte at Green Haven, uh, did
he mention a friend or business

20:41.641 --> 20:45.044
associate he was, uh, still in
contact with in East New York?

20:45.144 --> 20:47.079
Gosh, uh, no.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.982
We mostly talked
about, uh, his appeal.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.352
He was in a dark place
when he lost,

20:52.452 --> 20:55.087
so he wanted me
to show him the light.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.923
He found the light all right. Yeah.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.227
What was that?
Uh...

21:01.328 --> 21:03.029
broken speaker.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.031
Got an electrician
back there working on it.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.899
I should probably
go check on him.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.702
Ah, it's cool. We'll wait.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.472
Um, you know, I've got
a sermon to prepare for.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.407
You seem awfully territorial
over that door.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.543
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.082
You hiding Jacobs?

21:23.182 --> 21:24.417
I'll call for backup!

21:24.517 --> 21:26.185
You're looking at aiding
and abetting, Pastor.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.355
Okay? So unless you want
your perp walk broadcast

21:28.455 --> 21:30.222
all over the 6:00 news,

21:30.323 --> 21:32.392
you better tell me
where the hell Jacobs went

21:32.492 --> 21:33.893
right now.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.565
Suspect is said
to be wearing a red hoodie,

21:38.665 --> 21:40.833
black jeans,
black and red sneakers.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.134
He is six-foot-two,

21:42.234 --> 21:43.970
approximately 195 pounds.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.572
He is armed and dangerous.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.307
Now you guys break off, go
search the side streets. Go now.

21:48.408 --> 21:52.712
All right, I'm gonna
need you to take a step back.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.515
Police.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.583
Stop!

21:56.683 --> 21:58.785
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Sir!

22:04.256 --> 22:05.958
What the--?!
Killian, Morales!

22:06.058 --> 22:07.293
On it!

22:07.394 --> 22:09.629
It's over!

22:12.264 --> 22:14.634
It's not Jacobs.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.436
It's James Moon.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.738
Yeah, we got
a decoy over here, too.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.841
Where is he? I know
you know where he is.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.510
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.144
I was just going for a run
when you jumped me.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.481
What the hell's going on, James?
Stand over here!

22:28.581 --> 22:31.117
What the hell did you do?
Shut up, cuz.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.656
The U.S. Marshals that were
sitting on Ava's salon are dead.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.726
And Ava and Drew?

22:43.496 --> 22:45.832
Is she gonna make it?
She lost a lot of blood.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.366
We won't know.
until she's in surgery.
Ava!

22:47.467 --> 22:49.201
Where's Drew? Did your
mother come get him?

22:49.301 --> 22:51.704
Lamonte took him, Regina.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.039
He has Drew.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.341
We got to move. Go, go!

23:06.519 --> 23:07.720
How the hell
did this happen?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.255
Wait a minute. Hey.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.123
This is the video camera

23:11.223 --> 23:13.259
from the salon.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.200
The kid appears
unharmed and seems

23:21.300 --> 23:22.835
to go willingly
with his dad.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.236
Any way we can
get the, uh, plates

23:24.336 --> 23:25.938
off of Jacobs'
getaway car there?

23:26.038 --> 23:28.007
We put out an
APB and an Amber Alert.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.842
All right, hey, Pastor Rae

23:29.942 --> 23:31.243
and James Moon lawyered up.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.979
You want us to keep
working them or what?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.848
I need a minute.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.287
Hey, hey.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.089
Come on, now, talk to me.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.458
What's going on?
Because if Ava dies...

23:45.558 --> 23:47.727
Ava dies,
that's not on you.

23:47.827 --> 23:48.961
That is not on you.
You couldn't have known

23:49.061 --> 23:50.362
what was gonna happen.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.632
I promised.

23:52.732 --> 23:55.234
I promised Ava that if Jacobs...

23:55.334 --> 23:56.769
Ava was your C.I.?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.337
I mean,
'cause there was no mention

23:58.437 --> 24:00.139
in any of Jacobs'
case files that I looked at,

24:00.239 --> 24:02.341
but I'd be surprised
if you didn't have one.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.710
It was Drew.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.813
It was Drew.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.082
Jacobs' son?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.087
Jacobs took Drew with him

24:15.187 --> 24:17.790
the night he murdered
Carlos Sanchez.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.292
He told Drew
to stay in the car,

24:20.392 --> 24:21.928
that he'd be right back

24:22.028 --> 24:24.030
and that's when Jacobs
went into the woods.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.331
My God.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.934
Drew had to pee,
he got out of the car.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.069
When he heard
the two men screaming,

24:30.169 --> 24:32.004
he went a little closer

24:32.104 --> 24:33.706
and that's when he saw Jacobs'

24:33.806 --> 24:35.708
hands around Sanchez's neck.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.777
Did Drew actually see

24:37.877 --> 24:39.679
his father choke Sanchez out?

24:39.779 --> 24:41.213
No, he got scared, immediately

24:41.313 --> 24:43.015
turned and ran back to the car.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.585
And what about Jacobs?
Does he know that Drew saw him?

24:45.685 --> 24:46.986
No.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.788
But later that night,
when Drew got home,

24:48.888 --> 24:50.657
he told his mom what he saw.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.291
It was a turning point for Ava.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.326
She realized
she couldn't protect Drew

24:54.426 --> 24:56.462
unless Jacobs went away.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.930
So she let you
talk to him.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.133
Yeah, but only if I promised Ava

25:01.233 --> 25:02.969
that...

25:03.069 --> 25:05.672
Jacobs would never know it
was Drew that gave him up.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.506
And... until today

25:07.607 --> 25:09.475
I planned to take that
to my grave, okay?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.477
You think that this kid,
he remembers any of this?

25:11.578 --> 25:13.713
No, he was five at the time.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.482
But when I talked to him...

25:16.583 --> 25:18.751
it wasn't as a cop.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.588
I asked him
all the right questions.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.956
I got all the information.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.125
And then I put together

25:26.225 --> 25:28.294
the rest
of the investigation myself.

25:28.394 --> 25:29.762
And now Ava might die.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.031
And Jacobs has Drew.
Regina, Regina.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.634
Given everything that Jacobs
has done since he's gotten out--

25:34.734 --> 25:36.636
the EMTs, the Marshals, Ava.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.005
If his intent was to hurt Drew,

25:39.105 --> 25:41.407
he would have done it already.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.513
I really hope
you're right about that.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.616
Yeah?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.951
Inspector?
Oh.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.653
Officer Bentley pulled
this passport photo

25:53.753 --> 25:56.923
out of a dumpster at
Alex Bird's place of business.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.692
The shipping store.
The kid had his eyes closed.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.994
It's probably why
they tossed it.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.264
It's Drew.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.833
Can we make a case to the judge

26:06.933 --> 26:08.635
that Bird's been making
fake passports?

26:08.735 --> 26:10.903
We can try.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.272
Good work, Officer
Sandeford, good work.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.907
You're not the only one
that wants to see

26:15.007 --> 26:16.442
Jacobs back behind bars.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.344
I know some people saw
this cat as some kind of...

26:18.444 --> 26:20.546
folk hero, but I caught
more than one body

26:20.647 --> 26:23.082
that I'm sure was Jacobs'
doing during his reign.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.552
<i>All right, we got
lunch from Goody's in the house!</i>

26:26.653 --> 26:28.520
Ma'am, ma'am,
with all due respect,

26:28.621 --> 26:30.256
I don't care what
your psychic friend told you,

26:30.356 --> 26:32.158
Lamonte Jacobs was not sitting

26:32.258 --> 26:34.526
at the front row of <i>Hamilton</i>
last night, thank you.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.062
Geez.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.697
What's got your panties
all in a bunch?

26:37.797 --> 26:39.498
Very funny. Who told you?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.400
Told me what?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.670
Some kids at Ruskin Gardens
stole my underwear.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.774
So you're going commando?
No.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.576
They hate me.
What did you do?

26:50.677 --> 26:51.978
What makes you think
that I did something?

26:52.078 --> 26:54.080
You are kind of defensive,
for one.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.016
So I may or may not have...

26:57.116 --> 27:00.119
Dude, you stink.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.655
Sandeford had me
dumpster diving.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.624
I'm starving.
I'll change after I eat, okay?

27:06.693 --> 27:09.561
Well, I may or may not

27:09.662 --> 27:11.630
have written a couple of tenants

27:11.731 --> 27:13.499
tickets for having a party
too loud last night.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.968
You're lucky
that's all they did.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.636
Well, I screwed up.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.371
How-how am I supposed to fix it?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.107
Well, for one, tear up
the tickets.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.175
And two, stop
acting like a cop

27:23.275 --> 27:24.643
for two seconds
and be a tenant.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.078
That's not even
gonna scratch the surface.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.213
Think bigger.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.881
Like a grand gesture.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.249
Duck?

27:30.349 --> 27:31.951
Who the hell puts duck
on grilled cheese?

27:32.051 --> 27:33.385
It's an American classic.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.387
They also raised the price
of the sandwich

27:35.487 --> 27:36.956
from $6.95 to $17.95,

27:37.056 --> 27:38.657
so you owe me
another 11 bucks.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.592
For grilled cheese?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.795
Yeah, this has Gruyère cheese
and caramelized onions on it.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.132
Gruyère! Killian... you
got to talk to Corinne.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.467
I've been eating the same
grilled cheese sandwich for

27:48.567 --> 27:50.602
ten years at Goody's. You don't
mess with a man's sandwich.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.471
I hear you, all right,
but I'm trying to be supportive.

27:52.571 --> 27:55.107
Just try it. You might like it. Doubtful.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.475
Well, if you don't want it,
Captain, I'll take it.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.111
Hands off. $17.95.
Killian, Morales?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.748
I need you to put James Moon
in interrogation room one.

28:01.848 --> 28:04.316
And Pastor Rae in room two.
Even though they lawyered up?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.485
You got a problem with that?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.655
All right, let's go.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.860
Well, your lawyer should
be here any second.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.295
I mean, not that he's gonna
be able to do anything more

28:16.395 --> 28:19.565
than maybe plead your sentence
down from ten years to seven.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.569
You know, I understand
why Jacobs'

28:23.669 --> 28:25.805
business associates
are helping him, but...

28:25.905 --> 28:28.574
for the life of me,
I can't figure out why you are.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.810
<i>I asked for my lawyer.</i>

28:30.910 --> 28:32.311
And he's on his way.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.680
I just thought you'd be
more comfortable

28:34.781 --> 28:36.749
waiting for him in here.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.684
With me.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.286
Here, there?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.321
I ain't got nothing to say.

28:46.025 --> 28:50.296
Do you even know how many times
my church has been vandalized?

28:50.396 --> 28:51.630
Robbed?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.465
12 times.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.135
One night I was
walking to my car

28:56.235 --> 28:57.603
and two guys jumped me.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.806
They threw me
in the back of their car.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.607
And at gunpoint,

29:01.707 --> 29:05.377
they forced me to empty out
my entire bank account.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.613
And then they beat
the crap out of me,

29:07.713 --> 29:09.281
threw me out of their car

29:09.381 --> 29:11.017
on the side
of a road.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.020
And I had nightmares
about it for months.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.222
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.591
But then, uh,
Nora Jacobs,

29:19.691 --> 29:21.293
Lamonte's mom,

29:21.393 --> 29:22.995
she brought her son
to church one day.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.764
And he asked me
to describe to him

29:25.865 --> 29:29.535
what those two men looked like.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.938
And within a day,

29:32.038 --> 29:34.406
he found out where they were.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.076
And he restored
law and order

29:37.176 --> 29:40.679
to my church
and everyone else around it.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.483
And I slept better
that night than I had...

29:45.852 --> 29:48.020
...in a very long time.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.059
With the way
this community feels

29:53.159 --> 29:54.360
about Jacobs, I'm starting

29:54.460 --> 29:55.995
to wonder if we're ever
gonna catch him.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.030
Ava's awake.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.232

Hey.

30:09.909 --> 30:10.943
When y'all done
with this little

30:11.043 --> 30:12.011
fishing expedition,

30:12.111 --> 30:13.412
I'm gonna sue your asses.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.680
Yeah?

30:15.848 --> 30:18.317
Well, if I find out
that you knew where that kid was

30:18.417 --> 30:19.685
and you said nothing,

30:19.785 --> 30:21.353
I will make it
my mission

30:21.453 --> 30:24.223
that the D.A.
and the judge on the case

30:24.323 --> 30:25.691
throw the book at you.

30:25.791 --> 30:26.993
You got me?

30:27.093 --> 30:28.494
Yeah, whatever, old man.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.828
Yeah.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.297
Whatever.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.600
Stan.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.068
You're gonna want
to see this.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.541
I hope you look good in orange.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.114
Tell me you found Drew.
Not yet.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.281
But we're working
on it.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.217
Now-- One second.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.120
It's a text from
Captain Yenko.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.290
Is it about Drew?

30:58.390 --> 30:59.758
Did they find them?

31:00.526 --> 31:02.561
These are new passport photos
taken today.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.331
I know it looks bad...

31:05.431 --> 31:06.865
but I can explain.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.367
Seeing as you almost died,

31:08.467 --> 31:09.835
I don't think Lamonte
shooting you was for show.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.204
So why don't you tell us
what the hell is going on.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.842
Lamonte told me about his plans
to break out of prison.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.511
He said he wanted
Drew and I to join him.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.881
I thought
he was talking crazy.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.183
But the more we talked,

31:24.283 --> 31:25.751
the more he convinced me
that James Moon

31:25.851 --> 31:28.554
and Alex Bird
were gonna help us get away.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.258
The plan was to get passports

31:32.358 --> 31:35.327
and then lay low in Cuba
before heading to Morocco.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.728
Where there's no extradition.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.730
After everything
you went through--

31:38.830 --> 31:40.266
<i>we</i> went through--

31:40.366 --> 31:41.733
to put him away!

31:41.833 --> 31:43.302
To protect Drew. Why?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.671
I had issues with my husband.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.340
He smacked me around
a few times.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.641
Jacobs swooped in.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.842
Right?

31:50.943 --> 31:53.112
Made a bunch of promises.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.846
He seemed like a changed man.

31:54.947 --> 31:55.948
Yeah.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.617
But it was more than that.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.420
Drew started asking a lot
of questions about his daddy.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.755
He wanted a
relationship with him,

32:03.855 --> 32:06.825
and Lamonte promised me he
was done being a gangster.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.794
He just wanted
to be a father to Drew.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.362
And you fell for that?

32:10.462 --> 32:14.366
He said Morocco had
the most beautiful beaches.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.901
And he wanted
to take Drew fishing

32:16.002 --> 32:18.604
like he used to
at Greenpoint Landing.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.172
Guess I got...

32:20.272 --> 32:21.974
caught up in
the idea of us

32:22.074 --> 32:23.275
being a family again.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.776
So what changed?

32:24.876 --> 32:26.312
When did it all go wrong?

32:26.412 --> 32:29.048
He promised me he was done
with his dope-dealing days.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.582
But then...

32:30.682 --> 32:32.551
he showed up at the salon.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.753
Started talking about how Canada

32:34.853 --> 32:36.155
was gonna hook him up
with some product

32:36.255 --> 32:37.689
to move.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.725
He said we couldn't leave
until we met up with her.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.127
"Her"?

32:41.227 --> 32:43.129
Canada's a person?
Not the country?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.896
Canada Howard.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.165
James Moon's cousin.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.067
Guess she's
a player now.

32:48.167 --> 32:52.204
I should have known
the second Canada started

32:52.304 --> 32:54.873
passing him notes in prison...

32:54.973 --> 32:57.376
he had no intention
of leaving the game.

32:57.476 --> 33:01.913
Ava, what time is Lamonte
meeting up with Canada?

33:02.881 --> 33:05.851
Jacobs didn't get into specifics
about where the meet

33:05.951 --> 33:08.554
with Canada was going
to take place-- just that

33:08.654 --> 33:10.189
it was supposed to happen
at around 4:00.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.358
That doesn't give us
much time.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.792
We searched
James Moon's apartment,

33:13.892 --> 33:15.927
Canada Howard's house.
Their cars are accounted for.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.063
We got nothing.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.930
Yeah, James Moon's lawyer
is here,

33:19.031 --> 33:20.932
so he ain't saying anything.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.334
Nothing.
No.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.470
Checked Canada's phone logs, emails,

33:24.570 --> 33:26.538
social media sites--
all dead ends.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.440
So we don't know exactly
where they're meeting

33:28.540 --> 33:30.142
to do this
exchange, but,

33:30.242 --> 33:32.611
come on, there's-there's only
so many ways out of the city.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.413
And didn't Ava say something
about Jacobs having

33:34.513 --> 33:36.115
a-a connect in Florida,

33:36.215 --> 33:37.449
supposed to help
'em get to Cuba?

33:37.549 --> 33:38.884
With the amount of heat
he has on him,

33:38.984 --> 33:40.919
there's no way
he would charter a private jet

33:41.019 --> 33:43.122
and risk getting pinched.
It's just...
Yeah. With the Amber Alert

33:43.222 --> 33:44.723
that they put out
on Drew,

33:44.823 --> 33:46.492
doesn't make much sense
taking a bus or a car either.

33:46.592 --> 33:47.926
And once he meets
up with Canada,

33:48.026 --> 33:49.995
he's gonna be carrying
weight, so it's just...

33:50.096 --> 33:51.063
What's left?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.864
A boat?

33:53.932 --> 33:58.404
Ava mentioned that Jacobs
wanted to take Drew fishing,

33:58.504 --> 34:00.639
just like he did
at Greenpoint Landing.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.708
Less traffic there
than at Silver Creek Landing.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.611
I mean, you know, you just push
off and no one would notice.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.080
Come on.
Let's go.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.383
Hey, this is Suarez for Harbor.

34:18.524 --> 34:19.758
You're here.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.128
You got the package?
Yeah.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.795
Hey!

34:24.696 --> 34:25.631
She was here
when I got here.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.898
She took my phone.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.934
Don't worry about it.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.172
Inspector Haywood. Lamonte.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.606
You weren't really going
to leave

34:34.706 --> 34:36.308
without saying goodbye,
were you?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.410
You're
a fascinating woman.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.285
Where the rest
of them at?

34:46.385 --> 34:47.619
Lamonte, come on.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.121
'Cause I know
you're not alone.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.856
Where the rest of them at?
Dad,

34:50.956 --> 34:52.824
this is the woman
from Mom's salon. Yeah.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.260
I know, son.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.994
Hey.
I know.

34:56.795 --> 34:57.996
This nice woman

34:58.096 --> 34:59.198
just came

34:59.298 --> 35:01.233
to wish us well on our trip, right?

35:02.067 --> 35:03.269
Right? 'Cause you
know damn well

35:03.369 --> 35:04.636
I ain't going back.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.538
And you know there's no way
I'm letting you get away

35:06.638 --> 35:07.606
with your son.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.375
The only way I'm leaving here

35:09.475 --> 35:11.076
with you is in a body bag.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.544
And I know

35:12.644 --> 35:13.979
you're not gonna shoot at me,

35:14.079 --> 35:16.047
'cause you ain't gonna risk
hurting my son.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.383
Right?

35:17.483 --> 35:18.984
So why don't you just go
on your merry little way?

35:19.084 --> 35:20.919
Is this really what restitution
looks like to you?

35:21.019 --> 35:22.754
I got my son, all right?

35:22.854 --> 35:25.224
All these years,
him being raised

35:25.324 --> 35:26.725
by somebody else.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.560
Teaching him how to ride a bike
and-and throw a ball

35:28.660 --> 35:29.961
'cause you locked me up!

35:30.762 --> 35:31.930
So, yes,

35:32.030 --> 35:33.432
this is what restitution
looks like.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.767
So what now? Drew spends
the rest of his life on the run,

35:35.867 --> 35:37.336
away from the only person
who's known him

35:37.436 --> 35:39.471
every single day
of his life, his mother?

35:39.571 --> 35:41.973
Is this the kind of life
that you want for Drew?

35:42.073 --> 35:43.675
He's with his father!

35:43.775 --> 35:46.478
I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life locked up in a cage!

35:47.879 --> 35:48.780
Not being able

35:48.880 --> 35:49.915
to hug my son.

35:50.015 --> 35:50.816
Get on
the boat.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.050
Get on the boat!

35:55.854 --> 35:57.589
Don't even
think about it!

35:57.689 --> 35:58.790
Dad, what's going on?

35:58.890 --> 35:59.991
Please don't
shoot us.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.127
Please, don't shoot us.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.762
Don't worry
about it, son.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.130
Nobody's gonna shoot you. Dad.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.265
Please.
Nobody's gonna shoot you, okay?

36:06.365 --> 36:08.367
Drew, why don't
you come with us.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.368
Let the boy go.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.637
Dad.
Listen to me, son.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.440
Dad, please.
Now, listen to me.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.841
I love you, Dad.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.543
Just let go.

36:19.611 --> 36:20.779
Please, Dad.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.114
Please.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.819
Son, I love you. Okay?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.855
I love you.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.934
Sorry, cuz.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.337
Take him away.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.763
That's twice now that you,
uh, collared this guy.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.231
Yeah.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.866
They might be putting
you up for a medal. Somehow,

37:14.966 --> 37:17.669
it doesn't feel like much
of a victory to me this time.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.070
You worried about them?

37:19.170 --> 37:20.706
That make me a bad cop? I...

37:20.806 --> 37:22.774
got too close
on this one.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.576
Makes you human.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.613
I guess I can live with that.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.715
You did everything
you could on this one, Regina.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.116
And she's free
to go.

37:31.216 --> 37:32.884
Now it's gonna be up
to Ava to...

37:32.984 --> 37:35.421
do right by that young man.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.256
Can you give me a ride
back to the precinct?

37:38.357 --> 37:41.660
Uh, I think you can walk
and clear your head.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.228
Mm, yeah, I mean...

37:43.329 --> 37:46.097
it's a long walk.
Come on.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.335
Yo.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.470
No, please,
do not put me on hold.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.972
My <i>God.</i>

37:55.040 --> 37:56.975
Yo.
They put me on hold.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.144
You want to go grab a drink?

37:59.244 --> 38:00.579
You know, you'd think
a cop calling the city

38:00.679 --> 38:02.280
about a busted elevator
in the projects would,

38:02.381 --> 38:03.882
you know, help move the needle
just a little bit.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.917
You know how many elevators
are broken down

38:06.017 --> 38:07.386
all around this city?
Yeah.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.220
It would take--
it would take...

38:09.321 --> 38:10.856
the president of the United
States being stuck inside

38:10.956 --> 38:12.257
to get them to fix it.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.293
You're a genius.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.962
That's genius.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.698
Not sure what I said,
but okay.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.999
<i>Calling 311</i>

38:21.099 --> 38:22.701
and telling 'em
that Deputy Mayor Sharpe

38:22.801 --> 38:24.035
was stuck inside this elevator?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.637
I should phone your superior.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.006
Well, according to
Penal Code 1968, Ted,

38:28.106 --> 38:30.642
this broken elevator is
a life and safety violation.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.810
Don't penal code me.

38:31.910 --> 38:32.844
Fine.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.212
Mrs. Ferguson.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.514
Who?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.248
She's 68 years old
and lives on the sixth floor.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.884
She has a wheelchair and
hasn't been able to go outside

38:38.984 --> 38:40.486
for the past three months
because you never came around

38:40.586 --> 38:41.953
to fixing this elevator.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.990
And then there's Mr. Williams.
He's 82, on the fifth floor.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.925
He's diabetic
and walks with a cane.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.427
And he's been missing
his past three months

38:48.527 --> 38:51.897
of doctors' appointments
because of this broken elevator.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.499
Okay, Susan B. Anthony.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.766
You made your point.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.502
No, I don't think I did, Ted.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.304
The only reason you came here
tonight to fix this elevator

38:59.405 --> 39:01.507
is 'cause you thought someone
important was stuck inside.

39:01.607 --> 39:04.242
But I want you to know
that every single person

39:04.342 --> 39:07.145
in this building
is important.

39:10.115 --> 39:13.184
You might want to save some
for your Emmy speech.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.086
I'm just glad
we're finally having that beer.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.823
The foyer isn't exactly what
I had in mind, but yeah.

39:17.923 --> 39:18.990
What are you talking about?

39:19.090 --> 39:20.091
This is our den.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.192
And out there,

39:21.292 --> 39:23.395
that's our living room.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.563
I've learned.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.066
Okay.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.435
That should do it.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.970
Let's take her
for a spin.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.045
What the hell was that?

39:56.828 --> 39:58.730
Oh, my goodness.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.103
Have the desk sergeant enter
the paperwork on my desk

40:05.203 --> 40:06.572
before going home. Okay.

40:06.672 --> 40:10.008
Hey. You ever have a grilled
cheese sandwich with duck?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.543
No. It sounds disgusting.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.344
That's what I thought.
And then I tried it,

40:13.445 --> 40:15.581
and the meat was so tender.
So I look it up,

40:15.681 --> 40:19.284
and I find out it's cooked
in its own fat for hours.

40:19.384 --> 40:22.020
Ooh. Oh, that reminds me--
my birthday cake.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.021
I almost forgot.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.656
Oh, ab-about that.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.059
With all the cops and the
detectives and the marshals--

40:28.159 --> 40:30.095
d-don't forget
the marshals...

40:30.896 --> 40:32.197
...they ate your cake.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.168
It wasn't much of
a birthday anyway.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.038
I'm sorry. Yeah.

40:43.909 --> 40:44.810
Come on.
All right.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.377
Let's go. Okay.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.446
