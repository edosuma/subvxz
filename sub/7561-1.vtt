01:42.680 --> 01:44.959
Hi. You were going to come at 3pm.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.559
Get down.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.399
Where is the manager?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.519
Where is the manager?

02:31.280 --> 02:33.399
Have mercy.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.159
Police. Stop.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.559
Watch out.
They're blocking the back too.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.999
Freeze.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.719
Police. Freeze.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.639
Police.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.199
Freeze.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.799
Where are you? Call me.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.119
Who are you?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.479
Milan.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.679
Give me your gun.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.279
- I threw it away.
- You threw it away?

10:39.560 --> 10:41.439
I think I've killed someone.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.359
I didn't want to.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.079
Where's Rajko? I've heard shots.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.119
I know. That was to say hello
to the Arab.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.199
We need to go there.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.119
How are you, Khalil?

11:14.240 --> 11:17.639
- Anything from the fingerprints?
- Nothing.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.839
Were we able to follow
the blood trace?

11:19.960 --> 11:24.039
No. Found yourself a flat yet?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.799
Not yet. Sir, with your permission,

11:26.920 --> 11:32.319
I feel like I'm ready
to take the lead on this one.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.399
You've got an instinct
where they're from?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.639
I'll see what I can do.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.599
This is Kirsty Wilkinson from Interpol.
They'll work with us.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.159
Hello? Where are you?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.919
Have you seen the news?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.199
You screwed up,
that makes it impossible.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.679
Hang on, so...

12:57.800 --> 13:00.199
It will be impossible
to get rid of the diamonds.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.439
- We did what we were told.
- You've killed a little girl.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.319
You promised. Hello? Hello?

14:23.880 --> 14:27.279
Afterwards the three robbers
split in different directions.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.599
We lost them all.
But diamonds are a different matter.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.359
I mean...

14:35.240 --> 14:37.439
Fucking insurance.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.959
The man who shot the kid entered
this street with the diamonds.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.799
We see on the CCTV he has the diamonds.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.279
On the next CCTV
he doesn't have the diamonds anymore.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.639
At first I was stumped,
until we noticed this woman.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.239
And this woman comes from here.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.599
But by the time we go
into this street, she's gone.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.319
What do you mean gone?
What did this camera show?

15:02.440 --> 15:03.799
Nothing.

15:03.920 --> 15:08.399
It took them twenty-four hours
to realise the tape, this tape,

15:08.520 --> 15:12.799
had been accidentally wiped.
Our sole solid lead.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.919
- Someone's fucking with us.
- Insurance.

17:45.480 --> 17:49.039
- Why didn't you open the door?
- You're early.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.759
- Are the others here?
- Where's Rajko?

17:54.480 --> 17:55.919
I haven't heard them.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.999
In Marseille. He was shot.
We believe he is still alive.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.039
- Do you have the money?
- No.

18:03.880 --> 18:08.239
The deal is off.
My buyer changed his mind.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.679
The dead girl
has made things complicated.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.479
We did what they asked us.
Where is the fucking money, prick?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.479
Leave him alone, Borisav.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.799
Leave him alone.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.559
Tell me she's not dead.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.199
Leave him alone. We need him.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.959
In the past we would have killed him
for what he just did.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.759
What's wrong?

19:00.080 --> 19:03.999
I'll find the money. Give me some time.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.679
A 300000 Euro reward

20:36.760 --> 20:38.959
She was only six years old.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.599
Yes, I've heard.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.079
Did you ever kill someone?

20:51.480 --> 20:54.479
I didn't want to shoot her.
I was aiming at the cops.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.279
That was a great idea, killing a cop.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.919
Will I get my money?

21:09.240 --> 21:12.799
'In the past...'
What does he know about the past?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.119
Follow me to my car.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.959
I have a buyer,
but it's quite a way.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.319
Let's go.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.519
You talked in your sleep all night.

21:35.840 --> 21:40.279
- Did I say anything funny?
- You never say anything funny.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.159
You were cooking
a frigging good breakfast

21:44.280 --> 21:47.079
and calling me your royal highness.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.359
Take my bed.
It's not good for your back.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.279
And it would be good for yours?

21:51.400 --> 21:54.199
I can sleep anywhere.
Khalil has important work to do.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.559
Khalil is fine.
We're keeping the young officer ground.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.439
- I'm fine, mum.
- Do you want coffee?

22:00.560 --> 22:01.879
Thanks.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.359
- None for me?
- Give me a break.

22:05.480 --> 22:06.799
Here.

22:07.480 --> 22:10.159
You sounded scared. In your dreams.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.199
Scared of you?

22:16.080 --> 22:21.319
You never were good with the truth.
A strange skill for a policeman.

22:52.960 --> 22:57.919
Are we going to sell the diamonds here?
They have nothing to offer.

23:21.080 --> 23:26.239
You're ugly. I fuck your mother.
I fuck you too. My dick in your ass.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.879
He likes your hair.

23:47.320 --> 23:52.479
We have a meeting with the judge.
Let me do the talking, OK?

23:53.480 --> 23:56.119
So we've got nothing?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.439
I wouldn't say nothing.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.399
Interpol were pleased
to have the killer's weapon.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.159
With untraceable prints on?
Doesn't seem much use to me.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.559
- We have faces of all the attackers.
- So does the world.

24:11.880 --> 24:15.039
The belief is they are in Serbia now,
yes?

24:15.200 --> 24:19.639
Yes, which is why,
working with Interpol...

24:19.760 --> 24:24.159
- Will Interpol catch them in Serbia?
- They will try.

24:24.360 --> 24:29.679
And fail. Crossboard agreements
aren't worth shit. Particularly there.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.279
Khalil...

24:31.400 --> 24:34.519
They're gone. You're right, we're
not going to catch them like that.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.159
We have to change our strategy.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.079
- To what?
- The weapons.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.599
If we can find who supplied the arms,
then we have a chance.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.119
Maybe we should talk about
this between us before...

24:47.240 --> 24:51.519
If we get the supplier,
we have a lead to follow.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.759
26 gun deaths only in the last year.
Come on.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.599
We need to be strict.

25:02.720 --> 25:08.679
Judge, as much as I admire
my colleague's cowboy style,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.199
I want results too.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.119
With some time...

25:14.120 --> 25:21.839
It's not up to me to do your job,
but doesn't a dual strategy make sense?

25:21.960 --> 25:25.039
You pursue the Interpol route, Roman,

25:25.160 --> 25:30.039
and have your cowboy here
pursue his guns. Could that work?

25:30.880 --> 25:32.039
Yes.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.559
- No problem.
- Do it like that.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.479
Guys, we're done.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.439
I have other plans.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.679
You have nothing. I'm in charge now.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.359
The diamonds are safe.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.839
OK, cos we're driving to Belgrade.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.279
It's good to be home.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.799
I'll get a buyer for us.
Until then you go into hiding.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.839
- Slaughtered lamb, he's coming home!
- How are you, Jani?

32:36.960 --> 32:39.479
- How are you?
- You've grown big.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.999
- You haven't changed.
- Take me to him.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.039
Come on, Jani. I've changed
your diapers when you were little.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.079
Look who's back.

32:57.720 --> 33:02.519
I sell diamonds for a good price.
I need to talk to Zlatko.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.199
What? Do you think
we don't read the papers?

33:07.520 --> 33:10.719
You have bad diamonds you sell
for a low price.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.239
The animal is in trouble
and needs help.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.159
It's been a long time
since someone called me that.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.359
Yes, I'm in trouble.

33:31.280 --> 33:36.679
I'm very sorry, my friend,
but the shop is closed.

33:36.800 --> 33:41.479
Fuck off with your diamonds.
We are serious people.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.319
Go away.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.959
Get him, that piece of shit.

35:20.840 --> 35:26.159
Grab him. Don't move.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.039
Don't move.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.319
He has balls.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.519
Are you crazy?
Don't you know who I am?

35:57.640 --> 35:59.879
You're an animal.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.679
You're good.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.399
It's Milan.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.319
You said
you wouldn't call this number.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.079
We have a big problem.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.999
Well, tell me.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.679
I'm listening.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.799
Why are we here, Khalil?

37:03.120 --> 37:07.399
We don't do this, remember?
You were pretty fucking clear.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.799
- You're fine?
- Yes.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.919
It's strange to be back in Marseille.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.359
This place has changed a lot.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.559
Lots of things changed here.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.159
No kidding.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.799
Did you heard about
the six-year-old girl getting shot?

37:36.920 --> 37:39.799
- What?
- During the diamond raid.

37:42.120 --> 37:47.759
I know they were Serbs.
And I know someone gave them the guns.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.919
You're here for that?

37:53.720 --> 37:55.359
Unbelievable.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.759
You must be desperate
if you're coming to me.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.679
- That's just...
- Fuck you.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.079
Fuck you.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.799
Mokhtar, you know people.
You hear things.

38:16.560 --> 38:21.039
I know nothing. Did you really
expect me to tell you anything?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.839
Take it easy.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.959
How is it to be back home?

38:39.040 --> 38:42.759
- You're watching the house?
- I'm worried for mum.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.639
Don't. I'm there now.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.919
You haven't changed.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.759
- Nina.
- Hi.

39:44.600 --> 39:48.719
If someone comes, don't open the door.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.959
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.039
What's with your head?
You cut yourself shaving?

40:00.760 --> 40:04.039
- I fell whilst I was jogging.
- Idiot.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.959
Hello, Animal.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.919
Hi, Zlatko.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.839
I've tried to tell you, Milan.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.359
- Is that idiot still alive?
- Yes, he's still alive.

40:22.680 --> 40:28.239
Of all the guys I thought you would be
the last to go to the boss.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.359
Damn, Zlatko.
These are hard times.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.439
I want to show you
something that'll interest you.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.799
Is she a cop?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.839
No, they search in groups.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.839
We've been following her.
She's only been installing cameras.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.119
A lonely wolf.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.999
Rather unpleasant.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.519
She's looking for the diamonds.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.239
We aren't sure about the rest.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.919
They left you alone.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.199
I thought that was what you wanted.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.719
I needed money.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.999
For Adnan. He needs heart surgery.

41:32.840 --> 41:36.119
Tell me, who was it?
The Tin Man or the Cowardly Lion?

41:37.680 --> 41:41.959
I need a lot of money.
My brother needs an operation.

41:43.080 --> 41:48.519
You could have asked for a job instead
of stealing diamonds with idiots.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.719
- If you had been smarter...
- Can you help me?

41:57.480 --> 41:59.839
He says that I don't have a choice.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.279
- I only wanted...
- What you wanted, is not important.

42:07.920 --> 42:11.199
The boss has made a list
of things we need to fix.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.759
I have a list too.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.599
You're going to help us.

42:21.640 --> 42:26.519
If those diamonds are interesting
for me, she's on top of that list.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.239
We've had an offer.

42:47.360 --> 42:51.519
- Two hundred thousand.
- That's what Tzigane offered us.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.279
That one hundred thousand less than
what the insurance would have given us.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.519
- We accept the deal.
- Why?

42:57.640 --> 43:00.999
They are real buyers.
I know they will pay.

43:55.280 --> 43:57.959
We know where the guns are.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.479
It's a good source. One of my best.

44:01.640 --> 44:05.039
- Where are they?
- They are where they've always been.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.639
In the city, in Les Agnettes.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.719
Go. I'm with you.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.839
- Let's kill her and go.
- Wait.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.799
Wait.

45:46.680 --> 45:50.599
- We'd better throw her in the river.
- We don't have time.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.039
Come on.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.239
What's wrong? Kill her.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.159
I'll do it.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.919
Please...

47:09.200 --> 47:11.599
It's you.

47:42.920 --> 47:43.919
Hello?

47:44.040 --> 47:47.319
We got the warrant.
We hit Les Agnettes tomorrow at 6 am.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.759
- Is she dead?
- Listen to me.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.079
- It was a big mess.
- What do you mean?

48:03.200 --> 48:06.919
Borisav killed Jani. He came at me,
so I killed Borisav.

48:09.720 --> 48:13.959
- Why did he kill Jani?
- He wanted the diamonds and the money.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.719
And then he took the risk
of attacking you?

48:16.840 --> 48:19.399
He never knew who I really was.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.839
And the woman,
did she have the money on her?

48:26.960 --> 48:30.359
Fuck the money,
do you have the diamonds?

48:35.760 --> 48:37.399
And this is a bonus.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.559
You see that I don't hide anything.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.719
Come.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.479
Zlatko wants to talk to you.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.559
Welcome home, Milan.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.119
Go. You need to talk.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.999
