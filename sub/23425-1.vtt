01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.906
But it's time sensitive,
so we should get going.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:06.908
OK, I'll just go change.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.077
No need.
You won't be wearing that outfit for long.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:10.577
Presumptuous.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.331
- And dead wrong.
- Not like that.

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:14.791
It's just,

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:17.752
the best date ever requires...

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.297
a little wardrobe change.

[hip hop music playing]

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.271
Well played, Harris.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.064
Very original.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.148
[Kevin] Yeah.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:04.924
So...

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:08.636
What are your Theta girls gonna say
now that you're out of the nerd closet?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.599
This is not an image I plan on projecting
to my Thetas.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:16.561
You know, it's like there's this
awesome chick inside you, right?

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:18.271
But then on the surface,

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:21.483
it's like work, success, motivation...

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.650
You wouldn't understand.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:24.444
- You have white parents.
- What is that...

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:28.406
Bougie black parents are tough. Perfect
black girls did not read comic books.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.950
I had to steal them from my guy friends.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.536
I don't know.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.376
It's like I got so good at doing exactly
what I was supposed to do that...

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.130
it didn't really leave time
to find a passion.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.007
You could always be a zombie slayer.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.551
Relax.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.136
You'll figure it out.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.306
It's that simple, huh?

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:55.350
It can be.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.817
So, why are you single?

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.152
Uh...

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:11.616
Every girl I tried to date
was crazy, flaky,

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.743
and in the last case,

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:15.036

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:20.958
So...

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.127
Actually,

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.670
I have a confession to make.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.422
I am...

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:27.548

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.801
I'm dependable

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.674
You shook our house.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:12.844
We lost a row of
totally irreplaceable shot glasses.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.222
Hello? I was talking to you!

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.348
I think you're ready.

[Jamilah] Hey.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.245
What's up, ladies?

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.958
Well, this is one lame surprise party.

Soror Yvonne.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:52.008
I am not calling you "Soror Yvonne."

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.053
Did you violate the sanctity
of our sisterhood?

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.808
Have you betrayed all of your black,
Greek brothers and sisters?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.063
Those are very abstract questions.

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.606
Oh, so you think this is funny?

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.024
Well, let me remind you.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:13.446
Our organizations were founded
to create community where there was none,

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.366
built upon sisterhood,

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.743
in a world that did not welcome us.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:21.037
And over a hundred years,

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.623
we have stood the test of time.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:24.832
This is your fault!

- My...
- Yes! You and Dad screwed me with Harvard.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.295
This has nothing to do with family.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.339
Well, I didn't start this conversation,

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.466
and I damn sure didn't send for you.

Sorry it's not going the way you planned,
Soror Yvonne.

Why don't you just run to the SBBs?

They're not your sorors.
They're not your friends.

You're the help.

- I know this looks really bad...
- I'm sorry. I have to fire you.

to Harvard.

- I don't know. Give me 40 seconds.

I only have one class left,
and I can finish it online.

So I'm gonna go back to Philly
and figure out my next move.

- Steptacular is ten days away.

without our captain?

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:45.992
Danielle is your captain.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.077
It will be fine. You guys know this stuff.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.747
You don't have a job.
Just stay with us until Steptacular.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:52.415
- I really can't.
- This is bullshit.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.542
I don't have time for this, you guys!

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:56.753
I have spent every minute on SBB.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:59.797
- Now, I have no job, my sorors hate me...
- And that's our fault?

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.799
My life was perfect before coaching SBB.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.843
This is obviously
the worst mistake I've made.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.178
Wow.

You spout out this sisterhood shit,
and then you bail when we need you?

What was in it for you?

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:13.060
So you and the Thetas could just laugh
at a bunch of dumb white girls?

- Hello! We're not all white girls.
- To get closer to my brother?

And Dean Berman is an alum.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.374
And so, what?

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:39.754
You worked out a deal that
if you tame some crazy white girls,

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:41.964

I went to a Theta informational meeting.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.964
My mother and my grandmother,
they're both Thetas.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:27.218
But you guys rejected me
because I was too whitewashed.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.683
I didn't realize.

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:34.851
It's fine.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.062
I dodged a bullet.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.356
SBB is not perfect.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.151
But at least we judge on actions
and not stereotypes.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.364
We're better off without you...

Only problem is just that

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:11.762

OK.
You messed with the wrong bitch today!

What the hell is wrong with you?

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:58.851
I thought you were a crazy person.
Obviously, I was right.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.519
I sent the pictures to Dean Berman.

[Taser crackling]

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:07.485
I thought you'd get into a little trouble
and we could bail on Steptacular,

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.153
and I could get SBB back in order.

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.488
I was trying to protect Kevin!

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.616
I do not believe this shit!
After everything I did for you?

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.743
In all fairness, you did it for yourself.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:18.579
Actually, it was me. It was me!
It was all me!

SBB needs you.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:39.767
You may not actually be an SBB,
but you're still one of our sisters.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.602
I was your coach!

Not your sister.
It doesn't work like that.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.444
I thought Steptacular was a bad idea
from the beginning. I admit it.

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:52.697
But the girls really want to do it...

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.280
together.

with the real second-place team,

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:58.730
Sigma Beta Beta,

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.982
the real second-place step team.

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:02.817
[audience cheering]

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:06.821
[Aisha] OK. Alright. OK.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:30.178
[Jamilah's dad] Under the tutelage
of trailblazing senior, Jamilah Bishop,

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.263
SBB has made history

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:36.392
and managed to keep
a community institution's doors open.

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:37.935
[Jamilah's dad chuckles]

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:40.897
- That's my baby girl.
- I know.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.981
[car door closing]

01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:50.656
Hi, guys.

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.497
I can be strong-willed,

01:37:58.081 --> 01:37:59.373
forceful,

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:00.541
intransigent.

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:04.796
All qualities that make me
one of the best judges in Pennsylvania.

01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:11.469
But they can also make me
a difficult mother.

01:38:12.261 --> 01:38:15.098
And I've learned,
with the help of my therapist...

01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:18.017
that I am jealous

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:21.896
that you are a freer spirit than I.

01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:27.276
And I am working on
accepting you unconditionally

01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:30.446
because that is the way I love you.

01:38:32.031 --> 01:38:33.741
If you do it one more time, Negro...

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:35.827
I know how to be civil,

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.997
unlike a certain physically fit
White House princess.

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.708
You are literally
the only person in the world

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:44.794
that does not love Michelle Obama.

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.130
But most importantly,

01:38:47.213 --> 01:38:49.799
we're endorsing you to Harvard, baby girl.

01:38:58.558 --> 01:39:00.101
I'm not going to Harvard.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:03.062
[dance music playing]

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:11.279
[Dean Berman] What's next for you?

01:39:11.904 --> 01:39:12.822
Get my drink on,

01:39:12.905 --> 01:39:14.866
grab a couple guys,
try out my new vibrator.

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:15.992
[Dean Berman hoots]

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:18.369
Boundaries! Hello!

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:21.164
Seriously, don't dodge the question.
What's next?

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:24.500
You know, I've never said this...

01:39:25.918 --> 01:39:26.918
I don't know.

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:28.588
I don't know.

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.380
Feels good.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.342
Luckily, I can work at 40th Street
until I figure it out.

01:39:33.426 --> 01:39:35.219
You're a real rock star over there.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:39.015
I've got to run. Nick just got back
from The Pleasure Chest.

01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:45.605
[laughter]

01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:51.611
I heard you got shit canned.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:53.529
[Jamilah laughs without humor]

01:39:53.613 --> 01:39:55.072
And I let you get away.

01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:57.115
Hmm...

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:58.367
[both laugh without humor]

01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:02.079
Look, I know some people speechify
about inclusion and equality and...

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:03.247
[Jamilah] Uh-huh.

01:40:04.207 --> 01:40:06.876
I do. Fine. I do. But...

01:40:07.293 --> 01:40:10.504
I mean, you really
walked the walk with SBB,

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:12.340
and I'm proud of you.

01:40:13.883 --> 01:40:14.967
Look, I...

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:17.511
I should have never
taken you for granted, Jamilah.

01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:19.472
Dane, we're cool.

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:21.724
You're still my nigga.

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:26.187
That's...

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:27.270
That's...

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.942
That's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

Oh, I'm sorry.

OK. Hello?

Before you two get to second base,

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.675
