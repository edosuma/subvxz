The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

12:07.228 --> 12:10.815
It's like the words
"algebra," "alchemy," "alcohol."

12:10.898 --> 12:12.483
It derives from
an Arabic noun

12:12.566 --> 12:14.485
combined with the
Arabic article "al" before it.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.489
The origin of our
Italian <i>albicocca</i>

12:18.572 --> 12:20.199
is <i>al-barquq.</i>

It's amazing that
today in Israel and many Arab countries,

12:23.244 --> 12:26.664

by a totally different name, <i>Mismish.</i>

12:34.547 --> 12:36.149
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

12:36.173 --> 12:38.426
do find their origins
in Greek words.

12:38.509 --> 12:39.611
However, in the case
of "apricot,"

12:39.635 --> 12:41.720
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.264
How so?

12:43.597 --> 12:46.308
Well, here, the Greek
actually takes over from the Latin.

12:46.392 --> 12:49.353
Latin word being,
<i>praecoquum</i> or <i>precoquere.</i>

12:49.437 --> 12:51.248
So it's, "Precook" or,
"Pre-ripen,"as you know.

12:51.272 --> 12:52.481
To be precocious or premature.

12:53.691 --> 12:54.942
And the Byzantines,
to go on,

12:55.025 --> 12:57.862

became <i>berikokki,</i>
