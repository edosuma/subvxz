00:01.198 --> 00:02.767
<i>Previously </i> The Lying Game

00:02.768 --> 00:04.528
So, Emma, how
was Phoenix?

00:04.586 --> 00:05.587
I gotta know.

00:05.622 --> 00:06.756
Oh, what about
your birth mom?

00:06.790 --> 00:09.459
I really just told you
everything, didn't I?

00:09.494 --> 00:10.828
These people are lying to you.

00:10.862 --> 00:11.897
They lied to Sutton.

00:11.931 --> 00:13.565
They're lying
to each other.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.769
I thought you said you and
Justin were waiting.

00:15.803 --> 00:17.505
Then I guess we kind of stopped.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.507
I'm sorry.
I should've known better.

00:19.542 --> 00:21.811
I know how lies can tear
a family apart.

00:21.845 --> 00:26.816
As a lawyer, how can you tell
if someone is hiding something?

00:26.850 --> 00:29.819
That's an excellent
question, Sutton.

00:29.853 --> 00:31.787
<i>You're getting soft, man.</i>

00:31.821 --> 00:33.923
You go in there, right now,
and break up with her.

00:33.957 --> 00:36.193
- I just have to leave.
- Did you really think

00:36.194 --> 00:38.010
you were pulling
this off, Sutton?

00:38.082 --> 00:40.083
You've gotta let me get back
together with Char.

00:40.117 --> 00:43.052
What if I decided to reinstate
those possession charges?

00:43.086 --> 00:45.153
I'm starting to regret
sending this letter.

00:45.188 --> 00:46.254
<i>It could really get her</i>
<i>in trouble.</i>

00:46.289 --> 00:48.056
Then maybe you should
go back there

00:48.091 --> 00:49.057
and make things right.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.192
Maybe.

00:50.226 --> 00:51.995
<i>How could I think</i>

00:52.030 --> 00:53.264
that everything
would work out here?

00:53.298 --> 00:56.034
Ethan, I have to leave Phoenix
as soon as possible.

00:56.068 --> 01:00.073
Wherever you go, Emma,
I'm coming with you.

01:16.095 --> 01:17.295
Excuse me, sir.

01:17.329 --> 01:19.264
How much longer
till Phoenix?

01:19.298 --> 01:22.001
Won't be too much longer,
if you get back in your seat.

01:37.186 --> 01:40.122
Wake up, sleepyhead.

01:40.156 --> 01:43.158
Happy birthday, honey.

01:43.193 --> 01:44.994
Per tradition,
breakfast in bed.

01:45.028 --> 01:47.029
Waffles, butter, syrup.

01:47.064 --> 01:49.331
I know you hate it, but there's
no escaping.

01:49.366 --> 01:52.134
This is great.
I don't even know what to say.

01:52.168 --> 01:54.870
You can start with
your birthday wish.

01:54.904 --> 01:56.938
But if I say it out loud,
it won't come true.

01:56.972 --> 01:58.173
Duh!

01:58.207 --> 02:00.108
That's why we always do
the bogus wish.

02:00.142 --> 02:02.076
Like last year,
what I wished for--

02:02.111 --> 02:03.945
anybody remember?
Anybody?

02:03.979 --> 02:06.214
That you never
get a boyfriend.

02:06.248 --> 02:07.949
That's right.

02:07.983 --> 02:08.949
And now I have one.

02:08.985 --> 02:10.217
Okay.

02:15.159 --> 02:18.261
I wish I could run away
and never come back.

02:18.295 --> 02:21.365
Okay...

02:21.399 --> 02:23.033
Excellent.
Excellent.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.301
Let's leave the birthday
girl to herself.

02:24.335 --> 02:27.004
We've got lots to do
before the party.

02:27.038 --> 02:29.039
Oh! This is a
pre-birthday gift.

02:29.073 --> 02:33.277
Sneaky suspicion
you are going to love it.

02:33.311 --> 02:34.978
Guys, wait...

02:39.183 --> 02:40.350
This was really great.

02:40.385 --> 02:42.986
Thank you.

02:43.020 --> 02:45.322
Hey, just the
beginning.

02:57.369 --> 02:58.903
Hi.

03:01.908 --> 03:04.076
Hi.

03:04.111 --> 03:05.244
Happy birthday.

03:10.017 --> 03:11.318
That means everything.

03:14.022 --> 03:17.992
Okay, we both know how
Sutton could be back here

03:18.026 --> 03:21.229
any second now.

03:21.264 --> 03:22.998
I'm pretty much
ready to go.

03:23.032 --> 03:24.333
Are you?

03:26.403 --> 03:28.204
I can't.

03:28.238 --> 03:31.374
I thought I could, but I love
these people, Ethan.

03:34.078 --> 03:36.279
I'm going to tell them
the truth.

So I thought about it all night,

and then again this morning and,

04:02.124 --> 04:07.161
however they react-- whether
it's anger or disappointment,

04:07.195 --> 04:10.364
whatever,
it... it's my only hope

04:10.398 --> 04:11.932
of having a future here.

04:14.102 --> 04:18.172
I'm going to tell them
the truth about who I am.

04:22.310 --> 04:26.047
What?

04:26.081 --> 04:28.950
I'm proud of you.

04:54.274 --> 04:55.308
Derek?

04:55.342 --> 04:58.077
What are you doing here?

04:58.112 --> 05:00.380
I'm here to win you back.

05:02.015 --> 05:03.115
It's not that easy.

05:03.150 --> 05:04.983
You hurt me.

05:05.018 --> 05:07.019
You kind of broke my heart.

05:07.053 --> 05:10.221
I screwed up,
I admit that.

05:10.256 --> 05:11.957
I was scared.

05:11.991 --> 05:14.092
Scared. Of who?

05:14.126 --> 05:17.195
Me, or... maybe Alec?

05:17.229 --> 05:20.931
Sutton came to me with more
crazy accusations.

05:20.965 --> 05:22.933
She said she saw you and Alec
together at the club,

05:22.967 --> 05:24.968
and then, out of the blue,
you break up with me.

05:25.003 --> 05:28.037
Char, these gentlemen just
showed up at the front door.

05:28.072 --> 05:29.405
They said they have some
questions for Derek.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.174
Yeah, son.
Is that your car out front?

05:31.208 --> 05:34.178
It... It could be.

05:34.212 --> 05:35.379
It was an
anonymous call.

05:35.413 --> 05:37.381
We need to search the vehicle.

05:40.118 --> 05:41.152
Hey, guys.

05:41.186 --> 05:42.152
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:42.187 --> 05:43.153
How was your match?

05:44.189 --> 05:45.322
It was brutal.

05:45.357 --> 05:47.058
He showed no mercy at all.

05:47.092 --> 05:49.093
Yeah. Win at all
costs, right, Dad?

05:49.128 --> 05:51.096
That's your sister, man.
Take it easy.

05:52.966 --> 05:54.066
Speaking of that, how's our
venture capitalist Terry?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.268
Any word?

05:55.302 --> 05:57.036
We got a meeting set up
with his boss on Monday.

05:57.070 --> 05:58.204
So, meanwhile, I'm just putting

05:58.238 --> 05:59.940
the finishing touches
on a prospectus.

05:59.974 --> 06:01.107
All right. Well, stay on it.

06:01.142 --> 06:02.976
Excuse me
a second, guys.

06:05.179 --> 06:07.280
So have you wished Sutton
a happy birthday yet?

06:07.315 --> 06:10.016
No, but I will.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.251
Hey, did she seem
at all strange to you

06:12.286 --> 06:14.086
the other night at dinner?

06:14.121 --> 06:16.155
Almost like she was fishing
around for something?

06:16.189 --> 06:19.024
Yeah. I noticed that.

06:19.059 --> 06:20.259
What do you got, Dan?

06:20.293 --> 06:22.227
It worked just like
you said it would.

06:22.262 --> 06:24.997
They picked up Derek Rogers.
He's on his way in.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.365
Okay, I'll be right there.

06:26.399 --> 06:28.067
And Dan...

06:28.101 --> 06:30.069
Yes?

06:30.103 --> 06:31.203
Good work.

06:31.238 --> 06:33.974
Thank you.

06:41.416 --> 06:43.985
- Hi!
- Hey.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.988
Mm! Well, aren't we
the sweaty one.

06:47.022 --> 06:49.023
Yeah, sorry.
Been at it awhile.

06:49.057 --> 06:53.193
Oh, no,
it's kind of, um... wow.

06:53.228 --> 06:55.029
The fam's in the big top,

06:55.063 --> 06:56.163
decorating for Sutton's
birthday party.

06:56.197 --> 06:57.898
You should come help.

06:57.932 --> 07:00.200
My mom actually
suggested it.

07:00.234 --> 07:02.135
What'd your dad say?

07:02.169 --> 07:05.037
He didn't say anything.

07:05.071 --> 07:07.339
What was he
supposed to say?

07:10.142 --> 07:12.010
I don't know.

07:12.045 --> 07:14.079
Well, that's a weird look.

07:14.113 --> 07:15.948
What's on your mind, handsome?
Spill.

07:17.184 --> 07:20.185
Would you hate me
if I skipped the party?

07:21.221 --> 07:24.189
No, but I'd be confused.

07:30.396 --> 07:32.164
Okay, not exactly
an explanation,

07:32.198 --> 07:33.331
but I'm not complaining.

07:33.366 --> 07:35.400
Just gotta trust me, Laurel.

07:35.434 --> 07:39.104
I'm never gonna let anything
come between us.

07:42.075 --> 07:43.342
You're a little low
on the right.

07:43.376 --> 07:45.077
I don't want to presume
to tell you your business.

07:45.112 --> 07:46.179
You're a little low
on the right.

07:46.213 --> 07:48.114
Perfect!
Thanks a lot, fellas.

07:50.151 --> 07:51.985
Hey!

07:52.020 --> 07:54.020
I didn't think we were gonna
see you till later, kiddo.

07:54.055 --> 07:55.088
Your only duty is
to show up tonight,

07:55.123 --> 07:56.990
and have a great time.
I know.

07:57.025 --> 07:58.158
I know you were expecting
to be on the lawn,

07:58.193 --> 08:00.127
but they were
predicting rain, so...

08:00.162 --> 08:02.363
Better safe than sorry.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.199
The cake, the cake!

08:04.233 --> 08:05.233
No, she can't
see the cake!

08:05.268 --> 08:07.035
In the kitchen.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.269
Well, now that you're here,
you can help.

08:08.304 --> 08:11.206
Char's bringing
a date, right?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.341
Uh, I'm not sure.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.343
I'll go with
"Guest" then.

08:18.213 --> 08:19.280
What?

08:21.349 --> 08:22.916
I wanted to tell you
something.

08:22.951 --> 08:25.285
It'll be kind of
crazy tonight,

08:25.319 --> 08:26.953
so I don't know if
I'll have the chance.

08:26.987 --> 08:28.989
So...

08:29.023 --> 08:32.994
these last few weeks
have been really great.

08:34.962 --> 08:37.299
How much you've taught me
and given me.

08:37.332 --> 08:40.135
Okay.

08:40.169 --> 08:43.006
It's not just that.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.944
I have all these new memories
like baking cookies and...

08:46.978 --> 08:49.981
and Homecoming...

08:50.015 --> 08:52.350
boyfriends.

08:52.384 --> 08:57.354
And I know how much you're
always there for me.

08:57.389 --> 09:00.891
I always have been
and I always will be.

09:00.926 --> 09:02.994
I know that, and I realize
how lucky I am.

09:03.028 --> 09:07.232
And how horrible my life
might've been

09:07.266 --> 09:10.035
if I wasn't here.

09:10.070 --> 09:12.938
And I know you value honesty.

09:12.972 --> 09:14.106
It's really everything,
isn't it?

09:14.140 --> 09:16.075
I'm with you on this.

09:16.109 --> 09:19.011
These last few weeks,
it's like we...

09:19.046 --> 09:22.082
we found it again.

09:22.116 --> 09:24.084
I look into your eyes, Sutton--

09:24.118 --> 09:25.252
it's the same eyes I looked into

09:25.286 --> 09:27.154
when you were
two days old--

09:27.188 --> 09:31.157
filled with such trust.

09:33.093 --> 09:38.263
We finally got that back
and I am so grateful.

09:39.432 --> 09:41.066
This is really hard.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.168
I don't think so.

09:43.202 --> 09:46.237
I think the key to love
is trust and...

09:46.271 --> 09:49.240
without that, what's left?

09:51.376 --> 09:53.411
Sweetie, your long face
is killing me.

09:53.445 --> 09:56.948
It is your birthday.
Cheer up.

09:59.051 --> 10:01.086
Hey, you mush heads,
come on.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.187
I think you're
jumping the gun.

10:02.221 --> 10:03.288
The party's not
till toni-- ooh!

10:03.322 --> 10:05.257
Ooh, hey, hey, sweetie.

10:06.426 --> 10:08.260
Sweetie, you okay?

10:11.997 --> 10:14.098
I'm fine.

10:14.132 --> 10:16.133
Dad, I know...

10:16.168 --> 10:18.035
that everything you do,

10:18.070 --> 10:20.104
and everything you have done,
it's for your family...

10:21.340 --> 10:23.107
...and for your daughters.

10:23.142 --> 10:26.210
I know that.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.288
Whoa! Easy there!

10:38.322 --> 10:40.390
What's up? You're so not
supposed to be here yet.

10:40.424 --> 10:43.193
I love you.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.294
Okay.

10:44.329 --> 10:45.295
Awkward.

10:45.330 --> 10:49.066
I just need to say it before...

10:49.100 --> 10:50.301
Before what?

10:50.335 --> 10:52.370
The end of the world--
is it near?

10:52.404 --> 10:55.272
Before things change.

10:55.307 --> 10:57.274
Okay, this is freaky.

10:57.309 --> 10:59.109
Is this, like, you're
pregnant or something?

10:59.144 --> 11:00.411
Dying?

11:00.445 --> 11:03.114
Just...

11:03.148 --> 11:06.050
you are amazing.

11:06.084 --> 11:08.052
Okay, that just got
frighteningly sincere,

11:08.086 --> 11:10.087
which could only mean
ulterior motive.

11:10.122 --> 11:12.090
Mm-mmm, not this time.

11:14.393 --> 11:15.960
Okay, well, just in case

11:15.995 --> 11:17.395
you had any
other ideas,

11:17.429 --> 11:20.131
Sutton Mercer better be
at her party tonight.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.333
She will.

11:23.169 --> 11:25.270
Guarantee it.

11:32.379 --> 11:36.081
I smell that desert air
and I know I'm home.

11:36.115 --> 11:37.316
How 'bout you?
Phoenix home for you?

11:37.350 --> 11:40.352
Yeah, it sure is.

11:40.386 --> 11:42.321
Actually, I'm home
for my birthday.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.288
I couldn't do it.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.671
Everything that Kristin
just said confirmed

12:04.672 --> 12:06.440
the way that she would react.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.576
She's all about trust
and-and

12:08.610 --> 12:12.579
honesty; two things that
I can never have with her.

12:12.614 --> 12:14.347
Okay, but you're running out
of time.

12:14.382 --> 12:16.583
I'll figure it out.

12:16.617 --> 12:21.186
Even if it means coming
face-to-face with Sutton.

12:21.221 --> 12:23.288
In fact, maybe that's the key.

12:23.322 --> 12:24.589
Uh, I don't know.

12:24.623 --> 12:26.524
What, you think
I can't handle her?

12:26.558 --> 12:29.660
She just doesn't always respond
well to direct confrontation.

12:29.694 --> 12:32.429
Well, I'm not just gonna run
away from her.

12:32.464 --> 12:34.198
I want to help you.

12:34.232 --> 12:37.235
I know.

12:37.269 --> 12:38.603
I just, I think
this is something

12:38.637 --> 12:41.339
I need to do by myself.

12:42.441 --> 12:44.409
Where are you going?

12:44.443 --> 12:46.577
To find her before
she finds me.

13:00.291 --> 13:03.427
You can't hold him like this.
He has rights.

13:03.461 --> 13:05.228
And you're, what,
his attorney?

13:05.262 --> 13:06.363
He doesn't have an attorney.

13:06.397 --> 13:07.564
Derek doesn't come from money.

13:07.598 --> 13:09.366
These days, who does?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.433
Char, enough of this.

13:10.467 --> 13:11.567
You're coming
home right now.

13:11.602 --> 13:13.603
I'm not going anywhere, Mother.

13:13.637 --> 13:16.172
Maybe you should, Char.

13:16.207 --> 13:17.407
Mr. Rybak, I'm here

13:17.441 --> 13:19.542
to vouch for Derek.
He didn't do anything wrong.

13:19.577 --> 13:22.178
Before you go any further,

13:22.213 --> 13:24.280
he's being released under
his own recognizance.

13:24.315 --> 13:25.548
Now, he's still
in serious trouble,

13:25.583 --> 13:27.384
but if he takes responsibility
for his actions,

13:27.418 --> 13:30.354
maybe I'll take it easy
on him.

13:30.388 --> 13:32.389
You should go home.

13:32.423 --> 13:34.258
Phyllis?

13:34.292 --> 13:35.359
Shall we?

13:35.393 --> 13:37.394
You go ahead, Mother.

13:37.428 --> 13:38.595
Char, this is no...

13:38.629 --> 13:41.298
You can't order me around, okay?

13:41.333 --> 13:42.599
You can't control me!

13:42.634 --> 13:45.302
Unless you want to drive me away
like you did your sister Annie!

13:46.571 --> 13:50.374
I told you I had nothing
to do with that.

13:51.643 --> 13:54.277
Nothing.

13:59.283 --> 14:00.317
Alec.

14:01.652 --> 14:03.453
Guessing this is about
that Derek kid?

14:03.487 --> 14:06.256
No, actually, it's about
that name I gave you,

14:06.290 --> 14:08.225
that woman Annie Hobbs.

14:08.259 --> 14:09.593
No sign of her yet.

14:09.627 --> 14:11.629
But with just a name
and a description

14:11.663 --> 14:14.198
to go on,
it's not gonna be easy.

14:14.232 --> 14:16.334
Well, you keep working on it.

14:17.269 --> 14:18.636
In the meantime...

14:18.670 --> 14:20.537
there's something else I need.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.448
Hello?

14:32.450 --> 14:34.651
Mother?

14:34.685 --> 14:37.554
Dad?

14:37.588 --> 14:39.389
Laurel?

14:39.423 --> 14:40.556
Anyone home?

14:42.659 --> 14:45.261
Mmm-mm...

14:49.265 --> 14:52.401
Hello, house!

14:52.436 --> 14:54.537
Hello, dining room.

14:54.571 --> 14:56.305
Hello, ugly painting.

14:56.340 --> 14:58.608
I have always hated it.

14:58.643 --> 15:01.144
Hello, fireplace.

15:05.517 --> 15:08.486
Hello, glorious closet!

15:08.520 --> 15:12.356
Hello, my room...

15:12.390 --> 15:15.225
and my friends...

15:15.259 --> 15:17.260
accessories and...

15:17.294 --> 15:20.630
multi-thread-count sheets!

15:20.664 --> 15:22.565
Oh!

15:39.684 --> 15:42.253
Hey, Emma.

15:43.522 --> 15:46.458
And hello, Ethan.

15:51.755 --> 15:53.255
I called.
You weren't picking up.

15:53.957 --> 15:56.024
Any luck?

15:56.059 --> 15:59.060
No, not really.

15:59.095 --> 16:01.329
I want to be with you for this,
all right?

16:01.364 --> 16:03.998
I can't just stand here on
the sidelines.

16:04.033 --> 16:09.237
Well, you're just gonna have
to, Ethan.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.172
Give me one reason why.

16:11.207 --> 16:14.176
Give me a reason why not.

16:14.210 --> 16:17.045
Because I love you.

16:18.147 --> 16:21.983
I love you, Emma.

16:22.018 --> 16:24.152
I probably have from
the moment I met you.

16:24.187 --> 16:27.022
I wanted to say it today
at the country club.

16:27.057 --> 16:30.193
I wanted to say it forever.

16:32.063 --> 16:33.396
And Sutton?

16:33.431 --> 16:35.966
I never loved her.
You know that.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.375
Uh, Ethan, I, uh...

16:44.410 --> 16:46.411
You don't have to say it.

16:46.445 --> 16:51.415
Every time I look at you
whenever we're together...

16:51.449 --> 16:53.251
it's there.

16:58.224 --> 17:00.925
I need to see you.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.894
I know.

17:02.928 --> 17:05.029
- I want this to be in person.
- Me, too.

17:07.965 --> 17:09.935
Meet me at the cabin?

17:12.003 --> 17:15.140
We haven't been there
since the night that we met.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.209
Right.

17:18.243 --> 17:20.078
Okay.

17:20.112 --> 17:23.180
In an hour I'll meet you there.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.049
I love you, Emma.

17:54.947 --> 17:56.947
♪ ♪

18:26.947 --> 18:28.147
♪ ♪

18:44.061 --> 18:46.096
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

18:46.130 --> 18:49.266
Okay, enough
micromanaging for the day.

18:49.301 --> 18:51.101
- We better get home and change.
- Mm-hmm.

18:51.136 --> 18:54.038
Plus I think I'm driving
everybody crazy.

18:54.072 --> 18:56.340
No different than the nurses
at the hospital, I'm sure.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.276
Oh.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.144
Um, can I ask you
something, Daddy?

19:00.179 --> 19:02.080
No, absolutely not.

19:02.114 --> 19:03.314
As my offspring,
you're never permitted

19:03.349 --> 19:05.183
to ask me a question, so...

19:05.218 --> 19:07.152
What did you say to Justin
the other day

19:07.186 --> 19:10.055
when you had your little chat?

19:10.089 --> 19:12.190
Why? What'd he say I said?

19:12.225 --> 19:15.026
Hey, I am the one asking
the questions here.

19:15.061 --> 19:16.327
Okay, if you must know,

19:16.362 --> 19:19.096
it was an awkward conversation
between a father and the boy

19:19.131 --> 19:21.132
who's gotten way too close
to his daughter.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.101
And the father showed
incredible restraint

19:24.136 --> 19:25.269
and modern-day sensitivity

19:25.303 --> 19:27.371
and behaved rather admirably,
I think.

19:27.406 --> 19:29.373
Can we not kid around here?

19:29.408 --> 19:31.175
He's been acting
really weird lately.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.044
He even said he might not come
to the party tonight.

19:33.079 --> 19:34.212
Well, that's ridiculous.
Of course he's coming.

19:34.247 --> 19:35.948
He has to come,
he's your boyfriend!

19:35.982 --> 19:38.951
He lives above the clubhouse!
He has to be come.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.353
Can I quote you on that?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.022
No, no, I will deny it.

19:43.057 --> 19:46.360
I love you so much, Daddy.

19:47.428 --> 19:50.263
- Uh!
- All right.

19:50.297 --> 19:52.032
Okay, let's go already.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.142
Sutton...

20:01.177 --> 20:02.410
look at you!

20:02.445 --> 20:04.313
It's exquisite,
if I do say so myself.

20:04.347 --> 20:06.014
It just fits you
so beautifully.

20:06.049 --> 20:07.349
The shoes, the bow
how it...

20:07.383 --> 20:09.184
Uh, you don't...

20:09.218 --> 20:11.086
have to do that.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.421
I'm... sorry.

20:13.456 --> 20:17.058
I was just... going for...

20:17.092 --> 20:18.960
mmm, perfection.

20:18.995 --> 20:21.129
Like always.

20:23.332 --> 20:26.234
Look, thanks, Mother. Mom.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.403
I'm gonna make a quick stop,

20:29.438 --> 20:31.404
and then I'll see you
at the party.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.047
Whoo... very nice.

20:42.082 --> 20:43.982
Beautiful.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.017
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

20:45.051 --> 20:46.251
They are gonna be lining up.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.020
Oh, I don't know

20:48.055 --> 20:50.456
if I'm really ready
for that, actually.

20:50.491 --> 20:53.059
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
I forgot.

20:53.093 --> 20:55.262
So, shall we take
one car?

20:55.296 --> 20:57.398
Yeah. Uh, no, actually.

20:57.986 --> 20:59.787
You guys should probably
drive yourselves.

20:59.821 --> 21:02.657
You're probably gonna want
to stay later than I am,

21:02.692 --> 21:04.826
and I still gotta pick up
Sutton's gift, so...

21:04.860 --> 21:06.562
Oh. What'd you get her?

21:06.596 --> 21:10.632
Uh, it wouldn't be a surprise
if I told you,

21:10.666 --> 21:12.667
now would it?

21:12.701 --> 21:14.569
T...

21:15.670 --> 21:17.804
why don't you take
the convertible?

21:17.839 --> 21:19.940
Be nice to get back
into a real car.

21:19.974 --> 21:23.743
Especially after that clunker
you were driving in L.A.

21:23.778 --> 21:26.946
What kind of a paintless wagon
was that?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.982
All right, you look
beautiful, honey.

21:29.016 --> 21:30.717
- Thanks.
- I'll see you at the party.

21:30.751 --> 21:31.718
Okay.

21:31.752 --> 21:33.586
Lipstick,

21:33.621 --> 21:35.822
and then we can go.

21:35.856 --> 21:37.857
Uh-oh, know that look.

21:39.693 --> 21:42.896
Mads, did I ever tell you
what I was driving in L.A.?

21:42.930 --> 21:45.699
The station wagon?

21:45.733 --> 21:47.601
No, not that I remember.

21:47.636 --> 21:50.538
Is it still in L.A.?

21:50.572 --> 21:54.543
Yeah. Yeah, it's still there.

21:57.748 --> 21:59.715
I'm so excited...

22:46.730 --> 22:49.965
You look beautiful.

22:49.999 --> 22:53.602
Thank you.

22:53.637 --> 22:55.671
So you're gonna go to the party?

22:55.705 --> 22:58.707
Yes.

22:58.741 --> 23:01.843
But I wanted to come here first.

23:01.878 --> 23:05.680
All right. All right, well,
I'll come with you.

23:05.715 --> 23:07.483
We can face them together.

23:09.785 --> 23:11.687
Do we have to talk
about this now?

23:12.756 --> 23:15.592
No.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.902
Oh, I want you.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.287
Oh, my God.

23:54.201 --> 23:55.367
Sutton.

23:55.402 --> 23:59.105
Right on the first guess!

23:59.139 --> 24:00.405
All it takes

24:00.440 --> 24:02.207
is a kiss, right, Emma?

24:02.242 --> 24:04.343
What is wrong with you?!

24:04.377 --> 24:06.011
You set this whole thing up?!

24:06.045 --> 24:08.013
Oh, yeah, that's it,

24:08.048 --> 24:10.115
run, Emma.

24:10.150 --> 24:12.050
Isn't that what
you always do?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.953
Run?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.388
All I have done is stay.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.991
Stay here, be you.

24:21.025 --> 24:24.194
I wanted to get to you
before you got to them!

24:24.229 --> 24:25.962
Why is that?

24:25.997 --> 24:27.230
I read the letter
to your mother.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.132
Oh, reading other people's
mail now!

24:29.166 --> 24:31.000
What is that, like,
a federal offense?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.268
You're just stacking
'em up!

24:32.302 --> 24:35.137
Why won't you listen to her,
all right?

24:35.172 --> 24:37.139
She did everything for you!

24:37.173 --> 24:38.307
She took your spoiled

24:38.341 --> 24:41.044
selfish life
and turned it around!

24:41.078 --> 24:44.081
Not just with your family, but
with Char and Thayer and Mads!

24:44.115 --> 24:46.016
And you.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.452
Especially you,
right, Ethan?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.254
Stop it!

24:51.323 --> 24:54.025
Ethan...

24:54.060 --> 24:57.295
she's not gonna
listen to you or me.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.197
It's over.

24:59.232 --> 25:04.103
Yeah, hmm, actually,
it's not <i>over...</i>

25:04.137 --> 25:05.337
Emma.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.339
Because when you steal

25:07.373 --> 25:09.240
someone else's life,

25:09.275 --> 25:11.242
there's always a price.

25:11.276 --> 25:14.245
From the moment
you stepped into my shoes,

25:14.279 --> 25:18.249
it is always been about making
your orphan dreams come true.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.118
What did you think?

25:20.152 --> 25:22.053
That you just deserved
all of this?

25:22.088 --> 25:24.424
You know, in Vegas
I got a chance

25:24.458 --> 25:26.226
to walk around in your shoes.

25:26.260 --> 25:29.095
Cool place,
tons of opportunities,

25:29.130 --> 25:31.197
but you just didn't really seem
to take advantage

25:31.232 --> 25:34.167
because, what, it's just easier
to steal my life?

25:34.202 --> 25:35.969
She did not steal
your life.

25:36.004 --> 25:37.404
You gave it to her!

25:37.439 --> 25:40.341
Great, Ethan, blame me

25:40.375 --> 25:43.143
for you falling in love
with her.

25:43.178 --> 25:45.446
Justify cheating
by making me the villain.

25:45.481 --> 25:47.248
Just tell me,
exactly how long

25:47.282 --> 25:49.250
have the two of you
been sleeping together?

25:49.284 --> 25:52.320
Oh, we didn't have to sleep
together to fall in love.

25:52.354 --> 25:56.124
Oh! Saving it for marriage?

25:56.158 --> 25:56.991
Stop it!

25:57.026 --> 25:59.194
All I wanted

25:59.228 --> 26:03.064
was for this to be over...

26:03.098 --> 26:07.034
for us to be sisters, Sutton.

26:07.069 --> 26:08.936
Real sisters.

26:12.207 --> 26:14.241
But that was never the idea,
was it?

26:14.276 --> 26:19.413
Actually... it was...

26:19.448 --> 26:23.417
but you screwed
it up.

26:23.451 --> 26:27.388
You are a vindictive
little bitch.

26:27.422 --> 26:32.293
God, there's that
twin thing again.

26:32.327 --> 26:36.030
'Cause I was just about
to call you the same thing.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.269
Night, kids.

26:42.303 --> 26:45.038
You're finished here.

26:48.409 --> 26:51.210
Hey, didn't you
hear me honking?

26:51.245 --> 26:54.080
Derek's not coming.

26:54.114 --> 26:57.250
He left a message.
Something he had to do.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.252
I swear, it had something
to do with your dad.

27:01.356 --> 27:03.958
Our father tried
to help Derek.

27:03.993 --> 27:06.127
The guy's a
screw-up, Char.

27:06.162 --> 27:09.932
He's not. He's cute
and amazing and... amazing.

27:09.967 --> 27:12.035
And I know
I said that twice,

27:12.069 --> 27:13.336
but it just shows how deep
my feelings are.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.172
But to say that our dad
is somehow using Derek...

27:16.207 --> 27:17.374
Mads, it's possible.

27:17.408 --> 27:19.209
There's no way
he could have known

27:19.243 --> 27:20.944
what car I drove
in L.A.

27:20.979 --> 27:22.279
unless he'd been there.

27:22.313 --> 27:24.214
We thought that someone
had broken in.

27:24.248 --> 27:26.115
Okay, so what now?

27:26.150 --> 27:27.350
Our dad's a burglar?

27:27.385 --> 27:28.985
Look, I'm just
thinking out loud.

27:29.020 --> 27:31.054
Why don't you think
to yourself?

27:31.088 --> 27:32.989
Come on. Let's go.
We're gonna be late.

27:35.093 --> 27:37.061
I heard a "we" in there.

27:37.095 --> 27:40.164
Thought you were alone in L.A.
Was there some girl?

27:40.199 --> 27:44.236
Yeah, many, many girls.

27:44.270 --> 27:46.205
Mmm...

27:46.239 --> 27:49.408
Are you sure you can
dance in those things?

27:56.984 --> 27:59.185
You need to fight!
You need to fight this!

27:59.219 --> 28:00.286
Why?

28:00.320 --> 28:02.988
Everything Sutton just said
was true!

28:03.023 --> 28:06.225
Her family, her friends,
they will believe her!

28:06.259 --> 28:08.327
I don't stand
a chance against her.

28:08.361 --> 28:09.995
Ethan, I'm leaving.

28:10.029 --> 28:11.329
I'm gonna go back to Vegas
or wherever.

28:11.364 --> 28:12.330
All right, then

28:12.365 --> 28:13.932
I'll come with you!

28:13.966 --> 28:14.366
No!

28:14.400 --> 28:15.333
Damn it, Emma!

28:15.368 --> 28:17.169
Ethan, this is over!

28:18.338 --> 28:21.173
How do you not get that?

28:21.208 --> 28:23.243
You have a life here,

28:23.277 --> 28:25.211
a brother, a job.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.380
I don't care about any of that!

28:26.414 --> 28:27.981
I want you!

28:28.016 --> 28:29.116
It doesn't matter.

28:29.150 --> 28:31.085
I love you!

28:34.289 --> 28:37.058
Ethan, what we had
was incredible

28:37.092 --> 28:39.326
and magical.

28:39.361 --> 28:41.361
You and me were not meant
to happen.

28:41.396 --> 28:45.332
I can't let you just
walk out of my life.

28:45.366 --> 28:48.234
Okay?

28:48.269 --> 28:49.436
I mean it.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.374
I can't let you do this.

28:55.409 --> 28:58.278
I'm doing it.

29:26.841 --> 29:29.977
So, this is either Emma
or it's Sutton.

29:30.012 --> 29:32.046
Or it's Sutton pretending
to be Emma.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.981
Or it's Emma pretending
to be Sutton.

29:34.016 --> 29:36.717
It's me, goofball;
the real Emma.

29:36.752 --> 29:39.820
I know Sutton stayed with you.

29:39.855 --> 29:42.056
Yeah. Look, it thought
about calling and warning you,

29:42.091 --> 29:44.992
but I kinda figured whatever
needed to happen should happen.

29:45.026 --> 29:49.830
Well, hell hath no fury
like a twin scorned.

29:49.864 --> 29:52.098
I'm coming home, Lex.

29:55.702 --> 29:57.770
She's gonna expose me
to the family...

29:57.805 --> 30:01.874
show that I'm an impostor.

30:01.908 --> 30:05.010
Basically, hurt them
just to hurt me

30:05.045 --> 30:08.014
God, that sucks!

30:08.048 --> 30:09.849
I got a pretty good sense
of Sutton

30:09.883 --> 30:11.117
when she was here, and...

30:11.151 --> 30:13.687
I don't know.
I know what you were looking for

30:13.721 --> 30:16.757
when you went over there:
a sister

30:16.791 --> 30:18.726
and a family.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.861
It was just a silly dream.

30:20.896 --> 30:24.032
Only if you run away from it.

30:24.066 --> 30:28.035
Lex, I really appreciate
the encouragement, but...

30:28.070 --> 30:29.937
Look, I just really and

30:29.971 --> 30:32.773
truly believe that Sutton
is a crazy force of nature.

30:32.807 --> 30:36.142
But I also think that the only
way she's gonna accept you is

30:36.176 --> 30:38.144
if you stand up to her.

30:38.178 --> 30:40.145
Yeah, I tried that.

30:40.180 --> 30:41.714
Got ugly, did it?

30:41.748 --> 30:42.948
Way ugly.

30:42.983 --> 30:46.818
Well, nothing good ever happens
without a fight, right?

30:46.853 --> 30:51.023
Ems, maybe what you're looking
for is there, not here.

30:52.993 --> 30:55.028
♪ ♪

30:59.167 --> 31:02.803
Crazy, look at this place. Wow!

31:02.837 --> 31:05.072
Poor guy, he doesn't
get out much.

31:05.106 --> 31:07.108
Ooh! Love the bracelet.

31:07.142 --> 31:11.045
Oh, thanks. Just a little gift
from my squeeze.

31:11.079 --> 31:13.747
Hey, that's
between us.

31:13.782 --> 31:15.816
So, why is Sutton
not here yet?

31:15.850 --> 31:17.951
Uh, always fashionably late.

31:17.985 --> 31:18.952
Mmm...

31:20.821 --> 31:21.955
And look
who's obnoxiously early.

31:21.989 --> 31:24.123
I'll take care of this.

31:25.192 --> 31:26.993
This nasty crashing habit

31:27.027 --> 31:28.828
really needs to stop.

31:28.862 --> 31:31.831
- Who says I wasn't invited?
- I'd be happy to say it.

31:31.865 --> 31:34.934
Well, for your information,
Sutton invited me.

31:34.968 --> 31:36.168
Called me yesterday

31:36.202 --> 31:38.136
and said it was time
we all made peace.

31:38.171 --> 31:40.872
She never told me that.

31:40.907 --> 31:43.141
God, I hope that
wasn't the reason.

31:43.175 --> 31:44.842
Come on, guys.

31:44.877 --> 31:46.978
Let's go check out
that obscene pile of gifts.

31:47.012 --> 31:49.948
Remember last year
when she actually registered?

31:52.719 --> 31:54.853
Guys, Thayer, Justin,

31:54.887 --> 31:57.656
glad you decided
to join us.

31:57.690 --> 32:00.659
Well, I couldn't let Laurel
down, now could I?

32:00.693 --> 32:03.729
Justin, you know, the other day,
you said some things...

32:03.763 --> 32:06.098
I want to apologize. In my life

32:06.133 --> 32:09.035
I have trouble finding
adults that I can trust

32:09.069 --> 32:11.838
as much as my mother and father.

32:11.873 --> 32:14.141
They tend to suspect
people of things.

32:14.175 --> 32:16.811
Do you suspect me of anything?

32:16.845 --> 32:19.747
No. No, not at all.

32:19.782 --> 32:23.118
Justin, is Dr. Mercer
giving you a hard time?

32:23.153 --> 32:24.854
No, ma'am.

32:24.888 --> 32:25.988
If you guys will excuse me,

32:26.022 --> 32:27.890
I think that Laurel is looking
for me.

32:27.924 --> 32:30.759
I think she is.

32:32.895 --> 32:34.697
You two guys okay?

32:34.731 --> 32:36.132
Honestly, I don't know

32:36.166 --> 32:37.967
There's just
something strange.

32:38.001 --> 32:39.868
You feel it, too, right?

32:39.903 --> 32:42.104
No. When I look
at Justin,

32:42.138 --> 32:45.707
I see a boy madly in love
with Laurel.

32:45.742 --> 32:47.142
And yes, it scares me,

32:47.176 --> 32:52.046
but it's so wonderful
to see how happy she is.

32:52.081 --> 32:53.848
We finally have things
with Dad under control,

32:53.883 --> 32:56.851
and you have to start
again with all these suspicions.

32:56.885 --> 32:59.020
All Dad wants is for us
to be together.

32:59.054 --> 33:00.688
Just a real family.

33:00.722 --> 33:01.923
And honestly,
that's all I want to.

33:01.957 --> 33:03.658
Okay.

33:03.692 --> 33:05.026
Look, it's one thing
to want that,

33:05.061 --> 33:07.996
and it's another thing to bury
your heads in the sand.

33:10.133 --> 33:11.767
I'll be right back.

33:13.737 --> 33:15.905
Who are you looking for,
Emma or Sutton?

33:15.939 --> 33:17.707
Emma's not coming.

33:17.742 --> 33:19.142
I figured Sutton
would already be here.

33:19.177 --> 33:20.977
So you know she's in Phoenix?

33:21.012 --> 33:23.047
We saw her at the cabin.

33:23.081 --> 33:24.882
Now I'm pretty sure
she's coming here

33:24.916 --> 33:26.683
to drop her last bomb.

33:26.718 --> 33:28.718
And I'm assuming
you want to stop her.

33:28.753 --> 33:31.054
Somebody's got to.

34:26.163 --> 34:28.295
You're here!
Finally!

34:28.475 --> 34:29.601
We were worried.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.085
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

34:31.085 --> 34:32.820
- Thank you.
- Why are you all wet?

34:32.853 --> 34:35.155
- Is it raining outside?
- Yeah.

34:35.190 --> 34:36.857
You're wearing a different
dress, sweetie?

34:36.891 --> 34:37.991
Was it 'cause I was
fussing too much?

34:38.025 --> 34:40.927
I get it.
You don't like it.

34:40.962 --> 34:42.195
No, I loved it.

34:42.230 --> 34:45.197
I... it was...
the seam had a tear.

34:45.232 --> 34:46.933
Excuse me.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.938
There's the
birthday girl.

34:52.974 --> 34:54.141
Come on, I know
it's your birthday,

34:54.175 --> 34:57.211
but we got a schedule here--
dancing, cake, come on.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.946
Wait, are you okay?

34:58.980 --> 35:00.982
Yeah. Just a crazy day.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.184
Dad, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

35:08.223 --> 35:09.891
It's me.

35:09.925 --> 35:11.927
You didn't leave?

35:11.961 --> 35:13.127
You were right.

35:13.162 --> 35:15.997
I need to stand up for myself.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.131
I don't get it.
Why isn't she here?

35:17.165 --> 35:19.099
She left before us.

35:19.134 --> 35:20.867
I have no idea where she is.

35:20.902 --> 35:24.004
Look, Emma, what you said
at the cabin...

35:24.038 --> 35:25.872
Do you love me?

35:25.906 --> 35:27.006
You know I do.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.808
Then it doesn't matter.

35:28.843 --> 35:32.044
It doesn't matter because...

whatever happens tonight
or tomorrow,

35:33.981 --> 35:36.116

39:42.727 --> 39:47.898
the truth about
who I really am.

39:53.906 --> 39:55.907
The truth is...

40:05.952 --> 40:08.621
And that truth is...

40:08.655 --> 40:10.823
I love you.

40:12.659 --> 40:14.726
Each and every one.

40:18.663 --> 40:19.797
Excuse me.

40:27.839 --> 40:30.575
Sutton, is that you?

40:37.883 --> 40:40.617
Sutton...
what are you doing out here?

40:44.889 --> 40:46.657
Annie...?

41:03.644 --> 41:07.644
