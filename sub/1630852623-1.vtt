WEBVTT

00:01.005 --> 00:02.018
It's so good to be back.

00:02.020 --> 00:05.000
We know how much you have missed
The Amazing Race,

00:05.002 --> 00:07.014
and believe me, we have missed
making it for you.

00:07.016 --> 00:10.025
Tonight's episode was filmed
before the outbreak of COVID-19,

00:10.027 --> 00:13.011
which prompted us
to suspend shooting

00:13.013 --> 00:15.008
at the end of the third leg.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.029
I am excited to tell you
that after a long break,

00:18.001 --> 00:21.011
we did finish shooting
this season, and once again,

00:21.013 --> 00:23.008
the world is waiting for you,

00:23.010 --> 00:28.005
so sit back, relax and enjoy
The Amazing Race.

00:28.007 --> 00:30.015
All across America,

00:30.017 --> 00:34.002
11 teams from all walks of life
are packing up

00:34.004 --> 00:36.011
to head out
on an epic adventure.

00:36.013 --> 00:38.029
-That's just for style.
-You got to stay stylish
on the run.

00:39.001 --> 00:40.005
You got to bring two pair
of shoes.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.021
We've seen racers lose
a pair of shoes.

00:41.023 --> 00:44.002
Yay, my size 11s fit.

00:44.004 --> 00:46.007
(phones chiming)

00:46.009 --> 00:48.006
Hmm.

00:48.008 --> 00:50.016
-We got a message.
-All right.

00:50.018 --> 00:51.027
-Oh, it's Phil.
-It's Phil.

00:51.029 --> 00:53.027
You're about to embark on a race

00:53.029 --> 00:54.029
around the world.

00:55.001 --> 00:56.006
Ooh!

00:56.008 --> 00:57.026
-Cool!
-Oh, my God!

00:57.028 --> 01:00.016
Your first clue is hidden
in London, England

01:00.018 --> 01:02.011
here at Trafalgar Square.

01:02.013 --> 01:04.001
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

01:04.003 --> 01:05.022
-What?
-London!

01:05.024 --> 01:09.002
When I say go, grab your bags

01:09.004 --> 01:10.011
and make your way
to the nearest airport

01:10.013 --> 01:11.017
to catch a flight.

01:11.019 --> 01:12.026
Oh, my God, it's starting.

01:12.028 --> 01:14.028
The world is waiting for you.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.027
Good luck.

01:16.029 --> 01:18.000
Travel safe.

01:18.002 --> 01:19.023
-Here it is.
-He's gonna say "Go."

01:19.025 --> 01:21.017
Go!

01:21.019 --> 01:25.016
-Go! Here we go.
-Bye.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.001
-Go.
-(screaming)

01:28.003 --> 01:29.005
(laughing)

01:29.007 --> 01:30.022
-Come on. Go, go.
-Oh, my God.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.001
You gonna be great in practice,
all right?

01:32.003 --> 01:34.002
-All right.
-Do your thing.

01:34.004 --> 01:37.017
(overlapping chatter)

01:37.019 --> 01:39.008
-Bye, Meemaw.Te quiero.
-Bye.

01:39.010 --> 01:40.023
-Mwah.
-(speaks indistinctly)

01:40.025 --> 01:42.009
-He said "go."
-Come on, let's go.

01:42.011 --> 01:43.026
Got to get to LAX.

01:43.028 --> 01:46.011
Let's go. (laughs)

01:46.013 --> 01:47.011
It's starting.

01:47.013 --> 01:51.018
(applause and cheering)

01:51.020 --> 01:53.003
-Bye, baby.
-Bye.

01:53.005 --> 01:55.002
-Go! Go!
-Go, go, go.
-Okay, okay, okay, come on.

01:55.004 --> 01:57.001
-Go!
-Bye!

01:58.026 --> 02:00.016
(laughter)

02:00.018 --> 02:03.011
-Let's go.
-Yes.

02:03.013 --> 02:05.011
London, here we go.

02:05.013 --> 02:07.013
Let's go. Come on.

02:07.015 --> 02:09.028
All right,
we need to get to LAX.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.029
Yeah, so, we going to JFK
in New York.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.014
Take us to the airport.
Thank you.

02:13.016 --> 02:14.025
Airport as fast as possible.
We're in a race.

02:14.027 --> 02:16.010
-I can't believe it.
-I cannot believe it.

02:16.012 --> 02:18.015
-Oh, my gosh.
This is happening now.
-Now.

02:18.017 --> 02:20.010
-Like right now.
-Straight to London.

02:20.012 --> 02:21.029
(British accent):
We're gonna have some tea
and some...

02:22.001 --> 02:23.016
some biscuits
and stuff like that.

02:24.021 --> 02:26.017
-Oh, my gosh.
-Ooh, it's go time.

02:26.019 --> 02:28.008
I've got butterflies
all in my belly.

02:28.010 --> 02:31.002
BOTH:
We're going to London!

02:31.004 --> 02:32.015
CAYLA:
Place we've already been.

02:32.017 --> 02:33.029
RAQUEL: We're gonna win
a million dollars.

02:34.001 --> 02:35.028
-100%. We're calling it now.
-Wow.

It sounds like they're saying...

02:45.011 --> 02:47.004
We think it says "oatmeal."
Is that what the word is?

02:47.006 --> 02:49.018

03:17.010 --> 03:20.001

03:38.023 --> 03:39.026
We're so excited.

03:39.028 --> 03:41.021
Buckingham Palace?
I wonder if we're gonna go there

03:41.023 --> 03:43.026
and meet the royals,
the queen. Hey!

03:43.028 --> 03:46.008
ARUN:
We're going to London!

03:46.010 --> 03:48.011
NATALIA:
We have been to London before.

03:48.013 --> 03:51.000
So we have some bearing
of where things are.

03:51.002 --> 03:53.010
I am actually excited.
I know these are tears.

03:53.012 --> 03:55.010
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
miss my kids madly,

03:55.012 --> 03:58.007
but I am excited
and a little terrified.

03:58.009 --> 04:00.005
AKBAR:
See ya, Jersey. I'm out of here.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.017
We've never been out
of the country, so...

04:01.019 --> 04:03.022
London, England. I'm gonna
get my accent right.

04:03.024 --> 04:05.024
AKBAR:
Just being able to have the kids
of Newark watch

04:05.026 --> 04:08.012
people that look like them,
sound like them

04:08.014 --> 04:11.006
go see parts of the world,
no, this is, like, surreal.

04:11.008 --> 04:13.025
We met in college.
We both played basketball.

04:13.027 --> 04:16.014
And we've been married
for 17 years.

04:16.016 --> 04:17.026
I started off
teaching elementary school,

04:17.028 --> 04:19.025
and I became
an administrator in high school.

04:19.027 --> 04:21.011
Then we got the news
that I was going to West Side,

04:21.013 --> 04:24.020
and at West Side
there was violence, drugs, guns.

04:24.022 --> 04:26.012
It literally was
the worst school

04:26.014 --> 04:28.008
in the state of New Jersey.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.026
So I said, "You know what?
I'm gonna open up my school

04:29.028 --> 04:33.002
from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.
to be a safe haven for them."

04:33.004 --> 04:36.005
-There it is... Oh! (laughs)
-ALL: Oh!

04:36.007 --> 04:38.020
SHERI:
I run the kitchen.
On any given night, we can feed

04:38.022 --> 04:41.000
300 to 500 people.

04:41.002 --> 04:42.020
AKBAR:
We named the program
Lights On, and then

04:42.022 --> 04:45.002
Oprah Winfrey came
and gave us $500,000.

04:45.004 --> 04:46.015
Since we started
the Lights On program

04:46.017 --> 04:47.025
during the school year,

04:47.027 --> 04:49.019
I haven't lost any more kids
to gun violence.

04:50.025 --> 04:52.010
-All right, let's go.
-Thank you.

04:54.009 --> 04:56.010
Oh, I think I see some people.

04:56.012 --> 04:57.028
-Oh, what's up?
-How you doing?
-What's up, what's up?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.016
-How's it going?
-What's your name?

04:59.018 --> 05:00.026
-Taylor.
-What's yours?

05:00.028 --> 05:02.012
-Isaiah. Isaiah.
-Isaiah. Spencer.

05:02.014 --> 05:04.016
-So, what's y'all's story?
-Yeah.

05:04.018 --> 05:06.002
-ANTHONY:
Just best friends, basically.
-Yeah.

05:06.004 --> 05:07.016
We've known each other
since we were 12, actually.

05:07.018 --> 05:09.008
So we've-we've traveled together
a lot.

05:09.010 --> 05:12.024
In, like, 2015, we were
backpacking through Europe,

05:12.026 --> 05:14.019
and that terrorist was
on the train that we were on.

05:14.021 --> 05:15.028
-What?
-Wow.
-Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.001
We turned around to see

05:17.003 --> 05:19.012
a shirtless man holding
an AK-47.

05:19.014 --> 05:22.029
I decided to run at him, uh,
and he pointed the gun at me,

05:23.001 --> 05:25.002
pulled the trigger.
It didn't go off.

05:25.004 --> 05:27.027
I tackled him. He hit me
in the face with the gun.

05:27.029 --> 05:29.019
You know, busted my face open
pretty good.

05:29.021 --> 05:31.017
At that moment,
thoughts just took over my head

05:31.019 --> 05:33.026
-just to help my friend.
-You know, me and Anthony

05:33.028 --> 05:35.000
are just punching him,
kicking him.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.008
And I was finally able
to choke him unconscious.

05:37.010 --> 05:38.028
He sliced me up
a couple of times, and...

05:39.000 --> 05:41.027
-Okay.
-With a knife?
-With a box cutter.

05:41.029 --> 05:43.024
Almost cut my thumb off.

05:43.026 --> 05:46.027
Life was just insane
right after the attack.

05:46.029 --> 05:50.013
Within 24 hours,
it was international news.

05:50.015 --> 05:53.000
We got the Legion of Honor
from the French president.

05:53.002 --> 05:54.024
ANTHONY: Clint Eastwood
decided to make, um,

05:54.026 --> 05:56.018
a movie about it--
The 15:17 to Paris.

05:56.020 --> 05:59.012
SPENCER:
We even acted
in the movie as ourselves.

05:59.014 --> 06:01.008
The things we've been through
and what we've experienced--

06:01.010 --> 06:05.003
I would say we have a closer
bond than any relationship here.

06:05.005 --> 06:07.015
It's only right
that we're doing this together.

06:07.017 --> 06:09.026
Wow. Like, I can...
I can even thank y'all.

06:09.028 --> 06:11.010
I wasn't there, but, geez,

06:11.012 --> 06:12.016
y'all saved a lot
of people, man.

06:12.018 --> 06:14.001
-Thank you.
-That's amazing.

06:16.021 --> 06:18.021
-Got it?
-Yup. Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.021
Someone else is here.
Another team is here.

06:23.023 --> 06:25.016
-(laughing)
-KIM: We have some friends.

06:27.006 --> 06:29.018
-So, I want to know
everything about you.
-(laughter)

06:29.020 --> 06:33.023
So, we are flight attendants.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.010
-You're hot flight attendants.
-Oh, yeah, that's the thing.

06:35.012 --> 06:36.026
-Oh, my gosh.
-No, no, it's just...

06:36.028 --> 06:38.008
No, it's more like
we're a hot mess.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.020
-Hot mess flight attendants.
-Flight attendants.

06:40.022 --> 06:43.007
RAQUEL:
Cayla and I met
at work in training.

06:43.009 --> 06:45.012
-We literally just hit it off.
-Instant connection.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.015
Uh, we were kind of two peas
in a pod.

06:47.017 --> 06:48.019
CAYLA:
Raquel was like, "Anyone need
to go get some wine?"

06:48.021 --> 06:50.021
And I was like, "Her."

06:50.023 --> 06:52.025
-I want to be friends with you.
-I mean, we love what we do,

06:52.027 --> 06:54.011
but we don't make a lot
of money.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.007
Even more incentive to want
to winThe Amazing Race.

06:56.009 --> 06:58.021
I think being flight attendants,
there's a lot of advantages.

06:58.023 --> 07:00.004
You know, it's
the common sense stuff of, like,

07:00.006 --> 07:01.026
navigating through airports,

07:01.028 --> 07:04.012
navigating through cities
you've never been in before.

07:04.014 --> 07:06.016
People are gonna underestimate
the heck out of us.

07:06.018 --> 07:08.020
I want you to think I'm this
girl that's like, "Oh, my God,

07:08.022 --> 07:10.000
I broke a nail.
I can't do this."

07:10.002 --> 07:12.022
I had to take mine down,
which is so unfortunate.

07:12.024 --> 07:15.025
Oh, they're disgusting now.
(laughs)

07:17.008 --> 07:20.002
-What's the relationship here?
-Childhood friends

07:20.004 --> 07:22.011
-since 24 years roughly, so...
-Yup.

07:22.013 --> 07:24.011
-Oh, that's awesome!
-Yeah.

07:24.013 --> 07:26.003
So-so-so...
so what did you guys do?

07:26.005 --> 07:27.027
-So, right?
-It's what we didn't do,
like, uh...

07:27.029 --> 07:29.021
I was actually
wrongfully convicted

07:29.023 --> 07:31.007
of a crime
I didn't commit, obviously.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.018
-Really?
-Yeah.
-Wrongfully convicted, yeah.

07:32.020 --> 07:34.023
When I was 19,
I was leaving school.

07:34.025 --> 07:36.011
I was surrounded by a SWAT team.

07:36.013 --> 07:37.022
They arrested me for murder

07:37.024 --> 07:39.002
of a person
that I had never seen,

07:39.004 --> 07:40.020
that I had never talked to.

07:40.022 --> 07:42.011
I thought, "Okay,
you're gonna interrogate me,

07:42.013 --> 07:43.026
"see I wasn't there, and then

07:43.028 --> 07:45.003
I'm gonna go home
and take midterms."

07:45.005 --> 07:47.006
I didn't go home for a decade.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.013
The fact that Dusty stuck by me
that whole time

07:49.015 --> 07:51.006
was the most incredible thing
I can imagine.

07:51.008 --> 07:53.008
DUSTY:
It was a no-brainer for me.
He's like my brother.

07:53.010 --> 07:55.021
What happened to me has happened
to so many other people.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.026
Part of the reason that
I'm here-- I want to humanize

07:57.028 --> 07:59.012
the wrongfully convicted
individuals

07:59.014 --> 08:00.026
who don't have a voice.

08:00.028 --> 08:03.001
We could not be more excited
to run the race.

08:03.003 --> 08:04.024
It's an opportunity
to make up for lost time.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.026
-All right.
-Yeah, let's do it, man.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.004
MICHAEL:
So we've got to keep our eye
on everybody.

08:09.006 --> 08:10.012
Obviously, we're not
underestimating anybody,

08:10.014 --> 08:13.005
you know, but we got
our eyes open, man.

08:13.007 --> 08:14.018
-We're racing. Yeah.
-Game on, baby.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.010
-Game on.
-No turning back.

08:16.012 --> 08:17.021
Hey, it's Lulu and Lala.

08:17.023 --> 08:18.025
LALA:
Headed to London.

08:18.027 --> 08:20.003
What are we gonna be doing?

08:20.005 --> 08:21.001
LULU AND LALA:
Stay tuned!

08:21.003 --> 08:22.008
It'sThe Amazing Race.

08:26.019 --> 08:28.017
KEOGHAN:
All teams are now flying

08:28.019 --> 08:31.001
from the United States
to England.

08:32.016 --> 08:34.014
When they land,
they must make their way here

08:34.016 --> 08:36.003
to Trafalgar Square

08:36.005 --> 08:39.016
and then look for London's
iconic red phone boxes,

08:39.018 --> 08:42.001
a symbol of the city
and a popular tourist attraction

08:42.003 --> 08:45.018
that's now come to life.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.003
Yes, you heard me right.

09:04.016 --> 09:06.005
Let's go!

09:06.007 --> 09:09.000
-Let's go, let's go.
There's taxis.
-There's taxis.

09:09.002 --> 09:10.028
-Oh!
-Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
-Let's get a cab.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.027
Hey, sir, we're going
to Trafalgar Square.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.014
-He looks fast, he looks fast.
-You got us, boss?

09:14.016 --> 09:16.022
-Right here.
-All right.

09:16.024 --> 09:18.007
-Trafalgar Square.
-Trafalgar Square, sir.

09:18.009 --> 09:20.015
-Yes, I like you.
-Yes.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.005
-Let's go! (whoops)
-Yeah, I like that.

09:23.007 --> 09:25.020
-There you go.
-Cut him off.
There you go, driver.

09:27.007 --> 09:30.029
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes, yes. Bye!

09:31.001 --> 09:32.029
-That was
the-the other girl team.
-Yeah.

09:33.001 --> 09:34.028
We got... we got competition
on our right here.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.015
-Hey!
-ISAIAH: Hey! What's up?

09:37.017 --> 09:40.019
-Stay back there.
-(laughter)

09:40.021 --> 09:43.016
Amazing Race 33!

09:43.018 --> 09:46.014
Season 33, here we come.
Team Detroit.

09:46.016 --> 09:49.021
(whooping)
Detroit.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.029
I am so excited
to do this with my dad because

09:53.001 --> 09:54.019
we're super fans of
The Amazing Race.

09:54.021 --> 09:55.025
We've been watching this
together

09:55.027 --> 09:58.000
-since I was eight years old.
-ARUN: This is what

09:58.002 --> 09:59.010
the American dream is.

09:59.012 --> 10:01.025
I was born in Bangalore, India.

10:01.027 --> 10:04.005
I came over to this country,
started working

10:04.007 --> 10:07.007
as a cashier in a fast food
restaurant, and now

10:07.009 --> 10:09.022
I am a partner
in one of the restaurants.

10:09.024 --> 10:12.027
Today, we happen
to do well in life.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.006
Natalia has done
some wonderful things.

10:15.008 --> 10:18.019
MVP of her track team,

10:18.021 --> 10:21.022
student of the year in
her college two years in a row,

10:21.024 --> 10:23.004
has a very good job.

10:23.006 --> 10:26.000
So I think it's the true
immigrant story,

10:26.002 --> 10:28.006
and it's a true American dream.

10:28.008 --> 10:30.005
-(car horn toots)
-SAM: We got backed up

10:30.007 --> 10:32.000
in a little bit
of a traffic jam.

10:32.002 --> 10:34.021
Our driver went
a completely different way,

10:34.023 --> 10:36.026
-so this way could be
the best route ever.
-Really...

10:36.028 --> 10:38.013
CONNIE:
We could be number one, or...

10:38.015 --> 10:40.005
SAM:
Or we could be in the back, so,

10:40.007 --> 10:43.011
I need you to pick up your pace
when you're running, so I can...

10:43.013 --> 10:44.027
-see you from the good side.
-I have small legs.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.027
Oh, there's our phone
right there.

10:56.029 --> 10:59.017
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

10:59.019 --> 11:01.003
-There he is. Stop. Stop. Stop.
-Sam, stop, stop, stop.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.015
Go.

11:04.017 --> 11:07.011
Hi. (whoops) First.

11:07.013 --> 11:09.009
-Hello. Hello.
-Hey, guy.
-Hi there.

11:09.011 --> 11:10.017
-How'd you do that?!
-How's it going?
-Welcome to London.

11:10.019 --> 11:12.017
-Thank you.
-Very good to have you here.

11:12.019 --> 11:15.009
-I believe I have something
for you, madam, there we are.
-Thank you.

11:15.011 --> 11:17.006
-I just have one more.
-That's... We were next.

11:17.008 --> 11:21.027
-We were next.
-Thank you so much.

11:21.029 --> 11:24.002
I think each man had,
like, two clues.

11:24.004 --> 11:25.022
'Cause we ran to this first guy,
and they were like, "Oh,

11:25.024 --> 11:27.028
I don't have any more clues."
So I was like, "Oh, damn."

11:28.000 --> 11:29.008
Maybe we should have took it.

11:29.010 --> 11:31.014
BOTH: "Travel on foot
to Buckingham Palace

11:31.016 --> 11:33.011
and find your clue
next to the Canada Gate."

11:33.013 --> 11:36.004
Teams will now race on foot

11:36.006 --> 11:39.007
to Buckingham Palace,
the centerpiece

11:39.009 --> 11:41.027
of this country's
constitutional monarchy.

11:41.029 --> 11:44.029
-Buckingham Palace.
-This way. This way.

11:45.001 --> 11:46.009
Right here.

11:46.011 --> 11:47.029
-Hi. Hello.
-Uh, do you have some for us?

11:48.001 --> 11:50.003
-A clue?
-We're looking for a clue.
-I do indeed have

11:50.005 --> 11:51.018
-a clue for you, there you are.
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

11:51.020 --> 11:53.008
We need Canada Gate.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.002
Turn left into there,
walk down... then right.

11:55.004 --> 11:56.029
-Let's go.
-All right, so...

11:57.001 --> 11:58.015
-And then what?
-And then we get
on that street right there?

11:58.017 --> 11:59.028
No, you just go
straight through.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.015
All right, cool.
Thank you so much, man. Yeah.

12:01.017 --> 12:02.020
Okay, thank you so much.
And have a blessed day.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.003
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

12:05.005 --> 12:07.003
All right, there's no one here.

12:07.005 --> 12:08.018
-Hi.
-Hello there.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.025
-Do you have something for us?
-I'm afraid I don't.

12:10.027 --> 12:13.000
-You don't?
-No, you'll have to look
elsewhere, I'm afraid.

12:13.002 --> 12:14.017
-Okay.
-Thank you for your call.

12:14.019 --> 12:17.013
-Thanks, boss.
All right, come on.
-Yeah.

12:17.015 --> 12:20.000
Oh, there's another guy.
Do you have something for us?

12:20.002 --> 12:22.000
-How are you?
-(speaks indistinctly)

12:22.002 --> 12:24.024
-Yes! Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:24.026 --> 12:27.015
-"Next to the Canada Gate."
-All right. Buckingham Palace.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.001
-Do you have a clue for us?
-Do you have a clue?

12:29.003 --> 12:32.011
-I may.
-(both cheering)

12:32.013 --> 12:34.018
"Find your clue
next to Canada Gate."

12:34.020 --> 12:37.005
-Sir. Hey. Oh, thank you, sir.
-(whooping)

12:37.007 --> 12:38.028
-Okay.
-Got one, baby.
-Thank you.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.003
-All right, ready?
-Let's do it.

12:40.005 --> 12:41.021
-There is your clue.
-Yes.

12:41.023 --> 12:42.026
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.025
Welcome to London.

12:43.027 --> 12:46.019
Yes!

12:46.021 --> 12:48.017
"Travel on foot to Buckingham
Palace and find your clue

12:48.019 --> 12:50.001
next to Canada Gate."

12:50.003 --> 12:52.016
All right. Come on, sexy.

12:52.018 --> 12:55.021
CONNIE:
I don't see anybody with bags.

12:55.023 --> 12:59.015
-Mm-hmm. Almost there.
Almost there.
-Oh, gosh. No.

12:59.017 --> 13:01.027
CONNIE:
It's so scary 'cause, I mean,
any leg, you could go home.

13:01.029 --> 13:03.021
Being away from the kids

13:03.023 --> 13:06.022
is the hardest part
of this wholeAmazing Race.

13:06.024 --> 13:09.010
SAM:
We're doing this for our family.
You know,

13:09.012 --> 13:10.017
I'm a high school teacher,
and she's...

13:10.019 --> 13:12.012
-working in retail.
-I work retail.

13:12.014 --> 13:14.007
SAM:
And, uh, we live paycheck
to paycheck.

13:14.009 --> 13:16.001
We'll never have
this opportunity again.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.007
CONNIE:
Sam and I have been
married for eight years.

13:18.009 --> 13:20.000
SAM:
I'm a high school
football coach.

13:20.002 --> 13:21.026
-ALL: Make him stand up!
-One more time!

13:21.028 --> 13:24.023
-Make him stand up!
-Don't bail on family.

13:24.025 --> 13:26.021
Our family consists of

13:26.023 --> 13:29.027
our two little girls
Charli and Journi.

13:29.029 --> 13:31.001
And we have a bonus son.

13:31.003 --> 13:33.017
Kind of a unique situation.

13:33.019 --> 13:36.013
I met Braheam Murphy
at Harding High School.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.025
He was in a tough situation,
living couch to couch,

13:38.027 --> 13:41.000
and I went home
and said, "Hey, baby,

13:41.002 --> 13:42.018
can we make dinner
for this kid?"

13:42.020 --> 13:44.006
And, uh, she's like,
"Yeah, bring him home."

13:44.008 --> 13:47.016
And he never left,
and greatness came from him.

13:47.018 --> 13:50.003
We were even able to win a state
championship, and he went

13:50.005 --> 13:51.011
and earned an opportunity
to go to West Point

13:51.013 --> 13:52.028
where he's at today.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.004
-I love him
like he's my biological son.
-Yeah.

13:55.006 --> 13:56.022
-He'll be with us forever, so...
-If someone asks me,
someone say,

13:56.024 --> 13:59.002
"How many kids you got?"
I got three kids, you know.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.013
-Let's get something
to eat, man.
-All right.

14:01.015 --> 14:04.004
SAM:
Oh, boy.

14:04.006 --> 14:06.018
-Come on, light.
-Shoot.

14:10.009 --> 14:12.019
-Oh, my God, here we go.
-Is that it?

14:12.021 --> 14:14.015
Get the letter!
Yes, it's the letter!

14:15.029 --> 14:19.003
Okay. Okay.

14:19.005 --> 14:20.011
"Detour."

14:20.013 --> 14:23.001
"Artist Den or Digi Ben?"

14:23.003 --> 14:27.013
KEOGHAN:
Surprisingly, street art
dates back to Roman times

14:27.015 --> 14:31.005
and has been thriving here
in London since the 1990s.

14:31.007 --> 14:32.026
Today, the world's
most popular artist

14:32.028 --> 14:36.024
is simply known
as Banksy, famous

14:36.026 --> 14:39.021
for his impactful
social commentary.

14:39.023 --> 14:42.009
This detour gives teams a chance
to make

14:42.011 --> 14:45.004
their own public statement
by posting a piece

14:45.006 --> 14:46.026
of original artwork.

14:46.028 --> 14:48.022
Once their artwork is
on full display,

14:48.024 --> 14:53.006
they'll get a clue.

14:53.008 --> 14:56.011
This detour requires teams
to time-travel through London.

14:56.013 --> 14:59.021
Their journey will begin here
in Parliament Square,

14:59.023 --> 15:03.010
where they'll need to find
the bobby near Big Ben,

15:03.012 --> 15:07.024
then find Little Ben and finally
connect with Digi Ben.

15:07.026 --> 15:09.020
-Digi Ben. Okay.
-We're gonna do Digi Ben.

15:09.022 --> 15:11.013
-RAQUEL: So we have to go to...
-CAYLA: Okay. "Travel on foot

15:11.015 --> 15:12.027
and find the bobby
in Parliament Square."

15:12.029 --> 15:15.002
Near Big Ben. Run? Okay.

15:15.004 --> 15:17.005
Oh.

15:17.007 --> 15:19.009
-Oh, there's a new clue, there.
-Go, go, Ryan. Go, go, go.

15:19.011 --> 15:21.018
-Oh.
-KIM: Can I see?
-You see him? Yup.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.007
We're going to Digi Ben.

15:24.009 --> 15:27.027
-We're about
to do an arts detour.
-Art detour.

15:27.029 --> 15:29.013
We're doing Digi Ben.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.002
-We're gonna do the artist den.
-Yeah.

15:32.004 --> 15:33.028
Got to find...
Ooh, phone booth right there.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.015
-Okay.
-Bowler hat. Let's go.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.005
Buckingham Palace Road.

15:38.007 --> 15:42.016
-Maybe it is down there.
-Maybe it is. (groans)

15:42.018 --> 15:45.013
-Do you have a clue for us?
-I'm afraid not. Sorry.

15:45.015 --> 15:47.014
-Do not have a clue for us.
-There's multiple down here.

15:47.016 --> 15:49.003
Oh, there's a bunch of 'em.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.013
I think
Buckingham Palace is that way.

15:51.015 --> 15:53.011
Okay. I don't know, though.

15:55.018 --> 15:58.013
-Sir, do you have a clue for us?
-I'm afraid not.

15:58.015 --> 16:00.024
Unbelievable.
All right, come on, babe.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.003
Go over here. Let's go.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.027
How are there no signs
for Buckingham Palace?

16:06.003 --> 16:08.024
-This is the square.
-Baby, this whole...

16:08.026 --> 16:10.011
It could be right here
on the edge.

16:10.013 --> 16:12.002
I don't think it would be.

16:14.003 --> 16:15.018
This is a sick joke.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.004
We'll go back here and just
look real thorough.

16:25.006 --> 16:28.012
-Here? Oh.
-Yeah.

16:28.014 --> 16:30.007
That's it.
Do you have a clue for us, sir?

16:30.009 --> 16:32.001
-Yes, I do.
-Oh, my gosh!
-All right!

16:32.003 --> 16:33.012
-Yes.
-Praise the Lord.

16:33.014 --> 16:35.007
-Thank you so much.
-Okay.

16:35.009 --> 16:37.022
-We got to go by foot
to Buckingham Palace.
-Canada Gate.

16:37.024 --> 16:39.026
As soon as you get round there,
you'll see Buckingham Palace.

16:39.028 --> 16:41.020
-Okay. Let's go.
-It's about a 17-minute jog.

16:41.022 --> 16:43.001
Okay, on it.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.021
-Buckingham Palace?
-Just go down.

16:45.023 --> 16:47.000
-Down?
-You-you can't miss it.

16:47.002 --> 16:48.005
-Very simple to get to.
-Okay, okay.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.012
-Okay.
-You can do it.

16:51.014 --> 16:52.018
BOTH:
Yes!

16:52.020 --> 16:55.001
We are the twins,
and we work in radio.

16:55.003 --> 16:57.015
It's 103.5!
KTU, the Beat of New York.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.021
-The twins here-- Lulu.
-And Lala.

16:59.023 --> 17:01.002
LULU:
We are identical,
and the way

17:01.004 --> 17:03.013
people tell us apart is
that they don't.

17:03.015 --> 17:05.008
BOTH:
We live together,

17:05.010 --> 17:07.000
we work together.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.011
LALA:
We do have our similarities,

17:08.013 --> 17:10.011
but I'm really depending
on our differences

17:10.013 --> 17:12.007
to win the race.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.028
If we were to win,
we've already spoken that...

17:14.000 --> 17:15.013
First thing we're gonna do is...

17:15.015 --> 17:16.023
pay off our parents' mortgage

17:16.025 --> 17:18.014
so that they don't have
to worry about it.

17:18.016 --> 17:20.006
They could retire
and live life.

17:20.008 --> 17:22.007
They took care of us. Now it's
our turn to take care of them.

17:22.009 --> 17:24.027
What if one of those cute guys
starts sweet-talking you?

17:24.029 --> 17:26.002
Are you gonna get distracted?

17:26.004 --> 17:27.008
They can sweet-talk
all they want.

17:27.010 --> 17:28.022
I'm gonna use that
to my advantage,

17:28.024 --> 17:30.012
and I'm gonna be like, "Bye."

17:30.014 --> 17:32.003
-All right.
-Thank you for your help.

17:32.005 --> 17:35.009
And we're dumbasses
for not asking before.

17:35.011 --> 17:36.017
And I don't really feel like

17:36.019 --> 17:38.006
anyone else is doing Digi Den
right now

17:38.008 --> 17:40.007
except for this team behind us.

17:40.009 --> 17:42.023
Let's go.

17:42.025 --> 17:44.008
-You made it. You made it.
-Are you twisted?

17:44.010 --> 17:45.026
-I didn't think
it was this hard.
-Yeah.

17:45.028 --> 17:48.002
I think we're always open
to working with another team

17:48.004 --> 17:49.002
if we're in the same vicinity.

17:49.004 --> 17:50.007
"Find the bobby

17:50.009 --> 17:52.000
in Parliament Square
near Big Ben."

17:52.002 --> 17:54.020
Please be Big Ben. Please.

17:54.022 --> 17:55.024
-(clock chimes)
-CAYLA: That's got
to be Big Ben.

17:55.026 --> 17:56.029
It's a big-ass clock.

17:57.001 --> 17:59.012
-Bobby. Bobby.
-Look for the bobby.

17:59.014 --> 18:00.018
-For the bobby.
-"For the." It has to be a thing

18:00.020 --> 18:03.005
-because it's "the."
-A bobby pin? A bobby.

18:03.007 --> 18:04.027
-Hold on. Think.
-I don't know.

18:04.029 --> 18:06.014
Maybe there'll be a statue
in front that says, "Bobby."

18:08.019 --> 18:10.017
So we're going
to Buckingham Palace.

18:10.019 --> 18:13.020
Hopefully, we're going
in the right direction.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.018
Let's go.

18:16.020 --> 18:19.000
MICHAEL: Moe and I work for
the Buffalo Police Department.

18:19.002 --> 18:21.002
We've been partners
two and a half years.

18:21.004 --> 18:22.018
MICHAEL: We were patrolling,
and somebody

18:22.020 --> 18:25.020
happened to get a video
of us singing a song.

18:25.022 --> 18:30.003
(in harmony):
♪We're gonna win
The Amazing Race. ♪

18:30.005 --> 18:31.008
MICHAEL:
Since those videos,

18:31.010 --> 18:32.029
we just received
a lot of love.

18:33.001 --> 18:35.010
MOE:
I have four kids
and a beautiful wife.

18:35.012 --> 18:36.023
MICHAEL:
And I'm a new father right now,

18:36.025 --> 18:38.005
so to actually win the race

18:38.007 --> 18:40.006
and then win the prize--
you know, this would

18:40.008 --> 18:41.023
definitely be
a life-changing moment

18:41.025 --> 18:43.028
and allow you to be able
to take care of your family.

18:45.006 --> 18:47.009
-Let's do artist den.
-All right.

18:47.011 --> 18:50.015
Little Ben, Big Ben,
Digi Ben-- that's what we doing.

18:50.017 --> 18:51.029
-Artist den.
-Artist den.

18:52.001 --> 18:52.029
-We choose artist den.
-We choose artist den.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.009
Now, is this Parliament Square?

18:55.011 --> 18:56.022
It is a square, but...

18:56.024 --> 18:59.004
You might be right.

18:59.006 --> 19:00.004
No one really understood
what it was,

19:00.006 --> 19:01.016
and I go, "I think it's a cop."

19:01.018 --> 19:03.019
And I remembered, like,
the big tall hats.

19:03.021 --> 19:05.008
Oh, yup.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.013
You got a clue for us?

19:08.013 --> 19:11.001
-Are you... are you a bobby?
-Ah.

19:11.003 --> 19:12.000
I might well
have something for you.

19:12.002 --> 19:13.016
-Ah.
-Yes, sir.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.023
"Travel on foot
to the Little Ben

19:15.025 --> 19:19.028
near Victoria Station
and find the promoter."

19:20.000 --> 19:21.014
-Victoria Station
right here, clear as day.
-Yeah.

19:21.016 --> 19:23.020
So we got to go back down
to Buckingham Palace, basically.

19:23.022 --> 19:25.029
All right, come on.
Let's go, boys.

19:26.001 --> 19:27.027
-Oh, yeah, another 12 miles.
-(laughs)

19:30.006 --> 19:32.017
-Yeah, we're gonna do
artist den. Okay.
-Artist den, okay.

19:32.019 --> 19:35.022
-So we're gonna do the, uh,
Digi Ben. Digi Ben.
-Digi Ben.

19:35.024 --> 19:37.026
Come on, dude, in the race.
Why they running that way?

19:37.028 --> 19:40.002
We can't keep walking.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.012
So we're both Division One
basketball players.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.022
Like, she's a super athlete.

19:43.024 --> 19:45.027
Pain is weakness
leaving your body.

19:45.029 --> 19:47.019
Just keep going!

19:47.021 --> 19:49.015
It's 22 years later,
two children later,

19:49.017 --> 19:51.024
-and when it comes to...
-AKBAR: That are watching.

19:51.026 --> 19:54.016
...working out,
that took a backseat.

19:54.018 --> 19:58.022
-Slow and steady.
-No, that's not. No, no.

19:58.024 --> 20:00.016
That's losing steady.

20:02.012 --> 20:05.000
-Art den?
-The artist den.

20:06.008 --> 20:08.003
RAQUEL:
We need to find the bobby.

20:08.005 --> 20:09.020
-What's the bobby?
-What is that?

20:09.022 --> 20:11.018
A policeman. I...

20:13.003 --> 20:14.022
Oh.

20:14.024 --> 20:16.002
-Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.
-RAQUEL: All right.

20:16.004 --> 20:17.011
-Okay.
-Okay. A policeman. A policeman.

20:17.013 --> 20:19.001
I was gonna kiss that woman.

20:19.003 --> 20:20.026
We're looking for a cop.

20:20.028 --> 20:22.025
(bicycle bell dings)

20:22.027 --> 20:25.026
I see a cop. I see a cop.
Oh, is that another team?

20:25.028 --> 20:27.018
No. Maybe not. I don't know.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.028
AKBAR:
Come on. Sheri, come on.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.006
SHERI:
There's cars.

20:31.008 --> 20:32.023
(exclaims indistinctly)

20:32.025 --> 20:34.012
Sir, do you have a clue for us?
You have a clue?

20:34.014 --> 20:35.019
-You're the bobby.
-Hi, sir.

20:35.021 --> 20:37.008
-I might have something for you.
-Oh, my God.

20:37.010 --> 20:38.026
AKBAR:
We're looking for the bobby.

20:40.009 --> 20:44.021
She just keeps stopping.
We can rest there.

20:44.023 --> 20:47.009
"Travel on foot to Little Ben
near Victoria Station."

20:47.011 --> 20:49.014
-Come on, Sheri.
-(horn blaring)

20:52.010 --> 20:53.013
-We're...
-Give me a kiss.

20:53.015 --> 20:54.027
Okay. Thank you.

20:54.029 --> 20:56.004
-Let's go.
-Wait, wait!

20:56.006 --> 20:57.026
See that communication?

20:57.028 --> 20:59.001
Yeah, that was
good communication, honey.

20:59.003 --> 21:00.011
Way to communicate.

21:00.013 --> 21:01.026
We've been married for 15 years,

21:01.028 --> 21:03.027
but in dog years,
it's like a thousand because

21:03.029 --> 21:06.001
we work together
and we raise kids together.

21:06.003 --> 21:09.017
We make weird family videos
for a living.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.023
KIM:
We have a video background,

21:10.025 --> 21:12.017
and I decided
that we should make

21:12.019 --> 21:15.003
a Christmas video
to send our friends and family.

21:15.005 --> 21:17.007
We called it
"Christmas Jammies,"

21:17.009 --> 21:19.008
and it got many millions
of views

21:19.010 --> 21:20.020
in a very short amount
of time.

21:20.022 --> 21:23.003
We realized we could
actually make it a living,

21:23.005 --> 21:25.025
continuing to make goofy,
funny

21:25.027 --> 21:28.014
musical dance videos
with our family.

21:28.016 --> 21:30.019
Being able to do something
that we love--

21:30.021 --> 21:31.023
there's no substitute for that.

21:31.025 --> 21:33.010
Not even a million dollars.

21:33.012 --> 21:35.009
BOTH:
But maybe a million dollars.

21:35.011 --> 21:36.027
Looking for the mess hall.

21:36.029 --> 21:39.024
-How do we get there?
-Okay, thank you.

21:39.026 --> 21:40.021
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.015
-KIM: Hey, we see another team.
-Over here.

21:43.017 --> 21:44.026
KIM:
Can we go with you?

21:44.028 --> 21:46.018
RAY:
Yeah, here, through this.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.004
-Here.
-RAY: They said
enter through the back way.

21:49.006 --> 21:50.016
-Over here, over here!
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.021
Yeah, right here.

21:51.023 --> 21:54.020
-Dude.
-Hello. Hi!

21:54.022 --> 21:56.026
-Give me a high five.
-Hi. (whoops)

21:56.028 --> 21:58.018
PENN:
No way we were gonna find...

21:58.020 --> 22:00.025
-Thank you, thank you. Yeah.
-Of course.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.012
-Thank you so much, seriously.
-Thank you, guys.

22:07.005 --> 22:10.015
All you got to do--
dip the paste, okay?

22:10.017 --> 22:12.023
Slap it on, make sure
it's all lined up, okay?

22:12.025 --> 22:16.025
-Okay.
-Perfectly,
and basically that's it.

22:16.027 --> 22:19.004
-Make it nice and straight.
-Okay.

22:19.006 --> 22:21.006
Cool, chill. I'm out of here.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.025
-Okay. Paste it big.
-All of those go up, okay.

22:23.027 --> 22:26.017
-Slap it on.
-Oh, does it make something?

22:26.019 --> 22:28.005
-Yeah.
-It makes... Oh, I see.

22:28.007 --> 22:29.015
-Yup.
-Okay, take it down.

22:29.017 --> 22:31.007
-I said "Wait a second."
-Yeah.

22:31.009 --> 22:32.024
"The Amazing Race doesn't do

22:32.026 --> 22:33.019
just stick stuff up
on the wall."

22:33.021 --> 22:35.002
This is a puzzle.

22:35.004 --> 22:38.002
Oh, oh. Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

22:38.004 --> 22:39.027
We are completing a puzzle.

22:39.029 --> 22:42.002
We're just trying
to organize those pieces.

22:42.004 --> 22:44.000
We're looking for Little Ben.

22:44.002 --> 22:47.009
Hey, see that clock tower?
Could that be it?

22:47.011 --> 22:49.010
I think it's wrong.
Like, I think it's further down.

22:49.012 --> 22:51.011
Oh, my God.

22:51.013 --> 22:53.015
"Find the bobby
in Parliament Square."

22:53.017 --> 22:55.001
-SHERI: Is he a bobby?
-Who?

22:55.003 --> 22:57.001
The man walking right there.

22:57.003 --> 22:59.025
AKBAR:
Oh, my God. If not,
we got to ask him.

22:59.027 --> 23:03.017
Excuse me, sir?
Do you have a clue for us?

23:03.019 --> 23:06.005
-Depends who you're looking for.
-I'm looking for the bobby.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.007
-Well, in that case,
I may be able to help you.
-Ah.

23:08.009 --> 23:10.027
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir.

23:10.029 --> 23:14.002
-"Travel..."
-"Travel on foot to Little Ben
near Victoria Station."

23:14.004 --> 23:15.015
Come on, Sheri.
We got to make up time.

23:15.017 --> 23:17.010
Little Ben? Little Ben?

23:17.012 --> 23:20.000
Hey, what is that?
What is that clock right there?

23:20.002 --> 23:21.021
-Little Ben.
-Little Ben.
Little Ben. Little Ben.

23:21.023 --> 23:24.014
-RYAN: Nice, you guys got it.
-SPENCER: Promoter!

23:24.016 --> 23:26.016
Hello.
Do you have a clue for us?

23:26.018 --> 23:28.024
Cheerio. Thank you.

23:28.026 --> 23:30.019
"Travel on foot
or by taxi to the..."

23:30.021 --> 23:33.000
RYAN: "...Piccadilly tube
station to find Digi Ben."

23:34.006 --> 23:35.027
-What do you want to do?
Oh, taxi?
-Taxi.

23:35.029 --> 23:37.027
-See you guys there. Good luck.
-All right, boss. Later, man.

23:37.029 --> 23:39.018
Piccadilly tube station?

23:39.020 --> 23:42.018
-Do you know
where Piccadilly Station is?
-MAN: Yeah.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.029
Dusty and Ryan have been a good,

23:44.001 --> 23:46.001
uh, you know, duo to stick with
for a little bit.

23:46.003 --> 23:48.011
We decided
that it's a little too far

23:48.013 --> 23:49.025
for us to get there by foot

23:49.027 --> 23:51.014
so we're gonna spend
a little money, take a cab,

23:51.016 --> 23:53.014
get there and find Digi Den.

23:53.016 --> 23:54.026
Okay, this way.

23:54.028 --> 23:55.025
-Come in, please.
-Okay.
-Thank you.

23:55.027 --> 23:58.007
-And gather here.
-NATALIA: Okay.

23:58.009 --> 23:59.017
I guess we just have to put it
in a puzzle together

23:59.019 --> 24:01.014
-and then put it up. Okay.
-Yeah.

24:01.016 --> 24:03.002
We are ready. We are ready.

24:03.004 --> 24:04.011
-Where-where do we need to go?
-Let's flip them all over.

24:04.013 --> 24:06.005
Yes, this makes, uh...
this makes something.

24:06.007 --> 24:07.024
Oh, it might be its own clue.

24:07.026 --> 24:10.005
KIM:
It's the worst
possible puzzle ever

24:10.007 --> 24:11.024
-'cause there's no clear...
-It's definite...

24:11.026 --> 24:13.011
There's nothing to look at.

24:13.013 --> 24:15.020
This is together. I got it.

24:15.022 --> 24:19.004
You are so hot right now.

24:19.006 --> 24:21.014
You're likeA Beautiful Mind
right now with this.

24:21.016 --> 24:24.000
I'm John Nash-ing my ass off.

24:24.002 --> 24:25.024
I have really bad ADHD,

24:25.026 --> 24:28.009
but there's this thing
called "hyperfocus" where,

24:28.011 --> 24:31.000
when there's a task
right in front of you, you can

24:31.002 --> 24:34.017
really commit, like, every
single bit of your brain to it.

24:34.019 --> 24:36.012
It's kind of a cool superpower
that comes out of a disorder.

24:36.014 --> 24:37.025
We're there. We're there.

24:38.025 --> 24:40.012
Ow.

24:40.014 --> 24:41.027
-Just hand it to me
one at a time.
-Yeah.

24:41.029 --> 24:44.011
-So, remember,
paint the thing first.
-Yeah. Oh, I did.

24:44.013 --> 24:46.006
Lather, slap.

24:46.008 --> 24:49.001
Lather.

24:49.003 --> 24:50.017
-You're really good at this.
-Yeah...

24:50.019 --> 24:52.017
-So I'm gonna just
organize these for you.
-Yeah.

24:52.019 --> 24:53.027
And I will, once everything's
organized,

24:53.029 --> 24:55.016
I will start helping.

24:55.018 --> 24:58.021
We've been together now
for, like, seven months, and

24:58.023 --> 25:00.008
we met on the dating show
Love Island.

25:00.010 --> 25:02.002
It was in Fiji,
and you're thrown

25:02.004 --> 25:04.008
into a villa with singles,

25:04.010 --> 25:06.012
-and I found my match.

-You see a little clock?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.021
There's a little clock
right there.

25:29.023 --> 25:31.006

-Maybe. Maybe.
That's Little Ben.

25:55.027 --> 25:58.004
-Bobby?!
-There's no person named Bobby.

25:58.006 --> 26:00.005

Uh...
-The bobby.

26:00.007 --> 26:02.007
-It's not a person.

for, you're letting them down.

-We're looking for Little Ben.

26:40.013 --> 26:42.004
Sheri, you got to give me more.

-Ak, shut up!
-I'm not shutting up.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.024

-That's what you did?

26:56.001 --> 26:57.006
I should be more sensitive,

26:57.008 --> 26:59.019
but in the moment,
I just was like,

26:59.021 --> 27:01.024
"I know you got another gear."
I didn't see that second wind.

27:01.026 --> 27:03.016

27:03.018 --> 27:05.010
Lala, we're looking
for the artist den.

27:05.012 --> 27:07.000
I'm looking for street signs.

I don't understand how...
I don't get it.

27:08.018 --> 27:12.018

-Uh-huh.

27:12.020 --> 27:14.021

So we got to put these up here.

27:20.027 --> 27:23.005
Is there any rhyme or reason,
though, bro?

27:23.007 --> 27:26.020
Just put 'em on the thing.
This is graffiti.

27:26.022 --> 27:28.019
But this is art, so you...
I can't be putting it up...

27:28.021 --> 27:31.022
But it's-it's no different,
though.

27:31.024 --> 27:35.006
We are both terrible at puzzles,
and this seems like a puzzle,

27:35.008 --> 27:37.001
so we might have picked
the wrong challenge, but...

27:37.003 --> 27:38.014
Okay, no.

27:38.016 --> 27:40.010
Babe, can you help me?

27:40.012 --> 27:41.025
So we have taken these
off the wall because

27:41.027 --> 27:43.024
they're not aligned perfectly,
and we want to make sure

27:43.026 --> 27:45.006

to just keep doing that, honey?

Let's get out of here.

34:04.006 --> 34:07.004
I hate art.

34:07.006 --> 34:08.018
You need to relax
and not stress out.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.008
I think we're in last place

34:10.010 --> 34:12.029
because you just never know
with this... with this race.

34:13.001 --> 34:16.021
I never want
to see an art piece ever again.

34:16.023 --> 34:19.002
-Hi! Hi! Do you have a clue?
-Hi.

34:19.004 --> 34:20.023
-Can I give you a hug?
-Oh, yes. Okay, wonderful.

34:20.025 --> 34:23.001
Hi. Can I give you a hug? Hi.

We're going to the Natural
History Museum to see Phil!

34:40.027 --> 34:43.012
-Yes.
-Oh, God.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.022
Thank you so much.

34:44.024 --> 34:46.019
Okay.

34:48.021 --> 34:52.007
It's just frustrating, um,

34:52.009 --> 34:54.002
'cause you got to be
pretty precise with all this.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.017
Check.

-Those are the boys. Oh, my God.

35:55.021 --> 35:56.023

from Florida.

-Oh, no, no!

36:06.006 --> 36:06.028
Don't let them get ahead of us.

36:13.012 --> 36:15.028
Yeah, toast. Toast!

No, no, don't let them pass.
Don't let them pass.

Yeah, don't let them pass,
please.

get 'em, get 'em! (laughs)
-Yeah.

36:23.027 --> 36:25.022
Oh, crap. They're getting ahead.

36:25.024 --> 36:28.028
Okay.

-Let's go.
-Here we go. Boom.

36:37.022 --> 36:39.001
Anthony and Spencer,
I am pleased

36:39.003 --> 36:41.008
to tell you
that you are team number one.

36:41.010 --> 36:45.004
-(whoops)
-(screaming)

36:45.006 --> 36:46.024
-Let's go!
-Let's do it!

36:46.026 --> 36:49.008
I have a great prize for you.
You have won a trip for two

36:49.010 --> 36:53.009
from Travelocity, and you are
going to Turks and Caicos.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.011
-Oh! Wow.
-Let's go!

36:55.013 --> 36:57.021
KEOGHAN: You're gonna stay five
nights at the Sailrock Resort

36:57.023 --> 37:00.022
in an ocean view suite
where you'll set sail

37:00.024 --> 37:02.026
for a picnic lunch
and snorkeling adventure

37:02.028 --> 37:05.011
among the vibrant coral reefs.

37:05.013 --> 37:07.022
And later,
you get to enjoy massages

37:07.024 --> 37:09.024
at the spa cabana
overlooking the water.

37:09.026 --> 37:12.004
-Hey, not bad, not bad.
-How good does that sound?

37:12.006 --> 37:14.021
-That sounds amazing.
-That sounds...
that sounds great.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.001
SPENCER:
Just who me and Anthony
have been our entire lives--

37:17.003 --> 37:18.020
we've always wanted
to be the best

37:18.022 --> 37:19.026
at really anything
we've attempted.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.008
We've had some
great experiences,

37:21.010 --> 37:22.020
but a million dollars
would change our lives.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.013
SPENCER:
People think, because

37:23.015 --> 37:24.027
we did a movie, that we're rich.

37:24.029 --> 37:27.003
We ain't rich.
We're broke heroes.

37:27.005 --> 37:28.026
That should be
our little hashtag.

37:28.028 --> 37:31.001
And look at that. Another team
running in right now.

37:31.003 --> 37:34.006
(whooping)

37:34.008 --> 37:35.028
-Boom.
-Ah!

37:36.000 --> 37:37.025
(whoops)

37:37.027 --> 37:41.006
-Good job, guys.
-Oh, God.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.028
Congratulations. You're the
first three teams to arrive.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Now you've had a little taste of
whatThe Amazing Race is like.

37:47.002 --> 37:48.017
How does it feel?

37:48.019 --> 37:49.023
-Feels amazing.
-It gives us an idea...

37:49.025 --> 37:51.004
I want more.

37:51.006 --> 37:53.012
Feels like freedom.

37:53.014 --> 37:55.003
I lost ten years
of my life, and

37:55.005 --> 37:57.001
having the opportunity
with my best friend

37:57.003 --> 37:58.022
to go around the world,
the complete opposite

37:58.024 --> 38:01.004
of sitting
in a tiny little cage--

38:01.006 --> 38:03.018
nothing seems more amazing.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.011
Yes, baby, yes.

38:05.013 --> 38:07.024
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

38:07.026 --> 38:10.012
-It's such a dream. Oh, my gosh.
-You're so beautiful.

38:10.014 --> 38:12.014
-Ah, we're ver...
-Ver-Very sweaty

38:12.016 --> 38:16.019
-and very happy to meet you.
-Yes.

38:16.021 --> 38:18.004
Do you have any advice
on how to live your life?

38:18.006 --> 38:19.024
-Anything you can tell us to...?
-Okay, should we...?

38:21.001 --> 38:22.018
Just keep happy.

38:22.020 --> 38:25.009
(gasps)
We're going on Pit Stop.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.023
-Thank you.
-(laughs softly)

38:26.025 --> 38:28.014
Mwah.

38:28.016 --> 38:30.007
Always wanted to kiss the queen.

38:30.009 --> 38:34.004
Boris Johnson, what's going on,
my guy? You got a helmet on?

38:34.006 --> 38:35.025
Yeah, can we have a clue?

38:35.027 --> 38:37.027
"Warning. The last team
to check in will be eliminated."

38:37.029 --> 38:40.015
-It'll be okay. Okay.
-Oh. Okay.

38:40.017 --> 38:43.028
"Warning. The last team
to check in will be eliminated."

38:44.000 --> 38:45.022
"Enter
The Natural History Museum

38:45.024 --> 38:46.018
through the main entrance."
Okay.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.028
-So we need to go by taxi.
-Taxi.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.017
Dad, what are you doing?
It was fine.

38:49.019 --> 38:51.017
Sorry. I just wanted
to make sure...

38:51.019 --> 38:54.005
-Now there's, like, a gap.
-No, that was a gap
that was there.

38:54.007 --> 38:56.005
That's-that's what
I was trying to fix.

38:56.007 --> 38:58.006
It's all tore up right now.

38:58.008 --> 39:01.004
Once you, like,
paint the paper, and you try

39:01.006 --> 39:02.028
to take 'em back down
when they're soaking wet,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.020
they start to rip and they
start to get the holes in 'em.

39:05.022 --> 39:07.021
-And it's like, it becomes
even more confusing.
-MOE: Mm-hmm.

39:07.023 --> 39:09.008
MICHAEL:
But we're gonna keep pushing

39:09.010 --> 39:11.008
until the wheels
fall completely off.

39:11.010 --> 39:12.016
MOE:
We're doing this for more
than just ourselves.

39:12.018 --> 39:15.025
Like, we represent Buffalo.
Like, we love our city.

39:15.027 --> 39:17.008
And we're not losers.

39:17.010 --> 39:19.003
There, see how
that blue lines up?

39:19.005 --> 39:21.013
I think that maybe
we should put some of it up,

39:21.015 --> 39:22.025
and then from here,
we could look at it?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.028
-But we don't know.
-But, Lala,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.020
it's gonna take us forever
to post this up here.

39:27.022 --> 39:28.029
Then start doing it.

39:29.001 --> 39:30.005
Now is not the time
to be arguing.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.019
I'm not.
I'm asking a serious question.

39:31.021 --> 39:33.007
-Then ask.
-Do you...? Which...?

39:33.009 --> 39:34.024
Is this the bottom or the top?

39:34.026 --> 39:35.029
When we put it up,
we're gonna see what's wrong,

39:36.001 --> 39:37.017
and we're gonna be able
to move it some.

39:37.019 --> 39:39.024
So, then why didn't you do it
the first time when I said

39:39.026 --> 39:42.002
-to put it up?
-Yeah, but you-you were
saying it like...

39:42.004 --> 39:44.011
I said it the same way

39:44.013 --> 39:45.016
-all three times.
-Bitchy. Yes, you're right.

39:45.018 --> 39:46.019
-Bitchy.
-All three times.

39:46.021 --> 39:48.007
You know,
we're on the same team,

39:48.009 --> 39:50.009
-in case you... in case you...
-I know that.

39:50.011 --> 39:52.011
Wanted to make sure you knew.

39:53.018 --> 39:56.009
Yeah, that looks beautiful
to me. That looks great.

39:56.011 --> 39:58.012
Can we get a check?

39:59.011 --> 40:03.018
-Yes! Yes!
-(whoops)

40:03.020 --> 40:05.009
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's get our stuff together.

40:06.009 --> 40:07.023
Oh.

40:07.025 --> 40:09.018
I just feel like
we're never gonna finish.

40:10.024 --> 40:12.022
(Penn whooping)

40:12.024 --> 40:14.012
-Hey, Phil.
-On the red line.

40:14.014 --> 40:15.022
Boom.

40:15.024 --> 40:17.022
Our kids pushed us
out the door...

40:17.024 --> 40:21.002
and said,
"Don't get eliminated first."

40:21.004 --> 40:22.005
(laughs)

40:22.007 --> 40:24.005
Please kick some ass,
because we just can't have

40:24.007 --> 40:26.010
all young people,
you know, winning all the time.

40:26.012 --> 40:28.001
-That's what
we're gonna represent.
-You know what I'm saying?

40:28.003 --> 40:29.008
-Represent. Yeah.
-Represent. Represent.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.025
NATALIA:
Well, hopefully...

40:30.027 --> 40:33.021
We're praying that we're
doing it the right direction.

40:33.023 --> 40:35.003
-Can we check?
-ARUN: Check.

40:41.028 --> 40:43.027
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
That's looking great.

40:43.029 --> 40:45.017
(Arun and Natalia cheer)

40:45.019 --> 40:46.023
-You've done well.
-BOTH: Thank you.

40:46.025 --> 40:47.023
-Thank you.
-Okay.

40:47.025 --> 40:49.001
Oh, my God.

40:49.003 --> 40:50.010
Let's take a taxi.

40:51.009 --> 40:53.008
Not all right.

40:53.010 --> 40:54.026
CARO:
This is just unreal!

40:54.028 --> 40:56.002
Caro and Ray.

40:56.004 --> 40:57.009
There we are.

40:57.011 --> 40:59.013
Got another team coming in.

40:59.015 --> 41:01.007
Akbar and Sheri,
nice to see you.

41:01.009 --> 41:04.001
Come on, baby, let's go.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.022
You guys are breathing
like it's the last leg

41:05.024 --> 41:07.023
and your life
depends on it right now.

41:07.025 --> 41:09.008
You know, you don't want
to live with no regrets, man.

41:09.010 --> 41:12.002
A lot of kids watching and, uh,
you want to be that example.

41:12.004 --> 41:14.004
We was at each other's necks
a little bit.

41:14.006 --> 41:16.005
I was trying to dig deep and
find that old athlete in her.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.000
Hopefully it'll be out next leg,

41:18.002 --> 41:19.019
-but, yeah, it wasn't this leg.
-It was out this leg.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.026
-(laughs): It wasn't this leg.
-It was out this leg.

41:23.004 --> 41:24.020
Come on, we got
to beat this team.

41:24.022 --> 41:26.024
There's still
one team left here,

41:26.026 --> 41:28.002
so as long, as long as
we beat...

41:28.004 --> 41:29.013
beat that other team here.

41:29.015 --> 41:30.015
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

41:30.017 --> 41:32.003
LALA:
Could this go here?

41:32.005 --> 41:33.009
LULU:
Like that?

41:38.002 --> 41:41.000
-Guys, it's wrong.
-LULU: It's wrong?

41:41.002 --> 41:42.013
Can we get a hint? (chuckles)

41:42.015 --> 41:44.011
Don't get frustrated.
Just keep moving.

41:44.013 --> 41:45.011
MOE:
I think that's it, bro.

41:45.013 --> 41:46.015
MICHAEL:
Check.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.000
You've got to fix...

41:51.021 --> 41:54.011
MOE:
All right. Thank you.

41:54.013 --> 41:55.008
-Thank you, thank you.
-Bring you some new bits,

41:55.010 --> 41:56.029
'cause it's, uh, a bit torn.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.025
-And we understand that. So...
-Thank you. Yes, sir.

41:58.027 --> 42:00.014
(Michael groans)

42:00.016 --> 42:03.006
Once I seen that we were the
only two teams that were there,

42:03.008 --> 42:04.015
it really
started making me worry.

42:04.017 --> 42:05.021
Now the sense of urgency.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.020
Now we're really
going to rush mode.

42:07.022 --> 42:09.006
Like, your brain
wants to shut down,

42:09.008 --> 42:10.010
but you got to keep pushing.

42:10.012 --> 42:13.006
Oh, my God, man.

42:13.008 --> 42:14.025
MOE:
What in the world?

42:14.027 --> 42:16.016
This, this ain't easy.

42:21.013 --> 42:22.015
LALA:
What do you think?

42:22.017 --> 42:23.020
What do you think?
What do you think?

42:23.022 --> 42:24.014
What do you think? What do
you think?

42:24.016 --> 42:27.015
Like that?

42:27.017 --> 42:29.001
-Check.
-Check.

42:34.013 --> 42:35.029
I heard him say, "That's wrong,"
to the other team over there,

42:36.001 --> 42:38.021
so that means
we still got a-a chance.

42:38.023 --> 42:40.005

Come on.

you are team number seven.

-Yes. (laughs)

42:51.002 --> 42:52.026
You look like
you just wonThe Amazing Race.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.020
-You're so relieved right now.
-(laughter)

42:56.029 --> 42:59.012
Taylor and Isaiah,
you are team number eight.

Awesome, man. That's good.

All right, I'm just
sliding all the new paper

43:09.015 --> 43:11.003
over the old ones,
bro, but it's working.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.021
-See that?
-MICHAEL: Check.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.004
I hope they get it wrong.

43:16.025 --> 43:17.023

-All right.

43:26.001 --> 43:28.006

exactly what I didn't want.

43:28.008 --> 43:29.004
I found a better match.

43:29.006 --> 43:30.028
So now that matches.

43:31.000 --> 43:31.029
Check.

43:32.001 --> 43:33.029
Okay, sisters, you've done it.

a little taste of the race.

43:47.029 --> 43:49.007
What do you know now
that you didn't know

43:49.009 --> 43:51.002
when you started this race?

43:51.004 --> 43:52.009
We know that six or seven teams,

43:52.011 --> 43:55.001
physically,
are extremely strong.

43:55.003 --> 43:57.022
Just because somebody might be
faster and stronger than you,

43:57.024 --> 43:59.004
at the end of the day...
(clicks tongue)

43:59.006 --> 44:01.004

The street,
the street we just passed?

44:10.004 --> 44:11.024

We should've told that cab
to wait.

What's the address? 58?

44:36.017 --> 44:37.029
58 Greek Street.

MICHAEL:
Look, bro. Look, bro.

44:40.012 --> 44:41.021
LALA:
We need a cab.

44:41.023 --> 44:43.010
Can you take us to
the Natural Museum of History?

44:43.012 --> 44:44.026
-Fast.
-Really fast?

44:44.028 --> 44:46.018
MICHAEL:
They might've found that clue
already, bro.

44:46.020 --> 44:48.000
Oh, my gosh.

44:48.002 --> 44:49.004
Right here, bro.

We saw Mike and Moe.

I don't think that they

found the place.

So we are neck and neck.

44:55.003 --> 44:57.003
The last team to check in

44:57.005 --> 44:59.013

I'm not gonna believe that
we're the last team right now.

It ain't over till it's over.

Oh, my God.

45:08.019 --> 45:09.017

Once we out the car,

45:10.026 --> 45:12.000
we run into the museum.

If we see another team,

50:20.028 --> 50:22.005
CARO:
(sighs) Finally.

50:22.007 --> 50:23.005
Thank you.

50:23.007 --> 50:24.013
RAY:
We're going to, uh...

50:24.015 --> 50:25.022
BOTH:
...the Postal Museum.

50:29.019 --> 50:30.020
RYAN:
Is this it, sir?

50:31.007 --> 50:32.017
Let's go.

50:32.019 --> 50:34.020
(whoops) We're free.

50:34.022 --> 50:37.007
All your dreams come true
at the Mail Rail.

50:37.009 --> 50:38.007
RYAN:
Let's do it.

50:38.009 --> 50:40.021
Oh, this looks interesting.

50:40.023 --> 50:43.001
Well, well, well,
look at this little thing.

50:43.003 --> 50:45.008
It's a sweet cockpit.

50:45.010 --> 50:46.027
-Roadblock time.
-Oh...

50:46.029 --> 50:48.006
DUSTY:
Who still gets mail?

50:48.008 --> 50:50.007
KEOGHAN:
We all know what airmail is,

50:50.009 --> 50:52.021
but here in London
they used mail rail

50:52.023 --> 50:55.008
for more than 75 years--

50:55.010 --> 50:58.011
a six-and-a-half-mile-long
railway track

50:58.013 --> 51:01.012
used to deliver mail
under the city.

51:01.014 --> 51:02.027
At its peak,

51:02.029 --> 51:05.012
it delivered more than
four million letters every day.

51:05.014 --> 51:07.002
And now,

51:07.004 --> 51:10.020
this Roadblock requires teams
to ride this trusty rail

51:10.022 --> 51:11.024
to a loading dock...

51:13.004 --> 51:16.007
...and then sort through
thousands of envelopes

51:16.009 --> 51:18.022
until they find one
that is letter perfect.

51:18.024 --> 51:20.007
I'll be doing the Roadblock.

51:20.009 --> 51:22.020
Can I hop in?
Are we gonna go for a ride?

51:22.022 --> 51:24.000
(whoops)

51:24.002 --> 51:26.005
For a mil, I will, Ryan.
Let's get it!

51:26.007 --> 51:27.010
(laughs): Yeah.

51:27.012 --> 51:29.025
Confidence level in Ryan
is extremely high,

51:29.027 --> 51:31.022
especially for a challenge
where he has to rummage

51:31.024 --> 51:33.009
through things
and rip things open.

51:33.011 --> 51:34.025
He's a squirrely little dude.

51:34.027 --> 51:36.012
He's like
a raccoon in a dumpster.

51:36.014 --> 51:37.025
RYAN:
They used to transport
the mail like this.

51:37.027 --> 51:39.015
This is so cool.

51:39.017 --> 51:41.012
We are going, like,
down down, too.

51:42.021 --> 51:43.012
DUSTY:
Let's go, baby!

51:43.014 --> 51:45.013
(whoops)

51:45.015 --> 51:47.020
It's, uh, this is,
this is awesome.

51:47.022 --> 51:49.013
This is incredible.

51:49.015 --> 51:51.028
All right,
I got to find my marked bin.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.028
It's go time.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.004
We're gonna,
we're gonna look for a clue.

51:56.006 --> 51:58.006
But I have no idea
what I'm doing.

51:58.008 --> 51:59.029
You know, there's names
on these things, too.

52:00.001 --> 52:01.011
So I'll-I'll go back
and look at that later.

52:01.013 --> 52:03.001
'Cause who knows, I mean,

52:03.003 --> 52:04.008
it might have our name on it,
or something, and...

52:04.010 --> 52:07.015
so we could be here
for the next three hours.

52:09.022 --> 52:11.008
-Ready?
-Go.

52:11.010 --> 52:12.021
I think we learned a lot
from the last leg

52:12.023 --> 52:14.029
more than any other team,
just because of the adversity

52:15.001 --> 52:16.013
we had to go through.

52:16.015 --> 52:18.021
And I think it's gonna
prepare us for today.

52:18.023 --> 52:20.014
Where are we going today?

52:20.016 --> 52:22.010
TAYLOR: At times, we can be
very much so polar opposites.

52:22.012 --> 52:23.017
-Yes.
-He's a Gemini, I'm a Libra.

52:23.019 --> 52:24.021
ISAIAH:
I'm always right,

52:24.023 --> 52:25.021
he's always right,

52:25.023 --> 52:28.001
so that can create some tension.

52:28.003 --> 52:29.014
So I think
it's gonna be interesting.

52:29.016 --> 52:30.029
We've been getting along so far.

52:31.001 --> 52:32.024
-Oh, you can pull in there?
-Yeah.

52:32.026 --> 52:34.020
-Hey, let's go.
-Go.

52:34.022 --> 52:35.017
How you doing?
Thank you so much.

52:35.019 --> 52:36.025
SAM:
Taxi!

52:36.027 --> 52:38.009
-CONNIE: Oh, yes.
-Yes.

52:38.011 --> 52:41.024
(sighs)
Thank you, sir.

52:41.026 --> 52:44.000
NATALIA:
Be on the lookout for a taxi.

52:44.002 --> 52:46.004
We bicker from time to time.

52:46.006 --> 52:48.010
It's not like
a traditional Indian family

52:48.012 --> 52:49.011
where the dad is all,

52:49.013 --> 52:51.005
"What I say
is the rule of the law."

52:51.007 --> 52:52.023
NATALIA:
Yeah. He's probably the farthest

52:52.025 --> 52:54.020
from, like,
a traditional Indian father.

52:56.027 --> 52:57.023
Sometimes, we disagree.

52:57.025 --> 52:59.016
Uh, I think it's a good thing,

52:59.018 --> 53:01.018
because I think then
we respect each other.

53:01.020 --> 53:03.003
NATALIA:
Close it.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.025
Okay, here we go.

53:08.027 --> 53:10.021
People think that
I'm the stronger one

53:10.023 --> 53:11.026
because I'm the aggressor.

53:11.028 --> 53:13.011
But deep down inside,

53:13.013 --> 53:16.002
I know if she's not here
I just don't function.

53:16.004 --> 53:17.023
That's how strong our bond is.

53:17.025 --> 53:19.020
LALA:
Yeah, like,
I would rather have things

53:19.022 --> 53:22.001
happen to me
than to see it happen to her.

53:22.003 --> 53:24.004
Right now,
she's going through a-a breakup,

53:24.006 --> 53:26.011
and it, like,
I want to, like, I hate it.

53:26.013 --> 53:27.021
LALA:
What is the main thing called?

53:27.023 --> 53:28.026
LULU:
Let's ask him.

53:28.028 --> 53:30.024
I feel like
this is an emotional rehab

53:30.026 --> 53:31.024
-that she needs.
-(chuckles)

53:31.026 --> 53:34.003
Perfect. Okay.

53:34.005 --> 53:36.011
RYAN:
No clue what I'm doing.

53:36.013 --> 53:38.025
Just gonna roll through it.

53:40.011 --> 53:41.025
As methodically as possible.

53:44.018 --> 53:45.019
Oh.

53:48.003 --> 53:49.028
I think this is it, so...

53:50.000 --> 53:52.006
Damn. We need the train to come.

53:52.008 --> 53:53.026
I was pretty methodical,
but, uh, not...

53:53.028 --> 53:55.019
I was, like, not getting
caught up in the-the micro,

53:55.021 --> 53:58.019
and ultimately
I was able to catch

53:58.021 --> 53:59.024
the first train out of there.

53:59.026 --> 54:01.013
Nobody's on it.

54:01.015 --> 54:02.014
What?

54:02.016 --> 54:04.000
What's happening here?

54:04.002 --> 54:06.002
All right, well, hey,
thanks for coming back for me.

54:06.004 --> 54:07.027
We got in
and out of there before

54:07.029 --> 54:10.000
even a second team showed up.

54:10.002 --> 54:11.012
Oh, yeah.
I think I see him.

54:11.014 --> 54:12.017
RYAN:
What's up, man?

54:12.019 --> 54:14.028
Oh. (whoops)

54:15.000 --> 54:15.027
Yeah, baby!

54:17.025 --> 54:21.002
"Take a taxi to Leicester Square
to find your next clue."

54:22.022 --> 54:24.018
This is Leicester Square,

54:24.020 --> 54:27.002
commonly known as theater city,

54:27.004 --> 54:28.025
and where teams
will choose a detour.

54:30.005 --> 54:31.021
DUSTY:
Yo. (whoops)

54:31.023 --> 54:32.028
RYAN:
Yeah!

54:34.007 --> 54:35.021
-RAQUEL: Right here.
-SPENCER: Go down here.

54:35.023 --> 54:37.013
"Who still gets mail?"

54:37.015 --> 54:39.003
-RAQUEL: I'm gonna do it. Okay.
-CAYLA: You do it. Okay.

54:39.005 --> 54:40.015
-I'll do it.
-Focus. You got this, okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

54:40.017 --> 54:41.023
All right, good luck,
good luck, good luck.

54:41.025 --> 54:43.005
-Quel, you're gonna crush it.
-SPENCER: Come on, Ant.

54:43.007 --> 54:45.008
-Hey, baby, we got this.
-Let's do it.

54:45.010 --> 54:47.014
CAYLA:
You got this, Raquel. Good luck!

54:47.016 --> 54:48.026
Let's go.

54:48.028 --> 54:51.006
ANTHONY:
This is cool,
little underground.

54:51.008 --> 54:52.011
RAQUEL:
This is awesome.

54:52.013 --> 54:55.013
It was a whole little
underground world

54:55.015 --> 54:56.024
that I was not aware of.

54:56.026 --> 54:58.008
ANTHONY:
We just got to search
through the mail?

54:58.010 --> 54:59.001
RAQUEL:
Yeah, we got to search
through mail.

54:59.003 --> 54:59.023
Okay, we got this.
We got this.

54:59.025 --> 55:01.020
Not sure what the clue is,

55:01.022 --> 55:03.014
but we're gonna try and find it.

55:03.016 --> 55:04.026
RAQUEL:
We just had to find the clue,

55:04.028 --> 55:07.017
and I don't really
overcomplicate things.

55:07.019 --> 55:08.027
And so I was like,
"There's no way it's in a box.

55:08.029 --> 55:09.027
It's got to be
just on the bottom."

55:09.029 --> 55:11.016
RAQUEL:
Oh, my gosh.

55:11.018 --> 55:12.029
All right, here we go.
This has to be right.

55:13.001 --> 55:14.014
Not really sure
what we're looking for.

55:14.016 --> 55:16.012
And I honestly found it
in, like, 15 seconds.

55:16.014 --> 55:19.017
Definitely, um,
a solid performance by Raquel.

55:20.027 --> 55:22.020
RAQUEL:
Wow. Jackpot, baby. Go.

55:22.022 --> 55:24.012
Wow! That was good!

55:24.014 --> 55:25.025
(whoops)

55:25.027 --> 55:27.006
Cayla's gonna be so proud of me.

55:27.008 --> 55:29.007
She left.

55:29.009 --> 55:30.014
Damn.

55:30.016 --> 55:32.006
Okay.

55:32.008 --> 55:34.016
Something that I'm missing.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.015
PENN:
Is this the mail train?

55:38.017 --> 55:40.025
-SPENCER: Hey, hey.
-CAYLA: ♪Yeah, guys. ♪

55:40.027 --> 55:41.029
-RAY: Mail Rail, right here.
-CARO: Okay.

55:43.005 --> 55:44.011
-Is it me?
-You're doing it.

55:44.013 --> 55:45.011
-You do it.
-Okay.

55:45.013 --> 55:46.011
CAYLA:
Good luck, guys.

55:46.013 --> 55:47.007
SPENCER:
Yeah, good luck.

55:51.024 --> 55:53.003
RAQUEL:
Cayla!

55:53.005 --> 55:54.000
Oh, my God, Quel!

55:56.024 --> 55:57.023
RAQUEL:
I was so fast.

55:57.025 --> 55:59.022
I'm so proud of you,
I could cry.

55:59.024 --> 56:00.025
(Raquel whoops)

56:00.027 --> 56:03.020
(indistinct chatter)

56:04.028 --> 56:06.015
-Well, that's anticlimactic.
-RAQUEL: Let's go.
-CAYLA: Good luck, guys.

56:06.017 --> 56:07.025
ANTHONY:
This is brutal.

56:07.027 --> 56:09.008
Hmm.

56:09.010 --> 56:10.004
(grunts)

56:12.004 --> 56:14.002
Yellow team showed up
and baby blue.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.002
RAY:
Here we go.

56:15.004 --> 56:16.023
Let's get it. Let's get it.

56:16.025 --> 56:17.027
PENN:
Hey, you want to work
close together?

56:17.029 --> 56:18.027
RAY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
let's do it, let's do it.

56:18.029 --> 56:20.004
Let's-let's get these two.

56:20.006 --> 56:21.009
Yeah. Okay.
Let's get it, bro.

56:24.026 --> 56:25.024
ANTHONY:
Damn, I missed that.

56:25.026 --> 56:26.029
Wasted all this time

56:27.001 --> 56:29.021
going through boxes
that it wasn't in.

56:29.023 --> 56:30.023
That's all right.

56:30.025 --> 56:32.001
I'm just waiting
on another train.

56:32.003 --> 56:33.002
Hopefully these guys
don't find it.

56:33.004 --> 56:34.028
Hopefully I get on
that train alone.

56:35.000 --> 56:35.023
One of them says
"handle with care."

56:35.025 --> 56:37.004
The other ones don't.

56:37.006 --> 56:38.013
I noticed that, too.

56:38.015 --> 56:40.003
RAY:
That might be a trick.

56:40.005 --> 56:42.001
Yeah, wait, I mean,
here's the clue.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.004
Can't be that easy, right?

56:46.006 --> 56:47.027
RAY (laughs):
Word.

56:51.029 --> 56:53.007
Is it that freaking easy?

56:53.009 --> 56:54.020
RAY:
I'm not gonna go rush back

56:54.022 --> 56:56.018
and then have to come back
and look again.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.018
Should we ask?

56:57.020 --> 56:58.027
Um...

56:58.029 --> 57:01.013
There's four people...

57:01.015 --> 57:03.003
So, it looks like
I have some company.

57:03.005 --> 57:05.003
PENN:
Anthony, you feel like
talking to us about this?

57:05.005 --> 57:07.002
It, uh...

57:07.004 --> 57:08.023
You just got to find, uh, the
one that says"Amazing Race."

57:08.025 --> 57:10.000
Like this. Look.

57:10.002 --> 57:11.012
-Looks like this.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's it.

57:11.014 --> 57:12.014
-ANTHONY: You're good.
-And we're-- Are you sure?

57:12.016 --> 57:14.007
That's what I'm doing.

57:14.009 --> 57:16.003
-I'm about to get back
on the train...
-Yeah.

57:16.005 --> 57:18.015
-...and I-- That's all I got.
-PENN: It can't be that easy.

57:18.017 --> 57:22.009
RAY:
Don't really trust
what bro is saying right now.

57:22.011 --> 57:23.027
I don't know.
He said that kind of shaky.

57:25.026 --> 57:27.016
ANTHONY:
Hopefully these guys stay

57:27.018 --> 57:28.019
and look through it
a little longer.

57:28.021 --> 57:30.005
RAY:
We're looking
for something else.

57:30.007 --> 57:31.008
PENN:
What about the stamps?

57:31.010 --> 57:32.008
I think we got to stay here.

57:32.010 --> 57:33.026
-There's something else.
-Ah.

57:36.013 --> 57:37.024
PENN:
I'm looking at postage.

57:37.026 --> 57:39.024
Some of these have
little wavy marks on them,

57:39.026 --> 57:40.024
and some of them don't.

57:40.026 --> 57:42.011
Does that make a difference?

57:42.013 --> 57:43.029
You know what, what if they
ask us about the names

57:44.001 --> 57:44.027
when we get off of it?

57:44.029 --> 57:45.025
ANTHONY:
Looks like they might stay.

57:45.027 --> 57:47.022
Why would you stay
when you found the clue?

57:47.024 --> 57:49.028
RAY:
He-he really tried to mess us
up right there, nonchalantly.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.029
PENN:
He didn't seem super honest.

57:52.001 --> 57:54.006
Oh, they stayed. Yes, yes.

57:54.008 --> 57:55.016
That's what we needed.

57:55.018 --> 57:56.028
RAY:
I'm organizing
by names right now.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.029
There's a Mr. and Mrs.

57:59.001 --> 58:00.019
-PENN: I got a ton of Lindsays.
-ANTHONY: Yellow team

58:00.021 --> 58:01.029
and baby blue stay behind.

58:02.001 --> 58:03.013
I don't know why.
They found the clue.

58:03.015 --> 58:04.006
They even asked me.

58:04.008 --> 58:05.019
I told them.

58:05.021 --> 58:07.004
Once you find
"The Amazing Race,"

58:07.006 --> 58:08.000
I don't, I don't know
what else there is to look for.

58:08.002 --> 58:10.011
RAY:
Mrs., Mrs.

58:10.013 --> 58:11.025
Mrs.

58:11.027 --> 58:14.004
Mr., Mrs., Mrs.

58:14.006 --> 58:15.020
Mr., Mrs., Mrs.

58:20.015 --> 58:21.015
PENN:
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

58:21.017 --> 58:22.011
We're looking for some type
of clue somewhere

58:22.013 --> 58:24.001
through this box of mail.

58:24.003 --> 58:25.019
PENN:
We found something
really obvious.

58:25.021 --> 58:28.004
I'm just looking through
for some type

58:28.006 --> 58:30.004
of other clue right now.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.027
I feel like
it just can't be that easy.

58:31.029 --> 58:34.000
We could also just
be overthinking this.

58:34.002 --> 58:36.000
I am a chronic overthinker.

58:36.002 --> 58:37.007
I don't know.

58:37.009 --> 58:38.018
I'm not seeing anything.

58:39.029 --> 58:41.004
I'm gonna do the Roadblock.

58:41.006 --> 58:42.015
-You. Yeah.
-Yeah.

58:42.017 --> 58:44.018
"Who still gets mail?" I do.

58:45.028 --> 58:47.008
Ay, ay, ay.

58:48.009 --> 58:49.007
RYAN:
Let's get it.

58:49.009 --> 58:51.019
-(exhales)
-Yeah, buddy.

58:51.021 --> 58:53.005
We have made
it to Leicester Square.

58:53.007 --> 58:54.024
Now it's time to find

58:54.026 --> 58:55.018
♪Red and yellow,
red and yellow. ♪

58:55.020 --> 58:57.021
-(whoops)
-Yeah.

58:57.023 --> 58:59.021
DUSTY:
♪We got us a clue box. ♪

58:59.023 --> 59:02.006
-All right, we have a detour.
-Dun, dun.

59:02.008 --> 59:05.004
KEOGHAN:
There are an estimated
five million dart players

59:05.006 --> 59:06.011
in the United Kingdom.

59:06.013 --> 59:08.000
Many of them throw it down

59:08.002 --> 59:09.010
at bars like this,

59:09.012 --> 59:10.015
Flight Club Victoria.

59:14.019 --> 59:16.011
The rules are pretty simple.

59:16.013 --> 59:19.013
All you have to do
is hit a specific target--

59:19.015 --> 59:23.010
something that teams need
to do to complete this detour.

59:23.012 --> 59:26.007
Each team member
will throw three darts.

59:30.012 --> 59:33.027
If they can both hit
a bull's-eye in the same round,

59:33.029 --> 59:35.013
they'll be rewarded with a clue.

59:35.015 --> 59:39.013
London is the most
multicultural city in Europe.

59:39.015 --> 59:43.011
And one-third of the population
here is foreign-born.

59:43.013 --> 59:44.019
In this detour,

59:44.021 --> 59:47.013
they need to decorate
two blank cakes

59:47.015 --> 59:50.011
with the nations of two flags

59:50.013 --> 59:52.021
that are part
of the European Union.

59:52.023 --> 59:56.004
If they pick the right EU
countries and the right flags,

59:56.006 --> 59:58.023
the master baker
will make their day

59:58.025 --> 1:00:00.001
and hand them a clue.

1:00:00.003 --> 1:00:02.014
We are going
to Bull's-eye Mate.

1:00:03.021 --> 1:00:05.010
PENN:
Maybe that's the clue,
and we get out of here.

1:00:05.012 --> 1:00:07.005
RAY:
Nah, bro.
I'm about to check the stamps.

1:00:07.007 --> 1:00:08.028
PENN:
I've checked 'em three times,

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.023
but, I mean, I could be
just going too fast.

1:00:10.025 --> 1:00:13.002
Maybe there's a female stamp
or something?

1:00:13.004 --> 1:00:15.007
PENN:
I hear another train.

1:00:15.009 --> 1:00:17.004
Somebody else is about
to show up.

1:00:17.006 --> 1:00:19.012
Aah! Teams are coming.
Teams are coming.

1:00:19.014 --> 1:00:22.027
PENN:
If we're wrong,
we've wasted a ton of time.

1:00:24.006 --> 1:00:26.000
Is it far away?

1:00:28.027 --> 1:00:31.010
Okay.

1:00:31.012 --> 1:00:32.025
-We have no choice.
-We don't have room for error.

1:00:32.027 --> 1:00:34.015
-We don't.
-'Cause that's it. There's...

1:00:34.017 --> 1:00:36.024
If we come in last,
we are going home.

1:00:38.008 --> 1:00:39.020
SHERI:
Let's get it.

1:00:39.022 --> 1:00:41.008
Come on. Come on, Sheri.

1:00:41.010 --> 1:00:43.000
Come on, Sheri. Let's go, baby.

1:00:43.002 --> 1:00:45.004
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

1:00:45.006 --> 1:00:47.029
E. Jones, McClain, Smith.

1:00:48.001 --> 1:00:51.025
Come on, girl. Don't overlook.
Don't overlook.

1:00:56.028 --> 1:00:59.021
Come on, girl. Come on.

1:00:59.023 --> 1:01:01.018
Come on, girl. Yes!

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:03.016
Oh, my God. Yes!

1:01:03.018 --> 1:01:05.005
-CONNIE: Is it in a box?
-SHERI: No, no.

1:01:05.007 --> 1:01:06.027
RAY:
Well, she got it. She got it.

1:01:10.002 --> 1:01:11.011
PENN:
They look excited.

1:01:11.013 --> 1:01:13.004
We might be overthinking
the hell out of this.

1:01:13.006 --> 1:01:15.017
RAY:
Yeah, we might be. We might be.

1:01:15.019 --> 1:01:19.004
I got it, I got it.

1:01:19.006 --> 1:01:20.027
RAY:
It could be that simple,

1:01:20.029 --> 1:01:24.027
-and we just... overthought it.
-PENN: There's nothing here.

1:01:24.029 --> 1:01:26.009
PENN:
Everyone else immediately
gets a clue,

1:01:26.011 --> 1:01:27.019
and they get in line
for the train.

1:01:27.021 --> 1:01:29.000
Did everybody find it
at the same time?

1:01:29.002 --> 1:01:30.016
No, we've had them for a while.

1:01:30.018 --> 1:01:31.025
-We just, like...
-We were here for,
like, 30 minutes.

1:01:31.027 --> 1:01:33.029
-CONNIE: Oh, my gosh.
-PENN: And I'm like,

1:01:34.001 --> 1:01:35.025
"What are y'all doing?" They're
like, "What are you doing?"

1:01:35.027 --> 1:01:37.015
"Get on the train.
You got the clue."

1:01:37.017 --> 1:01:39.010
Yo, we could have overthought
it, bro. It could have been

1:01:39.012 --> 1:01:40.029
-a mind game with us going
through the mail, waiting.
-Yeah.

1:01:41.001 --> 1:01:41.027
PENN:
And you know how

1:01:41.029 --> 1:01:43.007
they knew it was the clue?

1:01:43.009 --> 1:01:44.027
-'Cause it was a clue.
-(laughs)

1:01:44.029 --> 1:01:46.013
(laughter and chatter)

1:01:46.015 --> 1:01:48.021
"Who still gets mail?"

1:01:48.023 --> 1:01:50.023
-I'll do it.
-Okay, you'll do it?

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.015
Good job.

1:01:53.017 --> 1:01:54.027
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1:01:54.029 --> 1:01:56.021
-I screwed this up so bad.
-You didn't, honey.

1:01:56.023 --> 1:01:58.015
-Leicester Square.
-"Leicester Square
to find your next clue."

1:01:58.017 --> 1:01:59.027
I found it 30 minutes ago.

1:01:59.029 --> 1:02:01.002
ISAIAH:
A few teams just finished

1:02:01.004 --> 1:02:02.012
ahead of us,

1:02:02.014 --> 1:02:05.006
so we have to just be smart.

1:02:05.008 --> 1:02:07.002
Does the door open
a special way?

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.005
Uh, just step over it?

1:02:10.007 --> 1:02:13.021
Ah, the switch. (laughs)
Look, I'm thinking too hard.

1:02:13.023 --> 1:02:16.002
AKBAR: I chose the first
Roadblock, but when we read it,

1:02:16.004 --> 1:02:18.011
It said, "Search for something."

1:02:18.013 --> 1:02:19.027
I was like,
"I'm the worst at that."

1:02:19.029 --> 1:02:22.022
-So thank you, Sheri.
-SHERI: No problem.

1:02:22.024 --> 1:02:24.021
CARO:
Okay, so what happened?

1:02:24.023 --> 1:02:26.016
We found this 30 minutes ago.

1:02:26.018 --> 1:02:27.029
Then why didn't you go up
if you had the clue?

1:02:28.001 --> 1:02:30.022
I just don't think
someone has any right

1:02:30.024 --> 1:02:32.003
to give me advice
on the situation.

1:02:32.005 --> 1:02:33.004
They don't even know
what it looked like.

1:02:33.006 --> 1:02:34.017
CARO:
For future reference,

1:02:34.019 --> 1:02:35.023
this says,"The Amazing Race."

1:02:35.025 --> 1:02:37.008
That would be a clue.

1:02:37.010 --> 1:02:39.008
RAY:
Next Roadblock you execute

1:02:39.010 --> 1:02:41.001
in two minutes.
You got it? Word.

1:02:41.003 --> 1:02:42.018
CARO:
Being in

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:46.001
a new relationship,
and also it being long distance,

1:02:46.003 --> 1:02:48.003
you don't know much
about the person

1:02:48.005 --> 1:02:49.014
when it comes
to stressful situations

1:02:49.016 --> 1:02:51.020
like this 'cause
we've both never been like that.

1:02:51.022 --> 1:02:54.028
-You're so rude.
-I don't care. Facts.
It is what it is.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.004
I'd never seen him
in a stressful situation.

1:03:02.025 --> 1:03:05.017
CARO: Okay, so now we have
to just collect our cool

1:03:05.019 --> 1:03:07.015
-so that we can work together.
-I'm good. I'm good.

1:03:07.017 --> 1:03:09.022
-Okay, you're good?
-I'm good.

1:03:09.024 --> 1:03:11.025
CARO:
Anyways, okay, so now we're off,

1:03:11.027 --> 1:03:15.002
and hopefully we can work
as a team when we get there.

1:03:16.009 --> 1:03:18.007
TAYLOR:
Nothing there. Keep going.

1:03:20.021 --> 1:03:22.016
There's a lot of mail.

1:03:22.018 --> 1:03:25.005
ISAIAH:
I do not see him,
but hopefully my husband

1:03:25.007 --> 1:03:26.025
is digging through that mail

1:03:26.027 --> 1:03:28.003
to find that next clue.

1:03:28.005 --> 1:03:31.002
Aha! Success!

1:03:31.004 --> 1:03:33.002
Just hoping that the twins
don't get here, um,

1:03:33.004 --> 1:03:35.015
because we want to stay
in this race.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.011
-I'll do it. Okay, I'll do it.
-You do it.

1:03:38.013 --> 1:03:39.023
TAYLOR:
We're actually back

1:03:39.025 --> 1:03:41.010
to our station.

1:03:41.012 --> 1:03:42.025
Does he have a clue?
Hopefully not.

1:03:42.027 --> 1:03:44.012
The pink team is here.

1:03:44.014 --> 1:03:45.021
-Okay, this is Taylor.
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:45.023 --> 1:03:47.013
ISAIAH:
"Lei-cester..."

1:03:47.015 --> 1:03:49.012
BOTH:
"Square to find your next clue."

1:03:49.014 --> 1:03:52.000
-(beeping)
-Okay, we're rocking,
we're rolling. Here we go.

1:03:54.002 --> 1:03:55.010
-(mumbles)
-Okay, we're gonna decorate.

1:03:55.012 --> 1:03:56.025
-We're gonna decorate. Let's go.
-Come on.

1:03:56.027 --> 1:03:58.016
-We're gonna do decorate.
-Decorate the cake.

1:03:58.018 --> 1:04:00.014
We know the EU pretty well.

1:04:00.016 --> 1:04:01.008
-My guy!
-You think that's him?

1:04:01.010 --> 1:04:02.028
Let's go, baby.

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.029
We're getting back in.

1:04:07.016 --> 1:04:09.018
61 Central Street, London.

1:04:11.009 --> 1:04:12.018
-Yep, yep. Got it all.
-Time to slang 'em.
-Here you go.

1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:13.023
All right, thank you.
Let's do it.

1:04:13.025 --> 1:04:15.006
DUSTY:
Flight Club.

1:04:15.008 --> 1:04:16.029
Well,
I'm a dart-slanging savage.

1:04:17.001 --> 1:04:18.027
Um, I spent a lot of time
in my younger days

1:04:18.029 --> 1:04:20.021
with buddies in the garage
playing a ton of darts.

1:04:20.023 --> 1:04:22.018
We saw a pint in there, too,

1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:24.016
so we were like, "Okay, so maybe
it's the best of both worlds."

1:04:24.018 --> 1:04:27.021
-Cheers, my friend.
Well deserved.
-To anAmazing Race.

1:04:27.023 --> 1:04:29.028
-This is so awesome.
-Pints go here?

1:04:31.010 --> 1:04:32.018
Let's go.

1:04:32.020 --> 1:04:35.000
Oh, nice.

1:04:35.002 --> 1:04:37.022
We got to get two bull's-eyes
in one round.

1:04:37.024 --> 1:04:40.005
Yeah, we'll get 'em, baby.
If you get one, we're good.

1:04:40.007 --> 1:04:43.019
Just eyeball it, dude.
You got it.

1:04:43.021 --> 1:04:46.002
Oh, you're right there.

1:04:46.004 --> 1:04:48.019
-(buzzer sounds)
-Ah, you're good, dude.

1:04:48.021 --> 1:04:49.025
You're get...
you're getting better.

1:04:49.027 --> 1:04:51.007
ARUN:
Thank you, sir.

1:04:51.009 --> 1:04:52.007
-Thank you.
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

1:04:52.009 --> 1:04:53.020
Thank you.

1:04:53.022 --> 1:04:55.010
There it is. I see it. There!

1:04:55.012 --> 1:04:56.019
-Where?
-There, there, there, there.

1:04:58.019 --> 1:04:59.009
Let's do the cake. Cake. Cake.

1:04:59.011 --> 1:05:00.028
Uh, we can try the cake.

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.005
-I think the bull's-eye.
-We'll do the bull's-eye.

1:05:02.007 --> 1:05:06.004
How long do you think
it'll be there to get there?

1:05:06.006 --> 1:05:08.001
Okay, yeah.

1:05:08.003 --> 1:05:09.025
-Huh? I'm sorry?
-NATALIA: Oh, the bull's-eye.

1:05:09.027 --> 1:05:11.016
-ARUN: Bull's...
-Bull's-eye. Okay.

1:05:11.018 --> 1:05:12.018
-What are you guys doing?
-NATALIA: The cake?
-The cake.

1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:14.018
-Okay.
-Okay. Good luck!

1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.004
Hope you don't find it.

1:05:16.006 --> 1:05:18.002
(both laughing)

1:05:26.008 --> 1:05:28.003
(sighs)

1:05:28.005 --> 1:05:30.014
-I was, um, second...
guessing myself.
-Guessing?

1:05:30.016 --> 1:05:34.000
We doubt ourselves a lot,
but she depends on me, and

1:05:34.002 --> 1:05:35.019
it's a million dollars
on the line,

1:05:35.021 --> 1:05:36.020
so I don't want
to disappoint her.

1:05:39.001 --> 1:05:40.012
Oh.

1:05:42.012 --> 1:05:44.006
We're still in this.

1:05:51.007 --> 1:05:52.017
We're gonna do decorate.

1:05:52.019 --> 1:05:54.014
-We're choosing Bull's-eye Mate.
-Bull's-eye Mate.

1:05:54.016 --> 1:05:55.019
-We're gonna decorate cakes.
-We're gonna decorate cakes.

1:06:00.018 --> 1:06:02.029
-(laughs)
-Hi. We're here.

1:06:03.001 --> 1:06:05.011
-Okay, we just pick a station?
-Oh, wow.

1:06:05.013 --> 1:06:06.027
-Oh, yes.
-CAYLA: Okay, let's look
at all of them.

1:06:06.029 --> 1:06:08.001
Okay,
we have to decorate two cakes

1:06:08.003 --> 1:06:10.002
with the flags
of the European Union,

1:06:10.004 --> 1:06:11.026
so I don't know if all of these

1:06:11.028 --> 1:06:12.020
on the table
are from the European Union,

1:06:12.022 --> 1:06:14.013
but we know that this one is.

1:06:14.015 --> 1:06:16.027
RAQUEL: Yeah, the France flag.
So let's start with that.

1:06:16.029 --> 1:06:18.006
-Okay, let's do...
-And then it's blue underneath.

1:06:18.008 --> 1:06:19.020
Okay, but which blue?

1:06:19.022 --> 1:06:21.002
-Okay, so there's blue frosting.
-Which blue?

1:06:21.004 --> 1:06:22.013
-Is it this blue?
-It's that blue, yeah.

1:06:22.015 --> 1:06:24.003
Just one-third of the way,

1:06:24.005 --> 1:06:25.015
and then start the last...
That's good. That's good.

1:06:25.017 --> 1:06:27.003
-Okay, now you smear.
-Now I start there.

1:06:27.005 --> 1:06:29.000
Get it all on the edge.

1:06:29.002 --> 1:06:30.017
RAQUEL:
It's perfect.
Look how nice it looks.

1:06:30.019 --> 1:06:31.018
-All right,
let's start bluebin'.
-Two...

1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:32.029
CAYLA:
I really want to start
on another cake,

1:06:33.001 --> 1:06:35.008
but I don't know
which other flag.

1:06:35.010 --> 1:06:36.019
-RAQUEL: I would do this one.
-'Cause we know that it's that?

1:06:36.021 --> 1:06:37.019
RAQUEL:
Yeah, 'cause you know.

1:06:37.021 --> 1:06:39.004
Ooh.

1:06:39.006 --> 1:06:43.006
(laughing):
Raquel, it's all over the thing.

1:06:43.008 --> 1:06:44.015
(both laughing)

1:06:44.017 --> 1:06:48.012
(indistinct chatter)

1:06:48.014 --> 1:06:49.006
We're gonna get this later.
We're gonna get it later.

1:06:49.008 --> 1:06:50.020
(laughs)

1:06:50.022 --> 1:06:54.001
You're digging for the clues.

1:06:54.003 --> 1:06:57.004
Thank you.

1:06:57.006 --> 1:06:58.006
I got it.

1:07:03.002 --> 1:07:04.008
Pull back and open one side.

1:07:05.014 --> 1:07:08.009
-No! Hi!
-Hello. What's up, guys?

1:07:08.011 --> 1:07:09.027
-What's up? What's up?
-Hey.

1:07:09.029 --> 1:07:11.027
-SPENCER: Okay, let's look.
-ANTHONY: We can do any one?

1:07:11.029 --> 1:07:13.029
These are not all
in the European Union.

1:07:14.001 --> 1:07:15.015
ANTHONY:
Let's just do the UK.

1:07:15.017 --> 1:07:17.019
They're not
in the European Union anymore.

1:07:17.021 --> 1:07:19.021
ANTHONY:
Ah, you're right, you're right,

1:07:19.023 --> 1:07:21.002
-This is. This is.
-SPENCER: I don't think
that's it.

1:07:21.004 --> 1:07:22.028
ANTHONY:
It is, bro.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:24.013
-I have clothes
that have this on here.
-Well, it doesn't...

1:07:24.015 --> 1:07:25.026
-Yes, it is.
-For who? Who is that?

1:07:25.028 --> 1:07:26.028
ANTHONY:
I don't know, but it is.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.021
How you gonna be so confident?

1:07:28.023 --> 1:07:31.022
I have a jacket that has
that flag on it. That's how.

1:07:31.024 --> 1:07:33.012
Okay.

1:07:33.014 --> 1:07:34.017
ANTHONY:
You want to do that one?

1:07:34.019 --> 1:07:35.026
SPENCER:
I'm-I'm gonna do this one.

1:07:35.028 --> 1:07:36.026
ANTHONY:
And I'll do this one.

1:07:36.028 --> 1:07:37.022
-SPENCER: Okay.
-Okay.

1:07:41.014 --> 1:07:43.002
Get it, boy.

1:07:48.024 --> 1:07:51.019
-In!
-Yeah.

1:07:51.021 --> 1:07:52.025
Ooh, baby!

1:07:54.019 --> 1:07:56.029
What do we got?
Route Info.

1:07:57.001 --> 1:07:59.018
♪ ♪

1:07:59.020 --> 1:08:05.002
London buses transport over six
million passengers every day.

1:08:05.004 --> 1:08:07.029
And the most famous bus
of them all

1:08:08.001 --> 1:08:09.027
would have
to be the double decker.

1:08:09.029 --> 1:08:12.023
A perfect place for a cup of tea

1:08:12.025 --> 1:08:14.017
and a Pit Stop
for this leg of the race

1:08:14.019 --> 1:08:16.025
here in Russell Square
metro station.

1:08:18.019 --> 1:08:20.028
We need you to haul us
to our final destination, bro.

1:08:23.019 --> 1:08:24.021
NATALIA:
This is it-- Flight Club.
Right here. We're here.

1:08:24.023 --> 1:08:27.027
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1:08:27.029 --> 1:08:29.006
Awesome.

1:08:30.020 --> 1:08:32.018
NATALIA:
Let's do this.

1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:34.015
You can do it, Nat.

1:08:34.017 --> 1:08:35.024
Don't overthink, okay?

1:08:35.026 --> 1:08:38.008
Oh, God.

1:08:38.010 --> 1:08:40.000
You'll get it, okay?

1:08:40.002 --> 1:08:42.021
Need another sip of beer.
Good job.

1:08:45.022 --> 1:08:46.022
(Arun inhales sharply)

1:08:46.024 --> 1:08:49.015
That circle's very small.

1:08:49.017 --> 1:08:51.022
ISAIAH:
We are gonna decorate cakes.

1:08:51.024 --> 1:08:53.025
I think it's something you'd
be really good at-- decorating.

1:08:53.027 --> 1:08:56.004
TAYLOR:
I just hope it moves fast.

1:08:56.006 --> 1:08:58.005
SPENCER:
Me and Anthony are actually

1:08:58.007 --> 1:09:00.006
American and French citizens.

1:09:00.008 --> 1:09:02.019
We got our citizenships
through the Legion of Honor

1:09:02.021 --> 1:09:04.018
after our terrorist attack
on a train headed to Paris.

1:09:06.007 --> 1:09:08.005
No. Disrespectful if we didn't
pick the French flag.

1:09:08.007 --> 1:09:09.019
Cayla, what flag are you doing?

1:09:09.021 --> 1:09:11.028
-Uh, Great Britain.
-Great Britain?

1:09:14.027 --> 1:09:17.019
-You know that.
-Mm. Mm.

1:09:17.021 --> 1:09:19.029
-(both laugh)
-Oui. Oui.

1:09:20.001 --> 1:09:24.013
-RAY: Ugh.
-Bye.

1:09:24.015 --> 1:09:26.000
Can you lead the way?

1:09:26.002 --> 1:09:28.021
Oh, there's, like,
some poop down there.

1:09:28.023 --> 1:09:30.021
-Yeah.
-It's my kind of day.

1:09:30.023 --> 1:09:32.019
How you doing?

1:09:32.021 --> 1:09:33.027
-Um, choose a station?
-Hi, guys.

1:09:33.029 --> 1:09:35.014
What's going on?

1:09:35.016 --> 1:09:37.002
Let's go.
Let's bake some cakes, baby.

1:09:37.004 --> 1:09:38.027
-Penn.
-Yeah, yeah, right here.

1:09:38.029 --> 1:09:41.019
-Pull it back.
-Okay, who else is here?

1:09:41.021 --> 1:09:43.026
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

1:09:43.028 --> 1:09:45.017
-Excuse me.
-RAQUEL: Good job, guys.
-RAY: Hey, what's up?

1:09:45.019 --> 1:09:47.021
-RAY: You know which flag it is?
-CARO: Yeah. Okay.

1:09:47.023 --> 1:09:49.019
-Let's just start this one--
Germany. I know it.
-Okay.

1:09:49.021 --> 1:09:51.004
RAQUEL:
It started off with just us,

1:09:51.006 --> 1:09:54.006
and now there are four teams
currently here.

1:09:54.008 --> 1:09:55.012
-Let's do this one and this one.
-Okay.

1:09:55.014 --> 1:09:57.015
Okay.

1:09:57.017 --> 1:09:59.009
CARO:
So right now,
I'm doing the German flag.

1:09:59.011 --> 1:10:02.004
I moved to Germany
for six years.

1:10:02.006 --> 1:10:03.025
And the detour was, recreate

1:10:03.027 --> 1:10:05.016
two countries
from the European Union,

1:10:05.018 --> 1:10:07.001
so I knew them right away.

1:10:07.003 --> 1:10:09.008
I was like "Germany, France.
Like, easy."

1:10:11.014 --> 1:10:13.018
It says,
make our way downstairs.

1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:15.003
-Downstairs
to the downstairs bar.
-Downs...

1:10:16.010 --> 1:10:18.012
Can I get, um, two pints
and darts, please?

1:10:18.014 --> 1:10:20.013
-Of course.
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

1:10:21.019 --> 1:10:23.017
-Oh, that was close.
-CONNIE: Hey, guys.

1:10:23.019 --> 1:10:25.014
-ARUN: Hey.
-NATALIA: Hey.

1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:27.027
NATALIA:
That's in. That's in.

1:10:27.029 --> 1:10:29.010
Ready?

1:10:30.008 --> 1:10:31.023
-It's gonna get worse.
-Babe, you got to throw it.

1:10:31.025 --> 1:10:33.002
-(Connie sighs)
-A little bit firmer.

1:10:34.010 --> 1:10:36.003
CONNIE:
Shoot!

1:10:36.005 --> 1:10:37.021
ARUN: Come on, Nat.
You can do it.

1:10:37.023 --> 1:10:39.021
-NATALIA: Damn it.
-Nat.

1:10:39.023 --> 1:10:42.027
-This is not gonna work, okay?
-Okay.

1:10:42.029 --> 1:10:45.011
-You're trying to push it.
It's not gonna work.
-Yeah.

1:10:45.013 --> 1:10:47.011
-Okay. Okay.
-You just have to be firm
about your throws.

1:10:49.019 --> 1:10:52.000
-(sighs)
-It's okay. Follow your eye.
Watch this.

1:10:52.002 --> 1:10:54.001
-See how I, like,
look down the barrel?
-Yeah.

1:10:54.003 --> 1:10:55.028
All right, over my shoulder.

1:10:57.027 --> 1:10:59.009
-Oh, great.
-See, that was a bull's-eye.

1:10:59.011 --> 1:11:00.011
I throw darts a little bit.

1:11:01.009 --> 1:11:04.012
Oh, you got it now.
You're doing good.

1:11:04.014 --> 1:11:06.014
Connie-- she had to warm up
her arm a little bit, though.

1:11:06.016 --> 1:11:08.019
She was... It was
at this long arc.

1:11:08.021 --> 1:11:10.027
I was just like, "Oh, my God."

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.013
You might miss it ten times.
Just keep firing.

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:17.017
-I see it. Ready?
-Damn.

1:11:17.019 --> 1:11:19.012
Detour.

1:11:19.014 --> 1:11:20.022
-Okay.
-Let's see.

1:11:20.024 --> 1:11:23.023
-SHERI: Come on. Right here.
-Knock, knock.

1:11:23.025 --> 1:11:26.008
All right,
so everyone's still here.

1:11:26.010 --> 1:11:28.005
Can we get a check?

1:11:28.007 --> 1:11:30.020
-Hello.
-Hello. Wonderful.

1:11:31.028 --> 1:11:35.006
-Thank you. So you're going
for France and Britain, yeah?
-Yes.

1:11:35.008 --> 1:11:37.010
Good.

1:11:37.012 --> 1:11:38.027
Britain's not in the EU.

1:11:38.029 --> 1:11:41.005
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. You were doing...

1:11:41.007 --> 1:11:42.022
-It's okay. It's not a big deal.
Don't worry.
-Okay.

1:11:42.024 --> 1:11:43.021
-We'll redo it. Yeah. Yeah.
-Brexit, right?

1:11:43.023 --> 1:11:44.027
CAYLA:
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.017
-So I'm not gonna judge that.
-Okay.

1:11:46.019 --> 1:11:49.003
It's lovely, actually,
but let's have a look at France.

1:11:49.005 --> 1:11:51.028
(mumbling)

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.018
Yeah, I'm happy about that.

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:55.021
-Okay.
-Should I just leave this?

1:11:55.023 --> 1:11:56.026
-Do I take it back up?
-Take it back up.

1:11:56.028 --> 1:11:58.004
I'm gonna cry.

1:11:58.006 --> 1:11:59.028
Check! Can we take it down,
do a cake check?

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.012
Can we take it down?

1:12:01.014 --> 1:12:04.016
-You guys good?
-No.
-No.

1:12:04.018 --> 1:12:06.027
-Good luck, guys.
-Thanks.
-Good luck.

1:12:06.029 --> 1:12:08.009
Just start over
and pick a new one?

1:12:08.011 --> 1:12:10.003
We're gonna do Germany.
That one's easy.

1:12:10.005 --> 1:12:11.026
-How are you?
-MAN: Good. How are we?

1:12:11.028 --> 1:12:13.001
-Good.
-What have you brought for me?

1:12:13.003 --> 1:12:14.012
Let's see what you say.

1:12:14.014 --> 1:12:15.028
Well, we got a little
French flag here for you.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.004
So, France-- in the EU. Good.
This one-- not so much.

1:12:20.006 --> 1:12:21.023
Have to strike this one,
I'm afraid.

1:12:21.025 --> 1:12:24.024
But I can have a look
at this one. France.

1:12:24.026 --> 1:12:27.002
-Yeah, that's spot on.
-SPENCER: Okay.

1:12:27.004 --> 1:12:30.014
We got one flag
out of the European Union,

1:12:30.016 --> 1:12:32.010
but we know which one
we need to do now.

1:12:32.012 --> 1:12:35.009
Is it on the other side
of the square?

1:12:35.011 --> 1:12:37.013
DUSTY:
Bernard Street is right there,
my man.

1:12:37.015 --> 1:12:39.012
RYAN:
Right there.

1:12:39.014 --> 1:12:40.016
Let's go.

1:12:42.014 --> 1:12:44.005
-KEOGHAN: Hey, guys.
-Hello.

1:12:44.007 --> 1:12:46.015
KEOGHAN:
Welcome to a double decker bus
here in London.

1:12:46.017 --> 1:12:47.025
-You had a good day?
-We have a great day.
-Pretty good.

1:12:47.027 --> 1:12:48.025
-I think it's...
-Soaked to the bone,

1:12:48.027 --> 1:12:50.005
but it was a hell of a run, man.

1:12:50.007 --> 1:12:51.020
Would you like a cup of tea
before you leave?

1:12:51.022 --> 1:12:53.021
-Cup of tea would be fantastic.
-Cup of tea, okay.

1:12:53.023 --> 1:12:55.015
-DUSTY: Thank you so much.
-RYAN: Oh.
-Do you have any idea where

1:12:55.017 --> 1:12:56.011
-you're placed right now?
-We think we're first.

1:12:56.013 --> 1:12:57.029
-You do?
-We feel very confident in that.

1:12:58.001 --> 1:13:00.029
-We believe so, yeah.
-Okay. You are team number one.

1:13:01.001 --> 1:13:03.024
-(Ryan whooping)
-DUSTY (whooping): All day, baby

1:13:03.026 --> 1:13:05.017
Man, what a day it's been.

1:13:05.019 --> 1:13:06.016
RYAN:
Thank you.

1:13:09.026 --> 1:13:10.019
-Bull's-eye.
-Nice.

1:13:10.021 --> 1:13:12.017
SAM:
Let's go.

1:13:12.019 --> 1:13:14.007
ARUN:
Yeah, good job!

1:13:14.009 --> 1:13:16.009
Come on, Arun. You got this.

1:13:16.011 --> 1:13:17.029
SAM:
Aah.

1:13:20.009 --> 1:13:22.012
-CONNIE: Shoot.
-SAM: Good try. Good try.

1:13:22.014 --> 1:13:24.007
-ARUN: God.
-NATALIA: You got this one, Dad.

1:13:24.009 --> 1:13:25.004
You got this.

1:13:27.022 --> 1:13:29.017
(Arun gasps)

1:13:29.019 --> 1:13:30.028
CONNIE: Maybe I need to drink
some more of the beer.

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.008
SAM:
What are we gonna do?

1:13:32.010 --> 1:13:33.023
Bull's-eye!

1:13:33.025 --> 1:13:36.004
-How are you doing that?
-Just throw it in there.

1:13:37.013 --> 1:13:40.005
Oh! Good throw.

1:13:40.007 --> 1:13:42.016
-Yes!
-(whooping)

1:13:42.018 --> 1:13:44.025
Let's go.

1:13:44.027 --> 1:13:46.013
-All right.
-Okay, thank you so much.

1:13:46.015 --> 1:13:47.022
Do we have to drink the beer
or anything, or we...?

1:13:47.024 --> 1:13:48.021
No, we don't have to drink it.

1:13:48.023 --> 1:13:50.012
SAM:
Okay.

1:13:50.014 --> 1:13:52.016
Okay, now I am...
I need to concentrate.

1:13:52.018 --> 1:13:55.008
SAM: Good job, baby!
I knew you could do it.

1:13:57.009 --> 1:14:00.027
We let the other team,
which came in, beat us.

1:14:00.029 --> 1:14:03.023
-(buzzer sounds)
-Nat.
-Yeah, I'm not concentrating.

1:14:03.025 --> 1:14:06.002
-Yeah, take a deep breath.
-Do you think we should switch

1:14:06.004 --> 1:14:06.027
to the other detour?

1:14:18.007 --> 1:14:19.012
NATALIA:
I think

1:14:19.014 --> 1:14:21.004
I go first 'cause I...

1:14:21.006 --> 1:14:22.013
It's harder for me
when you have it, and I think

1:14:22.015 --> 1:14:24.003
-you have more skill at this,
so...
-Yeah.

1:14:24.005 --> 1:14:25.020
Oy.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.018
-(whooping)
-Yeah! Yes!

1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:30.027
Good job. Good job. Good job.

1:14:30.029 --> 1:14:32.010
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1:14:33.015 --> 1:14:34.025
Okay, is this it?

1:14:34.027 --> 1:14:36.025
-Yeah.
-Okay, we're here.

1:14:36.027 --> 1:14:39.008
We have to put our stuff down
and get to work.

1:14:39.010 --> 1:14:40.019
I'm looking to see
what everybody else is doing.

1:14:40.021 --> 1:14:42.022
Yeah, these two. Let's go.

1:14:43.028 --> 1:14:45.004
-Let's do-do Germany.
-Yeah.

1:14:45.006 --> 1:14:47.008
-My bad.
-You're good.

1:14:47.010 --> 1:14:49.004
I have to now do
a completely different flag.

1:14:49.006 --> 1:14:51.015
I would like
to set the record straight.

1:14:51.017 --> 1:14:54.010
I knew about Brexit.

1:14:54.012 --> 1:14:56.005
I didn't know
that it actually had happened

1:14:56.007 --> 1:14:58.025
and that they did exit.

1:14:58.027 --> 1:15:00.014
She doesn't watch the news.
None.

1:15:00.016 --> 1:15:03.004
I literally
don't watch any news.

1:15:03.006 --> 1:15:05.005
CAYLA:
I learned
that ignorance is not bliss

1:15:05.007 --> 1:15:07.005
-inThe Amazing Race.
That's for sure.
-Apparently.

1:15:07.007 --> 1:15:09.004
Okay.

1:15:09.006 --> 1:15:12.007
I am panicking that we...
we're not clean enough here.

1:15:12.009 --> 1:15:14.025
-PENN: Then they'll tell us,
and we'll come right back up.
-Okay.

1:15:14.027 --> 1:15:16.016
KIM:
Going down to get checked.

1:15:16.018 --> 1:15:17.027
We have some gorgeous cakes
for you.

1:15:17.029 --> 1:15:19.012
MAN (laughing):
Oh, you do?

1:15:19.014 --> 1:15:20.029
-They're beautiful.
-They're cakes.

1:15:21.001 --> 1:15:22.029
So, what have we got?
We've got Germany?

1:15:23.001 --> 1:15:24.005
-Yes.
-Yup.
-And, uh, Norway, right?

1:15:24.007 --> 1:15:26.020
-Yes.
-So you got one of them right.

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:29.005
-Okay.
-Norway is not
in the EU, I'm afraid.

1:15:29.007 --> 1:15:32.007
Is this cake okay?

1:15:34.029 --> 1:15:35.027
Thank you.

1:15:37.007 --> 1:15:38.023
SAM:
Let's do it.

1:15:38.025 --> 1:15:40.002
-Let's do it.
-Thank you, sir.

1:15:40.004 --> 1:15:41.018
Let's go up here.

1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:43.018
-Hi, Phil.
-Grab a seat right here.

1:15:43.020 --> 1:15:44.026
You guys had a good day today.

1:15:44.028 --> 1:15:46.020
-CONNIE: We did.
-SAM: Yeah.

1:15:46.022 --> 1:15:49.016
-You know where you are?
-We're on the big bu... red bus.

1:15:49.018 --> 1:15:51.005
-Yes, you are.
-At the Pit Stop, baby.
-Pit Stop.

1:15:51.007 --> 1:15:53.016
-You're crushing it, Raquel.
-Thank you.

1:15:53.018 --> 1:15:55.023
-CAYLA: Good job, good job.
Think we're okay.
-Okay.

1:15:55.025 --> 1:15:57.016
-I think we're good, yeah.
-Okay, we're gonna go
try it again.

1:15:57.018 --> 1:15:59.027
SPENCER:
Get that thing in there.

1:15:59.029 --> 1:16:01.026
-I'm gonna lock her in
real quick.
-Lock it in.

1:16:01.028 --> 1:16:04.008
-I brought the...
-You know...
-Again. How we doing?

1:16:04.010 --> 1:16:05.026
We just missed you,
so we thought

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:07.021
-we'd come back
as quick as possible.
-Yeah.

1:16:07.023 --> 1:16:09.026
Nice. So, France, Germany, yeah?

1:16:09.028 --> 1:16:12.004
-Yes. Mwah.
-Mwah. Perfect.

1:16:12.006 --> 1:16:14.017
Yeah, Germany's good for me.

1:16:14.019 --> 1:16:17.006
(cheering)

1:16:17.008 --> 1:16:18.022
-Well done.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

1:16:18.024 --> 1:16:19.022
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:16:19.024 --> 1:16:22.001
Grab our backpacks, let's go.

1:16:22.003 --> 1:16:24.014
-Good job, guys.
You're gonna do it.
-You got it. You got it.

1:16:24.016 --> 1:16:27.004
The purple team just got it.
You know, good for them.

1:16:27.006 --> 1:16:29.008
Walking to get judged.

1:16:29.010 --> 1:16:32.013
-Hello, sir.
-MAN: Hello, boys.

1:16:32.015 --> 1:16:35.006
-Very nice.
Well, right flag, so, well done.
-Thank you.

1:16:35.008 --> 1:16:36.016
Bang-on, boys.

1:16:36.018 --> 1:16:38.013
I'm happy with Germany.

1:16:38.015 --> 1:16:41.003
-Yes, thank you.
-My man! Thank you.

1:16:41.005 --> 1:16:43.008
My man. All right.

1:16:43.010 --> 1:16:44.008
(grunting)

1:16:44.010 --> 1:16:46.005
Roll the dice. Aah!

1:16:46.007 --> 1:16:48.007
TAYLOR:
I'm not really sure
if this is right.

1:16:48.009 --> 1:16:49.010
I mean, we can kind of see
what everybody's doing.

1:16:49.012 --> 1:16:50.023
Oh, you're right.

1:16:50.025 --> 1:16:52.023
So let's...
Everyone's doing the peaches,

1:16:52.025 --> 1:16:54.013
the red, the white and the blue.

1:16:54.015 --> 1:16:57.000
PENN:
He told us to clean up
the blackberry stains,

1:16:57.002 --> 1:16:58.010
and I'm doing what I can
with that.

1:16:58.012 --> 1:17:01.009
-Right here.
-Pull back and... Oh.

1:17:02.007 --> 1:17:05.019
Okay.

1:17:05.021 --> 1:17:06.028
Look at the girls.

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.003
ISAIAH:
Ooh, this is crunch time.

1:17:09.005 --> 1:17:10.015
So we got some pressure
on us now,

1:17:10.017 --> 1:17:12.009
but we're-we're confident
we're gonna do well,

1:17:12.011 --> 1:17:14.012
so we still have a shot.

1:17:14.014 --> 1:17:15.017
Which one do we want to do?

1:17:15.019 --> 1:17:17.013
Let's do this one.

1:17:17.015 --> 1:17:19.001
I'm gonna start
on the other one-- France.

1:17:19.003 --> 1:17:21.009
We finally made it
to the cake place,

1:17:21.011 --> 1:17:23.009
and when we got there,
there was...

1:17:23.011 --> 1:17:25.011
BOTH:
One, two, three, four...

1:17:25.013 --> 1:17:26.019
...teams, I believe.
We still have a chance.

1:17:26.021 --> 1:17:27.023
They're not too far ahead.

1:17:27.025 --> 1:17:30.003
So that gave me some ease.

1:17:30.005 --> 1:17:32.011
AKBAR:
Come on, Sheri.
This is clutch time, baby.

1:17:32.013 --> 1:17:33.015
-KIM: Tell me when you're ready.
-PENN: Let's go.

1:17:33.017 --> 1:17:34.026
AKBAR:
They got it.

1:17:36.018 --> 1:17:38.005
-Hey, man, how are you?
-KIM: Hello, Chef.

1:17:38.007 --> 1:17:39.016
-Very good. How did it go?
-Good to see you again.

1:17:39.018 --> 1:17:41.016
-And you, and you.
-So we got the blackberry done.

1:17:41.018 --> 1:17:42.029
-Yeah. Great.
-Blackberry's gone.

1:17:43.001 --> 1:17:45.016
-And look at this beauty.
-Wow.

1:17:45.018 --> 1:17:46.022
That's gorgeous.
Yup, blue and white.

1:17:47.028 --> 1:17:50.010
Lovely. Really nice lines
on here, as well.

1:17:50.012 --> 1:17:52.014
-Mm-hmm.
-(mumbling)

1:17:54.002 --> 1:17:55.016
Yeah, I'm happy with them, too.

1:17:55.018 --> 1:17:56.025
-Come on!
-I'm really happy with them.

1:17:56.027 --> 1:17:59.000
-Well done.
-Thank you, sir.

1:17:59.002 --> 1:18:02.011
We feel good about our choices,
but I love baking.

1:18:02.013 --> 1:18:04.022
-I bake cakes all the time.
-You got it, you got it.

1:18:04.024 --> 1:18:06.000
-We'll see you all soon.
We'll see you all soon.
-Good job.

1:18:06.002 --> 1:18:08.017
-Cake check.
-Cake check.

1:18:08.019 --> 1:18:09.025
Oh, we got this, babe.
Good job. Good job.

1:18:09.027 --> 1:18:11.017
You're doing really good.

1:18:11.019 --> 1:18:13.025
-Hello. How we doing?
-Hello.

1:18:13.027 --> 1:18:14.026
Okay. Yo, you could sell
this one, right?

1:18:14.028 --> 1:18:16.005
You know what I'm saying?

1:18:16.007 --> 1:18:17.025
-CARO: Yes!
-France and Germany, right?

1:18:17.027 --> 1:18:19.001
-Yeah?
-RAY: Yeah.

1:18:19.003 --> 1:18:20.017
All good.
They are the right flags,

1:18:20.019 --> 1:18:22.007
so, let's have a look.

1:18:22.009 --> 1:18:25.000
-CARO: He did really good.
-That is bang-on.

1:18:25.002 --> 1:18:26.005
-Hey! These are good.
-We did it, babe. Hey!

1:18:26.007 --> 1:18:27.017
-Okay, the other one?
-Germany, right?

1:18:31.013 --> 1:18:33.028
Yeah, you know what? Well done.

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.018
-Yay! Let's go!
-Yay! (whoops)

1:18:35.020 --> 1:18:37.008
Well, congratulations.

1:18:37.010 --> 1:18:39.006
-There's a clue.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

1:18:39.008 --> 1:18:40.012
All right, guys,
y'all got this.

1:18:40.014 --> 1:18:43.002
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

1:18:44.015 --> 1:18:46.005
SHERI:
Uh, cake check.

1:18:46.007 --> 1:18:48.007
-Hello.
-MAN: How are we doing?

1:18:48.009 --> 1:18:51.002
-Tell us something good.
-Oh, let's have a look.

1:18:51.004 --> 1:18:53.021
So we got France
and Germany, yeah?

1:18:53.023 --> 1:18:56.001
They are the right flags.

1:18:56.003 --> 1:18:57.008
-Yes.
-They're the right flags?

1:18:57.010 --> 1:19:00.018
Yeah, Germany looks really good.

1:19:00.020 --> 1:19:03.003
-Thank you. (mouths)
-Let's have a look at France.

1:19:04.005 --> 1:19:05.015
They seem to be...

1:19:06.029 --> 1:19:08.026
Yeah, you're good.
I'm happy with these two.

1:19:08.028 --> 1:19:10.021
-Oh!
-Let's go, baby.

1:19:10.023 --> 1:19:12.022
-Well, thank you so much.
-Well done. First try.

1:19:12.024 --> 1:19:14.007
Believe that's yours.

1:19:14.009 --> 1:19:16.001
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:19:18.011 --> 1:19:20.008
Okay, come on, Dad.

1:19:21.019 --> 1:19:24.018
-Come on up. Grab a seat.
-ARUN: Coming up. We are here.

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:26.019
Make yourself comfortable.

1:19:26.021 --> 1:19:29.007
-Boy, you had a good day
today, huh?
-We had a good day.

1:19:29.009 --> 1:19:32.000
KEOGHAN: Holly, let's get some
tea for these lovely people.

1:19:32.002 --> 1:19:33.024
SPENCER:
How much longer do you think
it's going to take?

1:19:38.026 --> 1:19:40.020
Yeah, I notice that.

1:19:41.022 --> 1:19:43.019
We got to hurry up.
It's down to us again.

1:19:43.021 --> 1:19:45.011
-Good job, baby.
-Thanks, boo.

1:19:45.013 --> 1:19:48.018
It is crunch time.
There's one more team here.

1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:51.009
-We're neck and neck.
-Come on, baby.
You got this. Check.

1:19:51.011 --> 1:19:53.003
Can we get a check?

1:19:53.005 --> 1:19:55.018
-(sighs)
-MAN: How are we doing?

1:19:55.020 --> 1:19:56.028
-We're doing good.
-Hopefully, good.

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.016
-Uh, France and Germany, yeah?
-BOTH: Yes.

1:19:58.018 --> 1:20:00.023
-Lovely. Right countries,
so we're good there.
-ISAIAH: Okay.

1:20:00.025 --> 1:20:04.002
Time to have a look at these.

1:20:04.004 --> 1:20:05.009
Yeah, really nice.

1:20:05.011 --> 1:20:08.012
And then in terms of France...

1:20:08.014 --> 1:20:10.025
Damn... Damn near perfect, boys.
Well done.

1:20:10.027 --> 1:20:12.025
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-(cheers)

1:20:12.027 --> 1:20:14.012
Oh, my gosh,
I love you so much.

1:20:14.014 --> 1:20:15.012
Oh, oh, hey, hey,
don't leave without this.

1:20:15.014 --> 1:20:16.014
Okay, thank you, thank you.

1:20:16.016 --> 1:20:17.024
-Well done, boys.
-Thank you so much.

1:20:19.027 --> 1:20:21.024
-RAQUEL: Is this it?
-CAYLA: Right, right?

1:20:23.001 --> 1:20:24.002
(exhales)

1:20:24.004 --> 1:20:26.008
KEOGHAN:
Come on up, guys, grab a seat.

1:20:26.010 --> 1:20:27.015
-Okay.
-There we are.

1:20:27.017 --> 1:20:29.003
-Beautiful, beautiful.
-Oh, is that coffee?

1:20:29.005 --> 1:20:30.014
Cup of tea.

1:20:30.016 --> 1:20:31.018
-It's very English.
-We just said

1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:33.000
this is the first time
in a long time

1:20:33.002 --> 1:20:34.005
that we did not start the day
with warm coffee or tea.

1:20:34.007 --> 1:20:35.014
Oh, wait, this is actually...
oh, this is so nice.

1:20:35.016 --> 1:20:36.010
Cheers. Where's yours?

1:20:37.017 --> 1:20:40.006
Before leaving here,
I broke up with my ex,

1:20:40.008 --> 1:20:41.010
and he told me I wasn't gonna...

1:20:42.016 --> 1:20:45.014
...make it, and that's exactly
what's happening.

1:20:45.016 --> 1:20:48.015
So I have that negativity
right now in-in my head.

1:20:48.017 --> 1:20:50.015
He was right.

1:20:50.017 --> 1:20:52.019
You're gonna let
some ass tell you that?

1:20:52.021 --> 1:20:54.011
What-what the ... is he doing?

1:20:54.013 --> 1:20:56.008
You need to just let go of that.

1:20:56.010 --> 1:20:57.018
That's the problem.

1:20:57.020 --> 1:20:58.010
You don't know how to let go.

1:20:58.012 --> 1:20:59.025
He's a loser.

1:20:59.027 --> 1:21:02.005
I don't want to talk about it,
so drop it.

1:21:02.007 --> 1:21:03.025
-And you're worried
over this ass that has nothing?
-I'm not worried.

1:21:03.027 --> 1:21:06.013
Lala, I said drop it...
(speaks Spanish)

1:21:06.015 --> 1:21:08.001
Can we get a check?

1:21:08.003 --> 1:21:09.028
-Hi.
-MAN: How did we do?

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.009
Let's have a look.

1:21:11.011 --> 1:21:12.017
Thank you. So...

1:21:12.019 --> 1:21:14.017
right countries, so very good.

1:21:14.019 --> 1:21:15.017
First off the bat,

1:21:15.019 --> 1:21:17.011
we got nice summer berries.

1:21:17.013 --> 1:21:19.002
(hums)

1:21:19.004 --> 1:21:20.010
Nice.

1:21:20.012 --> 1:21:22.001
Yep, good on both.

1:21:22.003 --> 1:21:23.004
I'm happy with that.

1:21:23.006 --> 1:21:24.001
-Thank you.
-Well done. Well done.

1:21:24.003 --> 1:21:25.022
-(laughs)
-Thank you so much.

1:21:25.024 --> 1:21:27.005
-Congratulations.
-BOTH: Thank you.

1:21:27.007 --> 1:21:28.024
(laughs)

1:21:30.003 --> 1:21:32.000
-Hi.
-Hi, do you know

1:21:30.003 --> 1:21:32.000
where this place is?

1:21:33.012 --> 1:21:34.020
Why are you crying?

1:21:34.022 --> 1:21:36.000
Because I'm mad at you.

1:21:36.002 --> 1:21:37.024
-What did I do?
-What you said.

1:21:37.026 --> 1:21:39.001
What did I say?

1:21:39.003 --> 1:21:41.029
That you-you had the-the words
of your ex,

1:21:42.001 --> 1:21:44.017
that you-you're never,
you're never gonna do it.

1:21:44.019 --> 1:21:47.008
-I was just simply expressing
what I felt.
-No, but let me say it.

1:21:47.010 --> 1:21:50.028
I said one thing that I felt
like I wanted to say and share,

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.007
and you're giving me
a hard time over it.

1:21:53.009 --> 1:21:55.017
My intention was not
to make you feel like crap.

1:21:55.019 --> 1:21:58.015
-But you did.
-My intention was
to open your eyes finally.

1:21:58.017 --> 1:22:00.010
-I am!
-Let me finish.

1:22:00.012 --> 1:22:01.022
LULU:
I said one thing!

1:22:01.024 --> 1:22:03.015
You're not trying
to see my point.

1:22:03.017 --> 1:22:05.003
You're right, I'm not.

1:22:05.005 --> 1:22:07.016
Shame on me
for trying to be a good sister.

1:22:15.017 --> 1:22:17.015
I finally do that, and you're
holding it up against me.

1:22:17.017 --> 1:22:18.022
I'm not holding it up
against you.

1:22:18.024 --> 1:22:19.023
Like, I can't hold this ...
in anymore.

1:22:19.025 --> 1:22:20.029
I'm not holding it up
against you...

1:22:21.001 --> 1:22:22.013
So, why...?
Let me talk about it then.

1:22:22.015 --> 1:22:24.004
-Okay, then...
-So-so, then...

1:22:24.006 --> 1:22:25.006
There was no need for it,

1:22:25.008 --> 1:22:26.018
because it didn't help us
at all.

1:22:26.020 --> 1:22:27.010
-It didn't. We just...
-If anything,

1:22:27.012 --> 1:22:28.016
it just ruined the day,

1:22:28.018 --> 1:22:29.019
'cause I really
couldn't stand her.

1:22:29.021 --> 1:22:31.000
I wanted to strangle her.

1:22:32.025 --> 1:22:34.015
We're just gonna
leave it behind us,

1:22:34.017 --> 1:22:36.015
-and we're not gonna
do that ever again.
-Yeah.

1:22:36.017 --> 1:22:37.024
I was just trying
to defend you.

1:22:37.026 --> 1:22:38.026
You didn't say sorry,
but I forgive you.

1:22:38.028 --> 1:22:41.000
-(clenched): Sorry.
-I'll take it.

1:22:45.018 --> 1:22:47.005
Are these the other guys?

1:22:47.007 --> 1:22:48.018
Yeah.

1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:49.028
ANTHONY:
The light blue team.

1:22:51.006 --> 1:22:52.023
We just went
two different directions.

1:22:54.001 --> 1:22:56.027
-We did?
-They went up there,
and we went down here.

1:22:56.029 --> 1:22:58.013
This is gonna, this is gonna
make the difference.

1:22:59.029 --> 1:23:01.019
PENN:
Our guy's crushing it.

1:23:01.021 --> 1:23:02.017
KIM:
Yeah, he is.

1:23:03.026 --> 1:23:05.026
And here we are
at the red light.

1:23:05.028 --> 1:23:06.025
(chuckles)

1:23:06.027 --> 1:23:08.012
(sighs)

1:23:10.024 --> 1:23:12.002
Filming you being
an awesome cab driver.

1:23:13.008 --> 1:23:14.002
CARO:
All right, thank you.

1:23:15.008 --> 1:23:16.011
ANTHONY:
Thank you.

1:23:16.013 --> 1:23:17.014
All right, let's roll.

1:23:18.028 --> 1:23:20.006
-You go in first.
-I know.

1:23:20.008 --> 1:23:21.012
CARO:
Let's go.

1:23:23.006 --> 1:23:24.021
Hi, guys.

1:23:24.023 --> 1:23:25.022
-PENN: Dude.
-Hi, Phil.

1:23:25.024 --> 1:23:26.027
Come and grab a seat.

1:23:26.029 --> 1:23:28.012
Make yourself comfortable.

1:23:28.014 --> 1:23:29.007
RAY:
Yeah, come on.

1:23:29.009 --> 1:23:30.027
Hey.

1:23:30.029 --> 1:23:31.022
-Come on, guys.
-What's up?
-Oh, my gosh.

1:23:31.024 --> 1:23:33.027
What up, what up, what up,
my guy?

1:23:33.029 --> 1:23:35.010
-Hello.
-Hey, guys.
-Just grab a seat.

1:23:35.012 --> 1:23:37.007
Not as good as yesterday, but...

1:23:37.009 --> 1:23:38.025
-We're racing.
-We're still here, so...

1:23:38.027 --> 1:23:40.022
-Don't you give up on me now.
-Phil.

1:23:40.024 --> 1:23:42.014
-Have a seat right here.
-Oh.

1:23:43.014 --> 1:23:45.016
Good to know we're not in last,

1:23:45.018 --> 1:23:47.003
but any-anything can happen,
so it doesn't feel that great.

1:23:47.005 --> 1:23:48.005
There's no cushion,

1:23:48.007 --> 1:23:50.021
you know,
if we make any wrong move.

1:23:50.023 --> 1:23:52.023
Uh, and then we might
run into some traffic.

1:23:52.025 --> 1:23:54.021
LULU: We are racing
for a million dollars,

1:23:54.023 --> 1:23:56.015
so if you can burn rubber,
we'd appreciate it.

1:23:58.002 --> 1:23:59.004
Thank you.

1:24:00.011 --> 1:24:03.020
Uh, how far do you think we are
away from the destination?

1:24:06.023 --> 1:24:08.022
ISAIAH:
Oh, Lord.

1:24:08.024 --> 1:24:09.029
Oh, gosh.

1:24:10.001 --> 1:24:12.018
What will Phil tell us?

1:24:15.011 --> 1:24:17.004
-Ooh.
-(horns honking)

1:24:17.006 --> 1:24:18.023
This is not good.

1:24:18.025 --> 1:24:20.023
TAYLOR:
This is, like,
almost standstill.

1:24:20.025 --> 1:24:23.008
We can sit here and wait, and...

1:24:23.010 --> 1:24:24.008
Hope for the best.

1:24:24.010 --> 1:24:25.021
Are we almost near?

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.006
Okay, cool.
Maybe like five-ten minutes?

1:24:37.002 --> 1:24:39.004
(panting)

1:24:41.014 --> 1:24:42.024
-Grab a seat, you guys.
-Hey, Phil.

1:24:42.026 --> 1:24:44.022
-Hey, Phil.
-Hey there.

1:24:44.024 --> 1:24:46.009
-KEOGHAN: You're
team number nine.
-(Taylor whoops)

1:24:46.011 --> 1:24:47.009
-KEOGHAN: Sound good?
-ISAIAH: Thank you so much.

1:24:47.011 --> 1:24:47.022
-Yeah, sounds good.
-TAYLOR: Yeah!

1:24:49.005 --> 1:24:50.006
-All right.
-This way, Lala.

1:24:52.002 --> 1:24:53.017
Ah.

1:24:53.019 --> 1:24:55.020
What up, Phil?

1:24:55.022 --> 1:24:58.013
Lulu and Lala,
come and have a seat.

1:24:58.015 --> 1:25:00.017
Would it be fair
to say you've had a tough day?

1:25:00.019 --> 1:25:01.017
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:25:01.019 --> 1:25:03.005
You know what my mom always says

1:25:03.007 --> 1:25:04.009
when you've had a tough day?

1:25:04.011 --> 1:25:06.003
"Have a cup of tea."

1:25:06.005 --> 1:25:07.028
-Let's have a cup of tea.
-Cup of tea.

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.024
Holly, would you mind
pouring a cup of tea

1:25:09.026 --> 1:25:11.013
-for these lovely young women?
-That would actually be
very nice.

1:25:11.015 --> 1:25:12.020
Here we are.

1:25:12.022 --> 1:25:14.013
So, have you still
had a good time?

1:25:14.015 --> 1:25:17.004
-I've had the best time
of my life, Phil.
-The-the best time.

1:25:17.006 --> 1:25:19.009
-Uh, the-the city of London
is beautiful.
-Yeah. Beautiful.

1:25:19.011 --> 1:25:20.023
But you know you're last?

1:25:20.025 --> 1:25:22.009
-Yes, we know.
-Yes, we're last.

1:25:22.011 --> 1:25:24.000
-So, here's the crazy thing.
-BOTH: Yeah?

1:25:24.002 --> 1:25:25.009
You're actually still racing.

1:25:25.011 --> 1:25:26.015
-What?!
-What?!

1:25:26.017 --> 1:25:28.006
In our head, we're like,
"Well, it was nice."

1:25:28.008 --> 1:25:29.016
I have another clue for you.

1:25:29.018 --> 1:25:31.000
(both scream)

1:25:31.002 --> 1:25:32.013
That got our energy

1:25:32.015 --> 1:25:33.024
to a whole other...

1:25:33.026 --> 1:25:35.004
It was the second wind
we needed.

1:25:35.006 --> 1:25:36.025
-You have a train to catch.
-Mm-hmm.

1:25:36.027 --> 1:25:38.015
-And you have some racing to do.
-Yes, we do.
-We do.

1:25:38.017 --> 1:25:40.007
You could still win this race.

1:25:40.009 --> 1:25:41.015
All right, see you in Scotland.

1:25:41.017 --> 1:25:42.007
-Okay.
-All right.

1:25:42.009 --> 1:25:43.015
All right. Be safe.

1:25:43.017 --> 1:25:44.025
-(laughter)
-Oh, God.

1:25:44.027 --> 1:25:46.020
Oh, my God.
We're still in the race.

1:25:46.022 --> 1:25:49.011
-We're still in it.
We're still in the race.
-We're still in the race.

1:25:49.013 --> 1:25:51.024
KEOGHAN: Next time
on The Amazing Race...

1:25:51.026 --> 1:25:54.021
The race continues
in Glasgow, Scotland.

1:25:54.023 --> 1:25:57.005
It is manual transmission.

1:25:57.007 --> 1:25:59.009
-(horns honking)
-CONNIE: Go, baby.
-I got it.

1:25:59.011 --> 1:26:00.022
AKBAR: This is, like,
a new driver's worst nightmare,

1:26:00.024 --> 1:26:02.022
to be in stop-and-go traffic.

1:26:02.024 --> 1:26:04.029
-(engine straining)
-CARO: I just want to stay safe.

1:26:06.008 --> 1:26:09.002
KEOGHAN: And an unprecedented
first for the race.

1:26:09.004 --> 1:26:12.006
Right now, the world
is dealing with the coronavirus.

1:26:12.008 --> 1:26:13.021
In order to keep you safe,

1:26:13.023 --> 1:26:16.010
the best choice
is to suspend the race.
