You fell,
injured your ankles.

Uh, Dr. Lieu, doors.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.193
Some, uh--
some sort of memory loop?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.487
Maybe a whiplash injury,
concussion?

08:07.529 --> 08:09.489
- I literally caught him
when he hit the ground.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.491
He didn't hit his head.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.284
The summit bell.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.161
He kept ringing it.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.414
Same sort of loop
like he's doing now.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.998
But it was before the fall.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.500
- All right,
first things first.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.835
Let's reduce his dislocation.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.003
Soon as that's done,

08:23.044 --> 08:25.171
let's pull in Dr. Charles,
okay?

08:27.298 --> 08:29.134

I've never officially

08:29.175 --> 08:30.844

with endometriosis.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.721
- Yeah, I noticed that
in your chart.

- [sighs]
My sister, though, she has it.

About to start my period.
Maybe that's why.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.202
- All right, well,
I'd like to run some tests,

08:56.244 --> 08:58.288
do a bimanual exam,
then an ultrasound.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.832
- Sure. Yeah, anything.
I just want to feel better.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.461
Do you think I could
get something now, though?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.839
For the pain?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.257
How about Tylenol?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.509
- Okay.
If you think it'll help.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.891
- 1,000 milligrams
acetaminophen.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.768
- That's it?
For this degree of pain?

09:19.809 --> 09:22.187
- Yeah, I want to hold off
on anything stronger for now.

Okay.

you're going to five.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.570
Cesar, talk to me.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.114
- Aaron Curtis, 22.
Severe abdominal pain.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.908
He doubled over at work
while stocking shelves.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.452
BP 133/86.
Heart rate 99.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.787
Sats 100%.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.205
2 of morphine given
in the ambo.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.664
All this ain't necessary.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.167
- Maybe, but you're here now,
so let us check you out.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.418
[sighs]

09:45.460 --> 09:48.630
- Okay, on my count.
One, two, three.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.256
[groans]

09:50.298 --> 09:51.883
Thank you.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.969
- Look, my manager
at the grocery store,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.262
that's who called
the ambulance.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.890
He's just overreacting.
That's all.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.101
- Sorry we can't
take your word for it.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.562
- Hey, Aaron,
your stomach pain,

10:04.604 --> 10:07.649
did it just start this morning,
or you been feeling it a while?

10:07.691 --> 10:09.109
- I don't know.
Couple days.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.444
Can you describe it?

10:11.486 --> 10:14.030
Dull? Sharp? In between?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.783
Aah!

10:16.825 --> 10:18.451
- Ooh.
- Okay. Sharp.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.828
KUB.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.705
We're gonna grab some X-rays,
see what's going on.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.998
- I know it's uncomfortable,
but stay still, okay, Aaron?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.210
Please...

10:27.252 --> 10:29.254
just let me up out of here.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.970
- X-ray up. Clear.
[machine beeps]

10:38.638 --> 10:40.682
That's a bullet, Aaron.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.183
You were shot?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.645
Okay, let's turn him.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.730
Nice and easy.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.316
[groaning]

10:50.358 --> 10:52.152
There you are.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.779
Partially healed entry wound
in the left flank.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.823
I'd guess it's a few days old.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.491
What happened, Aaron?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.829
Aaron?

11:02.871 --> 11:04.414
Triple contrast CT.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.833
Maybe it'll tell us something.

11:06.875 --> 11:13.006
<i>* *</i>

11:20.597 --> 11:20.764
.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.931
- Were you able
to get anything out of him?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.350
Nope.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.726
He won't share the what, when,

11:24.768 --> 11:26.811
or why of his gunshot.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.813
- Yeah,
something sketchy went down.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.902
So, Aaron,
here's where we are, okay?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.236
The bullet is resting

11:35.278 --> 11:38.239
just above the neck
of your pancreas.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.033
Do I need an operation?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.243
- Trauma surgeon
doesn't think so.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.162
Then I could bounce?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.955
- The pancreas
is very unforgiving.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.082
Just because you're stable now

11:47.123 --> 11:48.500
doesn't mean
you're out of the woods.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.587
There's one more thing.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.758
By law, gunshot wounds have
to be reported to the police.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.302
Aaron...

12:01.596 --> 12:04.140
If you're in trouble,
maybe we can help you.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.602
You just gotta talk to us.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.194
- It doesn't matter
what I say.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.781

12:21.574 --> 12:22.659
Hmm.

Vegan portabella

12:25.203 --> 12:26.913
Yeah, low in sodium.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.581

- Mm.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.417
- Your kidneys thank you.
- Huh.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.668
Well, they better.
What's up?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.086
Ah, OpioHealth,

12:33.128 --> 12:35.296
that new AI program
that the hospital's testing out

12:35.338 --> 12:37.549
to assess a patient's risk
of opioid abuse?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.925
- Yeah, it's one
of those new technologies

12:38.967 --> 12:41.011
designed to sniff out
doctor shoppers, yeah?

12:41.052 --> 12:44.139
- Yeah, well, I ran
my endometriosis patient's name

12:44.180 --> 12:45.765
through it, Jodie Dunner.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.891
She was red-flagged.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.810
Well, I can see why.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.604
That's a lengthy
prescription history.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.649
Opioids, benzos, barbiturates.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.818
Yeah, reads like
a classic pill-seeker.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.903
- And given that her primary
complaint was back pain,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.156
I thought so too.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.699
But now, I'm not so sure.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.243
- Uh, okay.
What do you need?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.661
Second opinion.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.164
The AI program tagged her
as high-risk.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.540
That means if it is endo,

13:10.582 --> 13:12.959
I'm locked out
of prescribing her meds, but...

13:13.001 --> 13:14.085
As chief of the ED,

13:14.127 --> 13:15.795
I can override
the OpioHealth program.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.005
[sighing] Yes.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.674
Dean, you know my past.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.886
It takes one to know one,
but Jodie...

13:22.927 --> 13:25.722
I'm just not getting
that vibe from her.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.890
Mm.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.353
[chuckles]

13:33.313 --> 13:34.898
Maggie?

13:38.276 --> 13:40.487
Maggie.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.697
- Oh, I'm sorry.
What do you need?

13:42.739 --> 13:45.658
- Treatment seven is cleared
and turned over.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.951
Everything good?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.578
Yeah, of course.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.330
Okay.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.290
Hey, they're done.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.542
[indistinct conversation]

13:54.584 --> 13:56.795
So he, uh,
tell you what happened?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.964
- No, he probably doesn't want
to dig his hole any deeper.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.758
And what does that mean?

14:01.800 --> 14:04.469
- Area South Robbery-Homicide's
working a case off 91st

14:04.511 --> 14:05.679
from last week.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.013
Mini-mart got stuck up.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.099
Clerk pulled a gun,
tried to protect himself.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.350
Took one to the chest.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.518
Didn't make it.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.686
- And you think
Aaron's your guy?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.896
- The description
we got on the offender:

14:14.938 --> 14:18.858
male, Black, average height,
medium build, hoodie.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.194
Clerk fired off a round
before he went down.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.155
Separate blood on the scene
shows he hit someone.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.741
- Detective working the case
is on his way over.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.868
We're gonna sit on the room
until he gets here.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.371
- All right.
Thanks, guys.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.998
Be advised...

14:34.040 --> 14:36.042
- I know these guys are
just chasing leads, but...

14:36.084 --> 14:39.295
- Male, Black,
average height, medium build?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.047
That could be
a lot of people, Will.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.675
- Yeah, and getting shot
doesn't mean you're a criminal.

14:43.717 --> 14:48.346
- I mean, the way that Aaron
took my hand at the intake,

14:48.388 --> 14:51.266
the way he looked
into my eyes...

14:51.307 --> 14:52.809
I felt it too.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.062
- I mean, I don't know
if he did it or not...

14:56.104 --> 14:59.024
but I'm certain that they've
already made up their minds.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.527
<i>* *</i>

15:02.569 --> 15:03.820
- S...
[sighs]

15:03.862 --> 15:07.407
So I fell while I was climbing.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.452
I dislocated both my ankles,

15:10.493 --> 15:12.912
and they're set now.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.456
And that's
what these casts are for.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.458
Exactly.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.752
And we were talking
about next steps.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.628
- Can you remember what we said?
- Right.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.090
Yeah, you said--
you said that...

15:24.132 --> 15:26.593
You said--
[sighs]

15:26.634 --> 15:27.969
Damn it!

15:29.137 --> 15:30.472
Omar, you had a big fall.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.640
- It's not okay.
Why can't I remember?

15:32.682 --> 15:35.018
What--what is happening to me?

15:35.060 --> 15:36.686
Um, Omar,

15:36.728 --> 15:38.772
your--your blood pressure
is getting a little high,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.482
so we're gonna give you some
medicine to bring it back down.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.067
Just breathe in
through your nose.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.401
[inhales deeply]

15:43.443 --> 15:44.611
- Out through the mouth.
- [exhales deeply]

15:44.652 --> 15:45.653
[beeping regulates]

15:45.695 --> 15:48.073
In through the nose...

15:48.114 --> 15:49.366
and out through the mouth.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.785
Okay.
You know what, buddy?

15:51.826 --> 15:53.203
I'm gonna let you
rest a little bit,

15:53.244 --> 15:54.621
but I want you to be assured

15:54.662 --> 15:56.373
we're gonna figure this out.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.832
Uh, in the meantime,

15:57.874 --> 15:59.292
can I get you another sandwich?

15:59.334 --> 16:00.543
You kind of mangled that one.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.797
No? All right.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.882
I will, uh,
check back in a bit.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.180
Clearly, he's got some kind
of short-term memory issue,

16:12.222 --> 16:15.475
uh, which is understandably
stressing him out a little bit.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.976
I mean, you know Omar, right?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.603
Can you tell me
a little bit about him?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
- He's only been climbing
a few years,

16:20.522 --> 16:21.856
but he's a star at the gym.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.442
He trains hard.
Disciplined. Driven.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.444
- All right.
So more of a type A?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.822
- You thinking
he had a mental break

16:28.863 --> 16:30.407
from pushing himself too hard?

16:30.448 --> 16:31.991
- Well, memory loss
can be a result

16:32.033 --> 16:34.160
of a number
of psychiatric conditions,

16:34.202 --> 16:36.371
but it can also be neurologic.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.497
You know what I want to do?

16:37.539 --> 16:38.873
I want to get
a nutrition panel.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.126
- See what we get, go from there?
- Okay.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.919
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.383
- Any discomfort?
- Kind of.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.551
Mm?

16:49.592 --> 16:51.094
Can you be more specific?

16:51.136 --> 16:52.721
How does this feel?

16:52.762 --> 16:57.642
Um, I guess pressure.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.562
- Pressure, like
I'm pressing on your abdomen?

17:00.603 --> 17:03.231
- Yeah. Sorry.
It's just hard to describe.

17:03.273 --> 17:07.068
- Okay. Pressing farther up
now, near your diaphragm.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.570
How does this feel?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.906
Same, I guess.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.242
Okay.

17:14.284 --> 17:17.245
Not sharp, stabbing?

17:17.287 --> 17:20.749
No, just...like pressure.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.043
- Okay, Jodie, I don't think
this is endometriosis.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.669
But to be sure,
I'm gonna run some tests.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.589
CT, MRI, diagnostic lap.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.090
Lap? What's that?

17:29.132 --> 17:30.383
Uh, laparoscopy.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.302
We insert a scope
into your abdomen,

17:32.344 --> 17:33.845
check out what's going on.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.638
- Surgery?
- Yeah.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.890
And unfortunately,
we won't be able

17:36.931 --> 17:38.892
to give you pain meds
beforehand,

17:38.933 --> 17:40.518
'cause it might interfere
with the results.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.854
Okay. I get it.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.816
Hey, it'll be all right.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.490
- Uh,
pupils practically pinpoint.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.949
Overall listlessness.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.826
Yeah, all signs she's high.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.287
Her tox screen was likely
a false negative.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.456
She probably loaded up on water
before coming in,

18:01.498 --> 18:02.791
knew it could dilute
her urine sample.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.542
- Yeah, doubt she saw
a mountain of tests

18:04.584 --> 18:05.835
coming her way,
and I didn't get the sense

18:05.877 --> 18:07.003
that she knew
that they were phony.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.130
No, my guess is that right now,

18:09.172 --> 18:10.548
she's planning her escape

18:10.590 --> 18:13.009
before any social workers
become involved.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.470
I believed her,

18:15.512 --> 18:19.724
or I don't know, maybe
I just wanted to believe her.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.311

Jodie was in pain, okay?

18:23.353 --> 18:26.022
You didn't care what kind.
You just wanted to help.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.175
- BP's a mess.
88/50 and falling.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.260
Roll him.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.511
Huge melanotic stool.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.097
He's bleeding
into his GI tract.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.057
Two units of blood
on the rapid transfuser.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.392
Already on it.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.768
Watch your step.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.645
All right, we're moving.
CT. Let's go.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.774
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

19:15.238 --> 19:15.447
.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.364
- You said
I didn't need surgery.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.241
Well, that was before.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.784
Your condition
has deteriorated.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.119
The bullet has eroded

19:21.161 --> 19:24.414
into the, uh,
the neck of the pancreas.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.374
That means
it's touching the organ,

19:26.416 --> 19:29.544
making it bleed into the tube
that drains your intestines.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.754
It won't stop on its own?

19:30.795 --> 19:33.757
It may...or it may not.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.509
The safest option is to go in,
take out the bullet,

19:36.551 --> 19:38.845
and remove the damaged area
of the pancreas.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.848
No. No surgery. No.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.977
- Look, Aaron, your, uh,
blood pressure's unstable.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.312
You've lost a lot of blood.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.148
Opening me up means
he gets the bullet.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.317
I know how it works.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.070
He gonna use it
to tie me to the robbery.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.280
- Are you saying
that you were there?

19:58.490 --> 20:01.701
- I was there,
but I didn't rob nobody.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.537
Definitely didn't shoot nobody.

20:04.579 --> 20:08.333
I was getting a sandwich
on my way to work.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.128
Went to the counter to pay,
and next thing I know,

20:12.170 --> 20:14.506
a guy's jacking the place.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.341
I mean, he got a gun.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.510
Clerk got a gun.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.886
They firing.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.846
I ran.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.557
I felt getting hit, but...

20:24.599 --> 20:25.558
I just kept running.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.020
It's been a week, though.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.522
Why didn't you come forward,

20:30.563 --> 20:33.566
tell the police, us,
when you first came in?

20:33.608 --> 20:37.153
- Because trust
has to go both ways.

20:39.406 --> 20:44.160
- Look, I grew up bouncing
house to house in foster care.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.037
Spent time living
on the street too.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.500
People like me...

20:50.542 --> 20:53.044
it don't matter
what really happened.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.504
We gonna get blamed for it.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.842
I ain't the guy.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.219
I swear.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.389
- Look, Aaron,
your pancreas is bleeding,

21:04.431 --> 21:07.392
and without surgery,
your life could be at stake.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.854
- And if I get it,
my life could be over.

21:10.895 --> 21:15.066
I seen people get convicted
and sent away forever.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.027
They were innocent too.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.115
I'm gonna take my chance
the bleeding stops on its own

21:22.157 --> 21:25.118
rather than put my fate
in his hands.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.996
No surgery.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.251
Okay.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.878
[monitor beeping rapidly]

21:34.919 --> 21:36.755
She's seizing.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.715
4 milligrams of Ativan.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.258
Naloxone on standby.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.926
- Overdose?
- It looks like it.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.303
- Thought you had eyes on her.
- I did.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.180
I was watching her like a hawk
so she couldn't bolt

21:45.221 --> 21:46.431
before the addiction counselor
came down.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.932
- So she hasn't used
at all recently?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.142
Not a chance.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.355
- [beeping regulates]
- Okay.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.940
So if not an OD,
maybe withdrawal?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.317
Yeah, doubt it.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.778
She's missing
all the telltale symptoms.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.698
Agitation, runny nose,
watery eyes, dilated pupils.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.742
- Well, endometriosis
doesn't trigger seizures.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.952
So if not an OD
and not withdrawal, what is it?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.537
- Let's get a CT
head and chest,

22:09.579 --> 22:10.538
this time for real.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.418
- Hey, so I, uh--

22:15.460 --> 22:17.921
I got Omar's
nutrition panel back.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.881
Serious B1 deficiency.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.299
Body can't generate B1.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.842
We only get it from food.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.345
This low a level means
Omar's not eating enough.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.431
- Probably been malnourished
for a while now.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.724
- Eating disorders
aren't uncommon

22:29.766 --> 22:31.810
- in the rock climbing community.
- Really?

22:31.851 --> 22:34.145
- You're fighting gravity
with only fingertips and toes,

22:34.187 --> 22:35.605
so lighter's better.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.483
- Uh, what do you say
we hang some IV nutrients?

22:38.525 --> 22:40.652
Those memory issues
should resolve pretty quick.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.494
[phone buzzing]

22:53.623 --> 22:56.418
Will, he's here.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.215
- Thanks for coming.
- Uh-huh.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.176
So I, uh, looked
at the security video

23:05.218 --> 23:06.845
- from the mini-mart.
- Yeah.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.013
Crap footage and bad angles.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.055
You can tell
something's going on,

23:09.097 --> 23:10.181
but you don't know
who's doing what.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.266
Eyewitness statements?

23:11.307 --> 23:12.517
All over the place.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.394
- So no proof
that Aaron's the offender,

23:14.436 --> 23:15.895
but no proof
that he's not either.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.605
No. I spoke with the manager

23:17.647 --> 23:19.691
at the grocery store
where he stocks shelves.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.943
Said he always comes in early.
Leaves late.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.695
"Aaron's a great guy.
Wish I had more like him."

23:23.737 --> 23:24.696
His words.

23:24.738 --> 23:26.531
- He ever been
in trouble before?

23:26.573 --> 23:27.949
- No run-ins with the police.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.284
No criminal record.
No contact card.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.493
No gang affiliation.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.370
So what do you think, Kevin?

23:32.412 --> 23:35.623
- Uh, I mean,
it's not my case, Maggie.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.042
- Hey, look,
I know we're asking you

23:37.083 --> 23:39.252
to speak out of turn, but
Aaron's passing on a surgery

23:39.294 --> 23:41.504
he desperately needs over this.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.340
- Well, you know,
I like to say

23:43.381 --> 23:45.884
that there's always a why
before there's a who.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.927
There is no why
for Aaron in this robbery.

23:47.969 --> 23:51.056
I mean, I don't believe
that he's good for it,

23:51.097 --> 23:52.307
but that's the way I see it.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.142
I mean,
the state's attorney is hungry.

23:54.184 --> 23:57.395
With an election coming up,
he might see it differently.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.230
- Right.
- All right. Thanks, man.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.024
- Yeah.
I'll be here if you need me.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.567
- Good seeing you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.571
- So, Jodie,
we've got an answer.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.739
Okay.

24:07.781 --> 24:10.075
- Your back pain
is not from endometriosis.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.827
It is from a Pancoast tumor.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.163
- Whoa. A tumor?
- Yes.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.916
It's a rare lung cancer.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.877
Your body's response to it
caused pinpoint pupils

24:20.919 --> 24:23.296
and ultimately your seizure.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.509
So it's right here.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.929
- Oh, God.
That's in me?

24:30.970 --> 24:34.599
- It is, but it doesn't appear
to have metastasized.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.184
Do you know what that means,
metastasized?

24:36.226 --> 24:40.438
Um...I'm not sure.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.399
- It means
that the cancer hasn't spread.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.067
- So it'll make it
easier to treat.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.777
The tumor can be removed
surgically.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.987
It's called resection.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.948
Do you understand?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.617
I...

24:52.659 --> 24:55.161
I think so.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.872
- Okay, Jodie, Dr. Archer and I
are gonna step outside.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.207
We'll be right back, okay?

25:03.837 --> 25:06.381
That was not
an informed consent.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.091
Postictal confusion
from the seizure?

25:08.133 --> 25:09.217
- Could be,
or it could be

25:09.259 --> 25:11.344
another complication
from the tumor.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.847
There were some glimmers
of recognition, though.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.599
- Yeah. I'll call psych,
get their take.

25:16.641 --> 25:17.726
Okay.

25:24.649 --> 25:24.858
.

25:24.899 --> 25:25.316
65, 58, 51.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.655
- Keep going?
- No, it's good stuff.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.323
How about
that word sequence I gave you?

25:32.365 --> 25:33.742
Let's give that a shot.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.952
Um, San Antonio.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.829
Bubblegum.

25:37.871 --> 25:41.624
- Shoelace, ice skate, stapler.
- Excellent.

25:41.666 --> 25:45.003
Well, looks like your memory's
certainly coming back.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.588
- Justin, man...
[sighs]

25:46.629 --> 25:49.132
I'm sorry for putting you
through all this.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.676
I have a tendency
to overdo things.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.928
- Actually, wondering if we
could talk to you about that.

25:53.970 --> 25:57.057
Maybe discuss
your eating habits.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.224
Oh, yeah.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.268
I can see how that looks now.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.604
[sighs]

26:02.645 --> 26:05.398
Right after the world shut down
'cause of COVID,

26:05.440 --> 26:07.192
I started getting
these headaches.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.693
And I read online

26:08.735 --> 26:11.363
if you drink two pints of beer
a day, it helps,

26:11.404 --> 26:14.908
so I started drinking
two pints a day.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.952
But it didn't work,
so I added exercise.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.996
Rock climbing was perfect,
'cause it was--

26:20.038 --> 26:23.375
it was outside,
socially distant, challenging,

26:23.416 --> 26:24.501
but now I was...

26:24.542 --> 26:25.919
I was sporting this beer belly,

26:25.960 --> 26:28.254
so I--I started dieting.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.756
- And I noticed that you--

26:29.798 --> 26:32.092
you only ate
the--the tomato and the lettuce

26:32.133 --> 26:35.095
out of your sandwich,
so I'm assuming vegetarian?

26:35.136 --> 26:37.097
Uh, and keto.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.765
- And keto?
- Yeah.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.433
Wow, okay.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.268
So you mentioned that this--

26:42.310 --> 26:44.062
this all started
with headaches, right?

26:44.104 --> 26:45.188
Are you still getting those?

26:45.230 --> 26:46.981
Actually, uh, yeah.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.608
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.776
I want you
to do something for me.

26:49.818 --> 26:52.570
I want you
to look at my finger.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.322
Follow my finger
with just your eyes,

26:54.364 --> 26:56.241
without moving your head, okay?

26:56.282 --> 26:57.450
- Mm-hmm.

27:01.913 --> 27:04.666
- What the hell?
I--I can't move my eyes.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.376
- It's okay.
- No, I can't move my eyes.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.003
- No, it's all right.
Just close 'em.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.713
- [stammering]
No, but what's wrong?

27:09.754 --> 27:11.131
- I can't move my eyes!
- Close your eyes, all right?

27:11.172 --> 27:12.298
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.466
Okay, order an MRI.

27:13.508 --> 27:15.677
I'm scared.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.721
Oh, I'm--I'm--
I'm really scared.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.431
- It's all right, Omar.
Keep 'em closed, all right?

27:19.472 --> 27:21.349
Keep 'em closed.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.109
- Any progress?
- No.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.652
- Well, we'll just have
to keep hanging blood

27:32.694 --> 27:34.904
and hope for the best.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.281
Dr. Halstead.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.574
Ms. Lockwood.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.492
We've positively matched blood

27:39.534 --> 27:42.120
from pads discarded
in Aaron's treatment room

27:42.162 --> 27:43.246
to blood at the crime scene.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.956
Pads?

27:44.998 --> 27:46.624
The melanotic stool.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.501
We rushed him to CT.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.211
Anything tossed on the floor
is detritus,

27:50.253 --> 27:51.463
fair game for evidence.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.256
- Blood links Aaron
to the crime scene,

27:53.298 --> 27:55.884
and that bullet inside him
is gonna link him to the clerk.

27:55.925 --> 27:59.095
- Which only proves
that the clerk shot Aaron,

27:59.137 --> 28:00.680
not that he's the offender.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.766
- That isn't
my distinction to make.

28:02.807 --> 28:06.686
It's my understanding
that Aaron requires surgery.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.855
This is a warrant for
the bullet once it's removed.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.774
- You're out of luck.
He declined the procedure.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.692
And by law, the state
can't force him to have it.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.070
True, but Aaron's a minor.

28:15.111 --> 28:18.406
ID he's been using to get
a job, rent an apartment,

28:18.448 --> 28:19.532
it's fake.

28:19.574 --> 28:20.825
Turns out, a few months ago,

28:20.867 --> 28:22.243
he ran away
from his latest foster family.

28:22.285 --> 28:25.789
Been pretending to be of age
to cover his trail.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.416
Aaron's DCFS paperwork.

28:29.334 --> 28:34.005
He's only 17, so yes,
the state can compel surgery,

28:34.047 --> 28:37.258
and we'd like that bullet
in the process.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.553
<i>[tense music]</i>

28:40.595 --> 28:44.724
[whirring]

28:44.766 --> 28:46.935
- Been asking myself
how Omar didn't realize

28:46.976 --> 28:50.689
he was moving his whole head
instead of just his eyes.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.066
And then I remembered
this avalanche victim.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.860
By the time we got there,
he had dug himself free.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.530
His hands were jet black
with frostbite,

28:58.571 --> 29:00.573
but he didn't realize it
until we pointed it out.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.617
- It's crazy, right,
how the brain

29:02.659 --> 29:05.203
recognizes problems
long before we do

29:05.245 --> 29:06.579
and instinctively compensates?

29:06.621 --> 29:09.416
Image up.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.918
- Oh, okay.
Look. Right here.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.379
Wait, Gene, can you--
can you blow that section up?

29:14.421 --> 29:16.089
- Mm-hmm.

29:16.131 --> 29:17.841
So we got microadenoma

29:17.882 --> 29:20.051
pressing against
the pituitary gland.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.845
Not that big either,
which is probably

29:21.886 --> 29:24.305
why CT didn't pick it up
this morning.

29:24.347 --> 29:27.100
- Well, the brain lesion
explains Omar's headaches,

29:27.142 --> 29:28.601
but the eye lock?

29:28.643 --> 29:30.937
- Well, you see this sort of
diffusion right around here?

29:30.979 --> 29:32.772
I'm pretty sure that's a bleed,

29:32.814 --> 29:34.441
which would definitely,
you know,

29:34.482 --> 29:35.692
put pressure
on the cranial nerves

29:35.734 --> 29:37.235
and could cause a lock.

29:37.277 --> 29:41.698
- Omar's headaches started
almost three years ago.

29:41.740 --> 29:44.034
Eye lock only set in
30 minutes ago,

29:44.075 --> 29:46.661
which means the bleed had to
have started just before then.

29:46.703 --> 29:49.622
- I think it might've happened
this morning

29:49.664 --> 29:50.999
when I was first talking
to him.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.542
- The BP spike?
- Yeah.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.627
A jolt of hypertension
like that,

29:54.669 --> 29:55.587
it'd absolutely
trigger a bleed.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.213
So the lesion is the root

29:57.255 --> 29:58.465
of all of Omar's issues.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.632
How do we fix it?

29:59.674 --> 30:01.926
- Well, we don't.
Neurosurgery does.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.019
So there's a slowness

30:11.061 --> 30:12.896
to Jodie's thought process
that's evident,

30:12.937 --> 30:15.648
but she grasped that she's ill,

30:15.690 --> 30:17.567
that there's a tumor present,

30:17.609 --> 30:18.985
that we recommend
it be resected,

30:19.027 --> 30:21.571
and the consequences
if she doesn't have surgery.

30:21.613 --> 30:22.822
Okay, four for four.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.824
Sounds like she's capable
of giving consent.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.952
So I'll get it, and then
I'll get her up to the OR.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.872
Okay.

30:30.914 --> 30:34.334
- The hospital's new AI
pegged Jodie as a drug-seeker.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.294
We almost let her walk
because of an algorithm.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.629
Opiates are a problem.

30:37.671 --> 30:40.298
I get building tools
to help solve it.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.842
- Yeah, except patients are
falling through the cracks.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.427
Well, luckily, not today.

30:44.469 --> 30:46.763
No...

30:46.805 --> 30:48.556
but I'm worried about tomorrow.

30:53.728 --> 30:55.605
I mean, it's a warrant.

30:55.647 --> 30:57.982
- Do we even have a move?
- Well, perhaps.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.027
Legally,
Med only has to operate

31:01.069 --> 31:04.322
if Aaron's life is at stake,
so is it?

31:04.364 --> 31:06.157
- BP's in the toilet.
He's still bleeding.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.702
Without surgery,
it only gets worse.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.912
- Okay, there's no projectile
to hand over

31:10.954 --> 31:13.790
if it never comes out,
so, Dr. Marcel,

31:13.832 --> 31:16.710
is there a way to operate
and stop Aaron's bleeding

31:16.751 --> 31:18.420
without removing the bullet?

31:18.461 --> 31:21.006
- That's
what I've been debating.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.550
The bullet is
in a terrible position,

31:23.591 --> 31:26.011
right on the neck
of the pancreas.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.888
All the damage is--
it's directly below it.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.390
So it's gotta come out, then.

31:30.432 --> 31:32.392
I didn't say that.

31:32.434 --> 31:33.810
Well, I'm confused.

31:33.852 --> 31:35.311
How do you get to the damaged
area of the pancreas

31:35.353 --> 31:37.063
if the bullet's in the way?

31:37.105 --> 31:39.649
- I'm just gonna have
to slip in around it.

31:46.573 --> 31:46.948
.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.116
- I am all for helping
to curb opiate abuse,

31:49.075 --> 31:50.493
but this OpioHealth AI
is flawed.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.996
The program has bugs,
and Med shouldn't use it.

31:53.038 --> 31:55.749
- Look, analytics
that help identify

31:55.790 --> 31:58.918
a patient's risk for misusing
opioids protect our liability.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.004
This is a program
Med should absolutely be using.

32:01.046 --> 32:02.672
- Liability is
the driving force?

32:02.714 --> 32:03.882
What about patient care?

32:03.923 --> 32:04.883
- You know
that's not what I'm saying.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.134
Plus, OpioHealth,
it's not meant

32:06.176 --> 32:07.802
to supplant
a doctor's diagnosis.

32:07.844 --> 32:11.056
- But it does!
It sows seeds of distrust.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.641
My patient today,
the scrips in her file,

32:13.683 --> 32:14.976
the ones
that got her red-flagged,

32:15.018 --> 32:16.978
they were for her aging cat.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.480
Veterinarian put it
in her name.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.565
- And I'm sorry about that,
but if you look hard enough

32:20.607 --> 32:23.360
into any AI program, you are
gonna find outlier cases.

32:23.401 --> 32:25.362
- The night shift had a patient
a few weeks ago

32:25.403 --> 32:28.031
who got flagged for filling
scrips in multiple states.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.699
Turns out he was a pilot.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.868
His pharmacies depend
on what route he's flying.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.995
- Yes, there are
some growing pains,

32:34.037 --> 32:36.247
but algorithms
are not the enemy.

32:36.289 --> 32:38.291
They can help predict
which patient

32:38.333 --> 32:40.669
is most likely to benefit
from a particular treatment,

32:40.710 --> 32:42.879
estimate ICU probabilities,

32:42.921 --> 32:44.506
whether a patient's
gonna deteriorate or die

32:44.547 --> 32:46.341
- after being discharged.
- Peter, we get it.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.009
You're a believer.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.346
But Dr. Asher's problem
is less with AI

32:51.388 --> 32:54.182
and more
with this specific program.

32:54.224 --> 32:57.811
And frankly,
I share her concerns.

32:58.478 --> 33:02.273
As soon as the board approved
testing OpioHealth,

33:02.315 --> 33:04.192
I reached out
to the parent company

33:04.234 --> 33:07.821
for clarity on how they amass
and interpret their data.

33:07.862 --> 33:12.117
They have yet
to share any information,

33:12.158 --> 33:14.786
and they claim
that it would infringe

33:14.828 --> 33:18.206
upon
their proprietary algorithm.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.582
Look.

33:19.624 --> 33:22.335
If OpioHealth isn't comfortable

33:22.377 --> 33:25.672
sharing
how their program works,

33:25.714 --> 33:29.592
I'm just not comfortable
using it.

33:29.634 --> 33:33.638
And given the growing number
of errant cases,

33:33.680 --> 33:35.265
I'm going to petition the board

33:35.306 --> 33:37.976
to remove the program
hospital-wide.

33:38.018 --> 33:39.352
- You're gonna be
picking a fight,

33:39.394 --> 33:42.230
and not just with the board
but with Jack Dayton.

33:42.272 --> 33:44.899
- Eh, so be it.
- Okay.

33:46.735 --> 33:50.071
[monitor beeping]

33:50.113 --> 33:53.366
- Okay. There's the papilla.
Gonna cannulate.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.455
Moving
into the pancreatic duct.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.376
- 2.0, visualize the neck
of the pancreas.

34:03.418 --> 34:05.378
<i>Loading.</i>

34:08.298 --> 34:10.383
- Clear view of the bullet.
It's right on the duct.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.094
- Uh-huh.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.013
Slipping around it.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.434
Okay. Deploy the stent.

34:24.064 --> 34:26.566
Looking good.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.654
The bullet is fully excluded
by the stent.

34:31.696 --> 34:34.449
It is no longer eroding
into the duct.

34:34.491 --> 34:35.992
Yeah.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.411
That should stop the bleed.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.497
Okay.

34:45.001 --> 34:47.045
- Hey, Omar.
How you feeling?

34:47.087 --> 34:51.007
- Uh, my eyes are moving.
[laughs softly]

34:51.049 --> 34:54.427
My, uh--my headache's gone,
so that's a win.

34:54.469 --> 34:58.056
I'm pretty--pretty embarrassed
over my comedy of errors.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.307
Don't be.

34:59.349 --> 35:01.267
Stuff like this happens,
you know?

35:01.309 --> 35:03.269
- Oh, anyway,
I promise, this is--

35:03.311 --> 35:04.729
this is never
gonna happen again.

35:04.771 --> 35:06.231
I'm gonna rehab my legs.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.607
I'm gonna get on a new diet.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.234
And I'm gonna add yoga,
meditation.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.568
I'm gonna add
a new sleep regimen.

35:10.610 --> 35:13.238
- Easy, Omar.
You know what they say.

35:13.279 --> 35:16.741
Mountains have a way
of dealing with overconfidence.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.201

35:18.243 --> 35:19.577
Then I'll see you at the gym.

I am no mountain climber

35:34.926 --> 35:38.054
if I were to kind of use that

a lot of other patients

37:47.559 --> 37:50.395
her prescription history,
right?

37:50.437 --> 37:52.230
And tomorrow,
someone could be defined

38:13.918 --> 38:16.254
I can't believe I'm the only
one who still thinks that way.

38:16.296 --> 38:19.090
- Well, sure hope not.

- Hey.

38:34.814 --> 38:35.940
So PD arrested someone

38:35.982 --> 38:38.151
in connection
with the robbery-homicide.

38:38.193 --> 38:40.111
Aaron's not
their prime suspect anymore.

38:40.153 --> 38:41.821
Yeah, I spoke to Kevin.

38:41.863 --> 38:43.114
Said he's gonna be cleared.

38:43.156 --> 38:44.949
Heading towards a happy ending.

38:44.991 --> 38:47.035
Thankfully.

38:47.077 --> 38:51.081
And despite the truth,
Aaron almost lost everything.

38:51.122 --> 38:52.665
Mm.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.340
Mags, you okay?

39:01.633 --> 39:04.386
Ben and I are separated.

39:06.596 --> 39:08.223
And I don't know
if we're on a path

39:08.264 --> 39:11.810
to getting back together or...

39:14.562 --> 39:15.605
Divorce.

39:15.647 --> 39:17.023
Oh, Mags.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.692
I'm so sorry.

39:20.443 --> 39:23.321
I love Ben with all my heart,

39:23.363 --> 39:26.199
and despite that truth, I...

39:28.952 --> 39:30.328
I might lose everything.

about our talk yesterday,

40:01.985 --> 40:04.112
about what's next.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.156
Yes.

40:06.197 --> 40:08.950
Yes to school.
Yes to a job.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.368
Yes to everything.

40:12.412 --> 40:16.082
I want to do it right
this time, Dad.

40:16.124 --> 40:18.335
Will you help me?

40:20.962 --> 40:22.922
Yeah.
