- I messed up,
Great-Grandma Harriet.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.485
I didn't mean to ruin
everyone's life.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.904
I just hope there's a way
to undo the spell.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.657
Gasp! "To put a spell
back on the shelf,

19:21.618 --> 19:23.829
Whoa.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.373
{\an8}Okay, don't worry guys,
I didn't call this meeting

19:26.456 --> 19:28.625
{\an8}to force any more
resolutions on you.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.794
{\an8}I just want to
make a confession.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.754
I was getting really fed up

19:32.838 --> 19:35.090
with the way you guys
walk all over me, so...

19:35.173 --> 19:37.759
I cast a spell
to take away your voices.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.469
I'm really sorry,
but don't worry,

19:39.553 --> 19:42.014
{\an1}I can fix it by transferring
the spell to myself.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.433
{\an1}Yes, I'll never speak again,
but I guess I deserve it for--

a birthday cake?

{\an1}I didn't take away
your voices?

you can't talk?

{\an1}at Pop Pop's
shuffleboard match?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.969
{\an1}But what about
my other spells?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.763
Lori, I killed your phone.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.309
Oh. So the battery just died.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.687
{\an1}But Lana, what about my spell
to make your butt itch?

20:34.566 --> 20:37.736
You rolled around in
poison ivy again?

Well, what about you, Lisa?

Didn't my spell make your
fingers sticky?

I...don't understand
any of that.
