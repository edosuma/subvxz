01:00.280 --> 01:02.560
-Well, this is it.
-This is what?

01:02.680 --> 01:03.840
What I bought this morning.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.440
What?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.440
This.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.480
-The land?
-No, you plonker!

01:13.600 --> 01:18.720
This pile of bricks.
Only cost me 100 nicker.
Nice one, eh?

01:19.920 --> 01:26.560
Oh, shrewd move, Del! I mean, people are
panic-buying bricks nowadays, aren't they?

01:26.920 --> 01:30.560
Who the hell's gonna buy
a pile of old bricks of us?

01:30.640 --> 01:32.760
Oh... A butcher or chemist.

01:33.800 --> 01:40.720
Who do you think is gonna buys bricks?
Builders! There's 200% profit here,
and all in the readies!

01:42.200 --> 01:43.440
Come here.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.280
They've just demolished a factory here
that used to make pre-fabricated
structures, right.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.800
Chalets, bungalows, greenhouses,
that sort of thing.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.000
So, I thought, using my noddle,
that we'd make enough
out of the bricks alone,

02:01.120 --> 02:03.360
but you never know
what's underneath, do you?

02:03.440 --> 02:08.680
Decent lengths of timber, bits of metal,
few gross of them roofing tiles.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.520
Come and see what I found.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.840
Get yer feelers on that.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.280
It's lead, Del !

02:37.040 --> 02:38.400
It's pure lead!

02:41.320 --> 02:43.880
There's 30 more boxes underneath.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.080
I estimate three ton altogether.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.520
Three ton? What's that at today's prices?

02:50.520 --> 02:52.280
That's about £1,000 !

02:53.320 --> 02:55.120
Am I brilliant or am I brilliant?

02:56.040 --> 03:00.200
Let's get some of it on the van.
We'll do it in three shifts. Come on.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.920
Is it ours, Del ?

03:04.800 --> 03:07.880
-'Course it's ours.
-Legally, Del ?

03:08.880 --> 03:13.000
Don't split hairs with me, Rodney.
Come on!

03:20.800 --> 03:23.520
GROANS WITH EFFORT

03:24.480 --> 03:26.640
That's the lot, Del Boy.

03:27.840 --> 03:33.760
Not there, Grandad!
We've got three tons of it
so we have to spread it around.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.280
Otherwise we'll be having tea
with Mrs Oboko downstairs.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.080
Right. I do hope all this
is not disturbing your royal highness?

03:45.160 --> 03:48.400
-No, don't mind me. You carry on.
-Thanks.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.880
Grandad, you've been carrying
this one upside-down!
This is the way.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.480
METAL RATTLING

03:57.800 --> 04:03.200
Oh, you are a lazy little bark.
Is that another dirty book
you're reading?

04:03.760 --> 04:06.560
You've got a mind like
a plain brown envelope.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.560
-I'll have a look at that
when you've finished.
-It's paperwork I found in a box.

04:11.640 --> 04:15.920
-Do you know what we've got here?
-Yeah, three ton of lovely lead.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.360
No, it's more than that.
That factory was producing
pre-fabricated structures, right?

04:21.480 --> 04:26.080
Bungalows, garden sheds etc.
This was one of their experimental lines.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.520
It's a do-it-yourself
nuclear fall-out shelter.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.760
SNIGGERS
Nuclear fall-out shelter...

04:34.040 --> 04:35.560
You are a wally!

04:37.120 --> 04:42.360
It is, honest. Look, here's the brochure,
here's the plan showing you
how to build it.

04:45.080 --> 04:50.840
He's right!
This is a nuclear fall-out shelter.
It's probably worth more than we thought!

04:51.360 --> 04:53.560
-You can't sell it!
-Don't want to put money on it, do you?

04:53.640 --> 04:55.840
What else can we do with it? Build it?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.800
-Yeah.
-Leave it out, Rodney!

04:59.160 --> 05:05.160
We've come so close to World War III over
Cuba, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Poland!

05:05.840 --> 05:09.600
It only takes a little rumbling
in the Middle East and missiles
are going to start flying.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.600
And what have we got to combat
the might of the Soviet Union?

05:13.680 --> 05:17.120
Three jump-jets
and a strongly-worded letter
to the Russian Ambassador!

05:17.800 --> 05:21.960
No, no! You don't know what
us Brits have up our sleeves!

05:22.040 --> 05:27.720
We can track their nuclear subs.
They can't keep track on ours.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.600
We've only got one.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.200
-Have we?
-I think so.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.920
Well, they don't know where it is.
Then again, do we?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
Bet your life we don't.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.960
This country's just not prepared for war.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.320
Nobody knows what we're supposed to do
in the event.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.160
Of course we do.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.800
All right, then. What would you do
if you heard the four minute warning?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.640
Well, what's it sound like first?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.920
That's it! No one knows.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.480
Maybe they'll ring church bells
or tell every ice-cream van
in the country to play its jingle.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.720
Your guess is as good as mine.

06:06.360 --> 06:13.120
The great powers have enough
nuclear weapons to destroy
this planet 30 times over!

06:15.640 --> 06:17.800
Neutron bombs, Del.

06:17.880 --> 06:24.560
Multi-warheads, chemicals that attack your
central nervous system that leave you
writhing in agony like a worm in bleach.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.360
Like you after a curry?

06:28.400 --> 06:31.280
Don't worry, forget about it.

06:31.640 --> 06:37.160
We've got £1,000 here.
Just think of what we do with it.
We can eat, drink and be merry.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.920
For tomorrow we die!

06:40.120 --> 06:44.480
Del, this is a godsend.
If we build this thing we'll be safe.

06:44.560 --> 06:50.720
It's got the inner and outer walls,
the air tubes, filters, everything.
Come on, Del !

06:50.800 --> 06:53.720
-Sorry.
-All right, soppy!

06:54.680 --> 06:59.880
Just suppose that we built it.
Where would we put it?

06:59.960 --> 07:05.680
You always fancied a weekend place.
How about a spot in the New Forest?

07:07.200 --> 07:12.360
How do we get from Peckham
to the New Forest in four minutes,
you old div?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.240
Grandad's allotment.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.520
It's a couple of miles away.
We could get to it in four minutes.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.360
On a Sunday, with a following wind.
Maybe.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.960
Let's give it a go.
We'll have a dummy run.
I'll get me stopwatch.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.600
STUTTERING IN BAFFLEMENT

07:25.680 --> 07:31.520
What's the point?
Say you can do it in four minutes,
what is it going to prove?

07:31.600 --> 07:35.600
Knowing them Russian rats,
they will probably declare war
in the middle of rush hour.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.200
-Where's Grandad?
-I don't know.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.480
DEL: Come on. Hurry up,
you stupid old git!

08:02.520 --> 08:05.920
-Get in!
-Three minutes and counting!

08:06.000 --> 08:07.720
Yes, all right, Rodney.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.080
The missiles just passed Sweden.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.280
A bloody fast, are we?
They only left Siberia 20 seconds ago!

08:16.880 --> 08:19.280
ENGINE STARTS

08:27.960 --> 08:33.040
RODNEY: Two minutes 15 seconds
and counting. Missiles are over the sea
and approaching Middlesborough.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.560
It's all right, Rodney.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.320
-All right! Put yer foot down, Del!
-I can't! I'm coming to a main road.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.560
How's it your side, Rodney?

08:44.640 --> 08:46.760
All right after this red one.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.040
RODNEY: No!

08:50.120 --> 08:51.800
TYRES SCREECH

08:51.880 --> 08:54.160
Bloody 'ell! I meant that red one!

08:54.240 --> 08:56.560
DEL: You tit, Rodney!

08:57.320 --> 09:00.080
RODNEY: They just flew over Luton.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.600
DEL: Sod Luton!

09:02.680 --> 09:05.400
RODNEY: One minute 35 and counting.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.480
SIREN WAILING

09:28.080 --> 09:30.560
INAUDIBLE

09:35.280 --> 09:39.560
Wayne, switch it off!

09:39.640 --> 09:41.760
SIREN OFF

09:47.280 --> 09:51.160
He's young, enthusiastic.
How are you, Del ?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.400
Not bad, Eric. Yourself?

09:53.480 --> 09:56.240
Can't complain.
Hello, Grandad.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.840
Hello, Eric Boy.

09:59.800 --> 10:05.600
Sixty mph?
You just heard the 4-minute warning?

10:05.920 --> 10:08.880
-Well, as it happens...
-Where's your tax disc?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.280
In the post.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.360
Where's the little sign saying so?

10:13.760 --> 10:15.520
It fell off.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.720
You been on them funny fags again, Rodney?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.080
-No!
-Good. Wayne wants his first nick.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.960
You might be able to help me, Del.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.640
I'm after some stolen summer-wear.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.320
Slacks, swimming trunks, bikinis...

10:33.840 --> 10:35.280
Are you after a promotion?

10:35.360 --> 10:39.960
No! Me and the wife are off to Corfu.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.320
Well, if I hear, I'll let you know.

10:43.400 --> 10:48.160
Good luck. See you. And, oi, take it easy.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.720
SIREN

10:52.800 --> 10:56.200
ERIC: Stop playing with that siren!

10:59.760 --> 11:03.480
-How're we doing?
-We're dead.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.800
Terrific. We'll never do it
in four minutes.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.960
It's not the end of the world.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.280
I thought it was!

11:12.400 --> 11:14.840
It's too far away.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.360
GRANDAD: I've been thinking.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.600
Give him an aspirin!

11:19.520 --> 11:22.480
I may have found us just the spot.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.520
VOICES ECHOING

11:27.600 --> 11:32.520
RODNEY: Is that door shut?
DEL: Don't worry.
No radiation can get in 'ere.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.040
What's this pipe?

11:34.120 --> 11:35.960
THUMPING

11:36.040 --> 11:40.520
Don't do that. It's fragile.
Del, don't!

11:40.600 --> 11:44.960
That's our air filter,
our umbilical cord!

11:45.040 --> 11:49.160
And you must never bash
an umbilical cord with a hammer!

11:49.280 --> 11:50.440
I see.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.800
So this is our only source of oxygen!?
What happens if a pigeon nests
in the other end?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.000
We're all dead, I suppose?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.960
Pigeons don't nest during nuclear wars.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.480
-This isn't a nuclear war!
-We're practising for one.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.040
Do the bloody pigeons know that?

12:06.120 --> 12:10.520
A pigeon will not nest in our tube!
Have faith in me, please.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.080
Don't trust him, Del Boy.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.280
He said my telly would work in 'ere!

12:18.240 --> 12:23.840
I said sorry! There's some pages
missing in this brochure.
I don't know everything.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.200
Anyway, that's why we're having
this weekend practice, to iron out
the wrinkles.

12:29.280 --> 12:35.080
Well, this has to be back at that
site first thing Monday morning.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.200
Or them Paddies'll go mad.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.840
You are a wally, you really are.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.520
You don't have to stay here, Del.

12:56.600 --> 13:03.160
I do! I've got £1,000-worth of lead
tied up in this shelter.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.400
You two would probably lose it!

13:06.840 --> 13:11.040
Oh, just think what I could do
with £1,000.

13:11.120 --> 13:16.840
I could fly to America,
I could buy myself a flash Rollocks watch.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.240
Have me adenoids out privately.

13:22.320 --> 13:27.680
But how many people have their own
private nuclear fall-out shelter?

13:27.760 --> 13:32.720
That's true. With our luck,
there won't be a bloody war!

13:32.800 --> 13:38.840
We ought to bomb Russia
and then declare war on them.

13:39.240 --> 13:45.200
We can say the declaration got held up
by a communist-inspired PO strike.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.080
That's typical of a ruthless
little mercenary like you, innit?

13:51.160 --> 13:58.040
Me? Who goes round the estate
every Christmas making sure the old
folk have enough to eat and drink!

13:58.280 --> 14:04.160
And who drove round during the riot
in Brixton selling paving stones
to the rioters?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.440
Did you think they'd all run home
and start building patios?

14:12.480 --> 14:17.000
Mine is not to reason why...
Mine is but to sell and buy.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.200
Anyway, the trouble with them kids
in Brixton is frustration.

14:25.520 --> 14:29.720
Society has denied them
the birthright of a war.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.040
I don't believe you! You're saying
war is our birthright!

14:33.160 --> 14:34.360
Yes, it is.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.160
For centuries,

14:38.240 --> 14:42.600
every generation of British youth
has been guaranteed a decent war.

14:42.680 --> 14:48.640
But that "Over the top, take that, Fritz"

14:48.720 --> 14:50.800
type of courage is obsolete.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.240
The next war will be fought
by computer programmers.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.880
That's what frustrates modern youth.
You see 'em in the arcades,

15:00.440 --> 15:05.480
doing their National Service
on the Space Invaders.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.280
But a real war is Errol Flynn

15:10.360 --> 15:13.640
leading the gallant 600
into the Valley of Death.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.160
John Mills marooned in a dinghy.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.560
Kenneth More not letting a little
thing like no legs get him down.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.800
Glorious and valiant war, that...

15:26.880 --> 15:29.560
-Don't talk like a berk, Del!
-What?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.400
What do you know about it?

15:31.480 --> 15:35.280
The only war you ever fought
is the inch war.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.920
I seen all the films!

15:37.000 --> 15:39.720
Tomato sauce and stuntmen!

15:39.800 --> 15:45.760
I remember when I was a nipper,
seeing the soldiers marchin' off
to battle.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.920
Oh, yes, it was a glorious sight.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.360
Yeah, them spears and chariots
must have stirred the blood.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.160
-Just hear him out!
-All right.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.000
My brother was at Passchendaele.

16:00.080 --> 16:05.560
Nigh on half a million died there,
all for five miles of mud!

16:06.560 --> 16:10.640
I was at King's Cross Station
when his regiment came home
after the armistice.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.640
Most off them was carried off the train.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.280
I saw men with limbs missing,

16:18.360 --> 16:20.080
blind men,

16:20.160 --> 16:25.480
men whose lungs had been shot
to bits by mustard gas.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.080
While the nation celebrated,
they was hidden away,

16:30.160 --> 16:33.880
in big, grey buildings,
far from the public gaze.

16:34.680 --> 16:40.080
I mean, courage like that could put
you right off your victory dinner.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.680
They promised us homes fit for heroes,

16:45.760 --> 16:49.480
they gave us heroes fit for homes.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.560
I...I'd never wear a British uniform
on principle.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.720
What principle?

16:59.800 --> 17:02.320
On the principle that the Russians
might shoot at it.

17:04.880 --> 17:10.240
The politicians and the military men
used to con you, you see.

17:10.440 --> 17:15.160
They had youngsters believing that
their country really did need them.

17:15.440 --> 17:22.080
They had lads of 14 pretending
to be 18 just so they could fight
for their King and country!

17:23.120 --> 17:25.240
They accepted the little sprogs?

17:25.320 --> 17:29.320
Yeah. My brother lied about his age.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.880
Pretended he was 18?

17:30.960 --> 17:33.840
No! He was 18.
He pretended he was 14.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.400
But they saw through it.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.520
I think it was the moustache.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.680
Yeah. 14-year-olds can't...

17:45.120 --> 17:47.040
Bloody hell.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.920
BANGING

17:53.000 --> 17:55.320
What are you doing?

17:55.400 --> 17:59.280
I think there's a pigeon nesting
in our air-tube...

17:59.440 --> 18:02.200
But I'll frighten it away.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.080
The battery's low an' all.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.560
How long do they last?

18:20.640 --> 18:22.440
About 12 hours each.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.120
Have we been here 12 hours?

18:25.200 --> 18:29.720
Only 36 to go. Doesn't time fly
when you're having fun?

18:30.640 --> 18:34.840
Listen, Oppenheimer,

18:34.920 --> 18:39.320
if a bomb was to drop round 'ere,
how long would we 'ave to stay in 'ere?

18:39.720 --> 18:43.880
Well, it depends upon the degree
of contamination outside.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.160
We're in a vulnerable position
being so close to the docks.

18:47.240 --> 18:53.880
But I would say, roughly,
about two years.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.400
-BOTH: Two years?
-Give or take a week or two.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.240
If you think I'm spending two years
in a lead-lined nissen hut

19:02.320 --> 19:06.480
with you two and a chemical bloody kazi,
you've another thing coming.

19:06.560 --> 19:11.000
But we'd die of radiation poisoning
out there!

19:11.080 --> 19:15.720
If we stay inside,
we'll die of bloody lead poisoning!

19:15.800 --> 19:20.560
The rescue team will whip us
to a scrap metal yard!

19:20.640 --> 19:27.000
Yeah. And these batteries
that purify the air last 12 hours, right?

19:28.520 --> 19:33.280
So how many of them do we need?
You're the one with the Maths GCE.

19:33.640 --> 19:39.640
Well, it's two a day, seven days a week...
Two sevens are fourteen...

19:39.720 --> 19:43.600
Two sevens are 14! Just like that!
No hesitation!

19:43.680 --> 19:48.720
Shut up! So that's 14 times 52...

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
Twice.

19:49.880 --> 19:56.400
I know! That works out at about...
1,450-odd.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.920
And I thought we'd need a lot.

20:02.080 --> 20:07.040
So all we need is 1,450
heavy-duty batteries,

20:07.120 --> 20:12.240
five tons of canned food,
30,000 gallons of fresh water,

20:12.320 --> 20:16.400
and a huge warehouse to store it all in.

20:16.480 --> 20:20.120
I said there'd be some wrinkles.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.400
A few wrinkles?

20:22.480 --> 20:25.760
We've got more wrinkles
than an elephant's bleedin' trunk!

20:27.560 --> 20:31.600
All things considered,
I think I'd rather be outside

20:31.680 --> 20:33.880
and go instantly with the bomb.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.920
You think it would be instant?

20:37.240 --> 20:41.000
Them bombs contain Strontium 90,
not Nescafe!

20:41.400 --> 20:46.200
They cause radioactive rain to fall.

20:46.280 --> 20:51.320
That penetrates the skin,
causing violent sores and disease.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.280
Best not wear anything decent, eh?

20:54.360 --> 20:56.880
Be serious for a minute?

20:56.960 --> 21:02.280
Look, it's here: "Then the radiation
begins to attack your metabolism,

21:02.720 --> 21:05.720
"you undergo drastic biological changes."

21:05.800 --> 21:06.880
That's metamorphosis.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.240
Yeah. Yeah...

21:10.880 --> 21:15.440
Anyway... "Your shape and form will alter
radically as the mutation takes effect."

21:15.960 --> 21:18.640
Doesn't sound too promising,
do it, Del boy?

21:18.760 --> 21:23.800
I mean, you have a job
getting a suit off the peg now.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.600
All right, you can laugh!

21:26.680 --> 21:29.200
But this city will be inhabited

21:29.280 --> 21:36.120
by vacant-eyed sub-humans dragging
their knuckles through the debris
that was once civilisation!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.960
Sounds like Stamford Bridge!

21:40.320 --> 21:45.280
If this is true, why the hell
are we trying to survive?

21:45.360 --> 21:50.760
It's our duty. When we leave here,
we'll be intact, perfect.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.120
Yeah, well... People like us
will replenish the species.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.880
We'll be like two new Adams going
forth to multiply.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.360
Yeah. And you, you dirty little ram,
will be out there multiplying
quicker than a pocket calculator!

22:10.760 --> 22:13.200
I've seen it all now.
I've seen it all now.

22:13.520 --> 22:18.480
He's almost praying
for the end of civilisation,
just so he can put it about a bit!

22:19.280 --> 22:23.440
-What time do you make it?
-12.10.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.680
C'mon, Grandad, bed time.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.440
Well, if my species needs me,
I shall not be found wanting.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.600
I bet.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.480
That's one thing
to look forward to, eh, Grandad?

22:36.280 --> 22:41.360
Me and Rodney will make a foursome
with a couple of mutants.

22:41.440 --> 22:46.600
I'll 'ave the one with the eye
under her arm. I don't fancy yours.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.600
-It won't be like that!
-You bet it won't.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.200
Anyway, you go out
with mutants in peace time.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.000
Look at that thing you took out
on Thursday!

22:59.080 --> 23:02.400
I told my mates you were taking her
to market!

23:03.160 --> 23:06.240
I warned you it was a bit ragged.

23:06.320 --> 23:11.160
You liar! You told me she looked
like the one out of the Abba.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.120
Yeah, the one with the beard.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.160
Anyway, we won't be the only ones
to survive the holocaust.

23:18.240 --> 23:22.840
There'll be various institutions,
public schools, that sort of thing.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.960
I bet Roedean's got a shelter, eh, Del?

23:28.360 --> 23:33.640
A thousand nubile girls,
in a shelter in school uniform.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.400
You sicko!

23:39.920 --> 23:43.440
The uniforms are of no importance.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.560
I don't know why I mentioned them.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.080
'Cause you're a twisted,
warped little pervo!

23:49.560 --> 23:51.520
Yeah, maybe.

23:51.600 --> 23:57.440
But it's in the line of duty, Del.
They're perfect specimens.
They're intelligent.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.840
'Course they're intelligent.
They're still at school!

24:00.920 --> 24:03.720
And fit, all that hockey.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.880
You might fancy the headmistress.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.400
Oh, thank you very much.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.680
Well, it's worth bearing in mind,
in an emergency.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.120
Hmm... Well, goodnight, Rodney.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.000
Goodnight, Del.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.640
Goodnight, Grandad.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.880
Goodnight, Del.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.760
Goodnight, Grandad.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.640
Goodnight, Rodney.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
Goodnight, Jumbo.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.400
Shut up!

24:49.760 --> 24:51.360
GRANDAD: War is hell.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.360
What?

24:58.440 --> 25:02.080
War is hell.
Alan Ladd said that.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.080
Did he really? Go to sleep.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.080
Or was it Audie Murphy?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.440
I dunno! I'm tired.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.240
It must have been one of them...

25:16.320 --> 25:19.960
Maybe they both bloody said it!
Go to sleep!

25:23.840 --> 25:29.320
-No, it was Rock Hudson.
-Will you two go to sleep?

25:37.160 --> 25:41.680
-Rodney... 'Ere, Rodney...
-Hmm?

25:42.720 --> 25:44.880
Don't keep your eyes closed!
I'm talking to you!

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
What?

25:46.040 --> 25:51.400
It might not be a bad idea
to survive the next war after all.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.680
You got something up your sleeve?

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
Just a little idea, that's all.

25:56.840 --> 25:57.960
What's the point?

25:58.040 --> 26:04.320
All the animals will be dead,
the soil will be contaminated.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.600
Where'll we get something to eat?

26:08.680 --> 26:11.120
Bound to be a little Paki shop
open somewhere.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.960
And we won't be the only survivors.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.440
I'm thinking about all them girls
at that Roedean School.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.560
-Ah-ha!
-No, no, nothing like that.

26:23.640 --> 26:28.840
You see, most of those girls
are the daughters of the knobless.

26:30.360 --> 26:34.840
-What...
-The knobless.
The knobless.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.800
It's French for nobility, innit?

26:38.880 --> 26:41.240
Sorry, I was miles away.

26:42.040 --> 26:48.920
I mean, you could meet a scruffy
17-year-old in a dirty hockey shirt
and muddy plimsolls,

26:49.680 --> 26:53.720
and you could be talking to
the 459th in line for the throne.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.680
But after the bombs have dropped,

26:58.760 --> 27:04.200
that scruffy 17-year-old could be
first in line for the throne.

27:04.840 --> 27:10.720
So if I got on me bike,
nipped down there sharpish
and did me Adam's act,

27:10.800 --> 27:16.040
splash of Brut,
took her out for a steak meal,
loads o' charm,

27:17.040 --> 27:19.000
I could end up being the King.

27:21.240 --> 27:25.520
Mind you, a touch of Strontium 90
and I could end up being the Queen.

27:28.960 --> 27:35.680
Either way, the tax-man
wouldn't be able to touch me,
'cause I'd be the head of state.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.640
And with you out there multiplying
all over the place...

27:40.720 --> 27:42.000
RODNEY SNIGGERS
Yeah!

27:42.120 --> 27:44.720
I'd not be short of subjects.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.960
We'd go for holidays in Mustique.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.480
Grandad could be the Queen Mother!

27:58.480 --> 28:01.000
We'll dye his hat pink!

28:05.480 --> 28:10.000
Even if that didn't happen,
and I can't see how I can fail,

28:11.400 --> 28:15.280
if the entire civilisation
was wiped out,

28:16.160 --> 28:20.880
we'll all be equal,
'cause all of us will have nothing.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.440
Right.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.960
Except us, Rodders.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.600
And what'll we have, Del?

28:27.680 --> 28:33.760
A grand's-worth of lead!
Pretty shrewd, eh, Rodney?

28:33.840 --> 28:37.120
Yeah, a real mind-bender.

28:38.080 --> 28:44.960
Yeah. Yeah, we'll be all right.
We'll survive, Rodney,
'cause we're survivors.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.000
Hmm... Yeah...

28:48.080 --> 28:52.200
When the alarm bells start ringing
and the missiles start flying,

28:52.280 --> 28:56.840
and everyone's rushing about
trying to find somewhere to hide,

28:56.920 --> 29:01.440
we'll be tucked up here
in our own little nuclear shelter.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.800
The end of the world could be
just the break we're looking for.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.840
Oh, we're pretty shrewd.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.840
If they dropped the bomb now,

29:13.920 --> 29:15.720
we'd be as safe as houses.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.000
