You've done it here,
what, how many times?

04:31.577 --> 04:34.614
With you, it's just
a question of how many.

04:34.647 --> 04:37.618
How many woman have
you fucked in our bed?

04:37.651 --> 04:39.387
Well, we both know it's true.

What the hell?

05:21.127 --> 05:22.997

I got something to tell you,
Layton.

06:24.724 --> 06:27.126
Marriage is over.

06:27.159 --> 06:30.630
Linda and I
are getting a divorce.

06:30.663 --> 06:33.967
Jesus, Dad... I'm sorry.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.972
But no big surprise,
and probably for the best.

06:41.108 --> 06:42.743
Is that it?

06:42.776 --> 06:45.980
Ten whole seconds of sympathy

06:46.012 --> 06:50.550
whose heart hanging out of
his chest like a bag of trash?

06:50.584 --> 06:55.189
I am sympathetic Dad.
Just not very surprised.

06:55.221 --> 06:58.525
Yeah, you know what?
Neither am I, really.

06:58.558 --> 07:00.594
Yeah.

07:00.627 --> 07:03.998
So, to what do I owe
the honour of being invited

07:04.031 --> 07:07.935
to beautiful downtown Hamilton
on a Tuesday afternoon?

07:07.967 --> 07:12.739
Well, I'm just going
to come out and say it.

07:12.772 --> 07:16.109
I may be in love,
and I'm definitely gay.

07:21.113 --> 07:24.150
Wow. Wow.

07:24.183 --> 07:27.687
I never expected that.

07:27.721 --> 07:28.988
Does your mother know?

07:29.022 --> 07:30.224
Told her last week.

07:30.257 --> 07:32.593
Hm, and your sister?

07:32.625 --> 07:35.228
Yeah, of course.

07:35.262 --> 07:36.731
You're cool with this, right?

07:38.098 --> 07:41.969
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm totally cool with it.

07:42.002 --> 07:45.739
You know, it's just
a bit of a change for me.

07:45.772 --> 07:47.974
You're still my little boy.
My darling little boy

07:48.007 --> 07:49.943
that I used to carry on
my shoulders when you were

07:49.976 --> 07:52.078
no bigger than a peanut.

07:52.111 --> 07:54.013
Yeah.

07:54.046 --> 07:56.583
Yeah.

07:56.616 --> 08:01.321
To maybe being in love
to definitely gay, I mean...

08:01.354 --> 08:04.724
Ah, Jesus.

08:04.757 --> 08:06.060
Okay.

08:06.092 --> 08:08.261
I love you, man.

08:08.295 --> 08:09.997
Thanks, Dad. I love you, too.

08:14.635 --> 08:16.670
Okay. Okay, Dad. That's great.

08:16.702 --> 08:19.772
Yeah, it's great
to maybe be in love,

08:19.805 --> 08:21.875
to be definitely gay.

08:23.743 --> 08:24.945
Okay.

08:30.116 --> 08:32.286
What do you keep looking at?

08:32.319 --> 08:34.854
Nothing. Nothing.

08:40.292 --> 08:43.730
And, you know,
that's something that Linda

08:43.763 --> 08:46.233
never really understood.

08:46.266 --> 08:52.171
How good it is
to be really in love.

08:52.204 --> 08:55.209
Because that's all we have in
the end, you know?

08:55.242 --> 08:57.144
Love.

08:57.176 --> 09:00.714
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

09:05.285 --> 09:09.189
Well, we really covered a lot
for a little father-son chat,

09:09.222 --> 09:11.325
but I do have to eat,
game day and all.

09:11.358 --> 09:13.893
So, what do you feel like?

09:13.926 --> 09:16.229
The steaks here are really good.

09:27.741 --> 09:31.245

And now, of course,
here you are smoking

12:58.984 --> 13:00.620
fucking cigarette

in my fucking house,
when you know fucking well

13:04.424 --> 13:09.029
that I hate the smell
of fucking cigarette smoke.

13:09.061 --> 13:11.063
Now that's some fine language

13:11.097 --> 13:13.467

13:18.171 --> 13:20.674
What the...?

13:20.706 --> 13:22.375
Dad?

13:22.408 --> 13:23.943
Hello, Sam.

13:27.446 --> 13:29.115
What are you doing here?

13:29.148 --> 13:31.250
Well, I was having
a quiet drink and a smoke?

13:31.283 --> 13:32.919
Should I put it out?

13:32.953 --> 13:35.522
No, no, go on. Enjoy the cancer.
Can't hurt you now.

13:35.555 --> 13:37.524
You're still dead, aren't you?

13:37.556 --> 13:40.560
Yes, I am still dead,

13:40.593 --> 13:42.262
and no it can't.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.400
Nice looking place you got here.

13:46.432 --> 13:48.467
Thanks.

13:48.501 --> 13:51.271
You, on the other hand,
you don't look so good.

13:51.304 --> 13:52.673
I know, I know, I know.

13:52.705 --> 13:55.308
Been going through
kind of a rough patch.

13:55.342 --> 13:56.510
Such is life.

13:56.542 --> 13:59.478
Tell me about it.

13:59.512 --> 14:02.082
Just wait till you
shuffle off this mortal coil.

14:03.650 --> 14:05.419
Funny you should
mention old Hamlet.

14:05.451 --> 14:08.554
He was visited by the ghost
of his dead father as well.

14:08.588 --> 14:10.123
Or was he?

14:11.424 --> 14:12.592
Right.

14:12.624 --> 14:15.628
Aye, there's the rub.

14:24.503 --> 14:27.106
You're either a ghost,

14:27.140 --> 14:30.510
or I'm even more fucked
than previously believed.

14:30.542 --> 14:33.546
Does seem that way,
but there's nothing yet broken

14:33.579 --> 14:35.581
that can't be fixed.

14:35.614 --> 14:39.986
Now, I hear you've been having
a little marital trouble.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.023
Oh, yeah.

14:46.493 --> 14:50.296
She met somebody
she prefers fucking,

14:50.329 --> 14:53.532
or maybe was just sick of my
bullshit, if I'm being honest.

14:53.565 --> 14:55.735
You have to be honest
with ghosts, don't you?

14:55.768 --> 14:57.570
Probably.

14:59.272 --> 15:01.041
She probably was
sick of your bullshit,

15:01.074 --> 15:02.309
probably too young
for you as well.

15:02.342 --> 15:04.678
Thanks, Dad.

15:04.710 --> 15:08.147
You know, I never saw a man
go with so many women.

15:08.180 --> 15:11.218
Is that a mental thing,
like some with the hand-washing?

15:11.251 --> 15:12.752
I don't know, Dad, maybe.

15:15.055 --> 15:17.089
And you with all those
pretty wives waiting at home.

15:17.123 --> 15:18.592
Yep.

15:18.624 --> 15:20.626
There is definitely something
wrong with you, son.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.030
That's very
perceptive of you, Dad.

15:23.063 --> 15:26.266
I mean, really perceptive.

15:26.299 --> 15:30.237
And now that we're talking,
you know, man to man,

15:30.270 --> 15:34.541
honestly about women...

15:34.574 --> 15:36.642
I want to ask you something.

15:39.179 --> 15:41.481
Why...

15:41.513 --> 15:44.217
Why did our mother leave us?

15:46.085 --> 15:49.488
And why did she leave you?

15:49.522 --> 15:52.459
That is the question.

15:52.492 --> 15:54.493
It's a very good question.

15:54.526 --> 15:58.232
Yeah? And what's the answer?

15:59.799 --> 16:02.169
I don't know.

16:02.201 --> 16:04.804
What do you mean
you don't fucking know?

16:04.838 --> 16:06.540
You're a ghost.

16:06.573 --> 16:10.811
You're an all-knowing,
supernatural... how can you...

16:10.844 --> 16:14.214
Ghosts know some things,
and they don't know others.

16:14.247 --> 16:15.582
It's the same as people.

16:18.184 --> 16:21.188
What's the point of being
a ghost, if you don't things?

16:21.220 --> 16:24.523
Hamlet's father came back,
he knew loads of things.

16:24.556 --> 16:27.094
You don't know anything
worth two shits.

16:29.262 --> 16:32.299
Do you know something?
You're a terrible ghost.

16:32.331 --> 16:36.836
A fucking awful, terrible,
lame, terrible fucking ghost.

16:38.637 --> 16:40.406
Easy.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.210
Alright.

16:47.412 --> 16:50.584
Alright.
Let's get you to bed.

16:50.617 --> 16:51.818
I'm not tired.

16:51.850 --> 16:54.220
I know, love.
Let's get to bed.

17:30.957 --> 17:35.195
Does anybody have a breath mint?

17:35.228 --> 17:36.395
I do sir.

17:36.429 --> 17:38.297
Laura, yeah.

17:38.331 --> 17:40.167
Oh, Certs.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.701
I haven't seen
these for a long time.

17:42.735 --> 17:43.937
My mom loves them.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.373
Oh, of course she does,

17:46.405 --> 17:51.210
That's because they're
two, two, two mints in one.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.913
Sure sir, whatever you say.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.248
What about that as poetry?

17:55.280 --> 17:58.450
"Two, two,
two mints in one."

17:58.484 --> 18:00.453
Hmm?

18:00.486 --> 18:02.255
Anybody?

18:02.287 --> 18:06.727
Just for the sheer
poetry of it. No?

18:09.394 --> 18:12.498
What about this one?

18:12.532 --> 18:14.968
"I will arise and go now,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.903
"for always night and day

18:17.937 --> 18:22.209
"I hear lake water lapping with
low sounds by the shore;

18:22.241 --> 18:26.512
"While I stand upon the roadway,
or on the pavements grey,

18:26.546 --> 18:30.816
"oh, I hear it in the
deep heart's core."

18:42.327 --> 18:43.529
Where... where was I?

18:43.563 --> 18:45.364
Frank Scott's politics, sir.

18:45.398 --> 18:47.634
Frank Scott's politics.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.536
I put it to you

18:50.569 --> 18:55.474
that it is very difficult to
understand Scott's politics

18:55.507 --> 18:57.611
without first considering
The Great Depression,

18:57.643 --> 19:02.281
and the huge impact that that
had on his generation,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.883
to witness a whole world
thrown to the dogs

19:04.917 --> 19:08.822
by the forces of
global capitalism.

19:08.854 --> 19:11.790
Anybody have a comment on that?

19:11.824 --> 19:14.393
Draw parallels?

19:14.427 --> 19:16.296
Hold forth? Anybody?

19:18.698 --> 19:22.768
What about you with
the phone there, Mr. Clark?

19:22.802 --> 19:24.371
Oh, sorry.

19:30.776 --> 19:32.711
I would like
to remind management

19:32.745 --> 19:37.684
that the drinks are watered,
the hat-check girl has syphilis,

19:37.717 --> 19:39.486
and the band is composed

19:39.518 --> 19:41.755
of former SS monsters.

19:41.787 --> 19:46.625
However, since it is New Year's
Eve and I have lip cancer,

19:46.659 --> 19:50.630
I will place my
paper hat on my concussion...

19:50.662 --> 19:53.333
and dance.

19:58.871 --> 20:03.310
That was very impressive,
everyone,

20:03.343 --> 20:07.346
but, um, specifically,

20:07.380 --> 20:08.915
how does Leonard Cohen's

20:08.948 --> 20:13.519
"The Music Crept By Us"
refer to Frank Scott's politics?

20:13.553 --> 20:15.522
Excuse me, Professor O'Shea?

20:15.555 --> 20:17.590
You just recited
"The Music Crept By Us".

20:17.623 --> 20:21.628
What does that have to do with
Scott being a dirty commie rat?

20:21.661 --> 20:23.063
I don't understand, sir.

20:23.095 --> 20:25.332
I mean, all I said was that

20:25.364 --> 20:27.834
I don't know much about
The Big Depression, so...

20:29.369 --> 20:32.672
That's enough...
enough poetry for today.

20:48.554 --> 20:51.490
And the players on the ice,

20:51.524 --> 20:55.395
they were like...
ice-skating angels.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.763
I saw an angel once...

20:56.796 --> 20:58.797
but I was on acid.

20:58.831 --> 21:01.368
Yeah, but I
wasn't on acid.

21:01.401 --> 21:03.370
Yeah.

21:03.402 --> 21:04.738
Bonsoir.

21:04.770 --> 21:07.873
Merci.

21:07.907 --> 21:11.010
Yeah, but to my point, you know,

21:11.043 --> 21:13.046
maybe these are flashbacks.

21:13.078 --> 21:15.514
No, but they
weren't flashbacks.

21:15.547 --> 21:17.950
It was more like a dream.

21:17.984 --> 21:22.088
Well... then we're back
to my original hypothesis.

21:22.121 --> 21:24.056
Yeah, which is?

21:24.090 --> 21:27.594
That you're going
batshit crazy, old friend.

21:30.563 --> 21:33.100
Or crazier, depending
on one's perspective.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.536
But seriously, though,
tomorrow, first thing,

21:37.569 --> 21:39.905
you go see a doctor, okay?
Because I'm sure

21:39.939 --> 21:42.108
that there's some kind of
obvious explanation, you know?

21:42.141 --> 21:44.076
Like... I don't know...

21:44.110 --> 21:46.579
chewing Vicodin and
drinking hard liquor

21:46.612 --> 21:48.046
for the last 48 hours,

21:48.080 --> 21:51.751
and now, you're slipping in
and out of some kind of trippy,

21:51.784 --> 21:53.652
booze-fueled psychosis.

21:53.686 --> 21:57.090
Yeah, yeah.
You could be right about that.

21:59.491 --> 22:02.694
Speaking of, maybe you
should take a little break.

22:02.728 --> 22:05.632
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

22:05.664 --> 22:09.501
First thing tomorrow.
Donny, can I get another one?

22:09.535 --> 22:10.870
Large. Thanks.

22:10.902 --> 22:12.070
Coming right up, Professor.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.476
Oh. Sorry.

22:16.508 --> 22:19.746
Oh, little bit early for
Halloween, isn't it?

22:19.778 --> 22:22.114
Why don't I buy you a drink?

22:22.148 --> 22:27.786
You know, I don't want you to
take this personally...

22:27.819 --> 22:29.588
I've never liked Halloween.

22:29.622 --> 22:31.524
Do you like Christmas?
I love Christmas.

22:31.556 --> 22:35.995
Two cannibals were
eating a clown.

22:36.027 --> 22:38.832
One say to the other,

22:38.864 --> 22:41.034
"Does this taste
funny to you?"

22:43.201 --> 22:45.939
Do you get it?
'Cause it's a clown.

22:45.971 --> 22:48.074
"Does this taste
funny to you?"

22:48.106 --> 22:51.677
Oh, Jesus,
you're a hard crowd, Frank.

22:51.710 --> 22:55.515
♪ Me and my wife are parted

22:57.016 --> 23:01.019

23:16.902 --> 23:19.939
Any changes is vision,
speech or hearing?

23:19.971 --> 23:22.075
Aside from the hallucinations.

23:22.107 --> 23:23.275
Maybe.

23:23.308 --> 23:25.911
Look at the light.

23:29.047 --> 23:31.517
Any changes in mood,
personality,

23:31.551 --> 23:33.586
or ability to concentrate?

23:33.619 --> 23:35.588
Well, I broke up
with my wife on Tuesday,

23:35.621 --> 23:38.791
so I've been feeling
a little bit low.

23:38.824 --> 23:41.026
Oh, sorry to hear that.

23:41.059 --> 23:43.562
Problems with memory?

23:43.595 --> 23:45.998
Um...
What was the question again?

23:46.032 --> 23:47.800
That was a little joke.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.769
That was a little funny.

23:50.803 --> 23:54.707
And finally, problems
balancing or walking?

23:54.739 --> 23:57.175
No, only when I'm really drunk.

23:57.209 --> 23:59.144
And are you really
drunk very often?

23:59.178 --> 24:01.915
Um, lately, yeah.

24:01.948 --> 24:04.150
Which means?

24:04.182 --> 24:06.151
Oh, for the last
few days and nights,

24:06.184 --> 24:08.153
I've been absolutely plastered,

24:08.187 --> 24:10.790
and a healthy consumption
of alcohol for, oh...

24:10.823 --> 24:12.825
about 40 years.

24:12.857 --> 24:14.226
How many drinks a day?

24:14.259 --> 24:17.162
Five? Seven? 13?

24:17.196 --> 24:18.798
For the last 40 years?

24:18.831 --> 24:20.166
Mm-hmm.

24:20.199 --> 24:22.936
And for the last few days?

24:22.969 --> 24:25.037
23. 39.

24:25.071 --> 24:26.238
Per day?

24:26.271 --> 24:27.839
Yep.

24:27.873 --> 24:31.811
Well congratulations, Samuel,

24:31.844 --> 24:34.013
you're lucky to be alive.

24:34.046 --> 24:35.715
That's what
they keep telling me.

24:35.748 --> 24:38.284
And for once,
they are correct.

24:38.316 --> 24:40.353
Well, you don't
have all of the symptoms

24:40.385 --> 24:43.288
associated with
cancerous brain tumors.

24:44.824 --> 24:46.726
And most of the
symptoms you do have -

24:46.758 --> 24:50.829
dead father
and singing students aside -

24:50.863 --> 24:53.700
can be explained
by your alcoholism.

24:53.732 --> 24:56.635
Yeah, but I'm not
an alcoholic.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.671
Okay, fine. So, you've been
drinking to excess

24:58.703 --> 25:02.240
your entire adult life,
but you're not an alcoholic.

25:02.274 --> 25:04.877
Good. Well, that's settled.

25:04.910 --> 25:08.247
Now, would you care to
join me for a drink?

25:08.279 --> 25:11.151
No. I would not.

25:12.117 --> 25:14.319
Samuel, do you have
anyone you can talk to

25:14.353 --> 25:17.023
about what's happening
with you?

25:17.055 --> 25:21.059
Apparently not.
Why don't you call me Sam?

25:21.093 --> 25:23.329
No. I meant
close friends, family.

25:23.362 --> 25:25.364
Loads. Can barely
swing a dead cat.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.101
Good. So, talk to them

25:28.133 --> 25:30.937
and I'll see you again on the
eighth for our follow up,

25:30.969 --> 25:33.238
and we can go over
the MRI results.

25:33.271 --> 25:34.306
It's a date.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.676
Goodbye, Sam.

26:09.007 --> 26:10.910
Fuck!

26:10.942 --> 26:12.310
Ce n'est pas assez blanc.

26:12.344 --> 26:14.680
It's still not
fucking white enough.

26:14.713 --> 26:17.315
Sorry about that, Josée.

26:17.348 --> 26:20.952
You look
white enough to me, kid.

26:20.986 --> 26:23.022
Papa, what are you doing here?

26:23.055 --> 26:25.024
I just came to see
my favourite daughter.

26:25.056 --> 26:26.825
Perfect.
You can take me to lunch,

26:26.859 --> 26:28.361
tell me all about
your life going to shit.

26:28.393 --> 26:30.228
Sounds lovely.

26:30.261 --> 26:32.264
Alex, I'm taking lunch with my
father, and when I get back,

26:32.297 --> 26:34.834
you need to figure out
the motherfucking, cocksucking,

26:34.866 --> 26:36.768
not fucking white
enough fucking problem!

26:36.802 --> 26:38.938
Okay, Josée.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.707
Josée, you don't need to
use that kind of language.

26:40.739 --> 26:41.807
It's lazy.

26:41.841 --> 26:44.010
No, Papa, it's not lazy,
it's these fucking assholes

26:44.043 --> 26:45.812
that I'm working with
that are lazy. Huh?

26:45.844 --> 26:49.015
Ahh, okay.
Do you want to go like that

26:49.047 --> 26:50.215
or should we change?

26:50.248 --> 26:51.851
Just give me
five minutes, okay?

26:51.883 --> 26:53.152
Okay.

27:20.478 --> 27:21.780
Did you like it?

27:21.814 --> 27:23.882
No. I thought it was terrible.

27:23.915 --> 27:25.417
Shut up.

27:25.450 --> 27:27.353
You're the one who's terrible.

27:27.385 --> 27:31.257
No, I liked it, I did...
what I saw of it.

27:31.289 --> 27:33.392
It's about the horror
of marriage.

27:33.424 --> 27:36.796
Yeah, I picked up
on that subtle thread.

27:36.828 --> 27:40.432
Mother says you caught
Linda with another man.

27:40.466 --> 27:43.069
What?
Your mother knows?

27:43.102 --> 27:44.871
Of course she knows.

27:44.903 --> 27:48.406
God, I specifically told
Layton not to say anything.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.509
I'm surprised you remember
anything you said to Layton.

27:51.611 --> 27:55.281
Is there no respect
for frailty in this family?

27:55.314 --> 27:57.048
No respect for personal
confidence whatsoever for...

27:57.082 --> 27:58.985
- Bienvenue.
- Oh, Jesus Christ almighty!

27:59.017 --> 28:00.886
Est-ce que tout va bien?

28:00.920 --> 28:03.156
Yeah, you just gave me
a surprise, that's all.

28:03.189 --> 28:05.892
Not to worry. Come this way.

28:08.026 --> 28:09.295
Are you sure you're okay?

28:09.327 --> 28:11.363
Yeah, everything's fine.

28:11.396 --> 28:13.365
So, what else did she say?

28:13.399 --> 28:15.101
She laughed.

28:15.133 --> 28:17.970
She laughed?

28:20.538 --> 28:23.241
Your server will
be here soon.

28:23.275 --> 28:24.977
Can I get you a drink?

28:25.009 --> 28:28.948
Um...
Just water.

28:28.980 --> 28:33.051
A glass
of white wine, please.

28:33.084 --> 28:36.288
So, what else did she say?

28:36.322 --> 28:39.125
That was pretty much it.

28:39.158 --> 28:42.328
She told me you caught
Linda with another man,

28:42.361 --> 28:47.033
that you were getting another
divorce, and then she laughed.

28:47.065 --> 28:48.834
But she did laugh a lot,

28:48.867 --> 28:51.303
and for a long time,
so you know she cares.

28:51.336 --> 28:53.472
Oh, of course.

28:57.343 --> 28:59.845
Do you ever
think about your life?

28:59.879 --> 29:02.949
What you've done,
what you haven't done,

29:04.315 --> 29:07.119
the kind of man
that you wanted to be?

29:07.151 --> 29:08.120
Um, no.

29:08.152 --> 29:10.856
But then again,
I'm an 18-year-old woman, so...

29:10.890 --> 29:13.191
Yeah, of course.

29:13.225 --> 29:16.462
Was I a good father?

29:16.495 --> 29:19.065
I mean, I know...
I know I had shortcomings,

29:19.097 --> 29:21.967
but the big picture?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.369
Well, you could
have been around more,

29:24.402 --> 29:29.041
a lot more,
especially after the divorce.

29:30.976 --> 29:33.012
Not for me.
I'm more like you -

29:33.045 --> 29:36.248
I can take it.
But for Layton.

29:36.282 --> 29:38.284
He's always been
such a fucking pussy.

29:38.316 --> 29:41.019
Oh, God, do you have to talk
about your brother like that?

29:41.053 --> 29:45.358
The language that comes out
of your mouth sometimes...

29:45.391 --> 29:47.093
I blame your mother.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.526
She always swore
like a fucking sailor.

29:48.559 --> 29:50.262
Well, she blames you.

29:50.296 --> 29:51.463
Yeah.

29:51.497 --> 29:52.664
So, you're even.

29:53.766 --> 29:55.500
Now, is there anything else
you need to tell me?

29:55.534 --> 29:59.505
No, just another
d-i-v-o-r-c-e...

29:59.537 --> 30:01.207
Et voila.

30:01.239 --> 30:04.107
- Thank you.
- Avec plaisir.

30:04.109 --> 30:06.946
No wine? No whisky?

30:06.978 --> 30:08.314
What's the occasion?

30:08.346 --> 30:11.349
I-I just thought
I'd cut down a bit.

30:11.382 --> 30:13.987
It's not a terrible idea.

30:15.653 --> 30:17.690
Yeah.

30:17.722 --> 30:21.092
So, what about you?
You have any other news?

30:21.125 --> 30:24.296
Not much.
I have a new boyfriend.

30:24.330 --> 30:26.399
- Oh.
- Yep.

30:26.431 --> 30:28.366
God, everybody's
got boyfriends -

30:28.400 --> 30:32.371
Layton, Linda...

30:32.403 --> 30:35.641
Linda...

30:35.673 --> 30:38.344
how could she do this to me?

30:38.376 --> 30:41.012
I don't know, Dad.

30:41.046 --> 30:43.615
Maybe because she's
a fucking idiot. Hmm?

30:43.649 --> 30:45.084
Yeah.

30:45.116 --> 30:49.187
Maybe. Yeah.

30:52.257 --> 30:54.727
So, what we are looking at is an
Astrocytoma tumour, Grade 4.

30:54.759 --> 30:59.097
It's a glioblastoma multiforme,
that is covering

30:59.131 --> 31:01.600
and exerting pressure
on both the frontal

31:01.632 --> 31:05.203
and the temporal lobes.

31:05.237 --> 31:07.038
Hmm. Is it...

31:07.072 --> 31:10.042
is that what's causing
the hallucinations?

31:10.075 --> 31:12.111
I don't know, Sam.

31:12.143 --> 31:14.380
I can do more tests
and try to find out,

31:14.412 --> 31:18.584
But what I do know,
now, for sure, is that...

31:18.616 --> 31:21.052
this is one of the largest
tumours I've ever seen,

31:21.085 --> 31:24.690
and it's growing on
the parts of your brain

31:24.722 --> 31:28.760
responsible for thought,
reasoning, behaviour,

31:28.794 --> 31:31.464
memory, hearing,

31:31.497 --> 31:34.033
vision, and emotion.

31:34.065 --> 31:36.736
Hm. Well, that's a relief.

31:36.768 --> 31:39.072
I hardly ever
use any of that stuff.

31:42.074 --> 31:46.112
So...
So, what's the solution?

31:48.380 --> 31:51.383
It's way too close
to the brain to operate.

31:51.417 --> 31:55.488
If we had caught it earlier...

31:55.520 --> 32:00.026
But... what is
the solution, Doctor?

32:02.126 --> 32:04.029
I won't lie to you, Sam -

32:04.063 --> 32:07.700
this tumour is only going to get
bigger, and bigger,

32:07.732 --> 32:09.467
then, most probably, you...

32:09.500 --> 32:11.738
well, you're going to die.

32:15.774 --> 32:18.678
Oh.

32:22.547 --> 32:25.550
When?

32:25.584 --> 32:28.554
A couple months,
maybe a year,

32:28.586 --> 32:32.392
but not much
longer than that.

32:37.161 --> 32:41.467
So... there's no... hope?

32:43.768 --> 32:47.238
Well, radiation therapy could
possibly give you more time.

32:47.271 --> 32:50.341
But in the best cases, the
long-term survival rates

32:50.374 --> 32:55.180
for that type of cancer
is about three percent.

32:57.216 --> 33:00.252
And you're not one
of the best cases.

33:00.285 --> 33:03.689
Oh.

33:52.571 --> 33:56.442
Well, well, well,
look what the cat's dragging in.

33:56.475 --> 33:58.144
Happy thanksgiving.

33:58.177 --> 34:00.446
Happy thanksgiving to you.

34:00.478 --> 34:02.748
Where's the lovely Linda?

34:02.780 --> 34:04.916
Working on her abs?

34:04.950 --> 34:08.154
No, she's working at
somebody else's abs.

34:08.187 --> 34:10.855
Oh...
Oh, oh, sorry.

34:10.888 --> 34:14.727
Oh, come here,
you stupid man.

34:23.868 --> 34:25.270
Sorry.

34:25.303 --> 34:26.805
I'm okay.

34:26.837 --> 34:28.207
Yeah?

34:28.239 --> 34:29.408
I'm okay.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.178
Come on in.

34:32.210 --> 34:33.946
Hey, guys.

34:33.978 --> 34:35.614
- Hey.
- Look who's here.

34:35.647 --> 34:37.248
Hey.

34:37.281 --> 34:38.450
What the fuck
happened to you?

34:38.482 --> 34:39.919
Ah, you know,
just part of the game.

34:39.951 --> 34:41.654
Should I be worried about you?

34:41.687 --> 34:43.489
No, you should be worried
about the other guy,

34:43.522 --> 34:45.525
'cause I knocked that
little bitch out cold.

34:46.558 --> 34:49.495
Hey. Oh.

34:49.527 --> 34:52.598
Papa, this is Chad.

34:52.631 --> 34:55.600
And Chad, this is my dad,
who teaches poetry.

34:55.634 --> 34:57.969
Get it, guys?

34:58.002 --> 35:00.271
Yeah, it's hilarious.
Nice to meet you, Chad.

35:00.305 --> 35:01.339
Thanks.

35:01.372 --> 35:04.842
Can you get me a large,
man-sized whiskey, please?

35:04.875 --> 35:06.444
I thought you were
taking a break.

35:06.477 --> 35:08.213
Well, in the words of
the immortal bard,

35:08.247 --> 35:09.714
"That was then, this is now."

35:09.747 --> 35:10.815
It's your funeral.

35:10.848 --> 35:14.754
Sure is.
Yep, it sure is.

35:21.826 --> 35:23.328
Good old S.E. Hinton.

35:23.361 --> 35:25.597
Yeah.

35:25.631 --> 35:28.933
Yeah, I always had
a soft spot for her.

35:28.966 --> 35:30.935
Me, too.

35:30.968 --> 35:34.505
I love The Outsiders,
Rumble Fish.

35:34.538 --> 35:38.310
I mean,
I even think Tex is good.

35:38.343 --> 35:40.446
Hmm. Book or movie?

35:40.478 --> 35:42.547
Movies are great,
don't get me wrong,

35:42.580 --> 35:43.881
especially Rumble Fish.

35:43.915 --> 35:46.919
But I'm more a book man myself.

35:46.951 --> 35:48.453
Hmm. Book man.

35:48.486 --> 35:51.756
Yes, sir.

35:51.790 --> 35:53.892
I'm studying at McGill, English.

35:53.924 --> 35:56.928
I'm actually gonna be taking
your class next semester.

35:56.962 --> 36:00.299
Listen, she's invited you
to Thanksgiving dinner.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.734
Don't give me the bullshit.

36:01.767 --> 36:03.736
No, sir.

36:03.768 --> 36:05.770
I'm really interested in
Canadian poetry, yeah, honest.

36:05.803 --> 36:07.772
I want to be a writer one day.

36:07.806 --> 36:11.910
Oh, God. Just when things
seem to be going so well...

36:12.910 --> 36:15.847
I'm serious.
It's all I ever wanted to do.

36:15.881 --> 36:18.017
Hmm.

36:18.049 --> 36:20.585
And here we are -
one man-sized whiskey, full.

36:20.618 --> 36:23.922
A woman's work
is never done.

36:25.056 --> 36:26.924
Death to the patriarchy.

36:26.957 --> 36:28.426
Death to the patriarchy.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.296
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:30.328 --> 36:32.664
So, they barricaded
themselves into my office

36:32.698 --> 36:34.533
and vowed not to leave.

36:34.565 --> 36:36.834
The director wanted me to call
the police, but I said, "No."

36:36.868 --> 36:38.770
I ordered them pizza.

36:38.803 --> 36:40.738
I told the security guards
to keep an eye on them,

36:40.772 --> 36:42.875
and we all went home
for the weekend.

36:42.908 --> 36:45.576
Monday morning, they were gone.

36:45.609 --> 36:47.512
They left the office spotless,

36:47.546 --> 36:50.515
except one of them had left the
a massive shit in my bathroom.

36:50.549 --> 36:52.785
I mean, that's it,
that's the only protest.

36:52.817 --> 36:56.854
And that's what you get for
being dean at a law school.

36:56.888 --> 36:58.556
So, what were your friends
protesting this time?

36:58.589 --> 36:59.792
Big changes on Facebook?

36:59.825 --> 37:01.326
Sadly, we can't all be cogs

37:01.359 --> 37:03.495
in the neo-liberal
capitalist war machine!

37:03.527 --> 37:05.064
I play hockey.
So, what does that have to do

37:05.096 --> 37:06.497
with neo-liberal whatever?

37:06.531 --> 37:08.033
Bread and circuses,
dear brother.

37:08.065 --> 37:10.468
They call the tune,
and you dance on their ice,

37:10.502 --> 37:12.571
like a pretty
little slut puppet.

37:12.603 --> 37:13.772
Okay, you be careful, okay?

37:13.805 --> 37:15.007
No, you be careful, asshole.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.575
There's a fucking war going on.

37:16.607 --> 37:18.609
Enough! Jesus.

37:20.379 --> 37:23.415
Can I ask you something,
Jonathan?

37:23.448 --> 37:26.585
Have you ever
come across a patient

37:26.618 --> 37:29.755
who suddenly starts to
hallucinate things

37:29.788 --> 37:33.359
that you might see in a movie?

37:33.392 --> 37:37.062
Like a lion in a living room,
that sort of thing.

37:37.094 --> 37:39.997
I read a case, a man,

37:40.031 --> 37:42.468
victim of a vicious attack,

37:42.500 --> 37:44.870
he woke from a coma,
suddenly able to solve

37:44.902 --> 37:48.040
the most complicated
mathematical questions.

37:48.073 --> 37:49.908
He was a driving instructor,

37:49.940 --> 37:54.712
had a high school education.

37:54.745 --> 37:58.584
But now, he sees a world of
mathematics everywhere.

37:58.616 --> 38:00.986
The human mind is a strange,

38:01.018 --> 38:03.689
wonderful, terrible thing.

38:03.721 --> 38:06.124
It sure is.

38:12.596 --> 38:14.665
Excuse me for a second.

38:17.002 --> 38:18.637
When is your next game?

38:18.669 --> 38:20.705
Sunday.

38:20.739 --> 38:22.074
Okay.

38:26.844 --> 38:28.013
I could do with one of those.

38:28.046 --> 38:31.884
Jesus!

38:31.917 --> 38:33.518
You nearly gave
me a heart attack.

38:33.551 --> 38:35.586
Sorry.

38:35.620 --> 38:39.558
Now, would that have been ironic
or just a coincidence,

38:39.591 --> 38:41.527
in your professor opinion?

38:41.560 --> 38:44.897
I don't know, Dad.
Maybe just bad luck.

38:44.930 --> 38:48.634
Grand.
How 'bout that drink?

38:48.667 --> 38:51.002
You're a ghost,
why would you want a drink?

38:51.035 --> 38:53.738
Maybe I'm thirsty.

38:53.772 --> 38:57.476
Hmm. Ask a stupid question...

39:00.511 --> 39:02.747
Here you go.

39:07.018 --> 39:10.889
Well, seems like I'm gonna die.

39:10.922 --> 39:13.158
Yeah, heard about that.

39:13.190 --> 39:15.727
From your bony friend
in the next room?

39:17.928 --> 39:19.831
Word is out on the street.

39:21.732 --> 39:23.067
What's it like?

39:23.100 --> 39:26.037
It's like any other street,
just a bit more ghostly.

39:26.071 --> 39:28.841
Dying. What's dying like?

39:28.873 --> 39:30.509
What's sex like?

39:30.542 --> 39:34.212
Or being in love?
Or the snow falling?

39:34.245 --> 39:37.715
I don't remember you
being so poetic or so cagey.

39:37.748 --> 39:39.718
Well, the kid questions -

39:39.750 --> 39:41.652
the moon is made of cheese,

39:41.685 --> 39:45.690
storks bring babies -
it's not so tough.

39:45.723 --> 39:47.658
And what about Mom?

39:47.692 --> 39:50.228
How can you not know
why Mom left you?

39:50.261 --> 39:54.098
I mean, what kind of a man
doesn't know that?

39:54.131 --> 39:56.067
It's tricky, son,

39:56.100 --> 39:59.570
to know what's in
another person's heart.

40:02.674 --> 40:05.244
Drinking alone,
you know what they say?

40:05.277 --> 40:08.614
Yep. I know,
I've got a problem.

40:08.647 --> 40:12.116
I'm sure it's nothing
you can't handle.

40:14.118 --> 40:16.954
But if you need any help with
it, Samuel, I do know people.

40:16.988 --> 40:20.792
I'll be okay,
but thanks.

40:20.825 --> 40:23.761
Good. Okay.

40:23.794 --> 40:28.700
Well, I also wanted
to tell you, um,

40:28.732 --> 40:31.135
we're going to make an
announcement before dessert,

40:31.169 --> 40:35.140
Jonathan has asked me
to marry him,

40:35.172 --> 40:37.877
and I said yes.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.313
God...

40:43.814 --> 40:45.950
I just wanted to tell you.

40:45.984 --> 40:48.252
Oh. Oh, that's...

40:48.285 --> 40:51.889
That's...
That's great news.

40:51.922 --> 40:53.325
I'm really happy for you.

40:53.357 --> 40:55.294
Thank you.

40:57.227 --> 41:02.099
And I always thought you looked
really, really sexy in white.

41:02.132 --> 41:04.268
Okay.

41:04.301 --> 41:05.903
- Really.
- Yeah.

41:05.937 --> 41:09.908
What the fuck?
You must be fucking kidding me.

41:09.940 --> 41:11.310
Just in case you're not...

41:11.343 --> 41:13.344
Oh!

41:13.377 --> 41:14.745
Grow the fuck up.

41:16.614 --> 41:18.817
You really blew it
when you let that one go.

41:18.850 --> 41:21.886
Shut the fuck up, Dad.

42:29.087 --> 42:30.222
Hey, Mr. O'Shea.

42:30.254 --> 42:31.756
Fuck off.

42:31.790 --> 42:34.726
Hey, Mr. O'Shea,
it's me, it's Chad.

42:34.759 --> 42:36.161
Chad, Josée's boyfriend
from Thanksgiving.

42:36.194 --> 42:37.663
Oh, Chad!

42:37.696 --> 42:38.596
Yeah.

42:38.631 --> 42:41.966
It's you!
Oh, it's good to see you, man.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.902
Oh! She's not here, is she?

42:43.935 --> 42:45.270
No, she's at home.

42:45.303 --> 42:47.372
I lost everything.

42:47.404 --> 42:49.874
So, don't you
go down that path.

42:49.908 --> 42:52.044
No, don't worry, okay?
I love her.

42:52.076 --> 42:53.844
I'll do the
right thing, I promise.

42:53.877 --> 42:55.881
This'll fix you
right up, huh?

43:10.027 --> 43:13.230
So, it's only after
he gets back from Thailand,

43:13.263 --> 43:15.066
that his dad, right,

43:15.100 --> 43:17.868
his dead dad starts to
appear to him as a ghost,

43:17.902 --> 43:21.006
and he starts to talk
to him about life

43:21.038 --> 43:23.475
and death and everything,

43:23.507 --> 43:25.410
and they even start
to work their shit out.

43:25.442 --> 43:28.946
But then, his old drug
connections, you know,

43:28.980 --> 43:32.718
they come back, they...
to track him down, you know?

43:32.750 --> 43:33.919
Yeah.

43:33.951 --> 43:35.120
Mm.

43:35.152 --> 43:38.055
My died when I was...
when I was young...

43:38.089 --> 43:40.092
Oh.

43:40.125 --> 43:43.195
...younger than... than you are.

43:44.261 --> 43:49.200
You know, it was
fucking terrible

43:49.234 --> 43:51.268
because you're...

43:51.301 --> 43:55.006
you're just so alone.

43:55.038 --> 43:57.308
You know?
Do you find that?

43:57.341 --> 44:00.945
Yeah. Well, no.

44:00.978 --> 44:03.281
I mean, my...
my dad's still alive.

44:03.314 --> 44:06.118
It's only in the book
that he's dead, so...

44:06.151 --> 44:07.786
You know something?

44:07.819 --> 44:11.922
I've always wanted
to write a book...

44:11.955 --> 44:13.491
about all the crazy
fucking things

44:13.524 --> 44:14.992
that have
happened in my life.

44:15.026 --> 44:19.297
But then, you know,
marriage, divorce, kids,

44:19.330 --> 44:21.199
and, I'll tell you,

44:21.232 --> 44:24.302
teaching other people's
fucking books, man.

44:24.335 --> 44:27.305
and I never seem to be
able to get around to it,

44:27.337 --> 44:32.276
and it's the one fucking thing
I have always wanted to do. I...

44:44.888 --> 44:46.056
Holy fuck.

44:51.895 --> 44:54.932
You must follow
your dreams, Samuel.

44:54.966 --> 44:58.170
You must follow them home.

44:58.203 --> 44:59.772
Yeah.

45:03.174 --> 45:05.143
Yeah.

45:05.176 --> 45:06.944
See you later.

45:06.977 --> 45:10.147
Huh? Yeah.
You gonna be okay?

45:10.181 --> 45:12.785
Yeah, I'll be fine.

45:17.888 --> 45:18.856
Listen, Brendan,

45:18.890 --> 45:21.926
thanks for looking after
the old place for me.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.261
It's my pleasure.

45:23.294 --> 45:25.096
Should I teach
your classes, too?

45:25.129 --> 45:26.897
Oh, that'd be great.

45:26.931 --> 45:28.834
I've just finished Milton Acorn,

45:28.866 --> 45:30.901
about to start on
Margaret Atwood.

45:30.935 --> 45:32.536
Perfect. Love Margaret.

45:32.569 --> 45:35.172
It's my favourite Atwood
of all the Atwoods.

45:35.205 --> 45:38.042
Anything else that
I should tell the kids?

45:38.076 --> 45:39.277
Oh, I don't know.

45:39.310 --> 45:41.946
Tell them to look both ways
before they cross the street.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.481
Words to live by.

45:43.513 --> 45:46.017
Yeah.

45:46.049 --> 45:48.586
Well, you're Ireland's
problem now.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.422
Safe travels, old friend.

45:54.893 --> 45:56.562
Safe travels.

How've you been?

47:51.042 --> 47:54.746
Grand. How was the flight?

47:54.779 --> 47:57.215
Bumpy. Yours?

47:57.247 --> 47:58.649
Heavenly. Thanks.

47:58.683 --> 48:00.719
That's terrible.

48:00.752 --> 48:03.087
You'd imagine
with all your free time,

48:03.120 --> 48:05.155
you'd come up with
better material.

48:05.189 --> 48:06.757
Well, you know what they say -

48:06.790 --> 48:10.227
dying's easy, comedy's hard.

48:10.261 --> 48:11.396
Clearly.

48:11.428 --> 48:14.031
Come on,
we'll get you settled.

48:43.194 --> 48:47.132
So, what are we doing here?

48:47.165 --> 48:49.433
Me? I'm, uh...

48:51.301 --> 48:53.203
I'm reflecting on my life,

48:53.236 --> 48:55.172
my imminent death,

48:55.205 --> 48:58.642
and I'm writing the great
North American novel.

48:58.676 --> 49:01.679
You. I have no fucking idea.

49:01.712 --> 49:05.683
Writing a book.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

49:05.716 --> 49:09.120
Are you even stupider
than I thought?

49:09.152 --> 49:11.156
Probably.

49:11.189 --> 49:13.757
This is good, Dad. Mmm.
Your cooking has improved.

49:13.790 --> 49:15.493
What are you
talking about?

49:15.526 --> 49:18.495
I was always
good in the kitchen.

49:18.529 --> 49:22.167
We used to eat this all
the time. Don't you remember?

49:22.200 --> 49:24.502
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

49:24.535 --> 49:26.171
I remember everything, Dad.

49:27.839 --> 49:31.410
You and me, the old house
in Dublin, and here.

49:34.111 --> 49:37.214
You know, when...

49:37.247 --> 49:39.283
Geneviève and I got divorced,

49:39.317 --> 49:41.186
and it was just
me and the kids...

49:43.254 --> 49:46.690
...I really started to
think about you and me,

49:46.723 --> 49:49.460
and growing up without mom.

49:52.529 --> 49:57.334
And how the one thing that
I never wanted to happen,

49:57.368 --> 50:02.107
'cause I knew that it
brought such a trouble,

50:02.140 --> 50:05.442
a broken family,

50:05.475 --> 50:07.812
that's the one
thing that happened,

50:12.616 --> 50:14.352
You know, it's a funny thing,
this life.

50:16.319 --> 50:18.489
Even with all the heart aches,
you wouldn't change a thing.

50:18.522 --> 50:21.225
I wouldn't have changed a thing,

50:21.259 --> 50:23.762
not a single moment with you.

50:25.763 --> 50:28.132
Riding your bike.

50:29.466 --> 50:31.635
Putting some little
picture on the wall.

50:36.741 --> 50:40.277
Except, of course, dying,
and leaving you all on your own.

50:42.580 --> 50:44.216
My darling boy.

50:48.319 --> 50:52.491
It's okay, Dad. It's okay.

50:54.192 --> 50:55.494
Thanks.

51:50.547 --> 51:52.350
Hello.

51:52.382 --> 51:53.585
Bonjour.

51:54.618 --> 51:56.954
Oh, you're French.

51:58.888 --> 52:01.526
French-Canadian.
Is that a problem?

52:01.558 --> 52:03.794
No, it's just...

52:03.828 --> 52:06.698
Do you ever get the feeling
that God is laughing at you?

52:06.730 --> 52:09.734
All the time.
What's today's punchline?

52:09.767 --> 52:11.835
Well, I just got off
the plane from Montreal,

52:11.868 --> 52:14.471
and here you are,
reading Leonard Cohen.

52:14.504 --> 52:18.508
Is this the part where we say,
"It's a small world"?

52:18.542 --> 52:21.411
Exactly.
God, it's a small world.

52:21.444 --> 52:23.647
Sure is.

52:23.681 --> 52:25.884
Are you, uh,
are you enjoying this?

52:27.384 --> 52:30.921
Yeah, I am. It's trippy.

52:30.955 --> 52:33.391
'60s people,
they liked it trippy.

52:33.424 --> 52:35.326
They sure did.

52:35.359 --> 52:38.563
Personally I've always been
a big fan of The Favourite Game.

52:38.596 --> 52:40.298
Is that so?

52:40.330 --> 52:42.834
That is so. In fact, you could
say it's my favourite.

52:47.471 --> 52:49.306
First God, and now
your hilarious gags.

52:49.339 --> 52:51.308
We're just having
ourselves a laugh riot.

52:51.341 --> 52:53.544
Yeah, we sure are.

52:53.576 --> 52:56.680
Mind if I ask you, like,

52:56.714 --> 52:58.850
what are you...
what are you doing here?

52:58.882 --> 53:03.388
Don't mind.
I ask myself that every day.

53:03.421 --> 53:04.555
And?

53:04.587 --> 53:07.557
And my mother's
Irish from nearby.

53:07.591 --> 53:10.495
She bought herself this
shop for something to do.

53:10.527 --> 53:11.995
And you?

53:12.029 --> 53:15.833
I have an old shack
by the sea. It's been years.

53:15.866 --> 53:19.036
I just thought I'd come and
look at the old place.

53:19.069 --> 53:21.772
See what's changed.

53:21.806 --> 53:26.644
I predict you'll find
everything exactly the same.

53:26.676 --> 53:30.948
Could be worse. I've had quite
a few changes lately.

53:30.980 --> 53:32.015
There you go.

53:32.049 --> 53:33.551
Thank you.

53:34.785 --> 53:35.886
Good luck with the sea.

53:35.919 --> 53:37.755
Enjoy the book.

53:49.834 --> 53:53.705
So, the big moment
has finally arrived, Dad.

53:56.140 --> 53:58.542
What happened
between you and Mum?

54:02.913 --> 54:04.916
I never wanted much.

54:06.884 --> 54:09.554
Wife, family.

54:09.587 --> 54:12.790
Decent job with decent pay.

54:12.823 --> 54:15.593
That the British Empire
had never existed.

54:17.093 --> 54:19.630
My needs were simple.

54:20.765 --> 54:22.734
But her needs...

54:24.968 --> 54:26.737
They were a little
more like yours.

54:28.138 --> 54:31.007
What the hell do you know
about my needs?

54:31.040 --> 54:32.977
Jesus, boy.

54:35.478 --> 54:37.415
Anyone could take
one look at you

54:37.448 --> 54:40.651
and know all
about your needs.

54:40.683 --> 54:43.087
Just like your mother.

54:44.788 --> 54:47.959
And those needs, they were
more important than me,

54:47.991 --> 54:49.893
than you, than anyone.

54:52.062 --> 54:54.399
And she followed those needs
and we never saw her again,

54:54.431 --> 54:55.834
and that's what happened.

54:58.669 --> 55:00.672
But, dear God,
I loved that woman.

55:03.107 --> 55:04.542
Jeez.

55:06.210 --> 55:09.514
That's a bit depressing.

55:09.547 --> 55:11.682
Hits too close to home.

55:11.714 --> 55:13.417
The truth often does.

55:16.219 --> 55:18.122
As a somewhat
all-knowing ghost,

55:18.154 --> 55:21.892
what do you think
it means, Dad?

55:21.926 --> 55:24.462
I'll leave that one
to you, son.

55:24.495 --> 55:26.864
Good.

55:26.897 --> 55:28.799
I have
no fucking idea.

55:33.671 --> 55:35.672
And I'm not
like my mother.

55:39.042 --> 55:41.011
I'm nothing
like my mother.

56:07.971 --> 56:12.709
Excuse me.
Do you have hockey sticks?

56:12.743 --> 56:16.781
Oh, I'm sorry.
We just sold the last one.

56:16.814 --> 56:19.216
Too bad.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.918
Actually, that was
just a clever ruse to

56:20.951 --> 56:22.587
get to talk to you again.

56:22.620 --> 56:26.089
Oh, what was it that you
wanted to talk about, again?

56:26.122 --> 56:28.859
Why don't we start
with the basics?

56:28.893 --> 56:30.761
What's your favourite colour?

56:32.663 --> 56:34.498
You have done this before,
haven't you?

56:34.531 --> 56:36.968
Oh, yeah. Many, many times.
I'm kind of an operator.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.102
Wow.

56:39.136 --> 56:42.273
Well, in that case, yellow.

56:42.306 --> 56:44.642
What's next, Mr. Operator?

56:44.674 --> 56:47.245
Well, now we get to
know each other through

56:47.277 --> 56:49.680
charming conversation.
You ask me a question.

56:49.712 --> 56:51.649
- What's your favourite colour?
- I don't have one.

56:51.681 --> 56:53.584
Man of mystery, wow.

56:53.616 --> 56:56.086
This just keeps getting
better and better.

56:56.120 --> 56:58.122
What could possibly be next?

56:58.154 --> 57:00.725
I think that's it
for conversation.

57:00.757 --> 57:02.192
Oh, no.

57:02.225 --> 57:03.861
Well, yeah. I think we've
covered all the basics,

57:03.893 --> 57:05.830
all we need to know
about each other.

57:05.863 --> 57:08.165
Well, what about
your favourite vegetable?

57:08.198 --> 57:10.801
Your astrological sign?
Your name?

57:10.834 --> 57:13.004
Samuel O'Shea.

57:13.036 --> 57:15.239
Charlotte LaFleur.

57:15.272 --> 57:17.241
It's nice to meet you,
Charlotte.

57:17.274 --> 57:20.545
And now that we're so
well-acquainted,

57:20.578 --> 57:25.049
would you like to go for
a drink with me sometime?

57:25.082 --> 57:27.919
Why not? Let's go!

57:27.951 --> 57:29.986
But don't you have to
look after the shop?

57:30.020 --> 57:31.222
Fuck no.

57:35.091 --> 57:37.861
So, what did you do
back in old New York?

57:37.895 --> 57:42.132
A lot really. I modelled forever
and then came my thirties,

57:42.165 --> 57:45.602
and that dried up,
so I took my bags of model cash

57:45.636 --> 57:48.005
and I opened
a restaurant with friends.

57:48.038 --> 57:52.577
And then my mom got sick,
and now here I am.

57:55.212 --> 57:57.047
Hello, Charlotte.

57:57.080 --> 58:00.283
Hello, Kevin. How are things?

58:00.317 --> 58:02.219
Things are grand.

58:02.252 --> 58:04.020
Who's this then?

58:04.053 --> 58:06.223
Sam O'Shea,
nice to meet you.

58:18.134 --> 58:20.671
Well, this has been nice,
but bye, now.

58:22.239 --> 58:23.875
Bye, now.

58:28.044 --> 58:30.313
Who was that?

58:30.346 --> 58:33.618
Just a friend from the shop.

58:33.651 --> 58:36.187
So, uh...
so where were we?

58:36.219 --> 58:40.390
- Bags of model cash.
- Bags of model cash.

58:40.424 --> 58:42.026
So, are you gonna get
the next drink then.

58:42.058 --> 58:46.730
Absolutely, but I should
get home to Mother.

58:46.763 --> 58:50.233
Can I, um,
can I give you a lift?

58:50.267 --> 58:54.272
No, I've got the van,
but this has been fun.

58:56.105 --> 58:58.209
Really fun.

58:58.241 --> 58:59.877
Thanks, Samuel O'Shea.

58:59.910 --> 59:03.814

you know,

1:02:59.582 --> 1:03:02.118
your mom,
she's complicated.

1:03:03.386 --> 1:03:04.955
Yeah, and he's an asshole.

1:03:04.988 --> 1:03:08.058
A fucking asshole,
leaving us like that.

1:03:08.091 --> 1:03:11.094
Sure babe, but your dad,

1:03:11.127 --> 1:03:13.296
you know, he's complicated.

1:03:15.665 --> 1:03:18.368

1:03:18.402 --> 1:03:21.272

1:03:21.305 --> 1:03:24.274
The stupid heroin,
you're always stupid smoking.

1:03:26.643 --> 1:03:28.346
what's it really like?

1:03:30.279 --> 1:03:32.181
It's really like...

1:03:32.214 --> 1:03:35.151
Like God
has a velvet tongue,

1:03:35.185 --> 1:03:39.957
and he's licking you all over,
cause he loves you so much,

1:03:39.989 --> 1:03:42.660
cause you're
so freaking awesome.

1:03:46.163 --> 1:03:47.331
Yeah?

1:03:47.364 --> 1:03:48.599
Hm.

1:03:50.968 --> 1:03:52.969
Well then,
I guess I better try.

1:03:54.437 --> 1:03:56.940
That's my girl.

1:04:08.018 --> 1:04:10.654
Now, you just...

1:04:10.687 --> 1:04:14.991
breathe... it... in.

1:04:30.073 --> 1:04:31.208
Mm.

1:04:39.515 --> 1:04:41.518
Oh, my...

1:04:48.692 --> 1:04:51.395
Oh, God.

1:04:51.428 --> 1:04:54.031
What's wrong?

1:04:54.064 --> 1:04:57.768
I just...
I don't know where to go next.

1:04:57.801 --> 1:05:01.739
I mean, I can feel the ending,
I just can't see it.

1:05:01.772 --> 1:05:03.741
Why don't you go for a walk?

1:05:03.774 --> 1:05:06.009
Stir up those
creative juices.

1:05:06.042 --> 1:05:08.544
Yeah, yeah.

1:05:08.578 --> 1:05:11.282
That's...
That's not a terrible idea.

1:05:19.156 --> 1:05:21.525
Jesus Christ!

1:05:23.593 --> 1:05:25.261
Oh, my God.

1:05:26.696 --> 1:05:28.565
Get your coat, let's go.

1:05:28.598 --> 1:05:30.034
Where?

1:05:30.067 --> 1:05:31.535
To the police.

1:05:31.567 --> 1:05:34.171
- What for?
- To find out who did this.

1:05:34.203 --> 1:05:36.606
I already know who did it.
It was Kevin.

1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:38.475
Kevin who?

1:05:38.507 --> 1:05:41.344
Kevin from...
Kevin from the pub.

1:05:41.377 --> 1:05:43.247
To tell you the truth,
we had a little thing,

1:05:43.279 --> 1:05:45.214
and he's a little jealous.

1:05:45.247 --> 1:05:47.750
I thought it was settled,
but I'll talk to him again.

1:05:47.783 --> 1:05:49.786
Believe me,
it's better this way.

1:05:49.819 --> 1:05:51.689
I can handle it.

1:05:55.158 --> 1:05:57.194
Okay, okay.

1:05:59.596 --> 1:06:02.498
What do we do with that?

1:06:02.531 --> 1:06:05.568
Better take it to the dump
before the flies get too thick.

1:06:50.147 --> 1:06:51.815
Just leave it.

1:06:51.848 --> 1:06:54.451
Just hang on for a moment.

1:07:00.323 --> 1:07:02.392
What the fuck
do you want old man?

1:07:02.424 --> 1:07:04.428
You left something at my house.

1:07:04.460 --> 1:07:06.395
Go fuck yourself.

1:07:06.428 --> 1:07:08.397
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

1:07:08.431 --> 1:07:12.236
You ever come near me,
my house, or my woman again,

1:07:12.268 --> 1:07:14.872
and you'll be
the one that will be fucked.

1:07:17.506 --> 1:07:19.475
Sam, what are you doing?

1:07:19.509 --> 1:07:21.178
Wants his deer head back.

1:07:24.781 --> 1:07:26.616
Hey, don't touch
the fucking truck.

1:07:26.649 --> 1:07:28.218
Or what? What?

1:07:28.250 --> 1:07:30.553
What the fuck are you
going to do about it?

1:07:33.489 --> 1:07:37.393
Yeah, just like I thought,
you fucking coward.

1:07:52.875 --> 1:07:57.446
Well, well, well, look at you,
Mr. Sexy Professor Man.

1:07:57.480 --> 1:07:59.950
I better get you home
right away.

1:07:59.982 --> 1:08:01.919
So, we hit the ice,
and the first skate 'round,

1:08:01.951 --> 1:08:04.254
the first guy I skate by.

1:08:06.922 --> 1:08:08.591
So, everybody's fighting
and there's blood all over

1:08:08.625 --> 1:08:10.827
the ice. When it's
all done the coach says,

1:08:10.859 --> 1:08:13.196
"What the fuck? What about
winning's the best revenge?"

1:08:13.230 --> 1:08:15.632
And I said, "Well yeah, and we
fucking won, didn't we?"

1:08:15.665 --> 1:08:17.501
Fucking kicked their asses.

1:08:19.803 --> 1:08:22.238
Fuck! Eh?

1:08:28.245 --> 1:08:30.247
I'm sure your
father has a very good reason.

1:08:30.279 --> 1:08:31.648
Whatever that is.

1:08:38.787 --> 1:08:41.757
Bien. Joyeux Noel.
Merry Christmas.

1:08:41.791 --> 1:08:42.793
Cheers.

1:08:42.826 --> 1:08:43.859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:08:43.893 --> 1:08:45.529
Merry Christmas.

1:08:45.562 --> 1:08:47.997
So, you've the two children?

1:08:48.031 --> 1:08:51.801
Josée and Layton.

1:08:51.835 --> 1:08:54.238
Great kids, the best ever.

1:08:54.270 --> 1:08:56.773
Mine too,
though I only had the one,

1:08:56.805 --> 1:08:58.774
my darling
young Charlotte here.

1:08:58.808 --> 1:09:00.544
Mother.

1:09:00.577 --> 1:09:03.547
And how many wives?

1:09:03.580 --> 1:09:07.251
Eh, two, both-
both divorced.

1:09:07.283 --> 1:09:08.852
You got me beat again.

1:09:08.885 --> 1:09:13.591
I only had the one divorce,
and the one marriage, thank God.

1:09:14.890 --> 1:09:16.792
And how old are you now?

1:09:16.826 --> 1:09:18.795
I'm sixty-four.

1:09:18.827 --> 1:09:21.464
You're one ahead
of me again.

1:09:21.497 --> 1:09:24.335
I just turned 63 in November.

1:09:25.568 --> 1:09:27.404
We've so much in common.

1:09:27.437 --> 1:09:29.906
Maybe it's you
and I should be lovers.

1:09:29.938 --> 1:09:32.041
Okay, you are
crossing boundaries

1:09:32.075 --> 1:09:33.943
that should not be crossed.

1:09:33.977 --> 1:09:38.415
What? One last go around
for your poor dying mother.

1:09:38.447 --> 1:09:40.716
Consider it an act of charity.

1:09:40.750 --> 1:09:42.352
This conversation's over.

1:09:42.385 --> 1:09:46.790
Well, truth be told,

1:09:46.822 --> 1:09:50.026
I had an older man after
your father was gone,

1:09:50.059 --> 1:09:54.830
back in Montreal,
and he was a dream.

1:09:54.863 --> 1:09:57.500
He was a bit slow to start,
but once the blaze got going...

1:09:57.533 --> 1:10:01.537
...the fireworks.

1:10:03.505 --> 1:10:06.910
So, fair play and best wishes
to us all for a merry Christmas

1:10:06.943 --> 1:10:08.779
and a happy new year.

1:10:08.812 --> 1:10:10.046
And a happy new year.

1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:14.617
What about this mystery man in
Montreal I've never heard about?

1:10:14.651 --> 1:10:16.886
- What happened to him?
- He died.

1:10:21.457 --> 1:10:24.960
Something I've been
meaning to tell you

1:10:24.993 --> 1:10:29.065
about what I'm really
doing here.

1:10:29.099 --> 1:10:31.368
I think I haven't
told anybody else.

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:33.403
Sounds serious.

1:10:33.435 --> 1:10:37.340
Yeah, it's pretty serious.

1:10:39.408 --> 1:10:40.611
Jesus

1:11:26.755 --> 1:11:28.392
- Let's go.
- Where?

1:11:28.425 --> 1:11:30.093
To the police, like we should've
done in the first place.

1:11:30.126 --> 1:11:31.227
No!
No fucking police.

1:11:31.260 --> 1:11:34.764
Get in the car. I'm not
asking you, I am telling you.

1:11:34.797 --> 1:11:36.399
If you go to the police,
I swear to God,

1:11:36.433 --> 1:11:38.568
- you will never see me again.
- Don't you threaten me.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.636
Don't you make me.

1:12:15.037 --> 1:12:18.674
So, what the hell
am I going to do?

1:12:18.707 --> 1:12:22.879
Still a tough question.

1:12:22.912 --> 1:12:26.917
I can't lose her,
I can't lose another one.

1:12:28.550 --> 1:12:30.953
I just can't.

1:12:30.987 --> 1:12:35.058
You can, and you will.

1:12:35.090 --> 1:12:36.926
Sure, every love affair since
Adam and Eve has ended

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:40.864
the exact the same way.
Someone leaves, or someone dies.

1:12:40.897 --> 1:12:42.732
There's not a goddamn thing you

1:12:42.764 --> 1:12:46.202
or anyone else
can do about that.

1:12:46.236 --> 1:12:50.105
Maybe what you need to
start thinking about...

1:12:50.139 --> 1:12:52.576
is maybe another woman,

1:12:52.608 --> 1:12:54.977
another person,
another anything,

1:12:55.010 --> 1:12:57.080
isn't the answer to every
little last thing

1:12:57.112 --> 1:12:59.515
that's wrong with you.

1:12:59.549 --> 1:13:01.484
Maybe not for you, Dad,

1:13:01.518 --> 1:13:04.988
but for me,
it's all I fucking got.

1:13:05.020 --> 1:13:07.090
I can't lose her.

1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:14.697
Well, good fucking
luck with that then.

1:13:14.730 --> 1:13:16.733
Thanks very
fucking much, Dad.

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:54.638
Oh, Thank God you're here.

1:13:54.670 --> 1:13:56.138
Morning, lazy bones.

1:13:57.607 --> 1:13:59.676
Oh.

1:13:59.709 --> 1:14:02.112
Oh, God,
I love you.

1:14:02.144 --> 1:14:03.679
I love you.

1:14:04.746 --> 1:14:06.749
I love you, too.

1:14:15.257 --> 1:14:17.126
It's my daughter.

1:14:20.229 --> 1:14:22.199
The hell is she doing here?

1:14:25.134 --> 1:14:29.005
Josée, what are you
doing here?

1:14:29.037 --> 1:14:30.739
Papa, are you okay?

1:14:30.773 --> 1:14:34.545
Yeah.
Oh, it's good to see you.

1:14:38.781 --> 1:14:41.318
I want you to meet
the woman I love.

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:47.189
This is Charlotte,

1:14:47.223 --> 1:14:50.794
Charlotte this is Josée,
my favourite daughter.

1:14:50.827 --> 1:14:52.662
Papa, this isn't funny.

1:14:52.694 --> 1:14:55.732
But it's not meant to be funny.

1:14:55.764 --> 1:14:58.233
We love each other.

1:14:58.267 --> 1:15:01.138
Love who, Papa?
There's no one here but us.

1:15:02.772 --> 1:15:06.910
But she's standing right there.
Don't you see her? Look.

1:15:06.943 --> 1:15:08.946
Papa, you're scaring me. Mm-hm.

1:15:12.148 --> 1:15:13.882

1:17:52.841 --> 1:17:54.911
And so I figured,

1:17:54.943 --> 1:17:58.981
why not give the dog's
pain medication a shot?

1:17:59.014 --> 1:18:01.785
And I did.
It was a pretty nice high.

1:18:01.818 --> 1:18:03.319
So, I finished the bottle.

1:18:04.586 --> 1:18:08.190
Yeah, I know.
What a lowlife, eh?

1:18:08.224 --> 1:18:12.495
Anyway, the ex dropped
the dogs off the other day.

1:18:12.528 --> 1:18:15.031
and the dog pain killers?

1:18:15.063 --> 1:18:19.468
Well, they're still on the
kitchen counter next to the sink

1:18:19.501 --> 1:18:22.337
right where they're
supposed to be.

1:18:22.371 --> 1:18:27.109
And me? Well, I'm right
where I'm supposed to be

1:18:27.143 --> 1:18:29.345
thanks to my sobriety.

1:18:29.377 --> 1:18:32.514
and I'm just grateful that I can
be here in the right place

1:18:32.547 --> 1:18:37.487
with you guys.
Thanks for letting me share.

1:18:37.519 --> 1:18:38.921
Thanks, Mike.

1:18:41.523 --> 1:18:46.295
My name is Samuel,
and I'm an alcoholic.

1:18:46.328 --> 1:18:48.031
Samuel.

1:18:48.063 --> 1:18:51.166
Thanks for sharing, Mike.

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:53.603
I really identified with
what you said there

1:18:53.635 --> 1:18:55.904
about being in the right place.

1:18:55.938 --> 1:19:00.243
I've, uh...

1:19:00.276 --> 1:19:03.813
I've just come from my
daughter's bedside, and, uh...

1:19:05.881 --> 1:19:09.184
it seems she was
strung out on heroin,

1:19:09.218 --> 1:19:12.154
and I didn't notice...

1:19:14.389 --> 1:19:19.128
because I was too busy being a
selfish alcoholic asshole.

1:19:30.639 --> 1:19:35.177
What a lovely surprise for me,
your favourite daughter!

1:19:38.046 --> 1:19:40.983
I was calling you from
the restaurant for 45 minutes.

1:19:41.017 --> 1:19:43.318
You didn't answer.

1:19:43.352 --> 1:19:47.322
Oh, was that today, our lunch?

1:19:47.355 --> 1:19:50.559
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

1:19:50.593 --> 1:19:55.331
I've been so caught up with
the new show, and school.

1:19:55.363 --> 1:19:59.035
It's been so crazy. I'm sorry.

1:20:02.571 --> 1:20:05.007
Why don't you come with me?

1:20:05.041 --> 1:20:07.677
No, no, no, no.
You run along.

1:20:07.710 --> 1:20:09.279
- We'll catch up later.
- Come on, my love.

1:20:09.312 --> 1:20:11.046
We can still lunch after.
No. Papa, papa, papa.

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.982
Please, please.

1:20:13.014 --> 1:20:14.483
Come with me, my love.
Come on.

1:20:14.517 --> 1:20:15.952
Papa, please.

1:20:15.984 --> 1:20:18.020
Come with me, my love.
Come on.

1:20:18.054 --> 1:20:19.989
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:20:20.022 --> 1:20:21.892
I'll take you home.
Come on.

1:20:23.693 --> 1:20:26.362
Hey!
Hey, what the fuck man!

1:20:26.394 --> 1:20:29.398
You ever go near her again,
I'll fucking bury you.

1:20:38.373 --> 1:20:39.608
Fuck.

1:20:43.979 --> 1:20:45.982
She still looks
the same as the day

1:20:46.014 --> 1:20:47.549
we brought her home.

1:20:50.118 --> 1:20:52.455
I can see all
the days in her face.

1:20:55.157 --> 1:20:57.360
Oh, my poor darling.

1:20:59.161 --> 1:21:02.598
It's my fault.
I should have known.

1:21:02.630 --> 1:21:04.566
I should have noticed.

1:21:04.599 --> 1:21:08.203
No. Me, too.
As soon as she's rested,

1:21:08.237 --> 1:21:10.239
we're gonna get
her the best help.

1:21:12.541 --> 1:21:14.477
She's gonna be alright.

1:21:15.577 --> 1:21:17.013
Yeah.

1:21:20.715 --> 1:21:24.219
I guess I should be going.
It's getting late.

1:21:24.252 --> 1:21:25.487
Yeah.

1:21:29.190 --> 1:21:32.127
Goodnight, my dear.

1:21:54.349 --> 1:21:57.687
I am going to slowly beat
the living shit out of him

1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:01.690
until he is
completely fucking dead.

1:22:01.724 --> 1:22:03.726
He's a sick boy,
Layton.

1:22:03.759 --> 1:22:06.129
He does things
to hurt people.

1:22:08.663 --> 1:22:12.035
Like I did things
to hurt people

1:22:12.068 --> 1:22:15.738
that I cared about more
than anything in the world.

1:22:15.770 --> 1:22:17.773
And I am
so sorry for that.

1:22:22.778 --> 1:22:25.382
You weren't that bad.

1:22:29.151 --> 1:22:33.589
Actually, fuck it,
you were a terrible father.

1:22:33.621 --> 1:22:37.059
Half the time,
the other half, you were...

1:22:37.093 --> 1:22:38.627
You were okay.

1:22:38.661 --> 1:22:42.165
Thanks.
It's more than I deserve.

1:22:42.197 --> 1:22:45.501
Yeah. I know...
and you're welcome.

1:22:52.507 --> 1:22:55.511
I've made so many
mistakes in my life.

1:22:57.313 --> 1:23:00.783
I've been in the wrong
place so many times,

1:23:00.815 --> 1:23:02.352
I feel that...

1:23:04.854 --> 1:23:08.391
...it's just been one
long series of mistakes.

1:23:10.693 --> 1:23:14.564
And that it might have been
better for everybody if I...

1:23:17.299 --> 1:23:19.734
Anyway.

1:23:19.768 --> 1:23:24.707
What can you say, except...

1:23:24.739 --> 1:23:26.843
"I'm sorry"?

1:23:29.345 --> 1:23:33.549
And I'm just thankful
to be with you guys today

1:23:33.581 --> 1:23:36.718
in the right place.

1:23:36.751 --> 1:23:38.187
Thank you.

1:23:40.156 --> 1:23:42.558
Thanks, Samuel.

Hey, look who it is.
Good old Lazarus.

1:27:16.537 --> 1:27:18.640
How goes
the sober resurrection?

1:27:18.674 --> 1:27:22.812
Taking it one day at a time,
as they say.

1:27:22.845 --> 1:27:25.414
God, what a beautiful day.

1:27:25.447 --> 1:27:28.618
Spring. Let's take a walk,
old friend.

1:27:30.919 --> 1:27:32.988
Sorry about that Lazarus gag.
I wasn't thinking.

1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:35.991
Don't worry about it.

1:27:36.023 --> 1:27:39.627
I still don't understand why
you didn't tell anyone earlier.

1:27:39.661 --> 1:27:41.997
Maybe you could
have done something,

1:27:42.029 --> 1:27:44.599
help somehow.

1:27:44.632 --> 1:27:47.135
I don't understand it myself.

1:27:47.169 --> 1:27:48.604
Yeah.

1:27:48.636 --> 1:27:51.506
Moving on to even
half of your topics.

1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:53.743
- The advanced copy.
- Oh.

1:27:53.776 --> 1:27:55.611
Almost done.

1:27:55.644 --> 1:27:58.581
- I actually like it.
- Thanks, I think.

1:27:58.613 --> 1:28:02.084
The part with the dead dad
is very touching stuff.

1:28:02.117 --> 1:28:03.652
Yeah.

1:28:03.684 --> 1:28:06.621
Frankenstein,
that was quite the surprise.

1:28:06.654 --> 1:28:08.623
Just, please, whatever you do,
don't tell me how it finishes up

1:28:08.657 --> 1:28:10.426
because I'm on
the edge of my seat.

1:28:10.459 --> 1:28:11.926
Lips are sealed.

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:14.830
Seriously, though, man,
it's a really great job.

1:28:14.862 --> 1:28:16.631
You should be very proud.

1:28:16.665 --> 1:28:19.568
Coming from you old friend,
that really means something.

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:21.770
Thank you.

1:28:21.804 --> 1:28:24.573
You're welcome,
you lucky bastard.

1:28:24.605 --> 1:28:26.408
Writing a book that's
better than anything

1:28:26.442 --> 1:28:29.712
I'll ever pull off,
return from the wild,

1:28:29.745 --> 1:28:32.948
clean and sober,
back in the saddle.

1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:34.983
In this little game
called life, my friend,

1:28:35.017 --> 1:28:36.684
you're the fucking big winner!

1:28:36.718 --> 1:28:41.456
Yes, I know it seems like that,
but I'm still dying.

1:28:41.489 --> 1:28:43.959
Could be gone any time,

1:28:43.992 --> 1:28:46.629
but fuck that death guy, right?

1:28:46.662 --> 1:28:48.731
Yeah, fuck that death guy.

1:28:48.764 --> 1:28:52.101
You know,
it's all true, Brendan.

1:28:53.801 --> 1:28:55.670
The sun is hot,

1:28:55.703 --> 1:28:57.773
the mountain is high,

1:28:57.805 --> 1:29:02.444
life is short, very short,

1:29:02.478 --> 1:29:04.881
but so, so beautiful.

1:29:06.982 --> 1:29:10.118
And, you know, we haven't
really talked since then.

1:29:10.152 --> 1:29:11.520
I kind of miss him.

1:29:11.553 --> 1:29:13.756
Have you told him how you feel?

1:29:13.788 --> 1:29:15.825
No, does that work?

1:29:15.858 --> 1:29:18.461
Yeah, yeah. I've heard that it...

1:29:18.493 --> 1:29:21.095
Oh, I've got you.

1:29:21.129 --> 1:29:23.733
- Okay?
- Yeah, this is fun.

1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:27.001
We got to do this more often.

1:29:27.035 --> 1:29:28.470
Yeah, we should.

1:29:33.608 --> 1:29:36.711
the November sun fell
on the cold green hill,

1:29:36.745 --> 1:29:40.082
and the sea rolled on
in blue black swells,

1:29:40.114 --> 1:29:42.617
and the smell of the cigarette
being smoked by the ghost of

1:29:42.651 --> 1:29:45.854
my father crackled in the wind.

1:29:45.888 --> 1:29:49.091
And a wind was blowing
through me as well,

1:29:49.123 --> 1:29:51.227
blowing cold through my days,

1:29:51.260 --> 1:29:54.497
cold through the years.

1:29:54.529 --> 1:29:59.100
And I wondered, "Who am I?"
as these avalanches overtake me.

1:29:59.134 --> 1:30:02.104
The five year old child
abandoned by his mother,

1:30:02.136 --> 1:30:04.873
shaking like a falling leaf?

1:30:04.907 --> 1:30:08.544
The sixteen year old boy
standing over his dying father,

1:30:08.577 --> 1:30:11.847
frozen like
winter morning water?

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:14.283
Or this man, grown old,

1:30:14.315 --> 1:30:19.721
sitting by sea's edge,
all alone with his dead dad?

1:30:19.755 --> 1:30:23.559
And I wondered, "Who am I

1:30:23.591 --> 1:30:25.594
and who are the ghosts?"

1:30:42.243 --> 1:30:43.813
Thank you.

1:30:45.346 --> 1:30:48.050
Samuel, I just wanted to say

1:30:48.082 --> 1:30:49.718
that was so good.

1:30:49.751 --> 1:30:50.519
Thank you.

1:30:50.551 --> 1:30:54.523
And also that,
um, I don't know.

1:30:55.991 --> 1:30:58.894
I'm... I'm glad that
you weren't a ghost.

1:30:58.926 --> 1:31:00.095
Me, too.

1:31:01.330 --> 1:31:03.533
That you've been
here for everyone.

1:31:05.233 --> 1:31:08.103
Yeah. Alright, off to
read my new favourite book.

1:31:08.135 --> 1:31:11.606
Yeah, careful.
Don't let it put you to sleep.

1:31:11.639 --> 1:31:13.642
I don't think so.

1:31:18.647 --> 1:31:20.282
Pretty good read there,
Professor,

1:31:20.314 --> 1:31:23.085
though it did seem
a little fucking familiar.

1:31:23.117 --> 1:31:24.319
What's going on, Chad?

1:31:24.353 --> 1:31:26.087
- My idea.
- What?

1:31:26.121 --> 1:31:28.757
My idea about the guy
who sees his dead father

1:31:28.790 --> 1:31:30.725
that I told you about
that morning on the mountain.

1:31:30.759 --> 1:31:32.861
How you stole my fucking idea!

1:31:32.894 --> 1:31:34.330
What are you talking...

1:31:34.362 --> 1:31:35.997
You stole my fucking idea
for your fucking book!

1:31:36.031 --> 1:31:37.332
Oh, sure, you dressed it up
with a few little bells

1:31:37.366 --> 1:31:38.901
and whistles,
but it's still my idea,

1:31:38.934 --> 1:31:40.970
that I fucking told you.
It's still my fucking story!

1:31:41.002 --> 1:31:43.738
You're a fucking thief.
You're a fucking thief.

1:31:43.772 --> 1:31:47.209
You stole my fucking idea.
You stole my fucking girlfriend.

1:31:47.242 --> 1:31:50.279
You stole everything.
I fucking hate you!

1:31:50.312 --> 1:31:52.314
I fucking hate you!

1:32:03.858 --> 1:32:05.361
Are you alright?

1:32:13.367 --> 1:32:15.136
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1:32:22.678 --> 1:32:23.879
Hey.

1:32:25.279 --> 1:32:27.015
Nice to see you.

1:32:27.049 --> 1:32:29.885
I was wondering where
you disappeared to.

1:32:29.917 --> 1:32:32.353
I'm sorry, son,
but it's time.

1:32:32.386 --> 1:32:33.723
What?

1:33:05.187 --> 1:33:08.823
Jesus Christ. The shifty
little fucker shot me.

1:33:08.857 --> 1:33:10.926
Yeah, yeah,
really blew your brains out.

1:33:10.959 --> 1:33:12.394
Couldn't you have
done something?

1:33:12.426 --> 1:33:14.263
Couldn't you
have warned me?

1:33:14.295 --> 1:33:16.297
Afraid not.

1:33:16.331 --> 1:33:18.200
It's time to go.

1:33:18.233 --> 1:33:20.102
But I can't leave now, Dad.
Look how they need me.

1:33:20.135 --> 1:33:24.105
I was just beginning
to make it up to them.

1:33:24.139 --> 1:33:26.142
They'll all be okay,
believe me.

1:33:27.776 --> 1:33:32.413
Somehow, some way,
they'll all be alright.

1:33:32.447 --> 1:33:36.385
- Are you sure, Dad?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1:33:38.519 --> 1:33:41.223
You were a good man, son.

1:33:41.255 --> 1:33:43.959
Proud of you.

1:33:43.992 --> 1:33:46.095
And I love you.

1:33:46.127 --> 1:33:48.930
- Ah, thanks, Dad.
- It's time to go.

1:33:50.998 --> 1:33:52.300
So...

1:33:55.136 --> 1:33:57.305
So, this is dying?

1:33:59.407 --> 1:34:02.177
Yeah, this is dying.

1:34:02.210 --> 1:34:03.479
Not what I expected.

1:34:05.447 --> 1:34:08.817
This isn't exactly the end.

1:34:08.849 --> 1:34:12.353
This is more like we're
walking up to the station,

1:34:12.386 --> 1:34:14.989
about to catch our train.

1:34:15.023 --> 1:34:17.459
And where are we headed?

1:34:17.492 --> 1:34:18.894
Home.

1:34:18.926 --> 1:34:21.796
Home?
Will Mum be there?

1:34:23.497 --> 1:34:25.399
Sorry, son, it doesn't
really work like that.

1:34:25.433 --> 1:34:27.069
Well, how does it work?

1:34:27.102 --> 1:34:32.073
