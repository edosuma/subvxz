00:02.328 --> 00:04.296
<i>Our ship crash-landed on Earth.</i>

00:04.298 --> 00:06.498
<i>We came here seeking refuge,
but the humans thought</i>

00:06.500 --> 00:08.233
<i>that it was an invasion.</i>

00:08.235 --> 00:09.801
(all yelling)

00:10.816 --> 00:14.184
<i>That night I met a human
girl who tried to protect me.</i>

00:14.186 --> 00:16.119
<i>A girl I never thought I'd see again.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:17.621
<i>The surviving members of my race,</i>

00:17.623 --> 00:19.489
<i>the Atrians, were rounded up</i>

00:19.491 --> 00:21.658
<i>and isolated inside a militarized sector.</i>

00:22.160 --> 00:23.493
<i>Now, it's 2024.</i>

00:23.495 --> 00:26.763
<i>Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school</i>

00:26.765 --> 00:28.264
<i>as a part of a government
integration program.</i>

00:28.266 --> 00:29.699
<i>But the humans and the Atrians</i>

00:29.701 --> 00:31.701
<i>continue to distrust each other</i>

00:31.703 --> 00:34.304
<i>while I fight to protect my people</i>

00:34.306 --> 00:36.239
<i>and the human girl who saved my life</i>

00:36.241 --> 00:37.841
<i>at any cost.</i>

00:37.896 --> 00:40.196
<i>Previously on Star-Crossed:</i>

00:40.198 --> 00:43.233
I am the Grand Matriarch of the Red Hawks.

00:43.235 --> 00:45.902
We're amassing more explosives

00:45.904 --> 00:47.904
- to destroy the Atrians.
- (men cheer)

00:47.906 --> 00:49.672
What's going on?

00:49.674 --> 00:52.075
She's being charged with
planning a terrorist attack!

00:52.077 --> 00:54.544
The cube is gonna take
root inside Beaumont's body,

00:54.546 --> 00:57.247
spreading its spores throughout Edendale.

00:57.249 --> 01:00.183
You broke the Trag code,
so now you have to die.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.751
(gasps)

01:03.554 --> 01:05.455
- We should kill her.
- You can't do this.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.757
Whether we like it or not, she's one of us.

01:07.759 --> 01:10.426
You just signed your own death sentences.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.469
<i>ROMAN: Do you think it
doesn't kill me every time</i>

01:19.471 --> 01:21.604
<i>I have to walk away from you?</i>

01:21.606 --> 01:23.973
<i>I would give you everything...</i>

01:28.011 --> 01:30.947
<i>(echoing): Just not now.</i>

01:30.949 --> 01:32.381
MICHELLE: Emery, breakfast is ready!

01:32.383 --> 01:34.050
<i>REPORTER (on TV): For the first time,</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:35.985
we've gotten a look at the inner workings

01:35.987 --> 01:37.520
of the Red Hawk organization.

01:37.522 --> 01:41.257
Margaret Montrose was
caught on video last night

01:41.259 --> 01:43.159
leading a secret Red Hawk meeting

01:43.161 --> 01:45.461
and planning an attack
at the Atrian Sector.

01:45.463 --> 01:46.929
The local philanthropist is being held...

01:46.931 --> 01:48.864
- without bail pending trial.
- Are you okay?

01:48.866 --> 01:51.033
Never thought this is what

01:51.035 --> 01:53.269
my 15 minutes of fame would look like.

01:53.271 --> 01:54.804
(turns off TV)

01:54.806 --> 01:57.673
Try and ignore them. Reporters
were all over our house

01:57.675 --> 01:59.175
after the shooting at the Sector.

01:59.177 --> 02:01.710
There's French toast on the stove,
you guys. We should get going

02:01.712 --> 02:04.246
if we're gonna get to my folks' by noon.

02:04.248 --> 02:05.915
Grayson, you can stay
here as long as you need.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.851
Thanks, but my uncle offered to put me up.

02:08.853 --> 02:12.388
Let us know if there's anything you need.

02:16.459 --> 02:18.894
Your parents are being
really cool about this.

02:18.896 --> 02:21.663
You're lucky to have them.

02:21.665 --> 02:23.999
After everything that my dad went through,

02:24.001 --> 02:25.334
they understand what it's like

02:25.336 --> 02:27.136
to have your world turned upside down.

02:27.138 --> 02:30.339
(quietly): Yeah.

02:31.174 --> 02:33.742
I'm so sorry.

02:33.744 --> 02:35.511
Don't be.

02:35.513 --> 02:38.080
If it wasn't for you, I'm
not sure I ever would have

02:38.082 --> 02:40.282
had the guts to stand up to
my parents in the first place.

02:42.252 --> 02:46.154
For years, I would overlook
things that they said or did

02:46.156 --> 02:47.656
because they were my parents.

02:47.658 --> 02:49.358
But that whole time, they were lying to me.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.525
How do you do that?

02:50.527 --> 02:52.227
How do you look somebody in the eyes

02:52.229 --> 02:55.063
that you care about and lie to them?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.235
Sometimes I think it's
just harder for people

03:00.237 --> 03:01.803
to admit the truth.

03:06.943 --> 03:08.877
I have so many questions.

03:08.879 --> 03:10.879
I'm gonna go see my mom today.

03:10.881 --> 03:13.448
I figure it's better to get it all out

03:13.450 --> 03:14.883
than bottle it up, right?

03:14.885 --> 03:17.886
I think you're probably right.

03:17.888 --> 03:19.487
You mind coming along?

03:19.489 --> 03:21.990
I could use the support.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.260
Of course.

03:27.897 --> 03:29.731
You need to quit the Trags.

03:29.733 --> 03:32.400
Once you're in, there's no
going back. You know that.

03:32.402 --> 03:35.403
All I can do now is let 'em
think I'm still with them.

03:35.405 --> 03:37.038
Maybe you really don't want out.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.874
Hey, I stopped Zoe from
killing you last night.

03:39.876 --> 03:41.676
You really need more assurance than that?

03:42.745 --> 03:45.079
We need to find Zoe before she tells Vega

03:45.081 --> 03:46.915
that we wrecked her
plans to kidnap Grayson.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.349
If Vega finds out, we're both dead.

03:48.351 --> 03:50.718
Yeah, but you were their go-between.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.921
Zoe can't get into the Sector to tell Vega.

03:52.923 --> 03:54.756
That's where her looking
human actually helps us.

03:54.758 --> 03:56.924
Yeah, but Zoe's smart and relentless.

03:56.926 --> 03:59.894
She'll find a way to get to Vega.

03:59.896 --> 04:02.663
Or she might just come
gunning for us herself.

04:24.886 --> 04:26.354
JULIA: Wow. Bad timing.

04:26.356 --> 04:28.589
No kidding. How was I
supposed to tell Grayson

04:28.591 --> 04:31.392
about Roman when he showed
up on my doorstep last night?

04:31.394 --> 04:33.127
He deserves to know, Em.

04:33.129 --> 04:34.628
Sure, I'll just mention
it to him while we're

04:34.630 --> 04:37.365
on our way to visit
his mom in prison later.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.967
Who, by the way, is there because of me.

04:39.969 --> 04:41.802
No, she's there because she's a terrorist.

04:41.804 --> 04:43.504
You have to let yourself off the hook.

04:43.506 --> 04:45.606
There's no way you would
have known that Grayson's mom

04:45.608 --> 04:47.475
- would be at that meeting.
- Maybe not.

04:47.477 --> 04:49.677
It's, just, I was the one that told Grayson

04:49.679 --> 04:51.145
to stand up to his parents.

04:51.147 --> 04:53.347
You can't stay with Grayson out of guilt.

04:53.349 --> 04:56.150
It's not just that.

04:56.152 --> 04:58.118
Grayson's been there for me.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.655
After the mess I've made,
I need to be there for him.

05:01.657 --> 05:03.757
(speaking low, indistinctly)

05:03.759 --> 05:05.559
I can't think about Roman right now.

05:05.561 --> 05:09.096
I just need to see this
thing through with Grayson.

05:09.098 --> 05:10.898
For how long?

05:10.900 --> 05:13.801
As long as it takes.

05:19.107 --> 05:22.342
I told you to go over there
last night. What happened?

05:22.344 --> 05:25.779
Oh, I made it to the front
door, but Grayson was there.

05:25.781 --> 05:27.581
Saw them through the window.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.183
They looked cozy.

05:29.185 --> 05:32.252
Maybe we should've let Zoe
take Grayson out after all.

05:36.224 --> 05:38.492
ERIC: I can't believe that about your mom.

05:38.494 --> 05:40.460
How is she? Ha... Have you seen her yet?

05:40.462 --> 05:43.463
No, but I will.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.298
Actually, can we talk about something else?

05:45.300 --> 05:47.734
Uh, yeah, the...

05:47.736 --> 05:49.035
I'm failing trig.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.370
Wow.

05:53.174 --> 05:55.275
Um, I could tutor you, if you want.

05:55.277 --> 05:58.044
What? It's not that big a deal.
Trig's hard. For some reason,

05:58.046 --> 05:59.546
I picked it up quickly.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.214
But trust me, there are
plenty of things I don't get.

06:01.216 --> 06:02.682
Like cars.

06:02.684 --> 06:04.150
You leave Bruce out of this.

06:04.152 --> 06:06.019
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Who's Bruce?

06:06.021 --> 06:08.088
- Her beat-up old car.
- I like to thing of Bruce

06:08.090 --> 06:09.456
as a member of the family.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.292
Because he's been passed down
from generation to generation

06:12.294 --> 06:13.493
for centuries.

06:13.495 --> 06:14.894
Ha-ha, you joke,

06:14.896 --> 06:16.963
but I've actually been a
little worried about Bruce.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.565
Every time I speed up,

06:18.567 --> 06:20.633
he's starts making this
weird chirping sound.

06:20.635 --> 06:21.701
That's your fan belt.

06:21.703 --> 06:23.002
Or a reason to get a new car.

06:23.004 --> 06:25.705
I think you should stick
with Bruce, chirping and all.

06:25.707 --> 06:27.474
Loyalty's important.

06:27.476 --> 06:28.675
Thank you, Grayson.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.111
BENTON: Hey, guys. Enjoying your Sunday?

06:32.113 --> 06:33.780
Hi, Miss Benton.

06:33.782 --> 06:36.749
Hey, Grayson, so sorry about your mom.

06:37.852 --> 06:40.053
If you want to talk,
my door is always open.

06:40.055 --> 06:43.022
Thanks. Yeah, uh, I appreciate it.

06:43.024 --> 06:46.125
All right. See you guys in class.

06:57.304 --> 07:00.573
Hey, waiting on somebody?

07:00.575 --> 07:03.943
Taylor. Guess she lost track of time.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.878
Uh, listen, I know you like Taylor.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.413
And I admire your taste.

07:07.415 --> 07:09.582
It's like the girl carries
around her own wind machine.

07:09.584 --> 07:11.517
(chuckles) It's just...

07:11.519 --> 07:13.920
you do realize that she likes guys, right?

07:13.922 --> 07:16.656
So? I do, too.

07:16.658 --> 07:20.693
Atrians don't choose who
we love based on gender.

07:20.695 --> 07:23.963
Isn't that... limiting?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.498
Not so much for me.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.867
But hey, to each his own.

07:27.869 --> 07:29.869
Or her own.

07:35.709 --> 07:37.810
Oh, call Zoe.

07:37.812 --> 07:40.379
(phone ringing)

07:47.120 --> 07:50.289
Okay, this is the third
message I'm leaving you.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.091
We need to debrief about the party.

07:52.093 --> 07:54.493
You disappeared and... I must have details

07:54.495 --> 07:56.695
so call me back. Okay?

07:59.065 --> 08:01.467
Hey, hold on. Let me help out.

08:01.469 --> 08:02.768
Hey, let me help.

08:02.770 --> 08:04.269
Let me help. What do you need help with?

08:04.271 --> 08:06.872
Thanks. Uh, can you pop the trunk for me?

08:06.874 --> 08:09.074
Thanks.

08:16.816 --> 08:18.684
(coughing)

08:24.157 --> 08:27.859
- (laughing)
- Lukas! Lukas!

08:27.861 --> 08:30.228
Lukas! (shouting indistinctly)

08:30.230 --> 08:33.097
Not exactly what I had
in mind, but he'll do.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.068
(starts engine)

08:38.571 --> 08:41.273
TAYLOR: I need an ambulance!
My friend started choking

08:41.275 --> 08:42.874
and then collapsed on the ground!

08:42.876 --> 08:44.943
Help, you guys! Help me!

08:44.945 --> 08:47.712
Let's lay him out.

08:47.714 --> 08:50.949
Here. Put him down.

08:50.951 --> 08:52.551
Someone help!

08:52.553 --> 08:53.885
Breathe. You're okay.

08:53.887 --> 08:55.220
You're okay. Just try to breathe.

08:55.222 --> 08:57.289
Just try to breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.391
Breathe, buddy. An ambulance is coming.

08:59.393 --> 09:01.960
GRAYSON: It's okay.

09:13.067 --> 09:15.034
Drake.

09:16.036 --> 09:18.271
This is black cyper, isn't it?

09:18.273 --> 09:19.506
Where'd you get it?

09:19.508 --> 09:22.375
Emery found it in Taylor's car.

09:22.377 --> 09:24.944
Zoe must have put it there.

09:24.946 --> 09:26.379
We got to get back and talk to Castor.

09:26.381 --> 09:29.782
- He'll know what to do.
- Hey, Roman.

09:30.651 --> 09:32.952
So that was some kind of cyper?

09:34.021 --> 09:35.822
Did it do that to Lukas? Who put it there?

09:35.824 --> 09:38.157
Roman, if you know something,
you need to tell me.

09:38.159 --> 09:40.360
That's my best friend who just
got taken away in an ambulance.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.894
He's my friend, too.

09:41.896 --> 09:43.796
But if we have any chance
of helping Lukas, we got

09:43.798 --> 09:46.232
to get back to the Sector and
learn more about what this is.

09:46.234 --> 09:50.036
I know this isn't easy, but...
you got to trust me on this.

09:50.038 --> 09:52.805
I'll be at the hospital.

09:56.610 --> 09:58.644
Lukas is gonna be all right.

09:58.646 --> 10:00.646
The doctors will know what to do with him.

10:02.115 --> 10:05.250
<i>ROMAN: So you're thinking Lukas
was not the intended target?</i>

10:05.252 --> 10:07.086
Zoe must have been
testing the black cyper

10:07.088 --> 10:09.355
to make sure it worked.
And she hates Taylor.

10:09.357 --> 10:11.090
What did Vega say was the
next step in the Trags' plan?

10:11.092 --> 10:12.324
She didn't tell me.

10:12.326 --> 10:13.893
But Zoe took me to a field

10:13.895 --> 10:15.427
where I helped her plant
some in Beaumont's body.

10:15.429 --> 10:17.363
Well, if the black cyper's been planted,

10:17.365 --> 10:19.131
that means there's a
lot more of it out there.

10:19.133 --> 10:20.299
Yeah. I can take you to the site

10:20.301 --> 10:21.634
where we buried the body.

10:21.636 --> 10:23.969
Gotta know how to get rid of it first.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.605
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr.
Morris, dial 112, please.

10:27.974 --> 10:30.543
Dr. Morris, please dial 112.

10:32.712 --> 10:34.179
EMERY: Mrs. Parnell.

10:35.348 --> 10:36.682
Emery.

10:36.684 --> 10:38.751
How're you holding up, dear?

10:38.753 --> 10:40.085
I'm fine. How're you?

10:40.087 --> 10:41.787
My boy's strong.

10:41.789 --> 10:43.522
A bunch of our friends
are here to support Lukas,

10:43.524 --> 10:44.857
but they didn't want to crowd you.

10:44.859 --> 10:46.625
This is...

10:46.627 --> 10:47.559
Sophia?

10:47.561 --> 10:49.661
Lukas talks about you

10:49.663 --> 10:51.397
all the time.

10:51.399 --> 10:54.133
I'm so glad you're here.

10:56.402 --> 10:57.703
Ma'am.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.204
Yes, Doctor?

10:59.206 --> 11:00.806
Lukas's lungs are badly burned

11:00.808 --> 11:02.307
from the toxic substance he inhaled,

11:02.309 --> 11:03.642
and his airways are swollen.

11:03.644 --> 11:04.943
He isn't responding to treatment.

11:04.945 --> 11:06.745
We are running a few more tests,

11:06.747 --> 11:08.280
but if we can't get the swelling down soon,

11:08.282 --> 11:09.748
he won't be able to
breathe air into his lungs.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.883
I'm very sorry.

11:11.885 --> 11:13.385
We're doing everything we can.

11:13.387 --> 11:16.655
Thank you, Doctor.

11:22.111 --> 11:24.246
CASTOR: Vega's always been reckless,

11:24.248 --> 11:27.482
but this is extreme, even for her.

11:27.484 --> 11:28.717
And you planted this.

11:28.719 --> 11:30.953
Drake can be trusted.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.121
How can this leaf wipe out an entire race?

11:33.123 --> 11:34.556
CASTOR: It's not the leaf, Roman.

11:34.558 --> 11:36.491
It's the spores.

11:36.493 --> 11:38.593
Let me show you.

11:39.963 --> 11:42.130
When a black cyper bush grows,

11:42.132 --> 11:43.498
eventually it releases

11:43.500 --> 11:45.434
all of its spores into the air.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.369
If inhaled directly,

11:47.371 --> 11:49.971
the spores from a single black cyper leaf

11:49.973 --> 11:51.873
can seriously, if not fatally,

11:51.875 --> 11:53.275
burn the lungs of a human.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.377
So just imagine entire bushes

11:55.379 --> 11:58.046
releasing the spores at the same time.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.532
ROMAN: So how do we help Lukas?

12:01.534 --> 12:04.968
CASTOR: The only cure is
freshly-cut black cyper

12:04.971 --> 12:06.938
mixed with Atrian blood.

12:06.940 --> 12:08.640
And if we can find the
black cyper plant,

12:08.642 --> 12:11.109
how do we get rid of the rest of it?

12:20.452 --> 12:23.855
You detonate this in
the center of the plant.

12:25.057 --> 12:26.691
A bomb?

12:26.693 --> 12:27.992
Why do you even have this?

12:27.994 --> 12:29.861
For reasons such as this.

12:29.863 --> 12:32.130
Don't worry, it is not detectable

12:32.132 --> 12:33.865
by the SEU scanners.

12:33.867 --> 12:35.967
Now the question is: when
did you plant the body?

12:35.969 --> 12:37.168
Eight days ago.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.469
Eight days is the life cycle

12:38.471 --> 12:39.670
of the plant, which means

12:39.672 --> 12:42.039
it will release its spores today.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.575
- Now, did you plant any other bodies?
- No.

12:44.577 --> 12:46.644
If you can find and destroy the plant

12:46.646 --> 12:48.613
before it releases its spores,

12:48.615 --> 12:50.514
Vega's plan will be averted.

12:50.516 --> 12:52.116
So go.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.752
And I'll keep my ear to
the ground in the Sector.

12:59.858 --> 13:01.292
Colleen?

13:01.294 --> 13:03.227
Emery.

13:03.229 --> 13:05.129
My goodness. How you been?

13:05.131 --> 13:06.731
It's been so long... you look great.

13:06.733 --> 13:08.432
I'm good, I'm just here visiting a friend.

13:08.434 --> 13:09.500
Lukas Parnell?

13:09.502 --> 13:12.069
Oh, I heard. I'm so sorry.

13:12.071 --> 13:14.705
Have you seen anyone
with his symptoms before?

13:14.707 --> 13:16.674
The doctors aren't saying much.

13:16.676 --> 13:18.509
Emery.

13:18.511 --> 13:19.944
Please, Colleen,

13:19.946 --> 13:21.946
he's one of my best friends.

13:25.584 --> 13:28.085
Look, you didn't hear this from me, but...

13:28.087 --> 13:29.353
they found a camper yesterday

13:29.355 --> 13:31.088
out in Black Bear Lake State Park.

13:31.090 --> 13:32.623
Brought him in with the same symptoms.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.658
Some kind of chemical burn in his lungs.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.026
How's he doing?

13:40.231 --> 13:42.666
(birds chirping)

13:42.668 --> 13:44.435
- You're sure this is the place?
- Positive.

13:44.437 --> 13:46.503
Zoe must have moved the body.

14:00.051 --> 14:02.286
(screech)

14:06.725 --> 14:10.393
If Castor's right, we only have hours
before black cyper covers the entire town.

14:10.395 --> 14:12.562
Are you sure you can get Taylor to help us?

14:12.564 --> 14:14.464
Yeah, we have a, uh, connection.

14:14.466 --> 14:17.500
Besides, she's our only
lead if we want to find Zoe.

14:18.769 --> 14:19.769
How's Lukas?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.438
He's the same: not good.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.440
I was hoping there was something

14:24.442 --> 14:26.576
you could do to help him.

14:28.378 --> 14:31.681
(sighs) Emery, cyper can't cure him.

14:31.683 --> 14:33.749
- She knows about cyper?
- She can be trusted.

14:33.751 --> 14:36.552
Yeah? What about her Red Hawk boyfriend?

14:36.554 --> 14:40.055
Grayson and I saved you from the Red
Hawks during the Carnival, remember that?

14:40.057 --> 14:43.093
Your secret's safe with me,
I just want Lukas to get better.

14:43.094 --> 14:46.394
Emery, Lukas can only be cured using
black cyper that's been cut the same day.

14:46.395 --> 14:48.230
 The leaf you found won't work.

14:48.232 --> 14:50.100
- Can you get more?
- We're working on it.

14:50.102 --> 14:52.169
We think it's being grown
somewhere remote.

14:52.171 --> 14:54.737
There was a camper yesterday who's
brought in with the same symptoms.

14:54.739 --> 14:57.807
He was found at Black Bear Lake State Park.
It doesn't get more remote than that.

14:57.832 --> 14:59.108
- Where is it?
- I can take you there.

14:59.109 --> 15:02.142
I actually know it pretty well. My dad
used to take me hiking there all the time.

15:02.144 --> 15:03.978
No, you don't need to come.
This could be too dangerous.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.581
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help Lukas.

15:05.583 --> 15:08.916
So you can either come with me, or I'm
gonna go search the park on my own.

15:08.953 --> 15:10.519
(short laugh)

15:10.521 --> 15:12.254
All right. I'll go with Emery.

15:12.256 --> 15:13.455
You find Zoe.

15:13.457 --> 15:15.424
Maybe one of us will have some luck.

15:18.545 --> 15:20.379
Hey, you okay?

15:20.381 --> 15:22.147
(sighs) Barely.

15:22.149 --> 15:24.783
My throat's totally scratchy

15:24.785 --> 15:26.752
and I have to stick around for more tests.

15:26.754 --> 15:28.821
The paramedics say
I should be fine,

15:28.823 --> 15:30.689
but how can they be so sure?
It's not like they're doctors.

15:30.691 --> 15:32.991
I mean, I was standing right
there when Lukas inhaled...

15:32.993 --> 15:35.927
(quick deep breath) ...whatever that was.

15:41.968 --> 15:44.136
It's not like you and Zoe even care.

15:46.372 --> 15:48.940
I saw you two leave Grayson's
party together last night.

15:48.942 --> 15:50.308
It's not what you think.

15:51.444 --> 15:53.478
Despite the fact that I got it on with you

15:53.480 --> 15:55.413
in a public bathroom, I'm not an idiot.

15:55.415 --> 15:57.249
Zoe told me there was a place

15:57.251 --> 15:59.651
where I could get booze
to take back to the Sector.

15:59.653 --> 16:01.019
That's all.

16:01.021 --> 16:02.587
Nothing happened.

16:05.391 --> 16:08.026
Zoe's been ignoring my calls all day.

16:09.762 --> 16:12.230
I thought maybe you two hooked up

16:12.232 --> 16:14.699
and she was avoiding me.

16:16.402 --> 16:18.603
Now I'm actually worried.

16:18.605 --> 16:21.339
She usually calls me back right away.

16:24.076 --> 16:26.277
I hope she's okay.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.413
Well, uh... what's her address?

16:28.415 --> 16:29.914
I mean, if it makes you feel any better,

16:29.916 --> 16:31.649
- I'll can go over there...
- Drake.

16:31.651 --> 16:34.552
Really? If you are using
me to get to Zoe, then...

16:34.554 --> 16:35.987
I swear that Zoe

16:35.989 --> 16:38.623
is the last person on the planet

16:38.625 --> 16:41.159
I want to get with.

16:42.161 --> 16:43.995
Besides, I, uh...

16:43.997 --> 16:46.230
I prefer blondes.

16:52.738 --> 16:55.006
(exhales)

16:55.008 --> 16:56.174
I'll check on Zoe.

16:58.110 --> 17:02.313
Why are we testing samples
from two high school girls?

17:02.315 --> 17:05.049
Because of something a
tabloid reporter said?

17:05.050 --> 17:06.349
A tabloid reporter

17:06.352 --> 17:08.219
who just blew the lid off the Red Hawks.

17:08.221 --> 17:11.489
And these aren't just
any two high school girls.

17:11.491 --> 17:13.124
Emery Whitehill and Julia Yeung

17:13.126 --> 17:15.492
were both hospitalized
with serious illnesses.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.962
Both of them recently made full recoveries.

17:17.964 --> 17:19.430
We've never been this close

17:19.432 --> 17:21.632
to cyper before.

17:21.634 --> 17:24.902
Once we've determined
if either girl was cured

17:24.904 --> 17:27.003
using cyper, we'll proceed.

17:27.006 --> 17:28.939
Not a moment before.

17:35.147 --> 17:36.981
EMERY: The nurse said the camper was found

17:36.983 --> 17:38.649
on the road, somewhere right around here.

17:38.651 --> 17:41.218
I know the best campsite,
it isn't on the map.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.520
Let's go.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.990
I heard you and Drake talking about Zoe.

17:45.992 --> 17:49.627
What does she have to do with all this?

17:49.629 --> 17:51.662
Okay, we're not going to doing this again.

17:51.664 --> 17:54.531
The whole "I can't tell you
for your own protection" crap.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.632
You're better off not knowing.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.001
That's for me to decide.

17:57.003 --> 17:58.369
Like it or not, I'm in this now.

17:58.371 --> 17:59.870
You really want to protect me,

17:59.872 --> 18:01.905
then let me know what we're up against.

18:03.975 --> 18:05.375
Zoe is an Atrian.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.744
She had her Atrian markings removed

18:07.746 --> 18:09.780
so she could pass as a human.

18:09.782 --> 18:11.448
And she's not the only one.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.617
There are other hidden Trags
living outside the Sector.

18:13.619 --> 18:16.787
You're saying there are hidden
Atrians living among the humans

18:16.789 --> 18:19.089
and one of them was inside of our school?

18:22.026 --> 18:23.293
Who are the Trags?

18:23.295 --> 18:25.696
(sighs)

18:25.698 --> 18:27.064
You've heard of the Atrian extremists

18:27.066 --> 18:28.865
who hate humans, right?

18:28.867 --> 18:31.168
They're the Trags. They're the
ones who have been targeting

18:31.170 --> 18:33.136
you and your family.

18:33.138 --> 18:35.172
One of those hidden Trags tried to kill you

18:35.174 --> 18:36.406
the night of the Carnival.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.009
But I was able to stop him.

18:39.011 --> 18:42.879
<i>So then what the Red
Hawks are saying is true?</i>

18:43.581 --> 18:46.516
There are hidden Atrians
trying to hurt humans.

18:46.818 --> 18:48.484
The Trags are a fringe group.

18:48.786 --> 18:50.953
Just like the Red Hawks.
And like the Red Hawks,

18:50.953 --> 18:51.820
they hate race-mixing.

18:51.824 --> 18:53.390
If they thought that you and I were
together, they would kill you.

18:53.492 --> 18:55.392
Just to send a message.

18:56.494 --> 18:57.894
(sighs)

18:57.896 --> 19:01.498
All I wanted was to protect you from this.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.867
All of it.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.503
No.

19:06.505 --> 19:08.671
I needed to hear this.

19:12.943 --> 19:16.679
I wanted to know all this time
why you kept pushing me away.

19:19.183 --> 19:21.050
Now I do.

19:26.023 --> 19:27.557
We should keep moving.

19:31.528 --> 19:34.931
(wrench ratcheting)

19:34.933 --> 19:36.799
What are you doing?

19:36.801 --> 19:39.335
Is this where you've been the whole time?

19:39.337 --> 19:41.471
Uh... Yeah, I...

19:41.473 --> 19:43.206
I hate hospitals.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.509
So I, I got you a new
fan belt, new spark plugs.

19:46.511 --> 19:48.478
What you really need is...

19:48.480 --> 19:50.546
new everything.

19:50.548 --> 19:53.382
Emery's right, you need a new car.

19:53.384 --> 19:55.585
Shh. Don't listen to him, Bruce.

19:55.587 --> 19:57.486
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.688
This car has character.

19:58.690 --> 20:00.022
If by character you mean

20:00.024 --> 20:01.724
rust... yeah, it has a ton.

20:01.726 --> 20:02.959
Cute.

20:02.961 --> 20:05.361
So, what do I owe you?

20:05.363 --> 20:07.163
I don't know.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.031
Um... if you want,

20:09.033 --> 20:10.733
you can just pay me back with tutoring.

20:10.735 --> 20:12.468
(wrench ratcheting)

20:12.470 --> 20:14.904
Okay, deal.

20:14.906 --> 20:17.239
I'll see you later then.

20:17.241 --> 20:18.407
Well, wait, wait.

20:18.409 --> 20:20.609
Um...

20:22.012 --> 20:23.979
This is from the grocery
store where I work.

20:23.981 --> 20:26.148
It's for Lukas's family.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.217
Hospital food sucks, you know?

20:28.219 --> 20:31.086
That's really sweet of you.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.893
Are you doing okay?

20:37.895 --> 20:40.863
Yeah.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.598
Yeah, I'm...

20:42.600 --> 20:44.033
I'm on my way to see my mom.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.601
And Emery was supposed to go with me,

20:45.603 --> 20:47.002
but she texted saying

20:47.004 --> 20:49.038
that she had to run out for a while.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.708
So I guess I'm going solo.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.376
I just wanted to check
on Lukas before I left.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.412
- Any change?
- No.

20:56.414 --> 21:00.015
I just wish there was something
I could do to help him.

21:00.017 --> 21:01.717
(beeping)

21:01.719 --> 21:04.219
Help! Hey!

21:04.221 --> 21:05.654
We need help in here!
