WEBVTT

01:30.450 --> 01:31.496
-Whoa.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.149
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:47.660 --> 01:48.945
-Whoa!

01:53.330 --> 01:55.867
-Okay. Okay.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.787
-Oh, Jesus! Come on!

02:14.080 --> 02:15.286
Oh, yeah.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.905
Jesus!

02:23.950 --> 02:27.033
-No, no, no, don't stop.
I can wait.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.571
Hey, honey, do me a favor,
get back on the horse.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.192
Listen, a guy is never
more truthful than just
after he's cum

02:33.250 --> 02:35.650
and I want complete honesty
from him now, so please.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.907
Suck a dick
for a white man, come on.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.696
-Is-- Is he--

02:40.750 --> 02:42.035
Are you serious?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.695
-What?

02:44.790 --> 02:46.496
-Are you serious?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.649
-About what?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.281
-About me staying here.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.615
-Do you want
to go to jail?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.940
I'm kidding.
Okay, come on.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.649
You're not going to jail.
You can leave.

03:06.910 --> 03:08.491
-Come on, now, let's go!
-Jesus.

03:11.660 --> 03:12.820
-Congratulations, anyway.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.695
-What are you doing here, Phil?

03:15.750 --> 03:19.072
-Vadik Koronev,
$640,000.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.320
Marina Jimenez, $560,000.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.616
-We've already been over this.
-Yeah, but now I got proof.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.901
Your Vietnamese pal,
Daewon Phan,

03:34.950 --> 03:36.497
we seized his laptop.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.440
-Uh, so...

03:45.500 --> 03:46.489
you want to take me in?

03:47.790 --> 03:50.190
Like you did with Ed Adler?

03:50.250 --> 03:53.071
Guy was sailing
the Mediterranean two days
after you cuffed him.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.782
Never_e_ven saw the inside
of a Jail cell, and neither
will I.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.650
-Neither will you,
that's right.

03:57.660 --> 03:59.901
You know why?
Because I've not come
to arrest you,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.537
I have come to be
yourfnend.

04:03.830 --> 04:04.819
Mmm-hmm.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.497
Because friends share.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.826
Andrew?

04:15.660 --> 04:17.571
Do you want
to be my friend?

04:21.370 --> 04:22.610
-How much?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.036
- Half.
- Half!

04:26.080 --> 04:29.948
-Your last deal came
to about 2.2 mil.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.150
I want half and I
will leave you alone.
-I can't get you half.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.940
-I will leave you alone.
-I can't get you half.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.367
-Shut up, click fuck!
You don't talk over me.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.536
You don't do that!

04:42.540 --> 04:44.576
I want half of what
you made on your
last move,

04:44.660 --> 04:48.369
or I make one phone call
and you might not
go to jail,

04:48.450 --> 04:50.361
but the entire score
will be seized.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.190
That's not good
news for you,

04:52.290 --> 04:54.440
considering who that
money belongs to.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.323
-I'll need a couple of days
to tee it up, make sure
there's no red flags.

05:02.410 --> 05:03.570
-Sure.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.281
-I'll meet you...

05:08.660 --> 05:11.151
to make the transfer...

05:12.580 --> 05:14.901
-together.
-Like friends do.

05:14.950 --> 05:16.497
-No.

05:20.660 --> 05:23.652
Is this really how
you want to do this?

05:23.700 --> 05:25.531
-Yes, it is, yeah.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.150
-Just like the other guys.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.366
I thought you were
better than that.

05:34.620 --> 05:35.826
-Me, too.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.649
Me, too.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.151
-Whoo! You good?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.570
-Are you going to be
home all day?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.247
-Uh, I don't know.

06:36.290 --> 06:37.575
-You don't know?

06:37.620 --> 06:39.611
-Yeah, I don't know.
I got stuff to do. Why?

06:39.660 --> 06:43.152
-You got stuff to do, okay.
I have a UPS coming, but I
have to go to this meeting.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.071
- You got more stuff
coming, really?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.572
-Look, you gotta put
that somewhere else.

06:47.660 --> 06:50.072
-Put it where, Chad,
I can't afford a place.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.822
- My electric was 600
bucks last month.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.155
No lay is worth that much.

06:59.330 --> 07:01.491
Izz, come on!

07:01.500 --> 07:02.489
It was a joke!

07:09.250 --> 07:10.239
Izzy!

07:11.290 --> 07:14.157
Izz, come on,
I was joking.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.862
What? Are you suddenly
going to pretend like you
have feelings for me now?

07:16.910 --> 07:18.821
-I liked you.
-Izz.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.656
You don't like anyone.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.077
You pretend to, just so
you can get things from them.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.328
You're a user. Look,
I feel like a click that I let
it go on this long, but I--

07:27.500 --> 07:29.821
Jesus Christ!
Are you serious right now?

07:29.870 --> 07:30.905
-Get out!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.490
-This is my house!
-Get out!

07:32.540 --> 07:35.498
-You're insane.
Get your shit,
get the fuck out!

07:35.500 --> 07:36.990
Go!

07:57.000 --> 08:01.152
-There's understandably lots
of confusion from clients
about which way to go,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.828
and unfortunately,
there's just no
clear answer,

08:03.870 --> 08:06.361
so I would ask _
your clients to be patient.

08:06.410 --> 08:07.820
We're gonna
get them through this.

08:44.410 --> 08:48.198
Dad, Dad, can you
please be careful with that?
It breaks really easily.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.490
Okay, sweetie.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.195
Babe, is that you?

08:53.250 --> 08:55.150
-Yeah! Hey.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.821
Hey!

08:56.830 --> 08:59.446
Hey, how was work?
-It was good. Thanks.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.786
-Hey, my dad's home.
-Hey. Right.

09:01.830 --> 09:04.116
-Hey, Nick.
-Hey, Leo.
How are you?

09:04.160 --> 09:06.993
-I'm good. I'm sorry, I'll get
out of your hair. I'm just
helping Tay move some stuff.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.149
-No, thank you.
Thank you so much.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.490
-So, are you loving it?

09:09.580 --> 09:11.445
-Yeah, I mean, who could
not love it? It's amazing.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.572
I... don't know how
we'll ever repay you.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.157
-Well, don't worry about it.
It's a good starter, you know.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.406
-Sure.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.860
-So, how's work?

09:21.910 --> 09:24.902
-Work-- Work's okay, yeah.

09:24.950 --> 09:27.532
I don't know.
I'm thinking about, maybe--

09:27.580 --> 09:29.741
I don't know, I've been
thinking about a few
other things lately.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.497
-Yeah, Nick is thinking
about starting his own
micro-financing firm.

09:32.540 --> 09:38.490
-Well, I've been wanting to do
something that makes
a difference to anyone, ever.

09:38.540 --> 09:41.532
-Baby, what do you think about
this mirror? We've been talking
about where we should put it.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.112
Hey, Nicky,
it's your father.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.278
I was wondering if you could,
maybe, come down to The Keys
tonight. There's something I...

10:11.330 --> 10:13.742
need to talk to you about.
I'd rather do it in person,
you know.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.440
-Delfi.
-What?

10:22.500 --> 10:23.819
-Come.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.320
Taste this.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.616
- It's okay.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.491
I'm joking, Mom.
It's awesome.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.741
-Delfi, you cannot sit
these people together.
-Why not?

10:34.790 --> 10:36.940
-They'll kill each other.
-Adolfo. Adolfo!

10:38.040 --> 10:39.155
It's stained.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.033
--What's that?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.940
-Izzy! Izzy!

10:49.000 --> 10:52.117
No, no, no, no, hey!
These are not living here.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.151
-I got nowhere else
to put 'em.
-Oh, really?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.656
Hey, I got an idea.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.151
How about a job, huh?
How about renting
an apartment?

10:58.160 --> 10:59.866
-How about this is my job?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.492
-What? You're going
to tell me that people
are paying you for this?

11:02.500 --> 11:03.785
-They will, soon.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.445
-What?
-Hey, SIS.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.786
-Hey, Delly Belly.
-Corazon, this might be
better in your room.

11:07.830 --> 11:11.118
-No, Dad, it's not enough
amps in there. I've been
telling you that since I was 12.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.446
-What happened to Pookie-Head?
-Pookie-Head kicked me out.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.240
That sucks, but can't
you get another place?

11:15.290 --> 11:17.656
-I'm out of cash.
-Oh, big surprise there!

11:17.750 --> 11:20.287
- Step off, Mom, I swear--
Marta! Izzy!

11:20.330 --> 11:21.820
- Please!_Por favor!
- Seriously?

11:21.870 --> 11:24.111
-I got the biggest pitch
of my damn life tomorrow.
-GenCoin?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.993
-Yeah, this private loans
dude's bringing me in.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.247
-Is this her blog thing?
-No, Dad, it's not.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.939
Do you even know
what a blog is?
-It's a currency.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.740
A digital currency that's
going to change the world.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.405
-Oh, it's going to
change the world?

11:34.450 --> 11:36.156
Hey, you've been saying
that for years!

11:36.160 --> 11:38.572
-It's not tied to any
governments, any banks,
any regulations.

11:38.660 --> 11:40.150
Anybody in the world
can use it.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.997
All you need
is a cell phone.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.782
I don't think you have
one of those, do you?
-I got a flip phone.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.115
-You can't use--

11:46.160 --> 11:48.492
Just let her stay for a while.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.531
It'll be nice to have
the two of them
together again.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.828
- You know what? I did not
sacrIfIce my entire savmgs—-
Sacnﬁce?

11:53.830 --> 11:56.651
-Yes, sacrifice, to send you
to Stanford--

11:56.660 --> 11:58.651
-I was not begging
you to go there!

11:58.750 --> 12:02.572
-Hey! For you to run around
and cr_eate-- What? What is this?
LIke, computer games?

12:02.620 --> 12:04.827
Whatever the hell this is!
-Hey! Guess what?

12:04.870 --> 12:08.362
-What?
-I let that molly-popping Key
Rat cum inside me for a year

12:08.410 --> 12:10.901
so I could build
the algorithm
for GenCoin.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.281
Don't lecture me
on sacrifice.

12:36.580 --> 12:37.740
-Huh, that was quick.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.286
-We_ shouldn't do
this anymore.
-You drunk yet?

12:42.330 --> 12:44.616
-How's work?
-I could use a shower.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.993
- Fuck! Fuck!

13:46.580 --> 13:47.865
-Let's start over.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.989
All right?

13:58.660 --> 13:59.820
-What's stopping us?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.900
All my stuff's
still in storage.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.444
It's like a day
of unpacking.

14:08.370 --> 14:09.496
-Yeah.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.577
-I can quit.
I can quit all of it.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.690
We can travel,
like we always
said we would.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.155
Huh?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.445
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.650
China, Thailand, anywhere.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.326
-Cheryl, do you wanna?

14:28.330 --> 14:29.365
-Yeah.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.866
-Do you wanna?
-Yeah.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.695
-We have to call off
the dogs first though, huh?

14:49.450 --> 14:50.860
-You had me there
for a second.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.787
-No, wait.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.115
I'm serious.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.650
-You're so full of shit!

15:00.160 --> 15:02.822
How long did you plan
on keeping that up for, huh?

15:02.870 --> 15:04.690
-What are you
talking about?

15:04.750 --> 15:06.650
-Ti|| all the lavwers went away?

15:06.700 --> 15:08.247
Till you got
your pension?

15:08.330 --> 15:10.821
-Fuck you, I don't even get
my pension, you get my pension.

15:19.450 --> 15:20.496
-Yeah.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.320
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:08.290 --> 16:09.325
-You cut your hair?

16:10.370 --> 16:11.610
-No, I didn't.

16:11.660 --> 16:12.945
Well, it looks good.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.780
Remember that one?

16:18.870 --> 16:19.825
-Yeah.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.115
-Scotch?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.616
-Uh, no, thank you.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.651
-Well, I'm going to have one.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.321
-I thought you
quit drinking.

16:31.370 --> 16:32.530
-I did.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.497
So, how's work?

16:39.830 --> 16:40.945
-Uh, work's fine.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.946
-Good. Good.
And how are things
with--

16:44.000 --> 16:46.150
-Taylor.
-I know. Taylor.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.649
You guys doing okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

16:50.580 --> 16:51.820
Why am I here?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.536
Are you sick?
Why did you call me?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.496
-How about we go
for a ride?

17:13.580 --> 17:14.820
-What are we doing?

17:16.500 --> 17:20.038
-Uh, Nick, you know what
I do. You know where
I get my money.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.946
Well, I'm out of options.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.991
The feds are all
the way up my ass.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.321
You are the only
person I can trust.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.190
There's over
two million dollars here.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.036
I need you to move it.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.786
-What?

17:42.830 --> 17:45.287
-There's routing numbers.
Instructions on where to
funnel the money.

17:45.330 --> 17:48.242
I just need it
to land by next Tuesday.
-Oh, my God. Pull the car over!

17:48.290 --> 17:50.360
-You go through Valencia--
-Do it yourself!

17:50.410 --> 17:52.742
-They froze all my BFO accounts.
-I'm not kidding.

17:52.830 --> 17:55.196
-But you can move it,
and nobody would ever
see a trace of it.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.992
-Pull the car over right now!
Just pull the car over!
-Fine!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.285
Wait!

18:01.120 --> 18:06.148
-My entire life, I have tried
to atone for all your bullshit,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.993
and make something
decent of myself.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.244
Why do you insist
on dragging me down
with you?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.741
It's not going to happen.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.781
-They're going to kill me.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.446
I lose this money,
it gets seized.

18:25.950 --> 18:28.111
I'm going to owe some
very dangerous people.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.650
If something happens...

18:32.700 --> 18:34.361
you really want that
hanging over your head?

18:54.790 --> 18:55.825
-Dada...

18:58.950 --> 19:02.408
guess what? Touie want
me to show you something.
Guess what it is?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.788
-Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:10.410 --> 19:12.617
-Your brother tell
you to do that?
-Yeah.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.151
-You sure? You sure?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.491
-If you're lying,
I'm going to find out.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.150
I'm going to tickle
you again.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.321
Hey, Touie, you tell your
sister to squirt me?

19:36.330 --> 19:37.490
-No.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.240
-Hey, Els, your brother
done sold you out.

19:39.290 --> 19:40.826
Touie!

19:40.870 --> 19:42.690
What time did you
get home last night?

19:42.750 --> 19:44.286
-Before you did, Pop.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.037
Hey, breakfast will be
ready soon, okay?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.616
- Okay.
- All right.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.571
-Good morning, love.
-Good morning.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.746
Ooh.

19:56.870 --> 19:58.155
Uh-uh. Quit it.

19:59.660 --> 20:00.991
-Touie, who's that?

20:01.040 --> 20:02.325
Oskar.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.649
-What's up?

20:16.660 --> 20:19.402
Got that Towner, dawg.
Right where you say
he'd be.

20:19.450 --> 20:21.532
-Where he at now?
-The room.

20:22.580 --> 20:23.695
-Hold on.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.991
-What up, dawg?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.109
-What they do, 0?

20:32.410 --> 20:34.071
-Oh, shit, yo!

20:34.120 --> 20:36.361
This game dope.
When'd you get this?

20:36.410 --> 20:38.651
-Last week.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.036
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.115
Stop it.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.941
-Hey, turn it off.
Get something to eat.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.326
What'd Jey have to say?

21:34.370 --> 21:36.497
-He's still in Tampa.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.651
He didn't pick up his phone.
Came to get you.

21:45.830 --> 21:48.196
-How long he been there?

21:48.250 --> 21:50.821
-A few hours.
Ain't been talking
much though.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.326
-What they do, big man?

21:54.370 --> 21:56.031
-Those Tam's ribs?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.616
-Last of 'em.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.992
Shit's outta
control out here.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.689
Luclq sumbitch,
ya know that, right?

22:01.750 --> 22:02.990
-She reminds me every day.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.406
-What's up, Big Ronnie?

22:05.500 --> 22:06.990
You hear we
got that Towner?

22:07.040 --> 22:09.941
-Think I'm doin' here, E?
-Gonna do to 'im, Big Dog?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.365
-That's up to him
now, ain't it?

22:11.450 --> 22:12.610
-All right.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.821
-Whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, easy, now.

22:32.870 --> 22:35.407
Shit'll cut you up.
Bleed out 'fore we start.

22:45.370 --> 22:48.362
-Just breathe, my nigga,
just breathe.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.822
I ain't like the rest
of these fools though.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.155
I'm just here to talk.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.820
You like French toast?

23:00.660 --> 23:02.787
My wife, she's a helluva cook.

23:02.830 --> 23:04.491
You don't need no syrup
on this shit or nothing.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.151
This shit just
melt in your mouth.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.992
She learned from her
old girl. A real Haitian.
Try some.

23:11.450 --> 23:12.610
You good?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.242
See now, Mo.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.036
You done made
my breakfast all cold.

23:30.330 --> 23:31.991
I need something
to heat this up with.

23:37.660 --> 23:40.151
Now I'd like to go back
and finish the rest of it
before it all get cold, too.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.909
So I'll make this quick now.
Who shot Joelle?

23:43.950 --> 23:45.577
- I don't know.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.905
-Yeah, you do.
You do know.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.498
-I don't.
I really don't.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.691
-Revis and his boys call
all the shots, but you
and Lowe and the rest

23:52.750 --> 23:54.286
do the dirty work,
ain't that right?

23:57.620 --> 23:58.826
Ah, see.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.286
Now I can warm my shit up.

24:01.330 --> 24:02.570
Thanks, yo.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.149
-Please.

24:16.290 --> 24:19.999
-Oh, damn, Mo,
look at that.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.151
-Look at that shit.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.243
All right. All right.
Shit happens
sometimes, okay.

24:27.830 --> 24:29.821
Nigga got a secret.

24:29.910 --> 24:33.243
He knows what a G-code
like me's_willin' to _do
to get it. Ain't that right?

24:33.290 --> 24:34.609
-I can't.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.537
-Come on, Mo.

24:36.580 --> 24:38.320
You already done
pissed yourself.

24:38.370 --> 24:39.826
It can't get
much worse.

24:39.870 --> 24:42.327
-Come on, dawg.
You know I can't.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.901
-All right, then,
I'll just dry your
shit off.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.900
-Hold still! Hold still!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.991
-Last chance, Mo.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.151
Then I burn that shit off,
I eat that for breakfast
instead, you feel me?

25:03.790 --> 25:04.996
-I can't.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.899
-What did you say?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.820
-Davis.
-DaVIs.

25:25.830 --> 25:28.492
My nigger.

25:28.540 --> 25:31.998
You did good.
You did good, blood,
you did good.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.366
Cut him loose, make sure
he get back across 95.

25:34.410 --> 25:35.820
-Say what?
-You heard me.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.149
- That ain't how we do.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.787
-I'm the one who
say how we do.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.650
-Jey-Jey'd want me
to waste 'im.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.651
-He didn't kill nobody.
Davis did. Eye for an eye.
That's how we do--

25:49.750 --> 25:52.287
-And I ain't with this
Old Testament shit, dawg.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.399
Now when Jey-Jey
gets back--

25:53.450 --> 25:54.747
-It's on me.

25:56.330 --> 25:58.241
You understand?

25:58.290 --> 25:59.609
When Jey-Jey get back...

26:00.750 --> 26:01.865
it's on me.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.196
Now untie him.

26:20.290 --> 26:24.363
Make sure he get back over
the bridge to Overtown without
no trouble, and that's it.

26:28.580 --> 26:31.322
Y'all go on workin'
your corners, selling
kush up to Ybor,

26:31.410 --> 26:33.787
do whatever the fuck
it is you'll do up there.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.492
We going to do what
we do down here,
you understand that?

26:36.540 --> 26:37.495
All right.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.820
-Hey. Good morning.
-Hey.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.239
Can I finish this?

27:17.290 --> 27:19.155
-I'll make some more.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.781
-You working today?

27:20.830 --> 27:22.570
-Yeah, I gotta go
and help Sheena.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.076
She got overwhelmed.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.906
But I'll be home
in time for dinner.

27:25.950 --> 27:27.440
You want to do
some boxes?

27:27.500 --> 27:30.492
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.189
-Have a good one. Bye.
-Bye. You, too.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.115
-Miss Morales?
-Yeah.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.116
-They're ready for you.
-Thank you.

28:33.500 --> 28:38.153
Did you know that
in Saudi Arabia a woman can't
open her own bank account?

28:38.250 --> 28:43.278
In Indonesia, the instability
of the rupee makes it impossible
to maintain a business.

28:43.330 --> 28:48.324
But what if, what if
there was a currency
they all had access to?

28:48.370 --> 28:50.281
A currency they could
call their own.

28:50.330 --> 28:54.243
A currency with no borders,
free of government decree,

28:54.290 --> 28:57.362
with no threat
of confiscation.

28:57.410 --> 29:00.038
Did you know?
50% of the world population,

29:00.080 --> 29:04.198
that's three and a half
billion people, don't have
access to a bank account,

29:04.250 --> 29:08.949
but by 2020, almost
all of them will have
a cell phone.

29:10.330 --> 29:11.445
That's power.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.194
That's GenCoin.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.616
-Uh, sorry, is it
like PayPal?

29:19.660 --> 29:22.447
-No, PayPal is an online
payment system.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.946
It works with whatever
currency you put in it.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.867
GenCoin is a currency
in and of itself.

29:27.910 --> 29:31.653
It runs off a complex
algorithm. It took me
almost seven years to develop.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.282
It predicts, it adjusts
and adapts to foreign markets

29:34.330 --> 29:36.901
and political shifts
in order to remain stable.

29:36.950 --> 29:39.828
Here's what's up--
folks are always saying that

29:39.830 --> 29:41.650
money corrupts people.

29:41.700 --> 29:45.363
But what everyone fails
to recognize is that
people corrupt money.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.492
GenCoin can put
an end to that.

29:47.540 --> 29:52.864
It offers more stability,
security and anonymity than
any digital currency out there.

29:52.950 --> 29:54.531
-And it works?

29:54.620 --> 29:57.157
-Still in beta,
but it works.

29:57.250 --> 30:01.493
-Um, how much would you need
to get started? What are you
looking for?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.616
-$100,000 in seed money.

30:03.660 --> 30:07.448
That'll allow me to build
a secure enough network
to run a true prototype.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.196
With that, I can lure
larger investors.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.037
Eventually, I'll need
12 million.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.243
-That sounds very interesting,
but I have just one concern,

30:16.290 --> 30:19.282
all this BitCoin,
crypto-currency stuff.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.821
I've been reading up on it
and if I may,

30:21.830 --> 30:24.321
its ultimate success
looks pretty--

30:24.370 --> 30:27.658
Well, it just looks pretty grim
for the banking community.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.999
-Well, look at the record
companies, the movie studios.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.321
They didn't want to adapt
to the digital age.

30:33.330 --> 30:37.699
Now they're getting smoked
by Spotify, Netflix, YouTube.

30:37.790 --> 30:42.614
It's the same thing.
Traditional banking,
digital currency.

30:42.660 --> 30:44.787
That train is leaving
the station, my friends,

30:44.830 --> 30:47.867
so you either jump on-board
or get left behind.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.748
-Well, very intriguing.

30:56.790 --> 30:59.532
We're going to chat
internally.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.617
Yeah? And then we will
circle back with you.

31:02.660 --> 31:03.649
Okay?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.492
-Thank you very much.
It was great.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.649
-Right.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.992
- You've reached Andrew Talman.
Please leave a message.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.696
-Andrew? Are you
fucking kidding me?

32:10.580 --> 32:12.366
Pnck.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.287
-This girl's so smart.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.537
I mean, child prodigy,
went to Stanford,

32:16.580 --> 32:18.866
she just has absolutely
no idea how to sell herself.

32:18.910 --> 32:21.196
-Yeah, but there has to be
a reason why people
aren't buying.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.400
Like, you're the only one.

32:23.450 --> 32:27.898
-I think it's a, sort of,
inclination to be afraid of what
you don't know or understand,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.537
and I think it's people scared
of the future. I think-- Yeah?
-Yeah. Well...

32:30.580 --> 32:35.995
Okay, I don't really understand
what exactly it is.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.860
-GenCoin?
-Yeah.

32:37.950 --> 32:40.942
-It's a currency.
It's like any other
currency, but it's digital.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.787
Um, it's not tied to any
government or bank.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.786
So, anyone on Earth
can access it.

32:45.830 --> 32:50.494
-And how does it actually
have real life value?

32:50.500 --> 32:54.038
-It has the value that
we collectively ascribe
to it. Same as any of this.

32:54.080 --> 32:58.244
For instance, this bottle
of wine, you know, that
your aunt got us.

32:58.290 --> 33:02.499
We could agree that this
is worth $1000.

33:02.540 --> 33:06.078
-You want me to believe that
it's a $1000 bottle of wine?
-Or ifI said, it's worth $1000

33:06.120 --> 33:09.829
for me to part with it,
and you said, it's worth
$1000 for me to have it.

33:09.870 --> 33:12.077
Then it's worth $1000.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.823
-I get it.
-But-- I know you do.

33:15.870 --> 33:19.328
I know you do.
-But I still would not pay $1000
for that shitty bottle of wine.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.036
-We're drinking it.
-We are.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.149
Cheers to...

33:28.080 --> 33:31.322
the start of the next
chapter together.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.570
-Cheers.

33:33.830 --> 33:36.071
-I love you.
-I love you.

34:04.330 --> 34:05.786
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.616
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

34:07.660 --> 34:09.821
It's all that wine.
-It's okay.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.945
It's okay.
-Hang on.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.780
-It's okay.
-Hang on.

34:23.830 --> 34:25.320
-It's okay.

34:29.290 --> 34:30.405
-I'll be back.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.326
-Oh, you don't--

34:33.370 --> 34:35.156
You don't have
to do that.

34:36.660 --> 34:37.991
Okay.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.288
-Hello?
-Hi. Is this Izzy Morales?

35:30.330 --> 35:31.490
-Yea h?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.286
-Hey, this is Nick Talman.

35:33.330 --> 35:35.992
We met earlier today.
You came in for a pitch.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.905
-Yeah.

35:38.950 --> 35:41.327
-Um, look, I'm sorry
to call so late,

35:41.370 --> 35:42.906
can I buy you
lunch tomorrow?

35:45.330 --> 35:47.286
-I thought you
guys passed.

35:47.330 --> 35:50.993
-This is not Valencia talking.
This is just me. Iwould like
to buy you lunch.

37:20.500 --> 37:24.869
-Big man. What it do.
-What it do.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.650
-Come on.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.820
Straight? You all right?

37:30.830 --> 37:32.115
-All good.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.822
What Sid have to say?

37:37.790 --> 37:40.327
Got them things coming down
from ATL next week.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.941
Yo, Oskar told me what
went down yesterday though.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.695
-Disobeyed me.
You know I ain't for that.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.945
-Come on, man.
He do what he knew I'd say.

37:59.330 --> 38:01.821
-Murkin' Towners,
they just gonna come
back at us, Jey.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.650
-You got big dreams,
huh, Big Ronnie?

38:14.700 --> 38:16.748
You dream big, huh?

38:16.790 --> 38:18.496
You making moves
with that money or what?

38:20.080 --> 38:21.570
-Look, dawg,
you know the money good.

38:21.620 --> 38:25.499
-Come on, man,
I trust you, dawg.
I trust you. I know you.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.496
I don't know them
niggers. They ain't Haitian.

38:27.540 --> 38:30.327
-We done been through this,
Jey. Ever since the feds
came up in here--

38:30.370 --> 38:31.906
-I ain't trying to hear
about no feds, though.

38:31.950 --> 38:34.191
-Yeah, but I'm saying, Jey.

38:34.250 --> 38:37.242
We ain't got the muscle that
we used to, and every nigga from
Overtown to Lib City know it.

38:38.660 --> 38:40.651
But you see how
the Cubans do it.

38:40.700 --> 38:44.158
-Yeah, I see they got banks.
I see they got ports,
they got unions, all that.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.988
But Cubans got all that
'cause Uncle Sam say
they do.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.323
But what we got?
What we got? What are
they going to do for us?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.993
Only reason any of this still
here, Haitians back there,
these cribs--

38:56.040 --> 38:59.157
Man, all this
is 'cause of force!

38:59.250 --> 39:02.617
It's 'cause they know not
to fuck with us 'cause we
come at you, dawg.

39:02.660 --> 39:04.491
Pull you out your house
if we have to.

39:07.950 --> 39:09.156
You feel me?

39:11.750 --> 39:12.865
You for that, nigger?

39:17.540 --> 39:18.655
-Yeah, I'm for that.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.649
-Come here.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.576
-How much is this
boy going to need?

39:26.660 --> 39:27.820
-About 20 large.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.866
-All right, I'll go pay
that cracker a visit.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.491
So it starts
as an app, right?
-Mmmmmm.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.947
-And then, obviously we find
a way to entice people,
incentivize users.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.070
-I've already sketched out
a couple of models
in my prospectus.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.496
-I saw that. I know.
It's totally great.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.149
-It's legit, too. My code.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.696
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. No.
I have no doubt.

39:49.750 --> 39:52.617
-But you don't want
to audit it or anything?
-I do, but-- Look.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.946
I'm not investing in the code,
I'm investing in you.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.197
All right? I know what you're
capable of, so I'm investing
in the idea.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.490
Even if the code
didn't work--

39:59.540 --> 40:01.280
-It works!
-I'm sure it does.

40:01.330 --> 40:02.991
-My code is the shit.
-I know.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.656
I'm just saying,
even if it didn't,

40:05.700 --> 40:07.156
with the money
I'm prepared to give you,

40:07.200 --> 40:09.907
we can hire a team
and make this about
more than a code.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.118
We can turn this into something
very real that has the power
to change the world.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.320
-How much money?

40:19.870 --> 40:21.030
Thousand?

40:23.410 --> 40:24.820
-Two million.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.656
-No way. No way.

40:27.660 --> 40:30.447
No, no. This is a joke.
No, you think I'm joking.

40:33.370 --> 40:36.407
-These are routing numbers
to off-shore--
Come here, please.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.827
These are routing numbers
to off-shore bank accounts.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.782
The money's already set up
and ready to be wired.
-Off-shore?

40:41.830 --> 40:44.651
-Yeah, it was given to me
to take care of. I'm trying
to do the right thing.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.031
-I don't want to know
where it came from.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.325
-Are you sure about that?

40:52.500 --> 40:56.652
-I've been to every bank
on Brickell Ave. I've hit up
every lender from here

40:56.700 --> 40:59.191
to Tampa, VCs that
I still know out west.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.497
-I know, they're all scared.
-Yeah, they're scared of what
it can do

41:01.540 --> 41:03.610
to their way of life.
-Sure.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.321
-When they see me,
they see--

41:05.330 --> 41:08.288
-They see an anarchist.
-They see a crazy chonga,
is what they see.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.366
This is my life's work.

41:21.870 --> 41:22.939
A last chance.

41:28.330 --> 41:29.536
-Okay.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.690
-All these here?
-Yeah.

41:46.790 --> 41:49.076
Okay, you know what?
Why are you breaking
'em up like that?

41:49.120 --> 41:51.247
-I'm putting them in
digital shell corps.

41:51.290 --> 41:54.407
That way, anytime we take
money in, it's completely
untraceable.

41:54.450 --> 41:56.782
-Okay, is it...

41:56.830 --> 42:00.402
very, very safe to store
money like that?

42:00.450 --> 42:03.408
-It's more than safe.
I built the encryption.

42:03.450 --> 42:05.406
It's better than what
all the major banks
are using.

42:05.450 --> 42:06.997
-Okay, really?

42:07.040 --> 42:09.190
-Yes, really.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.241
-Positive?_ _
Completely p05itive?

42:11.330 --> 42:15.903
-Would you rather take this
to a bank? I mean, do you
trust me?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.036
-Yeah. Yeah, do it.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.326
-Okay.

42:45.370 --> 42:46.576
Hi, GenCoin.

43:06.830 --> 43:07.945
-Can I help you?

43:09.330 --> 43:11.616
-Yeah. Where Andrew--
Andrew Talman?

43:11.660 --> 43:12.991
-Oh, you just missed him.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.241
He's taken a leave
of absence as of yesterday.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.905
-For how long?

43:18.950 --> 43:20.861
-Um, indefinite.

43:25.620 --> 43:27.360
-Where'd he go?

43:27.410 --> 43:29.116
-Um, I'm not sure.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.650
-Is there something
I can help you with?

43:30.700 --> 43:32.031
-Yeah.

43:34.700 --> 43:36.998
Yeah, we opened up
an account a couple
of weeks ago.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.861
Uh, I just need to take
a little piece of it.

43:39.910 --> 43:43.152
-Uh, did he tell you who
will be managing your
account in his absence?

43:43.160 --> 43:46.323
-He didn't tell me he was
leaving. He wouldn't pick up
his phone. That's why I'm here.

43:46.330 --> 43:47.945
-I see. Okay.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.649
Well, can I get your name?

43:49.700 --> 43:52.828
-Dacey. Ronald Dacey.
D-A-C-E-Y.

43:53.830 --> 43:54.990
-Dacey.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.491
-Is there something wrong?

44:13.540 --> 44:16.191
-When did you say that
you opened the account,
Mr. Dacey?

44:16.250 --> 44:18.901
-Last Wednesday,
I think it was.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.492
-It's just that, um,
there's no record
of you here in our system.

44:27.660 --> 44:28.991
-What they hell
are you talking about?

44:30.500 --> 44:32.570
-Are you sure you're
in the right place?

44:33.750 --> 44:34.944
-Are you for real?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.285
Are you being
for real right now?

44:38.330 --> 44:41.697
-Do you-- Do you still
have the welcome packet?

44:41.750 --> 44:43.900
Did he--
-He didn't give
me no packet.

44:43.950 --> 44:45.247
You think
I'm messing with you?

44:46.830 --> 44:48.320
-No, sir, it's just--

44:48.370 --> 44:49.689
I don't know what
else to tell you.

44:49.750 --> 44:51.570
-You can tell me...

44:56.120 --> 44:57.860
...where my goddamn
money's at.

45:22.830 --> 45:23.990
-Hi, Nick.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.248
Um, there's an Agent Rask
here to see you.

45:27.290 --> 45:28.996
He says he's FBI.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.747
He's already in your office.
I tried to stop him,
but he just--

45:31.790 --> 45:33.439
He went in. _
-You couldn't stop him?

45:33.500 --> 45:34.694
-No.

45:35.830 --> 45:37.149
-What does he want?

45:37.200 --> 45:38.906
-He didn't say.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.821
-What's his name?
Agent Rask. Okay, thank you.
-Agent Rask.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.991
--Agent Rask?

45:52.040 --> 45:54.156
-Call me Phil.
-Okay. Hey.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.498
-Nick, didn't mean to snoop.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.571
-No, no, not at all.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.941
It's what they're there for.
-You ﬁsh?

46:01.000 --> 46:03.321
-Um, you know, I used to,
hard to find the time.

46:03.330 --> 46:04.945
-What is that, tuna?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.695
-Yeah, that is a blue fin.

46:06.750 --> 46:07.899
-All the way
out here?

46:07.950 --> 46:10.828
-No, no, no.
Cape Hatteras, actually.

46:10.870 --> 46:12.826
-You're kidding. We used
to go there every summer.

46:12.870 --> 46:14.406
I didn't know
there was good tuna.

46:14.450 --> 46:17.112
-There's some of
the best actually.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.368
That's got to be satisfying,
right? Pulling something that
big out of the water?

46:20.410 --> 46:21.695
-Oh, yeah, it is.

46:21.750 --> 46:24.537
-Always meant to learn,
but just can't get away.

46:24.580 --> 46:27.037
You know_I haven't had
a vacation in seven years.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.656
-It's brutal.
-Seven.

46:29.660 --> 46:30.945
-Wow.

46:37.910 --> 46:39.821
-Mind if I sit?
-Please, please.

46:42.250 --> 46:44.070
-You're not in trouble
by the way.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.326
-Huh?

46:45.330 --> 46:47.571
-You know
I'm a federal agent, right?

46:47.620 --> 46:50.407
-Yes, that's what
Selby said.

46:50.450 --> 46:52.031
-You look nervous is all.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.695
As if you're in trouble.
You're not.

46:54.870 --> 46:56.280
-No, no, I think--

46:57.750 --> 46:59.194
Maybe the gun,
I don't know.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.535
-Oh, right.

47:07.830 --> 47:08.899
So is that your girl?

47:10.830 --> 47:13.651
-Yes, uh, Taylor
is her name.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.321
-Wife? Fiance? What?

47:15.330 --> 47:16.786
-Just girlfriend for now.

47:16.830 --> 47:18.491
We're not putting--

47:18.500 --> 47:19.819
I mean, that's a label, but I--

47:21.160 --> 47:23.446
-What's a label?
-"Girlfriend."

47:23.500 --> 47:26.788
I was going to say, we're not
putting labels on it, but we are
she's my girlfriend, but--

47:26.830 --> 47:28.536
-Right.
-It's all for right now.

47:28.580 --> 47:30.536
-Well, lock that down.
She's a knockout.

47:30.580 --> 47:32.036
-Yeah. Hey, I'm working on it.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.901
-Good. Good.
Where's your dad?

47:38.870 --> 47:41.657
We had a meeting.
He didn't show.

47:41.700 --> 47:45.363
Can't find him.
It's like he's skipped town.
So I'm wondering, where'd he go?

47:46.500 --> 47:47.535
-Huh.

47:50.500 --> 47:53.947
Well, I don't-- I--

47:54.000 --> 47:55.319
I can't say I know.

47:55.370 --> 47:56.689
We hardly talk anymore.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.030
-Except for the other night.

47:59.540 --> 48:02.498
-We did. We did
talk the other night.

48:02.580 --> 48:04.571
-So what did you guys
talk about, your dad
and you?

48:04.620 --> 48:08.784
-I think it was mostly,
ifI recall, it was mostly
a catch-up.

48:10.540 --> 48:12.326
He definitely didn't say
anything about leaving town.

48:12.370 --> 48:15.533
-So just small talk then?
Again, you're not in trouble.

48:15.580 --> 48:16.865
-Is he in trouble?

48:16.910 --> 48:18.366
-He teach you how
to fish, your dad?

48:18.410 --> 48:21.994
-Um, he did, a long time ago.
-That's great.

48:22.040 --> 48:25.532
It's nice, you know,
it's important to have those
memories of your old man.

48:25.580 --> 48:28.037
See, my dad,
he shot himself
when I was off at school.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.901
.38, under the chin, pow.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.821
-Jesus.
-Dumb bastard, couldn't
even do that right.

48:33.870 --> 48:38.318
The bullet ricocheted off his
jawbone, took out his left eye,
ripped off a piece of his brain,

48:38.370 --> 48:40.110
didn't kill him
straight away,

48:40.160 --> 48:42.993
he had to be on a vent
for two whole months
before he passed.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.573
Two goddamn months with
all of us just standing around
watching him fill a bag

48:47.620 --> 48:49.326
with shit waiting
for him to go.

48:51.700 --> 48:53.156
-My God.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.828
-Huh?
-I said, my God, that's--

48:55.870 --> 48:57.781
That's awful.
-If there is a god.

48:59.410 --> 49:00.820
What kind of god, right?

49:00.870 --> 49:05.034
-Right. It's a great question
for another time, maybe.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.992
-There'll be another time.
I don't want to keep you.

49:09.040 --> 49:14.489
-Oh, uh, listen, no problem,
let me know if there's anything
I can do, okay?

49:14.500 --> 49:16.695
-If you hear from your dad,
it's really important
I speak to him.

49:16.790 --> 49:19.361
-Yeah. Absolutely.

49:20.790 --> 49:22.826
-So what'd you use?

49:22.870 --> 49:24.246
-What did I use?

49:24.290 --> 49:26.656
_ -To catch the tuna? _
Not just worms, I'm assuming.

49:26.660 --> 49:29.948
-No, not worms.
I use herring.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.900
Sometimes I go with scad.

49:31.950 --> 49:34.157
-So just smaller fish then?
-Yeah.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.327
-Right. Hmm.

49:36.370 --> 49:37.940
You know, one of these days
I'm going to retire,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.945
you're going to take me
out there, show me
a thing or two.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.991
-Okay. It's a deal.
-What?

49:43.540 --> 49:44.609
-I will.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.439
If you want, I can...

49:49.660 --> 49:51.571
Let me know.

49:51.660 --> 49:54.402
-Huh?
-Let me know. I mean, like,
let me know and I will--

49:54.500 --> 49:58.493
Anytime, really.
I mean, I have to find
the time, but, you know--

49:58.500 --> 50:02.152
You know, doesn't sound like
you're retiring anytime soon,
so...

50:03.660 --> 50:05.787
I'm just saying you
haven't had a vacation.

50:05.830 --> 50:08.572
It seems like you work hard.
They work you.
I know the feeling, so--

50:10.330 --> 50:14.403
But if you find the time,
I will also find the time.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.399
-Thanks, Nick.

50:55.330 --> 50:58.493
- You've reached Andrew Talman.
Please leave a message.

50:58.540 --> 51:00.360
You've reached
Andrew Talman.

51:19.700 --> 51:22.157
-You've reached
Andrew Talman--
-Goddammit!

52:09.200 --> 52:11.077
-Help! Help! Help! Help!

52:14.450 --> 52:17.157
I've been sleeping
at night

52:22.620 --> 52:25.942
With my dick in my hands

52:30.790 --> 52:34.078
I am worried for my plans

52:38.660 --> 52:43.529
More than anything

52:46.660 --> 52:50.152
If you do not
want to fuck me

52:54.450 --> 52:58.819
But I know_
'cause I see it
in your eyes

53:02.620 --> 53:06.693
But I am left convinced

53:10.410 --> 53:14.153
I'm only one
to despise

53:24.580 --> 53:27.697
I'm the reason you're here

53:30.450 --> 53:33.613
Fill my confidence
