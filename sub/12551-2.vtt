I love you.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.385
-I remember it all, you know.
-Sorry?

26:27.452 --> 26:28.987
The Sontaran.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.756
What really
happened with my shoe.

26:31.823 --> 26:34.192
Don't worry,
I won't say anything.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.529
They deserve a new start.
We all do.

26:37.595 --> 26:38.630
Thank you.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.543
LUKE: I'll miss her.

26:51.609 --> 26:54.546
Yeah, me, too.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.882
I learned a long time ago
that if you're
missing somebody,

26:57.949 --> 27:00.618
just look up at the night sky.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.555
Whoever it is,

27:03.621 --> 27:05.323
wherever they are,

27:05.390 --> 27:08.860
chances are they're looking
at the stars just like you.

27:10.695 --> 27:13.365
Sometimes, for all its size,

27:13.431 --> 27:16.668
the universe isn't such
a big place after all.

27:29.347 --> 27:32.150
Boy, they have no idea what
they're moving in
over the road from.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.953
I'm Rani.
My family just moved into
Bannerman Road.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.755
<i>These kids go missing though,</i>
<i>that is weird.</i>

27:36.821 --> 27:39.124
<i>-And the police</i>
<i>just don't have a clue.</i>
-Hey!

27:39.190 --> 27:44.863
Welcome to Spellman's
Magical Museum of the Circus.
