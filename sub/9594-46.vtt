WEBVTT

00:26.560 --> 00:29.063
Hey, anyone know
what time it is?

00:33.301 --> 00:34.668
Who wants non

00:34.702 --> 00:35.536
I want non-meat!

00:35.569 --> 00:38.806
Get some tofu in your grill!

00:38.839 --> 00:41.075
I want non-meat
that's pretending to be meat!

00:41.109 --> 00:43.811
Then give these veggie dogs
a good home, yo!

00:46.747 --> 00:49.417
Ooh, I want the non-meat
that I can eat!

00:49.450 --> 00:52.052
Then dip into this
vegetarian chili, yo!

00:54.122 --> 00:55.689
I just want to read.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.260
Sounds like you need
some carrots for
your peepers, mama.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.503
And Raven ruins another party.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.839
This non-meat party
is not a party.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.374
It's stupid and derivative.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.276
Why do you have to be
so mean all the time?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.844
You guys
don't even like non-meat.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.380
Of course we don't.
We're just being nice
to Beast Boy.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.814
So you're lying to him?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.350
That's not nice.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.852
Oh, but I do love
the vegetarian chili.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.222
Ugh! If you love it so much,
why don't you marry it?

01:28.256 --> 01:30.391
Marry the chili?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.059
I do love it the so much.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.730
And I could see us
building the life and
growing old together.

01:36.764 --> 01:40.334
What a happy, happy life
we will have together,

01:40.368 --> 01:42.470
dear chili...

01:42.503 --> 01:44.805
Oh, great. Now I have to be
the mean one

01:44.838 --> 01:47.675
and explain to her
why she can't marry
a pot of chili.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.182
Man, I am super-excited
about Star's wedding!

01:54.215 --> 01:56.384
It's just so nice when
a beautiful woman

01:56.417 --> 01:58.686
and a dashing pot of chili
find true love.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.221
There's not
gonna be a wedding.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.490
Did they break up?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.725
No! Raven's just being
mean again.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.860
Phew! So, mama,

02:06.894 --> 02:08.529
you wanna be my date?

02:08.562 --> 02:10.531
I am not going
to a chili wedding.

02:10.564 --> 02:14.168
Would you come if
Starfire was marrying a
chicken

02:14.202 --> 02:15.536
No.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.305
-What if Starfire
married some soup?
-No.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.174
-You guys are starting
to annoy me.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.509
-Last warning.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.577
Corn on la cob.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.882
Hello, hello, hello!

02:28.916 --> 02:31.852
Ugh! My day just keeps
getting better.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.387
What do you want, Dad?

02:33.421 --> 02:36.790
I sensed you causing
great pain and suffering
to your friends and thought,

02:36.824 --> 02:39.760
"Hey, maybe you're finally
ready to devour their souls,

02:39.793 --> 02:42.663
"and join me
in the destruction
of this pitiful world."

02:42.696 --> 02:44.064
Nope.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.400
Why don't you want to destroy
anything with your
father anymore?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.469
Because I'm a nice person.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.404
You

02:52.473 --> 02:54.608
Wait, wait, wait...

02:54.642 --> 02:57.678
I'm sorry, Raven,
but you are mean.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.413
It's the half demon in you.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.483
Maybe I'm not nice,
but I'm not mean either.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.752
I'm "nean."

03:04.785 --> 03:05.719
"Nean"?

03:05.753 --> 03:08.456
Are we just
making up words now?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.657
I can do that too.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.960
Look, I'm a real
Bluzo kind of guy.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.797
"Nean" is being nice
by being mean.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.533
I tell it like it is
when people
are acting ridiculous.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.335
That's dumb. Stop it.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.704
Everybody needs
a "nean" person in their life.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.573
And I'm the neanest.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.476
You're being such
a norblem right now.

03:28.509 --> 03:32.313
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were still
making up fake words.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.781
See, now you're being mean.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.015
Exactly!

03:35.048 --> 03:36.717
And you should be too.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.619
But if you don't want to,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.855
-so be it!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.458
Something tells me
you're about to have

03:44.492 --> 03:47.595
a nice day, Raven.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.600
What's so funny?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.935
I made a pun that will make
sense to you later.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.439
Maybe we'll share
a "nice" laugh about it.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.978
Hey, what time is it?

04:07.648 --> 04:10.984
I cannot. I'm in a committed
non-meat relationship.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.624
Non-meat will upset my belly.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.792
I really just want to know
what time it is.

04:18.826 --> 04:22.062
And I know,
Raven doesn't want any.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.031
I want non-meat.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.536
If you say so, mama.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.442
Mmm...
Keep that non-meat comin'.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.645
Participating in one of
Beast Boy's inane activities.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.680
Why are you
being so nice, Raven?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.517
I don't know.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.087
Whatever the reason,
it means the world to me,
mama.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.922
Tofu in your face!

04:51.425 --> 04:55.696
Uh-oh. I know that look,
Beasty. Run!

04:57.731 --> 04:59.600
Don't leave me hangin'.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.805
Yeah!

05:08.542 --> 05:11.679
Beast Boy, you so crazy!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.847
What is happening to me?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.320
Mmm...

05:21.722 --> 05:24.358
Oh!
Hope I'm not interrupting.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.095
I just wanted to congratulate
the chili on his
upcoming nuptials.

05:28.128 --> 05:32.433
Then I shall
give you a moment to do the

05:32.466 --> 05:34.835
"Bro-out."

05:34.868 --> 05:38.739
Well, you won her heart
fair and square, my good man.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.975
So you think you can steal
Starfire from me

05:42.009 --> 05:44.812
just by being delicious?
Do you Huh?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.515
You think you're so hot.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.350
Well, let's see how hot
you can get.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.622
Looks like
you're starting to sweat.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.592
What'd you say?
Come on bro, say it again.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.127
Say it to my face.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.597
Chili!

06:03.631 --> 06:05.999
Oh, it burns!

06:06.033 --> 06:08.536
Something strange
is happening to me.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.605
When did I start
being so nice?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.610
Friend Raven,
do you have a moment?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.412
Uh, of course, I do. Ugh!

06:18.446 --> 06:21.615
I realize you have the doubts
about my engagement,

06:21.649 --> 06:24.785
but the chili and I hope you
will join us for the wedding.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.388
Of course, I won't.
It's your wedding, Star.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.924
Really?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.694
I was having the
second thoughts, but
if you are so supportive

06:33.727 --> 06:35.796
it must be
the right thing to do.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.132
As long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.400
Wonderful.

06:40.434 --> 06:44.705
Oh, the chili will be
so happy to hear
we have your blessings.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.173
STARFIRE: Chili!

06:47.174 --> 06:50.811
So you get my little pun now?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.046
Remember

06:53.080 --> 06:56.083
-I cursed you so you
could only be nice.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.918
To force you
to make a decision.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.186
Be nice or be mean.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.822
No more this "nean" stuff.
It's not a word.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.058
Thank you for taking
an interest in me,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.760
but I'll have to
get back to you.

07:06.794 --> 07:10.798
Very well. Before I go,
can I get a hug?

07:10.831 --> 07:12.099
Oh.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.768
Oh! That's a good one.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.705
Now, who's the best daddy
in the world?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.808
You are! Ugh!

07:20.841 --> 07:23.143
I kind of
like you this way.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.583
Ugh.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.585
What's wrong, Robin?

07:31.619 --> 07:32.953
Starfire.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.823
I've lost her forever.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.858
That chili is just
too awesome.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.593
It's not too late, you know.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.961
You'll help me sabotage
the wedding?

07:40.994 --> 07:42.896
You don't need
to sabotage anything.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.197
You just need to be yourself.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.868
-But that chili is so cool.
-So are you.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.670
You have so much to offer.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.104
You're right.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.873
I am pretty great.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.708
Thanks, Raven.

07:57.077 --> 08:01.114
Wow. I feel good
because I made him feel good.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.884
Maybe being nice isn't so bad.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.988
Hey, nice face.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.823
-Thanks.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.764
-Great magic trick.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.538
Aw! Cute baby.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.880
Thanks for
the delicious hot dog.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.887
Raven! Flowers?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.822
Are you actually
enjoying yourself?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.191
Being nice is nice.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.694
This was the best thing
you've ever done for me.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.596
Oh, please.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.598
You're only saying that
because of a stupid curse
I put on you.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.667
No, Dad. I don't need
your curse to be nice anymore.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.906
This is not what I intended.
I must remove the curse.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.208
You'll have to catch me first.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.180
Give me that curse!

09:07.214 --> 09:10.217
Well, if it's
the nice thing to do.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.956
Oh, no. A reverse curse.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.858
And I'm back to normal.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.092
Now, if you don't mind,

09:19.126 --> 09:21.995
I'd appreciate if you'd
never bother me again.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.097
Of course, honey.
You need your space.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.835
I understand
completely, boo-boo kitty.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.971
Now, I'm being nice.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.373
How could my plan
backfire so badly?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.943
Yeah, I would have told you
your plan was dumb,
but I couldn't

09:35.976 --> 09:37.344
because it wouldn't
have been nice.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.813
That's why the world needs
"nean" people, Dad,

09:39.847 --> 09:42.816
to keep dumb people
from doing dumb things
all the time,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.718
speaking of which,
I need to go.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.621
Oh, and Dad, have a nice day.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.389
(FANFARE PLAYING
OUT

10:08.876 --> 10:11.078
Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.846
I'd like to say a few words.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.849
This chili wedding
is super dumb.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
There. Someone had to say it.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.222
I knew this chili wasn't
good enough for you. Ha!

10:22.255 --> 10:25.025
I was kind of thinkin' that,
but I didn't want to be mean.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.294
Me too, brah. Me too.

10:27.327 --> 10:31.732
You have ruined
the chili wedding, Raven.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.834
Thank you.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.903
I did not really love
the chili.

10:35.936 --> 10:39.039
Well, someone had to be
the "nean" one.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.080
There, there, chili.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.382
I know it hurts now,
but the right girl for you

10:49.416 --> 10:50.517
is still out there.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.086
Come on, let's go grab
some ice cream.
