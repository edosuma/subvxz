00:10.480 --> 00:15.439
Tonight, Maserati brings
some V8 thunder to our track,

00:16.132 --> 00:18.291
Mercedes brings some smoke

00:18.292 --> 00:21.372
and we wave goodbye to Saab.

00:27.732 --> 00:32.011
Hello... Hello, everybody
and good evening.

00:32.012 --> 00:35.091
Hello and welcome -
thank you so much.

00:35.092 --> 00:36.732
We begin...

00:39.172 --> 00:41.691
We begin with a letter -
thank you, everybody.

00:41.692 --> 00:44.931
It's from a Swiss gentleman
and it says,

00:44.932 --> 00:47.491
"Dear Si Appelli, Top Gear.

00:47.492 --> 00:50.331
"You're more than halfway through
this series

00:50.332 --> 00:53.291
"and yet you still haven't
raced a car

00:53.292 --> 00:56.251
"against something
that isn't a car."

00:56.252 --> 00:59.252
He's right, we haven't -
and we should!

01:04.132 --> 01:10.131
As with our off-road scooters
last week, this race
will take place in Wales.

01:10.132 --> 01:13.571
And this is the rally car
we'll be fielding...

01:13.572 --> 01:16.211
a Skoda Fabia Super 2000.

01:16.212 --> 01:19.611
Last season, this car
dominated the championship,

01:19.612 --> 01:24.371
winning seven of the 12 rallies
and locking out the entire podium

01:24.372 --> 01:26.731
with a 1-2-3 on four
of those occasions.

01:26.732 --> 01:31.411
But although the car is clearly
no slouch, is it any kind of match

01:31.412 --> 01:34.612
for the non-car thing
we've got lined up for today?

01:36.452 --> 01:38.851
In fact, if I were the car,

01:38.852 --> 01:42.611
I might possibly be weeing myself
right now.

01:42.612 --> 01:46.411
Because today,
it will be taking on Yves Rossy,

01:46.412 --> 01:49.412
the world's first jet-powered
flying man.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.491
Yves, I have many questions.

01:53.492 --> 01:56.771
Starting with,
what exactly is this thing?

01:56.772 --> 02:02.971
That's a wing, and to push me in the
air, four engines. It's very simple.

02:02.972 --> 02:10.170
Four jets? Yes. And you steer just
with your moves of arms and legs...

02:10.172 --> 02:13.291
So you haven't got like,
levers to control the...? Nothing.

02:13.292 --> 02:18.571
The only thing is a little throttle
that I have here.

02:18.572 --> 02:25.011
That's the only thing that command.
Well, look, all the best.

02:25.012 --> 02:28.291
Mm-hm. I'll be on the ground. Yeah!

02:28.292 --> 02:32.332
'And THAT brings us neatly to
the actual driving of the car.'

02:33.772 --> 02:37.011
Now obviously, I could take
the wheel of that thing myself

02:37.012 --> 02:39.731
and show that Swiss cuckoo clock
some real talent,

02:39.732 --> 02:42.691
but under the Top Gear
apprentice driver training scheme,

02:42.692 --> 02:47.531
I've agreed to let the guy behind me,
Toni Gardemeister,
cut his teeth on this one.

02:47.532 --> 02:50.451
To be fair, he's pretty good already.

02:50.452 --> 02:51.931
Finnish rally champion.

02:51.932 --> 02:56.051
Many, many World Rally podiums
to his name.

02:56.052 --> 03:00.211
But still keen to get
some tips from me.

03:00.212 --> 03:02.332
So, let's see how this race
will work.

03:06.412 --> 03:10.731
This is the course
the car will be racing around.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.211
Eight miles of prime Welsh
rally stage.

03:14.212 --> 03:19.571
As the car sets off, Yves will climb
to 8,000 feet in a helicopter,

03:19.572 --> 03:22.772
jump out, and then follow
the course from above.

03:25.772 --> 03:29.731
Now, Rocket Man can travel
at a steady 120 miles an hour

03:29.732 --> 03:31.331
and we can't.

03:31.332 --> 03:34.251
Well, I could, but I'm not sure yet
about our novice driver.

03:34.252 --> 03:38.411
Anyway, you might think
because of his cruising speed,
we don't stand a chance,

03:38.412 --> 03:42.491
but there's more to it than that.
At the end of the race,
Yves has to land,

03:42.492 --> 03:44.972
so he has to cut his engines,
deploy his parachute

03:44.973 --> 03:49.171
and all sorts of technical
rocket-man stuff has to happen.

03:49.172 --> 03:51.851
So, trust me,
we're in with a shout here.

03:51.852 --> 03:56.371
'And also, we will be busy
covering precious miles

03:56.372 --> 04:00.091
'whilst his chopper is still
climbing to launch height.'

04:00.092 --> 04:02.532
Just relax, Toni,
I'm here if you need me.

04:05.172 --> 04:09.371
Obviously, Yves could cut a corner
up there, but don't worry,

04:09.372 --> 04:12.171
we've thought of that -
we've put a farmer out there

04:12.172 --> 04:17.211
with an air rifle with strict orders
to shoot him down
if he sees any infringement.

04:17.212 --> 04:19.492
That's FIA rules all sorted.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.772
As the chopper lifted,
the flag dropped.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.211
We're off!

04:28.212 --> 04:29.652
Oh-hoh!

04:35.452 --> 04:37.572
Oh, my God, he's quite confident.

04:42.812 --> 04:44.692
Ye Gods!

04:52.692 --> 04:54.212
Yeah, just as you are.

05:00.572 --> 05:03.572
We are absolutely
monstering this course!

05:07.532 --> 05:12.811
We've got 265bhp down here.
Toni is using, I'd say, all of them!

05:12.812 --> 05:14.332
Yeah - whoaah!

05:15.812 --> 05:20.172
'However, as we passed the three-mile
mark, Yves was ready to jump.'

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074

05:32.692 --> 05:35.132
He's jumped!

05:40.412 --> 05:43.092
Engines are good.

05:56.972 --> 06:00.811
Well, he's dropped,
I can't see him out of the car.

06:00.812 --> 06:04.771
'But somewhere up there,
he was following our course

06:04.772 --> 06:06.372
'and closing the gap.'

06:08.372 --> 06:11.012
Aaargh!

06:13.572 --> 06:16.211
Hello! Just concentrate! OK!

06:16.212 --> 06:21.292
As a new driver, you get giddy,
you show off and it goes wrong. Oh...

06:28.252 --> 06:35.091
Up there, Yves is hitting speeds
of 120, 150, 80 miles an hour.

06:35.092 --> 06:38.931
In just, well, a lycra suit
a small crash helmet

06:38.932 --> 06:41.412
and a kitchen table on his back.

06:49.772 --> 06:54.132
How the hell did I get mixed up in
this? I mean, I'm just baggage now.

06:55.932 --> 06:59.092
'Within seconds, Yves had caught up.'

07:03.852 --> 07:05.852
There he is, there he is!

07:06.932 --> 07:09.092
He's ahead of us, he is ahead.

07:10.572 --> 07:12.132
Ow!

07:14.212 --> 07:16.931
'As Yves streaked into the lead,

07:16.932 --> 07:20.691
'we still had just under
four miles to go.'

07:20.692 --> 07:22.172
Aaaaargh!

07:26.252 --> 07:29.052
In the air... Ooh-argh!

07:33.292 --> 07:34.372
Ye Gods.

07:44.852 --> 07:46.092
Right, OK!

07:47.572 --> 07:52.612
'Up ahead, Yves's journey was,
unfortunately, almost done.'

08:06.812 --> 08:10.012
There he is. There's his parachute.

08:15.532 --> 08:17.531
We've got to just take advantage

08:17.532 --> 08:22.892
while he's slowing through
the air to land. We've got to
give it everything we can.

08:26.532 --> 08:30.211
We've got about two minutes now.
Absolutely...

08:30.212 --> 08:33.211
This is going to be so close!

08:33.212 --> 08:34.212
Oh, my God.

08:35.572 --> 08:36.852
There he is.

08:42.812 --> 08:44.612
He's behind the hill.

08:46.572 --> 08:51.051
He's behind the trees,
I don't know, he's not down yet.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.972
We still have a chance here.

08:54.292 --> 08:58.132
This is it. Where is he?
Where is he? Is he there?

09:00.252 --> 09:04.172
Oh no! After all that!

09:05.532 --> 09:07.931
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

09:07.932 --> 09:12.731
Don't blame yourself. That's the main
thing, man - don't blame yourself.

09:12.732 --> 09:16.571
You did a great job. Thanks for
the guiding. I was there for you.

09:16.572 --> 09:19.651
Thank you. I'm going to sit here
for a little bit now, just...

09:19.652 --> 09:21.571
You look a little bit dark now.

09:21.572 --> 09:24.532
Yeah, do you know, I'm just going to
sit here for a minute.

09:28.012 --> 09:29.852
BLEEP!

09:37.692 --> 09:42.771
Was that a bit scary? Yes!
Very. It's so fast.

09:42.772 --> 09:46.251
You said at one point,
something was getting loose.

09:46.252 --> 09:50.531
Yeah, me - my bowels, specifically!
It was really scary.

09:50.532 --> 09:53.651
But what gets me about Yves, flying,
is there must have been

09:53.652 --> 09:58.491
a first time he did that - you can't
work up to being a jet-powered man.

09:58.492 --> 10:00.331
You can't start with propellers.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.731
Oh, no!
So there must've been a first day.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.331
He woke up one day and thought,
right, it's today.

10:05.332 --> 10:08.851
I'm going to jump off a helicopter
with a kitchen table strapped

10:08.852 --> 10:13.251
to my back and a couple of jets
and I'm pretty confident I can fly.

10:13.252 --> 10:17.571
Anyway, we must now do the news
and we begin with this.

10:17.572 --> 10:19.971
What is the worst thing
in the world?

10:19.972 --> 10:21.331
Trying on trousers.

10:21.332 --> 10:23.731
He's right, actually. You're right.

10:23.732 --> 10:27.891
But the second worst thing
in the world is when you're
going on a journey somewhere

10:27.892 --> 10:30.372
and someone in the car says,
"do you mind if we stop"

10:30.373 --> 10:33.091
for some reason - "look,
there's an ancient monument".

10:33.092 --> 10:37.611
I don't want to look at that!
I want to look at my friends who
we haven't seen for five years.

10:37.612 --> 10:40.291
You're absolutely right.
There are some people

10:40.292 --> 10:44.651
who stop on a journey at a motorway
services to play a fruit machine.

10:44.652 --> 10:47.531
Those people who say,
"I need to stretch my legs".

10:47.532 --> 10:51.851
If you're Alec Guinness
and you've been in a box in a
Japanese prison for six months, yes,

10:51.852 --> 10:55.611
you need to stretch your legs, but
after 30 miles in a car, you don't.

10:55.612 --> 10:58.131
It's when people say
they need to stop to eat. Why?

10:58.132 --> 11:02.131
I can't imagine a journey long enough
that means YOU will need refuelling.

11:02.132 --> 11:06.491
Well, if you were driving
from Cairo to Khartoum...
Yes, but not in Britain.

11:06.492 --> 11:11.371
If you're going from Leicester to
Birmingham, you don't need food.
You won't starve in that time.

11:11.372 --> 11:14.811
No, and I'm glad you brought this up
because this is where I'm going, OK?

11:14.812 --> 11:17.691
One place I could never understand
why people stopped at

11:17.692 --> 11:21.771
was Little Chef, because what
they did was they took ingredients

11:21.772 --> 11:24.531
and then ruined them.

11:24.532 --> 11:27.891
I once stopped at a Little Chef
very early in the morning

11:27.892 --> 11:30.051
and I said,
"Could I have an omelette?"

11:30.052 --> 11:33.211
The woman said, "No, I'm sorry sir,
the powder hasn't arrived yet".

11:33.212 --> 11:35.211
That's not a good sign, is it?!

11:35.212 --> 11:40.051
I once dropped a sausage from my
plate in Little Chef and it bounced.

11:40.052 --> 11:44.211
They made it out of
old squash balls!

11:44.212 --> 11:49.451
The other day, we heard they'd shut
getting on for half their outlets,

11:49.452 --> 11:55.011
and we weren't surprised,
but the other day we stopped at one
that was still open.

11:55.012 --> 11:57.211
I went in and this guy gave me
a paper cup,

11:57.212 --> 11:59.411
he said it's a casserole mash.

11:59.412 --> 12:04.251
I thought, that's just going to be
bits of placenta...

12:04.252 --> 12:05.731
Oh, God!

12:05.732 --> 12:08.771
Garnished with the chef's
bodily fluids. Nice.

12:08.772 --> 12:13.372
It was the second nicest thing
I've ever put in my mouth. Second?

12:14.932 --> 12:19.491
OK. It was brilliant.
I loved it, to be honest.

12:19.492 --> 12:23.451
It's because they've got
Heston Blumenthal doing the menu.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.852
Yes, he cut his teeth,
didn't he, in Heston services?

12:27.332 --> 12:32.651
BMW has sent us news of a new Mini.
It's a concept, here's a picture.

12:32.652 --> 12:36.091
It's a twee little van
with "Buckingham" picked out

12:36.092 --> 12:39.211
in old-fashioned sign writing
and it looks like

12:39.212 --> 12:43.491
the sort of thing we might have been
driving just after we won the war.

12:43.492 --> 12:46.571
Oh, for God's sake, please!
Don't go there. Won it.

12:46.572 --> 12:50.171
Don't go there.
They've done this before, BMW.

12:50.172 --> 12:52.452
A year or so ago they did a Mini,
but at the back,

12:52.453 --> 12:56.571
it had a wickerwork picnic hamper
and a silver tea set.

12:56.572 --> 12:59.931
The point is, we would like
to extend an invitation to

12:59.932 --> 13:03.251
people of Germany to come over here,
not in a bomber...

13:03.252 --> 13:07.451
Not all at once. Not in uniform,
marching... And not at night.

13:07.452 --> 13:11.091
No, not at night,
but come over here as tourists

13:11.092 --> 13:14.971
and we'll show you the Shard,
for example, in London.
Modern skyscraper.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.131
We'll show you the Range Rover
Evoque.

13:17.132 --> 13:19.971
We'll take you to an Adele gig.
Maybe not Adele.

13:19.972 --> 13:23.932
Not if ITV are covering it,
cos you'll just get that...

13:25.892 --> 13:28.332
Then there'll be an advert
for panty liners.

13:34.652 --> 13:37.971
Germans need to come here,
they really do - to come here

13:37.972 --> 13:41.651
and understand we're not driving
around in twee little vans,

13:41.652 --> 13:45.131
tugging our forelocks
at the squire any more.

13:45.132 --> 13:47.371
They're obsessed with this,
bless them.

13:47.372 --> 13:52.331
They always say, "ve love your
England, viz your tweed and your
little houses mit-out electricity".

13:52.332 --> 13:55.251
We should go to Germany with
mullets and leather shorts

13:55.252 --> 13:59.171
and wander about whistling Scorpion
tunes and see how they like it.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.692
Racial stereotyping -
which we don't do.

14:02.732 --> 14:06.211
News from the Continent!
I've always wanted to say that.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.931
"News from the Continent."

14:07.932 --> 14:11.531
The French have announced that
from July 1, you must, by law,

14:11.532 --> 14:14.851
carry a breathalyser kit
in your car.

14:14.852 --> 14:16.971
You can understand
the logic behind that

14:16.972 --> 14:20.131
until you think about it carefully,
and then there's a flaw.

14:20.132 --> 14:24.451
You come out of the bar,
you've had a glass of wine and
you think, "am I OK for driving?"

14:24.452 --> 14:26.971
You use your breathalyser kit,
it says yes, you are,

14:26.972 --> 14:30.171
but then you can't drive,
cos you've used your kit.

14:30.172 --> 14:31.771
It's a one-shot deal?

14:31.772 --> 14:35.571
You'd have to walk to the chemist
and buy another kit
before you set off.

14:35.572 --> 14:38.771
Don't they also make us carry
warning triangles?

14:38.772 --> 14:43.291
Yes, and in France, you've also got
to carry a full set of spare bulbs
and a high-visibility vest.

14:43.292 --> 14:48.571
Aren't all those things the police's
job? Do they want us to stick some
cones in the car, just in case?

14:48.572 --> 14:51.611
And maybe a radio, a notepad,
and a pencil?

14:51.612 --> 14:53.891
But, if they're turning us all
into policemen,

14:53.892 --> 14:57.731
we could stop other motorists
and help ourselves to
130 of their euros.

14:57.732 --> 15:00.931
Yes, we could stop Brits
on the last tolls before Calais,

15:00.932 --> 15:05.011
who are rushing to get the ferry
and have been speeding.

15:05.012 --> 15:08.131
Has anyone here
been caught speeding in France?

15:08.132 --> 15:11.131
It's like saying,
has anyone been to France? Yes.

15:11.132 --> 15:15.372
Would you have to carry
handcuffs and a big truncheon
as well? No, that's Holland.

15:18.332 --> 15:23.091
Now, Richard, tell me, when
you go to work at the BBC in
London, where do you park your car?

15:23.092 --> 15:25.971
Well, I park it in the car park
at the BBC, underground,

15:25.972 --> 15:28.891
where everybody else parks.
Where do you park?

15:28.892 --> 15:33.771
I park in the underground car park.
It's a bit of a walk,
but that's what you do.

15:33.772 --> 15:36.091
Now there is a loading bay
outside our office

15:36.092 --> 15:39.051
which is more convenient
but there is no parking there.

15:39.052 --> 15:42.771
Now I took a photograph in this
loading bay this week. Here it is...

15:42.772 --> 15:46.251
We may recognise this car
if the watch The Apprentice.

15:46.252 --> 15:48.931
It belongs to Lord Sir Sugar.

15:48.932 --> 15:52.651
His chauffeur was probably loading
him into the building then. Exactly.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.651
Technically this was a delivery.
So that's fine.

15:55.652 --> 15:58.091
More worrying is this.
OK, if we zoom in...

15:58.092 --> 16:00.131
Now, right there
is a little Fiat Panda,

16:00.132 --> 16:04.251
part blocking the door
of the honest working men

16:04.252 --> 16:07.051
whose job it is
to deliver things to the BBC.

16:07.052 --> 16:10.251
And I'm wondering, Hammond,
who has a little black Fiat Panda?

16:10.252 --> 16:13.491
I don't know. At the BBC?

16:13.492 --> 16:15.051
I don't know.

16:15.052 --> 16:18.211
Does David Attenborough?
No, he doesn't. Paxman?

16:18.212 --> 16:21.291
Moving on, the most
important news of the week.

16:21.292 --> 16:25.331
Road safety campaigners are
always telling us that driving
is extremely difficult.

16:25.332 --> 16:29.211
It's so difficult that you
couldn't possibly do
something else at the same time.

16:29.212 --> 16:31.811
But we disagree with this.
We think driving is easy

16:31.812 --> 16:35.731
and you can do pretty much
anything while you are driving
in perfect safety.

16:35.732 --> 16:38.491
We do, and a couple of weeks ago
he said to prove that point,

16:38.492 --> 16:41.971
he would drive around a track
while sewing a button onto his shirt.

16:41.972 --> 16:45.371
- OK, who'd like to see me try that?
- Yes!

16:45.372 --> 16:47.571
Here we go, we have got it on tape.

16:47.572 --> 16:48.772
'This is a Suzuki Swift.

16:48.773 --> 16:51.771
'There's me at the wheel
sewing a button on as I drive.'

16:51.772 --> 16:54.291
I will try
and get back underneath again

16:54.292 --> 16:56.851
before we get to the Hammerhead
which is tricky

16:56.852 --> 17:00.451
because I've got too many chins
and I can't see what I'm doing.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.251
Memo to self: lose weight.

17:02.252 --> 17:05.731
So there you are, ladies
and gentlemen, you can do it.

17:05.732 --> 17:07.212
You can sew a button...

17:09.612 --> 17:11.891
But it goes on a bit. Hold on,

17:11.892 --> 17:14.771
because after you'd said
you'd do that,

17:14.771 --> 17:18.330
James then said he reckoned he could
drive a lap of our track in a car,

17:18.332 --> 17:20.451
whilst in a sleeping bag.

17:20.452 --> 17:23.570
Can you? Well, let's find out.
Oh, here we go.

17:23.571 --> 17:26.851
Here I am driving along in a
Suzuki Swift, exactly as you were.

17:26.852 --> 17:28.611
Are you wearing normal clothes?

17:28.612 --> 17:30.971
No, I'm in a sleeping bag.

17:30.972 --> 17:34.652
Shuffle the wheel.
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

17:35.812 --> 17:37.491
Now tell me, was it easy?

17:37.492 --> 17:39.011
There was only one problem...

17:39.012 --> 17:41.731
that blithering idiot Hammond
has turned the heater up

17:41.732 --> 17:44.051
to full blast
because he thought it was funny.

17:44.052 --> 17:47.411
And of course I can't
reach the knob.

17:47.412 --> 17:49.531
So there we are,
road safety enthusiasts...

17:49.532 --> 17:54.251
proof that you can do
other things while driving.
I'm not suggesting that people do.

17:54.252 --> 17:57.091
Don't drive to work
tomorrow morning in a sack.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.851
But we've just shown
that you can drive while sewing
or in a sleeping bag,

18:00.852 --> 18:03.971
so you can certainly drive
while eating an apple or...

18:03.972 --> 18:07.451
Putting a CD in.
Well, if you still live
in the 1980s, yes, putting a CD in.

18:07.452 --> 18:10.931
Driving is easy! It's not difficult.

18:10.932 --> 18:16.331
Right, no moving on to this -
it is a Maserati GranTurismo

18:16.332 --> 18:23.771
and it is a soft,
floppy and very enormous barge
for people who can't drive.

18:23.772 --> 18:26.011
Our studio director's got one.

18:26.012 --> 18:28.051
Um, I really don't like it at all,

18:28.052 --> 18:30.691
but Maserati
has now scratched its head

18:30.692 --> 18:33.052
and tried something a bit different.

18:43.532 --> 18:49.652
This is what they've come up with -
the GranTurismo MC Stradale.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.171
It's still vast.

18:55.172 --> 18:58.931
The gap between the wheels is longer
than it is on a Range Rover

18:58.932 --> 19:02.852
and even beyond the wheels,
look, it just keeps on going.

19:04.652 --> 19:09.052
Still, it's now been lowered
and lightened and stiffened.

19:12.172 --> 19:17.491
So theoretically, it's become
a proper no-nonsense road racer.

19:17.492 --> 19:20.772
It even has a button marked "Race"
on the dashboard.

19:29.132 --> 19:32.811
That speeds up the gear changes,
backs off the traction control

19:32.812 --> 19:35.732
and turns the exhaust
all the way up to 11.

19:39.532 --> 19:42.291
Under the bonnet,
the V8 has been tweaked

19:42.292 --> 19:46.731
so it's now firing 444 horsepower
at the rear wheels.

19:46.732 --> 19:50.292
And the results of all this
are dramatic.

20:04.572 --> 20:07.451
The standard car
is like a duvet on a hot night,

20:07.452 --> 20:11.011
flopping about everywhere,
being annoying.

20:11.012 --> 20:16.412
This, though, in race mode,
this is as tidy as a Marine's bunk.

20:20.812 --> 20:25.491
You can sense that the suspension
is doing battle

20:25.492 --> 20:28.451
with the bulk of the thing.

20:28.452 --> 20:33.851
But you can also sense it's a battle
that the suspension is winning.

20:33.852 --> 20:36.812
There's a majesty to the way
this car drives.

20:38.892 --> 20:40.972
And it feels like it has a soul,
too.

20:42.932 --> 20:44.251
Ooh-ooh!

20:44.252 --> 20:46.332
Oooh, I like you.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.971
Oh, and Joe Walsh was wrong.

20:49.972 --> 20:55.172
Because my Maserati
actually does 187.

20:56.532 --> 21:01.011
So, it goes brilliantly
and thanks to carbon brakes...

21:01.012 --> 21:03.452
it stops just as well.

21:04.412 --> 21:08.011
However, if you want a road racer,

21:08.012 --> 21:11.331
you should know
there's a new alternative

21:11.332 --> 21:15.732
from the dour, sensible, no-nonsense
Germans at Mercedes-Benz.

21:21.292 --> 21:23.651
This is the C63 Black.

21:23.652 --> 21:26.691
It's the latest
plunge into the world of insanity

21:26.692 --> 21:30.172
from the skunkworks
deep inside the bowels of AMG.

21:36.252 --> 21:39.371
In many ways, it's very similar
to the Maserati.

21:39.372 --> 21:41.851
Both cost around Ј110,000.

21:41.852 --> 21:43.971
Both are two-seaters.

21:43.972 --> 21:46.931
Both have double-clutch gearboxes

21:46.932 --> 21:49.532
and both are jolly fast.

21:59.212 --> 22:01.851
But there are differences.

22:01.852 --> 22:03.052
Big ones.

22:07.932 --> 22:12.851
You look at this car and you take in
the aero tweaks on the front-end,

22:12.852 --> 22:16.011
the nostrils in the bonnet,
the massively flared wheel arches

22:16.012 --> 22:18.811
and the enormous carbon fibre
rear wing.

22:18.812 --> 22:24.291
And you sit in here and you know
you have strengthening braces

22:24.292 --> 22:29.172
and you think, yes,
this IS a full-on racing car.

22:32.372 --> 22:35.131
It isn't. It isn't that.

22:35.132 --> 22:38.332
It isn't even close to that.

22:44.652 --> 22:47.972
No, no, over there. Go over there.
Over there. Go over THERE!

22:50.372 --> 22:53.011
What is that rear wing doing?!

22:53.012 --> 22:57.011
I think it's providing rear-end
lift. There's no grip at all.

22:57.012 --> 22:58.772
It is hilarious!

23:04.372 --> 23:08.771
Through the corners there's
just no way that I can keep up

23:08.772 --> 23:11.931
with the man in the Maserati
because he is driving a racing car

23:11.932 --> 23:17.212
and I...
I'm wrestling a mad yellow bear!

23:18.332 --> 23:21.132
This, honestly, is
Winnie The Pooh with road rage.

23:25.852 --> 23:29.851
I mean, obviously it's much more
spectacular to go round the corner

23:29.852 --> 23:31.252
in a cloud of your own smoke.

23:31.253 --> 23:33.811
But it's slower.

23:33.812 --> 23:37.131
As you can see,
because after every single corner,

23:37.132 --> 23:38.612
he's 300 yards ahead of me.

23:41.932 --> 23:43.331
100 yards ahead.

23:43.332 --> 23:45.131
200 yards ahead.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.492
300 yards ahead.

23:52.732 --> 23:57.691
So on a track,
the Maserati is better.

23:57.692 --> 24:01.651
However, as an everyday road car,
there are some issues,

24:01.652 --> 24:04.932
chief among which
are the racing harnesses.

24:05.972 --> 24:10.011
Look at this - honestly, it's like
something out of an S&M catalogue.

24:10.012 --> 24:12.091
It means
you can't reach the glove box.

24:12.092 --> 24:16.291
You can't reach car park
pay machines or tollbooths.

24:16.292 --> 24:18.651
They couldn't have ruined
the car more

24:18.652 --> 24:21.492
if they'd smeared the carpets
with dog dirt.

24:23.292 --> 24:26.852
And even if you ignore the bondage
gear, all is still not well.

24:28.812 --> 24:33.171
If you take the gearbox
out of race mode

24:33.172 --> 24:35.572
and put it in everyday
"going to the shops" auto,

24:35.573 --> 24:39.291
it sits down there,
in the bowels of the car thinking,

24:39.292 --> 24:44.131
"Now, he's just pulled that lever,
that means I have to do something.

24:44.132 --> 24:48.251
"What is it? I have to bake cake?

24:48.252 --> 24:51.092
"No. Mow the lawn? No."

24:52.852 --> 24:54.611
"I know! I am a gearbox!

24:54.612 --> 24:58.451
"He's pulled the lever,
that means he wants third!"

24:58.452 --> 25:01.651
It's so dim-witted
and slow in normal mode,

25:01.652 --> 25:05.092
it makes the whole car feel like
it isn't joined up properly.

25:06.572 --> 25:11.211
So how does the Mercedes
stack up as a road car?

25:11.212 --> 25:15.091
Well, like the Maserati,
the rear seats have been removed.

25:15.092 --> 25:18.411
But for a fee,
Mercedes will put them back.

25:18.412 --> 25:21.531
They will also - free of charge -
move the steering wheel

25:21.532 --> 25:25.611
and pedals over
to the correct side of the car.

25:25.612 --> 25:28.931
And look at this -
hasn't been invented in Italy yet.

25:28.932 --> 25:32.732
It's called a seatbelt
and it's so simple and easy to use.

25:35.532 --> 25:37.971
And there's more.

25:37.972 --> 25:39.971
It's smaller than the Maserati,

25:39.972 --> 25:42.491
much like Lincolnshire,
so it is easier to park

25:42.492 --> 25:44.771
and it has a fantastic
central command unit

25:44.772 --> 25:49.211
which not only tells you
where you are and what you're
listening to, but also,

25:49.212 --> 25:51.131
if you push this button here,

25:51.132 --> 25:54.531
how much G
you're generating in the bends.

25:54.532 --> 25:57.971
Where the throttle is
and how much brake you're using

25:57.972 --> 26:01.011
AND the condition of your tyres.

26:01.012 --> 26:05.972
What it should say is, "Very poor,
because in the last corner
you turned them all into smoke."

26:07.892 --> 26:10.731
Yes, I'm just taking
the children to school now.

26:10.732 --> 26:12.652
I'm on the school run.

26:13.692 --> 26:17.011
Just turning left
into Acacia Avenue.

26:17.012 --> 26:19.931
The biggest problem though
with this car

26:19.932 --> 26:23.411
is that it's not
what you'd call comfortable.

26:23.412 --> 26:25.971
Honestly, if you want to know
how this car rides,

26:25.972 --> 26:30.611
sit on a piano and asked someone
to push you down that cobbled hill
they used in the Hovis ads.

26:30.612 --> 26:32.771
It's ridiculous!

26:32.772 --> 26:35.091
I actually owned
the predecessor of this car

26:35.092 --> 26:37.851
and I've been saying for years,
it rides too harshly.

26:37.852 --> 26:40.131
And what have they done with
the replacement?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.052
They've made it worse!

26:43.532 --> 26:45.251
So, there we are.

26:45.252 --> 26:48.171
Both these cars
are good fun on the track,

26:48.172 --> 26:51.251
albeit for very different reasons.

26:51.252 --> 26:55.411
But for commuting and shopping
and going out for dinner,

26:55.412 --> 26:57.531
thanks to the ride in the Mercedes

26:57.532 --> 27:00.451
and the gearbox in the Maserati,
no.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.612
Neither of them
work very well at all.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.931
It does have a better petrol tank
than mine.

27:17.932 --> 27:21.811
And the seat belts
are easier to do up. Yeah.

27:21.812 --> 27:24.171
Let me get this one straight,

27:24.172 --> 27:27.691
so you finally admitting that
AMG Mercs are ridiculous?

27:27.692 --> 27:29.491
Well, I mean, if you are me

27:29.492 --> 27:34.411
with my very specific requirements
for a car, it's very good indeed.

27:34.412 --> 27:38.691
Yeah, but quite a lot of people
aren't you, so for all of them?

27:38.692 --> 27:41.371
Well, as I said in the film,
er, it is a bit stiff.

27:41.372 --> 27:44.811
Yeah. Just why don't you tell
the ladies and gentleman

27:44.812 --> 27:46.691
how many laps of track you managed

27:46.692 --> 27:51.331
before the rear tyres went down
to the cambers? There's a very
pretty girl there. Have you seen?

27:51.332 --> 27:54.171
How many lap did you manage of
our track

27:54.172 --> 27:55.572
before the rear tyres were lunched?

27:55.573 --> 27:57.091
Erm...

27:57.092 --> 27:58.411
Four.

27:58.412 --> 28:02.011
- How many? Four.
- Four!

28:02.012 --> 28:03.571
Four laps of the track.

28:03.572 --> 28:05.371
That adds up to 6.8 miles.

28:05.372 --> 28:12.131
That works out at Ј85 a mile,
just in tyres, to run this car. Yes.

28:12.132 --> 28:15.411
And we're now going to have to
man our wallets once more

28:15.412 --> 28:20.971
because it's time to find out
how fast the Mercedes and
the Maserati go around our track.

28:20.972 --> 28:24.891
And that of course means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

28:24.892 --> 28:31.651
Some say that he is the only man
in history to buy a DFS sofa

28:31.652 --> 28:34.012
when there wasn't a sale on.

28:35.732 --> 28:41.011
And that his favourite
boxing venue is Munich Airport.

28:41.012 --> 28:43.411
All we know
is that he's called The Stig!

28:43.787 --> 28:45.486
And they're off.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.905
Now the Maserati is undoubtedly
quicker through the corners,

28:48.906 --> 28:51.385
but the Merc will blitz it
on the straights.

28:51.386 --> 28:54.185
Obviously we are not going to
find out here because, look,

28:54.186 --> 28:57.225
the Merc is already twitching,
and wait for it...

28:57.226 --> 28:59.226
yes, smoke and sliding.

29:03.066 --> 29:06.425
Stig unfortunately still obsessed
with The Archers.

29:06.426 --> 29:08.985
Chicago,
once again the Merc sideways.

29:08.986 --> 29:11.305
They should have called it the Crab.

29:11.306 --> 29:14.025
OK, hard on the brakes
for Hammerhead.

29:14.026 --> 29:16.505
What will happen in here, I wonder?

29:16.506 --> 29:19.665
Yup, there goes the Mercedes.
Oh, even the Maserati's sliding.

29:19.666 --> 29:22.826
And the Merc continues to
smoke like a refinery fire.

29:26.346 --> 29:29.385
A double helping
of agri-drivel there.

29:29.386 --> 29:32.745
OK, here we go,
the Maserati has the V8 engine.

29:32.746 --> 29:37.426
The Merc is now unleashing a 6.2
litre, 510 horsepower V8 atom bomb.

29:38.746 --> 29:43.225
Just a fantastic amount of power
in that thing. Two corners left.

29:43.226 --> 29:45.545
Looking pretty even so far.

29:45.546 --> 29:46.786
Penultimate corner.

29:46.787 --> 29:49.425
Didn't go sideways,
but Gambon, he did.

29:49.426 --> 29:51.826
And there we are, across the line.

29:54.866 --> 29:57.745
Now the Maserati... Yes.

29:57.746 --> 30:04.185
The Maserati did it in 1.23.1.
So it goes there. Not bad.

30:04.186 --> 30:06.665
Nearly as quick as a Ferrari 430
in fact.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.545
Come on, then. The Mercedes...

30:08.546 --> 30:11.865
1.21 dead. What?!

30:11.866 --> 30:17.225
Look at that.
It's between the 599 and an SLR.

30:17.226 --> 30:19.025
What?! Hang on. No, no. Hang on.

30:19.026 --> 30:23.025
How...? How did IT do that?

30:23.026 --> 30:26.265
Because as I've explained to you
many times, Hammond,

30:26.266 --> 30:29.585
precision and technicality
will always be beaten

30:29.586 --> 30:31.905
by shouting and smoking and power.

30:31.906 --> 30:36.225
Anyway, it's time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

30:36.226 --> 30:40.105
My guest tonight is quite simply
Doctor Who,

30:40.106 --> 30:44.065
which explains how he was able to
travel back in time to the 1980s

30:44.066 --> 30:48.386
and steal Phil Oakey's hair.
Ladies and gentlemen, Matt Smith!

30:51.546 --> 30:55.305
Hello, hello, hello!
How are you? Hello, big man.
It's good to see you.

30:55.306 --> 30:59.066
Thank you for having me on.
It's a pleasure!
Doctor Who is among us!

31:01.586 --> 31:04.226
He is!

31:06.066 --> 31:09.745
You're not wearing
your Doctor Who outfit!

31:09.746 --> 31:12.065
No, mate, just me civvies.

31:12.066 --> 31:14.705
And I've got odd socks on
cos I couldn't find them.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.186
You're actually dressed more like...

31:16.187 --> 31:19.745
Well, I've discovered you
are a football enthusiast.

31:19.746 --> 31:22.545
Oh, big! Yeah,
a massive football enthusiast.

31:22.546 --> 31:25.025
Did you ever play properly?

31:25.026 --> 31:27.225
I played for... I mean, yeah.

31:27.226 --> 31:32.225
I went through the youth academies
and I played for Forest
and I played for Leicester.

31:32.226 --> 31:34.745
Hooray!

31:34.746 --> 31:38.265
There's actually a Leicester City
supporter here?

31:38.266 --> 31:41.265
He's here! I should say it
that way round.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.665
You played and then what happened?

31:43.666 --> 31:46.265
I had a back injury
called spondylitis,

31:46.266 --> 31:51.865
or it's some sort of strange name.
Was it caused by your hair
going all on one side?

31:51.866 --> 31:55.665
Yeah, I was injured for a year,
and God bless my dad,

31:55.666 --> 32:00.945
he'd drive me up from school every
day when I was playing at Leicester
and I'd get the treatment there.

32:00.946 --> 32:04.345
But I just never recovered,
and so they let me go.

32:04.346 --> 32:07.345
Do you reckon you could've
been a footballist

32:07.346 --> 32:11.025
if your back hadn't have...? I hope
so. I was captain at the time,

32:11.026 --> 32:14.825
at Leicester under-15s, and, um...

32:14.826 --> 32:17.465
You know, I had a great season.
But who knows?

32:17.466 --> 32:19.865
The one player that I played with,

32:19.866 --> 32:22.785
and at Forest,
we were two years unbeaten.

32:22.786 --> 32:27.145
And the only player that went on
to play in the Premiership
was Jermaine Jenas, that was it.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.026
Yay. Howay.

32:30.826 --> 32:34.905
Let's move off football
and on to Doctor Who which is
I'm sure where everyone wants to go.

32:34.906 --> 32:39.385
It's the longest-running
sci-fi series in the world.
That's correct.

32:39.386 --> 32:45.305
Is it 50 years now or next...?
50 years, on, I think, it's November
23rd or 24th, 2013. 50 years.

32:45.306 --> 32:48.185
And you're the youngest Doctor ever.
I am the youngest carnation.

32:48.186 --> 32:52.185
I'm in the Guinness Book Of Records
which as child, I was like, "Yes!"

32:52.186 --> 32:53.985
The youngest Doctor Who.

32:53.986 --> 32:57.145
It's better than seeing how many
beans you can put up your nose!

32:57.146 --> 33:01.425
One of the things that fascinates
me is that when I was growing up,

33:01.426 --> 33:05.145
and Doctor Who had the Daleks on,
I was, "It's a thing with a sink
plunger!" I was terrified.

33:05.146 --> 33:10.825
But now, even my youngest plays
Call Of Duty and plays the Nazi
zombies with dogs that explode.

33:10.826 --> 33:12.825
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:12.826 --> 33:16.705
Is it difficult to think of
something that will scare a child

33:16.706 --> 33:21.145
who has just finished shooting an
alien in the face on a PlayStation?

33:21.146 --> 33:23.385
Well, no... Yes, perhaps, but...

33:23.386 --> 33:24.866
Doctor Who isn't scary in the way

33:24.867 --> 33:27.505
that there's blood and guts
and people getting blown up.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.265
And actually, how scary is that?

33:30.266 --> 33:33.905
"Scary" is in tension. That's why
I think the angels are really scary.

33:33.906 --> 33:37.425
Cos when you're not looking at them
they go, thumpthumpthump, like that.

33:37.426 --> 33:39.305
Yeah, that is quite scary.

33:39.306 --> 33:41.745
What's the grinning doll one called?

33:41.746 --> 33:43.265
Which one?

33:43.266 --> 33:45.665
It looks a bit like Richard Hammond.

33:45.666 --> 33:48.745
There were some dolls in this one,

33:48.746 --> 33:51.025
the peg dolls,
or there's the scarecrows,

33:51.026 --> 33:53.665
which was a Tennant episode.

33:53.666 --> 33:56.345
And then Cybermen aren't scary.

33:56.346 --> 33:59.905
Yes, but... They are not! Somebody
said they are, but they aren't.

33:59.906 --> 34:03.985
It's like, they're here, right,
and they come at you like this.

34:03.986 --> 34:05.186
They're slow, I know.

34:05.187 --> 34:08.465
You could just walk away.
"Oh, there's a Cyberman there,
I'll just stroll over here."

34:08.466 --> 34:12.344
Never apply logic to Who, because...
I suppose.

34:12.346 --> 34:16.745
Presumably a lot
goes with being Doctor Who
that's not just playing Doctor Who.

34:16.746 --> 34:21.025
Everywhere you go,
you've got to have children saying,
"Who's the scariest monster?"

34:21.025 --> 34:24.264
Yes! I don't know if I should even
say this, but I got home last night,

34:24.266 --> 34:28.185
got to my door, and there
was little girl of about 12 or 13

34:28.186 --> 34:29.945
reading a book in a bush.

34:29.946 --> 34:33.465
And she said, "Don't worry,
I'm not a homeless person."

34:33.466 --> 34:36.425
Then she said, "Could you just say,
'Hey, I'm the Doctor.'?"

34:36.426 --> 34:40.745
So I just sort of said,
"Hey! I'm the Doctor."

34:40.746 --> 34:44.264
Then went, "Go home!"

34:44.266 --> 34:48.585
That is quite scary. You could get
into trouble for that.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.905
Anyway, we had Michael Fassbender
on last week. I know, he did well.

34:51.906 --> 34:55.905
He did well and he's not
the only one that's appeared naked
in a film recently.

34:55.906 --> 35:00.745
You have too, in The Womb, you had
your Time-Lord sausage out.

35:00.746 --> 35:03.825
It was with Eva Green,
who played a Bond girl.

35:03.826 --> 35:06.425
A very beautiful woman.
She was, in Casino Royale.

35:06.426 --> 35:08.505
The first scene of the first day,

35:08.506 --> 35:12.745
we're on the most northerly point
of Germany and it's Baltic cold.

35:12.746 --> 35:15.745
It's March.
And I've got to get in the sea.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.825
So I get there, I go in the sea,

35:17.826 --> 35:20.305
freeze my BLEEP off, come out,

35:20.306 --> 35:22.785
and then do this scene
with Eva Green!

35:22.786 --> 35:27.866
And what can you do but apologise
and go, "It's normally
much more majestic!"

35:29.426 --> 35:32.545
It was awful! This beautiful
French woman and you're like...

35:32.546 --> 35:35.225
I saw... I saw in the film,

35:35.226 --> 35:39.266
you see her eyes, I come
and she goes... You what?

35:40.946 --> 35:44.306
I come out of the water. I see,
I'm with you, and she's like...

35:45.946 --> 35:48.905
Yeah, it was crap, basically.

35:48.906 --> 35:50.945
Now, cars.

35:50.946 --> 35:55.825
As you're such a young Doctor Who,
I can't imagine your car history's
particularly brilliant.

35:55.826 --> 36:02.545
Well, no. The first car I had was...
I passed at 18 and I got a Corsa
which I bought brand new.

36:02.546 --> 36:06.465
And I've got to say,
it was a brilliant little motor,

36:06.466 --> 36:10.545
and it's still going.
It's still going. So, this was
a ten-year-old Vauxhall Corsa?

36:10.546 --> 36:14.865
Yeah, my sister's driving it about
and I broke the wing mirror,

36:14.866 --> 36:19.745
so I just taped it with gaffer tape
and had it like that for four years.
My friends would call it "The Shed".

36:19.746 --> 36:25.825
Was it much bigger on the inside
than on the outside? Sadly not.
What do you dream of owning?

36:25.826 --> 36:29.465
Do you know what I'd like most of
all? I'd like an old 911. I know
it's a point of contention...

36:29.466 --> 36:33.625
You may as well have an old one
cos the new one is exactly the same.

36:33.626 --> 36:36.385
They're sexy cars.

36:36.386 --> 36:39.185
Especially the old 911,
from what was it?

36:39.186 --> 36:45.025
In the '90s. They're the same as
they are now! And it's not new.

36:45.026 --> 36:49.145
Obviously, of course, you came here
to do your lap. Yeah.

36:49.146 --> 36:53.425
How did it go?
I was getting frustrated.
I spun off a couple of times.

36:53.426 --> 36:58.225
But I just thought,
"Right, hell for leather!"
But I think that was my problem.

36:58.226 --> 37:02.345
A lot of the guests
that come here struggle
with the second-to-last corner.

37:02.346 --> 37:06.465
And we've got some footage of you
attempting to get around there.
Oh, God... Anyone like to see?

37:06.466 --> 37:08.985
Yes!

37:08.986 --> 37:11.585
Let's have a look at Matt coming up
to the second-to-last corner.

37:11.586 --> 37:12.905
And...

37:12.906 --> 37:14.825
run a bit wide there.

37:14.826 --> 37:17.625
Now that was attempt number one,
there.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.625
And then that's Gambon
with a new line.

37:20.626 --> 37:23.825
There we are, not crossing the line.
Here we are again.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.025
Oh, you, BLEEP!

37:26.026 --> 37:29.225
See, that's quite angry.
Oh, dear, now...

37:29.226 --> 37:31.186
Fishtanking.

37:33.066 --> 37:34.825
I really admire...

37:34.826 --> 37:37.586
I do admire a man who goes,
"No, I can do it!"

37:39.066 --> 37:42.265
Who here
would like to see Matt's lap?

37:42.266 --> 37:43.905
Yes!

37:43.906 --> 37:45.666
Play the tape. Oh, no...

37:47.186 --> 37:51.345
Now, let's see if we can see any
evidence of this aggressive driving.

37:51.346 --> 37:53.306
Right, concentrate. Calm.

37:54.386 --> 37:56.665
♪ We're singing in the rain... ♪

37:56.666 --> 38:00.105
That's not a bad idea, actually.
♪ Just singing in the rain... ♪

38:00.106 --> 38:01.826
I was getting too annoyed, you see.

38:03.266 --> 38:05.706
Couple of bites at turning in there.
Wide, wide, wide...

38:05.707 --> 38:09.785
That's a tortured tyre,
but it is clinging on well.

38:09.786 --> 38:11.746
I'm just sort of braking around it.

38:14.866 --> 38:17.345
♪ And down to second gear... ♪

38:17.346 --> 38:20.665
Ooh, running a bit wide there.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.305
Listen to those tyres! They're
working for a living today.

38:24.306 --> 38:26.225
This is the Hammerhead coming up.

38:26.226 --> 38:30.666
It's like an angry shark.
Oh, yeah...

38:32.906 --> 38:35.745
That's actually quite nicely done.

38:35.746 --> 38:39.745
In, a lot of understeer
at the first part and... Argh!

38:39.746 --> 38:41.666
OK on the way out.

38:44.546 --> 38:48.785
And we're going to hit Gambon
like a BLEEP train.

38:48.786 --> 38:50.185
'Come on!'

38:50.186 --> 38:53.185
Like to see a man planning ahead -
we're only at the Follow-through,

38:53.186 --> 38:56.946
still got that to do.
And the tyres... Long way.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.546
Good cutting.

39:02.866 --> 39:06.905
Yeah, yeah... Into second.
You're in very soon.

39:06.906 --> 39:09.865
You can leave it in third
actually for Gambon.

39:09.866 --> 39:13.186
And lots of understeer again,
but across the line!

39:20.466 --> 39:25.505
Now, you are by no means the first
Doctor Who we've had down here.

39:25.506 --> 39:27.145
You've had Chris and David.

39:27.146 --> 39:30.145
Yeah, we've had Christopher
Eccleston and David Tennant.

39:30.146 --> 39:31.785
We've even had Billie Piper.

39:31.786 --> 39:36.825
Former assistant. Yeah, I've driven
with Billie. She's quick.

39:36.826 --> 39:40.185
She did it in the Lacetti in one...
I haven't got my glasses on.

39:40.186 --> 39:44.785
It was either a 1:46 or a 1:48.
Has anyone got any glasses?

39:44.786 --> 39:50.785
She did it in 1:48.3.
Actually, she was the quickest.
1:48.3, what were the others?

39:50.786 --> 39:53.705
Eccleston was 1:52.4, in the Liana,

39:53.706 --> 39:57.105
and Dave was 1:48.8.

39:57.106 --> 40:00.505
1:48.8... So where
do you think YOU'VE come?

40:00.506 --> 40:03.825
Actually, you're in a new car.
Cos they did it in the Liana
or the Lacetti.

40:03.826 --> 40:06.625
So where do think you've come?
I have no idea.

40:06.626 --> 40:08.865
I know I'm nowhere near Fassbender.

40:08.866 --> 40:11.906
Oh, I don't really want to be
below Louis Walsh.

40:13.826 --> 40:20.065
Where is Louis Walsh? At 1:47.7,
that wasn't that rapid.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.225
You did it... Hm...

40:22.226 --> 40:23.785
1...

40:23.786 --> 40:26.665
40...

40:26.666 --> 40:28.146
So that's good.

40:30.546 --> 40:31.985
3...

40:31.986 --> 40:34.545
Point 7. Get in!

40:34.546 --> 40:36.665
Matt Smith, the fastest Doctor Who!

40:36.666 --> 40:40.145
And you go right up there.
I'll take that.

40:40.146 --> 40:45.025
I'll take that, absolutely!
That's a bloody good time.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.825
Yeah! Get in!

40:46.826 --> 40:49.945
That was a good time. Up there with
Ryan Reynolds, exactly the same.

40:49.946 --> 40:52.625
And it's weird, because normally,

40:52.626 --> 40:56.345
when a lap looks boring and slow
and steady, they're the quick ones.

40:56.346 --> 40:58.185
Yours looked properly aggressive.

40:58.186 --> 41:02.025
So, do you drive the TARDIS
like that? Is it the full,
"Give it some!"

41:02.026 --> 41:04.545
Absolutely, that's the only way
to drive the TARDIS.

41:04.546 --> 41:09.225
That's why it's always broken.
You're always having to hit it
with your screwdriver!

41:09.226 --> 41:13.145
It's been a huge pleasure to have
you on, the fastest Doctor Who we've
ever had. I'm chuffed with that.

41:13.146 --> 41:15.546
Ladies and gentlemen, Matt Smith!

41:28.266 --> 41:32.265
When we heard the news that Saab
had closed down,

41:32.266 --> 41:35.785
Jeremy and I were genuinely
very sad.

41:35.786 --> 41:40.226
Although we weren't actually sure
why, so we went to investigate.

41:42.106 --> 41:45.385
Saab began as an aeroplane maker.

41:45.386 --> 41:51.625
But after WWII, it noticed
that demand for fighter planes
had dropped off dramatically.

41:51.626 --> 41:55.345
So it decided
to start making cars as well.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.505
The first effort
was created by two men...

41:58.506 --> 42:01.985
one who designed wings
and one who designed bomb racks.

42:01.986 --> 42:05.226
Neither had done a car before
and it kind of showed.

42:07.546 --> 42:13.385
Their prototype had enclosed front
wheels which was very aerodynamic,

42:13.386 --> 42:16.745
but as you drove along in winter,
snow would build up in the arches

42:16.746 --> 42:21.385
and it was only when you got
to a corner when you noticed
the steering had jammed.

42:21.386 --> 42:24.785
There were other issues too -
the rear window was tiny

42:24.786 --> 42:27.146
and there was no boot lid.

42:31.146 --> 42:34.905
Mass production
wasn't their bag either.

42:34.906 --> 42:39.225
While Austin made a car every 27
seconds, it took Saab 27 minutes.

42:39.226 --> 42:43.426
Oh, and all their cars
were painted green.

42:46.466 --> 42:49.185
So, a green car
with no boot you could use,

42:49.186 --> 42:51.145
and in bad weather, no steering.

42:51.146 --> 42:55.905
But the biggest problem in those
early days was the engine.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.226
As James shall now explain.

43:00.386 --> 43:04.665
This is the 92.
It was Saab's first production car,

43:04.666 --> 43:07.065
and it came with a thirsty
two-stroke engine

43:07.066 --> 43:09.826
that produced just 25 horsepower.

43:11.066 --> 43:16.865
The real problem is that the engine
was only lubricated when you had
your foot on the throttle.

43:16.866 --> 43:20.345
In a two-stroke,
engine oil is mixed with the fuel,

43:20.346 --> 43:23.625
so if there's no fuel going in,
there's no oil going in.

43:23.626 --> 43:27.265
This wasn't an issue when you were
driving along on a level like this,

43:27.266 --> 43:31.426
or going up a hill, because you
had your foot on the throttle and
you had the fuel and oil going in.

43:33.586 --> 43:38.065
But once you were going downhill,
you had a problem as you had to
brake with your left foot, but...

43:38.066 --> 43:41.225
Whoa! Keep the power on
with your right foot

43:41.226 --> 43:43.825
so that the engine
still got some oil.

43:43.826 --> 43:46.505
Whoa... This is very tricky.

43:46.506 --> 43:51.345
And it feels stupid. I'm driving
and stopping at the same time.

43:51.346 --> 43:56.585
Then you'll arrive at the bottom
of the hill with your brakes
completely boiled over

43:56.586 --> 44:01.105
and your 65mph Saab would be
absolutely unable to stop.

44:01.106 --> 44:02.625
It's hopeless.

44:02.626 --> 44:06.426
'Saab's history is littered
with terrible mistakes like this.'

44:08.866 --> 44:10.745
'There was the 900 convertible,

44:10.746 --> 44:13.665
'which was as rigid
as a week-old salad.

44:13.666 --> 44:15.665
'There was the Sonnet,

44:15.666 --> 44:18.986
'which was supposed to have been
a sports car... but wasn't.'

44:20.506 --> 44:24.546
'And then in then in 1992, they even
made a car with no steering wheel.'

44:35.506 --> 44:37.786
In fact, the more you drive this...

44:39.026 --> 44:40.785
the easier it becomes.

44:40.786 --> 44:43.625
The temptation is to just
stare at the bonnet in wonderment

44:43.626 --> 44:46.866
that you can actually have
any directional control at all.

44:48.146 --> 44:54.586
So, lots of Swedish strangeness,
and an advertising campaign that
didn't make much sense either.

45:00.506 --> 45:03.825
'Only one aircraft manufacturer
makes cars.

45:03.826 --> 45:07.266
'Sierra-Alpha-Alpha-Bravo.'

45:08.226 --> 45:10.905
Yes, Saab loved to remind us

45:10.906 --> 45:14.745
that their cars came from a company
that made jet fighters.

45:14.746 --> 45:15.906
But it was nonsense.

45:15.907 --> 45:20.145
This jet fighter, for example,
had an engine made by Volvo.

45:20.146 --> 45:24.545
'Saab. It's a pity other cars
aren't built this way.'

45:24.546 --> 45:29.385
The idea was that you were buying
"a jet fighter for the road",

45:29.386 --> 45:31.785
but were you?

45:31.786 --> 45:34.505
So, James,
you have a pilot's licence

45:34.506 --> 45:38.985
and I believe you've been in
a Typhoon, a fighter aircraft. Yes.

45:38.986 --> 45:42.586
Is there anything in here
that puts you in mind of that plane?

45:44.466 --> 45:46.665
No. What, nothing?

45:46.666 --> 45:48.225
No.

45:48.226 --> 45:52.185
Is the key down here on a Typhoon?

45:52.186 --> 45:53.665
No.

45:53.666 --> 45:57.905
Do you have to lock the Typhoon in
reverse before you take the key out?

45:57.906 --> 46:02.665
No, it doesn't have reverse,
as such. It has reverse thrust.

46:02.666 --> 46:06.865
Yeah, but it doesn't have
a reverse gear. It doesn't
have a key, actually.

46:06.866 --> 46:10.105
So, this is really not the same.

46:10.106 --> 46:14.025
However,
it does have a night panel button.

46:14.026 --> 46:17.585
It shuts down all the dials
apart from the speedo.

46:17.586 --> 46:21.105
Now, I can see this would be useful
if you were in

46:21.106 --> 46:23.185
an F-14 over the Pacific

46:23.186 --> 46:26.265
looking for the landing lights
on your aircraft carrier.

46:26.266 --> 46:31.825
But on the A38 outside Derby,
why would you want that?

46:31.826 --> 46:37.305
I used to worry it was all
just broken anyway. How do you know?

46:37.306 --> 46:39.745
I went in an F-15 once,

46:39.746 --> 46:44.665
it was very different because
nothing in here is covered in sick.

46:44.666 --> 46:50.025
Even after Saab was taken over
by General Motors in the late '80s,

46:50.026 --> 46:52.625
their marketing men kept at it.

46:52.626 --> 46:54.905
Breathtaking acceleration.

46:54.906 --> 46:59.385
Here, an F-22 Raptor, not built
by Saab, being used to advertise

46:59.386 --> 47:02.785
what is basically
a Vauxhall Cavalier.

47:02.786 --> 47:05.346
Saab, pure driving pleasure.

47:06.786 --> 47:10.665
So, Saab, a chequered history,
bonkers advertising

47:10.666 --> 47:12.505
and lots of harebrained ideas.

47:12.506 --> 47:15.505
But for every idea
they had that didn't work,

47:15.506 --> 47:18.265
they had another which did.

47:18.266 --> 47:21.145
Often brilliantly.

47:21.146 --> 47:25.306
And one of the most brilliant ideas
of them all was this.

47:27.426 --> 47:30.346
The 99 Turbo.

47:31.826 --> 47:34.225
Saab weren't the first
to turbocharge a car,

47:34.226 --> 47:38.665
that was Chevrolet
and BMW and Porsche.

47:38.666 --> 47:43.825
But they were the first to
put a turbocharger on
a mainstream car, which was this.

47:43.826 --> 47:47.825
It was thanks to this car
that everything in the '80s

47:47.826 --> 47:49.705
went turbo-crazy.

47:49.706 --> 47:52.945
The word "turbo" came to mean
anything that was really good.
It did.

47:52.946 --> 47:56.385
I had a turbo vacuum cleaner,
which was fair enough,

47:56.386 --> 47:59.545
but my mate had turbo sunglasses!

47:59.546 --> 48:02.185
It said it on the lens.

48:02.186 --> 48:06.945
You also got turbo razors.
Turbo aftershave.

48:06.946 --> 48:09.705
Did you? Well, I didn't
because I don't wear aftershave

48:09.706 --> 48:12.185
because I'm not from Cheshire!

48:12.186 --> 48:16.425
There was more, because
you could even buy your Turbo

48:16.426 --> 48:19.105
'with water injection.'
I don't understand that.

48:19.106 --> 48:21.905
I could explain it
but you're not interested.

48:21.906 --> 48:24.625
No, I am. You're not!
I am interested.

48:24.626 --> 48:28.865
Water injection in the inlet
cools the charger

48:28.866 --> 48:32.986
and it's the job later done by...
I'm not interested!

48:34.026 --> 48:37.865
All we need to know is that
with water injection this

48:37.866 --> 48:42.745
turbo-charged pocket rocket could
get from 0 to 60 in eight seconds.

48:42.746 --> 48:47.345
That's quick,
even by today's standards.

48:47.346 --> 48:50.625
It accelerates faster than
a modern Mini Cooper. Yeah.

48:50.626 --> 48:54.666
And a Renaultsport Twingo 133.
This is a fast car.

48:57.706 --> 49:00.146
It is quick.

49:01.466 --> 49:04.625
Now, there is some
Saab weirdness.

49:04.626 --> 49:07.745
The steering wheel comes out of
the dashboard at an angle.

49:07.746 --> 49:13.065
It's like that. And there's a button
here that says extra. Extra what?

49:13.066 --> 49:18.666
It doesn't say. It just says extra.
Try it. Ready? Yes.

49:20.946 --> 49:25.745
You haven't got any more
interesting or attractive!

49:25.746 --> 49:29.585
Little details aside,
this is a fantastic car.

49:29.586 --> 49:34.585
This is a truly fantastic car.
It's a legendary car.

49:34.586 --> 49:37.146
I used to covet this massively.

49:39.266 --> 49:42.025
It wasn't just the speed I liked,
either.

49:42.026 --> 49:44.145
Because when you look at the bumpers

49:44.146 --> 49:46.985
sticking out like a spoiled child's
bottom lip,

49:46.986 --> 49:49.545
you get a sense
the Scandinavian engineers

49:49.546 --> 49:53.146
cared about the safety
of you and your family.

49:55.066 --> 49:58.465
I had my first proper road accident
in one of these.

49:58.466 --> 50:00.945
I was a passenger here on this side.

50:00.946 --> 50:05.465
I was only 17 and it belonged
to my girlfriend's dad.

50:05.466 --> 50:10.225
It was quite a rare car and it was
lovely, white with a blue stripe.

50:10.226 --> 50:13.225
The interior
was this brick-red dusty colour.

50:13.226 --> 50:16.105
And it was a really nice car.
We went around a roundabout

50:16.106 --> 50:19.665
and a car coming up the road
didn't stop and T-boned us here.

50:19.666 --> 50:23.906
I was perfectly OK. You would be
in a Saab. What was the girl called?

50:26.226 --> 50:28.785
Uh...

50:28.786 --> 50:30.665
Kate? No...

50:30.666 --> 50:35.105
You can remember the Saab had brick
red upholstery and had a blue stripe

50:35.106 --> 50:38.065
and where you were sitting
but not the name of the girlfriend.

50:38.066 --> 50:39.506
Was she called Derek?!

50:41.906 --> 50:45.985
Because this car was fast and safe
and a bit left-field,

50:45.986 --> 50:49.145
it brought the Saab brand
to the attention of

50:49.146 --> 50:51.305
a very specific type of customer.

50:51.306 --> 50:54.865
A customer who has remained loyal
ever since.

50:54.866 --> 50:56.785
This person likes Audis.

50:56.786 --> 50:58.745
This one likes Ferraris.

50:58.746 --> 51:00.505
This one likes the bus.

51:00.506 --> 51:02.145
This one has a Honda.

51:02.146 --> 51:03.266
He has a Peugeot.

51:03.267 --> 51:06.065
And then this chap
with the black polo neck

51:06.066 --> 51:08.065
and the thin specs.

51:08.066 --> 51:12.105
He is an architect,
and he likes Saabs.

51:12.106 --> 51:18.225
♪ All the leaves are brown... ♪

51:18.226 --> 51:23.266
Research has shown that Saab drivers
are the best educated people
on the roads.

51:26.066 --> 51:31.745
The 99 gave Saab customers other
companies could only dream about.

51:31.746 --> 51:36.425
This car, then, was Saab's
Dark Side Of The Moon.

51:36.426 --> 51:41.066
Their first big hit,
the one we all remember.

51:42.786 --> 51:48.665
None of the models that followed
the 99 Turbo appeared to have quite
the same appeal.

51:48.666 --> 51:50.985
But they did.

51:50.986 --> 51:54.345
'What we have here is a 1980s BMW

51:54.346 --> 51:57.905
'hanging upside down
eight feet from the ground.

51:57.906 --> 52:01.866
'And what we are going to do
is drop it.'

52:04.946 --> 52:07.945
You wouldn't want to be in that
if it fell from a crane upside down.

52:07.946 --> 52:12.225
If you were Richard Hammond,
you'd be all right.

52:12.226 --> 52:15.946
Yeah, that's toast. The steering
wheel is touching the ceiling.

52:17.546 --> 52:19.745
'So, let's see what happens

52:19.746 --> 52:23.666
'when we drop a 1980s Saab 900
from the same height.'

52:29.026 --> 52:31.505
God, I really wouldn't
have believed that.

52:31.506 --> 52:35.425
I would not have believed that
in a million years. Look at that.

52:35.426 --> 52:39.825
I think you could get out as well.
That is stunning.

52:39.826 --> 52:44.345
Saab made the pillars so strong
that when they went rallying

52:44.346 --> 52:46.826
they didn't have to fit a roll cage.
Is that true? Yeah.

52:46.827 --> 52:51.825
They had to fit one because of
regulations but it wasn't necessary.

52:51.826 --> 52:53.665
I was talking the other day

52:53.666 --> 52:56.985
to a friend who is
a senior designer with
another Swedish car company

52:56.986 --> 53:04.306
and he said nobody
could ever work out why Saab cost
so much until they crashed it.

53:05.666 --> 53:08.705
Saab were always pathological
about safety.

53:08.706 --> 53:14.066
Before putting a car on sale
they made sure it could survive
just about anything.

53:15.106 --> 53:17.506
Even a head-on collision
with a moose.

53:21.906 --> 53:24.265
This attention to detail
caused a few problems

53:24.266 --> 53:26.905
when they conceived the 9000.

53:26.906 --> 53:30.585
Because, to save costs,
it was designed in tandem

53:30.586 --> 53:32.506
with the Lancia Thema.

53:34.226 --> 53:37.825
The idea was that
behind the different badges

53:37.826 --> 53:43.225
and underneath the bodies, the cars
would actually be the same.

53:43.226 --> 53:48.185
And it seemed like they were -
up until the point
that they were crash-tested.

53:48.186 --> 53:52.185
Lancia's engineers
described the results as perfect.

53:52.186 --> 53:57.505
Saab's engineers described them
as - I'm quoting directly here -
"not good at all."

53:57.506 --> 54:01.666
And from that moment on, the
joint venture completely fell apart.

54:03.666 --> 54:07.105
The Saab ended up with much bigger
wheels than the Lancia.

54:07.106 --> 54:09.026
It was also made out of
thicker steel

54:09.027 --> 54:12.345
and had a completely
different rear axle.

54:12.346 --> 54:16.225
Sticking to principles like that
is expensive.

54:16.226 --> 54:21.226
Saab was losing money hand over fist
on every car it made.

54:23.306 --> 54:26.706
Even advertising it as a jet fighter
for the road didn't help.

54:28.906 --> 54:31.785
Saab 9000.

54:31.786 --> 54:37.185
So, in 1989, Saab was bailed out
by General Motors.

54:37.186 --> 54:40.265
To try and larch some fiscal sense
into them,

54:40.266 --> 54:43.985
a team executives from GM
went over to Sweden and said,

54:43.986 --> 54:47.665
"This is a Cavalier
from our Vauxhall division."

54:47.666 --> 54:53.145
"To make your new car, you change
the body and the badges. That's it."

54:53.146 --> 54:56.305
Nice and cheap. Body and badges.

54:56.306 --> 55:00.465
Saab ignored them so completely
that their new 900

55:00.466 --> 55:05.265
shared only a third of its
components with the Cavalier.

55:05.266 --> 55:08.985
When the time came to replace
the 900 with the 93,

55:08.986 --> 55:13.705
the General Motors executives
went to Sweden again and said,

55:13.706 --> 55:18.425
"Here is the Vauxhall Vectra.
This time we mean it.

55:18.426 --> 55:23.745
"Only change the body
and the badges. Nothing else."

55:23.746 --> 55:27.625
Guess what?
The Swedes went even more mental.

55:27.626 --> 55:32.265
They changed so much that even
the wheelbase was different.

55:32.266 --> 55:35.865
At one point, a General Motors
accountant went to Sweden

55:35.866 --> 55:39.105
to see why Saab was costing them
so much money.

55:39.106 --> 55:42.425
He got into the new 93,
turned on the Sat Nav

55:42.426 --> 55:45.945
and thought, "Wait a minute,
that's not one of our systems."

55:45.946 --> 55:47.505
He was right, it wasn't.

55:47.506 --> 55:51.505
Saab had developed,
at vast expense, their own system

55:51.506 --> 55:55.666
because they thought GM's
wasn't good enough.

55:57.146 --> 56:00.825
Eventually, General Motors
had had enough.

56:00.826 --> 56:03.145
In 2010,
as Saab was finishing the job

56:03.146 --> 56:07.785
of turning the Vauxhall Insignia
into the completely different 95,

56:07.786 --> 56:10.986
the Detroit giants pulled the plug.

56:11.946 --> 56:15.825
The brand itself will have
some residual value,

56:15.826 --> 56:18.626
the company's facilities are likely
to be broken up and sold.

56:19.946 --> 56:22.185
At the last minute,
a buyer was found,

56:22.186 --> 56:26.305
a Dutchman who owned a small car
company called Spyker.

56:26.306 --> 56:28.865
To get the money rolling in,

56:28.866 --> 56:33.506
he needed to get the new 95 into the
showrooms as quickly as possible.

56:34.866 --> 56:38.065
That meant it went on sale
before it was finished.

56:38.066 --> 56:41.105
And that meant it was
a commercial flop.

56:41.106 --> 56:46.706
And so in January of this year,
Saab closed down for good.

56:53.066 --> 56:58.546
So, this is the last ever Saab
that we are in right now. Yeah.

57:00.666 --> 57:07.626
This is the final chapter. I really
like the way they did things.

57:11.186 --> 57:17.786
I am going to miss Saab.
It is a sad day. It is sad.

57:21.266 --> 57:24.585
It is a sad day, too,
for the Swedish town of Trollhattan

57:24.586 --> 57:30.185
where for 60 years the workforce has
tried to be different, to be better.

57:30.186 --> 57:31.906
To think outside the box.

57:35.786 --> 57:40.465
And, of course, it's very sad
for our architect friend who,

57:40.466 --> 57:44.065
from now on,
will have to buy a five series.

57:44.066 --> 57:47.585
Still, there's one crumb of comfort
because let's not forget

57:47.586 --> 57:51.425
whose engines powered
the first-ever jet fighter.

57:51.426 --> 57:53.986
BMW.

58:01.586 --> 58:03.906
Genuinely sad.

58:08.546 --> 58:11.745
You ought to know that
the Messerschmitt 262

58:11.746 --> 58:14.345
was supposed to use BMW engines
but it didn't work.

58:14.346 --> 58:16.546
It had Junker's engines
when it went into action.

58:16.547 --> 58:20.545
James, we haven't got time
for your precise history of aviation
since 1944!

58:20.546 --> 58:24.825
What I'm interested in, those
architects who've got Saabs today,

58:24.826 --> 58:28.625
if the company has gone,
will they be able to
keep their cars on the road?

58:28.626 --> 58:30.985
Well, you might imagine

58:30.986 --> 58:33.905
if you had a Saab you could take it
to a Vauxhall dealer

58:33.906 --> 58:37.865
but because Saab changed so much,
you may as well take it to WHSmith.

58:37.866 --> 58:41.825
They would be more likely to be
able to service it. The good news is

58:41.826 --> 58:44.585
a new company has started up
specifically to

58:44.586 --> 58:47.185
provide parts for Saabs.

58:47.186 --> 58:51.025
If you are an architect, fingers
crossed, you should be OK for a bit.

58:51.026 --> 58:56.905
That's the second week on the trot
we have ended with a useful piece
of consumer advice!

58:56.906 --> 58:59.905
It's weird. And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

58:59.906 --> 59:03.266
Thank you so much for watching.
Good night!
