WEBVTT

00:09.160 --> 00:12.000
A dramatic turn of events
at the trial in Caltanissetta

00:12.080 --> 00:15.440
concerning possible mismanagement
of seized Mafia assets.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.480
Silvana Saguto, the former judge
accused of corruption,

00:18.560 --> 00:22.200
has revealed a diary containing a list
of people she granted favor.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.000
I don't know who she's blackmailing
with this book of hers,

00:27.080 --> 00:29.000
that's what it is, blackmail.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.440
I think she's in a position to blackmail

00:32.520 --> 00:34.640
half of the Italian judiciary.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.240
The notion that I meant
to threaten anyone with this diary

00:41.320 --> 00:42.280
is absurd.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.760
In reality,
the names were all business cards

00:46.840 --> 00:49.000
given to me by my colleagues,

00:49.080 --> 00:50.480
of people they trusted.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.240
Saguto thought
I was a piece of shit.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.080
She said that I was paid or supported…

01:03.360 --> 01:05.800
by the Mafia to destroy her.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.000
She's telling lies.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.640
They told us
to tread carefully with Maniaci

01:12.720 --> 01:14.080
JULY 2015

01:14.160 --> 01:16.080
because we don't want him
to become a victim.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.800
She needs to explain
the meaning behind all these calls

01:21.880 --> 01:23.280
we managed to wiretap.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.360
If those prosecutor's office fuckwits

01:26.440 --> 01:29.160
had investigated Maniaci,
they would have already arrested him.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.120
In those recordings,
Saguto shows how much she loves me.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.680
To avoid making him a victim,
they need to be ready with… to get out.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.800
Or better, how much she wants me dead.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.440
Don't worry.
I'm told his days are numbered.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.360
Who?

01:46.480 --> 01:48.240
Him. Big moustache.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.480
Do you see how serious this is?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.080
She should be ashamed!

01:58.440 --> 01:59.880
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

02:28.920 --> 02:31.160
JULY 2015

02:32.560 --> 02:35.040
I can see how he's friends
with everyone,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.120
especially those kinds of people,
because as soon

02:37.200 --> 02:40.360
as we shut down a business,
Telejato in Partinico gets involved.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.960
He supports all the mafiosos,
to a certain extent.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.840
BUSINESS OWNER PIETRO CAVALLOTTI
WAS ABLE TO GET THE WIRETAPS

02:46.920 --> 02:48.960
USED IN SAGUTO'S TRIAL

02:49.920 --> 02:53.440
I told you they confirmed
the conviction for the Impastatos.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.000
We're waiting
for the Cavallottis.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.160
We knew that she
was persecuting us, and this proves it.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.560
She was certain
she had to confiscate our business.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.680
However, as I listened to the recordings,

03:07.760 --> 03:11.440
I realized there were quite a few
that mentioned Pino Maniaci.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.880
It was discussed almost daily.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.920
He was called "ignorant,"
"an asshole," "a crook."

03:23.280 --> 03:27.200
There are some shocking things in there.
In some conversations,

03:27.280 --> 03:31.200
it almost appears that they were planning
to get rid of Pino Maniaci

03:31.280 --> 03:32.600
through the courts,

03:32.680 --> 03:35.520
and then Saguto asks,
"When will this news arrive?"

03:36.640 --> 03:39.320
She's probably referring
to an investigation and trial

03:39.400 --> 03:40.480
of Pino Maniaci.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.320
I'm going to Caltanissetta

03:45.400 --> 03:48.760
to see former Judge Saguto take the stand.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.880
At the very least,
I expect that seeing me will ruin her day.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.400
If she goes red in the face,

04:01.040 --> 04:02.240
my job will be done.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.880
We need to give
Pino Maniaci credit.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.720
I've said it plenty of times.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.680
If Pino Maniaci hadn't gotten involved,

04:15.760 --> 04:18.800
if he hadn't told the truth
about what was going on,

04:19.320 --> 04:22.040
what everyone knew,
but no one wanted to talk about,

04:22.560 --> 04:24.720
Saguto would still be seated.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.640
So we should build
a statue of Pino Maniaci.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.320
SAGUTO TRIAL

04:42.400 --> 04:46.360
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF SILVANA SAGUTO

04:49.760 --> 04:52.280
I need her to see me.
I need to annoy her.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.160
When she saw Pino Maniaci, she looked like
she knew she was in for it.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.120
Little Pino Maniaci
who brought down the queen of Palermo

05:08.200 --> 05:10.320
and the whole preventive measures system.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.560
I went to Caltanissetta
to Silvana Saguto's trial

05:16.640 --> 05:20.400
because on the first day,
she had put on a show about Pino Maniaci.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.760
And so, of course, I wanted to be there

05:22.840 --> 05:26.360
to… to see if she would
put on a show for me.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.080
Go ahead.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.520
But they spoke about the €20,000

05:33.600 --> 05:36.440
that Cappellano Seminara
took to Saguto's house.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.880
The second hearing
of the Saguto trial in Caltanissetta

05:39.960 --> 05:42.760
will focus on the cross-examination
of the former president

05:42.840 --> 05:45.920
of the Preventive Measures Department
at the Court of Palermo.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.160
The mystery of the documents
will be at the center

05:48.240 --> 05:50.000
of the prosecutor's questioning.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.720
The most serious act
of alleged corruption

05:54.800 --> 05:58.040
is the €20,000 that the lawyer Cappellano,

05:58.560 --> 06:00.400
according to the prosecution,

06:00.480 --> 06:04.120
gave to Saguto on June 30th in a suitcase.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.680
SILVANA SAGUTO'S LAWYER

06:06.760 --> 06:10.720
Twenty thousand euros, twenty!
That fits in a small packet.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.560
The suitcase and the visit
at 10:30 at night

06:15.640 --> 06:19.360
makes more sense
as the delivery of a document to Saguto.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.040
Good morning, ma'am.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.040
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

06:26.120 --> 06:29.640
In that series of days,
at the end of June in 2015,

06:29.720 --> 06:33.520
do you remember if you or your family
had any financial deadlines?

06:34.800 --> 06:38.320
We had some financial trouble,
but we weren't destitute.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.560
We were never delinquent,
we weren't penniless.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.520
WIRETAPPED CONVERSATION

06:46.600 --> 06:49.200
BETWEEN SILVANA SAGUTO
AND CAPPELLANO SEMINARA

06:51.440 --> 06:54.760
You don't understand.
I'm desperate. I have no money left.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.760
I'll look into it.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.760
If I don't pay
the American Express by the 30th,

07:00.840 --> 07:04.320
I'll lose everything.
We're ruined. I'll have to sell the house.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.520
All right, on the 30th of June,
your husband contacted you

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
to tell you

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
that Banca Nuova had called him.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.440
We had an €8,000 loan with Banca Nuova.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.120
About 40 seconds later,
you make another phone call.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.120
You call Cappellano Seminara.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.800
WIRETAPPED PHONE CALL

07:26.880 --> 07:29.160
BETWEEN SILVANA SAGUTO
AND CAPPELLANO SEMINARA

07:30.720 --> 07:33.360
Listen, when can I see you?
Can you come to the house?

07:34.480 --> 07:37.520
-If you let me.
-Yes, that's better.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.040
I ha… I have the document.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.320
-Okay, I'm here.
-I'd rather not talk about it.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.440
Perfect.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.120
Why was it one minute after
your husband called

07:49.200 --> 07:51.240
to tell you about Banca Nuova,

07:51.320 --> 07:54.120
that the first thing that you did
was call Cappellano?

07:54.880 --> 07:57.320
Because I couldn't care less
about Banca Nuova.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.880
It was inconvenient
that I had a problem with the bank, yes,

08:01.960 --> 08:04.920
but it wasn't serious.
So I focused on what I needed to do,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.080
which was get hold of Cappellano
for those damned documents he had for me.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.920
I'd also like to know,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.040
when you say "documents,"
what exactly are you referring to?

08:19.480 --> 08:23.680
When I say "money," I mean money.
When I say "documents," I mean documents.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.680
Proof is proof. It's unambiguous.
If there's money, show me the money.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.680
You can't say,

08:32.760 --> 08:35.400
"Here it says 'documents,'
that could mean 'money.'"

08:37.880 --> 08:40.840
Even if we'd say "money,"
it would make no sense.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.520
It makes no sense.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.600
That said, ma'am,
can you explain to me why

08:49.480 --> 08:51.880
the following day, on the 30th of June,

08:52.480 --> 08:54.720
there were four cash deposits,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.400
three at Banca Nuova and one at UniCredit?

08:57.480 --> 09:02.160
The ones at Banca Nuova
were for 3,000, 2,000,

09:02.240 --> 09:03.640
and another 3,000

09:04.400 --> 09:06.880
occurring from July 1st to July 7th?

09:10.840 --> 09:12.840
I can say that I spoke with my father,

09:12.920 --> 09:16.200
other than that, I don't know
how the money was deposited.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.320
I know for a fact
that I asked my father for it,

09:19.400 --> 09:20.840
and he saw to it somehow.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.320
In the end, he transferred
a large amount to settle the matter.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.880
When you refer to your father,
do you usually call him "that guy"?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.840
-Yes, I might say that.
-"Yes, I might say that."

09:36.920 --> 09:40.560
I might,
it may not be very gracious, but I might.

09:43.920 --> 09:48.000
If police investigations found
that Lawyer Cappellano Seminara

09:48.080 --> 09:50.720
had brought and delivered sums of money

09:50.800 --> 09:53.320
at 10:30 p.m. to Saguto,

09:53.840 --> 09:57.480
I think that the most basic
and logical police procedure

09:57.560 --> 10:01.360
would have required, at the very least,
an immediate search

10:01.440 --> 10:04.240
and possible seizure
of the amount of money

10:04.320 --> 10:07.320
Seminara was allegedly bringing to Saguto.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.400
No money was delivered.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.000
It was a document
about the renovation of a hotel,

10:16.600 --> 10:20.040
which makes sense
given the date in question.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.080
CAPPELLANO SEMINARA'S LAWYER

10:23.160 --> 10:24.760
I wanted to show you a document,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.320
which I'm asking to present as evidence.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.920
Was this the document

10:31.000 --> 10:33.160
that Lawyer Cappellano brought
that evening?

10:39.440 --> 10:43.680
Yes, yes, that's it.
The famous document of all our labors.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.760
Thank you.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.960
No further questions.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.640
Let's go.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.240
When Maniaci left,
he said something that

11:03.320 --> 11:05.600
one of my public defenders heard, he said,

11:05.680 --> 11:07.800
"Fine, I get it.
They'll all be acquitted."

11:09.440 --> 11:11.360
I don't know if he was upset about it.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.640
He should be, just like everyone,
everyone who wants the truth to come out.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.440
He shouldn't just want a conviction
one way or the other.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.760
When I saw Saguto
sitting on the other side of the stand…

11:28.080 --> 11:31.160
I didn't think she felt
the way she had made us feel.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.600
She will never feel how we felt.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.640
At least she is getting a fair trial.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.040
The people who were victims
of preventive measures

11:43.640 --> 11:45.120
never got that opportunity.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.720
We're not ashamed of our name,

11:51.440 --> 11:54.080
and we know that in the business world,

11:54.160 --> 11:56.760
Cavallotti doesn't mean Mafia.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.200
It means people who were victims,

11:59.280 --> 12:02.960
first of the Mafia
and then of a certain anti-Mafia.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.120
MAY 2019

12:18.520 --> 12:20.480
Murder in Belmonte Mezzagno.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.760
Antonio Di Liberto was killed
this morning by multiple gunshots.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.920
Di Liberto didn't have
any previous convictions,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.440
but his cousin
is the informant Filippo Bisconti,

12:31.520 --> 12:34.720
the man who facilitated
the arrest of several Mafia members.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.320
The initial reports suggest this may be
a message sent to the informant

12:39.400 --> 12:41.120
through the killing of a relative.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.000
We're standing
at the site of the shooting,

12:50.720 --> 12:53.360
the investigators say, "By the Mafia."

12:54.800 --> 13:00.520
Antonio Di Liberto, 49 years old,
an accountant in Belmonte Messagno.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.720
The Cavallottis were also his clients.

13:05.760 --> 13:10.400
The Mafia are the first to be blamed
because then the investigators look good.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.240
We're confident that the Mafia
has nothing to do with this.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.640
TWO WEEKS LATER

13:24.920 --> 13:28.760
FILIPPO BISCONTI, INFORMANT
AND FORMER MAFIA BOSS IN BELMONTE

13:28.840 --> 13:30.160
MAKES NEW ALLEGATIONS

13:34.200 --> 13:36.320
"Informant against
the Cavallottis."

13:36.400 --> 13:38.600
"The sons were front men
for their fathers."

13:40.400 --> 13:42.960
I've known the Cavallottis
since we were kids,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.440
and I know that they were mafiosos.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.120
Maniaci is defending the Cavallottis.

13:50.360 --> 13:54.120
I think the only way he can respond
to this article is staying quiet.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.440
If he defends them again,
I think he could get arrested

13:56.520 --> 13:57.960
for aiding and abetting.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.520
This is all science-fiction.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.680
How did this informant
come into being after 20 years?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.680
When the prosecutor's office
finds itself in trouble,

14:09.760 --> 14:11.160
it starts performing magic.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.600
Generally, mafiosos
abide by the code of silence.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.080
The Cavallottis
have been shouting for 20 years.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.640
In general, those who shout are innocent.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.880
Rather than "heirs," we say "children"
because in this trial, we're not…

14:27.960 --> 14:30.040
The Cavallottis were nobodies.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.200
They couldn't have achieved what they did
without help from the Mafia.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.800
I was shocked
when I read Bisconti's statements.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.640
I think that Mr. Bisconti

14:50.720 --> 14:54.200
made these statements
because he was tired of being in jail.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.480
I don't know who this is or what he did,

14:59.560 --> 15:01.040
because Mr. Bisconti,

15:01.800 --> 15:03.200
I didn't know what he did.

15:04.760 --> 15:09.400
I don't know. We've never had
a relationship with this person because…

15:11.560 --> 15:15.120
that kind of person makes me sick.
They're scum.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.880
JUNE 2019

15:40.480 --> 15:45.440
IN MANIACI'S TRIAL, THE PROSECUTION CALLS
ITS LAST WITNESS, MAJOR DE CHIRICO

15:46.760 --> 15:48.280
It was nine and a half.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.680
De Chirico was the commander
at the Carabinieri Station in Partinico.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.840
The prosecution is trying
to use De Chirico

15:56.920 --> 15:59.640
to prove that Maniaci is an extortionist.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.560
Thanks.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.360
Above all,
De Chirico manages all the wiretaps.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.960
It's tough to prepare for this

16:07.040 --> 16:10.080
because it's about officials
in the Carabinieri

16:10.160 --> 16:12.440
and the district attorney's office
in Palermo.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.520
We're not naive.
Pino Maniaci knows that this isn't a joke

16:16.600 --> 16:18.480
and that it could go very badly.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.920
They say that they followed me
and listened to me for three years.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.640
I was recorded.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.320
I was followed, tailed, you know…

16:29.840 --> 16:34.400
They even knew the most intimate
and personal things about me.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.080
And they couldn't find one fucking crime!

16:41.160 --> 16:44.360
So Captain De Chirico
had to make something up…

16:46.600 --> 16:48.040
to take me to trial

16:48.760 --> 16:50.280
and even ask for my arrest.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.800
For us,

16:54.960 --> 16:59.480
De Chirico is someone
that we'll try to present to the judge

16:59.560 --> 17:02.520
as the mastermind
of an unjustified operation.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.960
MANIACI'S TRIAL
EXTORTION CHARGE

17:07.040 --> 17:08.800
WITNESS: DE CHIRICO

17:10.120 --> 17:14.000
MAJOR

17:16.480 --> 17:18.760
I don't think
even Totò Riina had this much.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.160
These investigations started
when today's defendant

17:27.240 --> 17:32.160
entered Mayor De Luca's office,
and, let's say, took some money.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.000
We couldn't understand why,

17:36.080 --> 17:38.640
if he was attacking
the mayor on television,

17:39.520 --> 17:41.880
why would he ask him, the same person

17:41.960 --> 17:44.920
that he had previously attacked,
for money?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.920
So, Mr. Ingroia,
Maniaci's attorney.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.400
Listen, did you get hold of the video

17:53.480 --> 17:57.760
of the Telejato broadcasts,
the news, any of that?

18:01.960 --> 18:04.240
We've identified
what's relevant to the case.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.680
Great. How many did you get roughly,
five, ten, twenty?

18:08.760 --> 18:10.920
I… I don't remember
the number specifically,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.920
but we got around four or five videos.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.880
The question is if the changes
to Telejato's editorial objectives

18:18.960 --> 18:20.080
were investigated

18:20.160 --> 18:23.800
following his alleged receipt
of this money. This is the question.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.280
Not necessarily.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.520
Major, in regard to the videos
you watched,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.960
to see if this extortion took place,

18:32.480 --> 18:36.200
did you check to see if,
after the money was handed over,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.000
Maniaci stopped talking about the Mafia?

18:39.520 --> 18:43.640
If after the rehiring,
did Maniaci stop attacking Lo Biundo?

18:44.160 --> 18:46.640
Did you investigate this or not?

18:48.080 --> 18:51.040
It seems
like a clear enough question, Major.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.000
-Look, what do you want me to say?
-Well, tell me what you have to say!

18:56.080 --> 18:57.800
I already
answered the question.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.520
Tell me again. I didn't follow.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.120
It's clear, Major,
that to answer this question,

19:05.640 --> 19:09.840
you need to have watched all the reports
over a period of time. Did you do that?

19:10.360 --> 19:13.080
No, we just watched
what was relevant to the case.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.560
We have archives with hundreds
of reports against the mayor of Borgetto,

19:23.080 --> 19:26.440
and not even one is in his favor.
Not even one.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.480
The local politicians
should all be put out to pasture.

19:35.000 --> 19:35.960
I challenge anyone

19:36.040 --> 19:37.080
to find a report

19:37.160 --> 19:40.080
where we've said
that this administration works,

19:40.160 --> 19:42.600
that this administration is functional.

19:43.120 --> 19:43.960
Day after day,

19:44.040 --> 19:46.840
we continue to discover bad practices

19:46.920 --> 19:48.960
carried out by this administration.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.280
They have fuck all on me.
This is the proof.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.080
But the prosecution didn't need it.
They just want to smear shit on me

20:01.160 --> 20:04.400
with these questions
about my private life. That's it.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.440
Now, as for the investigations
pertaining to today's trial,

20:11.520 --> 20:14.760
tell me, in relation to number 5128,

20:14.840 --> 20:15.800
who is this woman?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.480
Shit. This? Really?

20:22.080 --> 20:26.400
So, on November 28th, 2014,
in the evening,

20:26.920 --> 20:28.280
we wiretapped a phone call.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.360
From the tone of the call, it was clear
that the husband was mad, angry

20:33.440 --> 20:37.520
because he was asking today's defendant
not to contact his wife anymore.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.400
WIRETAPPED PHONE CALL

20:41.480 --> 20:44.120
BETWEEN PINO MANIACI
AND HIS LOVER'S HUSBAND

20:47.280 --> 20:49.680
I'll run you over with my car.
I'll kill you.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.840
I don't give a shit if I'm arrested.
I'm not scared of you, Pino.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.720
-Bye. I'm eating right now. Bye.
-Are you eating, Pino?

20:56.800 --> 20:59.200
Better call the cops, I'm coming, Pino.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.120
I'm coming to the office.
I'll beat your son Giovanni to death.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.320
I'll beat all your children to death.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.080
Don't laugh, whoremonger,
that's what you are.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.280
So, tell me about the evidence
relating to the dogs that were hanged.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.040
The day after the act of intimidation,

21:21.120 --> 21:24.560
which was the two dogs
being hanged outside the TV station,

21:25.160 --> 21:29.400
he called his colleagues, and he told them
it was organized crime that had done it,

21:29.480 --> 21:32.080
or that it was linked
to his work as a journalist.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.600
I know the Mafia.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.280
They intimidate, they threaten.
They killed my dogs.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.040
I'll forgive some things they did,
but what stings the most

21:45.120 --> 21:47.000
was when they took it out on my dogs.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.480
That really killed me.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.680
From our investigations,
it was found that there were no threats

21:59.760 --> 22:00.960
from organized crime…

22:03.040 --> 22:04.560
just from the lady's husband.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.680
WIRETAPPED PHONE CALL
BETWEEN PINO AND HIS LOVER

22:09.200 --> 22:11.000
DECEMBER 2014

22:13.560 --> 22:16.360
He killed my dogs tonight.
I'll kill him.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.360
I swear I'll fucking kill him.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.320
I found my two dogs hanged,
what a swine!

22:29.400 --> 22:32.960
We wanted to have you here
to tell you that we're thinking of you.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.320
This applause is for you

22:34.840 --> 22:37.840
from everyone here
in the studio, as always.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.840
In December, two years ago,

22:40.920 --> 22:43.760
his dogs were tortured
and killed by persons unknown.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.880
It seemed to be a threat from the Mafia.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.720
Wiretaps revealed, however,

22:48.800 --> 22:51.080
that it was not a threat from the Mafia

22:51.160 --> 22:52.720
but from his lover's husband.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.720
The story of the dogs came up.

22:59.800 --> 23:04.280
The dogs being killed has nothing to do
with the charges against Pino,

23:04.360 --> 23:07.600
and yet, he must be found guilty
in the eyes of the media

23:07.680 --> 23:09.480
before a verdict is reached.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.480
And why is that?
Because then, even if he is acquitted,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.520
he will still suffer the consequences.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.040
MAY 2016

23:23.120 --> 23:25.880
Pino, the Carabinieri
also gave us other recordings.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.800
The recording about the dogs--

23:27.880 --> 23:30.400
We're talking about the dogs,
so we can clear up--

23:30.480 --> 23:33.320
Let me finish. Let me finish.
The wiretap about--

23:34.000 --> 23:35.840
The dogs have nothing to do with it,

23:36.880 --> 23:39.800
but he rightfully
explained it nonetheless.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.200
This is a conversation
between him and this woman.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.560
He was trying to get an upper hand
in their relationship,

23:47.640 --> 23:51.520
by making her think
that her husband had killed his dogs.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.800
It's obvious that this was a lie,
but so what?

23:55.880 --> 24:01.320
Is lying to a woman a crime?
No. Is that what this has come to?

24:05.080 --> 24:08.480
Pino Maniaci was considered
as an icon of the anti-Mafia movement.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.920
PRIME MINISTER 2014 - 2016

24:10.000 --> 24:11.240
I gave him my support

24:11.320 --> 24:15.120
after what seemed to be an attack,
a threat from the Mafia.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.120
Of course, I wouldn't make
that phone call today,

24:18.640 --> 24:22.000
it was a call in solidarity
against the Mafia.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.720
JULY 2019

24:27.800 --> 24:30.840
Bravo, bravo.
Watch out for the chief of police!

24:34.160 --> 24:35.920
Now look here, look here, Chief.

24:41.880 --> 24:46.120
The truth is, in Italy,
and particularly in Sicily,

24:46.200 --> 24:50.600
it's never black and white,
there are many, many shades of gray.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.160
And you can
be morally reprehensible, sure…

24:58.560 --> 25:00.840
okay, but to be legally reprehensible,

25:00.920 --> 25:03.040
you have to have committed
an actual crime.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.280
Your saving grace
is your daughter, Letizia.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.080
No doubts about that.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.760
Of course, people were shocked
by everything at first,

25:13.840 --> 25:17.560
but we've had three years
to explain what happened, and bit by bit

25:17.640 --> 25:18.840
they've understood.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.000
It's like a phoenix,

25:20.080 --> 25:23.800
first, they die in the flames,
then they rise from the ashes.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.520
And we're rising. What do you think?

25:27.320 --> 25:28.320
Whatever you think.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.320
NOVEMBER 2019

25:44.800 --> 25:48.880
Our moment is here, we finished with all
the witnesses for the prosecution,

25:48.960 --> 25:51.480
and we'll start hearing the witnesses
for the defense.

25:52.160 --> 25:56.080
THE DEFENSE CALLS GIOACCHINO POLIZZI,
A POLITICIAN FROM BORGETTO

25:56.160 --> 25:57.360
TO THE STAND

25:59.960 --> 26:02.920
The prosecution
considers Gioacchino Polizzi

26:03.000 --> 26:04.600
a victim of extortion,

26:05.240 --> 26:08.600
but they decided not to call him,
saying that,

26:09.120 --> 26:11.960
"The wiretap is so conclusive
that we don't need to hear him."

26:12.560 --> 26:15.040
WIRETAPPED PHONE CALL
BETWEEN GIOACCHINO POLIZZI AND MAYOR DAVÌ

26:16.040 --> 26:17.240
MAY 2013

26:19.200 --> 26:22.040
He extorted me.
He wanted free t-shirts,

26:22.120 --> 26:25.920
and three months rent on a house
that I had to pay out of my own pocket!

26:26.000 --> 26:27.240
This is extortion!

26:27.320 --> 26:29.560
I'll get ten lawyers and destroy Telejato.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.080
Pino Maniaci told us that he had never
rented anything from Polizzi,

26:34.560 --> 26:36.920
and he had never asked for any t-shirts.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.080
It's in our interest
to ask Gioacchino Polizzi to clarify this.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.080
MANIACI'S TRIAL
EXTORTION CHARGE

26:46.160 --> 26:48.280
WITNESS: POLIZZI

26:50.920 --> 26:54.080
Let's begin.
Gioacchino Polizzi, please take the stand.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.720
Mr. Polizzi,
do you know a certain Mr. Davì?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.760
-Of course, he was the mayor.
-He was also the mayor…

27:06.280 --> 27:07.120
I was in his cabinet.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.240
Indeed. And in this wiretap,
it would seem that you are complaining

27:11.320 --> 27:14.440
about some t-shirts
that you supplied to Pino Maniaci,

27:14.960 --> 27:16.840
that Pino Maniaci never paid you for,

27:17.440 --> 27:20.480
and some rent
that Pino Maniaci owed you in Borgetto.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.680
I would like you to explain how--

27:25.480 --> 27:28.080
I don't remember the phone call
because it was so long ago.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.240
I don't remember the rent at all
because I never let a house

27:31.320 --> 27:32.280
to Pino Maniaci

27:32.360 --> 27:34.440
because I don't own any houses.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.160
Did you supply
any t-shirts to Pino Maniaci?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.080
Absolutely not.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.360
So, since you don't remember
the phone call,

27:48.440 --> 27:50.640
I'll read some of the things
that you said.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.240
I've read them as well.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.600
"He forced me to give him the house."

27:56.160 --> 27:57.960
I was forced
to give him the house.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.960
I was forced to give him the t-shirts.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.680
It's only Mafia when he says so!

28:01.760 --> 28:04.400
Why me?
I've got nothing to do with these people.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.520
I honestly don't remember
the call that well.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.840
You go on to say, "This is extortion."

28:16.400 --> 28:18.840
This is extortion,
pure extortion!

28:18.920 --> 28:21.000
He's a mafioso! He has extorted me!

28:22.720 --> 28:24.960
Ma'am, I'm saying
that he didn't extort me.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.000
I'm Gioacchino Polizzi.
I have my own problems,

28:29.080 --> 28:32.920
but nobody should fuck with me.
World War III is going to happen here.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.040
Talk to Pino Maniaci. Understand?

28:35.560 --> 28:38.320
"I'm going to start World War III,
and tell everybody--"

28:38.920 --> 28:41.240
If he was attacking me, I don't remember.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.280
-What crimes did he commit?
-Maybe this phone call means something.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.120
Or maybe we're imposing meaning.
I don't remember the call.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.760
But that's what you said.
Do you remember saying it?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.960
On the phone, yes, maybe I said it
by accident. It just came out.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.480
-I don't know. I don't remember. Ma'am.
-Okay.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.840
-Thank you, Your Honor…
-Okay.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.600
In May 2013,

29:07.680 --> 29:12.360
we did a report on the Borgetto Council
which called out Gioacchino Polizzi.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.080
ELECTIONS AND MAFIA

29:16.160 --> 29:18.800
Borgetto is preparing
for local elections,

29:18.880 --> 29:21.640
and three of the candidates for mayor
stink of Mafia,

29:21.720 --> 29:23.880
it's like we're all one big family.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.760
Polizzi is angry,
and he calls the then Mayor Davì

29:30.840 --> 29:32.720
and says all these things about me,

29:32.800 --> 29:36.000
and that's why they're trying to use
his words against me.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.920
Is it possible that, at the time,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.040
based on your anger at the TV report,

29:47.600 --> 29:50.600
you said some things
that weren't true on the phone to Davì?

29:53.520 --> 29:55.760
The meaning of the call?
Are we still talking about that?

29:55.840 --> 29:58.440
-Yes or no? Is that possible?
-Perhaps.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.560
No further questions.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.080
-Fine, thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.840
While everyone else is backtracking,

30:14.240 --> 30:15.840
pretending not to remember,

30:15.920 --> 30:18.480
not owning up to the truth,
not telling the truth,

30:20.360 --> 30:23.480
in the end, the only person
who had the courage

30:23.560 --> 30:27.600
to say, "Pino Maniaci
extorted money from me," was me.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.000
Gioacchino Polizzi is a business owner
and local politician.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.120
Polizzi's story is important to show

30:39.200 --> 30:40.880
how Maniaci's system works.

30:42.560 --> 30:46.280
In 2013, I was running for mayor
and Polizzi was running with me.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.520
Pino Maniaci started attacking
the candidates,

30:51.600 --> 30:55.280
and in particular,
focused his attacks on my group.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.080
A few months after I was elected,

31:00.600 --> 31:04.000
Polizzi moved to the opposition,
and I lost my majority.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.120
Pino Maniaci did not attack him at all,

31:08.200 --> 31:09.800
in fact, he destroyed me.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.880
Then our group was dissolved
because of suspected Mafia infiltration.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.040
In the last elections,
Polizzi was running.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.520
We saw that the TV station
wasn't attacking him.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.680
Why?It's obvious.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.160
Here, it works like this,
if you work in politics,

31:32.240 --> 31:35.040
you need to stay
on Pino Maniaci's good side.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.440
Only then can you be a politician.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.040
The Maniaci trial
was mainly to cloud the issue.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.160
If Pino Maniaci accuses Saguto,
but he is a criminal,

32:00.240 --> 32:03.240
and Saguto is also indicted,
they are both indicted.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.040
Which one of them is guilty,
and which one is innocent?

32:06.120 --> 32:08.000
What's right, and what's wrong?

32:12.320 --> 32:13.160
Both guilty?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.200
Maybe they're both innocent.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.680
AS SILVANA SAGUTO'S TRIAL DRAWS TO A CLOSE

32:34.760 --> 32:38.920
JOURNALISTS FROM THE TABLOID NEWS PROGRAM
LE IENE INCREASE THE PRESSURE

32:41.360 --> 32:44.040
NOVEMBER 2019

32:48.040 --> 32:50.960
For the first time,
I was ambushed by journalists,

32:51.480 --> 32:55.200
who instead of asking questions
or asking for an interview

32:55.720 --> 32:57.560
were pushing insinuations.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.520
They took the things
I allegedly did for granted

33:00.600 --> 33:02.920
and were saying, "No, you did this,"

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
and I was so angry because I said,

33:05.520 --> 33:08.040
"How do you know
whether I did these things?"

33:08.680 --> 33:12.760
Until there's a sentence that proves it,
you can't say anything.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.840
I'm still presumed innocent.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.560
And now that we're getting close
to the verdict,

33:25.080 --> 33:27.480
they want to somehow
manipulate public opinion

33:27.560 --> 33:30.400
and, once again,
shine a spotlight on this trial

33:30.480 --> 33:32.400
that was born from media influence,

33:32.920 --> 33:35.400
from a media uproar
that was created on purpose.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.720
LE IENE AIR FOUR REPORTS  NATIONALLY

33:38.800 --> 33:41.480
BROADCASTING THE RECORDINGS
OF SILVANA SAGUTO

33:42.000 --> 33:45.120
Your husband doesn't have
experience with dockyards, does he?

33:45.200 --> 33:48.000
-That's right.
-Okay, I'll give him the job.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.120
They haven't paid.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.320
Lorenzo, don't worry.
It's coming.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.800
I'm absolutely furious, Elio.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.320
I'll make him pay.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.440
What a nightmare.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.520
Her world is collapsing around her.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.240
Media influence

34:12.320 --> 34:14.840
is one of the worst things
about our democracy.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.120
They've already reached a verdict.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.320
We believe and we hope
that the result of the trial

34:26.400 --> 34:29.080
can give Silvana Saguto her dignity back,

34:29.640 --> 34:31.280
restore her honor,

34:31.360 --> 34:34.920
her decorum, and the authority
that she has lost.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.160
FEBRUARY 2020

34:47.760 --> 34:50.200
THE PROSECUTION MAKES
ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS

34:50.280 --> 34:53.560
BY LAW THEY HAVE TO STATE
THEIR SELECTED SENTENCE

35:01.280 --> 35:03.280
Following the closing statements,

35:03.360 --> 35:06.720
the prosecutor's office
makes the following requests.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.600
In regard to Silvana Saguto,

35:17.680 --> 35:20.880
we ask that she be found guilty
of all charges,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.840
and sentenced to 15 years
and 10 months in prison.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.640
This request makes them look ridiculous.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.000
They had already said
that they wanted to make an example of me.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.280
They want the sentence
that the public is expecting.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.120
It's no coincidence that the media frenzy

35:50.200 --> 35:53.720
took place
just before the closing arguments.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.560
They're playing to the masses.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.400
I will only be satisfied
with a full acquittal.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.520
I'll fight till the end

36:15.600 --> 36:18.840
to make them understand
that what they've done to me

36:18.920 --> 36:21.800
was done
to give the Mafia a chance to rise again.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.200
We'll see what happens,
because I have the impression

36:29.280 --> 36:32.240
that these two trials
will end up finishing

36:32.320 --> 36:33.360
at the same time.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.000
But if Saguto gets more than ten years,

36:38.080 --> 36:40.280
they might arrest her in the courtroom.
