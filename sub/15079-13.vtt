DR. PIERCE.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.863
NOW,
I'M SURE YOU KNOW

40:04.863 --> 40:09.488
THAT THE CIA HAS A LONG HISTORY
OF WORKING WITH ACADEMIA.

40:09.488 --> 40:10.949
PERHAPS WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

40:18.206 --> 40:21.039
Daniel: THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN A LIAR.

40:21.039 --> 40:24.963
WE ALL FEEL THAT WAY, RIGHT?
BUT WHY?

40:24.963 --> 40:26.635
WHY DO WE TAKE SUCH EXCEPTION

40:26.635 --> 40:29.217
TO SOMEBODY PULLING
THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES?

40:29.217 --> 40:31.219
'CAUSE IT FEELS LOUSY.

40:31.219 --> 40:32.681
LITERALLY.

40:32.681 --> 40:36.314
DISBELIEF GETS PROCESSED
BY THE LIMBIC SYSTEM'S

40:36.314 --> 40:39.728
CINGULATE CORTEX
AND THE ANTERIOR INSULA --

40:39.728 --> 40:42.561
THE SAME PARTS OF THE BRAIN
THAT REPORT

40:42.561 --> 40:45.443
VISCERAL SENSATIONS
LIKE PAIN AND DISGUST.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.866
THIS NOT ONLY EXPLAINS
WHY WE HATE LIARS

40:47.866 --> 40:51.449
BUT WHY WE AS HUMAN BEINGS LONG
FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN.

40:56.374 --> 40:58.206
WHETHER IT BE SANTA CLAUS

40:58.206 --> 41:00.709
OR A SCIENTIFIC FACT
LIKE GRAVITY,

41:00.709 --> 41:05.253
OUR BRAINS REWARD US EMOTIONALLY
WHEN WE BELIEVE.

41:05.253 --> 41:08.757
TO BELIEVE IS TO FEEL GOOD.

41:08.757 --> 41:11.139
TO FEEL COMFORTED.

41:11.139 --> 41:13.972
BUT HOW CAN WE TRUST
OUR OWN BELIEF SYSTEMS

41:13.972 --> 41:17.806
WHEN OUR BRAINS ARE GIVING THEM
EMOTIONAL KICKBACKS?

41:17.806 --> 41:21.269
BY BALANCING IT ALL
WITH CRITICAL THINKING,

41:21.269 --> 41:27.105
BY QUESTIONING EVERYTHING,
AND BY ALWAYS, ALWAYS...

41:27.105 --> 41:29.157
BEING OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITIES.
