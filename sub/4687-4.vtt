WEBVTT

01:28.005 --> 01:29.464
- Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.924
That is a subpoena for a reporter
to appear before a grand jury.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.385
If they had grand juries in East Germany
and East Germany still existed,

01:34.470 --> 01:35.720
then that's where we'd be right now.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.929
Put it away, Rebecca.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.222
And nobody says a word about this

01:38.307 --> 01:39.932
- to anyone tonight.
- What happens now?

01:40.017 --> 01:42.351
Monday morning,
he'll appear before a grand jury.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.854
He'll be asked to name
his source and he'll say...

01:44.938 --> 01:46.939
-No problem.
-He'll refuse.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.566
Tuesday morning, the Prosecutor...

01:48.650 --> 01:50.026
Who wants Will's head hung in his den.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.404
...will go to a judge to get an order
for Will to answer the question.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.949
Wednesday morning, armed with the order,
the Prosecutor will ask him again

01:57.034 --> 01:58.534
and he'll refuse again.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.995
Thursday morning,
we appear before the same judge,

02:01.079 --> 02:02.371
who the Prosecutor will inform

02:02.456 --> 02:04.749
that Will has refused to comply
with a court order and then...

02:04.833 --> 02:07.627
-Everybody goes home.
-Because you're too big to jail?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.962
-That's right.
-Will, you've been wrong about everything.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.006
-Every step of the way.
-Do you really think this administration

02:12.090 --> 02:14.300
-will lock up a reporter...
-I didn't think they'd raid a newsroom,

02:14.384 --> 02:15.927
-that happened.
-...who exposed a disinformation campaign

02:16.011 --> 02:16.969
that resulted...

02:17.054 --> 02:18.971
I didn't think Neal would have to flee,
and he's in Venezuela.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.848
And I didn't think they'd have
the sack to subpoena you,

02:20.933 --> 02:24.060
but you've just been served
by a kid in a rented tuxedo.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.603
And the reason the kid was wearing a tuxedo

02:25.687 --> 02:27.647
was because they don't
want to make any noise.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.109
Or maybe they sent out a press release.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.070
No shit.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.988
-You know what this is gonna be?
-Yeah.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.824
"Will McAvoy, hypocrite in a monkey suit."

02:37.908 --> 02:40.034
It's been posted on Carnivore,
but it's been picked up by everybody.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.786
Carnivore? It was posted on Carnivore?

02:41.870 --> 02:43.162
Also, what the hell is Carnivore?

02:43.247 --> 02:45.665
It's a new website that just got its first scoop.

02:45.749 --> 02:49.669
"ACN won't be attending the saturnalia
of incestuous ingratiation..."

02:49.753 --> 02:51.921
-I remember that.
-"...that does little to instill confidence

02:52.005 --> 02:55.007
"in the public that the press
isn't ensorcelled by the powerful."

02:55.092 --> 02:56.843
-I have to go find someone. Don.
-Mmm.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.470
Lead the team on the Kundu story,

02:59.555 --> 03:01.347
which has to be on the air
by Wednesday night.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.516
That's in... Why does it have to be
on the air by Wednesday night?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
Because it does.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.645
-You and I need to talk.
-Yeah. Not here.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.442
Will, I'm Mimi Tassler with BuzzFeed.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.361
-Nice to meet you.
-Any comment on the story on Carnivore?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.113
I was wrong about
the Correspondents' Dinner.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.323
I forgot what a great time I always have.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.117
Will, I'm Zachary Webber with POLITICO.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.577
-Do you want to comment on the story?
-Sure.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.120
I probably need to read it first.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.664
-I'm going back to the hotel.
-You can't.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.374
-No, I can't stay here.
-Think for a second.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.209
-What's the reason we came here in...
-Pruit.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.711
We have to sit with Pruit.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.255
I've had a minute with him,
and so far it's going badly.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.715
You don't think he's going
to buy the network?

03:35.799 --> 03:37.425
No, I think he is.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.220
- I've never heard of Carnivore.
- It's new.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.471
Why do they have names like that?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.182
<i>Carnivore, Vulture, Beast, Gawker.</i>

03:45.267 --> 03:46.267
I don't know.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.020
And why do gossip columnists
always sound like gossip columnists?

03:49.730 --> 03:53.357
Finke, Weasel, Snitch, Frump.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.735
I'm not familiar
with Snitch, Weasel, and Frump.

03:55.819 --> 03:56.903
What do you read?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.571
Well, I read Jonathan Weasel
on a regular basis

03:58.655 --> 04:00.740
before clicking over to AngrySpiders.com.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.491
-Anyway, my answer to your question...
-Hey!

04:03.327 --> 04:04.368
You'll tell me later.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.538
-We were thinking about calling it a night.
-It's early.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.082
Don and I were just given
a new deadline on a story.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.959
-What's the deadline?
-Wednesday night.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.586
Gonna rent a car
and drive back to New York tonight.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.712
I'll go with you.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.214
Maggie and I were just
discussing an ethical dilemma.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.383
She has a friend who's dating a woman

04:19.468 --> 04:21.844
who just started writing
for a website called Carnivore.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.971
-We should go.
-I just want to hear what they think.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.682
Maggie's friend thinks that
websites like this are toxic

04:26.767 --> 04:28.809
and are poisoning our national
conversation and culture,

04:28.894 --> 04:30.603
but he likes the girl.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.022
So my question is,
would he date a drug dealer?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.946
How would you like to handle this?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.697
-Wait.
-Yeah.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.616
-She works for Carnivore.
-Of course she works for Carnivore.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.993
I just said you'll tell me later
as I waved them over.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.204
How could you not pick up on that cue?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.206
-I've never been good at that.
-You're terrible at that.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.627
Yeah, so we're gonna go get that car
and pick you up at the hotel.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.337
Cool. I...

04:58.715 --> 05:00.049
-Listen.
-Not yet.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.640
-Drug dealer?
-He said that. I didn't say that.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.058
You're talking about this with Maggie?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.810
-It came up at work.
-What came up?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.228
It just...

05:13.772 --> 05:16.649
-Your new job.
-Your disapproval of me came up at work?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.317
The page view incentives in your contract.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.111
They're bonuses, you judgmental prick.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.821
And why don't you believe in me?

05:21.905 --> 05:23.781
Why do you assume that
as soon as I take a job like this,

05:23.865 --> 05:24.991
I'm gonna be an asshole?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.201
-I don't think that you're...
-Yes, you do.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.327
Why?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.498
How did Carnivore get that story about Will?

05:32.749 --> 05:33.958
Did you see my byline on it?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.334
-No.
-No.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.712
2,000 reporters, and he thought
he was going to get away with it?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.338
He didn't knock over a bank.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.174
He sang an aria about how messed
up the Correspondents' Dinner was,

05:42.259 --> 05:44.343
said ACN wasn't going, and then showed up.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.555
You weren't aware of the aria
until I told you about it.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.391
That story was waiting and ready to go
and I'm the one who leaked it.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.809
It wasn't going to be a secret.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.102
You had nothing to do with it?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.691
I told them what to look for.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.694
-Yeah.
-If I hadn't,

06:01.778 --> 06:04.113
I would be betraying my job,
and you know that.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.865
You know that.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.783
It's horrible that I got it from you, but...

06:07.868 --> 06:10.911
Listen, the new HR guy at AWM, Wyatt Earp...

06:10.996 --> 06:13.122
-Not his name.
-Wyatt Geary.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.875
He's onto us, me and Sloan,
and he wants me bad.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.586
He's gonna come asking questions,
and when he does, you say...

06:18.670 --> 06:19.962
Don and Sloan are just colleagues.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.881
Should you guys be standing
next to each other?

06:22.966 --> 06:24.717
Yeah, what are you doing
standing next to me?

06:24.801 --> 06:25.968
I really don't know.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.261
Scatter.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.186
I'm sorry.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.730
I'm sorry, too.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.232
I get it.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.567
Do you?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.948
-Where have you been?
-Looking for someone.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.533
We're supposed to be talking to Pruit.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.161
Listen, a little while ago...

06:52.913 --> 06:53.913
Nothing.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.331
-You sure?
-Yeah.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.166
Let's talk to Pruit.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.512
Lucas.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.932
Books are like the new art, don't you think?

07:13.016 --> 07:15.518
Yes. No. I have no idea what you mean.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.311
We don't need them anymore,
but they look nice.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.022
-We don't need books?
-Not on paper.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.274
I'll send you a Kindle, Grandpa Joe.
You'll like it.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.277
-I'm Will McAvoy.
-MacKenzie McHale.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.279
If you say you're not gonna come to a party

07:27.364 --> 07:29.657
and you say it loud to a million people,

07:29.783 --> 07:32.284
you can't show up to the party.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.746
He came to talk to you because
you said you wanted to meet him at the party.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.624
Why did you want to meet him at the party?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.876
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Take it easy.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.504
I won't take it easy.
The position you put him in,

07:43.588 --> 07:45.005
all of us, for a laugh?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.382
It was not for a laugh.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.883
Don't be a child.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.677
It was an exercise of power.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.846
You shoved the Lansings around for years,

07:51.930 --> 07:53.347
and I wanted to let you know right off the bat

07:53.431 --> 07:54.807
that I'm not impressed by ratings.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.811
Second, I want you to know
that I'm not in this for the trophy.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.063
I'm in it for the ratings. I'm just kidding.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.524
But really, second place does nothing for me.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.734
Good, 'cause as of last week, we're in fourth.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.695
I don't know how you managed to swing that.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.738
I was very proud of our Boston coverage.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.241
Proud is generally what people
pretend they are when they've lost.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.076
Cryptic is generally what people are

08:14.161 --> 08:17.037
when they're trying to pretend
they possess supernatural powers.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.165
Okay, we've gotten off to a rough start.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.209
Lucas, we're naturally curious
about your plans for the network.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.336
What if I told you you could be
the number one news network

08:24.421 --> 08:26.005
and change the world at the same time?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.506
Change it into what?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.551
A place where people say snappy,
sardonic things like that.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.679
Hey, we really have to do better
at talking to each other right now.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.514
-Who are you looking for?
-Me?

08:35.599 --> 08:36.932
You've glanced around a couple of times.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.058
Nothing, I'm here.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.351
Is that accent real?

08:39.436 --> 08:40.686
Can we please cut the shit?

08:40.770 --> 08:43.647
I'm gonna infuse ACN with tens of millions
of new dollars in your budget.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.690
How does that sound?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.026
I'm gonna get 18 to 25-year-olds
to watch the news

08:47.110 --> 08:49.695
so it can support itself
and so it doesn't die when you do.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.239
The news gathering and newscasts
will have tentacles

08:52.324 --> 08:54.950
in every reach of the Internet.
Interactives, podcasts, live streams,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.243
Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.786
We'll make our audience reporters in the field

08:57.871 --> 09:00.497
through Instagram and Vine,
Snapchat and blogs. You still with me?

09:00.582 --> 09:04.210
Our users become the audience
and our audience becomes contributors.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.544
That's my plan.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.380
Needless to say,
I'm impressed by your indifference

09:08.465 --> 09:10.925
to talent, experience and credentials.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.053
And I assume the absence
of the words truth, trust

09:14.137 --> 09:17.806
and professionalism in your
mission statement was an oversight.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.644
Your contempt for the second-rate
seems to be a contradiction, too,

09:21.728 --> 09:25.856
since you believe the best reporting
is done by anyone with a phone

09:25.941 --> 09:28.317
and the time it takes to write "epic fail."

09:28.443 --> 09:29.985
And as an old guy,

09:30.070 --> 09:33.405
I've got a lot more respect
for 18 to 25-year-olds than you do,

09:33.490 --> 09:36.408
'cause I don't believe their heads will explode

09:36.493 --> 09:39.370
if you stop patronizing them
for an hour a night

09:39.454 --> 09:41.705
and tell them
what the fuck's going on in their lives

09:41.790 --> 09:44.416
and maybe even in the lives of other people.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.253
The air up on that pedestal
must be pretty thin,

09:47.337 --> 09:48.921
'cause you are delusional, sir.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.591
If I am, I plan on staying that way.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.760
And my network's staying, too.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.429
We've got a problem now, you and me.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.847
Have a good evening.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.570
You knew that the documents
were stolen by the source?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.322
- Yes, sir.
- You knew the documents were classified?

10:15.407 --> 10:16.407
Yes, sir.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.450
Did Mr. Sampat tell you anything
about the source?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.869
-Yes, sir.
-Did Mr. Sampat tell you his name?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.163
-Yes, sir.
-Will you tell us the name of your source?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.416
-No, sir.
-Let me phrase that differently.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.585
Would you tell the grand jury
the name of the person

10:28.670 --> 10:31.463
you know to have
stolen classified government documents

10:31.548 --> 10:33.799
containing secrets, which, if made public,

10:33.883 --> 10:36.468
could calamitously threaten
our national security?

10:36.553 --> 10:37.761
No, sir, I won't.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.016
At this time I'll excuse the grand jury
until 10:00 a.m. Wednesday,

10:42.100 --> 10:43.600
at which time I will return

10:43.685 --> 10:46.395
with a court order compelling the witness
to answer that question.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.230
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.357
And, Mr. McAvoy, you can step down.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.291
Hey.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.501
Does anybody know
if they got that guy out of the country?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.962
The writer. The guy who wrote the fake story.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.173
Been over a week since
the government's known about the breach.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.175
-They would have pulled him, right?
-You would think so,

11:16.259 --> 11:18.344
but we need to find out.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.138
Oh, come on!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.183
Come on in.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.392
Don't look at any of these papers,

11:25.477 --> 11:27.019
don't look down,
and don't ask anyone what they're doing.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.103
Got it.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.396
I just wanted to ask you in person

11:29.481 --> 11:32.191
why you haven't accepted
my friend request on Instagram.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.154
It was the very next thing I was gonna do.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.239
-How about now?
-Sure.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.367
Gary, toss me my phone.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.452
Martin, can you read this over,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.996
-and if it looks good to you, take it to Mac?
-Sure.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.960
-Accepted.
-Awesome.

11:56.966 --> 11:57.925
Come in.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.802
It's from Don and it says "Take to Sloan,"

11:59.886 --> 12:02.012
and then it says, "Sabbith" in quotes.
So, I was told to read it.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.347
Do you think it meant take to Sloan Sabbith...

12:03.431 --> 12:04.890
Was the new HR guy just down there?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.184
-Yeah, how did you know?
-It's his Instagram password.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.608
Nice try, but my mama didn't raise a fool,
unless you count my brothers.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.068
So I don't know what we just did,

12:16.152 --> 12:17.945
-but I'm gonna go back to work.
-Yeah.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.113
-Hey.
-Have you been outside today?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.990
How do you think I got
from where I live to where I work?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.242
-I just mean it's a gorgeous day.
-Shut up.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.326
All right.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.161
There has to be another way.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.250
There has to be another buyer
for this network in the next...

12:31.334 --> 12:32.876
-Few hours?
-Few days.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.508
Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Antoinette Dodd,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.093
Michael... Michael Bloomberg?

12:41.177 --> 12:43.095
-Do you know any of those people?
-I know all of them.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.179
But Leona and Reese told you

12:44.264 --> 12:46.098
they exhausted all their options
before they went to Pruit.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.768
They exhausted all their options for
keeping control of AWM before selling us,

12:49.853 --> 12:53.439
but they didn't necessarily exhaust
their options of who to sell us to.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.649
Look, I want what you want,

12:55.733 --> 12:58.110
but this is big business
and you're a news director.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.361
You don't know what you're doing.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.779
You can't just write down
names of rich people.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.114
I didn't just write down...

13:02.198 --> 13:04.741
Those are all people
who would be interested in media buys.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.618
Elon Musk isn't interested.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.121
Michael Bloomberg
has his own media company.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.582
Larry Ellison is busy
winning the America's Cup.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.666
Toni Dodd...

13:15.837 --> 13:17.671
-Antoinette Dodd.
-What?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.089
This is unbelievable.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.466
-What?
-It's just...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.260
So help me, Hannah...
I read in Page Six, like, two weeks ago

13:23.344 --> 13:25.012
that Toni Dodd was looking
to buy a media group.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.014
I remember because I thought,

13:27.098 --> 13:29.808
"This is exactly what happens
to Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. "

13:29.893 --> 13:32.561
And, hand to God,
I was on the Staten Island Ferry at the time.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.480
But there was nothing
I could do with that information,

13:34.564 --> 13:37.483
so my mind went to how good
a young Alec Baldwin was in the movie.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.485
And whatever happened
to that Carly Simon song?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.112
You think Toni Dodd
wants to buy a news network?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.656
Page Six wouldn't say it unless it was true.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.868
-And she has in the area of $4 billion?
-That's not how it works.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.786
Nobody has $4 billion.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.163
But, yes, she has $4 billion.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.373
Are you able to call her? She'll take your call?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.250
-Yeah.
-You need to set up a meeting

13:55.335 --> 13:58.003
for her and Leona
as soon as humanly possible.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.506
Leona can't meet with another buyer
while she's negotiating with Pruit.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.842
Friendly, informal, off-the-record meeting?

14:03.927 --> 14:05.177
Pruit will go away.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.054
Not fast or far enough.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.347
I know you don't like the guy, but...

14:08.431 --> 14:11.600
It doesn't matter that I don't like him.
It matters that I'm scared of him.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.270
You were scared of Reese and Leona,
but you turned them around.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.397
You'll fight with Pruit and you'll win.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.691
I don't want to fight with anybody, Sloan.
I'm tired.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.152
I don't want to expand
the definition of the news.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.570
I want to narrow it.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.031
We'll be right back at the beginning,
only worse.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.283
I can't fight these fights with this guy.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.451
I won't win.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.663
We can meet with her.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.208
-You and me?
-Yeah.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.043
But quietly.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.379
'Cause there's one option worse than Pruit,

14:40.463 --> 14:44.091
and that's this place getting sold for parts
and a lot of people out of work.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.635
Very quietly. And now.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.098
How'd it go?

14:51.182 --> 14:52.766
Exactly the way we said it would.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.059
Now Lasenthal goes to a judge

14:54.143 --> 14:55.936
to get court to compel Will
to answer the question.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.564
Now, tell me what's happening in here.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.524
Tell me we'll be able to run
the story by Wednesday night.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.234
We've got the motive,
but we don't have the ringleader.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.402
The motive is what we thought it was?

15:03.486 --> 15:05.779
To disrupt and delay their elections.
We've got that cold.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.906
Elections that would have yielded
a hard-line Islamic government.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.783
Democracy is good
as long as we like the outcome.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.451
- Yes.
- How do you circle that square?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.787
By knowing that Islam is a religion
and not a form of government.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.455
When it becomes one, it is fascism.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.249
-And the 38 dead bodies?
-Are a bargain

15:17.333 --> 15:18.834
compared to what it'll cost us
in blood and money

15:18.918 --> 15:20.669
when we have to bomb the place
five years from now

15:20.753 --> 15:22.254
because it's al-Qaeda's new home office.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.839
But we've got a different problem.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.758
The writer of the story,
we think he's still on the ground.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.844
Don and I are each talking
to a different source at State.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.262
When I asked my source if the writer was out,

15:30.346 --> 15:31.430
he said, "I don't know. Is he?"

15:31.514 --> 15:33.098
They're trying to slow down the story.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.891
Then my guy said, "No, the writer is not out."

15:34.976 --> 15:37.477
-Do you believe him?
-50-50.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.980
But when our story comes out
that this guy worked with the US,

15:40.064 --> 15:42.274
they're gonna slit the throats
of his children right in front of him

15:42.358 --> 15:43.817
and then drag him down Main Street,

15:43.901 --> 15:45.694
so I don't want to pick the wrong 50.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.239
-Extend your arbitrary deadline.
-It's not arbitrary.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.117
Work with State,
get the guy and his family out today.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.243
It's night in Kundu.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.537
The phones don't work
at our embassy at night?

16:04.547 --> 16:05.547
What are you working on?

16:05.882 --> 16:06.882
A piece.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.763
You're not allowed to tell me?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.640
I don't want to fight right now.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.268
I don't either.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.228
I'm really glad you said that.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.397
Do you mean that?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.070
I have to go back to the office tonight.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.449
We're crashing on a deadline
I don't even understand.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.243
I just want to eat my sandwich
near you for a while.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.664
Sometimes you say that,
and then you ambush me.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.375
What are you working on?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.961
My editor wants me to write more personally.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.963
-Like an op-ed?
-Yeah.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.341
-What's wrong with op-eds?
-Nothing.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.593
What are you writing about?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.305
I pitched a few, but the only one they liked
was my experience with the Plan B pill.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.267
Cool.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.439
-Come on.
-I said, "Cool."

17:04.524 --> 17:05.732
You said more than that.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.192
What's wrong with writing in the first person?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.403
What's wrong with sex?
And what's wrong with my new job?

17:09.487 --> 17:12.447
Hallie, I said, "Cool."

17:12.532 --> 17:14.783
You're not going to give me
a hard time about this?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.369
I'm your boyfriend.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.870
It is my role to support you.

17:18.955 --> 17:22.124
It's a role I'm grateful to have,
and I want to do it well.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.087
Thank you. Sorry I jumped the gun.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.463
No problem.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.602
Does your piece begin, "Dear Penthouse,

17:42.687 --> 17:46.314
-"I've never written a letter like this before"?
-Motherfucker!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.753
You know how this is gonna end, right?

18:07.837 --> 18:09.463
Please don't directly address my client.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.549
-We're in chambers, Counselor.
-I don't care if we're in your fucking hot tub.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.719
Hey, I'm on a government salary.
I barely have a bathtub.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.970
Good morning.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.055
-Morning, Judge.
-Good morning, sir.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.767
Does anybody need any coffee or anything?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.518
-No, thank you, Judge.
-No, thank you.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.773
Mr. Lasenthal, how can a man
with your resume possibly let this happen?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.317
Your Honor, there's a limit to my ability

18:30.401 --> 18:32.110
to let or not let things happen.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.445
Not much of a limit.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.240
Mr. McAvoy is aware
of the identity of someone

18:37.325 --> 18:40.702
who has committed in excess
of 27,000 counts of theft

18:40.787 --> 18:43.789
of government property,
disclosure of classified documents

18:43.873 --> 18:46.708
and conspiracy to commit espionage.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.210
The suspect remains at large

18:48.294 --> 18:51.671
and presents a clear
and present danger to national security.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.341
Why is he not protected
by the First Amendment?

18:54.425 --> 18:56.676
Because the court
in Branzburg denied the press

18:56.761 --> 18:58.595
First Amendment protection
when they're subpoenaed

18:58.679 --> 19:01.056
to testify before a grand jury
in a criminal case.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.682
-Counsel?
-Sir,

19:02.767 --> 19:04.184
the court in Branzburg also said

19:04.268 --> 19:07.020
that a journalist need not comply
with a grand jury subpoena

19:07.104 --> 19:09.314
where there's bad faith or harassment.

19:09.398 --> 19:13.443
The government has raided
my client's newsroom, seized hard drives

19:13.528 --> 19:16.488
and threatened him with criminal prosecution
under the Espionage Act.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.157
In this case,
a journalist participated in the crime.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.160
He didn't pull on a ski mask, Judge.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.746
-He may have unwittingly...
-He didn't do anything unwittingly.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.164
He is the senior editor of ACN Digital.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.833
You are speculating on
whether a third party...

19:27.917 --> 19:28.917
All right, all right.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.003
Mr. McAvoy,
is there anything you'd like to say?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.798
I haven't heard a request
from the Prosecutor, sir.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.968
Am I crazy, or have you argued in my court?

19:38.052 --> 19:41.096
You're not crazy, sir.
Brooklyn Criminal Court, Part C.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.516
-How'd I do?
-You were very fair.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.018
Does Your Honor need to recuse himself?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.145
I want counsel to take care of this.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.566
I don't want to see the press on the steps
when I come in to work tomorrow.

19:52.650 --> 19:56.319
And I absolutely don't want to see you
in my courtroom on Thursday,

19:56.404 --> 19:59.155
which I strongly suspect
is what's going to happen

19:59.240 --> 20:01.700
as Mr. McAvoy does not strike me

20:01.784 --> 20:04.369
as someone who is likely to cave,

20:04.453 --> 20:06.204
especially with everybody watching.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.415
It was foolish of you, Mr. Lasenthal.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.750
The DOJ should not have let it go this far.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.004
The Department of Justice,
Your Honor, is not playing a strategic game.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.839
We have to arrest his source,

20:15.923 --> 20:18.049
and the government of the United States
will avail itself

20:18.134 --> 20:20.260
of every legal measure to do that.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.596
The government's request is granted.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.056
Mr. McAvoy, you're directed to appear

20:25.141 --> 20:27.851
before the grand jury at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.731
-I have a logic problem.
-Maggie, what's going on over there?

20:32.815 --> 20:35.567
- His logic is inconsistent.
- How?

20:35.651 --> 20:38.028
He doesn't believe the source
should have leaked classified documents.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.822
-Neither do I.
-But he's unwilling to help law enforcement

20:40.907 --> 20:42.490
capture the source by identifying him.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.243
-He can't. I'd be unwilling and so would you.
-I know,

20:45.328 --> 20:48.538
but following that logic, he should
also not be willing to broadcast the story.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.625
If he believes no one should ever leak
because it poses a critical threat,

20:51.709 --> 20:53.209
then why is he broadcasting the story?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.920
Well, I can't speak for Will, but I will.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.047
This leak, he believes, is a good leak.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.007
What he's very reasonably
worried about is the bad leaks.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.216
So he'd prefer there are no leaks.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.093
You and Will are making
the same unilateral decision

21:02.178 --> 21:03.219
you don't want a leaker to make.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.971
I trust strangers less than I trust me.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.932
Your logic is consistent, though horrifying.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.767
No one's gonna ever guess
you guys are a couple.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.018
All right, listen. Listen up.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.271
He's refusing to leave without his kids,
and his youngest kid doesn't have a passport.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.689
Jesus. All right.
We got to get the kid a passport.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.774
State has to expedite that.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.108
The State Department can
only issue US passports.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.276
They've got to walk over to the embassy.

21:18.361 --> 21:19.736
-And tell them what?
-Where are we?

21:19.862 --> 21:20.946
Just...

21:22.365 --> 21:25.617
We need a favor. Whatever it is they do.
Can I talk to you a minute?

21:31.707 --> 21:34.209
The youngest of his three kids
doesn't have a passport.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.752
State's got 30 hours to get him one.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.253
We are talking to mid-level people,

21:37.338 --> 21:38.964
and the US Department of State
isn't hopping to it

21:39.048 --> 21:40.131
when we give them instructions.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.883
You have to tell me why

21:41.968 --> 21:45.303
we have to air the story tomorrow night
and not a week from tomorrow night.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.856
All right,
I'm gonna be out for about four hours.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.817
Once we run the story,
we've shot the hostage.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.068
Will has no more leverage.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.821
If we don't run the story,
why don't we all just go home?

22:02.905 --> 22:03.905
Four hours.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.824
Don't ask me where I was when I come back.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.163
And what we say is important is important.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.125
The news reflects back to us
our national character,

22:15.209 --> 22:19.087
and I don't like seeing
a bored and boring teenager in the mirror.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.007
What we say is important is important.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.758
It's a solid business, Toni.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.594
Locked-in carriage contracts
with every MVPD, and they're staggered.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.681
The carriage fees are due for a hike
that could double revenues by itself

22:29.765 --> 22:31.224
over the next decade.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.892
Can you talk about valuation?

22:33.436 --> 22:35.186
Earnings before interest?

22:35.271 --> 22:36.855
You'll look at our books
and see it's in the sweet spot,

22:36.939 --> 22:38.398
and the deal would be
accretive to your earnings.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.691
It would pay for itself?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.026
And then some.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.237
Have you decided what you would like?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.282
A news network.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.625
You were on fire in there.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.963
I didn't understand half or, really,
any of what you were saying, but...

23:02.048 --> 23:03.214
You were able to follow when she said

23:03.299 --> 23:04.507
she's meeting with her board on Thursday,

23:04.592 --> 23:07.635
and she thinks we'll have
an answer we'll like?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.889
Just tell me one thing. Is she eccentric?

23:10.973 --> 23:13.558
-How do you mean?
-She didn't eat her food.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.644
She pushed it around a little,
but she plainly doesn't like sushi.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.522
Why set a meeting at a restaurant
where they only serve sushi?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.733
Boss, you may be overthinking that.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.568
That's hardly ever the problem.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.070
We'll find out Thursday.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.453
It's ahead on the left.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.830
Just here.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.804
You can keep the meter running.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.644
No umbrella?

23:57.728 --> 23:59.395
You either.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.356
Should we sit in your car?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.316
They may be tapping my car.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.444
I disabled the GPS, but they can still get in.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.487
We need more time.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.447
-I told you tomorrow night.
-Lilly.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.574
Tomorrow night, or I just have
to upload the documents.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.701
-The writer of the story...
-We're the writer of the story.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.662
Joseph Bartho,
who physically wrote the story,

24:15.746 --> 24:18.498
whose name is on it,
and who is paid by the US government,

24:18.582 --> 24:22.210
is still on the ground because
one of his kids doesn't have a passport yet.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.713
If we run the story before
Bartho and his family are out,

24:25.798 --> 24:29.217
the best-case scenario is
he gets a trial before he's executed.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.970
And if you dump the documents
without them being vetted,

24:32.054 --> 24:34.848
there's a very good chance
other people will be in danger.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.683
You really don't need to speak to me
like I'm dim-witted.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.892
Please lift the deadline.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.853
Give me a reason to trust you.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.312
You already did.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.273
You reached out to us.
Not the other way around.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.941
But you've been talking to the government.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.818
We got an invitation
to talk to the government.

24:46.902 --> 24:47.986
It's called a subpoena.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.572
They also made an unannounced
drop-by called a raid.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.615
I'm not talking about that.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.243
You said that you've been working
with the government to vet the material.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.411
-Of course we are.
-You trust them?

24:57.204 --> 24:58.496
In my way.

24:58.581 --> 25:00.707
You don't trust them any more than I do.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.001
Please lift the deadline.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.296
I reached out to Neal, not to you.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.091
Well, Neal's in Venezuela, Lilly.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.093
And you know what? Why aren't you?

25:13.596 --> 25:16.222
Why haven't you said,
"This has gone too far. Let's switch places.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.683
"I'll go to a country with no extradition treaty.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.352
"You're now free to disclose my name.
Neal can come home

25:21.437 --> 25:23.813
"and Will can stop spending his days
in front of a grand jury."

25:23.898 --> 25:24.939
Why hasn't that happened?

25:25.024 --> 25:29.194
You really think the price
for telling the truth should be that high?

25:31.614 --> 25:32.614
No, I don't.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.619
I promise this story will be reported.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.038
Well, I can't promise anything.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.331
Really?

25:41.415 --> 25:42.749
Look, McAvoy's a Republican.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.959
-I know he thinks I'm a criminal.
-He's a journalist.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.085
His politics don't have anything...

25:46.170 --> 25:48.379
"Worst-period-generation-
period-ever-period."

25:48.464 --> 25:50.215
That was spoken in the middle
of a very difficult...

25:50.299 --> 25:52.634
I reached out to Neal,
so I can't promise anything.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.389
You know, it wouldn't matter if you did.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.600
I trust you less than I trust them.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.978
Dump the documents and I'll quit my job,

26:04.063 --> 26:06.648
walk to the FBI and give them your name.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.609
-Trust that.
-Fuck you.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.323
We can go back to the airport now.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.914
Mr. McAvoy, I have here a court order

26:22.998 --> 26:25.416
directing you to tell us
the name of the individual

26:25.501 --> 26:27.168
that is the target of this investigation.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.836
Will you comply with the court order?

26:28.921 --> 26:30.004
No, sir.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.131
You won't comply with the court order?

26:32.216 --> 26:33.508
No, sir.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.181
I saw a lot of spirit in that shot, a lot of guts.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.641
Shut it, Fast Eddie.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.936
Why are hot women
in movies always great at pool?

26:45.020 --> 26:47.939
Is that what men like?
A hot girl who plays nine-ball?

26:48.023 --> 26:49.440
You could have said anything after "hot girl"

26:49.525 --> 26:50.942
-and the answer would have been...
-All right.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.781
Oh, brother.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.324
What happened?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.702
-Hallie posted a column. You ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:01.245 --> 27:05.290
An Analog Romance."

27:05.374 --> 27:07.166
-What's it about?
-What do you think it's about?

27:07.251 --> 27:08.793
-Them?
-Yeah.

27:08.877 --> 27:12.630
It's pretty personal, but in her defense,
she doesn't use his name.

27:12.715 --> 27:13.715
What does she call him?

27:13.799 --> 27:14.799
-Jim?
-Yeah.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.176
Tim.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.804
Hallie is an excellent reporter.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.098
And she's reporting on a fight
she's having with her boyfriend.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.182
She's working a tough beat.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.934
-It's a lot more than that.
-Okay, read it.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.021
"My boyfriend loves me,
but he doesn't like me.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.482
"He definitely doesn't follow me.
He disapproves of me."

27:31.567 --> 27:34.652
Maybe he just disapproves of
using the word "me" four times in the lede.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.738
How would you have written it instead?

27:36.822 --> 27:37.989
I'm not a professional writer,

27:38.073 --> 27:39.741
but I'd have maybe
tweaked the opening so it read,

27:39.825 --> 27:42.368
"I am not making my private life
and the private lives of others

27:42.453 --> 27:44.829
"available for entertainment
so I can get comments like,

27:44.913 --> 27:46.205
"'You stay strong, Hallie.'

27:46.290 --> 27:48.708
"'He doesn't deserve you."'
Seven in the corner.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.753
I have been a witness to Jim
being a condescending...

27:52.838 --> 27:54.380
Look, there's nothing wrong with this.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.008
It's relatable and interesting
and she can write like crazy.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.802
Did she ask Jim's permission
before deputizing him into her well-written...

27:59.887 --> 28:02.138
Why are you so quick to defend Jim?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.931
Why are you so quick to defend Hallie?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.142
Because she's going to be attacked by Jim.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.519
Probably not in print,
but I don't think that's the reason.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.898
I'm always grateful when a man can tell me
why I'm thinking what I'm thinking.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.317
You're into Jim
and you don't want to be a jealous cliché,

28:14.401 --> 28:16.694
so you defend Hallie for show.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.821
And it's a classy thing to do,

28:18.906 --> 28:21.532
but at some point we're going to
have to discuss how that makes me feel

28:21.617 --> 28:25.328
to know that any man in your life
is going to be the runner-up.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.580
You really believe that?

28:59.488 --> 29:00.988
Still got my security key.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.458
-This place has gone to hell without me.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.261
It's almost 1:00 in the morning, Jim.

29:23.345 --> 29:27.140
Are you not coming home
or answering my calls or texts?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.980
I told you my editor wanted me
to write more personally.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.444
There are classified documents in this room.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.695
You can't be in here.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.924
It was an invasion of privacy.
I'm really sorry for that.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.926
I was mad. We had just had the last fight,

30:04.011 --> 30:06.554
and I went into the other room and wrote it.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.973
You know my computer doesn't trust me.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.975
It always asks,
"Are you sure you want to do this?"

30:11.059 --> 30:12.602
But it never asks before I hit...

30:12.686 --> 30:15.480
I don't care about the invasion of privacy.
I wish I did.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.400
I've been here for hours

30:19.485 --> 30:22.361
trying to make myself mad
because it was an invasion of privacy.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.822
And the crowd would be on my side.
That's a no-brainer.

30:24.907 --> 30:28.534
-You don't like me very much.
-And I wish I didn't like you so much.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.996
Took five fucking days, Hallie,

30:32.080 --> 30:33.706
for you to give yourself
your own reality show.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.626
I understand your wanting
to insult me right now,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.461
but that's not what I did.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.172
Writing about the media,
writing about the New York elite,

30:41.256 --> 30:43.424
telling personal stories
that resonate with readers

30:43.675 --> 30:46.469
doesn't take one cent
away from covering Syria

30:46.553 --> 30:48.513
and Afghanistan and Washington.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.972
There are foreign correspondents,

30:50.057 --> 30:51.682
sports correspondents,
fashion correspondents.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.601
And an unbearable correspondent.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.479
Jealous of the New York elites?
I've got you covered.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.148
A movie star was at
an environmental fundraiser

30:59.233 --> 31:00.650
and they rode on a private jet?

31:00.734 --> 31:02.151
Here's your phony outrage.

31:02.486 --> 31:04.695
Feeling a little like you didn't make the cut?

31:04.780 --> 31:10.034
I hereby declare that amateurs are awesome
and professionals are so 20 years ago.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.995
Only instead of professionals,
I'm gonna say old media,

31:13.080 --> 31:14.539
and instead of Jim, I'm gonna say Tim

31:14.623 --> 31:17.375
because I'm Hallie Shea,
Senior Fuck You Correspondent

31:17.459 --> 31:19.794
-and I've decided to become a star.
-Are you drunk?

31:19.878 --> 31:23.005
Did you out yourself about the Boston tweet
to make sure no one suspected anyone else

31:23.090 --> 31:25.091
or did you do it to let our enemies know
you were available?

31:25.175 --> 31:26.968
Do you hear the way you're talking right now?

31:27.094 --> 31:29.178
-Our enemies?
-Did you?

31:29.263 --> 31:31.097
I'm gonna stay at my place tonight.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.433
Do you mind if I tell you something?

31:34.518 --> 31:36.352
Your problem isn't with me
and it isn't with the site.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.478
It's with the audience.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.230
You don't like that they like what they like

31:39.314 --> 31:41.399
because you need them to like you,
and that's no different...

31:41.483 --> 31:43.401
I don't give a shit about me or liking me

31:43.485 --> 31:45.611
or following me or friending me or trending.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.573
It's just ugly.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.491
I think you're threatened by technology.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.201
I beam a signal into outer space every night.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.704
I'm not scared of your Samsung Galaxy.
What else you got?

31:54.788 --> 31:57.290
I want to be part of the digital revolution.
I want to be part of...

31:57.374 --> 32:00.585
Oh, my God!
I am not talking about the apparatus!

32:04.172 --> 32:07.508
Just tell me you know I'm right.
Please. Please.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.676
At least tell me that.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.680
Tell me when you knock away
the digital revolution bullshit...

32:12.764 --> 32:15.182
"We're not beholden to corporate masters."

32:15.267 --> 32:17.351
Yeah, or any standard of good taste.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.980
Tell me, please, that you know all you did
was have a fight with your boyfriend

32:21.064 --> 32:22.356
and litigate it in public.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.692
Because I have spent time
with hardcore drug movers,

32:24.776 --> 32:27.361
and they don't pretend
they're selling medicine.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.291
Yeah, I'm drunk.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.169
-I'm gonna miss you.
-You're gonna miss a lot of things, Jim.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.691
-Yeah?
-If he sentences you, where do you go?

33:46.775 --> 33:48.818
Nowhere. He's not gonna find me in contempt.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.903
-But if he does?
-Manhattan Correctional Center.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.363
That's a real jail.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.615
And you've been shot at
and you've been stabbed.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.743
It's 1:30.

33:57.828 --> 33:59.286
I think that's your phone.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.048
We need a table or a dresser

34:11.133 --> 34:12.883
where I can put my phone.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.177
Also, walls and electricity.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.887
Hello.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.973
Is it Rebecca? Is it Charlie?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.891
It wouldn't be Charlie.
It'd be Rebecca. Is it work?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.935
It would've been my phone
if it was work. Is it Rebecca?

34:23.019 --> 34:24.061
Hang on.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.108
Yeah?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.319
Okay.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.531
No court tomorrow.
The hearing's been moved to Friday.

34:35.615 --> 34:38.242
Cedarman wants Lasenthal
and Rebecca to work on a deal.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.412
Does he know there won't be a deal
that involves not airing the story?

34:41.496 --> 34:44.665
What he knows is he doesn't want to be
the judge who locked up a news anchor.

34:47.669 --> 34:49.587
I find your Irish stoicism...

34:49.671 --> 34:51.547
-Sexy?
-Irritating.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.178
Thank you.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.054
He's out.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.849
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

35:01.933 --> 35:04.018
Everybody, the whole family.
Everybody's out.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.187
Here we go, tonight.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.647
Show me a rough sketch to time by 3:00.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.899
Good job, everybody.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.817
Thank you. We're not done yet.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.778
Good job, Don.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.821
Jim, you look sleepier than usual.

35:15.906 --> 35:18.616
Tess, Gary, Kendra, Martin,
Sloan, you did nothing.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.784
-Maggie...
-Mac.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.827
Jenna, your future is limitless.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.162
Reese wants to see you in his office.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.371
Now?

35:37.469 --> 35:39.261
Reese?

35:39.346 --> 35:41.597
Come on in. Close the door, please.

35:41.681 --> 35:45.726
Joseph Bartho and the
Joseph Bartho Family Singers are out.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.436
We just got the word.
They're heading to France

35:47.521 --> 35:50.397
via 14 connecting flights and a team of oxen.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.774
So we're running the story tonight.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.442
You can't. I'm sorry,

35:53.527 --> 35:54.985
you can't run it at all.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.993
-Why?
-Pruit. He signs a deal at the end of the day,

36:03.078 --> 36:04.829
and he won't if we run the story.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.960
Because of Will?

36:11.044 --> 36:13.629
Says he doesn't think there's a chance
Cedarman's gonna send him.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.089
It's not because of Will.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.175
He likes that Will's going to jail.
He wants him to broadcast from there.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.469
-I'm certain they won't allow that.
-I'm certain they won't, too.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.263
-What's the problem, Reese?
-The fines.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.765
His lawyers had to be told about the story,
and they've advised him that

36:24.850 --> 36:26.433
if the story was gathered illegally,

36:26.518 --> 36:28.769
the Justice Department can,
and probably will, impose

36:28.854 --> 36:30.604
crippling criminal fines.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.281
-This is horseshit.
-I know.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.158
The source risked everything.

36:44.244 --> 36:46.704
Neal's hiding in South America.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.497
Will is facing a grand jury.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.124
Bartho and his family fled the country.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.625
-And it was for nothing?
-Mac.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.878
It was for nothing?

36:53.962 --> 36:55.045
Yeah.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.425
Selling the company is the only way
you get to live to fight another day.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.719
Do we ever get to win one?

37:05.974 --> 37:07.433
I've got to go and tell the staff.

37:07.517 --> 37:11.729
Hey, Mac. You know,
the fight with the grand jury isn't over.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.898
-They still want his source.
-I know.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.734
Since the day you got here,
Will's been having a battle with himself.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.320
Is he a real journalist or just good on TV?

37:19.404 --> 37:20.988
You ever think he might be
doing this for you?

37:22.157 --> 37:25.451
Because I don't think there's not a chance
he's gonna be sent to jail.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.161
I've got his ring on my finger.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.788
He's not doing this to win my approval.

37:30.123 --> 37:33.208
Then it would be the first thing
I've seen him do that wasn't.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.383
I'm going to tell the staff.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.427
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.757
Can I make a suggestion which,
if you think about it,

38:21.841 --> 38:23.342
makes a lot of sense?

38:24.552 --> 38:25.970
Don't say anything.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.347
Have Rebecca go to Lasenthal
and say we're willing to kill the story

38:28.431 --> 38:29.974
in exchange for everybody's off the hook.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.310
Do you think there's a chance
Will would let Rebecca utter those words?

38:33.395 --> 38:35.479
- No.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.902
Let's pack the documents up in cartons

38:41.987 --> 38:43.278
and label everything.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.156
Yep.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.785
Who's the most responsible
reporter you can name?

38:49.869 --> 38:51.620
-You.
-Thank you.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.998
Who doesn't work here.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.208
Maybe someone who could use a break.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.919
Responsible how?

39:05.427 --> 39:07.261
There is an old teacher
of mine from Columbia.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.055
She mostly gets garbage assignments now
'cause she's in her 70s.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.598
Write her name down.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.443
I just heard. Sorry, Bubba.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.863
Good afternoon.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.536
I'll tell you, Mr. Geary, this isn't the best time.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.830
-You two are a couple.
-We're not,

39:34.914 --> 39:35.956
but maybe we can do this later.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.041
No, you are.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.209
I have a signed letter declaring that you are.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.296
It was sitting in my office
in a pile of things I hadn't gotten to yet.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.423
-Somebody ratted us out?
-Yes.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.799
Nobody around here would drop a dime.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.926
-You're blowing smoke. Who cheesed?
-Okay, Mugsy.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.219
-You did.
-Huh?

39:49.304 --> 39:51.930
-You did.
-Which one of us are you talking to?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.682
-I think you know.
-What's he talking about?

39:53.767 --> 39:56.977
Sloan wrote a letter to HR
declaring the two of you a couple.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.980
Yeah, it was after you made $125
on the Chipotle trade I tipped you off to.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.231
We spent the last two weeks

40:01.316 --> 40:02.691
trying to conceal
from this man that we're dating,

40:02.776 --> 40:03.734
and the whole time you knew

40:03.818 --> 40:05.402
you'd sent him a letter
saying we were dating?

40:05.487 --> 40:06.487
-Mmm-hmm.
-Why?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.155
Well, obviously I was hoping
he'd never find out.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.823
But you knew he was gonna
read the letter eventually.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.201
Eventually is a wonderful time of day.

40:12.285 --> 40:13.577
This was a
cross-that-bridge-when-we-get-to-it

40:13.661 --> 40:14.995
situation for me.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.247
-And here we are. We're at the bridge.
-Wyatt...

40:17.332 --> 40:19.166
Is lying to corporate
something you do habitually?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.919
Don and I like to make decisions
about lying on a case-by-case basis.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.879
Maybe you've helped enough.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.381
Please, don't transfer one of us.

40:26.508 --> 40:29.051
We don't work together enough,
but the little we do works.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.220
And if you ask Sloan to choose
between me and her job,

40:31.304 --> 40:33.972
you wouldn't be able to get
that sentence out before she said her job,

40:34.057 --> 40:36.433
and I really like her
and I'm trying to be good enough.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.268
And this here is the best thing that I do.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.770
And can I say one more thing?

40:39.854 --> 40:42.606
It's just occurred to me that your company
is only going to own my network

40:42.690 --> 40:43.774
until the end of the day,

40:43.858 --> 40:46.193
so what the hell has this all been about?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.904
-Come to think of it...
-I'm blown away you let me do it this long.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.197
Why did you do it this long?

40:51.658 --> 40:52.699
Fun.

40:53.493 --> 40:54.660
I work in HR.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.704
Our days aren't scored
<i>by the Hallelujah Chorus.</i>

40:59.374 --> 41:03.210
I don't know anything
about the story you were all working on,

41:03.503 --> 41:05.254
but I know enough to say sorry.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.091
Good luck to the two of you.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.300
I'm a big fan.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.638
Put those Instagram photos back.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.932
-Yes, sir.
-Why haven't we heard anything yet?

41:17.016 --> 41:19.560
-The board's still meeting.
-Pruit just walked into the building.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.687
-He's an hour early.
-Yeah.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.147
What are you guys talking about?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.733
The Bloomberg terminal will tell us
everything we need to know.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.905
Bloomberg terminal, tell us what's going on
with Toni Dodd's board meeting.

41:32.282 --> 41:33.365
It's not a Ouija board.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.826
I wasn't... I was just, you know, praying.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.411
-What are you two...
-Hang on.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.955
Their press rep just tweeted,

41:40.039 --> 41:44.126
"Exciting announcement about
major media acquisition coming at 5:00 p.m."

41:44.210 --> 41:45.252
Go. Tell Reese.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.173
-So what's going on?
-We found a white knight.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.008
Antoinette Dodd's gonna buy ACN.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.634
-Are you kidding?
-Hang on.

41:52.719 --> 41:53.886
-No, seriously.
-Hang on.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.054
How did you do that?

41:56.139 --> 41:57.431
-Shit.
-What?

41:57.515 --> 41:58.765
This can't be happening.

41:58.850 --> 41:59.975
I don't know what you're looking at.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.935
Options on Halifax just started trading up.

42:02.103 --> 42:05.105
-The Halifax Group.
-Halifax Group options...

42:05.940 --> 42:07.191
Fuck!

42:07.275 --> 42:09.026
She's buying Halifax.

42:09.110 --> 42:10.611
She met... I don't believe this.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.362
She met with us.
She wanted them to think that...

42:12.447 --> 42:13.530
We were leverage.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.576
God damn it!

42:19.746 --> 42:21.788
There's no need for airports.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.790
Just runways and a fence.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.834
That's a hell of a plan, Lucas.

42:25.919 --> 42:27.044
Dude, I told you in college

42:27.128 --> 42:29.213
that one day I was gonna buy
a company out from under you.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.881
I gave you, like, 15 years' warning.

42:30.965 --> 42:34.384
I remember you telling me
you were sleeping with my girlfriend,

42:34.469 --> 42:35.636
but not the second thing.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.804
You were probably
in shock from the first thing.

42:37.889 --> 42:42.017
Call it off! You don't have to
sell us to this pretentious ponce.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.228
Toni Dodd just got out of her board meeting,

42:44.312 --> 42:46.230
and she's gonna make a competitive offer.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.273
So fuck you and fuck you again,

42:48.358 --> 42:50.150
you fiber-optic yak!

42:50.610 --> 42:52.819
Charlie. Charlie.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.242
What Sloan's telling Charlie
is that people are buying Halifax

42:58.326 --> 43:01.036
at the current stock price
with an expiration on the assumption

43:01.120 --> 43:02.746
that Toni's about to announce she's buying it.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.581
It was leverage, Charlie.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.541
She wanted people to think
she was looking at ACN.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.377
That's why she had you guys
eat at that sushi place.

43:08.461 --> 43:10.337
She knew there was a Halifax
board member there.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.256
-You're gonna love me, Charlie.
-No, I'm not.

43:12.340 --> 43:13.840
Yeah, you are.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.301
I'm gonna take you into the 21 st century

43:16.386 --> 43:18.637
right after I drag you through
the 19th and 20th.

43:19.347 --> 43:20.555
You couldn't have gotten here
10 seconds sooner?

43:20.640 --> 43:21.598
I just saw it.

43:21.683 --> 43:22.683
What's the point of having

43:22.767 --> 43:24.309
-a Bloomberg terminal...
-It's not the terminal's fault.

43:24.394 --> 43:25.435
You want a ceremonial pen?

43:25.520 --> 43:27.521
It can write in a zero-gravity environment.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.274
Yeah, I plan to take a trip
through the ionosphere.

43:30.358 --> 43:33.026
Keep that sense of humor.
You're very entertaining.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.112
-No, whoa. Come on.
-Whoa, whoa!

43:35.488 --> 43:37.197
We're sworn enemies now, he and I.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.699
He can still hear you.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.662
-Did you see Charlie?
-After the show.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.706
He was cleaning his 12-gauge
with Maker's Mark

43:45.790 --> 43:47.541
and muttering, "Kill the wabbit."

43:52.171 --> 43:54.506
It's not Irish stoicism, is it?

43:56.592 --> 44:00.470
This is some kind of internal baptism for you,

44:00.555 --> 44:04.391
which would be heartbreaking enough,
except I think maybe it's a little for me.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.979
Don't you know that anything
that can be proven by courage and character,

44:09.063 --> 44:10.772
you proved to me a long time ago?

44:10.857 --> 44:12.316
You want me to give up the source?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.151
I just want you to say you're scared.

44:14.235 --> 44:15.986
All right, here's the thing, MacKenzie.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.613
'Cause I love you, but you've had me
on your couch for three years,

44:18.698 --> 44:20.741
and this one time we're switching places.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.534
You're tearing yourself up

44:22.618 --> 44:25.037
because you either
prioritize the story over me,

44:25.121 --> 44:26.621
which you think makes you a bad person,

44:26.706 --> 44:28.206
or you prioritize me over the story,

44:28.291 --> 44:29.833
which you think makes you a bad reporter.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.669
Either way, you're wrong.
The source came to Neal,

44:32.754 --> 44:34.921
and then I asked Neal for his name, and then...

44:35.006 --> 44:37.424
-You can stop saying "his."
-What do you mean?

44:37.508 --> 44:39.092
His name. The source is a woman.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.179
I've spoken to her in person twice.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.847
I know just as much about her as you do.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.641
Why are you standing
in front of a judge and not me?

44:46.768 --> 44:48.185
Oh, God.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.481
You can't ever repeat what you just said.

44:57.445 --> 45:00.947
<i>Mr. McAvoy refused to comply</i>
<i>with an order of this court.</i>

45:01.449 --> 45:04.284
Title 28, Section 1826

45:04.369 --> 45:06.536
of the United States Code directs this court

45:06.621 --> 45:08.955
to hold a grand jury witness in contempt

45:09.040 --> 45:13.085
if he refuses the order
and does so without just cause.

45:13.169 --> 45:17.214
We're here today to determine
if the witness can show just cause.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.841
Miss Halliday,
I'll hear argument for the witness.

45:19.926 --> 45:22.594
Thank you, Your Honor,
and may it please the court.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.889
Mr. McAvoy's cause exists
because he is protected

45:25.973 --> 45:28.433
by a reporter's privilege
to withhold information,

45:28.518 --> 45:32.104
a privilege that's been recognized
by a wide range of courts.

45:45.326 --> 45:47.702
If we were to apply that test here,

45:47.787 --> 45:50.372
we would find that the information given
by the reporter's source

45:50.456 --> 45:51.915
poses no harm to the public,

45:51.999 --> 45:54.918
and we would weigh that
against the newsworthiness

45:55.002 --> 45:58.755
of the US government swift-boating
a foreign election with disinformation

45:58.840 --> 46:02.050
that got 38 people,
including three Americans, killed.

46:03.928 --> 46:08.098
No one disputes that this is
a tragic story of unintended consequences.

46:08.182 --> 46:11.893
No one intended for anyone to die
and no one did anything illegal.

46:11.978 --> 46:15.147
Our intelligence professionals
engage in covert operations

46:15.231 --> 46:16.773
all over the world to keep us safe.

46:16.858 --> 46:18.066
It's their job.

46:18.359 --> 46:21.153
It's how we won World War ll.
It's how we won the Cold War.

46:21.237 --> 46:22.696
It's how the Berlin Wall fell,

46:22.780 --> 46:25.866
and it's why more buildings
didn't fall on September 12th.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.784
But not only can't they do their jobs

46:27.869 --> 46:31.163
if their identities are revealed
by a rogue government worker,

46:31.289 --> 46:33.540
their lives and the lives of their families

46:33.624 --> 46:37.252
will be put at great risk immediately,
and perhaps without even their knowledge.

46:37.336 --> 46:40.380
Judge, when they do their jobs recklessly,
the public has a right to know.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.133
And how does someone who isn't
an experienced professional

46:43.217 --> 46:44.509
in the clandestine services

46:44.594 --> 46:47.596
presume to know when one
of our agents is doing their job well?

46:47.680 --> 46:50.974
In this case,
we can put a stethoscope on the 38 bodies.

46:51.058 --> 46:54.603
The court is sufficiently convinced
of the news value of this story.

46:54.687 --> 46:57.564
Mr. Lasenthal,
please speak to any harm it poses.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.650
Judge, someone with a high level
of security clearance

47:00.735 --> 47:02.444
has committed an act of espionage.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.029
That fact is not in dispute.

47:04.113 --> 47:06.031
This person is still inside the government,

47:06.115 --> 47:08.742
still has access to classified materials.

47:08.826 --> 47:10.494
This person must be apprehended.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.496
Law enforcement doesn't know the identity.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.039
Mr. McAvoy does.

47:14.123 --> 47:15.207
And I can't imagine

47:15.291 --> 47:17.334
what other argument the court needs to hear.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.087
Mr. McAvoy.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.299
What do you want me to do?

47:27.345 --> 47:30.805
Your Honor, if you're leaving it up to me,
I'd just as soon go home.

47:33.559 --> 47:34.643
It's funny, but the first time

47:34.727 --> 47:36.937
the Supreme Court ever supported
a claim of protection

47:37.021 --> 47:40.065
under the First Amendment wasn't until 1919.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.526
The amendment says
Congress shall make no law

47:42.610 --> 47:44.986
abridging freedom of speech or of the press.

47:45.071 --> 47:47.364
And we went 125 years

47:47.448 --> 47:50.575
without that law protecting
critical expression.

47:50.660 --> 47:53.703
The legislation that sparked the dissent?

47:53.788 --> 47:55.205
The Espionage Act.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.459
I just thought that was interesting.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.881
I appreciate the defense
my attorney mounted,

48:04.966 --> 48:07.133
but my heart is with the Prosecutor.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.718
I'm sorry, Rebecca, it just is.

48:08.803 --> 48:13.056
It didn't used to be that so much damage
could be done by so few people.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.224
It just used to be harder.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.392
It took more manpower.

48:15.476 --> 48:18.228
So, for me, I don't like the cost benefit.

48:18.646 --> 48:21.648
But I can't give you the name of my source.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.526
I'm just not allowed to, Your Honor.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.945
It's as simple as that. I'm not allowed to.

48:28.114 --> 48:29.489
And as Your Honor well knows,

48:29.615 --> 48:33.493
prison time in a civil contempt case
can't be punitive, only coercive.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.412
So with that in mind,

48:35.496 --> 48:37.247
I'm telling the government and the court

48:37.331 --> 48:39.583
that there are no number of prison days

48:39.667 --> 48:42.752
after which I will reveal my source's identity.

48:48.342 --> 48:52.012
Well, I hate to say this,
but we're just going to have to find out.

48:52.138 --> 48:55.265
Mr. McAvoy, I find you in contempt of court

48:55.349 --> 48:59.394
and order you to surrender yourself
to the US Marshals in this building

48:59.478 --> 49:01.813
on this day at 5:00 p.m.

49:01.897 --> 49:03.398
- Yes, sir.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.123
Hey, you know this is bullshit.

49:23.336 --> 49:24.586
I don't think you should wait for me.

49:24.670 --> 49:26.212
I think you should forget about me
and move on.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.214
-Okay.
-Listen, remember,

49:28.299 --> 49:31.301
only my conversations
with my lawyer are privileged.

49:31.385 --> 49:33.178
Right? What we were
talking about last night...

49:33.262 --> 49:35.847
-Yeah, or your wife.
-Yeah, but you wanted to be a June bride...

49:35.931 --> 49:37.849
I don't anymore. I want to get married now.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.392
I think you should have thought about that...

49:39.477 --> 49:40.894
Wait. Are you serious?

49:40.978 --> 49:42.479
I'm more than serious.

49:42.563 --> 49:45.565
We get a waiver from the Mayor's Office
and use the chapel at City Hall.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.901
Honey, we've got 300 people
coming to a wedding

49:47.985 --> 49:49.861
you've been planning for 25 years.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.364
Remember the seven weeks
I spent picking the invitations?

49:52.448 --> 49:53.531
I really do.

49:54.825 --> 49:55.867
Done.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.077
- "I'm marrying Will today...

49:57.161 --> 49:58.870
"...at 3:30 p.m. at City Hall"

49:58.954 --> 50:00.705
"if you guys want to come."

50:00.790 --> 50:02.832
-Congratulations!
-Finally!

50:02.917 --> 50:05.168
That... That's what I was begging...

50:05.252 --> 50:06.961
For seven weeks we were looking...

50:07.046 --> 50:09.381
Different cardboard... Okay.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.633
For that little stunt,
I'm gonna marry your ass off.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.678
Charlie, Don, Gary, Jim,
Martin, we're putting on a wedding.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.805
-This is men's work.
-All right.

50:16.931 --> 50:19.724
-Let's go. City Hall, here we come.
-You finally grew a brain.

52:49.625 --> 52:52.710
-I saw on the news.
-Thanks for seeing me, Phil.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.379
You want to spend
your last hours of freedom

52:54.463 --> 52:56.673
arguing with me about
something that's 2,000 years old?

52:56.757 --> 52:59.467
No, we can do that another time.
I wanted to ask a favor.

52:59.552 --> 53:02.387
Mac and I have moved our wedding up
from June to this afternoon.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.181
MacKenzie, while not being
as religious as, say, you are,

53:05.266 --> 53:08.184
-she's not a full-on whack job or anything...
-Yeah.

53:08.269 --> 53:11.521
...is devout and a Catholic service
would mean a lot to her.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.648
I can do that. Where are you being married?

53:13.732 --> 53:15.149
At the chapel at City Hall.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.862
Catholic service has to be
performed in a Catholic church.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.573
Doesn't that sound like one of those rules
we've talked about?

53:21.657 --> 53:22.949
God's omniscient,

53:23.033 --> 53:25.368
but He's only willing to work
in certain buildings?

53:25.452 --> 53:27.620
-That's not...
-Like it's a union thing.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.248
Fine.

53:30.332 --> 53:33.126
Thank you. I'll have a car waiting at 3:15.

53:37.631 --> 53:39.215
Will.

53:39.300 --> 53:40.466
You want to pray with me?

54:14.835 --> 54:17.003
You have to make a grand apology to her.

54:17.087 --> 54:19.088
-Really grand.
-I know.

54:19.173 --> 54:21.257
-Canyon grand.
-I know.

54:22.509 --> 54:24.469
-Where's Professor Ethics?
-We had a fight.

54:25.471 --> 54:26.971
About what?

54:28.223 --> 54:29.432
Nothing.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.695
Rejoice with those who rejoice.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.864
Weep with those who weep.

54:45.699 --> 54:47.992
Have the same regard for one another.

54:48.077 --> 54:51.329
Do not be haughty,
but associate with the lowly.

54:51.413 --> 54:53.790
<i>Do not be wise in your own estimation.</i>

54:59.213 --> 55:01.923
<i>Do not repay anyone evil for evil.</i>

55:02.007 --> 55:04.717
<i>Be concerned for what is noble</i>
<i>in the sight of all.</i>

55:05.719 --> 55:08.304
If possible, on your part,

55:08.389 --> 55:10.348
live at peace with all.

55:10.432 --> 55:11.724
The word of the Lord.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.434
-Thanks be to God.
-Thanks be to God.

55:28.075 --> 55:31.119
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

55:31.996 --> 55:33.162
I do.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.958
Do you take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

55:38.419 --> 55:39.711
I do.
