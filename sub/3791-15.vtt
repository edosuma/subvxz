01:25.219 --> 01:26.931
Finally, I get you on the phone.

01:27.593 --> 01:29.715
Why do ages
love the 6:00 a.m. wake-up-call?

01:29.716 --> 01:31.549
Why do managers sleep on the job?

01:31.693 --> 01:33.652
<i>- What's the problem, Amanda?</i>
- The problem is,

01:33.711 --> 01:36.335
I need an answer on <i>Glimpse</i>
and you do not return my calls.

01:36.406 --> 01:37.867
We called you back on friday.

01:38.216 --> 01:40.759
You left a message
at my office at 10:00 p.m.

01:41.028 --> 01:43.161
Who'd you think was going
to answer, the janitor?

01:43.842 --> 01:45.982
- Sorry.
- You're avoiding me, I don't like it.

01:46.153 --> 01:48.262
- Listen, Amanda...
<i>- No, you listen, Eric.</i>

01:48.715 --> 01:50.300
I don't take kindly to the runaround.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.195
I demand some face time
with you and Vince

01:52.366 --> 01:54.546
this morning at 10:00 a.m.
at my office

01:58.779 --> 02:00.384
Who is she to demand anything?

02:00.715 --> 02:03.269
- Doesn't she work for you, Vince?
- Indeed, she does.

02:03.327 --> 02:06.424
And hanging up on E,
must have been prett emasculating?

02:06.443 --> 02:08.860
Felt like I was getting called
by principal Reeve's office.

02:08.898 --> 02:10.901
Just like him,
I'm gonna tell her the way it is.

02:10.902 --> 02:12.712
Please do,
'cause I don't like avoiding her.

02:12.713 --> 02:14.284
No no.
No more avoiding.

02:14.322 --> 02:16.027
We'll tell her
we're not making a move

02:16.028 --> 02:18.497
on anything until the cameras
actually roll on <i>Medellin</i>.

02:18.574 --> 02:21.214
She'll be pissed
if she thinks you take Ari seriously.

02:21.215 --> 02:22.850
Then she's gonna be pissed, huh E?

02:22.904 --> 02:24.809
Oh, now Vince is emasculating E.

02:24.947 --> 02:26.123
Get the fuck in the car.

02:29.685 --> 02:31.826
- Late again, Ari.
- What, do I work for you?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.355
No. But Rob Rubino still does.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.924
- Why?
- I'm on it.

02:36.026 --> 02:37.151
He's dead weight.

02:37.229 --> 02:40.108
He's booking 100 grand a quarter
and costing us 150.

02:40.674 --> 02:42.525
I want him gone.
Do I need to do it myself?

02:42.621 --> 02:43.643
I said I'm on it.

02:47.311 --> 02:49.907
- Protein shake and a power bar.
- Not hungry, Lloyd.

02:50.008 --> 02:52.311
The missus said
you didn't eat dinner again last night.

02:52.312 --> 02:54.112
Why do you two talk so much?

02:54.249 --> 02:56.996
- We like each other.
- Just get Rob Rubino in my office,

02:57.073 --> 02:59.214
and tell him to bring
all of his worldly possessions.

02:59.253 --> 03:01.722
Rob Rubino is off getting
his lasik surgery this morning.

03:01.761 --> 03:02.917
When he'finished then.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.657
When he's done,
you will be at couples' therapy.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.429
- No, Lloyd, no!
- Yes, Ari, yes.

03:09.562 --> 03:12.947
But I will have Rob Rubino waiting
on the firing line upon your return.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.770
This is bullshit.
It's fucking absurd.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.710
You guys told me
that you wanted to work.

03:18.819 --> 03:20.377
You told me to find a project,

03:20.647 --> 03:21.958
and I found one, a great one.

03:21.997 --> 03:24.428
that you loved
and you still won't give me an answer.

03:24.899 --> 03:26.512
We're very contemplative people

03:26.772 --> 03:28.181
Please don't give that bullshit.

03:28.835 --> 03:29.887
I don't want apologies.

03:29.964 --> 03:31.978
I want only one thing-
a fucking answer!

03:33.273 --> 03:34.712
<i>Glimpses</i> is a great project

03:34.813 --> 03:36.839
with a great director,
so what is the problem?

03:37.336 --> 03:38.476
I don't have a problem.

03:40.459 --> 03:41.637
I don't have a problem.

03:43.836 --> 03:45.223
This is about <i>Medellin</i>, isn't it?

03:47.440 --> 03:49.080
Ari is still in your fucking head.

03:49.209 --> 03:50.701
Amanda, no, he's not.

03:50.812 --> 03:52.703
Ari doesn't exist anymore, Vince.

03:52.781 --> 03:54.729
- I know.
- Neither does <i>Medellin</i>.

03:54.905 --> 03:57.741
- It's a ghost, you understand?
- Yes.

03:59.661 --> 04:00.661
I understand.

04:01.971 --> 04:03.193
Then I want an answer.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.432
And don't flash
those pretty eyes at me, Vince.

04:07.666 --> 04:08.882
I wasn't. I'm not.

04:09.159 --> 04:11.088
My eyes aren't as pretty,
but wasn't either.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.057
When can I have an answer?

04:13.096 --> 04:15.642
How about today?
Just let us read it one more time.

04:15.972 --> 04:19.015
Okay, today.
I'll be waiting.

04:22.014 --> 04:24.426
I never heard Ari
talk to Vince like that.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.419
Yeah, seriously, we could hear
the screaming right through the door.

04:27.499 --> 04:28.839
- It was kinda hot
- Hot?

04:29.158 --> 04:31.795
She bullied Vince into making
a decision he didn't wanna make.

04:31.931 --> 04:35.346
- Still hot.
- I did not get bullied. I got finessed.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.408
Call it what you want,
we got reading to do.

04:37.596 --> 04:39.806
Sucks for you guys,
'cause we go the Dodger game.

04:39.863 --> 04:43.143
- And it's bat day
- Just for that I' getting four copies,

04:43.172 --> 04:44.783
You guys can read so
Edith Wharton too.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.777
Let us know what the retards
of America think.

04:47.486 --> 04:50.804
You guys don't really wanna go
to the game without us, do you?

04:52.095 --> 04:54.528
- It's bat day, Vince.
- Come on, keep me company.

04:55.134 --> 04:56.600
It's not like
the Yanks are in town.

04:56.785 --> 04:59.562
- Or the Mets.
- The Mets? Who care about the Mets?

05:00.283 --> 05:02.139
So do you feel depressed, Ari?

05:03.049 --> 05:05.191
Depressed, no;
irritated, yes.

05:05.747 --> 05:07.271
He hasn't had a full meal in a week,

05:07.409 --> 05:09.658
and he slept past 7:00
again this morning.

05:09.725 --> 05:13.063
I haven't seen him sleep past 5:30
since 1993.

05:13.532 --> 05:15.727
So do you think
losing this Vincent Chase

05:15.785 --> 05:17.058
is really the problem, Ari?

05:17.409 --> 05:18.409
- No.
- Yes.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.228
What do you think the problem is then?

05:21.284 --> 05:22.600
I don't think there is a proem.

05:22.721 --> 05:24.957
Ask him why he didn't go
to the Lakers game last night.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.513
Who said I wanted to go to the game?

05:26.609 --> 05:29.040
You asked five times
if you should have gone.

05:29.098 --> 05:31.026
And five fucking times
you didn't answer me.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.585
"If you wanted to go,
you should have gone," is not an answer.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.650
- Is that an answer?
- Did you wanna go, Ari?

05:35.784 --> 05:37.597
He did but didn't go because he thought

05:37.775 --> 05:40.225
- he might run into Vince again.
- Ridiculous.

05:40.348 --> 05:43.348
- Is it ridiculous?
- What are you two, a fucking tag team?

05:43.408 --> 05:46.611
I don't think that Vincent Chase
should determine

05:47.040 --> 05:49.085
where you go
and don't go in this town.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.499
- He doesn't determine
- He's been in funk since he got fired.

05:53.011 --> 05:55.601
And then of course
there was the birthday-party incident--

05:55.722 --> 05:57.302
Everybody stop.

05:57.365 --> 06:00.433
I didn't go to the Lakers game 'cause
they were playing the fucking bobcats.

06:00.452 --> 06:03.220
And I came here today
because I thought this was a session

06:03.341 --> 06:06.186
on how my wife
could learn to communicate,

06:06.345 --> 06:08.744
how to answer a question
without a question.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.646
Basic humanity 101.

06:10.815 --> 06:13.470
Which I though
given your wall of fucking diplomas,

06:13.606 --> 06:15.748
you could easily fix.
Or if you couldn't,

06:15.877 --> 06:19.562
you could give her a pill that could
either fix it or make her a mute.

06:19.785 --> 06:22.466
But now, to turn around
and gang up on me?

06:22.601 --> 06:25.727
I have work to do.
I have hundred of clients to deal with.

06:25.948 --> 06:29.498
And just so we're clear...
I don't care about any of 'em.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.212
they're all just a number.

06:31.392 --> 06:34.247
Like wife number one,
and therapist number seven.

06:34.504 --> 06:35.507
Good day.

06:42.910 --> 06:44.448
You're really only our fifth.

06:46.624 --> 06:48.727
One for you, one for you,

06:49.449 --> 06:50.528
and one for you.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.110
This is a long script, E.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.070
There's a reason I'm in tv now...

06:55.132 --> 06:56.830
No more than 60 pages at a clip.

06:57.004 --> 06:59.647
Maybe we should break it
into four quarrs. It'll be faster.

06:59.696 --> 07:02.573
Just read it. I like that E's
including everyone in the process.

07:02.636 --> 07:05.376
We gotta process this quickly.
We got four hours to decide.

07:05.407 --> 07:06.383
On it, boss.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.784
I'm going back down, read in peace.
I'll be back in an hour.

07:08.810 --> 07:09.947
He's strict.

07:10.261 --> 07:13.095
Yeah, now you got a strict agent
and a strict manager.

07:13.442 --> 07:16.123
- Enjoy that.
- Yeah, but I'm still in charge.

07:24.697 --> 07:26.642
One more dip before we dive in then?

07:27.197 --> 07:28.197
Definitely.

07:32.237 --> 07:34.590
- Are you coming back?
- I am back, Lloyd.

07:34.635 --> 07:37.092
I'm getting on the elevator now.
Why, did you miss me?

07:37.197 --> 07:38.862
No... I mean, yes.
I do miss you,

07:38.946 --> 07:40.334
but that's not why I'm calling.

07:40.571 --> 07:43.111
Barbara had me place
Rob Rubino in your office.

07:43.929 --> 07:45.945
She just loves the smell of blood,
doesn't she?

07:45.946 --> 07:47.994
- What did you tell him?
- Very little.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.905
You know this sort of unpleasantness
makes me uncomrtable.

07:51.010 --> 07:54.622
Each time you do it, it gets a little
bit easier, Lloyd. I'm coming right up.

07:55.973 --> 07:56.995
Ruthless.

07:59.698 --> 08:01.278
- Ari.
- On it.

08:01.319 --> 08:02.327
- When?
- Right now,

08:02.346 --> 08:03.715
but I kno you like to watch, Babs,

08:03.754 --> 08:05.490
so come on in if you want a thrill.

08:06.884 --> 08:09.290
- Hey, Rob.
- Hey, there he is.

08:13.528 --> 08:16.083
That's right, you had your
little eye procedure today.

08:16.104 --> 08:18.110
It's actually not a procedure
i's a real surgery.

08:18.149 --> 08:21.282
They actually cut into my eyeball
and then they lift the cornea.

08:21.636 --> 08:23.358
It's still ective, though, righ

08:25.520 --> 08:27.835
- Rob, listen...
- Ari, I know why I'm here.

08:28.489 --> 08:30.997
Oh, you do?
That'll make it easier.

08:32.035 --> 08:33.289
We go back a long way.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.732
- Yeah, we do.
- I mean, the Morris mailroom.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.361
Remember the handshake, huh?

08:38.427 --> 08:39.448
Here's the "W."

08:40.510 --> 08:42.943
- Come on, Ari, gimme the "M."
- I'm sorry, Rob.

08:44.033 --> 08:46.440
Ari, Carrie left me.

08:48.220 --> 08:49.993
She did? When?

08:51.442 --> 08:52.621
About three months ago.

08:53.468 --> 08:54.634
I haven't told anybody.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.689
But that's why my work has been off.

08:56.938 --> 08:59.906
Look, Ari, just try to understand
what I'm dealing with here.

09:00.472 --> 09:03.135
When she left
I felt like somebody

09:03.220 --> 09:05.839
had pulled the rug from under me.
When I met her she had nothing.

09:05.909 --> 09:08.346
Then she designs this pair
of terrycloth sweatpants,

09:08.347 --> 09:11.347
she puts a "j" on the ass
and she's worth $50 million.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.279
And now she's fucking the guy
from the chili peppers.

09:15.470 --> 09:17.882
It just...
it hurts so much inside

09:19.094 --> 09:20.465
Don't fucking cry, Rob.

09:20.764 --> 09:21.785
I can't cry, Ari.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.978
My tear ducts will be
permanently fucked if I do.

09:25.248 --> 09:26.791
Jesus Christ.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.510
Do you have any idea what it's like
to lose somebody you really love, Ari?

09:30.595 --> 09:33.445
- Fuck, fuck!
- Don't hit me, please don't hit me.

09:34.659 --> 09:35.881
Get back to your desk.

09:37.158 --> 09:38.158
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.257
- Thank you.
- And do better.

09:40.334 --> 09:43.299
I'm gonna do better, I promise.
I'm gonna make you proud. Thank you.

09:45.576 --> 09:46.695
Thank you.

09:47.719 --> 09:49.634
Where is my fucking assistant?

09:49.711 --> 09:50.850
Righ here, Mr. Rubino.

09:58.094 --> 09:59.649
What the fuck was that, Ari?

09:59.720 --> 10:02.039
A shot at redemption, Babs,
you ever hear of it?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.735
Not when I'm payin for the sins.

10:04.011 --> 10:05.940
You were supposed to fire him,

10:06.240 --> 10:08.594
not become
his seeing-fucking-eye dog.

10:08.721 --> 10:12.032
Partnership agreement states that
we both have to agree on a dismissal.

10:12.151 --> 10:13.096
I don't agree.

10:14.218 --> 10:16.023
What the fuck is going on with you, Ari?

10:16.094 --> 10:17.094
Nothing.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.219
You're not you.

10:21.159 --> 10:22.825
You're soft and weak and nice.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.717
It's disgusting.

10:25.007 --> 10:27.939
You really want the word to spread
around tow that you're a pussy?

10:32.438 --> 10:33.499
Are you crying?

10:33.538 --> 10:35.679
Yeah, I'm fucking crying.
Get outta here, Babs.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.628
Get the fuck outta here.
Get out of here.

10:40.158 --> 10:42.365
Lloyd, get Dr. Marcus on the phone.

10:42.597 --> 10:44.061
Tell her it's an emergency.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.668
You gotta be shittin' me.

10:58.646 --> 10:59.646
Morning, E.

11:02.004 --> 11:03.267
I thought you loved the script.

11:03.268 --> 11:05.840
Sometime things don't hold up
on a second reading.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.560
I didn't get it at all.
Why doesn't Vince bang the girl?

11:08.657 --> 11:10.355
'Cause that's the way it was back then.

11:10.457 --> 11:13.288
What are you saying, E?
Guys didn't get pussy back in the day?

11:13.404 --> 11:15.391
Don't be retarded, Turtle.
Of course they did,

11:15.643 --> 11:16.884
or none of us would be here.

11:16.961 --> 11:19.970
- Did you like it, Johnny?
- Couldn't get past page eight, bro.

11:20.009 --> 11:21.702
What did you like
about it the first time?

11:21.723 --> 11:22.861
I liked that Amanda liked it.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.207
- What did you like about it?
- I liked that you liked it.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.733
- I didn't really like it.
- Neither.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.081
- It was boring, right
- Totally, but you wer so excited.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.248
That's 'cause Amanda was excited.
She got me excited.

11:31.287 --> 11:34.083
- She knows how to sell.
- I'd buy diseased fish from her.

11:34.457 --> 11:36.386
- I'd eat it.
- So it's a pass then.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.720
- What you gonna tell her?
- What are we gonna tell her?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.607
You told her 
you liked it in the first place.

11:40.645 --> 11:43.173
No, that's your job manager
you're bad cop, always.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.372
Yeah, manager,
stop being such a puss.

11:45.458 --> 11:46.893
Or at least let me be bad cop,

11:46.974 --> 11:49.289
'cause I would love
to interrogate Amanda.

11:51.832 --> 11:53.169
Dr. Marcus' office.

11:54.397 --> 11:55.612
No, she's not in right now.

11:58.308 --> 12:00.931
- Hi, can I help you?
- My name's Ari Gold I'm a patient here.

12:01.019 --> 12:03.587
Yes, I know,
your office has called several times.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.833
- Where's the doc?
- Dr. Marcus is out monday afternoons.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.031
She takes some
much-deserved personal time.

12:09.301 --> 12:10.729
I need to talk to her right now.

12:10.825 --> 12:12.292
- Is this an emergency
- Yeah.

12:12.831 --> 12:14.219
- Are you suicidal?
- No.

12:14.582 --> 12:17.068
- Any thoughts of suicide?
- Uh, no.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.490
Well, you look like
you've been crying.

12:20.144 --> 12:21.144
Fuck you.

12:23.059 --> 12:25.818
You can call back after 5:00
to schedule an appointment.

12:25.931 --> 12:29.326
I'm prepared to write you a check
for $5,000 if you tell me where she is.

12:31.777 --> 12:34.073
Oh, that is freaking gorgeous.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.532
You think I can get
on the celebrity tour?

12:36.648 --> 12:37.883
If you were a celebrity.

12:38.270 --> 12:40.700
My show airs in three weeks.
My time is coming.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.628
Yo, did you get her?

12:42.821 --> 12:43.895
Oh, I got her.

12:45.052 --> 12:46.054
How'd it go?

12:46.094 --> 12:48.582
Judging by the look on his face,
not well.

12:48.841 --> 12:50.597
She wants the three of us
to have dinner.

12:50.732 --> 12:52.362
You just can't close this broad?

12:52.420 --> 12:55.449
If this was Ari, you'd have told him no,
and we'd be eating a dodger dog.

12:55.495 --> 12:56.460
Kid's right.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.513
She yelled at me again.
What I was supposed to s?

12:58.551 --> 13:00.288
What would you say if Ari yelled at you?

13:00.352 --> 13:02.781
- He'd tell Ari to fuck off.
- True that.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.982
I think they're right.
You're soft on her.

13:05.322 --> 13:07.155
And you were real tough
this morning, Vince.

13:07.156 --> 13:08.757
You're both pussies, okay?

13:08.969 --> 13:11.563
And this is the problem
with having a hot-looking agent.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.467
That's the problem with hot-looking
women in the workplace in general.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.291
They should be barred,
'cause no man can say no to them.

13:17.428 --> 13:19.433
You should run for president
on that one, Drama.

13:19.434 --> 13:20.816
You can't run on the truth, E.

13:20.952 --> 13:22.099
The truth, Johnny is

13:22.157 --> 13:25.090
that tonight the boys from Queens
are gonna set a hot woman straight,

13:25.291 --> 13:26.391
for real this time.

13:26.898 --> 13:28.989
Can't send boys to do men's work.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.717
But good luck to you, both of you.

13:34.932 --> 13:37.534
If I birdie this hole
I get to blow your husband, Jane.

13:38.116 --> 13:39.982
If he's okay with it, so am I.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.492
Well, this guy's
get his head up his ass.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.063
Hold on,
I just need a word.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.900
Ari, what are you doing here?

13:52.616 --> 13:54.733
- I need a sec, doc.
- Jesus.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.910
- Come, for one-- I need you.
- No, not now.

13:56.948 --> 13:58.434
- I need you, doc, please.
- Ari...

14:02.805 --> 14:03.805
I would blow him.

14:04.679 --> 14:05.986
This is personal time, Ari.

14:06.063 --> 14:08.489
I have a rule not to have
my personal time interrupted.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.651
Dangers of belonging
to the same club as patients.

14:10.689 --> 14:12.305
This is completely inappropriate.

14:12.407 --> 14:14.355
Doc, I am melting down.

14:15.928 --> 14:18.387
Okay. I'll give you five minutes.

14:22.803 --> 14:24.840
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'm not me.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.494
My wife is right.
It is about Vince.

14:28.181 --> 14:32.044
Ari, even in a professional relaonship
where there no sexual component,

14:32.179 --> 14:34.313
there's a sense of loss
after a breakup.

14:34.682 --> 14:36.086
A period of mourning, if you will.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.440
How long does it lt?
'cause it's affecting my work.

14:39.054 --> 14:40.054
How so?

14:40.869 --> 14:43.867
I couldn't fire someone today. Firing
people is one of my favorite thing

14:43.868 --> 14:46.089
it's a perk of my job.
I couldn't do.

14:46.304 --> 14:49.275
All because this little fuck gave me
some song about his wife leaving him.

14:49.332 --> 14:50.863
- So you felt compassion
- Yeah.

14:51.070 --> 14:53.775
Last week,
 all I had to dowas let my assistant

14:53.891 --> 14:56.990
perform just one more of the many
gay acts that he's performedn his life.

14:57.195 --> 15:00.301
It would have made me millions
of dollars. I couldn't do that either.

15:00.618 --> 15:02.645
So you felt protective
over someone else.

15:02.703 --> 15:04.285
Yeah, and it made me sick.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.516
Ari, these are good things.

15:07.913 --> 15:10.512
- Sounds like you're evolving.
- I don't wanto evolve

15:10.626 --> 15:12.999
I want to get back to me.
I like me.

15:14.323 --> 15:18.095
It will take mohs of extensive therapy,
maybe even years.

15:18.373 --> 15:20.822
for you to get comfortable
with the direction you're heading

15:20.823 --> 15:22.762
I don't want
to head in that direction, doc.

15:22.872 --> 15:25.818
I want my edge back.
I need my anger and I need it now.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.397
I'm making run at the course record.

15:29.698 --> 15:32.475
I want you to call my office,
make an appointment.

15:32.949 --> 15:35.531
Trust me,
this is exciting progress.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.669
Doc, don't leave me here--

15:38.135 --> 15:39.696
Boundaries, Ari,

15:39.951 --> 15:41.518
ad here to them please.

15:43.135 --> 15:45.308
You shitty dime-store therapist.

15:45.386 --> 15:47.222
A man's life is on the line here

15:47.412 --> 15:50.509
and all you give a fuck about
is beating some stupid club record.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.776
That will do what for you?
Give you five minutes of pleasure

15:53.815 --> 15:56.277
while you fuck your underpaid
emasculated husband tonight?

15:56.445 --> 15:58.432
How the fuck
does he afford this place anyway?

15:58.548 --> 16:00.863
Isn't he a guidance counselor
at a high school?

16:02.043 --> 16:03.509
That anger you were worried about...

16:03.567 --> 16:05.303
- Yeah?
- I think it's back.

16:06.846 --> 16:09.585
Triggers, Ari,
they can go both way.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.249
You can right now--
stop, work hard

16:13.640 --> 16:15.388
and go in a direction
to make yourself

16:15.465 --> 16:18.262
a decent positive member of society...
like my husband-

16:18.365 --> 16:20.859
or you can go back
to the lowlife narcissistic grunt

16:20.898 --> 16:23.714
I've watched berate his wife
for a year and a half in my office.

16:25.463 --> 16:27.018
I knew you were on her side.

16:27.588 --> 16:28.810
It's your choice, Ari.

16:39.104 --> 16:40.165
Sorry.

16:42.589 --> 16:43.589
He's not in there.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.170
Why would he be in his office at 3:00?
Where is he?

16:46.276 --> 16:47.276
Conference room.

16:52.496 --> 16:56.644
Okay, I believe that that is an "L."

16:56.955 --> 16:58.306
It is in fact an "L."

16:58.877 --> 17:01.460
Can you believe six hours ago
I couldn't even read a stop sign?

17:01.531 --> 17:03.808
- Test me again. I want to go smaller.
- Smaller?

17:05.026 --> 17:08.492
Great work Rob.
See if you can read this.

17:19.433 --> 17:22.513
You're fired!
And in case your ears are fucked,

17:22.862 --> 17:25.060
Get the fuck out!

17:25.651 --> 17:28.272
And the next person I see,
juggling

17:28.564 --> 17:30.802
tap-dancing
or baton twirling

17:30.964 --> 17:33.009
or doing any other circus-like tricks

17:33.251 --> 17:35.199
will join him, all right?

17:35.833 --> 17:37.646
One-strike policy applies.

17:37.838 --> 17:39.096
Now get back to work.

17:40.365 --> 17:41.811
God damn, that felt good

17:45.714 --> 17:47.965
- What happened to you?
- Shock therapy, Babs.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.027
Skip it, Genny.

17:54.672 --> 17:56.780
We think it's a great script, Amanda,
we really do.

17:56.819 --> 17:59.385
- It's a great script.
- It's just not a great one for Vince.

17:59.424 --> 18:02.274
- It's just really for me.
- I can't picture Vince on horse.

18:02.275 --> 18:04.689
And the British accent?
Not feeling it.

18:05.082 --> 18:07.648
- Please don't get mad.
- Don't get mad. You understand, right?

18:07.686 --> 18:09.775
I don't understand.
Three weeks ago it was for you.

18:09.776 --> 18:12.752
Three weeks ago I didn't hear any
problems whit the horse or the accent.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.723
What's changed besides the
appearance of Ari's receding hair line?

18:15.743 --> 18:18.791
- It's not Ari.
- It's really not Ari, Amanda, I swear.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.908
Vince, I have never
gotten angry at a client

18:21.966 --> 18:23.714
because he told me
he didn't like a script.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.893
Why I am getting angry now...
I'm sorry...

18:25.931 --> 18:27.552
Why I'm getting frustrated now

18:27.840 --> 18:30.275
is because my client
told me that he loved it,

18:30.476 --> 18:32.405
had me set in motion
plans to put him in it

18:32.461 --> 18:34.264
and then pulled back at the last second.

18:34.525 --> 18:37.020
So if not Ari, then why?
Why did you tell me you love it?

18:37.838 --> 18:39.726
It's because you loved it so much.

18:41.368 --> 18:43.461
And because you were so passionate
when you sold it.

18:45.276 --> 18:47.252
And because
I didn't want to disappoint you.

18:48.278 --> 18:50.778
Vince, you're gonna
have to be honest with me

18:50.837 --> 18:53.420
- if we're gon be able to work together.
- I agree completely

18:53.539 --> 18:55.761
but sometimes
it's not so easy to say no to you.

18:55.780 --> 18:59.021
- Why, you think I'm not gonna listen?
- No, it's because you're so cute.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.492
- I'm cute?
- Yeah, you know,

19:01.550 --> 19:03.460
when you get all excited and amped up

19:03.548 --> 19:05.632
and you furrow your brow,
you're really cute.

19:07.239 --> 19:08.239
You know?

19:12.302 --> 19:14.008
Cute.
You called her cute.

19:14.113 --> 19:17.206
- Stop rehashing.
- I couldn't believe my fucking ears.

19:17.497 --> 19:18.481
What happened?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.892
Yeah, mistress Amanda
dominate you two again?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.785
And did she wear latex?

19:23.115 --> 19:25.079
No, Vince told her
he thought she was cute.

19:25.156 --> 19:26.216
You're changing context.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.507
We're gonna changing agent
seeing that you basically

19:28.584 --> 19:30.533
put it on the table
that you want fuck her.

19:30.871 --> 19:32.396
Better than leaving it unsaid.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.772
I wanted to fuck
my old manager for years.

19:34.865 --> 19:37.271
Never told her. Made
the working environment intolerable.

19:37.362 --> 19:39.496
- For you or for her?
- This is so fucked.

19:39.592 --> 19:42.960
E, do you not think Amanda already knew
that Vince wanted to fuck her?

19:43.018 --> 19:45.642
- I didn't know he wanted to fuck her.
- Come on!

19:45.716 --> 19:48.147
- We all want to fuck her.
- She's Vince's agent.

19:48.302 --> 19:51.177
Are you telling me when she came out
this morning mouth blazing,

19:51.267 --> 19:53.602
spit flying,
power suit waving,

19:54.288 --> 19:55.638
you didn't get a little excited?

19:55.677 --> 19:57.008
I got a little excited.

19:57.146 --> 19:59.249
That's nothing to be ashamed of, Vince.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.958
All men love women filled with rage.

20:02.214 --> 20:04.075
You know what?
The bottom line is she's hot.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.248
But once you put it out there
it changes everything.

20:06.268 --> 20:07.927
For guys like us, yeah.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.385
For beautiful people like them,
whole different set of rules.

20:11.546 --> 20:13.842
- That's true.
- Maybe I should apologize.

20:14.177 --> 20:15.181
Maybe you should.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.421
You just call yourself
one of the beautiful people?

20:20.444 --> 20:22.431
Vince, do you think I'm hot?

20:24.426 --> 20:27.078
- What?
<i>- Well, you said  I'm cute, right?</i>

20:27.238 --> 20:29.906
By cute did you mean
I'm hot and you want to fuck me?

20:30.841 --> 20:33.330
I don't know exactly
how I should respond to that.

20:33.689 --> 20:36.750
<i>You had no problem telling me I'm cute
in the middle of a business meeting,</i>

20:37.437 --> 20:39.810
<i>so why don't you skip the
politeness right now and tell me?</i>

20:39.894 --> 20:41.013
Do you want to fuck me?

20:41.707 --> 20:42.634
No.

20:43.362 --> 20:44.362
No?

20:44.802 --> 20:46.246
Well, I mean, yeah.
I mean--

20:47.177 --> 20:48.774
I don't know.
Maybe.

20:49.344 --> 20:52.348
I hate sexual tension, Vince.
It always leads to confusion.

20:52.928 --> 20:54.274
I couldn't agree more.

20:54.863 --> 20:56.780
Well good.
Then let's get it out of the way.

20:58.364 --> 21:01.393
- How?
- By fucking each other's brains out

21:01.801 --> 21:03.738
<i>and never talkg about it
again so we can move on</i>

21:03.856 --> 21:07.137
to a very successful and professional
agent-client relationship.

21:07.862 --> 21:10.028
<i>- Sound good?</i>
- To me, it does, yeah.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.216
Who was that?

21:19.385 --> 21:21.096
Jewelry store girl.
She's picking me up.

21:21.135 --> 21:23.615
- I'd better gethanged.
- What do you want to do about Amanda?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.838
I'll call her first thing tomorrow,
apologize.

21:29.552 --> 21:31.212
