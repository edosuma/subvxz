16:21.395 --> 16:23.061
In the end, he couldn't
do with all the nagging

16:23.063 --> 16:27.965
so he handed himself in,
went back to the shovel.

16:27.967 --> 16:31.503
Regardless, he
served out his time.

16:31.505 --> 16:34.406

to get back in the game.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.569

17:14.046 --> 17:15.679
No, I'm walking home.

17:19.719 --> 17:22.920

this job, do you trust them?

17:22.922 --> 17:26.124
As much as they
trust me, yeah.

17:26.126 --> 17:27.358
We're gonna need
a space to work

17:27.361 --> 17:29.628
and some dust to get
the ball rolling.

17:29.630 --> 17:31.631
I've got that covered.

17:32.498 --> 17:34.366

Yeah.

17:57.090 --> 17:59.323
He won't help you.

17:59.325 --> 18:00.457
Thought you'd retired.

18:00.459 --> 18:01.629
Just listen.

18:02.696 --> 18:05.362

something's going down.

18:05.364 --> 18:06.464

18:06.466 --> 18:07.799

18:11.938 --> 18:16.110
about the next words that
pop out that mouth of yours.

18:17.843 --> 18:19.677
I might have heard something.

18:19.679 --> 18:20.911
But it's mental, you
wouldn't believe me

18:20.913 --> 18:22.112
if I told you anyway.

18:22.114 --> 18:22.949
Try me.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.650
They've got a bunch
of old timers on the go.

18:26.652 --> 18:30.388
Proper relics, we're
talking the Walking Dead.

18:30.390 --> 18:31.458
Keep going.

18:32.926 --> 18:35.959
I heard they drink
out at the Railway.

18:35.961 --> 18:37.728
Look it's bollocks.

18:37.730 --> 18:38.963
There's no way a
bunch of old timers

18:38.965 --> 18:41.968
are gonna pull off
something like that.

18:43.570 --> 18:45.573
You hear anything else

18:46.806 --> 18:48.706
you let me know.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.709
Of course.

18:51.277 --> 18:52.178
Is that it?

18:53.513 --> 18:54.948
You can go now.

18:56.248 --> 18:57.651
This is my car.

18:58.951 --> 19:01.552
And I need to
make a phone call.

19:01.554 --> 19:03.323
I won't ask you again.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.694
This is why you've
got no friends Frank.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.640
So there's this bloke,
he's out for a stroll

19:23.642 --> 19:26.176
and he's taking a walk
down a great long pier

19:26.178 --> 19:28.245
and he notices that
down at the end of it

19:28.247 --> 19:31.049
there's this woman and
she's in a wheelchair.

19:31.051 --> 19:32.449
Well as he gets a bit closer

19:32.451 --> 19:36.221
he notices she's quite
a good looking bird

19:36.223 --> 19:39.624
but she's crying her heart out.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.458
So he says to her,
"Oh come on darling

19:41.460 --> 19:42.726
"what's the matter with you?

19:42.728 --> 19:44.995
"Why are you crying?"

19:44.997 --> 19:47.898
Well she looks at
him and she says

19:47.900 --> 19:49.736
"Men don't look at me.

19:50.937 --> 19:54.906
"I'm 30 years of age and
I've never been hugged."

19:54.908 --> 19:58.976
Well now I mean, this is
breaking the blokes heart right?

19:58.978 --> 20:02.580
So he leans in and he gives
her a great big hug, yeah.

20:02.582 --> 20:04.581
And this brings a
smile to her face.

20:04.583 --> 20:08.319
But straightaway,
she's crying again.

20:08.321 --> 20:10.053
So he says to her,
"Now come on."

20:10.055 --> 20:11.755
He says, "What's
the matter with you?

20:11.757 --> 20:14.492
"What's with all these tears?"

20:14.494 --> 20:19.097
Well she looks up again with
these big, sad, beautiful eyes

20:19.099 --> 20:22.167
and she says, "It's just that

20:22.169 --> 20:25.803
"I've never been
kissed by a man."

20:25.805 --> 20:27.237
Well now look, I mean
this bloke is just out

20:27.239 --> 20:28.439
for a stroll isn't he?

20:28.441 --> 20:31.576
He's not after any
romantic assignation.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.843
But then he thinks about
it, he looks around.

20:32.845 --> 20:35.546
I mean the pier's empty,
there's no one around.

20:35.548 --> 20:39.283
So he leans and he gives
her this great big smacker.

20:39.285 --> 20:40.618
(LAUGHS)

20:40.620 --> 20:43.087
Kiss of her lifetime right?

20:43.089 --> 20:47.024
Now, this bird should be
floating on air right?

20:47.026 --> 20:48.426
But no.

20:48.428 --> 20:50.028
She's crying again.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.495
Bingo.

20:51.497 --> 20:52.763
Floods of it.

20:52.765 --> 20:54.365
Now look, the bloke is
getting a bit frustrated

20:54.367 --> 20:55.934
now isn't he?

20:55.936 --> 20:57.601
I mean he's just spent five
minutes of his life on this

20:57.603 --> 20:58.837
which he's not gonna get back

20:58.839 --> 21:01.406
and he still hasn't
managed to cheer her up.

21:01.408 --> 21:02.674
I know the feeling.

21:02.676 --> 21:04.775
(SCOFFS)

21:04.777 --> 21:07.846
So he asks her again,
"Now come on darling

21:07.848 --> 21:09.580
"what's the matter with you?

21:09.582 --> 21:11.849
"What are you crying about?"

21:11.851 --> 21:14.118
Well there's a pause.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.688
And she looks up
to him and she says

21:17.690 --> 21:20.260
"Well, I've never been fucked."

21:23.196 --> 21:25.496
So what, what happened?

21:25.498 --> 21:26.697
What does he do?

21:26.699 --> 21:30.301
Well it's a
beautiful night right?

21:30.303 --> 21:33.137
No one around, empty pier.

21:33.139 --> 21:35.907
What do you think
he's gonna do eh?

21:35.909 --> 21:36.743
Yeah.

21:37.910 --> 21:39.310
He pushes her off
the end of the pier.

21:39.312 --> 21:41.378
She drops down into
the drink 50 foot.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.113
He looks over, there she
is bobbing up and down

21:43.115 --> 21:44.849
in her wheelchair like a cog

21:44.851 --> 21:46.251
and he calls out to her

21:46.253 --> 21:48.887
"Well now you are completely
fucked aren't ya?"

21:48.889 --> 21:50.957

this job is or what?

01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:32.062
the biggest theft in history.

01:27:37.933 --> 01:27:41.437
They were walking on
water, I kid you not.

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.810
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

01:28:01.424 --> 01:28:05.528
There's more money in loot
than in your wildest dreams.

01:28:06.595 --> 01:28:07.528

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:08.695
in order to not get caught

is 100% discretion.

01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:16.971
Not living it up,
flashing the cash

01:28:16.973 --> 01:28:19.940
or showing off your
new measure of wealth.

01:28:19.942 --> 01:28:23.546
You just quietly blend
into the background.

01:28:30.419 --> 01:28:32.019
The happiness you
feel is something

01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:34.691
that you never want to end ever.

01:28:35.558 --> 01:28:37.727
But because of this wombat

01:28:38.894 --> 01:28:41.564
he only lasted six sodden weeks.

01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:45.568
I've been back.

01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:48.937
Place is like a ghost town.

01:28:52.008 --> 01:28:52.840
XXX VOICEOVER:
On the second night

01:28:52.842 --> 01:28:55.376
Kenny recced the place

01:28:55.378 --> 01:28:57.744
And he decided to
go in his own car

01:28:57.746 --> 01:29:00.082
instead of the unmarked van.

01:29:06.187 --> 01:29:08.788
There was so much loot
rolling around the big smoke

01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:11.527
anyone who touched
it got burned.

01:29:12.795 --> 01:29:16.163
Some more deserving than others.

01:29:16.165 --> 01:29:18.766
Frank was true to his word.

01:29:18.768 --> 01:29:22.539
He came through on that
favour I asked of him.

01:29:31.013 --> 01:29:34.351
Oh, and the reason
they never caught me?

01:29:37.486 --> 01:29:39.285
Give me a name.

01:29:39.287 --> 01:29:40.122
At least.

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.295
Sorry.

01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:48.494
I never got his name.

01:29:48.496 --> 01:29:49.331
