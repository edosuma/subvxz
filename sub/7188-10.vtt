DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

21:29.821 --> 21:33.558
SOMETIMES A KID
NEEDS A LITTLE PUSH
FROM HIS FRIENDS.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.327
WHOA, HA HA! YEAH!

21:35.327 --> 21:38.096
TRUTH IS, I WAS WRONG
TO HIDE MY NOGGIN.

21:38.096 --> 21:41.400
IT FELT GOOD, LIKE
I WAS BEING CHALLENGED.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.869
AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT IF YOU
HADN'T BELIEVED IN ME.

21:43.869 --> 21:47.506
I MEAN, I WAS EVEN
THINKING OF TAKING
SOME ADVANCED CLASSES.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.541
THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR, SPUD.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.878
THAT I'M THINKING MAYBE
THE LIFE OF A MIME,

21:52.878 --> 21:55.247
NOT SO MUCH
THE LIFE FOR ME.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.550
A FAMOUS SCIENTIST?
OOH, A MATHEMATICIAN?

21:58.550 --> 22:03.288
NO, I'M THINKING MAYBE
I'M MORE OF A ONE-MAN
BAND KIND OF DUDE.

22:03.288 --> 22:05.324
AW, MAN.
AW, MAN.

22:08.360 --> 22:14.366
SPUD, I'M GOING TO SHOW
YOU A NUMBER OF IMAGES.

22:14.366 --> 22:17.235
JUST BLURT OUT WHATEVER
IT IS THEY REMIND YOU OF.

22:17.235 --> 22:22.040
OH, I KNOW, THAT'S A MONKEY
RIDING A UNICYCLE.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.345
MMM, THIS ONE'S A LITTLE
HARDER TO DECIPHER.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.181
IT'S A STINKING MONKEY
RIDING A UNICYCLE.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.951
NOPE, SORRY,
JUST NOT SEEING IT...
