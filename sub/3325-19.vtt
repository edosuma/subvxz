00:01.002 --> 00:02.583
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.795 --> 00:05.036
Are you aware of what
your abilities can do for others?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.829
- And that's all that was left of her.
- Talia.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.038
I have to ask her something.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.499
You can do this.

00:09.969 --> 00:13.678
Skinny, defenseless
Stiles is a nogitsune.

00:17.101 --> 00:18.181
Oh, my God.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.164
Why's it taking so long?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.628
The doctor is on his way.
He comes highly recommended.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.588
Did I ask for a professional reference?

00:50.426 --> 00:53.042
| asked why it was taking so long.

00:53.262 --> 00:57.096
That is a question of time,
not quality of service.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.800
Do you think I would pay
for an idiot to look at him?

01:01.020 --> 01:03.181
- No, Ikeda-sama.
- Can any of you idiots tell me

01:03.397 --> 01:05.854
why he hasn't moved in 12 hours?

01:06.359 --> 01:08.975
No? Then where the hell is the doctor?

01:23.960 --> 01:26.372
Apologize if you can't do anything.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.248
Have you worked with wolves before?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.221
Here and there.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.343
And what's our patient's name?

01:42.311 --> 01:44.051
- Yuki.
- Hello, Yuki.

01:45.356 --> 01:50.521
Now what have you got yourself into,
my friend?

01:57.827 --> 02:00.569
Has Yuki been around any unusual plants?

02:03.499 --> 02:05.114
Something that looks like moss?

02:07.378 --> 02:11.747
It would be bright green, almost neon.

02:13.843 --> 02:16.300
It's called lichen, and it's highly toxic.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.798
I need to know it Yuki has consumed any.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.724
If he has the poison, just treat him.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.928
I'm sorry,
but not without knowing the species.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.316
I need a sample.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.447
It's in the garden.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.400
Shigeki, take him.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.800
Superstitious idiots.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.918
Is this what you're looking for?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.582
Can you hold this, please?

04:24.724 --> 04:28.842
You really think Yuki got in here
and ate this stuff?

04:30.813 --> 04:32.223
Actually,

04:34.608 --> 04:37.816
I think Yuki probably doesn't come
anywhere near here.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.198
I doubt it you could even drag him in.

04:44.827 --> 04:48.319
Some part of him probably senses
what happened here.

04:49.915 --> 04:54.579
To your father
and the nogitsune possessing him.

05:01.385 --> 05:06.049
This particular lichen
is called "Letharia vulpina,"

05:07.391 --> 05:08.551
wolf lichen.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.975
They used it to poison wolves and foxes.

05:12.188 --> 05:17.478
They'd put out pieces of meat
with crushed glass and bits of lichen in it.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.319
The glass perforated
the intestines of the animal,

05:22.531 --> 05:26.365
so the vulpinic acid
could reach the internal organs taster.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.488
What did you do to my wolf?

05:28.704 --> 05:31.741
Well, I didn't poison him with lichen.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.492
But I did give him
a powerful paralytic agent.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.374
The same one I put on that jar.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.133
I guess we both know
a few things, Ikeda-san.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.694
Born out of the blood of a nogitsune,

06:03.906 --> 06:06.943
this lichen is quite special.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.153
More powerful than you know.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.331
What are you going to use it for?

06:19.630 --> 06:23.543
There's a fox hiding inside a teenage boy.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.172
And I'm going to poison it.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.328
Oh, God.

07:45.382 --> 07:49.125
Get back! Everyone, get back!
Everyone, get back!

07:51.430 --> 07:52.840
Allison!

07:53.766 --> 07:54.881
Isaac!

09:14.555 --> 09:15.670
Baac?

09:17.266 --> 09:20.508
He's not breathing.
Scott, he's not breathing!

09:24.523 --> 09:28.436
He's not breathing.
Scott, he's not breathing!

09:35.492 --> 09:37.028
I saw what you did.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.906
Now is not the time for anybody else to see.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.331
Two people said they saw Stiles' jeep
leave the hospital.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.333
Someone needs to find him now.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.175
Is it me, or was this cut?

09:55.387 --> 09:58.003
Tell the others to keep an eye out
for signs of sabotage.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.141
You have to tell Stilinski.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.224
You have to tell him
what's really wrong with Stiles.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.949
Any news?

10:20.162 --> 10:21.777
They're still looking for him.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.122
It's past the 48-hour mark,
but I guess if anyone's

10:25.334 --> 10:29.623
going to be missing for two days
and turn up just fine, it's Stiles.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.419
What about Isaac?

10:34.384 --> 10:37.751
Maybe we should go by the hospital
before school.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.560
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.934
He just needs your signature.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.692
It's just printer cartridges and stuff.
Batteries for the next blackout.

10:54.196 --> 10:57.313
Not a bad idea, considering the number
of electrical problems in this town.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.654
I know you're a bit preoccupied
at the moment.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.954
What is it?

11:06.125 --> 11:09.492
This might sound strange,
but have you had any issues with yakuza?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.503
- Japanese Mafia?
- Specifically, a guy named Katashi.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.804
Have you been here all night?

11:28.230 --> 11:32.018
Yeah, they won't let me see him
'cause I'm not family.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.568
I told them he doesn't have any.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.149
He's got us.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.355
And I've got a key card.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.704
Be quick.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.525
- I thought he'd be healing by now.
- So did I.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.321
Is he in pain?

12:54.358 --> 12:58.271
It won't heal him, but it helps with the pain.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.399
Did Stiles really do this?

13:01.615 --> 13:05.278
Whatever's controlling him did it.
Whatever's inside him.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.780
Well, then how do we get whatever's
inside of him the hell out of him?

13:09.081 --> 13:10.787
I'm working on it.

13:12.084 --> 13:15.167
The thing is, in all of the stories,
kitsune are tricksters.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.121
They're mischievous. They don't really
get caught up in right or wrong

13:18.298 --> 13:19.834
or even understand it.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.962
What's that mean?
It's just doing this for the hell of it?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.169
No, there was something else I found.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.347
If you somehow offend a nogitsune,
it can react pretty badly.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.260
- How do you offend a nogitsune?
- I don't know.

13:32.479 --> 13:37.314
But if it's doing something this bad,
then someone really, really offended if.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.441
Listen up!

13:40.988 --> 13:43.445
Anybody catches
the slightest glimpse of Stilinski,

13:43.657 --> 13:45.773
you contact the first available teacher.
Got it?

13:46.535 --> 13:48.025
- Got it?
- Yes, Coach.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.702
There's a card on my desk for Isaac Lahey,

13:50.914 --> 13:55.123
and every one of you losers
is not only going to sign it,

13:55.294 --> 13:58.502
you're going to write a personal message
so profound and deep,

13:58.714 --> 14:01.797
it's gonna bring a tear to Coach's eye.
Who's first?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.716
Ah, Danny, that's how you do it, buddy.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.168
Keep it PG.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.174
No Stiles, no demonic ninjas.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.598
- Things are getting too quiet.
- Yeah, I know.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.926
Yeah, it's making me nervous, too.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.892
Do you guys hear that?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.770
It's an emitter. One of Argent's.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.773
It's coming from the basement.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.837
Okay, I know what
you guys are thinking, but it's me.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.918
I swear to God, it's me.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.308
Wait, stop.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.935
I said, stop!

15:10.535 --> 15:12.912
It's me, Scott. I swear it's me.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.445
I don't know
where I've been the last two days

15:14.623 --> 15:16.659
or what I've been doing,
but this is me. I promise.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.661
You know what happened at the hospital?

15:19.211 --> 15:21.327
I know more than that.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.006
You see this?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.298
It's a blueprint
of the hospital's electrical wiring.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.215
You see all these markings in red?
That's my handwriting.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.261
I know I did this.
I caused the accident.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.308
And everything in this bag,

15:41.483 --> 15:43.724
it's all stuff that could be
part of something bigger.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.650
What the hell have you been up to?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.693
I think something worse.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.864
A lot worse.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.561
Why were you talking to him?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.140
Because he started talking to me.
He's from the health department.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.769
- Oh, really? That's what he said?
- Yes, really.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.521
They're scheduling hearing tests
with the students.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.777
Hearing tests?
He was talking about hearing?

16:28.989 --> 16:32.857
Yes, hearing.
I'm guessing we should sign you up.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.691
He gave me his card.

16:36.496 --> 16:41.286
Mom, this is a piece of paper
with a phone number written on it.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.787
I know. Still got it.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.556
What the hell were you doing?
Building a Terminator?

16:58.727 --> 17:01.013
- Thank you for that.
- Guys, this is a map.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.516
Isn't that the cross country trail?

17:04.733 --> 17:08.146
That's the Tate car.
Where Malia Tate's family died.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.353
You mean that's where
her father put the steel-jawed traps.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.766
Lose something?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.320
Why are you breaking in to my apartment?

18:39.536 --> 18:43.324
- Why are you leaving emitters in my loft?
- I have no idea why that would be in your loft.

18:49.713 --> 18:53.672
I spent the entirety
of the last two days trying to find Stiles.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.791
- Any luck?
- No.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.464
Me either.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.215
Okay, we're both trying to find Stiles.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.346
Mind if I ask what you plan on doing
if you find him?

19:06.104 --> 19:08.811
Well, that depends on which Stiles I find.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.285
- Coach!
- Stilinski...

19:24.456 --> 19:26.242
Coach, listen close.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.339
Broken.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.671
This isn't mine.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.093
Careful.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.439
- How much do you think that is?
- $150,000.

20:00.659 --> 20:03.571
But it doesn't make sense.
We never took the money.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.152
Whose money is it?

20:06.373 --> 20:09.331
It belongs to a yakuza named Katashi.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.079
- He has a nickname.
- You mean something like...

20:14.464 --> 20:15.749
Silverfinger?

20:16.508 --> 20:17.793
Where did you get that?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.293
Off Katashi's dead body.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.266
What the hell are you doing?

20:32.482 --> 20:34.313
I missed you.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.659
Oh, my God. Did you see
how fast I was running?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.581
I felt it. But we need to stop the others.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.243
- Why?
- Scott!

20:55.755 --> 20:58.337
Stop, stop, stop! Everyone, stop!

21:26.161 --> 21:29.574
Congratulations, Stilinski.
You found a length of chain.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.788
Can somebody now
please tell me what the hell's going on?

21:37.005 --> 21:38.415
Hey, Coach!

21:43.303 --> 21:44.418
Oh, crap.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.571
While it's smart to bring me with you,
I still think the rest of this is totally insane.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.735
I tried to find Stiles,
and I led everyone into a mental institution.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.161
I call that a colossal failure.

22:12.373 --> 22:17.037
Look, I just need to figure this out,
and he's the only one offering help.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.629
Peter doesn't offer help.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.129
He offers a chance
for you to be manipulated

22:21.299 --> 22:24.917
- into giving him what he wants.
- Fine, let's see what he wants.

22:31.392 --> 22:34.008
The hunter and the Banshee.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.191
Get it out of me!
Get it out of me. Get it out of me.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.359
- Coach.
- Oh, my God, I'm going to die.

22:44.572 --> 22:48.064
- Get it out of me! I'm going to die!
- Coach, you're not going to die.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.273
I'm going to die!

22:49.452 --> 22:51.488
- It will hurt less if you stop moving, Coach.
- Get that thing out of me!

22:51.663 --> 22:54.496
- Stay still, Coach. An ambulance is coming.
- Get it out! I'm gonna die!

22:54.707 --> 22:58.325
Get back! Get back!
Give him some room! Get back!

23:14.269 --> 23:15.554
I think he just passed out.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.559
I could have killed him.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.145
I could have killed him, right?
What if it was his head or his throat?

23:23.361 --> 23:26.228
But it wasn't,
and he's going to be all right.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.106
I think I just heard an ambulance coming.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.942
And my dad.

23:36.165 --> 23:41.501
So, I don't suppose you have any idea
why Stiles would frame us for murder?

23:41.713 --> 23:45.046
I didn't think Stiles was smart enough
to frame us for murder.

23:45.258 --> 23:49.001
To be honest, I'm not entirely convinced
that's why we're here.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.797
What do you mean?

23:51.014 --> 23:54.472
McCall is going to come out here
in a minute and probably talk attorneys.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.846
Say you've agreed
to allow mine to represent you.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.191
Why should I trust your attorney?

24:05.778 --> 24:08.110
Because I'm not calling my attorney yet.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.021
I just want more time.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.860
To do what?

24:13.494 --> 24:15.621
To figure out what we're really doing here.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.334
She goes.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.328
The last time I was alone with you,

24:25.548 --> 24:27.834
I almost bled out on a lacrosse field.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.250
She stays.

24:30.470 --> 24:34.179
Do you actually think
I was trying to kill you when I bit you?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.506
You were my backup plan, remember?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.300
Not to mention, the bite
is what brought out your nascent abilities.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.057
You think power like that
was going to come out on its own?

24:43.566 --> 24:46.808
I'm the spark that lit your fire, sweetheart.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.817
You attacked her and nearly killed her.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.567
Power doesn't come
without a little pain and struggle.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.239
I didn't ask for it.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.362
But you're embracing it now, aren't you?

24:55.954 --> 24:57.535
How about the fact
that you brainwashed her

24:57.747 --> 24:59.533
and used her to bring yourself back to life?

24:59.749 --> 25:03.537
So that I could be here today
to help you master your abilities.

25:03.753 --> 25:06.586
Isn't it amazing
how things come full circle?

25:06.798 --> 25:09.164
He's insane. We're leaving.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.089
You want the truth, Lydia?

25:16.265 --> 25:18.221
It's not the scream that gives you power.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.930
All the scream does
is help drown out the noise,

25:21.145 --> 25:24.057
allowing you to hear
what you really need to,

25:24.273 --> 25:26.889
andlcan
help you focus your hearing.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.898
But you want something in return.

25:31.114 --> 25:35.608
No, I'm dedicating my life
to helping out narcissistic teenage girls.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.825
Of course I want something in return.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.300
Scott, you better look at this.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.274
This is the same wrapping paper
we used on Coach's birthday present.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.147
Wasn't that William Barrow's thing?

26:12.363 --> 26:15.901
A bomb made from nails and bolts
all wrapped in a birthday present?

26:16.117 --> 26:17.698
Where did it go off?

26:22.957 --> 26:24.037
On a school bus.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.786
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

26:26.502 --> 26:27.662
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

26:27.879 --> 26:29.540
Move! Everyone back!

26:30.256 --> 26:32.622
Get away from the bus!
Get back now!

26:32.842 --> 26:34.673
Come on, let's go, guys! Keep it moving!

26:35.261 --> 26:37.502
Come on, guys, let's go!
Go, go, go!

26:37.722 --> 26:39.337
Come on, move, guys.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.193
They told me not to move.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.861
Jared, right?

26:56.074 --> 26:58.030
They told me not to move.

26:58.242 --> 27:02.155
They said, "Stay right where you are
and don't move a muscle."

27:02.914 --> 27:03.949
It's all right.

27:04.165 --> 27:07.032
I didn't know what it was
when I picked it up.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.332
I didn't know.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.702
It's all right, Jared.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.462
I'm just going to take a look, all right?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.982
These are the claws of Derek's mother?

27:34.153 --> 27:37.771
My sister, Talia. Before she died,
she stole a memory from me.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.612
It's something only
a very powerful Alpha can do.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.402
That memory is locked inside those claws.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.738
Why would your sister want
to steal a memory from you?

27:46.958 --> 27:49.995
Well, if I remembered the memory,
I might be able to tell you.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.002
So what am I supposed to do?

28:00.138 --> 28:03.175
Get them out of here!
Back those kids up! Move!

28:04.684 --> 28:06.390
We wait for the bomb squad.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.264
I'm a certified HDT.
Two years in the Army.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.772
I can at least find out
if this thing's real.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.496
- Focus.
- I am focusing!

28:28.666 --> 28:31.533
You're not! I can see the wheels spinning
behind your eyes.

28:32.712 --> 28:37.046
Your hearing is attuned to a level
of the universe no one else can hear.

28:37.258 --> 28:39.340
But only if you're listening.

28:39.552 --> 28:40.758
I'm trying.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.506
Try harder!

28:51.355 --> 28:53.016
Your aunt had one of those.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.936
- Aunty Kate.
- Stop it.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.021
Both of you.

28:58.196 --> 29:00.653
Didn't do her much good
as I ripped her throat out, did it?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.856
- She didn't shove it up your...
- Stop it!

29:19.759 --> 29:21.090
Lydia?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.299
Lydia, do you hear something?

29:29.393 --> 29:31.099
What is it?

29:31.312 --> 29:32.802
What are they saying?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.773
Is it the memory?

29:37.526 --> 29:39.437
What did Talia take from me?

29:41.364 --> 29:43.229
Tell me what she knew!

29:54.835 --> 29:56.575
You're notjust an uncle.

30:06.389 --> 30:09.051
- I could easily get out of these, you know.
- So could I.

30:09.225 --> 30:12.342
But I'm not interested
in being a fugitive from the law.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.140
Well, I'm not interested
in being a victim

30:15.356 --> 30:18.268
to a 17-year-old
possessed by a psychotic fox.

30:18.526 --> 30:19.936
Just give me a few more minutes.

30:21.779 --> 30:22.985
Derek!

30:23.990 --> 30:25.321
Fine.

30:25.533 --> 30:30.152
If something happens, don't expect me
to risk my life trying to save yours.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.003
Close the door.

30:45.386 --> 30:48.970
You hid them in a book?
Couldn't you find something more secure?

30:49.181 --> 30:52.048
How many high school students do you
know who would willingly open a book?

30:56.355 --> 30:59.688
- You still haven't talked to Kira, have you?
- Barely a word since the hospital.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.895
You need to tell her.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.567
Especially about this.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.029
You've already sacrificed five.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.192
Three of the oni are gone.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.827
How many more tails
are you willing to sacrifice?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.159
If I have to,

31:16.375 --> 31:17.364
all of them.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.027
These oni will be stronger.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.439
Much stronger.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.195
Jared, it will be very helpful

31:55.373 --> 31:58.206
if you could resist throwing up
on the potential explosive device.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.455
- Hey, can you do that for me?
- I think so.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.628
- You... You look really...
- Handsome?

32:07.885 --> 32:09.216
Thank you.

32:09.387 --> 32:11.924
For a second there, I thought
you were going to say I look really young,

32:12.139 --> 32:15.006
and I was gonna have to launch into my
explanation about how I'm actually 24,

32:15.226 --> 32:17.968
and that anyone can look young
if they eat right and exercise.

32:18.187 --> 32:20.303
Although, it's probably
just good genes anyway, right?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.321
Huh.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.413
It's not a bomb, sir,
but there is something in the box.

33:02.356 --> 33:06.144
It's just printer cartridges and stuff.
Batteries for the next blackout.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.022
Not a bad idea, considering the number
of electrical problems in this town.

33:09.238 --> 33:12.105
My God. There is a bomb, but not here.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.794
What's happening?

33:32.595 --> 33:34.335
What's happening?

33:44.482 --> 33:45.597
Get down!

34:12.760 --> 34:15.376
Get me an ambulance here
at the sheriff's station.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.887
We've got an explosion. We got multiple
officers down. Multiple officers down.

34:19.099 --> 34:22.262
We need an ambulance ASAP.
On the double.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.642
Scott?

34:25.481 --> 34:26.641
Scott?

34:31.237 --> 34:32.852
Derek. Derek.

34:35.115 --> 34:36.400
I'm okay.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.528
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.827
You saved my life.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.779
Can you do something?

34:43.999 --> 34:46.866
Take his pain?
Anything to make it easier?

35:22.371 --> 35:24.077
Go! Move!

35:29.878 --> 35:31.334
I need an ambulance!

35:32.298 --> 35:34.084
The oni, they're coming.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.044
Stiles, we gotta get you out of here.

35:37.386 --> 35:40.423
I said I don't know.
I don't know its name,

35:40.598 --> 35:44.011
if it's a boy or a girl,
or if it's some mutated wolf baby.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.763
You're lying.
Tell me what you know.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.349
Tell me. Tell...

35:55.362 --> 35:56.943
Now we're leaving.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.576
Lydia!

36:08.459 --> 36:09.414
The animal clinic?

36:09.627 --> 36:11.333
Yeah, the place is lined with Mountain Ash,
just like my house.

36:11.545 --> 36:12.580
It will buy us some time.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.253
- But they can get through it?
- Eventually.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.002
Nobody's got any better ideas?

36:18.969 --> 36:21.176
Okay, sure, animal clinic.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.092
I got mine. Did you find yours?

36:28.687 --> 36:30.143
Yeah.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.522
Peter and Malia?

36:42.576 --> 36:44.316
Father and daughter.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.056
Stiles, get inside.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.988
Hey, Kira, get inside! Kira!

38:16.587 --> 38:18.873
All right, come on.
Get him inside! Get him inside!

39:00.422 --> 39:01.753
You okay?

39:02.716 --> 39:05.002
- Please don't. Stop.
- It's okay.

39:18.357 --> 39:20.769
Does it hurt? Hey, look at me.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.317
You should have done your reading, Scott.

39:26.198 --> 39:32.239
See, a nogitsune feeds off chaos,
strife and pain.

39:33.163 --> 39:37.998
This morning, you took it from Isaac,
then you took it from Coach,

39:38.210 --> 39:40.542
and then from a dying deputy.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.337
All that pain, you took it all.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.669
Now, give it to me.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.437
You really have to learn, Scott.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.606
You really have to learn not to trust a fox.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.919
No, 'cause they're tricksters.
They'll fool you.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.789
They'll fool everyone.

40:27.467 --> 40:28.968
Not everyone.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.707
What was that? Was that a cure?
Is he okay?

41:02.878 --> 41:05.711
The fox is poisoned, but it's not dead.

41:09.593 --> 41:10.753
Not yet.
