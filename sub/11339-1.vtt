is his signature,

00:06.122 --> 00:07.739
And we'll find that he's
always killed this way.

00:07.776 --> 00:10.060
He's shows up during a blackout, he robs,
he kills, he leaves a witness.

00:10.112 --> 00:12.530
He got away with it for 26 years.
Why did he come back?

Spicer were killed.

00:14.333 --> 00:15.499
Those are my parents.

Why is he doing this?

so they'll never forget him,

00:18.453 --> 00:20.503
But with you,
it goes beyond that.

00:20.513 --> 00:22.713
He believes he turned you
into the city's hero.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.943
And he wants that recognition..

00:24.040 --> 00:25.257
He wants everyone
to know what he's done.

Where is she?

32:18.882 --> 32:23.352
but, um, sometimes
circumstances, it's...

32:25.388 --> 32:27.756
Look...

32:27.807 --> 32:32.895
You can tell I'm not
a hostage negotiator.

32:32.946 --> 32:36.365
But I am a mother.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.951
And I...

32:39.035 --> 32:42.821
I know what your mother
did to you when you were little.

32:42.906 --> 32:45.274
What she was,

32:45.342 --> 32:49.461
what she made you watch,
what she let men do to you,

32:49.546 --> 32:52.614
and it makes me so...

32:52.666 --> 32:57.253
It's just not fair.

32:57.304 --> 32:59.454
And no one--
no one can make that better.

32:59.506 --> 33:01.507
I wish I could. I do. But...

33:01.591 --> 33:03.625
If I--if I could somehow
go back there

33:03.677 --> 33:07.963
and, you know, make what was
happening to you stop,

33:08.014 --> 33:09.464
if I could just...

33:09.516 --> 33:13.468
You know, pick you up
and just tell you

33:13.520 --> 33:15.321
that it'll all be ok.

33:15.405 --> 33:19.308
That's what moms
are supposed to do.

33:19.359 --> 33:21.810
They're not supposed to be
the cause of your pain,

33:21.861 --> 33:24.646
they're supposed to
make it go away.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.481
They're supposed to hold you

33:26.533 --> 33:30.485
and tell you everything
is gonna be all right.

33:30.537 --> 33:35.157
They're supposed to tell you
that thunder is Angels bowling

33:35.208 --> 33:37.209
and that it's ok
to be afraid of the dark

33:37.294 --> 33:40.462
and that it's not silly
to think there might be

33:40.513 --> 33:42.331
monsters in your closet
and that it's ok

33:42.382 --> 33:44.850
that if you want to climb in bed with them
just this once,

33:44.934 --> 33:50.522
'cause it's scary
in the room all alone.

33:50.607 --> 33:53.275
They're supposed to say
it's ok to be afraid,

33:53.343 --> 33:55.644
and not be the thing
you're afraid of.

33:55.695 --> 33:58.113
But most importantly,

33:58.181 --> 34:02.067
they're supposed to love you
no matter what.

34:02.152 --> 34:05.037
What happened to you
isn't fair, it's not right,

34:05.121 --> 34:08.040
but, um...

34:08.123 --> 34:12.460
I'm supposed to empathize
with you.

34:12.527 --> 34:16.965
Sympathize. Understand.

34:17.033 --> 34:18.367
But I can't.

34:18.418 --> 34:20.034
That--that would be a lie.

34:20.085 --> 34:23.304
The truth is, I don't
understand what you've done.

34:23.373 --> 34:27.393
I don't sympathize with you killing people
all these years.

34:27.476 --> 34:30.512
And I especially don't
understand you taking Ellie.

34:30.563 --> 34:34.149
What I can do is tell you
what a mother should tell you,

34:34.217 --> 34:36.485
that you can't
take away your pain

34:36.552 --> 34:37.770
by hurting someone else.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.554
That it doesn't make
all the nights

34:39.606 --> 34:41.357
you went to bed
scared and alone

34:41.408 --> 34:43.058
any better if you
scare someone else

34:43.109 --> 34:44.909
the way you're scaring Ellie.

34:44.994 --> 34:47.079
What happened to you,
it isn't fair.

34:47.163 --> 34:49.281
But what you're doing
to her isn't fair either,

34:49.366 --> 34:52.067
and if anyone should
understand what that feels like,

34:52.118 --> 34:54.920
it's you.

34:55.004 --> 34:57.121
You have the power.

34:57.207 --> 35:01.760
You can do
what you want to do.

35:01.845 --> 35:03.762
But for once,

35:03.847 --> 35:07.299
you can choose
to use that power

35:07.384 --> 35:10.436
to do for Ellie what should have
been done for you.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.640
You can choose
letting her go.

35:14.724 --> 35:16.275
You can choose teaching her

35:16.359 --> 35:18.977
that, yes,
there are monsters,

35:19.062 --> 35:22.114
and it's ok
to be afraid of them.

35:22.198 --> 35:25.984
But it's not ok
to let them win.

35:26.069 --> 35:28.721
And it's not ok to be one.

6 blocks from here.
