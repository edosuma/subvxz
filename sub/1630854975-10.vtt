00:28.162 --> 00:30.398
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:30.398 --> 00:32.199
<i>Hell of an engagement ring.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:34.568
Unfortunately,
that ring belongs to me.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.504
What I need,
only Noma can get me.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.638
If I get you these green cards,

00:37.638 --> 00:39.507
will you please
stall Noma out for me?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.142
Noma said that Lombardi
was her ex.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.576
This is her kid.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.811
This is her Achilles' heel.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.246
What the fuck is this?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.215
You're not being arrested
for drug dealing, Effie.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.284
<i>That's the bitch
that tried to kill me.</i>

00:50.284 --> 00:51.452
This is a RICO.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.621
You're looking at 20 years
federal time.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.190
Weston Holdings
is a fucking Ponzi scheme.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.159
That means my fucking
trust fund money is gone.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.393
Yeah, and the Tejadas'.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.128
You gave our money
to a bunch of motherfuckers.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.730
Now I gotta go
get it the fuck back.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.599
Yeah, I'm into
this honesty thing.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.168
I'm just not into losing.

01:07.168 --> 01:10.738
That's funny,
because you're losing me.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.739
<i>What's that?</i>

01:11.739 --> 01:12.773
A letter from my lawyer.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.708
Saxe says Tariq set me up
to get arrested.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.744
We better not do anything
till we know for sure.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.078
<i>Why would Papi's prints</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.447
<i>be at the scene
of Zeke's murder?</i>

01:19.447 --> 01:21.248
It was your mother.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.517
<i>She wanted Lorenzo dead.</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:25.152
I'm so done
with your lying bullshit!

01:25.152 --> 01:26.854
I would have did the same thing
for any of you!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.656
If anybody should be dead,
it's yo ass.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.657
- I should be dead?
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:29.657 --> 01:31.258
Get the fuck off her!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.427
Don't you ever put your
fucking hands on me again.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.762
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.301
How did you even find me?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.269
Your buddy, Monet Tejada.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.871
This battle between us
has gotta end.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.377
Tameika, where's my mom?

01:50.377 --> 01:51.879

did Tommy get to her?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.323
Saxe.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.591
Working from beyond
the fucking grave.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.725
He had a fail-safe just in case

04:51.725 --> 04:53.427
anyone figured out
he was a rat.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.829
- Mole.
- What?

04:55.829 --> 04:58.432
Technically,
Saxe was a mole, not a rat.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.867
Who gives a fuck?
It's the same shit.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.771
Either way, that mole knew
where my mom was,

05:03.771 --> 05:05.739
and he told Monet,
and Monet told Tommy.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.907
Fuck.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.575
I mean, why would she do that?

05:08.575 --> 05:09.743
I don't know.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.978
All I know is,
I'm taking Tommy and Monet

05:10.978 --> 05:12.613
- off the fucking map.
- Okay, whoa.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.781
We can't make that move

05:13.781 --> 05:14.948
with Lauren about to testify

05:14.948 --> 05:16.316
<i>and Effie in custody.</i>

05:16.316 --> 05:19.486
If she flips on us,
we're fucked, 'Riq.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.755
- You think--
- Who knows, bro?

05:21.755 --> 05:24.525
I mean, at least your uncle
isn't a threat to us anymore.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.695
You're good with all that, right?

05:28.362 --> 05:30.364
He's a fucking coward.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.402
Look, I can't even--can't even
think about shit like that

05:35.402 --> 05:36.870
until I know my mom's
all right.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.572
What can I do?

05:40.641 --> 05:41.675
You strapped?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.110
Yeah, I'm strapped, motherfucker.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.578
Let me see that.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.746
Hurry up.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.584
All right, good looking.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.685
I'ma hit you
when I need you, a'ight?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.786
Bet.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.135
Monet Tejada.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.838
I'm surprised
it's taken this long.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.773
We don't need to chitchat.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.075
That's a lot of product you've
got sitting on them shelves.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.510
You asked for this meeting.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.645
You must have
a solution for me.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.414
For which problem?

06:20.414 --> 06:22.616
Your Wall Street operations
are shut down,

06:22.616 --> 06:24.151
the feds are at the gate,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.586
and weight ain't moving
through the Ivies

06:25.586 --> 06:27.721
because that girl Effie
got locked up.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.492
I did not want to worry you prematurely.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.393
I was told
it would all be rectified.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.695
<i>Who told you that shit?</i>

06:34.695 --> 06:36.029
That Tariq nigga?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.464
You can't trust him.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.566
Only my streets
is bringing in money right now

06:39.566 --> 06:41.034
because I finessed
the Russians,

06:41.034 --> 06:43.837
took Kai out,
and wiped out the Castillos.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.073
Do I have a solution?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.842
I'm the solution.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.511
Empty promise.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.412
How will you manage
our operations

06:52.412 --> 06:55.482
when your own children want
nothing to do with you?

06:55.482 --> 06:57.651
Look, if you back me,
I'll keep them in line,

06:57.651 --> 06:59.086
get your weight moving again.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.192
Before I could possibly agree
to this,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.795
I need some answers.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.532
What happened to my fiancé,
Mecca?

07:21.008 --> 07:23.043
Tariq! Oh, my God.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.611
- It's been so long.
- Cut the shit.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.947
- Where's Tommy?
- You fucking kidding me.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.081
Is that how you wanna talk
to me?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.450
Okay. Where's Tommy, ma'am?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.085
He's dead.
Didn't you get the memo?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.153
Listen,
this is serious shit.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.088
I need to know where Tommy is. Now.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.891
All right, I expect
you're not gonna go away

07:37.891 --> 07:39.827
unless you see for yourself.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.231
<i>What are you...</i>

07:44.464 --> 07:47.501
Tariq, he's not here.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.469
He never is.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.737
Come on.

07:50.737 --> 07:51.972
- What did he do?
- Listen.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.707
He went after
my fucking mother, all right?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.175
And I swear to God,
if anything happens to her--

07:55.175 --> 07:57.077
Tariq, I raised your dad,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.178
my son is a drug lord,

07:58.178 --> 07:59.880
his father was a made man,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.715
and I have pictures of you
in diapers,

08:01.715 --> 08:04.885
so just calm down.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.487
Take your hand
off the fucking gun.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.626
Okay, good.

08:13.227 --> 08:15.996
Nobody's gonna hurt you here, sweetie.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.001
Oh...

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
What are you drinking?

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
Hennessy?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.205
I don't usually drink.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.773
Juice box?

08:26.773 --> 08:27.908
Look, I need to find my mother,

08:27.908 --> 08:28.976
and Tommy's
the only fucking person

08:28.976 --> 08:30.143
that knows where she is.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.746
What, are you gonna shoot me
if I don't tell you?

08:33.881 --> 08:34.982
<i>Come on.</i>

08:34.982 --> 08:36.783
That never occurred to you.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.151
Sit down.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.853
You're a good kid,

08:39.853 --> 08:42.756
in spite of
all your role models.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.691
Yeah, Mrs. Egan, I'm afraid
I'm not the same kid

08:44.691 --> 08:45.692
that you remember.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.095
Well, I can see that, baby.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.097
But you know,
I don't know shit.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.769
This woman with red hair--
her name was Monique.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.070
<i>Whoa, whoa, M-Monet?</i>

08:57.070 --> 08:58.071
Her.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.640
So she came to my house,

08:59.640 --> 09:00.641
and she gave me a letter.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.909
She wanted me to give it
to Tommy.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.777
That fucking letter had
my mom's address on it.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.679
Well, I didn't know that, Tariq.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.648
You know
I try not to get involved.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.684
Listen, if you can tell Tommy
that Monet dropped by,

09:10.684 --> 09:12.085
you can tell him
that I'm looking for him.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.022
Hey, hey, Tariq,
you're still a kid.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.257
And- and what I do know
about my son

09:17.257 --> 09:22.229
is that you never wanna get
on his wrong side.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.064
We both have that in common.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.939
Mecca meant this for me.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.006
Keep it.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.174
I don't want that shit.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.011
You didn't love Mecca?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.112
No.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.682
Your son Zeke.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.116
Mecca was his father.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.318
Yes.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.786
And now you wanna use me

09:45.786 --> 09:48.055
to bring your family back
into your fold.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.923
Interesting choice.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.992
Look, I'm trying
to protect my family.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.994
Wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.162
Let's be clear.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.997
You don't know anything
about me.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.966
But if I had children,
I'd keep them as far away

09:58.966 --> 10:01.001
from this world as possible, love.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.103
Well, I tried that shit
with Zeke,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.739
and he's the one
who's dead now.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.775
Yeah, and I'm sorry
for your loss.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.344
Were you trying
to protect Zeke?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.778
<i>Is that what happened
to Mecca?</i>

10:11.778 --> 10:12.980
<i>Look, I ain't admitting
to shit,</i>

10:12.980 --> 10:14.348
<i>but I will tell you this much.</i>

10:14.348 --> 10:16.883
I will kill
to protect my family.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.086
<i>So an ex-lover killed Mecca.</i>

10:19.086 --> 10:21.121
How fucking ordinary.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.222
Well, if that's the case,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.690
you really gonna let a fuckboy

10:23.690 --> 10:24.858
get between our business?

10:24.858 --> 10:26.226
A woman in my position

10:26.226 --> 10:28.996
has to consider all the angles
to stay on top.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.999
Mecca's murder,
I never saw it coming.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.067
He kept you and your son
a secret.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.236
I was so blind,

10:36.236 --> 10:37.804
so in the dark,

10:37.804 --> 10:39.840
it made me feel vulnerable.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.275
And I can't afford that, love.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.679
I understand the need
for that control.

10:45.679 --> 10:49.282
Yeah, well, I'm sure
we have many things in common.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.119
And I can't tolerate deception.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.720
In any form.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.889
I've served you loyally, Noma.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.159
And you'll continue to do so
with a reminder.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.803
Are we clear, Mrs. Tejada?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.171
Crystal.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.839
Good.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.909
Anything suspicious
about the Weston suicide?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.110
Abso-fucking-lutely.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.712
Nothing we can prove.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.813
Circle the wagons.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.214
We need to protect
the witnesses.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.682
Where are we with Morales?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.018
Transferred into federal
custody and processed.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.687
Couple nights in the MCC
will soften her up.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.823
And after Lauren testifies
in front of the grand jury,

11:29.823 --> 11:31.958
we'll have Effie indicted
on attempted murder.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.226
- She'll cave.
- Hmm.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.362
She'll connect Tariq
to the Tejadas,

11:35.362 --> 11:38.098
and then we can charge
Diana Tejada with the RICO,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.167
and she'll fold on the rest
of the organization.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.402
I'll finish digging
into Morales's records.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.171
These two girls,
Effie and Diana,

11:44.171 --> 11:45.338
both Stansfield students?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.074
With promising futures.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.308
That's pretty savage.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.743
That's how we play it.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.779
Good afternoon, Miss Baldwin.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.448
<i>We're here to talk you through
the grand jury hearing.</i>

11:55.382 --> 11:57.818
I talked to Cooper Saxe.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.219
How is his death related
to this?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.353
Was that Tariq?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.322
Of course it was.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.490
We're still investigating.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.926
We're not ready
to make that case.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.494
The words "grand jury"
may sound scary,

12:07.727 --> 12:08.795
but it's not a trial.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.064
The process
is merely a formality.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.966
Typically,
an AUSA would take over,

12:12.966 --> 12:14.267
but I've been waived in,

12:14.267 --> 12:15.435
<i>so I'll be with you
every step of the way,</i>

12:15.435 --> 12:16.503
<i>asking the questions.</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:17.838
And no defense,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.106
no cross-examination.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.807
You just say what you know.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.275
They'll assess the evidence

12:22.275 --> 12:24.211
and vote to indict Ms. Morales.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.114
You're not asking me
to blame this on Tariq?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.015
No, no. Effie is our goal here.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.383
This is about getting justice
for you.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.985
Justice?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.054
My life is never gonna be
the same.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.222
<i>I hear you, Lauren.</i>

12:35.222 --> 12:36.289
I do.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.958
But it'll be a life,

12:37.958 --> 12:40.961
<i>and your bravery
will keep others safe.</i>

12:40.961 --> 12:42.229
I wanna see my family.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.464
Soon. I promise.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.000
Please don't do anything crazy
in the home stretch.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.969
You don't wanna expose them, Lauren.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.341
Yo, what the fuck
you doing here?

12:54.341 --> 12:55.942
It seems y'all can't keep
Noma happy,

12:55.942 --> 12:58.311
so I'm your new boss now.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.984
- You're welcome.
- Fuck, nah.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.952
- No, no.
- Dru, chill the fuck out.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.087
<i>This ain't no game.</i>

13:08.388 --> 13:09.956
So we answer to you now?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.859
If you answer to Noma,
you answer to Monet.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.261
In other words,
no more fucking around.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.196
Cane, Dru,
you back on the streets.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.564
Tell your sister to call me.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.166
And you two
<i>Trading Places</i> motherfuckers

13:19.166 --> 13:20.901
owe me some serious money.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.003
Wipe that fucking smirk
off your face.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.938
Y'all gave my money
to the country club crooks,

13:24.938 --> 13:27.007
<i>so your name
is on that bill now too.</i>

13:27.007 --> 13:28.542
And y'all gotta make
Noma whole again too.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.077
So put your fucking
Beavis and Butt-Heads together

13:31.077 --> 13:32.345
and find a new market.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.147
The only thing keeping you
alive is your debt.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.515
And you.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.083
We need to talk.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.257
Now, why the fuck you telling
my kids I killed Lorenzo?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.358
How the fuck
would I know that shit?

13:45.358 --> 13:46.560
I ain't tell them nothing.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.495
Well, you knew it wasn't GTG
that killed Zeke,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.096
and I'm sure you figured out
the rest of that shit too.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.598
Oh, that's why you sent Tommy
after my mother.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.066
Nigga, I don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.367
I ain't have shit
to do with that.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.835
But if it was left up to me,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.437
Cane would be digging
your grave right now.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.972
But lucky for you,
you need to keep

13:58.972 --> 14:00.507
your little bitches in line first.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.043
Effie and Lauren can't talk.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.278
- Am I clear?
- Yes.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.552
Tariq, a moment.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.054
The green cards.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.222
My family received approval.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.423
Yeah, I know that,
but you were supposed

14:16.423 --> 14:17.958
to stall Noma until
we figured something out.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.092
Yet Noma knows everything

14:19.092 --> 14:20.293
and Monet's now
the fucking boss?

14:20.293 --> 14:23.930
This is what I received
from stalling Noma.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.932
Be happy she prevented Monet
from killing you

14:25.932 --> 14:28.168
till the heat was off
of our enterprise.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.936
It will benefit us all

14:29.936 --> 14:32.906
when you are back
in Noma's good graces.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.643
Use the time wisely.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.578
I will.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.081
<i>Hey, what's up? It's Di.</i>

14:41.081 --> 14:42.082
<i>Leave a message.</i>

14:42.082 --> 14:44.117
Diana, get over your shit

14:44.117 --> 14:45.318
<i>and call me back.</i>

14:45.318 --> 14:46.419
<i>We need to talk
about Saxe's letters.</i>

14:46.419 --> 14:48.521
Is Tariq a snitch or not?

15:07.974 --> 15:09.276
Don't do nothing stupid.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.343
And follow me.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.219
You got some fucking balls.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.154
You brought a fucking gun
to my mother's house?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.188
This exact fucking one,
Uncle Tommy.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.490
I swear to my life I'll use it

15:23.490 --> 15:24.658
if you don't tell me
what happened to my mother.

15:24.658 --> 15:27.093
Yeah, all right.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.929
You quit popping off,
and I'll tell you.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.999
Put the gun down first, Tariq.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.135
You wanna know where your
mother is, put the gun away.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.972
We hashed it out, okay?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.474
You got the drop on me.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.943
<i>And then thank God your mother
knocked you the fuck out,</i>

15:43.943 --> 15:46.012
'cause you was about to shoot.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.281
I love you,
but I'll put a bullet in you

15:48.281 --> 15:49.649
to stop you
from killing my mother.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.419
You think you're finally
gonna kill me, huh?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.621
Well, you killed your father.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.023
So pulling the trigger on me
ain't gonna be nothing to you.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.058
<i>No.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:06.466
I just saved your life, Tommy.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.171
What, you're gonna kill me

16:11.171 --> 16:13.506
while I'm trying to check
on my baby?

16:13.506 --> 16:14.607
Yeah, come here.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.276
You gotta turn him like this.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.044
Towards you,
so he's on his side.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.579
Okay, okay, be careful, please.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.548
I ain't the one
who just knocked his ass out.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.149
He's fine.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.617
He's just sleeping it off.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.620
Why'd you do this?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.023
You had the drop on me.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.359
I've already lost
too much family, Tommy.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.127
We don't need
to kill each other.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.563
Let's dead this shit.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.298
Family.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.166
What about me?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.501
What about Keisha?

16:41.501 --> 16:45.105
You think I wanted
to kill my best friend?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.439
Like that shit was easy?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.208
She was gonna rat on my son

16:48.208 --> 16:49.376
and then she was gonna rat on you.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.079
- No.
- No, I saved your life again.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.547
Listen to me.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.450
Our blood feud ends now.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.285
Or else we're gonna end up
in the grave

16:59.285 --> 17:01.654
just like Lakeisha,
just like Ghost.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.158
Fuck.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.761
Tasha...

17:07.761 --> 17:09.162
Fuck.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.298
Look, I love you, Tommy.
I never stopped.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.135
Don't ever forget how we've
been there for each other.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.670
We are day-ones.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.539
We're the only ones left.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.475
I know.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.778
I just feel like
I keep losing my people.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.679
So let's not lose each other.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.651
God, Tash, I wish we could
just smoke a blunt

17:31.651 --> 17:32.685
and ride around the city.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.120
I got so much I wanna tell you.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.655
- You know, I got a brother?
- What?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.756
That's insane, Tommy.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.291
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's a half-brother.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.093
But he got a son.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.395
I'm a actual uncle now.

17:42.395 --> 17:46.099
So you know it's real
when I tell you

17:46.099 --> 17:48.601
I want this shit to be over.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.336
I trust you
with that information.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.405
So is my family safe from you?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.507
Cause your family's safe
from me.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.243
What the fuck you mean, Tommy?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.245
We are family.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.283
I love you, too, Tash.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.486
But I gotta get
the fuck up out of here.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.087
All right.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.323
Where is she?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.491
I don't know.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.193
When the marshals showed up,
we took off.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.395
But I know she wouldn't
want you going after Monet.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.830
You speak for my mother now.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.431
If you put Monet in the ground,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.133
<i>then you're getting
your mother,</i>

18:20.133 --> 18:22.602
your other sister,
and your grandmother killed.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.504
Uncle Tommy, fuck that noise.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.705
Okay?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.106
Monet made a fucking move already.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.174
I need to retaliate.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.176
You ain't got no ally.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.711
<i>You ain't got no plan for war.</i>

18:31.711 --> 18:33.713
You need to rethink
your beef with her.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.114
You think I can't handle
a fucking war

18:35.114 --> 18:36.149
by myself, Uncle Tommy?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.717
I know you can't ride one out

18:37.717 --> 18:39.786
from the back of a fucking
college classroom.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.354
Your father tried
to ride one out

18:41.354 --> 18:42.856
from between two worlds.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.258
It's what fucked him up.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.426
If you wanna survive,

18:46.426 --> 18:48.595
you either a civilian
or a gangster.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.762
There ain't no in-between.

18:49.762 --> 18:50.830
Stay in your lane.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.532
All in or all out.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.901
If you get distracted...

18:55.134 --> 18:56.236
you dead.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.842
A'ight,
so say I do hear you out.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.611
<i>Say I'm all in.</i>

19:04.611 --> 19:06.179
You care, right?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.314
You proved that
by having my fucking back.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.287
Oh, Tariq...

19:14.287 --> 19:16.356
this ain't my war.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.692
Plus, in New York,
I'm already dead.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.272
Be smart, Tariq.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.351
<i>Less than 24 hours away,</i>

19:45.351 --> 19:48.555
and polls show Rashad Tate
firmly in the lead

19:48.555 --> 19:50.323
over his rival, AVH,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.959
<i>to be the twelfth district's
democratic nominee.</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:55.261
And in New York,
that's a guaranteed ticket

19:55.261 --> 19:56.462
to Congress.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.832
Okay, okay, okay.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.268
Please, not until after
the election.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.803
Don't jinx my ass.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.241
Taking on Weston Holdings
was brave.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.976
Courage is never something
that I lacked.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.645
No, courage was never
your problem.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.747
Ethical conviction
was your issue,

20:14.747 --> 20:17.283
but you showed me

20:17.283 --> 20:19.752
you are who I hoped
you could be.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.454
And I'm very proud of you.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.589
Thank you.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.258
So maybe we can try again.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.694
Only if I can do it
the right way, baby.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.928
"The right way"?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.263
We will,
of course, be with you...

20:30.263 --> 20:32.398
Rashad...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.601
You know your knees are bad.

20:34.601 --> 20:38.404
Harper, I'm gonna ask you
a third time.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.872
Will you marry me?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.408
- Yes.
- Yes!

20:42.408 --> 20:43.610
Yes!

20:48.915 --> 20:50.883
I love you.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.719
Oh!

20:53.953 --> 20:57.757
So Monet's just
our fucking boss now.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.792
She made the one move she had.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.527
It was smart.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.896
Forcing her kids to work
for her under penalty of death

21:03.896 --> 21:04.897
is smart?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.599
She's a fucking sociopath.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.867
Does it matter?

21:07.867 --> 21:09.669
We ain't got
nowhere else to go.

21:09.669 --> 21:10.937
Oh, no, I forgot.
He's a fucking mama's boy.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.872
Always has been,
always will be.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.474
If I was you,
I'd shut the fuck up.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.976
I'm so tired
of your fucking bullshit.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.511
Do you even care
that she killed our father?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.579
Enough! Hey!

21:19.579 --> 21:21.280
Stop, okay?

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
This beef ain't between us.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.485
It's Monet again.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.786
She's always
the fucking problem.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.054
Y'all know that.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.392
When will y'all realize
we don't live normal lives?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.328
Seriously.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.930
Dru, I need you
to man the fuck up, okay?

21:37.930 --> 21:40.700
You're not gonna be
a NBA housewife.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.035
And Diana,
let's stop pretending

21:42.035 --> 21:44.404
you're some college
sorority chick, all right?

21:44.404 --> 21:46.305
We're drug dealers.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.907
That's the family business.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.343
That's who we are.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.813
Now, I have
a collection to hit.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.990
You know what?

22:03.990 --> 22:06.025
Fuck both of them.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.327
They're never gonna see us coming.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.597
And by the time they do,
it'll be too fucking late.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.338
Nice of you to join us.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.940
What the fuck
don't you understand

22:20.940 --> 22:22.542
about family emergency?

22:22.542 --> 22:23.543
I'm here now.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.645
My brother is dead, Brayden.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.381
Show some goddamn unity.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.782
I think you guys
should just all

22:29.782 --> 22:31.551
get out of the city
for a while.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.554
You know, avoid all the media,
cops, all that bullshit.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.955
No, Brayden's right.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.458
I can't go out on the street
without being heckled.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.027
Jesus, you're all
thinking about yourselves.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.862
What about a fucking funeral
for Uncle Lucas?

22:42.862 --> 22:43.930
Oh, Becca's right.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.064
What about Uncle Lucas?

22:45.064 --> 22:46.966
No one's even fucking
going to that.

22:46.966 --> 22:47.967
What the fuck?

22:47.967 --> 22:49.135
Mom, Dad, Becca,

22:49.368 --> 22:50.503
<i>you might wanna get
out of here.</i>

22:50.503 --> 22:52.138
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.073
Your family owes
my family money.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.409
I have no idea
who the hell you people are,

22:56.409 --> 22:59.078
<i>but we are not in a position
to repay anybody's losses.</i>

23:01.080 --> 23:02.448
- Cane...
- Listen, man.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.017
You're not
in a fucking position

23:05.017 --> 23:06.385
- to not be in a position.
- Cane...

23:06.385 --> 23:07.954
let's fucking handle this later.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.623
Relax, little man.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.125
Look, everybody
calm the fuck down.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.861
If you don't have the money,
these paintings right here

23:14.861 --> 23:16.095
damn sure don't look fake.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.663
Fucking nice-ass house.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.765
<i>Yeah, check this out, Ma.</i>

23:18.765 --> 23:19.899
This one got your name on it.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.900
Monet.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.168
Yeah, right there.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.636
I'll put this shit up
in the dining room.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.704
<i>Hey...</i>

23:24.704 --> 23:26.172
Let me get that watch, snowflake.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.941
Oh, dude,
it's a family heirloom.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.176
Oh, my God!

23:30.409 --> 23:31.911
- All right.
- All right. Appreciate it.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.013
I'll make sure I let the nigga
at the pawn shop know that.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.717
Hey, all this shit,
it's just a down payment.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.622
We'll be back
for all this shit.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.163
What the fuck, son?

23:50.163 --> 23:52.632
<i>You had every opportunity
to leave that life behind.</i>

23:52.632 --> 23:55.067
You are not one of them.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.670
Yeah, you didn't learn your
fucking lesson the first time?

23:57.670 --> 23:58.938
Me?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.440
Your brother was the biggest
crook in the generation.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.842
You're gonna act like
this is the first time

24:02.842 --> 24:04.177
you suspected anything?

24:04.177 --> 24:05.478
Yeah, okay.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.446
See if the SEC buys
that bullshit.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.948
This fucking family.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.126
- You spoke to your sister?
- Yeah.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.095
Shit that happened to Pops
really fucked them up.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.698
All right?
Dru and Diana might be out.

24:25.698 --> 24:26.966
Nah.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.201
That ain't gonna work for me.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.636
Yeah, well, you gonna
have to work your magic.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.674
When was you gonna tell me
Effie got locked up?

24:34.674 --> 24:36.609
Yeah, Davis told me.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.677
Can I count on you, Cane?

24:37.677 --> 24:39.011
Cause me and you both know

24:39.011 --> 24:40.713
that Tariq is not gonna be able
to handle this shit.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.949
Listen, don't trip
about Effie, all right?

24:42.949 --> 24:44.917
She didn't snitch out Tariq
like I asked her to.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.820
But she held it down.
She kept it 100.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.922
Are you--
nigga, you are pussy whipped.

24:51.557 --> 24:54.794
Can't you see this bitch
is out for herself?

24:54.794 --> 24:56.762
Man, fuck it.
I- I'll handle it on my own.

25:00.566 --> 25:01.934
Fuck.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.204
On the gate.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.282
Why are you changing my cell?

25:16.515 --> 25:19.218
Do I look like I'm here
to answer your questions?

25:28.628 --> 25:32.064
Looks like we got
another bad bitch.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.066
Lights out at nine.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.591
<i>Good, you're here. Look.</i>

25:58.591 --> 25:59.959
From what you told me,
you need to leave

25:59.959 --> 26:01.861
this Monet shit alone,
all right?

26:01.861 --> 26:02.962
She said she didn't do it.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.031
Obviously,
she's gonna fucking lie.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.666
I'm only alive
cause I owe money.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.702
If I may suggest,

26:09.702 --> 26:12.204
when your lawyer
and your homicidal white uncle

26:12.204 --> 26:15.241
both tell you not to start
a war, you should listen.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.243
And we have more pressing shit.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.046
The feds have me on camera
passing a note to Diana.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.581
You gotta get her
charges dropped.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.783
Or else I go down with her.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.284
Trust me, I'm working on that.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.988
What the fuck happened
at Weston Holdings?

26:28.988 --> 26:30.089
You know, I think it was

26:30.089 --> 26:31.357
the fucking
Councilman Tate nigga.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.592
- Shit.
- Yeah.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.829
Okay, I- I'd recommend
not murdering a congressman.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.199
But having leverage on Tate
could be useful.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.834
Oh, you know
that snake-ass motherfucker

26:41.834 --> 26:42.969
is always up for a deal.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.203
That's for damn sure.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.205
I'll take care of that.

26:46.205 --> 26:49.375
And you, my friend,
need to focus on Effie.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.811
She has to go, Tariq.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.212
Whoa, whoa.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.647
Ain't that exactly
what the fuck

26:54.647 --> 26:55.848
you're not supposed to say?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.717
She's not on our side.

26:57.717 --> 27:01.120
If she folds,
we all get jumpsuits.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.955
Didn't she snitch on you
before?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.790
Yes, but it's not that simple.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.026
All right, obviously, the feds
will lock us the fuck up.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.728
But Noma will kill us.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.029
Effie has the picture
that I need

27:10.029 --> 27:11.764
to get out from under
Noma's thumb.

27:11.764 --> 27:15.267
You'll never get to use it
if Lauren testifies,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.937
which reminds me,
she has to go too.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.939
What the fuck are you on
right now, Davis?

27:19.939 --> 27:21.774
You sound like Monet, my nigga.
Stay in your lane.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.309
I don't give a fuck anymore.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.344
Those are your bitches.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.147
Since when is killing
a problem for you?

27:28.147 --> 27:32.218
I learned that killing leads
to more fucking problems.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.086
Listen, I understand
you just lost your brother.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.221
I get exactly how you feel.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.389
I lost my twin sister

27:36.389 --> 27:38.324
right in front
of my fucking eyes, Davis.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.126
But now's not the time
to crash out.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.895
You gotta pull
your shit together.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.097
All right, what if she recants?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.833
What's her incentive?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.101
She gotta feel more in danger

27:49.101 --> 27:50.836
if she testifies
than if she doesn't.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.705
Exactly.

27:52.705 --> 27:56.008
I hear her parents came back
to town after Effie's arrest.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.943
That could be a soft spot.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.312
But recanting won't
outright solve it.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.249
They'd still have time
to trump up some other charges

28:03.249 --> 28:04.750
against Effie.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.186
Unless...

28:08.721 --> 28:10.089
Will Effie talk to you?

28:10.089 --> 28:12.091
Yeah, I think so.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.427
You have to convince her

28:14.427 --> 28:17.096
to do something
she won't wanna do.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.107
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

28:40.286 --> 28:41.487
Hey!

28:41.720 --> 28:44.156
Drop it. Drop it.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.858
Get the fuck off of me!

28:45.858 --> 28:48.060
You're trying
to fucking kill me?

28:50.763 --> 28:52.131
Tougher than I thought.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.401
You have a visitor.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.348
What happened? You okay?

29:09.348 --> 29:11.884
So I can assume it wasn't you
that sent that warning?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.018
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.320
What the fuck
are you here for then?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.022
I got a plan to get you out.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.858
I don't need shit from you.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.226
My lawyer's coming
to sort this out.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.293
I have my own money.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.962
I'm gonna post my own bail.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.164
You know, you can't post bail,
right, Effie?

29:26.332 --> 29:28.067
Nigga, are you crazy?

29:28.067 --> 29:29.135
Are you trying
to get me killed?

29:29.135 --> 29:31.036
Listen, Davis said
if you post bail,

29:31.036 --> 29:32.538
they have months to indict you.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.440
But if you sit, they have
to impanel a whole grand jury

29:34.440 --> 29:35.808
to indict you in five days.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.309
How does less time help me?

29:37.309 --> 29:39.879
Because once they get
the charges dropped,

29:39.879 --> 29:41.814
they'll have less time
to find out anything else.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.015
You'll walk.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.183
Look, we haven't seen
eye to eye,

29:44.183 --> 29:47.052
but we're on the same team, right?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.122
Because you need something
from me?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.126
That picture
of Noma's daughter, yes.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.227
I need it.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.796
If I get it,
figure out who she is,

29:57.796 --> 29:58.864
I'll get you out,

29:58.864 --> 30:00.533
and I'll get us out
from under Noma.

30:00.533 --> 30:03.302
Well, I found her already.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.837
The fuck you mean
you found her?

30:04.837 --> 30:06.472
I found her already.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.874
And you're not getting
a goddamn thing

30:08.874 --> 30:10.476
until you get me
the fuck out of here.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.346
All right,
so they need a grand jury

30:14.346 --> 30:16.015
to indict Effie in five days.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.185
That's our window to get Lauren
a reversal story against Effie.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.220
Effie gets clear, we walk free.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.156
I don't think we got
enough time for that.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.491
I will cut
that fucking hand off.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.194
When did baby Rambo's
balls drop, huh?

30:28.194 --> 30:29.361
<i>Listen, listen, listen.</i>

30:29.361 --> 30:30.429
Only way we get Lauren
to change her story

30:30.429 --> 30:31.463
is if we work together.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.498
So both of y'all
shut the fuck up

30:32.498 --> 30:33.933
and listen, all right?

30:33.933 --> 30:35.134
What you got?

30:35.134 --> 30:37.269
Remember when Obi dropped
pictures of our families?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.038
We're gonna threaten
Lauren's parents?

30:39.038 --> 30:41.941
But just with pictures.
Look, she needs to understand

30:41.941 --> 30:44.510
that even WITSEC can't protect
her and her family, bro.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.478
Look, I'ma set up
a meeting with us.

30:46.478 --> 30:47.513
You guys talk to her.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.981
You guys show her the pictures.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.249
We promise her safety

30:50.249 --> 30:52.985
in return for her recanting
her story on Effie.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.587
Dru and I will get the photos.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.989
Bet. I'll have Davis
show y'all where to get them.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.124
Just tell me
when you wanna leave.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.226
I swear to God--

31:00.226 --> 31:01.393
Yo, yo, yo,
shut the fuck up, man.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.895
We got shit to do.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.877
You better have a damn good
reason for calling.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.046
Lauren, listen.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.249
You can't testify, all right?
It's not safe.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.950
So someone's gonna kill me?

31:24.950 --> 31:26.218
The same way you killed Saxe

31:26.218 --> 31:28.020
after I told you
he was talking to Jenny?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.521
That wasn't me.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.290
All right?
Saxe was dirty as fuck.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.525
<i>He dug his grave
100 times over.</i>

31:33.525 --> 31:35.261
How do you even trust the feds?

31:35.261 --> 31:36.528
They can't even keep
their own people safe.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.297
<i>They don't even let you see
your family.</i>

31:38.297 --> 31:39.531
<i>Come on, listen.</i>

31:39.531 --> 31:40.532
<i>I'm the only person
that can help you</i>

31:40.532 --> 31:42.067
<i>in your situation, all right?</i>

31:42.067 --> 31:44.603
And how am I supposed
to trust that?

31:44.603 --> 31:46.205
If I wanted to hurt you,
you've given me

31:46.205 --> 31:48.574
the opportunity to do so
a million times already.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.476
<i>Just trust me.
I got a plan.</i>

31:50.476 --> 31:52.044
<i>Meet up with me,
and we'll speak about it.</i>

31:52.044 --> 31:53.545
<i>Please.</i>

31:55.981 --> 31:59.218
Okay, but it needs to be
in public.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.387
I'll meet you tonight
in Fort Greene Park.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.088
All right, I'll be there.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.523
Thank you.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.306
<i>I know.</i>

32:20.306 --> 32:22.241
We have to keep trying.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.409
I--

32:24.943 --> 32:26.211
Sterling?

32:27.379 --> 32:29.081
Let me call you back.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.220
We need you
to quiet the fuck down,

32:35.220 --> 32:36.388
Mrs. Baldwin.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.164
Honestly, don't trip,
all right?

32:45.164 --> 32:46.532
She lives.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.967
Hey, light skin.
Nice to see you again.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.002
You fucking tricked me?

32:50.002 --> 32:52.237
Lauren, you're not
in any danger.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.139
I tried to save you, remember?

32:54.139 --> 32:56.108
Did you?
Look, I don't care.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.976
I will fuck all y'all up
before I go down.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.345
Look, they're just here
to make a deal.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.180
Face to face so you know
that they're telling the truth.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.381
<i>That's it.</i>

33:02.381 --> 33:04.183
I wouldn't be scared
of the undynamic duo,

33:04.183 --> 33:06.118
but what I would
be scared of...

33:07.653 --> 33:08.721
Is me.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.656
My mom and dad? Really?

33:10.656 --> 33:12.324
What? Cane, what the fuck?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.592
We never spoke about this shit.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.694
- Let them go right now.
- Or what, huh?

33:15.694 --> 33:19.131
You'll slightly puncture me
with a fucking steak knife?

33:19.131 --> 33:22.000
Listen, I don't listen
to this nigga, okay?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.602
I listen to myself, all right?

33:23.602 --> 33:26.138
Now, if I give you my word,
it's bond.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.774
Recant,
forget I fucking know you.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.476
Yeah, you go about
your regular life.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.711
School, family,
back to the future

33:32.711 --> 33:34.513
<i>that you've been
preparing for.</i>

33:34.513 --> 33:36.715
I mean, what, you wanna be
in bum fuck Arizona

33:36.715 --> 33:38.217
being a cashier?

33:38.217 --> 33:40.119
That's all WITSEC has for you,
Lauren, literally.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.088
And what about Effie?

33:43.088 --> 33:44.790
Is she in on this deal?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.291
That's who tried
to fucking kill me.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.726
And I'm gonna need
guarantee from that bitch

33:47.726 --> 33:49.194
before I do shit.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.130
But I swear to God,
if something happens

33:51.130 --> 33:52.564
to my family, it is over.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.033
Listen, let her parents go.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.235
Show her she can trust us.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.669
<i>- Come on.</i>
- Cane.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.373
All right.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.642
But remember, we always know
where to find them.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.447
Jenny and Blanca were right,
weren't they?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.549
The drugs, murders,
it all comes back to you.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.650
No, listen,
it wasn't supposed--

34:11.650 --> 34:14.186
Don't!

34:14.186 --> 34:16.388
This is the last time
you lie to me.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.261
Fuck.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.263
I mean,
even if this shit does work,

34:24.263 --> 34:27.332
we still gotta worry about
the charges against Diana, no?

34:27.332 --> 34:29.268
You got Davis handling
that shit, right?

34:29.268 --> 34:30.369
Yeah.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.603
Right now, in fact.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.105
<i>♪ I'm all the way up ♪</i>

34:34.673 --> 34:37.109
<i>♪ All the way up
All the way up ♪</i>

34:39.244 --> 34:42.381
I just received
the call from AVH.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.316
She's officially conceded
the race.

34:48.854 --> 34:53.659
I'm happy tonight
that virtue and integrity won.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.860
And I couldn't have done it

34:55.093 --> 34:57.296
without my extraordinary staff:

34:57.296 --> 35:00.599
Brushaundria, Jim, Sabrina,

35:00.599 --> 35:03.101
I couldn't have done it
without all of your support.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.137
But mostly,
I couldn't have done it

35:05.137 --> 35:07.139
without the guidance

35:07.139 --> 35:09.475
from my lovely fiancée, Harper.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.510
Come on. Come on up.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.248
- I love you.
- I love you too.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.749
And remember,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.384
New York still leads the way.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.286
New York leads the way.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.721
New York leads the way!

35:29.228 --> 35:30.429
I'm proud of you.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.698
Thank you. Thank you.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.235
I appreciate you.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.769
What's happening, nigga?

35:37.769 --> 35:40.272
Or shall I say congratulations,
Congressman?

35:40.272 --> 35:43.442
Ah, Davis, I didn't realize
that you were a supporter.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.210
I'm not.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.346
But I have a message for you.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.780
Shall we?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.883
Thank you for
going out to those polls and...

35:50.883 --> 35:52.718
Tariq and the Tejadas know
it was you

35:52.718 --> 35:54.720
who burned them
at Weston Holdings.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.756
You've got a bullet
coming your way.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.260
Are you sure you wanna
threaten me, my nigga?

36:01.260 --> 36:02.561
Cause after tonight,
I can have your ass

36:02.561 --> 36:04.830
chasing after fucking
ambulances in Trenton.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.466
Now who's threatening who?

36:07.466 --> 36:10.702
There's something you can do
that might earn you some grace.

36:10.702 --> 36:14.439
Get that charges
against Diana Tejada dropped,

36:14.439 --> 36:17.175
and make sure
they back off me as well.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.179
Look at your ass.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.347
Mm-mm.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.582
But you know,

36:23.582 --> 36:26.285
I'm always open
to helping friends in need,

36:26.285 --> 36:27.686
particularly when they donate

36:27.686 --> 36:31.189
large sums of money
to my campaign.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.425
Of course.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.726
Consider it done.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.931
<i>And drink!</i>

36:38.931 --> 36:40.832
Professor Bennet,
I was just looking for you.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.301
Amina Hosseini of <i>The Tribune.</i>

36:42.301 --> 36:43.535
Now's not a good time.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.305
I would love to run a piece
on your love story

36:46.305 --> 36:47.673
with Rashad Tate.

36:47.673 --> 36:51.977
Old flames reuniting
during the campaign.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.646
Well, it would be about
the end of a love story,

36:54.646 --> 36:56.415
a real fucking tragedy.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.383
And nobody wants to read that.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.552
So if you'll excuse me.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.302
Brayden?

37:17.302 --> 37:18.804
Hey.

37:20.772 --> 37:21.974
What are you doing here?

37:21.974 --> 37:24.343
Just getting my shit
out of here.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.612
It's my last day
at Weston Holdings, so...

37:26.612 --> 37:28.814
SEC just cleared me.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.716
You know, they also wanted
to talk to RSJ,

37:30.716 --> 37:32.684
but conveniently,
he's out of the country.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.952
Guess that's one of the perks

37:33.952 --> 37:35.687
of having your own private jet.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.623
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna be stuck on coach

37:37.623 --> 37:39.791
on the way back home
to Columbus, so...

37:39.791 --> 37:41.360
You don't have to go.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.628
Lucas took the blame
for everything

37:42.628 --> 37:43.996
in his suicide note.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.931
Yeah, but that doesn't change
the fact

37:45.931 --> 37:47.633
that I know I was a part of it.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.668
I gotta take a step back.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.536
You know, look at my life.

37:51.536 --> 37:52.804
Start over.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.906
At least you get to.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.709
Brayden, you know how you said

37:57.709 --> 38:00.479
that you were gonna make
all of this go away?

38:00.479 --> 38:02.614
Your uncle wasn't a quitter.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.819
I mean, I- I told you
where he was hiding.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.321
That suicide note,

38:09.321 --> 38:11.356
it- it didn't sound
anything like him.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.063
What are you asking me?

38:19.931 --> 38:21.500
Maybe...

38:21.500 --> 38:23.635
maybe you need
to get out of here too.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.870
I mean, seriously.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.905
Think about
what you're becoming.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.343
It's a little late for that.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.561
- I'm not an idiot.
- I know.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.097
Okay, so this isn't about
getting justice for me.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.766
This is about you trying
to get Effie to turn on Tariq

38:54.766 --> 38:56.334
and bring down
some big drug ring

38:56.334 --> 38:58.470
while you get justice
for your dead boyfriend

38:58.470 --> 38:59.838
and maybe a promotion.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.841
That's what I thought.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.976
Look, at this point,
I want Tariq gone, too,

39:04.976 --> 39:06.078
but what I'm not gonna do

39:06.078 --> 39:07.913
is get up on that stand
and lie for you.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.981
So if you want Effie
to flip on Tariq,

39:09.981 --> 39:12.017
let me talk to her.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.120
Well, what makes you think
you can get Effie to flip?

39:15.353 --> 39:16.855
Because I can tell her
she has no reason

39:16.855 --> 39:18.023
to stay loyal to him.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.591
What do you mean?

39:19.591 --> 39:21.460
Tariq wants her
to keep her mouth shut

39:21.460 --> 39:23.128
and go away
so he can be with me.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.097
Have you been in contact
with Tariq?

39:25.097 --> 39:26.465
<i>Did he tell you that?</i>

39:26.465 --> 39:27.966
Of course not.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.534
But she doesn't know that.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.973
Lauren, I've crossed
so many ethical lines already,

39:34.973 --> 39:37.142
I- I can't ask you to do that.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.677
Jenny, you have no choice.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.546
Either I talk to Effie
or I'm not gonna testify.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.881
<i>And then what?</i>

39:50.989 --> 39:52.958
Too much of a fair fight
last time?

40:00.432 --> 40:04.603
<i>♪ I take my time
I finesse it, yeah ♪</i>

40:04.603 --> 40:09.474
<i>♪ Can't get you
Out of the question, no ♪</i>

40:09.474 --> 40:10.942
<i>♪ I keep falling... ♪</i>

40:10.942 --> 40:13.879
You two play nice now.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.448
<i>♪ Give me
All my messages ♪</i>

40:18.917 --> 40:20.452
This isn't being recorded.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.788
I learned my lesson
about that shit.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.957
<i>The past few months of my life
have been fucking hell.</i>

40:25.957 --> 40:27.859
Do you understand that?

40:27.859 --> 40:29.995
<i>And whatever it is
that you're into,</i>

40:29.995 --> 40:31.963
I'm not a part of it.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.732
Apparently,
Tariq didn't want me dead,

40:33.732 --> 40:36.067
and neither did Brayden.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.736
But the cops showed me pictures
of you two.

40:37.736 --> 40:38.837
So what was that?

40:38.837 --> 40:40.005
You were just trying
to get rid of me?

40:41.173 --> 40:42.808
You're thinking
way too deep into this.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.776
So then what do I need to know?

40:44.776 --> 40:47.546
Because if I'm not 100% sure
that this shit is over,

40:47.546 --> 40:49.815
I have no problem
taking you guys down with me.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.117
Lauren...

40:52.117 --> 40:54.719
I don't give a fuck about you.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.121
Not one.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.624
You say the last couple months
of your life have been hard.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.226
Try since fucking birth.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.095
You've had every single
golden opportunity in the world

41:04.095 --> 41:05.964
and I was never jealous
of that.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.566
But you decided to step out

41:07.566 --> 41:09.968
of your wide-ass,
privileged-ass lane,

41:09.968 --> 41:12.103
and you threatened my future.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.706
You see, this was never
personal, Lauren.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.209
This was just business.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.078
But if you go up there
and you snitch me out,

41:20.078 --> 41:22.647
I'm afraid this is gonna
get personal really quickly.

41:22.647 --> 41:23.682
Are you threatening me?

41:23.682 --> 41:24.883
No, I'm telling you the truth.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.051
Well, I think
you're very confused

41:26.051 --> 41:27.719
on who has the power
in this situation.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.054
- Mm.
- <i>You know what?</i>

41:29.054 --> 41:31.056
I'm not the same Lauren
I used to be.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.492
I didn't see you coming
last time,

41:34.492 --> 41:36.161
but this time,
my eyes are wide open, bitch.

41:36.161 --> 41:40.265
Look, if you recant,
we all walk.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.566
You get your old life back.

41:41.566 --> 41:42.801
We all get our old lives back.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.203
- That's what you want.
- Jesus, you're evil.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.572
All of you are fucking evil.

41:47.572 --> 41:48.740
And somehow, you think

41:48.740 --> 41:50.141
you don't deserve
what you're getting.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.689
Members of the grand jury,
you're here to decide

42:04.689 --> 42:06.591
whether or not
there is sufficient evidence

42:06.591 --> 42:08.293
to indict Josefina Morales

42:08.526 --> 42:10.195
for the felony
of attempted murder.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.730
And to help you make
that decision,

42:11.730 --> 42:13.865
you'll now hear
from the victim in the case,

42:13.865 --> 42:15.533
Lauren Baldwin,

42:15.533 --> 42:19.571
a dean's list student
at Stansfield University.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.306
Miss Baldwin,
would you tell the grand jury

42:21.539 --> 42:23.541
what happened to you?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.181
I know you've
been through a lot.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.818
In a signed victim statement,

42:33.818 --> 42:35.854
you stated that
Miss Morales kidnapped you,

42:35.854 --> 42:38.323
<i>knocked you unconscious,
strapped you to your seat,</i>

42:38.556 --> 42:40.992
and pushed you
into an icy river.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.061
Yes.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.297
That is what you told me
to say.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.003
Lauren,
you signed this statement

42:52.003 --> 42:53.271
under penalty of perjury.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.140
Because you forced me to.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.910
I wasn't well.

42:58.910 --> 43:03.148
I was having panic attacks
over school

43:03.148 --> 43:06.017
and, um, you know,
just the pressure.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.953
<i>I don't--I don't know.</i>

43:07.953 --> 43:10.055
And I took a drive,

43:10.055 --> 43:11.756
and I...

43:11.756 --> 43:13.091
I'm sorry.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.694
I started thinking
about my brother,

43:15.694 --> 43:18.096
who also has panic attacks
and anxiety,

43:18.096 --> 43:21.833
and I must have just
blacked out in my car.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.735
When I woke up,
Jenny Sullivan was in the room

43:23.735 --> 43:26.705
with a doctor that told me
that I was dead.

43:26.705 --> 43:29.708
And she told me if I ever wanna
see my parents again,

43:29.708 --> 43:32.644
I have to say it was Effie
who did this to me.

43:32.644 --> 43:34.913
It is obvious that this witness
has been compromised.

43:34.913 --> 43:36.114
Lauren, are you aware

43:36.114 --> 43:37.782
that you are perjuring yourself
right now?

43:37.782 --> 43:40.318
I was so confused,
as you can imagine.

43:40.318 --> 43:44.155
But she made me believe
that this statement was true.

43:44.155 --> 43:46.124
<i>But it's not.</i>

43:48.727 --> 43:49.861
Sorry, Jenny.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.097
I'm done with your agenda.

43:52.097 --> 43:53.932
I'd like to go home.

44:00.705 --> 44:01.906
What happened?

44:01.906 --> 44:03.975
I don't know how they
got to her, but they did.

44:05.176 --> 44:06.911
We still have Effie in custody.

44:06.911 --> 44:08.146
And you only have a day left
to charge her

44:08.146 --> 44:09.414
before you have to let her go.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.816
And we got nothing
from busting the coffee shop.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.151
They played you.

44:14.319 --> 44:15.387
I'm pulling the plug

44:15.387 --> 44:16.988
before we're embarrassed
any further.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.024
No.
Medina, after all this time,

44:19.024 --> 44:20.058
you know the St. Patricks.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.292
There is a way to save this.

44:21.292 --> 44:23.428
Yeah, pack it up.
Piss on the fire.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.896
This is done.

44:50.955 --> 44:52.223
Are you okay, honey?

44:52.223 --> 44:54.993
Yeah, just really ready to go.

44:54.993 --> 44:57.062
Let's go, baby.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.196
Thank you.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.118
I don't know how you do
this shit all the time,

45:20.118 --> 45:22.053
but you just do.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.988
You just gotta have
a little faith.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.857
Yeah, I didn't have
any other options.

45:25.857 --> 45:28.827
Anyway, as agreed,

45:28.827 --> 45:31.763
turns out Noma's daughter
isn't even a kid anymore.

45:31.763 --> 45:34.966
She's our age,
and she's attending NYU.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.068
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:37.068 --> 45:41.172
This is the name, address,
social media so you can track.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.373
I don't even think
that she knows

45:42.373 --> 45:44.476
that her mom is a criminal.

45:44.476 --> 45:47.412
It's like Noma kept their lives
completely separate.

45:48.847 --> 45:53.151
So um, what happens to me and
this business after you do this?

45:54.953 --> 45:57.322
I mean, you've been on your own
before, right?

45:57.322 --> 45:59.290
I'm sure you can build back up.

46:01.493 --> 46:02.894
Just like that?

46:02.894 --> 46:05.163
After you set me up
at the warehouse.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.764
We're not even now?

46:06.764 --> 46:08.166
All the shit that you said
in Italy,

46:08.166 --> 46:10.869
was that--
that was just nothing?

46:10.869 --> 46:12.770
What about our future?

46:15.306 --> 46:17.842
Effie, tell me why you think
I can trust you.

46:17.842 --> 46:21.479
You went behind my back to Cane
when you should've came to me.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.948
But I'm not tripping.
It's all good.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.283
Let me take you to your dorm.
Come on.

46:32.023 --> 46:33.958
Yo, what are you doing?

46:33.958 --> 46:36.494
Finding my own way,
like I always do.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.534
A'ight, look. Noma's daughter.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.002
That's the key to our freedom.

46:44.002 --> 46:45.870
She'll stop the fucking threats
to our families,

46:45.870 --> 46:47.272
and we won't have to work
for Monet.

46:49.340 --> 46:51.176
Listen, 'Riq,
I don't know if I can.

46:51.176 --> 46:52.410
If you can what?

46:52.410 --> 46:53.511
Ride with you on this.

46:53.511 --> 46:54.879
Look, for me, I just--

46:54.879 --> 46:56.147
I think it's just time to quit.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.582
Cold turkey.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.484
Look, if you can use that
to get me out, cool.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.186
- Wait, wait, you--
- But if it's my head

47:01.186 --> 47:02.987
that Noma or the Tejadas
come for, then--

47:02.987 --> 47:05.290
You waited for this shit to get
this fucking hard to quit, B?

47:05.290 --> 47:07.292
And then you leave me with
the bag to hold for myself.

47:07.292 --> 47:09.127
I killed my fucking uncle, okay?

47:09.127 --> 47:10.361
He didn't jump. I pushed him.

47:10.361 --> 47:11.930
You did what needed to be done, Brayden.

47:11.930 --> 47:14.299
Yeah, and it's all
I can fucking think about.

47:14.299 --> 47:16.234
My family will never
be the same.

47:16.234 --> 47:18.436
We ruin people's lives, 'Riq.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.438
I'm just...

47:20.438 --> 47:22.440
I'm not made for it.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.309
- I'm sorry, but--
- Come the fuck on, bro.

47:24.309 --> 47:25.343
Come the fuck on.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.978
I'm sorry. I'm out.

47:28.413 --> 47:29.380
<i>Good luck.</i>

47:31.449 --> 47:32.850
Fuck!

47:39.524 --> 47:40.491
Yo, what's up?

47:40.491 --> 47:42.093
I need to talk to you, 'Riq.

47:42.093 --> 47:44.963
It's about my mom and my dad.

47:44.963 --> 47:46.331
Yeah, she told me.

47:46.331 --> 47:47.966
She thinks I'm how you
found out she killed him,

47:47.966 --> 47:50.235
but I had no idea.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.569
Shit's so fucked up.

47:53.538 --> 47:54.606
I know.

47:54.606 --> 47:56.007
But look, 'Riq,

47:56.007 --> 47:58.276
I gotta get out,
but she'll never let me leave.

47:58.276 --> 48:00.545
She's fucking crazy,
and honestly, I'm scared.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.380
Yeah, I feel you.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.949
I mean, can you believe
she sent Tommy after my mother?

48:04.949 --> 48:06.951
Is she okay?

48:06.951 --> 48:08.486
She's fine.

48:08.486 --> 48:10.121
Tommy said they hashed it out.

48:10.121 --> 48:11.489
If she went after your mom
like that,

48:11.489 --> 48:12.957
how is Monet still alive?

48:12.957 --> 48:13.992
That don't make sense.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.526
Look, because my mom

48:15.526 --> 48:16.661
is still alive, all right?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.429
And that's a win for me.

48:18.429 --> 48:20.898
I don't need no fucking war
between me and your family, D.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.634
That's just gonna end up
with my family

48:22.634 --> 48:24.402
having to go
on the fucking run again.

48:24.402 --> 48:27.372
Fucking Monet.

48:27.372 --> 48:28.373
Fuck.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.678
Okay, look.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.346
What if it didn't start a war?

48:36.447 --> 48:37.982
How is that gonna happen?

48:37.982 --> 48:39.684
Dru hates her,
and I want her ass dead

48:39.917 --> 48:42.287
for what she did to my father.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.989
It's time for Monet to go.

48:44.989 --> 48:46.190
I mean, do you really think

48:46.190 --> 48:48.393
you can ever be free
while she's still alive?

48:48.393 --> 48:50.295
She sent someone
to kill your mother.

48:50.295 --> 48:51.562
You think she won't do that
again?

48:51.562 --> 48:53.031
D, what are you asking me
right now?

48:53.031 --> 48:54.999
I'm asking you to help me.

48:54.999 --> 48:56.234
What about Cane?

48:56.234 --> 48:57.535
Cane will never know.

48:57.535 --> 48:58.536
But we gotta move fast.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.138
We only get one shot.

49:03.074 --> 49:04.976
All right, I'm in.
What do we do?

49:04.976 --> 49:07.378
She's been trying to get me
to come over and talk.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.080
<i>I'll pick her up
from the house</i>

49:09.080 --> 49:10.548
<i>and tell her Dru's waiting
at the penthouse</i>

49:10.548 --> 49:12.450
<i>to hash things out.</i>

49:12.450 --> 49:15.353
<i>I'll pull up right
to where you'll be hiding.</i>

49:15.353 --> 49:18.356
<i>Put two through the window
and drive off.</i>

49:18.356 --> 49:21.592
<i>I'll tell Dru and Cane
I never saw the killer's face.</i>

49:23.961 --> 49:26.331
So you ain't got nothing to say
until we meet up with Dru?

49:31.636 --> 49:32.970
<i>This is some bullshit.</i>

49:32.970 --> 49:34.238
You out here causing drama
when it's finally

49:34.238 --> 49:35.506
your turn to step up
for this family.

49:35.506 --> 49:36.574
Family?

49:36.574 --> 49:38.343
This ain't a fucking family, Monet.

49:38.343 --> 49:39.711
This is a business.

49:39.711 --> 49:41.112
You killed our father.

49:41.112 --> 49:42.980
What kind of mother does that
to her children?

49:44.115 --> 49:46.184
You're right, D. You're right.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.419
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.022
When I had to give Zeke up,

49:51.022 --> 49:53.558
it took something out of me.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.227
I couldn't be soft on you kids.

49:58.429 --> 49:59.764
Dealing was Lorenzo's hustle.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.200
We raised y'all like soldiers,

50:02.200 --> 50:04.135
and it was easier
to see you that way.

50:05.436 --> 50:07.271
Easier to protect you
from the fucked up way

50:07.271 --> 50:09.273
these streets treat you.

50:09.273 --> 50:13.044
Now, I know that's not right,
D, but that's who we were.

50:13.044 --> 50:14.345
Now, you put all this on me,

50:14.345 --> 50:16.647
but what about Lorenzo's hand
in raising you?

50:16.647 --> 50:20.084
He chose this life for us,
not me.

50:20.084 --> 50:21.652
I'm tough on y'all.

50:21.652 --> 50:25.590
Especially you,
because I love you.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.127
And I'm sorry.

50:29.127 --> 50:31.763
I don't know any other way
to show it.

50:35.133 --> 50:36.801
You still ain't got nothing
to say?

50:37.034 --> 50:38.736
Ma, I left something
in the house.

50:38.736 --> 50:39.804
Let- let's go back inside--

50:42.373 --> 50:43.608
Ahh!

50:54.152 --> 50:55.119
Ma.

51:01.325 --> 51:03.394
<i>Ma. Diana.</i>

51:07.231 --> 51:08.533
Oh, fuck.

51:17.575 --> 51:21.179
She's still in surgery.
She's in critical condition.

51:21.179 --> 51:24.649
I wish I had better news,
but uh, it's touch and go.

51:28.119 --> 51:30.488
She sacrificed herself
to save me.

51:39.197 --> 51:40.832
Did you see who did this?

51:44.535 --> 51:45.603
It was Tariq.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.372
<i>Tariq?</i>

51:48.372 --> 51:51.476
He thinks Monet sent Tommy
after his mom.

51:51.476 --> 51:53.644
He's looking for payback.

51:53.644 --> 51:55.313
I'm gonna kill him.

51:55.313 --> 51:58.216
Cane, we don't even know
if Ma is gonna be okay.

51:58.216 --> 52:00.518
Cane, you can't--
we have to stick together.

52:00.518 --> 52:01.552
You hear me?

52:01.552 --> 52:03.221
I'ma kill him.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.622
Tariq gotta go.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.533
Ma, you took our father
from us!

52:15.533 --> 52:16.601
You killed him!

52:16.601 --> 52:17.902
Get the fuck off her.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.304
Don't you ever put your
fucking hands on me again.

52:20.304 --> 52:21.439
Cane!

52:23.274 --> 52:24.275
Yo, yo, wait, wait.

52:24.275 --> 52:25.843
Hold up. Hold up.

52:25.843 --> 52:27.411
She killed our father.

52:27.411 --> 52:28.813
She can't get away with that.

52:28.813 --> 52:31.582
She put Gordo up to it
and had me kill him.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.851
It's either her or us.

52:33.851 --> 52:36.320
We gotta cover our tracks
if we gonna do this.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.656
Then we do exactly
what Monet did to Papi.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.391
We can't do it ourselves.

52:40.391 --> 52:42.527
We use Tariq.

52:42.527 --> 52:44.462
There's no way
Tariq gets out of this alive.

52:44.462 --> 52:45.830
You know Cane will want blood.

52:45.830 --> 52:48.432
- So be it.
- What? No.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.767
- That doesn't sound--
- Diana, we are fighting

52:49.767 --> 52:51.402
for our fucking lives.

52:51.402 --> 52:52.904
Tariq kills Monet.

52:52.904 --> 52:55.540
Cane kills Tariq.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.675
What the fuck, Diana?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.577
You were supposed to hit
'Riq's car

52:59.577 --> 53:02.513
so Cane could take him out
right there.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.516
I don't know
if Tariq is the shooter.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.785
Someone else fucked up
the plan, Dru.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.320
I don't know who.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.690
<i>Tariq ain't stupid, Dru.</i>

53:12.690 --> 53:14.559
Just gotta motivate him.

53:15.626 --> 53:16.627
I still have that letter

53:16.627 --> 53:17.795
that Saxe sent Monet.

53:17.795 --> 53:19.430
<i>We can use that.</i>

53:26.370 --> 53:27.505
You can't serve me.

53:27.505 --> 53:29.407
You didn't even ask
my fucking name.

53:29.407 --> 53:30.575
Scram.

53:30.575 --> 53:31.742
Tell Tommy this is a gift

53:31.742 --> 53:33.411
from Monet Tejada.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.483
- <i>We stick to our story.</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

53:39.483 --> 53:41.786
- I don't--
- We stick to our fucking story.

53:41.786 --> 53:43.754
It was Tariq.

53:52.663 --> 53:54.999
<i>Ma, I'm so glad you called.</i>

53:55.232 --> 53:58.002
Tommy told you
not to go after her, Tariq.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.470
What were you doing there?

53:59.470 --> 54:00.771
Listen, Ma.
Diana was in on it, okay?

54:00.771 --> 54:02.273
there wasn't gonna be
any retaliation.

54:02.273 --> 54:04.542
Monet was my mark. Not yours.

54:04.542 --> 54:05.676
I'm your mother. I protect you.

54:05.676 --> 54:06.811
Oh, that's why
you knocked me out.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.813
Hell, yeah,
and I'd do it again.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.248
Listen.

54:11.248 --> 54:14.285
Even if Monet survives,
your hands are clean.

54:14.285 --> 54:15.953
I mean, I'm going back
to Yas and Big Mama.

54:15.953 --> 54:17.788
You are going back to school.

54:17.788 --> 54:20.358
You get your trust,
and then you get out, baby.

54:20.358 --> 54:22.460
Then we can all be together again.

54:24.629 --> 54:25.930
Ma, I fucked up.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.531
What you mean?

54:30.468 --> 54:31.535
My- my trust fund is gone,
all right?

54:31.535 --> 54:33.504
I lost it in a Ponzi scheme.

54:33.504 --> 54:35.573
What the--boy!

54:35.573 --> 54:37.475
W-was it that Weston shit?

54:38.442 --> 54:39.477
Damn, 'Riq.

54:39.477 --> 54:40.678
What now?

54:40.678 --> 54:41.912
I don't know.

54:41.912 --> 54:43.848
I mean, I thought
I was only escaping Noma.

54:43.848 --> 54:45.416
Wait, who the fuck is Noma?

54:46.050 --> 54:48.019
All right, Noma
is Mecca's boss, all right?

54:48.019 --> 54:49.420
She found out
Mecca was killed.

54:49.420 --> 54:50.755
She came here
looking for Mecca's killers,

54:50.755 --> 54:52.890
and now we've been trying
to fill in his role ever since.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.859
Or you pay with your life.

54:54.859 --> 54:56.861
Tariq, what have you
gotten yourself into?

54:56.861 --> 54:58.829
I mean, it's nothing
I can't figure out.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.798
Look, I just need money.
You know? That power.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.667
That power that makes you
literally untouchable.

55:02.667 --> 55:03.901
That shit that Noma has.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.970
Your dad tried that,

55:05.970 --> 55:07.471
and it took him down.

55:07.471 --> 55:09.073
Yeah, but you know he didn't
do that shit right, Ma.

55:09.306 --> 55:11.308
No, no, no.
Ghost was a lot of things,

55:11.308 --> 55:12.610
but he wasn't stupid.

55:13.911 --> 55:15.913
All right, but I learned
from his mistakes, all right?

55:15.913 --> 55:17.314
They're lessons for me.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.586
All right. There's a way.

55:22.586 --> 55:24.755
But if you take it,
you cannot stop.

55:24.755 --> 55:26.057
You understand?

55:26.057 --> 55:28.359
With Monet shot,
it's a power vacuum.

55:28.359 --> 55:29.560
I cleared the way.

55:29.560 --> 55:30.995
You just need to use it

55:30.995 --> 55:32.763
to get close to Noma
and try to--

55:32.763 --> 55:34.565
Learn everything she knows

55:34.565 --> 55:36.100
so I can end up taking
everything she has

55:36.333 --> 55:37.368
and bringing you home.

55:37.368 --> 55:39.570
But it's a dangerous play, baby.

55:39.570 --> 55:41.372
You gotta be careful.

55:41.372 --> 55:44.709
Yeah, I know,
but I'm not gonna get you back

55:44.709 --> 55:47.044
and have a life worth living
without taking a risk.

55:47.044 --> 55:49.346
You know?

55:49.346 --> 55:51.549
'Riq, come on.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.656
Just be careful, please.

56:01.659 --> 56:02.960
I got this, Ma.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.464
I hope so.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.935
I hope so.

56:16.841 --> 56:17.908
<i>Junior.</i>

56:18.976 --> 56:20.377
<i>Mom?</i>

56:22.813 --> 56:24.615
What are you--
what are you doing here?

56:24.615 --> 56:26.684
You haven't been home.

56:26.684 --> 56:27.985
Sorry.

56:27.985 --> 56:30.788
Uh, our witness recanted,
and the case blew up.

56:30.788 --> 56:33.124
I'm sorry.

56:33.124 --> 56:34.425
But you're still young,

56:34.425 --> 56:36.627
and it'll only make you stronger.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.062
You've heard me say it before,

56:38.062 --> 56:41.132
but I am so proud that you
followed in Angela's footsteps.

56:41.132 --> 56:42.466
Yeah, I know.

56:42.466 --> 56:44.969
And Angela
would be proud too.

56:44.969 --> 56:48.839
Um, this uh, came for you
in the mail.

56:51.509 --> 56:53.978
It's from that lawyer,
Cooper Saxe.

57:05.890 --> 57:07.725
And then there was one.

57:07.725 --> 57:09.093
Arms up.

57:09.093 --> 57:11.028
It's in my waist.

57:11.028 --> 57:12.463
Mm.

57:12.463 --> 57:15.533
I see we are all being
more cautious these days.

57:15.533 --> 57:17.101
Follow me.

57:25.743 --> 57:27.611
Obi says you have
a proposition.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.580
Yes, I do.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.916
I wanna work alongside you
so I can elevate.

57:31.916 --> 57:34.485
Once you guys expand,
I can run shit right here.

57:34.485 --> 57:36.821
Bold of you to make demands
after a hit on Monet.

57:36.821 --> 57:40.024
I hear whoever it was
didn't finish the job.

57:40.024 --> 57:41.759
Did you have anything
to do with it?

57:41.759 --> 57:43.727
Nah, that wasn't me.

57:43.727 --> 57:45.996
There seem to be differing
opinions on the matter.

57:45.996 --> 57:47.731
What the fuck
are you talking about?

57:51.936 --> 57:53.637
Thought you got away with it, motherfucker?

57:53.637 --> 57:55.706
- With what?
- <i>Diana saw you, Tariq.</i>

57:55.706 --> 57:57.775
You tried to kill our mother.

57:57.775 --> 57:58.909
D, what the fuck
are they talking about?

57:58.909 --> 57:59.910
Tell them what happened.

57:59.910 --> 58:01.011
You almost killed me too.

58:05.216 --> 58:07.918
- Anya Covington.
- Wait, Cane.

58:07.918 --> 58:09.486
Tariq, what did you just say?

58:09.486 --> 58:10.821
Anya Covington.

58:10.821 --> 58:12.056
Yes, your daughter.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.524
I got people with eyes on her.

58:13.524 --> 58:15.593
I promise you
if anything happens to me

58:15.593 --> 58:17.094
or my family ever,

58:17.094 --> 58:19.530
I'll send them people
right after your daughter.

58:19.530 --> 58:20.631
Clever boy.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.233
Never without a plan, are you?

58:22.233 --> 58:25.502
But perhaps you've flown
too close to the sun, love.

58:25.502 --> 58:26.770
<i>Yo, what the fuck,
Effie?</i>

58:26.770 --> 58:28.639
- I'm so sorry, Tariq.
- What the fuck did you do?

58:28.639 --> 58:30.608
I told Noma that you were
threatening her daughter.

58:30.608 --> 58:32.776
<i>We're working together,
and I have a future with her,</i>

58:32.776 --> 58:34.278
so I couldn't let that happen.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.646
This bitch.

58:35.646 --> 58:36.747
Now thanks to Effie,

58:36.747 --> 58:38.082
I've moved my daughter
to safety.

58:39.984 --> 58:42.186
I've been wanting to do this
for a long time.

58:47.992 --> 58:49.593
Get your ass down!

59:06.911 --> 59:09.647
I think I took one
of those fuckers out!

59:14.852 --> 59:16.120
Yo, B, what the fuck?
How did you know?

59:16.120 --> 59:17.588
Obi called me.

59:17.588 --> 59:19.690
He said he owed you.
Something about green cards.

59:19.690 --> 59:21.058
He said they were gonna
fucking clip you.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.226
I thought you was out, man.

59:22.226 --> 59:23.594
Nah, I couldn't leave you
hanging like that.

59:23.594 --> 59:24.695
Are you fucking kidding me?

59:24.695 --> 59:25.996
What do we do now?

59:27.197 --> 59:28.632
Man, I don't know.

59:28.632 --> 59:30.668
I think we just started
a fucking war, though.

59:36.774 --> 59:39.243
<i>♪ Is you ready for war
My brother ♪</i>

59:40.778 --> 59:42.680
<i>♪ War, my brother ♪</i>

59:44.581 --> 59:46.250
<i>♪ War, my brother ♪</i>
