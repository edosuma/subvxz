on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.069 --> 00:03.737
It's time, Becca,
time you stopped

00:03.771 --> 00:05.205
this funny business
and went back to school.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.740
No, I'm not doing that.

00:06.774 --> 00:07.874
There's a lot more,
little missy,

00:07.908 --> 00:09.242
to being an artist

00:09.276 --> 00:10.810
than just altering
your consciousness

00:10.845 --> 00:11.845
on a daily basis.

00:11.879 --> 00:12.979
Which is why I'm writing.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.147
How many pages you got?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.215
I'm closing in
on three hundy.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.483
I hate you.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.984
If I'm gonna do this thing,

00:18.019 --> 00:20.053
get me the guy
who wrote the fucking book.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.389
- Do what?
- <i>God hates us all.</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:24.090
I fucking loved it, man.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.059
They're turning it
into a Broadway musical.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.495
You write the script,
I write the music and lyrics.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.096
Let's make
a fucking masterpiece.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.297
Congratulations.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.934
You have made it
to the next round.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.303
I'll give you one of daddy's
long, slow tongue baths.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.340
Men are the enemy.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.909
I advocate the use
of a cock cage.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.111
Ophelia's gonna be
so pissed at me.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.747
We have sex
for the first time in years,

00:47.782 --> 00:50.016
and this is the first thing
to cross your mind?

00:50.051 --> 00:52.419
So how was
the fucking fun zone?

00:52.453 --> 00:53.720
There was this one mom--

00:53.754 --> 00:55.822
- Did you do something with her?
- No!

00:55.890 --> 00:58.358
I'd know that bent
fucking chode anywhere.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.695
- Is that what I think it is?
- Sure is.

01:02.831 --> 01:04.230
Would you mind
taking a look?

01:04.266 --> 01:06.700
Of course.
I'd be honored.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.959
What are you doing?
I'm studying your face.

01:32.027 --> 01:36.130
For the truth.

01:37.732 --> 01:38.899
You hate it.

01:38.934 --> 01:40.100
That's not true.

01:40.135 --> 01:41.335
Why would you say that?

01:41.369 --> 01:42.536
No.
No, no, no.

01:42.571 --> 01:44.238
I can see it
on your face.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.906
Have you met me, Becca?
I could be hating

01:45.941 --> 01:47.074
on a million other things
right now.

01:47.108 --> 01:50.377
Wow.
Thanks.

01:50.412 --> 01:51.745
Is it perfect?

01:51.780 --> 01:53.681
No, it's not,

01:53.715 --> 01:56.350
but first drafts
rarely are, sweetheart.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.752
Okay.
So what are your notes?

02:00.388 --> 02:02.056
Okay, this
is what I would do.

02:02.090 --> 02:04.058
I would take this draft,
and I would put it in a drawer--

02:04.092 --> 02:06.126
it doesn't have
to be a real drawer,

02:06.161 --> 02:07.895
it could be
a virtual drawer--

02:07.929 --> 02:10.396
and then go out tonight
and celebrate its birth.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.067
You know, hoist
an alcoholic beverage or two.

02:13.101 --> 02:14.268
I will join you.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.736
And then, in the morning,

02:15.770 --> 02:16.971
you shut that drawer
and forget about it.

02:17.005 --> 02:20.474
And then you start
on the next one.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.776
- The next one?
- Yeah.

02:22.811 --> 02:25.879
Well, what kind
of note is that?

02:27.249 --> 02:28.682
A big one?

02:30.819 --> 02:32.586
- So it's a disaster.
- No, I didn't--

02:32.621 --> 02:36.123
no, not at all.
Not at all.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.158
You don't even think
I'm a writer, do you?

02:38.193 --> 02:41.662
I think you're a writer
if you keep on writing, Becca.

02:41.696 --> 02:43.597
Am I a writer?

02:43.632 --> 02:46.233
Well, I know that, when I saw
you read your pages here

02:46.268 --> 02:49.103
in the coffeehouse, I was--
I was proud of you.

02:49.137 --> 02:50.304
You saw me?

02:50.338 --> 02:52.973
Yeah.
Yeah, I snuck in

02:53.008 --> 02:54.975
and then out again unseen.

02:55.010 --> 02:56.644
I asked you
not to come.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.312
I know,
but you didn't really mean it.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.247
Yes, I did.

03:00.282 --> 03:04.251
Well, aren't you secretly
touched that I cared enough

03:04.286 --> 03:08.622
to disobey
your wishes?

03:08.657 --> 03:11.258
Thanks for the destructive
criticism, Dad.

03:11.293 --> 03:13.427
To be continued,
sweetheart.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.830
One page at a time.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.336
I'm an asshole.

Ow.

04:18.374 --> 04:19.906
Hey.
Hi, Charlie.

04:20.295 --> 04:21.894
What's up?

04:21.930 --> 04:23.430
How come you haven't been
returning my calls,

04:23.465 --> 04:25.466
my texts?
Yeah, well, I think

04:25.500 --> 04:27.868
that I really took
a major step backward,

04:27.902 --> 04:29.837
and I disrespected
my sheness.

04:29.871 --> 04:31.171
Your wait.
Whoa, whoa, your what?

04:31.206 --> 04:33.907
I don't--
your--your "sheness"?

04:33.942 --> 04:36.577
I-I don't know
what the fuck that is.

04:36.611 --> 04:38.746
Is this--is this about
the Housewife Hannah thing?

04:38.780 --> 04:40.447
Because I'm sorry,

04:40.482 --> 04:43.350
but come on, you've been
to the fun zone, right?

04:43.385 --> 04:45.352
I mean, if somebody,
you know, offered you

04:45.387 --> 04:47.121
an ice cream cone in hell,
wouldn't you take it?

04:47.155 --> 04:49.390
You know you would.

04:49.424 --> 04:50.924
You know what I'm saying?

04:50.959 --> 04:53.460
Wow. His pictures
don't do him justice.

04:53.495 --> 04:56.463
- Oh, thank you.
- What a worm.

04:56.498 --> 04:58.031
I'm sorry?

04:58.066 --> 04:59.933
Yeah, you should be,
you fucking creep.

04:59.968 --> 05:02.202
Okay, who is she,

05:02.237 --> 05:04.138
and why is she being
so mean to me?

05:04.172 --> 05:06.140
Well, this
is Ophelia Robins.

05:06.174 --> 05:09.042
Oh, this is Ophelia,
the author.

05:09.077 --> 05:12.179
I'm--
hey, congratulations.

05:12.247 --> 05:15.215
'Cause you've really created
quite a cult for yourself

05:15.250 --> 05:16.683
with those books
out there, right?

05:16.718 --> 05:19.253
I'm Charlie Runkle,
formerly of UTK.

05:19.287 --> 05:20.988
Very nice to meet you.

05:21.022 --> 05:24.758
How dare you offer me
that diseased appendage?

05:24.793 --> 05:27.127
She's very hostile.

05:29.864 --> 05:33.267
Well, I just--I can't see you
anymore, Charlie.

05:33.301 --> 05:34.601
- Why?
- Why?

05:34.636 --> 05:36.837
You've disrespected
this woman

05:36.871 --> 05:38.439
time and time again.

05:38.473 --> 05:40.007
You've had your chance.
You blew it.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.009
Go away.
Okay, wait.

05:42.043 --> 05:43.343
I don't know who the fuck
you are, lady, okay,

05:43.378 --> 05:44.978
but you have no business

05:45.013 --> 05:46.513
telling me what to do--
how dare you raise

05:46.548 --> 05:48.115
your voice to me?
Uhoh.

05:48.149 --> 05:49.616
And I bet you're probably
one of those guys

05:49.651 --> 05:51.151
who likes to raise his hand
to women too.

05:51.186 --> 05:52.953
No!

05:52.987 --> 05:54.788
I mean,
unless she wants it.

05:54.823 --> 05:56.156
'Cause, you know,
there are some women

05:56.191 --> 05:57.658
who sometimes want to be,
you know,

05:57.692 --> 05:59.693
a little light slapping
now and again.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.829
Some even like to have
their breasts slapped

06:01.896 --> 06:03.664
a little bit--
ugh, God, he's even more

06:03.698 --> 06:05.199
of a monster
than I ever imagined, Marcy.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.767
Let's go.
Even you asked one time.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.001
- Don't!
- You asked me to!

06:08.036 --> 06:10.170
Marcy! Marcy!

06:10.205 --> 06:12.506
I'll call you.

06:14.142 --> 06:17.110
Je-sus.

06:17.145 --> 06:20.514
I have to schedule
the deprogramming.

06:23.251 --> 06:25.619
How's the next Broadway smash
coming, buddy?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.888
Is it whiskey, weed,
and Zevon time yet?

06:27.922 --> 06:30.524
Almost.
Just hold your bald horses.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.192
You're way past deadline,
you know?

06:32.227 --> 06:34.495
Stu and Atticus were expecting
a draft weeks ago.

06:34.529 --> 06:36.897
Yes, I'm well aware,
but I've been busy,

06:36.931 --> 06:38.031
you know,
putting 'em off.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.166
You're not helping.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.767
Sorry.

06:40.802 --> 06:43.237
Jeez.

06:46.941 --> 06:48.542
How do you feel about it?
Is it any good?

06:48.543 --> 06:50.143
How the fuck
should I know?

06:50.178 --> 06:51.845
I do like writing musicals,
though.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.146
You just write a few pages,
and then somebody

06:53.181 --> 06:54.581
suddenly breaks into song,

06:54.616 --> 06:56.383
and I don't have
to worry about that part.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.918
Winning!

06:57.952 --> 06:59.820
I love musicals.

06:59.854 --> 07:00.854
Really?

07:00.889 --> 07:02.422
Since when?

07:02.457 --> 07:04.358
High school production
of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

07:04.392 --> 07:06.693
The time of my young life.

07:08.129 --> 07:09.363
I fingered a girl
for the first time

07:09.397 --> 07:10.664
at the opening night party.
Ooh.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.833
She was incredibly dry,
Hank.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.435
I think
I was hurting her.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.837
She cried.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.739
Oh.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.942
Nothing like a sweet, little
Chuck Runkle coming-of-age story

07:21.976 --> 07:24.378
to make you want
to stab yourself in the dick.

07:24.412 --> 07:25.779
Done.
Hit it!

07:25.813 --> 07:29.116
Whoohoo-hoo!

07:30.585 --> 07:32.352
Where's my weed?

07:32.387 --> 07:34.021
- We're out.
- Well, you can't

07:34.055 --> 07:36.223
really have whiskey, weed,
and Warren Zevon

07:36.257 --> 07:38.325
without the weed.

07:38.393 --> 07:39.760
I know.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.395
I'll pick some up
on the way back.

07:41.429 --> 07:43.263
I'm making copies,
and I'm hand-delivering

07:43.298 --> 07:45.399
to Atticus and Stu.

07:45.433 --> 07:46.533
Yeah,
because that's just the kind

07:46.568 --> 07:48.835
of simple-minded lackey
you are.

07:48.870 --> 07:50.404
Oh, oh, Hank?

07:50.438 --> 07:52.806
Karen is here,
and she does not look happy.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.374
Mm, what else is new?

07:54.409 --> 07:56.643
Hey.

07:56.678 --> 07:58.545
Peace out, bitches.

07:58.580 --> 08:01.415
What did you say to her?

08:01.449 --> 08:02.916
What did she say I said?

08:02.951 --> 08:05.319
She said that you said
it was a piece of shit

08:05.353 --> 08:07.821
and that she should throw it out
and start again.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.089
That is not
what I said...

08:09.123 --> 08:10.490
Exactly.

08:10.525 --> 08:11.725
Why would you do that?

08:11.759 --> 08:13.493
Why would you be
so blunt?

08:13.528 --> 08:15.062
Why do you want
to hurt her feelings?

08:15.096 --> 08:16.563
I didn't want to.
I didn't mean to.

08:16.598 --> 08:17.898
She kind of ambushed me.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.132
And she does need
to throw that out

08:19.167 --> 08:20.801
and start again.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.669
It's a good lesson
for a young scribe.

08:22.704 --> 08:24.271
You know, get all the bad shit
out of your system.

08:24.305 --> 08:26.239
She's way ahead of where I was
at that age.

08:26.274 --> 08:28.475
Oh, okay, good.
So did you tell her that?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.943
No, I didn't get
a chance.

08:29.978 --> 08:31.845
She stormed off
into a silent treatment.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.047
Just like her mom.
She gets that from you.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.916
Very effective.
Works every time.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.484
She stormed off

08:37.518 --> 08:39.186
because you don't know
how to talk to her.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.988
I think I know how to talk
to my own daughter, Karen.

08:41.022 --> 08:42.688
I don't think you do,
because if you did,

08:42.724 --> 08:45.492
she wouldn't be
so depressed right now.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.861
She's talking
about going to law school.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.630
Really?
Awesome.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.698
- That's awesome?
- Yeah.

08:51.733 --> 08:53.800
Because if I can talk her
out of being a writer,

08:53.835 --> 08:55.202
then she shouldn't be
a writer.

08:55.236 --> 08:56.336
Oh, why?
Because there's only room

08:56.371 --> 08:57.971
for one writer
in this family?

08:58.006 --> 09:00.941
- Aww, you called us a family.
- Shut up.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.876
No, because people
who aren't writers

09:02.910 --> 09:04.544
should not be writers,
Karen.

09:04.579 --> 09:07.447
Does that make any sense?
I can understand that.

09:07.482 --> 09:10.017
What I don't understand
is how you can be so harsh

09:10.051 --> 09:11.818
and so mean
to someone you love.

09:11.886 --> 09:13.420
You could save that shit

09:13.488 --> 09:15.689
for when you have to go back
to teaching.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.991
Ooh, who's being mean
and harsh now?

09:18.026 --> 09:21.495
There it is!
Storm off into silent treatment!

Say, have you met
this Ophelia character?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.351
Oh, she is
a fucking fruitcake.

09:44.385 --> 09:46.186
I know.
She slapped me.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.487
Oh, you think
that's bad?

09:47.522 --> 09:49.356
She had me
in a fucking cock cage.

09:49.390 --> 09:51.425
What is a cock cage?

09:51.459 --> 09:53.994
It traps your penis
in its flaccid sta--

09:54.028 --> 09:55.929
Ladies, enough
of your jibber-jabber.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.397
You haven't said anything
about the script.

09:57.432 --> 10:00.367
Have you even read it?

10:00.401 --> 10:01.902
I have.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.670
Okay.
What'd you think?

10:03.705 --> 10:07.841
It...
was...

10:07.875 --> 10:09.443
very you.

10:09.477 --> 10:11.611
What the fuck
does that mean?

10:11.646 --> 10:13.346
It's a little dark,
Hank.

10:13.381 --> 10:15.415
Dark is what I do.
That's what you hired me for.

10:15.450 --> 10:17.217
It's a Broadway musical,
Hank.

10:17.251 --> 10:19.252
It's a rock opera,
and it's true to the book,

10:19.287 --> 10:22.055
which is
what Atticus wanted.

10:24.492 --> 10:25.892
Thank you for coming,
everybody.

10:25.927 --> 10:27.027
Unfortunately, I have
to go in a moment.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.595
I'm flying to London

10:28.629 --> 10:32.065
to sit down with Eddie Nero
and sir Bob Geldoff.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.302
We're talking about doing this
global relief concert thing.

10:35.336 --> 10:36.636
It's, you know--

10:36.671 --> 10:38.138
speaking of relief,

10:38.172 --> 10:41.041
this is
a fucking disaster.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.710
- What?
- It's shit, Hank.

10:43.745 --> 10:45.579
It's a fucking shambles.

10:45.613 --> 10:47.581
It's--

10:47.615 --> 10:48.915
it's bollocks.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.450
Um, I agree.

10:50.485 --> 10:53.787
Hank, I'm sorry.
It needs work.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.756
Yeah,
we're really gonna have

10:55.790 --> 10:57.290
to roll up our sleeves
on this one.

10:57.325 --> 10:58.892
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.894
It's a rock opera
with the tone of my book.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.462
That's what you wanted.

11:02.497 --> 11:04.131
I don't even like
the fucking book.

11:04.165 --> 11:06.566
You said
you loved it.

11:06.601 --> 11:09.302
Remember?
On your flying whorehouse?

11:09.337 --> 11:10.904
Yeah, I remember,
but when I said that,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.973
I hadn't read it.
So you lied?

11:13.007 --> 11:14.474
I wouldn't look at it
like that.

11:14.509 --> 11:15.609
I liked the title.

11:15.643 --> 11:16.643
It was quite striking.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.278
Titles mean a lot to me,

11:18.312 --> 11:20.080
but when I got around
to reading the fucking book,

11:20.114 --> 11:22.249
oh, my God,
it's so depressing.

11:22.283 --> 11:25.919
It's like it's Dickensian
but not in a good way.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.921
The working classes
want to leave

11:27.955 --> 11:31.191

11:31.225 --> 11:32.626
when they leave
one of my concerts.

11:32.660 --> 11:34.995
- With tinnitus?
- Happy, uplifted, inspired,

11:35.029 --> 11:36.496
preferably
a little bit horny.

11:36.531 --> 11:38.165
Yeah, well,
that's very funny

11:38.232 --> 11:39.952
'cause I'm not feeling
very horny right now.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.868
Just homicidal maybe.

11:41.903 --> 11:44.371
Hank, we're gonna need you
to burn this draft,

11:44.405 --> 11:46.606
just forget
all about it.

11:46.641 --> 11:50.644
Chalk it up
to a creative miscarriage.

11:50.678 --> 11:53.513
But when you
get up tomorrow,

11:53.548 --> 11:55.215
you take a fresh page,

11:55.249 --> 11:57.217
you put it
in your typer,

11:57.251 --> 11:59.352
and you start
a new one,

11:59.387 --> 12:04.391
one that hues closer
to the tone of the movie.

12:04.425 --> 12:07.994
Can you do that?

12:08.029 --> 12:10.597
Otherwise, Aaron Sorkin
has expressed interest

12:10.665 --> 12:12.299
in working with Atticus.

in the business.

12:15.303 --> 12:17.070
Just ask him.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.905
And he is a big admirer
of your work.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.540
As I am of his.

12:20.575 --> 12:22.509
This is bullshit.

12:22.543 --> 12:24.077
You know why, Hank?

12:24.111 --> 12:27.347
No, why?

12:27.381 --> 12:30.317
Because you can't handle

Sure, sure.

Look, it's just--
it's his process, Stu, okay?

12:56.711 --> 12:58.211
He brings in
something underwhelming,

Well, I don't know
what you're going to do,

What?

13:46.227 --> 13:48.328
I will not lend you
a fucking dime,

not to pursue Marcy any longer.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.766
So how much you want?

13:52.800 --> 13:55.568
Give me a number.

I don't want your--

13:58.839 --> 14:00.173
how much are you
willing to pay?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.809
I would sign over
my entire fortune

to cock-block us

14:25.967 --> 14:27.467
at every turn.

14:27.501 --> 14:31.004
- We could have her killed.
- You think?

Well, it's just
a matter of money.

Solid plan,

You're right,
Runkle.

pint-sized stoner chick,

in New York,

I like it.
Others, not so much.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.158

15:25.192 --> 15:27.394
well, they're calling it
a creative miscarriage.

- Oh, God, no.
- Yeah.

That is no way to talk
about our love baby.

Of course I do that.

the truth.

that phrase.

Yes, but we have
a child together.

True, but I am far more
capable of taking care of you,

17:25.045 --> 17:28.281
both financially
and sexually,

17:28.315 --> 17:30.717

Jodie Foster in <i>The Accused."</i>

- I'm going.
- Wait!

17:55.376 --> 17:57.143
- Stay, Marcy!
- One drink, one drink.

17:57.178 --> 17:59.479
One drink.
One drink, one drink.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.014

a couple brothers out.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.016
Some appletini
to start?

You hate it, you hate it.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.564
I can tell you hate it.
That's all right.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.499
- I don't hate it.
- And that totally bums me out,

18:19.533 --> 18:21.034
but then you could--
I don't hate it.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.548
You could have pool sex
with me again,

18:22.570 --> 18:25.271
and I'll maybe feel
a little better.

18:25.306 --> 18:27.774
What do you think?

18:27.808 --> 18:30.510
What do I think?
Um...

18:30.544 --> 18:33.246
It's very dark.
Uhhuh.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.847
Dark. Funny.

18:34.882 --> 18:36.549
Funny-dark.
Mm.

18:36.584 --> 18:38.885

what you're trying to do

18:38.919 --> 18:40.920
as far as...

18:40.955 --> 18:42.555
You're doing something
really different with it.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.157
I get that.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.191
But...

18:45.226 --> 18:48.595
But...

18:48.629 --> 18:50.029
It doesn't have any heart.

18:50.064 --> 18:52.398
And if there
is one thing

18:52.433 --> 18:54.400
that I know about you,
Hank Moody,

18:54.435 --> 18:58.871
it's that
you have a huge...

18:58.906 --> 19:00.540
heart.

19:02.676 --> 19:07.113
I think that maybe
you were posturing a little bit.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.681
- Eww.
- You know, you were trying

19:08.716 --> 19:10.550
to show the world
that you are not gonna write

19:10.584 --> 19:13.186
some fluffy
Broadway musical.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.089
And I think, in the process
of doing that,

19:16.123 --> 19:19.659
maybe you forgot
that it's still a story

19:19.693 --> 19:21.661
of boy meets girl.

19:21.695 --> 19:25.131
You know?
It's simple.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.334
I think I get that.
I do, I get it.

19:28.369 --> 19:32.805
Anyone can be cynical,
Hank.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.307
Dare to be an optimist.

19:38.479 --> 19:41.814
You know it's all just a big can
of karmic whoop-ass anyway,

19:41.849 --> 19:43.416
you know?
Mmhmm.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.018
'Cause my daughter,

19:45.052 --> 19:46.986
she just wrote
her first novel,

19:47.021 --> 19:49.555
and I was really
fucking hard on her.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.624
Oh, you have
to be really gentle

19:51.659 --> 19:53.926
with those little girls,
Hank.

19:53.961 --> 19:57.130
God, my parents,

19:57.164 --> 19:59.299
they hit me pretty hard
once upon a time.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.433
I'm still smarting.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.735
About what?
What happened?

20:02.770 --> 20:04.704
Do you know
<i>Big Yellow Taxi?</i>

20:04.738 --> 20:06.472
- No.
- By Joni Mitchell?

20:06.507 --> 20:08.474
No, I don't know
any Joni Mitchell songs.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.809
No? None?

20:09.843 --> 20:12.478

20:41.842 --> 20:43.176
Mm.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.311
I was obsessed
with Joni Mitchell

20:45.379 --> 20:47.013
when I was a teenager.

20:47.047 --> 20:49.047
I wanted to be a lady
of the Canyon when I grew up.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.183
Me too.

20:50.217 --> 20:51.918
We have so much
in common.

20:51.952 --> 20:56.389
And so I got together
with this cute boy

20:56.423 --> 20:57.857
who played the guitar,

20:57.891 --> 21:02.362
and we practiced
every day after school.

21:02.396 --> 21:06.699
And finally,
the big day came,

21:06.734 --> 21:10.436
and we played
our little hearts out,

21:10.471 --> 21:15.274
and, you know,
he forgot a few chords,

21:15.309 --> 21:17.577
and I forgot
a few words,

21:17.611 --> 21:21.080
and my voice cracked and--
mmhmm.

21:21.115 --> 21:23.383
But people clapped.

21:23.417 --> 21:26.686
And I was so thrilled. Ah!
Ah!

21:26.720 --> 21:28.855
They kind of loved us.
Yeah.

21:28.889 --> 21:32.058
And I went looking
for my parents,

21:32.092 --> 21:33.860
and of course,
all my mom had to say

21:33.894 --> 21:35.762
was that I looked
like a slut up there.

21:35.796 --> 21:39.098
And my father said,

21:39.133 --> 21:41.868
"Don't quit your day job,
kid."

21:41.902 --> 21:46.038
- Mm.
- Nice, huh?

21:48.776 --> 21:51.778
The whole thing
was not a bust, however.

21:51.812 --> 21:55.915
I lost my virginity
to that cute guitarist.

21:55.949 --> 21:59.986
- Oh.
- Yeah.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.588
I think it's becoming
a pattern.

22:02.623 --> 22:05.992
- Mm-hmm.

22:35.122 --> 22:36.389
Oh, my.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.257
I'm so disappointed
in you.

22:38.292 --> 22:40.326
I mean,
I'm not surprised.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.795
The road to sheness
is long,

22:42.830 --> 22:44.330
and it's paved
with potholes.

22:44.364 --> 22:48.601
Okay, that just makes
no sense at all.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.303
You don't pave
with potholes.

22:50.337 --> 22:51.604
You pave over potholes.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.473
It absolutely
makes sense.

22:53.507 --> 22:57.109
It's in my third book,
<i>Menis to Society.</i>

22:57.144 --> 23:01.047
M-e-n-i-s.

23:01.081 --> 23:03.182
Oh, catchy title.
And subtle.

23:03.217 --> 23:05.618
And what have you written
that's changed lives,

23:05.652 --> 23:07.053
you pathetic,
little simian?

23:07.087 --> 23:10.690
Marcy, let's go.
I'll drive you home.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.458
Wait one second,
Ophelia.

23:12.493 --> 23:15.261
How did you even know
where I was just now?

23:15.329 --> 23:16.896
Oh, I tracked
your iPhone.

23:16.930 --> 23:19.499
Oh.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.334
Okay, that's just--
what?

23:21.368 --> 23:23.536
That's so fucking weird.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.210
It's not that weird.
I mean, I've seen you

23:25.239 --> 23:26.873
check your email,
like, several times,

23:26.940 --> 23:28.875
and I happen to be very good
at recognizing keystrokes.

23:28.942 --> 23:31.811
And your password
is distinctive

23:31.845 --> 23:33.813
and disgusting,
and, you know,

23:33.847 --> 23:35.748
that's when I really realized
that we had a problem

23:35.782 --> 23:38.551
that was just much bigger
than I ever imagined.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.721
Oh, y-you're kidding.
It's not still...

23:41.755 --> 23:45.758
Oh, "I love my hubby's
big, fat cock," all one word.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.494
Yes, it is.
You must be so proud.

23:48.529 --> 23:51.764
Oh, I am,
and you still care.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.367
Oh, I was too lazy
to change it!

23:54.401 --> 23:55.801
Yeah, well,
either way,

23:55.836 --> 23:57.537
I am thrilled.
And I'm nauseous.

23:57.571 --> 23:59.772
Marcy, are you ready
to come home?

23:59.806 --> 24:02.241
You can spend the night
at my house.

24:02.276 --> 24:03.442
Okay, you know what?

24:03.477 --> 24:05.545
I think that you
should let Marcy

24:05.579 --> 24:08.648
embrace her sheness
and make up her own mind

24:08.682 --> 24:10.850
where she wants
to spend the night.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.718
You know,
I heartily concur.

24:12.753 --> 24:14.787
Need I remind you,
Stu,

24:14.821 --> 24:17.456
that I hold the key
to your cock cage.

24:17.491 --> 24:19.058
Do you have it
on your person?

24:19.092 --> 24:20.760
I'll write you a check
right this very instant.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.261
This is
just ridiculous.

24:22.296 --> 24:24.363
Look, Marcy, you know what?
Don't worry.

24:24.398 --> 24:25.898
We will make sure
you get home.

24:25.933 --> 24:27.533
Oh, are you gonna lay
your hands on her now?

24:27.568 --> 24:29.268
You want worse
than you got yesterday,

24:29.303 --> 24:30.736
you slimy,
little sea otter?

24:30.771 --> 24:31.971
What are you gonna do?

24:32.005 --> 24:33.205
You gonna slap me again,
is that it,

24:33.240 --> 24:34.507
in front
of all these people?

24:35.943 --> 24:38.044
Oh!

24:38.078 --> 24:40.546
Woman, you are
a fucking fruitcake!

24:41.748 --> 24:43.482
Oh, my God!
Ophelia!

24:43.517 --> 24:45.384
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

24:45.419 --> 24:47.420
What? It's fine.
I stunned them, you know?

24:47.454 --> 24:49.755
Marcy, every woman should have
one of these puppies.

24:49.790 --> 24:52.558
It just totally neutralizes
the height-weight advantage.

24:52.626 --> 24:53.826
I'll get you one.
Let's go.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.394
No, man.

24:55.429 --> 24:57.430
This is too fucking weird.
You just go.

24:57.464 --> 24:59.699
You get out of here.
Go.

24:59.733 --> 25:02.168
Marcy.

25:02.202 --> 25:04.837
You're gonna regret this.

25:11.144 --> 25:13.112
Jesus.
Are you okay?

25:13.146 --> 25:14.480
What did that feel like?

25:14.514 --> 25:16.749
This table is all wet.

25:16.783 --> 25:20.419
Oh, gross.
You pissed your pants, Charlie.

25:20.454 --> 25:22.521

No!

Apparently,
it's not very good.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.301
Like getting shanked
in prison.

26:09.336 --> 26:12.371

26:12.406 --> 26:15.341
You know, maybe you
could read it for me

26:15.375 --> 26:17.476
and give me

26:17.511 --> 26:18.711
Why would you want

26:18.745 --> 26:20.146
I'm not a writer.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.084

26:33.560 --> 26:35.928
Thank you.

26:35.962 --> 26:40.099
And I'm sorry
that you stormed off

26:40.133 --> 26:43.269
before I could give you
my notes, you know?

26:43.303 --> 26:45.337
You know what I really dug
about your work

26:45.372 --> 26:49.208
was the relationship
between the daughter

26:49.242 --> 26:50.943
and the asshole father.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.680
I mean, obviously you took
a lot of creative license there,

26:54.715 --> 26:56.415
but it felt authentic
to me.

26:56.450 --> 26:58.851
And I think,
if you flesh it out,

26:58.885 --> 27:01.554
you could maybe turn it
into a novella.

27:01.588 --> 27:04.156
- You think so?
- I do.

27:04.191 --> 27:07.093
And I'm sorry
that you walked away from me,

27:07.127 --> 27:08.928
thinking that I didn't think
you were special,

27:08.962 --> 27:09.962
Becca, 'cause I do.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.865
I think you're so special.

the world needs another lawyer.

27:20.140 --> 27:23.209
I'm not sure it needs
another writer either.

27:23.243 --> 27:25.644
Yeah, maybe not,
but if you're doing

27:25.679 --> 27:29.582
what you were born to do,
then that's a good thing.

27:29.616 --> 27:31.884

27:46.733 --> 27:48.801
Okay.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.670

about my next move.
