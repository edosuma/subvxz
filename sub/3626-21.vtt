00:05.135 --> 00:06.223
- No.
- Quiet.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.964
- Stop.
- Hey! Jenny!

00:08.051 --> 00:09.139
Sarah Lawrence cannot accept

00:09.226 --> 00:11.228
someone who has hazed a teacher.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.796
Colleges stopped accepting
applications months ago.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.406
I don't have
any other options.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.843
What happened?
Yale has great financial aid.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.671
Well, as of now,
we're a low priority.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.586
- It's all determined by need.
- We're not needy enough?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.240
It sounds to me
like you need to get away.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.807
Yes! Road trip.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.157
I was thinking more like
a private jet to Spain.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.898
- When do we leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.682
- ToEspana!
- ToEspana!

00:30.769 --> 00:33.207
I met you last year. You were
calling yourself Savannah.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.556
- It's Serena.
- It's nice to meet you again.

00:34.643 --> 00:35.818
I'm Gabriel.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.124
All I want to tell
you is that

00:37.211 --> 00:38.690
I do want to be with you.

Where has she been..

00:43.956 --> 00:45.697
And who am I?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.525
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.615
You know you love me.

this miserable creature in?

money so I can go to Yale.'

It's my dream, it is.
Always has been.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.129
Yale? You foolish
little girl.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.784
That dream is over.
Time to wake up.

No. No.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.138
'No! No!'

This is my dream. No!

01:38.272 --> 01:39.882

01:39.969 --> 01:41.927
When you lose hope in a dream

01:42.014 --> 01:45.453
sometimes all you're left with
are sleepless nights.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.804
While some call the doctor
for a refill

01:48.891 --> 01:50.458
I find the best solution

01:50.545 --> 01:53.330
is a full social calendar.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.854
And here Nate and I are
at the Young Fellows Ball.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.247
And here we are with
his grandfather

01:57.334 --> 01:58.901
William Van Der Bilt.

01:58.988 --> 02:02.078
Cyrus, focus. You missed a lot
while you were gone.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.254
I'm sorry, but I have
an enormous amount to do

02:04.341 --> 02:06.996
before the Passover supper
tonight. The Seder.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.650
Oh, it smells delicious

02:08.737 --> 02:11.435
Oh, I am making
a brisket that is gonna

02:11.522 --> 02:13.437
blow your socks off.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.091
Be sure to save me some.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.572
For the last time
this dinner is very important

02:17.659 --> 02:19.182
to your stepfather and me.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.402
And if only I could be
two people, but you know

02:23.099 --> 02:24.579
'is getting married tomorrow.'

02:24.666 --> 02:26.537
The dinner's tonight,
and I'm late for the rehearsal.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.583
Rehearsal? You're not even
in the wedding.

02:28.670 --> 02:32.413
No, but Nate texted me,
and he said he had a surprise.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.805
'I'm betting it's about
the junior committee'

02:33.892 --> 02:35.198

promised to get me on.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.766
Okay, just wait a minute.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.420
Young lady, you are gonna
have to get serious

02:39.507 --> 02:40.464
about your future.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.031

02:42.118 --> 02:44.164
of four charities
and two museums

02:44.251 --> 02:46.731
and needs a personal assistant
to keep track of her schedule.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.604
Not to mention being a socialite
was good enough for Jackie O.

02:49.691 --> 02:54.565
You know, my old friend, JR,
is a big mugwump at NYU

02:54.652 --> 02:56.654
and he happens
to owe me a favor.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.091
Cyrus saved JR's life in 'Nam.

Oh. Well, I'm sorry,
but just because I lost Yale

03:03.095 --> 03:05.402
does not mean I'm wasting
my time at a non-Ivy

03:06.882 --> 03:09.406

are not socialites.

Uh, I just read and ate
and, you know, swam.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.529
So there was
nude sunbathing.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.358
Hey, uh, is my mom around?

03:48.445 --> 03:51.579
I haven't seen her,
but I have been occupied.

She's a synchronized swimmer

03:55.409 --> 03:56.932

for five minutes.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.978
So y-you, you found a way
to get over Blair then.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.851
Well, there was a detour
with a Boho and Barista.

04:02.938 --> 04:06.246
And then I realized
I'm a 17-year-old billionaire

04:06.333 --> 04:08.335
with tremendous stamina.

04:08.422 --> 04:11.599

the Bolshoi's lead ballerina.

I saw Poppy Lifton

04:17.387 --> 04:19.737

how she can be there

yet still be in Spain
with you.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.372
And can you please remind
the attendants

04:45.459 --> 04:47.374
not to seat me
behind Caroline Kennedy?

04:47.461 --> 04:50.202
She may be American royalty,
but that woman is a giraffe.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.423
Sure.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.730
Oh, hey. Tripp asked me
to go to lunch with him.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.559
He said it was important,
but I think he's just scared

04:58.646 --> 05:00.474
I'm gonna talk about his
ex-girlfriends during my toast.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.563
Fine. I'll come by
before dinner.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.435
- Hope that's not your surprise.
- Oh, yeah.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.089
I'll have to think
of a way to thank Maureen

05:07.176 --> 05:08.177
with the Whitney Committee.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.179
I got into Columbia.

That's amazing. I didn't
even know you applied.

Well, I just, I wanted
to see if I could get in

05:20.276 --> 05:21.930
without any family help,
you know.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.671
I mean, all my grandfather
had to do to get me into Yale

05:23.758 --> 05:25.455
was just make
a phone call and..

05:28.240 --> 05:29.764
I'm sorry.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.113
It's fine.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.595
I'm so happy for you.

05:34.682 --> 05:35.683
So that means no Yale?

No, honestly,
I'm-I'm torn.

of you to come.

Yes, it-it's going to be
so beautiful.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.304

some disappointing news.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.697
The Whitney Junior Committee

05:49.784 --> 05:52.917
felt you were too new
on the scene.

05:53.004 --> 05:56.312
They chose Elizabeth instead.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.358
- Your bridesmaid?
- Give it time.

When it comes to these things

feel any better

by my grandfather.

Yep. We're tracking air quality
on plant growth.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.865
One of these was grown
in our apartment

06:27.952 --> 06:31.129
and the other was grown
in Wes' country house.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.653
Apparently a tree
does not grow in Brooklyn.

- Yeah.
- Good.

of science that

strictly professional.

if you change your mind.

Look, I'm the one with
the expensive Yale tuition.

Please let me help. There's
gotta be a job on Craigslist

dealing or nudity.

- Bye.
- Good luck.

so stubborn about this.

a catering company.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.568
Catering? That definitely was
not on the top of my list

if you don't mind asking her.

I can ask him to come to dinner

accepted to Columbia.

of his intentions?

Not in so many words.

of having gotten in on his own.

your opinion.

Perhaps you could show him that
Yale is the appropriate choice.

I'm sorry.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.536
I, um, I've just,
I've been feeling really lost.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.148
Oh, spare me, Serena.
The only thing that is lost

10:27.235 --> 10:30.151
is your sense of responsibility
and consideration.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.022
'It seems to me
that the old Serena is back'

10:32.109 --> 10:35.199
and I'm not very happy
to see her.

10:35.286 --> 10:38.028
So you might want
to take your coat off

10:38.115 --> 10:39.464
because you're grounded.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.433
S! You're back from Spain!

10:51.520 --> 10:53.261
'Yeah. I just landed.'

10:53.348 --> 10:56.830
- 'Hey, uh, are you home?'
- No. More like avoiding it.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.136

are hosting Passover.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.617

were supposed to be spared.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.488

at the apartment all day?

fitted at Reem Acra'

his cousin's rehearsal dinner.

the Bass-ian desert'

the Van Der Bilt promised land.'

11:16.327 --> 11:19.548
That's great. Um, listen,
I have to run some errands

11:19.635 --> 11:21.550
but let's talk later, okay?

11:23.595 --> 11:26.990
I thought Maureen was
only having five bridesmaids.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.688
Oh, it was kind of last minute.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.125
And I think a little higher
on the hem.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.129
So, I'm gonna need
a couple minutes

11:35.216 --> 11:36.173

my tray balancing.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.958
I've never done this before.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.743

be a tray-balancing wunderkind.

talking thing all night?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.834
It's cool.
I just need to know.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.358
No, I'm sorry. I-I didn't tell
my dad I took this job

11:47.445 --> 11:49.404
and I-I feel so bad
keeping it from him

11:49.491 --> 11:50.405
but, you know,
he gets so defensive.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.015
I'll take that as a yes.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.323
Oh.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.151
- Oh, no, no, no.

to buy some candles.

just can't light some votives.

send over a replacement.

absolutely overextended.

and she hates me.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.134
I have never thrown
a Seder before.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.528

half the words

for Lieberman's wife.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.793
She, uh, she's Hadassah.

is called Haggadah.

I-I don't

12:35.842 --> 12:37.147

12:37.234 --> 12:38.758
But Blair won't be here.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.151

at the Whitney?

this whole college thing.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.893

13:28.155 --> 13:29.721
Okay.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.549

my old prejudice speaking

13:31.636 --> 13:33.508

13:33.595 --> 13:36.206

because of my grandfather

13:36.293 --> 13:38.339

or my family anything.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.388
After tonight,
we're done with them.

the legalities of it

tell your mother.

go up to her and say

got married in Spain.

in this huge fight

14:36.788 --> 14:38.834
and then she just leaves,
abandoning me and Gabriel.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.358
And so I-I stayed around
to keep him company.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.360
- Well, you did a bang-up job.
- Dan, please.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.971
Gabriel and Poppy were over.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.668

of us planned this.

between us just happened

14:48.365 --> 14:49.323

if I am married.

is trying to figure out.

How does one not know
if one is married?

15:00.029 --> 15:02.249
Well, there was a dinner.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.468
And then we had a lot of Rioja

15:04.555 --> 15:07.558

and then more Rioja

and went swimming in the ocean.

Watch out, B.

It seems like
just when you got it right

29:09.356 --> 29:12.751
William Van Der Bilt
is going to do you wrong.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.190
That was the washing

29:17.277 --> 29:19.583
of the hands.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.369
Also called the title 88

29:26.373 --> 29:29.071
Next we have the dipping
of the vegetable.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.769
You mean we're finally going
to get to eat something?

29:30.856 --> 29:33.075
Oh, yes, Parsley.

So are you two
really together again?

'So if, uh, Corrine
would get everyone'

29:38.559 --> 29:40.300

29:40.387 --> 29:41.997
Wait, I'm sorry, why doesn't
everybody seem to know the two

29:42.084 --> 29:43.346
of you are back together?

29:43.433 --> 29:44.521
And what kind of daughter
doesn't--

29:44.608 --> 29:47.568
Shh. There's praying
about to happen.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.570

When did..

29:49.657 --> 29:50.832
That's fine.

When did this happen?

29:52.225 --> 29:53.879
'You just broke up
two months ago.'

29:53.966 --> 29:55.489
I thought you said you broke up
right before Spain.

29:55.576 --> 29:56.925
Mm. It's complicated.

during the Seder.

Thank you.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.544
I'm sorry. I-I just don't
believe he's your boyfriend.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.155
First of all,
he's dressed like a waiter.

30:09.242 --> 30:11.070
I think it's kind
of a classic look.

'Well, he is my boyfriend'

- What is going on?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.133
I-I'm a cater waiter.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.137
And not a very good one.

to help with college?

I know
you didn't want me to, dad

I'm proud of what
you did back there.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.888
I thought you were, too.

31:31.019 --> 31:33.239
Did you tell my grandfather

31:34.501 --> 31:35.981
you would convince
me to go to Yale

31:36.068 --> 31:37.460
in exchange for him
making you a bridesmaid?

31:39.854 --> 31:41.029
I can explain.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.207
That's great, you know?

31:45.294 --> 31:47.383
First my grandfather
sells my father out

31:47.470 --> 31:49.908
and then you sell meout

31:49.995 --> 31:51.083
for a picture
in the style section.

31:51.170 --> 31:53.607
No. But I didn't!

31:53.694 --> 31:56.349
I mean, God, I did

31:56.436 --> 31:57.785
but then I realized
when he asked me again--

31:57.872 --> 31:59.221
You know what?

31:59.308 --> 32:02.616
I actually thought this time
would be different.

the same girl you always were.

about next year and us.

me another chance.

- It wasn't a scene.

Right out of the old

to that, but it wasn't all bad.

I miss the good parts.
I miss feeling free

33:00.108 --> 33:02.763
feeling like I can do something
just because I want to

33:02.850 --> 33:04.199
and there has
to be a balance.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.635
Well, of course there does.

But if every time
I make a mistake

33:07.333 --> 33:08.725
you look at me
like I'm a bad person

33:08.812 --> 33:10.597

to find that?

think of you as a bad person.
