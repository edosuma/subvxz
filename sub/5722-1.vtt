Ping him.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.550
No way.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.716
Ask him who he is.

05:18.717 --> 05:20.453
We do that and
we lose our cover.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.654
Dude.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.188
They are poking
around like we are.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.691
They're not supposed

He's pinging us.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.267
Wait, no.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.204
Let me see who it is first.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.740
The IP address...

05:41.741 --> 05:43.309
is non-attributable.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.077
So?

05:45.078 --> 05:48.214
So it's probably
government.

We don't want to be
showing them anything.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.317
What's he doing?

05:51.318 --> 05:52.585
Nothing.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.152

05:54.153 --> 05:55.622

Can you tell who he is?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.022
TECH:
No.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.223
Can you tell where he is?

05:58.224 --> 06:00.227
That's the point of the proxies.

06:00.228 --> 06:02.394
He doesn't want us to know.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.695
But if you care
about that Web site,

06:03.696 --> 06:04.764
you're probably here in Germany.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.632
(computer beeping)

06:06.633 --> 06:09.969
Hold on a second.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.338
He's trying to get in.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.609
There's a zero day
defect on this firewall.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.745
We can get through brute force,

06:19.746 --> 06:21.248

No, you can't.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.525
Hey, I said no, man!

06:38.231 --> 06:39.999
What? What is it?

06:40.000 --> 06:40.967

06:40.968 --> 06:42.735
Who is?
Douche Bag?

What the fuck?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.236

06:45.237 --> 06:46.640

Shut it down, shut it down!

06:46.641 --> 06:48.240
Shutting down.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.709

down right now...

06:57.183 --> 06:58.551

07:00.553 --> 07:01.621

07:34.454 --> 07:37.089

07:37.090 --> 07:39.324
You ready for school?
Look, look,

07:39.325 --> 07:40.593
all your friends
are here.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.194
See? Ilsa

07:42.195 --> 07:44.463
and JJ
and Fraulein Schnee.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.133
And they're gonna be
so excited to see you.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.569
'Cause it's
your birthday!

07:49.570 --> 07:51.337
(giggling)

07:51.338 --> 07:53.038
What do we say?
We say,

07:53.039 --> 07:55.039
<i>"Auf Wiedersehen,"</i>
which means

07:55.040 --> 07:56.676
"Till we see each other again."

07:56.677 --> 07:58.477
Which will be really soon.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.080
- I love you.
- At your party.

08:00.081 --> 08:02.182
Mwah.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.719
CARRIE:
Who's that?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.220
What is that?

08:08.221 --> 08:09.656
(laughing)

08:25.538 --> 08:28.307
(telephone ringing)

08:28.308 --> 08:31.277
- Morning, Irma.
- He's with the Lebanese ambassador.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.212
WOMAN:
Oh. Thank you.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.179
Oh, here she is, Ambassador.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.217
I'd like you to meet my head
of security, Carrie Mathison.

08:38.219 --> 08:40.284
Carrie,
Ambassador Jamil.

08:40.285 --> 08:41.553
Hello, sir.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.221
We weren't expecting
you until next week.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.291
There's been
a change of plans.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.226
I'll tell you
all about it.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.495
JAMIL:
Otto, keep in touch.

08:48.496 --> 08:50.230
I will.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.099
Jonas.
I wish you were my lawyer.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.134
Can't have him.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.636
Thank you both.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.012
We are going to Lebanon.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.014
Okay.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.283
I told the ambassador

09:10.284 --> 09:12.452
we could leave in three days.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.987
You want to tell me
what I just missed, here?

09:15.988 --> 09:17.488
ISIS is regrouping in Raqqa

09:17.489 --> 09:19.457
for a new offensive
against the Syrian regime.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.225
I know.
We talked about it.

09:21.226 --> 09:22.660
But it's not playing out
the way anyone thought.

09:22.661 --> 09:24.495
There's a mass exodus
of civilians underway.

09:24.496 --> 09:27.367
A refugee crisis
is developing at the border.

09:27.368 --> 09:29.601
I want us to visit a camp there.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.636
In Lebanon.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.371
Us.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.473
Yeah.
You, me,

09:34.474 --> 09:36.076
some additional security.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.177
"Additional security"

09:38.178 --> 09:39.712
is what we take
to conferences in Geneva.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.381
This is a war zone.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.017
We're really
not equipped.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.484
Well,

09:45.485 --> 09:47.487
we have three days.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.209
You're on.

10:11.159 --> 10:14.176
_

10:14.614 --> 10:16.815
There.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.784
This is Peter Quinn.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.920
He's been on the ground in Syria

10:20.921 --> 10:23.656
for the past two years.

10:26.859 --> 10:30.530
We're all eager to hear
about your experience there.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.271
I just got back from
the Al-Raqqah province

10:39.272 --> 10:41.440
in the oil-producing regions...

10:41.441 --> 10:43.375
Could you speak up?

10:43.376 --> 10:44.443
Please?

10:44.444 --> 10:45.945
It's a big table.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.885
(louder):
Al-Raqqah.

10:53.886 --> 10:57.889
It's where I've been
for the past few months.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.059
Our approach has
remained constant.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.696
US air strikes prepare targets
for surgical intervention

11:03.697 --> 11:05.597
by special forces,

11:05.598 --> 11:08.934
initially against Assad,
then al-Nusra,

11:08.935 --> 11:11.771
and most recently against
the Islamic State.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.573
I've been heading up

11:14.574 --> 11:16.942
a team of special ops

11:16.943 --> 11:20.645
more or less continuously
for the past 28 months.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.882
We've been busy.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.385
CROCKER:
Doing what?

11:27.954 --> 11:30.821
What the hell is actually
going on over there?

11:30.822 --> 11:32.925
Well, if you've read
the after action reports...

11:32.926 --> 11:33.925
I have.

11:33.926 --> 11:34.925
Every one of them.

11:34.926 --> 11:36.629
A handful of enemy dead here.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.730
Another handful there.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.000
I honestly have no idea
what it all adds up to.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.007
The program
has been effective, sir.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.276
I believe
it should be continued.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.678
You do?

11:53.913 --> 11:55.914
Assad is still in power.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.816
ISIL is still growing.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.386
Are we really getting
anywhere in Syria?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.354
I just said yes.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.822
You said a program
should be renewed.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.826
I'm asking,
is our strategy working?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.828
What strategy?

12:10.997 --> 12:12.663
Tell me what the strategy is.

12:12.664 --> 12:14.300
I'll tell you if it's working.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.610
See, that right there
is the problem.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.780
Because they,
they have a strategy.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.683
They're gathering
right now in Raqqa

12:30.684 --> 12:33.585
by the tens of thousands.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.987
Hidden in
the civilian population.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.722
Cleaning their weapons.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.325
And they know exactly
why they're there.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.358
Why is that?

12:40.359 --> 12:41.859
They call it the end times.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.628
What do you think
the beheadings are about?

12:44.629 --> 12:46.397
The crucifixions in Deir Hafer?

12:46.398 --> 12:47.731
The revival of slavery?

12:47.732 --> 12:49.569
You think they make
this shit up?

12:49.570 --> 12:51.736
It's all in the book.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.271
Their fucking book.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.705
The only book they ever read.

12:54.706 --> 12:55.575
They read it all the time.

12:55.576 --> 12:56.875
They never stop.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.477
They're there
for one reason

12:59.478 --> 13:00.713
and one reason only.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.681
To die for the caliphate

13:02.682 --> 13:05.051
and usher in a world
without infidels.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.853
That's <i>their</i> strategy.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.488
And it's been that way
since the seventh century.

13:11.489 --> 13:14.493
So, do you really think that
a few special forces teams

13:14.494 --> 13:16.828
are gonna put a dent in that?

13:16.829 --> 13:19.831
CROCKER:
Well, what would you do?

13:19.832 --> 13:21.534
You offering me a promotion?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.638
I'm offering you a hypothetical.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.844
200,000 American troops
on the ground indefinitely

13:32.845 --> 13:35.946
to provide security and support
for an equal number of doctors

13:35.947 --> 13:38.015
and elementary school teachers.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.883
Well, that's
not going to happen.

13:39.884 --> 13:41.654
Then I'd better get back there.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.355
What else?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.857
What else would
make a difference?

13:45.858 --> 13:49.461
Hit reset.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.762
Meaning what?

13:50.763 --> 13:53.065
Meaning pound Raqqa
into a parking lot.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.316
Let's take 20.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.451
(door opens)

14:21.994 --> 14:23.829
You told me
you prepped him.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.630
I did.
He went off book.

14:25.631 --> 14:26.964
Well, you didn't stop him.

14:26.965 --> 14:28.599
We're sitting
in a bunker here,

14:28.600 --> 14:29.902
talking to ourselves.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.504
Good for everyone
to hear the truth.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.738
(groans)

14:33.739 --> 14:35.673
Don't worry about
our funding.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.608
I got assurances
from Crocker,

14:37.609 --> 14:39.276
State Department's
not gonna interfere.

14:39.277 --> 14:40.678
I'm not worried
about the funding.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.945
I'm worried about Quinn.

14:41.946 --> 14:43.683
Two years in the shit, Dar.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.617
What do you expect?

14:45.618 --> 14:48.053
(cell phone dings)

14:48.054 --> 14:52.057
(sighs)

14:52.058 --> 14:54.826
Shit.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.462
We've had a data breach.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.432
In Berlin.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.877
(indistinct chatter)

15:13.713 --> 15:16.681
Another doggy-- two doggies.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.349
Ah...

15:18.350 --> 15:20.719
It's a dachshund.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.488
A hot dog;
we call them hot dogs.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.655
Aw...

15:23.656 --> 15:25.725
Give me a kiss.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.430
(chuckles)

15:36.802 --> 15:38.204
Well, your balloon lady's
a hit.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.204
Yeah, I see.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.806
- Uh, with the kids.
- Oh.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.211
During...

15:46.212 --> 15:48.346
asked me to check in with you.

15:48.347 --> 15:51.149
About the trip to Lebanon.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.651
Any more thoughts?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.753
The same thought-- don't go.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.721
He's going.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.389
I took the job at the Foundation
for a reason, you know.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.792
And it was not to be worrying
about security

15:59.793 --> 16:01.393
in places like Lebanon.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.860
This is a departure.
He understands.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.562
If he really understood,
we wouldn't be going.

16:04.563 --> 16:05.631
(doorbell buzzing)

16:05.632 --> 16:07.465
I'll get it.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.269
Mommy!

16:14.106 --> 16:16.208
(indistinct chatter)

16:17.577 --> 16:20.212
- Sweetie.
- (laughs)

16:21.347 --> 16:23.381
Hey.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.218
Sorry, didn't know
you had company.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.822
We missed you at work today.
Big stuff happening.

16:31.823 --> 16:34.627
Yeah, I heard, but actually
I've been kind of preoccupied.

16:34.628 --> 16:38.597
I've had a pretty amazing day.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.300
Sorry for barging in,
I just... need to...

16:41.301 --> 16:43.301
Can we talk outside?

16:43.302 --> 16:45.237
Sure.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.843
I got an e-mail today
from a hacker.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.579
I'm pretty sure
it was, anyway.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.813
It was encrypted.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.716
It turned out to be
a top secret document.

16:56.717 --> 16:59.584
Taken from the CIA.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.187
Wait, what?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.454
It describes a completely
illegal arrangement

17:03.455 --> 17:05.455
between German
and American intelligence.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.625
Germany's doing an end run
around its privacy laws

17:07.626 --> 17:09.795
by having the US
do the spying for them.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.695
That's what the doc says.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.130
Well, how do you
know it's real?

17:13.131 --> 17:14.632
Well, I don't.
That's why I'm here.

17:14.633 --> 17:15.701
I need you to verify it.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.535
I got the impression

17:17.536 --> 17:18.836
there's lots more
where this came from.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.741
That it's a test
to see what I do with it.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.142
Well, I can't verify it.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.744
- Not 100%, I know, but...
- No...

17:25.746 --> 17:27.378
I can't even look at it.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.713
It would violate my
agreement with the Agency.

17:29.714 --> 17:32.284
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.086
I don't care how it sounds.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.554
It's how I get to keep
my security clearance.

17:37.555 --> 17:40.424
Wait, does During know
that you've got this?

17:40.425 --> 17:42.292
Yeah, he told me
to come here,

17:42.293 --> 17:44.230
so you could vet it
before I publish.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.197
You can't publish.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.766
At least not until there's
been some discussion

17:48.767 --> 17:50.200
of the damage you might do.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.702
What about the damage they do?

17:51.703 --> 17:53.470
These security agencies
with their illegal bullshit.

17:53.471 --> 17:54.340
What about that?

17:54.341 --> 17:56.474
Oh.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.778
You can take the girl
out of the CIA, but...

17:58.779 --> 18:00.813
you know.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.134
(quietly):
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

18:44.657 --> 18:46.459
So, do you forgive me?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.862
For letting a vampire
into our house?

18:50.863 --> 18:53.164
That was real brave of you,

18:53.165 --> 18:55.334
running off into the next room,
by the way.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.168
I didn't run.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.572
Maybe not a full sprint.
(chuckles)

19:03.509 --> 19:07.278
Today started out so well.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.281
It's like my old life came back.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.352
Everything I moved here
to get away from.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.189
So don't let it.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.159
I don't want to be
in that world.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.597
I want to be here
with you and Franny.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.435
Did you hear me?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.305
I saw your mouth move.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.173
You don't have to vet
secret documents.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.708
You don't have
to go to Lebanon.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.712
You don't have
to do any of that, Carrie.

19:39.713 --> 19:42.314
Not if you don't want to.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.220
Really?

20:09.550 --> 20:10.969
_

20:11.004 --> 20:12.411
(buzzer blares)

20:13.779 --> 20:16.081
She'll see you now.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.756
Carrie.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.090
(door closes)

20:26.091 --> 20:27.458
Hi.

20:27.459 --> 20:28.760
Hi.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.428
I was wondering

20:30.429 --> 20:32.598
when me might run
into each other.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.365
I know, I know.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.167
I should've called sooner.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.468
No, I get it.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.804
Life's complicated.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.540
Hey, congratulations.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.241
I know you really wanted Berlin.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.778
After what we went
through in Baghdad,

20:45.779 --> 20:47.145
can you blame me?

20:47.146 --> 20:48.646
Yeah, but...

20:48.647 --> 20:51.281
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

20:51.282 --> 20:54.086
So, your e-mail said
you're off to Syria.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.653
Um, Lebanon, actually.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.388
The border.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.389
Otto During's decided to visit
General Alladia Camp.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.124
We leave in a couple days.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.459
You think that's a good idea,

21:02.460 --> 21:04.663
marching a billionaire
into a war zone?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.431
No. He's going anyway.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.100
So what do you want from me?

21:08.101 --> 21:11.536
Advice, to start.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.671
Well, it's no secret all hell's
breaking loose down there.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.406
I've heard all kinds
of numbers thrown around.

21:16.407 --> 21:18.477
Just how many militias
are we talking about?

21:18.478 --> 21:20.111
Over a thousand.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.281
12 of them significant,
including the Islamic State.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.781
What about Hezbollah?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.585
Is Abdulla still coordinating
security at the border?

21:27.753 --> 21:29.722
Come on, Carrie.

21:31.657 --> 21:32.790
What?

21:32.791 --> 21:33.790
It's classified.

21:33.791 --> 21:35.158
You know I can't share

21:35.159 --> 21:36.729
that kind of intel with you.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.533
Allison, look,
I know that this is wrong,

21:43.534 --> 21:46.138
showing up here for
the first time, asking for help.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.474
It's fine, really.

21:51.543 --> 21:53.144
When I left the Agency,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.078
I thought it was best
to make a clean break,

21:55.079 --> 21:56.815
not be one of these people
who doesn't seem to understand

21:56.816 --> 21:58.716
that when you're out...

21:58.717 --> 22:01.453
you're out.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.155
Okay.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.389
Then maybe you can tell me

22:05.390 --> 22:07.426
what's going on
at the Foundation these days.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.396
What do you mean?

22:11.397 --> 22:13.364
You know what I mean.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.665
Who's During been meeting with?

22:14.666 --> 22:16.435
What's on the agenda over there?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.437
You're serious?

22:19.438 --> 22:21.339
You bet I'm serious.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.709
We've been burned by that
place more than once.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.310
Allison, I...

22:25.311 --> 22:27.177
Is it true he's planning
to identify

22:27.178 --> 22:28.747
our transit sites in Poland?

22:28.748 --> 22:31.249
I don't know anything
about that.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.418
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.853
Then I can't help you.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.822
I'm sorry.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.758
You let me know if
anything changes.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.794
That's it?

22:42.795 --> 22:43.860
Well, my assistant told you

22:43.861 --> 22:44.863
it would have to be quick.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.431
Yeah, but, I...

22:46.432 --> 22:49.634
Saul's due here
any minute, Carrie.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.636
A surprise visit.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.671
I-I should've canceled this, but
I really did want to see you.

22:54.672 --> 22:57.341
I-I know you two
aren't exactly... talking,

22:57.342 --> 22:59.276
so you might want
to head out the back way.

22:59.277 --> 23:00.546
There's a stairwell.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.360
(door closes)

23:36.448 --> 23:38.484
Saul.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.389
I was just meeting with Allison

23:44.390 --> 23:46.525
about a trip.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.664
Fine, I get it.
You're still mad at me.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.265
If I were mad at you,

23:54.266 --> 23:55.801
you wouldn't have
your security clearance.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.703
Wouldn't have a job.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.170
I didn't tank your bid

24:00.171 --> 24:01.373
for the directorship, Saul.

24:01.374 --> 24:02.507
Yeah, you did.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.242
But you know what,

24:04.243 --> 24:05.778
it's not even
about that anymore.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.646
Yeah?

24:09.148 --> 24:10.815
Needed to leave the CIA?

24:10.816 --> 24:13.418
Fine.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.487
Just don't go over
to the other side.

24:15.488 --> 24:19.257
The Foundation is not
the other side.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.392
During's family made
a fortune in World War II

24:22.393 --> 24:24.563
working prisoners to death
in their steel mills.

24:24.564 --> 24:28.499
So, yeah, maybe he's got
some karmic dues to pay.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.802
You?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.503
What are you atoning for?

24:32.504 --> 24:35.274
Keeping America safe?

24:37.342 --> 24:38.676
I'm not atoning.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.646
You turned your back
on your entire life.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.414
I'm just trying to do good work.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.316
Well, you're not.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.485
You're being naive and stupid.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.621
Something you never
were before.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.215
So your advice is, do nothing.

25:16.216 --> 25:18.282
My advice is, postpone

25:18.283 --> 25:20.584
or send someone
who's less of a target.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.589
But our security consultants
say it's doable.

25:23.590 --> 25:27.192
Then, by all means,
have them take the lead.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.196
You think that,
with all my contacts,

25:31.197 --> 25:33.598
I can make this safe
but I can't.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.266
No one can.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.302
I paid a visit to the
Berlin station chief today.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.838
She's an old friend
who knows the Middle East.

25:40.839 --> 25:44.342
She had my back in Baghdad
more than once.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.311
Her strong advice was, don't go.

25:47.312 --> 25:49.213
And you just, what?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.616
Nodded your head?

25:51.617 --> 25:53.352
If anyone gets in trouble,

25:53.353 --> 25:55.353
there will be zero help.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.187
Oh, well, then I agree.
Let's not go.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.755
Let's not publish.
Let's not do anything

25:58.756 --> 26:00.457
if that's what the CIA says.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.159
You know, this is
really getting old.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.560
The CIA saying I'm a traitor,

26:03.561 --> 26:04.830
you saying I'm still
working for the CIA.

26:04.831 --> 26:06.464
Please.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.365
You spent the last ten years
killing people.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.801
It's not enough just to stop.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.502
You need to do something.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.403
Maybe because of how I
spent the last ten years,

26:13.404 --> 26:16.173
I know that what you're doing
will get good people hurt.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.509
Saul Berenson arrived

26:17.510 --> 26:20.545
at Berlin Station
just as I was leaving.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.345
You receive
a stolen CIA document

26:22.346 --> 26:23.813
from a hacker, you said,

26:23.814 --> 26:26.750
and one day later
the European division chief

26:26.751 --> 26:28.818
leaves Washington to come here.

26:28.819 --> 26:30.787
Does that sound
at all serious to you?

26:30.788 --> 26:32.656
Yeah, it does,
because if he's here,

26:32.657 --> 26:34.424
that means the document's real,

26:34.425 --> 26:36.094
so thanks for vetting it
after all.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.563
I'm publishing today.

26:44.570 --> 26:48.105
Carrie, we are all
after the same thing here.

26:48.106 --> 26:48.773
Really?

26:48.774 --> 26:50.842
Yeah.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.381
I didn't tell you why
I need to go to Lebanon.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.649
Maybe it will make a difference.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.586
The refugees
flooding into the camps,

27:01.587 --> 27:03.253
they will be
without food and medicine

27:03.254 --> 27:04.690
by the end of the week.

27:04.691 --> 27:08.392
The governments
can't react in time or won't.

27:08.393 --> 27:11.163
So the ambassador came to me.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.366
I'm going to write a check.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.669
And then I'm going to ask
six other people of means

27:17.670 --> 27:19.804
to write a check.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.405
And they will,

27:21.406 --> 27:24.075
but only if I was there
in person.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.143
So it has to be me.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.578
It has to be now.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.080
The question is not
if it's safe or unsafe

27:30.081 --> 27:31.316
or monumentally stupid.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.286
Only is it possible?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.426
SAUL:
So this is the damage.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.610
1,361 files?

27:59.611 --> 28:01.778
Pending final verification
of the logs,

28:01.779 --> 28:04.581
and assuming the last
copy operation completed.

28:04.582 --> 28:06.583
Want to tell me
how our classified network

28:06.584 --> 28:08.854
got within a thousand miles
of the goddamn Internet?

28:08.855 --> 28:12.156
When we migrated
our secure servers downstairs

28:12.157 --> 28:13.724
during the remodel,

28:13.725 --> 28:15.761
some cabling
apparently got left behind.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.231
Apparently.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.800
Thank you, Mills.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.810
Please tell me I'm wrong,

28:32.811 --> 28:34.778
but it looks like they got
all the documentation

28:34.779 --> 28:37.516
on our surveillance program
with the Germans.

28:37.517 --> 28:39.684
You're not wrong.

28:39.685 --> 28:41.853
Someone know about
the program?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.521
Target it?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.622
No, it really just seems
to be bad luck.

28:45.623 --> 28:47.759
The documents haven't
been posted anywhere,

28:47.760 --> 28:49.527
as far as we know.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.827
So our initial thinking was,

28:50.828 --> 28:52.629
maybe it's another
intelligence service.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.364
Russians, Iranians, French.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.634
We could deal with that,

28:55.635 --> 28:58.703
but we went back
to the recruiting Web site

28:58.704 --> 29:01.406
where we first
encountered the intruder.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.342
He'd just posted this.

29:06.645 --> 29:09.146
(man speaking Arabic)

29:09.147 --> 29:11.350
Could be Anonymous,
some other hacktivist.

29:11.351 --> 29:15.553
The city's lousy with them.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.456
(sighs)
Whoever it is,

29:18.457 --> 29:21.691
I think it's unrealistic to
expect that this stays secret.

29:21.692 --> 29:23.628
We have to meet
with the Germans.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.795
It's already set.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.130
Good.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.266
They're going to shit.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.453
Can I help you?

29:49.454 --> 29:50.787
My name is Carrie Mathison.

29:50.788 --> 29:52.489
I'm from the
During Foundation.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.457
We funded the construction
of your gym.

29:54.458 --> 29:57.394
Ah, you must come back later
if you wish to see it.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.695
The men are using it
right now.

29:58.696 --> 30:00.432
Actually, I'm here
to see the imam.

30:00.433 --> 30:02.666
Is he expecting you?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.634
I'm sure he'll
find time for me.

30:04.635 --> 30:07.105
Sheikh Hafiz Al Haria
is a very famous scholar.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.708
Please tell him it's urgent.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.411
Please wait here.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.337
(bell chimes)

30:42.107 --> 30:43.442
ATTENDANT:
Sheikh Hafiz will see you.

30:43.443 --> 30:45.110
Follow me, please.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.585
HAFIZ:
Salaam alaikum.

30:53.586 --> 30:54.653
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

30:56.555 --> 30:58.723
Will you take
some refreshment?

30:58.724 --> 31:01.625
Thank you, I'll have
what you're having.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.728
Coffee.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.100
I need your help.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.802
We do, the Foundation.

31:11.803 --> 31:15.473
We're making a trip south,
to General Alladia Camp.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.475
I need to talk to Al-Amin

31:17.476 --> 31:19.344
concerning security
arrangements there.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.245
Al-Amin?

31:21.246 --> 31:23.214
The Hezbollah
commander,

31:23.215 --> 31:25.217
living underground
here in Berlin.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.821
Hezbollah controls the camp.

31:29.822 --> 31:33.491
I need to talk to Al-Amin
about safe passage.

31:33.492 --> 31:34.626
I don't know him.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.760
Well, of course not.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.595
"Every devout Muslim
is a radical,"

31:38.596 --> 31:40.499
is that what Otto During thinks?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.333
No, nor do I.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.168
But a scholar of your standing
knows many people.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.803
Among them, someone who can
get a message to Al-Amin

31:46.804 --> 31:48.740
in an emergency such as this.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.344
Allah.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.479
Sheikh, please.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.616
Will you pass on my message?

32:06.625 --> 32:10.061
A penetration... of
your secure network.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.663
SAUL: Vulnerability's
been patched.

32:11.664 --> 32:15.132
System's been tested
and found secure.

32:15.133 --> 32:18.936
But classified material
was accessed... and removed.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.506
And how does this concern us?

32:23.041 --> 32:25.141
A number of the documents
contained details

32:25.142 --> 32:27.045
of our working relationship.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.281
The surveillance.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.883
That's right.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.352
Which details?

32:34.353 --> 32:36.420
Pretty much all of them.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.924
The documents at this point
have not surfaced anywhere.

32:38.925 --> 32:41.325
They're still, in
effect, secret.

32:41.326 --> 32:42.625
Obviously we're doing
everything possible

32:42.626 --> 32:43.495
to make sure it
stays that way.

32:43.496 --> 32:44.995
Everything...

32:44.996 --> 32:46.896
except safeguarding them
in the first place.

32:46.897 --> 32:48.531
SAUL: No doubt,
we screwed up.

32:48.532 --> 32:50.266
But we all need
to remember,

32:50.267 --> 32:53.603
this program was a response
to a bona fide issue--

32:53.604 --> 32:56.172
jihadis finding safe
harbor in Europe

32:56.173 --> 32:58.343
while your hands are
tied by German law.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.646
That problem's
not going away.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.350
In fact, with events
in Syria right now,

33:06.351 --> 33:08.352
it's intensified.

33:08.353 --> 33:11.355
So what are you suggesting?

33:11.356 --> 33:14.226
I think we should continue our
surveillance on your behalf.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.296
Continue identifying these
bastards for prosecution,

33:18.297 --> 33:20.231
but with a
contingency plan

33:20.232 --> 33:21.933
in case any of the stolen
documents surface.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.267
"In case"?

33:23.268 --> 33:25.001
ALLISON: We don't know
who took the data.

33:25.002 --> 33:26.636
Quite possibly, it will
never become public.

33:26.637 --> 33:29.038
If you really believed that,
you wouldn't be here.

33:29.039 --> 33:32.911
You'd be hiding in your offices,
hoping it all blows over.

33:34.913 --> 33:37.214
The operation is over.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.250
That's a mistake.

33:38.251 --> 33:39.550
No.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.320
Trusting you was a mistake.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.633
These people
we've been identifying,

33:56.634 --> 33:59.237
they're a threat
to both our countries.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.439
But honestly?

34:01.440 --> 34:04.009
More to yours.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
Hard-core jihadis
right here in Germany.

34:07.547 --> 34:09.013
You heard him.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.347
We're out.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.884
Well, I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

34:16.087 --> 34:19.090
Whatever you're planning,
don't leave any tracks.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.094
I can't help you anymore,
not at all.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.540
It's a fucking war, and
our enemy is not quitting.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.576
What's wrong with them,
these new Germans?

34:38.577 --> 34:41.378
I know, they used
to fight like hell.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.147
You coming?

34:43.148 --> 34:45.181
I need to take care
of something first.

34:45.181 --> 34:47.050
ALLISON: You heard them
in there, right?

34:47.051 --> 34:48.453
I'll see you back
at the office.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.363
Well, I'm flattered to be
considered such a threat.

40:00.364 --> 40:04.002
I was part of the team
protecting Abu Nazir in Beirut,

40:04.003 --> 40:07.638
when you and the CIA tried
to assassinate him.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.341
I lost two of my men.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.613
We both have known losses.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.214
Don't insult me.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.016
You hunt us,

40:19.017 --> 40:20.551
kill our families,

40:20.552 --> 40:23.188
you keep us from our homeland.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.958
All that suffering
and nothing changes.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.362
That's one reason I don't work
for the government anymore.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.036
What do you want?

40:39.037 --> 40:41.270
Your help in getting food
and medical supplies

40:41.271 --> 40:43.408
to the people
of General Alladia Camp.

40:43.409 --> 40:45.909
The UN is in charge
of that camp.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.476
The UN may administer it.

40:47.477 --> 40:49.247
I don't have to be
in the CIA to know

40:49.248 --> 40:51.583
that Hezbollah is in charge.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.119
Otto During is planning a visit
later this week.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.490
He can't go there safely
without your invitation.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.959
Only the council can invite him.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.262
Well, I'm asking you
to make that happen.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.599
Surely you know the camp

41:07.600 --> 41:09.199
is overrun.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.501
Thousands of new refugees
are pouring in each day.

41:12.502 --> 41:15.106
You are risking
disease and starvation

41:15.107 --> 41:17.208
on a massive scale.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.612
Our strength is our suffering,

41:21.613 --> 41:25.282
and you provide us
with an endless supply.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.950
We know that
there are expenses involved

41:27.951 --> 41:29.952
in providing
additional security.

41:29.953 --> 41:32.054
We're willing to reimburse you.

41:32.055 --> 41:35.627
We can wire money for that
or deliver it to you personally.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.432
You killed my son...

41:42.433 --> 41:44.903
in Beirut.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.012
I will fight you forever.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.419
No, please, please
do not do this.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.988
I have asked you respectfully
for safe passage.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.658
You are obliged
to take my message

42:06.659 --> 42:09.394
to the council.

42:26.577 --> 42:29.480
I see you like to use
potassium chlorate.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.520
I know it detonates
more reliably

42:35.521 --> 42:39.424
than ammonium nitrate, but...

42:41.192 --> 42:44.295
the smell reminds me
of freshly mopped hallways.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.032
And hospital toilets.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.104
The visitors' changing room

42:54.105 --> 42:56.274

43:04.082 --> 43:07.884
Two minutes to prepare yourself
for paradise.

43:07.885 --> 43:09.286
(whimpers)

43:09.287 --> 43:10.989
Well, two minutes
more or less.

43:10.990 --> 43:12.924
It's not a very good timer.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.434
(door closes)

43:41.085 --> 43:43.187
(screaming)

43:46.324 --> 43:48.624

in the laws passed

43:48.625 --> 43:50.359
by their
elected representatives

43:50.360 --> 43:53.362
that they are not to be spied
on by their own police,

43:53.363 --> 43:54.397
they didn't mean
their government

43:54.398 --> 43:56.267
should use the CIA to do it."

43:56.268 --> 43:58.101
Sounds fine.

43:58.102 --> 43:59.368
Is there a problem?

43:59.369 --> 44:01.406
Nothing from
a legal standpoint, no.

44:01.407 --> 44:04.241
What's that supposed to mean?

44:04.242 --> 44:05.975
Maybe we should take a beat

44:05.976 --> 44:07.612
before putting it up
on the Web site.

44:07.613 --> 44:09.246
(sighs)

44:09.247 --> 44:11.416
She's been lobbying you,
hasn't she?

44:11.417 --> 44:12.549
Carrie has.

44:12.550 --> 44:13.917
What if she has?

44:13.918 --> 44:15.017
What's wrong with waiting

44:15.018 --> 44:16.352
until we at least understand

44:16.353 --> 44:17.355
the national security
implications?

44:17.356 --> 44:20.357
She's there with you, isn't she?

44:20.358 --> 44:21.625
Actually, no.

44:21.626 --> 44:23.392
Even Ed Snowden
didn't just dump everything...

44:23.393 --> 44:24.960
- (tires squealing)
- onto the Internet.

44:24.961 --> 44:26.128
That's hardly the same.

44:26.129 --> 44:28.099
This is only the one document.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.501
Jonas?

44:31.502 --> 44:33.336
You there?

44:33.337 --> 44:35.405
Hello?

44:35.406 --> 44:36.441
Hello...

44:42.480 --> 44:44.114
Fuck you, then.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.183
I'm posting.

44:49.987 --> 44:51.655
Carrie.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.990
Carrie.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.326
Oh, my God.

44:56.327 --> 44:58.329
Are you okay?

45:00.665 --> 45:02.466
Yeah.

45:02.467 --> 45:03.600
I'm okay.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.503
What happened?

45:07.004 --> 45:08.171
I just...

45:08.172 --> 45:09.973
Tell me what happened.

45:09.974 --> 45:11.309
I just want to go inside.

45:11.310 --> 45:13.009
(sniffles)

45:13.010 --> 45:14.212
Okay.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.544
(creaks)

45:47.912 --> 45:49.580
(box closes)

45:54.152 --> 45:56.453
How'd your work go?

45:56.454 --> 45:59.622
He's a martyr in paradise,
and I'm stuck here.

45:59.623 --> 46:02.193
The Germans aren't on board
for this anymore.

46:02.194 --> 46:04.494
They won't turn
a blind eye.

46:04.495 --> 46:06.631
We're out, too.

46:08.065 --> 46:10.600
I want to be sure
you understand.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.904
You'll get no support,
you'll be out of the Agency.

46:14.472 --> 46:16.340
No acknowledgment
if you're caught.

46:16.341 --> 46:19.110
No contact from today.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.646
You done?

46:22.647 --> 46:25.614
All you get is that key,
your next target in the box,

46:25.615 --> 46:27.149
and operating money
waiting there

46:27.150 --> 46:29.120
when you bring back
proof of death.

46:33.224 --> 46:35.358
She recruits kids,

46:35.359 --> 46:38.094
teenagers for
training in Syria.

46:38.095 --> 46:40.498
Sent out after four weeks
to blow themselves up

46:40.499 --> 46:42.166
in martyrdom operations.

46:44.995 --> 46:48.016
_

46:49.407 --> 46:51.074
You decide.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.441
Put their names in the box,

46:52.442 --> 46:54.612
I'll take care
of anyone you put there.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.354
(door slams)

47:24.075 --> 47:25.910
(phone buzzing)

47:30.648 --> 47:32.917
Carrie Mathison.

47:35.653 --> 47:37.220
Hello.

47:37.221 --> 47:39.021
AL-AMIN:
The council invites Otto During

47:39.022 --> 47:41.659
to visit General Alladia Camp
as our honored guest.
