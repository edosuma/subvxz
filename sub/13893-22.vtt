00:22.000 --> 00:24.040
Yea! Drum solo!

00:35.056 --> 00:36.776
Thanks for sharing the sodas.

00:36.776 --> 00:38.756
Yea man, thanks for sharing the tunes.

00:38.756 --> 00:41.146
Who's coming at ya? It's The Night Owl.

00:41.146 --> 00:43.596
Shut your faces! It's the Night Owl!

00:43.596 --> 00:45.596
Do you like cars? Do you love cars?

00:45.596 --> 00:46.606
If a car was a girl,

00:46.606 --> 00:48.986
would you take her on a date and try to get to second base?

00:48.986 --> 00:51.466
Then who's giving away a brand new vintage muscle car?

00:51.466 --> 00:53.636
W.H.O.Z, that too

00:53.636 --> 00:58.226
and you have to be the last one standing at the catwalk on the W.H.O.Z. Billboard downtown!

00:58.226 --> 01:02.286
But you got to be in it to win it, so come on down tomorrow at noon for your chance to win!

01:02.286 --> 01:03.866
A vintage muscle car?

01:03.866 --> 01:05.696
Just for standing?

01:05.696 --> 01:07.486
Freakin' Sweet!

01:07.486 --> 01:09.266
Maybe it's just the sodas talking,

01:09.266 --> 01:11.966
but I think we should work together to win that car.

01:11.966 --> 01:15.256
I don't know. We really never worked together before.

01:15.256 --> 01:18.596
Well maybe its time we cracked open an ice cold can of team work.

01:18.596 --> 01:20.276
FOR THE CAR!

01:20.276 --> 01:21.596
Yeah, we should!

01:21.596 --> 01:24.006
Let's do it, Babies!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.626
Hey, there, radio listeners, this is The Night Owl,

01:28.626 --> 01:32.856
comin' to ya live from The Night Owl's first annual Stand-Off for the Steel.

01:32.856 --> 01:34.856
We certainly have some ambitious people out here,

01:34.856 --> 01:38.936
but only time will tell who has the drive for the ride.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.546
Aw, man!

01:40.696 --> 01:44.196
I can't wait to shove a key into that!

01:44.196 --> 01:47.126
Dude, were gonna look so cool all up in there!

01:47.126 --> 01:48.466
Yeah we will!

01:48.946 --> 01:50.606
Is there something on my face!?

01:52.246 --> 01:52.986
Uhh..no?

01:52.986 --> 01:55.166
THEN QUIT STARING BRO!!!

01:55.166 --> 01:56.816
Save it for the contest Muscle Man.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.136
Alright everyone I hope you're all comfortable

01:59.136 --> 02:03.786
because the Stand off For the Steel starts in 3, 2, 1!

02:07.466 --> 02:08.985
Bring it in guys. Bring it in.

02:09.205 --> 02:12.756
We're not leaving here today without that car, so you know what to do.

02:12.796 --> 02:15.606
Yes. Send those other losers home on their crudy car!

03:13.976 --> 03:15.666
Were down now with the final four,

03:15.666 --> 03:19.336
but don't you worry whoheads because there still is plenty of contest left.

03:19.336 --> 03:22.406
Hey man, the take guy heard those final four talking

03:22.406 --> 03:24.616
and they're gonna share the car. It's over.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.616
What?! The contest can't be over,

03:26.616 --> 03:28.496
my ratings were just starting to get good...

03:28.736 --> 03:30.606
Bring in the isolation booth.

03:34.176 --> 03:36.556
How does it feel to be a part of the final four?

03:36.556 --> 03:37.696
It feels GREAT!

03:37.696 --> 03:39.406
- AWESOME! - Its EXCITING!

03:41.406 --> 03:43.206
Hm-hmm, and how do you make it this far?

03:43.206 --> 03:45.596
Working together, baby!

03:46.136 --> 03:49.086
Fantastic. So, what are you going to do with the car?

03:49.086 --> 03:51.206
- Share it. - Hmm, that's funny,

03:51.386 --> 03:53.656
because that's not what Mordecai said.

03:53.656 --> 03:55.406
What did Mordecai say?

03:55.406 --> 03:58.646
Well, that he was going to get the car for himself.

03:58.666 --> 03:59.876
Rigby said that?

03:59.876 --> 04:01.966
Yeah, that's what Muscle Man said.

04:01.966 --> 04:03.616
I knew it! That jerk!

04:03.616 --> 04:04.806
I can't believe this!

04:04.806 --> 04:06.566
Oh, he's going to pay!

04:07.086 --> 04:09.096
Well, let me tell you, if you really want that car,

04:09.096 --> 04:12.186
then you better make sure you're the last one off the W.H.O.Z. Billboard,

04:12.186 --> 04:14.496
'cause there can only be one winner.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.685
Well, we did it.

04:16.796 --> 04:18.276
- Yep. - Yeah.

04:18.356 --> 04:21.986
Guess all that's left to do now is step down and get the car.

04:21.986 --> 04:23.876
That sounds about right.

04:24.116 --> 04:26.286
Well, I'll meet you guys down there,

04:26.286 --> 04:28.746
I got to take down the tent first.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.796
No, no. We'll take care of the tent.

04:30.796 --> 04:32.466
You should go first.

04:32.466 --> 04:36.256
I'm not stepping off this thing until you three step off it first.

04:36.256 --> 04:38.146
What's that supposed to mean?

04:38.146 --> 04:40.616
It means I know what you're up to!

04:40.616 --> 04:43.406
You know what I'M up to? I know what YOU'RE up to!

04:43.406 --> 04:45.876
Step one, working with you was a huge mistake,

04:45.876 --> 04:49.436
and step two, get off this billboard. You smell like barf!

04:49.436 --> 04:51.326
YOU SMELL LIKE BARF!

04:58.466 --> 05:00.826
And now little insurance to make sure

05:00.826 --> 05:03.886
that this little competition doesn't end too early.

05:38.426 --> 05:40.206
You smell like BARF!

05:44.406 --> 05:46.026
GET OFF OF THE BILLBOARD BARFSACK!

05:46.026 --> 05:47.696
DON'T CALL ME A BARFSACK!

05:48.836 --> 05:51.376
STOP! STOP! Somethings not right!

05:53.446 --> 05:55.016
OH MY-

06:02.236 --> 06:04.526
How long have we been up here?

06:04.526 --> 06:06.806
Dude, I think were in the future.

06:07.176 --> 06:08.966
Aww, this is all YOUR fault!

06:08.966 --> 06:11.896
ME! You were the one who was trying to get the car for yourself!

06:11.936 --> 06:14.816
Yeah thats right, The Night Owl told me what you said!

06:14.816 --> 06:15.886
What did I say!

06:15.886 --> 06:18.616
That you were gonna trick us so you can get the car for yourself!

06:18.616 --> 06:21.426
Get your hand outta my FACE!

06:21.426 --> 06:24.456
I never said that! Thats what Rigby said!

06:24.456 --> 06:25.156
What?!

06:25.156 --> 06:27.006
Thats what The Night Owl told ME!

06:27.006 --> 06:29.816
But The Night Owl told me, thats what High-Five Ghost said.

06:29.816 --> 06:31.016
I never said that!

06:31.016 --> 06:33.636
Wait a minute guys, I think The Night Owl tricked us.

06:33.636 --> 06:35.396
Yeah I think you're right bro!

06:35.396 --> 06:38.506
Hey! Hey you! What are you doing up in the exihibit!

06:39.306 --> 06:40.676

07:27.456 --> 07:30.056

07:30.086 --> 07:31.806

07:41.856 --> 07:44.236
He must've built this museum around the contest.

07:46.246 --> 07:48.946
I always knew those guys were special.

07:51.156 --> 07:53.096
We gotta find the time machine!

07:53.096 --> 07:53.696

07:57.146 --> 07:59.506

07:59.536 --> 08:02.586
The Time Machine Exhibit will be closing in five minutes.

09:15.796 --> 09:19.756
You cant leave this place, I froze you a thousands of years ago.

09:19.756 --> 09:22.886
I made what you are and what you always must be.

09:23.036 --> 09:26.116
Ice cubes in my drink of success.

10:16.796 --> 10:18.226

10:21.936 --> 10:24.776
I Laxed out my student lowns for that car!

10:24.906 --> 10:26.566
You're gonna have to pay for that-

10:27.486 --> 10:29.926
That's for freezing us on purpose.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.806
Man, I'm glad thats over with.

10:35.806 --> 10:38.296
Yeah, that contest blew launch.

10:38.296 --> 10:41.136
Hey, you don't think we'll run into to our past selves, do you?

10:41.216 --> 10:44.376
Nah, you can't exist with yourself in any given moment in time,

10:44.376 --> 10:45.596
it doesn't work that way.

10:45.656 --> 10:47.396
Oh, okay, I guess that makes sense.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.286
And if it does work that way,

10:49.286 --> 10:52.796
we can always just fight to the death with each of our copies.
