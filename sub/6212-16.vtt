09:30.203 --> 09:31.671
Look, I'm sorry.

09:31.671 --> 09:32.872
I thought I could
go through with this

09:32.872 --> 09:34.841
but I can't-- I really can't!

09:34.841 --> 09:36.376
Hilda, get a grip.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.178
We are only making out
these wills

09:38.178 --> 09:39.345
as a precautionary
measure.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.614
You can't live your life
in fear.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.616
It's been working for me so far.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.085
Aren't you afraid?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.586
Don't you wonder what's next?

09:46.586 --> 09:50.590
Is this the last chance we get,
or is there a hereafter?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.059
There's only one
way to find out.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.261
Last call for the hereafter.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.098
All aboard for the river Styx.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.666
Okay, we saw it.
Let's go.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.835
Hilda... this is not
the hereafter--

10:01.835 --> 10:04.237
this is just
the boat ride over.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.172
Have fun. I'll be
in the Admiral's Club

10:06.172 --> 10:07.841
throwing back some zombies.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.909
Come on, now, you said
you wanted to know

10:09.909 --> 10:11.711
what it's like,
and we're going to find out.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.813
-Come on.
-Okay.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.783
Hello. Hi.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.185
( <i>nervous laughter</i> )

10:19.185 --> 10:21.521
Well, we are definitely going
to be the life of this party.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.823
Hey, how's it going?

10:23.823 --> 10:25.825
Not so great.
I'm having writer's block.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.094
For some reason,
I just don't feel inspired.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.730
Well, maybe I can inspire you
with a hot vanilla latte.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.966
Ah, no thanks--
when I hit these dry spells

10:32.966 --> 10:35.001
caffeine just disrupts
my concentration.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.437
Oh, and as your muse,
I should have known that.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.073
Um... so, oh, guess what?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.374
I found my missing sock

10:41.374 --> 10:42.742
and it's a really
interesting story.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.577
You'll never guess
where it turned up.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.180
My closet, of all places.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.883
I find the rain
is rejuvenating.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.851
Wow, that is awesome.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.653
Yeah, you know, matching
socks are great.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.921
No, no, no.
What that girl just said

10:54.921 --> 10:56.422
about the rain
being rejuvenating.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.858
That's perfect for a song.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.093
I guess, but, you know

11:00.093 --> 11:04.230
I still like a good
missing sock song myself.

11:04.230 --> 11:08.501
"Rejuvenating rain
helps ease the pain."

11:08.501 --> 11:13.139
But what really rocks
are my missing socks.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.975
I am so bombing out as a muse.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.486
Sabrina, I'm so glad
you're home.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.688
I need your advice
on how to be a good muse.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.924
Oh, well, if you
figure it out, let me know.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.394
Josh said that I didn't inspire
any of his photographs.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.029
Not even the ones of me.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.499
So, come on, share your secret.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.833
Well, I'd love
to help you,
but I can't.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.669
I seem to have lost my touch.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.238
Yeah, right-- I am on to you.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.639
You just don't want
to give away your secret

11:46.639 --> 11:49.142
so you can be the only one
in this house who inspires men.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.877
Well, let me tell you
something, missy.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.645
I have got a dress
upstairs in my closet

11:52.645 --> 11:55.281
that is going to blow you
out of the water.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.784
Meow.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.153
I love a good catfight.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.455
Sabrina, let's talk
estate planning.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.325
Here's my proposal
for dividing up
our aunties' assets.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.659
<i>Our</i> aunties?

12:06.659 --> 12:09.562
I get the car, the house,
the timeshare on Neptune.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.031
And you, you lucky devil

12:12.031 --> 12:14.367
get that one-of-a-kind
spider clock.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.202
Salem, I don't want
to talk about this.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.871
I hope my aunts live forever,
and I don't care what I get.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.374
Already took the liberty
of assuming that.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.176
Sign here, sis.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.645
Salem, I've got bigger problems
than this, okay?

12:25.645 --> 12:27.347
I've got to figure out
how to be a good muse

12:27.347 --> 12:28.514
or Kevin's going to
dump me for some girl

12:28.514 --> 12:30.416
who's more naturally
interesting than I am.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.618
I can't help you there.

12:31.618 --> 12:35.622
The only thing I ever inspired
was mandatory spaying.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.191
Why don't you ask a real muse?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.093
Why didn't I think of that?

12:40.093 --> 12:40.960
Hmm.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.396
Muses come quickly,
I need to learn

12:43.396 --> 12:45.932
the art of inspiring
before my roommates return.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.137
Please, watch your step...

12:51.137 --> 12:52.405
or not.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.507
Doesn't really matter now.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.842
Okay, I'm warning you.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.144
If you are even one minute late
picking us up...

12:58.144 --> 12:59.679
What? You'll kill me?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.147
( <i>laughs</i> )

13:01.147 --> 13:03.049
Too late.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.021
Oh, hi, darlings.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.123
Welcome to Sunshine Lakes.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.027
Now, be sure to sign in
and take a ticket.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.296
This year, we're raffling off
stretch pants

13:16.296 --> 13:19.399
and a whole year's supply
of peds.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.734
I'm Zelda, and this
is my sister Hilda.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.304
Oh, yeah, you're here
on the day pass.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.673
Could you please
not use the word "pass."

13:26.673 --> 13:28.641
I'm sorry, my sister
gets a little uptight

13:28.641 --> 13:30.276
when it comes to
the subject of...

13:30.276 --> 13:31.444
Death?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.679
I'm out of here.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.248
Well, of course
she's uptight.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.482
When you're on
the other side

13:36.482 --> 13:39.485
people see death
as an ending.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.721
But here on Sunshine Lakes

13:41.721 --> 13:43.456
it's a whole
new beginning.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.059
You're going to love it.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.127
Every night, we have
a picture show

13:48.127 --> 13:50.363
at the Jackie Gleason
Auditorium.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.631
A little tip:

13:51.631 --> 13:54.067
bring a cushion for your tushy.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.568
Oh look, they're showing

13:55.568 --> 13:57.704
the director's cut
of <i>Rooster Cogburn.</i>

13:57.704 --> 13:58.738
I love the Duke.

13:58.738 --> 14:02.208
Oh good, 'cause you're
sitting next to him at lunch.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.877
Oh, and the food is
all you can eat

14:04.877 --> 14:07.680
24 hours, day and night.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.150
Oh, and no matter how much
you eat, you never gain weight.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.185
Hello, heaven.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.553
( <i>laughter</i> )

14:13.553 --> 14:16.756
I'm sure you have fabulous
classical music concerts.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.824
No.

14:17.824 --> 14:18.691
But you're going to adore

14:18.691 --> 14:20.059
the Minnie Pearl Clubhouse

14:20.059 --> 14:24.197
where we have everything
from square dancing to bingo.

14:24.197 --> 14:24.997
I love bingo.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.466
Who doesn't?

14:26.466 --> 14:27.967
What's to love?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.135
There's no strategy.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.670
You just sit there mindlessly

14:30.670 --> 14:33.906
waiting for someone
to call out a number.

14:33.906 --> 14:34.374
Well, you must have

14:34.374 --> 14:37.243
some really intellectually
stimulating lectures

14:37.243 --> 14:39.712
what with Descartes
and Socrates
on the premises.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.382
Actually,
Descartes and Socrates

14:42.382 --> 14:44.817
gave up lecturing
for shuffleboard.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.919
They love
just relaxing

14:46.919 --> 14:50.156
after all that serious thinking
on the other side.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.358
And you should see
their apartment.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.494
It's gorgeous.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.163
Well, doesn't anybody use
their brains around here?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.565
What for? We're dead.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.701
Now, this is
what I call living.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.670
So, basically, if you
want to be a good muse

15:04.670 --> 15:06.472
like I was
to Beethoven

15:06.472 --> 15:10.376
all you have to do
is focus all your energy
on the artist.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.345
Sit with him,
talk to him...

15:12.345 --> 15:14.580
But what if I run out of
interesting things to say?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.316
Then you compensate
for that by catering
to his interests.

15:17.316 --> 15:18.918
Praise him,
build up his ego

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
anticipate
his every need.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.821
And you really think
that will help

15:21.821 --> 15:23.790
inspire a guy to produce
his greatest work?

15:23.790 --> 15:27.460
Ever hear of a little ditty
called Beethoven's Fifth?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.830
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

15:32.064 --> 15:33.266
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.501
Wow, thanks
for inviting me over.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.269
Yeah, well, you said

15:36.269 --> 15:37.904
you needed a quiet place
to work on your music

15:37.904 --> 15:39.539
and I figured my aunts are
going to be gone all night

15:39.539 --> 15:41.174
so it's the perfect place.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.241
You're the best,
you know that?

15:42.241 --> 15:43.810
Always thinking about me.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.711
Well, that's
the muse's job, right?

15:45.711 --> 15:47.647
All right, well, you
go ahead and play away

15:47.647 --> 15:48.948
and I'm just going
to be typing up

15:48.948 --> 15:51.150
my article for
the school paper.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.922
I'm sorry, Sabrina, can I
bother you for a glass of water?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.423
You know, I'm the one
that's sorry.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.759
I mean, as your muse, I should
have anticipated your needs.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.461
Water coming right up.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.228
Or, you know what

16:02.228 --> 16:03.362
I could make you
an iced tea.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.432
No, don't go to any trouble.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.700
But, you know,
I wouldn't turn down

16:07.700 --> 16:09.068
a half ice tea, half lemonade

16:09.068 --> 16:11.938
with a twist of lime and just
a splash of cranberry cooler.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.941
For some reason it just helps
get the creative juices flowing.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.444
And what kind of muse would I be
if I couldn't help you do that?

16:19.946 --> 16:23.129
"Therefore, it is
my humble opinion that..."

16:23.129 --> 16:25.084
Wait a minute.
Is it my humble opinion
or just my opinion

16:25.084 --> 16:27.720
and am I being arrogant
if I call myself humble?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.921
Hey Sabrina, which one
of these intros

16:28.921 --> 16:30.456
do you like better?--
listen to this.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.192
( <i>plays funky guitar riff</i> )

16:33.192 --> 16:34.460
Or...

16:34.460 --> 16:37.997
( <i>plays folky guitar riff</i> )

16:37.997 --> 16:38.831
They're both great.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.333
I think I'm going
with the second one.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.567
Okay.

16:42.335 --> 16:47.240
"And, therefore,
it is my strong
<i>feeling</i> that..."

16:47.240 --> 16:49.075
Oh, what was I trying to say?

16:49.075 --> 16:52.111
Why is it such a struggle for me
to write these articles?

16:52.111 --> 16:53.646
You know, I wish writing
came as easy for me

16:53.646 --> 16:55.681
as music does for you.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.182
Maybe I'm just not

16:56.182 --> 16:57.550
cut out to be
a journalism major.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.451
Maybe I should switch.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.752
Do you think
I should switch?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.121
-Hmm?
-Do you think I should
switch my major?

17:02.121 --> 17:03.956
Uh, I don't know.

17:03.956 --> 17:04.757
Is there anything
you like more

17:04.757 --> 17:06.259
than the major
you already have now?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.027
Well, I do like journalism.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.762
There you go. Switch to that.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.163
That is my major.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.865
Oh. Are you sure?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.535
Yeah, I am, Kevin.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.169
Who's my favorite author?

17:17.169 --> 17:20.740
Uh, Katie Salinger?

17:20.740 --> 17:23.175
It's J.D. Salinger, and no,
he's not my favorite author.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.343
It's Jane Austin.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.345
I talked about it for an hour
on the phone last night.

17:26.345 --> 17:27.914
Didn't you listen
to anything I said?

17:27.914 --> 17:29.015
Yeah, of course I did.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.950
You told me how much
you love my songs.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.487
And anything about me
you just tuned out?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.988
No. How can you say that?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.291
Half the music I wrote
was inspired by you.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.926
That's my point.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.495
You're only interested in me
if I'm helping you.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.430
Anything I say
that's not song material

17:44.430 --> 17:46.065
goes in one ear
and out the other.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.133
That's not true.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.734
You know, Kevin,
I really don't want

17:48.734 --> 17:49.802
to be in a one-way
relationship

17:49.802 --> 17:52.572
and I really don't want
to be anybody's muse.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.140
Wha... Sabrina, wait.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.541
No, I am so out of here.

17:55.541 --> 17:59.445
No, this is...
I... but...

18:00.913 --> 18:01.514
Wait a minute.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.549
This is my aunts' house.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.353
And I don't want to hear
about this in any song.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.124
I did it.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.826
I stared death right in the face

18:13.826 --> 18:15.428
and I had the time of my life.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.263
I also beat Descartes
at shuffleboard

18:17.263 --> 18:20.232
and I dirty danced
with Fred Mertz.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.802
Whatever floats your boat.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.170
And now, because of you

18:24.170 --> 18:26.973
I realize that death
is nothing to be afraid of.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.341
It's just one big bash

18:28.341 --> 18:31.510
full of casinos, canasta,
and kugel.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.414
Josh, I have been waiting
here all morning.

18:35.414 --> 18:39.285
Hasn't anything that
I have said or done
inspired you?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.053
Yeah, you just inspired me

18:41.053 --> 18:44.991
to make the best latte
of my entire coffee career.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.525
Everybody hear that?

18:46.525 --> 18:49.662
I am not just beautiful
and smart.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.630
I'm a muse.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.897
Look at me.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.299
I am a muse.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.734
Hello, people.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.768
What a glorious day.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.570
You can already smell
spring in the air.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.573
Your aunt scares me
when she's this happy.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.376
Roxie, you did
a fantastic job
filling in this week.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.611
Here's a bonus as
a token of appreciation.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.147
On the other hand,
it's kind of appealing.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.415
( <i>whistling</i> )

19:09.415 --> 19:11.751
Well, you're sure
in a good mood today.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.952
And why shouldn't I be?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.086
I love life.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.154
I love death.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.423
Like you kids say,
"It's all good."

19:17.423 --> 19:19.358
Oh, we've been saying that
all morning.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.826
But why am I talking to you
about death?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.428
You're young, alive and in love.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.296
Well, you got
the first part right.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.366
Turns out Kevin was
a little too self-absorbed.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.701
I'm sorry, honey.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.935
Oh, by the way

19:29.935 --> 19:30.703
when I die

19:30.703 --> 19:32.238
and you stick me in the casket

19:32.238 --> 19:34.573
make sure I'm wearing
comfortable shoes.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.845
Anybody know a place that
makes a good vanilla latte?

19:39.845 --> 19:40.913
Kevin.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.281
Sabrina,
I know you're upset

19:42.281 --> 19:44.216
and you probably don't want to
give me a second chance, but...

19:44.216 --> 19:44.950
But what?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.920
Well, I read your article
on college arts funding.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.954
It was terrific.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.056
That's nice,
but, you know

19:50.056 --> 19:52.258
reading one article isn't
going to fix everything.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.826
Yeah, well, I read
all your articles--

19:53.826 --> 19:55.494
uh, sororities,
animal testing--

19:55.494 --> 19:57.296
and they closed
the library
before I could

19:57.296 --> 19:58.964
finish the one
on the gas leaf blowers.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.367
Oh, I had the flu
when I wrote that one.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.869
Look, what
I'm trying
to say is...

20:03.869 --> 20:06.138
if you change your major

20:06.138 --> 20:08.340
journalism will be losing
one heck of a writer.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.175
You're not
just saying that

20:09.175 --> 20:10.142
because you want
to get back together?

20:10.142 --> 20:11.610
Look, I know I really blew
this relationship

20:11.610 --> 20:12.945
and if you don't want
to give me a second chance

20:12.945 --> 20:14.513
I totally understand.

20:14.513 --> 20:19.652
It's just, well,
you really mean a lot to me.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.788
And... well...

20:22.788 --> 20:24.490
Wow, <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

20:24.490 --> 20:25.758
You bought this for me?

20:25.758 --> 20:28.494
No, I swiped it
from the library.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.662
I'm kidding.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.698
Thanks.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.267
It means a lot to me
that you remembered.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.769
Listen, do you want
to go someplace

20:36.769 --> 20:38.237
after your shift is over?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.071
I'd like that.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.640
I bet you'd like it even better
if you left now.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.642
Well, wouldn't you
be shorthanded?

20:43.642 --> 20:44.744
I'll live, and if not

20:44.744 --> 20:46.112
the alternative's
not bad, either.

20:46.112 --> 20:46.612
Are you sure?

20:46.612 --> 20:47.880
Absolutely.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.848
Seize the day, Sabrina.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.784
Life's short... if you're lucky.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.128
Oh, I can't believe
those dumb broads

21:02.128 --> 21:05.664
just left a treasure map
lying around the kitchen.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.201
I'd expect it from Hilda
but a quantum physicist?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.338
There's over
$500,000 of gold

21:12.338 --> 21:13.839
buried in this dirt.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.174
Oh, Lord have mercy.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.877
I've hit the mother load!

21:17.877 --> 21:18.644
Thanks to the hags

21:18.644 --> 21:20.479
I'll be able to
blow this pop stand

21:20.479 --> 21:22.782
one filthy rich cat.

21:24.450 --> 21:28.053
( <i>sobbing</i> )

21:28.053 --> 21:29.655
Well, he was right
about the filthy part.
