<i>The first rule of negotiation:</i>

02:23.444 --> 02:26.448
<i>Never avoid eye contact</i>

02:26.514 --> 02:27.959
Of course

02:29.350 --> 02:33.696
A million dollar so that
the series number won't be consecutive.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.892
I think one more zero is missing

02:38.893 --> 02:40.463
<i>Rule two:</i>

02:40.694 --> 02:43.368
<i>Never show your emotions</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:47.037
I'm quite sure that I told you
It's a million dollars!

02:47.268 --> 02:49.680
Yes, you did,
but I changed my mind

02:49.770 --> 02:52.080
Cause, I thought
It's a losing business

02:52.773 --> 02:54.650
That's beyond my powers

02:54.742 --> 02:57.552
Why?
That's not possible?

02:59.446 --> 03:00.823
<i>Rule three:</i>

03:00.915 --> 03:02.715
<i>Never, under any circumstances,
say "No".</i>

03:02.716 --> 03:05.026
I'm not saying that
it's impossible.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.458
I'm just saying that
I will need some time.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.177
My cellular phone

03:25.072 --> 03:27.211

<i>A meeting? At this hour?</i>

03:59.106 --> 04:00.244

Can't you stick

05:26.360 --> 05:28.361
Did you hang up on me?
I asked where you were!

05:28.362 --> 05:29.896
Just got out of the meeting

05:29.897 --> 05:30.898
Are you kidding me?

05:31.932 --> 05:32.842
<i>What's that noise?</i>

05:32.966 --> 05:34.934
<i>- I'll be on my way soon

HEY

05:39.273 --> 05:40.308

05:53.687 --> 05:54.961
Is this right?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.664
Is he on his way?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.968
Things must be crazy with work

06:02.062 --> 06:05.305
He'll be here soon
I wouldn't worry if I...

06:08.469 --> 06:10.710
Oh, look at you

06:11.038 --> 06:15.248
I told you not
to trouble yourself

06:15.342 --> 06:17.845
Why don't you
go lie down, darling?

06:18.312 --> 06:19.812
I'm okay

06:19.813 --> 06:23.158
Don't be silly
You're sweating like crazy!

06:23.317 --> 06:27.663
Go on
We've got plenty of helping hands

06:28.822 --> 06:30.089
But I feel bad

06:30.090 --> 06:34.129
Don't worry
The two of us can handle it

06:39.700 --> 06:41.043
Get some rest

06:47.875 --> 06:49.786
Is that Seung-il?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.885
Look in on the boy
Help him get back to sleep

06:53.347 --> 06:55.793
He always does this
whenever I try to do some work

06:55.883 --> 07:00.052
Well, he is a good son
Doesn't want mommy to work

07:00.053 --> 07:02.889
Can you take over from me?

07:02.890 --> 07:06.030
Just leave it to me

07:07.194 --> 07:12.143
Women must have children
to earn respect

07:13.100 --> 07:16.843
These are all burnt

07:17.204 --> 07:18.808
Did you make these?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.474
Oh, boy...

07:21.475 --> 07:24.046
You can't eat these

07:26.046 --> 07:29.926
<i>Tianjin Military Airfield, China</i>

<i>North Korean Vice Foreign Minister</i>

07:43.464 --> 07:44.602

07:45.599 --> 07:49.877
We'll soon be flying here

Target in sight.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.762
Ready

08:48.362 --> 08:49.466
Fire!

09:18.659 --> 09:22.630
Doesn't he have
any sense of responsibility?

09:22.963 --> 09:25.898
What good is raising children

09:25.899 --> 09:28.277
if you don't teach them
about filial duty?

09:28.468 --> 09:30.970
They've been married for years
and still no children

09:30.971 --> 09:32.177
I know

09:32.406 --> 09:35.148
Is she trying to
end the family line?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.749
He must be busy

09:40.547 --> 09:44.884
<i>Representatives of the nuclear
disarmament talks have arrived...</i>

09:44.885 --> 09:45.718
How late are you?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.164
About an hour and a half

09:47.387 --> 09:49.628
Your wife must be
foaming at the mouth

09:50.724 --> 09:53.170
That's not the problem

09:53.527 --> 09:55.598
It's my mother's 70th birthday

09:56.029 --> 09:57.201
Step on it, will ya?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.227
Mother

10:25.325 --> 10:29.535
Perhaps we should start
Guests are starving

10:30.163 --> 10:34.077
How can I start
without my oldest son?

10:34.368 --> 10:37.315
You wouldn't be childless
if you had any sense

10:38.171 --> 10:39.844
I am so sorry
I'm late

10:40.440 --> 10:41.680
My Son!

10:43.076 --> 10:45.147
What took you so long?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.580
The traffic was terrible

10:47.581 --> 10:48.814
My Poor boy

10:48.815 --> 10:49.782
I'm hungry, mom

10:49.783 --> 10:52.457
Let's go inside

10:52.552 --> 10:55.032
Look at the time!
You must be starving

11:04.531 --> 11:05.703
Are you happy?

11:07.067 --> 11:10.207
How can you be acting
as if nothing happened?

11:10.570 --> 11:13.806
Well, the meeting
went on for hours

11:13.807 --> 11:15.115
Forget it

11:15.175 --> 11:17.883
I'm not in the mood for that

11:19.046 --> 11:20.320
Just eat your supper

11:23.250 --> 11:24.923
Do we have the coordinates?

11:26.853 --> 11:27.923
Any survivors?

11:28.255 --> 11:29.255
None

11:29.256 --> 11:31.357
Did you place a flying ban
during the hour?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.191
Yes, sir

11:32.192 --> 11:34.794
There were no other
aircraft in the area

11:34.795 --> 11:35.705
What does the Navy say?

11:35.796 --> 11:39.676
Nothing out of ordinary
was detected

11:40.133 --> 11:43.069
We have confirmation that
it was a ground-to-air missile

11:43.070 --> 11:44.174
What are the coordinates?

11:44.271 --> 11:45.978
It's a building near
Seongnam airfield

11:49.009 --> 11:50.386
We're on the rooftop
Clear

11:51.778 --> 11:52.950

<i>Check</i>

12:11.098 --> 12:12.168
Go

12:21.441 --> 12:23.142
Is it my fault that
we don't have children?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.645
<i>The first rule of negotiation:</i>

12:24.745 --> 12:27.988
<i>Never avoid eye contact</i>

12:28.248 --> 12:29.693
What are you staring at?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.890
Well, talk to me

12:35.188 --> 12:36.895
<i>Rule two:</i>

12:36.957 --> 12:40.097
<i>Never show your emotions</i>

12:40.227 --> 12:41.797
What good is having a husband?

12:42.129 --> 12:45.736
When he is always
away on business

12:46.867 --> 12:49.969
How am I supposed to make a baby
all on my own?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.313
<i>Rule three:</i>

12:51.371 --> 12:53.539
<i>Never say "No"</i>

12:53.540 --> 12:55.019
You know best

12:55.108 --> 12:57.452
Are you even listening to me?

12:57.611 --> 13:01.024
Why should I put up
with this crap?

13:01.982 --> 13:05.623
How can I have a child
without a father?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.320
I'm so sorry, sweetheart
I'll do better

13:08.321 --> 13:10.028
Forget it

13:11.825 --> 13:15.238
I've had enough
and I can't take it anymore

13:15.295 --> 13:17.468
No more

13:18.431 --> 13:19.842
<i>Rule four:</i>

13:19.933 --> 13:22.379
<i>If all else fails,
resort to force</i>

13:22.469 --> 13:23.447
Baby...

13:30.076 --> 13:34.252
You always try to
get off the hook like that

13:35.549 --> 13:37.324
Well, it's not going to work
this time

13:38.652 --> 13:39.722
<i>But</i>

13:39.820 --> 13:41.322
<i>wives are an exception</i>

13:47.794 --> 13:50.496
There seems to be information
that Baek Seol-hui

13:50.497 --> 13:54.070
who's in Thailand has been in contact
with people from South Korea

13:54.267 --> 13:56.406
Is this related to
the recent terror attack?

13:56.536 --> 13:57.981
It would seem so

13:58.305 --> 14:00.251
Please follow me

14:01.641 --> 14:03.052
It was North Korea

14:03.143 --> 14:04.884
Their typical tactics

14:04.978 --> 14:07.151
First make a friendly gesture

14:07.380 --> 14:08.825
then strike!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.359
Making it a popular dating spot

14:11.484 --> 14:14.556
Who the hell was it?
North Koreans or the Americans?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.224
We're still trying to confirm

14:16.389 --> 14:20.098
We've detected suspicious movements
on Baek Seol-hui's side

14:20.994 --> 14:24.965
In Beijing, they're planning
an independent operation

14:25.465 --> 14:26.944
What about South Korea?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.979
They don't seem to know
what to do

14:30.303 --> 14:35.446
Can't do a thing on their own,
can they?

14:37.944 --> 14:40.254
Baek Seol-hui?

14:40.313 --> 14:43.851
She is the daughter of
the deceased North Korean minister

14:44.217 --> 14:46.527
She requested asylum
in South Korea

14:46.653 --> 14:48.754
We assume she knows something

14:48.755 --> 14:51.201
about the airplane bombing

14:51.291 --> 14:52.793
Where is she now?

14:52.893 --> 14:57.137
In Thailand,
attending an energy conference

14:57.230 --> 14:59.732
Why aren't we bringing her over?

14:59.733 --> 15:03.613
She is under a heavy surveillance
by the North Koreans

15:05.872 --> 15:08.207
Shouldn't we reschedule
the six-party talks?

15:08.208 --> 15:11.655
No
We must stick to the original plan

15:11.745 --> 15:14.313
But we have so little time

15:14.314 --> 15:17.090
Launch Sejong Trading

15:18.084 --> 15:22.087
<i>Last night, an Air Force training jet
crashed near Seongnam</i>

15:22.088 --> 15:24.123
<i>due to a suspected
mechanical problem</i>

15:24.124 --> 15:28.260
<i>It is reported that
the crashed aircraft</i>

15:28.261 --> 15:31.196
<i>attempted to make
an emergency landing</i>

15:31.197 --> 15:33.265
<i>but subsequently failed and
crashed into a mountain</i>

15:33.266 --> 15:35.371
Great job

15:35.702 --> 15:38.239
Wasting tax-payers' money
on a fight in a foreign country

15:38.338 --> 15:39.442
Sorry, sir

15:39.539 --> 15:42.019
We have a new package

15:42.208 --> 15:43.482
Bring in Kim

15:43.610 --> 15:44.645
Sir...

15:44.778 --> 15:45.544
What?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.957
He took a day-off
for an important family matter

15:48.048 --> 15:50.619
More important that
the national security?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.492
I'm afraid so

15:52.552 --> 15:54.793
In many infertility cases,

15:54.888 --> 15:57.835
the problem often lies
with the husband

15:58.224 --> 16:00.397
Let's start with a semen analysis

16:00.527 --> 16:01.733
Semen analysis?

16:01.962 --> 16:02.872
Yes

16:03.296 --> 16:04.468
You mean now?

16:05.065 --> 16:06.043
Sure

16:08.101 --> 16:09.944
I really think I'm fine

16:10.070 --> 16:14.280
How can you be sure
unless you're tested?

16:26.019 --> 16:28.056
Is this the best we can do?
In this day and age?

16:28.154 --> 16:29.963
Just focus on doing your job right

16:40.066 --> 16:41.272
Hey! Open the door

16:41.368 --> 16:42.201
Who is it?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.272
It's me

16:46.039 --> 16:47.177
What are you doing?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.174
- Hello
- Open the damn door

16:49.175 --> 16:51.587
- Good morning, sir

16:52.879 --> 16:54.756
<i>SPERM COLLECTION ROOM</i>

17:13.566 --> 17:14.771

17:37.891 --> 17:41.031
Whoa, wait!

17:58.445 --> 18:00.982
They could do with an update

18:14.160 --> 18:16.436
Oh, you're not done yet

18:27.907 --> 18:28.817
Pardon?

18:28.908 --> 18:30.945
<i>What the hell are you doing there?</i>

18:33.179 --> 18:34.419
For crying out loud,

18:36.583 --> 18:37.926
I'm trying to have a kid
That's what

18:38.184 --> 18:39.785
<i>Why bother?
Get a dog</i>

18:39.786 --> 18:40.752
What?

18:40.753 --> 18:41.993
<i>Get yourself a dog</i>

18:42.288 --> 18:45.497
<i>Life's a bitch for all men
living in this country</i>

18:45.592 --> 18:49.962
<i>First your wife will spend
all your money on bags and shoes</i>

18:49.963 --> 18:50.729
<i>Later, when the kids come along</i>

18:50.730 --> 18:51.930
<i>URGENT MISSION
it's not even funny</i>

18:51.931 --> 18:53.410
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

18:53.733 --> 18:55.474
Didn't I say no hand-written receipts?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.271
I put my life on the line
for this job

18:59.272 --> 19:00.873
<i>It's taxpayers' hard-earned money</i>

19:00.874 --> 19:03.616
<i>Maybe you should give me a raise</i>

19:03.710 --> 19:04.745
Hello?

19:05.979 --> 19:07.549
What do you think you're doing?

19:07.747 --> 19:08.817
Mommy

19:15.588 --> 19:16.588
<i>Stinger missile?</i>

19:16.589 --> 19:18.557
Launched from a rooftop in Seongnam

19:18.558 --> 19:22.335
They used radar homing
to extend the range to 10Km

19:22.428 --> 19:23.498
What's that mean?

19:23.563 --> 19:24.363
Professional

19:24.364 --> 19:27.368
That's right
At least two working together

19:27.700 --> 19:29.434
<i>A week from now,
a North-South joint declaration</i>

19:29.435 --> 19:31.506
<i>will be announced
at the six-party talks</i>

19:31.604 --> 19:32.504
On what?

19:32.505 --> 19:33.672
<i>Complete abandonment
of the nuclear program</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:35.584
<i>Establishment of diplomatic offices</i>

19:35.775 --> 19:38.756
<i>and the gradual opening of the border
for free civilian crossing</i>

19:39.245 --> 19:40.179
Reunification?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.480
<i>It's the stage right before that</i>

19:41.481 --> 19:43.688
And this happens
at this critical stage

19:43.783 --> 19:46.118
The daughter of the assassinated
North Korean minister

19:46.119 --> 19:48.292
contacted us from Thailand

19:48.521 --> 19:49.625
What does she want?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.589
<i>Political asylum</i>

19:50.590 --> 19:51.456
What?

19:51.457 --> 19:53.903
<i>We believe she has information
about the attack</i>

19:54.294 --> 19:56.795
<i>Only one week to six-party talks
and we're running out of time</i>

19:56.796 --> 19:58.070
<i>We must bring her in</i>

19:58.131 --> 20:01.044
<i>You are to ﬂy to
Thailand immediately</i>

20:01.768 --> 20:03.179
Right now?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.077
Hey, I'm out

20:07.273 --> 20:10.880
It took you an hour to do it?

20:11.578 --> 20:15.651
It's not as easy as
you women think

20:16.683 --> 20:19.596
Doctor tells me that
tomorrow is the big day

20:20.153 --> 20:21.757
Come home early?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.664
You know

20:26.059 --> 20:29.027
I have to go on a business trip now

20:29.028 --> 20:29.938
What?

20:30.029 --> 20:34.102
I'll be like 2-3 days

20:35.401 --> 20:38.075
Are you kidding me?

20:40.907 --> 20:41.749
Baby

20:43.042 --> 20:45.022
You're practically running
the company on your own

20:45.144 --> 20:46.812
If you'd shown a fraction of
this commitment to your wife...

20:46.813 --> 20:48.258
Baby

20:48.548 --> 20:51.116
Don't touch me
I don't want to see you

20:51.117 --> 20:52.384
I won't be long

20:52.385 --> 20:54.219
Don't bother
Don't you pretend you care

20:54.220 --> 20:57.055
- I'm only going to Busan
- You and your business trips!

20:57.056 --> 21:00.629
- Married to work!
- I'll be home in no time

21:00.760 --> 21:02.569
Go away
Leave me alone

21:31.724 --> 21:35.171
You're supposed to be off today

21:35.428 --> 21:37.408
He's away on business trip again

21:38.665 --> 21:44.138
When are you gonna try
for a baby then?

21:44.570 --> 21:46.104
I think I'll just forget
about it

21:46.105 --> 21:47.083
What?

21:47.507 --> 21:49.007
Maybe get a puppy instead

21:49.008 --> 21:51.545
Do you know anyone
who can get me one?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.064
You are okay?

22:06.492 --> 22:09.098
Yes, I'm fine
Thank you

22:09.462 --> 22:10.566
And you?

22:11.130 --> 22:12.302
I'm okay

22:18.137 --> 22:21.710
Yes, this Pinot Noir is very rich

22:25.578 --> 22:30.152
And, we have also two ice...
No no no...

22:30.316 --> 22:31.693
dessert wine

22:34.987 --> 22:36.091
Stop looking at me like that

22:37.357 --> 22:39.458
Would you like a drink, sir?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.802
- I'll have water, please
- I see

22:47.934 --> 22:49.208
There you go

22:49.702 --> 22:50.976
Do you have papers?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.648
Here you go

22:56.909 --> 22:58.354
Can I get an orange juice?

23:01.280 --> 23:02.384
Here

23:23.002 --> 23:24.379
Good afternoon

23:24.804 --> 23:26.215
<i>Name Baek Seol-hui</i>

23:26.305 --> 23:28.974
<i>She holds the key
to the recent bombing attack</i>

23:28.975 --> 23:33.583
<i>She might seem young but
she is a genius nuclear physicist</i>

23:33.679 --> 23:37.593
<i>and the brain behind the nuclear program
along with her father</i>

23:38.084 --> 23:41.122
<i>We gotta get her
before anybody else does</i>

23:41.354 --> 23:43.527
<i>She's staying
at Golden Sky in Bangkok</i>

23:43.856 --> 23:46.132
<i>The operation will commence at 4 pm</i>

23:48.628 --> 23:53.168
<i>Bangkok, Thailand</i>

24:10.483 --> 24:15.159
Comrade Baek, we should be
on our way soon

24:27.667 --> 24:30.273
<i>The cuckoo is in the shower
Commence operation</i>

25:02.235 --> 25:03.737
<i>Plumbing, check</i>

25:09.342 --> 25:10.742
Room one four one three.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.311
Hotel Golden Sky information
representative, Mr Kwan

25:13.312 --> 25:14.312
What can I help you?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.447
Something is wrong in the water

25:15.448 --> 25:16.791
Yes, I'm sorry

25:16.883 --> 25:18.750
We'll send the representative
right now

25:18.751 --> 25:20.162
Please, wait for a minute

25:20.419 --> 25:21.489
Check, please

25:35.368 --> 25:36.904
<i>He's on the 14th ﬂoor</i>

25:39.839 --> 25:40.943
Good afternoon

25:59.225 --> 26:00.795
All done. Good bye

26:22.748 --> 26:24.250
Cuckoo is on 14
Confirmed

26:24.417 --> 26:27.193
<i>Collect the bird on the 13th ﬂoor
and transfer to parking D-4</i>

26:32.491 --> 26:33.595
Wait

26:36.228 --> 26:37.298
on, sorry!

26:37.396 --> 26:38.196
Thank you

26:38.197 --> 26:40.040
Oh, sorry
Excuse me

27:27.680 --> 27:29.751
<i>Cuckoo is on the move</i>

27:32.518 --> 27:33.084
How did it go?

27:33.085 --> 27:34.621
<i>Cuckoo is on the move</i>

27:41.594 --> 27:43.870
Not a single call

27:43.963 --> 27:45.497
He's always like this when he's away

27:45.498 --> 27:47.500
He must be busy

27:47.767 --> 27:51.112
Hey, you know it's a new trend
for wives to have secret lovers

27:52.004 --> 27:54.314
Wanna check out the clubs tonight?

27:54.407 --> 27:56.045
I know a few good places

27:56.308 --> 27:57.480
Really?

27:57.877 --> 28:01.324
Why the hell not?
Maybe I'll pull tonight

28:01.681 --> 28:02.853
Great

28:45.324 --> 28:47.326
What just happened?

28:48.227 --> 28:51.265
I don't know...
Just the flying newspapers

29:21.961 --> 29:23.394
<i>I think we have company</i>

29:23.395 --> 29:24.396
What?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.038
What's taking her so long?

29:37.476 --> 29:40.480
Comrade Baek,
we'll falling behind schedule

29:41.013 --> 29:42.287
Comrade Baek!

30:06.539 --> 30:07.609
Seung-hyeon

30:08.274 --> 30:10.618
<i>The base has been ambushed</i>

30:17.616 --> 30:18.617
What them?

30:19.652 --> 30:20.460
Downstairs

30:20.653 --> 30:21.597
Come on

30:25.424 --> 30:26.257
Get out!

30:26.258 --> 30:27.134
Pardon?

30:27.359 --> 30:27.992
What?

30:27.993 --> 30:31.031
My luggage! Hey!

30:37.736 --> 30:39.306
The guard are gone

31:10.302 --> 31:11.280
Wait!

31:13.772 --> 31:14.716
Hey!

31:15.708 --> 31:16.618
Hey!

31:20.679 --> 31:21.817
Go!

31:28.520 --> 31:30.261
Thirteen floor!
Target in the cart!

32:07.259 --> 32:09.933
There is a gun shot!
Here is thirteen floor

32:13.866 --> 32:14.901
Yeong-hui, look

32:16.068 --> 32:18.878
Oh my god!
What are they doing?

32:39.058 --> 32:40.799
They must be crazy

33:33.178 --> 33:35.158
Look out

33:37.383 --> 33:38.691
Hold on

33:40.552 --> 33:41.997
Hang on, you son of a bitch

33:58.871 --> 34:00.405
Hey, police

34:00.406 --> 34:01.646
That's him

34:01.774 --> 34:04.084
I saw... I...
Get that crazy bastard

34:06.278 --> 34:07.882
He's getting away

34:07.980 --> 34:09.960
What a terrible man!

34:13.518 --> 34:15.192
Get him

34:16.855 --> 34:18.994
Oh my gosh

34:20.359 --> 34:21.496
Did you get it?

34:22.127 --> 34:23.071
Bring it over

34:25.230 --> 34:26.504
Damn it

34:28.699 --> 34:30.304
What happened?

34:31.370 --> 34:32.507
I don't know

34:35.239 --> 34:36.340
What about Baek?

34:36.341 --> 34:37.614
I don't know

34:38.577 --> 34:39.710
Was she actually here?

34:39.710 --> 34:41.520
Last time I checked, yes

34:41.947 --> 34:43.358
Is she still alive?

34:43.415 --> 34:45.656
I don't know, damn it

34:46.318 --> 34:48.297
<i>The CIA took her!</i>

34:48.387 --> 34:49.053
What?

34:49.054 --> 34:51.500
A coded text from the CIA
was received in Thailand an hour ago

34:51.590 --> 34:53.467
<i>I believe there was an operation</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:55.601
What are you talking about?

34:59.465 --> 35:00.364
Cuckoo

35:00.365 --> 35:02.641
Cuckoo... The rice cooker?

35:02.868 --> 35:03.869
<i>No</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:06.705
<i>It's a code name for Baek Seol-hui</i>

35:06.805 --> 35:07.939
How is the CIA involved in this?

35:07.940 --> 35:09.715
<i>It could be at the request
of North Korea</i>

35:09.808 --> 35:12.049
or it could be
an independent operation

35:12.144 --> 35:14.988
<i>In any case, they couldn't have
gotten her out yet</i>

35:15.047 --> 35:17.220
Where are they keeping her?

35:17.516 --> 35:19.359
If she is still in Thailand,
she has got be here

35:19.451 --> 35:22.125
<i>CIA South-East Asia Regional
headquarters in Satenthai</i>

35:22.254 --> 35:23.221
Shall we go in?

35:23.222 --> 35:24.394
No, wait

35:24.490 --> 35:27.937
<i>We're to wait for approval
from the Tile-roofed House</i>

35:28.227 --> 35:29.594
<i>We believe operatives
from different agencies</i>

35:29.595 --> 35:31.762
<i>are after Baek
for their own reasons</i>

35:31.763 --> 35:33.868
<i>Satenthai</i>

35:36.935 --> 35:39.245
ls there a face
that you recognize?

35:41.473 --> 35:44.976
It seems as if the North Korea
hard-liners were responsible

35:44.977 --> 35:48.823
for the airplane terror attack
that occurred in South Korea

35:48.914 --> 35:52.361
It's going to be dangerous
if you enter North Korea now

35:52.851 --> 35:54.558
But, we can protect you

35:54.653 --> 35:58.726
Has this been approved
by the North Korean authorities?

36:00.559 --> 36:02.903
The fact that you tried to get asylum
from South Korea

36:02.961 --> 36:05.066
has spread almost everywhere

36:05.931 --> 36:09.879
It's probably best
for you to rely on us now.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.182
That's most likely
the wisest method

36:15.440 --> 36:18.042
It's the Americans
who have Baek

36:18.043 --> 36:19.377
Then why aren't we doing
anything about it?

36:19.378 --> 36:21.915
It's between the two Koreas

36:22.748 --> 36:23.886
What are you talking about?

36:23.982 --> 36:25.883
If we start getting involved

36:25.884 --> 36:30.128
It could tangle things up terribly

36:32.758 --> 36:34.203
Please follow me

36:35.661 --> 36:36.731
This is Chirashi

36:36.828 --> 36:37.795
Chirashi?

36:37.796 --> 36:38.501
Yes

36:38.597 --> 36:42.602
High-value information leaked
from the Korean stock exchange

36:42.701 --> 36:46.012
Foreign investors are pulling out

36:46.171 --> 36:48.310
The airplane bombing
and kidnapping of Baek...

36:48.407 --> 36:51.411
North Korean hardliners
were behind them

36:51.610 --> 36:53.911
In order to consolidate
their holds

36:53.912 --> 36:56.080
they'll try to launch
an attack on the South

36:56.081 --> 36:58.891
This means war

37:32.084 --> 37:34.064
You took your time to call

37:34.353 --> 37:37.266
I've been busy
Where are you?

37:37.656 --> 37:38.862
<i>What about you?</i>

37:40.025 --> 37:42.631
I'm in Busan

37:43.028 --> 37:44.006
Busan?

37:44.563 --> 37:47.365
You must be having fun

37:47.366 --> 37:50.438
Don't be silly
I'm here on business

37:50.669 --> 37:51.647
Well, I...

37:54.339 --> 37:55.545
I'm in Gangnam

37:56.141 --> 37:57.142
Gangnam?

37:57.209 --> 37:58.711
<i>You heard me</i>

37:58.944 --> 38:01.754
What are you doing in Gangnam?

38:02.014 --> 38:05.223
Just chill-axing
Looking around,

38:05.350 --> 38:06.658
having a great time, you know

38:07.786 --> 38:10.665
You couldn't chill-ax at home?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.095
It's not the same, is it?

38:14.326 --> 38:15.532
Where in Gangnam are you?

38:15.627 --> 38:16.970
<i>Cheongdam? Apkujeong?</i>

38:17.529 --> 38:18.735
Garosu Street?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.032
<i>Where? Tell me</i>

38:21.633 --> 38:24.409
Since when were you
so interested in what I do?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.471
<i>Always and very much, baby</i>

38:27.472 --> 38:30.078
<i>By the way,
have you ever been to Thailand?</i>

38:30.175 --> 38:33.452
I'm a flight attendant
Of course I've been to Thailand

38:33.545 --> 38:36.287
<i>Of course...</i>

38:37.549 --> 38:39.119
That's great

38:41.486 --> 38:43.432
It's fantastic that
you've been to Thailand

38:43.522 --> 38:45.627
What's the matter with you?

38:46.358 --> 38:47.268
Oops

38:50.295 --> 38:51.171
<i>Hello?</i>

38:51.263 --> 38:52.139
Yeah

38:52.931 --> 38:57.107
What have you got in Thailand?
A secret lover perhaps?

38:57.736 --> 38:59.477
Stop it

39:00.572 --> 39:03.314
When are you coming home?

39:03.442 --> 39:06.980
Do you miss me?

39:07.112 --> 39:09.683
Just so I know
when I can kill you

39:10.982 --> 39:12.461
Unfortunately for you,

39:12.818 --> 39:14.456
<i>I've just got too much work</i>

39:14.553 --> 39:15.725
I have no time for that

39:16.121 --> 39:18.567
Are you the only employee
at your company?

39:19.091 --> 39:19.790
And yet, they pay you so little

39:19.791 --> 39:20.769
Hey!

39:24.796 --> 39:25.900
Small world!

39:26.164 --> 39:27.837
<i>Yeah! Hi!</i>

39:28.367 --> 39:30.347
Who are you talking to?

39:30.435 --> 39:31.345
Ice cream?

39:31.436 --> 39:33.677
Oh, thank you...
I love ice cream

39:33.839 --> 39:35.079
Hello? Yeong-hui?

39:35.874 --> 39:36.875
Thank you

39:38.844 --> 39:39.879
What the hell?

39:46.451 --> 39:47.794
HEY

39:48.820 --> 39:50.390
Oh, your phone...

39:51.223 --> 39:52.668
Hello?

39:52.758 --> 39:57.764
I told you all men apart from
your father and I are bastards

39:59.064 --> 39:59.597
What them?

39:59.598 --> 40:01.599
Hello?
I can't hear you

40:01.600 --> 40:02.271
Hello?

40:04.669 --> 40:05.647
Hello?

40:06.004 --> 40:06.404
Hey!

40:06.405 --> 40:07.004
That's okay

40:07.005 --> 40:08.348
Yes! I'm okay

40:08.607 --> 40:09.745
Has she lost her mind?

40:10.308 --> 40:11.412
So, where are you going?

40:11.476 --> 40:12.614
I don't know

40:13.345 --> 40:14.449
Go together?

40:15.013 --> 40:15.889
Yeah!

40:19.384 --> 40:21.295
Hey!
Where are you going?

40:24.055 --> 40:25.033
Where is Kim?

40:25.123 --> 40:26.891
He said he needed air

40:26.892 --> 40:28.292
What the hell?

40:28.293 --> 40:31.831
When national security is at stake

40:32.697 --> 40:35.940
From the airport you follow me?

40:36.268 --> 40:37.872
I saw a beautiful girl

40:38.136 --> 40:40.548
I thought may be
I should talk to her

40:40.839 --> 40:41.544
Me?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.710
Yes

40:46.812 --> 40:49.156
Stop smiling like that

40:49.448 --> 40:52.190
You're torturing me

40:52.384 --> 40:53.795
Goodness, please

40:55.487 --> 40:57.467
You got off the flight

40:57.823 --> 41:02.823
You worked and on the way back to the hotel
You accidentally saw me again?

41:03.795 --> 41:04.865
You are there

41:04.963 --> 41:07.409
Beautiful girl was there

41:08.366 --> 41:11.711
Oh boy

41:12.070 --> 41:15.017
What did I do to deserve this?

41:15.941 --> 41:17.443
It's kind of like destiny

41:17.776 --> 41:18.880
Destiny

41:22.147 --> 41:24.491
You're like a living piece of art

41:25.283 --> 41:26.523
Art

41:35.627 --> 41:38.301
This is a beautiful necklace

41:43.668 --> 41:48.344
I know destiny... beautiful

41:48.573 --> 41:52.521
you are absolutely playboy

41:52.978 --> 41:56.187
You've got it written all over

41:56.281 --> 41:59.626
I know a player when I see one

42:00.685 --> 42:02.995
There is something
I... I think tell you

42:04.155 --> 42:05.099
What?

42:05.190 --> 42:07.295
I was actually born in Korea

42:07.392 --> 42:08.359
Really?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.338
Yeah

42:09.528 --> 42:10.939
Where?

42:11.396 --> 42:12.602
Garibong-dong

42:24.009 --> 42:25.249
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

42:27.913 --> 42:29.085
Anything new from the airfield?

42:29.147 --> 42:30.683
We're still waiting

42:32.183 --> 42:33.992
Video transmission from Thailand

42:34.252 --> 42:34.852
What's that?

42:34.853 --> 42:36.298
<i>Kim sent it over</i>

42:37.055 --> 42:37.965
Who are they?

42:38.056 --> 42:39.535
I'm running a check

42:39.624 --> 42:42.104
<i>Kim must have found a lead</i>

42:42.360 --> 42:43.994
<i>- I wanna know who they are
- Yes, sir</i>

42:43.995 --> 42:46.730
You don't have to check the woman

42:46.731 --> 42:47.539
<i>Why not?</i>

42:47.632 --> 42:48.667
It's Kim's wife

42:48.767 --> 42:52.236
<i>What's she doing?
With another man?</i>

42:52.237 --> 42:56.845
Kim must be curious
about that, too

42:57.075 --> 43:00.579
What are we,
private investigators?

43:00.712 --> 43:02.646
When the country is
on the verge of war,

43:02.647 --> 43:06.789
Kim is shooting an episode
of a soap opera

43:07.218 --> 43:09.164
What do you want me to do?

43:09.254 --> 43:10.824
<i>You're asking me?
Bring him in right now</i>

43:11.222 --> 43:12.667
<i>If you screw up again</i>

43:12.757 --> 43:14.828
<i>I swear I'll fire you both</i>

43:34.412 --> 43:36.392
- I can't anymore, you know
- Okay. We're almost here

43:37.349 --> 43:39.659
Careful! Okay?

43:40.151 --> 43:42.529
You really gotta
look out for yourself

43:56.968 --> 43:58.845
Easy... Come on

44:04.843 --> 44:07.790
What the fuck!
He shut the door

44:15.420 --> 44:17.457
I'll kill them both

44:22.060 --> 44:23.767
ls there a fire?

44:55.393 --> 44:56.337
Kim

44:57.929 --> 44:58.839
Damn you

44:59.864 --> 45:00.740
Let me go

45:02.067 --> 45:03.705
Let me go

45:04.602 --> 45:06.013
Let go of me, you bastards

45:07.706 --> 45:08.912
Thank you so much!

45:09.007 --> 45:10.645
No problem
See you again

45:12.877 --> 45:14.117
Yeong-hui!

45:14.479 --> 45:19.553
- You only live once, damn it
- How much did you drink?

45:19.617 --> 45:23.429
Chul-soo, you bastard!

45:25.457 --> 45:26.590
Baek Seol-hee.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.366
It seems as if our guys
have seized her!

45:28.560 --> 45:29.660
Of course!

45:29.661 --> 45:30.696
South Korea doing?

45:30.762 --> 45:33.263
Nothing much
Just trying to search for clues

45:33.264 --> 45:36.302
The state's authority and
the military group are very quiet

45:36.401 --> 45:38.472
They can't seem to feel
what's going on.

45:38.570 --> 45:41.813
Complicated a country that
can't even grasp what is going on

45:50.482 --> 45:51.961
Hello

45:52.183 --> 45:55.824
Oh, hi!
You speak Korean well

45:56.054 --> 45:59.456
Then as we have discussed in our meeting
check the schedule and dates

45:59.457 --> 46:00.458
Got it

46:26.484 --> 46:29.522
<i>Baek Seol-hee, it seems as if
our guys have seized her!</i>

46:29.621 --> 46:32.756
<i>of course! No matter
how hard China and Japan tries</i>

46:32.757 --> 46:33.929
<i>It's completely useless!</i>

46:34.025 --> 46:36.164
<i>We have a long history
of experience</i>

46:38.029 --> 46:41.067
Are they taking us for fools?

46:41.299 --> 46:43.779
<i>What do we do?
Kim is on standby, waiting for your call</i>

46:43.902 --> 46:45.506
The Tile-roofed House gave us a go

46:45.603 --> 46:47.139
We're taking back the Cuckoo

46:47.272 --> 46:48.615
<i>Give Kim the go-ahead</i>

46:48.706 --> 46:49.377
Yes, sir

46:49.474 --> 46:50.646
What shall we do about him?

46:50.742 --> 46:51.846
Who?

46:52.010 --> 46:54.077
The jerk that fooled around
with Kim's wife

46:54.078 --> 46:55.352
Is he a terrorist?

46:55.513 --> 46:59.427
You wouldn't want to be a terrorist,
when you look like that

46:59.784 --> 47:01.457
What's that got to do with it?

47:01.553 --> 47:04.727
He is Chinese-American
All personal details check out

47:05.023 --> 47:07.731
He works at
AJ Corporation's Seoul office

47:07.926 --> 47:09.626
A Stanford graduate

47:09.627 --> 47:11.800
He's been living in Korea
just over 3 years

47:12.096 --> 47:13.864
In every aspect,

47:13.865 --> 47:17.244
he's a completely different
breed from us

47:19.037 --> 47:21.347
The educated ones are the worst

47:21.773 --> 47:23.411
How dare he make a move
on a married woman?

47:25.210 --> 47:28.521
It's the same
with all married couples

47:31.015 --> 47:33.621
The bastards name is

47:33.952 --> 47:35.431
He's Chinese-American

47:36.154 --> 47:37.599
A Stanford graduate

47:37.689 --> 47:40.924
Give her a scolding and move on
Women are all like that

47:40.925 --> 47:43.026
It's menopause...

47:43.027 --> 47:45.371
or the seven-year itch

47:46.064 --> 47:47.372
Have a drink, man

47:48.132 --> 47:50.669
Right now, you body isn't yours

47:51.002 --> 47:55.280
National security depends on you

47:55.740 --> 47:57.651
Think only about that

48:16.828 --> 48:17.932
HEY

48:19.264 --> 48:23.542
I'm the one who should be crying

48:24.836 --> 48:28.249
Damn you
Why are you crying?

48:28.840 --> 48:30.474
You're still young and capable

48:30.475 --> 48:37.586
All these years, I've been picking up
after you and I'm old now

48:38.750 --> 48:41.924
If I lose this job,
I've got nowhere to go

48:43.121 --> 48:45.389
I was gonna open a chicken place
when I retire

48:45.390 --> 48:47.563
but I lost everything
in the stock market

48:51.629 --> 48:55.304
All I have left to look forward to
is my little girl

48:56.301 --> 48:59.805
If I lose this job, I won't even
be able to pay for her college

49:00.738 --> 49:02.945
My poor baby

49:03.675 --> 49:06.417
Cut it out, man

49:06.911 --> 49:10.449
You'll make money and
put your daughter through college

49:10.782 --> 49:12.227
and save up too, you know

49:13.918 --> 49:15.226
Thanks, man

49:17.221 --> 49:18.393
Damn it

49:19.824 --> 49:21.895
What am I earning a living for?

49:23.861 --> 49:25.306
Check, please

49:29.000 --> 49:30.667
<i>It looks like an ordinary restaurant
on the outside</i>

49:30.668 --> 49:32.409
<i>but it's a cover
for the CIA': regional office</i>

49:32.737 --> 49:34.410
<i>Baek is being kept somewhere
in this building</i>

49:34.672 --> 49:36.276
<i>Proceed with plan A</i>

49:37.475 --> 49:40.183
I feel like shit
You alright, man?

49:40.478 --> 49:42.185
Put these on

49:42.413 --> 49:43.118
What are they?

49:43.214 --> 49:45.490
These are 3D x-ray glasses

49:45.817 --> 49:48.251
At the push of this button,
what you see will be

49:48.252 --> 49:50.087
transmitted to us real time

49:50.088 --> 49:50.998
Give me those

49:51.089 --> 49:54.791
The image will then automatically be
rendered into 3-D imagery

49:54.792 --> 49:56.533
So, just push this button?

49:56.627 --> 49:57.628
Yes, sir

49:57.962 --> 49:59.737
Couldn't you just say that?

49:59.897 --> 50:00.841
Give Kim a pair, too

50:00.932 --> 50:02.036
Yes, sir

50:02.667 --> 50:03.702
Here you go

50:05.003 --> 50:06.038
Let's go

50:13.745 --> 50:14.746
Hello

50:24.889 --> 50:26.527
Video transmission, check

50:26.691 --> 50:27.829
okay

50:36.300 --> 50:37.472
Cowboy in sight

50:37.735 --> 50:39.078
<i>Be careful</i>

50:42.774 --> 50:44.253
<i>We have North Korean visitors</i>

50:45.843 --> 50:47.254
And the Chinese

50:49.747 --> 50:51.693
Even some samurais, too

50:53.384 --> 50:55.830
<i>This is a spy reunion</i>

51:01.492 --> 51:02.470
Waiter!

51:03.127 --> 51:04.834
Excuse me! Waiter!

51:06.898 --> 51:08.969
I'll take over here

51:09.100 --> 51:11.080
Go check out the kitchen

51:11.202 --> 51:11.976
<i>Now!</i>

51:12.070 --> 51:13.208
Yes, sir

51:16.774 --> 51:17.275
Waiter!

51:18.576 --> 51:20.817
Excuse me
ls there any progress on...?

51:27.518 --> 51:28.394
After you.

51:37.829 --> 51:39.172
Just go

51:39.931 --> 51:40.530
What do you think?

51:40.531 --> 51:42.704
It's a beautiful restaurant

51:44.769 --> 51:47.978
Why did it freeze?
Is it broken?

51:48.239 --> 51:49.940
No, sir
Kim is not moving

51:49.941 --> 51:50.851
What?

51:54.112 --> 51:55.579
167cm, 48kg, 34-24-35

51:55.580 --> 51:56.581
Do something

51:56.848 --> 52:00.125
if you stop, it automatically loads up
data about the object

52:01.853 --> 52:03.594
Is that Baek Seol-hui?

52:03.688 --> 52:06.066
<i>No. It's Kim's wife</i>

52:08.793 --> 52:12.536
I've always wanted to come here

52:12.897 --> 52:15.776
But it's such an expensive place

52:17.668 --> 52:21.771
I'm afraid I might be
a little over-dressed

52:21.772 --> 52:22.807
Don't worry

52:23.474 --> 52:24.374
You look beautiful

52:24.375 --> 52:25.649
Oh, thank you

52:37.588 --> 52:38.692
One moment

52:43.828 --> 52:44.772
<i>Chul-soo!</i>

52:45.163 --> 52:47.404
The nation is depending on you

52:49.033 --> 52:50.273
Where is he going?

52:51.836 --> 52:52.837
If you'll excuse me

52:53.204 --> 52:54.114
Sure

53:08.085 --> 53:09.393
Hey! Kim

53:16.561 --> 53:18.268
Hey! What are you doing?

53:46.991 --> 53:50.029
That's one extremely dangerous man

53:50.127 --> 53:51.538
Shall we bring him in?

53:51.729 --> 53:53.003
I'll do it

53:53.197 --> 53:54.198
HEY

53:54.899 --> 53:56.310
You kidding me?

53:56.767 --> 53:57.871
We gotta bring him in

54:30.334 --> 54:31.234
Did you wait long?

54:31.235 --> 54:32.839
No

54:45.883 --> 54:49.558
I promise I'll get the son of a bitch
and kick his ass

54:49.854 --> 54:51.765
Can we please focus
on the mission at hand?

54:53.824 --> 54:54.996
Chul-soo!

55:01.532 --> 55:02.567
Chul-soo!

55:04.035 --> 55:05.309
Let's do this

55:12.777 --> 55:13.778
No!

55:16.647 --> 55:17.523
Stop!

55:26.457 --> 55:28.528
That looks good, too

55:28.826 --> 55:30.100
It's delicious

56:12.737 --> 56:13.943
There is a space behind

56:14.038 --> 56:15.739
Judging by the depth, it could be...

56:15.740 --> 56:16.810
An elevator

56:25.950 --> 56:27.224
An office

56:27.985 --> 56:29.225
Gotcha

56:36.560 --> 56:37.868
Are you alright?

56:37.995 --> 56:39.702
I'm fine

56:42.166 --> 56:43.873
Who the fuck is this guy?

56:44.001 --> 56:45.268
What the hell he's doing?

56:45.269 --> 56:46.839
That looks like restaurant waiter

56:57.381 --> 56:59.622
- Go! Check it out!
- Aright. I got this

57:10.694 --> 57:12.595
I'm going in now
Please look after my wife

57:12.596 --> 57:13.574
Huh?

57:14.665 --> 57:15.643
Go where?

57:15.766 --> 57:18.542
Where are you going?
Wait for back up

57:18.636 --> 57:19.774
<i>Kim Chul-soo!</i>

57:28.112 --> 57:29.785
What's the matter with him?

57:30.548 --> 57:32.459
Probably because of the wife

57:33.217 --> 57:34.059
What?

57:44.995 --> 57:46.167
Let's go!

58:02.713 --> 58:03.657
What's going on?

58:05.449 --> 58:06.894
We need back up.

58:07.418 --> 58:08.590
Back up
I'll repeat

58:08.919 --> 58:10.364
This is so good

58:10.454 --> 58:11.455
Move

58:13.924 --> 58:14.657
Cowboy's on the move

58:14.658 --> 58:16.035
Americans are on the move

58:19.296 --> 58:20.001
Come on

58:20.097 --> 58:21.075
Move

58:25.102 --> 58:27.048
Let's go
Contact headquarters

58:27.738 --> 58:29.342
Shit, everyone is on the move

58:37.147 --> 58:38.387
This is an emergency situation

58:38.482 --> 58:40.155
We have an emergency on level one

59:04.141 --> 59:06.747
What the hell is going on?

59:22.693 --> 59:23.626
Don't move!

59:23.627 --> 59:24.901
Freeze!

59:24.995 --> 59:27.305
Don't move!

59:31.368 --> 59:32.472
Come on! Let's go!

59:56.560 --> 59:58.403
Sir, they got us

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:03.977
Let's go!

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.609
I represent the Republic of Korea

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.172
You'll be placed under
our protection from now

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:11.474
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:12.977
<i>Proceed with plan B</i>

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:23.287
Check up!

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.323
Clear!

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.063
Cuckoo is gone
I got men down

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.737
I need back up state

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.311
Sir, they are on third floor

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:30.495
- Damn it
- Sir, look at this

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.463
- What!
- Third floor

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.238
Let's go

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:45.168
I apologize for that

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:45.977
For what?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.613
Mission accomplished

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.250
What about my wife?

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.424
She's alive but...

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:07.166
Damn you, wife

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:24.446
How many?

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:25.679
Four or five

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.994
Don't shoot

01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:59.582
Hold fire!

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.392
Don't shoot!

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:26.393
Are you okay?

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.704
Get down
Get down

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:33.771
Get down

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:37.277
Go

01:05:38.669 --> 01:05:39.647
Hurry!

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:42.945
Hurry

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.167
Hurry

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.015
Hurry! Hurry!

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:27.195
Are you okay?

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:29.660
Are you okay?

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.102
Good job! Well done

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.001
Great work

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:39.572
Well done

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.211
This is incredible

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:46.611
What is?

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.238
You know

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:53.983
Kim's going to be a dad

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:01.224
Wow! Bravo

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:15.705
Perhaps you should
give him a raise

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:24.952
What's she doing?

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.525
You know

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:35.086
He saved me at the hotel that day

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:40.564
and again, at the restaurant today

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.059
He risked his life to save mine

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.061
who?

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.462
Just some guy

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:47.874
What guy?

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.438
An incredibly handsome man

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.408
He is following me around

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.438
saving me every time I'm in trouble

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:58.841
like a guardian angel, you know

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.014
But why?

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:02.682
I don't know

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:04.650
He says it's destiny

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:09.390
He said it was love at first sight
He couldn't help but to follow me

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:10.898
Am I that irresistible?

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:14.256
It's not surprising

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.793
I've always had these men...

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:17.769
Can't hear any more of it

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:32.174
What's this?

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.678
<i>Congratulations!
You're going to be a father</i>

01:08:35.045 --> 01:08:38.549
<i>You should make a lot
more money from now</i>

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:44.453
Wait

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:51.363
Is she crazy?

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:01.871
What?

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:03.249
Stop! You can't

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:04.807
Can't what?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:08.620
You shouldn't drink coffee
It's real bad for you

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.224
What are you on about?

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:17.321
I just had a terrible dream

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:20.158
You were about to drink
poisoned coffee

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:23.125
Have you been poisoning my coffee?

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.059
What?

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.962
Since when were you so interested
in your wife's well-being?

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.398
I worry about you all the time

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.667
Yeah right! Do you know
how I've been these few days?

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.069
<i>I barely escaped being killed</i>

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.904
I hardly ate anything all day

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:38.716
because I feel sick

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:40.009
But the ice cream seemed fine

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.709
What?

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.189
Ice cream seemed to
go down just fine

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:44.691
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.453
<i>L gotta go</i>

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.620
Just don't drink coffee

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.627
Unbelievable

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:55.868
You're a dad

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.905
Man, you should really be
making more money

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:03.907
You're a father

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:30.465
Aren't you going home?

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:35.236
DS Chemicals is dropping like crazy

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.169
What? DS Chemicals?

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:38.879
What did you buy that for?
Idiot

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.316
They said they'll be exporting
tear gas to Afghanistan

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:46.952
That's called inside trading

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.245
You wanna go to jail?

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.145
We're not civil servants

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:51.647
We're quasi-civil servant

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.753
Where is Baek?

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.889
She's in a meeting
with the Chief Secretary

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:58.660
Not at the National Intelligence
Services headquarters?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.522
Apparently,
she requested the meeting

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:02.969
Her late father and
the Chief Secretary were close

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:05.733
They drew up the draft
for South-North agreement

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:08.738
Just wait and see
Something will come out of it

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:13.680
Hello?

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:16.912
Pardon?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.758
<i>We have new information
about Cuckoo</i>

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.986
<i>Bring in all the tourists</i>

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.959
Alright, class
Well done

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:33.289
Hey, what are you doing?

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:35.497
Where are you taking me?
Where are we going?

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:37.902
- What's going on?
- I don't know

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.304
Good afternoon

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:44.135
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:51.885
Who are you?
What are you doing?

01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:54.779
- What's going on?
- Who are you?

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.325
You've been through a lot

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:04.923
Let's start right away
We've got no time

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.366
Thank you for your cooperation

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:08.701
Yes

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:22.577
Mr. President!

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.944
What's the matter?

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:31.680
She vomited blood and passed out

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.491
The medical confirmed
that she died on the spot

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.527
I'll come right in

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.765
Cuckoo is fall down

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:51.001
Finally, cuckoo has died

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.813
Soon, we can start officially

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:58.079
the hostile M&A plan
attacking Korean companies.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.580
We have a problem

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:03.051
It's a national emergency

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:07.616
What?

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:11.030
We're placing you under arrest
for high treason

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:11.962
Don't touch me

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.233
Hey!

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.212
AJ Corporation

01:13:26.536 --> 01:13:30.609
An organization of greedy capitalist pigs
pillaging the world economy

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.184
Chief Secretary was one of them

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:39.983
My father sold weaponry to AJ Corp

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:42.957
in an effort to help tackle
the financial crisis of the fatherland

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.163
But

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:48.628
they just used him and betrayed him

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:58.711
Their financial firepower is
beyond your imagination

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.438
Their scheme is to maximize
the risk of potential war

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:03.744
and cause shares in South Korean
companies to fall

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.982
then buy off profitable corporations
at a fraction of the price

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:11.020
Like Lone Star did during
the IMF crisis

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.488
Their ultimate plan is
to run South Korea

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:19.900
The biggest problem is

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:22.726
that this is not the end

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:27.775
It's more like the start

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:33.264
<i>With just one day to go
before the historic six-party talks</i>

01:14:33.403 --> 01:14:36.850
<i>Susan's Nurimaru convention
center is bustling</i>

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.147
- with last minute preparations
- Everything will be alright

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:41.955
Let's hope so

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:44.581
Come and take a look at this
Share prices are plunging

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.423
Just like Baek said

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:50.259
Foreign investors are
selling out fast

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.021
No! My 70,000 dollars
will vanish into thin air

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:54.524
What's going to happen now?

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:56.291
Can't we just arrest the AJ Chairman?

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.125
You're right!

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.230
No

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:01.569
According to Baek,
there is another man

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.508
who will carry out
the last mission in Seoul

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.838
But AJ thinks Baek is dead

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.710
We'll catch the bastard ourselves

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:13.141
How? When you don't
even know who he is?

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.142
We've got Kim

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.453
Kim! This operation...

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:20.490
Where is he?

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.620
He went over to escort Baek

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:24.323
What?

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:25.822
Wait

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.366
Ryan

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:38.571
When did he leave the country?

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:42.279
Right after the airplane terror

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:43.845
And when did he get back?

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.146
Yesterday

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.351
Stop

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:48.515
Blow up that image

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.589
Son of a bitch!

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:55.162
He knew who Kim was all along

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:56.084
What?

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:58.787
That's how Kim
got tracked down every time

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.689
The terrorist attack
and the Bangkok restaurant

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:01.823
It was all him!

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:04.426
So he approached
Kim's wife on purpose, too?

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:08.307
I knew something didn't add up
She showed up everywhere

01:16:08.498 --> 01:16:09.704
<i>Hound him</i>

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:12.741
off the tip you got yesterday

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:16.305
We tracked down the number
where the call was made

01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:19.344
and went through the CCTV footage
within a 1km radius

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:21.015
It's this guy

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:24.423
I thought he was an AJ

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:27.556
But

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:31.999
why is he tipping us off
about A.J's spy?

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:33.861
Beats me

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.899
<i>Pier 6, lncheon Port</i>

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:47.907
What is that?

01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:50.344
No. 3, stop unloading immediately

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:08.061
Yeah! Yes, sir
Let's start the party.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.361
Wrap it up them.

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:11.666
Don't worry
There'll be no problem

01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:23.141
Start our own party

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:42.502
What have you got there?

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:46.169
It's nothing

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:47.397
A baby?

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:51.937
After being married
for 7 years, finally...

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:53.703
You're becoming a father

01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:57.314
- Congratulations
- Thank you

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:00.921
And the mother-to-be?

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.051
Just a house wife

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:12.422
She must be kind-hearted like you

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:26.938
You are okay?

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:46.558
Who is it?

01:18:46.656 --> 01:18:47.856
<i>I'm a Yakult lady</i>

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:48.892
What?

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.136
Mrs. Kim Yeong-hui!

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.235
Yes

01:18:59.635 --> 01:19:01.136
Do you have any idea

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:03.845
how your irresponsible actions
put this country in crisis?

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:06.007
I don't understand

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:08.249
Answer carefully to
what I ask you

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.621
You recently visited
Thailand, correct?

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:14.887
Thailand?

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:16.818
You did, didn't you?

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.730
You're scaring me

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:24.767
Did you meet this man in Thailand?

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:28.663
That's...

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:30.644
Listen to me very carefully

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.881
This man known by the name Ryan
is a terrorist

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:37.076
What? A terrorist?

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:39.074
Don't you know
what a terrorist is?

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:41.510
He's like best buddies with
Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda

01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:43.218
The man who you had an affair with!

01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:45.714
What are you accusing me of?

01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:47.349
You had drinks with him
and fooled around

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:51.298
and cried on his shoulders
How else would you describe that?

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.964
Shame on you

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.495
Anyway

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:59.331
Your husband, Kim Chul-soo,
has become Ryan's target

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.096
My husband? But why?

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:02.872
That's for us to look into

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:07.406
Anyway, he approached you
with an intention

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:10.541
Why else would such a man
be interested in a woman like you

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.142
For what possible reasons?

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:21.553
Oh god...

01:20:22.718 --> 01:20:23.423
It's him

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.370
This is a transmitter

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:31.036
Looks good on you

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:34.400
It's our latest gadget

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.009
Freshly arrived two days ago

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:39.902
We used to get glasses
but technology is advancing so fast

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.948
So I should wear this

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:55.294
and meet Ryan?

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:56.897
That's right

01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:58.861
Correct

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:06.634
Let's do this

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.916
Shouldn't we at least notify Kim?

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:23.518
You want him to kill us all?

01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:26.314
Maybe I should have gone instead

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:27.589
Shut up

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:31.230
My lord!

01:21:32.088 --> 01:21:33.499
Calm down, Mrs. Kim

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.558
I'm calm... I'm calm

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:39.470
Hi

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:48.815
- Hi
- Hi

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:53.119
You Okay?

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:54.279
Yes

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:56.584
I'm fine

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:07.499
sorry

01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:14.532
Chul-soo, you idiot!

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.789
Why didn't you tell me?

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:36.396
That you're married

01:22:36.919 --> 01:22:40.457
I didn't?

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.232
I didn't mean to lie to you

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.941
If it weren't for your husband,

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:50.406
do you think
we could've had a chance?

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:51.978
Oh yes, baby

01:22:52.234 --> 01:22:53.645
What the heck?

01:22:53.903 --> 01:22:55.507
If he wasn't there

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:57.912
then maybe...

01:22:58.741 --> 01:23:00.015
Then I should just kill him

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.618
Shall we

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:10.524
go somewhere else?

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.356
Where?

01:23:13.923 --> 01:23:15.664
I know a good place

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.778
Hey, wait! Wait!

01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:34.619
Wow, this is a really nice car

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:40.121
Is it a BMW? And... black
It's black, right?

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:50.463
It would be nice if you tell me
where we're going

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.468
Don't get too close

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.541
Did you bring a friend?

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:02.514
Friend...?

01:24:02.905 --> 01:24:04.111
Hold tight

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:06.242
Hold what?

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:11.420
Hey!
Step on it! Come on

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:31.865
Damn it

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:40.777
Get out

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:45.251
Move

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:58.292
<i>WIFE</i>

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.739
Why didn't you answer the phone?

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.496
Me?

01:26:09.098 --> 01:26:10.168
Who are you?

01:26:10.533 --> 01:26:13.241
Bring me the Cuckoo in 30 minutes

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.542
Or your wife dies

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:20.847
Who the fuck are you?

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.816
How dare you threaten me?

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:25.917
Besides, Baek is dead

01:26:26.148 --> 01:26:27.252
<i>30 minutes</i>

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:29.117

Hey!

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:32.124
Wait

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:35.932
- What?
- You gotta tell me where to meet

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.363
Ah, sorry

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:48.379
What's this?

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:49.778
See you soon

01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:51.909
Hello?

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.881
Hello?

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:57.119
Son of a bitch!

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.785
Ryan called Kim

01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:04.526
What?

01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.190
What do we do now, sir?

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:10.199
You're asking me?
Don't you know Kim's temper?

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:12.227
Do everything you can to stop him

01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:14.105
- We've got the coordinates
- Where?

01:27:14.697 --> 01:27:16.176
It's in lncheon

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:17.699
But we have a problem

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.804
What?

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:22.370
Don't move, you bastards!

01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:23.771
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:24.910
I'll open fire

01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:26.975
Stop or we'll have to shoot you

01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:28.243
Go on! Shoot me!

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:29.844
Come on, man!
What's wrong with you?

01:27:29.845 --> 01:27:31.256
Are you trying to
get us all killed?

01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:32.792
I said don't move, you bastards

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.792
Come on, man
Stop

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:37.088
Remove the magazines

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.698
Toss the guns over to me
Now!

<i>Are you doing your jobs?</i>

I'll make sure we get them back

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:17.929
What?

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:20.564
Man, my wife has been kidnapped

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:23.406
Your wife? How?

01:28:23.699 --> 01:28:27.613
I don't know
That Ryan fucker has her

01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:28.703
What?

01:28:28.704 --> 01:28:30.706
Didn't I say that something
was up with that bastard?

01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:34.687
I gotta bring Baek to him
in 30 minutes

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:36.183
or he'll kill

01:28:36.312 --> 01:28:38.053
Where is Baek?

01:28:38.614 --> 01:28:40.059
She's with me

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:42.850
But you can't bring her to him

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:44.023
I have to!

01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:46.460
Or he'll kill my wife

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:50.999
Okay... Where is your wife now?

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:53.471
<i>I don't know
He gave GPS coordinates</i>

Is it?
Hey, how do you know that?

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.043
I happened to be in the area

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:11.422
Oh... Why?

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:13.825
I'm at my in-law's

Good
I'll see you soon

I knew I could always count on you

01:29:23.826 --> 01:29:25.362
Don't mention it

01:29:25.728 --> 01:29:27.139
You're the best

01:30:11.707 --> 01:30:13.050
Can I just ask...

01:30:18.447 --> 01:30:22.486
What did my husband do wrong?

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:27.025
He stole something important

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:31.565
No...
There's gotta be a mistake

01:30:31.693 --> 01:30:34.262
He's not someone who'd
do something like that

01:30:34.263 --> 01:30:37.031
He's a good man
once you get to know him better

01:30:37.032 --> 01:30:40.309
No
He's a bad man

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:43.008
You're wrong
He's a good man

01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:48.977
What did you steal, you idiot?

01:30:50.479 --> 01:30:52.049
Oh my head...

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:58.462
We're getting a visual

01:30:58.654 --> 01:31:00.224
I think we're close

01:31:05.327 --> 01:31:07.068
Yeong-hui, can you hear me?

01:31:09.598 --> 01:31:10.201
Hello?

01:31:10.332 --> 01:31:12.039
<i>Hello?</i>

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:12.667
What's that?

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:14.238
<i>I hear you now</i>

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:17.576
It's a missile

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:21.509
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:24.889
<i>I just arrived, too</i>

01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:27.024
Holy Mary!

01:31:27.749 --> 01:31:29.684
<i>- Get me Sales ll
- Yes, sir</i>

01:31:29.685 --> 01:31:30.651
Thank you, captain

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:33.087
If anything happened to Baek,

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:35.227
<i>I swear I'll shoot all of you
right there and then</i>

01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:38.335
I'll sort out the mess with my life

01:31:47.603 --> 01:31:48.741
I'm sorry, Miss Baek

01:31:48.904 --> 01:31:50.110
But I'll keep you safe

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.879
Trust me

01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:54.679
It's curious

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:55.610
Pardon?

01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:58.057
How do they know that I'm not dead?

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.559
I thought AJ believes
that I was killed

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:05.763
Who called you the day before yesterday?

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:12.063
We are set
Everyone is in Busan

01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:17.944
We don't worry about
the just get the money ready

01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:20.568
Did you hear that?
It's Busan

01:32:20.569 --> 01:32:21.369
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:22.644
She says Busan

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:25.810
Busan? Why Busan?

01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:30.149
The six-party talk

01:32:30.679 --> 01:32:32.716
Put Susan's Nurimaru on the line

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:34.048
<i>What?</i>

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:35.516
Nurimaru is the target

01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:36.784
We've got to get
everyone out of there

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:38.992
<i>Cancel the talks immediately</i>

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.863
Damn

01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:43.192
Put Busan Nurimaru on the line

01:32:43.392 --> 01:32:44.825
And get everyone out of there

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:46.635
- Now!
- Yes, sir

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:05.713
My god...
This looks like a missile

01:33:05.714 --> 01:33:06.784
Cool, isn't it?

01:33:07.215 --> 01:33:08.592
<i>Isn't this a missile?</i>

01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:10.664
Is it real?

01:33:13.555 --> 01:33:17.833
Where will you shoot this?

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:19.866
To Pyongyang

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:21.705
Pyongyang?

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:24.400
She says Pyongyang

01:33:24.733 --> 01:33:26.007
Pyongyang?

01:33:26.635 --> 01:33:29.275
War will break out

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:31.747
- I know
- Pardon?

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:35.043
Nothing will happen
if I blow it up in South Korea

01:33:36.745 --> 01:33:38.746
<i>It's not aimed at Busan
It's for Pyongyang</i>

01:33:38.747 --> 01:33:40.522
Get all Pyongyang citizens evacuated

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:44.256
Who the hell is this guy?

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.799
His real name is Kim Min-cheol

01:33:46.888 --> 01:33:49.528
A former North Korean operative
working in the US

01:33:49.891 --> 01:33:51.336
His mother is Russian

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:54.407
In the early 2000s,
the CIA was after him

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:56.631
He asked North Korea for help
but they turned a blind eye

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:58.399
Afterwards, he sought political asylum
in South Korea

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.505
but the request was also rejected

01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:03.204
Later, he went over to Europe
and became a mercenary for AJ

01:34:03.205 --> 01:34:05.973
but it appears he is actually
connected to General Martin

01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:08.682
the world's biggest
military arms developer

01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:10.112
Who is he then?

01:34:10.178 --> 01:34:11.714
A double agent

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:16.322
A.J's objective is to create the fear of war
on the Korean peninsula

01:34:16.585 --> 01:34:19.327
but General Martin
has different agenda

01:34:20.122 --> 01:34:21.760
They want a full-blown war in Korea

01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:25.900
How is Baek relevant in all this?

01:34:26.028 --> 01:34:28.440
She is an authoritative scientist
in the field of AVLIS

01:34:28.630 --> 01:34:32.333
The first thing you need
to build nuke is uranium 239

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:35.636
Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation System
known as AVLIS

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:38.914
is what you need to extract 239

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:40.680
Say that again in plain Korean?

01:34:40.742 --> 01:34:42.977
You can make nuke
if you have Baek

01:34:42.978 --> 01:34:44.855
She is worth hundreds of billions

01:34:46.615 --> 01:34:48.856
Of course,
General Martin is interested

01:34:50.252 --> 01:34:51.629
Can I ask you

01:34:51.887 --> 01:34:54.094
why are you doing this?

01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:57.198
You don' t look like the type

01:34:57.325 --> 01:34:58.895
Ask your husband

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:00.198
Pardon?

01:35:01.263 --> 01:35:03.004
Because he is a spy, too

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:05.933
Spy?

01:35:05.934 --> 01:35:10.041
You've got something
terribly wrong

01:35:10.105 --> 01:35:13.746
My husband is just
an ordinary office worker

01:35:14.009 --> 01:35:18.116
If one of us were a spy,
then it's more likely to be me

01:35:20.982 --> 01:35:26.694
North Korea has already
denied your existence!

01:35:26.955 --> 01:35:30.596
South Korea rejected your asylum!

01:35:30.826 --> 01:35:34.205
Neither one of them
gives a shit about you!

01:35:55.484 --> 01:35:56.554
How did it go?

01:35:56.651 --> 01:35:58.858
This way, please

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:00.892
Our men are already on the case

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:05.030
- It's white
- Pardon?

01:36:05.694 --> 01:36:06.934
A nuclear warhead

01:36:07.896 --> 01:36:08.704
Nu...nuke?

01:36:09.064 --> 01:36:10.264
Code red! Code red!

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:11.432
Ryan has a nuclear warhead

01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:12.066
<i>I repeat</i>

01:36:12.067 --> 01:36:14.172
<i>- Ryan has nuclear warhead
- A what'?</i>

01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:16.406
Get Tile-roofed House on the line

01:36:16.671 --> 01:36:19.515
Call military headquarters
Have all forces dispatched to lncheon

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.025
Don't worry
Nothing will happen

01:36:36.658 --> 01:36:37.728
Let's go

01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:41.201
Don't rush
Wait for a cue

01:36:51.506 --> 01:36:53.486
This is building A,
where the warhead is kept

01:36:53.775 --> 01:36:55.550
The hostage trade will
take place in building B

01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.848
Sales ll will proceed to A
and secure the White

01:36:57.946 --> 01:37:00.893
Team I will rescue Baek

01:37:01.917 --> 01:37:04.056
We've got 10 minutes
Connect!

01:37:04.186 --> 01:37:05.096
Connect!

01:37:33.114 --> 01:37:34.923
One at the rooftop entrance
One by the tower

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:37.223
Team ll, stand by

01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:43.228
Enemy detected on rooftop

01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:48.330
Eliminate target

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:52.303
<i>Eliminated
We'll proceed rooftop</i>

01:37:56.605 --> 01:37:58.038
<i>Complex B rooftop secure</i>

01:37:58.039 --> 01:38:00.280
<i>Entering the target area</i>

01:38:03.645 --> 01:38:04.487
Enemy elimination confirmed

01:38:04.579 --> 01:38:05.751
Good job
Get into positions

01:38:07.115 --> 01:38:08.526
Hostage on sight

01:38:09.284 --> 01:38:10.422
Cuckoo enters

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.234
Team ll proceed toward the warhead

01:38:29.004 --> 01:38:29.880
Oh dear

01:38:30.005 --> 01:38:31.211
I'm sorry

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.310
Let's go

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:36.320
Is that a gun? Jeez!

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:39.314
Honey!

01:38:39.681 --> 01:38:40.814
Stay down

01:38:40.815 --> 01:38:43.921
Where did you get that?
Drop it

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:45.430
Turn yourself in

01:38:46.821 --> 01:38:48.129
Alright, alright

01:38:48.223 --> 01:38:49.725
Release your hostage first

01:38:49.824 --> 01:38:51.132
You first

01:38:52.127 --> 01:38:53.504
We'll do a simultaneous exchange

01:38:58.333 --> 01:39:02.110
Aw! That hurts

01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:09.718
Stay calm

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:15.454
Bye bye

01:39:37.105 --> 01:39:38.140
Team ll, proceed

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:45.617
Counting down, 5

01:39:46.214 --> 01:39:49.717
5,4, 3, 2

01:39:50.585 --> 01:39:51.586
Launch grenade

01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:09.903
Hey! I know you

01:40:09.904 --> 01:40:11.042
Hurry!

01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:19.713
My husband came

01:40:19.714 --> 01:40:21.990
- He's here. My husband's here
- Come on

01:41:01.856 --> 01:41:04.029
Baby

01:41:04.259 --> 01:41:06.239
Honey!

01:41:06.361 --> 01:41:07.396
Shh!

01:41:07.495 --> 01:41:09.304
You alright, baby?

01:41:13.368 --> 01:41:14.346
Don't you worry about anything

01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:17.006
This is all part of an operation

01:41:17.505 --> 01:41:21.009
We've got people from NIS, too

01:41:21.676 --> 01:41:22.950
Nice to meet you

01:41:24.279 --> 01:41:25.815
Pleasure...

01:41:26.514 --> 01:41:28.050
Who is this woman?

01:41:29.684 --> 01:41:31.186
I'll tell you later

01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:34.633
You know her?

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:41.166
<i>Covering on third ﬂoor
Proceed to level 3 now</i>

01:41:43.465 --> 01:41:45.138
Stay right behind me, okay?

01:41:49.104 --> 01:41:50.447
<i>Hurry, please</i>

01:42:15.196 --> 01:42:17.267
What are you doing? Hurry up

01:42:22.737 --> 01:42:23.875
Time?

01:42:24.172 --> 01:42:25.082
10 minutes

01:42:25.173 --> 01:42:26.345
Go. Go

01:42:37.452 --> 01:42:38.590
HEY

01:42:39.554 --> 01:42:42.865
You've got nothing to be afraid of

01:42:43.391 --> 01:42:46.270
This place is surrounded by
NIS agents all over

01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:49.007
Stay close to me

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:50.268
Okay?

01:42:51.866 --> 01:42:52.933
Okay

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:54.777
Stay focused!

01:42:57.338 --> 01:42:59.045
I'll kick their asses

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:05.582
Duck

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:19.394
Get down

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:24.599
What a crazy bitch

01:43:28.136 --> 01:43:29.403
<i>There is no disarming device</i>

01:43:29.404 --> 01:43:30.470
It's active

01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:32.039
but I can't tell
when it will be launched

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.576
There'll be a missile control box

01:43:33.675 --> 01:43:34.949
Alright

01:43:40.782 --> 01:43:42.693
I'll cover you
Go over there

01:43:48.022 --> 01:43:49.126
Chul-soo!

01:44:01.536 --> 01:44:02.571
Oh my god

01:44:05.607 --> 01:44:08.053
Who are you?

01:44:08.176 --> 01:44:09.348
Tell me

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:12.653
Are you really a spy?
Oh gosh

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:13.782
Later!

01:44:16.818 --> 01:44:18.593
What's going on in here?

01:44:19.254 --> 01:44:20.426
Cover me

01:44:30.064 --> 01:44:31.372
Where are you going?

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:39.878
Go

01:44:42.944 --> 01:44:44.787
My God... Kim

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.258
Is he really a SPY?

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:53.998
Comrade Kim is carrying out
an important mission for the country

01:44:54.355 --> 01:44:57.393
My husband?

01:45:01.296 --> 01:45:03.833
And who the hell are you?

01:45:45.039 --> 01:45:46.109
Yeong-hui!

01:45:48.343 --> 01:45:49.344
Yeong-hui!

01:46:12.066 --> 01:46:13.443
Get in
Go, go

01:46:17.505 --> 01:46:19.007
Honey

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:28.526
Fly

01:46:39.594 --> 01:46:41.596
Hey! Chul-soo!

01:46:49.036 --> 01:46:50.447
<i>- What about Baek?
- Sir?</i>

01:46:51.072 --> 01:46:52.881
Is she safe?

01:46:53.674 --> 01:46:55.449
Of course

01:47:08.723 --> 01:47:11.203
We are going to the position
Do you copy?

01:47:11.793 --> 01:47:13.295
Roger that
Your way

01:47:13.628 --> 01:47:14.766
See you there

01:47:18.232 --> 01:47:19.575
What do you want?

01:47:35.183 --> 01:47:36.787
You crazy bitch!

01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:47.729
Hey!

01:47:47.929 --> 01:47:48.930
Damn it!

01:48:01.943 --> 01:48:03.251
Don't shoot
