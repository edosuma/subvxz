<i>engine rumbling</i> )

10:55.654 --> 10:57.907

RAYMUNDO, YOU RULE.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.311

11:28.479 --> 11:30.606

LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

11:30.689 --> 11:34.151

12:16.652 --> 12:19.405

THANK YOU!

12:19.488 --> 12:23.659
PATTY, YOUR SHOELACE
IS UNTIED.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.000
WHAT TOOK YOU?

12:31.083 --> 12:31.834
TRAFFIC WAS CRAZY.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.796
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA DO THIS,
ROCKETBOY?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.423
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN MISS.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.301
{\an5}TWISTER,
RUN THROUGH IT
ONE MORE TIME.

12:41.677 --> 12:45.181
START OUT HERE
WITH A MAJOR AIR OLLIE

12:45.264 --> 12:48.225
THEN PICK UP SPEED
AND NAIL THE 360 MUSKRAT

12:48.309 --> 12:51.437
IN FRONT OF THE WRINKLE WAGON
AS IT TURNS ONTO THE PIER.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.440
GENERATIONS TO COME
WILL CALL IT

12:54.523 --> 12:55.691
THE OTTO ROCKET
LOOP-DEE-LOOP.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.236
I'M NAUSEOUS
JUST DOING THE CALCULATIONS.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.990

13:06.911 --> 13:08.829
I HEAR DESTINY CALLING.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.134
THE MERVINATOR BEEFS IT.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.303
VERY, VERY BAD.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.471
(<i> groaning</i> )

14:07.555 --> 14:09.431
MERV, MERV,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!

14:09.515 --> 14:11.809
(<i> groans louder</i> )

14:11.892 --> 14:13.727
{\an1}OH, MAN,
ARE WE IN TROUBLE.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.229
WHAT DO YOU MEAN <i> WE?</i>

14:15.312 --> 14:17.940
<i>WE</i> HAVE ONLY BEEN
TOLD A MILLION TIMES

14:18.023 --> 14:19.233
NOT TO SKATE
ON THE BOARDWALK.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.652
DOES THIS HURT?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.947
(<i> moaning loudly</i> )

14:25.030 --> 14:25.322
ARE YOU SURE?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.449
HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.660
(<i> screaming</i> )

14:36.250 --> 14:37.459
Otto:
OH, MAN...

14:37.543 --> 14:40.337
STIMPLETON'S
IN A SLING.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.382
{\an5}LOOKS LIKE
HE'S IN PAIN.
WE'RE TOAST.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.259
{\an1}REGGIE, GO SEE
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.636
Reggie:
I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.096
BAN SKATEBOARDING.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.141
TWISTER? WHY DON'T YOU GO
SEE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING?

14:52.224 --> 14:56.520
ME! OH...

14:56.604 --> 14:58.814
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

14:58.897 --> 14:59.982
IT'S JUST A SPRAIN.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.484
NOW, VIOLET,
LIKE THE DOCTOR SAID

15:02.568 --> 15:05.904
I DO HAVE MINOR DISCOMFORT
IN THE ELBOW REGION.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.655
WHAT'S NEXT? OTHER REGIONS?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.241
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.161
THAT'S WHY THE "OCEAN SHORES
WE CARE COMMITTEE"--

15:12.244 --> 15:13.454
OR O.S.W.C.C.--
IS HERE.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.663
THE "WE CARE COMMITTEE?"

15:14.747 --> 15:17.833
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO?

15:17.916 --> 15:19.418
WE CARE, VIOLET.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.170
WE CAN'T HELP IT.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.338
WE JUST DO.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.882
AND SO MERVIN STIMPLETON

15:24.965 --> 15:28.177
{\an1}AS PRESIDENT OF THE OCEAN SHORES
WE CARE COMMITTEE

15:28.260 --> 15:32.681
{\an4}I WOULD LIKE TO DRAFT YOU
AS OUR SYMBOL OF THE WAY
OCEAN SHORES USED TO BE

15:32.765 --> 15:34.516
{\an1}AND TAKE A STAND
AGAINST THE MISGUIDED

15:34.600 --> 15:38.145
SKATE-OBSESSED YOUTH CULTURE.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.480
YOU MEAN HOOLIGANS!

15:39.563 --> 15:42.066
(<i> laughs</i> ) WELL PUT.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.277
{\an1}OH, MERV, CAN'T WE JUST
FORGET ALL THIS FOOLISHNESS?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.030
{\an1}OH, I WISH I COULD, VIOLET,
BUT DESTINY CALLS

15:48.113 --> 15:52.743
AND MERVIN J. STIMPLETON
MUST ANSWER.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.245
THIS MERVIN THING IS KILLING ME.
(<i> laughs</i> )

15:55.329 --> 15:57.873
{\an3}SHH.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.209
{\an1}TOMORROW AT THE EMERGENCY
CITY HALL MEETING

16:00.292 --> 16:03.170
WITH YOUR BLESSING,
WE WILL CALL FOR A BAN

16:03.253 --> 16:07.800
{\an5}ON SKATING, BLADING, BIKING,
LAUGHING, RUNNING, HORSEPLAY,
ROUGHHOUSING

16:07.883 --> 16:11.887
AND THAT SCOURGE
OF ALL PEDESTRIANS--

16:11.970 --> 16:13.013
SKATEBOARDING.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.143
Twister:
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.896
I PRACTICALLY LIVE ON WHEELS.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.564
ME, TOO, BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.317
WE CAN STAGE A PROTEST.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.403
WE CAN GET ALL THE KIDS WE KNOW

16:27.486 --> 16:28.987
TO GO TO CITY HALL
AND FIGHT THE BAN.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.908
{\an5}WE CAN MAKE
A HUMAN CHAIN AROUND
STIMPLETON'S HOUSE

16:32.991 --> 16:35.703
UNTIL HE DITCHES
THOSE "WE CARE" KOOKS.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.497
WHY DON'T WE JUST MOVE HIS HOUSE
TO ANOTHER TOWN?

16:38.580 --> 16:39.915
IF WE HAVE TO.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.834
HE'S KIDDING,
BRAINIAC.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.211
WE NEED TO ATTACK
FROM ALL SIDES

16:44.294 --> 16:46.213
BUT STILL PLAY
BY THE RULES.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.924
{\an5}HEY, HOW ARE OUR
JUVENILE DELINQUENTS
DOING?

16:49.007 --> 16:50.467
YOU KIDS APOLOGIZE YET?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.386
NO.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.679
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO?"

16:53.762 --> 16:57.266
{\an1}DAD, IT WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.017
{\an1}THEY'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE

16:59.101 --> 17:01.770
{\an1}TO BAN SKATING FROM
THE BOARDWALK AND THE PIER.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.272
ALL THAT ASIDE...

17:03.355 --> 17:07.608
YOU STILL KNOCKED MERV DOWN
AND YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.694
ARE WE CLEAR?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.694
OKAY, DAD.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.654
{\an3}YES,
SIR.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.114
CRYSTAL, RAYMUNDO.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.117
AND DON'T FORGET TO
SMILE A BIG WIDE SMILE

17:15.200 --> 17:18.119
{\an5}WHEN YOU SAY,
"SORRY I BROKE YOUR
ELBOW, MR. STIMP."

17:24.585 --> 17:26.211
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

17:29.006 --> 17:29.798
HELLO,

17:29.882 --> 17:34.094
CAN WE SPEAK WITH
MR. STIMPLETON, PLEASE?

17:34.178 --> 17:37.765
OH... IT'S YOU.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.434
UH, HI,

17:40.517 --> 17:43.312
{\an5}UH, OTTO

TO TELL YOU.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.063
I'M LISTENING.

17:45.147 --> 17:50.152
{\an1}I'M SORRY I MADE YOU SLIP
ON THE SKATEBOARD.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.945

17:52.029 --> 17:55.407

EXCUSE MERV.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.797
THE INJURY MAKE HIM
A LITTLE CRANKY.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.714
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

18:10.798 --> 18:15.302
GOOD... BYE,
MRS. STIMPLETON.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.182

19:30.127 --> 19:31.211
CHEER UP, GUYS.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.921
LIKE THE ANCIENTS SAID

19:33.005 --> 19:35.007
"THE COCONUT,
THOUGH HARD AND ROUND

"IN THE SPRING GIVES MILK

AFTER BEING KISSED
BY THE GREEN WATER."

19:43.891 --> 19:47.436
{\an1}I KNOW--
IT COMFORTS ME, TOO.

EVENTUALLY.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.168
HOW'S HIS ARM?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.045
WELL ENOUGH TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS

20:13.128 --> 20:15.047
AND SHAKE HANDS WITH REPORTERS.

20:15.130 --> 20:15.756
HE'S NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.467
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO BORED.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.468
BORED?

20:19.551 --> 20:19.885
{\an3}WHAT?

20:19.968 --> 20:21.803
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.055
THE BAN HAS TURNED

20:23.138 --> 20:24.598
THIS WHOLE BURG
INTO A GHOST TOWN.

20:24.681 --> 20:30.479
{\an5}TOO BAD THERE'S NO PLACE
FOR YOU KIDS TO SKATE
THAT'S SAFE AND FRIENDLY.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.855
OH, WELL, GOT TO GO.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.359
{\an1}NEED TO KEEP MY BLOOD PRESSURE

20:35.442 --> 20:38.445
THE KIDS NEED A PLACE TO GO...

20:38.528 --> 20:40.656
WE COULD FIX UP OUR HALF PIKE!

20:40.739 --> 20:42.199
WE COULD CHARGE ADMISSION.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.325
CAN I GET IN FOR FREE?

21:02.260 --> 21:02.928
OH, MERV STIMPLEFINK?

21:03.011 --> 21:05.681
{\an1}CALL ME

21:38.213 --> 21:40.298
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING, VIOLET?

21:40.382 --> 21:42.467
THE KIDS NEED A PLACE
THEY CAN SKATE

21:42.551 --> 21:43.260
THAT'S SAFE AND FRIENDLY.

21:43.343 --> 21:47.514
{\an1}A PLACE THAT'S FAR AWAY
FROM MY HOUSE!

21:47.597 --> 21:51.309

...a place designed
for the safety

OF OUR CHILDREN
AND THE COMMUNITY.

21:53.270 --> 21:57.482
AND SO, ON BEHALF
OF THE WE CARE COMMITTEE
