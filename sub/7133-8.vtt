50:55.000 --> 50:57.066
Go! Go, go, go there.
Go, go!

50:59.166 --> 51:00.200
Go!

51:02.533 --> 51:04.333
[inmates yelling]

51:22.567 --> 51:25.767
- Where the fucking tits?
[overlapping shouting]

51:25.834 --> 51:28.700
Where the fucking tits?!
Where the tits?

51:28.767 --> 51:30.000
- Tits?

51:30.066 --> 51:31.633
[Adebisi continues
yelling]

51:31.700 --> 51:33.100
- Where the fucking tits?

51:33.166 --> 51:36.100
- [groaning]
- Aah! Aah!

51:36.166 --> 51:37.867
Where are the tits?

51:37.934 --> 51:39.967
- Adebisi!!

51:42.000 --> 51:43.667
[inmates quiet down]

51:43.734 --> 51:46.934
- [choking] Ack--
- [panting]

51:47.000 --> 51:49.300
- It's finished!

51:49.367 --> 51:51.834
It's over!

51:51.900 --> 51:54.667
- [gasping, wheezing]

51:59.533 --> 52:01.266
- [laughing]

52:01.333 --> 52:02.667
Whoo-ha!

52:04.300 --> 52:06.934
Wah-ha-ha-ha!

52:07.000 --> 52:08.767
- Police, police!

52:13.533 --> 52:15.533
- It's execution day, baby.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.700
[metallic clang]

52:19.767 --> 52:23.867
Prisoner number 93A234,
Simon Adebisi.

52:23.934 --> 52:26.433
Convicted May 2, '93,

52:26.500 --> 52:28.667
murder in the first degree.

52:28.734 --> 52:33.033
Sentence: life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

52:36.767 --> 52:38.300
Go ahead...

52:39.133 --> 52:41.100
Kill me.
[panting]

52:44.867 --> 52:46.800
- I don't wanna kill you.

52:46.867 --> 52:49.700
- I know.
You wanna save my ass.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.500
- Yes, I wanna save you.

52:51.567 --> 52:53.033
- Please...

52:53.100 --> 52:55.667
Give me some tits.

52:55.734 --> 52:58.033
Give me some
tits!

53:00.934 --> 53:03.800
Give me some
fucking tits!

53:04.033 --> 53:07.800
- They say it don't matter
if you win or lose,

53:07.867 --> 53:09.567
it's how you play the game.

53:09.633 --> 53:12.433
I call bullshit on that.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.834
It's all about winning,
brother.

53:13.900 --> 53:16.033
That's the object
of the game.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.233
- What is that?

53:18.300 --> 53:20.000
- Beginning and the end,
my brother,

53:20.066 --> 53:21.200
the beginning and the end.

53:21.266 --> 53:22.934
Okay, everybody!

53:23.000 --> 53:25.633
They're about to
make their move!

53:25.700 --> 53:27.367
Bring out the hostages!

53:27.433 --> 53:29.533
- Please, untie me.

53:29.600 --> 53:31.800
- You shouldn't have stolen
my fucking watch!

53:31.867 --> 53:34.033
- Untie me.
Don't be like that.

53:34.100 --> 53:37.133
Untie me!
- Stand in a straight line.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.667
When they come in,
you get hit first.

53:44.934 --> 53:48.934
Any last words?
- Suck my dick.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.667
- If only
there were time.

53:59.033 --> 54:00.567
- [muffled]
Get down!

54:00.633 --> 54:01.667
- Said....

54:05.000 --> 54:07.100
- Fuck! Open the
fucking door, man!

54:09.333 --> 54:10.533
- [coughing]

54:10.600 --> 54:11.900
- Fuck!

54:11.967 --> 54:13.200
- Aaaaaahhhhh!

54:13.266 --> 54:16.066
Oh, yeah, motherfuckers!

54:16.133 --> 54:17.767
[men coughing]

54:21.400 --> 54:23.633
[gunfire]

54:23.700 --> 54:25.000
[men coughing]

54:25.066 --> 54:27.233
[gunfire]

54:28.734 --> 54:30.266
[glass shatters]

54:30.333 --> 54:31.967
[gunshot]

54:32.934 --> 54:34.633
[glass shatters]

54:34.700 --> 54:37.600
[tense music]

54:37.667 --> 54:41.100
[crashing, clattering]

54:45.300 --> 54:47.133
[indistinct background
chatter]

54:47.200 --> 54:49.767
[gunshot]

54:51.767 --> 54:56.200
- Yeah, who cares who lives
or dies in prison?

54:56.266 --> 54:58.066
We read the names
in the morning paper,

54:58.133 --> 54:59.667
and they mean nothing to us.

54:59.734 --> 55:01.834
They're faceless.

55:01.900 --> 55:04.233
The truth is we don't wanna
put a face on them.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.834
We don't wanna know
who they really  are,

55:06.900 --> 55:10.033
because then it might hit
too close to home,

55:10.100 --> 55:12.934
and home is what
it's all about, right?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.867
Making a home
no matter where you are,

55:14.934 --> 55:16.800
no matter who  you are.

55:16.867 --> 55:18.200
At the end of the day,

55:18.266 --> 55:20.633
everybody
wants somewhere to rest,

55:20.700 --> 55:22.400
somewhere to lay their bones,

55:22.467 --> 55:26.233
even if
it's in a land called Oz.

55:26.300 --> 55:29.367
Yeah, like Dorothy says

55:29.433 --> 55:32.900
when she wakes up in her own bed
back at Aunt Em's,

55:32.967 --> 55:35.400
"There's no place like home."

55:35.467 --> 55:38.734
There's no fucking place
like home.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.100
[laughs]
