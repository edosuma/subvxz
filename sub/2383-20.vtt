00:00.702 --> 00:01.936
<i>Kids, as you know,</i>

00:01.938 --> 00:03.371
<i>I was designing</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank's</i>

00:03.373 --> 00:06.174
<i>new headquarters on the site of</i>
<i>this old hotel, The Arcadian.</i>

00:07.410 --> 00:08.993
<i>Problem was,</i>
<i>some people didn't want</i>

00:08.995 --> 00:10.578
<i>The Arcadian torn down.</i>

00:10.580 --> 00:14.465
<i>Even bigger problem, they were</i>
<i>led by my girlfriend Zoey.</i>

00:14.467 --> 00:15.633
G-N-B is
the e-ne-my!

00:15.635 --> 00:17.618
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on!
Hey, sweetie!

00:17.620 --> 00:20.421
Are we still on for dinner
at 8:00 at Valenzisi's?

00:21.623 --> 00:24.425
That's great! I can't wait!

00:24.427 --> 00:26.794
That's great. I can't wait!
That's great. I can't wait!

00:26.796 --> 00:30.231
<i>But somehow, Zoey and I were</i>
<i>making it work.</i>

00:30.233 --> 00:33.367
Ted, why are you dating
our arch-enemy?!

00:33.369 --> 00:35.236
I mean, Wile E.
Coyote wasn't trying

00:35.238 --> 00:36.404
to sleep with the Roadrunner.

00:36.406 --> 00:38.005
Or maybe he was.

00:38.007 --> 00:39.273
Think about it.

00:39.275 --> 00:41.409
The way that she bats
her eyelashes

00:41.411 --> 00:44.879
and shakes her
tail feathers in his face?

00:44.881 --> 00:46.214
She wants it.

00:47.249 --> 00:49.484
Isn't it hard for you guys
to be on opposite sides

00:49.486 --> 00:50.485
of something like this?

00:50.487 --> 00:52.286
Of course you feel that way,
Lily.

00:52.288 --> 00:54.021
You and Marshall
have basically melded

00:54.023 --> 00:56.357
into one big
hermaphroditic blob.

00:56.359 --> 00:58.092
And that's fine for you guys.

00:58.094 --> 00:59.260
But some of us want

00:59.262 --> 01:01.796
a partner who challenges us
to grow and evolve.

01:01.798 --> 01:04.565
You guys are in screaming
matches all the time.

01:04.566 --> 01:05.800
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:05.802 --> 01:07.368
<i>Growing</i> matches.

01:07.370 --> 01:08.769
<i>It was true.</i>

01:08.771 --> 01:11.072
<i>Zoey and I loved</i>
<i>to challenge each other.</i>

01:11.074 --> 01:13.608
The main character
is a young spoiled prince

01:13.610 --> 01:16.110
thrust into leadership
after the death of his father.

01:16.112 --> 01:18.279
It's obviously a modern-day
retelling of <i>Henry IV!</i>

01:18.281 --> 01:20.181
Are you kidding me?!

01:20.183 --> 01:22.483
It's <i>Don Quixote...</i>
the classic quest story

01:22.485 --> 01:25.353
with the hero-jester and his
long-suffering manservant!

01:25.355 --> 01:28.089
Okay, clearly,
when we're watching <i>Tommy Boy,</i>

01:28.091 --> 01:31.358
we're watching
two different movies.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.960
No, you hang up.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.695
No, you hang up.

01:34.697 --> 01:36.864
No, you hang up.

01:36.866 --> 01:38.332
No, you hang up.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.835
No, you hang up!

01:40.837 --> 01:43.170
No, you hang up.

01:43.172 --> 01:44.372
No, you hang up.

01:44.374 --> 01:45.806
No, you...

01:45.808 --> 01:48.042
Hold on.

01:48.044 --> 01:49.744
Hello?

01:49.746 --> 01:53.314
For the love of God, will one
of you idiots hang up the phone?

01:56.519 --> 01:58.686
Why would you do that?!

01:58.688 --> 02:00.888
I-I thought you'd like it.

02:00.890 --> 02:02.623
Who likes that?

02:02.625 --> 02:04.692
I like it.

02:06.445 --> 02:09.196
Your relationship
sounds exhausting.

02:09.198 --> 02:11.365
Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.702
Marshall and I have been
together 15 years,

02:14.704 --> 02:17.238
and the only debate
we've had about <i>Tommy Boy</i>

02:17.240 --> 02:20.041
is whether it's awesome
or super awesome.

02:20.043 --> 02:22.243
That's love, bitch.

I have to quit.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.578
Quit GNB?! Why?

02:57.580 --> 03:00.848
I need to do better
things with my life, okay?

03:00.850 --> 03:02.850
There's-There's an opening
for an environmental lawyer

03:02.852 --> 03:04.752
at the National Resources
Defense Council.

03:04.754 --> 03:06.287
Sure, it pays less, but

03:06.289 --> 03:09.790
I'd be saving the oceans,
saving endangered species...

03:09.792 --> 03:13.494
Saving chicken bones and
an old boot to make hobo soup?

03:13.496 --> 03:14.862
Marshall, you can't

03:14.864 --> 03:18.399
pay your mortgage
with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.

03:18.401 --> 03:20.701
Baby, you have my full support.

Well, then, you're not going
to be able to pay

03:22.672 --> 03:24.472
for that trip to Spain
that you've been planning.

03:25.608 --> 03:26.857
Say good-bye

03:26.859 --> 03:28.409
to riding around in gondolas,

03:28.411 --> 03:32.980
and eating bratwurst
and seeing the pyramids.

03:32.982 --> 03:35.383
I don't think you know
what Spain is.

03:35.385 --> 03:39.654
Well, I know that a trip there
costs some serious lira.

03:39.656 --> 03:40.421
It's <i>dinero.</i>

03:40.423 --> 03:42.923
Where? I want his autograph!

03:42.925 --> 03:45.960
<i>So Marshall walked in the
next morning all ready to quit.</i>

04:08.370 --> 04:09.736
It's graduation goggles.
What?

04:09.738 --> 04:11.905
Graduation goggles,
like with high school.

04:11.907 --> 04:12.972
It's four years of bullies

04:12.974 --> 04:14.941
making fun of all the kids
with braces,

04:14.943 --> 04:17.877
even after the braces come off
and they can walk just fine.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.144
But then, on graduation day,

04:19.147 --> 04:21.014
you suddenly get all misty
because you realize

04:21.016 --> 04:22.816
you're never going
to see those jerks again.

04:22.818 --> 04:26.252
I just had graduation goggles
with that guy Scooby I dated.

04:26.254 --> 04:28.421
The guy who
was basically a dog?

04:28.423 --> 04:31.291
He was the worst kisser
I've ever been with.

No! You can't

is coming back

05:23.645 --> 05:24.944
to give another sexual
harassment seminar,

05:24.946 --> 05:26.713
and I bribed one
of the maintenance guys

05:26.715 --> 05:28.681
to keep the room
at a brisk 55 degrees!

05:28.683 --> 05:33.119
Baby, more than ever,
you have my full support.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.590
You know, sometimes I feel
bad for Lily and Marshall.

05:37.592 --> 05:39.959
I'm starting to feel bad
for Ted and Zoey.

05:41.528 --> 05:44.797
It starts with an... "L?"

05:44.799 --> 05:47.200
How can you not
remember my name?

05:47.202 --> 05:48.701
It's like they never
challenge each other.

05:48.703 --> 05:51.337
They just automatically
agree all the time.

05:51.339 --> 05:53.673
Well, they don't do that all the time.
Yes, they do.

05:53.675 --> 05:55.408
No, they don't. Yes, they do.

05:55.410 --> 05:56.576
It's like they...

05:56.578 --> 05:58.678
...don't see eye-to-eye on anything!

05:58.680 --> 06:01.481
Totally.
Totally.

06:01.483 --> 06:03.549
It rhymes with your name.

06:05.152 --> 06:08.621
And I said my name was...?

06:09.523 --> 06:12.108
Baby, I did it! I quit.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.862
And then I walked right over to
the NRDC, and I took that job.

06:15.864 --> 06:18.064
Oh, good for you, sweetie.
Yeah.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.816
It's a little less money
than I was expecting.

06:19.818 --> 06:22.235
I mean, compared to what I was
making at GNB, it's nothing.

06:22.237 --> 06:24.370
Actually compared to
anything, it's nothing.

06:24.372 --> 06:26.139
It's nothing.

06:26.141 --> 06:27.907
The paid position
just got filled,

06:27.909 --> 06:30.543
so all I can do is-is
volunteer right now.

06:30.545 --> 06:32.778
You're cool with that, right?

06:32.780 --> 06:35.882
Baby, if this is what you need
to do, we'll figure it out.

06:35.884 --> 06:38.584
How's Barney handling
you leaving?

06:42.756 --> 06:46.125
Hey, Barney, there's a bunch
of models in the lobby,

06:46.127 --> 06:48.328
and the gossip is
one of them is really a dude.

06:48.330 --> 06:50.096
You want to play
"Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"

06:50.098 --> 06:53.232
It's always the one
in the turtleneck, Ted.

06:53.234 --> 06:55.268
And no, I don't want to play.

06:55.270 --> 06:58.104
Stupid Marshall...
ruined everything.

06:58.106 --> 07:00.657
Oh, come on.
Everything's not ruined.

07:00.659 --> 07:01.708
Guys, everything's ruined.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.359
What? Why?

07:03.361 --> 07:05.445
Your girlfriend somehow got the
Landmark Preservation Committee

07:05.447 --> 07:06.713
to agree to a hearing.

07:06.715 --> 07:08.481
If they declare
the Arcadian a landmark,

07:08.483 --> 07:09.983
the whole project is dead.

07:11.819 --> 07:13.920
The good news is,
I just got the phone number

07:13.922 --> 07:15.421
of a husky-voiced hottie
in a turtleneck.

07:21.019 --> 07:22.920
...so, if the Landmarks
Preservation Committee

07:22.922 --> 07:25.823
sides with Zoey, your whole
project goes down the tubes?

07:26.915 --> 07:28.448
You must be furious.

07:28.450 --> 07:32.452
I'm furiously enjoying
being challenged.

07:32.454 --> 07:33.920
Why don't you admit that

07:33.922 --> 07:35.822
your girlfriend challenging
your every move

07:35.824 --> 07:38.425
is getting you
a little murder-suicidey?

07:38.427 --> 07:40.493
Why don't you admit that
Marshall quitting his job

07:40.495 --> 07:42.495
and taking an unpaid
internship is killing you?

07:42.497 --> 07:43.363
It's not.

07:43.365 --> 07:44.764
Lily, the downside

07:44.766 --> 07:46.633
to having giant,
Japanese anime eyes is

07:46.635 --> 07:47.967
that they're easy to read.

07:47.969 --> 07:49.269
And yours are screaming,

07:49.271 --> 07:51.704
"What about my trip
to Spain, deadbeat?"

07:51.706 --> 07:54.774
Okay, Ted, the downside
to having a woman's mouth is,

07:54.776 --> 07:57.510
your feminine pout gives away
your true feelings.

07:57.512 --> 07:59.112
And yours is saying,

07:59.114 --> 08:02.849
"Oh, Zoey, why can't I be
on top just this once?"

08:02.851 --> 08:04.417
We take turns!

08:04.419 --> 08:06.102
Sometimes.

08:06.104 --> 08:08.138
Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.657
I just had the best first day
at the NRDC.

08:14.696 --> 08:16.596
I'm sorry. Sorry.

08:16.598 --> 08:19.282
Something Hershel said
at work today.

08:20.602 --> 08:22.168
Hershel?

08:22.170 --> 08:24.437
What, don't you guys know
Hershel? Didn't I tell you?

08:24.439 --> 08:26.673
Oh, he's the new lawyer
who replaced Marshall at GNB.

08:26.675 --> 08:27.774
He is so

08:27.776 --> 08:29.843
awesome and funny

08:29.845 --> 08:31.578
and tall... taller
than Marshall...

08:31.580 --> 08:32.511
and he knows

08:32.514 --> 08:34.114
way more laws.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.948
Well, I'm glad
you like your new co-worker.

08:35.951 --> 08:37.350
There's no Hershel!

08:37.352 --> 08:39.018
I was just saying that
to make you jealous!

08:39.020 --> 08:40.437
Why do you insist
we play these games?

08:40.438 --> 08:43.188
Barney, I'm not playing...
Just come back to GNB already!

08:43.191 --> 08:44.424
I'm really loving my new job.

08:44.426 --> 08:47.360
Oh, and I'm loving
seeing you this happy.

08:47.362 --> 08:49.095
I'm so glad to hear you say that

08:49.097 --> 08:50.280
because I volunteered
our apartment

08:50.282 --> 08:51.965
for a big NRDC fund-raiser
tomorrow night.

08:51.967 --> 08:53.133
You're-You're cool
with that, right?

08:53.135 --> 08:54.567
Baby, you have my full support.

08:54.569 --> 08:56.236
Thanks, baby.

08:56.238 --> 08:57.837
Oh.

08:57.839 --> 08:59.305
Ooh, I gotta go.

08:59.307 --> 09:00.273
The invitations are ready.

09:00.275 --> 09:01.241
The party's for a bunch

09:01.243 --> 09:02.408
of environmentalists,

09:02.410 --> 09:03.943
so I found a guy downtown

09:03.945 --> 09:05.245
who makes biodegradable
party invitations

09:05.247 --> 09:08.214
that can also be used
as toilet paper.

09:08.216 --> 09:10.183
That's how I'm gonna use mine.

09:10.185 --> 09:12.469
Why in the world
do you care so much

09:12.471 --> 09:14.254
whether Marshall works at GNB?

09:14.256 --> 09:15.755
Care? I don't care.

09:15.757 --> 09:17.524
I'm like, whatever.
Marshall who?

09:17.526 --> 09:20.160
He's stupid.
Hershel's way better.

09:20.162 --> 09:22.095
Okay, Barney, is
it possible that

09:22.097 --> 09:24.297
with everything that's gone
on with your dad lately,

09:24.299 --> 09:26.299
you might have some
unresolved abandonment issues

09:26.301 --> 09:27.934
you're transferring
onto Marshall?

09:27.936 --> 09:29.102
Oh! Ugh!

09:29.104 --> 09:30.636
You are worse than my shrink.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.506
"Barney, we have
to talk about your father."

09:33.508 --> 09:36.142
"Barney, I'm not going to teach
you how to hypnotize people.

09:36.144 --> 09:37.610
You'll only use it for evil."

09:37.612 --> 09:39.762
"Barney, I am not going
to conduct a couples session

09:39.764 --> 09:41.080
"between you and this woman.

09:41.082 --> 09:42.248
She's obviously a prostitute."

09:42.250 --> 09:44.217
I don't need this!

09:44.219 --> 09:46.703
Ah, Lily Aldrin,

09:46.705 --> 09:48.655
half of the world's
most perfect couple!

09:48.657 --> 09:50.557
I was thinking about
that woman's mouth comment,

09:50.559 --> 09:52.025
and I have
three good comebacks.

09:52.027 --> 09:54.827
Your mom didn't seem
to mind it last night on her...

09:54.829 --> 09:56.429
Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor.

09:56.431 --> 09:58.681
Would you mind driving out
to Kennedy with me

09:58.683 --> 10:01.167
to pick up this famous ecologist
for Marshall's fund-raiser?

10:01.169 --> 10:03.169
Apparently,
he only speaks Spanish.

10:03.171 --> 10:04.637
And you speak Spanish, right?

10:09.243 --> 10:11.277
Perfect. Let's go.

10:13.581 --> 10:14.747
Hey, Marshall, it's me.

10:14.749 --> 10:16.866
Listen, I know
I've been kind of a jerk

10:16.868 --> 10:18.017
about your leaving GNB.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.153
I just wanted
to call and say I'm sorry.

10:20.155 --> 10:22.388
No apologies necessary.
We're good.

10:22.390 --> 10:25.124
Good. Um, hey, any chance
you might maybe...

10:25.126 --> 10:26.993
I don't know...
if you're not busy,

10:26.995 --> 10:29.028
uh, want to have lunch today?

10:29.030 --> 10:31.864
Oh, buddy,
I'd love to, but I can't.

10:31.866 --> 10:32.999
Oh, that's cool.

10:33.001 --> 10:34.434
No biggie.

10:34.436 --> 10:36.636
Another time.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:54.688 --> 10:57.290
Oh, my God!

10:57.292 --> 11:00.026
How long have you been there?

11:00.028 --> 11:01.694
You don't remember?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.964
Hey. I was in the
neighborhood.

11:04.966 --> 11:06.633
I just wanted
to check in on you.

11:06.635 --> 11:09.168
You seemed, um, you seemed
really upset the other day.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.703
Oh, no, I'm fine.

11:10.705 --> 11:13.790
Okay. Well, um, you want
to go grab some lunch?

11:13.792 --> 11:17.910
Sure. Hey, are you okay if
I invite Marshall to join us?

11:17.912 --> 11:19.145
Yeah.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.299
Right.

11:23.301 --> 11:25.451
So, um...

11:25.453 --> 11:27.253
Chinese?

11:29.023 --> 11:31.324
You know, just
because Zoey and I

11:31.326 --> 11:33.993
are a different kind of couple
than you and Marshall

11:33.995 --> 11:35.761
doesn't make us a worse couple.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.815
You're right.

11:38.817 --> 11:42.785
I-If you and Zoey are happy,
then who am I to judge?

11:42.787 --> 11:45.705
I'm so sorry.

11:45.707 --> 11:49.409
Oh, my God, is
that how support feels?

11:49.411 --> 11:52.612
It's so warm and wonderful.

11:52.614 --> 11:54.714
Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.

11:54.716 --> 11:55.982
But I thought

11:55.984 --> 11:57.450
you liked being challenged.

11:57.452 --> 11:59.052
Nobody likes being challenged!

11:59.054 --> 12:01.754
Couldn't she agree with me just
once, even on something little,

12:01.756 --> 12:03.356
like... like what movie to see

12:03.358 --> 12:05.591
or-or what topping
to get on our pizza

12:05.593 --> 12:07.794
or... oh, I don't know,
my lifelong dream

12:07.796 --> 12:10.897
of building a skyscraper
in New York City?!

12:10.899 --> 12:12.899
Well, in her defense,
hamburger pizza, Ted?

12:12.901 --> 12:14.934
What are you, 12?

12:14.936 --> 12:16.903
You were right, Lily.

12:16.905 --> 12:19.906
I mean, Zoey's great,
but... sometimes I do wish

12:19.908 --> 12:23.660
we were a little more
like you and Marshall.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.247
TED
There he is. Here we go.

12:37.358 --> 12:38.458
I'm sorry.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.159
I don't speak...

12:40.161 --> 12:42.661
whatever it is you're speaking.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.164
Um, he speaks perfect English.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.349
Yeah, I-I know.

12:46.351 --> 12:47.700
Then why

12:47.702 --> 12:49.302
did you ask me to come?

12:49.304 --> 12:51.904
So you can drive him
to the fund-raiser.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.473
Supporting Marshall this much

12:53.475 --> 12:54.840
is driving me crazy.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.543
I'm going to Spain... my flight
leaves in 45 minutes.

12:57.545 --> 12:58.611
<i>Adios,</i>

12:58.613 --> 13:00.813
<i>muchacho.</i>

13:03.411 --> 13:06.544
W-Wait, what do you mean
you're going to Spain?

13:06.658 --> 13:08.742
You were right.
If I hear myself say

13:08.744 --> 13:11.161
"Baby, you have my full
support" one more time,

13:11.163 --> 13:13.013
I swear I'm gonna
murder someone!

13:14.065 --> 13:16.332
What are you gonna
tell Marshall, huh?

13:16.334 --> 13:18.902
And when are you coming back?
I honestly

13:18.904 --> 13:21.905
haven't thought it all the way
through, and I don't intend to.

13:21.907 --> 13:24.858
All I know is that
I'm a ticking time bomb,

13:24.860 --> 13:27.010
and if I don't do something
for me right away,

13:27.012 --> 13:29.946
I swear I'm gonna explode!

13:29.948 --> 13:32.649
Wow, tha... that's
an evocative metaphor to use

13:32.651 --> 13:35.085
for your nonthreatening,
totally patriotic emotions.

13:35.087 --> 13:36.420
U.S.A.!

13:36.422 --> 13:38.188
Okay, Lily, I get it.

13:38.190 --> 13:39.623
Marshall's been asking
a lot lately.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.859
But the thing to do is-is
tell him you've had enough.

13:42.861 --> 13:44.294
I've never been good at that.

13:44.296 --> 13:46.463
And now, ever
since his dad died,

13:46.465 --> 13:50.033
I-I feel like it's my job
to just be fine with everything.

13:50.035 --> 13:51.201
But I'm not.

13:51.203 --> 13:52.335
I'm not fine that

13:52.337 --> 13:54.337
he volunteers our apartment
for a giant fund-raiser

13:54.339 --> 13:56.056
and that he's
not thinking about

13:56.058 --> 13:57.808
how we're gonna pay
any of our bills

13:57.810 --> 13:59.042
and that, apparently,

13:59.044 --> 14:02.879
we've given up on
trying to have kids.

14:02.881 --> 14:04.881
Lil...

14:04.883 --> 14:07.901
Look, I'm sorry, Ted,
I just, I gotta do this.

14:08.886 --> 14:11.188
My bag?

14:11.190 --> 14:13.457
Oh, no. I got it.

14:15.660 --> 14:16.960
There's nothing to talk about.

14:16.962 --> 14:18.495
You trashed your office today.

14:18.497 --> 14:20.030
I mean, you obviously have

14:20.032 --> 14:21.932
some deep feelings
you're not confronting.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.934
And I think
they're about your dad.

14:23.936 --> 14:26.303
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
Why not?

14:26.305 --> 14:28.872
Because I don't. And why
am I explaining this to you?

14:28.874 --> 14:30.624
You're the most secretive
person I know.

14:30.626 --> 14:32.542
You never tell anybody anything.

14:34.112 --> 14:37.380
I've never...
told anyone this before.

14:38.683 --> 14:40.050
Um...

14:40.052 --> 14:42.085
I was 16.

14:42.087 --> 14:45.055
I was awakened around midnight

14:45.057 --> 14:46.990
by the sound of my father

14:46.992 --> 14:51.294
arguing with his business
partner, Andy Grenier.

14:51.296 --> 14:53.263
As things grew heated...

14:53.265 --> 14:57.267
I watched my father's hand
slowly coil

14:57.269 --> 15:00.871
around the heavy
antique clock on his desk.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.143
The sun was just
starting to rise

15:06.145 --> 15:09.412
over the bramble orchard as
we packed the fresh earth down

15:09.414 --> 15:11.414
with the flats of our shovels.

15:11.416 --> 15:12.816
My dad and I

15:12.818 --> 15:14.851
got our stories straight.

15:14.853 --> 15:18.522
We walked back to the house
in silence and...

15:18.524 --> 15:21.725
haven't talked about it since.

15:22.727 --> 15:24.961
But sometimes...

15:24.963 --> 15:27.597
on a still night...

15:27.599 --> 15:30.000
you can still hear that clock,

15:30.002 --> 15:31.668
ticking...

15:31.670 --> 15:33.303
ticking...

15:33.305 --> 15:34.838
ticking.

15:36.707 --> 15:38.475
That's...

15:38.477 --> 15:42.245
the most harrowing story
I've ever heard.

15:42.247 --> 15:43.747
Is it true?

15:43.749 --> 15:45.882
No.

15:45.884 --> 15:48.718
But it did get you
to drink three scotches,

15:48.720 --> 15:51.354
which is why you're
ready to spill your guts.

15:51.356 --> 15:52.822
Fine!

15:52.824 --> 15:56.626
The reason I'm upset
about Marshall leaving GNB

15:56.628 --> 16:00.664
is... is...

16:00.666 --> 16:02.299
Hey.

16:04.870 --> 16:06.870
...the meatball sub.

16:06.872 --> 16:07.837
Huh?

16:07.839 --> 16:09.606
It all started months ago

16:09.608 --> 16:11.441
in the GNB commissary.

16:11.443 --> 16:13.376
It was Meatball Sub Day.

16:13.378 --> 16:15.779
<i>Oh, how I used to love</i>

16:15.781 --> 16:17.030
<i>Meatball Sub Day.</i>

16:17.032 --> 16:21.084
<i>And then, the most</i>
<i>humiliating moment of my life.</i>

16:21.086 --> 16:23.486
Hey, buddy, I think
you got a tiny little bit

16:23.488 --> 16:25.455
of marinara sauce
on your tie there.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.797
<i>I plotted my revenge for weeks.</i>

16:33.799 --> 16:35.582
<i>But nothing seemed right.</i>

16:35.584 --> 16:37.567
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

16:37.569 --> 16:40.837
<i>The answer was</i>
<i>so elegant and simple...</i>

16:44.008 --> 16:47.227
<i>an exploding meatball sub.</i>

16:49.647 --> 16:51.881
<i>For months, I experimented.</i>

17:03.861 --> 17:07.196
More... marinara sauce.

17:08.082 --> 17:11.101
<i>Finally, the sub was perfected.</i>

17:11.103 --> 17:12.902
<i>The plan was in place.</i>

17:12.904 --> 17:15.472
<i>The snare was baited.</i>

17:15.473 --> 17:17.240
<i>And then...</i>

17:17.242 --> 17:19.909
he quit, Robin, he quit!

17:19.911 --> 17:20.877
It's Meatball Sub Day

17:20.878 --> 17:22.078
today, which is why

17:22.079 --> 17:24.130
I wanted Marshall
to come over and have lunch.

17:24.132 --> 17:25.214
But no.

17:25.217 --> 17:27.083
All that work wasted.

17:29.388 --> 17:33.857
You want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans, right?

17:35.092 --> 17:37.761
What is wrong with you?

17:39.063 --> 17:41.031
Hey, Professor Rodriguez,

17:41.033 --> 17:42.332
thank you so much for coming.

17:42.334 --> 17:43.433
Oh, my pleasure.

17:43.435 --> 17:45.068
I have to use the restroom.

17:45.070 --> 17:46.836
Do you have some
extra invitations?

17:46.838 --> 17:48.338
Right over there.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.506
Enjoy.

17:49.508 --> 17:51.291
Hey. Hey, thanks for
picking him up.

17:51.293 --> 17:53.326
Yeah, absolutely.
Um, listen,

17:53.328 --> 17:56.046
something happened
at the airport. Um...

17:56.048 --> 17:57.447
What?
Well,

17:57.449 --> 17:59.132
we got there, and, uh, Lily...

17:59.134 --> 18:00.783
Lily...

18:00.785 --> 18:01.785
Marshall, hey.

18:01.787 --> 18:03.720
Sorry, I, uh, I had to park

18:03.722 --> 18:05.639
and-and grab some ice.

18:05.641 --> 18:06.723
Sorry.

18:06.725 --> 18:08.124
Oh, thanks, babe.

18:08.126 --> 18:10.727
You would not believe
how much this one has done

18:10.729 --> 18:12.128
to help throw this party, Ted.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.730
I don't know how she does it.

18:13.732 --> 18:16.399
Can't be easy, huh, Lil?

18:17.902 --> 18:19.736
Yeah. Listen, Marshall,

18:19.738 --> 18:21.938
I-I need to talk to you
about something.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.506
No, you know what?
Me, too.

18:23.508 --> 18:25.075
Um... I want to thank you

18:25.077 --> 18:27.410
for being so supportive
of me in all this.

18:27.412 --> 18:29.479
I've been at the NRDC
for less than a week,

18:29.481 --> 18:31.348
and I've already done
more to be proud of

18:31.350 --> 18:33.516
than in two years at GNB.

18:33.518 --> 18:35.885
I can't believe
how good it feels.

18:36.787 --> 18:39.673
But now, it's time for me
to find a way

18:39.675 --> 18:41.891
to help the Earth
and get paid for it,

18:41.893 --> 18:44.728
because I can't put that
burden entirely on you.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.162
So, starting tomorrow,

18:46.164 --> 18:48.498
I'll look for something
with a paycheck.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.566
What do you think?

18:49.568 --> 18:52.719
Baby, you have my full support.
Oh...

18:53.637 --> 18:55.372
Ted.

18:56.273 --> 18:57.407
Hey!

18:57.409 --> 18:59.876
What are you doing here?
This is really important

18:59.878 --> 19:02.345
to Marshall, so I came
to show my support.

19:02.347 --> 19:04.381
This you can be supportive of?!

19:04.383 --> 19:06.282
What is that supposed to mean?
I have

19:06.284 --> 19:07.650
the chance to build
a skyscraper

19:07.652 --> 19:09.986
in the best city on Earth,
and who's the one

19:09.988 --> 19:11.654
leading the charge
to kill that dream?

19:11.656 --> 19:12.872
My girlfriend!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:12.874 --> 19:15.191
What about my lifelong
dream of not seeing

19:15.193 --> 19:17.127
every beautiful building
in Manhattan bulldozed?

19:17.129 --> 19:20.296
<i>And in that moment, I
realized, though I really cared</i>

19:20.298 --> 19:23.166
<i>about Zoey, I couldn't do this</i>
<i>for the next 50 years.</i>

19:23.168 --> 19:25.068
<i>I had to break up with her.</i>

19:25.070 --> 19:26.336
<i>But then...</i>

19:26.338 --> 19:31.591
♪ I will remember you ♪

19:32.693 --> 19:35.228
♪ Will you remember me... ♪

19:35.230 --> 19:37.147
<i>Kids, some couples</i>
<i>always support each other,</i>

19:37.149 --> 19:39.416
<i>and some couples</i>
<i>always challenge each other,</i>

19:39.418 --> 19:42.051
<i>but is one really</i>
<i>better than the other?</i>

19:42.053 --> 19:44.020
<i>Yes. Support is better.</i>

19:44.022 --> 19:45.955
<i>Way better.</i>

19:45.957 --> 19:48.942
<i>But I'd have</i>
<i>to learn that the hard way.</i>

19:50.890 --> 19:53.428
You're too young.
This isn't fair.

19:53.538 --> 19:54.771
We're not going
anywhere, buddy.

19:54.773 --> 19:56.606
We're gonna stay here
right till the end.

19:56.608 --> 19:57.807
Thank you, Marshall.

19:59.911 --> 20:01.211
Marshall...

20:01.213 --> 20:02.345
can I ask

20:02.347 --> 20:04.514
one final favor, my friend?

20:04.516 --> 20:07.450
Yes, of course,
of course... anything.

20:08.886 --> 20:11.688
Eat this meatball sub.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.024
Wh-Where'd you get
a meatball...

20:14.026 --> 20:16.793
I don't have much time!
Okay, yes, yes, of course.

20:16.795 --> 20:18.645
Of course.

20:20.399 --> 20:23.566
Does this have some sort
of special meaning?

20:29.807 --> 20:33.009
I'm not sick, you idiots!

20:33.011 --> 20:35.812
I've racked up $30,000
of uninsured medical bills

20:35.814 --> 20:37.614
for symptoms I don't even have.

20:37.616 --> 20:38.748
Totally worth it!

20:38.750 --> 20:41.000
You should see
the look on your face.

20:41.002 --> 20:44.454
Oh, wait, you can't... 'cause
it's covered in marinara sauce!

20:47.708 --> 20:49.659
Uh, Barney, you got
a little marinara

20:49.661 --> 20:51.327
on your pajamas.
