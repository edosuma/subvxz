[Schmidt] We should
let him on, sergeant,

02:48.185 --> 02:49.020
it's the right thing to do.

02:49.053 --> 02:50.121
[Guize] No, it's
out of the question.

02:50.154 --> 02:51.621
They'll die if we don't.

02:51.655 --> 02:54.225
Slow down, Lieutenant,
soldier getting on board!

02:54.258 --> 02:55.893
Come on, go, go, go!

03:33.297 --> 03:34.899
You can stop cowering now.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.936
What's your name, private?

03:40.537 --> 03:42.073
Private Theo Weiss, sergeant.

03:43.174 --> 03:44.541
Let's hope you
were worth risking

03:44.574 --> 03:47.178
all our lives for,
Private Weiss.

03:55.052 --> 03:59.156
I'm Sergeant Guize, this
is Leber, Fischer, Schmidt.

04:00.858 --> 04:03.094
Siebeler here was hit by
shrapnel this morning.

04:07.765 --> 04:09.033
Thank you for slowing down.

04:10.134 --> 04:12.535
Don't thank me, thank Schmidt,

04:13.670 --> 04:15.039
I wanted to leave you there.

04:17.041 --> 04:20.911
[explosions booming]

04:20.945 --> 04:22.847
Why weren't you
holding your position?

04:24.048 --> 04:27.151
We were told to uh,
fall back, and then,

04:27.184 --> 04:29.120
I got separated from my section.

04:29.153 --> 04:30.121
You didn't think
to find them again,

04:30.154 --> 04:31.822
you just ran away?

04:34.859 --> 04:36.827
I didn't run away.

04:36.861 --> 04:37.962
Really?

04:37.995 --> 04:39.897
Come on, leave him alone,
sergeant, he's just a boy.

04:41.899 --> 04:45.002
No place for boys,
haven't you realized that?

06:20.197 --> 06:21.731
I hope you don't mind
me asking, Lieutenant,

06:21.765 --> 06:23.234
but do you really think

06:23.267 --> 06:26.837
it was such a good idea
to bring your fancy piece

06:26.871 --> 06:27.704
along with us?

06:29.440 --> 06:31.842
She has a name, Muckel.

06:31.876 --> 06:34.178
[laughs] I know, I'm not
trying to be disrespectful

06:34.211 --> 06:36.947
or anything, I'm just
trying to understand.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.351
I mean, if we were in an
ambush she will slow us down.

06:43.220 --> 06:46.290
The only thing you need
to understand, private,

06:46.323 --> 06:49.326
is that she's a
collaborator in our service,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.295
she's safer with us
than where she was.

06:53.197 --> 06:55.933
I don't think she is,
Lieutenant, I mean the men...

06:55.966 --> 06:57.201
Thank you, private.

06:58.435 --> 07:00.971
Your concern has been noted.

07:08.245 --> 07:11.382
[truck engine clunking]

07:15.319 --> 07:16.353
Ah, shit.

07:19.290 --> 07:20.191

[suspenseful music]

07:31.202 --> 07:32.970
Right, we're out of
fuel, we're on foot,

07:33.003 --> 07:34.171
let's pack up and move.

07:40.411 --> 07:42.379
All right, you two get him down.

07:42.413 --> 07:45.082
Quickly, we haven't got all day.

07:47.284 --> 07:49.086
Would the lady like
some assistance?

07:49.119 --> 07:50.120
Thank you.

07:54.191 --> 07:55.025
Sergeant.

07:57.494 --> 07:58.996
You all right?

07:59.029 --> 07:59.863
I'm all right.

07:59.897 --> 08:00.764
Okay.

08:00.798 --> 08:01.999
Listen, do me a favor,

08:02.032 --> 08:03.867
keep your distance
from him, all right?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.169
Why, what's he about to do?

08:05.202 --> 08:08.806
He won't do anything,
just beware of him.

08:14.345 --> 08:15.913
Russians!

08:15.946 --> 08:17.014
Let's move!

[plane engine roaring overhead]

09:09.867 --> 09:11.602
Russian scum!

09:11.635 --> 09:15.072
Left another town
in rubble no doubt.

09:15.105 --> 09:18.042
Well, let's hope someone
shoots the bastards down.

10:40.524 --> 10:41.492
What do you see?

10:43.060 --> 10:43.660
I'm not sure.

10:45.996 --> 10:48.198
Right, go check it out.

11:02.446 --> 11:03.580
Anyone got a cigarette?

11:04.448 --> 11:07.151
Yes, thank you, Lieutenant.

11:07.184 --> 11:08.018
Well?

11:10.454 --> 11:11.522
And I'm keeping it.

11:11.555 --> 11:14.591
With all due respect,
Lieutenant, you smoke too much.

11:14.625 --> 11:18.195
No so thing as too
much, not in this game.

11:21.632 --> 11:23.066
How about you?

11:23.100 --> 11:23.700
Weiss, is it?

11:25.035 --> 11:26.503
You got another one of those?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.012
Last few, Lieutenant.

11:38.315 --> 11:39.683
Thank you.

11:39.716 --> 11:42.653
No need to thank me,
you saved my life.

11:44.488 --> 11:46.557
Don't get used to it boy,

11:46.590 --> 11:49.293
life out here's about taking
lives, not saving 'em.

11:52.196 --> 11:54.231
How long have you been
out here then, Lieutenant?

11:57.601 --> 11:58.735
[Lieutenant] Long enough.

12:05.609 --> 12:09.313
[Muckel] False
alarm, Lieutenant.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.180
Let's go.

12:25.462 --> 12:28.565
[Siebeler groaning]

12:28.599 --> 12:30.400
I wish they'd drop a bomb on us.

12:32.436 --> 12:33.504
Why'd you say that?

12:34.671 --> 12:36.640
'Cause it would be
a better way to die.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.175
You know the Nazis will kill us

12:38.208 --> 12:39.643
when we stop being
useful to them.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.045
I'm not going to
let that happen.

12:42.079 --> 12:44.181
Do you ever fantasize
about what you'd do to them

12:44.214 --> 12:46.583
if you get your
hands on a rifle?

12:46.617 --> 12:47.618
All the time.

12:47.651 --> 12:51.688
Well, we will, don't
know how yet but we will.

12:53.090 --> 12:54.591
I'm not going to
stop to fighting

12:54.625 --> 12:57.394
until every single one
of them is wiped off

12:57.427 --> 12:59.029
the face of the earth.

13:00.497 --> 13:02.099
How are we going to get a rifle?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.669
When we see our
chance, we'll take it.

13:09.606 --> 13:12.142
Women like her, they
don't fight them,

13:12.175 --> 13:13.610
instead they get
in to their beds

13:13.644 --> 13:16.179
and fill their heads
with our little secrets.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.082
Her mother and father should
hang their heads in shame.

13:19.884 --> 13:21.652

13:21.685 --> 13:22.719
Shh!

[Siebeler groaning]

13:43.841 --> 13:45.642
What the hell is this?

13:45.676 --> 13:48.345
I hope you put me in for
the Iron Cross, Lieutenant,

13:48.378 --> 13:49.847
captured these
two single handed.

13:50.949 --> 13:53.885
What do you expect the
Lieutenant to do with these two?

13:53.918 --> 13:55.887
You should of shot
them on sight.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.321
You want the Iron Cross

13:57.354 --> 13:58.522
for capturing a couple
of women, Muckel?

14:02.693 --> 14:04.094
Can they speak German?

14:05.195 --> 14:05.830
This one can.

14:09.166 --> 14:09.767
Who are you?

14:11.869 --> 14:15.606
Speak when the Lieutenant
is speaking to you!

14:15.639 --> 14:16.874
I know you can understand us.

14:18.642 --> 14:23.647
My name is Rosa Alexandrova
and this is Nina Mariakina.

14:26.751 --> 14:27.785
From where?

14:28.585 --> 14:31.722
What does it matter
where they're from?

14:31.756 --> 14:32.623
[gun cocks]

14:32.656 --> 14:33.724
We're wasting valuable
time, Lieutenant.

14:33.758 --> 14:34.826
What are you doing?

14:34.859 --> 14:36.493
I'm doing what you should
of done a long time ago.

14:36.526 --> 14:37.929
Isn't it dangerous to
fire a shot out here?

14:37.962 --> 14:39.363
It'll draw attention to us.

14:39.396 --> 14:41.698
It's not like we could
hang the bitches, is it?

14:41.732 --> 14:44.902
There's always strangulation,
drowning, stoning.

14:44.936 --> 14:46.838
You could always talk
them to death, hmm?

14:46.871 --> 14:49.272
What about a nice clean
slash to the throat then?

14:52.676 --> 14:53.510
Not a bad idea.

14:54.745 --> 14:56.680
Any volunteers?

14:56.713 --> 14:57.815
Leber would do it,

14:57.849 --> 15:00.183
he was a butcher in civilian
life, weren't you Leber?

15:02.920 --> 15:03.720
Wait!

15:03.755 --> 15:04.655
Wait!

15:04.688 --> 15:06.657
Please, wait, don't hurt us!

15:06.690 --> 15:07.959
We can help you!

15:07.992 --> 15:08.826
Help us?

15:10.762 --> 15:13.230
How exactly are you
gonna help us, hmm?

15:13.263 --> 15:16.768
Your man on the truck, he
needs morphine, iodine,

15:16.801 --> 15:20.604
clean bandages, I have all
of those in my medical kit.

15:32.716 --> 15:34.418
Can you repair a shrapnel wound?

15:36.754 --> 15:37.587
Yes.

15:38.488 --> 15:40.357
We're both trained nurses.

15:44.628 --> 15:45.462
Lieutenant.

15:49.499 --> 15:51.702
They come with us,
get 'em on the truck.

15:51.735 --> 15:52.937
Lieutenant, I must
protest, they can't...

15:52.970 --> 15:54.638
They can treat
Siebeler as we go,

15:54.671 --> 15:57.775
our orders are to move out,
get 'em on the god damn truck!

15:57.809 --> 16:00.677
[women whimper]

16:15.026 --> 16:17.694
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

16:21.331 --> 16:23.835
No ones gonna die today, okay?

16:28.505 --> 16:30.674
I will always protect you.

16:32.810 --> 16:34.979
I will always protect you.

[suspenseful music]

18:16.513 --> 18:17.581
Wait, wait!

18:25.122 --> 18:28.125
All right, go check
if it's clear.

18:49.679 --> 18:50.982
Fucking cannibals.

18:54.018 --> 18:56.386
I think we should cut
him down, Lieutenant.

18:57.188 --> 18:58.655
It's the least we can do.

18:59.924 --> 19:00.958
Agreed.

19:01.993 --> 19:03.593
Muckel?

19:03.627 --> 19:04.594
Cut him down.

20:01.819 --> 20:04.822
[Siebeler groaning]

20:05.990 --> 20:06.824

20:25.009 --> 20:27.278
Am I going to die?

20:27.311 --> 20:28.145
No.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.185
You're lyin'.

20:37.755 --> 20:39.656
Only your God can answer that.

[man gasps]

22:10.181 --> 22:11.714
You all right?

22:13.284 --> 22:17.021
Yes, yes I'm fine,
Lieutenant, thank you.

22:17.054 --> 22:17.888
Okay.

22:22.226 --> 22:23.894
[Nina crying]

22:23.928 --> 22:26.964
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:26.997 --> 22:27.832
Nina!

22:28.899 --> 22:29.834
Leber!

22:29.867 --> 22:31.235
[Leber] Get back, bitch!

22:31.268 --> 22:32.103
No, no.

22:33.237 --> 22:35.239
No, please don't!

22:35.272 --> 22:38.109
[gunshot fires]

22:38.142 --> 22:39.977
God damn it!

22:40.010 --> 22:42.179
Get him the fuck outta there.

22:42.213 --> 22:43.280
It's like shooting a dog.

22:43.314 --> 22:45.049
What the hell are you doing?

22:45.082 --> 22:46.817
Do you want the whole Red
Army to know where we are?

22:46.851 --> 22:48.152
Get back in position, now!

22:50.187 --> 22:53.157
[Nina sobbing]

22:53.190 --> 22:54.657
If you ever do anything
like that again,

22:54.691 --> 22:57.027
I will fucking kill
you, do you understand?

22:57.061 --> 22:58.062
Yes, Lieutenant.

22:58.095 --> 22:58.896
Do you understand?

22:58.929 --> 23:00.197
Yes, Lieutenant!

23:01.432 --> 23:03.267
We're gonna get
them back for this.

23:04.902 --> 23:09.273
We're gonna get them all back
for this, do you hear me?

23:11.842 --> 23:13.244
Here.

23:13.277 --> 23:15.146
What good is that?

23:15.179 --> 23:16.881
She just watched her father die.

23:19.350 --> 23:22.119
Sorry, yes, yes of course.

23:24.021 --> 23:26.290
It was a silly gesture, I
was just trying to help.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.030
You know, we're
not all like them.

23:35.332 --> 23:36.367
Oh really?

23:37.134 --> 23:40.304
You just stood by and
did nothing, didn't you?

23:40.337 --> 23:42.806
In my book, that
makes you just as bad.

23:44.909 --> 23:46.243
Just leave us alone please.

23:53.284 --> 23:55.920
We're going to get them back.

23:58.322 --> 23:59.323
Nina?

24:20.211 --> 24:21.045
Leber.

24:23.814 --> 24:24.714
Very nice.

24:27.284 --> 24:29.220
Enough of this, we need to go.

24:29.253 --> 24:30.321
It's a cigarette
case, Lieutenant.

24:30.354 --> 24:31.989
So what?

24:32.022 --> 24:34.525
Solid silver, engraved, could
be worth a few Reichsmark.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.194
One of these, then you
can stop stealing ours.

24:37.228 --> 24:39.496
Russian cigarettes taste
like shit, let's move!

24:46.103 --> 24:47.271
What's wrong?

24:47.304 --> 24:51.108
Nothing, I just forget what
cold blooded killers you are.

24:57.214 --> 24:58.048
Hey.

25:00.017 --> 25:04.255
Aliya, you know me,
you know me, okay?

25:08.492 --> 25:09.927
When can we be alone?

25:12.129 --> 25:14.398
Tonight, I promise.

25:18.269 --> 25:21.438
[Guize clears throat]

25:22.172 --> 25:24.441
Forgive the
intrusion, Lieutenant

25:24.475 --> 25:28.145
but the boys are ready to move
out, the sooner the better.

25:29.413 --> 25:31.081
Of course.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.017
Lieutenant, a moment?

25:34.084 --> 25:34.918
Fine.

25:55.506 --> 25:58.208
[Leber] Get up, come on!

25:58.242 --> 25:59.076
Quickly!

26:05.616 --> 26:07.985
[Lieutenant] Let's move!

26:25.169 --> 26:28.372
Take it, you've got
to eat something.

26:29.206 --> 26:30.140
I'd choke on it.

26:31.075 --> 26:32.543
You've got to stay strong.

26:33.677 --> 26:34.511
Why?

26:36.513 --> 26:37.481
To survive this.

26:40.017 --> 26:42.319
Maybe I don't want to survive.

26:42.353 --> 26:44.388
If you give up then
you're letting them win

26:45.923 --> 26:46.990
and we can't do that,

26:48.125 --> 26:49.893
they've taken enough
from us already.

26:50.994 --> 26:52.463
What would you know?

26:52.496 --> 26:53.497
Oh, I know.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.476
[solemn music]

28:31.295 --> 28:33.130
Let's have some fun.

28:46.343 --> 28:48.045
What's a pretty
young thing like you

28:48.078 --> 28:49.480
doing out here all alone?

28:52.649 --> 28:53.617
Don't you speak German?

28:56.286 --> 28:57.621
I do.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.556
Then answer me.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.191
I'm just going for a walk.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.161
She's just going for a walk.

29:07.664 --> 29:08.499
Boy or girl?

29:12.402 --> 29:13.737
It's a girl.

29:13.771 --> 29:15.539
It's a girl.

29:15.572 --> 29:16.707
Let me see.

29:16.740 --> 29:17.641
[Rosa] No.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.109
[Soldier] Give me the baby.

29:21.813 --> 29:22.646
No.

29:23.747 --> 29:26.116
Reminds me of my son back home.

29:26.149 --> 29:26.751
[baby crying]

29:26.784 --> 29:27.618
No, no.

29:32.623 --> 29:33.624
Please!

29:33.657 --> 29:34.725
Shut it up.

29:36.159 --> 29:37.661
Make her be quiet.

29:39.663 --> 29:41.064
Please, no, don't.

29:41.098 --> 29:42.099
Wants us to put it down.

29:42.132 --> 29:44.134
Please, give her back.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.204
No!

29:48.105 --> 29:48.739
No!

29:49.673 --> 29:50.707
No!

29:52.777 --> 29:53.610
Please!

29:54.678 --> 29:56.113
No!

29:56.146 --> 29:57.614
Please!

29:57.648 --> 29:58.482
No!

30:00.417 --> 30:01.251
No!

30:02.787 --> 30:04.454
No!

30:04.488 --> 30:05.322
No!

30:08.458 --> 30:11.128
[gunshot fires]

30:12.864 --> 30:15.632
[soldier laughs]

30:17.701 --> 30:20.404
Enjoy the rest of your walk.

30:55.773 --> 30:59.676
[Lieutenant and Aliya moaning]

31:54.297 --> 31:55.165
Sit down there.

31:58.335 --> 32:01.304
You don't eat, you don't drink
and you certainly don't piss

32:04.809 --> 32:06.911
without my permission,
is that understood?

32:48.518 --> 32:50.788
I plan on leaving as soon
as we get the chance.

32:52.422 --> 32:53.223
How?

33:00.965 --> 33:02.800
What good is a knife
against their weapons?

33:02.834 --> 33:03.734
That's suicide.

33:03.768 --> 33:04.769
Shh!

33:04.802 --> 33:06.603
Keep your voice down.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.673
We still have to try.

33:10.842 --> 33:15.046
Siebeler is getting
worse and once he goes,

33:15.079 --> 33:16.646
they won't need us anymore.

33:18.482 --> 33:20.350
Have you ever killed
anyone before?

33:21.351 --> 33:21.953
Of course.

33:21.986 --> 33:23.020
I meant with a knife.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.424
Don't forget that a knife is
far more intimate than a gun,

33:28.893 --> 33:30.594
you have to be close enough
to see their pulse beating.

33:30.627 --> 33:33.798
I've slit a pigs throat
before, is there a difference?

33:33.831 --> 33:36.067
[both chuckle]

33:36.100 --> 33:37.501
I said no talking!

33:59.456 --> 34:03.961
It's better when they're scared.

34:03.995 --> 34:05.963
Remind me again why
they're still with us.

34:07.464 --> 34:08.966
Brandt's orders.

34:12.569 --> 34:14.839
What do you think
they talk about?

34:14.871 --> 34:18.341
How am I supposed to know that?

34:18.375 --> 34:20.043
They're women aren't they,

34:20.077 --> 34:22.712
it's hard to understand
them at the best of times.

34:24.081 --> 34:26.449
It's been a long time
since I've had a woman.

34:30.087 --> 34:31.755
They're beautiful to look at.

34:32.824 --> 34:35.827
You know what they say about
Russian bitches, don't you?

34:35.860 --> 34:36.893
What?

34:37.929 --> 34:38.963
They like a bit of fun.

34:44.001 --> 34:46.904
They will probably
tear your balls off

34:46.938 --> 34:47.938
if you tried anything.

34:51.842 --> 34:52.944
Let's see, shall we?

34:56.112 --> 34:57.949
Perhaps it's time
to make amends.

35:09.861 --> 35:13.563
It's all right, I'm
not gonna hurt you.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.634
I just remembered that
I had some chocolate

35:17.667 --> 35:19.669
and wondered if you
wanted some, is all.

35:31.681 --> 35:32.582
Take a piece.

35:35.052 --> 35:35.887
It's very good.

35:38.155 --> 35:39.957
You're welcome to
share it with me.

35:41.225 --> 35:42.692
Leave 'em alone, Leber,

35:45.462 --> 35:47.564
they don't want
your old chocolate.

35:47.597 --> 35:50.600
[suspenseful music]

35:58.508 --> 35:59.944
How 'bout a cigarette then?

36:03.180 --> 36:04.481
I've got Russian ones.

36:05.983 --> 36:06.817
No, thank you.

36:38.748 --> 36:43.120
Look, I know I've been a
little hard on you recently.

36:47.258 --> 36:50.094
But I can be nice, if
you're nice in return.

36:54.597 --> 36:57.600
Do you think you
could be nice, hmm?

37:01.839 --> 37:03.207
Yes, I could try.

37:08.045 --> 37:09.080
Good.

37:14.551 --> 37:16.653
We'll share some
chocolate later then.

37:57.094 --> 37:58.661
Schmidt?

37:58.695 --> 38:00.197
Why does your food always
look like something

38:00.231 --> 38:01.766
that crawled out of a sewer?

38:04.068 --> 38:05.770
Tastes better than it looks.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.207
I quite like the smell.

38:15.046 --> 38:16.947
You know?

38:16.981 --> 38:18.816
It reminds me of home.

38:22.787 --> 38:24.188
What kind of home
did you grow up in?

38:25.655 --> 38:28.558
[Schmidt sniggers]

38:40.771 --> 38:43.941
That's a lot of
shelling over there.

38:45.276 --> 38:46.777
We're close to our lines now.

38:48.779 --> 38:50.848
Do you think we'll make
it back, Lieutenant?

38:54.985 --> 38:56.320
Cigarette?

38:56.353 --> 38:57.188
No, thank you.

38:58.355 --> 38:59.190
You sure?

39:01.192 --> 39:02.760
You look like you could use one.

39:02.793 --> 39:04.161
No, I'm fine, thanks.

39:07.031 --> 39:09.133
So what made you join up?

39:09.166 --> 39:10.201
My father.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.840
He said the Wehrmacht
would make a man out of me.

39:18.242 --> 39:23.013
I was the youngest of
my brothers, the weakest

39:25.748 --> 39:27.684
and oh, he hated that about me.

39:30.955 --> 39:33.023
So I wanted to join
up to make him proud,

39:35.126 --> 39:36.060
to be the hero too.

39:42.266 --> 39:44.034
How old are you, son?

39:44.068 --> 39:44.902
18.

39:48.205 --> 39:49.173
I joined when I was 17.

39:54.378 --> 39:56.280
It's the biggest
mistake of my life.

40:02.486 --> 40:06.290
I'm not cut out for
this, I'm not a killer.

40:13.297 --> 40:14.697
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,

40:14.731 --> 40:17.234
that's not what you
wanted to hear, is it?

40:17.268 --> 40:18.869
It's all right.

40:21.205 --> 40:25.075
You're stronger than
you think, you hear me?

40:29.146 --> 40:33.050
Pretty soon, you'll
be returning home

40:33.083 --> 40:34.985
with some nice shiny
medals on your chest

40:35.019 --> 40:36.921
that'll more than
impress your father.

40:38.455 --> 40:39.423
Your sweetheart too.

40:44.295 --> 40:46.797
I don't have a sweetheart.

40:48.032 --> 40:52.002
That'll change, ladies
love a man in uniform.

41:07.918 --> 41:10.921
[suspenseful music]

41:32.209 --> 41:36.914
Don't tell me Brandt's
neglecting you already?

41:36.947 --> 41:41.952
If you were mine, I wouldn't
leave you alone for a second.

41:42.486 --> 41:43.320
Don't.

41:44.455 --> 41:45.456
Why not?

41:46.490 --> 41:49.360
I saw you two in the woods
last night, very nice.

41:52.930 --> 41:57.835
But the mans got no finesse.

42:00.838 --> 42:03.340
It would never be
like that with me.

42:03.374 --> 42:07.478
It's no use looking to
Brandt to try and save you,

42:08.512 --> 42:12.383
he could die tomorrow and
then where would you be?

42:15.853 --> 42:18.455
It's far better to make
some other friends.

42:20.257 --> 42:21.859
Let me go.

42:21.892 --> 42:24.895
Be very, very fucking
careful, my dear.

42:27.131 --> 42:31.302
Without Brandt you are
nothing but a fucking whore

42:32.403 --> 42:37.408
and you will be treated as such.

43:19.516 --> 43:20.484
What's wrong?

43:23.520 --> 43:27.291
Nothing, I just, I just
wanted to be alone.

43:28.525 --> 43:30.561
I don't think you should
be out here alone,

43:31.462 --> 43:33.030
the Russians could see you.

43:34.198 --> 43:35.532
Then you shouldn't
be out here either.

43:36.400 --> 43:39.570
No, I want to be with you.

43:48.312 --> 43:53.317
I'm so tired of this war,
when will it ever end?

44:00.357 --> 44:01.525
I don't know.

44:05.496 --> 44:08.365
Every day things just get worse.

44:11.068 --> 44:15.239
The men are tired,
starving, morale is low,

44:22.679 --> 44:25.215
East Europe couldn't be
further away from here.

44:28.452 --> 44:30.654
Doesn't it ever make you angry?

44:30.687 --> 44:33.223
That your Fuhrer just
sent you all here to die?

44:34.158 --> 44:34.992
It does.

44:36.994 --> 44:40.097
In many ways, breaking
my oath the fatherland.

44:42.566 --> 44:44.067
Why don't we just leave?

44:45.536 --> 44:48.138
Why don't we just run away
from all of this together?

44:48.172 --> 44:49.640
Aliya, you know we can't.

44:49.673 --> 44:50.574
But why not?

44:50.607 --> 44:52.409
Because I can't abandon my men.

44:53.744 --> 44:55.546
Not to mention I'd be
executed for desertion,

44:55.579 --> 44:57.080
is that what you want?

44:57.114 --> 44:58.215
Of course not.

44:58.248 --> 44:59.416
Well then stop
talking such nonsense!

45:05.422 --> 45:10.127
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

45:13.597 --> 45:16.200
[solemn music]

45:25.275 --> 45:26.176
Do you love me?

45:39.590 --> 45:41.058
I gotta get back.

45:41.091 --> 45:42.326
Where are you going?

45:42.359 --> 45:43.293
Back to my men.

45:45.095 --> 45:46.396
Can't I at least get a kiss?

45:49.666 --> 45:51.435
Is that it?

45:51.468 --> 45:52.269
What more do you
want from me, huh?

45:52.302 --> 45:53.570
Payment for last night?

45:54.338 --> 45:57.140
I have given everything
up for you, everything

45:58.442 --> 45:59.443
and this is how you treat me.

45:59.476 --> 46:01.245
You gave up nothing,

46:01.278 --> 46:02.679
you just wanted to
save your own skin!

46:10.454 --> 46:12.689
How can you say that to me?

46:15.259 --> 46:16.093
I'm sorry.

46:20.097 --> 46:25.102
I don't know what I'm
saying, I don't know.

46:29.573 --> 46:33.243
I don't even know who
the hell I am anymore.

46:56.700 --> 46:57.634
What do you want?

47:00.437 --> 47:01.705
I just wanted to help.

47:01.738 --> 47:04.241
Doesn't your man
want you anymore?

47:04.274 --> 47:06.176
We all heard you arguing.

47:08.278 --> 47:11.181
Oh, careful, you
might break a nail.

47:14.651 --> 47:18.121
Look, I understand why
you might not like me

47:18.155 --> 47:19.824
but things aren't always
as black and white

47:19.857 --> 47:21.191
as they may seem.

47:21.224 --> 47:24.428
You don't need to
justify yourself to us.

47:24.461 --> 47:25.763
Seems black and white to me.

47:25.797 --> 47:27.865
Not when you're Ukrainian.

47:27.899 --> 47:29.767
The Soviets looks
my family's land

47:29.801 --> 47:32.135
and turned us in to refugees,

47:32.169 --> 47:35.272
we had to move from house
to house like nomads.

47:35.305 --> 47:36.506
When the Germans came,

47:36.540 --> 47:38.709
a lot of us saw them
as our liberators.

47:38.742 --> 47:39.543
Liberators?

47:39.576 --> 47:41.745
Yes, I wanted to
keep my family safe

47:41.779 --> 47:43.647
so I did what I was asked.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.515
I bet you did.

47:48.786 --> 47:50.855
I am not saying I am
proud of what I have done,

47:50.888 --> 47:53.490
I am saying there
was a reason for it.

47:53.523 --> 47:55.592
And where does
Lieutenant Brandt fit in?

47:55.626 --> 47:56.928
Did he liberate you?

47:56.961 --> 47:59.296
Joachim got me out of
a sticky situation,

48:00.397 --> 48:01.732
we ended up falling in love.

48:03.634 --> 48:06.871
When the war is over he said
he'll take me back to Germany.

48:06.904 --> 48:11.308
Men say all sorts of things
to get what they want.

48:12.275 --> 48:12.910
Not Joachim.

48:14.846 --> 48:16.747
Before the war he was
an artist, a composer,

48:16.781 --> 48:18.248
he's a good man.

48:18.281 --> 48:20.785
You're deluded if
you think that.

48:20.818 --> 48:22.854
Good men don't have
blood on their hands.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.814
Sergeant, there's a barn ahead,

48:49.847 --> 48:52.315
looks like we're good to go in.

48:52.349 --> 48:53.785
Okay, it's definitely clear?

48:53.818 --> 48:55.787
No movement as far as I can see.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.587
Okay.

48:57.621 --> 48:58.956
Muckel?

48:58.990 --> 49:01.759
Go with Leber, take
the girls to the barn.

49:01.793 --> 49:02.693
Go.

49:02.726 --> 49:03.761
Yes, sarge.

49:22.579 --> 49:23.781
Okay, it's clear.

49:34.959 --> 49:36.660
You better get back on watch.

49:49.841 --> 49:50.842
All quiet, Lieutenant.

49:52.375 --> 49:53.010
Okay.

49:54.377 --> 49:55.780
I'll send relief
in a few minutes.

49:55.813 --> 49:56.848
Sir.

49:58.715 --> 50:02.352
[explosion blasts]

50:02.385 --> 50:05.388
[suspenseful music]

50:28.678 --> 50:31.581
[woman whimpering]

50:40.758 --> 50:42.459
Don't fucking move!

51:32.542 --> 51:36.113
If we want to leave, now
is our chance to try.

51:37.982 --> 51:39.784
Look at how he's staring at you.

51:49.760 --> 51:50.828
Rosa, I can't.

51:53.130 --> 51:55.766
All you have to do is
make him drop his guard.

51:57.034 --> 51:57.835
No, no.

51:59.569 --> 52:02.940
It's you he wants, the
chocolate, remember?

52:05.009 --> 52:07.078
Okay, I'll do it

52:08.545 --> 52:10.647
but you have to be
ready to help me, okay?

52:12.749 --> 52:14.451
This is our only
chance to escape.

52:32.003 --> 52:32.970
What're you doing?

52:33.004 --> 52:33.938
Why're you standing up?

52:35.139 --> 52:40.044
Well, I'm hungry and I was
thinking about your chocolate.

52:43.948 --> 52:45.149
And your friend?

52:46.984 --> 52:48.085
Does she want some to?

52:49.519 --> 52:51.488
Oh yes, very much.

53:00.998 --> 53:01.899
All right.

53:13.811 --> 53:14.644
There.

53:16.579 --> 53:19.582
Not so scary without
my rifle, am I?

53:28.625 --> 53:29.459
Here.

53:31.062 --> 53:32.063
Thank you.

53:35.665 --> 53:36.499
And you?

53:40.670 --> 53:42.006
Don't be scared.

53:48.145 --> 53:50.147
You really are the
most beautiful thing.

53:54.118 --> 53:55.186
You both are.

54:23.814 --> 54:25.715
[Rosa] Get his rifle.

54:26.984 --> 54:29.652
[Leber choking]

54:36.127 --> 54:38.262
[gun cocks]

54:38.295 --> 54:41.165
[gunshot fires]

54:45.369 --> 54:48.571
[suspenseful music]

55:05.056 --> 55:06.157
Please don't shoot.

55:06.190 --> 55:08.625
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't.

55:08.658 --> 55:09.827
[Rosa] We've got to go.

55:09.860 --> 55:11.128
How do we know she
won't raise the alarm.

55:11.162 --> 55:12.695
I promise I won't.

55:12.729 --> 55:14.165
You better be telling the truth.

55:14.198 --> 55:15.598
I am.

55:15.632 --> 55:16.834
Take cover here until
the fighting's over

55:16.867 --> 55:18.269
and you should be fairly safe.

55:19.669 --> 55:21.072
Thank you.

55:21.105 --> 55:21.939
Good luck.

55:24.208 --> 55:26.709
[Aliya gasps]

55:32.116 --> 55:33.918
Nina, what are we doing?

55:33.951 --> 55:35.119
What do you mean?

55:35.152 --> 55:36.387
Well we shouldn't be running
away, we should be fighting.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.122
But we only have one rifle,

55:38.155 --> 55:41.258
if we go back there those
bastards will capture us again.

55:41.292 --> 55:42.960
I can get more weapons,

55:42.993 --> 55:44.762
if I circle around
on the Russian side

55:44.795 --> 55:46.063
I can pick some of them off.

55:46.097 --> 55:47.865
If you do that you'll
get yourself killed.

55:47.898 --> 55:49.333
They won't see me coming.

55:49.366 --> 55:51.869
Rosa, please, don't.

55:51.902 --> 55:52.735
Come with me.

55:54.205 --> 55:56.307
I'll come and find
you soon, I promise.

56:37.148 --> 56:39.817
[gunshot fires]

56:47.124 --> 56:49.894
Don't even think about it.

56:53.264 --> 56:56.100
Throw me your weapon
and your ammo, now.

57:00.771 --> 57:01.372
That's it.

57:06.210 --> 57:07.311
And the ammo.

57:21.325 --> 57:22.259
Are you gonna kill me?

57:24.528 --> 57:27.431
I would do but it's
far more satisfying

57:27.464 --> 57:29.400
knowing that you're going
to have to tell the others

57:29.433 --> 57:33.204
that you were beaten
by two Russian bitches.

58:00.531 --> 58:02.333
What the fuck is
Brandt playin' at?

58:03.334 --> 58:04.768
Those two should be dead.

58:05.769 --> 58:07.471
Perhaps he wants to get
information out of them.

58:07.504 --> 58:09.306
Yeah but he doesn't need to
keep them alive for that,

58:09.340 --> 58:10.174
does he?

58:12.042 --> 58:13.444
Are you gonna kill them, sarge?

58:16.280 --> 58:17.314
Not now.

58:19.149 --> 58:20.150
Maybe later.

58:33.030 --> 58:33.864
Mercy.

58:35.266 --> 58:36.967
Please have mercy on us,

58:37.001 --> 58:39.803
she's going to bleed to death
if you don't do something.

58:44.408 --> 58:45.376
What did she say?

58:47.344 --> 58:49.813
She wants us to help the girl.

58:49.847 --> 58:51.348
What the hell for?

58:51.382 --> 58:52.916
They're prisoners, not guests,

58:52.950 --> 58:54.451
we're not running
a fucking hotel.

58:55.986 --> 58:57.421
Go find the nurses.

58:57.454 --> 58:59.990
[Soldier] Yes, Lieutenant.

59:00.691 --> 59:02.893
Lieutenant, we need to find out

59:02.926 --> 59:04.895
how many more are
stationed near by.

59:05.863 --> 59:09.967
Tell them if they help
us then we'll help them.

59:14.538 --> 59:16.373
How many more of you are there?

59:17.875 --> 59:19.376
We'll help you if you tell us.

59:22.479 --> 59:24.214
We are the only ones left.

59:26.383 --> 59:28.452
She says it's just them.

59:32.389 --> 59:35.426
[woman whimpers]

59:35.459 --> 59:40.297
Shh, shh, shh, shh, what do
you think I'm gonna do, hmm?

59:42.132 --> 59:45.235
That doesn't look
very good, does it?

59:48.539 --> 59:52.042
I'm guessing you're
in a lot of pain, hmm?

01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:07.991
Now, if you want me to help her,

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:15.366
you're gonna tell us exactly
how many Russian soldiers

01:00:15.399 --> 01:00:17.935
are near by, you understand?

01:00:18.635 --> 01:00:20.504
How many more of you are there?

01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:23.140
And don't lie to me.

01:00:24.274 --> 01:00:26.410
I don't know, there
are many of us,

01:00:27.511 --> 01:00:29.380
there is an armored
division too.

01:00:32.249 --> 01:00:33.083
Thanks.

01:00:40.624 --> 01:00:43.327
Lieutenant, we need
to find our lines,

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.595
we're no use out here.

01:00:48.298 --> 01:00:49.266
[Lieutenant] Are you all right?

01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:54.571
Lieutenant.

01:00:58.175 --> 01:00:59.476
What the hell happened?

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.178
What happened?

01:01:01.211 --> 01:01:05.048
One of the Russian nurses,
she was in the woods,

01:01:07.418 --> 01:01:09.520
she got one of our
rifles and she shot me.

01:01:10.654 --> 01:01:12.423
What were they
doin' in the woods?

01:01:12.456 --> 01:01:15.159
Leber was supposed
to be watching them.

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:16.026
They escaped.

01:01:22.499 --> 01:01:25.469
You were with them, you
must of seen what happened,

01:01:25.502 --> 01:01:26.503
how did they escape?

01:01:27.638 --> 01:01:29.039
I don't know.

01:01:29.072 --> 01:01:29.506
What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.340
Back off!

01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:34.711
Take care of him,
take care of him!

01:01:52.362 --> 01:01:53.997
- Chin up.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:58.803 --> 01:02:00.504
You're gonna wish
you'd of taken me up

01:02:00.537 --> 01:02:02.272
on that fucking offer.

01:02:04.575 --> 01:02:07.444
You're okay, you're all right.

01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:10.280
Leber's dead.

01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:11.315
- How?
- Stabbed.

01:02:14.752 --> 01:02:16.353
Fuck this shit.

01:02:16.386 --> 01:02:18.188
[Lieutenant] Stand
down, sergeant!

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.060
[gunshots fire]

01:02:34.638 --> 01:02:37.274
Are you gonna shoot
me, Lieutenant?

01:02:37.307 --> 01:02:39.042
Stand down, sergeant.

01:02:39.076 --> 01:02:39.676
[gun cocks]

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.044
Now.

01:02:41.078 --> 01:02:42.679
If it wasn't for
your Russian bitches,

01:02:42.713 --> 01:02:46.683
we wouldn't be in this
mess and you know it.

01:02:46.717 --> 01:02:48.585
Siebeler needed
medical attention.

01:02:49.586 --> 01:02:52.055
They hardly nursed him
back to health, did they?

01:02:52.089 --> 01:02:54.525
Have you seen the
fucking state of him!

01:02:54.558 --> 01:02:57.327
And Leber's blood's
on your hands too.

01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.161
No, it's not.

01:02:58.195 --> 01:02:59.429
Aliya!

01:02:59.463 --> 01:03:00.464
Leber died because
he couldn't keep

01:03:00.497 --> 01:03:02.366
his filthy hands to himself.

01:03:02.399 --> 01:03:05.168
Ah, the whore has a tongue,

01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:06.103
it's a shame she didn't use it

01:03:06.136 --> 01:03:07.704
when it really fucking mattered!

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:13.811
You have five seconds
to make a choice,

01:03:13.845 --> 01:03:16.547
you either pull that fucking
trigger or stand down

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.815
because if you don't,

01:03:17.849 --> 01:03:21.585
I am gonna put a fucking
bullet in your face!

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.457
Your girlfriends a traitor,
she helped them get away.

01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:28.325
Four.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.595
Are you gonna stand
there and take orders

01:03:31.628 --> 01:03:35.299
from a man who would rather
put a whore before his own men?

01:03:35.332 --> 01:03:36.700
[Lieutenant] Three.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:39.202
She clouds your
judgment, Lieutenant.

01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:40.637
Oh yeah?

01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:43.307
She clouds yours too,
doesn't she Bruno?

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.474
Hmm?

01:03:44.508 --> 01:03:47.578
You don't think I don't notice
the way you look at her.

01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:49.279
Two.

01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:52.583
One!

01:04:00.758 --> 01:04:02.626
Standing down as
ordered, Lieutenant.

01:04:11.668 --> 01:04:13.871
Anyone else wanna
challenge my leadership?

01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:17.574
No, we're with you, Lieutenant.

01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:20.812
Get ready to move out in five.

01:04:43.768 --> 01:04:45.335
What are you doing?

01:04:45.369 --> 01:04:47.939
You have to go, you
can't stay with me.

01:04:47.972 --> 01:04:48.773
But why?

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:50.407
What did I do?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.643
I had nothing to do with
Leber's death, you know that.

01:04:52.676 --> 01:04:53.677
It's not safe.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:54.544
You keep me safe.

01:04:55.847 --> 01:04:57.915
I can't protect you if I'm dead.

01:04:57.949 --> 01:04:59.716
Oh, don't talk like that!

01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:00.550
Why not?

01:05:00.584 --> 01:05:01.385
It's the truth!

01:05:05.389 --> 01:05:06.223
Here.

01:05:06.256 --> 01:05:07.524
What's this for?

01:05:07.557 --> 01:05:08.358
For protection.

01:05:08.392 --> 01:05:09.226
Protection?

01:05:10.762 --> 01:05:11.896
What could hurt me more

01:05:11.929 --> 01:05:13.865
than what you're
doing to me right now?

01:05:14.899 --> 01:05:18.702
You're letting guys bully
you in to getting rid of me.

01:05:22.706 --> 01:05:24.441
Just go.

01:05:24.474 --> 01:05:27.444
[solemn music]

01:05:27.477 --> 01:05:29.346
Please don't do this.

01:05:29.379 --> 01:05:32.215
Please don't do this to us.

01:05:32.249 --> 01:05:36.687
We can still go to Germany
and make a life together.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:41.725
If I leave now, we may
never see each other again,

01:05:42.392 --> 01:05:43.493
is that really what you want?

01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:48.632
It's how it has to be.

01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:00.277
Take this.

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:00.945
No!

01:06:08.753 --> 01:06:12.890
Did I really mean nothing
to you, Lieutenant Brandt?

01:06:16.828 --> 01:06:18.863
I want to hear you say it!

01:06:30.373 --> 01:06:34.478
You were nothing more to
me than a cheap whore.

01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:46.791
You weren't the only one.

01:06:51.495 --> 01:06:52.329
Now go.

01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:55.565
Leave!

01:06:56.834 --> 01:06:57.667
Go!

01:07:09.814 --> 01:07:12.884
[Lieutenant sobbing]

01:07:20.925 --> 01:07:23.828
[Lieutenant screams]

01:07:52.023 --> 01:07:54.658
Are you okay, Lieutenant?

01:07:54.691 --> 01:07:55.993
That was my last cigarette.

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.903
You know what I mean.

01:08:05.937 --> 01:08:08.005
It must of been tough
to let your woman go.

01:08:11.776 --> 01:08:12.944
Where has she gone now?

01:08:13.911 --> 01:08:14.946
I don't know.

01:08:18.816 --> 01:08:20.383
I just pray to God she's safe.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.488
You did the right
thing, Lieutenant,

01:08:27.124 --> 01:08:29.060
you couldn't of brought
her to the frontline.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.031
Thanks, Schmidt.

01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:39.069
Go get some rest.

01:08:41.171 --> 01:08:42.471
Lieutenant.

01:09:11.903 --> 01:09:12.937
I can't be sure,

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:15.072
but I think I spotted
movement along the tree line.

01:09:15.106 --> 01:09:17.808
What do you mean,
you can't be sure?

01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:19.509
You either saw it or you didn't.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.778
It's difficult to tell.

01:09:22.947 --> 01:09:27.051
Our line's beyond those
trees, that's our objective.

01:09:27.952 --> 01:09:29.452
Well we need to be sure.

01:09:30.755 --> 01:09:31.856
We need a closer look.

01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:35.826
I can go, Lieutenant.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:37.727
Fuck no!

01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:39.130
I'm not placing my life

01:09:39.162 --> 01:09:41.497
in the hands of some
boy I barely know.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.004
I'll go.

01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:50.473
I'll check it out
and make the call.

01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:53.944
Stay here and wait
for my signal.

01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:22.739
[gunshot fires]

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.741
Lieutenant?

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:28.712
[Lieutenant gasping]

01:10:32.016 --> 01:10:33.050
No!

01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.587
Watch out!

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.156
We can't leave him out there.

01:10:43.861 --> 01:10:45.997
I'll keep them busy, go!

01:10:47.832 --> 01:10:49.566
Follow your orders.

01:10:52.336 --> 01:10:53.137
Sergeant!

01:10:58.342 --> 01:10:59.542
Follow your orders.

01:11:01.812 --> 01:11:04.015
What are you waiting for?

01:11:04.048 --> 01:11:04.949
Fall back!

01:11:14.058 --> 01:11:17.128
[machine gun firing]

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.001
Aliya?

01:11:28.339 --> 01:11:29.173
Aliya!

01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:33.878
[gunshots fire]

01:11:33.911 --> 01:11:36.646
[dramatic music]

01:11:59.669 --> 01:12:01.939
What the fuck was
that all about?

01:12:01.972 --> 01:12:04.141
That delay could of
cost us our lives.

01:12:04.175 --> 01:12:06.643
It wasn't easy for any of us

01:12:06.676 --> 01:12:08.112
to leave Lieutenant
Brandt, sergeant!

01:12:08.145 --> 01:12:12.116
Your job is to follow fucking
orders, private Schmidt!

01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:13.217
Nothing else!

01:12:18.823 --> 01:12:22.259
Brandt deserved better than
that, he was a good man.

01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:25.296
That's the problem
with war, good men die.

01:12:25.329 --> 01:12:27.730
But he died to
save us, Sergeant.

01:12:27.765 --> 01:12:29.400
He would of died anyway.

01:12:29.433 --> 01:12:30.868
We could of tried to help him,

01:12:30.901 --> 01:12:32.702
you know we could of at
least tried to help him.

01:12:32.735 --> 01:12:34.405
Corporal Fischer, I'm
beginning to question

01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:37.274
your ability to be
my second in command.

01:12:38.342 --> 01:12:40.878
Now are you someone that I
can trust to come with us

01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:41.979
to the frontline?

01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:45.216
Without question, sergeant.

01:12:46.817 --> 01:12:48.185
Good.

01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:49.954
What about you, Muckel?

01:12:51.822 --> 01:12:53.023
Schmidt, Weiss?

01:12:53.991 --> 01:12:55.392
Where does your loyalty lie, eh?

01:12:58.329 --> 01:12:59.763
With you, sergeant.

01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:02.299
Good.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.335
Glad to hear it.

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:06.669
Now let's finish this.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.714
What is it, private?

01:13:51.748 --> 01:13:54.752
I think our lines
are just over there.

01:13:54.785 --> 01:13:55.419
Okay, how far?

01:13:57.021 --> 01:14:00.224
Looking at it we've probably
got a quarter of a mile

01:14:00.257 --> 01:14:02.293
but I think we're
definitely past

01:14:02.326 --> 01:14:04.328
the point of no return now.

01:14:04.361 --> 01:14:05.963
Good, let's move.

01:14:46.837 --> 01:14:48.272
Muckel, you okay?

01:14:58.983 --> 01:15:00.451
Sergeant Guise reporting, sir.

01:15:05.856 --> 01:15:06.957
Very well, sergeant.

01:15:15.165 --> 01:15:16.367
My orders are to...

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.836
Your orders are
to stay here now.

01:15:20.404 --> 01:15:21.438
Yes, sir.

01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:31.515
Come here, come here, sergeant.

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:36.954
Let me give you some advice,

01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:42.092
you should of cut past
us and carried on.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.432
Invading Russia was meant
to be this great adventure

01:15:50.401 --> 01:15:52.403
and now it's a
fucking horror show.

01:15:58.008 --> 01:16:00.544
You better report to the
company, sergeant, get some food.

01:16:00.577 --> 01:16:01.378
Yes, sir.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.055
Good luck to you, sergeant.

01:16:14.224 --> 01:16:15.359
You're gonna need it.

01:16:16.927 --> 01:16:19.930
[suspenseful music]

01:16:38.282 --> 01:16:39.116
Sergeant?

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:54.331
What's she doing here?

01:16:54.365 --> 01:16:56.133
I thought she was long gone.

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:58.435
She's tryna draw us
out for the Russians.

01:16:58.469 --> 01:16:59.470
She'll get herself killed,

01:16:59.503 --> 01:17:00.504
let me pull her back here.

01:17:00.537 --> 01:17:02.339
No, no, no, you're staying here.

01:17:02.373 --> 01:17:04.375
We need to do something,
before they see her.

01:17:04.408 --> 01:17:06.377
That bitch is gonna
give away our position.

01:17:09.613 --> 01:17:12.516
Wait, you can't shoot her,
Brandt wouldn't want it.

01:17:12.549 --> 01:17:14.451
Brandt's not here though, is he?

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:21.258
Fucking shoot the
bitch, sergeant!

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:28.432
For God sake, Brandt loved
this woman, have some respect!

01:17:28.465 --> 01:17:29.967
Please, sergeant, no!

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.402
Stand down.

01:17:31.435 --> 01:17:33.370
Haven't you forgotten,
she's a dirty collaborator.

01:17:33.404 --> 01:17:35.172
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:17:40.677 --> 01:17:43.547
[gunshot fires]

01:17:54.024 --> 01:17:54.925
Bitch deserved it.

01:17:56.994 --> 01:17:58.495
If I hadn't of shot her,

01:17:58.529 --> 01:18:01.131
she'd of given away all our
positions and killed us all.

01:18:02.733 --> 01:18:04.635
You understand that, don't you?

01:18:04.668 --> 01:18:07.137
Are you sure that
was your motive...

01:18:07.171 --> 01:18:09.606
What the fuck is that
supposed to me, private?

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.474
Huh?

01:18:12.409 --> 01:18:13.243
Nothing.

01:18:25.155 --> 01:18:28.692
She was a whore
and a collaborator

01:18:28.725 --> 01:18:31.662
and that was my
only motive here.

01:18:34.331 --> 01:18:35.566
Now get back in position.

01:18:37.769 --> 01:18:38.602
Move!

01:18:47.611 --> 01:18:50.714
[explosions booming]

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:52.549
Weiss, what are you doing?

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.618
Get the fuck up!

01:18:54.651 --> 01:18:55.519
I can't take any more!

01:18:55.552 --> 01:18:57.789
Look, you've gotta
pull yourself together!

01:18:57.822 --> 01:18:59.523
No, I need to get out of here!

01:18:59.556 --> 01:19:01.759
Don't we all but you need to
dig and you've gotta fight!

01:19:01.793 --> 01:19:03.660
We need every single
last one of us

01:19:03.694 --> 01:19:05.362
to help hold our position.

01:19:05.395 --> 01:19:07.431
Yes, sergeant.

01:19:07.464 --> 01:19:09.801
Yes, sergeant, yes.

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:12.770
Look, I know Brandt pandered
to your moments of weakness

01:19:12.804 --> 01:19:14.571
but you're under me now,

01:19:14.605 --> 01:19:18.342
that means you fight
like a fucking man!

01:19:18.375 --> 01:19:19.543
I'm not as brave as
you though, sergeant,

01:19:19.576 --> 01:19:21.211
I'm not as brave!

01:19:21.245 --> 01:19:22.246
It's not about bravery,
it's about following orders!

01:19:25.182 --> 01:19:27.618
I don't need to remind
you of how the Third Reich

01:19:27.651 --> 01:19:30.788
deals with deserters,
do I, private Weiss?

01:19:30.822 --> 01:19:33.590
You're either for us
or you're against us,

01:19:33.624 --> 01:19:35.559
there's no middle ground.

01:19:35.592 --> 01:19:37.528
I'm not a deserter,
sergeant, I'm not a deserter.

01:19:37.561 --> 01:19:39.162
Good, well prove it!

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:41.766
Let's go, you're coming with me.

01:19:43.166 --> 01:19:45.536
Look, I volunteered
to take a patrol out

01:19:45.569 --> 01:19:47.671
to take out that Russian
sniper that's picking off

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:51.341
all our men, you come
with me and we survive,

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:53.410
I promise to get you
some time as a runner,

01:19:53.443 --> 01:19:56.246
does that sound
like a fair deal?

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.681
Sergeant.

01:19:57.714 --> 01:19:59.683
Yes, sergeant, yeah.

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:04.388
So let's go, come on, let's
go, let's move, let's move!

01:20:04.421 --> 01:20:05.656
[bomb whistling]

01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:06.523
Incoming!

01:20:08.258 --> 01:20:09.426
Hold the line!

01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:17.835
[explosions booming]

01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:13.256
I've seen that look before.

01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:17.628
Sergeant?

01:21:20.898 --> 01:21:24.134
The eyes of a man who's
never killed before.

01:21:30.374 --> 01:21:34.244
Am I wrong?

01:21:34.277 --> 01:21:35.545
No, sergeant.

01:21:38.916 --> 01:21:39.817
Thought as much.

01:21:43.855 --> 01:21:45.455
What's it like?

01:21:47.859 --> 01:21:49.593
What?

01:21:49.626 --> 01:21:50.427
To kill?

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:02.172
I remember the first
person I killed,

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:08.745
it was a direct order.

01:22:11.715 --> 01:22:15.452
I was in the firing squad
and it was a female partisan.

01:22:27.799 --> 01:22:31.468
That kind of thing never
leaves a man, ever.

01:22:33.704 --> 01:22:38.308
See, it's about bravery,
boy, pure bravery.

01:22:41.813 --> 01:22:44.715
You've either got
it or you ain't,

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.855
it's as simple as that.

01:22:52.422 --> 01:22:54.524
My brother used to
say something similar,

01:22:56.994 --> 01:22:58.963
he never wanted me
to be a part of this.

01:23:05.702 --> 01:23:06.871
I think he thought
it would all be over

01:23:06.904 --> 01:23:08.840
by the time I was
old enough to enlist.

01:23:11.809 --> 01:23:13.677
I dunno what he'd
make of it all now.

01:23:17.949 --> 01:23:19.851
I think he cared for
his little brother.

01:23:23.487 --> 01:23:26.924
I'd write him these
letters, stories and things,

01:23:27.859 --> 01:23:29.459
he said they kept him going.

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:34.031
So you're a writer then?

01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:38.435
Not really, well maybe one day.

01:23:49.914 --> 01:23:50.948
Could you...

01:23:54.651 --> 01:23:55.485
Maybe...

01:23:58.756 --> 01:23:59.957
Could you write me a letter?

01:24:03.961 --> 01:24:04.862
Of course, sergeant.

01:24:10.734 --> 01:24:12.435
I want to write a girl back home

01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:15.672
but I've never been
good with words.

01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:19.877
What's her name?

01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:23.815
[leaves rustle]

01:24:23.848 --> 01:24:25.116
What was that?

01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:28.351
[suspenseful music]

01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:10.928
[twig snaps]

01:25:11.996 --> 01:25:14.531
[gun cocks]

01:25:30.747 --> 01:25:31.581
Weiss!

01:25:34.517 --> 01:25:36.921
Fucking shoot the bitch!

01:25:36.954 --> 01:25:39.824
[both struggle]

01:26:00.644 --> 01:26:01.511
Sergeant!

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:03.981
Sergeant, she's dead, sergeant.

01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:21.065
[explosion booms]

01:26:31.008 --> 01:26:34.145
Any idea what's
wrong with Weiss?

01:26:34.178 --> 01:26:36.080
I made the mistake of
bringing him with me

01:26:36.113 --> 01:26:38.049
to take out that Russian sniper.

01:26:40.017 --> 01:26:42.619
Thought it'd take his
mind off things, you know.

01:26:44.521 --> 01:26:45.156
And did it?

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:52.029
Turns out private Weiss finds
killing women offensive.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.037
Even when they're tryna
blow your fucking head off.

01:27:03.007 --> 01:27:04.741
The Red Army's
teaming with them.

01:27:05.876 --> 01:27:10.647
This bitch was
strong, brave too,

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.117
can't say I took much
pleasure in killing her.

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:16.120
Well, that'll be the closest
you've been to a woman

01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:17.054
in ages, sergeant.

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:21.691
[all snigger]

01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:33.137
You need to eat,

01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:34.972
it'll do you good to get
some hot food down you.

01:27:35.006 --> 01:27:36.007
I'm not hungry.

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:39.642
You do know your
mission out here

01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.078
is stay alive, don't you?

01:27:41.112 --> 01:27:42.847
Eating what you're given
is just as important

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.881
as dodging a bullet.

01:27:46.951 --> 01:27:48.718
Everything I eat
tastes of blood.

01:27:49.586 --> 01:27:51.621
You're letting yourself
think too much.

01:27:53.057 --> 01:27:56.193
The trouble with war is that
if you're not killing people,

01:27:56.227 --> 01:27:58.229
you're just sitting
around killing time.

01:28:01.132 --> 01:28:03.700
I keep seeing the faces of
the people we've killed.

01:28:04.902 --> 01:28:05.970
You just gotta shut
it out of your head.

01:28:06.003 --> 01:28:06.971
No, I can't.

01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:11.175
Then why don't you think
about something good instead?

01:28:12.076 --> 01:28:13.110
It's what I do.

01:28:25.655 --> 01:28:27.191
I think about Freida.

01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:33.831
Red lips, the way she moves,

01:28:36.367 --> 01:28:38.769
all those times
we've spent together,

01:28:40.171 --> 01:28:41.738
that's what keeps me going.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.978
You're lucky, I don't have
a girl waiting for me.

01:28:49.947 --> 01:28:51.648
I hope I get to
see her again soon.

01:28:55.352 --> 01:28:56.187
Please eat.

01:28:58.222 --> 01:28:59.857
You've just gotta
keep your head up

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:02.226
and give yourself a
reason to keep on going.

01:29:02.259 --> 01:29:03.294
All right, I'll try.

01:29:04.228 --> 01:29:05.930
Things could be worse, you know,

01:29:06.931 --> 01:29:09.732
at least you don't have to share
a slit trench with Fischer.

01:29:20.778 --> 01:29:23.214
[bomb whistling]

01:29:23.247 --> 01:29:24.747
Russians!

01:29:24.782 --> 01:29:26.283
Here they come!

01:29:26.317 --> 01:29:29.386
[explosions booming]

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.196
[gunshots firing]

01:30:04.054 --> 01:30:05.189
Hold the line!

01:30:06.357 --> 01:30:07.358
Return fire!

01:30:18.235 --> 01:30:19.036
[Weiss] What do we do?

01:30:19.069 --> 01:30:21.071
We have to go, get up!

01:30:22.306 --> 01:30:24.008
Fight!

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:25.209
Hold the line!

01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:29.380
[dramatic music]

01:31:02.213 --> 01:31:04.348
[gun cocks]

01:31:06.817 --> 01:31:09.920
[explosions booming]

01:31:13.891 --> 01:31:17.127
[high pitched ringing]

01:31:36.347 --> 01:31:39.383
[gunshots firing]

01:32:34.004 --> 01:32:35.306
Hold the line!

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:40.377
[gun jams]

01:32:40.411 --> 01:32:41.245
Shit!

01:32:57.361 --> 01:32:58.329
Fall back!

01:33:18.682 --> 01:33:21.218
[gun cocks]

01:33:24.588 --> 01:33:27.424
[explosion booms]

01:33:51.415 --> 01:33:53.917
[Weiss gasps]

01:34:03.427 --> 01:34:05.562
[gun cocks]

01:34:08.399 --> 01:34:11.068
[gunshot fires]

01:34:46.069 --> 01:34:48.539
[Weiss sobbing]

01:35:18.803 --> 01:35:21.672
[gunshot fires]

01:35:54.705 --> 01:35:57.374
[gunshot fires]

01:36:12.656 --> 01:36:15.726
[gunshot fires]

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.396
[Weiss groaning in pain]

01:37:28.632 --> 01:37:29.466
Thank you.

01:37:49.419 --> 01:37:51.655
[squelching]

01:38:03.734 --> 01:38:07.371
[Weiss groaning in pain]

01:38:29.426 --> 01:38:31.796
[solemn music]

01:39:15.272 --> 01:39:16.874
Wait, wait, wait.

01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:19.543
Please don't leave me.

01:39:19.576 --> 01:39:21.478
If you stay here
until night falls,

01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:23.915
it should be fairly
safe for you to move on.

01:39:26.818 --> 01:39:27.952
Why're you helping me?

01:39:33.858 --> 01:39:37.728
Sometimes the nurse in
me overrides the soldier.

01:39:40.932 --> 01:39:44.301
Makes me feel human again.

01:39:46.871 --> 01:39:51.843
You stay alive, Weiss, make
it back to your loved ones.

01:40:22.302 --> 01:40:25.924
