WEBVTT

00:19.500 --> 00:20.667
Alright, open up, son.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.875
I can't do it by myself.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.625
Come on,
no half steppin', ladies.

00:27.625 --> 00:28.625
Push it up.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.166
Six feet, girls.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.250
First shift burrowed under
the river five feet.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.458
That means that we go six.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.458
That's a nice shiny
new
helmet there, Nate.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.458
Couldn't get one
with a little flashlight?

00:44.542 --> 00:48.792
Wife wouldn't let me back down
in the hole without a hard hat.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.625
At least your old lady cares
if you get cracked in the
dome.

00:51.709 --> 00:54.333
Oh, my sister treating
you that bad these days?

00:54.417 --> 00:55.959
What do you mean
these days?

00:56.041 --> 00:57.667
Tell you what Alice
cooked up last night

00:57.750 --> 00:59.375
but I don't
want
to rub it in.

00:59.458 --> 01:00.959
You're lucky you got
a woman like that.

01:01.041 --> 01:03.333
Woman who don't give a man
no quarter, you mean.

01:08.041 --> 01:10.917
Cave-in or blowout don't get
your father-in-law

01:11.000 --> 01:12.083
that cough will.

01:12.166 --> 01:13.709
He ought to retire.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.542
Let someone else carry
the weight of foreman.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.792
- That'll be you, Donny.
- You think?

01:17.875 --> 01:20.667
Like I said, my wife's
counting
on you to bring all of us

01:20.750 --> 01:21.750
up out of here.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.583
All them stories you tell..

01:23.667 --> 01:26.125
...it'd be nice to finally
meet old Alice.

01:26.208 --> 01:28.125
Not in this here world.

01:28.208 --> 01:31.667
Down here, every Joe's blood
runs brown, same as the muck.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.250
But not up there.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.250
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.750
Get back to work.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.458
Hey, Nate!

01:50.875 --> 01:53.166
Watch it there, Nate.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.375
Eight million ways to die
every day.

01:56.458 --> 01:59.458
Not today. Not today.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.750
(Valens)
'Figure on stretching
that shirt out another day?'

02:54.458 --> 02:56.417
You wanna check my
shorts there too, hoss?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.959
Transit workers found the
body
expanding the subway.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.834
Five stories
under the
river.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.333
I ain't going
down there.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.500
What's the matter,
don't like tunnels?

03:06.583 --> 03:08.750
They got rats
the size of badgers.

03:08.834 --> 03:12.000
No, man, even the
rats
hate it down there.

03:12.083 --> 03:15.583
Bulldozer broke through an old
service tunnel. Found the
bones.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.500
(Stillman)
'Adult male. Blunt force
trauma to the skull.'

03:18.583 --> 03:22.125
Found behind a tunnel
that got sealed in 1948.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.208
Guy needs a paleontologist,
not a detective.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.166
Could be one
of those mole people.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.000
Wasn't a mole,
this was a sandhog.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.333
- Sandhog?
- Urban miner.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.375
Died with
his boots
on.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.375
"Compressed Air Worker,
number 505.

03:35.458 --> 03:36.667
"If found sick or unconscious

03:36.750 --> 03:39.291
"return to medical
decompression lock

03:39.375 --> 03:40.959
at Bertleman
Construction site."

03:41.041 --> 03:43.792
Sandhogs were required to carry
those badges at all times

03:43.875 --> 03:45.625
in case of an attack
of the bends.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.000
How's a miner
get the bends?

03:47.083 --> 03:49.083
Working deep underground
in compressed air.

03:49.166 --> 03:51.458
Tunnels, subways,
sewers, you name it.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.792
Say if it's deeper than
a grave, a sandhog dug
it.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.959
Looks like this poor schmuck
might have dug his own.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.208
You see those miners
trapped on the news

03:58.291 --> 04:00.417
they move heaven
and earth to get a guy out.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.125
At least, recover a body.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.041
This guy didn't
get left behind.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.959
He got buried on purpose.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.542
Donuts.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.125
Is that some kind
of cop joke?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.375
What, cops are the only ones
allowed to eat fried dough?

04:53.458 --> 04:56.875
- I never eat donuts.
- Never?

04:56.959 --> 04:59.166
Mmm, mmm.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.875
Oh, you have sugar
on your cheek.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.792
- Come on and get it.
- Get over here.

05:03.875 --> 05:05.875
Got to eat
a donut
first.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.709
- I don't want a stupid
donut.
- No, first.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.333
Come on. Yum.

05:10.417 --> 05:12.750
- Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
- Fine. Give me the bag.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.166
Attagirl.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.250
Pretty damn good.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.417
I love you.

05:27.792 --> 05:28.875
Yeah?

05:28.959 --> 05:31.458
Yeah, definitely.

05:31.542 --> 05:32.709
I, um..

05:35.291 --> 05:36.583
I don't know what to say.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.041
Ah, you're a detective,
you'll figure it out.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.959
Look, okay, I gotta run.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.125
- I'll call you later?
- Sure, right.

05:56.166 --> 05:59.333
I had OSHA check the state
archives on this one.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.917
Compressed Air 505
was registered

06:02.000 --> 06:03.709
as a John Donovan.

06:03.792 --> 06:06.917
- John Boomer Donovan.
- What, you familiar?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.834
Down-in-the-muck
sandhog became head

06:08.917 --> 06:11.250
of the Local 37
back in the '40s.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.917
He was reported
missing in 1948.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Donovan turned hero
after he took on management

06:17.083 --> 06:18.792
'then mysteriously
disappeared.'

06:18.875 --> 06:20.166
You know your sandhog
history, boss.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.500
Neighborhood I grew up in, Lil

06:21.583 --> 06:24.375
you either became a cop,
a fireman or a sandhog.

06:24.458 --> 06:28.125
And I got this thing about
being
burned or buried alive.

06:28.208 --> 06:32.417
So how do we know our guy wasn't
just crushed in a cave-in?

06:32.500 --> 06:35.250
Disappeared on a Sunday
back in '48.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.875
He wasn't down there working.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.625
Theory at the time
was Donovan took on

06:38.709 --> 06:40.542
management in
a labor dispute.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.291
Thought he bought
himself a pair of cement shoes

06:42.375 --> 06:44.125
and a one-way ticket
to the bottom of the river.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.542
But couldn't prove it
without a body.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.959
Only surviving next of kin's
a brother-in-law.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.792
Robert McCallister.

06:50.875 --> 06:51.792
An old sandhog?

06:51.875 --> 06:53.291
Former head of the union.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.875
If he's not at
home,
check down

06:54.959 --> 06:57.291
at Mulrooney's
in Devil's
Pocket.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.834
What's that, a sandhog bar?

06:58.917 --> 07:01.834
We got Jones Tavern,
they got Mulrooney's.

07:08.792 --> 07:12.375
Keep Donovan's photo up there
with the top-shelf whiskey.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.291
[chuckles]
They're still
buyin' him shots.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.333
Donovan was married
to your sister?

07:19.417 --> 07:21.250
Yeah, I introduced them.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.458
A lot of sandhogs
in your family?

07:23.542 --> 07:25.458
Third generation.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.917
My old man spent 30 years
in the hole.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.333
'Big Mac.'

07:32.000 --> 07:33.959
Nice lighter.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.291
Thanks.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.834
A gift from Big Mac
on my wedding day.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.875
Only thing that could hold
a flame in the tunnels.

07:41.959 --> 07:45.250
We hear management had it out
for your brother-in-law.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.750
Sam Bertleman did.
Everyone knew it.

07:49.834 --> 07:52.041
The head of Bertleman
Construction?

07:52.125 --> 07:54.250
None other.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.208
The guys were going deaf
down in the hole

07:56.291 --> 07:58.458
getting killed, maimed.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.041
Didn't stop that
greedy bastard.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.542
But Donovan tried to.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.542
Donny became foreman,
he was the only one

08:03.625 --> 08:07.041
that had the stones
to take the boss man
on.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.166
When did he start
organizing the men?

08:09.250 --> 08:11.583
Just after his pal Nate
died in the hole?

08:11.667 --> 08:13.542
There was no stoppin' him.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.375
(male #1)
'Bobby?'

08:32.458 --> 08:33.709
'Bobby!'

08:34.792 --> 08:35.709
Bobby!

08:35.792 --> 08:38.208
I'm here, pop.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.291
Where's Donny?

08:45.166 --> 08:46.500
Donny!

08:47.792 --> 08:49.125
Donny, you okay?

08:52.375 --> 08:55.291
You son of a bitch!

08:55.375 --> 08:57.000
There was no masks
in there, nothing!

08:57.083 --> 08:59.417
- You knew that!
- Leave it be!

08:59.500 --> 09:00.959
We didn't have a chance!

09:02.792 --> 09:04.125
(Alice)
'Nate?'

09:05.667 --> 09:06.917
'Nate?'

09:08.542 --> 09:09.917
You're his wife?
You're Alice?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.917
Where is he?
Where is my husband?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.792
You left him down there?

09:14.875 --> 09:16.458
It happened so fast.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.875
'We could barely see.
The smoke was everywhere.'

09:18.959 --> 09:19.959
Nate!

09:20.041 --> 09:22.792
'Nate! Nate!'

09:22.875 --> 09:24.041
No!

09:24.125 --> 09:25.709
Nate!

09:25.792 --> 09:28.792
No! No! No!

09:28.875 --> 09:31.333
[crying]
No! No.

09:32.375 --> 09:35.000
'Wake up, Nathan!
Wake up.'

09:35.083 --> 09:37.125
'You promised me!'

09:37.208 --> 09:39.667
You promised me
you'd come home to me!

09:42.500 --> 09:43.750
Alice.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.834
Alice.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.750
I'm so sorry, Alice.
I really am.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.166
You were supposed
watch

10:03.250 --> 10:04.750
You were his friend!

10:13.542 --> 10:15.000
Couldn't blame her.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.625
But it was misdirected.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.166
Bertleman didn't
give a rat's ass

10:18.250 --> 10:20.083
about the safety
of any of his workers.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.667
And that's when Donovan
started organizing the
men?

10:23.750 --> 10:26.583
Few months later,
he disappears.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.709
Mary said he went off
to the pub, never came home.

10:29.792 --> 10:33.458
You figure Bertleman had
your brother-in-law killed?

10:33.542 --> 10:35.500
Donovan was about
to lead a walkout.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.875
You tell me.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.834
Sam Bertlemen?

10:50.417 --> 10:51.417
Somewhere
we can talk?

10:51.500 --> 10:53.375
Yeah. I'm kind
of busy right now.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.709
(Miller)
'So are we.'

10:54.792 --> 10:56.333
Just found John
Donovan's body

10:56.417 --> 10:57.667
in a tunnel under
the Schuylkill.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.417
Not to slow you down
or anything.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.041
It's got
nothing to do with me.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.792
Might have
with your old man.

11:02.875 --> 11:06.166
My father built this city,
every damn tunnel.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.250
You think that's the first
body
that's turned up underground?

11:09.333 --> 11:10.875
(Rush)
'This is one
of his workers.'

11:10.959 --> 11:12.041
A union leader, too.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.834
Look, the last thing
my old man wanted

11:13.917 --> 11:16.625
was to make John Donovan
some kind of martyr.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.417
Funny how he turned
up dead then.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.333
They blamed my pops
'cause it was easier

11:20.417 --> 11:22.458
than looking at
one of their own.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.250
You sayin'
another
sandhog did it?

11:24.333 --> 11:27.917
All that band of brothers
union stuff. Bunch of BS.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.041
'There's this one guy,
Zaccardo
always causing trouble.'

11:36.583 --> 11:38.208
It ain't right
what happened to Nate.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.750
But not a damn thing's gonna
change till we make it change.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.458
Wrong tree, Donny boy.
Go bark somewheres else.

11:43.542 --> 11:44.917
Nate was one of
us, Zaccardo.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.417
One of our
brothers.
We owe him.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.750
You wanna walk off the job
over some dead spade? Go ahead.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.792
- What'd you call him?
- You crossed the line.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.166
Making a fool of yourself
with that bugaboo widow

11:55.250 --> 11:56.875
in front of everyone.

11:56.959 --> 11:59.041
Shut your mouth!

12:05.083 --> 12:07.667
- 'Enough!'
- Not your concern, old man.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.625
You don't talk
about her like that!

12:10.709 --> 12:11.792
Shut up, Donny.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.709
- It's over.
- Oh, it ain't over.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.250
I promise you that.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.792
My first scaling bar, huh?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.166
Bash a man's skull in
with that.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.709
Donovan had guts

12:29.792 --> 12:32.500
but Mateo Zaccardo
was a mean son of a bitch.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.792
Didn't appreciate
being humiliated.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.250
You think he
killed
Donovan?

12:37.333 --> 12:38.750
He was a sandhog

12:38.834 --> 12:41.000
and down in that hole,
anything can happen.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.166
Any idea where
Zaccardo ended up?

12:43.250 --> 12:45.125
Last I heard, prison.

12:45.208 --> 12:48.208
Caved some poor bastard's
head in during a bar fight.

12:58.667 --> 13:02.000
(Valens)
'Life for second
degree murder.'

13:02.083 --> 13:05.166
Killed a man with a
crowbar
outside a bar.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.208
Guy had it coming.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.208
Did John Donovan?

13:09.291 --> 13:13.166
You had motive,
opportunity,
a serious beef.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.500
He work for you?

13:17.834 --> 13:20.333
Time to set
the record
straight.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.625
Clear your conscience.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.500
Your age, the DA
might work out a
deal.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.375
Time served.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.834
I'll talk to you.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.458
Or you can rot in prison
for all I care.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.000
It's always
something with them.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.875
What about you
and Donovan?

13:44.959 --> 13:46.083
We had a difference
of opinion.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.375
- We worked it out.
- I'll bet.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.792
Just because
I wasn't gonna strike

13:49.875 --> 13:51.583
don't mean
I killed the guy.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.458
No? Then who did?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.083
It was the coloreds.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.166
They blamed him
for Nate's death.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.959
You mean
the West Indian sandhogs?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.959
West Indians,
Afro-Americans.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.083
They can call themselves
whatever they want.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.333
They had it in for Donovan
in the worst way.

14:07.417 --> 14:08.542
And how would you know?

14:08.625 --> 14:11.417
Only place near the dig
to get refills

14:11.500 --> 14:14.792
was a coffee shop
served coloreds.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.750
So long as as you
didn't touch the silverware

14:16.834 --> 14:18.792
it was fine.

14:44.667 --> 14:45.792
Coffee, please.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.750
Be ready in a minute.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.041
Hey, it's good,
you found something.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.709
Cream or sugar?

14:57.792 --> 15:00.625
- Just black.
- Like this place used to be?

15:05.291 --> 15:07.917
The boys at the hog house
passed the hat.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.208
It ain't much.
It's the best we can do.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.959
Boy, Nate was right.
You give a man no quarter.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.417
Nate told you that?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.583
He told me
a lot of things.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.333
Did he now?

15:25.417 --> 15:26.583
I miss him, too, Alice.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.250
Not like I do.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.166
What about getting her
what's due?

15:31.250 --> 15:34.000
The union is working on
getting some kinda settlement.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.875
Me and Nate,
we paid our dues regular.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.750
Bad enough we get shut out
for the best jobs.

15:38.834 --> 15:41.291
- I hear you, Bishop.
- Do you?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.166
Maybe a White man gotta die
down in that hole

15:43.250 --> 15:45.959
for the union to sit up
and take notice. That it?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.166
I'm gonna go.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.166
Take care now.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.834
I will.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.625
You think Bishop
made good on that threat?

16:06.709 --> 16:08.542
Well, put it this way.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.625
I wasn't the only sandhog
who ever served time.

16:13.667 --> 16:14.875
Bishop had a record?

16:14.959 --> 16:17.625
[chuckles]
And a bad attitude.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.750
You were never paid
a settlement?

16:25.834 --> 16:30.041
Bertlemen wouldn't give a dime
for a Black man's life.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.166
Bishop was
pretty
upset about it.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.375
He was all bark,
no bite.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.500
You two keep
in touch?

16:37.583 --> 16:39.083
He passed..

16:39.166 --> 16:40.917
...twenty years ago.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.709
And no, we didn't.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.375
What about you, Alice?

16:44.458 --> 16:46.375
You were pretty
upset
with Donovan, too.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.417
I was upset that my husband
died
and I can't make the rent.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.083
Donovan helped me
in a time of need.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.041
Donovan come by regular
to give you money?

16:55.125 --> 16:59.667
To check on me.
To see how I was getting by.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.583
- 'Mm-hmm.'
- He ever talk about work?

17:02.667 --> 17:04.667
Anybody who might've
had in for him?

17:04.750 --> 17:06.625
No.

17:06.709 --> 17:10.208
Mostly, we...just
talk
about Nate.

17:12.166 --> 17:15.792
Now, you like talking
to him, hmm? Donovan?

17:15.875 --> 17:18.917
He was the first man
to make me laugh again.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.166
Got to be I looked
forward to seein' him

17:21.250 --> 17:24.125
on his way home
from a shift.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.458
Sounds like Donovan
was there quite a bit.

17:26.542 --> 17:29.500
Well, he didn't have
much to go home to.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.959
Meaning his wife?

17:31.041 --> 17:32.875
Couldn't get pregnant

17:32.959 --> 17:36.125
so she crawl up
inside a bottle.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.208
He didn't talk about it much
and I didn't ask.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.625
Back then,
people stuck it out..

17:43.792 --> 17:45.458
...even if it didn't
make sense.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.792
Just the times.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.709
He was still married and
White,
and I was neither.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.458
Did that stop you?

17:56.500 --> 18:01.250
One evenin', we were talking
longer than usual..

18:03.250 --> 18:06.959
...and finally we just
run out of things to say.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.500
Listen to that.

18:14.083 --> 18:17.166
Ah, nothing in the world
quite like it.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.083
Like what?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.458
The blues.

18:21.542 --> 18:24.166
Nate always said
you
liked your music.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.208
It ain't just music.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.125
No? Then what?

18:29.417 --> 18:32.625
Makes me feel like I'm not
alone listening to that.

18:35.709 --> 18:38.041
It's good to see you
smile again.

18:38.125 --> 18:41.375
Nate. He always used to say
a smile like that

18:41.458 --> 18:42.750
light up every tunnel
in the city.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.542
[laughing]
Come on, now.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.041
I always wondered
what he meant.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.333
Now I know.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.917
I ought to be
getting home now.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.709
Alright.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.291
Night.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.250
Goodnight.

19:26.500 --> 19:30.000
What'd you say
this song was called again?

19:30.083 --> 19:31.583
I never said it.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.709
You like it?

19:34.792 --> 19:36.667
Yeah.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.125
Yeah, I like it.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
I like everything about it.

20:05.166 --> 20:08.750
- Who is it?
- Satchmo.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.709
Hey.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.125
Hey what?

20:18.709 --> 20:20.458
You're not alone.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.667
(Miller)
'White, married man,
Black woman.'

20:52.959 --> 20:54.917
That could get you
in trouble today.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.000
I knew it couldn't
last
and it didn't.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.917
Must have been tough
to let that go.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.208
Anybody else know?

21:06.291 --> 21:07.792
Just the brother-in-law.

21:09.583 --> 21:11.500
Bobby McCallister?

21:34.625 --> 21:35.959
Hey, Lil.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.208
Wanna go for a ride?

21:41.333 --> 21:42.792
What are you doin' here?

21:42.875 --> 21:44.542
Oh, gee, Ray, it's nice to
see
you too, you know.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.542
Hey, I'd love to
go
for a spin.

21:49.291 --> 21:50.291
Sorry.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.750
Well, at least
I got a smile.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.625
Nice to see you, Ray.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.917
You know,
the way,
uh..

22:00.000 --> 22:03.250
...we left it last
time,
that was...nice.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.375
Look, I, uh..

22:10.458 --> 22:12.291
I gotta go.

22:12.375 --> 22:13.625
Something I did wrong?

22:20.458 --> 22:23.000
Ah, something
he did right.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.875
You didn't take the call.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.583
And I'm not taking a ride
with you either.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.667
Come on.
Just wanna
talk.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.000
So talk.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.500
Okay.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.083
I, uh, I got
hooked
into this deal

22:44.166 --> 22:48.291
with a bunch of street bikes
up in Bayonne, with my shop.

22:48.375 --> 22:49.792
Turned out to be hot.

22:51.291 --> 22:53.125
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.083
Call in a favor with
the Jersey state
police?

22:56.875 --> 22:59.792
I'm serious, Lil.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.041
These guys are, too.

23:02.667 --> 23:03.959
I'm sorry.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.583
Not this time.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.417
Okay.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.792
So, uh..

23:20.875 --> 23:22.542
So..?

23:25.041 --> 23:26.333
See you around, Ray.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.291
(Stillman)
'Come on, Bobby.'

23:40.375 --> 23:41.583
You knew that Donovan was
steppin' out on your sister.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.041
With the widow
of a Sandhog.

23:43.125 --> 23:46.166
- A black woman, no less.
- Why open that up?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.500
Bring shame to my family?

23:48.583 --> 23:50.667
Dishonor my sister like that?

23:50.750 --> 23:51.917
Oh, so this was
a family matter?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.333
That how you
dealt with it, Bobby?

23:53.417 --> 23:55.333
I know Mary
had her problems

23:55.417 --> 23:57.166
but Donovan was out of control.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.709
(Stillman)
'Out of control, how?'

24:00.583 --> 24:02.500
You gotta realize..

24:02.583 --> 24:04.500
...Donny had a lot bigger
problems on his plate.

24:04.583 --> 24:05.792
Like what, Bobby?

24:05.875 --> 24:08.458
He was going ahead
with the walkout..

24:08.542 --> 24:11.166
...but he had no idea
what he was walkin' into.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.500
Change of plans.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.875
- Things are gettin' stepped
up.
- Stepped up?

24:29.959 --> 24:31.500
We need to know
who's with us
now.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.250
It can't wait.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.375
Why all of a sudden?

24:34.458 --> 24:36.375
I think
Bertleman
found out..

24:36.458 --> 24:37.667
...about the walkout.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.375
What is it, Bobby?

24:42.458 --> 24:44.458
Heard Bertleman
hired goons.

24:44.542 --> 24:46.500
- Pinkertons.
- Who told you that?

24:46.583 --> 24:49.041
Guys are
talkin', Donny.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.333
Those Pinkerton thugs are
good for only one thing.

24:51.417 --> 24:52.500
Crackin' skulls.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.250
Guys don't need
to
hear that now.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.542
Means the boss is
brinin' in scabs

24:56.625 --> 24:58.542
and I got a
family to feed.

24:58.625 --> 24:59.834
What are you saying?

24:59.917 --> 25:02.375
You're out?

25:02.458 --> 25:04.959
Look, Bobby, things get rough. I
need to know I can count on you.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.417
Don't you see?

25:06.500 --> 25:08.834
Bertleman knows what you're
planning, he knows everything.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.583
What? How
does he know?

25:15.125 --> 25:16.458
Aw, no.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.000
- Oh.
- I'm sorry--

25:20.083 --> 25:21.959
Bobby?

25:22.041 --> 25:24.291
He threatened my job.

25:24.375 --> 25:25.959
Big Mac, too.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.125
I got kids. A family.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.417
So you told.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.750
I'm sorry, Donny.

25:45.542 --> 25:48.208
I never forgot the look
in Donny's eyes.

25:48.291 --> 25:49.709
You never
mentioned
it.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.875
Couldn't have help
your
big union career.

25:51.959 --> 25:54.083
You being
a stooge and all.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.542
It's something I'm not
proud of, believe me.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.959
He was like a
brother to me.

26:01.417 --> 26:04.417
You got any idea
what that's like?

26:04.500 --> 26:05.792
What, Bobby?

26:05.875 --> 26:08.500
Wondering if I was the one
that got him killed.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.125
Hey, you.

26:12.208 --> 26:14.375
Hey.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.083
What's going on?

26:17.166 --> 26:18.625
I got a meeting
over in Family
Court

26:18.709 --> 26:20.458
this afternoon, and
so I figured I'd
stop by

26:20.542 --> 26:22.125
see if you ate lunch.

26:22.208 --> 26:25.250
Oh, uh, yeah.
I kinda ate on the run.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.792
This case.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.709
Yeah. No,
I figured as much.

26:29.959 --> 26:32.166
I know you called
last night. I, um

26:32.250 --> 26:34.959
just got...caught
up
on the job.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.542
No, forget it.
I was just seeing

26:36.625 --> 26:38.166
if you wanted to grab dinner,
that's all.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.166
- It turned into a long
night.
- Don't worry about it.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.959
Some other time.
Some other time.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.750
Great.
Uh...maybe
tonight?

26:44.834 --> 26:46.208
Uh...we'll see.

26:46.291 --> 26:47.667
Um..

26:47.750 --> 26:49.250
Look, I better
run, alright?

26:51.583 --> 26:53.166
- Wait.
- What?

26:53.250 --> 26:55.000
Joseph, I..

26:55.083 --> 26:57.625
...I love you, too.

26:57.709 --> 27:00.166
Look, you don't have
to
say it just 'cause I
did.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.291
No, I wanna say it.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.250
Okay.
Alright.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.625
(Vera)
'Hey, kids!'

27:09.625 --> 27:11.041
- Hey, guys.
- Nick Vera.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.709
Joseph Shaw.

27:12.792 --> 27:13.875
I remember.

27:13.959 --> 27:15.250
Yeah.

27:16.875 --> 27:18.542
- Will Jeffries.
- Hey.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.208
So you're
still in town?

27:20.291 --> 27:23.083
Yeah, I'm working with the
DHS,
Court and Community Services.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.750
Oh, yeah, that's right,
delinquent youth--

27:24.834 --> 27:26.959
At-risk
juveniles,
yeah.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.333
- It's good work.
- Yeah.

27:28.417 --> 27:29.709
I-I think so.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.333
We better go.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.959
Why can't I meet a nice
girl
at a halfway house?

27:44.041 --> 27:45.792
Save it.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.542
I didn't know the guy
stuck around Philly.

27:47.625 --> 27:48.875
Well, now you do.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.417
Anything new
on Bertleman?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.083
McCallister's
story
checks out.

27:52.166 --> 27:53.333
Turns out
Bertleman was going

27:53.417 --> 27:55.750
to squash the strike
by hiring Pinkertons.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.083
Goons for hire.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.917
Specialize in bashing skulls.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.083
Might explain
the blunt-force trauma.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.917
Real interesting guy,
your old man.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.917
Not the most ethical,
but...interesting.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.917
He was a businessman. Sometimes
you gotta play hardball.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.959
Yeah? the Pinkertons were
pretty handy with a bat.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.250
He ever tell you about them?

28:19.333 --> 28:20.500
Heard about that

28:20.583 --> 28:22.583
but he didn't need them
to deal with Donovan.

28:22.667 --> 28:23.917
That right?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.083
Already had him
over a barrel.

28:26.166 --> 28:27.458
What do you mean?

28:27.542 --> 28:29.667
- Donovan was for sale?
- No.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.583
Let's just say
Donovan put himself

28:31.667 --> 28:33.500
in an untenable position.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.792
Yeah.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.041
'That's somethin',
ain't it?'

28:50.125 --> 28:51.959
You wanted to see me?

28:52.041 --> 28:53.625
I know what
you're
plannin', son.

28:53.709 --> 28:55.667
I'm here to tell you
it ain't gonna
happen.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.667
Ain't up to you,
Mr. Bertleman.

28:57.750 --> 29:00.208
Either you drop this
whole strike nonsense

29:00.291 --> 29:04.291
or your life's about to get
a whole lot bumpier. Got me?

29:04.375 --> 29:05.959
The only way you're
gonna stop this strike

29:06.041 --> 29:08.333
is across the table
hearing our demands.

29:08.417 --> 29:10.041
I don't think
you're hearin' me.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.166
We lost a good man
down in the hole.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.709
Nate Stallworth, you
might recall the name?

29:15.792 --> 29:17.125
I can't be threatened

29:17.208 --> 29:18.750
and I ain't for sale.

29:18.834 --> 29:20.625
No.

29:20.709 --> 29:22.291
Kinda figured that already, son.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.000
And if I get hurt,
that's just gonna put

29:24.083 --> 29:25.667
more of a fire
in the boys' bellies.

29:25.750 --> 29:29.542
You're right. But..

29:29.625 --> 29:30.834
...if another poor colored woman

29:30.917 --> 29:33.917
disappears on her way
home from work..

29:34.000 --> 29:35.500
'...well.'

29:35.583 --> 29:37.875
Ain't nobody really
miss her but you.

29:37.959 --> 29:39.000
You son of a bitch.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.834
It's my job to know
what's goin' on.

29:41.917 --> 29:45.083
What'd you say your friend's
name was again?

29:45.166 --> 29:47.667
'So you think about
that real hard.'

29:47.750 --> 29:50.542
You leave her alone.

29:50.625 --> 29:53.625
Now get your shovel
and get back to work.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.000
One thing I learned from my
daddy about being the boss

30:09.083 --> 30:10.542
most times it ain't what you do

30:10.625 --> 30:14.000
it's what people think
you're capable of.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.375
But Alice lived.

30:15.458 --> 30:16.750
He never laid a hand on her.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.375
Heard she left town.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.875
That right? When?

30:20.959 --> 30:23.000
Around the time
Donovan disappeared.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.875
(Will)
'Alice Stallworth
left Philadelphia'

30:33.959 --> 30:36.291
On April 28 of 1948.

30:37.542 --> 30:39.250
The same day
Donovan went missing.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.709
Right. Move to Chester, PA.

30:41.792 --> 30:42.750
What's in Chester?

30:42.834 --> 30:44.083
I thought maybe
a relative

30:44.166 --> 30:46.000
but we couldn't
locate anyone.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.500
Found this instead.

30:47.583 --> 30:51.041
Hospital record
from
November, 1948.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.208
Alice was sick?

30:52.291 --> 30:54.250
Not sick,
pregnant.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.333
She gave birth to
a nine-pound baby boy.

30:57.417 --> 30:58.667
'Nate had been
dead 11 months.'

30:58.750 --> 31:00.875
No way he could
have been the father.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.792
So Alice was pregnant
when she left town.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.166
Mm-hmm.

31:06.250 --> 31:07.959
With Donovan's baby.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.041
We know you left
Philadelphia, Alice.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.959
The same day
Donovan disappeared.

31:18.041 --> 31:21.417
Like I said before,
things got complicated--

31:21.500 --> 31:23.208
Well, they were
already
complicated.

31:23.291 --> 31:25.667
Him married,
you a widow.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.041
Black, white.

31:28.500 --> 31:33.125
I know all the reasons why it
was wrong back then, thank you.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.166
But then you found
yourself pregnant.

31:39.583 --> 31:43.375
It was foolishness
from the jump.

31:43.458 --> 31:45.125
I should've known better.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.417
(Rush)
'"Donovan."'

31:54.291 --> 31:57.000
'You gave your
son his name.'

32:01.333 --> 32:03.291
I wanted to remember him..

32:04.750 --> 32:06.959
...to remember his words.

32:07.917 --> 32:09.458
"You're not alone."

32:12.583 --> 32:16.125
Tell me what happened the night
he disappeared, Alice.

32:16.208 --> 32:19.542
I should have
known
it wouldn't last.

32:20.792 --> 32:24.875
Something that
special...never
does.

32:36.375 --> 32:37.792
Will you relax, baby?

32:37.875 --> 32:40.667
You're gonna wear
out the floor.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.709
That the one Big Mac gave you?

32:51.792 --> 32:53.709
When I made foreman.

32:53.792 --> 32:55.542
Oh, that means
something.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.458
He chose you to
lead those men.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.625
Sometimes you gotta
make touch choices

33:00.709 --> 33:02.583
choices you don't wanna make.

33:02.667 --> 33:03.917
Come close.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.166
Got something
special
to tell you.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.250
What's wrong, baby?

33:10.333 --> 33:12.542
You're here, but
you ain't here.

33:15.959 --> 33:20.375
- This has to end, you and me.
- What?

33:20.458 --> 33:23.834
You knew this
was gonna happen.

33:23.917 --> 33:26.125
What's really
going on, Donny?

33:26.208 --> 33:27.583
You know what the boys would say
if they found out?

33:27.667 --> 33:29.458
Since when do you
care about that?

33:29.542 --> 33:31.250
I'm a married man, Alice.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.000
Do you love her?

33:34.166 --> 33:36.500
Even if I left my wife,
which I can't..

33:36.583 --> 33:37.667
...you know it could
never work.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.166
That's not
what
I asked you.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.875
Oh, come on, Alice.

33:40.959 --> 33:42.041
Us?

33:42.125 --> 33:43.375
Out there?

33:45.667 --> 33:46.917
Forget it.

33:50.125 --> 33:52.750
Do you love me?

33:55.417 --> 33:57.500
No, I don't.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.583
Go to New York, someplace
you can start over.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.709
- I can send you money.
- Get out.

34:10.959 --> 34:12.250
'Alice..'

34:17.458 --> 34:19.542
...I'm so sorry.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.291
Not like I am.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.250
I never listened
to that song again.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.000
(Rush)
'You ever tell
your son about him?'

35:14.709 --> 35:16.208
It was just me.

35:17.333 --> 35:19.625
I was all he ever knew.

35:20.792 --> 35:23.959
Donovan's lighter,
the one with the cross.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.458
Big Mac gave it to him?

35:31.166 --> 35:33.291
Alice.

35:33.375 --> 35:35.458
Donovan was trying
to protect you.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.041
Protect me?

35:39.125 --> 35:40.875
'He was about to
take on some guys'

35:40.959 --> 35:43.709
'that played rough.'

35:43.792 --> 35:46.333
'Didn't want you
to get hurt.'

35:46.417 --> 35:48.709
He broke it off so you'd leave.

35:51.500 --> 35:55.417
Maybe he was just a man
afraid of the times.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.542
Or maybe he just loved you.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.667
Built to last forever,
those things.

36:20.333 --> 36:24.667
You know, once they even found
one inside the belly of a fish.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.166
'They pulled it out'

36:27.250 --> 36:29.625
and it lit right up..

36:29.709 --> 36:31.208
...very first time.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.542
It still works for me.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.709
Oh, nothin'
lasts forever, right?

36:40.500 --> 36:43.041
Except the statute
of limitations on murder.

36:47.333 --> 36:49.959
This wasn't a wedding present
from your father, was it,
Bobby?

36:51.792 --> 36:54.667
Big Mac gave it to Donovan
when he made him foreman.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.000
Not you.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.083
Belongs to me.

37:03.166 --> 37:05.875
The only way you could have
that
lighter is if you saw Donovan

37:05.959 --> 37:08.291
the night he disappeared.

37:08.375 --> 37:10.542
I was a sandhog, too, you know?

37:10.625 --> 37:11.875
20 in the hole.

37:11.959 --> 37:15.500
But you got passed
over
by your own father.

37:15.583 --> 37:18.625
He made Donovan foreman.

37:18.709 --> 37:19.834
(Bobby)
'I was his son.'

37:21.375 --> 37:22.667
His blood.

37:24.583 --> 37:25.834
The good one.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.834
You'd think he'd
respect you more.

37:30.041 --> 37:33.291
He treated me like a mope
with a muck stick.

37:33.375 --> 37:35.625
Like I couldn't do
anything more.

37:35.709 --> 37:37.333
And Donovan could do no wrong.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.166
Donovan the natural.

37:40.667 --> 37:41.834
Donovan the leader.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.917
Nothing you did
was ever good enough.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.000
Damned if I was gonna sit back

37:48.083 --> 37:51.000
and watch him
become the big hero.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.917
(Stillman)
'Instead it was
you, Bobby.'

37:53.000 --> 37:55.834
With Donovan gone,
you became president

37:55.917 --> 37:57.709
of Local 37.

37:57.792 --> 38:01.041
Achieved what he never
got a chance to do.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.792
I did what I had to do.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.792
You got rid of him.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.083
Finally.

38:10.291 --> 38:12.125
But you know the worst part?

38:16.500 --> 38:19.458
They went and turned him
into a damned saint.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.917
(Bobby)
Wanna let you know
right away, Donny.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.208
Heard there were
scabs down here.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.500
Is that right?

38:30.583 --> 38:31.709
Aw, look at this.

38:33.625 --> 38:36.041
Idiots were in the dynamite.

38:36.125 --> 38:37.709
Lucky they didn't blow
a head off.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.792
Better check the rest
of the supplies.

38:42.875 --> 38:44.375
I'll check over at the shaft.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.959
Alright. Well,
watch your step.

38:47.041 --> 38:49.917
They probably left
the misfires in the
muck.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.750
Bobby, I'm glad
you're with us.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.250
Rough as this is gonna get.

38:56.333 --> 38:59.083
Couldn't live with myself

38:59.166 --> 39:01.917
letting you go it alone.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.583
You know, in the long run

39:03.667 --> 39:05.083
it's gonna be better
for all of us.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.792
All because of you.

39:18.625 --> 39:19.917
What is this?

39:25.834 --> 39:27.875
- 'Donovan?'
- Yeah?

39:27.959 --> 39:29.291
You got a light?

39:29.375 --> 39:30.625
Yeah.

39:32.417 --> 39:33.667
Here.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.625
Thanks.

39:58.041 --> 39:59.291
Bobby?

40:03.500 --> 40:06.750
Always gotta be the hero.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.709
What are you talking about?

40:09.709 --> 40:10.917
Bobby?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.375
What're you doing?

40:13.458 --> 40:15.709
Not this time.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.917
(Donovan)
'Bobby!'

40:43.000 --> 40:44.417
'Bobby!'

40:44.500 --> 40:45.792
'Help me!'

40:47.458 --> 40:49.166
'Bobby.'

40:49.250 --> 40:50.625
[coughing]
'Bobby.'

41:01.125 --> 41:02.375
Alice..

41:06.959 --> 41:08.458
...you're not alone.

41:17.291 --> 41:19.250
Alice.
