41:36.768 --> 41:38.933
pretty much
worked on himself.

41:38.968 --> 41:42.167
And I-- I think he--
he cared very much about it.

41:42.202 --> 41:45.104
♪

41:46.745 --> 41:49.009
However,
that project was put on hold.

41:49.044 --> 41:51.814
And when Scott heard
that people were bringing

41:51.849 --> 41:53.882
Bubble Man over into
the United States

41:53.917 --> 41:55.851
and selling them for an obscene
amount of money,

41:55.886 --> 41:56.984
that burned him up.

41:59.219 --> 42:01.857
<i>Most expensive one here</i>
<i>right now is this guy here.</i>

42:01.892 --> 42:04.057
<i>And he's not old.</i>
<i>He's from 1992.</i>

42:04.092 --> 42:05.289
<i>He's called</i>
<i>the Bubble Gum Man.</i>

42:05.324 --> 42:06.598
<i>He's a prototype.</i>

42:07.167 --> 42:11.295
Scott McWhinnie was watching,
um, some news reel

42:11.330 --> 42:15.871
of a Pez convention,
and he saw the Bubble Man.

42:15.906 --> 42:17.972
Some girl had
one for sale.

42:18.007 --> 42:19.941
<i> There's only about</i>
<i>20 known in the whole world.</i>

42:19.976 --> 42:21.745
<i>It was something they designed</i>

42:21.780 --> 42:23.681
<i>that they didn't have to</i>
<i>pay licensing for.</i>

42:23.716 --> 42:25.342
<i>Manufactured a few,</i>
<i>and looked at it and said,</i>

42:25.377 --> 42:27.212
<i>"what were we thinking</i>
<i>when we made this?"</i>

42:27.247 --> 42:29.214
<i>-And that was the end of that.</i>
<i>-It's butt ugly.</i>

42:29.249 --> 42:31.249
-<i> That's right.</i>

42:32.956 --> 42:35.220
And Scott McWhinnie
had a fit.

42:35.255 --> 42:36.760
<i> And right now</i>
<i>his asking price</i>

42:36.795 --> 42:38.190
<i>is $1200.</i>

42:38.225 --> 42:40.632
<i>Wow, $1200 for a Pez?</i>

42:40.667 --> 42:41.732
<i>That's amazing.</i>

42:49.775 --> 42:52.974
At this point, when Scott
became aware of the-- the abuse

42:53.009 --> 42:56.912
that was going,
the best way of killing that

42:56.947 --> 43:00.685
was to take those dispensers
and put them into the direct

43:00.720 --> 43:03.248
marketing program, and sell
it to all the collectors

43:03.283 --> 43:05.316
at a reasonable price.

43:05.918 --> 43:07.692
Okay,
this is Bubble Man.

43:07.727 --> 43:09.254
It's worth nothing.

43:09.289 --> 43:11.289
Everybody shouted,
"Bubble Man! Bubble Man!"

43:11.324 --> 43:13.159
These are absolutely rare.
They will not produce it.

43:13.194 --> 43:14.798
And then it--
then they produced it.

43:15.233 --> 43:18.736
Maybe actually on purpose
to-- to-- to--

43:18.771 --> 43:20.100
to damage the collector scene.

43:20.469 --> 43:23.972
The reason that anybody
was willing to pay 1200

43:24.007 --> 43:26.073
to begin with was because,
at the time,

43:26.108 --> 43:28.108
they thought that
there were less than ten.

43:28.143 --> 43:29.681
I gotta tell you,

43:29.716 --> 43:31.210
when we put Bubble Man
out there,

43:31.245 --> 43:33.179
it was insane
the amount of orders we got.

43:33.581 --> 43:35.951
People want 'em, you know,
for a $1.99.

43:35.986 --> 43:38.085
You got
a $1200 dispenser.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.120
So, it was like--

43:40.155 --> 43:42.452
They've sold more
Bubble Boy than any--

43:42.487 --> 43:45.092
probably any
damn dispenser ever,

43:45.127 --> 43:47.963
and it came out
of Scott being so mad

43:47.998 --> 43:49.833
that
he couldn't see straight,

43:49.868 --> 43:53.738
and ordering
the product to stomp on us.

43:54.873 --> 43:56.235
You deal with the devil.

43:57.909 --> 44:00.437
And in all honesty,
Scott McWhinnie

44:00.472 --> 44:02.406
was my arch-nemesis.

44:03.244 --> 44:04.441
Oh, I hated his guts.

44:05.010 --> 44:09.886
And that's when I decided
to become the Pez Outlaw.

44:13.023 --> 44:16.321
I needed a vessel.
A person.

44:18.226 --> 44:20.292
I needed to build him.

44:20.327 --> 44:23.933
So that I can draw him in
when I need him.

44:23.968 --> 44:27.772
I definitely viewed the whole
thing as an adventure.

44:27.807 --> 44:31.039
The money,
the travel, the quest.

44:31.674 --> 44:35.912
My goal from that point on
was for accumulation.

44:35.947 --> 44:39.410
I needed the product
so I could beat Scott.

44:39.445 --> 44:43.315
Every sale I could take away
from Scott McWhinnie

44:43.350 --> 44:45.218
was a nail in his coffin.

44:47.189 --> 44:50.058
As the Pez Outlaw,
ain't nothing stops me.

44:50.093 --> 44:51.895
I mean,
for good or ill.

44:54.196 --> 44:55.800
I will win.

44:56.435 --> 44:59.034
I will win.
In the end.

45:03.469 --> 45:06.041
At that point,
we were going to Europe

45:06.076 --> 45:08.846
about every three
or four weeks.

45:08.881 --> 45:12.278
And going to shows
in between that.

45:12.313 --> 45:14.379
Sometimes
even landing at shows

45:14.414 --> 45:16.249
and going directly to them.

45:22.422 --> 45:24.323
We had so much cash

45:24.358 --> 45:27.095
a-- after some of these
conventions that,

45:27.130 --> 45:29.526
you know, you-- you did
feel like a rock star.

45:29.561 --> 45:33.068
I had so much money
that I was absolutely drunk.

45:33.103 --> 45:35.367
<i>And ta-da,</i>
<i>we have a basement.</i>

45:36.876 --> 45:39.074
But I mean,
we bought a ton of things.

45:39.109 --> 45:41.043
We bought a new house.

45:41.078 --> 45:43.342
<i>Well, guess what?</i>
<i>Here's my house in the ditch.</i>

45:43.777 --> 45:45.949
My mom really was able

45:45.984 --> 45:48.182
to have the freedom with them
coming into a little more money

45:48.217 --> 45:50.789
to really pursue
what she wanted to do.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.327
She went to schooling
to become

46:01.362 --> 46:03.362
a therapeutic
horseback riding instructor.

46:06.598 --> 46:09.137
Steve had become
<i>nouveau riche </i> at this point.

46:09.172 --> 46:12.041
His Pez market was booming.

46:12.076 --> 46:15.044
He was making tons of money,
which he never had before.

46:15.079 --> 46:16.441
Hey, that's
how I was doing things.

46:16.476 --> 46:18.179
I just-- talk to my bank.

46:18.214 --> 46:19.378
Do this, do that.

46:19.847 --> 46:21.578
He was so generous
with his money,

46:21.613 --> 46:23.954
he paid his family
and all his helpers well.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.418
I benefitted,
'cause I got to go to college

46:26.453 --> 46:28.222
without having to pay
for any of it.

46:28.791 --> 46:31.093
It was magic.
The whole time was magic.

46:31.656 --> 46:32.930
I won the lottery.

46:36.496 --> 46:39.629
Pez Outlaw was
so dominant in the marketplace

46:39.664 --> 46:42.137
that Scott McWhinnie,
the Pezident...

46:43.569 --> 46:45.008
He was losing.

46:45.043 --> 46:47.274
They advertised nothing.

46:47.876 --> 46:52.015
I had two full-page ads
in one publication,

46:52.050 --> 46:54.886
a full-page ad
in another publication...

46:54.921 --> 46:56.349
every month.

46:56.384 --> 46:58.417
He was blatantly
advertising these things.

46:58.886 --> 47:01.189
There's the easiest way
to find out.

47:01.224 --> 47:02.861
Steve was his own worst enemy.

47:03.697 --> 47:05.655
You know, put a billboard up,
here I am, guys.

47:05.690 --> 47:08.163
Come after me.
So, it's like--

47:08.198 --> 47:10.132
Well, you gotta remember,
at the end of the day,

47:10.167 --> 47:11.430
Pez is a brand.

47:11.465 --> 47:13.234
It's a registered brand.

47:13.269 --> 47:15.104
You go over there
on vacation, you bring back,

47:15.139 --> 47:16.908
you know,
a dozen, yourself.

47:16.943 --> 47:18.470
You can sell them online.
Nobody cares about that.

47:18.972 --> 47:20.505
When you start selling
thousands of 'em,

47:21.140 --> 47:23.145
and you're running
full-page ads...

47:23.647 --> 47:25.279
now you become a business.

47:25.314 --> 47:27.380
Scott took it
very seriously,

47:27.415 --> 47:30.185
"I'm gonna protect my product,
I'm gonna protect my brand.

47:30.220 --> 47:31.615
They're not gonna get
away with that any longer.

47:32.959 --> 47:34.354
♪

47:48.667 --> 47:50.667
After I couldn't
go with him anymore,

47:50.702 --> 47:55.980
um, I wasn't scared for him,
but I definitely was surprised,

47:56.015 --> 48:00.578
uh, that, you know,
he was able to-- to go alone.

48:03.682 --> 48:05.253
It was very nerve-wracking

48:05.288 --> 48:06.551
headin' off on my own.

48:22.734 --> 48:27.341
I think his mental health,
uh, state of mind,

48:27.376 --> 48:29.640
ex-drug persona, has to--

48:29.675 --> 48:32.379
it-- it can't not
play into paranoias.

48:36.352 --> 48:38.484
I learned
to protect my space.

48:44.327 --> 48:48.296
Getting off the
highway, taking back roads.

48:49.530 --> 48:51.167
Totally paranoid.

48:51.202 --> 48:52.630
I saw people
following me all the time.

48:53.666 --> 48:56.700
If I thought there was somebody
behind me, man, I'd ditch 'em.

49:04.314 --> 49:06.743
He had things
to be paranoid about.

49:06.778 --> 49:11.484
So, I would imagine that
he didn't know who to trust.

49:13.554 --> 49:15.620
Coming
from the Midwest,

49:15.655 --> 49:21.428
I had never seen officials
with machine guns.

49:23.069 --> 49:26.532
So, every border crossing
was a threat.

49:28.536 --> 49:30.734
Not just the people
with machine guns...

49:32.705 --> 49:35.541
...but the biggest nightmare
would be losing the load.

49:37.413 --> 49:38.742
That mattered.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.583
Every bag
out on to the blacktop.

49:45.352 --> 49:48.455
Every bag open.
Every bag dumped.

49:51.130 --> 49:53.130
Could I have possibly
gotten arrested?

49:53.165 --> 49:55.099
Yes.

49:55.134 --> 49:58.333
Would traps have been laid?
Yes.

50:00.271 --> 50:02.700
Sometimes, all he really wanted
was a bribe.

50:04.275 --> 50:06.704
I learned, if something
happens of that nature...

50:09.544 --> 50:11.148
Hand out some money,
you're done.

50:17.618 --> 50:21.521
Being that close to illegal,
maybe illegal.

50:21.556 --> 50:23.358
Of course you're paranoid.

50:27.859 --> 50:29.397
Scott never,
ever went to Europe

50:29.432 --> 50:30.794
to go chase down Steve.

50:30.829 --> 50:32.466
So, there--
there's none of this,

50:32.501 --> 50:34.171
you know, Scott
in a dark suit, you know,

50:34.206 --> 50:35.667
trying-- you know,
hiding behind corners.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.240
You know,
"I got you, Glew."

50:37.275 --> 50:38.571
You know?

50:38.606 --> 50:40.177
There wasn't
any of that drama.

50:40.212 --> 50:41.343
None of that ever existed.

50:42.676 --> 50:44.511
Would Scott McWhinnie
have tried

50:44.546 --> 50:46.249
to have people follow me?

50:46.284 --> 50:47.811
Yeah, he would've done that.
In a heartbeat.

50:49.749 --> 50:52.156
But if they were following me,
I did shake 'em.

51:18.184 --> 51:19.348
Steve Glew
was standing here.

51:21.649 --> 51:24.386
This was the place-- the place
Steve Glew was waiting for me.

51:25.088 --> 51:27.785
I just decided
to go visit Johann.

51:27.820 --> 51:29.490
I don't know
how I had his address,

51:29.525 --> 51:31.855
where I got it,
I have no idea, but I did.

51:31.890 --> 51:33.560
He came to me
without appointment.

51:33.595 --> 51:35.463
He just was standing
in front of my door.

51:35.498 --> 51:38.499
All of a sudden,
a guy pulls up on a, uh...

51:39.304 --> 51:40.897
mo-- motorbike.

51:40.932 --> 51:43.207
And I said, "You are lucky,
I am Johann Patek."

51:43.242 --> 51:44.571
And he said,
"Oh, I am Steve Glew

51:44.606 --> 51:46.705
from America
and I want to buy Pez."

51:46.740 --> 51:48.311
I just wanted to buy Pez.

51:48.846 --> 51:50.676
My answer was,
"Oh, yes, let's do."

51:50.711 --> 51:53.382
Let's do some deals
and I will show you something.

51:55.683 --> 51:57.452
I ask him to wait outside,

51:57.487 --> 52:00.455
and then I went in
and brought him some Pez.

52:00.957 --> 52:02.622
I had to sit on the curb

52:02.657 --> 52:05.757
outside this house he owned.

52:05.792 --> 52:07.726
While he went in
and got the product.

52:13.404 --> 52:15.206
Johann Patek. Yes.

52:16.309 --> 52:20.310
I do not know very much
about him that I would tell.

52:23.744 --> 52:25.249
It's all very basic here.

52:30.949 --> 52:33.422
Johann
is a collector in Austria.

52:33.457 --> 52:34.918
You know,
is this off the record?

52:34.953 --> 52:37.327
-Oh, okay.

52:42.565 --> 52:44.598
"What's in there?"
I don't tell you.

52:45.997 --> 52:47.436
I will tell you later.

52:48.802 --> 52:50.637
There's not much
to tell there.

52:50.672 --> 52:54.542
I mean, he's basically
just been a competitor of mine.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.579
And now, something
dangerous will appear.

52:58.614 --> 52:59.976
Let me see. Uh.

53:00.011 --> 53:03.386
Hi, guys. Hands up,
or I shoot you.

53:04.587 --> 53:07.225
It's a genuine Pez shooter.

53:07.594 --> 53:09.755
Now, Zorro. Oho.

53:10.824 --> 53:12.362
I am fighting for the poor.

53:12.397 --> 53:14.364
I am taking
the money from the rich.

53:14.399 --> 53:15.893
I am Zorro and I--

53:15.928 --> 53:17.730
so everybody
could recognize me,

53:17.765 --> 53:19.864
I have Zorro
written on my stem.

53:19.899 --> 53:22.372
Otherwise, somebody would say,
"I am a bank robber."

53:23.408 --> 53:24.869
He knows everybody.

53:25.304 --> 53:27.278
But, yeah, he's a--

53:30.415 --> 53:32.580
Um...

53:32.615 --> 53:34.912
He was in the right
place at the right time.

53:34.947 --> 53:39.257
Steve happened in and kind of
got in that territory.

53:39.959 --> 53:43.294
Um, and I don't know
if they're friends.

53:52.833 --> 53:54.437
Can we go up there and film?

53:54.472 --> 53:55.999
-No.
-No?

53:56.434 --> 53:58.639
-Okay, well, why not?
-No.

53:58.674 --> 54:01.873
Because this will--
in-- affect my business.

54:01.908 --> 54:03.347
Oh, I have to...

54:03.982 --> 54:06.515
...be silent
because I'm on a tape.

54:07.452 --> 54:08.682
I have no business.

54:08.717 --> 54:10.552
I never was
a businessman.

54:10.587 --> 54:14.688
I always wanted to be
part of the collectors game.

54:16.527 --> 54:17.988
He just
didn't want me to see.

54:19.530 --> 54:22.630
If people knew
how much he actually had,

54:22.665 --> 54:24.665
like, if I had opened
my mouth to the world

54:24.700 --> 54:26.502
that he had one bazillion...

54:27.835 --> 54:29.703
uh, the value
would have plummeted.

54:29.738 --> 54:32.508
Then, all of a sudden,
he wasn't interested anymore.

54:32.543 --> 54:34.070
Because he thought
he-- he could get it

54:34.105 --> 54:35.874
for an apple and an egg.

54:35.909 --> 54:40.483
But this was not so,
and so we parted our ways.

54:42.718 --> 54:44.718
He did not even know
what he was doing.

54:44.753 --> 54:46.687
I mean,
every dedicated collector

54:46.722 --> 54:49.118
is crazy a little bit
in his mind.

54:49.153 --> 54:51.494
Because otherwise
he would not be a collector.

54:51.529 --> 54:53.463
Collecting is, um,

54:53.498 --> 54:55.630
more or less a-- a disease.

55:11.813 --> 55:14.418
I think
my symptoms of anxiety,

55:14.453 --> 55:17.553
depression,
the highs, the lows,

55:17.588 --> 55:21.458
where you-- you-- the minute
you've-- you get high,

55:21.493 --> 55:22.756
the immediate thought...

55:23.325 --> 55:24.956
is what you know is coming.

55:25.827 --> 55:26.859
The low.

55:27.328 --> 55:28.993
So, you don't even
get to enjoy it.

55:51.721 --> 55:53.083
In my brain,

55:53.118 --> 55:55.184
I decided that
what was going on--

55:55.219 --> 55:56.988
well,
I just made something up.

56:01.467 --> 56:03.401
I have a very good...

56:04.063 --> 56:05.634
imagination, and...

56:06.069 --> 56:08.967
my heart is in creation.

56:09.002 --> 56:10.067
Hah!

56:11.136 --> 56:12.410
It's actually straight.

56:53.079 --> 56:55.112
By that time,
I had my master's in business.

56:55.147 --> 56:57.213
And I'd always envisioned,
you know,

56:57.248 --> 56:59.754
coming and working
for my dad, uh, anyways.

56:59.789 --> 57:01.624
He had the momentum,

57:01.659 --> 57:04.627
he had the pockets,
he had the mechanism in place.

57:07.731 --> 57:09.159
We had six employees,

57:09.194 --> 57:10.732
Josh was on the team.

57:12.131 --> 57:15.132
And I continued
my adventures as Pez Outlaw.

57:15.934 --> 57:19.675
I enjoyed messing
with Scott McWhinnie.

57:19.710 --> 57:21.644
He'd go
into boardrooms in Europe,

57:21.679 --> 57:24.746
screaming and yelling
and calling everybody names.

57:24.781 --> 57:27.276
Here he is,
some president

57:27.311 --> 57:30.048
of an international
corporation.

57:30.083 --> 57:31.819
-I am Pez USA! I am--
-And yet,

57:31.854 --> 57:33.755
I'm the number one thing
on his mind?

57:33.790 --> 57:35.691
Oh, my God,
I think I love you.

57:36.193 --> 57:39.629
We could've, um, sued him.
Brought him to court.

57:39.664 --> 57:41.730
The time, the money,
the frustration,

57:41.765 --> 57:43.666
to sue this guy.

57:43.701 --> 57:46.130
I have other ways I could
do it for a lot less money.

57:51.236 --> 57:55.205
I doubt literally
that people were following me.

58:03.919 --> 58:05.655
Yeah, the Shadow.

58:05.690 --> 58:07.250
The Shadow was following him.

58:15.260 --> 58:16.567
That's fun.

58:16.602 --> 58:17.667
That's fun.

58:18.967 --> 58:21.264
It ain't paranoid
if it turns out to be true.

58:32.376 --> 58:35.113
Scott would call
his counterparts over in Europe

58:35.148 --> 58:37.588
and discuss
these illegal dispensers

58:37.623 --> 58:39.887
that Steve was importing
and selling,

58:39.922 --> 58:43.319
and about having a stop put
to it, and the Europeans agreed

58:43.354 --> 58:46.663
to hire a private investigator
to put an end to it.

58:46.698 --> 58:48.797
I don't know who that was,
'cause they're private.

58:50.768 --> 58:52.196
Did they find out anything?

58:53.065 --> 58:55.001
It-- it seemed
like there was pieces

58:55.036 --> 58:58.004
of the puzzle that
were hard to put together.

58:58.039 --> 59:00.270
I mean, I have
my own personal theories...

59:01.240 --> 59:02.877
that...

59:02.912 --> 59:04.681
you know, I think
that maybe there was

59:04.716 --> 59:06.650
some people with-- inside
the company at the time

59:06.685 --> 59:08.146
that were doing things
they shouldn't have been doing.

59:08.648 --> 59:10.313
Steve has told us that...

59:10.848 --> 59:12.920
Gunther Leitner was actually

59:12.955 --> 59:14.790
selling things
under the table to him.

59:14.825 --> 59:15.989
No.

59:16.391 --> 59:18.255
I mean,
my experience with Gunther,

59:18.290 --> 59:19.861
he was always
an upstanding man.

59:19.896 --> 59:21.390
Upstanding businessman.

59:21.425 --> 59:23.865
Gunther was well-known
in the Pez organization

59:23.900 --> 59:25.262
because he was in
charge of the factories.

59:25.697 --> 59:28.771
You know, he was the--
the top guy, so...

59:28.806 --> 59:31.334
that-- that would be
beneath him, to do that.

so if somebody came in at night
or whatever, we can see them.

1:02:58.510 --> 1:03:01.181
It was definitely
a cat and mouse game

myself and Scott and other

1:03:11.963 --> 1:03:13.160
But he was passionate
about it.

1:03:13.862 --> 1:03:16.427
And-- and passionate

Very careful.

how much exposure

1:03:28.243 --> 1:03:30.111
I gave myself.

it's like visiting
this very special,

1:03:46.195 --> 1:03:47.656
wonderful place.

1:03:47.691 --> 1:03:50.934
And the door
to the factory offices

They were afraid of me
because I could get 'em fired.

1:04:35.644 --> 1:04:38.179
Um, they were afraid
to lose their jobs.

1:04:38.214 --> 1:04:39.378
Every one of 'em.

1:04:39.913 --> 1:04:42.216
Even knowing me
or saying they liked me

1:04:42.251 --> 1:04:44.482
could cost them
their job and their livelihood.

And, uh,
I don't say it with a brag.

1:05:02.772 --> 1:05:05.206
But I accept responsibility

1:05:05.241 --> 1:05:08.176
for both being shut down

Pez Outlaw,

1:07:39.725 --> 1:07:41.494
to be the man
she could love.

1:07:42.230 --> 1:07:44.596
She liked horses, so,
"Ooh, I gotta be a cowboy."

1:07:44.631 --> 1:07:47.203
So, I tried to be a cow--
You ain't gotta be a cowboy.

1:07:47.238 --> 1:07:49.733
Be useful. Be decent.

1:07:49.768 --> 1:07:51.405

took care of my family.

1:08:16.465 --> 1:08:18.729
But if I was gonna
continue with Pez,

1:08:18.764 --> 1:08:22.172
I realized that
I had to take action.

1:08:22.207 --> 1:08:23.899
We gotta find
other ways to do things.

1:08:24.334 --> 1:08:26.572
And that is what led to...

1:08:27.674 --> 1:08:29.278
the big decision.

1:08:35.715 --> 1:08:38.914
Trying to find...
There we go.

After buying
all this product for so long,

1:08:46.925 --> 1:08:50.794
i-- it finally occurred to me,
why don't I create my own?

1:08:50.829 --> 1:08:54.765
Um, I had a lot of good ideas,
just like Marcos.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.866
He's gonna hate me for this.

1:08:58.639 --> 1:09:00.408
Steve was very creative.

1:09:00.443 --> 1:09:01.871
He kept coming up with all
these different

1:09:01.906 --> 1:09:03.576
interesting
color variations like, um,

1:09:03.611 --> 1:09:06.678
crystal Pez
with see-through heads.

1:09:06.713 --> 1:09:09.747
If the order was,
you know, large quantities,

1:09:09.782 --> 1:09:13.751
anyone can get anything
directly from a factory.

1:09:13.786 --> 1:09:17.491
I decided to create
my own designs.

1:09:17.526 --> 1:09:21.363
I'd named 'em
the "Holiday Colors."

1:09:22.132 --> 1:09:24.927
The half million-dollar order
was my attempt to come out

1:09:24.962 --> 1:09:27.831
of the shadows,
and do business openly.

1:09:30.605 --> 1:09:32.242
I was trying to go legit.

1:09:32.277 --> 1:09:34.442
Yes, definitely
I was trying to go legit.

1:09:34.477 --> 1:09:36.609
And not have to talk
in code.

1:09:37.244 --> 1:09:41.251
And, uh, be able to say,
"Yes, this is my product."

1:09:47.655 --> 1:09:49.655
I mortgaged my house.

1:09:50.724 --> 1:09:52.427
I took out a line of credit.

1:09:52.462 --> 1:09:54.990
-That got me 250 of it.

1:09:55.025 --> 1:09:57.960
And then, believe it or not,
I had 250 cash.

1:09:58.662 --> 1:10:01.403
You know,
we went from bringing it back

1:10:01.438 --> 1:10:03.339
in, uh, duffle bags,

1:10:03.374 --> 1:10:06.408
to importing it through
a broker in Grand Rapids.

1:10:06.443 --> 1:10:09.510
And we were spending
huge amounts of money.

1:10:14.649 --> 1:10:16.847
They created
all my product...

1:10:17.416 --> 1:10:20.785
in the name that
it was going to, like, Taiwan.

1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:23.491
And Taiwan packaging.

1:10:24.593 --> 1:10:26.989
Rerouted it to me.

1:10:27.860 --> 1:10:30.630
Legally. On paper, legally.

1:10:41.940 --> 1:10:44.578
I laid out
the whole business plan, and...

1:10:45.213 --> 1:10:48.010
I could afford to pay
just under five bucks

1:10:48.045 --> 1:10:50.716
per to have them made.

1:10:51.618 --> 1:10:55.523
And then sell 'em for 25
and be on a good profit margin.

1:10:57.923 --> 1:11:00.528
And I'd been assured that

1:11:00.563 --> 1:11:03.058
this was going to be
exclusive to me.

1:11:04.831 --> 1:11:08.030
And I have faxes
of those assurances.

1:11:13.873 --> 1:11:15.609
We were set.

1:11:15.644 --> 1:11:18.876
Half a million dollars
was gonna turn into...

1:11:18.911 --> 1:11:22.517
a minimum
of 2.5 million dollars.

1:11:22.552 --> 1:11:25.047
And then Christmas time
rolls around,

1:11:25.082 --> 1:11:26.950
and I was just so excited.

1:11:30.461 --> 1:11:31.757
<i>♪ What is Christmas? ♪</i>

1:11:31.792 --> 1:11:33.528
<i>♪ Christmas is for living ♪</i>

1:11:33.563 --> 1:11:35.090
<i>♪ What is Christmas? ♪</i>

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:37.532
<i>♪ Christmas is for love ♪</i>

1:11:37.567 --> 1:11:40.667
<i>♪ Christmas</i>
<i>is for taking dreams ♪</i>

1:11:40.702 --> 1:11:43.637
<i>♪ And making</i>
<i>dreams come true... ♪</i>

1:11:43.672 --> 1:11:46.376
Oh, my God.
Are you kiddin' me?

1:11:46.411 --> 1:11:49.643
<i>♪ ...everyone,</i>
<i>especially for you ♪</i>

1:11:49.678 --> 1:11:52.910
Everything I wanted
was in front of me.

1:12:08.466 --> 1:12:10.763
This is the stuff
people dream of.

1:12:10.798 --> 1:12:17.440
<i>♪ Christmas is for everyone,</i>
<i>especially for you ♪</i>

1:12:18.641 --> 1:12:20.102
The best thing in the world.

1:12:20.137 --> 1:12:22.610
And Scott McWhinnie,
I'm not done yet.

1:12:40.124 --> 1:12:42.157
We started selling
it at conventions,

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:45.061
I started
selling it at toy shows.

1:12:45.096 --> 1:12:47.470
Everybody wanted his colors.

1:12:47.505 --> 1:12:49.604
You know,
he had five different stems

1:12:49.639 --> 1:12:51.936
of a yellow snowman
and of the red snowman.

1:12:52.405 --> 1:12:54.675
You could only buy them
from Steve.

1:12:54.710 --> 1:12:57.612
It was so different
than what Pez was putting out.

1:12:57.647 --> 1:12:59.713
So, this is Pez's version
of the skull.

1:12:59.748 --> 1:13:01.913
Right?
So, this is his variation.

1:13:01.948 --> 1:13:04.080
You know, he did the black face
with the yellow eyes.

1:13:04.115 --> 1:13:05.587
It just popped.
It looked cool.

1:13:06.323 --> 1:13:09.118
Steve Glew had so many
color variations of things,

1:13:09.153 --> 1:13:12.561
that I was in shock when I saw
those all out at one table.

1:13:12.596 --> 1:13:14.530
They were
selling like a madman.

1:13:14.565 --> 1:13:17.225
And it was more
than I could dream of.

1:13:17.260 --> 1:13:20.668
To have my own product line
that I was proud of.

1:13:20.703 --> 1:13:23.132
And I was,
I was extremely proud of it.

1:13:23.167 --> 1:13:26.905
That was the year
that I did a million bucks.

1:13:27.274 --> 1:13:28.643
It was magic.

1:13:31.274 --> 1:13:32.944
Going legit had worked,

1:13:32.979 --> 1:13:36.519
but it was the briefest
moment ever because,

1:13:36.554 --> 1:13:38.785
oh, man,
did the shit hit the fan.

1:13:44.595 --> 1:13:46.023
Steve and David Welch

1:13:46.058 --> 1:13:50.225
and I were walking
from our rooms upstairs

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:52.095
down to the convention floor.

1:13:53.164 --> 1:13:55.802
And we walked
through the door,

1:13:55.837 --> 1:13:59.740
and the first thing we see
is this huge display.

1:14:03.944 --> 1:14:06.978
I had a job to do,
and I executed the job.

1:14:07.013 --> 1:14:11.114
And the job
was to help stop this.

1:14:24.701 --> 1:14:27.768
This is what Pez did
with the Misfit.

1:14:27.803 --> 1:14:29.638
This is how
they packaged it.

1:14:29.673 --> 1:14:32.234
To them, it was misfit,
it was ugly.

1:14:32.269 --> 1:14:35.303
The ones that Steve had done
were on Pez cards.

1:14:35.338 --> 1:14:37.041
They were made
at the factory.

1:14:37.076 --> 1:14:39.714
They were on the--
a stripe candy card.

1:14:39.749 --> 1:14:42.178
But then when we walked
into the ballroom that day,

1:14:42.213 --> 1:14:44.114
they were
on a completely different card,

1:14:44.149 --> 1:14:47.689
and they were actually labeled
on that card as Misfits.

1:14:49.022 --> 1:14:50.956
Scott came up
with the name Misfits

1:14:50.991 --> 1:14:53.222
'cause they didn't fit into
the rest of the assortment.

1:14:53.891 --> 1:14:55.994
The Misfits
were manufactured

1:14:56.029 --> 1:14:58.964
as a way to put
him out of business.

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:02.671
Where he was selling them for,
say, 20, 25 dollars,

1:15:02.706 --> 1:15:04.805
we're selling
them now for $1.99.

1:15:05.307 --> 1:15:09.205
He sold for less
than I paid to have it made.

1:15:11.176 --> 1:15:12.978
So, basically...

1:15:13.547 --> 1:15:15.013
pulled the gas
right out of him.

1:15:15.515 --> 1:15:17.114
Scott used the marketplace.

1:15:17.149 --> 1:15:20.051
He used the market
to-- to kill him.

1:15:23.353 --> 1:15:26.156
The Pez company decided
to put him out of business.

1:15:26.191 --> 1:15:27.993
Steve and David
turned around

1:15:28.028 --> 1:15:29.324
and they went back
to their room,

1:15:29.359 --> 1:15:30.897
and they never came back
that day.

1:15:41.778 --> 1:15:43.173
It was horrible.

1:15:43.208 --> 1:15:45.373
It was just horrible.
They hurt him.

1:15:45.408 --> 1:15:48.783
They hurt him financially,
really bad.

1:15:53.251 --> 1:15:55.053
Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:55.088 --> 1:15:57.154
A little--
a little satisfaction.

1:15:59.059 --> 1:16:01.763
The man
was broken that day.

1:16:04.933 --> 1:16:06.801
I dropped my prices,

1:16:06.836 --> 1:16:09.804
pushed it out into the market
as cheap as I had to.

1:16:09.839 --> 1:16:11.201
It didn't work.

1:16:14.041 --> 1:16:15.139
Worthless.

1:17:12.396 --> 1:17:14.165
I didn't realize
how devastating it was

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:15.397
to him,
though, initially.

1:17:15.832 --> 1:17:17.839
This was right
around the time my wife

1:17:17.874 --> 1:17:20.039
and I got married, and Steve
was supposed to drive up

1:17:20.074 --> 1:17:22.470
from Michigan for our--
for our wedding.

1:17:22.505 --> 1:17:25.946
And, uh, he just was a no-show,
and I didn't know why.

1:17:30.051 --> 1:17:33.250
We lost contact after that,
and Steve stopped calling.

1:17:33.285 --> 1:17:36.088
I think he-- I think
he stopped taking phone calls,

1:17:36.123 --> 1:17:38.288
too, because of what--
of what happened to him.

1:17:42.525 --> 1:17:45.768
That's when he went into his--
his period of seclusion.

1:17:47.332 --> 1:17:48.903
Where he just, like,
dropped off of the,

1:17:48.938 --> 1:17:50.399
uh, off of the map.

1:18:05.284 --> 1:18:07.482
You know, he just
sort of went off the radar.

1:18:07.517 --> 1:18:10.287
Which is exactly
what the plan was.

1:18:34.214 --> 1:18:35.378
I lost all my money

1:18:35.413 --> 1:18:37.787
and went
$250,000 in debt.

1:18:39.252 --> 1:18:41.417
You know, you fight for--
to pay your bills.

1:18:42.153 --> 1:18:45.894
You damn near lose your house
so many times it's tiresome.

1:18:54.070 --> 1:18:57.939
Josh had to slowly let go
of all four of the employees,

1:18:57.974 --> 1:18:59.402
including my son-in-law.

1:18:59.437 --> 1:19:01.107
And his last job...

1:19:02.143 --> 1:19:03.472
was he fired himself.

1:19:26.035 --> 1:19:28.497
Yeah, I went through
some pretty bad years.

1:19:28.532 --> 1:19:30.334
Financially and mentally.

1:19:32.239 --> 1:19:33.909
But I think that...

1:19:34.611 --> 1:19:37.506
the crash was
important to find me.

1:19:43.349 --> 1:19:46.251
I had a decade
of what I call a primal scream.

1:19:47.155 --> 1:19:48.583
Scott McWhinnie decided...

1:19:49.285 --> 1:19:51.993
that he finally
had the way to kill me.

1:19:52.428 --> 1:19:54.996
And he was right.
He did.

1:19:57.264 --> 1:19:59.264
Okay.

1:20:02.267 --> 1:20:05.501
After the crash,
the story was all I had left.

1:20:06.003 --> 1:20:07.943
And that's when
I wrote my blog,

1:20:07.978 --> 1:20:09.373
<i>Pez Outlaw Diary.</i>

1:20:10.574 --> 1:20:12.376
You don't just
create a product.

1:20:12.411 --> 1:20:13.476
You create a story.

1:20:15.645 --> 1:20:18.019
When Steve
started writing his blogs...

1:20:18.588 --> 1:20:21.484
nobody knew
any of that about him.

1:20:23.191 --> 1:20:26.489
Steve feels
that this is his legacy now.

1:20:26.524 --> 1:20:28.227
He wants people
to know what happened.

1:20:28.262 --> 1:20:30.064
He wants
the story to be out.

1:20:30.099 --> 1:20:32.495
It validates it.
It says, "Yes, this happened."

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:36.906
I think everyone
wants to be remembered in life.

1:20:36.941 --> 1:20:38.468
They wanna make their mark.

1:20:38.503 --> 1:20:40.470
And they wanna
get it right.

1:20:40.505 --> 1:20:42.043
At least once.

1:20:42.712 --> 1:20:46.113
Honest to God,
if it wasn't for Pez Outlaw,

1:20:46.148 --> 1:20:48.115
nobody would remember
Scott McWhinnie.

1:20:48.684 --> 1:20:50.986
He's a plot point
in my story.

1:20:52.385 --> 1:20:55.386
If I can get this character
of Pez Outlaw...

1:20:56.554 --> 1:20:58.257
deeply ingrained enough

1:20:58.292 --> 1:21:00.127
into the history
of Pez, then...

1:21:01.361 --> 1:21:02.690
that will be enough.

1:21:02.725 --> 1:21:04.197
It's a good story.

1:21:05.365 --> 1:21:07.035
It's a good story.

1:21:12.977 --> 1:21:15.637
It was 20 years
before I saw Steve again.

1:21:15.672 --> 1:21:18.343
And he swore he'd never go
to another convention.

1:21:23.988 --> 1:21:25.416
I said, "Steve,

1:21:25.451 --> 1:21:27.682
everybody wants to know
about you, Steve.

1:21:27.717 --> 1:21:30.322
Everybody wants to hear
your story."

1:21:33.690 --> 1:21:35.525
Nowadays,
I think that, you know,

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.725
with all the new collectors
coming into the hobby,

1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:40.068
they-- they don't know
of the backstory.

1:21:40.103 --> 1:21:42.730
They don't know-- they weren't
there when it happened, and...

1:21:42.765 --> 1:21:45.007
For a guy like
me who wants to collect

1:21:45.042 --> 1:21:48.142
everything Pez,
his history was--

1:21:48.177 --> 1:21:51.046
was part of the influence
of-- of even why I collected.

1:21:52.577 --> 1:21:54.181
Steve Glew
was a featured person

1:21:54.216 --> 1:21:55.677
at the convention,

1:21:55.712 --> 1:21:57.448
and he hadn't been
heard from for years.

1:21:57.483 --> 1:21:59.549
And I mean,
there was many, many,

1:21:59.584 --> 1:22:01.320
many people that
wanted his signature.

1:22:02.289 --> 1:22:05.753
He definitely
has a great cult following.

1:22:05.788 --> 1:22:07.722
He-- he was just this...

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:09.427
I don't know,
Pez God.

1:22:09.462 --> 1:22:10.967
I mean, how--
how else do you say it?

1:22:15.105 --> 1:22:18.568
I think everyone
wants someone just to say,

1:22:18.603 --> 1:22:20.306
"I see
what happened to you

1:22:20.341 --> 1:22:22.275
and it-- and it matters."

1:22:23.311 --> 1:22:25.014
It's-- it's a huge thing

1:22:25.049 --> 1:22:26.741
to find out
that you're not alone.

1:22:27.577 --> 1:22:30.349
Everybody
wants their story told.

1:22:30.384 --> 1:22:32.054
Everybody wants
to be remembered.

1:22:33.651 --> 1:22:35.222
The story of Pez Outlaw

1:22:35.257 --> 1:22:38.588
is an act out
of my mental issues.

1:22:39.023 --> 1:22:42.361
Learning to cope
with anxiety, depression...

1:22:43.331 --> 1:22:44.396
and...

1:22:45.232 --> 1:22:48.301
the voices in your head,
so to speak.

1:22:48.336 --> 1:22:50.666
And in some cases,
some of the things

1:22:50.701 --> 1:22:53.438
that you have
are actually tools.

1:22:53.473 --> 1:22:55.275
They are not burdens.

1:22:56.044 --> 1:22:59.312
Honestly,
I think his story is good,

1:22:59.347 --> 1:23:01.776
and it's fun,
but I think the human side

1:23:01.811 --> 1:23:05.516
of Pez Outlaw
is way more valuable.

1:23:08.158 --> 1:23:11.126
I can be who I am
and be miserable...

1:23:11.722 --> 1:23:13.524
or I can be who I am...

1:23:15.165 --> 1:23:17.033
and try
and find the good in it.

1:23:19.202 --> 1:23:21.466
And if you're lucky,
like me,

1:23:21.501 --> 1:23:23.237
you married your therapist.

1:23:43.688 --> 1:23:45.193
She's been
everything to me.

1:23:45.789 --> 1:23:47.096
Everything.

1:24:05.281 --> 1:24:07.248
I hope you have success.

1:24:07.283 --> 1:24:09.646
I wish-- I wish you-- because
you're very sympathetic man.

1:24:09.681 --> 1:24:12.319
But I think
you picked the wrong topic.

1:24:12.354 --> 1:24:13.452
That's my impression.

1:24:13.487 --> 1:24:14.816
Let's see...

1:24:14.851 --> 1:24:16.389
if you--
if you also have to take out

1:24:16.424 --> 1:24:17.852
a mortgage for your house.

1:24:17.887 --> 1:24:20.426
Then I-- I-- I--
I keep right.

1:24:20.928 --> 1:24:22.494
You picked the wrong person.
