<i>PRESIDENT REAGAN: Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:12.300 --> 00:14.268
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.302 --> 00:15.636
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.670 --> 00:18.372
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:18.406 --> 00:21.075
PRESIDENT GEORGE HW BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:21.109 --> 00:22.676
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.711 --> 00:24.378
PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.412 --> 00:27.080
REPORTER: <i>The USS Cole was attacked
while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.149 --> 00:29.083
<i>This was an act of terrorism.</i>

00:29.117 --> 00:31.485
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.954
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.989 --> 00:35.089

00:40.562 --> 00:42.196
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:42.230 --> 00:45.266
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.300 --> 00:47.768
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.803 --> 00:51.705
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

LOCKHART: <i>It's been 58 days

01:29.645 --> 01:31.812
in which 219 Americans lost

01:31.847 --> 01:34.282
their lives.
How can the CIA

01:34.316 --> 01:37.118
be expected to protect
this country if it can't even

01:37.152 --> 01:39.287
- protect itself?
ADAL: <i>- Her history of insubordination</i>

01:39.321 --> 01:42.256
and mental illness might
be more useful to us

01:42.291 --> 01:44.692
than a good performance in front
of the Select Committee.

01:44.726 --> 01:46.093
I won't do that.

01:46.128 --> 01:48.329
I won't throw Carrie
under the bus.

You mean for someone who got
in a bathtub

01:54.970 --> 01:56.170
and tried to slit her wrists?

01:56.204 --> 01:59.173

All right,

02:19.561 --> 02:22.129
<i>now, the headline is...</i>
<i>"CIA Officer Linked</i>

02:22.164 --> 02:23.230
<i>to Langley Bomber."</i>

02:23.265 --> 02:24.532
I assume you've seen this.

02:24.566 --> 02:26.667
We all know how we hate things
getting out into the press,

02:26.702 --> 02:28.736
unless of course
we put them out there ourselves.

02:28.770 --> 02:30.137
Carrie, you're making
a bad mistake.

02:30.172 --> 02:33.274
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

02:33.308 --> 02:34.909
Perhaps you'd care to comment
on the article

02:34.943 --> 02:36.777
in yesterday's paper.

02:36.812 --> 02:39.080
The case officer in question,

02:39.114 --> 02:41.382
she's been diagnosed as bipolar,

02:41.416 --> 02:43.517
a condition she concealed
from her superiors

02:43.552 --> 02:46.187
- for more than ten years.
LOCKHART: - Did she conceal from you

02:46.221 --> 02:49.023
the fact that she was sleeping
with Congressman Brody?

02:49.057 --> 02:51.759
I'm afraid she did, yes.

02:54.162 --> 02:57.498
(scoffing)

03:05.540 --> 03:06.740
Carrie.

03:06.808 --> 03:08.175
I need to talk to Saul. Saul!

03:08.243 --> 03:10.744
- He's not here, Carrie.
- Saul!

03:10.812 --> 03:13.380
He's not here.

03:13.448 --> 03:16.250
He left already. He had
some early morning meeting.

03:16.318 --> 03:19.253
- With whom?
- I don't know.

03:19.321 --> 03:21.255
- We could call him.
- Well, if I could call him,

03:21.323 --> 03:22.656
why would I come
all the way here?

03:22.724 --> 03:24.325
Are you okay?

03:24.392 --> 03:25.426
(scoffs)

03:26.328 --> 03:28.028
Well, tell Saul I came by.

03:28.096 --> 03:29.863
I'm sure he knows.

03:29.931 --> 03:31.732
What is going on with you two?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.367
Hey.

03:34.269 --> 03:36.003
Saul told me about the incident.

03:36.071 --> 03:38.172
- What incident?
- At the restaurant.

03:39.074 --> 03:41.141
Oh, that.

03:41.209 --> 03:43.444
- He said you were very upset.
- Well, yeah.

03:43.511 --> 03:46.647
I-I guess I was.

03:46.715 --> 03:49.049
But, you know, if-if I think
about an incident

03:49.117 --> 03:50.451
that's upsetting to <i>me,</i>

03:50.518 --> 03:52.720
no, I think it would have to be
when he sold me down the river

03:52.787 --> 03:55.389
in front of the fucking
Senate Select Committee.

03:55.457 --> 03:56.223
Now, that...

03:56.291 --> 03:59.226
that was upsetting.

03:59.294 --> 04:01.428
Be sure to tell him I came by.

04:01.496 --> 04:02.796
Carrie...

04:02.864 --> 04:04.999
Uh, he had his chance.

06:18.399 --> 06:19.733
Of the year?

06:19.767 --> 06:21.301
Of the month.

06:21.336 --> 06:23.971
Eight days.

06:33.414 --> 06:36.016
Our transactions expert arrived.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.551
How is she?

06:37.585 --> 06:40.187
A kid in a headscarf.

06:40.221 --> 06:42.523
And most of the banking division
vanished in the explosion.

06:42.557 --> 06:44.491
You asked for a specialist
with language skills.

06:44.526 --> 06:45.726
That's what you get.

06:47.629 --> 06:49.429
So, what do you got?

06:49.464 --> 06:50.797
Carrie.

06:50.832 --> 06:52.733
She called a reporter.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.570
Apparently, she thinks
it's important they,

06:56.604 --> 06:58.705
quote, "hear her side
of the story."

06:58.740 --> 07:00.741
She give any indication
what that is?

07:00.775 --> 07:03.043
Not yet, but you know
what she's gonna say.

07:03.077 --> 07:05.979
We knew Brody was a terrorist
all along.

07:06.014 --> 07:08.081
He wore a suicide vest
into a bunker

07:08.116 --> 07:09.483
with the vice president.

07:09.517 --> 07:11.218
She tried to warn us;
nobody would listen.

07:11.252 --> 07:13.387
So call the editor;
get him to shut it down.

07:13.421 --> 07:15.022
She's out for blood, Saul.

07:15.056 --> 07:16.957
We keep her away
from these guys,

07:16.991 --> 07:18.825
she just goes somewhere else.

07:18.860 --> 07:20.127
Look,

07:20.161 --> 07:21.428
we knew this might happen.

07:21.462 --> 07:22.930
We planned for it.

07:22.964 --> 07:26.567
I just wanted you to know
I'm gonna stop her.

07:36.911 --> 07:38.845
Okay, I'd like you
to acknowledge

07:38.880 --> 07:40.280
that I am recording this

07:40.315 --> 07:42.149
and that everything you
say is on the record.

07:42.183 --> 07:43.250
Yeah, I'm being recorded.

07:43.284 --> 07:44.351
I see the red light,

07:44.385 --> 07:45.786
and I want everything
on the record.

07:45.820 --> 07:46.987
I'm Nicole Hung, here with...

07:47.021 --> 07:48.088
Carrie Mathison.

07:48.122 --> 07:49.790
You've been with
the CIA 14 years.

07:49.824 --> 07:50.991
Yes.

07:51.025 --> 07:52.693
You told me you had a
falling out recently.

07:52.727 --> 07:53.760
No, what I said was

07:53.795 --> 07:55.395
I'm under attack.

07:55.430 --> 07:58.365
A week ago,
you published a story

07:58.399 --> 08:00.767
that an unnamed CIA officer
was in a romantic relationship

08:00.802 --> 08:01.969
with the Langley Bomber.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.437
And is that officer you?

08:03.471 --> 08:04.571
No, you're missing the point.

08:04.606 --> 08:06.340
No one at the CIA was

08:06.374 --> 08:07.808
in a relationship
with the Langley Bomber.

08:07.842 --> 08:10.043
Okay, wait,
according to my source...

08:10.078 --> 08:11.144
The CIA.

08:11.179 --> 08:13.347
I can't confirm that.

08:13.381 --> 08:15.849
Well, I don't know
what kind of conversation

08:15.883 --> 08:17.284
you expect to have here

08:17.318 --> 08:19.620
if you won't acknowledge
the fucking obvious.

08:19.654 --> 08:22.356
The CIA gave you that story
to set me up.

08:22.390 --> 08:23.624
For what?

08:25.960 --> 08:27.728
The big lie.

08:27.762 --> 08:29.529
Now, despite what they said,

08:29.564 --> 08:31.365
Nicholas Brody
is not responsible

08:31.399 --> 08:32.732
for the explosion at Langley.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.433
And you can prove this?

08:34.469 --> 08:35.769
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

08:35.803 --> 08:37.037
Did Saul Berenson know

08:37.071 --> 08:39.139
when he testified
before the Senate subcommittee?

08:39.173 --> 08:40.240
Of course he did.

08:40.275 --> 08:42.009
Everything he said was bullshit.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.809
Now, I'm not the one
who got it wrong.

08:43.845 --> 08:45.245
I'm the only one
who got it right,

08:45.280 --> 08:46.446
and for the longest time,

08:46.481 --> 08:49.349
I couldn't get anyone
at the CIA to believe me.

08:51.386 --> 08:53.620
Did you tell anyone
that I was coming here?

08:53.655 --> 08:54.888
Just my editor.

08:54.922 --> 08:56.290
Just your editor?

08:56.324 --> 08:57.924
Fucking Saul.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.393
OFFICER:
Carrie Mathison,

08:59.427 --> 09:00.861
DC Metro.

09:00.895 --> 09:02.296
You need to come with us.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.797
(scoffs)
What, three of you?

09:03.831 --> 09:04.898
You think that's enough?

09:04.932 --> 09:06.900
Standard procedure, ma'am.

09:06.934 --> 09:08.168
Yeah, for-for what?

09:08.202 --> 09:10.170
What sort of bullshit
charges did they make up?

09:10.204 --> 09:11.338
There's no charges, ma'am.

09:11.372 --> 09:13.373
We've got
a psychiatric detention order.

09:13.408 --> 09:15.442
You understand what that is?

09:16.844 --> 09:19.212
Yeah, I understand.

09:23.217 --> 09:25.285
Hey, that's not necessary.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.321
Is it?

09:28.690 --> 09:30.557
(laughs quietly)

09:30.591 --> 09:32.693
Now, you're entitled
to a full commitment hearing

09:32.727 --> 09:33.727
within 24 hours.

09:33.761 --> 09:34.961
This is complete bullshit!

09:34.996 --> 09:36.196
You know that, right?

09:36.230 --> 09:38.665
Ma'am, please.
(scoffs)

09:46.441 --> 09:50.243
So, you've been back home
now, what, almost a week?

09:50.278 --> 09:52.279
How's that going?

09:54.382 --> 09:56.216
Is it a challenge?

09:56.250 --> 09:59.386
Why would it be a challenge?

09:59.420 --> 10:01.254
I don't know.

10:01.289 --> 10:03.590
Reentry, being back
out in the world?

10:03.624 --> 10:05.559
I'm not back out
in the world though.

10:05.593 --> 10:06.693
I'm stuck at home.

10:06.728 --> 10:08.061
And why is that?

10:10.465 --> 10:14.968
Dana thinks that she's...
famous in a bad way.

10:15.002 --> 10:17.471
The word is "infamous."

10:17.505 --> 10:19.873
RICHARDSON: Is that what you
think, that you're infamous?

10:22.043 --> 10:24.644
Okay. No, I'm not.

10:24.679 --> 10:26.346
Well, which is it?

10:28.316 --> 10:31.418
Well, let's see.

10:31.452 --> 10:35.021
My dad blew up the CIA,
he killed 300 people,

10:35.056 --> 10:37.624
they call it the second 9/11,
and it was

10:37.658 --> 10:40.127
all anybody talked about
for a month and a half.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.429
What your dad did?

10:42.463 --> 10:44.097
Right.

10:44.132 --> 10:45.766
What about what you did?

10:45.800 --> 10:49.369
What I did? This?

10:49.404 --> 10:51.938
By comparison,
it's, like, nothing.

10:51.973 --> 10:54.875
I know what you mean by that,
but it's not nothing.

10:54.909 --> 10:57.778
It's why we're here,
the three of us.

10:59.647 --> 11:01.214
So, what about you?

11:01.249 --> 11:02.382
Me?

11:02.417 --> 11:04.384
Same question.
How are you doing?

11:04.419 --> 11:05.986
I'm fine.

11:06.020 --> 11:07.721
Okay.

11:07.755 --> 11:08.989
Really.

11:09.023 --> 11:10.757
I'm just glad that she's home.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.493
Good.

11:13.528 --> 11:15.328
(sighs)

11:15.363 --> 11:17.197
I mean, there have been
some adjustments,

11:17.231 --> 11:18.899
but we knew there would be.

11:18.933 --> 11:21.368
What kind of adjustments?

11:21.402 --> 11:24.738
She remodeled the bathroom...

11:24.772 --> 11:26.740
where I did it.

11:26.774 --> 11:29.843
I didn't.

11:29.877 --> 11:32.112
Yeah, you did.
You remodeled the whole thing.

11:32.146 --> 11:33.580
I didn't.

11:33.614 --> 11:36.383
I didn't remodel it.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.452
The blood wouldn't
come out of the grout,

11:38.486 --> 11:42.422
so I had to replace everything,
which I did myself with a book.

11:45.993 --> 11:47.961
We don't have
to talk about that.

11:47.995 --> 11:49.996
With you there.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.343
Hi. I need to make
an appointment

12:03.377 --> 12:06.112
for, um, Thursday
for Dr. Richardson.

12:06.147 --> 12:09.149
(people chattering)

12:21.929 --> 12:23.930
(whispers):
I miss you.

12:23.965 --> 12:26.500
(whispers):
I miss you, too.

12:27.568 --> 12:30.170
Dana, come on.

12:37.378 --> 12:39.379
(footsteps approaching)

12:45.086 --> 12:47.487
Carrie Mathison,
I'm Dr. Harlan.

12:47.522 --> 12:48.922
Harlan. I can read.

12:48.956 --> 12:50.924
I'll be with you tomorrow
at your commitment hearing.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.826
I'd like to explain
to you what that is.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.327
I know what
a commitment hearing is.

12:54.362 --> 12:56.530
I just can't believe they're
actually going through with it.

12:56.564 --> 12:57.998
I'm not sure what you mean.

12:58.032 --> 12:59.165
Well, I mean, I get it.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.400
Someone tries to tell the truth,

13:00.434 --> 13:01.735
you counter
by calling them crazy.

13:01.769 --> 13:05.038
I admire the move;
it's elegant, but it's...

13:05.072 --> 13:06.540
it's unnecessary.

13:06.574 --> 13:07.941
Tell them that.

13:07.975 --> 13:09.175
I'm standing down.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.677
You're standing down?

13:10.711 --> 13:15.048
I've learned my lesson, so can I
get out of here, please?

13:17.285 --> 13:19.352
Says here you stopped
taking your meds.

13:19.387 --> 13:21.187
Says where? What?
What? What is that?

13:21.222 --> 13:22.822
It's your medical history.

13:22.857 --> 13:24.024
According to whom?

13:24.058 --> 13:25.292
Your doctors.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.294
Really? 'Cause...

13:27.328 --> 13:29.930
no doctor of mine,
one that I am actually seeing,

13:29.964 --> 13:31.364
would write that.

13:31.399 --> 13:33.466
Did you stop taking your meds?

13:33.501 --> 13:35.502
(sighs)

13:37.605 --> 13:41.007
I didn't... I didn't <i>just</i> stop
taking my meds.

13:41.042 --> 13:42.642
I have a routine to compensate.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.377
A routine that I have worked out

13:44.412 --> 13:46.680
with my actual doctor,
not some CIA shill

13:46.714 --> 13:48.315
who's trying to shut me up.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.616
(sighs)

13:49.650 --> 13:52.519
I, um... I run
every day, six miles.

13:52.553 --> 13:53.820
Sometimes more.

13:53.854 --> 13:55.488
Singing helps. Go figure.

13:55.523 --> 13:57.891
And, um, and I meditate.

13:57.925 --> 13:59.192
(exhales)

13:59.226 --> 14:00.727
To stay calm.

14:00.761 --> 14:02.128
Are you... calm?

14:02.163 --> 14:03.430
Well, considering

14:03.464 --> 14:05.565
I'm chained to a gurney
in a hospital gown,

14:05.600 --> 14:06.833
I'd say I'm beyond calm.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.134
I'm fucking Zen!

14:08.169 --> 14:10.470
(scoffs)

14:10.504 --> 14:13.773
I just... I can't...

14:13.808 --> 14:15.875
I can't do the meds anymore.

14:15.910 --> 14:17.043
Why not?

14:17.078 --> 14:18.545
Because they dull my head.

14:18.579 --> 14:20.580
I miss things when I'm on them.

14:20.615 --> 14:23.416
Miss, not... as in "yearn for,"

14:23.451 --> 14:25.051
but miss as in "fail to see."

14:25.086 --> 14:27.220
- Fail to see what, for example?
- Well, for example,

14:27.254 --> 14:30.590
the explosion at Langley
that killed 219 people.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.158
And I see it already,

14:32.193 --> 14:34.494
the doubt on your face,
but I-I am CIA.

14:34.528 --> 14:35.528
You can verify it.

14:35.563 --> 14:37.397
Unless, of course,

14:37.431 --> 14:39.432
they expunged my records, which...
(scoffs)

14:42.203 --> 14:44.671
...come to think of it,
is a real possibility.

14:44.705 --> 14:45.705

14:48.309 --> 14:49.876
Look, my sister is a doctor.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.144
You can call her.

14:51.178 --> 14:53.713
She'll tell you
everything I've said is true.

15:06.861 --> 15:08.495
They said you were
looking for me?

15:08.529 --> 15:09.796
I didn't want to bother you.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.064
No bother.
What do you got?

15:11.098 --> 15:13.033
I managed to source
all the accounts on the laptop.

15:13.067 --> 15:14.567
There weren't that many.

15:14.602 --> 15:17.404
And the documents in
the briefcase, too.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.139
And?

15:19.173 --> 15:20.974
Nothing originates in Iran.

15:21.008 --> 15:23.243
Let me know when you find
something that does.

15:23.277 --> 15:25.245
Sir?

15:25.279 --> 15:27.414
I'm not sure what
you expect me to do.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.082
I've looked at all the accounts
like you asked.

15:29.116 --> 15:30.116
There's nothing there.

15:31.152 --> 15:32.919
You know what you're here for?

15:32.953 --> 15:35.522
To examine the bank records.

15:37.358 --> 15:39.059
You're following the money.

15:39.093 --> 15:41.695
From Hong Kong Lending
Bank to this guy.

15:41.729 --> 15:42.829
Here.

15:42.863 --> 15:45.331
Majid Javadi.

15:45.366 --> 15:47.934
The Iranian who funded
the attack on this agency

15:47.968 --> 15:49.536
that occurred on 12/12.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.137
I know.

15:51.172 --> 15:52.338
Good.

15:52.373 --> 15:54.240
So do that.

15:54.275 --> 15:55.975
And you know what else?

15:56.010 --> 15:57.243
While we're talking
about an event

15:57.278 --> 15:59.179
that left 200 Americans
dead on the ground,

15:59.213 --> 16:01.347
and what you're doing about it,
which is apparently nothing...

16:01.382 --> 16:03.383
(sighs)
Forgive me.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.054
You wearing that thing
on your head

16:08.089 --> 16:10.190
is one big "fuck you"
to the people

16:10.224 --> 16:11.658
who would've been
your coworkers,

16:11.692 --> 16:14.728
except they perished
in a blast right out there.

16:14.762 --> 16:17.230
So if you need to wear it,
if you really need to,

16:17.264 --> 16:18.598
which is your right,

16:18.632 --> 16:22.368
you better be the best analyst
we've ever seen,

16:22.403 --> 16:24.137

don't tell me there's nothing.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.439
Give me a plan.

16:26.474 --> 16:30.376
Give me a goddamn plan
or don't say anything.

16:30.411 --> 16:31.811

What do you want?

25:37.090 --> 25:39.258
I know both of you hate me
right now,

25:39.293 --> 25:40.726
but I'm on her side.

25:40.761 --> 25:42.495
- Oh, bullshit.
- I am.

25:42.529 --> 25:45.498
Doesn't change the fact
that the way she's carrying on,

25:45.532 --> 25:47.533
she's her own worst enemy.

25:47.567 --> 25:49.268
You need to reign her in;
she can't be running

25:49.303 --> 25:50.970
to a reporter
every time she gets upset.

25:51.004 --> 25:53.105
Is that what she did?

25:53.140 --> 25:55.174
What, she didn't even
mention it to you?

25:55.208 --> 25:57.043
- No.
- Well, what do you expect her to do?

25:57.077 --> 25:58.144
Not even fight back?

25:58.178 --> 25:59.211
She's not fighting back.

25:59.246 --> 26:00.846
She's making herself a target.

26:00.881 --> 26:02.548
Agency runs on secrecy.

26:02.582 --> 26:05.217
There are people who want her
indicted on criminal charges.

26:05.252 --> 26:06.919
So you're threatening us?

26:06.953 --> 26:08.521
I'm telling you the truth.

26:08.555 --> 26:10.389
Best thing you can do
for Carrie right now

26:10.424 --> 26:11.691
is convince her to stay inside.

26:11.725 --> 26:12.925
You mean the psych ward?

26:12.959 --> 26:14.827
I mean out of sight,
someplace she can level out.

26:14.861 --> 26:17.063
You know she's off
her meds, right?

26:19.933 --> 26:21.534
Unless you think
that's a good idea,

26:21.568 --> 26:23.436
you really have to help me.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.368
Good.

26:56.370 --> 26:58.104
What?

26:58.138 --> 27:00.639
You're smiling.

27:00.674 --> 27:02.708
So are you.

27:02.743 --> 27:04.410
(chuckles)

27:04.444 --> 27:07.246
Wonder why that is.

27:14.755 --> 27:16.989
You know they're
gonna find out soon

27:17.023 --> 27:19.058
that I'm missing.

27:19.092 --> 27:20.693
And your mother is just...

27:20.727 --> 27:22.294
Don't.

27:22.329 --> 27:24.363
Please.

27:24.398 --> 27:26.799
Just want it to be us.

27:32.072 --> 27:33.572
And appliances.

27:33.607 --> 27:35.074
(laughs)

27:35.108 --> 27:38.577
I just want it to be us
and appliances.

27:43.250 --> 27:46.752
'Cause we're not defective.

27:46.787 --> 27:49.422
You know?

27:49.456 --> 27:51.090
We're not.

27:51.124 --> 27:52.925
It's everything out there.

27:57.597 --> 28:01.867
Then I'd rather stay here
with all the other crazies.

28:04.571 --> 28:06.539
You're not crazy.

28:06.573 --> 28:09.108
So what if I am?

28:19.786 --> 28:21.454
(shutter clicks)

28:26.092 --> 28:28.260
You're so beautiful.

28:41.908 --> 28:44.176
(door closes, Dana gasps)

28:44.211 --> 28:45.611
Hey.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.914
Hey.

28:48.949 --> 28:50.950
(talking quietly)

28:57.424 --> 28:59.091
(clears throat)

29:01.795 --> 29:03.162
He says he's here

29:03.196 --> 29:05.297
as a character witness,
if you need him.

29:05.332 --> 29:07.600
I already told him I don't.

29:07.634 --> 29:09.468
If you make a fuss
and have him removed,

29:09.503 --> 29:11.971
I don't think it'll help
you with the magistrate.

29:12.005 --> 29:14.306
It's not bad to have
someone else on your side.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.776
Okay, fine.
Just leave him then.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.580
So what are my chances?

29:21.615 --> 29:24.450
We're asking that you be
released to your family.

29:24.484 --> 29:25.951
So as far as I'm concerned,

29:25.986 --> 29:27.987
they're excellent.

29:28.021 --> 29:30.789
How do you feel?

29:30.824 --> 29:32.591
I just want this to be over.

29:32.626 --> 29:33.792
Oh, good, they're here.

29:33.827 --> 29:34.927
Maggie, Dad, Hi.

29:34.961 --> 29:36.095
This is Dr. Harlan.

29:36.129 --> 29:37.429
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:37.464 --> 29:39.331
- Did you find everything?
- Yeah.

29:39.366 --> 29:41.233
Okay. I was wondering
where you were.

29:41.268 --> 29:43.502
What's this?

29:43.537 --> 29:46.138
We want to talk
about your medication.

29:47.874 --> 29:50.109
Obviously, you already have.

29:50.143 --> 29:52.077
- Carrie, listen...
- No, I've got a hearing

29:52.112 --> 29:53.279
in about three minutes.

29:53.313 --> 29:54.880
The whole point being
that I don't need

29:54.915 --> 29:56.215
anyone telling me what to do.

29:56.249 --> 29:58.484
- You said you would help.
- We are helping.

29:58.518 --> 30:00.019
No, not when you
pull this shit!

30:00.053 --> 30:01.387
We're concerned, okay?

30:01.421 --> 30:02.988
- About you getting yourself into trouble.
- Don't be.

30:03.023 --> 30:04.957
I mean, from what
you've been saying.

30:04.991 --> 30:06.692
I've been saying nothing!

30:06.726 --> 30:08.227
I've spent the last 24 hours

30:08.261 --> 30:10.062
- checked in here.
- No, before that.

30:14.901 --> 30:16.869
Oh, you mean the reporter.

30:16.903 --> 30:18.504
Yes.

30:18.538 --> 30:20.906
CARRIE:
You want to tell me

30:20.941 --> 30:22.474
how you even know about that?

30:24.344 --> 30:27.279
God... fucking Saul.

30:27.314 --> 30:29.882
- He's worried about you.
- Really?

30:29.916 --> 30:32.351
You're divulging
classified stuff.

30:32.385 --> 30:34.486
He told you that he was
worried about me,

30:34.521 --> 30:35.654
and you believed it,

30:35.689 --> 30:37.890
when he's the one
who put me in here.

30:37.924 --> 30:40.993
God, he's...
he's try...

30:41.027 --> 30:43.562
He's trying to crush me
when I am trying

30:43.597 --> 30:45.864
so hard to do what's...

30:45.899 --> 30:47.032
what's right.

30:47.067 --> 30:48.500
Fuck.

30:48.535 --> 30:51.103
No, he pretended to be
my friend, and he's not.

30:51.137 --> 30:53.105
You know what, really?

30:55.141 --> 30:57.876
No different than you.

30:59.112 --> 31:01.146
Hey...

31:01.181 --> 31:03.015
All rise.

31:03.049 --> 31:05.451
The Sixth Circuit,

31:05.485 --> 31:07.052
the Commonwealth of Virginia,

31:07.087 --> 31:10.756
the Honorable Special Justice
William Chesney.

31:13.860 --> 31:15.461
CHESNEY:
Matter of Carrie Mathison.

31:17.597 --> 31:19.231
Is that you?

31:25.839 --> 31:27.840
Your Honor...

31:27.874 --> 31:29.875
(panting softly)

31:31.878 --> 31:33.646
I'm sorry.

31:37.350 --> 31:38.751
Get off!

31:39.819 --> 31:42.154
(grunting)

31:42.188 --> 31:43.522
No!

31:43.556 --> 31:46.091
This is a fucking sham!

31:46.126 --> 31:47.393
NURSE:
Come on.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.801
SAUL: With all respect,
you've had a long history

31:55.835 --> 31:58.003
of questionable
transactions with Iran.

31:58.038 --> 32:01.540
Item four from the Office of
the Controller of the Currency,

32:01.574 --> 32:04.643
three years ago in October,
they issued a cease and desist

32:04.678 --> 32:06.578
ordering your client
to stop dealings

32:06.613 --> 32:09.782
with the Al Askari
Bank in Tehran.

32:09.816 --> 32:12.151
My client complied
with that order.

32:12.185 --> 32:15.487
You continued dealings
with their trading company.

32:19.893 --> 32:22.594
The order applied
only to the bank.

32:22.629 --> 32:23.896
That's your position?

32:23.930 --> 32:25.964
That's the language
in the paper.

32:25.999 --> 32:29.234
SAUL: So you proceeded
to accept wire transfers

32:29.269 --> 32:32.538
from an Iranian trading company
to the tune of $900 million

32:32.572 --> 32:33.806
over that time period.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.075
Systematically altered

32:36.109 --> 32:37.276
the transaction headers

32:37.310 --> 32:40.245
to conceal the true source
of the funds.

32:43.016 --> 32:45.217
We're not sure where you're
getting your information from.

32:45.251 --> 32:48.454
My client made every effort to
comply with federal regulations.

32:50.924 --> 32:52.658
We have an e-mail here
saying the opposite.

32:55.862 --> 32:59.198
An instruction to
Al Hazlawin Trading.

32:59.232 --> 33:02.067
"Delete all Iranian
customer names to avoid any sign

33:02.102 --> 33:05.237
of US legal breach."

33:10.210 --> 33:12.144
These legal breaches,

33:12.178 --> 33:15.047
those are violations
of the laws

33:15.081 --> 33:17.149
you just told me you
were complying with.

33:17.183 --> 33:19.585
I wouldn't know
what it refers to.

33:19.619 --> 33:22.654
How can you not know?
You sent the e-mail.

33:22.689 --> 33:26.091
Subject line is
"Do not reference Iran."

33:33.099 --> 33:35.234
We have the phony
wire transfers--

33:35.268 --> 33:36.401
thousands of them.

33:36.436 --> 33:38.737
We want the real ones
with the real names.

33:38.772 --> 33:40.105
Where did you get this?

33:40.140 --> 33:41.540
That's your question?

33:44.043 --> 33:46.712
Your client is funding attacks
by terrorists on this country,

33:46.746 --> 33:49.615
and all you want to know
is how did we find out?

33:49.649 --> 33:52.251
So who did you say
this is again?

33:52.285 --> 33:54.853
You know your bank?

33:54.888 --> 33:57.456
It's been trafficking
in human misery

33:57.490 --> 33:59.191
since the opium wars.

33:59.225 --> 34:01.160
That's not an aberration.

34:01.194 --> 34:02.661
It's not a mistake.

34:02.695 --> 34:04.530
That's your business plan.

34:04.564 --> 34:07.332
You move money for
embargoed governments

34:07.367 --> 34:08.634
or phony charities.

34:08.668 --> 34:10.536
Where it goes, you
don't want to know,

34:10.570 --> 34:13.105
as long as you get your fee.

34:13.139 --> 34:15.940
But we're telling you
where it went this time.

34:15.975 --> 34:18.777
Into an SUV full of C4
that blew up

34:18.812 --> 34:21.146
right outside this building
three months ago.

34:21.181 --> 34:25.016
You passed the blast
site on your way in.

34:25.051 --> 34:27.518
We know the funds moved
through your bank.

34:29.522 --> 34:32.056
We need to know
where they originated.

34:32.091 --> 34:33.891
You do?

34:33.927 --> 34:36.628
Yes.

34:39.599 --> 34:43.068
All respect, ma'am...

34:43.101 --> 34:46.405
in this country, that's not
the way we ask for help.

35:08.494 --> 35:10.729
Did you think for even a second

35:10.763 --> 35:12.264
how worried I would be?

35:12.298 --> 35:13.799
There was no need to worry.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.500
How do you figure that?

35:15.535 --> 35:17.970
He's not good for you.

35:18.004 --> 35:20.973
And that is based on what,
not knowing him at all?

35:21.007 --> 35:23.609
He's got problems, obviously.

35:23.643 --> 35:24.776
He's unstable.

35:24.811 --> 35:27.379
Is that your
professional diagnosis, Mom?

35:27.413 --> 35:30.082
He's... Dana, he's not
what you need right now.

35:30.116 --> 35:33.485
Maybe he's exactly
what I <i>do</i> need.

35:33.519 --> 35:35.554
Dana, every doctor at the
center, every pamphlet,

35:35.588 --> 35:37.155
every book that I've
read on getting well,

35:37.190 --> 35:39.157
they all say the same thing,

35:39.192 --> 35:40.392
you don't want to
start a relationship.

35:40.426 --> 35:43.028
What, with someone who actually
understands you?

35:43.062 --> 35:44.563
Is that what they say?

35:44.597 --> 35:46.698
Do you realize
how crazy that is?

35:46.733 --> 35:49.034
You think they know something,
the people in here.

35:49.068 --> 35:50.035
Well, they don't.

35:50.069 --> 35:52.638
They just yack and yack and yack

35:52.672 --> 35:55.307
until the people who are
paying for it feel better.

35:55.341 --> 35:56.909
Like everyone is getting well.

35:56.943 --> 35:59.177
I really don't understand.

35:59.212 --> 36:01.313
Yeah, that's right.

36:02.582 --> 36:04.516
Hey, glad you're all right.

36:04.550 --> 36:05.751
I'm not all right.

36:05.785 --> 36:06.752
Mom, it's okay.

36:06.786 --> 36:07.986
JESSICA:
Is it?

36:08.021 --> 36:09.621
When someone runs away
<i>to</i> the nuthouse?

36:09.656 --> 36:11.523
What does she want me to do?

36:11.557 --> 36:12.824
Do you want my attention?

36:12.859 --> 36:14.059
Is that it?

36:14.093 --> 36:17.029
Because you got it,
completely, believe me.

36:27.573 --> 36:29.007
What are you doing?

36:29.042 --> 36:30.709
I wasn't looking for attention.

36:30.743 --> 36:32.444
Dana, what are you doing?

36:32.478 --> 36:33.545
Showing you something.

36:33.579 --> 36:35.013
No, no!

36:35.048 --> 36:37.916
It wasn't a cry for help
what I did.

36:37.951 --> 36:39.551
I didn't want
anyone's attention.

36:39.585 --> 36:41.453
I wanted to kill myself.

36:41.487 --> 36:45.490
I wanted it all to be over,
and I wanted to die

36:45.525 --> 36:47.893
because I could not
stand it anymore!

36:47.927 --> 36:50.896
But now I can.

36:50.930 --> 36:55.033
Now I want to be alive.

36:55.068 --> 36:57.336
And the reason for that is Leo.

36:59.672 --> 37:03.108
I was happy last night
for the first time

37:03.142 --> 37:06.311
since I-I don't even know when.

37:06.346 --> 37:09.514
And I am not gonna
do this anymore.

37:09.549 --> 37:11.416
I am not gonna let
everybody tell me

37:11.451 --> 37:12.851
what I should be
fucking thinking

37:12.885 --> 37:14.953
all the time,
like I can't decide for myself,

37:14.988 --> 37:17.522
like something
is wrong with me.

37:19.258 --> 37:21.860
Because Leo is not crazy,

37:21.894 --> 37:23.095
and I am not crazy.

37:23.129 --> 37:26.531
And in case you're wondering,
neither are you.

37:26.566 --> 37:29.034
Dad was crazy.

37:29.068 --> 37:32.270
He was a lot of things.

37:32.305 --> 37:33.705
He was a psycho

37:33.740 --> 37:35.040
who did nothing but lie

37:35.074 --> 37:37.242
from the minute he set foot
in this house,

37:37.276 --> 37:39.711
and he ruined our lives.

37:39.746 --> 37:41.780
It's the truth.

37:41.814 --> 37:44.149
But I am okay now.

37:44.183 --> 37:46.351
I really am.
I can... I can tell.

37:46.386 --> 37:47.719
Because you know what?

37:47.754 --> 37:50.288
Right now, at this moment,

37:50.323 --> 37:53.058
I want to be alive.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.840
Any word from the bankers?

38:08.875 --> 38:10.275
Nothing.

38:10.309 --> 38:13.678
I did get calls from about
30 congressmen though.

38:13.713 --> 38:15.313
Telling you to back off.

38:15.348 --> 38:18.583
Remind me I'm supposed to be
catching terrorists,

38:18.618 --> 38:21.520
not bringing down the
international banking system.

38:21.554 --> 38:24.923
- Sit.
- No, I'll stand.

38:24.957 --> 38:28.026
I went to Carrie's
hearing today,

38:28.061 --> 38:30.362
and I saw her being hauled off,

38:30.396 --> 38:31.997
kicking and screaming.

38:32.031 --> 38:34.933
I heard she lost it.

38:34.967 --> 38:36.601
She didn't lose it.

38:36.636 --> 38:38.737
We did that to her.

38:38.771 --> 38:41.039
We did it.

38:41.074 --> 38:43.842
I would never bail on you
in the middle of something,

38:43.876 --> 38:47.112
but I want you to know
what's going on here

38:47.146 --> 38:49.481
is not okay with me.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.488
Peter...

38:56.522 --> 38:57.923
(sighs)

38:57.957 --> 38:59.858
It's been a rough week.

38:59.892 --> 39:00.892
I'm aware.

39:02.428 --> 39:05.530
But we're onto something.

39:05.565 --> 39:08.266
And if it leads
to where I think,

39:08.301 --> 39:10.202
it will all have been worth it.

39:11.737 --> 39:13.805
I don't know, Saul.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.740
Just have a little faith.

39:15.775 --> 39:18.610
The thing is, I don't.

39:18.644 --> 39:21.079
And when this is over, I'm out.

39:21.114 --> 39:22.914
We'll see when we get there.

39:22.949 --> 39:24.616
I'm telling you now.

39:34.293 --> 39:36.862
It was a mistake, Peter.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.697
What happened to that child.

39:38.731 --> 39:41.466
Yeah.

39:41.501 --> 39:43.268
It was my mistake.

39:43.302 --> 39:46.404
And I'll deal with it.

39:46.439 --> 39:49.908
But I don't know what the hell
we're doing, I really don't.

40:12.231 --> 40:14.232
(people chattering)

40:32.651 --> 40:34.652
I saw you at Langley today.

40:36.655 --> 40:38.423
Sorry, I don't remember.

40:38.457 --> 40:39.491
That's understandable.

40:39.525 --> 40:42.227
You were pretty busy
lying your ass off.

40:42.261 --> 40:43.361
What?

40:43.395 --> 40:45.497
You lost a colleague this week.

40:45.531 --> 40:46.531
That's right.

40:46.565 --> 40:48.032
He was gunned down,
his son, too.

40:48.067 --> 40:49.567
It was a horrible mistake.

40:49.602 --> 40:51.603
I hope it's not repeated.

40:54.139 --> 40:56.174
Tell me who you are.

41:02.214 --> 41:03.681
Who are you?

41:03.716 --> 41:05.316
It's aggravating, isn't it,

41:05.351 --> 41:07.418
when someone won't
answer your questions?

41:07.453 --> 41:09.921
Talk to my lawyer...

41:09.955 --> 41:11.756
I'm talking to you.

41:14.293 --> 41:16.027
And I'm telling you,
you have a choice.

41:16.061 --> 41:18.496
You can give us the
information we're asking for,

41:18.531 --> 41:20.431
or you can keep up
your stupid charade.

41:20.466 --> 41:21.766
But if you make the latter,

41:21.800 --> 41:23.801
I want you to know
I try very hard

41:23.836 --> 41:27.772
to be patient with
venal shitheads like you...

41:27.806 --> 41:30.041
but I can only do it so long.

41:32.077 --> 41:34.045
You have a good flight home.

42:04.143 --> 42:05.209
SAUL:
They're all here?

42:05.244 --> 42:07.211
- The records?
- Seem to be.

42:07.246 --> 42:08.446
So what'd they give us?

42:08.480 --> 42:09.747
Everything.

42:09.782 --> 42:12.717
HLBC basically ignored
the cease and desist order,

42:12.751 --> 42:14.052
just like we said.

42:14.086 --> 42:15.954
They stopped dealing
with Al Askari Bank,

42:15.988 --> 42:18.656
but they continued
with the trading company.

42:18.691 --> 42:21.292
In fact, the number of
transactions increased,

42:21.327 --> 42:22.627
especially toward the date

42:22.661 --> 42:23.761
of the explosion.

42:23.796 --> 42:25.096
Know who all was involved?

42:25.130 --> 42:26.464
We're getting there.

42:26.498 --> 42:28.266
On the receiving end,
we've already identified

42:28.300 --> 42:30.301
half a dozen
known associates of Abu Nazir.

42:30.336 --> 42:31.836
What about the source?

42:31.870 --> 42:34.839
We're still putting names
to the transactions,

42:34.873 --> 42:36.841
but it's all pointing to Iran.

42:36.875 --> 42:38.910
Not just the country.

42:38.944 --> 42:40.678
Inside the government.

42:48.153 --> 42:50.488
So why did they suddenly decide
to cooperate?

42:50.522 --> 42:53.191
I'm not sure we want to know.

42:53.225 --> 42:55.059
What is this?

42:55.094 --> 42:56.427
Something I noticed

42:56.462 --> 42:58.997
when I was reconciling
the accounts horizontally.

42:59.031 --> 43:00.665
All the Iranian funds

43:00.699 --> 43:02.800
had 20% stripped off
by our banker friends--

43:02.835 --> 43:05.169
a standard fee for
prohibited transactions.

43:05.204 --> 43:09.941
But... a quarter of
that disappeared.

43:09.975 --> 43:11.542
To where?

43:11.577 --> 43:13.177
I don't know yet.

43:13.212 --> 43:15.079
Just seems to have vanished.

43:15.114 --> 43:17.782
All I know is it was not
retained by their bank.

43:17.816 --> 43:18.950
Find it.

43:18.984 --> 43:20.685
- Find out where it went.
- I'm trying.

43:20.719 --> 43:22.186
Make it your
number one priority.

43:22.221 --> 43:25.089
That right there,
that's the key.

43:25.124 --> 43:26.624
Almost $45 million.

43:30.562 --> 43:31.996
Fara...

43:32.031 --> 43:33.865
Yes, sir?

43:35.868 --> 43:38.236
Keep it between us,
for the time being.

43:43.408 --> 43:45.409
(Carrie gasping)

43:47.579 --> 43:50.114
I don't know what
you think you're proving.

43:50.148 --> 43:53.584
All anyone's asking
is that you take your meds.

43:53.618 --> 43:55.419
I mean, you're not
leaving us any choice.

43:55.454 --> 43:56.887
Is that what you want?

43:58.357 --> 43:59.423
(grunts)

44:08.967 --> 44:11.302

(grunting quietly)

47:33.905 --> 47:36.740
Carrie.

47:36.775 --> 47:38.776
I am so sorry.

47:44.916 --> 47:47.284
(whispers):
Fuck...

47:47.319 --> 47:49.520
you, Saul.
