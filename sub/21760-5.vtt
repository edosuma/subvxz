Watch this!

01:28.080 --> 01:29.170
Whoa!

01:36.000 --> 01:38.880
You know, you really
should exercise your minds

01:38.880 --> 01:40.960
as well as your bodies.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.330
Easy turn.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.960
No, I've got it!

01:45.960 --> 01:47.710
This one's mine.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.040
Ugh!

01:51.040 --> 01:52.170
Ow!

01:53.790 --> 01:54.830
Aah!

01:55.830 --> 01:56.920
You okay, Rolly?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.790
Why yes, Cadpig.

01:58.790 --> 02:01.750
I've always dreamed
of being a throw rug.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.040
It's just too crowded in here.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.620
That's the problem.
Right, Lucky?

02:06.620 --> 02:08.000
Lucky?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.170
Oh.

02:16.710 --> 02:17.790
Cadpig,

02:17.790 --> 02:20.790
I think maybe
you've got something there.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.880
We need our own space.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.540
Come on.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.620
Maybe we can spot
a place from up there.

03:02.790 --> 03:05.040
Oh, that cramp!

03:11.120 --> 03:13.460
There's gotta be
some place out there.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.120
Whoaaaa!

03:18.120 --> 03:21.120
Whoaaaa!

03:24.790 --> 03:27.580
Aaaaaah!

03:33.290 --> 03:37.000
Ohh! It's a regular hay haven!

03:37.000 --> 03:40.750
You know, this place is
just what we're looking for.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.250
Our own hangout.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.540
Yeah!

03:47.540 --> 03:49.710
We can move in,
and we don't have to worry

03:49.710 --> 03:53.420
about nobody or nothin'
bothering us ever again.

04:05.960 --> 04:11.170
Man, this has got to be
the coolest pad on the farm.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.920
Yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.500
Everybody's gonna be jealous
when they find out

04:15.500 --> 04:18.790
we got our own
secret hangout.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.880
And that's exactly why
we have to keep it a secret.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.380
Nobody tell anyone.

04:24.380 --> 04:25.750
Got it?

04:25.750 --> 04:26.790
Both:
Got it!

04:26.790 --> 04:29.750
Hey, I hear you got
your own secret hangout.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.250
Hey, she bribed me with kibble.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.710
Well, I guess
it's all right
if Spot knows

04:35.710 --> 04:38.540
as long as it's a secret
from everyone else.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.380
It's a secret.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.750
Hey, where is
this secret hangout?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.750
Ooh, and what
are you gonna call it?

04:46.750 --> 04:49.380
And why is your stuff
all over the ground?

04:49.380 --> 04:50.420
Huh?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.750
Rolly:
What's going on here?

04:52.750 --> 04:54.330
I don't know,

04:54.330 --> 04:57.290
but there's only
one way to find out.

04:59.670 --> 05:00.920
All:
Pug!

05:00.920 --> 05:03.250
Quiet!

05:03.250 --> 05:05.290
I mean, quiet!

05:05.290 --> 05:07.000
Do you want
the enemy to hear?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.040
The ears have walls.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.830
There are spies everywhere!

05:10.830 --> 05:12.420
Everywhere!

05:12.420 --> 05:15.380
I think he's flashing back.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.500
I'll take care of this.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.750
Uh, two questions.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.250
Who's the enemy,

05:21.250 --> 05:23.670
and what the heck
are you talking about?

05:23.670 --> 05:25.170
The enemy?

05:25.170 --> 05:27.380
Why, the cats of course.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.210
The cats!

05:29.210 --> 05:30.960
And they're planning
the big one.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.580
The big one!

05:33.580 --> 05:35.830
Look, Lieutenant,
we don't mean to disturb

05:35.830 --> 05:37.830
your shell-shocked
delusions, but...

05:37.830 --> 05:40.040
This is our hangout.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.210
And by that, we mean
it is not yours!

05:43.210 --> 05:46.750
So, uh, get lost.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.830
Now you listen up,
you little pipsqueak.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.460
I have officially commandeered
this hangout of yours

05:55.460 --> 05:57.080
to be my Operations HQ.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.670
Lucky, Pug,

05:59.670 --> 06:01.620
I think we should
define the problem,

06:01.620 --> 06:04.170
propose solutions,
then choose an act.

06:04.170 --> 06:07.290
That will lead
to a resolution.

06:07.290 --> 06:11.790
The problem is
I seem to have
a pug on my collar.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.670
Now you listen to me, Pug.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.710
This hangout of ours

06:17.710 --> 06:19.120
isn't big enough
for the both of us,

06:19.120 --> 06:21.380
so what are you
gonna do about it?

06:32.080 --> 06:34.790
Well, that's a resolution.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.580
Shut up, Cadpig.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.540
Who does he think he is?
This is totally unfair.

06:41.540 --> 06:44.210
Yeah. Pug stinks.

06:44.210 --> 06:49.250
Well, this hay loft does have
a certain shabby-chic motif.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.920
It just needs
a little work.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.250
You know what?

06:53.250 --> 06:55.170
You guys are right.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.540
All:
We are?

06:56.540 --> 06:58.330
Yeah. Suppose we use

06:58.330 --> 07:00.540
these bales of hay
to build a wall.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.620
We can make our own space.

07:02.620 --> 07:06.210
Well, how are we gonna
move these big, heavy things?

07:06.210 --> 07:07.750
We could use the pitchfork.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.670
We could use this saddle.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.540
No, we could use the pulley.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.380
Hey, good idea!

07:15.580 --> 07:17.880
Hate it, hate it, hate it.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.120
How about this?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.670
Tempting.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.460
But hate it.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.620
Come on! Pull!

07:24.620 --> 07:25.920
Pull!

07:28.540 --> 07:31.540
No, these are all
wrong, wrong, wrong!

07:31.540 --> 07:35.120
I can't hold it anymore!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.290
Uh-oh.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.580
Watch out!

07:40.580 --> 07:43.710
We don't just need
a new pattern,
my dear Anita.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.670
We need an entirely new fabric

07:46.670 --> 07:50.000
for my new
country living fashions.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.290
-Oh!
-All: Uh-oh.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.460
Anita:
Cruella, are you all right?

07:55.460 --> 07:56.500
Cruella?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.170
Hello?

07:58.170 --> 08:01.580
I've just come to
a brilliant conclusion.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.670
We'll use hay!

08:03.670 --> 08:04.710
Huh?

08:04.710 --> 08:07.330
Straw! Dry grass, dear.

08:07.330 --> 08:10.670
You want to make clothes
out of dead weeds?

08:10.670 --> 08:12.540
Accessories too.

08:12.540 --> 08:15.620
We'll call it
"clothes made out of hay."

08:15.620 --> 08:18.120
Or better yet, "hay-wear."

08:18.120 --> 08:21.290
I'm buying your entire field
of hay bales.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.620
But how to make clothes
out of hay...

08:27.920 --> 08:29.830
Brick Master,
Lamp Master, aah!

08:29.830 --> 08:31.500
Here it is!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.670
"Hay Master:
Makes clothes out of hay."

08:42.460 --> 08:44.580
Impressive, isn't it?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.670
Well, what are you
waiting for, you clods?

08:46.670 --> 08:48.790
Let's make hay-wear!

09:03.380 --> 09:05.620
Stunning. Exquisite!

09:05.620 --> 09:06.960
Pesticide free.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.750
I'll have every haystack
in this field

09:08.750 --> 09:11.460
turned into hay-wear
in no time!

09:12.500 --> 09:14.420
Every haystack?

09:14.420 --> 09:16.500
Including Pug's.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.540
Just because he's a bully
doesn't mean he deserves

09:18.540 --> 09:20.920
to be turned
into a fashion accessory.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.920
Come on!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.830
Pug! Lieutenant!

09:33.830 --> 09:35.460
Wake up!

09:35.460 --> 09:37.710
We've gotta get
you out of here!

09:37.710 --> 09:39.710
-Ow!
-Batten the hatches!

09:39.710 --> 09:41.580
Hatch the battens!
The cats are here!

09:41.580 --> 09:43.460
The cats!

09:43.460 --> 09:45.500
It's just us, Sir.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.210
They-- they got tanks!

09:48.210 --> 09:49.620
Can you hear 'em?

09:49.620 --> 09:51.170
It's not a tank.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.080
It's Cruella's machine

09:53.080 --> 09:56.040
and she's gonna
grind us all into galoshes!

09:56.040 --> 09:58.460
Lucky, it's getting closer!

09:59.580 --> 10:01.330
You're lying.
You're a traitor.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.580
A cat sympathizer.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.000
I know your type.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.330
But you won't take me alive!

10:10.540 --> 10:12.330
Why are we saving him again?

10:12.330 --> 10:15.000
Because him not being
turned into a purse

10:15.000 --> 10:18.040
is more important than
our selfish need for revenge.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.460
You're not taking
me alive, cat lovers!

10:27.500 --> 10:30.290
-Lucky: Oh no!

10:33.580 --> 10:35.250
We gotta get him out now

10:35.250 --> 10:37.330
or it's gonna be
too late for all of us!

10:37.330 --> 10:39.580
But how

10:39.580 --> 10:41.330
We could use this stick.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.120
We could use this sandbag.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.250
No, we could use the pulley.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.500
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
We got you.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.000
Heave!

10:56.420 --> 10:58.540
Everybody out!
She's coming down!

11:02.040 --> 11:04.500
Pug:
You'll be court-martialed
for this,

11:04.500 --> 11:05.880
you polka-dotted punks!

11:05.880 --> 11:07.250
Let go of me!

11:07.250 --> 11:09.380
Do you realize
what you've done?

11:09.380 --> 11:10.960
You've-- you've--

11:13.790 --> 11:15.420
My map.

11:15.420 --> 11:17.920
You saved my life.

11:17.920 --> 11:22.540
From now on,
you will be called friend.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.750
I think I will
now hit the deck

11:24.750 --> 11:27.380
and give myself 23 push-ups.

11:27.380 --> 11:32.250
-No, let's all hit the deck
and do push-ups together!

11:32.250 --> 11:34.880
A whole new Pug.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.120
All right! Double time!

11:49.120 --> 11:50.380
Left, right, left, right.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.380
Move it, move it, move it!

11:53.620 --> 11:54.790
Huh?

11:56.580 --> 11:58.710
Get the lead
out of your tails,

11:58.710 --> 12:01.250
you lily-livered,
candy-butted mutts!

12:02.540 --> 12:05.290
But we just hiked
10 miles, Sir.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.750
And that equals 70
in dog miles.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.960
Uh, Lieutenant Pug, Sir?

12:10.960 --> 12:15.330
We are all, and I speak
without irony, dog tired.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.330
That's what
my maneuvers are for.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.620
To toughen you up!

12:19.620 --> 12:24.380
This patrol's the softest,
sissiest bunch of baby bow-wows

12:24.380 --> 12:26.580
in this dog's Bark Brigade!

12:26.580 --> 12:30.330
Well, right now,
we're the tiredest.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.710
Why don't we just
set up camp here?

12:32.710 --> 12:36.620
Ugh, can't we just
sleep where we drop?

12:36.620 --> 12:38.500
After you set up a perimeter,

12:38.500 --> 12:39.750
reconnoiter the area,

12:39.750 --> 12:41.120
post a sentry,

12:41.120 --> 12:43.080
procure some firewood,
dig a latrine,

12:43.080 --> 12:45.620
retrieve potable water,
build a command center,

12:45.620 --> 12:47.170
and get me some dinner.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.460
Spot, I just reached
REM state.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.750
Sorry.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.960
I, uh, I thought
I heard somethin'.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.040
Out there in the dark.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.960
It was

13:09.960 --> 13:12.620
prolly just Rolly's stomach.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.330
There's nothing around here
to be afraid of.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.330
Pug:
You sure about that, Cadet?

13:18.330 --> 13:21.170
What about the creature?

13:21.170 --> 13:23.290
Uh, creature?

13:23.290 --> 13:25.210
You mean as in
a bok-bok-big,

13:25.210 --> 13:26.420
scary, ugly thing?

13:26.420 --> 13:28.830
Well, I don't mean
ya Aunt Tilly!

13:28.830 --> 13:32.290
I'm talkin' about
a monster so terrifying,

13:32.290 --> 13:35.080
the locals only
speak its name

13:35.080 --> 13:36.670
in a whisper.

13:36.670 --> 13:39.120
Lockjaw.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.290
All:
Huh?

13:40.290 --> 13:42.170
I said...

13:42.170 --> 13:44.420
"Lockjaw."

13:44.420 --> 13:45.540
All:
Huh?

13:45.540 --> 13:48.710
I said
"Lockjaw"!

13:50.710 --> 13:53.710
Lockjaw?

13:53.710 --> 13:56.250
Ugh, what kind
of name is that?

13:56.250 --> 14:00.290
The kind of name
you give a hideous creature.

14:00.290 --> 14:03.250
A survivor
from the dawn of time.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.290
Pug:
Lockjaw.

14:06.290 --> 14:10.960
He's half alligator,
half snapping turtle,

14:10.960 --> 14:13.170
half disgruntled
postal worker!

14:13.170 --> 14:16.120
When he opens
his choppers wide,

14:16.120 --> 14:21.210
you can her them squeak
for miles around.

14:21.210 --> 14:25.250
Have you ever seen Lockjaw?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.080
Nobody's ever seen him.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.960
But I've heard him
stomping through the night

14:30.960 --> 14:33.670
looking for his favorite dish:

14:33.670 --> 14:39.080
chicken Veronica on a bed
of marinated puppies.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.960
Is that served
with a white sauce?

14:41.960 --> 14:43.670
Rolly!

14:43.670 --> 14:45.880
Well...

14:45.880 --> 14:48.170
better try
and get some shut eye.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.170
Course, it may
be hard to sleep

14:50.170 --> 14:53.920
knowing Lockjaw could be
lurking nearby, huh?

14:58.210 --> 15:03.580
Um, do you guys think
there really is a Lockjaw?

15:03.580 --> 15:05.210
No way.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.040
It's just a scary story.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.710
Pug's just trying
to yank our leashes.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.210
Then what's that noise?!

15:15.210 --> 15:18.580
Sounds like
something big.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.580
And it's headed this way.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.500
It's Lockjaw!

15:23.500 --> 15:25.120
Now, now, Spot,

15:25.120 --> 15:27.330
we are not going to
validate your fears.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.290
Let's look at this
as a chance

15:29.290 --> 15:32.000
to embrace new lifeforms!

15:35.500 --> 15:36.920
Cadpig...

15:40.040 --> 15:41.540
I tried to warn her.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.880
Oh, I tried to warn her!

15:43.880 --> 15:46.120
It's Lockjaw!

15:48.080 --> 15:51.330
It sounded like
it came from over here.

15:54.210 --> 15:55.330
Cadpig?

15:55.330 --> 15:56.830
Cadpig?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.380
Cadpig!

16:00.120 --> 16:02.620
Oh, it's no use.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.880
Lockjaw has got her.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.080
Come on, guys.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.120
Pug's out cold,

16:10.120 --> 16:11.920
so we gotta form
a search party.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.250
Who's comin' with me?

16:13.250 --> 16:16.120
Out there?
In the dark?

16:16.120 --> 16:18.670
Hey, you guys go ahead.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.620
I'll just go back
to the campfire

16:21.620 --> 16:23.920
and establish
a command center.

16:25.170 --> 16:26.960
Maybe I'd better go with her.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.920
The chicken looks
kind of shaky.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.080
Yeah.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.290
Fine. I volunteer myself.

16:36.290 --> 16:39.330
Search party, forward ho!

17:45.330 --> 17:47.000
It's Lucky!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.210
We gotta do something!

17:51.880 --> 17:53.210
Wake up, Sir!

17:53.210 --> 17:55.420
It's an emergency!

17:56.960 --> 18:00.500
Cadet, if this ain't
a four-alarm catastrophe,

18:00.500 --> 18:02.790
I'll roll your hide
in breadcrumbs

18:02.790 --> 18:04.620
and flame broil your behind!

18:07.040 --> 18:08.460
Over here, guys!

18:08.460 --> 18:10.420
I found Lucky's paw prints!

18:14.920 --> 18:17.790
See? They end right here.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.380
See? Right by these big old--

18:20.380 --> 18:21.750
Oh, papa.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.170
Monster tracks!

18:28.170 --> 18:32.330
Retreat! Run away! Flee!

18:51.960 --> 18:54.960
Hey! Let me in! Let me in!

18:54.960 --> 18:56.540
What's the password?

18:56.540 --> 19:00.120
Ugh! Nobody said anything
about a password!

19:00.120 --> 19:02.960
Well, then how do we know
it's really you, Rolly?

19:02.960 --> 19:05.420
Come on, guys!
Lockjaw's comin'!

19:05.420 --> 19:08.000
He's gettin' real close!

19:14.330 --> 19:16.250
Guess it was Rolly after all.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.000
He was a beefy pup.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.920
Maybe the monster's full now!

19:19.920 --> 19:21.920
-Quick! Out the back way!

19:21.920 --> 19:23.880
But there is no back way!

19:23.880 --> 19:25.500
There is now!

19:28.290 --> 19:29.460
Yes!

19:31.790 --> 19:33.420
Cadet Spot, you with me?

19:33.420 --> 19:35.500
Right behind you, Sir.

19:35.500 --> 19:39.380
First Cadpig,
then Lucky, then Rolly.

19:39.380 --> 19:43.790
It's an all-you-can-eat
puppy buffet, and we're dessert!

19:43.790 --> 19:46.000
-Shh! I think I hear somethin'.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.290
He's circling around us,

19:49.290 --> 19:51.710
but whatever you do,
don't sneeze.

19:51.710 --> 19:54.750
Someone always sneezes
in these situations.

19:57.210 --> 19:59.040
Ha-ha...

19:59.040 --> 20:00.620
ha...

20:00.620 --> 20:02.040
ha...

20:02.040 --> 20:03.750
Don't sneeze, Sir.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.170
Please, oh please, don't--

20:06.170 --> 20:08.540
ha-chooooo!

20:12.750 --> 20:16.170
Uh, Lieutenant Pug?

20:16.170 --> 20:18.710
Oh, must remain calm.

20:18.710 --> 20:21.670
What did the Bark Brigade
coach say to do?

20:21.670 --> 20:22.790
Run! Run, run, run!

20:22.790 --> 20:24.080
Oh!

20:24.080 --> 20:25.880
Run, run, run-- Oh!

20:25.880 --> 20:27.790
Run, run, run-- Oh!

20:27.790 --> 20:29.080
Run! Run, run, run, run!

20:29.080 --> 20:31.290
Run, run, run,
run, run, run!

20:31.290 --> 20:33.000
Run, run, run!

20:33.000 --> 20:35.790
Run, Spot! Run!

20:36.880 --> 20:39.540
Run! Run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run!

20:42.080 --> 20:44.580
Right on cue.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.040
Can't run...

20:48.040 --> 20:50.790
can't hide.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.830
I hope you get salmonella.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.580
What are ya squawkin'
about, Spot?

20:58.580 --> 20:59.830
Captain?

20:59.830 --> 21:02.380
I've been chasin'
after you all night.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.710
I'm takin' the pups
on a hayride.

21:05.710 --> 21:08.750
Climb aboard.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.540
Hey, Spot! Up here!

21:12.880 --> 21:14.830
Was that the noise
we thought was--

21:14.830 --> 21:16.670
Both:
Uh-huh.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.330
-And that was--
-Both: Uh-huh.

21:21.330 --> 21:23.170
But what about the stomping?

21:27.670 --> 21:30.210
-I don't know.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.380
She kind of blends in
with this crowd.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.120
Lockjaw. Ha!

21:34.120 --> 21:36.170
what a crock.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.580
Pug sure made fools
of us this time.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.790
Yeah, he's probably
back at the barn

21:40.790 --> 21:42.750
laughing his head off.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.880
Very good!

21:49.880 --> 21:51.290
Airing your differences

21:51.290 --> 21:53.960
is the first step
in conflict resolution.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.170
Now Lieutenant Pug,
Mr. Jaw wants to know

21:57.170 --> 21:59.040
why you've been
spreading vicious rumors

21:59.040 --> 22:00.710
about him behind his back.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.750
He finds it dehumanizing.
