00:14.748 --> 00:18.386
(male narrator)
 Last time
 on Childrens Hospital.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.254
I don't go in
for women's lib.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.090
What are you doing
for the bicentennial?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.592
That Farrah Fawcett poster
is out of this world!

00:24.625 --> 00:26.194
Disco sucks.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.129
Up your nose
with a rubber hose.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.164
You going to see
The Captain and Tennille?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.765
- Baseball mustache.
- Khmer Rouge.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.501
- Station wagon.
- Camel toe.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.103
- Macrame.
- Cocaine.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.470
The joy of sex.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.372
- Steely Dan
- Something from the 70's.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.608
Reggie Jackson, Skylab,
Kurt Vonnegut.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.343
The energy crisis.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.579
The energy crisis, Vietnam,
Son of Sam, water gate.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.148
- Bell-bottoms.
- Vegetables.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.282
Hey!

00:51.785 --> 00:53.454
Childrens Hospital
 was filmed in front

00:53.487 --> 00:56.190
of a live studio audience.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.660
(man on radio)
'Hey, Happy New Year!'

00:59.693 --> 01:02.563
'We're counting down
the top one 100 hits of 1975.'

01:02.596 --> 01:04.565
'That was
"Panties Full of Honey"'

01:04.598 --> 01:07.535
'by the Dumb Drops, number
97, on our year-end countdown.'

01:07.568 --> 01:09.603
'I'm Glenn Beck.'

01:09.637 --> 01:13.274
'It's a rainy New Year's eve.
Lots of death in Vietnam today''

01:13.307 --> 01:14.775
'Mostly women and babies.'

01:14.808 --> 01:16.610
'And this one
goes out to them.'

01:16.644 --> 01:18.512
'It's by the
Jupiter Experience'

01:18.546 --> 01:20.781
'and it's called
"Early Morning Sex."'

01:20.814 --> 01:23.317
Here we are.
Childrens Hospital.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.686
Hey, you just
get back from 'Nam?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.155
Yeah.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.390
How does it feel
to be a baby killer?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.225
I wouldn't know.
I am a doctor.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.394
I save babies..

01:33.427 --> 01:35.863
...who later went on
to be killed by my friends.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.365
Mostly, Mark.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.734
Anyway, keep the change.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.775
[engine misfire]
Argh!

01:51.379 --> 01:54.315
[instrumental music]

01:58.886 --> 02:00.888
(woman on P.A. system)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

02:00.921 --> 02:03.791
'Answering machines
are a new invention.'

02:03.824 --> 02:05.659
Can I help you, baby killer?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.928
Hey, I served my country.
You dig?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.231
- I'm no baby killer.
- Then, who are you?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.533
I'm Dr. Glen Richie.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.502
The new abortionist.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.905
Hey, Tania.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.678
So, you wanna play
some bumper pool?

02:24.712 --> 02:28.616
- I only play regular pool.
- Hmm, righteous.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.319
Hey, when do the two
new doctors get in here?

02:31.352 --> 02:33.754
I don't know. I hear
one is a Vietnam vet.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.590
The brass has been real tight
lipped about the other one.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.426
They say he'll
somehow launch us into

02:38.459 --> 02:41.495
the first part of the fourth
quarter of the the 20th century.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.930
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.798
Maybe the new doctor
will be a monorail.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.400
Or a CB radio.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.702
Or "Twilight" heartthrob,
Robert Pattinson.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.940
'Oh-h.'

02:52.973 --> 02:56.310
Sorry, nurse. We thought
the new doctor was coming in.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.778
She did just come in.

02:57.811 --> 03:01.249
Well, first of, you mean,
he just came in.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.916
And uh, where is he?

03:02.950 --> 03:05.853
No, I most definitely
did not mean "he."

03:05.886 --> 03:09.257
What are you talking
about, nurse, uh..

03:09.290 --> 03:11.859
- What's your name again?
- The name is Lola Spratt.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.328
Dr. Lola Spratt.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.833
Righteous!

03:19.867 --> 03:21.802
- Brian.
- You're dumped.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.873
Blake, Did you hear the news?

03:25.906 --> 03:28.008
There is hostage crisis
going down.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.278
Ah, read between
the lines, Iran!

03:30.311 --> 03:32.913
Wait a second, I said hostages.
I meant hotdogs.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.583
Too many patients, not
enough hotdogs to go around.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.585
The government's supposed
to be subsidizing hotdogs.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.253
Dig this, baby.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.458
Ford, you turkey.
When will the 80's get here?

03:44.492 --> 03:45.959
Not soon enough, baby doll.

03:45.993 --> 03:46.927
Shazam!

03:49.029 --> 03:51.999
[babies bawling]

03:52.032 --> 03:55.936
Glen, my boy.
This is Chief.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.373
She is a candy-striper.
She'll show you the ropes.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.874
Thank you, Mr. Childrens.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.643
- So you just got back?
- Yeah.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.745
But I'm finding it
a little bit difficult

04:04.778 --> 04:06.780
to integrate back into society.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.417
Maybe, this will help you
keep your mind on work.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.052
This is our brand new
state of the art heart monitor.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.521
'Oh, right on.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.524
[rumbling]

04:16.557 --> 04:19.726
This doesn't sound right.
This needs calibrating.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.928
So, what did you do
over there anyway?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.531
I saved lives.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.366
I got beaucoup laid.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.601
I got into this Vietnamese band
called "The Doors."

04:27.635 --> 04:29.637
I don't know how it
translates into English.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.071
This is our new,
Dialysis machine.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.673
[rumbling]

04:32.706 --> 04:34.074
Ugh!

04:34.107 --> 04:36.477
I guess this one
needs calibrating too.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.347
Hey...if-if you're
just a candy-striper

04:39.380 --> 04:40.781
why do they call you "Chief?"

04:40.814 --> 04:43.016
I'm a 100% Choctaw Indian.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.885
Oh. This here is an example

04:44.918 --> 04:46.854
of our in-vitro
fertilization technology.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.623
[indistinct yelling]

04:49.657 --> 04:51.792
Oh, my God!
What are you doing..

04:53.827 --> 04:55.629
Well, this one needs
to sound less

04:55.663 --> 04:56.664
like Vietnamese people yelling.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.566
I think I broke your test tube.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.334
(male #2)
'Test tube baby killer!'

05:00.368 --> 05:03.471
And with that, I welcome
Childrens Hospital's new doctor

05:03.504 --> 05:05.573
or should I say, doctoress.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.475
Dr. Lola Spratt.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.543
[applause]

05:09.577 --> 05:11.812
- Questions?
- Are you aware..

05:11.845 --> 05:15.749
(male #3)
'How many female doctors does it
take to screw in a light bulb?'

05:15.783 --> 05:18.719
(male #4)
'How can you be
doctor without pants?'

05:18.752 --> 05:22.055
In your opinion, is a woman even
smart enough to be a doctor?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.558
No way. This ain't like
making no chicken cacciatore

05:24.592 --> 05:26.059
or beef stroganoff.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.061
You can't operate on
someone using sex appeal.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.665
You move fast on
those getaway sticks, baby.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.467
That's Dr. Baby to you.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.869
Cool out, woman.
You wanna lude?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.605
I want to be taken seriously.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.874
I went to medical school for
the same number of years as you.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.876
I want respect,
I want my due.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.778
And I wanna lude, yes.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.414
I do want one of those.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.015
I think you're brave.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.050
What made you wanna
become a lady doctor?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.852
I don't know.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.987
- I'm an Aquarius, so.
- You're an Aquarius?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.023
What a co-incidence.
I'm bi-sexual.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.692
You got anybody to kiss
at midnight tonight?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.060
Dr. Spratt.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.829
Your 3 o'clock operation
has been cancelled.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.664
Cancelled? Why?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.066
The patient doesn't want a
woman to operate on him.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.652
What a dick.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.487
(woman on P.A.)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

06:26.520 --> 06:29.423
'I'm easy, easy
like Sunday morning.'

06:29.457 --> 06:30.791
'That is all.'

06:30.824 --> 06:32.826
Got to get this
New Year's punch bowl

06:32.860 --> 06:35.062
in the cafeteria.
I mean, what the hey, man?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.897
There are lines
like this for hotdogs

06:36.930 --> 06:39.099
in every hospital
in the country.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.934
Almost doesn't seem
worth it, you know?

06:40.968 --> 06:43.804
Hey! Don't you ever say that.
Hotdogs are a part

06:43.837 --> 06:45.606
of what makes
this country great.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.476
It's a coincidence that hotdogs
are shaped like dongs?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.810
No way, Jose!

06:49.843 --> 06:51.712
Hotdogs are our
country's penis.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.614
You get that through
your head, Jose.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.716
Cheese Louise!
Take a lude, why don't you?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.851
Sorry. I don't know
what got into me.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.853
I can't take lude,
it would counteract

06:59.887 --> 07:01.722
all the cocaine
that I just took.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.693
Oh, wait, that's what gotten
into me. I just took cocaine.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.728
This country is falling apart.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.962
[glass shattering]

07:08.996 --> 07:11.499
Damn! Damn! Damn!

07:13.066 --> 07:15.002
These are not good times.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.240
I'm not letting some
skirt take my tonsils out.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.643
Hey, it's Dr. Skirt to you.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.211
Relax, baby.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.846
I'll take the kid's
tonsils out.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.781
Ahh..

07:27.815 --> 07:31.218
I'm not letting her do it.
Do you think I'll let you?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.920
You are black and retarded.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.623
- You little mother--
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.992
- What's going on here?
- Leave us alone, baby killer.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.161
You hear that, kid?
Women, right?

07:41.194 --> 07:43.864
Sure, sometimes they
piss us off, call us names.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.934
And sometimes, we wanna
call them names back.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.570
Like "bitch"
or "whore" or "slut"

07:49.603 --> 07:50.938
or something like that.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.240
Whore's a good one.
I like "whore."

07:53.273 --> 07:57.044
I can't even begin to list
the names for Brian here.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.146
"Shine" comes to mind.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.815
That's a weird one.
Popular in all detective novels.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.184
And let me tell you something,
this particular whore

08:04.217 --> 08:06.620
and this particular shine

08:06.654 --> 08:09.857
they went to medical school
which making them a lot better

08:09.890 --> 08:11.692
than a lot of the slut bags

08:11.725 --> 08:13.193
and schvartz out there.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.263
And it makes them a hell
of a lot better than you.

08:16.296 --> 08:19.099
'You got it?

08:19.132 --> 08:21.635
Fine. I'll get my tonsils out.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.236
But you have to do it.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.038
- Righteous.
- Alright, let's do it.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.812
Take out his
sparerib for $200.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.047
- Oh, you'll never do that.
- Don't touch the side.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.816
Here goes his funny bone.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.650
It takes a very steady hand.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.886
I did it!
That's $200 for me.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.322
Oh, damn it! I nicked his
artery, he's bleeding out.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.157
Butter fingers.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.594
- Suture below the incision.
- Where? I can't see it.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.829
Here! Diagonally.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.898
Pretty sneaky, sis.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.201
[long beep]

08:54.234 --> 08:55.268
(together)
'Sorry.'

08:59.239 --> 09:01.274
I can't believe we lost him.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.812
Happy New Year?
More like unhappy New Year.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.079
[laughing]

09:06.113 --> 09:07.915
Good one, Blake.
Hope you never lose

09:07.948 --> 09:09.683
your ability to
make people laugh.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.319
Glen, thanks for these hotdogs.
Where did you get them anyway?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.955
Uh, I learnt how to
make them back in 'Nam.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.790
I knew it would
come handy someday.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.792
How was your first day, you two?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.862
Ah, it was tough one.
Reminds me of that day in Danang

09:21.895 --> 09:25.132
when we killed a bunch of babies
and made hotdogs out of them.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.935
- 'How about you, Lola?'
- Oh, it was fine.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.971
But I just got my period.
So, I'm gonna go home sick.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.307
Before you do..

09:34.341 --> 09:35.809
- ...it's almost midnight.
- Yeah.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.045
Did you ever decide
who you wanted to kiss?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.881
Yeah, I did.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.051
I wanna kiss...all of you.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.854
I think we are gonna make
quite an interesting team.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.656
[laughing]

09:48.689 --> 09:50.691
Come on.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.728
My first kiss.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.263
Mwah.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.598
[laughing]

09:59.199 --> 10:01.201
Oh, boy.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.003
Yeah.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.373
'What's happening?'

10:18.886 --> 10:21.822
[moaning]

10:41.842 --> 10:43.944
My first orgasm.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.013
(man on P.A. system)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

10:46.046 --> 10:48.281
'Paging a very smart
15 year old boy'

10:48.315 --> 10:50.317
'named Barrack Obama.'

10:50.350 --> 10:51.885
'That is all.'

10:51.919 --> 10:53.921
Any comments on
the current hotdog crisis?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.990
As matter of fact, I do, man.
My father was a hot dog.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.291
He got murdered.
