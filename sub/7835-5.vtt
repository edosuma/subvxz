01:23.959 --> 01:25.501
Putting away groceries,

01:25.586 --> 01:28.212
it's like unwrapping
presents from yourself.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.632
Fruit Roll-Ups for Bart.
Beer Roll-Ups for Homer.

01:32.843 --> 01:36.179
Burly? I bought the wrong brand, Maggie.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.640
I'll just take them right
back to the store and...

01:39.725 --> 01:40.767
Whoa!

01:42.895 --> 01:46.272
Look at those massive plaid shoulders!

01:48.192 --> 01:51.986
Look at that absorbativity!
I've gotta tell someone.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.658
I came home as quick as
I could. What's going on?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.912
Watch what happens when
I spill this blue liquid.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.042
You pulled me out of school for this?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.586
Absolutely. You're about to get a lesson

02:08.669 --> 02:10.170
in value.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.719
And Burly's still got soaking
power. Spill something else.

02:16.887 --> 02:17.845
Mom, I believe you.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.722
Spill it.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.559
Hmm?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.770
Ooh, Burly, you're insatiable.

02:29.733 --> 02:34.320
Oh, Burly, you're so rugged and manly.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.447
Marge, a bee almost stung me today.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.866
I felt the wind go right by my ear.

02:40.244 --> 02:43.538
Oh, it's okay, Homie.
The bee's all gone.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.498
Mmm!

02:46.583 --> 02:50.336
Fantasize, Marge. Fantasize about Burly.

02:53.590 --> 02:58.010
Hey, you're looking at that
spokes-jack. Well, I can fantasize, too.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.846
Hmm.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.181
Ooh! Mama Celeste.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.726
You touch me and I cut you.

03:08.105 --> 03:12.859
Homer, I'll tell you what I told
Redford. It ain't gonna happen.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.948
"Dear Burly, comma, I've never written
to a registered trademark before.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.827
"Are you a real person or just
a composite? Question Mark.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.538
"In either case, I would
love a signed photo.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.832
"Sincerely, Marge Simpson. "

03:36.675 --> 03:39.802
"Love"? "Signed photo"?

03:39.887 --> 03:43.222
Marge hasn't asked me for
a signed photo in months.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.182
Well, I'll show her.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.771
Hello?

03:50.856 --> 03:53.941
We have a person-to-person
call for Marge Simpson.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.735
Person-to-person!

03:55.819 --> 03:57.945
Hello. This is Chad Sexington,

03:58.030 --> 04:00.156
the model for Burly Paper Towels.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.117
How did you get my number?

04:03.201 --> 04:07.121
I don't know. But I was
quite moved by your letter.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.333
I'd love to meet you and your
family. Shall we say dinner?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.376
Oh, my goodness...

04:12.461 --> 04:14.462
Perfect. I'll be there at 7:00.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.341
Oh, my God! Dinner with Burly!

04:23.931 --> 04:25.765
Playing a prankeroo, eh?

04:25.849 --> 04:29.310
I was having a private
conversation with my wife

04:29.394 --> 04:32.980
in the guise of Chad
Sexington. Do you mind?

04:39.404 --> 04:42.615
So, how was your day? Did
anything unbelievable happen?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.617
Phone calls? Things of that nature?

04:44.701 --> 04:45.993
You're not gonna believe it.

04:46.078 --> 04:50.331
That paper towel lumberjack is
coming here for dinner tonight.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.377
Tonight? Well, you
better get your hopes up.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.836
I will.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.138
That's him!

05:06.223 --> 05:07.348
Oh, my God!

05:13.772 --> 05:16.482
Why, look. It's Chad Sexington!

05:16.566 --> 05:19.276
Hey, baby! I'm that guy you like.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.822
Barney? Where's Chad? I...

05:27.452 --> 05:30.538
Congratulations. I feel ridiculous.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.586
You mean I was just a
prop in some cruel joke?

05:39.423 --> 05:43.050
Now you've done it. You've
really humiliated Mom.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.137
It was hard on me, too.
I had to wear a suit.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.388
Oh...

05:47.472 --> 05:50.349
You're right. I've
gotta make it up to her.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.518
I suggest dinner and a show.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.938
How about Benihana,
where dinner is the show?

05:57.441 --> 05:58.566
No, huh?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.112
Walking to hell and back again

06:03.447 --> 06:05.823
I guess it was a pretty funny prank.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.284
I like the ones where
nothing catches on fire.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.079
Yeah. Nothing is hurt except feelings.

06:13.081 --> 06:18.002
Walking to hell and back again

06:20.505 --> 06:24.717
Okay. You've seen our next performer
on Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin

06:24.801 --> 06:27.344
and Art Linkletter's House Party.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.432
Please welcome Mesmerino,
the hip hypnotist.

06:32.559 --> 06:36.020
Thank you. Thank you very,
very much, ladies and gentlemen.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.689
Let's see. Who do we have here?

06:38.774 --> 06:40.274
Well, what's the matter with you, champ?

06:40.358 --> 06:41.609
You couldn't find a date?

06:41.693 --> 06:44.904
I didn't come here to be
heckled and spoofed and whatnot.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.864
Why did you come here? Seriously though.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.033
When I snap my fingers, my friend,

06:49.117 --> 06:52.578
you will be a make-out artist.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.498
Glayvin! That's a powerful...

06:55.832 --> 06:56.916
Whoa!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.418
Hold it 'cause it's different!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.715
Hey, cupcake, listen good.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.300
I want you to swallow that gum

07:06.384 --> 07:10.930
and meet me in the coatroom,
in five, four, three, two, now.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.432
Whatever you say, Professor.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.184
And back you go.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.477
Ooh! Hey!

07:16.561 --> 07:19.271
No, no, don't make me! I don't
want to go back to the nothing!

07:19.356 --> 07:20.356
I don't...

07:23.026 --> 07:25.111
Oh, dear. I've redorkulated.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.240
Hey, smart move, Four-Eyes.

07:29.324 --> 07:33.035
Sitting next to Skeletor here
makes you look like Hercules.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.582
Zing.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.750
What's a "Skeletor"?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.418
No, no, I kid. But seriously,

07:41.503 --> 07:43.796
it's very nice to see a
young man take his father out

07:43.880 --> 07:45.214
for a night of hypnotism

07:45.298 --> 07:46.632
before he dies.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.345
Actually, my father
died a long time ago.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.433
Okay. Is anyone here
not a downer? Anyone?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.060
Do me! Do me!

08:02.232 --> 08:04.650
I am in your power. Boss me around.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.863
When I snap my fingers,
you will transform into

08:08.947 --> 08:11.574
a famous historian.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.452
Look at me! I'm a famous
historian! Out of my way!

08:17.747 --> 08:21.458
Thank you. Now you are Emily Dickinson.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.421
Look at me! I'm Angie
Dickinson! Out of my way!

08:27.424 --> 08:30.009
Now you are a young boy,

08:30.093 --> 08:33.304
uh, yourself at 12 years old.

08:34.890 --> 08:38.017
I'm 12 years old. I'm with my friends.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.854
It's a beautiful summer day
at the old swimming hole.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.522
Oh, my God!

08:46.902 --> 08:48.861
Do something, Mesmerino.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.738
Uh, yes. Yes.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.699
That's better.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.416
Dad, what's wrong?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.293
We better get him home.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.256
There you go.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.485
Hmm!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.655
And Bart is set for the week.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.536
Oh, no.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.123
Sorry, Mrs. S. He was kind
of disrupting things at work.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.502
Yeah. He ruined naptime and quiet time.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.171
Oh, Homie, you poor thing.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.510
Oh, cool. He's still mental.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.138
Yeah. My hunch is he's struggling
with some sort of repressed memory.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.849
Hmm. How do we unrepress it?

10:00.934 --> 10:04.937
Well, the Yaqui Indians brew a
special tea that unlocks memories.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.023
It would be a good excuse
to use my Yaqui tea set.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.862
Well, is anything coming back to you?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.197
Oh.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.034
There have been so many
classic Simpson moments.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.038
I remember that time I tried
to jump over Springfield Gorge.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.291
I'm gonna make it!

10:25.375 --> 10:27.209
No, Dad. Everyone's sick of that memory.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.962
Try to remember back when you were 12.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.464
Something frightening
must have happened.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.258
Hmm. Twelve.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.136
Well, I remember I
used to go hiking a lot

10:37.220 --> 10:39.013
with these two guys.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.432
It was one of those lazy summer days

10:41.516 --> 10:43.142
you thought would last forever.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.394
And to kill the boredom, we sang.

10:53.361 --> 10:57.781
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream

10:58.616 --> 11:01.910
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen

11:05.332 --> 11:08.917
Check it out, Fat Tony. Those
jokers think they're The Cowsills.

11:09.336 --> 11:14.131
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

11:15.550 --> 11:19.094
You guys have blundered into
our secret tobaccy patch.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.847
Wow! Is that wacky tobaccy?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.349
The wackiest.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.975
Let's punch and kick them!

11:27.896 --> 11:29.688
Not so fast.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.524
He's got a Daisy.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.650
We better scram.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.028
Eighteen more pumps,
that could break the skin.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.364
Hey, thanks, Moe.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.867
And that's how a troubled
young Moe saved the day.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.869
Moe, what are you
doing here? What am I...

11:43.953 --> 11:47.247
My bar is empty is what.
Why ain't you guys there?

11:47.332 --> 11:50.542
We're trying to uncover a hidden
trauma in my dad's childhood.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.628
What? You mean that time he wigged out?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.963
Well, give me some of that
Indian memory tea there

11:55.048 --> 11:56.924
and I'll tell you all about it.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.845
Mmm! That's good Yaqui.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.933
Okay. That night we
camped out under the stars.

12:09.062 --> 12:13.941
Look at all them stars. Bunch of lazy
lights, don't do nothing for nobody.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.776
Hey, you know what
I'm looking forward to?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.904
The future. Have you heard
about this Internet thing?

12:18.988 --> 12:20.239
Internet?

12:20.323 --> 12:24.034
Yeah. It's the inner netting
they invented to line swim trunks.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.495
It provides a comforting snugness.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.499
Hey, what was that?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.918
That's that nuclear
plant they just opened.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.170
Yeah, that's your future, busting atoms.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.424
Can you imagine us working
there? The whole Carl Crew?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.884
Hey, I thought we were
called Lenny and the Jets.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.177
Hey, you're both wrong.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.431
We're the Moe Szyslak
Experience, featuring Homer.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.141
I like the sound of that.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.267
Friends forever?

12:48.351 --> 12:50.310
Friends forever.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.437
Ow!

12:51.521 --> 12:52.646
Ow! That hurts! Man, we're stupid.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.981
I hate you guys.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.776
The next morning we went out to
the old quarry to have a swim.

12:57.861 --> 13:01.447
You guys really gonna dive off of here?

13:01.531 --> 13:04.158
Not me. I'm shaking
like a French soldier.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.952
Yeah. I think I just
logged on to my Internet.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.495
Only a moron would jump into that...

13:08.580 --> 13:10.038
Geronimo!

13:11.249 --> 13:13.208
Oh, my God!

13:19.215 --> 13:21.884
And there's your
whatchamacall repressed trauma.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.094
I mean, who likes getting
muddy? It's terrible.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.804
Okay. Let's go to Moe's now.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.224
Wait a minute. I remember
falling in the mud.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.227
But I don't think that's
why I've been screaming.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.313
Fine. Crap all over my theory.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.399
Something else happened in that quarry.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.234
Something else.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.696
Hey, what happened to all the water?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.324
Hmm.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.576
Hey, there's something blocking it.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.661
Hey, come on.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.666
Come on, Homer! We're going
to Sears to feel the bras!

13:55.376 --> 13:57.252
What the heck is that thing?

14:18.942 --> 14:21.527
You found a corpse when you were 12?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.155
No wonder you've been so traumatized.

14:27.325 --> 14:32.079
It's responsible for
everything wrong in my life.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.959
My occasional overeating,
my fear of corpses.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.756
What I want to know is what the
heck was that body doing there?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.008
Maybe there's murder afoot.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.468
Murder most foul?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.594
Maybe.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.805
You know, if Dad never told anyone,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.558
that body must still be out there.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.937
This sounds like a case that
only the Simpson family can solve.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.146
Oh.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.525
Okay. Uh, well, we'll
just be going then.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.236
Hey, you guys can come with us.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.280
No, no, no. He said "Simpson family. "

15:06.364 --> 15:07.823
I mean, you know, it sounded exciting.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.200
But, you know, we don't want to intrude.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.868
Thanks for understanding.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.036
Oh.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.622
Oh, okay. Well...

15:16.416 --> 15:18.041
I'll see ya.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.553
Bye, Moe.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.978
Yep. The old quarry is
just a stone's throw away.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.605
Stop saying that, Dad.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.772
Never.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.026
Hey, there's Mesmerino.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.072
Seventeen seventy-six.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.785
"How much is left in
my checking account. "

15:57.749 --> 16:01.293
This is it. This is the old quarry.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.630
Maybe we should come
back in the daytime.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.174
Someone's yellow belly is showing.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.342
Oh, sorry.

16:11.763 --> 16:12.971
Ah, geez. Right in the eyes.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.139
Chief Wiggum!

16:14.223 --> 16:16.099
Who's there? How do you...
How do you know my name?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.976
It's us, the Simpsons.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.311
Oh.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.772
I saw your car by the gate and I...

16:21.856 --> 16:24.232
Well, I thought you
might be lost hikers.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.110
'Cause then I could
rescue you, and be a hero.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.612
And maybe the city would give me

16:28.696 --> 16:31.198
a coupon for free guitar lessons.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.742
So what are you doing here?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.453
We're investigating a
possible murder case.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.165
Oh. You mind if I tag along?
I'm kind of a crime buff.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.420
If there's a body in
here, we'll drag it up.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.219
Heck. It's just an old shopping cart.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.637
Oh, and it's empty.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.598
Put it back. I don't
want to see it this way.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.435
We'll never find the
body under all this water.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.978
Water, eh?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.481
Burly to the rescue!

17:07.944 --> 17:10.319
Oh, that is so cool.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.742
Hey! What's that over there?

17:19.789 --> 17:21.080
Don't get excited.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.501
It's just a skull-shaped rock
and a bunch of white sticks.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.086
It's the body.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.380
And someone has eaten the flesh.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.466
But whose body is it?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.510
And who sent it down that pipe?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.601
Now do you believe
dead rats float, Lisa?

17:41.686 --> 17:42.686
Yes.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.233
Well, looks like the end of the line.

17:48.317 --> 17:53.739
That means our murderer could be
on the other side of this hatch.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.425
What are you doing in my corpse hatch?

18:13.509 --> 18:16.762
Montgomery Burns, you're
under arrest for murder.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.849
Did I say corpse hatch?
I meant "innocence tube. "

18:20.933 --> 18:23.310
Then how do you explain this?

18:24.937 --> 18:28.064
I've been expecting
this day for 30 years.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.400
In a way, it's a relief.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.486
But in another way, it's most unwelcome.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.238
All right, quit stalling,
Burns. Who'd you ice?

18:35.323 --> 18:38.492
I'm afraid that skull
belongs to my dear friend,

18:38.576 --> 18:40.911
Waylon Smithers Senior.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.080
Mr. Smithers' father!

18:44.165 --> 18:46.208
But I did not murder him.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.587
And I can prove it

18:50.671 --> 18:52.464
with this film.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.383
Ooh! A movie! I call the couch!

18:56.844 --> 19:00.222
If you see only one film this
year that proves my innocence,

19:00.306 --> 19:01.681
make it this one.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.520
Why are these numbers so high?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.188
Why is that red light flashing?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.773
And what's that alarming sound?

19:09.857 --> 19:12.400
Smithers, get in here! Smithers!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.695
Sorry, Monty. I was
feeding Waylon Junior.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.697
Will you put that baby down?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.867
There's something wrong
with the reactor core.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.122
I better go in and have a look.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.541
No, Waylon Senior.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.459
It could be filled
with atoms, and steam,

19:29.544 --> 19:31.169
and other nuclear
bric-a-brac.

19:31.254 --> 19:34.089
If this reactor blows,
the whole town is doomed,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.841
including my son.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.974
So, you're a baby, huh? How's
that working out for you?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.810
He did it!

19:46.894 --> 19:49.020
Look at your heroic daddy in there

19:49.105 --> 19:52.023
making funny faces,
falling to the floor,

19:52.108 --> 19:55.652
shedding his hair,
lying perfectly still...

19:56.404 --> 19:58.321
Oh, dear.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.781
Sir.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.248
Smithers Senior gave his
life to save the plant.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.375
And since cover-ups were
all the rage back then,

20:10.459 --> 20:13.086
I shoved his heroic
corpse down the sewer pipe.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.964
I never told Smithers the
truth about his father.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.966
Until tonight, sir.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.969
Smithers Junior.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.470
Ha! Busted.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.891
Now the movie's turned into
a play. Still good though.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.726
I'm sorry I lied to you, Waylon.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.770
But I wanted to spare you the details
of your father's gruesome death.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.983
Well, I'm glad to know he died
a hero instead of that other way.

20:35.443 --> 20:39.905
I told him his father was killed in
the Amazon by a tribe of savage women.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.740
I hope it didn't affect you in any way.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.325
We'll never know, sir.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.165
Well, Marge, we solved the
case of the haunted quarry.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.586
Homer, shouldn't we give
that skull to Mr. Smithers?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.421
Why? He'd just bury it.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.759
Hey! Hey! I found a clue that's
gonna bust your mystery wide open.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.802
Sorry. We already solved it.

21:02.887 --> 21:03.887
Oh.

21:04.013 --> 21:08.266
Well, you want to take a look
at it anyways just for ha-ha's?

21:08.351 --> 21:09.935
Seems kind of pointless now.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.519
Yeah, I guess you're right.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.438
It's just that, you know,
I went to a lot of trouble,

21:13.522 --> 21:16.274
you know, making the
envelope and everything.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.610
Let's see what you have, Moe.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.778
Okay.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.155
Now this first thing is just
gonna look like a used Band-Aid,

21:22.239 --> 21:23.281
and it is.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.992
But the rest of the stuff
don't make no sense without it.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.619
So, you know, bear with me.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.581
Wow, Moe. You've been
doing a lot of sleuthing.

21:31.666 --> 21:35.168
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I sleuthed
my ass off on this one.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.296
Okay, this is a number six
from somebody's address.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.591
Or is it a nine? You don't know.

21:41.676 --> 21:45.261
This is gravel. Okay? Gravel.

21:45.346 --> 21:45.971
This is... That's more gravel. Okay. Oh!

21:45.972 --> 21:48.765
This is... That's more gravel. Okay. Oh!

21:48.849 --> 21:53.853
This is a shell that, to
me, this is just me talking.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.855
It looks like a helmet for a mouse.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.650
Now, that sounds crazy, right?

21:58.734 --> 22:02.946
But if you ask the mice about
it, they don't say nothing.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.990
I mean, they run the other way.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.659
At first, I was just fishing
with the helmet thing.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.745
But then from the mouse reaction I got,

22:10.830 --> 22:14.165
I got a little more concerned.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.752
You really made that envelope?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.088
'Cause it says "Hammermill" over here.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.800
Um... No.
