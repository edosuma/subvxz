out of counting his calluses.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.761
I wanted hands like his.

his life farming,

you could tell the worth
of a person

with their hands.

by Habitat for Humanity.

that showing up

so eloquently expressed,

It's with Charley.

42:21.320 --> 42:23.049
Working for her at the mill.

42:27.980 --> 42:32.098
I just want to be
left alone

42:32.150 --> 42:33.708
Can't you see

42:33.760 --> 42:38.379
I'm trying
to find my way home?

42:38.420 --> 42:42.459
I just want
to be left alone

42:42.510 --> 42:44.068
Can't you see

42:44.120 --> 42:47.817
I'm trying
to find my way home?

42:47.860 --> 42:49.555
Please don't
bother me.
