Hey. What?

00:22.310 --> 00:23.480
Are you okay?

00:29.610 --> 00:30.820
Jake. I can't.

00:30.860 --> 00:31.990
Hey. I'm running late.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.820
But I'll be there in
a few minutes.

00:33.860 --> 00:34.910
I really gotta talk to you
about something.

00:34.950 --> 00:35.910
It's okay Jake.

00:35.950 --> 00:36.660
Something just
came up.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.030
Can we talk later?

00:38.080 --> 00:42.450
Okay. But there's kinda been
a big change in my life.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.330
And I didn't want to talk to you
about this over the phone.

00:44.370 --> 00:45.460
But I wanna make sure that I'm
the first person that tells you.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.000
You know what I mean?

00:47.040 --> 00:48.290
Is this your way of telling me
you're dating someone else.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.630
No. No. Leslie--

00:50.670 --> 00:52.760
I got problems of my own,
in that regard.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.260
What's that supposed to mean?

00:55.300 --> 00:57.050
You're seeing someone.
I understand.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.680
You don't owe me anything.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.890
I appreciate the heads up.

[gunshots]

01:02.810 --> 01:03.730
Are those gunshots?

01:03.770 --> 01:05.020
Jake. I gotta go.

01:05.060 --> 01:05.940
No. Leslie!

01:13.150 --> 01:14.070
Brock.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.030
This is Sergeant Bennett.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.580
I need backup.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.490

Brock Purcell.
I remember him.

Drug addict.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.210
Former.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.630
He was a bouncer here
at this club.

He gave me this just before
he was killed.

He wanted to talk to you and
then he ends up dead?

02:18.380 --> 02:19.470
He was my informant.

02:19.510 --> 02:21.470
We haven't spoken for
a few weeks.

02:21.510 --> 02:24.220
I guess someone didn't want him
talking to the cops.

I just can't believe
someone killed Brock.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.860
Are you sure he's dead?

03:16.900 --> 03:18.360
Melissa, how well did
you know him?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.360
Well, he worked at the bar.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.240
I mean, he was a bouncer
here for over a year.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.410
You know, he was a good guy,
Brock.

03:26.450 --> 03:27.870
Is it true he had
a bit of a temper?

03:27.910 --> 03:29.040
Yeah, he had a temper--

03:29.080 --> 03:31.170
Sure. But I mean,
he was a bouncer.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.540
He kept everyone safe.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.710
And you know, his temper was
usually pretty in check.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.760
What about today? Did
anybody test his patience?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, there was this guy

03:38.800 --> 03:39.840
getting in his face.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.800
He tried to pick me up.

03:43.970 --> 03:46.430
Thanks for this.
We'll be in touch.

03:53.810 --> 03:54.650
Hi Jake.

03:54.690 --> 03:55.900
Hey.

03:55.940 --> 03:56.820
Are you okay?
I've been trying to reach you

03:56.860 --> 03:58.440
for, like, the last hour.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.900
Yeah, I'm busy. I'm a lead on a
shooting. There's been a murder.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.320
Okay. I'm sorry. You
must have your hands full.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.820
Okay. We can talk later
if you want.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.070
Have someone check

04:05.120 --> 04:06.660
all the contents
of that dumpster at the scene.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.740
I don't care if it's
rotten garbage.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.410
Sorry Jake. What was it you
wanted to tell me earlier?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.670
Leslie, it's okay.
Alright, we could--

04:14.500 --> 04:15.920
We'll pick it up later on.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.250
You just finish whatever
you're doing.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.170
Go be awesome.

04:26.470 --> 04:27.810
Hey!

04:27.850 --> 04:29.100
What is this.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.140
One, two, three of you.
One of him.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.100
You must be some
serious tough guys.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.230
I mean, all three of you gotta
gang up on one guy like this.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.270
Mind your business friend.
Walk away.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.190
Friend. If I was your friend
I'd tell you.

04:40.230 --> 04:40.900
Look behind you.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.320
See that thing up there?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.280
It's a weather station.
Attached to it is a camera.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.740
It's recording you.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.620
The cops are
probably already on their way.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.040
This ain't over.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.500
You.

04:55.540 --> 04:56.790
Thanks for the tip.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.420
The world gets more Orwellian
every day, huh?

05:06.180 --> 05:08.050
You have got to be kidding me.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.470
Callum Pardy.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.600
How are you?

05:10.640 --> 05:11.350
Perfect.

05:11.390 --> 05:12.810
It had to be you.

05:12.850 --> 05:15.600
That doesn't exactly sound like
gratitude to me, Callum.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.980
You're probably
loving this, huh?

05:18.020 --> 05:20.320
Just gonna run straight to
Leslie. Tell her all about it.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.070
Those guys. They were some
serious thugs.

05:24.110 --> 05:25.990
They were giving you
a good going over.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.030
Who's the big guy?
The guy with the voice.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.620
His name's Ray Maddox.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.580
I owe him a bunch of money
from eight years ago.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.250
I was a different guy
back then.

05:36.290 --> 05:36.460
How much?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.380
Look. I appreciate your concern
and everything, Jake.

05:40.420 --> 05:41.250
But it's not of your business.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.300
Just stay the hell out
of my way.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.340
My concern--

05:47.380 --> 05:48.680
is not for you.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.050
Okay pally?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.680
It's for Leslie Bennett.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.140
Whatever the hell you got
her tangled up in.

05:58.060 --> 05:58.980
Hey, Jess.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.690
What do you got?

06:01.570 --> 06:02.980
Some interesting stuff.

06:03.020 --> 06:05.070
Your boy Brock got one
in the chest. Mid-range.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.360
No exit round.

06:06.860 --> 06:07.570
Gun?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.030
Thirty eight.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.660
You stealing evidence now?

06:15.700 --> 06:18.080
You know I love talking
stuff out with you.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.580
This is an easier route.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.580
You know ballistics.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.960
Less red tape.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.090
Got ya.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.090
And I know you
and Brock were close.

06:27.590 --> 06:28.930
I'm sorry, Leslie.

06:28.970 --> 06:31.470
Yeah. He was doing
well. He was almost

06:31.510 --> 06:33.100
like a baby brother
to me sometimes.

06:35.060 --> 06:35.890
So--

06:35.930 --> 06:36.930
You found

06:36.980 --> 06:38.100
two types of
casings on the scene.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.270
Thirty eight.
And a nine mil.

06:40.310 --> 06:41.650
Two were shot
by the thirty eight,

06:41.690 --> 06:43.730
by the murderer, killing Brock.

06:43.770 --> 06:44.690
And this one--

06:44.730 --> 06:45.650
This one,

06:45.690 --> 06:46.740
the nine mil--

06:46.780 --> 06:47.610
hit a wall for sure.

06:47.650 --> 06:48.990
Brick?

06:49.030 --> 06:51.780
Exactly. Three casings.
Two from the thirty eight.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.160
And one from the
nine millimeter.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.040
But only two slugs.

06:55.490 --> 06:58.120
We're missing the second slug
from the thirty eight.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.080
Yeah. My team scoured the area.
Triple checked.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.500
So there were two shooters.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.750
Could Brock have fired?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.130
I know we didn't find
a gun on him.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.260
But somebody could have taken
it after the fact.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.760
There's only one way
to find out.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.970
Perform a residue test on
Brock's hands, just to be safe.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.810
Hey.

07:18.390 --> 07:19.270
You okay?

07:19.940 --> 07:20.850
Yeah.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.480
I got a lot on my mind.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.900
Keep me posted if you find
anything else.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.360
Sergeant Bennett.
I just want to say

07:29.400 --> 07:30.700
what an honor it is
to work this case with you.

07:30.740 --> 07:31.860
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.410
Stop sucking up.
Out with it.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.200
We found a smear of blood on
the door inside the club.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.540
[Leslie]
That makes no sense.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.200
[Grayson] I know. Brock was
found in the alley outside.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.330
The missing slug.

07:41.370 --> 07:42.500
This blood isn't Brock's.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.460
The person we're looking
for was shot,

07:44.500 --> 07:46.460
and made their getaway
back through the club.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.420
I'll put an alert out in the
hospital emergency room.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.510
See if anyone comes in

07:49.550 --> 07:50.720
with anything resembling
a gunshot wound.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.800
Good. Do it.

07:51.840 --> 07:52.760
[Tinny]
So the bartender--

07:52.800 --> 07:54.220
Melissa,
gave us a phone number.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.180
Apparently this is the guy
that Brock had a run in with

07:56.220 --> 07:57.140
just before he was killed.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.100
Doug Randell.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.180
What's his story?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.180
[Tinny]
He doesn't have a record.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.890
But he did some
contract work

08:01.940 --> 08:03.060
at the military base in Labrador

08:03.100 --> 08:04.310
Military?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.060
If he's got a bullet in him--
He's our guy.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.440
I sent a cruiser to his house.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.650
No, stop it. Send an unmarked
car, issue an APB.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.650
What about
Brock's place?

08:10.690 --> 08:12.450
Let me handle that.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.370
[ringing]

08:18.410 --> 08:19.740
Callum?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.830
[Callum] Hey. I'm at the
station. Where are you?

08:21.870 --> 08:23.120
What?
What are you doing there?

08:23.160 --> 08:25.080
A shooting involving
Military personnel.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.460
You know very well
that is my domain, Little Miss.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.550
Well, I would have told you.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.420
But you didn't come
home last night.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.420
I know. I'm sorry.
It was work.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.510
It's been a mad week.

08:33.550 --> 08:34.800
And the Department of Defense
wants me

08:34.840 --> 08:36.220
to stay on top of
this case here.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.970
So, listen.

08:38.010 --> 08:38.720
You chief suspect
is Doug Randell?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.270
You know him?

08:40.310 --> 08:41.890
Yeah, sort of. He worked for
the military for a few years.

08:41.930 --> 08:42.850
That's odd.

08:42.890 --> 08:43.640
What?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.020
I'm at the victim's
apartment.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.980
And there's
bedding on the couch.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.400
Like he had company.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.740
I'm in the middle of something.
I'll call you back.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.610
Wait, wait, wait.
Leslie.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.240
What were you hiding,
Brock?

09:09.550 --> 09:10.590
Ecstasy?

09:11.420 --> 09:12.760
I thought you were clean.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.640
Hood.
Meet me at the hospital.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.640
We need to talk to that girl
Kate--

09:20.680 --> 09:22.270
Who overdosed in the alley.

09:22.310 --> 09:25.900
Brock has the same ecstasy pills
at his place that she O.D.'d on.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
You good?

09:34.320 --> 09:36.200
Yeah, fine.
We gotta talk to Kate.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.450
Head upstairs
and try and find her.

09:37.490 --> 09:38.910
Let's hope she's okay
and ready to talk.

09:38.950 --> 09:40.370
She downed a load of
that drug crap.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.620
I'll check Emergency.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.910
See if anyone
wanders in with a gunshot wound.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.040
Excuse me.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.290
I'm looking
for someone.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.590
You gotta be kidding me.

09:50.630 --> 09:51.500
Doug Randell?

09:57.640 --> 09:58.800
Stop!

09:58.840 --> 09:59.890
What happened?

09:59.930 --> 10:01.600
Doug Randell happened.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.640
He's bleeding badly.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.770
Bullet hole.

10:06.810 --> 10:09.150
I guess we found
the missing slug.

10:19.490 --> 10:24.700
It's obvious that you
didn't get your brains from me.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.000
Everywhere I turn in this house,

10:26.040 --> 10:27.830
someone's shoving
a textbook in my face.

10:27.870 --> 10:28.870
How are we doing?

10:32.090 --> 10:33.250
You're my dad, Jake.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.210
We don't need to make a big
thing out of it.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.840
I'm sorry, but I just found out

10:36.880 --> 10:38.300
that I have
a sixteen year old daughter.

10:38.340 --> 10:40.010
So it's kind of a big
thing for me.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.510
You've been avoiding
me for days now.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.060
I'm fine.

10:46.770 --> 10:50.190
How long did you know Mom for?

10:55.980 --> 10:56.530
We were--

10:57.490 --> 11:00.160
We were young.
I was younger.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.570
Same age
as me, right?

11:02.490 --> 11:03.780
It's a little bit young for--

11:04.330 --> 11:05.620
You know...

11:06.200 --> 11:07.120
Don't you think?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.960
Yeah. Yes, it was. It is.

11:10.710 --> 11:13.130
Anyways. We were kids.

11:13.170 --> 11:17.340
And one day she left.
And I never saw her again.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.260
Why didn't you look for her?

11:20.220 --> 11:21.510
Try and connect with her again?

11:22.260 --> 11:23.800
You gotta understand.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.720
Your mother was an
amazing woman.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.930
She had this boyfriend.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.350
He was older.
I mean,

11:28.390 --> 11:30.810
what are the chances that
she'd go out with me, right?

11:30.850 --> 11:33.400
She was insanely pretty.
Like you.

11:34.270 --> 11:36.320
She was smart, popular.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.570
I mean, I was basically
a juvenile delinquent.

11:41.740 --> 11:43.740
So my chances were slim.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.620
Then one day she breaks
up with buddy.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.580
Whatever his name
was. And, that was my

11:48.620 --> 11:50.790
chance. I made
my move. I asked her out.

11:50.830 --> 11:53.750
And she went out with me.

11:53.790 --> 11:55.130
For how long?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.590
We dated for a bit.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.920
I was totally in love with her.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.050
But...

12:01.380 --> 12:04.970
she got back together with
the boyfriend. And--

12:05.930 --> 12:06.810
That was that.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.560
So she moves away.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.770
And sixteen years later
I show up.

12:13.150 --> 12:13.600
Surprise.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.980
I sure wish I knew about
you then.

12:17.020 --> 12:20.740
I would do anything to be able
to have been there when--

12:21.490 --> 12:22.780
to watch you grow up.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.160
To be there when you needed me.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.500
It's okay, Jake. Better late
than never, right.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.130
Am I interrupting some, like,
mother daughter bonding?

12:39.170 --> 12:40.340
Why do you have my phone?

12:40.380 --> 12:42.260
I was updating it.
You got a text.

12:44.970 --> 12:45.850
You need me to back you up?

12:46.260 --> 12:47.680
Yeah.

12:52.390 --> 12:56.440
Anyways. We've got all the time
in the world now, right?

12:57.900 --> 12:59.940
So you have fund
doing your algebra.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.660
I'll see you later.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.120
You made yourself at home.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.620
He said you authorized it, sir.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.710
Ma'am, m'om.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.670
Sergeant-- is fine.
Thanks.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.250
Constable. Can you
give us a minute?

13:20.670 --> 13:22.050
Yeah.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.300
What happened?

13:25.340 --> 13:27.260
Oh, it's what I get for
trying to play peace keeper.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.300
Broke up a fight.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.300
Seem to remember these
Newfoundland

13:29.350 --> 13:30.390
fellas being a little
kinder.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.770
Are you sure you broke up a
fight and you weren't in one.

13:34.810 --> 13:35.520
I'm fine.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.730
Babe, whatever
you're worried about.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.360
I told you
I left that behind years ago.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.230
But I did notice

13:42.280 --> 13:43.570
that you're not wearing
our wedding ring.

13:43.610 --> 13:44.490
Yeah.

13:46.740 --> 13:47.740
We can talk about that later.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.660
Constable.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.490
What do you got on our
chief suspect?

13:51.830 --> 13:54.370
Sergeant. There is
nothing coming from the unit

13:54.410 --> 13:55.870
outside Doug's place or the APB.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.040
Okay.
What do we got on Doug?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.340
[Callum] Not much.
Worked for the military

14:00.380 --> 14:02.750
for years.
Support staff.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.050
Applied for the Corp
a few times.

14:04.090 --> 14:06.670
But was denied
due to bad eyesight.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.590
Doug managed to get away
back at the hospital.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.510
But he did leave behind
his coat--

14:10.550 --> 14:11.600
with a pocket full of these.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.430
Grayson.
Did you look into them?

14:12.470 --> 14:13.680
Yeah. Turns out

14:13.720 --> 14:15.480
they're lot stickers
from a local microbrewery

14:15.520 --> 14:17.310
The Chain Rock Brewery.

14:17.350 --> 14:18.600
[Callum] That's the
odd thing, though.

14:18.650 --> 14:18.980
There's no record of Doug
ever working at brewery.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.860
Lab results from the
residue test show that there was

14:21.900 --> 14:23.190
no gunpowder on the victim--

14:23.230 --> 14:24.400
Brock Purcell's hands.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.110
So. Two guns in play.

14:26.150 --> 14:27.530
[Tinny]
Brock didn't fire either.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.820
So, we're looking for another
shooter besides Doug.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.080
Let's look into this brewery.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.000
It's not much to go on,
but--

14:36.040 --> 14:37.330
They might know where
to find Doug.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.500
Not me?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.880
We'll share information for now,
but--

14:42.920 --> 14:44.960
Let's let my officers
handle this. Okay?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.760
Okay. Are you mad at me?

14:48.130 --> 14:49.880
Don't forget. I'm not the green
little girl cop

14:49.930 --> 14:51.760
you left behind
all those years ago.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.140
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.060
Leslie.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.060
Don't say another word--

14:57.100 --> 14:59.560
Until you're ready
to come clean.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.900
Doyle. Let's go.

15:14.450 --> 15:16.120
It's Doug Randell.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.250
He does the
occasional shift for me

15:17.290 --> 15:17.790
when he's not
working on the Base.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.790
Yet, Mr. Dalton, there's
no record of that.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.380
So I can assume you were paying
him under the table.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.840
I run a small business.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.920
Sometimes we have to get
creative to keep things afloat.

15:27.050 --> 15:28.460
The arrangement worked
for both of us.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.590
Did you and Doug have any other
kinds of arrangements?

15:30.630 --> 15:31.760
[distant crash]

15:31.800 --> 15:33.300
I'm on it.

15:34.470 --> 15:36.510
No. Quite frankly,

15:36.560 --> 15:38.180
I'm surprised you think
he could have killed someone.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.350
He's a good kid.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.560
A hard worker.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.400
Thanks, Mr. Dalton.
If you see Doug--

15:44.230 --> 15:45.320
You'll call me right away.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.860
You'll be the first.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.460
Doug Randell. You need
to lower your weapon.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.370
I can't do that.

16:02.790 --> 16:03.790
I can't.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.750
I didn't kill Brock.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.340
I know you didn't kill Brock.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.960
Brock wasn't killed with
a nine millimeter.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.050
So...

16:10.090 --> 16:12.050
Let's get to the bottom
of it, okay?

16:12.090 --> 16:13.720
First, you need to
drop that.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.890
I can't.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.470
Drop it, or I'll pull my
gun and shoot you.

16:16.510 --> 16:17.970
I know what you're thinking.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.310
You got a gun pointed
directly at me, right?

16:20.350 --> 16:21.270
Yeah.

16:21.310 --> 16:22.230
Ahhh! Yes.

16:22.270 --> 16:23.560
So first off--

16:23.600 --> 16:24.940
That shoulder's getting worse.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.310
It's gonna throw your aim.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.360
Second-- I'm an
insanely good shot.

16:28.400 --> 16:28.820
-But--
-Third--

16:29.900 --> 16:31.610
My partner's got her
service weapon

16:31.650 --> 16:33.360
pointed directly at your head.

16:35.070 --> 16:35.990
So lower your gun.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.080
And put it on the ground.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.830
Or, like I said--
I'll shoot you.

16:51.670 --> 16:52.720
If that's not the murder
weapon--

16:52.760 --> 16:54.180
Doug's not our killer.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.100
But he knows who is.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.770
I always wanted to be part of
the Doyle family by human blood.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.070
Creepy.

17:09.110 --> 17:12.490
No. Not, like, as your
daughter. That would be weird.

17:12.530 --> 17:13.530
Plus Tinny and I
would be related

17:13.570 --> 17:14.610
and we wouldn't
be able to date--

17:16.160 --> 17:17.620
Other people, because,

17:17.660 --> 17:18.950
as her relative--

17:18.990 --> 17:20.790
I'd be super protective
of her suitors

17:20.830 --> 17:22.080
and I'd shoot them in the gut.

17:22.120 --> 17:22.910
[Callum]
Hey.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.830
I wanted to meet you here

17:24.870 --> 17:26.040
to tell you
to stay out of my business.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.170
I don't need you
and Leslie

17:27.210 --> 17:28.290
watching everything I do,
Okay?

17:28.330 --> 17:29.840
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.050
Come on, Jake. I know you're
telling Leslie about all this.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.170
If I wanted Leslie to find out
you're a dirtbag--

17:34.220 --> 17:35.720
punk--
Believe me--

17:35.760 --> 17:37.970
I don't want her to find
out from me.

17:38.010 --> 17:39.350
I got a feeling
she's gonna figure it out

17:39.390 --> 17:40.810
all on her own anyways.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.270
[door opens]

17:50.900 --> 17:51.860
Keep the car running.

17:51.900 --> 17:52.860
What are you
doing here?

17:52.900 --> 17:53.820
Shut up.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.610
Hey. I remember you.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.700
[punch]

17:59.280 --> 18:00.580
I owed you that.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.700
What's in the tickle
trunk there?

18:02.740 --> 18:04.120
I mean if it's a present
for me, buddy--

18:04.160 --> 18:06.160
You should know that I
got everything I need.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.130
Callum here owe me twenty
five thousand.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.040
And I'm gonna get it
one way or another.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.340
I don't like
the sound of that.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.300
Oooh.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.340
Good looking wife.

18:16.380 --> 18:17.840
Seriously. She's hot.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.180
Cop too.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.430
You leave her out of this.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.220
Come on now, b'ys.
Every one just--

18:24.100 --> 18:26.730
Why don't we all just relax?
Alright.

18:26.770 --> 18:29.860
I'll get ye two a couple of
beers. What do you say?

18:31.480 --> 18:32.400
You like Gallos?

18:32.440 --> 18:33.400
[crunch]

18:33.440 --> 18:35.030
[smash]

18:36.400 --> 18:37.280
What are you doing?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.580
You think this changes
anything?

18:42.620 --> 18:43.910
Now why don't you
take it easy

18:43.950 --> 18:45.450
before you do something
you can't undo.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.290
You're the one who's gonna
need to be taking it easy--

18:47.330 --> 18:48.620
In your face.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.300
Wait. Wait.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.340
What do you
want from us?

18:57.010 --> 18:58.050
I offered bucko here

18:58.090 --> 19:00.090
an opportunity
to pay down his debt.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.260
And he refused.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.760
I changed my mind, alright.
I'll do it.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.390
You see Cal-- I can't trust you
anymore. It's too late.

19:06.430 --> 19:07.600
But Jakey here--

19:07.640 --> 19:09.230
I got a good
feeling about.

19:09.270 --> 19:10.810
Yeah? What makes you think
I'm gonna help you?

19:10.850 --> 19:11.810
Either you do--

19:12.940 --> 19:15.820
Or something bad
happens to his cop wife.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.490
A simple drop off.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.660
Do not look
in the trunk.

19:20.700 --> 19:21.990
I'll text you an address.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.370
You got two hours
to make the delivery.

19:23.410 --> 19:25.740
If you don't--
Well...

19:25.790 --> 19:27.450
Let's just hope for Leslie
Bennett's welfare,

19:28.290 --> 19:30.080
that that
won't happen.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.170
I don't need your help.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.180
Don't say another word.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.850
You stay out of it.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.560
We'll take care of this.
Now get out.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.020
[Leslie] We know your gun--

19:54.060 --> 19:55.150
isn't the murder weapon.

19:55.190 --> 19:56.570
And I don't believe
you killed Brock.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.530
Someone shot at you
in that alley.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.820
We got the evidence, Doug.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.820
What if I was there?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.280
I was drunk.
I didn't see nudding.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.490
Stop lying.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.410
You saw a lot.

20:08.450 --> 20:11.250
And we know you shot back
with your nine millimetre.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.710
The bullet we pulled
out of that wall?

20:12.750 --> 20:13.830
It matches your gun.

20:15.460 --> 20:19.590
We got an eye witness that saw
you and Brock arguing earlier.

20:19.630 --> 20:20.840
Why were you fighting?

20:20.880 --> 20:21.970
Was it over the drugs?

20:24.180 --> 20:24.680
I want a lawyer.

20:25.970 --> 20:28.010
Just because I don't believe
you killed Brock,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.270
doesn't mean you won't go
down for accessory to murder.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.600
I would think on that.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.240
He knows who shot Brock.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.490
He's either
protecting him--

20:43.530 --> 20:45.370
Or he's afraid of what
they might do to him.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.830
I'm sorry about earlier.

20:48.490 --> 20:52.580
Brock being killed is setting
off some serious cop instincts.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.080
And I guess I'm
seeing everything.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.580
Whether it's there or not.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.170
It's cool. Just--

20:58.960 --> 21:00.010
I understand.

21:01.630 --> 21:03.260
Shall we forget about it?

21:03.300 --> 21:04.180
Yeah.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.640
Leslie--

21:09.810 --> 21:10.810
Let's just stay on our toes

21:10.850 --> 21:12.930
until this whole
thing is over, okay?

21:15.520 --> 21:16.440
Yeah.

21:20.690 --> 21:21.980
We got something.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.990
It's the footage from the
alleyway outside the bar.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.370
That's Doug.

21:28.410 --> 21:29.370
Who's he arguing with?

21:32.950 --> 21:34.210
[Leslie]
That's Brock.

21:35.120 --> 21:35.960
Stop it there.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.040
The shootout started before
Brock ever was in the alley.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.460
He was just checking
out the scene.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.210
Brock wasn't the target.
Doug was.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.300
That explains why
he's not talking.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.010
Does this mean the drugs
you found at Brock's place

21:47.050 --> 21:48.800
aren't related to the shooting?

21:48.840 --> 21:50.300
It turns out that Brock
wasn't even using.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.390
His tox screen
came clean.

21:51.430 --> 21:53.020
There are a lot of pills
in the place.

21:53.060 --> 21:55.140
Just because he wasn't using,
doesn't mean he wasn't dealing.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.270
I woulda known if he was.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.650
I still think these drugs are
connected somehow.

21:59.690 --> 22:02.190
And I know who we
need to talk to.

22:02.230 --> 22:03.150
Listen, hey.

22:03.190 --> 22:04.820
You guys got this?

22:04.860 --> 22:06.240
I gotta follow up
on another lead.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.160
Yeah.
Of course.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.080
Great.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.540
Is this the guy
that sold you the drugs?

22:19.210 --> 22:21.000
I didn't do any drugs.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.840
In case you didn't notice,
Kate, you're in the hospital.

22:24.460 --> 22:25.720
Yeah.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.800
You coulda ended up
in the morgue,

22:26.840 --> 22:27.970
if it wasn't for
Sergeant Bennett.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.140
Constable, give us a minute?

22:33.390 --> 22:35.140
We're not here to bust you.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.640
People make mistakes.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.730
It's what they do about them
that matters.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.400
Thank you for saving me.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.900
My life.

22:46.650 --> 22:48.570
I got this stuff from
a bartender.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.780
I don't remember much more.
But--

22:53.530 --> 22:55.000
I know it was a woman.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.330
Is this her?

23:03.710 --> 23:05.340
Thank you.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.430
[ringing]

23:09.180 --> 23:10.470
What are you at?
Dad?

23:10.510 --> 23:11.590
Yeah, listen.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.260
I need you to run
a name for me.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.390
Ray Maddox.

23:14.430 --> 23:16.720
I didn't know we were
working a case.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.390
Just do it, would you,
please.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.400
He's not too old for
a boot in the arse.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.730
Jake, there could be anything
in that crate.

23:25.770 --> 23:28.860
You know, there could be a bomb.
There could be a horse's head.

23:28.900 --> 23:29.990
There could be a bomb and
a horse's head!

23:30.030 --> 23:31.360
Pull over!
Pull over!

23:31.410 --> 23:33.240
Relax, okay.
We gotta follow this through.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.200
I need to figure out whatever
the hell Callum is up to.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.290
Callum? What do you care about
Callum? He stole your girl--

23:39.410 --> 23:43.500
--ish looks. He stole your
girlish looks. Forget it.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.170
I don't care about Callum.
This is about Leslie.

23:46.630 --> 23:48.340
I wanna make sure she doesn't
get dragged into this.

23:48.380 --> 23:49.590
[Des] You know Jake,
you're a good guy.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.300
And Sloan's really lucky
to have you as a father.

23:51.340 --> 23:54.090
But maybe you should start
driving more dad-like, okay?

23:54.140 --> 23:55.810
And not getting so many
speeding tickets.

23:55.850 --> 23:57.260
Now. What's our next move?

23:57.310 --> 23:58.890
We gotta figure out whatever
the hell's in that crate.

23:58.930 --> 23:59.770
But unfortunately,

24:00.520 --> 24:02.440
I think we got a tail.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.360
What?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.570
That's Ray's guys.
What are they doing?

24:06.610 --> 24:08.230
They wanna make sure we deliver,
probably.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.570
Yeah, but why doesn't
he just do it?

24:09.610 --> 24:10.280
Why doesn't he get
his boys to do the drop?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.700
Why are we doing this?

24:11.740 --> 24:13.570
I don't know, Des! Maybe he
doesn't wanna get caught.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.540
I think I got a way to
lose them.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.910
The manager says Melissa
took the recycling out

24:19.950 --> 24:20.870
ten minutes ago.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.960
Leslie. When I was running
the security tapes,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.460
I accessed the weather
stations for the area.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.630
They all got cameras.

24:29.670 --> 24:30.880
Good. So...

24:30.920 --> 24:32.010
So, there's something
on one of the tapes

24:32.050 --> 24:33.220
I think you need to see.

24:33.260 --> 24:35.680
It has Callum and Jake on it.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.560
Callum was fighting
with some guys.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.560
Jake actually tried
to break it up.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.190
[Leslie]
Oh no. Melissa.

24:49.860 --> 24:50.940
She's dead.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.410
They're still on us.

24:58.450 --> 25:00.040
[Jake]
I know. We're almost there.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.000
What are you talking about?
We'er nowhere near

25:01.040 --> 25:02.000
the address he gave us.

25:02.040 --> 25:02.910
[ringing]

25:02.960 --> 25:03.620
What do you got?

25:03.660 --> 25:05.000
This Ray Maddox

25:05.040 --> 25:06.790
is much more than your
run of the mill loan shark.

25:06.830 --> 25:07.710
What does that mean?

25:07.750 --> 25:09.130
[Rose] He's known as a guy

25:09.170 --> 25:12.010
who can get anything at any
time for the right price.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.180
So whatever you're doing with
this guy, be careful.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.680
You got big
responsibilities now.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.510
And my days of raising
problematic kids are over.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.720
Okay. Good to know.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.310
[Des] Jake. Jake.

25:23.350 --> 25:24.270
This is a forty
zone.

25:24.310 --> 25:25.480
Yeah, I know.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.850
Cop, Jake!

25:26.900 --> 25:28.480
How do you think I got
those tickets?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.190
[siren]

25:45.500 --> 25:46.460
Nice. Nice work.
Now what?

25:47.920 --> 25:50.000
Now we find out whatever the
hell we got in our trunk.

25:51.590 --> 25:54.970
This feels like a city record
for dead people on one day.

25:55.010 --> 25:57.640
Let along two people that are
killed with the same gun.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.550
What ?

25:59.930 --> 26:02.100
If you insist on my doing
your forensics analysis

26:02.140 --> 26:03.430
without me telling forensics
that I'm doing it,

26:04.730 --> 26:07.310
you're gonna have to sign off
on the overtime.

26:07.350 --> 26:08.440
You help me sign off
on this thing,

26:08.480 --> 26:09.480
I'll get you whatever you want.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.770
Consider me bribed.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.770
So--

26:11.820 --> 26:13.190
Bullet. Close range.

26:13.230 --> 26:14.820
Same caliber that killed
Brock over there.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.070
Thirty eight.

26:16.110 --> 26:18.070
And the one we pulled out
of Doug's shoulder.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.490
And your educated guess says
it was the same gun?

26:22.120 --> 26:24.870
My educated guess is that the
bodies that show up down here

26:24.910 --> 26:26.710
are usually connected to drugs.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.670
I know Brock was clean, but--

26:28.710 --> 26:30.000
You're right.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.000
Melissa was pushing the same
type of ecstasy that

26:32.040 --> 26:32.300
we found
in Brock's apartment.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.050
And I got a feeling that's what
Brock wanted to talk to me about

26:36.090 --> 26:37.260
before he was killed.

26:37.300 --> 26:39.640
Well--
There's your answer.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.300
If you're sure Brock was clean,

26:42.350 --> 26:44.560
and he was angry at Melissa
for selling--

26:44.600 --> 26:47.980
Maybe whoever killed
Melissa and Brock--

26:48.020 --> 26:49.730
Did so to keep them quiet.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.060
They woulda known the supplier.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.900
If this works out, I want many
drinks paid for by you.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.320
Yes b'y.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.490
And don't be afraid to send
me that Jake Doyle too.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.570
I mean, if you're
finished with him.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.330
We'll see about the drinks.

27:07.210 --> 27:07.330
Sergeant.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.790
Someone didn't want Melissa
telling us

27:09.830 --> 27:11.040
who's behind this ecstasy ring.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.380
So what's our next step?

27:13.420 --> 27:14.500
We need to talk to
Doug again.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.170
He holds the key
to all of this.

27:16.210 --> 27:17.840
Maybe this second murder
will get him talking.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.390
Whatever's on that tape--

27:21.430 --> 27:22.510
I wanna see it.

27:22.550 --> 27:23.550
You got me?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.640
I didn't show it
to anyone else.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.100
Okay.

27:26.140 --> 27:27.270
Hey, boss.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.230
Doug was released an hour ago.

27:29.270 --> 27:30.770
Why wasn't I notified?

27:30.810 --> 27:32.650
A high priced lawyer came in
and out. Happened in minutes.

27:32.690 --> 27:34.020
The guy was better than
Danny Williams.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.110
Where'd he get the money

27:36.150 --> 27:37.990
to hire the best
criminal law firm in the city?

27:38.030 --> 27:39.150
I'll find out.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.400
I know a judge who might
have some answers.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.410
Okay. You two track down Doug.

27:42.450 --> 27:44.990
Now that he's out there,
he's an easy target.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.250
What are you trying to
tell me Brock?

28:01.220 --> 28:02.800
A U.V. flashlight?

28:17.730 --> 28:18.150
Gotcha.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.950
But Doug had the beer
lot stickers.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.630
Tinny.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.170
I gotta look into something.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.800
But I need you and Grayson to
stake out Brock's apartment.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.470
Doug was crashing here.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.260
And he's gonna be back.

28:53.310 --> 28:54.730
Alright. Look.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.070
If there's a head in there...

28:58.400 --> 29:00.690
I'm gonna lose my poo.
Alright? I'm just saying.

29:00.730 --> 29:03.610
Just keep whatever's inside you,
inside you, and open the trunk.

29:07.950 --> 29:08.910
What is it?

29:08.950 --> 29:10.290
Whoa! Don't touch it, Des.

29:10.330 --> 29:11.450
Read the label.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.410
It's acid.

29:12.450 --> 29:15.290
Here, I gotta make a call.

29:17.170 --> 29:18.590
[Grayson] By the way, congrats

29:18.630 --> 29:20.250
on winning the gold
medal in the Regatta.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.510
You look good rowing too.

29:22.590 --> 29:23.630
It was hot.

29:24.470 --> 29:25.260
Thank you.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.390
How are things
with you and Daz?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.520
Des. Fine.

29:34.480 --> 29:34.890
Look, I--

29:36.310 --> 29:39.770
I know you and I are in
the past now. I know that.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.320
I'm just saying that
sometimes it can be difficult

29:42.360 --> 29:47.110
to make that transition from
friendship to relationship.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.990
Thanks for that deep,
meaningful advice, cocky.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.960
It's Doug.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.920
Leslie was right.
He's back for his stash.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.710
Sergeant? Doug just
entered Brock's house.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.050
Doug wants the drugs
he hid in the fridge.

30:03.090 --> 30:04.590
What do you want us to do?

30:04.630 --> 30:06.720
Keep an eye on him, but don't
make move until I get there.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.140
The drugs are gone.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.890
But he's gonna tear the
place up looking for them.

30:09.930 --> 30:10.560
Don't worry. He's not
going anywhere.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.600
And get this.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.390
The law firm that bailed out
Doug was hired by John Dalton.

30:15.430 --> 30:16.770
The brewery owner?

30:16.810 --> 30:18.190
[Grayson] Yeah, and it
didn't come cheap.

30:18.230 --> 30:20.110
Which makes you wonder how a
struggling business owner

30:20.150 --> 30:22.070
was able to raise
that kind of capital.

30:27.820 --> 30:28.910
[Leslie]
Yeah.

30:28.950 --> 30:30.530
I think I know how
Dalton got the cash.

30:30.570 --> 30:34.040
He's shipping the drugs in kegs
marked with an ecstasy stamp.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.080
That's why we saw Doug
at the brewery.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.920
He was looking for more stash.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.040
Dalton's a supplier.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.330
We don't have enough evidence.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.340
Dalton could pin
all this on Doug

30:42.380 --> 30:43.300
or Melissa.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.800
I'll be there in a sec.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.220
Go.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.850
Doug.

30:52.890 --> 30:53.970
You gotta come with me.

30:54.010 --> 30:56.100
My lawyer got me out.
So back off.

30:56.890 --> 30:57.690
Gun!

30:58.190 --> 30:59.400
[gunshots]

31:11.820 --> 31:13.450
Someone shot at me.
Again.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.620
So why am I in here?

31:15.660 --> 31:17.750
You should be out there looking
for whoever did this.

31:17.790 --> 31:19.710
Come on, Doug. You
know who did this.

31:19.750 --> 31:21.130
Let's not start running around
in circles here.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.710
What? No.

31:22.750 --> 31:23.880
Sure you do.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.420
We know what happened
in that alley.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.050
You were there to meet
your supplier,

31:27.090 --> 31:31.050
who was pretty angry at you for
skimming some of the product.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.890
Which you stashed in
Brock's refrigerator.

31:33.930 --> 31:35.260
That's crazy.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.350
How could I do that?

31:36.390 --> 31:38.730
We know you were staying there.

31:38.770 --> 31:41.310
Brock was your sponsor,
wasn't he?

31:42.270 --> 31:44.270
He tried to help you get clean.

31:44.310 --> 31:45.480
And that's what you two
were fighting about

31:45.520 --> 31:46.400
just before Brock was killed.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.690
Wait.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.950
Brock walked right
in the middle of a shootout

31:49.990 --> 31:52.070
between you
and a supplier, John Dalton.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.490
He killed Melissa

31:53.530 --> 31:55.830
because he was worried
she was gonna lead us to him.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.290
And he tried to finish you off

31:57.330 --> 31:58.830
and he nearly took out
Sergeant Bennett here.

31:58.870 --> 32:01.870
And I happen to like Sergeant
Bennett very much, Doug.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.090
Look. I remember you
from the Base.

32:07.130 --> 32:07.300
You're a good fella.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.260
I know you were a contract
worker, but you

32:10.300 --> 32:12.510
always had that
soldier's mentality.

32:12.550 --> 32:14.260
Now, come on.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.770
I didn't plan on any of this.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.480
I just got messed up
in the drugs.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.770
Brock tried to help me,
but I just kept relapsing.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.360
Brock was a good guy.

32:30.530 --> 32:32.200
He'd want you to do the
right thing now.

32:34.070 --> 32:37.450
Dalton is the supplier.

32:37.490 --> 32:38.790
He killed Brock.

32:38.830 --> 32:40.330
And Melissa.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.460
I'll testify against Dalton.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.000
I'll tell everything I know.

32:50.590 --> 32:51.550
[Jake]
What are you at, Ray?

32:51.590 --> 32:52.510
How's it going?

32:52.550 --> 32:53.470
Not so good.

32:54.550 --> 32:56.550
My guy didn't get his package.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.600
And then my boys got
pulled over.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.890
And subsequently arrested
for outstanding warrants.

33:00.930 --> 33:02.940
See you gotta really screen
your staff.

33:02.980 --> 33:03.390
Please don't screen me,
okay?

33:04.520 --> 33:05.610
I guess you don't like
that pretty cop.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.690
I thought she was your
girlfriend or something.

33:10.150 --> 33:14.070
Tell you what. I got another
deal to offer you.

33:14.110 --> 33:14.990
Hood!

33:16.820 --> 33:18.070
Ray Maddox.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.740
I got a couple of questions
for you downtown.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.460
Looks like your boys we picked
up were in a talking mood.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.910
Burn. You see?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.620
See what I was talking
about screening your staff.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.960
It was a long time ago. It was
a small thing involving--

33:29.840 --> 33:31.500
Hood. Can I have him for
a second, please?

33:31.550 --> 33:33.380
And promise me you won't tell
Leslie about any of this.

33:34.130 --> 33:35.510
You have twenty seconds.

33:37.050 --> 33:38.850
Alright. You tell me right now

33:38.890 --> 33:39.810
that you will not
hurt Leslie Bennett--

33:41.350 --> 33:43.520
And I won't tell the cops
about the barrel of acid I have

33:43.560 --> 33:44.690
stashed in my truck.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.270
Alright.

33:46.900 --> 33:46.940
Not to be a tool--

33:48.310 --> 33:49.820
But this is what happens
when you try to call in

33:49.860 --> 33:50.980
on an eight year old debt.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.070
Eight years. What are
you talking about?

33:53.190 --> 33:55.280
He took out that loan
two weeks ago.

33:56.410 --> 33:57.740
What did you say?

33:57.780 --> 34:00.620
You're buddy Callum's into
a whole mess of things.

34:00.660 --> 34:01.870
You want my advice, Jake?

34:01.910 --> 34:03.660
You steer clear of him.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.870
That's free advice.

34:15.010 --> 34:16.220
You know, I gotta say,

34:16.260 --> 34:17.640
this parental
thing is really working for you.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.010
But, side note--

34:21.060 --> 34:22.430
Why are we doing this?

34:22.470 --> 34:24.430
I mean the cops already have
Ray. It's all good right.

34:24.470 --> 34:26.730
Look. Whatever Callum was
tangled up in--

34:26.770 --> 34:28.730
I just wanna make sure
that Leslie's safe.

34:28.770 --> 34:29.980
Yeah, I know. I just gotta
tell you, Jake.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.190
If he is,
it's pretty serious.

34:31.230 --> 34:32.900
'Cause hydrochloric
acid has a number of--

34:32.940 --> 34:34.820
applications for dissolving
unwanted items.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.650
Like human bodies,
for example.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.950
[Jake] It's also a precursor
in the making of drugs.

34:42.990 --> 34:44.490
You don't think
that Callum's involved

34:44.540 --> 34:46.410
in any kind of
drug ring, do you?

34:46.460 --> 34:47.790
No b'y.

34:47.830 --> 34:48.750
Wow man.

34:48.790 --> 34:50.170
Look at all this gear!

34:50.210 --> 34:51.210
Des, keep it down.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.590
What are you doing?

34:52.630 --> 34:53.550
Hey.

34:53.590 --> 34:54.380
No worries. Just--

34:54.880 --> 34:56.300
Stay calm, okay.

34:56.340 --> 34:58.760
We're here to make a delivery
on behalf of Ray Maddox.

35:03.510 --> 35:04.560
Open it.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.680
Des. Can I get a hand?

35:27.790 --> 35:28.750
Alright. Come on.
Come on!

35:28.790 --> 35:30.170
See?

35:30.210 --> 35:31.290
There you go.
It's all good.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.750
Hold it.

35:33.670 --> 35:34.630
Jake?

35:34.670 --> 35:36.630
Drop the gun.
Or the kid's dead.

35:36.670 --> 35:37.590
Des.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.300
Just stay calm.

35:39.340 --> 35:41.510
We know you killed Brock
and Melissa.

35:41.550 --> 35:42.760
No one else needs to get hurt.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.350
Yeah. Especially me.
Or Tinny.

35:44.390 --> 35:45.970
Just don't hurt Tinny.

35:46.020 --> 35:46.930
Shut up Des.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.270
Yes. Des. Shut up.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.190
You.

35:50.230 --> 35:51.480
Give me the drum.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.150
Okay.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.950
Why don't you lower your
gun a little.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.370
So that there aren't
any accidents.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.200
We'll do the same.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.210
Arrgh!

36:13.250 --> 36:14.540
[gunshot]

36:21.970 --> 36:23.470
Thirty eight calibre.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.350
It's the murder weapon.

36:26.890 --> 36:29.140
John Dalton is going down
for the murder of Brock Purcell

36:29.180 --> 36:30.850
and Melissa Hartley.

36:30.890 --> 36:32.440
Congratulations.

36:33.230 --> 36:34.310
Yeah.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.190
Listen. We should talk.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.490
No. I saw the weather
station tape.

36:42.490 --> 36:44.320
I saw that you saved Callum.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.490
And Hood told me you had him
take down Ray Maddox.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.330
Callum always had a dark streak.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.330
He always managed to find
himself in trouble.

36:53.370 --> 36:54.330
I just--

36:55.250 --> 36:57.420
chose to forget it.
I guess.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.170
I'm sorry.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.680
So what now?

37:03.340 --> 37:04.720
I don't know.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.600
Honestly I don't.

37:07.890 --> 37:10.850
He's my husband. That
should mean something.

37:16.350 --> 37:19.610
Do not feel obligated,
just because of that.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.530
Obviously,
I'm the last person in the world

37:22.570 --> 37:24.320
that should be giving you
this kind of advice.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.580
But still.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.290
I'll see ya later.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.250
Let's go.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.880
So. Are you okay?

37:39.920 --> 37:42.470
Yeah. We switched the acid with
water before we got here.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.340
Why did you scream?

37:44.880 --> 37:45.890
Effect.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.060
I'll see you later.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.560
What is that?

38:08.160 --> 38:09.740
[Callum]
Hey.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.290
I know Brock was an informant.

38:15.330 --> 38:16.460
But he was also your friend.

38:17.330 --> 38:19.540
I'm so sorry about all this,

38:20.540 --> 38:21.670
Yeah.

38:23.090 --> 38:26.970
I gotta tell you. I really
enjoyed working together.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.720
How much money do you
owe Ray Maddox?

38:34.470 --> 38:37.140
Good. Don't answer me. I don't
wanna know any details.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.400
Okay. Obviously Jake Doyle is
spreading a bunch of lies.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.230
He trying
to break us apart.

38:42.270 --> 38:44.030
No, actually, the police
officers I work with

38:44.070 --> 38:46.490
told me about Ray Maddox.

38:46.530 --> 38:48.240
And I saw the security footage

38:48.280 --> 38:50.280
of Jake saving your ass
from being handed to you

38:50.320 --> 38:51.990
by a bunch of thugs.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.040
It's not what you think.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.830
What is it, Callum?

38:54.870 --> 38:55.540
Tell me.

38:56.870 --> 38:58.920
You working some secret case
with the military?

38:58.960 --> 39:00.920
Fighting skeety loan sharks?

39:00.960 --> 39:05.460
Boy. This reunion didn't go
the way I'd hoped.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.930
I gotta tell you, I feel
like an idiot.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.720
Two months with you.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.390
And suddenly I'm
transported back

39:13.430 --> 39:15.680
into the body of a dumb,
little naive girl--

39:15.720 --> 39:17.520
who'll believe anything
you tell her.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.400
I see.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.520
Okay.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.940
Obviously you've made
up your mind.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.110
So I'm convicted without
a jury or judge.

39:25.150 --> 39:26.150
That's--

39:26.190 --> 39:27.570
Look me in in the eye
and tell me

39:27.610 --> 39:30.320
you're not involved in
a shitload of illegal garbage.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.410
I'm not!

39:35.740 --> 39:39.540
Something you never realized
about me all these years.

39:40.870 --> 39:42.290
It blows my mind.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.800
What is that?

39:44.840 --> 39:46.130
I always knew--

39:46.170 --> 39:47.760
when you lied to me.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.670
Every time.

39:50.470 --> 39:51.590
But I loved you.

39:52.760 --> 39:56.350
And I chose to pretend
it wasn't true.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.640
I'm not pretending anymore.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.940
Go.

40:04.980 --> 40:08.570
Make sure you don't come back
from the dead again.

40:25.630 --> 40:26.960
Great work today.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.420
Really.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.050
Thanks. You too.

40:32.880 --> 40:33.760
Peace offering.

40:35.510 --> 40:36.720
I should be the one buying.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.720
You spotted the
shooter. I didn't.

40:39.770 --> 40:43.100
Well, if you're trying to
swell my head, It's working.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.940
Hey, I know--

40:45.980 --> 40:49.190
I know you're with someone.

40:49.230 --> 40:52.150
But, you wanna get outta here?

40:54.030 --> 41:00.870
Okay. I'm sorry. I totally get
it. Outta bounds. I apologize.

41:01.870 --> 41:05.080
No. Look. It's okay.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.890
Thanks for the drink.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.480
So. Congrats to you guys.
You solved a big one.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.770
Yeah.

41:27.810 --> 41:28.730
You seen Bennett?

41:28.770 --> 41:32.110
No. Look who's here?

41:32.150 --> 41:33.650
Jake Doyle.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.660
My cue.

41:35.700 --> 41:37.580
Doyle kills a good buzz
pretty quick like.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.250
I'm glad you're here.
Let's get this party started.

41:42.290 --> 41:43.540
Wow.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.830
Um... have you--

41:44.870 --> 41:46.420
So what's your plan for tonight?

41:46.460 --> 41:48.420
Taking on the town?
Or what?

41:50.090 --> 41:52.050
I'm looking for Leslie.
Is she here?

41:52.090 --> 41:53.460
No.

41:53.510 --> 41:56.260
Likely locked in at home with
that husband of hers.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.180
Yeah.

42:01.350 --> 42:02.680
If you're on the go later,

42:02.720 --> 42:04.850
a group of us are
heading down to Greensleeves.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.810
And then later on
we'll be at the Sundance. So--

42:08.860 --> 42:10.150
Cool.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.610
Text me.
