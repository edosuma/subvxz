WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:05.048
Why do we have a damn bell?!

00:05.092 --> 00:06.832
This is a college!

00:06.876 --> 00:08.486
Sorry I'm late.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.619
The dean is getting
his ass kicked

00:10.662 --> 00:11.968
in the parking lot.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.450
It's so messed up.
Nobody is stopping to help.

00:15.493 --> 00:18.322
Yeesh. So this is old
Corpsey herself, huh?

00:18.366 --> 00:19.497
Ugh!

00:19.541 --> 00:21.108
What'd,
they leave her out in the sun?

00:21.151 --> 00:22.718
Aah!

00:22.761 --> 00:25.199
Oh, I didn't miss anything,
did I?

00:25.242 --> 00:27.288
I was just trying
to catch a little catnap

00:27.331 --> 00:29.072
before class started.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.118
G-G-G-G-G-Going on is what?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.728
Hayley, this is
our new lab partner.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.208
She's a SNAB.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.645
A Student of Notable Age
or Background.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.299
And her name's Anus.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.431
Eunice.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.433
Yahh!

00:42.477 --> 00:44.305
Dammit!

00:44.348 --> 00:46.785
Wow. 98 years old,

00:46.829 --> 00:48.961
and you're going
back to college.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.486
You're never too old
to follow your dreams.

00:51.529 --> 00:54.097
I find that so inspiring.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.578
I'll tell you
what I find inspiring.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.102
The student bodies.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.586
Sweet Georgia Brown.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.676
I happen to have an interest
in the fellas <i>and</i> the gals.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.896
Daaamn, old lady!

01:26.825 --> 01:29.437
Ooh, ooh, and another thing
about my new friend Eunice...

01:29.480 --> 01:32.222
another thing is,
she is so funny.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.137
Check out
this hilarious picture of us

01:34.181 --> 01:36.008
pretending to hump
the tope-liary animals

01:36.052 --> 01:37.292
out front
of the Women's Center.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.537
You didn't tell us
she was an old age person.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.974
Barf City,
population no thank you.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.323
Now, Francine,

01:46.367 --> 01:49.152
I too was once put off
by old people,

01:49.196 --> 01:51.111
but then I had
an adventure about them

01:51.154 --> 01:52.721
that changed my mind.

01:52.764 --> 01:53.983
I'm always having adventures

01:54.026 --> 01:56.377
and learning
life-changing lessons from them.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.641
This week, I'm converting
our mud room into a man cave.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.296
I wonder what I'll learn
from that.

02:02.339 --> 02:05.560
Well, I say,
"Go young or go home."

02:05.603 --> 02:07.257
No old-o.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.652
Well, I think Eunice is
a deeply inspirational SNAB.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.133
And I hope I'm just like her
when I get old.

02:13.176 --> 02:16.745
Oh, you're not going
to be like Eunice.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.443
You're going to be
like... your mom.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.010
Pff.
Sha-yeah-hah right.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.533
It's fate.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.927
Every woman eventually
becomes her mother.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.798
- Will I become my mother?
- No.

02:26.842 --> 02:29.192
Every man <i>marries
his mother.</i>

02:29.236 --> 02:30.628
Noice.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.152
Hayley, think of all the ways

02:32.195 --> 02:34.110
you're already like Francine.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.068
Laid-back, except
for quick bursts of anger.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.374
Lazy.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.984
Heavy substance abuse.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.464
For you, weed.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.858
For Francine, collectible <i>
Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

02:42.901 --> 02:44.642
Big Gulp cups
full of white wine.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.210
You should consider
yourself lucky, Hayley.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.908
This is Francine
we're talking about here.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.606
I'm an icon.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.260
I'm sorry,
but me become like you?

02:53.303 --> 02:55.087
Gross.

02:55.131 --> 02:58.482
It's like, Barf City,
population no thank you.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.049
Oh, see, right there?

03:00.092 --> 03:01.722
Francine just said that
like two minutes ago!

03:01.746 --> 03:03.226
No, she didn't. <i>
Barf City,</i>

03:03.270 --> 03:04.793
<i>population no thank you.</i>

03:04.836 --> 03:06.969
Roger, why were
you recording us?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.797
I'm recording everything
these days.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.929
I'm afraid
the political atmosphere

03:10.973 --> 03:13.497
inside my improv team,
Pizza Party Weekend,

03:13.541 --> 03:15.543
has me... a bit paranoid.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.066
There's snakes in the grass.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.286
Certain members want me out.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.678
- Which ones?
- All of them.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.679
Every single one of them.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.334
Well, Hayley, too bad for you

03:24.378 --> 03:26.336
that you're gonna end up
being like me,

03:26.380 --> 03:28.730
whether you like it or not.

03:28.773 --> 03:31.689
Now, I see it's time
for my 10:00 AM nap, so...

03:31.733 --> 03:33.343
Ugh!
Here comes another one

03:33.387 --> 03:35.954
of your obnoxious
little sayings.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.869
Give Momma some sugar

03:37.913 --> 03:41.351
so she can have
them sweet dreams.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.483
Ugh!

03:42.526 --> 03:43.962
Barfsylvania...

03:44.006 --> 03:46.443
Population nothankyula.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.532
Aah!

03:55.147 --> 03:58.847
Oh! You don't have
a big squiggly mustache!

03:58.890 --> 04:00.979
For the last time, Jeff,
we are listing the ways

04:01.023 --> 04:03.504
I am different from my mom,
not Wario.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.245
Oh, Hayley!

04:05.288 --> 04:08.204
Looky what I found
in the old picture album.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.598
You can barely tell us apart.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.339
Yeah, only because
you were always trying

04:12.382 --> 04:15.298
to make me a frilly, princessy
little clone of yourself.

04:15.342 --> 04:19.041
Oh, excuse me for ever trying
to bond with my daughter.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.999
Bond?! Ha!

04:21.043 --> 04:22.958
You just wanted
your own personal Mini-Me.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.090
Like that Halloween
that you went as Mini-Me

04:25.134 --> 04:26.875
and you made me go
as Mini-Mini-Me.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.096
But I didn't wanna be Mini-Me.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.750
I wanted
to be Minnie Mouse.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.839
Or at least Mini-Minnie Mouse.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.277
But that's what Dad and Steve
got to go as!

04:38.930 --> 04:40.280
But it's okay.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.630
Because I couldn't be
more different from you.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.196
Oh, yeah?

04:44.240 --> 04:48.418
Why don't you check
my old senior picture?

04:48.462 --> 04:49.854
You...

04:49.898 --> 04:51.334
wore a headband, too?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.118
Face it, Hayley.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.773
There's too much of me
in you already.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.297
My genes.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.733
My cooking.

04:58.776 --> 05:01.039
My double-jointedness.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.127
You're double-jointed?

05:02.171 --> 05:03.694
Yes.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.654
And so are you!

05:09.004 --> 05:12.529
Toodle-oo, Future Me!

05:12.573 --> 05:15.010
Well, Steve,
through ruthless cunning,

05:15.053 --> 05:17.317
I seized control
of Pizza Party Weekend

05:17.360 --> 05:18.927
and fired all the other members.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.972
Had to be done.
It was a nest of vipers.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.714
A den of... vipers.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.108
Plus, none of them
could do characters for crap.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.892
But now I gotta find
a whole new team!

05:27.936 --> 05:29.981
What about me and my friends?

05:30.025 --> 05:32.854
Our drunk driving skit
got big laughs

05:32.897 --> 05:34.508
at the pre-prom assembly
last year.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.466
Hmm.
How was the prom?

05:36.510 --> 05:37.511
It was a bloodbath.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.121
Drunk driving was way up.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.644
I don't know.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.342
Maybe we could do
a trial practice,

05:42.385 --> 05:44.735
test the chemistry,
play a little Splooch Magooch.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.477
What's that?
Classic improv warm-up game.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.784
You don't know Splooch Magooch?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.307
Oh, my God.
This is not gonna work.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.656
No way.
But I'm up against it.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.310
You're in.
All of you.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.114
Full member status.
Welcome to the big leagues.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.835
We practice in a public park.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.447
Gotta get rid of my headbands.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.623
No, wait!
Mom got rid of hers!

06:02.666 --> 06:04.407
But does that mean
I need to keep mine?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
CannisterCo?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.019
That's Mom's brand!

06:11.240 --> 06:12.589
Babe?

06:12.633 --> 06:14.243
Are you all right?

06:14.286 --> 06:17.551
No, Jeff! I am definitely not
all right!

06:17.594 --> 06:19.683
I have to get rid of anything
related to my mom!

06:19.727 --> 06:22.207
What about that dress?

06:40.051 --> 06:42.619
I hereby sentence you
to become...

06:42.663 --> 06:45.709
your mother!

06:48.886 --> 06:50.410
If you just had a nightmare,

06:50.453 --> 06:51.933
please don't tell me about it.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.109
No need for both of us
to get scared.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.720
Wait a minute.
That's it.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.244
A way I'm not anything
like my mom.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.594
You.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.465
Oh, she would never marry
someone like you.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.119
Almost nobody would.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.816
Ah, thanks, babe.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.689
I'm not becoming my mother.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.212
I'm glad, too.

07:10.255 --> 07:13.650
No offense, but being
married to Mrs. S?

07:13.694 --> 07:15.043
Barf City,

07:15.086 --> 07:17.349
population no thank you.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.546
<i>Laid-back except
for quick bursts of anger.</i>

07:20.570 --> 07:23.791
Why is this mother
Junior Jumble so hard?!

07:23.834 --> 07:25.575
-Gaah! <i>
-Lazy.</i>

07:25.619 --> 07:26.576
Oh, man.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.882
I sure am tired

07:27.925 --> 07:29.710
from that quick burst of anger.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.451
<i>Heavy substance abuse.</i>

07:34.541 --> 07:35.933
Oh, my God.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.240
I'm not <i>becoming</i> my mother.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.459
I <i>married</i> her.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.896
Now, give Momma some sugar

07:41.939 --> 07:44.768
so she can
have them sweet dreams.

07:57.651 --> 08:01.132
Mrs. S, can I sleep with
you and Mr. S tonight?

08:01.176 --> 08:03.918
Hayley realized
it's actually me who's like you,

08:03.961 --> 08:06.224
and now she's madder than Wario!

08:08.139 --> 08:12.317
It's <i>you</i> who's like me, huh?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.365
Aren't you happy?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.323
You're not going
to become your mom.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.727
Yeah, but I sure
as hell don't want

08:19.760 --> 08:21.544
to be married to her, either.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.504
Jeff needs to be
de-Francine-ified.

08:24.547 --> 08:28.856
Starting with those
beloved golden locks of his.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.988
- Say, where is Jeff?
- No idea.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.642
I've been working like a dog

08:32.686 --> 08:34.644
on my man-cave all morning.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.341
That's right.
I'm still doing that.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.780
Brother, I need to hydrate.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.873
Oh, hey there.

08:45.916 --> 08:49.616
We just got back from
the most amazing girls' day out.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.880
Look, babe!
We got mani-ped-a-files!

08:52.923 --> 08:54.988
You're just doing this
to get back at me, aren't you?

08:55.012 --> 08:57.711
Actually, Hayley,
maybe I'm just happy

08:57.754 --> 08:59.234
to finally have a "daughter"

08:59.277 --> 09:01.628
who wants to do things with me.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.368
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.066
My study group
got moved up to noon.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.415
Eunice sent me a text.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.287
On what?
A telegraph?

09:09.331 --> 09:12.160
No, Francine, on her phone.

09:12.203 --> 09:15.555
Which she did mail to me
in an envelope.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.034
I gotta get this back to her.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.955
Splooch Magooch,
there's a monkey in my cooch,

09:24.999 --> 09:27.697
and he came out
to give me a...

09:27.741 --> 09:29.307
And then, Barry, bud, you say

09:29.351 --> 09:31.614
an adjective and noun
that start with "A".

09:31.658 --> 09:32.809
Whatever pops into your head.

09:32.833 --> 09:33.940
Don't worry about
trying to be funny.

09:33.964 --> 09:34.922
Doesn't have to be funny.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.793
Angry apple.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.055
How is that funny?
I...

09:38.099 --> 09:40.014
Oh, my God,
we are so screwed.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.363
Now, if I'm up next,

09:41.406 --> 09:43.234
for example,
and I've got "B",

09:43.278 --> 09:45.497
I'm just gonna fire off
something super funny, like...

09:51.416 --> 09:53.244
How about Bronx banana?

09:53.288 --> 09:57.379
Heh. You know, like a...
like a tough New Yawk banana?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.686
Like, "'Ey,
I'm peelin' here!"

10:02.166 --> 10:03.428
"You peelin' to me?"

10:03.472 --> 10:06.518
All right.
That's more like it.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.738
There may be hope for us yet.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.222
Looks like we got
ourselves a funnyman here.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.616
<i>Okay, Steve, you think
you can push me out?</i>

10:16.659 --> 10:17.921
<i>Game on.</i>

10:17.965 --> 10:20.315
Mr. Steve's Uncle, sir?

10:23.013 --> 10:24.798
What should I do here?

10:24.841 --> 10:26.756
Well, whatever you do,
don't blow him.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.716
He just keeps coming back
again and again.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.720
Wow, Eunice.

10:33.763 --> 10:36.200
Look at all these
incredible things you've done.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.202
Professional female wrestling,

10:38.246 --> 10:40.814
fighting alongside Jane Fonda
and the Viet Cong,

10:40.857 --> 10:44.208
founding member of
the Shangri-Las and Buckcherry,

10:44.252 --> 10:46.994
hang gliding,
bang gliding.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.997
How did you make such
an amazing life for yourself?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.913
I decided early on
I wanted an exciting life.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.741
My own life.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.656
So, I left home at 12.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.266
Cut all ties.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.268
It had to be done.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.705
I didn't want to be anything
like my parents.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.838
- Are you?
- Heavens no.

11:04.881 --> 11:08.711
And neither, for that matter,
is Milford, my husband.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.191
Husband?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.672
Any of you study buddies call

11:12.715 --> 11:15.283
for an old fuddy duddy?

11:15.326 --> 11:17.415
Ha!

11:17.459 --> 11:19.983
That's us in our younger days.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.246
But you are only ever
as old as you feel.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.423
Milford here is 102
and still sharp as a tack.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.947
That's right.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.036
Well, I'm off to the lab

11:29.079 --> 11:31.865
to play tiddlywinks with Morbo.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.823
Goodbye, Constance!

11:40.090 --> 11:42.223
♪ <i>I take two steps forward</i> ♪

11:42.266 --> 11:44.486

11:48.925 --> 11:51.101
Give your momma some sugar

11:51.145 --> 11:54.104
so we can have
them sweet dreams!

11:54.148 --> 11:56.237
No!

11:56.280 --> 11:59.370
Your personality is not
going to dictate who I am!

11:59.414 --> 12:00.850
Or who I'm with!

12:00.894 --> 12:03.766
Ah don't want your life!

12:03.810 --> 12:07.117
And ah don't want your wife!

12:07.161 --> 12:09.903
I am cutting all ties with you!
Forever!

12:12.035 --> 12:14.124
All right.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.388
Next up, we got Tuttle
with "Magic Stick".

12:17.432 --> 12:19.347
Pizza Party Weekenders!

12:19.390 --> 12:21.915
Some of you have expressed,
both to me directly

12:21.958 --> 12:24.047
and to one another
in private phone calls,

12:24.091 --> 12:26.397
concerns about
my "mental state"

12:26.441 --> 12:30.271
and how hard I've been
riding our rising star here,

12:30.314 --> 12:31.794
so I just wanted you to know

12:31.838 --> 12:33.187
that Steve and I had a good talk

12:33.230 --> 12:35.929
and, well, he agrees,
and I do, too,

12:35.972 --> 12:38.148
- that he's out of the group.
- What?!

12:38.192 --> 12:40.281
Can't be trusted.
He's out. Steve's out.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.457
And Buck-Knife Joe is in.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.328
Are you sure that's a good idea?

12:44.372 --> 12:47.157
Look, Buck-Knife Joe might
have a knife around his neck,

12:47.201 --> 12:48.521
but you know
what he doesn't have?

12:48.550 --> 12:50.073
An agenda.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.815
Now, let's have some fun,
you buncha damn Judases!

12:56.906 --> 12:58.473
I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.475
I-I-I just didn't know
where else to go.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.433
That's all right, dear.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.219
You just go on and get yourself
out of those wet clothes.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.134
You can borrow some of ours.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.396
Don't worry!

13:08.439 --> 13:10.398
You're not going
to be your mother!

13:10.441 --> 13:13.357
And neither is your husband!

13:13.401 --> 13:17.535
Because you and your husband
are going to be...

13:17.579 --> 13:18.754
us.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.169
Oh, it seems like
I saw something

13:42.212 --> 13:44.867
I'm not supposed to,
but rest assured,

13:44.911 --> 13:47.739
I have absolutely no idea
what's happening.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.220
Please, do go on.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.320
Yo, U-Dog,
you sure you don't mind us

14:03.364 --> 14:05.975
wearing your fancy
old threads, kemosabe?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.891
Oh, not at all, dear.

14:08.935 --> 14:13.200
My, don't they just
fit you perfectly.

14:14.679 --> 14:18.292
Ugh! Do you have any other
tattoos I should know about?

14:18.335 --> 14:21.469
I got a Jill Stein riding
a surfboard on my upper thigh,

14:21.512 --> 14:23.601
but it's usually
covered up with pubes.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.168
Wait. Why?

14:25.212 --> 14:27.257
That's enough
damn pecan sandies!

14:27.301 --> 14:28.780
They'll go straight to my...

14:28.824 --> 14:31.609
Eh, your calves.

14:33.698 --> 14:34.656
Ba-duh!

14:34.699 --> 14:36.658
Mom?

14:36.701 --> 14:39.226
I thought you convinced the girl
to cut all ties!

14:39.269 --> 14:40.792
I did!

14:40.836 --> 14:43.317
- What do you want?
- My daughter.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.685
Well, I am not
coming back with you.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.624
Not you! Jeff.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.193
Well, he's not going anywhere.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.892
Actually, none of us are
until this storm lets up.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.024
Road's flooded.
Just barely made it up here.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.634
Yo, Milhouse, this the shitter?

14:56.678 --> 14:58.723
I had a chalupa or two
on the drive over.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.769
What the...

15:09.299 --> 15:12.694
Oh. My. God.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.217
Sweet man cave!

15:14.261 --> 15:15.827
Love the mad scientist theme.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.568
<i>Beakman's World!</i>

15:17.612 --> 15:18.961
And I bet the secret entrance

15:19.005 --> 15:21.181
keeps the wife out
on game day, amirite?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.271
Holy moly!

15:24.314 --> 15:26.273
Can you smoke a brisket
in this baby?

15:26.316 --> 15:28.884
What is this, Sears? How much
this puppy put you back?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
What you got going here?
Brewski fridge?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.757
You know,
all this place really needs is

15:32.801 --> 15:34.961
chili pepper lights everywhere,
and then right there...

15:38.807 --> 15:41.505
And then right there,
Spuds MacKenzie poster.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.246
Hold up.
I got like 10 in the car.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.554
Cool dress, Hayley.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.339
I love how it does
absolutely nothing for you.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.775
Says the woman who dresses

15:50.819 --> 15:52.342
like the pink ghost
from <i>Pac-Man.</i>

15:52.386 --> 15:53.735
Enough!

15:53.778 --> 15:55.563
I cannot stand
the inane prattling

15:55.606 --> 15:57.695
of you two trifling fools
any longer!

15:57.739 --> 15:59.654
I'm not Eunice.

15:59.697 --> 16:03.527
I'm Dr. Constance Von Stroheim!

16:03.571 --> 16:05.007
And with my husband,

16:05.051 --> 16:07.662
I've discovered the key
to eternal life.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.839
And you shall be our vessels!

16:10.882 --> 16:13.624
Morbo!

16:16.845 --> 16:18.020
What's a Morbo?

16:22.416 --> 16:25.027
Seize them, you stupid brute!

16:26.594 --> 16:28.030
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

16:33.470 --> 16:35.995
Wow.
Biggest turnout ever.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.648
I know things got
a little bumpy there

16:37.692 --> 16:39.365
for a little while,
but I think we came out

16:39.389 --> 16:41.348
the other end
all the stronger for it.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.133
Now, why don't we warm up
with a little Vroom Zoom Kaboom?

16:44.177 --> 16:45.221
Vroom.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.570
- Zoom.
- You're out.

16:46.614 --> 16:47.919
You're all out.
I'm sorry.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.965
I-I just can't work with people
I can't trust.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.141
Buck-Knife Joe has some friends.
They're in.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.597
No time to practice,
so we'll just have

16:53.621 --> 16:55.101
to do warm-up games
for the show.

16:56.624 --> 17:00.715
Splooch Magooch,
there's a monkey in my cooch,

17:00.758 --> 17:03.674
and he came out to give me a...

17:03.718 --> 17:05.894
Big surprise!

17:05.937 --> 17:09.593
The original members
of Pizza Party Weekend?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.726
Can't do characters, can we?

17:11.769 --> 17:14.555
Well, now that we have
a majority again,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
you are out!

17:20.126 --> 17:22.954
The lesson from this adventure
is clear.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.913
I'm just too trusting.

17:27.568 --> 17:31.485
So, the hubby called an audible,
and for the time being,

17:31.528 --> 17:34.966
he will be taking the body
of your vivacious mother here.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.056
- Ow!
- And we decided to use

17:37.099 --> 17:40.233
Jeff's body for the brain
of our beloved cat,

17:40.276 --> 17:42.626
Mr. Poopie.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.064
And what have you
done with Stan...

17:45.107 --> 17:46.239
you nutcase?

17:46.282 --> 17:48.067
Oh, nothing too bad.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.939
I crushed up an allergy pill
into his malt liquor.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.723
He's sleeping like
a little angel

17:52.767 --> 17:54.856
on the upstairs Davenport.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.906
Get your filthy hands
off <i>my</i> body,

18:01.950 --> 18:03.995
you putrid oaf!

18:04.039 --> 18:05.562
This will just take a sec.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.219
I shouldn't have
taken off with Jeff like that.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.414
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come here,

18:11.438 --> 18:13.004
and you'd be safe.

18:13.048 --> 18:16.834
Oh, Hayley,
I didn't really come for Jeff.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.619
I came to meet Eunice.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.142
What? Why?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.057
Because you seem to want

18:22.101 --> 18:25.016
to follow in her footsteps
so much.

18:25.060 --> 18:29.282
I really never did want you
to <i>be</i> just like me.

18:29.325 --> 18:33.155
But I did wanna be someone
you'd want to be <i>like.</i>

18:33.199 --> 18:35.766
Oh, Mom.
You are.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.768
There's a lot of things
about me...

18:37.812 --> 18:39.814
that I'm glad I got from you.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.123
Oof. Arm's cramping
from all that whipping.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.038
What a putrid oaf, right?

18:47.082 --> 18:49.519
Anywho, time to make some space

18:49.563 --> 18:53.958
in those pretty heads
for our beautiful minds.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.661
Hold hands...

19:00.704 --> 19:01.879
while we die?

19:01.923 --> 19:03.011
Can't.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.186
Strapped down.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.622
Yes, you can.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.971
You're...

19:07.015 --> 19:08.538
double-jointed.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.192
Oh, yeah.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.153
Oh, yeah!

19:22.204 --> 19:25.120
Raaahhh!

19:26.382 --> 19:28.645
Mom, wake up!
Let's go!

19:28.689 --> 19:30.734
Morbo, you beastly fool!

19:30.778 --> 19:32.083
Attack!

19:35.783 --> 19:39.090
Morbo! What the hell?
Why do you do what she says?

19:39.134 --> 19:41.354
Seriously.
Wa-peesh!

19:41.397 --> 19:43.878
Ha-ha!
Very funny.

19:43.921 --> 19:47.098
But Morbo not "whipped", okay?

19:47.142 --> 19:49.100
Morbo, you're quite
literally whipped,

19:49.144 --> 19:51.233
like all the time.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.759
What are you waiting for,
you stupid, hideous fiend?!

19:55.803 --> 19:56.934
Get them!

20:04.377 --> 20:05.552
Wha...?!

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
Mom, listen.
I'm so...

20:10.426 --> 20:12.472
Hayley, excuse me,
but I had a crazy dream

20:12.515 --> 20:14.256
just now that made me
realize something.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.041
I should be spending time
with my family,

20:17.085 --> 20:19.087
not hiding away from them
in a cave.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.499
- Dad, that's not what we...
- Hold on.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.265
Wanna get Steve on speaker
for this, too.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.397
<i>Hey, Dad, what's up?</i>

20:24.440 --> 20:26.007
I see now that a cave

20:26.050 --> 20:28.052
is a place for a bear,
not a man.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.271
The only kind of cave

20:29.315 --> 20:31.099
I want to be in from now on

20:31.142 --> 20:33.928
is a family cave.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.800
Well, your father just
cracked open another 40,

20:36.844 --> 20:38.976
so guess I'm driving.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.630
You want to follow me home?

20:40.674 --> 20:43.111
I wouldn't have it
any other way, Mom.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.213
Bye! Have a great time!
