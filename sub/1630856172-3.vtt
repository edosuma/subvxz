00:32.408 --> 00:33.534
<i>Previously on</i> Raising Kanan...

00:33.701 --> 00:35.119
Crazy that you out, man.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.370
<i>Before I went in,
we had niggas</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:37.997
<i>out on these corners
gettin' paid.</i>

00:38.164 --> 00:40.374
Raq makin' money off your back.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.252
Bitch got you out in New Jersey
makin' a nickel on $500.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.628
Cheers, Marvin.

00:44.795 --> 00:45.838
I think we both learned
a lot here.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.631
I might have
this audition comin' up.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.216
You're doin' it.
You're doin' it.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.135
I mean--and you're gonna win.
It's what you do.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.721
So you want to use
my drivers to deliver weed?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.098
I got the connect.
You got the couriers.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.100
This is my life.
She put down your boy.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.311
<i>D-Wiz? She tell you
she had me do it?</i>

01:00.478 --> 01:02.146
She just wants it
to fuck with me forever.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.732
Let me make this shit
real simple.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.859
I own you, nigga.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.861
I know you and your peoples
got y'all hands on the heron.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.279
Maybe I could tap in with you,

01:10.404 --> 01:11.697
and we could make
some moves together.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.991
We have partners
that you would need to talk to.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.659
The more I know,
the less I know.

01:15.785 --> 01:16.827
All I'm sayin' is,
something happens to me,

01:16.994 --> 01:17.828
it's not gonna be
what it looks like.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.038
I know it was you.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.998
Captain Burke.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.583
- I'm Adina Foyle.
- I don't want to know

01:22.750 --> 01:25.294
any more about you
than I already do.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.629
I need you to get rid
of our friend in Newark.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.088
I do this for you,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.757
<i>all my Italian problems,
they squashed.</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:33.636
Whoa, whoa.
No jeans, man.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.179
Whoa, whoa,
what's goin' on, man?

01:35.346 --> 01:36.847

03:40.012 --> 03:41.805
- I know you?
- Don't matter.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.015
I know you.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.839
Gonna get me some Girbauds

04:51.667 --> 04:53.877
Don't tell me,
my fucking goldfish

04:54.003 --> 04:55.713
stuck up another 7-Eleven.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.715
These cocksuckers just won't
stay out of trouble.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.924
What do you know

04:59.091 --> 05:00.384
about Sal Boselli
gettin' hit, Stefano?

05:00.551 --> 05:02.386
Only that it was
a terrible tragedy

05:02.553 --> 05:05.222
and, uh--
and an unspeakable loss

05:05.389 --> 05:07.766
for those of us
who knew and loved him.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.269
Looks like
he's got three of them.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.353
Three of what?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.730
What the fuck's
he talkin' about?

05:12.896 --> 05:16.233
We got a tip about you selling
red arowanas.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.776
They're an endangered species,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.779
and selling them is a violation
of the Lacey Act.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.533
How long did it take you
to come up

05:24.700 --> 05:26.160
with that happy horseshit?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.162
I don't even know
what a red fuckin' Pocahontas

05:28.328 --> 05:30.080
- looks like.
- Red arowana.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.041
And we're not sure
what it looks like either,

05:32.207 --> 05:34.126
which is why
we're gonna bring you in

05:34.293 --> 05:36.086
until we can get this
all sorted out.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.130
As I live and breathe
with this bullshit.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.674
The good news is,
thanks to your friend here,

05:40.841 --> 05:43.010
we've got ourselves
a gun charge, too.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.639
<i>I once heard fish grow</i>

05:47.806 --> 05:49.933
<i>to the size of their tanks.</i>

05:50.100 --> 05:52.394
<i>Fish in a small bowl
stays small.</i>

05:52.561 --> 05:55.105
<i>But you put that same fish
in a big bowl,</i>

05:55.272 --> 05:56.982
<i>he gonna bulk the fuck up.</i>

05:57.149 --> 05:59.234
<i>He gonna fill
that motherfucker.</i>

05:59.401 --> 06:02.196
<i>You give a nigga space,
he gonna take it.</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:04.281
<i>It's all about movin'
to that bigger bowl</i>

06:04.448 --> 06:07.743
<i>and spreadin' your shit out,
makin' it yours.</i>

06:07.910 --> 06:10.704
<i>And in this game,
the bowl ain't a place.</i>

06:10.871 --> 06:13.373
<i>That shit is a state of mind.</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:16.418
<i>So you gotta always be
askin' yourself,</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:20.172
<i>you a little fish
or a big fish?</i>

06:21.924 --> 06:23.592
Yo, Famous.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.718
Fame.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.472
Wake the fuck up, man.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.974
What'd I tell you about wakin'
me up before lunch?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.684
Nigga, I've reached out
to Semrad.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.686
He's expectin' us, like, now.
Let's go.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.313
I already told you, K,

06:36.480 --> 06:38.565
I ain't feelin'
that whole weed thing.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.484
I don't shit where I eat, man.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.611
I don't even know
what the hell that mean.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.988
Get the fuck up.
We 'bout to be out.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.990
Ten more minutes.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.659
Ten more minutes, nigga. Damn.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.548

07:44.673 --> 07:47.551
We gonna go up in that audition
with a fully mixed track

07:47.718 --> 07:49.511

I heard that,
got my feet movin'.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.359
Let's go from the top again.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.614
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:11.617
When somebody
want that smoke,

08:11.742 --> 08:13.202
they gonna page me.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.495
I have messengers
all over the city.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.539
And I'm gonna send
the closest one

08:17.706 --> 08:19.041

08:19.208 --> 08:21.376
That's it.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.378
I already got door-to-door.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.881
Except mine's easier.
They come to my door.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.050
I don't go nowhere,
and I make all the money.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.468
This delivery shit

08:29.593 --> 08:31.136
is a premium service,
though, Semrad.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.596
And that means

08:32.763 --> 08:33.764
premium pricing.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.515
So, even with me takin' a cut,

08:35.682 --> 08:39.186
you'll be makin' more bank
with way less risk.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.438
Ain't gonna be no motherfuckers
linin' up in your hallway

08:41.605 --> 08:42.940
or smokin' up outside,

08:43.106 --> 08:45.901
which I know seems
convenient to you, but...

08:46.068 --> 08:47.819
ain't gonna feel like that
when the neighbors

08:47.945 --> 08:50.405
start complainin'
to the police.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.701
What about your boy Famous?
Is he a part of this?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.620
'Cause I ain't fuckin'
with him--he's sloppy.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.455
<i>Famous came through
the other day,</i>

08:58.622 --> 09:01.458
smoked up and ate my entire box
of Cap'n Crunch.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.126
How many times
I gotta tell you

09:03.293 --> 09:05.337
to just play the game, Romero?

09:08.131 --> 09:10.676
He ain't wrong, though.
Famous ain't about shit.

09:10.842 --> 09:14.054
You gonna be dealin' with me
and only me.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.308
A'ight, then.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.811
Let's give this shit a whirl,
see what you got.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.312
But if I don't like
the way it works,

09:22.479 --> 09:24.314
<i>I'm not gonna hesitate
to dead the shit.</i>

09:24.481 --> 09:26.692
Semrad, if you like
gettin' paid...

09:29.236 --> 09:31.113
...you gonna love
how this shit work.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.623
<i>Unless Mr. Marchetti's
being charged with something,</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:43.792
he has nothing to say.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.670
All right? The fish in question
were saratogas, not arowanas,

09:46.837 --> 09:49.506
so the Lacey Act violation
doesn't hold water,

09:49.673 --> 09:51.174
which means the gun charge,

09:51.341 --> 09:53.677
which comes
from the same poisonous tree,

09:53.844 --> 09:55.804
is also null and void.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.016
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.685
Special Agent Andrew Higson,
Mr. Marchetti.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.228
I'm the guy that invited you

10:03.395 --> 10:06.023
<i>and all your friends
to this get-together.</i>

10:06.189 --> 10:08.025
You should be aware
that we're putting down stakes

10:08.191 --> 10:10.027
in Queens, Stefano.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.570
<i>Seems like there's
a lot goin' on</i>

10:11.737 --> 10:13.572
<i>in your neck of the woods
these days.</i>

10:14.239 --> 10:15.365
And we know everything
that happens out there

10:15.532 --> 10:16.742
comes back to you--

10:16.867 --> 10:18.660
<i>Camacho, the dope,</i>

10:18.827 --> 10:21.246
<i>all the dead Boselli guys
in the projects.</i>

10:21.413 --> 10:22.664
<i>We're gonna find out</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:25.917
what exactly went down
with Sal and who hit him

10:26.084 --> 10:27.711
because we know you know.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.548
Yeah, like you knew a fuckin'
saratoga was an arowana.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.884
Let's go, Stefano.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.510
We're done here.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.726
Agent Tanner, you know, uh,
I'm a small-business owner.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.936
I trade in exotic fish.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.397
<i>And I think the fact
that the FBI sees fit</i>

10:47.564 --> 10:49.775
to harass a modest merchant
like myself

10:49.900 --> 10:52.652
is everything that's wrong
with this country.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.321
I'll see you
around the campus, Stefano.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.574
Yeah, yeah.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.077
He trades in exotic fish, Preston.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.455
Yeah. He trades in bullshit.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.585
Federal task force
opened up shop in my precinct.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.338
They lookin' into all
the New York crime families.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.256
Bein' that you just redecorated
your old crib

11:13.423 --> 11:15.175
with a bunch of dead Italians,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.677
South Jamaica's ground zero
for the investigation.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.096
I'm out.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.764
You ain't out
till they say you out.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.599
NYPD might have bought
that shit about Crown,

11:22.766 --> 11:24.267
but the Feds is gonna dig deep.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.103
Shit, for all we know,
they already watchin' you.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.604
You got any loose ends
out there,

11:27.771 --> 11:29.272
you better tie 'em up
real tight.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.734
Your ends a whole lot
looser than mine, Detective.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.153
That dead partner of yours
all tied off yet?

11:37.239 --> 11:39.074
She killed herself.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.659
And it was
a real fuckin' tragedy.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.953
The whole department's
mourning.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.454
Show some goddamn respect.

11:47.582 --> 11:51.211
Look, other day I saw Kanan
out there with some cats.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.838
- Ain't look kosher to me.
- Who?

11:53.004 --> 11:54.631
Some fools
I ain't seen before.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.925
And we can't have Kanan
out here fuckin' up.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.802
He get in trouble,
get on the Feds' radar,

11:58.969 --> 12:00.011
they get to sniffin' around,

12:00.178 --> 12:02.013
and bring down
the whole house of cards.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.057
Kanan ain't no fool.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.600
We straight.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.771
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.815
I'm sure you gonna get
past it soon, though.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.995
<i>Kanan! You in there?</i>

12:25.162 --> 12:26.830
Oh, shit. Oh, sh...

12:26.997 --> 12:28.123
<i>I can hear somebody
in there--open up.</i>

12:28.290 --> 12:29.583
Damn it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.043
Good morning.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.714
Where Kanan?

12:35.881 --> 12:37.507
Um, bounced
while I was still asleep.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.217
Right, you know who he with?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.344
Uh, dude from school, I think.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.555
Who he been kickin' with,
Famous?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.265
'Cause I'm hearin'
he got some new friends

12:45.432 --> 12:46.850
and that they the wrong kind
of friends.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.979
Kanan got new friends?
I--shit, I didn't know that.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.522
Hey, I-I should get
new friends.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.858
All I got's the old,
tired ones.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.234
What's all this?

12:57.527 --> 13:00.113
Um, people leave their shit
here all the time, you know?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.656
Really, um...

13:06.328 --> 13:07.579
Well, um...

13:07.746 --> 13:11.041
I came by
to give you both this.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.542
Word?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.878
That's mad nice of you.

13:15.045 --> 13:19.216
If you and Kanan need anything,
you come to me, got it?

13:19.382 --> 13:20.592
I got it.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.312
What the fuck?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.161
<i>When the police on you,</i>

13:48.328 --> 13:50.080
<i>you stare straight ahead.</i>

13:50.247 --> 13:52.290
<i>When the Feds fuckin'
with you, though,</i>

13:52.415 --> 13:54.209
<i>you lookin'
over your shoulder.</i>

14:19.067 --> 14:20.944
You late.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.697
Had to handle some shit
for Jerome, man.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.031
Still late.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.870
Why aren't we up and runnin'
and makin' this money yet?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.706
Tryin' to get this workout in,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.624
first thing this nigga
wanna talk is business.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.085
Like I said before, Ronnie,

14:37.252 --> 14:40.213
still gettin'
some shit together right now.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.425
Gonna take a little minute.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.097
While you take your minute,
Raq eatin' our fuckin' lunch.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.059
<i>Listen, man...</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:55.979
you ain't gotta worry
about Raq no more.

14:56.146 --> 14:59.107
She done, out the way.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.210
If Raq breathin',
she hustlin'.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.254
Should've took her out
back in the day.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.258
Never too late for that, though.

15:37.979 --> 15:41.232
♪ Oh, I've always
Known you'd go ♪

15:43.026 --> 15:47.072
♪ And do what you gotta do ♪

15:57.040 --> 15:58.375
Hey.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.502
Could hear you singin'
from outside.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.545
Them other girls
should just stay the hell home

16:02.712 --> 16:04.506
'cause they don't stand
a chance.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.049
My dad told you
about the audition?

16:06.174 --> 16:07.634
Mm-hmm.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.220
Now, you know I can't let you
get up on that stage

16:10.387 --> 16:13.139
without something special
from me.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.564
Aunt Raq, it's beautiful.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.109
Let me see it on you.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.947
Mm.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.619
It's gonna go perfect
with them earrings you got on.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.371
I love it.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.415
Gonna look like the superstar
that you are.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.417
- Thank you.
- Of course.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.419
Now, you gonna let me know
how it goes?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.421
Don't let me have to hear it
from your father,

16:44.587 --> 16:45.839
'cause you know I can't get

16:46.005 --> 16:48.800
no straight story outta him.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.094
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.388
Mm.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.807
Ah, by the way,

16:55.974 --> 16:57.517
you know anything
about what Kanan gettin' into

16:57.684 --> 16:59.394
over at Famous'?

16:59.561 --> 17:02.772
Uh, I ain't seen Kanan
in a minute.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.483
Been so focused on gettin'
ready for my audition.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.110
Of course.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.696
But if he is gettin'
into some shit,

17:09.863 --> 17:12.031
<i>you know I need to know
about it, Juke.</i>

17:12.198 --> 17:13.450
No doubt.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.287
They gonna hear you tomorrow,

17:17.454 --> 17:20.415
and they gonna forget
about everybody else.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.126
Promise you that.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.894
We doin' this shit.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.646
<i>Round up Paul's crew,</i>

17:43.813 --> 17:45.523
get this motherfuckin' show
on the road.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.525
This seems stupid to me.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.986
All these police everywhere
right now.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.154
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:51.321 --> 17:53.490
What the fuck is up with you?

17:53.656 --> 17:55.450
I figure out a way
to get us paid,

17:55.617 --> 17:56.868
and all you do is shit on it.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.328
<i>Meanwhile, you sit
around all day,</i>

17:58.453 --> 18:01.581
get high, and eat Semrad kid
Cap'n Crunch.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.750
Romero's snitch-ass told you--

18:03.917 --> 18:05.043
That little motherfucker

18:05.210 --> 18:06.377
wouldn't last a minute
on these streets.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.630
And neither are you
with your broke ass.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.591
Famous, if you ain't got money,
you ain't got shit, man.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.187
Your moms brought this through.

18:24.354 --> 18:27.857
Said we need anything,
she got us.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.026
We don't got to hustle no more.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.028
Raq lookin' out, K.

18:32.195 --> 18:35.031
Uh, you let my mother
in the crib...

18:35.198 --> 18:37.408
and took money from her?

18:37.575 --> 18:38.701
I--No, uh--

18:38.868 --> 18:41.329
I don't take nothin'
from her no more,

18:41.496 --> 18:44.707
especially not her fuckin'
money.

18:44.874 --> 18:48.211
You let Raq in this crib again,
I'm fuckin' you up, nigga.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.629
You hear me?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.842
We fuckin' with Semrad on this,

18:54.008 --> 18:56.886
and we not talkin'
about it again.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.046
Oh, yeah!

20:00.366 --> 20:03.119
The Italians didn't tell me
you were young.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.038
Same for you, man.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.957
But unlike you,
I have my crew behind me.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.754
Someone painted the walls
with your people out in Newark.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.672
<i>You're alone.</i>

20:14.839 --> 20:17.008
Well, as you can see,
I'm still here.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.968
<i>And I ain't goin' nowhere.</i>

20:19.135 --> 20:20.637
<i>You see,
when shit get real for me,</i>

20:20.803 --> 20:23.014
I don't run.

20:23.181 --> 20:26.976
I don't get on no raft
or no inner tube,

20:27.143 --> 20:29.520
whatever the fuck it is
you floated here on.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.692
I stay in my fuckin' war.
I stand, and I fight.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.707
Here's how it works.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.003
<i>My people in southeast Asia
put the heroin on boats.</i>

20:54.170 --> 20:55.880
<i>It gets unloaded in Canada.</i>

20:56.047 --> 20:58.508
Then the Italians
truck it down to New York.

20:58.675 --> 21:02.053
From there, it gets disbursed
through local distributors.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.763
<i>Up until now,
we've kept it close--</i>

21:03.930 --> 21:05.765
only work with people we know.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.103
But the fishmonger
vouched for you,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.105
<i>and that counts for something.</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:13.523
<i>We'll start you
with a small package,</i>

21:13.690 --> 21:14.899
<i>see how you do.</i>

21:15.066 --> 21:16.776
You'll use
my cousin's Chinese restaurant

21:16.943 --> 21:18.361
for distribution.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.197
It's in your neighborhood.

21:21.364 --> 21:25.368
While I appreciate the look...

21:25.535 --> 21:27.537
I'll find my own spot.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.122
You either sell
out of my cousin's restaurant,

21:29.288 --> 21:30.707
or you don't sell at all.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.042
Why the fuck you need me
if you could go to your cousin?

21:33.209 --> 21:36.212
My cousin's Chinese...

21:36.379 --> 21:38.548
and I don't fuck
with the Chinese.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.884
What you mean you don't fuck
with the Chinese, man?

21:42.051 --> 21:44.595
All you people is from the same
cradle of civilization.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.055
<i>I don't understand.</i>

21:46.222 --> 21:47.932
Chinese think they're better
than the rest of us,

21:48.099 --> 21:49.434
act like they own
the fucking place

21:49.559 --> 21:51.060
and everyone else
is just renting.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.730
Motherfuck the Chinese.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.732
So how you got
a Chinese cousin, then?

21:55.898 --> 21:57.567
'Cause I have a Chinese wife.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.195
Can't help who we love.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.366
Ain't that the damn truth.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.247
So this restaurant guy
is your wife's cousin.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.958
She's been on my ass
to help him.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.586
It's one thing to be married
to a Chinese,

22:16.753 --> 22:18.963
<i>another thing altogether
to be in business with one.</i>

22:19.088 --> 22:20.631
So...

22:20.757 --> 22:22.467
are we good?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.594
Fuck it.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.764
I've been feelin' that
sweet and sour lately anyway.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.432
Most of their food's shit.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.351
Wouldn't feed it
to my fuckin' dog.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.687
They got a couple soups
I like, though.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.785
<i>You get my shit?</i>

22:50.745 --> 22:52.121
Where is 'Nique?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.959
Weren't you just at the gym
with him?

22:57.126 --> 23:00.797
I was at the gym with him,
but I'm not with him now.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.382
So I don't know
where the fuck he is.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.721
<i>Maybe he got himself
a side piece.</i>

23:10.473 --> 23:12.642
Maybe that's where he at.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.477
Fuck you, Ronnie.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.146
What can I do
for you, Detective?

24:00.815 --> 24:02.191
We overrun, Cap.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.360
Who you tellin'?

24:04.527 --> 24:07.655
This morning
was a goddamn circus.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.240
<i>All these reporters
tryin' to bust in</i>

24:09.407 --> 24:10.867
<i>because they thought
these Mob guys</i>

24:11.033 --> 24:12.827
that got rounded up
got brought here.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.871
The Feds keepin' you
in the loop on all that?

24:15.037 --> 24:16.455
What do you think?

24:16.581 --> 24:19.208
I'm a piece of furniture
to them--

24:19.375 --> 24:21.043
somethin' they move around
to get where they're goin',

24:21.210 --> 24:23.421
<i>unless they need something,
that is,</i>

24:23.588 --> 24:26.591
in which case they sit down
a get way too comfortable.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.927
Meanwhile, between Sacristano's
never-ending pile of shit

24:30.052 --> 24:33.264
<i>and Burke's fuckin' skeletons,
I'm buried over here.</i>

24:33.431 --> 24:34.640
Whoa, whoa.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.726
I thought IAD was easin'
off of Burke.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.561
They're tryin'.

24:38.728 --> 24:41.564
Last thing the department needs
is more bad PR.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.400
But Detective Foyle won't stop
pressin' the issue.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.903
<i>- She's makin' a lot of noise.</i>
- Foyle?

24:47.028 --> 24:48.738
<i>Burke's special friend</i>

24:48.863 --> 24:50.531

to your dad.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.218
Nothin' happened to him.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.428
Did it to himself.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.138
Gave up on livin'

30:48.264 --> 30:49.598
just like he did
music and boxing

30:49.765 --> 30:51.475
and everything else
he fuckin' tried.

31:09.577 --> 31:11.954
Crib still look empty, baby.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.456

31:14.623 --> 31:17.293

31:17.459 --> 31:19.461
You know,
it's been a lot goin' on.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.297
Gotta figure out

31:21.463 --> 31:23.591
how to wash all this money
I got left over.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.385
Shit just collectin' dust
in a storage unit.

31:29.013 --> 31:31.890
You could definitely spread
some of that around in here.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.311
Not enough.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.980
Gotta make a bigger move
with that money.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.526
While you make
a bigger move on that,

31:42.651 --> 31:44.570
I'm gonna make a bigger move
on you.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.786
Do what you gonna do,
then, boy.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.143

32:16.268 --> 32:18.854

32:36.330 --> 32:38.123

32:39.875 --> 32:41.251
Whoa, whoa.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.045
You got our money or not?

32:43.212 --> 32:45.089
Only reason this motherfucker's
still breathing

32:45.255 --> 32:47.883
is 'cause he said
you were good for it.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.094
- How much?
- Five.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.887
He told me three on the phone.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.847
You gonna believe him?

32:55.557 --> 32:57.267
He doesn't even know
what his own fuckin' name is.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.195
Pleasure doing business
with you.

33:08.362 --> 33:09.905

37:27.162 --> 37:29.331
Been a while, Adina.

37:29.498 --> 37:31.833
Malcolm.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.418
Just wanted to check on you.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.505
We didn't speak
at the memorial, and...

37:36.672 --> 37:38.131
I know
from when we worked together,

37:38.298 --> 37:41.009
you and Shannon were tight.

37:41.176 --> 37:45.180
Look, whatever she said
or thought about me,

37:45.347 --> 37:47.099
I cared about her.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.684
She thought
I was into some shit,

37:48.850 --> 37:49.851
and I ain't gonna lie--

37:50.018 --> 37:51.853
some of what she was talkin'
was real.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.648
Wasn't her business.
Ain't yours either.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.067
But she was my partner,
for Christ's sake.

37:57.234 --> 38:00.153
I always had her back.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.656
And I'm angry at how
the department treated her.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.950
They fucked her over.
They didn't have her back.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.660
This whole IAD shit--

38:06.785 --> 38:09.746
it's been a witch hunt
since day one.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.708
Shannon told me
if anything happened to her,

38:12.833 --> 38:14.918
it wouldn't be
what it looked like.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.170
Wouldn't be
what it looked like?

38:19.589 --> 38:22.009
It looked
like she was really unhappy.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.636
And the rest of us,
the people who cared about her,

38:24.803 --> 38:27.180
we missed
all the warning signs.

38:29.558 --> 38:33.729
But what you sayin'?
You think it wasn't a suicide?

38:33.895 --> 38:36.231
I don't know what to think.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.401
Adina, you know as well as I do

38:39.568 --> 38:42.404
that Shannon never believed she
was even cut out for the job

38:42.571 --> 38:44.740
for all sorts of reasons,
and that shit--

38:44.906 --> 38:47.993
that shit got to her head,
got to her heart.

38:49.578 --> 38:50.912
And I should've stepped in.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.748
I should've gotten her help.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.416
I'ma blame myself
for not doing that

38:54.583 --> 38:56.293
for the rest of my life.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.797
Shannon wasn't in a good place.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.260
She wasn't.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.511
And that's why I don't want

39:06.678 --> 39:08.847
anyone's final memories
of Shannon Burke

39:09.014 --> 39:11.975
to be a fucking
IAD investigation.

39:12.142 --> 39:16.104
They gotta shut that shit down
so she can rest in peace.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.273
It's the least
we can do for her.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.738
Like I said, I just wanted
to check on you.

39:24.905 --> 39:27.908

I'm here.

Where you stay at?

42:04.940 --> 42:07.108
A'ight.

42:11.238 --> 42:13.448
Goddamn,
this just all happened now?

42:13.615 --> 42:16.576
I can barely keep up
with this shit.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.789
We gonna need
more delivery boys.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.627
We changin'
the fuckin' game, nigga.

42:37.973 --> 42:41.142
<i>Yo, Lou,
that shit was bananas.</i>

42:41.309 --> 42:42.852
<i>Not too bad.</i>

42:43.019 --> 42:45.605
<i>Not too bad at all.</i>

42:45.772 --> 42:47.274
<i>That's how I do.</i>

42:59.077 --> 43:01.830
Get your ass in there.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.632
Fuck.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.070
- What's up?
- Order?

43:34.195 --> 43:36.698
Actually lookin'
for Richard and Sunny.

43:36.865 --> 43:38.366
They here?

43:38.491 --> 43:40.493
Mom, Dad.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.547
You know, I got a kid, too--

43:52.714 --> 43:54.507
small boy.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.551
<i>Yours makin' mine
look real lazy, though.</i>

43:56.718 --> 43:59.554
Maybe it's time
I put him to work.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.568
What the fuck is y'all talkin'
'bout back there?

44:13.735 --> 44:15.403
Is there some kind of problem?

44:16.696 --> 44:18.531
Let me come out from here.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.540
No problem. No problem, hmm?

44:27.707 --> 44:29.709
A'ight.

44:29.876 --> 44:33.421
So let's talk about addin'
some shit to the menu, then.

44:47.769 --> 44:49.104
I'll be right back.

44:49.270 --> 44:50.688
I got you.

44:50.855 --> 44:51.940
Excuse me.

45:36.818 --> 45:39.446
Everything already signed,
sealed, and delivered, bitches.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.156
I'm just tryin' to see
which one of you hos

45:41.322 --> 45:42.699
is gonna be my backups.

45:42.866 --> 45:44.993
But lucky for y'all...

45:45.160 --> 45:46.619
there's two more spots.

46:19.486 --> 46:20.695
Want one?

46:22.113 --> 46:24.032
Yeah.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.457
Break a leg, Polo girl.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.460
Thanks.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.723
<i>Juke!</i>

46:50.183 --> 46:51.559
Uncle Lou not here?

46:51.726 --> 46:54.145
Look, fuck Lou.
This about you and you alone.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.730
Yeah, but he has
the track I'm singin' to.

46:55.897 --> 46:57.440
You don't need no track
when you got that voice.

46:57.565 --> 46:59.901
- Jukebox Thomas?
- Right here.

47:00.068 --> 47:02.278
Jukebox? That's your name?

47:02.445 --> 47:04.656
Yeah.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.407
Look, remember
the work you put in--

47:06.533 --> 47:07.825
you've been puttin' in.

47:07.992 --> 47:11.162
It's all you, baby.
Always been all you.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.499
Louis Thomas?

47:20.463 --> 47:22.549
You dried out?

47:29.055 --> 47:30.473
Fuck.

47:33.226 --> 47:34.602
<i>Jukebox Thomas?</i>

47:41.859 --> 47:43.403
Kiss my ass, Lou.

47:52.245 --> 47:55.707
Do you have
any accompaniment, Miss Thomas?

47:55.873 --> 47:57.959
No.

You joinin' us today?

49:38.726 --> 49:41.813

Next time, then.

49:44.232 --> 49:46.526
- Salaam, Brother Malcolm.
- Salaam.

50:03.751 --> 50:05.503
We're not open yet.

50:07.547 --> 50:11.008
Well, if it isn't
Sugar Ray Robinson himself.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.928
Bell's rung, Ray. Fight's over.

50:14.095 --> 50:16.097
Owe you an apology.

50:17.306 --> 50:20.601
<i>Felt like that fool
was disrespecting your spot.</i>

50:20.768 --> 50:23.062
<i>Guess I ended up
doin' that myself.</i>

50:24.647 --> 50:27.150
I fucked up.

50:27.316 --> 50:29.110
I just came by
to say I'm sorry.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.614
You know what, Sugar Ray?

50:33.781 --> 50:35.116
It wasn't the worst thing

50:35.283 --> 50:37.952
havin' somebody put
that asshole in his place.

50:38.119 --> 50:39.746
<i>I deal with guys like that
every night.</i>

50:39.912 --> 50:42.290
But they walk all over me.

50:42.457 --> 50:45.126
Not last night, though.

50:45.293 --> 50:46.961
<i>You made sure of that.</i>

50:47.128 --> 50:48.713
<i>By the way,</i>

50:48.880 --> 50:52.383
I saw how your eyes were glued
to those performers.

50:52.508 --> 50:56.220
You got that music bug,
just like your dad.

50:56.345 --> 50:59.599
Those MCs that were up there...

50:59.724 --> 51:01.058
what's their story?

51:01.225 --> 51:02.894
Uh, I couldn't tell you.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.896
Uh, rap isn't exactly my genre.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.482
You know somethin'.
They were pretty good.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.358
And they came here to spit.

51:09.525 --> 51:10.610
They're not the only ones.

51:10.777 --> 51:12.403
For some reason,
I'm the destination

51:12.570 --> 51:14.030
for a lot of these kids.

51:14.155 --> 51:16.240
'Cause you let 'em do they
thing--they appreciate that.

51:18.910 --> 51:22.330
Hey, if you need any help,
like, with...

51:22.497 --> 51:25.792
dealin' with punk-ass audiences
or findin' performers

51:25.958 --> 51:27.919
<i>or fuckin' with promotion,
I'm your guy.</i>

51:28.085 --> 51:31.005
Well, truth be told,
I could use help all over.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.716
I-I've been runnin' this place
myself for the last 15 years,

51:33.841 --> 51:36.844
but, really, it's--it's
been runnin' me.

51:37.011 --> 51:38.596
I mean, you already got
heads comin' through

51:38.763 --> 51:41.098
with no marketing at all.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.351
Imagine if we made
that stage right there

51:43.518 --> 51:46.521
into a proving ground for
a new generation of artists.

51:46.687 --> 51:51.067
They can come, make they bones,
stake they claim.

51:51.234 --> 51:53.110
Well, my door's open to you,
Sugar Ray.

51:53.277 --> 51:56.155
Hey, if you've got some ideas

51:56.322 --> 51:59.617
on how to reinvent
this old dive,

51:59.784 --> 52:02.203
I am all ears.

52:02.370 --> 52:04.205
But no more fisticuffs.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.541
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.251
<i>Like we discussed
over the phone,</i>

52:08.417 --> 52:12.129
my client is motivated to sell
but only at the right price.

52:12.296 --> 52:14.549
As you can see,
it's a great property

52:14.715 --> 52:16.008
in a great location.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.849
Any offer I make
is gonna be straight cash,

52:23.015 --> 52:24.392
and it ain't gonna be negotiable.

52:24.559 --> 52:27.728
One number--we either got
a deal, or we don't.

52:37.947 --> 52:40.950
She doesn't look like
a criminal mastermind to me.

52:42.702 --> 52:45.413
But I wouldn't mind fuckin' her
just to make sure.

52:59.010 --> 53:00.344
<i>Thing about these fish</i>

53:00.511 --> 53:04.223
<i>is that they
always gotta be movin'.</i>

53:04.348 --> 53:06.434
<i>Can't stop for nobody
or nothin'.</i>

53:08.477 --> 53:10.479
<i>They not movin',
they sink to the bottom</i>

53:10.646 --> 53:13.441
<i>or even worse, they a mark.</i>

53:15.067 --> 53:18.279
Yo, s-someone's clockin' us.

53:24.577 --> 53:25.995
That's Unique brother.

53:27.663 --> 53:30.291
Let his ass out
'cause of that dirty cop.

53:32.168 --> 53:35.004
What the fuck he want with us?

53:35.171 --> 53:37.298
<i>He givin' them ill vibes.</i>

53:37.465 --> 53:39.467
Let's get the fuck outta here.

53:39.634 --> 53:41.302
