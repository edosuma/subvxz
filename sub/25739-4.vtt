23:56.269 --> 23:58.270
God, every dude horse
is a lying piece of shit.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.638
I'm going back to chicks after this.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.807
Listen, Julia. I promise you,

24:01.809 --> 24:05.666
I had no idea how extreme
my sister's intentions were.

24:06.143 --> 24:08.346
(KISSES) What do you say
we start a revolution?

24:08.348 --> 24:10.281
(BOTH YELL)

24:11.517 --> 24:13.584
PHIL: And as you can see
here, we've got depicted

24:13.586 --> 24:15.854
the great Budmeisner Class Wars.

24:15.856 --> 24:17.989
As we all know,
that was a big turning point

24:17.991 --> 24:20.458
in transforming Ye Olde
Horseburg into the new

24:20.460 --> 24:25.096
egalitarian, equestrian New Horseburg
that we know and love today.

24:25.098 --> 24:26.865
FOAL: How long ago was all this?

24:26.867 --> 24:29.000
Uh... from today? Like two months ago.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.334
Is that Stanley Tucci?

24:30.336 --> 24:31.702
Yes, Billy.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.504
Does anyone else have questions?

24:33.506 --> 24:35.874
All right, Budmeisner.
Have a good night, man.

24:35.876 --> 24:37.875
(NEW YORK ACCENT) That's right.
It's me, Mr. Budmeisner.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.878
So much time has gone by,
I lost my accent.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.446
I'm sweeping floors now. I'm having fun.

24:43.448 --> 24:45.715
That's my storyline. See ya!

24:45.717 --> 24:47.284
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

24:49.188 --> 24:50.788
MIKE: Hip, hip, hip.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.355
Put your pounds in me hat,

24:52.357 --> 24:54.758
- and I'll read you a poem.
- PHIL: Is that...?

24:56.061 --> 24:59.296
Hey, you... you were the guy that
was about to marry Julia, right?

24:59.298 --> 25:02.399
The little dude, and we kept
getting in fights with each other.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.002
You were the carriage horse
who stole my woman from me.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.403
- PHIL: Yeah.
- MIKE: How is she?

25:06.405 --> 25:08.538
- Who's that?
- Julia.

25:09.362 --> 25:10.540
Julia... Roberts?

25:10.542 --> 25:12.742
Julia. The girl...
the girl that we were both...

25:12.744 --> 25:14.071
from before that I was engaged to,

25:14.096 --> 25:15.912
- and you were ruining things?
- Oh, Julia Budmeisner!

25:15.914 --> 25:18.214
Exactly. (CLEARS THROAT)
Julia Budmeisner.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.482
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:19.484 --> 25:23.353
We broke up, like, a few days
after the big Budmeisner war.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.423
Wow. Okay. No, that's... okay.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.058
- PHIL: Mm-hmm.
- MIKE: I just... I hope she's doing well.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.894
You know what? She's dating the
bassist for Mac DeMarco now.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.062
Is that impressive? I don't...

25:33.064 --> 25:35.598
I feel like Mac DeMarco's
kind of a small indie thing.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.734
PHIL: No, They actually, like,
sell out pretty big venues.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.268
