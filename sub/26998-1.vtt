01:48.733 --> 01:52.904
In the town of Greendale,
where it always feels like Halloween,

01:52.987 --> 01:58.493
there lived a girl who is half-witch,
half-mortal, who, on her 16th birthday,

02:01.246 --> 02:04.999
the witch world of her family,
and the human world of her friends.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.087
My name is Sabrina Spellman,
and that girl is me.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.349
I was confused by the zombies.
I mean, why were they so freakin' slow?

02:21.432 --> 02:24.352
Fast-moving zombies
is a relatively new concept in horror.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.855
Earlier incarnations assumed
that reanimated corpses

02:26.938 --> 02:31.151
were afflicted by rigor mortis,
and, as such, moved slowly.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.863
-How does she know these things?
-No idea.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.116
-Just thought they were kinda weird.
-I thought it was weird too.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.075
It's fine.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.785
Oh, excuse me.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.705
-Sabrina.
-Ms. Wardwell. Hi.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.624
I didn't know you were a fan
of horror movies.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.210
Sabrina's nuts for 'em,
the gorier the better.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.673
Well, um, who doesn't enjoy a good scare
every now and again?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.425
Especially this time of year.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.304
Ms. Wardwell, we have a tradition
of going to the movies

02:59.387 --> 03:03.308
and then to Dr. Cerberus's
to dissect whatever we just saw.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.061
-Do you want to join us?
-I have papers to grade.

03:07.812 --> 03:11.191
But thank you, thank you for the offer.
Really.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.903
See you in class, guys.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.701
'Brina, why would you do that?

03:22.493 --> 03:23.953
-Invite Ms. Wardwell?
-Yeah.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.999
I feel bad for her,
living in that house...

03:29.959 --> 03:30.793
all alone.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.068
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.491
Oh, my God.

04:12.001 --> 04:12.919
Hello?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.221
Help me, please.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.351
Oh, my God.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.608
You poor creature.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.404
My cottage is just down the road.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.075
We'll get you all cleaned up,
then call Dr. Saperstein in the morning.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.502
The whole thing
functions as a metaphor.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.129
It's a monster movie, Susie.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.214
Devil's advocate,
can't it be both?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.383
-Exactly! Exactly, it is both.
-Yes.

05:00.466 --> 05:04.012
On one level, yes, it's about zombies,
but it's also about the Cold War.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.597
-Civil rights.
-The collapse of the nuclear family.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.183
Did we just watch different movies

05:09.267 --> 05:13.479
From when the daughter turned
into a zombie and then ate her mother?

05:13.563 --> 05:17.108
I think Harvey may have had his
eyes closed during that part.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.818
-No, I didn't.
-Aww!

05:18.901 --> 05:21.696
Oh, that's terrible.
You missed the best...

05:22.363 --> 05:25.241
-Save yourself, Sabrina!
-No!

05:25.325 --> 05:26.451
I'm a little scared.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.203
-You seem very scared.
-They're in the woods. Mmm!

05:31.497 --> 05:33.499
No, I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.085
"They're coming to get you, Barbara."

05:36.169 --> 05:41.174
Harvey Kinkle, the only person
you're gonna scare is yourself!

05:43.551 --> 05:44.427
Gotcha.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.771
I got you something.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.153
Harvey.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.292
I love you, Sabrina.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.463
I was gonna wait
until your birthday to say that...

06:21.381 --> 06:24.258
but since we maybe can't celebrate
together this year, I thought--

06:24.342 --> 06:25.718
I'm glad you didn't.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.679
I love it.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.515
And you.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.901
Good night, Harvey.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.653
Good night, Sabrina.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.447
I brewed you some tea.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.244
I found some yummy almond cookies
in the cupboard.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.457
Won't you tell me your name

07:40.293 --> 07:41.502
Did someone attack you?

07:43.754 --> 07:44.714
No.

07:51.137 --> 07:51.971
The woods did.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.893
Oh, well...

07:59.020 --> 08:00.771
You're not from around here, are you?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.649
Everyone knows about
the witch hunt in Salem,

08:04.233 --> 08:06.736
but there was one right here
in Greendale...

08:07.653 --> 08:09.071
1692.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.992
Thirteen witches were hung
in the forest...

08:14.410 --> 08:17.622
and their angry spirits
have haunted the woods ever since.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.332
How do you know so much...

08:19.957 --> 08:20.917
about witches?

08:22.793 --> 08:27.965
Well, I am Greendale's
unofficial town historian, I suppose.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.803
Plus, I teach at the local high school,
Baxter High.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.934
Is one of your students named... Sabrina?

08:40.436 --> 08:41.521
Why, yes.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.357
Sabrina Spellman.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.694
Do you know Sabrina?

08:48.986 --> 08:51.906
No, but I knew her bastard-of-a-father

08:51.989 --> 08:55.535
who broke sacred witch law
when he married a mortal sow.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.248
The great work begins, Dark Lord.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.043
I shall deliver Sabrina unto you.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.403
Absit omen.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.295
Good morning, Aunties. Ambrose.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.090
Morning, darling. How did you sleep?

11:14.173 --> 11:16.050
Tempestuously, by the sounds of it.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.345
Now that you mention it, Aunt Zee,
I did wake up once or twice.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.264
It's an exciting time...

11:22.348 --> 11:23.516
...in more ways than one.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.477
Hmm, I remember the week before
my dark baptism.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.647
It felt as if my real life
were finally beginning.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.065
I barely slept.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.611
Rabbit's feet, under your pillow tonight,
you'll sleep like the dead.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.949
Speaking of the dead,
a bat flew into my room last night.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.535
-Smashed through one of my windows.
-Oh, want me to bring it back?

11:42.618 --> 11:44.954
No, Ambrose,
we'll have none of your necromancy.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.331
-Okay if I bury it in the garden?
-Yes. As you wish.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.918
You can bury it in the pet cemetery
by the sundial. There's room there.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.795
Oh, wait, what's this?

11:52.878 --> 11:56.549
Before it can be baptized, the temple
of your body needs to be purified.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.883
Cleansed of its toxins.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.637
This is actually milk and eggs
and rosemary and agrimony,

12:01.721 --> 12:05.224
and a cupful of vanilla and a pinch
of John the Conqueror root and...

12:05.725 --> 12:06.684
tannis.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.811
Uh, and other herbs from my garden.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.271
Drink up, darling.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.982
-Don't do it, cousin.
-Ambrose.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.611
Sabrina, you need to pick a familiar
before your dark baptism.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.238
The Council sent the registry.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.158
I've, uh, indicated
a few suitable options.

12:22.867 --> 12:27.955
Now, there's a very handsome hedgehog,
a noble-looking owl.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.916
Vinegar Tom would happily welcome
another dog.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.710
About that, Aunt Zee.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.672
Instead of picking a familiar
out of a book,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.842
which is so, I don't know, dehumanizing--

12:39.925 --> 12:43.262
Familiars are goblins who have taken on
the shape of animals

12:43.345 --> 12:46.015
to better serve their witch masters.
There's nothing human about them.

12:46.098 --> 12:51.020
But I've been practicing a summoning spell
I found in the Demonomicon, and...

12:51.604 --> 12:54.774
what if I put it out there
that I'm looking for a familiar,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.485
and see if anyone wants to volunteer?

12:57.568 --> 13:00.070
I think that's a charming idea.

13:00.696 --> 13:04.033
What about your baptismal name

13:04.116 --> 13:05.951
I have, as a matter of fact.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.788
Edwina Diana.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.541
Edwina, which is almost Edward,
to honor my father,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.585
and Diana, to honor my mother.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.338
And not just to honor them...

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
to be closer to them.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.177
To have them with me
as I walk the Path of Night.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.930
I wasn't gonna cry.
And...

13:26.055 --> 13:29.809
I just wish your mom and dad were here
to see this, to see you.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.561
-Me too, Auntie.
-They would be so proud of you.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.939
They would be so proud of
the young woman you've become.

13:35.022 --> 13:39.819
Correction, Hilda, they'd be so proud of
the young witch she is becoming.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.631
Penny Dreadful for your thoughts, cousin?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.175
Just...

14:03.968 --> 14:07.721
...some people might say that a bat
crashing through a window is a bad omen.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.767
I also found a two-headed frog
in my shoe yesterday.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.562
Hold a tick,
you're not having doubts, are you,

14:14.645 --> 14:16.021
about your dark baptism?

14:17.231 --> 14:20.526
Back inside with Madams Jekyll and Hyde,
you seemed excited.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.988
And I am. But I'm also a little--

14:24.071 --> 14:28.033
It's all right to--
to be a little nervous.

14:28.534 --> 14:32.663
Going into the woods,
signing your name in the Dark Lord's book.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.456
Even I had butterflies.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.128
What have you told your mortal friends?

14:39.211 --> 14:42.256
That you're being transferred to some
posh boarding school in Connecticut?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.260
Cousin...

14:47.469 --> 14:50.222
-you have told them something, I hope.
-Not yet.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.810
-I'm waiting for the right time.
-But it will never be the right time.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.062
That's why you must rip
this particular Band-Aid off.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.649
You wouldn't understand, Ambrose,
you were born a full witch.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.402
You didn't have to say goodbye
to half your life,

15:03.485 --> 15:05.070
your friends, your boyfriend.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.157
True, but afterwards,
when you're fully a witch,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.867
you'll stay younger longer.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.369
You'll cultivate your gifts
at the Academy of Unseen Arts,

15:12.453 --> 15:14.246
where your father was headmaster.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.166
You will belong, cousin,
in every sense of the word.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.375
I know.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.630
And I want all those things. I do.
It's just...

15:26.717 --> 15:27.676
It's dumb.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.305
You're only supposed
to start missing things

15:31.388 --> 15:33.140
after you say goodbye to them, right?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.392
I've been under house arrest
with our aunties

15:35.476 --> 15:37.436
for the last 75 years, Sabrina.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.605
Forbidden from leaving these grounds.

15:40.272 --> 15:44.276
I am continuously missing everything.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.008
Spirits of the forest,
I pronounce my intentions to thee.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.845
Come forth and seek me,
and equal we will be.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.934
Not master and servant,
but familiar to familiar,

16:17.559 --> 16:21.605
to share our knowledge,
our spirit, and our traits.

16:31.323 --> 16:35.536
And now, spirits, we will wait.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.136
A summoning spell, Sabrina?

16:53.679 --> 16:57.016
-Calling forth a familiar?
-Then you are being baptized.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.726
Prudence, Dorcas, Agatha.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.394
Well, well, well...

17:01.145 --> 17:03.355
And are we to assume
that means you'll be transferring

17:03.439 --> 17:05.482
to the Academy of Unseen Arts as well?

17:05.733 --> 17:06.859
That's the plan.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.610
That's unfortunate.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.196
We don't want half-breeds at the academy.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.574
And who, exactly,
are you calling a half-breed?

17:13.949 --> 17:18.037
Isn't that what you are

17:19.038 --> 17:20.873
Stay with your own kind.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.752
You don't want what happened to
your mother and father to happen to you.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.170
What did you say?

17:26.587 --> 17:27.838
The accident...

17:28.547 --> 17:29.715
that took their lives...

17:29.798 --> 17:33.260
It would be tragic
if a similar one befell you.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.430
I'm not gonna be baited or bullied by you,

17:36.513 --> 17:39.641
not in the woods and not at the academy.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.226
Stubborn mutt.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.989
What are you doing?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.830
A curse

18:22.017 --> 18:23.393
Succubitches.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.283
Sabrina. Hey, girl.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.411
Stepped in some poison ivy, Roz.
Gotta wash it off me.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.163
Okay.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.085
If truly I am cursed today,
let water wash the hex away.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.546
If truly I am cursed today,
let water wash the hex away.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.469
Susie?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.389
Susie.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.183
What's going on

19:08.021 --> 19:09.565
They pulled up my shirt.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.027
What?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.113
Who did?

19:19.199 --> 19:23.245
It was four of them.
Four troglodyte football players.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.081
They pulled up her shirt,
Principal Hawthorne,

19:26.165 --> 19:29.835
because they wanted to see
if she had breasts.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.421
To see if she was really
a boy or a girl under there.

19:32.629 --> 19:37.467
Well, uh, Miss Spellman,
if you could give me their names,

19:37.551 --> 19:40.012
then I will have them in for review.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.430
Susie wouldn't tell me.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.015
But I can guess.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.226
Or you can bring in
all the football players for questioning.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.061
You're suggesting a witch hunt?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.771
I don't care for that term.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.901
But Susie doesn't feel safe here,
in your school.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.821
She is living in a constant state of fear.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.531
Hmm.

19:59.823 --> 20:05.120
Well, if that is true,
then you, as her friend...

20:05.996 --> 20:06.872
might...

20:07.372 --> 20:09.917
suggest to Miss Putnam that she...

20:11.543 --> 20:12.794
find another school.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.758
Hey, what's up -Some jerks were picking on Susie,

20:17.841 --> 20:22.471
being cruel to her, Harvey.
Calling her a freak, pawing at her.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.931
Assholes. Who were they?

20:24.014 --> 20:27.643
Susie won't tell me their names,
but can you ask around? I'll do the same.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.270
Of course, but 'Brina, these guys,
they'll close ranks.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.105
Especially to someone
not on their bullshit team.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.025
We have to do something,
Harvey, this can't keep happening.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.069
I'm with you, we'll try, I'm just saying--

20:37.152 --> 20:40.781
That there's no way to protect Susie

20:40.864 --> 20:42.783
Not at all.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.080
Perhaps I can be of assistance, Sabrina.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.791
Ms. Wardwell?

20:51.458 --> 20:52.417
Yes?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.963
My heart weeps for your friend.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.926
Such a difficult thing
to be going through.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.303
Yeah, it's this, uh...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.974
this town, this school,
there's a culture of--

21:07.057 --> 21:08.642
Puritanical masculinity?

21:09.309 --> 21:12.104
And Principal Hawthorne
is the most intolerant,

21:12.187 --> 21:16.066
the most buffoonish,
the most misogynist of all.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.611
When will the world learn?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.781
Women should be in charge of everything.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.575
Our assistant principal, Ms. Glover,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.869
she wouldn't turn a blind eye
to what's happening.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.622
I just wish Hawthorne would just--

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
Just what?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.668
Hawthorne's a bully...

21:35.752 --> 21:37.462
and I wish someone would
teach him a lesson.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.632
Why not you?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.845
How would that help Susie?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.348
A fish rots from the head down.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.477
Principal Hawthorne isn't an ally. If...

21:53.020 --> 21:54.896
If he were to take a sabbatical, say,

21:54.980 --> 22:00.110
I suspect you and your friends would
come up with some way to help Susie.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.111
The problem is,

22:01.194 --> 22:05.324
Hawthorne doesn't take sabbaticals
or days off, even.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.828
He's scared of spiders, you know.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.874
Principal Hawthorne is?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.960
Hmm.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.299
Absolutely terrified of them.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.894
A graven image.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.485
The football players are a symptom,
but the disease goes much deeper,

22:41.568 --> 22:43.528
into the bedrock of this school.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.114
So, that's where we fight it, with a club.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.409
For young women.
To meet and bolster each other.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.995
Where we can discuss issues
and problems we're facing

22:52.079 --> 22:54.831
and come up with proactive solutions.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.918
You mean, like,
a club to topple the white patriarchy?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.586
-Wait. What?
-Exactly.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.756
To mobilize and protest
if we need to get political,

23:02.839 --> 23:05.467
to fight when we need to fight,
to defend each other.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.303
So Susie never feels alone,
so none of us do.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.972
Won't Hawthorne block this?
He wouldn't let me start

23:11.056 --> 23:12.974
a Daughters of the Black Panthers club
last year.

23:13.266 --> 23:17.687
I may have a plan for getting this through
without the interference of Hawthorne.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.648
I just need to do it fast.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.816
How fast?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.527
As soon as possible.
But definitely by Friday.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.571
Just in time for your birthday.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.950
Yes, but remember,
we're not making a big deal about that

23:30.033 --> 23:31.535
-this year.
-But it is a big deal.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.287
It's your sweet 16, on Halloween.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.539
There's an eclipse.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.375
I mean, that kind of cosmic alignment
demands a party.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.920
-Harvey, back me up.
-I've tried, Roz, multiple times, but--

23:42.003 --> 23:45.674
But I have plans with my aunts.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.344
Years-in-the-making plans.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.848
It's a super-secret
Spellman family tradition

23:52.931 --> 23:56.560
that I'm not supposed to talk about,
so let's just focus on our club.

23:56.643 --> 23:57.853
What should we call it?

23:58.145 --> 23:59.521
The She-Hawks.

24:04.860 --> 24:09.948
Ah, Stolas. My familiar,
my faithful factotum.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.203
Our Dark Lord is wise.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.708
He senses her attachment
to the mortal world

24:19.791 --> 24:22.461
and has sent us to see
that his will will be done.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.258
And see to it we shall.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.433
Spellman Sisters Mortuary,
how may I assist you?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.310
Oh, no.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.395
Yes, Hilda, what is it?

24:40.604 --> 24:43.064
A young man has just been stabbed.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.277
His mother and father are coming
to see us. Poor, poor dears.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.320
Oh.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.613
Praise Satan.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.492
And do the parents want
an open or closed casket?

24:53.783 --> 24:58.330
We didn't get that far, Zelda.
Their son was just stabbed to death.

24:58.413 --> 25:02.959
Well, even if we can't use his flesh,
we still need blood for Sabrina's baptism,

25:03.043 --> 25:08.173
and human blood is always preferable,
so, the timing couldn't be more perfect.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.133
Hellishly so.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.470
It's-- It's very funny.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.723
Mr. and Mrs. Kemper,
we're so sorry for your loss.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.603
My sister and I will do everything
to make it as painless as possible.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.273
We couldn't have children,
so we had to adopt Connor.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.483
Oh.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.403
Could you make him look like that?

25:35.408 --> 25:36.868
About your birthday, 'Brina.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.663
I know you have this super mysterious
thing with your aunts

25:39.746 --> 25:41.206
you're not allowed to talk about...

25:42.374 --> 25:46.753
but... are you a hundred percent sure
I can't convince you otherwise?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.922
It could just be the two of us...

25:50.215 --> 25:53.802
watching the eclipse together,
waiting for it to get dark.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.430
-Harvey, that sounds like a dream.
-Mm-hmm.

25:57.514 --> 26:02.227
But... this thing, it's...
it's kind of an obligation.

26:04.020 --> 26:08.233
And you really can't tell us,
tell me, anything about it?

26:08.525 --> 26:10.068
Only that it's important...

26:12.153 --> 26:13.321
to my aunts...

26:13.780 --> 26:14.656
and to me.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.659
What's so important
you're gonna miss your birthday for it?

26:19.077 --> 26:21.997
It's not so much
about my birthday. It's...

26:22.998 --> 26:24.791
It's more about what comes after.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.711
That sounds ominous.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.215
I'm moving, Harvey.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.387
I'm leaving Baxter High

26:37.470 --> 26:40.432
and going to a boarding school
in Connecticut.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.475
What?

26:44.060 --> 26:45.353
Are you being serious?

26:45.687 --> 26:49.024
My aunts are dropping me off...
this Friday night.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.942
What the hell
are you talking about, Sabrina?

26:51.026 --> 26:55.655
I'm talking about
this amazing opportunity that I...

26:56.281 --> 26:57.574
I can't say no to.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.660
So amazing
you've never mentioned it to me?

27:00.994 --> 27:02.454
Or to Roz

27:02.537 --> 27:04.956
I didn't want to freak you guys out.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.710
So what Without saying bye?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.171
No, of course not.

27:12.005 --> 27:15.091
Well... what school

27:15.175 --> 27:17.093
Um, it's, uh...

27:19.512 --> 27:20.889
Sorry, I'm blanking.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.558
-Really?
-It's on the tip of my brain.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.687
'Cause I gotta say, 'Brina,
this is all feeling kind of shady.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.400
It's almost like...

27:33.109 --> 27:33.943
What?

27:34.569 --> 27:38.531
I dunno, like you're...
hiding something from me...

27:40.241 --> 27:42.327
which you don't ever have to do.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.829
You know that, right?

27:46.581 --> 27:48.208
No, of course I know that.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.210
You can just...

27:51.252 --> 27:52.295
tell me the truth...

27:53.296 --> 27:54.214
whatever it is...

27:55.131 --> 27:56.174
and it'll be fine.

27:57.884 --> 27:58.802
I...

28:00.845 --> 28:02.222
Seriously, 'Brina.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.849
There's nothing we can't handle,

28:05.308 --> 28:07.185
as long as we're being honest
with each other.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.020
Harvey...

28:10.522 --> 28:11.564
What is it? Tell me.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.908
It might be easier if I showed you.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.452
Okay.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.628
Listen.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.673
I love that sound.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.552
The wind blowing through tree branches.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.182
I think that's my favorite sound
in the whole world.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.061
What did you want to show me?

28:55.567 --> 28:56.651
This place.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.406
It's where I was born, Harvey.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.993
Not in Greendale General. Here.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.829
In this grove of trees.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.831
Almost 16 years ago.

29:14.419 --> 29:19.007
It's also where I'll be reborn
this Friday night.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.635
On my 16th birthday,
at the stroke of midnight,

29:23.386 --> 29:25.013
under an eclipsing blood moon.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.683
I don't understand. Reborn how?

29:30.101 --> 29:35.482
The ceremony's called a dark baptism,
but it's not as bad as it sounds.

29:35.857 --> 29:40.069
It's kind of like when we went to
Shoshanna Feldman's bat mitzvah.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.031
Or Guadalupe Lopez's quinceañera.

29:43.448 --> 29:48.745
I'm leaving my... girlhood behind.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.543
In the woods?

29:57.670 --> 29:58.671
Is that a metaphor?

29:58.755 --> 30:02.425
Harvey, do you remember...
at the beginning of the school year,

30:02.801 --> 30:05.386
what Miss Wardwell told us
about Ye Olde Greendale?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.514
How there were witch trials like in Salem,

30:07.597 --> 30:09.933
but no one ever talked about them
or wrote about them?

30:10.016 --> 30:11.643
There are no gravestones, no monuments?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.186
Hazily, yeah.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.939
That's because
the witches didn't want anyone to know.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.526
So that the coven could keep living
in Greendale,

30:19.609 --> 30:22.821
privately, undisturbed,
through the centuries.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.868
So that we could.

30:29.035 --> 30:29.869
"We."

30:30.495 --> 30:32.997
What are you saying? That you're a--

30:33.081 --> 30:33.957
Half-witch.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.001
On my father's side.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.130
I'm saying that witches are real, Harvey.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.175
And my father was one. A warlock.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.387
And that after this weekend,
after my baptism,

30:47.470 --> 30:49.973
after I sign my name
in the Dark Lord's book,

30:50.056 --> 30:54.018
I'll have to leave Baxter High
and go to the Academy of Unseen Arts...

30:54.102 --> 30:54.936
What?

30:55.019 --> 30:58.064
...and renounce any and all
meaningful connections to mortals.

31:03.778 --> 31:07.198
There are so many delicious things
about being a witch,

31:07.282 --> 31:11.327
but the one really bad thing
is saying goodbye to you

31:11.411 --> 31:13.246
and to Roz and Susie.

31:13.496 --> 31:16.499
I mean-- Are you saying all this
because you don't want to be with me?

31:16.583 --> 31:17.667
Because I said I love you?

31:17.959 --> 31:18.877
No, Harvey, no.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.504
I'm saying this because on Monday morning,

31:21.588 --> 31:24.299
I don't want to suddenly
be gone from your life

31:24.382 --> 31:27.051
and you not know why or blame yourself.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.887
I know it's a lot to take in.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.054
That you're a witch?

31:30.513 --> 31:33.850
Sorry, a half-witch? Yeah. Yeah, it is.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.731
So, forget I said anything.

31:39.814 --> 31:43.735
Harvey, listen to my voice, hear my words,
and forget I said anything.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.362
Bless your mind, bless your heart,
let these painful thoughts depart.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.322
Wait--

31:58.124 --> 31:59.959
-Oh!
-Harvey?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.635
Sabrina, what...

32:10.637 --> 32:11.846
Where are we?

32:12.013 --> 32:13.014
The woods.

32:15.224 --> 32:18.061
We were walking home
and decided to try a different path.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.395
Oh.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.859
-Then?
-Then we got lost for a minute...

32:27.028 --> 32:28.154
but now we're okay.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.157
Good.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.580
Were we talking about something?

32:41.334 --> 32:44.837
I was telling you how I have plans
with my aunts this Halloween.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.427
Hey.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.262
Hey.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.016
-Why so glum? Sabrina.

32:57.141 --> 33:01.020
I was telling Harvey
that I was leaving Baxter High to--

33:01.104 --> 33:03.189
Go to a posh boarding school
in Connecticut?

33:03.272 --> 33:07.193
Yes, but then, I didn't want
to lie to him, Ambrose, so...

33:08.361 --> 33:10.363
I told him I was a witch.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.032
Oh, my.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.910
But it was too wrenching...

33:17.453 --> 33:18.413
so I took it back.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.624
-Wrenching in what way?
-In every way.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.462
This whole situation, it's...
it's impossible.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.382
I love Harvey.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.969
I don't want to say bye to him.
Or my friends.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.517
I wish I could just bring them with me.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.227
Along the Path of Night?

33:43.688 --> 33:44.814
Oh, cousin.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.776
If-- If only I could make things easier
for you.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.611
That's okay.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.406
I'll get through it.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.451
I'll get through it.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.415
But one thing you can do
is help me with a spell later.

34:02.498 --> 34:03.833
To deal with my principal.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.920
So I can set up a club at school
before my baptism.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.839
To protect Susie.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.758
And all the girls.

34:13.593 --> 34:17.638
If I can't stay with them,
at least I can do this one thing.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.018
My grimoire is your grimoire.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.354
And what time will we be spell-casting?

34:26.606 --> 34:28.691
-Midnight-ish.
-The witching hour?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.234
Ooh, spooky.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.079
Oh, Aunt Hilda,
the weird sisters are horrible.

34:41.287 --> 34:45.208
Everyone who goes to the academy
is snobby and horrible and racist.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.710
Why on earth would they curse you
for no reason?

34:47.794 --> 34:49.754
Don't worry, I washed it off me.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.590
-Well, we're gonna check that for sure.
-They're jealous of you.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.052
You're the daughter of a High Priest.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.220
Who are they?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.514
Nobodies.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
But that's precisely
why you need a familiar.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.935
To protect you
from these sorts of attacks.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.436
I tried summoning one.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.814
Break an egg, please, miss.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.649
Better safe than sorry.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.905
Oh. I was right.
That is a blood curse.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.198
Oh, it's lingering.

35:17.448 --> 35:21.786
So, untreated, that is gonna eat
slowly away at your health,

35:21.869 --> 35:23.121
your will, and your sanity.

35:23.621 --> 35:29.001
So, a regimen of salt water baths,
reversing candles for a couple of weeks,

35:29.085 --> 35:30.962
and that will do the trick, I think.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.880
All right, off you go.

35:41.055 --> 35:41.973
Aunties?

35:43.724 --> 35:47.311
The weird sisters said something...
about Mom and Dad.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.480
What did they say
about your mother and father?

35:50.064 --> 35:51.149
Their accident.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.860
They were almost implying
that it wasn't an accident.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.863
-Well, that's just poppycock.
-Yeah.

35:57.196 --> 35:59.407
Your father and mother
were flying to Italy.

35:59.490 --> 36:03.369
Edward was giving a lecture at the Vatican
when their plane went down.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.787
Tragically.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.333
Now get upstairs and into a bath
like your Aunt Hilda says.

36:53.127 --> 36:53.961
Mom?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.047
Dad?

36:58.007 --> 36:59.258
Wait!

37:09.810 --> 37:11.354
Mom

37:12.230 --> 37:13.356
Are you coming?

37:13.439 --> 37:14.732
To my baptism?

37:15.066 --> 37:17.235
I've taken your names,
I hope that's all right.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.779
This isn't like you, cousin,

38:01.862 --> 38:04.365
using witchcraft
to settle personal vendettas.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.701
These are desperate times, Ambrose.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.996
Now remember, I don't want
to kill Principal Hawthorne,

38:10.079 --> 38:12.081
I just need to give him a good scare.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.793
Ms. Wardwell told me
he's terrified of spiders.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.211
Oh, that's easy, then.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.799
It's lucky that Aunt Hilda keeps them
as her familiars.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.478
Are you sure you don't want to kill him?
Because we could do that.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.356
Nope. I just need him to take
a day or two off from school.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.985
Right. Well, we'll only mildly
traumatize him, then.

38:49.327 --> 38:54.707
Spider, O Spider, pray why do you spin
your pretty white web so fine and so thin?

38:54.790 --> 38:57.418
To catch fat flies
and make them into pies.

38:57.793 --> 39:04.550
Spider, O spider, pray, do you not see?
Here comes a big, buzzing, blundering bee.

39:05.384 --> 39:09.513
He'll spoil your fine net
while you fume and you fret,

39:09.889 --> 39:13.851
but no mercy you grant,
and no mercy you'll get.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.162
Oh, no.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.622
What now?

40:23.587 --> 40:24.964
Sabrina.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.637
Who--

40:32.513 --> 40:33.472
Who are you?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.018
Show yourself.

40:38.811 --> 40:41.355
I heard you calling in the woods.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.236
And I came.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.616
Aw!

40:58.998 --> 41:00.666
Such a pretty kitty.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.252
What's your name?

41:10.092 --> 41:11.844
I don't understand you, niece.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.722
You'd rather a feral familiar
than one bred for service?

41:15.097 --> 41:18.434
Salem doesn't serve me, Aunt Zee.
We're in a partnership.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.436
He'll protect me, I'll protect him.

41:20.519 --> 41:23.272
Drink up, darling.
I put a bit of cinnamon in it this time.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.816
And why did you name him Salem
of all things?

41:25.900 --> 41:28.277
I didn't. He named himself Salem.

41:28.527 --> 41:32.907
At least you have your familiar now.
And you're purifying yourself.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.700
Yeah, you're almost ready
for your baptism.

41:35.743 --> 41:36.869
About that.

41:39.079 --> 41:42.500
So, I'm in the middle of getting
this club started at school.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.043
Club

41:44.126 --> 41:47.922
Women protecting women.
You know, sort of like a coven.

41:49.131 --> 41:54.553
Anyway, I was wondering if we could maybe,
possibly postpone my baptism a little bit.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.056
-Postpone it?
-Oh, dear.

41:57.139 --> 42:00.142
Sabrina, you cannot postpone
your 16th birthday,

42:00.226 --> 42:02.394
especially not when it falls
on the eclipsing of a blood moon

42:02.478 --> 42:05.231
which only occurs once every 66 years.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.026
If it's just about a club, dear--

42:09.109 --> 42:10.903
It's not, Aunt Hilda.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.280
There's also the Harvey of it all.

42:14.406 --> 42:17.201
We very recently took things
to the next level.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.328
He hasn't defiled you, has he?

42:20.162 --> 42:23.666
Witch law forbids novitiates
from being anything less than virginal.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.543
-Oh, wow.
-Aunt Zelda.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.586
Not that it's anyone's business, but no.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.755
Praise Satan.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.549
However, now that you bring it up,

42:31.632 --> 42:35.177
I admit, I have reservations
about saving myself for the Dark Lord.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.179
Why does he get to decide
what I do with my body?

42:37.263 --> 42:39.223
Because it is witch law. Covenant.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.307
Okay, but why?

42:42.393 --> 42:45.437
And if you don't know, maybe I can talk
to someone before my baptism,

42:45.521 --> 42:49.066
someone who can help me understand these
things so I can make an educated choice.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.109
Choice?

42:50.776 --> 42:54.113
It is our sacred duty and honor
to serve the Dark Lord.

42:54.196 --> 42:56.782
The extraordinary,
delicious gifts he bestows on us

42:56.865 --> 42:58.659
in return for signing his book.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.829
-And you, you would deny him that?
-It's my name, Aunt Zelda.

43:01.912 --> 43:05.291
We all signed the book,
and proudly, I might add.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.334
This is your mother's influence.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.045
Zelda, calm down. Your blood pressure.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.463
This is your fault too.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.008
We should've home-schooled her,
as is our custom.

43:14.091 --> 43:19.597
Sabrina, do you not want to join
the Church of Night as a full member?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.807
I think so, I just don't know why

43:21.890 --> 43:25.102
I have to give up everything in my life
that's human to do it.

43:25.185 --> 43:28.439
Witch law. The Path of Night
or the Path of Light.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.190
But not both.

43:30.274 --> 43:33.527
And yet, my father, a warlock,
married my mother,

43:33.611 --> 43:34.528
and she was human.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.656
Yes, and it very nearly
got Edward excommunicated.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.951
Which begs the question,
why would I want to join an organization

43:41.035 --> 43:43.037
that would do that
to anyone I cared about?

43:43.120 --> 43:45.039
Because it's what they wanted for you.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.502
Isn't that right, Hilda?

43:51.920 --> 43:53.964
Didn't Edward and Diana both say so?

43:54.465 --> 43:57.176
Yeah, they-- they did, lamb. Many times.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.637
You are a Daughter of the Church of Night.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.722
Your father was a High Priest.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.224
You will be baptized under a blood moon,

44:04.516 --> 44:07.895
as we were,
as all the Spellmans before you were,

44:07.978 --> 44:10.981
as your children will be.
And that, niece, is final.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.115
Let me ask you,

44:20.741 --> 44:23.994
that spell we cast on Hawthorne
last night, you enjoyed that?

44:24.411 --> 44:26.497
From the glint in your eye, you loved it.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.666
Yes. Of course.

44:29.208 --> 44:33.087
You realize that your gifts, that euphoria
fade to nothing if you aren't baptized.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.129
I know.

44:35.547 --> 44:37.883
I just... need to be sure.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.388
In that case, you need to get
your hands on a malum malus.

44:42.471 --> 44:45.182
-What's a malum malus?
-It depends on who's translating.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.476
If it's a man, it's the apple of evil.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.229
If it's a woman,
it's the fruit of knowledge.

44:50.729 --> 44:51.897
What do you do with it?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.149
It's an apple, Sabrina, you bite it.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.904
And it whispers secrets to you.

44:59.905 --> 45:01.281
Grants you knowledge.

45:01.865 --> 45:04.284
Sometimes it might show you
a glimpse of the future.

45:04.576 --> 45:07.413
"Should you walk the Path of Night
or the Path of Light?"

45:08.163 --> 45:12.418
The malum malus might
illuminate one path over another.

45:13.585 --> 45:16.422
-Is that interesting to you?
-Yes, I'm interested.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.341
Go to an orchard, find the oldest tree.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.970
It'll have one. The older the tree,
the more it's seen,

45:23.053 --> 45:26.432
the more it knows, the more accurate
its reading of the future will be.

45:27.015 --> 45:27.891
Groovy.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.936
And make sure there are no worms in it.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.417
A malum malus?

45:55.627 --> 45:59.965
And what, Stolas,
if the malum shows the half-breed

46:00.048 --> 46:02.760
something that dissuades her
from her baptism?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.972
Our Dark Lord wouldn't like that,
would he?

46:09.975 --> 46:11.185
Hi, Mrs. Meeks.

46:12.352 --> 46:15.606
Rosalind and I were wondering,
is Principal Hawthorne in yet?

46:16.607 --> 46:19.401
Um... Principal Hawthorne
won't be coming in today.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.530
He's had a... shock.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.199
Shoot.

46:25.282 --> 46:28.994
Rosalind and I have a club proposal
we were hoping to get approved today.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.413
In Mr. Hawthorne's absence,

46:31.497 --> 46:35.709
Assistant Principal Glover would,
I suppose...

46:36.376 --> 46:38.962
be empowered to review such applications.

46:41.715 --> 46:44.885
Hawthorne has never been sick
a day in his life.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.387
What did you do,
stick pins in a voodoo doll?

46:57.773 --> 46:58.857
-Yes!

46:58.941 --> 47:00.943
Susie! Come on! We need help!

47:01.193 --> 47:02.027
Okay.

47:05.072 --> 47:08.367
You guys, you aren't doing
all this just for me, are you?

47:08.450 --> 47:12.830
For all of us. Fifty-three percent of
Baxter High is female, Susie.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.623
The school needs a club like this.

47:14.706 --> 47:18.043
It's long overdue, girl.
But, yes, if anyone messes with you again,

47:18.126 --> 47:21.255
you'll have a recognized,
legitimate sisterhood backing you up.

47:21.839 --> 47:25.133
-And the name, WICCA?
-Rosalind came up with it.

47:25.217 --> 47:30.055
WICCA.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.768
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

47:34.852 --> 47:37.938
And the more girls who join,
the harder we'll be to silence.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.607
That call was for you, Sabrina.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.651
Ms. Wardwell has asked
to see you in her office.

47:46.989 --> 47:51.535
Assistant Principal Glover
tells me she's ratified your organization

47:51.618 --> 47:55.664
and that on the application,
I was listed as faculty advisor.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.042
-I hope that's okay, Ms. Wardwell.
-Happy to do it.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.045
Especially if this club gives you

48:02.129 --> 48:04.339
the peace of mind
you're so clearly craving.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.259
It'll help. At least on this one front.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.635
Oh, is there...

48:09.636 --> 48:11.680
Is there something else bothering you?

48:12.890 --> 48:14.349
Weighing on you?

48:15.517 --> 48:18.562
-If I can be honest with you...
-Oh, absolutely.

48:19.354 --> 48:23.567
...there is a possibility
of me going to a different school,

48:23.650 --> 48:28.780
a private school, but I'm not
100 percent sure it's something I want.

48:30.115 --> 48:32.618
Well, is, um-- Is it a good school?

48:32.701 --> 48:34.202
One of the best.

48:34.286 --> 48:38.123
And, complicating matters,
my dad went to this school.

48:38.206 --> 48:41.585
Then why wouldn't you go?

48:41.668 --> 48:46.381
Mind you, not that I want to see
my prize pupil vanishing on me.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.218
This wouldn't be about a boy, would it?

48:51.178 --> 48:55.140
I've noticed how enamored you are
with Mr. Kinkle.

48:55.223 --> 48:59.436
Harvey's a part of it, sure,
but it's everything.

49:00.312 --> 49:01.647
All my life is in Greendale.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.359
It's proving difficult
to untangle myself from that.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.322
Well, um...

49:11.531 --> 49:13.450
this merits further discussion.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.786
Why don't you and I get together
after school

49:15.869 --> 49:20.332
and see if we can't untangle
this Gordian knot together?

49:20.415 --> 49:23.710
I'd love that, Ms. Wardwell,
but I have plans after school.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.421
-Oh?
-I'm going apple picking.

49:27.130 --> 49:28.715
Ha! How fun.

49:29.716 --> 49:30.884
Where would that be?

50:11.842 --> 50:13.885
-It doesn't fit.
-Well, it will.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.595
-Then we can color it in.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.848
What's the point?
I don't even know why I bother.

50:17.931 --> 50:20.183
-There's something you should see.
-Mmm?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.476
In the embalming room.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.231
So dramatic.

50:28.191 --> 50:31.653
-It's a birthmark.
-Except I poked it, and...

50:41.163 --> 50:42.539
Oh, that doesn't bleed.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.043
That's a witch's mark, then.

50:46.251 --> 50:49.129
Or it's simply that his blood started
to settle in his buttocks.

50:49.212 --> 50:52.174
But if it is a witch's mark
and Connor here was murdered...

50:52.257 --> 50:53.550
A witch hunter?

50:54.009 --> 50:55.010
Is that possible?

50:55.093 --> 50:56.762
Might be worth bringing up
to the Council.

50:57.095 --> 50:59.681
Yet another reason Sabrina needs
to join the Church of the Night.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.099
So she's protected.

51:02.392 --> 51:06.354
-Witches without covens are easy pickings.
-I've been praying on that, Zelda,

51:06.438 --> 51:11.735
and I just think that if she wants to talk
to someone, an outside opinion--

51:11.818 --> 51:15.489
Who would you have her talk to, Hilda

51:15.572 --> 51:16.531
No.

51:17.365 --> 51:22.746
No, but I just-- I feel like,
as close to him as reasonably possible.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.502
-Finish the embalming. Carefully.
-Hmm.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.629
We'll need every single drop of blood

51:30.712 --> 51:33.048
for Sabrina's anointment
during the baptism.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.675
Shame they decided
against a closed casket.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.762
We haven't had long pig for dinner
in ages.

52:22.681 --> 52:25.142
Hey, I should probably get a pumpkin
for my stoop,

52:25.225 --> 52:26.935
in case we get any trick-or-treaters.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.605
-Your aunts don't need any more, do they?
-No, Harvey. I think they're covered.

52:30.689 --> 52:31.648
Okay.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.878
Nothing's ever easy, is it?

53:04.598 --> 53:06.516
Hickery Pickery, Hickery Pickery,

53:06.600 --> 53:07.851
where shall this girl go?

53:08.101 --> 53:11.146
She'll go east, she'll go west,
she'll go to the crow's nest.

53:11.771 --> 53:14.482
Hickery Pickery, Hickery Pickery.

53:51.978 --> 53:52.854
Wait.

54:22.175 --> 54:26.179
There will be no apple picking for you,
my dear.

54:56.042 --> 54:57.794
-Salem.

54:57.877 --> 54:59.629
Oh, my God.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.842
Well done. Good boy.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.970
Who-- Who sent that?

55:07.595 --> 55:09.014
Was it the weird sisters?

55:11.683 --> 55:14.269
Okay, well, can you help me
get through the maze?

55:14.519 --> 55:16.479
-To the tree?

55:44.591 --> 55:47.510
How will I know, Salem,
which apple is the...

55:53.183 --> 55:54.893
the malum malus?

56:16.664 --> 56:17.624
Malum...

56:19.542 --> 56:21.169
should I be baptized?

57:39.873 --> 57:41.040
-Hey.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.501
Pumpkins are in the truck.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.336
Why didn't you wait for me?

57:45.628 --> 57:47.630
Aw!

57:48.089 --> 57:50.133
-Who's this little guy?

57:50.675 --> 57:51.551
Um...

57:52.051 --> 57:52.969
A stray.

57:53.928 --> 57:54.846
I'm taking him home.

57:55.763 --> 57:59.476
I never really thought of you
as a cat person, but... okay.

58:11.821 --> 58:12.655
Salem?

58:30.173 --> 58:31.341
Aunties?

58:32.008 --> 58:33.218
Ambrose?

58:33.927 --> 58:38.139
Can we please have a family meeting?
I've made a decision about my baptism.

58:40.141 --> 58:42.477
Sabrina. We're in here.

58:58.368 --> 59:01.246
-Is this the child?
-It is, Your Excellency.

59:02.205 --> 59:04.082
This is our niece, Sabrina.

59:10.838 --> 59:14.217
Oh, my child. You have no idea
how special you are, do you?

59:14.717 --> 59:16.261
How you've been chosen.

59:17.679 --> 59:19.472
Sorry, do I know you?

59:19.889 --> 59:23.351
Honestly. Forgive her, Father,
she knows not what she says.

59:23.434 --> 59:26.354
Sabrina, we are being honored tonight.

59:26.688 --> 59:28.648
This is Faustus Blackwood.

59:30.024 --> 59:32.819
He's High Priest of the Church of Night.

59:34.070 --> 59:37.865
Dark Lord Satan's representative on earth.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.285
Your aunts tell me
you're having doubts about your baptism.

59:41.119 --> 59:44.914
That you may, in fact, not be signing
your name in the Book of the Beast.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.750
-Uh...
-No, no, no. That cannot be.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.044
That must not be.

59:51.629 --> 59:52.463
So...

59:54.507 --> 59:57.885
let us see what I can do to convince you.

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:03.701
Brett, move your head.
