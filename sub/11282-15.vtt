CHRIS ROCK:
Before Cops was a show on TV,

00:05.639 --> 00:07.741
I saw cops chasing
criminals every day

00:07.775 --> 00:09.743
on the streets in Bed-Stuy.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.745
Some of the criminals
were fast.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.747
Come on. Let's go!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.252
* Annie, are you okay?

00:18.286 --> 00:20.121
* So, Annie, are you okay...

00:20.154 --> 00:21.522
Some of them were fast,

00:21.555 --> 00:23.557
then slow.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.527
And no matter what you saw,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.529
the most important thing
was to not get involved.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.701
* Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie? *

00:33.734 --> 00:35.236
* Annie, are you okay...?

00:35.269 --> 00:37.238
Hold this.
What is it?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.106
What you think it is?

00:38.139 --> 00:40.541
And you better have it
when I get back!

00:40.574 --> 00:43.177
* ...He came
into your apartment *

00:43.211 --> 00:44.512
* Left the bloodstains
on the carpet... *

00:44.545 --> 00:46.180
Hey, where's the weed, T.J.?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.315
I ain't got no weed, man!

00:47.348 --> 00:48.349
Yeah, right.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.818
Where's the weed, T.J.?

00:50.851 --> 00:52.853
I had never actually
seen real marijuana.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.190
But after having a bag of it
shoved into my hands,

00:56.224 --> 00:58.192
I knew one thing:
Where's the weed, T.J.?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.328
if that's what happened to the
guy who didn't have the weed,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.430
I didn't want to know
what would happen

01:02.463 --> 01:04.698
to the guy who did have it.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.447
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.701
A bag of weed can cause you
all kinds of problems:

01:40.734 --> 01:42.703
big ones, like losing your job;

01:42.736 --> 01:45.206
and little ones, like trying
to figure out where to hide it.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.709
I thought about hiding it
in the bathroom.

01:48.742 --> 01:52.246
* Mary Jane...

01:54.415 --> 01:57.885
Who's hiding $27 worth of weed
in the toilet?!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.753
* I'm in love
with Mary Jane... *

01:59.787 --> 02:01.489
I thought about hiding it
in my room.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.757
* She's my main thing...

02:03.791 --> 02:05.426
Mama!

02:05.459 --> 02:08.329
Somebody hid some weed
in Chris' sock drawer!

02:08.362 --> 02:11.332
I even thought about hiding it
in the kitchen.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.168
* She comes as no surprise...

02:14.202 --> 02:17.305
Who hid weed in my cereal?!

02:17.338 --> 02:20.308
But I decided the safest place
to hide it

02:20.341 --> 02:23.177
was on me.

02:23.211 --> 02:26.180
Even though I hid the weed,
I couldn't hide the smell.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.184
What is that?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.319
What is what?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.886
That smell.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.888
I don't smell
anything.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.524
Maybe it's the greens.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.725
If you can't smell
anything,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.360
how do you know
it's the greens?

02:40.428 --> 02:41.662
That's not greens.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.364
Oh, it's greens, all right.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.732
It smells like
it's coming from under

02:44.765 --> 02:45.833
the table.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.537
It smells

02:49.570 --> 02:51.405
like weed.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.316
How do you know
what weed smells like?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.884
Scratch 'n sniff
Rick James sticker?

03:03.917 --> 03:06.387
I think I might have smelled it
at the record store.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.488
What record store?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.822
The Jamaican record store.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.359
I went there to get
the new Lisa Lisa album.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.666
Ya, mon, check back next week!

03:20.268 --> 03:22.303
How many times do I have
to tell you kids,

03:22.336 --> 03:24.272
the Jamaicans do not sell
records?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.440
Or if they do,
they're Sean Paul.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.008
What were you doing
over there anyway?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.510
Andrea is having
a listening party

03:29.543 --> 03:31.445
for the new Lisa Lisa
and Cult Jam album.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.381
And I wanted the album
so I would know the songs.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.315
But it's not out yet.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.584
She was such a big fan
of Lisa Lisa,

03:36.617 --> 03:38.752
for a while we had to call her
Tonya Tonya.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.987
Party

03:40.020 --> 03:41.422
Wednesday
after school.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.956
Can I go?
No.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.893
My father hardly ever said no
to Tonya,

03:45.926 --> 03:47.561
so we were more shocked
than she was.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.397
What?
What?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.898
Tonya, change your tone.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.932
How come I can't go?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.334
It's just Andrea's.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.035
I can't sleep if I know
you're not home.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.937
I said no. That's it.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.307
That look means,
"We'll see about that."

03:59.340 --> 04:01.875
Keeping weed on me

04:01.909 --> 04:03.911
didn't seem like
such a great idea,

04:03.944 --> 04:06.947
so I decided to just
keep it near me.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.402
Back at school,
I had Jamaican Gold in my shoe

04:28.436 --> 04:30.404
and Italian Greg on my case.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.406
Are you crazy
bringing that here?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.308
I couldn't
leave it at home.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.776
Well, you're gonna be leaving
everything at home

04:35.809 --> 04:37.445
when you end up in jail.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.712
Why didn't you just
throw it away?

04:40.748 --> 04:43.717
Because he knows who I am,
and knows where I work--

04:43.751 --> 04:45.719
plus he said that
when he comes back,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.054
I better have it.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.056
What difference does it make
what he says?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.058
He's going to jail.
And when he gets out,

04:51.091 --> 04:52.826
this weed's gonna be
right there at Doc's
waiting for him.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.495
I don't care if it
takes 20 years.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.629
It might be legal by then.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.465
Well, you can't keep it
in that sock.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.499
You smell like the ocean.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.433
I have no where
else to put it.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.602
Some drug mules would beg
to differ.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.604
I'll get you
something.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.440
Meet me in the bathroom
before lunch.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.010
Hey, girl.

05:10.043 --> 05:10.944
Hey!

05:10.978 --> 05:12.413
What's all this?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.614
I got you a computer.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.483
A computer

05:15.516 --> 05:17.485
To keep the salon organized.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.354
It holds customer information,
appointments,

05:20.388 --> 05:22.656
calculate our accounts
receivable and payable.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.358
It does just about
everything but hair.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.959
Oh, I don't need a computer.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.495
Girl, I'm a walking computer.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.829
But I'm not.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
Girl, I don't even know
what's going on

05:30.498 --> 05:31.799
in my own salon anymore.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.401
Sounds like my father.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.536
Try it! You'll like it.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.571
That sounds like my father,
too.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.475
While my mom was entering
the computer age,

05:41.509 --> 05:44.478
Greg was contemplating
the stoned age.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.514
Chris?

05:46.547 --> 05:47.681
Yeah?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.683
Hey, up top.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.685
What's this?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.487
It's a kitchen
container.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.755
It's airtight.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.590
That way it keeps
all the freshness in,

05:56.624 --> 05:58.959
but it keeps the smells
from getting out.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.127
Hey, by the way.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.695
I got an idea.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.397
Maybe we should just smoke it.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.865
You know, get rid
of all the evidence.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.549
Are you high?

06:21.582 --> 06:22.616
I'm trying to hide
the evidence,

06:22.650 --> 06:23.751
not be the evidence.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.453
What about T.J.?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.088
Look, every moment you have
that weed in your possession,

06:28.121 --> 06:30.924
you increase the statistical
chances of getting caught.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.593
You could go to jail.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.061
If we smoke it,
it's gone.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.563
I'm gonna not do
that, all right?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.431
I'm gonna take my chances
not being high.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.667
Somewhere, Bobby Brown said,
"This show is ridiculous,"

06:39.700 --> 06:41.669
and changed the channel.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.203
While I was holding weed,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.439
my mother was about
to hold a grudge.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.475
Hey, Peaches.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.442
Hi!

06:48.476 --> 06:50.444
Whatcha you doing here?

06:50.478 --> 06:51.545
Vanessa said

06:51.579 --> 06:54.515
that she would give me a
discount on my next touch-up

06:54.548 --> 06:56.650
if I showed you all your way
around the computer.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.919
Rochelle, this girl, she
knows what she is doing.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.588
Most people, they get
out of prison--

07:00.621 --> 07:01.589
they end up back
in jail.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.757
This girl is gonna end up
running a company.

07:03.791 --> 07:07.461
Well, it can't be too hard
if you learned it in prison.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.630
You know, a lot
of people think

07:09.663 --> 07:11.064
when you're in prison,
all you learn

07:11.098 --> 07:12.500
is how to be
a better criminal.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.101
But if you stay positive
and motivated,

07:14.134 --> 07:15.135
you can learn anything
in there.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.971
You could become a lawyer.
You could get in shape.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.007
I'm telling you, my prison
was better than school.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.174
How would she know?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
She's never been to school.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.977
Well, that's okay.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.846
I could do it.
You know, uh,
Ow. Ooh.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.081
I like to get a feel
for things myself.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.250
I'm more of a...
a hands-on type.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.486
She's more
the hands-on-your-neck type.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.388
Oh!

07:35.422 --> 07:38.125
While the weed was burning
a hole in my gym bag,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.494
I was hoping
not to burn my lasagna.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.662
Remember:

07:41.695 --> 07:45.633
this dish will count as 50%
towards your final grade.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.501
How's your lasagna, Chris?

07:47.535 --> 07:48.736
Great. I'm just putting
the finishing touches

07:48.769 --> 07:49.903
on the sauce.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.004
How's your angel food cake?

07:51.038 --> 07:54.074
It's gonna be
just like me...

07:55.609 --> 07:57.611
...sweet and light

07:57.645 --> 07:59.647
and everybody'll
want a piece.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.114
If everyone is George Michael.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.850
Whatever you say.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.518
Ay bendito,

08:04.552 --> 08:06.053
hold me!

08:06.086 --> 08:08.221
Angel, please let me go.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.591
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.659
So am I.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.926
Please let me go.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
MAN:
Ma'am.
Oh, come on in.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.930
What's going on?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.099
Oh, looks like a
random drug raid.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.868
Drug raid?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.737
There's a lot of people getting
high in school these days.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.106
That's why they call it
high school.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.008
But they didn't announce
they were gonna do this.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.010
That's why it's called
a raid, papi.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.779
Class,

08:31.812 --> 08:33.881
this is K-9
Officer Kilo.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.684
Now, there's no reason
to be afraid.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.686
He doesn't bite
unless he's ordered to.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.320
He's better behaved
than Naomi Campbell.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.823
We're just here
to do a walk-through.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.925
Just keep your places.
We'll be done in a sec.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.565
They either had weed or John
Mayer was playing outside.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.235
OFFICER:
Get him!

08:56.604 --> 08:58.872
Hold on here.
Get back here!

09:01.909 --> 09:05.613
This was gonna be the lasagna
that bakes you back.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.623
Now I had two problems.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.625
The guy's weed was
in a lasagna.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.359
And I had a lasagna
full of weed.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.595
Ooh, that looks
delicious!

09:21.629 --> 09:23.764
I would've thought you would
fry up some chicken,

09:23.797 --> 09:24.932
but this is a real surprise.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.301
Leave your dishes
at your stations.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.937
I'm gonna wrap
and label this

09:29.970 --> 09:31.972
and keep them
in the freezer for Friday.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.641
Friday

09:33.674 --> 09:36.276
It's a movie about weed
with Ice Cube and Chris Tucker.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.646
The faculty will be judging
your dishes this year.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.681
And you're representing
your class.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.115
And that's my ass.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.784
While I worried
about prison bars,

09:43.817 --> 09:46.620
my mother struggled
to become Bill Gates.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.622
Hey, Mom.
Hey!

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
Hey!

09:50.691 --> 09:52.793
What are you guys doing here?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.027
Peaches told us
we can come

09:54.061 --> 09:55.696
and she'll show us
how to work the computer.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.665
One day, everybody is
gonna have one of these.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.099
No reason they can't get
a head start.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.669
Um, I'm a little busy right now.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.136
Oh, come on, Ma.
Can we try it, please?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.805
Girl, go ahead.
Let 'em try.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.139
After a few minutes
with Peaches,

10:06.173 --> 10:08.275
they'll be teaching you things.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.810
Go on.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.278
But just a minute.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.646
Oh, what are
you doing

10:12.680 --> 10:13.781
with these manuals?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.816
Funny!

10:18.051 --> 10:20.053
Can I talk you
for a minute?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.026
Do you have a problem with me?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.261
What? No.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.362
Why would you
ask me that?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.165
Because you keep embarrassing me
in front of people.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.767
And Peaches is
in there acting like

10:33.801 --> 10:35.002
she's Albert Einstein
with my kids.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.170
Now, if you want
to replace me,

10:37.204 --> 10:38.405
then just say so.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.741
Rochelle,
you're being ridiculous.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.776
How would you feel if I bought
a computer here that

10:42.810 --> 10:45.746
knew how to do hair and she knew
how to work it and you didn't?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.815
Rochelle, you sound like
a crazy woman.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.216
Now, if you
don't want her

10:49.249 --> 10:50.918
helping with the
computer, fine.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.720
But you better learn it fast,
'cause the person that

10:52.753 --> 10:55.856
manages this store is going
to be working on that computer.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.859
While my mother was getting
the lowdown from Vanessa,

10:58.892 --> 11:01.394
I was trying not to get
the whole faculty high.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.264
Hey, I know you.
You're that black kid.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.367
How'd you like
to make a five spot?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.870
I'd like that.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.772
I need to get
into the Home Ec room.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.206
I left something in there.
Sure.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.374
What'd you leave?

11:14.407 --> 11:17.410
I'd rather not say.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.146
Let's just say

11:19.179 --> 11:21.849
we left five bucks
in there.
Oh.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.216
:
Five bucks.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.085
That's good.
That's very clever.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.958
Hey, where are you going?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.794
I'm going to Andrea's
listening party.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.062
Dad said you couldn't go.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.396
:
"Dad said you couldn't go."

11:36.429 --> 11:38.766
Dad is asleep
and Mama's at work.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.400
As long as I get home
before Daddy wakes up,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.736
and you keep your mouth shut
and stay out of my business,

11:42.770 --> 11:44.404
then we shouldn't
have a problem.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.773
A'ight.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.107
When a person says "a'ight,"

11:47.140 --> 11:48.876
that means,
"Do what you want,

11:48.909 --> 11:51.178
but I'm telling you
it's a bad idea."

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
Mr. President, I'm telling you,
I think hiring

11:53.814 --> 11:57.785
this Lewinsky girl
is a bad idea.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.486
CLINTON :
I don't care what you think.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.889
I want her on the clock
Monday morning.

12:01.922 --> 12:02.923
Got me?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.925
A'ight.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.261
While Tonya was breaking out,
I was breaking in.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.130
Oh, man,
where's all the food?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.199
Mrs. Williams had me move it
over to the cafeteria freezer.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.501
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

12:14.534 --> 12:17.170
Listen here,
Mr. I'd-Rather-Not-Say,

12:17.204 --> 12:18.839
how do I know
what you're looking for?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.808
Blame yourself.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.042
Well, can you let us
into the cafeteria kitchen?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.477
No, only the chef
has those keys now.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.480
I think you're going
to need a Plan B.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.282
As in "bail" money.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.988
I always believed that drugs
could destroy your life

12:35.022 --> 12:36.489
because I wasn't even
using them

12:36.523 --> 12:38.458
and my life was getting worse
by the day.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.127
The next time we're
going to see that lasagna

12:40.160 --> 12:41.895
is when the faculty
is eating it.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.864
If only we could pull
an Indiana Jones,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.532
like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.534
You mean when he swaps the bag
of sand for a statue?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.202
Yeah, the old bait-and-switch.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.871
All right,
I guess I can make

12:50.904 --> 12:52.439
another lasagna, but how
are we going to switch that

12:52.472 --> 12:53.673
with the weed lasagna
without anybody seeing?

12:53.706 --> 12:57.811
See the answer in Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Weed.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.146
Hey.
* Baby, I think I love you

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
Hey, what's up, Julius?
* From head to toe

13:01.314 --> 13:02.515
Have you heard

13:02.549 --> 13:04.551
of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam?
Oh, that's it.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.988
Ooh, that song is hotter
than grits on Al Green, baby.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.990
Look, I need that
album for Tonya.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.391
She wanted to hear it
at a listening party,

13:11.424 --> 13:12.860
but I wouldn't let her go.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.494
I can't let her be
the only girl on the block

13:14.527 --> 13:16.864
that hasn't heard it.
Oh, man, you're in luck.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.969
Shoot, this came out
yesterday in limited release.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.270
He released it
from the back of a truck.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.505
And the only people
that are listening to it

13:25.538 --> 13:27.274
are listening parties and me.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.176
And you're lucky.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.913
I love $12 more
than I love Lisa Lisa.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.481
My dad was wondering
if he could just have

13:34.514 --> 13:36.249
one Lisa for half the price.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.517
* From head to toe

13:37.550 --> 13:38.986
Ha-ha! Here you go.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.420
All right, thank you.
Enjoy, brother.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.955
* I love you
from head to toe... *

13:41.989 --> 13:44.091
Back at home, my mother
was about to find out

13:44.124 --> 13:46.026
about something
she didn't know.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.627
Mmm, that smells good.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.930
It's lasagna.
Chris made it.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.364
I didn't know he
could make lasagna.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.366
Yeah, he learned
in Home Ec.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.935
One is for us,
and the other,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.870
he has to take
back to his school.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.371
So don't eat it.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.873
Where are you going?

13:59.907 --> 14:00.941
I'm going to register

14:00.974 --> 14:04.077
for computer class
at the Learning Skills Annex.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.914
How much is that
going to cost?
Not much.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.349
Drew and Tonya said Peaches
was teaching them the computer.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.984
How come she can't teach you?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.286
:
* Ooh, baby,
I think I love you *

14:13.320 --> 14:15.989
* From head to toe.
Peaches only knows a little.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.657
I need to learn
about programming.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.526
Oh, no, she knows
all about that.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.461
She designed this program
that lets her log in

14:21.494 --> 14:23.931
all her community
service hours.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.533
Baby, if Peaches can
teach you for free,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.001
how come I'm paying
for classes?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.502
'Cause you're not
married to Peaches.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.238
Now, can I take my class
or would you rather

14:31.271 --> 14:33.306
me get locked up
and learn in jail?

14:33.340 --> 14:35.408
He's seriously
thinking about this.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.177
Hey, it's okay.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.545
Take your classes.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.183
At school the next day,
I had to stop the cook-off

14:43.216 --> 14:45.252
from turning into a bake-off.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.553
We have to create
a diversion.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.055
Nobody will be paying
attention and it'll be

14:48.088 --> 14:49.256
the perfect time
to switch the lasagnas.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.162
Are you serious?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.329
As a heart attack.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.198
Wait for my signal.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.971
And now, I'd like to begin
the tasting.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.106
Come on.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.015
I bet you
you would've.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.355
Okay, this is not
a scheduled alarm.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.024
I need everyone
to evacuate

15:24.057 --> 15:27.494
in an orderly fashion.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.074
Chris, come on!

15:41.108 --> 15:42.976
You might be black,
but you're not fireproof.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.045
Leave that bag there.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.683
GREG:
Chris!

15:51.751 --> 15:53.153
What took you so long?

15:53.186 --> 15:54.587
Just wanted to make sure
nobody saw me.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.623
Cool.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.161
Meanwhile, my mother was paying
for computer classes

16:01.194 --> 16:02.662
to save her pride.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.299
Hi, class!

16:07.334 --> 16:09.569
Welcome
to Computer Love Lesson.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.438
I Peaches!

16:11.471 --> 16:13.573
Y'all know y'all don't
know nothing, right?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.775
I managed to get the lasagna
out of school.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.312
Now all I had to do was make
sure me and T.J. were cool.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.580
T.J.:
Hey!

16:20.613 --> 16:22.415
I want my stuff.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.184
And you bet not have
smoked none.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.054
Oh, I didn't smoke it.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.089
I, uh, baked it.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.496
There you go.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.367
Hmm-hmm...

16:40.400 --> 16:42.069
So let me get
this straight.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.337
You didn't want to learn
the computer from me,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.806
but then I catch you

16:46.839 --> 16:48.175
trying to learn it
from somebody else.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.443
Peaches, you're the one
teaching me.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.379
You didn't know
it was going to be me.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.646
How could you do this, Rochelle?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.482
I am your friend.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.184
I didn't want
you to think

16:57.217 --> 16:59.086
that I wasn't smart
enough to learn it.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.420
Why come?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.055
'Cause I learned it
in a prison?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.490
No.
Yes!

17:03.523 --> 17:04.624
Tell the truth.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.759
Tell the truth
and set your mind free.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.595
Okay, I was jealous.
Jealous of who?

17:08.628 --> 17:09.028
You.
Me?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.397
Yeah.
Why?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.232
Because I didn't want
people to think that you
were better than me.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.066
Better than you?
Yeah.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.167
I'm a felon.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.169
I have a parole officer.
I can't vote.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.771
I have a tattoo
on my back

17:18.805 --> 17:20.240
made with a safety pin.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.741
And it says "Larry."

17:21.774 --> 17:24.111
And it's misspelled,
L-A-R-Y-R.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.112
And Larry did it.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.379
Oh.
Rochelle, I'm not

17:26.413 --> 17:28.381
better than you,
I want to be just like you.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.083
How many times I
gotta tell you that?

17:30.117 --> 17:30.917
The only thing

17:30.950 --> 17:34.121
I got going for me
is these computers.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.089
And last week,
I was this close

17:36.123 --> 17:37.023
to stealing each
and every one of them.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.693
Every day is a struggle,
Rochelle, every day.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.329
But I keep going and I
keep going,

17:42.362 --> 17:45.732
because someday I hope I can be
half as good as you are.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.202
You are.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.370
I am what?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.239
Half as good as me.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.174
Thank you.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.178
:
Sorry.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.279
What

17:59.312 --> 18:01.248
What? I didn't
hear that one.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.384
:
I'm sorry.
No, you know what?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.119
You really, you're mumbling
and you really need to turn

18:06.153 --> 18:07.854
the volume up like this:
what, what?!

18:07.887 --> 18:09.289
Okay, I said
I was sorry.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.558
Sorry!
Sorry! Sorry!

18:11.591 --> 18:12.725
Thank you.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.793
Now, sit down.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.629
Two weeks later,
Malvo stole all the computers

18:16.663 --> 18:19.532
and used the money to have
her tattoo removed.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.301
Back at home,
my father was doing

18:21.334 --> 18:22.635
some computing of his own.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.237
* ...from head to toe.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.305
Catchy little tune, isn't it?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.274
Huh?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.509
You went to Andrea's house,
didn't you?

18:29.542 --> 18:30.510
Don't lie.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.911
I'm sorry, Daddy.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.280
No, she's not.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.681
Tonya, come here.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.885
Tonya, I know
you're growing up,

18:38.918 --> 18:40.620
and you can't be
my little girl forever.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.255
So throw her out the house.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.524
But you've got junior high
and high school in front of you.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.293
And a foot coming up
fast behind you.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.329
That's the time when most kids
make bad decisions.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.298
I'm here to help you
make good ones.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.632
By choking some sense into you.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.866
You understand?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.568
I understand, Daddy.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.840
For me?!
Yup.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.175
Thank you!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.847
You did something
I didn't like,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.616
now I'm doing something
you don't like.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.319
You're lucky he didn't
make you pay $12.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.887
Man, that was
such a close call.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.690
It's a good thing I
was able to get in there
and switch those lasagnas.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.293
What? I switched
the lasagna.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.562
When?
Right before
I left the room.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.297
What did you do?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.333
Chris, come on!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.834
You might be black,
but you're not fireproof!

19:27.867 --> 19:29.502
Leave that bag there.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.790
Wait a minute--
so that means that

19:50.823 --> 19:52.892
I gave the lasagna with
no weed in it to T.J.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.327
That would be correct.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.595
So if that went to T.J...

19:55.628 --> 19:57.297
Who's got the lasagna
with the weed in it?

20:00.733 --> 20:06.639
* The tide is high,
but I'm holding on... *

20:06.673 --> 20:09.576
Feed me some more lasagna.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.977
Mmm...

20:12.379 --> 20:14.281
* I'm not the kind of girl

20:14.314 --> 20:16.283
* Who gives up just

20:16.316 --> 20:18.285
* Like that...

20:18.318 --> 20:20.287
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.490
