WEBVTT

00:00.163 --> 00:02.297
<i>This was your beat?</i>

00:03.278 --> 00:05.045
Yeah. Italian border,

00:05.080 --> 00:07.114
from here all the way
up to Switzerland.

00:07.149 --> 00:08.482
It's a hell of
a lot more picturesque

00:08.533 --> 00:09.900
than where I worked.

00:09.934 --> 00:12.770
Well, the longer
you police an area,

00:12.804 --> 00:13.804
the harder it is

00:13.839 --> 00:15.005
to appreciate picturesque.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.825
Lot of human-trafficking
through here?

00:17.876 --> 00:18.926
More all the time.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.277
I was working on
a joint operation,

00:20.312 --> 00:22.146
with some of
the other border regions.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.814
I'd like to see
that investigation

00:23.849 --> 00:26.333
if you still have access.

00:26.368 --> 00:28.419
That's why
you asked me to bring you

00:28.453 --> 00:30.037
to my old stomping grounds?

00:30.088 --> 00:31.755
It's related
to Phillip Genovese,

00:31.790 --> 00:33.874
the files you had me gather?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.993
It may have something
to do with Genovese.

00:36.011 --> 00:37.294
I don't know.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.379
But I really do want to
familiarize myself

00:38.430 --> 00:39.947
with the area.

00:39.981 --> 00:42.900
I guess I could
introduce you to Captain Geroux,

00:42.934 --> 00:45.335
my former superior.

00:45.353 --> 00:48.171
And I wouldn't mind checking up
on the progress myself.

00:48.190 --> 00:50.173
Great.

00:51.309 --> 00:52.893
You mean now, don't you?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.338 --> 01:23.841
You said you'd take me
dancing before the party.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.259
Yeah...

01:25.310 --> 01:27.244
But we need to send
the bodyguards first.

01:27.279 --> 01:30.210
Then send them.
You promised me!

01:31.883 --> 01:33.334
Okay, okay.

01:45.914 --> 01:46.947
This is Jacques.

01:46.998 --> 01:48.916
Jacques, we're going to a club.

01:48.950 --> 01:49.917
The, um...?

01:49.951 --> 01:50.951
Mecca.

01:51.002 --> 01:52.336
The Mecca. In town.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.371
<i>Don't forget</i>
<i>the party after!</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:57.574
I gave them the address
when I got here.

01:57.592 --> 01:59.409
And then a private party.

01:59.427 --> 02:01.128
<i>You have the address.</i>

02:01.179 --> 02:02.913
I'll send the advance team now.

02:04.182 --> 02:05.916
Give us half an hour.

02:07.352 --> 02:08.469
Half an hour.

02:11.222 --> 02:14.275
Whatever will we do?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.151
- Ca va?
- Ca va.

02:41.419 --> 02:43.587
Inspected first location now.

02:43.622 --> 02:47.508
It's dark, crowded
and impossible to control.

02:47.559 --> 02:48.559
Maxim's going to love it here.

02:48.593 --> 02:51.395
No comments, just do the job.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.953
Okay.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.340
Get him straight
to the V.I.P. area.

03:19.374 --> 03:21.342
It's a much safer environment.

03:21.376 --> 03:23.510
Check out the second venue.

03:23.545 --> 03:25.139
I'll get the package rolling.

03:34.639 --> 03:37.107
Head to
the private party venue.

04:07.722 --> 04:08.756
We can go to the club now.

04:10.608 --> 04:12.259
Party time.

04:18.065 --> 04:20.050
There's no one here.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.571
This is the address
she gave me.

04:24.606 --> 04:28.325
Okay, so where is the party?

04:31.296 --> 04:33.197
Jacques?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.582
I might have a bad address
on the party.

04:35.617 --> 04:38.001
Advance one?

04:38.036 --> 04:41.538
Advance one?
Can you hear me?

04:41.572 --> 04:43.590
Come in, advance one.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.592
Hello?

04:50.548 --> 04:52.415
Something's wrong?

04:52.434 --> 04:54.218
I lost their signal.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.269
Maybe they're having

04:55.303 --> 04:58.255
a little bit of fun for once.

05:10.068 --> 05:13.036
Go around the block
until the "Z" -list gets inside.

05:13.071 --> 05:14.604
Stuck, boss.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.158
Leave the car here.
Let's get inside.

05:36.678 --> 05:37.794
Where's Laure?

05:37.812 --> 05:39.313
She's behind us!

05:39.347 --> 05:41.464
Let's get upstairs.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.512
No!

07:07.839 --> 07:09.400
Saturday night,

07:09.520 --> 07:11.001
the joint must be jumpin'.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.920
Nah. They're at the scene
of a multiple homicide

07:12.971 --> 07:14.955
and kidnapping in Cannes.

07:16.307 --> 07:19.092
The joint really is jumpin'.

07:20.161 --> 07:22.196
Salut, Claude.
Ca va?

07:24.849 --> 07:27.351
Oui. Combien?

07:30.688 --> 07:31.822
Oui, peut-etre.

07:31.856 --> 07:34.324
On n'est pas loin. On arrive.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.776
This might actually be
a case for us.

07:36.811 --> 07:37.927
Why do you say that?

07:37.962 --> 07:40.763
It might match
another kidnapping in Florence

07:40.798 --> 07:42.065
a few months ago.

07:42.099 --> 07:43.800
It was in one of the files
Major Daniel had me process.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.301
You're sure?

07:45.335 --> 07:46.803
I told you.
I have a memory thing.

07:46.837 --> 07:49.839
Okay. Let's check it out
with Sebastian.

08:04.071 --> 08:06.355
Dammit!

08:18.335 --> 08:19.335
Anne-Marie?

08:19.369 --> 08:21.054
Yeah, Sebastian?
Sorry to disturb you

08:21.088 --> 08:22.705
<i>on a Saturday.</i>

08:22.723 --> 08:25.592
It's all right.
I'm still at the office.

08:25.643 --> 08:26.976
I had some work to catch up on.

08:27.011 --> 08:28.394
Some programming.

08:28.429 --> 08:30.313
What can I do for you?

08:30.347 --> 08:32.315
Can you access

08:32.349 --> 08:34.683
Florentine crime databases
over the last six months?

08:34.717 --> 08:36.686
Yeah. Hold on.

08:43.961 --> 08:45.528
What are you looking for?

08:45.562 --> 08:46.996
There's been a kidnapping
in Cannes.

08:47.031 --> 08:48.731
It sounds like one in Florence.

08:48.749 --> 08:50.700
Yes. There're... two,

08:50.734 --> 08:52.585
one parental abduction,

08:52.620 --> 08:54.888
<i>one kidnapping for ransom</i>
<i>from a public space</i>

08:54.922 --> 08:56.706
<i>where the victim's</i>
<i>security team</i>

08:56.740 --> 08:58.407
was overpowered and...

08:58.425 --> 09:00.593
<i>And murdered.</i>
<i>Very similar.</i>

09:00.628 --> 09:02.629
Yes. Very.

09:02.680 --> 09:03.746
Uh, no,
I was talking to Hickman.

09:03.764 --> 09:05.548
You're with Hickman?

09:06.917 --> 09:08.584
Yeah. Uh, can you call
Major Daniel

09:08.602 --> 09:10.687
<i>and tell him</i>
<i>we're close to the scene?</i>

09:10.721 --> 09:11.938
We'll see what we can find out.

09:11.972 --> 09:13.806
If he doesn't think
the case is for us,

09:13.841 --> 09:15.091
then we can always pull back.

09:15.109 --> 09:18.094
- Right.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

09:20.531 --> 09:22.615
She's with Hickman...

09:22.650 --> 09:24.934
in Cannes?

09:29.073 --> 09:33.076
Dinner was lovely.
Thank you.

09:34.511 --> 09:35.828
I'm going to clean up.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.631
No, I can do it.

09:39.667 --> 09:42.135
Um... we can
do it together.

10:08.946 --> 10:10.780
No.

10:10.814 --> 10:13.616
It's all right.
It's all right.

10:13.650 --> 10:16.502
No.

10:16.537 --> 10:18.121
It's not all right.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.544
It'll never be all right.

10:48.152 --> 10:50.120
Sebastian.

10:50.154 --> 10:53.623
No. No, no. I was...

10:53.658 --> 10:55.041
What can I do for you?

11:10.007 --> 11:11.308
Excuse me.

11:15.646 --> 11:18.515
Sergeant Vittoria.

11:19.684 --> 11:21.685
Cheers, mate.

11:27.024 --> 11:27.724
There.

11:27.742 --> 11:29.576
Get that into you.

11:34.498 --> 11:38.285
Why does the Lord hate me?

11:41.206 --> 11:42.653
Detective Hickman?

11:48.745 --> 11:49.912
Captain Claude Geroux.

11:49.946 --> 11:51.213
Nice to meet you.

11:51.248 --> 11:53.132
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I've heard a lot about you.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.217
Excuse me.

12:00.757 --> 12:01.873
How was the reunion?

12:01.993 --> 12:03.523
They're overwhelmed.

12:03.643 --> 12:05.928
Anybody would be.
Can I see your phone?

12:13.770 --> 12:15.988
Get this photo of that casing
to Sebastian to analyze.

12:16.023 --> 12:18.190
Mm-hmm.

12:18.241 --> 12:19.442
They're all
double-tapped.

12:21.144 --> 12:22.445
One shot centre-mass,
one in the head.

12:22.479 --> 12:24.180
It's extremely brazen.

12:24.214 --> 12:26.032
The club was packed.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.450
They didn't worry about
witnesses describing them.

12:27.484 --> 12:31.003
Well, if something
is fast and brutal,

12:31.038 --> 12:32.821
nobody remembers any details.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.840
It's how the mob works
in New York.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.510
These kills
were definitely professional.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.219
One more pint and I was
home free

13:07.339 --> 13:08.551
with the most beautiful
bird I've seen

13:08.586 --> 13:10.136
since I left Dublin.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.387
I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

13:11.422 --> 13:13.473
There's a lot
you don't know about me.

13:13.507 --> 13:15.174
Really?

13:15.209 --> 13:17.226
Where were you
on a Saturday night?

13:17.261 --> 13:20.463
There's a lot you don't
know about me, either.

13:20.497 --> 13:21.731
In the gym.

13:21.765 --> 13:23.816
Dedication.
That's hot.

13:23.851 --> 13:26.386
7.62, lead ore.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.888
It's Russian,
but manufactured in Bulgaria.

13:28.906 --> 13:30.623
- Fairly rare.
<i>- Russian?</i>

13:31.232 --> 13:32.077
What's the case?

13:32.197 --> 13:33.557
<i>Kidnapping in Cannes.</i>

13:33.677 --> 13:35.234
The victim's called
Maxim Marianski.

13:35.354 --> 13:36.886
His father's
a Russian billionaire.

13:37.006 --> 13:39.865
Double-tap kills
are a military tactic.

13:39.899 --> 13:42.405
A lot of Russian
military went bad,

13:42.753 --> 13:43.803
and they don't like
the new rich.

13:43.837 --> 13:45.421
There could be
a connection there.

13:45.455 --> 13:46.822
Is that enough
to make it cross-border?

13:46.840 --> 13:49.008
To ask for the case?

13:49.042 --> 13:51.544
<i>The crime itself</i>
<i>is only within France...</i>

13:51.595 --> 13:52.511
<i>As far as we know.</i>

13:52.546 --> 13:55.664
But... we have
a similar Florence case.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.601
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

13:58.635 --> 14:01.988
Rich victim,
blitz attack on security,

14:02.022 --> 14:05.107
double-tap kills
with 7.62s...

14:05.142 --> 14:06.726
Sure looks like
the same team did both.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.477
<i>I'll call Dorn.</i>

14:08.512 --> 14:09.779
<i>Sebastian, get your equipment.</i>

14:09.813 --> 14:11.964
<i>We are all going</i>
<i>to the South of France.</i>

14:11.999 --> 14:16.802
<i>Pick me up in a chopper</i>
<i>at the heliport. Bye.</i>

14:16.837 --> 14:19.521
Wow... a man asking me
to the South of France

14:19.539 --> 14:20.539
on a Saturday night?

14:20.574 --> 14:23.159
You would think
that would sound sexier.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.244
Anne-Marie and Hickman
were already there...

14:26.580 --> 14:28.547
Together.

14:30.834 --> 14:31.918
Where is my son?

14:31.969 --> 14:34.026
I need to
speak to someone there!

14:34.146 --> 14:35.720
What's going on?

14:35.754 --> 14:38.189
- The victim's mother is here.
- I need to see my son!

14:38.224 --> 14:39.457
They let her
into the crime scene?

14:39.577 --> 14:40.628
You're gonna be in big trouble!

14:40.748 --> 14:43.311
In Cannes, no one refuses
Caroline Marianski anything.

14:43.431 --> 14:46.440
Hey! Please! Does anyone
know where my son is?

14:46.782 --> 14:47.966
Madame Marianski?

14:48.001 --> 14:49.284
Yes.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.752
- I'm Captain Geroux.
- Hi.

14:50.786 --> 14:53.055
Shall we find some privacy?

14:57.844 --> 15:00.095
Victim's father, Lev Marianski,

15:00.129 --> 15:02.129
is one of the richest men
in the world.

15:02.982 --> 15:04.599
He's just arrived.

15:04.633 --> 15:05.851
Where does his money come from?

15:05.902 --> 15:08.320
Well, initially, black market,
after the fall,

15:08.354 --> 15:10.856
but he went much more mainstream
in the last decade.

15:10.907 --> 15:13.658
He has tech companies,
financial companies,

15:13.693 --> 15:15.143
a string of high-end stores,

15:15.161 --> 15:17.079
even owns a football team
in Italy...

15:17.113 --> 15:20.248
A team that never covers
the point spread, by the way.

15:20.283 --> 15:22.317
<i>Soccer has a spread?</i>

15:22.335 --> 15:24.152
It's called "football."

15:24.170 --> 15:25.253
<i>Yeah, whatever it's called,</i>

15:25.288 --> 15:26.338
<i>how do you figure</i>
<i>a point spread in a game</i>

15:26.372 --> 15:28.090
where nobody ever
scores any points?

15:28.124 --> 15:31.009
Well, someone scores,
or I wouldn't have so ma...

15:32.211 --> 15:34.930
Anyway. We are 15 minutes out.

15:34.964 --> 15:36.181
Madame Marianski...

15:36.215 --> 15:37.215
It's Pelletier.

15:38.051 --> 15:39.667
We divorced three years ago,

15:39.685 --> 15:43.055
and I took back my maiden name
the moment I legally could.

15:43.106 --> 15:45.891
Who are you people again?

15:45.942 --> 15:46.808
We work out of

15:46.842 --> 15:48.610
the International
Criminal Court.

15:48.644 --> 15:51.012
Handling kidnappings?

15:51.030 --> 15:52.197
Well, handling
cross-border crimes.

15:52.231 --> 15:53.982
I don't understand.

15:54.016 --> 15:55.367
They took him across a border?

15:55.401 --> 15:57.018
No, madame.

15:57.036 --> 15:59.354
There was a similar kidnapping
in Florence,

15:59.372 --> 16:00.889
several months ago.

16:00.923 --> 16:02.307
So this is
a professional group?

16:02.341 --> 16:03.325
The kidnappers?

16:03.359 --> 16:04.626
It appears so.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.211
All kidnappings are
professional, aren't they?

16:06.245 --> 16:08.880
Unless the parents do it.

16:08.915 --> 16:10.215
Look.

16:10.249 --> 16:13.668
If you want to investigate me,
investigate me.

16:13.702 --> 16:16.171
Until then, what are you
doing to find my son?

16:16.205 --> 16:18.056
Sir, look around you.

16:18.091 --> 16:20.675
Almost every officer
in the region is here.

16:20.709 --> 16:21.876
Standing around, doing nothing.

16:21.894 --> 16:23.161
In a ransom kidnapping,

16:23.196 --> 16:25.230
you generally need to wait
for further contact.

16:25.264 --> 16:27.215
How long will that take?

16:28.384 --> 16:30.268
You have somewhere
more important to be?

16:32.054 --> 16:34.406
You've checked your watch twice
since you got here.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.024
No. I have nowhere to be.

16:36.058 --> 16:37.175
How much time
do you have before

16:37.210 --> 16:38.860
you need to report this
to the insurance company?

16:38.894 --> 16:39.995
Insurance?

16:40.029 --> 16:42.230
Mr. Marianski,
you must insure your valuables?

16:42.248 --> 16:44.199
Did you buy an insurance
on Maxim?

16:44.233 --> 16:45.667
Caroline...

16:45.701 --> 16:47.085
Usually, a man
in your ex-husband's position

16:47.120 --> 16:50.122
takes out an insurance policy,
a kidnap policy, on his family.

16:50.173 --> 16:52.207
He probably has one
on you as well.

16:52.241 --> 16:53.915
Is that true?

16:55.911 --> 16:57.242
As you say, it was prudent.

16:57.362 --> 16:58.624
But we're not
married any longer.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.748
You can buy
insurance on anyone.

17:02.751 --> 17:03.752
You cold bastard.

17:04.954 --> 17:07.055
Actually, madame,
kidnap insurance

17:07.089 --> 17:08.423
provides certainty

17:08.441 --> 17:11.193
that, if something like this
should happen,

17:11.227 --> 17:12.810
the ransom money would be
readily available.

17:12.845 --> 17:15.730
It also tends to
keep negotiations to a minimum.

17:15.763 --> 17:17.098
Makes it more of
a business transaction.

17:17.116 --> 17:20.268
You probably have a million
reasons to hate your ex-husband,

17:20.286 --> 17:22.704
but this shouldn't be
one of 'em.

17:22.738 --> 17:24.406
May I have a moment
with you, please?

17:33.249 --> 17:34.332
"Millions of reasons"
to hate me?

17:34.383 --> 17:36.718
Three years after a divorce,

17:36.752 --> 17:37.785
a rich ex-wife should have

17:37.803 --> 17:39.387
a string of young guys
helping her forget,

17:39.422 --> 17:41.306
but she's still
really pissed at you.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.724
That kind of anger is earned.

17:42.758 --> 17:45.160
Right now, I'm more
concerned about the chip.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.112
Chip?

17:47.146 --> 17:49.297
Your son has a tracer chip
in him, right?

17:49.315 --> 17:50.765
I wouldn't...

17:50.799 --> 17:51.799
Things are gonna go

17:51.817 --> 17:53.935
so much easier
if you don't lie to me.

18:00.409 --> 18:01.743
You're wearing a $23,000 watch.

18:01.777 --> 18:04.412
So?

18:04.447 --> 18:06.748
It's a fake.
The sub-dial is all wrong.

18:06.782 --> 18:08.516
The inner wall should
be gold, not white.

18:08.551 --> 18:10.085
It's too thick by half.

18:10.119 --> 18:11.503
But it's a good fake,
it's a professional fake,

18:11.537 --> 18:13.071
and they don't
come cheap either,

18:13.105 --> 18:14.322
which suggests

18:14.340 --> 18:17.876
that you...
You like to look good,

18:17.927 --> 18:19.227
but you're not above
saving a buck.

18:19.262 --> 18:21.429
Kidnap insurance
gives a discount

18:21.464 --> 18:23.498
when the insured
has a locator chip,

18:23.516 --> 18:25.467
and I'm guessing that
you went for that option.

18:27.303 --> 18:28.270
She can't know.

18:28.304 --> 18:30.472
Oh, she most definitely
will know,

18:30.506 --> 18:31.973
but our problem right now

18:32.007 --> 18:33.892
is what the chip-makers
don't tell you.

18:33.943 --> 18:35.860
Hey! Hurry up, I said!

18:35.895 --> 18:37.178
Jacket! Now!

18:37.196 --> 18:38.846
<i>These are probably</i>
<i>professional kidnappers.</i>

18:38.864 --> 18:41.182
<i>Knowing the level</i>
<i>of Maxim's security,</i>

18:41.200 --> 18:42.350
<i>they'll expect a chip, too.</i>

18:42.368 --> 18:43.485
<i>They'll get rid of</i>

18:43.519 --> 18:45.487
<i>every shred of clothing,</i>
<i>down to his skin.</i>

18:45.521 --> 18:47.355
<i>Then glasses, jewellery,</i>
<i>piercings, prosthetics...</i>

18:47.373 --> 18:50.992
<i>Anything removable</i>
<i>that could hide a device.</i>

18:51.026 --> 18:53.128
<i>Finally, when</i>
<i>he's completely stripped,</i>

18:53.162 --> 18:55.330
<i>they'll scan him</i>
<i>to check for any electronics.</i>

18:55.364 --> 18:57.382
<i>And they're going to find it.</i>

18:57.416 --> 18:58.583
<i>Question is...</i>

18:58.618 --> 19:00.552
Is the tracking device
something that he carries,

19:00.586 --> 19:02.254
or did you have it
implanted inside him?

19:09.169 --> 19:10.819
You put a tracking
device inside him?

19:10.853 --> 19:12.887
For his own protection.

19:12.905 --> 19:13.822
When did you do this?

19:13.856 --> 19:15.407
When he visited me in Minsk.

19:15.441 --> 19:17.359
A Russian doctor
cut open our son?

19:17.393 --> 19:20.912
It was probably
more like an injection.

19:20.946 --> 19:21.946
What kind of monster does that?

19:21.998 --> 19:23.415
I'm a monster
for wanting him safe?

19:23.449 --> 19:25.867
They only thing you wanted
is to save money!

19:25.901 --> 19:27.252
You mean like hiring

19:27.286 --> 19:30.255
those useless
French security men?

19:30.289 --> 19:31.840
Better than
the gorillas you use.

19:31.874 --> 19:33.708
I can see how much
better your people are.

19:33.742 --> 19:34.542
All right, while
watching you two

19:34.576 --> 19:35.710
has been thoroughly enjoyable,

19:35.744 --> 19:37.846
why don't we start
focusing on your son?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.098
What will they do if they
find it, the tracking device?

19:40.132 --> 19:42.750
I don't know.
It's hard to tell at this point.

19:42.768 --> 19:45.387
- Well, tell me the truth!
- The truth about what?

19:48.474 --> 19:50.141
We have four dead
on the first floor.

19:50.192 --> 19:51.142
Do you mind checking it out?

19:51.177 --> 19:52.143
Yeah, sure.

19:52.194 --> 19:53.695
The victim
has a tracer implant.

19:53.729 --> 19:55.897
- Do we know the tag I.D.?
- I have it.

19:58.067 --> 20:01.152
Just give me
a second to set up.

20:04.323 --> 20:06.791
These wankers are efficient.

20:08.494 --> 20:12.113
Four dead, eight shots.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.114
Clean...

20:13.149 --> 20:14.215
Cold.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.283
Bodyguard.

20:16.218 --> 20:17.252
Bouncer.

20:18.287 --> 20:19.454
Bodyguard.

20:20.956 --> 20:22.841
Who's the girl?

20:24.143 --> 20:26.845
She looks like a civilian.

20:26.896 --> 20:30.815
Maybe she was with the target.

20:33.352 --> 20:34.402
Why did you kill her?

20:34.437 --> 20:37.272
Shut up.

20:44.997 --> 20:45.813
Do we know who that girl was,

20:45.831 --> 20:46.948
the one they shot?

20:46.982 --> 20:47.949
She was called Laure.

20:47.983 --> 20:49.834
Maxim's girlfriend.

20:49.869 --> 20:51.920
How long had
they been together?

20:51.954 --> 20:52.987
Six months.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.289
She was a gold-digger
from the <i>Banlieue.</i>

20:54.323 --> 20:55.623
How do you know that?

20:55.657 --> 20:58.042
She hates all his girlfriends,
since he was 10 years old.

20:58.094 --> 21:02.263
Why else would a 28-year-old
be dating a teenager?

21:02.298 --> 21:04.215
He'll be 20 next week
and he's in love with her.

21:04.266 --> 21:06.301
Oh, stop.
At that age,

21:06.335 --> 21:08.136
boys are in love
with every girl.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.438
I have it...
The tracking device.

21:10.473 --> 21:11.272
Is it moving?

21:11.307 --> 21:13.508
Doesn't seem to be.

21:13.526 --> 21:14.442
Can you get a location?

21:14.477 --> 21:16.227
Yep. It's at...

21:16.278 --> 21:19.447
Avenue Beauregard in Cannes.

21:19.482 --> 21:20.281
Are you sure?

21:20.316 --> 21:21.816
What does that mean to you?

21:21.850 --> 21:23.518
It's our...

21:23.536 --> 21:25.954
Her address.

21:25.988 --> 21:27.288
The family villa.

21:27.323 --> 21:28.957
He's at home?

21:40.503 --> 21:41.836
Don't touch that.

21:41.870 --> 21:43.538
Please.

21:53.315 --> 21:54.182
"We will
contact you soon."

21:55.234 --> 21:56.401
What is that?

21:58.237 --> 22:00.188
It's a microch.

22:09.949 --> 22:12.200
Is there any indication
of time on the note?

22:12.234 --> 22:14.068
Only "soon."

22:14.086 --> 22:15.837
Where was the device
implanted in him?

22:15.871 --> 22:17.071
Back of the hand.

22:17.089 --> 22:19.290
Probably not a critical injury.

22:19.341 --> 22:20.542
Hand ain't no picnic.

22:20.576 --> 22:22.594
- Well... oh, I didn't mean...
- I'm just busting balls.

22:25.047 --> 22:25.913
Messing around.

22:25.931 --> 22:28.850
So, Sebastian,
set up in the house

22:28.884 --> 22:30.468
to trap and trace
any ransom call.

22:30.519 --> 22:32.420
I'll also capture
the data lines,

22:32.438 --> 22:33.421
in case
they reach out digitally.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.606
Good.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.424
Poke around
the family financial records.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.310
We may need them.

22:39.361 --> 22:40.595
Wouldn't that be illegal?

22:40.613 --> 22:43.198
We're not trying to
prosecute him for anything.

22:43.232 --> 22:44.566
Not yet.

22:45.618 --> 22:47.151
What do you need from me?

22:47.203 --> 22:48.887
There was an advance guard,

22:48.921 --> 22:49.921
who was not present

22:49.955 --> 22:51.139
when the kidnapping took place.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.575
Maybe it was an inside job.

22:53.609 --> 22:54.375
Right.

22:56.629 --> 22:58.246
Eva, I need you in Florence.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.115
Maybe there's something
from the other kidnapping

23:01.133 --> 23:01.966
that can help us here.

23:02.001 --> 23:04.118
Okay.

23:04.136 --> 23:06.337
Anne-Marie...

23:06.388 --> 23:08.223
This is our base of operations.

23:08.257 --> 23:09.557
Liaise with the parents.

23:09.592 --> 23:10.558
Excuse me, sir?

23:10.593 --> 23:13.428
Explain that, now,
it's a waiting game.

23:13.462 --> 23:16.431
We wait for the kidnappers
to contact us,

23:16.465 --> 23:18.132
then get
the insurance company involved.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.484
Yeah. Uh...

23:19.518 --> 23:21.269
Sir, I'm really sorry, but...

23:21.303 --> 23:23.304
almost anyone else
is better-suited than me...

23:23.322 --> 23:24.989
- ...to take care of...
- You can do it.

23:26.025 --> 23:26.991
You can.

23:30.696 --> 23:33.031
No, I'm not
listening to you anymore!

23:33.065 --> 23:35.033
This is all your fault.

23:35.084 --> 23:36.251
How is it my fault?

23:36.285 --> 23:38.286
If you spent more time
thinking of him...

23:38.320 --> 23:40.922
That is one seriously
dysfunctional divorce.

23:40.956 --> 23:42.674
Please, Carl...

23:42.708 --> 23:45.343
Their child is in danger.

24:20.212 --> 24:21.963
Step, step, step.

24:21.997 --> 24:23.381
Get down.

25:36.581 --> 25:38.299
Madame Pelletier?

25:38.333 --> 25:39.950
Is there news?

25:39.985 --> 25:41.418
No, no, no. Um...

25:41.469 --> 25:43.504
I...

25:43.538 --> 25:44.705
I'm very sorry

25:44.739 --> 25:47.007
that this is happening
to you, madame.

25:49.327 --> 25:51.044
Would you care for some tea?

25:51.062 --> 25:53.631
I... I can do that!

25:53.665 --> 25:54.682
I'll do that.

26:00.739 --> 26:02.823
Now... let's see
what you've been up to,

26:02.858 --> 26:04.909
Mr. Marianski.

26:28.466 --> 26:30.751
I can have a mate
who can enhance all this, so...

26:30.769 --> 26:32.753
Maybe he'll get
something out of it.

26:32.787 --> 26:34.521
I'll copy it for you.

26:36.341 --> 26:37.398
You're...

26:37.518 --> 26:40.027
All from the International
Criminal Court?

26:40.061 --> 26:41.979
Yeah. Sort of.

26:42.379 --> 26:46.033
We, uh, specialize
in cross-border crime.

26:46.067 --> 26:48.569
These kidnappers may have
done another one in Florence.

26:48.603 --> 26:51.405
Professional kidnappers don't
usually kill anyone, do they?

26:51.439 --> 26:53.524
Not unless they have to.

26:53.558 --> 26:55.409
It's bad for business.

26:55.443 --> 26:57.444
So how long have you

26:57.462 --> 26:59.780
worked for the family?

26:59.814 --> 27:01.665
Six months.

27:01.716 --> 27:03.593
We don't work for the family,
by the way.

27:03.713 --> 27:05.219
No?

27:05.287 --> 27:07.238
Madame Pelletier is the client.

27:07.289 --> 27:10.124
The father doesn't trust us.

27:10.159 --> 27:11.525
What about Maxim?

27:11.543 --> 27:14.195
Maxim...

27:14.229 --> 27:15.330
He's a security nightmare.

27:15.364 --> 27:17.932
Always taking off,

27:17.966 --> 27:20.501
trying to shake off
his bodyguards.

27:20.535 --> 27:22.536
These kidnappers...

27:22.554 --> 27:24.339
They didn't wait
till he was alone.

27:24.373 --> 27:26.474
Yeah.

27:26.508 --> 27:27.475
Probably because

27:27.509 --> 27:29.510
of Laure.

27:29.545 --> 27:32.063
The girlfriend.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.182
He was very protective of her.

27:37.136 --> 27:38.870
Is there something
you want to say about her?

27:38.904 --> 27:40.938
She was the one
who wanted to go.

27:40.989 --> 27:42.373
To the club?

27:42.408 --> 27:43.975
And to the party.

27:45.861 --> 27:47.328
The non-existent
party.

27:47.363 --> 27:48.596
Yeah.

27:48.630 --> 27:52.083
That's why Jacques only had
one guard with him.

27:54.569 --> 27:57.538
I'm sorry about your boss.

27:57.573 --> 28:00.258
He was a good man.

28:02.361 --> 28:04.178
Good bodyguard.

28:08.050 --> 28:09.250
Have you ever lost a partner?

28:11.586 --> 28:13.471
Uh, yeah.

28:13.522 --> 28:15.223
And...

28:15.257 --> 28:17.358
how do you handle the guilt?

28:20.362 --> 28:23.064
I figure that out,
I'll let you know.

28:34.643 --> 28:37.729
We'll make the video,
then I'll call Katya.

28:40.716 --> 28:42.067
Hey, hey.

28:42.101 --> 28:44.552
That can wait
'til after the video.

28:44.570 --> 28:46.021
He must be starving.

28:46.055 --> 28:46.821
So?

28:50.442 --> 28:52.226
We can do the video
after he eats.

28:52.244 --> 28:55.246
What? Are you soft for him?

28:55.280 --> 28:56.564
Don't be stupid.

28:56.582 --> 28:57.999
Then what's troubling you?

28:58.033 --> 29:00.734
This. The whole thing.

29:00.752 --> 29:02.620
I don't...

29:04.673 --> 29:05.373
It feels wrong.

29:06.792 --> 29:09.076
Hey.

29:10.245 --> 29:11.712
This is our biggest one.

29:11.747 --> 29:14.432
Huh? Ever.

29:14.466 --> 29:17.051
After that, we'll stop, huh?

29:17.085 --> 29:20.421
Like we always wanted.

29:26.361 --> 29:27.478
Put your mask back on.

29:27.529 --> 29:29.530
I'm not an idiot, Yan.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.121
Here, some food.

29:37.155 --> 29:38.456
I don't want any.

29:38.490 --> 29:39.740
You have to eat.

29:39.775 --> 29:42.493
After we make the ransom video,
your father will pay,

29:42.544 --> 29:44.078
then you can go home.

29:44.112 --> 29:47.698
He isn't going to
pay anything for me.

29:47.733 --> 29:48.616
He will.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.301
Then you can go home.

29:50.335 --> 29:52.753
Home to what?

30:10.272 --> 30:12.073
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:20.866 --> 30:22.083
Eva?

30:22.117 --> 30:25.403
I'm trying to link Maxim
with the Florence victim.

30:25.437 --> 30:28.606
<i>They are both teenagers</i>
<i>with very rich parents,</i>

30:28.640 --> 30:31.842
<i>but different cities,</i>
<i>different nationalities,</i>

30:31.877 --> 30:33.544
<i>and with different profiles.</i>

30:33.578 --> 30:34.812
<i>So, Allesandro,</i>
<i>the boy in Florence,</i>

30:34.846 --> 30:37.665
he appears to be
a motivated art student

30:37.683 --> 30:39.767
at the Centro di Restauro,

30:39.801 --> 30:41.102
<i>but Maxim...</i>

30:41.136 --> 30:42.386
Is your typical
trust-fund waster.

30:42.437 --> 30:44.171
"Waster?"

30:44.189 --> 30:45.389
You sound like Tommy.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.641
I guess I'm not any happier

30:46.675 --> 30:48.643
with people
who have too much money.

30:48.677 --> 30:50.695
<i>How much is too much?</i>

30:50.729 --> 30:52.396
Eva...

30:52.447 --> 30:56.150
Do the guys know each other?

30:56.184 --> 30:57.818
Okay. Um... no.

30:57.852 --> 31:00.204
There's no evidence
they've ever met.

31:00.238 --> 31:01.572
All right, how can I help?

31:01.623 --> 31:04.191
Well, part of the Florence file
is available,

31:04.209 --> 31:05.209
but the other part is locked,

31:05.243 --> 31:07.328
<i>so I don't know how to get in.</i>

31:07.362 --> 31:09.280
I think I can get into it
by the time you get to Florence.

31:09.314 --> 31:12.633
Okay. Well, I think
I'll be there in about...

31:12.668 --> 31:13.701
42 minutes.

31:13.719 --> 31:15.302
I've got your progress
on my screen.

31:15.337 --> 31:17.154
Okay, then. Thanks. <i>Grazie.</i>

31:17.189 --> 31:18.255
<i>Ciao, ciao.</i>

31:18.306 --> 31:19.640
Okay.

31:19.675 --> 31:21.258
How much are you into them for?

31:32.187 --> 31:33.554
I had a partner who gambled.

31:33.572 --> 31:35.389
The only time
he talked about it

31:35.407 --> 31:36.607
was when he was winning big

31:36.658 --> 31:40.277
or losing big.

31:40.328 --> 31:41.696
And...

31:41.730 --> 31:43.197
no offense, but...

31:43.231 --> 31:44.782
you don't seem like a guy
on a winning streak.

31:47.569 --> 31:48.703
Why is "no offense"

31:48.737 --> 31:51.205
always followed by
something entirely offensive?

31:53.942 --> 31:55.593
I am not into anybody
for anything.

32:00.682 --> 32:01.882
All right...

33:01.443 --> 33:02.443
Hello, Dorn.

33:02.477 --> 33:04.278
What are you doing, Louis?

33:04.312 --> 33:06.614
I am on a case.

33:06.648 --> 33:07.832
Did you think I wouldn't know?

33:07.866 --> 33:10.918
Know? What do you mean, know?
Know what?

33:10.952 --> 33:13.003
I have alerts everywhere.

33:13.038 --> 33:15.005
What are you
talking about, Dorn?

33:15.040 --> 33:17.875
The Russian, Louis!

33:17.926 --> 33:21.445
You said I could handle it
without interference.

33:22.731 --> 33:23.647
I have.

33:23.698 --> 33:26.400
You're running checks
on my source.

33:26.434 --> 33:28.319
<i>No.</i>

33:28.370 --> 33:29.403
Yes, you are.

33:29.437 --> 33:33.491
I just told you...
I have alerts in the files.

33:33.542 --> 33:36.777
Someone is going through
the financial records

33:36.795 --> 33:38.913
<i>of the man</i>
<i>who gave me Dimitrov.</i>

33:38.947 --> 33:40.581
<i>Someone with</i>

33:40.615 --> 33:44.335
I.C.C. authorization
is trailing him.

33:44.386 --> 33:46.554
<i>Are you going to</i>
<i>try to tell me that</i>

33:46.588 --> 33:50.958
it isn't you or...
your German computer whiz?

33:52.477 --> 33:54.428
Your source, what's his name?

33:54.462 --> 33:56.680
What do you mean?

33:56.731 --> 33:58.682
"What is his name?"

33:58.733 --> 34:00.518
Marianski?

34:00.552 --> 34:02.386
It's Lev Marianski?

34:02.420 --> 34:04.638
Why do you ask me?

34:05.319 --> 34:09.560
Because I'm standing
in his son's room.

34:14.514 --> 34:17.668
The kidnapping case...

34:17.702 --> 34:19.987
it is Marianski's son?

34:20.021 --> 34:22.956
Yeah. And we think
the kidnappers are Russian,

34:22.991 --> 34:25.876
and they used military tactics.

34:25.911 --> 34:30.414
It is of utmost importance that
you keep me informed, Louis.

34:30.447 --> 34:33.583
I must know
if Dimitrov is involved.

34:33.635 --> 34:36.737
<i>If I were to go to Russia,</i>

34:36.771 --> 34:39.723
I would never make it back.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.440
<i>Max...</i>

35:09.904 --> 35:11.372
Time to make a movie!

35:11.406 --> 35:13.073
- Why?
- I told you.

35:13.091 --> 35:14.908
For the ransom,
so you can go home.

35:17.745 --> 35:18.879
Why did you kill her?

35:18.913 --> 35:21.465
You did that.
You killed Laure.

35:22.517 --> 35:23.467
It's okay, he didn't hurt me.

35:23.518 --> 35:25.102
You stay out of this.

35:27.939 --> 35:29.056
You touch her again...

35:29.090 --> 35:31.925
And we won't be needing
a video. Understand?

35:33.979 --> 35:35.595
You think I'm afraid of you?

35:35.614 --> 35:37.114
I told her...

35:37.148 --> 35:40.034
My father isn't going to pay
to get me back.

35:40.068 --> 35:41.535
He hates me.

35:41.569 --> 35:43.603
Just say what
I tell you to say.

35:45.123 --> 35:46.123
No.

35:51.746 --> 35:53.414
Then I'll kill your mother.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.481
After the divorce,

36:01.601 --> 36:03.405
we used to sit here,

36:03.423 --> 36:05.791
having tea together
in the morning,

36:05.842 --> 36:07.343
Maxim and me.

36:07.377 --> 36:08.677
That must've been nice.

36:08.712 --> 36:09.845
Nice?

36:09.880 --> 36:13.549
Do you know what they talked
about the entire time?

36:13.583 --> 36:15.351
While they were having their...

36:15.385 --> 36:16.435
Their "nice" tea?

36:16.470 --> 36:18.053
About me.

36:18.087 --> 36:19.388
Don't flatter yourself.

36:19.422 --> 36:20.973
Tell her all the things

36:21.024 --> 36:23.642
you told a teenage boy...
<i>a teenage boy...</i>

36:23.693 --> 36:24.944
About his father.

36:24.978 --> 36:26.479
I really don't need to know.

36:26.530 --> 36:27.363
She told him...

36:27.397 --> 36:28.531
I slept around,

36:28.565 --> 36:30.566
that I brought diseases home,

36:30.600 --> 36:32.651
that I fathered other children,

36:32.702 --> 36:34.436
that I never cared about them.

36:34.454 --> 36:35.821
What part of that is not true?

36:35.872 --> 36:37.573
A boy needs to
look up to his father.

36:37.607 --> 36:39.792
You poisoned him about me.

36:39.826 --> 36:41.477
To make your...
yourself feel better,

36:41.511 --> 36:42.962
to control him.

36:42.996 --> 36:43.996
Like you control him
with money?

36:44.047 --> 36:45.748
While you let him
squander all yours.

36:45.782 --> 36:47.016
Because you cut off
his support.

36:47.050 --> 36:50.118
I only had to support him
until he was 18 or in school.

36:50.136 --> 36:51.787
He's neither.

36:51.805 --> 36:53.055
Such a cheap bastard!

36:53.089 --> 36:54.122
He does nothing!

36:54.140 --> 36:56.392
Won't work!
Won't study!

36:56.426 --> 36:57.309
My cutting him off

36:57.344 --> 37:00.062
will finally make him
act like a man.

37:00.096 --> 37:00.980
That's enough!

37:01.014 --> 37:02.932
What are you doing?

37:04.434 --> 37:05.634
This is a game?

37:06.903 --> 37:11.140
You know, a lot of people
would love to have a child,

37:11.174 --> 37:14.142
and all you do is...

37:14.160 --> 37:16.395
Use him to hurt each other?

37:16.429 --> 37:17.863
No, we don't.

37:22.118 --> 37:22.985
We are under stress.

37:23.003 --> 37:24.587
Okay. Yeah.

37:24.621 --> 37:26.422
"Stress."

37:26.456 --> 37:27.540
Anne-Marie?

37:27.591 --> 37:29.458
We're meeting on the terrace.

37:36.633 --> 37:38.017
I suggest

37:38.051 --> 37:40.769
you find somewhere to sit...

37:40.804 --> 37:42.438
and think.

37:42.472 --> 37:44.089
Separately.

37:45.725 --> 37:47.893
Okay?

38:06.963 --> 38:07.997
Hello?

38:08.031 --> 38:09.698
You didn't tell the Italians

38:09.716 --> 38:10.699
about me going into
their files, did you?

38:10.717 --> 38:12.001
Excuse me?

38:12.035 --> 38:13.953
Well, I remember you saying
you were going to tell them

38:13.987 --> 38:15.220
to run a check-up
on their systems.

38:15.255 --> 38:18.474
Yeah. I...
I remember that.

38:18.508 --> 38:19.708
I was just kidding.

38:19.743 --> 38:22.044
Yeah, I tried to access
a Trojan Horse I installed,

38:22.062 --> 38:24.513
<i>but it seems closed.</i>

38:24.547 --> 38:25.931
Well, I wouldn't tell them,
okay?

38:25.982 --> 38:26.932
Well...

38:26.983 --> 38:28.484
whatever it is in that file,

38:28.518 --> 38:30.653
Florence really wants it secret.

38:32.238 --> 38:33.489
I have the address
of a witness,

38:33.523 --> 38:36.525
so I might just ask
how it all got solved.

38:36.559 --> 38:38.110
All right.
I'll be here if you need me.

38:38.161 --> 38:40.228
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

38:40.246 --> 38:41.864
Ciao.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.918
Dammit.

38:47.003 --> 38:48.621
Something wrong, mate?

38:48.672 --> 38:50.005
No. Nothing.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.540
Yeah, well,
Louis has called us together.

38:53.126 --> 38:55.127
Coming.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.246
<i>Uploading the video...</i>

38:58.264 --> 39:01.050
Now.

39:06.589 --> 39:08.173
I have the file.

39:08.208 --> 39:09.975
<i>This is the message...</i>

39:10.026 --> 39:14.163
<i>"10 million Euros in cash,</i>
<i>by 6:00 tonight.</i>

39:14.197 --> 39:15.948
<i>Delivery instructions</i>
<i>will follow."</i>

39:15.982 --> 39:17.700
I thought it was five million?

39:17.734 --> 39:19.034
The price has doubled.

39:19.069 --> 39:20.464
<i>Why?</i>

39:20.584 --> 39:22.871
Because I am in charge.

39:22.906 --> 39:24.873
What do you mean,
you're in charge?

39:24.908 --> 39:27.943
Just tell them, Katya!

39:27.961 --> 39:30.112
10 million.

39:33.616 --> 39:37.086
You think the girlfriend
set Maxim up for the kidnapping?

39:37.120 --> 39:38.153
She sent the advance team

39:38.188 --> 39:39.855
to a non-existent
party

39:39.889 --> 39:41.890
and she planned the trip
to the nightclub.

39:41.925 --> 39:44.076
Seems kind of
short-sighted of her.

39:44.110 --> 39:45.177
He's her boyfriend,

39:45.211 --> 39:47.296
and apparently,
he's worth millions.

39:47.330 --> 39:49.148
Well, his father
just cut his support.

39:49.182 --> 39:50.566
Really?

39:50.600 --> 39:51.717
So, what? Maxim was broke?

39:51.751 --> 39:53.602
Rich-kid "broke."

39:53.636 --> 39:54.903
He had a driver, a bodyguard
and a limo.

39:54.938 --> 39:56.989
Which were all
about to be taken away.

39:57.023 --> 39:59.024
Maybe he's in on it?

39:59.075 --> 40:01.944
I doubt he had a part
in killing the girlfriend.

40:01.978 --> 40:03.145
Security said
his whole lifestyle changed

40:03.163 --> 40:04.196
when he met her,

40:04.247 --> 40:06.331
became more... responsible.

40:06.366 --> 40:08.117
Maybe the kidnappers
killed Laure

40:08.151 --> 40:09.317
just because she was a witness?

40:09.335 --> 40:11.253
Not the first time.

40:11.287 --> 40:12.921
Okay, so, we dig into
the girlfriend's life

40:12.956 --> 40:16.324
and see if her contacts
give us a name.

40:16.342 --> 40:17.342
There's something
else about Marianski.

40:17.377 --> 40:18.343
What?

40:18.378 --> 40:20.796
He doesn't have
insurance on Maxim.

40:20.830 --> 40:22.865
Not anymore.

40:22.899 --> 40:24.983
And, for him,
he's short on cash.

40:25.018 --> 40:29.337
Most of his money is tied up
in investments and property,

40:29.355 --> 40:30.472
but he's only got

40:30.506 --> 40:31.306
a little more than 10 million
in liquid funds.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.275
He cancelled the policy?

40:33.309 --> 40:34.993
Yeah. About six months ago.

40:35.028 --> 40:36.061
What?

40:39.315 --> 40:41.683
You went into my records?

40:43.369 --> 40:45.287
Did you cancel the insurance?

40:45.321 --> 40:46.739
You were angry
I even bought it.

40:47.907 --> 40:50.375
That's our Skype call.

40:53.696 --> 40:56.031
It's coming in
on the family account.

40:56.049 --> 40:57.800
Mr. Marianski,
get in the chair.

40:59.969 --> 41:02.171
The important thing is to not

41:02.205 --> 41:03.922
let them think
that there's a problem.

41:03.973 --> 41:05.674
Just listen to the demand,

41:05.708 --> 41:06.725
and we'll figure it out later,
all right?

41:08.261 --> 41:09.762
Are you ready, Sebastian?

41:11.114 --> 41:12.064
Recording.

41:13.382 --> 41:16.018
Answer it.

41:19.906 --> 41:21.190
<i>Maman?</i>

41:21.224 --> 41:22.390
Oh, God!

41:22.408 --> 41:24.943
<i>Please pay.</i>
<i>These people have killed.</i>

41:24.994 --> 41:26.728
<i>They will hurt me.</i>

41:26.746 --> 41:28.413
The ransom is 10 million Euros,

41:28.448 --> 41:30.382
<i>by 6:00 P.M. tonight.</i>

41:35.004 --> 41:36.438
But...

41:36.473 --> 41:37.673
The insurance lapsed.

41:37.707 --> 41:39.091
I need more time.

41:39.125 --> 41:40.342
<i>6:00 P.M.</i>

41:40.376 --> 41:42.678
It's only 10 hours!
I need more time.

41:42.712 --> 41:43.829
You don't have any more time.

41:52.750 --> 41:55.970
