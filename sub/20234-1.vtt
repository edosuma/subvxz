01:31.920 --> 01:35.310
<i>This story consists of my recollections</i>
<i>of a very unusual young man... </i>

01:35.480 --> 01:38.552
<i>... with whom I was thrown</i>
<i>into contact at long intervals. </i>

01:38.720 --> 01:40.756
<i>In the summer of 1919... </i>

01:40.920 --> 01:43.878
. <i>... while passing through Chicago</i>
<i>on my way to the Far East... </i>

01:44.040 --> 01:46.235
<i>... a friend of mine, Elliott Templeton... </i>

01:46.400 --> 01:48.436
<i>... whom I had known</i>
<i>in London and Paris... </i>

01:48.600 --> 01:52.070
<i>... invited me to dine with him</i>
<i>and his sister, Mrs. Bradley. </i>

01:52.240 --> 01:55.630
<i>They were giving a dinner party at</i>
<i>one of those sprawling country clubs... </i>

01:55.800 --> 01:58.189
<i>... which were so much a part</i>
<i>of the American scene... </i>

01:58.360 --> 02:00.510
<i>... in the early days</i>
<i>of the postwar boom. </i>

02:20.880 --> 02:23.474
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Mr. Templeton's table.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.517
- Yes, sir.
- Are they here?

02:25.680 --> 02:28.069
They're having refreshments, sir.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.189
- Oh, here you are.
- With a dry martini, sir.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.510
Prohibition, of all the bloody nonsense.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.159
- Elliott.
- Yes, dear?

02:51.320 --> 02:53.151
Who is this man
that you asked to dinner?

02:53.320 --> 02:55.880
I had to get Sophie last minute
or we woulïve been 13.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.828
He's an English author. He's quite
all right. In fact, he's really quite famous.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.911
So pretend that you've heard of him.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.275
That's too much. Get the other glasses.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.557
Elliott, you must be slipping
if you frequent authors.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.871
Not at all, my dear.
Authors go everywhere nowadays.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.589
Why, in London, I even met actors
and actresses in society.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.956
Here he is now.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.555
My dear fellow,
how very nice to see you.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.789
Hello, Elliott.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.838
Let me present you to my sister,
Mrs. Bradley.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.592
Louisa.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.273
Louisa, dear,
this is Mr. Somerset Maugham.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.352
How do you do, Mr. Maugham?
It's an honor to have you with us.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.238
Thank you. It's very nice to be here.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.709
What on earth are you doing
in this benighted city?

03:38.880 --> 03:42.111
I'm just passing through, but you,
I thought you never left Paris.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.508
Why should I?

03:43.680 --> 03:46.319
In fact, I came to see my sister
and my niece, Isabel.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.278
I haven't been back
since before the war.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.957
I hope you don't mind, a few
young things are joining us for dinner...

03:53.120 --> 03:54.599
...but we can leave early.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.070
Why should I mind? I like young things
if they're good to look at.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.358
Incidentally, you'll meet the young man
my niece has got herself engaged to.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.229
His name is Larry Darrell, and I'll tell you
that Elliott doesn't approve of him.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.188
I have nothing against him, but he hasn't
any money. And my sister's not rich.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.316
- She needs all she's got.
- Elliott...

04:12.480 --> 04:15.358
...is it necessary to tell Mr. Maugham
all our private affairs?

04:15.520 --> 04:18.671
- We can't all be millionaires, Elliott.
- He hasn't even got a job.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.956
- He can get one.
- He doesn't want a job.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.839
- Why not?
- Because he's bone idle.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.549
That must shock a man like you
who's never earned a penny in his life.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.555
It may have escaped your notice,
my dear fellow...

04:30.720 --> 04:32.836
...but I am not an ordinary man.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.118
- Cocktail?
- Oh, yes, please.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.475
For the run of mankind,
industry is essential.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.757
I see no reason why this man
my niece has got herself engaged to...

04:40.920 --> 04:44.196
...should not conform
to the customs of his country.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.838
Here's my niece now.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.352
Oh, Mother.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.068
- Hello, Isabel.
- Hello.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.038
- This is my daughter, Isabel.
- How do you do, Mr. Maugham?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.270
- Where's Larry?
- Late.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.035
Poor sweet. I suppose he forgot
to wind his watch last night as usual.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.952
You wouldn't know about Larry.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.997
Say, Mother, you've mixed up
the cards...

05:11.160 --> 05:12.673
- Oh, Sophie, dear.
- Hello, Sophie.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.276
This is Sophie Nelson. Sophie
is a neighbor of ours in the country.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.351
- How do you do?
- You look charming, Sophie.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.636
Yes, doesn't she? Excuse us.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.758
Come here.
I want to have a look at you.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.469
- Sophie, you look lovely.
- It's the dress.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.279
- You sure you don't mind my wearing it?
- Of course not.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.750
- Lf you like it, take it as a present.
- Oh, that's awfully sweet of you.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.878
Oh, it'll be such a surprise for Bob
to see me decently dressed.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.430
Oh, you know Bob's much too much in
love with you to notice what you wear.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.876
He's no more crazy about me
than I am about him.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.715
I don't think anyone ever loved
anyone as I love him.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.440
- Isn't it heavenly to be alive?
- Yes.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.919
- Hi.
- Hello, Gray.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.718
- Hello, Gray.
- May I break this up?

05:53.880 --> 05:55.108
Sure.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.759
Hello.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.868
- You look lovely.
- Think so?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.477
- Hello, Sophie.
- Hello.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.278
May I get you one, Miss...?

06:05.440 --> 06:07.431
- Miss Nelson, isn't it?
- Yes, Sophie Nelson.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.113
I'd love it.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.998
No, I guess I'd better not.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.628
- Why? What's wrong with cocktails?
- Oh, nothing.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.075
Only, I promised Bob I wouldn't.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.390
- Who's Bob?
- My boyfriend.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.757
He doesn't like me to drink.
He thinks I'm too fond of it.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.912
- Which is Bob?
- Oh, he isn't here. He's working.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.230
He's putting himself
through law school.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.311
He's gonna drop in later
and take me home.

06:29.480 --> 06:32.392
Will you have one of these?
If my man Joseph could see me now...

06:32.560 --> 06:35.518
...I give you my word,
he'd faint dead away.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.471
You're a great friend
of Mr. Templeton's.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.553
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Elliott has
no friends, only acquaintances.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.355
- He's an awful snob, isn't he?
- Oh, awful. But he's kind and generous.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.478
People laugh at him, but they eat
his food and drink his wine.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.513
Oh, Mr. Maugham. Mr. Maugham,
you're next to Mother.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.511
And Sophie, you're next to Gray.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.114
- That's us, toots.
- Mr. Maugham, Mr. Maturin.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.508
- Isabel.
- Yes?

06:58.680 --> 07:01.353
- Dinner, my dear fellow.
- Oh, yes.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.830
And who's Mr. Maturin?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.389
Oh, Gray. He's our millionaire.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.630
His father's a big broker.
We're proud of him.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.519
He gives us class. But he's nice.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.877
I know several girls who'd stop
at nothing short of murder to get him.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.156
- They haven't a chance.
- Why not?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.595
He's so in love with Isabel
he can't see straight.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.070
I see. And she's in love
with Larry Darrell.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.992
I suppose that does
complicate matters.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.391
It does, if you're as
high-principled as Gray is.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.551
And Larry isn't here.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.269
Yes, he's just coming in now,
way over there. Look.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.476
Come on, dinner.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.554
<i>This is the young man</i>
<i>of whom I write. </i>

07:58.720 --> 08:00.392
<i>He is not famous. </i>

08:00.560 --> 08:03.552
<i>It may be that when his life</i>
<i>at last comes to an end... </i>

08:03.720 --> 08:06.951
<i>... he will leave no more trace</i>
<i>of his sojourn on this earth... </i>

08:07.120 --> 08:11.477
<i>... than a stone thrown into a river</i>
<i>leaves on the surface of the water. </i>

08:11.640 --> 08:15.110
<i>Yet it may be that the way of life</i>
<i>he has chosen for himself... </i>

08:15.280 --> 08:18.875
<i>... may have an ever-growing influence</i>
<i>over his fellow men... </i>

08:19.040 --> 08:21.156
<i>... so that, </i>
<i>long after his death perhaps... </i>

08:21.320 --> 08:27.190
<i>... it may be realized that there lived</i>
<i>in this age a very remarkable creature. </i>

08:28.000 --> 08:29.911
- You're very late, Larry.
- I'm sorry.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.718
Sophie, where is Mr. Maugham?

08:31.880 --> 08:35.030
Larry hasn't learned that punctuality
is the politeness of kings.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.589
Elliott. Mr. Maugham,
this is Larry Darrell.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.275
- When can we start dinner?
- Mr. Maugham's a novelist, darling.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.432
I may as well tell you that Larry's
very stupid and uneducated.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.239
He knows nothing
about anything except flying.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.960
When he came back,
he looked so lovely in his uniform...

08:50.120 --> 08:52.918
...I camped on his doorstep
until he consented to marry me.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.799
- The competition was awful.
- Don't believe a word she says.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.269
Isabel's not a bad girl,
but she's a terrible liar.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.158
- Dinner.
- Oh, yes.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.311
I've seen you before.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.953
Oh, when?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.839
I happened to have work to do,
and I went into the library.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.319
I saw you there this morning.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.755
When I came back from lunch,
you were still there.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.229
- I forgot about lunch.
- I couldn't help admiring...

09:13.400 --> 09:14.879
...your power of concentration.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.951
- It was that kind of a book.
- My fellow...

09:17.120 --> 09:19.588
...you're at the end of the table
with my sister.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.956
- Hello, Gray.
- Hi there.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.918
Say, Dad tells me you turned down
that job in the office.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.594
Oh, Larry, why have you done that?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.593
I thought it over, and I figured
I'd be a disappointment...

09:30.760 --> 09:33.877
...so I decided I'd better refuse.
- Sorry, old man.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.679
It would have been swell,
us working together.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.152
Hi. Looks as if tall, dark and legal
is standing you up tonight.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.595
I'd like to catch him trying it.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.320
- You're old friends?
- We grew up together.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.914
I used to play shortstop
on his baseball team.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.469
We used to think we could lick
any 10 kids our size.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.154
- And could you?
- We tried.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.278
Oh, here comes my young man now.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.156
- Well, here you are.
- Hello.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.035
This is Mr. Maugham. Bob MacDonald.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.519
- How do you do?
- How are you?

10:35.680 --> 10:38.114
He's the one who seems to think
he wants to marry me.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.669
I can't see why, but there it is.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.195
I just happen to be crazy
about the girl.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.079
I wouldn't like him to know,
but just between you and me...

10:46.240 --> 10:49.550
...I rather like him myself.
- Let's dance.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.669
- Hello, Isabel.
- Hello.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.594
Larry, why didn't you tell me that
Mr. Maturin had offered you a job?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.159
What?

11:26.280 --> 11:29.955
Larry, why didn't you tell me that
Mr. Maturin had offered you a job?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.592
Answer me.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.512
Answer me.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.430
Well, I thought I'd better not until
I made up my mind one way or another.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.589
You mad?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.751
Darling, that's the horrible part
about you.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.957
However aggravating you are,
one can't really be angry with you.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.031
Oh, can't they?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.470
Did you see those looks
Elliott was giving me?

11:52.640 --> 11:54.551
Well, after all, Larry, a man must work.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.598
And the longer you put it off,
the harder it'll be.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.797
I've got a foolish notion I want
to do more than just sell bonds.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.791
All right, then.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.110
- Go into a law office.
- I don't wanna do that either.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.516
What do you want to do then?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.478
I don't know.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.034
Loaf, maybe.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.715
Oh, Larry, don't be funny.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.711
This is serious.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.513
I'm not being funny.
I think it's very serious.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.960
I wouldn't make you miserable
for anything.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.793
But you are making me miserable.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.196
You see, I love you.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.590
And I love you, Isabel.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.629
Look, Larry, let's be sensible.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.308
A man must work.
It's a matter of self-respect.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.189
This is a young country, and it's a
man's duty to take part in its activities.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.430
Gray's father was saying
only the other day...

13:14.600 --> 13:17.990
...that we're beginning an era that
will make the past look like 30 cents.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.469
He said that he can see
no limit to our progress...

13:20.640 --> 13:25.430
...and that by 1930, we'll be the greatest
and richest country in the whole world.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.717
- Don't you think that's terribly exciting?
- Terribly.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.235
Why, there never was such a chance
for a young man.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.709
I'd have thought
you'd be proud to be a part of it.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.793
- It's such a wonderful adventure.
- I'm sure you're right, Isabel.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.394
The Armours and Swifts
will pack more and better meat.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.596
The McCormicks will turn
out more harvesters.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.672
Henry Ford will make more cars,
and everybody will get richer.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.832
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.960
Nothing. It just happens
that sitting in an office...

13:53.120 --> 13:55.350
...and making a lot of money
doesn't interest me.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.313
Oh, don't talk like a fool.
You can't live without money.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.553
I have a little. That's what gives me
the chance to do what I want.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.551
You're making it very difficult for me.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.473
I'm sorry, darling.
I wouldn't if I could help it.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.114
You can help it.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.432
Yes?

14:19.640 --> 14:22.837
The dead look so terribly dead
when they're dead.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.913
- What does that mean, exactly?
- Just that.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.355
Are you terribly unhappy, darling?

14:30.520 --> 14:34.274
No, the only thing that makes me
unhappy is making you unhappy.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.953
I don't think I'll ever find peace
until I make up my mind about things.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.198
It's so difficult to put into words. The
minute you try, you feel embarrassed.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.349
You say to yourself, "Who am I to bother
my head about this, that or the other?

14:49.520 --> 14:53.308
Isn't it better to follow the beaten path
and let what's coming to you come?"

14:54.480 --> 14:56.277
And then I think...

14:57.360 --> 14:59.271
...of a guy I knew.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.671
A minute before, he was
full of life and fun, and then...

15:04.200 --> 15:05.997
...he was dead.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.911
I've seen many men die,
but this one was different.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.357
It was the last day of the war,
almost the last moment.

15:19.520 --> 15:24.036
He coulïve saved himself,
but he didn't. He saved me and died.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.229
So he's gone,
and I'm here alive. Why?

15:29.400 --> 15:30.958
It's all so meaningless.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.680
You can't help but ask yourself
what life is all about.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.594
Whether there's any sense to it
or whether it's just a stupid blunder.

15:48.880 --> 15:53.317
I hardly know what to say.
It's so unexpected.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.797
Larry, do you think it would help
if you went away for a while?

16:01.960 --> 16:05.669
- I think perhaps it would.
- Then why don't you go?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.437
Because of you.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.639
Larry, let's be frank with each other.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.553
There's no place in your life
for me just now.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.711
Does that mean you don't
want to be engaged?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.791
Oh, no, foolish.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.599
It means that I'm prepared to wait.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.997
It might be a year, or even longer.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.231
That doesn't matter.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.277
It might be less.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.670
Where have you thought of going?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.478
Where?

16:43.280 --> 16:45.430
Well, I thought I'd start
by going to Paris.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.114
I went there several times on leave.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.316
I've got it into my head that there...

16:50.480 --> 16:53.199
...everything that's muddled
in my mind...

16:54.040 --> 16:55.837
...would grow clear.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.992
It's a funny place.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.994
It gives you the feeling that you can
think out your thoughts to the very end.

17:02.760 --> 17:06.116
I think over there I may be able
to see my way before me.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.471
And if you don't?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.239
I'll give it up as a bad job...

17:13.400 --> 17:16.631
...come back to Chicago,
and take the first work I can get.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.791
Oh, my darling.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.757
Oh, Larry.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.069
I love you.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.753
I love you so much.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.309
I cannot for the life of me
understand how Isabel...

17:40.480 --> 17:44.268
...could possibly prefer that young man
to a fine chap like Gray.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.113
Oh, I grant you, he's good-looking.
And his clothes fit.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.157
But imagine, an opportunity...

17:49.320 --> 17:52.869
...to go in with Gray and his father
on the ground floor.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.712
Isabel.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.071
Home so early?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.718
Yes.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.630
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.476
- Where's Larry?
- Gone. Hello, Mother.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.868
- Did you have a talk?
- Yes.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.350
- May I venture to inquire the result?
- He's going to Europe for a while.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.034
- I promised to wait.
- What is he going to do in Europe?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.270
- Loaf.
- Loaf? Don't be ridiculous.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.556
- It's what he said.
- I have no patience with you.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.314
If you had any spirit, you'd have
broken off your engagement.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.993
What can I do?

18:26.160 --> 18:29.357
- I love him.
- Come along.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.752
It's all right.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.830
Well, things might be
a great deal worse.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.719
Oh, thank heavens.
<i>Merci</i>, Joseph.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.713
I was just saying, Louisa,
things might be a great deal worse.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.314
Don't get up. I don't see how.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.109
My poor Louisa,
you have no imagination.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.113
When you're young, your emotions
are violent, but not durable.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.919
It's a delusion that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.318
With Larry out
and Gray on the spot...

18:57.480 --> 18:59.596
...I don't see why Isabel
shouldn't marry him.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.069
You've been away from America
too long, Elliott.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.515
In this country,
a girl doesn't marry a man...

19:04.680 --> 19:08.036
...because her mother,
or even her uncle, wants her to.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.316
That's nothing to be proud of, Louisa.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.472
As a result of 30 years' experience,
I may tell you that a marriage arranged...

19:13.640 --> 19:17.599
...with a regard for position and fortune
has every advantage over a love match.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.594
In France, which, after all, is
the only civilized country in the world...

19:21.760 --> 19:24.832
...Isabel would marry Gray
without thinking about it twice.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.594
After a few months,
if she was still in love with Larry...

19:27.760 --> 19:32.276
That will do. I know what you're going
to say. The idea doesn't appeal to me.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.432
That's one of the things I've never
understood about you, Louisa.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.716
Though you've lived half your life
in diplomatic society...

19:37.880 --> 19:41.714
...in half the capitals of the world,
you've remained hopelessly American.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.155
It isn't often that you pay me
a compliment, dear.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.629
- It wasn't meant to be one.
- I know.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.233
Well, I think I'll go to bed.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.958
- Will you lock up?
- Yes, dear.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.350
- Good night, Mr. Maugham.
- Good night.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.429
You're very full of worldly wisdom
this evening.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.830
Have you ever known me not to be?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.072
I don't mind telling you,
I have a sneaking sympathy for the boy.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.276
He's young and wants
to sow his wild oats...

20:04.440 --> 20:08.115
...before he settles down to married life.
Very natural and very proper.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.316
I'll keep my eye on him in Paris.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.994
Of course, he must cross
on the <i>Aquitania</i>.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.275
<i>I know the captain. </i>

20:14.440 --> 20:18.115
<i>He'll see that Larry sits at his table</i>
<i>and meets the right people. </i>

20:18.640 --> 20:22.076
<i>I'll look for an apartment for him</i>
<i>in a really smart quarter. </i>

20:22.240 --> 20:24.151
<i>I'll do him proud. </i>

20:24.320 --> 20:26.629
<i>I'll give some parties for him. </i>

20:26.800 --> 20:30.475
<i>So many Americans, when they go</i>
<i>to Paris, get in with the wrong people. </i>

20:30.640 --> 20:34.030
<i>And then they find it no end</i>
<i>of a job to shake them off. </i>

20:34.400 --> 20:38.234
<i>I'll have my chauffeur, Marcel, </i>
<i>drive him about in the Rolls. </i>

20:38.400 --> 20:40.675
<i>I detest the countryside. </i>

20:40.840 --> 20:43.035
<i>But alas, all Americans</i>
<i>are born tourists... </i>

20:43.200 --> 20:46.317
<i>... and no doubt, </i>
<i>he'll want to see the sights. </i>

20:47.400 --> 20:50.233
<i>It would be perfect if I could arrange</i>
<i>for some older woman... </i>

20:50.400 --> 20:52.277
<i>... to take him under her wing. </i>

20:52.440 --> 20:55.750
<i>Princess Novemali, for instance. </i>

20:55.920 --> 20:58.480
<i>He is young and he has a good figure. </i>

20:58.640 --> 21:02.713
<i>I think she'd fall for him</i>
<i>like a ton of bricks. </i>

21:05.760 --> 21:07.591
<i>In any event, the busier I keep him... </i>

21:07.760 --> 21:10.752
<i>... the less time he'll have</i>
<i>to think about Isabel. </i>

21:21.600 --> 21:23.716
Anything for Lawrence Darrell?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.437
This wireless came
day before yesterday.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.079
Thank you.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.716
Excuse me. Pardon me, when does
the boat train from the <i>Aquitania</i> arrive?

21:35.880 --> 21:38.155
- Eleven-thirty, monsieur.
- Thank you.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.632
Why, of course, madame.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.758
Larry! Larry!

21:55.760 --> 21:57.716
Oh, Larry.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.875
Oh, Larry, I've missed you.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.554
I've missed you so much.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.837
May I ask how he knew
you were coming?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.718
Isabel cabled him from the ship.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.110
- Are they still engaged?
- As far as I know.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.919
- What about Gray Maturin?
- Still faithful.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.150
I don't believe you've played
your cards well.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.709
- I never had much card sense.
- Mother, here he is.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.394
- Oh, how good of you to come.
- So nice to see you.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.118
- Hello.
- How do you do?

22:28.280 --> 22:31.716
- May Larry come to dinner with us?
- I understand Larry doesn't dine out.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.518
- He will tonight. Won't you?
- I will.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.035
That's very good of you.
I shall be delighted.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.599
We'll meet you at the house.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.274
Taxi. Taxi.

22:40.440 --> 22:44.911
Come along, darling.
I've got a million things to tell you.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.279
I'm afraid I haven't a very good account
to give you of that young man, Louisa.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.271
When he first came to Paris,
for Isabel's sake, I asked him to lunch...

23:07.440 --> 23:09.556
...to meet the sort of people
he ought to know.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.314
- And he told me he didn't eat lunch.
- Perhaps he doesn't.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.029
When I asked him to dinner, he couldn't
because he had no evening clothes.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.357
If I live to be 100, I shall never
understand how any young man...

23:20.520 --> 23:22.954
...could come to Paris
without evening clothes.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.032
Maybe he just didn't want to.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.159
That's the most incredible reason
for refusing an invitation I've ever heard.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.356
- And where does he live?
- I haven't a notion.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.034
Isabel writes to him in care
of the American Express.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.309
Like a traveling salesman,
or a schoolteacher on vacation.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.711
My own belief is that he's living
in the Latin Quarter with some bit...

23:41.880 --> 23:43.757
...who's no better
than she ought to be.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.957
I'm afraid you'll have to write him off
as one of your failures.

23:47.120 --> 23:52.148
It might surprise you to know it,
my dear, but I've already done so.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.436
She speaks so quickly
I can't understand her.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.239
It's an old French custom.
Everyone has to wear a sprig...

24:14.400 --> 24:17.631
...of lilies of the valley on May Day.
They're a symbol of happiness.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.715
May Day. Imagine it's being May.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.714
- I've been here nearly a month now.
- Oh, impossible. It was only yesterday.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.440
I still don't know a thing
about what you've been doing.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.558
Tell me, Larry. You must know
I've been dying to know.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.995
Oh, nothing very exciting.
I've traveled around...

24:34.160 --> 24:36.355
...read a lot, gone to lectures
at the Sorbonne.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.034
Have you found that peace of mind
you were looking for?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.873
No, but for the first time,
I see things in a clear light.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.270
What does that mean?

24:44.600 --> 24:48.434
It's rather difficult to explain. And even
if I try, you'll only be angry with me.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.398
How much longer do you think
all this is going to take you?

24:51.560 --> 24:55.838
I don't know. I don't know.
It's hard to say.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.999
And after that, what are you going
to do with all this wisdom?

25:06.760 --> 25:10.878
If I ever acquire wisdom, I suppose I'll be
wise enough to know what to do with it.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.795
You know what Uncle Elliott says.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.678
Nothing to my credit, I imagine.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.752
He says you have a cozy
little hideout somewhere.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.959
Come and see for yourself. The cozy
little hideout's only a step from here.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.354
- Monsieur Darrell.
- Madame Duval, Mademoiselle Bradley.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.750
- <i>Bonjour</i>.
- Monsieur Jacques Duval.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.397
Did you see the looks they gave me?

25:46.560 --> 25:48.869
Ruined my character,
that's what you've done.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.873
This is where you live?

26:12.040 --> 26:14.474
- You don't like it.
- No.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.313
Well, it's all right. It's convenient.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.916
How about a cup of coffee?

26:25.640 --> 26:29.110
Larry, how can you bear to sit here
in a backwash when America's...

26:29.280 --> 26:33.034
...living through the most glorious
adventure the world has ever known?

26:33.200 --> 26:36.636
You've been away a year now,
a whole year out of your life.

26:36.800 --> 26:41.032
You just can't go on loafing forever.
Or can you?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.555
- It's possible.
- And what about me?

26:43.720 --> 26:45.790
Am I of no importance to you at all?

26:45.960 --> 26:47.791
You're of great importance
to me, Isabel.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.520
- I love you. I want you to marry me.
- When, in 10 years?

26:50.680 --> 26:52.352
- No, as soon as possible.
- On what?

26:52.520 --> 26:55.114
- I've got $3000 a year.
- Oh, Larry.

26:55.280 --> 27:00.035
- Lots of people live on a great deal less.
- I don't want to live on $3000 a year.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.192
I never have,
and I don't see why I should.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.591
We could go to Capri
for our honeymoon.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.194
And then in the fall,
we could go to Greece.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.558
Remember how we used to talk
about traveling together?

27:15.920 --> 27:18.229
Of course I want to travel.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.879
But not like that.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.793
Cheap restaurants, third-rate hotels.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.393
Besides...

27:24.560 --> 27:26.676
...I want to have babies, Larry.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.833
- All right, we'll take them along with us.
- Oh, Larry, you're so impractical.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.514
You don't know what you're
asking me to do. I'm young.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.990
I want to have fun,
do all the things people do.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.037
We wouldn't have a friend
in the world.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.589
Oh, Isabel, stop exaggerating.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.069
We'll do everything you want.
We'll do it together.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.470
Oh, listen.
If you hadn't a cent to your name...

27:46.640 --> 27:51.270
...and got a job that brought you $3000
a year, I'd marry you without hesitation.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.273
I'd cook for you. I'd make beds.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.829
I wouldn't care what I wore.
I'd think it was fun.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.878
I'd know it was only a question of time
until you'd make good.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.635
But this means living like this all
our lives with nothing to look forward to.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.109
It's asking too much.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.356
Oh, Larry, you've had your fling now.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.114
For your own sake, I beg of you
to come home with us.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.840
But I wouldn't make you happy if I did.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.879
You see, what you forget is that
I want to learn as passionately as...

28:18.040 --> 28:21.271
...well, as Gray, for example,
wants to make a lot of money.

28:26.680 --> 28:31.595
I came over here because I was restless,
and because my mind was muddled.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.718
I came looking for the answers
to a lot of questions.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.518
Some of them I've found.

28:36.680 --> 28:40.559
Others I may never find.
But I can't stop now.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.869
Oh, I know it sounds vague
and trivial compared with... .

28:45.080 --> 28:48.197
Well, compared with everything
that's happening at home today.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.999
And I know I'm being very difficult.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.874
But I can't stop now, Isabel.
I just can't.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.315
What would happen to America
if everyone did as you're doing?

28:56.480 --> 28:59.278
The answer to that is that
everyone doesn't feel as I do.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.512
Fortunately, most people are content
to follow the normal course...

29:02.680 --> 29:04.875
...and take things as they are.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.235
Oh, I wish I could too.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.757
But I know if I tried, I'd just make
a mess of your life, and of mine too.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.679
But...

29:15.240 --> 29:17.959
...what's this all going to lead to?

29:19.320 --> 29:21.038
I don't know.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.520
It may be that I will find
something to give...

29:24.680 --> 29:26.910
...that people will be glad to take.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.431
It's just a chance. But even if I fail,
I shan't be any worse off...

29:30.600 --> 29:33.797
...than a fellow who's gone into
business and hasn't made a go of it.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.068
Then there's nothing more to be said.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.392
Here you are.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.438
Isabel.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.274
Wear this on another finger, please.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.876
- We're still friends.
- Of course.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.437
Shall we go?

30:21.760 --> 30:24.035
Well, go on, go on.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.868
I don't believe it.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.634
Do you realize that in the two months
you've been here...

30:29.800 --> 30:31.756
...I haven't won a game?

30:40.360 --> 30:42.316
- Who's winning?
- I am.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.993
Good.

30:47.200 --> 30:51.193
Well, I must say, Isabel's taking it very
well. Has she told you what happened?

30:51.360 --> 30:54.636
Only that she and Larry came to
the conclusion they'd made a mistake.

30:54.800 --> 30:58.634
- Has she written to Gray?
- I'm not in the habit of opening her mail.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.509
If you ask me, she's very well out of it.
There was a physical attraction...

31:02.680 --> 31:04.511
...but that's all...
- Here she is.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.717
- Good night, Mother.
- Don't be too late.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.718
Remember we have to catch
the boat train in the morning.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.791
You're very dressed up.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.951
- You seem to be going somewhere.
- Yes.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.792
- Where?
- Oh, nowhere in particular.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.952
- Larry and I are going out on the town.
- Larry?

31:20.120 --> 31:22.190
We thought we'd spend
our last night together.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.715
"Evening," I trust you mean.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.233
I'm profoundly shocked.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.675
If he had any decency,
he'd never have asked you.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.752
But he didn't ask me. I asked him.

31:31.920 --> 31:35.230
- You should forbid her to go.
- Will you pay any attention to me if I do?

31:35.400 --> 31:36.992
- No, darling, none.
- In that case...

31:37.160 --> 31:39.674
...I don't think there's any point
in my forbidding it.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.470
Pretty dress she had on.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.037
I hadn't realized
it was cut quite so low.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.200
I've never seen you so beautiful.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.115
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.513
Will you come in
and have one last drink?

37:13.280 --> 37:14.872
Yes.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.995
It's late. You'd better go.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.394
Oh, Larry, for heaven's sakes, go!

38:38.520 --> 38:40.397
Please, Larry.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.072
Larry.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.037
Uncle Elliott.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.554
That was a brilliant performance,
my dear.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.797
I left the door just a little open.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.553
Shall I get you a drink?
I expect you want it.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.272
You think you're very clever,
don't you?

39:53.800 --> 39:56.268
I don't think it, I know it.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.756
Come, come, child, be reasonable.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.916
I guessed you were up to something.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.350
Even your mother noticed
the pains you went to...

40:04.560 --> 40:06.994
...to make yourself alluring tonight.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.237
You're hateful.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.230
But no fool, my angel.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.675
Am I right that you thought if you
could get him to come back here...

40:17.840 --> 40:21.719
...it was almost inevitable
that the inevitable should happen?

40:26.120 --> 40:29.078
No one could put it more delicately.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.440
We know what the consequences
may be when a poor girl...

40:33.640 --> 40:35.676
...strays from the narrow path
of virtue.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.154
Do we?

40:37.360 --> 40:40.158
My guess is that if your
unscrupulous plan had come off...

40:40.360 --> 40:44.239
...it wouldn't have been long
before Larry got a letter from you...

40:44.440 --> 40:47.716
...telling him to come back at once
and make an honest woman of you.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.388
You can be wonderfully disagreeable
when you like.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.717
I know, it's one
of my most cherished gifts.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.430
Why didn't you go through with it?

40:58.480 --> 40:59.879
When I looked into his eyes...

41:00.080 --> 41:03.072
...and saw he hadn't the slightest idea
I'd set a trap for him...

41:03.280 --> 41:05.953
...I couldn't bring myself
to play such a dirty trick.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.515
I couldn't help myself.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.631
I suppose it was my better nature.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.838
Nonsense. It was your sound
Middle Western horse sense.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.600
You'd have been mad
to have married him.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.631
I wonder.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.039
Believe me,
when you've put the Atlantic...

41:25.240 --> 41:29.392
...between you and that young man,
you won't care two straws for him.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.670
Trust your Uncle Elliott.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.599
He's a very wise old party.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.198
Mr. Maturin, the cake.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.116
Here's a knife, Miss Isabel.
I mean, Mrs. Maturin.

41:53.320 --> 41:56.039
- What do I do with it?
- Gray, you get in. You're in on this.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.596
- I told you what to do. Take her hand.
- Nothing would please me more.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.234
Darling, this is the nicest wedding
I've ever been to.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.000
- We shoulïve thought of this sooner.
- Uncle Elliott...

42:05.200 --> 42:08.590
...how do brides cut cakes in France?
- With a knife, dear.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.473
- Now make a wish, Gray.
- I don't have to.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.631
I've got my wish.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.436
I've never understood why, when
there's so much space in the world...

42:20.640 --> 42:23.837
...people should deliberately choose
to live in the Middle West.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.390
What in heaven's name is this?

42:26.600 --> 42:28.113
Is it alone?

42:28.280 --> 42:30.271
Doesn't it come with something?
What is it?

42:30.440 --> 42:33.796
- It could be a pickle fork.
- A pickle fork.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.150
Two ninety-eight, no doubt,
at Ye Gifte Shoppe.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.193
Four fifty, Mr. Templeton,
at Obendorfer's.

42:39.400 --> 42:43.598
- We know, because we sent it.
- Charming. Is it for use or ornament?

42:43.800 --> 42:45.074
Both.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.589
Remember me? We met
the last time I was in Chicago.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.711
- I certainly do, Mr. Maugham.
- Hello, sir.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.478
Sophie.

42:51.680 --> 42:55.514
Oh, darling, how sweet of you
and Bob to come.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.312
Let me see you.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.670
- Oh, you look beautiful, Isabel.
- Think so?

42:59.880 --> 43:03.190
Like a million dollars.
Or should I say 20 million?

43:03.400 --> 43:05.311
Darling, we never see you
and Bob anymore.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.873
Where do you hide yourselves?

43:07.080 --> 43:09.594
Just at present, for reasons
best known to ourselves...

43:09.800 --> 43:12.314
...we don't mix with the rich.
- We find it expensive.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.158
- How's the kid, Bob?
- Fine.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.715
- Would you like...?
- Oh, please, darling, not now.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.115
I'd love to come see you.
Where do you live now?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.151
In a walk-up apartment
on the North Side.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.557
I'd ask you to dinner, only I'm afraid
you won't care for my cooking.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.553
Don't you believe her.
She's the best darn cook in Chicago.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.796
All's well that ends well.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.639
And I must say, they make
a very attractive couple.

43:32.840 --> 43:35.354
Oh, no.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.120
- I hope they'll be happy.
- Why shouldn't they be happy?

43:38.320 --> 43:40.276
They have everything
to make them happy.

43:40.480 --> 43:44.234
Money, position, a nice house.
And Gray's father can't live forever.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.351
What about Larry?
Heard anything about him?

43:46.560 --> 43:50.269
Good heavens, no. As soon
as Isabel and Louisa went away...

43:50.440 --> 43:54.035
...I dropped him like a hot potato.
A most undesirable young man.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.516
I tried to find him the last time
I was in Paris, but I couldn't.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.352
I wonder what's happened to him.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.835
Shall I tell you something,
my dear fellow?

44:02.040 --> 44:04.952
I don't care a row of beans.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.235
- Hey, Kosti.
- How about a beer?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.709
- Well, I would like to wash up first.
- Oh, come on.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.957
It's good, clean dirt.
You can wash later.

45:09.120 --> 45:13.716
A couple of beers, sweetheart.
And a deck of cards.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.635
I looked for you last night.
You were out.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.637
Was she pretty?

45:19.840 --> 45:22.798
You're wrong. I went
to a lecture at the university.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.991
Missed the bus.
I walked back in the rain.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.553
- It serves you right.
- Why?

45:26.720 --> 45:29.234
Enlightenment is a curse
of civilization.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.989
A man who wastes his energy
on knowledge is a fool.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.476
The more he learns, the more he wants,
and the more unhappy he becomes.

45:36.680 --> 45:40.639
Tear down the schoolhouses,
burn the books, strangle the teachers.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.752
Then the world can get somewhere.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.917
The beer.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.316
And the cards.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.235
We'll play for the drinks.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.117
Why should a man who wants to
develop his brain work in a coalmine?

45:56.320 --> 45:59.756
Answer me that. You could have
gotten a soft job on the surface.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.110
I wanted to work below.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.438
Hiding out, are you?

46:04.640 --> 46:05.959
- Police after you?
- No.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.832
- A woman?
- No, I just thought...

46:08.040 --> 46:10.235
...it'd do me good
to work up a sweat.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.749
What have the other Poles
told you about me?

46:12.960 --> 46:17.317
Not much. They advised me not to play
cards with you because you cheat.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.479
- Do you think it's true?
- Yes. I know it is.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.716
Then why do you play with me?

46:23.920 --> 46:25.512
For the fun of it.

46:25.720 --> 46:27.870
I've been watching.
I can't see how it's done.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.513
You never will, my boy.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.917
I shouldn't have thought it worth
your while just for a few drinks.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.712
I like to keep my hand in.

46:34.920 --> 46:37.639
What are you going to do
when you get enough of this?

46:37.840 --> 46:40.115
Go back to America?

46:40.560 --> 46:42.278
I will, I suppose, one of these days.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.040
- And do what?
- Sell bonds.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.755
You're a rum one, Larry.

46:49.960 --> 46:53.236
But what about the answers
to all those profound questions...

46:53.440 --> 46:55.078
...you have been asking yourself?

46:55.280 --> 46:58.317
Don't you know people have been
asking the same questions...

46:58.520 --> 47:00.511
...for thousands of years?

47:01.520 --> 47:04.432
Doesn't the fact that people have
asked those same questions...

47:04.640 --> 47:07.871
...for thousands of years only go
to prove that they can't help asking?

47:08.080 --> 47:11.072
Very good. Very good.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.759
You're not altogether stupid.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.679
As a matter of fact, you sound
like a very religious man...

47:15.880 --> 47:18.075
...who doesn't believe in God.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.439
I'm not sure that I believe in anything.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.194
Have you ever thought
of going to the East?

47:26.400 --> 47:28.038
No.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.310
India, for instance?

47:31.440 --> 47:35.069
I went there. I met a strange man.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.714
A man I never thought
to meet in this world.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.319
A saint.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.512
People go from all parts of India
to see him...

47:42.720 --> 47:46.508
...tell him their problems, ask
his advice and listen to his teaching.

47:46.720 --> 47:50.269
And they go away strengthened
in soul and at peace.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.756
But it's not his teaching
that's so remarkable.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.478
It's the man himself.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.877
- Did he help you?
- No. No.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.709
But that wasn't his fault.
It was mine.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.279
How did you ever come
to go to India?

48:08.120 --> 48:10.953
To escape my pursuer.
He followed me there.

48:11.160 --> 48:14.835
I've wallowed in the gutters
of half the seaports of Europe...

48:15.040 --> 48:18.669
...to put him off my track.
He was waiting for me.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.994
I know however far I flee,
one day he will come up with me...

48:23.200 --> 48:26.317
...and I shall feel the terrible hand...

48:26.880 --> 48:28.996
...on my shoulder.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.510
Wouldn't it be better
to take your punishment?

48:31.720 --> 48:33.438
You don't know
what the punishment is.

48:33.920 --> 48:37.595
It's not prison or the hangman's rope.
I could face that.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.756
It's mercy...

48:39.960 --> 48:42.349
...forgiveness, love.

48:43.960 --> 48:50.115
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that I'm a unfrocked priest?

48:52.240 --> 48:55.391
It's not the police
I'm running away from.

48:56.600 --> 49:00.388
I'd kill anyone who tried to arrest me.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.151
It's God.

49:13.840 --> 49:18.197
Get out, you fool!
I'm going to get drunk.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.032
Sorry we were interrupted.
They're pilgrims.

50:41.240 --> 50:46.360
They come from many places,
some from quite far distances.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.270
What has brought you here, my son?

50:52.160 --> 50:54.390
I've come to learn.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.829
Ever since the war,
I've been searching for something.

50:59.040 --> 51:02.828
Something that I've not been able
to put into words.

51:03.600 --> 51:07.957
I've been told that from you
I might find guidance.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.355
God is the only guide.

51:10.560 --> 51:14.269
But perhaps if we talk,
he may show me a way to help you.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.595
To my friends, I'm a loafer,
afraid of responsibilities.

51:18.960 --> 51:22.236
I can't even make those I love
understand what I'm after.

51:22.440 --> 51:25.238
The fact you've taken the time
to come this great distance...

51:25.440 --> 51:29.479
...in search of knowledge proves that
you're not afraid of responsibilities.

51:29.680 --> 51:35.312
Even to admit that you want to learn
is in itself courageous.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.839
I've studied, I've traveled, I've read
everything I could get my hands on...

51:41.040 --> 51:43.793
...and nothing seems to satisfy me.

51:44.120 --> 51:47.510
Oh, like everyone else, I want
to succeed, I want to improve...

51:47.720 --> 51:51.918
...but not necessarily in the terms
of what the world calls success.

51:52.400 --> 51:56.552
Somehow I've lost confidence
in the accepted values.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.800
I try to get excited at the prospect
of settling down...

51:59.960 --> 52:02.110
...minding my own business
and making good...

52:02.280 --> 52:05.716
...but it only increases my urge
to move on.

52:07.480 --> 52:10.392
I know that if I do find
what I'm looking for...

52:10.600 --> 52:13.637
...it will be something
that I can share with others.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.116
But how to find it, and where?

52:17.320 --> 52:20.551
All your restlessness and confusion
are not unique, my son.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.433
The whole world is restless
and confused.

52:23.640 --> 52:29.875
It will always be so, as long as men
set their ideals on the wrong objects.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.430
There can be no real happiness...

52:32.640 --> 52:36.679
...until men learn that it comes
from within themselves.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.632
I know.

52:39.840 --> 52:44.550
It is written that the wise man
lives from within himself...

52:44.760 --> 52:48.639
...which is from God,
from within his own heart.

52:48.840 --> 52:52.719
This is the way of calmness,
forbearance...

52:52.920 --> 52:56.799
...compassion, selflessness...

52:58.200 --> 53:00.475
...and everlasting peace.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.359
- But that's not easy.
- No.

53:06.160 --> 53:09.038
The road to salvation
is difficult to pass over.

53:09.240 --> 53:13.631
As difficult as the sharp edge
of a razor.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.637
But this much we know...

53:15.840 --> 53:18.308
...and all religions teach it.

53:18.560 --> 53:21.836
There is in every one of us
a spark of the infinite goodness...

53:22.000 --> 53:23.672
...which created us.

53:23.880 --> 53:26.599
And when we leave this earth,
we are reunited with it...

53:26.800 --> 53:29.268
...as a raindrop falling from heaven...

53:29.480 --> 53:33.712
...is at last reunited with the sea
which gave it birth.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.875
- May I stay here with you?
- Of course you may.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.197
Our life's very simple.
There are books.

53:51.400 --> 53:53.311
We will talk together.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.637
You can even work in the fields
if you wish.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.676
We Indians believe there are
three roads that lead to God.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.269
One is the path of faith and worship.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.711
One is the path of good works
performed for the love of God.

54:09.920 --> 54:14.710
And then there is a third path, which
leads through knowledge to wisdom.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.395
You have chosen
the way of knowledge.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.556
But you will find in the end, my son...

54:21.000 --> 54:24.072
...that the three paths
are but one path.

54:32.520 --> 54:35.592
One of my students
will show you where to sleep.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.512
Thank you.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.515
- Excuse me, please.
- Yes, sir.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.914
Operator?

55:07.120 --> 55:09.680
Michigan 7182.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.553
I wanna get Mr. Gray Maturin.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.638
- Is Dr. Thompson in there?
- Yes, he is.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.429
We'll hold the hypo for now.
She's doing all right.

55:22.640 --> 55:24.437
You're wanted, doctor.

55:26.920 --> 55:29.718
I'm Gray Maturin, doctor.
They sent for me.

55:31.320 --> 55:32.878
- How is she?
- She's conscious now.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.196
She asked about her husband.
Will you tell her?

55:35.400 --> 55:37.277
Tell her? Doesn't she know?

55:37.480 --> 55:39.914
She should be told before
a possible shock reaction.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.718
You're an old friend.

55:58.640 --> 56:02.758
Hello, Gray.
It was nice of you to come.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.474
I got here as quickly as I could.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.191
It was such a silly thing to happen.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.836
A bunch of drunks.
They ran into us at an intersection.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.076
We might all have been killed.

56:14.280 --> 56:17.511
It was lucky I was holding
the baby in my arms.

56:17.840 --> 56:21.594
Is the car badly damaged?
Where's Bob?

56:22.240 --> 56:24.310
Careful of her arm.

56:25.480 --> 56:27.277
Where's Bob?

56:27.480 --> 56:29.914
I want Bob. Bob?

56:30.080 --> 56:31.877
You have to stay in bed,
Mrs. MacDonald.

56:32.080 --> 56:34.640
- Take it easy, Sophie.
- No. I've got to see Bob.

56:34.840 --> 56:37.149
- And baby. Baby, baby.
- Don't let her get up.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.430
- I'll get the doctor.
- Sophie, lie down.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.235
- Leave me alone, you swine!
- Please. Please, Sophie.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.355
Is Bob dead, Gray?

56:50.240 --> 56:52.037
Is he dead?

56:53.280 --> 56:55.589
You can tell me, Gray.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.398
Yes.

57:09.040 --> 57:10.359
And...

57:12.400 --> 57:14.231
...baby too?

57:18.040 --> 57:19.871
Linda.

57:20.480 --> 57:23.040
Linda!

57:23.240 --> 57:25.515
Baby.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.798
Hypo.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.476
Linda. Wake up, baby.

57:45.680 --> 57:49.912
Wake up, baby, wake up.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.910
Well, are you ready to start
on your pilgrimage?

58:33.080 --> 58:34.399
Yes.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.909
But I'll miss it here.
I've been very happy.

58:37.120 --> 58:40.795
We'll miss you too. But you've
got all you can get from books.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.673
It's time for you to put the world
behind you for a while.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.115
To isolate yourself completely...

58:46.280 --> 58:48.191
...from everything.

58:51.640 --> 58:55.997
Sometimes very strange things
happen when you're in the mountains.

58:56.200 --> 58:59.397
Not a living soul within miles of you.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.279
Nothing above you but the sky...

59:02.480 --> 59:04.232
...and God.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.911
What sort of things?

59:08.080 --> 59:11.834
That, my son, depends on you.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.714
You'll find a little shelter up there
at the very top.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.791
Go in. Make yourself at home.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.437
After you've been there some time,
perhaps I shall pay you a visit.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.517
You've come.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.756
Let me look at you.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.078
Yes, I see.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.272
You were right.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.796
Something very strange
did happen to me.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.672
I know.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.632
Tell me.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:32.672
It was just at that moment
before night ends and day begins...

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.395
...when the whole world
seems to tremble in the balance.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.834
Gradually the light began
to filter through the darkness...

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.555
...like some mysterious figure
stealing through the trees.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.472
And then the first rays
of the sun came up.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.438
The mountains,
the mist caught in the treetops... .

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.913
I'd never before felt
or seen anything like it.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.949
I know. I come here often.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.435
I felt that I'd been released
from my body.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.234
That I was suspended in midair.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.990
That all the things
that had been confused before...

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.874
...suddenly became clear to me.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.916
I had a sense of knowledge
more than human.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.590
I felt that I'd broken away
and was free.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.757
I felt that if it lasted
another minute, l...

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.751
I'd die.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.109
And yet I was willing to die
if I could just hold onto it...

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.834
...because for that one moment...

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.554
...I had the feeling that... .

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.037
That you and God were one.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.517
Yes.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.434
I'm sure I could stay here forever
and never tire of it.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.397
No. You must go back.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.353
You are now ready to go back.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.354
It's not necessary
to leave the world, my son...

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:09.109
...but rather to live in the world
and to love the objects of the world...

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.996
...not for themselves alone,
but for what there is in them of God.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.953
Your place is with your own people.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.709
You, my son,
are one of the fortunate ones.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.959
By the grace of God, it's been given you
to see the infinite beauty of the world...

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.038
...which is only the reflection
seen through a glass darkly...

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.713
...of the beauty of God.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.476
That sense of joy...

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.989
...that vision of his beauty...

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.593
...will remain with you, fresh and vivid,
till the day of your death.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.237
This crest is not in the proper place
at all.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.389
The crest belongs up here.
Up here.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.120
I'm not running in the Olympic Games,
you know.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.874
It'll all have to be done over
immediately.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.874
Now, about this robe. It's really dreadful.
Dreadful.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.998
And look at this tassel. Hideous.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.674
It should strike me here, at the knees,
lower, lower...

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.990
...so that when I walk, it'll sway.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.277
As it is now, it just bobbles.
Where are my ties?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.757
It isn't.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.753
By Jove, it is.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.714
- My dear fellow.
- Elliott.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.314
- Where have you been all these years?
- In the Orient.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.550
The last time I passed through
you were away.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.951
Come in, come in.
I have a house on the Riviera now.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.350
I've reached an age
when I'm prepared to relax...

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.637
...and enjoy the beauties of nature.
- You surprise me, Elliott.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.872
You always looked on nature as
an impediment to social intercourse.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.439
Paris is not what it was.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.830
There's practically nobody to know
here anymore.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.076
But on the Riviera,
there's some nice people.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.028
In fact, the shores of the Mediterranean
are simply littered with royalties.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.556
Heavens knows I'm not a snob,
but just as a matter of interest...

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.840
...I don't mind telling you that on one
occasion I had two ex-kings to lunch.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.319
Two.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.198
How nice.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.192
Elliott, what the devil is that crown
doing over your initials?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.876
His Holiness has been graciously pleased
to revive in my favor my old family title.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.077
- Your what?
- Oh, didn't you know?

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.277
I'm descended in the female line
from the Count de Lauria...

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.558
...who came to England with Philip II and
married a maid of honor to Queen Mary.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.597
As an American citizen, I feel it
more modest not to use my title...

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.876
...except on all my personal linen.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.157
I think that's a very pretty gesture
on your part, Elliott.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.153
I take a modest pride
in concealing my rank...

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.756
...under the sober pinstripe
of an American gentleman.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.670
You know that Isabel and Gray Maturin
are here with their two children.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.832
Are they? I didn't know.
I've only just arrived in Paris.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.430
- They were wiped out in the crash.
- Yes, I heard that.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.110
Poor Isabel even had to sell
her jewels.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.317
Gray tried to get a job, but it appears
there was no business.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.232
The result was a nervous breakdown.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.153
And he suffers from
the most frightful headaches.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.470
He couldn't take a job now
if he could get one.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.914
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.719
I couldn't let them live like pigs,
Isabel with no maid...

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.598
...and no governess for the children.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.793
So I've lent them my apartment
until Gray is back on his feet.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.554
You're the most generous creature
in the world.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.792
Nonsense. If I'm taking care of them,
it's because...

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.916
...well, noblesse oblige, you know.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.799
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- What about having lunch with me?

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.748
- I'm expecting an old friend of yours.
- I wasn't aware I had old friends in Paris.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.912
And even if I have, nothing would give
me less pleasure...

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:54.390
...than to meet them at this time.
- Jump in. We're meeting at the Dome.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.755
I dislike being hustled.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.437
To the Dome.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.070
And what about you?
Were you hurt in the crash?

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.515
God tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.636
I happened to be in Rome
in September '29.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.758
My friends strongly advised me to sell
my American securities.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.069
I very sensibly took their advice.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.356
So when the crash came
you were sitting pretty.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.318
An Americanism, which I see
no occasion for you to use...

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:28.109
...but it expresses my situation
with a good deal of accuracy.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:30.270
In fact, I was inspired to sell short...

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.078
...and made what you would probably
call a killing.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.118
- You're a downy old bird, Elliott.
- I have a flair.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:48.676
I do not like the propinquity
of the hoi polloi.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.278
- Oh, hello.
- Larry.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:55.069
- Larry? I thought you were dead.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.879
- Where have you sprung from?
- India.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.314
India.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.029
If you will excuse me,
I will now leave you.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.111
I find I have an engagement.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:07.872
- Goodbye, my dear fellow.
- Goodbye.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.634
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.229
- Did you know Isabel and Gray are here?
- Really? Where are they staying?

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.470
In Elliot's apartment
with their children.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.959
I must look them up.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.997
If you don't want to drive their
two girls into hysterics...

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.357
...you'd better get a haircut.
- That'd be a good idea anyway.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.910
They've had a bad time. The Maturin
Company was wiped out in the crash.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.116
Gray had a nervous breakdown.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:51.477
Poor Gray. Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.234
What did you do in India?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.675
I learned something about myself.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.230
I was very happy there.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.952
- Mr. Maugham, sir.
- Yes, I know.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.439
- Hello, Mr. Maugham.
- Hello.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.511
Isabel said she talked to you
on the phone.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.432
Tell Mrs. Maturin
Mr. Maugham's here.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.795
I'm sorry to hear
you've been under the weather.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.430
It's one of those things that comes
and goes. I can't get rid of it.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.319
I thought if I came here
the change might do me good.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.072
Hello.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.355
- Mr. Maugham.
- Isabel.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.590
This is a pleasure.
How are the children?

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.479
Oh, wonderful.
Growing by leaps and bounds.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.110
- How is it now, dear?
- Oh, I'm all right.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.590
If you'll excuse me, I always feel
such a nuisance when I'm like this.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.910
Do you want anything, dear?

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.635
- No.
- Sure?

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.789
- Poor boy.
- What a pity. I was hoping you two...

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.794
...would dine with me tonight.
- Oh, I'd love to. But he really suffers.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.319
You look very well, Mr. Maugham.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.391
I am very well.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.356
Larry hasn't arrived yet?

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.439
Larry?

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.036
Yes, he lunched with me today. He said
he'd drop in on you this afternoon.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.555
Larry in Paris? Where has he been?

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.758
- India.
- But I didn't know.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.990
I didn't know he'd been in India.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.715
Do you realize I haven't laid eyes
on him for years?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.194
Did you tell him we'd lost
all our money?

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.035
It's funny when you think of it,
that we have...

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.034
...almost exactly the income that Larry
had when he wanted me to marry him.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.119
And I wouldn't, because
we couldn't possibly live on it.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.478
And now I have two children besides.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.072
I don't think you're so terribly
to be pitied.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.711
Excuse me.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.837
Mr. Darrell.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.398
Isabel.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.353
Larry.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.670
Hello, Isabel.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.872
Larry.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.470
Oh, Larry, I can't believe it.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.200
- Where did they go?
- Who?

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.549
Oh, the brood. Come on, babies.
Come on, darling. Come back.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.469
- Oh, come here. What's your name?
- Joan.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.029
- Joan. And how old are you?
- Seven.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.599
Seven.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.951
This is Priscilla.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.916
Seven. It has been a long time.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.273
Yes. A long time.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.471
- It's a lovely brood. Where's Gray?
- In the library.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.631
Run along, darlings.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.713
- Hello, Larry.
- Hello.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.711
Come in and see Gray.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.510
Gray, look who's here.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.713
- Hello, Gray. Don't get up.
- Larry. I am glad to see you.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.552
Sorry you caught me like this.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.438
- Blinding headache.
- Yes.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.068
Mr. Maugham wants to take us
all out this evening.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.913
I thought we'd dine and do the town.
Do you feel up to it?

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.595
Well, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Maugham, but I'm afraid not.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.554
- Larry'll go, won't you, Larry?
- Oh, poor Gray.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.109
Sail on, all of you.
Don't let me spoil your evening.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.068
Wait a minute. Would you let me see
if I can help you?

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.108
- How?
- I mean, I... .

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.999
I might be able to help you
help yourself.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.073
All right.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.708
Here, sit down.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.348
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.916
What's this?

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.237
It's an old coin from India.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.958
Here.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:21.035
Close your fingers tightly on this,
palm downward.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.478
Now don't fight me.
Don't make any effort.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.438
Just squeeze the coin
with your closed fist.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.311
Before I count 10...

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.278
...your hand will open,
and the coin will drop out of it.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.913
One, two...

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.753
...three, four...

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.072
...five, six...

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.471
...seven...

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.399
...eight, nine... .

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.674
I didn't let that coin drop.
It fell out of itself.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.072
It's not important.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.674
I just thought it might give you
confidence in me.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.637
Why?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.154
You'll see. Here.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.992
Got it?

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.109
- Excuse me. Here.
- What do you want me to do?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.319
Come back in the corner and sit right
against those cushions. Get comfortable.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.597
- Are you comfortable?
- I think so.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.069
- Have you got a watch?
- Yes.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.229
Palm downward.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.311
Thank you.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.755
Six forty-three.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.633
In 60 seconds, your eyelids
will grow heavy...

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.553
...so heavy that you will be
obliged to close them.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:45.995
Then you will sleep for another minute.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.989
At 6:45, you will wake up...

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.515
...and you will have no more pain.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.395
No more pain.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.151
Believe it or not, he's falling asleep.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.392
- You learned that in India.
- There's nothing miraculous about it.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.950
I merely put an idea into his head.
He's doing the rest himself.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.233
I did doze off.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.197
Is your head better?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.352
I don't know. Could be.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.391
- You did something. What did you do?
- I didn't do it. You did it yourself.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.835
- Did I?
- Of course.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.436
A moment ago, my head was splitting
wide open, from here to here.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.909
- How is it now?
- Well, it's certainly better.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.638
Could you cure him permanently?

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.997
I can't do miracles, but there's no reason
why he can't cure himself.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.789
- But that was a miracle. I saw it.
- Well, whatever it was, it sure helped.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.713
- Enough to come to dinner with us?
- Sure, I'd like to come.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.996
- I haven't eaten all day.
- You'll come, Larry.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.993
I'd love to. You know, I haven't danced
with you for years.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:36.836
- I'd like to find out if I still know how.
- We'll see. I'll go get my things.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.948
Oh, would you like a drink,
Mr. Maugham? Larry?

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.076
Everything's here.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.833
Oh, hello. How is your friend,
Elliott Templeton?

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.116
Pretty well, I think.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.439
- Who was that?
- The Princess Novemali.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.873
Edna.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.153
Funny fellow, that Larry.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.029
He doesn't look a day older than he did
when he left all those years ago.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.430
India changed him.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.592
- Changed him?
- He looks extraordinarily happy to me.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.957
Calm, yet strangely aloof.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.554
- Excuse me. Do you have a match?
- Oh, here.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.029
- Did you get the car?
- Not yet.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.313
Thanks.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.995
- Does he dance as well as ever?
- I didn't notice.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.956
You aren't going to be so silly as
to fall in love with him again, are you?

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.557
I've never stopped loving him.
I've never loved anyone else in my life.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.192
Marriage is a pretty difficult job,
even when one's in love.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.555
I shouldn't have thought it fun
when one is not.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.149
One can get on all right without love.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.868
Gray's such a good fellow.
Be a pity to hurt him.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.715
I'll never do anything to hurt him.
I'm too fond of him for that.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.235
Well, it's your business, not mine.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.551
Where to now?
How about Les Ambassadeurs?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.792
Oh, no, I'm sick of all these
smart places.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.192
Well?

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.114
How about the rue de Lappe?
I've never been there.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.679
At least it will be different.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.071
- The rue de Lappe in those clothes?
- Nonsense. I can keep my jacket on.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.959
- Please. It'll be fun.
- Don't blame us if you don't like it.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.192
Pull down the blinds if you don't want
a bottle through the window.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.999
You asked for it, Isabel. Here it is.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.954
I'm not scared. I like it.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.837
Oh, look at that.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.754
The police will probably choose now
to raid the place.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.115
I should be thrilled to the marrow.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.432
- Any champagne in Paris is all right.
- Well, I don't...

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.509
- Well, well, look who's here.
- Sophie.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.797
Who'd you think it was?

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.872
Sit down. Sit down, all of you.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.238
Hello, Gray. Sit down.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.958
I'll get you a chair, Sophie.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.758
Fancy meeting you all like this.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.477
- Hello, Larry.
- Hi, brown eyes.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.752
How are you?

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.797
Thirsty.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.750
Come on, let's all have a drink.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.314
Do I know them?
They're my childhood friends.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.355
Who says I'm drunk?

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.031
I know you.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.350
You came to Chicago.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.708
- Bit of a stuffed shirt, aren't you?
- Maybe.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.393
I can't say you seem
so terribly pleased to see me.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.278
I heard you were in Paris, Sophie.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.351
You might've called.
I'm in the phone book.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.954
- Are you?
- Yes.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.160
Having a good time over here, Sophie?

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.436
Fine.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.879
You went bust, didn't you, Gray?

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.915
Tough on you.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.110
I guess it must be pretty grim
in Chicago right now.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.078
Lucky for me I got out when I did.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.317
Where are those drinks?

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.992
Here they are, Sophie.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.676
Here you are, Sophie.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.835
My loving in-laws kicked me out
of Chicago.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.673
Said I was gumming up
their reputation.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.791
Look out, Coco. He's the quiet type.
He'll lay you out cold.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.435
- Is that a friend of yours, Sophie?
- Yes, that's a friend of mine, Isabel.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.319
- You living in Paris now, Larry?
- Yes, I am, Sophie.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.951
You remember the summer
before the war?

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.394
Sure.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.870
- We saw a lot of each other then.
- When?

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.080
When you and your mother
were being social.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.275
We used to read poetry together.
Remember, Larry?

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.558
You used to write some poetry
yourself in those days.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.314
Pretty good too, wasn't it?

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.673
Not bad for a kid.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.156
It was good.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.320
Well, I'd better get back
to my boyfriend...

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.630
...or he'll raise the roof.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.955
He's a sulky brute.
But quite a man.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.034
Come and see me
when you've nothing better to do.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.829
I've got a case of Scotch.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.276
So long, folks.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.237
Come again.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.751
I'm here every night.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.716
I'm afraid that was not
a great success.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.714
Some shock to see Sophie.
Boy, was she tight.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.475
- Lf not worse.
- That's funny. I got the same impression.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.359
- Do you remember her at all?
- Very well. I liked her.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.192
I remember her husband.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.669
You never saw two people
so crazy about each other.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.990
They got to be a regular joke
around Chicago.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.230
- But what happened?
- Didn't you know?

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.909
Bob and the baby were killed.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.758
A car hit them.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.238
- Oh, so that's what it is.
- She nearly went crazy.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.595
We did all we could to help,
but it was no good.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.673
If you asked her to dinner,
she'd come in plastered and pass out.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.189
- We simply had to drop her.
- She became impossible.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.954
Of course, it was a shock.
I was terribly sorry for her.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.599
But a normal person recovers.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.228
If she went to pieces, it was because
she was always unbalanced.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.551
Even her love for Bob was exaggerated.
Aren't I right, Larry?

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.755
No, I don't agree with you, Isabel.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.798
She was as normal as any person
I've ever known.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.473
But remember, I knew her better
than you did.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.190
- Was she in love with you?
- Good heavens, no.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.591
She was only a kid.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.149
Just a skinny little girl
with a bow in her hair.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.350
I remember her crying once
when I was reading an ode of Keats'...

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.198
...because it was so beautiful.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.319
Girls of that age are very emotional.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.794
Oh, there was a lot to her
in those days.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.237
She had what Keats probably
would have called...

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.595
...a sort of lovely purity.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.270
Chauffeur, would you stop
at the next corner.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.433
- You're not going to run out on us.
- Well, my hotel's only a step from here.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.268
- Good night.
- Larry, will we see you?

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.675
- Yes.
- We're going to Vittel on Thursday...

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.956
...with Elliott.
He wants to take the cure.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.315
We'll be back by the first.
I'll call you.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.432
Fine. Well, good night.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.431
- Good night, Gray.
- Good night, Larry.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.318
And thanks for the dinner.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.714
- Hello?
- Larry.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.873
At last. I've been trying to reach you
for hours. Aren't you ever in?

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.079
Well, hardly ever.
When did you get back?

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.395
This morning.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.836
Uncle Elliott insisted on being here
in time for Elsa's soiree tonight.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.754
Poor dear. He's not at all well,
but he will go to all these parties.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.033
How's Gray getting along?

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.118
Oh, Larry, you've simply done
wonders for him.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:41.512
He's started to play golf again.
He blames it all on you.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.999
And what have you been doing?

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.791
Oh, one thing and another.
I've seen a lot of Sophie.

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.553
Really? Why?

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.198
Well, after all, she's an old friend.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.039
If you want my opinion,
I think you're wasting your time.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.390
She stopped drinking.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.279
Larry, you're the most gullible person
I've ever known.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.192
She'll never stop drinking.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.635
Sophie wallows in the gutter
because she likes it.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.631
A blind person could see that.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.877
Well, just the same, I do wish
you'd be nice to her, Isabel.

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.473
We're going to be married.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.077
What?

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.354
Married?

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.756
Yes, that's right. It's all settled.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.078
Well, you're not serious. You can't be.

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.191
But I am.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.190
Well, aren't you going
to congratulate me?

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:33.388
I am not. I think you're... You're...

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:52.111
- What's kept you? You've been hours.
- I came the instant I got your call.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.748
- What's happened?
- It's about Larry and Sophie.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.878
The idiot. The stupid, blind idiot.
He must be mad.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.112
If you'd calm down, I might be able
to make out what you're saying.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.555
He's going to marry her.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.797
- How do you know?
- He just called me on the phone.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.632
- Oh, I'm frantic.
- So I see.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.155
He had the effrontery to ask me
to be nice to her.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.357
- Well, it's his own affair, isn't it?
- She's an awful woman.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.557
She's bad, bad, bad!

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.873
She's soused from morning
till night.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.312
That doesn't mean she's bad.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.155
Quite a number of respectable citizens
get drunk and do silly things.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.029
They're bad habits, but I don't know
if they're worse than that.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:37.875
I call a person bad who lies and cheats
and is unkind.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.270
If you're going to take her part,
I'll kill you.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.398
- I'd prefer if you'd give me a cup of tea.
- Oh, help yourself.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.994
He's seen a lot of her since we were
at that dive.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:50.073
He says she's quit drinking.
The fool thinks he's cured her.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.596
- Did you forget what he did for Gray?
- That had nothing to do with it.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.755
Thanks. Gray wanted to be cured.
She doesn't.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:00.069
- How do you know?
- Because I know women.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.119
Do you think she'll stick to Larry? No.
She'll break out. It's in her blood.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.511
It's a brute she wants. That excites her.
It's a brute she'll go after.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.352
She'll lead Larry to hell.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.394
It's probable, but I don't see
what you can do about it.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.030
I can do nothing about it.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.391
But you can.

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.517
I?

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.554
Larry likes you, and he listens
to what you say.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.235
You know the world. Go to him and
tell him he can't make a fool of himself.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.515
Tell him it'll ruin him.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.070
He'd only tell me it's none of
my business, and he'd be quite right.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.549
It may not turn out so badly
as you think.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.315
You make me tired!
She's rotten to the core!

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.752
Do you think I've sacrificed myself...

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.832
...only to let Larry fall into the hands
of a woman like that?

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.431
How did you sacrifice yourself?

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.434
I gave up Larry for one reason only.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.989
Because I didn't want to stand
in his way.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.434
Come off it, Isabel.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.434
You gave him up for
a square-cut diamond and a sable coat.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.629
Your Uncle Elliott wouldn't
have thanked you...

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.268
...if you'd broken one of his
Crown Darby plates.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.715
They were made for the Duchess
of Dorset.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.031
- Pick up that bread and butter.
- Pick it up yourself.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.509
And you call yourself
an English gentleman.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.830
No, that's one thing I've never done.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.436
Get out of here! I never want to see
you again. I hate the sight of you.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:25.992
I'm sorry for that, because the sight
of you always gives me pleasure.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.678
Have you ever been told your nose
is like that of the Psyche...

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.592
...in the Muzeum of Naples?

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:40.276
And that's the loveliest representation
of virginal beauty that ever existed.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.116
You've got exquisite legs,
so long and shapely.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.108
I can't cease to be surprised at them.
They were lumpy when I first saw you.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:52.876
- I can't imagine how you've managed it.
- An iron will.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.672
But, of course, your most
fascinating feature...

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:02.037
...are your hands.
They're so slim and elegant.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.839
I was under the impression
you thought them too big.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.150
Not for your height and build.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.799
I'm always amazed at the infinite grace
with which you use them.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.475
Whether by nature or by art...

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.837
...you never make a gesture
without imparting beauty to it.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.549
They're like flowers sometimes...

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.678
...and sometimes like birds
on the wing.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.071
There are moments
when I don't positively dislike you.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.356
Sometimes I think you're rather sweet.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.318
I will not have my face
smeared with lipstick.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.913
If you want to kiss me,
kiss me on the lips...

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.311
...which is what a merciful providence
provided them for.

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.359
Thank you.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.512
- Now what's it you want?
- Advice.

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.832
There's only one thing you can do.
Make the best of a bad job.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.516
Larry's gripped
by the most powerful emotion...

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.990
...that can beset the breast of man,
self-sacrifice.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.515
He's got to save the soul
of the wretched woman...

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.955
...whom he had known
as an innocent child.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:04.550
And there's nothing you or I
or anyone can do to prevent it.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.439
But he's going to be so unhappy.

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.151
Do you love him very much?

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.876
It is a nuisance, isn't it?

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.559
But I can't help it.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.711
And you don't want
to lose him altogether?

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.031
Then make friends with Sophie.
Be as nice to her as you can.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.997
Ask her to lunch.

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.431
It would be rather awkward for me
after what I've just said to Larry.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.637
- Will you behave if I do?
- Like an angel of light.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.472
I'll fix it up.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.559
One o'clock tomorrow at the Ritz.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.196
What are you thinking?
I don't quite like the look of you.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.477
I'm sorry. I thought that was
the one thing about me you did like.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.234
You haven't got some scheme
you've been hatching up?

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.753
Oh, I promise you I haven't.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.275
I'm terribly curious
to see what she looks like...

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.715
...now that Larry's reformed her.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.711
- Larry.
- Oh, there you are.

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.916
Excuse me. Mr. Maugham's table?

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.389
- In the lounge, monsieur.
- Thank you.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.912
Larry. You like it?

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.400
You look fine, come on.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.234
- Hello, Larry.
- Miss Keith.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.311
- How do you do?
- Nice to see you.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.835
- Hello, Sophie.
- Oh, hello, Isabel.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.956
- Sophie, I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.714
- Hello, Larry. Here they are.
- Thank you for asking us.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.233
- Hello, Gray.
- Hello, Larry.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.472
- Isabel says you're feeling much better.
- Not better, I feel great.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.359
I haven't taken a sleeping pill
since we went out together.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.750
If you ever hang out your shingle,
let me know.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.717
- I'll do that.
- Oh, a cocktail.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.757
- No, thank you.
- Here.

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.876
- No, thanks.
- You don't mind if we do?

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.793
- Oh, no, of course not.
- Go right ahead.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.190
Oh, look. Uncle Elliott.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.238
He behaves exactly as if the Ritz
were his private house.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.029
I'm sure he's telling them how pleased
he is they accepted his invitation.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.838
I'd rather not discuss it.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.718
Isabel. That bloody woman.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.269
How do you do?
It's charming to see you again.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.159
May I offer you my best wishes?
I hope you'll be very happy.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.833
Thank you.

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.559
- The same to you.
- Thank you.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.073
Cocktail, Elliott?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.596
No, I would not like a cocktail.
I drink nothing but Vichy.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.639
Look at her. You all know her, of course.
The Princess Edna Novemali.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.392
You'd never think she was American.

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.632
But I knew her before she came
over here from Milwaukee.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.509
And that frustrated old-maid secretary
of hers, if you ask me...

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.878
...they look like a couple of fugitives
from Madame Tussauïs waxworks.

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.995
And where will you and Larry
go on your honeymoon, my dear?

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.151
Greece, isn't it?

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.232
- Greece?
- It ought to be lovely this time of year.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.516
- Lovely.
- How about a liqueur, Gray?

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.877
- Yes, I think I will.
- Ah, yes, this.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.152
Sophie?

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.471
- No, thanks.
- You're very foolish. It's excellent.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.637
No, Uncle Elliott, she doesn't want it.

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.109
- Gray?
- A little glass for monsieur?

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.829
No, alas, it's forbidden me.
My doctors won't let me touch alcohol.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.912
A tear of Perzovka
can do monsieur no harm.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.950
Perzovka. Perzovka.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.517
I'll just have a look at the bottle.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.794
I'm sorry to hear you've been ill, Elliott.
You should take care of yourself.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.876
Perzovka.

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:38.116
It can't hurt me for once.
Just a drop.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.396
Two drops, perhaps.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.038
We drank it at the Radziwills when
I stayed with them for the shooting.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.556
You should have seen
those Polish princes putting it away.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.280
They drink it by the tumbler
and never turn a hair.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.275
I don't care whether Sophie's
on the wagon or not, she must try this.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.998
It's an experience no one can miss.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.436
It's like listening to music
by moonlight.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.312
I'd rather not.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.958
Isabel?

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.596
Nice smell.

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.472
That's the herbs they put in it.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.118
Oh, very good. Can we have some
of this at the apartment?

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.078
Certainly. I'll have a few bottles
sent around.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.231
What did you say it was like,
Uncle Elliott?

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:32.233
Like listening to music by moonlight.

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.193
It is.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.919
Sophie.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.796
- Yes?
- I saw the most divine wedding dress...

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.793
...at Molyneux's. Let me give it to you
for a wedding present.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.678
- Uncle Elliott and me.
- What?

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.912
- Sophie has one already picked out.
- Oh, don't be stuffy, Larry.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.435
Let us give her a dress.
I'll arrange a fitting.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.033
May she?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.998
- Certainly. It's very nice of you.
- Thank you, both of you.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.593
Not at all, not at all.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.228
Suppose you pick me up tomorrow
at 3 at the apartment?

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.391
- You know the address, don't you?
- Yes.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.678
Oh, good heavens, we don't want you.
You're only the groom.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.718
I'll see you at 3.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.036
Yes, it was a lovely party.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.153
No, of course I did.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.630
I behaved like an angel.
I always do.

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.317
Oh, how silly.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.550
Stop imagining things.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.750
I meant every word of it.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.718
Yes.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.359
Yes.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.357
Tomorrow. At 5.

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:46.276
That was Somerset Maugham
on the telephone.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.078
He gives me the queerest feeling.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.708
As if he were leading
other people's lives for them.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.599
But I daresay that comes
of being a novelist.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.958
Here.

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.472
Thanks.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.156
Mr. Maugham.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.350
I called him a stuffed shirt that night.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.751
What does it matter?
That's all past. You weren't yourself.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.476
Your mind was miles away when
I came in. Where was it? With Larry?

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.837
- No, right here. I was thinking.
- What?

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.072
- You always wanted Larry for yourself.
- I've always wanted to see him happy.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.950
You hate me for marrying him,
don't you?

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.113
No. I don't hate you at all.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.556
I'd hate anyone or anything
that came in the way of his happiness.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.754
- I'll be a good wife.
- I hope you will.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.078
I was before.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.471
I know you were.
Sophie, don't misunderstand me.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.438
I don't.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.520
What are we getting into?
Coffee? Ice?

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.352
No, thanks.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.431
I'm going to have a drink.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.030
Oh, look. Uncle Elliott sent the Perzovka.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.156
- The what?
- Don't you remember?

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.151
He raved about it yesterday.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.472
Oh, yes, the Perzovka.

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.552
Poor Uncle Elliott.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.396
Exaggerates about so many things,
but for once, he's right.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.799
I love the color.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.714
Like the green you sometimes see
in the heart of a white rose.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.599
Poor Sophie.

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.990
I haven't had a drink since that night
in the rue de Lappe.

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.432
It must be awful just to break off
completely, all at once.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.637
Sometimes when I've been alone...

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.473
...I've wanted to shake
the house down.

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.876
But I've quit.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.473
- Yesterday at the Ritz was tough going.
- I know, I saw it.

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.551
Did you? Did I show it?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.548
Only to me, I think.
It meant something to me.

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.191
Larry, you mean. Larry's happiness.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.312
He's good.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.835
He's really good, Isabel.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.310
I was gone. Lost. Gone.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.274
This is my only chance. I know that.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.874
Excuse me.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.190
- Is the car here?
- Yes, madame.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.956
Could we talk more?

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.998
- Of course, as much as you want.
- Will you wait for me?

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:41.709
I've got to pick up Joan
at the dentist's. I promised I would.

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.877
Your baby.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.317
- How old is she now?
- Seven.

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.872
Here.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.596
She's lovely.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.513
Linda would have been 9
in November.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.320
This November that's coming.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.472
Stay here. I'll be back
and we can talk.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.030
If you see Sophie MacDonald,
the American, tell her I'll be back later.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.030
Hi, big boy.

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.760
Please pass me some Perzovka.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.359
Where's that?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.197
- I speak the English from London.
- Very well, come along.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.029
It is better I do not go in, monsieur.
I will wait for you there.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.437
Come on, Sophie.

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.591
Let's get out of here.

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.155
Hello, Larry.

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.509
Come on. Join us.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.755
Perzovka.

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.677
You must try some.

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.070
It smells like... .

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:19.550
Like listening to music by moonlight.

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.599
Come along, Sophie. Up you go. Up.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.477
Come on, Sophie.

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.317
Come with me now.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.994
I'll buy you a drink someplace else.

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.792
Take your hands off me!

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:55.192
I don't need you! I don't need anyone!

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:06.676
<i>That was the very last I saw or heard</i>
<i>of Sophie MacDonald for almost a year. </i>

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.909
<i>As a matter of record, it was</i>
<i>the very last any of us knew of her. </i>

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.870
<i>I settled down at my cottage</i>
<i>on the Riviera... </i>

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:16.270
<i>... near Cap Ferrat to finish my book. </i>

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.268
<i>And then one day, the police of Toulon</i>
<i>sent for me. </i>

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.030
Good morning, Monsieur Maugham.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.634
I see Monsieur Maugham
wears the <i>Légion ïHonneur. </i>

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.519
- I have that distinction.
- I apologize for being obliged...

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:45.433
...to inconvenience a person
of your distinction.

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.512
Nothing could make me happier
than being of service to you.

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:50.671
Now, about this.

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:53.999
Yes. This is a very dirty business,
monsieur.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:58.472
It appears that the woman, Sophie
MacDonald, had a very evil reputation.

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:00.915
She was brutally murdered.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.753
What?

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:05.709
Her body was fished out of the harbor.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:08.713
Her throat was cut from ear to ear.

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.279
Dreadful.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.353
How does it happen that a person
of your age...

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.830
...and respectability should be
acquainted with such a character?

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.709
- I knew her very slightly.
- This volume was found in her room.

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.589
If you will examine the autographed
page, you will see it hardly suggests...

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:34.116
...that your acquaintance with her
was as slight as you claim.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:40.797
"My sweet, let us see if the rose... . "

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:43.516
If you think I was her lover,
you're wrong.

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.079
It would be no affair of mine.

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.754
And without wishing to say
anything offensive to you...

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.959
...I must add that from what I've heard
of her proclivities...

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:53.917
...I should say you were not her type.

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.036
I'm prepared to take that
as a compliment.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:59.795
Nevertheless, it is evident you
would not address a perfect stranger...

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.155
...as "my sweet. "

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:07.509
That line, <i>monsieur le commissaire</i>, is the
first of a celebrated poem by Ronsard...

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:11.599
...with whose works I am certain a man
of your education must be familiar.

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:16.436
Ronsard, Ronsard. Oh, Ronsard.

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:21.989
Of course, I studied Ronsard at school.
But with all the work I have to do...

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.594
...I must confess that line
has escaped my memory.

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.436
As a matter of fact, I signed this book
for her years ago in Chicago.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.919
Hello, Mr. Maugham.

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.833
I didn't know you were here.
I thought you were in Sanary.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.150
Yeah, they sent for me.
Have they told you?

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.595
- It's dreadful.
- I've just seen her at the morgue.

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.352
I had to identify her.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.080
<i>Pardon, </i> Monsieur Maugham,
do you know this individual?

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.313
I do. He's an American citizen.
His name is Lawrence Darrell.

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.631
And what do you know of
Monsieur Lawrence Darrell?

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:53.678
He's a student,
a young man of impeccable character.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.353
Impeccable, eh?

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.830
And how long have you known this
young man of impeccable character?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.195
Approximately 10 years.

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.077
Have any burial arrangements
been made?

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:08.074
Well, if you are prepared to undertake
the expense of the funeral yourself...

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.435
...you will receive
the necessary authorization.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.518
Here is a card of an undertaker,
a personal friend of mine...

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:17.956
...who will arrange the matter for you
on terms and with dispatch.

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:22.033
- You are a marvel of efficiency.
- You flatter me <i>beaucoup</i>.

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:23.792
May I see where she lived?

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.554
- You have not seen that room before?
- No, I have not.

01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:58.438
Look.

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.472
Who are these people?

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:04.677
- That's her husband. That's her baby.
- Where are they now?

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.115
Dead, monsieur. A long time ago.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.955
May those be buried with her?

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:13.714
- In that frame, monsieur?
- Yes.

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.950
As you wish, monsieur.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.631
This is the ode of Keats' I read to her
when she was a little girl.

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.236
I remember you mentioned it in the car,
on the way from the rue de Lappe.

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.159
It's something
I've always remembered her by.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.673
<i>The day is gone</i>
<i>And all its sweets are gone! </i>

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.628
<i>Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand</i>
<i>And softer breast</i>

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.678
<i>Warm breath, light whisper</i>
<i>Tender semitone</i>

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.431
<i>Bright eyes, accomplished shape</i>
<i>And languorous waist! </i>

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.391
<i>Faded the flower</i>
<i>And all its budded charms</i>

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.438
<i>Faded the sight of beauty</i>
<i>From my eyes</i>

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:03.794
<i>Faded the shape of beauty</i>
<i>From my arms</i>

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.870
<i>Faded the voice, warmth</i>
<i>Whiteness, paradise</i>

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.350
<i>Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve</i>

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:25.350
My advice is that you go
and have a good dinner.

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:28.273
I have a card here
of one of the best restaurants in Toulon.

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.590
It will assure you
of the patron's attention.

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.309
A bottle of wine will do you both good
after this harrowing experience.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.597
I've got to get to Nice.
Elliott Templeton's had a relapse.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.035
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do Gray and Isabel know?

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.031
Yes, I hope they'll arrive in time.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.031
- I wish you'd come.
- I'd like to...

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.272
...but I was never one of Elliot's
favorites, if you remember.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.268
- Thank you. Good afternoon, Joseph.
- Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.396
I'll let Mr. Templeton know
you're here.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.710
- How is he?
- Very weak, sir.

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.030
The doctors say there's no hope.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.316
May I speak to you
on a very delicate matter?

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.835
- Of course.
- The time is growing short...

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.673
...and Mr. Templeton
should receive the last sacraments.

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.196
I hesitate to mention it to him,
sir, but perhaps...

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.828
- I shall be glad to suggest it.
- Thank you, sir.

01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:40.430
I hear voices.

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.836
See who it is.

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.235
Mr. Maugham, Mr. Darrell.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.278
My dear fellow,
how very nice to see you.

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.912
And Larry. Well, this is a surprise.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.799
- Mr. Maugham said you were sick.
- Did he?

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:04.110
- Well, I am sick.
- But you don't look it.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.316
You look extremely well.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:09.913
Well, really now,
young Mr. Larry Darrell...

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.117
...that's the most sensible thing
I've ever heard you say.

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:15.318
Of course he's right.

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.199
It's only a temporary indisposition.

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.712
I'm lunching with
a duke on Sunday...

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.714
...and I've told my doctor he must
put me to rights by then at all costs.

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.678
It's too bad this should
have happened just now.

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:30.229
It's a particularly brilliant season.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.954
Are you going to Edna Novemali's party?

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.429
- Of course not.
- Has she asked you?

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:39.477
She's asked everybody in Europe.

01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.710
She's giving a great do. Fancy dress.

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.157
Fancy dress.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.120
She hasn't asked me.
It's a deliberate insult.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.794
Don't be ridiculous.
Why should she want to insult you?

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:53.953
- It was just an oversight.
- I'm not a man that people overlook.

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.630
Perhaps she doesn't know
you're in the south of France.

01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.110
Don't be ridiculous, Larry. Everybody
knows I'm in the south of France.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.191
It'll be the best party of the season.

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.755
If I was on my deathbed, I'd go to it.

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:08.879
Never mind, old boy, it may rain
the night of the party. That'll ruin it.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.514
I never thought of that.

02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:19.990
I'll pray for rain
as I've never prayed before.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.913
The old witch.

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:26.838
She'd never have got anywhere
if it hadn't been for me.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.834
Now she doesn't invite me
to the greatest party of her career.

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.869
Fireworks, my dear fellow.
There are going to be fireworks.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:38.399
So unkind.

02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:41.837
I hate them, I hate them all.

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:45.074
They've eaten my food
and drunk my wine.

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:48.949
I've run their errands for them.
I've made their parties for them.

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.511
And what have I got out of it?
Nothing.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.356
Now that I'm old and sick...

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.316
...they have no use for me.

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.155
They don't care whether I live or die.
Not one of them.

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.636
They're so cruel.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.878
I wish I'd never left America.

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.717
Excuse me.

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:28.872
I'm afraid you're very ill, Elliott.
Much iller than you think.

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.508
I was wondering if you'd like
to see a priest.

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:33.557
Do you mean to say I'm going to die?

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.030
Oh, I hope not, but it's as well
to be on the safe side.

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.997
I understand.

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.668
Don't be upset, my dear fellow.

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:45.879
Noblesse oblige, you know.

02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:49.910
You... You ridiculous creature, Elliott.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.870
Call the bishop. Tell him I'd appreciate
it if he'd send Father Charles.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.359
He's a friend of mine.

02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.353
- I'll go and do that now.
- Thank you.

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.870
- May I borrow your car a few moments?
- Of course.

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:10.758
I'll go to Princess Novemali's house.

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.831
Her secretary's an old Scotch girl
I know.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.195
I think I can do something
about the invitation.

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.158
She's a spiteful woman.
There'll be 1000 people at her party.

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.470
It couldn't have hurt her
to have asked him.

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:23.438
- Leave that to me.
- Don't worry about the bags, darling.

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.478
- Mr. Maugham. Larry.
- Hello.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.915
This is a surprise.
I had no idea you were here.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.479
- Hello, Gray.
- How is he?

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.279
- I'm afraid you've come just in time.
- Poor Uncle Elliott.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:36.989
- I think he'd like to see you. Come on.
- Larry, you're not leaving?

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.071
I'll be right back.

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.350
It's more usual
to come in by the door, Larry.

02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.351
Hello. I thought the room was empty.

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:13.353
Then may I inquire
what you're doing here?

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.753
- I'm a burglar, dear.
- Fancy that, now.

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.151
And I thought for one happy moment
that you'd come here to attack me.

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.233
No, Miss Keith. No, I came to steal
a card for the princess's party.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.039
- She hasn't asked Elliott Templeton.
- I know she hasn't.

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.395
She crossed his name off
on the list herself.

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:31.198
He's awfully hurt at being left out.

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:33.032
If he wanted to keep in with her...

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.909
...he shouldn't have said those terrible
things about her and her chauffeur.

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.992
The unfortunate part about it is
that they're all true.

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.039
- You have nothing against him.
- No. He's always been very nice to me.

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:46.475
He's a gentleman.
That's more than you can say...

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.838
...about most people who come here to
fill their bellies at the princess's expense.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.755
Oh, come, Miss Keith, be a good sport.
Give me a card. He won't come.

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.117
He's dying, and it'll make
the poor old man so happy.

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.513
The cards are on the desk.

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:09.116
I am going to look out of the window
to observe the beauty of the prospect.

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:11.430
And what happens
when my back is turned...

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.990
...neither God nor man
can hold me responsible for.

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.313
Thank you, Miss Keith.

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:51.669
Our poor friend is very low.

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.432
He was a good man.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.559
His defects were on the surface,
but he was generous of heart...

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:00.188
...and kindly toward his fellow creatures.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.715
You may go in now.

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:17.556
A great honor, my dears.

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.472
I shall enter the kingdom of heaven...

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.552
...with a letter of introduction
from a prince of the church.

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.109
I fancy all doors will be open to me.

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.999
- You'll find the company very mixed.
- Don't you believe it.

02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:31.277
There will be none of this
confounded democracy there.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.954
I shall pick and choose my company
as I always have.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:39.592
No, no, please don't draw the curtains.
I always love this time of afternoon.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:41.432
Have a drink, my dear fellow.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.239
- You always have a drink at this time.
- I have had it.

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:47.392
Have you? Isabel,
if you are going to make a scene...

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:49.869
...you will have to leave the room.

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.918
I'm a rich man in my way,
and I've left you everything I have.

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:56.868
- Oh, Uncle Elliott.
- Now, now, now. Gray, come here.

02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:01.190
I understand you have a job in prospect.

02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.830
Yes. A roommate of mine in college
has offered me a job in his business.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.039
My idea is to see if I can raise enough
money to start up my father's firm again.

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:12.715
- It's still in receiver's hands.
- Splendid.

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.437
You have the money now, my boy.

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.196
Letter for Mr. Templeton.
It's marked urgent.

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:24.715
Joseph, you'd better stay.

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.476
- Elliott.
- What is it?

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:34.312
For you.

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:36.312
Open it.

02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:43.598
- What is it?
- It's a card for Edna Novemali's party.

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:50.110
There, what did I tell you?

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.996
Get a pad and envelope.

02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:56.393
- I'll reply.
- Please, don't bother about that now.

02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.120
Why not? I've always been
a man of the world.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:02.397
There's no reason why I should forget
my manners as I'm leaving it.

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.869
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Elliott.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:09.998
Mr. Elliott Templeton regrets...

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.914
...he cannot accept...

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:18.232
...Princess Novemali's kind invitation...

02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:21.432
...owing...

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:25.389
...to a previous engagement...

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:30.599
...with his blessed Lord.

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:34.753
The old witch.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.230
Pardon, madame,
but Mr. Darrell wishes to know...

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.312
...if the chauffeur might drive him
to the station.

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:57.232
- The station? He's leaving?
- Yes, madame, at 10:30 for Paris.

02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:59.675
But he didn't say.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.872
Yes. Yes, of course.

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.038
Leaving?

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:16.074
- He's going to America.
- Oh, really?

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.514
How wonderful.

02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:21.389
He's going to work his way back
on a tramp steamer.

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.030
He would do that.
But it doesn't matter.

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.078
At least he'll be home. I'll see him.

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:31.278
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:33.357
But you're not me.

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:37.149
All my life, I've done the things
other people have wanted me to do.

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:41.029
From now on, I intend to do the things
I want to do.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.794
I intend to see as much of Larry
as I possibly can.

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:49.592
- It may cause you a lot of pain, my dear.
- I know, but it's a pain that's heaven.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.828
Oh, Joseph. Tell Marcel
not to bother about the Rolls.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.549
- I'll drive you to the station, Larry.
- Fine, thank you.

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.395
- You're on your way again.
- Yes.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:06.836
I'm sorry I can't stay for the funeral.
I have to catch a boat.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:13.238
- So you're going back to America at last.
- That's right.

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.231
And what are you going to do?

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:18.631
I thought I might take a job
in a factory or a garage.

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.074
I've always liked machinery.

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:23.038
And when I'm washing a car
or tinkering with a carburetor...

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.953
...my minïs free, and I feel
I'm accomplishing something.

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:27.838
And after that?

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.999
I don't know.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.958
- I might buy a taxi.
- A taxi?

02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.192
It's a good life, always on the go.
You meet a lot of people.

02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:40.831
Oh, Larry, for heaven's sake.
What you need is a good psychiatrist.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.992
Sometimes I think you're completely
out of your mind.

02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.994
Just look what you've done
with your life. And with mine!

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.914
What in heaven's name
are you trying to prove?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.230
I'd hoped you'd come back
to the States with us.

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:06.631
Gray's going into business again,
and he'll need help.

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:08.870
You've no idea
what you've done for him.

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.318
He spoke of it again only yesterday.
You can't see the change, but I can.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:16.472
When you're around, he's different,
much like his old self.

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.235
- Gray's all right. He doesn't need me.
- But suppose he does?

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.472
Suppose something goes wrong again
and he has another breakdown?

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.437
You can't imagine
what he went through.

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.674
It wasn't just a matter of headaches
or nerves. He was sick, really sick.

02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:32.876
I've never told this
to anyone before...

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:35.713
...but for months and months,
we watched him every minute.

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:39.111
It wasn't just losing his money
and the business his father had built.

02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:42.477
It was more. He blamed himself
for all the things that happened...

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:45.757
...to those little people
who trusted him with their savings.

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.959
I honestly believe
if it hadn't been for the children...

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.509
...he'd have killed himself.

02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:55.956
Well, there's nothing so surprising
about that, Isabel.

02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.710
There isn't a man or woman
living today...

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.872
...who hasn't felt that way
at least once in their lives.

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.591
The wonderful thing about life
is that most of us get a second chance.

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:09.115
I got a second chance...

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.717
...right at the moment when I thought
there was nothing worthwhile living for.

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:19.151
Do you know what it means to see
another man give up his life for you?

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.869
Do you? Have you ever thought
what it is to walk the streets at night...

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.952
...knowing that you're walking
in another man's shoes?

02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.395
That someone deliberately died...

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.755
...so that you might go on living.

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:32.194
Listen.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.595
Do you remember that night in Chicago
when we talked at the country club?

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.036
I told you then that I didn't think
I'd ever find myself.

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:43.510
Well, I haven't yet, completely.

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.875
I've found some of the things
I was looking for.

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.716
Someday I may find them all, but in
any event, I'm going to keep on looking.

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.720
It isn't easy, and it isn't fun.

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.078
I've known moments of futility
and frustration. I've... .

02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:04.829
But that's all past now. Past and done.
I know what lies ahead.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.470
I know where I'm going. Gray,
in his own way, can do the same thing...

02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.156
...because this is his second chance.
And I know he'll come through.

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:18.559
All right. Suppose he does?
And what about me?

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:21.308
Doesn't it mean anything to you
that I love you?

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.710
That I've never loved anybody
else but you?

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:26.474
That my children might've been
your children? That...?

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:29.108
Oh, why didn't I marry you
when I had the chance?

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.111
I could have, you know I could have.

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.716
That night in Paris, you were ready
to give up all this foolishness for me.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.996
If I'd had brains enough,
I coulïve saved you.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.711
But no, I threw you out! I thought
I was being so noble, remember?

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:47.637
Look at me, Larry.
You know you love me.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.639
You know that you've always
wanted me.

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.476
Say it's true.
Say you know it's true.

02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:58.950
Oh, Larry, I love you.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:01.156
I love you.

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.869
Promise you'll come back with us.

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.235
Promise you will.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:21.313
Tell me about Sophie, Isabel.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.678
Sophie?

02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.796
What about Sophie?

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:34.350
That afternoon she came to your
apartment, did she have a drink?

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:36.750
- Yes.
- Perzovka?

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:38.353
How did you know?

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.397
Isn't it strange that she shoulïve asked
for such an unfamiliar liqueur?

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:50.114
She didn't ask for anything.
She just helped herself.

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.510
I had to pick up my daughter
at the dentist.

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:56.434
And when I returned, Sophie was gone
and the bottle was empty.

02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.036
When you found Sophie gone and
the bottle empty, weren't you surprised?

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:01.838
I thought she got tired of waiting.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.639
When I noticed the bottle,
I thought the butler drank it.

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.633
I very nearly spoke to him about it.

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:13.394
You never were a very good liar, Isabel.

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.835
You don't believe me.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.991
Not for a moment.

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:20.151
Then don't.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:30.078
All right, if you want the truth,
I did it, and I'd do it again.

02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:33.710
I was determined to prevent her marrying
you. Nobody else would do a thing!

02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:36.758
They didn't care. I did!
Oh, Larry, you men are such fools.

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:40.276
I knew that sooner or later,
she'd break down. It stuck out a mile.

02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:44.399
You saw how jittery she was at the Ritz.
I knew she'd give her soul for a drink.

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.791
The idea came when Uncle Elliott
made such a fuss about the stuff.

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.997
I hated it, but I pretended
it was wonderful.

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.909
I knew if she had a chance,
she'd never resist.

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.198
That's why I offered her a dress.

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:05.158
I made up my mind that if Sophie
hadn't touched the bottle...

02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:07.834
...I'd make the best of things
and try to be friends.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.560
That's true, I swear it!

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.515
When I came back,
saw the bottle was empty...

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.114
...I knew I'd been right all along.

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:19.314
That's pretty much what I thought.

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:21.594
Sophie's dead.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:35.037
Dead?

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.873
Her body was found
in the harbor at Toulon.

02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.156
She'd been murdered.

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.635
Oh, how horrible.

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.796
Do they know who did it?

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:49.877
No.

02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.836
But I do.

02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.715
There's no need to be shocked
about Sophie any longer, Isabel.

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:06.078
I've had the feeling all day that Sophie
is where she would want to be most...

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.750
...with Bob and Linda.

02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:13.036
Oh, I know it's a very usual
and simple way to look at it...

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:16.037
...but it's comforting.

02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.271
Goodbye, Isabel.

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:25.000
And take good care of Gray.

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:27.879
He needs you now more than ever.

02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:07.832
- He's gone.
- I know.

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.990
I've lost him.

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.191
Lost him for good.

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.237
And I love him.
I love him so tenderly.

02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:28.789
And now I've lost him.

02:17:29.559 --> 02:17:32.028
Do you suppose we'll ever
see him again?

02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:33.791
It isn't likely.

02:17:33.959 --> 02:17:37.076
His America will be as remote
from yours...

02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:41.438
...as the Gobi Desert.
- It's all so crazy, so useless.

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.798
What is he trying to do with his life?
What does he hope to find?

02:17:45.959 --> 02:17:50.272
My dear, Larry has found what we all
want and very few of us ever get.

02:17:50.959 --> 02:17:54.839
I don't think anyone can fail
to be better and nobler...

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.559
...kinder, for knowing him.

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.195
You see, my dear...

02:18:01.639 --> 02:18:06.873
...goodness is, after all,
the greatest force in the world.

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:09.395
And he's got it.
