WEBVTT

00:00.623 --> 00:01.790
Attention, everyone!

00:01.791 --> 00:04.624
Say good-bye to the Jake Peralta
you know and love,

00:04.627 --> 00:07.329
for today is the day
I forever change.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.064
Ooh, are you finally
growing a mustache?

00:09.098 --> 00:10.398
No, you know I can't do that,

00:10.399 --> 00:12.167
and it's cruel of you
to keep bringing it up.

00:12.201 --> 00:14.669
This envelope contains
the inheritance my uncle left me.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.905
He died a year ago;
he was so rich,

00:16.906 --> 00:18.907
he had a whole room
in his house just to eat in.

00:18.941 --> 00:20.375
You mean like a dining room?

00:20.409 --> 00:22.544
- Yeah, but in Manhattan.
- Oh, dang.

00:22.545 --> 00:24.413
Now, just because
I'm definitely rich now

00:24.414 --> 00:26.081
doesn't mean I'm gonna
forget my roots.

00:26.082 --> 00:28.083
You all get something,
so fire away.

00:28.117 --> 00:30.418
Jake, your friendship
is gift enough for me.

00:30.453 --> 00:32.888
Friendship is crap.
I want a Ducati Monster 821.

00:32.889 --> 00:34.623
All right,
Rosa gets a motorcycle.

00:34.657 --> 00:36.558
Oh, cool.
I want a fast sports car.

00:36.592 --> 00:37.993
Come on.
You can be honest.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.694
I want old, expensive books.
I'll send you a list.

00:39.729 --> 00:40.796
There you go.

00:40.797 --> 00:43.598
Now, let's find out
what I'm worth.

00:43.599 --> 00:45.634
Oh, I'm too nervous to open it.
Sarge, you do it.

00:45.668 --> 00:47.235
Okay.

00:49.338 --> 00:52.207
It's stock.
One million shares!

00:52.208 --> 00:53.642
Oh, my God!

00:53.643 --> 00:55.577
Of Blockbuster Video stock.

00:55.611 --> 00:58.146
- Ohh.
- What? Is that bad?

00:58.147 --> 01:00.649
I still have a Blockbuster card!

01:00.650 --> 01:02.350
What happened to Blockbuster?

01:28.544 --> 01:31.246
mapping, mapping.

01:31.247 --> 01:32.781
What's going on there, buddy?

01:32.782 --> 01:34.883
Just making a final
imprint of your face

01:34.884 --> 01:36.718
before the LASIK surgery
goes poorly

01:36.719 --> 01:38.487
and my eyeballs get burned off.

01:38.521 --> 01:41.089
Why stop at the eyes?
Burn off your whole head.

01:41.124 --> 01:44.559
Charles, the surgery
is going to go fine, all right?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.495
You'll have some vision
impairment for a few hours,

01:46.496 --> 01:47.763
and I'm gonna be with you
the whole time!

01:47.797 --> 01:49.798
Plus, they're gonna give you
some of those sweet-ass

01:49.799 --> 01:51.299
Robocop sunglasses.

01:51.334 --> 01:53.502
Those are blind people
sunglasses.

01:54.504 --> 01:56.638
Captain.
What are you doing here?

01:56.672 --> 01:58.607
Thought you took the day off
to pack for your big trip,

01:58.608 --> 01:59.875
or did you finally realize

01:59.876 --> 02:01.710
that it only takes
one minute to pack?

02:01.744 --> 02:03.078
Not if you care
about your possessions

02:03.079 --> 02:04.546
and what the world sees
when they look at you.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.281
- Huh.
- I'm not going.

02:06.315 --> 02:07.849
Cheddar's regular
dog sitter is ill,

02:07.850 --> 02:09.151
and the heat's out in my house,

02:09.151 --> 02:10.685
so I don't think
it's a good time for me

02:10.686 --> 02:12.387
to visit Kevin in Paris.

02:12.388 --> 02:14.523
Sir, you can't
just cancel your trip.

02:14.524 --> 02:16.525
You guys haven't seen
each other in months.

02:16.526 --> 02:19.027
Amy and I

02:19.028 --> 02:20.862
will look after your house
while you're gone.

02:20.863 --> 02:22.698
- Right, Ames?
- Totally.

02:22.732 --> 02:25.333
I thought you two were
watching Ray Charles Boyle.

02:25.368 --> 02:26.501
Good point.

02:26.502 --> 02:28.570
Charles can come with us
and look after Cheddar.

02:28.571 --> 02:29.638
I'm told that blind people

02:29.639 --> 02:31.273
have a special connection
with dogs.

02:31.274 --> 02:33.375
I knew it.
You do think I'm gonna go blind.

02:33.409 --> 02:34.643
That's an interesting offer,

02:34.644 --> 02:35.877
but I don't want to be
an imposition.

02:35.912 --> 02:39.014
Pshaw!
Imposition? Pshaw!

02:39.048 --> 02:40.182
No, I was talking to Santiago.

02:40.216 --> 02:41.550
I assume she'll be
doing all the work.

02:41.584 --> 02:42.818
Why?

02:42.819 --> 02:44.486
Oh, because of our track records
and personalities.

02:44.487 --> 02:45.754
Sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah.

02:45.788 --> 02:48.190
So, Santiago, are you sure
you're okay with this?

02:48.224 --> 02:51.360
I'm so in.
This is gonna be fantastic.

02:51.394 --> 02:53.328
This is horrible!
We're not ready for this.

02:53.329 --> 02:55.330
This is a level one
responsibility.

02:55.365 --> 02:58.367
I'm a level two at best,
and you're not even a level!

02:58.401 --> 02:59.768
Well, I'm a level, you know.

02:59.769 --> 03:01.436
I'm probably, like,
a level five.

03:01.471 --> 03:03.472
Not a level.

03:03.473 --> 03:04.906
I thought you'd be psyched.

03:04.907 --> 03:06.341
I mean, a week
at Captain Holt's house?

03:06.342 --> 03:08.010
Wasn't that where you wanted
to spend your honeymoon?

03:08.011 --> 03:09.778
Yeah, but this
is too much pressure!

03:09.779 --> 03:11.046
Why did you volunteer
us for this?

03:11.080 --> 03:14.082
Because Holt hasn't
seen Kevin in, like, months,

03:14.083 --> 03:17.052
and I was just thinking
if that was me and you,

03:17.053 --> 03:18.587
it would make me really sad.

03:18.621 --> 03:22.424
Oh. That's actually super sweet.

03:22.458 --> 03:24.159
Plus, therthis big, fat binder

03:24.160 --> 03:25.927
full of instructions and rules.

03:25.962 --> 03:27.663
There's a binder?

03:27.664 --> 03:29.931
Why didn't you lead
with that, you idiot?

03:29.932 --> 03:30.932
Oh!

03:30.967 --> 03:32.467
How about I just
leave you two alone?

03:32.468 --> 03:34.403
Okay.

03:34.404 --> 03:36.304
Diaz.

03:36.305 --> 03:37.305
Pimento.

03:39.742 --> 03:41.443
- What's up?
- What's up with you?

03:41.444 --> 03:43.912
- I need you to sign this report.
- Okay.

03:43.913 --> 03:45.280
I'll sign your report.

03:59.696 --> 04:00.696
Mm.

04:02.265 --> 04:03.865
What the hell?

04:04.934 --> 04:06.435
Mm.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.939
Careful.
The ink's still wet.

04:10.974 --> 04:12.641
Maybe this'll help.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.585
Okay, they got
to knock that off.

04:23.586 --> 04:26.321
- Loosen up, Sarge.
- Summer of love, baby.

04:26.356 --> 04:27.923
It's March, man.
Shut up.

04:27.957 --> 04:29.691
It's true what they say.

04:29.692 --> 04:31.059
Now that I'm fully
blind forever,

04:31.060 --> 04:33.195
my other senses are heightened.

04:33.196 --> 04:34.930
I feel a door.

04:34.931 --> 04:36.164
We're at Captain Holt's house.

04:36.199 --> 04:38.233
Also, the GPS announced it
when we pulled up.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.334
Hey, once we're inside,

04:39.335 --> 04:40.936
maybe keep your hands
to yourself, all right?

04:40.970 --> 04:43.138
The captain can be
very particular about his stuff.

04:43.139 --> 04:45.140
Cheddar! Let go!
Let go of it!

04:45.174 --> 04:47.743
- Amy?
- This is a cashmere sweater!

04:47.744 --> 04:50.612
Oh, my stupid allergies!

04:50.613 --> 04:52.047
He got into Kevin's closet.

04:52.048 --> 04:53.282
He was supposed
to stay downstairs.

04:53.283 --> 04:54.916
The binder was very clear
about that.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.451
Why won't you respect
the binder?

04:56.452 --> 04:58.153
Oh, no, he's turning
all the turtlenecks

04:58.154 --> 04:59.421
into regular necks.

04:59.422 --> 05:00.989
- Charles, you got to help us.
- On it.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.425
Okay, the key with dogs
is establishing the alpha.

05:03.426 --> 05:06.261
Cheddah, dwop it.
Pwease dwop it.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.896
I'll give you anything you want.

05:07.931 --> 05:10.365
Oh, Cheddar is the alpha.
Didn't expect that.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.267
Pwease, pwease, pwease.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.203
Nice job, Boyle.
It worked.

05:15.238 --> 05:17.639
But the mess, Jake.
The mess!

05:17.640 --> 05:19.308
Don't worry.
We're gonna clean it up.

05:19.309 --> 05:21.543
Everything is totally
under control.

05:21.577 --> 05:23.312
- Charles' pants are on fire.
- What?

05:23.346 --> 05:25.414
Boyle, the space heater!
Get away from the space heater!

05:25.415 --> 05:26.748
I don't know where it is!

05:26.749 --> 05:28.350
I'm just gonna run
at full speed!

05:28.351 --> 05:30.018
- No!
- Aah!

05:30.053 --> 05:31.420
Charles, just stay
where you are!

05:31.454 --> 05:32.554
I got it.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.026
Whoo!
Okay.

05:38.027 --> 05:39.428
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

05:39.429 --> 05:41.863
Fire's out.
And this table is...

05:41.864 --> 05:43.332
Oh!

05:43.333 --> 05:45.200
Fragile.
I was gonna say fragile.

05:45.201 --> 05:47.035
- Nailed it.
- Ah!

05:52.609 --> 05:54.476
You punching holes?

05:54.477 --> 05:56.411
- Yeah.
- That's way too much paper.

05:56.446 --> 05:59.114
Not for me.

05:59.115 --> 06:00.949
Can't even get a cup of coffee.

06:07.890 --> 06:09.992
Well, I'm off to find
some yellow paper

06:09.993 --> 06:15.464
so I can do this all over again.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.469
All right, Diaz?
That's it.

06:20.470 --> 06:21.637
What's going on with you two?

06:21.671 --> 06:23.472
- Oh, you noticed it?
- Yeah, I noticed it!

06:23.506 --> 06:25.073
Everyone's noticed it!

06:25.074 --> 06:27.609
A convicted pervert asked me
if you guys could cool it.

06:27.644 --> 06:29.645
I don't know what to tell you.

06:29.646 --> 06:31.880
Something between us, Sarge.

06:31.881 --> 06:33.715
Something dark and urgent.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.118
Ah.

06:36.119 --> 06:37.653
Okay.
Great news.

06:37.654 --> 06:39.655
The smell of burnt sweatpants
and singed leg hair

06:39.656 --> 06:40.956
is finally dissipating.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.958
I just hope I can
grow it back by Speedo season.

06:44.394 --> 06:46.662
<i>Call from Raymond Holt, mobile.</i>

06:46.696 --> 06:47.796
Oh, no. Not Holt.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.131
Don't worry.
I've got this.

06:51.701 --> 06:54.603
<i>Bonjour, Captain.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?</i>

06:54.637 --> 06:56.305
No, I don't
want to sleep with you.

06:56.339 --> 06:57.606
Is that what that means?

06:57.607 --> 07:00.142
Oh, man, I had a really gross
tennis instructor.

07:00.176 --> 07:02.344
I'm calling to check in
before I get on the flight.

07:02.345 --> 07:04.413
- Everything okay?
- Okay?

07:04.414 --> 07:07.516
Let's just say if the house
could talk, she would say,

07:07.517 --> 07:10.185
"I've never been happier;
I love Jake."

07:10.220 --> 07:11.720
Oh, that's interesting,
because I think

07:11.721 --> 07:14.790
the house might say
"Jake's a liar, and I'm...

07:14.791 --> 07:16.325
on fire."

07:16.359 --> 07:17.593
What's that now?

07:17.627 --> 07:19.094
The security company
called me about the alarm.

07:19.095 --> 07:21.763
Okay, the house
was never on fire.

07:21.764 --> 07:24.166
Charles was on fire,
and only on his pants,

07:24.167 --> 07:25.334
and we put it out.

07:25.368 --> 07:26.535
I'm coming home right now.

07:26.569 --> 07:28.036
Wait, no.
Sir, please don't do that.

07:28.037 --> 07:29.972
You have to go see Kevin.
Everything's fine.

07:29.973 --> 07:32.474
No, my decision is final.
I'm postponing my flight.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.474
Good-bye, Jacob.

07:33.476 --> 07:35.144
No, sir!
Please, please... ahh!

07:35.145 --> 07:36.678
He said "Jacob."

07:36.679 --> 07:38.080
It's biblical.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.314
Guys, guys!

07:39.315 --> 07:40.549
Holt is headed home right now.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.217
No!
He can't come home.

07:42.218 --> 07:43.952
We left the door open,
and the dog ran out.

07:43.987 --> 07:45.053
What? We lost Cheddar?

07:47.523 --> 07:49.258
These silences
are very hard for me to read.

07:49.259 --> 07:51.786
- What's the vibe in here?
- We're freaking out, Charles!

07:53.992 --> 07:56.227
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for joining me.

07:56.261 --> 07:59.397
What we have here
is a fugitive situation.

07:59.398 --> 08:01.078
Our man has been on the run
for 30 minutes.

08:01.099 --> 08:04.068
Also, our man is a dog.

08:04.069 --> 08:05.803
Now, I know what
some of you are thinking:

08:05.804 --> 08:07.872
"Who cares?
It's just a pet."

08:07.906 --> 08:09.540
No one was thinking that,
you monster.

08:09.574 --> 08:11.876
Good.
That was a test.

08:11.910 --> 08:14.378
Now, the average foot speed
of a corgi

08:14.379 --> 08:15.646
is ten miles per hour,

08:15.647 --> 08:17.615
which means
with every passing second,

08:17.616 --> 08:20.518
that slippery bastard
gets farther away.

08:23.889 --> 08:27.258
Captain Holt does not know
Cheddar is missing...

08:27.259 --> 08:28.559
but he's gonna find out.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.962
Oh, God, I feel like the devil
is dancing on my chest.

08:30.963 --> 08:32.996
It's all right, Amy.
We have time.

08:32.998 --> 08:34.597
Gina's picking Holt up
at the airport,

08:34.599 --> 08:36.839
and she told me she can stall
him for at least two hours.

08:36.868 --> 08:40.571
I'll do it, but I'm gonna
have to total your car.

08:40.572 --> 08:43.341
Or you could just drive slowly.

08:43.342 --> 08:45.176
Ha-ha, she's gonna
wreck your car.

08:45.210 --> 08:46.243
Here's where we're at.

08:46.244 --> 08:47.678
Amy and I will take
Blind Charles

08:47.713 --> 08:48.746
and search the neighborhood.

08:48.780 --> 08:49.880
Diaz, Pimento...

08:49.915 --> 08:51.249
Bring the dog back,

08:51.250 --> 08:52.550
dead or alive.

08:52.584 --> 08:54.485
What? No.
I was gonna say hang posters.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.787
Terry, maybe go with them,
make sure nobody gets killed.

08:56.822 --> 08:58.289
Or maybe I could
join another group

08:58.290 --> 08:59.570
with a different kind of energy?

08:59.591 --> 09:00.958
Jake, what about
me and Hitchcock?

09:00.993 --> 09:02.426
You two grab Cheddar's treats

09:02.427 --> 09:03.861
and put 'em in a bowl outside.

09:03.896 --> 09:06.197
You mean the little sausage
ones that need way more salt?

09:06.231 --> 09:08.399
On second thought, maybe just
sit exactly where you are

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
and don't touch anything.

09:09.401 --> 09:10.668
Sweet.

09:10.669 --> 09:13.170
All right, everyone,
it's time to do this.

09:13.171 --> 09:16.574
For Captain Holt,
for Kevin, for America!

09:16.608 --> 09:18.476
Let's go, Nine-Nine!

09:19.478 --> 09:21.612
<i>This line is interminable.</i>

09:21.647 --> 09:23.814
At this rate,
we'll be home in 54 minutes

09:23.815 --> 09:25.916
instead of the usual 46.

09:25.917 --> 09:28.419
Not if I have
anything to do with it.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.587
Watch me now!

09:30.789 --> 09:32.223
No, Gina, the wrong way.

09:32.257 --> 09:33.925
No, Gina, the spikes!

09:35.494 --> 09:36.994
Uh-oh.

09:36.995 --> 09:38.029
Well, not a problem.

09:38.030 --> 09:39.730
I can get you home
on two wheels.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.869
And that was
the second pair of tires.

09:51.043 --> 09:52.510
Mm.

09:52.511 --> 09:53.644
I could've done that.

09:53.645 --> 09:55.346
Yeah, I know you could've.

09:55.347 --> 09:57.648
But you didn't.
I did.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.722
I mean, there are lots
of other poles, guys.

10:04.723 --> 10:06.390
A whole street full of 'em.

10:06.391 --> 10:07.825
So, Adrian,

10:07.826 --> 10:09.293
when are we gonna
stop messing around

10:09.294 --> 10:10.628
and do this thing?

10:11.997 --> 10:13.598
Um...

10:15.434 --> 10:16.867
- N-never.
- What?

10:16.868 --> 10:18.703
You know what?
I just realized.

10:18.704 --> 10:21.772
I forgot something at home.
I'm just gonna...

10:26.044 --> 10:28.246
That was weird.
You okay?

10:28.247 --> 10:30.915
Yes.

10:38.090 --> 10:39.557
<i>All right, according to the call</i>

10:39.558 --> 10:40.825
<i>we just got on the tip line,</i>

10:40.826 --> 10:42.546
<i>someone said they saw
Cheddar on this block.</i>

10:42.561 --> 10:43.961
I'll head north.
Jake, you head west.

10:43.962 --> 10:45.329
We'll meet back in a half hour.

10:45.364 --> 10:46.964
Great, which direction
should I go?

10:50.068 --> 10:52.270
What's going on?
I can hear your lips moving.

10:52.271 --> 10:53.671
Ah!
Are you guys kissing?

10:53.705 --> 10:54.705
What? No.

10:54.706 --> 10:56.541
Charles, stop always
asking that.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.876
Look, I'm sorry,
but you have to stay in the car.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.378
That's a mistake!

11:00.379 --> 11:02.813
My super senses are a tool
you can't afford to leave

11:02.814 --> 11:04.315
in the tool chest.

11:04.316 --> 11:06.984
Take me out of the box
and put me on your belt.

11:07.019 --> 11:09.420
I'm sorry, but you'd
only slow us down.

11:09.421 --> 11:11.255
And that's exactly
what Cheddar wants.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.623
That's right.

11:12.624 --> 11:15.593
I'm onto you,
you slippery little bastard.

11:19.164 --> 11:20.398
Gina, come on.

11:20.399 --> 11:21.866
You can do your Internet
socializing in the truck.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.535
Okay, cool, I just have
to tie my shoe real quick.

11:24.570 --> 11:26.237
Tying it.

11:26.238 --> 11:27.905
Call Jake Peralta.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.074
Gina, hey, how's the stalling?

11:30.108 --> 11:31.442
Great; the tow truck
just got here,

11:31.443 --> 11:32.910
so that'll buy us
at least an hour.

11:32.945 --> 11:34.745
Tow truck? What the hell
did you do to my car?

11:34.780 --> 11:36.747
Bitch, I told you
I was gonna wreck it.

11:36.782 --> 11:37.915
You did.
You did.

11:37.916 --> 11:39.417
All right, well,
we're about to go

11:39.418 --> 11:41.052
follow up on a lead right now.

11:41.086 --> 11:43.521
Great; I'm gonna rip a bunch
of wires out of your dashboard.

11:43.555 --> 11:45.590
What? No, don't!
Gina...

11:45.591 --> 11:46.591
Gah!

11:47.826 --> 11:49.727
I got nothing.
Did you find Cheddar?

11:49.728 --> 11:52.964
Close.
I found Shredder.

11:52.965 --> 11:55.266
Shredder, no!
No, Shredder!

11:55.267 --> 11:56.901
You're not Cheddar!

11:56.935 --> 12:00.104
I know it looks bad,
but we're gonna find him.

12:00.105 --> 12:01.973
Right after we find Charles.

12:01.974 --> 12:03.608
Charles is gone.
We lost Charles.

12:03.642 --> 12:05.810
- What?
- Charles? Charles!

12:05.811 --> 12:07.111
Here, boy!

12:07.112 --> 12:08.560
Here, boy!

12:09.650 --> 12:11.859
Oh, I should've known
I was gonna lose Charles.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.662
He's so pocket-sized.
He could be hidden anywhere!

12:13.697 --> 12:15.598
Jake, we need
to focus on Cheddar.

12:15.599 --> 12:17.600
Charles is a grown man.
He can take care of himself.

12:17.634 --> 12:19.402
No, he's not.
He's a Charles, all right?

12:19.403 --> 12:20.402
And he's blind!

12:20.403 --> 12:22.104
Oh, God,
he's probably already dead.

12:22.138 --> 12:24.173
Right? So let's not waste
any resources on him.

12:24.174 --> 12:25.641
Wait, it's Charles.

12:25.675 --> 12:27.777
- Charles?
- Jake? Is that you?

12:27.778 --> 12:28.911
I can't see my phone.

12:28.912 --> 12:30.679
I've dialed
over 40 wrong numbers.

12:30.714 --> 12:32.181
- It's me.
- I found Cheddar.

12:32.215 --> 12:33.516
He found Cheddar!

12:33.517 --> 12:34.783
Which is why I was like,
"We need to go to him."

12:34.818 --> 12:35.885
Charles, where are you?

12:35.886 --> 12:37.420
I've got him cornered
in some bushes,

12:37.421 --> 12:38.721
but I don't know
where I am, and my...

12:38.722 --> 12:39.989
<i>Wait, stop talking.</i>

12:40.023 --> 12:41.390
I'm hearing something
in the background.

12:41.391 --> 12:43.626
What is that, a train
and a girl whimpering?

12:43.660 --> 12:45.494
That's me; I'm so scared
you're not gonna find me.

12:45.495 --> 12:47.897
Charles, don't move.
I know exactly where you are.

12:47.898 --> 12:49.532
He's at the entrance
by 7th Street.

12:49.533 --> 12:50.766
I used to hang out there
all the time.

12:50.801 --> 12:51.800
Doing what?

12:53.303 --> 12:55.371
Aw!
I boofed it.

12:55.372 --> 12:57.473
Nothing. Cool stuff.
Having sex.

12:57.474 --> 12:58.914
Anyways, it doesn't matter.
Let's go.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.346
- Aah!
- Hey, Sarge.

13:04.347 --> 13:05.948
- I've been waiting for you.
- In here?

13:05.949 --> 13:07.917
Yeah, I wanted to have
a private conversation.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.085
Do you think Diaz noticed

13:09.086 --> 13:11.053
that I freaked out a little
when she asked me out?

13:11.087 --> 13:12.788
You mean the way your eyes
popped out of your head

13:12.789 --> 13:14.457
and you sprinted away
at full speed?

13:14.458 --> 13:16.959
- Yeah, I think she noticed.
- Damn it.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.661
I'm in kind of a weird
head space right now.

13:18.662 --> 13:21.197
I've got a lot on my plate,
emotionally speaking.

13:21.198 --> 13:23.833
And flirting's one thing,
but a relationship?

13:23.867 --> 13:25.334
Well...

13:25.335 --> 13:28.104
The last time I let myself
fall for someone was Katya.

13:28.105 --> 13:29.839
She was a bartender
at the Garbage Box,

13:29.873 --> 13:32.842
second-rate strip club my mob
buddies and I used to go to.

13:32.876 --> 13:35.377
She was a sweet girl, but I couldn't
save her from the pole.

13:35.412 --> 13:38.180
- Oh, she started stripping?
- Nope.

13:38.181 --> 13:40.583
Boss impaled her on a pole when
he caught her skimming tips.

13:40.617 --> 13:42.551
Ooh! Damn, dude.

13:42.552 --> 13:45.054
Look, coming back
from 12 years undercover

13:45.055 --> 13:47.023
is not easy for anyone.

13:47.024 --> 13:48.424
I'm sure Diaz gets it.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.293
She's so in touch
with her feelings.

13:51.294 --> 13:53.229
And me, hmm.

13:53.230 --> 13:56.332
After what I've seen,
after what I've done,

13:56.333 --> 13:58.000
I don't know
that I deserve to be happy.

13:58.034 --> 14:00.236
Of course you do.

14:00.237 --> 14:02.071
Huh.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.306
I never looked at it that way.

14:04.307 --> 14:08.010
Wow.
That changes everything.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
Ha!

14:11.481 --> 14:12.448
I never even finished my point.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.418
No, Sarge, you said it all.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.420
You just changed my life.

14:18.422 --> 14:21.323
He's got to be here somewhere.

14:21.324 --> 14:22.491
What's up, Peralta?

14:22.492 --> 14:23.926
Want to jump in
on this tasty sesh?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.928
Uh, you got the wrong guy.
I've never seen you before.

14:25.929 --> 14:27.263
Heh, dumb stoner.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.665
- He referred to you by name.
- Hey, there's Charles.

14:29.666 --> 14:32.034
- Jake? Jake?
- Charles, we're behind you.

14:32.035 --> 14:34.437
Look!
I found Cheddar.

14:34.471 --> 14:36.138
- I found him.
- Oh, God.

14:36.173 --> 14:38.574
I know.
Pretty impressive, right?

14:38.575 --> 14:41.477
It's a proud day
for blind people everywhere.

14:41.511 --> 14:43.813
- Charles...
- It wasn't easy, though.

14:43.814 --> 14:45.948
This guy put up quite a fight.

14:45.949 --> 14:48.284
But we're
good friends now, right?

14:48.285 --> 14:50.319
Right?
You gave me a bunch of kisses.

14:50.354 --> 14:52.388
You gave me a bunch of kisses.

14:52.422 --> 14:54.090
Damn it, Charles, it's a possum.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.629
Oh, no.

15:01.832 --> 15:03.632
Mercifully, the tires
have been replaced,

15:03.633 --> 15:05.067
so may I please have the keys?

15:05.102 --> 15:07.003
Okay, but before we go,

15:07.004 --> 15:09.105
can we just choose
a nice air freshener

15:09.106 --> 15:10.473
from the gift shop?

15:10.474 --> 15:12.808
You never know when you're gonna
find your signature scent.

15:12.843 --> 15:14.543
I'm not an idiot, Gina;
I know for a fact

15:14.544 --> 15:16.679
you've already found
your signature scent.

15:16.713 --> 15:20.182
Ugh! I have got to stop
living my life out loud.

15:20.183 --> 15:22.418
I've had a hell of a day.

15:22.419 --> 15:24.520
I've got a lot
going on in my life,

15:24.521 --> 15:27.089
more than Peralta
ruining my house,

15:27.090 --> 15:29.325
so can we please
drop the charade

15:29.326 --> 15:31.560
so I can get home already?

15:31.561 --> 15:33.329
Absolutely, sir.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.434
Wait, I should tell you.

15:38.435 --> 15:40.636
Before you got real with me...

15:41.972 --> 15:43.906
I did rip out all these wires.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.810
All right, everyone, listen up.

15:47.844 --> 15:48.878
Here's where we're at.

15:48.912 --> 15:51.847
Cheddar is still at large,

15:51.848 --> 15:53.883
and you know
that slippery little bastard

15:53.884 --> 15:55.785
is just laughing at us.

15:58.655 --> 16:00.656
We need a new plan,
and we need it now.

16:00.691 --> 16:03.025
Because the walls are
closing in and I can't breathe.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.360
Come on, guys,
we're just spitballing.

16:04.361 --> 16:05.628
There's no stupid ideas.

16:05.662 --> 16:07.263
What if we walk
around the neighborhood

16:07.264 --> 16:08.698
in Captain Holt's clothes,

16:08.699 --> 16:10.333
wait till Cheddar
picks up the smell?

16:10.367 --> 16:11.734
No, that's insane,
never gonna happen.

16:11.735 --> 16:13.569
- Anyone else?
- You guys go off the grid.

16:13.603 --> 16:14.970
I'm listening. Go on.

16:14.971 --> 16:16.672
I get you guys
Mexican passports.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.074
Totally untraceable.

16:18.075 --> 16:19.842
We fake your death
in an apartment fire.

16:19.843 --> 16:21.911
I'll need three teeth
from both of you.

16:21.945 --> 16:25.014
Then you guys just disappear.

16:25.015 --> 16:26.749
It's easy.
I've done it before.

16:26.783 --> 16:28.050
Oh, have you?

16:28.051 --> 16:29.485
Because you haven't
mentioned it 500 times.

16:29.486 --> 16:31.387
- Get a new thing.
- Okay.

16:31.388 --> 16:34.090
Amazingly, wearing Holt's
clothes is our best option.

16:34.091 --> 16:38.327
Everyone, prepare
to enter high society.

16:48.739 --> 16:50.873
Okay, how's everybody feeling?

16:50.907 --> 16:53.609
Anyone else have the weird urge
to lecture themselves?

16:53.610 --> 16:56.646
"Peralta, what are you doing?"

16:56.647 --> 16:58.848
Peralta, what are you doing?

16:58.849 --> 17:00.983
I conjured him.

17:00.984 --> 17:03.386
Captain Holt!
What a pleasant surprise.

17:03.387 --> 17:06.088
Gina told me that you were
delayed due to a wire situation.

17:06.123 --> 17:08.657
Yes, the situation is,
you can rip them all out

17:08.659 --> 17:10.726
but the car still works.

17:10.727 --> 17:12.127
Sorry, boo.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.231
Wait, why is
the whole squad here?

17:15.265 --> 17:17.300
And why is everyone
wearing my clothes?

17:17.334 --> 17:20.303
My God.

17:20.304 --> 17:22.305
You lost Cheddar.

17:22.306 --> 17:24.106
How did you do that?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.361
Sir, I know you're upset,

17:27.396 --> 17:29.163
but I promise you
we can find Cheddar

17:29.164 --> 17:30.865
and you can still go to Paris.

17:30.899 --> 17:32.166
I'm not going to Paris.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.868
Now, get out of my clothes.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.236
Get into your clothes.

17:35.237 --> 17:36.570
Get out of my house.

17:36.571 --> 17:37.772
Get into your cars...

17:37.806 --> 17:39.507
All right, we can
take it from there.

17:39.508 --> 17:42.443
Loud and clear.
Once again, so sorry.

17:45.514 --> 17:47.615
Oh, he's so disappointed.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.550
Look, I'm sorry
that I got you involved in this.

17:49.551 --> 17:50.952
I never should have
volunteered us.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.154
No, Jake.
It's not your fault.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.856
- It's Amy's.
- What?

17:54.857 --> 17:56.424
Well, it's not my fault.

17:56.425 --> 17:58.159
- Blind.
- Ugh.

17:58.193 --> 17:59.527
And Jake's not the one
who let Cheddar

17:59.528 --> 18:00.995
go to town on Kevin's sweaters.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.197
Please, it's not like
I fed him Kevin's sweaters.

18:03.198 --> 18:05.833
Wait a minute, guys.
I think this is Kevin's fault.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.335
No, Jake, it's Amy's.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.103
I know you're trying
to be a cool boyfriend...

18:09.104 --> 18:11.239
yet another reason
why it's not your fault...

18:11.240 --> 18:12.840
but Kevin's in Paris.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.309
Exactly, and that's why
I think it's Kevin's fault.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.811
I have an idea
of how to find Cheddar.

18:16.812 --> 18:19.647
Amy, don't act weird
when I say this,

18:19.648 --> 18:22.116
but we're gonna need
to use the binder.

18:22.117 --> 18:24.185
Oh, Mama.

18:24.219 --> 18:25.953
Diaz!

18:28.156 --> 18:30.424
- Could we talk?
- What do you want, Pimento?

18:30.459 --> 18:33.261
Listen, Sarge gave me
some really great advice.

18:33.295 --> 18:36.797
So, Rosa Diaz,

18:36.798 --> 18:37.932
will you marry me?

18:37.966 --> 18:38.966
What?

18:38.967 --> 18:40.207
This is what you told me to do!

18:40.235 --> 18:41.536
I barely said anything!

18:41.537 --> 18:43.004
You cut me off way too early.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.672
Sarge, stay out of this.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.307
Gladly.

18:46.308 --> 18:48.542
No, I will not marry you.

18:48.543 --> 18:51.012
How about we just
get a drink first?

18:51.013 --> 18:53.681
Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds nice.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.751
Oh, that's actually sweet.

18:56.752 --> 18:57.852
Nope.

18:58.854 --> 19:00.454
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

19:00.489 --> 19:03.591
<i>Captain Holt!
Oh, he can't hear me.</i>

19:06.061 --> 19:07.562
Eh...

19:07.563 --> 19:10.531
Okay, well, I guess we know
what those wires did.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.900
I'm not in the mood
for your antics, Peralta.

19:12.935 --> 19:14.101
Sir, sir!

19:14.102 --> 19:15.803
I think we know
where Cheddar is.

19:15.837 --> 19:17.872
Will you please
just get in the car?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.078
Oh, let me get that.

19:24.112 --> 19:25.646
Try now.

19:25.647 --> 19:27.248
Oh, I can't control the locks.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.717
Hang on. Try now.
One, two, three.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.786
Try now. Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

19:31.787 --> 19:33.487
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

19:33.488 --> 19:34.856
Try now.
Try now.

19:34.890 --> 19:36.357
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

19:36.358 --> 19:37.725
Try now.

19:37.726 --> 19:39.393
Cheddar!

19:39.394 --> 19:40.561
Come here, baby.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.431
Yeah, yeah.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.867
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

19:45.868 --> 19:47.168
How did you know he was here?

19:47.202 --> 19:50.137
Well, Cheddar was only
chewing up Kevin's stuff.

19:50.138 --> 19:51.639
I figured maybe
he was acting out

19:51.640 --> 19:53.608
because he missed Kevin.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.043
But the real hero here
is the binder.

19:56.044 --> 19:57.778
Under "Cheddar,"
subsection "Walk,"

19:57.779 --> 19:59.514
subsection "Walks with Kevin,"

19:59.515 --> 20:01.349
we found this special spot.

20:01.383 --> 20:03.084
So you're missing Kevin, huh?

20:03.085 --> 20:04.252
You're not the only one.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.523
I didn't cancel my trip
because I was worried

20:08.524 --> 20:10.491
you would burn my house down.

20:10.492 --> 20:13.795
Kevin and I are having
a hard time right now.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.430
Whenever we talk, we fight.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.900
And I'm just afraid and just...

20:18.901 --> 20:23.070
just afraid that if I go
to Paris and we fight, then...

20:23.105 --> 20:26.240
Sir, with all due respect,
that's crazy.

20:26.241 --> 20:29.210
I mean, you and Kevin
are the best couple I know.

20:29.211 --> 20:33.715
And I'm sure whatever this is,
you can get through it,

20:33.716 --> 20:36.317
because you are
the strongest person I know.

20:36.351 --> 20:38.719
Wow, that was weird;
I said, like, multiple

20:38.754 --> 20:41.556
real things consecutively, yeah.

20:41.557 --> 20:43.391
Felt weird but good.
Are you proud of me?

20:43.392 --> 20:44.459
- You're ruining it.
- Yup.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.760
I'm just gonna stop talking now.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.094
Well, I suppose
I'm not gonna solve anything

20:47.095 --> 20:48.696
by running away from it.

20:48.697 --> 20:50.631
Perhaps I should go to Paris.

20:50.632 --> 20:53.568
What do you think, Cheddar?
Huh?

20:53.602 --> 20:56.092
Oh, my, oh!
You really are acting out!

20:56.093 --> 20:59.576
Whew!
I'm sorry you had to see that.

20:59.577 --> 21:00.914
Oh.

21:00.915 --> 21:04.027
You know,
it's moments like these

21:04.028 --> 21:05.864
that I'm grateful for your...

21:07.478 --> 21:11.283
Guys, it's a miracle!
I can see!

21:11.284 --> 21:12.606
- Not now, Charles!
- Shut up!

21:12.607 --> 21:13.761
Right, sorry!

21:13.762 --> 21:16.793
Sorry.
