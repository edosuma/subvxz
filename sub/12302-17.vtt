WEBVTT

01:00.628 --> 01:01.901
Help.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.489
Somebody.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.474
Oh, my God.

01:06.475 --> 01:07.980
There's gas leaking out of the plane.

01:07.981 --> 01:09.346
It's going to blow.

01:17.742 --> 01:19.833
- Anybody aboard ?
- One more, Lieutenant, up front.

01:34.169 --> 01:35.559
I think I got a broken leg.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.028
I'm with the city,
and I'm getting you out of here.

01:38.029 --> 01:39.319
Here we go.

03:14.899 --> 03:16.462
I don't know what happened.

03:16.934 --> 03:18.249
Takeoff was clean.

03:19.304 --> 03:20.682
Suddenly, there was a flash.

03:21.332 --> 03:23.566
You say flash.
You mean explosion, right ?

03:23.889 --> 03:26.073
No, no, just a flash, um...

03:26.941 --> 03:28.282
everything went green.

03:29.225 --> 03:30.689
"Everything went green" ?

03:31.338 --> 03:32.740
Check his eyes, please.

03:41.659 --> 03:43.049
He has damage.

03:43.570 --> 03:44.836
Corneal scarring.

03:45.295 --> 03:46.585
What could've caused that ?

03:46.586 --> 03:48.050
I don't know, maybe a laser.

03:48.571 --> 03:50.010
Wait. You mean someone
from the ground ? We were...

03:50.011 --> 03:51.376
we were a quarter-mile up.

03:51.672 --> 03:54.899
See, a five-milliwatt laser could
reach two miles in the air, though.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.500
Excuse me.

04:06.758 --> 04:08.074
Yeah, Eric. Um...

04:08.582 --> 04:11.250
Call the control tower.
I want a copy of the nav-aids.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.348
I want to find out
who brought this plane down.

04:33.588 --> 04:34.854
Hey, stranger.

04:35.507 --> 04:36.810
John.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.597
Oh my goodness.

04:38.858 --> 04:41.029
- How've you been ?
- Great.

04:41.203 --> 04:42.506
You're looking good.

04:44.181 --> 04:45.720
Thanks. I'm sorry.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.212
I'm just surprised.
I haven't seen you in a while.

04:48.213 --> 04:49.889
Actually, this is my first week back.

04:50.162 --> 04:53.376
I'm acting as department liaison
for the NTSB boys on the crash.

04:53.909 --> 04:55.572
Oh, really ? So we're
gonna be working together.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.974
Looks like it.

04:58.010 --> 04:59.936
I tried calling you a couple of times.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.415
It's just, it's been really crazy at the lab.

05:02.490 --> 05:04.115
Too crazy to pick up the phone, huh ?

05:09.083 --> 05:10.373
Hey, what's up ?

05:10.683 --> 05:12.334
Ryan Wolfe. Detective John Hagen.

05:12.694 --> 05:14.059
Oh, Hagen. You're, uh...

05:14.108 --> 05:15.449
you're Ray Caine's old partner.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.104
Yeah.

05:18.215 --> 05:19.531
That was me.

05:19.965 --> 05:21.342
I'll see you around, Calleigh.

05:21.369 --> 05:22.459
Okay.

05:25.338 --> 05:26.666
What was that about ?

05:27.454 --> 05:28.770
It's complicated.

05:29.825 --> 05:32.418
- He's been on IOD.
- Injured on duty ?

05:33.113 --> 05:34.266
What was the problem ?

05:34.266 --> 05:35.954
I don't know.
Something about a bad back.

05:37.009 --> 05:38.672
Yeah, I heard that one before.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.387
What's that supposed to mean ?

05:41.181 --> 05:42.298
Nothing.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.589
You can tell me.

05:45.590 --> 05:47.154
Couple guys I knew in patrol,

05:47.154 --> 05:49.896
"bad back" meant they couldn't get cleared by the department shrink.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.345
Excuse me.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.725
In the hat, excuse me.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.244
Step away from the bags, please.

06:31.256 --> 06:32.795
It's all right. These belong to me.

06:33.006 --> 06:35.677
The bags are evidence in a plane crash, sir.

06:35.681 --> 06:38.284
- Please step away...
- Yeah, I know. I own the plane.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.811
Sean Walsh,

06:39.823 --> 06:42.759
Air-Away Freight Systems.
I'm just collecting my cargo.

06:42.789 --> 06:45.708
Mr. Walsh, looting is a felony.

06:45.916 --> 06:47.458
Step away from the bags.

06:49.394 --> 06:50.936
Look, if I don't get these checks

06:50.936 --> 06:53.094
to Atlanta under deadline,

06:53.353 --> 06:55.043
a couple local banks are going under.

06:55.384 --> 06:56.889
How much was on the plane ?

06:57.284 --> 06:58.369
$1.2 billion.

06:58.369 --> 07:02.221
- Excuse me ?
- 1.2 billion in checks

07:02.291 --> 07:05.066
mortgages, car loans, company payrolls.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.687
Every day, every check that's written

07:07.711 --> 07:09.402
has got to be physically moved to a bank.

07:09.783 --> 07:11.127
Freight dogs move them.

07:11.337 --> 07:14.161
- Freight dogs ?
- Yep. That's what we call ourselves.

07:14.494 --> 07:16.122
Ain't exactly a glamour business.

07:16.124 --> 07:18.270
The bags stay here.

07:25.543 --> 07:27.097
All right, look. I know how this works.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.033
- What's it gonna take ?
- I suggest you leave now,

07:30.033 --> 07:32.859
or you will be placed
under arrest. It's up to you.

07:38.451 --> 07:39.807
You're the man.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.319
The controller said the cargo jet

07:43.331 --> 07:45.946
was heading southeast on runway nine right.

07:46.217 --> 07:47.561
Well, there it is right there.

07:51.740 --> 07:53.134
The pilot says he was climbing.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.769
Hold on. Freeze it right there.

08:00.258 --> 08:01.541
That's it.

08:01.874 --> 08:04.231
That's where he lost control.
The jet was banking left.

08:04.686 --> 08:07.140
Well, lasers travel in a straight line, so...

08:07.888 --> 08:10.429
I can extrapolate a probable line of sight

08:10.713 --> 08:13.043
from the cockpit window to the ground.

08:15.263 --> 08:17.619
Gets us down to six blocks in the Gables.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.964
Laser guy was standing in that perimeter.

08:21.296 --> 08:22.603
Or living there.

08:25.501 --> 08:26.932
It's about time you guys got here.

08:27.671 --> 08:29.164
I've been keeping a log.

08:29.287 --> 08:30.644
You're keeping a log?

08:30.644 --> 08:33.284
Now, they're supposed to be restricting
takeoffs over the neighborhood between

08:33.284 --> 08:35.847
12:00 and 6:00 a.m. But
I've been hearing jet engines

08:35.885 --> 08:37.698
every night this week after midnight.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.970
That's not why we're here.

08:40.537 --> 08:41.844
Unbelievable.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.174
What is it gonna take for you people
to start paying attention?

08:45.787 --> 08:49.018
Mr. Stamler, we are aware of the fact
that you've filed numerous complaints

08:49.018 --> 08:51.040
against Miami International Airport,

08:51.040 --> 08:52.920
and that you're the leader
of a group called

08:52.920 --> 08:55.140
Citizens for Quiet Skies.

08:55.310 --> 08:56.610
I'm a community activist.

08:56.611 --> 08:58.116
Yes, and it's come to our attention,

08:58.116 --> 09:00.545
Mr. Stamler, that you've
threatened to bring down a plane.

09:01.766 --> 09:04.356
Miami International recorded
a conversation last week.

09:04.905 --> 09:06.335
Like I told the police then,

09:06.335 --> 09:07.655
it was just talk.

09:07.655 --> 09:09.033
I wanted to be taken seriously.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.092
Well, a cargo jet crashed this morning.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.794
Is that serious enough for you?

09:13.004 --> 09:14.311
Well, it's like I've been saying, that

09:14.373 --> 09:16.173
flight path is a threat to the whole neighborhood.

09:21.596 --> 09:23.483
It appears that the threat...

09:24.984 --> 09:26.896
has come a little closer to home.

09:30.719 --> 09:32.039
What do you mean?

09:34.872 --> 09:36.339
This is what I mean.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.088
This is a green-diode laser.

09:40.286 --> 09:41.938
I bought it on-line. It's not illegal.

09:42.342 --> 09:44.478
It is if you use it to bring down an airplane.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.585
- This is a joke, right?
- I can assure you this is no joke.

09:47.585 --> 09:50.408
You used this to blind the pilots on that plane.

09:58.887 --> 10:00.367
I was just trying to make a point.

10:00.515 --> 10:02.661
You did, and now you're under arrest.

10:03.484 --> 10:05.569
All I ever wanted was to live
in a quiet neighborhood.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.971
Yes, well, Mr. Stamler,

10:07.049 --> 10:08.475
you just got your wish.

10:26.156 --> 10:27.970
I didn't think these planes carried cash.

10:28.032 --> 10:32.280
They don't. Legally, the only thing they're
allowed to transport are checks.

10:32.388 --> 10:34.388
I found a bunch of cash already.

10:34.538 --> 10:38.166
This whole operation's looking very shifty.
I'm gonna take this back to the lab.

10:38.352 --> 10:39.716
Want my help ?

10:40.212 --> 10:42.522
Absolutely. It's your investigation, too.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.778
Calleigh !

11:03.630 --> 11:04.948
I'll call Rescue.

11:06.740 --> 11:07.846
No. No need.

11:09.163 --> 11:10.718
Think she was an innocent bystander ?

11:11.333 --> 11:13.166
Her body's not crushed.

11:13.201 --> 11:14.673
Looks like she was
thrown from the plane.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.935
The pilot didn't say anything
about having a passenger, did he ?

11:16.970 --> 11:18.363
He was pretty shaken up.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.065
Look at the way she's dressed.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.024
Party girl on a cargo flight ?
Something is definitely hinky.

11:24.605 --> 11:25.505
Start with her eyes.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.671
They're different colors,
one blue, one green.

11:28.341 --> 11:29.398
Heterochromia ?

11:29.433 --> 11:31.398
I think there's a simpler explanation.

11:36.578 --> 11:37.892
It's a colored contact lens.

11:39.634 --> 11:40.852
It's Dior Blue.

11:43.647 --> 11:44.909
The other one's missing.

11:45.708 --> 11:47.789
You call Alexx.
I'm gonna find Horatio.

11:51.768 --> 11:52.809
Hey.

11:52.844 --> 11:54.717
We found a DB at the crash site.

11:54.752 --> 11:55.875
Female passenger.

11:57.290 --> 12:00.249
But it wasn't a passenger plane.
Was she killed in the crash ?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.193
Her liver temp was 87 degrees.

12:02.228 --> 12:05.253
The body core temperature drops
two degrees the first hour,

12:05.288 --> 12:07.365
a single degree after that, right ?

12:07.400 --> 12:08.989
Which puts her time
of death at midnight.

12:09.224 --> 12:11.019
She was dead before they
put her on the plane.

12:11.842 --> 12:14.075
- Where is she now ?
- Alexx is posting her.

12:14.110 --> 12:15.375
Do you want me to talk to the pilot ?

12:15.410 --> 12:16.903
Not yet. We've got the body.

12:16.938 --> 12:18.343
Let's see what that tells, all right ?

12:18.378 --> 12:19.137
All right.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.448
Alexx,

12:22.483 --> 12:24.428
anything on the girl from the cargo jet ?

12:24.463 --> 12:26.850
Well, the good news is we've got an ID :

12:26.885 --> 12:28.851
Caitlyn Townsend, 20,

12:28.886 --> 12:30.144
Bal Harbour society girl.

12:30.179 --> 12:32.504
Family made their fortune
in the citrus industry.

12:32.539 --> 12:33.647
What's the bad news ?

12:33.682 --> 12:35.965
ID came from her family's lawyers.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.213
They've filed an injunction
preventing us from doing an autopsy.

12:39.248 --> 12:41.674
Well, any suspicious death requires one.

12:41.709 --> 12:42.943
They have no legal standing.

12:42.978 --> 12:44.695
Well, the judge will go our way,

12:44.730 --> 12:47.021
but they'll tie it up in the
court for at least a week.

12:47.056 --> 12:48.473
I can't cut her until then.

12:48.508 --> 12:50.478
And the trail will go cold. Options ?

12:50.513 --> 12:51.838
Talk to the family.

12:52.446 --> 12:54.157
See what their objections are.

12:54.392 --> 12:56.099
Or see what they're hiding.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.023
Chairs go around the back.

13:04.808 --> 13:06.649
Champagne goes in the subzero.

13:06.684 --> 13:08.856
Flowers go on the table by the pool.

13:10.278 --> 13:11.152
May I help you ?

13:11.620 --> 13:13.415
Yeah, we'd like to
speak to Mrs. Townsend.

13:13.450 --> 13:15.189
I'm Heidi Dillon, her assistant.

13:15.224 --> 13:17.339
She's not taking visitors right now.

13:17.673 --> 13:18.739
Her daughter passed away.

13:18.774 --> 13:21.082
Her daughter's death is
why we're here, Miss Dillon.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.834
Any idea why she was on the cargo plane ?

13:23.869 --> 13:26.554
No. It doesn't make any sense to me.

13:26.789 --> 13:30.806
Is the family having a
wake at the house already ?

13:30.841 --> 13:32.956
Caitlin ran a charity
for troubled girls.

13:32.991 --> 13:35.156
This is their big fund-raising weekend.

13:35.191 --> 13:37.587
And you carry on even
after the chairwoman's dead ?

13:38.537 --> 13:40.619
This charity was Caitlin's legacy.

13:41.843 --> 13:43.917
She dedicated her life to these girls.

13:46.363 --> 13:48.124
Can't even really believe she's gone.

13:49.447 --> 13:51.186
Could I speak to her mother, please ?

13:54.222 --> 13:55.631
Okay.

14:06.872 --> 14:08.257
Mrs. Townsend...

14:12.151 --> 14:13.926
Ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

14:16.685 --> 14:19.369
I understand that you
oppose the autopsy.

14:19.404 --> 14:21.865
I don't see any point of
putting my daughter through that.

14:22.607 --> 14:24.034
The plane crash killed her.

14:24.069 --> 14:25.953
I don't believe that's the case.

14:30.848 --> 14:31.649
What do you mean ?

14:31.684 --> 14:34.695
I'm not sure yet, and
that's why I need your help.

14:39.039 --> 14:40.649
No, she's suffered enough.

14:42.170 --> 14:43.209
Ma'am ?

14:47.238 --> 14:49.991
Caitlyn had a heroin addiction.

14:51.253 --> 14:53.105
Dropped her down to 90 pounds.

14:53.973 --> 14:57.487
You understand that the court will
authorize the autopsy in a few days

14:57.522 --> 14:58.725
that's state law.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.126
Please.

15:01.805 --> 15:04.419
Please don't cut my daughter open.

15:06.355 --> 15:08.938
She's at peace now.
Can't you just let her be ?

15:14.599 --> 15:18.605
Ma'am, maybe there's a way we
can preserve that peace, okay ?

15:21.283 --> 15:22.667
A virtopsy.

15:22.702 --> 15:25.996
A virtual autopsy is not
covered in the injunction.

15:27.355 --> 15:29.949
Any excuse to try something new.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.541
Most of the injuries are
commensurate with the plane crash.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.697
Broken bones,

16:09.732 --> 16:12.728
but no bleeding or bruising in
the muscle tissue surrounding them.

16:12.990 --> 16:15.113
Meaning they broke postmortem.

16:15.148 --> 16:19.540
Yeah. But Mrs. Townsend
did us quite a favor.

16:19.575 --> 16:22.082
Look at her lungs. They're saturated.

16:22.117 --> 16:23.200
See those spots ?

16:23.235 --> 16:24.849
Indicate aspiration.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.565
If we'd cut into her,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.052
the pressure in the
lungs might have released,

16:29.876 --> 16:31.486
and we might never have found it.

16:31.521 --> 16:32.821
Found what, Alexx ?

16:32.856 --> 16:34.865
Caitlyn Townsend drowned.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.009
In what, I can't tell yet.

16:37.044 --> 16:39.405
Maybe I can help there.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.190
Mr. Rydell.

16:43.225 --> 16:45.164
Eric Delko, Crime Lab.

16:45.199 --> 16:47.227
Glad to see you're out of surgery.

16:48.473 --> 16:50.519
Yeah, I'm going to have pins
in my leg the rest of my life.

16:50.554 --> 16:53.052
It's better than your copilot.
He's still unconscious.

16:53.087 --> 16:56.203
Yeah. Man, I can't
believe this happened.

16:56.238 --> 16:58.354
Talk to me. What did happen, exactly ?

16:58.589 --> 17:00.390
How did Caitlyn Townsend die ?

17:01.301 --> 17:03.260
Uh, Caitlyn Townsend ?

17:03.295 --> 17:04.907
She was a passenger on your flight.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.425
What, you're telling me
there was a girl on the plane ?

17:07.461 --> 17:08.968
Yeah, a dead girl.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.824
Hey, man, I don't know
anything about that.

17:13.059 --> 17:17.130
Swap-outs happen on these routes so
fast, checks are in and out in 60 seconds.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.676
So, she came on with the bag of checks ?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.097
Listen, pit stops, I'm
maintaining the plane.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.442
Copilot's in charge of cargo.

17:30.477 --> 17:32.372
And conveniently, he's in a coma.

17:34.201 --> 17:36.386
Look, man, I'm telling you the truth.

17:36.421 --> 17:38.430
All right, check the freight manifest.

17:38.465 --> 17:39.280
I will.

17:39.515 --> 17:41.896
And if you're lying, well,

17:41.931 --> 17:43.720
I know where to find you.

17:56.386 --> 17:57.657
Think we'll get a print ?

17:58.554 --> 18:00.058
I certainly hope so.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.079
So, Calliegh...

18:06.096 --> 18:07.575
I wanted to talk to you.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.609
Calleigh Duquesne ?

18:12.611 --> 18:14.530
Mr. Elliot.

18:15.476 --> 18:17.454
Peter Elliott, Secret Service.

18:17.489 --> 18:18.752
Detective John Hagen.

18:18.787 --> 18:19.607
How you doing ?

18:20.191 --> 18:21.097
So, how can I help you ?

18:21.132 --> 18:23.720
Well, anytime this much
cash shows up, so do I.

18:23.955 --> 18:25.552
Oh, yeah, I was wondering
why I didn't see you

18:25.553 --> 18:27.149
on that counterfeiting
thing a couple weeks back.

18:27.184 --> 18:28.387
I worked it with Horatio.

18:29.232 --> 18:31.466
And I do not even rate a hello ?

18:31.666 --> 18:32.575
I came by.

18:32.610 --> 18:33.510
You weren't here.

18:34.972 --> 18:37.397
This is all the money you
recovered from the plane site ?

18:37.432 --> 18:38.517
Mm-hmm.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.882
Freshly bundled cash like this has to be
a special request from the Federal Reserve.

18:42.917 --> 18:43.679
Okay.

18:44.014 --> 18:45.279
You see this number here ?

18:45.314 --> 18:48.480
That tells us which Federal
Reserve issued this bundle.

18:48.515 --> 18:49.959
E5 is Richmond,

18:49.994 --> 18:52.489
so I just enter a serial number,

18:52.524 --> 18:55.280
and with my very high
security clearance...

18:56.303 --> 19:01.037
Bingo. Cash was requested by a Hamilton
Solomon, Biscayne Mutual in Miami.

19:01.472 --> 19:02.721
Great. I'll drive.

19:02.756 --> 19:04.351
John, I'll talk to you later.

19:04.386 --> 19:05.088
Okay.

19:05.123 --> 19:06.153
Nice to meet you.

19:18.939 --> 19:22.339
Mr. Solomon, you
requested $500,000 in cash

19:22.374 --> 19:23.619
from the Federal Reserve.

19:23.654 --> 19:25.083
Who was it for ?

19:26.616 --> 19:30.217
We honor this type of
request for special clients.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.824
And who was so special this time ?

19:33.691 --> 19:35.279
Caitlyn Townsend.

19:35.314 --> 19:37.258
She had a fund-raiser last night.

19:37.293 --> 19:38.605
Big donors write her checks,

19:38.640 --> 19:39.805
I turn them into cash.

19:42.947 --> 19:45.183
Half a million dollars in cash ?
You don't find that suspicious ?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.116
I assume that money goes
back into the charity.

19:48.151 --> 19:51.270
How do you suppose the cash ended up on
a cargo jet that crashed this morning ?

19:51.305 --> 19:52.893
I have no idea.

19:52.928 --> 19:54.631
Couriers took the cash out...

20:01.355 --> 20:02.432
like always.

20:02.928 --> 20:03.931
"Always" ?

20:04.410 --> 20:06.767
So, this is not the first time ?

20:06.802 --> 20:09.814
As I said, Caitlyn is
a very special client.

20:11.786 --> 20:13.427
Caitlyn is dead, Mr. Solomon.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.225
What ?

20:14.752 --> 20:16.912
We'd like to see those
charity checks, please.

20:45.523 --> 20:46.692
They're perfect.

20:46.727 --> 20:47.695
All properly endorsed.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.575
I checked the signatures myself.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.462
Actually, I don't think
she signed them at all.

21:11.341 --> 21:12.632
Afternoon, gentlemen.

21:12.667 --> 21:13.757
Mrs. Townsend,

21:13.792 --> 21:15.931
your daughter's charity
was for runaway girls.

21:16.698 --> 21:18.450
Your models are wearing bikinis.

21:18.897 --> 21:20.827
This event's been
scheduled for over a year.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.777
Because that's the way
Caitlyn wanted it, right ?

21:23.812 --> 21:25.701
I'm honoring my daughter's wishes.

21:25.736 --> 21:27.445
Can I help you with anything else ?

21:27.480 --> 21:31.204
Yes, I'm anxious to hear about
her account at Biscayne Mutual.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.906
I don't handle the finances.
Was it charity-related ?

21:34.941 --> 21:35.939
In theory.

21:35.974 --> 21:37.740
Then you'll have to
talk with Nick Marshall.

21:38.419 --> 21:40.674
He co-chairs the
foundation with Caitlyn.

21:40.709 --> 21:42.553
And where would we find Mr. Marshall ?

21:42.588 --> 21:44.184
He's in the office.

21:45.183 --> 21:47.599
Through the bikinis. Perfect.

22:00.062 --> 22:02.377
Taking a pass on your
own party, Mr. Marshall ?

22:02.412 --> 22:03.720
I'm not much in the mood.

22:04.205 --> 22:05.310
You understand.

22:06.073 --> 22:07.835
How close were you
with Caitlyn ?

22:08.089 --> 22:11.443
I met Caitlyn when she wasn't all that
different from the girls we're helping.

22:11.522 --> 22:12.951
I was her counselor.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.877
She asked me to help
run her foundation.

22:14.988 --> 22:17.654
Caitlyn's signatures on
these foundation checks

22:17.781 --> 22:19.320
are perfectly uniform.

22:20.289 --> 22:22.852
And nobody signs their name
the same way twice,

22:23.439 --> 22:24.729
let alone 100 times.

22:24.872 --> 22:26.237
I noticed that,

22:26.713 --> 22:28.808
you have a check
signing machine over there.

22:28.919 --> 22:32.316
Caitlyn's wrist cramped up
endorsing all those checks.

22:33.531 --> 22:34.896
I've seen these before.

22:46.643 --> 22:49.722
User puts any kind of writing
instrument into the machine.

22:51.468 --> 22:52.706
Its nib...

22:53.539 --> 22:55.428
hooks into a signature matrix.

22:56.682 --> 22:59.222
The matrix template turns
and guides the pen.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.496
A letter-perfect signature every time.

23:10.655 --> 23:12.845
To answer your next question,
the only person with

23:12.925 --> 23:15.718
access to that machine
other than Caitlyn was me.

23:15.997 --> 23:18.013
I'm not surprised.
So, you endorsed the checks,

23:18.060 --> 23:21.806
turned them into cash and attempted
to transport them out of the state.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.385
I'm not embezzling
from my own charity.

23:29.358 --> 23:30.684
Give me a name.

23:31.779 --> 23:33.445
No, I won't hurt this foundation.

23:33.556 --> 23:36.096
Or risk losing the trust of
the girls we're trying to help.

23:36.175 --> 23:37.778
How civic-minded of you.

23:44.617 --> 23:45.775
What's that ?

23:45.807 --> 23:48.918
It's a signature matrix
from a signing machine.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.001
Where'd you get it ?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.239
Nick Marshall, Caitlyn Townsend's partner.

23:52.350 --> 23:53.644
Cool. Let's have a look.

24:30.324 --> 24:32.990
That's Heidi Dillon,
the mother's assistant.

24:33.355 --> 24:35.022
Runaway, theft,

24:35.292 --> 24:36.943
fraud, drug possession.

24:38.233 --> 24:40.729
Guess she's one of the charity's
success stories.

24:41.015 --> 24:42.332
Why are your prints

24:42.514 --> 24:44.554
on Caitlyn's signature matrix, Heidi ?

24:44.800 --> 24:47.086
Cause she asked me to set up
the machine for her.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.566
Detective Salas looked
into your background.

24:50.376 --> 24:51.852
You rehabbed at FutureMore

24:51.947 --> 24:53.868
at the same time as Caitlyn Townsend.

24:54.074 --> 24:55.931
Yeah, we looked out
for one another.

24:56.527 --> 25:00.321
Caitlyn had everything, and even with all
that money, she still ended up on the street.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.242
So, she got you a job
when you got out ?

25:02.344 --> 25:04.424
Yes. She talked her mom
into hiring me.

25:04.535 --> 25:06.884
And you repaid the kindness
by stealing from them ?

25:07.059 --> 25:08.424
I didn't steal,

25:08.507 --> 25:11.253
I set up Caitlyn's machine.
She wasn't mechanical.

25:12.817 --> 25:14.928
Where'd you get those
cuts on your arms ?

25:15.182 --> 25:17.753
Um, from picking up palm fronds
in the back yard.

25:18.508 --> 25:22.047
Are you sure you didn't have
an altercation with Caitlyn last night ?

25:22.642 --> 25:23.944
You think I killed her ?

25:24.912 --> 25:26.119
Did you ?

25:26.706 --> 25:28.833
That's your job to figure out, isn't it ?

25:47.932 --> 25:49.123
Can I help you ?

25:49.186 --> 25:51.821
Looking for evidence of a
cat fight under her nails.

25:51.853 --> 25:53.123
I already scraped.

25:53.170 --> 25:54.488
Didn't find anything.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.702
But I do have a copy of
Caitlyn Townsend's tox report.

25:57.749 --> 25:59.607
- Was she back on drugs ?
- No.

25:59.702 --> 26:05.286
The girl was clean. But substance we suctioned
out of her lungs had high levels of glucose.

26:05.842 --> 26:08.350
Could be some sort of soda,

26:08.715 --> 26:09.921
vitamin water.

26:10.048 --> 26:11.334
Or champagne.

26:11.774 --> 26:14.203
Caitlyn's fund-raiser
last night was at Rev,

26:14.330 --> 26:16.108
the new club on Collin Street.

26:17.282 --> 26:19.409
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- Little late.

26:19.488 --> 26:21.727
Horatio sent Calleigh and Delko.

26:35.239 --> 26:37.826
Must have been only the high rollers
in here last night.

26:37.969 --> 26:40.386
The lower the profile,
the bigger the check.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.172
Take a look at this.

26:45.219 --> 26:46.521
Champagne bowl.

26:46.965 --> 26:48.720
There's something floating in it.

27:01.414 --> 27:03.478
That's Dior blue if I've ever seen one.

27:14.395 --> 27:16.077
This is our primary crime scene.

27:23.343 --> 27:24.645
I found hair.

27:31.296 --> 27:34.597
Signs of a struggle.
It looks like Caitlyn gave one last pull.

27:36.232 --> 27:37.550
Got something else.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.089
Print from some kind
of work boot.

27:40.939 --> 27:43.654
And not the kind you'd wear
to an event like this.

27:44.082 --> 27:45.955
Let's find out who crashed this party.

27:58.082 --> 27:59.400
Excuse me ?

28:00.058 --> 28:01.392
Can I help you, ma'am ?

28:02.392 --> 28:04.534
I'm Calleigh Duquesne
with the Crime Lab.

28:04.630 --> 28:06.344
What's in the bags, Mr. Walsh ?

28:07.622 --> 28:08.940
What else ?

28:09.075 --> 28:10.297
Checks.

28:10.868 --> 28:12.202
No bodies this time ?

28:14.627 --> 28:16.563
This is about that girl y'all found.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.274
I heard about it.

28:19.122 --> 28:20.457
I wish I could help you.

28:21.035 --> 28:22.702
Be careful what you wish for.

28:25.210 --> 28:27.035
Now, I don't know
what you mean by that.

28:27.131 --> 28:28.464
I think you do.

28:28.685 --> 28:30.460
We found this at the crime scene,

28:30.635 --> 28:31.840
Club Rev.

28:32.046 --> 28:37.978
Our lab found aviation grade hydraulic fluid,
and my guess is you were there, and this
is a match to your boot.

28:38.461 --> 28:40.110
You want to save me the trouble ?

28:43.280 --> 28:44.383
Look.

28:45.381 --> 28:46.602
Look, I got a call

28:46.681 --> 28:48.425
from Nick Marshall, late.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.438
Told he had one more package for me.

28:50.739 --> 28:52.340
And you didn't ask questions ?

28:52.550 --> 28:54.421
I showed up, she's just lying there.

29:12.488 --> 29:17.133
And then what was gonna happen ?
One of your pilots was gonna
dump her over the Atlantic ?

29:17.973 --> 29:19.959
Look, I don't mean any disrespect,

29:21.053 --> 29:22.955
but that dead body is just freight.

29:23.035 --> 29:26.022
There's no law against transporting her.

29:28.749 --> 29:30.548
Did Nick Marshall tell you
who killed her ?

29:30.627 --> 29:33.195
No. Just told me that
he needed it cleaned up.

29:35.763 --> 29:39.113
Well, unfortunately for you, Mr. Walsh,
that is against the law.

29:40.496 --> 29:42.129
It's called being an accessory.

29:51.688 --> 29:56.412
Sean Walsh says you helped
him dispose of Caitlyn's body.

29:57.719 --> 29:58.987
Look...

30:00.018 --> 30:02.237
she went all Single White Female on me.

30:02.554 --> 30:03.965
- Caitlyn did ?
- No,

30:04.282 --> 30:05.432
Heidi Dillon.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.869
You know what they say.
You can take the girl out of juvie, but, uh...

30:13.916 --> 30:15.232
Heidi Dillon.

30:17.491 --> 30:19.076
That how you hurt your hand ?

30:19.250 --> 30:20.312
Yeah.

30:22.001 --> 30:24.046
No good deed goes
unpunished, right ?

30:24.268 --> 30:25.425
That's what they say.

30:26.988 --> 30:29.086
What are you doing ? Come on.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.889
What-What have I done ?
What have I done ?

30:36.350 --> 30:37.606
Is she dead ?

30:38.623 --> 30:41.389
I think so. You got to get out of here.
Come on, get out of here.

30:42.855 --> 30:45.461
So you called your friend
instead of the authorities.

30:45.604 --> 30:48.004
People find out one
of my girls killed Caitlyn...

30:48.072 --> 30:49.153
Well,

30:49.534 --> 30:52.157
charities don't really recover
from publicity like that.

30:52.363 --> 30:53.698
You may not, either.

30:56.838 --> 30:58.380
Hey, John. How's it going ?

30:58.713 --> 31:00.907
Maybe I should ask you
the same question.

31:02.171 --> 31:03.474
What do you mean ?

31:03.999 --> 31:06.351
What's with you and
the Secret Service guy ?

31:07.388 --> 31:08.691
We're colleagues.

31:08.819 --> 31:10.503
Not that it's any of your business.

31:10.892 --> 31:12.625
I can make it my business.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.977
Walk away, John.

31:15.033 --> 31:16.336
Are you sleeping with him ?

31:16.431 --> 31:17.845
This conversation is over.

31:19.992 --> 31:21.629
What if I don't want it to be over ?

31:21.725 --> 31:24.284
Then you better remember
what I do for a living.

31:25.003 --> 31:26.274
Calleigh...

31:50.592 --> 31:52.134
Hey, I got your message.

31:52.468 --> 31:55.170
Have the results on that
hair from the crime scene.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.500
Almost all the roots had tags.
Must have been some fight.

31:58.643 --> 32:00.407
Yeah, it was a fight to the death.

32:00.948 --> 32:03.971
- What did you find ?
- DNA matches Heidi Dillon.

32:05.338 --> 32:07.932
Confirms Nick's story.
Mind if I keep this?

32:07.990 --> 32:09.146
Is there a problem?

32:09.629 --> 32:11.048
Something's not adding up.

32:11.136 --> 32:12.439
I'm finished with them.

32:55.555 --> 32:58.457
So, what's the deal? You guys
are gonna arraign me or not?

32:58.760 --> 33:00.123
You can drop the act, Heidi.

33:00.235 --> 33:02.075
Oh, like I've never
heard that before.

33:02.163 --> 33:04.080
We know
where Caitlyn was murdered.

33:04.373 --> 33:06.977
And we found your hair there.
DNA confirms it.

33:07.503 --> 33:08.112
And?

33:08.405 --> 33:09.176
And I ran some tests

33:09.177 --> 33:10.835
to see if you were
on anything at the time.

33:11.103 --> 33:11.919
I'm clean.

33:12.031 --> 33:12.930
I swear to God.

33:12.994 --> 33:14.600
I have been
since I got off the street.

33:14.601 --> 33:15.318
I know.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.792
Only aberration was
a marked increase

33:17.793 --> 33:19.542
of folic acid.

33:21.152 --> 33:22.634
You're pregnant, aren't you ?

33:25.947 --> 33:27.414
About ten weeks.

33:28.162 --> 33:29.659
Who's the father ?

33:31.243 --> 33:32.461
Nick Marshall.

33:33.485 --> 33:35.245
Is that what you
and Caitlyn were fighting over ?

33:35.246 --> 33:35.973
Fighting ?

33:36.596 --> 33:37.925
Your hair, remember ?

33:38.796 --> 33:40.292
Look, I was freaking out.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.436
I'd just told Nick I was pregnant.

33:44.182 --> 33:44.941
Heidi ?

33:46.714 --> 33:47.600
What's wrong ?

33:47.968 --> 33:48.689
Nothing.

33:49.435 --> 33:50.343
Let me help you.

33:50.349 --> 33:51.196
I can't.

33:51.773 --> 33:52.994
I screwed up, Caitlyn.

33:54.843 --> 33:56.158
I really screwed up.

33:57.012 --> 33:57.961
What's the point ?

33:58.488 --> 34:00.021
You guys think I'm guilty, right ?

34:00.319 --> 34:00.814
Heidi,

34:01.820 --> 34:03.425
pregnant women take folic acid

34:03.426 --> 34:05.891
to prevent birth defects in their babies.

34:05.966 --> 34:06.670
I know.

34:07.074 --> 34:07.690
So ?

34:07.922 --> 34:09.418
It means you care about this child.

34:09.418 --> 34:11.371
Why take the fall for murder ?

34:13.833 --> 34:16.300
'Cause I'll just end up here anyway.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.303
Or is it because you're scared ?

34:20.598 --> 34:21.355
Yeah.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.636
You know, you know so much--
tell me what else I am.

34:26.149 --> 34:27.478
No, that's it.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.007
You're just scared.

34:37.179 --> 34:39.610
I'm not gonna deny
I had a relationship with Heidi.

34:39.701 --> 34:41.492
She's 19. We were consenting adults.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.547
Till you found out she was pregnant.

34:44.338 --> 34:46.103
You didn't consent to that, did you ?

34:46.524 --> 34:48.012
I'll take a paternity test.

34:48.096 --> 34:50.485
If I'm the father, I'll honor
my financial obligations.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.925
With embezzled funds.

34:52.074 --> 34:52.985
Right, Nick ?

34:53.851 --> 34:55.431
I didn't embezzle any money.

34:55.514 --> 34:56.437
Heidi did that.

34:56.589 --> 34:58.396
That's a rather sophisticated move

34:58.397 --> 34:59.486
for a 19 year old.

34:59.487 --> 35:02.493
You sure you didn't put her up to it
and allowed her to take the risk ?

35:02.972 --> 35:04.184
If she got help,

35:05.071 --> 35:06.544
it wasn't from me.

35:07.304 --> 35:08.906
The cash on the plane--

35:09.067 --> 35:10.832
you figure out
where that money was going,

35:10.833 --> 35:12.447
you'll find out
what you're looking for.

35:19.063 --> 35:21.495
This flight plan says the cargo jet
was heading to Atlanta,

35:21.495 --> 35:22.983
loaded with mortgage checks.

35:23.272 --> 35:27.145
Not to mention all that embezzled cash
from Caitlyn Townsend's charity.

35:27.512 --> 35:28.915
Where do you think it was going ?

35:29.003 --> 35:29.690
A bank ?

35:29.778 --> 35:31.546
There's over a
thousand banks in Atlanta.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.548
This could take a while.

35:33.778 --> 35:35.741
Unless we're not looking
in the right place.

35:35.747 --> 35:37.836
It seems like Atlanta
wasn't the first stop.

35:37.841 --> 35:39.595
There was a secondary destination ?

35:41.651 --> 35:42.681
"CHS."

35:42.729 --> 35:44.538
It's an airport identification code.

35:44.629 --> 35:46.054
Charleston, South Carolina.

35:47.295 --> 35:50.543
Well, I bet they
didn't think we'd find that.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.519
What do you see ?

35:52.680 --> 35:53.911
Treasury database.

35:53.912 --> 35:56.929
Deposits over 10,000
have to be reported to the Feds.

35:57.625 --> 36:00.084
That's right. Anything under,
it doesn't raise a red flag.

36:00.155 --> 36:01.026
It does now-- banks track

36:01.027 --> 36:03.440
unusual deposit patterns under 10,000.

36:03.503 --> 36:04.476
When they find one,

36:04.549 --> 36:06.655
they file a Suspicious Activity Report.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.217
Hey, wait a minute. Check that out.

36:10.554 --> 36:12.282
The Pummelo Corporation.

36:12.985 --> 36:17.422
31 deposits, all cash.
All between $5,000 and $9,000.

36:17.950 --> 36:18.854
So?

36:18.887 --> 36:22.452
A pummelo is a large Asian fruit
with a thick outer skin.

36:22.541 --> 36:25.456
Wow, you really know your citrus.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.216
Thank you.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.838
So does Sophie Townsend.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.767
Her family made millions of dollars
in the Florida citrus industry.

36:36.114 --> 36:38.732
Lieutenant, I've told you
everything I can about my daughter.

36:38.802 --> 36:41.787
This is not about your daughter,
Mrs. Townsend. This is about you.

36:43.559 --> 36:45.136
Do I need to get a lawyer ?

36:45.319 --> 36:46.658
Something to think about.

36:47.190 --> 36:49.867
Why don't you tell us
about the Pummelo Corporation ?

36:52.459 --> 36:54.697
In my world, there are certain...

36:55.320 --> 36:56.915
expectations.

36:57.379 --> 36:59.600
The pressure to live up
to the family name.

36:59.743 --> 37:01.068
You have money.

37:02.895 --> 37:05.474
The citrus freeze two years ago ruined us.

37:05.475 --> 37:07.059
We were flat broke.

37:07.956 --> 37:12.456
My husband died, Caitlyn went back
into rehab, and I had to make choices.

37:12.470 --> 37:15.158
Choices as in looting
your daughter's charity,

37:15.358 --> 37:16.156
right ?

37:17.026 --> 37:18.551
You had Heidi Dillon

37:18.618 --> 37:20.962
do the dirty work.
She used a signing machine

37:20.967 --> 37:23.978
to forge Caitlyn's signature
onto the contribution checks.

37:24.179 --> 37:27.081
Turned them into cash and deposited
them in your Charleston account.

37:27.501 --> 37:29.304
Heidi only did what I asked her.

37:29.569 --> 37:30.658
How about murder ?

37:31.394 --> 37:32.400
Did she do that ?

37:32.987 --> 37:34.048
Lieutenant Caine,

37:34.865 --> 37:36.865
I have done some horrible things,

37:36.930 --> 37:39.024
but I did not kill my daughter.

37:39.452 --> 37:40.503
Then you will allow me

37:40.504 --> 37:44.203
to perform the formal autopsy
so I can figure out who did.

38:21.225 --> 38:22.996
Found this in the stomach contents.

38:22.997 --> 38:24.688
Number 11 cuspid.

38:24.781 --> 38:26.730
She swallowed her own tooth.

38:27.020 --> 38:28.861
Didn't show up in the Virtopsy.

38:29.175 --> 38:31.306
MRI doesn't read bones,

38:31.480 --> 38:32.274
only marrow.

38:32.563 --> 38:33.341
Alexx,

38:33.519 --> 38:35.479
you can't swallow after you're dead.

38:35.584 --> 38:36.241
Right.

38:36.501 --> 38:38.935
Means this tooth didn't
come out in the plane crash.

38:39.063 --> 38:41.359
It means she was hit
while she was still alive.

38:41.461 --> 38:43.144
It took a lot of force.

38:43.173 --> 38:44.480
She was hit hard.

38:44.839 --> 38:46.988
I doubt a female could have
landed that punch.

38:53.318 --> 38:55.130
Alexx, the thing about getting hit is

38:55.198 --> 38:57.556
the hitter receives a mark,
too, don't they ?

38:58.784 --> 38:59.900
Got anyone in mind ?

39:00.001 --> 39:02.630
No good deed goes unpunished.

39:06.297 --> 39:07.516
Let's get this thing airborne.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.872
I want to make it to Spider Key
while the sun's still up.

39:09.874 --> 39:10.215
Yes Sir.

39:10.388 --> 39:11.836
You going somewhere, Nick ?

39:13.675 --> 39:16.896
Taking a couple of days off.
I thought I'd head out to the Keys.

39:19.438 --> 39:21.552
I think you mean a short hop

39:21.556 --> 39:25.662
to a Caribbean country
with no extradition laws.

39:28.003 --> 39:29.533
You just don't quit, do you ?

39:29.579 --> 39:30.903
Not in my vocabulary.

39:31.931 --> 39:33.322
How many times
do I have to tell you ?

39:33.323 --> 39:35.253
I had nothing to do
with Caitlyn's death.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.295
The laceration on your hand
tells me otherwise.

39:39.296 --> 39:42.129
- It's just a scratch.
- It's a fight bite.

39:42.851 --> 39:46.125
The human mouth is loaded with bacteria.

39:55.528 --> 39:58.217
You're not making any sense.
Why would I do that to her?

39:58.696 --> 40:00.811
Heidi's unplanned pregnancy, Nick.

40:00.835 --> 40:03.907
You were supposed to protect
these girls. And Caitlyn found out.

40:05.899 --> 40:07.991
I can't believe this !
This is my charity !

40:08.037 --> 40:09.442
How many other girls
have you done this to ?!

40:09.442 --> 40:11.439
Caitlyn, you're overreacting.
Calm down.

40:12.301 --> 40:13.494
I am calm, Nick.

40:13.717 --> 40:15.179
You're fired.

40:15.285 --> 40:16.326
Are you kidding me ?

40:16.361 --> 40:18.421
When I first met you,
you were a junkie.

40:18.718 --> 40:21.234
I kicked heroin.
Now I'm kicking you.

40:21.721 --> 40:23.294
Don't you turn your back on me.

40:35.817 --> 40:37.127
She was a spoiled,

40:37.488 --> 40:40.482
little rich girl
with a $1,000-a-day habit.

40:40.853 --> 40:44.615
I introduced her to the right people,
I got her into the right parties.

40:44.724 --> 40:48.599
I worked my ass off for her.
No vacations, no overtime.

40:49.999 --> 40:53.528
I created Caitlyn Townsend.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.775
That didn't give you
the right to destroy her.

41:07.440 --> 41:07.879
Yeah ?

41:07.936 --> 41:09.703
You know that vacation
you never got ?

42:33.856 --> 42:35.593
You knew he killed Caitlyn,
didn't you ?

42:36.690 --> 42:38.221
You saw him.

42:38.610 --> 42:39.890
Why didn't you say anything ?

42:41.421 --> 42:42.381
I couldn't.

42:42.767 --> 42:44.522
So you were just gonna take the fall ?

42:44.952 --> 42:48.549
Nick just, you know, he gets so angry,
I just... I couldn't risk it.

42:50.336 --> 42:52.324
You were afraid he'd kill you.

42:53.851 --> 42:56.643
I was afraid he'd kill us.
