00:44.835 --> 00:46.710
<i>Inside these blocks,</i>

00:46.876 --> 00:49.043
<i>three hundred and fifty convicted terrorists</i>

00:49.210 --> 00:52.210
<i>are demanding political
rather than criminal status.</i>

00:52.585 --> 00:53.918
<i>They back this demand</i>

00:54.126 --> 00:56.293
<i>by what's called "The Dirty Protest."</i>

00:57.585 --> 00:59.460
<i>The men are not wearing clothes.</i>

00:59.793 --> 01:02.543
<i>They call them the "blanket men",
all they wear are blankets.</i>

01:04.126 --> 01:06.751
<i>The IRA is trying to force
the British government</i>

01:06.835 --> 01:09.168
<i>to grant the prisoners five demands</i>

01:09.251 --> 01:11.751
<i>using the weapon of last resort,
the hunger strike.</i>

01:13.168 --> 01:15.835
<i>There is no such thing as political murder,</i>

01:15.960 --> 01:18.460
<i>political bombing or political violence.</i>

01:19.418 --> 01:23.835
<i>There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:27.585
<i>Attitudes have hardened on both sides</i>

01:27.710 --> 01:29.960
<i>after the deaths of ten hunger-strikers.</i>

01:31.835 --> 01:35.335
<i>The decision to end the hunger
strike was taken last night.</i>

01:35.501 --> 01:39.918
<i>After visits from Republican leaders who
told them there was no point in going on.</i>

03:18.460 --> 03:19.585
For him.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.501
And you can stay over there Gordon,
they're short a body.

03:22.626 --> 03:24.251
Since when do we let them wear civvies?

03:24.335 --> 03:25.460
New rule.

03:25.835 --> 03:27.543
Which idiot decided that?

03:27.668 --> 03:29.460
Dunno, don't care.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.460
See ya, Gordon.

03:50.418 --> 03:52.126
What are you doing Larry?

03:53.918 --> 03:58.210
You're a traitor Larry Marley,
a fucking traitor!

04:03.918 --> 04:06.085
H7 first and then H2.

04:45.793 --> 04:47.710
Prisoner for transfer. Marley.

04:50.210 --> 04:51.293
Move.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.501
What do we have here?

04:57.626 --> 04:59.585
Look at the state of him.

05:01.210 --> 05:06.501
The blanket men are all mad they say,
but you don't look so scary. Does he?

05:06.585 --> 05:07.668
Like a mouse.

05:07.876 --> 05:10.126
Buried any of your IRA mates lately?

05:11.168 --> 05:12.835
What's that rumble I feel?

05:13.210 --> 05:15.026
Oh, I'm starving.

05:16.501 --> 05:17.960
You made the right choice.

05:19.668 --> 05:20.960
Twenty-eight.

05:22.835 --> 05:25.085
I don't see any of you going
on fucking hunger strike.

05:26.210 --> 05:27.460
Fucking "hard men"...

05:28.251 --> 05:29.793
Get back to your fucking cells.

05:30.168 --> 05:32.376
Stay up your own end, Loyalist bastards.

06:32.876 --> 06:34.085
What time do visits start?

06:35.335 --> 06:37.210
"What time do visits start, Sir."

06:42.335 --> 06:43.501
O'Shea.

06:44.335 --> 06:45.376
Marley.

06:45.835 --> 06:46.960
Delahunty.

06:47.543 --> 06:48.668
Feeney.

07:19.793 --> 07:22.751
I didn't know whether to believe it
when they said you were coming off.

07:24.085 --> 07:25.210
I'm glad you remember me.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.126
I almost didn't.

07:28.460 --> 07:30.210
- You look terrible.
- Yeah.

07:31.335 --> 07:33.585
You think this is bad,
you should have seen me before.

07:37.543 --> 07:38.710
I wanted to...

07:40.585 --> 07:41.918
All this time...

07:43.210 --> 07:44.335
I know...

07:45.335 --> 07:46.960
but the protest was important.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.335
How are the boys?

07:53.626 --> 07:54.793
Grand.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.960
Growing up fast without you.

08:00.835 --> 08:03.210
If things were different, Kate,
you know what I'd choose.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.168
Sorry about your friends

08:10.376 --> 08:11.626
on the hunger strike.

08:14.001 --> 08:15.251
It must have been bad in here.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.585
Sometimes...

08:24.418 --> 08:25.918
Sometimes I feel like a cheat,

08:29.126 --> 08:30.710
being alive when they're not.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.376
You know what I mean?

09:18.418 --> 09:21.043
Since the hunger strike ended,
everybody thinks we're finished.

09:21.126 --> 09:23.293
The bigger problem is that we do too.

09:23.668 --> 09:25.001
I mean, take a look at the men.

09:25.668 --> 09:29.460
We need to prove, not just to the world, but
ourselves too, that we've still got a pulse.

09:29.543 --> 09:30.710
What's on your mind?

09:32.376 --> 09:33.918
You don't mean an escape, surely?

09:35.918 --> 09:38.376
From here? You're joking, right?

09:41.376 --> 09:42.793
We don't even know where we are.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.460
I've been in here four years

09:44.543 --> 09:47.085
and I couldn't tell you
what's on the other side of that wall.

09:47.168 --> 09:48.918
Well it's time we found out, eh?

09:55.085 --> 09:56.626
Is it worth the risk?

09:57.293 --> 10:00.376
If they catch you making plans,
it'll be a few more years on your time.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.168
Why don't you ask the ten
hunger strikers if it's worth it.

10:06.251 --> 10:09.126
I owe it to them to at least try.

10:12.335 --> 10:13.751
You can do what you want for now.

10:14.626 --> 10:17.460
But believe me, you're wasting your time.

10:34.376 --> 10:36.043
Too many new faces round here, lads.

10:36.126 --> 10:38.751
You shoulda stayed on the blanket,
ya Fenian bastard.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.043
Youse better watch your backs. All of you.

10:45.501 --> 10:46.751
Is that right, Kenny boy?

10:48.626 --> 10:49.710
Take a look around.

10:51.501 --> 10:52.876
There's more of us than you now.

10:56.626 --> 10:57.876
Where the fuck's he going?

11:00.751 --> 11:02.626
Going for an afternoon stroll, Larry?

11:02.918 --> 11:06.460
Yep. Big date, your sister.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.126
Gordon about?

11:11.335 --> 11:12.376
Wait here.

11:16.793 --> 11:19.001
- What is it?
- I wanna volunteer for work...

11:19.710 --> 11:20.876
Orderly duty.

11:21.751 --> 11:23.918
You! The last of the blanket men!

11:24.543 --> 11:28.335
Couldn't stick being treated like a criminal
now all of a sudden you want to skivvy?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.918
My wife always said
I was a dab hand with a mop.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.126
No way. Forget it.

11:34.251 --> 11:36.001
Get many volunteers from our side, do you?

11:36.501 --> 11:39.085
I bet someone higher up would see it
different, wouldn't they?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.168
Maybe I should ask them.

11:45.876 --> 11:46.960
Bring him in here.

11:56.251 --> 11:59.251
I dunno about this.
I really don't think it's a good idea.

11:59.376 --> 12:02.001
What's the worst can happen?
The place might get a bit cleaner?

12:02.460 --> 12:03.710
All right. Let him in.

12:10.126 --> 12:11.626
I'm giving you one chance, Marley.

12:11.918 --> 12:13.876
Any funny business, and you're back in there.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.960
Drop of tea, Gordon?

13:14.751 --> 13:15.835
Fuck off!

13:21.210 --> 13:22.543
What are you playing at, Larry?

13:24.668 --> 13:26.543
I'm talking to you. We do not do scab labour.

13:26.668 --> 13:29.626
He's a Judas, that's what he is,
betraying the hunger strikers.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.126
You do not know me...

13:34.418 --> 13:35.793
Hey!

13:38.293 --> 13:40.710
Are you just going
to let him sell us out like that?

13:40.793 --> 13:42.168
You're his O.C., do something!

13:42.293 --> 13:44.626
If he wants to keep himself busy,
I'm not gonna stop him.

13:44.710 --> 13:46.210
But he's working for them!

13:46.710 --> 13:49.543
Our friends died so we wouldn't
have to do shit like that.

13:50.085 --> 13:51.626
We are political prisoners.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.251
- How can you just sit there?
- And I am your O.C. too, Joe

13:54.335 --> 13:55.918
and I'm asking you to stow it, okay?

14:16.460 --> 14:17.918
The thing is, I agree with him.

14:42.876 --> 14:45.251
No, I don't know what time...

14:46.793 --> 14:48.376
Just some of the other fellas.

14:55.501 --> 14:57.043
We went out last month.

14:59.085 --> 15:03.001
All right, we'll go out Saturday
just the three of us.

15:16.251 --> 15:17.585
A trolling spinner, isn't it?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.376
I used to do a bit myself.

15:28.376 --> 15:30.293
Prisoner Marley returning to the wing.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.710
You're sure it's the one you want,
not the blue one?

15:45.835 --> 15:47.585
No, it's perfect, thanks Dad.

15:47.710 --> 15:48.751
Just checking.

15:50.251 --> 15:51.460
So where do you want to eat?

15:52.001 --> 15:53.585
We're going to a restaurant too?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.626
Of course, it's called going out.

15:56.126 --> 15:57.335
I wouldn't know.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.293
Janet!

16:37.960 --> 16:39.126
Don't you move!

16:44.418 --> 16:45.793
You all right?

16:47.251 --> 16:48.335
Are you hurt?

16:54.585 --> 16:55.960
Message from your son.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.167
Come on.

17:14.001 --> 17:15.085
Get in.

17:19.501 --> 17:21.960
- Gordon not in today?
- Get in the fucking van!

17:22.085 --> 17:23.376
Ya Fenian scum!

17:33.418 --> 17:34.543
Right.

17:56.001 --> 17:58.876
Listen, my son's talking about
joining the family business.

17:59.501 --> 18:01.210
You want me to get someone to talk to him?

18:02.085 --> 18:03.210
No.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.251
He's mule-headed like me.

18:07.168 --> 18:09.501
If we tell him he can't,
he'll just find some other way.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.918
I need to be out there dealing with this.

18:12.668 --> 18:16.376
You do realise if you escape,
you won't be able to go home.

18:16.668 --> 18:17.835
Ever.

18:18.293 --> 18:20.668
They'll hunt you in every bush
and ditch in the country.

18:24.793 --> 18:26.918
Larry this is Bobby, Bobby, Larry.

18:28.335 --> 18:29.835
So, what have you got?

18:35.418 --> 18:36.626
Right.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.293
Well, what do you need?

18:39.376 --> 18:41.126
Detail. Lots of it.

18:41.876 --> 18:43.835
Eyes and ears. Anyone moving around,

18:43.918 --> 18:48.293
getting an x-ray, peeling spuds, whatever,
they need to remember what they see.

18:49.001 --> 18:51.126
- We'll get on it.
- What else?

18:52.501 --> 18:55.293
I need to find what they missed,
there has to be a flaw.

18:55.876 --> 18:57.210
Why? Because you want one?

18:59.043 --> 19:02.168
Meet my rain cloud,
it follows me around all day.

19:02.251 --> 19:05.251
You know they used to burn
unbelievers at the stake, Oscar.

19:05.376 --> 19:07.210
I'd love you to prove me wrong fellas.

19:08.043 --> 19:11.293
Our block is over here,
and there's another one right behind.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.543
How do you know that?

19:12.626 --> 19:14.126
I hear them out there in their yard.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.418
See? He's using his head.

19:18.126 --> 19:21.335
Now some smart bastard put sweat
and overtime into keeping us in here.

19:21.418 --> 19:23.626
We have to put a hell
of a lot more into getting out.

19:48.751 --> 19:50.876
There was a hit on your warder last night.

19:52.376 --> 19:53.543
He's alive.

19:54.043 --> 19:56.460
Jesus. Who the hell called that?

19:57.001 --> 19:58.251
It was an outside op.

19:59.001 --> 20:00.460
His wife and kid were there.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.335
Well that's just great!

20:03.001 --> 20:06.335
How am I supposed to get him to trust me
if we're trying to blow his brains out.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.043
You're wasting your time with that one.

20:08.251 --> 20:09.876
What do you need him for anyway?

20:17.335 --> 20:19.168
That's them finishing up now, Gordon.

20:37.251 --> 20:39.543
I told you this would happen, didn't I?

20:40.251 --> 20:41.501
I told you to quit.

20:41.626 --> 20:43.543
We can't let the bastards intimidate us,

20:43.626 --> 20:45.543
that's exactly what they want.

20:45.668 --> 20:46.793
Intimidate?

20:47.335 --> 20:49.460
Jesus, Gordon, we're lucky to be alive.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.460
Don't even think about going
back there, do you hear me?

20:57.376 --> 20:59.293
I am... I have to.

20:59.543 --> 21:01.251
No, you don't!

21:02.418 --> 21:05.751
Your brother was the hero, not you,
and look what happened to him.

21:08.918 --> 21:10.126
Come here.

21:47.793 --> 21:49.085
Santa Claus.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.126
Be quick.

22:02.460 --> 22:03.835
In, Marley.

22:08.835 --> 22:10.168
Where's my camera?

22:11.043 --> 22:12.626
Finally seeing the light, Brendan.

22:46.210 --> 22:49.043
- Nice shooting, Gordon.
- Good man, Gordon.

23:01.543 --> 23:04.126
Which one of you fuckers sent my name out?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.168
Come on, who was it?

23:09.918 --> 23:11.626
Anyone man enough to admit it?

23:13.876 --> 23:15.001
No?

23:17.043 --> 23:20.335
I didn't think so.
Too chicken shit the lot of you.

23:20.835 --> 23:23.501
You want us to sort them out for you,
Gordon? Just say the word.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.335
I don't want anything from you.

24:06.751 --> 24:08.043
I'm done.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.626
Prisoner Marley, returning to the wing.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.001
What happened to you
on the outside won't happen again.

24:31.293 --> 24:32.793
Why did you say that?

24:32.876 --> 24:34.793
You know something, you were in on it?

24:34.876 --> 24:37.960
No! You asked if it was
one of us in here. It wasn't.

24:38.168 --> 24:39.960
Who then? Give me names!

24:40.085 --> 24:41.960
I don't know who but it's finished.

24:42.585 --> 24:45.293
Warders won't be a target
any more, now the protest's over.

24:47.751 --> 24:49.210
Why did they go after me?

24:49.376 --> 24:51.293
Maybe you pissed off the wrong people.

24:52.001 --> 24:55.126
But it's true, you and your family
are safe. You can take my word for it.

24:57.501 --> 24:59.335
Your word. What's that worth?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.668
Why are you back here anyway, Gordon?

25:06.210 --> 25:07.918
Anyone with any sense would have quit.

25:08.210 --> 25:09.835
Because I don't scare so easy.

25:11.126 --> 25:13.126
Or maybe you're a prisoner
like the rest of us.

25:14.126 --> 25:15.418
I am not like you.

25:17.085 --> 25:19.126
I get to go home every night.

25:20.376 --> 25:22.001
Aye, that's right, so you do.

25:22.710 --> 25:23.960
Lucky.

25:25.126 --> 25:26.585
What's happening in there?

25:32.376 --> 25:33.585
You all right, son?

25:38.710 --> 25:40.043
Lovers' tiff?

25:44.668 --> 25:46.918
I'm beginning to have nightmares
about you, Marley.

25:57.001 --> 25:58.168
Hello.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.876
We saving electricity?

26:13.460 --> 26:14.876
Anyone home?

26:34.876 --> 26:37.335
<i>The most important thing
is that Janet is safe.</i>

26:37.626 --> 26:40.793
She'd be safe with me here too.
You both would!

26:41.335 --> 26:43.335
That thing that happened,
it was just a once off.

26:43.418 --> 26:45.751
<i>How can you say that, Gordon?
You don't know.</i>

26:45.835 --> 26:48.001
I do. One of them told me.

26:48.793 --> 26:50.835
<i>One of the prisoners told you?</i>

26:51.585 --> 26:54.585
<i>Is this a joke? Because it isn't funny.</i>

27:32.960 --> 27:34.418
You. Give me a hand.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.251
What did you hope to achieve
by bumping me off anyway?

27:44.210 --> 27:45.835
Stupid bastards.

27:47.085 --> 27:48.585
My brother I can understand.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.960
He was one tough nut.

27:52.085 --> 27:53.876
At least he died for something...

27:54.043 --> 27:57.251
Doing his duty, not like
those ten friends of yours.

27:58.126 --> 28:01.751
Suicide by starvation, spare me.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.668
And for what?

28:04.418 --> 28:06.085
So they wouldn't have to do prison work?

28:06.918 --> 28:08.251
You're doing it, aren't you?

28:08.418 --> 28:09.626
Big deal!

28:11.001 --> 28:12.501
Worth dying for, was it?

28:13.460 --> 28:15.835
Eh, was it?

28:20.751 --> 28:24.126
No, you're right. They were fools.

28:24.251 --> 28:25.668
Exactly.

28:26.501 --> 28:28.626
Big fucking T.V. show.

28:29.251 --> 28:30.751
They shoulda been like you,

28:31.460 --> 28:32.793
smart.

28:39.376 --> 28:40.751
We're doing this.

28:42.418 --> 28:44.585
I don't know how yet, but it's happening.

29:18.626 --> 29:19.960
All right, lads.

29:30.168 --> 29:31.543
Jesus, where did you get this?

29:32.085 --> 29:34.418
Would you believe, the T.V News.

29:35.376 --> 29:36.960
Shit, look at it...

29:38.876 --> 29:40.543
They really want to keep us in here.

29:41.126 --> 29:43.168
That's me and Brendan there, in H7.

29:43.626 --> 29:45.876
And that's you and Oscar, top left, in H2.

29:48.543 --> 29:49.918
We should be flattered, fellas.

29:51.085 --> 29:52.751
They made all this specially for us.

29:53.793 --> 29:57.710
You know, maybe we're wasting
our time looking for the weakest point.

29:58.585 --> 29:59.793
What if there isn't any?

30:00.710 --> 30:02.376
Look, here's a block.

30:02.710 --> 30:03.793
They're all the same,

30:04.460 --> 30:08.126
us prisoners in each of the four wings,
but in the middle, pulling the strings,

30:08.210 --> 30:09.668
are the warders in the circle.

30:09.835 --> 30:13.376
That there is the strongest point.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.210
- And this is good because?
- Because...

30:17.585 --> 30:19.210
Whoever controls the circle,

30:21.168 --> 30:22.626
controls the whole block.

30:24.251 --> 30:26.001
You mean take it? How?

30:27.210 --> 30:31.085
It wouldn't be easy, but the warders
are starting to ease up a wee bit,

30:31.251 --> 30:33.085
if we can build on that...

30:33.251 --> 30:34.835
make them feel secure...

30:35.418 --> 30:37.043
Then maybe that's the flaw.

30:37.751 --> 30:39.876
And then what? Have a block party?
Invitation only.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.376
Well, who knows what then?

30:41.543 --> 30:44.460
But it's a start, isn't it, or we
can just sit here with our heads up

30:44.543 --> 30:45.918
- our arses and do nothing.
- No.

30:46.001 --> 30:48.668
It's good. Genius Bobby.

30:49.376 --> 30:51.001
You're forgetting one tiny detail.

30:51.876 --> 30:56.793
If we try and take the warders on the wings,
the Loyalists will join them against us...

30:58.210 --> 30:59.626
And then the party's over.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.335
He's right.

31:03.001 --> 31:04.085
Damn it!

31:26.918 --> 31:28.960
Janet, love, is your mother there?

31:29.751 --> 31:31.626
<i>Yeah, she's here.</i>

31:31.960 --> 31:33.126
Can you put her on?

31:33.460 --> 31:36.210
<i>She, she doesn't want to, Dad.</i>

31:37.960 --> 31:39.251
Okay...

31:40.668 --> 31:42.126
Don't worry. I'll catch her again.

31:43.626 --> 31:45.835
How's London, your Auntie
showing you the sights?

31:46.251 --> 31:48.085
<i>We've been looking at schools.</i>

31:51.835 --> 31:53.335
You're going to school over there?

31:54.418 --> 31:55.960
Wow, that'll be an adventure.

31:56.085 --> 31:57.960
<i>I don't know anyone here.</i>

32:00.835 --> 32:02.960
You'll make friends in no time, you'll see.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.168
<i>I miss you, Dad.</i>

32:07.168 --> 32:08.335
I miss you too.

32:25.085 --> 32:27.835
Your murdering scum friends
were busy last night.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.168
Make you proud, does it?

32:38.668 --> 32:41.210
Those people weren't the target,
the police station...

32:41.418 --> 32:42.876
Oh, that squares it then, does it?

32:43.001 --> 32:44.710
It's their own fault for walking past.

32:44.793 --> 32:45.835
I didn't say that.

32:46.543 --> 32:48.876
No one wants to see
civilians killed, it was an accident.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.710
No. You plant a bomb on a street
then nothing's an accident!

32:52.876 --> 32:55.251
You know, I've met all sorts in my time.

32:55.626 --> 32:58.460
Pick-pockets, muggers, rapists...

32:59.043 --> 33:01.126
And there's a difference
between them and you lot.

33:01.376 --> 33:02.501
Do you know what it is?

33:03.835 --> 33:05.501
Most of them regret what they did.

33:10.376 --> 33:12.710
You keep that. Stick it on your wall.

34:25.001 --> 34:26.585
Larry Marley?

34:26.710 --> 34:28.793
- Yes?
- You wrote to me.

34:28.876 --> 34:30.793
Your wife rang and told me
I should come today.

34:31.710 --> 34:34.251
Oh, yeah... Right.

34:35.585 --> 34:37.085
You were expecting somebody else?

34:37.751 --> 34:41.876
No. I thought you might
be my son, that's all.

34:46.210 --> 34:51.251
I was your husband's cellmate
when he went on the strike.

34:53.460 --> 34:56.251
Then when he got weaker and they were
moving him up to the hospital,

34:56.335 --> 34:58.293
he asked if I'd give you a message.

34:59.210 --> 35:02.543
Yeah? What was that?

35:04.418 --> 35:06.460
"Keep up the struggle, love. Don't give in.

35:07.418 --> 35:09.335
"I'm starving myself to death for Ireland."

35:13.418 --> 35:14.918
He asked me to tell you that...

35:16.376 --> 35:18.418
Long before you two met,

35:19.751 --> 35:21.001
he saw you.

35:22.626 --> 35:25.793
You were working at a fair, behind a stall.

35:26.918 --> 35:30.501
He said you didn't notice him and he
was too chicken to go and talk to you.

35:30.751 --> 35:32.460
So he just watched you for a while...

35:33.626 --> 35:39.293
He said you were joking and smiling and that
he fell in love with you there and then...

35:40.876 --> 35:42.126
From that one look.

35:46.293 --> 35:47.376
That's it.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.293
That's all he wanted me to tell you.

35:54.835 --> 35:56.751
He can still make me cry even from the grave.

35:58.793 --> 36:00.210
He always was a romantic eejit.

36:02.585 --> 36:03.876
I'm sorry.

36:05.251 --> 36:06.668
He was a good friend of mine.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.793
If you were really his friend
you should have stopped him.

36:15.168 --> 36:16.501
He won't be forgotten.

36:19.126 --> 36:20.460
I'm gonna do something for him.

36:22.710 --> 36:23.835
For all ten of them.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.626
You can't bring him back though, can you?

36:30.043 --> 36:31.335
You can never do that.

37:18.085 --> 37:19.793
Stand aside, Taigs.

37:19.876 --> 37:23.960
It's the 12th of July and today we march
where we please in our own country.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.126
Not here you don't, kid.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.418
From here on it's a Republican area.

37:30.293 --> 37:32.751
That makes it a bastard free zone.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.835
Did we move to Dublin
when I was kipping, fellas?

37:36.793 --> 37:38.918
No, I didn't think so.

37:40.376 --> 37:42.918
All roads here are British, every last one.

37:43.626 --> 37:46.043
I think you already know that, don't you?

37:46.835 --> 37:47.918
We need to use this.

37:52.668 --> 37:54.001
What's the matter, Kenny?

37:56.043 --> 37:57.626
Police aren't here to hold your hand?

37:58.293 --> 38:01.376
Let's discuss it, negotiate a fair solution?

38:01.751 --> 38:03.793
Nah. There's nothing more
to talk about, is there?

38:05.085 --> 38:06.335
The future's already settled.

38:30.126 --> 38:33.835
Help us! We can't let scum like this
get away with it. Not today.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.835
You've got to be fucking kidding me!

38:36.085 --> 38:38.168
Fucking traitors!

38:51.668 --> 38:54.043
Fuck off, bastards!

39:11.626 --> 39:12.835
Game over, lads.

39:14.293 --> 39:15.918
You have until tomorrow to get out.

39:17.293 --> 39:20.168
Or one of you won't be
seeing your next birthday.

39:48.460 --> 39:51.668
Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio...

39:53.043 --> 39:55.501
Who runs this place, you or them?

39:59.835 --> 40:04.001
Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio...

40:05.251 --> 40:07.001
First we let them have civilian clothes,

40:07.085 --> 40:10.168
and now we're handing them
their own private wings on a plate.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.668
Have we done some deal
that I don't know about?

40:12.793 --> 40:15.793
We've just relaxed a few policies,
for a calmer atmosphere, that's all.

40:16.210 --> 40:19.168
Eighteen prison officers were murdered
enforcing those policies.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.918
I was almost one of them.

40:21.376 --> 40:23.210
I'm sorry about what happened to you, Gordon

40:23.876 --> 40:26.418
but we all want an easier life,
the prisoners too.

40:27.501 --> 40:28.835
When the hunger strikes were on,

40:28.918 --> 40:31.335
coming in here was like walking
through the gates of hell.

40:31.418 --> 40:34.960
Now when I go home, I can have
an actual conversation with my wife.

40:37.626 --> 40:40.376
Take some time off, Gordon? Eh?

40:52.585 --> 40:55.293
Bunch of animals.
We should be feeding yiz peanuts.

41:08.585 --> 41:10.376
Jesus, you look like shit.

41:17.585 --> 41:20.293
Thanks to Ken and his marching band,
everything's changed.

41:20.376 --> 41:22.918
- We can do this now.
- Not so fast.

41:25.001 --> 41:28.918
I'm stalling everything until our friends
on the outside get up to speed on this.

41:29.001 --> 41:30.251
What! Hold on a minute.

41:30.793 --> 41:31.835
It's way too early.

41:31.918 --> 41:33.501
This is only one piece of a big jigsaw.

41:33.668 --> 41:34.918
Sorry, can't do it, Larry.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.543
We've gotten this far by ourselves
but we're not alone.

41:38.668 --> 41:41.710
So you're to down tools
and wait until they have their say.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.960
That's an order. You write it up.

42:19.876 --> 42:21.043
Just leave it there.

42:27.001 --> 42:28.251
O'Shea.

42:29.793 --> 42:30.960
Kelly.

42:57.501 --> 42:58.876
Stay together!

43:08.001 --> 43:09.835
Go on, fuck off!

43:20.001 --> 43:21.085
Get back!

43:43.835 --> 43:45.251
Message from your Da.

43:45.335 --> 43:47.918
He's expecting you. Now fuck off home.

44:09.335 --> 44:11.293
I made it first instead of asking.
You want it?

44:13.085 --> 44:14.251
Go on.

44:37.168 --> 44:39.793
Are you proud of yourself
for that stunt the other day?

44:41.876 --> 44:43.418
Some things are worth fighting for.

44:43.626 --> 44:46.501
Cop yourself on, Larry.
You like prison, do you?

44:47.585 --> 44:48.835
Not a hell of a lot...

44:49.501 --> 44:51.126
But you get used to it after ten years.

44:55.335 --> 44:58.335
Your family? The girl looks smart.

44:58.793 --> 45:00.960
She is, bright as a button.

45:01.126 --> 45:03.918
Your wife's a bit of a looker too,
Gordon! How did you manage that?

45:05.168 --> 45:06.543
We're not together right now.

45:08.001 --> 45:09.251
She moved over to London.

45:10.668 --> 45:12.043
I'm sorry to hear that.

45:14.668 --> 45:16.585
You might not understand this, but...

45:17.210 --> 45:19.835
I spent half my life trying to
protect them from you bastards.

45:20.335 --> 45:22.001
And after all that she ups and leaves.

45:23.043 --> 45:25.626
Well I'd be home with my family
if it wasn't for you bastards.

45:25.876 --> 45:28.543
It's your own fault that you're
in here, Larry. No one else's.

45:28.626 --> 45:31.126
I don't see it that way.
I know you probably wouldn't agree.

45:31.210 --> 45:32.751
No. You're right, I don't.

45:36.585 --> 45:39.418
Now piss off back to work,
this isn't a daycare centre.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.418
You wait there a minute.

46:07.126 --> 46:08.418
They knocked it back.

46:13.210 --> 46:14.876
I told you it wasn't ready, didn't I,

46:16.085 --> 46:18.126
but no, you had to go
and send the damn thing out.

46:18.210 --> 46:20.126
You don't get to make these decisions, Larry.

46:20.210 --> 46:21.251
They didn't buy into it

46:21.335 --> 46:24.126
and they don't want a botched escape
hurting morale on the outside.

46:24.460 --> 46:26.001
Fuck their morale!

46:27.626 --> 46:29.543
What about ours? We're on the floor in here.

46:29.626 --> 46:30.918
Look, we don't have to stop,

46:31.001 --> 46:33.001
but trying to take
a whole block, it's too risky.

46:34.085 --> 46:36.126
We need to set our sights lower.

46:36.751 --> 46:38.710
I've a couple of guys
I want you to meet later.

46:38.793 --> 46:40.626
That's your new strategy? Think small?

46:41.418 --> 46:43.751
It has to be big.
That's the whole bloody point.

46:43.835 --> 46:46.251
It's finished, okay. Move on.

46:47.085 --> 46:48.543
No! I need to do this. I have to.

46:48.626 --> 46:49.876
You need to do this?

46:50.710 --> 46:51.876
We're in this together.

46:53.710 --> 46:54.835
Don't forget that.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.293
All right, come on.

47:09.751 --> 47:10.918
Let me back in!

47:38.668 --> 47:40.335
I want you to meet those two guys later.

47:41.293 --> 47:42.751
Their plan is less complicated.

47:43.626 --> 47:45.043
You talk to them. I'm done.

47:47.085 --> 47:48.460
I'm not asking, Larry.

48:05.960 --> 48:09.543
We want to go this way from the garden,
using ropes and ladders to get this far.

48:10.085 --> 48:11.960
The warder can't see us from the tower.

48:12.085 --> 48:13.501
He comes around every ten minutes.

48:23.126 --> 48:24.251
Where are they off to?

48:25.501 --> 48:26.668
The garden.

48:27.335 --> 48:30.126
Say they want to grow stuff.
Governor gave the O.K.

48:55.876 --> 48:57.376
See ya lads, I won't be here

48:57.460 --> 48:59.376
when you get back. I won my appeal.

48:59.918 --> 49:01.251
You jammy sod.

49:21.376 --> 49:22.918
- Same old car?
- Aye.

49:27.168 --> 49:28.251
Hey, I know them...

49:29.751 --> 49:31.085
That's the food lorry.

49:33.376 --> 49:34.876
Cheers for doing this.

49:35.710 --> 49:36.918
No problem.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.460
Sorry to hear about your trouble.

50:12.043 --> 50:14.001
He drives it around
the prison all day long...

50:15.460 --> 50:16.751
Meals on wheels.

50:21.585 --> 50:22.751
Do they search it?

50:34.501 --> 50:36.501
O'Brien followed your friend last night...

50:46.293 --> 50:48.626
Looks like your plan is back on the table.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.085
Need a hand there?

51:08.001 --> 51:09.043
I could do with one.

51:13.460 --> 51:14.710
Just there.

51:16.043 --> 51:17.585
Right, just lift it.

51:50.710 --> 51:51.751
How many?

52:00.293 --> 52:01.835
Packed in like sardines.

52:02.751 --> 52:04.585
- Thirty-eight.
- Jesus...

52:05.168 --> 52:08.043
- That big enough for you?
- No, actually, but it'll do.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.668
Brendan and Bobby,
we're gonna take your block, H7.

52:13.293 --> 52:16.335
Then we're all gonna get in
the food lorry and drive out the gate.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.251
I've to go out for a minute.

52:35.585 --> 52:37.543
Guard the fort, with your life.

52:39.085 --> 52:40.335
You're trusting me with it?

52:41.293 --> 52:42.543
What are you going to swipe?

53:39.293 --> 53:42.168
It needs to be injury free, no blood spilled,

53:42.835 --> 53:45.126
otherwise they'll write about that
and not what we did.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.335
And to do that some of us
are gonna need to be carrying.

53:48.710 --> 53:51.335
Fuck... How many will we need?

53:52.418 --> 53:53.793
Six'll do it.

53:54.335 --> 53:57.043
Look, if we have them, there's less
chance of anyone getting hurt.

53:57.876 --> 53:59.376
Can they find a way to get them in?

54:01.835 --> 54:04.126
Seen your wife lately, Fenian lover?

54:04.501 --> 54:05.876
What did you say?

54:07.085 --> 54:09.876
You heard. Forgotten which side
you're on, Gordon?

54:10.751 --> 54:12.668
Well, I'm not on your side, arsehole.

54:17.335 --> 54:18.751
Fuck you, Gordon!

54:30.210 --> 54:32.835
Is there something I should know about? Huh?

54:34.585 --> 54:38.001
Fuck's sake! I don't want to see anything
like that again. Do you fucking hear me?

54:56.460 --> 54:57.751
What have you got there?

54:59.210 --> 55:01.085
Nothing. It's personal.

55:02.376 --> 55:04.543
Show me... Now.

55:21.668 --> 55:22.918
It looks just like her.

55:28.418 --> 55:31.960
You know, there's one thing
I don't get about you.

55:33.001 --> 55:34.210
What's that?

55:35.543 --> 55:38.043
How the hell do you keep your marriage
together from in here?

55:39.043 --> 55:40.918
Maybe because we don't have to live together.

55:42.251 --> 55:45.043
We've known each other since
we were kids. Kinda joined at the hip.

55:45.626 --> 55:47.668
Well, a man should look
after a woman like that.

55:49.710 --> 55:52.626
Don't you worry. Once I get out that gate...

55:53.626 --> 55:54.710
I'm not coming back.

56:26.126 --> 56:29.918
They'd never expect men on all four wings
to work together at the same time.

56:30.918 --> 56:33.918
Imagine a ripple in water
moving out from the centre

56:34.001 --> 56:35.335
each warder taken,

56:35.418 --> 56:37.876
one after the other, like dominoes falling.

56:43.335 --> 56:45.918
One shot. That's all we've got.

57:18.126 --> 57:19.293
O'Toole.

57:20.876 --> 57:22.001
Delahunty.

57:22.918 --> 57:24.001
Healey.

57:25.668 --> 57:26.835
Flanagan.

57:27.918 --> 57:29.001
Ryan.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.085
Marley.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.043
How's it going, son?

57:41.668 --> 57:42.751
- All right.
- All right.

57:54.043 --> 57:55.210
The choices you made...

57:57.001 --> 57:58.460
What if you had them to do over?

58:00.668 --> 58:03.501
I'd do the same.
I've no regrets about what I did.

58:03.585 --> 58:05.918
So, why was it right for you and not for me?

58:07.835 --> 58:09.751
Someday men like us

58:10.960 --> 58:12.460
will be a thing of the past.

58:14.626 --> 58:16.085
The future's yours, Danny,

58:17.501 --> 58:18.751
if you don't mess it up.

58:21.168 --> 58:22.835
What about your studies, how's all that?

58:23.210 --> 58:26.085
You could follow your big brother
and go on to college, couldn't you?

58:28.876 --> 58:30.418
You don't think college is a cop out?

58:31.168 --> 58:32.376
It's not about that.

58:35.168 --> 58:36.918
Danny, we're talking about your life.

58:37.543 --> 58:40.501
Look, when I'm out, things
are gonna be different. You'll see.

58:44.126 --> 58:45.835
And you'll be there to see me graduate?

58:47.793 --> 58:49.876
I'll make a deal with you, all right.

58:51.085 --> 58:52.376
You do it...

58:54.168 --> 58:57.543
And I'll be sitting in the front row,
with a big grin on my face.

58:59.168 --> 59:00.418
That's a promise.

59:04.793 --> 59:06.543
I've been meaning to ask you something...

59:10.793 --> 59:14.543
If the hunger strike hadn't ended,
would you have gone on it?

59:18.168 --> 59:20.793
I dunno. I guess, probably.

59:22.126 --> 59:24.376
So you would have been willing
to leave us all behind?

59:27.126 --> 59:28.835
But it did end, Danny.

59:34.585 --> 59:35.793
Aye...

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:23.293
We need to talk about my transfer...

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.168
That's it.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.960
We're looking at a week today
if you give us the nod.

01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:34.710
Sorry lads, we can't.

01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:37.960
You're joking. Why?

01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:41.335
Ropes and ladders was never
going to work here.

01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:43.085
They've second guessed all of that.

01:00:43.418 --> 01:00:45.876
They'd spot you as soon as
you stuck your head over a wall.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.418
If you thought that all along,

01:00:48.418 --> 01:00:49.960
why didn't you say so before?

01:00:51.085 --> 01:00:52.460
They've something else on.

01:00:52.543 --> 01:00:54.626
- Yiz do, don't you?
- We're done here.

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:57.210
- Come on, you can't do that!
- Mick.

01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.251
We're all on the same team, lads.

01:00:59.335 --> 01:01:00.751
And no means no, by the way.

01:01:02.543 --> 01:01:04.168
So no solo runs, okay?

01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:08.793
There's a shift change at four o'clock.

01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:10.293
Too many warders coming on then.

01:02:10.376 --> 01:02:14.001
Which means the food lorry has
to leave the block by 3:40 at the latest.

01:02:15.043 --> 01:02:18.835
So what, they just open up the main gate
for you and blow you a kiss goodbye?

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.918
No. There'll be a system.

01:02:21.168 --> 01:02:22.668
Something special.

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:26.085
And we're not going anywhere
until we find out what it is.

01:02:28.668 --> 01:02:31.460
- Any news on your transfer?
- That's all in hand.

01:02:47.043 --> 01:02:48.626
Enjoy the weekend, Gordon.

01:02:49.168 --> 01:02:50.751
Oh, I intend to.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.751
Must be a mad scramble
to get out of here on a Friday.

01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:00.918
A stampede, more like.

01:03:01.418 --> 01:03:03.126
You'd swear the pubs closed at eight.

01:03:04.085 --> 01:03:06.168
I suppose the main gate
would be the worst, right?

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.543
No...

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:11.876
Well having to sign out at admin
every time is a pain.

01:03:12.168 --> 01:03:15.876
They open the gate,
but then it doesn't take long.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:19.293
They give you a pass on the way in and
you just hand it back on the way out.

01:03:19.376 --> 01:03:22.251
Oh, something high-tech I bet?

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:25.460
You'd laugh if I told you.

01:03:32.168 --> 01:03:35.668
Secret passes, makes it sound
like a kid's tree house, doesn't it?

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.168
Anyway, have a good one.

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.043
Aye. See you, Larry.

01:04:02.835 --> 01:04:04.418
What are you at?

01:04:09.793 --> 01:04:11.001
Fuck's sake, Larry!

01:04:13.293 --> 01:04:15.043
What the fuck you playing at, man?

01:04:20.626 --> 01:04:21.918
Hello!

01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:25.085
What are you doing, Larry?

01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:28.626
We have to take the admin lodge,

01:04:28.793 --> 01:04:30.835
and someone's gonna have
to stay behind in there.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.251
That's the main gate pass...

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.126
Here's Larry now.

01:05:16.585 --> 01:05:18.126
Prisoner for transfer.

01:06:10.168 --> 01:06:11.418
I need the bumper.

01:06:17.001 --> 01:06:18.210
Bumper.

01:06:54.376 --> 01:06:56.293
Andy, come here a minute.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.626
Working.

01:07:30.168 --> 01:07:31.251
Thanks.

01:07:41.001 --> 01:07:42.293
You look like you saw a ghost.

01:07:43.918 --> 01:07:45.043
Why are you here?

01:07:45.126 --> 01:07:46.751
I thought you were off for the weekend?

01:07:47.543 --> 01:07:49.876
Aye, I was. George had an emergency.

01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:52.876
- Lucky me was on standby.
- Right...

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:21.042
- Stick the kettle on, will ya?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:30.542
- All right.
- All right.

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:43.792
Don't move.

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:46.542
Come with me!

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:50.001
Don't move, don't touch anything.
Get on the floor now.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.501
Just do what you're told and you'll be okay.

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:54.835
Open the gate.

01:08:56.335 --> 01:08:57.626
Quickly.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.376
There we go. Same again.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.501
- There you go.
- Good man.

01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:26.626
Nobody move!

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.417
Don't make a sound.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.835
- You're under arrest.
- Very funny.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.126
It's no joke, mate.
Get your fucking hands up now!

01:09:40.335 --> 01:09:42.335
Open the gate! Quickly!

01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:50.542
Settle. Easy.

01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:52.626
Back off.

01:09:53.251 --> 01:09:54.543
In!

01:09:54.626 --> 01:09:56.626
All of you, on the floor. Now!

01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:09.085
Don't move!

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.626
John, open the door or I'll shoot.

01:10:24.626 --> 01:10:26.126
What did you do that for?

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:27.376
I don't know...

01:10:28.585 --> 01:10:30.376
- I don't know...
- Doctor!

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.418
Doctor!

01:10:32.501 --> 01:10:34.043
Doctor, you're needed. Come on.

01:10:35.918 --> 01:10:37.460
The rest of you, uniforms off.

01:10:38.418 --> 01:10:39.835
You heard me. Off!

01:10:41.293 --> 01:10:43.085
John... can you hear me, John?

01:10:44.918 --> 01:10:47.418
You're gonna be okay, John.
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.876
John!

01:11:00.085 --> 01:11:03.001
No lunch today, Gordon?
The grub shoulda been here already.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.960
Speak of the devil, and it shall appear.

01:11:24.668 --> 01:11:27.001
I thought you'd forgotten us.
Here, I'll give you a hand.

01:11:27.085 --> 01:11:29.085
Don't panic. You'll all be fed.

01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:41.085
Jesus, Larry. Did you have to?

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:43.585
It's okay, I'll fix it.
We'll get the rest first, okay.

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.460
Yeah?

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.251
The food lorry?

01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:06.793
No, it was late getting here.

01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:11.043
He's just gone.
You should be seeing him any second.

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:17.085
H8. Everybody's hungry today.

01:12:50.501 --> 01:12:52.543
Don't even breathe.

01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:21.710
Holy shit...

01:13:22.918 --> 01:13:24.043
Close it!

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:42.001
There's a bomb under your seat.
I have the button.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:43.751
Now, go.

01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:09.210
Listen, it's none of my business but...

01:14:10.043 --> 01:14:14.418
Maybe one weekend you might try going over
to London, talk things over with your wife.

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.835
You ever thought about that?

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:21.418
Sure...

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:24.376
But she doesn't want to talk to me.

01:14:25.876 --> 01:14:27.210
Like a brick wall.

01:14:29.793 --> 01:14:32.210
When things need saying,
you gotta be looking eye to eye.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.960
Believe me, I'm an expert
on long distance disasters.

01:14:37.543 --> 01:14:38.918
And you'd see your daughter too.

01:14:39.376 --> 01:14:40.876
When was the last time you saw her?

01:14:44.626 --> 01:14:46.543
Turning into a marriage
counsellor now, Larry?

01:14:47.001 --> 01:14:48.168
Me? No.

01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:52.501
But they're the most important thing,
aren't they, our kids?

01:14:54.168 --> 01:14:56.126
Doesn't matter about us, we're just...

01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:58.668
Caretakers for their future.

01:14:59.335 --> 01:15:01.126
We're not doing much of a job then, are we?

01:15:02.251 --> 01:15:03.335
No, we're not.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.293
False alarm. Baby's not due
for another three weeks.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.251
Thanks a lot for covering,
but I want to save the days.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:26.126
Yes! Well done baby,
getting my weekend after all.

01:15:27.168 --> 01:15:28.251
You're leaving?

01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:31.210
I was intending to, yes.
Have you got a problem with that?

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.543
No, no. So, you have any plans?

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.251
Football, T.V., beer.

01:15:36.876 --> 01:15:38.085
Oh, yeah, who's playing?

01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:40.335
The usual, Larry.

01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:43.793
Look, if you don't mind
I'd really like to get out of here.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:45.168
Yeah, sure, no bother.

01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:50.418
Safe home.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.751
How much you get paid for this?

01:16:32.501 --> 01:16:33.960
Not fucking enough.

01:16:52.043 --> 01:16:55.085
Hand that to the gate guard
and don't try anything.

01:17:00.085 --> 01:17:01.293
Pull up here.

01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:27.168
Read that paper.

01:17:55.876 --> 01:17:57.043
Don't move a muscle.

01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:18.418
In!

01:18:19.793 --> 01:18:20.918
Open the gate.

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:22.751
Now!

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.668
They made me O.C. on this wing, Larry.

01:18:36.876 --> 01:18:38.710
So, is there something you want to tell me?

01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:58.460
C'mon lads!

01:19:03.751 --> 01:19:04.918
Shift change...

01:19:05.376 --> 01:19:06.585
Bloody shift change...

01:19:30.585 --> 01:19:32.918
Hey, you, you bastard,
what the fuck are you doing here?

01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:42.668
Help! We need some help here.

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.710
The warders are fighting.

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.668
They're thumping the lard out of each other.

01:19:58.751 --> 01:19:59.835
What do I do?

01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:02.001
Gerry, get them out!

01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:06.001
Game over, lads. Run for it!

01:20:15.876 --> 01:20:17.376
They are prisoners!

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.710
We have to break it!

01:20:31.376 --> 01:20:32.793
You told them you weren't going!

01:20:33.585 --> 01:20:34.960
You're shitting me?

01:20:35.835 --> 01:20:37.210
I had a promise to keep.

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:39.960
Two more years
and I can go home to my family.

01:20:41.418 --> 01:20:42.710
They didn't need me, anyway.

01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.626
The plan was tight, best I've ever seen.

01:20:52.001 --> 01:20:53.751
They could've just found out they're gone.

01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:01.335
Gordon, let him go!

01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:02.710
Fuck you!

01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:14.793
Pull! Pull!

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:39.710
Yiz are in trouble now, boys.

01:22:03.626 --> 01:22:05.751
Do a head count and untie them.

01:22:22.418 --> 01:22:25.585
Come on! Come on! Get moving!

01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:09.668
Hey, we have ya!

01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:16.085
Don't even think about running!

01:23:16.501 --> 01:23:17.960
Keep your fucking hands up!

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.418
Thirty-eight missing, sir.

01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:30.043
- Sir?
- What is it?

01:23:30.293 --> 01:23:32.376
I think Larry Marley
had something to do with this.

01:23:32.585 --> 01:23:33.710
Marley?

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:36.085
Isn't he in H2, what are you talking about?

01:23:36.585 --> 01:23:39.210
The organisers of this escape
are out there somewhere on the run.

01:23:39.293 --> 01:23:40.543
I don't have time for this.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.335
We got out, Larry!

01:24:02.835 --> 01:24:04.251
We showed them all!

01:24:09.710 --> 01:24:11.043
Search!

01:24:32.335 --> 01:24:33.543
What are you doing here?

01:24:34.585 --> 01:24:35.835
Why aren't you with them?

01:24:39.376 --> 01:24:40.751
I'd have given anything to be...

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:43.460
Almost...

01:24:46.126 --> 01:24:47.793
I was on the run once, did you know that?

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:50.585
Managed to break out of a courthouse cell.

01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:52.210
Saw my family three times that year.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.585
It's like you said, they deserve better.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.918
You're one clever bastard.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
I suppose you think
you've won something today.

01:25:03.085 --> 01:25:05.001
Scored a few points for your side.

01:25:06.543 --> 01:25:07.876
Well nothing's changed you know.

01:25:08.043 --> 01:25:11.793
You, me, all those guys out there
legging it across the fields,

01:25:12.126 --> 01:25:14.668
we're all still stuck
in the same place, going nowhere.

01:25:19.585 --> 01:25:23.168
He was a good man,
the warder your friends killed.

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:26.335
Oh. You didn't know?

01:25:27.543 --> 01:25:29.876
See, that's what happens
when you unleash the monster...

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:31.710
People get hurt.

01:25:33.293 --> 01:25:34.376
Why me?

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.876
Out of all the warders
you picked me, didn't you?

01:25:41.376 --> 01:25:44.001
Ten of my friends died
in this prison on hunger strike.

01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:48.751
They thought they'd broken us
but now the world knows they haven't.

01:25:50.543 --> 01:25:52.501
A debt's been repaid to those men.

01:25:55.043 --> 01:25:57.001
I don't expect you
to understand that, Gordon.

01:26:00.085 --> 01:26:01.168
Prisoner Marley,

01:26:01.585 --> 01:26:05.001
in future you will address me
only as Warder or Sir.

01:26:06.293 --> 01:26:07.626
Is that clear?

01:26:46.085 --> 01:26:49.460
You know, I used to think
my job was important,

01:26:50.585 --> 01:26:53.751
that I was doing
some vital role for society...

01:26:56.126 --> 01:26:59.668
I warned them that they were making
too many concessions but nobody cared.

01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:03.043
The warders didn't make
the policies in this prison,

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:06.376
we just did our duty
to the best of our abilities.

01:27:07.168 --> 01:27:08.251
Most of us.

01:27:09.085 --> 01:27:11.043
But you were deceived by the prisoners?

01:27:13.085 --> 01:27:14.460
You let your guard down.

01:27:15.918 --> 01:27:17.376
You can twist it any way you like.

01:27:17.918 --> 01:27:20.168
It was supposed to be
the most secure prison in Europe.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.043
It wasn't supposed to have a flaw.

01:27:22.543 --> 01:27:24.335
Which flaw are you referring to?

01:27:24.876 --> 01:27:27.126
The circle, all the power in one place.

01:27:28.126 --> 01:27:30.376
But it was prison staff
who let them into the circle.

01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:33.710
Lifers, men with murder convictions.

01:27:34.418 --> 01:27:35.501
They seemed worn out.

01:27:37.626 --> 01:27:38.793
But it was a trick.

01:27:40.085 --> 01:27:42.210
You all allowed yourselves to be tricked.

01:27:44.668 --> 01:27:47.168
We did. I did.

01:27:49.293 --> 01:27:50.751
You can have my resignation too.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.085
That won't be necessary.

01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:55.293
I don't need your permission.

01:27:57.918 --> 01:27:59.376
I'm granting myself parole.
