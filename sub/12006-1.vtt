00:01.675 --> 00:03.566
Your protest has forced the school board

00:03.667 --> 00:07.402
- to reconsider closing Carlton,
- ____

00:07.503 --> 00:09.104
but there will be some changes.

00:09.205 --> 00:10.772
50% hearing?

00:10.873 --> 00:13.408
We all remember what it
was like to be so sure

00:13.509 --> 00:16.111
that the way we felt would never change.

00:16.212 --> 00:18.614
We're gonna be helping
communities in Peru for six months.

00:19.916 --> 00:20.782
Are you Barbara Salz?

00:20.883 --> 00:22.450
Della Porta is your restaurant, right?

00:22.551 --> 00:25.853
- You and I could be competitors.
- Unless we team up.

00:25.954 --> 00:28.623
- It's your money. It's your business.
- It's our money.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.424
- Those aren't mine.
- How could you sleep with someone else?

00:30.525 --> 00:32.093
Bay and I were a summer thing.

00:32.192 --> 00:34.996
Sex is a big deal, and you don't
just have it with someone else

00:35.097 --> 00:37.197
because you're being sent overseas.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.365
- You didn't do it.
- You can't tell her.

00:39.506 --> 00:40.974
Politics can be a dirty business.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.143
I mean, People end up doing
things that can ruin lives.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.980
So you actually thought you could
get away with blackmailing a senator?

00:47.081 --> 00:48.915
- How bad is it?
- Sent it.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.917
She used a phone to transmit a threat.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.153
That is a felony. That
could mean jail time.

00:53.253 --> 00:56.755
I never saw this coming. Not from you.

01:13.272 --> 01:16.774
You deserve to be here.

01:18.644 --> 01:20.345
Time to wake up.

01:21.514 --> 01:23.881
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:23.982 --> 01:26.384
First day of senior year.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.552
First day of community service, too.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.521
You nervous?

01:30.622 --> 01:32.456
Actually, I'm glad it's here.

01:32.557 --> 01:35.226
You ready for a fresh start, huh?

01:38.430 --> 01:39.896
Hey, aren't you excited?

01:39.997 --> 01:42.466
There's gonna be all
these new kids at Carlton.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.267
Maybe you'll make some new friends.

01:44.368 --> 01:47.203
Yeah, 'cause deaf kids are always
so welcoming to new hearing kids.

01:47.304 --> 01:49.305
- Morning. You hungry?
- A little.

01:49.406 --> 01:50.773
- I'll take a muffin.
- Here.

01:50.874 --> 01:53.109
John, hurry! Time for the photo!

01:53.210 --> 01:54.844
I'm here. I'm here.

01:54.945 --> 01:56.479
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.948
I was thinking about going for
a run later, if you want to join.

02:00.049 --> 02:02.618
Would that before or after your probation?

02:02.719 --> 02:06.455
All right, get together,
you guys. Here's the sign.

02:06.556 --> 02:08.690
- Take two.
- First one of these I'm not in.

02:08.791 --> 02:10.191
And the last one for all of us.

02:10.293 --> 02:12.927
Here we go. Ready?

02:13.028 --> 02:14.663
There we go.

02:14.764 --> 02:17.265
Hey, guys, out of O.J.

02:17.366 --> 02:20.434
Why don't you stock your
own fridge, Mr. Married Man?

02:20.535 --> 02:22.236
Okay, that's my cue to disappear.

02:22.337 --> 02:24.872
I got a phone date with
Nikki in a few minutes anyway.

02:24.973 --> 02:27.174
Bay, have you talked to Ty? How's he doing?

02:27.276 --> 02:31.645
Oh, he's great. Yeah, he's off
at some secret location training,

02:31.746 --> 02:33.613
but he's doing good. Very focused.

02:33.714 --> 02:35.181
We gotta go.

02:35.283 --> 02:36.650
Oh, me too.

02:36.751 --> 02:37.717
Thanks for the muffin.

02:37.818 --> 02:40.019
- Later, gators.
- Bye.

02:41.756 --> 02:45.258
I can't believe they're
gonna be gone so soon.

02:45.359 --> 02:48.260
Honey, come on, they're growing up.

02:48.361 --> 02:51.397
Yeah, well, as soon as the
girls go off to college,

02:51.498 --> 02:53.465
Regina's gonna move in with angelo.

02:53.566 --> 02:55.286
And Adrianna's gonna go back to Puerto Rico

02:55.335 --> 02:57.503
and the whole family is just gonna be poof.

02:57.604 --> 02:59.938
Come on, the world's gonna be our oyster.

03:00.039 --> 03:02.007
It's not like you're
never gonna see 'em again.

03:02.108 --> 03:04.175
Sweetie, you're being silly.

03:06.345 --> 03:07.878
See you tonight.

03:15.899 --> 03:17.712
____

03:17.829 --> 03:21.124
Look, I shouldn't have come
over the other night. I'm sorry.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.572
____

03:23.861 --> 03:26.863
I can't keep coming to you
crying about other guys.

03:26.964 --> 03:28.231
It's not cool.

03:28.232 --> 03:30.362
____

03:31.198 --> 03:33.479
Did you tell Daphne about what
happened between me and Ty?

03:33.504 --> 03:36.339
Because I really wanna
keep the whole thing...

03:36.340 --> 03:38.373
____

03:38.875 --> 03:41.143
Daphne and Regina are friends of his,

03:41.244 --> 03:44.880
and I don't think he'd appreciate me, like,

03:44.981 --> 03:47.383
telling the whole world about his sex life.

03:47.384 --> 03:48.580
____

03:48.585 --> 03:50.118
- Okay, you know what?
- ____

03:50.220 --> 03:52.454
Next year I'm gonna be
in art school in New York

03:52.555 --> 03:55.657
and this whole place will
be a million miles away.

03:59.795 --> 04:02.586
____

04:03.365 --> 04:05.724
____

04:06.120 --> 04:07.560
____

04:07.561 --> 04:09.826
____

04:24.785 --> 04:26.185
Because clearly,

04:26.286 --> 04:29.389
they know something we don't.

04:29.490 --> 04:34.541
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:36.463 --> 04:39.298
Please, everybody, we've
got a lot to cover today.

04:39.399 --> 04:42.801
So take your seat. Everyone, please.

04:42.902 --> 04:44.803
I'd like to go over the syllabus.

04:48.274 --> 04:51.710
I'd like to discuss my expectations of you.

04:53.145 --> 04:57.014
Will you please just all stop
talking and let her start class?

04:57.115 --> 04:58.849
Excuse me, I'm having a conversation here.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.351
Yeah, sorry to interrupt your call.

05:01.453 --> 05:03.587
Are you in charge? I don't think so.

05:03.688 --> 05:05.956
Everyone just calm down, please. Miss...

05:06.057 --> 05:08.426
Sharee. You can call me that.

05:08.527 --> 05:10.127
Miss Sharee.

05:12.797 --> 05:14.431
Thank you.

05:14.532 --> 05:17.366
Now I'd like to start this
morning by reading aloud

05:17.468 --> 05:18.735
from our first book "Great Expectations."

05:18.836 --> 05:20.403
Just don't make me listen to her read.

05:20.504 --> 05:23.205
Why not, Sharee? She probably
reads better than you.

05:23.307 --> 05:24.307
Read this!

05:28.177 --> 05:30.546
Ladies, stop that!

05:30.647 --> 05:33.214
All right, stop it. Excuse me, excuse me.

05:33.316 --> 05:34.750
Stop that! Stop that!

05:34.851 --> 05:36.752
Stop it!

05:36.853 --> 05:40.456
Go to the office, both of you! Now!

05:45.539 --> 05:46.828
Sit down, everyone, sit down.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.196
Sit down. Go.

05:49.297 --> 05:51.365
It's the typical disrespect the arts gets,

05:51.467 --> 05:55.830
- as if a monkey could teach it.
- ____

05:55.833 --> 05:57.404
No, but he is the orchestra teacher.

05:57.506 --> 06:01.441
He's practically having us do
a connect-the-dots worksheet.

06:03.108 --> 06:06.243
____

06:06.246 --> 06:09.883
I don't have a boyfriend.
I don't belong to any clubs.

06:09.984 --> 06:12.218
The only thing I was looking forward to

06:12.319 --> 06:14.220
about coming back here was art.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.070
____

06:18.180 --> 06:19.337
____

06:25.599 --> 06:28.601
"Senior elective permission slip."

06:29.506 --> 06:34.699
____

06:35.840 --> 06:37.625
____

06:37.630 --> 06:40.012
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

06:40.113 --> 06:41.246
Thank you.

06:45.084 --> 06:46.485
I'm gonna be late to work.

06:46.585 --> 06:48.452
I can't believe you're
making me wait a whole year.

06:48.553 --> 06:51.622
Not for sex, just to live together.

06:51.723 --> 06:55.192
But I'm lonely.

06:55.293 --> 06:57.028
What... what... what is that?

06:57.129 --> 06:59.796
That's Leo and Victor.

06:59.898 --> 07:02.799
- You better zip up.
- Stay.

07:03.902 --> 07:05.468
I have a video chat with Abby.

07:05.569 --> 07:08.704
- I want you to get to know her.
- I can't.

07:08.805 --> 07:11.941
She's your daughter. And I have to go.

07:13.344 --> 07:14.911
Go.

07:21.188 --> 07:23.628
Thank you so much for seeing
me on such short notice.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.254
My husband doesn't believe in psychiatry

07:25.321 --> 07:28.090
so I didn't tell him I was coming in.

07:28.191 --> 07:29.591
So what's going on?

07:29.692 --> 07:32.627
Well, our 19-year-old son

07:32.728 --> 07:36.564
just got married against our wishes.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.168
Our daughters are leaving for
college in just a few months.

07:40.269 --> 07:43.171
And my husband is getting
hell from his colleagues

07:43.272 --> 07:45.005
for something he had nothing to do with.

07:45.107 --> 07:47.775
- What about you?
- Me?

07:50.612 --> 07:52.745
I'm used to change.

07:54.248 --> 07:56.316
But ever since I found
out about the switch,

07:56.417 --> 08:00.220
it's just been one thing after another.

08:00.321 --> 08:03.590
And I'm busy all the time

08:03.691 --> 08:06.659
with my husband's things and my kids,

08:06.760 --> 08:10.563
but I just don't feel
excited about anything.

08:10.663 --> 08:12.831
Sometimes I feel,

08:12.932 --> 08:16.068
I don't know how to explain it.

08:16.169 --> 08:19.338
Untethered?

08:19.439 --> 08:22.975
Like I'm watching myself float away.

08:26.011 --> 08:31.382
I'd like to start you on 50 mg a day.

08:31.484 --> 08:34.318
Call me in about six weeks.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.953
So that's it?

08:36.054 --> 08:38.222
Just take these and I'll feel better?

08:38.323 --> 08:40.957
You might. A lot of
these things are chemical.

08:41.058 --> 08:44.059
Okay. Good.

08:44.162 --> 08:46.696
That seems easy.

08:49.171 --> 08:52.466
____

08:52.467 --> 08:56.415
____

09:02.881 --> 09:04.530
____

09:08.652 --> 09:09.818
Hi.

09:11.054 --> 09:14.722
I just wanted to say "peace."

09:14.823 --> 09:17.959
I'm sure it's weird for you to be at
a school with a bunch of deaf kids,

09:18.060 --> 09:19.827
but we're just like everyone else.

09:19.928 --> 09:22.396
You just have to face us and enunciate.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.967
And a lot of us are happy

09:27.068 --> 09:28.969
you guys are here,
'cause for a while there,

09:29.070 --> 09:31.004
it looked like we were gonna be split up

09:31.105 --> 09:33.507
and sent to a bunch of different schools.

09:33.608 --> 09:37.510
Then me and a bunch of other kids

09:37.611 --> 09:40.647
organized this, like, protest,

09:40.747 --> 09:43.883
and so anyway the school board
decided to keep Carlton open

09:43.984 --> 09:47.987
and send in a bunch of hearing kids.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.157
- And so...
- And so what you're trying to say is

09:51.258 --> 09:52.559
me waking up at 6:00 A.M.,

09:52.660 --> 09:54.493
sitting on a bus for 45 minutes,

09:54.594 --> 09:55.794
splitting up from my friends

09:55.895 --> 09:58.297
because my school
closed, is because of you?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.968
Now I know who to thank for being
stuck in a school full of dumbasses.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.371
We're not dumb. We're deaf.

10:06.472 --> 10:08.674
I don't mean you.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.107
I mean us.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.975
I don't understand.

10:12.077 --> 10:14.111
This is the dumping ground for
all the screw-ups and losers

10:14.213 --> 10:15.546
that none of the other schools wanted.

10:15.647 --> 10:17.981
Congratulations on your protest.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.850
Good job there.

10:27.365 --> 10:31.593
Art is in the eye of the
beholder, true or false?

10:32.596 --> 10:35.498
- True.
- If it's true, what the hell are you doing here?

10:35.599 --> 10:38.534
Art is subjective.

10:38.635 --> 10:41.636
But there are certain things you can
learn so you won't sound like an ignoramus

10:41.737 --> 10:43.972
the rest of your life.

10:44.073 --> 10:45.707
Welcome to theories of modern art.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.680
- And you're late.
- I'm sorry. I lost my pledge pin.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.350
- I had to do 50 push-ups.
- Ah. Of course.

10:55.451 --> 10:58.786
- Hazing season.
- Omega psi!

10:58.887 --> 11:00.621
- And then bowling?
- No, ma'am.

11:00.722 --> 11:03.090
If you lose your pledge pin, they
make you carry around a brick.

11:03.191 --> 11:04.792
But if you're caught without that brick,

11:04.793 --> 11:06.794
you gotta carry the bowling ball.

11:06.895 --> 11:09.663
And if you lose that?

11:09.764 --> 11:12.233
A live chicken.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.134
I assume you're Miles Conroy.

11:14.235 --> 11:16.536
- Tank.
- Tank.

11:16.637 --> 11:18.271
I'm Professor Ledarsky.

11:18.372 --> 11:22.075
As long as you participate, you
can eat a live chicken in class.

11:22.176 --> 11:24.811
I don't care.

11:24.912 --> 11:26.413
All right!

11:26.513 --> 11:29.181
That's my kind of gal.

11:34.421 --> 11:35.520
What?

11:37.057 --> 11:40.725
Oh, perfect. Just great.

11:40.827 --> 11:43.795
Did I say you could watch my legs?

12:13.492 --> 12:16.193
- Aren't they amazing?
- Incredible.

12:16.294 --> 12:19.596
- Are you a teacher here?
- Me? No, I just started a couple weeks ago.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.331
See?

12:22.432 --> 12:24.400
How about you?

12:24.502 --> 12:27.971
Oh, I was just picking up a
prescription down the street.

12:28.071 --> 12:30.106
Oh, come on, join. We can be tap buddies.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.141
You got the legs for it.

12:32.242 --> 12:34.209
- No.
- Honey, those things are fierce.

12:34.310 --> 12:37.479
I did some cheerleading in high school.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.516
- Me, too.
- Really?

12:41.584 --> 12:43.919
There was nothing as
fun as that, was there?

12:44.020 --> 12:45.253
You know what?

12:45.354 --> 12:49.290
Tap is like cheerleading for adults.

12:52.361 --> 12:56.197
R-o-w-d-y!

12:56.298 --> 12:57.532
Come on.

13:05.274 --> 13:07.841
- What happened?
- I guess I ran over something.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.943
No, that was slashed.

13:10.045 --> 13:12.379
- Really?
- Yeah. Who would do that?

13:12.480 --> 13:13.713
What the hell is going on around here?

13:13.814 --> 13:16.016
I'm really sorry to call you,

13:16.117 --> 13:18.385
but Emmett already left for work,

13:18.486 --> 13:21.588
- and Bay is at this art class.
- The tow truck's on its way.

13:21.689 --> 13:23.489
It'll be here in about an hour.

13:23.590 --> 13:25.691
John.

13:25.792 --> 13:29.462
The thing is I have to be at the clinic

13:29.563 --> 13:33.566
to start my community
service in, like, 20 minutes.

13:35.536 --> 13:36.769
Get in.

13:40.306 --> 13:42.774
And shuffle step, shuffle step.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.877
Let's shuffle off to buffalo.

13:45.978 --> 13:47.679
Step, shuffle, step. Step, shuffle, tap.

13:47.780 --> 13:50.348
- You're a ringer.
- I used to do a little ballet.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.251
I did a little ballet
dancer. His name was Trevor.

13:53.352 --> 13:54.651
Turn!

13:54.752 --> 13:58.189
- Who's talking?
- She was.

14:00.858 --> 14:02.826
Okay, so I'll see you next week.

14:02.927 --> 14:06.163
Hi. My name is Daphne Vasquez.
I'm here for community service.

14:06.264 --> 14:09.600
I'm supposed to ask for Jorge.

14:09.701 --> 14:11.434
- I'm Jorge.
- Hi.

14:11.535 --> 14:14.304
Ok, let me get you started
with some forms in the back.

14:14.405 --> 14:18.408
- Sorry again for being late. Somebody slashed my tires.
- Late?

14:18.509 --> 14:19.775
What time are you supposed to be here?

14:19.876 --> 14:23.546
- 3:30.
- It's 3:49.

14:23.647 --> 14:25.281
You were sent by the court?

14:25.382 --> 14:27.983
What do you think this
is, a sorority party?

14:28.084 --> 14:30.319
A sorry party?

14:30.420 --> 14:33.455
I'm deaf and sometimes
I have trouble reading...

14:33.556 --> 14:36.024
Your probation officer
assigned you to this clinic

14:36.126 --> 14:38.093
as a term of your probation.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.762
That means if you neglect
to take this seriously,

14:40.863 --> 14:42.664
you can and will go back to court

14:42.765 --> 14:45.066
and will be thrown in juvenile hall.

14:45.167 --> 14:48.036
- Do I make myself clear?
- Absolutely. Yes.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.639
You kids, you come in here
thinking this is some kind of joke?

14:50.740 --> 14:52.907
- Dr. J.
- What?

14:53.009 --> 14:55.977
I'm sorry, Campbell.

14:56.078 --> 14:59.747
I just wanted to talk to you
about that patient in room 5.

14:59.848 --> 15:02.582
She was asking about getting
a ride back here for next week.

15:02.684 --> 15:05.819
I just wanted to know
the procedure on that.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.220
I'll talk to her.

15:12.961 --> 15:15.528
- Okay, so...
- Oh, my God.

15:15.629 --> 15:17.030
That was the director of the clinic

15:17.131 --> 15:18.564
and one of our volunteers.

15:18.666 --> 15:20.299
If you're still breathing,

15:20.400 --> 15:22.869
I can give you the rest of the tour.

15:22.970 --> 15:26.539
I've been trying to convert
everything to pounds.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.975
Plus the metric system and the shoe sizes,

15:29.076 --> 15:31.109
and the time difference.

15:32.478 --> 15:35.847
You're right. You're right.

15:35.948 --> 15:38.516
I'm sure I'll be fine.

15:38.617 --> 15:40.852
Okay, talk to you later.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.058
Okay, so what's going on?

15:46.159 --> 15:48.793
You remember the trade show
that I went to in Philly?

15:48.894 --> 15:51.996
- When I was there, I met...
- you told me.

15:52.097 --> 15:55.066
Conrad, the photographer, who
you met at the Indian restaurant.

15:55.167 --> 15:59.036
I'm moving to London. Believe me.

15:59.137 --> 16:00.971
My mom, my sister, all my girlfriends,

16:01.073 --> 16:02.953
are all telling me that
I'm moving way too fast,

16:03.007 --> 16:05.942
but I just know if I don't try it,

16:06.043 --> 16:08.945
really try it, I'll always wonder.

16:09.046 --> 16:12.348
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.818
Yeah. Wow.

16:17.054 --> 16:18.287
I'm gonna sell this place.

16:18.388 --> 16:21.023
Oh.

16:21.124 --> 16:22.825
I have loved having you.

16:22.926 --> 16:26.460
You're a great asset. I will
give you an amazing reference.

16:31.066 --> 16:33.201
This is exciting news.

16:33.301 --> 16:36.270
- I'm gonna get this.
- Okay.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.571
Hi...

16:40.609 --> 16:43.444
Now, cubism, I've always
said, is best understood

16:43.545 --> 16:46.247
under the influence of some
sort of mind-altering...

16:46.348 --> 16:48.349
- ma'am.
- Yes.

16:48.450 --> 16:50.784
Oh, wow we went way over.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.554
Hold on. Hold on. Listen,
you have an assignment.

16:53.655 --> 16:55.322
I want you to draw a portrait

16:55.423 --> 16:57.990
of the person next to you on your left.

16:58.091 --> 17:01.594
That's not gonna work. Okay,
you two, you two and you two.

17:01.695 --> 17:05.265
You get it. This isn't
just about lines and shapes.

17:05.366 --> 17:08.166
I want you to study the unique
qualities in your partner

17:08.269 --> 17:09.801
and bring out their essence.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.103
Okay, enough.

17:11.204 --> 17:14.406
Go. Fly away. You're free.

17:14.507 --> 17:16.241
Hi. I'm Bay.

17:16.342 --> 17:19.744
- Like what horses do?
- Wolves, actually. Wolves bay at the moon.

17:19.845 --> 17:22.647
It's better than quack. You
could've been named quack.

17:22.749 --> 17:26.217
- That is true.
- Or yap. Or maw. Maw.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.887
- Could've been a lot worse.
- Yeah.

17:28.988 --> 17:30.354
So I could do tomorrow evening.

17:30.455 --> 17:32.856
Like around 8:00. Maybe
we can meet at a cafe.

17:32.957 --> 17:35.826
Yeah, I'm on pledge duty.
So can't leave the house.

17:35.927 --> 17:38.529
- That's gonna be a problem.
- No, you can come to me.

17:38.630 --> 17:41.332
I'm supposed to just show up at
a fraternity house alone at night.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.753
Dude, I'm just gonna be studying
in the commons room, okay?

17:43.802 --> 17:47.370
- We're not all cavemen.
- Okay, fine.

17:47.471 --> 17:49.572
- I can come.
- Omega Psi!

17:49.674 --> 17:51.474
- I get that.
- Bye.

17:51.575 --> 17:54.177
Bye! Bye!

17:54.278 --> 17:55.878
Classic.

17:58.253 --> 17:59.867
All right. So we serve
about 300 people a day.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.081
We do pre-natal care, eye exams,

18:02.182 --> 18:03.983
dental services, wellness center.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.020
Darius. Good guy to know.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.822
Dr. Weiss, ophthalmologist.

18:09.924 --> 18:12.224
- Am I going too fast?
- No, I'm good.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.826
You sure? First time here
can be a little bit hectic.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.931
Yeah, I spent a lot of time
in free clinics growing up.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.433
- How is that?
- I grew up in East Riverside.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.702
No kidding. What part?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.537
14th and Montgomery.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.839
- ¿Habla español?
- I do.

18:27.941 --> 18:31.241
Pero no leo labios en español muy bien.

18:31.342 --> 18:33.578
Wow, that accent was painful.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.780
I've been told.

18:35.881 --> 18:39.283
I'm deaf so the nuances sort of elude me.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.786
Okay, English it is.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.154
Look, I'll be your direct supervisor.

18:44.255 --> 18:46.422
Check in with me when you get
here, check in when you're done.

18:46.523 --> 18:49.826
- Are you a doctor?
- Hell, no. Nurse practitioner.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.427
But I'm pretty much the
general guy in charge here.

18:51.528 --> 18:52.968
I'll get you started on the showers.

18:53.064 --> 18:54.831
- Showers?
- For the homeless.

18:54.932 --> 18:57.500
- We also give out toiletry bags,
- There's no socks.

18:57.602 --> 19:00.837
- There used to be socks.
- Yeah, we stopped handing those out.

19:00.938 --> 19:03.171
I've have an extra pair in my backpack.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.241
- Ew... eww.
- No, they're clean.

19:06.342 --> 19:07.610
I can get them, if you want.

19:09.145 --> 19:12.380
- Yeah, okay.
- A "thank you" works, too.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.717
Thank you.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.952
Go. Shower.

19:17.053 --> 19:19.320
She'll have them ready when you're done.

19:20.489 --> 19:23.091
Okay, look... you gotta
be careful, all right?

19:23.251 --> 19:26.520
You keep doing that, you'll probably
end up naked by the end of the day.

19:26.621 --> 19:29.557
At least I did something right today.

19:32.402 --> 19:34.203
Daphne texted that there was a fight.

19:34.228 --> 19:37.330
All these new kids are
what, juvenile delinquents?

19:37.431 --> 19:39.599
Tire was slashed the
first day back at school.

19:40.217 --> 19:42.235
____

19:43.109 --> 19:46.149
- No, wait a second.
- Will you give her a chance to explain the situation...

19:46.174 --> 19:49.576
I am trying to. She is signing too fast.

19:49.677 --> 19:52.011
Okay.

19:52.112 --> 19:54.947
Three schools in the district
were under-performing,

19:55.048 --> 19:56.415
so they had to be closed.

19:56.516 --> 20:00.285
The kids had to be
redistributed to other schools.

20:00.386 --> 20:02.955
Carlton, because it's under-populated,

20:03.056 --> 20:04.757
got a bunch of these students.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.024
Okay.

20:06.125 --> 20:08.292
Now the murky part is why Carlton

20:08.393 --> 20:12.296
got all the discipline
problems and underachievers.

20:12.397 --> 20:15.499
I'm pulling the girls and I'm
putting them back at Buckner.

20:15.601 --> 20:19.104
Buckner doesn't have the resources
for Daphne. You know that.

20:19.205 --> 20:21.305
- We'll get her an interpreter.
- She doesn't want someone

20:21.406 --> 20:23.073
following her around all day.

20:23.174 --> 20:26.210
I think Bay would rather see
pigs fly than go back there.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.945
What do you want me to do?

20:28.479 --> 20:31.510
____

20:31.515 --> 20:33.951
- She wants us to all...
- I got it.

20:42.292 --> 20:44.861
Damn it.

20:44.962 --> 20:47.263
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:47.364 --> 20:50.399
- I'm Campbell.
- Daphne.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.534
I just missed my bus.

20:52.636 --> 20:54.369
Would you like a ride?

20:54.470 --> 20:57.572
Like on your lap?

20:57.673 --> 21:01.243
Like in my Camaro.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.612
Oh, right. Of course.

21:06.482 --> 21:09.917
So this is a dumb question,

21:10.018 --> 21:12.619
but how do you drive it?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.621
Hand controls.

21:14.722 --> 21:18.292
This bar here is connected
to the gas and the brake.

21:18.393 --> 21:20.261
Cool.

21:21.396 --> 21:24.799
You're a volunteer, too, right?

21:24.900 --> 21:27.533
Are you part of the program?

21:27.634 --> 21:30.670
Are you asking am I a convicted felon,

21:30.771 --> 21:32.672
like you?

21:32.773 --> 21:36.042
Nah. Just a pre-med student.

21:36.143 --> 21:37.811
Sophomore.

21:37.912 --> 21:40.646
Sounds like you looked me up
after Dr. Jackass yelled at me.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.249
Dr. J, he's actually not a bad guy.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.319
- He's seen me through nine lives.
- How's that?

21:47.420 --> 21:51.290
Well, before this last crash,

21:51.390 --> 21:55.260
I broke my collarbone,

21:55.361 --> 21:58.595
my wrist, ruptured spleen

21:58.697 --> 22:00.664
and three concussions.

22:00.765 --> 22:03.167
Motorcycles? ATVs?

22:03.268 --> 22:05.970
Snowboarding. You ever been?

22:06.071 --> 22:08.906
And now I'm not sure I want to.

22:09.007 --> 22:10.208
It's a blast.

22:10.309 --> 22:13.944
As long as you don't do
anything crazy like me,

22:14.045 --> 22:16.679
you'll be fine. Then again,

22:16.780 --> 22:19.883
the crazy stuff was the best part.

22:23.087 --> 22:25.555
All set?

22:25.656 --> 22:29.092
Yeah, of course, thank you.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.003
- So you're deaf.
- Yeah.

22:41.104 --> 22:44.539
Look at us. A gimp and a deaf girl.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.308
That sounds like the
start of a really bad joke.

22:50.346 --> 22:53.081
Hey, Ella, you ok?

22:57.019 --> 22:58.619
She's homeless, that girl?

22:58.720 --> 23:03.290
Yeah, she got kicked out of her house.

23:03.391 --> 23:05.425
- For what?
- Not sure.

23:05.526 --> 23:07.127
But you'll see that a lot around here.

23:07.228 --> 23:11.163
Parents throw their kids out all
the time for all kinds of reasons.

23:13.133 --> 23:14.401
Damn.

23:17.037 --> 23:20.373
- Hey.
- How was the big pow wow at Melody's house?

23:20.474 --> 23:24.343
I was just trying to keep your dad
from having another heart attack.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.577
How are you feeling about school?

23:25.678 --> 23:29.147
You know what? I left Buckner,

23:29.248 --> 23:30.749
I fought to keep Carlton deaf.

23:30.850 --> 23:34.286
I don't have any hate
school energy left in me.

23:34.387 --> 23:36.555
So I'm just gonna dig in

23:36.656 --> 23:38.424
and hold on till graduation.

23:38.525 --> 23:41.191
Fair enough.

23:41.293 --> 23:43.561
I, Um...

23:43.662 --> 23:45.863
I wanted to ask you something.

23:45.964 --> 23:47.064
About Ty.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.768
You broke up.

23:54.805 --> 23:56.105
Who told you that?

23:56.206 --> 23:59.440
No one. What happened?

24:00.943 --> 24:03.478
I don't know. We just decided to.

24:03.579 --> 24:07.415
He's there. I'm here.
It's so not a big deal.

24:07.517 --> 24:09.450
It is a big deal.

24:09.552 --> 24:11.019
He was your first.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.022
Honestly, I am fine.

24:15.123 --> 24:17.992
Okay.

24:18.092 --> 24:20.360
I know when to let up.

24:20.461 --> 24:23.831
In fact, I've I gotta go
start looking for a new job.

24:23.932 --> 24:25.533
Wait. What?

24:25.634 --> 24:29.201
My boss just told me that she is selling
the business and moving to London.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.639
No. Who's gonna buy the business?

24:32.740 --> 24:34.774
Probably someone who doesn't want me there.

24:34.875 --> 24:37.276
I finally found something
that I am good at,

24:37.377 --> 24:41.147
- a place I thought I could stay for a while and...
- Why don't you buy it?

24:41.248 --> 24:44.350
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

24:44.451 --> 24:46.585
Angelo would buy it for you.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.420
Or you could buy it with your own money.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.723
Lawsuit, big settlement,
marriage, community property.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.962
Regina, you ran your own business out
of your house for years successfully.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.565
You have millions of ideas.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.633
I'm sure that you could do this.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.735
Huh.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.905
Huh.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.008
Just remember, it was my idea.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.110
Yeah.

25:20.284 --> 25:23.653
Hey, I heard about your tire.

25:23.754 --> 25:25.121
How'd you get home?

25:25.222 --> 25:27.791
I got a ride from another volunteer.

25:27.892 --> 25:30.026
I didn't want to bother anyone

25:30.127 --> 25:33.796
to drive all the way
out there and pick me up.

25:33.897 --> 25:35.598
I'm not doing anything special.

25:35.699 --> 25:39.569
So how'd it go at the clinic?

25:39.669 --> 25:42.705
Four hours down, 96 to go.

25:44.208 --> 25:48.077
I can't believe that my sister

25:48.178 --> 25:50.178
has a probation officer.

25:53.015 --> 25:55.650
John hates me.

25:55.811 --> 25:58.680
What?

25:58.781 --> 26:00.782
I could do a thousand hours,

26:00.883 --> 26:02.950
and he would never forgive me.

26:03.108 --> 26:05.109
That is not true.

26:05.210 --> 26:08.945
Kids get thrown out of their houses
all the time. Did you know that?

26:09.046 --> 26:11.248
John is not gonna throw you out.

26:11.349 --> 26:15.218
He and I just met not even two years ago.

26:15.319 --> 26:16.720
It doesn't matter. He is your dad.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.222
Yeah, believe me, dads walk out.

26:27.764 --> 26:31.967
What I did was a huge screw-up.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.470
I know that.

26:34.571 --> 26:37.605
I just feel like everything we had...

26:39.541 --> 26:41.909
has just vanished.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.916
You guys had a really

26:49.017 --> 26:52.920
good relationship before, right?

26:53.021 --> 26:56.456
Like when he coached your basketball team.

26:56.557 --> 26:57.791
You guys won the tournament.

26:57.892 --> 27:01.227
That was a million years ago.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.397
Maybe you need

27:03.498 --> 27:05.565
to find a way

27:05.667 --> 27:08.968
to remind him of that.

27:22.568 --> 27:23.958
____

27:23.959 --> 27:28.001
____

27:28.002 --> 27:30.370

27:30.371 --> 27:32.320

27:32.321 --> 27:33.564

27:33.565 --> 27:37.385

27:39.615 --> 27:42.520

27:42.521 --> 27:46.261
- ____
- ____

27:51.442 --> 27:56.260
____

27:56.261 --> 27:57.772
____

28:05.540 --> 28:06.907
What you shaking your head at me for?

28:07.008 --> 28:09.476
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. What?

28:09.543 --> 28:12.178
Somebody slashed my tire yesterday.

28:12.279 --> 28:14.080
You think I did that?

28:14.181 --> 28:16.516
How would I even know
what kind of car you got?

28:16.617 --> 28:18.117
I'd have to be some kind
of magician, wouldn't I?

28:18.218 --> 28:20.119
I'm sure you could find out.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.287
Is that what you told deaf lady?

28:21.388 --> 28:24.490
- That I messed up your car?
- No.

28:24.591 --> 28:26.124
I bet.

28:30.129 --> 28:33.031
So, Renzo, that sounds Italian.

28:33.132 --> 28:35.233
I wish. Mama's Filipino. Daddy's Chinese.

28:35.334 --> 28:38.269
And I'm in therapy.

28:38.371 --> 28:40.372
Wait a minute.

28:40.473 --> 28:42.707
It's my daughter. She needs socks.

28:42.808 --> 28:46.511
Yuck, kids. Whoops,
did I say that out loud?

28:46.612 --> 28:48.853
I don't know how you do it.
I mean, I know the human race

28:48.914 --> 28:50.815
is supposed to continue and everything,

28:50.916 --> 28:54.118
but damn if I'm gonna give up my
wiggling Wednesdays or thumping Thursdays

28:54.219 --> 28:57.020
- for anybody.
- Your what?

28:57.121 --> 29:00.256
Wednesdays I go hula
hooping. I do. Don't laugh.

29:00.357 --> 29:04.093
It makes your waist teeny
tiny. And then on Thursdays,

29:04.194 --> 29:06.897
if the weather's right and
we get enough folks out there,

29:06.998 --> 29:08.431
we do a drum circle.

29:08.533 --> 29:11.234
Oh, there's one tomorrow.
You should come with me.

29:11.335 --> 29:12.902
A drum circle?

29:13.003 --> 29:15.604
Yeah, some folks rock the tambourines.

29:15.705 --> 29:18.773
Some other people chant. It's
like a total spiritual experience.

29:18.874 --> 29:20.274
I'm telling you, you gotta try it.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.335
It's even better than tap,
'cause there's alcohol.

29:24.146 --> 29:25.780
I can't.

29:25.881 --> 29:28.750
My husband has a charity
event for a colleague.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.919
Some rubber chicken dinner.
Can't you blow it off?

29:33.923 --> 29:36.289
- No.
- All righty, then.

29:36.390 --> 29:37.958
Your loss.

29:38.059 --> 29:42.062
Hello.

29:42.163 --> 29:43.964
- Angelo Sorrento.
- Yes.

29:44.065 --> 29:46.433
This is Christy Salz, Barbara's daughter.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.301
I just got out of a meeting with
the builder for the restaurant.

29:48.402 --> 29:50.103
I don't know who came up with
the budget for this thing.

29:50.204 --> 29:52.438
- Wait, who is this?
- This is Barbara's daughter.

29:52.539 --> 29:53.639
I'll be taking over this project.

29:53.740 --> 29:55.608
Why? What happened to Barbara?

29:55.709 --> 29:56.583
Have you seen the stove?

29:56.584 --> 29:58.859
And the bathrooms look like
they're out of a bus station.

29:58.862 --> 30:01.113
I mean, if you want a classy
place, you need classy bathrooms.

30:01.214 --> 30:02.582
Can you slow down a little?

30:02.683 --> 30:04.416
So I got kitchen equipment, wine inventory.

30:04.517 --> 30:06.151
The budget's up to 1.7 million,

30:06.252 --> 30:08.620
which honestly, is not that unreasonable.

30:08.676 --> 30:12.112
- It'll be another 350k each.
- Are you kidding?

30:12.213 --> 30:14.214
Look, I'm happy to buy you
out and find another partner

30:14.316 --> 30:15.582
if you don't see eye
to eye with my choices.

30:15.683 --> 30:19.186
I got it. I got it.

30:19.287 --> 30:21.188
But no more, okay? This is it.

30:21.289 --> 30:22.956
See, I can't promise you that.

30:23.057 --> 30:25.325
But you're in it this deep, you
might as well see it through, right?

30:25.426 --> 30:28.727
All right, all right.

30:28.829 --> 30:31.431
Great. I will need your check
by next Tuesday. Take care.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.947
Coming through!

30:49.048 --> 30:51.216
Bay, what up?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.785
B-B-B-Bay!

30:53.886 --> 30:56.820
Hello, there. So where are we setting up?

30:56.921 --> 30:59.390
Nelson and the Walkstar.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.893
- Go wipe down the urinal, pledge.
- Yes, sir.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.031
- Hello.
- Hey.

31:07.132 --> 31:10.067
Hi, so love a kegger
as much as the next gal,

31:10.168 --> 31:13.169
but this is our first assignment.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.872
Just grab some punch and chill
out, okay? We'll get to it.

31:15.973 --> 31:19.175
I'm working tonight.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.582
You made it!

31:35.525 --> 31:37.326
Surprise!

31:37.427 --> 31:39.661
Mary Beth!

31:39.762 --> 31:41.497
I am so glad that you came.

31:41.597 --> 31:43.831
Totally. My dorm is like right there.

31:43.932 --> 31:46.867
I can't stay long. I'm meeting
Travis there in ten minutes.

31:46.968 --> 31:49.570
Oh. So how are you? How's college?

31:49.671 --> 31:51.005
Spectacular. Seriously.

31:51.106 --> 31:53.707
There is a cereal bar in the cafeteria.

31:53.808 --> 31:57.512
I'm taking a fencing class.
It's everything I hoped for.

31:57.612 --> 32:00.047
- I cannot wait.
- How's everything else?

32:00.114 --> 32:02.449
It's good. It's fine.

32:05.786 --> 32:06.707
Have you talked to him?

32:06.787 --> 32:09.889
We've emailed a few times.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.991
Did he ask about me?

32:13.761 --> 32:15.394
Uh...

32:15.495 --> 32:18.830
Wow.

32:18.932 --> 32:20.732
I don't think it means anything.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.045
Ty's really busy,

32:22.046 --> 32:24.103
and I don't think he'd talk
to me about you anyway since...

32:24.104 --> 32:25.438
No, I shouldn't have asked.

32:25.539 --> 32:27.606
Never let me ask about him again.

32:27.707 --> 32:28.740
Okay? Please.

32:30.944 --> 32:34.712
Look, Bay, there's something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

32:34.813 --> 32:37.048
You know what I need? I need to
find the cutest guy at this party

32:37.149 --> 32:38.383
and kiss him a lot.

32:38.484 --> 32:41.219
I support that.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.054
All right.

32:43.155 --> 32:44.589
Okay.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.597
Ding, ding.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.080
Hi.

32:58.105 --> 32:59.538
Damn it, you scared me.

32:59.639 --> 33:02.075
I'm sorry.

33:02.176 --> 33:04.543
I still have a key.

33:04.644 --> 33:07.846
So I have a proposal for you.

33:07.947 --> 33:10.615
A business proposal.

33:10.716 --> 33:12.684
I want to buy K&D.

33:12.785 --> 33:16.088
Whitney is selling it,
and I was talking to Bay,

33:16.189 --> 33:18.823
and she's right, I have tons of ideas,

33:18.925 --> 33:21.425
and I know that I could
take it to the next level.

33:21.526 --> 33:24.095
You're always saying
that the money is ours.

33:24.196 --> 33:27.265
And I finally feel that way.

33:27.366 --> 33:29.733
That it is ours.

33:32.570 --> 33:33.704
What's wrong?

33:35.874 --> 33:38.975
I paid for you to go to rehab.

33:39.076 --> 33:42.845
I gave up Abby for you. Now you
want me to buy you a business?

33:42.947 --> 33:43.980
It never ends.

33:48.519 --> 33:51.854
Wait. You gave up Abby for me?

33:52.923 --> 33:54.756
You gave Abby back to Leo and Victor

33:54.857 --> 33:57.059
because you said she
was better off with them.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.529
If you had agreed to raise her
with me, it would have been fine.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.364
But I didn't want to.

34:02.465 --> 34:04.333
Was getting Lana pregnant, with Abby,

34:04.434 --> 34:06.835
was that my fault, too?

34:06.937 --> 34:08.469
Oh, my God, Angelo.

34:08.571 --> 34:10.905
You are a child.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.540
Do you know that?

34:31.692 --> 34:34.726
Hey, buddy, can I just
borrow her for a second?

34:34.829 --> 34:38.065
- Just one sec, I swear.
- Okay.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.934
Thank you.

34:42.735 --> 34:44.902
- What are you doing?
- He has beer in his room.

34:45.005 --> 34:46.705
Yeah, we all have beer in our rooms.

34:46.806 --> 34:47.906
Do you even know his name?

34:48.007 --> 34:50.976
It's Ledge. It's bluff.

34:51.078 --> 34:53.512
It's the thing when you, like, fall.

34:53.612 --> 34:55.348
- Cliff.
- Whatever.

34:55.449 --> 34:57.582
It's not like he knows my name.

34:57.638 --> 34:58.871
If you're drunk enough to
think that's a positive,

34:58.973 --> 35:01.041
you probably shouldn't be
heading back to his room.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.110
Okay, well, maybe I want to
hook up with Ledge... Cliff.

35:04.211 --> 35:06.179
And have it not mean anything.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.416
Trust me, you're gonna have a million more
chances to do that in the next four years,

35:09.516 --> 35:11.117
but right now...

35:11.218 --> 35:14.619
Okay, come on, come on. We need some air.

35:17.790 --> 35:21.827
Okay, I got your bucket right there.

35:21.928 --> 35:24.596
Oh, God. Oh, why?

35:24.697 --> 35:27.967
Why? Why? Why?

35:28.068 --> 35:30.835
Yeah, I made that punch.

35:30.936 --> 35:33.171
No.

35:33.272 --> 35:35.106
Why did he do it?

35:36.808 --> 35:39.877
Was it because...

35:39.979 --> 35:41.446
I didn't say I love you?

35:41.546 --> 35:45.248
Who? Cliff? He said he loved you?

35:45.350 --> 35:48.918
No. Ty.

35:49.020 --> 35:50.753
Ty said "I love you,"

35:50.855 --> 35:54.824
and I didn't say "I love you" back.

35:54.925 --> 35:56.593
Is that why he cheated?

35:56.694 --> 35:59.662
I'm not really the guy

35:59.763 --> 36:02.598
to ask about this kind of thing.

36:02.699 --> 36:04.633
Every time I get a text

36:04.734 --> 36:08.269
and it's not him, my stomach drops.

36:08.371 --> 36:11.672
And every time I check my email

36:11.773 --> 36:13.141
and he hasn't written...

36:16.312 --> 36:17.479
I just want to die.

36:17.579 --> 36:20.681
Doesn't he wish that he could take it back?

36:20.782 --> 36:22.984
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

36:23.085 --> 36:26.153
Then why isn't he calling?

36:26.254 --> 36:29.089
Why isn't he writing?

36:29.190 --> 36:31.025
He doesn't care enough about me

36:31.126 --> 36:34.528
that he wishes that he could

36:34.629 --> 36:38.332
could see how I'm doing
after what he did to me.

36:44.604 --> 36:46.339
Look.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.676
I don't really know jack about love.

36:50.777 --> 36:53.146
But I do know you need to go home.

36:53.247 --> 36:57.815
I'd take you, but I probably
shouldn't be driving.

36:57.917 --> 37:00.585
Do you have anybody you can call?

37:03.923 --> 37:06.991
Look, you're gonna be okay.

37:22.215 --> 37:25.451
Are those field hockey sticks?

37:25.552 --> 37:28.821
Yep, I got 15 more of them in the car.

37:28.922 --> 37:32.925
Maybe I can give them to Bay and she
could turn them into some great art piece.

37:33.026 --> 37:36.061
Or give them to John
and Kathryn for firewood.

37:39.265 --> 37:40.398
What's going on?

37:40.499 --> 37:43.501
I went to Buckner and begged Coach Medlock

37:43.602 --> 37:46.470
to let us share their basketball courts.

37:46.571 --> 37:51.008
And he gave you a bunch
of field hockey sticks?

37:51.109 --> 37:53.211
I guess that was his way of saying no.

37:53.312 --> 37:57.081
And they must have had a
bunch of extra equipment.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.051
I had this big plan.

38:01.152 --> 38:04.921
Of making the basketball team
and asking John to coach us again

38:05.022 --> 38:08.124
and relive the good ol' days.

38:08.226 --> 38:10.894
He probably would've said no anyway.

38:16.766 --> 38:20.236
As if I even know what
field hockey was anyway.

38:20.337 --> 38:21.871
I'm from East Riverside.

38:21.972 --> 38:24.573
Nobody plays field
hockey in East Riverside.

38:30.780 --> 38:32.981
- I could do it.
- What?

38:33.082 --> 38:34.249
Coach.

38:34.450 --> 38:37.585
I mean, if you're desperate.

38:37.686 --> 38:39.087
Are you serious?

38:39.188 --> 38:42.656
All I'm doing is marking time

38:42.757 --> 38:44.459
until Nikki gets back

38:44.559 --> 38:49.162
and redoing sealer wax coupons.

38:51.665 --> 38:54.868
- Do you regret getting married?
- No, no way.

38:54.969 --> 38:56.803
I love Nikki.

38:56.904 --> 39:00.340
And we're gonna make this work.

39:00.441 --> 39:04.676
Doesn't mean that I'm happy
about our current arrangement.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.413
Do you miss being in school?

39:09.391 --> 39:12.626
I miss everything.

39:13.928 --> 39:16.630
I actually miss Buckner.

39:16.731 --> 39:18.865
Can you believe that?

39:21.068 --> 39:26.706
Yeah, my life pretty much sucks right now.

39:29.676 --> 39:31.611
Mine, too.

39:38.151 --> 39:40.919
So field hockey.

39:41.020 --> 39:43.288
Field hockey.

39:46.993 --> 39:50.028
Perdonami, pardonnez-moi...

39:50.130 --> 39:52.630
in every language I know,

39:52.731 --> 39:54.565
please forgive me.

39:54.666 --> 39:57.968
I was such in a bad mood.

39:58.069 --> 39:59.770
They have to redo the pool for the house.

39:59.871 --> 40:03.073
It's gonna cost a lot more than I thought.

40:03.175 --> 40:04.475
Are we okay on money?

40:04.576 --> 40:06.810
Totally okay. We're fine.

40:07.061 --> 40:08.295
It's not a problem.

40:08.396 --> 40:11.464
Do you blame me for giving up Abby?

40:11.565 --> 40:14.033
No, that was my choice.

40:14.134 --> 40:15.568
And I know that.

40:15.670 --> 40:19.439
I'm still just working through everything.

40:19.540 --> 40:23.109
This business means a lot to you.

40:26.513 --> 40:29.114
I cannot think of a better investment

40:29.215 --> 40:31.350
for our money than you.

40:33.753 --> 40:35.487
- Really?
- Really.

40:45.354 --> 40:47.274
We've got that charity
thing tomorrow for Gerald.

40:47.299 --> 40:50.368
- What is it again, hunger?
- Kidneys.

40:50.469 --> 40:51.836
The whole lot of them.

40:51.937 --> 40:54.305
In the cafeteria, talking behind my back,

40:54.406 --> 40:56.640
saying that I put Daphne
up to that whole thing.

40:56.741 --> 40:59.643
I'm sure some new gossip will
kick that to the back burner soon.

40:59.744 --> 41:02.779
I hate to spend my Thursday
night eating overcooked prime rib

41:02.880 --> 41:04.481
and bidding on things we don't need.

41:04.582 --> 41:07.183
Why don't we just blow it off?

41:07.284 --> 41:10.153
I can't do that. I gotta be there.

41:10.254 --> 41:13.456
Well, you gotta be there,
but can't I skip it?

41:13.557 --> 41:16.325
What are you talking about?

41:18.695 --> 41:21.296
I normally wouldn't say anything,

41:21.398 --> 41:23.399
but Connie got dumped

41:23.500 --> 41:25.801
- by her boyfriend.
- Again?

41:25.902 --> 41:28.583
Yeah, and she wants me to come over
tomorrow night and talk about it

41:28.605 --> 41:30.138
'cause she's really down.

41:30.240 --> 41:34.609
So can't you just do this
dinner alone just this one time?

41:34.710 --> 41:38.180
Kathryn, what? No.

41:38.281 --> 41:40.916
You have to come with me. Come on.

41:41.017 --> 41:43.352
Please.

41:43.452 --> 41:45.519
Just this once?

41:48.257 --> 41:49.456
Okay.

41:55.864 --> 41:58.799
- Frat house?
- Don't ask.

41:58.901 --> 42:01.501
- Hey, there. Drink this.
- Okay.

42:01.602 --> 42:05.071
And down. Watch it. Be careful.

42:06.240 --> 42:09.309
What? What? Why are there sticks here?

42:09.410 --> 42:11.444
Those are field hockey sticks.

42:13.480 --> 42:17.383
- What's field hockey?
- It's a sport at Carlton that you're joining.

42:17.483 --> 42:20.019
- Ha! That's very funny.
- I'm serious.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.887
We're forming a team. We need bodies.

42:21.988 --> 42:23.923
I'm sorry. Have you met me?

42:24.024 --> 42:26.125
- She could be goalie!
- That's a great idea.

42:26.226 --> 42:28.527
All you gotta do is throw your body
in front of anything that moves.

42:28.628 --> 42:31.463
That seems like a good idea.

42:31.564 --> 42:33.697
Come on! Where's your Kennish spirit?

42:33.799 --> 42:37.701
I'm a Vasquez...
