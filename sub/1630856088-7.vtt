WEBVTT

00:33.367 --> 00:34.368
What the f--

00:39.081 --> 00:40.999
What do you think Dad was doing out there?

00:42.251 --> 00:43.252
I don't know.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.296
I mean,
he's not working for Monarch anymore.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.842
So, what?
Was he chasing Godzilla on his own?

00:49.842 --> 00:51.718
Why? For fun?

00:52.636 --> 00:56.557
I've never flown first class.
Do you think we will be in those pods?

00:57.307 --> 00:58.392
Pods?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.269
Who gives a shit about pods?

01:02.104 --> 01:03.939
Who gives a shit about him?

01:03.939 --> 01:05.691
He took one look at us and ran away.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.485
Well, maybe he was trying
to get away from Godzilla.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.279
And left us behind to get stomped on?

01:10.279 --> 01:11.405
How is that better?

01:12.823 --> 01:16.702
At least I got a first-class plane ticket
out of May for screwing us over.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.038
Where is she?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.876
She went to the bathroom,
like, 40 minutes ago.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.670
What did you expect?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.922
You told her
to stay the hell away from you.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.322
I've never been kidnapped before,

01:53.322 --> 01:55.449
so how does this work?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.505
Okay. Wait here.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.220
May, are you in here?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.269
Look, I'm sorry I told you to go to hell.

03:48.854 --> 03:49.855
May?

04:08.165 --> 04:11.376
She wasn't in there,
but I found her passport and her phone.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.420
Wait, wait. Maybe she forgot it?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.089
May? Our May?

04:21.470 --> 04:24.431
They say transport will be there
when we land.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.478
He said he'll let us know.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.946
I don't know.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.491
Writing code is like being an artist,
you know?

04:42.491 --> 04:46.453
You have your studio, you work alone,
you're the boss.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.455
The boss of your parents' basement.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.916
Okay, basements are underrated.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.793
Basements are the new garages.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.253
I remember those days.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.090
Marathon coding sessions,
you're buzzed on caffeine.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.509
So deep in,
you don't know how long you've been at it.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.553
Till the sun comes up, pulling you out.

05:03.095 --> 05:06.014
Or your mum coming down to do the laundry.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.269
Here we go.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.690
What?

05:14.690 --> 05:16.233
The end of the second bottle.

05:16.233 --> 05:20.737
It's when you give your big sales pitch
and tell me how brilliant I am

05:20.737 --> 05:24.992
and how I'm wasting my talent
when I could be saving the world at AET.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.077
And the money.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.829
Of course, there's money.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.831
So it's not your first rodeo then.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.750
No, but this is by far
one of the best meals.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.547
Well, you missed the most
important part where, quite frankly...

05:41.341 --> 05:42.718
girl, I'm tired.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.308
And I know you are too,
of being the only one.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.899
Look, you are brilliant,
and you can work anywhere.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.446
But I think the future looks better

06:03.614 --> 06:06.742
if you create it with me.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.789
And, girl, there is a lot of money.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.836
Cheers.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.839
You check in with airport security,

06:20.839 --> 06:22.716
and I'm gonna see
if she checked in for a flight.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.593
This isn't your classroom, Ms. Randa.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.720
Well, I'm still the older sibling,
so deal with it.

06:28.597 --> 06:29.598
No way.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.977
You!

06:33.977 --> 06:35.854
You-- Where is she?

06:36.355 --> 06:37.814
What did you do with her?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.107
Damn it!

06:43.195 --> 06:48.158
I have had a very weird day.

06:48.951 --> 06:52.538
So, maybe you could just
take it a little easy, okay?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.081
Thank you.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.707
Where is May?

06:59.378 --> 07:02.548
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for us?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.220
Actually, I'm trying to get hydrated,

07:08.220 --> 07:10.764
figure out a way
to get the hell out of here.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.099
How are you?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.517
You came after us with guns.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.813
No. We came after Shaw,
and you were supposed to go home.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.106
Remember that?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.316
What about the deal May made
with your partner?

07:21.316 --> 07:23.610
What deal? What?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.989
The deal. You know what I'm talking about.

07:26.989 --> 07:31.785
Look, my partner and I,
we're having some issues.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.162
Issues? Issues?

07:34.162 --> 07:37.207
People died out there.
Is that who you people are?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.168
Thank you.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.463
No, that is not who we are.

07:45.048 --> 07:49.636
Look, your grandparents, they created
something extraordinary in Monarch.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.931
They were fearless enough to believe

07:53.432 --> 07:59.521
that the world is so much more vast
than we could possibly imagine.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.859
And they were humble enough
to accept our tiny place in it.

08:05.527 --> 08:10.574
Your father,
he opened my eyes to that world.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.579
What was he doing out there?

08:16.788 --> 08:17.789
What do you mean?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.167
He was here?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.752
Was. He ran off.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.213
He had some machine set up.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.423
And then Godzilla woke up and--

08:26.423 --> 08:28.217
But wait, what machine?

08:31.261 --> 08:32.513
Is that what he was doing?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.725
Was he trying to wake up Godzilla?

08:36.725 --> 08:40.062
No. Your father spent his life
trying to prevent

08:40.062 --> 08:42.188
something like G-day from happening.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.235
I believe that
he's trying to prevent the next one.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.697
Prove it.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.825
Monarch seems to be plugged in
all over the world.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.494
So, help us find May...

08:58.372 --> 09:00.541
and we'll help you find Shaw.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.334
Excuse us. We're gonna go talk.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.253
Brother-sister stuff.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.050
Brother-sister stuff?

09:11.093 --> 09:12.261
You're asking him for help?

09:12.261 --> 09:14.179
Our options feel
kind of limited right now.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.306
They're gonna wanna find Dad.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.599
I don't wanna find Dad.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.811
We don't even know what he was
doing out there or why he ran off.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.272
Kentaro, we can't just quit now.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.273
Yes, I can.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.318
I started this crazy quest thinking
that he might be able to explain this.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.362
I don't believe that anymore.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.032
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>
- I am--

09:34.700 --> 09:39.830
Well, I'm at the airport
in Algeria still, I think.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.956
<i>Where's Sabitha?</i>

09:40.956 --> 09:42.875
We can't contact anyone on the team.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.085
<i>No, you wouldn't be able to
because they're--</i>

09:45.669 --> 09:46.670
they're gone.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.965
Sabitha, the whole team, really.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.508
<i>They're gone.</i>

09:53.594 --> 09:54.595
What happened?

09:55.721 --> 09:59.266
<i>Godzilla happened, actually. He was here.</i>

10:07.691 --> 10:10.235
You're sure?

10:10.235 --> 10:11.612
Kind of hard to miss.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.988
Majestic, terrifying.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.324
Stay where you are.
I'm sending a team to bring you in.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.658
<i>No, I can't. I--</i>

10:16.658 --> 10:17.743
Why not?

10:17.743 --> 10:20.370
The Randa kids are here.
I need to help them do something first.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.831
Also, I might need to piggyback
some Monarch resources.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.708
<i>I don't have any resources to piggyback.</i>

10:24.708 --> 10:28.462
Get your ass on a plane and report
to the nearest Monarch base now.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.715
<i>If Godzilla's on the move,
we need a full debrief.</i>

10:31.715 --> 10:34.801
He was huge. He appeared out of nowhere

10:34.801 --> 10:37.596
and then he disappeared--
guess what-- into nowhere.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.056
So, consider yourself briefed.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.099
Consider yourself suspended.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.559
<i>I'm suspended? Okay, great.</i>

10:42.559 --> 10:45.229
<i>Then I can speak freely because
I think that you should hear this.</i>

10:45.229 --> 10:49.274
Had you not treated these kids
like criminals, like I said,

10:49.274 --> 10:54.029
then they might have led us to Godzilla
instead of running to Shaw.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.240
<i>That's why I have to help them.</i>

10:56.240 --> 10:57.324
Help them do what?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.701
I have to help them
find their friend May Hewitt.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.120
They think that we kidnapped her.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.165
We didn't kidnap her, did we?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.792
Not that I'm aware of.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.546
<i>And have you told them
the truth about their friend May?</i>

11:12.840 --> 11:14.383
Can we please just find May first?

11:15.133 --> 11:16.760
What if she doesn't want to be found?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.929
Well, then she can tell us
to eat shit and die.

11:19.638 --> 11:23.141
But after all we've been through, she
owes us an eat-shit-and-die to our faces.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.439
Tell me you really don't care
what happens to her,

11:29.439 --> 11:33.944
and we can take our first-class tickets
and climb into our pods and go home.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.603
You see that? There and there.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.522
It's the same isotopic signature as G-day,

12:10.522 --> 12:12.733
but the transmission rate is really funky.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.693
- Funky?
- Yeah.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.487
Not like sour-milk funky or something.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.367
I'm not, like,
trying to step on your turf.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.537
I'm, like, a big advocate
of remote work. Trust me.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.540
But the gamma-ray signatures
I was picking up,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.626
they're all peaking at the Alaska Rift, so...

12:30.626 --> 12:32.085
- Here you are.
- Here I am...

12:33.670 --> 12:35.130
freezing my ass off.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.135
Gotta pee.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.732
What the hell?

13:09.581 --> 13:11.917
Good afternoon.
Could we have your attention, please?

13:11.917 --> 13:14.795
What's going on here? What is this?

13:15.671 --> 13:16.672
Who the hell are you?

13:18.549 --> 13:22.427
My name
is Colonel Leland Lafayette Shaw III,

13:23.428 --> 13:25.889
and your base is now under my control.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.601
You all may leave whenever you want.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.103
You all know where the doors are,

13:31.687 --> 13:34.565
which we will be locking down
for operational security.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.150
But before that happens,

13:38.151 --> 13:41.488
you each have a decision to make.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.282
A choice.

13:44.575 --> 13:47.995
Now, you can go on
as if the world hasn't changed,

13:47.995 --> 13:50.622
pretending that humanity
didn't just wake up

13:50.622 --> 13:54.293
and suddenly find itself
on the endangered species list,

13:55.294 --> 14:01.341
or you can stand with us
on the right side of history.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.696
It's Barnes. I'm at Outpost 47-- 87.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.740
Eighty-eight. It doesn't matter. Okay.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.034
I need to speak
to Deputy Director Verdugo.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.994
No, I can't hold.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.110
Okay.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.738
Can't make any promises,

15:04.738 --> 15:07.950
but I will do whatever I can
to help you find your friend.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.409
In exchange for what?

15:10.702 --> 15:11.870
Just give us a chance.

15:12.371 --> 15:13.789
Did you really know our dad?

15:14.498 --> 15:16.500
He was one of the first people
that I met at Monarch.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.586
He was quiet, private.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.463
I didn't even know that he had two kids.

15:23.924 --> 15:24.925
Scary smart.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.555
He wouldn't say anything for a while--
you'd almost forget he was in the room--

15:29.555 --> 15:33.559
then chime in with some perspective that
would turn the whole thing on its head.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.103
The guy, he didn't miss a trick.

15:36.103 --> 15:40.482
I mean, he used to write everything
down with these little pencil stubs.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.818
Shavings everywhere.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.367
Okay.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.289
May told me if anything happened to her,
I should call her sister.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.749
Can you run a search?

15:59.585 --> 16:00.419
Yeah.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.006
I should tell you

16:04.590 --> 16:07.217
we did background checks on all of you
while you were in custody.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.680
The passport that she is using is fake.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.518
<i>Her real name is not May.</i>

16:17.936 --> 16:18.937
<i>What is it?</i>

16:20.898 --> 16:23.483
Corah,
I've been meaning to check in on you.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.445
Really? I've been trying to
see you for, like, a month.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.114
Sorry about that.
This rebranding thing has been insane.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.200
I'm holding Walter's hand 24/7.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.367
Yeah, I bet.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.452
Hey, Brenda, I--

16:33.452 --> 16:36.538
I do have to go, but call Taylor
and we'll get a lunch on the books.

16:37.206 --> 16:38.749
Why did you hire me?

16:42.419 --> 16:46.757
I know we had a few glasses of wine,
but I'm pretty sure I told you.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.842
Your work was brilliant.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.679
That's what you tell all of us.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
I mean, it's like you snapped up anyone

16:54.681 --> 16:57.100
who's ever spilled a Red Bull
on a keyboard.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.520
We're expanding. We need talent.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.480
Talent. Really?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.982
I'm here with Duri,
the North Korea hacker,

17:03.982 --> 17:06.276
and Toby from Candy Crush.

17:06.276 --> 17:10.071
Are you too good for them?
Is this about your ego, Corah?

17:12.532 --> 17:13.867
No, this isn't my ego.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.619
This is about you telling me that
I could do great work here--

17:16.619 --> 17:19.830
bleeding edge, you know--
help people walk again, see again.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.835
And you expected that in your
first six months, did you?

17:22.835 --> 17:23.961
No, of course not.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.672
I didn't expect my code to disappear
down some rabbit hole

17:26.672 --> 17:30.968
at the Cybernetic Neuro-Interface unit,
which sounds cool as shit, by the way.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.470
I would like to work there.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.306
That's above your pay grade.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.058
Really? 'Cause you're paying me a lot.

17:39.184 --> 17:43.480
For which you signed a contract which
stipulates any and all output you produce

17:43.480 --> 17:47.276
while in our employ
is the exclusive property of AET.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.778
It's not your code, Corah.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.073
Are you serious?

17:56.118 --> 17:59.079
There's a seat for you
at the table if you want it,

17:59.580 --> 18:01.915
but that doesn't mean
you don't have to earn it.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.251
Everybody doesn't get a trophy here.

18:16.430 --> 18:17.973
It's 819. Try it again.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.266
Do you have her?

18:20.726 --> 18:22.394
Dr. Barnes, where are you?

18:22.394 --> 18:25.063
<i>I don't know.
I'm at a gas station somewhere.</i>

18:25.063 --> 18:27.065
- <i>I was at Outpost 87...</i>
- Eighty-eight.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.443
<i>...monitoring the gamma ray bursts
coming from Alaska,</i>

18:29.443 --> 18:32.070
<i>and then these people
came in and took over.</i>

18:32.070 --> 18:33.030
What people?

18:33.030 --> 18:35.032
<i>I don't know, but they had guns.</i>

18:35.032 --> 18:37.075
<i>The guy in charge said something about</i>

18:38.368 --> 18:41.079
<i>locking down the base
for operational security.</i>

18:41.079 --> 18:42.623
Outpost 88 is offline.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.751
Dr. Barnes, what was he doing there?
Why Outpost 88?

18:54.092 --> 18:55.344
Oh, yeah.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.722
So, Colonel, what do you want to take?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.683
Are you kidding?

19:04.353 --> 19:05.312
All of it.

19:06.063 --> 19:06.980
Thought so.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.275
You heard the Colonel.
Let's get these packed up.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.072
Hurry up. Let's go.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.083
Wait, slow down. Stop.
That's it. Stop, stop.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.381
Are you sure this is it?

19:33.006 --> 19:34.800
It matches what we pulled for last-known.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.595
I just can't imagine May living here.

19:39.263 --> 19:41.473
She didn't, but someone named Corah did.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.352
Yeah. Well, one way to find out.

19:51.984 --> 19:55.279
I don't know. I still think we should
just tell them the truth.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.907
What if Corah doesn't
want them to know the truth?

19:58.907 --> 20:00.993
That she's been hiding out,
using a fake name?

20:00.993 --> 20:03.495
Or what if she's protecting them
from something?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.414
We go barging in there
and spill the beans.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.416
No.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.751
We gotta play this cool.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.171
So, follow my lead, okay?

20:34.151 --> 20:35.569
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.032
Sorry, I don't have much to offer.

20:40.032 --> 20:42.034
No, this is awesome. Thank you.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.038
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.417
So, how do you guys know Corah again?

20:52.836 --> 20:56.673
From online mostly.
Then we connected in Japan.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.593
Corah was in Japan?

21:01.178 --> 21:02.429
Yes, briefly.

21:03.347 --> 21:06.517
Just passing through for work, I think.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.269
We're all in an online manga group.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.440
I see. Well, that sounds like fun.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.067
Oh, yeah.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.860
Did Corah tell you she'd be here?

21:17.694 --> 21:20.072
No-- Well, so the three of us were--

21:20.072 --> 21:22.699
were in town, and we thought
we'd take a chance, see if she was home.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.496
I didn't know she had so much family.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.832
Yeah, a sister and a brother.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.335
And Pawpaw and me, of course.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.840
So you saw Corah in Japan?

21:38.423 --> 21:39.675
Yeah, briefly.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.760
- So you all live there?
- No.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.721
I do. I'm from Tokyo.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.684
So, now you're here in Seattle,
looking for my sister.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.895
Yeah. We're going to this manga thing.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.065
What kind of manga is Corah into?

21:55.774 --> 21:57.901
Just your basic shojo stuff.

21:57.901 --> 22:02.155
I mean, obviously Naoko Takeuchi,
Moto-- Hagio.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.367
She's very, very big into Akira Toriyama.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.451
Toriyama.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.459
So, Corah doesn't live here now?

22:14.459 --> 22:16.795
Well, she had her own place.
But, you know--

22:17.462 --> 22:19.673
She travels so much now,
she doesn't really need it.

22:20.174 --> 22:23.385
Yeah. When was the last time she was home?

22:23.969 --> 22:24.970
Two years.

22:27.431 --> 22:28.682
Two years and a month.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.988
I still think we should tell them
what happened with May--

22:43.530 --> 22:44.573
Corah.

22:44.573 --> 22:46.450
We don't know what happened with Corah.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.161
Did you see her face? May's mom?

22:49.661 --> 22:50.996
Did you see the sister's face?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.332
She knows something, but she's not saying.

22:53.916 --> 22:54.833
How do you know?

22:56.627 --> 22:57.503
There she is.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.255
All right. Get in, get in.

23:21.944 --> 23:22.945
Left, left, left.

23:22.945 --> 23:24.571
- Kentaro, please.
- Go faster!

23:24.571 --> 23:27.407
- I know where to go.
- You have to go faster.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.159
- We're gonna lose her.
- She's right there.

23:29.159 --> 23:30.911
- She's right in front of us.
- Not too fast.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.204
It's just keep-- I'm just saying...

23:32.204 --> 23:34.456
- I can still see her.
- ...keep a safe distance.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.750
There's only one way in and out.
How did you lose her?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.585
I did not lose her, okay?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.504
We need to keep
an appropriate distance to avoid--

23:40.504 --> 23:42.506
- How did you lose her?
- Is that her car?

23:42.506 --> 23:44.925
- That's her car.
- Is she still in it?

23:44.925 --> 23:47.970
Slow-- Just hold-- Stop, stop.

23:48.887 --> 23:51.181
- Jesus! God.
- Get out! Get out of the car!

23:53.600 --> 23:56.520
Who the hell are you?
And don't give me that manga bullshit.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.272
I'm sorry we lied to you.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.941
- Are you with the company?
- What company?

24:00.941 --> 24:03.026
What do you want with my sister?

24:03.026 --> 24:04.111
Tell me the truth.

24:04.111 --> 24:05.654
We're her friends. That is the truth.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.656
We did meet your sister in Japan.

24:07.656 --> 24:10.492
She's been traveling with us,
helping us solve our own family mystery.

24:10.492 --> 24:14.621
Then good luck with that.
But you need to leave our family alone.

24:16.665 --> 24:20.669
She likes old tech, but thinks people
who collect vinyl are hopeless posers.

24:22.421 --> 24:25.924
Hell, she thinks
most people are stupid, like me.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.636
But it didn't stop her from helping me
when I needed her.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.932
That's a family trait.

24:35.684 --> 24:38.937
Look, we just wanna make sure
she's not in trouble.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.565
It's too late for that.

24:41.565 --> 24:42.900
What do you mean?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.110
Who is she in trouble with?

24:45.611 --> 24:46.695
Who's the company?

24:48.238 --> 24:52.576
Applied Experimental Technologies,
the company she worked for.

24:54.036 --> 24:55.454
It is cake time.

24:55.454 --> 24:56.538
Uh-uh. No, it's not.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.706
Not till we sing.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.584
- I know. It's pretty though, right?
- Yeah.

25:08.509 --> 25:12.971
No. No working. This is a birthday party.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.475
Hey. Hey.

25:16.475 --> 25:18.644
I've-- I'll be right back.

25:39.248 --> 25:42.751
- What's going on?
- I gotta go.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.170
Mom wondered if you were running to puke
because you were pregnant.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.840
I told her you're
working too hard to be getting any.

25:51.468 --> 25:52.678
Hey, what is it?

25:54.388 --> 25:55.347
Corah, tell me.

25:55.347 --> 25:59.768
I need you to get me some cash.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.229
And I need to take your passport.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.523
You can report it stolen next week, okay?

26:04.523 --> 26:06.859
What? Hey, come here.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.528
I have to go away, okay?

26:10.279 --> 26:12.614
I have to go away. I have to disappear.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.116
Wha--

26:15.367 --> 26:18.412
I love you so much.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.374
What did you do?

26:24.042 --> 26:25.919
When was the last time you heard from her?

26:25.919 --> 26:27.129
A couple of days ago.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.256
She called.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.341
She said she might be able to come back.

26:32.551 --> 26:34.303
She'd made some kind of deal.

26:42.603 --> 26:43.729
We're gonna find her.

26:45.564 --> 26:47.149
If you do find her,

26:48.150 --> 26:52.362
can you just let her know
that we don't care what happened?

26:54.072 --> 26:57.242
We just want her home, okay?

26:58.160 --> 26:59.161
We will.

27:10.839 --> 27:13.425
Corah. Prodigal coder.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.344
Brenda.

27:16.762 --> 27:17.763
Can I get you anything?

27:17.763 --> 27:21.391
Water, coffee, a good lawyer?

27:21.391 --> 27:24.853
If I needed one of those, I don't think
we'd be having this conversation.

27:24.853 --> 27:26.647
No, we wouldn't.

27:29.233 --> 27:31.902
So, what now?

27:33.362 --> 27:36.907
I offered you a tremendous opportunity.

27:37.741 --> 27:41.161
To be a part of something great,
something transformative.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.788
Yeah, I remember.

27:43.288 --> 27:46.083
It was part of your sales pitch
after the second bottle of wine.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.836
- I would have delivered on it.
- Bullshit.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.171
I saw what you were doing.

27:51.171 --> 27:54.508
And you thought that you,
the boss of your parents' entire basement,

27:54.508 --> 27:59.221
had the power, the ability,
the moral authority to put a stop to it.

29:34.858 --> 29:38.779
<i>What you saw down there
was the future being created.</i>

29:40.989 --> 29:44.493
And I knew it was you
the moment I saw that code.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.829
Might as well have signed your work.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.292
I think I wanted you to know
that it was me.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.378
Prideful.

29:55.629 --> 29:57.172
It's one of the reasons I recruited you.

29:57.923 --> 30:00.634
But you wiped out years of research.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.886
Millions of dollars of work.

30:02.886 --> 30:06.640
Oh, whatever. I'm sure Walter
has it in his couch cushions.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.311
You're such a disappointment.

30:16.275 --> 30:18.068
Why didn't you call the police?

30:18.068 --> 30:19.736
There wasn't a warrant.

30:21.071 --> 30:23.407
We prefer
to handle these things internally.

30:25.033 --> 30:28.245
We got her on CCTV
coming here about three hours ago.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.581
Monarch has CCTV access?

30:30.581 --> 30:31.748
I called in a favor.

30:34.543 --> 30:35.711
How do we get in?

30:36.420 --> 30:38.005
Are you gonna do
the bag-over-the-head thing,

30:38.005 --> 30:40.841
or does Monarch have
a secret rescue system?

30:43.260 --> 30:45.846
Wait. Do you have a rescue system?

30:48.974 --> 30:50.934
- Sort of.
- Another favor?

30:51.435 --> 30:52.644
Not exactly.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.784
I have a double cap for Joey.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.326
Tim.

31:50.410 --> 31:53.372
It's a relatively new program
that we've been working on since G-day.

31:53.956 --> 31:57.167
Japan has a similar system,
but we haven't actually gone public yet.

31:57.668 --> 31:59.044
Successful test.

32:11.932 --> 32:13.350
Do you need to get that?

32:14.393 --> 32:17.938
It appears the city may be in danger
of an imminent Titan attack.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.064
Okay, well--

32:19.982 --> 32:21.525
Shouldn't we go somewhere?

32:21.525 --> 32:23.610
What do you know about monsters, Corah?

32:24.194 --> 32:26.363
I know what everybody else knows.

32:26.363 --> 32:29.074
Yet somehow you found yourself
in the Sahara desert

32:29.074 --> 32:32.119
in the middle of what Monarch
refers to as an emergence event.

32:32.119 --> 32:34.538
Okay. Well, why does that matter to you?
You're a tech company.

32:34.538 --> 32:35.747
We're innovators.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.833
That's why I recruited you.

32:37.833 --> 32:41.837
Not to build on someone else's
tired ideas, but to see the future--

32:41.837 --> 32:44.339
What, and the future is monsters?
Look at this.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.758
You wanted to help
the paralyzed walk again.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.844
Imagine what we can learn
from a nervous system

32:48.844 --> 32:52.097
that allows something
as big as Godzilla to walk.

32:52.598 --> 32:55.434
That's what the Cybernetic Neuro-Interface
were up to.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.144
That's the work you destroyed.

32:57.144 --> 32:59.229
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

32:59.229 --> 33:00.397
Can we go now?

33:00.397 --> 33:01.982
- This is ridi--
- No need.

33:01.982 --> 33:05.277
If this were real,
we would have had advanced warning.

33:06.195 --> 33:11.325
Your friends are obviously using this
as a cover to rescue you.

33:11.325 --> 33:13.243
I'd love for them to succeed.

33:13.744 --> 33:19.249
You walk out of here, clean slate,
and even make sure you get your back pay.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.167
And?

33:20.167 --> 33:25.756
And you report back to me
everything you learn about these Titans.

33:28.550 --> 33:30.385
You want me to be your spy?

33:31.303 --> 33:33.180
Just keep doing what you've been doing:

33:33.847 --> 33:35.015
Living a lie.

33:35.516 --> 33:38.977
Or we can handle this officially,

33:39.603 --> 33:41.522
and you will need that lawyer.

33:45.776 --> 33:47.236
There she is.

33:49.488 --> 33:50.948
Welcome to AET.

33:53.909 --> 33:55.994
I'm so glad we got this settled.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.871
Thank you for coming in.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.001
What are you doing here?

34:03.001 --> 34:05.087
May. Hey.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.512
You can just leave?

34:14.638 --> 34:17.099
- Come on.
- No. Hey.

34:17.933 --> 34:19.601
I need to tell you something.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.148
I'm calling to say I love you.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.235
And I'm gonna call again
for Mom's birthday.

34:31.822 --> 34:32.906
Okay.

34:34.324 --> 34:35.324
Right.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.202
Bye.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.543
Did you just take my picture?

34:46.378 --> 34:47.254
No.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.300
I'm Kentaro.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.594
I'm May.

34:56.346 --> 34:57.347
May.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.559
My name's not May.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.729
My name is Corah Mateo,

35:03.729 --> 35:05.564
and I used to work here as a programmer

35:05.564 --> 35:08.150
until I did something
that I do not regret.

35:10.485 --> 35:14.656
It's why I ran away,
and it's why I lied to you.

35:14.656 --> 35:15.782
And you.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.661
When you came to me with your dad's files,

35:19.661 --> 35:23.498
I thought that I could use them
to get myself out of trouble. I--

35:24.416 --> 35:25.792
I didn't care about helping you.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.295
I didn't care about your dad.
I was using you.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.547
I was using you to save my own ass.

35:31.131 --> 35:34.927
And I don't want to be
that person anymore.

35:36.470 --> 35:39.681
And that's why I can't go with you
and I can't go home.

35:40.849 --> 35:41.850
I'm sorry.

35:42.559 --> 35:43.852
You have to go.

35:44.853 --> 35:46.271
We came all this way to get you.

35:46.271 --> 35:48.315
I know, but I didn't ask you to do that.

35:49.399 --> 35:50.484
I'm sorry for caring, May.

35:50.484 --> 35:53.737
- I really-- Seriously, you need to--
- May.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.739
- May.
- My name is not May.

35:57.074 --> 35:58.700
Are you listening to me?

36:00.160 --> 36:02.955
I need you to get the hell out of here.

36:04.831 --> 36:05.832
Let's go.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.928
What are they gonna do to her?

36:17.928 --> 36:19.930
Probably prosecute her
for the damage that she caused.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.723
Otherwise, make her work it off somehow.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.977
I feel like they wanted
something from her.

36:24.977 --> 36:26.895
- Wait.
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

36:26.895 --> 36:27.813
- Get in.
- Hey!

36:27.813 --> 36:30.023
Move his head. Get inside.

36:31.066 --> 36:33.527
- Let's roll.
- Move out.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.324
The Titan alert?

36:39.324 --> 36:40.826
- Really?
- I improvised.

36:40.826 --> 36:42.661
- I didn't think it was--
- No, you didn't think.

36:42.661 --> 36:44.705
We're in a crisis, and you're
yelling "fire" in a crowded theater.

36:44.705 --> 36:46.123
You said you didn't have any resources.

36:46.123 --> 36:48.083
You said you were gonna help
Randa's kids find their playmate.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.085
- Did you? Are we done playing <i>Goonies</i> now?
- Excuse me--

36:50.085 --> 36:53.213
Sort of. It turns out that
she's in a bit of trouble with AET.

36:54.965 --> 36:56.842
Right. Well, that's done.

36:56.842 --> 36:58.927
Now you have a job and an obligation,

36:58.927 --> 37:00.679
- and we have a plane to catch--
- No, we can't.

37:00.679 --> 37:04.183
Because it's possible we're all about to
be buried by whatever Shaw has planned.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.934
- Did you think about that?
- Hey!

37:08.604 --> 37:11.315
Miss Randa,
you're getting back on a plane.

37:11.315 --> 37:14.651
And this time, if you wander into the
red zone, you'll find yourself in jail.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.904
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

37:16.904 --> 37:20.574
No, you don't. So stop acting
like you know my business

37:20.574 --> 37:22.367
simply because your name is Randa.

37:22.367 --> 37:25.037
What I do know
is that you have a Shaw problem.

37:25.537 --> 37:28.415
You need to know where he's going
and what he's doing. Am I right?

37:30.042 --> 37:34.046
And you're proposing a solution
to this Shaw problem of mine?

37:34.546 --> 37:36.507
Okay, schoolteacher. Thrill me.

37:36.507 --> 37:38.050
I'll make you the same deal I made him.

37:39.009 --> 37:43.305
We found our dad's map, we found our dad,
and we found Godzilla.

37:44.306 --> 37:47.226
All on our own, without you or Monarch.

37:47.935 --> 37:51.605
You help us get May back,
and we'll help you find Shaw.

38:04.409 --> 38:06.119
Well, you made your choice.

38:10.874 --> 38:14.002
Man, I used to love telling people
I didn't care about money

38:15.003 --> 38:16.630
or the recognition.

38:17.798 --> 38:20.133
And the moment you dangled it
in front of me, I bit.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.971
I was pissed at you,
but I was pissed at myself.

38:24.847 --> 38:27.724
The night that I broke into the lab,
I couldn't handle that.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.227
So I screwed us both over.

38:31.812 --> 38:33.897
So this is the moral of your story then?

38:35.065 --> 38:38.068
From now on, I'm the only one
who'll pay for my mistakes.

38:38.652 --> 38:41.488
Yes. You are.

38:46.618 --> 38:47.744
Yeah?

38:47.744 --> 38:51.331
<i>There's a Natalia Verdugo
from Monarch here asking to see you.</i>

38:58.338 --> 38:59.339
There we go.

39:01.133 --> 39:02.634
Room for one more?

39:04.094 --> 39:05.095
Corah.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.221
Oh, my God.

39:08.432 --> 39:09.766
Hey!

39:12.978 --> 39:15.314
- Oh, my God!
- It's you!

39:27.117 --> 39:28.744
You happy with this agreement?

39:30.370 --> 39:31.747
What do you think?

39:36.502 --> 39:38.670
What is Monarch gonna say
about the Titan alert?

39:38.670 --> 39:39.922
PR will handle it.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.382
Meanwhile, we need to get to Washington

39:42.382 --> 39:45.469
and coordinate with the DOD
to get Shaw contained.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.180
I hope your little friends come through.

39:48.180 --> 39:53.685
I know that that is priority, but...

39:57.314 --> 40:01.485
I think that we should do--
that you should do this, the PR thing...

40:06.156 --> 40:08.617
The only way to do that...

40:11.954 --> 40:15.958
We have to bring Monarch
out of the shadows.

40:26.552 --> 40:27.594
Hey!

40:28.220 --> 40:29.221
Hey.

40:30.681 --> 40:31.765
What are you doing here?

40:32.766 --> 40:33.851
Where are we going?

40:35.310 --> 40:38.021
We are about to go help Monarch.

40:38.021 --> 40:43.026
Monarch made a deal for my freedom
with a corporation we shouldn't trust.

40:44.069 --> 40:46.697
We're not in the clear yet.
I'm going with you guys.

40:47.948 --> 40:48.949
Are you sure?

40:48.949 --> 40:50.117
You just got back.

40:50.117 --> 40:51.451
What about your family?

40:52.244 --> 40:53.912
Now I can call them anytime.

40:55.873 --> 40:57.249
Come on. I wanna go with y'all.

41:01.336 --> 41:02.337
Let's go.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.681
Wait...

41:14.933 --> 41:17.644
- Corah?
- No, you can call me May.

41:17.644 --> 41:20.189
- May.
- Please call me May.

41:20.772 --> 41:25.736
Okay, we're live in three, two, one.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.948
My name is Natalia Verdugo.

41:30.616 --> 41:35.037
I'm speaking to you today
as a representative of Monarch.

41:35.704 --> 41:42.002
Monarch is a global collaboration
of governmental and scientific agencies,

41:42.002 --> 41:43.462
<i>dedicated to the study of</i>

41:43.462 --> 41:48.342
<i>Massive Unidentified
Terrestrial Organisms, or M.U.T.O.s,</i>

41:48.342 --> 41:51.803
<i>including the creature we know
as Godzilla.</i>

41:52.304 --> 41:56.225
<i>Now, our mission is to protect you,
the citizens around the world.</i>

41:56.225 --> 41:58.310
<i>We bring the best minds</i>

41:58.310 --> 42:01.939
<i>and the most cutting-edge technology
to this purpose,</i>

42:01.939 --> 42:05.901
including the early-warning system
that was triggered in Seattle yesterday.

42:06.485 --> 42:08.862
And fortunately, this time
it was just a false alarm,

42:08.862 --> 42:11.949
and we regret any distress
this may have caused.

42:11.949 --> 42:15.577
But I take great comfort
in knowing robust systems

42:15.577 --> 42:19.790
are in place to give us ample warning
in a real emergency.

42:23.001 --> 42:24.211
Listen.

42:25.337 --> 42:28.465
I know that the events of G-day,
they rocked the world.

42:28.966 --> 42:32.845
A world where everything that we love,
everything that we hold dear--

42:32.845 --> 42:35.013
It just could be gone in an instant.

42:36.223 --> 42:38.684
Now, let me tell you as a mother,
I share your fear.

42:40.185 --> 42:42.229
<i>But this is now the world we live in.</i>

42:42.771 --> 42:45.190
<i>Monsters are an inescapable reality,</i>

42:46.108 --> 42:47.734
<i>a constant threat</i>

42:48.610 --> 42:52.406
<i>that we must learn to survive.</i>

42:53.866 --> 42:55.534
<i>And I believe we can.</i>

42:56.034 --> 42:59.705
Together, I believe we will.

43:00.831 --> 43:02.457
That is my commitment to you.

43:03.584 --> 43:06.879
And that is Monarch's commitment to you...

43:09.631 --> 43:10.632
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:14.136 --> 43:15.137
Yes, sir?

43:17.931 --> 43:18.974
Yes.

43:20.434 --> 43:25.063
I think if she sticks to our agreement,
it could be very fruitful.

43:28.859 --> 43:29.860
Oh, yes.

43:31.528 --> 43:32.905
It just arrived.

43:37.743 --> 43:39.411
I think it's perfect.

43:40.412 --> 43:43.207
A bold statement
for AET's new corporate mission.

43:45.834 --> 43:47.419
Good night, Mr. Simmons.

44:06.021 --> 44:07.689
Armaments are all set.

44:15.572 --> 44:17.199
Shaw here. Talk to me.

44:17.199 --> 44:19.618
<i>Colonel,
both teams are at the safety points.</i>

44:19.618 --> 44:21.370
- Are we clear?
- <i>Affirmative.</i>

44:21.370 --> 44:24.706
<i>- Inner circle, standing by.
- Copy. Outer circle, ready.</i>

44:26.333 --> 44:27.417
Copy. Clear.

44:30.754 --> 44:34.466
All right. Let's bring the roof down
on these things once and for all.

44:38.136 --> 44:39.096
Ready for you, sir.

44:40.430 --> 44:41.557
All right. Here we go.

44:44.184 --> 44:46.478
Inner circle, on my mark.

44:47.229 --> 44:50.524
Three, two, one, mark.

44:57.906 --> 44:59.867
It's clear.

44:59.867 --> 45:01.326
Sir, look!

45:02.995 --> 45:04.496
Outer circle, mark.

45:11.920 --> 45:14.089
Fall back. It's near the ground!

45:16.341 --> 45:17.759
Now, watch this.

45:25.267 --> 45:27.394
Get us out of here now.

45:55.464 --> 45:57.716
Yes!
