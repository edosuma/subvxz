Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:50.189 --> 00:53.927
Final load.
It's been a long day.

01:09.643 --> 01:14.816
Queen U! Queen U! Queen U!

01:22.855 --> 01:26.591
I've never seen
such an enthusiastic crowd.

01:27.828 --> 01:32.564
Oh, dear. She's been
touring for weeks.

01:32.566 --> 01:35.866
Queen Uberta,
your fans await.

01:35.868 --> 01:39.103
She too pooped to party.

01:39.105 --> 01:41.238
Upsy daisy now.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.942
No, downsy daisy. No!

01:43.944 --> 01:46.680
Quick, before I pass out!

01:49.016 --> 01:53.684
Queen U! Queen U! Queen U!

02:00.861 --> 02:03.127
Step aside
please, dear.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.595
Oh.

02:04.597 --> 02:08.733
You're such
beautiful little fans.

02:08.735 --> 02:10.768
- Thank you.
- Hi, Queen U.

02:10.770 --> 02:14.674
- And what is your name?
- My name's Ashley.

02:17.610 --> 02:20.780
- Next.
- Hi, Queen U.

02:22.149 --> 02:24.348
- What's your name?
- Melody.

02:24.350 --> 02:27.352
I had no idea
how popular this book was.

02:27.354 --> 02:30.054
Are you kidding?
I've read it five times.

02:30.056 --> 02:32.791
Count Antonio, that snake!

02:32.793 --> 02:35.994
He wanted all the gold
Queen U got for our dam,

02:35.996 --> 02:38.296
so he pretended to be
in love with her!

02:38.298 --> 02:42.601
But she saw through it
and brought him down!

02:42.603 --> 02:45.303
- Your name?
- Gwendolyn.

02:45.305 --> 02:47.905
"For Gwendolyn."

02:47.907 --> 02:49.840
My mom says
you made this book up

02:49.842 --> 02:52.977
and that you loved
Antonio for realsies.

02:52.979 --> 02:56.982
Your mother is...

03:01.955 --> 03:03.354
Next.

03:03.356 --> 03:06.791
Oh. Hello!

03:06.793 --> 03:11.966
Queen U! Queen U! Queen U!

03:14.033 --> 03:18.235
Remember, girls,
it's a queen's world!

03:18.237 --> 03:21.373
The kings just live in it.

03:23.676 --> 03:25.943
I was born to be a writer.

03:25.945 --> 03:30.815
Why did I waste so much time
on flower arrangements?

03:30.817 --> 03:34.989
Queen U! Queen U! Queen U!

03:35.989 --> 03:38.192
Time to boogie home.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.885
Come on!

04:17.997 --> 04:20.200
How's she doing?

04:22.168 --> 04:25.070
I love you.

04:25.072 --> 04:30.308
I was only pretending
to be in love with Antonio.

04:30.310 --> 04:34.148
In your dreams, woman.
In your dreams.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.199
- Mother!
- What's wrong?

05:29.201 --> 05:32.740
Never fear, Uberta!
I'll defend you from...

05:34.107 --> 05:36.106
Was it a moth again?

05:36.108 --> 05:41.378
I told you, Uberta, moths are
nothing more than pale butterflies.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.248
This is not
the work of a moth!

05:44.250 --> 05:47.084
More like a mountain lion!

05:48.521 --> 05:50.954
Or a dingo!

05:50.956 --> 05:54.526
A dingo scratched my baby!

05:54.528 --> 05:57.998
Oh, nonsense. I know exactly
what made these marks.

05:59.665 --> 06:04.135
It was bound to happen, the way you
clutch that book day and night.

06:04.137 --> 06:07.505
What have I done?

06:07.507 --> 06:09.841
No!

06:09.843 --> 06:11.075
Hmm. I don't know, Rogers.

06:11.077 --> 06:14.245
These scratches aren't really
consistent with mother's nails.

06:14.247 --> 06:17.048
And I didn't see any fibers
under her nails, either.

06:17.050 --> 06:20.819
Let's leave forensics to a
professional, shall we?

06:20.821 --> 06:24.355
No! Give her back to me!
You can't touch her!

06:24.357 --> 06:27.024
No! Out! Out! Out!

06:27.026 --> 06:28.293
Better cover.

06:32.232 --> 06:35.836
Well, at least her lungs
are in good shape.

06:39.839 --> 06:44.310
I can't believe I'm looking
for an animal that claws things.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.314
Hello.

06:48.548 --> 06:50.117
Raccoon?

06:51.218 --> 06:53.483
Uh... Too small.

06:53.485 --> 06:56.855
- Oh. Possum.
- Still too small.

06:58.190 --> 07:00.190
- Rats?
- Tell me,

07:00.192 --> 07:02.560
is this one of those times
when it's okay

07:02.562 --> 07:05.462
for a husband
to not tell the truth?

07:05.464 --> 07:08.265
Actually, it's required.

07:08.267 --> 07:11.536
Oh. Then these tracks
were made by friendly,

07:11.538 --> 07:13.538
fluffy little mice
who smell of cinnamon.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.207
- Nice try.
- I'm serious.

07:16.209 --> 07:19.213
They'd give you the shirt off
their back, if they had one.

07:19.913 --> 07:21.613
- I see.
- Feel better?

07:21.615 --> 07:23.817
Not in the least.

07:24.216 --> 07:26.219
Rats. Ugh.

08:03.956 --> 08:05.892
Lucas, come and see!

08:06.992 --> 08:08.028
Wow.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.627
I hope
King Sebastian likes it.

08:10.629 --> 08:13.096
Oh, he certainly does.

08:13.098 --> 08:17.000
Thank you for bringing your
talents to my kingdom.

08:17.002 --> 08:19.236
Oh. I'm going to get my easel

08:19.238 --> 08:23.342
and paint a selfie of me
and Jasper with these flowers.

08:25.644 --> 08:27.445
Flowers smowers.

08:27.447 --> 08:30.981
You couldn't get these things
to bloom later in the day, huh?

08:30.983 --> 08:33.984
- You're spoiled, Number 9.
- Spoiled?

08:33.986 --> 08:37.890
I prefer to think of myself
as very deserving.

08:38.091 --> 08:39.158
Boo!

08:41.293 --> 08:43.297
Oh, come on, nothing?

08:43.596 --> 08:45.032
Eh.

08:45.664 --> 08:48.132
Scully, you're back!

08:48.134 --> 08:50.033
We planted tulips
for King Sebastian.

08:50.035 --> 08:51.636
Which is the very reason
I came.

08:51.638 --> 08:55.138
- Might be a frost tonight, so...
- Got to get these covered then.

08:55.140 --> 08:58.008
Know where I can find some
giant sheets in this kingdom?

08:58.010 --> 09:01.214
Hmm. Unfortunately, I do.

09:23.035 --> 09:25.036
How many more
do you think we need?

09:25.038 --> 09:27.070
We've got a lot
of tulips to cover.

09:27.072 --> 09:29.306
Can we be done now?

09:29.308 --> 09:33.310
Oh. The scary expert is scared?
Boogie, boogie, boogie.

09:33.312 --> 09:37.047
Just 'cause I know scary
doesn't mean I like scary.

09:37.049 --> 09:39.017
I think this is the sheet
that was used

09:39.019 --> 09:41.319
to cover Antonio
and Nicollo's submarine.

09:41.321 --> 09:45.526
Psst! More over here! Let's
load them up and move them out!

09:46.225 --> 09:47.592
Wow.

09:47.594 --> 09:50.030
If I didn't know better...
Hold on.

09:52.331 --> 09:56.334
Yep. This must've been their
first try at a submarine.

09:56.336 --> 09:58.770
- Awesome.
- Should we see if it works?

10:01.441 --> 10:04.508
Looks like
you caught me again, Hunch.

10:04.510 --> 10:10.180
Oh. Except this time I used
the sidearm cast-and-snatch.

10:10.182 --> 10:13.584
Cinches tighter than your
basic overhand toss.

10:13.586 --> 10:16.621
Translation, don't expect
to be home for dinner.

10:16.623 --> 10:21.392
But here's the rub, my good Hunch,
I didn't do anything wrong.

10:21.394 --> 10:23.661
Oh, is that right? Hmm.

10:23.663 --> 10:25.363
Let me see then.

10:25.365 --> 10:29.599
"No one, be he alive or dead,"
so it reads...

10:29.601 --> 10:35.373
"shall steal pink bellies
from the Boggs, Bogg Island,

10:35.375 --> 10:38.608
"or any of its wholly owned
subsidiaries."

10:38.610 --> 10:41.079
"Rescue" is a better word,
I think.

10:41.081 --> 10:45.550
Well, look who's been
to Fancy Word Camp!

10:45.552 --> 10:47.251
You stole.

10:47.253 --> 10:52.290
A clear violation of Bogg Code
section 3, article 19.

10:52.292 --> 10:55.459
Oh. The Boggs have codes now.
Very nice.

10:55.461 --> 10:59.129
It's great, right?
I kept telling Nums,

10:59.131 --> 11:01.565
"The Boggs need law and order.

11:01.567 --> 11:05.402
"And I'm gonna give it to
them, or I'll die trying!"

11:05.404 --> 11:09.272
And then I died.
But I'm still trying.

11:09.274 --> 11:13.111
Nice! Is it just me, or have you
gotten better with that rope?

11:13.113 --> 11:16.180
- Nobody gets away from Larry.
- Larry?

11:16.182 --> 11:19.650
That's what I call my lariat!
Larry the lariat.

11:19.652 --> 11:21.252
It's catchy, right?

11:22.522 --> 11:23.887
That's clever!

11:23.889 --> 11:28.225
Remember that time I let you flatter
me, and you worked yourself free?

11:30.496 --> 11:33.430
Here we go again.

11:34.701 --> 11:37.104
I always forget about glass.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.339
Scully?

11:47.346 --> 11:48.548
Whoa!

11:51.618 --> 11:52.849
Hey, that hurt!

11:52.851 --> 11:55.088
No, no, no!

11:56.688 --> 11:57.690
No, you don't.

12:04.697 --> 12:08.668
- Where'd Scully go?
- Hopefully, practicing his "boo."

12:12.371 --> 12:13.406
Alise!

12:13.773 --> 12:15.540
Alise! Lucas!

12:15.542 --> 12:18.278
Beware the man in black!

12:20.480 --> 12:22.512
What's taking so long?

12:22.514 --> 12:25.650
For heaven's sake, Jean-Bob,
it's not rocket science.

12:25.652 --> 12:27.384
I need that measurement!

12:28.587 --> 12:32.290
If you tried to jam yourself
into a shoe box,

12:32.292 --> 12:34.261
then you'll understand!

12:37.897 --> 12:40.897
To get in there,
I'd have to be a tadpole.

12:40.899 --> 12:42.401
I quit.

12:42.802 --> 12:44.138
Quit?

12:44.803 --> 12:47.271
Jean-Bob, this invention,

12:47.273 --> 12:50.807
once used for stealing gold
and kidnapping kings,

12:50.809 --> 12:53.578
can finally
be put to good use.

12:53.580 --> 12:58.248
But I cannot recreate its
blueprint without your help.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.618
Just take it apart
and measure it.

13:02.754 --> 13:06.891
I would sooner die than deconstruct
such a work of genius!

13:06.893 --> 13:10.828
Please, Jean-Bob. You're the
only one who can do this!

13:10.830 --> 13:14.665
I must figure out how they
made this thing work.

13:14.667 --> 13:18.736
Take pity on an old man
of science, won't you?

13:22.241 --> 13:24.307
- Oh, all right.
- Great!

13:24.309 --> 13:25.943
Now get yourself
down in there!

13:43.830 --> 13:46.600
1.77.

13:46.966 --> 13:49.800
1.77.

13:49.802 --> 13:53.307
1.77.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.874
Something's
scratching my back!

13:57.876 --> 13:59.877
You have to stay
down there, Jean-Bob.

13:59.879 --> 14:02.546
Don't come out yet. Okay?

14:02.548 --> 14:04.815
This is why they have
unions, you know.

14:04.817 --> 14:07.618
Try to relax, little buddy.

14:07.620 --> 14:11.792
Relax? You try getting your head,
arms, and legs inside a...

14:12.625 --> 14:14.324
Show-off.

14:14.326 --> 14:16.826
I've got it!
I know how it works.

14:16.828 --> 14:19.997
They pressurized
a discombobulator

14:19.999 --> 14:24.502
and nincomfited the cogmaster
to a wheelheimer!

14:24.504 --> 14:26.570
Exactly
what I was going to say.

14:26.572 --> 14:29.773
Now I can build
an even better submarine

14:29.775 --> 14:33.246
by simply following
this blue...

14:37.517 --> 14:38.549
Huh?

14:43.789 --> 14:45.656
Ah! How did... Who...

14:45.658 --> 14:46.759
A-ha!

14:47.793 --> 14:49.795
There's rats in here!

14:52.365 --> 14:54.634
There's rats down there, too!

14:56.034 --> 14:58.669
It's really strange.

14:58.671 --> 15:00.574
Why would rats do this?

15:03.676 --> 15:05.910
Ooh. Interesting.

15:05.912 --> 15:08.378
Outer space is interesting.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.485
This is a catastrophe!

15:19.524 --> 15:22.126
I must be walking in my sleep!

15:22.128 --> 15:23.828
I... I'm a...

15:23.830 --> 15:25.799
I'm a monster!

15:27.133 --> 15:28.666
Do what you must!

15:28.668 --> 15:31.801
Clip them as short
as a washerwoman's!

15:33.840 --> 15:35.539
Do it!

15:35.541 --> 15:38.675
But do give them
a nice touch of color.

15:38.677 --> 15:41.112
Perhaps something
in the mauve family.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.414
No, Uberta, I was wrong.

15:43.416 --> 15:46.717
It wasn't you who scratched the book.
Not at all.

15:46.719 --> 15:50.121
So you let me carry on

15:50.123 --> 15:55.859
and embarrass myself
for no reason?

15:55.861 --> 15:57.828
No, Mother, please!

16:04.803 --> 16:06.436
Now, let's all calm down.

16:06.438 --> 16:08.439
How? We've got rats!

16:08.441 --> 16:12.008
Rats on an evil mission
from who-knows-whom.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.712
All of us marked.

16:14.714 --> 16:16.479
On a hit list.

16:16.481 --> 16:18.882
But what does
the "Z" stand for?

16:18.884 --> 16:22.453
That's easy. "Zhe bad guy!"

16:22.455 --> 16:24.854
Let's not jump to conclusions.

16:24.856 --> 16:29.362
These could be the marks of
friendly cinnamon-scented mice.

16:31.197 --> 16:34.831
I'm just saying,
we need to be calm.

16:34.833 --> 16:38.802
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You're not on a hit list!

16:40.773 --> 16:41.841
Huh?

17:06.665 --> 17:08.031
Oh. No.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.801
I'll just be moving along.

17:11.804 --> 17:15.472
If we're all marked,
Alise and Lucas!

17:15.473 --> 17:17.173
We'll leave right away
for Borromeo.

17:17.175 --> 17:20.076
Puffin, you fly ahead.
Warn the children.

17:31.523 --> 17:34.892
Thief!
You stole our pink bellies!

17:34.894 --> 17:36.727
We'll get revenge!

17:36.729 --> 17:40.834
- How did you catch him?
- Sidearm cast-and-snatch.

17:41.834 --> 17:44.034
It's a new
roping classic, buddo.

17:44.036 --> 17:48.674
Yep! Say toodle-loo to the
overhand toss because...

17:49.709 --> 17:52.276
I'll catch you up
on the details later.

17:52.278 --> 17:55.246
You shouldn't have done
what you've done, ghost.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.648
Those were our pink bellies.

17:57.650 --> 17:59.583
But basically
it cinches tighter.

17:59.585 --> 18:02.456
That's all I'm gonna say for now.
Details to follow.

18:08.794 --> 18:10.026
Oh...

18:14.834 --> 18:18.835
Article 3,
section 19, point 1,

18:18.837 --> 18:24.240
sub-clause A, addendum C,
particle M, slash umlaut.

18:24.242 --> 18:27.878
"The penalty
for stealing pink bellies,

18:27.880 --> 18:32.650
"if the guilty party
be a ghost, shall be..."

18:32.652 --> 18:33.720
Huh...

18:36.154 --> 18:37.656
Ah!

18:40.593 --> 18:43.026
Life behind glass.

18:43.028 --> 18:44.698
Yeah.

18:46.265 --> 18:47.767
Get in.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.936
I can't possibly fit in there.

18:56.909 --> 18:58.111
Oh! Yeah!

19:00.278 --> 19:01.815
Yep.

19:04.282 --> 19:06.519
In you go.

19:08.653 --> 19:10.957
So no trial, huh?

19:13.759 --> 19:16.893
Wait! Point of order, Nums.

19:16.895 --> 19:20.197
It's a small thing
and yet a big thing.

19:20.199 --> 19:22.900
Tiny yet gargantuan.

19:22.902 --> 19:26.303
Miniscupule yet
elephantinormous.

19:26.305 --> 19:28.305
- Lillipushkin yet...
- What?

19:28.307 --> 19:31.107
You can't punish him
without a trial first!

19:31.109 --> 19:36.145
If someone finds out we put him
in that jar without a trial,

19:36.147 --> 19:39.816
they could technically,

19:39.818 --> 19:41.218
feasibly,

19:41.220 --> 19:43.088
set him free.

19:53.898 --> 19:55.032
Wait, wait.

19:55.034 --> 19:58.235
I got him here.
I'll get him in that jar

19:58.237 --> 20:00.073
fair and square.

20:06.045 --> 20:10.680
Game on! I've been
training all my life for this!

20:10.682 --> 20:13.784
Well, all my
ghost life, anyway.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.318
But that's still a life.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.788
Here we go again.

20:18.790 --> 20:21.357
On the upside,
I'm getting a trial.

20:21.359 --> 20:25.164
On the downside, I'm being tried
by some pretty dumb animals.

20:29.234 --> 20:30.903
Beautiful.

20:32.003 --> 20:34.371
Beautiful.

20:34.373 --> 20:37.711
A bouquet for every home
in Borromeo.

20:59.397 --> 21:01.265
This is my favorite color.

21:01.267 --> 21:03.970
Ah, here they are.

21:07.906 --> 21:10.140
Puffin, it's so boring.

21:10.142 --> 21:13.776
And if anything needs
protecting, it's the tulips.

21:13.778 --> 21:16.145
I'm sorry, children, but
no one leaves the castle

21:16.147 --> 21:18.315
until Derek and Odette say so.

21:18.317 --> 21:20.053
Thank you, Puffin.

21:22.188 --> 21:24.321
Mama! Papa!

21:24.323 --> 21:26.926
Sweetheart, you're safe.

21:28.894 --> 21:31.894
You saw what's
been done to my tulips.

21:31.896 --> 21:33.930
Someone's leaving a mark.

21:33.932 --> 21:37.804
- Do you have any idea what it means?
- I wish I did.

21:44.777 --> 21:48.045
A statue
of Nicollo and Antonio.

21:48.047 --> 21:52.048
It's slated for destruction,
but, until then,

21:52.050 --> 21:55.219
I must attend
to more pressing matters.

21:58.457 --> 22:00.093
King Sebastian!

22:20.813 --> 22:22.546
Not to worry, Jasper.

22:22.548 --> 22:25.250
We'll have it repaired
in no time.

22:32.423 --> 22:34.126
Order in the court!

22:35.528 --> 22:38.230
Hmm. That's a quality tool.

22:38.497 --> 22:40.096
Proceed.

22:40.098 --> 22:43.834
Do you promise not to tell
a bunch of big fat lies?

22:43.836 --> 22:45.739
I certainly do.

22:46.505 --> 22:51.107
My dear, diablical Mr. Scully,

22:51.109 --> 22:54.545
not your first time
to Bogg Island?

22:54.547 --> 22:57.413
- No, sir.
- The accused agrees.

22:59.384 --> 23:01.153
Let it be so noted.

23:03.521 --> 23:04.890
Hmm?

23:06.157 --> 23:08.025
Uh... Never mind.

23:08.027 --> 23:13.197
On your previous visit,
did you come as a ghost?

23:13.199 --> 23:19.268
Objection! Your Honor, these questions
about ghosts are immaterial.

23:19.270 --> 23:21.537
Get it?

23:24.009 --> 23:27.177
Sustained,
because it's funny.

23:27.179 --> 23:29.278
- Seriously?
- Proceed.

23:29.280 --> 23:34.017
- The porpoise?
- I'm sorry. Are we talking about dolphins?

23:34.019 --> 23:37.321
No! The porpoise
of your visit to Bogg Island.

23:37.323 --> 23:38.921
I came to see my friends.

23:38.923 --> 23:43.459
Your pink belly friends,
am I right?

23:43.461 --> 23:45.027
Exactamundo.

23:45.029 --> 23:47.163
And these pink belly friends,

23:47.165 --> 23:52.236
are they the same pink bellies
my client was planning to eat?

23:52.238 --> 23:53.469
The very same.

23:53.471 --> 23:56.472
And then suddenly
they were set free.

23:56.474 --> 23:58.408
Imagine that!

23:58.410 --> 24:00.611
No further questions.

24:00.613 --> 24:04.046
Never even took a class.

24:04.048 --> 24:09.620
Mr. Scully. First, I wanna thank
you for being so transparent.

24:12.590 --> 24:14.860
I'm killing me.

24:16.929 --> 24:21.632
From now on, Mr. Scully
wants to represent himself.

24:21.634 --> 24:25.434
So I wanted to make it fun.
Sue me.

24:25.436 --> 24:29.405
Your Honor, I would like
to call a witness. Nums.

24:37.615 --> 24:39.982
Will you state your name
for the record, sir?

24:39.984 --> 24:43.519
- Nums.
- And that is your full name?

24:48.493 --> 24:51.128
Is Nums your full name,
sir, or no?

24:51.130 --> 24:54.664
Objection, Your Honor!
He's badgering the witness!

24:54.666 --> 24:57.968
Badgering? Excuse me, Your Honor.
Nothing of the sort.

24:57.970 --> 24:59.937
Badgers are fierce animals!

24:59.939 --> 25:03.640
My question is friendly,
like a bunny rabbit.

25:03.642 --> 25:08.010
Well, it's okay
to bunny rabbit the witness.

25:08.012 --> 25:09.214
Huh?

25:10.548 --> 25:13.417
Your full name then, sir.

25:13.419 --> 25:15.719
Um. Numsy...

25:15.721 --> 25:18.255
Yes, and?

25:18.257 --> 25:21.591
Wumsy, okay? Wumsy!
It's Numsy Wumsy!

25:26.097 --> 25:29.533
Very well then, Mr...

25:29.535 --> 25:32.436
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

25:32.438 --> 25:35.205
Mr...

25:36.275 --> 25:39.508
I'm sorry.
All right, moving on.

25:39.510 --> 25:43.145
What proof do you have that
I stole your pink bellies?

25:43.147 --> 25:44.213
Objection!

25:44.215 --> 25:48.352
That was not
a bunny rabbit question.

25:48.354 --> 25:50.019
He may not be badgering,

25:50.021 --> 25:52.756
but he's at least
weaseling my client.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.025
And weasels
can be fierce, too!

25:55.027 --> 25:58.461
- No weaseling the witness.
- Fair enough.

25:58.463 --> 25:59.763
Sir, you seem an honest Bogg.

25:59.765 --> 26:02.065
I'm sure you wouldn't
accuse me of stealing

26:02.067 --> 26:05.035
- if you didn't see it yourself, right?
- Yes.

26:05.037 --> 26:06.402
So how did I do it?

26:06.404 --> 26:08.270
When we weren't looking,

26:08.272 --> 26:11.641
you untied their ropes
and hauled them off.

26:11.643 --> 26:14.244
You saw me
do that, did you?

26:14.246 --> 26:17.546
Yes, I did,
you thieving ghost!

26:20.752 --> 26:23.186
Order. Order.

26:23.188 --> 26:24.421
Um...

26:24.423 --> 26:28.025
One final question before I turn
myself over to your justice.

26:28.027 --> 26:32.496
Sir, would you be so kind as to take
up the gavel and throw it at me?

26:32.498 --> 26:35.632
Throw it right at me. Just right
here in the old bread basket.

26:35.634 --> 26:37.971
Here, "X" marks the spot.
Right here.

26:40.239 --> 26:44.641
- Objection?
- What could you possibly object to?

26:44.643 --> 26:47.510
Unless he throws
less like a Nums

26:47.512 --> 26:49.645
and more like a Numsy Wumsy?

26:54.086 --> 26:57.086
How does a ghost who can't
touch or be touched

26:57.088 --> 27:00.326
untie ropes
and haul off pink bellies?

27:00.792 --> 27:04.094
Did not see that coming.

27:04.096 --> 27:07.631
Your Honor, I move
that you declare a mistrial!

27:07.633 --> 27:10.167
Say he's guilty! Say it!

27:10.169 --> 27:12.768
But we haven't deliberated.

27:12.770 --> 27:15.372
- Guilty!
- It doesn't count!

27:15.374 --> 27:20.012
Only a foreman can say
"guilty," and I'm the foreman.

27:21.547 --> 27:23.613
Order in the court!

27:23.615 --> 27:26.115
Bailiff, establish order!

27:26.117 --> 27:28.818
I've been waiting
all day for that.

27:30.556 --> 27:32.823
Come on! Get out of here!

27:34.259 --> 27:38.094
This is not proper
courtroom decorum.

28:00.519 --> 28:01.621
Oh. That can't be good.

28:05.457 --> 28:07.157
- Princess!
- Scully!

28:07.159 --> 28:10.427
There's a... We got a...
I think there's a...

28:19.471 --> 28:21.304
Derek! Move!

28:23.174 --> 28:26.343
- Good thing I'm a ghost.
- That was close.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.847
Derek, he controls the rats.
He was spying on you.

28:31.849 --> 28:33.482
- Then he whistled!
- Who?

28:33.484 --> 28:36.221
A man in black.
I've seen him before.

28:37.455 --> 28:39.125
Follow him, Scully.

29:06.884 --> 29:08.653
He jumped.

29:18.896 --> 29:20.796
I'm an innocent ghost!

29:20.798 --> 29:22.632
You're a foo-gitive.

29:22.634 --> 29:26.572
But Larry and I are
gonna fix that.

29:35.614 --> 29:38.381
<i>My men
are searching everywhere.</i>

29:38.383 --> 29:40.683
So far, no man in black.

29:40.685 --> 29:43.987
I'm worried that he'll try
to hurt the children.

29:43.989 --> 29:46.690
Don't worry.
Scully will find him.

29:46.692 --> 29:48.557
Your Majesty.

29:48.559 --> 29:52.164
The prisoner Nicollo requests
to speak with Prince Derek.

29:52.396 --> 29:53.662
Alone.

29:53.664 --> 29:57.700
He says he has information
about the man in black.

29:57.702 --> 29:58.901
I'll be back.

29:58.903 --> 30:02.305
Prince Derek.
Don't get your hopes up.

30:02.307 --> 30:05.678
Nicollo's mind
is quite undone.

30:13.951 --> 30:15.619
Well?

30:15.621 --> 30:18.654
No sign of the man in black
or Scully, I'm afraid.

30:18.656 --> 30:20.757
- You?
- Just more rats.

30:20.759 --> 30:24.661
Follow the rats! That's how
we can find the man in black.

30:24.663 --> 30:28.297
I don't like it, Princess.
Let's leave that to Scully.

30:28.299 --> 30:30.432
Well, when he
shows up, I will.

30:30.434 --> 30:33.603
Until then,
I'm following the rats.

30:33.605 --> 30:34.837
Ugh!

30:34.839 --> 30:37.442
I can't believe
I just said that.

30:38.042 --> 30:40.009
I'm gonna need help, Number 9.

30:40.011 --> 30:43.345
Uh-huh. No way!
Talk to the paw, people.

30:43.347 --> 30:46.783
- Number 9!
- Look, even if I wanted to,

30:46.785 --> 30:48.554
the King would never allow it.

30:53.325 --> 30:55.758
What are you gonna do?
I'm popular.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.694
I've got it!
Follow the rats!

30:58.696 --> 31:00.363
Your Highness?

31:00.365 --> 31:02.332
And here's how you do it!

31:02.334 --> 31:04.633
- Jasper!
- Are you sure?

31:04.635 --> 31:05.869
I thought maybe...

31:05.871 --> 31:08.671
Uh-uh. Jasper and I
may be royalty,

31:08.673 --> 31:12.508
but when it comes to friends,
we are foot soldiers.

31:12.510 --> 31:16.645
- Aren't we, Jasper?
- Only if you insist.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.516
Help me.

31:20.051 --> 31:21.985
- Scully?
- I can't find the man in black

31:21.987 --> 31:23.452
with this fellow chasing me.

31:23.454 --> 31:26.389
What fellow?
I don't see a fellow!

31:26.391 --> 31:28.658
- Is there a fellow?
- It's a Bogg ghost.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.660
Get Rogers.
He'll know what to do.

31:30.662 --> 31:32.895
Oh. And tell him to bring
the thing I gave him.

31:32.897 --> 31:35.333
I'll fly back
and let him know.

31:41.539 --> 31:44.542
Hey, that buffed out
very nicely.

31:45.042 --> 31:46.575
Red alert!

31:46.577 --> 31:48.844
We need help tracking a ghost!

31:48.846 --> 31:50.947
Yes!

31:50.949 --> 31:52.548
This pleases you?

31:52.550 --> 31:55.552
It makes me insane with joy!

31:55.554 --> 31:58.787
Oh, and Scully said to remember
to bring the thing he gave you.

31:58.789 --> 32:01.056
Right!

32:01.058 --> 32:03.426
Now, where is it?
It's in here somewhere.

32:03.428 --> 32:06.395
I put it behind the...
No, it's not.

32:06.397 --> 32:08.832
It's not. I forgot about that.

32:08.834 --> 32:10.467
What don't you have in there?

32:10.469 --> 32:13.072
Probably not a statue
of a monkey.

32:13.571 --> 32:14.703
Oh!

32:14.705 --> 32:16.574
Toy dentures.

32:18.977 --> 32:22.581
A beautiful maiden
to give me a kiss.

32:25.584 --> 32:26.786
Figures.

32:27.853 --> 32:30.018
Paralyzing spray?

32:30.020 --> 32:32.588
I call it "deodorant."

32:32.590 --> 32:35.694
A fresh spy is a good spy.

32:36.494 --> 32:37.960
Ah.

32:37.962 --> 32:39.796
My ghost rope.

32:39.798 --> 32:43.165
No beautiful maiden,
but he's got a ghost rope!

32:43.167 --> 32:47.003
Finally, our first venture
into the paranormal world.

32:47.005 --> 32:48.604
Come on!

32:48.606 --> 32:51.975
Um. I'll just stay here
in the normal world.

32:51.977 --> 32:54.443
Which includes rats.

32:54.445 --> 32:57.615
Paranormal world, here I come!

33:08.160 --> 33:11.960
Sure, let the frog drive!

33:11.962 --> 33:15.532
I've made a few improvements
to our communication system.

33:15.534 --> 33:16.833
Nice.

33:16.835 --> 33:19.872
Young Tree Climber
awaits our first message.

33:29.847 --> 33:31.048
You asked to see me?

33:32.851 --> 33:36.585
You asked the man
to come here? Say something!

33:36.587 --> 33:38.587
I did no such thing!

33:43.795 --> 33:45.694
Who is he?

33:45.696 --> 33:49.199
It's Prince Derek, fool!
His mother wrote the book.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.533
Oh.

33:50.535 --> 33:53.538
<i>Queen U to the Rescue.</i>

33:57.976 --> 34:03.983
You're the one who out-dueled
Antonio and ruined all our plans.

34:09.820 --> 34:12.188
Back off! Get back!

34:12.190 --> 34:15.925
Not only him.
There's the Queen, Lord Rogers,

34:15.927 --> 34:21.097
that bird, the frog, the turtle,
Alise, Lucas! Not just him.

34:21.099 --> 34:24.536
Excuse me. I, for one,
bow to you.

34:25.536 --> 34:27.835
As do I.

34:27.838 --> 34:30.840
Stop bowing lower than me.

34:30.842 --> 34:32.445
You stop it.

34:45.856 --> 34:50.693
I was told you had some information
about the man in black.

34:50.695 --> 34:52.527
Well, tell him.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.030
You tell him.

34:54.032 --> 34:56.164
You are the
one who asked him here.

34:56.166 --> 34:59.471
I did
no such thing! Who is he?

35:00.105 --> 35:01.804
I think we're done here.

35:01.806 --> 35:06.141
- Psst! Antonio's back.
- Antonio is back?

35:06.143 --> 35:07.846
I just said that.

35:10.614 --> 35:14.684
You think Antonio survived
a hurricane in a rowboat?

35:14.686 --> 35:18.720
Oh, he could survive anything
with my inventions,

35:18.722 --> 35:21.758
including a leap
from a tall building.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.260
Just like he
survived leaping from the dam

35:25.262 --> 35:28.164
in order to destroy it.

35:28.166 --> 35:31.934
Oh! Yes, we were
the brains, you see?

35:31.936 --> 35:35.637
Antonio?
He was just a pretty face.

35:35.639 --> 35:38.009
Hey! What about mine?

35:38.909 --> 35:40.846
No. Not possible.

35:42.280 --> 35:46.018
Please, my friend,
let us help you capture him.

35:47.885 --> 35:50.619
He's free because of us.

35:50.621 --> 35:54.025
But he let us rot
in this prison!

35:54.592 --> 35:55.925
We can find him.

35:55.927 --> 35:57.927
We know how he thinks!

35:57.929 --> 36:01.764
He'll get you
all if you don't listen to what we say.

36:01.766 --> 36:04.300
Why were you marked, Derek?

36:04.302 --> 36:07.202
Think about it.
It's all in the name.

36:07.204 --> 36:09.007
It's all in the name!

36:11.175 --> 36:12.978
He's back.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.615
Blew it again, didn't you?

36:19.617 --> 36:24.220
What? It's
all your looney talk that sunk us.

36:24.222 --> 36:25.822

Yes!

"Hello, Skinny Professor.
Scully here with me."

38:19.737 --> 38:24.307
- Excellent!
- "Excellent."

38:24.309 --> 38:28.211
"I have ankle bracelets."

38:28.213 --> 38:32.081
No one cares about your jewelry.
Get to the point.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.382
Do you mind?

38:33.384 --> 38:36.351

39:00.210 --> 39:03.512
Can't put bracelet on a ghost.

39:13.257 --> 39:16.092
Shut my mouth.

- Wonderful.

Scared out of my wits!

40:01.606 --> 40:03.972

40:03.974 --> 40:06.909

It won't do much good

Oh, no.

45:43.547 --> 45:48.184

anything about the sea?

46:13.710 --> 46:16.945
Antonio rowed into Hurricane Sally,

46:16.947 --> 46:19.380
which took ships
the size of that one,

46:19.382 --> 46:23.519
begging your pardon, Highness, and
dashed them into matchsticks!

46:23.521 --> 46:26.222
Right. Probably
a crazy question.

46:26.224 --> 46:30.458
- Indeed it is, if you'll beg my...
- Pardon granted.

46:30.460 --> 46:31.562

47:07.998 --> 47:10.398
Antonio is the man in black.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.666
- He's back.
- No.

47:11.668 --> 47:15.003
Can you afford more guards to
protect Odette and the children?

47:15.005 --> 47:16.537
- Oh, dear.
- What?

47:16.539 --> 47:20.008
Odette is following the rats

49:20.898 --> 49:24.400
While Scully searches this
quarter, you search here.

49:24.402 --> 49:26.702
We've got to find
the man in black!

49:26.704 --> 49:29.871
I'm on it.
What's he look like?

49:29.873 --> 49:31.642
He's a man

49:32.675 --> 49:34.809
in black.

49:34.811 --> 49:36.144
Well, it makes sense.

49:39.016 --> 49:41.452
Come on, keep up, Number 9.

49:51.061 --> 49:53.528
Well, okay, it's been fun.

49:53.530 --> 49:55.664
Got to leave.
Got to get a caticure.

49:55.666 --> 49:59.034
Oh, no. We're seeing
this through together.

49:59.036 --> 50:01.637
No way. I'm not going
on their turf.

50:01.639 --> 50:07.141
Okay. But go tell the King
I went underground alone.

50:07.143 --> 50:10.112
By myself. With the rats.

50:10.114 --> 50:12.780
Just me. Without you.

50:14.117 --> 50:18.389
Okay, okay. Rats. I'm coming.

50:32.068 --> 50:34.503
"How did you die, Number 9?"

50:34.505 --> 50:39.541
"I followed rats into a sewer, yeah,
'cause I was trying to find a lunatic!"

50:39.543 --> 50:42.811
"Doesn't sound too smart."
"Tell me about it."

50:42.813 --> 50:45.717
I think
we're getting close.

50:46.217 --> 50:48.519
This cat can't wait.

51:04.168 --> 51:06.503
They went this way. Come on.

51:10.206 --> 51:12.443
Not crazy about that.

51:15.278 --> 51:17.612
Someone's trying to trap us.

51:17.614 --> 51:19.850
You think? I'm out of here.

51:24.255 --> 51:26.088
<i>I've got eyes
on the man in black.</i>

51:26.090 --> 51:29.090
- What's he doing?
- <i>Am I clear to investigate?</i>

51:29.092 --> 51:30.627
Clear to investigate.

51:40.603 --> 51:42.570
- Wait!
- What?

51:42.572 --> 51:43.771
Something's not right.

51:43.773 --> 51:46.108
I don't think the trap
was for us.

51:46.110 --> 51:47.545
But who then?

51:48.144 --> 51:49.880
Derek! Move!

51:50.313 --> 51:52.179
Odette!

51:52.181 --> 51:53.684
Derek!

52:03.059 --> 52:04.628
Derek!

52:07.130 --> 52:08.899
Derek!

52:11.936 --> 52:15.637
- Princess.
- Stop him. He's gonna trap Derek.

52:15.639 --> 52:19.307
- <i>He's going to trap Derek.</i>
- Where, Friendly Ghost? Where?

52:19.309 --> 52:21.913
<i>Somewhere in section three.
Send help.</i>

52:24.047 --> 52:25.914
<i>Do you copy?</i>

52:25.916 --> 52:28.883
I copy.

52:28.885 --> 52:30.521
Skinny Professor?

52:39.963 --> 52:44.668
Prince Derek in trouble!
Section three! Bring help!

52:47.237 --> 52:48.940
Odette!

52:52.242 --> 52:53.745
Odette!

52:55.846 --> 52:57.014
No.

52:58.315 --> 52:59.751
Where's Odette?

53:01.085 --> 53:02.818
If you've harmed her,
Antonio...

53:02.820 --> 53:05.052
- Where's Prince Derek?
- I'm down here.

53:05.054 --> 53:06.590
Get these grates open.

53:07.157 --> 53:08.960
He's getting away!

53:09.960 --> 53:11.695
Derek!

53:13.630 --> 53:15.731
- Odette.
- He wants you, Derek.

53:15.733 --> 53:18.367
It's always been about you.

53:18.369 --> 53:20.369
We need to go back to Nicollo.

53:20.371 --> 53:23.708
Exactly. He's our
best lead to Antonio.

53:25.074 --> 53:26.974
Your Royal Highness, here.

53:37.387 --> 53:39.854
We might've lost the man
in black for the moment,

53:39.856 --> 53:41.625
but we can find him again.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.195
You didn't have a chance!

53:44.994 --> 53:46.597
After them!

53:56.005 --> 53:57.141
Giddy up, horsies.

54:06.849 --> 54:10.755
Release my ghost, you...
You ghost!

54:14.023 --> 54:15.192
Oh, no.

54:26.804 --> 54:29.037
A word to the wise,
Hunch, old boy.

54:29.039 --> 54:30.072
Uh-uh.

54:30.074 --> 54:32.139
Not a word out of you!

54:32.141 --> 54:35.776
Fool me once, shame on you.

54:35.778 --> 54:38.914
Fool me twice, shame on me.

54:38.916 --> 54:42.784
Fool me three times,
double shame on me!

54:42.786 --> 54:47.956
Fool me four times,
you get the jar, pal.

54:47.958 --> 54:50.958
Hunch, old buddy, my friends
will know exactly where I am.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.327
And when they come to
rescue me, let's face it,

54:53.329 --> 54:54.963
your Bogg friends
won't be a match

54:54.965 --> 54:57.268
for a fleet of ships and
soldiers, will they?

55:03.373 --> 55:08.075
Fool me five times,
it's back to shame on me.

55:08.077 --> 55:10.512
<i>These things are
never as bad as they seem.</i>

55:10.514 --> 55:13.749
<i>Let's just stay right here
and figure it out.</i>

55:13.751 --> 55:17.922
We have to persuade that Bogg
to let Scully go.

55:23.827 --> 55:26.161
- Okay, I'll do it.
- What?

55:26.163 --> 55:30.432
Weren't you going to tell me to get
in the jar and turn into a ghost?

55:30.434 --> 55:31.766
Why would I say that?

55:31.768 --> 55:36.838
So I can appear to Hunch as the
ghost of my alter ego, Green Thing.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.472
Well, how does that help?

55:38.474 --> 55:40.976
Because the Boggs
worship Green Thing,

55:40.978 --> 55:45.016
and if Green Thing tells them to
let Scully go, they'll do it.

55:46.250 --> 55:47.382
- Genius.
- Genius.

55:47.384 --> 55:48.883
Sheesh!

55:48.885 --> 55:51.855
Some people are a little slow
on the uptake.

55:54.157 --> 55:57.327
Sometimes it's best to let
him think it's his idea.

55:57.994 --> 55:58.996
Yup.

56:03.934 --> 56:06.967
I've passed
to the great beyond.

56:06.969 --> 56:08.369
It'll wear off in time.

56:08.371 --> 56:11.405
And if it doesn't,
you've had a wonderful life.

56:16.380 --> 56:19.751
I see. When he finishes...

56:20.284 --> 56:22.416
- Okay.
- Hunch.

56:22.418 --> 56:23.450
Green Thing.

56:25.121 --> 56:26.220
<i>C'est moi.</i>

56:26.222 --> 56:28.990
You died? I thought
you were immortal.

56:28.992 --> 56:32.260
- No, just awesome.
- But how?

56:32.262 --> 56:35.863
I had a cough. One thing led to another.
Look, the point is,

56:35.865 --> 56:39.333
<i>I have
a commandment for you.</i>

56:39.335 --> 56:42.304
You must let this ghost go!

56:42.306 --> 56:44.005
I...

56:44.007 --> 56:47.441
Don't ask me to do this.
You know I can't.

56:47.443 --> 56:50.445
You dare challenge
Green Thing?

56:50.447 --> 56:52.546
Forgive me, Green Thing.

56:52.548 --> 56:55.349
But this
is a matter of justice.

56:55.351 --> 56:57.251
Justice
is a good thing, right?

56:57.253 --> 57:01.322
How dare you lecture
Green Thing about justice!

57:01.324 --> 57:03.293
Now, keep your eyes shut,

57:04.628 --> 57:08.063
or Green Thing will make you
alive again

57:08.065 --> 57:11.932
just so he can make you
not alive again.

57:11.934 --> 57:12.936
Oh...

57:16.974 --> 57:19.307
What's going on here?

57:19.309 --> 57:21.211
Reincarnation?

57:28.652 --> 57:30.221
What's happened?

57:33.590 --> 57:36.624
No one fools me six times!

57:36.626 --> 57:39.130
I've got standards, you know!

57:44.635 --> 57:46.233
What?

57:49.639 --> 57:53.074
Now I suppose you're gonna say
I asked them here.

57:53.076 --> 57:55.276
Shh, you fool!
Let the good people talk.

57:55.278 --> 57:58.479
Obviously, you were right
about Antonio being back.

57:59.650 --> 58:01.115
I told you.

58:01.117 --> 58:02.684
No, I told them!

58:02.686 --> 58:04.519
I told them!

58:04.521 --> 58:06.021
No, I told them!

58:06.023 --> 58:08.392
You both told us! Okay?

58:12.663 --> 58:14.595
I can agree with that.

58:14.597 --> 58:16.498
Fine, we both said it.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.934
But, really, I said it.

58:18.936 --> 58:20.200
I heard that.

58:20.202 --> 58:22.003
Hold on.

58:22.005 --> 58:26.273
If you know how he thinks, you'll
tell us his next move. Now.

58:26.275 --> 58:28.677
In exchange for...

58:28.679 --> 58:32.115
How can you bargain
when lives are at stake?

58:36.452 --> 58:39.720
Fine, no deal. No deal. Right?

58:39.722 --> 58:41.389
Right.

58:41.391 --> 58:45.028
Fine. You'll rot in here,
just as you feared.

58:47.597 --> 58:52.233
Whatever he
would do has already happened.

58:52.235 --> 58:55.570
That doesn't
tell us anything.

58:55.572 --> 58:58.039
The children.

58:58.041 --> 59:01.178
No. No, that's impossible.

59:01.545 --> 59:03.313
Is it?

59:06.750 --> 59:09.383
No sign of the man
in black anywhere.

59:09.385 --> 59:11.418
Rogers.

59:11.420 --> 59:14.488
- Have you seen the children?
- I thought they were with you.

59:14.490 --> 59:16.324
We thought they were with you.

59:16.326 --> 59:19.094
- Have you seen the children?
- Uh... Mmm-mmm.

59:19.096 --> 59:21.298
Spy team, spread out.

59:23.132 --> 59:25.633
The only chance of finding
them are the rats.

59:25.635 --> 59:27.271
My thoughts exactly.

59:33.577 --> 59:36.080
Alise! Lucas! Where are you?

59:50.693 --> 59:52.626
That's him.

59:56.733 --> 59:58.235
Come on.

01:00:24.628 --> 01:00:25.997
What?

01:00:42.445 --> 01:00:43.614
Oh, no.

01:00:45.648 --> 01:00:46.815
Whoa, whoa.

01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:48.615
- No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
- No.

01:00:48.617 --> 01:00:50.520
Please, let me.

01:00:57.126 --> 01:00:58.329
Careful, Derek.

01:01:00.362 --> 01:01:03.398
Papa, I'm so sorry.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.635
You've got nothing
to be sorry for, Alise.

01:01:06.402 --> 01:01:07.534
Now, let's see.

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:17.479
It's no good, Prince Derek. If
one of us tries to step out,

01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:20.280
the scale tips,
and the other one will fall.

01:01:20.282 --> 01:01:23.186
I can see that.
Do you trust me?

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:30.157
Now, jump to me on three.

01:01:30.159 --> 01:01:33.427
One, two, three!

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:36.600
Papa.

01:01:40.737 --> 01:01:44.307
One, two, three!

01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:54.148
Take the children
to safety, Odette.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.885
He's after you, Derek.
I won't leave you here.

01:01:57.887 --> 01:02:01.357
But the children!
It's not safe here.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.793
Derek.

01:02:05.795 --> 01:02:08.132
Go, Odette. Go.

01:02:13.637 --> 01:02:17.371
Odette, if this is the end,

01:02:17.373 --> 01:02:20.110
just know that I have
always loved you.

01:02:21.244 --> 01:02:23.778
This is not the end.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.418
Do you hear? Not the end!

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:35.923
The great Antonio Zambrano.

01:02:35.925 --> 01:02:38.659
Back together
with Nicollo again?

01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:43.363
Where is he? Not brave enough
to show his face?

01:02:43.365 --> 01:02:45.465
Oh, quite the contrary.

01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:51.206
I thought
he was supposed to be a smarty.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.177
Only according to his mother.

01:02:54.945 --> 01:02:58.378
But truly,
I do cherish her book.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:05.355
I learned about every living creature
responsible for ruining my plan.

01:03:08.925 --> 01:03:12.827
Then I marked each one
for revenge.

01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:18.233
Your end will only
take the few seconds

01:03:18.235 --> 01:03:21.635
required to fall
to the bottom.

01:03:21.637 --> 01:03:27.342
But the others, the others
will die a little each day

01:03:27.344 --> 01:03:32.516
for having lost
their beloved Prince Derek.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.583
Come, it's not my fault.

01:03:35.585 --> 01:03:38.952
We wouldn't even be here
if you hadn't been so lucky

01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:43.324
as to avoid the chandelier
and the sewer trap.

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:45.425
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

01:03:45.427 --> 01:03:48.329
Some people have friends,
real ones,

01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:51.335
the kind who'll do anything
for the people they love.

01:03:52.369 --> 01:03:54.969
Did you hear that,
my lovelies?

01:03:54.971 --> 01:03:57.905
Actually, Derek,
they're quite devoted.

01:03:57.907 --> 01:04:01.342
And more effective
than your friends.

01:04:01.344 --> 01:04:04.345
After all,
you are going to lose.

01:04:04.347 --> 01:04:06.483
I do have one last question.

01:04:06.949 --> 01:04:08.516
Why the Z?

01:04:08.518 --> 01:04:09.883
Oh, Derek.

01:04:12.722 --> 01:04:15.226
I'm disappointed in you.

01:04:17.827 --> 01:04:19.526
Nicollo.

01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:21.963
If only you had
more time in life,

01:04:21.965 --> 01:04:25.999
perhaps then you would have learned
to look beyond the obvious.

01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:28.838
I was about to say the same
thing to you.

01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:38.780
Oh, Derek, I have
underestimated you.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.507
That's it. I've had it!

01:05:06.509 --> 01:05:10.478
Let them come
and try to rescue him!

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.081
Then we'll have all the
pink bellies we can eat!

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:16.784
Meat! Meat! Meat!

01:05:16.786 --> 01:05:18.820
No! Listen to me!

01:05:18.822 --> 01:05:23.490
The pink bellies
are not to be taken lightly.

01:05:23.492 --> 01:05:25.092
They've got
those things, the...

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.930
And the...

01:05:29.932 --> 01:05:31.965
And the...

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:33.836
If they come here,

01:05:34.737 --> 01:05:36.637
that's all, folks.

01:05:36.639 --> 01:05:39.706
- Let them try!
- Yeah!

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:42.512
Meat! Meat! Meat!

01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:51.321
Like I'm gonna do that.

01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:58.959
Please, Hunch,
all I want in the whole world

01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:01.095
is to know my friends
are safe.

01:06:01.097 --> 01:06:04.999
If you let me go,
I promise I'll come back.

01:06:05.001 --> 01:06:07.403
Not possible.

01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:14.744
What?

01:06:16.612 --> 01:06:19.746
- What now?
- Hunch, please.

01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:22.016
If you let me go, I...

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:27.854
I will make the pink bellies promise
to never come rescue me. Ever.

01:06:27.856 --> 01:06:31.762
Why would you sacrifice
everything for them?

01:06:34.197 --> 01:06:35.899
Because they would
do it for me.

01:06:44.574 --> 01:06:46.476
You better take this.

01:06:47.476 --> 01:06:49.543
I will be back.

01:06:49.545 --> 01:06:51.647
You better keep your word.

01:06:59.789 --> 01:07:02.760
No! No!

01:07:03.893 --> 01:07:04.894
Derek.

01:07:05.996 --> 01:07:09.664
- <i>Skinny Professor.</i>
- Skinny Professor here.

01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:12.200
<i>Come join me, fast as you can.</i>

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:13.700
Derek's at the hangar.

01:07:13.702 --> 01:07:16.840
Puffin, get Odette.

01:07:23.579 --> 01:07:25.479
Whoa!

01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:27.748
They'll search
the pit for you,

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:33.019
but you're going to disappear in
a way they'll never find you.

01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:38.528
And, you know, this prototype
certainly had its share of problems,

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:45.833
but it always did
one thing well. Sink.

01:07:45.835 --> 01:07:48.739
But just in case
you get free...

01:07:52.175 --> 01:07:57.815
Poor Derek. So many friends, but not a single one in sight.

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:03.454
Here, take one of mine.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.655
Bon voyage.

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:27.978
Derek.

01:08:30.613 --> 01:08:33.113
Puffin, the winch.

01:08:33.115 --> 01:08:35.917
- I'm on it, Princess!
- Come on.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:56.840
Oh!

01:09:08.051 --> 01:09:09.149
It's no good.

01:09:09.152 --> 01:09:10.685
- Oh, dear.
- No.

01:09:16.926 --> 01:09:19.662
- <i>Skinny Professor.</i>
- Scully.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:28.201
- Scully.
- I'm with Derek. What can I do?

01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:30.705
Tell me what you see.

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:33.941
Dials, knobs, gauges, levers.
I don't know. Why?

01:09:33.943 --> 01:09:37.010
There was a surface lever,
but Nicollo broke it off.

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:39.714
Oh, Derek, so good
to hear your voice.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:44.153
Is there anything
that can improvise as a lever?

01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:48.356
- A straight wrench.
- <i>Jam it in.</i>

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:50.323
Negative.
Derek is tied up tight.

01:09:50.326 --> 01:09:52.125
Then you do it.

01:09:52.127 --> 01:09:53.162
No. Never mind.

01:10:06.876 --> 01:10:09.376
It's a catchy tune,
Derek, but focus.

01:10:23.225 --> 01:10:24.959
It fits.

01:10:26.194 --> 01:10:27.394
It won't move.

01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:29.397
No, it won't just yet.

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.799
Follow my directions closely.

01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:35.672
There should be a discombobulator
box by your knees.

01:10:36.738 --> 01:10:38.906
- Got it.
- Re-pressurize it

01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:41.878
by disconnecting
and reconnecting it.

01:10:46.015 --> 01:10:47.882
Done.

01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:50.151
Not much time to figure this
out, Scully.

01:10:50.153 --> 01:10:53.286
Now, nincomfit the cogmaster.

01:10:53.288 --> 01:10:54.688
How?

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:56.158
Give it a good smack.

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:03.430
It worked.

01:11:03.432 --> 01:11:07.069
Now, push down the rise lever.

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:11.438
- <i>Derek!</i>
- He's losing consciousness.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.307
There's not enough oxygen.

01:11:13.309 --> 01:11:15.878
Derek, listen to me!

01:11:16.112 --> 01:11:17.780
<i>Derek!</i>

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.882
He's passed out.

01:11:22.018 --> 01:11:24.855
Derek, it's me.

01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:28.923
My darling,
you can't sleep now.

01:11:28.925 --> 01:11:32.793
Not now. Take a breath, Derek.

01:11:32.795 --> 01:11:34.864
<i>You can do this.</i>

01:11:46.442 --> 01:11:50.814

01:11:51.314 --> 01:11:52.812
It's working.

01:11:57.953 --> 01:12:02.024

01:12:05.194 --> 01:12:07.230
Oh, my friends...

01:12:08.096 --> 01:12:09.733
Derek.

01:12:31.854 --> 01:12:32.956
Boo!

01:12:50.006 --> 01:12:51.173
Boo!

01:13:00.248 --> 01:13:01.415
It worked.

01:13:03.252 --> 01:13:04.955
Quick. Outside.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.174
- Prince Derek!
- Prince Derek!

01:13:43.259 --> 01:13:45.060
Going somewhere?

01:13:49.966 --> 01:13:52.599
Can I at least
go say goodbye?

01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:54.336
You're not going anywhere.

01:13:55.104 --> 01:13:56.202
Friends?

01:13:57.439 --> 01:13:59.208
Friends.

01:14:01.476 --> 01:14:03.279
How'd I do, Mama?

01:14:03.546 --> 01:14:04.948
Huh?

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.349
Well, I'm trying.

01:14:41.516 --> 01:14:43.983
What are you waiting for?

01:14:43.985 --> 01:14:47.254
What? No, no, come back!
No! Come back!

01:14:47.256 --> 01:14:48.925
Get me down!

01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:56.664
So, in a way,
my book was responsible...

01:14:56.666 --> 01:15:00.134
Please, Uberta, we don't want
you to feel responsible for...

01:15:00.136 --> 01:15:03.473
For bringing down
Nicollo, too?

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.005
Yes. Exactly.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:09.011
Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.452
It's time for a sequel,
baby!
