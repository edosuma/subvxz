WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:06.337
Baltimore P.D.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.794
Come out, Stansbury.
We got a warrant.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.384
We know you're here, Scottie.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.670
Come on out.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.004
Make this easier.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.232
Hold on, please.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.608
If you take me in...

00:27.778 --> 00:30.987
...if my parole officer
finds out I've been using...

00:34.576 --> 00:36.238
What's going on?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.071
I'm sorry, Scottie.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.372
McGinnis.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.247
McGinnis.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.260
What the hell happened?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.346
I just...

00:57.516 --> 01:00.224
He drew. He fired.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.598
Is he...?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.681
He's dead.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.104
You came in. What...?

01:09.278 --> 01:11.019
You had no choice.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.609
You had to fire, right?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.614
He had a gun.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.696
Yeah, I had to fire.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.830
<i>McGinnis.</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:25.416
Hey. Can you hear me?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.576
Yes.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.167
I got nothing to hide.
I'll waive my Garrity Rights.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.549
- I was following protocol.
- I'm sure IA will confirm...

01:33.885 --> 01:37.549
...but right now I want you
to go home and call a lawyer.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.261
You need a lawyer.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.439
Sure nobody followed you?

01:57.034 --> 02:00.118
Password to the account.
Funds are now available.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.536
I didn't think it'd be this bad.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.202
You're alive, Officer McGinnis...

02:09.755 --> 02:12.964
...which is more than we can say
for Scottie Stansbury.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.041
You've done your job.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.502
Now let me do mine.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.715
What's up, buttercup?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.635
Change your mind, decide to join me,
Gary in the hot tub?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.888
Yeah. Tonight? Maybe.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.468
It's the scab?

03:03.642 --> 03:07.181
Oh, no, no, no. Gary's...

03:07.354 --> 03:10.313
...Gary. I'm distracted.
I locked myself out.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.350
I don't wanna go to the lobby.
I was hoping to use your phone.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.985
Oh, yes, of course, silly.
Get in here.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.770
You coming to social hour?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.235
Gonna bring Daddy's
favorite little pickle bites.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.196
I've no idea what that means.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.577
I spread cream cheese
on a slice of beef...

03:24.746 --> 03:27.784
...wrap it up around a dill,
put a toothpick in him.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.574
Real good.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.368
Dariush. It's Bruno.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.536
I'm sorry.

03:33.714 --> 03:38.175
I... I somehow locked myself out of my
room, and I was hoping...

03:39.928 --> 03:41.760
Right. No. Oh, no, that's fine.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.472
That'd be great. Wait. I found it.

03:44.641 --> 03:49.761
No, never mind. I... Yeah, right here,
in my pocket of all places.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.518
Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.144
I'll tell Gary we'll hot tub at 8.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.153
Don't forget the pickle bites.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.965
Dembe.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.142
Yeah.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.271
Did you get a plate number?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.394
Okay.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.644
Who is this guy?
What medical expert agrees...

04:39.821 --> 04:42.279
- ...to covertly identify human remains?
- I'm sorry.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.738
I didn't realize he needed a rÃ©sumÃ©
and a urine sample to get the job.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.449
You asked for help,
I'm getting you help...

04:48.622 --> 04:51.239
- ...and breaking the law.
- Yeah, for Liz.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.658
Right. For Liz.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.168
That worked out well last time.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.755
He's a friend of yours, this Pete?

04:59.925 --> 05:03.418
He has access to the kinds
of medical equipment you need.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.713
That guy?

05:06.890 --> 05:08.552
Did he go to medical school?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.263
He was the smartest kid at Harvard
during my residency.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.177
Then he sort of dropped out.

05:13.355 --> 05:17.725
Today, he's plugged into some kind
of network of criminal drug activities.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.642
You two should get along swimmingly.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.686
What up, Nikky?

05:21.863 --> 05:24.071
You got gray as grandma.
You must be...

05:24.241 --> 05:26.608
- Tom.
- Cool fake name. You a cop?

05:26.785 --> 05:29.243
- Forget it.
- This isn't a joke, Pete.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.278
- I don't know your friend.
- My mistake.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.789
I never should've come to you for help.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.416
Shut up, both of you.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.253
He's not a cop, and you are
the smartest guy I've ever met.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.961
Destroyed me in boards, I know you're
smart enough to run this DNA test...

05:43.134 --> 05:46.127
...take the money you clearly need,
and keep your mouth shut.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.255
Those remains, if they're damaged...

05:49.432 --> 05:53.301
...exposed to air, natural elements,
pulling DNA might be difficult.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.312
I can do it, maybe,
but it's gonna take time.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.098
I guess you should stop talking,
get to work.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.285
Dembe told me you moved
out of your hotel.

06:11.454 --> 06:15.539
Sadly, my time
at the Terrace Vista has run out.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.826
So, what, you're apartment hunting?

06:18.003 --> 06:19.585
Yes.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.964
While you go on a hunt
for some dirty cops.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.009
I believe the unfortunate incident
with Officer McGinnis...

06:31.182 --> 06:33.299
...was far more
than the stuff of headlines.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.059
I believe it was premeditated murder.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.937
It says here the victim shot first.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.100
I still have a few friends
among the men in blue.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.690
They're whispering
that the scene was staged...

06:44.863 --> 06:47.276
...by a well-compensated mercenary.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.941
McGinnis, a paid-for killer?

06:51.661 --> 06:54.745
But according to this article,
he has a clean record.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.372
The perfect alibi.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.908
An officer well-respected
by his peers...

06:59.085 --> 07:01.498
...paid by your government
to carry a weapon...

07:01.671 --> 07:03.583
...to protect and serve the citizenry...

07:03.757 --> 07:07.250
...but I'm telling you,
Officer McGinnis is a killer...

07:07.427 --> 07:09.293
...and he's not the only one.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.929
Killer cops for hire?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.215
Who's hiring them?

07:15.268 --> 07:19.228
Whoever it is, this isn't the first police
shooting they're responsible for...

07:19.397 --> 07:22.686
...and unless you find them,
it won't be the last.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.352
Andrew McGinnis. Rookie officer
without a blemish on his record.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.191
The victim was Scott Stansbury...

07:28.365 --> 07:31.028
...spent 20 years
bouncing between prison cells...

07:31.201 --> 07:33.568
- ...parole hearings and rehab.
- And the pistol?

07:33.745 --> 07:36.704
- The one Red said was planted?
- Registered to another owner...

07:36.873 --> 07:38.830
...who reported it stolen
three weeks ago.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.582
Stansbury was never a suspect.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.460
There's an investigation.
Why not let it play out?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.838
IA could spend months
filing those reports.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.919
- More people could die by then.
- Look...

07:48.093 --> 07:51.803
...I know it's not politically correct
to say this, but cops don't kill people.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.430
- They protect them.
- Most of them do.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.555
But ones who let anger, emotion, prejudice
and carelessness affect their behavior...

07:58.728 --> 08:01.846
...are every good cop's worst nightmare.
Keen, talk to McGinnis.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.561
See if something feels off.
Ressler, visit the partner.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.726
I wanna get to the bottom of this.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.233
You kicked the door down
even though you got no response?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.899
No. We went in
because we had a warrant.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.533
The guy violated parole.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.071
- And when you got inside?
- Nothing. It was quiet.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.740
Noise on the TV, I guess.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.907
We split up.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.828
- Parker went one way. I went the other.
- Where you saw him?

08:25.005 --> 08:28.794
Right. He was dumping evidence,
dope, probably, down the drain.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.583
<i>He saw me, pulled a gun...</i>

08:30.760 --> 08:34.845
- Next thing I hear, four shots.
- He fired first, two shots, so I returned.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.383
- But his shots both missed.
- Luckiest rookie son of a bitch I ever seen.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.892
Which shot hit him?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.057
Which shot?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.267
He was hit once.
You said you fired twice.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.525
I assume you remember which missed,
and which didn't.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.907
He's dirty.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.283
Why do you say that?

08:56.453 --> 08:59.412
Said he shot twice,
and the second shot hit him.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.904
Well, that's odd.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.745
It's the second that goes high
off the kick of the first.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.784
Like I said...

09:06.463 --> 09:08.295
...he's dirty.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.437
Did you miss me, sweetheart?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.569
Oh, that's nice.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.904
So nice.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.784
I missed you too.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.299
Word to the not-so-wise:

10:00.767 --> 10:02.599
When you come for someone...

10:02.769 --> 10:05.933
...don't show up in a rental car under
your name and local address.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.893
You never delivered the guns.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.479
Two months,
Rivera's fighting BLO without them.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.065
Well, he won't get them if I'm dead.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.948
By the by, what's with the boots?
You guys do a lot of riding?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.485
Our brothers are dying.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.655
Because of you,
they cannot defend themselves.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.744
How many has Rivera sent for me?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.909
Enough to get the job done.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.461
Tell him that won't be necessary.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.795
He'll have his guns within 36 hours.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.595
<i>A shipment of guns?</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:41.221
You have no guns.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.757
Or money to buy them.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.926
Or a plane to deliver them in.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.935
This is impossible.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.722
No, Dembe.
That periodontist from Tarkio?

10:49.899 --> 10:54.439
She was impossible.
This is simply improbable.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.729
I wanna make
my clients' position clear:

10:56.906 --> 10:58.693
Their son was unarmed
when he was shot.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.031
- Tell that to the cop that he shot at.
- That cop murdered our son.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.445
If that's what our
investigation determines...

11:04.622 --> 11:06.204
...that officer may go to prison.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.330
I'm sorry, Miss Thrall,
but there's something I need to say.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.584
We discussed this.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.461
This was our fault.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.792
What was?

11:14.966 --> 11:16.047
All of it.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.381
When Scottie was a little boy,
we didn't have money.

11:19.554 --> 11:24.345
We moved to this dump of a place.
We didn't know about the lead paint.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.976
- It made him sick.
- The Stansburys lived in public housing.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.931
Lead paint in their unit left Scott
cognitively impaired.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.858
We sued and were awarded
a structured settlement...

11:35.028 --> 11:36.985
...a little under half a million dollars.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.317
- Structured settlement?
- The money was to be...

11:40.658 --> 11:42.570
...disbursed over decades.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.701
Like a paycheck every month for Scott.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.954
But then Waterday showed up...

11:47.123 --> 11:49.740
...waving a $100,000
in front of Scottie.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.161
- They offered a lump sum.
- Yeah, 20 cents on the dollar.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.249
Of course, he didn't see that.

11:55.423 --> 11:59.417
He just saw a check for more money
than he ever dreamed of.

12:01.429 --> 12:05.514
There ain't no way
that my boy shot at that officer.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.142
But for him to be in a
position where that is a question?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.267
No. I blame Waterday for that.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.682
I gotta go make a phone call.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.691
Waterday.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.773
Tell me more about them.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.360
<i>- Took you long enough.</i>
- I'm not your errand boy.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.649
No. You're my indentured servant...

12:23.826 --> 12:26.159
...and will be until
you repay the debt you owe...

12:26.329 --> 12:29.663
...for hiding your mishap with
the national security advisor's skull.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.825
You got no play. Can't sell me out
without implicating yourself.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.460
True. Maybe I'm not willing to do that.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.792
Or maybe I'm bluffing.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.291
<i>You gonna call my bluff, Ressler?</i>

12:40.468 --> 12:44.257
<i>Or are you gonna go fetch me that car
before the cops process it?</i>

12:44.430 --> 12:47.764
Text me the license and registration.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.508
Hey.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.598
What's going on?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.979
Look, a friend of mine...

12:54.148 --> 12:55.480
...he did something.

12:55.650 --> 12:58.688
Instead of coming clean,
he's digging a deeper hole.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.524
And he needs you to dig himself out?

13:01.948 --> 13:03.530
Something like that.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.114
- Okay. Go. I got this.
- Thanks, Keen.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.708
<i>Attention.</i>

13:22.885 --> 13:29.678
<i>Registration and insurance is at 443.</i>

13:29.851 --> 13:32.434
<i>Room 443.</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:36.309
<i>Registration and insurance, 443.</i>

13:41.779 --> 13:42.815
Eighty-three?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.605
Number 83?

13:44.782 --> 13:47.695
Let's go, lamb chop.
You're not getting younger.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.408
This is the first time
you've made it a priority to see me...

13:51.581 --> 13:52.822
...I appreciate that.

13:52.999 --> 13:53.989
Thank you, Glen.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.285
Truth is, you looked sort of...

13:57.462 --> 14:01.752
...blue sitting out there all alone
in that stew of humanity.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.507
- Made my heart squeeze.
- Your heart?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.010
I like poking you, watch you bristle...

14:07.180 --> 14:09.593
...but after all you've been through...

14:09.766 --> 14:11.177
...it don't feel right.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.058
The thrill is gone.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.890
It's been unpredictable.

14:16.064 --> 14:20.104
How are the mighty fallen
in the midst of battle.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.060
I knew you would show up
sooner or later, hat in hand...

14:23.237 --> 14:25.320
...begging for help from old Jellybean.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.480
What do you need?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.986
A million dollars.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.864
Are you dicking with me?

14:32.038 --> 14:35.531
I'm a government employee.
I make 44 grand a year.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.542
Of which you don't spend a cent.
You live with your mother...

14:38.711 --> 14:41.920
...and I'm confident you've amassed
a nice nest egg...

14:42.090 --> 14:45.254
...from all your various
extracurricular activities.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.418
Go ahead. Kiss the ring, sport.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.887
I'm gonna need to hear the details.

14:50.932 --> 14:56.098
I need a million cash.
Not to keep, to borrow. For two days.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.104
Glen, please.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.481
This is important.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.523
Hey.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.440
Who loves you, baby?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.908
Waterday buys a ton
of structured settlements...

15:16.082 --> 15:18.074
...mostly from people like
Scott Stansbury.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.914
People without the ability
to know they're duped.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.000
The lump sum offered
may be unseemly. It isn't a crime.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.334
Other companies do this.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.125
Reddington said someone
is paying cops to commit murder.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.168
Does the settlement
support that theory?

15:30.346 --> 15:34.056
Well, maybe, or maybe it's just
a really odd coincidence...

15:34.225 --> 15:36.842
...but Waterday doesn't
just buy structured settlements.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.057
They also make loans, some of
the loans they make are to cops.

15:40.231 --> 15:45.147
And just last month, one of the cops who
had gotten a loan is Officer McGinnis.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.982
The same cop
who shot Scott Stansbury.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.694
The same company
that bought the victim's settlement...

15:50.867 --> 15:54.156
- ...loaned to the cop who shot him?
- That cannot be a coincidence.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.320
Of course it's a coincidence.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.113
We're a nationwide company.

15:58.291 --> 16:03.286
We made over 1400 home loans in the
past fiscal year, 174 of them to cops.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.252
This was bound to happen.
That's what you're saying, Mr. Johnson?

16:07.425 --> 16:10.964
What we do matters to the officers
looking to buy a home...

16:11.137 --> 16:13.925
...and to victims,
like Scottie Stansbury who...

16:14.098 --> 16:18.012
...thanks to us, don't have to wait
for money to slowly drip in.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.975
With the lump sum,
they can pay for college, start a business.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.562
We'll need documents pertaining
to structured settlements.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.940
And loans you made to members
of the Baltimore Police Department.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.149
Do you have a warrant?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.113
We can get one if you insist.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.401
- I do insist, and you won't get one.
- And why is that?

16:35.578 --> 16:38.491
You need to convince a judge
what you think is going on here.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.951
Which is as obvious as it is offensive:

16:41.125 --> 16:43.458
A payoff to a cop
to get him to commit murder.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.960
Is that what it was?

16:47.006 --> 16:47.996
Okay.

16:48.424 --> 16:53.544
See, the structured settlements we buy
only pay out as long as the victim is alive.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.431
Now, we paid Mr. Stansbury
$100,000 for his settlement.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.560
At the time of his death,
we had recouped 62,000.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.142
Sure, someone may
have wanted him dead...

17:04.315 --> 17:05.851
...but not us.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.733
His death cost us a fortune.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.353
Jennifer, of course you're conflicted.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.695
It's just... My sister is sick,
but this really crosses a line.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.234
No, it isn't only about money...

17:18.412 --> 17:20.028
...or paying for an operation...

17:20.205 --> 17:22.242
...or saving your sister's life.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.032
It's also about the victim.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.040
His name is Robert Urwiller,
and he's suffering.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.129
Robert's cognitively impaired...

17:33.302 --> 17:36.466
...and no settlement amount
will ever make him whole.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.847
His pain aside, look at his record.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.507
The assaults.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.766
The prison time.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.853
Jennifer, when I vet these candidates...

17:46.023 --> 17:48.515
...I carefully consider
everyone involved.

17:49.193 --> 17:54.063
Statistics show it's unlikely Robert
will even ever make his 45th birthday.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.113
But you can let him go.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.700
You can end his suffering...

18:02.373 --> 18:05.457
...and save your sister's life
in the process.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.501
You busted me out to help you
strategize, and I'm telling you...

18:15.678 --> 18:19.547
...we need a covert landing strip where
these boys can belly down a Gulfstream.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.636
That means a minimum
of 500 meters...

18:21.809 --> 18:27.055
...of well-camouflaged pavement
that ain't monitored by radar or FAA.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.644
He doesn't have the capital
for a covert runway.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.059
- Was I talking to you?
- Smokey, please.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.068
Raymond, you're broke.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.231
Now, I can promise you
that this moron will run his mouth...

18:37.408 --> 18:40.822
...with hare-brained ideas
as long as there's air in the room...

18:40.995 --> 18:44.363
...but those ideas won't
float if you can't pay for them.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.281
As your financial planner...

18:46.459 --> 18:49.167
...I have a fiduciary obligation
to point out...

18:49.337 --> 18:53.047
So the racketeer who cut
a deal with the feds for embezzling...

18:53.215 --> 18:54.831
...has a "fiduciary obligation"?

18:55.009 --> 18:57.843
You button your lip and figure out
where to park the plane.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.254
- I got a place.
- Is that fact? Where?

19:00.431 --> 19:03.048
- Bend over and I'll show you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.059
Listen, you two need
to find a covert runway.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.515
I don't care if you have to build it.

19:08.689 --> 19:13.275
Just find it and try not
to kill each other in the process.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.276
Tom, right on cue.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.857
Liz said you wanted to see me?

19:17.031 --> 19:20.490
Yes, about a certain business
venture I'm pursuing.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.243
I think you'd fit right in.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.037
AUSA agreed we don't have
enough for warrant.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.416
Yeah, a cop who got a loan
from Waterday shot a man...

19:29.585 --> 19:32.578
- ...whose settlement was bought by them.
- And they lost money.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.747
Plus, we only had one example...

19:34.924 --> 19:37.883
...but seems like one more
than anyone would need.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.216
But since it wasn't, we reviewed
the class-action lawsuit...

19:41.389 --> 19:43.176
...Stansbury was a part of.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.308
Now, out of 179 plaintiffs...

19:46.477 --> 19:48.560
...four sold their settlements
to Waterday.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.222
Stansbury and these three.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.184
My God.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.150
Two were shot by police
after high-speed chases.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.406
<i>The other charged an officer
with a knife.</i>

20:01.575 --> 20:02.656
<i>Suicide by cop.</i>

20:02.827 --> 20:05.035
And the cops got loans
from Waterday?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.743
Loans that, as far as we can tell,
they've never paid back.

20:08.916 --> 20:13.035
<i>We don't know why, but Waterday
appears to be financing assassinations.</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:16.080
<i>Get this to AUSA. Have them
pull search and arrest warrants.</i>

20:16.257 --> 20:19.216
And find Ressler.
We need all hands on deck.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.503
- FBI. Step away from your desks.
- Who's in charge of cybersecurity?

20:22.680 --> 20:24.842
I am. Mr. Johnson's secretary.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.388
Where's your boss?

20:36.610 --> 20:37.600
It's your office.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.197
Rhona knows not to call me
unless it's an emergency.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.159
Hey, what's up?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.987
And they showed you a warrant?

20:49.165 --> 20:51.327
And what did they take?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.830
You know what?
Forget it. I'm on my way in.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.705
The FBI just raided the office.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.884
Did you hear what I said?
The feds know.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.545
They're pulling the files, Rebecca.
What...?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.431
Rebecca, come on.
Let me up. We're in trouble.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.183
"We"?

21:10.895 --> 21:14.479
They're pulling your files
from your office.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.608
Wait. Wait. Wait.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.191
Wait. Wait. Wait. Come on.
What are you...? Rebecca.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.150
Rebecca. Hey.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.906
Hey.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.131
Raymond Reddington.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.840
They said you were out of the game.
Taken down by an old lady, no less.

21:46.013 --> 21:50.098
Yes, and to think I've always had
such good fortune with older women.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.679
Who's the boy?

21:51.852 --> 21:55.812
Levi Edwards, my munitions man.
He'll be inspecting the merchandise.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.394
Why should I make a deal with you?

21:58.734 --> 22:02.227
Until today, you dismissed me
as a thick-necked sea lion.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.863
I believe I said "walrus."
I don't remember. I was drunk.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.197
We're here for guns:
.50 caliber, G3s, as discussed.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.113
- You brought money as discussed?
- Money won't be a problem.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.621
Money's always a problem.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.204
I hear it may be your biggest problem.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.205
Adika, I didn't come here
to waste my time or watch you eat.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.591
You've been trying to get me
to kiss you into the business for years.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.674
I'm here at your table to do just that,
so put down the fork...

22:31.058 --> 22:32.924
Where's the money?

22:33.394 --> 22:35.932
I said it won't be a problem.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.523
This doesn't feel right.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.309
You don't feel right.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.523
On the contrary. I've never felt better.

22:44.738 --> 22:49.324
Now put away the gun before
you do something you'll regret.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.572
This feels like a setup, no?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.577
Okay, okay, I'm here.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.285
I know I'm late. Traffic was a bitch.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.003
Easy. I'm ticklish.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.543
Who the hell is this?

23:08.971 --> 23:11.429
Geynor Collins, TG&L Lending.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.010
I'm the money man.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.891
The one who makes
the magic happen.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.350
What are you eating?
Smells like duck.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.188
A million reasons for you to have
faith in my financial fortitude.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.107
We'll need the merchandise
delivered by the end of day.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.776
Leave the money.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.319
I will make some calls.

23:34.705 --> 23:38.289
Forgive the overt mistrust, but
I'm not going to hand you a penny...

23:38.459 --> 23:41.293
...till Mr. Edwards has had a chance
to inspect the shipment.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.669
No deal, then.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.204
I need collateral.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.876
Then take Edwards.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.637
If there's a bump in the road,
do with him as you wish.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.718
Get your merchandise in order.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.179
I'll call you with
a rendezvous site shortly.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.808
We can make this work.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.438
I'll take your word for it.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.894
Take him.

24:06.487 --> 24:07.853
Really?

24:17.414 --> 24:20.282
<i>Yes, I'm on my way.
Forty-five minutes tops.</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:23.418
Smokey, Buhari's plane is supposed
to land here in four hours.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.705
If I were throwing a picnic,
it'd be lovely, but there are trees.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.544
<i>The runway will be ready.</i>

24:28.717 --> 24:31.425
Tell that wizard
the McClintock boys are here.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.803
Where is he?
We need the shovels and chainsaws.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.760
Shovels and chainsaws.

24:35.933 --> 24:39.051
Tell her to button her lip.
I got shovels and chainsaws.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.639
Smokey, if this doesn't work...

24:40.813 --> 24:43.271
<i>Mr. Reddington, trust me on this.</i>

24:43.440 --> 24:47.059
We're going to belly that gun-runner's
plane in that field, so help me God.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.104
I just need 45 minutes
to get Leroy and Quackers there.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.067
We'll jive then, my friend.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.408
Who the hell are Leroy and Quackers?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.159
<i>Based on the insurance records...</i>

24:57.329 --> 24:59.821
...I think I figured out the next target.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.160
<i>Insurance records?</i>

25:01.333 --> 25:03.120
Waterday's in the insurance business?

25:03.293 --> 25:05.330
<i>No, but they take out a ton of it.</i>

25:05.504 --> 25:08.747
Life insurance policies on the people
whose settlements they buy.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.962
Johnson said the company
paid Stansbury $100,000...

25:12.136 --> 25:14.549
...but they had
only received 62,000...

25:14.722 --> 25:17.135
...when Stansbury died
and the payments stopped.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.924
True. Waterday lost a few
thousand on the settlement...

25:20.102 --> 25:24.312
...but they took out a $5 million
policy on Stansbury's life.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.474
So when he died,
they made a fortune.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.519
Let me guess: they had policies
on the other victims too.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.983
- Isn't that a little obvious?
<i>- Yes and no.</i>

25:33.157 --> 25:36.992
First, Waterday had policies on all of the
people whose settlements they bought.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.528
Not just the victims,
and second, the victims.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.914
<i>It looks like they pick ones
who are living on quote unquote...</i>

25:43.083 --> 25:45.120
<i>... "borrowed time."
Cancer victims. Addicts.</i>

25:45.294 --> 25:48.662
People whose illnesses may explain
the type of erratic behavior...

25:48.839 --> 25:51.673
...that could result
in a deadly altercation with the police.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.505
And the next target,
you said you might know who that is?

25:54.678 --> 25:58.342
<i>Yes. Based on the three knowns:
the recipient of a structured settlement...</i>

25:58.515 --> 26:02.680
...a pre-existing medical condition,
and a large insurance policy on their life.

26:02.853 --> 26:06.563
I found one name in the
Waterday database: Robert Urwiller.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.400
Let me get two of them scratchers.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.610
Might be my lucky day.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.914
Let's get that last maple
to the south pulled.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.835
That oak too.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.874
Mikey and John, run a string line,
mow me some threshold markings.

26:34.051 --> 26:39.388
Humberto, check our compaction
in the touchdown zone. Chip-chop.

26:39.556 --> 26:43.140
Chip-chop-chip, folks.
Showtime in 20.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.803
My land. They don't make men
like that anymore, do they?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.097
Thank the Lord.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.260
That's it, huh?

27:20.430 --> 27:22.046
- Yep.
- Was it brought in like that?

27:22.224 --> 27:24.181
No idea. Sign here.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.519
Thanks.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.204
- Ressler.
- Whatever you're doing has to wait.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.247
The situation's been handled.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.455
<i>Good, because we got a location
on the Blacklister's next target.</i>

27:55.340 --> 27:56.706
<i>Ressler.</i>

27:56.884 --> 27:58.420
<i>Ressler, you there?</i>

27:58.594 --> 27:59.675
I'm on my way.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.298
Smokey, you were born
a century too late.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.715
You're a miracle worker.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.727
Heddie, I can't thank you enough
for keeping us on budget.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.103
You had no budget.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.264
Well, there you are.

28:28.582 --> 28:29.993
It's him.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.162
This ought to be interesting.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.750
Agent Keen, I've got Urwiller's car
heading east on Irving Street.

28:35.923 --> 28:40.293
- Do you have a vehicle description?
- Look for a 1994 tan Toyota Tercel...

28:40.469 --> 28:43.177
- ...which made a left on Georgia.
- You can't get his cell?

28:43.347 --> 28:45.885
I've tried a dozen times.
Trying again now.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.745
Mr. Cooper,
I spoke with Agent Ressler...

29:13.919 --> 29:16.787
...and gave him Keen's 10-20.
He's en route as we speak.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.878
- And Urwiller? You make contact?
- Not yet, but we're still trying.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.646
On my damn cell phone. Sorry.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.566
License and registration, please.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.938
I'm sorry...

29:40.112 --> 29:41.819
License and registration.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.572
Aram, we have eyes.
There's a unit on scene.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.408
- Notify Annapolis Police. Get cars there.
- Copy that.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.824
What are you doing?

29:59.381 --> 30:00.792
FBI.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.047
Drop your weapon.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.630
Put the gun down.
I won't warn you again.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.515
Adika, how was your flight in?

30:18.692 --> 30:20.775
Bumpy as hell.
Are you trying to kill us all?

30:20.944 --> 30:23.607
I picked the site
for its magnificent views.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.649
- Levi, you look well.
- Any chance we could untie me?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.409
Adika, I appreciate the good faith...

30:30.579 --> 30:32.912
...and if your merchandise
is as good as I hear...

30:33.081 --> 30:36.199
...there's no end to what you
and I could...

30:37.377 --> 30:38.913
What is it?

30:42.549 --> 30:45.041
You hear that? There it is again.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.549
I don't hear anything.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.718
A piping plover.

30:52.309 --> 30:57.145
Their breeding grounds are along
coastal beaches and alkali marshes...

30:57.314 --> 31:03.777
...so to hear that bell-like call
from a shorebird this far inland...

31:03.945 --> 31:06.813
My gosh. Poor little fella must be lost.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.856
You want to talk birds or guns?

31:13.747 --> 31:15.238
Impressive.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.281
Not if you're a lonely little plover.

31:17.459 --> 31:21.043
The other five crates are in the jet.
.50 caliber and 3Gs, as discussed.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.876
Dembe, if you could grab
Mr. Buhari's payment.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.415
Levi, you look fit.

31:25.592 --> 31:29.586
You can help me
load the merchandise.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.472
Adika, what have you done?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.511
ATF.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.642
- ATF. Get on the ground.
- Hands.

31:40.816 --> 31:41.977
I said hands.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.516
Get on the ground.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.900
Nice work, chief.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.543
Nice ride.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.882
Guy I was helping out.
It belongs to him.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.009
Okay. Why you driving it?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.922
Turns out he killed a guy.
Stuck him in the trunk.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.465
I'm dumping the body for him.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.554
Officer Serry won't talk.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.219
Aram told me
the Waterday CEO is dead...

32:20.397 --> 32:22.229
...but likely he had an accomplice.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.436
Who for all we know
is soliciting more cops.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.443
If we get to Serry,
we might be able put an end to this.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.399
- Mind if I take a run at her?
- Why not?

32:29.573 --> 32:30.905
One crooked cop to the next.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.236
Maybe you can bond
over the body in your trunk.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.992
There's a body in the trunk?

32:35.162 --> 32:36.869
Hurry up before it gets ripe.

32:37.038 --> 32:40.031
I told her I wanted a lawyer.
I'm not answering any questions.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.711
A Mongolian peasant...

32:45.881 --> 32:48.999
...gets brought into an office
where an important man offers him...

32:49.176 --> 32:51.418
...a million dollars on one condition:

32:51.595 --> 32:54.713
that he press the red button
on his desk.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.633
He tells the poor man
that if he presses the button...

32:57.809 --> 33:00.768
...an old man in Mongolia drops dead.

33:00.937 --> 33:04.772
He won't tell him why, only that
his death is good for the people.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.931
So...

33:06.401 --> 33:09.394
...he pushes the button,
takes the money and goes home.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.358
But he's haunted by what he did.

33:11.531 --> 33:16.117
He can't spend any of the money,
and eventually, he commits suicide.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.945
A man recently told me that story.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.660
Said we all have a Mongolian peasant
in our lives:

33:21.833 --> 33:23.995
Something we've done
that we're ashamed of...

33:24.169 --> 33:27.333
...and that the minute someone
finds out what that is...

33:27.506 --> 33:30.670
...he can make you do anything,
say anything, confess to anything...

33:30.842 --> 33:33.300
...either to cover it up...

33:34.304 --> 33:35.715
...or to atone.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.392
She said the target was sick.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.847
- "She." Your contact was a woman?
- That he didn't have long to live.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.438
That if I did it, I'd have money
to care of my sister.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.610
So I pushed the red button.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.364
Do you have a name?
Some way to contact her?

33:59.371 --> 34:01.033
- Yes?
<i>- I didn't do it.</i>

34:01.498 --> 34:02.659
We had an agreement.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.619
I know. I just...

34:05.544 --> 34:07.456
- I couldn't.
<i>- Couldn't or wouldn't?</i>

34:07.629 --> 34:09.120
<i>You know what?</i>

34:09.297 --> 34:10.708
<i>There's still time.</i>

34:10.882 --> 34:13.043
<i>I'm just not comfortable
talking on the phone.</i>

34:13.217 --> 34:14.379
<i>Can we meet somewhere?</i>

34:14.553 --> 34:16.340
You wanna meet?

34:16.513 --> 34:18.129
Okay.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.759
Where?

34:21.893 --> 34:26.103
I told Liz that I didn't wanna
do this, that I wanted no part of it...

34:26.273 --> 34:28.981
...but she insisted
that we work things out.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.771
Women.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.982
And now we're going to prison.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.739
I am going away to prison
because of you.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.447
The only saving grace
is you'll be even further away...

34:40.620 --> 34:43.033
...buried in the hold of a ship
in the Indian Ocean.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.697
Liz will finally be rid of you.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.788
And here I was thinking
she had finally made peace with me.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.248
She had...

34:50.964 --> 34:57.336
...because she's kind and decent,
and she sees the best in people.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.797
Even when she's being lied to.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.723
You're living proof of that.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.475
I'm an open book compared to you.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.978
You swear you never lie to her,
but I know better.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.639
- Do you, now?
- Yeah.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.933
I do.

35:28.335 --> 35:29.325
It's her.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.415
SWAT commander, target is on site.
We move on my go.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.933
Bulletproof glass.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.904
Good to see you again, Miss Thrall.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.337
If you're gonna lock me up
with someone...

36:15.507 --> 36:19.296
...perhaps it could be a redhead
with a nice smile and friendly demeanor.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.882
- Who the hell's this guy?
- Sorry it took so long.

36:22.055 --> 36:26.390
Once I knew Humberto had your African
friend and his chums in transpo...

36:26.559 --> 36:30.724
...I stopped for some Bengay ointment.
Think I overdid it with my back.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.265
- I use Epsom salt baths.
- These guys work for you?

36:37.821 --> 36:41.280
I thought that I was going to jail.
I was never gonna see my family again.

36:41.449 --> 36:44.157
You're telling me this whole thing
was about getting guns?

36:44.703 --> 36:45.910
Not just guns.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.241
A man needs to travel,
and when traveling...

36:48.415 --> 36:50.828
- ...I like to stretch.
- Buhari could've killed me...

36:51.000 --> 36:53.242
- ...if this went wrong.
- If I wanted you gone...

36:53.420 --> 36:57.334
...I'd put the bullet in your head myself.
However, you're important to Elizabeth...

36:57.507 --> 37:00.124
...so like it or not,
you're important to me.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.128
There's a piping plover
out here somewhere.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.261
Have either of you heard it?

37:08.518 --> 37:10.885
I understand you stumbled your way
into a new jet.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.429
Yes. I can't wait to get airborne.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.644
This is the longest I've been
grounded in some time.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.902
But not to worry, Harold.
It's a two-for-one special this week:

37:20.071 --> 37:22.313
You not only get
Miss Rebecca Thrall...

37:22.490 --> 37:25.449
<i>...you also get that
despicable African gun-runner...</i>

37:25.618 --> 37:27.701
<i>...your agency's
been hunting for years.</i>

37:27.871 --> 37:32.286
I need you to arrange for him
to be taken into FBI custody...

37:32.459 --> 37:34.872
- ...directly from my people.
- You still have people?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.127
I make friends easily.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.880
And this gun-runner, Buhari.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.756
Did he happen to have any guns?

37:44.804 --> 37:46.136
<i>Not this time.</i>

37:47.056 --> 37:50.140
But we mustn't look
a gift horse in the mouth.

37:52.979 --> 37:57.269
I know he can be terrible sometimes,
but come on, elephants?

37:57.442 --> 37:59.058
That sounds, at least, amusing.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.319
Yeah, for him, maybe.
I was taken hostage.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.903
He could've gotten me killed.
I cannot believe you're related to him...

38:06.075 --> 38:09.989
- ...because he's a nutjob.
- Nutjob or not, he is my father.

38:10.163 --> 38:14.578
And I appreciate you offering to help him.
It means the world to me.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.076
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.210
Okay, they need me.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.372
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

38:23.426 --> 38:24.507
Nik.

38:24.677 --> 38:25.838
McGee just called.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.425
Said he was able
to extract DNA from a tooth.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.385
Oh, that's great Nik.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.475
Thank you.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.185
Look, just...

38:39.359 --> 38:41.521
...let me know the minute
you know more.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.799
You know, Donald,
before I turned myself in to the FBI...

39:04.968 --> 39:08.837
...I held people like you
in extremely low regard.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.763
Right back at you.

39:11.933 --> 39:16.803
But I've found your determination
to do the right thing...

39:16.980 --> 39:21.190
...your genuine commitment
to the thin blue line...

39:21.359 --> 39:26.571
...that separates order and innocence
from the likes of me...

39:26.739 --> 39:30.198
...to be quite admirable.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.526
Why are you telling me this?

39:32.996 --> 39:36.410
I want you to know
you can count on me...

39:37.083 --> 39:40.497
...if you ever find yourself
in as difficult a position...

39:40.670 --> 39:43.378
...as Officer McGinnis
has put himself in.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.792
Never gonna happen.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.590
Nevertheless, my offer stands...

39:55.560 --> 39:58.553
...for the day I hope will never come.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.905
Who was he?

40:18.082 --> 40:19.118
Who was who?

40:19.292 --> 40:21.409
All you did was get a car
out of impound.

40:21.586 --> 40:24.579
And you'll be getting
your next assignment real soon.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.898
She's a nice plane, Raymond.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.734
No fuel and no pilot,
but a plane of our own.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.830
I like it out here.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.911
It's peaceful.

41:03.378 --> 41:08.373
I'm telling you, the mosquitos out here
are the size of birds.

41:11.511 --> 41:14.675
Glen, you came for your money,
which has been returned in full...

41:15.306 --> 41:18.765
...and while I'm deeply grateful
for what you've done...

41:18.935 --> 41:20.767
...you're perfectly welcome to go.

41:20.937 --> 41:24.851
No, I know what it's like
to feel alone, partner.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.560
Dembe?

41:30.279 --> 41:32.487
- Want another dog?
- No, thank you.

41:32.657 --> 41:37.072
Well, I don't mind if I do.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.537
Excuse me.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.919
That's right. Mosquitos or not...

41:47.088 --> 41:51.799
...I'm afraid we'll be sleeping with
the door to the jet open tonight, boys.
