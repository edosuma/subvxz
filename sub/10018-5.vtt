WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:09.043
Previously on E.R.

00:10.317 --> 00:12.742
I am behind Kerry 100 percent.

00:12.777 --> 00:14.837
If you disagree with anything
she's doing...

00:14.838 --> 00:17.016
...assume that she's acting
with my approval.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.512
Shall we wait till someone dies?

00:20.680 --> 00:22.785
A dislocation in the interphalangeal joint.

00:23.061 --> 00:24.686
He may have a gun, you guys!

00:24.960 --> 00:29.364
It's my fault he has AIDS.
I gave it to him.

00:29.599 --> 00:33.175
- I was thinking of adopting Susie.
- Oh. Okay.

00:33.210 --> 00:37.237
- You're not a mother, are you?
- No, I'm not.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.111
"And Baby makes two"

00:44.702 --> 00:47.237
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:47.618 --> 00:49.609
We alone?

00:49.785 --> 00:51.693
I'm alone. Are you?

00:51.869 --> 00:54.274
I thought I heard a woman's voice
during the night.

00:54.452 --> 00:58.908
- You eavesdropping?
- Just, you know, kind of hard to miss.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.107
Didn't sound like Hulda.

01:02.702 --> 01:04.989
- Want a bagel?
- Fresh?

01:05.160 --> 01:08.277
Baked this morning by elfin hands.

01:08.452 --> 01:11.616
Works all day, entertains all night...

01:11.786 --> 01:14.404
...and he gets up at sunrise
and goes to the bakery.

01:14.577 --> 01:16.153
What's your secret?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.151
I'm a virtuous man.

01:20.786 --> 01:23.700
- Good morning, Jer.
- And a delightful morning to you.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.486
- Fresh buttered popcorn?
- I'm watching my triglycerides.

01:27.577 --> 01:31.274
- Turfed the slip-and-fall to Ortho.
- Well done. Popcorn?

01:31.453 --> 01:35.032
Hello, all. Isn't it a wonderful day?

01:36.619 --> 01:38.077
Good morning. ER.

01:38.453 --> 01:42.363
- Are the nitrous tanks leaking again?
- Better. It's Weaver's day off.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.902
And if that's not cause for celebration,
I don't know what is.

01:49.286 --> 01:50.613
Perfect.

01:50.703 --> 01:52.610
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

01:52.703 --> 01:54.575
You guys are bad.

01:57.661 --> 01:59.948
Turn it up.

02:05.953 --> 02:08.442
- Hey. Just getting on?
- Yeah. You?

02:08.620 --> 02:10.491
No. No, I spent all night in the O.R.

02:10.662 --> 02:12.984
Woman with a bowel obstruction
crashed. Big mess.

02:13.412 --> 02:15.651
And I floated
my first Swan-Ganz catheter.

02:15.828 --> 02:18.281
You've done a lot of procedures lately.

02:18.453 --> 02:20.740
Yeah. Cutdowns, chest tubes...

02:20.912 --> 02:23.447
...opened a choley, closed an appy.

02:23.537 --> 02:26.404
Benton's bum finger's the best thing
that happened to me.

02:26.495 --> 02:28.201
I even got to staple a stomach.

02:28.287 --> 02:32.067
Benton had to stand there and watch.
The look on his face was classic.

02:32.370 --> 02:35.368
- Just...
- Carter.

02:35.662 --> 02:37.783
I have a new procedure for you.

02:37.954 --> 02:39.577
Foreign body extraction.

02:39.745 --> 02:43.241
- What kind of foreign body?
- Flashlight.

02:43.370 --> 02:46.487
Claims he fell on it
while changing a fuse.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.743
Naked.

02:48.912 --> 02:53.616
Adoption proceedings can't begin
until 90 days after abandonment.

02:53.787 --> 02:55.280
So assuming we proceed...

02:55.454 --> 02:59.779
...the Hallorans would petition
for custody in early January.

03:01.787 --> 03:05.911
However, they would like
to take Susie sooner than later.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.574
- How much sooner?
- End of the week.

03:10.621 --> 03:14.282
They feel the change would be less
traumatic now than in a month or two.

03:14.454 --> 03:16.326
Right.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.743
I mentioned your wish to continue
to be part of Susie's life...

03:19.829 --> 03:24.119
...as her aunt, and they are willing
to think about it.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.994
Right.

03:29.246 --> 03:31.237
Yes.

03:31.871 --> 03:33.909
I'll come out.

03:35.955 --> 03:39.486
They're nice people, but there's no
reason to feel you have to comply...

03:39.663 --> 03:42.198
...with their timetable and conditions.

03:42.496 --> 03:45.163
You need to feel comfortable
with the arrangement.

03:46.788 --> 03:48.032
I know.

03:48.205 --> 03:51.073
And you should take
all the time you need.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.247
I don't think time will make it any easier.

03:57.413 --> 03:58.871
Ready?

04:00.955 --> 04:04.285
- Oh, what are their first names?
- Kevin and Lisa.

04:11.664 --> 04:13.654
Lisa, Kevin.

04:16.414 --> 04:18.451
I'm so excited.

04:20.204 --> 04:22.113
I'd like you to meet Susan Lewis.

04:25.289 --> 04:27.030
Hello.

04:27.122 --> 04:28.698
Nice to meet you, Susan.

04:28.789 --> 04:31.740
This is Susie. So beautiful.

04:32.414 --> 04:33.788
Thank you.

04:38.664 --> 04:43.654
- Do you want to hold her?
- Oh, yes.

04:44.622 --> 04:45.996
Yes.

04:47.247 --> 04:50.743
You are so precious.

04:52.373 --> 04:54.826
So precious.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.074

05:48.903 --> 05:51.108
Not my shift, not my shift.

05:51.278 --> 05:53.270
Why are these old charts still here?

05:53.655 --> 05:57.067
- Dr. Weaver usually weeds them out.
- You can tell when she's not here.

05:57.238 --> 05:58.814
- Yeah.
- Where's Susan?

05:58.988 --> 06:00.861
She took a personal day.

06:01.031 --> 06:04.112
Let there be no doubt.
Flu season has arrived...

06:04.281 --> 06:05.773
...I have half the board.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.567
- One more. Chia-Chia Loew.
- Oh, yeah, let me see that.

06:08.740 --> 06:11.110
- Little boy with AIDS?
- Yep, he spiked a fever.

06:11.282 --> 06:13.985
He can't sit up. I put him in 3.

06:14.116 --> 06:17.150
- Kid in 2's done.
- You get the french fry out of his nose?

06:17.241 --> 06:21.366
I listened to his mother for 20 minutes.
I'll be glad when I go back to Surgery.

06:21.534 --> 06:25.907
Look at the bright side. You've a chance
to perfect your bedside manner.

06:26.076 --> 06:28.612
- Here's another.
- Great.

06:28.868 --> 06:32.151
All yesterday he is in bed throwing up.

06:32.952 --> 06:34.778
He stopped talking.

06:35.745 --> 06:40.071
The first thing we need to do is bring
his fever down and stop the vomiting.

06:40.329 --> 06:42.699
In order to know the right medicine
to give him...

06:42.871 --> 06:45.489
...we're gonna have to do
a lumbar puncture.

06:45.662 --> 06:48.069
It's where we take fluid
from around his spine...

06:48.163 --> 06:51.494
...and test it to see what's wrong.
That's what we're gonna do, okay?

06:51.663 --> 06:54.865
Yes. You make him well?

06:55.623 --> 06:58.194
Well, we can't cure the AIDS,
you know that...

06:58.373 --> 07:00.862
...but we'll do what we can
to make him feel better.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.782
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.617
Chia-Chia.

07:13.333 --> 07:17.542
It's a piercing sort of pain,
like a spike through the temple.

07:18.501 --> 07:21.335
- How long have you had migraines?
- All my life.

07:21.502 --> 07:23.410
- Do you get them?
- No.

07:23.586 --> 07:24.865
- You?
- No.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.453
Count your blessings.

07:26.627 --> 07:28.998
I'll ask the doctor
about giving you some Imitrex.

07:29.170 --> 07:32.002
Oh, I had that once. Gave me chest pain.

07:32.503 --> 07:35.171
- Okay. In that case, Toradol?
- Can't.

07:35.338 --> 07:36.961
It gives me hives.

07:37.921 --> 07:41.501
But they gave me something here
that worked wonders.

07:42.381 --> 07:44.170
It began with a D.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.330
- What was it?
- Demerol?

07:46.839 --> 07:48.630
That's it.

07:49.632 --> 07:51.373
Okay.

07:52.632 --> 07:54.290
We'll be right back.

07:55.091 --> 07:56.916
- She's sweet.
- She's a junkie.

07:57.091 --> 07:58.833
- What?
- It's a snow job.

07:59.008 --> 08:01.579
She's faking migraines to get a quick fix.

08:01.759 --> 08:03.003
How can you tell?

08:03.176 --> 08:06.506
You learn to smell them.
Have you ever seen the turkey file?

08:07.342 --> 08:09.464
Hey, Dr. Benton. Still works.

08:10.843 --> 08:12.668
Just kidding. Different flashlight.

08:12.843 --> 08:15.677
I thought that splint was supposed
to stay on till tomorrow.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.790
- You got that circled on your calendar?
- I handled a lot of dislocations in Ortho.

08:19.928 --> 08:22.713
- Not interested.
- You're risking permanent joint laxity.

08:22.804 --> 08:24.083
- Osteoarthritis.
- Goodbye.

08:24.262 --> 08:27.344
- Tendinitis.
- Dr. B, got a lady here, beat up bad.

08:27.512 --> 08:29.303
- Can you hear me, hon?
- What happened?

08:29.388 --> 08:31.758
Anonymous call.
Found her on the floor at home.

08:31.847 --> 08:34.251
Multiple contusions,
bruises to the face and chest.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.216
- Conscious but unresponsive.
- Okay, lift her on my count.

08:37.306 --> 08:40.837
Nice and easy. Here we go.
One, two, three.

08:41.765 --> 08:44.089
- Do we have a name?
- ID says Vickie Mazovick.

08:44.182 --> 08:47.346
Vickie, squeeze my hand.

08:47.432 --> 08:49.590
- No blood in the canal.
- Negative Babinski.

08:49.683 --> 08:51.674
- What's wrong with her?
- May be psychotic.

08:52.058 --> 08:55.010
Vickie, talk to me.
Tell me, who did this to you?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.805
All right, can you feel this?

08:58.143 --> 09:00.015
- Responds to pain.
- Leave me alone!

09:00.101 --> 09:02.092
- Damn!
- Should have kept your splint on.

09:02.185 --> 09:05.847
- Extensive bruising to the ribs.
- Get X-ray. Carter, how's her chest?

09:06.019 --> 09:09.183
- Good bilateral breath sounds.
- She's crying.

09:09.352 --> 09:10.894
It's a good sign, I guess.

09:11.687 --> 09:15.633
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

09:16.104 --> 09:17.597
Damn!

09:17.980 --> 09:20.184
- What was her last name again?
- Krupke.

09:20.355 --> 09:22.843
Krupke. Krupke.

09:23.439 --> 09:26.106
"Krupke, Lottie.
Also known as Kamen, Laura.

09:26.272 --> 09:29.021
Also known as Kimball, Myrna. "

09:29.189 --> 09:33.054
"Addicted to narcotics, alcoholic,
bipolar. " God, this is sad.

09:33.232 --> 09:36.064
What's sad is when they con you
out of five or six doses...

09:36.232 --> 09:39.147
...before you catch on.
Then you really feel like a chump.

09:39.316 --> 09:40.690
Nurse Hathaway?

09:41.191 --> 09:42.850
Carol.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.557
E. Ray Bozman. I'm your nurse trainee.

09:45.651 --> 09:46.930
Oh, yes, right. Come on in.

09:47.026 --> 09:49.597
Grab a lab coat.
I'll be with you in a sec.

09:49.692 --> 09:53.687
Mark, I gotta do an LP on a 4-year-old.
I could use a hand.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.060
- Harper, you ever see an LP?
- No, but I'd like to.

09:57.235 --> 10:00.353
I don't really wanna babysit
a med student right now.

10:00.528 --> 10:05.103
Well, it's either Harper or the guy
wearing Morgenstern's lab coat.

10:06.279 --> 10:08.186
Harper, let's do it.

10:10.154 --> 10:14.279
Yeah. They seemed like nice people,
didn't they?

10:14.530 --> 10:17.611
Yeah? Smart, funny.

10:17.781 --> 10:20.614
Not so perfect they're obnoxious.

10:20.781 --> 10:23.186
And they have a little boy.

10:23.365 --> 10:26.980
Yeah. You could have a big brother.

10:28.116 --> 10:31.648
Someone to look out for you...

10:31.867 --> 10:34.023
...teach you stuff.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.156
Susie...

10:39.201 --> 10:40.991
...this is so hard.

10:42.493 --> 10:45.362
I just don't think I'd be
a good enough mother.

10:46.369 --> 10:49.865
We have ways of screwing kids up
in my family.

10:50.869 --> 10:53.275
I just want you to be happy.

10:55.953 --> 10:57.530
I love you.

10:57.704 --> 10:59.245
You know that?

11:00.455 --> 11:01.864
I do.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.281
Oh, God.

11:07.456 --> 11:10.205
- Orbit's okay. No fracture.
- She's got a cracked rib.

11:10.289 --> 11:14.035
Two cracked ribs, two healed fractures,
old shoulder fracture, humerus.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.328
Hey, you put your splint on. Wise choice.

11:16.957 --> 11:18.663
- She said anything yet?
- No.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.989
Actually, she told me she wanted
to go home.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.327
Not a good idea.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.245
She's been here three times before.
First time, she said it was her husband...

11:26.334 --> 11:29.001
- ... but wouldn't press charges.
- And the other times?

11:29.084 --> 11:32.532
- Said she fell down the stairs.
- All right, call the social worker.

11:32.710 --> 11:36.325
Give her some Vicodin for the pain
and tell her to see her doctor.

11:36.502 --> 11:39.703
- You're not going to talk to her?
- Not my job.

11:44.128 --> 11:46.700
All right, kiddo. Let's get started.

11:46.879 --> 11:50.327
- Okay, here we go, let's get going.
- Hi, Chia-Chia.

11:51.046 --> 11:53.203
Hold onto the back of his thighs.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.746
With your other hand, you hold
onto the back of his neck. Lean over.

11:58.089 --> 11:59.581
Hold on tight.

12:00.048 --> 12:01.457
No, no.

12:01.631 --> 12:05.495
Buddy, your mom tells me you like
to play with the neighbor's dog.

12:06.048 --> 12:07.423
It's okay.

12:07.632 --> 12:11.128
- No. No. No.
- You have to hold him tight.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.832
That's just to numb it.
The next one won't be so bad.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.882
Now, when I was a kid...

12:35.762 --> 12:38.713
- ... I had a dog named Louie.
- No. No.

12:38.887 --> 12:41.590
- No, Mama.
- Louie the dog.

12:48.222 --> 12:50.012
You're doing great.

12:51.556 --> 12:54.009
Okay, there we go.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.715
Doing great.

13:00.390 --> 13:03.887
- He stopped moving.
- Yeah.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.008
He surrendered.

13:11.851 --> 13:13.640
Just a little more.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.892
Not much longer.

13:19.754 --> 13:23.287
Jerry. If anybody calls for me,
I'll be up in the O.R. with Dr. Hicks.

13:23.464 --> 13:25.171
Okay.

13:26.799 --> 13:28.626
Is it lighter in here? They repaint?

13:28.801 --> 13:32.002
The Weaver has lifted. Cake?

13:32.177 --> 13:35.047
Sure. Subtle.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.638
- What's going on?
- Birthday party.

13:38.807 --> 13:40.429
Oh, yeah? Whose birthday?

13:40.598 --> 13:44.097
- Bob's.
- Bob's not working today.

13:44.268 --> 13:46.509
Well, it's still her birthday.

13:46.686 --> 13:48.477
In that case, how about a piece?

13:48.646 --> 13:51.598
Sorry, it's all gone.

13:53.981 --> 13:56.554
- Hey there.
- Man, was that no fun.

13:56.733 --> 13:59.057
- What?
- LP on a little kid.

13:59.235 --> 14:02.519
Always rough. I'm on my way
to resect a bowel.

14:02.695 --> 14:04.354
Wanna get some lunch after that?

14:04.529 --> 14:07.232
- Sorry, I gotta ride herd on this kid.
- How about dinner?

14:07.405 --> 14:08.734
- Possibly.
- Possibly.

14:08.907 --> 14:11.479
- Probably.
- Possibly.

14:11.825 --> 14:13.484
Carter. You and Harper?

14:13.659 --> 14:16.659
Something extracurricular
happening there?

14:17.828 --> 14:21.030
- Dr. Greene.
- Loretta. How have you been?

14:21.205 --> 14:23.115
Lousy. Threw my back out.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.661
- How?
- At work.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.824
Jerry, can you start a chart? Lydia?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.660
- Coming.
- Come on.

14:29.919 --> 14:32.752
So this is, like, a midlife
career shift for you?

14:32.921 --> 14:34.295
Yeah, I tend to shift a lot.

14:34.462 --> 14:37.961
I've been a UPS delivery-man,
a short-order cook, a rodeo clown.

14:38.132 --> 14:41.581
And then in the mid-'80s, I got into
the Human Potential Movement.

14:41.758 --> 14:45.589
- Doing what?
- Lectures, inspirational speeches.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.002
I'm a nurturer. I like helping people.

14:48.179 --> 14:52.091
So nursing seemed like the next
logical step in my life progression.

14:52.264 --> 14:55.679
Okay, Mr. Keller.
You take a seat right here.

14:56.559 --> 14:58.930
There you go. Great.

14:59.018 --> 15:01.852
I want you to shave his head,
clean, irrigate the wound.

15:01.936 --> 15:04.391
I'll start a chart and get a doctor
to stitch him.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.271
- Okey-dokey.
- Dr. Ross...

15:06.356 --> 15:08.394
...I picked up Chia-Chia's lab results.

15:08.482 --> 15:12.181
Did a cell count, differential, protein,
glucose, Gram's stain and culture...

15:12.276 --> 15:14.943
...but they ran out of fluid
for the India ink stain.

15:15.027 --> 15:16.106
I don't believe it.

15:16.278 --> 15:19.029
- Is that the test for meningitis?
- Yes, yes.

15:19.196 --> 15:22.480
Okay, tell me if this hurts.
Keep your leg straight.

15:22.657 --> 15:23.902
It's okay.

15:24.075 --> 15:27.572
I don't see any sign of a slipped disc.
Just a muscle strain.

15:27.743 --> 15:30.234
- You need to stay off your feet.
- No problem.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.079
I mean bed rest, Loretta,
emphasis on "rest. "

15:33.246 --> 15:35.487
Gotcha.

15:35.664 --> 15:37.241
It still hurts like hell, though.

15:37.416 --> 15:40.699
- Can we give her something?
- I'll write a prescription for Feldene.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.709
That ought to do the trick.

15:43.127 --> 15:46.375
Dr. Greene, Dr. Lewis is here to see you.

15:46.587 --> 15:49.503
Loretta, take care.

15:54.549 --> 15:56.422
Figures this would happen today.

15:56.592 --> 15:59.426
- I was supposed to have a job interview.
- Really?

15:59.594 --> 16:03.175
Yeah. Answering phones for a place
that makes clothes and stuff.

16:03.346 --> 16:06.382
- The social worker put me up to it.
- Sounds like a good job.

16:07.308 --> 16:09.049
I never get these things, though.

16:09.224 --> 16:11.431
They take one look at me,
they know the score.

16:12.477 --> 16:16.307
I wonder how. We have a closet
full of clothes here.

16:16.478 --> 16:19.395
- You could see if there's anything.
- Why do you got clothes?

16:19.480 --> 16:21.721
- Whoever needs them.
- Where do you get them?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.605
- Dead people.
- You gotta be kidding.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.190
There's some nice stuff.
We get some pretty rich dead people.

16:29.528 --> 16:33.110
Okay. We need to do another
lumbar puncture on Chia-Chia.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.983
- Another?
- I'm sorry. If there were any other way...

16:36.156 --> 16:37.567
...I would do it.

16:37.741 --> 16:40.409
This is gonna be a small amount,
not as much as before.

16:40.993 --> 16:42.451
Okay?

16:52.542 --> 16:54.165
I'm sorry.

17:06.007 --> 17:09.624
I met with a lawyer today
about putting Susie up for adoption.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.208
Really? Is it definite?

17:12.720 --> 17:16.798
Before I make my final decision, I need
to know what my options are at work.

17:16.972 --> 17:21.217
If I keep her, there's no way I could
continue to do my residency full-time.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.678
Could I do it part-time?

17:23.767 --> 17:27.051
- I'll look into it. Heard from Chloe?
- No.

17:27.228 --> 17:29.718
It's been nuts here.
Do you want to get some coffee?

17:29.896 --> 17:33.429
No, Mark, I don't. I need to know
if a part-time schedule is doable.

17:33.606 --> 17:36.559
- I've only heard of that in Pediatrics.
- So it's not.

17:36.733 --> 17:40.432
I'll talk to Morgenstern,
see if we can work something out.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.772
I appreciate it.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.275
You beep me out of surgery
to sew up a drunk?

17:44.362 --> 17:47.279
- Benton said you like doing procedures.
- Very funny.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.397
- Oh, my God.
- Almost done.

17:52.075 --> 17:56.236
E. Ray, why did you shave his
entire head for a 4-centimeter lac?

17:56.411 --> 17:58.117
We've been talking about...

17:58.203 --> 18:00.693
...how to effect positive change
in one's life...

18:00.788 --> 18:04.831
...and how changing the physical
can be a symbolic first step...

18:04.999 --> 18:06.956
...in transforming the inner self.

18:09.168 --> 18:12.617
Are you Benton?
McGillis, Social Services.

18:12.794 --> 18:16.245
I'm confused about your chart notes
on Vickie Mazovick...

18:16.422 --> 18:18.330
...the woman who got beat up.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.913
You didn't note if she had
hand and arm injuries.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.130
- She didn't.
- Could you note that, please?

18:23.301 --> 18:24.759
It could be significant.

18:24.927 --> 18:27.417
If it was significant,
I would have written it down.

18:28.971 --> 18:33.215
It suggests she didn't defend herself,
which suggests she's given up...

18:33.389 --> 18:36.011
...which means, statistically,
she's reached a stage...

18:36.184 --> 18:39.017
...where she's in danger
of being killed.

18:46.314 --> 18:49.231
You didn't note what she said
when you asked what happened.

18:49.316 --> 18:51.806
- I didn't ask what happened.
- Did you suspect abuse?

18:51.984 --> 18:55.434
- Of course I did. I saw the chart.
- Then you're supposed to ask.

18:55.611 --> 18:58.100
- So, what did she tell you?
- Nothing.

18:58.279 --> 19:01.114
So, what makes you think
she's gonna tell me anything?

19:01.281 --> 19:04.115
It's worth a try, don't you think?

19:07.117 --> 19:09.275
Oh, this would look good on you.

19:10.912 --> 19:12.949
Maybe not.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.278
It doesn't really quite fit.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.448
What do you mean? It looks great!

19:19.624 --> 19:22.115
- Do you think so?
- Oh, yeah.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.458
It needs something.

19:25.753 --> 19:27.625
You see some stuff working here, I bet.

19:27.795 --> 19:31.045
- Like you don't?
- My clients don't die on me.

19:31.215 --> 19:33.041
Except for that one guy.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.299
That's it.

19:45.681 --> 19:47.222
You think so?

19:49.683 --> 19:52.173
- You're doing another LP?
- Lab forgot an India ink.

19:52.268 --> 19:54.722
I'll tap out a couple cc's
and do the test myself.

19:54.810 --> 19:57.348
- How's he holding up?
- Not well.

20:00.188 --> 20:03.143
This is gonna be quick.
It's only gonna take a few minutes.

20:10.987 --> 20:13.311
Hi, Chia-Chia. How's it going?

20:13.488 --> 20:15.646
Get him over on his side.

20:19.825 --> 20:21.402
Mrs. Mazovick?

20:23.119 --> 20:26.616
I'm Dr. Benton. I need to ask you
a few questions about how you got hurt.

20:26.787 --> 20:28.660
I fell.

20:28.997 --> 20:32.945
- There are people that can help you.
- I don't want any help.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.077
Okay.

20:37.878 --> 20:40.332
I'm still gonna have to report it
to the police.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.709
Won't do any good.

20:55.512 --> 20:57.801
Three drops in there.

20:59.264 --> 21:01.505
And a drop of ink.

21:04.976 --> 21:06.683
Then...

21:06.852 --> 21:09.686
...you slide it under the microscope.

21:11.438 --> 21:15.019
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

21:16.065 --> 21:18.520
You did really well in there.

21:18.692 --> 21:21.691
Better the second time than the first.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.732
- Does it get easier?
- No.

21:24.904 --> 21:26.362
Wait. Catch that light.

21:28.531 --> 21:30.736
I thought Pediatrics
was the happy specialty.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.982
Most of the time.

21:33.534 --> 21:36.947
Okay. Here you go. What do you see?

21:40.038 --> 21:43.867
Yeast cells,
some large capsules around them.

21:44.039 --> 21:46.197
Cryptococcus.

21:46.583 --> 21:49.417
- He has cryptococcal meningitis?
- Yeah.

21:49.585 --> 21:52.040
He's getting near the end.

21:59.591 --> 22:03.040
I need somebody to call the police
for a suspected domestic abuse case.

22:03.133 --> 22:04.378
You got it.

22:04.551 --> 22:05.962
Carter, where are you going?

22:06.136 --> 22:11.044
Morgenstern's doing a hemicolectomy.
He asked me to make the incision.

22:11.221 --> 22:14.803
Not today. A guy in 6 cut his finger.

22:15.474 --> 22:17.845
- Please! Please, I need help!
- Get a gurney!

22:17.933 --> 22:19.309
- You'll need help.
- Got it.

22:19.394 --> 22:21.266
- What if you need a cutdown?
- Got it.

22:21.352 --> 22:23.059
- Where are you hurt?
- It's not me.

22:23.228 --> 22:25.303
It's my husband. He's in the car.

22:25.730 --> 22:27.887
- What happened?
- He was on his motorcycle...

22:28.065 --> 22:30.980
...outside our apartment
and a truck hit him and took off.

22:31.149 --> 22:32.809
All right, let's get him out.

22:33.193 --> 22:35.314
- Come on.
- Oh, man, that's a lot of blood.

22:35.485 --> 22:38.057
- Is he dead?
- No, he's still breathing.

22:38.153 --> 22:41.355
I tried to get him here as fast as I could.
I ran red lights.

22:41.448 --> 22:44.400
- You did the right thing.
- He's gonna need at least six units.

22:44.574 --> 22:48.107
- Wait a minute. Where's his arm?
- It's in the back seat!

22:49.244 --> 22:51.531
Oh, my God.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.942
- It is the same thing he had before?
- Yes. He's...

22:56.706 --> 23:00.074
He's had a relapse. He's very sick.

23:00.250 --> 23:03.083
The best way to treat him now...

23:03.251 --> 23:07.579
...is to give him a high concentration
of medication intrathecally.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.999
Which means...?

23:09.172 --> 23:12.419
It means that we're gonna do
the same procedure as the spinal tap...

23:12.589 --> 23:14.914
...but in reverse.

23:15.091 --> 23:16.371
Again?

23:16.551 --> 23:20.926
It's the only way to get
a high enough dose of the medication.

23:21.845 --> 23:23.468
One more time.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.261
No. It has to be a full course.

23:27.432 --> 23:29.222
That means two times a day...

23:29.891 --> 23:31.930
...for 10 days.

23:32.392 --> 23:35.725
We'll admit him into the hospital.
We'll put a catheter in his back.

23:35.811 --> 23:38.894
That way he won't have to have
the puncture each time.

23:41.773 --> 23:44.441
It will stop the vomiting and the fever?

23:44.858 --> 23:47.146
If he responds to the medication, yes.

23:47.235 --> 23:49.724
Once his body has fought off
the meningitis...

23:49.819 --> 23:53.020
...it'll be able to work harder
against the AIDS.

24:03.952 --> 24:07.651
If you think this is the best thing
for Chia-Chia.

24:07.829 --> 24:10.117
I do. Yes.

24:14.334 --> 24:17.866
I work at Daley Plaza and my wife
works at the Merchandise Mart...

24:18.043 --> 24:21.956
...so we got together for a picnic lunch
by the fountain at lunch hour.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.588
- Sounds nice.
- It was...

24:23.755 --> 24:27.288
...until I decided to cut the French bread
with my Swiss Army knife.

24:27.465 --> 24:31.047
I knew I should have gotten soft crust.

24:32.176 --> 24:35.841
- How long have you had that mole?
- Oh, a while.

24:36.013 --> 24:38.549
It actually looks a little bigger
than last time.

24:38.639 --> 24:41.639
I you want, I can excise it
and run a test, just to be safe.

24:41.724 --> 24:46.763
- What does that involve?
- An anesthetic, surgically remove it.

24:47.309 --> 24:48.888
- All right.
- Yeah? Great.

24:49.062 --> 24:53.602
I'll just run it past the Attending
and I will be right back.

24:54.897 --> 24:56.475
Yes.

24:59.317 --> 25:02.400
- Three units O-neg. Put it on the infuser.
- He's still bleeding.

25:02.694 --> 25:05.445
- Inflate the BP cuff to 150.
- What's going on, Peter?

25:05.737 --> 25:07.859
Hit-and-run amputation.
He's hypovolemic.

25:08.030 --> 25:10.236
- Where's the arm?
- Wrapped and on ice.

25:10.407 --> 25:13.774
Get a vascular surgeon down here.
Call the Reimplantation Team.

25:13.950 --> 25:16.322
- Get a pulse.
- He's bradying down.

25:16.494 --> 25:18.035
- Tube him.
- Not with this finger.

25:18.203 --> 25:20.325
- Two more units here.
- ET tray.

25:20.412 --> 25:24.574
- Atropine. One milligram, IV push.
- Number 8.

25:28.958 --> 25:31.081
- I got a pulse.
- BP's 50 palp.

25:31.252 --> 25:34.002
That's something.
Hang another two units O-neg.

25:34.211 --> 25:36.003
We'll move him as soon as he's tubed.

25:36.172 --> 25:38.578
All right, let's move him.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.751
Cookie. Door.

25:45.927 --> 25:48.677
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mom.

25:48.844 --> 25:50.469
- Do you have the baby?
- Yeah.

25:50.638 --> 25:52.677
Just a second.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.892
- Smile!
- Mom.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.685
You bought a video camera.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.352
If you're gonna be a grandma,
you may as well do it right.

26:09.689 --> 26:13.852
They cost a fortune.
No wonder there's a trade deficit.

26:14.026 --> 26:16.860
- Mom, would you do that later?
- Don't be such a grouch.

26:17.028 --> 26:19.233
- Hi.
- Turn around. Smile for Grandma.

26:19.404 --> 26:22.522
- I need to sit down.
- Sit. Give me the little termite.

26:22.697 --> 26:24.191
- Come on.
- Okay.

26:24.365 --> 26:29.071
- Yeah, there you go.
- Right over here. Look. Up, up, up.

26:31.578 --> 26:34.032
- I need to talk to you guys.
- Look.

26:34.245 --> 26:37.495
- Mom?
- Hi. Oh, she's so cute.

26:37.665 --> 26:38.909
Look at that.

26:39.082 --> 26:41.915
- Dad.
- I'm listening.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.949
I met with a lawyer today about...

26:45.336 --> 26:47.374
...giving Susie up for adoption.

26:47.878 --> 26:50.333
But she's not even your baby.

26:50.505 --> 26:54.168
Mom, Chloe is never coming back.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.009
Would you turn that thing off?

26:57.384 --> 27:00.088
I don't know how you could
even consider that.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.004
- You don't wanna give her away, do you?
- Of course I don't.

27:04.178 --> 27:06.751
- It kills me to even think about it.
- Then don't.

27:07.890 --> 27:10.842
How am I supposed to raise her alone
and finish my residency?

27:11.016 --> 27:13.304
People do these things all the time,
don't they?

27:13.476 --> 27:15.882
Dad, I work 12-hour shifts
five days a week.

27:15.977 --> 27:18.136
I won't put her in daycare for that long.

27:18.229 --> 27:20.517
There must be something you can do.

27:20.689 --> 27:23.641
Could you guys keep her
three days a week?

27:27.026 --> 27:29.267
Maybe we could do it.
Three days a week?

27:29.444 --> 27:33.653
Sure! We know what that means. I'll be
doing all the work, running her around.

27:33.821 --> 27:36.145
- I'm here.
- You haven't left this house in years.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.396
- You hardly leave that chair.
- I'm retired.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.731
- You make me sound like a nut.
- It's not normal.

27:40.908 --> 27:44.490
At least I don't drink all day.
Two vodka gimlets for breakfast.

27:44.785 --> 27:46.743
- Whose report is this?
- Finger lac in 6.

27:46.829 --> 27:49.319
- I saw a growth on his arm and tested it.
- Melanoma.

27:49.497 --> 27:52.413
Bingo. And I found
an axillary lymph node on exam.

27:52.582 --> 27:55.913
- It needs to be excised.
- I spoke to Pereira in Surgical Oncology.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.791
He agreed to let me do the biopsy.

27:57.959 --> 28:02.252
Peter, cop's in with Mrs. Mazovick,
in case you wanna talk to him.

28:02.754 --> 28:05.078
Right.

28:05.505 --> 28:07.747
- I just picked up an interesting case.
- Yeah?

28:07.924 --> 28:10.923
Yeah. I excised a mole on a 36-year-old
male. It's melanoma.

28:11.091 --> 28:13.416
I get to biopsy the lymph node.

28:13.594 --> 28:17.175
A 36-year-old has cancer
and you get to do the biopsy.

28:17.346 --> 28:20.630
Well, congratulations.

28:26.685 --> 28:30.727
I hope you have an easier time
convincing her to make a statement.

28:30.894 --> 28:32.721
- And who are you?
- I'm Dr. Benton.

28:32.896 --> 28:35.600
I was in charge of her case, Officer...

28:35.773 --> 28:37.681
Mazovick.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.356
Come on, babe, let's go.

28:43.110 --> 28:46.193
What goes through your head
when you're beating her?

28:49.489 --> 28:51.362
What a big man you are?

28:52.740 --> 28:54.982
Michael, please.

28:55.952 --> 28:57.528
Please.

29:01.913 --> 29:03.786
Your husband just went up to the O.R.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.622
They're trying to reattach his arm.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.281
- They can do that?
- Well, they can try.

29:09.459 --> 29:12.126
With complete amputation,
the success rate's small.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.535
We only have insurance left
for three days.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.869
I wouldn't worry about that.
They'll cover it.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.499
Jason lost his job three months ago,
benefits too.

29:19.589 --> 29:22.258
I'm a waitress. No benefits.

29:22.424 --> 29:27.249
- Is there somebody I can call for you?
- No. No, thanks.

29:27.844 --> 29:32.634
I keep having this weird thought that
Jason's dead and you're not telling me.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.797
- He isn't, is he?
- No.

29:34.973 --> 29:38.755
He's in the O.R.
You're just feeling the stress.

29:40.643 --> 29:42.302
Carrie?

29:42.477 --> 29:44.884
Would you like to come
and lie down in the lounge?

29:45.813 --> 29:48.647
No. No, thank you.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.847
How are you doing, Mr. Forchet?

29:54.025 --> 29:56.432
I'm starting to worry a little bit,
actually.

29:56.611 --> 29:58.104
Is something wrong?

29:58.278 --> 30:02.025
Dr. Carter, they said you might need
some help with a lymph node biopsy.

30:04.323 --> 30:06.231
A biopsy?

30:06.407 --> 30:07.984
- Do I have cancer?
- Mr. Forchet...

30:08.158 --> 30:11.656
...your mole was identified
as a malignant melanoma.

30:14.495 --> 30:17.697
- Oh, my God.
- The good news is that we caught it...

30:17.873 --> 30:19.864
...which means we can treat it
immediately.

30:20.624 --> 30:22.532
What's the worst-case scenario?

30:23.418 --> 30:25.076
There's no way to gauge that...

30:25.252 --> 30:30.493
...until we stage the cancer
and see if it's spread.

30:30.755 --> 30:33.671
Which is why we're
gonna do the biopsy.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.879
I can't believe this. I mean,
I came in for a cut on my finger and...

30:41.344 --> 30:43.632
I need to call my wife. I...

30:44.971 --> 30:47.128
How am I gonna tell her?
What am I gonna say?

31:02.398 --> 31:04.224
It's okay.

31:04.399 --> 31:08.311
- I can't believe this is happening.
- I know. I know.

31:09.317 --> 31:11.559
Just let it out and work through it.

31:17.407 --> 31:19.693
You think the injuries
resulted from battery?

31:19.783 --> 31:22.984
- Yep. No question.
- You wanna testify if we need you?

31:23.159 --> 31:25.863
- I guess. You think that's gonna happen?
- It's up to her.

31:26.036 --> 31:29.284
If she won't make a statement,
no witnesses, I can't help her.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.779
The fact he's a cop,
does that make a difference?

31:31.956 --> 31:33.864
No. Not to me.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.492
Have you seen these?

31:39.418 --> 31:42.454
The first time she came in.
Missing two teeth, broken jaw.

31:42.545 --> 31:44.704
Second time, bruises on her back
and buttocks.

31:44.881 --> 31:46.670
Third time, broken arm.

31:46.839 --> 31:50.171
And these? These are from today.

31:50.592 --> 31:52.833
She used to work dispatch at the 14th.

31:53.051 --> 31:55.920
- You know her?
- Used to.

31:56.303 --> 31:59.422
Doug, I signed for the amphotericin B
you ordered for Chia-Chia.

31:59.514 --> 32:01.220
- Got it. Thanks.
- What's the plan?

32:01.306 --> 32:04.390
The plan is to buy that kid
and his mother some time together.

32:04.475 --> 32:08.056
- He didn't respond last time.
- This time I'll give it intrathecally.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.178
That's a pretty rough procedure,
especially on a 4-year-old.

32:11.270 --> 32:13.178
- What are you saying?
- I was wondering...

32:13.271 --> 32:15.843
...if the treatment's extreme
for the best prognosis.

32:16.022 --> 32:18.062
Not in my opinion.

32:20.650 --> 32:21.895
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:39.328 --> 32:41.569
Tell me if you're getting dizzy.

32:43.538 --> 32:44.914
Stop.

32:46.373 --> 32:48.945
Yeah. Hey.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.499
Can you see?

32:50.667 --> 32:52.458
Can you see?

32:52.627 --> 32:55.958
Do you remember the nice lady
from this morning?

32:56.546 --> 33:00.755
Wanna go on the slide?
Let's go on the slide. Come on.

33:03.632 --> 33:05.625
What do you think?

33:13.138 --> 33:15.675
- You designed that yourself?
- Yeah.

33:15.848 --> 33:19.596
You can swim in it or you can
wrap a scarf around your waist...

33:19.768 --> 33:21.309
...and wear it out on the town.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.100
Who does she mean by "you"?

33:23.185 --> 33:26.435
I'm meeting with investors next week
about designing a whole line.

33:26.522 --> 33:29.521
I'm gonna call it "Randi-Wear. "

33:29.689 --> 33:31.397
Catchy.

33:31.565 --> 33:35.513
Well, if you want to invest,
now is the time.

33:35.692 --> 33:38.396
On that note,
I bid you all a fond good eve.

33:38.570 --> 33:42.980
- It's been a wonderful Weaver-less day.
- Nighty-night.

33:44.198 --> 33:46.071
Is he single?

33:47.908 --> 33:49.615
Yeah.

33:50.326 --> 33:52.946
Carrie, your husband's out of surgery.

33:53.119 --> 33:55.360
They were able to reattach his arm.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.791
You said the chances
of that happening were small.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.366
We're not out of the woods.

34:08.545 --> 34:12.042
We still have to wait and see
if the tissue can survive the trauma.

34:14.757 --> 34:16.547
Do you have any Valium or something?

34:17.216 --> 34:18.958
I'd have to write a prescription.

34:19.134 --> 34:22.916
- But I can start a chart for you.
- No, that's okay.

34:24.137 --> 34:26.627
- I'll try a cigarette first.
- You can't...

34:27.222 --> 34:29.047
...smoke in here.

34:30.181 --> 34:31.841
Oh, yeah.

34:34.435 --> 34:36.059
Carrie.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.554
This is good news.

34:38.728 --> 34:42.559
Yeah. It's great.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.723
- Excuse me, Mrs. Loew?
- Yes.

34:51.902 --> 34:55.815
I'm Dr. Greene.
I'm the attending physician here in ER.

34:56.030 --> 34:58.152
I'd like to talk to you about Chia-Chia.

34:58.323 --> 35:00.278
- Something is wrong with Chia-Chia?
- No.

35:00.449 --> 35:04.659
I was talking with Dr. Ross
about the treatment you agreed to.

35:04.826 --> 35:08.076
I wanted to make sure you understood
everything that was involved.

35:08.246 --> 35:09.904
Yes.

35:10.580 --> 35:13.912
The side effects of the medicine
can be very painful.

35:14.081 --> 35:17.247
Worse sometimes than the symptoms
of the meningitis.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.124
- Worse?
- Yes.

35:19.918 --> 35:24.246
I wanna be sure that you know that
if you don't want to go through that...

35:24.421 --> 35:28.418
...we can give you medicine
to make him comfortable...

35:28.591 --> 35:30.083
...and you can take him home.

35:30.717 --> 35:33.799
But he will be sick.

35:34.926 --> 35:36.385
Mrs. Loew...

35:36.553 --> 35:39.505
...the fact that the medicine
failed once before...

35:39.679 --> 35:43.462
...means that there's a strong possibility
that it may fail again.

35:45.225 --> 35:48.307
Even if we could cure
the meningitis...

35:48.476 --> 35:51.678
...your son's AIDS is very advanced.

35:52.311 --> 35:55.311
With or without treatment...

35:55.480 --> 35:59.975
...realistically, we're really
only looking at a matter of days.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.936
I'm sorry.

36:14.282 --> 36:16.488
You need to decide...

36:16.659 --> 36:20.868
...how you and your son
want to spend those days.

36:24.580 --> 36:27.331
But Dr. Ross...

36:32.335 --> 36:36.081
But he...

36:38.630 --> 36:40.870
He said...

37:08.105 --> 37:09.812
- You went over his aftercare?
- I did.

37:09.981 --> 37:12.815
He needs his boil drained.
We got a first trauma pulling in.

37:12.983 --> 37:14.358
Carter, you take him.

37:14.525 --> 37:17.312
- Did you take the syringe in Room 2?
- No. Why?

37:17.486 --> 37:19.726
I just lost 5 milligrams of morphine.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.643
- What do we have?
- This cop is beat up pretty bad.

37:22.821 --> 37:27.149
Missing teeth,
look like his jaw's broke, busted ribs.

37:27.324 --> 37:29.197
- What's his name?
- Mazovick.

37:29.367 --> 37:31.904
- How did it happen?
- He was in pursuit of a suspect...

37:32.077 --> 37:33.535
...and took a bad fall.

37:35.745 --> 37:37.203
Let's get his clothes off.

37:37.371 --> 37:39.411
Get an oral surgeon to wire his teeth.

37:39.498 --> 37:43.030
We got a mandible fracture.
Call X-ray.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.959
Crepitus on the right.
Absent breath sound.

37:46.043 --> 37:48.035
Collapsed lung?
Chest tube tray coming.

37:48.127 --> 37:50.961
- All right, prepping drapo.
- See you around, doc.

37:56.256 --> 37:58.628
- Number 10 blade?
- Yeah.

37:59.718 --> 38:01.840
"Christopher Robin
had wheezles and sneezles.

38:02.011 --> 38:03.468
They bundled him into his bed.

38:03.636 --> 38:06.007
They gave him what goes
with a cold in the nose...

38:06.179 --> 38:08.586
...and some more for the cold
in his head. "

38:09.973 --> 38:12.843
- A.A. Milne?
- Now We Are Six.

38:13.017 --> 38:16.349
- Eeyore was my favorite.
- Tigger.

38:16.935 --> 38:20.883
- So it's time to get started?
- Would you slide that tray over here?

38:22.397 --> 38:26.690
- Hey, we're just getting started.
- I want to take him home.

38:26.858 --> 38:28.933
- Now?
- Yes.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.227
We discussed this.

38:31.402 --> 38:33.228
Now, this is a painful procedure...

38:33.403 --> 38:36.237
...but it's the best shot we have
of buying him more time.

38:36.405 --> 38:38.943
I don't want him to have more pain.

38:39.115 --> 38:41.356
I want him home with me.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.113
Okay.

38:55.207 --> 38:59.333
- You think I make a bad decision?
- I think you're making the right decision.

39:03.378 --> 39:04.788
Thank you.

39:07.423 --> 39:10.789
I'm gonna get the medication
to make sure he's comfortable at home.

39:28.477 --> 39:31.890
Carol, you gotta come see this.

39:32.561 --> 39:35.052
Won't stop coming out.

39:39.065 --> 39:41.307
Won't stop.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.734
Well, I found my missing morphine.

39:44.902 --> 39:48.566
I have to get this clean.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.897
It's Jason's favorite.

39:52.989 --> 39:56.322
There was so much blood.

39:56.492 --> 39:59.775
- I guess we'd better find her a bed.
- Yeah, and some Narcan.

40:00.243 --> 40:02.236
He said it'd be easy.

40:02.412 --> 40:05.614
But the ax wasn't sharp enough.

40:06.247 --> 40:09.697
- What did she say?
- Something about an ax.

40:10.792 --> 40:15.084
We only had three days left
on the policy.

40:15.252 --> 40:17.921
- Oh, my God.
- What?

40:18.088 --> 40:20.459
Her boyfriend's arm.

40:20.630 --> 40:22.089
They chopped it off?

40:22.256 --> 40:23.999
Chop, chop.

40:24.216 --> 40:26.752
Oh, Lordy.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.385
Five bucks says she's in there.

40:32.303 --> 40:35.007
"Carlisle. Denner. Dougherty. "

40:35.181 --> 40:38.050
"Diehl, Carrie. "

40:38.391 --> 40:42.007
Oh, man.
She's been in here half a dozen times.

40:42.184 --> 40:45.517
"Drug-seeking, narcotics OD. "

40:45.687 --> 40:48.556
- I missed it.
- And husband.

40:48.730 --> 40:51.350
Honey, you were burned.

40:52.190 --> 40:53.980
Five bucks.

40:54.857 --> 40:57.942
- Mark, you went behind my back.
- You lost perspective.

40:58.027 --> 41:01.228
You had no right to tell my patient
what you thought she should do.

41:01.403 --> 41:05.234
I've an obligation to make sure patients
have the information to make decisions.

41:05.406 --> 41:09.449
- That's my job.
- Spare me your Attending oath of office.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.652
- We're talking about a 4-year-old.
- A 4-year-old with AIDS...

41:12.744 --> 41:16.076
...you wanted to put through
a torturous procedure his last few days.

41:16.246 --> 41:18.321
- You don't know that. Nobody knows.
- Oh, no!

41:18.497 --> 41:21.863
There's always a miracle!
I thought we were practicing medicine.

41:22.039 --> 41:25.906
I'll tell you something. If it was your kid,
you would bet on a miracle!

41:38.133 --> 41:39.840
Lydia! I got it!

41:40.009 --> 41:41.288
- The job?
- Yes!

41:41.467 --> 41:43.176
Loretta, that's great!

41:43.344 --> 41:46.462
You are looking
at a real, live receptionist.

41:46.637 --> 41:49.305
I knew you could do it.
I am so happy for you.

41:49.472 --> 41:51.050
I beat out five other girls.

41:51.140 --> 41:55.965
Of course, I had to do the guy,
but, hey, I got the job!

42:01.479 --> 42:03.056
Are you okay?

42:03.231 --> 42:06.728
- I'm a mess.
- Yeah. Me too.

42:07.566 --> 42:11.978
You were a big help today.
Thank you.

42:12.569 --> 42:14.775
I was gonna thank you.

42:14.945 --> 42:16.818
For what?
Giving you a front-row seat...

42:16.989 --> 42:20.936
...to the limitations of modern medicine?

42:24.535 --> 42:26.111
For what it's worth...

42:26.285 --> 42:29.070
...I think you were right
to keep trying today.

42:31.371 --> 42:33.991
My medical school professors told me...

42:34.164 --> 42:36.570
...County was full of burnouts
that didn't care.

42:36.916 --> 42:39.667
They got the "burnout" part right.

42:43.169 --> 42:45.541
What do you do after a day like today?

42:46.005 --> 42:50.131
I tend to drink,
but I'm not the best role model.

42:57.386 --> 42:59.627
I wouldn't mind a drink.

43:26.194 --> 43:27.771
Hello.

43:27.945 --> 43:29.604
Hello.

43:29.863 --> 43:33.990
I stopped by your apartment.
Am I interrupting?

43:34.157 --> 43:36.694
No. Pull up a swing.

43:40.077 --> 43:42.531
I talked to Morgenstern.

43:43.871 --> 43:48.116
He said he'd present your request
to the Residency Committee.

43:48.290 --> 43:50.530
Sounds like he wasn't too thrilled.

43:50.707 --> 43:52.499
You ever seen Morgenstern thrilled?

43:53.209 --> 43:54.668
No.

43:57.753 --> 44:00.422
He agreed to consider it.
That's something.

44:02.048 --> 44:05.580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:09.135 --> 44:11.376
I'm keeping her.

44:13.805 --> 44:16.046
That's terrific.

44:16.223 --> 44:18.759
I'm so glad.

44:21.892 --> 44:26.268
- If you need tips on parenting-
- You're the last person I'd call.

44:26.437 --> 44:28.013
Thank you.

44:29.605 --> 44:32.141
- Would you hold her?
- Sure.

44:32.356 --> 44:33.981
Come here.

44:34.150 --> 44:36.722
Yes, hello.

44:36.901 --> 44:39.734
What's your Aunt Susie doing?

44:40.028 --> 44:41.735
- Look at her.
- Hello.

44:41.904 --> 44:44.310
- Look at her go.
- Hello.

44:44.488 --> 44:46.860
She's silly, isn't she?

44:47.157 --> 44:49.563
She's silly, isn't she?

44:51.326 --> 44:54.326
Your Aunt Susie's loopy.

44:54.494 --> 44:56.616
Can you believe she's a doctor?

44:56.787 --> 44:58.578
- Can you?
- No.
