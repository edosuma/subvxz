-Todd!

01:27.670 --> 01:31.382
Just a dream, KJ. Relax.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.510
King Julien! There was an attack
in the village last night.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.138
A horrible, otherworldly monster.
And it got Todd!

01:37.931 --> 01:41.226
Come on, K-jizzle. Wake up!

01:43.478 --> 01:44.479
What was that for?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.064
To see if I'm still dreaming!

01:46.147 --> 01:48.525
You're not dreaming, Your Majesty.
This is real!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.944
Todd's with Dr. S, now.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.779
Little Todd.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.364
But, he was so young!

01:54.447 --> 01:58.409
Why did he have to die, Frank

01:58.493 --> 01:59.661
Todd didn't die.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.871
When Tammy heard all the noise,
she came out.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.791
Monster got so freaked out
by the sight of her, it took off.

02:04.874 --> 02:05.917
Understandable.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.502
Hmm.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.255
What the heck is that?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.841
Just give me a minute to think.

02:12.924 --> 02:17.554
It's Gecko Milk. Unfiltered. It's whole,
raw, organic, non-GMO.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.890
Masikura's got me on some kind
of cleanse. Supposed to be good for, uh...

02:21.057 --> 02:22.058
stress, I don't know.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.935

Mort gave me that I didn't read.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.312
What do you gotta be stressed about?

02:26.396 --> 02:29.732
I've been through a lot lately, Mo-Mo!
I mean...

02:31.359 --> 02:32.569
Hold on.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.779
Oh, wait.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.075
What the heck did that gecko eat?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.619
Okay, that's better. Let's go see Todd.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.498
Give it to us straight, doc.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.542
Mort did this, right?

02:47.917 --> 02:51.004
Wasn't me. Not this time.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.173
Once we get the results from the autopsy,

02:54.257 --> 02:56.718
the cause of death will be much clearer.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.761
Hold on. Todd didn't die!

02:58.845 --> 03:00.555
He didn't?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.390
Oh.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.892
Let me have another look.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.852
I'm okay. Really.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.354
My back's a little sore.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.649
Little girl is delusional.
Gonna have to put her down, y'all.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.818
Todd is a boy, Butterfish!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.361
Back you say?

03:15.862 --> 03:17.280
Let me take a look.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.325
Ah! Yes, I see.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.454
I have no idea what could have done this!

03:24.704 --> 03:25.914
I do!

03:27.332 --> 03:28.583
It was a Night Creature!

Meh.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.555
Can't be that great a story,
I've never even heard of the reboot.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.350
It's not a story! It really happened!

03:45.433 --> 03:47.185
This is King Julien the Second.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.192
Also King Julien the Second.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.987
Woof! That is some serious
party road damage.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.782
He didn't become this way from partying,
Your Majesty.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.702
King Julien the Second was cursed!

04:05.495 --> 04:07.080
<i>Once inflicted with the curse,</i>

04:07.288 --> 04:09.791
<i>the king would wake up</i>

04:14.963 --> 04:19.050

04:23.930 --> 04:26.641

04:47.203 --> 04:50.081
Aw! You gotta be kidding me!
It ends on a cliffhanger?

04:50.164 --> 04:53.126
What? No. She killed the Night Creature
with a golden spear

04:53.209 --> 04:54.585
and buried him in a tomb!

04:54.711 --> 04:58.256
Heh. Wow! I did not get that.

04:58.756 --> 05:02.176
If I'm right, there's another
Night Creature out there,

05:02.635 --> 05:04.595

Just look at him.

Am I right, Mo
You were there for one or two, right?

05:27.952 --> 05:29.495
We can't let anyone know about this.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.357
to visit the kingdom?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.903
We heard about what happened,
and thought a check-in was in order.

Todd Please tell me
it isn't another plague.

06:10.244 --> 06:14.290
Repopulating a kingdom
after a mass die-off is such a chore.

06:14.373 --> 06:18.127
Darling, we're here
because you lost the kingdom to Koto.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.464
And spent your entire kingdom's budget
on a war spanning...

06:21.547 --> 06:24.383

an entire season?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.344
Oh! That old chestnut.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.098
We got the kingdom back,

Up-up-up, not so fast, son.

Your uncle was kind enough to fill us in

06:50.993 --> 06:54.664
We just wanted to make sure things
were running smoothly again.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.501
