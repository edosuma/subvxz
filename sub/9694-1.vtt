00:30.730 --> 00:34.866
My daughter will be singing
in the competition tomorrow evening.

00:34.867 --> 00:38.860
- Oh, June Allison.
- Oh, Loretta Young.

00:38.937 --> 00:42.703
Her late father and I
had such high hopes for her.

00:42.774 --> 00:46.540
But she's determined
to try to be a singer.

00:46.612 --> 00:49.809
- I suppose she has
some talent in that area.

00:49.882 --> 00:52.214
It's such a relief you were able
to accommodate us...

00:52.284 --> 00:54.218
by bringing
the dresses here today.

00:54.286 --> 00:56.220
Thank you.

00:56.288 --> 00:59.724
Oh! Mother?
This is it.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.987
The perfect dress.

01:03.061 --> 01:06.292
Mother, it's a beautiful dress.
But it's not for my figure.

01:06.365 --> 01:09.129
A well-made dress works
on any figure.

01:09.201 --> 01:11.635
Certainly, Mother.

01:12.971 --> 01:14.905
You're so willful, Edna.

01:16.108 --> 01:18.576
Just like my sister,
your namesake,

01:18.644 --> 01:22.239
where in her wild youth,
she found herself in the family way.

01:22.314 --> 01:25.249
Your father got her a doctor
and took care of her problem.

01:25.317 --> 01:28.445
She hemorrhaged
and was scarred inside forever.

01:28.520 --> 01:34.015
My mother made me swear I'd name
my first daughter after Edna,

01:34.092 --> 01:38.119
- Who could never bear children
of her own.

01:38.196 --> 01:40.756
Turn around, Edna.

01:40.832 --> 01:43.926
We'll take the dress she has on.

01:46.838 --> 01:51.002
Mother, I can't sing
in a dress that doesn't fit.

01:51.076 --> 01:53.044
Look at it.

01:54.112 --> 01:57.172
The dress fits the occasion.

01:57.249 --> 01:59.274
It's you who doesn't fit.

09:19.691 --> 09:23.684
It's just that, you know,
I came here 11 months ago.

09:23.762 --> 09:26.697
Supposed to be
this big recording contract.

09:26.765 --> 09:29.928
And I won this prize.
Just all a big publicity stunt.

09:30.001 --> 09:33.095
Bunch of rats. Was it...
It was McMartin, right?

09:33.171 --> 09:35.639
Yeah, it was.

09:35.707 --> 09:38.540
And now I've been pounding
the pavement ever since,

09:38.610 --> 09:42.273
only to be told that you just
already have someone like me.

09:42.347 --> 09:44.907

really burst your bubble?

09:44.983 --> 09:46.917
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

You know, start bursting.

Well, not only do we all
already have someone like you,

09:54.192 --> 09:56.956
but we all
are trying to get rid...

09:57.028 --> 09:59.462
of the someones like you
we already have.

09:59.531 --> 10:02.193
- Yeah, well.

10:02.267 --> 10:06.135
See, the thing of it is, toots, the
Patti Page/Peggy Lee days, they're over.

10:06.204 --> 10:09.139
- Yeah.
- Lady singers, they just don't sell.

10:09.207 --> 10:11.675

that's the ticket these days.

10:11.743 --> 10:13.938
Yeah. You know,
I wrote it.

10:14.012 --> 10:16.537

such strong material.

13:48.593 --> 13:51.528

13:56.100 --> 13:59.433

13:59.504 --> 14:02.200
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes? Yes? Good.

14:02.273 --> 14:05.436
This song is perfect for their voices.
We could all make money.

14:05.510 --> 14:10.243
- I bet you have other songs too.
- No, I'm planning
to record my own songs.

14:10.314 --> 14:13.545
What do you mean? You're either
a singer or songwriter. Which is it?

14:13.618 --> 14:16.416
- I'm both.
- Nobody's both.
You're either one or the other.

14:16.487 --> 14:18.421

14:22.994 --> 14:26.395

- Let me prove it.

I'm from New Jersey.

14:49.253 --> 14:51.312
- Can I be perfectly honest?
- Hmm?

14:51.389 --> 14:53.857
You gotta change your name.

14:53.925 --> 14:56.450
Edna Buxton. That's the worst
name I ever heard in my life.

14:56.527 --> 14:58.739
Where are you from that would curse you
with a name like that?

14:58.763 --> 15:01.630
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, ouch. Keeps getting worse.

15:01.699 --> 15:04.793

with someone you can't have,

16:13.437 --> 16:16.565
and you let 'em go
and have their own life... beautiful.

16:16.641 --> 16:19.007
It's something that
happened to me before.

16:19.076 --> 16:22.512
I know how personal it must be.
I don't want to invade your privacy.

16:22.580 --> 16:26.038
- I just want to do the song righteous.

Listen, the song is yours, guys.

16:31.989 --> 16:34.082
It's never happened
to me anyway.

16:34.158 --> 16:37.889
I just made it up to pass
the night away, you know.

16:37.962 --> 16:40.988
- Denise, we need a B-side.
What else you got?
- B-side?

16:41.065 --> 16:44.228
Well, you know, I sort of write

16:44.302 --> 16:46.770
-  We need somethin' upbeat.
- Upbeat?

16:46.838 --> 16:49.329
Up-tempo? Okay.
Something... Hmm.

16:49.407 --> 16:53.366
Something new for me, but okay.
Let's see what I can do.

16:53.978 --> 16:56.071
- You get the same percentage as me.
- Okay.

16:56.147 --> 16:58.809
But this is only until I can
record my own stuff, right?

16:58.883 --> 17:01.562

- Absolutely, when the time is right.

Now I want you to worry about
writing the songs.

17:10.261 --> 17:13.195
I want personal ones
like "In Another World."

17:13.263 --> 17:16.700
Now I am worried. What if I can't
just think up another one like that?

17:16.767 --> 17:19.031
Keep your eyes and ears open.
Everyone is in pain.

17:19.103 --> 17:21.367

phenomenon is songwriter Denise Waverly.

"Her haunting courage

"is both bittersweet
and affirming.

"The Luminaries are the great
vocal discovery of the year,

power is Denise Waverly."

34:13.717 --> 34:18.154

Sure, but you realize,
of course, that no one else...

34:21.291 --> 34:25.387
is writing pop songs
about unwed pregnancy, just you.

34:25.462 --> 34:29.398
I was wondering, is it because of your
working class background...

34:29.466 --> 34:33.766
that you feel free to examine these
very real, honest themes in your music?

34:36.739 --> 34:41.938
Um... I can assure you my background
doesn't have anything to do with it.

34:43.580 --> 34:47.311
I'm curious. You had a big hit last year
with "In Another World"...

34:47.384 --> 34:49.614

- No.
- Huh?

38:15.692 --> 38:17.956
- You do. Look at you.
-  Do not!

38:18.027 --> 38:20.757

38:37.947 --> 38:40.643

- I know, the new receptionist.

38:40.717 --> 38:44.619
Oh, golly, no. This lady here
is a new member...

38:44.687 --> 38:47.383
of the Charny Music family.

38:47.457 --> 38:49.391
I just signed
Cheryl and her partner.

38:49.459 --> 38:53.452
First song they've written
is gonna be the Luminaries' next hit.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.589
Oh, that's great!
That's great.

38:55.665 --> 38:58.429
- Thanks.
- They could use a hit.

38:58.501 --> 39:01.902
The last three songs we wrote for them
were banned from the radios.

39:01.971 --> 39:06.374
It's funny, because in Europe
such bannings are never heard of.

39:06.442 --> 39:10.242
- Really?
- I guess it's 'cause
we're far more freethinking.

39:10.313 --> 39:13.612
- Yeah.
- Denise Waverly.

39:13.683 --> 39:16.584
Cheryl Steed. Hi.

39:16.653 --> 39:20.783
Well, if you need anything,
my office is just down the hall.

39:20.857 --> 39:24.258
Thank you, and mine
is just next door,

39:24.327 --> 39:27.057
- If you need me for anything.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.223
-  What?
- Uh, next door?

39:29.299 --> 39:33.201
The front of the building.
You have windows. That's nice.

39:33.269 --> 39:36.102
L... I insisted.
This place is so dreary.

39:36.172 --> 39:38.106
- Mm, yeah.
- Hello.

39:38.174 --> 39:39.698
Hi.

39:39.776 --> 39:42.040
- Howard, honey,
- Hmm?

39:42.111 --> 39:44.204
This is Cheryl,

39:44.280 --> 39:46.561
- And she's part of
the Charny Music family now.
- Charmed.

39:46.616 --> 39:50.108
- Welcome.
- So just think of her like a sister.

39:50.186 --> 39:53.553
Howard is my writing partner,
and he's also my boyfriend.

39:53.623 --> 39:55.716
- Oh.
- Who's your partner?

39:55.792 --> 39:59.159
Uh, Matthew.
He... He's my husband.

39:59.229 --> 40:02.687
Oh! That's great.
Isn't that great?

40:03.833 --> 40:05.801

40:29.692 --> 40:32.525
Cheryl, your husband's
20 minutes late!

40:32.595 --> 40:36.122
I know. But I called and they said
he's on his way. I think we should wait.

40:36.199 --> 40:39.498
- Where is he?
- We have to wait for Matthew.
I can't start without him.

40:39.569 --> 40:42.299
- Time is money and money
is time. Let's go.
- Come on, Joel.

40:42.372 --> 40:44.772

40:44.841 --> 40:47.605

No, you can't be.

I went to the doctor today and, um...
Well, he's pretty sure that I am.

42:49.332 --> 42:52.859
I just have to wait

- That's my family's business.
- You putting me on?

43:14.791 --> 43:18.750
You see, Joel invented the whole name
and the working class persona,

43:18.828 --> 43:21.273
and I didn't know how to tell you
'cause you'd be disappointed.

43:21.297 --> 43:24.323
Let me get this straight. You're
telling me that you're an heiress?

43:24.400 --> 43:26.493
- Yeah.
- You're an heiress?

43:26.569 --> 43:28.503
- Yeah.
- You're an heiress?

43:28.571 --> 43:31.005
- Yeah.
- You don't look like an heiress.

43:31.073 --> 43:35.271
That's nice. What's an heiress
supposed to look like?

43:35.344 --> 43:40.839
Grace Kelly. That's funny. That's the
sort of woman I thought I'd end up with.

43:40.917 --> 43:45.286

- Honey, listen. I'm sorry.

43:55.031 --> 43:59.161
It's just I'm scared, that's all.
We don't have any money right now.

you'd consider writing a song for me.

50:26.956 --> 50:31.120
- Oh.
- I mean, people have, you know,
certain ideas about me...

50:31.193 --> 50:35.061
that are created by my publicist
and this TV show that I do.

50:35.130 --> 50:39.624
They really have no idea
who I am or what my life is like...

50:39.702 --> 50:41.795
or what I go through...

50:41.871 --> 50:46.001
with the person I love.

50:46.075 --> 50:47.872
Kelly.

50:49.945 --> 50:53.642
- You know, boy problems
are always hard.

50:55.718 --> 50:57.982
I wouldn't know.

51:01.423 --> 51:03.357
Sorry, I'm fine.

51:03.425 --> 51:08.829
Now, I read that Johnny Crawford
gave you a puppy for your birthday.

51:08.898 --> 51:12.834
- That is so fabulous.
He's such a dream boat.
- Trust you to read that.

51:12.902 --> 51:17.168
- He is very good looking.
- He's very nice. He sweats a lot.

51:17.239 --> 51:20.265

- Hi, Marion.

51:20.342 --> 51:22.970

- Yeah, sure.

51:23.045 --> 51:26.242

- Yeah, I think we...

51:26.315 --> 51:29.773
- Got a great sense of who
you are, what you're about...
- I've got some ideas.

51:29.852 --> 51:33.379
- And we're gonna write you
a terrific song.
- Wonderful.

51:33.455 --> 51:37.289

any kind of questions.
- Bye, Kelly and Marion.

51:37.359 --> 51:39.293

- Phil Spector?
- Phil Spector, history!

01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:02.263
Shadow Morton?
Shadow Morton?

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:05.265
This guy's no Liberace,
who I feel is valid in his own right.

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:08.769
He's an Einstein
in the control booth. He's a wizard.

01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:10.702
Direct your eyes right here.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.040
♪ Take a run at the sun ♪

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:18.671
While The Beatles
and The Byrds are both at work on...

01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:22.513
what are being termed "concept albums",
teen favorites, The Riptides,

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:24.518
are also changing directions.

01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:26.781
Oh, Joel.

01:05:26.855 --> 01:05:29.847
Jay Phillips, the one on the guitar.
He's the brains behind the band,

01:05:29.924 --> 01:05:32.950
- And the wizard behind your next hit.
- On their last album,

01:05:33.027 --> 01:05:35.461
Jay Phillips caught
the critics' attention...

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:38.761
when he added orchestral instruments
into their popular surf sound.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:42.462
Surf and turf stuff.
That's not my thing.

01:05:42.537 --> 01:05:46.405
It seems this was only
the beginning of Phillip's imagination.

01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:49.773
- Tell us what we can expect
from this new record.

01:05:49.844 --> 01:05:52.472
Well, I really don't know
what to expect myself.

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:56.415
I'm kinda... just gonna sort of
let the album dictate itself to me.

01:05:56.484 --> 01:06:02.013
But I can guarantee it'll be
different from anything you've
heard from The Riptides before.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.854
Very, very talented.
Very sweet.

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.156
A little out there.
He's from California.

01:06:07.228 --> 01:06:11.164
Is there any particular theme
or subject stringing it all together...

01:06:11.232 --> 01:06:16.727
like some of the other
concept albums being recorded now?

01:06:16.805 --> 01:06:20.138
Childhood. Innocence.

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:25.475
How a kid looks at things. How a kid'll
make up a song so the lyrics...

01:06:25.547 --> 01:06:29.779
don't always make sense to, uh,
adults.

01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:32.319
Kids are cool.

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:36.756
- Can you give us an example of a lyric?
- He's not so bad.

01:06:36.825 --> 01:06:39.487
I heard Lennon wrote a song
about a walrus...

01:06:39.561 --> 01:06:42.359
and McGuinn wrote a song
about a spaceman.

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:45.729
There's a thing in music now
where you can write a song about...

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.600
You can write a song about anything at
all, not just a protest or love songs.

01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:54.631
On this new album, I'm into
writin' songs like kids do when
they're singing to themselves...

01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:58.611
- Or playin' in their yard.
-  Sounds pretty far out.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.614
Yeah, far out.

01:07:00.682 --> 01:07:02.673
The world's waiting, Jay.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.186
Listen, I want you to
seriously think about this.

01:07:06.254 --> 01:07:08.620
- Hmm.
- Hear what I said?

01:07:12.026 --> 01:07:14.017
- Sorry.

01:07:14.095 --> 01:07:16.962
So, I'll just...
It's been a while.

01:07:17.031 --> 01:07:21.195

you got involved in the work.

really cool to celebrate.

Lexington and Sha Sha getting married,

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.722

01:14:28.796 --> 01:14:31.663

Cheryl, I thought maybe...

Nah. Nothing's going on with us.
It's strictly business. You see?

01:14:43.911 --> 01:14:47.278

and l... I don't mess around.

I mean, do you have a plan?

01:18:48.289 --> 01:18:50.655
I don't know
if I'll put yours up.

01:18:50.724 --> 01:18:54.251
Edna, man, who was down
at the studio, man?

01:18:54.328 --> 01:18:56.819
My tapes. Somebody fucked
with my tapes, man.

01:18:56.897 --> 01:19:00.230
Jay, no one's been in the studio.
We've been here all day.

01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:02.701
These boxes are empty!

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.981
- Somebody was in the studio.
- No one was in the studio.

01:19:05.005 --> 01:19:07.769
Somebody took my tapes.
Somebody fucked with my tapes, man.

01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:10.776
- If they didn't like the song...
- Would you calm down?

01:19:10.844 --> 01:19:12.971
Don't tell me, Edna!
What do you think I am?

01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:15.311
Jay, I don't even go
in the goddamn studio.

01:19:15.382 --> 01:19:17.360
What happened to the tapes?
They're not in the studio!

01:19:17.384 --> 01:19:19.682
- Annie, get the kids.
Take them in the house.
- Come on.

01:19:19.753 --> 01:19:22.950
Go ahead, protect them! Who's lookin'
out for me and my fuckin' songs?

01:19:23.023 --> 01:19:26.220
You were talkin' and kissin' ass with
those three fuckin' morons.

01:19:26.293 --> 01:19:28.727
They're not even in my band.
I write all the songs.

01:19:28.796 --> 01:19:32.698
- I taught 'em how to play
every fuckin' instrument.
- Would you please stop now?

01:19:32.766 --> 01:19:36.065
Fuckin' empty, man!
Empty! Zilch!

01:19:36.136 --> 01:19:38.070
They're missing!
Empty!

01:19:39.173 --> 01:19:41.437
For chrissakes, Jay!

01:19:42.409 --> 01:19:44.775
I got my eye on you.

01:19:53.087 --> 01:19:55.146
All right, Jay.

01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:03.993
Secure all windows, all doors.

01:20:04.064 --> 01:20:07.158
All access into the house
is to be taped and wired.

01:20:07.234 --> 01:20:09.168
Now, down here
we got the studio.

01:20:09.236 --> 01:20:11.363
We got an intercom...

01:20:11.438 --> 01:20:13.372
running up from the studio.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.170
Run your wires
down along the steps here.

01:20:16.243 --> 01:20:18.541
What about these skylights, man?

01:20:18.612 --> 01:20:21.274
We're puttin' 'em back in
as soon as we run our wires down.

01:20:21.348 --> 01:20:23.373
I mean, somebody could
come up on the roof.

01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:25.941
- Oh, you want to secure your skylights?
- Hey, baby.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.717
- You could put bars across them.
- Good morning, Jay.

01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:31.917
- Jay?
- Good morning.

01:20:31.992 --> 01:20:33.983
Sweetie, um,

01:20:34.061 --> 01:20:36.325
what's, uh, going on?

01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:38.831
- Fortification.
- Hmm?

01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:42.335
- Um, this gentleman here
is a security expert.
- Ah.

01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:45.395
From now on, no one will
have access to this room...

01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:48.236
except for you and me.

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:52.006
- That's it.
- Okay.

01:20:52.079 --> 01:20:55.810
Uh, sweetie,
I'm gonna go see Cheryl.

01:20:55.883 --> 01:20:57.976
- I'll see you later. Okay.
- Groovy.

01:20:58.052 --> 01:21:00.953
Listen, man, how about
some guard dogs or somethin'?

01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:03.922
-  Dogs are good.
-  Yeah, we got these puppies...

01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:05.424
Jay?

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:08.120
- You need some... Yeah?
- What is this?

01:21:08.195 --> 01:21:10.254
Those are my tapes.
I found them.

01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:12.663
You need some Dobies
or some rottweilers. Somethin' big.

01:21:12.733 --> 01:21:15.201
- Jay, the lost tapes?
- Yeah.

01:21:16.837 --> 01:21:20.773
I could put a perimeter system
right around your board there.

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:25.841

I really miss...
I miss the work, I really do.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.703
If you're really interested
in doing something again, I'll
introduce you to the producer.

01:21:39.727 --> 01:21:42.025
- Really?
- He's desperate for people to write.

01:21:42.096 --> 01:21:45.031
They need songs every week.
I'm inundated.

01:21:45.099 --> 01:21:47.192
- I'm overworked at the moment.

01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:50.259
I gotta tell you, you know what?
I would really love it.

01:21:50.337 --> 01:21:52.271
You're too good
for this stuff, but...

01:21:52.339 --> 01:21:55.365
It's great. Your mom is gonna
be proud when she sees this castle.

01:21:55.442 --> 01:21:58.104
- Hey, what's this? A sand castle?
- Hey, Mom.

01:21:58.178 --> 01:22:00.339
- It's a sand fort.
- Oh.

01:22:00.414 --> 01:22:02.348
It's a fort.

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:06.318
Listen, I've got some great news.
I got a job today.

01:22:06.387 --> 01:22:08.321

- Yeah.

01:22:10.958 --> 01:22:12.892
Doing what?

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.394
Well, you see, Cheryl's
friends with the producer,

01:22:15.462 --> 01:22:17.896
and I'm gonna be doing
the only thing I know how to do.

01:22:17.965 --> 01:22:20.058
I'm gonna be writing songs.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:22.364
That's not the only thing
you know how to do.

01:22:22.436 --> 01:22:24.370
You're an artist.

01:22:24.438 --> 01:22:26.338
You wanna see
something cool, Luma?

01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:30.844
Well, Jay, the artist in me is gonna be
writing songs for "Where The Action Is."

01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:33.539
"Jay, the artist in me is
gonna be writing songs...

01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:36.481
for some pop bubble-gum show,
Jay, and I'm really excited about it."

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:39.485
- I mean, will you listen to yourself?
- What?

01:22:39.553 --> 01:22:41.544
You don't need a job.
You have money.

01:22:41.622 --> 01:22:44.716
And if you're not gonna use it
to develop yourself as an artist,

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:46.726
then get rid of it.

01:22:46.794 --> 01:22:49.661
Throw it away!
Throw it in the fucking ocean!

01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:52.858
All right, Jay,
I'll get rid of it.

01:22:52.933 --> 01:22:55.800
But you know what?
I gotta report to the set in an hour.

01:22:57.438 --> 01:23:00.532
You wanna wish me luck?

Denise, the only thing
I wish for you...

01:23:03.243 --> 01:23:07.304
and I really, sincerely mean this...
is that you are fired.

01:23:08.515 --> 01:23:10.506
That's nice.

01:23:10.584 --> 01:23:14.020
I mean that for your own good.
You are doing yourself a disservice.

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:19.323
That's great, Jay.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

and he came home without them.

- Have you called the police?
- Yes, I called the police
and the kids are okay.

01:24:57.257 --> 01:24:59.802
They found them hiding in
some old ice cream truck in the museum.

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:16.419
He just tore up the place and
dragged the mattress into the studio.

Let me go speak to Jay...
- Yeah, yeah.

Go speak to your man,
'cause that's what you need to do.

that when you come home,

you have to have

01:26:03.457 --> 01:26:07.018
- What am I supposed to tell him?
- One minute they were there.

One minute they were there?

01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:12.463

- You would like me to say...

01:26:12.532 --> 01:26:16.024
that one minute they were there,
and the next minute they were just gone.

01:26:16.103 --> 01:26:19.197
- Is that it, Jay?

01:26:23.844 --> 01:26:26.779
-  Denise, the cops are here.

01:26:29.549 --> 01:26:31.915
Oh, Luma, come here, sweetie.

01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:34.647
- Did you have a little adventure?
- Thank you.

01:26:34.721 --> 01:26:38.248
- Thank you very much, officers.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

01:26:38.325 --> 01:26:42.284
- If I was you, I would be
so furious with him.
- What am I supposed to do?

01:26:42.362 --> 01:26:46.059
People want you to promise
through sickness and in health
and make that commitment...

01:26:46.133 --> 01:26:48.863
and then they want you to
check out the minute there's a problem.

01:26:48.935 --> 01:26:51.369
Well, I can't do that.
I'm his wife.

01:26:51.438 --> 01:26:54.271
And what, am I supposed to walk away
from him now that he's in trouble?

01:26:54.341 --> 01:26:56.275
Can't do that.

01:26:56.343 --> 01:26:59.244
Would he walk out on me if
I was falling apart?

01:26:59.312 --> 01:27:01.507
No, of course he wouldn't.

01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:05.073
Well, if you won't leave him
then you'd... You'd better help him.

01:27:05.152 --> 01:27:07.780
I don't know how to help him.

01:27:07.854 --> 01:27:09.754
Well, I'd get him a doctor.

01:27:09.823 --> 01:27:12.314
I hate doctors.

01:27:12.392 --> 01:27:16.624
Okay, artist in crisis.

01:27:16.697 --> 01:27:19.757
- That's why people call me.
- Look, look, look, Doc.

01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:22.859
He's been holed up in that studio
for three weeks...

01:27:22.936 --> 01:27:25.598
without bathin'
or talkin' to anyone.

01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:30.041
I don't mean to minimize
Jay's state.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.214
I apologize.

01:27:37.884 --> 01:27:41.786
Are you fearful that you,
or your loved ones, are in danger?

01:27:41.855 --> 01:27:46.292
No, he'd never hurt,
you know, me or Luma, no.

01:27:46.359 --> 01:27:49.453
Do you believe
he's using narcotics?

01:27:50.764 --> 01:27:53.631
Well, I mean,
he smokes a little grass...

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.227
- And, you know,
he does some psychedelics...
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:57.304 --> 01:28:00.000
And mushrooms and peyote.

01:28:00.073 --> 01:28:02.803
- But he's down on hard drugs.
- Yeah.

01:28:02.876 --> 01:28:04.810
So basically...

01:28:04.878 --> 01:28:09.713
you want him to know
you're concerned and that you care.

01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:12.411
And that you want
to be reassured...

01:28:12.486 --> 01:28:15.284
that he's okay.

01:28:17.324 --> 01:28:21.454
I want him to know
that I care about him...

01:28:21.528 --> 01:28:25.862
and I want him to know
I love him...

01:28:25.932 --> 01:28:30.699
and l... I really want to make sure
that he finishes his album,

01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:33.740

it is to him, you know?

01:28:33.807 --> 01:28:36.002
It's everything.

01:28:37.577 --> 01:28:40.068

01:28:41.848 --> 01:28:44.214
Uh, Jay?

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.752
A friend of yours stopped by.

01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.721
Jay, it's Jonesy.

01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:51.724
Hey, Jonesy, man.

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:53.726
What's happenin'?

01:28:53.794 --> 01:28:56.729
Hey, man, I'd like to come in
and rap for a minute.

01:28:56.797 --> 01:28:58.731
You know?

01:28:58.799 --> 01:29:03.634
Oh, well, I don't know, man.
I'm workin', I'm real busy.

01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:05.967
I'm talkin' to my muse, man.

01:29:06.039 --> 01:29:09.031
Maybe you could
introduce me to her.

01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:12.408
I'm, uh, single now, you know.

01:29:12.479 --> 01:29:16.813
Where are you at, man?
Hey.

01:29:16.883 --> 01:29:19.784
There you are.

01:29:19.853 --> 01:29:22.549
Man, it is...

01:29:22.622 --> 01:29:25.819
so far out to see you again.

01:29:25.892 --> 01:29:28.918
Goin' through some changes, huh?

01:29:32.032 --> 01:29:35.490
Doctor has brought some...

01:29:35.569 --> 01:29:37.969
herbal medicine.

01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:43.600
Where's the muse?

01:29:45.045 --> 01:29:48.139
I could use a little
inspiration myself.

01:29:48.215 --> 01:29:50.513
You know where to find it, man.

01:29:50.584 --> 01:29:52.609
The muse.

01:29:52.686 --> 01:29:56.452
She lives in the cave...

01:29:56.523 --> 01:30:00.015
where everything
you ever lost lives.

01:30:00.093 --> 01:30:02.323
But...

01:30:02.395 --> 01:30:05.626
you have everything, Jay.

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:08.133
I had everything.

01:30:09.769 --> 01:30:12.203
I lost everything.

01:30:15.508 --> 01:30:17.942
I lost everything that mattered.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:23.215

01:30:26.987 --> 01:30:29.182
'Til I met Denise.

01:30:30.257 --> 01:30:33.624
You saw her.
Oh, man.

01:30:33.693 --> 01:30:37.459
She's so beautiful.
And her kid.

01:30:38.899 --> 01:30:42.198
- Left her fuckin' kid
at the museum, man.
- Jay.

01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:44.703
- Suppose you heard about that.
- Jay, listen.

01:30:44.771 --> 01:30:46.864
Man, you spaced out.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.603
Man, you know me, man. You know
I love kids and I love animals and shit.

01:30:50.677 --> 01:30:54.238
- I wouldn't fuckin'...
- You spaced out, man.

01:30:54.314 --> 01:30:56.373
Listen, you're dealin'
with some heavy shit.

01:30:56.449 --> 01:30:59.543
You got people tellin' you
you're the voice of your generation...

01:30:59.619 --> 01:31:02.019
and, "What's he gonna
say next?"

01:31:02.088 --> 01:31:05.057
You gotta cut yourself
some slack.

01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:09.061
Cut Jay some slack
and pick up...

01:31:09.129 --> 01:31:12.189

01:31:12.265 --> 01:31:16.201

Jay did let go of life.

01:42:02.949 --> 01:42:07.682
He drowned himself.
He's dead.

01:42:07.753 --> 01:42:10.085
You couldn't save him
while he was alive...

01:42:10.156 --> 01:42:13.250
and now you're gonna waste
your own precious life and Luma's...

01:42:13.326 --> 01:42:15.590
tryin' to save him
after he's dead?

01:42:15.661 --> 01:42:20.098
- That makes sense to you?
- Yeah, it does.

01:42:21.767 --> 01:42:24.099
You just wouldn't get it.

01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:27.503
You just don't get it.
You never will.

01:42:28.741 --> 01:42:31.869
Well, I know one thing,
that the only sense...

01:42:31.944 --> 01:42:34.674
any of these jerks you've
allowed to sidetrack you...

01:42:34.747 --> 01:42:39.013
have had in common is a belief
in your talent, I know that.

01:42:39.085 --> 01:42:41.019
Yeah.

01:42:42.121 --> 01:42:45.887
Well, you know, talent...

01:42:45.958 --> 01:42:50.395
is pretty meaningless
when someone you love is dead.

01:42:50.463 --> 01:42:54.160
Your talent is meaningless
to you, Denise.

01:42:54.233 --> 01:42:56.167
It always has been.

01:42:56.235 --> 01:43:00.262
- From day one you were tellin' me
how you wanted to make a record.
- I made a record.

01:43:00.339 --> 01:43:04.002
- Yeah.
- About a thousand years
ago, and it flopped.

01:43:04.076 --> 01:43:07.842
Okay? I put myself out there
and they didn't want me.

01:43:07.913 --> 01:43:10.575
And they were right.
They were right.

01:43:10.650 --> 01:43:13.483
I failed and I've accepted it...

01:43:13.552 --> 01:43:16.988
and I have come to peace with it
and I've gone on with my life.

01:43:17.056 --> 01:43:19.684
And so you give up
after one flop, huh?

01:43:19.759 --> 01:43:21.954
I thought you were made
of tougher stuff.

01:43:22.028 --> 01:43:25.020
The last thing I ever took
you to be was a coward.

01:43:25.097 --> 01:43:28.362
Look at you, out in the mud,
pullin' up turnips!

01:43:32.238 --> 01:43:35.230
You know, I don't need
a lecture, okay?

01:43:35.307 --> 01:43:39.710
I'm a little old
for a little pep talk from Joel.

01:43:39.779 --> 01:43:42.942
Especially from you. You wouldn't know
the first thing about...

01:43:43.015 --> 01:43:46.644
giving yourself to someone,
about sharing your life with someone,

01:43:46.719 --> 01:43:48.710
sharing your pain with them.

01:43:48.788 --> 01:43:51.382
You wouldn't know the
first thing about it.

01:43:51.457 --> 01:43:54.449
- You think you're the only one
shit happens to, huh?
- Yeah.

01:43:54.527 --> 01:43:57.860
Huh?
Well, think again, kiddo.

01:43:57.930 --> 01:44:00.194
I've had my own share
of disappointments...

01:44:00.266 --> 01:44:03.758
in this secondary existence
of a life I live.

01:44:03.836 --> 01:44:06.862
In my business I've been disappointed
and, yeah, big surprise,

01:44:06.939 --> 01:44:10.170
in my big dumb heart,
and it didn't come from playing it safe.

01:44:10.242 --> 01:44:12.506
- You said yourself...

01:44:12.578 --> 01:44:16.674
that the very thing Jay wanted
was for you to make that record.

01:44:16.749 --> 01:44:19.877
- Yeah.
- And if he hasn't let go of life,

01:44:19.952 --> 01:44:23.547
it's 'cause he's as disgusted as I am
to see you sittin' here,

01:44:23.622 --> 01:44:26.216
feelin' sorry for yourself
and givin' up!

01:44:26.292 --> 01:44:28.886
- Oh, you're fuckin' disgusted?
- That's right.

01:44:28.961 --> 01:44:31.452
You wouldn't even have a life
if it wasn't for me!

01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:34.260
- That's right!
- You're the one who's a fuckin' leech!

01:44:34.333 --> 01:44:36.733
- I am a leech, that's right!
- Yeah, you are!

01:44:36.802 --> 01:44:39.965
- That's why I'm here.
- You wouldn't have a life
if it wasn't for me!

01:44:40.039 --> 01:44:42.633
- Oh, really?
- You live every fuckin'
thing through me!

01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:44.835
- So fuck you!
- Fuck me?

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:47.174
- Yeah, fuck you!
- Then fuck off! Fuck you!

01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:50.215
- No, fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

01:44:50.282 --> 01:44:53.012
- That's right, hit me!

01:44:53.085 --> 01:44:56.851
- Go ahead! Go ahead!

01:44:58.691 --> 01:45:01.125
I am sad!

01:45:02.828 --> 01:45:04.955
And I'm alone.

01:45:22.982 --> 01:45:25.075
I'm sorry.

01:45:27.052 --> 01:45:29.452
I'm sorry.

01:45:50.676 --> 01:45:52.974
and I wanna round out
the bottom on the bass.

01:45:53.045 --> 01:45:55.479
Whoa, what was that?
Who you talkin' to, huh?

01:45:55.548 --> 01:45:59.917
Joel, I'm talking to Jay
'cause I need his help on the EQs.

01:45:59.985 --> 01:46:02.647
As long as it's work-related,
you can talk to dead guys.

01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:04.655
Thanks.

01:46:04.723 --> 01:46:06.782
Everyone is excited
about this album.

01:46:06.859 --> 01:46:09.123
You realize that?
Even your old pal.

01:46:09.195 --> 01:46:11.129
- Who?
- John Murray.

01:46:11.197 --> 01:46:14.928
- Well, there's a song
about him in here, so...
- A song for everyone...

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.662
- But the guy who stuck around.
- Joel.

01:46:17.736 --> 01:46:19.966
Even moved out to this
ridiculous town...

01:46:20.039 --> 01:46:22.269
that doesn't deserve
to be called a city.

01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:24.400
Joel, let's go to work, okay?

01:46:24.476 --> 01:46:27.104
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay.

01:46:27.179 --> 01:46:30.945
You guys, that was great.
That was great.

01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:43.651
Okay, here we go.
Let's try one.

01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:45.788
