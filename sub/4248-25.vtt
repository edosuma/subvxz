12:24.910 --> 12:26.996
THIS IS EVEN WORSE
THAN DOWNSTAIRS.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.832
- WHAT A MESS.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.250
- THE ELIXIR'S GONE.

12:31.333 --> 12:31.876
- NO.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.502
- THE PHOTOS TOO.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.503
- ALL OUR PROOF.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.629
- FABIAN, QUICK.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.506
THE PUZZLE PIECES.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.097
-<i> DEO GRATIAS,</i> VICTOR.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.348
- THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.809
- HOW COULD IT BE?

12:48.893 --> 12:49.810
WHO COULD'VE LOCKED IT?

12:49.894 --> 12:50.978
- HAVE ANY OF THE STUDENTS

12:51.061 --> 12:52.313
BEEN IN THE OFFICE THIS EVENING?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.899
- FABIAN AND NINA CAME IN
TO USE MY TELEPHONE

12:54.982 --> 12:55.941
TO ORDER THE TAKEOUT.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.401
- I SMELL A RAT.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.737
- OH, DON'T TELL ME
WE'VE GOT RATS AS WELL AS MICE.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.738
- WHERE ARE THE STUDENTS NOW?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.990
- THEY'RE IN THE TEMPORARY BASE.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.492
- AT LEAST YOU HOPE
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.203
- WELL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:07.286 --> 13:08.204
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.622
THERE ARE RODENTS AT LARGE.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.373
- SORRY.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.708
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE JUST YET.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.752
- WHY NOT?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.295
- THE GIRLS ARE GETTING CHANGED
FOR BED.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.713
- OH, OF COURSE.

13:17.796 --> 13:18.881
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WE'LL JUST--

13:18.964 --> 13:20.216
- WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.426
- THEY'VE...

13:22.510 --> 13:23.844
GONE TO THE BATHROOM.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.888
YOU KNOW HOW BOYS ARE,

13:25.971 --> 13:28.224
ALWAYS GOING TO THE BATHROOM
IN GROUPS.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.725
- TRUDY.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.061
GO IN THERE
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.188
I'LL CHECK IN THE TOILETS.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.402
- LOOKS LIKE THAT PHONE CALL
CAME IN THE NICK OF TIME.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.697
- I KNOW.
LOOK AT THIS PANELING.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.242
- OKAY, WE NEED TO GO

13:46.325 --> 13:47.493
BEFORE THEY REALIZE
WE'RE MISSING.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.577
- YEAH.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.794
- WHAT'S TAKING HER SO LONG,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE?

13:56.877 --> 13:57.836
- OOH!
- OH.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.255
- [laughs]

13:59.338 --> 14:00.673
- WHAT'S THAT?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.716
- IT'S TURNING INTO
A RIGHT PAJAMA PARTY IN THERE.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.718
AMBER'S GIVING EVERYONE FACIALS.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.179
THIS IS A LIME SOUFFLE.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.597
- OUT OF MY WAY.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.518
- YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
THAT GREEN GUNK ON MY FACE.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.936
I'LL LOOK LIKE
THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.271
- SEE, I WAS GONNA SAY SHREK.

14:15.354 --> 14:15.980
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.690
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.527
YOU.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.445
WHERE ARE NINA AND FABIAN?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.116
THEY HAVE GONE BACK
TO THE HOUSE, HAVEN'T THEY?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.158
WE'VE BEEN TRICKED.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.332
- WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

14:35.416 --> 14:36.166
YOU'RE UNDER STRICT ORDERS

14:36.250 --> 14:38.627
TO STAY IN THE TEMPORARY BASE.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.378
- WE GOT A CALL
FROM THE DELIVERY GUY,

14:39.461 --> 14:41.505
HENCE THE DELIVERY.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.007
- YEAH, WE HEARD
HE WAS BY THE MAIN DOOR,

14:43.090 --> 14:44.008
SO WE WENT TO COLLECT.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.886
- I'M GOING BACK TO THE HOUSE.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.643
- I DON'T SUPPOSE EITHER OF YOU
TWO HAS THE KEY TO MY OFFICE.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.312
both: NO.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.230
- HMM.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.903
- HOW LUCKY WAS THAT WE
BUMPED INTO THE DELIVERY GUY?

15:04.987 --> 15:05.446
- OH, YES.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.906
- THANK YOU.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.659
- WELL, THIS MEAT LOVER'S
PIZZA'S NOT GONNA EAT ITSELF.

15:12.369 --> 15:12.911
COME TO DADDY.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.872
- ABOUT TIME, TOO.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.876
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

15:18.959 --> 15:19.543
- BUT VICTOR'S GOT
SOME OF OUR STUFF.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.961
- NOT THE PUZZLE PIECES.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.963
- NO, THE PUZZLE PIECES
ARE UNDER MY BED,

15:23.047 --> 15:25.674
AND THE CYLINDERS
ARE UNDER FABIAN'S BED.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.176
VICTOR'S ALREADY SEARCHED
OUR ROOMS,

15:27.259 --> 15:28.302
SO HE WON'T LOOK FOR THEM AGAIN.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.511
- NINA.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.348
I DIDN'T PUT THE CYLINDERS
UNDER MY BED.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.515
- YOU DIDN'T?

15:33.599 --> 15:34.600
- NO.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.018
THE BOX UNDER MY BED
IS SARAH'S BOX.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.811
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE CYLINDERS
IN YOUR BAG.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.145
- NO.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.190
- GREAT

15:41.273 --> 15:43.609
I THINK THEY'RE STILL
BEHIND THE PANEL.

15:54.078 --> 15:58.415
- OH, SARAH, SARAH, SARAH.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.210
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO
AND DIE ON ME

16:01.293 --> 16:03.629
JUST WHEN I'D FOUND YOU AGAIN?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.732
[wind blowing]

16:28.779 --> 16:31.949
WHAT'S THIS?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.285
WHAT IS THIS?

16:36.787 --> 16:40.624
[telephone rings]

16:40.708 --> 16:42.793
- AH, VICTOR.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.336
WELL, HAD THEY BEEN
IN THE HOUSE?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.588
- I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.965
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BE CERTAIN.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.758
- DID YOU FIND THE ANKH PIECES?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.093
- NO.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.347
THEY MAY HAVE HIDDEN THEM
SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.726
- IS THAT A CHILD I CAN HEAR?

16:58.809 --> 17:03.147
- IT'S AN EARLY RECORDING
OF SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.277
SHE THINKS MY LATE FATHER
KILLED HER PARENTS.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.945
- WELL, FROM WHAT
YOU'VE TOLD ME, VICTOR,

17:11.029 --> 17:13.574
HE WAS CERTAINLY
MORE THAN CAPABLE OF IT.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.535
- DO NOT DENIGRATE MY FATHER,
ERIC.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.119
REMEMBER, IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM,

17:18.203 --> 17:21.205
OUR SOCIETY
WOULD NOT EVEN EXIST.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.588
[snoring]

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
[fabric tearing]

17:35.596 --> 17:36.638
- WHAT?

17:36.722 --> 17:40.309
- OH, NOT AGAIN.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.978
- ALFIE.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.980
SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.909
- LOOK AT IT.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.535
- DID THEY SEND IN EXTERMINATORS

17:58.619 --> 18:00.704
OR A PACK OF ELEPHANTS
TO FIND THE MICE?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.122
- OH, NO.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.332
LOOK AT THIS.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.168
- THIS ALMOST AMOUNTS
TO CRIMINAL DAMAGE.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.253
- WELL, AS YOUR SCHOOL REP,
I'M NOT HAVING IT.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.756
I'M GOING TO HAVE A WORD
WITH SWEETIE.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.508
- GO, MARA.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.551
AND CAN YOU TELL HIM
TO GET IN CLEANERS?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.512
I CAN'T HAVE MY MANICURE
DEALING WITH THIS.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.722
- I FEEL REALLY MEAN WE CAN'T
TELL HER THE REAL REASON

18:18.806 --> 18:20.015
THIS PLACE HAS BEEN TRASHED.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.518
- THE LESS SHE KNOWS,
THE BETTER.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.685
- WE CAN'T PUT ANYONE ELSE
IN DANGER,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.813
AND TRUST ME, RIGHT NOW.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.064
WE'RE ALL IN DANGER.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.023
- WE ARE?

18:28.106 --> 18:28.982
- THINK ABOUT IT.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.859
NOW THEY DEFINITELY KNOW
WE KNOW.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.987
- AH, BUT WE KNOW THEY
DEFINITELY KNOW WE KNOW,

18:34.071 --> 18:36.532
SO THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WE KNOW

18:36.615 --> 18:38.492
THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING ON THEM,
RIGHT?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.077
- WHAT?

18:41.119 --> 18:42.454
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.206
- WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON THEM, AMBER.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.207
THAT'S THE POINT.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.083
VICTOR'S TAKEN ALL OF OUR PROOF.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.168
- WE'VE STILL GOT THE PIECES.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.420
- YEAH, BUT WITH NOWHERE SAFE
TO HIDE THEM.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.964
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING
A CLUB MEETING,

18:52.047 --> 18:54.049
THIS LUNCHTIME, OKAY?

18:54.132 --> 18:56.343
- AND THE PLACE LOOKS
AS IF WE'VE BEEN BURGLED,

18:56.426 --> 18:58.262
AND THERE ARE ITEMS DAMAGED,

18:58.345 --> 19:00.681
AND I REALLY FEEL
AS A SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVE,

19:00.764 --> 19:04.393
I SHOULD MAKE THE SCHOOL AWARE
OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.686
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, MARA.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.605
- I AM?
- YES.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.692
MAKE A LIST OF ANYTHING
THAT'S BEEN DAMAGED OR BROKEN,

19:11.775 --> 19:15.571
AND THE SCHOOL WILL PAY
FULL COMPENSATION.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.115
- OKAY.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.867
THAT WAS EASY.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.789
- WE NEED TO SPEAK TO VICTOR.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.250
THINGS HAVE GOT OUT OF HAND...

19:28.333 --> 19:29.209
YET AGAIN.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.550
- OKAY, SO THERE ARE
SEVEN PIECES HERE.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.760
I THINK WE SHOULD DIVIDE THEM UP
BETWEEN US FOR SAFETY.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.095
- GOOD IDEA.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.930
- FABIAN, YOU TAKE THOSE TWO.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.015
- CAN I HAVE THIS ONE?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.057
IT'S THE PRETTIEST.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.100
- IF YOU WANT.

19:45.183 --> 19:45.225
PATRICIA?

19:47.185 --> 19:48.604
- I'LL TAKE THIS ONE,
IF YOU LIKE.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.315
BIT OF AN AWKWARD SHAPE,
LIKE ME.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.525
- YEAH, SURE.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.861
I GUESS THAT LEAVES ME
WITH THESE TWO, THEN.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.616
SO LET'S SWEAR TO CARRY THESE
WITH US EVERYWHERE WE GO

20:00.699 --> 20:02.492
AND GUARD THEM WITH OUR LIVES.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.496
SIBUNA SWEAR?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.957
all: SIBUNA.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.879
- YOU WERE BRILLIANT
AS SCHOOL REP TODAY.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.255
- THANK YOU, AMBER.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.715
I'M HERE TO SERVE.

20:16.798 --> 20:21.470
- YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY CONVINCE
THE TEACHERS OF ANYTHING.

20:21.553 --> 20:25.140
- OH, THIS SEEMS TO BE GOING
SOMEWHERE BAD.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.643
- SO I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO GET THEM

20:27.726 --> 20:29.895
TO LET YOU ORGANIZE
AN END OF TERM PROM.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.939
- A PROM?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.441
- WELL, EVERY GUY HAS TO
TAKE A GIRL, RIGHT?

20:34.524 --> 20:36.735
AND THAT WAY
I'LL GET LOADS OF OFFERS

20:36.818 --> 20:39.196
AND HAVE AN EXCUSE
TO GO DRESS SHOPPING.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.117
THOUGH I DON'T NORMALLY
NEED AN EXCUSE.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.369
PLEASE?

20:45.452 --> 20:46.620
- OKAY.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.417
- ALFIE, COME ON,
WE'RE GONNA BE--

20:52.501 --> 20:53.502
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:53.585 --> 20:54.461
- NOTHING.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.505
- WHAT IS THAT?

20:56.588 --> 20:57.839
- JEROME, PUT IT BACK.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.800
- IS THIS ONE OF THEM?

20:59.883 --> 21:00.509
- NO.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.343
- IT IS, ISN'T IT?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.511
- DON'T LET ANYONE SEE IT.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.930
- I AM GONNA HAVE TO
BORROW THIS, ALFIE.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.391
BETTER LUCK ON THOSE REFLEXES
THE NEXT TIME, THOUGH, EH?

21:07.474 --> 21:08.684
- JEROME, PLEASE GIVE IT BACK.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.143
- I HAVE TO GIVE RUFUS
SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.895
HEY!
- YOU CAN'T.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.896
- STOP IT.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.481
I NEED IT.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.399
I'M SORRY, ALFIE.
