PENNYWORTH#109
"Alma Cogan"
Closed Captioned

00:10.923 --> 00:12.534
Will you come with me?

00:12.577 --> 00:14.797
To London? Both of you?

00:14.840 --> 00:15.841
Really?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.104
Well, I have a battle ahead.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.149
I'll need loyal friends.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.064
My God. James.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.805
Hello, Frances.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.025
UNDINE: Public rally?RIPPER: What can she say

00:25.068 --> 00:28.724
or do at a public rally that
warrants the risk of arrest?

00:28.767 --> 00:31.814
Lord James Harwood.

00:33.685 --> 00:34.991
Send in the heavy brigade.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.906
Arrest everyone.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.651
Stop!

00:42.694 --> 00:44.392
Harwood's a national sensation.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.915
A hero.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.395
Well, what are we
going to do, then?

00:47.438 --> 00:50.006
If the queen should
prove to be reluctant,

00:50.050 --> 00:52.182
then we will need to
find an alternative.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.184
We will need to find
a replacement.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.490
SERVANT:
Their Graces

00:55.533 --> 00:57.492
the Duke and Duchess
of Windermere.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.059
Ah.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.453
Welcome,
sir, ma'am.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.108
You knew who killed Esme,
and you covered it up.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.805
Protect my son,

01:06.849 --> 01:08.633
and I promise you
my vote.

01:08.677 --> 01:09.721
Count to three.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.115
Shoot him now.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.943
His father
has political clout.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.336
You know the rest.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.859
I just need
to raise my finger.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.382
Well, go ahead.
Raise your finger.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.036
Don't you...

01:20.080 --> 01:21.646
dare.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.734
My-my family will...

01:22.778 --> 01:24.954
Sorry, love.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.130
AZIZ:
I'm afraid this is gonna
create a lot of trouble.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.611
For all of us.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.931
DETECTIVE: No?ALFRED: No.

01:49.196 --> 01:52.068
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:52.112 --> 01:56.072
And this is your last chance
to answer truthfully.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.292
No more chances.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.511
Who was your accomplice

02:00.555 --> 02:04.124
in the unlawful killing
of John Curzon?

02:04.167 --> 02:06.909
Just give us a name.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.131
No.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.524
Alfred, I can't help you
if you won't help yourself.

02:13.568 --> 02:16.527
No offense, Mr. Aziz,
but your help

02:16.571 --> 02:18.790
hasn't been very helpful
so far, has it?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.270
You're not dead.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.142
I should say
that's jolly helpful.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.795
You were there.
You saw it.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
She saved my life
fair and square.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.888
A man can't grass on someone
who saved his life, now, can he?

02:29.932 --> 02:31.716
Fair play.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.458
Your sense of honor
is admirable.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.069
Your lust for vengeance,
on the other hand,

02:37.113 --> 02:39.594
might well bring down
the government.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.686
The PM wants you
buried alive.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.209
You're to have
no trial, no jury.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.168
You're to be thrown
in the dungeons and forgotten.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.909
You need a friend.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.303
I need a name.

02:53.347 --> 02:56.654
I did say I'd make trouble.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.613
Can't say I didn't warn you.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.832
Let him say goodbye
to his parents.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.183
Then take him downstairs
to be sentenced.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.228
What, they're here?

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
Since we took you in.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.373
I'm sorry, Mum.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.244
She knows you are, son.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.160
My poor baby.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.293
Not now, Mother.

03:26.336 --> 03:29.078
I'll be all right.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.907
Oh, dear.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.911
Everything's going wrong.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.393
What's to become of us?

03:39.436 --> 03:42.744
Mother, we agreed not to burden
the boy with our worries.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.268
Let him know we'll-we'll
be strong for him, eh?

03:45.312 --> 03:48.271
Yeah. Yeah.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.013
I'm sorry, love.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.494
Oh, don't say
sorry, Mum.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.936
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:
Seven years. Take him down.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.880
Morning.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.406
Who's in charge here?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.895
ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this broadcast

05:30.939 --> 05:34.072
for an announcement from
Her Majesty's Prime Minister.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.946
I spoke this morning with
Her Gracious Majesty the Queen.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.122
I informed her,
with deep regret,

05:40.165 --> 05:43.212
that my administration
no longer has the support

05:43.255 --> 05:45.388
of a majority in Parliament.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.042
That being so,

05:47.085 --> 05:49.218
she has granted me
interim powers

05:49.261 --> 05:51.394
to act as her prime minister

05:51.438 --> 05:55.703
until such time as
a general election can be held.

05:55.746 --> 05:59.402
In order to ensure
a truly democratic process,

05:59.446 --> 06:03.058
the election will be open
to all parties,

06:03.101 --> 06:05.974
including those that
have previously been illegal.

06:06.017 --> 06:10.761
All gag orders
are hereby rescinded.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.720
You may well ask,

06:12.763 --> 06:16.898
why allow these scoundrels
to emerge from their dark lairs?

06:16.941 --> 06:22.207
Because it is vitally important
we show the extremists

06:22.251 --> 06:24.035
in no uncertain terms

06:24.079 --> 06:27.952
that their violent radicalism
is not wanted here.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.390
Whether they be left
or right fanatics,

06:30.433 --> 06:32.479
their path can lead only

06:32.522 --> 06:35.873
to bloodshed and anarchy.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.440
On Election Day,

06:37.484 --> 06:40.051
do not give in
to the dark joys of chaos.

06:40.095 --> 06:44.795
Vote for your tried
and trusted traditional parties.

06:44.839 --> 06:48.538
Vote for stability and peace.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.627
That is all.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.413
I bid you good day.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.719
God save the queen,

06:55.763 --> 07:00.202
and may he have mercy on us all.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.856
Wow.ANNOUNCER: So there we have it,

07:01.899 --> 07:04.859
an announcement from
Her Majesty's Prime Minister...

07:04.902 --> 07:06.469
Finally.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.471
Oh, you think
that's good news?

07:08.515 --> 07:10.604
The people are going
to have their say.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.606
How is that
not good news?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.172
How?

07:14.216 --> 07:16.000
He's hoping the Ravens
and the No-Names

07:16.044 --> 07:18.002
will use their new freedom
to destroy each other.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.743
It might work.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.267
Or he may have just announced
the start of a civil war.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.445
Or maybe,
you cynical bastard,

07:25.488 --> 07:27.011
the people
will use their freedom

07:27.055 --> 07:28.926
to choose wisely and peacefully.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.537
Oh, come on.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.799
For such a sharp
backgammon player,

07:31.842 --> 07:33.148
you really are very naive.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.019
Suppose, just suppose,

07:35.063 --> 07:36.847
that Undine Thwaite
and the No-Name League

07:36.891 --> 07:39.284
actually get their message
across and they win.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.852
What if the people are actually
good, decent men and women

07:41.896 --> 07:43.201
and they soundly reject

07:43.245 --> 07:44.376
the Raven Society?

07:44.420 --> 07:45.856
What then with your cynicism?

07:45.900 --> 07:49.251
You know, sometimes I forget
you're a wacko idealist.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.559
A: Lord Harwood will not
accept defeat on any terms.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.778
He'll turn to violence.
And B: Do you really,

07:54.822 --> 07:56.650
truly believe that Undine
Thwaite and the No-Name League

07:56.693 --> 07:57.825
should be running this country?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.522
Why not?

07:59.566 --> 08:00.958
The CIA believes they should.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.264
Else why are you helping them?

08:02.307 --> 08:04.092
The CIA likes options.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.050
We're helping the
prime minister, too.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.791
We'd back the Ravens
if they'd have us.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.358
The CIA would let a chimpanzee

08:09.401 --> 08:10.925
run this country

08:10.968 --> 08:12.448
if it served
American interests.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.102
No, that's not true.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.930
I can assure
you it is.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.976
What, so the CIA would support
violent repression?

08:19.020 --> 08:21.501
Curfews?
Mandatory conscription?

08:21.544 --> 08:23.067
No, say what you like,

08:23.111 --> 08:24.808
but they wouldn't choose
a fascist dictatorship

08:24.852 --> 08:26.462
when there are other options.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.116
There are moral imperatives.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.509
There really aren't.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.206
Well, then that just proves

08:31.249 --> 08:33.817
that you government people
have dried-up little souls.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.558
Like raisins.Ouch.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.081
It doesn't prove
that the No-Name League

08:37.125 --> 08:38.735
couldn't run the country.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.433
I've met Undine Thwaite
several times.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.566
She's very intelligent and...

08:43.610 --> 08:46.090
capable and honest.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.531
Let's just agree to disagree,
shall we?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.445
How much did I lose
at backgammon?

08:53.489 --> 08:54.664
Â£250.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.667
Where are you going?Vacation's over.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.887
I have to get back to work
before the shit hits the fan.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.715
Really? That much? 250?

09:01.758 --> 09:03.630
Have to pay you back
when I next see you.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.849
Mm. You don't double enough.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.678
Listen, speaking
of back to work,

09:08.722 --> 09:10.550
count me in.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.290
I want to work.

09:12.334 --> 09:13.944
For government people
with dried-up souls?

09:13.988 --> 09:16.686
Well, I believe in what
the No-Names stand for.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.429
I believe in peace
and social justice.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.474
I don't care
why you're helping them.

09:22.518 --> 09:25.956
You are,
so I'm happy to help you.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.089
Okay, I'll give you a call.

09:28.132 --> 09:31.266
No. That sounded ominously
like "fuck off."

09:32.876 --> 09:34.835
Martha,

09:34.878 --> 09:36.663
I'm telling you
this as a friend.

09:36.706 --> 09:40.188
I don't for a moment
doubt your competence.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.756
But you don't know this world
and these people like I do.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.496
And, quite frankly,

09:44.540 --> 09:45.802
you're better off
not knowing.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.238
Things are going
to get pretty nasty.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.849
I'm not sure you
should be involved.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.459
That's exactly why you need...I can't stop you

09:50.502 --> 09:52.461
from working for
the No-Name League.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.289
I'm just saying,
think about it.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.465
Okay?

10:02.210 --> 10:03.167
Patronizing bastard.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.348
MAN :
A vote for the No-Name League

10:10.392 --> 10:12.568
is a vote for hope.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.441
A vote for equality.
A vote for love.

10:16.485 --> 10:19.314
Vote Undine Thwaite.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.708
Freedom to speak truth
to power.

10:21.751 --> 10:24.058
MAN: Get back here now!MAN 2: Stay where you are!

10:49.605 --> 10:51.302
I think you should
tell him.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.697
Oh, don't start again.
We agreed.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.525
Just doesn't feel right,
him not knowing.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.570
Well, it's my secret
to tell, love.

10:58.614 --> 11:01.051
And I'm not telling, all right?

11:01.095 --> 11:04.228
That's the end of it.
Come on.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.704
Oh.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.706
Welcome home, my love.

11:50.144 --> 11:54.191
Girls, this is my
darling wife Clarissa.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.717
Hello.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.067
Come along.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.987
Yeah.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.734
I like what you've
done with the place.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.736
TrÃ¨s chic.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.476
And you.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.522
You look fabulous.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.830
Positively blooming.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.573
Like a new woman.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.968
LADY HARWOOD:
Um,

12:32.012 --> 12:34.014
Jimmy, I...Hmm?

12:35.102 --> 12:37.191
May we speak alone?

12:37.234 --> 12:39.628
Oh, don't worry
about the girls.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.370
Any friend of mine is
a friend of theirs.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.111
Now...

12:44.154 --> 12:45.852
Tell me what's
on your mind.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.768
You seem troubled.
Unhappy, even.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.945
No, no, not at all.
I'm very happy. Very happy.

12:51.988 --> 12:55.775
It's just, uh...
you know,

12:55.818 --> 12:57.777
this is all so sudden.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.648
We'd given you up for dead.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.737
I... I feel like I'm dreaming.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.044
Hope that it's
a happy dream.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.437
Oh, of course a happy dream.

13:40.645 --> 13:43.387
MAN: Fresh meat.MAN 2: Lovely. Lovely.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.651
Ginger pubes.Lovely. Lovely.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.958
Get your eyes up.Lovely. Lovely.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.221
Lovely.Alfred Pennyworth?

13:54.921 --> 13:57.924
Mr. Pennyworth, sir. Visitor.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.628
Sandra. What are
you doing here?

14:11.372 --> 14:15.376
It's good to see you,
but you shouldn't have come.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.900
I'm not chasing you
or anything.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.381
Bazza and Daveboy sent me
with a message.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.557
They didn't want to show their
faces and rouse suspicions.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.775
Suspicions?

14:23.819 --> 14:24.907
Of what?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.604
They said to tell you

14:26.648 --> 14:29.999
to stay low and tight
and remember Rangoon.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.741
Ah, fuck.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.396
Okay, listen, Sandy.
Now, this is important.

14:35.439 --> 14:38.921
You go back to them
and tell 'em I said fucking no.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.401
No.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.490
Tell 'em I said
forget all about Rangoon.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.708
That is an order.

14:43.752 --> 14:44.927
All right?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.189
All right.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.759
"Rangoon" means "escape,"
doesn't it?

14:50.802 --> 14:53.283
Tell 'em I said they're children
to be discussing such bollocks.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.982
Don't you want to escape?

14:56.025 --> 14:57.853
Not at Rangoon odds.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.507
It was a bloodbath.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.772
Tell 'em don't worry.
I'll think of something.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.515
Will you?

15:07.558 --> 15:09.386
Course.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.388
I've been in worse shtook.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.260
It was politics
that got me in here,

15:13.303 --> 15:14.739
and they're changing
every day, so...

15:20.963 --> 15:23.966
How are they, anyway? The lads?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.229
They're worried about you.

15:26.273 --> 15:29.189
We're all worried
about you.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.453
Even me.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.851
I haven't treated you right,
Sandra.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.942
And I'm very sorry about that.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.031
I've been wanting to tell you
the cold, hard truth

15:45.074 --> 15:47.642
for a while,
but I put it off 'cause...

15:47.685 --> 15:50.210
well, 'cause it's cold and hard.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.561
What is?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.824
Bit obvious now,
isn't it?

15:55.867 --> 15:58.479
Stay away from the likes of me.

15:58.522 --> 16:02.048
Stay away from men that you
have to meet in Newgate.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.661
I should. I know.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.577
You deserve much, much better.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.275
I know what I deserve.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.278
Better than you do, I expect.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.586
Girl like you can have
anyone you want.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.022
Lords, if you like.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.071
I don't want a lord.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.898
Sandra,

16:26.942 --> 16:30.467
you're gonna forget about me,
and I'm gonna forget about you.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.123
Oy.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.997
Escort her to the outer door.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.347
Any screws mess about,
you use my name.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.175
Yes, sir,
Mr. Pennyworth.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.787
Goodbye, Sandra.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.370
Alfie says you're
fucking children.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.502
Forget Rangoon.
He'll think of something.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.461
That's an order.
Got it?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.377
Aye.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.960
I... Seriously, I think

17:29.004 --> 17:30.919
we should just lose
all this cake nonsense.

17:30.962 --> 17:34.053
This cake nonsense is
perfect. Remember...

17:34.096 --> 17:35.445
Yes, yes. I know.

17:35.489 --> 17:38.883
Just, I'm talking
to one person, face-to-face.

17:41.321 --> 17:45.281
MAN:
All right, we're on in
five, four, three...

17:47.109 --> 17:48.763
Good morning, everyone.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.895
I'm Undine Thwaite.

17:50.939 --> 17:55.030
I'm so glad I can finally
speak to you face-to-face.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.991
I thank the prime minister for
allowing us all to speak freely.

18:00.035 --> 18:04.431
Now, I'm new to this
speechmaking business, so, um,

18:04.474 --> 18:09.088
please forgive me if I simply do
my best to speak plainly to you,

18:09.131 --> 18:11.786
without any fine phrases.

18:11.829 --> 18:15.442
My dear husband Julian was
the talker in our family.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.096
My own political work,

18:17.139 --> 18:19.881
as for so many women,
was behind the scenes.

18:19.924 --> 18:23.232
Organizing, fund-raising,

18:23.276 --> 18:26.017
peacemaking.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.585
I'd still be happy
in the background today,

18:28.629 --> 18:33.764
had my husband not been
so cruelly taken from me.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.985
But I don't want to dwell
on the sorrows of the past.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.030
Let's talk about tomorrow.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.989
Let's talk about hope.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.686
Why not?

18:42.730 --> 18:44.601
Everyone deserves hope.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.994
And hope is what...

18:46.037 --> 18:47.735
My God, what utter tripe.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.128
Turn off the machine.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.695
Hope and love, equality...Well, well.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.436
I don't think we
have much to fear

18:53.480 --> 18:55.134
from the No-Name
contingent.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.399
Equality, indeed.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.531
Why not toast and jam?

19:01.575 --> 19:02.837
I liked her.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.143
I thought she seemed nice.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.448
No side to her.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.102
Well, she's standing
for prime minister.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.103
So, thankfully,

19:08.147 --> 19:09.844
nice has nothing to do with it.

19:09.887 --> 19:13.239
Oh, I'm sure you
know best.
Poor thing.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.720
Imagine, your husband murdered
right in front of you.

19:16.764 --> 19:21.029
And carrying on
the way she has.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.031
So brave.Mm.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.343
Welcome, Your Grace.

19:30.386 --> 19:33.215
Look here, Harwood.
It won't do, do you see?

19:33.259 --> 19:35.304
We have been
treated abominably.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.612
Cooped up like chickens,
chivvied hither and yon.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.092
Won't do.Secrecy, your safety...

19:41.136 --> 19:43.834
Bally rot.
Your woman here tells me

19:43.878 --> 19:46.446
I am not allowed--
not allowed--

19:46.489 --> 19:48.230
to call my tailor.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.146
We agreed, sir, no one must
know you're in the country.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.148
You must remain incognito
for the time being.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.064
There are limits, man.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.805
Limits.It won't do.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.286
I'll have him
sent for immediately.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.939
You must be exhausted.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.637
Perhaps you'd like to
see your quarters.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.596
Clarissa.Uh, Your Grace.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.606
GAUNT:
They're impossible, Jimmy.

20:16.650 --> 20:20.523
Vicious, stupid and cunning
in equal measure.

20:20.567 --> 20:24.135
Tools, Frances.
Implements.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.790
And now that we've got them
in our grasp,

20:26.834 --> 20:29.184
the queen will have
to do our bidding

20:29.228 --> 20:30.707
or risk replacement.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.448
Gin?

20:32.492 --> 20:35.582
Yes. Yes, yes, please.

20:35.625 --> 20:39.107
I saw that No-Name woman
on the machine.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.500
Undine Thwaite.Oh, yes.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.024
No, I saw her, too. Utter tosh.Yes, I agree.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.505
Bet and Peg liked her
immensely, though.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.594
Did they?Yes, they found her
simpatico.

20:47.637 --> 20:51.293
No side. Interesting, no?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.643
I know I shouldn't delve,
but I don't quite see

20:53.687 --> 20:56.603
what those Sykes sisters
are exactly for

20:56.646 --> 20:58.126
in the grand
scheme of things.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.823
You're absolutely right,
Frances.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.261
You shouldn't delve.
My point is that

21:02.304 --> 21:03.523
we're selling blood and iron,

21:03.566 --> 21:06.613
and Thwaite is selling
sponge cake!

21:09.398 --> 21:11.748
She may be a more
formidable opponent

21:11.792 --> 21:13.359
than I first anticipated.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.579
You've got a way

21:16.623 --> 21:18.668
of getting hold of her
quietly, I expect?

21:18.712 --> 21:21.454
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, I do.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.021
Give her a call. Tell her
we have mutual interests

21:24.065 --> 21:25.501
I'd like to discuss with her.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.373
Thank you.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.289
HARWOOD:
Perhaps we can make a pact.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.615
CHANCELLOR:
Regarding the, uh, items

21:52.659 --> 21:55.488
referred
to the plenary subcommittee

21:55.531 --> 21:58.186
on excise,

21:58.229 --> 22:02.756
an adjudication
will take place

22:02.799 --> 22:06.237
as and when the
addendum review panel

22:06.281 --> 22:08.718
issues its figures. Uh...

22:08.762 --> 22:11.939
Uh, and I would ask--
uh, I have asked

22:11.982 --> 22:13.941
that the cabinet ministers

22:13.984 --> 22:16.596
are in full...

22:16.639 --> 22:19.642
PRIME MINISTER:
A pact will kill us!

22:19.686 --> 22:21.252
Kill us!

22:21.296 --> 22:22.558
As you say, sir.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.344
I'd scrap the election
and call in the army,

22:25.387 --> 22:27.346
but, frankly,
I doubt their loyalty.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.609
I think they'd back Harwood.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.306
I hear the same thing.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.662
I'm getting old.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.144
I didn't see this coming.

22:53.459 --> 22:58.028
MAN: Mr. Pennyworth, sir,
you got a visitor.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.340
What do you want?

23:09.562 --> 23:13.130
I'm gratified to see you looking
so healthy in such squalor.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.176
Match fit.

23:19.093 --> 23:22.618
How would you like
to get out of here?

23:24.359 --> 23:25.926
Oh, don't sulk now.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.276
What do you say?

23:28.319 --> 23:30.757
I'm waiting for a question
worth answering.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.630
Are you willing to kill
to get out of here?

23:36.545 --> 23:38.417
Depends who and how many.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.551
May I sit down?

23:43.900 --> 23:47.991
The air in here is hell
on my allergies.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.777
Turmeric.

23:50.820 --> 23:54.171
Works wonders.

23:54.215 --> 23:57.392
The Ravens and
the No-Name League

23:57.436 --> 24:00.221
are secretly negotiating
an electoral pact.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.744
They'll divvy up seats

24:01.788 --> 24:04.138
to avoid directly
competing with each other.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.836
It's a lethal choke hold
on the traditional parties.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.492
The prime minister has decided
on heroic measures.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.451
Lord Harwood has to go.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.671
We'll make it seem the No-Name
League are responsible.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.412
Harwood.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.806
And the No-Name patsies.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.851
It's a just target.

24:21.895 --> 24:25.115
Harwood means to set up
a fascist dictatorship.

24:25.159 --> 24:28.336
He'll need a war.
Enemies.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.470
Scotland first, probably.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.168
Then who knows?

24:34.211 --> 24:36.475
You're working
for the good guys, Alfred.

24:38.999 --> 24:42.350
I do this, then I'm out.
No charges on me.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.439
Free and clear.Free and clear.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.572
Unless, of course,
for any reason you fail

24:46.615 --> 24:48.617
to complete your side
of the deal.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.750
Fair enough.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.144
Doesn't add up, though, does it?

24:54.188 --> 24:57.539
There's a high risk
of making Harwood a martyr.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.716
The Ravens could gain big
from his death at the polls.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.283
Your chiefs wouldn't
want him dead

25:02.326 --> 25:04.328
unless there was
some other threat in play.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.946
The Pretender and his wife
are in England.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.470
Harwood has them
under lock and key,

25:15.514 --> 25:18.125
ready to slap crowns
on the blighters.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.953
He also has a large faction

25:19.996 --> 25:22.303
of the army high command
on his side.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.523
They like wars, too.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.133
Why not just kill the duke?

25:26.176 --> 25:27.700
Not that I'm offering.No.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.876
One can't murder dukes.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.226
Not unless there's
no viable alternative.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.969
Now you know
everything. Um...

25:36.012 --> 25:38.928
I'll have word
with the warden, shall I?

26:06.173 --> 26:08.610
Oh, Alfie.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.493
Here you are.Thank you.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.367
Thank you.You're welcome.

26:28.369 --> 26:32.765
Now, going in
by the southeast gate...

26:32.808 --> 26:34.331
looks easier.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.726
Hmm. We'd have
to take out...

26:37.770 --> 26:40.642
the guardhouse first, though.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.863
Well, that's what I'm saying--
so we start here,

26:43.906 --> 26:48.171
make our way around
and through that gate.ALFRED: Hello, lads.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.173
Hatching a plan, are we?

26:50.217 --> 26:51.827
I thought you'd been told
about all that.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.438
What the fuck? Alfie.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.572
Hey. What the fuck?Hey.

26:58.878 --> 27:01.620
Alfred.
Bazza.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.666
Alfie.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.581
Come here.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.409
Oh...

27:08.452 --> 27:09.932
Told you I'd think
of something.

27:12.935 --> 27:16.286
GROUP:
âª My, my, my Hey! Hey-hey!

27:16.330 --> 27:18.114
âª Delilah

27:20.595 --> 27:23.467
âª Why, why, why

27:23.511 --> 27:26.383
âª Delilah?

27:27.602 --> 27:30.779
âª So before

27:30.823 --> 27:34.827
âª They come to break down
the door âª

27:34.870 --> 27:37.656
âª Forgive me, Delilah

27:37.699 --> 27:42.312
âª I just couldn't take
any more. âª

28:09.731 --> 28:12.952
So, how did you get out?

28:12.995 --> 28:16.216
Told you-- my friend Aziz
pulled strings.

28:16.259 --> 28:20.089
Oh. Seriously, now, what do
you have to do in return?

28:20.133 --> 28:22.048
Three guesses.

28:22.091 --> 28:23.614
Kill someone.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.442
Fuck, Alfie.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.836
Yeah, I know--
very depressing.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.621
Actors call it
typecasting.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.667
Who's the blot?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.756
That, you don't
need to know.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.237
Even if you're in on it,
names can wait.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.934
DAVEBOY:
No, we're in on it.

28:38.978 --> 28:41.720
Maybe. Don't know
the specs yet.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.374
No debate. We're in.

28:49.031 --> 28:49.989
Harwood.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.819
Ah. No problem.

28:53.862 --> 28:58.127
Just the most famous, if not the
most popular, man in England.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.389
Piece of cake.

28:59.433 --> 29:00.782
When?

29:00.826 --> 29:02.610
Aziz is gonna call
when it's on.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.917
What then?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.440
What then?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.790
You're in Babylon, Alfie.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.357
They won't let you go.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.620
They'll want you to
keep killing people.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.491
And you don't like
killing people.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.319
Yeah, I'll worry
about that after.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.887
You say you're in on the job,
then you get the collywobbles.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.063
Make your mind up.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.718
Harwood needs topping, anyway,
and I'm out of Newgate.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.067
That's good enough for me.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.243
What are you boys
whispering about?

29:27.287 --> 29:28.767
Dirty joke, Mrs. P.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.030
You'll have
already heard it.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.032
I dare say I have,
Mr. MacDougal.

29:33.075 --> 29:36.296
As long as you're
not talking mischief.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.167
I've got my baby back.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.343
I'm not letting him out
of my sight ever again.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.432
Oh...

29:42.476 --> 29:44.217
Right. Suppose you want
breakfast, dear.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.479
Oh, yes, please.

29:45.522 --> 29:46.828
All right, then.Please, yeah.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.438
Have a nice cup of tea.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.661
Nobody... nobody
sees this list.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.837
Understood.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.318
First list is the seats
we believe we can take

29:58.361 --> 30:00.711
if the Ravens agree
not to stand.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.932
Second list is the seats
we're willing to give to them.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.716
Both lists are ranked.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.850
Deal breakers first,
easy concessions last.

30:08.894 --> 30:12.506
We've entrusted you with
a great deal of responsibility.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.248
I won't let you down.

30:15.291 --> 30:19.556
If you don't mind my
asking, though, why me?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.123
Why not go yourselves?

30:21.167 --> 30:23.996
I can't be seen to
conspire with fascists.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.085
And I can't be seen.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.609
If it goes wrong,
you're a foreign freelancer.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.568
RIPPER:
We knew nothing.
Hmm.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.832
He'll try and intimidate you.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.790
Don't let him.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.879
But don't be
aggressive in return.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.795
UNDINE:
Emphasize our commitment
to peace, to dialogue.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.841
It's okay. They know me.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.364
Martha?

30:44.407 --> 30:46.932
Oh, it's so great
to see you again,

30:46.975 --> 30:48.324
Mrs. Thwaite.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.804
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.807
Undine, please.
We're old comrades.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.896
How are you?Very well.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.333
MARTHA:
I'm so excited
for the future.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.205
Your courage has been
an inspiration.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.816
Thank you.No, thank you, Martha,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.210
for all that you've
done for our cause.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.081
Now, did you two
come here together,

31:06.125 --> 31:07.866
or is this happy coincidence?

31:07.909 --> 31:10.433
Happy coincidence.
Hi, Thomas.

31:10.477 --> 31:11.913
Hi, Martha.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.915
Can I take
some pictures of you?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.221
Yes, of course.

31:19.703 --> 31:20.922
Good.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.839
That's great.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.930
Could you just look slightly
this way for... Yeah.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.671
That's beautiful.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.066
I have an idea.

31:34.109 --> 31:37.547
Thomas, you must take Martha
with you to the negotiations.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.420
I don't think that's a...

31:40.463 --> 31:42.813
That's not a good idea, is it?Why not?

31:42.857 --> 31:45.077
You've worked together before
with great success.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.774
I'm in. What are
the negotiations?

31:46.817 --> 31:49.124
Well, it's a technical,
analytical type of job.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.560
His Lordship likes women.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.648
All men like women.

31:51.692 --> 31:52.911
He'd be surprised, wouldn't he?

31:52.954 --> 31:54.738
Oh, boy.

31:54.782 --> 31:58.046
Most men.
A very high percentage.

31:58.090 --> 32:01.615
My point: a second negotiator
isn't necessary.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.486
A woman at the table

32:03.530 --> 32:06.750
signals calm, peaceful
intentions. It's a good idea.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.014
And who better than someone
we both know and trust?

32:09.057 --> 32:10.667
FLOOR MANAGER:
On the air in five.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.714
Right, must dash.
Lovely to see you, Martha.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.897
That was all
deliberate, wasn't it?

32:22.941 --> 32:25.726
You came here to do that.What are you talking about?

32:25.769 --> 32:27.380
I'm taking pictures.

32:27.423 --> 32:30.470
Oh, you came in very
smooth. Very natural.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.472
A five-star entry.

32:32.515 --> 32:35.692
She asked me, Thomas.
I didn't say shit.

32:35.736 --> 32:38.739
She asked me.That's because you're so smooth.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.393
What's the job?

32:40.436 --> 32:42.699
Uh, trust me, Martha,
as your friend.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.397
You're not meant
for this kind of work.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.485
You're just not.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.052
Well, Undine thinks
differently.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.749
What's the job?

32:50.620 --> 32:53.232
You'll know
when you need to know.

32:53.275 --> 32:57.018
I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning, early.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.812
Hmm.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.424
There you go.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.730
Handsome.

33:15.950 --> 33:18.735
That'll be the duke.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.346
Be a treasure.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.000
Send someone up
with toast and gin.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.218
Let Their Graces out.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.872
Will do.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.007
Oh, and, Peg?

33:29.050 --> 33:31.661
That meeting with the
No-Names tomorrow,

33:31.705 --> 33:34.577
I'd like you and Bet
to come along. Moral support.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.362
If you have no
other plans.

33:36.405 --> 33:40.018
No. Of course. Lovely.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.111
ANNOUNCER :
Regular programming will resume

33:46.154 --> 33:49.723
after this broadcast
by the Country Labour Party.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.333
MRS. PENNYWORTH:
Oh, fiddle.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.727
Another?

33:53.770 --> 33:57.252
Inbred yokels.

33:57.296 --> 34:00.255
All right, I'm off to bed.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.046
Night.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.221
Night, Dad.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.397
Night.Night, son.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.268
You must be
tired, too, Mum.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.053
Don't stay up
on my account.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.794
Oh. I'm full of beans, me.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.970
Just got to do this sleeve.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.669
It's you needs your sleep.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.453
Shall I make some cocoa?

34:24.497 --> 34:26.281
Good idea. Cocoa.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.856
Yeah?

34:35.899 --> 34:38.467
AZIZ :
The game's on. Tomorrow morning.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.513
Got it.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.737
I knew it.
What?

34:47.781 --> 34:49.522
More trouble.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.785
No, that was nothing, Mum.
It was a business thing.

34:51.828 --> 34:54.092
As if you could lie to me.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.746
No trouble, Mum. I swear.

34:58.792 --> 35:03.971
Please, Alfred,
whatever it is, don't do it.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.669
Well, I do have a
job on, as it goes.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.671
It's safe, though.
Government work.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.979
Nothing shady, I swear.Your dad's got cancer.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.199
He's dying.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.246
What?

35:22.598 --> 35:26.036
Your dad's got cancer.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.474
He's dying.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.695
Oh, Mum.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.137
I'm sorry, son.

35:43.576 --> 35:47.014
Doctors can do wonders
these days.

35:49.364 --> 35:54.195
It's terminal, they call it.

35:54.239 --> 35:57.111
Lungs.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.157
Two years if he's lucky.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.202
Christ.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.986
He doesn't want
anyone to know.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.510
You mustn't tell him
I've told you.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.033
But...No, you mustn't.

36:06.076 --> 36:09.210
He doesn't want any fuss.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.647
All right.

36:11.691 --> 36:15.260
Please be safe, Alfie,
for my sake.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.261
I will, Mum.You promise?

36:16.304 --> 36:17.305
I promise.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.851
Want me to drive?

36:41.895 --> 36:43.853
Nope.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.073
You gonna be like this
the whole time?

36:46.116 --> 36:48.162
Like what?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.772
Resentful.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.818
Yep.

36:55.865 --> 36:59.086
The American president
has announced his intention

36:59.129 --> 37:01.958
to put a man on the Moon.

37:02.002 --> 37:05.353
Goodness.

37:05.397 --> 37:09.270
Why, though? Did he do
something very terrible?

37:09.314 --> 37:11.141
Who?

37:11.185 --> 37:12.926
The man they're sending
to the Moon.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.797
No, Mother.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.234
No, I expect there'll be some

37:16.277 --> 37:21.064
brave volunteer who will be,
you know, selected.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.892
It's-it's not a punishment.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.154
Sounds like one.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.895
Who'd want to go
to the Moon?

37:27.767 --> 37:29.725
That's Bazza.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.771
Bye, Mum.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.778
Bye, Dad.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.043
Be careful, Alfie.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.612
Have you got a hanky?

37:46.655 --> 37:48.657
Yes, Mum.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.637
Blue squad.
F.O.B. up, over.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.204
AZIZ :
Roger. Stand by, blue squad.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.816
Blackbird incoming,
three to four minutes.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.513
Two Pigeons spotted en route,

38:18.557 --> 38:20.515
a man and a woman
in a white car.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.604
E.T.A. five to six.

38:22.648 --> 38:26.260
Confirming protocol, no action
until I say fire on target.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.132
Take out Blackbird first,
then the Pigeons.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.960
Confirmed. Over.

38:31.004 --> 38:34.312
Time for a brew-up?No. Five minutes.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.705
Blackbird first,
then the two Pigeons.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.055
Boy, girl, in a white car.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.883
No headshots on the Pigeons.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.712
They need them identifiable
as No-Name League agents,

38:43.756 --> 38:45.540
make for a good
cover story.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.369
Blackbird first,
no headshots on the Pigeons.Mm-hmm.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.067
This is the business, eh?

38:51.111 --> 38:56.246
Fresh air, high adventure.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.423
You boys should
embrace these moments.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.033
See, us?

39:00.076 --> 39:02.862
We're in the engine room
of fucking history, eh?

39:02.905 --> 39:05.952
Oily rags, Daveboy.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.562
Any movement?

39:07.606 --> 39:09.608
Negative.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.744
DAVEBOY:
Incoming. Blackbird.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.071
What's this, then?

39:38.114 --> 39:39.681
This is the place.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.335
This?

39:41.379 --> 39:44.120
We are at the crossroads
of ancient ley lines.

39:44.164 --> 39:46.296
A place of power.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.168
English rulers have been
coming here to do business

39:48.211 --> 39:49.778
for thousands of years.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.215
Well, there's...
there's no facilities.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.653
It'll look very well
in the history books.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.569
What, we're to pee in
the hedgerows, are we?

39:57.612 --> 39:59.527
It's a spooky place.

39:59.571 --> 40:03.139
I'm waiting in the car.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.446
DAVEBOY:
Eight armed guards,
two women.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.884
The redheaded woman
is returning to the cars.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.373
This looks like them now.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.206
DAVEBOY:
White car,

40:26.249 --> 40:27.425
inbound.

40:34.954 --> 40:39.088
Wind, east to west.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.177
Ten miles.

40:43.658 --> 40:46.313
AZIZ:
All targets inside our cordon.

40:46.356 --> 40:49.055
You are free to fire.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.239
Fuck.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.415
Fuck what?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.591
Who are they?

41:03.635 --> 41:06.507
It's that Thomas Wayne
and a tall drink.

41:06.551 --> 41:07.900
Martha Kane.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.336
Oh, fuck.

41:09.379 --> 41:10.859
Fuck what?

41:10.903 --> 41:13.079
They're targets,
and they're available.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.996
Thomas!

41:18.258 --> 41:19.825
AZIZ:
I repeat,

41:19.868 --> 41:22.262
all targets are now
inside our cordon.

41:22.305 --> 41:25.961
Do you have them in sight?
Blue squad, respond.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.485
It's good to meet at last,

41:27.528 --> 41:29.530
in so much happier
circumstances.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.792
Likewise.Ms. Kane, I don't think

41:30.836 --> 41:32.272
I've had the pleasure.No.

41:32.315 --> 41:33.491
Please.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.804
They're there for you, Alfie.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.937
ALFRED:
I can see that.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.592
You barely know the people.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.419
But I do know 'em.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.595
BAZZA:
Alfie.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.510
We have to say something
to Aziz.

41:53.859 --> 41:55.861
I'll have a word.

41:59.473 --> 42:02.607
Aziz, you tucked me up again.

42:02.650 --> 42:05.871
The Pigeons are Thomas Wayne
and Martha Kane. Over.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.570
Blue squad,
we had no information

42:09.614 --> 42:11.180
on the agents involved.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.487
Carry on exactly as ordered.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.924
The Pigeons have to go. Over.

42:15.968 --> 42:18.579
I'll have to think
about that. Over.

42:18.623 --> 42:22.365
Blue squad? Alfred? Respond!

42:22.409 --> 42:24.803
Fuck. Plan B. Go.

42:29.372 --> 42:32.245
I hate to say it, Alfie.
Daveboy's right.

42:32.288 --> 42:34.552
They're not civilians.
We're on business.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.945
On the queen's business.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.904
And those are queen's bullets.

42:38.947 --> 42:41.167
They're still fucking bullets.

42:42.429 --> 42:44.562
Oh. Movement.

42:45.606 --> 42:47.129
Police.

42:47.173 --> 42:49.610
Half a mile and closing.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.786
Aziz has given up on us.

42:51.830 --> 42:53.658
Gonna try and massacre them
all on his own.

42:53.701 --> 42:57.009
I'm sorry, boys, but there's
a principle at stake here.

42:57.052 --> 42:59.794
You're not gonna like this,
but I got to do it.

43:04.407 --> 43:06.061
Keep your head down!

43:07.585 --> 43:09.021
This way, sir.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.022
Get him out!

43:10.065 --> 43:11.066
Start the car!

43:17.116 --> 43:18.117
Keep your head down.

44:05.164 --> 44:06.774
AZIZ:
Stand down, Officers.

44:06.818 --> 44:08.733
Stand down.

44:17.698 --> 44:19.482
Well, that was
a crazy day.

44:19.526 --> 44:21.093
I told you not to come.

44:21.136 --> 44:22.834
Are you kidding me?

44:22.877 --> 44:25.140
I wouldn't have missed
that for the world.

44:25.184 --> 44:27.665
You nearly died.Yeah, that's just it.

44:27.708 --> 44:30.668
I nearly died,
but I didn't.

44:30.711 --> 44:32.713
Is there any better feeling?

44:32.757 --> 44:36.151
Well, I can think of several.

44:46.945 --> 44:49.034
Missed me by inches.

44:49.077 --> 44:50.775
Inches.

44:50.818 --> 44:53.560
In any case,
we managed to get away

44:53.603 --> 44:55.562
before the police closed in,
guns blazing.

44:55.605 --> 44:56.911
Was a damn close shave.

44:56.955 --> 44:58.304
Crikey.

44:58.347 --> 44:59.609
It's a good thing.

44:59.653 --> 45:01.350
We now know two new facts.

45:01.394 --> 45:02.700
We have a mole,

45:02.743 --> 45:05.050
and the government
means to kill me.

45:05.093 --> 45:06.573
The election's a sham.

45:06.616 --> 45:10.316
They'll never let us win,
except by force.

45:10.359 --> 45:11.839
And now we know.

45:11.883 --> 45:13.798
What are we going to do?

45:13.841 --> 45:16.365
The authorities could descend
on you at any moment,

45:16.409 --> 45:18.324
and what if they find
your wretched guests?

45:18.367 --> 45:20.718
Oh, damn it, Jimmy.
I said it was a mistake

45:20.761 --> 45:22.763
to let them come here
in the first place.

45:22.807 --> 45:24.112
You were
absolutely right,

45:24.156 --> 45:25.548
of course, as usual.

45:25.592 --> 45:28.160
We should never have
brought them here.

45:28.203 --> 45:29.857
Yet here they are.

45:29.901 --> 45:32.773
And our mole's no doubt blown
the gaff on them, too.

45:32.817 --> 45:34.644
God, of course.

45:34.688 --> 45:36.124
Now, don't be
downhearted, Franny.

45:36.168 --> 45:38.170
Yes, it's a pickle.

45:38.213 --> 45:40.781
Drastic measures are called for.

45:40.825 --> 45:42.740
And speed.

45:59.452 --> 46:03.499
âª Bring me sunshine

46:03.543 --> 46:06.894
âª In your smile

46:06.938 --> 46:10.768
âª Bring me laughter

46:10.811 --> 46:13.683
âª All the while

46:13.727 --> 46:17.470
âª In this world where we live

46:17.513 --> 46:21.691
âª There should be
more happiness âª

46:21.735 --> 46:25.783
âª So much joy you can give

46:25.826 --> 46:28.786
âª To each brand-new
bright tomorrow âª

46:28.829 --> 46:30.744
âª Make me happy...

46:31.876 --> 46:34.792
Oh. Hello, early bird.

46:36.010 --> 46:39.013
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

46:39.057 --> 46:41.320
Ooh, that milk's turning.

46:41.363 --> 46:42.712
Mum.

46:44.192 --> 46:47.326
That government job
I told you about...

46:47.369 --> 46:49.154
it went wrong.

46:49.197 --> 46:52.722
Oh, no.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.812
Did somebody die?

46:56.030 --> 46:58.206
No, Mum.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.034
That's the problem.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.312
Alfie.

47:18.879 --> 47:21.795
I'm sorry, Mum.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.145
I can't go back to Newgate.
I can't.

47:24.189 --> 47:27.845
No. You mustn't.

47:29.150 --> 47:32.762
You're doing the
right thing, son.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.199
I should go now.

47:34.242 --> 47:36.375
I shouldn't be here at all.

47:36.418 --> 47:38.943
Don't you want
to see your father?

47:42.076 --> 47:43.904
No. I can't.

47:43.948 --> 47:46.037
Look, just tell
him that I'm...

47:46.080 --> 47:47.386
You can't what?

47:47.429 --> 47:49.301
Tell me what?

47:49.344 --> 47:51.433
What's all this wailing, Mother?

47:51.477 --> 47:53.783
The police wanted him to do
a murder, and he wouldn't,

47:53.827 --> 47:55.350
so now they want him
back in Newgate,

47:55.394 --> 47:57.570
and he can't do that, so
he's going on the run.

47:57.613 --> 47:59.398
He's a fugitive.

47:59.441 --> 48:01.574
Oh, nonsense. What?

48:01.617 --> 48:03.881
Maybe the West Indies.

48:03.924 --> 48:06.884
Or America.Probably not, Mum.

48:06.927 --> 48:08.494
More likely just Wales.

48:08.537 --> 48:10.975
Just until the heat dies down.

48:11.018 --> 48:14.065
Look, I really have to go.

48:14.108 --> 48:17.807
Yeah.Bye, Mum. Love you.

48:17.851 --> 48:19.157
Wales?

48:19.200 --> 48:20.898
I really have
to go, Dad.

48:26.947 --> 48:28.906
I love you.

48:41.701 --> 48:45.183
âª Let your arms be as warm

48:45.226 --> 48:49.013
âª As the sun from up above

48:49.056 --> 48:52.233
âª Bring me fun,
bring me sunshine âª

48:52.277 --> 48:54.888
âª Bring me love

48:56.194 --> 49:00.372
âª Bring me fun,
bring me sunshine âª

49:00.415 --> 49:06.856
âª Bring me love.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.556
HARWOOD:
The prime minister
tried to kill me.

49:10.599 --> 49:14.473
Can you blame him?Not at all.

49:14.516 --> 49:17.215
I'd probably try the
same in his shoes.

49:17.258 --> 49:19.391
But he failed.

49:19.434 --> 49:22.568
And now the crisis is
here, and I must act.

49:22.611 --> 49:25.701
Either he goes or I do.

49:25.745 --> 49:29.618
He goes only if we say so.

49:29.662 --> 49:31.925
Who's a better friend
to the army, hmm?

49:31.969 --> 49:33.318
Who'll double your budgets?

49:33.361 --> 49:35.015
Who'll bring you
into the government?

49:35.059 --> 49:37.496
Who'll give you weapons
to fight with?

49:37.539 --> 49:40.020
Enemies to fight against?

49:40.064 --> 49:43.110
All salient points.

49:44.416 --> 49:47.071
You know we support
your agenda,

49:47.114 --> 49:49.987
but we answer
to the Crown.

49:50.030 --> 49:53.381
If the queen is with you,
then we are.

49:53.425 --> 49:55.340
If not...

49:56.732 --> 49:58.734
The queen is with me.

50:33.900 --> 50:35.423
Your Majesty.

50:44.128 --> 50:46.217
Deer can make that
noise sometimes.

51:07.934 --> 51:10.110
Oh, shit.

51:11.155 --> 51:12.547
Cry for help.

51:12.591 --> 51:14.462
Go on. Cry for help.

51:14.506 --> 51:16.421
GHILLIE:
Help.

51:17.639 --> 51:19.424
Yes, go help.

51:54.981 --> 51:57.636
Nice to meet you,
Your Majesty.

51:57.679 --> 52:00.117
Drop the gun.

52:00.160 --> 52:03.163
Drop the fucking gun!

52:20.920 --> 52:23.662
âª Get down, deeper and down

52:23.705 --> 52:26.230
âª Down, down, deeper and down

52:26.273 --> 52:28.710
âª Down, down
deeper and down âª

52:28.754 --> 52:31.365
âª Get down, deeper and down

52:31.409 --> 52:33.759
âª I want all

52:33.802 --> 52:36.892
âª The world to see

52:36.936 --> 52:41.897
âª To see you're laughing
and you're laughing at me âª

52:41.941 --> 52:46.902
âª I can take it all from you

52:46.946 --> 52:51.864
âª Again, again, again, again,
again, again, again âª

52:51.907 --> 52:53.213
âª And deeper and down

52:53.257 --> 52:55.737
âª Down, down, deeper and down

52:55.781 --> 52:58.392
âª Down, down,
deeper and down âª

52:58.436 --> 53:00.960
âª Down, down deeper and down

53:01.003 --> 53:03.354
âª Get down,
deeper and down. âª

53:06.966 --> 53:09.360
