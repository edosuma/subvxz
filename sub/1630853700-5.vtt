WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:06.571
- You should go home, Bodie.
Madison needs you.

00:06.615 --> 00:07.616
[heart beating]

00:07.659 --> 00:08.921
- That's our baby.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.140
- You doubled the cargo.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.621
You didn't care the straps
weren't secure.

00:12.664 --> 00:15.754
- And you walked away
without telling anyone.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.670
- I know what Jeremy is doing,
what he's bringing up here.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.978
- Alcohol is not illegal.
- Dealing Oxy is.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.940
- I'm sorry, I can't be
doing this, I have a fiancé.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.594
[panting]

00:33.772 --> 00:35.209
[door opening]

00:43.391 --> 00:45.741
[phone ringing]

00:45.784 --> 00:47.873
- You've reached Devon.
Please leave a message.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.049
- Emma?

00:53.053 --> 00:55.055
Are you leaving?

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
I thought we could...

00:57.144 --> 00:59.581
grab some dinner,
you know, to talk.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.671
- Chopper, I'm engaged,
remember?

01:02.714 --> 01:04.716
- Emma, come on.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.632
Don't you think that there's
something here...

01:07.676 --> 01:08.764
with us?

01:10.244 --> 01:12.072
- This was a mistake, Chopper.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.334
I'm sorry.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.732
- I'm so glad we're doing this.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.560
I've been wanting
to eat here forever.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.910
- Well, we never really had
a chance to celebrate.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.348
- The tadpole?
[chuckling]

01:27.391 --> 01:29.001
- I wanna do things right
this time, Mads.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.568
You know, ginger ale all around,

01:30.612 --> 01:31.874
you know,
bring the bottle to the table,

01:31.917 --> 01:33.397
on ice, the whole shebang.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.920
It's gonna be amazing.
[laughing]

01:34.964 --> 01:36.661
[man]: We'll need a deposit
on your credit card first.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.142
- What do you mean?
We haven't even ordered yet.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.578
We haven't even sat down.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.232
- And, if you pay
for your meal now,

01:42.276 --> 01:44.713
we can seat you.
It's restaurant policy.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.106
- Are you serious?!

01:47.324 --> 01:48.934
Screw your policy!

01:50.197 --> 01:52.982
- God, they just expect
everything for free, don't they?

01:54.897 --> 01:57.160
Bodie, for two!
- No.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.945
- Uh, what are you doing?

01:59.989 --> 02:02.296
Wait, what just happened?
Why are you leaving?

02:02.339 --> 02:03.949
- They won't serve
Indigenous people.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.082
- They didn't say they wouldn't
serve them, did they?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.171
I mean, I don't know,
it all happened so fast.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.957
- Madison, I told you,
my Mom's from Deep Lake.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.611
I'm Indigenous too.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.439
- Well, I didn't think
of it like that.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.875
- So, you forgot?

02:16.919 --> 02:20.227
- You're just Bodie to me.
We can go somewhere else.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.967
- I lost my appetite.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.200
- Sh...

02:38.332 --> 02:40.160
- Where are you going?

02:40.203 --> 02:42.988
- Uh, back to my room.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.208
I'll let you get some rest
in case we get a call.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.471
- Mm, rest is overrated.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.735
- You're the one who said
it was an amateur move

02:50.779 --> 02:52.911
to let a one night stand
spend the night, right?

02:55.523 --> 02:56.828
I mean,

02:56.872 --> 03:00.005
uh, y-you're great,

03:00.049 --> 03:03.008
but we don't really
know each other

03:03.052 --> 03:05.097
and we barely even speak
to each other outside of work.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.665
- So let's talk now.
What do you want to talk about?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.450
How about the sci-fi book
I've seen you read

03:09.493 --> 03:10.712
like three times?

03:10.755 --> 03:12.714
Or the country music
you like to hum, or--

03:12.757 --> 03:15.238
- Nowak, I...

03:15.282 --> 03:18.937
I-I don't really do... this.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.026
- Right.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.593
Why let someone in now?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.247
- What does that mean?

03:24.291 --> 03:25.509
- I don't know, you're the guy

03:25.553 --> 03:26.771
that everyone likes
and no one knows.

03:26.815 --> 03:27.903
- And you're an open book.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.385
- Who's Darius?

03:33.430 --> 03:35.606
You had a dream,
sounded intense.

03:37.086 --> 03:40.220
[pagers beeping]

03:44.311 --> 03:46.487
[intense music]

03:46.530 --> 03:48.315
[propellers whirring]

03:54.321 --> 03:57.367
- You may as well have
shot me in the heart.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.762
- Honestly, gun shot blast
to the glute is a lot better.

04:00.805 --> 04:03.112
You lost a fair amount of blood
but you're stable.

04:03.155 --> 04:07.203
- All I wanted was a quiet night
alone at the cabin by myself.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.900
- After you said you were going

04:08.944 --> 04:11.729
to a woman's business
conference. You lied!

04:11.773 --> 04:13.253
- Yeah, you followed me.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.732
How could you even think
I was cheating?

04:14.776 --> 04:16.647
- Because you lied!

04:16.691 --> 04:20.172
- Sometimes I just need some
alone time. Is that a crime?

04:20.216 --> 04:22.000
- Uh, shooting your husband
might be.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.133
- How was I supposed to know
that he was gonna show up

04:24.176 --> 04:27.702
at the cabin, in the dark,
and try to break in?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.225
It was an old shotgun,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.532
I was just gonna use it
to scare away whoever it was.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
I didn't even think
it was loaded.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.491
- What was I supposed to do?

04:34.535 --> 04:37.494
She's so secretive,
she's got so many walls.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.670
- So you literally broke in?

04:39.714 --> 04:41.324
I changed my mind,
I'm with you, girl.

04:41.368 --> 04:45.328
- You wouldn't be if you knew
about her girls trip to Vegas.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.721
There were Chippendales.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.853
- Okay, Robert.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.942
Time to top off
your pain medication.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.118
Get some sleep, huh?

04:53.858 --> 04:55.599
Lordy, Lordy.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.608
- Hey, Lex.
How's the weather up there?

05:04.652 --> 05:06.697
- All blue skies today, Dubs.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.918
Not quite so sunny down here?

05:09.961 --> 05:13.225
- Man, I see pallets
and manifests in my dreams now.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.315
- Hang in there.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.055
You'll go flightline soon.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.797
- Yo, Dubs,

05:19.841 --> 05:22.539
make sure this gets on that 420
up to North House, okay?

05:23.279 --> 05:24.628
- I didn't see it
on the manifest.

05:24.672 --> 05:25.847
- Forget the manifest.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.414
This was supposed to be
on the last sched

05:27.457 --> 05:30.112
but it got overlooked, so,
it's going up now, understand?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.810
- Yeah, alright.
[chuckles]

05:32.854 --> 05:34.334
- Don't question me, rook.

05:35.552 --> 05:36.858
[sighs]

05:39.687 --> 05:42.777
- Hey. You don't have to listen
to him if you don't want to.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.605
You don't have to do
anything unsafe.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.434
I lost a lot of sleep

05:47.477 --> 05:49.827
keeping quiet about this kind
of crap from Brad once before.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.003
- Yeah, I don't have
any bars here, Lex.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.744
So I just gotta put
in my time on the ramp

05:53.788 --> 05:55.224
if I wanna go flightline,

05:55.267 --> 05:57.313
and that means just staying on
dickhead's good side.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.362
[indistinct chatter]

06:02.405 --> 06:03.885
- No, I'm not gonna
change my mind.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.147
I'm not doing this.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.583
- You think you get
a choice here, huh?!

06:06.627 --> 06:08.498
Do you know who
you're messing with?

06:08.542 --> 06:10.108
Do you know
who these guys are?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.458
Don't be an idiot.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.850
Do your job!

06:14.896 --> 06:16.332
[sighs]

06:21.816 --> 06:24.384
- Does it owe you money or are
you just showing it who's boss?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.908
- Worried I named it after you?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.866
- No, no, no.
I know you love me.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.085
And survival training.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.435
- Thinking about skipping
this year,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.698
maybe go spend some time
in North House instead.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.221
- Is everything alright?

06:36.265 --> 06:37.484
Is it Isabelle?

06:39.355 --> 06:41.052
- Jeremy.
[Wheezer chuckles]

06:41.096 --> 06:43.185
- What's that little punk
up to now?

06:43.228 --> 06:45.448
- Smuggling Oxy.
- No!

06:47.319 --> 06:48.756
No way.

06:48.799 --> 06:49.974
- Officer Lee told me.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.715
- Come on, Crys...

06:51.759 --> 06:53.413
She's just trying
to rattle you.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.197
Everyone knows
that aviation authority

06:55.240 --> 06:56.590
was trying to pin
that crash on me.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.940
- She told me after
the investigation was closed.

07:00.245 --> 07:01.725
Wheeze...

07:01.769 --> 07:04.119
if he's bringing this shit
into the community...

07:04.989 --> 07:07.035
Into our home--
- Look, I don't know

07:07.078 --> 07:08.689
what Lee is angling at...

07:10.038 --> 07:11.779
But I know Jer.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.085
You guys have history,
but that's not him.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.655
Someday, you might want
to think about forgiving him.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.005
We're all idiots
when we're young.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.311
[pager beeping]

07:22.354 --> 07:24.226
- Got a call, gotta go.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.489
- Is it weird that I think
that you doing survival training

07:26.533 --> 07:27.708
is kind of hot?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.144
- Maybe misinformed?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.972
We're gonna be freezing
our butts off.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.364
- Warm you up when you get back.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.324
Patient is a 25-year-old male,

07:35.367 --> 07:37.195
hit by an unknown vehicle
that fled the scene.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.762
Northern Police are waiting
to talk to him.

07:38.806 --> 07:39.807
- What's his condition?

07:39.850 --> 07:41.025
- Pressure's stable,

07:41.069 --> 07:42.244
but there's a lot of
abdominal swelling.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.898
I don't see evidence
of internal bleed,

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
but I wanna send him
to Winnipeg for a CT

07:45.595 --> 07:47.771
and exploratory lap
in case things go south.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.167
- Jeremy?
- Dang, Crys.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.125
If I knew you'd be my nurse,
I would've got hit sooner.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.866
[chuckles]

07:55.910 --> 07:57.564
- So this is the famous
Jeremy, huh?

08:00.828 --> 08:02.569
- A witness saw
a dark-coloured truck

08:02.612 --> 08:04.614
speed away from the intersection
after you were hit.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.660
- Yeah, it was a truck.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.096
For sure.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.706
Or, I'm sorry,
it might have been a van.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.055
Sorry, it was a van.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.190
No, you know what?
It was definitely a golf cart.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.713
Sorry, it was a golf cart.
Write that down.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.149
- You really wanna do this?

08:18.193 --> 08:19.194
- Do what?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.325
- Deal with the consequences

08:20.369 --> 08:21.501
of lying to a cop.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.633
- Guess we'll have to wait,
constable.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.808
There's a medevac waiting

08:24.852 --> 08:25.983
to take this patient
to Winnipeg.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.813
- Someone's running contraband
up to the communities.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.467
And we both know who it is.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.861
Just like we both know

08:33.904 --> 08:36.124
the kind of message a hit
like this was supposed to send.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.040
These people are out
for your blood, Wood.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.522
But if you tell me what
you know, I can protect you.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.437
- This is my patient, constable.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.352
He needs urgent
medical care in Winnipeg

08:47.396 --> 08:49.006
and I won't let you
put him in jeopardy.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.574
So, if you're not gonna arrest
him, get the hell out of my way.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.489
- Mr. Wood's transfer forms.

08:54.708 --> 08:55.839
Everything okay in here?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.275
- Yeah.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.325
[Crystal]: Why the hell
would you pull this?

09:03.368 --> 09:05.283
- Yeah, 'cause getting hit
by a car was my idea.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.415
So much fun.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.678
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

09:10.506 --> 09:12.029
I was just walking to get a sub

09:12.073 --> 09:14.162
and then some asshole
swerved out and hit me.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.556
I'm fine.
- This is serious, Jeremy.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.993
You're in my goddamn plane
being medevac'd.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.650
For real?

09:23.693 --> 09:25.173
- Crys...

09:33.616 --> 09:35.792
- I sure hope whatever's
in those black and yellow boxes

09:35.836 --> 09:37.228
is worth it.

09:43.757 --> 09:46.063
[suspenseful music]

10:11.785 --> 10:13.177
- Hey!

10:15.049 --> 10:16.572
You looking for me?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.182
- Nah, just about to head home.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.706
Have a good one, Brad.

10:27.322 --> 10:30.717
[Nowak]: Whoa! A call instead
of a text. Who's dying?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.066
- No one.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.285
I mean...

10:34.329 --> 10:36.766
if I knew something
about someone

10:36.810 --> 10:38.855
that the police
should maybe know--

10:38.899 --> 10:39.987
- Do it.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.600
Trust your gut, Lex. I talked
you out of it once before...

10:44.644 --> 10:45.906
I shouldn't have.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.299
- Thank you.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.997
- You got this, Lex.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.216
[phone beeps]

10:53.391 --> 10:55.785
- So, uh, what seems
to be the problem?

10:55.829 --> 10:57.308
- Heard you had some damage.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.660
And your vehicle matches
the description of a truck

11:00.703 --> 11:02.487
involved in a hit-and-run.

11:02.531 --> 11:06.187
- What, this? I hit a deer
about a couple of weeks ago.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.494
- Huh. A six-foot-tall deer
at the corner of Main and Birch?

11:10.278 --> 11:13.498
We have reason to believe that
this deer is a drug trafficker.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.805
Maybe whoever hit him is too.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.851
This gives me probable cause

11:17.894 --> 11:19.156
to take a look
inside your truck.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.071
- Oh, okay, okay, okay. Look.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.815
I had a beer, alright. Just one.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.904
The guy came out of nowhere.

11:27.948 --> 11:31.125
I was worried I was gonna smell
like alcohol so I drove home.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.171
And I know it was wrong, but...

11:34.215 --> 11:35.607
I panicked.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.742
Hey, listen. It's...

11:43.441 --> 11:46.618
I don't know anything
about any drugs, officer.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.186
- You're under arrest
for a hit-and-run.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.406
- Come on... Okay. Ugh.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.673
[tense music]

12:07.857 --> 12:10.686
[phone ringing]

12:11.252 --> 12:13.515
- Hey, babe.
- One more sleep.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.082
What time is your flight?

12:15.125 --> 12:17.258
I traded my last couple of hours
to come pick you up.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.391
- Bad news, Dev.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.089
I'm not gonna make it
home tomorrow.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.047
- But Emma, it's your week off.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.267
- I know, um...

12:26.310 --> 12:28.835
it's survival training
this weekend.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.053
It's mandatory.

12:30.967 --> 12:31.751
- Damn, babe.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.448
- I'll make it up to you.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.493
- You've been working so hard.
I'll tell you what.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.713
I'm gonna book you
the best hotel in Thompson

12:37.757 --> 12:39.149
for the rest of the week.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.499
Go pamper yourself.
Have a spa day.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.414
- Dev, you don't have
to do that.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.287
- Come on, let me spoil
my future wife.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.420
I gotta hustle for rounds.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.987
I'll send you the hotel deets.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.162
Love you.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.166
[phone beeps]

12:57.515 --> 12:59.779
[soft music]

13:15.229 --> 13:17.405
[propellers whirring]

13:17.448 --> 13:19.233
[adventurous music]

13:20.582 --> 13:25.239
- Your chances of surviving
a plane crash are 95.7 %.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.632
Trust me, I should know.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.374
But your chances of surviving
in the wilderness

13:30.418 --> 13:32.942
after that crash
are less than 25 %.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.684
You guys are gonna get broken up
into teams

13:35.727 --> 13:37.207
and set out in
different points in the woods

13:37.251 --> 13:38.948
with a set of coordinates.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.559
You guys are each gonna
get some tarp, a rope,

13:41.603 --> 13:44.084
an axe, a map and a compass.

13:44.127 --> 13:48.349
Cellphones, we cannot have
any of you guys tempted

13:48.392 --> 13:49.829
to take the easy way out.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.657
Now, your assignment
is to make camp for the night

13:52.701 --> 13:54.224
and then travel
to the rendezvous point

13:54.268 --> 13:55.617
by tomorrow afternoon.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.488
- Could we hurry this up
already?

13:57.532 --> 13:59.099
- What's the matter,
you can't wait to get lost

13:59.142 --> 14:00.361
trying to leave the airstrip?

14:00.404 --> 14:02.015
- I know you cadets like
to thump your chest,

14:02.058 --> 14:04.191
but it's not exactly
rocket science, Nowak.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.714
Not like bartending.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.150
[chuckles]

14:07.194 --> 14:08.891
- Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is?

14:08.935 --> 14:11.067
I betcha 100 bucks I get
to the coordinates first.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.939
- How about make it two?
- Two-fifty.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.331
- Five hundred.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.681
- Better get
your wallet out, Chodie.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.031
You know how to do that, right?

14:18.074 --> 14:19.336
That's how you solve
all your problems.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.121
- Say again?
- Alright, take it easy,

14:21.164 --> 14:22.557
Lord of the Flies.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.342
I get to make up the teams.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.344
- So, this'll be fun.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.826
Just 48 hours alone
together in the woods.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.654
Not talking.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.700
- We can cut across,

14:35.744 --> 14:37.572
get a head start and
beat Bodie to the rendezvous.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.097
- What's the deal
with you guys anyways?

14:41.141 --> 14:42.490
Why do you hate him so much?

14:43.317 --> 14:44.796
- He's a spoiled,
self-centred prick.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.320
- He's a confident,
friendly guy.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.104
- Is he? Or is he
just a rich kid

14:48.148 --> 14:50.933
whose parents think the sun
shines out of his asshole?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.630
You know how easy
it is to be a pilot

14:52.674 --> 14:54.415
when mommy and daddy
can buy your hours?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.547
- Look, if this is about
the bet, I'll pay the 500 bucks.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.462
- Make up your mind, man.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.682
Are we friends or am I just
someone you work with?

15:00.725 --> 15:02.510
- Is that what you want?

15:02.553 --> 15:03.380
To be friends?

15:03.424 --> 15:05.078
[sighs]

15:05.121 --> 15:06.514
- No.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.472
[footsteps receding]

15:09.560 --> 15:11.214
[Emma]: You know your way
around a fire.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.956
- I come from a long line
of Fire Keepers

15:14.000 --> 15:15.175
on my dad's side.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.916
He was Metis.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.962
Joking.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.052
Dad was Metis but my Kookum
has a wood stove.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.142
How are things
up in North House?

15:26.708 --> 15:28.536
Pretty quiet
at the nurse's station?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.668
- I mean, it's never quiet.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.106
- But it's not like when you
worked at St. Mike's?

15:33.149 --> 15:36.326
You're not dealing with gangs,
or gun violence,

15:36.370 --> 15:39.199
or... overdoses.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.853
- No. Not on my shifts.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.986
- The community did a lot
of work to make sure

15:44.030 --> 15:47.337
no drugs were coming up here,
but things slip in.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.167
- Hey, um, are there
that many bears out here?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.393
- Weren't you supposed
to have this week off?

16:02.744 --> 16:04.093
- I can't go home.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.705
I slept with Chopper.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.883
- I can't believe you let me
build this whole fire

16:11.927 --> 16:14.408
before you told me that.
- I feel terrible, Crys.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.237
Okay, I'm a terrible person!
I cheated on my fiance--

16:17.280 --> 16:19.848
- Hol-eh.Calm down.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.415
You're not a terrible person.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.548
- But what do I do?

16:25.549 --> 16:27.682
If I tell him,
it will break his heart.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.989
Crys, he's never
gonna forgive me.

16:31.729 --> 16:35.385
- You can't go into something
like this with secrets, Emma.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.691
It never works.

16:41.435 --> 16:45.004
So... Chopper.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.267
[laughing]

16:47.310 --> 16:48.659
Wow.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.444
- Pretty cool, huh?
[chuckles]

16:50.487 --> 16:53.577
Temperature drops, moisture
condenses onto the tarp,

16:53.621 --> 16:58.539
water drips into the hole
and voila, Perrier.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.844
- Cool.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.672
- Better handy
than handsome, right?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.022
- Or both.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.764
- Oh, uh...

17:08.288 --> 17:10.116
Listen, Hayley.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.944
I know that things
between you and Bodie...

17:14.294 --> 17:17.253
It's just, I'm kind of
into someone now.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.864
- Oh, what? Oh, God, no.
[chuckles]

17:19.908 --> 17:21.605
Um...

17:23.912 --> 17:24.869
Who's the lucky girl?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.569
- I have a thing for Emma.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.833
- Emma? Like, engaged Emma?

17:35.837 --> 17:37.621
- She doesn't want to marry him.

17:38.535 --> 17:39.710
She told me this herself.

17:40.711 --> 17:44.150
- That sounds... messy.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.024
- You know, I got married
when I was 21.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.940
I thought that that's
what people did.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.204
And it made my parents happy...

17:56.205 --> 17:59.208
because they wanted
me to be happy.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.866
Happily married engineer,
just like my Dad.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.259
[chuckles]

18:07.477 --> 18:08.870
- Do you miss being an engineer?

18:08.913 --> 18:10.741
- Not the way I'd miss flying.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.398
Sometimes I feel bad that
I don't miss my ex more either.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.360
- I guess we all want
to find something

18:20.403 --> 18:22.144
that feels like flying, huh?

18:23.711 --> 18:26.148
- Come on, man, it's too early.
This is dumb.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.584
We should just wait
until there's more light.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.108
- We gotta get ahead
while we can.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.022
- Dude, I'm not tripping around
in the dark with you.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.024
Best case scenario,
we only get lost.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.070
- You're just stalling
so your bestie Nowak

18:35.114 --> 18:36.202
beats us to the coordinates.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.725
- Are you kidding me right now?

18:37.768 --> 18:40.119
- You don't have to come
if you're gonna slow me down.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.298
[screaming]

18:45.341 --> 18:46.603
Shit!

18:49.998 --> 18:52.435
[tense music]

18:54.089 --> 18:55.699
- It took us an hour
to find you guys.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
- If we don't get it out,

18:57.223 --> 18:58.963
the pressure could cause
permanent nerve damage.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.791
- Or he could lose a leg.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.794
- This thing's ancient.
My Mooshum had one like this.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.796
Old and stubborn, just like him.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.885
- We need to depress
the springs.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.804
Can you step on this?

19:13.848 --> 19:15.284
- Sure.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.981
- Tristan, the other side.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.810
- Ah! Ah! Ugh...

19:19.854 --> 19:20.855
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

19:20.898 --> 19:21.899
- Nope.

19:22.639 --> 19:25.207
- That should hold it.
- Should?

19:25.251 --> 19:26.382
- Almost there, Bodie.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.472
- Okay, alright, ready?
On three.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.171
One, two, three.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.303
[grunts]

19:34.347 --> 19:37.437
- Now what?
Trap's still in there.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.134
- We're gonna have
to pull it open.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.875
[breathing heavily]

19:41.484 --> 19:43.747
- Like a Band-aid, right?

19:43.791 --> 19:46.620
- On my count. On three. Ready?

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
One. Two...

19:49.275 --> 19:51.668
[screaming]

19:51.712 --> 19:52.887
Three.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.323
- Just like a Band-aid.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.630
- Here, we need to wrap it.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.805
- Ah!

19:57.848 --> 19:59.241
- No one will be looking for us

19:59.285 --> 20:00.503
until we miss the rendezvous
this afternoon.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.852
- Yeah, that's hours from now.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.332
Bodie's leg can't
wait that long.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.595
- He can't walk. How are we
gonna get him out of here?

20:05.639 --> 20:07.641
[Bodie grunting]

20:07.684 --> 20:10.078
- Okay, listen, we need two...

20:10.121 --> 20:13.516
long, sturdy branches.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.214
Now. Quickly.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.349
- Hey. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.393 --> 20:23.613
Not really sure why he needs
to be shirtless right now

20:23.657 --> 20:24.788
but, you know.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.268
This one's good.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.446
Ugh, I just got stung
by a freaking wasp!

20:31.186 --> 20:33.232
- Yeah, they're real assholes
this time of year.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.454
- That's a good one.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.892
That'll do.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.287
Need your shirts too.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.692
- How much further?
- About half a mile.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.129
- This is not working. Stop.
Put him down.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.305
[grunting]

21:06.177 --> 21:08.876
Screw this, it'd be faster
to just carry him.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.747
- Sorry, Bodie.
- Nowak. No.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.271
[grunts]

21:15.404 --> 21:17.363
Nowak. God, I hate you.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.235
[whistling]

21:20.279 --> 21:21.715
[birds chirping]

21:22.759 --> 21:24.848
[Nowak]: Flash it up, Wheezer.
Got a patient.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.808
- Just a little further, Bodie.
Almost there.

21:27.851 --> 21:28.939
[Chopper]: Over here,
set him down.

21:31.246 --> 21:32.900
- Careful, Nowak, watch his leg.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.728
- I'll get the first aid kit
from the plane.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.947
- You owe me 500 bucks, Scrotie.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.340
Looks like I got here first.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.994
- Looks like a tie to me.

21:40.037 --> 21:42.126
- Bodie stepped in a bear trap,
he's got a nasty flesh wound.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.780
We need to get him
to a hospital.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.652
- We need to get this elevated.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.523
Easy. Ooh.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.704
- Emma, your finger
is really swollen.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.402
Your ring's cutting off
circulation.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.447
- No, no, it's fine.
I just need an icepack.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.057
- No, an icepack won't cut it.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.450
We need to relieve the pressure.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.886
- Maybe there's something
in here.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.801
[tools clanging]

22:07.717 --> 22:09.415
- No. No way.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.113
This is my engagement ring.
Devon would kill me.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.115
- Well, you're not gonna
have a finger to wear it on

22:14.158 --> 22:15.551
if we don't do something now.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.684
- I'm sorry.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.947
- I'll go find some cold packs.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.128
[sighs]

22:29.435 --> 22:31.567
[adventurous music]

22:34.353 --> 22:36.964
- Stitches, antibiotics,
tetanus shot.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.227
And at least 24 hours
off your feet.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.490
- You forgot morphine.
This thing kills.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.318
- I'll make sure you get
some of the good stuff

22:43.362 --> 22:44.885
before we stitch you back up.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.195
- Hey.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.284
About the other day
with Jeremy...

22:54.068 --> 22:55.286
Thank you.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.333
- I heard back
from Winnipeg Memorial.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.335
There's no indication
of a bleed.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.816
So, they're gonna transfer him
back up here tomorrow

23:02.859 --> 23:04.034
to continue with his recovery.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.167
- Okay.
- Crystal.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.125
Um...

23:08.169 --> 23:09.823
I like you.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.520
I like being with you.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.742
But if there's anything
that I'd have to worry about--

23:15.785 --> 23:17.091
- No, hey.

23:17.134 --> 23:20.137
He's part of my past.
That's all.

23:22.618 --> 23:26.492
This is what matters now. Okay?

23:38.504 --> 23:40.027
[Crystal]: Thanks for letting
me hitch a ride.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.420
- Yeah.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.596
It's nice of you to go
to Jeremy's place for him,

23:43.639 --> 23:45.598
grab some of his things.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.252
- Yeah. I'll have a look around,

23:48.296 --> 23:50.298
make sure everything's
as it should be.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.561
- I'm just glad I got
to have a shower

23:52.605 --> 23:54.389
before my shift started.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.565
Could have used a nap too,
though, after this morning.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.351
- Hey, there's something
down there.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.006
Looks like, uh,
some kind of signal.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.747
You want to bank right
to check it out?

24:13.843 --> 24:15.497
Dispatch, this is 922,

24:15.541 --> 24:18.674
we spotted an SOS
at 59.5260 degrees north,

24:18.718 --> 24:21.111
94.6269 degrees west.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.983
[dispatch]:
922, this is dispatch,

24:23.026 --> 24:24.680
carry on to North House.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.552
We'll alert authorities
in the area to check it out.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.684
- Someone's signalling
for our help.

24:28.728 --> 24:29.990
- Tell them we copy.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.429
- What's the schedevac?
- Um, patient on oxygen,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.605
going to Thompson
for the dentist. Root canal.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.782
- We called it in,
let them handle it.

24:39.826 --> 24:43.133
- Someone down there
is looking for our help, Nowak.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.613
Now.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.049
[sighs]

24:46.659 --> 24:48.051
Dispatch, this is 922,

24:48.095 --> 24:49.618
we are diverting to the runway
of Bear River

24:49.662 --> 24:51.054
to investigate the signal.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.014
[propellers whirring]

24:54.057 --> 24:55.755
[adventurous music]

24:56.843 --> 24:58.061
[Chopper]: A little bit further.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.194
- I don't see anything,
are you sure?

25:03.763 --> 25:04.851
- Up ahead.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.374
- Wait, is that a tent?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.637
- Hello? We saw your signal.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.641
[suspenseful music]

25:17.559 --> 25:19.561
[sombre music]

25:25.436 --> 25:27.526
No efforts to resuscitate.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.835
- Must have fallen,
broken a leg.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.924
Couldn't hike up for help.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.057
Looks like it's been here
a couple of months too.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.800
Coroner will have to confirm.
I'll get the body to the plane.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.585
- Patient's...
the deceased's ID.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.283
We found it with him,
Kyle Hebert, 41.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.458
- It's not a crime scene.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.373
Keep it with the effects
for the family,

25:49.417 --> 25:50.679
get it all to the coroner
in Thompson,

25:50.723 --> 25:52.463
I'll let them know
you're coming.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.553
- You okay?

25:54.596 --> 25:56.076
[ATV engine revving]

25:56.119 --> 25:57.556
- It's crazy to think
how many times

25:57.599 --> 25:59.035
we've been up there
and didn't see this.

25:59.079 --> 26:02.386
- Chopper, you know
how big it is up here.

26:02.430 --> 26:04.867
It's pretty impressive
that you saw this at all.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.183
Crystal's getting a bag
for his effects.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.625
[Emma]: Hey, Dev.
Thanks for booking me a hotel.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.888
I'll try again later.
[phone beeps]

26:31.807 --> 26:33.809
- Surprise!
[gasps]

26:33.853 --> 26:35.811
- Devon, what are you
doing here?

26:35.855 --> 26:38.509
- You couldn't come home,
I decided to come to you.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.905
I needed to see you, Babe.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.734
- You must have been up
for 48 hours.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.693
- Well, it's worth flying
2,000 miles

26:47.736 --> 26:48.998
to tell you I love you.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.870
- I have to tell you something.
- Me too.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.263
Can I go first? I just had
a lot of coffee on the plane.

26:58.268 --> 27:01.750
I know I haven't always been
supportive of you being up here.

27:02.272 --> 27:05.667
It's just, being apart is a lot
harder than I thought.

27:06.668 --> 27:10.367
So, if working up north
is important to you...

27:11.630 --> 27:14.633
Then when I finish med school
in the spring,

27:14.676 --> 27:16.373
I'll get a placement
up here too.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.855
Doesn't matter where we are.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.772
As long as we're together.

27:24.512 --> 27:27.515
I'm... sorry, babe, um,

27:27.558 --> 27:28.951
you wanted to say something.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.170
[sombre music]

27:30.213 --> 27:31.693
- Careful.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.305
How are your bandages,
do they need to be changed?

27:35.349 --> 27:37.090
- It's good, Mads.
- Are you sure?

27:37.133 --> 27:40.354
'Cause I can just--
- I'm fine, Mads, it's just...

27:41.007 --> 27:43.749
Come chill with me,
I'll be back at work tomorrow.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.054
- Okay.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.318
I got something for you.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.810
- What are these?

28:01.854 --> 28:04.900
- Moccasins. For the baby.

28:05.292 --> 28:08.208
I know you were upset
the other night.

28:08.251 --> 28:11.733
But I want you to know,
that stuff doesn't matter.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.301
It doesn't bother me, Bodie.

28:14.344 --> 28:17.783
- Is that your way of saying

28:17.826 --> 28:19.959
that you're okay
with me being Indigenous?

28:20.786 --> 28:23.876
- No. No.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.748
That came out wrong.
That's not what I meant.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.230
Bodie, I...

28:31.057 --> 28:33.712
- I'm gonna...

28:33.755 --> 28:35.104
I'm gonna go lay down.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.160
- Patient's a restaurant owner
in a lot of pain.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.816
He's a 55-year-old male
with recurrent kidney stones

28:50.859 --> 28:52.382
and he's not gonna
pass 'em on his own,

28:52.426 --> 28:55.995
he needs to get to Thompson
for further management.

28:56.473 --> 28:57.823
[Bodie]: Of course it's you.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.002
- Can't I just drive him
to Thompson?

29:03.045 --> 29:05.482
- That'll take hours.
He needs a hospital now.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.441
- Is there another nurse?

29:07.484 --> 29:09.225
- Why would you need
another nurse?

29:09.269 --> 29:11.010
You can talk to me,
I'm right here.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.186
- Yeah. What's the problem?

29:13.229 --> 29:14.404
- Don't threaten us.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.931
I don't feel safe with them.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.107
How do I know
she hasn't been drinking?

29:22.848 --> 29:24.632
- Listen, you can be racist,

29:24.675 --> 29:25.851
or you can go to the hospital.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.940
But you can't do both, okay?

29:41.910 --> 29:44.608
Is it bad that I'm kinda glad
kidney stones are painful?

29:44.652 --> 29:47.046
- Yeah, I've seen
that couple before.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.180
Took Maddie to their restaurant.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.096
- You okay?

29:55.663 --> 29:57.752
- They tried to make
an Indigenous couple pay upfront

29:57.796 --> 30:00.059
before they even
walked in the door.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.278
They didn't know that I was...

30:05.978 --> 30:07.501
Afterwards,

30:07.544 --> 30:09.546
Maddie, she gave me these...

30:11.200 --> 30:13.246
fake moccasins.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.557
You ever feel like
nobody sees you?

30:23.865 --> 30:25.388
- I see you, Bodie.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.959
People like that...

30:31.003 --> 30:33.832
they can only take our power
if we let them.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.923
What matters is how you see you.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.887
You should come feast
in North House sometime.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.890
Any auntie will tell you,
you're too skinny, cuz.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.675
[chuckles]
- Yeah.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.897
- Delmont's telling him now.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.987
I told him not to do it
on a job, you know how RJ gets.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.989
I heard yelling,
but it's gone all quiet.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.643
- Help! Help!

31:02.686 --> 31:04.601
[suspenseful music]

31:05.864 --> 31:07.909
[panting]

31:07.953 --> 31:09.389
Get help.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.482
- I'll get the stretcher.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.310
- Lexi's got it.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.014
- Delmont stabbed him.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.929
I thought he was a goner,
but then I saw that.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.017
- What happened?

31:29.061 --> 31:30.758
- A heck of a brawl,
it looks like,

31:30.801 --> 31:32.368
but near as I can gather,

31:32.412 --> 31:35.415
RJ hit him with a tire iron,
and Delmont stabbed his cousin.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.724
- Why is it doing that?

31:40.768 --> 31:43.858
- I think it may have pierced
his pericardium.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.295
- So all that twitching is his--
- His heart beating.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.688
- Is he gonna be okay?

31:47.731 --> 31:49.211
- Did he hit his head
when he fell?

31:49.255 --> 31:51.213
- I think he got knocked out.

31:51.257 --> 31:55.174
- Okay. We need to secure
this screw driver,

31:55.217 --> 31:56.915
it's keeping him alive.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.917
You can't have it move
or it'll hemorrhage.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.962
Nowak, I need help
with the jaw thrust

32:01.006 --> 32:02.703
so I can get this OBA in there.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.924
[suspenseful music]

32:16.238 --> 32:18.371
Bird, there's towels in my bag.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.981
I need you to roll
four of them for me.

32:20.025 --> 32:20.895
- Okay.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.771
- What I need you to do,
I need you to place two,

32:27.815 --> 32:29.730
just like this, this way.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.645
And then another two
on top, like that.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.168
Good, good job.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.214
Alright, bring it over here.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.086
Easy now,
we don't want it to jar.

32:38.608 --> 32:41.089
Alright, I'm gonna start
an IV on this patient

32:41.133 --> 32:43.178
and we're gonna check in
on the other one, it seems like

32:43.222 --> 32:45.050
he got beat up pretty bad.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.706
- Dispatch, we're gonna need
another unit out here,

32:49.750 --> 32:50.751
we've got a runner.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.057
- He's too hurt
to have gone far.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.667
You take the front,
I'll go around back?

32:53.710 --> 32:54.973
- If you get eyes on,
don't approach,

32:55.016 --> 32:56.365
I'll do the rest.

33:04.243 --> 33:07.072
- Okay, RJ,
time to get you out of here.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.511
Bird?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.034
Nowak?

33:15.254 --> 33:16.559
[distant metal clanging]

33:16.603 --> 33:18.909
[suspenseful music]

33:23.958 --> 33:25.786
Oh, no, he's gonna jump.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.936
[breathing heavily]

33:49.288 --> 33:51.159
Hey, Delmont.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.771
What you doin', buddy?

33:56.077 --> 33:57.905
- RJ's dead, isn't he?

33:57.948 --> 33:59.385
- No.
