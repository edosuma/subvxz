01:31.136 --> 01:33.955
Doc. Door!
Door!

01:38.115 --> 01:40.994
What the hell is that?
Door!

01:41.014 --> 01:43.013
Before ten.

01:46.933 --> 01:50.972
We found him on the beach. I think
he's got hypothermia or something.

01:51.072 --> 01:54.051
Well, stop thinking.
Get him into the consulting room.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.110
Careful.

02:08.888 --> 02:12.887
Do you know this man?
No, never seen him before.

02:12.907 --> 02:15.886
He were just lying there.
I thought he were dead.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.106
Is he dead?
No.

02:17.126 --> 02:19.965
Are you sure?
Go away.

02:28.004 --> 02:29.123
Hello?

02:30.064 --> 02:32.063
Can you hear me?

02:36.002 --> 02:38.881
Can you tell me your name?
Is everything all right?

02:39.122 --> 02:42.001
You ever seen this man before?

02:43.081 --> 02:46.080
No. Sorry.
Thirsty.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.979
Can you get him a drink of water?
I must get James dressed.

02:49.999 --> 02:52.038
Fine, I'll fetch you
a glass of water.

02:52.099 --> 02:55.038
Got to go now.
No, you don't.

02:55.878 --> 02:59.897
You stay there. You were found
unconscious on the beach.

02:59.917 --> 03:01.936
Can you tell me how that happened?

03:01.977 --> 03:04.916
Sorry, I've got to go up there.
Yes.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.935
You appear to be dehydrated.

03:11.075 --> 03:13.074
Drink this.

03:13.974 --> 03:16.893
And stay there while I get dressed.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.949
Morwenna!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.988
Morwenna!

03:47.987 --> 03:51.066
Al, what are you doing?
I'm moving in.

03:51.907 --> 03:55.026
It's a bit early. I wanted to
catch you before you went to work.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.905
It's not for hours.
You know it's quarter to eight?

03:58.965 --> 04:01.024
What? Oh, God.

04:05.004 --> 04:06.083
Morwenna?

04:06.983 --> 04:09.102
Can you tell me your name?
Robert.

04:10.863 --> 04:13.082
Full name?
Robert Campbell.

04:13.102 --> 04:15.101
Do you know where you are,
Mr Campbell?

04:15.902 --> 04:18.060
Cornwall.
More specifically?

04:19.060 --> 04:21.060
Portwenn.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.039
Are you Dr Ellingham?

04:24.060 --> 04:26.099
I am.
Are you registered at this practice?

04:26.859 --> 04:28.058
No. Not yet.

04:29.099 --> 04:33.937
Who's your GP? I don't have one.
I've been on the move.

04:37.057 --> 04:39.056
You were unconscious
when they found you.

04:39.077 --> 04:42.856
Has that happened before?
Not so far as I'm aware.

04:42.876 --> 04:44.875
I really have to go.

04:46.935 --> 04:48.974
Sit back now. Sit back.

04:50.894 --> 04:52.913
Breathe deeply.

04:52.934 --> 04:55.053
Do you feel light-headed?
I'm fine.

04:55.973 --> 04:57.972
Been a little tired, that's all.

04:58.093 --> 05:02.052
There's a world of difference
between being tired and passing out.

05:03.012 --> 05:06.011
Do you live here with your family?
That's not your concern.

05:07.071 --> 05:10.030
But there are
a few of you around here?

05:10.050 --> 05:13.869
Ellingham?
I'll take some blood now.

05:14.049 --> 05:18.008
When did you last eat something?
I had some breakfast.

05:18.928 --> 05:21.927
Yesterday.
Your blood-sugar levels could be
low.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.939
Who's that I can hear upstairs?

06:01.959 --> 06:04.918
Stop talking.
Your wife?

06:04.939 --> 06:07.078
Mother? Aunt?

06:09.838 --> 06:10.897
Be quiet.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.816
Take Mr Cornwall's details.
I'll be down in a minute.

06:16.836 --> 06:19.075
Take your time. I need a cup of tea.

06:19.856 --> 06:21.955
Right. Hold on a sec.

06:22.075 --> 06:27.893
Portwenn surgery.
 Oh, hello, how are you?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.933
No, I said how are you?

06:31.993 --> 06:34.952
I think you're meant
to rub it on your rash.

06:35.872 --> 06:37.931
Your rash.

06:37.952 --> 06:40.911
No, I don't suppose
it did taste very nice.

06:40.991 --> 06:42.990
Sorry, I won't be long, Mr -

06:43.071 --> 06:45.830
How rude.

06:45.850 --> 06:48.869
Yeah. No, I'm not coming round.

06:49.030 --> 06:51.909
Look. Yum, yum, yum.

06:51.929 --> 06:54.028
Morning.
Oh, Mike, hello.

06:54.048 --> 06:57.047
You're early.
I'm bang on time.

06:57.908 --> 06:59.907
Are you?

07:02.047 --> 07:05.066
Hello.
No, it's fine. I can manage.

07:05.986 --> 07:08.865
Hello, Doc.
Michael.

07:09.965 --> 07:14.004
So I thought we'd go
to Minnie's playtime at the library.

07:14.024 --> 07:16.023
I don't think that starts
till next week.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.043
It started last Monday.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.842
I don't want him
cooped up inside all day.

07:20.863 --> 07:24.842
We'll be on the beach later. Should
be good weather for sand castles.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.961
Put sun block. He'll need sun block.
Packed it. Factor 50.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.920
OK.
Come on, then, sonny Jim.

07:29.941 --> 07:33.840
It's James, actually.
And you'll be back at five, yeah?

07:33.860 --> 07:35.039
On the dot.
And you won't be late?

07:35.060 --> 07:36.919
No.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.939
Bye, my darling. See you later.

07:44.878 --> 07:46.937
See you all later.
Bye.

08:04.974 --> 08:08.873
You know that sign's there
for a reason? What could that be?

08:08.893 --> 08:12.032
To stop you from parking.
Not doing a very good job, then.

08:12.052 --> 08:15.911
If you don't to move your car,
I'll issue a fixed-penalty notice.

08:15.931 --> 08:18.830
Oh, I should just be two minutes.

08:18.851 --> 08:20.890
Really?
Absolutely.

08:20.910 --> 08:23.969
Seeing as it's you, Dr Ellingham.
Thank you so much.

08:30.888 --> 08:31.967
Ow!
Careful.

08:31.988 --> 08:34.027
Be quiet.
How long have you been in pain?

08:34.048 --> 08:36.827
It's been hurting all night
and all morning.

08:36.847 --> 08:40.866
I've been sick three times.
We had a meal at Bert's yesterday.

08:40.885 --> 08:42.924
Sunday lunch.
It tasted funny.

08:42.946 --> 08:45.825
What did you eat?
I had some fish.

08:45.845 --> 08:48.844
Sea bass, it said on the menu -
Not you. What did you eat?

08:48.905 --> 08:52.004
Roast chicken.
Do you think it's food poisoning?

08:52.844 --> 08:55.863
It's always a possibility.
I'd need to examine a stool sample.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.822
Can you provide me with one?
What's that?

08:58.842 --> 09:00.841
Poo-poo.
Mum!

09:00.862 --> 09:02.861
Not to worry.
I'll give you a container

09:02.882 --> 09:05.941
and the next time you go to
the lavatory put a small piece of...

09:05.961 --> 09:08.980
poo-poo in it
and let the receptionist have it.

09:44.933 --> 09:47.892
Mrs Wead just dropped this off.
She said Becky's ill,

09:47.912 --> 09:50.931
but can you read this and give
her the OK to start printing?

09:50.952 --> 09:54.931
I'll read it later. Becky wants
to hear back from you by lunchtime.

09:54.951 --> 09:58.850
Oh, does she?
Yeah, well, I'm just popping out.

09:58.870 --> 10:00.909
Everything OK?
Yeah, fine.

10:02.929 --> 10:06.008
And now another blue one on top.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.027
Oh, hello. You OK?

10:11.887 --> 10:14.886
Yeah, me. You?
Great.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.786
Yeah, we're having a lovely time,
ain't we?

10:17.866 --> 10:20.885
Hey, do you think
Mummy's checking up on us?

10:20.905 --> 10:24.944
No, no. I just had to pop back
for something.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.983
This looks fun.

10:28.964 --> 10:30.963
Shall we put this on the top?

10:30.983 --> 10:33.862
Shall we? Look.

10:33.983 --> 10:36.822
There.
Um...

10:37.782 --> 10:39.901
Louisa...
What?

10:41.981 --> 10:44.840
Well, it's blue on top.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.959
Does it matter?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.979
No.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.838
Well, yeah.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.878
Why?
Well, they're in order, aren't they?

10:56.978 --> 10:58.977
OK.

11:00.937 --> 11:02.876
Happy now?

11:02.897 --> 11:04.896
Yeah.

11:05.816 --> 11:08.855
OK. On with the red row.

11:14.854 --> 11:16.973
Ruth, please.

11:16.994 --> 11:19.953
Radio Portwenn has survived
many years without me.

11:19.973 --> 11:24.771
We've had letters, postcards
and email, would you believe?

11:24.932 --> 11:27.971
The listeners loved you.
Even so, I don't think

11:27.991 --> 11:31.910
psychiatric advice should be
dispensed in 60-second sound bites.

11:31.930 --> 11:36.928
But you do it so well -
with wit, warmth, compassion.

11:38.769 --> 11:41.928
And it's so rare to have
a proper expert in the studio.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.867
Most of the people know less than me
about their so-called speciality.

11:47.887 --> 11:50.826
The gardening guru
is allergic to soil.

11:50.846 --> 11:52.965
The newsreader is dyslexic.

11:53.886 --> 11:57.825
And there's no-one around here who
has a fraction of your expertise

11:57.845 --> 11:59.964
when it comes to dealing with
mental people.

12:00.884 --> 12:03.903
People with mental-health issues.
They need you.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.803
We all need you.
This is your chance to help us.

12:07.923 --> 12:09.982
You're putting me
in a very awkward position.

12:10.002 --> 12:12.961
I know. Is it working?

12:13.842 --> 12:15.801
Possibly.

12:33.897 --> 12:36.776
You lost something?
Those cups.

12:36.837 --> 12:38.956
With the saucers, bottom right.

12:40.956 --> 12:43.935
I hope you don't mind.
I moved things round a bit more.

12:46.815 --> 12:49.954
You might find the drawers
are a little different too. Sorry.

12:55.813 --> 12:57.872
It seems logical.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.951
You're OK with how I'm doing,
ain't you?

13:02.811 --> 13:06.810
I mean, if there's anything
you don't like, just tell me.

13:06.831 --> 13:09.830
No, I can have a cup of coffee now.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.949
Is Louisa all right?

13:12.969 --> 13:14.828
Yes.

13:14.849 --> 13:16.828
She had a cup of tea earlier.

13:16.988 --> 13:19.907
Your first patient's here, Doc.
All right.

13:20.748 --> 13:22.907
Morning.
Hello, Morwenna.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.846
Morwenna.

13:28.986 --> 13:30.985
Morwenna!

13:38.784 --> 13:40.863
Are you feeling better?
Not too bad, thanks.

13:40.983 --> 13:42.982
Is that the school newspaper?
Yeah.

13:43.843 --> 13:47.742
I haven't approved it yet.
You said you'd read it yesterday.

13:47.762 --> 13:49.801
But you didn't
and I couldn't wait any longer.

13:49.822 --> 13:52.861
Well, you should have done.
How many copies have you handed out?

13:52.881 --> 13:56.940
Loads. And I've delivered quite
a few to the shops, cafes, pubs.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.979
I told you I was going to.
After I've given my approval.

14:01.899 --> 14:05.758
Where did you get them printed?
I used my dad's photocopier.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.917
Becky, you're going to stop handing
these out until I've read it.

14:08.938 --> 14:11.737
But that's censorship!
Yes, it is.

14:11.757 --> 14:13.936
Now, pick up that box
and come with me.

14:14.956 --> 14:17.815
I'm very cross with you
cos you have not listened.

15:43.958 --> 15:46.857
So, how was your first night
without me, then?

15:46.877 --> 15:51.715
I can't lie, boy. I miss seeing
your toothbrush next to mine.

15:51.736 --> 15:54.715
Here, put that out
and go peel some potatoes.

15:54.876 --> 15:57.775
Oh. Yeah.
Here, have you seen this?

15:57.795 --> 16:00.714
What?
It's the Portwenn Junior Journal.

16:00.734 --> 16:02.813
I found a pile of them
on the steps this morning.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.793
There's a review of our restaurant.
Is it good?

16:05.813 --> 16:08.852
It's by a Becky Wead.
She says, er...

16:08.913 --> 16:12.892
"Roast chicken dinner
was the most disgusting meal

16:12.912 --> 16:15.731
I've ever had
the misfortune to consume."

16:15.751 --> 16:17.830
So, not good.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.850
It gets worse.

16:19.870 --> 16:23.889
"I was sick throughout the night
and all the next morning,

16:23.909 --> 16:26.888
poisoned by the unhygienic
food preparation."

16:26.909 --> 16:30.948
Poisoned? She can't say poisoned.
I think that's libel.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.747
Or is it slander?
Either way, it's bad for business.

16:36.727 --> 16:39.706
We need an apology and damages.

16:39.786 --> 16:43.765
Frankly, I'm surprised you allowed
this rubbish to be published.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.684
I didn't actually see the review
before it was printed.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.844
And I wouldn't have allowed it
into the paper if I had.

16:48.864 --> 16:51.843
Everything I wrote was true.
Food poisoning?

16:51.864 --> 16:56.782
That's what Doc Martin said.
You could have got it anywhere.

16:56.803 --> 16:59.882
You know, Mr Large and Mr Large

16:59.902 --> 17:02.781
have a business
that might suffer because of this.

17:02.801 --> 17:04.720
Good.
Good? Little -

17:04.741 --> 17:08.900
Leave this to me. Go back to class.
I'll have a word with you later.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.738
I'm not happy, Louisa.
I want a full retraction.

17:17.718 --> 17:20.676
I will sort this out, Bert.
Well, if you don't,

17:20.698 --> 17:22.916
your people
are going to hear from our people.

17:22.936 --> 17:26.816
We don't have any people.
Shut up.

17:28.856 --> 17:32.775
We could have pretended.
She knows we can't afford lawyers.

17:32.835 --> 17:36.774
Here, hang on a minute.
I think I know her.

17:37.734 --> 17:40.753
Do you?
Yeah. I'm sure I do.

17:41.893 --> 17:43.892
I'll see you later, boy.

17:45.892 --> 17:49.771
I'm going down the hill to get fish.
Could you get me a sausage?

17:49.891 --> 17:51.690
No.

17:51.711 --> 17:52.910
I'm out of Primidone.
I know.

17:52.931 --> 17:56.870
Did you get some more? No.
Till the chemist's is open again.

17:56.890 --> 17:59.829
Is Mrs Tishell back?
Someone else is running the place

17:59.849 --> 18:03.708
till she gets out.
I was going to go there tomorrow

18:03.729 --> 18:05.728
I'll go myself. Today.

18:06.768 --> 18:07.927
All right.

18:10.887 --> 18:14.726
Bert! Nice to see you
round these parts again...

18:14.746 --> 18:17.745
Jennifer.
Jenny. Right.

18:17.766 --> 18:22.684
That weekend in Polperro.
Penzance. And Penberth.

18:22.705 --> 18:24.784
Oh, yes.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.863
You should have kept in touch, Bert.

18:26.884 --> 18:30.683
I got married.
Yeah, so I heard.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.921
You can tell a lot about a person
from how they keep their shop.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.820
Everything here
is all over the place.

18:39.841 --> 18:43.760
You've changed a bit.
Bit more curvy.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.779
Ditto.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.879
If you need a hand moving into
the upstairs flat, my boy will help.

18:48.899 --> 18:52.658
Mrs Tishell told my agency
that it's private property.

18:52.678 --> 18:54.717
So I've rented a room
in the Crab and Lobster.

18:54.738 --> 18:57.677
Oh, that's a bit pricey.
I've got a place up the hill.

18:57.697 --> 19:00.776
It's a B&B. It's a lovely room.
Free at the moment.

19:00.797 --> 19:04.856
I don't know. The Crab can be noisy,
especially Saturday nights.

19:04.876 --> 19:07.835
It is a nice idea.
It is, isn't it?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.914
Oh, hello, Doc.
Jenny, this is Doc Martin.

19:11.674 --> 19:14.833
Doc Martin, this is our lovely
new pharmacist, Jenny Cardew.

19:15.694 --> 19:19.833
Yes. I need some provisions.
We're not serving till tomorrow.

19:20.733 --> 19:23.772
Oh, I'm sure Jenny can make
an exception for you, Doc.

19:23.792 --> 19:26.771
So am I.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.790
Right.

19:28.911 --> 19:33.849
Prednisone coming up.
Prednisone? Good God, woman.

19:33.870 --> 19:36.909
I have clearly written Primidone.

19:37.669 --> 19:39.768
Oh.
That could be fatal.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.868
Have you? Let's see.

19:42.868 --> 19:45.867
Well, it might help
if you wrote in capital letters.

19:46.667 --> 19:47.866
It might help
to get your eyes tested.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.686
I knew you two would hit it off.

19:50.846 --> 19:53.785
Hm. Right.

19:55.765 --> 19:58.884
Here, Doc. I need to talk to you
about Becky Wead.

19:58.905 --> 20:01.704
There's no time.
I have to buy an onion.

20:01.724 --> 20:03.843
Did you tell her
she got food poisoning from me?

20:03.863 --> 20:07.902
I can't discuss my patients with you.
Hang on! I need to sort this out.

20:08.862 --> 20:11.661
Oh...

20:13.721 --> 20:15.880
Pollock.
Hi.

20:15.901 --> 20:19.880
Sold out of everything else.
Say hello to Daddy. "Hello, Daddy."

20:20.860 --> 20:23.799
Becky Wead wrote a terrible review
of Bert's restaurant.

20:23.819 --> 20:26.678
Bert wants an apology.
It's a terrible restaurant.

20:26.699 --> 20:29.678
A terrible review seems appropriate.
It's not that bad.

20:29.698 --> 20:31.817
Although the chicken
wasn't very good, allegedly.

20:31.858 --> 20:35.657
It gave her food poisoning.
That's just a possibility.

20:35.677 --> 20:38.716
So it might not be Bert's fault?
I can't discuss my patients.

20:38.736 --> 20:43.714
I haven't had the test results back.
Even then, I can't discuss them.

20:43.735 --> 20:47.734
That's not much help, is it?
Louisa, you seem rather tense.

20:47.754 --> 20:49.833
Of course I'm tense.
You've no idea what it's like

20:49.854 --> 20:53.653
me leaving James with a stranger,
trying to work

20:53.673 --> 20:55.732
and counting the minutes
till I can get home.

20:55.773 --> 20:57.792
I told you
you went back to work too early.

20:57.812 --> 20:59.811
Don't start.

21:00.732 --> 21:03.731
To makes things worse, James
has decided he doesn't need food.

21:03.751 --> 21:05.790
Don't worry.
He ate an enormous breakfast

21:05.811 --> 21:09.670
followed by an even bigger lunch.
Oh.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.849
Well, good for Michael.

21:59.259 --> 22:01.298
Morning.
Shh.

22:02.259 --> 22:06.118
He should be awake now.
He had a bad night. So did we.

22:06.138 --> 22:07.277
Go through.

22:07.298 --> 22:11.197
The sooner you get him into
a routine, the better for everyone.

22:11.217 --> 22:13.336
Ruth, hi.
Hi.

22:15.256 --> 22:18.275
To what do we owe this pleasure?
I had half an hour to kill.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.154
I felt like a coffee

22:20.175 --> 22:23.194
and I thought you might like
to wish me a happy birthday.

22:23.214 --> 22:27.333
It's your birthday?
Ruth, happy birthday.

22:29.353 --> 22:33.152
What are you doing to celebrate?
What I always do.

22:33.172 --> 22:34.331
Absolutely nothing.

22:35.332 --> 22:37.191
Martin.
Hm?

22:37.211 --> 22:38.350
Um...

22:38.371 --> 22:41.210
Yes, I could take you to lunch.

22:41.291 --> 22:44.270
All right. Pick me up at 12:30.

22:44.290 --> 22:46.329
I'm busy all morning.
What are you doing?

22:46.350 --> 22:51.308
Broadcasting live on Radio Portwenn.
Oh, not that awful phone-in?

22:51.329 --> 22:55.208
No, Martin,
I'm reading the football results.

22:58.327 --> 23:01.166
I think she was joking.

23:02.246 --> 23:03.325
I see.

23:03.366 --> 23:07.105
'Followed by Ask The Gardener
with Gordon Spelling,

23:07.125 --> 23:09.304
who is back from sick leave
and raring to go.'

23:09.325 --> 23:13.304
'But next on Radio Portwenn, it's
the return of Dr Ruth Ellingham,

23:13.324 --> 23:17.163
who will be offering advice
to anyone who needs it.'

23:20.162 --> 23:22.241
Louisa! Louisa!

23:23.282 --> 23:26.201
Do you want to walk together?
I'd love to, but I'm late.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.260
I've got to get a move on.
Oh, bye-bye, darling.

23:29.281 --> 23:33.160
Bye-bye, sweetie. See you later.
Bye.

23:33.180 --> 23:36.179
What have you done about
that newspaper? I haven't had time.

23:36.199 --> 23:39.298
Meanwhile, anyone that visits
Portwenn can read that my restaurant

23:39.318 --> 23:42.297
is not safe to eat in.
Have your bookings gone down?

23:42.318 --> 23:46.197
They've not gone up.
And that newspaper's full of lies.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.136
It's actually libel.
Then do something about it!

23:49.156 --> 23:53.195
I don't have any time, Bert.
And I don't have any customers!

23:53.216 --> 23:55.155
You never did, Bert!

23:58.115 --> 24:02.274
'I mean, what's the point? I feel
like life's not worth living.'

24:02.294 --> 24:06.193
'What's there to look forward to?'
Oh, come on, Sheila.

24:06.213 --> 24:09.172
There's plenty of things
to look forward to.

24:09.192 --> 24:13.231
There's the Steam Fair,
there's the Flower Show,

24:13.251 --> 24:15.350
and the Portwenn musical players

24:16.111 --> 24:18.330
are giving us their Oklahoma
next month.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.209
Hello?

24:23.189 --> 24:26.228
I'm afraid we've lost Sheila.
So let's try our next caller.

24:26.329 --> 24:28.348
Perhaps I should speak to this one.

24:29.248 --> 24:33.087
Of course, Dr Ruth.
Dr Ellingham, please.

24:33.107 --> 24:36.286
'Hello, Dr Ellingham.
Can you hear me?'

24:36.307 --> 24:40.086
Yes, she can. What -
What's your name?

24:40.106 --> 24:43.165
'Call me Bob.'
And what's your problem, Bob?

24:44.185 --> 24:47.124
There's a woman.
'Isn't there always?'

24:47.144 --> 24:50.143
I've known her for years.
She means everything to me,

24:50.164 --> 24:55.162
and I wanted - 'I have nothing
to say about affairs of the heart.'

24:55.183 --> 24:57.282
Not that we're trying
to get rid of you.

24:57.302 --> 25:03.100
Yes, we are. I'm sure Dr Ruth
would like to offer some advice.

25:03.181 --> 25:06.320
Advice is like snow.

25:06.340 --> 25:11.198
The softer it falls,
the longer it dwells upon.

25:11.319 --> 25:14.238
'And the deeper
it sinks into the mind.'

25:14.339 --> 25:17.258
'I can't remember who said that.'

25:19.318 --> 25:21.317
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

25:24.257 --> 25:27.136
Well, Bob,

25:27.156 --> 25:33.134
I suppose if I had to, I'd suggest
that you speak to this woman.

25:33.215 --> 25:35.254
'Tell her how you feel.'

25:35.274 --> 25:37.173
Face to face?

25:37.194 --> 25:41.253
That's always best.
And she will feel the same about me?

25:43.213 --> 25:45.132
'She will love me?'

25:45.212 --> 25:51.110
I can see Dr Ruth nodding her head.
Who do we have on line three?

25:51.131 --> 25:53.330
Oh. Hello, Bethany.
'Can you hear me?'

25:54.090 --> 25:58.089
Spit it all out, Beth.

26:03.088 --> 26:04.307
There's no doubt you have an ulcer.

26:04.328 --> 26:07.307
The only question is whether
it's gastric or duodenal.

26:08.287 --> 26:11.266
You said it was food poisoning.
No, I didn't.

26:12.287 --> 26:15.186
I'll make an appointment
for you to have an endoscopy.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.185
You agreed it was
because of the chicken.

26:18.205 --> 26:21.104
No, I didn't.
Tell him, Mum.

26:21.125 --> 26:25.284
I think you did actually mention
the possibility that it could be.

26:25.304 --> 26:29.323
The possibility, yes, but not the
certainty or even the probability.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.262
Do you know the difference?
Don't talk to my mum like that.

26:32.282 --> 26:35.101
I'll talk how I want.
It's my surgery.

26:35.122 --> 26:39.141
The tests on your faeces
rule out food poisoning.

26:39.161 --> 26:43.140
Is there any part of that sentence
either of you is struggling with?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.219
Good. Take this and go away.

27:06.075 --> 27:07.274
Oh!

27:08.295 --> 27:10.214
Oh, you gave me a shock.

27:10.294 --> 27:14.133
Why? You knew I was coming.
Well, yes, I did.

27:15.213 --> 27:17.272
Thanks for the cake.

27:18.153 --> 27:20.232
That's nothing to do with me.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.191
I don't like cake.

27:23.192 --> 27:25.191
Come on.

27:27.191 --> 27:30.050
So, someone's been in the house.

27:30.070 --> 27:33.129
Perhaps it's one of your friends.
I don't have friends in Cornwall.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.249
And who'd know it's my birthday?
I don't know.

27:35.269 --> 27:39.208
Maybe you announced it on the radio.
You heard my programme?

27:39.228 --> 27:44.126
Of course not.
I made no announcement on the radio.

27:44.147 --> 27:47.166
It's not uncommon to experience
memory lapses at your age.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.246
Perhaps you told a neighbour
and then forgot.

27:49.266 --> 27:52.265
Well, happy birthday to me.

28:28.098 --> 28:30.177
PC Joseph Penhale. 3021.

28:32.257 --> 28:36.236
Is it a matter of life and death?
I am on my refreshment break.

28:39.056 --> 28:43.275
Sorry, but is it vital that you get
through that gate right now?

28:45.055 --> 28:48.054
I don't think it's appropriate
to speak to an officer of the law

28:48.074 --> 28:49.213
in that manner.

28:49.294 --> 28:52.293
If you repeat that threat,
I could actually arrest you.

29:03.211 --> 29:06.250
I hope you're not driving anywhere.
I hadn't planned to.

29:07.130 --> 29:09.129
Good.

29:10.289 --> 29:12.268
Perhaps I have a secret admirer.

29:13.209 --> 29:16.188
Is that a realistic proposition?
You seem not to think so.

29:16.288 --> 29:21.166
However, a red rose is
a classic symbol of romantic love

29:21.187 --> 29:23.206
and one appeared on my car
the other day.

29:24.166 --> 29:27.225
It's just possible
I have a rather amorous stalker.

29:28.066 --> 29:31.265
That's just wishful thinking.
Oh, Martin, you know very well

29:31.285 --> 29:35.164
people are surprisingly eclectic
in their sexual inclinations.

29:35.184 --> 29:38.143
Eclectic? That's one word for it.

29:38.164 --> 29:41.083
Want me to come around tonight?
I don't.

29:47.082 --> 29:50.221
You haven't touched your fish.
Uh, no.

29:50.241 --> 29:52.240
Something wrong?
No, I'm fine.

29:53.140 --> 29:55.179
Martin...

29:55.200 --> 29:57.179
I'm fine.

29:57.200 --> 30:01.079
Possibly a slight problem with blood.

30:02.039 --> 30:04.058
Haemophobia?

30:04.078 --> 30:06.237
I'm sure it's nothing.
It'll disappear again.

30:07.117 --> 30:09.076
And if it doesn't?

30:10.177 --> 30:13.236
I have a name. Names.
People you can talk to.

30:15.196 --> 30:18.095
I'm sure it'll go.

30:18.235 --> 30:20.234
Possibly.

30:41.250 --> 30:43.249
Stay back.

31:16.103 --> 31:18.262
Yeah, two o'clock tomorrow.
Next patient.

31:19.022 --> 31:21.141
Message from Truro hospital.

31:21.162 --> 31:23.161
Doc, it's my leg.
It's acting up again.

31:23.182 --> 31:27.141
It can wait and so can you. It's
the blood test for Robert Campbell.

31:27.161 --> 31:29.240
Doc?
Mr Miller,

31:29.260 --> 31:32.199
I'm not going to examine your leg
in the reception room.

31:32.220 --> 31:35.239
Go through
to the consulting room and wait.

31:35.259 --> 31:37.118
Campbell?
I know who he is.

31:37.139 --> 31:40.198
The bloke they found on the beach.
He's got type-2 diabetes.

31:40.218 --> 31:44.157
I know that. Get him in.
I can't. I don't know where he is.

31:44.177 --> 31:47.076
You took his details down.
I tried, but -

31:47.097 --> 31:49.256
Well, find him.
How am I meant to do that?

31:50.136 --> 31:53.095
OK, thank you for your help.

32:02.093 --> 32:05.132
Joe? It's Morwenna.
I need you to find someone for me.

32:06.253 --> 32:10.012
It might look OK to you, Doc,
but to me it feels gammy.

32:10.032 --> 32:11.031
Gammy.

32:11.052 --> 32:13.111
No calls!

32:13.131 --> 32:16.150
Have you twisted it lately?

32:16.170 --> 32:19.049
Doc, pick up! It's urgent.

32:22.129 --> 32:25.088
Hello?
Hello, Doc. It's Penhale.

32:25.109 --> 32:28.128
Yes, Penhale, what is it?
Do you know a Barry Nugent?

32:28.148 --> 32:30.227
Runs a dairy farm up a New Cross.

32:30.248 --> 32:35.146
His gate's been blocked by this car.
I was told this call was urgent.

32:35.167 --> 32:39.126
And there's this bloke, Robert
Campbell been sleeping in the car.

32:39.146 --> 32:41.145
Robert Campbell's a patient.
Is he there?

32:41.165 --> 32:47.083
Not as such. But I'm a little bit
confused because I found a diary

32:47.104 --> 32:50.223
and it's got some rather unsavoury
comments about your aunt Ruth.

32:50.243 --> 32:53.062
Is it Campbell's diary?
I assume so.

32:53.083 --> 32:56.122
It seems he's quite an obsessive
sort of character.

32:57.122 --> 32:59.181
Somebody left a birthday cake
in her kitchen.

33:00.001 --> 33:02.020
Oh, that's nice.

33:02.041 --> 33:05.040
Go to Ruth's farm as quickly
as you can. I'll meet you there.

33:09.179 --> 33:12.058
Doc?
I haven't got time. I'll call you.

34:33.202 --> 34:35.201
Oh!

34:36.061 --> 34:38.060
I'm so sorry, Dr Ellingham.

34:39.021 --> 34:41.020
Did I scare you?

34:44.978 --> 34:48.058
Mr Campbell.
Please, Dr Ellingham.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.178
Call me Bob.

34:51.018 --> 34:53.996
I knew you'd recognise
my voice on the radio.

34:54.137 --> 34:58.136
Thank you for making it clear
what you wanted.

34:59.216 --> 35:02.195
I'm afraid I don't really know
what you're talking about.

35:03.016 --> 35:07.974
Tell her how you feel,
face to face?

35:08.215 --> 35:12.974
How did you find me?
You left so many clues in your book.

35:14.193 --> 35:16.172
And that photograph.

35:18.092 --> 35:20.991
That smile.

35:21.012 --> 35:23.171
You know I've loved you
ever since we first met.

35:24.171 --> 35:28.050
Four years, five months,
three weeks.

35:29.010 --> 35:33.089
I don't blame you for telling them
it wasn't safe to let me go.

35:34.069 --> 35:36.208
They had to change their minds
eventually.

35:37.988 --> 35:41.087
Now we can start our new life,
together.

35:43.007 --> 35:46.126
Where are you going?
Just downstairs.

35:47.086 --> 35:49.125
I didn't lock the doors

35:49.146 --> 35:52.125
and we don't want to be disturbed,
do we?

35:53.165 --> 35:57.064
No.
I want to protect you, Bob.

35:57.084 --> 35:59.963
Keep you safe.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.083
I'll just go down to the kitchen.

36:22.159 --> 36:25.198
I've locked every door,
every window.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.017
The phone's discon -

36:28.998 --> 36:33.057
What are you doing?
Just making sure it's switched off.

36:33.077 --> 36:37.176
Which it is.
Why don't we have a cup of tea?

36:37.196 --> 36:40.175
Then you can tell me what
you've been up to since we last met.

36:40.195 --> 36:44.114
Nothing.
I've done nothing since... you know.

36:44.994 --> 36:48.033
Even so, I'd like to sit down
and have a talk.

36:48.954 --> 36:52.973
We're going to have a bath.
Of course we are.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.072
But why don't we have
a cup of tea first?

36:55.152 --> 36:58.151
We have all the time in the world.

37:08.010 --> 37:10.009
You called someone!
No, no. I promise.

37:10.029 --> 37:12.108
But you love me. You said you did.
When did I -

37:12.129 --> 37:15.008
On the radio.
"She will feel the same as I do."

37:15.028 --> 37:17.187
"She will love me"
and you nodded your head.

37:18.047 --> 37:20.046
We have to be alone!

37:20.147 --> 37:21.986
We have to!

37:32.184 --> 37:34.183
Psst!

37:36.184 --> 37:41.042
OK. I got eyes on a male icy one,
who's inside with your aunt.

37:41.063 --> 37:44.942
I didn't show myself. I want
to know more about this man first.

37:44.962 --> 37:48.081
As far as I'm aware, he's a stalker
with a history of mental illness.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.960
Dangerous? Violent?
Quite possibly.

37:50.981 --> 37:54.080
We need backup. Swat team,
chopper cover, armed response.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.099
Could you get all that?
No.

37:57.059 --> 37:59.058
Idiot.

38:02.078 --> 38:03.137
Ruth?

38:04.018 --> 38:05.957
Where are you?

38:05.977 --> 38:09.116
It's just my nephew, Martin.
You can't be sure who it is.

38:09.137 --> 38:11.996
It's me, Martin!

38:12.016 --> 38:15.175
There you are.
He only wants to say hello.

38:17.955 --> 38:21.014
We can't be sure if he's alone.
Oh, I'm sure he is.

38:21.114 --> 38:24.093
Look, why don't we sit down?

38:24.933 --> 38:26.932
Come on.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.052
It's perfectly safe now.

38:32.072 --> 38:34.911
'Two armed officers
to the north of the building.'

38:34.931 --> 38:38.030
'One to the south.
I want a sniper on the roof.'

38:38.051 --> 38:42.070
And keep the dogs in reserve until
I give the word to release them.

38:44.929 --> 38:49.068
The dogs are in position. Do you
want me to release the helicopter?

38:49.088 --> 38:50.947
Penhale, shut up.
Sorry.

38:50.968 --> 38:53.007
Sorry.
You're making it worse.

38:53.128 --> 38:56.967
Try going in through the door.
I can't see anything in the windows.

38:59.146 --> 39:02.925
It's locked.
I'll find a way in round the back.

39:03.026 --> 39:05.019
Don't worry, Doc. We'll get her out.

39:16.082 --> 39:18.932
Ruth!

39:18.953 --> 39:20.986
If you come through that door,
I will kill you.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.873
Do you hear me? I will kill you.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.843
Get out.

39:27.864 --> 39:30.874
No. I'm worried about my aunt.

39:31.831 --> 39:33.904
And about you.
There's nothing wrong with me.

39:33.924 --> 39:35.997
Yes, there is.
You have type-2 diabetes.

39:36.017 --> 39:39.864
You're lying.
Oh, you must listen to my nephew.

39:39.884 --> 39:43.771
He knows what he's talking about.
I need to take your sugar level,

39:43.791 --> 39:45.844
give you insulin
and get you to hospital.

39:45.864 --> 39:48.834
I'm going nowhere.
Tell him, Dr Ellingham.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.903
Oh, of course I will, Bob.
But before he goes,

39:51.924 --> 39:54.894
I wonder if perhaps
he might not help you.

39:55.791 --> 40:00.754
Do you really think that insulin is
the best thing for Bob right now?

40:00.775 --> 40:03.904
What the hell are you talking about?
I thought perhaps Largactil

40:03.925 --> 40:07.832
might do a better job.
Or Benzodiazepine?

40:08.868 --> 40:10.901
Yes. I agree.

40:12.935 --> 40:17.818
Well, at least the policeman
shut up. That's good, isn't it?

40:17.839 --> 40:20.809
You don't think
he's planning something? I doubt it.

40:36.816 --> 40:40.743
You mustn't leave me.
I won't, Bob.

40:40.763 --> 40:43.613
If that's what you want.

40:43.634 --> 40:46.703
You were always very kind to me,
Dr Ellingham.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.750
I'm ready.
Oh, please let him do this, Bob.

40:50.770 --> 40:54.657
Tell him to go away.
I think you'd better do as he says.

40:54.677 --> 40:58.663
Leave you alone with a psychopath?
I'm not a psychopath.

40:59.621 --> 41:01.574
I am not a psychopath.

41:01.774 --> 41:03.687
Want me to prove it?

41:05.541 --> 41:07.594
Uh... No. I believe you.

41:07.694 --> 41:09.508
Then go.

41:11.681 --> 41:15.647
Let the knife go!
You let go!

41:16.565 --> 41:19.555
I will kill you.
Ow!

41:20.592 --> 41:22.585
I love you!

41:26.453 --> 41:28.478
I knew it.

41:28.498 --> 41:30.704
If you truly love me, too,

41:31.667 --> 41:33.632
you'd drop that knife.

41:44.623 --> 41:46.628
Argh!

41:51.763 --> 41:55.573
I don't feel very well.

41:57.700 --> 42:00.547
Nobody move! Armed police!

42:02.794 --> 42:04.799
I've got a baton.
Oh, for God's sake.

42:05.582 --> 42:07.667
Is this the loony? Stay down!

42:07.687 --> 42:10.755
If you attempt to get up,
you will be tasered.

42:10.776 --> 42:12.801
I've left it in the car.
Could you get it?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.830
No.
Dr Ellingham.

42:17.635 --> 42:19.720
I love you.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.631
Not me. He means her.

42:30.872 --> 42:33.659
Am I right in assuming
he's a former patient?

42:33.680 --> 42:36.628
Yes. De Clerambault's syndrome.

42:36.648 --> 42:39.897
A paranoid illusion
with amorous fixations.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.784
Probably made worse by the diabetes.

42:43.908 --> 42:48.701
I'll make you a cup of tea.
I'm not going back in that kitchen.

42:48.722 --> 42:51.790
What? Ever?
Well, certainly not tonight.

42:51.810 --> 42:53.795
I've been out here long enough.

42:53.816 --> 42:56.804
Tomorrow I'll look
for somewhere in the village.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.809
You really don't
have to worry about him.

42:58.830 --> 43:00.815
He'll be locked up for years.

43:00.836 --> 43:03.964
By the time he gets out,
you'll... you'll have gone away.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.754
Fingers crossed.

43:11.907 --> 43:13.812
Louisa.
Hi, Bert.

43:13.832 --> 43:16.840
What's happening with the newspaper?
Well...

43:17.883 --> 43:21.954
I've thought about it.
And I've decided not to do anything.

43:21.975 --> 43:25.825
It's just a school newspaper.
You've done nothing?

43:25.845 --> 43:28.933
Well, what I've done
is to allow an intelligent girl

43:28.954 --> 43:32.002
to write an article criticising
a meal she didn't enjoy very much.

43:32.023 --> 43:35.793
I know, but -
I can see it from your viewpoint.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.999
And I'm sorry if you think
Becky's been unfair.

43:38.019 --> 43:40.987
But she is ten.
I haven't poisoned anyone.

43:41.970 --> 43:44.898
Not for ages, anyway.

43:44.919 --> 43:49.872
Would it help if we put an advert
into the next edition?

43:49.892 --> 43:53.080
OK.
Great. We'll do that, then.

43:53.101 --> 43:55.968
But I want a photograph
of the restaurant.

43:55.989 --> 43:59.057
And the menu. And maybe a voucher.

43:59.961 --> 44:03.896
I can take the photo myself,
but you pay for the printing.

44:17.006 --> 44:20.017
Gosh, what a day. How's your hand?

44:20.037 --> 44:23.128
No, it's fine.
Are you sure you're all right?

44:24.133 --> 44:27.164
Yes. I'm fine. How was your day?
Yeah, good.

44:27.184 --> 44:30.978
I bumped into Bert.
Found myself defending Becky Wead.

44:30.999 --> 44:33.247
Freedom of the press, fair comment.
That sort of thing.

44:34.010 --> 44:36.198
Quite right. She's written something
about you now.

44:36.219 --> 44:38.025
What?

44:38.046 --> 44:41.238
"A bedside manner is a concept
completely alien to Dr Ellingham."

44:42.121 --> 44:45.092
"He's patronising, abrasive,

44:45.113 --> 44:48.244
and completely disempathetic."
It's not even a word.

44:49.309 --> 44:53.143
I know, Martin. But apart from that,
I think it's very well written

44:53.163 --> 44:55.090
for a ten-year-old.

44:55.111 --> 44:56.275
Yes.

44:57.179 --> 45:01.134
Are you sure you're all right?
You look very pale.

45:01.154 --> 45:03.282
I'm fine. Thank you.

45:24.342 --> 45:27.393
â™ª Nobody likes me
Everybody hates me

45:27.434 --> 45:30.385
â™ª I think I'll go and eat worms â™ª

45:30.405 --> 45:32.412
Come back in five days.

45:32.433 --> 45:36.428
What if I drop dead before then?
We'll cancel the appointment.

45:37.252 --> 45:38.476
Show me your tattoo.
Which one?

45:38.496 --> 45:41.346
You've got more than one?
Oh, joke.

45:42.472 --> 45:44.479
Like what you see?

45:45.305 --> 45:51.360
