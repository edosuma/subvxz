[Bobby grunts]

00:39.419 --> 00:40.408
[Exclaims]

00:40.587 --> 00:42.020
I'm cold.

00:42.188 --> 00:44.918
Why don't we just buy the worms
at a bait shop?

00:45.158 --> 00:47.922
Bait shop worms are factory-farm worms.

00:47.994 --> 00:50.588
They keep them in little cages
their whole lives.

00:50.663 --> 00:53.962
They never get to run around free.
It's sad, really.

00:54.334 --> 00:56.393
And the fish know the difference.

00:56.469 --> 00:58.801
Why don't you just buy the fish?

00:59.105 --> 01:01.096
You're missing the point.

01:01.708 --> 01:03.801
We don't fish for the fish.

01:04.143 --> 01:08.170
Ninety percent of what I like
about this sport, and it is a sport...

01:08.648 --> 01:11.776
is sitting in the boat
for five hours doing nothing.

01:12.051 --> 01:16.181
And the icing on the cake is when
God smiles on you and you hook one.

01:16.489 --> 01:20.391
And then when you're reeling it in,
everything else falls away.

01:20.893 --> 01:23.521
You don't think about taxes or traffic...

01:23.763 --> 01:26.994
or that pushy gal
that's trying to get into the Citadel...

01:27.066 --> 01:28.761
or who's going to take care of you...

01:28.835 --> 01:31.633
when your mother and I are old
and incapacitated.

01:31.838 --> 01:35.638
All there is
is a man, a rod, a lake, and a fish.

01:35.908 --> 01:39.366
And it all starts
with a hand-dug American worm.

01:40.613 --> 01:43.673
Dad, who is gonna take care of me?

01:44.984 --> 01:46.281
What the hell?

01:46.486 --> 01:47.612
[Engine sputtering]

01:47.687 --> 01:49.726
Somebody's trying to steal my truck.
Hey! Get out of there!

01:49.726 --> 01:51.193
Somebody's trying to steal my truck.
Hey! Get out of there!

01:51.295 --> 01:53.058
BILLY RAY: Let me go, man!

01:53.130 --> 01:56.531
HANK: You ain't going nowhere.
I'm placing you under citizen's arrest.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.727
- You can't do that.
- The hell I can't!

01:58.802 --> 02:01.270
BOBBY: The hell he can't!
HANK: Language, Bobby.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.098
As an American citizen,
I have the authority...

02:04.174 --> 02:06.904
to detain you until an officer
of the peace arrives.

02:06.977 --> 02:09.172
I also have the authority to kick your ass...

02:09.246 --> 02:12.113
which is something that your father
obviously forgot to do.

02:12.516 --> 02:13.505
[Gavel pounding]

02:13.584 --> 02:15.916
Billy Ray Walters,
you've entered a plea of guilty.

02:15.986 --> 02:17.920
Have your rights been explained to you?

02:17.988 --> 02:19.046
HANK: Rights?

02:19.122 --> 02:22.250
This had better not be one of them
Carter-appointee judges.

02:22.326 --> 02:24.226
No, that's Judge Rowland McFarland.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.762
He was in the paper
for his creative sentencing.

02:26.830 --> 02:27.956
Oh, great!

02:28.265 --> 02:29.357
Before I sentence you...

02:29.433 --> 02:32.300
I want to express the court's appreciation
to Mr. Hank Hill...

02:32.369 --> 02:33.461
Quiet, Peggy.

02:33.537 --> 02:36.301
...who apprehended you
at great risk to his own person.

02:36.707 --> 02:39.073
[Sighs] Hank's lucky he didn't get killed.

02:39.142 --> 02:41.906
I hope they lock that thief up
and throw away the key.

02:41.979 --> 02:44.072
That thief is my boyfriend.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.447
- Boyfriend?
- Okay, Hot-wire.

02:47.618 --> 02:50.052
Here's what we're gonna do.
You like trucks so much?

02:50.120 --> 02:52.680
For the next 3 months,
I sentence you to live in a truck.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.780
What the...

02:53.857 --> 02:57.020
In prison, they'll just teach you
how to be a better truck thief.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.960
So you're gonna spend the next 90 days
in the cab of a pickup. An import.

03:01.198 --> 03:02.222
[All gasp]

03:04.468 --> 03:07.301
Finally, a judge with some common sense.

03:08.539 --> 03:10.666
ATTENDANT: Hill?
HANK: Yeah, Hank Hill.

03:10.741 --> 03:12.868
You were holding my truck for evidence.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.309
Here's a picture of her, if it'll help.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.506
Yes, here it is: Space G-26.

03:19.149 --> 03:21.947
What the... Oh, my God!

03:22.152 --> 03:24.882
- What did you do to my truck?
- Let's see.

03:25.022 --> 03:28.788
The thief was inside your vehicle.
So under the law, we checked it for drugs.

03:28.859 --> 03:30.326
He was in my front seat.

03:30.394 --> 03:33.022
He didn't hide any drugs in my spark plugs.

03:33.163 --> 03:34.790
We know that now.

03:37.734 --> 03:38.723
[Birds chirping]

03:38.802 --> 03:40.963
HANK: [Sighs]
If I don't get out on the lake...

03:41.038 --> 03:42.835
my head is gonna pop a gasket.

03:42.906 --> 03:44.635
Honey, please, calm down.

03:44.875 --> 03:48.140
If you have a stroke,
who will help me take care of Bobby?

03:48.378 --> 03:51.506
LUANNE: Uncle Hank,
I got the '92 Ford truck schematic...

03:51.582 --> 03:53.447
and I've lined up all the parts.

03:53.517 --> 03:56.509
Dad, what are you looking for?
Are you looking for chicken?

03:56.587 --> 04:00.421
- It's right here. Chicken.
- I'm looking for my dang fishing shears.

04:00.557 --> 04:01.785
PEGGY: Relax.

04:01.925 --> 04:05.656
Here. Nancy gave me some ginseng tea.
She got it from John Redcorn...

04:05.729 --> 04:09.096
Ginseng? I don't need
to get all hopped up on dope.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.999
LUANNE: I get stressed out
at the beauty school sometimes...

04:12.069 --> 04:16.028
with all the combing and politics,
and I just do yoga.

04:16.273 --> 04:19.106
I can put my feet up behind my head.
Want me to show you?

04:19.176 --> 04:20.165
No!

04:20.310 --> 04:23.541
Keep your legs below your waist,
for God's sakes!

04:23.814 --> 04:27.011
Look, all I need to do
is get out on the lake, and fish.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.734
Listen to that silence.

04:46.003 --> 04:49.495
- You ever hear anything so quiet?
- Hey, Boomhauer!

04:49.573 --> 04:53.236
Trade you one of my garlic-scented lures
for one of your electric ones.

04:53.310 --> 04:57.610
Why don't you guys call that stuff
by its real name: Cheater bait.

04:58.415 --> 05:01.009
DALE: You and your worms
are fishing in the past.

05:01.218 --> 05:06.019
In the days of black-and-white televisions,
and a democratically elected Congress.

05:09.926 --> 05:13.919
Got one, man! It's a big ol'...
Man, look at them big ol' teeth on him!

05:13.997 --> 05:17.228
Acts like a big ol' taco grande, man,
with them dang ol'...

05:18.168 --> 05:20.728
Dang, Boomhauer! She's a beauty.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.006
Say, "Cheese to meet you."

05:23.774 --> 05:24.763
[Dale laughs]

05:24.875 --> 05:28.038
Okay, catch and release.
Time to throw her back.

05:28.645 --> 05:31.671
All right, fella, there you go.
Tell your friends:

05:31.748 --> 05:34.148
"Plenty more where that came from."

05:38.321 --> 05:39.345
[Dale's reel whirring]

[Upbeat instrumental music]

06:00.911 --> 06:03.846
Hank, maybe
you should be taking the pictures.

06:03.914 --> 06:05.541
Give you something to do.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.776
You guys may be catching fish...

06:07.851 --> 06:11.150
but I'm the only one fishing God's way,
with a worm.

06:11.555 --> 06:15.514
You know what I just realized?
Hank hasn't caught a fish.

06:15.659 --> 06:18.492
- You looking to go for a swim, Bill?
- No.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.586
You know what else I just realized?

06:20.664 --> 06:24.225
This is the first time any of us
has caught more fish than Hank.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.362
Come on, Bill. Don't rub his nose in it.
Wingo, man!

06:28.538 --> 06:29.869
I am the greatest.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.066
[Dale chuckles]

06:34.511 --> 06:35.500
[Sighs]

06:38.648 --> 06:43.176
So, we're all meeting at the pharmacy
to get aloe Vera for Bill's back.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.780
[Groaning]

06:45.989 --> 06:47.786
Maybe I'll meet you guys later.

06:47.858 --> 06:51.555
I'm going down to the bait shop
to buy some new hooks.

06:59.035 --> 07:00.627
HANK: Dang, Ray! What happened?

07:00.704 --> 07:04.231
Did I miss one of your
"Ray's Gone Trout of His Mind" sales?

07:04.441 --> 07:08.309
I'm going trout of business.
I can't compete with the Mega Lo Mart.

07:08.612 --> 07:11.706
I hate Mega Lo Mart.
People go there just to save a nickel...

07:11.782 --> 07:14.342
end up putting half of Arlen
out of business.

07:14.484 --> 07:17.942
Anyway, what brings you in?
New rod, new reel, what?

07:18.121 --> 07:21.784
Actually, I was thinking
of trying one of them scented lures.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.682
Maybe vanilla.

07:24.461 --> 07:26.395
You've given up the worm?

07:26.596 --> 07:29.656
She let me down. I reeled in empty today.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.927
How about some fluorescent salmon eggs...

07:33.003 --> 07:36.029
or marshmallow bait,
or some blood-dough balls?

07:36.139 --> 07:39.199
I tried those before.
They don't beat the worm.

07:39.476 --> 07:40.966
Hey, I know.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.175
You ever hear of a guy named Jack?

07:43.246 --> 07:45.680
I went to high school with a fella named...

07:45.749 --> 07:48.616
RAY: This guy never went to school.
He grew up in the hills.

07:48.685 --> 07:51.313
But he wrote the book on homemade bait.

07:51.521 --> 07:54.888
Course, it's just a bunch of scribbles,
'cause he never went to school.

07:54.958 --> 07:58.052
HANK: Where's his shop?
RAY: He don't have a shop.

07:58.128 --> 08:01.757
He sells his stuff out of his truck
at the corner of 6th and Woodmont.

08:01.832 --> 08:02.992
Well, thanks.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.063
I'll come by tomorrow
and pick up your propane tank.

08:06.136 --> 08:07.125
[Agreeing]

08:07.237 --> 08:09.228
Why don't you call first?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.699

[Tires screeching]

[Funky instrumental music]

08:30.327 --> 08:31.624
Hey, G!

08:31.962 --> 08:34.328
Whaddaya want, whaddaya need?
Looking to buy?

08:34.731 --> 08:35.720
G...

08:36.198 --> 08:37.688
I am looking to buy.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.496
- Are you Jack?
- I got your jack right here, Jack.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.799
HANK: As I was telling Ray, Jack...

08:43.340 --> 08:46.036
I've been thinking
about trying something new.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.167
JACK: Whatcha need?

08:47.244 --> 08:49.439
I've always been a worm man...

08:49.512 --> 08:51.912
but Ray was telling me about your bait...

08:51.982 --> 08:55.509
Bait? You call it "bait."
I like that. What you looking to spend?

08:56.820 --> 08:58.185
Well, I got $20.

08:58.722 --> 09:01.589
$20 will get you all the bait you need.
Rock on!

09:05.228 --> 09:08.720
Freshness jars.
Sure don't get that at Mega Lo Mart.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.906
DALE: Come on, Hank,
fish or get off the pot.

09:25.682 --> 09:27.172
Just a second.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.554
How the heck does Jack fish
with this stuff?

09:35.759 --> 09:37.420
I like beer, Hank.

09:37.894 --> 09:40.863
Don't you like beer? I love beer.

09:40.931 --> 09:44.162
BILL: Beer is...
HANK: Got one! Yeah!

09:45.068 --> 09:47.229
Sweet Gene Vincent! I'm back!

09:47.370 --> 09:49.395
Dang, man! That's quick. You done hooked.

09:49.472 --> 09:52.407
Hank's the man.
Man, you're the fishing magician, man.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.986
All right there, Red Head. Back you go.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.817
Looks like they're hungry for worms today.
Pass me one, will you, Hank?

10:00.624 --> 10:04.082
What's the matter?
Batteries go dead on your electric spinner?

10:04.462 --> 10:07.829
Whoa, Hank! What you got there?
Blood-dough balls?

10:07.898 --> 10:12.301
Dale, Hank only fishes with worms.
Why, anything else would be cheating.

10:12.603 --> 10:14.230
Well, well, well.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.669
Looks like our friend is a "hippiecrit."

10:16.741 --> 10:20.074
Hold on there. This is natural bait.

10:20.511 --> 10:22.240
Homemade in the USA.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.949
Hank, you can offer all the denials
and rationalizations you want...

10:27.017 --> 10:29.076
but the bottom line is still the same.

10:29.153 --> 10:31.314
BILL: We want to try that bait.
DALE: Yeah, man.

10:31.388 --> 10:34.448
All right. Ease off.
A little chunk will do you.

10:42.299 --> 10:43.891
[All exclaiming]

10:47.938 --> 10:50.270
Now that is the dangdest thing!

10:50.741 --> 10:53.471
This is the same fish I just threw back.

10:54.078 --> 10:56.512
Come on, darling. Time to get wet.

10:57.715 --> 10:59.706
Come on now. Off my hook.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.346
Go on now, get.

11:04.855 --> 11:06.186
Vámonos.

[Screams]

11:12.496 --> 11:13.485
[Groans]

11:13.998 --> 11:17.365
Oh, man! Now I have to reapply
my sunscreen.

11:18.369 --> 11:19.961

[Hoedown music playing]

11:22.306 --> 11:23.295
[Laughing]

11:32.383 --> 11:36.843
I tell you what, I caught more fish today
than I did in the '80s.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.748
And those were the Reagan years.

11:48.032 --> 11:49.021
[Sighing]

11:57.775 --> 11:59.367
Somebody call Ripley.

11:59.443 --> 12:03.379
'Cause he's the only one who'll believe
how many fish I caught this morning.

12:04.148 --> 12:05.513
Is that where you've been?

12:05.583 --> 12:08.609
- Oh, good Lord! The sun just came up.
- No, it didn't.

12:08.886 --> 12:11.320
It rose at 4:57 a.m...

12:11.388 --> 12:15.415
exactly one hour after I landed
two 10-pound bucket mouths...

12:15.492 --> 12:16.652
on a single hook.

12:17.094 --> 12:21.121
I tell you, it's like they were fighting
over that piece of Jack's miracle bait.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.393
What are you buying bait for, Dad?

12:23.467 --> 12:27.699
Remember, you said it all starts
with a hand-dug American worm?

12:28.672 --> 12:32.073
No. I mean, yes, that's how it starts.

12:32.142 --> 12:35.077
But a lot of things end up
different from where they start.

12:35.179 --> 12:38.205
Like, remember that time
I started building you a clubhouse...

12:38.282 --> 12:40.716
and I ended up with a new tool shed?

12:40.885 --> 12:41.909
[Clears throat]

12:41.986 --> 12:43.851
So, Luanne, how's my truck?

12:43.921 --> 12:44.910
[Luanne groans]

12:45.022 --> 12:48.321
Bad news, Uncle Hank.
I had to order a new fuel pump.

12:48.626 --> 12:51.823
I figured it was urgent,
so I asked them to UPS it.

12:51.996 --> 12:55.693
Good thing I just got back from fishing,
or that would bother me.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.966
It's kind of starting to bother me.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.330
Yep, I'm bothered.
I had better get on the lake.

13:04.942 --> 13:08.400
I'll tell you, I can't wait
to try some more of your new bait.

13:08.479 --> 13:12.711
My bait? I wish I could help you,
but I only have a little bit left.

13:13.117 --> 13:16.917
That's all right. It only takes a little bit
to catch the hogs with that stuff.

13:16.987 --> 13:19.512
Yeah, it's too bad I'm all out.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.416
You just said you had a little left.

13:22.559 --> 13:26.222
- That's right, and then I used it up.
- Don't lie to us, friend.

13:26.297 --> 13:29.926
'Cause when you lie,
you make an ass out of you and me.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.560
Yeah, don't be bogarting that dang ol' bait.

13:32.903 --> 13:36.202
Anyway, I just remembered I promised
Bobby I'd take him fishing...

13:36.273 --> 13:38.366
just the two of us. See you.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.399
[Door closes]

13:50.054 --> 13:52.181
I'd take a stick of that gum.

13:54.158 --> 13:55.648
[Bobby grunting]

14:00.931 --> 14:02.193
I'm tired.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.700
When's the part where we get to
sit around for five hours doing nothing?

14:05.769 --> 14:06.758
[Chuckles]

14:06.904 --> 14:08.633
That's a good one, son.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.832
[Rustling]

14:11.909 --> 14:12.933
[Dog barking]

14:13.010 --> 14:15.240
Wake up, Hank. We're being burgled.

14:15.346 --> 14:16.870
[Groaning]

14:17.381 --> 14:18.370
[Grunts]

14:18.916 --> 14:21.476
You go check on Bobby.
I'll go see what's going on.

14:24.788 --> 14:27.689
We'll just see
how much of that bait he has left.

14:27.758 --> 14:29.851
You! Drop that tackle box!

14:30.127 --> 14:32.391
[Exclaims] It's okay. It's me, Dale Gribble.

14:33.097 --> 14:34.962
I said drop the box!

14:35.299 --> 14:36.630
[Engine starting]

14:36.834 --> 14:39.564
My termite inspection is concluded.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.669
Congratulations, you passed!

14:45.876 --> 14:48.310
BOBBY: Can I have some more butter
for my pancakes?

14:48.379 --> 14:50.506
That's it! I'm going fishing.

15:00.157 --> 15:01.146
[Sighing]

15:05.362 --> 15:09.093
Come on, take the bait.
You know you want it.

15:12.770 --> 15:16.399
Where are you going? This ain't a worm.
This is the good stuff.

15:16.974 --> 15:18.635
[Tires screeching]

15:19.276 --> 15:21.744
Oh, man, the wonder bait! For me?

15:22.379 --> 15:25.644
- Wait a minute. What's wrong with it?
- It doesn't work anymore.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.445
The fish won't touch the stuff.

15:27.518 --> 15:31.352
- They spit it out like poison. I don't get it.
- I get it.

15:31.422 --> 15:35.358
Take it from a graduate
of the Exterminators Academy at Humble.

15:35.426 --> 15:38.520
You've introduced a new element
into their ecosystem.

15:38.796 --> 15:41.094
Problem: They've gotten wise to it.

15:41.165 --> 15:43.963
Solution: You need something stronger.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.031
Cockroach 101.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.392
[Sighing]

15:48.405 --> 15:50.373
HANK: Now, don't get me wrong, Jack.

15:50.441 --> 15:53.569
I'm not criticizing your product,
or by extension, you.

15:53.644 --> 15:55.043
Yeah, I get it, Jack.

15:55.112 --> 15:57.842
- What you need is something stronger.
- Exactly.

15:57.948 --> 16:01.008
You understand. What am I saying?
Of course you understand.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.382
You're a fisherman.

16:02.453 --> 16:06.412
DALE: I'll have what he's having.
HANK: Dale? What are you doing here?

16:06.557 --> 16:09.458
I followed you. Every twist and every turn.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.582
[Clears throat]

16:10.661 --> 16:12.686
By the way, I'm gonna need
to follow you home.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.321
[Sirens blaring]

16:14.398 --> 16:16.832
OFFICER: Freeze!
Hands where I can see them!

16:19.403 --> 16:20.961
[Birds chirping]

16:21.105 --> 16:24.597
This is all my fault.
I got you started on that ginseng tea...

16:24.675 --> 16:27.576
and with your addictive personality,
of course that led to...

16:27.644 --> 16:30.670
I swear, Peggy,
I thought I was buying fishing bait.

16:30.747 --> 16:33.181
PEGGY: Don't lie to me, Hank.
I am not stupid.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.811
I am a substitute teacher,
not one of your drug-smoking friends.

16:36.887 --> 16:40.983
Mr. Hill, this bass-fishing defense
isn't going to cut it.

16:42.226 --> 16:45.024
- Were you abused as a child?
- What? No!

16:45.095 --> 16:47.256
Are you sure? Juries eat that up.

16:47.331 --> 16:49.731
Maybe I ought to tie
that long hair on your head...

16:49.800 --> 16:52.598
to the short hair on your ass,
and kick you down the street.

16:52.669 --> 16:54.796
I told you I am not a doper.

16:54.872 --> 16:58.831
Come on, Mr. Hill.
We all use drugs. Even the President.

16:59.009 --> 17:01.534
Not my President. I voted for Dole.

17:01.612 --> 17:04.580
The only thing he's on is pain killers,
and he earned it.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.813
Next case. Misters Gribble and Hill.

17:11.888 --> 17:15.325
Nice to see you again, Mr. Hill.
I assume you are the arresting citizen.

17:15.392 --> 17:19.761
No. It's the funniest kind of mix-up,
Your Honor...

17:19.829 --> 17:20.990
Just one moment.

17:21.064 --> 17:23.328
Mr. Gribble,
remove your hat in my courtroom.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.165
I do not recognize the authority
of a court that hangs the gold-fringed flag.

17:27.237 --> 17:30.297
A flag with gilded edges
is the flag of an Admiralty court.

17:30.374 --> 17:33.172
An Admiralty court
signifies a Naval court-martial.

17:33.243 --> 17:35.871
I cannot be court-martialed twice.
That is all.

17:35.946 --> 17:38.346
- Furthermore...
- Bailiff, gag him.

17:39.483 --> 17:40.472
[Groans]

17:44.321 --> 17:46.263
This must be a typo.

17:47.498 --> 17:48.965
Mr. Hill, you're the last person
I expected to be a drug user.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.898
BOBBY: Objection, Your Honor.

17:51.068 --> 17:52.831
My dad doesn't use drugs.

17:52.903 --> 17:56.430
The only thing he needs
to be happy is fishing. Sustained.

17:56.741 --> 17:57.901
That's right, Judge.

17:57.975 --> 18:01.672
The strongest thing I use
is BC Headache Powder, I tell you what.

18:01.812 --> 18:05.248
I may have accidentally purchased,
once or twice...

18:05.649 --> 18:09.141
some illegal substances,
but I was using them...

18:09.487 --> 18:12.354
quite successfully I might add, as fish bait.

18:12.823 --> 18:14.154
Fish bait?

18:15.426 --> 18:17.724
- Guilty.
- I told you. I told him, Your Honor.

18:17.795 --> 18:20.355
That's enough out of you. You're fired.

18:20.564 --> 18:24.796
Judge, I'm not lying to you here.
I'm no criminal. I'm just a fisherman.

18:24.969 --> 18:26.960
I don't like your story...

18:27.138 --> 18:29.368
but you've got the haircut
of an honest man.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.273
I'm willing to give you a chance
to prove you're not a liar.

18:32.343 --> 18:35.335
- You say you were using the stuff as bait?
- Yes, sir.

18:35.613 --> 18:37.774
I'm a bit of an angler myself.

18:37.915 --> 18:42.113
Tomorrow, you, me, and your bald buddy
there are gonna go out to the lake.

18:42.253 --> 18:45.552
You'll show me how to catch
a wide-mouthed bass with a rock of crack.

18:45.623 --> 18:48.285
Well, hold on a second.

18:48.859 --> 18:51.259
You see, the fish
won't take the bait anymore.

18:51.328 --> 18:54.229
- The ecosystem is changed and...
- I've made my ruling.

18:54.298 --> 18:56.698
Either you reel one in tomorrow,
or the two of you...

18:56.767 --> 19:00.259
are gonna spend the next 24 months
making Texas State license plates.

19:00.371 --> 19:01.360
[Shudders]

19:01.772 --> 19:04.935
CLERK: Next case:
Fidelity Mutual Insurance...

19:05.009 --> 19:07.443
v. Layaway Ray's bait shop.

19:15.686 --> 19:16.983
JUDGE: It's been six hours.

19:17.054 --> 19:19.215
You ready to admit your crime
and do your time?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.848
No, sir, Your Honor.

19:20.925 --> 19:23.655
I'm making progress here. I can feel it.

19:25.896 --> 19:27.887
Wingo, man! I think I got one.

19:27.998 --> 19:30.193
Hold on to her, Dale. Don't let her go.

19:30.267 --> 19:32.462
- Thank you, Lord.
- Well, I'll be!

19:32.536 --> 19:35.528
Looks like you boys
were telling the truth after all.

19:36.874 --> 19:40.435
- Gribble, this fish is frozen.
- I caught it. That's my position.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.502
You obviously bought this
at a grocery store.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.743
You try something like that again,
I'll double your sentence.

19:45.816 --> 19:48.410
Dale, you giblet-head,
if you were gonna cheat...

19:48.486 --> 19:50.647
why the hell did you buy a frozen bass?

19:50.721 --> 19:52.245
I had a coupon.

19:56.227 --> 19:58.422
All right. Five more minutes and that's it.

19:58.496 --> 20:00.794
I got to be at a lethal injection by midnight.

20:00.865 --> 20:04.699
Get your butt off the cooler, Duke.
His Honor wants a pudding.

20:06.770 --> 20:10.001
[Somber instrumental music]

20:16.313 --> 20:17.871
Hank, don't do it.

20:18.048 --> 20:20.881
We've already tried to cheat.
He'll double our sentence.

20:20.951 --> 20:22.748
I'm not cheating now, Dale.

20:22.853 --> 20:24.946
Using cheater bait was cheating.

20:25.289 --> 20:26.654
I got greedy.

20:26.790 --> 20:30.954
I'm no better than that lazy grease ball
who tried to steal my truck.

20:31.529 --> 20:33.963
Let's face the facts. We're going to prison.

20:34.131 --> 20:38.158
And all we'll have to dream about
is the last time we went fishing.

20:38.235 --> 20:41.136
I don't know about you,
but I want to remember casting off...

20:41.205 --> 20:43.400
with a hand-dug American worm.

20:50.247 --> 20:51.236
[Chirping]

20:51.549 --> 20:52.538
[Croaking]

21:06.430 --> 21:09.194
JUDGE: Well, time's up.
Start rowing, Duke.

21:11.001 --> 21:13.561
Now, there's a man who loves to fish.

21:14.104 --> 21:16.902
Almost makes me sorry
to send him to the farm.

21:19.076 --> 21:20.065
[Splashing]

21:26.383 --> 21:29.910
She ain't pretty, but she's a bass all right!
You're free to go.

21:30.087 --> 21:33.682
She's the most beautiful fish I ever caught,
I tell you what!

21:33.757 --> 21:36.191
Hold her up, Hank. She's a wall-hanger.

21:37.795 --> 21:38.819
He.

21:52.859 --> 21:54.656
[Theme song playing]

22:23.335 --> 22:25.303
HANK: That's it! I'm going fishing.
