PLEASE, ARREST US.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.467
YES, PLEASE TAKE US
TO A NICE, SAFE
JAIL. HERE.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.500
KIDS, I'M SURE
MS. LIVINGSTON

16:51.500 --> 16:52.800
WILL TAKE GOOD
CARE OF YOU.

16:52.800 --> 16:57.500
JUST KEEP YOUR
EYES OPEN
FOR THAT MANIAC.

16:58.367 --> 17:02.400
I'M SURE YOU'LL
BE JUST FINE.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.834
OH, MAN. SHE'S GONNA
TAKE CARE OF US ALL RIGHT.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.033
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

17:07.033 --> 17:08.100
YOU KNOW WHY?
WHY?

17:08.100 --> 17:09.867
'CAUSE IT'S STILL
3 AGAINST ONE.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.567
RIGHT, EDDIE?
LET'S...

17:12.567 --> 17:14.100
EDDIE?

17:16.934 --> 17:17.967
WHERE'S EDDIE?

17:17.967 --> 17:20.767
EDDIE'S NOT
WITH US ANYMORE.

17:20.767 --> 17:24.300
HE'S WITH YOUR
FRIEND CHELSEA NOW.

17:25.300 --> 17:29.500
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO LOOK IN MY BAG.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.734
WE GOT YOU GOOD,
HUH, EDDIE?

17:32.734 --> 17:35.767
YEAH, MAN. I CAN'T
BELIEVE HOW SCARED
YOU WERE.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.767
SCARED? I--I WASN'T SCARED.

17:37.767 --> 17:38.500
I WAS JUST PLAYIN', Y'ALL.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.900
SEE, LOOK. I KNEW IT WAS
A JOKE THE WHOLE TIME.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.834
[LAUGHING]

17:48.834 --> 17:51.600
MS. PATTERSON, WHAT
DO YOU WANT FROM US?

17:51.600 --> 17:54.700
OH, I HAVE PLANS
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.900
BIG PLANS.

17:59.467 --> 18:03.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE GOT THEM.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.300
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

18:07.300 --> 18:09.734
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
UH-HUH.

18:09.734 --> 18:12.600

18:12.600 --> 18:14.767
HAVIN' A MOMENT. REALLY.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.300

[SCREAMING]

18:30.800 --> 18:33.000
[BOTH SCREAMING]

18:34.000 --> 18:35.834
OK. NOW THEY'RE GONNA
CUT THE LIGHTS

18:35.834 --> 18:36.867
AND CUE THE THUNDER.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.200
IT'S THE ICING
ON THE CAKE.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.400
AHH. WHERE IS
THIS CAKE?

18:46.767 --> 18:49.367
OH, SNAP.

[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMS]

19:02.734 --> 19:05.100
TIME FOR CAKE,
CHILDREN.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.033
CAKE?

19:06.033 --> 19:08.300
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY..."

19:08.834 --> 19:10.367
"MOM."

19:10.367 --> 19:12.033
THAT LOOKS EXACTLY--
LIKE WHAT?

19:12.033 --> 19:13.400
WHAT HAPPENED?
[MUMBLING]

19:13.400 --> 19:16.367
THE CAKE THAT, UH,
THAT WE USED
TO LIKE.

19:16.367 --> 19:17.300
WELL, IF YOU
LIKE IT SO MUCH,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.000
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU EAT IT NOW?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.400
BE--BECAUSE.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.834
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE DESERT BEFORE--

19:22.834 --> 19:23.500
EAT IT!

19:23.500 --> 19:26.033
I MEAN, CAN WE AT LEAST
HAVE LIKE A FORK?

19:26.033 --> 19:28.400
EAT IT!
Both: OK!

19:29.400 --> 19:32.734
DOES THIS CAKE
BRING BACK
ANY MEMORIES?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.467
[SOBBING]

19:38.467 --> 19:41.233
OK. OK!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.467
WE DID IT.
[SOBBING]

19:43.467 --> 19:47.233
WE ATE THE CAKE
AND WE BLAMED YOU.

19:47.767 --> 19:48.500
WE WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.867
WE DIDN'T WANNA GET
IN ANY TROUBLE.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.567
THE CAKE WAS SO
GOOD,

19:51.567 --> 19:53.233
BUT WE WERE SO BAD.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.200
WE DIDN'T--
[MUMBLING]

19:56.200 --> 19:58.400
SO, YOU ADMIT
THAT YOU ATE
THE CAKE

19:58.400 --> 19:59.500
AND BLAMED ME?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.000
Both: YES!

20:00.000 --> 20:02.233
COULD YOU ADMIT IT
TO THAT CAMERA
OVER THERE?

20:02.233 --> 20:03.700
YES! YES! YES! YES!

20:03.700 --> 20:06.200
WE ATE THE--CAMERA?

20:07.734 --> 20:08.934
RAVEN. CORY.

20:08.934 --> 20:12.967
YOU'RE ON
<i>REVENGE OF</i>
<i>THE BABYSITTER.</i>

20:12.967 --> 20:16.200
HA HA HA.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.500
WE GOT YOU GOOD.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.867
YEAH. THAT'S
WHAT Y'ALL
GET.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.567
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT
A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.600
SO, THIS IS--YOU'RE
SERIOUS?

20:21.600 --> 20:23.033
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
PRACTICAL JOKE,

20:23.033 --> 20:26.300
HIDDEN VIDEO CANDID
PUNK'D SITUATIONS?

20:26.300 --> 20:28.467
YEAH, THAT'S
RIGHT.

20:28.467 --> 20:29.900
DADDY, WHY?

20:29.900 --> 20:30.834
WELL, THE SHOW
CAME TO ME

20:30.834 --> 20:33.100
AND TOLD ME THAT
MS. PATTERSON
WANTED REVENGE,

20:33.100 --> 20:34.033
AND WHEN I HEARD
HER STORY,

20:34.033 --> 20:36.100
I AGREED THAT
YOU TWO DESERVED
IT.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.767
I WAS SUCH
A PUSHOVER
IN THOSE DAYS,

20:37.767 --> 20:41.100
I EVEN LET YOU BLAME
ME FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.200
IT BOTHERED ME
FOR YEARS.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.300
MS. PATTERSON,

20:45.300 --> 20:45.934
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

20:45.934 --> 20:48.300
WELL, IT WAS
JUST A LITTLE
GOOD-NATURED FUN

20:48.300 --> 20:49.100
AT YOUR EXPENSE.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.100
PLUS, I DISCOVERED
I HAVE A REAL
MEAN STREAK.

20:52.100 --> 20:52.867
[GIGGLES]

20:52.867 --> 20:54.734
UH, GUYS, I
THINK THIS IS
WHERE WE LOOK

20:54.734 --> 20:57.133
IN THE CAMERA
AND WAVE.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.600
WHEN DO WE
GET CAKE?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.100
SAY GOOD NIGHT,
CHELSEA.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.200
GOOD NIGHT,
CHELSEA.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.934
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE GOT THEM,

21:15.934 --> 21:18.033
BUT THEY DESERVED IT!

21:18.033 --> 21:20.500
[LAUGHING]

21:20.834 --> 21:21.600
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.800
IN MY VISION IT
REALLY LOOKED

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
LIKE YOU WERE CRYING.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.667
I'M GLAD THE SHOW'S
GETTING CANCELED.

21:26.667 --> 21:27.667
WELL, I DO KNOW
ONE THING.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.400
YOU TWO WILL
NEVER DO
SOMETHING BAD

21:29.400 --> 21:31.133
AND BLAME IT
ON SOMEONE ELSE
AGAIN.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.233
NOW, IF YOU
EXCUSE ME,

21:32.233 --> 21:34.033
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE LAST PIECE
OF STRUDEL

21:34.033 --> 21:37.400
I HAVE BEEN
SAVING
FOR MYSELF.

21:43.033 --> 21:46.467
OK. WHO ATE
THE STRUDEL?

21:46.467 --> 21:47.900
Both: MS. PATTERSON.

21:47.900 --> 21:48.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TWO.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.867
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU BEEN THROUGH,

21:49.867 --> 21:52.600
YOU'RE GONNA BLAME
MS. PATTERSON AGAIN.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.000
[LAUGHING]

21:58.000 --> 21:59.567
GOTCHA!
