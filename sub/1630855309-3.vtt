00:20.625 --> 00:23.250
Oh, thank God.
It was just a nightmare.

00:27.083 --> 00:30.291
It's okay. Dante's penis
can't hurt you anymore.

00:30.291 --> 00:34.000
It's lying dead in the trash can,
just where you left it.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.833
Oh, shit.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.416
No, no, no. It's not possible.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.916
I'm sure there's a simple explanation
for the broken glass.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.625
Maybe a... a local pervert.

00:47.666 --> 00:49.666
But I toilet-murdered you!

00:52.833 --> 00:56.625
Oh, these are my paper-cutting scissors,
but desperate times...

00:58.291 --> 01:01.125
Oh! Why won't you stay dead?

01:01.125 --> 01:03.125
I wish I didn't have to do this.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.833
I actually don't enjoy mangling penises,

01:05.833 --> 01:08.375
and the viewers at home
don't like watching it.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.958
It's upsetting even when it's a cartoon.

01:10.958 --> 01:15.500
Even. When. It's. A. Car. Toon.

01:18.416 --> 01:22.291
FYI, I'm now gonna cut this penis
into tiny pieces...

01:23.250 --> 01:25.166
...and then microwave those pieces.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.333
So unless you wanna watch all that,

01:27.333 --> 01:29.916
you better hope
they cut to the main titles very s--

01:29.916 --> 01:34.291

02:08.166 --> 02:10.625
- Hey. Move it, assholes.
- Excuse us.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.958
Don't you know what day it is, huh?
It's Free Bagel Friday.

02:13.958 --> 02:17.333
Oh, dear God, please still let there be
everything bagels left.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.583
They're not just everything.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.916
They're the only thing!

02:20.916 --> 02:24.291
Sorry, boys. I got the last everything.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.500
- Damn it.
<i>-</i> Oh, but help yourself to plain.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.083
Choke on a bag of shit, Tyler.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.833
Ooh, don't tease me, Gilly.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.250
Oh! Uh-uh. I'm up.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.750
I'm up. Hi.

02:34.750 --> 02:38.333
Um, Emmy, why are you sleeping
in the break room?

02:38.333 --> 02:39.375
Oh, I have crabs.

02:39.375 --> 02:40.875
- Whoa! Hey, now.
- Uh-uh. Get away.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.458
No, no, no, in my apartment.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.541
I can't sleep there.
It's absolutely infested.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.000
An everything.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.458
And I there's no way
I can afford an exterminator.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.000
I don't even have a bank account.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.708
Where the fuck
did you get that everything bagel?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.875
This? I was here
when they dropped 'em off.

02:56.875 --> 02:59.791
Anyway, let me know if you hear
of a cheap-as-hell exterminator.

02:59.791 --> 03:01.666
- Uh, uh, Joe and I could handle it.
- You could?

03:01.666 --> 03:04.958
- We could?
- Emmy, exterminators are a scam.

03:04.958 --> 03:07.708
- Any idiot with the equipment can do it.
- What are you doing, Gil?

03:07.708 --> 03:11.083
- Just follow my fucking lead, Joe.
- If you say so.

03:11.083 --> 03:15.250
Sharon's brother is an exterminator,
and that guy is a dumbass.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.291
I-- I'm sure he won't notice
if I borrow his gear for a few hours.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.333
You would really do this? For free?

03:20.333 --> 03:22.208
Uh, you know, basically free.

03:22.208 --> 03:26.708
We'll handle your crabs problem
in exchange for that everything bagel.

03:26.708 --> 03:29.583
- Oh.
- Uh, okay, you got a deal.

03:29.583 --> 03:33.166
Exterminate the crabs,
then you get the bagel.

03:33.166 --> 03:37.541
Oh-ho-ho, Emmy, we'll have those crabs
out of your apartment in no time.

03:37.541 --> 03:41.916
Hoo! Just talking about Emmy's crabs
is making me hungry for that bagel.

03:41.916 --> 03:45.750
Paul Krummhorn.
It's been a hell of a year, huh?

03:45.750 --> 03:49.291
Evelyn, his wife of nearly 40 years,
is gone.

03:49.291 --> 03:52.083
But we did some great grieving.

03:52.083 --> 03:55.208
We cried, we ate some good lasagnas,

03:55.208 --> 03:59.208
and we even spent all of October
in our bathrobes.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.666
And now it's time to move forward.

04:01.666 --> 04:04.041
Exactly. Gimme that.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.458
And that's why Paul and I have decided

04:07.458 --> 04:11.041
to take the annual trip
to Santa Fe.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.083
- Yes!
- Oh.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.375
You're still taking the couples' trip?

04:14.375 --> 04:16.416
Just Paul, Dave, and Kathy?

04:16.416 --> 04:17.666
Well, we could bring Evelyn,

04:17.666 --> 04:20.541
but we'd need to get a shovel...
...wouldn't we, hey?

04:20.541 --> 04:23.791
- Don't go. This trip is a huge mistake.
- No, it's not.

04:23.791 --> 04:27.208
Everything will remind him
of his dead wife and how she's dead.

04:27.208 --> 04:31.833
But perhaps misery is what Paul deserves,
ay, for outliving his wife.

04:31.833 --> 04:36.541
No. It's gonna make him happy.
He'll celebrate his love for Evelyn.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.583
Aww, look at her,

04:38.583 --> 04:42.416
with her wild hair, her big, loud laugh,

04:42.416 --> 04:46.250
her obsession
with kissing dogs on the mouth.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.625
Walter, are you okay?

04:47.625 --> 04:49.416
Yes, and so is Paul.

04:49.416 --> 04:53.000
He's goin' on the trip,
and I already have an outfit picked out.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.125
I suppose I could purchase a bolo tie.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.791
And I should get sunscreen
so I don't get skin cancer,

04:57.791 --> 04:59.166
like you-know-who.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.583
No! You two Dixie cups full of dog shit
aren't invited.

05:02.583 --> 05:06.500
- Oh!
- No shame, no anxiety, just love.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.708
This dead-wife trip
is gonna be fun, goddamn it.

05:10.708 --> 05:12.958
Oh, looks like he took the clicker.

05:12.958 --> 05:16.541
Oh, you're not stealing my money today,
you greedy little pop pig.

05:16.541 --> 05:18.041
I need my soda now.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.291
Damn right.

05:20.291 --> 05:24.250
Holy moly, Rochelle's even more gorgeous
as a hate worm.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.833
Okay, here goes.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.000
Again? Why won't you die?!

05:32.541 --> 05:35.375
<i>- ♪ Tell me, dick ♪</i>

06:00.666 --> 06:02.875
"Shouldn't the investments
in her 401(k) be aggressive?"

06:03.791 --> 06:05.708
- What the fuck?
- Holy fucking shit!

06:06.250 --> 06:07.250
Yes, she has...

06:07.250 --> 06:08.708
What the fuck is going on?

06:08.708 --> 06:12.541
...time to weather
the volatility of the markets,

06:12.541 --> 06:14.041
but with a new baby,

06:14.666 --> 06:17.791
there's a greater need
for a conservative rebalancing...

06:17.791 --> 06:18.958
Goddamn!

06:18.958 --> 06:20.541
...of her portfolio.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.708
Uh...

06:21.708 --> 06:23.041
Meeting adjourned?

06:23.041 --> 06:27.833
Thanks, asshole. You got chode guts
all over my favorite fucking water bottle.

06:27.833 --> 06:31.833
Hey, Petey Pete.
You wanna talk about what's up?

06:31.833 --> 06:34.750
What's up is that I'm being stalked
by Dante's zombie penis.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.666
Mm-hmm.

06:35.666 --> 06:39.083
I can't so much as say,
"Hey, Rochelle, how about Mondays?"

06:39.083 --> 06:40.666
without it trying to kill me.

06:40.666 --> 06:44.583
Now, we've all been haunted by a D before,
but in the office?

06:44.583 --> 06:47.708
It's unprofessional.
It's bothering people.

06:47.708 --> 06:52.041
Oh, well, I'm so sorry that my living hell
is bothering people.

06:52.041 --> 06:55.333
But that goddamn evil dick won't die.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.375
Oh, yup, yeah, I see it twitching.
It's jerking back to life.

06:58.375 --> 06:59.458
What do I do?

06:59.458 --> 07:01.750
It seems to me what you need is

07:01.750 --> 07:03.375
the Dick Whisperer.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.291
Great! Dick Whisperer!
Uh, do you have, like, his email address?

07:06.291 --> 07:09.333
You can find him up yonder,
up on that roof.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.708
So I-- I just need to go up--

07:14.708 --> 07:16.958
- Up yonder, exactly.
- Ah.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.333
So stop your pondering
and get to yondering.

07:20.333 --> 07:23.416
Oh, and can you wipe the dong blood
off the table?

07:23.416 --> 07:26.333
This whole room
smells like chicken ceviche.

07:27.125 --> 07:30.833
Why do I have to wear this stuff?
It belongs to your brother-in-law.

07:30.833 --> 07:35.083
Because, Joe, I'm the brains,
and you're the bug murderer, okay?

07:35.083 --> 07:37.250
- That's always been our dynamic.
- I guess.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.625
Good. Now, let's send these crabs
back to hell.

07:42.791 --> 07:45.541
Holy shit, Emmy's crabs are huge.

07:45.541 --> 07:48.166
Uh, I don't think this spray
is gonna do anything.

07:48.166 --> 07:52.041
Let's just pump and dump, Joe, all right?
Get some balls together.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.708
Uh, okay. Uh, excuse me, everyone?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.333
Time to make your peace with God.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.708
Oh, it's broken. Did you test it?

07:59.708 --> 08:02.208
It's not broken. Just squeeze the thing.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.875
Of course we primed the nozzle.
You primed the nozzle, right, Joe?

08:05.791 --> 08:08.000
Wow, actually,
a little demo would be great.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.541
No, Joe, don't!

08:11.333 --> 08:15.291
- Oh God, it went in my mouth.
- Me too. It's making my gum taste weird.

08:15.291 --> 08:17.875
No, no, no, no, no, wait! Damn it, Joe.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.375
Okay, I think maybe
we're out of our depth here.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.250
Wrong. We just need
to adjust our strategy.

08:23.250 --> 08:27.250
But lucky for you,
the brains, me, has a new plan.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.250
- Is it dangerous?
- Not for me, no.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.208
But think of that bottom half of the bagel
you're gonna get when this is all done.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.708
Okay, but wait, the bottom half
of an everything bagel

08:35.708 --> 08:37.083
is just a plain bagel.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.958
Nah, nah, both halves are the same.

08:38.958 --> 08:42.416
And-- And who cares which you get?
Honestly, I'm jealous you get the bottom.

08:42.416 --> 08:44.500
- You wanna switch?
- No.

08:47.916 --> 08:50.833
Oh, this hat is so big. I feel ridiculous.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.333
Paul? Evelyn got you that hat.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.958
She said it made you look
like Daniel Stern from <i>City Slickers,</i>

08:56.958 --> 08:58.750
a movie I will never see.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.875
Oh, look at me. What a dope.
I booked the middle seat.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.958
Why do you do stuff like this, Paul?

09:03.958 --> 09:06.458
Aw, you did it out of habit.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.333
Evelyn always took the aisle
because she loved to hydrate.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.208
Oh, yeah, and she had
such a small, delicate bladder.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.750
Paul, this trip was a terrible idea.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.666
You're not ready to travel
without Evelyn.

09:17.666 --> 09:18.583
Oh, God.

09:18.583 --> 09:21.333
Who's gonna watch your bag
when you have to poop at the airport?

09:21.333 --> 09:24.750
I'm gonna have to bring it into the stall
with all the fecal particles.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.166
No, no, no,
you're gonna have a wonderful trip.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.291
Indeed, Paul.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.500
It's fun being alive, isn't it?

09:31.500 --> 09:35.708
I'd ask sweet Evelyn, but her phone's
going straight to voicemail.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.833
- Goddamn it, Lionel.
- 'Cause she's dead.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.833
Oh, God, what am I doing
taking this vacation?

09:40.833 --> 09:43.166
I told you assholes not to come.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.833
No, the Mosquito and the Wizard are right.
I can't do this. I-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

09:47.833 --> 09:50.000
Paul, look at me.
What the fuck are you doing?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.875
No, this trip, it's a bad idea.
I shouldn't go.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.125
- I have so much to do at home.
- Paul, sit down.

09:55.125 --> 09:58.416
What if the basement floods again?
Or what if an owl gets into my attic?

09:58.416 --> 10:01.291
- What if--?
- Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.833
Let's just remember why we're going.

10:03.833 --> 10:06.875
Look at her. She loved the Southwest.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.250
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.

10:09.250 --> 10:12.750
Evelyn would've wanted me
to do this alone, right?

10:12.750 --> 10:14.750
Ugh, she sure would have.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.875
Well, I think she would've wanted

10:16.875 --> 10:19.833
her dermatologist
to be a little more on the ball,

10:19.833 --> 10:22.750
but we can't ask her, can we? Boop!

10:23.375 --> 10:25.083
Uh, hello?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.666
Mr. Whisperer?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.833
I'm here about murdering a dick.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.166
Easy, Pete.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.875
Ixnay on the pecker slaughter.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.291
Maury? You're the Dick Whisperer?

10:36.291 --> 10:38.166
Why didn't Connie tell me it was you?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.125
'Cause I'm not supposed
to have these up here.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.750
Oh, hey, settle down, fellas.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.541
It's all right.
He's our guest. You're safe.

10:44.541 --> 10:45.958
I need your help.

10:45.958 --> 10:48.291
Dante's severed, um... [whispering] penis...

10:48.291 --> 10:49.875
Thank you for whispering that part.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.666
It keeps coming back to life.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.875
And I was told that
you could help me kill it for good.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.083
- Kill it?
- Yeah.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.291
So, uh, what's the trick? Fire? Ice?

10:57.291 --> 10:59.041
A very thin grenade
you jam in the peehole?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.791
I have bad news for you, Pete.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.541
You can't kill a zombie penis.

11:02.541 --> 11:05.250
You've got to tame it.
Form a bond with it.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.708
Love it like a daddy.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.250
I don't wanna love it
like a daddy.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.208
I wanna strap it to a rocket
and shoot it into the sun.

11:12.208 --> 11:17.291
That ain't gonna work, hoss.
These were all angry severed penises once.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.583
When I found this little sweetie,
he was completely feral.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.500
Foaming at the peehole,
chomping wildly at my nuts.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.333
- But it seems like it loves you.
- Well, now he does.

11:26.333 --> 11:30.000
Because I bared my soul to him
and confessed my innermost secrets.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.666
Here. Observe as I become vulnerable.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.625
Oh, my little friend, I must confess,

11:34.625 --> 11:37.958
Connie thinks that we both
fuck other people, but I don't.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.125
My body is hers, and hers alone. Mwah.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.875
- Hmm.
- Are you ready to do that, Pete?

11:42.875 --> 11:45.666
Bare your soul
and then kiss the tip of Dante's penis?

11:45.666 --> 11:49.375
No, I have nothing to confess
to that zombie dick,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.000
and I'm certainly not gonna kiss it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.125
Oh!

11:52.125 --> 11:54.875
Now-- Now's your chance, Pete!

11:54.875 --> 11:57.333
Speak your truth,
purse your lips.

11:57.333 --> 12:02.666
You want honesty? I did nothing wrong.
I was saving Dante's life.

12:02.666 --> 12:06.333
I had to cut you off.
The statue was too heavy to lift.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.750
I don't know, Pete. Seems like
you can lift stuff when you want to.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.875
And I'm very attracted to you right now.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.708
Uh, I don't know about this, Gil.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.958
Trust me, sweetheart. It's genius.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.166
You'll go deep undercover
with the crabs, okay?

12:24.166 --> 12:27.625
And then, when the time is right,
we take them down from the inside.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.000
And when you say "the time is right..."

12:30.000 --> 12:32.416
- It could be a week. Maybe months.
- Months?

12:32.416 --> 12:34.791
Just remember, whenever that day comes,

12:34.791 --> 12:38.458
that bottom half of a bagel
will be waiting for you.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.541
Showtime, baby.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.458
Whoa!

12:40.458 --> 12:42.291
W-What's up, fellas?

12:42.291 --> 12:44.291
You guys talking about pubes?

12:44.291 --> 12:46.625
Because, me, I freaking love 'em.

12:46.625 --> 12:51.000
I love eating them,
or maybe living in them.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.791
No, no, no! Oh, no, please don't kill me!
I didn't wanna do this.

12:55.791 --> 12:57.583
I told Gil it was a bad idea,

12:57.583 --> 12:59.416
but he didn't listen to me.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.541
Oh, Gil? He-- He's my best friend.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.875
Yeah, you're right.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.083
Friends <i>are</i> supposed to listen
to each other.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.791
And all this for a half a lousy bagel.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.500
Wait, you have homemade everything bagels?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.541
Yes, please.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.625
Mmm.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.916
Oh, delicious. And the chewy bits?

13:22.916 --> 13:26.208
You know, I'm not a big dried-blood guy,

13:26.208 --> 13:28.125
but with the pubic dander...

13:28.125 --> 13:30.166
I don't know,
it unlocks something. I love it.

13:33.875 --> 13:38.458
Ah, shoot. My sunscreen exploded.
I should've packed it in a plastic baggie.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.708
Who cares? We're on vacation.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.041
Ooh!

13:43.041 --> 13:44.500
There's Kathy and Dave.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.916
Hi, guys. My sunscreen blew up.

13:46.916 --> 13:50.333
Oh, Paul, it's good to see you.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.791
- This rain is something else, huh?
- Yeah.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.625
Yeah, rain in the desert.
I bet the plants are excited.

13:56.625 --> 14:01.000
Anyway, we should probably rain-check
our horseback ride tonight.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.875
Cancel the sunset ride?
But it's a tradition.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.958
And we were thinking we could try
that new bourbon distillery instead.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.583
Yeah, okay.
I guess that could maybe be fun.

14:10.583 --> 14:15.833
Paul, baby, you and Evelyn
always start this trip with a trail ride.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.375
Yeah. Right, right. But this weather--

14:18.375 --> 14:22.375
Paul, the memories. Think of Evelyn.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.541
Come on, slowpoke.

14:25.708 --> 14:30.791
Hey, guys, I, uh...
I-- I think we should still go riding.

14:30.791 --> 14:31.916
I don't wanna go riding.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.708
We have to.
His wife is dead.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.166
Sure. You got it, Paul.

14:37.166 --> 14:42.708
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go take some photos
of my hotel room on my... on my iPad.

14:42.708 --> 14:47.625
And I'm gonna go do stuff with the towels
that I would never do at home.

14:54.958 --> 14:56.791
I mean, there's really no point.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.041
See? Can't lift it.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.500
Okay, just a few dynamic stretches.

15:22.458 --> 15:23.833
Oh, fuck.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.750
No wonder that zombie penis
wants to kill me.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.416
I could have saved it.

15:29.916 --> 15:31.750
I mean, you can't even see the sunset.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.500
Dave, this is important for him.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.416
Look at what
you're putting your friends through, Paul.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.375
- Ow!
- It's an adventure.

15:38.958 --> 15:42.125
You and Evelyn loved adventures, right?

15:42.125 --> 15:47.208
We did. But you know, I'm pretty cold.
Maybe we should turn back?

15:47.208 --> 15:49.000
Or maybe you should just lay down and die!

15:49.000 --> 15:51.500
If the cold doesn't get you,
the wolves will.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.875
Hey, Mr. Apples.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.625
Do horses, uh, fight wolves?

15:56.583 --> 16:00.125
Hang in there, Paul.
We're almost at the vista.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.833
Remember the vista?

16:01.833 --> 16:04.041
I don't see the vista, Walter.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.250
I'm gonna show you the vista, honey.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.625
Oh God, that flickering.

16:07.625 --> 16:11.250
- It's making me nauseous.
- We're gonna freaking blow.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.375
Watch out ahead, Paul.
Trail gets pretty muddy.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.000
Oh!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.250
Shoot. Here we go!

16:19.250 --> 16:20.291
Oh, Paul!

16:20.291 --> 16:22.125
- Ow!
- God, are you okay?

16:22.125 --> 16:24.541
- I'm all right.
- Stop. Paul had an accident.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.541
Uh, just some mud. Yeah.

16:26.541 --> 16:28.833
And I sat in a... cactus.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.541
Oh, a couple of cactuses.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.708
Uh, I think it's "cacti."

16:32.708 --> 16:36.666
The only thing
that makes this dead-wife trip more fun

16:36.666 --> 16:39.000
is knowing we're on stolen lands.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.458
Oh, God. Oh, shit.
I hope his head's still intact.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.958
Hey, there you are.
Jesus, I was getting worried.

16:45.958 --> 16:46.916
Oh, really?

16:46.916 --> 16:50.666
Worried I wouldn't, you know,
do all the work and get you a bagel?

16:50.666 --> 16:52.541
What are you talking about?
This is all for us.

16:52.541 --> 16:55.458
- Yeah, right.
- O-O-Okay, so how's it going, huh?

16:55.458 --> 16:57.583
Have you sowed discord?
Fractured their ranks?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.583
Tell me you've at least
fractured their ranks!

16:59.583 --> 17:01.458
- Oh, yeah, they're divided.
- Go on.

17:01.458 --> 17:05.250
Okay, so half the crabs think
what the living room needs is an area rug.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.166
Okay...?

17:06.166 --> 17:09.708
But the rest of us,
we think it could really use a chair.

17:09.708 --> 17:11.875
-"We"?
- Maybe a papasan made of pubes.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.208
What are you talking about?

17:13.208 --> 17:16.166
We really think a statement chair would...

17:16.166 --> 17:18.791
Uh, how to say...

17:18.791 --> 17:20.625
Joe, wake up! You're not a crab.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.958
You're supposed to be taking them down
from the inside!

17:22.958 --> 17:25.750
- They're our enemy.
- Sure, but I got to know them, and...

17:26.666 --> 17:29.208
...and that "enemy" gave me a bagel.

17:29.208 --> 17:32.791
And it was the good half,
with all the blood and pubic dander on it.

17:32.791 --> 17:36.125
So, yeah, they listen, unlike you.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.666
- All right.
- You should listen to your friend.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.916
- Uh, I'm listening to you now, okay?
- Really?

17:40.916 --> 17:43.083
Yeah. O-Of course.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.041
This, what we've got,

17:45.041 --> 17:47.625
it's more important
than some stupid bagel.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.791
- Thanks, buddy.
- Get in here, you fuck.

17:49.791 --> 17:50.708
Oh!

17:50.708 --> 17:52.833
You know, it's funny.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.583
I guess I had to go make
some "pest" friends

17:55.583 --> 17:58.291
to learn what I needed
from my "best" friend.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.208
Okay.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.250
Come and get me, zombie penis.

18:27.083 --> 18:30.041
It's time you and I had a talk.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.541
So, you feeling all right?

18:32.541 --> 18:36.125
Oh, just a sore ego.
And a sore tush.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.500
I guess I'm not
quite the cowboy I remembered.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.541
Uh, are you still mixing up
your famous frozen margaritas, Paul?

18:42.541 --> 18:44.750
Uh, tequila gives me a headache.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.083
No, Evelyn was the, uh, margarita wiz.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.916
- Ah, I knew that. Sorry.
- Yeah.

18:48.916 --> 18:50.291
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.625
Remember when you moved in together?

18:52.625 --> 18:55.208
That blender
was the first thing she unpacked.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.958
So, Paul, now that you're retired...
...any big plans?

18:58.958 --> 19:01.666
Plans. Um, I... Plans?

19:01.666 --> 19:04.208
Yeah, you've got
all the time in the world now.

19:04.208 --> 19:07.083
Yeah, I suppose... I suppose I do.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.791
So, what's next?

19:08.791 --> 19:10.916
Yeah, I-- I-- I don't really know.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.625
Walter? What is next?

19:12.625 --> 19:13.958
Look at her.

19:13.958 --> 19:17.541
- She was the cutest pregnant lady ever.
- Walter?

19:17.541 --> 19:21.250
Bought a house, raised a family,
got a law degree.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.500
Walter! Did you hear what I said?

19:23.500 --> 19:26.208
What? Sorry, I was reminiscing.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.875
You're always reminiscing.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.416
Enough with the past.
What-- What about now?

19:30.416 --> 19:34.416
Pardon me, folks. How we doing?
You liking those green-chili enchiladas?

19:34.416 --> 19:37.625
- I have absolutely no idea.
- Okay...?

19:37.625 --> 19:39.791
I only ordered them because I always do.

19:39.791 --> 19:43.333
I'm chewing, I'm swallowing,
but I don't know if I like this.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.416
Sweetie, it's just an entrée.

19:45.416 --> 19:47.791
I don--
I don't know if I like any of this.

19:47.791 --> 19:49.583
I-- I-- I need some air.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.583
- Paul!
- He just lost his wife.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.500
My steak is great. Thank you.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.291
Emmy, we have great news.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.791
Oh, thank God.

20:00.791 --> 20:03.416
We've learned a lot about our friendship.

20:03.416 --> 20:06.750
Yup, and how I haven't
been listening to Joe.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.583
- Huh? What about the crabs?
- Oh, they were a big help, for sure.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.500
No! When can I go back
to living in my apartment?

20:12.500 --> 20:14.000
Ooh, they're not leaving.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.083
Not leaving?

20:15.083 --> 20:18.541
I mean, I-I actually learned they've lived
in the building longer than you have,

20:18.541 --> 20:20.333
so it's kinda rude you ever moved in.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.750
But they'd love to do whatever they can

20:23.750 --> 20:26.166
to help you get your shit outta there
as soon as possible.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.416
Fuck. I have to find a new place?

20:28.416 --> 20:29.958
Emmy, cheer up.

20:29.958 --> 20:34.291
Joe and I are better than ever.
You get to move, which is so fun.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.250
This is a win for everybody, hun.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.625
Yeah, everybody
except Gil's brother-in-law

20:38.625 --> 20:40.750
because his equipment is gone forever.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.333
What the fuck?
Why did I listen to you guys?

20:43.333 --> 20:45.291
I should have paid for exterminators.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.833
And now you know. Lesson learned.

20:47.833 --> 20:51.916
And, frankly, isn't a bagel
a small price to pay for that new wisdom?

20:51.916 --> 20:55.458
What? No. Fuck you two idiots.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.791
- Bitch!
- You think that's gonna stop me?

21:01.791 --> 21:03.583
I've been eating pubes all day.

21:03.583 --> 21:06.125
Yeah, if anything, I want it more now.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.000
Mm!

21:09.166 --> 21:13.375
All right, Maury says
I gotta be honest with you, so here goes.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.833
Deep down, I wanted to cut you off.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.000
Because I...

21:20.625 --> 21:22.458
I love Rochelle,

21:22.458 --> 21:25.125
and Dante's not good enough for her.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.541
I'm not always a good guy.

21:28.541 --> 21:32.541
I'm freakin' happy that I ruined his life
and his relationship.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.375
And I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

21:37.250 --> 21:41.583
So if you wanna rip my throat out,
go ahead, do it.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.458
Oh my God, it worked. It's licking me.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.000
I'm proud of you, Pete.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.416
- Maury, is it over?
- Almost.

21:52.416 --> 21:54.541
There's just one more thing
you have to do.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.000
Oh, fine.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.375
Oh, you kissed him.

21:59.375 --> 22:01.791
I meant you have to name him, but okay.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.583
Paul, honey, what's going on?

22:05.583 --> 22:08.666
- I hate Santa Fe.
- What?

22:08.666 --> 22:12.750
I'm not sure
I even like Kathy and Dave that much.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.833
Oh, this is silly talk.
They're your best friends.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.625
No, they were Evelyn's best friends.

22:18.625 --> 22:20.625
I have nothing in common with them.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.291
- You have Santa Fe.
- Don't you get it?

22:23.291 --> 22:26.583
I loved being here with Evelyn,

22:26.583 --> 22:28.791
but being here without her?

22:28.791 --> 22:29.916
It's miserable.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.750
But she is here with you. Look.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.791
No, no. Hey. That's it.

22:34.791 --> 22:36.916
Ah! Did you just hit me?

22:36.916 --> 22:40.833
Yes, and I'm sorry,
but you're making me feel like crap.

22:40.833 --> 22:45.791
Excuse me? I'm your Lovebug.
I'm the root of all happiness.

22:45.791 --> 22:49.250
But all you do is show me
memories of my late wife.

22:49.250 --> 22:53.458
I just don't want you to forget Evelyn.
Because I love you, Paul.

22:53.458 --> 22:57.875
Do you? Or do you just love the fact
that I was married to Evelyn?

22:57.875 --> 23:01.791
Can you tell me one thing, Walter,
that you love about me?

23:01.791 --> 23:03.958
- Of course.
- About Paul.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.583
I love how you, um...

23:06.583 --> 23:08.708
Let me show you.
I have decades of memories.

23:09.375 --> 23:13.500
Okay, that's Evelyn.
More Evelyn. Oh, dear.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.625
See? It's like Evelyn
was your client, not me.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.333
Well, I guess I just...

23:19.333 --> 23:21.500
I loved how you loved her,

23:21.500 --> 23:25.000
and I gave that my all
for 30 goddamn years.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.375
And now she's just...

23:27.375 --> 23:28.750
Gone.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.541
- She's gone.
- She is.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.083
- But I'm still here.
- You are.

23:34.083 --> 23:36.625
And I'm sorry. I do love you.

23:37.250 --> 23:41.041
I guess I just don't actually
know you very well.

23:41.041 --> 23:44.250
I know. I--
I don't know me very well either.

23:44.250 --> 23:49.250
But now that I'm on my own,
I guess I gotta figure out who I am.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.791
Hey, hey, hey, you ain't on your own.

23:52.708 --> 23:53.875
You got me.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.333
Thanks, Walter.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.041
We're gonna solve
the mystery of Paul together.

23:58.041 --> 24:01.083
Yeah. Who is Paul?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.583
Hopefully you like what you find.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.833
'Cause when you really take the time
to look at yourself,

24:04.833 --> 24:06.875
there's a good chance
you'll hate your own guts.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.000
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.500
The new Paul, and he sucks.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.958
Evelyn's favorite part of the desert?

24:11.958 --> 24:13.166
No mosquitos.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.625
Well done, Paul.

24:16.916 --> 24:21.541
Not today,
you bitch-ass vending-machine-ass bitch.

24:21.541 --> 24:24.416
Okay, Pete. You got this.

24:24.416 --> 24:27.291
"Hey, Rochelle, Mondays, right?"

24:27.291 --> 24:29.083
Perfect.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.166
- Uh, hey, Rochelle.
- Hey, Pete.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.125
Uh, Mondays, right?

24:34.125 --> 24:36.666
Uh, I-- I hate-- I hate Mondays.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.666
Yeah, same.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.041
Well, see you around.

24:42.291 --> 24:44.250
You know what?

24:44.250 --> 24:46.916
- Actually, I love Mondays.
- Okay.

24:46.916 --> 24:48.958
And to continue this radical honesty,

24:48.958 --> 24:51.625
I don't regret cutting off Dante's dick.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.625
Dante is a bad guy, and he's just--

24:53.625 --> 24:55.958
Pete, shut the fuck up about Dante, okay?

24:55.958 --> 24:57.875
- I don't wanna hear his name.
- Okay, okay.

24:57.875 --> 25:01.000
But I was just gonna say
that you deserve much better.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
You deserve a guy
who understands how incredible you are.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.458
- A guy who can--
- Look, Pete.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.750
I can see you trying
to put it all out there, or whatever,

25:07.750 --> 25:09.333
but with the week I've had,

25:09.333 --> 25:13.583
I don't wanna talk or think
or feel anything right now,

25:13.583 --> 25:15.708
so either fuck me or take a walk.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.750
Uh, I'm sorry. What was that?

25:17.750 --> 25:22.333
I said, either fuck me or take a walk.

25:22.333 --> 25:26.458
Um, okay, well, uh,
if given only the two options,

25:26.458 --> 25:28.916
I choose the first one.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.583
"Fuck me." Final answer.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.041
All right, then.
