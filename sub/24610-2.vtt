WEBVTT

00:10.547 --> 00:15.784
Oh, for... Asshooooooole!

00:15.818 --> 00:18.320
Why's everybody pissed at me?

00:18.355 --> 00:21.323
I'm the one with no parachute,
in a plane that can't land.

00:22.526 --> 00:24.826
- Which...
- Well?!

00:24.862 --> 00:29.297
- What do we do now?!
- I mean, pretty much just this!

00:29.333 --> 00:31.066
She means how do we land?!

00:31.101 --> 00:33.802
Oh. Yeah, that's
this whole big thing.

00:33.837 --> 00:35.557
<i>- What do you mean?!
- Gott im Himmel...</i>

00:35.592 --> 00:37.339
You need, like, training!

00:37.374 --> 00:39.074
<i>- So train us!
- Ja!</i>

00:39.076 --> 00:40.676
Okay, okay, uh....

00:40.677 --> 00:42.611
Okay, the first thing
you wanna do

00:42.646 --> 00:45.480
is get out your notebooks
and two number two pencils!

00:45.516 --> 00:47.249
<i>- What?!
- Was?!</i>

00:47.284 --> 00:49.651
Wait, shit, that was
the classroom portion...

00:49.686 --> 00:51.386
<i>- Gott verdamme dich!
- Which...</i>

00:51.388 --> 00:55.491
- I mean, even if we had pencils...
- Tell us what to do!

00:55.492 --> 00:57.526
Okay, when you're about
to hit the ground,

00:57.561 --> 00:59.261
you just kinda go limp!

00:59.296 --> 01:01.665
Limp?
Heh. Oh right, like this guy

01:01.700 --> 01:03.796
doesn't know what "limp" means,
am I right, ladies?

01:03.831 --> 01:06.201
- Crackerrrrs!
- Oh, my God...

01:06.236 --> 01:08.103
<i>- Was ist "limp"?!
- Relax!</i>

01:08.138 --> 01:11.406
- How?!
- It means relax!

01:11.442 --> 01:13.475
- Heh. Dipshit.
- Right?

01:13.510 --> 01:16.344
But can we get
a little more detail?!

01:16.380 --> 01:20.382
Jesus, lady, okay!
Your knees are kinda bent,

01:20.417 --> 01:21.884
and right
when you hit the ground,

01:21.885 --> 01:23.852
you relax
and just fall over sideways,

01:23.887 --> 01:26.588
and kinda roll
from your feet, up your legs,

01:26.623 --> 01:30.592
and then...
Well, shit.

01:30.627 --> 01:33.095
Okay, Princess Highpockets, you're up.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.063
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, waaaaiii...

01:36.467 --> 01:39.301
Jesus, people, how hard
is it to... Waaaaaaagh!

01:39.336 --> 01:41.203
<i>Ungh! Oof! Nnngh!</i>

01:41.238 --> 01:43.705
Oh, man. I had
something about, like...

01:43.740 --> 01:48.639
flying is for the birds?
No, it's gone.

01:56.186 --> 02:00.056
Goddamn it.
C'mon, ya son of a...

02:02.960 --> 02:06.062
- Idiocy.
- Hellllp!

02:06.063 --> 02:07.497
Get me down!

02:07.498 --> 02:09.231
- Shhhh!
- Now!

02:09.265 --> 02:12.834
I will but quit yelling.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.636
We're not currently

02:14.671 --> 02:16.738
- at the top of the food chain.
- Sorry!

02:16.773 --> 02:19.141
Now relax,
you're gonna be fine.

02:19.176 --> 02:22.878
- Helllllllp!
- Him, on the other hand...

02:24.214 --> 02:27.200
Heh. Yikes.
That's enough to make any guy

02:27.201 --> 02:29.688
go limp, am I right, ladies?

02:30.699 --> 02:33.456
- Shut up, bird.
- Eh.

03:16.534 --> 03:18.234
Well, you'd better.
It's a crime

03:18.236 --> 03:20.036
to harm a member
of the royal family!

03:20.071 --> 03:21.971
What, ya gonna arrest
the ground?

03:22.006 --> 03:24.941
- Oh, so you can crack wise, but...
- Bird?

03:24.976 --> 03:26.643
Okay...

03:26.644 --> 03:29.712
- One... two... threeeeek!
- Oof!

03:29.748 --> 03:33.883
My goodness.
I didn't realize you were so strong...

03:33.918 --> 03:37.220
Yeah, state cheese-toss
champ, five years runnin'.

03:37.255 --> 03:39.322
But don't get any ideas, sister.

03:39.357 --> 03:42.225
Wh... ?! Now, just
you wait one minute!

03:42.260 --> 03:44.260
Because what the hell
is a cheese toss?

03:44.295 --> 03:45.896
What, seriously?!

03:45.897 --> 03:48.231
<i>Verdammte Idioten!</i>

03:48.266 --> 03:53.035
- How do I get down from here?!
- I mean, you just  unbuckle it and.

03:53.071 --> 03:55.404
- Wh... ?! Are you mad?!
- No.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.242
- I will fall!
- You don't really have a choice!

03:59.277 --> 04:00.944
Of course I do!
I will stay here!

04:00.945 --> 04:05.048
- Mkay.
- What, no! We can't leave him here, he's...

04:05.049 --> 04:07.316
vital to our fledgling
breadfruit industry!

04:07.352 --> 04:09.552
Which is... fledgling!

04:09.587 --> 04:11.521
So then that's probably bad...

04:13.358 --> 04:15.025
Aw, man...

04:15.026 --> 04:17.994
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh,

04:18.029 --> 04:23.242
sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh,
sh, sh, schlaaaange!

04:25.303 --> 04:28.671
Hih, hih, hih, hih, hih, hiiiiiilfe!

04:28.706 --> 04:31.607
If it's not one frickin' thing
with you people, it's another.

04:31.643 --> 04:36.479
- Do you have a plan?
- I do, actually.

04:41.519 --> 04:43.686
Okay, Lucy, here's the plan...

04:43.721 --> 04:46.556
Mitimotu is here, but
with the wheels stuck down,

04:46.591 --> 04:50.726
the closest airstrip we can
land on is on Motu Papa... here.

04:50.762 --> 04:54.197
Which is west-northwest,
a heading of 295 degrees.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.132
Let's call it 320 nautical miles.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.734
Airspeed 110,
burn rate 50 per,

04:58.770 --> 05:02.271
call it 55 with the wheels down,
if we run it lean...

05:02.307 --> 05:04.307
and if the fuel pump holds,

05:04.342 --> 05:06.976
'cause if it doesn't,
none of this shit matters...

05:07.011 --> 05:09.078
tailwind is 5...

05:09.113 --> 05:12.248
fuel-weight ratio, rho times alpha,
then lift-to-drag,

05:12.283 --> 05:15.418
where W is force in newtons,
which means...

05:15.453 --> 05:18.554
if we catch a few breaks
and the tailwind holds,

05:18.590 --> 05:21.825
our maximum range is...
Goddamn it!

05:21.826 --> 05:24.493
Rrrraagh!

05:24.529 --> 05:27.196
Great. Now that's broken.

05:27.232 --> 05:31.868
Zat cannot be your plan!

05:31.903 --> 05:34.937
Well, if you'd hit the stupid
buckle when I told you to...

05:36.941 --> 05:39.075
That's his tongue
on my face, isn't it?

05:39.110 --> 05:41.277
Okay, Fritz, hang tight...

05:41.312 --> 05:42.779
- Badumbump.
- Bird?

05:42.780 --> 05:44.448
You can't shoot the snake!

05:44.449 --> 05:46.482
Why not?!
They slither into our nests,

05:46.517 --> 05:49.018
they eat our eggs,
they eat our chicks!

05:49.053 --> 05:53.023
- I meant. She could hit Fuchs.
- I stand by my statement.

05:53.024 --> 05:55.626
Don't worry, Princess,
I'm not shootin' at the snake...

05:55.627 --> 05:57.127
<i>Warte, was?!</i>

05:57.128 --> 05:58.861
Nein, nein, nein,
nein, nein, nein...

06:02.934 --> 06:04.334
Neeeeeeiiiiiiinnngh!

06:21.819 --> 06:23.519
<i>- Oh, man!
- Santa mierda.</i>

06:24.622 --> 06:27.557
- Is he...?
- I mean...

06:27.558 --> 06:32.295
Get me...
ze hell out of heeerrre!

06:34.299 --> 06:36.832
<i>Bien sûr, mon amie,
avec plaisir.</i>

06:36.868 --> 06:41.304
- Don't you want to know why?
- Non. Just how much.

06:41.339 --> 06:43.773
<i>Quelle chance.
The perfect amount.</i>

06:43.808 --> 06:45.275
<i>Après toi.</i>

06:45.276 --> 06:47.209
But since you mentioned "why"...

06:47.245 --> 06:50.579
Oh, but "why" is such
a troublesome question,

06:50.615 --> 06:52.049
though, don't you agree?

06:52.050 --> 06:54.383
I mean, once you start
pulling threads,

06:54.419 --> 06:56.319
there's no telling where it'll end.

06:56.354 --> 06:59.155
One minute you're wearing
a lovely cable-knit sweater,

06:59.190 --> 07:01.424
and the next there's a pile
of yarn on the floor,

07:01.459 --> 07:03.426
and you're standing there...

07:05.296 --> 07:09.410
Jesus "What Is The H. For" Christ...

07:11.903 --> 07:15.494
And you can keep
your stupid turnip...

07:21.746 --> 07:24.417
I'm not hungry.

07:27.366 --> 07:29.833
<i>- Mes bonbons!
- Your what?! </i>

07:30.769 --> 07:33.604
<i>Cochon stupide!
Qu'est-ce que tu as fait?!</i>

07:33.605 --> 07:35.195
<i>C'était un cadeau de ma mère!</i>

07:35.230 --> 07:36.407
<i>- You...
- De Paris!</i>

07:36.408 --> 07:38.508
<i>C'était! De! Paris!</i>

07:38.544 --> 07:43.080
- You said I could have one!
- Yes, one! One, you... cow bitch!

07:43.115 --> 07:45.115
I didn't know
which one I wanted!

07:47.841 --> 07:49.220
Out!

07:49.221 --> 07:50.721
- What?
- Out! Out, out, out, out, out, out, out!

07:50.722 --> 07:53.123
No!
It's some kind of ruse,

07:53.158 --> 07:54.858
you're going to shoot me
in the back, or, or...

07:54.893 --> 07:58.479
It's not a ruse, I paid your bail!

07:58.964 --> 08:02.056
Oh. Well then.

08:03.569 --> 08:08.464
- Hmph.
- But now wait a minute, Miss Thing...

08:09.675 --> 08:12.336
<i>On n'a plus besoin de navet!</i>

08:18.617 --> 08:21.818
Hey, come on...
Chin up, Archer...

08:21.853 --> 08:23.387
Y-You've been in tougher scrapes.

08:23.388 --> 08:25.188
Huh?
Remember the Andes?

08:25.224 --> 08:26.557
Paso de Muerte?

08:26.558 --> 08:30.004
C'mon, death was
right there in the name.

08:30.039 --> 08:34.097
All those dogfights over Spain
against the Condor Legion? Remember?

08:34.099 --> 08:36.600
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.437
So if the Andes couldn't kill me,

08:40.472 --> 08:41.972
and the krauts couldn't kill me,

08:41.974 --> 08:44.441
I mean, I know
it's kinda hard to grasp, but...

08:44.476 --> 08:47.444
I might be immortal.

08:47.479 --> 08:52.482
I! Am! Immortal!

08:52.517 --> 08:56.519
Jesus Christ...

08:56.555 --> 09:01.021
- I am dying!
- Shut up, you're not dying,

09:01.056 --> 09:02.225
you just got a couple busted ribs.

09:02.261 --> 09:04.127
And probably a punctured lung.

09:04.162 --> 09:05.496
<i>- Was?!
- Bird?!</i>

09:05.497 --> 09:08.165
- What, we were all thinking it.
- No one is thinking that!

09:08.166 --> 09:10.300
- He is.
- Ja, I am now!

09:10.335 --> 09:12.135
See?!

09:12.170 --> 09:15.706
I feel like,
if I have to remind you people

09:15.707 --> 09:17.407
how much you need
to shut the hell up,

09:17.442 --> 09:19.442
I'm gonna lose my temper!

09:19.478 --> 09:21.511
Well, and I think I speak
for the group,

09:21.546 --> 09:23.413
I feel like you already have.

09:23.448 --> 09:25.049
- Ja, und me also.
- So do I, actually.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.917
Well, if you think I'm mad now?

09:27.953 --> 09:30.620
Wait 'til I'm gettin'
shit out of a dragon.

09:30.656 --> 09:31.822
- Wait, what?
- Huh? Was?

09:31.823 --> 09:32.990
Ahem.

09:32.991 --> 09:34.659
<i>- Oka atua!
- Holy birdshit!</i>

09:34.660 --> 09:35.793
<i>Was?! Was ist los?!</i>

09:35.794 --> 09:40.363
Yeah, so listen, I'm probably
gonna head out? Grrrk!

09:40.399 --> 09:46.936
- But then what would I use for bait?
- Cheese?

09:46.972 --> 09:52.375
There we are, a nice cool
glass of pastis, to...

09:52.411 --> 09:54.111
whet the appetite.

09:54.112 --> 09:56.980
- For what?
- New experiences?

09:57.015 --> 10:00.050
- You realize I can't pay for this.
- Mm-hmm...

10:00.085 --> 10:02.052
Or pay you back
for bailing me out.

10:02.087 --> 10:05.322
Which reminds me,
why'd you do that?

10:05.357 --> 10:08.191
Well, you said it yourself,
you're stranded here,

10:08.226 --> 10:10.860
abandoned by the husband
you cuckolded,

10:10.896 --> 10:14.698
thousands of miles from New York,
where you're a disgrace,

10:14.733 --> 10:18.602
- an outcast, a laughingstock...
- All right. Jesus.

10:18.603 --> 10:21.071
...you're a vagrant,
without a franc to your name,

10:21.106 --> 10:23.640
so Reynaud can arrest you
again whenever he wants,

10:23.675 --> 10:26.743
and I doubt he'd lose
much sleep over it...

10:26.778 --> 10:29.680
<i>Framboise...
noix de coco...</i>

10:29.681 --> 10:32.316
<i>cerise...</i>

10:32.317 --> 10:33.851
<i>Noisette!</i>

10:33.852 --> 10:37.387
And so, even if you had
a passport and a ticket out,

10:37.422 --> 10:40.824
if you're sitting in that rich,
chocolatey jail cell...

10:40.859 --> 10:45.528
- I could be stuck here... forever!
- Exactly.

10:45.564 --> 10:48.598
So why not make the most of it?

10:49.968 --> 10:54.437
I mean, it's not like
you really have a choice, so...

10:58.377 --> 11:01.411
Plus, maybe you really are immortal.

11:03.148 --> 11:04.948
That'd explain a lot.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.155
- You want me to be a whore?!
- No, not a whore!

11:12.190 --> 11:17.160
Good heavens, no, you'd be
more like... a courtesan.

11:17.195 --> 11:20.697
- Whom men pay for sex!
- And sparkling conversation.

11:20.732 --> 11:23.600
- I...
- And not just men, necessarily...

11:23.635 --> 11:25.535
- What?!
- ...and actually they'd pay me...

11:25.570 --> 11:27.937
- Pfft!
- ...and then I'd pay you.

11:27.973 --> 11:30.373
- A percentage.
- A percentage?!

11:30.409 --> 11:32.142
Let's call it...

11:32.177 --> 11:35.445
Forty-nine feet!
Wingtip to wingtip!

11:35.480 --> 11:39.516
And I bet that's 50-feet wide. Right?
Yeah, I bet that's 50...

11:39.551 --> 11:42.986
Which means we've got six inches
to spare on both sides, Lucy.

11:43.021 --> 11:46.589
And you know I can do
a lot with six inches!

11:46.625 --> 11:50.059
Badum-pssh.
Huh? Am I right, Luce?

11:50.095 --> 11:52.425
Lucy, am I right?

11:55.534 --> 11:58.468
Luce. Lucy...

11:58.503 --> 12:02.038
♪ Lucille Goosille. ♪

12:02.073 --> 12:04.474
Oh, okay,
so then I guess just pout!

12:04.509 --> 12:07.210
But I would think it goes
without saying, that it's

12:07.245 --> 12:11.481
also in your best interest
if we don't crash and burn!

12:14.786 --> 12:17.221
Thank you!
Jesus, was that so har...

12:22.210 --> 12:24.260
You fat bitch.

12:27.232 --> 12:28.899
<i> Fette Schlampe...</i>

12:28.900 --> 12:32.936
- That better mean "Thank you."
- Nngh! It does not.

12:32.971 --> 12:34.572
That's okay, you can thank me

12:34.573 --> 12:36.306
if we get out of this with our skin on.

12:36.341 --> 12:38.575
Which, what is taking you so long?!

12:38.610 --> 12:40.211
Okay, hold your damn horses!

12:40.212 --> 12:42.979
- Here!
- Nein! I don't want zis!

12:43.715 --> 12:45.716
Nobody wants any of this.

12:45.717 --> 12:47.750
But everybody is gonna do their bit!

12:47.786 --> 12:49.752
Starting with you.
Get up in those trees

12:49.788 --> 12:52.989
- and gimme some aerial recon.
- Yep! Yep, yep, yep!

12:53.024 --> 12:56.726
And if you leave us here,
I will find you, I will pluck you,

12:56.761 --> 12:59.362
I will slather your bumpy skin
with olive oil and rosemary,

12:59.397 --> 13:02.232
and then I will shove
a beer can up your asshole,

13:02.267 --> 13:05.586
and roast your ancient carcass
until it is golden brown

13:05.587 --> 13:08.806
- and goddamn delicious.
- Yep.

13:08.807 --> 13:10.507
And how old are you, anyway?

13:10.509 --> 13:14.044
- Like, forty?
- Eh.

13:15.413 --> 13:18.515
Man, I had something about...

13:18.550 --> 13:21.084
dead-stick... something?

13:21.119 --> 13:23.386
No, it's gone.

13:23.421 --> 13:26.389
Okay, Luce, it's now or never.

13:26.424 --> 13:29.192
- Never!
- Oh, all right, sixty-forty!

13:29.227 --> 13:31.694
That... No!
I will not be your whore!

13:31.730 --> 13:33.663
- Courtesan!
- Whatever! I won't do it!

13:33.698 --> 13:36.132
- Because you will be in my jail!
- What?!

13:36.167 --> 13:38.468
Unless you can show me
100 francs

13:38.503 --> 13:41.805
- or proof of onward voyage!
- You know I don't have either!

13:41.806 --> 13:43.973
And I do not have my bonbons!

13:44.009 --> 13:46.075
<i>And so, madame... aprez-vous.</i>

13:46.111 --> 13:48.845
And what if I say "no?"

13:48.880 --> 13:51.982
<i>- Sacre bleu!
- Jesus Christ!</i>

13:57.022 --> 14:02.972
Son of a... biiiiiiiiitch!

14:03.595 --> 14:05.595
<i>Mon Dieu!
C'est le volcane!</i>

14:05.630 --> 14:07.897
It's not the volcano, you idiot!

14:07.933 --> 14:11.367
I hate this stupid islaaaand!

14:32.991 --> 14:35.458
- Jesus Christ.
- Ow...

14:35.493 --> 14:37.860
So hey...

14:37.896 --> 14:39.929
- What now?
- Sterling!

14:39.965 --> 14:41.565
Shut up, quick question,

14:41.566 --> 14:44.033
how wide is the, uh,
the street out there?

14:44.069 --> 14:48.206
- Forty feet?
- Mm-hmm.

14:49.174 --> 14:53.273
Speaking of, you're good with 40?

14:57.718 --> 14:59.818
Oh, good, he's coming to.

14:59.853 --> 15:03.789
- Hooray.
- Oh, shut up. And you, give him some air.

15:03.824 --> 15:07.959
Airspeed! Nose up!
Flaps! Flaps!

15:10.971 --> 15:13.945
Holy shit, I really am immortal.

15:14.434 --> 15:16.201
And also in serious trouble!

15:16.236 --> 15:19.104
Shut up. Where's Pam?
She's gonna love this.

15:19.139 --> 15:22.474
She... There was nobody
on the plane.

15:22.509 --> 15:24.476
So where is la princesse?!

15:24.511 --> 15:26.845
Wait, no, no, no, they...
they bailed out.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.914
Jesus Christ,
how long was I out?!

15:28.949 --> 15:30.949
- One hour?
- Flew by.

15:30.984 --> 15:33.118
Oh my God, so they're
out there in the jungle.

15:33.153 --> 15:35.922
<i>- In the dark?!
- Mon Dieu.</i>

15:35.923 --> 15:39.658
So, what happens on Shithole
Island when it gets dark?

15:39.693 --> 15:41.927
On three, I start blasting.

15:46.033 --> 15:49.029
One... two...

15:50.938 --> 15:56.541
- Goddamn it.
- I am genuinely sorry.

15:56.577 --> 15:58.977
But I am absolutely
commandeering your vehicle, so...

15:59.012 --> 16:03.515
- No, I forbid you! You are insane!
- Hm, your concerns are noted.

16:03.550 --> 16:05.718
<i>Putain!
Oof!</i>

16:05.719 --> 16:09.121
- Great.
- Sterling! Be careful!

16:09.122 --> 16:14.380
- No!
- Okay, one, two...

16:15.662 --> 16:18.330
Everybody try not to take
a big greasy shit on me...

16:18.365 --> 16:21.234
- Ya know what?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:21.235 --> 16:23.768
What?!

16:23.804 --> 16:25.238
What if they're like sharks?

16:25.239 --> 16:26.939
- They are!
- Right?

16:26.974 --> 16:29.574
No, what if when you shoot one,

16:29.610 --> 16:33.211
the smell of its blood sends the
others into a feeding frenzy?

16:33.247 --> 16:36.214
- I'm gonna shoot the others.
- No. All the others.

16:37.951 --> 16:39.352
Like if they
can smell one drop of blood

16:39.353 --> 16:41.953
<i>- from miles and miles away...
- Mein Gott.</i>

16:41.989 --> 16:44.122
There could be hundreds
of them out there.

16:44.157 --> 16:46.124
- Thousands!
- Who gives a shit?!

16:47.628 --> 16:49.161
<i>- Was?
- Me!</i>

16:49.162 --> 16:51.229
- First of all, they're not like sharks...
- Ehh...

16:51.265 --> 16:52.965
In that way!
And second of all,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.876
any one of these big bastards
could kill you! And the rest

16:56.911 --> 16:59.271
of 'em are just gonna be
fightin' over your dead-ass bones!

16:59.306 --> 17:00.606
- Well...
- I dunno...

17:00.607 --> 17:02.941
- I vote we take a vote.
- Second.

17:02.976 --> 17:05.810
I swear to God...

17:05.846 --> 17:07.779
<i>Where are we going?!</i>

17:07.814 --> 17:10.315
Well, they bailed out
south of Tarako, so...

17:10.349 --> 17:12.617
<i>Le volcan?!
Attention!</i>

17:12.653 --> 17:16.320
- You must slow down!
- Oh, this piece of shit can go slower?!

17:16.356 --> 17:20.125
<i>Of course, you...
Oh, le sarcasme.</i>

17:20.160 --> 17:21.794
<i>Cognate! Nice!</i>

17:23.463 --> 17:25.097
Anyway, if nobody's hurt

17:25.098 --> 17:26.865
and Pam's got 'em headed
in the right direction,

17:26.900 --> 17:28.967
they should run right into this trail.

17:29.002 --> 17:33.172
If the serpents and lizards and
cannibals don't run into them first!

17:33.173 --> 17:34.540
Yeah, seems like a shitty place

17:34.541 --> 17:36.341
for a breadfruit plantation, huh?

17:36.376 --> 17:38.243
- Breadfruit? Here?
- Right?

17:38.278 --> 17:40.078
That's what I...

17:40.113 --> 17:42.426
Oh, shit!

17:44.918 --> 17:46.685
Aaaaaaghhhhhh!

17:49.990 --> 17:51.856
- I'm out!
- We were supposed to vote!

17:51.892 --> 17:53.758
I voted no!
Reloading!

17:57.597 --> 17:59.364
Oh man, there's
even more of 'em!

17:59.399 --> 18:02.000
<i>- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
- Gott im Himmel!</i>

18:02.035 --> 18:05.571
Nothing is worth this!
I don't care about the idol!

18:05.572 --> 18:06.706
- Do what?
- What idol?

18:06.707 --> 18:08.107
What? Wait, what, no.

18:08.108 --> 18:10.642
He said look... ooooouuut!

18:12.012 --> 18:13.546
Loaded!

18:16.650 --> 18:20.352
- Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!
- They're everywhere!

18:20.387 --> 18:21.854
What the
hell's in those bullets?

18:21.855 --> 18:23.722
- Reloading!
- Lizard pheromones?!

18:23.757 --> 18:26.859
I don't think so.
Loaded!

18:31.932 --> 18:34.967
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- Get in!

18:34.968 --> 18:38.172
Oh, right.
Heavy barrellllll!

18:38.205 --> 18:42.240
- Take that, lizard!
- And that!

18:49.816 --> 18:54.185
- Okay, we're in! Go!
- Whooooo!

18:54.221 --> 18:55.888
_

18:55.889 --> 18:58.357
- Slow down!
- Oh, my God, all right.

19:01.895 --> 19:03.661
Oh, just like old days.

19:05.399 --> 19:06.966
Oh, okay.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.334
Yeah, so, I guess
no thanks necessary.

19:09.369 --> 19:10.636
<i>- Danke, danke...
- "Thank you!"</i>

19:10.637 --> 19:12.337
- Well, I mean...
- Bird?

19:12.339 --> 19:14.372
But... how did you find us?

19:14.408 --> 19:16.374
I dunno... just lucky, I guess.

19:16.410 --> 19:17.676
<i>Grace à Dieu...</i>

19:17.677 --> 19:19.811
And wait, where did you land?

19:19.846 --> 19:24.261
Heh. Oh man, Pam,
speaking of luck...

19:30.123 --> 19:31.990
So, you're all lined up,

19:32.025 --> 19:33.725
thinking, I've got 50
feet to work with...

19:33.727 --> 19:35.460
And I'm just 49, tip to tip...

19:35.495 --> 19:38.898
- And of course the fuel pump's out...
- Yeah, so I'm, ya know...

19:38.899 --> 19:40.399
- Dead-stickin' it!
- Right?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.367
Yeah, so,
but then you slam a wing

19:42.402 --> 19:44.169
into that first tree down there,

19:44.204 --> 19:46.471
and then it just sorta
shitstorms on ya...

19:46.506 --> 19:49.271
- Well, yeah, because...
- Because any asshole

19:49.365 --> 19:51.476
could tell that this street is
not 50 feet wide,

19:51.511 --> 19:55.814
and even if it was, that only gives
you 6 frickin' inches to spare!

19:55.849 --> 19:58.750
Right? And I actually had
something for that, about, like...

19:58.785 --> 20:01.786
doing a lot with six inches,
or like, it was like...

20:01.822 --> 20:04.422
Like, what if you'd fixed
the goddamn fuel pump

20:04.458 --> 20:06.125
so the crash never happened?!

20:06.126 --> 20:10.462
Mmm-no, it was more
like a dick jo... Oof.

20:11.031 --> 20:12.731
Yeah.

20:18.638 --> 20:21.039
Funny stuff.
