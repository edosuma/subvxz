00:11.471 --> 00:15.975
<i>NARRATOR".
A warm, serene afternoon in Gotham City.</i>

00:16.184 --> 00:19.938
<i>The merest hint of a breeze
ruffles the leaves...</i>

00:20.146 --> 00:23.608
<i>...of the majestic trees
that inhabit the back lawn...</i>

00:23.816 --> 00:25.276
<i>...of stately Wayne Manor.</i>

00:25.485 --> 00:30.573
<i>Scarcely the moment
for crime to rear its ugly head.</i>

00:30.782 --> 00:35.078
Press on, merry marksmen.
We've much to do ere night descends. Hyah!

00:46.381 --> 00:49.634
I've run it up the flagpole
back at home base, Mr. Wayne...

00:49.842 --> 00:52.053
...and I'm not sure
we should award the money...

00:52.262 --> 00:54.472
...to the poor denizens of Gotham City.
-No?

00:54.681 --> 00:58.142
As administrative head of public relations,
I recommend against it.

00:58.351 --> 01:01.980
You realize, Mr. Dale, that the foundation
had already decided for it.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.025
But with this arch Archer criminal...

01:06.234 --> 01:08.820
...traversing our byways...
-Oh, yes, Archer.

01:09.028 --> 01:12.323
...I wonder if that much cash will be safe.

01:12.615 --> 01:15.618
Mr. Dale, as chief trustee
of the Wayne Foundation...

01:15.827 --> 01:18.454
...I can assure you that it is entirely safe.

01:18.663 --> 01:22.000
Gotham City is in no danger from criminals.

01:31.593 --> 01:34.137
Stand back whilst I have at it.

01:34.345 --> 01:38.474
The legal tender awaits our liberation.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.666
- Do we take our leave?
-The quicker the more advisable, sire.

02:13.718 --> 02:15.470
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

02:15.678 --> 02:16.763
Well put, sire.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.016
A quote from some obscure playwright.

02:40.495 --> 02:43.498
Thank you, Archer.
You've kept the wolf from our door.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.918
You're all heart and a yard wide, Big John.

02:47.085 --> 02:49.879
Aw, bless the ground
that you cry on, Mr. Tuck.

02:51.506 --> 02:52.924
Uh-oh.

02:55.301 --> 02:58.846
Egads! We are on the verge of incarceration.

03:01.557 --> 03:02.600
<i>Fear not...</i>

03:02.809 --> 03:06.229
...for I have prepared a sneezing powder arrow
to harangue their nostrils.

03:10.692 --> 03:13.945
Let us make our egress
with the utmost dispatch. Hyah!

03:23.871 --> 03:27.125
I shall secure him without further delay, sir.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.795
Was, uh, anyone hurt?

03:31.003 --> 03:34.757
No, it was a rather mild gas
with hardly any aftereffects.

03:34.966 --> 03:37.468
Our butler, Alfred, was out shopping
for the morning...

03:37.677 --> 03:39.595
...and revived us with smelling salts.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.474
There's that little business in the study, sir.

03:43.683 --> 03:45.268
- Oh, yes.
-Golly.

03:45.476 --> 03:49.021
- Uh, please excuse us, Chief O'Hara.
-Yes, yes.

03:57.363 --> 03:58.406
Yes, commissioner.

03:58.614 --> 04:02.076
I've heard from Chief O'Hara
that The Archer, that rapacious rapscallion...

04:02.285 --> 04:04.746
...has returned to taunt the people
of Gotham City.

04:04.954 --> 04:09.167
- Yes, and he robbed the home of Bruce Wayne.
-How did you know about that, Batman?

04:09.375 --> 04:12.628
It's my business to know.
We'll come right in.

04:12.837 --> 04:14.756
To the Batpoles.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.272
- They distributed the money to the poor?
-Most of it has already been turned in.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.025
Once the people of Gotham City knew
it was stolen, they wanted no part of it.

05:58.234 --> 06:01.612
A tribute to their character and moral fiber.

06:01.821 --> 06:04.866
This Archer seems to have you at his mercy.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.034
That malfeasant marksman.

06:07.243 --> 06:10.121
I'm going to tell the trustees
at the Wayne Foundation...

06:10.329 --> 06:12.498
...not to make the proposed grant.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.626
- Why not?
-We're chatting about $10 million...

06:15.835 --> 06:19.755
...in cash money being distributed
through our annual poverty program.

06:19.964 --> 06:23.509
We must make sure that the millions
won't end up in the hands...

06:23.718 --> 06:24.802
...of that blackguard.

06:25.011 --> 06:27.805
The Wayne Foundation
is doing a wonderful job...

06:28.014 --> 06:30.391
...supplementing
the administration's policies.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.810
And with Batman and Robin on our side...

06:33.019 --> 06:37.523
...you can be sure no harm
will befall that money.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.110
Stand back, everybody.
This could be one of Archer's tricks.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.905
- Oh, my eyes!
- I'm blinded!

06:51.120 --> 06:55.374
- I'm blind, sir. I'm blind.
- I can't see. My eyes. I'm blinded.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.126
- Blackguard!
- Chief!

06:57.335 --> 06:59.045
Now heed this.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.505
I'm gonna rob from the rich
and give to the poor.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.007
How unoriginal.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.968
- I came to warn thee, all of thee.
- I can't see a thing.

07:06.177 --> 07:09.513
I don't want anybody interfering
with my robbing or giving, understand?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.975
Or the poor people in Gotham City
will rise up and revolt.

07:13.184 --> 07:16.938
To them, I am the spirit of benevolence
and I will brook no interference.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.398
- Let's get him, Batman.
- Get back, I say!

07:19.607 --> 07:21.150
Let us depart, Archer.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.736
We've nary an excess moment.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.573
Batman, where are you?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.502
A fond cheerio.

07:40.252 --> 07:44.840
A bit of a tweet-tweet, and a pip-pip
and pleasant dreams.

07:47.343 --> 07:50.972
There they go around the corner.
Let's see if we can catch them.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.568
He certainly is a spectacular man.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.822
That he is.
And the Boy Wonder is pretty good too.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.992
I was talking about The Archer.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.285
A good publicity campaign...

08:13.494 --> 08:16.998
...and he'd replace Batman
as the public's favorite.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.667
Understand this, Mr. Dale.

08:19.875 --> 08:25.756
Someone might be able to substitute
for Batman for a very short time...

08:26.132 --> 08:29.468
...but no one could ever replace him.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.888
That Archer sure is a tough cookie, Batman.

08:33.097 --> 08:36.392
"Stale" is a better adjective, Robin.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.644
Hey, who are you?

08:38.852 --> 08:41.105
He must be new in Gotham City.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.356
He's from Philadelphia.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.317
- How did you know?
- You dipped your diphthong.

08:45.818 --> 08:48.446
People from Philadelphia are known for that.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.948
We're Batman and Robin, the crime-fighters.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.783
Are you a vocal group?

08:54.076 --> 08:55.202
I beg your pardon.

08:55.411 --> 08:59.040
I thought perhaps you might be a singing duo,
the, uh, outfits and all that.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.209
No, we're duly deputized officers of the law.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.336
You may return to your business, citizen.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.932
Holy Houdini! They've disappeared.

09:28.027 --> 09:29.070
Excuse me, miss.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.281
Have you seen three men on horseback
riding in this neighborhood?

09:32.490 --> 09:37.912
Three men on a horse
in downtown Gotham City, Batman?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.498
I think you've been working too hard.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.583
Thanks anyway, miss.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.680
Your marksmanship, for a fortnight now
we have robbed the rich and given to the poor.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.934
Aye, and with nary a doubloon
for our own pocket.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.269
Hath not the time arisen for personal profit?

10:02.478 --> 10:04.438
Patience and hold thy tongue.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.316
We have one more crime to commit
before the big caper.

10:07.525 --> 10:12.571
I wish youse guys would quit talking so funny
and get down to business.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.116
Batman and Robin will get youse...

10:15.324 --> 10:18.077
...and I'll have blown two weeks
driving a truck.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.498
Cease and desist, woman.
I have other things on my mind.

10:22.998 --> 10:29.088
I must devise a plan to pry the location
of the Batcave out of Batman and Robin.

10:29.255 --> 10:32.591
Uh, why doth that make any difference?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.553
It is rumored
that those caped sheriffs of Gothamham...

10:35.761 --> 10:39.140
...hath a machine
that can predict any criminal's next ploy.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.686
We must seize and destroy said machine
or suffer the consequences.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.605
Marilyn, call Commissioner Gordon.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.624
Yes, I've got it. The Archer
will be distributing money to poor people...

11:05.833 --> 11:10.379
...at the corner of Neptune Avenue
and Twentieth Street at precisely 4:00.

11:10.588 --> 11:13.048
Thank you for your help, miss.

11:14.550 --> 11:17.511
Well, O'Hara, this may be the break
we've been waiting for.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.681
Are you gonna call the Dynamic Duo, sir?

11:20.890 --> 11:21.974
Wouldn't you?

11:38.407 --> 11:39.950
Say, what is this?

11:40.117 --> 11:43.329
Mr. Bannister, thy time has come.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.916
If you didn't get your change back
from one of my candy machines...

11:47.124 --> 11:52.630
...take it up to the complaint department.
-Gentlemen, string thy bows.

11:55.132 --> 11:59.970
If it's about the coin shortage, I swear,
I'll put them back into circulation.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.223
Not nearly so fast as we shalt.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.184
- Now, sire?
-Now.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.871
Hey, everybody, come on now!

12:26.038 --> 12:27.581
Hooray for Archer!

12:39.969 --> 12:42.012
Come on, everybody. Boo the Batman.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.037
Come on, everybody. Boo it up.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.674
- Phooey on Batman.
-Batman.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.509
Batman!

13:20.926 --> 13:24.221
Phooey on Batman. Phooey.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.980
A fine bunch of creeps
youse guys turned out to be.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.858
With your fancy talk and everything.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.276
What ingratitude.

13:37.484 --> 13:41.613
That's what I get for aligning myself
with a kindergarten dropout.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.327
The town is in an uproar, Batman.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.746
The Archer has been glorified by everyone.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.541
And the poor folks have pooled their pennies
to make his bail.

13:52.750 --> 13:56.920
Fifty thousand smackers
in milk bottle deposit money...

13:57.129 --> 13:59.214
...which probably would have gone for food.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.842
Don't they understand
how he's trying to fool them?

14:02.051 --> 14:04.928
That elusive lure of easy living.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.514
Talk about fooling all the people all the time.

14:07.723 --> 14:12.478
The Archer made this statement
just after he was bailed out.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.898
<i>Thank thee compatriots of Gotham City.</i>

14:16.106 --> 14:18.317
<i>Thank thee for thy faith.</i>

14:18.525 --> 14:24.198
<i>Let it be now known to one and all,
I have foresworn my deeds of the past.</i>

14:24.406 --> 14:29.328
<i>Rich people of Gotham City,
thee may quake no more in thy boots.</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:33.665
<i>Yea and verily, I shall no longer rob thee.</i>

14:36.585 --> 14:41.090
I've programmed the Batfile of addresses
to look up any variation of the word "Archer."

14:41.298 --> 14:46.011
Ofttimes a criminal will be listed
under a nom de crime similar to his own.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.181
Nope. All of those are legitimate people.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.976
What was it that Allan A. Dale said
about Archer?

14:53.185 --> 14:54.978
The people think
he may be another Robin Hood.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.564
Ah. And what was Robin Hood's real name?

14:57.773 --> 14:59.566
I've read about that in English class.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.820
He was also known
as the, uh, outlawed earl of Huntington.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.280
Mm. Let's see what the Batfile
has to say about that.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.492
Look. There it is.

15:09.034 --> 15:12.246
An archery range owned by Earl Huntington.

15:12.454 --> 15:17.709
And Sherwood Avenue is in the Green Forest
section of Gotham City.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.629
This might be what we're looking for, Robin.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.924
I hope so. We've got to expose him
before he does even more damage.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.300
- Right.
-But how?

15:25.509 --> 15:26.885
How what, Master Robin?

15:27.094 --> 15:30.681
The Archer has sworn never again
to rob from the rich and give to the poor.

15:30.889 --> 15:35.477
But he had nothing to say
about robbing the poor to make himself rich.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.563
You think that may be his overall plan?

15:37.771 --> 15:42.776
And I wouldn't be surprised if it ultimately
involved the Wayne Foundation grant.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.445
Heaven forfend.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.489
Alfred, in your youth, you were familiar...

15:47.698 --> 15:50.909
...with the long-, the short- and the crossbow,
were you not?

15:51.118 --> 15:54.538
Yes, indeed, sir. I was known
as the William Tell of Liverpool.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.208
And you've been prepared to join us
in our crime-fighting, have you not?

15:58.417 --> 16:03.338
To serve you in any capacity, sir,
has always been my duty and my pleasure.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.801
Excellent. While Robin and I
are finding Archer's hideout...

16:08.010 --> 16:11.013
...here's all you need to do.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.355
Ah.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.945
I, uh, should like to purchase
a few shillings worth of arrows.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.617
Doth thou, uh, fancy thyself a bowman?

16:31.825 --> 16:35.579
Yes. Of the highest caliber.

16:35.746 --> 16:38.165
I've yet to meet a man who's my match.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.833
You may have met him now.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.003
Spoken like a true competitor.

16:43.212 --> 16:47.591
Mayhaps thou would care
to make a small wager on the outcome?

16:48.634 --> 16:50.135
Ah.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.931
Would, uh, a pound note?

16:56.433 --> 16:59.019
Done and done.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.813
After you, sir.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.275
Thank you.

17:10.656 --> 17:13.575
- Doth the heathen have a chance?
-Not a smidgeon.

17:13.784 --> 17:16.328
Archer will soon puncture his confidence.

17:16.537 --> 17:17.871
You know something?

17:18.079 --> 17:23.085
Youse guys ought to use American titles
under youse when youse talk.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.255
Like in the foreign pictures.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.234
Holy Inquisition.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.612
This is about the most frightening
chamber of horrors I've ever seen.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.700
Let's just hope that Alfred can keep them busy
while we take strategic positions...

17:54.908 --> 17:56.743
...and wait to trap them.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.294
Mediocre, sir.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.672
Watch some superior bowmanship.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.146
We lose more arrows that way.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.064
Let us continue.

18:26.273 --> 18:30.277
First man who misses splitting an arrow
is the loser.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.910
Hey, Archer.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.413
Somebody's fooling around
in your playroom.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.665
The signal just went on.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.543
Uh-huh. Then take the necessary measures.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.844
- We've been trapped.
- Not yet.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.596
I'll cut us free with my Bat-knife.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.016
Well, thank you so much
for a very fine afternoon's sport.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.393
But, uh, I have to be going. Heh.

19:03.602 --> 19:07.564
- Upon my soul. He doth wish to leave.
-Doth thee indeed?

19:07.773 --> 19:11.485
Yes, I do. Yes.
I have a pressing engagement elsewhere.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.446
Not by the hair of thy chinny chin chin.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.991
I believe thou were sent here
to occupy our time...

19:18.200 --> 19:21.703
...whilst someone scoured
our underground hideaway.

19:21.912 --> 19:26.416
Extraordinary idea. No, no, no.
I-- I'm merely an innocent bystander.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.627
If that be the case, fear not.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.380
Thou hath nothing to fear but thy life.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.048
Seize him.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.508
But I--

20:03.412 --> 20:07.165
I've tried every devious trick
in my quiver of terror...

20:07.374 --> 20:11.586
...but thou still refuseth
to disclose the location of the Batcave.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.756
You'll have to kill us
before we tell you where the Batcave is.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.427
Methinkest thou speakest a stream of truth.

20:18.635 --> 20:23.265
Therefore, I will kill the innocent bystander
in thy stead.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.103
Prepare him, gentlemen.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.364
Holy hostage. Don't let them do it, Batman.

20:39.573 --> 20:42.743
We'll have to leave that decision
to the innocent bystander.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.954
I would rather lay down my life...

20:46.163 --> 20:48.707
...than impair the efficiency
of Batman and Robin.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.209
Very well then. Go to it, lads.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.632
Happy landing, old man.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.010
Thou hadst a good head on thy shoulders.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.678
Whilst it lasted.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.604
You'll pay for this, you fiends.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.606
It was all for the best, Robin.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.941
How can you say that?

21:15.275 --> 21:16.818
Look.

21:23.575 --> 21:27.037
He's all right, and you knew it all the time.

21:27.537 --> 21:32.417
It's a guillotine often used by stage magicians.
I recognized it at once.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.003
He was in no danger whatsoever.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.130
Very well then.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.799
Let the varlets down.

22:03.323 --> 22:07.202
Archer, I've been meaning to ask you...

22:07.828 --> 22:11.540
...about that machine. What is it?

22:11.748 --> 22:14.668
I purloined it from the castle
of a television producer...

22:14.876 --> 22:17.546
...who makes alleged comedy programs.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.423
It can duplicate any laugh from a giggle...

22:24.219 --> 22:25.387
...to a guffaw...

22:27.514 --> 22:31.017
...and all the chortles and chuckles
betwixt and between.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.895
But I've grown weary of this fiddledeedee.

22:34.104 --> 22:38.692
I entertain suggestions for their demise
from my worthy aides-de-camp.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.778
Enclose them in a room
full of imported California smog.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.446
They wouldn't last five minutes.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.075
I have a more engaging notion.

22:47.284 --> 22:50.745
Batman, I offer thee a sporting proposition.

22:50.954 --> 22:54.291
A fair duel on the field of honor.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.589
I accept that challenge.

23:08.763 --> 23:12.726
Maid Marilyn, start the machine forthwith.

23:19.733 --> 23:24.738
Gentlemen, 'tis time to offer them
a bellyful of our steel. Shall we?

23:24.946 --> 23:27.866
- As you wish, sire.
-Your wish is my deed.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.660
Let's smite the varlets. Ha!

23:31.305 --> 23:37.260
