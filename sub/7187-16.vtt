COME ON, FOOL!

09:58.764 --> 10:01.634
DON'T LEAVE
US HANGIN', DAWG.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.502
OK, KID, BUT AFTER THIS,

10:03.502 --> 10:06.505
YOU THINK CHANG AND
THE OLD MAN ARE HANGING OUT

10:06.505 --> 10:08.841
IN THE SEWERS RIGHT NOW,
CHATTING ABOUT THE OLD DAYS?

10:08.841 --> 10:11.477
LAO SHI, IT HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.346
WE HAVE BEEN
THROUGH MUCH TOGETHER.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.381
HEH HEH HEH.
INDEED, WE HAVE.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.483
YET, I REMEMBER
THE DAY WE MET

10:17.483 --> 10:19.352
AS IF IT WERE
YESTERDAY.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.120
WHOO! SOMEBODY
CALL HEAVEN

10:21.120 --> 10:23.489
BECAUSE THE GODS ARE
MISSING AN ANGEL.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.858
OR IS THAT JUST
MY HEART TAKING OFF?

10:25.858 --> 10:27.493
IF I COULD REARRANGE
THE ALPHABET,

10:27.493 --> 10:29.695
I WOULD PUT "U"
AND "I" TOGETHER.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.497
IF YOU WERE WORDS
ON A PAGE,

10:31.497 --> 10:33.499
THEY'D CALL YOU FINE PRINT.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.134
WHOA, FU! CHANG AND GRAMPS?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.236

IN EACH OTHER'S GRILLS?

10:37.236 --> 10:39.505
BLECH! THE WHOLE THING
MADE ME SICK

10:39.505 --> 10:40.606
JUST LISTENING TO IT.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.541

HEH HEH HEH!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.347
GUYS?

10:48.347 --> 10:49.348
BUT AS I REMEMBER,

10:49.348 --> 10:51.317
OUR MEETING WAS
NOT A COINCIDENCE.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.320
THAT IS CORRECT.
I CAME SEEKING YOUR HELP.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.491
SO, DO YOU HAVE A MAP,
BECAUSE I GOT LOST IN--

10:58.491 --> 11:00.192
MY EYES.
YEAH, HEARD IT.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.661
LISTEN, THE WORLD
DRAGON COUNCILOR

11:01.661 --> 11:03.329
BELIEVES THE DARK
DRAGON HAS RETURNED.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.532
WE NEED YOU TO
LOCATE HIM BEFORE HE
DESTROYS HUMANITY.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.434
DANG, BABY CAKES.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.835
YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO KILL A MOOD.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.337
HE'S BEEN SPOTTED
HERE IN HONG KONG.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.340
BUT SO FAR,
OUR SOURCES HAVE
TURNED UP NOTHING.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.341
DON'T SWEAT IT, SUNSHINE.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.909
ME AND DRAGON MAN
ARE ON THE CASE.

11:16.909 --> 11:20.279
THIS IS GREAT SNACK MIX,
BY THE WAY.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.782
FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S KITTY LITTER.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.285
SECOND OF ALL, YOU

11:26.285 --> 11:29.455
IT'S THE LEASH I COULD DO.
HACHA!

11:29.455 --> 11:31.424
SEE POPS, A WITTY ONE-LINER.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.892

MY FUR IS.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.427
I'M A PONY.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.494
I'M A CLOWN.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.330
AND HAVE I MENTIONED
I'M HOUSE BROKEN?

11:38.330 --> 11:39.598
WELL, ALMOST HOUSE BROKEN.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.600
CLEAN UP, AISLE YOUR BED.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.603

A MORE PERFECT SIDEKICK.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.539
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, HUH?
CAN I HELP, HUH? CAN I?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.508
UNH, UNH, UNH, SORRY,

11:49.508 --> 11:52.411
NO FRIENDS, NO FAMILY,
NO SIDEKICK.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.915
THIS DRAGON DOES NOT
NEED NOBODY'S HELP.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.418
UHH.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.488
SO, AFTER
I PEELED GRAMPS OFF

12:02.488 --> 12:04.690
I AGREED TO LET FU DOG

ISN'T FOR FIGHTING,

12:27.379 --> 12:28.514
IT'S FOR GROOVING.

BUT BEFORE I COULD HELP,
SOMEONE AMBUSHED ME FROM BEHIND.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.944
I WENT DOWN LIKE
A SACK OF POTATOES

15:11.944 --> 15:14.146
