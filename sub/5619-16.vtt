00:02.379 --> 00:04.714
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.090 --> 00:07.050
Malick is supposed to be
the last head of HYDRA,

00:07.133 --> 00:08.468
but I can't shake this feeling

00:08.593 --> 00:10.470
that he's reporting to someone else.

00:10.595 --> 00:11.638
Was that Ward?

00:11.763 --> 00:13.723
Unfortunately,
I think that's something else.

00:13.807 --> 00:15.308
My ancestors

00:15.433 --> 00:18.436
were taught to believe
that if we managed to return you

00:18.561 --> 00:20.772
from that godforsaken place,
that we would be rewarded.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.734
<i>It would happen any time
Charles touched anyone.</i>

00:24.818 --> 00:28.113
<i>He and that person
would both see someone's death.</i>

00:28.738 --> 00:29.823
You're the head of my security,

00:29.948 --> 00:31.282
and you should be by my side
at all times.

00:31.408 --> 00:32.409
No.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.910
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.286
Is he all right?

00:35.620 --> 00:36.871
<i>He sounded...</i>

00:36.955 --> 00:38.248
<i>Afraid.</i>

00:57.767 --> 01:00.270
Gideon, your father was a true believer.

01:00.353 --> 01:01.855
He'll be sorely missed.

01:03.857 --> 01:06.693
Nathaniel and I will do everything
we can to continue our father's work.

01:07.444 --> 01:09.195
I'd expect nothing less
from the Malick boys.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.996
- Gideon, they're saying it's time.
- I already told them no, Nate.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.914
- We have to go see him.
- Like hell we do.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.750
We can't just ignore Daniel Whitehall.

01:21.833 --> 01:23.668
He's an old man in a prison cell.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.545
Who is still very powerful.

01:25.879 --> 01:26.921
And if he wants us to show...

01:27.005 --> 01:28.548
I don't give a damn what he wants.

01:28.882 --> 01:30.091
Dad never believed
in Whitehall's HYDRA,

01:30.175 --> 01:32.552
and we're not gonna start now.

01:32.677 --> 01:33.887
We're staying right here.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.641
They're not asking, Gideon.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.872
Sir, we're home.

02:13.551 --> 02:14.594
Hi.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.305
You've been holding out on me.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.765
We need to talk.

02:19.182 --> 02:22.227
You didn't tell me he was a looker.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.896
I don't know what I expected,

02:25.021 --> 02:29.025
but tall and handsome
were certainly not at the top of the list.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.985
Wait. Who are you talking about?

02:31.069 --> 02:32.862
Our guest.

02:32.946 --> 02:34.906
Are you saying that he's here?

02:35.573 --> 02:36.741
Why?

02:36.866 --> 02:37.992
I thought you'd be happy.

02:38.076 --> 02:39.661
Just answer the question.

02:39.744 --> 02:42.413
He showed up earlier
and asked me to gather the inner circle.

02:42.539 --> 02:44.082
They're on their way now.

02:44.249 --> 02:46.417
So, they're coming here today.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.545
Gideon.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.340
So glad you could join us.

02:52.423 --> 02:55.677
I'm honoured
that you would visit our home.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.095
To what do we owe this pleasure?

02:57.595 --> 02:59.138
I felt it was time.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.266
Time for what?

03:01.766 --> 03:03.560
To reveal my true self.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.004
- You said you killed him.
- I did.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.798
Well, you didn't kill him hard enough.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.592
Want to tell me what we're looking at?

03:35.675 --> 03:38.136
The lab is working on that question.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.346
I'm sorry about Andrew.

03:41.139 --> 03:42.557
- If you need any...
- I don't want to talk about that

03:42.640 --> 03:44.434
any more than
you want to talk about this.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.939
You don't have a lot of kills like that
under your belt.

03:50.023 --> 03:51.274
I've done my fair share.

03:51.357 --> 03:52.525
Not that you enjoyed.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.822
I would've made the same choice.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.782
We do what we have to do.

03:59.866 --> 04:01.701
I know the company line.

04:01.826 --> 04:05.330
Just feel like we're only fixing problems
that we created.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.623
Yeah.

04:07.332 --> 04:10.543
Plus side,
maybe I'll get a chance to kill him, too.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.306
You got to be kidding me.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.683
Ward?

04:25.808 --> 04:27.185
What a pain in the ass.

04:27.977 --> 04:29.562
What, leaving him for dead
on another planet

04:29.687 --> 04:31.022
isn't enough to get rid of that guy?

04:32.065 --> 04:33.316
You're looking better.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.567
Yeah?

04:35.902 --> 04:37.195
'Cause you're not.

04:38.738 --> 04:40.531
Well, we don't think
he's the guy any more.

04:40.657 --> 04:44.077
We think Ward's body was possessed,
for lack of a better word, by It,

04:44.202 --> 04:45.244
the creature.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.829
From the other planet.

04:46.913 --> 04:49.958
- And he burned them or something?
- Honestly, right now...

04:50.041 --> 04:51.250
We have no idea.

04:52.669 --> 04:55.046
When I was there,
It knew everything that Will did,

04:55.171 --> 04:56.506
even after he was gone.

04:56.589 --> 04:59.342
Which means whatever this thing is
has Ward's memories,

04:59.425 --> 05:01.094
so why hasn't It come after us?

05:01.219 --> 05:02.470
Maybe It's not interested in us.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.846
Can't believe I'm hearing this.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.766
Well, we know It destroyed
an entire civilisation over there.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.560
Who knows what It has planned here?

05:12.063 --> 05:13.898
Tremors, you saw the future, right?

05:14.899 --> 05:16.943
You see anything else?
Anything that might help us out?

05:18.027 --> 05:20.530
Director Coulson would like
to see you in his office,

05:20.613 --> 05:22.073
all of you.

05:27.578 --> 05:30.373
Malick has given new meaning
to the term "hostile takeover."

05:30.456 --> 05:33.209
What he did at Transia Corp.
was brutal, even for him.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.794
They must have something he needs.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.713
If we can figure out what it is...

05:36.796 --> 05:37.839
It'll lead us to Ward.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.215
This is not Ward.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.717
Sure is creepy like Ward.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.094
Ward's dead. I saw it happen.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.515
There's a lot of overlap
between the two companies,

05:47.598 --> 05:51.894
but only Transia has a subsidiary
dabbling in the agrochemical field.

05:51.978 --> 05:53.271
GT Agrochemical.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.480
Does what?

05:54.605 --> 05:57.150
GMOs, pesticides,
ruining the global food supply.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.818
Minutes after the takeover,

05:58.943 --> 06:01.279
a paramilitary force
took control of that branch,

06:01.404 --> 06:02.780
started moving equipment out.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.741
Zephyr is wheels up in 20.

06:04.824 --> 06:06.576
The Quinjet will peel off mid-flight.

06:06.659 --> 06:07.702
We're splitting up?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.787
Lincoln and Daisy have
a stop to make in the Badlands.

06:12.123 --> 06:15.168
There, uh... There was this
Inhuman in Afterlife.

06:15.293 --> 06:18.212
He might have answers about
whatever is possessing Ward.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.089
It's a long story.
I'll explain on the way.

06:20.590 --> 06:21.716
We're in the dark,

06:21.799 --> 06:24.177
but right now, Ward and this thing,

06:24.302 --> 06:27.430
they're not afraid to take what they want
or kill who they want.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.973
So, what's our advantage?

06:29.849 --> 06:31.642
They're not afraid.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.483
Dad, what's going on?

06:40.276 --> 06:41.986
I've seen something.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.572
There was an Inhuman,

06:44.655 --> 06:47.992
and when I touched him,
I saw a vision of the future.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.955
Really? What did you see?

06:55.666 --> 06:57.001
My death.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.714
<i>I felt so much pain.</i>

07:01.839 --> 07:04.342
<i>I was torn apart from the inside.</i>

07:06.469 --> 07:08.805
You have to tell our guest.
He can help save you.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.473
No, honey, no.

07:12.517 --> 07:15.812
I felt every cell in my body
was being destroyed.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.315
My killer...

07:20.858 --> 07:22.235
It was him.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.288
Why are we here?

07:34.372 --> 07:36.707
Our dad's body is barely cold.

07:36.833 --> 07:40.711
I felt it was vital we spoke
before your upcoming stone ceremony.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.714
Your first, yes?

07:43.840 --> 07:45.258
There'd better be a point to this.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.763
You boys are of age now.

07:51.931 --> 07:55.852
It's time you choose
a path forward in HYDRA.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.689
And with your father gone,
I believe you should choose mine.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.649
And why would we do that, old man?

08:01.732 --> 08:02.859
Gideon, don't.

08:02.942 --> 08:05.236
I'm a man of science, not religion.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.990
Your family's ancient traditions
are nonsense.

08:09.073 --> 08:11.284
You don't know anything about us
or our beliefs.

08:11.409 --> 08:15.538
No? A ceremony where grown men
draw stones from a bag

08:15.621 --> 08:17.957
and one unlucky participant
draws a white stone

08:18.082 --> 08:20.293
and is sacrificed to a liquid rock?

08:20.418 --> 08:23.337
To be chosen as the Traveler
is a great honour.

08:23.421 --> 08:24.964
An archaic blood sacrifice...

08:25.089 --> 08:28.134
You're a coward.
He was 10 times the man you are.

08:28.259 --> 08:31.762
Make no mistake.
Your rituals are foolish.

08:33.264 --> 08:36.767
But your father, he was no fool.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.436
Answer me this.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.105
How do you suppose he survived
all those ceremonies?

08:43.982 --> 08:48.279
From what I heard, he was quite
gifted with a certain parlour trick.

08:50.573 --> 08:53.743
Why leave to fate
what you could decide for yourself?

08:53.826 --> 08:55.995
Nice try. We're done here.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.956
There's a book in your father's study,

08:59.081 --> 09:02.418
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. Take a look.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.629
I believe
you'll find it most illuminating.

09:05.004 --> 09:06.339
Let's go.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.176
Nathaniel, let's go.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.766
<i>Dad.
Dad, are you listening to me?</i>

09:18.643 --> 09:20.019
He's not going to hurt you.

09:21.771 --> 09:23.147
I felt it.

09:24.023 --> 09:26.025
I think he's gonna do it tonight
in front of the others.

09:26.192 --> 09:27.860
You brought him back.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.030
You, more than anyone, are the reason
why he's even here at all.

09:31.155 --> 09:35.034
Look, I know,
and I'm as shocked as you are.

09:35.493 --> 09:38.037
But he sent Giyera away,

09:38.162 --> 09:42.625
and now he's gathering
the inner circle behind my back.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.169
He must have a good reason.

09:45.336 --> 09:48.172
Oh, he thinks he no longer needs me.

09:48.631 --> 09:52.677
And it makes sense for him to kill me
as a show of power to the others.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.513
Dad, you've always been
a faithful follower.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.640
Why would he ever hurt you?

09:59.183 --> 10:01.686
When Mom died,
I wouldn't get out of bed for a week.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.937
Remember?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.480
And you told me to man up.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.857
Stephanie...

10:06.941 --> 10:08.359
Malicks don't wait around.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.320
They roll up their sleeves,
and they get the job done.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.703
Whatever this is, you can fix it.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.832
You remind him how important you are.

10:28.379 --> 10:31.465
I'll have a Scotch waiting
when you're done.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.066
Daisy.

10:51.736 --> 10:53.571
Where'd you go?

10:53.696 --> 10:56.157
I'm trying to understand how we've been
searching the globe for months

10:56.240 --> 10:59.160
and you never bothered to mention
another Afterlife Inhuman.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.580
Potential Inhuman.
He was never given powers.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.583
And until we saw Ward's corpse
walking around,

11:05.666 --> 11:08.210
I was pretty sure he was crazytown.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.089
I wasn't trying
to keep anything from you.

11:12.757 --> 11:14.425
So don't.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.509
He's in South Dakota?

11:15.593 --> 11:16.844
Off the grid.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.680
His name's James.
He's a demolitions expert.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.766
Australian. Former mercenary.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.351
Few weeks after I got there,

11:23.434 --> 11:26.771
Jiaying caught him breaking into
her private archives and banished him.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.272
What was he doing in there?

11:28.356 --> 11:30.191
Stealing, mostly.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.527
He made a big scene,
ranting about the second coming

11:33.611 --> 11:37.198
of some ancient Inhuman
who could raise the dead.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.370
Well, something tells me he won't be
jumping at the chance to help us.

11:42.453 --> 11:46.040
He was pretty bitter, not getting powers.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.376
We'll need to be careful
and keep our eyes open.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.133
You're saying
these organisms ate these people?

11:56.217 --> 11:57.718
Well, most of them.

11:57.802 --> 12:00.304
In a remarkably short space of time.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.890
Will believed that one of
the other astronauts was burned alive.

12:03.391 --> 12:04.558
Maybe it was actually this.

12:04.642 --> 12:07.144
There was a graveyard of bones
on that planet, right?

12:08.062 --> 12:10.147
And It controls these organisms?

12:10.231 --> 12:12.817
That's one theory.
We do know that they eat living flesh.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.277
What if It also uses them
to reanimate dead flesh?

12:17.446 --> 12:18.656
Sorry.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.075
It's just...

12:21.158 --> 12:24.954
I still can't believe
this thing is here on Earth.

12:27.123 --> 12:29.750
Sir, we're nearing the agrochem facility,

12:29.834 --> 12:31.669
and you were right to head there first.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.003
Some of the boxes weren't carried out.

12:33.129 --> 12:34.463
They floated.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.966
Giyera.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.520
I always loved this place.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.274
My brother and I
used to play here as kids.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.651
Gideon, your daughter impresses me.

12:56.277 --> 12:57.987
She's a true believer.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.700
Well, I tried to raise her right,

13:02.825 --> 13:04.869
same as my dad raised me.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.621
She'll play a key role in this.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.458
Well, I'm happy to hear it.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.959
How fortunate it was for all of us

13:12.042 --> 13:14.837
that I was able to find you
and bring you home.

13:21.719 --> 13:23.220
Trivial thing, daylight,

13:24.346 --> 13:27.016
till you spend
a few centuries in the dark.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.146
How much do you remember
of those years,

13:32.229 --> 13:33.898
of your many hosts?

13:38.903 --> 13:40.738
Do their memories live on in you?

13:40.821 --> 13:43.657
Why? Is there something
you'd like to ask them?

13:51.749 --> 13:53.417
It'll all be made clear tonight.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.014
Giyera is Malick's
right hand. He's a trained killer.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.599
And torturer, don't forget.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.684
Which is why we need to make sure
he doesn't get away.

14:10.768 --> 14:13.270
It won't be easy. He can control
anything in his line of sight.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.522
Non-biological objects.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.858
Yes, non-biological objects and the like,
but he can't make you hurt yourself.

14:17.942 --> 14:20.528
Though he did turn poor
Mr Banks' gun on him.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.782
So I built handprint locks into the grips.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.451
The firing pin won't engage

14:27.576 --> 14:29.119
without the designated hand
on the trigger.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.288
Great.

14:31.372 --> 14:34.542
So, instead of shooting us,
he'll just bludgeon us to death.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.711
Before the ATCU,
Giyera spent years in Special Ops.

14:37.795 --> 14:38.879
He's dangerous without powers.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.631
Here.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.383
Tell me about this room.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.483
I hope you know how to deal
with this guy, because I'm thinking,

14:59.567 --> 15:01.902
"crazytown" was a pretty
spot-on assessment.

15:01.986 --> 15:06.073
We'll be okay,
but we shouldn't use our powers.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.658
He's cranky enough as it is.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.494
<i>Lincoln, you SOB.</i>

15:10.619 --> 15:13.747
<i>Take your little boy-band hipster scruff
and piss off.</i>

15:13.831 --> 15:15.416
What a sweetheart.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.335
Same as he ever was. Come on.

15:27.011 --> 15:28.262
Fair warning, pretty boy.

15:29.013 --> 15:32.266
You take one more step,
you're gonna regret it.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.852
James, we only want to talk.

15:38.522 --> 15:39.690
What is that?

15:43.027 --> 15:44.111
Don't move.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.323
You're standing on a land mine.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.450
I did say "one more step."

15:54.204 --> 15:55.205
Seriously?

15:55.706 --> 15:58.626
What kind of lunatic puts
land mines in their front yard?

15:58.709 --> 16:01.128
James! We're not here to fight.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.380
Oh, that's rich, coming from you.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.133
I've been waiting a long time
for this day,

16:06.550 --> 16:08.802
for Jiaying to send out
one of her little lapdogs

16:08.886 --> 16:09.970
to come after me.

16:10.638 --> 16:11.722
To be honest, I thought it'd be that

16:11.805 --> 16:14.892
no-eyed bootlicker, Gordon.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.061
Kind of shocked
that she trusted you

16:17.144 --> 16:18.687
with anything, really.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.815
Wow. You really
undersold Mr Personality.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.653
Can you hold it down?

16:25.736 --> 16:27.363
Or I'll blow off my leg.

16:29.073 --> 16:30.074
Okay.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.369
What are you doing?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.336
Look at you.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.713
Girl power. Nice move.

16:45.089 --> 16:46.674
Well, I hope you got the message.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.592
- Okay.
- Daisy, wait.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.432
Damn it. Damn it.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.949
I can't sleep, either.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.286
I'm trying not to be nervous
about the ceremony tomorrow, but...

17:17.788 --> 17:18.914
I had to know.

17:19.748 --> 17:20.915
What are you talking about?

17:22.960 --> 17:24.461
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

17:25.921 --> 17:27.131
Whitehall was right.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.384
Whitehall's a blowhard.
He was trying to mess with us.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.974
Dad,

17:37.641 --> 17:39.727
he would swap in this stone
during the ceremonies

17:40.269 --> 17:41.812
and feel for the notch

17:42.479 --> 17:43.981
to make sure he never drew it
from the bag.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.315
He would never do that.

17:45.441 --> 17:48.819
But he did. It's all right here, Gideon.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.990
Dad was afraid to be the Traveler.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.411
He was a coward

17:58.412 --> 18:00.080
and a cheater.

18:00.164 --> 18:02.332
Everything he said to us was a lie.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.602
Maybe Dad wasn't
who we thought he was,

18:21.685 --> 18:26.190
but our family has upheld
this faith for centuries.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.941
And that is not gonna end with us.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.777
We'll be better men.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.695
How?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.829
We do the ceremony the right way
and let fate decide.

18:41.497 --> 18:43.165
Together to the end.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.962
Together to the end.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.975
Dad, you okay?

19:04.353 --> 19:05.562
The others are anxious to know
why they're here,

19:05.687 --> 19:08.315
and I don't know if I can
keep the secret much longer.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.568
Once we begin, there's no turning back.
Whatever happens.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.572
If you were me,
I know exactly what you'd say right now.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.244
"It's time to man up."

19:24.998 --> 19:26.917
My friends, it's time to begin.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.424
I know you're wondering
why we're here.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.513
It's been a long time, but today,

19:39.596 --> 19:43.058
we're not here for a ceremony,
but a celebration.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.188
We've devoted our lives

19:48.272 --> 19:50.357
to bringing the HYDRA god
back from exile,

19:50.440 --> 19:52.192
and I know some in this room

19:52.276 --> 19:53.694
have doubted that he'd ever return.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.696
You doubted me. Well...

19:55.779 --> 19:57.447
They were wrong.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.451
My exile's over.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.584
What is this?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.044
You're Grant Ward.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.297
Yes, I am.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.465
But this body is only a vessel,

20:15.591 --> 20:18.468
one of many who gave their life
so that I could survive.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.054
As promised, all of the Travelers,

20:21.138 --> 20:24.308
the brave men who sacrificed for me,

20:24.391 --> 20:25.642
have finally returned.

20:26.643 --> 20:27.936
Thanks to the Malick family.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.815
You'll all get what you deserve.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.320
And for those of you still having doubts,

20:39.281 --> 20:40.657
see and believe.

21:00.636 --> 21:01.803
<i>The area's clear, Director.</i>

21:02.179 --> 21:03.430
<i>Scanning the building for Giyera.</i>

21:03.513 --> 21:05.432
Most of the lab equipment's
been taken away.

21:05.515 --> 21:06.600
Files, too.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.685
What hasn't been taken away
has been destroyed.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.648
Nope.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.192
Nothing sinister about that.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.326
No quick moves, tough guy.

21:24.868 --> 21:25.869
Hand it over,

21:25.994 --> 21:27.704
unless you want to wrestle for it.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.040
I can see you're not afraid
of a little scrape.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.543
We only need information
about that ancient Inhuman

21:33.627 --> 21:35.128
you used to talk about,

21:35.212 --> 21:37.214
and anything you stole before
being thrown out of...

21:37.297 --> 21:38.382
I'm sorry.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.969
I just can't get over the irony
of this whole situation.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.971
Jiaying elected to give you powers?

21:44.054 --> 21:45.389
Oh, Lincoln.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.556
Man, you're a mess.

21:46.682 --> 21:47.808
You don't know what you're talking...

21:47.891 --> 21:49.643
Makes me wonder
what you've been giving her.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.145
Something a little extra
on the side after hours?

21:52.229 --> 21:55.482
What? Well, the woman's crazy,
but she's not bad for a senior citizen.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.734
We're not here on her behalf.

21:57.818 --> 21:58.986
We're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.487
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.739
Even I know the band broke up, brother.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.826
Why don't you leave me out
of whatever little plan you and Jiaying...

22:05.909 --> 22:08.745
Jiaying's dead,
and Afterlife is a pile of ashes.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.998
Well, hallelujah.

22:11.081 --> 22:12.749
You see? We're on the same side.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.334
So why don't you tell us
what you found?

22:14.418 --> 22:16.169
Why?

22:16.253 --> 22:18.422
I don't really do things out of
the kindness of my own heart.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.382
Haven't really understood
that behaviour, to be honest.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.926
Yeah, that's why I brought
a little incentive.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.182
I know all you've ever wanted
is to be like us,

22:29.266 --> 22:31.226
so I thought I'd put
that offer on the table.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.607
You should've opened with that.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.528
Looks like the data was uploaded
off-site before it was wiped.

22:41.611 --> 22:44.114
Work with Fitz.
See if you can trace where it was sent.

22:44.573 --> 22:48.201
And gather what's left
of these experiments for Simmons.

22:48.285 --> 22:52.456
Maybe she can figure out what the hell
they were working on here.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.459
<i>Sir, Giyera's coming your way.</i>

22:56.460 --> 22:57.544
Copy that.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.576
Not so fun when we
take away your toys, is it?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.974
So we're doing this the hard way?

24:26.883 --> 24:28.969
I don't usually like
getting my hands dirty,

24:29.636 --> 24:31.847
but for you, I'll make an exception.

24:32.556 --> 24:33.890
Don't bother.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.492
Giyera uploaded this data to
a set of servers in Schoonebeek.

24:52.576 --> 24:54.828
It's on the Dutch-German border.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.163
It's an abandoned oil field.

24:56.246 --> 24:58.415
So, HYDRA's in the oil business now?

24:58.540 --> 25:01.501
It's like they're not even trying
to avoid the bad-guy clichés.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.170
Get the coordinates to the cockpit.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.760
Damn it.

25:10.886 --> 25:12.637
Get out of there right now.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.306
Go, go, go, go!

25:19.186 --> 25:20.312
We'll get him to talk.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.479
Maybe.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.442
If not, let's hope Daisy and Lincoln
come back with something useful.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.320
<i>Most of what I stole was junk.</i>

25:28.820 --> 25:30.572
But this was interesting.

25:36.494 --> 25:41.416
I give you the alien thingamajig
and you give me the crystal.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.584
That's Kree.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.086
Looks like you're the muscles
and the brains, huh?

25:45.170 --> 25:46.213
He's just the haircut.

25:46.296 --> 25:47.339
What does it do?

25:47.422 --> 25:51.176
Well, if I could figure that out,
I would be doing that instead of this.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.678
But from what I can gather,
it was snatched up

25:53.762 --> 25:56.223
by this ancient that
you're badgering me about,

25:56.306 --> 25:58.350
after the Kree were killed
or driven out or whatever.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.018
When the Inhumans
revolted against them.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.270
And it was your man that led the charge.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.731
They called him Alveus.
It was Latin or something.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.650
One of the first Inhumans.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.069
Original blend. Powerful.

26:09.152 --> 26:12.948
Designed by the Kree to command the
Inhuman army for them.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.866
That idea really bit him in the ass,
didn't it?

26:15.283 --> 26:16.493
Powerful how?

26:16.576 --> 26:20.205
I'm not sure, but the archive said
that the Inhumans started to fear him,

26:20.288 --> 26:23.792
and they had to band together
with regular humans to banish him.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.336
Look, those records,
they say that all of us at Afterlife

26:26.419 --> 26:28.213
descended from
the first group of Inhumans.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.464
That was our history.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.091
She had no right to keep it from us.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.385
She was probably scared
someone would try to bring him back.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.136
Maybe.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.222
Wait. You guys aren't trying
to bring him back, are you?

26:37.305 --> 26:38.556
- Of course not.
- Never.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.766
Good.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.935
Well, this priceless artefact is yours.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.562
If you want it,
just give me the damn crystal.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.240
You lying son of a bitch.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.242
See, Jiaying was right
about some things.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.161
Not everyone deserves powers.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.871
And you do?

27:01.955 --> 27:04.165
Now that you got electricity
running through your veins,

27:04.249 --> 27:05.709
you might actually kill someone.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.088
Let's get out of here.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.717
Oh, Boyfriend of the Year didn't tell you
how his last relationship ended.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.093
He nearly murdered the poor girl.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.761
But I can see by your face

27:16.845 --> 27:18.179
that you're familiar
with that side of him.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.472
Daisy, come on.

27:20.307 --> 27:23.184
You may think you can change him,
sweetheart, but you're wrong.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.894
Men like him don't change!

27:31.067 --> 27:32.652
Let me pour you that Scotch.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.157
Neat, two fingers?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.081
To you,

27:45.165 --> 27:47.751
for reminding me
what it means to be a Malick.

27:48.293 --> 27:50.045
I learned from the best.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.764
What do you got there?

28:02.265 --> 28:04.351
Our guest seems to have
taken a liking to me.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.020
Got me a gift.

28:08.021 --> 28:09.439
A token of appreciation.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.859
For standing by his side.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.153
I told him it was my pleasure, but...

28:15.236 --> 28:16.488
It's very thoughtful.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.327
I know that look.

28:24.621 --> 28:27.665
It's been a long day. I may turn in.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.251
You're not still questioning him.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.962
No. Not any more.

28:35.924 --> 28:37.050
Good night, Dad.

28:38.385 --> 28:39.719
Love you.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.264
I love you, too.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.603
See you in the morning.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.199
The <i>Sturnus vulgaris,</i>
or European starling,

29:01.282 --> 29:03.451
one of America's scariest
invasive species.

29:04.202 --> 29:05.245
They're just birds.

29:05.328 --> 29:06.871
Birds can be scary.

29:06.955 --> 29:09.124
Imagine a flock of a million
coming to peck your eyes out

29:09.207 --> 29:10.834
with their tiny little beaks.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.752
So they were studying birds and bugs?

29:12.836 --> 29:14.879
And all sorts of other invasive species.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.674
Yeah, they were genetically engineering
plants and animals to resist them.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.467
This was their most
cutting-edge division.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.636
Why would It burn the evidence, then?

29:21.719 --> 29:25.390
Well, either he wanted to use it
and was covering his tracks,

29:25.473 --> 29:27.308
or he was afraid of it.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.270
Keep looking.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.147
Maybe we find a chink in his armour.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.982
How close are you
to figuring out what he is?

29:34.399 --> 29:35.817
Well, I have a theory, at least.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.193
These experiments have me thinking,

29:37.277 --> 29:40.321
the organisms we found on the bones,
I don't think he's controlling them.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.910
I think he is them.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.538
He's a parasite.

29:49.581 --> 29:52.417
A parasite that retains the memories
of the body he took over.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.836
Sounds even worse
when you say it like that.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.603
Is there something wrong, sir?

30:20.445 --> 30:21.905
You were there.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.199
You saw.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.911
"We do what we have to do."

30:29.746 --> 30:31.456
That's your words.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.832
Yeah.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.459
And that's what I've been telling myself.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.169
And now you don't believe that
that's true?

30:37.504 --> 30:39.130
It was true for you.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.425
You were left no choice on that planet.

30:42.509 --> 30:45.428
You did the right thing,
but I crossed a line.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.431
Ward deserved to be punished,
but no one deserves to have the life...

30:48.515 --> 30:49.641
No, he did deserve it.

30:49.724 --> 30:52.227
He did deserve to have
his chest caved in, no question.

30:52.310 --> 30:56.231
That's not the point. It was payback.
That's not what we do here.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.233
Well, what was the alternative?

30:59.150 --> 31:00.818
I mean, letting him live, letting him win?

31:00.902 --> 31:02.237
Don't you see?

31:06.491 --> 31:08.243
When I killed him, he did.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.497
I knew it would come back to haunt me,

31:12.580 --> 31:16.543
I just didn't think It would
actually come back to haunt me.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.754
You're gonna tell us
everything you know,

31:19.837 --> 31:22.215
about Malick, about your plans,

31:22.298 --> 31:24.175
about that thing you brought back
through the portal.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.052
I should thank you.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.888
Without S.H.I.E.L.D.,
he never would've made it home.

31:28.972 --> 31:32.976
Wow. You're really
drinking the Kool-Aid, aren't you?

31:33.059 --> 31:35.019
This leader of yours
must be a real charmer.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.271
We don't have leaders.

31:36.354 --> 31:37.522
We're working towards a common goal.

31:37.605 --> 31:41.192
That's what they tell you when you
join a cult, but it's actually not true.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.486
Eventually, you'll get it.

31:43.570 --> 31:46.239
We see such great potential
for humanity.

31:46.698 --> 31:50.868
Those who are worthy
will inherit a better world.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.579
And those who aren't?

31:55.915 --> 31:57.959
We're nearing Dutch airspace.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.337
Looks like we're gonna find out
what you and Malick are hiding

32:01.421 --> 32:03.256
whether you help us or not.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.435
So, you kept it.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.980
After all these years.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.238
Stephanie, give us a moment.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.240
Dad, what is going on?

32:29.324 --> 32:30.700
There's no reason for her to see this.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.909
I invited her here.

32:32.535 --> 32:35.204
She deserves to know the truth
about her father.

32:35.288 --> 32:38.416
<i>You've had this notched stone
since that day at the pond.</i>

32:43.296 --> 32:44.589
Together to the end.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.385
<i>You knew you'd never be chosen.</i>

32:54.891 --> 32:56.017
<i>Tell me, Gideon,</i>

32:56.434 --> 33:00.438
was this a deliberate betrayal,
or was it all just to save your own life?

33:01.522 --> 33:03.274
I loved Nathaniel.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.778
So, it was just fate
that it came down to the two of us.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.087
Dad, what is he saying?

33:24.587 --> 33:29.217
Your father is not the brave man
he claims to be.

33:38.643 --> 33:40.436
I thought we had a deal.

33:43.773 --> 33:45.066
I thought...

33:45.149 --> 33:46.275
Let's go.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.994
I thought we had a deal.

33:59.497 --> 34:00.665
Nate?

34:00.748 --> 34:03.084
What happened to
"together to the end," brother?

34:03.584 --> 34:05.420
Oh, I meant every word of that.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.841
I wanted you by my side,
but I didn't have a choice.

34:09.924 --> 34:12.092
Is that what
you've been telling yourself?

34:12.176 --> 34:13.678
I never gave up on you, Nate.

34:13.761 --> 34:15.138
I carried on the tradition.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.389
I gave up everything
so that you could return.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.766
You were never willing
to give up everything.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.643
So, all these years,

34:23.062 --> 34:25.773
you just lied to my face?

34:26.940 --> 34:28.275
He was selfish.

34:29.694 --> 34:31.612
He gets it from our father.

34:37.201 --> 34:39.746
They were both too afraid
to make a true sacrifice.

34:39.829 --> 34:42.415
Yeah, I'll die if I have to,
but not as a coward.

34:42.498 --> 34:47.253
Stephanie, I won't let you remember me
the way I remember my father.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.759
Do what you have to.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.552
This needs to be made right.

34:56.888 --> 34:59.056
But I still need a Malick by my side.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.878
Now you understand sacrifice.

35:35.593 --> 35:37.220
He said you almost
killed your girlfriend.

35:37.303 --> 35:41.015
What the hell was he talking about?
Who was she?

35:41.098 --> 35:43.100
Why haven't you said
anything about this before?

35:43.184 --> 35:45.228
Because I never wanted you
to see that side of me.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.814
I don't really care
what you want right now, Lincoln.

35:47.897 --> 35:50.066
You can't just show me
Mr Perfect all the time

35:50.149 --> 35:51.359
and keep all the ugly parts hidden away.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.361
That's not how this works.

35:53.444 --> 35:56.364
I need the truth,
or whatever we are ends now.

36:04.372 --> 36:05.790
Okay.

36:10.253 --> 36:13.714
You know
how we've talked about

36:13.798 --> 36:16.092
how most Inhumans have this feeling

36:16.175 --> 36:20.513
where nothing feels right, just empty?

36:21.013 --> 36:24.141
Yeah, like how I spent my entire life
searching for my parents.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.310
It's a classic attempt to fill the void.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.146
Well, I tried to fill it with vodka,

36:30.273 --> 36:32.066
but I couldn't control it,

36:32.608 --> 36:35.236
the drinking or my temper.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.780
You've told me this.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.658
Not this.

36:41.742 --> 36:45.204
My girlfriend thought she could help me
to be a better person.

36:46.956 --> 36:48.541
We fought about that a lot.

36:50.293 --> 36:54.338
I don't even remember
what we were arguing about that night,

36:54.422 --> 36:57.758
but the more I drank, the angrier I got.

36:57.842 --> 37:00.469
I just wanted to get away,

37:00.553 --> 37:02.722
so I got in the car.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.599
I don't know
why the hell she got in with me,

37:04.682 --> 37:07.018
trying to talk me down.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.856
We ended up
wrapped around a telephone pole.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.941
Oh, my God.

37:14.025 --> 37:16.652
She was basically dead.

37:17.695 --> 37:19.530
But then Gordon showed up,

37:20.656 --> 37:22.617
said he'd been watching me.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.995
They saved her and me.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.664
Brought me to Afterlife.

37:28.748 --> 37:32.585
And for the first time,
I felt like that emptiness

37:32.668 --> 37:35.046
might be filled one day.

37:49.352 --> 37:51.020
Thank you.

37:54.065 --> 37:56.233
I want you to know

37:56.317 --> 37:58.527
that I would never hurt you.

38:00.029 --> 38:01.280
I know.

38:02.949 --> 38:05.117
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner,

38:07.036 --> 38:09.080
but I don't want any more secrets.

38:09.789 --> 38:10.957
Yeah.

38:15.002 --> 38:18.547
And there's something
I have to tell you.

38:21.884 --> 38:26.389
I got another glimpse into the future.

38:27.765 --> 38:28.808
And...

38:30.142 --> 38:31.978
I don't know when,

38:33.062 --> 38:35.523
but someone on our team is gonna die.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.388
That's not good.

39:15.813 --> 39:17.857
- Giyera's escaped.
- Do not let him in here.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.723
You can't stop us.

39:57.897 --> 40:00.191
You're not getting this plane
without a fight.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.861
We don't need to fight any more.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.293
Mayday! Mayday!

40:21.378 --> 40:23.130
- What the hell?
- Thrusters at maximum!

40:29.762 --> 40:31.680
- Pull up!
- I can't!

40:46.612 --> 40:47.905
Simmons?

40:54.453 --> 40:56.247
Daisy, come in.

40:57.123 --> 40:59.041
Giyera's taken control of the plane.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.918
We need...

41:01.710 --> 41:03.003
<i>May?</i>

41:03.087 --> 41:04.213
May?

41:05.464 --> 41:06.590
May?

41:07.299 --> 41:08.384
Line's dead.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.553
Everyone from our team
is on that plane.

41:13.389 --> 41:14.515
Not everyone.

41:16.851 --> 41:19.728
You put together the
Secret Warriors Initiative for a reason.

41:19.812 --> 41:21.814
No, Lincoln, what... What if...

41:21.897 --> 41:25.359
You can't be afraid of that vision.
We both know we got to do something.

41:32.116 --> 41:33.576
Let's call them in.

41:50.259 --> 41:51.594
Good news.

41:51.677 --> 41:54.805
Giyera's captured a S.H.I.E.L.D.
airship with several prisoners.

41:54.889 --> 41:56.724
We should be on our way.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.980
Sacrifice is never easy,

42:03.063 --> 42:06.150
but we have balanced the scales today.

42:07.776 --> 42:10.029
You have nothing else to fear.

42:16.410 --> 42:18.245
Together to the end.
