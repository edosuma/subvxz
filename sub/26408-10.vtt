00:01.520 --> 00:03.169
Previously onSEAL Team...I don't want to be

00:03.220 --> 00:04.471
at each other's throats forever.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.603
I want to put it
to bed, bury it.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.130
Want to bury it? Yeah, you're
pretty good at burying things.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.171
Burying people, too.

00:13.490 --> 00:14.832
Wait, wait, we need him alive!

00:14.880 --> 00:16.222
Go, go! Come on,
let's go! Go!

00:17.320 --> 00:18.537
JASON: Do whatever
you need to do to save him.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.740
We lose him, we lose Doza.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.188
We lose Doza,
we got nothing.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.310
We're back
to square one.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.019
Martinez didn't
rat us out. So who?

00:24.060 --> 00:25.709
MANDY: It wasn't Carla
who gave us up.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.886
It was you.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.014
I can't lose my family.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.492
Doza is everywhere.

00:30.550 --> 00:31.494
JASON:
Tell me where he is,

00:31.550 --> 00:32.505
you get to live.

00:32.550 --> 00:33.892
Where's Doza?! Tell me!

00:33.940 --> 00:36.022
It's a safe house
for when things go wrong.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.520
Hey.

00:52.570 --> 00:54.174
If you've come to
point out the fact

00:54.220 --> 00:56.871
that I was riding you for
not having your head in the game

00:56.920 --> 00:58.740
while I was sitting next
to a turncoat,

00:58.790 --> 01:00.746
please don't.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.221
Look”.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.659
I'm really sorry
about Rita, all right?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.711
No one saw that
betrayal coming.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.194
Led us right into an ambush.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.893
I used to think that some people
were incorruptible, but...

01:17.940 --> 01:20.329
everyone's corruptible.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.814
Everyone has
their breaking point.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.851
Not Martinez.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.908
He's a hero.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.081
I got to gear up.

01:33.130 --> 01:34.779
Jason.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.082
What I said
in the club,

01:39.140 --> 01:43.042
I wasn't just trying to tell
you what you wanted to hear.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.091
It was the truth.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.531
Yeah, I know.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.969
Are we good?

01:51.980 --> 01:53.322
Yeah, we're good.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.452
All right?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.627
Time to end this.
TIme to get Doza.

02:10.730 --> 02:15.429
Bravo 1, target building is 800
meters north of your location.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.948
Okay, we confirmed
HVT's on target?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.174
Negative. But ISR shows
fighting age males in the area.

02:21.220 --> 02:24.178
JASON: Havoc Base,
blocking force is peeling off.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.130
We're coming up on target.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.740
All that dirty drug money and
this is where Doza hangs out?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.609
Well, he knows how to lay low.

02:30.670 --> 02:33.446
Doza's a snake.
Snake's as low as you can go.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.924
Yeah. Well, let's hope
it's not another setup.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.938
Well, according to SEAL lore,

02:39.980 --> 02:43.063
a team can only be ambushed once
per deployment.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.634
That's not really a thing.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.728
Yeah, I know, but I wish it was.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.466
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Conando.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.159
Copy, Bravo 1.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.037
Office building's the last place
I thought we'd find Doza.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.342
MANDY:
He's smart.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.904
Anything ostentatious
would draw attention.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.396
The team is moving
into position.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.262
Bravo 1, we're standing by.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.090
Havoc, this is 1.
Passing Aricebo.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.665
ERIC:
That's good copy, 1.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.719
Set.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.716
All elements,
execute, execute, execute.

04:09.770 --> 04:10.930
Burn in!

04:17.990 --> 04:20.857
Bravo 1 clearing third floor.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.305
Bravo 6 clearing basement.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.100
JASON:
Bravo 1 clearing second floor.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.329
Hey! Manos arriba!
Manos arriba!

05:38.380 --> 05:40.632
Dame sus manos.
Dame sus manos.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.148
Hey. Zip-zip tie
her. Zip tie her.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.814
SONNY: Clear! Dime, dnde est Doza?

05:44.860 --> 05:46.293
Eagle, Eagle, Eagle!

05:46.340 --> 05:48.296
D That's all the rooms.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.035
Dgame dnde est Doza ahorita.What's going on?

05:50.080 --> 05:52.162
What's she saying?She's not--
she's not saying anything.

05:52.220 --> 05:54.381
She says she doesn't know.
Dgame, dnde est Doza?

05:54.440 --> 05:55.998
What's going on?You understand. She's-she's
saying she doesn't understand.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.119
She doesn't know.Ask her again.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.829
Dnde est Doza?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.177
Ask her again! Dnde est Doza?

06:00.220 --> 06:01.528
Dgame ahorita
dnde est!

06:01.570 --> 06:04.038
Si t sabes, dnde est?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.235
Wall charge.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.229
Havoc, this is 1.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.659
Passing San Juan.
Target's not here.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.666
Found Doza's safe room.
It's a dry hole.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.143
That's good copy, 1.

06:54.190 --> 06:55.361
We know.

06:55.410 --> 06:58.106
If there's a TV there,
turn it on.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.672
I am Andres Doza,

07:06.730 --> 07:08.243
a businessman,

07:08.290 --> 07:11.418
and I am the victim _
of American criminal aggressron.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.904
I am being hunted, in Mxico,

07:13.950 --> 07:15.679
by United States soldiers.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.288
I am not a perfect man,

07:17.340 --> 07:19.649
but I am not the man
that they say I am.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.339
It is the Americans
who are the criminals,

07:22.390 --> 07:24.472
and I would rather give up
my freedom than allow them

07:24.530 --> 07:27.658
to operate in secret
on our soil.

07:27.700 --> 07:31.739
I am doing this so that
my people will know the truth.

07:31.790 --> 07:35.886
I'm doing this
for the Mexican people.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.051
You know what this is, right?

07:41.110 --> 07:42.236
Yeah, I know what this is.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.419
This is Doza's escape plan.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.202
Doza's lawyers released these
shortly after his arrest.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.204
It's creating

08:01.260 --> 08:02.739
a public uproar.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.338
Look at those angles.

08:04.390 --> 08:06.301
Doza had men there
taking pictures.

08:06.350 --> 08:08.045
American Special Forces engaging

08:08.090 --> 08:09.603
in combat on the
streets of Mexico?

08:09.660 --> 08:12.436
It's not something the CIA
or the Mexican SEDENA

08:12.490 --> 08:13.969
wants public.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.262
So say it. What does this mean?
What does this mean?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.788
It means we're done.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.149
Bravo Team has been ordered
to leave the country

08:21.190 --> 08:22.919
within 24 hours.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.619
I thought we had
a chance this time.

08:25.670 --> 08:28.321
I could see an end
to the plague of this man.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.326
I should have known
Doza would slip away.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.110
That's how it always ends.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.321
The Mexican government sent us
down here to get a job done.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.768
Yeah, well, the president,

08:35.810 --> 08:37.687
the president of this country,
has ordered us out.

08:37.730 --> 08:40.119
Okay, so what-what are we gonna
do? We just let this guy Doza

08:40.170 --> 08:42.468
run his cartel
through some farce arrest?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.124
Or, better yet,
continue to go after

08:44.170 --> 08:45.819
this guy and
his family?

08:45.870 --> 08:48.304
Oh, and-- not to mention--
let them get away with murdering

08:48.350 --> 08:50.079
an American DEA agent?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.529
Is that what you're saying,
Blackburn?

08:51.570 --> 08:52.958
No. We finish this.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.693
What do you want to do, Jason?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.229
You want to go
after Doza alone?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.828
No military assets,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.529
no recon, in his home country.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.094
He controls the police.
He controls everything here.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.960
Yeah, I do. That's what I want
to do. I want to...No, it's not happening.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.882
Look, Mexican government knows
where Doza is now, right?

09:09.940 --> 09:11.009
So why don't they
just go in there

09:11.070 --> 09:12.367
and drop the hammer on him?

09:12.420 --> 09:14.888
The Chiapas region
is a political powder keg.

09:14.940 --> 09:18.194
Capital fears intervention
with federal troops

09:18.250 --> 09:20.559
will cause civic unrest.DAVIS: Doza cut our legs out

09:20.600 --> 09:21.817
from under us knowing
that his government

09:21.860 --> 09:22.815
wouldn't come after him.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.942
MANDY: Very clever.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.550
Guys, the minute
that we leave Mexican airspace,

09:27.610 --> 09:30.511
this guy, Doza, he's just gonna
be right out of jail

09:30.570 --> 09:32.219
and he's gonna be
terrorizing this country.

09:32.260 --> 09:34.433
And Martinez died for nothing.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.606
So that's it?

09:35.660 --> 09:37.343
There's nothing left we can do?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.355
You know, there is.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.095
We got 24 hours.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.040
Meaning?Meaning, this guy Doza,

09:42.100 --> 09:44.091
he's a threat
to the Mexican government.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.314
They want him
just as bad as we do.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.578
If there's deniability,

09:49.630 --> 09:51.586
that's gonna give us
another shot to go after him.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.109
MANDY: That's not
a bad idea.

09:53.150 --> 09:54.629
If SEDENA's fingerprints
aren't on this,

09:54.680 --> 09:56.329
maybe I can persuade them.

09:56.370 --> 09:57.803
Good. Okay, listen.

09:57.850 --> 09:59.715
Feels like we've been
on three ops and had no sleep.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.670
So let's get some rest.ERIC:
Yeah, if you're hoping

10:01.730 --> 10:03.766
for a Hail Mary for the win,

10:03.820 --> 10:05.720
you've already lost.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.647
C-17's en route.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.681
Let's get to packing.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.302
Oh, wow.

10:17.390 --> 10:19.210
I thought I told everyone
to get some sleep.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.783
What are you still doing up?

10:20.830 --> 10:24.573
Yeah, you know, a little sleep
has been hard to come by.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.872
Yeah.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.444
That seems to be the thing
going around these days.

10:29.490 --> 10:31.879
No sleep, huh

10:33.320 --> 10:34.753
Hey, I, uh,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.756
I shouldn't be questioning
your judgment in the field.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.107
Forget it, man.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.289
You know what?
You're frustrated. That's all.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.104
Besides, you almost got
mudsucked, you know?

10:42.160 --> 10:43.889
And that'll do that
to people, trust me.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.419
We'll try and keep that
for the AAR next time.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.200
Not when we're, uh,
stuck in a church, you know?

10:48.250 --> 10:49.683
Bullets about to fly.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.039
Yeah, I've just,

10:52.080 --> 10:54.469
been a little on edge
recently, you know?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.909
Stella.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.736
Yeah. They told you, huh?

10:59.780 --> 11:00.917
Yeah.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.518
Sucks, man. I've been there.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.172
Eh, it's nothing

11:05.220 --> 11:06.744
compared to what you're
going through, though, man.

11:06.790 --> 11:09.258
Look, Clay, you just...

11:09.320 --> 11:10.799
Come on, man.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.703
So, look, all
we can do is...

11:15.760 --> 11:18.103
we just learn from our losses,

11:18.150 --> 11:20.323
not let them
defeat us.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.930
Alana for me, Stella for you.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.154
All we can do is be grateful
that they were in our lives.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.543
Come on, Clay. Good?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.682
Let's go.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.209
You got it.Yeah-- no.
Not hugging, buddy.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.558
Jason.Not hugging

11:33.600 --> 11:35.158
Took some arm twisting,
but SEDENA's

11:35.210 --> 11:37.166
cleared us
for one last run at Doza.

11:37.210 --> 11:39.166
We have till sunrise tomorrow.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.120
Let's hope the sun rises
on his body, shall we?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.341
Let's go. Come on.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.099
RAY: So they're still kicking us
out of the country,

11:51.140 --> 11:53.449
but the Mexican government
is gonna let us

11:53.490 --> 11:54.923
take another crack at Doza?

11:54.970 --> 11:57.359
As long as they have
plausible deniability,

11:57.410 --> 12:00.402
SEDENA's okay with us operating
until the president's deadline.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.578
But they will not support us
with assets or troops.

12:03.630 --> 12:06.281
It's a lot of risk,
a lot of unknowns.

12:06.330 --> 12:07.934
Love risks, love the unknown.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.858
We've faced tougher odds.That's for sure. Much tougher.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.197
Well, we don't
have time to recon.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.150
Don't have a Marine base
to run the op out of.

12:14.210 --> 12:15.689
CLAY: Yeah, well,
C

12:15.730 --> 12:17.459
I mean, so why don't
we just run Havoc out of that,

12:17.510 --> 12:18.772
like a million times before?

12:18.820 --> 12:20.071
MANDY:
Okay, to be clear:

12:20.130 --> 12:21.813
if you're detained,
no one is coming after you.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.599
You are on your own.JASON: Look,
we get into

12:23.650 --> 12:26.915
the mansion undetected,
I love our chances.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.861
But, again,
that's up to the team.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.433
Shooter's got to shoot.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.038
I'm in.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.136
I hear Chiapas is lovely
this time of year.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.967
ERIC: With the Mexicans
gIVIng us their blessmg

12:38.010 --> 12:41.889
and y'all chomping
at the bit, op's a go.

12:41.930 --> 12:43.704
I'm coming, too.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.978
You get caught out there...

12:46.020 --> 12:48.238
I was acting on my own.
That's what I'll say.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.807
I must finish
what Colonel Martinez started.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.239
All right.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.987
Doza's prison compound
is just off the coast,

12:58.030 --> 12:59.725
500 miles directly to our south.

12:59.770 --> 13:01.203
Great.
How we getting down there?

13:01.250 --> 13:03.036
Agency contact of mine
managed to wrangle us a helo,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.251
off the books.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.551
DAVIS: There's one road
in to the target,

13:05.610 --> 13:07.828
likely to be swarmed with guards
and checkpoints.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.384
Wouldn't be an issue if we had
a force of 60 soldiers.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.782
Don't have 60, we got seven.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.695
All right? So we got to come in
a different route.

13:13.740 --> 13:14.877
Any ideas?

13:16.090 --> 13:17.227
This mangrove?

13:17.270 --> 13:18.874
Yep.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.525
This, uh, this mangrove swamp
right here off the coast, right?

13:21.580 --> 13:23.002
I mean, this could provide some
pretty good cover

13:23.060 --> 13:24.357
to get into his compound.

13:24.410 --> 13:25.968
JASON:
A natural barrier like that

13:26.020 --> 13:28.181
will bog down most forces.RAY: Doza won't
expect anyone

13:28.240 --> 13:30.060
coming from there.
Mm-mm.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.362
So we'll chopper in

13:32.420 --> 13:34.547
offshore here,
and we'll swim to the coastline.

13:34.590 --> 13:36.410
All this land
between here and Chiapas,

13:36.460 --> 13:38.724
and yet, you find a way
to get us to swim.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.726
JASON:
Small swim. You're not gonna
be eaten by a shark, Sonny.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.079
Yeah, but the jaguars in that
mangrove, man, they could.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.678
SONNY:
What, there's j...

13:44.730 --> 13:46.288
there's jaguars?RAY:
Yeah.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.205
Jaguars are the sharks of the
jungle. You know that, right?

13:48.260 --> 13:49.557
SONNY: Oh, well, that would
make sense, 'cause they,

13:49.610 --> 13:51.214
they got them big old
teeth and stuff, right?

13:51.260 --> 13:52.864
Can we just call in
an airstrike?

13:52.910 --> 13:56.084
Negative. How far from the coast
is Doza's mansion?

13:56.130 --> 13:57.870
About a nine-klick hike,
incHned.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.171
Once you get through
the mangrove,

13:59.220 --> 14:00.744
you'll hit arid coastal desert.

14:00.790 --> 14:04.009
Mm. That's at least six hours
to get through that on foot.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.051
DAVIS: And no ISR
under that canopy,

14:06.100 --> 14:08.568
so if Doza's men are patrolling,
we have no way to warn you.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.881
Well, what about exfil?

14:09.930 --> 14:11.238
Whole region's probably
gonna be after us.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.588
We're gonna need
to get out quick.

14:12.630 --> 14:14.450
Once we hit jackpot
at the mansion,

14:14.500 --> 14:16.286
the helo will land at the,

14:16.330 --> 14:18.195
the polo fields,
and we'll be gone.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.798
Solid plan for 30 minutes.

14:19.850 --> 14:21.454
JASON: Yeah, well,
you know what?

14:21.510 --> 14:24.206
We got 18 hours till our hunting
license expires, so let's move.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.024
All right.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.813
JASON : Bravo 1
to Havoc Base, I pass Vader.

14:32.870 --> 14:36.431
ERIC:
Copy that, 1. Passing Vader.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.471
Welcome to the jungle.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.539
SONNY:
Please tell me that growl

14:51.580 --> 14:54.014
wasn't a jaguar.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.234
Want someone to hold
your hand, Sonny?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.929
What I do want to get a hold of

14:58.980 --> 15:01.619
is my rightful place
atop of the food chain.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.931
I've got six klicks to Doza.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.629
We need to be exfiling
by midnight.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.285
Spend a lot of time in the bush?

15:07.340 --> 15:10.207
You know, my father would take
me on hikes to Mayan ruins.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.299
Told me stories how they'd rip
the hearts out of their people.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.513
That kind of violence,
I couldn't imagine.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.993
Not so hard anymore, huh?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.031
Not so hard.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.525
Got a camp guarding
the back door.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.579
Five enemy, at least.

16:17.620 --> 16:20.088
Havoc, this is 1.

16:23.110 --> 16:25.578
Copy that, 1.

16:25.630 --> 16:28.019
Enemy's 20 yards northwest
of our position.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.891
All right, how many combatants?

16:30.940 --> 16:32.896
We got six visible.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.805
We engage, there
might be more.

16:36.510 --> 16:39.377
So we'll cloverleaf around them
and get back on route.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.898
All right,
keep the detour tight.

16:41.950 --> 16:45.249
You don't have much slack
In your timeline.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.734
Check.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.773
They didn't hear anything.

17:30.830 --> 17:34.175
Yeah. Didn't hear anything,
but they're gonna miss him.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.479
Doesn't have any radio on him.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.998
Cache the body.
It'll buy us a few minutes.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.919
Havoc, this is 1.
We're at the target's perimeter.

18:27.970 --> 18:30.279
ERIC:
Copy, Bravo 1. We now have ISR

18:30.320 --> 18:31.753
above your position.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.711
Got that pesky jungle
out of the way.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.149
I see 12 guards patrolling,
regular pattern of movement.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.623
Closest two are 20 yards east.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.418
Copy, Havoc.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.119
We got 'em.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.076
Guess word got out
about their buddy.

18:51.690 --> 18:52.816
Drop them.

18:56.650 --> 18:58.129
Let's go.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.909
All Bravo stations,

19:04.960 --> 19:06.359
six more enemy moving

19:06.400 --> 19:08.391
towards your position.

19:13.150 --> 19:15.141
We got six tangos
coming our way.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.363
We holding cover
or are we taking 'em from here?

19:18.890 --> 19:20.198
JASON:
Take 'em from here.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.061
On me. Execute.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.078
Move. Move.

19:54.540 --> 19:57.008
["Las Guajiras"
by Mongo Santamaria playing]

20:24.440 --> 20:26.431
Clear!

20:36.930 --> 20:38.921
Clear!

21:00.250 --> 21:02.036
Knees. Get on your knees.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.207
Keep your hands up.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.251
I didn't even hear
the doorbell ring.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.439
Havoc, this is 1. Jackpot.
Say again, jackpot.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.260
Alive?

21:11.310 --> 21:12.436
He's alive.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.180
Copy, Bravo 1. Extract helo

21:20.230 --> 21:21.834
is 30 seconds out.

21:37.810 --> 21:39.812
There's our ride.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.945
Clay, Lopez, stay here.

21:43.990 --> 21:46.208
The rest of us will _secure
a path for exfII.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.956
Not sure I'd be smiling.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.697
You've battled all this way
only to condemn yourselves.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.002
I hate to spoil it for you,
but that's not our plan, pal.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.504
I believe your plans
have changed.

22:32.430 --> 22:35.160
Where'd those shots come from?Looking.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.562
Havoc, it's 1.

22:36.610 --> 22:38.919
ERIC: Copy, Bravo 1.
We're aware of the helo.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.393
We're looking for answers.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.395
I got a convoy of vehicles

22:41.440 --> 22:42.828
converging onto Doza's property.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.869
ERIC:
Who are they?

22:43.920 --> 22:45.649
I know who.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.101
Havoc, this is 1. Sitrep?

22:55.150 --> 22:57.232
ERIC: Yeah, Bravo 1,
this is Havoc Base.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.236
Be advised that you have a force

22:59.290 --> 23:01.508
of Chiapas state police
approaching your position.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.677
Watch him.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.720
They shoot down the helo?

23:08.770 --> 23:11.204
ERIC: Affirm. They claim
the pilot was participating

23:11.250 --> 23:13.036
in the unlawful abduction
of a prisoner

23:13.080 --> 23:15.071
in their charge.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.516
They're coming for Doza.

23:26.050 --> 23:28.439
And they brought an army.

23:34.020 --> 23:35.965
This is Comandante Salas

23:36.020 --> 23:37.749
of the Chiapas state police.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.586
I am ordering you

23:39.630 --> 23:42.758
to surrender Seor
Doza peacefully,

23:42.810 --> 23:46.803
or we will take him by force.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.239
Maybe we should've had
31 minutes to plan this gig.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.246
This is Bravo 2

23:52.300 --> 23:53.949
to 4 and 5.

23:53.990 --> 23:55.810
Find watch positions.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.999
Put guns on our
visitors outside.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.428
BROCK:_ _
Copy. In posrtlon.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.561
SONNY: This is starting
to remind me of the ending

24:09.620 --> 24:11.303
of Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.782
Jason's working on it.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.569
Havoc, this is 1.
You got anyone higher up

24:14.620 --> 24:15.928
in the federal government
who can call them off?

24:15.970 --> 24:17.619
They're trying.

24:17.670 --> 24:19.752
The Chiapas governor insists
you're there unlawfully.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.971
Guess QRF's off, huh?

24:21.020 --> 24:22.624
ERIC: Look, we knew
the rules going in.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.843
If this thing goes sideways,
SEDENA's position

24:24.890 --> 24:27.450
is that Bravo team was acting
without their knowledge.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.807
Havoc, it's 1.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.930
Anyone from US. Command
telling us to stand down?

24:32.990 --> 24:35.857
ERIC:
No. But once SOCOM grasps

24:35.900 --> 24:38.949
what's going on, how long
you think that'll last, Bravo 1?

24:38.990 --> 24:41.470
Long enough for me to figure
something out, buy some time.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.988
Bravo 1 out. Guys, options.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.862
I say we, uh, dress Doza up
as a SEAL,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.478
duct tape a gun to his hand

24:49.530 --> 24:50.747
and kick him out the door.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.825
Then we talk to the
comandante out there,

24:51.880 --> 24:53.131
soldier to soldier,

24:53.180 --> 24:54.488
see if we can get his
bosses to see the light.

24:54.530 --> 24:56.782
His boss is this
psychopath right here.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.796
Controls them all.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.796
Ki|| all their families
if they don't do his bidding.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.920
I control no one.

25:01.970 --> 25:04.666
I am not a puppeteer.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.280
I lay out the options,
and people choose.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.104
We smuggle him out.

25:09.150 --> 25:11.539
Got to be armed police
at every door by now.

25:11.590 --> 25:14.411
Yeah, this guy's a drug lord.
I mean, he's built this place.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.280
He's got to have some sort
of tunnel getting out of here.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.945
There's no tunnel.Want to know where
the tunnels are.

25:18.990 --> 25:20.469
Where are the tunnels?
This goes Sideways,

25:20.510 --> 25:21.681
you're the first one
who's gonna get it.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.903
Right in the head.
You lead us out, you live.

25:23.950 --> 25:25.292
Live?

25:25.340 --> 25:27.820
In a concrete hole in America?

25:27.870 --> 25:29.826
No, thank you.

25:29.870 --> 25:33.567
Besides, you are a
soldier, not a murderer.

25:33.610 --> 25:35.874
IfI catch a bullet,
you and your men

25:35.920 --> 25:37.399
will go to jail.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.964
You will not let that happen,

25:39.010 --> 25:40.739
because you care more
about their lives

25:40.800 --> 25:42.609
than you do about my death.

25:42.670 --> 25:46.788
Ironic. I have made
you my protector.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.492
The tunnels. Where are they?
Now! Your way out!

25:50.540 --> 25:52.849
You're thinking
of Chapo, Pablo.

25:52.890 --> 25:54.801
That's the weak way,
not my way.

25:54.850 --> 25:57.068
There are no tunnels.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.418
You will let me go.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.552
You have no other choice.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.942
Back it off.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.519
Come on. Move.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.258
You should not dismiss
this conce55ion.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.993
Oh, it's a hell of a bargain.

26:15.050 --> 26:16.438
We let a mass murderer walk,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.653
and you're kind enough
not to gun down my men.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.749
SALAS: You are foreign soldiers
operating in a sovereign state.

26:21.790 --> 26:25.089
Doing as I say is the only way
this ends peacefully.

26:25.140 --> 26:29.179
Your men are outnumbered.
Stand them down,

26:29.230 --> 26:32.586
or they will die.
You have ten minutes.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.645
You feel that?

26:49.690 --> 26:51.555
That charge in the air?

26:53.780 --> 26:57.693
Same feeling before
a tornado comes.

26:57.740 --> 26:59.696
They're about to hit.

26:59.740 --> 27:01.526
DOZA:
If they do,

27:01.570 --> 27:04.528
it won't be a happy ending
for you.Yeah?

27:04.570 --> 27:06.481
I don't know about that.

27:06.530 --> 27:09.488
I got a feeling the good guys
are gonna win tonight.

27:31.470 --> 27:34.735
Havoc, this is 1. Chiapas police
are readying for engagement.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.031
ERIC:
Copy that, 1.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.513
Stand by.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.118
They should turn him over.

27:39.170 --> 27:40.512
It's not your call, Ellis.

27:40.570 --> 27:42.561
Didn't say it was.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.308
Havoc Base to Bravo 1.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.090
Turn the HVT over
and lay your weapons down.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.870
We're not losing any of you.

28:00.670 --> 28:02.672
Havoc, this is 1. Laying down.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.676
CLAY:
Jason, come on, man.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.233
Come on, boss.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.281
Weapons down. Now.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.459
You heard the man.

28:12.510 --> 28:13.636
Do it.

28:13.690 --> 28:14.907
We're not murderers.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.035
Yeah, but he's murdered

28:17.080 --> 28:18.206
thousands of people a year.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.682
If we stand down,
how many more die?

28:19.740 --> 28:20.900
I'm more concerned
about your blood.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.827
Take your weapon off,
lay it down. Now.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.519
There's no justice in this.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.560
Juan, lay down the weapon.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.269
RAY:
He'll face justice, Juan.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.618
Someday.

28:32.660 --> 28:35.618
Not here. This is Mxico.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.797
Men like him own justice here.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.888
Lay down the weapon.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.838
Lay down the weapon. Now.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.896
Havoc, this is 1.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.589
Inform Chiapas police
that we're disarmed.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.642
We're gonna hand off HVT.

29:04.430 --> 29:07.388
Ray, cut him loose.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.261
Clay, open the door
so the Chiapas police

29:10.310 --> 29:11.390
can see that we're unarmed

29:11.440 --> 29:12.782
when they're coming down
that hallway.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.706
CLAY:
Roger that.

29:20.140 --> 29:21.402
JASON: Havoc,
this is 1.

29:21.450 --> 29:22.758
Inform Chiapas police
that we are disarmed.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.751
Again, we are disarmed.

29:32.110 --> 29:33.281
TRENT:
Bravo 1,

29:33.330 --> 29:35.412
this is 4. Heard fire?

29:35.460 --> 29:37.769
4, we're good. Hey.

29:37.810 --> 29:41.291
Hey. You shouldn't have
done that. Wrong move.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.683
He had to die. I had no choice.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.601
We can't lie for you.I know.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.082
Manos arriba!

29:54.140 --> 29:55.607
SALAS:
Show us your hands.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.651
Manos arriba!

29:57.700 --> 30:00.260
Hands up now.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.701
You killed him.

30:08.190 --> 30:11.193
You killed Seor Doza.

30:26.210 --> 30:28.678
What happened here?

30:28.730 --> 30:30.516
My name is
Lieutenant Juan Lopez.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.209
I killed Andres Doza.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.820
These men followed your orders
and laid down their weapons.

30:34.870 --> 30:37.430
They had nothing
to do with this.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.038
There's_ another
p055ibility.

30:39.090 --> 30:42.742
What?It's possible, given
the current situation,

30:42.790 --> 30:44.223
that Seor Doza here

30:44.270 --> 30:46.613
knew he was gonna be extradited
to the United States.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.889
So instead of spending the
rest of his life in prison,

30:49.930 --> 30:52.398
he shot himself in the head.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.499
You will testify to that?No.

30:55.540 --> 30:58.327
I can't. But you can.

30:58.370 --> 31:02.727
Whatever Doza has over you
or this country is gone.

31:02.770 --> 31:05.284
No need to take a good man down
with him.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.988
We just want to go home.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.514
Then go home.

32:18.890 --> 32:20.846
Look, if you, uh,
feel like you need

32:20.890 --> 32:22.846
to take your family
somewhere safe,

32:22.890 --> 32:26.417
like the States, I could always
put in a good word for you.

32:26.460 --> 32:28.325
Jason Hayes, diplomat.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.245
That's right,
and it doesn't come easy.

32:30.290 --> 32:31.803
Thank you.

32:31.860 --> 32:34.499
But this is my home.
I'm going to fight for it.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.425
Well, there's gonna be
plenty of fighting.

32:36.470 --> 32:38.688
Always gonna be another Doza
in the wings.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.686
Yes, so we'll hunt them
and kill them,

32:40.740 --> 32:43.083
so one day we can say
the good guys win.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.472
It's been an honor.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.124
Take care of yourself,
all right?

32:46.180 --> 32:47.477
Likewise.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.304
Get that hat
on straight.

32:49.350 --> 32:50.521
Good luck, Lopez.

32:50.570 --> 32:52.094
Thank you.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.760
SONNY:
Mr. Spenser.

33:16.820 --> 33:17.889
Hmm?

33:17.950 --> 33:19.906
Nice cold beer
for you, buddy.

33:19.950 --> 33:22.259
Thanks, bud.Yep.

33:23.260 --> 33:24.909
So, I'll bet, uh,

33:24.950 --> 33:26.861
returning home
without Stella there

33:26.910 --> 33:30.084
doesn't make you quite as eager
for shore duty, huh?

33:31.350 --> 33:33.523
Yeah, after sharing
a hooch with you

33:33.570 --> 33:35.219
and your little night terrors,

33:35.270 --> 33:38.046
I'm actually looking forward
to getting a place of my own.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.829
Right.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.131
Yeah.

33:41.190 --> 33:44.057
I'd rather be surrounded
by a dozen Jihad Jerrys

33:44.100 --> 33:45.704
when I'm Winchester

33:45.760 --> 33:48.149
than heading home
to an empty apartment.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.929
And that is why...

33:49.980 --> 33:51.936
we're going from base
to the bar,

33:51.980 --> 33:53.322
painting the town red.

33:53.370 --> 33:55.281
Body glitter, honeys,

33:55.330 --> 33:57.855
whiskey and wine, that's
the good life right there.

33:57.900 --> 34:00.949
I appreciate you looking out
for me, brother, I do.

34:00.990 --> 34:02.639
Yeah.I'm all good.

34:02.690 --> 34:04.908
All right.

34:04.950 --> 34:07.601
Whatever you say there,
Blondzilla.

34:15.740 --> 34:17.742
You are a good friend,

34:17.790 --> 34:19.041
Sonny.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.091
Easy there, Davis.

34:21.140 --> 34:23.483
Don't you get all feely on me.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.846
You did good work, Mandy.

34:30.890 --> 34:32.494
You did really good.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.269
I failed with Rita.

34:34.330 --> 34:35.718
Hmm?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.546
No, no. No, you didn't.
You didn't fail with Rita.

34:37.590 --> 34:38.670
Okay? Rita failed herself.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.676
Ibuilt
the Doza target package,

34:40.730 --> 34:42.413
piece by piece.

34:42.470 --> 34:44.370
I should have seen it coming.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.819
I should be better than that.

34:46.860 --> 34:51.638
And if... I stopped the ambush,
Martinez would be alive.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.295
It's over. Game's over.
Doza's dead.

34:54.350 --> 34:55.999
Don't beat yourself up.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.177
Victory came at a steep price.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.176
Always comes
at a steep price.

35:00.220 --> 35:02.131
You know that.
I know that.

35:02.180 --> 35:05.707
We also know that this was...
supposed to be imp055ible.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.355
Look what you were working with.
You had a shred of intel, right?

35:08.410 --> 35:10.628
You had a traitor constantly
looking over your shoulder.

35:10.670 --> 35:13.628
You had a corrupt government
that was in bed with Doza,

35:13.670 --> 35:16.719
and yet you still managed
to get to Doza's den.

35:16.760 --> 35:19.752
And he's the one
who ended up horizontal.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.323
It was worth it, right?

35:22.380 --> 35:24.063
Yeah.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.985
We saved lives, and...

35:26.030 --> 35:28.498
Martinez, he...

35:28.560 --> 35:30.642
he's at peace.

35:30.690 --> 35:32.510
Died a hero.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.164
No regrets.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.826
No regrets.None.

35:36.870 --> 35:40.124
You know what we do,
there's always a cost, Mandy.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.171
Just want you to know
you don't have to hurt alone.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.176
Tell you what,
I'm not a big hugger,

35:44.220 --> 35:45.949
but I'll make _
an exception this time.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.398
Come on,
give me a hug.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.486
Get over here.

35:48.530 --> 35:50.839
Come on.
There it is.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.745
You did good.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.405
Really good.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.939
How'd it go?

36:09.990 --> 36:11.594
It went good.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.949
I'm getting a lot better.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.381
Why are you driving
Dad's truck?

36:17.430 --> 36:19.250
'Cause Dad's out of town.

36:21.090 --> 36:22.478
Dad'll be psyched.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.999
First game's coming up.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.995
Oh, my gosh, I know.
I cannot wait.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.041
It's gonna be so fun.

36:37.450 --> 36:38.530
All right.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.496
Okay.

36:48.070 --> 36:49.378
Taco time!

36:49.420 --> 36:52.412
Taco time!Oh, my... What?

36:52.470 --> 36:53.812
You jerk!

36:53.860 --> 36:55.293
What are you doing here?Ha-ha!

36:55.340 --> 36:57.205
How did you know
we were here?
Like I said,

36:57.250 --> 37:00.208
I have drones in the slq
over you at all times.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.773
Oh.I told you that, right?

37:01.820 --> 37:04.129
Ha! Wait, whoa, whoa,
wait a second. I'm sorry.

37:04.170 --> 37:05.774
Why are you driving my truck?

37:05.830 --> 37:07.127
That's what I said.Because you're

37:07.180 --> 37:09.603
supposed to be out of town.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.481
Did you really have to scare
the living hell out of us?I loved it.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.009
The look on your faces
was priceless.

37:14.050 --> 37:15.267
I'll always remember that.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.833
Taco time!:
Stop!

37:16.880 --> 37:18.131
Wait. Time out.What?

37:18.190 --> 37:19.873
What are you...
Get out of the car.

37:19.930 --> 37:21.181
I'm driving. Let's go.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.580
Yo.

37:27.630 --> 37:29.063
Where's Clay?Whoa.

37:29.110 --> 37:31.101
Thought you guys were
gonna paint the town.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.151
Uh, yeah,
my little buddy bailed.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.589
Said something
about sleep.
Aw.

37:35.640 --> 37:39.076
Well, that means staring at the
ceiling, thinking about Stella.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.078
Yeah, I feel for him.How's he doing?

37:42.120 --> 37:46.295
Uh, como ceviche,uh,
"lower than a gopher hole"

37:46.350 --> 37:48.818
There. Pull up
a chair there, Norm.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.599
Hmm.Don't make me drink alone.

37:51.830 --> 37:54.003
Hey, Tommy, can I get
two shots of whiskey?

37:54.050 --> 37:55.301
The cheap kind.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.305
I didn't bring any cash.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.577
You got cash?Mm-hmm.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.269
The expensive kind.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.278
[Mad Season's
"River of Deceit" playing]

38:33.260 --> 38:35.524
My pain

38:38.050 --> 38:40.917
Is self chosen

38:44.140 --> 38:46.927
At least

38:48.100 --> 38:51.661
So the prophet says

38:57.200 --> 39:00.374
I could either burn

39:02.770 --> 39:05.238
Or cut off my pride

39:05.290 --> 39:07.110
And buy some time

39:09.210 --> 39:11.075
A head full of lies

39:11.130 --> 39:12.688
Is the weight

39:12.740 --> 39:15.732
Tied to my waist

39:21.140 --> 39:23.870
The river of deceit

39:23.920 --> 39:27.310
Pulls down

39:27.360 --> 39:29.351
Oh

39:31.360 --> 39:34.659
The only direction we flow

39:34.720 --> 39:36.494
Is down

39:37.980 --> 39:40.232
Down

39:40.290 --> 39:41.973
Oh, down...

39:46.340 --> 39:49.116
Oh, and there I was,
butt naked, no passport,

39:49.160 --> 39:51.469
in Kuwait with
my buddy JT.

39:54.430 --> 39:56.386
Oh, man. Here.Oh...

39:56.430 --> 39:57.954
It's getting to be that hour.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.468
Call me crazy, but the
last time we were here,

40:00.520 --> 40:02.215
didn't we, uh...

40:02.260 --> 40:03.739
What?

40:03.790 --> 40:05.746
I mean, not that
we would ever...

40:05.790 --> 40:07.007
That was a moment.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.655
That was a fleeting moment.Fleeting?

40:09.710 --> 40:11.132
Fleeting.Right.

40:11.190 --> 40:12.407
Yeah.

40:12.450 --> 40:14.224
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:25.330 --> 40:26.934
Come here.

40:36.690 --> 40:39.158
Everybody's good.

40:39.210 --> 40:42.600
I mean, the team.
I mean, we're all home safe.

40:42.650 --> 40:44.732
Everybody's alive.

40:46.790 --> 40:49.179
Mikey is crushing it in hockey.

40:49.220 --> 40:51.302
You'd be proud.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.873
Emma...

40:52.920 --> 40:55.878
Emma, well, you know,
she's a teenager,

40:55.930 --> 40:58.626
so there's that, right?

40:58.670 --> 41:01.571
But, um...

41:01.630 --> 41:04.235
she's just like you, Alana.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.158
Everything's different
with you gone.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.419
I don't know how
any of this works without you.

41:11.940 --> 41:13.851
You know, you know,
I'm on the team.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.891
When I'm deployed,
everything's good.

41:15.950 --> 41:17.508
When I'm back home, you know,

41:17.560 --> 41:20.028
I can convince everybody
that I'm good,

41:20.080 --> 41:22.947
but, you know,
deep down, I'm not.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.695
I'm not.

41:26.740 --> 41:29.607
I'm scared.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.525
I'm alone.

41:33.530 --> 41:36.090
It mixes me up.

41:37.970 --> 41:40.700
I don't know what
to do next here, Alana.

41:40.750 --> 41:42.923
What do I do?

41:44.580 --> 41:46.536
Down

41:46.590 --> 41:48.455
Oh, down

41:49.940 --> 41:51.020
Down

41:52.200 --> 41:53.974
Oh, down...

41:54.030 --> 41:56.066
How do you unbreak the broke?

41:56.120 --> 41:57.064
Down

41:57.120 --> 41:59.896
Oh, down...
