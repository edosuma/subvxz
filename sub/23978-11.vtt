01:27.212 --> 01:29.088
Okay...

01:33.259 --> 01:34.385
You killed him.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.889
He's dead. You took a life.
You're going to jail.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.099
You have to run.
He would've killed you.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.351
Mother-daughter cellmates.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.311
Need to blow town.
He's dead. I have to hide.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.021
Can't hide.
You have to take the blame.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.732
You deserve the death penalty!
He hurt your mom.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.959
You killed again.

01:48.983 --> 01:52.278
It was an accident.
You have to make it...

01:52.362 --> 01:54.114
...look like a suicide.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.846
Stop.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.740
Rise and shine. You ready for breakfast?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.826
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.585
You wanna spend the day
in a bullshit power struggle?

04:12.669 --> 04:16.755
Or can we agree on a little mutual respect
and get through it in peace? Hmm?

04:24.180 --> 04:27.183
- Where's Dale?
- Ah, she speaks.

04:30.728 --> 04:33.690
I thought Dale was in charge of me.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.650
Lucky you. He didn't show.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.320
Eat your eggs before they get cold.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.452
Is that usual?
Him not showing up to work?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.747
He's not a usual dude.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.624
What? I'm not good enough for you?

04:52.709 --> 04:53.918
The opposite.

04:54.002 --> 04:57.088
Well, let's just enjoy his day off, then.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.840
Eggs?

05:06.014 --> 05:10.768
Um, may I make a phone call
before I eat my breakfast?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.604
You trying to take advantage
of the substitute teacher?

05:13.688 --> 05:15.857
No, no. It's just, um...

05:15.940 --> 05:20.570
My daughter had a blind date last night.
I wanna make sure she got home safe.

05:25.950 --> 05:32.123
I talk to my girl every damn day,
whether she wants to or not.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.046
You never stop being a mom, do you?

05:40.757 --> 05:41.758
Never.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.755
Shit.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.652
You have a collect call
from an inmate

07:36.706 --> 07:39.959
at a New York state correctional facility.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.420
To accept, press one.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.798
To decline, press two or simply hang up.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.269
Jessica? You there?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.063
Those clicks mean we're not alone.

08:01.898 --> 08:06.277
I know. I just...
I wanted to hear your voice.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.574
Can we talk later?
This really isn't a good time for me.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.743
I have a new guard this morning.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.538
Dale didn't show up to work.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.375
His replacement's nice.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.711
She let me call you.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.882
Okay.

08:29.342 --> 08:33.054
So, um...
uh, did you have a date last night?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.472
What?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.265
Did you go out?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.438
Yeah.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.985
Yeah, I went out.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.697
I didn't want you to do that.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.659
And I should've listened.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.120
Are you okay?

09:00.581 --> 09:01.916
Jessica?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.417
Yeah, I'm fine. Just...

09:04.919 --> 09:07.630
Don't get worked up, okay?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.006
Did you clean up?

09:09.090 --> 09:13.302
The apartment?
You always were such a slob as a kid.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.846
I know how to clean.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.434
Good.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.230
Good.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.785
I'm so proud of you.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.250
Just be okay, Mom.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.910
I'm proud of you, too.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.508
Extortion. Forgery.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.134
And now murder.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.846
Is there no crime
Jessica Jones won't commit

11:20.930 --> 11:22.264
to get what she wants?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.184
Main Street,

11:26.394 --> 11:27.520
Birch Street,

11:28.896 --> 11:30.731
- Higgins Drive...
- Higgins Drive.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.109
- Cobalt Lane.
- Cobalt Lane.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.738
I know all the quaint side streets
of your mind, Jessica.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.365
Every dark little alley.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.285
I just need sleep.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.832
I'll be in your dreams, too.
I'm inside you forever.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.506
Karl?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.805
Killing him would've been
much more effective.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.351
You're not here.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.312
Well, neither is Karl.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.064
Crawl back into whatever hell
you came from.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.275
I'm serving too valuable a purpose.

12:56.358 --> 13:00.571
- To drive me crazy?
- To ease your mind. Tell you it's okay.

13:00.654 --> 13:04.325
"I'm okay, you're okay."
You read that on a greetings card once.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.534
Clearly had impact.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.579
I have work to do.

13:08.662 --> 13:09.830
Here to help.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.250
First of all, the bed's still made.
He didn't sleep here.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.921
Left his coat. Odd.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.842
He was almost packed.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.844
Waiting for you?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.655
Mmm, musings of a warped mind.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.367
He's run off to make more superfreaks.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.745
Not without his room key.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.830
Someone took him?

13:51.914 --> 13:55.459
Oh, mommy's gonna go insane.
Well, more insane.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.756
She won't. Because I'm gonna find him.

14:02.716 --> 14:06.971
And you'll finish him. You're a pro now.
Three lives and counting.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.072
Heard about it in the break room
this morning.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.242
Man, sounds like a gory way to go.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.953
At least we don't have to take orders
from him anymore.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.329
Guy was messed up.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.540
Total psycho.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.377
Figures he'd spread his own brains
all over the sidewalk.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.025
I'm Officer Toussaint.
You're Alisa's little girl.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.110
She's been bragging on you all morning.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.905
Yeah. Thanks.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.074
- Marilyn has a daughter, too.
- At the police academy.

15:09.158 --> 15:13.037
I hear you know something about law
and order. Private eye, huh?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.580
It pays the bills.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.457
Jessica was the one who turned me in.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.710
Norman Rockwell didn't paint that one.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.796
Mothers and daughters. Complicated.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.216
Would I be able to have a few moments
alone with my daughter?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.509
Against the new protocol.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.387
The security cameras
will be on us the whole time.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.514
It would mean the world to me, Marilyn.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.521
We'll be right outside the door.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.689
Ten minutes.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.036
What a difference a guard makes.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.706
Are you okay?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.959
I haven't slept.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.836
Afraid he'll be in your dreams?

16:04.922 --> 16:05.923
Who?

16:07.257 --> 16:08.258
Dale.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.553
I have ghosts, too.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.055
They fade.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.890
Not always.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.601
He was an evil prick. Sleep on that.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.398
So, I was wondering if, uh...

16:25.150 --> 16:27.569
Karl had any friends or people he might...

16:27.653 --> 16:29.113
Friends? Why?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.031
It's no big deal.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.119
He just...
He stepped out last night, and I...

16:35.202 --> 16:36.954
- He checked out?
- No.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.417
Don't get upset.
I'm just curious where he could've gone.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.085
Did he have his papers?

16:43.168 --> 16:44.461
I was trying to deliver them.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.297
He wouldn't leave without his papers.
He wouldn't just leave.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.010
Don't worry about it.
Finding people is what I do.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.429
Did you tell Trish where he was?
Did she know?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.014
No, of course not.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.557
It has to be Trish.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.309
She wanted me to give him up.
Me. The little moron.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.602
It's not Trish.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.522
With her pseudo-noble bullshit.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.068
Trish doesn't know, okay?

17:08.152 --> 17:12.364
I swear, if it is her,
I will break her bottle-blond head.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.616
Mom, I fixed your other problem, didn't I?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.577
I'll fix this.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.497
Do you trust me?

17:23.459 --> 17:27.087
Yeah. I trust you. I do.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.257
I promise everything is gonna be okay.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.759
It better be.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.975
♪ Hey, hey
I want your cray cray ♪

17:40.059 --> 17:41.977
Oh, mommy does have a point.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.396
Trish has been a little cray cray lately.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.106
Because she's on drugs.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.777
Thanks to the addictive work product of
a certain doctor who's recently vanished.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.030
Never trust a junkie.
Especially a self-righteous one.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.699
Trish isn't that screwed up.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.367
It's not like she has you in her head.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.536
Oh, yeah, she just wants
to bring him to justice.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.790
Please. There's only one path
to true justice.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.209
- You're getting very good at it.
- Shit.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.961
Trish. Please call me back.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.424

I want your cray cray ♪

18:12.508 --> 18:13.425

Get out!

18:22.768 --> 18:24.812
It's just you and me now.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.439
Like it always should've been.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.193
If I believed that,
I'd put a bullet in my brain.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.736
As if you'd need a gun.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.198
Karl's probably safer with Trish.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.991
She'd never kill someone.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.828
It's not in her DNA like it is in yours.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.080
It's not in my freaking DNA.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.542
Oh, just embrace it.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.544
You murdered Dale, and now...

18:48.627 --> 18:50.212
It was self-defense, dickwad.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.172
Don't deny it. Own it.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.717
He was a twisted, sadistic shithead
who deserved it.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.969
Like you?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.638
Yes! Just like me!

18:59.721 --> 19:03.308
Murdering me
was as poetic as justice ever gets!

19:03.392 --> 19:04.977
You got your mother locked up.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.604
So you were the reason
that she was being tortured by Dale.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.315
You solved that problem.
You helped your mommy.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.735
It's what you do, isn't it?
You help people.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.657
Hey, I'm just a thought.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.870
I have to find Karl.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
What the hell?

19:29.501 --> 19:32.212
Mmm, who's been using your computer?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.969
You just invite betrayal, don't you?

19:57.946 --> 20:00.306
They're together, of course.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.205
Sticking their tongues
in each other's body parts,

20:06.830 --> 20:08.415
swapping fluids.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.125
Thanks for the visual.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.752
- Reminds me of us.
- No.

20:12.961 --> 20:16.006
I will tear out my own brain
before I let you go there.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.307
All right. Where did you take him,
you little shit?

20:30.562 --> 20:33.190
- Jesus.
- Ooh, porn.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.393
It's a dating app.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.401
Which he goes to a lot.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.738
Trading one addiction for another.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.324
Well, if something works, keep doing it.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.659
Right, killer?

20:45.244 --> 20:50.332
Oh, sweet. Jacqui is only 4,810 feet away.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.293
The lovely Tess is 1.2 miles away.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.673
Okay, if I triangulate their distances
from Malcolm's phone...

20:59.549 --> 21:01.051
Empty anonymous sex.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.887
We should sign you up. You can be JJ.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.472
Five-foot-nine, athletic.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.891
Enjoys leather in all seasons,
justifiable homicide

21:07.975 --> 21:10.352
and long walks on the beach
to dump the body.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.895
And you could be KK.

21:11.979 --> 21:16.608
Bony, translucent Brit. Enjoys rape.
Also, dead.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.411
I'm trading banter with a delusion.

21:40.215 --> 21:44.303
Dust-free storage facility, my ass.
Look at the filth on these things.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.972
- Will it still work?
- Won't know for sure until we plug it in.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.474
They look functional.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.355
Here we go.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.818
Eight years of my life in this case.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.281
Perfect as the day I designed it.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.158
Then let's go.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.248
Do you really need the gun?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.624
Where were you gonna run?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.293
Who's running?

22:16.376 --> 22:20.339
With your new passports.
Where were you running?

22:20.422 --> 22:21.548
Uruguay.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.009
Lot of cutting-edge science in Uruguay?

22:24.092 --> 22:25.135
Hardly.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.929
So you were just gonna go there
and you were gonna read? Garden?

22:28.013 --> 22:30.140
Learn basket weaving?

22:30.223 --> 22:33.060
Or you'll just sit, smoke,
wait to die alone?

22:33.143 --> 22:36.023
You already have me at gunpoint.
You don't have to crush my soul as well.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.190
Maybe you will reflect
on your life's work.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.443
Hurting people. Creating a killer.

22:41.526 --> 22:45.530
I wanted to save people.
I did save people.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.825
But the science was never harnessed,
never perfected.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.160
So you failed.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.454
That's your legacy.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.083
But listen, it doesn't have to be.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.919
You wanted to be extraordinary.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.003
Right?

23:02.672 --> 23:04.466
Maybe you still can be.

23:06.384 --> 23:10.097
Why don't you tell me,
do I really need the gun?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.392
Oh, my God. Patsy?

23:15.894 --> 23:18.188
- Get in the car. Go.
- Can I get a picture?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.111
I'm so sorry,
I'm actually really late.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.609
- Just one picture! You're my hero!
- I said no.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.948
Nasty woman. Whew.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.803
You've reached Malcolm Ducasse,

23:49.886 --> 23:52.222
associate investigator
at Alias Investigations.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.224
Please leave a detailed message.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.602
Hey, assclown.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.564
Turning off Find My Phone
won't hide you from me.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.919
Jacqui? You don't know me.
I'm looking for Malcolm.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.008
Please don't hang up. I just need you
to check your Teaser app.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.556
He's an addict, Caroline,
and he's on a binge.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.224
Can you please just check your app?

24:36.933 --> 24:39.936
Tess, okay, calm down.
I will get him to rehab.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.104
How far is he from you?

24:41.188 --> 24:43.982
And you're at 53rd and 9th? Thanks, Leeza.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.445
Yeah, one day at a time.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.624
He's only five blocks away.
The irony is piling up.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.992
- Malcolm, I'm sorry.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.956
I didn't know
what I was gonna do until right...

25:38.036 --> 25:41.331
- Before you hit me in back of the head?
- I practically begged you to leave.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.833
- Who is this guy?
- The sucker she had locked in the trunk,

25:43.917 --> 25:46.586
while you guys were out on whatever
little shopping trip from hell.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.879
You said the trunk was broken.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.683
Said we couldn't use it. Malcolm,
you don't get what's going on here.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.467
I get that you used me.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.929
All you care about is drugs
and being stronger for five minutes.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.812
But that inhaler crap is not gonna fix
the messed up shit in your head.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.058
Stay right there.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.399
- Are you serious?
- Come on, put the gun away.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.527
You're not gonna kill me.

26:16.032 --> 26:20.078
I am not gonna kill you,
but I will not let you stop me either.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.500
Get in the car. Go!

26:28.169 --> 26:31.798
- You're a doctor enabling an addict.
- I know what I'm doing.

26:34.175 --> 26:38.680
Trish, you should be in rehab.
And he should be in jail.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.851
I will do the right thing with him after.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.604
- After what?
- You'll understand, Malcolm. Just...

26:49.232 --> 26:50.317
Trish!

26:55.905 --> 26:57.240
Trish, stop!

27:31.733 --> 27:33.735
These marine biologists

27:33.818 --> 27:37.113
have been in the Pacific Ocean
for nearly four months,

27:37.197 --> 27:39.658
detailing the Marianas Trench,

27:39.741 --> 27:43.370
the deepest known point
in the Earth's seabed hydrosphere.

27:44.704 --> 27:48.249
If Mount Everest were placed
in the trench at this point,

27:48.333 --> 27:51.169
it would still be over a mile underwater.

27:52.253 --> 27:57.592
Its maximum known depth
is 10,994 meters...

28:15.777 --> 28:18.863
- Your heart rate dropped.
- The ocean calms me down.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.450
Is it the sight? The smell? A memory?

28:22.534 --> 28:26.871
You can't stop, can you? With the science.
Not even for a minute.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.206
You fascinate me.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.126
My powers fascinate you.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.836
It's not just that.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.717
Took me a long time to feel
comfortable around the ocean.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.510
Why?

28:41.052 --> 28:43.847
Uh, nearly drowned
on a family vacation.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.598
So what made you go back in?

28:47.475 --> 28:51.396
Some of my colleagues had a theory
that needed to be tested at sea.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.775
Um, I wanted to help,
so I put on a life jacket.

28:55.859 --> 28:56.943
Noble of you.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.487
Not really.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.948
They were paying for the research,
and I was low on grass.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.412
Well...

29:07.954 --> 29:11.666
it's powerful,
and it's unpredictable.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.752
That can be scary for some people.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.503
Yeah, the grass can do that.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.840
- I meant the ocean.
- Ah...

29:20.133 --> 29:21.176
Not you?

29:22.051 --> 29:25.221
No. That's why I love it.

29:26.431 --> 29:31.269
My whole life, I was told
to be polite and to behave.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.690
The ocean doesn't give a shit.

29:37.525 --> 29:43.239
It cries and it laughs and it rages
and it takes what it wants.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.284
I can't do that.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.997
But I can watch it, and I can feel...

29:52.957 --> 29:53.958
free.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.427
We should go. People are coming out.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.596
- You're doing fine.
- No, Karl. Karl.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.807
I brought you here to tell you something.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.683
I'm closing down the clinic.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.189
Dr. Hansen, Kozlov,
I can't trust them anymore.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.818
I'm not ready.
You can't send me out there alone.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.653
I'm not sending you anywhere.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.825
I'll get us a little place by the water.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.911
Somewhere safe. It'll just be you and me.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.795
I can't let you give up
your life's work for me.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.507
This is what I want.
Not because I'm your doctor,

30:42.590 --> 30:45.844
not because you're
the most powerful woman I've ever met...

30:45.927 --> 30:48.304
I can jump ten stories,
but I can't grow hair.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.682
What kind of a lame-ass power is that?

30:50.765 --> 30:53.893
I know it's complicated.
It's completely unethical.

30:53.977 --> 30:57.397
I'm an illegal experiment,
and you're worried about ethics?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.572
Screw ethics.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.420
Count! 52935...

31:22.088 --> 31:24.340
96281...

31:27.468 --> 31:29.721
- I screwed up. I know that.
- You work for me.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.306
- I do.
- Your dick works for Trish.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.975
She said she wanted to bring Karl in
because you couldn't.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.977
She wanted another goddamn inhaler.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.146
You're a junkie.
You should've known better.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.689
Get outta my face!

31:39.772 --> 31:41.149
I'm gonna find Trish.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.472
Trish is my problem, not yours.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.777
She played me. You think that felt good?

31:44.861 --> 31:47.261
Think I felt like a hero
when I woke up in her goddamn trunk?

31:47.322 --> 31:49.562
Is that what you wanted to be?
Wanted to be Trish's hero?

31:49.616 --> 31:51.451
I trusted her and she used me.

31:51.534 --> 31:55.163
So, either we help each other
or I'm gonna find her on my own.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.791
How? Do you know anything?
Did you see where she was headed?

31:58.875 --> 32:01.377
They had a shopping bag
when they came back to the car.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.171
- From where?
- I don't know.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.714
- Jesus Christ.
- Useless.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.967
Should've left him where I put him,
on the street with a needle in his arm.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.261
It had a logo on it.
Like, something green.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.640
Oh, gadzooks! He's done it again!

32:13.723 --> 32:16.059
- Like a leaf or a tree.
- So go find it.

32:17.685 --> 32:20.355
Before we pummel
your barely functioning brain!

32:21.189 --> 32:23.274
She doesn't even wanna be rescued.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.068
She's not thinking clearly.

32:25.151 --> 32:28.237
She's probably going through withdrawal.
She's crawling out of her skin.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.448
- She's a shit friend anyway.
- Jessica.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.909
Utterly unsupportive.
Too busy chasing a fix.

32:32.992 --> 32:33.910
Jessica!

32:33.993 --> 32:36.829
- She's a complete hypocrite.
- You can't trust anyone except me.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.540
Hiding behind
that self-righteous do-gooder crap...

32:39.624 --> 32:41.960
What else has the greedy little user
been lying about?

32:42.043 --> 32:44.671
Find her and punch her
in that perky blond head.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.006
Jessica! Over here!

33:17.620 --> 33:19.390
Trish Walker, was she in here?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.833
- What?
- It's Patsy? Trish Talk?

33:21.916 --> 33:24.335
- It's not really my demo.
- Blonde, yea-high, pretty.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.004
Sidekick's a guy in his 60s,

33:26.087 --> 33:28.381
smart enough to ask
for whatever he wanted by name.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.634
How much? They paid. Can you?

33:31.718 --> 33:33.052
I've got 20 bucks.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.847
You know what? Take a walk
or adopt a cat. They're free.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.057
Ow! Ow! Let go of me!

33:39.225 --> 33:41.436
Oh, there's dog piss in here!

33:41.519 --> 33:43.855
Unless you wanna spend
the night in a dog kennel,

33:43.938 --> 33:45.940
you're gonna tell me
what they carried out of here.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.277
FVRCP, the feline distemper vaccine.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.361
What else?

33:51.279 --> 33:53.573
It's gonna be a long night in there.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.034
Telazol. An anesthetic.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.369
- As in unconscious?
- Duh.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.538
What?

34:01.456 --> 34:03.166
This isn't about the inhaler.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.835
Hey! You guys gonna let me out of here?

34:10.672 --> 34:13.384
Is this where it happened? Jessica?

34:14.427 --> 34:19.139
It's where it all happened.
So many ideas were born here.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.739
Just guarding against disruptions.

34:34.822 --> 34:38.743
Dangerous to the procedure.
But you can walk out any time you want.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.705
How long will it take?

34:42.789 --> 34:47.001
Jessica took 20 days.
But she was near death.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.255
And I've been honing
the procedure ever since.

34:52.297 --> 34:55.009
On paper at least.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.219
That's a plus.

34:56.302 --> 34:59.180
Jessica and Alisa's abilities
were a rare side effect,

34:59.263 --> 35:01.516
related to their specific DNA.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.352
I was never able to decode it.

35:04.435 --> 35:08.981
So my DNA is a crapshoot?
Just wanna know what I'm getting into.

35:10.691 --> 35:16.405
Uh, this vaccine is a live virus.
Its DNA can unlock yours.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.200
It's the first step
in editing your personal genome.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.953
- But it could all...
- Go terribly wrong.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.623
- You've said.
- Are you changing your mind?

35:28.292 --> 35:30.586
Do you know what it's like
to feel powerless?

35:30.670 --> 35:31.671
Everyone does.

35:31.754 --> 35:35.341
Not everyone has an abusive mother
and a superpowered sister.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.637
I just wanna help people
who can't help themselves.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.682
God, I sound like
an insurance commercial.

35:42.765 --> 35:47.478
No, no, no. You sound like somebody
who wants to save the world. I do, too.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.199
- Needles freak you out?
- Big time.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.995
I'm sorry. Because I need this
to retrieve your cellular data.

36:04.078 --> 36:06.622
And to begin the process.

36:06.706 --> 36:11.502
And these to reintroduce
the modified genetic code to your DNA.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.340
Okay.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.302
Here's to saving the world.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.933
Trish wants Karl
to operate on her.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.644
His experiments have killed people.
She'd never trust him.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.980
She has to if she wants to be like me.

36:31.063 --> 36:36.110
Except she would be a real hero.
Super-Patsy, Patsy-Woman, Captain Patsy.

36:36.861 --> 36:37.987
Jessica, stop!

36:38.070 --> 36:40.114
She'll look better than you in tights.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.699
Wait. Where are we even going?

36:42.950 --> 36:44.619
I don't know.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.581
- Jess?
- You're not gonna make it.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.834
- Shut up.
- What?

36:51.918 --> 36:54.238
She can be the hero.
You be the villain you are.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.380
- Shut up!
- I didn't say anything.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.344
You can kill mumsy's boyfriend
without all this self-loathing.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.136
- Shut up!
- What about equipment? What kind of...

37:02.220 --> 37:05.973
You've killed for far less.
Just embrace it. It's who we are.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.309
- The clinic.
- In Hunter's Point?

37:08.392 --> 37:11.854
You know what you have to do, Jessica.
This is all on you.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.731
Whiskey? Come on!

37:13.814 --> 37:16.692
The monster meets her maker.
Mumsy deserves it.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.277
The showdown we've been waiting for.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.863
- Come on, Jessica!
- Jess, what is going on?

37:20.947 --> 37:23.115
Don't make me
disappointed in you, Jessica!

37:23.199 --> 37:25.826
Come on. Smile for me.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.331
Jessica, stop!
What the hell are you doing? Let him go!

37:31.290 --> 37:32.792
Let him go!

37:33.751 --> 37:34.919
Hey!

37:35.002 --> 37:36.202
What was that about?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.589
Step back! Get away from him. Jesus.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.092
- I'm calling the cops. I'm calling them.
- Just go!

37:41.175 --> 37:42.218
I got this.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.680
- Crazy, man!
- It's all good, man.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.246
Shut it down, Karl. Now!

38:10.329 --> 38:14.083
- It's what she wants! It's gonna work!
- Let me in! Let me in.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.717
- No. No, no, no, no...
- Let me in!

38:23.467 --> 38:24.844
I can fix it!

38:25.469 --> 38:26.887
You're killing her!

38:33.853 --> 38:34.979
I can do this.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.906
- Shut it down!
- I can't.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.850
Then I will.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.245
Okay.

38:53.998 --> 38:58.002
Trish. Trish. Come on.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.795
Trish.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.716
- You sick dirtbag!
- He has to pay.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.718
- What did you do to her?
- I can help.

39:05.801 --> 39:08.763
You think I would let you touch her
after what you did to me?

39:08.846 --> 39:11.223
Ripped you from a hospital bed.
Twenty days of torture.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.892
Turned your mother into a murderer!

39:12.975 --> 39:14.560
- You're the killer.
- No! I'm not.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.229
- You are a deranged butcher!
- And he'll never stop.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.397
And you'll never stop.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.691
He forced this on you.
This rage, this power.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.194
- Unless I stop you.
- Use it. Kill him.

39:25.321 --> 39:29.075
This is your fault. You made me.
You did this to me.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.952
Jessica... do it!

39:49.303 --> 39:52.014
Your life is over.

39:56.185 --> 39:59.897
Trish? Trish, it's okay.
I'm gonna get you to the hospital.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.483
Come on. You're gonna be okay.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.112
Come here. Trish? Trish?

40:06.195 --> 40:08.072
Oh, God. Hang in there.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.419
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

40:23.212 --> 40:27.967
You're right. This is all I can create.
This is useless.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.678
Karl, don't.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.556
Useless as the man who built it.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.436
This is where it ends.
It has to be destroyed.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.064
- Stop it.
- Tell your mother...

40:44.859 --> 40:46.068
I'm sorry.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.903
- No.
- Run!

40:47.987 --> 40:51.073
Shit. Trish, come on. Come on.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.709
I have no ST elevations
right now...

41:43.792 --> 41:45.252
High-flow O2, wide open.

41:52.927 --> 41:53.928
Any word?

41:58.390 --> 41:59.808
She could die.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.311
Or be a vegetable.

42:03.395 --> 42:05.231
She's strong. She'll make it.

42:08.817 --> 42:11.070
She is a dying lab rat.

42:13.572 --> 42:17.493
Jess, I'm so sorry.
I thought we were helping you.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.995
Why don't you help yourself?

42:21.580 --> 42:22.873
Because you can't, can you?

42:22.957 --> 42:26.669
So you obsess over everybody else's shit
instead of dealing with your own.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.337
Hey, I am dealing with my shit...

42:28.420 --> 42:31.006
Sticking your dick in anything that moves

42:31.090 --> 42:33.551
is the same thing
as sticking a needle in your arm.

42:34.176 --> 42:38.305
But you know what? I don't give a shit
what you stick where,

42:38.389 --> 42:40.307
as long as you do it far away from me.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.184
Everything that I've done for you,

42:42.268 --> 42:45.271
peeling your sorry ass
off the floor every single morning,

42:45.354 --> 42:49.817
working late every single night
just to keep this sinking ship afloat?

42:49.900 --> 42:53.112
- Why do you think I did all that?
- Because you have nowhere else to be.

42:53.195 --> 42:56.073
Because I believe in you
and what we could do.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.534
Maybe I've been wasting my time.

42:58.617 --> 42:59.785
I relied on you.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.246
I don't rely on anyone,
and I relied on you.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.455
It's my job.

43:03.539 --> 43:04.748
Not anymore.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.587
You're just some guy
who lives down the hall.

43:17.386 --> 43:20.389
Well, just in case
you change your mind, again...

43:21.599 --> 43:22.600
I quit.

43:40.784 --> 43:43.370
Awfully proud of ourselves,
aren't we?

43:44.288 --> 43:46.248
You're in here, but I won.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.669
Dr. Frankenpiss is dead either way.

43:54.214 --> 43:56.008
He did that to himself.

43:56.091 --> 43:59.094
Tell mommy that.
I'm sure she'll forgive you.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.264
After she takes out
half the Eastern Seaboard.

44:04.016 --> 44:07.144
- She still has me.
- Like you're enough.

44:10.439 --> 44:13.317
- I'm enough.
- Because you didn't kill today?

44:13.400 --> 44:16.779
You sure did yesterday,
and you will again.

44:17.363 --> 44:18.364
No.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.949
Don't lie to yourself.

44:22.493 --> 44:27.581
I felt you shudder when you were so close.
You wanted it. And that terrifies you.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.707
It should.

44:33.879 --> 44:35.506
Because I'm not a killer.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.426
I'm not you.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.514
I'm not my mother.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.894
I can control myself.

44:55.150 --> 44:58.195
Which means I'm more powerful
than you ever were.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.498
I'll be around if you need me.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.968
Expect sunny weather this weekend,

45:18.048 --> 45:19.550
with clouds on Monday and Tuesday.

45:19.633 --> 45:23.971
It looks like a good chance of rain
for Wednesday and the rest of the week.

45:24.054 --> 45:25.597
And now for breaking news.

45:25.681 --> 45:29.643
In a bizarre twist, social media
is connecting the victim of a fire

45:29.726 --> 45:33.480
to child star
and talk show host Trish Walker.

45:33.564 --> 45:37.901
An abandoned industrial garment warehouse
went up in flames tonight.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.362
Police are reporting one casualty.

45:40.446 --> 45:45.117
This man, Dr. Karl Malus, 57,
a retired physician.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.287
A chilling fan photo taken earlier
in the day

45:48.370 --> 45:53.417
suggests Trish Walker herself was
the last person to see Dr. Malus alive.

45:53.500 --> 45:57.379
Police are wondering
exactly who Patsy's friends are.

46:02.676 --> 46:06.388
No. No! No!

46:11.768 --> 46:13.187
No!

46:15.272 --> 46:16.815
No!

46:17.733 --> 46:19.735
Jones? You all right?

46:20.986 --> 46:22.237
No!

46:25.991 --> 46:27.576
No. No.

46:27.659 --> 46:30.537
Jones, answer me.

46:35.751 --> 46:36.835
Inmate.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.089
Inmate?

46:44.927 --> 46:46.178
Do you need a medic?

46:57.314 --> 46:59.525
...repeat, immediately to C-Block!
