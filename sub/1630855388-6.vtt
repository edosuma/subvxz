WEBVTT

01:02.729 --> 01:04.063
Nothing upstairs.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.015
Ready?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.057
Edgar Janssen. 28th of the 12th, '59.

03:18.824 --> 03:19.825
And the keys?

03:46.602 --> 03:47.686
We are gone.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.939
Anyone trying to follow us,
anyone trying to stop us,

03:50.939 --> 03:53.692
and people start dying. Okay?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.613
Just nod if you understand.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.550
They're on the move. Over.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.762
Direction of travel is west-northwest.
That's the A41.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.348
We've hacked the GPS
on the 4x4. That's the red dot.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.474
Our vehicles are the blue.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.727
Local police have been made aware
and are keeping out the way.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.146
- This release--
- Staged release.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.356
It's a Home Office decision.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.858
- Thank you. We are aware of that.
- As are Number 10.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.736
The expedient thing
to do here is to comply,

04:37.736 --> 04:39.071
but comply slowly.

04:39.905 --> 04:43.158
Go along with what they want, yes,
but hope that in that time--

04:43.158 --> 04:45.244
- The plane lands.
- Exactly.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.164
Get everyone safely on the ground.
All 216 of them.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.669
I mean, we can play it slowly.
Doesn't mean they will.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.838
<i>Okay. We've got eyes on. Over.</i>

04:57.548 --> 04:59.967
<i>Okay, good. Don't get too close.</i>

05:08.851 --> 05:10.686
They know exactly where they're going.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.771
This is a preplanned route.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.774
Well, they'll know
we're tracking them, surely.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.734
That's the first thing
they'd think, right?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.528
I want an immediate all-ports warning.

05:19.528 --> 05:23.031
That's every airport, seaport and airfield
in the southern part of the UK on standby.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.869
And helicopters ready
in case they've arranged the same.

05:26.869 --> 05:27.828
We're gonna need--

05:52.436 --> 05:53.854
- Back up.
- Target stopped.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.733
Back up, back up.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.776
There's no point. They've already seen us.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.696
<i>Repeat. Target has stopped.</i>

06:02.696 --> 06:04.698
- We're stationary. We're compromised.
- Roger that.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.409
- Get the drone up, please.
- That's a go on the drone.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.412
Target one is exiting the vehicle.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.373
- Oh, shit.
- Target one is coming towards us.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.210
<i>Copy that. Stay in the vehicle.
Stay where you are.</i>

06:18.212 --> 06:20.172
Target may be armed. Please advise.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.219
Target one may be armed. Please advise.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.554
- Target is not armed.
- How do we know that?

06:27.554 --> 06:31.391
<i>The car was checked.
Target was checked. Target is not armed.</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:32.935
So what's in his pocket?

06:41.485 --> 06:42.528
What's your name?

06:42.528 --> 06:43.612
Daniel.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.658
There you go, Daniel. For you.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.828
<i>Daniel?</i>

06:52.329 --> 06:54.206
Target one is returning to his vehicle.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.836
<i>Target has left a mobile phone,
a silver mobile phone.</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:00.379
That's the phone we gave him.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.339
Drone is up.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.770
<i>I made it quite clear
to your colleagues in prison.</i>

07:16.770 --> 07:21.942
<i>I said, "Anyone stop us, anyone follow us,
and people start dying."</i>

07:21.942 --> 07:23.527
<i>That was our agreement.</i>

07:25.195 --> 07:27.239
<i>You just broke that agreement, Daniel.</i>

07:34.830 --> 07:36.331
Target's on the move again.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.091
I'm sorry about Lewis.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.553
But there's three of us
manning all the cabins.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.304
We need help.

08:35.599 --> 08:36.600
Do you hear me?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.437
Stuart!

08:40.437 --> 08:41.522
I heard ya.

08:56.662 --> 09:00.165
Hey. Is it true? One of them's gone?

09:02.251 --> 09:05.754
I mean, no one wants anyone to die,
but that's good, right?

09:46.753 --> 09:47.921
It's from Edgar.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.137
No. No way.

09:55.721 --> 09:59.516
We're just gonna have to pick one.
Pick one. Get it done.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.327
Get out.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.957
That's it.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.086
- Out.
- No.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.128
Out.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.089
No. He goes back, talks,
then we've got more problems.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.340
What are we doing?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.592
We kill a passenger--

11:16.260 --> 11:19.096
We kill a passenger,
we take a photo, send a photo.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.139
That's what they want,
so that's what we'll do.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.808
- That's what who wants?
- None of your business.

11:22.808 --> 11:25.769
Never you mind. That is what is happening.
That's what we're doing.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.187
You wanna know what we're doing?
That's what.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.857
I've got it. You kill a passenger,
you take a photo.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.191
Just gotta do it.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.068
- I got it. I hear you.
- Get it done.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.071
And this-- I mean--

11:36.780 --> 11:38.824
I mean, she--
I mean, that's a good choice.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.076
You gotta kill one passenger,

11:41.076 --> 11:42.744
so you might as well kill one of the crew,

11:42.744 --> 11:45.205
'cause, well, they're walking about,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.374
- and they're not leaving an empty seat.
- That's it.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.209
And no one would even know they're gone.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.294
That's right.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.671
Very smart. That's clever.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.465
And the belt's really clever as well,
'cause it's quiet.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.467
No one will hear a shot.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.678
No one will even know it happened.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.764
All right?

12:02.764 --> 12:03.974
Yeah.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.603
The thing is, no one has to kill anyone.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.106
'Cause you've already done it.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.776
You shot that woman.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.404
So just go to where she is,
take a picture of her

12:17.404 --> 12:19.698
and send it to whoever needs it.
And then it's done.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.743
No one else needs to die on this flight.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.912
Please, just let her go, mate.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.015
- Oh, my God.
- Go on.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.686
- Turn her around so we can see her.
- No, I-- Obviously, I can't.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.064
It was your idea, mate.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.545
Now put that on top.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.589
Make sure we can see it.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.762
Take a photo.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.349
- Oh, come on. You--
- Take a fucking photo.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.726
Go on! Get up!

13:52.749 --> 13:55.127
<i>If the car is heading for an airport,</i>

13:55.127 --> 13:57.379
it can no longer be Luton or Southampton.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.923
Nearest options
are RAF Benson near Nuffield.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.550
- Let's get units there.
- Okay.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.469
- I want--
- And an airfield at Fernhill.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.556
<i>But it's quite small,
so it seems unlikely.</i>

14:08.140 --> 14:10.309
Right. Let's definitely get units there.

14:11.185 --> 14:15.856
<i>I want armed units, special forces.
This is now our primary objective.</i>

14:18.525 --> 14:19.776
I mean, for my liking,

14:20.527 --> 14:24.406
less focus on the two people in the car,
more on the 200 in the sodding plane.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.325
Bit above our pay grade.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.878
That's the defense secretary,
saying that if we're happy leading,

14:37.878 --> 14:40.964
she doesn't want to tread on any toes.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.758
Yes, she's generous like that.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.344
Okay, Daniel,

14:46.178 --> 14:47.346
keep heading west, okay?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.641
Stay in range,
but you let the tracker do the work.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.352
Roger that.

15:03.529 --> 15:07.491
Daniel, this is just to confirm
that we understand each other.

15:08.075 --> 15:08.951
We do.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.203
<i>Yeah? That we're on the same page.</i>

15:11.203 --> 15:12.120
We are.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.914
<i>Yeah, 'cause it don't feel like that.</i>

15:14.915 --> 15:16.959
Edgar,
we're giving you exactly what you want.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.210
No, that's not true.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.921
I told you not to follow us.
I told you not to interfere.

15:20.921 --> 15:21.922
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:21.922 --> 15:25.425
I look around, and there you are
in the rearview fucking mirror.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.136
Yeah. Then we spoke. We gave you
what you wanted, and we stopped.

15:30.681 --> 15:31.890
<i>Edgar.</i>

15:36.228 --> 15:41.275
<i>If the car is stationary,
then why is your phone moving?</i>

15:42.484 --> 15:44.820
<i>I think it's time
we start getting serious.</i>

15:44.820 --> 15:47.114
'Cause otherwise
it's just gonna keep on happening.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.783
Wha--

15:58.375 --> 15:59.376
Stop the car.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.005
Stop the fucking car.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.306
Zahra, you need to see this.
This is straight from Janssen.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.694
That's an airplane toilet.

16:34.119 --> 16:37.915
And that's a KA29 boarding pass.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.710
We have a confirmed dead passenger
on KA29.

17:23.001 --> 17:26.380
Look for bills. See if her name comes up.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.382
Marsha Smith-Nelson.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.638
There's no woman lives here.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.432
She told us she did.
She said it on the phone.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.186
No. Look at it.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.438
This is his place.

17:44.189 --> 17:47.234
This is how a man lives when the
only thing he cares about is himself.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.445
I say we do one.

17:50.946 --> 17:51.947
We can't.

17:51.947 --> 17:55.158
He's the one causing all the trouble.
That's what they told us.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.244
So, we stay here.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.205
We put a gun to the family's head.

18:00.831 --> 18:01.915
That's the order.

18:38.827 --> 18:39.828
Felix Staton. Yeah?

18:40.412 --> 18:42.664
<i>Felix, you sound exhausted.</i>

18:42.664 --> 18:43.790
Sorry, who's this?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.251
<i>This is Devlin. Your source.</i>

18:46.251 --> 18:48.670
<i>And this is the big story of your career.</i>

18:49.171 --> 18:51.173
<i>I'm at the Ship's Tavern
behind Holborn Tube.</i>

18:51.757 --> 18:53.258
What, you wanna do this right now?

18:53.258 --> 18:56.053
Right now. Otherwise, it goes to the FT.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.560
Oh, my God.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.001
We're nearly home, love. Not long to go.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.046
How many more minutes until we're there?

19:32.673 --> 19:34.299
It says one hour, 37.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.052
How long is that?

19:39.555 --> 19:40.556
How long is--

19:41.598 --> 19:43.225
Well, 37. It's--

19:44.142 --> 19:46.812
It's five Paw Patrols.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.773
Imagine watching five Paw Patrols in a row

19:49.773 --> 19:51.233
without stopping,

19:51.233 --> 19:53.944
and that's how long it is
until the plane gets home.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.780
Can I watch five Paw Patrols
without stopping

19:56.780 --> 19:57.990
when we get home?

19:58.699 --> 20:01.702
You can, babe. You definitely can.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.664
You can too, okay?

20:06.540 --> 20:09.126
Yeah? Good girl.

20:12.296 --> 20:17.593
They needed to show a body.
Send a photo of a body down to the ground.

20:17.593 --> 20:18.677
Why?

20:18.677 --> 20:21.138
W-- As leverage. I don't know.
That's all it can be.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.306
Leverage for what?

20:22.306 --> 20:24.266
For whatever is going on down there.

20:24.933 --> 20:29.146
I mean, they send the picture of a body,
it proves that they mean business.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.731
Helps them get what they want.

20:30.731 --> 20:35.277
Okay. Well, they got their picture.
So, it's done, yeah? What's the problem?

20:35.277 --> 20:38.363
Well, they sent the picture
of the only dead body on the plane,

20:38.363 --> 20:40.991
- so no one had to die.
- Exactly. That's what I mean.

20:40.991 --> 20:44.661
Yeah, but what if it happens again?
What if they need another dead body?

20:47.456 --> 20:48.874
We could fake it.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.542
Or we refuse.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.668
Refuse?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.171
Well, not refuse. I mean...

20:54.171 --> 20:55.297
Go on.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.925
If it happens again...

21:00.344 --> 21:01.303
Fight?

21:01.303 --> 21:04.681
Yeah. Fight.
It's the only fucking thing we can do.

21:05.599 --> 21:09.019
It's either us or them,
and I can tell you, it's not gonna be us.

21:09.978 --> 21:10.979
All right?

21:11.563 --> 21:13.941
We don't know what's going on down there,
and neither do they.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.150
So, we just need to be ready.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.028
Ready to take this plane over,
and I'm not talking about just me.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.113
I'm talking about all of us.
The whole plane.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.032
Just in case.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.079
Hey. See if you can get in my pocket.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.248
- What?
- Quickly. Go.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.671
Where did you--

21:35.671 --> 21:38.006
First aid kit. Go on.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.221
Got it.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.979
Yeah. That's it.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.838
All under control now, yeah?

22:20.174 --> 22:21.049
Yeah.

22:24.178 --> 22:25.470
Take the pen out of your mouth.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.261
Felix.

23:48.887 --> 23:52.057
There are two companies listed
on the FTSE 100 that,

23:52.057 --> 23:53.350
in the next hour and a half,

23:53.350 --> 23:55.936
should undergo an enormous
share price collapse.

23:56.645 --> 23:59.398
Kingdom Airlines and Macmillan Doyle.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.442
That's the insurance company
that underwrites Kingdom.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.280
And you gonna tell me how?

24:07.155 --> 24:09.992
Or what, their planes just gonna start
dropping out of the sky?

24:11.702 --> 24:12.744
KA29.

24:13.620 --> 24:17.457
Due into London at 13:06.
That's the plane that's in trouble.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.586
- When you say "trouble"...
- That's the plane that's been hijacked.

24:24.006 --> 24:28.177
You broke the media blackout
on the gas companies scandal last year.

24:29.011 --> 24:30.888
- No.
- That was you.

24:30.888 --> 24:34.641
No, that was a backbencher
called Duncan Rowland.

24:34.641 --> 24:38.270
- He used Parliamentary Privilege to--
- Yes, but you fed him the information.

24:38.270 --> 24:42.191
No. I didn't.
That was a anonymous Twitter account.

24:42.191 --> 24:45.402
- What was it called? The--
- Don't pretend you don't know, Felix.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.906
You know perfectly well what it's called,
because you're the man behind it.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.033
And you only gave him that story

24:51.033 --> 24:54.161
after you'd made a good chunk of money
for yourself first.

24:56.163 --> 24:59.082
That's insider trading, Felix.

25:00.417 --> 25:04.129
You are corrupt.
Why else do you think I'd call you?

25:04.713 --> 25:06.632
It's 11:35.

25:07.382 --> 25:10.969
The market finds out about this
in the next 30 minutes,

25:10.969 --> 25:13.138
or the world finds out about you.

25:14.890 --> 25:15.724
Yes?

25:19.269 --> 25:20.479
Cheer up, Felix.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.731
This is what's known as a scoop.

25:25.817 --> 25:28.654
I think the gentleman is ready
to take his phone back now.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.597
Done.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.767
Yes. I'm sure it will work.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.435
One thing you can guarantee

26:00.435 --> 26:04.231
when shit hits the fan:
people always look out for themselves.

26:54.156 --> 26:55.157
What?

26:57.034 --> 26:58.744
I need to use the bathroom.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.335
Well, use it then.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.932
Victim confirmed
as Sheena Francis, aged 30.

28:01.932 --> 28:05.227
Australian. Living in Kensal Rise,
West London.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.896
And that's a definite ID?

28:07.896 --> 28:10.858
The tattoo in the photo we were
sent matches one in her Instagram.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.152
She just got a job as a speech therapist,
according to this.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.904
Due to start Monday.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.366
Whatever happens, are we agreed:

28:20.826 --> 28:25.080
Better to let these men go
than have any more deaths like this?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.415
Of course.

28:26.415 --> 28:27.499
Thank you.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.460
If it's one or the other.

28:31.587 --> 28:34.381
It is explicitly one or the other.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.424
From their side.

28:36.258 --> 28:38.844
But here in this room,

28:38.844 --> 28:41.930
the strategy remains the same.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.474
Comply slowly.

28:45.142 --> 28:51.940
Give the plane every chance of landing
before these individuals go anywhere.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.184
Yeah?

29:27.184 --> 29:30.896
I'm gonna be as civil
as I fucking can here.

29:31.605 --> 29:33.941
Either you clear this bullshit
out of the way,

29:33.941 --> 29:36.235
<i>or I request another photo.</i>

29:36.235 --> 29:37.528
Clear what bullshit?

29:37.528 --> 29:39.863
Don't give me that, Daniel.
You've blocked the road.

29:39.863 --> 29:43.033
- What?
- Blocked us. Delayed us on purpose.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.493
- Listen--
- Premeditated.

29:44.493 --> 29:47.829
Whatever's going on, Edgar,
we have got nothing to do with it.

29:47.829 --> 29:51.124
<i>I mean it, Daniel.
Get it sorted, or another passenger dies.</i>

29:51.124 --> 29:52.960
All right, listen to me. I can fix this.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.253
And another and then another.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.589
I'm gonna keep on going
until you get the fucking message.

29:57.589 --> 30:00.133
Edgar, we have not blocked any road.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.428
<i>How would we know which road to block?</i>

30:03.971 --> 30:05.931
Don't take me for a mug, Daniel.

30:05.931 --> 30:10.143
You blocked the road to delay us
until the plane lands.

30:11.103 --> 30:13.981
And now you pay the consequence.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.400
Please, Edgar.

30:17.234 --> 30:20.445
There is no need to kill innocent people.

30:29.705 --> 30:31.957
<i>A quick look at the financial news.</i>

30:31.957 --> 30:34.001
<i>The pound has started strongly
against the dollar</i>

30:34.001 --> 30:36.086
<i>and is slightly up against the euro.</i>

30:36.086 --> 30:38.338
<i>In the markets,
bond prices have fallen steadily</i>

30:38.338 --> 30:40.048
<i>following the recent
government announcement,</i>

30:40.048 --> 30:41.842
<i>but the FTSE 100 remains steady.</i>

30:43.302 --> 30:45.512
<i>Later, we'll be bringing you news about...</i>

30:51.727 --> 30:53.061
But first, a groundbreaking study...

30:53.061 --> 30:55.355
Check to see
if there's anything by the door.

30:56.148 --> 30:57.482
That's what I'm doing.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.401
Feel free to help out.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.399
<i>Emergency. Which service?</i>

31:39.942 --> 31:41.068
Police.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.446
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

31:45.739 --> 31:47.074
Police.

31:47.074 --> 31:48.700
<i>Hello? Can you repeat that for me?</i>

31:48.700 --> 31:50.244
<i>...warning of the inevitable,</i>

31:50.244 --> 31:52.204
<i>a potentially devastating rise
in sea levels.</i>

31:52.204 --> 31:55.874
<i>If you're in danger,
you can press 55 on your telephone.</i>

31:55.874 --> 31:57.960
<i>...that's an unprecedented rate.</i>

32:01.255 --> 32:03.215
<i>Hello?</i>

32:04.132 --> 32:06.218
<i>We'll send a unit
to the phone's registered address.</i>

32:06.885 --> 32:08.971
<i>All right.
I'm gonna call you straight back.</i>

32:10.430 --> 32:12.808
<i>Okay. I'm so sorry to cut across you</i>

32:12.808 --> 32:16.520
<i>but we're getting unconfirmed reports
just reaching us now</i>

32:16.520 --> 32:19.690
<i>of a major incident
aboard a British passenger plane.</i>

32:20.315 --> 32:22.359
<i>As I said, this is yet to be corroborated,</i>

32:22.359 --> 32:24.444
<i>but in a tweet
from journalist Felix Staton,</i>

32:24.444 --> 32:27.865
retweeted a few moments ago
by Investment Daily,

32:27.865 --> 32:31.034
<i>"Flight KA29 due in London at 13:06,</i>

32:31.034 --> 32:33.871
<i>rumored to be the subject
of a possible hijack."</i>

32:34.913 --> 32:38.041
<i>Again, that's a Kingdom Airlines flight
from Dubai to London.</i>

32:38.041 --> 32:39.376
<i>Currently over mainland Europe.</i>

32:40.210 --> 32:43.922
<i>A British airliner
thought to have over 200 people on board.</i>

33:11.950 --> 33:13.368
Something's going on.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.912
- Where?
- Look there.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.173
Who made this?

33:26.173 --> 33:27.925
Does it matter?

33:28.550 --> 33:29.968
Nobody needs to fight.

33:30.594 --> 33:32.304
It says "get ready" to fight.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.598
We might have no choice.

33:58.747 --> 33:59.873
Keep a look out.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.347
Shit.

34:16.223 --> 34:17.431
Fuck's sake.

34:57.222 --> 34:59.850
They're better off
turning round and going...

34:59.850 --> 35:02.561
<i>This has nothing to do with us.
You know better than I do</i>

35:02.561 --> 35:05.564
that none of our agencies have the ability
to set up any kind of roadblock.

35:05.564 --> 35:07.441
- I've said that.
- Not in that time frame.

35:07.441 --> 35:09.359
I've said all of that,
but he doesn't believe us.

35:09.359 --> 35:12.070
He thinks it's a delaying tactic.
He thinks it's a trap.

35:12.070 --> 35:14.531
- You need to clear the road.
- Daniel.

35:15.115 --> 35:17.534
Zahra, you saw what happened last time.

35:18.202 --> 35:19.203
There.

35:28.253 --> 35:30.088
<i>Target vehicle is moving.</i>

35:32.674 --> 35:33.759
Janssen.

35:33.759 --> 35:35.385
Where is he going?

35:39.598 --> 35:40.974
We have to turn this traffic around.

35:48.774 --> 35:50.442
They've lost their minds.

35:50.442 --> 35:51.902
Or they're desperate.

35:51.902 --> 35:54.863
Okay, let's maintain drone contact,
and let's send support vehicles

35:54.863 --> 35:57.616
across to whatever's
on the other side of that field.

36:07.376 --> 36:08.669
Car is heading northwest.

36:08.669 --> 36:11.338
Vehicle is heading northwest.
That's northwest.

36:11.338 --> 36:14.383
<i>Possible intersections with the A418.</i>

36:14.383 --> 36:18.053
If it's still an airfield
they want, it can only be Fernhill.

36:18.053 --> 36:20.097
They're heading directly for it.

36:20.097 --> 36:22.516
<i>We have special forces in place.</i>

36:22.516 --> 36:24.309
They could be there in ten minutes.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.019
Copy that. Thank you.

36:40.909 --> 36:41.910
Visuals down.

36:42.494 --> 36:44.288
<i>Repeat, visuals down.</i>

36:44.872 --> 36:46.456
Target is stationary.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.169
What are they doing?

36:50.752 --> 36:54.381
They're opening another gate.
The hell do you think they're doing?

36:54.381 --> 36:55.883
Still stationary.

37:00.888 --> 37:02.055
That's eyeball on.

37:02.055 --> 37:04.057
Target is moving again.

37:04.057 --> 37:07.227
It's still heading northwest.
All units, northwest.

37:11.607 --> 37:14.568
<i>Kingdom 2-9 is less than an hour
from our airspace.</i>

37:14.568 --> 37:16.653
Our time is gonna disappear
before we know it.

37:17.863 --> 37:19.323
Have we tried that mobile again?

37:19.323 --> 37:21.533
The one they called from
has been switched off.

37:22.659 --> 37:23.702
Right.

37:24.203 --> 37:26.788
Let's find all the mobile numbers
available on the manifest.

37:26.788 --> 37:30.125
And let's just-- Let's keep trying those.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.961
Okay, let's prepare a bubble
for when it enters our airspace.

37:33.504 --> 37:38.550
That's no civilian aircraft
within a 25-mile radius of KA29.

37:39.218 --> 37:40.719
KA29...

38:21.343 --> 38:24.263
<i>Target's rejoining the A41.</i>

38:26.932 --> 38:28.392
<i>I meant what I said, Daniel.</i>

38:28.392 --> 38:29.476
Edgar.

38:29.476 --> 38:32.229
<i>You put problems in our way,
you pay the price.</i>

38:32.229 --> 38:35.023
<i>I'm texting the plane
and requesting another photo.</i>

38:35.023 --> 38:36.859
It doesn't have to be like this.

38:36.859 --> 38:39.027
<i>That's two you've killed now.</i>

38:39.027 --> 38:41.488
<i>You can keep going all day.
It's up to you.</i>

38:41.488 --> 38:44.533
<i>Keep the phone on,
there's a photo on its way.</i>

39:06.263 --> 39:07.598
No, no.

39:13.145 --> 39:14.188
Okay. Now.

39:21.904 --> 39:24.615
Mummy, what's that?

39:26.200 --> 39:27.618
Mummy, what's that?

39:28.452 --> 39:32.080
Hey. I don't know.
It belongs to that lady.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.417
Take it.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.629
Take it!

39:38.629 --> 39:40.339
Come on. Pass it on.

39:44.176 --> 39:45.177
Take it.

39:46.887 --> 39:47.888
Oi!

39:50.891 --> 39:52.935
Give it. Hand it over.

39:52.935 --> 39:54.269
- Hand what over?
- Do it.

39:54.269 --> 39:55.270
- What?
- Now!

39:55.270 --> 39:57.773
It's here! It's here. Just take it.

40:01.235 --> 40:02.611
Who did this?

40:03.946 --> 40:05.113
Who?

40:05.822 --> 40:07.199
- This is it.
- Let's do it.

40:07.199 --> 40:08.784
- No. Wait.
- Do what?

40:08.784 --> 40:09.952
Who?

40:09.952 --> 40:10.994
What's happening?

40:20.170 --> 40:21.171
It's on.

40:22.965 --> 40:23.966
It's happening again.

40:25.342 --> 40:28.804
<i>Zahra, you gotta stop this.
Please. Can you hear me?</i>

40:28.804 --> 40:30.180
Yeah, okay, go ahead.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.099
We have to stop this, now.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.851
<i>That's not possible, Daniel.</i>

40:33.851 --> 40:36.979
Listen, you pull our people out.
Just let these guys go.

40:37.521 --> 40:38.730
We're not gonna do that.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.817
He's just told me.
They're gonna kill another one.

40:41.817 --> 40:43.944
<i>He's ordering them to kill another one.</i>

40:46.321 --> 40:48.657
What the fuck are you playing at?

40:48.657 --> 40:49.741
All of you!

40:58.834 --> 41:01.670
Oi. Not now. Sit.

41:10.888 --> 41:11.889
Who did this?

41:13.307 --> 41:14.641
Who?

41:14.641 --> 41:16.185
Face the fuck forward!

41:18.520 --> 41:19.730
Speak!

41:20.939 --> 41:22.482
Nothing is gonna happen!

41:26.153 --> 41:27.237
Who did it?

41:29.573 --> 41:30.824
I know who did it.

41:33.744 --> 41:36.121
The pen. Where is it?

41:37.956 --> 41:39.249
I don't have it.

41:43.295 --> 41:44.338
Read that.

41:45.339 --> 41:48.342
Out loud. For everyone!

41:50.594 --> 41:53.847
"Five minutes. New photo."

41:58.727 --> 41:59.728
Go on.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.234
"New body."

42:08.153 --> 42:09.488
Up!

42:09.488 --> 42:12.032
Belt off! Get the fuck up!

42:13.825 --> 42:14.826
It wasn't him.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.539
- He didn't write it.
- Keep out of it.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.208
- He didn't do it. He didn't write it.
- Sit the fuck down!

42:21.208 --> 42:23.794
Look! I did. It was my idea.

42:25.170 --> 42:28.966
You wanna shoot someone?
You want a new body? Shoot me.

42:29.716 --> 42:32.261
- Target vehicles. Two minutes out.
- Copy that.

42:34.346 --> 42:36.139
<i>Small one acknowledged.</i>

42:36.139 --> 42:39.017
<i>Looks like the plane is
getting ready to move. Stand by.</i>

42:39.768 --> 42:40.978
<i>Standing by.</i>

42:41.603 --> 42:43.230
No eyes on the target vehicle.

42:44.314 --> 42:45.315
<i>Copy.</i>

42:51.196 --> 42:53.949
There's a plane waiting at Fernhill,
and it's been chartered legitimately.

42:53.949 --> 42:55.617
There's no suggestion
the pilot's in on it,

42:55.617 --> 42:57.536
or even knows who his passengers are.

42:57.536 --> 43:00.706
The plane has the ability to reach
North Africa, which is important.

43:00.706 --> 43:01.874
Why?

43:01.874 --> 43:04.334
Because we lack extradition agreements
for many of those countries.

43:04.334 --> 43:07.588
They won't be going to these countries,
because they won't be taking off.

43:07.588 --> 43:09.006
You're not serious.

43:09.006 --> 43:11.091
This goes back
to what I said at the start.

43:11.091 --> 43:15.053
- We do not negotiate with--
- The plan was to comply slowly.

43:15.053 --> 43:17.431
And we did. But that was then.

43:17.431 --> 43:20.893
These are two of the highest profile
criminals in this country.

43:20.893 --> 43:23.896
- They don't just get to leave.
- They can do what they want.

43:23.896 --> 43:25.856
This is a Home Office matter.

43:25.856 --> 43:29.860
- And that is the Home Office decision!
- They are killing innocent people!

43:29.860 --> 43:31.278
We should clear the room. Give you both--

43:31.278 --> 43:33.530
What part of that are you not getting?

43:33.530 --> 43:35.949
They've shot one. Murdered one.

43:35.949 --> 43:39.161
There she is. You've seen her,
on the wall beside you, smiling,

43:39.161 --> 43:41.121
starting her new job on Monday.

43:41.121 --> 43:42.581
If you can be bothered to turn.

43:45.959 --> 43:47.878
And they're about to do it again.

43:49.463 --> 43:50.631
Do it.

43:51.798 --> 43:54.384
Edgar asks, Edgar gets. Remember?

43:57.095 --> 43:58.555
Stuart, do you hear me?

43:58.555 --> 44:01.391
Please. Come on. He helped you.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.353
He helped your brother when he was dying.

44:04.353 --> 44:06.271
He tried to save Lewis's life.

44:08.232 --> 44:09.441
Do it!

44:10.484 --> 44:11.860
Go on, then.

44:12.736 --> 44:15.155
- If not him, who?
- Stuart.

44:15.155 --> 44:17.324
Who wants it? Who?

44:18.450 --> 44:19.660
You?

44:21.620 --> 44:24.206
Who's it gonna be? You?

44:25.165 --> 44:26.500
Someone's gotta go!

44:28.293 --> 44:30.879
<i>Vehicles should be in sight now.
Confirm you have eyes on.</i>

44:31.505 --> 44:33.257
Vehicle approaching from the east.

44:33.257 --> 44:35.801
<i>Acknowledged. Eyes on the target vehicle.</i>

44:35.801 --> 44:37.010
Six shots. Let's go!

44:37.010 --> 44:39.638
- That's them.
- Copy that.

44:41.306 --> 44:44.017
Shit. Zahra,
you're gonna want to look at this.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.228
<i>...is that a British passenger plane,</i>

44:46.228 --> 44:48.272
<i>KA29, from Dubai to London...</i>

44:48.272 --> 44:51.358
I'm sorry. What the f--
What the fuck is going on?

44:51.358 --> 44:53.694
<i>...appears to have been hijacked. As I say...</i>

44:54.278 --> 44:55.487
How the fuck--

44:55.487 --> 44:57.781
You've made your objections clear,
and that's all on the record,

44:57.781 --> 44:59.408
- so should you have--
- We need to stop this.

44:59.408 --> 45:00.909
It's the home secretary.
That's the highest form

45:00.909 --> 45:02.703
- of civilian authorization--
- We still need to stop it.

45:02.703 --> 45:05.330
With respect, Louise,
the only person who can stop this is you.

45:06.331 --> 45:08.542
I need a body!

45:08.542 --> 45:12.754
That's the order,
so that's what has to happen!

45:13.255 --> 45:16.258
Either you choose, or I choose for you!

45:17.342 --> 45:18.677
Don't bother me!

45:19.386 --> 45:21.346
<i>Two targets stepping out of vehicle.</i>

45:22.890 --> 45:24.641
The detective was right. Pull them out.

45:25.934 --> 45:28.103
- Out!
- It's already started.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.188
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

45:33.483 --> 45:35.485
Go, go, go! Get down!

45:36.320 --> 45:39.656
Get down! Get down, I said! Get down!

45:41.575 --> 45:43.911
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

45:44.620 --> 45:47.164
<i>Get down! Get him down! Get him down!</i>

45:48.165 --> 45:49.583
<i>Stop resisting.</i>

45:51.126 --> 45:52.586
Well done, everyone.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.422
Get on your knees!

45:55.422 --> 45:56.381
Great job.

45:56.381 --> 45:57.674
<i>Two suspects detained.</i>

45:57.674 --> 45:59.426
- Stand by for the ID.
- Put your head down!

45:59.426 --> 46:01.970
That's not him. That's not Janssen.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.223
That's a negative ID on the target.

46:04.223 --> 46:06.433
- Negative ID. I repeat...
- It's not them.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.601
<i>...Negative ID.</i>

46:07.601 --> 46:09.686
Where are they?

46:32.209 --> 46:33.126
Let's go.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.593
Okay. Let's make this easier.

46:42.469 --> 46:44.304
If no one's gonna volunteer,

46:45.597 --> 46:48.684
the next person to make a noise gets it.

46:56.650 --> 46:57.609
Well?

47:11.665 --> 47:12.708
Thank you!

47:12.708 --> 47:13.959
Pass the scissors.

47:20.382 --> 47:21.800
Which one was it?

47:26.847 --> 47:28.473
It was me.

47:31.018 --> 47:32.519
- All right. Come here.
- No!

47:33.979 --> 47:35.063
Come here!

47:36.106 --> 47:37.316
Please!

47:40.485 --> 47:41.695
Don't look at me!

47:44.198 --> 47:45.407
Close your eyes!

47:48.493 --> 47:50.245
You chose it!

48:00.881 --> 48:01.715
Sit the fuck down!

48:06.720 --> 48:07.804
Face forward!

48:46.301 --> 48:49.555
Shut up! Stay down! Face forward!

48:50.347 --> 48:51.765
Keep still! Shut up!

48:55.602 --> 48:58.313
- Somebody fucking help me!
- Somebody needs to help him!

48:58.313 --> 48:59.356
Fucking help me!
