WEBVTT

00:03.517 --> 00:04.740
ARCHER: Oh, come on, how long

00:04.781 --> 00:06.491
are you guys gonna stay mad at
me?

00:07.483 --> 00:09.734
CYRIL: What, for getting us
all arrested for smuggling

00:09.736 --> 00:12.119
cocaine <i>into</i> Colombia?
RAY: Probably the rest

00:12.121 --> 00:14.405
of our damn lives.
CYRIL: Well, shouldn't be

00:14.407 --> 00:17.158
very long, since we're headed to
La Culebra, the most dangerous

00:17.160 --> 00:19.160
prison in South America.
(chuckles)

00:19.162 --> 00:21.162
ARCHER: Well, Cyril, when we
get there and I join the

00:21.164 --> 00:23.631
toughest gang, don't hold your
breath for a bid.

00:23.633 --> 00:26.033
RAY: A bid?
CYRIL: They're prison gangs,

00:26.035 --> 00:28.052
not frats!
ARCHER: And don't call a

00:28.054 --> 00:30.588
fraternity a frat!
COP: <i>Â¡Callate!</i>

00:30.590 --> 00:32.807
<i>(Archer grunts, groans)</i>
<i>(cops laughing)</i>

00:32.809 --> 00:35.593
<i>ARCHER: No, I'm fine.</i>
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

00:35.595 --> 00:37.928
<i>COP: And don't worry about</i>
<i>La Culebra, gringos.</i>

00:37.930 --> 00:40.097
<i>You are not going there.</i>
<i>CYRIL: Oh, well, that's good.</i>

00:40.099 --> 00:42.549
<i>Is that good?</i>
<i>It doesn't sound very good.</i>

00:42.551 --> 00:44.568
<i>Why does that sound really,</i>
<i>really, really bad?</i>

00:44.570 --> 00:46.720
<i>ARCHER (sighs): Because</i>
<i>they're gonna kill us.</i>

00:46.722 --> 00:49.056
<i>CYRIL: What?!</i>
<i>(cops laughing)</i>

00:49.058 --> 00:53.194
<i>COP: Unless you got maybe</i>
<i>$100,000 U.S. on you.</i>

00:53.196 --> 00:55.913
<i>ARCHER: Well, not on</i> me,
on me, but...

00:55.915 --> 00:57.915
(cops guffawing)
CYRIL: Hey, but when we're

00:57.917 --> 00:59.917
digging out own graves, they're
gonna get cocky, and then we

00:59.919 --> 01:01.869
whang 'em with our shovels,
right?

01:01.871 --> 01:04.038
ARCHER: Cyril, this isn't an
episode of <i>B.J. and the Bear.</i>

01:04.040 --> 01:06.040
<i>RAY: That was?</i>
<i>ARCHER: It's the jungle--</i>

01:06.042 --> 01:08.709
<i>nobody digs graves; they just</i>
<i>kneel you down by a ditch and</i>

01:08.711 --> 01:11.045
<i>put a bullet in your...</i>
<i>CYRIL: Cow!</i>

01:11.047 --> 01:15.049
<i>ARCHER: Why would they shoot</i>
<i>your... cow!</i>

01:15.051 --> 01:18.719
<i>(yelling, grunting, gasping)</i>

01:18.721 --> 01:33.367
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

01:33.369 --> 01:41.108
<i>ARCHER: God...</i>
<i>(crashing)</i>

01:41.110 --> 01:53.921
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

01:53.923 --> 01:57.675
<i>ARCHER: ...damn.</i>

01:57.677 --> 02:02.980
<i>(Archer groaning, chuckling)</i>
<i>ARCHER: Well, now I'm almost</i>

02:02.982 --> 02:04.982
<i>afraid to say any--</i>

02:04.984 --> 02:10.471
<i>(Archer groans)</i>
<i>Eat a dick, jungle.</i>

02:48.032 --> 02:49.961
CYRIL: Easy, easy.
Careful!

02:50.201 --> 02:52.397
ARCHER: Cyril, for the love
of Christ, man!

02:52.517 --> 02:54.717
CYRIL: Sorry.
ARCHER: You have to shut up.

02:54.719 --> 02:56.719
CYRIL: I am.
Starting now.

02:56.721 --> 02:58.721
Starting... now.
ARCHER: Cyril...

02:58.723 --> 03:00.723
CYRIL: Sorry. (gasps)
(animal growls in distance)

03:00.725 --> 03:02.725
What was that?
ARCHER: Probably a jaguar

03:02.727 --> 03:05.811
excited about being magnificent
and crepuscular.

03:05.813 --> 03:09.398
But I need you to focus on me,
because if, by some miracle, I

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
get the keys...
(Cyril gasps)

03:11.402 --> 03:15.237
...and then, by some other even
bigger miracle, get us out of

03:15.239 --> 03:17.790
these cuffs...
(Cyril sneezes)

03:17.792 --> 03:20.492
I am gonna beat the shit out of
you, Cyril!

03:20.494 --> 03:22.494
RAY: I'm gonna beat the
shit of both of y'all.

03:22.496 --> 03:24.547
CYRIL: Oh, my God, Ray!
ARCHER: You're alive?!

03:24.549 --> 03:26.549
RAY: What, did y'all
think I was dead?

03:26.551 --> 03:28.551
CYRIL: Well, I just assumed.
ARCHER: Yeah, I totally did.

03:28.553 --> 03:30.719
RAY: And you didn't
even take a moment?!

03:30.721 --> 03:32.721
ARCHER: I mean...
RAY: Oh, screw you guys!

03:32.723 --> 03:34.423
ARCHER: W-Wait.
What is in your mouth?

03:34.425 --> 03:36.425
GILLETTE (muffled): Nothing.
ARCHER: It's the keys!

03:36.427 --> 03:38.427
CYRIL: He's eating the keys?
ARCHER: Ray, don't you eat

03:38.429 --> 03:40.145
those keys!
RAY: I'm not eating the

03:40.147 --> 03:41.647
goddamn keys.
CYRIL: Waagh!

03:41.649 --> 03:43.349
RAY: Ow!
CYRIL: What are you doing

03:43.351 --> 03:44.850
down there?
RAY: What do you think

03:44.852 --> 03:46.551
I'm doing?
(chain rattles)

03:46.553 --> 03:48.720
CYRIL: Oh. (chuckles) sorry.
ARCHER: Do me! Do me, do me,

03:48.722 --> 03:51.440
do me, do me, do me! Ray, do me!
RAY: Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:51.442 --> 03:54.526
ARCHER: Sorry. Do <i>me,</i> please.
RAY: First, promise you

03:54.528 --> 03:56.612
won't ad at me.
ARCHER: I... Wait.

03:56.614 --> 03:58.614
Why would I be mad at you?
RAY: Because you're an

03:58.616 --> 04:01.584
asshole!
MALORY: I beg your pardon?!

04:01.586 --> 04:04.420
LANA: Since Cyril's not here,
I'm helping Cherlene redline her

04:04.422 --> 04:06.589
record contract, and I think we
should move on.

04:06.591 --> 04:08.674
They're not gonna let you
kill a guy.

04:08.676 --> 04:10.676
CHERLENE: What about a dwarf?
MALORY: What about Sterling?!

04:10.678 --> 04:12.678
CHERLENE: Wait, he's a dwarf
now?

04:12.680 --> 04:15.214
MALORY: He's missing!
With God knows how much of our

04:15.216 --> 04:18.416
dwindling cocaine, and no one's
doing anything to find him!

04:18.418 --> 04:21.086
LANA: If he calls here, my
plan, in its entirety, is to ask

04:21.088 --> 04:23.088
him where he is.
PAM: It has a simple

04:23.090 --> 04:25.090
elegance.
MALORY: Well, have you tried

04:25.092 --> 04:26.558
calling <i>him?</i>
<i>(auto-dial beeping)</i>

04:26.560 --> 04:27.810
<i>MALLORY: What?</i>
<i>(techno music playing)</i>

04:27.812 --> 04:29.361
<i>PAM: Yaaaayyyyy!</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Wooooooooo!</i>

04:29.363 --> 04:31.530
<i>FEMALE VOICE: The mailbox</i>
<i>of...</i>

04:31.532 --> 04:33.598
<i>ARCHER: ...Ar-Ar-Archer...</i>
<i>FEMALE VOICE: ...is full.</i>

04:33.600 --> 04:35.451
<i>Leave it.</i>
<i>MALLORY: All right!</i>

04:35.453 --> 04:37.269
<i>Turn it off! Turn it off!</i>
<i>(voicemail message repeating)</i>

04:37.271 --> 04:39.154
<i>LANA: I can't! It's...</i>
<i>ARCHER: Ar-Ar-Archer. Archer.</i>

04:39.156 --> 04:40.706
<i>KRIEGER: Rrgh! Rrgh! Rrgh!</i>
<i>ARCHER: (voice slows):</i>

04:40.708 --> 04:42.541
<i>Archer... Archer...</i>
<i>PAM & CHERLENE: Aw.</i>

04:42.543 --> 04:44.710
<i>KRIEGER: Okay, so he forwards</i>
<i>his phone here.</i>

04:44.712 --> 04:46.829
<i>That's easy.</i>
<i>Then he taps the phone line into</i>

04:46.831 --> 04:49.214
<i>the intercom.</i>
<i>They're both low-voltage.</i>

04:49.216 --> 04:52.284
<i>No big deal, but that's patched</i>
<i>into the actual house wiring,</i>

04:52.286 --> 04:55.638
<i>obviously one-ten AC, which</i>
<i>means he must have wired a</i>

04:55.640 --> 04:58.123
<i>transformer in the circuit</i>
<i>somewhere, but he's got all</i>

04:58.125 --> 05:00.342
<i>these fake wires in here that</i>
<i>don't connect to any...</i>

05:00.344 --> 05:03.095
<i>(Malory sobs)</i>
<i>MALORY: Is this all just a</i>

05:03.097 --> 05:07.349
<i>game to you people?!</i>
<i>My God, I'm broke, my husband</i>

05:07.351 --> 05:10.653
<i>kicked me out of my own home,</i>
<i>we're running out of cocaine,</i>

05:10.655 --> 05:13.739
<i>and on top of all that, my son</i>
<i>is missing!</i>

05:13.741 --> 05:16.241
<i>LANA: Um, okay, if Archer</i>
<i>calls, I'll...</i>

05:16.243 --> 05:18.577
<i>MALORY: No, please don't</i>
<i>disturb me.</i>

05:18.579 --> 05:21.080
<i>I think I'm getting a migraine.</i>
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

05:21.082 --> 05:23.415
<i>CHERLENE: Outlaw country!</i>
<i>Wooooooooooooooo!</i>

05:23.417 --> 05:27.086
<i>MALORY: I honestly don't know</i>
<i>how much more I can take!</i>

05:27.088 --> 05:30.489
<i>(Cherlene chuckles)</i>
<i>LANA: Wow. I think she</i>

05:30.491 --> 05:33.825
<i>seriously might be, like,</i>
<i>nearing the end of her rope.</i>

05:33.827 --> 05:37.429
<i>PAM: Hey, speaking of rope...</i>
<i>LANA: You want cocaine?</i>

05:37.431 --> 05:39.765
<i>PAM: Yay!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Goddamn it!</i>

05:39.767 --> 05:42.267
<i>RAY: How is this my</i>
<i>fault?</i>

05:42.269 --> 05:44.603
<i>ARCHER: Because why do you</i>
<i>always get paralyzed?!</i>

05:44.605 --> 05:47.172
<i>RAY: Because why do you</i>
<i>always crash every goddamn</i>

05:47.174 --> 05:49.508
<i>vehicle I get in?!</i>
<i>ARCHER: I didn't crash it!</i>

05:49.510 --> 05:51.810
<i>That crooked idiot, drunk</i>
<i>murdering cop did!</i>

05:51.812 --> 05:54.279
<i>CYRIL: Uh, yeah, speaking</i>
<i>of, these guys don't look too</i>

05:54.281 --> 05:56.615
<i>good.</i>
<i>(cop coughs very weakly)</i>

05:56.617 --> 05:58.617
<i>ARCHER: Well, they're gonna</i>
<i>look even worse when they're</i>

05:58.619 --> 06:00.736
<i>jaguar poop!</i>
<i>CYRIL: What? We can't just</i>

06:00.738 --> 06:03.122
<i>leave them here.</i>
<i>ARCHER: As opposed to what,</i>

06:03.124 --> 06:05.290
<i>Cyril?!</i>
<i>You and I sling them over our</i>

06:05.292 --> 06:07.292
<i>shoulders and climb 200 feet</i>
<i>straight up a cliff without</i>

06:07.294 --> 06:09.628
<i>a goddamn rope?!</i>
<i>CYRIL: I...</i>

06:09.630 --> 06:11.630
<i>RAY: Wait. Where am I in</i>
<i>that scenario?!</i>

06:11.632 --> 06:13.632
<i>ARCHER: I guess getting</i>
<i>pooped out of a jaguar!</i>

06:13.634 --> 06:15.634
<i>CYRIL: Well, we definitely</i>
<i>can't leave Ray!</i>

06:15.636 --> 06:17.636
<i>ARCHER: We have to!</i>
<i>Ray, I'm sorry.</i>

06:17.638 --> 06:19.638
<i>RAY: No, you're not!</i>
<i>ARCHER: I am, actually,</i>

06:19.640 --> 06:21.757
<i>which, whatever, but...</i>
<i>(gun cocks)</i>

06:21.759 --> 06:24.143
<i>CYRIL: We are not leaving</i>
<i>Ray!</i>

06:24.145 --> 06:26.311
<i>ARCHER: What do you even</i>
<i>think you're doing?</i>

06:26.313 --> 06:31.716
<i>CYRIL: I am taking command!</i>
<i>(Archer and Cyril laugh)</i>

06:31.718 --> 06:35.270
<i>CYRIL: Hey, I'm serious!</i>
<i>ARCHER: Oh, my God.</i>

06:35.272 --> 06:37.606
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Oh, that's really funny.</i>

06:37.608 --> 06:40.159
<i>Thanks, Cyril.</i>
<i>I-I think we needed that.</i>

06:40.161 --> 06:42.494
<i>RAY: We did.</i>
<i>We really did.</i>

06:42.496 --> 06:45.781
<i>ARCHER: Oh, man.</i>
<i>Now give me the goddamn weapon.</i>

06:45.783 --> 06:48.333
<i>ARCHER: You nut!</i>
<i>(Cyril laughs)</i>

06:48.335 --> 06:50.669
<i>CYRIL: Thought you were gonna</i>
<i>hit me with it.</i>

06:50.671 --> 06:53.338
<i>ARCHER: I was.</i>
<i>Okay, so how do we get Ray and</i>

06:53.340 --> 06:55.574
<i>his useless legs out of here?</i>
<i>RAY: Well, now, I</i>

06:55.576 --> 06:58.093
<i>actually have some thoughts on</i>
<i>that.</i>

06:58.095 --> 07:01.463
<i>ARCHER (sighing): Goddamn it.</i>
<i>RAY: I think it's a</i>

07:01.465 --> 07:04.433
<i>pretty good plan, y'all.</i>
<i>ARCHER: No, it isn't!</i>

07:04.435 --> 07:07.752
<i>We might as well slather</i>
<i>ourselves with whatever it is</i>

07:07.754 --> 07:11.440
<i>crocodiles eat, and swim down!</i>
<i>CYRIL: What do crocodiles</i>

07:11.442 --> 07:13.725
<i>eat?</i>
<i>ARCHER: Everything!</i>

07:13.727 --> 07:19.231
<i>They eat everything!</i>
<i>And fear is their bacon bits.</i>

07:25.013 --> 07:27.406
CHERLENE: I don't understand
what you're saying.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.497
LANA: Damn it!
Look, I think Malory is

07:29.595 --> 07:32.115
genuinely going through a really
hard time right now, so I think

07:32.117 --> 07:34.484
we should do something nice for
her.

07:34.486 --> 07:36.653
CHERLENE: I don't understand
what you're say...

07:36.655 --> 07:38.822
LANA: Goddamn it!
PAM: I'm with you, Lana.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.991
It freaked me out seeing her cry
like that.

07:40.993 --> 07:44.027
It was like seeing my dad cry.
LANA: Crying because...?

07:44.029 --> 07:46.997
PAM: (splutters) Name it.
He's a gigantic pussy.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.933
Oh, my God, when my mom died?
Hey, and speaking of pussies...

07:49.935 --> 07:52.436
LANA: A Long Island Iced Tea?
I'm not even supposed to drink

07:52.438 --> 07:54.771
regular iced tea.
PAM: Yeah, this is a Long

07:54.773 --> 07:57.074
Island.
CHERLENE: Yeah, stupid!

07:57.076 --> 07:59.609
Your words.
LANA: Shut up!

07:59.611 --> 08:01.778
And, okay, so what would cheer
Malory up?

08:01.780 --> 08:03.947
What does she like?
PAM: Archer and money and

08:03.949 --> 08:06.450
liquor.
LANA: Besides that.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.719
CHERLENE: Some different
liquor.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.654
PAM: You know what always
cheers me up...

08:10.656 --> 08:12.789
LANA: We're not giving her
cocaine.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.092
PAM: I was gonna say cock.
CHERLENE: Yeah, stup... Ow!

08:15.094 --> 08:17.627
LANA: You done?
CHERLENE: I am. Thank you.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.963
LANA: Ass. And Pam, that's
not a bad idea.

08:19.965 --> 08:22.466
PAM: Hmm. I don't know if I'd
be comfortable with that.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.801
I mean, even for me, it's...
LANA: Let me stop you before

08:24.803 --> 08:28.472
you say what it is you think I'm
talking about.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.640
PAM: Getting shitty drunk on
two different kinds of liquor,

08:30.642 --> 08:32.943
dressing up like Mr. Archer,
and banging the old lady with

08:32.945 --> 08:35.479
a strap...
Ow!

08:35.481 --> 08:37.647
LANA: That's not what I had
in mind.

08:37.649 --> 08:39.649
PAM: Okay, good, 'cause the
the dressing up like Mr. Archer

08:39.650 --> 08:41.985
part makes it kind of weird.
LANA: I...

08:41.986 --> 08:44.388
PAM: I'd have to be super
drunk, like so drunk I bet I

08:44.390 --> 08:47.424
wouldn't even enjoy...! Ow!
(Pam clears her throat)

08:47.426 --> 08:51.528
Okay, so what's <i>your</i> plan?
CYRIL: Well, eventually, we

08:51.530 --> 08:53.580
have to come to a village or
whatever, and maybe we can

08:53.582 --> 08:55.749
barter with them for a ride,
or...

08:55.751 --> 08:58.051
ARCHER: Barter with what,
Cyril?

08:58.053 --> 09:00.053
CYRIL: I don't know.
Maybe the gun, or...

09:00.055 --> 09:02.422
ARCHER (laughing): Yes!
Great idea, yeah, Cyril.

09:02.424 --> 09:04.758
Let's give an M-16 to a bunch of
wild Indians!

09:04.760 --> 09:06.927
CYRIL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
RAY: Goddamn,

09:06.929 --> 09:09.062
Huckleberry Finn!
ARCHER: What?! I don't think

09:09.064 --> 09:11.064
it's racist to assume that a
previously uncontacted tribe of

09:11.066 --> 09:14.985
indigenous peoples might react
unpredictably, perhaps even

09:14.987 --> 09:18.855
wildly, to a bunch of white guys
who walk up and hand 'em a

09:18.857 --> 09:21.358
goddamn M-16!
CYRIL: Oh, okay.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.360
I didn't know in your scenario
the indigenous people were

09:23.362 --> 09:25.529
uncontacted.
RAY: Totally different

09:25.531 --> 09:27.697
scenario.
CYRIL: In which, no, you

09:27.699 --> 09:29.866
obviously wouldn't just want to
hand them an M-16.

09:29.868 --> 09:32.035
RAY: 'Cause they'd be,
like, "What?!"

09:32.037 --> 09:35.539
Or whatever their word for that
is.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.874
MALORY: What?
LANA: A spa day!

09:37.876 --> 09:40.377
MALORY: What? No.
I can't go out like this.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.712
LANA: No, no, no!
That's the best part.

09:42.714 --> 09:44.881
It's here!
MALORY: Then it's not a spa

09:44.883 --> 09:47.050
day.
It's just a bath!

09:47.052 --> 09:49.052
I want to go back to sleep!
LANA: Well, after this,

09:49.054 --> 09:51.388
you'll be so relaxed.
MALORY: I took three Valium!

09:51.390 --> 09:53.557
If I get any more relaxed,
I will literally die.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.443
LANA: Okay, well, that's also
good... because you may not

09:56.445 --> 09:59.563
actually find this to be all
that relaxing.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.898
MALORY: What the...?
Why are they dressed like that?

10:01.900 --> 10:04.401
LANA (sighing): That was the
only way they'd do it.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.654
CHERLENE: Strip!
PAM: Yay!

10:07.656 --> 10:11.124
CYRIL: Wait. What?
ARCHER: <i>Crocodylus acutus!</i>

10:11.126 --> 10:13.660
<i>And maybe even...</i>
<i>Are we in the Orinoco drainage</i>

10:13.662 --> 10:15.962
<i>basin?</i>
<i>CYRIL: How should I know?</i>

10:15.964 --> 10:18.498
<i>ARCHER: Okay, so maybe</i>
<i>Crocodylus intermedius</i> is in

10:18.500 --> 10:21.001
play!
Not to mention four kinds of

10:21.003 --> 10:23.503
caiman, including the Black
Caiman, which can grow up to

10:23.505 --> 10:25.839
22 feet!
RAY: Is that why you're

10:25.841 --> 10:28.141
up on those goddamn cans?
ARCHER: Yeah, if a big bull

10:28.143 --> 10:30.677
croc slithers up on the raft,
I'm gonna pour a ring of gas

10:30.679 --> 10:33.013
around me and set it on fire.
CYRIL: Why...?

10:33.015 --> 10:35.515
ARCHER: Cyril, they can't
chomp through fire.

10:35.517 --> 10:37.851
Although, I have no reason to
think that.

10:37.853 --> 10:40.153
CYRIL: Why are you so scared
of crocodiles?

10:40.155 --> 10:42.689
ARCHER: Gee, I don't know,
Cyril.

10:42.691 --> 10:45.025
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of
any apex predator that lived

10:45.027 --> 10:47.477
through the K-T extinction.
CYRIL: The...?

10:47.479 --> 10:49.812
ARCHER: Physically unchanged
for 100 million years, because

10:49.814 --> 10:52.115
it's the perfect killing
machine-- a half-ton of

10:52.117 --> 10:56.119
cold-blooded fury, with a bite
force of 20,000 Newtons, and

10:56.121 --> 10:58.988
stomach acid so strong, it can
dissolve bones and hooves.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.491
And now we're surrounded, those
snake-eyes are watching from the

11:01.493 --> 11:04.994
shadows, waiting for the night.
RAY: âª Waiting

11:04.996 --> 11:07.497
For the night! âª
ARCHER: Damn it, Ray!

11:07.499 --> 11:09.832
RAY: âª Ooh-hoo!
ARCHER: Keep your voice down!

11:09.834 --> 11:12.135
RAY: Why?!
Crocodiles don't have ears!

11:12.137 --> 11:14.504
ARCHER: They absolutely have
ears, shit head!

11:14.506 --> 11:16.506
RAY: Well, so do I, and
you just talked yourself out of

11:16.508 --> 11:19.109
a hat!
(all yelling)

11:19.111 --> 11:21.611
CYRIL: Jeezy Pete's!
ARCHER: Way to go, Ray.

11:21.613 --> 11:23.947
Now he's got a taste for...
(yelling)

11:23.949 --> 11:26.449
RAY: Oh, my God!
CYRIL: Shoot it! Shoot it!

11:26.451 --> 11:28.785
Shoot it!
ARCHER: Uh, I can't!

11:28.787 --> 11:31.020
RAY: Sweet Jesus God,
then at least shoot out my eyes

11:31.022 --> 11:33.523
so I don't have to see!
(yelling)

11:33.525 --> 11:36.693
Oh, my God!
CYRIL: What is happening?

11:36.695 --> 11:38.995
(yelling)
Oh, God!

11:38.997 --> 11:41.498
RAY: Oh, boy.
(groaning and crying)

11:41.500 --> 11:43.833
No.
(Archer groans)

11:43.835 --> 11:48.722
(Gillette and Cyril crying)
(growling)

11:48.724 --> 11:50.890
ARCHER: Huh.
(Cyril and Gillette whimpering)

11:50.892 --> 11:53.059
I thought that was gonna be way
more... epic-fireball-y.

11:53.061 --> 11:55.395
(Gillette whimpers)
CYRIL: Wuh-wuh, wuh-wuh,

11:55.397 --> 11:57.564
wuh-wuh...
ARCHER: Come, Cyril.

11:57.566 --> 11:59.733
Pick one.
Either have a stroke, or spit it

11:59.735 --> 12:02.018
out.
CYRIL: W-w-were you g-g-gonna

12:02.020 --> 12:04.521
say, "A taste for human flesh?"
ARCHER: No, I was gonna say,

12:04.523 --> 12:06.856
"Hat," but now it's not funny.
Well, not as funny.

12:06.858 --> 12:09.159
RAY: It's all your
fault.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.695
It's all your fault.
ARCHER: Which part, Ray?!

12:11.697 --> 12:14.030
The part where I flipped our
jeep down a cliff about 90

12:14.032 --> 12:17.667
goddamn times, because I got
drunk to cope with the fact I

12:17.669 --> 12:19.953
was about to murder us in the
jungle?!

12:19.955 --> 12:22.672
RAY: Well, it-it... it's
your fault we're in this stupid

12:22.674 --> 12:25.008
jungle in the first place!
ARCHER: Well, if we're gonna

12:25.010 --> 12:28.094
go back to the beginning of
time, Mother's the one who got

12:28.096 --> 12:30.764
us arrested for treason, and
then bought a ton of goddamn

12:30.766 --> 12:33.099
cocaine!
CYRIL: I thought you b-bought

12:33.101 --> 12:35.602
it.
LANA: Wait. What?

12:35.604 --> 12:37.937
MALORY: Up! Up!
Hands off the goods, mister!

12:37.939 --> 12:40.106
PAM: Aw.
MALORY: I said that's

12:40.108 --> 12:42.609
ridiculous.
Where would I get 2,000 pounds

12:42.611 --> 12:44.944
of cocaine?
LANA: But if you didn't...

12:44.946 --> 12:47.113
Okay, so, where would Archer get
that much coke?

12:47.115 --> 12:49.566
MALORY: Well, who knows with
him?

12:49.568 --> 12:51.568
Maybe wherever he got that new
kind of VD none of the doctors

12:51.570 --> 12:53.737
had ever seen before.
LANA: Wha?! When was that?!

12:53.739 --> 12:55.905
PAM: Yeah, when was that?
CHERLENE: Seriously, was...

12:55.907 --> 12:58.408
MALORY: Trust me, if you had
it, you'd know.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.577
CHERLENE & PAM: Phew!
LANA: Ugh. I loathe knowing

13:00.579 --> 13:02.746
that I had sex with the same
person as you two.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.914
PAM: What? You had sex with
me!

13:04.916 --> 13:07.083
LANA: No, I... (gasps)
Oh, my God, that's right.

13:07.085 --> 13:09.419
MALORY: Ha!
PAM: What are you laughing

13:09.421 --> 13:11.621
at?
MALORY: Oh, my God, that's

13:11.623 --> 13:13.790
right.
ARCHER: So if you dicks want

13:13.792 --> 13:15.958
to blame somebody for our
current predicament, blame...

13:15.960 --> 13:20.847
RAY: You! I blame you!
Archer! I blame you!

13:20.849 --> 13:23.983
J'accuse!
(flames whoosh, all yelling)

13:23.985 --> 13:30.490
ARCHER: What was that, Ray?!
(whistling)

13:31.874 --> 13:35.328
(laughs): Sorry.
I genuinely couldn't hear you.

13:38.099 --> 13:41.904
(Cyril and Gillette crying)
ARCHER: Jesus, what is wrong

13:42.144 --> 13:43.505
with you two?
CYRIL: What's wrong?!

13:43.598 --> 13:46.048
What's wrong is we're about to
be on fire!

13:46.050 --> 13:48.100
RAY: Do something!
ARCHER: Uh, no?

13:48.102 --> 13:50.102
RAY: Archer!
ARCHER: Not until you

13:50.104 --> 13:52.104
apologize.
RAY: For what?!

13:52.106 --> 13:54.106
CYRIL: Ray, goddamn it, just
apologize!

13:54.108 --> 13:56.559
RAY: I... Jesus Christ,
I'm sorry!

13:56.561 --> 13:58.561
ARCHER: There, was that so
hard?

13:58.563 --> 14:01.230
Okay!
(Gillette coughing, sputtering)

14:01.232 --> 14:03.232
CYRIL: What the hell are
you... (coughing)

14:03.234 --> 14:05.618
ARCHER: Crocodile repellent!
CYRIL (coughing): What?!

14:05.620 --> 14:08.070
ARCHER: We got to swim for
it-- on three.

14:08.072 --> 14:10.740
CYRIL: No, no, n... (grunts)
Archer!

14:10.742 --> 14:13.075
ARCHER: Sorry, three!
Kick, Cyril, kick!

14:13.077 --> 14:15.694
(Cyril coughing)
(Gillette retching, coughing)

14:15.696 --> 14:18.381
It's okay, stupid, I forgive
you.

14:18.383 --> 14:20.716
RAY: F...
ARCHER: Forgive, yes.

14:20.718 --> 14:25.371
Cannonball!
Woooooo!!

14:25.373 --> 14:30.843
(Cyril retching)
(Gillette moaning)

14:30.845 --> 14:33.729
ARCHER (chuckling): Oh...
CYRIL: Oh, God, I think I

14:33.731 --> 14:35.731
swallowed a leech.
ARCHER: Well, the gas ought

14:35.733 --> 14:37.733
to kill that.
RAY: (coughs) You

14:37.735 --> 14:39.852
asshole, you could've killed us!
(Cyril clears throat)

14:39.854 --> 14:41.654
Well?!
CYRIL: Well, you did set the

14:41.656 --> 14:43.572
raft on fire.
RAY: Oh, my God, you

14:43.574 --> 14:47.443
always take his side!
CYRIL: I never, ever, ever

14:47.445 --> 14:50.579
take his side.
ARCHER: Blah, blah, blah,

14:50.581 --> 14:52.915
some joke about you two having
vaginas.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.617
Come on, let's go.
CYRIL: Go where?

14:54.619 --> 14:56.752
ARCHER: Well, long-term, I
was thinking home.

14:56.754 --> 14:59.455
Short-term, I... Here, hold
this.

14:59.457 --> 15:01.457
(grunts)
RAY: Go herd.

15:01.459 --> 15:04.093
ARCHER: Short-term, somewhere
that's not the crocodile version

15:04.095 --> 15:06.345
of a drive-through.
(crocodile snarls)

15:06.347 --> 15:08.347
CYRIL: Sounds good!
Here we go!

15:08.349 --> 15:10.349
ARCHER: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
CYRIL: I got it. (grunting)

15:10.351 --> 15:13.252
ARCHER: Cyril.
CYRIL: What if I need a gun?

15:13.254 --> 15:15.754
ARCHER: Um...
here.

15:15.756 --> 15:17.807
CYRIL: Oh, come on.
ARCHER: The only limit is

15:17.809 --> 15:22.862
your imagination.
Pyoo! Pyoo!

15:22.864 --> 15:27.099
(Cyril sighs)
PAM: Aw, look, she's almost

15:27.101 --> 15:29.735
not terrifying.
LANA: (sighs) Thanks, you

15:29.737 --> 15:31.737
guys.
I think the spa day took her

15:31.739 --> 15:35.124
mind off Archer being missing,
even if it almost got weird.

15:35.126 --> 15:37.493
CHERLENE: She made it weird.
LANA: No, you did.

15:37.495 --> 15:39.578
Nobody wants an enema.
CHERLENE: Some people...

15:39.580 --> 15:41.831
LANA: Not with yogurt.
PAM: So... you think those

15:41.833 --> 15:44.417
guys are okay?
LANA: I don't know.

15:44.419 --> 15:46.719
I mean, if it were anybody else,
I'd say no, but this is Archer

15:46.721 --> 15:50.389
we're talking about so...
probably not.

15:50.391 --> 15:52.725
CYRIL: Oh, for... Can you not
give it a rest?

15:52.727 --> 15:54.760
RAY: Not until he admits
he's been half-assing this

15:54.762 --> 15:56.762
entire cocaine debacle from
the get-go.

15:56.764 --> 15:58.764
ARCHER: That's only because I
thought it was gonna be way

15:58.766 --> 16:00.766
easier.
RAY: You think

16:00.768 --> 16:03.769
everything's gonna be easy!
ARCHER: It almost always is!

16:03.771 --> 16:06.155
RAY: Aha! See?
That's what I resent.

16:06.157 --> 16:08.491
ARCHER: What do you resent,
Ray, my muscly shoulders poking

16:08.493 --> 16:11.076
into your tum-tum?
RAY: I resent how you

16:11.078 --> 16:13.162
never take anything seriously
because you just assume

16:13.164 --> 16:15.164
everything's gonna work out for
you.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.166
ARCHER: It almost always
does!

16:17.168 --> 16:19.168
(Cyril sighs)
Case in point.

16:19.170 --> 16:22.338
CYRIL: What the...
RAY: Goddamn it.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.373
CYRIL (quietly): Hey, do you
think those guys are Doctors

16:24.375 --> 16:26.759
Without Borders?
ARCHER: Yes, Cyril, I do.

16:26.761 --> 16:29.512
I bet those assault rifles shoot
polio vaccine.

16:29.514 --> 16:32.431
They're narcos, dummy.
And that plane's probably loaded

16:32.433 --> 16:34.433
with coke.
Okay, here's the plan...

16:34.435 --> 16:36.435
CYRIL: What? Are you crazy?
RAY: You're out of your

16:36.437 --> 16:38.437
mind.
ARCHER: We have to get out of

16:38.439 --> 16:41.607
the country, so we can either
walk out-- which, no, no, we

16:41.609 --> 16:45.478
can't-- or we can fly out in an
airplane full of cocaine.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.646
CYRIL: Ray is paralyzed.
Who's gonna fly it?

16:47.648 --> 16:49.648
ARCHER: Don't... That...
Why would you worry about that

16:49.650 --> 16:51.650
before you need to?
CYRIL: What?

16:51.652 --> 16:53.702
ARCHER: Why clog your brain
with a bunch of hypothetical

16:53.704 --> 16:56.038
maybe-what-if bullshit?
CYRIL: Because...

16:56.040 --> 16:58.040
ARCHER: Shut up.
This is what we're doing.

16:58.042 --> 17:02.411
So, Cyril, lock and load that
stick.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.747
(indistinct chatter)

17:04.749 --> 17:09.251
(Gillette stifles a sneeze)

17:09.252 --> 17:18.511
ARCHER (quietly): <i>Manos arriba.</i>

17:18.512 --> 17:21.096
<i>GILLETTE (whispering): Nice.</i>
<i>ARCHER: You want to...</i>

17:21.098 --> 17:25.733
<i>RAY: Oh, right.</i>
<i>(cocks gun)</i>

17:25.736 --> 17:28.819
<i>BOSS NARCO: Bueno pues,</i>
<i>cuando estÃ¡ cargado...</i>

17:28.939 --> 17:29.985
Ray: <i> Manos...</i>

17:30.776 --> 17:34.450
Um...wait, what was it?
Archer: <i> Arriba!</i> Goddamn it.

17:34.570 --> 17:37.118
<i>Â¡Manos arriba!</i> (Weapons cocking)
Boss Narco: (Chuckles)

17:37.255 --> 17:40.611
I don't think so, gringo.
Archer: Drop your weapons! I'm serious.

17:40.731 --> 17:44.095
I will shoot this guy right in the...

17:44.229 --> 17:47.489
Boss Narco: (Laughs) What the hell is that?

17:48.159 --> 17:51.049
Archer: Pyoo! Pyoo! (Narcos laughing)

17:51.169 --> 17:56.741
Cyril: Suppressing fiiiiiire!
(Narcos shouting)

17:59.303 --> 18:02.947
Archer: Okay, okay!
(Moans) Goddamn it, Cyril!

18:03.081 --> 18:06.283
Cyril: Woooooo!! (Chuckles)
Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez! Sorry.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.306
Archer: That's why I wanted you to be stick.
Ray: Uh-uh!

18:10.678 --> 18:13.724
Archer: Yeah, come on. It's been a long day.
Boss Narco: Do you have any

18:13.859 --> 18:19.415
idea who we are?
Archer: Mmm... nope. Do you know who we are?

18:19.775 --> 18:23.834
Boss Narco: No.
Archer: Then blow me.

18:23.969 --> 18:28.039
Cyril, make sure it's good and tight.
(Archer chuckles)

18:28.173 --> 18:31.075
Why are we not still doing phrasing?
Cyril: Why are we still not

18:31.209 --> 18:34.927
worrying about who's gonna fly the damn plane?!
Archer: Oh, right.

18:35.047 --> 18:38.349
<i>Â¡Oye, pendejos!</i>
<i>Â¿QuiÃ©n es el piloto?</i> (Narcos snicker)

18:38.834 --> 18:40.969
_

18:41.403 --> 18:43.120
Cyril: Oh, you are kidding.
Archer: Okay, Ray, ballpark,

18:43.255 --> 18:47.388
- how long will it take you to teach me
how to fly a plane? Ray: What... how long?

18:47.508 --> 18:49.693
Cyril: I flew the space shuttle.
Archer: Cyril, hush.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.730
Big guys. Ray, how long...
Ray: How long will it take

18:52.864 --> 18:57.301
you, Archer, to admit you dick around every
time we're in danger just to screw with

18:57.436 --> 19:00.569
everybody because of your complete...

19:00.689 --> 19:03.755
no, your utter contempt
for your own mortality?

19:05.220 --> 19:09.680
Archer: I mean... Yeah, duh.
Ray: That's all I wanted.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.048
(Grunts)

19:13.545 --> 19:15.902
Oh, you could walk this whole time?

19:18.938 --> 19:21.684
No, Cyril, of course I'm not mad.

19:22.599 --> 19:24.570
I think what Ray did was awesome.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.261
Okay, then, well you are an idiot.

19:26.381 --> 19:27.394
Your words.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.208
Which I guess, so am I,

19:29.328 --> 19:32.063
since I just realized we can't land anywhere
with all this cocaine on board.

19:32.183 --> 19:33.815
Oh, my God, you guys,
where are we gonna land?

19:33.935 --> 19:35.987
Jesus Christ, woman, calm down.

19:36.107 --> 19:39.620
We got 5 hours of fuel.
We'll worry about that when we have to.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.590
Guess I'm rubbing off on you, Ray.

19:44.679 --> 19:46.870
- Goddammit!
- What?

19:46.990 --> 19:49.945
Why aren't we doing phrasing?

19:59.546 --> 20:09.862
