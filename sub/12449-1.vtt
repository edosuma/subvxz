Run! Come on! Run!

00:32.331 --> 00:34.133
Run, Debby!

00:34.167 --> 00:37.770
Come on, down!
Down! Down!

00:37.804 --> 00:40.139
You have to run.
Run! They're coming.

00:40.173 --> 00:43.075
Come on, Debby.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.277
Where's your fucking exit?
I'm running out of ammo.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.813
We're close!

00:46.846 --> 00:48.815
You said that
a minute ago.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.386
Fuck! There's
too many of them!

00:57.456 --> 01:00.694
Why don't they attack?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.796
Batteries not included?

01:02.828 --> 01:05.431
Heil Hitler!

01:05.464 --> 01:07.900
No.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.237
Fuck it.

01:10.734 --> 01:15.612
<b>BUNKER OF THE DEAD</b>

01:20.322 --> 01:23.322
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

01:22.815 --> 01:24.851
This suit is awesome

01:24.884 --> 01:26.819
but they'll never
let us pass with this.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.723
No prob. We'll cover
it with a jacket.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.891
-Great, man.
-Just like Clark Kent.

01:31.923 --> 01:34.461
Put some glasses on and everybody
believes your someone else.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.896
-Whoo-hoo!
-Does it fit?

01:36.928 --> 01:40.799
Yup, but this
stuff is heavy.

01:40.833 --> 01:43.036
That's the batteries
for the 3D camera and lights.

01:43.068 --> 01:46.371
Gives you power
for nearly 24 hours.

01:46.405 --> 01:48.274
Yeah. Great.
You don't have to carry it.

01:48.306 --> 01:50.476
You just got to endure
it Bruce Lee style.

01:50.509 --> 01:51.844
Wah...

01:51.878 --> 01:53.379
Come on! Come on!

01:53.411 --> 01:56.315
Come here
come on.

01:56.348 --> 01:58.752
-Come on. Like this, pussy?
-Okay. I surrender.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.953
Hey, kids.

02:00.987 --> 02:03.289
I hope that's just
cops and robbers

02:03.321 --> 02:05.090
and not what
it looks like.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.959
You want a free ride?

02:06.993 --> 02:09.529
You're gonna be
proud of your brother

02:09.561 --> 02:13.198
when I'm famous and on every vip
list of every party in town.

02:13.232 --> 02:15.401
Yeah, sure.

02:15.434 --> 02:18.071
Make me proud and let me
borrow your car tonight.

02:18.103 --> 02:22.441
My car?
Of course.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.044
Thanks a lot.
Now I'm already proud.

02:26.078 --> 02:29.015
You like what you see?

02:29.048 --> 02:33.051
-Yes.
-Cool, but there's something

02:33.085 --> 02:34.821
itchy and scratchy
on my neck.

02:34.853 --> 02:36.388
-Could you...?
-Yeah.

02:37.989 --> 02:40.192
-Where?
-More to the left.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.561
-Left. Left.
-Left?

02:41.593 --> 02:44.297
-Right.
-I don't see anything.

02:44.329 --> 02:48.267
-But I do.
-Nope. Just cloth. Nothing else.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.169
Already better.
Much better.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.839
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

02:52.871 --> 02:55.174
Well, sweethearts.
Then you two have fun

02:55.208 --> 02:56.408
with whatever
you're up to.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.510
See you later.

02:57.543 --> 03:00.079
Yeah. Bye.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.414
Jeez.
She's giving me a hard-on.

03:02.448 --> 03:06.452
She's so hot!
I need that tape.

03:06.484 --> 03:10.322
-What?
-Did you just film my sister's tits?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.490
You want a copy, too?

03:11.524 --> 03:14.027
You just filmed
my sister's tits!

03:14.060 --> 03:16.029
Chill it, man!

03:16.061 --> 03:17.297
We're in the middle
of unveiling

03:17.329 --> 03:19.298
one of the last
secrets of world war ii

03:19.331 --> 03:21.567
and you're filming
my sister's tits, man!

03:21.601 --> 03:25.972
-Man, boobs in 3D!
-Give me the camera!

03:29.608 --> 03:33.078
-Did you get a signal?
-Yeah.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.882
What's your
ugly face doing on my arm?

03:35.914 --> 03:38.283
I told you. That's the
live feed from my web cam.

03:38.317 --> 03:40.353
That's how we can
stay in contact.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.622
Cool. Let me have a look.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.258
Awesome!

03:45.291 --> 03:48.494
I can see myself on TV!

03:48.526 --> 03:50.863
Cut it out.

03:50.896 --> 03:54.167
-Fuckin' idiot!
-Can it play movies, too?

03:54.199 --> 03:57.336
Hey!
Your sister's movies?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.873
Let's go.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.507
Look, it's a little bit late.

04:01.539 --> 04:03.142
If you wanna
change your mind...

04:03.174 --> 04:05.143
What? Why?

04:05.176 --> 04:07.547
Well, I could do
some more research,

04:07.579 --> 04:09.581
-improve the suit.
-Come on!

04:09.614 --> 04:12.317
This is the thing
we've both waited for years.

04:12.351 --> 04:14.354
The big secret,
the conspiracy

04:14.387 --> 04:18.124
-the fucking gold!
-[Thomas I'm just saying...

04:18.156 --> 04:21.361
Then stop saying it!

04:21.392 --> 04:24.530
Okay. It's too late
now anyway.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.164
-What?
-The cam. Hurry.

04:26.198 --> 04:27.532
Take off your helmet. Hey!

04:27.566 --> 04:29.936
Give me... take it off!

04:32.203 --> 04:34.306
We are not the droids
your looking for.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.275
Yeah, right.
That'll make me laugh

04:36.309 --> 04:38.277
when I'm off duty.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.113
What do you two
cinderellas want?

04:40.145 --> 04:42.648
And why the hell is he dressed
like a north Korean spy?

04:42.681 --> 04:45.217
We're visiting
my dad at the shooting range

04:45.251 --> 04:48.587
and my buddy here
wants to blow off some steam.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.690
Right. Does the old man
know you're coming?

04:50.722 --> 04:53.059
Affirmative. Here.

05:00.131 --> 05:02.035
Should we call him?

05:04.102 --> 05:06.638
Nope. It's fine.

05:06.672 --> 05:08.607
Make sure you stick
to the main road.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.443
Don't stop until
you get to the shooting range.

05:10.475 --> 05:13.545
Copy that? -Stick to the
main road and don't stop.

05:13.578 --> 05:16.482
-And don't get any stupid ideas.
-Never, ever!

05:16.515 --> 05:18.717
Yup.

05:28.294 --> 05:32.265
Say, the permit,
was it real?

05:32.297 --> 05:33.298
What do you think?

05:36.335 --> 05:39.205
You are the man, man.

05:39.237 --> 05:40.706
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

05:40.739 --> 05:42.507
Here it is.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.443
Suit you up and go.

05:46.011 --> 05:48.447
Okay. Keys?

05:48.480 --> 05:52.484
I got your promise,
not a scratch...

05:52.518 --> 05:54.087
promise me.

05:54.119 --> 05:56.088
Not a scratch...
I'm serious.

05:56.121 --> 05:57.689
Dead serious.
I'll kill you!

05:57.722 --> 05:59.559
I'll revive you
and kill you again

05:59.592 --> 06:01.260
and again and again!

06:01.292 --> 06:04.129
-I...
-Yeah, yeah.

06:04.162 --> 06:06.232
Just watch it.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.168
Hey, sicko.
Wait up.

06:10.102 --> 06:12.672
What?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.407
-Here.
-The diary?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.243
Watch your back.

06:19.277 --> 06:21.414
You know me.

06:21.446 --> 06:23.316
Exactly.

06:35.494 --> 06:37.229
Hey, bubba,
I found the inner fence.

06:37.263 --> 06:38.498
Are you sure
it's the right one?

06:38.530 --> 06:41.366
I think so.
It looks right.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.301
-What about the guards?
-Forget 'em.

06:43.335 --> 06:45.705
-They're not here.
-Electric fence?

06:45.737 --> 06:48.107
-Off line.
-Are you sure?

06:48.140 --> 06:50.209
-Yeah. I checked.
-Okay.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.578
Then let's do it.

06:52.611 --> 06:55.448
God! Let go!
Markus, let go!

06:55.480 --> 06:58.316
Please! Don't die!
Please, Markus, don't die!

06:58.350 --> 07:00.487
Markus!

07:01.787 --> 07:04.323
Markus?

07:04.355 --> 07:06.792
Damn! Fuck...
Fuck you, man!

07:06.825 --> 07:09.429
You should have
seen your face!

07:09.462 --> 07:12.565
-I almost had a heart attack.
-Someone just shit his pants.

07:12.597 --> 07:16.602
I hope you step
on a fucking landmine

07:16.635 --> 07:18.704
you cocksucker.

07:18.737 --> 07:19.838
Yeah, but you would
like that.

07:19.871 --> 07:21.506
Just for the record,

07:21.539 --> 07:23.241
I knew you were kidding.

07:23.275 --> 07:26.613
-Of course you did.
-You're still an idiot.

07:30.282 --> 07:32.252
You're welcome.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.360
Fuck.

07:42.393 --> 07:44.563
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

07:44.597 --> 07:47.233
What? What's wrong?

07:47.265 --> 07:49.869
-What's wrong? There's a patrol!
-What?

07:49.902 --> 07:52.405
-Did they see you?
-I don't know.

07:56.575 --> 07:59.512
Fuck! They're stopping.

07:59.544 --> 08:01.513
Don't do anything stupid.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.215
Did you hear me?

08:03.249 --> 08:04.883
-Quiet.
-Markus!

08:04.917 --> 08:06.518
Hey, what's wrong?

08:06.551 --> 08:07.686
There was a guy
on the street.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.554
I saw him.

08:09.587 --> 08:11.624
Come on. That was
just a stupid animal.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.193
Bavarian yeti... whatever
the fuck they call it.

08:14.225 --> 08:15.393
It's wolpertinger.

08:15.426 --> 08:17.429
Yeah, wolpertinger.

08:17.462 --> 08:20.299
Sounds like a bratwurst.

08:20.332 --> 08:22.235
Hey. I don't care.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.169
We got a job to do here.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.837
All of a sudden,
you give a shit?

08:25.871 --> 08:27.640
Yeah. It's probably nothing.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.174
Of course it's nothing.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.544
Just like your girlfriend.

08:32.577 --> 08:34.513
She's still better
than your right hand.

08:34.547 --> 08:38.216
And I have to take a leak.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.624
What the...? What?

08:44.657 --> 08:48.293
Man!
Man!

08:48.326 --> 08:50.595
-Man!
-Speed this up!

08:50.628 --> 08:52.330
Fuck you.

08:52.364 --> 08:53.766
Small things have
big beginnings.

08:53.798 --> 08:55.134
Seriously, man.

08:58.470 --> 09:01.840
Dude, I'm off duty in 30.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.646
Let's roll.

09:06.678 --> 09:09.481
'Bout time, motherfucker.

09:09.514 --> 09:10.749
Next time,
bring a diaper!

09:20.658 --> 09:23.229
No, no, no, no!

09:23.262 --> 09:26.364
What? You have your phone?

09:26.398 --> 09:28.801
-Shit.
-Great, now we're done for.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.671
I come in peace!

09:33.672 --> 09:35.675
God!
Tell me where to go!

09:35.707 --> 09:37.876
No way!

09:37.909 --> 09:39.844
Left. Go left.

09:39.878 --> 09:42.547
-No, the other left.
-You mean right!

09:42.580 --> 09:45.951
Shit!

09:45.984 --> 09:47.419
Markus!

09:47.452 --> 09:51.389
Hey! Stay right there!

09:51.422 --> 09:52.991
In your dreams!

09:53.024 --> 09:56.294
Shit. My dad's gonna kill me.

10:07.505 --> 10:10.442
What a bunch of losers!

10:10.475 --> 10:13.645
They're as slow
as bubba!

10:13.678 --> 10:15.814
What?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.386
No, no, no, no.

10:20.418 --> 10:22.454
No, no.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.424
Don't move.
Don't move, baby.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.494
Don't even think about it.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.864
Sorry about that.

10:31.897 --> 10:35.667
Ext time,
you'll get a kiss.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.603
-Hey! Drop the gun!
-Here.

10:37.635 --> 10:39.938
Hey, give me a call!

10:50.983 --> 10:53.720
The dam.
I found it.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.857
The dam, bubba.
I found the damned dam.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.557
Bubba? Bubba!

10:59.590 --> 11:01.426
Can you see it?

11:01.460 --> 11:03.595
I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

11:03.628 --> 11:05.531
Shit. There's a guard.

11:05.564 --> 11:08.768
Now stop being a pussy and
tell me where the entrance is.

11:08.801 --> 11:12.470
It's somewhere
at the bottom of the dam.

11:12.503 --> 11:14.874
Okay. Piece of cake.

11:14.907 --> 11:18.444
Yeah. Just make sure
they don't see you again.

11:18.476 --> 11:21.047
Roger.
Cloaking device activated.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.782
Would you please
take this seriously?

11:23.816 --> 11:25.651
Relax.

11:25.683 --> 11:27.485
Stein wrote in his diary

11:27.518 --> 11:29.321
about a steam exhaust.

11:29.354 --> 11:32.057
-Look for that.
-Exhaust. Okay.

11:34.526 --> 11:37.096
-Can you see it?
-No.

11:37.128 --> 11:38.663
It's full of water.

11:38.696 --> 11:40.465
You didn't tell me
about the water!

11:40.499 --> 11:42.667
That's why it's called a "dam."

11:42.700 --> 11:44.003
Have you lost your mind?

11:44.036 --> 11:46.806
Do I look like
a fucking sailor to you?

11:46.839 --> 11:49.041
No! Wait!

11:49.074 --> 11:50.075
Markus!

12:00.686 --> 12:02.754
Hello? Thomas?

12:02.787 --> 12:04.757
Thomas,
can you hear me?

12:06.657 --> 12:08.094
Thomas?

12:09.494 --> 12:11.864
Thomas? Thomas,
do you copy?

12:13.898 --> 12:15.835
Thomas.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.770
Thomas, do you copy?

12:17.802 --> 12:19.772
I copy! You're alive!

12:19.805 --> 12:21.640
Thank god
you're alive.

12:21.672 --> 12:24.042
-I seriously thought you were dead.
-Man, me, too.

12:24.075 --> 12:26.111
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.813
-Just a scratch.
-I lost you for over 2º minutes

12:28.846 --> 12:30.882
and the army's
looking for you.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.386
Where the hell
are you, man?

12:33.418 --> 12:35.920
I have no idea.
I have absolutely no idea

12:35.954 --> 12:38.691
but you gotta see this.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.098
What...
What the...?

12:46.130 --> 12:49.599
Holy cow.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.774
Isn't that crazy?

12:54.806 --> 12:56.675
Look at this shit.

12:56.707 --> 12:59.544
This could be the exhaust
Stein was talking about.

12:59.577 --> 13:02.047
Bubba, this is it.
No doubt.

13:03.148 --> 13:04.750
Going in now.

13:06.718 --> 13:08.788
Be careful.

13:15.561 --> 13:19.697
Shit.
This is awesome.

13:19.730 --> 13:21.900
I'm the first human being
down here.

13:21.933 --> 13:24.202
I feel like
Lance Armstrong.

13:24.235 --> 13:26.739
-It's "one small step for"...
-Neil.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.041
-What?
-Neil Armstrong.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.444
It's Neil Armstrong
and his steps.

13:31.476 --> 13:33.878
-You idiot.
-Are you sure?

13:33.912 --> 13:35.815
Yes, I am.

13:35.848 --> 13:39.484
Okay. Okay.
I trust you.

13:39.518 --> 13:42.220
What's wrong?

13:42.253 --> 13:44.123
Dead end.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.825
Looks like
I have to dive.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.661
Set up the hub
before you do.

13:51.662 --> 13:53.599
I hope
those things work.

13:53.632 --> 13:57.503
They'll do their job.
Trust me.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.172
Okay. Then let's see
where this is going.

14:00.205 --> 14:03.475
See you later!

14:42.080 --> 14:44.016
Shit, is the water cold!

14:44.048 --> 14:46.018
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.820
Okay.

14:47.853 --> 14:51.691
This... man.
This is man-made.

14:53.024 --> 14:55.827
-This...
-Look at this.

14:57.262 --> 15:00.900
We really found it!

15:00.932 --> 15:02.667
Yes.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.903
This is crazy.

15:06.638 --> 15:09.742
Fucking crazy.

15:09.774 --> 15:12.811
-Hub up.
-Okay, bubba. Up.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.853
Okay. Where do you
want me to go?

15:20.885 --> 15:24.289
The gold should be
on the second level.

15:24.322 --> 15:25.991
You gotta find
a way up.

15:29.027 --> 15:32.064
What the fuck?

15:32.096 --> 15:33.932
Do you see that?

15:33.965 --> 15:37.001
I see it.

15:37.034 --> 15:39.837
But what...

15:39.870 --> 15:41.139
Wait, that's it!

15:41.172 --> 15:42.741
That's what
we're looking for.

15:50.648 --> 15:53.217
-What the fuck?
-What?

15:53.250 --> 15:55.554
I wonder what
happened down here.

15:57.955 --> 16:01.192
But, Markus.

16:01.225 --> 16:05.364
That's disgusting!

16:05.397 --> 16:07.266
Then stop touching it!

16:11.902 --> 16:15.306
God.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.276
Just want to see
if it still works.

16:17.308 --> 16:19.711
After 70 years? Never.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.383
Great.
Made in Germany.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.685
What was that?

16:26.718 --> 16:28.053
-Did you hear that?
-I did.

16:28.085 --> 16:31.156
Maybe it's air shifting
or bats.

16:31.189 --> 16:33.693
Bats? I hate bats!

16:41.966 --> 16:43.835
Hey, by the way,
did you actually think about

16:43.869 --> 16:46.305
how we can get
all the gold out?

16:46.338 --> 16:49.875
Let's just find it first.

16:49.907 --> 16:52.378
Yeah.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.319
Markus?

17:02.287 --> 17:03.755
Markus, I'm losing
the signal.

17:04.954 --> 17:07.157
Hey...

17:07.192 --> 17:11.631
Hey, once again hub up.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.032
Great. Good job.

17:17.101 --> 17:19.405
-Better?
-Better.

17:21.238 --> 17:22.940
Scheisse!

17:22.973 --> 17:26.011
-What?
-I saw someone.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.714
I didn't see anything.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.882
He was right there. A man.

17:34.218 --> 17:36.921
I'm sure I'm not alone
down here.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.724
Sicko, there's no one
down there but you.

17:38.756 --> 17:40.859
Just chill out.

17:40.891 --> 17:41.893
What the...?

17:43.728 --> 17:45.697
-There!
-Fuck!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.933
-You see him now?
-Yeah.

17:47.965 --> 17:49.834
But I don't
know what I saw.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.404
I'm not sure
that was a man.

17:52.436 --> 17:55.707
Maybe the light...
Shadows fooled us.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.342
Shit. I'm not blind.

17:57.375 --> 18:02.047
There's something
very alive down here.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.881
Sicko, the only thing
alive down there

18:03.915 --> 18:06.118
is your imagination.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.853
But, just in case,
be careful.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.756
Be very, very careful.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.893
Great.

18:24.034 --> 18:26.071
This looks promising.

18:26.103 --> 18:30.174
-I think you're on the right track.
-Yeah. Okay.

18:30.207 --> 18:33.277
It doesn't get any higher.

18:36.447 --> 18:40.518
And no gold so far.

18:40.551 --> 18:42.821
Nothing in here.

18:42.853 --> 18:46.357
-Maybe here.
-Be careful, man.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.731
Smelly!

18:53.497 --> 18:55.199
Look at this mess!

18:55.233 --> 18:57.802
No wonder
we have lost war.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.377
Excuse me.

19:05.409 --> 19:08.279
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.851
Markus.

19:24.562 --> 19:27.198
Hey, how much
can we get for it on ebay?

19:27.232 --> 19:30.168
Two, three hundred
bucks maybe?

19:30.202 --> 19:31.869
Peanuts.

19:31.903 --> 19:33.405
Where's my gold?

19:39.010 --> 19:41.379
Did that sound
like a bat to you?

19:41.413 --> 19:44.483
No... sounded like...

19:44.515 --> 19:46.951
Came from downstairs.

19:46.984 --> 19:48.219
What are you doing?

19:48.253 --> 19:50.422
It doesn't matter.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.924
I'm going after it.

19:51.956 --> 19:54.193
What? Markus, are you nuts?

19:54.225 --> 19:55.927
Maybe it's the army.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.596
I don't want to get
shot again.

19:57.628 --> 20:00.398
Dude, I can't hear you.

20:00.432 --> 20:03.001
The army never
found this place.

20:03.033 --> 20:04.969
There's absolutely
nobody down here.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.004
-Shit!
-There. You see?

20:07.038 --> 20:08.473
I'm not crazy.

20:08.505 --> 20:10.875
Hey, missus.
Hey, hey.

20:10.908 --> 20:12.977
Holy shit.
Boobs!

20:13.011 --> 20:17.416
Fuck!
Attacking boobs!

20:17.448 --> 20:19.551
I'm running!
I'm running!

20:23.955 --> 20:26.390
What the hell is that?

20:26.424 --> 20:30.195
Stay...

20:30.227 --> 20:32.196
Out!

20:39.603 --> 20:40.872
You gotta get outta there.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.273
She's gone.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.909
Find me a way
out of here, fatso!

20:43.942 --> 20:47.446
All right, run! Don't stop.

20:47.478 --> 20:50.314
Just keep going, man.
Don't stop.

20:50.348 --> 20:52.050
Don't stop, all right!

20:52.082 --> 20:53.886
Holy fuck!

20:53.918 --> 20:55.987
Get away from me!

21:00.125 --> 21:02.994
I will stick my imaginary
foot up your ass!

21:03.028 --> 21:04.296
I'm sorry, man.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.499
How was I
supposed to know?

21:07.532 --> 21:12.303
No gold, but zombies. Great!

21:12.337 --> 21:16.608
-What the...? God.
-That's not fair!

21:18.542 --> 21:20.212
Don't let him bite you!

21:20.244 --> 21:21.914
Don't let him bite you!

21:21.946 --> 21:25.417
Would you please
stop shouting at me?

21:25.449 --> 21:26.584
Fuck!

21:26.618 --> 21:29.321
Fuck.

21:29.353 --> 21:32.090
Perfect!

21:37.262 --> 21:39.398
Hey you, Nazi!
Watch this!

21:39.430 --> 21:41.966
Nazi, watch this!

21:42.000 --> 21:44.269
Markus?

21:44.301 --> 21:46.605
Markus, are you there?

21:46.638 --> 21:49.107
Markus? Markus!
I can't see you!

21:49.139 --> 21:51.176
Markus!

21:53.610 --> 21:55.147
Calm down. I'm here.

21:55.179 --> 21:56.514
Look, you've gotta
see this.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.684
Zombie on a stick.

21:58.716 --> 22:00.051
God, stop it.

22:00.084 --> 22:01.686
God in heaven!
You are so sick!

22:01.719 --> 22:04.322
I am sick?

22:04.356 --> 22:06.325
I am sick?
You are the one

22:06.358 --> 22:09.360
who sent me up here in a
fucking nest of Nazi zombies!

22:12.330 --> 22:13.631
I'm done listening
to your going-up shit.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.401
I'm going down
to the fucking bottom

22:16.434 --> 22:18.470
of this
fucked up place.

22:20.304 --> 22:22.674
You fat fuck,
fuck you!

22:25.642 --> 22:28.446
-Yeah, you.
-I'm sorry.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.749
I'm sorry. I'll get you outta here.
I promise.

22:30.782 --> 22:34.319
I'll get you outta there.
Calm down, okay?

22:34.351 --> 22:36.421
-You gotta relax.
-I am relaxed.

22:40.324 --> 22:43.160
But this is really
fucked up.

22:43.194 --> 22:46.565
Next time, find another
Guinea pig for adventures.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.334
Come on.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.050
Fuck!

23:05.082 --> 23:07.753
Fuck!

23:07.785 --> 23:10.488
And you stop
staring at me!

23:10.522 --> 23:14.092
What...
What the fuck?

23:16.761 --> 23:18.562
I don't...

23:18.596 --> 23:21.433
I don't...

23:21.465 --> 23:22.667
There...

23:22.699 --> 23:24.668
It's coming
from behind the door.

23:24.702 --> 23:27.239
Run! Run, Markus!

23:27.272 --> 23:28.572
No. No more running.

23:31.176 --> 23:34.311
Come on, there's more
where that came from.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.789
Here, take a seat.

23:43.821 --> 23:45.491
I said, "sit down."

23:50.861 --> 23:52.797
Touch down!

23:54.331 --> 23:57.468
Yeah, you made the point.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.571
You really like this,
don't you?

23:59.603 --> 24:03.507
Stop talking and start looking
for a way out.

24:03.541 --> 24:06.177
You again.

24:06.211 --> 24:09.281
Markus?

24:10.747 --> 24:12.783
I'm gonna kick your ass
Freeman-style.

24:26.363 --> 24:28.366
No kissing
on second date, bitch.

24:37.675 --> 24:39.411
Did you find me
a way out yet?

24:39.444 --> 24:42.481
I'm on it.
I'm on it, okay?

24:42.513 --> 24:44.817
These maps aren't
easy to read.

24:48.552 --> 24:51.656
Look, tanks.

24:51.688 --> 24:55.826
What did you expect?
It is a military base.

24:55.859 --> 24:57.762
Come on, how cool is that?

24:57.794 --> 24:59.764
Fucking tanks.

25:01.698 --> 25:04.535
Good for you.

25:14.344 --> 25:16.648
In any case, we are still
in the right place.

25:19.716 --> 25:21.887
Man.
This is so awesome.

25:21.919 --> 25:24.188
Don't touch them.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.490
Why not?

25:26.558 --> 25:31.263
He looks angry.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.499
You touched his tank,

25:34.532 --> 25:35.934
your fault.

25:37.334 --> 25:39.303
You kidding me?

26:23.880 --> 26:25.249
Hey, bubba,

26:25.282 --> 26:26.751
you making any progress
up there?

26:26.783 --> 26:28.786
Hey, you try and stay alive.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.621
I'm working on it.

26:30.655 --> 26:33.258
Yeah, take your time.
I'm busy, too.

27:04.722 --> 27:06.892
Okay, sicko,
I found you a way out.

27:10.994 --> 27:13.031
So, where is it?

27:13.063 --> 27:15.367
The air ventilation shafts
in the main hangar.

27:18.369 --> 27:19.803
And you know the location?

27:19.837 --> 27:21.773
Sure...

27:21.805 --> 27:23.440
Sounds good.

27:23.474 --> 27:25.810
Let me just finish this.

27:25.842 --> 27:27.278
What are you...

27:27.311 --> 27:30.648
What's that good for
now anyway?

27:31.782 --> 27:33.885
I wanna be
the first German

27:33.917 --> 27:37.554
burning down
this fucking flag.

27:37.588 --> 27:39.523
Yeah, I'm curious
how you'll like it

27:39.557 --> 27:42.327
when the flames attract dozens of
those zombies to your location.

27:42.359 --> 27:45.030
Let them come.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.036
God. Why?

27:52.070 --> 27:53.804
Are you done?

27:53.838 --> 27:55.440
Nope.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.946
Okay, now I'm done.

28:01.978 --> 28:04.715
What about those shafts?

28:04.748 --> 28:06.850
You have to find
the main hangar.

28:06.884 --> 28:09.521
Okay, left or right?

28:09.553 --> 28:12.090
Left.

28:12.122 --> 28:16.927
Okay.

28:16.961 --> 28:20.365
What...

28:20.398 --> 28:22.067
Didn't you say
the U.S. army

28:22.100 --> 28:23.901
didn't know
about this place?

28:23.935 --> 28:26.870
yeah...

28:26.904 --> 28:28.640
Tell me again.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.608
No, I won't.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.812
Anyway, the main hangar should
be in this area of the plant.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.382
What the hell happened
down here?

28:37.415 --> 28:39.050
Give me a closer look.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.520
Didn't you tell me
to be careful?

28:42.552 --> 28:45.489
Yeah...
Then give me a "careful" closer look.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.427
Yeah... great.

28:50.461 --> 28:52.931
I just don't get...

28:52.964 --> 28:55.567
-What?
-That is not from world war two.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.735
That's an m16 assault rifle
from the '60s.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.838
It doesn't make
any sense.

28:59.870 --> 29:00.905
Why?

29:00.937 --> 29:02.540
Because this base

29:02.572 --> 29:05.476
was officially shut down
and sealed off in 1945.

29:08.812 --> 29:11.116
Hello, there.

29:11.148 --> 29:13.517
Come here,
my little friend.

29:13.551 --> 29:17.621
Yeah. Much better
than a crowbar.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.858
Forget it. It's too old.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.458
You never know.

29:26.930 --> 29:30.534
Fuck!

29:30.568 --> 29:34.071
The land of the free, the land of
the brave, the land of the dead.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.974
You fucking losers.

29:36.006 --> 29:38.042
You fucking losers.

29:40.177 --> 29:42.045
Sicko! God,
I'm giving up on you.

29:42.079 --> 29:43.548
Stop talking to me,

29:43.580 --> 29:45.384
you're just
another voice in my head.

29:48.119 --> 29:52.157
Come on.
How fucking big is this plant?

29:52.189 --> 29:55.959
About three square miles.

29:55.993 --> 29:59.431
And you sure I'm going in
the right direction?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.800
If I tell you now, you're just
going to blame me later.

30:04.534 --> 30:06.503
Fair enough.

30:14.946 --> 30:17.014
I think
I'll take this way.

30:33.129 --> 30:35.867
Could this be
where they kept the gold?

30:35.899 --> 30:37.067
I don't know.

30:42.673 --> 30:45.577
Then where is the fucking gold?

30:45.609 --> 30:47.611
Come on.
There's no gold in here.

30:47.645 --> 30:48.879
It's all gone.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.782
Fuck!

30:53.751 --> 30:54.918
Wait.

30:54.952 --> 30:56.588
Hold on.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.990
Could this be...

31:04.594 --> 31:06.129
It is.

31:06.163 --> 31:07.966
We're rich! Gold!

31:07.998 --> 31:09.566
Gold! We found it!

31:09.600 --> 31:11.569
Aren't you forgetting
something?

31:11.601 --> 31:12.970
Is there more?
Where? Where?

31:13.003 --> 31:14.973
Here? There?

31:15.005 --> 31:18.609
I'm talking about Nazis.
Zombies. Death.

31:20.043 --> 31:22.847
I'm rich.

31:22.879 --> 31:25.015
Look, you got your gold,
now get out of there.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.653
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.
I'm going.

31:30.554 --> 31:31.656
Okay...

31:31.688 --> 31:33.123
Do you hear that?

31:33.157 --> 31:37.195
Yeah... definitely one
of my friends.

31:41.064 --> 31:42.833
There you are.

31:42.867 --> 31:43.935
Hey...

31:46.904 --> 31:47.972
You're okay?

31:48.004 --> 31:49.139
Can you believe that?

31:49.173 --> 31:50.675
This fucker
tried to shoot me.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.186
Hey, there's no other way.

32:02.218 --> 32:06.189
You have to get past him.

32:06.223 --> 32:07.959
Okay. Wait...

32:07.992 --> 32:09.127
Wait, I think
I got an idea.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.796
What are you gonna do?

32:11.829 --> 32:14.198
Are you insane?

32:15.966 --> 32:17.768
Can you see?

32:17.801 --> 32:20.705
I see...
I see you're brain-dead.

32:20.737 --> 32:23.073
No, not that.

32:23.107 --> 32:27.845
This fucker
is mimicking me.

32:27.878 --> 32:31.282
And that's good for what?

32:31.314 --> 32:36.186
I'm show you.

32:36.219 --> 32:37.654
Watch and learn...

32:37.687 --> 32:40.057
Bang!

32:42.792 --> 32:44.995
Sometimes I even
amaze myself.

32:45.029 --> 32:47.132
And I'm sure they have
pills for that.

32:51.936 --> 32:54.071
I'm sure I'm running
in circles.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.841
This place
can't be that big.

32:56.873 --> 32:58.342
No, no, trust me.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.645
This should be
the right way.

33:00.677 --> 33:03.915
You said "should."

33:03.947 --> 33:05.850
Okay, you're lost.

33:05.882 --> 33:09.753
I don't feel amazed anymore.

33:09.786 --> 33:11.355
Look these maps are crap.

33:11.388 --> 33:14.125
They're too old after all,
they're wrong.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.325
It's not my fault.

33:15.359 --> 33:17.762
I'm gonna guide myself now.

33:17.794 --> 33:20.130
You useless piece of shit.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.233
Okay, okay, okay.

33:22.265 --> 33:23.667
Okay, let's see.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.938
Can't be that hard.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.406
Forget it.
I already did that.

33:28.438 --> 33:33.176
There's no map of the
interior in this book.

33:33.209 --> 33:35.078
What?

33:35.111 --> 33:39.216
There's no map you could use
in this book, Markus.

33:39.250 --> 33:43.287
Then why the fuck did you
even give me this useless crap?

33:45.990 --> 33:47.091
Did you hear that?

33:47.123 --> 33:48.258
Hear what?

33:48.292 --> 33:50.427
Come on. Get a doctor.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.196
There's someone talking.

33:52.228 --> 33:55.165
Talking? Talk about
who needs a doctor.

33:58.234 --> 34:00.705
There, again.
It's definitely a voice.

34:03.707 --> 34:05.142
I don't know, man.

34:05.176 --> 34:07.044
Maybe it's the venting system
we're looking for?

34:07.078 --> 34:10.882
Venting system?
It's a fucking voice.

34:10.915 --> 34:13.284
Okay, what does it say?

34:13.317 --> 34:14.418
I don't know.

34:19.355 --> 34:21.891
Can you locate where
the voice is coming from?

34:21.926 --> 34:25.929
No.

34:25.962 --> 34:27.764
Hey, a fuse box.

34:27.797 --> 34:30.234
Maybe I can get
some power down here.

34:30.266 --> 34:33.103
Give it a try.

34:33.136 --> 34:35.739
Okay.

34:37.340 --> 34:41.045
-Markus.
-Light. I got light!

34:43.013 --> 34:45.148
I can't believe it still works
after all those years.

34:45.181 --> 34:46.250
Amazing.

34:46.282 --> 34:49.152
What the fuck is this?

34:49.185 --> 34:53.389
Holy shit.

34:57.127 --> 34:59.129
God.

35:02.299 --> 35:03.935
This is huge.

35:03.967 --> 35:07.170
What?

35:07.203 --> 35:09.005
Okay, what's next? Elvis...

35:10.406 --> 35:12.008
What was that?

35:15.011 --> 35:18.115
Bubba, please tell me
you know what this is.

35:20.317 --> 35:23.821
Yeah... I know what that is.

35:23.853 --> 35:25.056
And I'm quite sure
it's something

35:25.089 --> 35:26.291
you better stay away from.

35:34.464 --> 35:37.167
Looks like someone
was very angry.

35:42.172 --> 35:44.475
I really wanna know
what's inside.

35:44.507 --> 35:46.243
No. You don't.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.413
Hey, at least it could
be valuable.

35:50.047 --> 35:51.315
Here's a handle.

35:51.348 --> 35:52.984
No! Don't touch it!

35:53.016 --> 35:54.317
Markus!

35:54.351 --> 35:58.189
Stop me, if you can.

35:59.522 --> 36:02.159
Damn it!

36:09.465 --> 36:11.301
-Fuck!
-I told you, don't open it.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.938
I told you,
I told you, I told you.

36:13.971 --> 36:17.208
Run! Markus, run!

36:41.965 --> 36:46.203
Aliens!
Man, fucking aliens!

36:46.237 --> 36:48.339
I just peed my pants.

36:48.371 --> 36:49.473
That's awesome.

36:49.505 --> 36:51.975
Awesome, awesome. What...

36:52.009 --> 36:53.578
Markus? Markus?

36:53.610 --> 36:55.879
Daniels, secure the perimeter.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.248
Johnson,
handcuff him.

36:57.281 --> 37:00.618
And let's get
this motherfucker topside.

37:02.085 --> 37:03.854
Fuck! Freeze!

37:03.888 --> 37:05.556
Daniels, cover me!
Fuck! No!

37:05.589 --> 37:07.525
What the fuck is it?
No! Shoot it!

37:07.558 --> 37:09.893
Shoot it in the head!

37:11.060 --> 37:13.563
I can't stop him!

37:17.333 --> 37:20.605
My god!
Daniels, Johnson! No!

37:35.219 --> 37:36.253
I can't feel my legs.

37:44.094 --> 37:48.099
Fuck, my head.

37:48.132 --> 37:49.532
No, no, no!

37:49.565 --> 37:51.168
No!

37:52.603 --> 37:54.171
What the hell?

37:54.203 --> 37:57.073
Can you see this?
Hey! Hey!

37:57.107 --> 38:00.344
Bubba! Hey! Fuck, fuck!
No, not now!

38:00.377 --> 38:01.978
Shit.

38:02.011 --> 38:04.080
Fuck.

38:04.114 --> 38:05.416
Fuck!

38:06.683 --> 38:07.984
Okay, okay, okay.

38:08.018 --> 38:09.220
Calm down.

38:09.252 --> 38:11.922
You are dead.
I am fine. You are not.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.492
Weapons.
I need a weapon.

38:14.525 --> 38:18.663
Okay. Yes.
Come to daddy.

38:18.696 --> 38:20.665
Yeah.
That's the real thing.

38:28.404 --> 38:30.674
Man, if I survive
this shit,

38:30.708 --> 38:35.579
I know a fat black guy
who's in big trouble.

38:35.612 --> 38:37.415
In painful trouble.

38:37.447 --> 38:42.152
I'm gonna kick
you're fucking fat ass.

38:42.185 --> 38:44.388
Bloody bastard.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.701
Okay...

39:03.239 --> 39:05.709
Man.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.712
I have a bad feeling
about this.

39:12.549 --> 39:14.418
Freeze!
Hold it right there!

39:14.451 --> 39:15.453
Don't shoot, it's me.

39:15.485 --> 39:17.989
Not you again.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.257
-What's wrong?
-It's him, the German.

39:21.290 --> 39:25.261
-Get him in here.
-Come on, all right, buddy.

39:25.295 --> 39:29.233
Get over here.

39:31.134 --> 39:33.069
So you're
the pain in my ass?

39:34.438 --> 39:36.273
Duke, secure him.

39:36.306 --> 39:38.708
Asshole, come on.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.613
Don't move.

39:42.645 --> 39:44.514
Listen, asswipe,

39:44.547 --> 39:47.517
my grandfather killed you
Nazi fuckheads by the dozens.

39:47.551 --> 39:51.589
And I have no problem blowing your
brain out of your German head!

39:51.621 --> 39:54.024
Why don't you suck
my balls?

40:04.134 --> 40:06.771
Psst, hey little one!

40:06.804 --> 40:08.339
You in the big helmet.

40:08.371 --> 40:11.442
Excuse me,
when are we going to leave?

40:11.475 --> 40:12.710
-You?
-What?

40:12.743 --> 40:14.177
Well, shit, sorry!

40:14.210 --> 40:16.279
Ma'am... misses...
Private... sir.

40:16.313 --> 40:17.515
It was an accident, okay?

40:17.547 --> 40:19.350
Easy, easy...

40:19.382 --> 40:21.151
I'm sorry for your lip, okay?

40:21.185 --> 40:22.487
I never wanted
to hurt you.

40:25.522 --> 40:29.460
Hey, don't lose your head
over her.

40:29.493 --> 40:32.362
She's like that
with everybody.

40:32.395 --> 40:33.763
Pms, you know?

40:33.797 --> 40:36.534
It's okay, o'Neil.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.369
All right...

40:38.402 --> 40:40.071
Calm down.

40:40.103 --> 40:43.473
That's why she didn't
give me a call.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.810
Say, what happened here?

40:45.842 --> 40:48.111
I had no problem
killing all those zombies,

40:48.145 --> 40:50.648
how come you army guys
got hammered so hard?

40:50.681 --> 40:52.550
Man,
I don't know.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.118
We were attacked
by something big,

40:54.150 --> 40:56.419
bigger than anything
you've seen down here.

40:56.453 --> 40:57.721
We tried
to give 'em cover,

40:57.753 --> 41:00.257
but shit...
We didn't stand a chance.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.625
Fuck, everything
happened so fast.

41:02.659 --> 41:05.229
Great.
I want bubba back.

41:05.261 --> 41:06.563
You okay, dude?

41:06.596 --> 41:08.264
What do you think?

41:08.297 --> 41:09.566
I can't help you
with those, buddy.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.634
I'm not in charge here.

41:11.668 --> 41:15.239
Hey, come on. We both know
you're not down here for me.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.773
That's the spirit, boy.

41:16.806 --> 41:18.408
I like that.

41:18.442 --> 41:21.212
You know, it's all top secret
and all but...

41:21.244 --> 41:22.446
They said
we'd find this "thing"

41:22.478 --> 41:24.614
in some sort
of carrying container.

41:24.647 --> 41:26.783
We got there
this thing was empty.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.418
And man,
the sarge was pissed.

41:28.451 --> 41:30.286
Sounds creepy.

41:30.319 --> 41:31.388
Taylor, get over here.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.756
Yes, sir.

41:37.326 --> 41:40.363
Get it off me!

41:40.397 --> 41:42.366
God damn it.

41:42.398 --> 41:44.868
Fuck, fuck!
Man!

41:44.902 --> 41:46.270
Man down over here.

41:46.302 --> 41:48.272
We need a medic.
We need a medic.

41:48.304 --> 41:49.706
-Shit is out of control.
-Fire in the hole.

41:49.739 --> 41:52.208
Where are the other units?

41:52.241 --> 41:54.611
We have to get out
of here, sir.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.780
-It's fucked.
-Yes, sir. Copy that.

41:56.813 --> 41:58.715
Sir, I lost half of our unit.

41:58.748 --> 42:00.683
Request backup
and permission to fall back.

42:00.717 --> 42:03.253
Hey, can I help you?
Hey, hey, can I help you?

42:03.286 --> 42:04.420
No. Back off.

42:04.453 --> 42:06.222
Are you serious? Yes, sir.

42:06.255 --> 42:08.826
-Over and out.
-Can't stop the bleeding.

42:08.859 --> 42:12.462
-Man...
-Sir, what did command say?

42:12.496 --> 42:15.266
You step back,
soldier.

42:15.299 --> 42:17.935
Ladies, we're on
our own now.

42:17.967 --> 42:21.839
Okay, let's check if there's
more creatures down here.

42:21.871 --> 42:23.406
I don't want
any more surprises.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.877
-But we're not enough...
-You hear me, soldier.

42:26.909 --> 42:30.380
Okay, let's go.
Start with this area here.

42:30.413 --> 42:31.881
Make sure the hallways
are clear.

42:31.915 --> 42:33.784
-Yes, sir. Move! Move!
-This is suicide.

42:33.817 --> 42:36.353
Get to work and shut up.

42:36.386 --> 42:38.755
That's an order,
soldier.

42:38.788 --> 42:40.890
Yes, sir.

42:40.924 --> 42:43.694
Not you,
you stay with meyers.

42:43.726 --> 42:46.230
-He didn't make it.
-You stay with...

42:46.263 --> 42:48.431
He's dead, sir.

42:48.464 --> 42:51.901
Fuck it.
Fuckers.

42:51.935 --> 42:53.670
This shit
is so fucked up.

42:57.273 --> 42:59.509
Taylor, get me
that German asshole.

42:59.543 --> 43:01.378
Yes, sir.
Come on, move.

43:06.850 --> 43:10.821
Listen, boy.
Don't get in our way.

43:10.853 --> 43:12.889
And don't act
like a fool.

43:12.922 --> 43:17.227
Then we'll all get
out of here in one piece.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.596
Is that understood?

43:19.630 --> 43:22.233
No problem. I'm easy.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.536
Good. He's all yours.

43:27.737 --> 43:30.373
Hey, you better not
piss him off.

43:30.406 --> 43:31.941
Stay here,
keep quiet.

43:31.975 --> 43:34.011
-Fuck, shit!
-Fuck, shit!

43:34.043 --> 43:35.980
Fuck! Get away from him!

43:36.013 --> 43:37.648
What the hell.

43:39.382 --> 43:40.750
Drop him!

43:50.360 --> 43:52.563
Watch out! Watch out!

44:23.659 --> 44:24.795
You okay?

44:24.828 --> 44:28.599
Yeah.
Eat this, kraut.

44:28.632 --> 44:30.634
Yeah, I just can't believe
this is really happening.

44:30.667 --> 44:32.636
What should we do?

44:32.668 --> 44:34.705
-Quiet.
-Not sure that's gonna save us.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.542
Hey, hey, he's still alive.

44:38.574 --> 44:39.609
Man, look, he's still alive.

44:39.643 --> 44:42.646
Shit, sir!

44:42.679 --> 44:44.447
Listen to me, soldiers...

44:52.723 --> 44:54.358
Backup's not coming.

44:54.391 --> 44:56.659
You have to get
outta here, now.

44:56.692 --> 44:58.361
Help's on the way.

44:58.395 --> 45:01.498
No, no, it's...

45:01.531 --> 45:05.402
Run... now, go...

45:05.435 --> 45:08.038
They don't
want us alive.

45:08.071 --> 45:11.407
They...

45:13.043 --> 45:15.878
Shit. Fuck!

45:15.911 --> 45:17.380
It doesn't make any sense.

45:17.413 --> 45:18.982
No.

45:19.014 --> 45:20.551
Excuse me!

45:20.583 --> 45:22.685
What part of "run"
didn't you understand?

45:22.719 --> 45:24.855
-Fucking radio.
-Shut up!

45:24.888 --> 45:28.025
No. Are you fucking stupid?
He said run.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.694
We have to get out of here.

45:30.726 --> 45:32.929
Echo three to echo seven,
do you copy?

45:32.962 --> 45:35.631
-Hey, hey, listen! Hey!
-Stay away from him.

45:35.665 --> 45:37.000
Don't touch him.

45:37.032 --> 45:39.869
Fuck!

45:39.902 --> 45:42.939
Listen, o'Neil.

45:42.973 --> 45:46.976
I know what he meant,
and he was right.

45:47.009 --> 45:49.479
And nobody's coming for us.

45:49.513 --> 45:51.748
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

45:51.781 --> 45:54.851
So won't you please?

45:54.884 --> 45:57.787
Look, it makes sense.

45:57.821 --> 46:00.690
We need all the help
we can get.

46:00.723 --> 46:02.058
Hello...

46:02.092 --> 46:04.061
Yeah, yeah,
wait, wait.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.130
I don't like this.

46:08.764 --> 46:10.134
We're gonna get outta here.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.505
We're gonna
make it, buddy.

46:14.538 --> 46:15.539
Thank you.

46:15.572 --> 46:17.508
Very much appreciated.

46:17.540 --> 46:20.076
All right,
grab some ammo.

46:20.110 --> 46:23.747
Let's get the hell
outta here.

46:23.779 --> 46:25.114
What about me?

46:25.147 --> 46:30.086
Hey! Hello!

46:30.119 --> 46:32.188
No.

46:32.221 --> 46:35.024
No weapon for you.

46:35.058 --> 46:37.594
Okay, great. No gun.

46:37.627 --> 46:39.696
Not that I need one.
I'm fine, just fine.

46:39.728 --> 46:42.632
Pfft, who needs a gun
in times like these?

46:42.665 --> 46:45.067
Let's move.

46:45.101 --> 46:47.938
Watch your backs.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.572
-Get over here.
-Move it.

46:49.605 --> 46:51.674
Hey! Stop pushing me, okay?

46:51.708 --> 46:53.778
Hey, quiet,
don't talk anymore.

46:59.982 --> 47:01.551
Man.

47:06.623 --> 47:07.724
All clear.

47:07.757 --> 47:09.793
Moving.

47:09.826 --> 47:11.161
Clear.

47:15.065 --> 47:16.667
-Stay close.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.039
Okay...

47:28.911 --> 47:30.080
Hey, o'Neil.

47:40.757 --> 47:42.226
-All clear.
-All right.

47:42.259 --> 47:44.628
Hey, are we there yet?

47:44.661 --> 47:45.996
Come on.

47:53.536 --> 47:55.004
Move, move.

48:00.777 --> 48:02.746
Cleared.

48:02.779 --> 48:04.748
Shit.

48:04.781 --> 48:08.685
The main entrance
must be around here somewhere.

48:08.717 --> 48:09.920
You guys really remind me

48:09.953 --> 48:12.221
of a former friend
of mine, bubba.

48:12.255 --> 48:15.192
Heard of him?
Great navigator.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.993
Jesus.

48:17.027 --> 48:18.295
Contact.

48:18.328 --> 48:19.795
What the fuck?

48:20.897 --> 48:22.032
Shit!

48:22.065 --> 48:26.168
Fuck, fuck!

48:26.201 --> 48:29.171
O'Neil!

48:29.205 --> 48:31.275
God, who did you eat?

48:35.177 --> 48:37.748
You smell like
a bag full of shit.

48:42.319 --> 48:43.853
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:52.194 --> 48:54.196
Fucking great...

48:54.230 --> 48:55.799
Brilliant.

48:55.831 --> 48:58.569
What?

48:58.601 --> 49:01.071
He's got my weapon,
you asshole.

49:01.103 --> 49:03.806
I'm very sorry
for saving your life.

49:03.839 --> 49:05.107
You're welcome,
but you know,

49:05.141 --> 49:07.278
that's how we handle
things in Germany.

49:28.665 --> 49:31.935
Okay...

49:31.967 --> 49:34.236
And...

49:34.270 --> 49:37.074
Nothing I haven't
already done.

49:37.107 --> 49:40.744
How cool!

49:40.777 --> 49:42.913
That's how we handle
things in the U.S.

49:42.946 --> 49:44.081
Amateur.

49:44.114 --> 49:45.616
Awesome!

49:45.648 --> 49:48.884
Hey, hey, can I have
a grenade too?

49:48.918 --> 49:51.188
Hey, come on.
Just a little one, please.

49:51.221 --> 49:53.791
Hey, I promise,
I'll only blow up Nazis?

50:16.078 --> 50:17.947
Somebody over there.

50:17.980 --> 50:19.982
Maybe the backup team.

50:20.016 --> 50:21.918
Sir, we have possibility
of survivors...

50:21.951 --> 50:23.253
It's about fucking time.

50:23.286 --> 50:25.355
Possibility of survivors.

50:25.388 --> 50:27.924
All right, stay put.
Stay quiet.

50:27.956 --> 50:29.326
Yes sir, we understand.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.994
This is lieutenant Taylor.
United States army

50:32.027 --> 50:33.129
with two other survivors.

50:33.163 --> 50:35.032
Radio was cut off.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.767
Hello?

50:36.799 --> 50:39.435
This is lieutenant Taylor
of the United States army.

50:39.469 --> 50:40.936
Anybody there?

50:40.969 --> 50:42.772
No, wait...

50:42.806 --> 50:46.710
No! No, Taylor!

50:51.047 --> 50:53.784
Watch out!

50:53.817 --> 50:55.318
Head down, head down.

50:55.351 --> 50:58.188
-Hey,
-sir, we have two survivors.

50:58.221 --> 51:00.757
Sir? Sir?
Do you copy?

51:00.790 --> 51:02.793
Do you copy?
We got two survivors.

51:05.494 --> 51:07.163
Get it off,
get it off me!

51:07.197 --> 51:09.066
Get it away from me!
Shoot it!

51:09.098 --> 51:12.334
Come on, come on, get down.
For once, listen to me.

51:13.402 --> 51:14.437
Okay.

51:19.342 --> 51:21.744
Sounds safe now.

51:21.777 --> 51:24.247
-You go first.
-Great.

51:29.252 --> 51:31.822
Okay.
You asked for it.

51:31.855 --> 51:33.757
No, no. Hold.

51:33.790 --> 51:35.425
Don't... don't shoot.
Stop.

51:41.297 --> 51:43.233
What?

51:43.266 --> 51:44.468
Don't ask.

51:44.500 --> 51:46.969
It's complicated.

51:48.837 --> 51:50.506
You gotta be kidding me.

51:50.540 --> 51:54.377
All available units,
seal the doors.

51:54.409 --> 51:57.714
Repeat, seal the doors.

52:05.388 --> 52:07.190
Hey, hey, hey!

52:07.223 --> 52:09.426
Open the door!
Hey! Come on!

52:09.458 --> 52:10.893
Come on!
Open the door!

52:10.927 --> 52:13.330
Hey, fuck! Fuck!

52:13.362 --> 52:16.198
Come on!

52:16.232 --> 52:18.034
I will burn you!

52:24.174 --> 52:27.177
Fuck.

52:27.210 --> 52:30.147
What the...

52:45.228 --> 52:47.397
Hey! What's wrong?

52:47.429 --> 52:49.398
Are you nuts?

52:49.431 --> 52:51.067
Okay,
please tell me

52:51.100 --> 52:52.835
that this is just
a military alarm clock.

52:56.839 --> 53:00.342
Shit.

53:00.375 --> 53:02.344
It's kind of a mini-nuke.

53:02.377 --> 53:04.847
In auto mode.

53:04.880 --> 53:05.848
What?

53:05.882 --> 53:07.150
Five kilotons.

53:07.183 --> 53:08.985
Enough to clean up
this mess here,

53:09.018 --> 53:11.588
but not enough to cause serious
trouble on the outside.

53:11.621 --> 53:12.956
It's an a-bomb.

53:12.989 --> 53:14.424
Come on.
You're kidding me.

53:14.456 --> 53:16.092
They can't blow up
an a-bomb.

53:16.125 --> 53:18.195
We are in Germany.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.831
Yes, they can.
Quit pissing your pants.

53:20.864 --> 53:24.434
It's gonna fry us but won't
damage the structure.

53:24.467 --> 53:25.969
Okay, great.

53:26.002 --> 53:29.840
You just got fucked
by your own people.

53:29.873 --> 53:34.945
I guess they fucked
both of us.

53:34.978 --> 53:36.880
Yeah...

53:36.913 --> 53:39.882
Is that supposed to make us
partners in crime or something?

53:39.915 --> 53:41.984
Come on. Stop it.
Turn it off?

53:45.087 --> 53:47.189
No way.

53:47.223 --> 53:51.027
No use in trying.

53:51.060 --> 53:53.029
Getting out isn't
very likely now, is it?

53:56.299 --> 53:58.201
Fucking bastards!

54:15.051 --> 54:18.221
I'm sorry.

54:18.253 --> 54:22.292
Why?

54:22.324 --> 54:24.627
It's not your fault.

54:24.661 --> 54:27.063
We're expendable.

54:27.096 --> 54:30.166
Nobody cares.

54:30.199 --> 54:34.503
Yeah, but you wouldn't be
down here without me.

54:37.339 --> 54:40.943
Okay.
Now that you reminded me.

54:40.976 --> 54:45.514
It was your fault.

54:45.547 --> 54:47.484
Let's wait
for the big bang.

54:47.516 --> 54:50.052
We won't feel anything
so close to it.

54:50.085 --> 54:51.353
I don't like
that option.

54:51.386 --> 54:52.621
Try to live with it.

54:52.654 --> 54:54.223
You mean, "die with it."

54:54.257 --> 54:55.492
Whatever.

55:14.743 --> 55:17.079
Funny how it all ends?

55:17.112 --> 55:19.382
Fantastic.

55:23.552 --> 55:25.621
-What?
-My name is Markus.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.694
Debby.

55:42.337 --> 55:44.006
I was on my way
to go swimming

55:44.040 --> 55:46.442
when the order came in.

55:46.476 --> 55:48.445
I could be there right now
with my friends, you know?

55:48.478 --> 55:50.447
What did you say?

55:50.480 --> 55:52.581
Swimming, drinking good
bavarian beer.

55:52.614 --> 55:54.283
-Swimming?
-All that stuff.

55:58.487 --> 56:00.089
Schwimmen?

56:01.357 --> 56:03.192
I know a way out!

56:03.226 --> 56:05.362
What? Where?

56:05.395 --> 56:08.297
-Downstairs.
-You're kidding me, right?

56:08.331 --> 56:10.100
Do I look like I'm kidding?

56:10.132 --> 56:12.034
Come on, soldier.
Let's go.

56:14.337 --> 56:16.005
They told us all
the passages through here

56:16.038 --> 56:17.506
are blocked
or something.

56:17.540 --> 56:19.074
I'm not talking about
the passages.

56:19.107 --> 56:21.176
How do you think
I got in here?

56:21.210 --> 56:22.512
You've got
to trust me, Debby.

56:24.679 --> 56:25.581
Okay.

56:26.681 --> 56:29.485
Lead the way,
big boy.

56:29.518 --> 56:32.455
Okay.

56:32.487 --> 56:34.590
No problem.

56:34.623 --> 56:36.225
We can make it
in time.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.730
And find the way easy.

56:43.833 --> 56:45.368
Are you okay?

56:45.400 --> 56:46.669
Don't ask.

57:05.788 --> 57:07.523
By the way,

57:07.556 --> 57:10.292
did I tell you
that I love women in uniform?

57:10.326 --> 57:12.262
When this is over,
I'II Chuck it in.

57:14.230 --> 57:16.400
Behind you!

57:21.237 --> 57:23.706
Okay. Eat this,
Nazi shitbag!

57:23.739 --> 57:26.576
And this!
And this!

57:30.279 --> 57:31.715
It's die-day.

57:39.288 --> 57:41.391
-You okay?
-Don't I look okay?

57:43.759 --> 57:46.596
Just watch your back
next time, okay?

57:46.628 --> 57:47.697
Yeah, right.

57:51.333 --> 57:52.734
You sure
we're heading the right way?

57:52.768 --> 57:54.771
Sure as hell. There, left.

57:59.342 --> 58:00.410
Clear.

58:07.449 --> 58:09.886
God damn.
Not Paul.

58:09.918 --> 58:12.554
-You knew him?
-Yeah.

58:12.587 --> 58:13.622
Poor bastard.

58:13.656 --> 58:14.657
What...!

58:23.598 --> 58:27.136
Markus! Markus! Help!
Get away from me.

58:27.170 --> 58:28.605
Women.

58:28.638 --> 58:31.473
Leave them alone
for two seconds and...

58:31.507 --> 58:33.309
Okay, hold on, Debby,
I'm coming.

58:33.342 --> 58:35.744
Contact!

58:44.786 --> 58:46.288
Now get to the chopper.

58:49.824 --> 58:52.728
You okay?

58:52.761 --> 58:53.863
You look okay.

58:57.266 --> 58:59.235
You can thank me later.
Let's go.

58:59.268 --> 59:00.737
Markus!

59:00.770 --> 59:03.139
What the...?

59:09.679 --> 59:12.415
Let go of... let go of my head!
Come on, now!

59:24.893 --> 59:27.363
What a dumbass.

59:48.583 --> 59:50.386
Does this mean
I get your phone number?

59:52.020 --> 59:53.855
No.

59:53.889 --> 59:56.359
Okay. But you know this?

59:56.391 --> 59:58.660
It's a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

59:58.694 --> 01:00:00.462
Which way now?

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.665
Left.

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.000
I really hope
the exit is there.

01:00:04.032 --> 01:00:05.768
I'm starting
to get used to you.

01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:07.703
That's my legendary
charisma, you know.

01:00:15.543 --> 01:00:17.679
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:00:17.712 --> 01:00:20.949
This looks familiar to me. Yeah.

01:00:20.982 --> 01:00:23.252
Hey, there.
The door.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.388
We're almost there.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.257
The good thing is, I didn't come
across any zombies down here

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:30.259
-when I came in.
-Let's hope so.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.527
We're running out
of ammo.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.330
Hey, trust me.

01:00:39.668 --> 01:00:41.337
Hold this!
Hold this!

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:43.272
Shit!
Give me your grenade.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.708
Give me your grenade.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:49.344
Shit!

01:00:49.377 --> 01:00:51.447
Go! Go, go, go, go!

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.755
Hey.

01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:02.525
Man, that was pretty close.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.793
Yeah, it ain't that easy.

01:01:06.828 --> 01:01:09.631
What the hell...?

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:10.967
No, no, no, no!
Watch... watch it!

01:01:15.503 --> 01:01:16.906
Fuck you!

01:01:21.976 --> 01:01:23.446
What?

01:01:23.478 --> 01:01:24.547
Never mind.

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:28.884
You know,
that was our way out.

01:01:30.118 --> 01:01:31.953
Fuck!

01:01:31.987 --> 01:01:33.489
Don't you know
another way?

01:01:33.522 --> 01:01:34.824
No, that's the only one.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.460
Shit!

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:38.960
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea.

01:01:38.993 --> 01:01:40.662
Step back.

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.665
Watch and learn,
soldier.

01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:57.846
Man, I'm good.

01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:01.783
-Poser.
-Come on.

01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:03.920
Don't you girls
like smart men?

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:05.922
Yeah.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.090
-Wait.
-What's wrong?

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:13.862
Wrong place, in the
wrong time, pal?

01:02:13.895 --> 01:02:15.098
You think?

01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:22.504
Okay.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.773
Looks like
everything's clear in here.

01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:27.009
Look for some stairs down.

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.511
That's the way.

01:02:30.679 --> 01:02:31.981
Sure.

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.850
Almost there.

01:02:33.882 --> 01:02:35.752
Fuck.

01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:38.087
What? Not...
Not again. Run! Run!

01:02:38.119 --> 01:02:39.788
Go on, run!

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.024
Run, Debby!

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:48.630
Debby, back!

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.971
There's more.
Run, down, down!

01:02:57.873 --> 01:03:00.543
Debby, run!
Run, they're coming!

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.612
Come on, Debby.

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.413
Where's your fucking exit?

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.849
-I'm running out of ammo.
-We're close.

01:03:06.882 --> 01:03:08.717
You said that a minute ago.

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.623
Fuck!
There are too many of them.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.630
What? Why don't they attack?

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.465
Batteries not included?

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:25.701
Heil Hitler!

01:03:25.734 --> 01:03:27.869
No.

01:03:27.902 --> 01:03:31.506
Fuck it.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.176
-He's mine.
-Okay.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:41.684
Fuck!

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:44.821
Man. Against. Man.
Mein. Führer!

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:48.858
Not fair.

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:49.859
Markus!

01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:51.694
Fuck!

01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:52.862
Eat this!

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:56.165
Debby! No! No!

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.903
Fuck!

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.143
Get back here, come on!
Come on, you pussy.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.212
Come on.
You scared?

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:10.779
You scared,
you little shit?

01:04:22.123 --> 01:04:24.893
You suck!

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:29.931
Drop dead.

01:04:29.964 --> 01:04:31.199
That's it!
That's it!

01:04:31.232 --> 01:04:33.869
Now I'm really pissed.

01:04:33.902 --> 01:04:35.237
Yes.

01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:47.484
Come on,
drop dead.

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:55.958
Okay. You want me to go
Chuck Norris on you?

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:11.706
Get back here,
you coward.

01:05:11.739 --> 01:05:13.975
Come on,
you coward.

01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:16.045
Fuck it.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.746
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

01:05:17.779 --> 01:05:20.215
Debby?
Debby? Hey.

01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:21.783
Where is he?

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.252
I'm planning his downfall.

01:05:23.284 --> 01:05:25.554
Forget him.
Move.

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:28.123
I almost got him.

01:05:28.156 --> 01:05:29.691
Come on. This way.

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.630
Okay.
Now listen, Debby.

01:05:34.663 --> 01:05:37.132
You have to dive
as long as you can.

01:05:37.165 --> 01:05:39.634
-Just don't stop.
-What?

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:41.070
Debby, you have to go now.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.605
Forget it.

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:43.973
The bomb will blow up
any second.

01:05:44.005 --> 01:05:46.007
I'm not going to leave you.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.676
Watch out.

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.614
-Call me.
-No!

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:59.688
Okay, Adolf,
you filthy pig.

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:05.694
Looks... Like... You
Lost again, mein führer!

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:12.668
Okay, blondie, come on.
Come to daddy.

01:06:13.835 --> 01:06:15.071
Crap.

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:26.248
Markus?

01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:29.118
Markus, come on, man.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.020
Come on.
You all right?

01:06:34.022 --> 01:06:36.592
We made it, man.
We made it.

01:06:38.092 --> 01:06:39.928
Step back, soldier.
We're here to handle it.

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.063
I got him.

01:06:51.973 --> 01:06:53.676
We're good to go.

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.176
Package ready
to be delivered.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.280
We're moving out now.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.125
Choppers, are you
ready for takeoff?

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:23.272
What the...?

01:07:23.304 --> 01:07:26.141
-Doctor, he's awake.
-Here. Hold this.

01:07:38.052 --> 01:07:40.121
What about that fat guy
in the car?

01:07:40.154 --> 01:07:41.790
On the run.
He left the car empty.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.225
They're searching
the area.

01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:45.895
It's only a matter of time
till they find him.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:48.397
I want him contained
as soon as possible.

01:07:48.429 --> 01:07:51.100
Yes, sir.
And he had this on him.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.407
What's her condition?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.811
She's gonna be fine.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.880
-Leave us.
-Yes, sir.

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:20.194
Garbage.

01:08:20.228 --> 01:08:23.999
You know, history
is not written in ink.

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:28.036
It's written in blood.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.106
I'm going to ask you once.

01:08:30.138 --> 01:08:32.274
The name of the location
of your collaborator?

01:08:35.042 --> 01:08:38.447
Come closer. Closer.

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:41.183
Closer.

01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:56.430
Last chance.

01:08:56.464 --> 01:09:00.136
Where is your
collaborator?

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.337
I'm telling you once.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.305
Fuck you.

01:09:04.337 --> 01:09:06.942
And fuck
your fucking army.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.479
Your choice.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.988
No. No!

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.389
You killed him!

01:09:23.424 --> 01:09:24.926
No.

01:09:24.959 --> 01:09:27.529
I authorized myself
to execute him.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:29.029
And you.

01:09:32.066 --> 01:09:33.935
What the fuck?

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:36.805
He was recording
everything, you morons!

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:39.240
Find that fat fuck
and bring me those tapes.

01:09:39.273 --> 01:09:42.243
Yes, sir.
Move, move, move, move, move!

01:09:42.276 --> 01:09:43.812
Fuck!

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.829
Okay, you can start
with the other one.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.368
What the hell is this?

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:42.137
What are you
talking about?

01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:44.940
"Made in Germany."
Crazy.

01:10:44.972 --> 01:10:46.542
Come on,
give it to me.

01:10:48.009 --> 01:10:49.411
Let's see.

01:10:52.179 --> 01:10:54.883
Looks like a camera.
Say "cheese."

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.585
You're on can...
Shit! What... what?

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.230
Adolf was fucking blind.

01:11:08.262 --> 01:11:10.531
Hey, look at
the lens, man.

01:11:10.565 --> 01:11:12.134
Why are you here again?

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.968
Because I'm a believer.

01:11:14.002 --> 01:11:16.405
The only person on this planet
still listening to you.

01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:20.375
Hey, and because
of your hot sister.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.677
Hey, are you sure
you got this right?

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:23.378
I mean,
I can't read shit here,

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:25.380
and I am German.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.249
Sure, I'm sure.

01:11:27.281 --> 01:11:29.051
I've been studying it
for months.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:32.087
The reichsgold
is closer than ever.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.423
Cool. And what about
those secret weapons,

01:11:34.455 --> 01:11:37.159
neu schwabenland,
aliens, ufos?

01:11:37.191 --> 01:11:39.494
Bullshit.
Nothing but myths.

01:11:39.527 --> 01:11:43.231
Constructed to deflect
the truth about the gold.

01:11:43.264 --> 01:11:45.167
Yeah, but the website
says it's true.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.536
I mean,
what if it is true?

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.304
It isn't. None of it.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.943
Whatever is hidden
in these caves,

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.544
I'll find it.

01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:57.378
Sicko.

01:11:57.411 --> 01:11:59.714
Hey, bubba,
when is this suit ready?

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.583
I need action.

01:12:01.615 --> 01:12:03.518
Two weeks at least.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:06.221
Two more weeks?
Come on.

01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:08.457
The suit and the camera
are prototypes.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.626
It takes time, okay?

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:12.628
All right.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.262
They why don't
you stop eating

01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:15.630
and start working,
bubba?

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.401
Or is it already bubba fat?

01:12:21.436 --> 01:12:23.739
-Let me explain...
-Hey, tell them about your father.

01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:25.640
What?

01:12:25.673 --> 01:12:28.176
Tell them about your father,
the army, the coverup.

01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:29.444
-All the cool stuff.
-Man.

01:12:29.477 --> 01:12:31.612
Can you just shut the fuck up?

01:12:31.646 --> 01:12:33.514
And tell them
about your hot sister.

01:12:33.548 --> 01:12:35.451
Hey, leave my sister
out of this.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.353
Good.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:42.691
This book is the diary
of Jacob Stein.

01:12:42.723 --> 01:12:45.159
He's a Jewish prisoner
with the dachau

01:12:45.192 --> 01:12:49.163
working the messerschmitt
caves in oberammergau.

01:12:49.196 --> 01:12:51.232
Wait. That's important.
I have to capture that.

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:53.602
What...
What're you doing?

01:12:53.634 --> 01:12:55.036
Close ups, details...

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.338
What any good director
would do...

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.672
No, no, no.
Hold on a sec.

01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:59.540
You're not
the director. I am.

01:12:59.574 --> 01:13:01.410
Listen,
you're the cameraman,

01:13:01.442 --> 01:13:05.446
and therefore, you got nothing to say.
Okay? Got it?

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.581
Got it.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.117
But this diary is important.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.618
Its old.
It tells a secret.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.320
It's the key to tons of gold.

01:13:11.352 --> 01:13:13.588
We have to show it,
okay?

01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:16.424
Boobies. Cool.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.427
But are you sure
this diary is legit?

01:13:18.459 --> 01:13:22.330
No. I got it on ebay.
Of course it is.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.032
Hey fatso, what
if there's still some

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.634
secret old Nazi stuff
down there,

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.535
or... or even better,

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:31.307
an old community just like those
weird Nazis from the moon?

01:13:33.174 --> 01:13:35.110
Just saying...

01:13:35.142 --> 01:13:37.612
Okay, I m recording.

01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:39.715
Okay, great.

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:42.484
Now, this is
the outer fence.

01:13:42.517 --> 01:13:45.554
Beyond it, it's all military
and restricted and shit.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:48.257
But im working on a way
to get you in.

01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:50.625
Then we II get you
to the upper dam.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.628
Upper dam. Got it.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.163
And if Stein's
diary is correct,

01:13:55.196 --> 01:13:57.532
you II find the secret entrance
to the Nazi base there.

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.435
Yeah! And tons
of Nazi-gold.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.637
We're gonna be rich, man,
fucking rich!

01:14:04.138 --> 01:14:05.574
They are now entering
the tunnel system

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:07.575
that was part
of the messerschmitt caves.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.277
They used the tunnels
as storage sites

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.146
-for the airplane parts.
-Okay, cool.

01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:12.780
And I have to admit
they were smart.

01:14:12.813 --> 01:14:14.650
Real smart.

01:14:14.682 --> 01:14:16.851
They drove fully loaded
trucks into the tunnels.

01:14:16.884 --> 01:14:19.320
And on the other side
they drove out

01:14:19.353 --> 01:14:21.255
-with empty ones.
-Okay.

01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:22.758
That's how they fooled
the allied air surveillance

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.592
for years.

01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:27.295
Okay, and they did the same
with all the gold?

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.164
Yes, I think so.

01:14:29.196 --> 01:14:31.165
Officially the gold
was to be transported

01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.835
to Hitler's eagle's nest
in the alps.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.605
But it was never found.

01:14:36.637 --> 01:14:39.273
Thomas, its cold
and it's wet.

01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:42.777
-I can t see shit...
-We're here, okay?

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:47.616
This is the only publicly
accessible part of the caves.

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:52.187
And here...

01:14:52.219 --> 01:14:55.490
Wanna know what's on
the other side?

01:14:55.523 --> 01:14:57.625
The gold?

01:14:57.659 --> 01:15:01.396
Right behind this rock
are tons and tons of Nazi gold

01:15:01.428 --> 01:15:03.498
waiting to be found!

01:15:03.531 --> 01:15:05.766
-That s the idea.
-Shit, man.

01:15:05.799 --> 01:15:07.602
Great.
Take the cam, bubba.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:10.239
Okay. Give me that. Right.

01:15:12.874 --> 01:15:15.577
Hey, why can't we
just blow up this wall?

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:17.779
Why... why...
Why go all the way around?

01:15:17.812 --> 01:15:19.348
That's a much easier way
to get in.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.648
Forget it.

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:21.884
The army would be here
in no time.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.919
And by the way,
I'm not a terrorist.

01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:27.522
I don t have a shitload
of dynamite in my basement.

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.292
Come on, let s go.
There s more to see outside.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.830
Are you sure
it's a smart idea

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:39.268
to sneak in a U.S. army base
in the middle of the night?

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.803
Do you see any guards?

01:15:41.835 --> 01:15:44.873
No, not yet.

01:15:44.905 --> 01:15:47.708
I cant see a thing.

01:15:47.741 --> 01:15:49.343
Let me switch on
the cam-light.

01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:51.946
No, the guards would see it.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.648
You said there
weren't any guards.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:57.352
Over there, no.
Over here, yes.

01:15:57.384 --> 01:15:59.253
I did my research.

01:15:59.286 --> 01:16:02.691
I've been here with my dad
a thousand times.

01:16:02.723 --> 01:16:05.927
Fuck! Guards! Run!

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.530
I'm running!
Shit. Look, I'm running.

01:16:08.562 --> 01:16:11.900
The car, get in the car!
Run, run, run!

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:18.973
Shit! You...
You fucking asshole!

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.677
You goddamn...

01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:25.813
I just wanted to get you
a little workout.

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.750
Not funny.
