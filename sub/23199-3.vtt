01:57.103 --> 01:59.606
Boy, it must be a hot one.
The middle of the night-

01:59.690 --> 02:01.861
Middle of the night
in Washington, D.C., Steve.

02:01.944 --> 02:04.531
It's 1:00 p. m. in Moscow,
12:00 noon in Tokyo...

02:04.614 --> 02:06.534
and 11:00 a. m. in Dar es Salaam.

02:06.617 --> 02:08.538
10:00 a. m. in Dar es Salaam, Joe.

02:08.621 --> 02:10.749
10:00 a. m. in Dar es Salaam.
My point exactly.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.671
Once, just once,
I'd like to get them out of bed.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.560
...one, zero.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.421
You are watching the last lift-off...

02:40.504 --> 02:43.174
supervised by Dr. Kenneth Wilson.

02:44.927 --> 02:49.184
This, as you probably know,
is Dr. Wilson enjoying that event.

02:49.935 --> 02:54.484
For 14 years, Dr. Wilson
led that portion of our space program...

02:54.693 --> 02:57.656
Which determined who an astronaut was...

02:57.740 --> 03:01.704
and what had to be within his brain
if he were to get to the moon...

03:01.829 --> 03:03.457
which we accomplished.

03:04.208 --> 03:05.668
And more.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.006
But he's retired now, sir.

03:08.089 --> 03:10.384
A man's mind doesn't retire, Joe.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.637
Don't we ha ve a general update, Diana?

03:12.721 --> 03:15.225
Yes, we do.
When he left government service...

03:15.309 --> 03:17.729
he joined
the Washington Institute of Research.

03:17.812 --> 03:21.484
More recently he's gone even
deeper into his studies of the mind...

03:21.569 --> 03:25.158
become convinced that matter itself
can be moved by brain waves.

03:25.241 --> 03:26.994
Psychokinesis.

03:27.494 --> 03:30.708
Then it's possibly an even graver situation.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.169
How do you mean, sir?

03:32.252 --> 03:36.175
One hour and 15 minutes ago,
Dr. Wilson, his assistant...

03:36.258 --> 03:40.932
and a third man vanished from his offices
in the Washington Institute of Research...

03:41.016 --> 03:42.602
Without a trace.

04:00.087 --> 04:02.758
This place looks like it
was hit by a cyclone.

04:02.841 --> 04:05.888
- What time did you discover this?
- At 0300 hours, sir.

04:05.971 --> 04:09.602
I heard a loud noise in this room
when I was in the one directly below it.

04:09.685 --> 04:12.148
It must have been this bookcase falling.

04:13.399 --> 04:15.862
Boy, it'd take five men
to knock that thing over.

04:15.945 --> 04:19.993
When I checked earlier, the only people
in the room were Dr. Wilson, Mr. Ishida...

04:20.076 --> 04:21.913
and Mr. Taft, Dr. Wilson's assistant.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.081
Who's Ishida?

04:23.165 --> 04:26.253
He's been working with Dr. Wilson
the last three months.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.714
Japanese national?

04:27.797 --> 04:30.301
His clearance came
from the Japanese embassy.

04:30.384 --> 04:32.888
He's a landscape artist
conscripted by Dr. Wilson...

04:32.972 --> 04:35.100
with some kind of ESP or something.

04:38.272 --> 04:39.941
What time did they check in?

04:40.025 --> 04:41.778
At 0130 hours, miss.

04:42.487 --> 04:45.241
Is it possible that they could have
used some other exit?

04:45.325 --> 04:48.914
No, miss. We have every exit covered
24 hours a day.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.876
The grounds are crisscrossed
with laser beams.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.758
If anyone walked across the grass
without checking in, we'd nail them.

04:58.345 --> 05:00.223
Dice, cards, boxes...

05:00.974 --> 05:03.061
all instruments for checking ESP.

05:03.728 --> 05:07.902
It's hard to believe man's going to move
mountains with his mind someday.

05:08.277 --> 05:09.488
Who's to say?

05:09.571 --> 05:13.035
They laughed at the Wright Brothers
until their plane took off.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.789
How do you suppose they got out of here?

05:17.666 --> 05:18.752
What's that?

05:18.835 --> 05:21.631
That's the alarm bell
to the basement storage vault.

05:21.715 --> 05:23.551
It can only be activated from within.

05:23.635 --> 05:26.764
If somebody's trapped in there,
we can't open it until 8:00 a. m.

05:26.847 --> 05:29.352
- A time lock? Who installed it?
- Headly and Billings.

05:29.435 --> 05:32.774
Get them on the phone,
get a technician over here right away.

05:39.117 --> 05:41.537
Please, hurry. I'm suffocating.

05:41.621 --> 05:44.249
You're not suffocating.
There's plenty of air in there.

05:44.334 --> 05:46.420
Just breathe slow and easy.

05:46.587 --> 05:48.173
I suffer from claustrophobia.

05:48.256 --> 05:51.010
I can't stand being confined.

05:51.512 --> 05:52.721
I can't breathe!

05:52.805 --> 05:55.351
Relax, will you?
I know what you're going through.

05:55.434 --> 05:57.938
We've got an expert on his way here
to get you out.

05:58.021 --> 06:00.859
And we will get you out.
Just conserve your energy.

06:01.193 --> 06:02.278
I'll try.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.990
All right. Don't worry. We'll be right here.

06:05.826 --> 06:08.079
Good, then I can tell them
you're on your way?

06:08.162 --> 06:09.373
Thank you.

06:21.058 --> 06:23.395
Even with the technician,
it's going to take time.

06:23.478 --> 06:24.897
He may be running out of time.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.526
Sounds like he's about
30 seconds from shock.

06:27.902 --> 06:29.905
- Wonder Woman.
- Hi, Steve. Can I help?

06:29.988 --> 06:33.119
- You sure can, but how did you know?
- Later. What's the problem?

06:33.202 --> 06:35.914
We've got to get this vault open.
There's a man in there.

06:35.997 --> 06:39.044
- It's a time lock. We have a technician-
- Don't worry.

07:02.998 --> 07:05.460
All right, okay. It's all over now.

07:05.627 --> 07:08.173
You'll be all right.
Here, sit in this chair.

07:10.635 --> 07:12.805
Maybe you'd better take it from here,
Steve.

07:12.888 --> 07:15.101
Okay, but what if we need your help
on this one?

07:15.184 --> 07:17.104
I won't be far away.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.818
You all right, pal? What happened?

07:20.901 --> 07:22.988
You were with Dr. Wilson
tonight, weren't you?

07:23.071 --> 07:24.365
Very briefly.

07:24.490 --> 07:27.662
I was working next door
to Dr. Wilson's office...

07:27.745 --> 07:29.707
where he conducts his experiments...

07:29.790 --> 07:32.127
when I heard this noise, like a thump...

07:32.210 --> 07:34.381
on the wall between our rooms.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.676
I didn't think much about it then...

07:36.759 --> 07:40.223
until I heard something
really loud fall to the floor.

07:40.890 --> 07:45.273
I went next door, I didn't even knock.
I just walked in, and...

07:45.815 --> 07:47.693
- And what?
- I don't know.

07:49.947 --> 07:53.744
All of a sudden,
someone, something grabbed me...

07:55.747 --> 07:58.209
turned me around
and put something over my mouth.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.380
I tried to turn around, but I couldn't.

08:00.463 --> 08:02.717
Then, the next thing I knew,
I was down here...

08:02.800 --> 08:04.511
the vault door opened...

08:04.594 --> 08:07.975
and I was shoved in there,
and then the door slammed shut.

08:08.225 --> 08:10.771
Why didn't you sound the alarm earlier?

08:10.896 --> 08:12.482
I guess I blacked out.

08:12.566 --> 08:16.321
As I said, I can't take
confinement, darkness...

08:16.405 --> 08:19.117
But, Mr. Taft, there is no way
to open that vault door.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.911
Then you tell me how I got in there.

08:20.996 --> 08:23.124
It's all right.
We're not doubting your word.

08:23.207 --> 08:26.379
But can you tell us anything
about what happened to Dr. Wilson...

08:26.462 --> 08:27.965
and this man, Ishida?

08:28.048 --> 08:31.094
No, I didn't see a thing.
But have you looked at the tapes?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.429
What tape?

08:32.513 --> 08:35.309
Dr. Wilson always
kept cameras in his lab...

08:35.393 --> 08:38.565
to make tapes of his experiments,
for his records.

08:38.648 --> 08:39.982
Like this one?

08:40.066 --> 08:41.152
Where did you find it?

08:41.235 --> 08:44.282
I had a look around.
But there's no playback machine...

08:44.365 --> 08:45.868
probably for security reasons.

08:45.951 --> 08:46.994
What happened here?

08:47.077 --> 08:49.623
He was trapped in the vault.
Wonder Woman got him out.

08:49.707 --> 08:51.168
- Wonder Woman?
- Yeah.

08:51.251 --> 08:52.503
That's amazing.

08:52.628 --> 08:54.173
She usually is.

08:54.298 --> 08:56.509
We better get this tape to the office.

08:56.593 --> 08:59.221
There's so much to do.
Why don't we divide up this job?

08:59.306 --> 09:00.473
Good idea.

09:00.557 --> 09:03.228
I will visit Wilson's family and Ishida.

09:03.312 --> 09:04.898
I found his address in the files.

09:04.981 --> 09:07.484
Good. See you later. Thanks for your help.

09:07.568 --> 09:09.571
Are you sure you're all right?

09:10.740 --> 09:13.411
I just need rest, lots of rest.

09:14.495 --> 09:16.623
I know my story sounds incredible.

09:16.916 --> 09:18.461
But you were in the vault.

09:27.015 --> 09:28.851
That should do it.

09:29.686 --> 09:31.355
Start the tape, please.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.174
Concentrate.

09:54.016 --> 09:55.769
It won't move.

09:55.977 --> 09:57.563
I am not strong enough.

09:57.646 --> 10:00.485
Yes, you are, Ishida. You can move it.

10:00.568 --> 10:03.865
You must let the brain wave
amplifier help you.

10:03.948 --> 10:06.327
Now, try again, and concentrate.

10:09.081 --> 10:10.541
Concentrate harder.

10:16.301 --> 10:19.347
There, you see? You did it.

10:19.431 --> 10:20.724
I did it.

10:20.933 --> 10:22.310
Now, try harder.

10:25.023 --> 10:26.442
Concentrate.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.506
Eleven!

10:44.970 --> 10:46.181
Try again.

10:55.028 --> 10:56.238
Seven!

11:04.292 --> 11:05.503
Eleven!

11:05.669 --> 11:08.341
Now, we must try something else.

11:09.342 --> 11:12.013
A book. Any book.

11:34.548 --> 11:35.716
A chair!

11:36.218 --> 11:38.513
I knew we could do it!

11:42.435 --> 11:45.524
Now, let's see, I have to call the Pentagon.

11:45.607 --> 11:48.069
This is an incredible breakthrough.

12:08.059 --> 12:10.270
You will not call anyone.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.025
You made this machine for me.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.861
I will take it.

12:14.945 --> 12:19.326
Not the Pentagon, and not your precious
United States Government.

12:19.786 --> 12:22.331
But you don't understand.
We're not stopping here.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.919
We have to keep working, perfecting.

12:25.002 --> 12:26.505
There is no time, Doctor.

12:26.588 --> 12:30.177
I have a use for this,
and it is not in a lab.

12:30.636 --> 12:34.016
You mean you want to use this
for personal gain?

12:35.978 --> 12:38.398
Then I will have to stop you!

12:46.244 --> 12:47.579
Ishida!

12:47.663 --> 12:49.666
I don't want to hurt you.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.171
But I will have this machine.

13:04.773 --> 13:06.943
What's the matter with the picture?

13:07.944 --> 13:11.116
It looks as though
Ishida concentrated so hard...

13:11.324 --> 13:13.829
his mind disrupted the picture.

13:14.079 --> 13:17.084
In view of what we've just seen,
I'd say anything's possible.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.671
And this man's on the loose
with this awesome power.

16:45.576 --> 16:48.456
You see? They're already looking for you.

16:48.539 --> 16:50.459
You'd better give yourself up.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.878
He is an agent.

16:52.295 --> 16:54.048
Yes, I would imagine so.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.886
If necessary, I will handle him.

16:57.970 --> 16:59.891
You have given me the means.

17:08.863 --> 17:10.657
Doctor, I warn you.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.704
This is no time to test your machine.

17:13.996 --> 17:17.292
I do not want to hurt you,
or the man out there.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.011
Hello, anybody home?

17:38.118 --> 17:41.623
Wonder Woman!
Well, you said you wouldn't be far away.

17:41.915 --> 17:43.501
Wonder Woman.

17:45.921 --> 17:47.298
Strange.

17:47.674 --> 17:48.801
Fire!

17:50.135 --> 17:52.932
Long years, meaningless years.

17:54.643 --> 17:58.732
And then, within few hours,
it all comes together.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.407
I don't understand. Who is she?

18:03.699 --> 18:05.410
It is not important.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.872
But you sound as if you knew her.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.667
I know of her.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.005
I expected to find Diana Prince here...

18:13.089 --> 18:15.509
but I suppose she's still
with Dr. Wilson's family.

18:15.592 --> 18:17.762
Steve, I want to show you something.

18:25.275 --> 18:28.445
Well, what do you know?
This doll is a collector's item.

18:28.529 --> 18:32.369
I know, only a few sold during
the Second World War, for charity.

18:32.995 --> 18:36.709
Must be worth a fortune today.
Do you know this man, Ishida?

18:36.792 --> 18:38.878
Not at all, I just did some eavesdropping...

18:38.962 --> 18:41.842
when you were talking
to the security officer. Why?

18:42.134 --> 18:45.222
Well, he obviously
has some kind of an interest in you.

18:45.347 --> 18:46.683
Obviously.

18:47.350 --> 18:48.978
I don't like it.

18:49.061 --> 18:52.733
The Japanese have a custom
of setting aside one room for the dead.

18:53.235 --> 18:56.490
They usually have a small shrine
or pictures of the deceased...

18:56.574 --> 18:59.912
covered with a black ribbon
or cloth of some kind.

19:00.162 --> 19:01.539
Like these?

19:03.501 --> 19:04.711
Yes.

19:06.088 --> 19:09.093
- Does he look at all familiar to you?
- No, not at all.

19:10.929 --> 19:12.557
It's a picture of you.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.259
Actually, Miss Prince, I haven't spoken
to Mr. Ishida for over a month.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.389
He's supposed to be on vacation to Tokyo.

19:38.931 --> 19:41.059
But he should be back by now.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.023
However, he may be delayed.

19:44.398 --> 19:47.319
Are you sure he is the man
you're looking for?

19:47.570 --> 19:48.697
Yes.

19:48.780 --> 19:52.076
And you wish to find
the young man shown in this picture?

19:52.161 --> 19:53.829
I think it could help us a lot.

19:54.914 --> 19:58.170
This photograph was made
on old Fujika paper.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.506
That would be before the war.

20:02.677 --> 20:06.183
So, these are the microfilms...

20:06.850 --> 20:10.272
for the years 1925...

20:10.355 --> 20:12.233
to 1940.

20:13.485 --> 20:16.323
These are the visas.
I'm sorry there are so many.

20:16.406 --> 20:17.658
I'll manage.

20:19.161 --> 20:20.163
Thank you.

20:20.246 --> 20:23.292
To operate this microfilm machine
is very simple-

20:23.375 --> 20:25.546
I've used one before, thank you.

20:26.630 --> 20:28.133
Yes, of course.

20:29.635 --> 20:34.018
If you wish for me to do some translation,
feel free to call on me.

20:34.226 --> 20:35.352
Thank you.

21:28.936 --> 21:32.859
Diana's over at the Japanese Embassy,
trying to track down that photo...

21:32.942 --> 21:34.695
you and Wonder Woman turned up.

21:34.988 --> 21:38.577
I've put out an APB
on Dr. Wilson and Ishida.

21:38.660 --> 21:41.122
But so far, there's been no response.

21:43.877 --> 21:45.338
What's wrong, Steve?

21:48.550 --> 21:50.679
"Steve, I've developed
a lead on Dr. Wilson.

21:50.763 --> 21:52.682
"You must fly to Los Alamos immediately.

21:52.766 --> 21:56.230
"I'll meet you at the Mountain View Inn,
near the old proving grounds.

21:56.313 --> 21:57.482
"Wonder Woman."

21:57.565 --> 21:59.443
I wonder how that got in my typewriter.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.738
I don't know, but I could check it out.

22:01.821 --> 22:05.160
If Wonder Woman typed it,
someone would have reported seeing her.

22:05.243 --> 22:06.788
You could hardly miss her.

22:07.998 --> 22:11.504
When she wants to, she can move so fast,
she's practically invisible.

22:11.879 --> 22:13.924
- Except...
- Except what?

22:14.174 --> 22:16.511
Well, she's never contacted me
that way before.

22:21.143 --> 22:23.898
- Are you going to meet her?
- You bet I am.

22:24.106 --> 22:27.070
Check in at I.A.D.C. Regional
when you get there, will you?

22:28.196 --> 22:29.406
Will do.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.828
The family name is the same: Ishida.

22:33.162 --> 22:36.125
Could they be related to the man
who works with Dr. Wilson?

22:37.126 --> 22:39.839
This family is listed as deceased.

22:40.298 --> 22:43.762
There is no mention
of any known living relatives.

22:44.472 --> 22:45.973
Does it say how they died?

22:46.057 --> 22:48.061
The parents died of natural causes...

22:48.144 --> 22:51.525
in what was called an American
relocation camp in New Mexico...

22:51.608 --> 22:53.986
during World War II.

22:54.737 --> 22:58.869
Both boys apparently disappeared
during the chaos at the end of the war.

23:00.914 --> 23:04.294
You see, it was so easy
to lose track of people then.

23:06.589 --> 23:09.344
I'm sorry that the records
cannot tell us more.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.557
You've been a great help. Thank you.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.854
This is the reason Steve left.

23:22.406 --> 23:24.952
No one saw
Wonder Woman deliver it, did they?

23:25.035 --> 23:26.454
No, not even Steve.

23:28.332 --> 23:29.751
Why Los Alamos?

23:30.585 --> 23:32.964
The parents died ofnatural causes...

23:33.047 --> 23:36.762
in what was called an American
relocation camp in New Mexico...

23:36.845 --> 23:38.473
during World War II.

23:38.557 --> 23:40.351
Both boys apparently disappeared...

23:49.824 --> 23:50.867
Diana?

23:50.951 --> 23:54.456
I can't explain now,
but Steve might be running into a trap.

24:18.869 --> 24:20.580
Regional, this is Trevor.

24:20.706 --> 24:23.711
I'm on Route 5,
approaching Mountain View Inn.

24:25.129 --> 24:27.299
Roger, Steve, we read you loud and clear.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.504
Trevor to Regional!

25:45.589 --> 25:48.426
You won't believe this,
but my jeep's out of control.

25:48.509 --> 25:50.805
I'm heading across the desert, due south.

25:50.889 --> 25:52.307
I can't steer it...

25:53.434 --> 25:56.272
I can't brake it,
I can't even turn the engine off.

25:56.355 --> 25:59.986
Don't ask me to explain, but that's
what's happening. Please acknowledge.

26:00.778 --> 26:02.323
Regional, come in.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.953
Trevor to Regional.
My jeep finally stopped.

26:59.329 --> 27:03.126
I'm out in the middle of the desert,
about 40 miles south of Route 5.

27:03.793 --> 27:07.090
It appears to be a deserted camp
of some kind. Acknowledge.

27:11.681 --> 27:13.142
Nice talking with you.

29:57.649 --> 30:00.195
Ishida! Come on out!

30:00.779 --> 30:03.157
I don't know how you got me here,
but I'm here.

30:03.242 --> 30:04.618
Let's stop playing games.

30:05.245 --> 30:07.540
It is not a game with me, Mr. Trevor.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.803
When I was last here,
there were plenty of rules.

30:16.262 --> 30:18.724
I suppose it was you controlling my jeep.

30:18.807 --> 30:22.522
There is nothing wrong with your jeep.
You could operate it now...

30:22.897 --> 30:24.358
if I choose to let you.

30:24.775 --> 30:26.778
But you don't choose to let me?

30:27.070 --> 30:28.239
I cannot.

30:29.115 --> 30:31.744
If you go, Wonder Woman
will not look for you.

30:31.911 --> 30:33.622
That is why I brought you here.

30:33.706 --> 30:37.128
You did type that note, didn't you?
How did you get into my office?

30:37.211 --> 30:40.383
Ask Dr. Wilson. I'm sure he could explain.

30:41.175 --> 30:42.595
Then, he's here, too?

30:42.803 --> 30:44.306
I had no choice.

30:44.389 --> 30:47.686
I hate to tell you,
but I have no choice either.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.899
Now, take me to Dr. Wilson.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.113
I said, take me to Dr...

31:09.596 --> 31:13.184
I could've hurt you very badly.
Don't make me.

31:14.019 --> 31:16.272
I don't want you on my conscience.

31:26.789 --> 31:28.709
Los Alamos, this is Wonder Woman.

31:28.792 --> 31:32.047
Can you tell me if flight 69578 has arrived?

31:32.131 --> 31:33.257
Wonder Woman?

31:33.340 --> 31:35.553
We don't accept CB monikers
down here, lady.

31:35.636 --> 31:38.098
What are the call letters
on your flight, over?

31:38.182 --> 31:39.726
I don't have any.

31:39.809 --> 31:41.520
Then you'd better get out of the air.

31:41.604 --> 31:44.859
You're flying over restricted
government land, and you could...

31:46.862 --> 31:48.406
I'm sorry, Wonder Woman.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.993
I've been instructed
to give you any help you Want.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.875
Flight 69578 landed at 1400 hours.

31:55.417 --> 31:58.422
He requisitioned a jeep
and headed West on Route 6.

31:58.505 --> 32:01.134
His destination: Mountain View Inn. Over.

32:01.384 --> 32:03.638
I'll have Steve contact you
when I've found him.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.224
Roger, Wonder Woman. Out.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.377
Why did you choose Ishida?

32:23.920 --> 32:27.175
Because he's the
only true psychokinetic I've ever found.

32:27.425 --> 32:29.763
I don't even know
which is the stronger now:

32:29.846 --> 32:32.141
my machine or Ishida's mind.

33:29.272 --> 33:30.273
Fire!

33:41.500 --> 33:44.421
Welcome to my old home,
Wonder Woman.

33:48.219 --> 33:52.100
It has been a long time
since you last visited this place.

33:52.350 --> 33:53.811
Over 30 years.

33:54.394 --> 33:56.272
I was a child then.

33:56.356 --> 33:58.902
Now that you're a man,
why do you come back here?

33:58.985 --> 34:01.364
And why do you
so obviously want me here?

34:01.447 --> 34:03.242
To settle an old score.

34:03.325 --> 34:05.496
Revenge survives the ages.

34:07.457 --> 34:09.502
Where are Steve Trevor and Dr. Wilson?

34:09.585 --> 34:10.629
Here.

34:10.712 --> 34:12.089
Let them go.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.926
That depends on you.

34:15.929 --> 34:19.518
Whatever you want, I'll do,
as long as it doesn't break any laws.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.896
There is no law out here, Wonder Woman!

34:22.271 --> 34:24.190
There never was real law.

34:24.274 --> 34:26.570
Only military oppression of my people.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.373
This belonged to my father...

34:34.875 --> 34:37.838
and his, and his before that...

34:37.920 --> 34:39.757
for 400 years.

34:40.634 --> 34:43.764
I had to win it back
in a common poker game...

34:43.847 --> 34:46.936
from a Gl who used it to chop steaks.

34:47.353 --> 34:50.692
I don't deny that cruel and unjust things
were done to your people.

34:50.775 --> 34:52.319
War is cruel and unjust.

34:52.695 --> 34:56.701
But in all the time since, real efforts
have been made to right those wrongs...

34:56.867 --> 35:00.373
to give all people all over the world
the dignity that you fought for.

35:00.456 --> 35:01.708
Dignity?

35:02.418 --> 35:05.297
The last is all I have from this place...

35:06.633 --> 35:08.177
just dignity!

35:08.302 --> 35:11.516
I don't understand you.
I didn't put you in this camp.

35:11.599 --> 35:14.144
And I did nothing
to hurt you or your family, either.

35:14.228 --> 35:16.106
What about my brother?

35:16.189 --> 35:19.695
The only family I had left,
until you destroyed it.

35:20.863 --> 35:24.786
I couldn't have killed your brother.
My mission is to save, not take lives.

35:24.869 --> 35:26.539
It's the code that I live by.

35:27.332 --> 35:31.588
You say that now,
but it wasn't so 35 years ago.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.677
You were one of
the army's bloodhounds then.

35:35.302 --> 35:37.515
When my brother and I tried to escape...

35:38.641 --> 35:41.604
you called down artillery fire on our heads.

35:41.938 --> 35:44.526
Was that for the practice of your soldiers?

35:45.443 --> 35:47.530
Then you are one of the brothers.

35:47.780 --> 35:50.034
So, you now remember.

36:01.719 --> 36:03.889
They know we escaped.
They're trying to get us.

36:03.973 --> 36:05.141
Let's keep going!

36:05.392 --> 36:08.021
- No, it's too dangerous.
- I won't go back.

36:10.608 --> 36:11.901
Boys!

36:17.201 --> 36:21.000
Boys, you're in the middle of a target area.
Let me take you back.

36:21.333 --> 36:22.418
Who are you?

36:22.501 --> 36:25.256
It doesn't matter who she is.
She's part of the same trap.

36:25.339 --> 36:26.466
Come back!

36:37.483 --> 36:40.905
- You killed my brother!
- No, please, come with me.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.409
You killed my brother!

36:47.374 --> 36:49.335
You killed my brother!

36:49.627 --> 36:52.382
No, I was trying to save Masaaki.

36:52.466 --> 36:54.886
I did save him, and I wanted to save you.

36:54.969 --> 36:56.722
I still don't believe you.

37:22.554 --> 37:26.935
It took 20 years to couple my machine
to Ishida's mind, for this.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.523
He hasn't beaten her yet.

37:30.734 --> 37:33.112
Ishida, this is senseless.
Your brother is alive.

37:33.196 --> 37:37.035
I carried him back to the camp hospital.
When I returned, I couldn't find you.

37:37.118 --> 37:38.746
I met Mexican workers.

37:39.163 --> 37:40.999
They helped me to get to Mexico.

37:41.417 --> 37:44.672
They even helped me to return to Japan
when the war ended.

37:44.881 --> 37:46.592
I am so glad you survived.

37:46.925 --> 37:50.389
Yes, to finish what was started
35 years ago.

37:52.142 --> 37:53.686
I won't fight you.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.522
Then defend yourself.

38:07.208 --> 38:08.877
You can't defeat me, Ishida.

38:09.711 --> 38:12.841
Please, try to put it out of your mind
and understand the truth.

38:15.678 --> 38:18.975
If we could only get to the machine,
we could stop him.

38:21.688 --> 38:23.024
We could?

38:41.552 --> 38:42.971
- Ishida-
- Stop!

38:44.557 --> 38:48.730
You will move now, only when I command.

38:57.662 --> 38:59.205
The circuits are overloading!

38:59.288 --> 39:02.460
If I can reach it,
I'll overload it once and for all!

39:06.216 --> 39:09.054
Turn around and watch.

39:24.328 --> 39:27.708
Yes, Wonder Woman, a minefield!

39:28.250 --> 39:31.589
I am going to kill you
the way you killed my brother.

39:32.006 --> 39:33.217
Walk!

40:15.032 --> 40:17.661
Looks like your machine
is overloading, Dr. Wilson.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.976
I command you, walk!

40:40.364 --> 40:42.909
You're one step from annihilation,
Wonder Woman.

40:45.371 --> 40:46.456
Take it!

40:53.717 --> 40:55.137
Take that step!

41:02.481 --> 41:03.692
Take it!

41:35.449 --> 41:38.121
Your special powers are gone now, Ishida.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.794
Only because yours
was greater than mine, Wonder Woman.

41:45.632 --> 41:47.552
We all have powers, Ishida.

41:47.635 --> 41:50.307
What makes them special
is the way we use them.

41:50.807 --> 41:53.311
It is true that mine proved
greater than yours...

41:53.520 --> 41:56.274
but mine are used for good, while yours...

41:59.779 --> 42:01.615
Well, I have no special powers now.

42:07.332 --> 42:08.751
Why do you hesitate?

42:09.670 --> 42:12.424
It is to give you a moment
to prepare for death.

42:12.758 --> 42:14.970
I don't believe your samurai code
allows you...

42:15.053 --> 42:16.848
to strike down a defenseless opponent.

42:16.931 --> 42:19.728
I have waited a lifetime for this moment.

42:19.811 --> 42:23.024
Because a 6-year-old boy believes
he saw what never happened.

42:24.861 --> 42:27.323
I do not yet know the truth.

42:31.037 --> 42:32.289
You are right.

42:34.292 --> 42:35.961
I cannot strike.

42:41.344 --> 42:42.555
Wonder Woman!

42:42.930 --> 42:44.475
They are locked in the cell!

43:23.827 --> 43:25.956
Steve, are you all right?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.959
Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.

43:32.466 --> 43:34.177
Dr. Wilson, are you all right?

43:59.175 --> 44:00.636
Hello, Ishida.

44:01.011 --> 44:02.054
Forgive me.

44:02.137 --> 44:05.643
If I had known you were coming,
I would have been correctly dressed.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.522
- You look fine.
- Just great. What are you doing?

44:09.441 --> 44:12.738
The roots of my bonsai
have lost its vitality.

44:13.113 --> 44:15.992
If I replant, it will grow to new beauty.

44:16.159 --> 44:18.538
Well, it sounds like
a good philosophy for living.

44:18.622 --> 44:19.832
Yes.

44:21.627 --> 44:24.756
Would you take one of these,
as a gift for Wonder Woman?

44:25.257 --> 44:26.718
I caused her grief.

44:27.135 --> 44:29.222
- This might bring happiness.
- Thank you.

44:30.807 --> 44:34.230
Now I'm ready to accept my punishment.

44:34.605 --> 44:37.109
Ishida, we're not here
to take you into custody.

44:37.401 --> 44:38.904
But I don't understand.

44:39.238 --> 44:40.489
There are no charges.

44:40.573 --> 44:43.410
The government isn't pressing
because of the circumstances.

44:43.494 --> 44:45.831
What of Dr. Wilson? What of him?

44:46.040 --> 44:48.960
He's dropped his charges also.
His machine has been fixed.

44:50.296 --> 44:51.632
I am free?

44:52.299 --> 44:53.385
In a sense.

44:53.468 --> 44:57.390
You still have the responsibility of one
of the most powerful minds in the world.

44:57.474 --> 45:00.938
We came in the hope that we could
persuade you to put it to work again.

45:01.021 --> 45:02.232
Of course.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.487
How can I thank you?

45:06.822 --> 45:08.241
By coming with us.

45:11.454 --> 45:12.706
Just as you are.

45:13.499 --> 45:15.962
Please, I will get my coat.

45:32.695 --> 45:34.991
Try harder, Ishida. Concentrate.

45:40.834 --> 45:42.837
Come on, Ishida, try and open the door.

45:45.091 --> 45:47.094
I am afraid I have disappointed you.

45:47.594 --> 45:49.222
I cannot open the door.

45:49.555 --> 45:51.183
Well, in that case, may I?

46:00.114 --> 46:02.451
Ishida, say hello to your brother.

46:03.202 --> 46:05.455
- Masaaki!
- Takeo!

46:10.255 --> 46:12.133
I'm glad we rigged the machine.

46:16.138 --> 46:19.143
But the mind machine really
has been repaired, hasn't it?

46:19.227 --> 46:21.438
I Would hate to think Dr. Wilson's Work...

46:21.522 --> 46:24.026
Would end up being
much ado about nothing.

46:24.110 --> 46:27.323
It works all right, sir.
We simply didn't plug it in.

46:27.740 --> 46:30.620
Their meeting after all these years
was a beautiful moment.

46:30.704 --> 46:34.835
There Were some tragic errors after
the hysteria that followed Pearl Harbor.

46:35.085 --> 46:37.214
I guess that's why pencils have erasers.

46:37.297 --> 46:40.677
It's a shame,
but we learn from our mistakes.

46:41.429 --> 46:44.350
We've learned that East
is no longer simply "East. "

46:44.434 --> 46:47.730
Agreed. Our relationship With Japan
has never been better.

46:48.022 --> 46:50.359
And Wonder Woman
should certainly get an assist.

46:50.442 --> 46:52.070
Why, thank you, Joe.

46:52.153 --> 46:53.239
Sir?

46:53.322 --> 46:54.574
For reminding me.

46:54.658 --> 46:57.495
I'm to throw out the first ball
of the new season.

46:57.996 --> 47:00.917
Nice job all around. Congratulations.

47:01.001 --> 47:02.920
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

47:03.004 --> 47:04.381
Joe, I just had a thought.

47:04.464 --> 47:07.636
Some ball club ought to put
Wonder Woman on their pitching staff.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.472
That's something worth thinking about.

47:09.556 --> 47:12.269
She could be the first female
to crack the major leagues.

47:12.352 --> 47:15.106
Why not? Sometimes she seems
to be in two places at once.

47:15.189 --> 47:17.485
She could pitch
and play catcher at the same time.

47:17.569 --> 47:19.405
- And first base?
- And second.

47:19.864 --> 47:21.324
How about shortstop?

48:04.976 --> 48:06.145
