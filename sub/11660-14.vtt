(serene music playing)

00:58.633 --> 01:00.834
He should have been here
a half hour ago.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.133
You should never wait
more than 20 minutes for a date.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.333
She's already waited six months.
What's another half hour?

01:10.467 --> 01:12.333
I hate blind dates!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.700
Ma, I never would've agreed to this

01:14.767 --> 01:18.066
if he wasn't Edna's good-looking
doctor nephew.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.967
Oh, he wasn't available anymore.

01:21.033 --> 01:23.367
He decided to buy a woman
from the Philippines.

01:25.133 --> 01:26.934
Actually, he bought two women.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.033
He wanted an extra
for formal occasions.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.567
Then who's this guy?

01:31.633 --> 01:34.000
I will tell you the truth.
I was on the bus--

01:34.066 --> 01:38.166
You set Dorothy up with some guy
you met on a bus?

01:38.233 --> 01:40.900
Please, it wasn't that glamorous.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.300
I saw a sign on the bus.

01:43.367 --> 01:44.700
It said, "Lonely?

01:44.767 --> 01:46.900
Can't make connections
with that special person?"

01:46.967 --> 01:50.700
I sent in a picture,
they ran it through the computer.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.633
Boom, you got a social life.

01:53.700 --> 01:58.834
Ma, you sent my picture
to a total stranger?

01:58.900 --> 02:01.834
I sent the picture
that came with my wallet.

02:06.867 --> 02:08.867
Ma, I'm furious with you.

02:08.934 --> 02:12.533
Your date will be mad when he
finds out you're not Janet Gaynor.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.233
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, God.

02:17.300 --> 02:20.900
Now, Dorothy, just remember
how important first impressions are.

02:20.967 --> 02:22.300
Honey, stand up straight.

02:22.367 --> 02:24.033
Put your left hand on your hip.

02:24.100 --> 02:27.133
Strike a very sexy,
sultry pose.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.367
Hello.

02:32.433 --> 02:33.834
Hi, Dorothy.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.300
What's wrong with your hip?

02:40.100 --> 02:42.533
I was hoping you'd be my date, Rose.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.066
Oh, gee, I'm busy tonight.
Try me again next week.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.533
What's in the box?

02:48.600 --> 02:51.900
Brochures for the Be-A-Pal program.
I'm mailing them out.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.233
How does that work?

02:53.300 --> 02:56.700
You just put them in an envelope.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.500
Not that, you idiot.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.900
Oh, the Be-A-Pal program.

03:00.967 --> 03:04.333
Well, each week you get a
motherless girl and be her pal.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.834
Help her with homework,
take her to movies, have dinner together.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.300
Now, that's very interesting.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.233
Maybe I could get involved
with that.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.767
You, Blanche?

03:13.834 --> 03:17.033
Sure.
Nothing would be more satisfying

03:17.100 --> 03:21.600
than to be of loving service
to a lonely, motherless child.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.867
I'll have to see pictures
of the father before I commit.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.533
I'll call the office
about sending over two girls.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.166
Great. Count me in.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.000
(doorbell rings)

03:41.033 --> 03:42.567
Hi. I'm Eddie.

03:45.533 --> 03:48.834
It took a computer
to come up with this?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.300
I'm Dorothy.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.367
These are my friends,
Blanche and Rose.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.166
-Hello.
-How do you do?

03:58.233 --> 04:01.066
Eddie, I hope you're not
too terribly disappointed.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.900
My mother wasn't exactly honest
in sending in that picture.

04:04.967 --> 04:06.133
I knew that.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.367
I have quite a few Janet Gaynor's
in frames around my house.

04:10.433 --> 04:12.767
Believe me, when you've
been in a deep depression

04:12.834 --> 04:15.467
for a year and a half,
nothing phases you.

04:16.900 --> 04:20.233
Well... Eddie,

04:20.300 --> 04:22.867
what wonderful things have
you got planned for tonight?

04:22.934 --> 04:26.200
Nothing. I was gonna cancel,
but my therapist wouldn't let me.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.266
Perhaps if we spoke to him together.

04:30.934 --> 04:33.900
I'm sorry,
I'm still not really recovered.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.066
You see, after 25 years of marriage,

04:36.133 --> 04:38.700
my wife Roberta sent me
a "dear, John" letter.

04:38.767 --> 04:41.133
That's terrible. Married 25 years

04:41.200 --> 04:43.367
and she doesn't know
your name is Eddie?

04:50.200 --> 04:53.100
Well, I guess I have to feed you.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.100
Let's go look for a place to eat,
Roberta.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.200
No, no. Her name's Dorothy.
Your ex-wife is Roberta.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.266
Sure, rub my nose in it.

05:05.433 --> 05:10.100
(serene music playing)

05:11.834 --> 05:13.800
Good morning, Blanche.
You're up early.

05:13.867 --> 05:17.300
I'm listing things
to do with our pals.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.734
I just hope I'm good.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.233
With all that enthusiasm,
you will be.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.934
I want to make a difference
in the lives of these youngsters.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.100
I want to mold them.

05:28.166 --> 05:33.500
I want to become a positive
influence on their young lives.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.166
It is only one
afternoon a week?

05:39.500 --> 05:42.533
Dorothy Zbornak,
are you just getting in?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.433
No, I got up early

05:44.500 --> 05:48.033
and went jogging in a park
with a strict dress code.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.333
I need some coffee.

05:56.166 --> 05:57.834
What's the number
of the police station?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.166
Is anything wrong, Sophia?

05:59.233 --> 06:02.266
I want to find out where to buy
the best doughnuts.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.200
Of course,
something is wrong!

06:07.233 --> 06:09.133
Dorothy never came home!

06:09.200 --> 06:11.367
Yes, she did.
She's in the kitchen.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.033
All right, spill it. I want details.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, so do I.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.033
There's not much to tell.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.100
Eddie took me to the restaurant
where he'd met his ex-wife Roberta.

06:24.166 --> 06:27.100
Going there would
remind him of her.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.400
It did,
especially since she owns it,

06:29.467 --> 06:32.333
runs it, and calls
the place Roberta's.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.433
He begged her to come back to him.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.033
After he had wept
over his crab cakes,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.066
I begged her to come back to him.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.400
You won't see him again.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.967
Oh, yes, I will.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.734
-What?
-Listen, pussycat.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.800
It's been a long time
since you've dated.

06:51.867 --> 06:57.200
Maybe you can't judge
a good one from a bad one.

06:57.266 --> 06:58.633
So let me be of help.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.633
Bad date, Dorothy.
Bad, bad date!

07:08.033 --> 07:10.166
What did you do
the rest of the night?

07:10.233 --> 07:11.934
I tried to comfort him.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.233
I must've lost track of time,
because the next thing I knew,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.266
it was morning.
I better get some rest.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.867
We're meeting for lunch.

07:20.633 --> 07:23.533
I don't get it. They don't seem
to have anything in common.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.467
I guess it's just like
that old saying, you know,

07:25.533 --> 07:28.433
-opposites attract.
-That's very true.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.233
Back in St. Olaf,
Ollie Canoodinspringle

07:31.300 --> 07:34.967
and his wife Bridget
were opposites in every way.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I mean, he was fat, she was thin.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.467
He was neat, she was sloppy.

07:40.533 --> 07:43.400
He was tall,
she was short.

07:43.467 --> 07:46.000
He was cheap,
she was extravagant.

07:47.667 --> 07:51.000
-He was--
-Opposites. We get the picture.

07:53.233 --> 07:55.467
Well, anyway,
I'll never forget the time

07:55.533 --> 07:57.500
they sang at our annual
talent show.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.734
Right after
the herring juggling act.

07:59.800 --> 08:04.233
You mean to tell me
that somebody juggled herring?

08:04.300 --> 08:08.166
No. It was the Herring
who did the juggling.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.433
Tiny little Ginsu knives.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.266
Really, very dangerous.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.433
I mean, one false move,
they could've filleted themselves.

08:22.033 --> 08:23.333
I hate you.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.033
Anyway...

08:28.700 --> 08:30.667
(calm music playing)

08:30.734 --> 08:33.567
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, good. Here they are.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.200
Come in, girls.

08:38.266 --> 08:41.200
Hi. I'm Marla, and this is Jackie.

08:41.266 --> 08:43.333
Yes, and I'm Blanche.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.667
I knew from your voice
you'd be pretty.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.533
Oh, well, thank you.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.200
Rose, this is my little pal Jackie.

08:56.066 --> 08:59.600
-And your little pal Marla.
-Hi, Marla. Sit down.

08:59.667 --> 09:03.233
Is there anything special
you girls feel like doing?

09:03.300 --> 09:05.066
Would a movie be too much?

09:05.133 --> 09:09.734
Oh, no. We can see
<i>Oliver and Company</i> or <i>Roger Rabbit.</i>

09:09.800 --> 09:11.500
Or <i>Tequila Sunrise.</i>

09:11.567 --> 09:14.867
Mel Gibson
takes his shirt off a lot.

09:14.934 --> 09:17.633
I think you
and I will get along just fine.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.100
Let me freshen my makeup.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.633
Girls, come with me,

09:23.700 --> 09:25.633
and I'll show you
how I transform myself

09:25.700 --> 09:30.266
into a fresh-faced,
innocent young thing.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.433
Could you skip
the innocent part?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.567
The show starts in two hours.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.834
Hi, Rose. Blanche around?

09:44.900 --> 09:48.133
She's just showing the girls
some makeup tricks.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.800
-Anything I can do?
-No, thanks.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.066
I need to talk to somebody.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.467
Oh, I get it.

09:56.867 --> 10:00.767
You have a problem, and
you don't think I'm sophisticated

10:00.834 --> 10:02.200
or worldly enough to help.

10:02.266 --> 10:05.433
Oh, Rose. I'm sorry.
You got a minute?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.800
Sure, Dorothy.

10:09.266 --> 10:10.567
It's about Eddie.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.967
I've been seeing him
for a week now.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.233
I'm having a relationship with him

10:15.300 --> 10:19.400
like I've never had with a man
before in my life.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.900
It is purely physical.

10:21.967 --> 10:25.633
Eddie is the greatest lover
I've ever had.

10:27.533 --> 10:31.667
Dorothy, if we're going to do this,
you have to tell me the truth.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.133
I am telling you the truth.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.633
There's more to Eddie
than meets the eye,

10:41.700 --> 10:45.200
but all we have in common
is under the sheets.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.166
What's under the sheets?

10:54.967 --> 10:56.633
His cappuccino maker.

11:00.133 --> 11:04.700
Sex, Rose.
I am talking sex.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.200
We don't go to dinner
or the movies.

11:07.266 --> 11:10.800
We just go to bed,
and it is terrific.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.567
All that and cappuccino too?

11:18.800 --> 11:20.600
Well, what's the problem?

11:21.567 --> 11:24.667
-Did I say there's a problem?
-You wanted to talk.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.967
Can't one have a discussion
without having a problem?

11:28.033 --> 11:30.233
I thought maybe you were
feeling guilty.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.700
Why should I feel guilty?

11:32.767 --> 11:35.500
I'm having the time of my life.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.433
I just wanted to say it.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.633
But listen, honey.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.233
Don't mention this to anybody.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.400
It's something most people
wouldn't understand.

11:44.467 --> 11:48.467
Don't worry, Dorothy.
Rose Nylund can keep a secret.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.900
Do you know what Nylund
means in Norwegian?

11:51.967 --> 11:53.000
No.

11:53.066 --> 11:54.934
Well, I'm not telling you.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.133
(serene music playing)

12:04.000 --> 12:05.467
How do I look?

12:05.533 --> 12:06.834
Great, Dorothy.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.934
You going out with Eddie?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.300
Yes. By the way, Blanche,
I borrowed your gold earrings, ok?

12:12.367 --> 12:17.200
Fine, but I should caution you,
they were meant for petite ears.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.934
They'll just have to do until
Disney unveils their dumbo line.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.800
I better eat something
before Eddie gets here.

12:30.867 --> 12:33.333
Why don't you just eat out?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.934
There never seems to be time.

12:41.066 --> 12:44.900
You know, there's something rotten
in the state of Denmark.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.734
It's their cheese.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.166
They refuse to use preservatives.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.667
I mean between Dorothy and Eddie.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.567
There's something peculiar
in that relationship.

12:58.633 --> 13:01.133
You're right,
and I'll find out what it is

13:01.200 --> 13:04.533
or my name isn't Sophia... Sophia...

13:04.600 --> 13:05.633
Sophia Petrillo.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.166
Oh, yeah.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.500
Maybe the doctor's right.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.467
Maybe I do need
all three pills a day.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.266
Dorothy will never tell her.

13:15.333 --> 13:19.166
-What?
-The secret... that I don't know.

13:21.233 --> 13:24.467
Rose...

13:24.533 --> 13:28.000
there's something you know
that you're not telling me.

13:28.066 --> 13:31.600
Ask me anything you want.
You'll never break me.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.467
-So you don't love Eddie?
-No, Ma.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.233
Then why see him?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.400
Eddie's a love machine?

13:43.100 --> 13:44.700
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

13:44.767 --> 13:46.900
I held out as long as I could.

13:50.934 --> 13:52.533
She said she'd tickle me.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.567
You're a regular
Nelson Mandela, Rose.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.300
So that's it, lust.

14:01.367 --> 14:05.133
Look, Ma, I'm a grown woman,
and I have needs.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.300
Needs?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.734
You need food. You need air.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.400
You need a better wrinkle cream.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.100
You don't need sport nookie.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.000
This is wrong for you.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.767
This is why I didn't
tell you about this.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.300
You are always criticizing me.

14:24.367 --> 14:27.500
You are always
telling me what to do.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.100
This time I'll do
what's right for me,

14:30.166 --> 14:33.200
and nothing you say
will make me feel guilty.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.367
Boy, I wish I'd married Bing Crosby
when I had the chance.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.467
Why? Because he was such
a strict disciplinarian?

14:44.533 --> 14:48.000
Because I'd be wealthy
with my own place,

14:48.066 --> 14:50.033
so I wouldn't have to
listen to that crap.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.567
I just haven't found a thing today.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.433
I don't look right
in American clothes.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.266
I have a more European body.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.433
Oh, in Europe,
do they all have big butts too?

15:20.133 --> 15:21.367
Hi, Blanche.
Hi, Rose.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.600
-Hi, girls.
-Where have you been?

15:23.667 --> 15:27.000
We were helping elderly people
on the escalator.

15:27.066 --> 15:28.467
We lost track of time.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.567
How sweet. Isn't that sweet?

15:30.633 --> 15:32.300
Can you hold our bags?

15:32.367 --> 15:34.400
We want to toss pennies
in the fountain.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.533
I'll make a wish
that we stay pals forever.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.000
We'll see you in the car.

15:40.066 --> 15:41.767
Ok. Bye.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.166
Aren't they the greatest?

15:43.233 --> 15:46.667
Yes. Looks like I've
been a good influence.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.033
(beep beep)

15:49.100 --> 15:50.533
Excuse me, ladies.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.100
I need to inspect your bag.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.567
(mellow music playing)

15:59.700 --> 16:02.900
I thought you were both asleep.
Why are you just getting in?

16:02.967 --> 16:05.500
Because the justice
system in America

16:05.567 --> 16:10.400
is an imperfect and sluggish piece
of antiquated machinery.

16:11.867 --> 16:14.200
-What?
-We were in the slammer.

16:17.734 --> 16:20.834
Our cute little pals
stole some merchandise

16:20.900 --> 16:22.533
and made us the fall guys.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.533
We have to appear
in court tomorrow.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.500
Where were you
when we called?

16:28.567 --> 16:31.767
I was out with Eddie.
I just got home.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.567
Why didn't Sophia answer?

16:33.633 --> 16:37.567
She probably thought
it was me calling.

16:37.633 --> 16:42.066
It's a little guilt trick she's used
since I was 15.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.467
That and having major surgery

16:44.533 --> 16:46.834
and telling me about it
two days later.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.300
Sometimes she didn't even
need the surgery.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.300
That's guilt.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.333
The days of my mother making me
feel guilty are over.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.200
There is nothing wrong
with my relationship with Eddie,

17:04.266 --> 17:07.700
and if my mother can't buy it,
I'm very sorry, it is her problem.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.700
Oh, just getting in?

17:09.767 --> 17:12.533
If you're all just
using this place days,

17:12.600 --> 17:16.100
I'll get one of those
medical emergency beepers.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.100
I'd feel terrible
if you found me on the doorstep

17:19.166 --> 17:21.233
instead of <i>the Miami Herald.</i>

17:22.333 --> 17:24.000
Ma, it's not going to work.

17:24.066 --> 17:26.667
I don't feel guilty
about staying out all night,

17:26.734 --> 17:29.033
and I don't feel guilty about Eddie.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.500
Don't underestimate me.

17:30.567 --> 17:34.133
I could make you feel guilty
about bombing pearl harbor.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.266
Don't feel guilty.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.767
There's nothing wrong
with a physical relationship.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.300
You said so last night.

17:42.367 --> 17:46.333
If you'd let me finish,
Colonel Qaddafi,

17:46.400 --> 17:47.834
you might've understood.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.767
I thought this kind of relationship
was wrong for you.

17:50.834 --> 17:51.800
It's not.

17:51.867 --> 17:54.166
Dorothy, I'm your mother.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.934
You're a loving
and sensitive person,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.533
but this isn't going
to be enough someday.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.834
You'll be bored, dissatisfied,
and you'll end up unhappy.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.333
I hate to see that happen to you.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.467
But if you think you can handle
that, look me in the eye,

18:09.533 --> 18:11.467
and I'll drop the whole thing.

18:11.533 --> 18:12.867
Ma...

18:14.300 --> 18:16.233
I can handle that.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.433
Both eyes.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.266
I hate it when you're right,
and I knew you were right all along.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.834
What will you do?

18:26.900 --> 18:29.133
I'll have to talk with Eddie.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.000
It is obvious that this
relationship has to...

18:33.700 --> 18:35.000
taper off.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.633
All right, I'll end it!

18:44.800 --> 18:47.967
Girls, I know
you're going to tell the truth.

18:48.033 --> 18:51.266
We'd like to,
but we'll get in trouble.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.200
Most court judges know us.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.967
We've worn out our cute act.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.400
Listen, you little monsters,

18:58.467 --> 19:01.734
if you think we'll be your patsies,
think again.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.633
Maybe some cookies and milk
will change your mind.

19:09.300 --> 19:13.567
Here, how about $50,
and you tell the truth?

19:13.633 --> 19:16.333
-Are you trying to bribe us?
-You catch on quick.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.834
Make it 150. Each.

19:20.333 --> 19:23.467
Oh, you little pirates.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.000
All right, you've got it.
Now get out of here.

19:29.266 --> 19:31.100
-Thank you, Blanche.
-Oh, beat it.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.500
I can't believe you did that.

19:35.567 --> 19:39.467
Don't worry. We closed
that account last week.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.233
The bank would
sooner cash a check

19:45.300 --> 19:47.000
from Jim and Tammy Bakker.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.100
Where are the girls?

19:51.166 --> 19:53.767
They had a sudden
change of heart.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.767
They decided to confess.

19:55.834 --> 19:56.633
(doorbell rings)

19:56.700 --> 19:59.200
That's Eddie. I can't do this.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.500
We're right beside you
to help you through.

20:02.567 --> 20:06.433
Eddie has some kind of
a strange hold over me.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.667
Oh, baloney.

20:07.734 --> 20:11.000
Eddie is just a man
cut from the same cloth

20:11.066 --> 20:14.433
as the many men
who have dumped you over the years.

20:17.266 --> 20:20.734
Think of him as all those men,
Dorothy.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.633
Become the dumper
before you become the dumpee.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.800
You're right.
You're right.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.233
I'll dump him like Paul Bennington
dumped me,

20:29.300 --> 20:32.033
the way Steve Mendelbaum
got rid of me, the way Tom--

20:32.100 --> 20:36.300
We'll be here all afternoon.
Just open the door.

20:36.367 --> 20:39.667
Right. The man is history.

20:39.734 --> 20:42.200
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Eddie, I want you so bad.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.533
Dorothy.

20:44.600 --> 20:48.533
He looks so cute
in that little suit.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.934
Is something wrong, Dorothy?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Yes, there is something wrong.
Eddie, we have to...

20:53.667 --> 20:55.100
Stop doing that with your lip.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.500
Doing what?

20:56.567 --> 21:01.000
That sexy quivering thing
in the corner of your mouth.

21:01.066 --> 21:05.700
I was loosening up a poppy seed
caught in my teeth.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.467
-Well. It's driving me crazy.
-Dorothy!

21:09.533 --> 21:11.734
Come here, Eddie.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.100
Sit down here.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.266
Listen, what Dorothy
is trying to tell you...

21:18.600 --> 21:20.133
what's that cologne
you're wearing?

21:22.467 --> 21:23.967
I'm not wearing cologne.

21:24.033 --> 21:29.834
It smells like a mixture
of old spice and musk and...

21:29.900 --> 21:32.266
-And a porterhouse steak?
-Yes.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.367
The smell really gets intense
when I sweat.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.200
Really? I'd be curious
to find out just how--

21:41.266 --> 21:43.700
Blanche!

21:43.767 --> 21:45.233
Oh.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.900
Now, look here, Eddie.

21:46.967 --> 21:51.266
Dorothy's decided she wants
nothing more to do with you.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.900
I can't understand why

21:52.967 --> 21:56.233
because you have
the cutest ears I've ever seen

21:56.300 --> 21:58.934
in my entire life.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.433
They make you kind
of look like Bambi.

22:03.533 --> 22:04.667
Marry me, Eddie.

22:04.734 --> 22:06.700
Ladies, ladies.

22:06.767 --> 22:08.133
Please.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.200
This always happens.
I'm cursed.

22:11.266 --> 22:12.867
Ever since I was a little kid,

22:12.934 --> 22:16.867
I've been absolutely
irresistible to women.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.834
I'm a little plain to look at--

22:18.900 --> 22:20.367
You're not plain.

22:20.433 --> 22:22.467
-You're adorable.
-Cute.

22:22.533 --> 22:25.033
Please let me finish.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.834
I know I'm plain to look at,

22:27.900 --> 22:32.266
but everything I do seems to drive
the opposite sex crazy.

22:32.333 --> 22:35.433
I don't do it on purpose.
It just happens.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.734
The way I look at a woman,

22:37.800 --> 22:41.567
the way I make love to a woman,
the way I kiss a woman,

22:41.633 --> 22:44.000
the way I make love to a woman.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.133
You said make love twice.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.033
I know. It's my favorite.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.700
I'm not surprised
you wanted to dump me.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.166
The good ones always do.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.100
They end up wanting more

22:59.166 --> 23:01.767
than nights filled
with unbridled ecstasy.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.200
What are you doing tomorrow night?

23:07.066 --> 23:09.567
I'd better get going.
I've caused enough trouble.

23:09.633 --> 23:14.333
Can't we see each other occasionally
just as friends?

23:14.400 --> 23:15.333
It won't work.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.867
It's like trying
to eat one potato chip.

23:23.066 --> 23:24.800
<i>Au revoir.</i>

23:24.867 --> 23:26.200
Oh, hello, Sophia.

23:26.266 --> 23:27.867
Hello, Eddie.

23:27.934 --> 23:31.100
Oh, Eddie,
I never noticed that beauty mark.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.367
-What beauty mark?
-That one!

23:34.734 --> 23:37.066
Sophia! Sophia!

23:43.467 --> 23:46.700
(theme music playing)
