WEBVTT

00:02.031 --> 00:03.165
DOLE:
Previously on The Practice...

00:03.198 --> 00:03.965
FRUTT: Mitchell, come on.

00:03.998 --> 00:05.534
I'm going
to the favor bank here.

00:05.567 --> 00:07.102
I will give you anything.

00:07.136 --> 00:10.004
MITCH: Anything?
Take off your shirt.

00:11.973 --> 00:13.508
So if I have sex with you,

00:13.542 --> 00:14.776
you'll cut a deal?

00:14.809 --> 00:17.612
I am extremely sorry
for my inappropriate behavior.

00:17.646 --> 00:20.749
Obviously any deal predicated
on a sexual relationship

00:20.782 --> 00:23.485
is wrong and hereby
off the table.

00:23.518 --> 00:24.719
FRUTT: You know, Mitchell,
I am getting this

00:24.753 --> 00:26.521
sickening feeling
that your offer

00:26.555 --> 00:28.022
wasn't pulled
because of conscience,

00:28.057 --> 00:29.991
but because
I wouldn't go for it.

00:30.024 --> 00:31.693
KITTLESON:
Was sex put on the table

00:31.726 --> 00:33.228
as part of a plea bargain?

00:33.262 --> 00:35.430
Yes, by Ms. Frutt.

00:35.464 --> 00:37.066
FRUTT: You think
that I would resort

00:37.099 --> 00:39.534
to making up
this kind of story?

00:39.568 --> 00:41.170
KITTLESON: Ellenor,
I'm inclined to believe you,

00:41.203 --> 00:43.038
but trust me
when I advise you,

00:43.072 --> 00:44.439
let this drop.

00:44.473 --> 00:46.375
Don't do any more
cases with him.

00:47.476 --> 00:50.745
MITCHELL: We want you to offer
Judge Fleming a bribe.

00:50.779 --> 00:52.214
Which brings you to me,
is that right?

00:52.247 --> 00:53.382
You'd like
to make a deal, too.

00:53.415 --> 00:55.417
If possible,
Your Honor, yes.

00:56.885 --> 00:58.320
$10,000.

00:58.353 --> 00:59.854
Judge Charles Fleming?
What's going on?

00:59.888 --> 01:01.756
AGENT: You're under arrest
for accepting bribes.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.891
FLEMING: I have done
nothing illicit.

01:02.924 --> 01:06.361
What I did do was expedite cases
that came before me.

01:06.395 --> 01:09.198
If I benefited from such,
well, then, so be it.

01:09.231 --> 01:10.699
You have cast out
the dirty judge.

01:10.732 --> 01:11.566
Justice is restored.

01:13.935 --> 01:14.603
(gunshot)

01:18.907 --> 01:21.476
MAN: Hey, guys, here they are.
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.

01:21.510 --> 01:22.844
Mr. Young...

01:22.877 --> 01:26.815
(overlapping chatter)

01:32.154 --> 01:33.622
YOUNG: That's correct,
Your Honor.

01:33.655 --> 01:35.724
We are seeking
an immediate modification

01:35.757 --> 01:38.793
of the court's previously issued
conditions of release.

01:38.827 --> 01:40.329
Yes. Just a moment.

01:40.362 --> 01:43.565
$50,000 bail,
the stay-away order

01:43.598 --> 01:45.734
forbidding contact
with the wife or child,

01:45.767 --> 01:47.669
and the suspension
of any rights

01:47.702 --> 01:49.338
to make health
and welfare decisions

01:49.371 --> 01:50.472
regarding that child.

01:50.505 --> 01:52.841
Those rights shall reside
with the mother.

01:54.809 --> 01:56.311
This all seems equitable,

01:56.345 --> 01:57.912
given the seriousness
of the crime

01:57.946 --> 01:59.748
with which your client
has been charged.

01:59.781 --> 02:02.284
I'd ask you to consider
the nightmare

02:02.317 --> 02:03.752
in which my client
finds himself.

02:03.785 --> 02:06.155
GAMBLE: Your Honor, Mr. Goss
created that nightmare

02:06.188 --> 02:08.056
by putting his daughter
in a coma.

02:08.090 --> 02:09.691
Mr. Goss is innocent.

02:09.723 --> 02:12.427
He has been baby "M"'s
primary caregiver

02:12.461 --> 02:13.695
while his wife worked,

02:13.728 --> 02:15.130
and now his child is sick.

02:15.164 --> 02:16.698
YOUNG: But under
this court order,

02:16.731 --> 02:19.000
he is neither permitted
to see his child,

02:19.034 --> 02:21.436
nor to make critical
medical decisions

02:21.470 --> 02:23.972
that could determine
whether she lives or dies.

02:24.005 --> 02:25.907
Then you do understand
my decision.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.676
YOUNG: The fact remains,

02:27.709 --> 02:30.179
my client's rights as a parent

02:30.212 --> 02:32.114
should not be denied
simply because

02:32.147 --> 02:33.548
he's been charged with a crime.

02:33.582 --> 02:35.550
We're going in circles here.

02:35.584 --> 02:38.387
This father is requesting
that every effort be made

02:38.420 --> 02:39.754
to save the life
of his child.

02:39.788 --> 02:41.356
GAMBLE: He knows
if his child dies,

02:41.390 --> 02:44.126
he will be facing this jury
on murder charges.

02:44.159 --> 02:46.728
This is about baby "M."
Where is your compassion?

02:46.761 --> 02:49.798
I have no compassion for a man
who beats an innocent child.

02:49.831 --> 02:51.233
FREEMAN: All right,
that's enough.

02:52.367 --> 02:55.204
Till Mr. Goss is cleared
of the charges made against him,

02:55.237 --> 02:57.339
I have no intention
of endangering anyone.

02:58.006 --> 02:59.974
FREEMAN: The court's conditions
for release,

03:00.008 --> 03:03.378
including those
involving your client,

03:03.412 --> 03:06.348
to keep him away from seeing
his wife and child stand.

03:06.381 --> 03:08.817
FREEMAN: And if Mr. Goss
refuses to abide

03:08.850 --> 03:11.786
by those conditions,
I'll throw him in jail.

03:12.487 --> 03:14.256
Now, if there's
nothing else.

03:14.956 --> 03:16.691
Your Honor, may I approach?

03:19.161 --> 03:22.431
(people whispering)

03:25.067 --> 03:27.136
For the record,
I respectfully point out

03:27.169 --> 03:28.570
that you and the late
Judge Fleming

03:28.603 --> 03:29.304
were close friends.

03:30.439 --> 03:33.042
I'd also make it clear
that my partner, Bobby Donnell,

03:33.075 --> 03:35.410
was recruited
by the U. S. Attorney's Office.

03:35.444 --> 03:37.512
And the fact that Judge Fleming
took his own life

03:37.546 --> 03:38.613
after his wrongdoings
were uncovered, so--

03:38.647 --> 03:40.582
What are you implying?

03:42.384 --> 03:46.121
The court's duty
is to set reasonable bail.

03:46.155 --> 03:49.058
And perhaps you have undue
prejudice towards my client

03:49.091 --> 03:51.660
since you may wrongly assume
that Mr. Donnell

03:51.693 --> 03:54.796
was somehow responsible
for Judge Fleming's death.

03:55.464 --> 03:57.699
I move that you recuse yourself.

03:59.801 --> 04:02.604
Mr. Young,
I lost a dear friend,

04:02.637 --> 04:03.705
and for that, I'm saddened.

04:04.573 --> 04:05.940
But hear me now,

04:05.974 --> 04:08.677
don't you ever walk
into my courtroom

04:08.710 --> 04:10.212
and insult my integrity.

04:10.245 --> 04:12.414
Otherwise, I'll find you
in contempt so fast,

04:12.447 --> 04:14.149
your teeth will spin.

04:16.651 --> 04:18.187
Your motion is denied.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.656
FREEMAN: We're adjourned
until tomorrow,

04:21.690 --> 04:23.192
when this trial will begin.

04:23.625 --> 04:24.626
(gavel bangs)

04:26.295 --> 04:30.232
(music playing)

04:32.000 --> 04:33.802
We're taking a big chance.

04:33.835 --> 04:34.969
Yeah, but now if we lose,

04:35.003 --> 04:37.106
we can raise
the judge's bias on appeal.

04:37.139 --> 04:39.074
BERLUTI: This case is as ugly
as it gets,

04:39.108 --> 04:40.809
and it just got
a lot uglier.

04:40.842 --> 04:42.544
WOMAN: Mr. Young,
are you expecting a lengthy...

04:43.278 --> 04:46.948
(music playing)

05:31.960 --> 05:33.828
GAMBLE: Ellenor, wait.

05:34.429 --> 05:36.531
The assault case
you're handling this morning,

05:36.565 --> 05:37.899
my office is short-handed,

05:37.932 --> 05:39.534
and I had to assign
another A. D. A.

05:39.568 --> 05:41.070
I don't care
who I'm up against.

05:41.103 --> 05:42.804
(sighs)

05:42.837 --> 05:44.406
It's Mitchell Wheeler.

05:45.074 --> 05:47.509
Helen,
do I have to remind you

05:47.542 --> 05:49.244
he offered my client
a reduced sentence

05:49.278 --> 05:50.879
in exchange for a look
at my breasts?

05:50.912 --> 05:52.514
GAMBLE: I know,
and Judge Kittleson said

05:52.547 --> 05:54.416
the two of you shouldn't be
trying cases together,

05:54.449 --> 05:55.517
but I don't have a choice.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.386
Well, obviously
I don't have a choice.

05:57.419 --> 05:58.720
GAMBLE:
Ellenor, I promise,

05:58.753 --> 06:00.255
If he so much
as makes one single

06:00.289 --> 06:02.091
inappropriate remark,
or looks at you

06:02.124 --> 06:04.759
in any way that resembles
sexual harassment,

06:04.793 --> 06:06.261
I will severely
reprimand him.

06:06.295 --> 06:07.496
Yeah, I'm sure
he'd like that

06:07.529 --> 06:09.331
if a spanking
was part of the bargain.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.634
(sighs)

06:17.172 --> 06:19.474
What matters
is what the jury thinks.

06:19.508 --> 06:20.909
And trust me,
they can't see

06:20.942 --> 06:22.811
the face I'm seeing now.

06:22.844 --> 06:23.812
How can the judge forbid me

06:23.845 --> 06:25.447
from being
with my own daughter?

06:25.480 --> 06:27.216
YOUNG: Tom, try and relax.

06:27.249 --> 06:28.383
We're doing all we can.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.052
Really, this is just
the beginning.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.853
Yesterday was worth a shot,

06:31.886 --> 06:33.655
but the court didn't budge.

06:33.688 --> 06:35.857
If your wife decides
to disconnect

06:35.890 --> 06:38.627
Mary Beth's life-support
before the verdict,

06:38.660 --> 06:39.928
you have to accept that--

06:39.961 --> 06:42.697
TOM: Kelly won't disconnect
life-support.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.936
I received the prosecution's
witness list.

06:51.206 --> 06:52.341
Your wife is on it,

06:52.374 --> 06:54.576
And she's testifying
against you.

06:55.477 --> 06:57.479
We have to cross-examine her.

06:58.947 --> 06:59.614
No.

07:00.449 --> 07:02.417
She's been through
hell already,

07:02.451 --> 07:04.486
and I don't want her going
through any more.

07:04.519 --> 07:05.287
Tom, try to understand what--

07:05.320 --> 07:07.222
I said no, dammit!

07:12.361 --> 07:14.263
You and I don't know
what your wife will say

07:14.296 --> 07:15.130
when she gets up there.

07:16.331 --> 07:19.068
And right now,
you're the one on trial.

07:20.035 --> 07:22.104
The only other person
who could've put your baby

07:22.137 --> 07:24.439
in the hospital is Kelly.

07:25.307 --> 07:27.576
It's either you or her.

07:28.410 --> 07:29.678
I need to go for a walk.

07:29.711 --> 07:31.713
Listen, Tom--
Get out of my way!

07:37.952 --> 07:40.089
Eugene,
I wasn't trying to, uh...

07:45.694 --> 07:46.961
Go for that walk.

07:49.298 --> 07:51.733
And I don't wanna see you
till you've calmed down.

08:04.913 --> 08:08.850
(indistinct chatter)

08:11.853 --> 08:13.555
MITCH: Morning, Ellenor.
Don't talk to me.

08:18.660 --> 08:22.097
And, Ms. Kim, what do you do
in the cosmetics department?

08:22.131 --> 08:23.465
What's your job?

08:23.498 --> 08:25.200
I offer samples of perfume.

08:25.234 --> 08:27.102
MITCH: How do you offer
those samples?

08:27.702 --> 08:29.304
With just a small spray.

08:29.338 --> 08:30.805
That's not how
she doused me.

08:30.839 --> 08:32.107
Ms. Macintosh.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.308
Well, perhaps
you can demonstrate.

08:38.613 --> 08:39.948
A small spray.

08:40.381 --> 08:41.549
Like this.

08:42.984 --> 08:45.354
MITCH: Ms. Kim, when you offered
the defendant a sample,

08:45.387 --> 08:47.989
what happened?
She became angry.

08:48.022 --> 08:50.059
She told me to back off,

08:50.092 --> 08:51.726
then she knocked the bottle
from my hand.

08:52.227 --> 08:55.230
It crashed to the floor,
and glass went everywhere.

08:55.264 --> 08:57.566
I needed four stitches
on my ankle.

08:57.599 --> 08:59.968
Would you indicate
just who threatened you?

09:01.370 --> 09:02.037
There.

09:03.172 --> 09:05.274
MITCH: Thank you, Ms. Kim.
Nothing further, Your Honor.

09:09.211 --> 09:11.313
FRUTT: Ms. Kim,
would you please step down?

09:11.980 --> 09:13.182
Your Honor,
with your permission,

09:13.215 --> 09:16.017
I'd also ask that my client
come forward as well.

09:16.051 --> 09:18.253
Perhaps by reenacting
what happened,

09:18.287 --> 09:20.589
the jury would get a better
sense of what went on that day.

09:20.622 --> 09:23.225
MITCH: Your Honor, the defendant
hasn't even testified yet.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.326
This is gonna confuse
the jury.

09:24.359 --> 09:25.627
FRUTT: I'm only asking
that the court

09:25.660 --> 09:27.862
extend the same courtesy
to my client

09:27.896 --> 09:29.631
insofar as a demonstration goes.

09:29.664 --> 09:31.100
Get at it, Ms. Frutt.

09:32.601 --> 09:34.369
Ms. Kim, if you will.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.507
Your testimony was that
my client approached,

09:38.540 --> 09:41.610
and for no apparent reason,
she became belligerent.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.848
(screaming)

09:46.881 --> 09:48.283
FULTON: Bailiff! Bailiff!

09:48.883 --> 09:50.018
(gavel banging)
Order in the court!

09:50.052 --> 09:53.322
Order in this court! Order!

09:53.355 --> 09:55.124
Order in the court!

09:55.890 --> 09:57.459
Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up!

09:57.492 --> 09:59.027
FULTON: Order!
Break it up!

09:59.494 --> 10:02.197
Order in the court!
Order in the court!

10:08.303 --> 10:10.539
OFFICER: My partner and me,
we got a call from dispatch

10:10.572 --> 10:12.241
of a baby in distress.

10:12.274 --> 10:14.008
When we arrived at
the defendant's apartment,

10:14.043 --> 10:15.677
we rang the bell
and we knocked on the door.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.580
Did the defendant respond?
Yes.

10:18.613 --> 10:20.782
He said he wasn't able to wake
his baby from her nap.

10:20.815 --> 10:22.584
In fact, he wasn't even sure
she was alive.

10:22.617 --> 10:25.754
GAMBLE: How would you describe
Mr. Goss' demeanor at the time?

10:25.787 --> 10:29.124
Well, he didn't seem upset like
you--like you normally expect.

10:29.158 --> 10:30.092
Objection.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.426
FREEMAN: Sustained.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.828
Just tell us how
the defendant appeared.

10:34.529 --> 10:36.665
He was quiet,
kind of detached.

10:36.698 --> 10:39.068
GAMBLE: All right,
what did you do next?

10:39.101 --> 10:40.902
OFFICER: Well, we were directed
to the bedroom,

10:40.935 --> 10:43.405
where we found the infant
lying faceup in her crib.

10:43.438 --> 10:46.508
She wasn't breathing,
and she appeared cyanotic.

10:46.541 --> 10:48.110
Uh, she was bluish,
meaning she had been

10:48.143 --> 10:49.478
without oxygen
for some time.

10:49.511 --> 10:50.945
Her heart was beating?

10:50.979 --> 10:53.148
My partner found a very weak
pulse while I was bagging.

10:53.715 --> 10:55.217
I was helping her
to breathe.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.152
GAMBLE: During all this time,
was there anyone else

10:57.186 --> 10:58.287
in the apartment?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.189
No, just Mr. Goss.

11:02.557 --> 11:05.827
Tom Goss called 911, correct?
Yes.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.929
So, then, obviously he cared
about his daughter?

11:07.962 --> 11:10.232
Objection, speculation.
Overruled.

11:10.265 --> 11:11.666
It didn't seem
that he cared.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.568
YOUNG: Are you telling me
that in all the time

11:13.602 --> 11:15.370
you've been an EMT,

11:15.404 --> 11:17.072
you've never witnessed
anyone react

11:17.106 --> 11:18.173
the way Mr. Goss reacted?

11:18.707 --> 11:19.908
If my baby had stopped
breathing, I don't--

11:19.941 --> 11:21.376
But this wasn't your baby.

11:23.178 --> 11:26.148
Isn't it possible,
believing his daughter was dead

11:26.181 --> 11:27.482
that my client was in shock?

11:27.516 --> 11:29.151
Okay, sure, but I was--

11:29.184 --> 11:30.552
Were there any signs
of bruising?

11:31.320 --> 11:32.321
I didn't notice any.

11:32.354 --> 11:34.123
Any signs of abuse
whatsoever?

11:34.156 --> 11:36.158
OFFICER: Look, this was
an emergency response.

11:36.191 --> 11:37.926
I was there to save a life.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.161
It would have been
impossible for me

11:39.194 --> 11:40.062
to notice everything.

11:40.095 --> 11:42.164
That's exactly my point.

11:43.565 --> 11:44.633
Nothing further.

11:47.136 --> 11:49.604
Prosecution calls
Dr. Daniel Taylor,

11:49.638 --> 11:52.374
a Pediatric Care Specialist
at Boston General.

11:53.442 --> 11:55.444
TAYLOR: I've been
at Boston General 22 years,

11:55.477 --> 11:58.347
Chief of Pediatrics for 12.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.482
Were you involved
in baby "M"'s care?

12:00.515 --> 12:01.750
TAYLOR: From the beginning.

12:01.783 --> 12:03.885
She was born
six weeks premature.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.920
GAMBLE: Did she suffer
any complications

12:05.954 --> 12:07.822
as a result of her
premature birth?

12:07.856 --> 12:10.725
Well, her cardiovascular,
respiratory,

12:10.759 --> 12:13.895
and even neurological systems
were all underdeveloped,

12:13.928 --> 12:15.664
but I expected her to mature

12:15.697 --> 12:16.898
into a healthy child.

12:16.931 --> 12:19.934
How many times did baby "M"
visit your office?

12:19.968 --> 12:22.904
Over eight months,
about sixteen times.

12:22.937 --> 12:24.506
GAMBLE: Who would bring her?

12:24.539 --> 12:25.940
Almost always Mr. Goss.

12:25.974 --> 12:28.143
In about the third month,

12:28.177 --> 12:29.744
I started seeing indications

12:29.778 --> 12:31.046
that something was wrong.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.148
And on one visit,

12:33.182 --> 12:36.551
I noticed that the baby's
left leg was bruised.

12:36.585 --> 12:38.720
GAMBLE: Did you ask
Mr. Goss about it?

12:38.753 --> 12:40.122
TAYLOR: He thought
perhaps she had rolled

12:40.155 --> 12:42.191
against the side of her crib.

12:42.224 --> 12:44.226
There had been no bruising
before that incident,

12:44.259 --> 12:46.428
so I didn't think
much about it.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.230
Was there a second incident?

12:48.263 --> 12:49.831
Sidebar, Your Honor?

12:49.864 --> 12:50.565
Quickly.

12:55.637 --> 12:57.106
We've been over this pretrial.

12:57.139 --> 12:58.840
She can't bring up
the prior bruises.

12:58.873 --> 13:01.176
There's no evidence
linking them to my client.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.311
It's prejudicial.

13:02.344 --> 13:03.612
This is the treating physician,

13:03.645 --> 13:05.314
an expert witness
who can testify

13:05.347 --> 13:06.948
what he based his opinion on.

13:06.981 --> 13:09.384
You've got no proof
and no connection to my client.

13:09.418 --> 13:12.454
He can explain his opinion.
It's prejudicial.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.555
GAMBLE: Oh, come on,
what is it, Eugene?

13:13.588 --> 13:15.057
You afraid the jury's
gonna see your client

13:15.090 --> 13:16.225
for the lowlife he is?

13:16.258 --> 13:17.259
FREEMAN: Enough.

13:17.992 --> 13:20.595
I'm going to give the jury
a limiting instruction

13:20.629 --> 13:22.464
and permit this line
of questioning,

13:22.497 --> 13:25.467
for a while, Ms. Gamble,
but you're on a short leash.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.635
That's crap, and you know it.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.140
You better check
your emotions, Counselor.

13:32.541 --> 13:35.277
Whatever your personal animus
might be towards me,

13:35.310 --> 13:38.012
you're not acting in the best
interest of your client.

13:38.047 --> 13:39.848
I suggest that you get a grip

13:39.881 --> 13:42.184
before you jeopardize him
even further.

13:44.653 --> 13:46.088
Let me help you.

13:47.622 --> 13:48.723
Take a recess.

14:04.706 --> 14:06.141
She'll be fine.

14:06.175 --> 14:07.776
In fact,
probably a little bit richer

14:07.809 --> 14:09.811
since the prosecution's witness
flipped out on her.

14:09.844 --> 14:12.013
Why were charges filed
in the first place?

14:12.047 --> 14:14.183
Because the woman
is off her nut,

14:14.216 --> 14:15.850
and Mitchell Wheeler
is a horse's ass.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.094
What do you want?

14:25.660 --> 14:26.761
Two minutes.

14:27.529 --> 14:28.530
Please.

14:38.773 --> 14:40.075
You've got one minute.

14:41.343 --> 14:43.545
When I offered to reduce
your client's sentence

14:43.578 --> 14:45.747
to see your breasts,

14:45.780 --> 14:47.649
I not only obstructed justice,

14:47.682 --> 14:48.417
I hurt you.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.185
We were friends.

14:52.187 --> 14:54.656
I don't think you realize
just how much you hurt me.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.858
MITCH: You accused me
in front of Judge Kittleson.

14:56.891 --> 14:57.859
I was blindsided.

14:57.892 --> 14:59.761
Uh, all I could think
to do was accuse you.

14:59.794 --> 15:01.696
This isn't sounding like
an apology, Mitchell.

15:01.730 --> 15:02.964
Try to understand,

15:02.997 --> 15:05.200
it was either embarrass you,
or get disbarred.

15:05.234 --> 15:06.935
You made the wrong choice.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.537
I know.

15:08.570 --> 15:09.771
And if I could do it
all over again,

15:09.804 --> 15:11.273
I'd own up to my behavior.

15:13.108 --> 15:14.376
Ellenor...

15:15.177 --> 15:17.112
I'm sorry I hurt you,

15:18.047 --> 15:20.549
and I hope that someday
you're able to forgive me.

15:22.317 --> 15:24.018
Um, if you want to speak
to Judge Kittleson,

15:24.053 --> 15:25.154
then I'll back you up.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.760
Do not make this
my responsibility.

15:33.562 --> 15:35.564
I don't even know
why I'm listening.

15:35.597 --> 15:39.268
You accused and humiliated me
in open court,

15:39.301 --> 15:40.835
and then crushed me

15:40.869 --> 15:43.638
by suggesting I needed
psychological help.

15:46.108 --> 15:48.577
You are a real bastard.

15:55.317 --> 15:56.751
(sighs)

16:15.370 --> 16:17.739
I don't want you
asking me if I'm okay.

16:19.441 --> 16:20.542
All right?

16:22.177 --> 16:24.679
GAMBLE: So, Doctor,
it was your phone call

16:24.713 --> 16:26.315
to Social Services
that resulted

16:26.348 --> 16:27.949
in the defendant's arrest?

16:27.982 --> 16:30.319
TAYLOR: Yes.
There was a second incident.

16:30.352 --> 16:34.389
This time, there was a more
pronounced set of bruises.

16:34.423 --> 16:36.091
GAMBLE: What did
the defendant say?

16:36.125 --> 16:38.427
He made no explanation

16:38.460 --> 16:39.661
and that concerned me.

16:40.229 --> 16:41.896
I made a notation in the file

16:41.930 --> 16:44.566
and said I wanted to see
baby "M" after one week

16:44.599 --> 16:46.068
instead of the usual two.

16:46.635 --> 16:48.770
Unfortunately,
that appointment

16:48.803 --> 16:50.072
was never kept.

16:50.105 --> 16:51.940
GAMBLE: Please tell
the jury why.

16:51.973 --> 16:53.708
TAYLOR: Baby "M" was rushed
to the hospital

16:53.742 --> 16:55.210
before that day arrived.

16:55.244 --> 16:56.245
When I was notified,

16:56.278 --> 16:58.913
I went immediately
to the emergency room myself.

16:58.947 --> 17:00.682
You can imagine what I felt

17:00.715 --> 17:01.916
when I saw that this child

17:01.950 --> 17:02.751
had nearly been murdered.

17:02.784 --> 17:04.586
Objection, move to strike.

17:04.618 --> 17:06.988
FREEMAN: Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

17:07.021 --> 17:08.957
Just tell us
what you observed.

17:09.624 --> 17:11.193
We did a C. T. scan,

17:11.226 --> 17:13.895
which showed severe
swelling of the brain,

17:13.928 --> 17:15.564
the kind of swelling
we'd expect

17:15.597 --> 17:17.732
when a child
is shaken violently.

17:17.766 --> 17:20.234
In addition, baby "M"'s arms
were bruised,

17:20.269 --> 17:23.771
consistent with being held
tightly in that area.

17:23.805 --> 17:25.973
But most telling
was the bilateral

17:26.007 --> 17:27.175
retinal hemorrhaging.

17:27.209 --> 17:29.344
What would cause
the hemorrhaging?

17:29.378 --> 17:32.114
TAYLOR: In an infant?
Aggressive shaking.

17:32.147 --> 17:33.715
The force of such movement

17:33.748 --> 17:35.584
is more than enough
to cause injury.

17:35.617 --> 17:38.053
It's my medical opinion
that baby "M"

17:38.087 --> 17:39.588
was shaken almost to death.

17:40.089 --> 17:41.623
GAMBLE: Is there any way
to determine

17:41.656 --> 17:43.525
when the incident occurred?

17:43.558 --> 17:45.660
Not with precision,
but based on my experience,

17:45.694 --> 17:47.662
it's my opinion
that this occurred

17:47.696 --> 17:49.564
no more than 12 hours

17:49.598 --> 17:52.000
prior to baby "M"'s arrival
at the hospital.

17:52.034 --> 17:54.236
Did you mention that
to Mr. Goss?

17:54.269 --> 17:56.671
TAYLOR: Yes. He said
it was impossible,

17:56.705 --> 17:59.341
that the baby hadn't been
out of his sight all day.

18:02.077 --> 18:03.178
YOUNG: Dr. Taylor...

18:03.212 --> 18:06.715
isn't it possible that this
child's injuries occurred

18:06.748 --> 18:09.884
a full 72 hours prior

18:09.918 --> 18:11.386
to her arrival
at the hospital?

18:11.420 --> 18:13.055
That's extremely unlikely.

18:13.088 --> 18:16.125
The question
is whether it's possible.

18:16.158 --> 18:18.927
Shaken baby syndrome
can manifest itself

18:18.960 --> 18:19.994
up to three full days

18:20.028 --> 18:22.497
after the baby's
been shaken, correct?

18:22.531 --> 18:24.066
That's very rare.

18:24.099 --> 18:25.467
YOUNG: But you don't
have any idea

18:25.500 --> 18:27.102
who handled that baby
in the three days

18:27.136 --> 18:28.570
before the crisis, do you?

18:28.603 --> 18:29.838
No, I don't.

18:29.871 --> 18:31.806
YOUNG: You claim
you saw bruising

18:31.840 --> 18:32.874
on the child's leg,

18:32.907 --> 18:34.476
and even more
pronounced bruises

18:34.509 --> 18:35.844
on the next several visits.

18:35.877 --> 18:37.346
TAYLOR: Yes, and as
I'm sure you know,

18:37.379 --> 18:39.614
you can find those noted
in her chart.

18:39.648 --> 18:41.383
YOUNG: If you'd become
so concerned,

18:41.416 --> 18:43.518
why didn't you notify
Social Services

18:43.552 --> 18:45.920
prior to the date
of the emergency?

18:45.954 --> 18:47.422
I wish to God I had.

18:47.456 --> 18:50.159
But at the time,
I couldn't be sure of abuse.

18:50.192 --> 18:51.626
YOUNG: Yes, but you
aren't any more sure now

18:51.660 --> 18:52.361
than you were then.

18:52.394 --> 18:53.862
Those bruises were consistent

18:53.895 --> 18:55.297
with abuse, Mr. Young.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.400
When I arrived at the hospital
to evaluate the baby,

18:58.433 --> 19:01.736
I had no doubt whatsoever
she was shaken.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.139
And you know that because you
saw the swelling of the brain

19:04.173 --> 19:05.507
as well as the retinal
hemorrhaging?

19:05.540 --> 19:07.809
TAYLOR: That's correct.
Well, couldn't the swelling

19:07.842 --> 19:08.677
have been caused

19:08.710 --> 19:10.245
by a cerebral aneurysm?

19:10.279 --> 19:11.846
I conducted a C. T. scan.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.316
I would have seen
an aneurysm on that scan.

19:14.349 --> 19:15.884
What's more,
an aneurysm alone

19:15.917 --> 19:17.719
wouldn't explain
retinal hemorrhaging.

19:17.752 --> 19:20.055
YOUNG: Isn't it possible,
if not likely

19:20.089 --> 19:21.890
that a loving father,
in shock

19:21.923 --> 19:24.793
upon seeing that
his child isn't breathing,

19:24.826 --> 19:28.029
might lift up that child
and try reviving her,

19:28.063 --> 19:29.664
and in that moment of fear,

19:29.698 --> 19:31.166
produce the retinal
hemorrhaging

19:31.200 --> 19:32.034
of which you're
talking about?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.368
I highly doubt that.

19:33.402 --> 19:35.104
YOUNG: You may doubt it,
but the fact is,

19:35.137 --> 19:38.773
you don't know to a medical
certainty when this happened.

19:38.807 --> 19:41.276
And unless you were there,
you don't know who,

19:41.310 --> 19:43.078
if anyone, is responsible.

19:43.112 --> 19:44.379
Objection, argumentative.

19:44.413 --> 19:45.414
Overruled.

19:45.447 --> 19:46.581
This could have been
an accident.

19:46.615 --> 19:48.083
This was not an accident.

19:48.117 --> 19:49.751
Then for all you know,
Doctor,

19:49.784 --> 19:52.387
Mrs. Goss is the one
who harmed her child.

19:52.421 --> 19:54.256
Kelly would never hurt
our daughter!

19:54.289 --> 19:55.724
Please, don't listen to them!

19:55.757 --> 19:57.092
Mr. Goss, sit down!

19:57.126 --> 19:58.893
I told them you
couldn't have done this!

19:58.927 --> 20:00.929
Mr. Goss!
We love our daughter!

20:00.962 --> 20:02.197
Why won't you believe me?!

20:02.231 --> 20:03.465
WASHINGTON:
Tom, sit down.

20:08.037 --> 20:10.305
Sit down.

20:21.450 --> 20:24.719
If anyone's got an idea,
don't hold back now.

20:24.753 --> 20:26.388
The wife ran
from the courtroom?

20:26.421 --> 20:27.789
She's afraid of her husband,

20:27.822 --> 20:29.591
that's what the jury's
gonna think, anyway.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.126
Didn't Eugene cut down
the paramedic

20:31.160 --> 20:32.861
and make good points
with the Doctor?

20:32.894 --> 20:34.629
YOUNG: He's Chief
of Pediatrics, Jimmy,

20:34.663 --> 20:35.564
not some intern.

20:35.597 --> 20:36.531
He was effective.

20:36.565 --> 20:38.300
And any points I made
were forgotten

20:38.333 --> 20:39.101
when Tom lost control.

20:39.134 --> 20:41.370
Is it really that bad?

20:41.403 --> 20:42.804
It's not good.

20:42.837 --> 20:45.240
And right now,
Tom Goss is our biggest problem.

20:45.274 --> 20:46.975
Why not have him testify?

20:47.008 --> 20:49.144
YOUNG: That's not an option.
He's too unpredictable.

20:49.178 --> 20:50.645
Okay.
So who do they have next?

20:50.679 --> 20:52.147
YOUNG: The wife.
Rebecca, you ready?

20:52.181 --> 20:53.315
I'll do what I can.

20:53.348 --> 20:55.450
DONNELL: Rebecca,
we need this.

20:55.484 --> 20:59.054
I understand,
but Tom is still the key.

20:59.088 --> 21:01.890
If he won't give us anything
to attack her with on cross,

21:01.923 --> 21:03.092
he's going to prison.

21:06.661 --> 21:07.996
(knocks on door)

21:15.904 --> 21:17.306
Are you stalking me now?

21:18.073 --> 21:19.508
I need to speak with you.

21:20.275 --> 21:22.177
I've been standing outside
for over an hour.

21:23.312 --> 21:25.180
You're pathetic,
you know that?

21:28.450 --> 21:30.785
Come in and warm up
before I kick you out.

21:41.330 --> 21:44.433
MITCH: The cops did a more
thorough background check.

21:44.466 --> 21:46.401
Seems Catherine Kim's
been involved

21:46.435 --> 21:48.137
in two similar incidents
prior to this one.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.272
I've advised my client
to sue.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.444
What you said
this afternoon,

21:56.945 --> 21:58.613
I want you to know
I heard you.

22:01.050 --> 22:02.851
But I also
want you to know,

22:04.319 --> 22:06.988
immediately after what happened
in Kittleson's courtroom,

22:08.423 --> 22:12.894
I started to take stock
of myself.

22:15.297 --> 22:17.299
My divorce is final
in three weeks.

22:18.967 --> 22:20.802
This is my last case
with the D. A.'s office.

22:20.835 --> 22:21.570
I quit today.

22:24.806 --> 22:25.974
If I--

22:27.342 --> 22:29.044
if I was capable

22:29.611 --> 22:31.346
of propositioning you

22:31.380 --> 22:33.648
in exchange
for a lighter sentence,

22:34.749 --> 22:36.218
I mean if I was able
to betray

22:36.251 --> 22:37.852
our close friendship
like that,

22:37.886 --> 22:39.388
then I needed
to examine my life.

22:43.125 --> 22:44.259
Ellenor...

22:48.029 --> 22:49.464
I am so...

22:50.265 --> 22:51.500
so sorry.

22:59.308 --> 23:02.344
(inhales deeply)

23:14.856 --> 23:17.792
(machine beeping)

23:27.069 --> 23:29.571
GAMBLE: Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

23:30.004 --> 23:32.274
It's okay.
You just left court so quickly.

23:32.307 --> 23:33.942
I thought
I'd find you here.

23:35.277 --> 23:37.579
Is there anything
I can do to help?

23:38.913 --> 23:40.515
Would you sit here
with me?

23:41.283 --> 23:42.651
You don't need to stay long.
Just--

23:42.684 --> 23:44.153
Of course.

23:45.154 --> 23:50.459
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. (indistinct)

23:50.492 --> 23:52.494
I keep hearing
Dr. Taylor

23:53.395 --> 23:55.364
about how Mary Beth
will probably

23:55.397 --> 23:56.665
never walk...

23:57.032 --> 23:58.267
or talk.

23:59.701 --> 24:01.336
Is that a life?

24:03.472 --> 24:05.006
God, maybe things would
have been different

24:05.040 --> 24:06.808
if I had just...

24:07.376 --> 24:09.944
GAMBLE: Look,
you can't blame yourself

24:09.978 --> 24:11.746
for your daughter
being in a coma.

24:15.817 --> 24:17.619
I don't know what to do.

24:17.652 --> 24:20.355
GAMBLE: Well, right now there's
no reason to do anything.

24:20.389 --> 24:22.124
If I take her off
the respirator--

24:22.157 --> 24:23.958
I'm suggesting you wait.

24:25.527 --> 24:26.995
(sighs) Should I talk to Tom?

24:28.763 --> 24:30.232
You can't.

24:30.265 --> 24:32.000
There's a restraining order.

24:32.034 --> 24:33.001
(alarm ringing)

24:33.035 --> 24:33.902
What's wrong?

24:35.137 --> 24:36.305
What's happening?
What's happening?

24:36.571 --> 24:37.839
Somebody get a doctor!

24:37.872 --> 24:39.241
Somebody, please!

24:39.274 --> 24:42.177
Help my baby!
NURSE: Doctor, her baby!

24:42.211 --> 24:44.579
NURSE : She has a low
(indistinct) check it now.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.014
KELLY: Oh, what's happening?

24:46.915 --> 24:48.383
What's happening?

24:49.218 --> 24:52.154
(music playing)

25:59.654 --> 26:00.822
Wow.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.692
The most bizarre thing
just happened.

26:03.992 --> 26:05.860
I thought I saw
Mitchell Wheeler

26:05.894 --> 26:07.862
running out of here
half-dressed.

26:07.896 --> 26:10.032
That was Mitchell and I know
what you're gonna say.

26:10.065 --> 26:11.966
I don't know
what I'm going to say.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.202
I know. It seems crazy.

26:16.238 --> 26:18.407
I was in love with Mitchell
all through college.

26:18.807 --> 26:21.343
We were really close

26:21.743 --> 26:22.911
and we studied together.

26:22.944 --> 26:24.146
We slept on
each other's couches.

26:24.179 --> 26:26.115
He flirted with me
all the time.

26:27.082 --> 26:28.250
But he never--

26:29.718 --> 26:31.920
he always had some
trophy girl on his arm

26:33.122 --> 26:34.356
and then...

26:36.891 --> 26:38.560
last night it was just

26:39.228 --> 26:40.462
about so many things.

26:41.796 --> 26:44.099
Validation
for all of those years

26:44.133 --> 26:45.400
that I loved him

26:46.535 --> 26:49.171
and he made me
feel desirable

26:49.204 --> 26:50.872
that maybe...

26:50.905 --> 26:52.941
something like this
is possible for me.

26:56.078 --> 26:57.312
But honestly...

26:59.081 --> 27:01.916
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

27:04.786 --> 27:07.021
If it's what you wanted,

27:07.056 --> 27:08.557
I'm happy for you.

27:10.059 --> 27:12.227
But, Ellenor,
after what he did to you,

27:16.231 --> 27:17.866
it's none of my business.

27:28.277 --> 27:30.245
WASHINGTON: Your wife
was right there with her.

27:30.279 --> 27:31.380
Mary Beth?
She's all right?

27:31.413 --> 27:33.182
She's fine.
It was a small seizure.

27:33.215 --> 27:35.250
I wanna see my daughter.

27:35.284 --> 27:36.585
The judge can't do this.

27:36.618 --> 27:38.720
It is unfair
to Mary Beth or Kelly.

27:42.057 --> 27:43.558
I need to testify.

27:44.193 --> 27:46.595
I wanna tell my side
of what happened.

27:46.628 --> 27:48.530
You did damage to yourself
in court yesterday.

27:48.563 --> 27:49.598
The jury won't forget that.

27:49.631 --> 27:51.266
What better reason
for them to hear

27:51.300 --> 27:52.701
what I have to say
to explain--

27:52.734 --> 27:53.735
YOUNG: Explain what?

27:54.536 --> 27:56.071
How you lose control

27:56.771 --> 27:58.573
with your wife, with me,

28:00.309 --> 28:01.176
with your daughter?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.181
How can you say that?

28:06.215 --> 28:08.783
Right now,
nobody's gonna believe you.

28:10.385 --> 28:11.620
It's your decision.

28:12.421 --> 28:15.424
But my advice
is you sit in that court

28:15.457 --> 28:17.526
and keep quiet.

28:27.402 --> 28:29.238
The D. A. is putting your wife

28:29.271 --> 28:30.639
on the stand today.

28:31.606 --> 28:34.008
Tom, I have
to cross-examine her.

28:35.344 --> 28:36.411
No.

28:37.712 --> 28:39.948
You wanna cross-examine Kelly

28:40.682 --> 28:43.585
and suggest that
the mother of my child

28:43.618 --> 28:45.720
is responsible
for what happened.

28:50.659 --> 28:52.961
Tom, did you hurt your baby?

28:55.664 --> 28:56.698
No.

28:57.566 --> 28:59.268
Can you look me in the eye

28:59.301 --> 29:01.370
and tell me your wife didn't?

29:01.870 --> 29:04.806
(music playing)

29:11.780 --> 29:13.982
Then you owe it to your child

29:14.015 --> 29:16.685
to allow us to try
and find out the truth.

29:22.691 --> 29:24.459
Donnell, Young,
Dole, and Frutt.

29:24.493 --> 29:25.960
Yeah, just one moment.

29:25.994 --> 29:27.562
It's the doctor
from Boston General

29:27.596 --> 29:28.363
returning your call.

29:28.397 --> 29:29.631
Oh great.
Hi.

29:30.032 --> 29:30.932
Hello?

29:30.965 --> 29:33.202
Hi, thanks
for calling me back.

29:33.735 --> 29:35.304
Yeah, he's sitting
right here.

29:35.837 --> 29:36.871
Oh, good, great.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.907
What were you able
to find out? Uh-huh.

29:39.408 --> 29:40.642
Hey, Zoe.

29:40.675 --> 29:42.010
Your nanny canceled, too?

29:42.044 --> 29:43.378
Yeah, five car accidents

29:43.412 --> 29:45.180
got the Fitzgerald
backed up to Brooklyn.

29:45.214 --> 29:46.181
I told her
not to bother.

29:46.215 --> 29:47.149
Where are you going,
half-day?

29:47.182 --> 29:48.583
Half-day seminar,
Rape Crisis Center.

29:48.617 --> 29:49.551
Oh, who's gonna answer
the phone?

29:49.584 --> 29:51.053
I told you about this
a week ago.

29:51.086 --> 29:52.887
Honey, honey,
will you take the baby?

29:52.921 --> 29:53.988
Hmm.

29:54.289 --> 29:55.424
I'll try not to be
too long.

29:55.457 --> 29:56.491
Ellenor, we're going
to Boston General.

29:56.791 --> 29:58.193
Wait, is something wrong?
Nothing.

29:58.227 --> 29:59.561
I need your bad cop
for my good cop.

29:59.594 --> 30:01.163
Why am I always the bad cop?

30:01.196 --> 30:02.664
I'll explain on the way.

30:03.365 --> 30:05.200
Here.
Uh, uh, uh, no, no way.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.901
FRUTT: Your wife
has asked me to help.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.170
He needs
a diaper, okay?

30:08.203 --> 30:09.504
Hey, and if she's hungry,

30:09.538 --> 30:10.739
there are snacks
in the bag.

30:15.677 --> 30:17.712
Your Honor,
the prosecution calls

30:17.746 --> 30:19.348
Kelly Goss to the stand.

30:22.184 --> 30:23.618
Whatever happens,

30:23.652 --> 30:26.421
keep quiet
and just sit there.

30:32.594 --> 30:34.429
KELLY: The baby was crying...

30:34.963 --> 30:36.030
a lot.

30:36.898 --> 30:40.169
She wouldn't sleep
for more than an hour at a time.

30:41.103 --> 30:43.972
And with the visits
to Dr. Taylor's,

30:44.005 --> 30:45.840
the bills,

30:45.874 --> 30:48.077
Tom and I were falling apart.

30:48.643 --> 30:51.313
How did Tom adjust
to his new life?

30:51.346 --> 30:52.814
Not well.

30:53.182 --> 30:54.616
After losing his job,

30:54.649 --> 30:57.119
he always seemed
to be on edge.

30:57.386 --> 30:59.221
Uh, he has
a short temper anyway.

30:59.254 --> 30:59.888
Objection.

30:59.921 --> 31:01.056
Sustained.

31:01.856 --> 31:03.925
Did you ever see
your husband hit the baby

31:03.958 --> 31:05.794
or hurt her physically
in any way?

31:06.128 --> 31:07.996
No. But...

31:08.863 --> 31:10.699
he yelled at her
sometimes.

31:12.601 --> 31:14.769
I already said
she was crying all the time.

31:15.370 --> 31:16.638
GAMBLE: And during this time,

31:16.671 --> 31:18.440
how are you and your husband
getting along?

31:18.973 --> 31:20.475
We loved each other,

31:21.510 --> 31:23.312
but we had these fights.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.049
And once Tom was so upset,

31:27.449 --> 31:28.883
he said he felt trapped

31:28.917 --> 31:30.952
and he wished that we'd never
even had the baby.

31:31.953 --> 31:33.622
I don't think he meant it,

31:33.655 --> 31:36.225
but he said it
and it scared me.

31:37.092 --> 31:38.727
GAMBLE: What was your
daughter's condition

31:38.760 --> 31:41.363
the night before she was taken
to the emergency room?

31:41.963 --> 31:44.499
Well, she was crying
almost constantly.

31:45.067 --> 31:46.801
We were up
most of the night.

31:47.269 --> 31:49.471
Finally,
about 4:00 in the morning,

31:49.504 --> 31:50.805
she quieted down.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.507
And I didn't see her

31:52.541 --> 31:54.109
before I went to work
the next day.

31:55.110 --> 31:57.011
GAMBLE: When was the next time
you saw her?

31:58.447 --> 31:59.981
That night at the hospital.

32:04.886 --> 32:07.722
Mrs. Goss, your husband
wasn't the only one

32:07.756 --> 32:09.158
falling apart, was he?

32:09.891 --> 32:11.793
Things were hard
on both of us.

32:11.826 --> 32:13.695
In fact,
after giving birth,

32:13.728 --> 32:15.530
you suffered from
postpartum depression,

32:15.564 --> 32:16.365
isn't that right?

32:16.398 --> 32:17.999
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

32:18.033 --> 32:20.302
A little leeway.
I'll show the relevance.

32:20.735 --> 32:22.304
With caution, Counsel.

32:22.904 --> 32:24.206
You were so depressed

32:24.239 --> 32:25.474
you started drinking,
didn't you?

32:25.507 --> 32:28.177
My drinking
was never a problem.

32:28.210 --> 32:29.844
You were reprimanded at work.

32:29.878 --> 32:30.812
You nearly lost your job.

32:30.845 --> 32:32.214
I hated my job.

32:32.714 --> 32:33.982
And when I came home
at night,

32:34.015 --> 32:35.650
there was even more work
with the baby.

32:35.684 --> 32:37.452
And that made you angry,
didn't it?

32:38.253 --> 32:39.521
You fought
with your husband

32:39.554 --> 32:41.156
because he was concerned

32:41.190 --> 32:43.258
you were losing control.

32:43.292 --> 32:46.295
I would never harm
my child.

32:46.761 --> 32:50.632
Mrs. Goss, one week prior
to the emergency,

32:50.665 --> 32:51.966
did you shake your baby

32:52.000 --> 32:53.602
outside the apartment
in the hall?

32:54.236 --> 32:55.237
What?

32:55.270 --> 32:57.539
WASHINGTON: You were juggling
a bag of groceries

32:57.572 --> 32:59.308
and your daughter was crying?
GAMBLE: Your Honor?

32:59.341 --> 33:00.875
WASHINGTON: You heard
the phone ring inside

33:00.909 --> 33:02.144
and you had trouble
with the door.

33:02.177 --> 33:03.412
Your Honor, objection.

33:03.445 --> 33:04.313
FREEMAN: Overruled.

33:04.346 --> 33:06.748
Wasn't your neighbor
standing in the hall

33:06.781 --> 33:08.517
and didn't she see you

33:08.550 --> 33:10.352
shake your baby

33:10.385 --> 33:11.686
in anger and frustration?

33:11.720 --> 33:13.722
Absolutely not.
That isn't true.

33:13.755 --> 33:15.724
The night before
the emergency,

33:15.757 --> 33:18.360
you said your daughter kept you
awake for most of the night

33:18.393 --> 33:20.329
until she fell asleep
about 4:00 in the morning?

33:20.362 --> 33:21.563
That's right.

33:22.064 --> 33:23.132
Mrs. Goss,

33:23.765 --> 33:25.700
weren't you the last one

33:25.734 --> 33:27.602
to look in on your child
that night?

33:28.470 --> 33:30.905
Your daughter was crying
when you went in,

33:30.939 --> 33:34.243
but she wasn't crying
when you came out.

33:34.276 --> 33:38.613
Your little baby didn't cry
the rest of the night, did she,

33:38.647 --> 33:42.584
or the next morning
when, by your own testimony,

33:42.617 --> 33:44.553
you left for work

33:44.586 --> 33:47.289
without even going back
into that room

33:47.322 --> 33:49.158
and checking in on her?

33:49.891 --> 33:52.627
I would never ever

33:52.661 --> 33:54.429
hurt my baby.

34:00.935 --> 34:02.371
I have nothing further.

34:07.642 --> 34:09.844
Before any redirect,

34:09.878 --> 34:12.147
we'll take a 20-minute recess.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.985
(indistinct chatter)

34:21.523 --> 34:24.293
Eugene, are you still
crossing Mrs. Goss?

34:24.326 --> 34:25.494
Just finished.

34:25.527 --> 34:27.596
Well, you'll need
to recall a witness.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.507
You confirmed this?

34:39.541 --> 34:41.176
GAMBLE: We've checked into it,
Your Honor.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.078
It's all been confirmed.
Yes.

34:43.112 --> 34:44.346
How could this happen?

34:44.379 --> 34:45.813
(knocks on door)

34:45.847 --> 34:47.616
I think we're about
to find out.

34:48.817 --> 34:49.784
Come in.

34:49.818 --> 34:50.885
(door opens)

34:52.920 --> 34:54.123
Hello, everyone.

34:55.424 --> 34:57.526
FREEMAN: Dr. Taylor,
I asked you here

34:57.559 --> 35:00.028
because there's been
a development.

35:01.730 --> 35:02.831
Ms. Gamble?

35:03.165 --> 35:05.400
Baby "M" had
a seizure last night

35:05.434 --> 35:07.402
and again
early this morning.

35:07.436 --> 35:10.172
Apparently, the hospital
ran some tests.

35:10.205 --> 35:11.173
On whose authority?

35:11.206 --> 35:12.841
I wasn't informed
of any of this.

35:12.874 --> 35:15.210
On the authority
of Kelly Goss.

35:15.810 --> 35:16.845
WASHINGTON:
The tests show the baby

35:16.878 --> 35:19.048
actually suffers
from meningococcemia.

35:20.749 --> 35:22.717
Did I say that correctly,
Dr. Taylor?

35:23.385 --> 35:24.519
The illness presents

35:24.553 --> 35:26.855
with most of
the same symptoms.

35:27.422 --> 35:29.124
Look over the record,
if you'd like.

35:29.991 --> 35:33.228
A spinal tap revealed
diffused encephalitis.

35:41.570 --> 35:42.671
You can't blame me for this.

35:43.238 --> 35:44.906
Based on the parents
and the child's history

35:44.939 --> 35:46.441
and the symptoms that I saw,

35:46.475 --> 35:48.477
my diagnosis
is completely justifiable.

35:48.943 --> 35:49.844
You blew it.

35:50.212 --> 35:52.314
What gives you the right
to tell me what--

35:52.347 --> 35:54.183
If you'd have caught
this early,

35:54.216 --> 35:56.951
a simple course of antibiotics
would have been enough.

35:56.985 --> 35:58.620
But you didn't catch it

35:58.653 --> 35:59.821
because you didn't look.

35:59.854 --> 36:02.891
And you didn't look
because you'd seen enough.

36:03.558 --> 36:05.294
As far as
you were concerned,

36:05.327 --> 36:07.529
the parents
were not only suspect,

36:07.562 --> 36:08.697
the father was guilty.

36:08.730 --> 36:09.831
And as a result,

36:09.864 --> 36:12.367
you almost killed
their child.

36:17.272 --> 36:18.507
You blew it.

36:27.616 --> 36:28.950
FRUTT: You don't waste time.

36:29.818 --> 36:30.785
MITCH: Hey.

36:36.158 --> 36:37.892
You're not
a little scared?

36:38.460 --> 36:39.694
(chuckles)

36:39.728 --> 36:40.829
No.

36:42.964 --> 36:44.366
I'm terrified.

36:45.067 --> 36:47.069
Maybe that's why I'm only
running away for a week.

36:48.603 --> 36:49.771
Where'd you decide to go?

36:50.105 --> 36:51.106
Scotland.

36:52.207 --> 36:54.276
I've wanted to visit
for as long as I could remember.

36:54.543 --> 36:55.210
Plus...

36:55.844 --> 36:57.079
It's far away.

36:58.647 --> 36:59.681
There's that.

37:03.585 --> 37:05.087
Do you regret last night?

37:09.023 --> 37:10.059
No.

37:12.026 --> 37:13.162
Come with me.

37:15.230 --> 37:16.498
"Come with me?"

37:22.937 --> 37:27.276
There was a time that
I would have sold my soul

37:27.309 --> 37:28.777
to hear you
say that to me.

37:33.082 --> 37:34.349
Come with me.

37:36.651 --> 37:37.819
Mitchell...

37:40.689 --> 37:42.057
I don't trust you.

37:44.593 --> 37:46.628
I may love you,
but I don't trust you.

37:46.661 --> 37:47.762
Not now.

37:47.796 --> 37:48.963
MITCH: Oh, Ellie...

37:49.398 --> 37:51.600
I've wasted so much time.

37:52.767 --> 37:54.169
But you have to forgive me.

37:54.736 --> 37:56.771
It's not a question
of forgiveness.

37:56.805 --> 37:58.973
You have that,
or I wouldn't be here.

38:00.642 --> 38:02.811
And I can't believe
I'm saying this

38:02.844 --> 38:03.878
after all these years,

38:05.580 --> 38:09.851
but I am not willing

38:09.884 --> 38:12.721
to risk myself
or my daughter

38:12.754 --> 38:14.489
for something I have never

38:14.523 --> 38:16.325
been able to trust
in the past.

38:22.497 --> 38:24.233
It's a brave thing
what you're doing.

38:24.266 --> 38:25.967
A necessary thing.

38:27.769 --> 38:29.838
But you can't do it
with me.

38:31.606 --> 38:33.142
Then I wanna change that.

38:34.643 --> 38:35.777
Ellie...

38:37.011 --> 38:38.513
if nothing else...

38:41.316 --> 38:45.420
please believe that
my love for you is real.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.403
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

39:12.081 --> 39:13.348
Goodbye, Mitchell.

39:14.249 --> 39:17.186
(music playing)

39:41.910 --> 39:44.846
(machine beeping)

39:44.879 --> 39:46.681
GAMBLE: Six years ago,
I took my grandmother

39:46.715 --> 39:48.083
off life-support.

39:50.719 --> 39:53.122
I've regretted it
ever since.

39:53.155 --> 39:55.090
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Bullet to X-ray.

39:55.124 --> 39:56.791
Dr. Bullet to X-ray.

39:56.825 --> 39:58.927
You wondered
if this is a life?

40:00.229 --> 40:01.696
Kelly,
you and your husband

40:01.730 --> 40:04.099
created this life
together.

40:06.335 --> 40:08.137
And although
I can't even imagine

40:08.170 --> 40:11.206
how painful it must be
to see what's happened,

40:13.108 --> 40:16.978
and to know
she won't get much better,

40:17.011 --> 40:18.513
she's still your baby.

40:21.283 --> 40:23.185
The sickness
and Dr. Taylor,

40:23.218 --> 40:25.320
this case...

40:25.354 --> 40:27.189
it almost cost you
your daughter

40:27.222 --> 40:28.623
and your marriage.

40:30.392 --> 40:32.294
I don't know.

40:32.327 --> 40:33.362
Maybe too much
has happened

40:33.395 --> 40:37.332
between you
and your husband, but...

40:37.366 --> 40:38.867
well, at least try

40:38.900 --> 40:41.070
to get through it
together.

40:44.173 --> 40:45.674
You deserve that.

40:49.644 --> 40:51.113
So does Mary Beth.

40:51.146 --> 40:54.083
(music playing)

41:15.637 --> 41:17.072
Good luck, Mr. Goss.

41:17.572 --> 41:20.509
(music playing)

42:11.493 --> 42:13.128
YOUNG: Next on The Practice.

42:13.162 --> 42:15.029
Mr. McIntyre, he was like
an uncle to me.

42:15.064 --> 42:16.765
This man
killed your father.

42:16.798 --> 42:18.100
I don't wanna sound flip

42:18.133 --> 42:19.201
but that isn't much
of an uncle.

42:19.234 --> 42:21.203
CHARLES:
I saw Mr. McIntyre's photo

42:21.236 --> 42:23.372
in the newspaper
yesterday morning,

42:23.405 --> 42:26.108
he just isn't
who I saw that night.

42:26.141 --> 42:27.742
You just screwed me over
in this case.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.778
And if McIntyre walks
because of it,

42:29.811 --> 42:32.214
I'm gonna take that
very personally.

42:33.148 --> 42:34.849
They plead it down
to a misdemeanor.

42:35.350 --> 42:37.119
You don't have
to serve any time.

42:37.152 --> 42:38.720
You, you gave me
a second life.

42:39.521 --> 42:41.190
Stay away from this
kind of thing, okay?

42:41.223 --> 42:42.457
Yeah. Yeah.

42:42.991 --> 42:44.393
I got jammed up again.

42:44.426 --> 42:45.594
I'm really busy.

42:45.627 --> 42:47.762
Oh, I held up
a convenience store.

42:49.964 --> 42:52.901
(music playing)

43:16.325 --> 43:17.326
WOMAN: You stinker!
