00:14.639 --> 00:16.850
<i>is one of world's</i>
<i>foremost authorities</i>

00:16.891 --> 00:19.894
<i>in curling's rocky</i>
<i>but beautiful marriage</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:22.731
<i>of ice and stone.</i>

00:22.772 --> 00:26.901
<i>Olesen is USA curling's</i>
<i>head ice technician</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:29.654
<i>which means he's responsible</i>
<i>for ensuring</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.615
<i>these meticulously</i>
<i>polished stones</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:36.786
<i>can be glided down the sheet</i>
<i>as smoothly as possible</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:40.081
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:45.420
<i>- We just keep manicuring it</i>
<i>until it's perfect.</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:46.671
<i>This is fun to do.</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:48.840
You know you're at
the highest level

00:48.882 --> 00:50.592
with the highest competitors.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.094
<i>We hold ourselves</i>
<i>to a super high standard,</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:55.889
<i>but I'm never satisfied.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:58.475
<i>- He's been pursuing</i>
<i>the perfect sheet of ice</i>

00:58.516 --> 01:00.727
<i>for almost 20 years,</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:04.105
<i>meaning events like this</i>
<i>are what he lives for.</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.733
<i>The best curlers</i>
<i>in the country,</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:09.819
<i>the United States</i>
<i>Olympic Trials.</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:14.282
<i>Six teams are here in Omaha.</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:16.576
<i>Only one can represent the US</i>

01:16.618 --> 01:20.080
<i>at the 2022 Olympic</i>
<i>Winter Games.</i>

01:20.121 --> 01:21.790
- Hard!
- Hard, right to it.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.958
<i>- As the defending</i>
<i>gold medalists,</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:27.504
<i>John Shuster and his team</i>
<i>are the favorites here.</i>

01:27.545 --> 01:28.922
<i>Though the target</i>
<i>on their back</i>

01:28.963 --> 01:31.424
<i>only adds to the pressure</i>
<i>of the occasion.</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:33.593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.387
<i>After all, they play a game</i>

01:35.428 --> 01:38.306
<i>that has a habit</i>
<i>of laughing at expectations</i>

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
<i>with no place for sentiment.</i>

01:40.266 --> 01:41.559
Push.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.395
<i>- Because the perfect</i>
<i>sheet of ice</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:46.606
<i>is the ultimate</i>
<i>level playing field...</i>

01:46.648 --> 01:47.899
Hard!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.442
<i>Where you never know</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:52.821
<i>where the story</i>
<i>will slide next.</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:05.458
<i>Omaha's known for</i>
<i>its steaks right?</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:07.335
<i>Well, if I may,</i>

02:07.377 --> 02:10.839
<i>there are certainly</i>
<i>high stakes this week in town</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:14.801
<i>as the trials get underway</i>
<i>in the heartland.</i>

02:14.843 --> 02:16.511
Made it.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.055
<i>- Team Shuster</i>
<i>decided to rent a house</i>

02:19.097 --> 02:21.433
<i>for their ten days here.</i>

02:21.474 --> 02:26.646
<i>A place to eat,</i>
<i>sleep, and bond</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:28.690
<i>while hopefully</i>
<i>charting a course</i>

02:28.732 --> 02:31.109
<i>to another Olympic Games.</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:32.444
<i>We realized the importance</i>

02:32.485 --> 02:34.571
of being in a space
like an Airbnb

02:34.612 --> 02:36.656
compared, you know,
to, like, hotel rooms.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.827
Spaghetti sauce and salsa
and more salsa and more salsa.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.412
<i>And having a place</i>
<i>where, you know--</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:44.039
<i>Matt and Chris and I</i>
<i>all love to cook--</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:45.540
<i>you know, prepare meals</i>

02:45.582 --> 02:46.875
<i>and have that kinda stuff</i>
<i>together as a team</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:47.959
<i>has been something that</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:49.627
we've found to be, you know,

02:49.669 --> 02:50.837
kinda therapeutic honestly

02:50.879 --> 02:52.881
in the middle
of this kinda stuff.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.801
<i>- I finally feel like</i>
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:59.137
It's just nice to kinda
just tune everything else out

02:59.179 --> 03:01.181
and kinda get into
tournament mode.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.224
<i>And it's been a while</i>
<i>since we played an arena</i>

03:03.266 --> 03:04.809
<i>so I'm excited.</i>

03:08.897 --> 03:10.857
<i>- Here at base camp,</i>
<i>they'll be fueled</i>

03:10.899 --> 03:15.487
<i>by a potent mixture</i>
<i>of adrenaline, protein,</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:18.907
<i>and should those</i>
<i>run short, caffeine.</i>

03:19.657 --> 03:21.868
- There's a lot of like science
that has gone into it.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.413
So I know like 55 grams
of coffee to one liter

03:25.455 --> 03:27.499
at the right grind size
at the right speed

03:27.540 --> 03:29.751
will give you, like,
the perfect cup of coffee.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.628
So that's what I go for.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.798
That's why I brought
all my tools of the trade.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.217
Shuster, you want
cream or something?

03:37.258 --> 03:40.679
<i>I'm more excited than nervous,</i>
<i>almost like anxious.</i>

03:40.720 --> 03:42.430
<i>Like I would've--</i>
<i>I wish we just got here</i>

03:42.472 --> 03:44.265
<i>and been like okay,</i>
<i>game one tonight.</i>

03:44.307 --> 03:45.767
I know how good we can be

03:45.809 --> 03:47.560
and I know how good
each one of us individually is.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.438
And when we play our best,
we're tough to beat.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.400
- Paris did all natural.
- Oh, I can tell, yeah.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.701
<i>- The trials is--</i>
<i>it's all or nothing.</i>

04:02.742 --> 04:04.828
<i>It's Beijing or bust.</i>

04:08.915 --> 04:10.458
You know, we--
I think we step it up a level

04:10.500 --> 04:12.335
when we get to these
bigger events.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.129
And I'm looking forward
to tomorrow

04:14.170 --> 04:15.380
and getting on the ice

04:15.422 --> 04:17.507
and getting those
practice shots in.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.426
And then it's game on.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.512
<i>- Yeah, it's an 11 minute ride</i>
<i>to the arena from here, so.</i>

04:28.560 --> 04:31.021
<i>- The chilly, fall</i>
<i>Nebraska weather</i>

04:31.062 --> 04:34.983
<i>would seem an appropriate</i>
<i>backdrop for the task at hand.</i>

04:35.025 --> 04:36.943
Whoo, frosty.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.696
<i>And while you might think</i>

04:39.738 --> 04:42.115
<i>that a sheet of ice</i>
<i>is a sheet of ice,</i>

04:42.157 --> 04:45.118
<i>every arena presents</i>
<i>its own atmosphere</i>

04:45.160 --> 04:46.995
<i>to get accustomed to,</i>

04:47.037 --> 04:50.665
<i>meaning the one practice</i>
<i>session each team is allotted</i>

04:50.707 --> 04:53.376
<i>serves as</i>
<i>a critical few hours.</i>

04:54.794 --> 04:57.380
- Is that where my other one
kinda curled to as well?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.467
For us, I think our biggest
challenge honestly

05:00.508 --> 05:02.802
is just gonna be
to figure out the ice

05:02.844 --> 05:04.846
<i>and get comfortable</i>
<i>on the ice.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:06.890
<i>Play our game and execute.</i>

05:08.767 --> 05:11.436
That's all right. No worries.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.605
<i>When I'm on the ice,</i>
<i>I'm just gonna be</i>

05:13.646 --> 05:15.857
<i>really trying to, like,</i>
<i>throw the rock,</i>

05:15.899 --> 05:18.485
<i>see what I see,</i>
<i>and throw it again</i>

05:18.526 --> 05:20.070
<i>and make sure that it's--</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:21.654
<i>that it's coming out</i>
<i>of my hand.</i>

05:21.696 --> 05:24.366
<i>And fine tune it</i>
<i>and get ready for a big week.</i>

05:24.407 --> 05:27.077
Get 'em all out of the way now.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.870
All right, now I know
where that goes.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.913
Sheesh.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.377
<i>- They're primed</i>
<i>for the spotlight,</i>

05:35.418 --> 05:37.212
<i>intently focused</i>

05:37.253 --> 05:38.630
<i>and yet at peace</i>

05:38.672 --> 05:41.800
<i>with the uncertainty</i>
<i>that surrounds them,</i>

05:41.841 --> 05:45.053
<i>knowing, perhaps better than</i>
<i>anybody in the world,</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:46.805
<i>that anything can happen</i>

05:46.846 --> 05:48.932
<i>once the stone</i>
<i>and brooms come out.</i>

05:57.399 --> 06:01.194
<i>- Night one of</i>
<i>the US Olympic Curling Trials</i>

06:01.236 --> 06:03.863
<i>and the ice is gleaming.</i>

06:03.905 --> 06:07.158
<i>Ice--ice does gleam, right?</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.953
<i>In any event,</i>
<i>this is what the lives</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:13.748
<i>of John Shuster and his team</i>
<i>have been pointing towards.</i>

06:13.790 --> 06:17.502
<i>Their chance to make</i>
<i>more history has arrived.</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:20.296
<i>- Here we are.</i>
<i>Whoo.</i>

06:20.338 --> 06:23.133
<i>- And the crowd tonight</i>
<i>will be another Team Shuster,</i>

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
<i>John's family.</i>

06:24.676 --> 06:27.887
<i>His wife, Sara,</i>
<i>mom, Jackie, dad, Tom,</i>

06:27.929 --> 06:30.515
<i>and sons, Luke and Logan.</i>

06:31.433 --> 06:34.144
- What's the first cheer
you're going to do for Dad?

06:34.185 --> 06:35.979
Our new one.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.989
That sign there, look at him.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.907
<i>It's nice to be back</i>
<i>in the same place</i>

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
<i>that you won it at before.</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
It's nerves
but also excitement.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.751
And I know John had texted me
today on the way here

06:57.792 --> 07:00.170
and said that the ice
was really good

07:00.211 --> 07:01.880
which is good for them

07:01.921 --> 07:03.965
<i>and maybe not so great</i>
<i>for their opponents.</i>

07:05.216 --> 07:07.427
<i>- Everyone has</i>
<i>made sacrifices.</i>

07:07.469 --> 07:12.182
So to be here and to be
all together and enjoying it

07:12.223 --> 07:15.685
is just--it's really special,
you know?

07:15.727 --> 07:17.604
<i>So we're ready for this.</i>

07:17.645 --> 07:20.190
We have some pretty--
got good seats.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.942
- Yeah.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.319
<i>- It's not how</i>
<i>most people get there,</i>

07:24.361 --> 07:26.071
<i>but for the nation's</i>
<i>top curlers,</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:28.406
<i>the road to Beijing</i>
<i>goes through Omaha.</i>

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
<i>It's night one, draw one</i>

07:30.492 --> 07:33.078
<i>at the US Olympic Team Trials</i>
<i>for curling.</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:36.206
<i>- We know that we can't</i>
<i>come out and play our B game</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:39.250
<i>and probably</i>
<i>make the Olympic team.</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.378
<i>In a short tournament</i>
<i>with not that many teams,</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:46.257
getting out to a good start
is very, very important.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
<i>- Sometimes when</i>
<i>the cameras are there,</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:52.597
you kinda up
your level of play.

07:52.639 --> 07:57.060
<i>We're gonna turn it on</i>
<i>once that first game starts.</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:16.329
<i>- 2018 gold medalists</i>
<i>John Shuster and his team</i>

08:16.371 --> 08:18.707
<i>kick off the event</i>
<i>against Team Brundidge.</i>

08:18.748 --> 08:22.293
<i>Certainly Shuster comes</i>
<i>into this event as a favorite.</i>

08:23.044 --> 08:26.673
<i>- There are six teams</i>
<i>vying for one Olympic spot.</i>

08:26.715 --> 08:28.341
Yup, yup, hard.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.427
<i>- Each will</i>
<i>play the other twice</i>

08:30.468 --> 08:33.555
<i>for a total of</i>
<i>ten round robin games.</i>

08:33.596 --> 08:36.850
<i>And then the best two</i>
<i>will face off in the final.</i>

08:36.891 --> 08:40.270
- It's good.
<i>- A good start is helpful.</i>

08:40.311 --> 08:42.981
<i>A great one</i>
<i>is probably better.</i>

08:43.023 --> 08:45.442
- Hard, Matt.
- Hard, Matty, gotta go.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.444
- Gotta go, Matt, all the way.
<i>- An opening three</i>

08:47.485 --> 08:50.947
<i>for the 2018 gold medalist</i>
<i>and his team.</i>

08:50.989 --> 08:52.824
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>Good start, buddy.</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:01.124
Whoo!

09:01.166 --> 09:03.460
<i>- We take a lot</i>
<i>of nursery rhymes</i>

09:03.501 --> 09:06.212
and just little songs.
We try to take the trending

09:06.254 --> 09:08.465
TikTok videos
and things like that.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.343
And just paraphrase them and
make new lyrics to everything.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.679
<i>So Luke actually made</i>
<i>our cheer for Chris Plys today</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:16.973
<i>with the Applebee's song.</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:32.280
- We are gonna win this.
It's 5-0.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.117
- Yeah, boy.
That a way, Matty.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.661
<i>Shuster up six nothing, now.</i>

09:45.960 --> 09:47.629
Attaboy, Matty. Beauty.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.049
<i>- They hit all the right notes</i>
<i>on the ice in their opener,</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:54.386
<i>producing not merely</i>
<i>a nine-nothing win,</i>

09:54.427 --> 09:57.847
<i>but a dominating statement</i>
<i>of intent.</i>

09:57.889 --> 09:59.349
<i>- I guess you could say</i>
<i>John Shuster's</i>

09:59.391 --> 10:02.644
<i>defense of his title</i>
<i>started out pretty well.</i>

10:02.686 --> 10:05.188
<i>- Anytime you put us</i>
<i>on championship ice,</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:08.692
<i>I think championship</i>
<i>Team Shuster shows up,</i>

10:08.733 --> 10:10.527
but yeah, good first game.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.654
- Dad! Dad!

10:12.696 --> 10:14.531
- What up, dude?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.616
- Hi, pal.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.077
<i>It's so much fun to be able</i>
<i>to hear my kids up there</i>

10:19.119 --> 10:20.453
<i>singing and yelling</i>

10:20.495 --> 10:21.871
<i>and "hi, Dads,"</i>
<i>and blowing kisses.</i>

10:21.913 --> 10:22.997
- We're gonna go
get a family membership

10:23.039 --> 10:24.416
- at the zoo tomorrow.
- Sounds good.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.377
- Count me in.
- All right.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.878
- All right.
- All right, buddy, one more?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.172
- I'll text you later.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.049
- I love you.
- All right.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.136
<i>- I'm Dad and husband first</i>
<i>and curler second.</i>

10:36.177 --> 10:38.013
- All right.
- We'll see you.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.556
- See ya, babe.
- Bye.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.099
- See you.
- All right.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.727
<i>- And that just helps me run</i>
<i>that I am doing this</i>

10:43.768 --> 10:45.061
<i>because I love it and it's fun</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:47.689
<i>and they're here</i>
<i>supporting it.</i>

10:51.860 --> 10:54.821
<i>- Shuster comes into this game</i>
<i>in a familiar position,</i>

10:54.863 --> 10:56.239
<i>undefeated at 3-0.</i>

10:56.281 --> 10:57.991
<i>- Yeah,</i>
<i>things are looking really good</i>

10:58.033 --> 10:59.534
<i>for Team Shuster right now.</i>

11:01.244 --> 11:03.830
<i>- If it sounds</i>
<i>counterintuitive to you</i>

11:03.872 --> 11:06.916
<i>that a curling team</i>
<i>can get hot,</i>

11:06.958 --> 11:09.002
<i>well you're overthinking it.</i>

11:12.630 --> 11:15.216
<i>Wow.</i>

11:15.258 --> 11:17.719
- Hard!
- Matt, Matt, Matt.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.638
<i>- How about a sensational shot</i>
<i>right now?</i>

11:20.680 --> 11:21.931
<i>That's a four ender</i>

11:21.973 --> 11:24.184
<i>and that'll make it 7-3</i>
<i>for Shuster.</i>

11:24.225 --> 11:26.895
- Once you, like, fall into
a rhythm or a groove curling,

11:26.936 --> 11:28.938
like, you kinda just know.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.940
Everything just
kinda works out.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.942
Like, I think we're all vibing.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.486
<i>It was really a good feeling</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:37.113
<i>rolling through that</i>
<i>round robin the way we did.</i>

11:37.155 --> 11:40.116
- Go ahead center.
Hard.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.452
<i>- Going hard now.</i>
- Push.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.828
Hard!

11:43.870 --> 11:46.539
<i>- Looks like a score</i>
<i>of three for Team Shuster.</i>

11:47.457 --> 11:50.377
<i>- I'd love to tell you</i>
<i>how dramatic it got.</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:54.631
<i>Find a highlight of a key play</i>
<i>at a critical moment,</i>

11:54.673 --> 11:56.591
<i>but the reality is</i>

11:56.633 --> 11:59.469
<i>in their first eight games</i>
<i>of round robin play,</i>

11:59.511 --> 12:04.391
<i>Team Shuster outscored</i>
<i>their opponents by 40 points.</i>

12:04.432 --> 12:07.769
<i>Their confidence seemingly</i>
<i>building with every slide.</i>

12:09.854 --> 12:11.064
You the man, baby.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.694
<i>- You know, I knew how good</i>
<i>this team that we have is.</i>

12:15.735 --> 12:18.154
I think everybody was
in a good headspace mentally.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.573
And it's kinda
one of those places

12:20.615 --> 12:23.326
<i>where it's easy</i>
<i>to get up for those games.</i>

12:23.368 --> 12:25.245
<i>We really started rolling</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:26.705
and that was probably
the earliest

12:26.746 --> 12:29.332
that we've ever started
rolling in a round robin.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.210
<i>And yeah, and you saw</i>
<i>the results of that roll.</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:36.589
<i>A smooth roll for sure.</i>

12:36.631 --> 12:39.467
<i>And an impressive</i>
<i>few nights of curling</i>

12:39.509 --> 12:42.387
<i>for the reigning</i>
<i>gold medalists,</i>

12:42.429 --> 12:45.015
<i>but the schedule lists</i>
<i>their next opponent</i>

12:45.056 --> 12:48.018
<i>as a feisty collection</i>
<i>of upstarts.</i>

12:48.810 --> 12:52.355
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>"The Young Bucks,"</i>

12:52.397 --> 12:55.275
<i>and they have little regard</i>
<i>for history.</i>

13:05.702 --> 13:08.371
<i>- Curling is not a game</i>
<i>that necessarily</i>

13:08.413 --> 13:10.749
<i>lends itself to perfection.</i>

13:10.790 --> 13:14.044
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>so far at the Olympic Trials,</i>

13:14.085 --> 13:16.796
<i>Team Shuster has</i>
<i>found an unlikely path</i>

13:16.838 --> 13:19.174
<i>to flawlessness,</i>

13:19.215 --> 13:20.842
<i>seemingly getting better</i>

13:20.884 --> 13:24.888
<i>with each successive trip</i>
<i>they take down the ice.</i>

13:24.929 --> 13:27.265
<i>No team in an Olympic Trials</i>

13:27.307 --> 13:31.353
<i>has ever finished</i>
<i>round robin play perfect.</i>

13:31.394 --> 13:35.190
<i>Yet they're two games away</i>
<i>from such a feat.</i>

13:35.231 --> 13:36.399
<i>We wanted to go undefeated</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:38.693
<i>through that round robin</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

13:38.735 --> 13:40.987
We've got a target on our back
'cause we're the gold medalists

13:41.029 --> 13:44.407
so we were like,
bring them on.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.202
<i>But you didn't really think</i>

13:47.243 --> 13:50.246
<i>we'd tell you a story</i>
<i>without tension</i>

13:50.288 --> 13:52.290
<i>or adversity</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:56.628
<i>or a worthy foil, did you?</i>

13:56.670 --> 13:58.129
<i>I suppose the truth is,</i>

13:58.171 --> 14:01.675
<i>we don't have</i>
<i>any control over it.</i>

14:02.425 --> 14:06.262
<i>But what we do have</i>
<i>is Korey Dropkin.</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:09.349
<i>- And there it is,</i>
<i>a big four for Korey Dropkin</i>

14:09.391 --> 14:10.934
<i>in the second end.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:13.186
<i>And it was all Korey Dropkin</i>
<i>wasn't it?</i>

14:13.228 --> 14:16.314
<i>- The 26 year old Dropkin</i>
<i>and his team</i>

14:16.356 --> 14:18.858
<i>live right down the road</i>
<i>from John Shuster</i>

14:18.900 --> 14:20.819
<i>in Duluth, Minnesota.</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:23.279
<i>In their eyes,</i>
<i>their elder neighbors</i>

14:23.321 --> 14:25.156
<i>have had their moment</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:27.450
<i>and it's time</i>
<i>for a new generation</i>

14:27.492 --> 14:30.495
<i>of curling rock stars</i>
<i>in America.</i>

14:30.537 --> 14:34.958
<i>- Korey Dropkin is your 2021</i>
<i>USA Curling National Champion.</i>

14:35.000 --> 14:36.751
<i>Young Bucks are on top.</i>

14:36.793 --> 14:38.336
<i>Dropkin and his team</i>

14:38.378 --> 14:41.798
<i>not only won Nationals</i>
<i>a few months back,</i>

14:41.840 --> 14:45.343
<i>they also gave themselves</i>
<i>a catchy nickname,</i>

14:45.385 --> 14:47.721
<i>"the Young Bucks."</i>

14:47.762 --> 14:50.140
<i>They're cool,</i>
<i>they're confident,</i>

14:50.181 --> 14:51.808
<i>and they're here in Omaha</i>

14:51.850 --> 14:56.229
<i>fully intent on taking over</i>
<i>this curling fairy tale.</i>

14:57.022 --> 14:58.982
<i>- Team Dropkin is</i>
<i>a great curling team.</i>

14:59.024 --> 15:01.026
And their style of play,
I feel like

15:01.067 --> 15:02.819
they really tried to mold that

15:02.861 --> 15:05.363
around something that
was gonna give us trouble.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.240
<i>I obviously like</i>
<i>our match up against anybody,</i>

15:07.282 --> 15:10.785
<i>but it was one of those things</i>
<i>where I didn't think maybe</i>

15:10.827 --> 15:12.245
<i>we'd have the advantage</i>
<i>that we usually do.</i>

15:12.287 --> 15:13.872
<i>And therefore, you know, maybe</i>

15:13.913 --> 15:16.416
<i>I had to make</i>
<i>some adjustments myself.</i>

15:16.458 --> 15:18.668
<i>- I don't think</i>
<i>Shuster wants to hand</i>

15:18.710 --> 15:21.171
<i>an easy one to Dropkin.</i>
<i>I know they won't.</i>

15:21.212 --> 15:22.630
<i>Expecting that</i>
<i>maybe he will face him</i>

15:22.672 --> 15:24.507
<i>in the best</i>
<i>two of three final.</i>

15:24.549 --> 15:25.717
<i>The last thing he wants</i>

15:25.759 --> 15:27.802
<i>is to let Korey</i>
<i>get some confidence.</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:35.185
- Quite a bit more.
- All right, that's good.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.770
That a ways.
That's nice there, bud.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.229
Oh, yeah. We'll take it.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.773
Nice shot, John.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.859
<i>- Team Dropkin is one of</i>
<i>the top teams in the country.</i>

15:42.901 --> 15:44.361
We've played them before.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.528
We've beat them before

15:45.570 --> 15:48.239
and we know that
we can do that again.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.532
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>- Should be close.</i>

15:49.574 --> 15:51.159
- <i>Stuffs it.</i>
- Good.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.537
<i>- So Polo gets the double</i>
<i>they were looking for.</i>

15:54.579 --> 15:56.956
- I mean, we're still
not in horrible shape.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.416
- Yeah.
- But it's obviously

15:58.458 --> 16:00.251
- not as good as it was.
- Port.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.337
- Good point.
- Point.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.924
<i>- Korey's team</i>
<i>and Korey himself,</i>

16:05.965 --> 16:07.717
<i>they're grinders.</i>

16:07.759 --> 16:09.594
<i>They're not the kinda team</i>
<i>that's just gonna to let you,</i>

16:09.636 --> 16:12.389
<i>like, run away with games.</i>

16:12.430 --> 16:16.017
They're a dangerous team
and I don't love playing them.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.936
Go!

16:17.977 --> 16:20.772
<i>- Now it's gonna come over.</i>
<i>Now can they get it there?</i>

16:20.814 --> 16:22.107
<i>It should walk in there.</i>
<i>It's close.</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:23.441
Yep. Whoa.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.360
<i>- And it's a big one</i>
<i>for Korey Dropkin.</i>

16:25.402 --> 16:27.612
<i>- What a shot.</i>
<i>- And it's 1-1.</i>

16:27.654 --> 16:30.365
<i>And a great shot</i>
<i>by Korey Dropkin.</i>

16:33.785 --> 16:35.161
That was not ideal.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.706
- Let's get--let's introduce
that I'm here.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.207
Yeah.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.878
<i>- There are benefits</i>
<i>to age and experience.</i>

16:43.920 --> 16:46.006
<i>Among them,</i>
<i>knowing the difference</i>

16:46.047 --> 16:50.969
<i>between young pretenders</i>
<i>and legitimate dangers.</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:54.222
<i>Unfortunately in this case,</i>
<i>Team Shuster knows</i>

16:54.264 --> 16:56.057
<i>its dealing with the latter.</i>

16:56.099 --> 17:00.437
<i>A talented opponent that</i>
<i>just doesn't get rattled.</i>

17:00.478 --> 17:01.813
Little bit aft. Careful.

17:01.855 --> 17:05.525
<i>- Team Dropkin hangs tough</i>
<i>all game long,</i>

17:05.567 --> 17:09.654
<i>and seems at their best</i>
<i>in all the biggest moments.</i>

17:09.696 --> 17:12.574
<i>- That's a steal of two</i>
<i>for Korey Dropkin.</i>

17:12.615 --> 17:14.868
Ooh.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.581
- Sheesh.
Sorry, man.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.832
<i>Big shot from John here.</i>

17:20.874 --> 17:22.917
- Not there.
- Oh, right off it.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.420
- What do you got?
- Lean.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.340
- Line's a little tight.
- Yep, line's losing it.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.134
- Keep going.
- Okay.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.720
<i>- That's gonna be a steal</i>
<i>of one for Korey Dropkin.</i>

17:33.762 --> 17:36.097
He just missed it.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.766
No sweeping today.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.977
<i>- Some chinks in the armor</i>
<i>for Team Shuster in this game.</i>

17:41.019 --> 17:45.023
<i>- Yeah, they're finally</i>
<i>showing some weakness.</i>

17:45.065 --> 17:47.275
- Just keep it chill, boys.
Just keep it chill.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.736
Don't show that
you're pissed off at all.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.863
That sucks.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.282
- These guys want to see
some frustration.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.369
Don't give them
the satisfaction.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.542
- Hard.
Hard all the way.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.461
- Hard, hard.
- Hard, hard.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.296
<i>- Get it close.</i>
<i>He does.</i>

18:08.338 --> 18:09.631
<i>- Pistol.</i>
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>

18:09.673 --> 18:11.508
<i>- What a shot.</i>
- Come on.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.967
<i>- And they're gonna</i>
<i>wrap that up.</i>

18:13.009 --> 18:15.053
<i>So Korey Dropkin</i>
<i>needed a big game,</i>

18:15.095 --> 18:17.555
<i>his whole team did.</i>
<i>He got a big game.</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:19.641
<i>They're directly</i>
<i>into the final,</i>

18:19.683 --> 18:21.726
<i>the best two of three final</i>
<i>against the team</i>

18:21.768 --> 18:25.480
<i>they just trounced,</i>
<i>to be honest, John Shuster.</i>

18:26.106 --> 18:29.025
<i>- All great stories</i>
<i>need conflict.</i>

18:29.067 --> 18:32.821
<i>All heroes need rivals</i>
<i>to test them,</i>

18:32.862 --> 18:35.990
<i>but narrative platitudes</i>
<i>aside,</i>

18:36.032 --> 18:40.036
<i>this turn in our tale</i>
<i>raises a question.</i>

18:40.078 --> 18:43.581
<i>A bump in the road</i>
<i>for our curlers</i>

18:43.623 --> 18:47.335
<i>or a sign of something</i>
<i>more ominous to come?</i>

18:47.377 --> 18:50.463
- Kind of sucked to go out
there and just get walked on.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.466
Um, it's never fun.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.260
But I think everybody
was just like, okay.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.137
On to the next one.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.097
We just got gob smacked.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.517
Just walked off the ice,
so let's start this playoff.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.687
<i>Let's get this show</i>
<i>on the road because</i>

19:05.729 --> 19:08.023
<i>I want to play these guys</i>
<i>while I'm still heated</i>

19:08.064 --> 19:10.066
<i>and it's fresh in my mind.</i>

19:21.911 --> 19:24.998
<i>- To win curling gold</i>
<i>for the United States</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:29.627
<i>in back to back Olympics,</i>
<i>John Shuster and his team</i>

19:29.669 --> 19:33.340
<i>first need to reach</i>
<i>back to back Olympics.</i>

19:33.381 --> 19:35.008
<i>The only way to do that</i>

19:35.050 --> 19:38.178
<i>is to win</i>
<i>these Olympic Trials.</i>

19:38.219 --> 19:40.347
<i>And now in our chronicle,</i>

19:40.388 --> 19:43.850
<i>a best of three final awaits.</i>

19:43.892 --> 19:45.602
<i>- Honestly,</i>
<i>I wasn't too worried at all.</i>

19:45.643 --> 19:48.438
We got choice of rocks
for two of the three games.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.732
We got hammer
for two of the three games.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.859
<i>All the advantages</i>
<i>were on our side</i>

19:52.901 --> 19:55.487
<i>going into</i>
<i>those finals playoffs.</i>

19:55.528 --> 19:58.198
<i>Second, Matt Hamilton.</i>

19:58.239 --> 20:00.492
<i>Third, Chris Plys.</i>

20:00.533 --> 20:03.119
<i>And skip, John Shuster.</i>

20:03.161 --> 20:04.245
<i>The nerves in Omaha</i>

20:04.287 --> 20:08.333
weren't as bad
as the last time in 2017.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.377
I don't think
we really felt that

20:10.418 --> 20:12.796
until that first playoff game.

20:14.673 --> 20:17.050
<i>- The reason for optimism</i>
<i>is that the fellas</i>

20:17.092 --> 20:18.885
- <i>only lost one game...</i>
- Yes.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.554
<i>During round robin play.</i>

20:21.596 --> 20:23.306
<i>The unsettling footnote</i>

20:23.348 --> 20:27.769
<i>is that they lost it</i>
<i>decisively to Team Dropkin.</i>

20:27.811 --> 20:32.399
<i>And in their finals rematch,</i>
<i>no one's forgotten that.</i>

20:32.440 --> 20:33.608
<i>Put on a show, man.</i>

20:34.776 --> 20:37.570
- Early and often.
- And often.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.239
- Go, buddy.
- Eat his lunch, buddy, yeah.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.449
<i>So we are ready to go.</i>

20:41.491 --> 20:43.576
<i>Red rocks here</i>
<i>for Team Dropkin.</i>

20:43.618 --> 20:45.954
<i>Yellow stones</i>
<i>for Team Shuster.</i>

20:45.995 --> 20:47.497
- Hup, hup.
Top hit right now.

20:47.539 --> 20:48.832
Okay, just clean then.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.751
- That first game
of the playoffs,

20:51.793 --> 20:53.628
you know, we went in
with that mindset

20:53.670 --> 20:55.547
and knowing we were
trying to score first

20:55.588 --> 20:58.758
<i>and kinda show those guys,</i>
<i>like, we're here to play.</i>

20:58.800 --> 21:00.844
<i>You know, like let's see</i>
<i>if you can match up to us.</i>

21:00.885 --> 21:02.762
- Get it in there, Lands.
- Keep going, keep going.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.264
- Watch the line.
- Little more.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.473
Good. That a boy, Matty.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.102
Good, Matty.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.603
Chef's kiss.

21:13.565 --> 21:17.527
<i>- But if Team Shuster brought</i>
<i>an aggressive mentality,</i>

21:17.569 --> 21:19.863
<i>the Young Bucks</i>
<i>have in their holster</i>

21:19.904 --> 21:22.615
<i>the approach to match.</i>

21:22.657 --> 21:24.325
<i>An approach</i>
<i>that puts the pressure</i>

21:24.367 --> 21:27.162
<i>right back on</i>
<i>the reigning gold medalists.</i>

21:28.246 --> 21:30.665
<i>Dropkin loves it.</i>

21:30.707 --> 21:32.834
<i>- Shuster trying</i>
<i>to avoid calamity</i>

21:32.876 --> 21:34.044
<i>here in the opening end.</i>

21:34.085 --> 21:36.838
- Got exactly what I need.
- Yeah.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.176
- Yup.
<i>- Last stone.</i>

21:41.217 --> 21:42.635
- Hard.
- Hard!

21:42.677 --> 21:44.637
- Hard!
- Oh, .

21:44.679 --> 21:47.932
<i>- And it clips the guard.</i>

21:47.974 --> 21:49.559
- Sorry.
- It's all right, John.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.644
<i>It'll be a steal of two</i>

21:51.686 --> 21:53.688
<i>and a massive beginning</i>

21:53.730 --> 21:56.316
<i>for the upset minded</i>
<i>Young Bucks.</i>

21:56.983 --> 21:57.901
- It's all right, guys.
- No worries.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.778
It's a lot of game here.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.196
It's all right. We got them.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.489
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.657
- Dropkin's team is just--

22:04.699 --> 22:06.159
they're frustrating
to play against.

22:06.201 --> 22:09.829
You know, they made us just
really pay for any mistakes.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.165
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.629
<i>- Just look at that.</i>
- That a boy, Chris.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.005
<i>- That's what it takes,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

22:19.047 --> 22:21.758
<i>when you have your competitors</i>
<i>curling so well.</i>

22:21.800 --> 22:23.093
<i>You've gotta make them</i>
<i>yourself.</i>

22:23.134 --> 22:25.470
- Nice shot, dude.
<i>- Nicely done.</i>

22:26.388 --> 22:29.557
<i>- So then, a shaky start</i>
<i>for Shuster and company.</i>

22:29.599 --> 22:30.809
Hard!

22:30.850 --> 22:32.310
<i>And an immediate referendum</i>

22:32.352 --> 22:35.647
<i>on not just their sharpness</i>
<i>but their guide</i>

22:35.689 --> 22:37.941
<i>in the second half.</i>

22:39.943 --> 22:41.695
Hold.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.947
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.824
- Go, Chis, go.
- Go, go, go.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.368
<i>Ply, sweeping hard</i>

22:48.410 --> 22:52.831
<i>but it'll only be one here</i>
<i>for John Shuster.</i>

22:52.872 --> 22:55.417
Shot, dude. That's good.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.377
<i>Team Shuster down one</i>

22:57.419 --> 23:00.672
<i>but has a little bit</i>
<i>of stuff going on here.</i>

23:00.714 --> 23:02.966
<i>- Back and forth.</i>
- Eight right now.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.217
<i>- Back and forth.</i>
- Seven.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.928
<i>- It's curling's</i>
<i>familiar rhythm,</i>

23:06.970 --> 23:10.223
<i>even when the results end up</i>
<i>favoring only one side.</i>

23:12.100 --> 23:14.936
- We're dead again.
- Yeah.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.063
<i>- No worries.</i>
<i>Good shot.</i>

23:17.105 --> 23:18.690
<i>Great end.</i>

23:18.732 --> 23:24.320
<i>- And the lead is stretched</i>
<i>to four here for the upstarts.</i>

23:24.362 --> 23:25.905
I got good news.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.324
A, two things, lots of game.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.702
- Lots of game.
- And B, there's three games.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.620
- Yeah.
- Three games.

23:33.580 --> 23:38.668
<i>- Dropkin still has</i>
<i>sizeable control of this game.</i>

23:38.710 --> 23:41.171
- I was just like,
Jesus, like,

23:41.212 --> 23:42.756
this is--I've gotta
figure this out

23:42.797 --> 23:45.091
or this is gonna be
a quick final.

23:45.133 --> 23:49.012
- It almost verified
even more of what I thought

23:49.054 --> 23:51.139
it was gonna take to win,
you know,

23:51.181 --> 23:52.682
<i>the series against those guys.</i>

23:52.724 --> 23:54.100
Go ahead, go ahead.

23:54.142 --> 23:58.104
It's gone, guys, it's gone.
What the heck?

23:58.146 --> 24:00.982
<i>- It's a game to forget</i>
<i>for Shuster</i>

24:01.024 --> 24:03.693
<i>who struggles with</i>
<i>not just the tough shots,</i>

24:03.735 --> 24:05.028
<i>but the elementary ones too.</i>

24:05.070 --> 24:06.988
- Stay low now.
Roll it just a little bit.

24:07.030 --> 24:10.367
<i>- All that confidence,</i>
<i>all that momentum,</i>

24:10.408 --> 24:13.661
<i>all of a sudden</i>
<i>a distant memory.</i>

24:13.703 --> 24:14.704
I'm sorry, fellas.

24:14.746 --> 24:15.663
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.123
It's frickin' pathetic.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.503
<i>You could definitely feel</i>

24:21.544 --> 24:23.838
that we were all a bit uptight

24:23.880 --> 24:27.300
and just not ready
for that game.

24:27.342 --> 24:31.638
<i>- Dropkin with</i>
<i>a dream opportunity.</i>

24:31.680 --> 24:34.557
<i>- Might be living a dream</i>
<i>right now if this holds.</i>

24:34.599 --> 24:36.851
- Oh, boy.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.895
<i>Phenomenal for Dropkin.</i>

24:38.937 --> 24:41.356
<i>Three more on the board</i>

24:41.398 --> 24:44.693
<i>and the Young Bucks</i>
<i>feeling it.</i>

24:45.485 --> 24:47.737
<i>- I don't think we gave up</i>
<i>more than two threes</i>

24:47.779 --> 24:51.074
all of the entire round robin

24:51.116 --> 24:54.119
and then here Korey is,
popping us for two

24:54.160 --> 24:55.912
in, like, a eight end game.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.997
<i>And it was kind of</i>
<i>a tough one to take.</i>

24:58.039 --> 25:00.417
<i>Uh, tough one to swallow.</i>

25:00.458 --> 25:02.335
- These guys ain't just
gonna roll over.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.295
No, no.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.548
- We're gonna have to
figure something out.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.926
<i>- So round one</i>
<i>goes to the Young Bucks.</i>

25:10.552 --> 25:12.804
<i>- Victory one</i>
<i>in the best of three finals</i>

25:12.846 --> 25:15.223
<i>goes to Team Dropkin.</i>

25:15.265 --> 25:17.851
<i>- Putting Team Shuster</i>
<i>in a familiar,</i>

25:17.892 --> 25:20.437
<i>if not desirable, predicament.</i>

25:20.478 --> 25:23.481
<i>Backs and brooms</i>
<i>against the wall,</i>

25:23.523 --> 25:26.192
<i>needing two straight wins</i>
<i>over a team</i>

25:26.234 --> 25:29.571
<i>that's held them at bay</i>
<i>with ease so far.</i>

25:29.612 --> 25:31.322
<i>- We know how to play</i>
<i>a smart game.</i>

25:31.364 --> 25:34.701
Make them make the tough shots
and let things flow from there.

25:34.743 --> 25:37.495
<i>In curling, just as in life,</i>

25:37.537 --> 25:40.957
<i>happy endings</i>
<i>are not promised.</i>

25:40.999 --> 25:42.375
<i>So, John Shuster,</i>

25:42.417 --> 25:44.461
<i>does he have</i>
<i>another comeback in him?</i>

25:44.502 --> 25:45.837
- We came all the way
from South Carolina, dude.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.213
Oh, appreciate it.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.923
Hey, that's why
it's the best of three, right?

25:48.965 --> 25:51.426
- Yeah.
- Still in it, still in it.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.386
Thank you, guys.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.763
Hey, check this out.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.393
Love you, buddy.

26:00.435 --> 26:01.686
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I knew that we just--</i>

26:01.728 --> 26:02.937
<i>we're gonna have</i>
<i>to buckle down</i>

26:02.979 --> 26:06.191
and take the wind
out of their sails.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.275
And I knew if we could do that,

26:07.317 --> 26:09.110
that we were gonna
give ourselves

26:09.152 --> 26:10.904
<i>a great chance</i>
<i>to turn this thing around.</i>

26:13.615 --> 26:18.411
<i>- Next time on the finale</i>
<i>of "American Rock Stars,"</i>

26:18.453 --> 26:20.663
<i>- Nervous times a bit</i>
<i>for Team Shuster.</i>

26:20.705 --> 26:21.790
- I'm just gonna go
right in for it.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.041
Let's do this, baby.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.419
<i>Shuster and Dropkin face off</i>

26:26.461 --> 26:30.590
<i>to get to the 2022 Winter</i>
<i>Olympic Games.</i>

26:30.632 --> 26:32.050
Hard, right to it.

26:34.719 --> 26:35.929
<i>- What a shot.</i>

26:35.970 --> 26:37.889
Nice shot, baby.

26:37.931 --> 26:40.100
<i>All I'll guarantee</i>

26:40.141 --> 26:43.103
<i>is an ice battle to remember.</i>
