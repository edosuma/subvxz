00:50.943 --> 00:53.034
Oh, my God!
I can't believe MEBR

00:53.128 --> 00:55.370
is finally releasing
her first song.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.057
-"MEBR"?
-Yes. Mary Elizabeth Becca Ryan.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.041
Her real fans call her MEBR.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.227
I've literally never heard
you talk about her.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.212
Talk about MEBR?
I'm always talking about MEBR.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.473
I love MEBR.
If I weren't such a big fan,

01:06.625 --> 01:09.359
would I have MEBR tattooed
right above my root?

01:10.796 --> 01:12.462
That is very low.

01:12.556 --> 01:14.815
Yeah. It's a root tattoo.
They're low.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.558
Brian, I have followed
her whole career

01:16.652 --> 01:18.726

pig who went "oink, oink"

01:18.746 --> 01:20.137
on<i> Jolly Farm.</i>

01:20.155 --> 01:22.081
I can't believe
it's the same girl.

01:22.232 --> 01:24.917
You know, all the<i> Jolly Farm</i>
kids grew up to be stars.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.919
Except for the ones
who went broke, OD'd,

01:27.070 --> 01:29.996

01:30.132 --> 01:33.150
But I'm all in on MEBR.
She is a superstar.

01:33.168 --> 01:34.742
I told you she'd grow up
to be hot.

01:34.911 --> 01:37.245
You couldn't say that then
and you can't say it now.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.723

01:45.998 --> 01:47.998

baseball players,

09:42.231 --> 09:44.824
And that means abandoning
the people who stuck with me

09:44.976 --> 09:46.233
through the fat years.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.235
You'll understand
when you're older.

09:48.330 --> 09:51.172
-Is there a bit of a smell?
-There's a bit of a smell.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.244
Hey, what's everyone thinking
for playtime?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.339
Hi. I'll speak for the group.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.825
We heard about
what you did, Stewie.

10:01.843 --> 10:04.510
No one wants to play with you.

10:04.663 --> 10:06.663
Okay. I see.

10:06.681 --> 10:09.608
I guess I'll just play with
this doctor's waiting room toy

10:09.835 --> 10:11.501
where you push a bead
along a wire.

10:11.594 --> 10:14.112
Plenty of room if anybody wants
to join.

10:14.263 --> 10:16.597
It's a multi-kid toy. Anybody?

10:16.691 --> 10:18.783
I already pushed the bead
through the double twist

10:18.935 --> 10:20.285
where it gets fast for a second.

10:20.436 --> 10:22.436
Scary part's over. Anybody?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.180
Preschool is supposed
to be more about

10:24.199 --> 10:25.865
socialization than education.

10:26.017 --> 10:28.460
This could have lasting
long-term damage. Anybody?

10:28.687 --> 10:31.020
They say kids
who aren't properly socialized

10:31.022 --> 10:32.797
by the age of five
can never catch up.

10:33.024 --> 10:34.615
Doctors agree. Anybody?

10:34.635 --> 10:37.043
It doesn't necessarily affect
financial outcomes,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.045
more affects stable
emotional relationships.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.306
There's a lot of literature
about it. Anybody?

10:41.457 --> 10:43.624
A long-term study out
of the University of Indiana

10:43.718 --> 10:45.827
backs this up. I know
that doesn't sound impressive,

10:45.887 --> 10:48.480
but all the Ivy League schools
couldn't find fault in it.

10:48.631 --> 10:50.273
Anybody?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.470
Go away, Brian.
I've already made my decision.

10:56.564 --> 10:59.140
There's nothing you can say
that will change my mind.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.217
You texted me to come outside.

11:01.236 --> 11:03.569
This whole ordeal has made
my life a living hell,

11:03.664 --> 11:05.071
and I no longer feel safe.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.999
So Rupert and I have decided
to lay low for a while.

11:08.151 --> 11:09.000
Where are you gonna go?

11:09.152 --> 11:10.576
We're going to a restorative

11:10.729 --> 11:12.170

11:12.397 --> 11:14.898
We will be unplugging our minds
and our bodies.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.917
Yes, Rupert, there will still be
one thing getting plugged.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.161
-(laughing)
-Oh, gosh.

11:20.255 --> 11:21.921
I know. This guy is twisted.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.498
Look, what's happened to you
is unfair.

11:24.576 --> 11:26.426
The Stewie Griffin I know
is a good person.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.912
And I want you to know
that I'm on your side.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.356
Thanks, Brian.
Can you tweet that?

11:31.507 --> 11:33.933
An online ally would be
really helpful right now.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.361
-I know, right?
-Someone publicly standing up

11:36.512 --> 11:38.254
for me could start
changing the conversation.

11:38.347 --> 11:40.181
-Totally.
-Just need one person.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.016
-All it takes is one.
-Could be you.

11:42.110 --> 11:44.110
-Yep.
-You're still not
taking out your phone.

11:44.187 --> 11:47.080
Look, my point is, I am here
for you right now, privately,

11:47.265 --> 11:49.098
and out of earshot

11:49.117 --> 11:50.767
You are gonna get
through this, champ.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.268
-Coward.
-And friend.

11:52.361 --> 11:53.770
I'm just gonna go grab
my sun hat,

11:53.863 --> 11:55.380

Boo! MEBR rules!

19:33.173 --> 19:34.655
Pretzel the baby!

19:34.674 --> 19:36.007
I'm one of her adult fans.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.249
(crowd booing, clamoring)

19:37.326 --> 19:38.992
Nice speech, Stewie.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.327
A lot of good it did.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.329
Look at them, they don't care.
They're lost.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.422
Well, you know,
people are desperate

19:43.591 --> 19:44.831
for connection, Stewie.

19:44.926 --> 19:47.334
Sometimes the only place
they can find it is online

19:47.503 --> 19:50.170
in parasocial relationships
with a celebrity.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.673
I just wish mine
didn't cost me Rupert.

19:52.808 --> 19:54.025
About that.

19:54.176 --> 19:56.527
I have someone
I want you to meet.

19:57.846 --> 19:58.845
Rupert!

19:58.923 --> 20:00.423
I stitched him back together.

20:00.441 --> 20:02.516
He's pretty much himself
except for one small thing.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.110
He lost his short-term memory
and has no recollection

20:05.263 --> 20:07.413
of the difficulties
of the summer.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.376
Thanks, Brian.

20:12.603 --> 20:13.878
And if I'm honest,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.272
I was to blame
for said difficulties.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.549
Oh, buddy, I never cared.

20:18.701 --> 20:21.385
Now let's get you out of here
before someone recognizes you.

20:23.297 --> 20:26.432
Next time let's just bring
a hat and glasses.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.473
I'm glad we worked
everything out, Dad.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.901
What do you say we try
to have that catch again?

20:37.052 --> 20:38.903
I would love to, Chris.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.239
(panting)

20:43.392 --> 20:46.135
Better call
in Boston Dynamics Dad again.

20:46.228 --> 20:47.970
He's upstairs with Mom.

20:47.989 --> 20:50.639
He's upstairs with her a lot.

20:50.658 --> 20:53.309
I guess that's the future.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.311
(laughs)

20:55.329 --> 20:56.979
Can you stop laughing?

20:56.998 --> 20:59.632
A robot is railing my mom.
