WEBVTT

00:10.986 --> 00:13.788
Hey. You've been working up a storm lately.

00:13.823 --> 00:15.990
Well, the gallery has a ton of wall space.

00:16.024 --> 00:19.762
I have my old stuff, but I really want
to show as many new pieces as possible.

00:20.596 --> 00:23.732
- Another portrait?
- Yeah. And my first official sale.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.834
What? How? Who?

00:25.868 --> 00:27.669
A customer from the Cracked Mug.

00:27.703 --> 00:29.471
She commissioned me to paint her.

00:29.505 --> 00:32.406
Sweetie, that is great!
Congratulations! Can I see?

00:32.441 --> 00:34.375
Uh, it's not quite ready yet.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.545
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, no, no. All in good time.

00:37.580 --> 00:42.584
- Okay.
- So, how is the baby shower coming along?

00:42.618 --> 00:46.088
- Do you need any last-minute help?
- No, thanks.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.592
Actually, I do have a
bunch of errands to run.

00:50.626 --> 00:53.528
And I was just gonna drag
Will along with me, but...

00:53.562 --> 00:57.265
I can watch him for you. I want
to get to know him better anyway.

00:57.299 --> 01:00.168
Perfect.

01:04.006 --> 01:07.041
Here's a list of the summer
internships I've applied for so far.

01:09.145 --> 01:12.847
- These are very impressive.
- And competitive.

01:12.882 --> 01:15.850
Which is why I thought if
you had any connections,

01:15.885 --> 01:18.119
maybe you wouldn't mind
putting a good word in?

01:21.223 --> 01:25.126
- I'm afraid I can't help.
- Oh.

01:25.161 --> 01:28.830
Okay. Can I ask why?

01:28.864 --> 01:32.234
Daphne, I don't think that
medicine is the right path for you.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.639
You don't think I should be a doctor?

01:37.673 --> 01:41.709
Taking chemistry a second
time, that took real chutzpah.

01:41.744 --> 01:45.480
But the fact remains
that your combined grade

01:45.514 --> 01:47.882
for the two semesters is still only a C.

01:47.992 --> 01:51.961
- But that's only one grade.
- But in a core pre-med class.

01:51.996 --> 01:55.598
Over time, your workload
is only gonna get harder.

01:55.633 --> 01:58.635
If you're struggling now,
it's highly improbable

01:58.669 --> 02:00.637
that you're gonna make
it to the finish line.

02:00.671 --> 02:04.540
I realize that this...

02:04.575 --> 02:06.409
... A plethora of other career paths...

02:06.443 --> 02:09.312
Thank you for your time. I should go.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.423 --> 02:23.159
Um, am I supposed to squeeze
a vegetable into this meal?

02:23.193 --> 02:26.296
Mustard is a seed, which
technically is grown in a garden.

02:26.330 --> 02:27.530
Yeah, that's a bit of a stretch.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.133
But, hey, I won't tell your
dad or Regina if you don't.

02:30.167 --> 02:35.171
- Deal.
- Okay... and...

02:35.205 --> 02:37.473
Just keep the change.

02:37.508 --> 02:39.409
All right. Uh...

02:39.443 --> 02:43.413
The shower's in an hour, which
pretty much means we gotta eat and...

02:43.447 --> 02:45.982
Will?

02:46.984 --> 02:48.284
Will?

02:50.287 --> 02:52.956
Will! W...

02:54.959 --> 02:56.192
Will!

03:00.164 --> 03:03.900
What are you doing? Hey! Stop!

03:04.935 --> 03:07.103
What are you doing? Hey!

03:07.137 --> 03:09.973
No! No, no, no, no! Stop! Hey!

03:12.042 --> 03:13.810
Okay. K4X...

03:16.213 --> 03:18.881
K4X...

03:18.916 --> 03:20.049
K4X... um...

03:27.191 --> 03:28.758
Hey, Bay. How's it going?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.093
Regina, someone just took Will!

03:30.127 --> 03:31.094
What?

03:40.838 --> 03:43.106
Damn it. She's his mother.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.141
His mother? I thought she was dead.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.208
We went through a nasty divorce.

03:47.242 --> 03:48.910
And she's still fighting me over custody.

03:48.944 --> 03:52.280
Oh, god, she totally used me.

03:52.314 --> 03:54.115
This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

03:54.149 --> 03:55.950
Sweetie, it's not your fault.

03:55.984 --> 03:58.286
- If anyone is to blame, it's...
- Me.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.055
I always knew this could happen someday.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.758
We need to find Will and bring him
home. I need you to tell me everything.

04:03.792 --> 04:06.127
Okay. Well, um...

04:06.161 --> 04:09.764
There's not much to tell. She came
here to the Cracked Mug a few days ago,

04:09.798 --> 04:13.134
she liked my portraits. Then
she offered me $500 to paint her.

04:13.168 --> 04:15.870
- The next day, we met back at my studio...
- She's been to the house?

04:15.904 --> 04:20.041
- Yeah. Is that bad?
- No, it's fine. Go on.

04:20.075 --> 04:24.112
She just asked a bunch of questions about
the coffeehouse, the other portraits.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.848
I just thought she was being friendly.

04:26.882 --> 04:29.250
Did she give you a cell number,
mention where she was staying?

04:29.284 --> 04:32.053
- All of our interaction was in person.
- Damn it.

04:32.087 --> 04:34.021
Oh, I got part of her license plate.

04:34.056 --> 04:37.125
Uh, Kansas K4X. The car was dark blue.

04:37.159 --> 04:39.026
Kansas plates. Means
it's probably a rental.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.928
I'll call around, see
if I can find a match.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.502
Okay. Eric has custody and Hope's upset?

04:48.137 --> 04:50.204
- I still don't really get it.
- It's complicated.

04:50.239 --> 04:53.241
I just hope Will's okay.

04:53.275 --> 04:56.811
I'm sure he is. She's his mom.
She doesn't want to hurt him.

04:56.845 --> 04:59.147
- You're sure we shouldn't call the police?
- Yes.

04:59.181 --> 05:02.917
This is a private family matter.

05:02.951 --> 05:05.953
Oh, my god. Lily's shower.

05:05.988 --> 05:08.122
Oh. Hey, I'll cover for you.

05:08.157 --> 05:09.991
You just stay here, focus
on getting Will back.

05:10.025 --> 05:12.860
I will get there as soon as I can.

05:12.895 --> 05:16.097
- Let's keep this between us, okay?
- Okay.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.903
Just meeting all your mom's friends,

05:21.937 --> 05:23.871
I just want to make sure I
make a really good impression.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.806
You will.

05:25.841 --> 05:26.974
Come on, you're carrying a Kennish kid!

05:28.911 --> 05:30.978
Our baby shower. Who'd of thought it?

05:32.314 --> 05:34.982
If only I didn't have to tell
Melody that I was quitting my job.

05:35.017 --> 05:37.785
Mm. I hear ya. I still haven't told Bay.

05:37.819 --> 05:39.987
- I've been avoiding it.
- How did Daphne take it?

05:40.022 --> 05:43.124
She was bummed, but I think
knowing a trip to London

05:43.158 --> 05:45.993
is in her future helped ease the pain.

05:46.028 --> 05:48.930
Flats it is.

05:48.964 --> 05:52.099
- Hey, come here. Oh!
- Oh!

05:52.134 --> 05:54.035
Today is not the day to be worried

05:54.069 --> 05:57.138
about hard conversations
or shoes that don't fit.

05:57.172 --> 06:00.141
- Just try to enjoy it.
- You're right.

06:00.175 --> 06:01.909
I can talk to Melody on Monday.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.879
Today is about celebrating our son.

06:04.913 --> 06:08.216
- And presents!
- Yeah.

06:10.852 --> 06:13.888
Ah! Ladies, correct me if I'm wrong,

06:13.922 --> 06:15.990
but isn't Regina supposed
to be hosting all this?

06:16.094 --> 06:19.096
It's okay. We're happy to help.

06:19.131 --> 06:21.232
I'm gonna take these
out to the foyer. Here.

06:21.266 --> 06:25.036
It looks great out there, sweetie.

06:25.070 --> 06:28.241
So, how's the internship hunt
going? Anything promising?

06:30.876 --> 06:36.080
Actually, I've been
re-thinking my summer plans.

06:36.114 --> 06:38.015
I mean, do I really want to work for free?

06:38.050 --> 06:41.152
Oh, no. I don't want our money problems

06:41.186 --> 06:44.722
- to have an influence on you, okay?
- No, it's not that.

06:45.257 --> 06:48.527
I just think I'd rather do
something more practical.

06:50.062 --> 06:53.998
You know, get a real job.

06:54.032 --> 06:56.934
Wait a second. Wasn't this
whole summer internship

06:56.968 --> 07:00.472
about the long haul, okay,
investing in your future as a doctor?

07:03.842 --> 07:05.976
- What?
- Uh, caterer's here.

07:06.011 --> 07:07.078
Oh. I'll go get it.

07:13.118 --> 07:16.153
- Need any help?
- Hey, D.

07:16.188 --> 07:19.190
Sharee! Oh, my god!

07:19.224 --> 07:22.159
- It's so good to see you!
- You too.

07:22.194 --> 07:23.961
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

07:23.995 --> 07:25.129
I didn't even know we were coming here

07:25.163 --> 07:26.163
until we turned down the street.

07:26.198 --> 07:29.100
Damn, S.L.U. lets out early!

07:29.134 --> 07:31.168
- How long have you been home?
- Not long.

07:31.203 --> 07:34.105
And you already have a
summer job? Good for you.

07:34.139 --> 07:36.941
Money's not bad and the
people are nice, so...

07:36.975 --> 07:39.009
So tell me everything.
How was field hockey?

07:39.044 --> 07:42.079
I heard that you guys kicked Indiana's ass.

07:42.114 --> 07:44.949
- Yeah, it was a big win for us.
- Were you a starter?

07:44.983 --> 07:48.185
Actually, I, um... I had to quit the team.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.121
What? Why?

07:50.155 --> 07:53.124
Hurt my shoulder. Took
me out for the season.

07:53.158 --> 07:55.159
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

07:55.193 --> 07:57.962
- What about your scholarship?
- We worked something out.

07:57.996 --> 08:00.331
- That's a relief.
- Yeah. I better...

08:07.072 --> 08:09.173
- Mom! We're here!
- Oh, hey!

08:09.207 --> 08:11.842
Hey, we're not too early, are we? Sorry.

08:11.877 --> 08:14.044
Oh, god, you look so beautiful!

08:14.079 --> 08:17.181
- Oh, wow, place looks great.
- Thank you.

08:17.215 --> 08:19.984
But we're not finished in the
living room, so no peeking.

08:20.018 --> 08:23.789
- Oh, hopefully the loo's not off limits?
- Of course not. Go ahead.

08:25.023 --> 08:27.124
I heard there was a plumbing
emergency at the Cracked Mug.

08:28.827 --> 08:30.728
Yes. Uh... yeah.

08:30.762 --> 08:33.998
- It was this pipe that burst.
- Oh, no.

08:34.032 --> 08:35.866
Yeah, so she is with the plumber right now.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.934
In the meantime, I will be your substitute

08:37.969 --> 08:39.937
- hostess with the mostest.
- Oh, honey,

08:39.971 --> 08:42.606
you've been so busy with
the art show and everything.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.576
- I can help.
- Absolutely not, mom.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.711
This shower is in your honor too. Okay?

08:47.746 --> 08:50.714
So just sit back and relax.

08:50.749 --> 08:54.718
All right. Well, I haven't had a
chance to celebrate with my friends.

08:54.753 --> 08:58.823
- It's gonna be a nice day.
- Toby, you ready to conquer 18 holes?

08:58.857 --> 09:01.525
Ladies, have fun. See you later.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.661
- Wish me luck.
- Bye.

09:03.695 --> 09:07.531
Okay. So I just have to set up
the easel with all the baby photos,

09:07.566 --> 09:10.401
and then I'm gonna put out some
pens and paper for motherly advice.

09:10.435 --> 09:12.503
I definitely need to change. Okay...

09:12.537 --> 09:16.074
- Are you sure that I...
- No. Mom, totally got this.

09:19.444 --> 09:22.480
- All right. Thanks.
- Anything?

09:23.748 --> 09:26.484
Well, on the plus side, Hope
hasn't involved the police.

09:26.518 --> 09:28.619
I'm not so sure that's a plus.

09:28.653 --> 09:30.287
Look, she's definitely working an angle.

09:30.322 --> 09:31.422
If all she wanted was Will back,

09:31.456 --> 09:33.257
she would've called the
cops on me and been halfway

09:33.291 --> 09:36.494
back to Atlanta by now.

09:39.498 --> 09:41.298
Cracked Mug.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.567
Where's my son? Is he okay?

09:43.602 --> 09:45.469
Let me speak to him.

09:45.504 --> 09:48.239
Just let me speak to him!

09:48.273 --> 09:52.109
Yeah. Yeah. I'm listening.

09:53.311 --> 09:55.346
No. This is between you and me. No!

09:57.449 --> 09:59.483
- She wants to meet with you.
- Me?

09:59.518 --> 10:03.153
Frazier Park, one hour. If she
sees me, she'll call the cops.

10:03.188 --> 10:04.388
Of course.

10:04.422 --> 10:07.157
Tell her yes. I'll go.

10:10.195 --> 10:11.962
She'll be there.

10:14.165 --> 10:16.867
- Why me?
- I have no idea.

10:16.902 --> 10:19.970
- But you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

10:20.005 --> 10:22.039
I'm in this with you.

10:40.337 --> 10:43.039
Hey, where should I put these?

10:43.074 --> 10:45.241
Uh... in here.

10:48.879 --> 10:50.880
Okay. So, you're not gonna believe this.

10:50.915 --> 10:53.750
But Will's mom is actually alive.

10:54.952 --> 10:57.721
Yeah, I know that.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.689
W...  You know?

11:00.925 --> 11:04.594
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It wasn't my secret to tell.

11:04.628 --> 11:07.997
It's Regina's. Well, Eric's, technically.

11:08.032 --> 11:10.700
And none of you thought that I should know.

11:10.735 --> 11:11.968
It wasn't like that.

11:12.092 --> 11:14.761
Look, when Regina found
out, she confronted Eric

11:14.795 --> 11:16.663
and he told her the whole story.

11:16.697 --> 11:19.632
But she wanted to make
sure that it was all true.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.770
So we actually went to
Atlanta to check her out.

11:23.904 --> 11:25.872
You did what?

11:25.906 --> 11:29.008
That weekend we went to
Ohio to visit our cousins?

11:29.043 --> 11:34.547
You were actually in Atlanta?
You lied to me? Both of you?

11:34.582 --> 11:38.618
- I'm sorry. I just didn't...
- Hello?

11:39.687 --> 11:42.422
- What is she doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey!

11:42.456 --> 11:45.692
- We are so not done.
- We'll talk later, okay?

11:45.726 --> 11:46.759
Professor Marillo.

11:50.664 --> 11:53.466
- Daphne?
- Hi. What are you doing here?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.702
I'm here for the baby shower.

11:55.736 --> 11:58.771
I... no, I mean, how do you know Lily?

11:58.806 --> 12:02.442
We met at a women in academia luncheon.

12:02.476 --> 12:05.678
I'm guessing that you two know each
other through the disabilities office?

12:05.713 --> 12:09.282
Yeah. And the baby's father is my brother.

12:09.316 --> 12:11.651
Ah.

12:11.685 --> 12:14.220
- Small world.
- Yeah.

12:14.255 --> 12:17.290
You know, I'm actually
glad that I ran into you.

12:17.389 --> 12:20.625
I felt bad about how
our conversation ended.

12:20.659 --> 12:23.594
It's okay. We really don't
need to talk about it.

12:23.629 --> 12:27.265
But were upset, which is
completely understandable.

12:27.299 --> 12:30.101
I merely thought that it was better for you

12:30.135 --> 12:33.271
to face reality now, before...

12:33.305 --> 12:35.273
- Honey?
- Kathryn, hi.

12:35.307 --> 12:39.110
Um, this is my chemistry
professor, Beth Marillo.

12:39.144 --> 12:42.547
- This is my biological mom, Kathryn Kennish.
- Oh, welcome! Hi.

12:43.182 --> 12:46.451
So the deafness, not hereditary.

12:47.286 --> 12:50.121
- Uh, no.
- Do you know what caused it?

12:50.155 --> 12:53.257
Um, Daphne had meningitis
when she was three.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.962
Uh, come on in. Do you
want something to drink?

12:57.997 --> 13:00.098
- Here.
- Yes, thank you.

13:10.109 --> 13:13.778
- Eric's not here.
- He better not be.

13:13.812 --> 13:15.813
How's Will? Is he okay?

13:15.848 --> 13:17.215
You mean Keon? He's fine.

13:17.249 --> 13:19.717
He's eating pizza watching a show.

13:19.752 --> 13:21.919
- "Sky something."
- Skywatchers .

13:21.954 --> 13:25.923
Just because you know what show he
watches doesn't make you his mama.

13:25.958 --> 13:28.926
- I'm his mama.
- What do you want?

13:28.961 --> 13:32.631
You've got your kid, you haven't
called the cops. Why am I here?

13:33.866 --> 13:37.635
I want me and Keon to start a
new life. And that takes money.

13:37.669 --> 13:40.571
What, you and Jared don't
make enough selling drugs?

13:40.606 --> 13:42.640
I said a new life.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.776
Jared is in the past.

13:44.810 --> 13:47.612
I turned state's evidence
on him. He's in prison.

13:49.915 --> 13:53.551
That's the prosecutor,
if you don't believe me.

13:53.585 --> 13:55.820
I'm outta the drug game for good.

13:55.854 --> 13:57.822
No, now you're just into
blackmail and extortion.

13:57.856 --> 14:01.459
I'm offering you a chance
to keep your criminal man

14:01.493 --> 14:03.728
from doing time for kidnapping my son.

14:03.762 --> 14:06.765
Don't act like Eric is the angel here.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.369
I've made some mistakes, I know that.

14:11.403 --> 14:14.705
But I'm clean now. I'm
ready to start fresh,

14:14.740 --> 14:17.642
ready to be a good mom to
Keon. I know I can do it.

14:17.676 --> 14:21.512
I just need a hundred
grand, so we can start fresh.

14:21.547 --> 14:23.281
You want $100,000?

14:23.315 --> 14:26.451
And in return, I won't
call the cops on Eric, ever.

14:26.485 --> 14:29.353
- We don't have that kind of money.
- I seen where y'all live.

14:29.388 --> 14:30.588
A hundred grand, you can afford that.

14:30.622 --> 14:33.458
My living situation is
not what you think it is.

14:33.492 --> 14:35.460
I know rich when I see it.

14:38.197 --> 14:39.597
Okay, so let's say we get
you the money. And then what?

14:39.631 --> 14:41.332
How do we know you're
not gonna call the cops?

14:43.202 --> 14:45.470
- You'll have to trust me.
- Yeah, right.

14:45.504 --> 14:48.506
I could say the same about you.

14:48.540 --> 14:52.176
You pretended you were moving to
Atlanta just to get a look at me.

14:52.211 --> 14:55.847
And what did you do,
break a hose on a rental?

14:56.281 --> 15:00.352
You're in love with him. I can see it.

15:00.986 --> 15:04.889
Hey, it's okay. I've been there, I know.

15:04.923 --> 15:07.125
That man gets a hold of your heart...

15:10.162 --> 15:13.297
That's why you came to Atlanta,

15:13.332 --> 15:16.801
and that's why you are gonna pay me.

15:17.903 --> 15:21.205
You got 24 hours to get
me and Keon that money,

15:21.240 --> 15:23.007
or I turn Eric in.

15:39.758 --> 15:41.826
Hey. Okay, so we are asking...

15:41.860 --> 15:44.729
Aren't you radiant? Just a vision.

15:44.763 --> 15:47.732
- Oh. Thank you.
- I'm Margaret Halpern.

15:47.766 --> 15:51.670
- Kathryn and I are in the choir together at St. Mark's.
- Oh, Lily. Pleasure to meet you.

15:52.604 --> 15:55.907
- I just want to say, you must be so special.
- Excuse me?

15:56.642 --> 15:59.744
Well, god gives special
children to special people.

15:59.778 --> 16:01.846
Those kids are little angels.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.788
Hey, hey! Hey, careful.

16:10.822 --> 16:12.557
Does your boss know about your shoulder?

16:12.591 --> 16:14.559
You know, it's really not that bad.

16:14.593 --> 16:16.761
If it was bad enough that
you had to quit the team...

16:19.631 --> 16:20.731
Or maybe it wasn't.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.735
Hey. Why did you really quit the team?

16:24.770 --> 16:27.738
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

16:27.773 --> 16:30.775
- Was it your coach? A teammate?
- No.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.411
Whatever it is, maybe I can help.

16:33.445 --> 16:35.379
I can get Toby to call the coach,

16:35.414 --> 16:37.448
- and see about getting you reinstated.
- No!

16:40.519 --> 16:43.554
I don't understand.

16:43.589 --> 16:46.224
I don't go to that school anymore.

16:46.258 --> 16:48.359
What are you talking about? What
do you mean you don't go there?

16:48.393 --> 16:50.494
I dropped out, all right?

17:06.428 --> 17:08.628
Oh... sorry. I just needed a little rest.

17:08.663 --> 17:11.397
It's okay. Just relax.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.435
So, I saw you talking to Mrs. Halpern.

17:15.470 --> 17:18.439
Yeah. That lady's a piece of work.

17:18.473 --> 17:22.142
I know they mean well, but it's
just the way they're looking at me...

17:22.176 --> 17:24.444
Like they feel so sorry for me.

17:24.479 --> 17:28.315
- Sometimes it's exhausting.
- Yeah, I've, uh...

17:28.349 --> 17:30.117
I've been there.

17:30.151 --> 17:32.989
It happens to me every
time I walk across campus.

17:35.323 --> 17:37.424
You know, we've never really
had a chance to talk about that.

17:37.459 --> 17:40.194
Um... how I was the one who...

17:40.228 --> 17:42.229
Reported what happened with me and Tank?

17:44.266 --> 17:46.166
I'm sorry how that played out.

17:46.201 --> 17:48.335
You have to know, I was just doing my job.

17:48.370 --> 17:50.871
I do know that.

17:50.906 --> 17:53.107
And I'm glad somebody was there to do it.

17:54.142 --> 17:56.076
- Oh!
- Uh...

17:56.111 --> 17:58.247
- Is that him?
- Yeah. I think he wants to say hi.

18:00.282 --> 18:03.050
Really? Uh...

18:03.084 --> 18:06.186
- May I?
- Go ahead.

18:09.758 --> 18:12.760
Oh... oh!

18:12.794 --> 18:14.061
Hey there, little guy.

18:14.095 --> 18:15.996
Oh... oh! I'm sorry. Is this weird?

18:16.031 --> 18:19.066
Not at all. They say
it's good to talk to him.

18:21.903 --> 18:25.306
Buddy... , it's your Aunt Bay.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.676
Oh, have I got such plans for you.

18:28.710 --> 18:29.977
I'm going to teach you how to finger paint,

18:30.011 --> 18:33.547
and I'm gonna show you
all the good places to hide

18:33.582 --> 18:35.849
from Grandpa and Grandma.

18:35.884 --> 18:38.652
We're gonna have so much fun.

18:44.826 --> 18:46.794
Lily, listen, um...

18:46.828 --> 18:50.598
I know my mom's friends can be a lot.

18:50.632 --> 18:53.667
So... just stick with me.

18:54.803 --> 18:58.440
- I'll have your back.
- Thanks.

19:03.378 --> 19:07.048
- When did you drop out?
- Christmas.

19:07.082 --> 19:10.017
- Christmas?
- It wasn't for me, okay?

19:10.052 --> 19:11.285
What are you talking about?

19:11.320 --> 19:14.322
You were one of the smartest
kids in our English class.

19:14.356 --> 19:16.357
You have no problem speaking up.

19:16.391 --> 19:20.361
Most classes, I was the
only black face in the room.

19:20.395 --> 19:24.231
Everyone was talking about what island
they were going to for spring break,

19:24.266 --> 19:26.505
and I was praying they'd
keep the dorm dining room open

19:26.506 --> 19:27.806
so I'd have somewhere to eat meals.

19:28.870 --> 19:32.139
Everyone was looking at me
like the poor scholarship kid.

19:32.174 --> 19:35.142
I was just lost, and I
started to fall behind.

19:35.177 --> 19:37.144
The more I fell behind,
the more it freaked me out

19:37.179 --> 19:40.147
'cause then I was the poor black girl
on scholarship who couldn't keep up.

19:40.182 --> 19:43.851
- Why didn't you ask for help?
- Ask who?

19:43.885 --> 19:47.188
Anyone. The dean, your professor,
someone from your family.

19:47.923 --> 19:50.124
Nobody in my family went to college!

19:50.158 --> 19:52.059
My mom didn't understand
what I was going through,

19:52.094 --> 19:54.662
my aunt or my cousin, nobody.

19:54.696 --> 19:58.032
I used to walk around that fancy
campus and think, what am I doing here?

19:58.066 --> 20:00.034
My mom works at a box store.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.837
Who cares what your mom does for a living?

20:02.871 --> 20:06.607
You did deserve to be there. You do.

20:06.641 --> 20:09.510
- You let all that get in your head.
- How could I not?

20:12.914 --> 20:15.851
Look, me and college are a bad match.

20:18.620 --> 20:21.756
And I've made my peace with it.

20:21.790 --> 20:23.824
I better get these out there.

20:31.610 --> 20:35.213
Even if this checks out, I still don't
trust her. She's a liar and an addict.

20:35.247 --> 20:36.314
- Eric...
- We give her the money,

20:36.348 --> 20:38.149
what's to say that she
still won't call the cops?

20:38.183 --> 20:40.351
Nothing. But if we
don't give her the money,

20:40.385 --> 20:43.554
- you know she will.
- Great. So I not only lose my son,

20:43.589 --> 20:46.357
I get to spend the rest of my life
wondering if she's gonna change her mind?

20:46.391 --> 20:50.161
Yes, if you want to have any
chance at staying out of prison.

20:50.195 --> 20:52.396
Fine. I'll give her the money.

20:52.431 --> 20:54.465
But only because it'll buy me
some time to get my son back.

20:54.499 --> 20:56.334
Okay, then.

20:56.368 --> 20:58.269
I still have some of the
money that Angelo left me.

20:58.303 --> 21:01.005
- It's not quite a hundred grand...
- No, no, no. I'm not taking your money.

21:01.039 --> 21:04.175
- This is my problem.
- This is our problem.

21:04.209 --> 21:07.144
I told you, I'm in this with you.

21:07.179 --> 21:10.915
Will is like a son to me, and I love you.

21:10.949 --> 21:13.918
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you out of jail.

21:13.952 --> 21:15.853
Please, take the money.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.028
I'll pay you back.

21:25.931 --> 21:28.099
I'm not worried about that.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.867
I'm worried about coming up with the rest.

21:31.903 --> 21:34.739
- I know some people.
- What kind of "people"?

21:34.773 --> 21:37.008
Someone who owes me a favor.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.810
- I'll make some calls, track him down.
- Eric!

21:39.845 --> 21:43.748
We'll talk about it later. You should
get to the shower, make an appearance.

21:47.052 --> 21:48.953
Text me if you hear anything.

21:59.731 --> 22:01.799
Oh!

22:32.664 --> 22:34.665
I'm moving to London with Toby.

22:40.305 --> 22:41.272
I'm quitting.

22:42.507 --> 22:45.276
I've been wrestling with this for weeks.

22:45.310 --> 22:47.545
I love the deaf program,

22:47.579 --> 22:51.150
and working with you, it's my dream job.

22:52.484 --> 22:56.320
But at the end of the day, I have
to do what's best for the baby,

22:56.355 --> 22:59.423
and that means moving to England.

22:59.458 --> 23:03.261
I'm sorry. I hope you don't hate me.

23:22.047 --> 23:23.013
Thank you.

23:29.187 --> 23:32.457
- You're moving to London?
- Yeah.

23:32.891 --> 23:35.926
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Toby wanted to,

23:35.961 --> 23:37.094
he just couldn't find the right moment.

23:37.129 --> 23:38.896
Cake is served.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.995
- Enjoy.
- Outside. Now.

23:53.615 --> 23:56.350
Did you know that Toby and
Lily are moving to London?

23:59.254 --> 24:00.488
Oh, my god.

24:00.522 --> 24:04.325
Am I the last person in this
family to know everything?

24:04.359 --> 24:07.428
I only found out two days ago.
Toby asked me not to say anything

24:07.463 --> 24:09.097
'cause he wanted to tell you himself.

24:09.131 --> 24:10.498
Yeah, well, looks like he missed the boat.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.367
I'm sorry. Go ahead, ask me anything.

24:13.402 --> 24:14.435
I'll tell you whatever I know.

24:14.470 --> 24:18.139
Okay.

24:18.173 --> 24:20.241
Eric. Do you trust him?

24:20.275 --> 24:22.043
Eric is a good guy.

24:22.077 --> 24:25.146
He only took Will because he was
in a really dangerous situation.

24:25.180 --> 24:28.617
I'm sorry. Um, he... he
took Will? Like illegally?

24:29.251 --> 24:32.220
Hope was a drug addict. Eric
had to get him out of there.

24:32.254 --> 24:36.224
- So Eric is the kidnapper?
- Technically, yeah, I guess.

24:36.258 --> 24:38.259
I know this looks bad.

24:38.293 --> 24:41.863
And... he used to be in a gang.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.266
Wow. This guy is turning
out to be a real prince.

24:45.300 --> 24:49.103
No, it was a long time ago,
and I got over it when he...

24:49.138 --> 24:51.839
When he what?

24:51.874 --> 24:54.142
Okay, now I know you're going to be mad.

24:54.176 --> 24:55.843
I'm already mad.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.014
Nacho tried to blackmail me.

25:00.048 --> 25:02.016
Nacho tried to blackmail you?

25:02.050 --> 25:05.887
It was months ago, and
Eric totally shut it down.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.790
- It was amazing.
- And you didn't think that I should know about this?

25:09.825 --> 25:11.559
It was the night of the storm.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.761
Emmett was in town after
the whole Tank thing,

25:13.795 --> 25:16.697
Grandma Bonnie was here,
Kathryn was really upset.

25:16.732 --> 25:20.668
- Everyone had a lot going on.
- Daphne, Nacho affects me too!

25:20.702 --> 25:24.406
- I had a right to know!
- You're right. I'm sorry.

25:30.746 --> 25:34.715
Absolutely. Let's go open some presents.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.817
Bay...

25:39.488 --> 25:42.423
I just hate that Bay found out that way.

25:42.457 --> 25:46.394
She'll be happy for you
eventually. Just give her time.

25:46.428 --> 25:48.396
You think Melody will feel the same way?

25:48.430 --> 25:52.333
Are you having second
thoughts about leaving?

25:52.367 --> 25:56.237
Not about moving, I just hate
leaving Melody short-handed.

25:56.271 --> 26:00.208
- People quit their jobs. It happens.
- Except I love my job.

26:00.242 --> 26:03.144
And I'm leaving just as the
program is getting started.

26:03.178 --> 26:05.379
I've worked really hard to get where I am.

26:05.414 --> 26:08.182
Helping to build something
from the ground up.

26:08.217 --> 26:11.519
I may never get an
opportunity like this again.

26:11.553 --> 26:13.454
I'm just not ready to
close the door on my career.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.123
It doesn't have to be closed
forever. You could always...

26:16.158 --> 26:18.259
Lily, Kathryn, I am so sorry.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.127
Oh, no, it's fine! We just missed you.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.231
- How's the leaky pipe?
- It's holding.

26:24.299 --> 26:25.433
- Oh.
- Um...

26:27.469 --> 26:30.404
Thank you for covering for me. I owe you.

26:30.439 --> 26:33.307
- How's Will?
- Hope called. Will is safe.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.076
And Eric is working on a solution.

26:35.110 --> 26:36.944
I think everything's gonna work out.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.919
Aww!

26:47.189 --> 26:50.925
It's so sweet of Grandma
to send something. Love it!

26:50.959 --> 26:54.729
- I love it.
- Okay. Well, let's do the next one.

26:54.763 --> 26:56.897
Thank you. Ooh, heavy.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.969
- Oh, wow. So elaborate.
- Oh!

27:02.004 --> 27:05.673
It's a train set! Who's it from?

27:05.707 --> 27:07.775
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

27:07.809 --> 27:10.678
I only learned today that
the boy has Down syndrome.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.713
Oh, it's okay. It's a great gift.

27:12.748 --> 27:14.949
- Yeah.
- Obviously, if I had known...

27:14.983 --> 27:17.685
Oh, no, no. He's gonna love it!

27:17.719 --> 27:19.954
It just might take him a
little longer to master.

27:19.988 --> 27:22.880
I know this one child at the park,

27:22.881 --> 27:24.750
you can hardly even tell.

27:25.527 --> 27:27.561
You might have one
that's barely noticeable.

27:29.631 --> 27:34.669
- So, let's open another gift.
- Yeah. That's a great idea. Okay.

27:34.703 --> 27:37.571
- So...
- These children are the sweetest thing.

27:37.606 --> 27:39.607
Always hugging you, so affectionate.

27:39.641 --> 27:42.510
Yes, why is that, I wonder?

27:42.544 --> 27:44.478
You know, that's a fascinating question.

27:44.513 --> 27:48.082
I don't know that all Down
syndrome children are any one thing.

27:48.650 --> 27:52.720
Yes, but affection is clearly a
marked trait in DS individuals.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.623
You know, one thing I do
know is that they're doing

27:55.657 --> 27:58.392
amazing things these days
with chromosome therapy.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.495
Basically, they shut down defective genes

28:01.530 --> 28:04.298
by silencing them, turn them off.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.500
I wouldn't be surprised
if 50 years from now,

28:06.535 --> 28:10.304
they fix Down syndrome
altogether. Eradicated it.

28:10.339 --> 28:11.672
That's amazing.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.343
Who said they need to be fixed?

28:16.601 --> 28:20.038
Oh. Well... that was a bad word choice.

28:20.672 --> 28:22.706
Who said the gene is defective?

28:22.741 --> 28:27.578
Again, bad choice of words.

28:27.612 --> 28:30.448
I should've said "abnormal."

28:31.616 --> 28:35.319
Not... the norm.

28:35.353 --> 28:37.621
What's wrong with being abnormal?

28:37.656 --> 28:41.258
Maybe it's good that they
see the world differently.

28:41.293 --> 28:45.463
Maybe we don't always have to
value faster, stronger, smarter.

28:46.298 --> 28:49.233
Kathryn, it's okay. You
don't have to defend...

28:49.267 --> 28:51.435
No, no, no. Isn't it
possible that there's a reason

28:51.470 --> 28:54.305
that not everyone on
the planet is the same?

28:54.339 --> 28:57.242
Yes. But shortened life span,

28:58.376 --> 29:00.678
health problems, decreased mental ability?

29:00.802 --> 29:04.738
Of course we, as a race, want to cure that.

29:04.773 --> 29:08.710
The fact that your family is
handling this so well is fantastic,

29:09.644 --> 29:13.380
but trisomy 21 is a genetic mutation

29:13.415 --> 29:17.152
that evolution or science
will get rid of someday.

29:18.286 --> 29:20.287
We don't know that.

29:20.322 --> 29:24.025
What I do know is that this is a
celebration of Lily and my grandson,

29:24.659 --> 29:28.429
and I would like to keep it that way.

29:35.637 --> 29:39.340
Bay, should we open another gift?

29:39.374 --> 29:42.409
Yes, we can.

29:53.807 --> 29:56.442
Professor, wait.

29:57.845 --> 30:00.415
Well, now I've battled with both your moms.

30:02.449 --> 30:04.484
Why did you let me into your class?

30:05.686 --> 30:07.654
You impressed me.

30:07.688 --> 30:10.623
I was giving you a chance to
prove that you were exceptional.

30:10.658 --> 30:11.791
But you don't think that I am?

30:14.561 --> 30:15.695
Because I'm "abnormal"?

30:17.865 --> 30:21.501
I think your deafness

30:21.535 --> 30:25.605
is a bigger obstacle to mastering
science than anticipated.

30:25.709 --> 30:29.746
But there's no question

30:30.481 --> 30:32.482
that you have a bright future,

30:32.516 --> 30:35.385
and there are so many other ways that
you can make a difference in the world.

30:35.419 --> 30:38.388
There is public policy, or social work...

30:38.422 --> 30:41.824
you once told me not to give up so
easily when someone knocks me down.

30:41.859 --> 30:45.428
That was really good advice.

30:45.462 --> 30:48.564
I am going to be a doctor.

30:48.599 --> 30:51.334
It might not be at the best
medical school in the nation.

30:51.368 --> 30:54.404
And it might take me longer than
other people. But I will get there.

30:54.438 --> 30:57.140
I am going to do it.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.772
Okay. So...

31:06.807 --> 31:09.375
Lily will pick a card.

31:09.409 --> 31:12.645
And then whoever wrote
it can read it out loud

31:12.679 --> 31:15.748
- to the rest of the group.
- Bay, if you don't mind?

31:19.520 --> 31:21.320
Hi, everyone.

31:21.355 --> 31:23.422
I'm so sorry for being late.

31:23.490 --> 31:27.460
I just wanted to thank you
all for coming out today

31:27.494 --> 31:30.463
to support Lily and Toby.

31:30.497 --> 31:33.299
And a special thank you to Bay

31:33.333 --> 31:35.468
for pinch-hitting as hostess.

31:38.238 --> 31:40.673
I didn't have time to write out my advice,

31:40.707 --> 31:43.211
so I'll just share it quickly. Um...

31:46.313 --> 31:48.247
Lily...

31:48.352 --> 31:50.653
Trust your gut, always.

31:50.687 --> 31:54.257
Mother's intuition is real.

31:54.291 --> 31:55.625
Listen to it.

31:55.659 --> 31:58.628
If something doesn't feel right to you,

31:58.662 --> 32:02.164
it probably isn't.

32:02.199 --> 32:04.600
When Daphne was three,

32:04.635 --> 32:08.604
she got very sick, very fast.

32:08.639 --> 32:11.574
102 fever, vomiting.

32:11.608 --> 32:13.576
So I rushed her to the E.R.,

32:13.610 --> 32:17.413
and the doctor told me that
she had the stomach flu.

32:17.447 --> 32:21.083
I should take her home and give
her fluids, and wait it out.

32:21.118 --> 32:24.453
But as we towards the car,

32:24.488 --> 32:28.524
I could tell that something
bigger was taking hold.

32:28.558 --> 32:31.427
I had no idea what it was,

32:31.461 --> 32:34.297
but I knew something wasn't right.

32:34.331 --> 32:38.468
So I drove across town to another hospital,

32:39.303 --> 32:42.505
and that's where they
diagnosed her with meningitis.

32:46.109 --> 32:47.143
If I hadn't...

32:54.951 --> 32:57.353
When all is said and done,

32:57.387 --> 32:59.922
you know your kid

32:59.956 --> 33:02.925
better than any doctor,

33:02.959 --> 33:04.927
any teacher...

33:07.064 --> 33:09.298
Or expert.

33:11.134 --> 33:12.868
You are so brave.

33:14.271 --> 33:18.040
Incredible story.

33:23.046 --> 33:25.147
That's it.

33:28.185 --> 33:29.985
Okay, I'll go next. Um...

33:30.020 --> 33:33.255
Well, I'm not a mom,

33:33.290 --> 33:35.191
but I happen to have two.

33:36.993 --> 33:40.229
Uh, so I think that I know a little bit

33:40.263 --> 33:43.899
about the, uh, mother-child relationship.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.202
And for me,

33:46.236 --> 33:50.040
the most important thing a mother can do

33:51.074 --> 33:54.677
is be honest with her children.

33:54.711 --> 33:56.112
Because in the end,

33:56.146 --> 33:59.249
kids will always figure out the truth.

34:08.824 --> 34:10.726
Um...

34:30.981 --> 34:33.681
I spoke to Daphne.

34:33.717 --> 34:36.018
What else is new?

34:36.052 --> 34:37.820
I'm sorry.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.789
I should've told you about Hope.

34:41.992 --> 34:42.958
And Atlanta.

34:44.694 --> 34:45.995
And Nacho.

34:47.898 --> 34:49.831
Honestly,

34:49.866 --> 34:51.900
after Daphne and I dealt with it all,

34:51.935 --> 34:54.469
I figured no one else needed to know.

34:54.504 --> 34:56.605
So it was okay to just keep lying to me.

34:56.639 --> 34:59.575
- No!
- And not just six months ago.

34:59.609 --> 35:01.510
You lied to me this morning.

35:01.545 --> 35:03.712
You told me it was a custody dispute,

35:03.747 --> 35:05.648
when in reality, Eric kidnapped him.

35:05.682 --> 35:08.584
I was trying to keep you out of it.

35:08.618 --> 35:12.388
- Maybe that was a bad choice.
- I don't even know why I'm surprised.

35:12.422 --> 35:16.159
After all, lying's been your M.O.
since you found out about the switch.

35:16.793 --> 35:20.362
Look, I get it. You've
known Daphne a lot longer,

35:20.397 --> 35:23.699
you two have this special
bond. But I'm your daughter too.

35:23.733 --> 35:27.536
So why is it that you tell her
everything, and you tell me nothing?

35:27.571 --> 35:30.573
Bay, it's not like that.
None of this was a choice.

35:30.607 --> 35:32.708
- It just happened.
- That is a cop-out.

35:32.742 --> 35:36.579
You made a choice. You
chose her, like always.

35:36.613 --> 35:38.647
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

35:38.682 --> 35:41.784
Because right now, it feels like
the last four years never happened.

35:57.132 --> 35:59.100
What if you applied to UMKC?

35:59.134 --> 36:01.135
- Daphne...
- You could live at home,

36:01.170 --> 36:02.336
and you already know people there.

36:02.371 --> 36:05.206
- Me, Natalie, Travis, Bay.
- I told you.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.308
College and I aren't a good match.

36:07.342 --> 36:10.980
No, S.L.U. and you weren't a good
match. That's one bad experience.

36:12.214 --> 36:14.081
Not everyone is destined for college.

36:14.116 --> 36:15.283
Fine! But you are.

36:16.919 --> 36:18.252
You can't let this be it, Sharee.

36:18.287 --> 36:20.857
You've got to try again, as scary as it is.

36:22.891 --> 36:26.027
My entire family was watching.

36:26.061 --> 36:29.096
I was gonna be the first.

36:29.131 --> 36:32.133
I know how that feels.
It's a lot of pressure.

36:35.971 --> 36:39.308
Look, I'm not having an easy time either.

36:40.842 --> 36:44.346
And I almost let somebody talk me
into giving up on medical school.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.815
But I'm gonna keep at it.

36:47.849 --> 36:50.818
We can keep each other at it.

36:54.056 --> 36:57.124
Melody's at UMKC.

36:57.159 --> 36:59.561
Your family is close by. You
just need some support, that's it.

37:01.730 --> 37:03.764
Just a little support.

37:06.868 --> 37:07.902
Maybe.

37:09.871 --> 37:12.773
Maybe? Maybe... ?

37:12.808 --> 37:15.076
I said maybe, as in "I'll think about it."

37:16.912 --> 37:20.448
Okay.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.054
Well, we're officially guest-free.

37:27.089 --> 37:29.859
Thank you, Kathryn. For everything.

37:31.893 --> 37:34.829
Hey, I'll defend that little guy

37:34.863 --> 37:37.031
against the world if I have to.

37:37.065 --> 37:39.967
Oh! You know, I have
something I wanna tell you.

37:40.002 --> 37:42.193
- What?
- Well, you know,

37:42.194 --> 37:44.032
when you were talking
about leaving your job,

37:44.039 --> 37:47.775
and how hard it was because
it's such a fantastic program,

37:47.809 --> 37:49.910
I was thinking, that's what I want to do.

37:49.945 --> 37:53.848
I want to be a part of
something that really matters.

37:53.882 --> 37:56.651
So I had a long chat with Melody.

37:56.685 --> 37:58.085
And I told her that I
was looking for a job,

37:58.120 --> 38:00.688
and one thing led to another, and...

38:00.722 --> 38:03.090
You... you're taking my job?

38:03.125 --> 38:05.960
Yeah, just until she
can fill it permanently.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.665
That... that's... wow!

38:10.699 --> 38:14.002
I hope it eases your mind, knowing
you're not leaving Melody in the lurch.

38:15.037 --> 38:17.805
Definitely. That's huge.

38:17.839 --> 38:20.107
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

38:22.167 --> 38:24.168
Is the coast clear?

38:24.202 --> 38:27.037
Very funny.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.839
- Hey!
- Hey, baby.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.110
- Oh!
- So, how'd it do?

38:33.145 --> 38:37.114
- Exhausting, but brilliant.
- See? You survived.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.184
- Looks like you did Bay in.
- Ha.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.953
She was a wonderful hostess.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.823
- So how'd we make out in the loot department?
- Oh, we scored big.

38:45.857 --> 38:49.827
- Yeah.
- It'll probably cost a bundle to ship it all to London.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.229
Oh, yeah. Sorry, babe.
Cat's out of the bag.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.233
I was working up to it.

38:56.268 --> 39:00.171
It's okay. I'm happy for you.

39:01.239 --> 39:02.940
Sweetie, I'm literally falling asleep

39:02.974 --> 39:04.909
- with my eyes open.
- Oh. Let's get you home.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.111
- Bye. You'll can get the stuff tomorrow.
- Thank you.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.880
- Thank you so much, both of you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.950
- Mm!
- Yeah. Thanks, guys.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.119
- See you guys.
- Drive safe.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.495
Honey, is everything all
right? Or are you just tired?

39:28.166 --> 39:29.166
Bay?

39:32.003 --> 39:34.972
I'm trying to figure out whether
I should tell you guys something.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.075
Well, now you definitely should.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.277
Honey?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.038
Hi.

40:08.073 --> 40:11.208
Sorry I had to take off.
Plumbing disaster averted.

40:11.243 --> 40:14.111
Whatever's left to clean
up, just leave it to me.

40:16.981 --> 40:20.985
You want to tell us why you let
a fugitive move into our house?
