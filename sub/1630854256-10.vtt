WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:06.607
My name is Melina Devlin,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.042
and you need to tell me
everything that you learned

00:08.142 --> 00:10.944
about Simon Williams
if you want to survive.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.946
Melina Devlin. CIA.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.316
<i>Her name is not Melina Devlin.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:16.617
It's Morgan Miller.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.119
I think you're going to tell me

00:18.219 --> 00:19.887
everything you've learned
about Simon Williams.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.590
You're standing inside
Simon Williams.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.759
<i>The CIA's most successful
assassination program.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:27.895
You think someone's using
the program for personal gain?

00:29.163 --> 00:30.464
<i>Why everyone connected</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:31.732
<i>to Simon Williams
is being killed.</i>

00:31.832 --> 00:33.467
All the people dying
are witnesses?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.769
Class photo of the inaugural
Simon Williams group.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.071
Hollace Kilbride.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.772
Who's got a target on his back.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.274
<i>Hey, did one of you shoot
Morgan Miller?</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:41.275
Yeah. Why?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.543
She's gone. Again.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.977
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome to LAX.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.747
We hope you enjoy your stay
in Los Angeles.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.831
Any luck locating Kilbride?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.700
Not yet. His phone
and vehicle are both offline.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.502
Fatima and Rountree are heading
to his place now.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.304
Okay, where did
you have him last?

01:43.404 --> 01:45.173
Here in the building,
several hours ago.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.474
But nothing since.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.775
Did anyone
see him leave?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.943
No. I've gone through
our security footage.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.945
I have no idea how he managed
to get out of here

01:52.045 --> 01:54.415
without being seen.
But he just vanished.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.017
Without a word
and without a trace.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.052
Damn it.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.354
Yo.
Yo.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.523
Nobody's watching the place
that I can see.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.925
No sign of a vehicle.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.594
What do you want to do?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.329
What do I want to do?

02:08.429 --> 02:10.864
I want to go to a hot yoga class
and spend the day at the beach.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.866
But doesn't look like that's
happening any time soon.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.469
Hot yoga's not really my thing.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.771
Oh, you are missing out.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.674
On a room full of sweaty,
smelly people?

02:20.774 --> 02:23.143
Oh, yeah? What, you
more of a Zumba guy?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.712
Not even close.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.480
I know how much you
like Kensi's shorts.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.015
I bet you've got
a whole drawer

02:28.115 --> 02:30.418
full of Spandex for
those cha-cha moves.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.753
♪ Cha, cha, cha-cha-cha. ♪

02:33.587 --> 02:35.022
Can't take you anywhere.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.126
<i>How could you not know
this? You're his assistant.</i>

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
He's extremely private.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.895
He's also the head of OSP,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.631
which means that he's
got responsibilities.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.233
He needs to be reachable 24/7.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.000
What is going on here?

02:48.035 --> 02:50.471
No one in this whole operation
knows where your boss is.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.105
We've already
established that.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.574
But you don't even know
where to start looking.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.808
How is that even possible?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.677
He's not exactly
a team player.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.346
Where is everyone?

02:58.446 --> 03:00.113
All nonessential personnel
were sent home.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.216
You don't have the
authority to do that.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.551
No.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.386
But she does.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.455
The director sent us

03:07.555 --> 03:09.257
and as SAC of the Hawai'i
field office,

03:09.357 --> 03:10.591
Agent Tennant has jurisdiction

03:10.691 --> 03:12.125
over the entire
Pacific Rim.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.061
Don't worry, boys.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.163
I won't make you
clean your rooms.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.641
Well.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.914
Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:34.014 --> 03:35.316
You sure you want to do that?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.717
No.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.819
What choice do we have?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.289
All right.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.223
Better you than me.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.268
Uh, please tell me
you have the code.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.203
Yeah, Shyla sent it.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.605
I thought it was a text.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.139
Maybe it was an email.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.174
Oh, no,
honestly, Officer,

04:01.275 --> 04:02.610
it's my boss's house.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.244
Do we don't have
permission to enter?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.813
No, not, exactly.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.215
See, what happened was,
he's actually missing.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.251
We need to go, like, now.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.020
Hey, relax, Nancy Drew.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.888
Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.391
Half the time I don't even
think Kilbride likes me.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.126
And he's definitely
not gonna like me

04:19.226 --> 04:21.395
if he knows that I broke
into his house.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.564
We're just
looking around to see

04:23.664 --> 04:25.599
if we can find some clues
as to where he is.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.435
Admiral Kilbride?

04:27.535 --> 04:30.237
It's Agent Namazi and Rountree!

04:30.338 --> 04:32.540
Yeah, yeah, uh,
she let herself in.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.908
I'm just following her lead.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.949
I got a bad feeling
about this.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.817
Yeah, that's
because you believe in ghosts.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.619
Have you ever seen a ghost?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.220
Because I have.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.557
Okay, Egon.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.159
<i>Every original member</i>

04:52.259 --> 04:54.027
of the Simon Williams group
has been killed off

04:54.127 --> 04:55.596
except Kilbride.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.865
He's the only one who can
testify before congress

04:57.965 --> 05:00.401
that this shadow faction
has taken over the program.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.970
Which means finding Kilbride
and protecting him

05:03.070 --> 05:05.105
is our number one priority.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.674
Well, it would be a hell
of a lot easier to do

05:06.774 --> 05:08.241
if you hadn't sent
our entire staff home.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.778
Hey, you got us.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.046
And I brought in the help of
Special Agent Afloat Lucy Tara.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.915
She's in the admiral's
office now.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.283
Hopefully she'll find something.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.518
Oh, she's about to
find out just how much

05:17.618 --> 05:18.452
he doesn't like when people

05:18.552 --> 05:19.553
go through his things.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.921
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it

05:21.021 --> 05:22.255
if we manage
to keep him alive,

05:22.356 --> 05:24.124
unlike the rest
of his Simon Williams buddies.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.460
Because of who we're dealing
with, we have to assume

05:26.560 --> 05:28.629
that the secrecy
of this location

05:28.729 --> 05:30.764
and its personnel
have been compromised.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.366
In fact, I'm sure
we're probably

05:32.466 --> 05:33.901
under surveillance
as we speak.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.136
Which is why I sent
everyone home.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.271
For their own protection.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.874
Call Sabatino,
see if he has anything

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
on the Simon Williams
project, as well as

05:43.043 --> 05:45.145
on Morgan Miller.
Got it.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.414
Who's Sabatino?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.548
Former CIA contact.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.816
Y'all trust him?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.551
Probably.
More than likely.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.219
Okay, well, that's encouraging.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.387
Agent Callen,

05:53.487 --> 05:55.423
you're, uh,
former CIA as well?

05:55.523 --> 05:56.757
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.891
Why am I just finding out
about this now?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.927
Because it's not relevant.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.995
Maybe we should be
the judge of that.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.631
He has nothing to do with
the Simon Williams project,

06:03.731 --> 06:05.599
if that's what
you're getting at.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.934
And yet they've
managed to stay

06:07.034 --> 06:09.069
one step ahead
of all our best efforts.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.838
You don't want to go there.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.140
The Simon Williams project
was a urban legend

06:13.240 --> 06:15.008
when I worked for them.
If you want to waste

06:15.108 --> 06:16.910
your time looking into my past
employment history, be my guest.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.113
But, uh, you'll also need
to look into Tennant's past.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.015
Turns out I'm not
the only one

06:22.115 --> 06:23.717
in the room
that worked for the CIA.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.223
They had a great health plan.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.826
Mm-hmm.
All right, we need to work
together, which means

06:32.926 --> 06:36.296
we need to know if
we're missing anything.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.498
Not in my history.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.999
Mine, either.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.367
Look, guys, I just found out
about Simon Williams

06:40.468 --> 06:41.835
a few days ago.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.403
So you're taking
the lead, right?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.738
I'm guessing you have a plan?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.807
Find Kilbride.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.109
Mm-hmm.
Protect him,
take out the bad guys.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.343
Pretty simple.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.079
Why didn't we think of that?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.915
Well, that'd be a whole lot
easier if someone

06:55.015 --> 06:56.850
in this office
knew where he is.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.986
Kilbride probably knew
they were coming after him.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.589
He may have ghosted us
for our own safety.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.356
Or they already have him.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.464
Hey, you see a laptop anywhere?
No.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.165
No laptop.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.667
Only junk mail.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.035
No magazines.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.704
He doesn't even have
a TV in here.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.238
Are you sure he lives here?

07:18.338 --> 07:20.508
This place doesn't feel
like Kilbride.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.510
Well, it's a rental.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.444
And you know Kilbride hates L.A.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.647
Yeah, but still...

07:26.747 --> 07:28.281
there's nothing personal
in sight.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.951
Feels like
a model unit.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.687
Oh, maybe he just
uses the address

07:33.787 --> 07:35.723
and he really lives
somewhere else.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.357
Apparently Hetty has

07:37.457 --> 07:39.960
a lot of houses
under various aliases.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.328
Well, if that was the case,

07:41.428 --> 07:43.631
I'm sure Shyla
would have told us.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.998
Yeah, well, if only she knew.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.307
Rountree?

08:35.415 --> 08:36.750
You find anything?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.552
The admiral's
pretty by the book.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.520
I don't think
he leaves anything to chance

08:40.621 --> 08:42.455
or any clues as
to where to find him.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.958
Oh, he does have a pretty
nice cigar collection

08:45.058 --> 08:47.127
and some really great
scotch, however.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.495
Great.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.298
We can stake out bars
and tobacco shops.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.167
What about
the Simon Williams project?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.936
If he has anything on it,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.806
it's not in the OSP system
or his personal files.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.107
Sir!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.042
Agents Namazi and Rountree
were attacked

09:02.142 --> 09:04.344
at Kilbride's house.
Agent Namazi is okay.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.046
Agent Rountree was abducted.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.920
Fatima!

09:13.020 --> 09:14.187
Excuse me.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.956
They took Rountree.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.024
What? Who took him?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.225
I don't know.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.693
They were,
they were tac'd up,

09:19.793 --> 09:22.162
and they had gas masks.
And they hit us

09:22.262 --> 09:24.297
hard and fast
with flash-bangs

09:24.397 --> 09:25.599
and CS gas.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.235
I can't even tell you
how many there were.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.369
Was he injured?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.672
I don't know, I don't know.
I mean...

09:32.673 --> 09:33.707
I heard a shotgun and...

09:33.807 --> 09:35.308
I thought he went down, but...

09:35.408 --> 09:36.777
but I don't see any blood.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.811
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.079
No, no, no. It's not your fault.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.247
This could've been you.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.414
I wish it had been.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.017
Hey, don't you
ever say that.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.353
Callen and Sam are
on their way, so why

09:46.453 --> 09:47.354
don't you let Deeks
take you home.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.421
No.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.589
No way.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.224
Not as long
as Rountree is missing.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.826
Okay, you know what?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.261
Here.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.664
You're gonna take ten
to let your lungs air out.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.198
You're gonna let
the shock wear off.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.167
And then I want you to
call Shyla and tell her

10:00.267 --> 10:02.569
anything and everything
you can remember, got it?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.304
Okay.
Okay.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.673
Hey.

10:05.773 --> 10:06.974
We're gonna find him.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.009
I promise you
we're gonna find him.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.016
Any sign of Agent Rountree?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.485
No, sir. His phone went
dark after they were hit.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.887
Traffic cams?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.388
Searching, but
Fatima didn't see

10:21.488 --> 10:22.522
their vehicles, so
I'm not even sure

10:22.622 --> 10:23.991
what we're looking for.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.893
Something they could get
him into relatively easy.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.627
Probably more than
one vehicle.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.629
I do have some good news.
Vostanik Sabatino

10:29.730 --> 10:31.164
came through for us
and provided a list

10:31.264 --> 10:32.766
of CIA officers
who worked

10:32.866 --> 10:34.501
with Morgan Miller
in the past.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.036
He said she was
particularly close

10:36.136 --> 10:37.470
with one David Ellis.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.473
They were both officially
listed as inspectors

10:40.573 --> 10:42.075
with the Department
of Agriculture.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.346
The only farm these two ever
set foot in is Camp Peary.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.981
Put out a BOLO
for Morgan's arrest

10:48.081 --> 10:50.417
and have Agent Tara
help you find anything we can

10:50.517 --> 10:52.019
on this David Ellis.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.254
Family, friends, colleagues.
And your former CIA contact,

10:54.354 --> 10:56.890
any more information
on the Simon Williams project?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.026
No. It was before his time. Well...

10:59.126 --> 11:01.361
the original was,
not this shadow version.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.030
Push him to find
anything we can.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.232
And connect me
with the Director of the CIA.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.233
Sir?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.534
This is their mess.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.302
And unless they want it
in the news,

11:09.402 --> 11:10.871
they need to cooperate with us

11:10.971 --> 11:12.672
to find out
who we're dealing with.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.174
What if they won't
take your call?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.542
Then call SECNAV.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.677
And then the director of ODNI.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.579
It is time to rattle some cages.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.015
Aye, aye, sir.
Rattling away.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.419
Hey.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.455
This is military-grade stuff.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.690
I wouldn't expect
anything less.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.625
Yeah, if these guys
are going rogue,

11:32.726 --> 11:34.862
they might be trying
to buy weapons off the books,

11:34.962 --> 11:37.364
which means they'll need
a supplier.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.333
And who do we know that could
be that local supplier?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.669
Nina Barnes.
Mm-hmm.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.272
And she knows Kilbride.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.207
Even if she didn't
arm these guys,

11:47.307 --> 11:49.609
she may be able to tell us where
Kilbride might be holed up.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.112
I'll have Kensi and
Deeks pay her a visit.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.689
I think I know why we didn't
find any blood from Rountree.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.292
Less than lethal round.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.693
Beanbag round.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.261
Usually fired from a shotgun.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.696
They wanted to take him alive.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.598
The fact that they took
Rountree leads me to believe

12:11.698 --> 12:13.300
that they don't have
the admiral yet.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.468
They probably took him hoping he
knows where his boss is hiding.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.138
Except that Kilbride's
not hiding, he's hunting.
Either way,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.941
they're probably still hoping
he'll help them find Kilbride.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.375
He doesn't know.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.544
So he'll be torture for
information he doesn't have.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.815
But it buys us
some time and opportunity.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.549
If they don't kill him first.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.618
Okay, let's at least try
and pretend like

12:31.718 --> 12:33.553
we're thinking
positively here, okay?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.223
Yeah.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.294
Whew!
Where is your boss?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.030
Well...

12:43.130 --> 12:44.798
unfortunately
I'm unemployed,

12:44.898 --> 12:46.900
so I don't have a boss.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.302
If you guys are hiring,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.939
I always thought I'd be
a pretty good flight attendant.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.978
I'll take that as a "no."

12:58.979 --> 13:01.548
Special Agent Devin Rountree,

13:01.648 --> 13:05.218
former FBI now working
for NCIS's

13:05.318 --> 13:06.619
Office of Special Projects.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.155
What?

13:09.656 --> 13:10.757
You've got the wrong guy.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.459
My name is Dean Rossmore.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.527
I'm a personal trainer.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.729
Or at least I was.
My old boss...

13:18.665 --> 13:21.869
Where is
Admiral Hollace Kilbride?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.403
Who?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.941
I can do this all day.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.877
Somehow I doubt that.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.047
But, uh, I'd like
to see you try.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.086
Anybody ever tell you
you hit like a girl?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.956
Well?
Very professional.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.524
Military-grade weapons
and tactics.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.792
Yeah, they were pros.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.327
Match the Simon Williams MO.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.896
Yeah, we're running down
a local arms broker

13:48.996 --> 13:50.463
in case they stocked up here.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.399
And they used less than lethal
force to abduct an agent.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.534
They might want to trade him
for Kilbride.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.003
Except we don't have Kilbride.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.939
Does he trust anyone
outside of this office?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.374
I'm not sure
Kilbride trusts anyone,

14:01.474 --> 14:03.243
including anyone in this office.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.444
Family or friends?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.279
I'm not sure Kilbride
has friends.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.815
Well, what about this former
colleague of his, Colonel Ladd?

14:08.916 --> 14:11.084
Kilbride reached out
to all of NCIS

14:11.184 --> 14:13.954
to see if there was a position
that he might be able to fill.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.256
Shyla already checked.
He hasn't seen him.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.259
He would probably say that
even if he was helping him.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.994
Kilbride wouldn't put
anyone else in danger.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.395
That's why he went dark from us.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.032
He does have a son,
but they're estranged.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.633
Well, that doesn't mean
our Simon Williams team

14:26.733 --> 14:28.268
won't use him
to get to Kilbride.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.770
I don't suppose you know
where the son is?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.472
No, I couldn't even tell you
his name.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.740
Shyla probably knows.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.108
I don't mean to interrupt.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.343
You're not.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.544
Tell me you found something.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.879
I did. Unfortunately,
it's not great.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.681
Ernie and I were
looking for any activity

14:41.781 --> 14:43.350
on the dark web
that we may be able

14:43.450 --> 14:45.752
to link to activity
of the Simon Williams group,

14:45.852 --> 14:47.988
Morgan Miller,
and our new potential player,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.257
David Ellis.
We also looked to see

14:50.357 --> 14:53.860
if the admiral had any recent
activity on the dark web.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.262
The admiral?
It took us six months

14:55.362 --> 14:57.464
to get him to use a cell phone.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.798
What the hell is this?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.400
It's called
the Dead Sector.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.703
Basically, it's a dark web
murder-for-hire website.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.838
It's entirely anonymous
and all transactions

15:05.939 --> 15:08.141
are untraceable
thanks to cryptocurrency.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.178
Craigslist for
serial killers. Essentially.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.480
Someone, most likely
the Simon Williams group,

15:13.580 --> 15:16.683
posted all our identities
with $200,000 bounties

15:16.783 --> 15:18.385
on each of us.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.220
So now every gang, cartel,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.655
psychopath and hitman
is gunning for our heads.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.991
Pretty much.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.558
Alert Cyber and the NSA.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.328
Shut this site down now.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.031
How's that positive thinking
going for you?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.214
No drink service
on this airline? What kind of,

15:47.314 --> 15:49.182
what kind of flight is this?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.385
You're tougher than your
partner, I'll give you that.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.288
I don't have a partner.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.823
The cutie in the hijab?

15:56.923 --> 16:00.327
Well, I mean, she was cute
when we grabbed her.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.928
She isn't looking too good now.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.064
Listen.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.434
I'm gonna have
to use the restroom

16:07.534 --> 16:09.169
really, really soon.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.803
All right?
So unless

16:10.903 --> 16:12.972
you want this to get
really, really awkward

16:13.073 --> 16:14.274
for all of us...

16:14.374 --> 16:16.809
Oh, this will be over
long before that.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.678
Are you sure?

16:18.778 --> 16:21.381
Seemed to me like you
were enjoying this.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.383
Maybe a little bit too much?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.518
Mm.
And even if I was
who-who you guys

16:25.618 --> 16:28.688
think I am, which I-I'm not,

16:28.788 --> 16:31.158
I don't think you really
want me to start talking.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.260
You know,
so you can keep

16:33.360 --> 16:35.795
getting your kink on?

16:35.895 --> 16:37.930
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

16:38.031 --> 16:39.932
Nah, I'm not really
into the rough stuff,

16:40.033 --> 16:42.535
but, you know,
who am I to judge?

16:42.635 --> 16:45.205
You'd like me to keep
wasting my time doing this.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.274
You'll take
a world-class beating

16:47.374 --> 16:48.641
if it means stalling us

16:48.741 --> 16:50.677
and buying your people more time
to find you.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.146
World class?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.115
It's not even close.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.250
My mama gave out

16:57.350 --> 16:59.852
way worse beatings than this.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.388
You two?

17:01.488 --> 17:04.091
Y'all are cute,
y'all are amateurs.

17:04.191 --> 17:08.128
This is honestly embarrassing.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.306
You still feeling embarrassed?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.375
Where are we
with the traffic cams?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.043
Call me back.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.645
No one in Ops
is answering.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.247
What the hell is up with that?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.981
Any luck with the neighbors?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.917
Uh, no, unfortunately not a lot
of people are home right now,

17:31.017 --> 17:32.585
but I left notes for
them to call us back,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.487
so maybe we'll get lucky.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.856
Lucky?
We-we can't afford to get lucky.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.758
Rountree is
running out of time.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.660
What about,
what about satellite footage?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.729
Maybe one was passing over
when this all went down.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.397
Okay, Fatima, you need to take

17:44.497 --> 17:46.333
a breath and calm down.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.700
Okay?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.136
There is nothing left
for us to do here.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.803
Let me take you home.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.806
I'm not going home.
Stop asking me!

17:56.109 --> 17:57.810
Okay. Okay.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.314
Then at least let's
head back to Ops.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.982
And I'll drive.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.885
You can beat yourself up
on the way.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.125
Heyo.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.793
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.595
No, no, no, you didn't,
you didn't startle me.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.063
I saw you.
I was just...

18:17.164 --> 18:18.531
practicing some tai chi.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.899
Tai chi? Mm.
Yeah.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.301
What are you doing here?
Where's Kensi?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.170
She took Agent Namazi home.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.437
What's the story here?

18:24.537 --> 18:26.773
Nina Barnes.
She owns this bakery.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.375
She's also
a high-end arms dealer.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.843
Nothing comes to the West Coast
without her knowing about it.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.780
Oh, interesting, and you
haven't arrested her because?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.648
That's a good question.
She's, uh, "retired."

18:35.748 --> 18:37.784
She's been helpful
on other cases.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.118
But most importantly
she has shared history

18:39.219 --> 18:40.787
with Admiral Kilbride.
Shared history?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.789
What kind of history, professional?

18:42.889 --> 18:43.923
Sexual?

18:44.023 --> 18:44.891
What?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.293
Yeah? No?
I don't know.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.927
Oh, God, now I got
that in my head.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.429
Oh, yeah, that's right,
they warned me.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.564
You're the sensitive one.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.333
Who, who warned you?

18:53.433 --> 18:54.801
That I was--
I'm not the sensitive one.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.936
No, that's definitely Sam.
Yeah, that's definitely Sam.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.272
You know, big and tough
on the outside,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.907
soft and gooey
on the inside.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.909
He's like a,
like a human Hot Pocket.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.245
Ooh, like a Hot Pocket,
I like that. Yeah.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.647
No, I'm more of a,
more of a street dog, lone wolf.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.749
Oh, sure, yeah,
of course.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.385
Yeah, that explains
the lack of grooming.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.259
Friends of yours?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.128
Uh-uh.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.131
Nina, this is
Special Agent Nick Torres.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.733
He's also with NCIS,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
except for he's from
fancy-pants Washington.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.237
When's the last time
you spoke with

19:30.337 --> 19:31.471
or saw Kilbride?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.605
Who wants to know?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.241
I-I do.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.875
I literally,
I literally just asked you.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.645
Sorry, uh, I'm not at liberty

19:38.745 --> 19:41.180
to discuss that--
doctor-client privilege.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.482
Wait, you're a doctor?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.951
Yeah, well, I have a PhD
in military history.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.387
So... yes.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.588
Are you married?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.189
Huh?
No.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.724
Girlfriend?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.360
It's complicated.
What is happening here?

19:53.460 --> 19:54.661
Can we focus?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.596
Yeah, I am focused.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.064
On cinnamon buns here.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.366
Oh.
Oh, right.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.767
So, uh, what

20:00.867 --> 20:03.102
makes you such a special agent?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.171
This is happening.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.440
Guaranteed, Hetty knows

20:07.540 --> 20:09.108
about
the Simon Williams project.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.644
Well, if she does, she's not
keeping anything here about it

20:11.744 --> 20:12.779
that I can find.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.347
Maybe
in the archives.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.983
I just got an encrypted email
from an anonymous sender.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.852
Mr. Simon Williams.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.721
Could be the guys
who have Rountree.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.189
How'd they get my email?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.491
They're CIA.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.925
Who knows
what they're capable of.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.193
Then why send it encrypted?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.828
It's worthless
if I can't open it.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.899
I just got
an anonymous text.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.768
What does it say?
"Leviticus 28."

20:35.868 --> 20:38.170
What is it, a bible reference?
Well, yes and no.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.507
Leviticus is the third book
of the Old Testament

20:40.607 --> 20:43.376
and the Torah,
but it's only 27 chapters.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.544
There is no chapter 28.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.879
I knew that.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.215
It could be the password.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.184
Yeah, then again it could
also be a clever ploy

20:52.285 --> 20:54.521
to launch a cyber
or malware attack against us

20:54.621 --> 20:56.389
just when we need this most.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.392
<i>You ever heard
of Simon Williams?</i>

20:59.492 --> 21:00.693
Uh, I don't know.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.861
Who is he?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.029
Simon Williams
is a CIA assassin.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.497
Oh, yeah,
I know that one.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.798
He was a wet boy.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.099
Carlos the Jackal type.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.101
Eh, it's more of
a Dread Pirate Roberts.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.269
Yeah.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.171
<i>Princess Bride.</i>
Nobody, really?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.473
Farm boy Westley

21:13.573 --> 21:15.174
becomes the Dread Pirate Roberts
only to find out

21:15.274 --> 21:17.577
he is one in a long line
of Dread Pirate Roberts.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.078
Seriously?

21:19.178 --> 21:21.047
Is he some kind of Rain Man
savant or something?

21:21.147 --> 21:23.049
Simon Williams
wasn't one person.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.917
He was a straw man
to take blame.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.019
But the program
was discontinued,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.722
that is until one rogue
group reactivated it

21:29.822 --> 21:31.624
for their own
unsanctioned purposes.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.360
I love your accent.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.994
Mm.
First time to L.A.?

21:35.094 --> 21:37.163
Has anyone come into town
looking to weapon-up?

21:37.263 --> 21:38.365
Anybody new?

21:38.465 --> 21:39.766
Somebody
with deep pockets.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.033
Obvious trade craft.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.301
I know this city
like the back of my hand.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.770
I can show you things
no one else can.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.738
There are highly trained professionals

21:45.838 --> 21:47.740
who are here to kill Kilbride.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.842
They've already kidnapped
an NCIS agent.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.479
They're probably torturing him
as we speak.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.581
Is he always this high strung?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.115
I just met him. Mm.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.850
I'm sorry for
your loss. Look.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.118
I don't know
where Kilbride is, but...

21:59.218 --> 22:00.853
he can take care of himself,
trust me.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.855
He is a big boy and now

22:02.955 --> 22:05.525
he has a very accurate gun.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.294
He wanted an Accuracy International

22:08.395 --> 22:10.797
L115A3 sniper rifle.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.499
What does he need
a sniper rifle for?

22:12.599 --> 22:13.900
Didn't you just say there are

22:14.000 --> 22:15.368
highly skilled operatives
trying to kill him?

22:15.468 --> 22:17.837
Hello? Aren't you supposed
to be a detective?

22:17.937 --> 22:20.172
Was a detective,
now I'm an investigator.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.241
Wait, you're not
a special agent? Huh.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.043
Eh, this is awkward.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.578
How did Kilbride contact you?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.680
He left an order on my machine,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.248
and came by the next day
to pick it up.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.517
I also put in

22:30.617 --> 22:32.952
an extra dozen
of red velvet cupcakes.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.687
Oh, he brought those to work.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.255
I knew that was weird.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.824
They're good, right?

22:37.924 --> 22:39.559
I don't know.
I have a gluten allergy.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.761
Of course. Yeah.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.096
Wait, what's that mean?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.865
We have any idea who sent it?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.435
It's bounced around
repeatedly before coming here.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.837
Last IP was a proxy server
out of Khartoum,

22:50.937 --> 22:52.605
but I doubt that's
where it originated.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.641
Could be Admiral Kilbride
trying to get a message to us

22:54.741 --> 22:56.509
without it being intercepted.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.545
Or the Simon Williams group's
ransom demands.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.046
I don't think so.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.914
Someone had both our phone
numbers and they took steps

23:02.014 --> 23:04.350
to send us a message that
we had to share to open.

23:04.451 --> 23:07.454
There's no reason
for them to go to such lengths.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.721
Only one way to find out.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.256
Open it.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.761
It's an audio file.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.163
Let's hear what they want.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.533
Sounds like
you've gotten yourselves

23:20.633 --> 23:21.834
in a bit of a pickle.

23:21.934 --> 23:25.438
I warned Hollace
his Simon Williams days

23:25.538 --> 23:27.940
would come back
to bite him in the ass.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.778
You are all quite capable,
and far be it for me

23:31.878 --> 23:34.146
to tell you what to do,

23:34.246 --> 23:36.616
but you might want to contact

23:36.716 --> 23:38.718
an old friend, Gwen Johns,

23:38.818 --> 23:41.454
and inquire
about the availability

23:41.554 --> 23:42.822
of Jimmy McCann.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.056
You know these people?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.157
No.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.358
Good luck.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.294
Oh, and Alden?

23:48.394 --> 23:49.862
Don't think for a moment

23:49.962 --> 23:53.866
I've forgotten about
the $600 you still owe me

23:53.966 --> 23:56.636
from the Monaco fiasco.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.404
<i>You</i> know this person?

23:58.505 --> 24:00.607
Son of a bitch.
It's Hetty, isn't it?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.975
Yeah, but I have no idea

24:03.075 --> 24:04.711
about the $600
she's talking about.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.145
Yeah, right.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.147
Okay, I thought
she's been AWOL for months.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.817
She still is.
Well, then how the hell does she
know what we're doing here?

24:10.917 --> 24:13.185
Behold the many mysteries
of Hetty.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.788
Some say she's a witch. Easy.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.625
At least we know
she's still alive.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.227
So who are these people
she's talking about?

24:21.327 --> 24:22.929
I have several Gwen Johns.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.932
The most notable locally
is a Hollywood casting director.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.500
Does that make sense
to you guys?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.135
Hetty used the cover
of a Hollywood costumer

24:29.235 --> 24:30.703
when she was with
the CIA, so yes.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.271
And Jimmy McCann?

24:32.371 --> 24:33.806
Looking.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.207
If Gwen Johns is a
casting director, and Hetty

24:35.307 --> 24:36.643
said that we should
reach out to her to check

24:36.743 --> 24:38.511
on this guy's availability,
he's got to be an actor.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.346
An actor?

24:42.114 --> 24:45.084
An actor that looks
a lot like Admiral Kilbride.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.486
Huh.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.057
What's happening here,
you following me?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.659
I need a ride.
Took an Uber here.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.160
You know NCIS
travel budgets.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.563
It's, uh, one rental
per your two agents.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.065
Yeah, I just thought that maybe
they'd make an exception, yeah?

24:59.165 --> 25:00.533
No...

25:01.601 --> 25:03.369
Gun!

25:18.017 --> 25:20.486
You okay?
Yeah, I'm cool.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.757
That was a little too sloppy
to be Simon Williams group.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.459
Yeah, probably somebody looking
to collect on that bounty.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.729
Welcome to Hollywood.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.430
Huh.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.667
I'll call the Uber.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.636
Yeah.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.353
Last chance.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.355
Where's Kilbride?

25:57.456 --> 25:58.891
Bring the hijabi in here.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.693
I'm gonna kill her
in front of you.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.862
No, wait. Wait, wait.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.433
All right.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.669
There's a boatshed...

26:09.769 --> 26:11.503
down by the docks, all right,
at the marina.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.473
We use it as
a safe house.

26:15.842 --> 26:18.611
That's where Kilbride's
holed up.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.181
And they say
torture never works.

26:23.382 --> 26:24.951
If you're lying...

26:25.051 --> 26:28.154
I'm gonna kill your girlfriend
in front of you.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.759
She's not my girlfriend.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.360
Oh.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.095
Well, that's too bad.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.596
Like I said,

26:37.697 --> 26:39.498
she was kind of cute
before all this.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.233
Let me see her.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.335
Mm, I don't think so.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.804
Let me see her!

26:44.904 --> 26:46.873
Trust me, it's not pretty.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.942
Fatima?!

26:50.042 --> 26:52.144
Fatima!

26:56.182 --> 26:57.884
Shiver me timbers.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.352
Oh! Hey, I heard what
happened. You good?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.254
Me, yes.
My truck, not so much.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.556
Okay, who cares about a
stupid truck, babe? Come on.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.959
It's America, all right?
We love our trucks.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.828
Okay, are we gonna
tell Rosa about this?

27:08.928 --> 27:10.429
I don't know. This wasn't
exactly in the handbook.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.698
How's Fatima?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.365
She's freaked out
and blaming herself.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.967
I mean, this whole
thing is a mess.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.535
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.970
But I do know what we're
gonna do after that,

27:18.070 --> 27:19.638
which is go on
a family vacation.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.640
Someplace warm
and quiet and safe.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.209
I like the idea of that.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.711
Yeah, someplace
like Winnipeg.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.345
Winnipeg?
Uh-huh.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.847
Do you even know
where that is?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.849
No, I just like
saying it, Winnipeg.

27:29.949 --> 27:33.519
Okay, we need a plan.
Yeah, we need a plan.

27:33.619 --> 27:34.954
They want Kilbride,
we give them this Kilbride.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.823
They'll know we're never
really gonna trade him.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.257
We're not gonna trade him.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.625
We're gonna let them grab him.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.360
So they're gonna have
an agent and a civilian.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.962
How's that gonna
help us?

27:43.062 --> 27:44.296
Are we gonna put a tracker
on him? These guys are pros.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.431
They're not that stupid.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.134
We have a-a boatshed
in the marina.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.936
We use it for interrogations,
things like that.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.771
It's separate from this facility
for security reasons.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.873
Jimmy McCann,
our Kilbride stand-in,

27:53.973 --> 27:56.275
he will arrive looking
like he's holed up there.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.144
When they move in
to grab him,

27:58.244 --> 28:00.012
we take them.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.014
You're assuming that Morgan
Miller and her Simon Williams

28:02.114 --> 28:03.816
group know
about the boatshed.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.618
You said this facility was
probably under surveillance.

28:06.719 --> 28:09.021
That's only
because it's the CIA.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.023
OSP is one
of the best kept secrets.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.658
Most people think
this is a water station.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.260
If they know
about this place,

28:14.360 --> 28:16.562
I guarantee you they know
about the boatshed as well.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.897
We use that
to our advantage.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.465
Okay, well,
that works in theory.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.333
But if they're watching
the boatshed, they're gonna

28:21.433 --> 28:23.002
know it's a trap the second
they see anyone else

28:23.102 --> 28:24.703
walk in other than
our Kilbride decoy.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.839
They're not gonna
see us walk in.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.776
Oh, no? You got
a secret tunnel?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.077
Hmm.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.812
Something like that.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.116
Need any help?

28:37.216 --> 28:38.450
Lucy Tara.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.718
Fatima Namazi.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.821
I'm sorry
about your partner.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.956
He'll be okay.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.358
He's smart and he's tough.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.694
I hear the same
about you.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.064
Not today.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.133
Help yourself
to whatever you need.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.602
Thanks.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.971
OSP has a great reputation.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.207
I'm sure your team could
handle this on its own,

29:01.307 --> 29:03.342
but with the rest
of us here,

29:03.442 --> 29:06.145
these guys don't stand a chance
against us, am I right?

29:07.914 --> 29:10.149
I sure as hell hope so.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.555
They inside yet?
Should be any minute.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.724
Kensi, what about outside?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.359
Not that we saw.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.461
If somebody's watching the
boatshed, we didn't see them.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.330
These guys are good. They're not
your run-of-the-mill criminals.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.866
Agent Namazi and Rountree
learned that the hard way.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.935
Yeah, well, at least
there aren't a bunch of

29:29.035 --> 29:31.437
trigger-happy yahoos out there
gunning for all of us as well.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.039
Oh, wait, there is.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.540
Just keep your head on a swivel.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.875
Oh, it's on a swivel.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.676
And we're focused.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.819
This is not Hawai'i water.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.320
Same ocean.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.057
Well, the lack of visibility
and smell say otherwise.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.359
Oh, man, please tell me
that all of this is gonna

29:53.459 --> 29:54.726
come off in the shower.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.028
Give me a break.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.163
You think the Potomac's
any cleaner?

29:57.263 --> 29:58.797
I don't swim
in there, either.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.137
Dude, I swear I've seen
this place on Airbnb.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.738
You guys take the high ground.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.141
We reserve the penthouse
for our guests.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.477
Great, I'm sure it's just
as fragrant up there.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.945
It's the marina.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.546
Seriously, how do
you guys work here?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.248
What do you mean?

30:17.984 --> 30:20.286
Oh, you're like the two
crazy old cat ladies

30:20.386 --> 30:23.122
who doesn't even realize
their own house smells.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.294
Something like that.

30:29.695 --> 30:32.464
Our Kilbride stand-in
just landed.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.034
He's heading to you now.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.871
You good, Jimmy?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.339
Sound as a pound, mate.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.773
Oh, thank you.

30:41.874 --> 30:42.975
Agents Torres and Tennant
will secure you upstairs.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.410
McCANN:
All right, no worries.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.012
I know the routine.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.280
Not the first time I've doubled
the admiral, you know.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.983
Hey, let's keep those
holstered there, cowboy.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.952
For our own safety.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.286
Just how many times have
you doubled the admiral?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.322
Oh, geez.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.823
Couple of times in D.C.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.726
Turkey, four times in Venezuela.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.128
Crazy times...

31:02.228 --> 31:03.529
Okay, story time can wait.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.796
I need you up here now.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.532
Aye, aye, captain.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.867
We'll talk, Jimmy.
Yes, sir.

31:18.644 --> 31:19.811
Showtime.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.248
We got two two-man teams.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.451
They're loaded for bear
with body armor.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.492
Federal agents!

31:52.778 --> 31:54.413
Don't even

31:54.513 --> 31:56.715
think about it.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.184
Hands.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.918
That a boy.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.857
None of these are
Morgan Miller. Kens?

32:07.126 --> 32:09.261
No. She's not here.

32:11.363 --> 32:14.000
She still has
Agent Rountree.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.246
You are looking
at hard time.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.415
How hard is
up to you.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.517
Your buddies are dead.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.452
They can't cooperate.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.287
But you can.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.057
Morgan Miller is going down

32:38.157 --> 32:39.825
and she's taking you with her

32:39.925 --> 32:41.627
unless, of course, you help us.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.195
How long are we
gonna waste on this?

32:43.295 --> 32:45.631
Well, right now he's our best
bet to finding Rountree.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.433
We know about Morgan Miller.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.668
We know about
the Simon Williams group.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.370
All right.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.538
Where is my partner, huh?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.173
Fatima, stop.
Fatima!

32:54.273 --> 32:55.741
Tell me where my partner is!
I know you know where he is!

32:55.841 --> 32:57.309
Fatima! Fatima!
Tell me where he is!

32:57.409 --> 32:58.910
Fatima!
Tell me!

32:59.011 --> 33:00.779
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Hey.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.614
We're on it, okay?

33:03.549 --> 33:04.550
Let me get you
some tea.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.951
I don't want any tea!

33:06.052 --> 33:07.586
Unless I can use it
to scald that guy.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.588
Okay.
What do their cell phones show?

33:09.688 --> 33:11.090
They've been all over.
I can't begin

33:11.190 --> 33:12.558
to predict a possible
location from this.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.926
Hey, Deeks, where are we
on the vehicles?

33:15.027 --> 33:16.362
Vehicles are clean.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.297
They shared some GPS
location searches,

33:18.397 --> 33:19.931
including this
parking lot.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.301
And I recognize another one
of them as Kilbride's addresses.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.835
I'm sending you
the list now.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.604
I can cross reference
it with their

33:25.704 --> 33:26.738
cell phone activity.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.074
Focus on the time

33:28.174 --> 33:29.408
that corresponds with
the attack at Kilbride's

33:29.508 --> 33:31.077
and wherever they
went after that.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.113
This is a window of about
two hours after the attack.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.947
Looks like they left the city.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.083
What's out there?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.285
That's like Mojave.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.387
Hmm, good place
to dump a body.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.823
Sorry.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.169
Answer it.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.138
He's not gonna ask you again.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.074
Maybe Fatima can convince him.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.744
The number that's calling is
coming from that same location

34:05.844 --> 34:07.613
in Mojave.
It's a jet boneyard

34:07.713 --> 34:09.047
not far from the Mojave
Air and Space Port.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.150
All right, we need to get
our people there ASAP.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.419
See if we can get a transport
helo out of El Segundo,

34:13.519 --> 34:15.154
then call local
law enforcement

34:15.254 --> 34:16.955
and have them put up some road
blocks in case they try to run.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.158
On it.
We're also gonna need
ground transport

34:19.258 --> 34:21.160
once we get there. What's
the closest military base?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.295
Edwards Air Force Base is
only about 20 miles from there.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.497
Get me the base commander,
maybe he'll lend us some wheels.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.099
Copy that.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.477
Ellis failed
their first check in.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.078
You try contacting him?

34:40.179 --> 34:42.214
He's not picking up.
Try calling one of the others.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.751
Went to voice mail.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.419
Damn it. They may have
run into resistance.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.621
From one old man? Should have
been an easy extraction.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.758
The admiral is
not a soft target.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.025
What do you want to do?

34:54.126 --> 34:56.162
Put everyone on high alert.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.597
Next check in is 15 minutes.
They miss that, we pull out.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.399
What about him?

35:00.499 --> 35:02.668
He's insurance.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.472
We're going on high alert.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.680
Tighten up the perimeter.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.015
Keep your eyes
and ears open.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.296
We may have company.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.830
Well, either we do
or we don't.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.365
We have some
dune buggies approaching.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.168
Could just be some off-roaders
joyriding in the desert.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.570
Or it could be
his rescue party.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.507
We're pulling out.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.143
All right, that's it.
We're pulling out.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.204
Excuse me?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.804
Federal agents! Drop it!

36:47.306 --> 36:50.175
He said drop it.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.881
Nice and easy,
hands behind your back.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.284
I had him.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.019
A simple thank you will suffice.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.086
"Mahola."

37:35.186 --> 37:36.422
It's mahalo.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.690
Yeah, I still had him.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.304
It's over, Miller.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.556
Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

38:10.656 --> 38:11.890
Miller is down. Everybody good?

38:11.990 --> 38:12.891
Yeah, we're good.

38:12.991 --> 38:13.925
All clear.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.193
Yeah, I'm solid.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.329
Nice work, people.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.966
Bring them home.
Yes, sir.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.669
Rountree?
Oh, my God.

38:23.769 --> 38:24.670
I'm okay.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.474
Oh.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.208
What did they do
to you?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.744
A little five knuckle facial.

38:32.844 --> 38:33.945
Yeah, you, uh...

38:34.045 --> 38:35.614
you don't look so good.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.349
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.385
Just a little jet-lagged.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.952
Ow!

38:41.052 --> 38:43.188
Oh, it hurts to smile.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.423
Yeah, don't do that.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.458
Your... your mouth is bleeding.

38:46.558 --> 38:47.693
It looks really gross.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.561
Really?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.497
Yeah.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.832
Oh, come here.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.436
Thank you, partner.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.607
She's dead.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.475
Yeah, it was
a nice shot.

39:03.575 --> 39:04.776
It was pretty risky.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.812
It wasn't us.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.314
Well, who took it then?

39:09.415 --> 39:10.716
It wasn't me.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.252
You certainly took
your sweet time.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.327
A little bit longer out here,

39:22.428 --> 39:25.330
I was gonna
turn into beef jerky.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.803
Okay, how in the world
did you know we were out here?

39:32.771 --> 39:34.806
Been following you.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.075
Just out of curiosity,

39:37.175 --> 39:39.678
you ever heard of teamwork?

39:41.647 --> 39:44.049
What do you call this?

40:00.165 --> 40:02.568
Well, I see you've made
yourself at home.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.069
Almost out of here.

40:04.169 --> 40:07.205
I guess we'll be seeing you
back in D.C.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.941
to testify before congress
on all of this, huh?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.810
Yeah, yeah.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.545
With Miller dead and...

40:13.645 --> 40:15.013
the rest of her group

40:15.113 --> 40:17.583
either in custody
or body bags,

40:17.683 --> 40:19.985
the Simon Williams program

40:20.085 --> 40:23.455
can be put to rest indefinitely.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.223
That's a good thing.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.259
That it is, that it is.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.729
I suppose I owe you
a big thank you

40:30.829 --> 40:33.198
for looking out for these kids.

40:34.232 --> 40:37.002
Well, these "kids" do
a pretty good job on their own.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.870
That they do,
that they do.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.639
But you know you worked

40:40.739 --> 40:42.608
really well with them and

40:42.708 --> 40:44.776
I truly think
they can benefit

40:44.876 --> 40:46.411
from spending more time

40:46.512 --> 40:48.446
with someone
with your experience.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.948
And I don't mind

40:50.048 --> 40:52.784
staying in Washington
for a bit.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.853
I thought maybe
we could work out

40:54.953 --> 40:57.856
some sort of an exchange?

40:59.658 --> 41:00.692
Yeah.

41:00.792 --> 41:01.993
I'm gonna have
to take a pass

41:02.093 --> 41:03.529
on that, besides,

41:03.629 --> 41:06.197
I think this place
is growing on you.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.235
Why do you hurt me?

41:11.236 --> 41:13.338
I'll see you around, Hollace.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.440
You better not have
taken any of my cigars.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.915
That son of a bitch.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.317
Thanks for the loaners.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.655
Thank you for helping us
find Rountree.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.256
Is he gonna be okay?

41:31.356 --> 41:33.391
Nothing a little ice, rest,
and dental work won't fix.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.393
Really, babe?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.195
Seriously,
thank you.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.264
It was great meeting
all of you.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.699
Likewise.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.400
If you guys ever
get to Hawai'i.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.702
Oh, you know it.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.070
I'm putting my transfer
in tomorrow morning.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.205
I wish.
Well, stay safe you guys.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.507
Bye.
See ya.
Bye. You, too.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.182
Ah, you guys
flying out tonight?

41:57.282 --> 41:58.984
Yeah, I'm trying to catch
a hop out of NAS North Island.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.319
But these guys
are flying commercial.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.454
Well, Parker ain't gonna
like it, but I do enjoy

42:03.555 --> 42:06.625
my hot towels and
complimentary socks.

42:06.725 --> 42:07.893
Okay.

42:07.993 --> 42:09.928
Thank you for everything.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.797
You, too.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.398
I'd like to
say it was fun but...

42:13.498 --> 42:16.067
No, all in all I think it went
pretty well. We should...

42:16.167 --> 42:18.970
maybe think about doing
this again sometime.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.339
Yeah, hard pass.

42:21.439 --> 42:22.841
No, thanks.
