00:15.404 --> 00:17.414
I think your mom should
go away more often.

00:18.699 --> 00:19.843
Do you think you
can arrange that?

00:19.867 --> 00:22.169
I'll see what I can do.

00:24.955 --> 00:26.423
- Hey...
- Yeah?

00:26.665 --> 00:28.258
Should we go up to my room?

00:28.292 --> 00:29.603
What about Owen?

00:29.627 --> 00:31.178
I'll put him in Charlie's room.

00:31.587 --> 00:33.013
No, let's stay here.

00:33.923 --> 00:36.183
Okay, but...

00:37.509 --> 00:39.728
Shh! Claudia.

00:40.679 --> 00:42.564
It's okay, she sleeps
through earthquakes.

00:49.647 --> 00:51.615
You have the softest skin.

00:55.861 --> 00:57.579
Bailey, wait.

00:57.947 --> 00:59.456
Bailey, stop.

01:05.579 --> 01:07.089
Bailey, no.

01:08.290 --> 01:09.466
No?

01:10.584 --> 01:11.927

When's your assignment due?

01:54.628 --> 01:56.013
Wednesday.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.515
I'm in hell.

01:58.841 --> 02:00.235
Why did I take an art class?

02:00.259 --> 02:02.102
You said it'd be an easy "B."

02:02.261 --> 02:03.697
Yeah, but that was
before I realized

02:03.721 --> 02:05.772
I don't have an artistic
bone in my body.

02:07.057 --> 02:09.536
Just take a picture of
Danny and then call it

02:09.560 --> 02:12.195
"a portrait of a guitarist
as a young man."

02:12.271 --> 02:14.156
You'll get an "A." Trust me.

02:14.732 --> 02:16.241
Good idea.

02:22.197 --> 02:23.915
What is that?

02:24.950 --> 02:25.885
You like it?

02:25.909 --> 02:27.169
It's pretty.

02:27.828 --> 02:28.847
I wrote it.

02:28.871 --> 02:29.973
You did, really?

02:29.997 --> 02:30.932
Yeah.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.434
Wait. Wait. Don't move.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.967
Turn this way. Look at me.

02:34.626 --> 02:35.812
Does it have lyrics?

02:35.836 --> 02:37.814
No, whenever I try
to write lyrics,

02:37.838 --> 02:40.557
it always comes out sounding
like bad nursery rhymes,

02:40.966 --> 02:44.311
like cat and hat, love, dove.

02:45.304 --> 02:46.980
I'm sure you're just
trying too hard.

02:47.848 --> 02:50.910
Face it, Jule, we're not all
little Shakespeares like you.

02:50.934 --> 02:52.444
You write poetry?

02:52.686 --> 02:53.747
Kind of.

02:53.771 --> 02:56.198
I mean, um... I used to.

02:56.774 --> 02:58.033
Oh, please.

02:58.776 --> 03:00.786
She wins the writing
award every year.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.579
So write me some lyrics.

03:02.613 --> 03:03.590
What, for that?

03:03.614 --> 03:05.383
Yeah. Why not?

03:05.407 --> 03:07.719
I don't know. I'm kind
of off the poetry thing.

03:07.743 --> 03:09.345
Oh, come on, it'd be great.

03:09.369 --> 03:10.889
I mean, we'd be like a
famous writing team,

03:10.913 --> 03:12.297
like Lennon and McCartney,

03:12.790 --> 03:13.975
and we'd be able to
tell interviewers

03:13.999 --> 03:17.020
"it all started here at 1:00 in the
morning in a smoky coffeehouse."

03:17.044 --> 03:18.772
It's 1:00?

03:18.796 --> 03:19.898
It's not 1:00.

03:19.922 --> 03:21.065
It's 1:06, actually.

03:21.089 --> 03:23.485
Oh, great! I'm in trouble.

03:23.509 --> 03:24.402
Come on, Jule. We gotta go.

03:24.426 --> 03:25.737
Oh, I don't know. I
think I'll stay.

03:25.761 --> 03:26.780
There you go.

03:26.804 --> 03:28.814
Stick around, watch
the sun rise.

03:28.972 --> 03:29.908
Yeah.

03:29.932 --> 03:32.160
Yeah, well, you can tell me
about it in the morning, okay?

03:32.184 --> 03:33.819
If I'm still alive.

03:34.144 --> 03:35.362
Okay...

03:37.689 --> 03:38.907
- You ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:39.066 --> 03:40.502
Uh...

03:40.526 --> 03:41.910
This is the bridge.

Charlie, where'd you say this
alleged nanny worked before,

03:58.335 --> 03:59.521
<i>The Love Boat?</i>

03:59.545 --> 04:01.523
Her name is Mona, and
she's very experienced.

04:01.547 --> 04:03.682
Yeah, at lounge acts.

04:04.007 --> 04:05.110
What's this, a bid?

04:05.134 --> 04:06.945
Yeah, a big one, so
don't get food on it.

04:06.969 --> 04:10.198
So did Mona have references,
or was she just kind of cute?

04:10.222 --> 04:11.241
She's not cute, all right?

04:11.265 --> 04:14.786
Charlie, see this line here,
this is where we show profit.

04:14.810 --> 04:17.497
A zero on this line
means no profit.

04:17.521 --> 04:19.082
I don't need to make a
profit on this, all right?

04:19.106 --> 04:20.959
I need to impress this guy. He
could give me a lot of work.

04:20.983 --> 04:22.752
Well, profit pays the
bills around here.

04:22.776 --> 04:24.879
I'll tell you what. You take
care of your responsibilities,

04:24.903 --> 04:26.163
I'll take care of mine.

04:32.035 --> 04:35.172

04:35.497 --> 04:37.725
Hey, you know, a little slack wouldn't
be the worst thing in the world.

04:37.749 --> 04:39.978
Not every bad thing that happens
around here is my fault.

04:40.002 --> 04:41.729
I mean, other people in this
family screw up, like...

04:41.753 --> 04:42.971
Me!

04:43.005 --> 04:43.940
Yeah, like Claudia.

04:43.964 --> 04:45.974
No. I mean me in the paper.

04:46.425 --> 04:47.777
"Stars of the future.

04:47.801 --> 04:50.196
The most gifted young
people in the Bay area."

04:50.220 --> 04:52.490
A big article! Look,
one of them's me.

04:52.514 --> 04:53.491
That is you.

04:53.515 --> 04:55.785
Hey, you're quoted in here.
When did you talk to this guy?

04:55.809 --> 04:59.112
A man asked me some questions
at the competition last month,

04:59.646 --> 05:00.989
but I didn't think that he'd...

05:01.648 --> 05:04.961
Get this, "Claudia Salinger's
sophisticated interpretations

05:04.985 --> 05:07.505
place her in a league of musicians
at least twice her age."

05:07.529 --> 05:09.132
- Wow.
-  -That's really cool, Claud.

05:09.156 --> 05:11.259
You should cut it out and
put it on the fridge.

05:11.283 --> 05:13.094
I never really thought
of myself as a star.

05:13.118 --> 05:14.679
I'm outta here. Wish me luck.

05:14.703 --> 05:16.046
Good luck!

05:17.414 --> 05:20.008
Oh, I don't think this
picture's on my good side.

05:21.084 --> 05:23.470
- Do you? -Up with the
roosters again, hey, Jule?

05:23.545 --> 05:25.356
There's a very
loud lady upstairs

05:25.380 --> 05:26.441
teaching Owen the mambo.

05:26.465 --> 05:28.067
Yeah, you'd better get dressed.
We gotta leave soon.

05:28.091 --> 05:30.653
Don't worry, Bay, I'll get
there myself eventually.

05:30.677 --> 05:32.020
"Gifted."

05:32.137 --> 05:33.980
That's like special, right?

05:41.563 --> 05:43.240
Ah, a sleigh bed.

05:43.565 --> 05:44.699
Hmm.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.620
It's a beautiful
design, Charlie.

05:49.071 --> 05:51.081
Thank you. Thanks.

05:51.657 --> 05:52.759
But I've gotta be
honest with you,

05:52.783 --> 05:54.260
you're gonna maybe break
even on this deal,

05:54.284 --> 05:56.253
and you're still a few
hundred above my other guys.

05:57.037 --> 05:58.213
- Still?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:58.288 --> 05:59.349
Look, it's not your fault.

05:59.373 --> 06:02.259
These guys, they've been working
in the area 20, 25 years.

06:02.334 --> 06:03.227
The prices they can get...

06:03.251 --> 06:04.437
Fine. Cut it in half.

06:04.461 --> 06:06.471
- Excuse me? -The price.
I'll do it for half.

06:09.299 --> 06:10.517
You'll take a loss.

06:11.259 --> 06:12.769
That's my choice.

06:13.804 --> 06:15.146
Half, huh?

06:19.893 --> 06:21.403
Still have it by Saturday?

06:21.436 --> 06:22.696
Absolutely.

06:25.023 --> 06:26.658
I want this job, sir.

06:45.502 --> 06:46.980
That, that's good, Claudia,

06:47.004 --> 06:49.273
but try to get a little gentler.

06:49.297 --> 06:51.599
You know, it's a, it's
a delicate piece.

06:55.345 --> 06:57.230
No, come on. Ease up on it.

06:57.472 --> 06:58.732
I don't know, Ross,

06:59.099 --> 07:00.827
I think it's more
interesting this way.

07:00.851 --> 07:02.610
Or louder, anyway.

07:04.104 --> 07:06.874
Listen, it, it's
supposed to be soft.

07:06.898 --> 07:09.502
Think of it like a secret.

07:09.526 --> 07:11.045
You're whispering to someone.

07:11.069 --> 07:13.371
All right.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.216
But that's not how I feel it.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.094
Well, maybe if you
try it my way,

07:18.118 --> 07:19.753
you'll like the way it feels.

07:21.872 --> 07:25.008
Ross, I am one of the most
promising youths in the Bay area.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.177
I think my opinion should
count for something.

07:28.587 --> 07:29.846
Don't you?

07:40.849 --> 07:42.025
Hello?

07:43.185 --> 07:44.569
Yeah, this is Charlie.

07:45.937 --> 07:47.197
Oh, yeah. Hi.

07:49.483 --> 07:51.117
Julia's absence this morning?

07:52.319 --> 07:54.088
Right, uh, let's see, um...

07:54.112 --> 07:55.372
What's today?

07:57.074 --> 07:57.967
Right.

07:57.991 --> 07:59.552
She did have a doctor's
appointment this morning.

07:59.576 --> 08:00.919
She saw her, um...

08:01.203 --> 08:02.420
Her dentist.

08:03.872 --> 08:05.757
Right. I mean, her allergist.

08:06.958 --> 08:08.227
Okay.

08:08.251 --> 08:09.469
Thanks for checking in.

08:09.586 --> 08:11.012
Bye.

08:12.506 --> 08:13.890
Julia!

08:16.093 --> 08:17.153
Allergies?

08:17.177 --> 08:19.030
What are you, stupid?
They never buy allergies!

08:19.054 --> 08:21.449
Why didn't you just announce you
were cutting, for God's sake?

08:21.473 --> 08:22.658
Why, did someone call?

08:22.682 --> 08:24.869
Did you go to school at all, or you
just hanging around at home all day?

08:24.893 --> 08:26.204
No, I was just a little late.
Who called?

08:26.228 --> 08:27.830
Your writing teacher. I
looked like an idiot.

08:27.854 --> 08:29.415
Oh, Charlie, call him back.
And tell him...

08:29.439 --> 08:30.958
Call him back and
tell him that...

08:30.982 --> 08:32.418
You actually think I'm
going to cover for you

08:32.442 --> 08:34.327
so you can stay out all
night at that club?

08:34.528 --> 08:35.462
Forget it, Julia!

08:35.486 --> 08:36.756
Come on, Charlie, please?

08:36.780 --> 08:38.383
I'll give you his number.
It'll take two seconds.

08:38.407 --> 08:39.624
No!

08:39.698 --> 08:41.219
And since when do you
blow off writing, anyway?

08:41.243 --> 08:43.136
I thought that was the only
reason you still went to school.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.347
It was first period. I just...

08:44.371 --> 08:47.266
Look, Charlie, Mr. McQuilkin is
real serious about attendance.

08:47.290 --> 08:50.009
If you don't help me out, I'm
gonna be in big trouble here.

08:50.252 --> 08:51.636
Maybe that's what you need.

08:53.964 --> 08:55.223
Okay...

08:55.549 --> 08:56.850
I got her this.

08:57.175 --> 08:59.394
Warm, cozy, perfect for a mom.

08:59.761 --> 09:02.240
Then I thought, you
know, the big 40.

09:02.264 --> 09:04.232
Remind her she's still young.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.120
But I don't know, Maybe
a surprise party's

09:07.144 --> 09:09.455
all the shock she can
handle in one evening.

09:09.479 --> 09:10.739
What do you think?

09:11.606 --> 09:13.334
I think you should give
your mom the bathrobe

09:13.358 --> 09:15.702
and keep this thing for us.

09:16.778 --> 09:18.037
For you, I mean.

09:20.449 --> 09:22.083
All right, well, what
am I going to get her?

09:22.242 --> 09:23.719
You don't have to
get her anything.

09:23.743 --> 09:25.555
Swinging the restaurant
for the party was plenty.

09:25.579 --> 09:28.381
Yeah, I know, I know, but
I want to impress her.

09:28.623 --> 09:31.018
You know, I want her to say,
"yeah, I liked him before,

09:31.042 --> 09:32.270
but now that he's
given me The Clapper,

09:32.294 --> 09:34.387
I'm sure he's the
right guy for Kate."

09:34.754 --> 09:36.389
She knows you're the
right guy for me.

09:36.798 --> 09:39.017
Oh, yeah, how does
she know that?

09:39.301 --> 09:40.643
I told her.

09:51.313 --> 09:53.072
So let me ask you a question.

09:53.148 --> 09:54.491
What?

09:55.525 --> 09:56.868
Uh, last night...

09:58.069 --> 09:59.046
I didn't mean to push.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.006
No, you didn't.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.956
Because I want you to know that,

10:02.407 --> 10:03.833
that if you're not ready,

10:04.326 --> 10:05.835
then I can wait.

10:06.161 --> 10:07.545
Good.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.183
Not forever or anything.

10:10.207 --> 10:12.310
I mean, you're
pretty irresistible.

10:12.334 --> 10:13.227
Bailey...

10:13.251 --> 10:15.428
But it's okay. I'll resist...

10:16.129 --> 10:17.347
...a while.

10:19.716 --> 10:21.935
Listen, I should
tell you something.

10:22.219 --> 10:23.520
Tell me anything.

10:23.762 --> 10:26.564
It's about this, about
sleeping together.

10:27.516 --> 10:28.900
My new favorite subject.

10:30.435 --> 10:31.861
The thing is, Bailey...

10:33.313 --> 10:35.281
I don't think that's something
I'm gonna wanna do.

10:37.234 --> 10:40.370
You mean, like, not now,
or, like, not soon?

10:42.113 --> 10:43.331
I mean, like...

10:43.907 --> 10:45.124
Not ever.

10:46.618 --> 10:47.877
What?

10:49.913 --> 10:51.214
Are you serious?

10:51.915 --> 10:53.216
Yeah.

10:55.627 --> 10:58.189
What, did, did I,
did I do something?

10:58.213 --> 10:59.514
Because I thought we were...

11:00.006 --> 11:01.192
I mean, I thought you felt...

11:01.216 --> 11:02.767
It's, it's not you.

11:03.301 --> 11:04.853
It's just...

11:05.136 --> 11:06.364
I've thought a lot about this.

11:06.388 --> 11:07.782
No. Yeah. Of course you have.

11:07.806 --> 11:10.910
I know it sounds really
queer and old-fashioned,

11:10.934 --> 11:13.204
but when I decide

11:13.228 --> 11:15.248
to spend the rest of
my life with someone,

11:15.272 --> 11:17.323
when I make that
kind of commitment,

11:17.774 --> 11:20.285
I want to be able to say to him,
"Yeah, I've dated other guys,

11:21.069 --> 11:22.672
but I've only done
this with you."

11:22.696 --> 11:24.163
So let's get married, then.

11:25.824 --> 11:29.877
- Bailey... -Or, or engaged,
at least, and then...

11:30.495 --> 11:32.265
You could give me an advance,

11:32.289 --> 11:34.424
you know, kind of like
a low-interest loan.

11:37.002 --> 11:39.012
I'm, I'm sorry.
Um, this isn't...

11:41.589 --> 11:43.016
You're not laughing.

11:45.677 --> 11:47.270
You understand, don't you?

11:48.346 --> 11:49.647
Yeah.

11:51.016 --> 11:52.317
Yes.

11:53.226 --> 11:54.652
Yeah, I understand.

12:10.952 --> 12:12.128
Hey...

12:12.662 --> 12:14.130
Why aren't you at school?

12:14.873 --> 12:17.216
I don't need school as
much as the other kids,

12:17.959 --> 12:19.020
you know, the not-gifted ones?

12:19.044 --> 12:21.012
Get dressed now.
I'm not kidding...

12:21.796 --> 12:23.097
Where's Mona?

12:30.055 --> 12:31.939
I said off, Claudia!

12:32.724 --> 12:33.941
You're late!

12:35.018 --> 12:36.152
For what?

12:37.062 --> 12:39.155
I'm sorry, Ross. I thought...

12:39.356 --> 12:40.573
Forget it.

12:40.607 --> 12:41.792
What's up?

12:41.816 --> 12:43.785
I got a call about Claudia.

12:44.319 --> 12:46.255
The Bay area chamber
ensemble wants to know

12:46.279 --> 12:49.207
if she could sub for a
soloist on Saturday.

12:49.783 --> 12:51.376
It's a nice opportunity,

12:51.701 --> 12:53.544
but I figured I should
run it by you first.

12:54.329 --> 12:55.723
Well, anything that'll
get her out of my hair

12:55.747 --> 12:57.298
is completely cool with me.

12:59.042 --> 13:00.343
What are they paying?

13:00.585 --> 13:02.720
Nothing, Claudia.
It's a benefit.

13:04.589 --> 13:06.641
All right. I'll do it,

13:07.258 --> 13:08.559
but no offense, Ross,

13:08.676 --> 13:10.645
I really think I
need a new agent.

13:12.514 --> 13:13.991
And after the concert,

13:14.015 --> 13:15.868
if you feel like dumping
her off the Bay Bridge,

13:15.892 --> 13:17.819
that'd be completely
cool with me too.

13:20.855 --> 13:22.458
And right when I'm about
to tell her best friend

13:22.482 --> 13:25.284
when to be at Salinger's,
Mom picks up the extension,

13:25.318 --> 13:26.545
but I don't think she heard.

13:26.569 --> 13:28.705
I think she'll still
be surprised.

13:31.241 --> 13:33.803
And then the aliens
returned me to Earth

13:33.827 --> 13:35.471
to deliver their
message to my leader.

13:35.495 --> 13:36.764
Jeez, Kate, I just
can't figure out

13:36.788 --> 13:38.381
how you cannot want
to sleep with me.

13:38.832 --> 13:39.767
Excuse me?

13:39.791 --> 13:42.436
I mean, I heard what you said and all.
I did. It's just...

13:42.460 --> 13:43.854
I thought you were
okay with this.

13:43.878 --> 13:46.107
So did I, then I
got to thinking,

13:46.131 --> 13:48.692
it just seemed wrong
or something.

13:48.716 --> 13:51.028
I'm not saying it's never
ever gonna happen.

13:51.052 --> 13:53.354
It's just not now.

13:53.513 --> 13:54.865
Not how we are now.

13:54.889 --> 13:57.400
What, completely crazy
about each other?

13:57.475 --> 13:58.994
You're right, that'd
be a big mistake.

13:59.018 --> 14:00.579
Look, I just don't want
to be one of those people

14:00.603 --> 14:02.623
who just throw it away
like it was nothing.

14:02.647 --> 14:03.916
I know, but...

14:03.940 --> 14:05.709
Like my mom when
she got divorced.

14:05.733 --> 14:08.661
She'd go out with a guy, and she'd
like him, so she'd sleep with him,

14:08.695 --> 14:10.172
and then a couple months
later, he'd be gone,

14:10.196 --> 14:12.415
and then the same thing would
happen with someone else.

14:12.574 --> 14:16.127
I mean, my God, after a while, it
stops meaning anything at all.

14:18.204 --> 14:20.047
I promise it would
mean something.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.260
Are you mad?

14:24.461 --> 14:26.596
No. I'm not mad.

14:27.005 --> 14:28.065
Well, you're something.

14:28.089 --> 14:30.099
No. I'm not anything.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.158
Where did you take these?

14:37.182 --> 14:38.816
The weight room.

14:39.058 --> 14:40.985
You look at that guy, You
tell me that's not art.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.955
Nina, it's exploitation.

14:42.979 --> 14:44.248
Oh, well.

14:44.272 --> 14:45.782
Hey, I'm not done.

14:48.401 --> 14:49.869
Julia.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.205
Oh, damn. Don't leave, okay?

14:52.489 --> 14:54.415
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:54.741 --> 14:56.459
Nina, could you
give us a minute?

14:56.618 --> 14:58.586
Sure. Okay.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.009
I've missed you in class.

15:05.043 --> 15:06.353
Yeah, I've had doctor's...

15:06.377 --> 15:07.887
Wrong answer.

15:07.921 --> 15:09.231
Your brother already
blew it on the phone.

15:09.255 --> 15:11.140
You guys gotta get
your stories straight.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.528
Listen, Julia, you
look exhausted.

15:14.552 --> 15:15.770
What's going on?

15:15.804 --> 15:17.865
Nothing. I just haven't
made class, that's all.

15:17.889 --> 15:19.941
Oh. Yeah, well...

15:20.475 --> 15:23.277
Funny thing about my class.
It ain't optional.

15:23.978 --> 15:24.955
I'll make up the work.

15:24.979 --> 15:26.656
You're darn right you will.

15:27.106 --> 15:29.826
Julia, you're one of the best
writers I've ever taught,

15:30.735 --> 15:33.663
and you used to love my class,
I gotta do something, here.

15:34.739 --> 15:35.998
Like what?

15:36.366 --> 15:38.000
I'm supposed to
give you detention,

15:38.618 --> 15:39.877
but...

15:40.203 --> 15:42.380
I think that's a waste
of everybody's time,

15:42.997 --> 15:45.842
so I've made you an appointment
with the school therapist instead.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.977
What? Why?

15:47.001 --> 15:50.189
Because, Julia, you're
not the same person

15:50.213 --> 15:53.057
who's been in my class
the last two years.

15:53.424 --> 15:55.434
I miss that person.

15:56.886 --> 15:59.814
I can't just sit back and let
you disappear without a fight.

16:02.392 --> 16:03.860
You miss Kirsten, don't you?

16:04.686 --> 16:06.038
Well, maybe if you'd
behaved yourself,

16:06.062 --> 16:08.040
if you hadn't cheated
on her and lied to her,

16:08.064 --> 16:10.000
then we, maybe, wouldn't
be in this fix.

16:10.024 --> 16:11.742
You'd have somebody
to take care of you,

16:12.068 --> 16:13.661
and I'd be able to
work on the bed.

16:14.946 --> 16:16.539
Oh, thank God.

16:17.574 --> 16:20.010
Look, Mona, in the future, you're
really gonna have to let me know

16:20.034 --> 16:21.502
if you're gonna be
late like this.

16:21.536 --> 16:22.596
I mean, I've got stuff to do,

16:22.620 --> 16:25.590
and if I can't count on
you to be here, I mean...

16:25.915 --> 16:27.309
I mean, if you need the
time, I understand,

16:27.333 --> 16:29.343
but you just really
gotta call first, or...

16:31.045 --> 16:32.263
What is that smell?

16:33.006 --> 16:34.307
Excuse me?

16:35.425 --> 16:36.652
You've been drinking.

16:36.676 --> 16:38.946
Well, maybe just one.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.104
One?

16:40.889 --> 16:42.481
Lady, you smell
like Oktoberfest.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.744
You're drunk! It's 11
o'clock in the morning.

16:45.768 --> 16:47.195
What the hell are you thinking?

16:48.021 --> 16:50.072
I think you're overreacting.

16:50.398 --> 16:51.532
What?

16:51.691 --> 16:53.117
Hey, you're his nanny.

16:53.651 --> 16:55.296
That means I'm trusting
you with his life.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.955
I mean, God, you gotta, you
gotta bathe him. You have to...

16:59.198 --> 17:02.084
Just forget it. I don't have time to argue.
Just get out.

17:03.411 --> 17:04.670
Now!

17:05.329 --> 17:08.349
Do I have to be here? I
mean, is this required?

17:08.374 --> 17:10.760
No. Absolutely not.

17:10.877 --> 17:12.688
Mr. McQuilkin just
figured it'd be easier

17:12.712 --> 17:14.931
than getting the
administration involved.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.973
Because I'm not crazy about it.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.611
Fair enough.

17:18.635 --> 17:19.778
Is that my file?

17:19.801 --> 17:21.229
Mmm-hmm.

17:21.554 --> 17:23.564
Straight As for three
straight years,

17:23.890 --> 17:28.236
then, suddenly, we start
seeing some Bs, couple of Cs.

17:28.269 --> 17:29.455
Those are passing grades.

17:29.479 --> 17:31.332
Unexcused absences.

17:31.356 --> 17:32.791
Lots of kid cut class.

17:32.815 --> 17:34.492
You're not lots of kids, Julia.

17:36.194 --> 17:40.665
Look, I want to talk about how the
last few months have been for you.

17:41.866 --> 17:43.251
They've been really great.

17:43.326 --> 17:44.543
Thanks.

17:46.621 --> 17:48.047
Listen,

17:48.414 --> 17:52.218
when you and I talked right
after your parents' accident,

17:52.794 --> 17:54.355
we talked about
some of the things

17:54.379 --> 17:56.055
that you could expect to feel.

17:56.506 --> 17:58.307
I'm looking at your record here,

17:59.008 --> 18:01.143
and I'm seeing someone
who's really angry,

18:01.761 --> 18:04.198
and pulling away hard
from all the things

18:04.222 --> 18:06.565
that used to really
matter to her.

18:08.267 --> 18:09.443
So,

18:10.019 --> 18:13.572
listen, what I'd like to
do, if it's okay with you,

18:13.648 --> 18:17.243
is set up a time for you and me
to talk about those feelings.

18:18.778 --> 18:20.297
Maybe if we explore it a little,

18:20.321 --> 18:23.008
we can help you find some
enthusiasm for those things

18:23.032 --> 18:25.209
that used to really
mean a lot to you.

18:26.244 --> 18:27.712
How does that sound to you?

18:28.287 --> 18:30.391
You said this was
optional, right?

18:30.415 --> 18:32.008
Yup.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.718
Great.

18:50.268 --> 18:51.527
Owen...

18:57.025 --> 19:00.202
Does brilliant
have one L or two?

19:00.403 --> 19:01.954
Two, I'm pretty sure.

19:04.490 --> 19:05.718
Take care of Owen, will you?

19:05.742 --> 19:07.501
Can't. I'm busy.

19:07.660 --> 19:08.878
Doing what?

19:08.911 --> 19:10.472
My bio for the program.

19:10.496 --> 19:13.017
Look, Claudia, this job is really
important, and I'm way behind.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.227
If I do nothing but work and
sleep for the next couple days,

19:15.251 --> 19:16.427
I'll be fine,

19:16.586 --> 19:18.804
but I can't work and watch
him at the same time,

19:19.088 --> 19:21.275
and with Mona gone, there's no
one else to look after him.

19:21.299 --> 19:23.193
Well, I guess we'll be
a little more careful

19:23.217 --> 19:25.603
when we hire the next
nanny, won't we?

19:25.887 --> 19:27.156
Claudia!

19:27.180 --> 19:28.981
How do you spell "foremost?"

19:35.271 --> 19:36.697
What are we listening to?

19:37.023 --> 19:39.200
Um, I don't even know.

19:40.276 --> 19:41.786
One of those days, huh?

19:44.197 --> 19:45.664
All right, well, tell
me all about it.

19:45.698 --> 19:47.342
Alarm goes off, you
roll out of bed...

19:47.366 --> 19:49.553
You know, Danny, the one thing
I love most about this place

19:49.577 --> 19:51.754
is no one ever asks me any
questions around here.

19:52.622 --> 19:53.964
Got you.

19:54.165 --> 19:56.217
You had a bad day. We'll
leave it at that.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.761
Oh, I brought you something.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.727
"Most like me."

20:07.428 --> 20:08.405
It's a poem.

20:08.429 --> 20:09.772
Thanks for the tip.

20:11.099 --> 20:13.776
It's about my little brother
I wrote it when he was born.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.945
Anyways, I thought the
meter might work.

20:16.229 --> 20:18.697
You don't have to read it.
It's too embarrassing.

20:18.981 --> 20:20.991
- I'm serious.
- Mmm.

20:23.444 --> 20:24.797
You don't have to use it.

20:24.821 --> 20:26.330
Of course I'll use it.

20:26.864 --> 20:27.998
It's great.

20:28.783 --> 20:29.968
I mean, I won't be
hurt if you don't.

20:29.992 --> 20:32.002
Hey, will you shut up?
It's perfect.

20:33.121 --> 20:35.131
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.634
Watch.

20:39.085 --> 20:41.387
<i>♪ Came home today ♪</i>

20:41.754 --> 20:44.557
<i>♪ Wrapped up real tight ♪</i>

20:56.060 --> 20:57.653
Oh, man.

21:52.074 --> 21:53.417
What are you doing?

21:53.951 --> 21:55.929
I, uh, I've still got a
lot of homework left,

21:55.953 --> 21:58.881
so maybe we should watch
the rest of this later.

21:59.832 --> 22:01.091
Are you sure?

22:01.375 --> 22:02.885
Yeah, I think.

22:03.502 --> 22:04.720
Yeah.

22:05.546 --> 22:06.523
Okay.

22:06.547 --> 22:08.516
So we'll watch the rest later.

22:10.051 --> 22:11.227
Okay.

22:18.476 --> 22:20.287
Claudia, get out here now.

22:20.311 --> 22:22.497
Julia, I have a
performance tomorrow.

22:22.521 --> 22:23.822
I need my rest.

22:23.856 --> 22:26.700
And Thurber needs his walk, which
it was your turn to give him.

22:28.903 --> 22:30.130
Who says I didn't?

22:30.154 --> 22:32.257
A poop in the middle of the
living room floor, that's who.

22:32.281 --> 22:34.092
Now, get out here and
clean it up now!

22:34.116 --> 22:35.385
What are you, nuts?

22:35.409 --> 22:37.378
Poop is nothing but bacteria.

22:37.954 --> 22:39.890
I've got a performance
tomorrow, I can't afford...

22:39.914 --> 22:41.850
I don't care if you're playing
for the president tomorrow.

22:41.874 --> 22:42.851
Get out here.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.468
- No.
- Charlie.

22:44.585 --> 22:45.479
What's going on?

22:45.503 --> 22:47.680
Poop in the living room.
It was Claudia's turn.

22:47.797 --> 22:49.181
There's poop in the...

22:49.340 --> 22:51.392
Oh, gross. Clean it up, Claud.

22:51.801 --> 22:53.269
This better be life and death.

22:53.511 --> 22:54.529
There's poop in the living room.

22:54.553 --> 22:55.489
Claudia.

22:55.513 --> 22:57.523
It's not my poop.
It's Thurber's.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.234
Claudia, clean it up
and walk the dog.

23:00.476 --> 23:02.245
You guys, if Thurber runs
while I'm walking him

23:02.269 --> 23:04.238
and the tension on the
leash strains a muscle,

23:05.272 --> 23:06.865
it's not just me who suffers.

23:07.817 --> 23:08.951
It's my public.

23:10.653 --> 23:12.547
I owe it to my fans
to stay healthy.

23:12.571 --> 23:14.091
You don't have any
fans, Claudia.

23:14.115 --> 23:15.258
You have one.

23:15.282 --> 23:16.843
One tone-deaf idiot
at <i>The Examiner</i>

23:16.867 --> 23:18.210
who thought you were cute.

23:19.453 --> 23:20.629
You know, guys,

23:21.247 --> 23:23.266
jealousy is very unbecoming.

23:23.290 --> 23:24.842
Okay, Claudia, that's it.

23:25.251 --> 23:26.478
I'm not kidding.

23:26.502 --> 23:27.813
If you wanna be a
part of this family,

23:27.837 --> 23:30.691
you're getting out here right
now and cleaning up the poop.

23:30.715 --> 23:32.651
And washing the dishes,
and sitting for Owen.

23:32.675 --> 23:34.310
Otherwise, you're out.

23:36.595 --> 23:38.022
If it's the media,

23:38.347 --> 23:39.732
take a message.

23:44.770 --> 23:46.613
If it's any consolation,
I was scared.

23:50.818 --> 23:52.077
Hello?

23:52.737 --> 23:54.381
You know your job better
than I do, ma'am,

23:54.405 --> 23:57.759
but isn't six detentions a
little stiff for one cut?

23:57.783 --> 23:59.251
One?

23:59.326 --> 24:03.339
Charlie, Julia has been truant six
times in the last three weeks.

24:03.372 --> 24:06.300
Every time, she brought a note
claiming it was from you,

24:06.584 --> 24:08.344
and it isn't just the cuts.

24:08.919 --> 24:11.064
You must have noticed
a change in her,

24:11.088 --> 24:14.558
her attitude, her priorities,
her choice of friends.

24:15.843 --> 24:18.071
Are you kids seeing someone,

24:18.095 --> 24:21.440
a therapist, someone,
as a family?

24:21.724 --> 24:23.359
We did, but now we just

24:23.893 --> 24:25.287
kind of deal with these
things ourselves.

24:25.311 --> 24:26.612
Do you?

24:27.104 --> 24:28.655
Do you talk to each other?

24:29.148 --> 24:30.616
Yes, of course.

24:30.858 --> 24:32.242
About the accident?

24:32.818 --> 24:34.787
About what you're
all going through?

24:35.905 --> 24:39.208
You know, Charlie, these
things won't solve themselves.

24:39.825 --> 24:40.802
If you need help...

24:40.826 --> 24:42.127
I can handle it.

24:42.745 --> 24:47.091
I mean, if things are falling
apart, tell us. We'll help out.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.426
Nothing's falling apart, ma'am.

24:49.794 --> 24:52.513
Julia messed up. You told me about it.
I'll take care of it.

24:53.255 --> 24:55.150
Because there are
outside organizations...

24:55.174 --> 24:56.642
I said I can handle it.

24:59.887 --> 25:02.115
Oh!

25:02.139 --> 25:03.283
What is it?

25:03.307 --> 25:06.620
Well, it's the catalog from
the Annette Langston exhibit.

25:06.644 --> 25:09.915
I adored this show.
How did you know?

25:09.939 --> 25:12.959
I saw a picture of hers in your
gallery, so I figured you liked her.

25:12.983 --> 25:15.962
I think she is fantastic.

25:15.986 --> 25:17.881
This is so thoughtful
of you, Bailey.

25:17.905 --> 25:19.508
Thank you so much.

25:19.532 --> 25:20.874
You're welcome.

25:21.117 --> 25:22.501
Score.

25:26.247 --> 25:27.641
You know what you want?

25:27.665 --> 25:31.520
Yeah. Her, alone with
me, my bed, buck naked.

25:31.544 --> 25:33.063
Or do you need a
little more time?

25:33.087 --> 25:35.107
Oh, no, no, no. I'll,
I'll have a Coke.

25:35.131 --> 25:38.693
Katie, how did you pull all
this off without my knowing?

25:38.717 --> 25:40.686
It was easy. You're oblivious.

25:42.513 --> 25:43.615
Don't let her make light of it.

25:43.639 --> 25:44.866
She worked on this for weeks.

25:44.890 --> 25:46.952
Yeah, but Bailey did
all the hard stuff.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.579
Oh, Bailey, on top of this gift?

25:49.603 --> 25:51.164
How can I ever thank you?

25:51.188 --> 25:54.000
Well, since you asked, you could
tell your lovely young daughter

25:54.024 --> 25:56.160
to throw away all her
moral and ethical beliefs

25:56.193 --> 25:58.912
in the interest of satisfying
my base, carnal desires.

26:00.156 --> 26:02.425
It was nothing. Really.
I was happy to do it.

26:02.449 --> 26:04.136
Okay, I'm going to get
mushy here, for a second.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.137
Oh, God.

26:05.161 --> 26:06.879
Well, I am.

26:07.454 --> 26:11.550
I want to say to you, Bailey, and,
well, to everyone, I suppose,

26:11.709 --> 26:14.803
how happy it makes me to
see you two kids together.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.941
I couldn't have dreamed
up a nicer beau...

26:17.965 --> 26:20.026
Mom, that's such a stupid word.

26:20.050 --> 26:23.363
Oh, all right, a
boyfriend, whatever.

26:23.387 --> 26:25.981
A nicer guy for my Katie.

26:26.432 --> 26:28.317
Can I get anyone anything else?

26:28.726 --> 26:32.654
Yeah, may as well throw in some
sex toys, some whipped cream,

26:32.688 --> 26:35.782
what the heck, handcuffs.
Use your imagination.

26:36.734 --> 26:40.412
He is an absolute saint.

27:05.512 --> 27:07.064
I'm making tea.

27:07.306 --> 27:08.690
You want some?

27:09.934 --> 27:11.235
Listen, Jule,

27:11.685 --> 27:13.028
I've been thinking.

27:14.855 --> 27:17.324
I don't know what I'm doing
around here half the time,

27:17.691 --> 27:18.867
and...

27:19.485 --> 27:21.203
Maybe I've been
doing this wrong.

27:21.278 --> 27:25.249
You know, I mean, all this time, I've been
worried about what you've been up to,

27:25.491 --> 27:27.626
going out to clubs and all that.

27:28.494 --> 27:31.505
But, you know, maybe I should've
been thinking about why.

27:32.831 --> 27:34.383
Come on, Charlie.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.677
Because I have no idea
what you're thinking

27:37.253 --> 27:38.679
or, you know,

27:39.713 --> 27:40.931
feeling,

27:42.508 --> 27:44.017
about Mom and Dad.

27:45.970 --> 27:47.854
I'm not feeling anything.

27:52.643 --> 27:53.995
Look, Jule, I know
how hard it is

27:54.019 --> 27:55.737
to talk to other people
about all this...

27:59.066 --> 28:01.243
But you could talk to me.

28:04.488 --> 28:05.956
Why do we have to do this?

28:06.865 --> 28:08.292
You know, Charlie,

28:09.076 --> 28:11.587
I'm so tired of
every single person

28:12.246 --> 28:15.100
every single minute
of every single day

28:15.124 --> 28:17.301
looking at me and wondering
how I'm feeling.

28:17.835 --> 28:19.428
Everyone's just concerned.

28:20.170 --> 28:21.388
I know,

28:22.339 --> 28:24.651
and I know they'd all like me
to be the way I was before,

28:24.675 --> 28:26.893
'cause then it would make
them feel like I'm okay,

28:28.470 --> 28:30.814
but being that way doesn't
make me feel okay.

28:32.016 --> 28:33.994
So why is it such a crime
that I do some things

28:34.018 --> 28:35.287
that actually make
me feel better?

28:35.311 --> 28:37.029
I mean, why is that so bad?

28:39.189 --> 28:40.574
I don't know, Jule.

28:43.861 --> 28:45.287
I don't want to be a drag.

28:47.865 --> 28:51.501
So I won't cut classes anymore
and I won't fail out of school,

28:52.453 --> 28:54.421
but, Charlie, that's
all I can promise you.

28:54.455 --> 28:57.633
You know, 'cause I've
found a couple of places

28:57.916 --> 28:59.718
where people don't
look at me funny,

29:00.878 --> 29:02.888
so I want to keep going there,

29:03.631 --> 29:05.807
'cause I feel like a
real person there,

29:07.635 --> 29:10.145
and that feels so good to
me, I can't even tell you.

29:15.059 --> 29:17.611
32, 34, 36...

29:18.562 --> 29:19.863
So four more.

29:20.022 --> 29:21.239
I can add.

29:21.273 --> 29:23.209
Sorry. I thought I
was being helpful.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.993
Yeah, well, I'm not an idiot.

29:25.402 --> 29:26.838
Fine. Good for you.

29:26.862 --> 29:28.163
There.

29:28.906 --> 29:30.666
One to grow on.

29:34.745 --> 29:35.764
Why are you doing this?

29:35.788 --> 29:36.922
I'm not doing anything.

29:37.581 --> 29:39.976
You're the one who made this totally
arbitrary decision about us

29:40.000 --> 29:41.895
without even asking me
how I felt about it.

29:41.919 --> 29:44.439
I need your permission
not to sleep with you?

29:44.463 --> 29:45.732
You don't have to
put it that way.

29:45.756 --> 29:47.317
You can put it however
you want, Bailey,

29:47.341 --> 29:49.444
but it all boils down
to the same thing.

29:49.468 --> 29:51.561
You punishing me for not
giving you what you want.

29:51.595 --> 29:54.064
That is not true That
is not what I'm saying.

29:54.556 --> 29:57.494
Don't make this sound like this is
just about me wanting to get laid,

29:57.518 --> 29:59.903
because it's not,
Kate, it's about us.

30:00.729 --> 30:02.072
I want...

30:02.231 --> 30:03.750
I really want to
make love with you,

30:03.774 --> 30:08.036
and, and I totally understand
"not ready," or "not yet."

30:08.862 --> 30:10.298
I understand, "let's
give it some time."

30:10.322 --> 30:13.510
I could give you so much time, but
you're not asking me for time.

30:13.534 --> 30:16.044
You're asking me just to
forget about it, and that...

30:17.538 --> 30:18.515
...that changes everything.

30:18.539 --> 30:19.756
Why?

30:20.165 --> 30:22.936
Why does everything suddenly
hinge on this one issue?

30:22.960 --> 30:25.563
A week ago, we weren't sleeping
together, and you were perfectly happy.

30:25.587 --> 30:27.931
A week ago, we were
heading somewhere.

30:28.298 --> 30:29.818
Everything was going to
get better and better

30:29.842 --> 30:31.486
and more and more, and
all that, and now...

30:31.510 --> 30:33.770
- What, now?
- Now? Now there's a wall.

30:34.054 --> 30:35.907
You've, like, drawn a line
at sleeping together,

30:35.931 --> 30:37.617
and, I don't know,
maybe I'm crazy, Kate,

30:37.641 --> 30:39.369
but I don't think
I'm the only person

30:39.393 --> 30:41.111
who thinks that that's
part of being together.

30:41.228 --> 30:42.821
What, so that's what
this is to you?

30:43.272 --> 30:44.958
The only reason we're
together is to have sex?

30:44.982 --> 30:47.659
No, it's not the only
reason, but it's important,

30:48.485 --> 30:51.089
and if I can't ever, I
mean, God, Kate, I'm 16.

30:51.113 --> 30:52.581
So am I.

30:55.409 --> 30:57.210
I guess that means
different things to us.

30:57.870 --> 30:59.171
I guess it does.

30:59.371 --> 31:01.506
Hey, there, you two.
Better hurry up.

31:01.623 --> 31:02.976
Getting antsy over there.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.802
We're coming. We're coming.

31:29.610 --> 31:32.370
I know it's late, and you need
a good night's sleep, but...

31:33.947 --> 31:35.499
I'm really desperate.

31:37.409 --> 31:39.262
I'll never hassle you
as long as I live

31:39.286 --> 31:41.171
if you'll just help
me out this once.

31:41.747 --> 31:45.175
It'll be fun. We'll all pitch in
and have, like, a sanding party.

31:45.626 --> 31:47.844
I really, really need your help.
What do you say?

31:49.213 --> 31:50.639
Sorry.

31:52.174 --> 31:53.475
Too risky.

31:57.387 --> 31:58.855
You know, you can't
buy love like that.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.233
Okay, ground rules,

32:01.600 --> 32:03.485
sand with the
grain, not against.

32:03.852 --> 32:06.905
Start with the coarsest paper,
work your way down to the finest.

32:07.022 --> 32:09.324
Water and bathroom break
every 45 minutes,

32:10.025 --> 32:11.451
and go!

32:37.302 --> 32:38.603
Hey, Char...

32:39.304 --> 32:41.940
You ever have trouble convincing
a girl to sleep with you?

32:46.186 --> 32:47.946
Not that I can remember.

32:48.689 --> 32:49.948
Didn't think so.

33:00.951 --> 33:02.127
Thanks.

33:03.370 --> 33:05.515
Hey, Jule, you know what
I was thinking about?

33:05.539 --> 33:06.882
What?

33:14.214 --> 33:15.891
Remember when I first moved out?

33:17.009 --> 33:18.768
I came home for dinner one night

33:19.261 --> 33:22.480
and bitched about the fact that the
only mail I ever got was bills,

33:23.891 --> 33:26.119
and for every week after
that for, like, six months,

33:26.143 --> 33:27.444
you'd send me a letter.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.654
I forgot about that.

33:30.314 --> 33:32.324
You were like, what, 12?

33:32.399 --> 33:33.783
Yeah, I guess.

33:34.443 --> 33:36.620
God, I can't even remember
what I put in them.

33:36.987 --> 33:40.081
They were these great stories
about what you were up to,

33:41.658 --> 33:43.543
only they were
completely made up.

33:43.869 --> 33:45.170
I remember one.

33:45.829 --> 33:49.216
You said you'd met up with this pack of
orangutans who took you to back to Africa

33:49.416 --> 33:52.552
and fed you peanut butter and honey
sandwiches and made you do the Lambada.

33:53.795 --> 33:55.472
How embarrassing.

33:55.547 --> 33:57.557
No, Jule, they were great,

33:59.009 --> 34:00.894
and they were really
you, you know?

34:01.970 --> 34:02.906
What do you mean?

34:02.930 --> 34:04.814
Making up stories, writing them,

34:06.058 --> 34:07.734
it comes so naturally to you.

34:09.353 --> 34:11.196
You're a really
good writer, Jule,

34:11.855 --> 34:13.031
and, look,

34:13.315 --> 34:15.824
I'm not the best
advice-giver or anything,

34:17.110 --> 34:19.829
but I really think whatever happens,
you shouldn't give up writing.

34:20.364 --> 34:24.042
I mean, if you want to not get
straight As, I can understand,

34:25.369 --> 34:27.420
but whatever you do, you
should write about it.

What are you doing?

35:59.337 --> 36:00.638
I wanna help.

36:01.882 --> 36:03.433
You'll hurt your hands.

36:03.759 --> 36:05.685
But, Charlie, you asked me.

36:05.886 --> 36:08.188
What was I thinking about,
a big star like you?

36:08.555 --> 36:10.315
Besides, an artist
needs her sleep.

36:10.390 --> 36:12.359
It's okay. I don't care.

36:13.185 --> 36:14.527
Go to bed, Claud.

36:14.728 --> 36:16.279
You owe it to your public.

36:26.615 --> 36:27.791
Too mean?

36:28.366 --> 36:29.667
Nah.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.315
Well, I've got one
question for you.

36:53.225 --> 36:54.327
What?

36:54.351 --> 36:56.069
What are you doing working
in that restaurant?

36:58.313 --> 36:59.624
Well, you know how it
is getting started.

36:59.648 --> 37:01.459
- Heck, yeah. -It's kind
of hard to make a living.

37:01.483 --> 37:02.992
Yeah, I know.

37:04.111 --> 37:06.339
Well, I'll see if we got
any more jobs like this.

37:06.363 --> 37:07.789
I'd like to help you out.

37:07.906 --> 37:09.332
I'd really appreciate it.

37:12.077 --> 37:13.753
Oh, uh, this is...

37:15.038 --> 37:17.257
We cut the price in half, sir.
This is too much.

37:17.541 --> 37:19.134
That's what it's worth.

37:19.417 --> 37:20.927
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:21.878 --> 37:22.855
Well, thanks.

37:22.879 --> 37:24.013
No problem.

37:25.090 --> 37:26.567
Listen, I'm headed down
to the office right now.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.935
Why don't you come down with me.
I'll introduce you around.

37:29.177 --> 37:30.478
Oh, um...

37:32.180 --> 37:35.567
Could I swing by tomorrow? It's just,
I got some place I need to be.

37:35.684 --> 37:36.985
Sure.

37:40.105 --> 37:44.075
Yesterday, she suggested we put our
business relationship down on paper,

37:44.109 --> 37:45.702
just in case.

37:46.111 --> 37:48.339
What does she think you're going to
do, sue her for half her earnings?

37:48.363 --> 37:49.507
I guess.

37:49.531 --> 37:51.300
She also asked me what I thought

37:51.324 --> 37:54.335
about her going just
by the name Claudia.

37:54.452 --> 37:56.681
You know, like Midori?

37:56.705 --> 37:58.298
- Or Cher?
- Yeah.

38:00.584 --> 38:01.801
Claudia.

38:02.294 --> 38:03.595
I'm Dan Barton.

38:03.753 --> 38:05.472
I wrote the article.
Did you see it?

38:05.547 --> 38:09.100
Listen, this was a wonderful
performance, really something.

38:09.134 --> 38:12.395
Well, now that it's official, how
does it feel to be a child prodigy?

38:15.682 --> 38:17.108
No comment.

38:25.859 --> 38:29.078
Hey, Claud... Hey, let
me carry that for you.

38:29.821 --> 38:31.048
Come on, why don't you get up.

38:31.072 --> 38:33.041
Let me give you a
ride outta here.

38:37.078 --> 38:38.713
Whoo!

39:00.227 --> 39:01.736
Should I come out?

39:02.354 --> 39:03.780
Maybe. Yeah.

39:19.829 --> 39:21.089
Are we breaking up?

39:21.665 --> 39:23.007
I don't know, are we?

39:26.169 --> 39:29.180
I think about it, and it
seems so crazy, but then...

39:29.589 --> 39:30.974
I see you,

39:31.049 --> 39:34.143
I don't know, do anything, put
your hair behind your ears

39:35.345 --> 39:37.480
or fiddle with your
necklace, and I just...

39:38.598 --> 39:40.275
God, Kate, I just think,

39:40.392 --> 39:42.610
why do I always have
to stop myself from...

39:43.979 --> 39:45.947
Why do I have to feel
so bad about this?

39:46.940 --> 39:48.408
How do you think I feel?

39:50.527 --> 39:52.161
Every time we're together,

39:53.488 --> 39:55.707
it's like I'm this huge
disappointment to you.

39:55.824 --> 39:57.917
I don't mean to make
you feel that way.

39:58.451 --> 39:59.752
Well, you do.

40:01.371 --> 40:04.299
I mean, God, suddenly this
is what everything is about.

40:06.126 --> 40:08.678
Every time we kiss,
it's there, this thing.

40:09.921 --> 40:11.055
A big "please."

40:12.048 --> 40:13.349
And then a big "no."

40:15.218 --> 40:16.894
It doesn't work for
either of us...

40:20.265 --> 40:21.691
Does it?

40:25.103 --> 40:26.446
I guess not.

40:32.152 --> 40:33.494
I'm going inside.
