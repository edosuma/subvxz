Now, if you would excuse me,

41:13.187 --> 41:17.189
I'd better be getting back
to 2166.

41:17.191 --> 41:21.894
I've been waiting so very long
to meet your family.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.194
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

41:23.196 --> 41:27.599
No! No!

41:27.601 --> 41:29.734
No!

41:32.908 --> 41:42.908
