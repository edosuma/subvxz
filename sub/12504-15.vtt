total dedication to the sport

24:52.221 --> 24:53.823
Yo, Pay-Pay!

24:55.264 --> 24:56.225
Care to take the edge off?

24:58.568 --> 25:00.600
Drinking on campus?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.271
Well, we could go
off campus,

25:02.271 --> 25:04.203
but then we'd be
breaking the rules.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.705
Look, I'll
talk to you later.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.877
Hold on.
Talk to me now.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.239
I just...

25:11.841 --> 25:13.783
...wanted to thank you
for the rose.

25:13.783 --> 25:15.184
That was really sweet.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.149
- [students laughing]
- Oh. Um...

25:20.149 --> 25:22.652
I didn't
send you a rose.

25:24.253 --> 25:27.597
Then... why did you
wink at me?

25:27.597 --> 25:29.729
Because I thought you
sent it to yourself,

25:29.729 --> 25:33.132
as a joke.
I'm sorry, just...

25:33.132 --> 25:36.205
Corny romantic gestures
just aren't my thing.

25:36.205 --> 25:38.207
No, I'm the one who's sorry

25:38.207 --> 25:41.110
for thinking you were capable
of making any gesture at all.

25:41.110 --> 25:44.273
Whoa. Why the attack, Mac?

25:44.273 --> 25:46.716
I think the reason you trash
everything and everyone

25:46.716 --> 25:49.148
is because you're afraid
if you believe in anything,

25:49.148 --> 25:53.122
if you actually admit you care,
you just might be disappointed.

25:53.122 --> 25:56.325
OK.
You want to go there?

25:56.325 --> 25:59.959
You committed your
whole life to gymnastics.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.261
You believed, you cared,

26:02.261 --> 26:04.794
you busted your ass
for years.

26:04.794 --> 26:09.799
And what did you get?
A gold medal? No.

26:11.140 --> 26:12.742
A back brace.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.747
You know what else I got?

26:17.747 --> 26:20.279
I got discipline,
self-respect.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.112
I learned how to have pride
in myself and my teammates.

26:23.112 --> 26:26.786
And I learned that
trying to be something
is a whole lot better

26:26.786 --> 26:28.187
than sitting on your butt

26:28.187 --> 26:29.859
and trying not to be
anything at all.

26:29.859 --> 26:33.893
Wow. What happened
to the invisible girl?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.065
She's coming back to life.

26:36.065 --> 26:38.127
And, by the way,

26:38.127 --> 26:42.171
Heather isn't the patron saint
of pointless, Ike. You are.

26:42.171 --> 26:44.974
[man] Checking upper level.
Happy hour?

26:46.335 --> 26:48.307
And it isn't even 5:00.

26:50.239 --> 26:52.712
Principal's office, now.

27:00.149 --> 27:02.221
The first time
you fall in love,

27:02.221 --> 27:04.353
it's natural to think
it's forever.

27:04.353 --> 27:08.698
You think he or she's
the one you want to lose
your virginity to.

27:09.899 --> 27:15.004
But the truth is, most
first-time loves don't last.

27:15.004 --> 27:18.007
The Bible tells us
that sex is sacred.

27:18.007 --> 27:20.339
God sees sex as
a wonderful thing.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.642
It's a gift to be shared
between husbands and wives.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.644
And that's what makes it
truly special,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.247
knowing you're sharing
your most intimate self

27:28.247 --> 27:30.249
with your true soulmate.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.252
Abstinence is a choice
that empowers you,

27:33.252 --> 27:35.985
supports self-respect,

27:35.985 --> 27:38.688
and statistically
ensures a more satisfying

27:38.688 --> 27:40.960
and stable marriage
in the future.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.163
You have chosen to do
something really exciting

27:44.163 --> 27:47.797
with your young lives,
so why put that at risk?

27:47.797 --> 27:49.939
The no-dating policy
here is a rule.

27:49.939 --> 27:53.943
But the wisdom of knowing
what you do today

27:53.943 --> 27:57.406
can affect you forever?
That's a blessing.

28:05.154 --> 28:08.988
[sighs] Well, that was
incredibly embarrassing.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.160
I think she makes a good
argument for waiting.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.422
How are you supposed to know
if someone's your soulmate?

28:13.422 --> 28:15.264
I think you just know.

28:15.264 --> 28:18.167
Unless you want
to get married at 18,

28:18.167 --> 28:20.369
waiting is totally
unrealistic.

28:20.369 --> 28:22.271
It's really not
an option for you...

28:23.803 --> 28:27.336
- ...since that ship's sailed.
- Yeah, well, bon voyage.

28:27.336 --> 28:31.010
Two weeks in high school and
you're already in detention.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.742
Just... Bravo!

28:32.742 --> 28:35.244
I wasn't drinking, Mom.
I swear!

28:35.244 --> 28:36.485
You don't have to swear.

28:36.485 --> 28:39.318
You can't even stomach Gram's
rum balls at Christmas.

28:40.349 --> 28:42.922
Why were you hanging out
with a bunch of losers?

28:42.922 --> 28:46.225
Do you know one of those guys
tried to drive their car
after he'd been drinking?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.496
He got arrested.

28:48.898 --> 28:51.300
What is up, Pay?

28:51.300 --> 28:55.164
OK, the last two weeks of
school have been really hard.

28:55.164 --> 28:58.407
It was hard for me to accept
that there was any reason
I should be there at all.

28:58.407 --> 29:01.370
Yes, you've made
your feelings very clear.

29:01.370 --> 29:05.915
But, the truth is, I learned
the most important lesson
of my life.

29:05.915 --> 29:08.247
I hope that lesson
is don't cut class

29:08.247 --> 29:10.119
and hang out
with drunk kids.

29:10.119 --> 29:14.523
Well, yeah, but I think
I finally get what you
were trying to tell me.

29:14.523 --> 29:17.957
I need to find something
in my life that I can
believe in and fight for.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.989
I don't know what that is
yet, but when I do,

29:19.989 --> 29:21.991
I'll conquer it just like
I conquered gymnastics.

29:21.991 --> 29:25.194
- Are you telling me this
to make me feel better?
- No!

29:26.395 --> 29:31.240
I thought my choice was
gymnastics or nothing.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.503
But it's gymnastics...

29:34.503 --> 29:37.146
...or everything else.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.250
It's really great
to hear you say that.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.383
I tried to be someone
who didn't care,

29:44.383 --> 29:46.085
and that's just not me.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.318
I'm a champion, Mom.

29:50.459 --> 29:52.061
Just like you said.

29:53.963 --> 29:57.026
I just need to find something
to be a champion at.

29:57.026 --> 30:00.499
And I will join every
damn club at that school
if that's what it takes.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.275
I can't believe
I just picked you up at
the principal's office.

30:07.977 --> 30:09.138
Now I'm hugging you.

30:16.185 --> 30:18.187
- Don't say "damn."
- Yes, ma'am.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.935
Ah.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.567
Carter.

30:38.567 --> 30:41.010
You gotta hand it to a guy
who just doesn't give up.

30:41.010 --> 30:42.471
Yeah.

30:44.313 --> 30:46.115
- We gotta...
- About our...

30:47.476 --> 30:49.248
You go.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.452
God, I don't know
how to put this.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.185
Uh... OK.

30:56.185 --> 31:00.990
You and me, we've kinda
had a couple of moments.

31:02.531 --> 31:04.033
Yeah.

31:04.033 --> 31:07.266
They weren't kinda moments,
they were actual moments.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.938
[chuckles] Right.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.073
And I just wanted
to say, uh...

31:15.204 --> 31:18.007
...that can't happen
anymore.

31:19.008 --> 31:20.879
Payson's one of
my best friends,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.112
and after what
I've been through,

31:24.914 --> 31:27.316
there's no way I'd do
anything to hurt a friend.

31:27.316 --> 31:28.988
Yeah.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.889
I spoke to her today.

31:32.061 --> 31:34.223
She said she had a boyfriend.

31:34.223 --> 31:36.225
That doesn't
sound like Payson.

31:36.225 --> 31:40.229
I know. I think she was
trying to get rid of me.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.934
I think that means
she likes you,

31:44.934 --> 31:47.336
which means...

31:47.336 --> 31:49.538
...we don't have
anything with each other.

31:49.538 --> 31:53.512
I've been recruited
by Denver for a while now.

31:55.214 --> 31:58.487
- I think I'm gonna go.
- You're gonna go to Denver?

31:58.487 --> 32:00.049
Yeah.

32:00.049 --> 32:03.252
There's just too much drama
and distractions here.

32:03.252 --> 32:07.926
I mean, between you
and Payson and Lauren...

32:07.926 --> 32:09.258
[softly] Yeah.

32:10.659 --> 32:12.461
It's just not good for me.

32:14.603 --> 32:16.365
So, uh...

32:19.338 --> 32:21.610
- Bad idea. Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:21.610 --> 32:23.142
Bad idea.

32:25.214 --> 32:26.675
Bye, Kaylie.

32:30.419 --> 32:32.151
One more thing.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.125
Uh, I just wanted
to thank you.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.227
After this thing with Carter,

32:38.227 --> 32:42.961
I didn't know if I'd ever get
butterflies with anyone,

32:42.961 --> 32:44.533
ever again.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.567
And it was nice to know
I could.

32:50.139 --> 32:51.970
Like, I'll survive this,
you know?

32:54.403 --> 32:55.744
You will.

33:10.419 --> 33:12.291
[car engine starts]

33:16.995 --> 33:20.069
I think I did
something... stupid.

33:20.069 --> 33:24.203
- What?
- I put rose petals
in the shape of a heart

33:24.203 --> 33:27.206
- on the hood of Kaylie's car.
- [sighs]

33:27.206 --> 33:29.007
I don't think it's stupid

33:29.007 --> 33:32.211
to show someone you're
thinking about them.

33:34.083 --> 33:37.786
Could I ask you a question?
As her friend and as a girl.

33:37.786 --> 33:39.618
Sure.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.151
You think she'll ever
be able to forgive me?

33:45.754 --> 33:47.226
I don't know.

33:48.697 --> 33:51.700
It's hard enough trusting
someone with your heart.

33:53.562 --> 33:55.634
And then when
that trust is broken...

33:57.736 --> 33:59.208
Are you OK?

34:01.240 --> 34:02.411
I'm sorry.

34:02.411 --> 34:05.214
It's OK. Do you want
to talk about it?

34:05.214 --> 34:07.476
It's just this guy,
Damon.

34:07.476 --> 34:10.249
I've seen him around.
Doesn't he work here?

34:10.249 --> 34:12.381
He did.

34:12.381 --> 34:15.354
He went to LA to sign
some big record deal,

34:15.354 --> 34:18.787
and now I haven't
heard from him in days.

34:18.787 --> 34:20.589
And I think he
might be dumping me.

34:20.589 --> 34:22.231
What about that other guy
that works here,

34:22.231 --> 34:24.263
aren't they in a band
together or something?

34:24.263 --> 34:27.236
Razor. He hasn't heard
from him either.

34:27.236 --> 34:30.439
And he acted sort of weird
when I talked to him about it.

34:30.439 --> 34:34.243
Listen, sometimes guys try
to have each other's backs,

34:34.243 --> 34:37.246
especially
when it comes to girls.

34:37.246 --> 34:39.378
Maybe you should
ask him again.

34:41.310 --> 34:44.413
I'd say we have
a perfect coupling here.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.855
I'm getting a sort
of a bittersweet berry

34:46.855 --> 34:49.758
with a strong dark
chocolate finish.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.091
- Mmm.
- [chuckling]

34:54.623 --> 34:56.265
Oh! What's wrong?
Did it go bad?

34:56.265 --> 34:59.128
No. Actually,
it's divine.

34:59.128 --> 35:01.230
At $400 a bottle,
it should be.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.772
Four hundred dollars
a bottle,

35:03.772 --> 35:06.275
and you just
dumped it out?

35:06.275 --> 35:08.307
You don't drink
the whole glass
at a tasting, Cloris.

35:08.307 --> 35:13.412
- It's Chloe.
- Right. Chloe.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.485
You know, this is delicious and
all, but to be honest with you,

35:16.485 --> 35:18.517
I really can't tell
the damn difference.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.589
[laughter]

35:21.320 --> 35:23.322
Oh, she's right.

35:23.322 --> 35:27.556
If they put a $400 price tag
on a two-dollar bottle of wine,

35:27.556 --> 35:29.398
you'd both be cooing

35:29.398 --> 35:33.232
over the peppery nose
with a huckleberry finish,

35:33.232 --> 35:36.405
or whatever crap makes
you feel so superior.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.607
Why don't we move on
to the Bordeauxs.

35:43.372 --> 35:46.345
Ooh, look at you,
man of the people.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.277
They're a couple
of blowhards.

35:48.277 --> 35:50.148
I don't know why
I brought you here.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.680
I'm sorry.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.425
Well, maybe because
it's the sort of thing

35:56.425 --> 35:58.427
you did with Summer.

35:58.427 --> 36:01.730
She's very pretty
and smart

36:01.730 --> 36:04.863
and put together,
she has it all.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.566
She doesn't have
your sense of humor

36:07.566 --> 36:09.568
or your sense of style.

36:10.399 --> 36:11.840
Well, that's true.

36:12.701 --> 36:14.303
Look...

36:14.303 --> 36:17.306
Summer has a lot of great
qualities, but so do you.

36:17.306 --> 36:20.279
You're fun,
and you're smart,

36:20.279 --> 36:23.282
far smarter than anybody
gives you credit for,

36:23.282 --> 36:25.584
probably 'cause you're
so damn good looking.

36:26.915 --> 36:29.518
Well, you're not so
bad looking yourself.

36:29.518 --> 36:33.892
So what do you say
we pick up a box of wine

36:33.892 --> 36:37.966
and go somewhere we can
actually drink it?

36:39.728 --> 36:41.199
OK.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.412
So thanks for bailing me out,
man. I owe you one.

36:54.283 --> 36:56.315
The only one you owe
is Emily.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.387
Seriously, man, when are
you just gonna tell her?

37:02.691 --> 37:04.693
How about right now?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.437
Thanks a lot, man.

37:19.608 --> 37:21.009
He didn't tell me.

37:21.009 --> 37:23.672
I followed him here
after his second

37:23.672 --> 37:25.944
mysterious pizza delivery
to the county jail.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.646
Listen, I was gonna
call you.

37:27.646 --> 37:31.520
When? When you left LA?

37:31.520 --> 37:33.852
When you got to Boulder?

37:33.852 --> 37:35.624
When you obviously
got arrested?

37:35.624 --> 37:38.287
When were you gonna call me?

37:38.287 --> 37:40.429
Listen, I couldn't
sign the deal in LA.

37:40.429 --> 37:42.461
Maybe I should've known
you were one of those guys.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.592
What, what guys?

37:43.592 --> 37:45.664
One of the guys
my mother dates.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.297
The ones who
won't call for days,

37:48.297 --> 37:50.899
and then will call from jail
when they need bail money.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.373
- Emily...
- I've been terrified

37:54.373 --> 37:57.476
that you've been lying
in a ditch somewhere.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.848
Or that this was
your way of dumping me.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.583
- I can't trust you.
- Yes. Yes, you can.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.517
How can you say that,
when the last time I saw you

38:08.517 --> 38:12.290
you were in LA supposedly
signing some big record deal?

38:12.290 --> 38:15.063
- No, not "supposedly."
- What about our pact, Damon?

38:16.525 --> 38:19.498
You promised me you would
never lie to me.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.770
- Emily, listen...
- No.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.772
We have nothing
to talk about.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.737
And you should've
told me the truth.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.723
[groans]

38:48.326 --> 38:50.098
Happy Valentine's Day.

38:50.098 --> 38:53.862
♪ Welcome back
to solid ground ♪

38:53.862 --> 38:57.065
♪ Toughen up
to turn it out ♪

38:57.065 --> 39:00.609
♪ You got your feet wet
squeaky clean ♪

39:00.609 --> 39:02.871
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:07.776 --> 39:10.449
So, what changed your mind?

39:12.521 --> 39:13.522
You.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.556
Look, if I can lose control,
then they're bound to,

39:17.556 --> 39:20.689
and if the idea of choice
and a higher purpose

39:20.689 --> 39:24.993
can make them feel empowered
to abstain from sex

39:24.993 --> 39:26.995
then it works for me.

39:29.738 --> 39:31.400
- About...
- About last night...

39:31.400 --> 39:33.472
[chuckles] Go ahead.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.605
- It was...
- Inappropriate.

39:39.007 --> 39:41.450
And... And should
never happen again.

39:41.450 --> 39:43.712
- I think that's best.
- Yeah.

39:48.457 --> 39:50.459
[telephone rings]

39:51.389 --> 39:53.522
[chuckles] All right.

39:53.522 --> 39:55.393
- Um, I'll get it.
- [ringing]

39:56.725 --> 39:58.527
You go home.

40:04.573 --> 40:05.704
Sasha Belov.

40:07.536 --> 40:08.677
Yes.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.710
Yeah.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.545
- Hey!
- Hi.

40:16.545 --> 40:17.716
I brought
Sleepless in Seattle.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.087
I love that movie.
Come on in.

40:20.489 --> 40:21.950
Thanks for coming over.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.594
Mom, this is Heather.

40:25.594 --> 40:29.798
- Oh, hi, Heather.
- Hi, Mrs. Keeler.
Thanks for inviting me.

40:29.798 --> 40:33.031
Valentine's Day
without a Valentine
can be so depressing.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.934
That's why I sent us
both those roses.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.807
- So that was you!
- [laughing]

40:38.807 --> 40:41.610
- Yes, it was me.
- I think it's sweet.

40:41.610 --> 40:44.012
- [door opens]
- [Kaylie] Anybody home?

40:44.012 --> 40:46.475
Oh. Well, I invited
some old friends, too.

40:46.475 --> 40:48.617
- [Payson] Yeah! Hi!
- Hi!

40:48.617 --> 40:51.620
- Happy Valentine's Day, guys!
- Happy Valentine's Day.

40:51.620 --> 40:54.653
Awesome. Sleepover.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.695
[sighs]

41:22.751 --> 41:25.514
"I know how much this picture
of your mother means to you,

41:25.514 --> 41:29.788
and thought it deserved a frame.
Happy V-Day, Lauren."

41:35.694 --> 41:37.566
[Chloe laughs] Steve! Shh!

41:41.970 --> 41:43.501
OK, OK.

41:45.834 --> 41:48.176
Stop! Don't... [gasps]

41:50.238 --> 41:52.611
- Oh, it's dark in here.
- Hang on.

41:55.684 --> 41:58.146
Now, are you sure
Lauren won't catch us?

41:58.146 --> 42:00.148
Ah, she never
comes up here.

42:00.148 --> 42:02.951
Sorry it's a little...
unfinished,

42:02.951 --> 42:06.625
but, uh,
it's the only place
we can be all alone.

42:06.625 --> 42:10.028
[Chloe] I wonder what
she'd think if she knew
we were dating.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.800
[Steve] Are we? Dating?

42:11.800 --> 42:14.703
Why don't you ask me after
a few glasses of that wine?

42:14.703 --> 42:16.935
[shouts, laughs]

42:16.935 --> 42:20.168
[Chloe] Ohh!
Steve! [laughs]

42:20.168 --> 42:22.711
Compete against each other,
but you're also friends?

42:22.711 --> 42:24.743
Well, we compete
as a team, too.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.845
Gymnastics can be so grueling,
only the girls you train with

42:26.845 --> 42:29.017
really understand
what you're going through.

42:29.017 --> 42:31.850
And even though
you compete against
each other,

42:31.850 --> 42:33.551
you gotta have
each other's backs.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.083
How long have you guys
been training together?

42:35.083 --> 42:37.656
Ten years, except Emily.
She's the new girl.

42:37.656 --> 42:41.690
Like Payson!
But don't worry, I've taken
Payson under my wing.

42:41.690 --> 42:44.833
So... maybe you can tell us
about Payson's new boyfriend.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.696
She won't tell us,
but we're dying to know.

42:47.696 --> 42:51.339
He didn't turn out
to be my type.

42:51.339 --> 42:53.702
Just give it some time.
Kaylie and Nicky
didn't like each other

42:53.702 --> 42:55.573
and you should see them now.

42:56.244 --> 42:57.946
What?

42:57.946 --> 43:00.578
You didn't hear
about Nicky?

43:00.578 --> 43:04.012
- What?
- So he called you?

43:04.012 --> 43:06.584
- Mm-hmm.
- What about Nicky?

43:06.584 --> 43:09.658
- He's going to Denver.
- What?! He can't!

43:09.658 --> 43:12.020
Said there was too much
drama at the Rock.

43:12.020 --> 43:15.694
- [all laughing]
- I can't believe this.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.697
He told me what you said
about never doing anything
to hurt a friend.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.869
We have to watch
each other's backs, right?

43:21.770 --> 43:23.672
[Kaylie] No exceptions.

43:23.672 --> 43:25.974
Um, yeah, I know,
it's been a rough day.

43:25.974 --> 43:28.777
But, Mark, for the first time
since Payson's accident

43:28.777 --> 43:30.839
I feel like...

43:30.839 --> 43:33.181
I feel like she's gonna be OK.

43:33.181 --> 43:38.286
I feel like she's finally
accepted gymnastics is over.

43:38.286 --> 43:41.289
But there's a big,
beautiful world out there

43:41.289 --> 43:43.792
just waiting for her
to conquer it.

43:43.792 --> 43:47.395
Payson's gonna be OK.
She's gonna move on.

43:47.395 --> 43:49.327
- [line beeps]
- Hey, Mark, hold on a second.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.299
The phone's beeping.

43:51.299 --> 43:53.962
Sasha, I'm so sorry,
I forgot to call you back.

43:53.962 --> 43:56.004
Everything's OK with Payson.

43:56.004 --> 43:58.236
[Sasha] Good, because
I have great news.

43:58.236 --> 44:01.670
I just got off the phone
with an orthopedic surgeon
in Geneva.

44:01.670 --> 44:03.371
She heard about Payson's case,

44:03.371 --> 44:06.414
and she's developed
a new procedure that
could fix Payson's back.

44:06.414 --> 44:10.679
According to her,
she could still do gymnastics
on a competitive level.

44:13.181 --> 44:14.683
Isn't that amazing?

44:14.683 --> 44:17.085
This just might be the miracle
we've all hoped for.
