WEBVTT

00:06.136 --> 00:08.356
All right,
Pasadena Dodgers.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.488
It's our first game
of the season.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.795
All your hard work
is about to pay off.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.884
Yeah. Pay off.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.974
And it is time to
collect dividends.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.150
And you are all too young
to understand

00:20.194 --> 00:21.238
the banking metaphors.

00:23.197 --> 00:26.113
Is anybody else nervous that
we don't have our uniforms yet?

00:26.156 --> 00:28.811
KIDS: Yeah.Hey, hey, hey,
uh, uh, relax.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.813
The team sponsor
promised to bring them

00:30.856 --> 00:33.076
before the season starts,
all right? [laughs]

00:33.120 --> 00:35.557
Man, that's in, like,
five minutes. [clears throat]

00:36.601 --> 00:38.212
But, hey, in the meantime,
let's, um...

00:38.255 --> 00:39.517
get on our feet,

00:39.561 --> 00:40.910
let's close our eyes

00:40.953 --> 00:43.304
and do some deep
breathing exercises.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
Oh, yeah. Breathing.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.176
Very Zen.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.352
Now, breathe in.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.093
One, two, three.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.181
Breathe out.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.053
One, two, three.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.880
When I say "whoo,"

00:54.924 --> 00:56.404
you say "sah."

00:56.447 --> 00:58.362
Whoo.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.060
ALL:
Sah.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.409
Whoo.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.540
ALL:
Sah.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.891
Uh, son, that's "Wu-Tang."

01:05.935 --> 01:07.458
All right?

01:07.502 --> 01:08.938
Know the classics.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.548
[chuckles]:
All right?

01:10.592 --> 01:13.160
And speaking of something
that's also for the children,

01:13.203 --> 01:14.378
check these out.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.685
[chuckles]:
Hey!

01:16.728 --> 01:18.991
Oh, man. Those look
like real Dodger uniforms

01:19.035 --> 01:20.602
that got left
in the dryer too long.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.907
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.301
You know what?
And here's the best part.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.521
Bam!

01:27.391 --> 01:30.307
Whoa. [chuckling]
Look at that.

01:30.351 --> 01:31.482
Very subtle, Pop.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.441
Uh, was the Goodyear Blimp
unavailable?

01:33.484 --> 01:35.051
Well, it-it gets better.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.488
Because, during night games,

01:37.532 --> 01:39.186
my face gets highlighted.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.927
It's like Vegas.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.364
But instead of Donny
and Marie,

01:43.407 --> 01:44.843
it's me.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.629
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:47.672 --> 01:48.804
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.593
Hey, it's not too small, is it?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.990
No, Pop. This is youth baseball,

02:01.033 --> 02:03.427
but that is
a major league banner.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.301
So, what do you want me to do,
Coach?

02:07.344 --> 02:08.650
I can get the kids started

02:08.693 --> 02:11.087
with some calisthenics
and some wind sprints.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.523
Maybe some shuttle runs.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.526
Uh, no. No, see, that's
a little old-school, Pop.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.702
Before we do any physical work,

02:17.746 --> 02:21.010
we do visualization exercises.

02:22.403 --> 02:23.665
See the ball.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.840
Be the ball.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.538
And... throw the ball.

02:30.062 --> 02:30.846
Now...

02:30.889 --> 02:32.500
catch the ball.[grunts]

02:33.370 --> 02:34.937
See that, Dad?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.678
I just jumped four feet
and caught it off the wall.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.942
Imaginary Gold Glove
goes to you, buddy.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.946
Since we're imagining things,

02:43.989 --> 02:46.427
I'm gonna imagine I just
didn't see that. What is...

02:46.470 --> 02:48.124
Listen, I'm just trying

02:48.168 --> 02:50.822
to take a more holistic
approach to the game, man.

02:50.866 --> 02:54.174
It's important to train
their minds and their bodies.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.827
[laughs] Son,

02:55.871 --> 02:58.874
Babe Ruth once ate
12 hot dogs before a game.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.659
That man wasn't worried
about his mind or his body.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.705
And he was a winner.

03:03.748 --> 03:06.360
Well, there's more to
sports than winning, Pop.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.884
What? Son, come on, now.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.712
I taught you better than that.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.584
My coaching got you
all the way to the pros.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.020
Let me see your lineup card.

03:15.064 --> 03:18.328
[laughs]
Cards are so old-school, man.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.590
It's an app now.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.723
Give me the thing.Oh.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.291
Okay, so you got A.J.
at first base.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.292
Wh-Which one is A.J.?

03:25.335 --> 03:26.684
Oh. Right over there.

03:26.728 --> 03:27.685
The one wearing his glove

03:27.729 --> 03:29.121
as a hat.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.733
Okay.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.822
That's not gonna work at all.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.433
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
What are you doing, Pop?

03:36.477 --> 03:38.130
Call me old-fashioned,

03:38.174 --> 03:40.132
but I'm putting in
your best players.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.743
And we may...

03:41.786 --> 03:44.398
use an actual ball.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.269
Hey, kid! Heads up!

03:46.313 --> 03:47.923
[smack][kid groans]

03:49.838 --> 03:52.797
Okay, let's-let's imagine
that didn't happen.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.280
Cupcakes!

03:57.324 --> 03:59.978
Get your cupcakes
here!

04:00.022 --> 04:02.938
Made with peanuts
and Cracker Jacks!

04:02.981 --> 04:05.810
And I do care
if you ever come back!

04:06.594 --> 04:08.726
Hey, uh, Mommy...
[chuckles]

04:08.770 --> 04:10.598
...would you, uh, hook
your favorite son up

04:10.641 --> 04:12.121
with one of those cupcakes?

04:12.164 --> 04:15.429
Oh, well, these are free samples
to drum up my business.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.039
But for you, baby,

04:17.082 --> 04:19.433
Mommy has a extra.[chuckling]: Oh.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.262
That's what I'm talking about.[chuckles]

04:23.306 --> 04:25.177
Did your finger just slip

04:25.221 --> 04:27.789
or did you just wipe off
some of my frosting?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.444
What? There's too much frosting.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.013
I worked hard to get my
cake-to-frosting ratio perfect.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.407
And youare not worthy
to eat it. Gimme![stammers]

04:37.451 --> 04:39.409
You're not worthy!Please!
[whimpering]

04:39.888 --> 04:41.063
Cupcakes!

04:41.106 --> 04:43.805
Get your perfectly frosted
cupcakes here!

04:45.154 --> 04:46.416
All right,
come on, Noah!

04:46.460 --> 04:47.983
You got this!MALCOLM:
Come on.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.724
See the ball, be the ball.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.334
Just hit the ball.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.468
[cheering, applause]

04:54.511 --> 04:55.947
Whoa!

04:55.991 --> 04:57.209
Oh, that's out of here!All right!

04:57.253 --> 04:59.081
That's what I'm talking about!

04:59.124 --> 05:01.649
Oh, man, Noah really crushed
that thing, huh?

05:01.692 --> 05:03.128
CALVIN:
And whose idea

05:03.172 --> 05:04.826
was it to have him
bat cleanup?

05:04.869 --> 05:06.349
Oh, I believe his face

05:06.393 --> 05:08.612
is on the back
of their uniforms.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.180
Yeah, I guess you were
right this time, Pop.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.312
Oh.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.009
Just like most
of the great coach dads.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.837
Think Venus and Serena's father.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.447
Tiger Woods' daddy.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.622
LaVar Ball.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.190
Okay, the jury's still out
on that one.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.627
But, better yet, your father.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.368
Lucky you.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.634
Nice win today, buddy.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.376
You know, you guys played like
real big leaguers out there.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.551
I mean, I guess.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.292
But I'd feel more like
a big leaguer

05:36.336 --> 05:38.207
if you'd let me walk
to the park by myself.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.730
Even A.J.'s
parents

05:39.774 --> 05:40.862
let him go on his own,

05:40.905 --> 05:42.385
and he still has...

05:42.429 --> 05:44.082
"accidents."

05:44.126 --> 05:46.868
You really want to walk
to the park by yourself?

05:46.911 --> 05:49.087
Because, you know...

05:49.131 --> 05:51.307
I cherish
those walks.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.745
Well, um, what your
dad means is w...

05:54.789 --> 05:56.399
uh, we'll talk about it. Okay?

05:56.443 --> 05:58.662
Why don't you go
up and change?

05:58.706 --> 05:59.881
Okay.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.232
That's our baby.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.973
I know.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.409
That said,

06:06.453 --> 06:08.455
I'm totally fine
letting him walk by himself.

06:08.498 --> 06:11.153
You know, but if
you're not, I get it.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.547
Oh, I-I'm...
[sputters] I'm ready.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.375
I just don't want to rush you.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.202
Oh, no, I'm
already there.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.205
I'm totally cool letting
him walk five long blocks

06:20.249 --> 06:24.035
through the streets of
Pasadena all by himself.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.429
Yeah. Me, too.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.345
I don't even care
if there's a 30% chance

06:29.389 --> 06:30.738
of rain.Oh.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.261
Cool.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.523
Cool.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.874
Cool.Cool. Cool.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.573
You know, I hate
to say it, man, but...

06:39.616 --> 06:42.097
that kid can't catch or hit.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.925
Or high-five.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.580
Look, if we're planning
on winning,

06:46.623 --> 06:48.277
we're gonna have to make
some changes,

06:48.320 --> 06:51.498
starting with getting A.J.
to switch to soccer.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.458
Everybody plays
these days, Pop.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.722
And they should, because they
are here to have fun.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.116
But... thank you for your help.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.685
So, what you're saying
is "no thanks."

07:04.728 --> 07:06.730
Maybe you forgot

07:06.774 --> 07:08.471
who got you the win last time.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.733
It--

07:09.777 --> 07:11.909
Maybe we should visualize it.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.565
I visualize a great man.

07:15.609 --> 07:19.482
A wise and all-knowing coach

07:19.526 --> 07:21.876
with a hardheaded son.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.618
Oh, uh...

07:24.661 --> 07:28.186
Oh, I-- Wait, I-I...
I'm not seeing any of that.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.494
Yeah?Now, I hate
to break it to you,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.670
but you are not
the coach of this team.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.804
All right, everybody line up
for some pregame yoga.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.109
[whistle blows]

07:38.153 --> 07:39.807
What are you g-- hell no.

07:39.850 --> 07:43.375
I got my own yoga. It's called
running laps until you puke.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.073
[whistle blows]Let's go.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.466
What? Everybody stop!

07:46.509 --> 07:48.511
[whistle blows]

07:48.555 --> 07:49.599
Tree pose.

07:52.559 --> 07:55.997
Uh, trees don't
play baseball, Malcolm.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.347
[whistle blows]Go! Get it!

07:58.390 --> 07:59.827
Let's run!Wait a minute, stop!

07:59.870 --> 08:01.045
[whistle blowing]

08:01.089 --> 08:03.874
Stop... Stop.Keep going. Run it off.

08:05.963 --> 08:09.358
Triple Play here,
get your Triple Play.

08:09.401 --> 08:13.841
Everything you love about
baseball, now in cupcake form.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.670
I'll try one of those.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.107
Oh, sure. Here you go.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.550
Doesn't anybody
respect cupcakes anymore?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.117
It's got too much frosting.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.076
No offense, sir, but you have
frosting for brains.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.643
Give it back.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.950
Seriously?Yeah. Seriously.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.604
You're not deserving
of my cupcake.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.648
Come on.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.258
Okay.
[stammers]

08:40.302 --> 08:41.999
Sorry about that, Alejandro.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.001
Let me just talk to
my friend for a minute.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.482
Take your time.
I'm going to the snack bar,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.353
where they're not as judgy.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.878
Tina.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.140
Do you know who that was?

08:52.183 --> 08:54.534
Yeah, A.J.'s
no-taste-having daddy.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.666
Yeah, but he's
also a food critic

08:56.710 --> 08:58.799
with a huge
Instagram following.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.540
How huge?

09:00.583 --> 09:03.673
He got a Wienerschnitzel
kicked out of his neighborhood.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.023
So it won't be
good if he writes

09:06.067 --> 09:08.069
a bad review of
your cupcakes.

09:08.112 --> 09:11.072
[sighs] Well, ain't that
some schnitzel?

09:16.033 --> 09:17.295
You're out!

09:17.339 --> 09:20.647
I know. Now I'm also deaf.

09:22.431 --> 09:25.216
I love you unconditionally, son.

09:26.261 --> 09:29.177
Grover was a mile
behind that pitch, man.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.918
You know what? Uh, Ump, time.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.659
Come here.Whoa, whoa, hey.

09:32.702 --> 09:33.877
What are you doing, Pa?

09:33.921 --> 09:35.966
I'm making the hard decisions
you won't.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.707
Noah, you're pinch-hitting.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.579
Ben, to the bench.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.193
I love you unconditionally,
too, Ben.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.281
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.587
T-This is my team.

09:47.630 --> 09:48.979
What I say goes.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.633
Well, I'm gonna take over

09:50.677 --> 09:53.549
before you steer this team
into a ditch.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.683
All right, look, Pop, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.336
You're kicking me out?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.688
Yes, I am.
Baseball has changed, old-timer.

10:01.731 --> 10:05.039
Oh, is that a fact?
Do they still do this?

10:05.082 --> 10:06.649
Huh?

10:08.782 --> 10:10.784
No, Pop.
[chuckles]

10:10.827 --> 10:11.959
It's more like this.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.222
[inhales, exhales]Mm.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.050
[grunts]Oh!

10:16.093 --> 10:18.139
So you gonna do it like that?Yeah, I'm-a do it like that.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.938
Get out of here, Pop.
I've got a game to coach.

10:34.982 --> 10:38.289
You know what? You want me
to fall back, I will.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.466
See the loss, be the loss.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.904
Oh-ho, you know what?
That is it, Pop.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.950
Let me put this in a language
you can understand.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.344
You are out of here!

10:50.171 --> 10:52.477
Okay, all right, uh, guys,

10:52.521 --> 10:54.088
I-I know you're working
through something right now,

10:54.131 --> 10:55.829
but technically,
I think the umpire

10:55.872 --> 10:58.527
is the only one who can
toss somebody from a game.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.876
Don't look at me, man.
I'm only doing this

10:59.920 --> 11:01.312
for community service.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.011
Fine, Malcolm.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.927
You want me to go, then I'll go.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.669
Ok-- All right. Guys, baseball

11:09.712 --> 11:12.628
is supposed to bring
fathers and sons together.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.629
Um, Dad?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.109
Grover, not now.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.417
Now, please,
let's just talk about this.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.202
No. You know what? Enough talk.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.378
You got players out here
being trees

11:23.421 --> 11:27.382
and woosah-ing and drinking
wheatgrass shots.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.123
Well, when you come
to your senses,

11:29.166 --> 11:30.820
you know where to find me.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.735

11:33.910 --> 11:35.738
Oh, and one last thing.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.261
[whistle blows]

11:39.916 --> 11:43.572
Well, what do you mean
I can't cancel my oven delivery?

11:43.615 --> 11:47.184
Okay, fine. I take
my "good afternoon"

11:47.228 --> 11:50.144
and "I hope your day
is going well" back.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.800
[mutters][groans]

11:53.843 --> 11:55.584
I see you're having one of
those kind of days, too.

11:55.627 --> 11:56.890
Ugh, man,

11:56.933 --> 11:58.369
I pissed off a food critic.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.806
I don't even want
to talk about it.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.285
What's going on with you?

12:01.329 --> 12:04.549
Your disrespectful son
kicked me out the game.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.595
What did you do?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.511
Absolutely nothing.

12:09.554 --> 12:13.776
All I tried to do
was share my wisdom.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.910
Oh, boy.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.085
Wait a minute.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.782
Are you taking his side?

12:19.826 --> 12:20.914
[sighs]

12:20.957 --> 12:22.350
Calvin, what's going on?

12:22.393 --> 12:24.439
Look, I just thought

12:24.482 --> 12:26.441
it was gonna be
the way it used to be.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.182
Uh-- Baseball was
always our thing,

12:28.225 --> 12:32.012
and-- but now, it seems
like he doesn't need me.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.623
Baby, you are a great father,

12:34.666 --> 12:38.105
which also means
knowing you've done your job.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.802
Yeah, I guess.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.284
And the beauty is, knowing that
all of their accomplishments

12:43.327 --> 12:46.069
come right back to us
because we raised them.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.462
Boom.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.942
[laughs]

12:48.985 --> 12:52.815
Okay. I guess, when you put it
that way, I'll back off.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.862
All right.But for the record, backing off

12:55.905 --> 12:59.126
is not how you get Will Smith
to play you in a movie.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.827
Thanks for finally letting me
walk to the park by myself.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.263
Oh, yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.830
Hey, your mom went to go get
snacks before the game,

13:07.874 --> 13:09.353
but we'll both
meet you at the park.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.877
Cool.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.792
Wait, which way
is the park again?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.316
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.057
[chuckles]
Okay.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.885
Bye, Dad.All right, buddy,
have a good time.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.192
We'll see you at the game.
Bye, Grover.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.985
Hey, uh, Marty, can you
come over and bring your drone?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.814
Of course you have a drone.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.991
Your bumper sticker says
"E.T. Drone Home."

13:51.265 --> 13:53.876
DAVE:
Okay, all right.
There's Grover.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.357
He's fine. See-- I was
worried for nothing.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.186
No, man, I told you
this was a safe neighborhood.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.361
Hold on.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.189
Is there someone following him?

14:02.232 --> 14:05.366
There's definitely
someone following him.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.195
What kind of sicko
follows a kid?

14:08.238 --> 14:11.589
Give me those controls.
Give me that.Wait, you are not certified!

14:13.678 --> 14:15.463
What the...?

14:15.506 --> 14:19.032
Some sicko with a drone
is following Grover.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.424
Wait a second.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.601
That creep is Gemma.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.603
Gemma?
What's she doing out there?

14:25.647 --> 14:28.824
Well, she is lying to me
about getting snacks.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.046
DAVE:
Uh, Gemma,
I know what you're doing,

14:33.089 --> 14:36.527
because this thing is HD
and I don't see any snacks.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.140
Dave, why are you in a drone?

14:40.183 --> 14:42.098
Because I was
worried that Grover

14:42.142 --> 14:43.621
would be followed
by some weirdo.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.797
Apparently, that weirdo is you.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.018
Oh, hi, Melody.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.281
Just talking to Dave in a drone.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.371
So you're stalking our son now?

14:54.415 --> 14:56.460
Totally not cool.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.548
Wh-- Oh, yeah? Oh, I guess

14:57.592 --> 14:59.289
neither one of us are as cool

14:59.333 --> 15:00.943
as we thought we were.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.553
Mom?

15:02.597 --> 15:03.641
Dad?

15:04.468 --> 15:07.123
Now, this is real uncool.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.126
Yeah, we've already
established that.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.270
Hi, Mr. Gomez.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.837
Um, yeah, I-I know who you are.

15:25.881 --> 15:29.406
So before you write something
nasty about my cupcakes...

15:29.450 --> 15:30.712
L-Let me stop you right there.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.149
I already wrote my review.
I just posted it.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.759
Really?

15:34.803 --> 15:36.979
I mean, how could you
even sleep at night

15:37.023 --> 15:39.677
knowing that you're killing
a Black-owned business?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.636
I-I'm not even
a mom-and-pop shop.

to cuss you out?

15:51.341 --> 15:52.821
Please don't.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.954
Gemma gave me another cupcake
and I loved it.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.305
With all the frosting,
just as the artist intended.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.481
Well, okay, then.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.310
[laughs] Oh, I'm sorry
I went off earlier

16:03.353 --> 16:05.616
I'm passionate about food.Oh...

16:05.660 --> 16:08.097
I need to learn to keep
my opinions to myself.

Apology accepted.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.275

on your french fries?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.543
Are you out of your mind?

16:23.852 --> 16:26.289
Baby, I know it's hard for you
to just sit here and watch,

16:26.333 --> 16:29.814
but you're doing a great job at
letting Malcolm do his thing.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.294
You were right, babe.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.775
You know, I need to let go.Yeah.

is shooting a TikTok video
in the outfield.

Look, Grover's coming to bat
with the bases loaded.

your light upon Grover
