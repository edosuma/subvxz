WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:07.480
Buddha, we might have
to postpone the wedding,

00:07.559 --> 00:08.679
depends on rehearsals.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.560
It's the role of a lifetime.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.400
Okay, shut up already.
-What?

00:12.480 --> 00:15.000
You didn't stop talking

00:15.080 --> 00:16.600
and only about yourself.
-Yuvi, dude...

00:16.679 --> 00:18.480
I couldn't care less about Nina

00:18.640 --> 00:20.079
Reut, how 'bout you?
-The play was amazing.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.079
Cut the bull.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.160
I'm a huge fan.

00:28.359 --> 00:29.679
He doesn't speak English...

00:30.039 --> 00:31.320
There's nobody inside.
-Yes.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.280
No! No!

00:36.079 --> 00:38.280
You're not ready
for a dramatic lead role.

00:38.359 --> 00:42.119
An actor that doesn't truly
live life, take risks and gets dirty

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
is a dead actor.

00:43.399 --> 00:45.280
Did you fall asleep?
-I'm not 80 years old.

00:45.359 --> 00:47.320
Do I look like I fell asleep?
-You don't look like it,

00:47.439 --> 00:48.399
you did.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.280
Sorry for disturbing you,
go back to sleep.

00:50.359 --> 00:52.479
Did you send me a dick pic?

00:54.479 --> 00:56.280
It's yours?
-This is so embarrassing.

01:17.079 --> 01:18.079
Hi.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.079
Hi.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.159
What are you doing in town?

01:25.040 --> 01:26.280
I come here sometimes.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.319
Does Reut know you're here?

01:29.280 --> 01:31.439
Yeah, we just had a beer together.
-Oh yeah?

01:31.599 --> 01:33.680
He didn't tell me.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.680
Why should he tell you?
What are you, his mother?

01:39.079 --> 01:40.480
No, you...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.159
know so much
about relationships.

01:42.239 --> 01:44.400
Ever thought of being
a couples therapist?

01:45.040 --> 01:46.079
Ever thought of being
a psychologist?

01:46.120 --> 01:47.640
You're such a good listener.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.959
What do you want from me?

01:49.200 --> 01:52.000
Absolutely nothing.
-What's eating at you?

01:52.079 --> 01:55.480
Are you jealous that Reut is better-looking
and more successful than you?

01:55.560 --> 01:56.480
Jealous?

01:56.719 --> 02:00.159
I feel sorry that a handsome,
good-hearted man like him

02:00.280 --> 02:01.680
is gonna end up
with a girl like you.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.480
You were a virgin for many years,
weren't you?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.480
It was hard for you
to find girls in...

02:07.079 --> 02:08.960
that stupid village of yours.
-Town.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.159
We live in a town, okay, numbskull?

02:12.280 --> 02:15.080
I understand that you want me
and are beside yourself.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.400
I'm about to tell you something,

02:18.479 --> 02:20.719
so hold on to the shelves
so you don't pass out.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.680
Ready?
-Yeah..

02:24.319 --> 02:25.479
I don't think you're pretty.

02:25.599 --> 02:26.560
You just aren't.

02:26.639 --> 02:29.000
And the more
you think you're pretty,

02:29.360 --> 02:30.319
the less pretty you become.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.319
I really can't stand you.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
I'd rather get hemorrhoids
in my asshole than touch you.

02:37.639 --> 02:39.319
You think you're impressing me
with your filthy mouth?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.680
I eat men like you for breakfast.
-Oh yeah?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.120
Then eat me.
-You wish!

02:43.280 --> 02:44.319
Oh yeah?
You wish. Eat me.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.319
You wish!
-You wish!

02:45.439 --> 02:46.319
You wish!
-You wish...

03:27.080 --> 03:28.000
What was that?

03:29.560 --> 03:31.280
Did you accidentally pee?

03:39.159 --> 03:41.319
Oh my god, you're so cute.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.319
Goodbye.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.560
It seems that we
are leaving here today.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.479
We shall probably never see
each other again.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.319
I seldom meet

04:10.039 --> 04:12.159
a young and pretty girl now.

04:12.479 --> 04:15.319
I should like
to change places with you...

04:15.520 --> 04:17.000
No, no, no!

04:17.199 --> 04:18.720
Turn the lights on!

04:26.519 --> 04:27.680
This is ugly.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.560
Middle stage is empty.
-Kasha,

04:34.600 --> 04:37.160
there are two more actors
that are dancing in the middle.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.319
What?
-But he sent them home.

04:39.399 --> 04:40.399
What, what?

04:41.360 --> 04:43.959
You have more people there.
-Then where are they?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.600
You sent them home.
-Kasha,

04:46.279 --> 04:47.279
please help me,

04:47.360 --> 04:49.680
help me, go up and dance.

04:50.519 --> 04:53.000
Go up and dance. Please.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.639
Okay.

05:03.439 --> 05:06.000
Here, the couch-director
can help us out.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.279
Okay, come.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.639
Come, come, come.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.600
Me?
-I need someone to dance with.

05:13.959 --> 05:17.319
Please. -Come. Thank you.
Thank you very much, come.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.439
Music.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.480
Lights.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.319
Okay, so what we do?
-Dance.

05:34.399 --> 05:37.600
Goodbye. It seems that we
are leaving here today.

05:38.319 --> 05:40.560
We shall probably never see
each other again.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.439
I seldom meet
a young and pretty girl now.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.240
I should like to change places with you,
if but for an hour.

05:49.439 --> 05:53.160
All this big production just so you
can ask me out for a beer?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.600
Yeah.
-Wow.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.120
Hi.
-Hi. -Hi.

06:40.319 --> 06:41.439
I...

06:42.680 --> 06:47.279
want remind you.
-Yes?

06:48.360 --> 06:49.959
That me.

06:52.439 --> 06:55.720
I want remind you that me.
-Okay.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.439
Okay. -I understand,
I didn't forget about you.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.600
Oh, good.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.079
So tonight

07:01.600 --> 07:03.399
do you want to have
a beer or...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.079
Oh no, I changed my mind.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.639
Already?
-Yes, I thought maybe tonight

07:08.680 --> 07:11.319
instead of going out,
we can go to

07:11.399 --> 07:12.560
your place.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.319
To my place?
-Yes.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.959
I would invite you
to my place and cook for you,

07:19.319 --> 07:22.160
but Groshovsky and I,
we live in the same apartment, so...

07:22.279 --> 07:23.720
No, no, sure, sure, yes.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.319
No...

07:26.040 --> 07:29.240
Just don't expect anything special.
-No, it's okay.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.480
That's fine.
-And also I don't have any food,

07:31.519 --> 07:33.439
so maybe a restaurant?
-You're funny.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.680
What? -No, it's just,
a girl asks to come to your place,

07:38.480 --> 07:39.720
what didn't you get?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.160
I get.
-You get? You sure? -I get.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.079
I get. -Okay , call me.
-Okay. -Okay.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.399
Do the Hebrew again?
-Wait, I need to... Okay.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.279
I want remind...
-To remind.

07:54.319 --> 07:56.079
To remind...

07:57.079 --> 08:00.480
You. -You. -Me.
-Okay. -Okay.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.560
So I see you later.
-Good.

08:09.959 --> 08:11.959
Good morning.
How are you?

08:12.680 --> 08:15.160
Good.
-Before we go in,

08:15.240 --> 08:17.279
scene six is...

08:17.720 --> 08:19.680
it's not working, it's still...

08:20.720 --> 08:22.319
missing an edge.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.240
Yeah?
-Yeah. It's...

08:26.519 --> 08:28.480
It's good after you rewrote it,
but...

08:30.199 --> 08:32.080
it's missing an edge.

08:32.399 --> 08:35.440
Yeah? -Yeah, we can work on it
afterwards if you want.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.600
No.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.720
I'll find an edge.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.480
Just a little... edge.
-Gotcha.

09:31.679 --> 09:34.679
Here you go. Make me look good
on the dancefloor, okay?

09:36.080 --> 09:37.080
Thanks.

09:39.399 --> 09:42.120
You guys are gorgeous.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.120
Thanks. Um, Iris,
these pajamas are very ugly,

09:45.480 --> 09:47.000
could you ask Tomer
to change it?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.480
No, he loves those pajamas,

09:49.559 --> 09:50.559
it's his "concept."

09:51.120 --> 09:53.320
Great, another director
with a "concept"...

09:54.519 --> 09:56.000
Want me to talk to him?

09:56.399 --> 09:58.159
I'll change his mind
in a flash.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
Maya.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.480
You're really going for it, huh, Maya?

10:02.559 --> 10:05.000
Totally.
He's it, he's the one.

10:08.039 --> 10:09.679
Oh, I don't get an invitation?

10:11.080 --> 10:13.960
Maya, how many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

10:14.039 --> 10:16.320
I'm sorry for calling you
a model, I'm sorry.

10:16.399 --> 10:19.399
Great, the costumes are here.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.000
Let me see you.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.080
You guys are so cute.
I love it. What do you think? -Wow.

10:28.559 --> 10:30.600
How does it feel?
Is it okay?

10:30.679 --> 10:34.440
The waistband is too tight.
-Sarel, ask Olga

10:34.480 --> 10:36.679
to fix his waistband.
Maya?

10:37.240 --> 10:38.399
It's great.
-Good.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.720
Okay, let's get to work.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.480
I'm sorry.
-Thanks, Iris.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.279
Start feeling the clothes,
work with them.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.480
Where did we leave off yesterday?
-Scene six.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.960
But Tomer,
do you feel like trying

10:51.039 --> 10:52.639
a new scene that I wrote?

10:55.120 --> 10:56.159
Oh.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.240
If you want to.
-Yeah.

10:58.279 --> 10:59.159
Yeah, okay.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.320
Great.

11:00.399 --> 11:04.080
I sent it to you guys.
-Oh, you did? -Yeah.

11:05.279 --> 11:07.600
So get your phones out.
-Did you email it? -Yeah.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.720
Okay.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.480
I'll read the stage directions.
-Great. -Okay.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.159
"He is sitting on the edge of the bed,
looking troubled,

11:16.360 --> 11:19.440
"she wakes up, confused,
and then realizes."

11:19.679 --> 11:21.159
I'm sorry, Tzutz, I'm sorry.

11:21.279 --> 11:23.720
What a disgusting feeling.
Like fucking a corpse.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.600
Why did you keep going
if you saw I was sleeping?

11:25.679 --> 11:27.480
I didn't notice you were sleeping.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.480
Oh my god,
she fell asleep while they were fucking.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.679
Come on...

11:33.000 --> 11:34.279
I didn't notice you were sleeping.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.000
I didn't notice we were fucking.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.240
"Silence."

11:38.279 --> 11:40.480
Didn't it seem odd
that I was silent?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.240
I thought you were concentrating.

11:42.279 --> 11:43.480
When did you realize?

11:43.519 --> 11:45.480
When I saw you drooling

11:45.559 --> 11:47.679
I started to piece it together.

11:48.039 --> 11:49.080
Oh my god...

11:50.639 --> 11:53.120
Iris, this is a scene I want to do.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.320
Good. Keep going.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.279
I don't see what's so funny.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.080
Admit that it's a little funny.
-It's not funny, it's insulting.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.320
How could you not wake up?
-I must be really tired.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.240
Tired? It's 9 pm.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.279
Then let's try again, Tzutz.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.159
No! No!

12:08.360 --> 12:10.240
How could you fall asleep?
-Honestly?

12:10.279 --> 12:12.320
Yes.
-I was bored.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.679
Excuse me?

12:16.080 --> 12:18.000
I was bored, Tzutz, bored.

12:18.519 --> 12:20.159
Oh, I see,
so you want me to ask you

12:20.279 --> 12:23.480
trivia questions while we're having sex?
-Okay, thanks.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.000
Wait, we're not done.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.279
I'm not too crazy about it.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.720
Seriously?
-It's awesome.

12:31.279 --> 12:35.080
Look at the boss,
we need to call an ambulance.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.480
I think it's very crude.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.159
It's not refined,
there's no subtext,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.120
it's primitive,
it's like a comedy skit.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.679
Sorry, but it's a comedy skit.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.159
But with an edge.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.559
Okay, I don't...

12:49.080 --> 12:50.320
It's not credible either.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.679
Oh, it isn't?
-No, it isn't.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.000
The audience wouldn't believe
it actually happened to someone.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.399
But it's funny.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.600
Not to everyone.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.080
How can I direct an actress
to do that?

13:03.159 --> 13:05.679
She fell asleep in the middle?
What is she, narcoleptic?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.000
She was bored,
he doesn't know how to touch her.

13:11.080 --> 13:11.720
Fine.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.320
I can't work like this,
on the spot,

13:14.519 --> 13:17.080
suddenly changing the scene,
so we'll see...

13:17.279 --> 13:18.320
Okay.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.960
Olga says now is a good time.

13:21.039 --> 13:23.320
Yes, yes, yes.
-Is it that urgent?

13:23.360 --> 13:24.679
Yes, she and Alex are leaving soon.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.440
Tomer, it's killing me
and I can't...

13:27.480 --> 13:30.080
Come on, Ofer, let's go.
-It's driving me nuts.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.080
I'm just making a call.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.159
One minute with my mom.

13:47.039 --> 13:50.320
Groshovsky's assistant,
what's her name, Masha?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.399
Groshovsky's assistant?
I think it's Kasha.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.679
Kasha, that's right.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.159
Go out with her.
-Listen, I don't feel like...

13:58.279 --> 13:59.639
No, no, I know, I know,

13:59.679 --> 14:01.679
but I'm telling you,
go out with her. -Fine.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.639
She's your woman.

14:02.679 --> 14:05.639
Don't tell me what to do, okay?
-No, really,

14:05.679 --> 14:07.240
she's...

14:07.360 --> 14:09.279
Fine.
-She's so right for you.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.639
I bet she has the wingspan of...

14:12.679 --> 14:14.320
What wingspan?
-A vulture.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.000
Wingspan, what nonsense...

14:17.080 --> 14:18.600
You don't even know her,
why are you...

14:18.679 --> 14:20.240
She'll take you
around the world

14:20.279 --> 14:21.440
you'll work
with Groshovsky

14:21.480 --> 14:23.679
and you'll see theater, talk theater...
-I got it.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.960
And you'll do theater...
-I got it. Hey.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.279
When did you write this?
-What?

14:29.159 --> 14:32.279
When did you write this scene?
The night it happened?

14:32.440 --> 14:35.480
A minute after I left?
-No, I threw up after you left.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.679
I wrote it.
Does it matter when?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.159
Don't pull these tricks on me, okay?

14:40.279 --> 14:42.279
I'm not pulling any tricks on you.
-Oh yeah?

14:43.320 --> 14:45.480
So you got bored?

14:45.679 --> 14:47.000
Let's say the sex

14:47.080 --> 14:49.000
wasn't the reason
I fell in love with you.

14:51.679 --> 14:52.639
Tomer.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.120
Tomer.

14:56.159 --> 14:57.080
Tomer.

14:57.679 --> 15:01.480
I'm sorry for laughing before,

15:01.559 --> 15:04.080
sometimes laughter is the way
I react to stress.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.279
It was unprofessional.
-It's okay.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.320
Olga said he'll be back in a jiffy.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.159
I'll be back
in a few minutes, okay?

15:18.279 --> 15:19.320
Too tight?

15:21.039 --> 15:22.120
Yeah, it's still too tight.

15:23.679 --> 15:26.159
It's not too tight,
you could fit a chicken in here.

15:26.679 --> 15:29.080
Hi.
-It's too tight.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.600
Don't worry, they'll fix it for you.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.480
Listen, Ofer,

15:32.639 --> 15:34.320
can you help me...

15:34.720 --> 15:36.320
can you help me get into...

15:36.480 --> 15:38.279
Tinder?
-Tinder?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.720
What do you need Tinder for?
-I just do.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.720
And I heard it's all dick-pics there,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.639
so I thought I'd ask the expert.

15:49.159 --> 15:51.320
You deleted that picture, right?

15:51.399 --> 15:54.679
No, I had it blown up into a poster
and hung it over my bed.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.960
Of course I deleted it.
-What style...

15:57.039 --> 15:59.000
But will you help me out?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.159
Look at this.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.159
Check out this style.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.320
I love this stuff.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.440
It's a period piece.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.320
Mark my word,

16:10.360 --> 16:11.720
if I go outside wearing this,

16:12.039 --> 16:13.320
I'll bring it back into fashion.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.679
If anyone could bring that thing
back into fashion

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
it's you, definitely.
-I'm not kidding.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.320
But can you help me, Ofer,
with the...

16:22.320 --> 16:23.279
what I asked you?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.559
It's embarrassing, yes or no?

16:25.639 --> 16:27.120
What do you need Tinder for?

16:27.200 --> 16:28.159
It's Sodom and Gomorrah!

16:28.240 --> 16:30.639
Why are you yelling?
-You'll meet a nice guy

16:30.679 --> 16:33.679
that's your type...
-I don't have a type,

16:33.720 --> 16:35.399
Who am I supposed to go out with?
You? -Fine.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.679
At least if you're joining,
it'll be under

16:37.960 --> 16:40.120
professional supervision.
-Okay.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.679
Look, I managed to download it.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.080
Good for you!

16:44.200 --> 16:46.960
You should change careers to tech.
-Fine.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.399
There's just one thing
I don't understand, okay?

16:49.480 --> 16:50.679
You go like this,

16:51.120 --> 16:53.080
what if there's
someone who loves me?

16:53.159 --> 16:54.720
Where does he write to me?
-No, no one here...

16:55.080 --> 16:57.279
"loves you," okay?
-Okay.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.279
There's a picture of a guy here
in the middle. -Yeah?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.440
If you feel like

17:02.200 --> 17:04.119
lying on him,
you swipe to the right,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.160
if you don't, swipe to the left.
-Okay,

17:06.279 --> 17:07.160
wait, wait.
-Why "wait, wait"?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.160
No, no, no, it's simple, don't stress out.
-Okay.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.480
Now what happens if...
-Yeah?

17:11.599 --> 17:13.000
Let's say I want someone,

17:13.319 --> 17:16.319
but he wants me at the same time.
Where does it say that?

17:16.400 --> 17:21.599
If that happens, a messenger
will show up at your door

17:22.279 --> 17:24.240
from Tinder International

17:24.359 --> 17:27.480
with trumpets and a bouquet,
and they throw you a party too.

17:27.559 --> 17:29.480
Okay.
Where does it say that?

17:29.640 --> 17:32.000
I didn't see.
-They'll notify you, you'll know.

17:32.079 --> 17:34.440
All right.
-Okay. Not him, not him, ew...

17:34.480 --> 17:36.559
Why not him?
-Seriously?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.440
As soon as he'd start talking,

17:38.480 --> 17:40.160
you'd fall asleep.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.079
Although you can fall asleep
in all kinds of situations.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.680
You think that's me in the scene?
-No.

17:46.079 --> 17:47.319
You really think so?

17:47.359 --> 17:49.319
No, it's not you.
-You think it's a documentary?

17:49.400 --> 17:52.119
It's all from inspiration.
You're Shakespeare. -Okay.

17:52.359 --> 17:54.680
Stand here for a sec,
I'll take your picture.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.480
Just take it like this, I'm natural.
-Seriously, natural?

17:57.640 --> 17:59.319
Take that ridiculous thing off.

17:59.640 --> 18:00.640
Take that pencil out.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.279
Let your hair down...

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
Well?

18:05.359 --> 18:07.319
Well?
-I love curls.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.160
Wait, this right here.

18:11.079 --> 18:13.480
Wait, it's nice when it's like this.
-Stop it.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.319
And a little...

18:19.160 --> 18:20.079
Wait.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
Put on something.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.480
Let's find something cool.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.480
This?

18:26.519 --> 18:28.000
That's awesome.
-Yeah?

18:28.079 --> 18:29.119
This is me.
-I woke up

18:29.200 --> 18:31.000
and just threw this on.
-Yes, this is me.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.400
Put that hat on.

18:32.519 --> 18:35.559
Oh, yes. -You have to.
-Won't work without the hat.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.319
Nice.
Lift it up a little.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.640
Just a little.
-That's the problem?

18:41.680 --> 18:44.599
Your phone's ringing.

18:47.119 --> 18:51.319
Mom, I need the house
to myself tonight.

18:51.359 --> 18:54.000
What don't you understand?
Can you guys clear out?

18:54.240 --> 18:57.160
Because I...
Because I need you to.

18:57.559 --> 18:58.960
What's the big deal?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
Fine, never mind.
Okay, okay.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.000
I heard you, thanks, bye.
Seriously...

19:16.039 --> 19:18.480
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Excuse me. -Sure.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.279
Excuse me.

19:28.279 --> 19:29.960
Listen, I...

19:30.480 --> 19:31.400
I need the...

19:31.480 --> 19:33.319
apartment today for a couple hours.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.079
What do you mean?

19:36.039 --> 19:37.279
I...

19:38.680 --> 19:40.960
I want to take a few things,

19:42.960 --> 19:45.319
a few boxes and some other stuff

19:45.400 --> 19:48.079
and I want to do it quietly,
on my own.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.000
Have you found an apartment?
-I think so, yes.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.000
Congratulations.
-Thanks.

19:55.079 --> 19:59.440
I don't want it to be dramatic,
so I'd rather be alone.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.160
It'll be dramatic if I'm there?
-Yes, yes.

20:02.279 --> 20:04.319
It'll provoke all kinds of reactions,

20:04.440 --> 20:07.000
I'm not up for it. Okay?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.680
It's my house too and...

20:09.359 --> 20:11.480
I feel it's my right.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.079
It's still my apartment too
and I pay rent

20:14.440 --> 20:17.599
and there are a few checks that I...
-So now we're talking checks?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.960
Just say that you want the checks.
-I'm just saying

20:20.039 --> 20:23.440
that I deserve to get my things
in peace and quiet.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.279
I need two hours,
I'll move everything out.

20:26.119 --> 20:27.279
No problem.

20:30.079 --> 20:31.319
It's good timing, because

20:31.440 --> 20:33.160
I may not be sleeping at home tonight.

20:34.079 --> 20:34.960
Great.

20:35.319 --> 20:36.319
Because I'm going out.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.079
Good for you.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.480
Is that it? -Yes.
-Thank you.

20:43.119 --> 20:45.079
Did she fix it?
Are you coming back?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.640
I think so.
-Good.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.160
Then go back to rehearsal.
Thanks.

20:50.599 --> 20:53.960
What's wrong? -Get me a date
with him for tonight.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.279
Tinder notified me that he's into me too.
-Really?

20:57.599 --> 20:59.599
Fix me up.
-It's not a good idea.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.079
He doesn't look like...
-Write to him.

21:03.000 --> 21:03.640
For tonight.

21:05.359 --> 21:06.240
Maya.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.119
Okay, come on.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.079
Let's try working
on the scene that Iris wrote.

21:16.319 --> 21:17.599
If you like it, I'm all for it.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.680
Maybe we can get something
out of it that has some... value.

21:21.279 --> 21:24.319
Let's do the text, please.
Maya?

21:25.599 --> 21:27.640
Maya?
-Yeah, sorry.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.160
I'm sorry, Tzutz, I'm sorry.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.480
What a disgusting feeling.
Like fucking a corpse.

21:32.599 --> 21:34.480
Why did you keep going
if you saw I was sleeping?

21:34.559 --> 21:35.680
I didn't notice you were sleeping.

21:36.039 --> 21:37.319
Wait, stop for a second.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.000
I feel like there's some tension
between you two.

21:41.079 --> 21:42.480
Yeah, we...

21:44.039 --> 21:46.240
We had a little fight, but...

21:46.400 --> 21:48.440
I apologized.
-It's not because of that.

21:50.319 --> 21:52.000
Let's try something for a minute.

21:52.079 --> 21:53.240
Put your pages down,

21:53.279 --> 21:54.480
I want to try something.
-Tomer, I'm okay...

21:54.559 --> 21:56.000
No, no, no,

21:56.079 --> 21:56.680
this is a good opportunity,

21:56.720 --> 22:00.319
this play depends on
the dynamics between you, okay?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.400
We keep saying,
"This is a play about a couple."

22:02.599 --> 22:04.319
What's a couple?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.079
It's this, right?

22:07.119 --> 22:09.319
It's someone who can
make you explode in an instant,

22:09.359 --> 22:10.960
someone who can turn you on or off

22:11.119 --> 22:12.480
with one look.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.279
Hm?

22:15.519 --> 22:16.720
Ofer?

22:17.400 --> 22:18.720
Is there love in your life?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.079
It's complicated.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.240
Okay, let's...

22:22.319 --> 22:23.400
Let's go in a different direction.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.319
Okay.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.000
Ofer, who do you love more,

22:28.079 --> 22:29.279
your mom or your dad?

22:30.319 --> 22:31.160
Answer fast.

22:32.039 --> 22:33.319
What?
-Mom or dad?

22:35.279 --> 22:37.640
None of them...
-No, you gotta choose one.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.079
Well?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.119
Mom.
-Okay, I'm your dad.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.000
Ofer, why did you say
you love Mom more than me?

22:44.240 --> 22:47.480
What? -Why did you say
you love Mom more than me, Ofer?

22:48.480 --> 22:50.319
Uh...
-Uh? Why did you say it?

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
Listen, Tomer, this is too...
-No, what are you afraid of?

22:52.480 --> 22:54.559
Why did you say it?
Don't you love me?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.480
He knows very well why.
-I don't know, I want you to tell me,

22:57.519 --> 22:59.720
why did you say it?
You're ungrateful!

23:00.000 --> 23:01.119
Don't you love me?

23:01.200 --> 23:03.319
Because you're a shitty dad!
-Why am I a shitty dad?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.440
You know very well
why you're a shitty dad!

23:05.480 --> 23:06.599
I don't know why
I'm a shitty dad,

23:06.680 --> 23:07.960
I want you to tell me why.

23:08.039 --> 23:09.599
Because you don't give
a fuck about us!

23:09.680 --> 23:12.640
And you're a stinking liar,
you left Mom without a dime

23:12.960 --> 23:14.960
and you fucked Aunt Rivi
behind her back.

23:15.079 --> 23:16.440
Okay, stop.

23:19.039 --> 23:20.000
Okay, don't continue.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.240
I'm sorry.
-Okay.

23:23.559 --> 23:25.319
That's what I'm talking about, okay?

23:25.680 --> 23:29.079
That's it, no less.
-Wow. -Okay, guys? That's it.

23:29.359 --> 23:31.440
What do you mean,
that's it?

23:31.480 --> 23:34.319
If you get mad at her
for falling asleep during sex

23:34.359 --> 23:36.279
like you're mad at your dad,

23:36.319 --> 23:38.640
then the scene will start working.
-That's intense.

23:39.039 --> 23:41.680
This is only where we start acting.

23:44.519 --> 23:46.480
That was an insane exercise.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.640
Good.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.319
Maya. -No, Tomer.
-Yes.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.680
Do it, it's intense.
-I did it 1,000 times

23:53.960 --> 23:55.720
at acting school, no.
-Hold on, okay,

23:56.000 --> 23:56.680
let's try something else.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.559
Let's just try to direct the scene, okay?
-This is how I direct, okay?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.640
This is how I direct, okay?

24:01.680 --> 24:04.480
Please, all sarcasm aside, okay?

24:04.960 --> 24:06.319
Stand up for a sec.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.240
Face each other.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.440
Maya, look at Ofer, okay?
Breathe,

24:15.119 --> 24:18.000
breathe deeply,
through your mouth.

24:26.279 --> 24:28.000
Okay.

24:28.279 --> 24:30.240
You're getting married soon, right?

24:31.359 --> 24:33.599
So?
-What's your boyfriend's name?

24:36.440 --> 24:37.319
Reut.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.319
Did you say his name is Reut?
-He's from up north. -Okay, Reut.

24:42.039 --> 24:44.480
You look at Ofer
and all you see is Reut.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.480
Now think...

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
if you think he's beautiful,

24:50.680 --> 24:53.400
try to think about
where you first met,

24:55.319 --> 24:57.240
where your first kiss was,

25:01.319 --> 25:03.319
where he proposed to you.

25:08.319 --> 25:10.480
How did you feel
when he proposed?

25:13.400 --> 25:15.480
What will it be like
to be married to him?

25:16.119 --> 25:17.319
Will it be different?

25:18.519 --> 25:20.400
Or do you already know
everything about him?

25:22.279 --> 25:24.960
Is there something
you never told him?

25:32.119 --> 25:34.160
Okay, text.
Right now. Text.

25:39.279 --> 25:41.079
I'm sorry, Tzutz.

25:42.599 --> 25:44.119
Again.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.160
I'm sorry, Tzutz, I'm sorry.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.319
Enough, Tomer,
I don't like these exercises.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.680
Psshhh...

26:11.200 --> 26:12.279
Did you see that?

26:13.359 --> 26:15.599
That was insane.
-That's it.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.440
What an amazing exercise.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.319
Good. Good.

26:21.599 --> 26:22.680
Great work.

26:31.279 --> 26:32.279
Hey.

26:33.519 --> 26:36.000
Buddha, I love you,
you know that?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.319
Is something wrong?

26:39.319 --> 26:41.000
No, nothing's wrong.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.480
I just want you to know
you're the best boyfriend I could ask for.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.480
Don't freak out.

26:51.519 --> 26:53.079
I'm not, babe.

26:54.079 --> 26:57.000
We just did this exercise
and I'm feeling overwhelmed.

27:02.519 --> 27:04.559
Oh my god, I'm...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.680
I'm so lucky.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.160
Thank you for allowing me to be me.

27:13.279 --> 27:16.680
I wouldn't change anything about you,
you're perfect for me, Buddha.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.480
You're my other half.

27:28.319 --> 27:30.279
Thank you,

27:30.559 --> 27:33.000
thank you for being you.

27:34.079 --> 27:35.559
You're so amazing,

27:35.640 --> 27:37.319
you're God-sent.

27:42.359 --> 27:43.680
See you at home.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.640
Okay, babe. I'll turn on
the water heater for you.

28:22.319 --> 28:24.559
Aren't you afraid
to live in this neighborhood?

28:26.680 --> 28:29.960
I'm afraid of all kinds of things,
but not of this neighborhood.

28:30.039 --> 28:31.480
Then what are you afraid of?

28:32.480 --> 28:35.559
All kinds of things,
I'm afraid of wrinkles,

28:37.039 --> 28:38.000
of old age,

28:38.559 --> 28:40.440
of being stuck.
-Oh.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.000
Boredom.
-That's heavy stuff.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.160
I meant foreign workers
and stuff like that.

28:55.519 --> 28:57.319
Listen, this isn't going to work.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.279
I have to be honest with you.
-Okay, why not?

29:03.000 --> 29:06.279
Because this is
a rebound date for me.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.559
I'm just coming out of a breakup

29:10.640 --> 29:12.160
and I think that I'm

29:12.480 --> 29:15.079
still totally in love with my ex.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.160
Okay.

29:18.279 --> 29:20.279
I don't have a problem with that.
-What do you mean?

29:21.319 --> 29:24.279
I'm not into you either,
so it doesn't offend me.

29:24.480 --> 29:27.319
What I mean is,
I wouldn't fall in love with you.

29:28.079 --> 29:31.079
Is it okay that I said that?
-Of course.

29:31.359 --> 29:33.599
You're the one who started
speaking openly, so I...

29:41.039 --> 29:42.160
Just out of curiosity,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.440
why are you so sure
you wouldn't fall in love with me?

29:45.200 --> 29:49.079
Forget it...
-No, why? I'm interested.

29:49.519 --> 29:51.079
You're not my style.

29:51.119 --> 29:53.559
I don't like your dress.
-My dress?

29:54.160 --> 29:57.000
You call that festive?
-This is vintage, it's a piece.

29:57.279 --> 29:58.720
Looks like it's second-hand.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.680
It is second-hand.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.160
That's what I meant.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.640
Why, you think
you could fall in love with me?

30:07.039 --> 30:09.279
Take a good look,
then decide.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.319
No, I don't think
I could fall in love with you.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.400
There you go.
We're even.

30:22.519 --> 30:26.160
I don't get it, why did you want
to go on this date?

30:27.359 --> 30:29.279
Because I wanted to kiss someone.

30:31.200 --> 30:35.319
I don't get it.
-I wanted to kiss someone.

30:35.359 --> 30:37.160
But you said you just
got out of a relationship.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.240
Yeah, but when was the last time
I kissed him?

30:39.279 --> 30:42.319
A real kiss...

30:42.359 --> 30:43.480
when? About...

30:43.720 --> 30:46.480
four years ago.
And on dates people usually kiss

30:46.559 --> 30:48.000
and I wanted to kiss someone.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.000
Okay.

30:51.079 --> 30:54.160
So that's the reason...
That's the reason.

30:54.279 --> 30:55.319
Okay.

30:57.599 --> 30:58.720
Then let's kiss.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.720
Thanks, but I don't think so.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.680
Listen, Miss Vintage,

31:05.279 --> 31:07.400
I understand I'm not cultured enough
for you

31:07.480 --> 31:10.680
because I don't want to live with
Eritreans and Ethiopians, fine.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.319
But I know how to kiss.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.279
That's great, but I don't think so.

31:15.319 --> 31:18.000
You wanted to go on a date
so you could kiss someone, right?

31:18.079 --> 31:19.079
Then let's kiss.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.680
At least you'll get something
out of it.

31:23.319 --> 31:24.559
Okay, let's do it.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.160
Okay, let's do it.
-Across the table?

31:27.240 --> 31:29.119
No, no, no, I'll...

31:32.119 --> 31:33.000
Um...

31:34.359 --> 31:36.720
Any instructions,
for the kiss?

31:39.400 --> 31:43.000
Not too wet, if possible.
-Of course, of course.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.480
Okay.

31:45.039 --> 31:46.559
I'm traditional, by the way.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.960
You mean, the way you kiss?

31:49.039 --> 31:52.319
No, I come from a traditional family.
-Does that have anything to do with this?

31:52.440 --> 31:55.640
No.
-Oh, just generally... Okay.

32:27.519 --> 32:28.960
That was...

32:29.039 --> 32:31.160
This was good, wasn't it?

32:32.599 --> 32:34.160
Yeah, it was fun.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.079
You have quite a technique there.
-Yeah.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.680
Thanks.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.480
Cheers.

33:05.480 --> 33:11.000
Tomer, it's you and... her,
the one from the theater. -What?

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
You're a couple?

33:14.319 --> 33:19.319
Oh, no, no, no, it's...
This is from a long, long time ago, we...

33:22.480 --> 33:24.599
It's just, we work together...
-Okay, Tomer, Tomer.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.720
But there's nothing between us now.
-Tomer, Tomer,

33:28.000 --> 33:28.960
I don't care.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.960
Okay. -I don't care.
You can be whoever you want to be.

33:33.119 --> 33:35.640
Okay.
-I just came here to have fun with you,

33:36.480 --> 33:41.160
and then maybe to miss you.
A little bit. -Okay.

33:43.039 --> 33:44.319
You like to miss?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.960
Um-hum.
-Um-hum.

33:48.319 --> 33:49.680
Yeah.
-Yes.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.480
Mom,

34:14.280 --> 34:16.159
can I come sleep over tonight?

34:18.239 --> 34:21.000
I think Tomer's fucking someone
in our apartment.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.320
Thanks.
