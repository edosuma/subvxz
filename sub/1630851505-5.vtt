00:05.135 --> 00:06.702
<i>Previously on</i> Vegas...

00:06.745 --> 00:08.617
This is rented to a Mr. Hodges.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
It's like his own little lab
to fake evidence.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.924
Hodges didn't do this.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.317
<i>Someone just made it look
like he did.</i>

00:13.361 --> 00:15.798
Let's go deeper in the DNA.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.366
Our man looks to be of
South American descent.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.368
Nora is with
Internal Affairs.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.196
I'm gonna interview
a few folks around here.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.850
That is your
- signature, correct?
<i>She holds</i>

00:24.894 --> 00:26.678
- her cards close to the vest.
- She's gonna give you a peek

00:26.722 --> 00:28.811
<i>at the evidence
so you can narrow down</i>

00:28.854 --> 00:30.639
<i>our list of suspects.</i>

00:30.682 --> 00:32.728
- You know who did it.
Only one
of our suspects

00:32.771 --> 00:33.859
has the skills
to do what I saw.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.993
♪ Bah-bah, bah-bah

00:37.037 --> 00:39.517
♪ Bah-bah, bah,
bah-bah-bah, bah-bah ♪

00:39.561 --> 00:41.867
♪ Bah-bah, bah-bah...

00:41.911 --> 00:45.175
Boomerang 8-7,
this is Vegas tower. Come in.

00:46.481 --> 00:49.919
Boomerang 8-7,
this is Vegas tower. Come in.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.531
Boomerang 8-7,
tell me you read me.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.751
We are starting
to worry down here.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.847
- What's the call?
- Tower can't raise
a cargo plane

01:04.890 --> 01:06.196
lining up for runway four.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.589
All security vehicles

01:07.632 --> 01:09.025
to runway four.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.505
All security vehicles
to runway four.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.028
Homeland Security
thinks we got a hostage

01:12.072 --> 01:14.117
situation or a kamikaze,
so get us to four now.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.076
Let's go!

01:38.359 --> 01:39.969
Eyes on aft compartment.

01:40.012 --> 01:43.842
Guns up on that cargo door,
stack behind me.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.193
Stand by for
plug door breach.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.282
Breeching.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.508
That's our man.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.858
Martin Kline. You two believe

01:59.902 --> 02:02.296
this guy framed David Hodges,

02:02.339 --> 02:04.689
He wanted him to look
like a rogue lab tech.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.518
- It's a theory.
- So is evolution.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.173
Kline matches the phenotype of
the man that we're looking for.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
And he has the technical skills

02:12.262 --> 02:13.829
to pull it off.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.396
He's a former medical examiner.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.006
These days,
Kline makes his living

02:17.049 --> 02:19.487
as an expert witness,
same as Hodges.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.706
So 8,000 criminals
could get sprung

02:21.750 --> 02:23.447
because of what
this guy did. Why?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.232
He got a bone to pick with
the criminal justice system?

02:25.275 --> 02:27.234
Oh, he's picked
a lot of bones.

02:27.277 --> 02:30.150
That's part of the reason we
think he deserves a closer look.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.239
Okay, I haven't had
my coffee yet.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.197
Can we not speak in riddles?

02:34.241 --> 02:38.767
Detective Cross showed me a case
that Hodges supposedly fixed.

02:38.810 --> 02:42.205
It hinges on a piece
of broken femur, leached of DNA.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.946
We had ten suspects.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.427
Kline is the only one
that would know how to do that.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.603
But he had to get that
femur from somewhere.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.388
Kline conducts
private autopsies.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.085
I think swiping parts

02:53.129 --> 02:55.305
from corpses
is generally frowned upon.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.785
The man may have
sent somebody

02:56.828 --> 02:58.700
to kill Jim Brass
just to get our attention.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.876
I don't think
a frown's gonna stop him.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.358
There's a problem
at the airport.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.533
I like where
you two are headed

03:05.576 --> 03:06.969
on this, but IAB has still

03:07.012 --> 03:08.362
got its eyes on you.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.277
Keep flying
under the radar.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.764
Thanks.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.289
- Maxine.
- Marcus.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.900
Um, this is Allie Rajan
and Josh Folsom.

03:24.943 --> 03:28.295
Guys, this is
Special Agent Barron.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.253
Don't gamble with this guy.
He still owes me a drink.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.256
What's it been--
- three years?
- Yeah.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.737
When we call in the local
geek squad, it's a mixed bag,

03:35.780 --> 03:37.304
but looks like I hit
the jackpot in Vegas.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.044
Good thing, too.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.481
We really need all the help
we can get on this one.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.091
All right, tell us.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.962
So this cargo plane is
inbound from Sonora, Mexico,

03:44.006 --> 03:45.573
radio silent on approach.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.749
Homeland Security goes
full tilt freak-out,

03:47.792 --> 03:50.404
but the plane
lands autonomously, no incident.

03:50.447 --> 03:51.883
The plane landed itself?

03:51.927 --> 03:53.320
Modern flight systems
can communicate

03:53.363 --> 03:55.322
with the magnetic sensors
in the runway.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.149
Everything's automated.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.021
Lucky thing, too.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.113
What the hell
happened up there?

04:04.156 --> 04:06.158
That's the question.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.813
Unfortunately, there's
nobody alive to answer it.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.815
I wouldn't say that.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.078
You asked us.

04:20.129 --> 04:23.306
♪ Who... are you?

04:23.350 --> 04:26.309

04:54.511 --> 04:56.470
Careful, Maverick.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.949
Do you want to fly, Goose?

04:57.993 --> 04:59.342
I'd rather get in there.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.257
We'd have to take
these pictures first anyway.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.085
At least now we're not
tromping over all the evidence.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.478
Not all the evidence.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.263
There's blood
on the ceiling.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.134
Cast-off or arterial spray?

05:09.178 --> 05:13.051
Could be either.
Two of 'em got it in the neck.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.314
From a fire safety ax,
looks like.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.706
Ugh.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.969
That thing is coated.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.841
Can't say I'm optimistic
about prints.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.409
Great. We got <i>The Shining
at 30,000 feet,</i>

05:22.452 --> 05:25.368
and no easy way to know
- who did the chopping.
- Hmm.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.804
What do you think?

05:26.848 --> 05:28.284
Somebody went nuts
with the ax,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.547
victim got ahold of it
and fought back?

05:30.591 --> 05:32.854
That'd be my guess.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.467
I don't want
to guess, Chris.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.556
I want to know.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.517
That's Captain Eduardo Reyes.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.041
The first officer, Mike Conroy.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.784
That's Ellis Truette.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.568
He subs for us sometimes.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.614
Wasn't on the schedule.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.877
- He must've been deadheading.
- What?

05:55.920 --> 05:59.010
Uh, sitting jump seat,
hitching a ride home.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.621
Our pilots do it all the time.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.144
Is there anything
on the black box?

06:02.187 --> 06:04.015
No. Someone pulled
the fuse.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.496
Mr. Watkins,
can you think of any reason

06:06.540 --> 06:08.846
why one of those pilots
would do something like this?

06:08.890 --> 06:10.892
No. No. No idea.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.416
These are good men, family men,
been with our company for years.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.418
Hell, Captain Reyes is a hero.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.377
When he flew civilian,

06:17.420 --> 06:20.423
he landed a 767
that lost an engine.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.643
He-he saved 200 lives.

06:24.819 --> 06:28.300
That's his wife. Um...

06:28.344 --> 06:29.867
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

06:30.868 --> 06:34.916
Yeah.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.614
So, I was, um... I was
surprised to see you.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.748
I... I heard you were
based in Atlanta.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.403
Were you checking up on me?

06:43.446 --> 06:47.407
I, uh, cleared a couple
of FAA cases.

06:47.450 --> 06:51.323
I sort of became Agent Airplane
for the Bureau.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.934
Now they send me all over.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.066
Do CSIs have specialties
like that?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.242
I'm genetics and kinesiology.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.854
- Kind of like body language?
- Kind of.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.899
You lost your wedding ring.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.814
- Mm-hmm.
- Good. I never liked
your husband.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.903
You never met my ex.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.487
What are you
looking at?

07:24.531 --> 07:27.055
A lot of Type A negative,
Type O

07:27.098 --> 07:28.535
and B positive.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.406
Reyes, Conroy, Truette.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.495
How about all the rest?

07:32.539 --> 07:34.932
That's the question.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.934
Once we find out who bled where,

07:36.978 --> 07:38.849
might be able to say
who killed who.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.416
We're gonna be
blood-type testing

07:40.460 --> 07:42.810
for the rest of
our natural lives.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.382
I called the coroner's
office to check which cases

07:50.426 --> 07:52.472
Kline's consulted
on lately.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.822
Here we go.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.433
Riley Jones, traffic fatality.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.435
CSI deemed it an accident.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.091
Martin Kline
conducted a second autopsy

08:03.134 --> 08:04.962
at the request of the family
two months ago.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.921
That sounds benign.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.444
Kline's done two autopsies
this year.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.141
The first was interred
at a mausoleum.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.883
That wouldn't be my choice
if I was a bone thief.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.885
Ms. Jones here
is a better bet.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.715
Her family donated her body
to science. You see that?

08:21.762 --> 08:24.547
Oh. Good.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.854
We get to go to the body farm.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.553
<i>Type A.</i>

08:30.597 --> 08:34.078
Sample 134 is more
from Captain Reyes.

08:36.341 --> 08:39.344
Hello? Let's hear some chatter
down there, team.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.346
How about some
"Never Have I Ever"?

08:41.390 --> 08:43.044
What?

08:43.087 --> 08:45.481
It's a drinking game.
You say something

08:45.525 --> 08:47.483
you've never done.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.268
And if the other person has,
they got to drink, or,

08:50.312 --> 08:52.749
you know, chart blood. So...

08:52.793 --> 08:55.752
Never have I ever...
been to England.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.449
Ugh.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.451
You got me there.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.498
Okay. Never have I ever...

09:02.542 --> 09:04.631
been to a football game.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.024
Football-football or soccer?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.070
- Both.
- Ugh.

09:09.113 --> 09:13.161
All right, all right,
never have I ever rapped

09:13.204 --> 09:15.206
in a middle school talent show.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.557
You showed him the video?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.297
♪ Uh, uh.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.822
All right, here's a real one.

09:21.865 --> 09:25.869
Never have I ever
seen an FBI agent

09:25.913 --> 09:27.567
more interested in our boss.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.569
You caught that, too, huh?

09:29.612 --> 09:32.136
Hey, seems like a good dude.
She should go for it.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.573
Are you mad?
That's a terrible idea.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.012
Well, just mixing
work and...

09:38.055 --> 09:40.492
Hmm. Never mind.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.195
All right, I'm done
on this quadrant.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.241
Ah.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.028
I'm not seeing any more
blood back here.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.339
Do you think someone forget
to fasten this crate?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.345
No. This strap got
the same treatment

10:07.389 --> 10:09.521
as those bodies up front.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.269
They were looking
for something.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.531
Mm-hmm.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.667
Do you think one of those guys
up there started snooping

10:24.711 --> 10:26.800
and got caught?

10:26.843 --> 10:29.019
Maybe this was
a heist gone wrong.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.848
Maybe it didn't
go wrong at all.

10:32.849 --> 10:36.244
Let's imagine that each
of these chips

10:36.287 --> 10:37.898
- is worth a $1,000.
- Why would we imagine that?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.551
Because $1,000 chips

10:39.595 --> 10:42.816
at the Zenith Casino
are the most valuable chips

10:42.859 --> 10:44.208
in Vegas

10:44.252 --> 10:46.254
without RFID tracking.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.299
So, they're untraceable.
Anyone could cash them in,

10:48.343 --> 10:49.997
a few at a time,
no questions asked?

10:50.040 --> 10:51.172
Yup.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
We found a cargo
crate on board

10:53.348 --> 10:54.958
that got tampered
with midflight.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.917
Checked the packages inside
against the manifest.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.440
Only one was missing.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.747
"

11:00.790 --> 11:02.444
Zenith Casino."

11:02.487 --> 11:05.839
This API box is the same size
as the one that disappeared

11:05.882 --> 11:08.276
from the plane.
Guess how many chips fit inside.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.408
Probably enough
to buy me a little lake house.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.759
Two million dollars' worth.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.283
All from a factory in Sonora.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.502
Two mil?

11:17.546 --> 11:19.679
Someone else must've been on the
plane. They killed three men,

11:19.722 --> 11:21.115
jumped out a
whole lot richer.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.421
But after he jumps,
how was the door closed?

11:23.465 --> 11:26.381
How was the cabin
repressurized? I think

11:26.424 --> 11:27.861
your theory might
have some holes.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.253
We got to play the hand
we're dealt.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.212
The killer left something
in that plane.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
We find it, we find them.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.969
Wonderful place you
have here, Dr. Abbas.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.928
- Thank you.
- I don't hear that a lot.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.365
Most people think
body farms are ghoulish.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.585
As if there's another way
to study decomposition.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.805
Ah, that smell.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.720
So many memories.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.246
I understand you're interested
in one of our bodies.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.639
What has you so curious
about Riley Jones?

12:07.683 --> 12:09.772
Well, we're not sure
you were given an intact corpse.

12:09.816 --> 12:13.428
Oh. Well, I'm sorry then.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.604
It might be too difficult
to tell at this point.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.781
Ms. Jones has Grid 17 here
all to herself,

12:18.825 --> 12:21.262
- so, here she is.
- Hmm.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.003
And there she is.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.874
And, well,
there's more over there, and,

12:24.918 --> 12:27.703
well, you're welcome
to whatever you can find.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.097
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

12:35.102 --> 12:40.237
Looks like a coyote
or something was here.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.283
Let's hope
there's enough bones left

12:42.326 --> 12:44.328
to tell if Dr. Kline
was the first scavenger

12:44.372 --> 12:45.808
to find Ms. Jones.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.550
Hey, Watson?

12:48.593 --> 12:51.335
The game's afoot.

12:53.642 --> 12:57.777
The human body is just
no match for a crash ax.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.430
Captain Reyes and
First Officer Conroy

12:59.474 --> 13:01.998
both died
of arterial hemorrhaging.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.481
23 lacerations and not
one defensive wound?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.007
Huh.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.749
None here, either.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.882
You'd think the second guy faced
with an ax-wielding maniac

13:15.925 --> 13:17.579
would maybe get
a hand up, no?

13:17.622 --> 13:19.755
Maybe they were already
incapacitated.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.671
Are these from
taser prongs?

13:22.714 --> 13:24.151
You mean
from a stun gun?

13:24.194 --> 13:25.892
That was my thinking.

13:27.284 --> 13:30.244
Puncture diameter
and depth are both consistent

13:30.287 --> 13:32.159
with taser prongs.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.336
Hold up. Tasers are packed
with AFID tags, AFIDs.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.990
<i>Numbered confetti
basically IDs the weapon.</i>

13:37.033 --> 13:38.730
<i>They blow out when fired.</i>

13:38.774 --> 13:41.168
- We didn't find any.
- True...

13:41.211 --> 13:43.910
but if the door was open
midflight for a thief to jump,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.564
there would have
been a vacuum.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.132
I mean, bodies are too heavy,
cargo was tied down.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.568
But any little
bit of paper--

13:50.612 --> 13:52.396
it would've been
sucked right out.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.877
Story gets a little more
complicated over here.

13:54.921 --> 13:58.446
Ellis Truette,
our jump seat rider.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.317
I looked him up.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.884
Poor guy's wife
died in childbirth.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.755
Sad stuff.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.366
His little
boy is eight.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.021
Anyway, Truette was
involved in the fight,

14:08.064 --> 14:11.372
but he wasn't tased, and he
didn't die like the other two.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.896
- How'd he die?
- Hypoxia.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.160
Pulmonary vasoconstriction and
alveolar hemorrhaging confirm.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.640
You think he was starved
from oxygen

14:18.683 --> 14:19.946
when the cabin
depressurized?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.208
So he was still alive when

14:21.251 --> 14:22.209
the killer jumped
out with the chips.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.211
Mm, not for long.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.734
Probably didn't help

14:25.777 --> 14:27.692
that his lung capacity
was already limited.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.914
Stage three or
four lung cancer.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.700
Everyone ends up in a room
like this sooner or later.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.965
For Mr. Truette, it wasn't
going to be much later.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.358
Truette wasn't tased.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.925
He wasn't nearly as hacked up.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.493
He was already dying
of terminal cancer.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.277
We sure he was an
innocent victim?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.279
You think he was
in on the heist?

14:49.323 --> 14:52.369
He could've snuck
a partner in crime on board,

14:52.413 --> 14:54.067
someone he shouldn't
have trusted.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.069
I mean, the man was about
to leave his kid fatherless.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.853
Maybe he didn't want
to leave him penniless, too.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.030
Is that what happened?

15:08.124 --> 15:09.517
<i>So your people have a hunch</i>

15:09.560 --> 15:11.519
this Truette guy
was in on it?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.216
My three least
favorite words

15:13.260 --> 15:15.218
are "coupon,"
"quinoa" and "hunch."

15:15.262 --> 15:18.004
I had Truette's luggage
sent up for analysis.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.659
Well, I think you can skip
the fancy science this time.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.488
You give me one good look
at someone's bag,

15:24.532 --> 15:26.708
I'll tell you 50 things
about them.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.977
50 things, huh? Go on.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.848
How about one?

15:37.980 --> 15:39.590
I bet he smuggled in

15:39.634 --> 15:41.157
his partner in here.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.247
They don't X-ray commercial
pilots' luggage in Mexico.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.729
- Boss?
- Yeah.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.731
Prelims came back
on the blood.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.603
212 samples-- all
from the decedents.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.432
If there was another passenger,
they didn't bleed on that plane.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.565
I think we can stop saying "if."

15:57.608 --> 15:59.523
This is a Trojan horse.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.873
You know what?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.745
I don't think we can learn
50 things about this guy,

16:03.788 --> 16:06.400
but I'd settle
for one or two.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.188
Only thing I see is residue
from a cleaning product.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.321
Even if it was just a baby wipe,

16:14.364 --> 16:17.672
we're probably out
of luck on DNA.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.283
What is that? Lint?
Here.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.422
I think it's one
of those stickers

16:28.465 --> 16:31.991
that they slap on your luggage
at the airport.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.167
Think that'll tell us
something, Agent Airplane?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.737
I'm impressed.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.957
You got all the broken
spinous processes in order.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.480
Well, we've had some practice.

16:43.524 --> 16:44.829
Yeah, I'm still
missing three bones.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.441
There's no left
true rib number four,

16:47.484 --> 16:48.746
right tibia
or right talus.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.140
A private autopsy was done

16:51.184 --> 16:53.882
by a man who may have
taken souvenirs.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.797
It wasn't Martin Kline, was it?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.668
What makes you
think that?

16:57.712 --> 17:00.106
The Nevada pathology community
is basically middle school.

17:00.149 --> 17:03.283
I mean, nobody wants to
sit at Marty's table.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.199
If I were to guess
who's a creepy bone thief...

17:06.242 --> 17:07.765
Well, that would be
a good guess.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.332
Let's have a look

17:09.376 --> 17:12.118
and see what the old weirdo
might have taken.

17:17.601 --> 17:21.997
Tibia and talus were on the menu
for a coyote, maybe a bobcat.

17:22.041 --> 17:26.045
Yeah, well, I think true rib
number four was removed by

17:26.088 --> 17:27.655
a different kind of animal.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.658
One with opposable thumbs,
perhaps?

17:35.010 --> 17:38.361
And a Stryker Autopsy Saw
with an oscillating tip.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.196
There you are.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.155
Sticker you found

17:49.198 --> 17:50.852
was from 2014.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.201
A flight Truette's
cousin was on.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.507
Check out my
man's sheet.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.943
Gary Hayworth.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.205
He's got sticky fingers.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.641
Yup, attached to
a wee little man.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.339
Five-two,
about a buck-25

17:59.382 --> 18:00.557
at his last booking.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.037
So he'd fit in
Truette's bag.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.430
Not only that.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.648
Last known address
is Truette's house.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.085
I guess they
live together.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.869
I mean, he'd have
to be a real dirtbag

18:07.912 --> 18:09.914
to kill his own cousin, but

18:09.958 --> 18:11.612
he does appear
to be a real dirtbag.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.310
I think he's about
to meet the FBI.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.198
They look good in
those windbreakers,

18:32.241 --> 18:34.678
but never would I ever.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.985
You know, what I was
starting to say the other day

18:37.028 --> 18:39.553
about, um, dating
someone from work?

18:39.596 --> 18:42.686
I just think it's a
recipe for disaster.

18:42.730 --> 18:46.342
Allie, the game is
"Never <i>Have</i> I Ever."

18:46.386 --> 18:49.563
It's not a list of things
you claim you wouldn't do.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.653
Oh.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.617
Hello, ma'am.
Agent Barron, FBI.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.097
I'm looking for
Gary Hayworth.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.187
Oh. I'm sorry. He's not here.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.842
Okay.

19:07.885 --> 19:10.061
Uh, do you...
you all want to come in?

19:10.105 --> 19:11.759
Yes, please.

19:11.802 --> 19:15.458
I haven't seen Gary in a while,
but I'm not always here.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.505
I'm one of the sitters
that takes care of Cole when...

19:18.548 --> 19:20.594
when Ellis was working.

19:21.812 --> 19:25.251
Look, I heard he's gonna have
to go to foster care now.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.384
- He in there now?
- Yeah.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.299
I took him for ice cream,
but it's not like

19:30.343 --> 19:31.909
much is gonna
cheer him up.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.261
He put himself in his room
when we got home.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.702
He's a really sweet kid. I...

19:41.745 --> 19:43.965
Any idea
when Gary was here last?

19:44.008 --> 19:45.488
He just comes and goes.

19:45.532 --> 19:46.881
I thought he lived here.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.752
No, I think he just stays
in the guest room

19:48.796 --> 19:51.233
when he needs a place to crash.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.670
I just haven't
seen him much lately,

19:53.714 --> 19:56.456
which is fine by me.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.806
- Not a fan?
- It's none of
my business,

19:58.849 --> 20:02.244
but I just never thought
that he was the best influence.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.508
House is clear.
Suspect's MIA.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.249
Thank you for
your cooperation.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.512
Of course.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.862
You find something that puts
Gary Hayworth on that plane

20:11.906 --> 20:14.865
or tells us where he is
now, Bureau's buying.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.789
I think he's guilty.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.922
Of dressing like
a roadie for Nickelback.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.794
Sloppy guy. What is that?

20:30.838 --> 20:33.057
I'm almost afraid to find out.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.277
But I will... just in case
he wore it on the plane.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.366
What have you got there?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.673
Truette's computer.
Check out the last site

20:39.716 --> 20:41.762
he visited.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.156
Ah.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.420
Currency exchange
- calculator.
- Who knew

20:47.463 --> 20:49.552
two million dollars turned
into so many Maldivian rufiyaa?

20:49.596 --> 20:52.033
Looks like
- our missing man Gary did.
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.879
Hey.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.621
I'm Josh.
You're Cole, right?

21:18.581 --> 21:20.366
What you got there?

21:23.369 --> 21:25.371
You get that from your dad?

21:25.414 --> 21:28.330
No, it's new. It was on my bed
when I got back from ice cream.

21:28.374 --> 21:32.334
Uncle Gary probably brought it
because he heard about Dad.

21:32.378 --> 21:35.163
You got that today?

21:35.206 --> 21:38.340
I knew my dad was sick, but
I didn't think he was gonna...

21:40.386 --> 21:42.953
Of course not.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.000
Why are all these
people here?

21:46.043 --> 21:49.177
Someone hurt your dad.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.613
Who?

21:50.657 --> 21:52.267
We don't know yet.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.834
Are you gonna catch him?

21:53.877 --> 21:56.880
Yes. I am.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.275
Hey,

22:00.319 --> 22:02.669
would it be all right
if I borrowed your snow globe?

22:02.712 --> 22:04.148
It might help.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.672
If it was magic, the person

22:05.715 --> 22:08.631
who did this would already be
in prison.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.764
He will be soon.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.334
Hey, it'll just be
for just a day or two.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.338
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna do my best.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.171
All right.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.579
We've got a killer in the wind
with two million dollars,

22:43.623 --> 22:45.755
and you're playing
with Silly Putty.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.236
Yeah, if there's a better way
to pull prints

22:48.279 --> 22:50.238
from a curved surface,

22:50.281 --> 22:52.806
well, you let me know.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.634
I'm trying to get Gary
in Truette's house

22:54.677 --> 22:56.070
after the crash.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.593
Well, that'll
shrink our radius.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.073
Any chance we got lucky,

22:59.116 --> 23:00.770
and those prints are
all airplane grease?

23:00.814 --> 23:03.991
We're not that lucky.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.215
Okay. I pulled
a half dozen prints.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.609
More art than
science, isn't it?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.176
It's art and science.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.615
Does that say "matches,"

23:19.659 --> 23:21.617
plural?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.706
Yeah, some of these are
Gary's, but, yup, looks like

23:23.750 --> 23:26.753
we got a second suspect
floating around Truette's world.

23:26.796 --> 23:29.277
Jenny Romero-- grand
larceny, grand theft auto.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.235
Wow. She's hardcore.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.933
And petite.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.935
She'd practically
fit in a knapsack.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.458
I'll put out a BOLO.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.808
You are good, Roby.

23:48.339 --> 23:51.125
Ms. Sidle?

23:52.387 --> 23:54.171
I'm sorry. Have we met?

23:54.215 --> 23:56.478
No, but we have
a mutual acquaintance.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.220
Dr. Abbas from the body farm.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.222
Right.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.919
And there is
your husband.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.835
Now we have the matched set.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.271
Everything all right here?

24:07.315 --> 24:08.925
Oh, absolutely.

24:08.969 --> 24:12.015
I just wanted to introduce
myself. I'm Martin Kline.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.629
I heard

24:16.672 --> 24:18.718
you were
double-checking my work.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.067
Don't worry.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.590
I'm not offended.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.113
Your reputation precedes you.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.288
I know all about
you, really.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.552
That's why I wanted to talk.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.814
About what?

24:27.857 --> 24:29.729
Riley Jones's cause of death.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.644
I'd love to see

24:31.687 --> 24:33.167
if we're all on the same page.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.996
Yeah, well,
I'd love to talk,

24:36.039 --> 24:38.085
but, uh, we're running late.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.696
We have to be somewhere,
meet somebody.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.611
Of course.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.526
Have a nice night.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.876
I'll come bother you
some other time.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.620
What the hell
was that about?

24:51.664 --> 24:53.143
Fishing expedition.

24:53.187 --> 24:54.667
He knows we're on to him.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.320
I don't think
he'll be back.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.105
He wouldn't want
to make us more suspicions.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.107
He's not going to leave us
anything to find, either.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.543
He'll scrub all of it.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.633
We can't hide
anymore, Gil.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.809
It's time to get a warrant.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.208
They know.

25:14.251 --> 25:17.951
Yeah. It's gonna have
to be dealt with.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.441
You won't go for
drinks last night,

25:30.485 --> 25:32.443
but you take me up for
coffee this morning.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.923
What am I missing, huh?

25:33.967 --> 25:36.186
I don't know. Boundaries?

25:36.230 --> 25:38.406
You are single.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.842
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.105
What happened there?

25:42.149 --> 25:44.368
I stopped making breakfast.

25:44.412 --> 25:46.893
Um, he stopped picking up
after himself.

25:46.936 --> 25:50.200
And we both gave a little less
every year

25:50.244 --> 25:52.202
until there was nothing left
between us.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.423
You ever think
about giving it one more shot?

25:55.466 --> 25:58.731
Something long-term?

25:58.774 --> 26:00.907
I'm married to my job.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.126
That's it for now.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.171
Yeah.

26:05.999 --> 26:09.437
Hey.
There's our buddy in the mirror.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.091
You recognize that guy?

26:15.182 --> 26:16.618
Is that Gary Hayworth?

26:16.662 --> 26:18.228
Mm-hmm.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.274
Here I thought we were
just grabbing breakfast.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.797
How'd you find him?

26:21.841 --> 26:23.669
It's called
"French fry forensics."

26:24.670 --> 26:26.585
Half of his shirts
all have the same stain.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.456
It's a mix of beef tallow
and starch,

26:28.499 --> 26:30.066
instead of cooking oil.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.112
We called all the places
on this side of town

26:32.155 --> 26:33.548
that did it
the old-fashioned way.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.984
He practically lives here.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.333
Sure looks like it.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.466
Who knew
carbs make such a great alibi?

26:38.509 --> 26:40.468
I doubt he could fit
in the same suitcase

26:40.511 --> 26:42.470
he could as a young man.

26:42.513 --> 26:43.906
He wasn't on that plane,

26:43.950 --> 26:46.126
but doesn't mean
he's not an accomplice.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.823
I didn't do anything.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.651
Okay, well, let's hear
about what you didn't do.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.653
You and your friend
Jenny Romero. Where is she?

26:51.697 --> 26:53.655
I don't know.
I don't know. Why?

26:53.699 --> 26:55.265
Because we're looking
for the person

26:55.309 --> 26:56.876
who killed two API pilots,
and double-crossed your cousin

26:56.919 --> 26:58.442
in the middle
of their heist.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
You seen any of
these recently?

27:00.140 --> 27:02.316
- Whole bunch of red ones?
- Wait. Are you trying to say

27:02.359 --> 27:04.318
Ellis robbed a casino?

27:04.361 --> 27:07.016
'Cause that's...
No. No way.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.410
And-and Jenny never even
met Ellis.

27:09.453 --> 27:12.065
Ooh. Careful. You don't
want to lie to the FBI.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.850
Her prints were
in his home.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.940
- On a snow globe.
- Well, yeah.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.595
of course they were.
She picked that up for me.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.292
The kid's dad
just died.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.468
I wanted Cole to know
someone still cared about him,

27:24.512 --> 27:26.340
so we left him a present.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.864
I'd like to ask her
to verify that story.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.953
Can you put us in touch?

27:30.997 --> 27:32.999
She's not answering my calls
today.

27:33.042 --> 27:36.829
I was not enthusiastic enough
about her new hairstyle.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.658
You see her,
you call me, hmm?

27:51.713 --> 27:54.716
I mean, it's really
dealer's choice, isn't it?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718
'Cause it's a few
different charges

27:56.762 --> 27:58.589
that might apply to
Dr. Kline stealing that bone.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.591
Destruction of evidence
would give us

28:00.635 --> 28:02.681
- the widest search parameters.
- Yeah.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.857
But that'll set off alarm bells
at the DA's office

28:04.900 --> 28:06.902
before it even
gets to the judge.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.599
You think the DA
would shut us down?

28:08.643 --> 28:10.253
I think the DA
is like every other lawyer.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.342
She doesn't even want
to know our investigation exists

28:12.386 --> 28:14.344
until we're ready
for prime time.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.391
"Removal of remains
for sale, purchase

28:17.434 --> 28:18.740
or punishment."

28:18.784 --> 28:20.220
Category D felony.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.352
This might give us cover.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.879
You know if we're wrong
about this guy,

28:26.922 --> 28:29.142
that's the ball game.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.231
You'll have to watch
David Hodges's trial

28:31.274 --> 28:32.928
from the cheap seats.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.582
Max, if you have
any hesitation

28:34.625 --> 28:36.497
about this, it shouldn't
be what happens to us.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.020
We're not the ones with
the long career ahead of us.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.456
There's other ways
to get a warrant.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.197
One that doesn't
put your job at risk.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.897
No. This is my job.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.508
If David Hodges goes down,

28:47.551 --> 28:50.772
then this lab's reputation
never recovers.

28:50.816 --> 28:54.689
I'll get you that warrant
to search Kline's house.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.264
Hey, little man.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.308
Hey.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.310
You know, I need to hang on

29:07.354 --> 29:09.573
to the snow globe your uncle
gave you a little longer.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.575
So until
I can give it back,

29:11.619 --> 29:14.013
I figured
you should have another one.

29:15.014 --> 29:18.017
He's nervous about CPS today.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.975
- Yeah.
- What do you say, Cole?

29:20.019 --> 29:22.325
- Thanks.
- Good job.

29:22.369 --> 29:24.545
I'm gonna get your stuff, buddy.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.199
Okay.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.462
Hey, sometimes in life,

29:28.505 --> 29:30.072
it feels like
we're caught in a storm.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.465
You can't see
what lies ahead.

29:31.508 --> 29:34.163
And then things settle.
You can see clearly.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.558
You know, when I was your age,

29:37.601 --> 29:39.081
I spent a little time
where you're going today.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.779
And you're gonna
be fine, all right?

29:43.259 --> 29:45.609
Hi Cole. I'm Theresa.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.307
And it's Laura, right?
You're the one who called?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.831
Yeah. He's, uh, all set to go.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.702
Joshua Folsom, Criminalistics.

29:51.746 --> 29:53.835
If Cole needs
anything, you call me.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.794
Okay. If we're all done

29:55.837 --> 29:57.578
with goodbyes,
just sign right here.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.115
Here you go.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.421
Thanks.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.118
Come on, Cole.
I got it.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.512
- Be good, Cole.
- Watch your step.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.864
What?

30:22.908 --> 30:25.214
Just wave to the boy.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.348
We're not doing this here.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.884
There's this riddle I know.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.582
How does someone get frostbite
in the desert?

30:45.626 --> 30:48.803
Well, it's kind of a cheat. See,

30:48.847 --> 30:50.457
they're not in the desert.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.981
They're over it.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.157
40,000 feet up,

30:55.201 --> 30:58.639
where it's minus 60 degrees.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.992
- Am I being accused of something?
Not yet.

31:04.036 --> 31:07.300
Maybe soon. You look a lot
like a killer we're after.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.779
Oh.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.260
I'm not a murderer.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.522
Don't get huffy,

31:12.566 --> 31:13.872
former Airman Kennerly.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.482
It's a matter of public record,

31:15.525 --> 31:17.571
you're an attempted murderer.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.616
Six years in an Air Force brig
for trying

31:19.660 --> 31:21.140
to kill your superior officer.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.882
Oh, seems lenient now.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.971
I made a mistake.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.974
I have paid for it.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.933
And I have
turned my life around.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.283
Whose idea was it
to steal those poker chips?

31:34.327 --> 31:36.068
- Yours or Truette's?
- Well, it must have

31:36.111 --> 31:38.418
been his because I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.246
Maybe he wanted

31:40.289 --> 31:43.989
to get down to Mexico,
ride jump seat.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.947
If there was no record
of him on that flight,

31:45.991 --> 31:48.297
then nobody would know
- what he did.
- The other possibility

31:48.341 --> 31:50.909
would be that his murderous
babysitter sold him on a plan.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.699
<i>He smuggles you on board.</i>

31:58.742 --> 32:00.048
<i>He distracts the pilot.</i>

32:00.092 --> 32:02.007
<i>You grab the chips.</i>

32:02.050 --> 32:04.009
<i>You get back in the bag.</i>

32:04.052 --> 32:08.709
<i>And the thing is, if you had
done that, you'd be rich.</i>

32:08.752 --> 32:12.104
But not <i>as</i> rich, right?

32:12.147 --> 32:14.280
One million bucks
wasn't enough for you.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.673
Ellis Truette was dying.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.241
He was stealing
to provide for his son.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.983
I can almost understand that,
but you...

32:22.027 --> 32:23.985
butchering three people?

32:24.029 --> 32:27.989
Making that sweet kid an orphan?

32:28.033 --> 32:30.296
Takes a special kind
of evil, Laura.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.516
You can't prove I was up there.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.865
If you're not
charging me

32:34.909 --> 32:36.128
with anything, I can go, right?

32:36.171 --> 32:37.216
The door is right there.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.869
But I'm not gonna kid you.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.393
We'll be watching.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.358
Ooh, she doesn't like you.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.013
She's really gonna hate me
when I put her on that plane.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.287
There you are.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.813
Feds tracked down
Gary's girlfriend.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.902
Jenny Romero had an alibi.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.643
Makes sense. She didn't do it.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.298
Mm. I was a bit surprised
to hear it was

33:16.342 --> 33:18.170
the babysitter
who swung the ax.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.910
Any luck here?

33:19.954 --> 33:21.303
A lot of prints on the packages
in the crate she opened,

33:21.347 --> 33:22.739
but none were hers.

33:22.783 --> 33:25.394
Nothing puts Laura
on this plane.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.483
I'm out of places to look.

33:27.527 --> 33:28.702
Well, this got released.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.921
Oh, thanks.

33:30.965 --> 33:34.055
I'd like to get that
back to Cole.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.014
Mm.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.841
Hmm.

33:49.897 --> 33:51.551
The blood on the ceiling.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.080
It was upside down.

34:10.439 --> 34:14.400

34:14.443 --> 34:15.923

34:50.740 --> 34:53.003
Got another riddle
for you, Laura.

34:53.047 --> 34:56.616
What's tiny, colorful
and worth the rest of your life?

34:57.791 --> 35:01.186
It's called an "AFID tag." See?

35:01.229 --> 35:03.013
This little gal
and a hundred just like her

35:03.057 --> 35:06.191
get blown out of a taser
every time one's fired.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.323
The little
serial numbers there?

35:08.367 --> 35:10.108
They're tied
to just one cartridge.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.198
Like the one you bought.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.503
- And used

35:14.547 --> 35:16.288
to kill three people.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.727
<i>But taking out the pilots
didn't go as planned, did it?</i>

35:20.770 --> 35:23.295
<i>'Cause they fought back.</i>

35:23.338 --> 35:26.733
<i>So you grabbed the
closest weapon you could--</i>

35:26.776 --> 35:30.171
<i>the crash ax-- and that's when
things got very, very bloody,</i>

35:30.215 --> 35:32.652
<i>even before
the plane started to roll.</i>

35:44.011 --> 35:46.448
And by the time
the plane stabilized,

35:46.492 --> 35:48.233
I'm sure you thought
they were all dead.

35:53.499 --> 35:57.938
<i>But one other person</i>

35:57.981 --> 36:01.159
<i>your partner, Ellis Truette.</i>

36:02.986 --> 36:06.076
He had just enough fight
left in him to shut

36:06.120 --> 36:08.427
the door and activate
the auto-land system.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.256
Is that right?
Wow. What a hero.

36:11.299 --> 36:14.259
- Maybe not, but Ellis
Truette's final act

36:14.302 --> 36:16.870
was saving thousands
of lives on the ground.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.959
And he wasn't a killer.

36:23.877 --> 36:26.314
What do I get
if I give it back?

36:26.358 --> 36:27.402
Oh, you will.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.882
But first...

36:31.537 --> 36:33.452
You know how those fit, right?

36:38.457 --> 36:40.372
Sorry about your timing,

36:40.415 --> 36:42.417
Dr. Grissom, but you might be
a little too late

36:42.461 --> 36:43.853
with that warrant.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.333
Not much left to search here.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.205
The call came in an hour ago.

36:47.248 --> 36:48.771
That's when
the neighbors heard it.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.425
Do you know
if they saw anything?

36:50.469 --> 36:52.645
No witnesses is what I heard.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.345
Cops are outside.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.826
I don't even think
they've got an ID yet.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.743
- Honestly, good
luck with that one.

37:09.444 --> 37:13.622
His name was Martin Kline.

37:13.666 --> 37:17.800
Hopefully,
DNA will give us an ID,

37:17.844 --> 37:20.890
seeing as how his teeth blew up
with his head.

37:20.934 --> 37:23.371
It's Kline's watch, his shoes.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.895
Yeah, probably not
his grenade, though.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.593
Yeah.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.552
I guess the new question now is,

37:30.596 --> 37:32.075
who'd want Kline dead?

37:32.119 --> 37:33.990
I mean, the timing of this...

37:34.034 --> 37:36.819
Yeah, right before
we show up to search.

37:36.863 --> 37:40.258
Any proof that Kline was
connected to Hodges's case...

37:41.302 --> 37:43.261
Whoever did this,
pretty determined

37:43.304 --> 37:46.873
to keep their secrets a secret.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.706
- Uncle Gary.
- Oh!

37:53.749 --> 37:56.230
- Ah!
- Look who it is, huh?

37:57.710 --> 37:59.668
- What are you doing here, man?
- So...

37:59.712 --> 38:02.062
Huh? I didn't know
I was gonna see you today.

38:02.105 --> 38:05.195
Um, s-sorry.
M-Mr. Folsom

38:05.239 --> 38:06.893
was showing me
how they do fingerprints.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.329
Oh, man,
don't worry about it.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.983
You look so cool.
You got stuff on your face.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.072
Hey, Cole.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.204
You know, you can
see Bridge Mountain

38:14.248 --> 38:16.337
if you squint from over there.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.513
- Really?
- Yeah. I want to talk to
your uncle for a sec, okay?

38:18.557 --> 38:21.299
Go check it out, bud.

38:21.342 --> 38:22.952
Thought I was
coming in here to, uh,

38:22.996 --> 38:24.998
thank you for what
you did for Ellis.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.348
But I mean, I... what...?

38:27.392 --> 38:29.045
What is he doing here?

38:29.089 --> 38:31.047
Cole hasn't been
placed in a home yet.

38:31.091 --> 38:33.180
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

38:34.137 --> 38:37.227
That's what your cousin wanted
when the cancer got him, right?

38:39.404 --> 38:41.710
He tell you he was
gonna set you two up?

38:41.754 --> 38:45.584
Hey, man, I'm not here
to bust you, all right?

38:45.627 --> 38:48.369
I'm here about what's left
of your family.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.371
What's best for him.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.331
I mean, you know, I mean,
I lo... I love that kid.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.637
And he deserved...

38:56.638 --> 38:59.380
I'm just not sure
I'd make a great dad.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.382
Having a not-great dad
who loves him is

39:01.426 --> 39:03.384
a hell of a lot better
than no dad at all.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.821
Believe me. I know.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.437
You really think
I could do it?

39:12.480 --> 39:14.787
Cole!
Come here, bud.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.832
Yeah, come over
here, buddy.

39:18.312 --> 39:22.708
Hey, I'm gonna leave you
with your Uncle, all right?

39:25.319 --> 39:27.321
You remember what I told you?

39:27.365 --> 39:30.368
My dad was a hero.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.199
Yo!

39:37.244 --> 39:39.289
- Aah! Aah!
- He's strong, man.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.291
It's the strong friendship,
you know?

39:41.335 --> 39:43.946
Come on, buddy.
Let's get out of here.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.310
Hey, Sara?

40:48.837 --> 40:52.841
The fire in here didn't
come from the blast.

40:53.842 --> 40:58.368
- Someone didn't want us to
play with Dr. Kline's toys.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.067
This just looks
like a giant mess.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.678
It was actually
someone cleaning up.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.509
- What's that?
- Duct tape.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.772
It was stuck to what
was left of his neck.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.905
The grenade was
taped to him.

41:12.948 --> 41:15.255
Kline was working for someone
else when he framed Hodges.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.083
He had to be.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.436
Well, we didn't pack for a fire.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.004
Max is sending a team. We don't
have to do all this ourselves.

41:25.047 --> 41:27.963
Mm. I'll see
if the fire guys got

41:28.007 --> 41:30.096
some shovels
we can use.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.033
Hey, Sara?

41:54.076 --> 41:56.992
You didn't process
this hallway, did you?

41:58.603 --> 42:00.561
Not yet, no.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.737
- Could you close the door?
- Uh-huh.

42:11.441 --> 42:15.228
I think
they finally made a mistake.
