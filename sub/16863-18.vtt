WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.085
Previously on "rescue me"...

00:02.127 --> 00:05.422
Hoist your glasses,boy. Your
friend lou is getting hitched.

00:05.464 --> 00:06.506
Get the hell out.

00:06.541 --> 00:07.549
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.469
You're marrying your
ex-hooker,ex-thief girlfriend,

00:10.511 --> 00:13.805
you don't tell your
supposedly,uh,best buddy in the world?

00:13.840 --> 00:17.100
Gee,you know what?
And i wonder why I wouldn't do that.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.977
Yo,bust his hole,franco!

00:23.190 --> 00:26.485
As far as I'm concerned,it
is either her or me.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.279
Are you trying to say that me
and tommy are some sort of a game?

00:29.321 --> 00:31.281
Yes,yes,it is a goddamn game.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.909
You,me,him,us-this whole goddamn thing,

00:33.944 --> 00:36.286
- and now,the jig is up.
- Ok.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.414
We got some very smoking ladies here,

00:39.456 --> 00:42.084
and I'd say 70% of them
are friends of carla'S.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.259
We got bull dykes.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.261
Jesus christ,I'm banging a gay chick.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.800
We got to get the blonde broad away from
that one dyke over there in the corner.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.552
Mind if I cut in?

00:52.511 --> 00:53.595
Come on.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.640
I need to get in there.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.771
Get her out of there!

01:04.857 --> 01:07.192
Thanks,fellas.
I'm all set.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.653
That was awesome.

Jimmy.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.222
Bad dream?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.308
Yeah.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.771
Were,uh,sheila and janet
and that new chick in it?

05:55.606 --> 05:57.774
You were talking.

05:57.809 --> 05:59.783
Yeah.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.862
Were you banging all 3 of them,or were you-

06:01.904 --> 06:04.121
No.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.617
You got a problem,my friend...

06:06.658 --> 06:08.994
a serious problem.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.956
- What's in the box?
- Nothing.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.585
Is it cupcakes?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.255
Maybe.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.842
How many?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.929
18.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.474
18 cupcakes?

06:30.516 --> 06:33.060
And I have a problem?

07:25.863 --> 07:27.079
Hey.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.199
Jennifer aniston's ass.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.243
Ok.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.328
I'm looking at her picture here. Opinion?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.164
- On a scale of 1 to 10?
- Yeah.

07:35.199 --> 07:36.498
Going,uh,13.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.917
- Oh,really?
- Yeah. I got a thing.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.210
For her ass?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.546
Her ass,her elbows,her knees. Look.

07:42.581 --> 07:43.964
Yeah,I definitely got a thing.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.301
- Feet?
- Feet,I'm going... 21.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.512
- lips?
- Lips...

07:50.554 --> 07:54.975
upper lip,42; lower lip,47-48.48.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.151
Interesting.
Ears?

07:57.186 --> 07:59.479
You never really get to see the ears,do you?

07:59.514 --> 08:01.315
I think it's because of the haircut.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.447
I love the haircut.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.194
It's like-it's like dream hair.
It's like angel hair.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.654
It's like angel hair pasta.
I want to eat it.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.615
You're a deeply disturbed man,tommy gavin.

08:09.656 --> 08:14.620
Yeah,well,it's-you know,it's-I think
it's part of her mysterious side,

08:14.655 --> 08:15.460
you know what i mean?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.623
It's like,you never get to see-

08:17.664 --> 08:21.126
what if she's got ears that are shaped
like vaginas?Wouldn't that be cool?

08:21.919 --> 08:25.214
Because she's not like these other
chick actresses where they're just,like,

08:25.255 --> 08:26.555
you see everything and it's all hanging out.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.509
Like,even when she's naked,she's
not really just naked.

08:28.544 --> 08:29.718
Like,she was on the cover of "rolling stone"

08:29.760 --> 08:31.553
when she was still on
"friends" 10 years ago,

08:31.588 --> 08:32.644
and she was laying on her stomach,

08:32.679 --> 08:34.806
and she was naked right on the cover,but

08:34.847 --> 08:36.225
you could see her ass,but
you couldn't see her ass

08:36.265 --> 08:38.477
because it was kind of out of
focus. I like that,you know?

08:38.519 --> 08:39.985
It's mysterious,you know?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.653
It's like when she was
on the cover of "gq. "

08:41.688 --> 08:43.822
She was naked,but she had her
nipples covered with her hands

08:43.857 --> 08:47.402
- and she had a long tie that hung down-
- That picture was photoshopped.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.865
What do you mean,she
wasn't really wearing a tie?

08:51.907 --> 08:55.827
No,I mean all the normal nooks
and crannies of a real chick-

08:55.869 --> 09:00.499
you know,stretch marks,little hairy
moles,thigh dimples-all erased.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.960
Thigh dimples?
Cellulite.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.254
Oh. I like thigh dimples better.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
That's probably because
you have a couple,don't you?

09:07.422 --> 09:09.883
Hey,where's pillow lips?

09:09.918 --> 09:12.309
- Pillow...
- Pillow lips.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.637
Can you help us out
there a little bit,honey?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.889
The puerto rican hunk that had me
in a bear hug the night of the fire.

09:15.924 --> 09:17.933
- I want to thank him.
- Really?Why don't you thank me,

09:17.975 --> 09:20.435
because I'm the one that you kicked
in the balls,which kind of hurt.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.564
Sorry,but that's not really
helping me find pillow lips,is it?

09:23.605 --> 09:27.192
So could you please maybe just run along
and try to track him down for me,ron?

09:27.227 --> 09:28.527
My name's tommy.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.487
Yeah,but you got kind of a
ron howard thing going on.

09:30.522 --> 09:31.488
Ron howard?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.574
Ron howard with-with hair?

09:33.615 --> 09:35.909
- Yeah,I see it.
- See?You go,girl.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.412
Look. I'll leave my number.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.123
Tell puerto rican brad pitt I
want to meet him for a drink.

09:41.165 --> 09:44.126
Yeah,look. Uh,brown brad is,uh-

09:44.161 --> 09:45.425
is pretty well spoken for.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.920
What the hell was in
that box the other night?

09:46.962 --> 09:48.463
Yeah,yeah,what was in
that box the other night?

09:48.498 --> 09:49.965
- None of your business.
- Oh,ok. Well.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.572
It is our business. We're fire
guys,and,you know,you were-

09:52.607 --> 09:55.137
- you're running into a fire-
- Nobody's talking to you,opie.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.062
What about the other cute guy?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.807
- The black one?
- Yeah,he's taken,too.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.726
Yeah,he's dating my daughter.

10:00.761 --> 10:02.985
So you're married?

10:03.020 --> 10:05.397
- Sort of.
- Already way more than i wanted to know.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.115
What about the dumb guy?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.422
Mike?You talked to mike the other night?

10:09.457 --> 10:10.694
We locked eyes for a couple seconds.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.155
And from that,you knew he was dumb?

10:13.190 --> 10:15.574
God,yes. That boy is completely empty.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.534
Nothing going on up here,which is good

10:17.576 --> 10:19.912
because it cuts down on
the witty repartee bullshit.

10:19.947 --> 10:21.705
How are his abs?

10:21.747 --> 10:25.501
You know,I-I just want to say that what you
did the other night was extremely dangerous.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.376
- No shit.
- Yeah.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.759
Yeah.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.379
But it was awesome.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.758
I mean,my heart was beating,like,

10:32.799 --> 10:33.891
a million miles a minute.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.220
You guys must have a
blast doing what you do.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.848
You know,I always knew that
you were-you were,you know,

10:39.890 --> 10:41.690
special and brave and all that bullshit,

10:41.725 --> 10:45.896
but I didn't really get
it until I did it myself.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.280
What about the vampire?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.193
- What vampire?
- The pasty,skinny kid.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.322
He looks like one of
those "twilight" assholes.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.164
- Damian.
- Damian?

10:57.199 --> 10:58.992
That's perfect.
He even has a vampire name.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.744
Yeah,ok.
He's 21 years old.

11:00.786 --> 11:01.745
I love it.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.790
I'll be a bloodsucked mrs. Robinson.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.210
Hey,did you guys use my body wash?

11:08.245 --> 11:09.551
Hi.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.922
- Oh,you're the,uh-
- I'm the,um...

11:11.964 --> 11:16.468
hot older chick who saved her own ass
in the brownstone fire the other night.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.263
Hey,listen. Um...

11:21.098 --> 11:23.308
are you free tomorrow night?

11:23.343 --> 11:24.852
Um,for?

11:24.893 --> 11:28.355
Drinks,dinner...

11:30.774 --> 11:33.277
- is that vanilla?
- Uh,yeah.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.238
- I'm trying out this new cologne.
- You should wear it tomorrow.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.323
Call me for the time and place.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.209
See you.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.413
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.334
Wow.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.003
No shit,wow.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.261
Hey.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.174
Is this that,uh,kim kardashian?

11:55.209 --> 11:57.176
- Yep.
- Classic.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.969
So that's reggie bush?

11:59.011 --> 12:00.721
No,no,no,the dude is,uh,ray J.

12:00.756 --> 12:02.396
Ray J.Who the hell's ray j?

12:02.431 --> 12:04.141
- He's a rapper.
- No,he's not.

12:04.176 --> 12:05.893
He's like a discount usher.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.229
Usher like what?
Like works in a ballpark?

12:09.271 --> 12:11.085
Lou's a little behind the times.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.900
He thinks 50 cent is half a dollar.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.527
Hey,in today's economy,50
cents is worth half a quarter.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.238
All right.
So let me get this straight.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.115
So world-renowned running back

12:20.157 --> 12:25.245
reggie bush is dating a
girl who has a sex tape out

12:25.287 --> 12:30.709
featuring her having sex in almost...

12:30.744 --> 12:36.298
every possible position...

12:36.333 --> 12:41.720
with another guy?

12:41.762 --> 12:42.513
Shit.

12:42.554 --> 12:46.892
This videotape is probably the reason
why he called her up in the first place.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.695
I mean,I got to tell you,it
beats the hell out of eharmony.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.199
Hey,look at that booty.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.700
Big as a house.

13:03.742 --> 13:08.080
Yeah,it's gonna be as big as a
shopping mall by the time she's 35.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.874
Oh,make that 32.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.418
Yeah,everybody out.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.672
- Out.
- All right. Let's go.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.590
See you.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.137
So is there anything you want
to say before I lay this out?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.894
You think I look like ron howard?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.940
Ron howard?
What,you mean opie?

13:36.108 --> 13:38.735
Crazy,right?
These guys...

13:38.777 --> 13:40.654
Well,you know,I don't know.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.699
I mean,you may be a little,like,opie-esque-

13:43.734 --> 13:45.325
you know,if opie grew up in red hook

13:45.367 --> 13:47.452
and his mom had sex with satan.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.840
All right,here's the deal,op.

13:52.875 --> 13:57.212
I am not here to dig up the dead or
unravel the messy mistakes we've made,

13:57.254 --> 14:00.883
ok?I just want what is best for the kids.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.178
So katy is gonna leave the
house permanently in 5 years.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.181
So 5 years is what I'm asking for,ok?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.995
We stick it out together
that long as mom and dad.

14:10.030 --> 14:12.769
You stay in your own
place,but when she's around,

14:12.811 --> 14:14.938
we act like we've been acting.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.609
Ok?Because I want her to have a sense
of security for at least that long.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.152
So what do you think?

14:20.187 --> 14:22.279
5 years?

14:22.863 --> 14:24.323
Ok,sexwise,

14:24.364 --> 14:29.369
I mean,we still have this animal
attraction for each other,ok?

14:29.404 --> 14:31.455
So we can just keep that going

14:31.497 --> 14:33.957
and satisfy each other's physical needs.

14:33.992 --> 14:36.168
But here is the dealbreaker.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.297
We don't sleep with anyone else.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.509
For 5 years?

14:45.260 --> 14:47.012
Ok?Well,we both get sex.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.723
Katy gets security.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.520
Uh,let me put this in terms
that you can understand.

14:54.555 --> 14:55.896
You're a free agent.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.857
Ok?I am offering you an incredible deal.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.485
Sheila's the red sox,I'm the yankees.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.904
I have a hell of a lot more to offer.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.621
And how do you figure that?

15:05.656 --> 15:08.137
Because I come with your children,

15:08.172 --> 15:10.619
and if you take me up on my offer,

15:10.661 --> 15:13.664
your daughter won't end up hating you.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.959
And who says she's gonna hate me?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.135
Well,I could personally guarantee it.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.679
I mean,between what I whisper
in her sweet,little ears

15:22.714 --> 15:26.802
and the divorce court's overwhelming
tendency to put the kids with their mother,

15:26.837 --> 15:28.887
you'd be lucky if you saw her one weekend a month.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.722
And you add a mistress to this scenario,

15:30.764 --> 15:32.891
you may never lay eyes on katy again.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.185
Now,i know,I know,it's a little mean,

15:35.220 --> 15:38.063
and it is not very romantic.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.116
But we both took the vows...

15:43.151 --> 15:48.156
for better or worse,in
good times and in bad,

15:48.740 --> 15:53.453
and I am just trying to make
the best of a shitty situation.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.083
Think it over.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.091
You know,and if you need
to talk to someone about it,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.302
you might try talking to pa

16:08.343 --> 16:11.763
the next time you go
down to the fishing hole.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.185
Oh,that's so funny.
Ha!

16:25.027 --> 16:26.570
Assholes!

16:32.409 --> 16:34.036
Come on,frankie,move!

16:34.077 --> 16:36.788
Get the lead out of your ass!

16:37.664 --> 16:40.459
Sorry,chief. I think I'm just still hurting
from that party the other night,you know?

16:40.501 --> 16:41.585
Come on,frankie,get out of there.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.128
You're stinking up the joint.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.839
Shit.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.716
Let's focus,ok?

16:47.758 --> 16:49.676
You think you're ready for your
fight against wilson next week,

16:49.718 --> 16:51.011
you're out of your puerto rican mind!

16:51.053 --> 16:52.644
Hey,go easy on him,will you?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
Don't go easy. That's the goose
that laid the golden egg,lou,

16:54.716 --> 16:56.183
and you're supposed to
be his goddamn trainer.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.316
So we overdid it a little bit.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.269
He needed to blow off some steam.
We all did.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.480
Yeah. Well,my idea of blowing
off steam isn't a bar brawl

17:01.515 --> 17:03.565
with a bunch of drunken dykes.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.526
Though it does sound pretty hot.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.779
Wow!That must have been great,

17:08.819 --> 17:11.573
seeing teddy go mano a lesbo
with one of those broads.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.159
Yeah,well,she broke his nose
and cracked 3 of his ribs.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.036
And I missed it.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.498
Wait a minute.
I just had a moment of genius.

17:19.532 --> 17:21.089
It'll pass.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.294
What if we put franco in the
ring with one of those dykes?

17:24.336 --> 17:25.546
- What?
- Yeah.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.673
Listen. He's beating the shit
out of all his male opponents.

17:27.708 --> 17:28.806
Nobody wants to fight him.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.968
More importantly,nobody
wants to bet against him.

17:31.003 --> 17:32.886
Our side action is going in the toilet.

17:32.921 --> 17:37.022
But we build a franco-lesbo brawl,

17:37.057 --> 17:38.684
who's not gonna want to
put money down on that?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.936
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

17:40.978 --> 17:45.941
A member of the fdny climbing into a ring
and punching a lesbian person repeatedly

17:45.983 --> 17:48.193
about the face and body for the sole purpose

17:48.235 --> 17:51.613
of entertaining a bloodthirsty
crowd of drunken bettors,

17:51.648 --> 17:53.949
their fists full of cash,screaming for-

17:53.991 --> 17:55.749
- I got an angle on this.
- Ok,go.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.912
We bill it as like a bobby
riggs-billie jean kind of thing,

17:58.954 --> 18:01.039
a battle of the sexes for the modern world,

18:01.081 --> 18:03.959
only instead of swatting around
a faggy little yellow ball,

18:03.994 --> 18:06.044
these two are beating the
piss out of each other.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.964
I love this!I'm getting
goosebumps. Look at my arm.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.757
- Aw,shit.
- What is it,a thing?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.266
No.
No,no,reality check.

18:12.301 --> 18:15.095
What about if she-she whips
his ass or he whips her ass?

18:15.130 --> 18:17.657
I mean,bad from a public
relations standpoint either way.

18:17.692 --> 18:20.184
Lou,we're not gonna put him in
the ring with keira knightley.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.770
We are gonna find the biggest,ugliest,meanest
lesbian on this planet.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.355
Hillary clinton would never do this.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.316
She's not a lesbian.
Yeah,I know,but would you fight her?

18:27.357 --> 18:29.484
Not without weapons.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.486
Oh,my god. All right,all right.
Save that thought.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.280
Ok,look.
We got a genius idea.

18:33.322 --> 18:34.788
Getting an opponent is not a problem.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.450
The problem may be getting franco on board.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.286
I mean,tough chick or not,he might
have a moral dilemma with this.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.996
You mean the same moral dilemma you had

18:41.031 --> 18:42.414
until you thought about the money?

18:42.456 --> 18:43.749
- We're gonna be rich.
- I know.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.791
We're gonna be rich.

18:48.170 --> 18:52.758
You know,you said a couple few things,ok?

18:52.799 --> 18:53.425
See,look what I have.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.260
I have a tv,and I have
a couch,and I have a bed.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.387
That's 3 things. That's a few,ok?

18:57.429 --> 18:58.937
This is a shitload.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.814
I am a girl. I have needs-

19:00.849 --> 19:05.611
you know,jeans,shoes,boots,sandals,my
platforms.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.524
You're gonna need,like,a whole
separate room just for the shoes

19:08.565 --> 19:10.234
the way we're going.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.069
I can have that?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.570
Oh,my god,thanks,daddy!

19:13.612 --> 19:15.489
You're welcome,honey. Nice.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.449
Shawn,can you put the other
shoe trunk in that room?

19:17.491 --> 19:19.117
Yeah. Come on,give me a
hand with the trunk,man.

19:19.152 --> 19:20.744
No,I mean,I need to talk to her.

19:20.786 --> 19:21.954
Why?
That shit is heavy!

19:21.995 --> 19:24.331
Listen. I just lost a
whole room to goddamn shoes.

19:24.373 --> 19:27.751
Now,you go-you want to have sex
with my daughter at my place?

19:27.786 --> 19:30.379
Tell your story walking,pal.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.050
Listen.
We got to talk about him,ok?

19:35.092 --> 19:37.928
I want to just be clear
about a couple things.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.430
Ok?He gets to come over,like
you said,a couple times a week,

19:40.472 --> 19:42.182
but let's make sure we
know what a couple is.

19:42.217 --> 19:44.014
Two. Dos.
That's a couple,ok.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.811
All right.
We talked about this.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.312
- Ok.
- Ok.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.365
There's a lot of rules I want to lay down.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.778
I want to just cover a couple
of big ones right now,ok?

19:54.813 --> 19:58.282
When it comes to you two doing...

19:58.323 --> 20:00.701
stuff,ok?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.953
Do you know what I'm talking about?

20:02.988 --> 20:04.955
- Yes.
- Ok.

20:04.997 --> 20:05.587
Don't have to say it.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.332
You've done what you have in,

20:07.374 --> 20:11.628
you know,sexual relations
when-obviously,not when I'm here.

20:11.663 --> 20:12.754
- Obviously!
- Ok.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.715
But also,like,when
I'm-according to my schedule,

20:14.756 --> 20:17.112
when I should be coming home
or I'm about to come home,

20:17.147 --> 20:19.469
I don't want to-I don't want
to hear anything,and I don't,

20:19.504 --> 20:22.014
you know,want to smell anything.
I'm just saying.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.036
- Ok!
- And I don't want

20:24.071 --> 20:26.018
to feel any sex... vibes.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.235
What's a sex vibe?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.731
- What's this thing with the sex vibe?
- Make sure he's clear on that,ok?

20:30.766 --> 20:32.489
Ok!
I got it.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.693
And the other thing is,you-

20:34.735 --> 20:36.994
we should work out a laundry schedule

20:37.029 --> 20:43.076
because i don't-I don't want
to have to deal with the...

20:44.328 --> 20:46.663
funderwear.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.249
Funderwear?

20:50.584 --> 20:51.627
You know what I'm talking about,

20:51.668 --> 20:53.385
the sexy,lacy

20:53.420 --> 20:54.984
- whatever that stuff is.
- Oh,my gosh. Dad!

20:55.019 --> 20:56.548
I don't have a problem
with regular underwear.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.800
It's just the other stuff.
So you'll have to wash that stuff in-

20:58.842 --> 21:00.302
Ok. Well,then don't look in my stuff.

21:00.337 --> 21:01.310
All right.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.555
Do you want me to help you unpack this?

21:03.597 --> 21:05.140
Sure.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.726
So...

21:07.768 --> 21:10.604
have you talked to katy and
talked to her on a regular basis?

21:10.646 --> 21:13.106
Yeah.
I mean,we text all the time.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.524
- And she's ok?
- Yeah.

21:14.559 --> 21:15.866
- Ok.
- I mean,I think so.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.237
She's totally into the whole,you
know,family thing right now.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.280
So she's,uh...

21:21.073 --> 21:23.909
honey,all right.
You know what?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.579
Take your hands off of my stuff.
You should have-

21:27.614 --> 21:29.498
Ok. It should be labeled "funderwear," ok?

21:29.533 --> 21:32.376
What-what-who is this...
whatever.

21:35.963 --> 21:36.922
So she's fine?

21:36.964 --> 21:38.222
- Yes.
- Good.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.467
And she's actually
really,really happy right now.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.052
- That's great.
- Yeah.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.887
I mean,I think she's,

21:43.929 --> 21:47.724
you know,almost on the verge of
forgiving mom for the whole,uh,

21:47.759 --> 21:49.399
breakup thing.

21:49.434 --> 21:52.020
I mean,I don't think she's
quite as mad at her anymore...

21:52.055 --> 21:54.064
which is really good.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.405
Yeah.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.361
I mean,you know,she hates living
at home with mom and the baby.

21:59.403 --> 22:00.445
She couldn't stand it.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.948
I mean,she was so freaked out about

22:02.983 --> 22:05.409
the whole uncle johnny affair thing.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.411
She wanted to move in with you,

22:07.452 --> 22:10.003
but mom said that would only
happen over her dead body,

22:10.038 --> 22:12.332
so that's when she came up with
the whole private school thing,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.251
- which she loves,by the way.
- Right.

22:14.293 --> 22:17.754
But that whole,um,mummy/mom thing-

22:17.796 --> 22:20.507
I mean,that's just because
she hated mom so much for

22:20.549 --> 22:23.510
breaking up the family and for you leaving.

22:23.552 --> 22:26.889
You know,if she had it her way,she
would be moving in with us right now.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.559
That's funny. Your
mother never mentioned the

22:30.594 --> 22:32.352
katy wanting to live...

22:32.394 --> 22:34.771
Of course.
It's mom.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.940
I know.
Listen.

22:37.649 --> 22:41.945
This whole divorce,whatever
it is,it's-you know,it'S...

22:41.987 --> 22:43.537
it's a two-way street,you know?

22:43.572 --> 22:47.159
Your mother's not
completely to blame,you know?

22:47.201 --> 22:50.162
I mean,i certainly did my share of-

22:50.204 --> 22:52.414
she did some crazy stuff,but,you know.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.500
Dad,I hate her,too.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.417
Ok.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.295
You know,I mean,not as
much as I used to,but...

22:58.337 --> 23:02.132
I'm gonna be so happy here
no matter what happens because

23:02.174 --> 23:03.675
secretly,deep down,

23:03.717 --> 23:05.886
I know it's really gonna drive her crazy.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.645
Oh!
Lordy,jesus!

23:08.680 --> 23:10.807
All right.
Calm down.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.101
Jesus,mary,and joseph.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.651
Oh,come on.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.959
This-this is what you need help with?

23:16.994 --> 23:19.233
It fell out of my hands,all right?

23:22.778 --> 23:25.531
Listen to me.
Listen.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.533
- Let me explain something to you.
- What?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.743
No sex with my daughter in
my house,and don't-ah-ah.

23:29.778 --> 23:31.912
- It's my house,my rules.
- What are you talking about?

23:31.954 --> 23:33.962
You are not having sex with my daughter-

23:33.997 --> 23:35.255
- look in my eyes.
- I can't make any promises.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.960
There's no promises to be made.
I am telling you,it's the law.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.384
Hey,when she wants it,she wants it.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.879
- She's a gavin,ok?
- Then you know what you do?

23:40.921 --> 23:44.341
You get a hotel room or you take her
back to your place,because you are not-

23:44.376 --> 23:47.970
you will not lay a finger
on my daughter in...

23:49.596 --> 23:50.806
forget I said that word.

23:50.848 --> 23:55.310
No fingering,no fondling,none
of the "f" words in my house.

23:56.103 --> 23:56.777
Ok.
That's it.

23:56.812 --> 23:59.398
Just help me with it.
Goddamn it.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.953
- Hey.
- Yo,what's up,dude?

24:05.988 --> 24:07.948
- Hi.
- How'd the date go last night?

24:08.991 --> 24:10.534
get over here,will you?

24:10.576 --> 24:13.036
- You ok?
- No,I'm definitely not ok.

24:13.071 --> 24:15.497
- What's wrong?
- I got serious problems.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.021
You didn't kill her,did you?

24:19.056 --> 24:20.919
- What?Kill who?
- Your date.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.880
No!Of course not.
What's the matter with you?Jesus.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.006
All right.
You were just making me nervous.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.632
I mean,what-what's the problem?

24:28.594 --> 24:29.935
It's my dick.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.680
Again,dude?
You should just get that thing removed.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.807
I know. I'm thinking about
it,actually,at this point.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.100
- Wh-what is it?
- I don't know,man.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.977
It's like the craziest shit ever.
I don't even know how to describe it.

24:37.012 --> 24:39.897
It's freaking me out completely and totally.
I don't even know-I-

24:39.932 --> 24:41.874
- Relax. Breathe.
- Ok.

24:41.909 --> 24:43.817
Ok?Come and sit down,and-and

24:43.859 --> 24:45.736
start from the beginning.
All right?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.157
I'm at the restaurant with the chick,right?

24:50.199 --> 24:51.742
And we're just sitting
there,and she's,like,crazy hot.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.702
And we're drinking,and
we're making eye contact,

24:53.744 --> 24:56.914
and the drinks are flowing,and the
conversation is good,and it's fantastic,right?

24:56.949 --> 24:59.166
I even took a shit at the restaurant
to get that out of the way,right?

24:59.201 --> 25:00.132
- Sweet,dude.
- All right.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.211
So we go back to the bar,we
have a few more drinks.

25:02.246 --> 25:03.962
Then we end up back at her place.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.422
Nice.
So that sounds like a good start.

25:05.464 --> 25:08.425
Well,yeah. I mean,it's humming along
fine until we end up in the bedroom.

25:08.467 --> 25:10.135
Ah,opening-day jitters,huh?

25:10.177 --> 25:13.555
No,bro. I mean,my shit was
solid as,like,a sherman tank,ok?

25:13.590 --> 25:16.683
She goes to unveil the dick,

25:16.725 --> 25:18.852
and she completely bugs out,bro.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.292
Because it's so small?

25:21.327 --> 25:23.690
- What?
- Nothing.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.108
My dick's not small.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.742
It-it's a little small.

25:26.777 --> 25:28.654
Dude,she didn't bug out
because I have a small dick,ok?

25:28.695 --> 25:30.197
You know why,mike?
Because I don't have a small dick.

25:30.232 --> 25:31.448
Everybody knows you have a small dick,dude.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.325
Bullshit,everybody knows.
What are you talking about?

25:33.360 --> 25:34.660
- Yeah,uh,ok,bro.
- You know what?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.453
She didn't bug out because I
have a small dick,all right?

25:36.495 --> 25:40.040
- Will you let me finish the story?
- Ok. But it's small.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.962
She says...

25:45.003 --> 25:47.381
it's discolored.

25:48.966 --> 25:51.051
That's not funny,jerkoff.

25:51.426 --> 25:52.476
Ah,yeah,it is,dude.

25:52.511 --> 25:53.846
No,it's not funny,dude.
I'm freaking out here.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.931
I'm thinking I may have some kind
of cancer of the dick going on.

25:55.973 --> 25:57.850
Dude,why would you have
cancer of the dick,dude?

25:57.885 --> 25:59.226
I don't know,revenge,maybe,

25:59.268 --> 26:02.729
for all the drunk-ass ugly chicks
I've banged in my life?I don't know.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.356
Look.
I...

26:05.566 --> 26:07.442
I need you to do me a favor.

26:07.484 --> 26:08.909
I need you to take a look.

26:08.944 --> 26:10.529
No way,dude,I'm not checking out your junk.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.198
Oh,really? That's funny because when you
thought you had a little lump in your testicle,

26:13.233 --> 26:14.408
who was the really nice
guy that reached in there

26:14.449 --> 26:16.952
and cupped your funbag to
check it out? That was me,pal!

26:16.987 --> 26:18.162
- You volunteered.
- Yeah,well,whatever.

26:18.197 --> 26:19.169
That's a technicality,all right?

26:19.204 --> 26:22.457
All the shit I've done for you over
the last few years,you owe me. Come on.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.295
All right.
Tweeze it out,dude.

26:28.338 --> 26:29.805
Ew,what are you doing?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.390
- I'm dropping trou,bro.
- No,you don't need to drop trou.

26:31.425 --> 26:34.261
Just use the "unzip the fly,reach in,and
pull it out" method like you're,uh,

26:34.303 --> 26:36.597
taking a piss at the parking
lot of a yankee game. Go.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.605
Ok.
All right.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.018
Um,hi. How are you?
My dick is over here.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.769
Yeah,dude. I don't want to
watch you pull it out,you know.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.195
- That's too gay.
- Is it really?It's too gay?

26:45.230 --> 26:47.191
You might have a relapse or something
and want to start playing with it?

26:47.232 --> 26:49.109
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it. Mike,

26:49.151 --> 26:50.868
I'm sorry.
Please. Come back.

26:50.903 --> 26:52.446
All right?
Just take a look,will you?All right.

26:52.487 --> 26:55.324
Just let me know when it's
out,and then I'll turn around.

26:55.365 --> 26:56.575
Ok.

26:58.869 --> 27:00.621
Ok,I'm ready.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.249
- Holy shit,dude!
- What?What?

27:04.291 --> 27:06.126
- Jesus christ!
- Why,what do you see?What is it?

27:06.168 --> 27:08.504
Well,the-I mean,there wasn't much
to see,but from what I saw,dude,

27:08.539 --> 27:11.048
it looked like a-like a-like
a baby-a baby carrot,dude.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.258
- You got to see a doctor.
- No!I'm not going to the doctor'S.

27:13.293 --> 27:14.927
Every time I go to the
doctor's,it's bad news,ok?

27:14.962 --> 27:16.929
I'm not doing that.
A baby carrot?Come on!

27:16.970 --> 27:18.805
- What's up,guys?
- Oh,hey,frank.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.225
Frank,he's got problems with his cock,dude.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.518
Again with the dick problems?

27:22.559 --> 27:24.248
Dude,I swear to god,you'd
be a goddamn millionaire

27:24.283 --> 27:25.938
if you just cut that thing
off and sold it to science.

27:25.979 --> 27:26.361
Yeah.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.732
So what's the problem this
time,pee wee,other than the size?

27:29.566 --> 27:31.527
It looks like a hairy cheese doodle.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.160
- What?
- Yeah. It's orange.

27:33.195 --> 27:36.990
It's not orange,ok?And it's
not small,for your information.

27:37.025 --> 27:38.700
Oh,yeah,it is.
Let's have a look.

27:38.735 --> 27:39.875
No. No.
Hell,no.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.245
I'm not showing you if
you're gonna make fun of it.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.579
Well,can't promise you that.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.046
Well,then,fine.
I'm not gonna show you.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.291
Fine. You want to go with dr.
Doolittle's diagnosis,more power to you.

27:46.326 --> 27:47.299
All right,all right,I'll
show it to you. All right.

27:47.334 --> 27:50.629
Come on,seriously. I just-I need
your advice,bro,seriously. Come on.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.864
- What's your problem,moron?
- Not looking again,dude.

27:56.899 --> 27:58.887
What,are you afraid you're
gonna have,like,a homo relapse?

27:58.929 --> 28:01.223
- That's what I said.
- Yeah?

28:01.265 --> 28:02.745
All right.
Whip it out.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.226
- All right,ready?
- Yeah.

28:05.853 --> 28:07.820
Oh,my god,dude.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.523
What,have you been humping a bowl of yams?

28:10.649 --> 28:12.526
- Shit.
- What the hell?

28:12.568 --> 28:13.735
Garrity's got an orange cock.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.529
Hey,I don't have an orange cock.

28:15.564 --> 28:17.281
I don'T.
It's not orange. Come on.

28:18.657 --> 28:20.457
Let me see.

28:20.492 --> 28:21.875
- No.
- Why not?

28:21.910 --> 28:22.911
I'm not letting you see.

28:22.953 --> 28:23.752
No,no.
You let them see.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.546
I want to s-let me see,man. Come on.

28:25.581 --> 28:28.166
I'm sorry. I'm not interested in
showing a black dude my johnson.

28:28.201 --> 28:30.752
Come on,man,I'm not trying to judge you.
I just want to help you.

28:30.794 --> 28:32.296
Let me check it out.

28:36.508 --> 28:37.551
All right.

28:44.474 --> 28:46.400
Ok?

28:46.435 --> 28:48.270
So what?
Is it...

28:48.312 --> 28:49.354
orange?

28:49.396 --> 28:52.482
I don't think I'd go so far as
to say your shit is orange,per se,

28:52.524 --> 28:55.318
but it's definitely a lot
darker than brothers I've seen.

28:55.353 --> 28:58.113
Well,exactly how many brothers'
cocks have you seen,brother?

28:58.148 --> 29:00.240
I was on my high school basketball team.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.305
We used to take showers
together after practice,you know.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.328
I love this reminiscing about
memory lane and all that,

29:04.369 --> 29:06.830
but seriously,my cock is the issue.
Could we please...

29:06.865 --> 29:09.291
All right,all right,all right.
Let me check it out again.

29:09.333 --> 29:10.959
- Really?
- Come on,come on.

29:10.994 --> 29:12.419
I need to see it again.

29:12.454 --> 29:14.087
Oh,my god.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.559
I'll come back.

29:20.594 --> 29:21.887
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
Whoa,probie.

29:21.929 --> 29:23.555
I need you to go get lou
and tell him to come in here.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.432
He's got to take a look at garrity's pecker.

29:25.467 --> 29:26.475
Is this a gag,

29:26.517 --> 29:29.561
or did I get assigned to the only
all-queer firehouse in new york?

29:29.603 --> 29:31.313
Could you just please do
what you're told,probie?

29:31.348 --> 29:33.190
No questions.

29:33.225 --> 29:34.531
Jesus.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.193
Probies-such assholes.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.529
Says the guy standing there
with his orange dick in his hand.

29:42.616 --> 29:44.409
- Hey,lou.
- Ah.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.914
- the guys,they need you to-
- Ahh.

29:48.949 --> 29:51.625
Well,they want you to,uh...

29:53.710 --> 29:57.130
Franco and the guys need you in the
locker room to check out garrity's pecker.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.677
Jesus. Why didn't you just say so?

30:06.390 --> 30:07.474
Ok.

30:07.516 --> 30:08.892
What is it this time?

30:08.934 --> 30:10.025
Slight discoloration.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.062
Yeah,if you consider
traffic cone orange slight.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.356
Ok,it's not that orange,lou,I promise.

30:14.391 --> 30:15.649
All right.

30:15.691 --> 30:17.880
Show me,uh,what little you got.

30:17.915 --> 30:20.070
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

30:24.283 --> 30:27.744
Why does your dick look
like a bald george hamilton?

30:27.786 --> 30:29.204
Oh,come on.
Is it that bad,really?

30:29.246 --> 30:32.332
Looks like you disconnected your dick
and sent it down to miami for the weekend.

30:32.374 --> 30:34.585
Yeah,if your dick was a
movie,it'd be "a cockwork orange. "

30:36.461 --> 30:37.337
Where you been putting that thing?

30:37.372 --> 30:38.297
Nowhere,I promise.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.798
Have you been banging
some skanky-ass bitches?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.550
No,I haven't been banging anyone,

30:41.592 --> 30:43.927
and if I did,she wouldn't be orange,ok?

30:43.962 --> 30:45.304
I've been jerking off,is all.

30:45.345 --> 30:48.056
Yeah,you might want to loosen up on
the kung-fu grip there,G.I. Junior.

30:48.091 --> 30:49.183
I think you got hand burn.

30:49.224 --> 30:51.101
Yeah. Why don't you use
some lube or something?

30:51.143 --> 30:53.437
Of course I'm using lube.
I borrowed mike's jurgens.

30:53.472 --> 30:54.771
Which jurgens?

30:54.813 --> 30:56.565
What do you mean,which jurgens?
Jurgens is jurgens,right?

30:56.607 --> 30:58.400
No,no,no,no. There's the jergens moisturizer

30:58.442 --> 31:00.110
and the jurgens self-tanner,dude,

31:00.152 --> 31:02.821
and both tubes look pretty much identical.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.868
I guess that would explain,then,

31:07.903 --> 31:10.120
my predicament down here.

31:10.155 --> 31:11.955
And here.

31:16.502 --> 31:18.462
Is it too soon to request a transfer?

31:26.386 --> 31:27.978
Hey.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.598
I'm not stealing your leftovers.

31:29.633 --> 31:31.350
Christ,chief,look at me.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.435
There are no leftovers.

31:33.470 --> 31:34.853
You got a second?

31:34.888 --> 31:35.819
Yeah.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.106
Listen. Is it about the franco-lesbo fight?

31:38.148 --> 31:41.568
Because I floated the idea past some
of our bigger bettors,and they love it!

31:41.603 --> 31:44.321
No. That's-that's good,but
no,it's not about that.

31:44.363 --> 31:45.656
It's something personal.

31:45.697 --> 31:47.491
- You all right?
- Yeah. No,I'm fine.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.993
Look. You probably heard
through the grapevine already,

31:50.035 --> 31:52.246
you know,I'm getting
married in a couple days.

31:52.281 --> 31:54.164
I've been hearing whispers.

31:54.206 --> 31:56.131
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.335
Thank you. But look. It's
really-it's no big thing.

31:58.377 --> 32:00.671
It's gonna be a small civil union.

32:00.712 --> 32:03.966
Probably gonna be at the
bar,you know,one night.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.135
I wanted to ask you

32:07.177 --> 32:08.470
if you would,

32:08.512 --> 32:11.223
you know,stand up for me,be my best man.

32:11.258 --> 32:13.267
Jesus,lou.

32:13.308 --> 32:15.269
I'm touched.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.444
I mean,I know we go back,

32:17.479 --> 32:20.364
but I never thought you thought about me...

32:20.399 --> 32:23.944
- I would be honored to do that for you.
- Thank you.

32:23.986 --> 32:25.362
But I got to ask,

32:25.404 --> 32:27.426
why not tommy?

32:27.461 --> 32:29.414
Well,uh...

32:29.449 --> 32:32.452
let's just say tommy's not 100% behind,uh,

32:32.487 --> 32:35.455
the notion of me marrying an ex-hooker who,

32:35.497 --> 32:38.584
you know,once upon a time
took all my money and vanished.

32:38.619 --> 32:40.919
- Some guys just don't get it.
- No.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.130
Still,I mean,he's your best pal.
He's not gonna be in your wedding?

32:43.172 --> 32:44.756
Oh,no,he'll be there.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.390
But not the best man?

32:46.425 --> 32:48.594
Well,he's the best man in theory.

32:48.635 --> 32:49.970
Then what the hell am I doing there?

32:50.012 --> 32:51.930
You're gonna be the best man buffer.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.600
See,I need a buffer in case things go south.

32:54.635 --> 32:55.934
- Buffer's got to get in there-
- Ok.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.770
Stop saying "buffer. " Just
calm down. I understand.

32:58.812 --> 33:01.321
And,lou,I support your decision,ok?

33:01.356 --> 33:03.963
But just devil's advocate
here for a minute,all right?

33:03.998 --> 33:06.570
Tommy's a prickly son of a
bitch,we all know that,but

33:06.605 --> 33:07.988
maybe he's got a point.

33:08.030 --> 33:10.866
I mean,underneath that
nasty,rude veneer of his,

33:10.901 --> 33:12.451
he is just looking out for you.

33:12.493 --> 33:13.709
Yeah,look.

33:13.744 --> 33:16.914
I spent enough sleepless nights staring
up at the ceiling about this,you know.

33:16.955 --> 33:20.959
Am I doing the right thing? I
mean,marriage again?For christ's sakes.

33:21.543 --> 33:24.087
And then I look at her...

33:24.922 --> 33:28.217
and I think to myself,"my god,I could
have this for the rest of my life?

33:28.252 --> 33:31.345
I mean,I got to be the
luckiest man on earth. "

33:31.380 --> 33:33.520
Believe me,I know.

33:33.555 --> 33:35.641
You're looking at a guy that went online,

33:35.682 --> 33:40.479
found a 5'9" blonde russian broad
to spend the rest of his life with.

33:40.514 --> 33:43.524
My friend,i am your buffer.

33:43.565 --> 33:46.026
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.111
I'd do anything for you,pal.

33:48.153 --> 33:51.031
- Really?
- You just name it.

33:51.824 --> 33:54.493
- Because I just had this one more thing.
- Shoot.

33:54.535 --> 33:57.621
Could you tell tommy he's
not gonna be my best man?

33:57.656 --> 33:59.838
Oh,I'm not doing that.

33:59.873 --> 34:02.543
- All you got to do is say,like-
- I'm not doing that.

34:02.578 --> 34:04.545
Get yourself another buffer.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.386
Yo,dawg,you want a ride home?

34:06.421 --> 34:08.715
Ok. Do you see a tail hanging out of my ass?

34:08.757 --> 34:10.724
No. Ok?I'm nobody's dog.

34:10.759 --> 34:12.636
Stop playing.
You know you're my dawg.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.895
Listen.
What is it with you,anyways?

34:14.929 --> 34:18.225
It's not even wednesday,you're almost
over your quota for the week,right?

34:18.260 --> 34:20.060
But me and col were gonna watch a movie.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.896
And wait,wait.
Hold up. You see,that was a move-in day.

34:22.938 --> 34:23.981
So that doesn't count.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.274
No,no.
Moving day counts.

34:25.309 --> 34:26.406
Every time counts.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.819
See,I don't care if you're just
dropping off flowers. It counts.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.281
You could be a half a block away and
just getting lunch,and that counts,ok?

34:32.322 --> 34:34.949
Besides,the whole idea was she was
gonna be spending more time on her own.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.034
That's why she got her own place.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.911
You guys are spending more time together.

34:37.953 --> 34:39.580
Shit,you got me,man.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.588
No,she's got you by the balls.

34:41.623 --> 34:45.002
Female gavin 101.
Hang on. Damn it!

34:47.629 --> 34:48.303
Yeah.

34:48.338 --> 34:50.507
I need you to come over and fix my sink.

34:50.542 --> 34:53.152
Ok.
That's your super's job.

34:53.187 --> 34:55.726
No!
My super is super-creepy.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.347
Ok.
I got a little headline for you,ok?

34:57.389 --> 34:58.856
It's part of their job description.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.350
"Make sure that your ass crack
is hanging out of your pants,

35:00.392 --> 35:03.520
make sure you got,like,6 or 7 coffee
stains on your t-shirt,and,you know,

35:03.562 --> 35:05.939
you're creepy. " Ok?That's-

35:05.974 --> 35:08.317
Tommy,please?It's disgusting.

35:08.358 --> 35:10.993
Ok.
I- I'm coming.

35:11.028 --> 35:14.406
Looks like I'm not the only one who's
got their balls caught on the vise grip.

35:15.199 --> 35:16.658
Ok,drop me off at sheila'S.

35:17.451 --> 35:21.003
Only if move-in day don't count.

35:21.038 --> 35:23.624
Boy,you're starting to think like a gavin.

35:23.659 --> 35:24.917
Black irish,baby.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.586
Ha!
So funny. Ha.

35:35.302 --> 35:38.722
- There you go.
- Thanks.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.975
Oh,boy.

35:43.227 --> 35:45.062
This thing's a pain in the ass.

35:54.071 --> 35:55.829
What?

35:55.864 --> 35:58.617
So you're not gonna say anything?

35:58.652 --> 36:02.037
What about,my creepy super?

36:03.121 --> 36:07.125
Tommy,the sink was not a euphemism.

36:07.709 --> 36:11.129
Ok?Damian can't or won't
come over and fix anything,

36:11.171 --> 36:13.632
I'm totally useless with a wrench,

36:13.674 --> 36:16.844
and that super-creepy super-just
stares at my tits the whole time

36:16.879 --> 36:19.096
that we're talking,unless,of
course,on the rare occasion

36:19.137 --> 36:22.272
that he is ogling my ass.

36:22.307 --> 36:25.310
Really?
Can you stop staring at my tits?

36:26.812 --> 36:30.315
You know,you can't see your ass
in the position you're sitting in.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.113
So the sink wasn't

36:36.155 --> 36:39.449
an excuse to get me over
here to talk about the,uh,

36:39.491 --> 36:42.161
janet situation?

36:42.202 --> 36:44.496
Nope.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.590
Listen.

36:56.633 --> 36:59.678
It's a lose-lose situation for me.
If I pick her,I lose you.

36:59.720 --> 37:05.267
If I pick you,I lose her and
access to katy and the baby.

37:05.976 --> 37:07.603
That's what it's about.

37:07.644 --> 37:10.898
It's about the baby and katy-

37:10.933 --> 37:14.109
mostly katy right now.

37:16.987 --> 37:19.031
It is.

37:22.576 --> 37:25.204
Go ahead,say-say it.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.748
Furniture.

37:30.501 --> 37:33.712
What,you want me to move stuff?

37:33.754 --> 37:41.220
Food,furniture,smitten.

37:43.639 --> 37:45.856
I have no idea what
you're talking about now.

37:45.891 --> 37:48.810
I got to get this done,and
I got to get out of here,so...

37:48.845 --> 37:51.772
See,that's how it works for me.

37:51.807 --> 37:54.942
A fine italian sofa,

37:54.983 --> 37:57.326
couple of glasses of wine,

37:57.361 --> 38:01.240
fresh handmade pasta in a white sauce,

38:01.281 --> 38:08.205
and a man that I am so begoggled by that

38:08.247 --> 38:13.091
just the sight of his ass
in the right pair of jeans

38:13.126 --> 38:17.304
or a glimpse of his shoulder
bursting from a short sleeve

38:17.339 --> 38:26.139
is enough to make me want to tear
off all his clothes and just go.

38:26.181 --> 38:28.934
Smitten.

38:29.601 --> 38:32.187
You see...

38:32.222 --> 38:34.773
right now,

38:34.815 --> 38:37.276
that guy is you.

38:41.155 --> 38:44.164
And you leave...

38:44.199 --> 38:48.078
I'm eventually gonna find someone else.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.415
And the same goes for her.

38:51.450 --> 38:53.458
You see...

38:54.251 --> 38:58.422
you're not the only cock
on this walk,brother.

39:00.799 --> 39:03.635
But still...

39:03.677 --> 39:07.598
after all the bullshit...

39:09.516 --> 39:12.394
I still get wet

39:12.436 --> 39:15.237
when I watch you

39:15.272 --> 39:20.027
or when I hear the sound of your voice.

39:20.444 --> 39:23.572
You choose me,

39:23.614 --> 39:28.702
and you know what you're
getting both in and out of bed.

39:29.786 --> 39:33.081
You know how I kiss,

39:33.123 --> 39:36.668
you know how i taste...

39:37.461 --> 39:42.174
and I happen to know
that you like that taste.

39:43.425 --> 39:46.595
You see...

39:46.630 --> 39:49.765
the spark

39:49.806 --> 39:53.477
and the edge

39:53.519 --> 39:56.897
on that very fine line

39:56.939 --> 39:59.650
that we ride

39:59.691 --> 40:03.612
when you've got my legs hung hard

40:03.647 --> 40:07.706
around your hips

40:07.741 --> 40:12.204
and there's sweat and

40:12.239 --> 40:15.499
there's a hum...

40:18.794 --> 40:27.094
and there is this need,this
really deep hunger that,uh...

40:27.135 --> 40:33.141
is so deep that we could just
swallow each other whole...

40:33.183 --> 40:35.602
and then evaporate

40:35.644 --> 40:39.773
in ecstasy.

40:42.109 --> 40:45.779
That all goes away.

40:50.075 --> 40:54.997
And as far as my crazy train is concerned,

40:55.038 --> 40:59.501
I'm not the one who sees my dead husband.

41:01.712 --> 41:05.048
How's he doing,by the way?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
