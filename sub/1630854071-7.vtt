WEBVTT

00:00.568 --> 00:02.200
(theme music)

00:45.746 --> 00:46.945
(indistinct chatter)

00:47.081 --> 00:48.513
(phone ringing)

00:52.019 --> 00:52.951
- Oy, murdoch.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.092
- Terence meyers.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.093
To what do we owe
the pleasure this time?

01:02.129 --> 01:04.563
- Uh--
- taft is coming to town today.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.031
- The american president?
- Not an official visit.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.635
He's simply en route to his
summer home in quebec.

01:09.770 --> 01:13.238
- The prime minister has picked
our station to provide security.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.307
- Because of the trust
we've earned.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.243
- No. Only because your station
is closest to where taft

01:18.378 --> 01:19.511
Will be disembarking.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.046
- He's getting off
at the don station?

01:22.049 --> 01:24.349
By the bloody pig packers?
- Mm.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.784
The americans insisted on it.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.919
We believe it's intended
to humiliate laurier

01:27.955 --> 01:30.622
By meeting with him in the worst
possible part of toronto.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.590
- Oy!

01:33.160 --> 01:35.727
- So, I've drafted
an itinerary, gentlemen.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.762
Please familiarize
yourselves with it.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.398
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.001
A problem has arisen
on project aardvark.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.270
- Why aardvark? Oh!

01:45.405 --> 01:49.007
National security.
- No, not national security.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.076
The last one was zebra
and we're...

01:51.211 --> 01:53.345
Well, we're back to a. So...

01:56.083 --> 01:57.015
- Thank you.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.152
Suspicious death
at the telegraph office.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.920
- The one on the corner?
- Hm.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.789
- The alphabet.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.025
Very clever.
I like that.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.895
(soft music)

02:21.241 --> 02:22.641
- What have we, henry?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.176
- John doe, sir.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.311
Collapsed while he was talking
on the telephone here.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.047
- And what makes
this death suspicious?

02:29.083 --> 02:30.582
- Apparently,
the window shattered

02:30.717 --> 02:32.350
At the very moment he collapsed.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.453
More curious than suspicious,
I suppose.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.320
(clears throat)

02:36.657 --> 02:38.323
- I was here when it happened.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.258
I... I figured he'd been shot.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.160
- Mrs. Hart?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.596
- No sign of any external wound,

02:44.665 --> 02:46.464
But bleeding from the nose
and the ears.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.099
- Thank you.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.404
What else could cause that?

02:52.539 --> 02:56.208
- A severe blow to the head, but
there's no indication of such.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.745
- Hm. Well, that is curious.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.890
- I've looked everywhere, sir.
No bricks, no rocks.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.626
- Henry, windows don't simply
shatter themselves.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.629
- If something was thrown, sir,
it's gone now.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.237
- Henry, at what time
did this man collapse?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.840
- Uh... 10:15, sir.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.914
- I'd like you to stay
a little while

03:36.951 --> 03:38.850
Until you're feeling better.
Just take a seat.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.752
- Have a seat.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.022
(sighing)
- another one's just come in.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.791
- Mrs. Dunnegan.
- Hm.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.526
Dizziness as well as headache

03:48.528 --> 03:50.662
And what she calls
tummy flutter.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.931
- How many is this now?
- Five.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.934
Well, six if you include
the woman who saw angels
hovering over her.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.338
- It's very odd.
- Nurse sullivan is calling it

03:59.340 --> 04:01.306
"east end syndrome".
- East end?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.707
- That's where
most of them live.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.143
Except for mrs. Follows,
who lives near church.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.879
- Perhaps this is environmental.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.415
A localized toxin.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.183
How many are still here?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.720
- Just mrs. Dunnegan
and mrs. O'conner.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.289
- Find out exactly
where they were

04:17.424 --> 04:18.757
Before and during
their symptoms.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.725
Contact the others as well.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.294
I want to track this down.
- All right.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.730
- Bleeding out
his nose and ears?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.833
- Yes, sir. Presumably
caused by severe trauma.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.169
Yet he wasn't assaulted
at the telegraph office.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.570
- Maybe before?

04:32.606 --> 04:35.507
- Witnesses also stated
that the back window

04:35.509 --> 04:37.643
Smashed at the very moment
he collapsed.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.511
- Coincidence?
- I thought so as well,

04:39.580 --> 04:42.180
But then I found this
in his pocket.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.050
- 10-15, number eight.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.652
- The precise time and
place of his death.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.253
- Hm.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.156
- I've never seen
anything like it.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.192
His intestines have ruptured
and his lungs have collapsed.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.595
- But he had
no visible injuries.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.196
- Not just that.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.765
He wouldn't have been
able to walk

04:59.767 --> 05:01.866
Into the telegraph office
in such a condition.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.001
He could've neither stood,
nor breathed.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.839
- Yet he was alive and well
moments before he collapsed.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.876
- Somehow, this happened
to him there.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.611
I have no idea how.

05:13.881 --> 05:17.148
- Mrs. Darby lives across
the river on munro street.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.684
She left her house
at half past nine

05:19.720 --> 05:23.989
To go to her job
at the house of providence.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.024
- And who's left?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.560
- Uh, mrs. Ball.

05:28.695 --> 05:29.895
- Which one was she?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.564
- Unsettling thoughts
and stomach discomfort.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.033
- Yes. She thought she had
a ghost inside her.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.368
Where did she go?

05:36.370 --> 05:40.639
- Uh, she lives at the corner
of parliament and sydenham

05:40.641 --> 05:42.507
And was going to visit
her friend

05:42.509 --> 05:46.310
At toronto general hospital,
but she went to buy flowers

05:46.347 --> 05:48.580
On queen street at hannigan's.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.449
That's where she started
to feel funny.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.884
- Well, there it is.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.387
All of these people
start and end their trips
at different places,

05:56.423 --> 05:59.057
But they all pass through
this intersection right here.

05:59.059 --> 05:59.924
- Hm.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.726
(indistinct chatter)

06:06.066 --> 06:08.066
- Henry?
- Uh, thank you.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.469
- Have you been able
to interview everyone?

06:10.604 --> 06:12.203
- All those
I can track down, sir.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.805
(sighing)
- right.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.541
Well, let's begin with
all of those who observed

06:16.610 --> 06:18.610
Our john doe prior
to his collapse.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.879
- That would be...
- William!

06:21.982 --> 06:24.348
What are you doing here?
- Julia.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.617
What are you doing here?

06:25.752 --> 06:27.452
I thought it was a clinic day.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.020
- Well, it is, but I've become

06:29.156 --> 06:31.089
Somewhat of a detective
myself this morning.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.624
- Hm?
- I've uncovered

06:32.626 --> 06:34.426
The most unusual syndrome,

06:34.495 --> 06:38.763
Manifesting in symptoms both
physical and psychological.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.298
Well, spiritual actually.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.133
- Spiritual?
- Yes!

06:42.169 --> 06:45.102
My patients report seeing
ghosts and angels

06:45.139 --> 06:47.672
And they all passed through this
intersection at the same time.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.907
- What time was this?

06:48.976 --> 06:52.109
- Just after ten o'clock,
but it's hard to be specific.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.513
- Did any of them
happen to come

06:54.515 --> 06:56.515
Through this telegraph
office, by chance?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.282
- I don't think so. Why?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.453
- Julia, a man died here
at 10:15 this morning.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.656
He experienced severe
internal trauma

07:05.692 --> 07:08.193
And... And well...
Now you've...

07:08.996 --> 07:10.195
Henry.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.930
Of the people you interviewed,

07:11.932 --> 07:13.532
Did any of them
experience, uh...

07:13.667 --> 07:15.400
What... What are the symptoms?

07:15.535 --> 07:20.005
- Headaches, uh, internal
discomfort and apparitions.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.073
- What, like ghosts?
- Or angels.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.010
- No angels,
but I've got ghosts.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.110
Uh...

07:27.347 --> 07:29.948
A clement bragg said he felt
the ghost of our john doe

07:30.017 --> 07:31.416
Pass through him
the moment he collapsed.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.618
But I think he'd been...

07:33.620 --> 07:35.052
- Ah. Anyone else?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.224
- Yes. Mrs. Jarvis said
she wanted to help john doe,

07:39.226 --> 07:42.160
But felt the hand of god
holding her down.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.829
- Oh! Well, that's curious!

07:43.964 --> 07:46.031
- Also, one of
the switchboard operators

07:46.166 --> 07:47.632
Said she saw an aardvark, but...

07:47.767 --> 07:49.433
(chuckling)
...She was obviously a loony.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.202
- Please take us to her.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.207
- It was nothing.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.843
I just had one of
my episodes, is all.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.111
- Episodes?

08:01.315 --> 08:02.914
- They're not exactly fits.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.249
I don't fall down
and start kicking about.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.386
- You experience
petit mal seizures.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.121
- Just once in a while.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.390
I can feel them coming,

08:12.459 --> 08:16.727
I get crazy notions,
but I don't act crazy.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.865
- You say you saw an aardvark?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.666
- Just before I blacked out.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.267
It flew off.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.869
- It flew?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.604
- Well, it's some kind of bird,
isn't it?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.073
- Thank you, miss clark.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.044
- How fascinating.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.482
I suspect her seizure
was triggered by the same event

08:37.617 --> 08:40.685
That affected my patients
and your john doe.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.120
- She doesn't know what
an aardvark looks like.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.890
- Well, I'm not entirely
sure myself.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.559
- Then how could she
have seen one?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.229
- Well, certain types
of epilepsy

08:51.364 --> 08:53.698
Can cause hallucinations,
visions.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.901
- Do you think it's possible
that she overheard someone

08:56.970 --> 08:58.703
Say the word "aardvark"?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.506
- It's possible. Why?
- Because it's the name

09:01.641 --> 09:03.841
Of a secret government mission.

09:03.877 --> 09:08.045
What are the odds the word
"aardvark" would come up
twice in one day?

09:08.582 --> 09:09.413
(sighing)

09:16.456 --> 09:19.123
- Inspector,
has calvert weston arrived?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.259
- Who?
- The american attaché?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.527
- What's he look like?

09:22.662 --> 09:24.262
- If he were here,
you'd know it.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.031
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.534
- And... He's here.
Mr. Weston. Welcome to toronto.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.237
This is inspector brackenreid.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.106
- You received my telegram?

09:35.876 --> 09:36.874
- I did.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.276
We're ready to discuss
your requests.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.811
- They're not requests.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.946
They're requirements.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.547
- Mm.

09:42.682 --> 09:45.282
Which we are doing
our utmost to fulfill.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.018
- At bloody short notice,
by the way.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.488
- Perhaps it would be best if
I were to clarify our position.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.491
This meeting is at the request
of your prime minister

09:53.627 --> 09:55.160
And serves canadian interests.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.595
President taft agreed because
he's already in the country

09:57.631 --> 10:00.198
For personal reasons
and views this a courtesy.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.766
- That is understood.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.901
- It has no official bearing,
and any undertaking

10:03.937 --> 10:06.537
Will be devoid of effect and,
as you know,

10:06.607 --> 10:09.040
This is the president's first
visit outside the united states

10:09.175 --> 10:11.375
Since mexico and we do not want
a repeat of what happened there.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.878
- Of course. Security
is our highest priority.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.648
- To that end, I am in charge
of every person seconded to me

10:16.717 --> 10:19.050
And that includes you and
the employees of this station.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.785
- Now, hold on!
- Understood.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.187
- This visit will be conducted
with absolute secrecy.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.056
No press. No photographs.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.926
The president will have
no physical contact with
any other person,

10:28.061 --> 10:29.393
Save your prime minister,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.196
Who will be afforded
a single handshake

10:31.331 --> 10:32.997
Upon arrival and departure.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.266
Any breach and this visit
will be aborted.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.535
Is there any of this that is
not understood and accepted?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.905
- It was understood. Yeah.
- Understood.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.609
- The president's train
will arrive in one hour
and 50 minutes.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.843
Let us proceed.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.013
(clears throat)
- we need to talk.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.147
- Another time, murdoch.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.017
- It has to do with
your aardvark project.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.888
- You go on ahead.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.622
- You want me to go with him?
- Mm, yeah.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.358
Sorry.
- Excuse me, doctor.

11:05.932 --> 11:06.831
- What do you know?

11:07.801 --> 11:08.966
- A man is dead.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.435
- Others have been sickened.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.371
- Wasn't supposed to be lethal.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.173
Hm.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.241
(door closing)

11:17.977 --> 11:19.978
So, last fall,

11:19.980 --> 11:22.180
Several employees
at our toronto headquarters

11:22.182 --> 11:24.916
Started experiencing periods
of acute discomfort,

11:24.918 --> 11:27.251
Which subsided
after a moment or two.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.987
We assumed it was the belgians.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.523
- The belgians?
- Yes, their consulate

11:31.658 --> 11:33.324
Is directly across the street.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.727
- And you don't trust them.
- Pff. Does anyone?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.262
- Uh, you believe the belgians

11:37.397 --> 11:39.931
Created some kind
of secret weapon?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.199
- We did.
But we were wrong.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.803
It turned out that these attacks

11:44.805 --> 11:47.972
Were emanating from a sump pump
that had become unbolted

11:48.041 --> 11:49.474
In the building's basement.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.076
- And the vibrations travelled
through the building?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.311
- Exactly.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.347
Once the sump pump was
reattached, the problem stopped.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.815
But it got us thinking.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.218
What if it could be a weapon?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.585
- Of course it did.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.622
- Now, the potential for crowd
control was obvious,

12:04.624 --> 12:07.025
But there were other
applications, as well.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.692
- Such as murder.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.361
- This will go a lot faster

12:10.363 --> 12:11.629
If you let me do
the talking, murdoch.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.330
- Hm?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.368
- We contracted
a german scientist

12:17.504 --> 12:20.638
By the name of klaus meisner
to design the device.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.174
- What frequencies is he using?

12:23.243 --> 12:26.377
- Uh, between 10 and 20 cycles
per second,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.312
13 being the default.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.714
- So, below human hearing.
- Yeah.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.649
It was a fortunate coincidence
that the frequency

12:31.718 --> 12:34.519
With the greatest effect also
turned out to be undetectable.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.053
- And what is the effect?

12:36.590 --> 12:37.589
- Discomfort.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.123
Nausea. Headache, mostly.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.126
- Well, that would align with
the experience of my patients.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.828
- I tested it myself.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.798
It's unpleasant, to be sure,
but certainly not deadly.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.066
- And yet, a man is dead.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.068
In manners and circumstance

12:51.104 --> 12:53.938
Deeply connected
to this project aardvark.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.008
- So, there's something else
you should know.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.144
These devices have been stolen.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.813
We assume by klaus meisner.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.682
We also assume that he's
responsible for this murder.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.219
- Well, I wish you luck.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.288
I need to get back
to the clinic.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.756
- Oh! Are you sure?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.891
(sighing)
- my mystery's solved.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.760
Sounds like yours
is just beginning.

13:15.895 --> 13:16.927
(chuckling)

13:20.567 --> 13:22.166
- Shall we start
with this john doe?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.167
- Yes.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.440
- Oh.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.643
- Do you know this man?

13:32.712 --> 13:35.613
- Yes, I do.
This is klaus meisner.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.651
(dramatic music)

13:43.122 --> 13:45.790
- Why did you think
klaus meisner was behind this?

13:47.093 --> 13:48.926
- He was kicking up a fuss.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.195
Suggested the program
be canceled,

13:51.198 --> 13:53.464
The emitters destroyed.
- Why?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.901
- Believe me, murdoch,
if I knew, I would tell you.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.137
- Where did he work?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.307
- I'll take you.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.578
(soft music)

14:09.816 --> 14:11.949
- We're on the top floor?
- Yes.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.685
- The floor below is to be
cleared and locked off.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.087
No one is to enter.
- I'll get my men on it.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.757
- That would require me
to trust their competence.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.425
Your men will patrol
the periphery.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.862
Two on the roof,
another two in each stairwell.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.462
Armed, of course.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.232
Make it shotguns.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.700
Less chance of missing.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.036
You give me ten men
and I'll pick six.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.639
We'll go with that chair.
It's more sturdy.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.708
The president has a bad back.
Now, where's the telephone?

14:36.843 --> 14:37.709
(snapping fingers)

14:39.045 --> 14:40.979
I'm expecting a call
from the first lady.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.314
- Who?
- The president's wife.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.649
- Ah.
- The call will be coming

14:44.651 --> 14:45.850
At five o'clock.

14:45.852 --> 14:46.985
You tell the front desk

14:47.120 --> 14:48.585
To make sure that line is open.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.158
(dramatic music)

14:55.195 --> 14:56.861
(horse snorting)

14:59.132 --> 15:01.132
- What time did meisner die?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.800
- 10:15. Why?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.135
- Yeah.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.070
I was here at 11:00
looking for him.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.274
Left that in the door jam.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.942
- Someone's been here.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.644
- And may still be here.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.417
You!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.352
Step into view with
your hands raised!

15:27.027 --> 15:29.894
- Alexander graham bell!

15:29.963 --> 15:33.697
- Detective murdoch!
What a sur... Prise!

15:34.668 --> 15:36.234
I'm sorry.
I don't believe we've met.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.235
- Uh, mr. Bell,
this is terence--

15:38.305 --> 15:39.770
- He doesn't need
to know my name.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.238
What are you doing here,
mr. Bell?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.708
- I came at the request
of klaus meisner.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.042
- For what purpose?

15:45.111 --> 15:48.179
- Well, he wanted to use
an instrument I'd built

15:48.181 --> 15:50.247
To measure subsonic vibrations.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.650
May I ask what
all this is about?

15:52.785 --> 15:56.387
- We believe a subsonic
wave emitter

15:56.456 --> 15:59.657
Built by klaus meisner
was used to kill him.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.258
- That's still speculation,
murdoch.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.261
- Klaus is dead?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.528
My god.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.131
I... I spoke to him
just this morning.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.599
He was supposed
to meet me here at noon.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.201
(sighing)

16:10.270 --> 16:13.103
Is this the emitter?
- It is.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.941
And, unfortunately, the only one
left in our possession.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.710
Gentlemen, would you like
a demonstration?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.112
- All right.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.185
- Uh, hmm...

16:28.989 --> 16:30.421
Stand no closer than ten feet,

16:30.457 --> 16:33.090
Or you will experience the worst
headache of your life.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.158
- Ah.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.163
(clears throat)

16:41.735 --> 16:42.933
- Ready?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.101
- Yes.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.903
(whirring)

16:45.905 --> 16:46.971
(beeping)

16:47.106 --> 16:49.140
(whirring)

16:49.275 --> 16:50.708
(moaning)

16:50.777 --> 16:52.976
Whoa. That's enough for me.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.117
- Oh! Ha!

17:00.053 --> 17:01.318
(whirring stops)
- I must confess,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.454
I had to retain strict control
over certain muscles

17:03.589 --> 17:05.923
I only have the excuse
to use once a day.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.357
- Common symptom.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.894
Some agents couldn't
maintain any control,

17:09.963 --> 17:12.463
So, as you can see,
effective crowd control,

17:12.499 --> 17:13.931
But even at this close range,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.333
The waves produced
are not fatal.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.869
- Yes, but klaus meisner
is dead.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.673
- What if several machines
were aimed at him?

17:22.675 --> 17:25.810
- Well, their waves would likely
interfere with each other

17:25.812 --> 17:27.411
And cancel each other out.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.481
- Ah, if they were to converge
at peak amplitude.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.418
- Peak what?
- Well, if the emitters

17:34.421 --> 17:37.555
Were equidistant, huh,

17:37.557 --> 17:40.891
And fired synchronously,

17:40.927 --> 17:44.962
The wave peaks would converge

17:45.098 --> 17:46.831
At a single point.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.634
The resulting amplitude
would be the sum of each.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.504
- So, say, ten emitters
precisely arrayed

17:53.506 --> 17:55.706
Would produce an amplitude
ten times greater

17:55.775 --> 17:57.541
At the point of convergence.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.312
- Yes, but keep in mind
that the intensity

18:01.381 --> 18:06.283
Will diminish to the square root
of the distance.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.052
- Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.189
- Just how many machines
are missing, meyers?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.527
- 78.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.929
- 78?!

18:17.931 --> 18:18.996
Oh!

18:18.998 --> 18:21.132
- I suppose that could
kill a man.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.669
- Is this it? One vehicle?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.737
- It was our understanding
only the president

18:26.873 --> 18:28.873
And his driver would be leaving
from the station.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.841
- In full view
with no protection?

18:32.478 --> 18:35.012
I want three cars:
One in the front, one following.

18:35.014 --> 18:38.382
There will be no stopping
between the station and
the dominion hotel.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.621
- These are meisner's notes
on the emitters.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.158
- It seems he had
the same idea as you, mr. Bell.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.560
He'd even worked out
the interference patterns.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.964
- I would have thought as much.
- He was serious about this.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.098
- Hmm.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.167
- What are you two
talking about?

18:56.236 --> 18:58.369
What the devil is
an interference pattern?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.237
- Well, when waves interact,

19:00.306 --> 19:03.641
They either amplify
or destroy one another,

19:03.710 --> 19:07.244
Creating nodes of
high and low amplitude.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.447
Rather beautiful geometry, hmm?

19:10.449 --> 19:12.116
- Which would explain
the effect on the people

19:12.185 --> 19:15.386
Outside the telegraph office
when mr. Meisner collapsed.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.955
They each occupied
a different node.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.790
- That makes sense.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.793
- Oh!

19:23.663 --> 19:24.795
Oh, it's a film.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.602
That's klaus meisner.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.273
It appears he's conducting
an experiment.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.608
- Perhaps he's testing
his theories?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.544
- Who is that?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.080
- Meisner's assistant,
rupert lamar.

19:43.082 --> 19:46.016
- Where is he now?
- We have yet to locate him.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.724
Good lord.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.026
It can make you burst!?!

19:59.032 --> 20:01.899
- I believe
the wavelength emitted

20:02.034 --> 20:04.769
Matched the resonant frequency
of the watermelon,

20:04.904 --> 20:08.839
Much like the voice of a soprano
could shatter a wine glass.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.577
- So, what would be the resonant
frequency of the human body?

20:13.646 --> 20:16.180
- Different organs
and materials would have...

20:16.182 --> 20:18.249
Different natural frequencies,
but I suspect,

20:18.384 --> 20:21.318
Given what we've seen, that it
would be in the subsonic range.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.522
- If meisner was targeted, how?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.392
Having separate waveforms
converge at a single point

20:28.394 --> 20:32.996
Would require absolute precision
in both location and timing.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.665
- So how could they
possibly know

20:34.701 --> 20:37.334
He was going to position himself
in exactly the right place?

20:37.470 --> 20:38.669
- Very true.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.936
A few feet to the side

20:39.973 --> 20:42.073
And the effects would have
been very different.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.810
- Wait! He was at a specific
place and time.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.479
He was on the telephone.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.680
- Of course.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.481
Whoever triggered the devices

20:51.517 --> 20:53.817
Was possibly on the phone
with him at the time.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.954
- How? Did he...
Did he call them?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.823
- Or they called him?

21:00.727 --> 21:03.927
This note was found
in klaus meisner's pocket,

21:03.963 --> 21:05.896
The man who died earlier.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.699
- That's right.
Telephone number eight at 10:15.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.568
- Yes. Now, what I need to know

21:10.703 --> 21:12.969
Is who was on the other end
of that call?

21:13.006 --> 21:16.239
Or, at the very least, whether
it was placed, or received.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.642
- I can do you better than that.

21:20.479 --> 21:24.782
The call came from fp 412 from
a man called grant taylor.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.251
- How did you--
- mr. Meisner was expecting

21:27.320 --> 21:28.985
A call in booth eight
and wanted to know

21:29.022 --> 21:31.621
Who was going to be calling,
so I wrote it down.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.223
- Huh.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.692
Mr. Taylor...

21:36.829 --> 21:40.064
How is it that a witness
to mr. Meisner's collapse

21:40.066 --> 21:43.600
At the very same time called him

21:43.602 --> 21:45.936
From a telephone
three blocks away?

21:47.173 --> 21:49.273
- I've nothing to say.
- Oh, come now, mr. Taylor.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.042
It was your phone call
that ensured his death.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.545
You could be facing the noose.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.012
- I've nothing to say.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.489
- Put him in the cells.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.626
- So, we know the waveforms

22:08.628 --> 22:12.029
Converged at the telegraph
office here.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.697
- So you're saying
the emitters are located

22:13.766 --> 22:15.433
Along these concentric
lines here?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.501
- Mm-hmm.
- How far apart are these?

22:17.503 --> 22:21.671
- 87 feet, which corresponds
to 13 cycles per second.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.575
- Let's start kicking down
some doors.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.176
(rumbling)

22:26.212 --> 22:27.845
Something's happening. I...

22:27.914 --> 22:29.580
- Oh, move! Both of you!

22:29.715 --> 22:31.315
(dramatic music)

22:32.218 --> 22:34.084
- I believe we're under attack.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.720
(glass breaking)
(sizzling)

22:35.855 --> 22:38.055
(breathing heavily)

22:38.190 --> 22:40.124
- It's not that severe.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.926
We must be inside
one of the nodes,

22:41.928 --> 22:43.861
But we're not
the intended target.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.363
The cells!

22:49.669 --> 22:51.034
(door opening)

22:52.605 --> 22:54.872
(dramatic music)

23:13.826 --> 23:15.759
I don't understand.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.629
If the emitters were set
along these lines

23:18.698 --> 23:22.699
In order to converge
at the telegraph office here,

23:22.701 --> 23:25.002
Then how were they able
to converge

23:25.071 --> 23:27.671
At our station house here
a block away?

23:29.275 --> 23:31.842
- Could they have relocated
every emitter?

23:31.878 --> 23:34.611
- No. That would be impossible
with such short notice.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.313
- Mm.
- And mr. Taylor was only

23:36.349 --> 23:38.249
In our station house for,
what, 15 minutes?

23:38.384 --> 23:41.518
- Perhaps our assumptions
were wrong.

23:41.554 --> 23:44.788
Meisner's emitters can fire at
a range of wavelengths, correct?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.924
- Correct.
- And they're able to swivel

23:46.926 --> 23:48.993
On their bases in any direction.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.395
- But in order to be effective,

23:51.397 --> 23:53.130
They have to have
their peak amplitudes

23:53.265 --> 23:55.199
Converge at a single point.

23:55.201 --> 23:59.270
- So, if each emitter was made
to face a specific target

23:59.405 --> 24:02.339
And emit a specific wavelength,

24:02.408 --> 24:04.808
Then they could target
anyone within range?

24:04.811 --> 24:08.212
- They would have
to recalibrate the...
The emitters very quickly.

24:08.214 --> 24:12.115
- They must be set up
to communicate wirelessly
or something.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.220
- Rupert lamar,
meisner's assistant,

24:16.289 --> 24:18.689
Was an expert
in wireless transmission.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.558
But... It makes no sense.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.459
They were like father and son.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.562
Why would he kill his mentor?

24:24.564 --> 24:27.431
- And how did they know taylor
was in our cells?

24:27.433 --> 24:30.568
Unless he triggered
the device himself.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.436
- Unless he was merely a dupe.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.104
And, if so, of whom?

24:34.106 --> 24:37.808
- Detective, my recorder
is sonically activated

24:37.810 --> 24:40.777
Whenever a vibration exceeds
a certain threshold.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.746
- Is it possible
you've recorded it, then?

24:46.118 --> 24:47.984
- Gentlemen, we are in luck.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.657
We may be able to determine
how the emitters are arrayed

24:53.659 --> 24:56.760
Based on relative amplitude
and frequency.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.129
Eureka.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.597
I'd best get to work.

25:05.771 --> 25:08.873
- I found something interesting
on mr. Taylor's finger.

25:09.708 --> 25:10.941
A tattoo.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.342
It was obscured by his ring.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.880
- We've seen that before.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.482
- Indeed, we have.

25:19.552 --> 25:22.218
- Three weeks ago,
we uncovered evidence

25:22.255 --> 25:23.754
Of a group of rogue agents

25:23.889 --> 25:26.423
Calling themselves
the soldiers of columbia.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.026
They're led by a former agent.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.428
You know him as allen clegg.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.898
- Clegg? That's impossible.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.634
Clegg is dead.
We've seen proof.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.569
- Is this the proof you've seen?

25:38.638 --> 25:41.104
The tattoo was
identical to this.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.240
But, surely, allen clegg
didn't survive rabies

25:44.277 --> 25:46.777
And a tumble over niagara falls.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.446
- The soldiers of columbia
are more than one man.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.315
You may recall we found
the same tattoo

25:51.450 --> 25:54.318
On the hand of agent morris.
- It is their symbol.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.053
- In any case, they've made
their intentions clear:

25:57.089 --> 25:59.523
They want america to invade
and annex canada.

25:59.658 --> 26:02.326
- And what better provocation
than the assassination

26:02.328 --> 26:04.728
Of the american president
on canadian soil

26:04.863 --> 26:08.265
Using a covert weapon developed
by the canadian secret service?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.499
(sighing)

26:10.770 --> 26:12.603
- We need to talk
to prime minister laurier.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.875
- And we're certain taft
is the target?

26:17.877 --> 26:19.610
- All we know for certain

26:19.745 --> 26:22.278
Is that the soldiers of columbia
are involved.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.748
- This is the worst news
at the worst possible time.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.683
- Yes, sir.
We will have to cancel.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.353
- No, it's too late to cancel.
They've already disembarked
from the train.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.787
They'll be here
in a matter of minutes.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.757
- Well, then we will
inform them upon arrival.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.292
- Would that even help?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.594
Didn't you just tell me
that these devices...

26:37.630 --> 26:39.430
- Emitters.
- ...Can target anyone anywhere?

26:39.432 --> 26:40.831
- Not exactly, sir.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.101
Each emitter has to be
individually recalibrated

26:44.170 --> 26:46.637
For each new location.
It takes time.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.973
- Then, as long as taft
keeps moving, he'll be safe.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.476
- Sir--
- look, you saw how they reacted

26:52.545 --> 26:53.577
To mexico.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.979
Consider the repercussions
for canada

26:56.048 --> 26:57.881
If this plot is ever revealed.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.584
Remember, we need
this trade agreement

27:00.653 --> 27:02.252
Far more than the americans do.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.453
(phone ringing)

27:12.965 --> 27:14.531
President taft is arriving.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.534
This meeting is for less than
an hour, followed by cocktails.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.069
We'll keep him moving.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.673
- Sir, he'll want to sit down.
- Then we'll change the seats.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.241
And at all times,
I'll keep close to him.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.911
If he dies, I die too.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.214
And, in the meantime,
find those damned emitters.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.417
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.840
- All right, lads.
Remember what we talked about.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.508
No one gets near the president.

27:58.544 --> 27:59.776
- I'll inform the inspector.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.578
- I'll see if mr. Bell's
had any luck.

28:01.580 --> 28:02.979
- Hmm. Let me through.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.048
- Sorry, sir.
- Oh, for... Thomas!

28:06.085 --> 28:07.551
- Bloody hell, evans,
let him through.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.486
- So, we have a problem.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.722
- Mind the curb, sir.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.457
(grunts)
your back hurt, sir?

28:13.459 --> 28:14.992
- My nose hurts worse.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.793
- There was a pork-packing plant
to the south.

28:16.929 --> 28:20.197
- Well, how many hogs
does it take to create
a smell like that?

28:20.199 --> 28:21.665
- It must be
in the thousands, sir.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.801
- Hm. They're an industrious
people, weston.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.869
But lacking in presentation.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.605
- Are we really going
through with this?

28:28.674 --> 28:31.608
- Laurier doesn't want a repeat
of what happened in mexico.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.277
- What did happen in mexico?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.011
- A man was found ten feet away

28:35.013 --> 28:37.147
From taft and diaz
with a palm pistol.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.549
- Ooh! That's not good.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.617
- It was very much a non-event.

28:40.619 --> 28:43.220
No attempt was made on his life,
but, of course,

28:43.222 --> 28:45.622
The americans used it very much
to their advantage.

28:49.661 --> 28:52.295
- Any luck, mr. Bell?
- Well, as you know,

28:52.364 --> 28:56.033
I intended to infer
the source from the amplitude
and frequencies.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.502
- And?
- Impossible.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.437
In fact, might I say
blooming impossible.

29:01.474 --> 29:05.175
I was ready to call it quits
when I discovered this.

29:07.613 --> 29:10.447
It starts exactly three minutes
before the attack.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.584
Each pulse separated
by one second.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.553
And each a unique wavelength.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.791
- The emitters are firing
in sequence.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.661
I believe we're looking
at the primary wave.

29:24.663 --> 29:27.263
And this is the secondary phase.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.465
- Of course.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.735
- They're arrayed
in straight lines.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.907
- By jove. Yes! Two lines

29:37.042 --> 29:39.342
Arrayed at right angles
to each other!

29:39.411 --> 29:40.810
- Right.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.913
If this is
the station house, uh...

29:45.017 --> 29:46.784
What's the longest wavelength?

29:46.919 --> 29:51.688
- Uh, 13.2, two wavelengths,
171 feet.

29:51.824 --> 29:56.026
- So, if we assume the direction
of the telegraph office...

29:58.631 --> 30:00.864
171...

30:02.434 --> 30:05.902
...Puts us at the intersection
of sumach and queen street.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.438
- And the shortest is 100 feet.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.308
- What's all this?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.444
- We found out that the emitters
are arrayed in two lines

30:14.446 --> 30:16.713
Intersecting
at this corner here.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.916
- 100 feet puts us
at the western edge

30:18.918 --> 30:20.450
Of the dominion hotel.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.720
- Where taft and laurier
are meeting.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.756
- Could the emitters be hidden
in the hotel itself?

30:26.792 --> 30:29.092
- Only the top two floors
have been secured.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.995
The soldiers of columbia
could have rented every room
in the bottom two.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.196
- Right.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.265
Please continue
your calculations, mr. Bell.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.600
Henry! Come with us!

30:39.738 --> 30:42.205
(dramatic music)

30:42.241 --> 30:45.074
- You check the basement. I'll
start in on the first floor.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.244
Murdoch?
- I'll be right there.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.636
(suspenseful music)

31:12.771 --> 31:14.437
(gun cocking)

31:24.383 --> 31:25.615
- Sit down!

31:31.757 --> 31:33.657
(rattling)

31:37.863 --> 31:39.663
- Allen clegg.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.801
- Well...

31:47.206 --> 31:48.872
Hello, detective.

31:57.015 --> 32:00.216
I must confess I'm delighted
to see you, detective.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.285
- Oh? Why is that?

32:02.354 --> 32:05.621
- Because as long as you're
here, you're not out there.

32:05.658 --> 32:08.425
You see, you no longer present
the threat of discovery.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.894
You should be happy, as well,

32:11.029 --> 32:13.163
Because you now have
a front row seat

32:13.232 --> 32:16.233
To a defining moment in history.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.968
- And what defines this moment?

32:19.004 --> 32:20.837
Your failure?

32:20.839 --> 32:22.372
Your arrests?

32:22.408 --> 32:24.507
Your execution?

32:25.744 --> 32:28.378
- I had forgotten what
a charming conversationalist

32:28.513 --> 32:29.812
You are, detective.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.516
Yes, there will be
an execution,

32:32.651 --> 32:36.119
President taft, of course,
but, uh, you, as well.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.588
It's an unfortunate necessity,
I'm afraid.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.458
But I would like you to know,
detective, that I harbour

32:41.460 --> 32:44.861
No ill will
towards you personally.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.464
- We know about
your secret weapon.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.734
And we also know
its limitations.

32:50.736 --> 32:55.605
You can aim at a specific point,
but not a moving target.

32:55.741 --> 33:00.811
- Well, president taft
is rather a rotund fellow.

33:00.813 --> 33:06.016
How is it, exactly,
that you intend on keeping him
moving for a full hour?

33:06.085 --> 33:07.818
- We don't have to.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.019
Each time he moves,

33:10.055 --> 33:13.223
You have to adjust
every one of your emitters.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.292
That's 78 separate measurements,

33:16.328 --> 33:19.029
78 separate calculations

33:19.098 --> 33:21.297
And 78 commands.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.667
- It's one measurement
repeated 78 times.

33:25.871 --> 33:26.970
They're arrayed in straight
lines, equidistant.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.805
The same function
applies to all.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.174
It only takes a few minutes
to reset every emitter.

33:31.309 --> 33:34.544
- Yes. We recorded
your test transmissions.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.182
I know the exact wavelength
of each of your emitters.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.583
- You don't know
which direction.

33:40.619 --> 33:41.852
You don't know which wave.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.120
- I was able to find you.

33:44.256 --> 33:47.590
- And yet, here you are,
all alone.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.794
Who else in that little
station house of yours

33:50.796 --> 33:52.529
Could possibly figure it out?

33:53.732 --> 33:55.532
- We have none other
than alexander graham bell

33:55.601 --> 33:58.101
Doing the calculations
as we speak.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.614
- Go down, stay down.

34:10.616 --> 34:14.017
If anyone shows up,
slit their throats.

34:26.298 --> 34:29.299
- Mr. President, I'm sure
you'll be more comfortable

34:29.301 --> 34:30.867
In the capacious wingback.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.706
It's made right here in toronto.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.241
- Are you here
to sell me a chair?

34:38.243 --> 34:40.510
- I'm here to sell you on
everything canada has to offer.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.013
- He's changed his chair. Why?

34:44.083 --> 34:46.316
- That one's got more support.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.585
I've got a bad back myself.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.120
Age.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.721
- I don't like surprises.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.257
Next time, tell me.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.401
- Ah!

35:06.505 --> 35:08.271
Did you find the emitters?
- No.

35:08.406 --> 35:10.006
They're not at the hotel.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.675
Nor are they at the brewery
next door.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.076
We even checked the barrels.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.545
- How odd!

35:15.614 --> 35:17.480
According to my calculations,

35:17.483 --> 35:20.150
They are in the immediate
vicinity of that corner!

35:20.152 --> 35:21.818
- Where's detective murdoch?

35:21.887 --> 35:23.419
(dramatic music)

35:27.292 --> 35:29.159
- What's your stake in this?

35:29.294 --> 35:32.362
You must know what these
soldiers of columbia want.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.431
- I support their aims.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.366
- You're canadian.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.236
- Canada is a pasty child,

35:39.371 --> 35:41.804
Beholden to an indifferent
mother who demands obeisance,

35:41.840 --> 35:43.473
But gives nothing in return.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.541
I'd rather be american.

35:46.678 --> 35:49.078
- So much so you'd be willing
to kill for it?

35:49.715 --> 35:51.414
- People die in war.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.384
It's the price of freedom.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.155
- It's not like I know
any of them personally.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.755
- You knew klaus meisner.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.659
- Klaus is dead?

36:02.728 --> 36:05.061
- He's your first victim.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.331
- He was to be left alone!

36:08.466 --> 36:11.133
- He was onto our plan.
It was necessary.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.169
- We had an agreement!

36:14.306 --> 36:17.340
- And I changed that agreement.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.108
- I've had enough of this.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.077
- Sit down!

36:21.146 --> 36:26.750
Be a man, swallow your grief
and do your job!

36:26.885 --> 36:28.718
Are the emitters ready?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.487
- They need to be recalibrated.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.356
- Why?
- The temperature has risen.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.825
It affects the density of air,
which affects the wavelength.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.426
- Then you'd best get at it.

36:37.462 --> 36:41.764
Because come five o'clock,
either taft dies, or you do.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.575
- Help me put a stop to this.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.044
- If we fail, he'll shoot me.

36:55.113 --> 36:58.348
If we succeed,
I'll be arrested for murder.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.251
So, either way,
my destiny's predetermined.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.857
(dramatic music)

37:07.993 --> 37:09.325
- When did you last see him?

37:09.361 --> 37:11.328
- Uh, at the front of the hotel.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.895
He didn't come in,
as far as I know.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.198
- Well, according
to my calculations,

37:16.235 --> 37:20.803
The emitters are arrayed along
the perimeter of the hotel.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.740
- They're not
there! We checked!

37:23.809 --> 37:26.743
- Could they be buried
underground?

37:29.715 --> 37:31.280
- Not buried...

37:32.084 --> 37:33.516
In the sewers!

37:34.252 --> 37:36.086
(whirring)

37:37.422 --> 37:38.755
- Another attack?
- No.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.490
It's the pre-attack
calibrations.

37:40.492 --> 37:44.494
That means another attack will
begin in exactly three minutes.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.233
- Mr. President,
I want to thank you

37:50.235 --> 37:52.435
For your generous attention
to our concerns.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.304
- Are you asking me
to move again?

37:54.306 --> 37:57.974
- I don't want to presume
to take more of your precious
time than is necessary.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.975
You'll want to be on your way,
I'm sure.

38:00.012 --> 38:03.246
- Nonsense. My wife is due
to call here at five o'clock.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.582
That has been arranged.
- It has, sir.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.418
- Then I shall continue
to rest my aching back.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.424
(dramatic music)

38:14.559 --> 38:17.060
- I'll get to taft. You two
try to disable the emitters.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.194
- Right!

38:19.264 --> 38:21.764
(clicking)

38:24.036 --> 38:26.469
(suspenseful music)

38:35.080 --> 38:36.746
- Are the emitters ready?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.681
- Just finishing now.
- Good.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.350
I'll make the call myself.

38:42.287 --> 38:43.386
(sighing)

38:44.455 --> 38:46.122
I wish I could see
the look on his face

38:46.124 --> 38:48.457
When he hears my voice
instead of his wife's.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.060
(sighing)

38:56.635 --> 38:58.501
(grunts)

38:58.537 --> 39:00.503
(panting)

39:00.572 --> 39:03.305
- What do we do?
- Well, we turn

39:03.342 --> 39:06.242
As many of the emitters
as we can in the 60 seconds!

39:09.181 --> 39:10.580
- Hello, operator.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.918
Connect me to the
dominion hotel, suite 401.

39:17.089 --> 39:19.589
(indistinct chatter)

39:19.591 --> 39:21.056
(phone ringing)

39:26.331 --> 39:28.164
- Yes?
- It's time.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.065
<i> - Ah, yes, we were expecting</i>
<i> your call.</i>

39:31.002 --> 39:33.002
Mr. President,
first lady for you.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.703
- Right on time.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.483
- No. No!

39:48.019 --> 39:49.285
No!
(grunts)

39:51.590 --> 39:52.888
(gun cocking)

39:53.825 --> 39:54.924
- Stop!

39:55.861 --> 39:57.126
- You're too late.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.296
- Hello, dear.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.568
- Goodbye, mr. President.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.303
- Who is this?

40:07.372 --> 40:10.239
(whirring, rumbling)
(grunting)

40:12.444 --> 40:13.576
- It's that phone!

40:13.645 --> 40:16.312
(dramatic music)

40:16.314 --> 40:17.647
(gasps)

40:20.352 --> 40:22.118
(grunts)
- you... You.

40:22.687 --> 40:23.686
You!

40:23.688 --> 40:25.020
(grunting)

40:25.890 --> 40:28.591
(grunts)
(screaming)

40:31.630 --> 40:32.562
(grunts)

40:32.564 --> 40:34.063
- Mr. President!
(bones cracking)

40:34.199 --> 40:36.665
Mr. President! Mr. President,
are you all right?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.167
(panting)
- my god!

40:38.236 --> 40:39.602
What were you thinking?

40:39.604 --> 40:41.070
- I saved the president's life!

40:41.072 --> 40:42.739
- Sincere apologies, sir.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.440
He saw I had a gun
and didn't know

40:44.575 --> 40:46.142
I was canadian secret service.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.211
- I've never seen this man
before in my life.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.947
- My back!
- Did he injure you, sir?

40:51.016 --> 40:52.381
- Quite the opposite.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.183
I believe he's cured it.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.888
(grunts)

41:08.433 --> 41:10.232
(whirring)

41:10.268 --> 41:13.502
(grunts)

41:16.842 --> 41:19.008
(whirring stops)

41:38.096 --> 41:39.729
- I just saved your life.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.464
And that of the american
president.

41:41.599 --> 41:43.332
- I'm very much aware of that,

41:43.401 --> 41:46.402
Facts that I will make clear
to the crown attorney.

41:47.239 --> 41:48.671
But you can't possibly think

41:48.673 --> 41:50.473
That you're going
to walk away from this.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.950
- I wonder what happened with
my wife's telephone call?

42:01.019 --> 42:02.552
- I assume we misconnected, sir.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.554
We'll try again
when you arrive in kingston.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.221
- Oh, well, she retires
at 9:00 pm.

42:06.258 --> 42:07.957
And that's less than four hours.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.894
My back thanks you,
prime minister.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.763
I will consider your proposals.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.798
- I'll await your reply.
- Hm.

42:17.135 --> 42:18.902
- Oh, mr. Weston.
Please stay behind.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.236
- I don't have time.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.438
- I'm afraid you'll have to let
them leave without you.

42:22.474 --> 42:23.239
(car door closing)

42:23.374 --> 42:24.641
- What are you doing, murdoch?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.443
- He was working with clegg.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.845
I heard the other side
of that phone call.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.081
It was your voice, wasn't it?

42:38.723 --> 42:40.890
- Dr. Ogden! Detective.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.325
- Miss hart,
forgive the intrusion.

42:42.327 --> 42:45.127
When I heard the news,
I wanted to see for myself.

42:46.431 --> 42:49.198
- We've had something of a
history with agent clegg here.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.866
- He injected me with rabies.

42:51.803 --> 42:54.003
- Well, he's certainly
history now.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.476
It appears the y-section has
already been done.

43:00.478 --> 43:02.812
- Mm. It just looks that way.

43:02.814 --> 43:04.680
Now we get to do it for real.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.751
(suspenseful music)

43:12.157 --> 43:13.889
