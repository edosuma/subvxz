WEBVTT

02:13:27.872 --> 02:13:28.862
<i>Dan: You can catch
all that action</i>

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:31.910
<i>on "CSC On Campus With Stan Myers"
coming up at the top of the hour.</i>

02:13:31.976 --> 02:13:34.377
<i>And you won't want to miss
championship billiards at 1:00 A.M.</i>

02:13:34.445 --> 02:13:36.436
Yoshira Yatsimura
takes on Greta Lipsik

02:13:36.514 --> 02:13:37.709
for the 9-ball crown,

02:13:37.782 --> 02:13:40.183
and when those two get together,
it's a barn burner.

02:13:40.251 --> 02:13:41.548
<i>Casey: That's all for us.</i>

02:13:41.619 --> 02:13:43.587
<i>I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.</i>

02:13:43.654 --> 02:13:46.316
And if you've had half as much fun
watching the show as we've had doing it,

02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:48.484
well, then we've had twice
as much fun doing the show

02:13:48.559 --> 02:13:50.527
as you've had watching it.
That's "Sports Night."

02:13:50.595 --> 02:13:51.892
-- See you tomorrow.
-- Good night.

02:13:51.963 --> 02:13:53.488
-- Music.
-- Go.

02:13:53.564 --> 02:13:55.692
[Up-tempo music plays]
-- Roll credits. -- Go.

02:13:55.766 --> 02:13:56.961
We're out.

02:13:57.034 --> 02:13:59.526
Nice show, everybody.

02:13:59.604 --> 02:14:01.834
-- What are you doing tonight?
-- Going to sleep.

02:14:01.906 --> 02:14:03.305
-- Come outwith me.
-- Where?

02:14:03.374 --> 02:14:04.899
<i>El Perro Fumando.</i>

02:14:04.976 --> 02:14:06.307
-- The Smoking Dog.
-- Yes.

02:14:06.377 --> 02:14:07.139
Why?

02:14:07.211 --> 02:14:10.670
If you wear something blue, you get two
dollars off a giant blue margarita.

02:14:10.748 --> 02:14:12.273
You know, I make
a pretty good living.

02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:14.648
I can actually afford to wear
what I want and pay full price.

02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:17.245
<i>I'm not promoting the economic
upside as much as I am</i>

02:14:17.321 --> 02:14:19.756
the opportunity to drink
something giant and blue.

02:14:19.824 --> 02:14:21.053
I'm going to bed.

02:14:23.828 --> 02:14:25.489
-- Dana's coming.
-- Dana's coming?

02:14:25.563 --> 02:14:27.531
And you know what
that can lead to.

02:14:27.598 --> 02:14:28.793
"Boogie Shoes."

02:14:28.866 --> 02:14:31.301
<i>F My, my, my, my,
my boogie shoes... F</i>

02:14:31.369 --> 02:14:34.134
I'm in. Hey, Jeremy, we're going to
this place called E! Perro Fumando,

02:14:34.205 --> 02:14:36.640
where, if, what, you wear a thing,
then something else happens

02:14:36.707 --> 02:14:38.766
-- for $2 less than it would've before.
-- Come with us.

02:14:38.843 --> 02:14:41.335
Here's the thing -- if Dana gets,
like, half a margarita in her,

02:14:41.412 --> 02:14:43.608
there's a better than even
chance she'll get up on a table

02:14:43.681 --> 02:14:45.206
and start dancing
to "My Boogie Shoes."

02:14:45.283 --> 02:14:46.717
I did it one time.

02:14:46.784 --> 02:14:48.218
<i>El Perro Fumando?</i>

02:14:48.286 --> 02:14:49.515
The Flaming Dog.

02:14:49.587 --> 02:14:50.520
Smoking Dog.

02:14:50.588 --> 02:14:51.646
Not The Flaming Dog?

02:14:51.722 --> 02:14:52.848
The dog's not gay.

02:14:52.924 --> 02:14:54.688
<i>I wasn't suggesting
the dog was gay.</i>

02:14:54.759 --> 02:14:56.625
I was suggesting
the dog was on fire.

02:14:56.694 --> 02:14:58.753
He's not smoking on fire.
He's smoking a cigarette.

02:14:58.829 --> 02:15:00.627
-- He's smoking a pipe.
-- He's smoking a cigar.

02:15:00.698 --> 02:15:01.631
I say he's 99V-

02:15:01.699 --> 02:15:02.757
Come on outwith us.

02:15:02.833 --> 02:15:03.925
No, I'll catch up later.

02:15:04.001 --> 02:15:05.264
Work's over, Jeremy.

02:15:05.336 --> 02:15:08.237
It's time for big, giant
blue things at $2 off.

02:15:08.306 --> 02:15:11.571
I just wanted to write a quick letter to my
sister, Louise. She's a sophomore at Amherst.

02:15:11.642 --> 02:15:13.132
-- You write letters?
-- I write to Louise.

02:15:13.210 --> 02:15:15.406
That's nice. I haven't
written a letter in years.

02:15:15.479 --> 02:15:16.878
I do everything
by phone now.

02:15:16.948 --> 02:15:18.109
My sister can't hear.

02:15:19.150 --> 02:15:21.812
Ah...well, catch up
with us when you're done.

02:15:21.886 --> 02:15:23.980
And wear something blue.

02:15:24.055 --> 02:15:26.251
You want me to stick
around for company?

02:15:26.324 --> 02:15:28.053
-- Me?
-- Yeah. I can stick around.

02:15:29.293 --> 02:15:33.924
No, no, I've got everything
-- word processor, envelope.

02:15:33.998 --> 02:15:36.296
-- Okay...stamps?
-- Okay.

02:15:36.367 --> 02:15:39.598
Oh, I actually don't have a stamp
to speak of, but that's okay.

02:15:39.670 --> 02:15:41.138
<i>I've found that when
I need a stamp,</i>

02:15:41.205 --> 02:15:42.331
one materializes.

02:15:42.406 --> 02:15:44.067
I never know where
one's gonna come from,

02:15:44.141 --> 02:15:46.132
but they always do --
stamps.

02:15:46.210 --> 02:15:49.578
I haven't found that. I've found that when
I need a stamp, there's never one around.

02:15:49.647 --> 02:15:51.376
This was back when I
used to write letters.

02:15:51.449 --> 02:15:53.645
When I used to write letters,
I could never find a stamp.

02:15:53.718 --> 02:15:55.345
Hey. Can you guess
what I'm thinking now?

02:15:55.419 --> 02:15:57.717
That no one gives a damn about
me and my history with stamps?

02:15:57.788 --> 02:15:58.778
-- Bull's-eye.
-- Mmm.

02:15:59.657 --> 02:16:01.421
You'll come by later,
though, right?

02:16:01.492 --> 02:16:02.618
Sure.

02:16:02.693 --> 02:16:04.593
How do we know
the dog is a he?

02:16:04.662 --> 02:16:06.494
"E! Perro" is masculine.

02:16:06.564 --> 02:16:11.092
Sounds like Dana's translation
has him leaning another way.

02:16:11.168 --> 02:16:12.693
<i>Jeremy: [Thinking]
Dear Louise...</i>

02:16:16.374 --> 02:16:18.866
<i>Dear Louise, it's a little
after midnight on Thursday,</i>

02:16:18.943 --> 02:16:20.274
<i>and I'm sitting in the middle</i>

02:16:20.344 --> 02:16:22.244
<i>of the main newsroom
at "Sports Night."</i>

02:16:22.313 --> 02:16:24.975
<i>I can't even begin to describe
how much I love this place.</i>

02:16:25.049 --> 02:16:26.710
<i>I've only been here
three months,</i>

02:16:26.784 --> 02:16:28.513
<i>but it feels a lot
like home to me.</i>

02:16:28.586 --> 02:16:29.747
<i>Some of the guys asked me</i>

02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:31.879
<i>to go outwith them
after the show tonight.</i>

02:16:31.956 --> 02:16:33.856
<i>That's never happened before.</i>

02:16:33.924 --> 02:16:35.221
<i>I'd kinda like to join them,</i>

02:16:35.291 --> 02:16:37.090
<i>so I'm gonna make this
a short one.</i>

02:16:37.161 --> 02:16:40.028
<i>In your last letter, you asked
me what Dan and Casey are like.</i>

02:16:40.097 --> 02:16:42.531
<i>And I can't wait to tell you
all about them in person,</i>

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:43.897
<i>but, for now, I'll just say</i>

02:16:43.968 --> 02:16:45.868
<i>that as impressive
as they are on the air,</i>

02:16:45.936 --> 02:16:47.630
<i>the thing that
constantly amazes me</i>

02:16:47.705 --> 02:16:49.833
<i>is that the pressure
of writing and performing</i>

02:16:49.906 --> 02:16:52.842
a <i>live show every night
never gets to them.</i>

02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:54.468
-- What's going on?
-- Where have you been?

02:16:54.545 --> 02:16:56.808
Well, I was in Editing.
Kim said there was an emergency.

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.179
-- <i>It is</i> an <i>emergency.</i>
-- <i>Is it your mom?</i>

02:16:59.250 --> 02:17:00.342
-- What's wrong with my mom?
-- I'm asking.

02:17:00.418 --> 02:17:01.907
-- It's not my mom.
-- Well, what is it?

02:17:01.986 --> 02:17:03.476
-- Why did you say it was my mom?
-- I didn't say it was your mom.

02:17:03.554 --> 02:17:05.545
Yeah, but you jumped to that
right away, which makes me think

02:17:05.623 --> 02:17:08.148
there's something wrong with my mom, Casey.
What's wrong with my mom, man?

02:17:08.225 --> 02:17:11.525
Danny, Danny, I'm on deadline here.
ls there an emergency or not?

02:17:11.594 --> 02:17:12.687
Yeah.

02:17:12.763 --> 02:17:14.059
Well, what?

02:17:14.130 --> 02:17:16.190
It's pretty serious.

02:17:16.267 --> 02:17:17.200
What?

02:17:17.268 --> 02:17:18.758
I have writer's block.

02:17:18.835 --> 02:17:20.361
You have writer's block?

02:17:20.438 --> 02:17:22.099
I have writer's block.

02:17:22.173 --> 02:17:23.937
-- Emergency writer's block?
-- I'm telling you.

02:17:24.008 --> 02:17:25.498
[Sighs deeply]

02:17:25.575 --> 02:17:27.374
All right, how long?

02:17:27.445 --> 02:17:30.346
A while now --
about 20 minutes.

02:17:30.414 --> 02:17:32.382
Just cool down.
You're gripping, that's all.

02:17:32.450 --> 02:17:33.383
Talk me through this.

02:17:33.450 --> 02:17:34.748
Well,
are you totally lost?

02:17:34.818 --> 02:17:36.183
I'm totally lost, man.

02:17:36.253 --> 02:17:38.312
I'm in the tall grass.
I'm in the weeds!

02:17:38.388 --> 02:17:40.448
All right, all right,
listen to me.

02:17:40.523 --> 02:17:42.618
We're the best, okay?
The very best.

02:17:42.692 --> 02:17:45.287
-- Yeah? -- VVell, maybe not the
best, but we're pretty good.

02:17:45.361 --> 02:17:47.693
-- Right. -- I put us easily
into the top 30 or 40.

02:17:47.764 --> 02:17:49.290
Okay, this isn't helping me.

02:17:49.366 --> 02:17:51.664
-- Hey, look at me. We've won awards.
-- Ah, you've won awards.

02:17:51.736 --> 02:17:53.362
-- You've won awards.
-- I haven't won awards.

02:17:53.471 --> 02:17:54.495
You've been nominated
for awards.

02:17:54.572 --> 02:17:55.698
-- It's not the same.
-- Sure <i>it</i> is.

02:17:55.772 --> 02:17:58.868
That's easy for you to say --
you've won awards.

02:17:58.942 --> 02:18:01.378
Hey, look, we write the news. It's not
like we're hurting for story ideas.

02:18:01.445 --> 02:18:03.709
-- What's the problem?
-- I can't write.

02:18:03.781 --> 02:18:05.010
I mean <i>exactly</i>
what's the problem.

02:18:05.082 --> 02:18:06.014
-- <i>Exactly?</i>
-- <i>Yeah.</i>

02:18:06.083 --> 02:18:07.812
I can't write!

02:18:07.885 --> 02:18:10.353
-- What are you working on?
Red Wings/Ftyers.

02:18:10.421 --> 02:18:12.388
All right. Let me see.

02:18:12.456 --> 02:18:15.687
[Chair wheels rattling]

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:20.254
"The Flyers played the Red Wings
in a hockey game last night,

02:18:20.331 --> 02:18:22.424
and they won four to three."

02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:23.558
You see?

02:18:23.634 --> 02:18:26.193
This is more serious
than I thought.

02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:27.862
Morning, gentlemen.

02:18:27.938 --> 02:18:29.906
-- Hey, Isaac.
-- Morning.

02:18:29.974 --> 02:18:32.909
<i>Jeremy: Isaac Jaffee is the
managing editor of "Sports Night."</i>

02:18:32.977 --> 02:18:34.808
<i>He's led a pretty
remarkable life.</i>

02:18:34.879 --> 02:18:37.143
<i>He started out as a stringer
for the Atlanta Journal,</i>

02:18:37.214 --> 02:18:40.206
<i>won a Pulitzer Prize for his
coverage of the Gemini missions,</i>

02:18:40.284 --> 02:18:42.718
<i>and retired as London
bureau chief for CNN.</i>

02:18:42.787 --> 02:18:45.017
<i>But his passion
has always been sports.</i>

02:18:45.089 --> 02:18:47.990
<i>Three years ago, when Luther
Sachs bought Continental Corp.</i>

02:18:48.058 --> 02:18:50.754
<i>and announced that he was
starting a cable-sports division,</i>

02:18:50.827 --> 02:18:52.557
<i>Isaac came out of retirement.</i>

02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:53.755
-- Isaac.
-- Dana.

02:18:53.831 --> 02:18:55.492
How are you this morning?

02:18:55.566 --> 02:19:00.333
My 16-year-old daughter is dating a
Republican in her class named Chad.

02:19:00.437 --> 02:19:02.235
Chad's a 16-year-old
Republican?

02:19:02.306 --> 02:19:05.276
-- That's right. -- I didn't know
16-year-olds had party affiliations.

02:19:05.342 --> 02:19:07.242
Chad was just
elected president

02:19:07.311 --> 02:19:10.110
of the Connecticut Young
Black Republican caucus.

02:19:10.181 --> 02:19:11.648
He has a 3.9 GPA,

02:19:11.715 --> 02:19:14.912
he is co-captain of
the lacrosse team,

02:19:14.985 --> 02:19:17.010
he plays the French horn,

02:19:17.087 --> 02:19:20.717
and does volunteer work
at a crisis hotline.

02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:22.259
Sounds wonderful.

02:19:22.325 --> 02:19:26.490
Dana, did you hear me?
He's a Republican!

02:19:26.564 --> 02:19:29.261
A lot of folks are running in
that direction these days, Isaac.

02:19:29.333 --> 02:19:32.303
Yeah? Well, I don't want 'em
sniffing around my women.

02:19:32.369 --> 02:19:33.837
What are you gonna do?

02:19:33.904 --> 02:19:35.633
What any reasonable man
would do --

02:19:35.706 --> 02:19:38.573
I'm calling a building contractor
and installing a dungeon.

02:19:38.642 --> 02:19:39.700
[Laughs]

02:19:39.777 --> 02:19:42.109
-- Excuse me, Isaac.
-- Good morning, Natalie.

02:19:42.179 --> 02:19:44.442
Have you ever heard of someone
named Archibald Russell?

02:19:44.514 --> 02:19:46.209
-- Archibald Russell?
-- Yeah.

02:19:46.282 --> 02:19:47.580
Doesn't ring a bell.

02:19:47.651 --> 02:19:49.176
-- Okay.
-- Why?

02:19:49.253 --> 02:19:51.483
Uh, Kelly Kirkpatrick just
called in from Kansas City.

02:19:51.555 --> 02:19:55.014
<i>She was scanning, and she picked up a police
report on a guy named Archibald Russell</i>

02:19:55.092 --> 02:19:57.322
who was carjacked this morning
and beaten up pretty bad.

02:19:57.394 --> 02:20:00.125
She thought the name sounded familiar,
and she asked me to ask you.

02:20:00.197 --> 02:20:01.323
No.

02:20:01.398 --> 02:20:03.867
-- Rundown's in five minutes.
-- Okay.

02:20:07.004 --> 02:20:08.335
What was I saying?

<i>I can't stop thinking about the
noon rundown a few weeks ago</i>

02:20:30.527 --> 02:20:33.758
<i>and a guy you've never heard of

02:20:33.831 --> 02:20:35.560
[Talking continues]

02:20:35.633 --> 02:20:39.194
Oh, by the way, Isaac? I got the 4-1-1
on that man, Archibald Russell.

02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:41.568
He was a pitcher with the
old Kansas City Monarchs.

02:20:41.639 --> 02:20:42.697
Archibald Russell?

02:20:42.773 --> 02:20:43.467
Yep.

02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:45.838
-- Oh, good Lord.
-- <i>What?</i>

02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:48.902
Archibald Russell was A.K.
I knew him as A.K.

02:20:48.979 --> 02:20:50.174
He was beaten up?

02:20:50.247 --> 02:20:51.715
A.K. Russell?

02:20:51.782 --> 02:20:54.308
He was carjacked this morning.
They dragged him from his car.

02:20:54.385 --> 02:20:56.581
-- He's in surgery right now.
-- You know him?

02:20:56.654 --> 02:20:59.851
Sure, I know him. Sweetest man in
the world. Terrific ballplayer.

02:20:59.924 --> 02:21:01.449
Nobody noticed him

02:21:01.525 --> 02:21:04.893
because he played on the same
team as Gibson and Jackie.

02:21:04.962 --> 02:21:08.557
<i>Aw, hell, I gotta find
his kids and call them.</i>

02:21:08.632 --> 02:21:09.827
We'll find them for you.

Dana, do the story, would you?
Somewhere up front.

02:21:11.835 --> 02:21:13.860
Yeah. Jeremy,
put together something

02:21:13.938 --> 02:21:16.873
<i>on an old Negro League pitcher
named Archibald Russell.</i>

02:21:16.941 --> 02:21:18.568
He's in Mercy Hospital
in Kansas City.

02:21:18.642 --> 02:21:21.009
Yeah, it's no problem. But I don't know
if we can fit it anywhere up front.

02:21:21.078 --> 02:21:22.603
-- Sure we can.
-- No, we've got <i>4</i> top-25 games,

02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:24.614

some word on Tyson,

02:21:24.682 --> 02:21:27.242
and we're gonna want to put the
Lakers/Knicks in the first 10.

02:21:27.318 --> 02:21:30.253
-- We'll <i>do it anyway.</i> -- <i>l/VeH, I'm

for a story with, at best, local
interest in Kansas City mayb--?

02:21:33.357 --> 02:21:35.382
We'll put it up front, Isaac,
right before the first break.

02:21:35.459 --> 02:21:38.622
-- Thank <i>you.</i>
-- <i>Back here at 2:00.</i>

02:21:38.696 --> 02:21:40.721
<i>Jeremy: I felt terrible for
suggesting that the story</i>

02:21:40.798 --> 02:21:42.892
<i>lacked the importance to be
placed in an early segment.</i>

02:21:42.967 --> 02:21:44.628
<i>But as terrible as I felt then,</i>

02:21:44.702 --> 02:21:47.933

I was gonna feel that night.</i>

Archibald "A.K." Russell

02:21:57.247 --> 02:21:58.806
is probably not a name
you're familiar with,

02:21:58.882 --> 02:22:01.442

watch the Kansas City Monarchs

he's an associate pastor at
the Berry Hill Baptist Church,

02:22:08.359 --> 02:22:11.329
and, oh yeah, taught himself
how to read and write.

02:22:11.395 --> 02:22:13.159

a red light this morning.

02:22:18.035 --> 02:22:20.800
He was dragged from his car,
beaten with sticks and bottles,

02:22:20.871 --> 02:22:22.566
and left at the side
of the road.

Mercy Hospital in Kansas City,

02:22:25.609 --> 02:22:28.408

it wouldn't be because
he's a lawyer.
