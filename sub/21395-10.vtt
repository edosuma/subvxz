08:21.100 --> 08:23.202
- I'll ask you questions
of pertinence, Tony.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.705
Who are you? What's going
on with this storm?

08:25.771 --> 08:28.074
But, mainly--
how are you levitating?

08:28.140 --> 08:30.509
- I think you'll find
most of your questions

08:30.576 --> 08:32.945
lead to the same answer.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.679
- [wind gusting]

08:35.780 --> 08:37.316
- The rainbow gas?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.784
- It's called beam

08:39.852 --> 08:42.087
and its power is for
both good and evil

08:42.154 --> 08:43.722
are limitless.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.125
My people have studied
it for many years,

08:46.192 --> 08:48.895
and we've barely scratched
the surface of its potential.

08:48.961 --> 08:52.465
It's also great for
balloon animals.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.633
- You're good at this.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.834
- Tell your friends.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.802
I do parties, bar mitzvahs,
weddings.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.740
- This stuff, beam, it only
exists in the Wayne, doesn't it?

09:00.806 --> 09:02.642
- Yes, and it makes
this building

09:02.708 --> 09:05.144
a strange and powerful place.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.213
- I have so many
questions to ask you.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.447
- There's no time.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.583
I've come to show you
three things--

09:10.650 --> 09:13.452
the past, the present,
and the future.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.321
- Are you Ebeneezers
greeting me?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.923
- Yes, but not
like the musical.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.191
- I like the musical.
- Unh.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.361
Now, come,
the past awaits.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.697
- [explosion]

09:24.764 --> 09:28.701
- Now the spectrum of events
that have led you here.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.569
- I'm sensing beam scenes.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.373
- Look closely.
What have you learned?

09:34.440 --> 09:36.943
- That the gas
can destroy things.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.878
And bring them
back to life.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.380
It can keep things captive.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.516
- This is how she
keeps me prisoner.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.818
Oh, hello, Saraline.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.321
{\an8}- And make them
more powerful.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.289
{\an8}And in the hands
of a vampire,

09:50.356 --> 09:51.824
{\an8}it can be used
as a weapon.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.361
{\an8}- [screams echoing]

09:55.428 --> 09:58.664
{\an8}- There are those in the Wayne
who are sworn to protect it,

09:58.731 --> 10:00.700
{\an8}and those who wish
to exploit it.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.069
- The spy! But what's
she planning to do?

10:03.135 --> 10:05.571
- That answer lies
in the present,

10:05.638 --> 10:06.939
which is, technically,
the future

10:07.006 --> 10:08.708
because we're currently
in the past.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.643
- So, let's go back
to the future.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.945
- I thought this was
"A Christmas Carol."

10:13.012 --> 10:15.481
- [thunder crashing]
- [electrical zapping]

10:15.548 --> 10:16.949
- So, let me get
this straight.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.684
There's a giant rainbow
lightning bolt

10:18.751 --> 10:19.719
forming as we speak,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.153
and it's about to
strike the Wayne,

10:21.220 --> 10:23.589
and the only way to stop it
is by assembling the conductor?

10:23.656 --> 10:25.091
- Right.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.726
- How are we supposed
to assemble the conductor,

10:26.792 --> 10:28.661
if we don't know
what that is?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.196
- It's a calculated telescope
that withstands

10:30.262 --> 10:31.931
up to 5000 microcoulombs
of trauma charge.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.566
- I wish Saraline were here.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.834
She knows Esperanto.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.302
- It'll help absorb
the rainbow bolt

10:36.369 --> 10:39.338
that's gonna level your
building, if you don't hurry!

10:39.405 --> 10:40.573
- Hurry where?

10:40.639 --> 10:42.675
- To that shortcut.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.811
- [door slams]

10:45.878 --> 10:47.913
- This is a janitor closet.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.850
- A janitor closet/
a static shortcut.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.852
- Uh, yeah, Ansi. Duh!

10:52.918 --> 10:55.421
- All right, if you wanna
find the conductor,

10:55.488 --> 10:57.256
do what we say
when we say it.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.026
You, move the paint can
to the second shelf.

11:00.092 --> 11:04.163
- Dude, useless, move that mop
bucket about 6 centimeters left.

11:04.230 --> 11:08.234
- Did I say five centimeters?
I said six!

11:08.300 --> 11:10.736
- Shhh! Inside voice.

11:10.803 --> 11:14.473
Now turn on
the hot water and...

11:14.540 --> 11:16.642
- [device powers up]

11:16.709 --> 11:18.244
- [whooshing]

11:18.310 --> 11:19.678
- It's a shortcut, baby.

11:19.745 --> 11:20.846
- BOTH:
Whoa!

11:20.913 --> 11:22.648
- So, what's in there?
- Go on, dudes.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.717
- ANSI &amp; OLLY:
[screaming]

11:26.185 --> 11:27.420
- Oh!

11:30.856 --> 11:32.691
- Okay, vampire.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.560
- Do I, uh, know you?

11:34.627 --> 11:37.229
- We're gonna take
a little walk now.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.297
Huh?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.132
[gasps]

11:40.199 --> 11:41.000
[groans]

11:41.067 --> 11:42.935
That was my calligraphy arm.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.671
- Huh, so I guess
I can do that.

11:45.738 --> 11:46.839
- [growling]

11:46.906 --> 11:48.808

11:48.874 --> 11:51.544

not even trying.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.845

11:52.912 --> 11:55.881
{\an8}- Sorry about that whole
beating you up thing.

11:55.948 --> 11:59.485
{\an8}So, uh, I'm gonna go
do roof stuff now.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.654
Why am I telling you that?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.622
- [laser blasting]

12:03.689 --> 12:06.425
- [groans]
That was my calligraphy leg.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.428

12:09.495 --> 12:11.530

[screaming]

12:11.597 --> 12:13.399
- Where are we?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.800
- I know this place.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.669
We're at the bottom
of the Wayne.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.604
- Hurry, this is
part of the vessel's tank.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.306
Let's assemble
the conductor.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.007
- [whooshing]

12:22.074 --> 12:24.310

12:24.376 --> 12:28.247
- Oh, my bedroom.
Right now. Impressive.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.484
- Hold on, there's something
I have to check first.

12:31.550 --> 12:35.054
- Oh, Bobby and Tommy.
You, too?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.722
- If Saraline were here,
she'd have a plan.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.224
- Ansi? Olly?

12:38.290 --> 12:40.126
What are you doing
with Bobby and Tommy?

12:40.192 --> 12:42.027
I told you you couldn't
tell the difference

12:42.094 --> 12:43.562
between fantasy and reality.

12:43.629 --> 12:44.897

12:44.964 --> 12:47.800
You know they're
on TV, right?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.368
- So, how do we
assemble the conductor?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.837
- I think there's a button,
or is it a switch?

12:51.904 --> 12:53.139
- Isn't it a lever?

12:53.205 --> 12:55.107
- No, it's a valve.
It's totally a valve.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.343
Or a button.
Did we say button yet?

12:57.409 --> 12:58.544
- Mm.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.379
- Look at this place.
That could be anything.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.914

it when you see it.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.544

You assembled the conductor.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.895
- You're half-way there.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.797
- Next, we've gotta
fill the vessel.

13:51.864 --> 13:52.831
So, what's it look like?

13:52.898 --> 13:54.033
- Ah, it's sorta meaty.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.701
And something about
the number 78.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.969
I never stop caring.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.837
- If Saraline were here,
she'd tell us to get

13:58.904 --> 14:00.739
back to the roof,
check on the storm,

14:00.806 --> 14:01.974
and come up
with our next plan.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.542

Bobby and Tommy,

14:03.609 --> 14:04.643
let's do this.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.178
- Actually, our work
here is done.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.080
- Yeah, you are on
your own, dudes.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.016
We have to get to whaliens
and sausages and junk.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.586

Good luck!

14:13.652 --> 14:15.054
- Yeah, and remember,

14:15.120 --> 14:17.056
if the Wayne gets struck
by a massive rainbow bolt,

14:17.122 --> 14:18.524
that's on you, pal.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.792
Later.
- Bye, guys.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.728

great episode.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.530
- [thunder rumbling]

14:24.597 --> 14:27.266

this thing somehow.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.234
What is it?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.168
- It's like a lightning rod.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.136
Another beam strike
is coming,

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
and it could destroy
the building.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.273
- But this can
stop it, right?

14:34.340 --> 14:36.875
- Only partly.
There's another step.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.178
But your team
needs your help.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.780

do is watch cartoons.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.049

it came in handy.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.218

There's a giant rainbow bolt
about to destroy the Wayne.

- And you assembled this
conductor to divert the blast.

attracts the lightning

17:25.444 --> 17:27.079
and it feeds the energy
into the vessel,

17:27.146 --> 17:28.414

powerful enough
