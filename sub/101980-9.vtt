02:02.331 --> 02:03.540
Good morning, George.

02:27.064 --> 02:27.981
Where's George?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.067
He left.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.238
He did? When?

02:35.989 --> 02:36.990
Last night.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.829
He must have gone for Jericho.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.920
He'll be back in time for lunch, I'm sure.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.226
Did you say your father
is bringing someone?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.854
What?

03:06.937 --> 03:09.398
To lunch. I thought you said
your dad was bringing a date.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.902
Yes. Kourtney, with a "K."

03:17.990 --> 03:19.283
We don't have to do this.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.576
Yes, we do.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.328
Jericho needs his family today.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.914
It's his first Christmas.

03:29.459 --> 03:34.339
So that's me, you, Julian, Frank,
Kourtney with a "K," and Leanne?

03:35.591 --> 03:38.927
Yes, of course, Leanne. We should
also set a place for George as well.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.888
Okay, so that's seven.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.181
Then I better do his brother.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.265
Good.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.060
We'll show them
a perfect Turner Christmas.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.295
They can't just take him back.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.506
Apparently Sean sees it differently.

04:57.589 --> 05:01.009
And given Dorothy's
somewhat tender mental state,

05:01.718 --> 05:04.179
asking too many questions
will be inadvisable.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.641
It's taken Herculean efforts
just to stop her from involving the cops.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.520
This is why we have contracts.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.730
What have I always taught you?

05:13.814 --> 05:17.067
Oral agreements are only as good
as the paper they're written on.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.946
I don't understand.
They have a baby or don't they?

05:22.781 --> 05:27.661
Not that it's any of your business,
Kourtney, but they did, once upon a time.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.540
Wait, but whose baby
are they waiting for tonight?

05:31.623 --> 05:32.791
Jesus, keep up!

05:32.875 --> 05:35.085
They had a baby,
then they had a fake baby,

05:35.169 --> 05:38.046
then it was replaced with a real baby
and now it's a fake baby again.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.923
But this time, Dorothy knows,

05:40.007 --> 05:43.385
and she's expecting the Wisconsin yeti
to arrive with a real baby any minute.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.887
You follow, Kourtney?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.096
No.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.015
Just try not to blow your top, Kourtney.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.808
We're hanging on by a thread.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.436
Merry fucking Christmas, one and all.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.773
All right. Nice and easy.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.276
Let the show begin.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.777
Careful, Julian.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.616
Hello. Come in out of the cold.
Is it snowing?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.829
-Hello.
-You're too thin, sweetheart.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.587
And this, right here, is Kourtney.
Kourtney, Dorothy.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.342
Dorothy Turner, 8 News.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.387
I'm a big fan.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.558
Aren't you sweet?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.819
Your guests have arrived.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.073
The best thing about being the cook is...

06:48.492 --> 06:49.826
no one cares if you hide.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.582
She thinks he's coming back today, Sean.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.046
Your uncle made it seem like
there was a chance.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.093
My uncle left.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.054
He's not coming back.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.932
You don't know that.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.560
Look at my hand, he healed it.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.186
He wants to help us.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.023
My uncle isn't like me.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.735
-He's not gonna break the rules.
-Why not?

07:24.528 --> 07:28.198
What are the rules? Explain them to me.
I want to understand.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.326
Please.

07:31.410 --> 07:34.496
Leanne, I feel like...
we're running out of time.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.876
What will Dorothy do
if he doesn't come back today?

07:54.308 --> 07:58.145
Yeah, so the Pinot Gris,
followed by the Malbec,

07:58.228 --> 08:01.064
followed by the sweet, sweet Riesling.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.525
Malbec with goose?

08:06.320 --> 08:09.698
She said she'd follow him if there
was a chance there's something else.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.117
Dorothy wouldn't be so stupid.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
I don't know anymore. I can't predict her.

08:17.122 --> 08:20.250
We gotta be prepared in case
things don't go as we expect today.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.627
"As we expect"?

08:21.710 --> 08:24.838
You don't seriously believe that man
is gonna bring your son back today.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.841
There's evidence. The note. Roscoe.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.219
What he said to Dorothy yesterday.
It's possible.

08:30.302 --> 08:34.014
Jesus, Sean. I'm starting to feel like
the only sane fucking one in this family.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.067
If no one else is going to...

08:54.326 --> 08:56.078
The banquet is complete.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.550
-I would just like to say--
-Nothing.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.677
-Okay.
-Remember how we agreed you'd say nothing?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.137
Well, I'd like to say something.

09:27.484 --> 09:33.240
I would like to thank God that
we are all here today with each other.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.325
To be together.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.955
This beautiful home with more food
than we can feasibly consume.

09:40.038 --> 09:44.918
These... La Bonnotte potatoes
are flown in at $300 a pound.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.420
We are very fortunate.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.964
And we all know it.

09:50.174 --> 09:54.636
And perhaps we don't deserve to ask for
anything more, but something is missing.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.058
So please, take it all away.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.811
We don't deserve it. We don't need it.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.106
Just bring us back what we lost.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.401
Amen.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.279
Thank you, darling. That was beautiful.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
Yeah.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.075
Shall we eat?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.040
$300 for potatoes.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.584
I'm sorry. What the fuck was that?

10:28.837 --> 10:32.174
-Julian.
-I'll repeat. What the fuck was that?

10:32.257 --> 10:36.678
It was just a prayer.
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.639
I'm not blowing anything
out of proportion.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.725
I just didn't realize we invited
the goddamn reverend to dinner.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.228
Don't be so tense.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.106
What's the harm in a little faith?

10:48.190 --> 10:50.859
Belief can do wonders
in the realm of pain.

10:50.943 --> 10:54.488
Pain? You never gave a fuck about my pain.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.035
-Sorry, Dottie.
-It's fine.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.455
Let's just all eat, please.

11:08.460 --> 11:14.341
Sean, this goose is delicious.
It really... melts in your mouth.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.093
Yes.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.136
Sean is a master.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.805
Thank you, Kourtney.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.937
Leanne, can I serve you some goose?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.773
Yes, please. I'd like to try some.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.775
Wonderful.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.867
Did you hear that? That might be them.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.910
Just get ready.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.417
-Your phone is ringing.
-I'm aware. Thank you.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.052
All right, let's get you inside there.

12:02.806 --> 12:06.602
So, Leanne,
Frank tells me you're from Wisconsin.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.772
Yes. Julian, could you
please pass me the potatoes?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.274
Will you all please excuse me?

12:41.512 --> 12:44.515
May we be thankful
for what I'm about to receive.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.086
Are you okay?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.090
Yeah.

13:19.550 --> 13:20.676
Are you?

13:23.262 --> 13:26.515
I'm not really sure
how I'm supposed to act.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.103
-How do people act after--
-They don't.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.068
Why won't you answer her calls?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.194
Not tonight.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.073
Juju, you're gonna miss your turn.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.912
What we did was a mistake.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.623
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.792
I'm not.

13:56.253 --> 13:59.965
I feel different now, Julian.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.177
More powerful. It feels good.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.764
I think it feels good for you too,
doesn't it?

14:09.308 --> 14:13.812
This isn't right.
I'm not right in the head.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.691
Then just let me take your pain away.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.652
Like I did last night.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.322
What are you doing, Leanne?

14:24.198 --> 14:25.282
What I want.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.034
Juju?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.036
I should go.

14:38.837 --> 14:42.674
Talking about playing games.
So I decided to slip out.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.518
-Lunch was nice.
-Thank you.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.275
It's just after 3:00.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.863
What are you thinking?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.576
That maybe I was wrong.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.543
I will give them till sunset.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.420
Yeah.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.857
Film.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.358
Three words.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.700
-Fish?
-Jaws: The Return. Next.

15:50.409 --> 15:51.743
Do we really have to play this?

15:51.827 --> 15:54.454
If we want Dorothy to think
we're having fun, then yes.

16:01.837 --> 16:02.838
Okay, so it's a book.

16:02.921 --> 16:06.341
Disqualified for not understanding
the simplest fucking rule. Next.

16:06.425 --> 16:08.177
Julian! Play nice!

16:12.556 --> 16:15.934
-Book. Well done, darling.
-Oh, my God.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.147
Could they be testing us?

16:20.981 --> 16:22.357
Watching us?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.110
It's 3:30.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.362
Don't think about that.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.200
What else am I supposed to think about?

16:32.910 --> 16:35.787
Think about Jericho back in your arms,
and what you'll do.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.792
First, I'll smell his little head.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.297
Just breathe him in.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.717
Then I'll sing to him.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.847
I always wanted to be the kind of mother
who sang lullabies, you know?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.101
What will you do?

16:59.102 --> 17:00.479
I don't know.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.773
Whatever it is,
I'll let him know that I love him.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.531
It's 3:31.

17:12.907 --> 17:16.662
Food. Consumption.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.247
Sick. Vomit!

17:18.329 --> 17:20.624
You always were a competitive child.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.709
Starving.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.252
Hungry?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.172
Hungry. Something, something,
hungry, something.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.718
And I probably
rewarded you for it too much.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.720
Still, I'll say, at the time,

17:33.804 --> 17:39.017
I distinctly remember that was
how you were supposed to raise a man.

17:39.101 --> 17:42.020
The first word. The. Second word.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.023
Big.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.067
Balloon.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.112
Oh, God, stop miming that one and move on!

17:50.195 --> 17:51.363
What's the last word?

17:56.702 --> 17:58.161
You okay down there, darling?

18:00.956 --> 18:03.333
Rowing. Convulsing.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.627
Dying! Dead.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.129
How many fucking syllables?

18:07.212 --> 18:09.131
The Very Hungry Caterpillar.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.341
Yes.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.510
Well done, dear.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.138
Both of you.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.806
I was just about to say that.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.099
Really? Were you?

18:19.558 --> 18:20.809
Well played, Dottie.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.145
Excuse me whilst I tinkle.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.482
-Anything?
-The roads are bad.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.026
They're probably caught in traffic.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.819
I'll check the news for accidents.

18:31.445 --> 18:35.449
But keep playing, please.
It's so nice to see people happy.

18:38.035 --> 18:42.164
Sean, things seem to be
getting fraught. Maybe we should go.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.584
No, no, no. Please, stay.
She could do with your support.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.214
Don't box me out, Julian.

18:52.257 --> 18:56.094
I know how you're feeling right now,
and I know you refuse to acknowledge it.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.681
Where have Dorothy and Leanne gone?
Wouldn't they like to play?

19:01.266 --> 19:02.267
No.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.236
Listen to me. I want to help you.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.489
Let me try to speak with you.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.698
Julian.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.952
We're starting without you.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.871
You're gonna miss this round.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.793
Are you there?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.548
Let me try to speak with you.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.392
You don't have to go
through this shit alone.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.644
I don't know why
you keep insisting that you do.

19:46.812 --> 19:47.980
Call me back.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.776
What was that?

19:52.860 --> 19:54.069
Julian?

19:55.571 --> 19:59.324
A snowstorm is creating
dangerous driving conditions

19:59.408 --> 20:01.368
all around Philadelphia.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.205
Holiday travelers should expect delays.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.076
What was that?

20:43.660 --> 20:44.828
Kourtney?

20:44.912 --> 20:45.996
What's going on?

20:46.830 --> 20:47.831
What?

20:49.541 --> 20:50.542
What's happened?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.045
-He's not breathing. Do something!
-What?

20:53.128 --> 20:55.005
CPR! Something!

21:02.304 --> 21:03.722
What happened?

21:03.805 --> 21:05.098
Dorothy, don't look.

21:05.724 --> 21:06.767
Call an ambulance.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.561

Talk to us. How are you, boy?

22:29.641 --> 22:30.809
I saw him there.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.937
He seemed okay.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.441
What? Who you talking about?
Who'd you see?

Just some ibuprofen.

And this.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.413
We'll drive his car and meet you there.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.253
Say good night to Dorothy for us.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.841
And thank you for lunch.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.634
Dorothy?

24:34.683 --> 24:37.477
It was so strange to see him that way.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.275
I saw what you made in the basement.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.743
Sean mustn't know about that.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.080
What's it for?

25:00.083 --> 25:01.627
Contingency.

25:03.921 --> 25:06.507
In case Jericho doesn't come back.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.929
You'd die to be with him?

25:15.557 --> 25:17.351
Of course, Leanne.

25:20.437 --> 25:21.688
I'm his mother.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.137
Dorothy?

26:02.271 --> 26:03.272
Dorothy?

26:06.650 --> 26:07.943
Dorothy!

26:22.958 --> 26:24.126
Mr. Turner.

26:25.669 --> 26:28.338
I understand you're looking for Jericho.
