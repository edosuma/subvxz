You okay, Andre?

00:02.377 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Empire...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.671
I would never
threaten a woman.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.214
You wouldn't. I did.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.508
Those blackouts you're having,
I can do that whenever I want.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.634

00:09.718 --> 00:11.177
This is
my little brother Julian.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.345
I told you
he was coming to visit.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.805
How 'bout some diplomacy?

00:13.888 --> 00:15.098
You stay away from my family

00:15.181 --> 00:16.725
and yours will keep breathing.

00:16.808 --> 00:17.809
That's a deal.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.769
You were born for that stage

00:19.853 --> 00:21.813
and that gift
that makes you beautiful.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.356
We need a Bossy sound.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.734
That says,
"You are listening to Bossy."

00:25.817 --> 00:27.736
Durrell.
I will never get over

00:27.819 --> 00:30.363

away from me.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.491
Hey, Teri.
It smells good in here.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.118
Did you prepare
this meal yourself?

00:35.201 --> 00:36.703
Yes, I did.
I love our new kitchen.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.413
What meal, child?

00:38.496 --> 00:39.581
I'm just saying, honey.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.000
Cookie starts talking
in third person

00:42.083 --> 00:43.126
when she ain't had
nothing to eat

00:43.209 --> 00:44.419
and all you keep
filling her up with

00:44.502 --> 00:45.962
is cheese and crackers.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.714
Dinner will be out shortly.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.508
We had a little issue
with the frenching

00:50.592 --> 00:52.927
the rack of lamb,
but it has all been resolved.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.763
"Frenching"?
What, you in there trying to be

00:54.846 --> 00:55.972
fancy or something?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.140
I mean, listen, girl, please.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.600
That mattered, like,
two hours ago.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.727
We just need you to throw
that food on a plate

01:00.810 --> 01:02.020
and bring it out.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.313
- Is it cooked? Just bring it.
- Amen.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.106
Trust me, it'll be worth it.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.400
Teri, you sure
you don't need some help?

01:07.484 --> 01:08.693

01:08.777 --> 01:10.195

I think it's time we propose

01:12.614 --> 01:14.699
a new Lyon family dinner
tradition.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.284
And what's that?

01:16.367 --> 01:19.120
Teri and I have decided
no business talk

01:19.204 --> 01:20.705
and no what, babe?

01:20.789 --> 01:21.873
Drama.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.875
Our home is all peace, love,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.418

01:25.502 --> 01:28.880

some food?

-I'll be right back.

Don't french it.

my favorite artist.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.976
So how did the gig go?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.813
It was amazing.
The crowd ate it up.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.523
I'm hyped right now.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.191

01:48.274 --> 01:50.568

02:03.081 --> 02:05.208
Those two things
don't go together, nephew.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.210
- I'll call you back.
- Bye.
