00:00.768 --> 00:03.067
Previously on warehouse 13...

00:03.134 --> 00:04.933
Can we get back
to the warehouse computers

00:05.000 --> 00:06.167
Being breached?

00:06.234 --> 00:07.734
Somebody is poking around
in your system.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.334
I should never have
told you.

00:09.401 --> 00:11.334
Warehouse 13.

00:11.401 --> 00:12.434
I got hacked.

00:12.501 --> 00:14.234
Does Artie seem a little,

00:14.301 --> 00:17.534
I don't know,
crankier than usual?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.501
Who's there?

00:19.567 --> 00:22.768
Someone's there.
I can hear--

00:22.833 --> 00:24.000
What the hell was that?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.933
Artie,
what are you gonna do?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:41.434 --> 00:43.267
I know this place.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.867
I know this place.

00:52.933 --> 00:55.167
Yes.
you've been here before.

00:55.234 --> 00:57.334
You don't remember it,
but you will.

00:57.401 --> 00:58.800
Ahh.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.434
So this is a dream?

01:00.501 --> 01:01.800
It's time to get up, Artie.

01:01.867 --> 01:03.200
It's time to go.

01:03.267 --> 01:04.967
W-where?
where am I going?

01:05.034 --> 01:07.301
Back to the beginning.

01:13.467 --> 01:14.534
Yeah?

01:14.601 --> 01:16.401
No more zoos, okay?

01:16.467 --> 01:18.701
From now on,
if an artifact is at a zoo,

01:18.768 --> 01:20.134
We leave it there.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.167
Monkey's spit.

01:21.234 --> 01:22.534
Artie, do you know that?

01:22.601 --> 01:23.933
They--they spit,
and it is not pleasant.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.100
Guys, guys, guys--
tell him about the cheetahs.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.334
No, I don't want to think
about the cheetahs, right?

01:28.401 --> 01:29.867
I just--I just--
I want a bath.

01:29.933 --> 01:31.501
All right,
I知 sorry about all that.

01:31.567 --> 01:32.634
I'm dealing
with a lot here too, okay?

01:32.701 --> 01:34.100
Oh, right.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.701
Have you found out who's
hacking into the warehouse?

01:35.768 --> 01:37.601
I can't pinpoint
the origin of the breach.

01:37.668 --> 01:38.900
It's a little frustrating.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.301
Sleep.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.933
Artie, you look--
you look terrible.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.167
Thank you very much.

01:43.234 --> 01:45.367
You still have
some monkey phlegm in your hair.

01:45.434 --> 01:46.833
It's not--
is that--

01:46.900 --> 01:47.933
It's not phlegm.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.900
Look, Artie, uh, just--

01:49.967 --> 01:51.900
Myka's right.
get some rest, bro, okay?

01:53.701 --> 01:55.234
Look, just get back here
as soon as possible.

01:55.301 --> 01:56.200
We have a lot to do.
okay?

02:08.668 --> 02:11.167
Oh, no, I-I can't get up.

02:11.234 --> 02:12.900
Yes, you can.
try.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.000
I can't.
-

02:24.000 --> 02:25.367
How'd you get in here?

02:25.434 --> 02:27.501
I'm disappointed, Artie.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.967
I figured you'd have me
totally clocked by now.

02:30.034 --> 02:31.200
I don't--I don't--
do I know you?

02:31.267 --> 02:33.933
What's going on?
oh, I知 hurt.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.434
Well, it was a while ago.

02:35.501 --> 02:38.134
I was a lot younger,
so were you.

02:41.367 --> 02:42.668
Looking for this?

02:42.734 --> 02:44.833
Dude, an alarm system?

02:44.900 --> 02:46.601
So not groovy.

02:46.668 --> 02:49.401
Besides, this is
you-and-me time right now.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.100
Yeah, it's funny.

02:51.167 --> 02:55.867
Years ago, I swear you said you
were just a simple professor.

02:55.933 --> 02:58.601
I guess you left out
the, uh, off-the-grid,

02:58.668 --> 03:00.768
Top-secret warehouse full
of madcap.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.900
Claudia.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.501
Claudia Donovan.

03:10.501 --> 03:12.234
You're the breach.

03:12.301 --> 03:14.501
Knock, knock.

03:14.567 --> 03:15.867
Yeah, uh, I知 sorry.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.334
I really don't have time
for games,

03:17.401 --> 03:18.701
And these cuffs,
they're not gonna stop me.

03:18.768 --> 03:20.367
Oh, I know, but check this.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.367
It's supercharged cuffs, see?

03:27.434 --> 03:29.067
20,000 volts.

03:29.134 --> 03:32.601
Designed it myself.

03:32.668 --> 03:34.200
You like?

03:34.267 --> 03:36.067
Well done.
thank you.

03:36.134 --> 03:37.867
Now chill.
I知 not in the mood.

03:39.768 --> 03:44.100
Kid, look, that was a long,
long, long time ago, that stuff.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.367
Time flies, professor.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.301
It really does.

03:51.534 --> 03:53.634
I'm not responsible
for Joshua痴 death.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.734
Claudia, look,
just stop it right now

03:55.800 --> 03:57.467
Before you do something
you regret.

03:57.534 --> 03:59.833
I regret?
me?

03:59.900 --> 04:02.267
Oh, have you got it
back-asswards.

04:02.334 --> 04:04.933
You're responsible
for what happened.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.933
But, hey, it's all good.
you know why?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.367
'cause it's payback time
for me and for Joshua.

04:09.434 --> 04:12.434
So let's go, Artie.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.200
Time to make good
on your promise.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.567
The door's open.

04:34.634 --> 04:37.367
That's not good.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.134
Artie would never leave
his Farnsworth.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.534
Yeah.

04:58.601 --> 05:01.134
If there were trouble,
Artie would have triggered the--

05:01.200 --> 05:02.534
Alarm?

05:03.000 --> 05:11.000

Warehouse 13 S01 E05</font>

05:50.833 --> 05:52.134
Damn it!
I don't know what else to do.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.401
The cache is wiped,
there's no tracks outside,

05:53.467 --> 05:55.000
And there's no clues in here.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.534
All right, don't worry, okay?

05:56.601 --> 05:58.100
We'll figure it out somehow?
don't worry?

06:01.234 --> 06:02.734
Could that be Artie?

06:08.367 --> 06:09.933
I'm calling for Artie.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.601
You two are decidedly not he.

06:11.668 --> 06:12.833
Mrs. Frederic, hi.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.067
Oh, look, we got
some really bad news.

06:15.134 --> 06:16.501
Look, Artie's gone.
someone took him.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.401
That doesn't happen.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.401
Agents don't get taken out
of the warehouse.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.601
Our security system is--

06:23.668 --> 06:26.267
Oh.
I see.

06:26.334 --> 06:27.967
The person who's breached
the security,

06:28.034 --> 06:29.100
He's taken Artie.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.634
Yeah, any idea
who this guy is?

06:30.701 --> 06:32.100
None.

06:32.167 --> 06:35.267
So can we put out an APB
or alert the authorities?

06:35.334 --> 06:38.034
We are the authorities.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.234
What did you learn from
the durational spectrometer?

06:41.301 --> 06:42.367
The spectro--

06:42.434 --> 06:43.867
It shows the afterimages

06:43.933 --> 06:47.100
Of anyone who's been in the room
in the last five hours.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.867
-
you kidding me?

06:48.933 --> 06:50.534
Yeah, that's,
like, our favorite thing,

06:50.601 --> 06:52.534
With all the lights
and so forth.

06:52.601 --> 06:55.167
Once you've ID'd them,
let me know.

06:55.234 --> 06:56.634
And stay put.

06:56.701 --> 06:58.734
I don't need
three missing agents.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.367
Oh, okay,
but, Mrs. Frederic, look,

07:00.434 --> 07:01.867
If we have a lead,
we could just--

07:01.933 --> 07:04.067
Consider yourself
under lockdown.

07:10.034 --> 07:11.367
I know this place.

07:11.434 --> 07:14.567
It's a lab.
it's Joshua痴 old lab.

07:14.634 --> 07:15.933
Come on.
away from the door.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.067
I'm fine right here.

07:17.134 --> 07:18.534
Think so?

07:18.601 --> 07:22.434
Uh, or there.
there is very good too.

07:22.501 --> 07:25.234
You're doing this
all wrong, Claudia.

07:25.301 --> 07:27.668
Brought me here in daylight,
used my car.

07:27.734 --> 07:29.668
These are amateur moves,
Claudia, and for what?

07:29.734 --> 07:31.167
What are you gonna do to me?

07:31.234 --> 07:32.867
You gonna kill me
because a long, long time ago,

07:32.933 --> 07:34.267
Your brother died
in an accident?

07:34.334 --> 07:36.734
Come on.
he's not dead.

07:38.401 --> 07:40.800
Claudia?

07:40.867 --> 07:43.334
Claudia, it was a terrible,
terrible accident,

07:43.401 --> 07:45.267
But we both witnessed it,
and he's gone.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.768
No, no, no, no.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.334
He's not.
he's stuck.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.900
Listen to yourself.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.933
No, this isn't in my head!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.668
You're gonna see.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.401
Be careful.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.668
Okay, okay.

08:02.734 --> 08:06.301
Um, let's--
let's open this baby up,

08:06.367 --> 08:09.367
See what she's got.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.534
That's cool.

08:13.601 --> 08:15.800
Wow.
okay.

08:15.867 --> 08:18.000
That is crazy.
all right.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.167
Okay.
wow.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.768
Okay.
okay.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.634
Strange person of authority.

08:41.701 --> 08:42.701
Who is that?

08:42.768 --> 08:43.933
I don't know.
who--

08:44.000 --> 08:45.434
Hold on.
who is that?

08:45.501 --> 08:46.467
Hang on.
I don't know.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.467
Hang on.

08:48.534 --> 08:49.768
Do you have it?
okay, yes.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.434
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

08:51.501 --> 08:54.768
Okay, there we go.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.833
And...that's--

08:57.900 --> 09:00.933
Okay, that's weird.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.601
Did you see that?

09:02.668 --> 09:04.967
Was he saying something?

09:05.034 --> 09:09.401
What did--
what is he saying?

09:09.467 --> 09:11.267
Do you--yeah.
go--go--yeah.

09:11.334 --> 09:14.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:14.867 --> 09:16.668
That's a trip.

09:20.334 --> 09:21.800
It's--I can't.

09:25.634 --> 09:27.100
"Claudia Donovan."

09:27.167 --> 09:28.434
How did you--

09:28.501 --> 09:30.167
My sister taught me
how to read lips.

09:30.234 --> 09:31.434
Why does your sister...?

09:31.501 --> 09:34.467
Uh, the deaf find it handy.

09:34.534 --> 09:35.768
You--

09:35.833 --> 09:39.000
Okay, Claudia Donovan...

09:39.067 --> 09:41.067
Where are you now?

09:47.134 --> 09:49.301
Mrs. Frederic
said we should stay here.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.734
Really?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.668
I didn't hear that.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.967
Neither did I.

09:57.034 --> 09:59.467
Uh-oh, looks like
she was institutionalized.

09:59.534 --> 10:01.200
What if
she's dangerous, Pete?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.900
So, okay, this is what?

10:02.967 --> 10:05.067
This is poetic justice,

10:05.134 --> 10:07.900
Bringing me back
where it all started?

10:07.967 --> 10:10.900
No, we're here
because it's strongest here.

10:10.967 --> 10:15.200
We need that if you're
gonna bring Joshua back.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.467
Back?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.100
You did a nice job on these,
by the way.

10:19.167 --> 10:20.734
What's conducting the charge?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.701
Is that a lithium filament?
it's very fine craftsmanship.

10:22.768 --> 10:23.900
Dude, just shut it down.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.867
Dude, can we not?

10:25.933 --> 10:27.434
Claudia, you are--
you are not well.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.000
All right.

10:29.067 --> 10:31.467
Joshua's death

10:31.534 --> 10:33.434
Was...

10:33.501 --> 10:35.467
He got
the rules wrong, Claudia.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.267
Yeah, 'cause he got sloppy,
didn't he, right?

10:38.334 --> 10:41.933
We both know why he did that,
don't we, Artie?

10:45.167 --> 10:47.567
Is Claudia in some kind of
trouble with the secret service?

10:47.634 --> 10:49.367
In the four years
that Claudia lived here,

10:49.434 --> 10:50.800
Did she ever give you
any problems?

10:50.867 --> 10:53.034
No, not at all.
she was very nice.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.501
Well, what can you tell us
about Claudia?

10:55.567 --> 10:58.367
Well, I知 not one to gossip,
but you might not know.

10:58.434 --> 11:00.800
She lost her parents
when she was just a child.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.734
Poor thing.
her brother raised her.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.833
Then a few years later,
he passed too.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.701
Can you believe it?

11:06.768 --> 11:09.634
More bad luck
than a turtle on his back.

11:09.701 --> 11:12.167
She went off to live
with a foster family.

11:12.234 --> 11:14.768
Well, if you ask me, I think
it all just finally hit her.

11:14.833 --> 11:17.234
And then six months ago,
she checked herself

11:17.301 --> 11:19.267
Into a psychiatric-care clinic.

11:19.334 --> 11:21.134
You know about that?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.000
Of course you do.
you're the government.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.434
You probably know what pills
I take in the morning.

11:25.501 --> 11:29.000
Anyway, she keeps up
on her rent.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.933
She checked herself out
two months ago.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.534
Has she contacted you?

11:32.601 --> 11:34.434
Well, no, I haven't seen her.

11:34.501 --> 11:35.900
She's got
a home base somewhere.

11:35.967 --> 11:39.401
Did she ever, um--
did she ever stay with friends?

11:39.467 --> 11:40.634
I don't think so.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.800
She kept to herself.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.200
No boyfriends, no girlfriends.

11:44.267 --> 11:47.034
I'm very nonjudgmental.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.967
Here we are.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.867
Thank you, Mrs. Richman.

11:52.933 --> 11:54.167
We'll just take
a look around.

11:54.234 --> 11:57.234
I guess I can trust
the secret service.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.067
Oh, boy.

12:19.334 --> 12:20.833
I'm guessing
this is the brother.

12:28.034 --> 12:30.000
Uh, I don't want to sound
like a broken record,

12:30.067 --> 12:32.267
But what makes you think
that Joshua痴 still alive?

12:32.334 --> 12:35.668
'cause dead people
don't visit, Einstein.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.867
Oh, he--he visits you?

12:37.933 --> 12:39.768
Yeah, a lot lately.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.601
Your brother Joshua
visits you,

12:42.668 --> 12:44.967
And he tells you he's not dead?

12:45.034 --> 12:46.567
Yes.

12:46.634 --> 12:48.800
I'm not appreciating the snark,
by the way.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.401
Rheticus was right, you know?

12:51.467 --> 12:52.800
His theories?
no, no.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.401
Joshua was right too.
he was this close to proving it.

12:54.467 --> 12:57.067
No, Rheticus' experiments
were never re-created.

12:57.134 --> 12:59.367
Never.
he was nuts!

12:59.434 --> 13:01.434
Joshua's gone.

13:01.501 --> 13:04.701
You are gonna be so put down
when he gets here.

13:04.768 --> 13:06.867
Yeah? well, you know,
I値l take my chances.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.067
God.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.401
It's about
the minerals, professor,

13:10.467 --> 13:11.867
The minerals in the metal.

13:11.933 --> 13:13.900
That's what
should have made it all work.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.768
Sure.
you know what I知 sensing here?

13:15.833 --> 13:17.734
That this
is kind of a private chat.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.967
Some brother-sister thing.

13:19.034 --> 13:20.967
What do you need me for?
-

13:21.034 --> 13:22.701
Because I took it
as far as I could,

13:22.768 --> 13:26.601
And now I need you
to help me bring him home.

13:26.668 --> 13:27.867
You made me a promise.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.234
Something's wrong.

13:29.301 --> 13:31.234
That's what I致e been saying,
you fossil.

13:31.301 --> 13:33.200
God.
something's wrong.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.900
I can't--

13:35.967 --> 13:37.867
I can't--

13:37.933 --> 13:40.800
I can't--

13:40.867 --> 13:43.501
Professor,
I知 Joshua Donovan.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.434
Joshua?

13:46.501 --> 13:48.401
Are--
yeah, I remember this.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.800
This is when I met you.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.267
We've met before?

13:52.334 --> 13:53.668
Yes.
no.

13:53.734 --> 13:56.668
Well, you showed me
your experiment.

13:56.734 --> 14:00.301
You thought I was here
to give you a grant, and...

14:04.000 --> 14:05.534
That been happening a lot?

14:05.601 --> 14:07.701
What?

14:07.768 --> 14:11.034
You went back.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.567
N-no.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.067
I have the visions too.

14:14.134 --> 14:15.668
We're mad connected, Artie.

14:15.734 --> 14:17.434
The difference between us is...

14:17.501 --> 14:20.467
I-I-I didn't ignore them.

14:23.701 --> 14:25.900
What's wrong?
-

14:25.967 --> 14:27.668
What's the matter
with you, Claudia?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.134
It usually happens
just before.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.900
Just before what?

14:30.967 --> 14:33.034
You're gonna want to sit down
for this.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.900
He's here.

14:37.534 --> 14:40.301
Joshua!

14:43.534 --> 14:45.900
What is that?
what is happening?

14:50.534 --> 14:51.768
Joshua!

14:51.833 --> 14:54.501
Joshua?

14:58.267 --> 15:00.067
Joshua!

15:12.068 --> 15:14.068
Told ya.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.267
What the hell was that?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.200
I don't--I-I don't understand
what just happened.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.501
What's going on?

15:21.567 --> 15:24.100
I mean, what the hell was that?

15:24.167 --> 15:26.601
That was Joshua.

15:26.668 --> 15:28.200
No.
yeah.

15:28.267 --> 15:30.034
You saw it too.
I知 not crazy.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.167
Yes.

15:32.234 --> 15:34.800
Yes, I sa--I-I saw Joshua.

15:34.867 --> 15:35.800
How?

15:35.867 --> 15:37.200
Because he's not dead.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.768
Now you know it too.
help me bring him back.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.367
Well, I-I-I wouldn't know
where to start.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.067
Well, I致e got
everything here.

15:45.134 --> 15:47.234
The Feldkirch minerals,
equipment for an electric field.

15:47.301 --> 15:49.167
Claudia,
did you try to re-create

15:49.234 --> 15:51.200
Joshua's experiment
on your own?

15:52.867 --> 15:54.833
Oh, you're such a creaker.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.601
Yeah, of course I did.

15:57.668 --> 16:00.434
The question is,
why didn't you?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.900
So far, none of this stuff
is telling me

16:08.967 --> 16:11.833
Where Claudia
might have taken Artie.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.134
Are you finding anything?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.900
For a kid, she seems pretty
focused on the 16th century.

16:16.967 --> 16:19.067
She's definitely a thinker.

16:19.134 --> 16:21.000
Always dangerous.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.933
Rheticus.
Rheti-who?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.634
He was a, uh, mathematician
and mapmaker,

16:25.701 --> 16:28.534
A student of Copernicus.

16:28.601 --> 16:31.567
Yes, Pete,
I read books growing up.

16:31.634 --> 16:34.234
Right.
why go to the prom?

16:34.301 --> 16:36.867
Of course you did.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.234
Yeah, three times
in one night.

16:39.301 --> 16:40.401
Mm.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.367
It's a long story.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.534
I bet it is.
I bet it is.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.301
Well, it looks
like our girl genius

16:46.367 --> 16:48.234
Took something with her.

16:48.301 --> 16:50.167
Just--
you know, just to clarify,

16:50.234 --> 16:52.967
You decided to re-create
a clearly dangerous,

16:53.034 --> 16:55.234
Potentially deadly experiment?

16:55.301 --> 16:57.401
Oh, sure. it sounds bad
when you say it like that.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.833
Claudia,
these are very real forces

16:58.900 --> 17:00.034
That you're playing with here.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.234
And if you stop to think--

17:01.301 --> 17:02.634
Chill out, obi-wan, okay?

17:02.701 --> 17:04.467
I'm trying to save
my brother's life here.

17:04.534 --> 17:07.501
I really hope that we are trying
to save it together.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.833
Look, I致e spent
the last two years of my life

17:09.900 --> 17:12.833
Trying to figure out
what happened to Joshua.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.967
And when I reached the end
of what I could do,

17:15.034 --> 17:17.067
I just kind of sort of took
a peek at your research.

17:17.134 --> 17:18.567
W-what?
you took a peek?

17:18.634 --> 17:19.768
You hacked

17:19.833 --> 17:22.134
Into highly classified
government files.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.534
Ooh, I知 all puckered.

17:23.601 --> 17:25.800
You know, imagine my surprise
when I discovered

17:25.867 --> 17:27.501
That you had done nothing
to help him.

17:27.567 --> 17:28.800
In 12 years, nada.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.833
I thought he was dead.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.200
Oops.
wrong.

17:32.267 --> 17:33.601
Now you can help.

17:33.668 --> 17:35.134
Don't tell me
you don't want to.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.833
I know you have guilt.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.634
Hey.

17:38.701 --> 17:39.701
Hey, look at me!

17:39.768 --> 17:41.933
I don't.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.967
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, professor.

17:45.034 --> 17:46.401
Hey, you all right?

17:46.467 --> 17:48.034
I'm fine.
lay off.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.768
Oh, yeah, you're fine.
yeah, sure.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.301
The nosebleed is, what,
just for fun?

17:51.367 --> 17:53.567
Oh, damn it.
I致e been jamming for answers.

17:53.634 --> 17:55.367
I'm just a little burned out.

17:55.434 --> 17:56.634
Yeah, and then
I知 just gonna guess

17:56.701 --> 17:57.833
That it's getting
a little worse?

17:57.900 --> 17:59.200
Uh, o-okay.

17:59.267 --> 18:00.867
It's, like, three or four
times a week now.

18:00.933 --> 18:02.167
But it's just stress.

18:02.234 --> 18:03.768
I mean, you get stressed,
you get the flu.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.933
Everybody knows that.
it's not the flu, dummy.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.567
You're so close to this,

18:06.634 --> 18:08.200
You can't see that it's your
connection to the experiment

18:08.267 --> 18:09.701
That's making you sick.
no, please.

18:09.768 --> 18:12.301
It's--it's just--
it's...

18:12.367 --> 18:14.334
It's just...

18:14.401 --> 18:15.601
Yeah.

18:15.668 --> 18:17.434
Rheticus was attempting
human teleportation,

18:17.501 --> 18:18.601
So was Joshua.

18:18.668 --> 18:23.334
It's beyond dangerous.

18:23.401 --> 18:25.267
Look, it'll be...

18:25.334 --> 18:27.200
A little easier for me
to see what you've got

18:27.267 --> 18:30.467
If you took off the cuffs.

18:30.534 --> 18:33.100
"when love is lost
and loss oe'rtakes me,

18:33.167 --> 18:35.833
"the rules of love
then are hidden;

18:35.900 --> 18:38.933
"and chaos rules and order lost,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.933
And hidden then,
my heart, from love."

18:44.000 --> 18:45.867
Hey.

18:45.933 --> 18:47.833
What is that?

18:47.900 --> 18:49.000
Nothing.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.601
Um, nothing.
it's not important.

19:04.701 --> 19:06.067
Hey.

19:06.134 --> 19:08.534
Hmm?

19:08.601 --> 19:10.768
Um, a compass.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.301
Rheticus claimed he owned it,
only no one ever saw it.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.833
It says here
it probably never existed.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.167
It's just...

19:19.234 --> 19:21.668
Folklore.

19:21.734 --> 19:23.668
Okay, now, is it just me,

19:23.734 --> 19:27.668
Or does that sound
all artifact-y?

19:29.634 --> 19:31.768
Well, you've got
the Feldkirch minerals,

19:31.833 --> 19:33.301
And you're using
an electrical field,

19:33.367 --> 19:35.900
But what about the rest?

19:35.967 --> 19:38.067
The compass,
it disappeared with Joshua.

19:38.134 --> 19:41.634
My question is, what are you
using instead of the compass?

19:41.701 --> 19:43.833
Aren't the minerals enough?
uh-uh.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.900
It's the same as the metal
in the compass.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.000
It's the same thing.
uh-uh.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.467
You can't just replace
an artifact

19:48.534 --> 19:49.768
With, you know, something else.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.501
There's always an "x" factor.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.034
Okay, which is maybe
why I need your help,

19:54.100 --> 19:55.900
Which is why you shouldn't
have done this at all.

19:55.967 --> 19:57.134
I'm shutting you down.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.967
No, hey, hey!

19:59.034 --> 20:00.167
You said
you were gonna help me.

20:00.234 --> 20:02.701
What I said was I would look,

20:02.768 --> 20:04.000
Which I now have.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.301
And believe me,
shutting you down...

20:06.367 --> 20:08.800
That is helping you.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.301
Okay, fine.
you know what?

20:10.367 --> 20:12.067
Fine. just do it.
just shut me down.

20:12.134 --> 20:15.200
You abandoned him once.
why shouldn't you do it again?

20:15.267 --> 20:16.401
It isn't like that.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.267
Oh, no,
it's exactly like that!

20:18.334 --> 20:20.867
Joshua and me
on our own again.

20:20.933 --> 20:23.734
It's a good thing
I知 used to it.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.867
I know that
it hasn't been easy.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.134
No.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.701
No, it hasn't been easy.

20:30.768 --> 20:34.200
He was all I had
after our parents died,

20:34.267 --> 20:37.401
And then he was gone too.

20:37.467 --> 20:40.501
He spent his fun years

20:40.567 --> 20:42.900
Sewing girl scout patches

20:42.967 --> 20:46.301
And teaching me
how to fold an omelet...

20:46.367 --> 20:49.367
And then reading
Maria Looney on the red planet

20:49.434 --> 20:50.567
To me every night.

20:53.867 --> 20:57.668
He was a genius who put his life
on hold for me.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.768
None of that's your fault.

20:59.833 --> 21:02.301
I opened a door
to wherever he is,

21:02.367 --> 21:03.467
And now he's in pain.

21:03.534 --> 21:04.867
You saw his face.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.567
That is my fault!
me!

21:06.634 --> 21:08.034
I'm the epic fail.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.867
Claudia,
it is making you sick.

21:09.933 --> 21:12.100
I owe him!

21:12.167 --> 21:14.601
And so do you,
and we're running out of time.

21:14.668 --> 21:16.301
Damn it, Artie!

21:20.334 --> 21:22.933
Help me save Joshua.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.501
It's a pay phone.
what?

21:30.567 --> 21:31.601
Lattimer.

21:31.668 --> 21:33.367
Pete, how are you?
how you doing?

21:33.434 --> 21:34.967
Artie!
Artie, hey, man.

21:35.034 --> 21:36.434
Are you all right?
ask him where he is.

21:36.501 --> 21:37.800
Oh, yeah.
no, I知--I知 okay.

21:37.867 --> 21:39.234
I'm okay.

21:39.301 --> 21:40.668
I'm just here
with an old friend, that's all.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.501
Claudia Donovan.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.534
Very good.

21:43.601 --> 21:44.933
You ready my lips using

21:45.000 --> 21:46.301
The durational spectrometer,
didn't you?

21:46.367 --> 21:47.734
Where is he?
where--wait.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.234
He probably doesn't know.
right, right.

21:49.301 --> 21:53.067
Artie, do you hear anything
like a freeway, machinery?

21:53.134 --> 21:54.768
Train whistles. ask him
if he hears any train whistles.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.200
Guys, hey, hey!

21:56.267 --> 21:59.334
Look, uh, the truth is
that I知 helping her, all right?

21:59.401 --> 22:00.668
You're helping her?

22:00.734 --> 22:02.301
He's helping her?

22:02.367 --> 22:03.933
You're--
you're helping her, Artie?

22:05.668 --> 22:08.200
I figured that you'd be
halfway towards finding us,

22:08.267 --> 22:09.401
But you can stop now.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.034
Did you hear me?
you can stop.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.833
No, Artie,
she's been under observation

22:12.900 --> 22:16.867
At a psychiatric facility,
all right?

22:16.933 --> 22:19.833
Oh, I-I-I had no--

22:19.900 --> 22:21.800
Poor kid.
I didn't know.

22:21.867 --> 22:23.267
No.
no, not poor kid.

22:23.334 --> 22:25.034
Poor Artie.
she's obsessed with you.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.567
She's obsessed
with the warehouse,

22:26.634 --> 22:28.200
And I知 not letting you
stay with her.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.234
What?
you're not letting me?

22:30.301 --> 22:31.634
That's really cute, Myka.

22:31.701 --> 22:33.401
Cute?
cute.

22:33.467 --> 22:35.301
She's cute?
does she have a gun on you?

22:35.367 --> 22:37.668
Okay, look, these kids' lives
were messed up by--

22:37.734 --> 22:39.401
They're in trouble.
I can help.

22:39.467 --> 22:40.567
That's all you need to know.

22:40.634 --> 22:42.833
Well, let us come
and help you.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.100
No, no, no, no!

22:45.167 --> 22:46.933
We have everything we need
to make this work,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.534
And I知 telling you I知 fine.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.734
Well, Artie,
wait, wait, Artie, Artie--

22:52.833 --> 22:54.401
He hung up.

23:11.168 --> 23:12.667
Seriously, you know?

23:12.734 --> 23:15.767
If Mrs. Frederic can call us,
we should be able to call her.

23:15.834 --> 23:18.067
Is there a star 69
on this thing?

23:18.134 --> 23:20.801
Star 69 wasn't invented
when that was made.

23:20.867 --> 23:24.700
No, this wasn't invented
when this was made.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.667
Why doesn't Artie want us
to help him, Pete?

23:27.734 --> 23:29.367
What's going on?

23:29.433 --> 23:32.001
Yes, what's going on indeed.

23:32.067 --> 23:34.534
man, I really hate that.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.567
I believe
I told you to stay put.

23:36.634 --> 23:37.867
No, I-I know.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.600
Um, it's just
that we were going to--

23:40.667 --> 23:43.134
You know, it would be nice
if we could contact you.

23:43.201 --> 23:44.767
We had a lead.
we decided to follow it.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.268
Don't--don't make her angry.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.700
What kind of lead?

23:47.767 --> 23:50.801
Well, uh, Artie is--is
with, uh, Claudia Donovan.

23:50.867 --> 23:52.667
Voluntarily.

23:52.734 --> 23:55.433
Do you know where they are?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.901
It's possible.

23:56.967 --> 23:58.600
But we've got bigger fish.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.967
You need to get down
to the warehouse floor.

24:01.034 --> 24:04.001
Find the San Anselmo grid
on the larkspur shelf,

24:04.067 --> 24:06.400
Number 1021,

24:06.467 --> 24:09.567
Section 40594904.

24:09.634 --> 24:11.834
Wait, we have a right
to know where Artie--

24:11.901 --> 24:13.400
Ms. Bering,
your right extends

24:13.467 --> 24:15.433
Exactly as far
as I say it does.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.600
If Artie is working
with Claudia,

24:17.667 --> 24:20.134
He may be trying to re-create
her brother's experiment.

24:20.201 --> 24:21.867
And that's bad?
where do you work?

24:21.934 --> 24:24.001
Right.
the Rheticus compass.

24:24.067 --> 24:25.234
Yes.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.634
His experiments
were successful.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.168
That's why he didn't disappear
into thin air.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.567
And Joshua did.
yes, something went awry.

24:30.634 --> 24:34.667
You have to glean how Joshua
went wrong 12 years ago.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.934
I still don't understand
why you don't tell us--

24:37.001 --> 24:39.400
What?
tell you where he is?

24:39.467 --> 24:42.534
If you run after Artie

24:42.600 --> 24:44.300
Governed solely
by your affection for him,

24:44.367 --> 24:45.801
You won't be helping him.

24:45.867 --> 24:49.834
I don't think it's a bad thing
to care about Artie.

24:49.901 --> 24:51.433
He needs information,
not emotion.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.834
You go empty-handed,

24:52.901 --> 24:55.034
The experiment ends up
just as it did before.

24:55.101 --> 24:56.567
You're merely
two more lost bodies.

24:56.634 --> 24:58.767
Thank you.

24:58.834 --> 25:01.333
So what are we looking for
on--on the San Anselmo grid?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.767
I'm not certain.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.300
But every artifact
in this warehouse

25:05.367 --> 25:07.534
Is an extension of a person.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.268
Understand Rheticus,
understand the compass.

25:11.367 --> 25:13.700
And for the record,
I care a great deal

25:13.767 --> 25:16.268
What happens to Artie.

25:21.168 --> 25:23.168
"Glean."

25:23.234 --> 25:24.801
Ms. Fancy.

25:24.867 --> 25:27.201
You're lucky that I have
an emergency travel kit

25:27.268 --> 25:29.134
In the trunk of my car.

25:29.201 --> 25:33.201
Well, "serendipity"
is my stripper name.

25:33.268 --> 25:35.168
Okay, so without the compass,

25:35.234 --> 25:36.433
What I知 hoping
is that some of these

25:36.500 --> 25:37.700
Will be able to help us get

25:37.767 --> 25:39.333
A much, much stronger
electrical charge

25:39.400 --> 25:41.801
Than what you were able to get
using conventional means.

25:41.867 --> 25:44.201
Now, to electrify
the Feldkirch minerals

25:44.268 --> 25:48.168
To a higher frequency...

25:48.234 --> 25:49.934
Ben Franklin痴 lightning rod.

25:50.001 --> 25:51.767
I thought
his thing was a key.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.801
Oh, no, no, no.
everybody fixates on the key.

25:53.867 --> 25:56.101
No, no, please.
this is much, much better.

25:56.168 --> 25:58.168
Trust me.
well, um, what about--

25:58.234 --> 25:59.567
Ah!

25:59.634 --> 26:01.867
That's terrifying.

26:01.934 --> 26:05.234
Uh, listen, um, I heard
about the psych ward.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.801
I had no idea.
I知 sorry.

26:06.867 --> 26:08.634
Yeah, well...

26:11.634 --> 26:14.268
Hey.
it's his journal.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.168
Take a look.

26:16.234 --> 26:17.268
Joshua's?

26:17.367 --> 26:19.901
Mm-hmm.

26:19.967 --> 26:22.201
Okay.

26:22.268 --> 26:24.400
See, this is--
that's the rubbing at the edge--

26:26.867 --> 26:28.801
"Useless."

26:28.867 --> 26:30.367
"Useless."

26:30.433 --> 26:32.333
"Useless."

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
"Useless."

26:34.467 --> 26:37.300
I'm guessing Artie thought
these things were useless.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.967
I mean, they're
all Rheticus gadgets,

26:40.034 --> 26:41.634
But none of them tripped
Artie's trigger.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.667
Okay, so Joshua had to follow
all these rules

26:43.734 --> 26:45.934
To try and make
the compass work, right?

26:46.001 --> 26:47.168
The kid even figured out

26:47.234 --> 26:48.867
This complicated
differential equation.

26:48.934 --> 26:50.134
He was a genius.

26:50.201 --> 26:51.567
Yeah, and the compass
still didn't work.

26:51.634 --> 26:53.500
Well, it half worked.

26:53.567 --> 26:54.967
Ooh.

26:55.034 --> 26:56.500
What is that?

26:56.567 --> 26:58.567
It's en--it's engraved
with the--the letter "t."

26:58.634 --> 27:00.467
"t."
why not an "r" and why "t"?

27:00.534 --> 27:01.967
I don't know what it means.

27:02.034 --> 27:04.867
Okay, look, Artie's notes
said that Rheticus' work

27:04.934 --> 27:07.168
Often expressed
a need for order.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.201
So what did Joshua miss?

27:09.268 --> 27:12.834
I mean, maybe he translated
something wrong, or--

27:12.901 --> 27:15.134
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. maybe.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.534
What are you doing?

27:16.600 --> 27:19.067
Rules and order, right?
right.

27:19.134 --> 27:21.600
Okay, well, after spending
the last couple of months

27:21.667 --> 27:24.500
With someone who also likes
those things--

27:24.567 --> 27:26.734
Uh, you know,
crosswords, puzzles.

27:26.801 --> 27:29.500
I like puzzles.
so?

27:29.567 --> 27:31.400
So...

27:38.500 --> 27:42.201
So did Rehticus.

27:42.268 --> 27:44.201
A secret panel.

27:44.268 --> 27:46.367
I'm increasing the power
of the electrical field here

27:46.433 --> 27:49.734
By about 17 times
where you had it,

27:49.801 --> 27:51.534
So you might want
to stand back.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.500
Yeah, standing isn't really
an option right now.

27:54.567 --> 27:55.600
You all right?

27:55.667 --> 27:57.001
Oh, super.
what?

27:57.067 --> 27:58.801
Artie, he's almost here.

27:58.867 --> 28:01.901
I know.
I...

28:01.967 --> 28:03.433
Uh, I-I feel a--

28:03.500 --> 28:07.300
Uh, I feel...

28:09.067 --> 28:13.101
Feels like something familiar.

28:13.168 --> 28:14.600
Listen,
I know, I know, I know.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.268
It's all, uh--
it's all folklore.

28:21.234 --> 28:25.034
I-I know this place.

28:25.101 --> 28:26.767
I know this place.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.500
Professor?

28:28.567 --> 28:30.534
I-I have found all
of the instructions that I need.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.333
I have the equation
for the electrical field.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.634
I have all of these things.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.901
Nobody believes
that Rehticus succeeded.

28:35.967 --> 28:37.967
I mean, it's probably
just a bedtime story, Joshua.

28:38.034 --> 28:39.801
That's what you think.

28:39.867 --> 28:43.201
Joshua doesn't get the concept
of being nice to the money guy.

28:43.268 --> 28:44.867
Ah.
do you want the professor

28:44.934 --> 28:46.667
To recommend you
for the grant or not?

28:46.734 --> 28:48.901
See, Claudia here doesn't get
the concept of being ten.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.700
Joshua, please don't do this.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.367
It's okay, professor.

28:53.433 --> 28:55.567
He may be antisocial,
but he's very smart.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.134
He knows what he's doing.

28:57.201 --> 28:59.001
Does he?

28:59.067 --> 29:01.034
This.

29:01.101 --> 29:03.634
This is his compass.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.801
I know I can re-create
what Rehticus did.

29:06.867 --> 29:09.667
It's teleportation, professor.
please don't.

29:09.734 --> 29:11.300
Hey...

29:11.367 --> 29:12.834
Trust me.

29:19.101 --> 29:21.634
I started having
the dreams two years ago.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.234
It's what got me started
on all this.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.867
It's because
we were both here.

29:26.168 --> 29:27.867
Hang in there, kid!

29:27.934 --> 29:30.234
This should be
a good first run!

29:30.300 --> 29:32.367
May be able to slow him down
with this one!

29:32.433 --> 29:34.801
Yeah, got it.
hold--hold on.

29:34.867 --> 29:38.333
Claudia.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.801
Claudia!

29:40.867 --> 29:42.500
Claudia!

29:42.567 --> 29:45.034
Claudia!

29:47.034 --> 29:48.134
Claudia.

29:50.534 --> 29:52.367
Claudia.

29:56.801 --> 29:58.934
Man, this guy was nuts
for secret panels.

29:59.001 --> 30:00.268
Yeah,
and they weren't mentioned

30:00.333 --> 30:01.767
In any of Claudia's books.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.201
Yeah,
and if she didn't know,

30:03.268 --> 30:05.333
It's a safe bet that Artie
and Joshua didn't know.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.867
You see the writing
around these edges?

30:06.934 --> 30:09.300
Yeah, it's Latin.

30:09.367 --> 30:10.467
Oh.

30:10.534 --> 30:11.734
Let me guess.

30:11.801 --> 30:13.134
You speak Latin too.

30:13.201 --> 30:14.567
Okay,
make one more nerd joke,

30:14.634 --> 30:17.734
And I知 gonna point out
how you're losing your hair.

30:17.801 --> 30:19.001
Okay, so the rules, right?

30:19.067 --> 30:20.600
The rules are in Latin,

30:20.667 --> 30:26.101
And rules teach us
how to use the objects.

30:26.168 --> 30:30.234
So Joshua took them
off the compass himself.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.567
Yeah, but he was
missing something.

30:33.634 --> 30:35.534
Rheticus hid some rules.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.767
And Joshua never saw them.

30:37.834 --> 30:38.901
Nice.

30:38.967 --> 30:39.934
Hmm.

30:59.117 --> 31:00.851
You don't have it
high enough yet, Artie.

31:00.918 --> 31:03.684
I'm stuck.
no, Joshua, I-I can help you!

31:03.751 --> 31:05.684
No, Claudia's tied
to this now.

31:05.751 --> 31:07.018
It's killing her.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.817
And you, you're tied
to this now too.

31:08.884 --> 31:10.984
She's the one
I知 worried about.

31:11.050 --> 31:15.918
Joshua, if you come back
twice more...

31:15.984 --> 31:17.584
I can hold you here!

31:17.651 --> 31:19.083
I can save you both!

31:19.150 --> 31:21.150
No, will you look at her?

31:21.217 --> 31:22.651
This place is growing
increasingly unstable,

31:22.717 --> 31:24.117
And it's getting worse.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.784
Next time I show up here,
it'll kill her, okay?

31:26.851 --> 31:29.517
Listen, you have
to cut the tether.

31:29.584 --> 31:31.317
All right, overload
the electrical field.

31:31.384 --> 31:33.851
Just--the conductor
you're using--

31:33.918 --> 31:35.751
The, uh, lightning rod?

31:35.817 --> 31:38.150
Yeah. blow it up.
just use that.

31:38.217 --> 31:40.584
No, that'll
destroy the whole--

31:40.651 --> 31:42.984
It'll kill you, Joshua!

31:43.050 --> 31:44.083
I know.

31:44.150 --> 31:45.551
You can't save us both.

31:45.617 --> 31:47.350
To save her,
you have to kill me.

31:47.417 --> 31:49.250
Do it before I知 pulled
back here again.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.183
So there's something hidden
on the compass.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.117
And we think it's the rule
that Joshua missed.

32:02.183 --> 32:03.350
Nicely done.

32:03.417 --> 32:04.684
Right, yeah?
now check this out.

32:04.751 --> 32:06.217
In Artie's notes,
it said that Joshua

32:06.284 --> 32:08.784
Had everything that he needed
for his experiment in his lab.

32:08.851 --> 32:10.150
Where it was locked up
for 12 years.

32:10.217 --> 32:11.484
But before Artie hung up,

32:11.551 --> 32:13.284
He said that he had everything
that he needed.

32:13.350 --> 32:14.417
Bing, bang, boom.

32:14.484 --> 32:16.584
Claudia took Artie to the lab.

32:16.651 --> 32:18.050
You took the initiative,

32:18.117 --> 32:19.651
And you recognized
what needed to be done,

32:19.717 --> 32:20.684
All in Artie's absence.

32:20.751 --> 32:21.751
I'm pleased.

32:21.817 --> 32:23.117
I know, right?

32:23.183 --> 32:24.050
score

32:26.384 --> 32:27.951
Why the test?

32:28.018 --> 32:29.584
Was Artie going somewhere?

32:29.651 --> 32:30.751
Let's hope not.

32:30.817 --> 32:33.217
The directions are in the file.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.150
You should get
to that lab and quickly.

32:35.217 --> 32:36.984
We don't know how much time
we've got left.

32:40.817 --> 32:42.217
Do you think she's weird?

32:42.284 --> 32:44.484
I think she's weird.
she always acts weird.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.784
Joshua come--
come and gone already?

32:52.851 --> 32:55.117
Yeah.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.984
"Craptastic."

32:57.050 --> 33:00.417
Here.

33:00.484 --> 33:02.684
Well, at least we're closer
to bringing him back.

33:02.751 --> 33:04.018
Okay, you all right?

33:04.083 --> 33:05.918
Yeah, no, I知 fine.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.350
Listen.
yeah?

33:08.417 --> 33:10.250
Thank you.

33:17.617 --> 33:19.450
Teleportation
is such a powerful weapon,

33:19.517 --> 33:22.317
And people want it, Joshua.

33:22.384 --> 33:23.817
They're gonna come get it.

33:23.884 --> 33:25.083
Well, I think I致e finally
solved the equation.

33:25.150 --> 33:26.651
Listen to me.
I could just lay low.

33:26.717 --> 33:28.183
Listen to me.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.717
People--the people--

33:29.784 --> 33:31.217
The people that want it,
want it now.

33:31.284 --> 33:33.250
They're coming after you
right now.

33:33.317 --> 33:35.183
There's no time left, Joshua.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.384
What you have to do
is you have to...

33:38.450 --> 33:40.284
Protect yourself.

33:40.350 --> 33:44.018
Just protect your family.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.417
Just give me
the compass temporarily.

33:46.484 --> 33:50.417
I know exactly where to put it
where it'll be safe.

33:50.484 --> 33:52.584
It's, um...

33:52.651 --> 33:54.450
It's in my professor's office.

33:54.517 --> 33:56.517
Good.

33:56.584 --> 34:00.083
You stay with Claudia
till I get back.

34:00.150 --> 34:01.918
I'll just be a minute.

34:01.984 --> 34:03.350
Hey, thank you, professor.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.284
Sure.

34:10.617 --> 34:12.384
Hey, what are you doing?

34:12.449 --> 34:14.350
I made a promise
to your brother,

34:14.417 --> 34:17.018
And I知 not gonna let
anything happen to you.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.250
What?

34:19.317 --> 34:21.684
We're blowing this up.

34:21.751 --> 34:23.183
That'll kill Joshua.

34:23.250 --> 34:24.884
Artie, you have to put
that back.

34:24.951 --> 34:27.484
You have to have the field
ready to catch him.

34:27.551 --> 34:28.951
No, no, no, no, no.

34:29.018 --> 34:33.050
That'll kill you,
and I don't care if you hate me.

34:33.117 --> 34:35.183
I'm not gonna let you die too.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.384
I do hate you.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.984
I'm never gonna forgive you.

34:38.050 --> 34:39.817
He's on his way.

34:39.884 --> 34:42.918
Good.
that's good.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.884
What's wrong?

34:45.951 --> 34:47.817
Huh?
oh, nothing.

34:47.884 --> 34:50.650
Yes, something.

34:50.717 --> 34:52.449
What?

34:52.516 --> 34:54.650
Uh, it's just your brother.
he should be back by now.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.018
You know what?
why don't we go check on him?

35:00.083 --> 35:02.450
Okay?

35:04.951 --> 35:06.317
Don't worry.

35:06.384 --> 35:08.584
I won't let anything
happen to Joshua, I promise.

35:08.651 --> 35:13.384
Claudia, I don't have much time
before it starts again.

35:13.450 --> 35:15.884
I'm sorry...

35:15.951 --> 35:17.884
For everything.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.517
But I致e got to save
one of you.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.884
Showtime.

35:23.951 --> 35:25.551
Showtime.

35:26.784 --> 35:28.183
Artie!

35:30.684 --> 35:32.517
Joshua!

35:41.117 --> 35:44.317
I told you not to do this!

35:44.384 --> 35:46.951
I told you not to follow me.

35:47.018 --> 35:49.417
Okay, well, dock our pay.
we came here to save you.

35:49.484 --> 35:50.751
Is that Claudia Donovan?

35:50.817 --> 35:52.284
Yes, yes, she's--
she's just unconscious.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.784
What? what?

35:53.851 --> 35:55.851
Joshua didn't have
all the rules, Artie.

35:55.918 --> 35:57.450
Rheticus loved puzzles.

35:57.517 --> 36:00.018
And his designs
had secret panels.

36:00.083 --> 36:01.717
It's inside?

36:01.784 --> 36:03.183
It's inside the compass.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.617
Yes, in Latin.
where is it?

36:04.684 --> 36:06.317
Artie, where is the compass?

36:06.384 --> 36:07.684
We just have to pop open
the panel

36:07.751 --> 36:09.884
And find out which rule it is,
so where is it?

36:09.951 --> 36:12.350
I don't--I don't--
I don't have it.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.517
I had to try, Artie.

36:14.584 --> 36:17.684
I couldn't give up
without trying.

36:17.751 --> 36:19.150
Once you said that there was
no more time left,

36:19.217 --> 36:20.751
I had to prove
that I could teleport.

36:32.284 --> 36:36.384
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

36:36.450 --> 36:38.617
Artie, what are you doing?

36:38.684 --> 36:41.150
I'm--I知 doing
what Joshua did.

36:41.217 --> 36:43.918
No, no!
that's how he died!

36:43.984 --> 36:45.751
He's not dead.

36:45.817 --> 36:47.484
Claudia?

36:47.551 --> 36:49.918
I think I can save him.

36:49.984 --> 36:52.284
I thought
what I have to do--

36:52.350 --> 36:54.617
Don't do this!

36:54.684 --> 36:56.384
Artie!

36:56.450 --> 36:58.217
Artie, make him stop!

36:58.284 --> 36:59.717
You promised!

36:59.784 --> 37:01.417
Claudia, it's okay.

37:01.484 --> 37:05.217
Remember,
I will always, always--

37:10.484 --> 37:13.250
Artie, what's happening?

37:13.317 --> 37:15.417
It's not over.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.250
Joshua?

37:19.484 --> 37:21.651
Touch my hand.

37:25.018 --> 37:27.717
Joshua!

37:38.951 --> 37:41.250
Uh, okay.

37:41.317 --> 37:42.717
Where the hell are we?

37:42.784 --> 37:45.450
Claudia, Artie, you're here.

37:45.517 --> 37:47.083
Joshua.

37:47.150 --> 37:49.851
Look at you.
you--

37:49.918 --> 37:51.484
I can't believe you're here.

37:51.551 --> 37:54.050
Yeah, I知 here.
I知 here.

37:54.117 --> 37:56.183
Wait.
I知 here?

37:56.250 --> 37:57.851
You took me
to the inter-dimensional space?

37:57.918 --> 37:59.350
You were supposed
to get him out, d-bag.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.517
No, he was supposed
to destroy it.

38:00.584 --> 38:01.717
Clearly, he's insane.

38:01.784 --> 38:03.350
Children,
don't fight, please.

38:03.417 --> 38:04.684
I can be both a d-bag
and insane.

38:04.751 --> 38:06.284
Just where's the compass?

38:06.350 --> 38:07.984
It's right there.

38:19.050 --> 38:20.651
All right.

38:20.717 --> 38:24.417
Rheticus put rules
right on objects,

38:24.484 --> 38:26.317
Sometimes inside objects.

38:26.384 --> 38:27.651
A hidden panel.
yeah.

38:27.717 --> 38:29.918
Yes, yes, yes.

38:29.984 --> 38:31.517
In this case...

38:34.350 --> 38:35.817
It requires a combination,

38:35.884 --> 38:38.918
But they didn't mention
a combination.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.217
Wait.
Letters or numbers?

38:40.284 --> 38:41.751
It's letters, but--
how many?

38:41.817 --> 38:43.651
I mean, there's
20-something letters.

38:43.717 --> 38:46.551
Artie,
try t-h-o-m-a-s.

38:46.617 --> 38:48.817
Why?
"Thomas."

38:48.884 --> 38:50.851
Rheticus wrote a poem,
the loss of reason,

38:50.918 --> 38:52.651
About his lost love,
somebody named Thomas.

38:52.717 --> 38:55.018
Thomas, okay.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.250
How did I miss that?

39:06.317 --> 39:08.083
Ah, Latin.

39:08.150 --> 39:09.484
Oh, crap.
no, no, no, no.

39:09.551 --> 39:10.984
It's fine.
I can read it.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.517
It's just directions.

39:15.584 --> 39:19.884
It's just,
"move the dial 90 degrees

39:19.951 --> 39:22.484
Towards axis."

39:22.551 --> 39:26.417
I'm no expert,
but maybe hang on?

39:26.484 --> 39:28.851
Okay, touch....

39:43.884 --> 39:46.417
Artie?

39:46.484 --> 39:47.817
Are you okay?

39:54.584 --> 39:57.551
Thought we lost you, buddy.

39:57.617 --> 39:58.918
Oh, thanks.

39:58.984 --> 40:02.484
Thanks for not giving up.

40:02.551 --> 40:04.417
Shut up!

40:09.317 --> 40:11.417
So the secret-panel thing--

40:11.484 --> 40:14.117
I got to say, very nice work.

40:14.183 --> 40:15.784
Well, we were motivated.

40:15.851 --> 40:17.684
You know, maybe you
should ditch us more often.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.350
I'm really sorry about that.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.083
If you ever do that again,
I知 not finding you,

40:21.150 --> 40:22.450
And I quit.

40:22.517 --> 40:24.083
Yeah, just out of curiosity,
by the way,

40:24.150 --> 40:27.018
How exactly did you figure out
the secret-panel thing?

40:27.083 --> 40:30.450
Well, each artifact is an
extension of the person, Artie.

40:30.517 --> 40:32.517
We gleaned what we needed
from the person.

40:32.584 --> 40:34.684
Mm-hmm.

40:34.751 --> 40:36.551
Mrs. Frederic.
I thought so.

40:36.617 --> 40:38.784
No, hey, hey, you know what?
she's pretty scary, man.

40:38.851 --> 40:40.183
If we hadn't found something,

40:40.250 --> 40:42.317
She probably
would have glared us to death.

40:42.384 --> 40:44.851
Yeah.
you have no idea.

40:48.018 --> 40:50.684
What?

40:50.751 --> 40:54.018
It's just, um...

40:54.083 --> 40:55.951
It couldn't have been easy
losing someone

40:56.018 --> 40:58.117
On the job like that.

40:58.183 --> 41:00.617
It wasn't.

41:00.684 --> 41:04.317
Well, you know, if you
ever want to talk about it--

41:04.384 --> 41:06.050
I don't want to talk
about it.

41:06.117 --> 41:10.117
Okay.

41:10.183 --> 41:11.717
Oh.

41:11.784 --> 41:15.217
Oh, um, you know, unless
you want to talk about it.

41:19.417 --> 41:22.018
I mean, unless you wa--

41:22.083 --> 41:26.150
Look, anytime you want to talk
about it is fine, okay?

41:26.217 --> 41:27.617
Okay.

41:27.684 --> 41:28.751
Okay, bye.

41:28.817 --> 41:30.284
Bye.
Bye.

41:42.584 --> 41:44.284
Hello, Mrs. Frederic.

41:44.350 --> 41:46.350
Arthur.

41:49.651 --> 41:51.551
An in-person visit.

41:51.617 --> 41:54.317
Must have done
something right...

41:54.384 --> 41:55.684
Or wrong.

41:55.751 --> 41:58.250
It's a little of both.

41:58.317 --> 42:00.784
I had to go back.
I know.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.050
I was responsible...
back then.

42:04.117 --> 42:05.851
You wanted him to teleport?

42:05.918 --> 42:07.450
Oh, I thought he could do it.

42:10.284 --> 42:11.951
No.

42:12.018 --> 42:15.551
I knew it, so I pushed him.

42:15.617 --> 42:19.150
And he was lost for 12 years.

42:19.217 --> 42:23.183
And you might have prevented
it all...

42:23.250 --> 42:26.651
And I might have saved Gus,
but I didn't.

42:26.717 --> 42:29.717
We make mistakes.
some people are lost.

42:29.784 --> 42:31.951
We can't save everyone--
something to keep in mind

42:32.018 --> 42:33.951
Regarding Mr. Lattimer
and Ms. Bering.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.651
That's not why I知 here.

42:35.717 --> 42:36.684
Then why?

42:36.751 --> 42:40.450
Um, the girl, Claudia?

42:40.517 --> 42:43.951
We didn't do a very good job
of protecting her, did we?

42:44.018 --> 42:46.617
Well, she was determined
to find her brother.

42:46.684 --> 42:48.183
And in the process,
