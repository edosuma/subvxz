22:07.694 --> 22:09.829
Why you didn't run?

22:13.433 --> 22:14.601
[VANESSA] Tell me.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.604
Why you didn't run?

22:20.139 --> 22:22.775
She's still breathing.
She needs help.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.876

22:48.735 --> 22:50.136
That you're broken.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.715
- Why you didn't run?
- What?

23:02.749 --> 23:06.586
Tell me why you didn't run.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.888
I couldn't run.

23:08.921 --> 23:13.192
She was still alive.
She was still breathing.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.964
You were free. Why the fuck
didn't you run, man?

23:17.997 --> 23:22.669
A long time ago,
somebody that I loved died,

23:22.702 --> 23:26.906
And I made a promise
that it wouldn't happen again.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.141
And I...

23:29.175 --> 23:31.978

That's good.
That's good for you

26:37.697 --> 26:39.899
I've seen you before.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.338
Do you remember anything?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.089
I remember you in...

27:04.156 --> 27:06.959
In the hotel, in the bar.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.410
You're Mauricio's friend.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.692
They got into the bank.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.894
What?

27:41.928 --> 27:44.063
But Mauricio says...

27:44.096 --> 27:47.934
That you have the password.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.104
I think they were so close

27:52.138 --> 27:54.040
To getting something
out of Mauricio,

27:54.073 --> 27:56.208
But you show up, man.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.910
What bank?

27:57.944 --> 28:00.312
- Stop pretending!
- I'm not pretending!

28:00.346 --> 28:02.048
I don't know what the fuck
you are talking about.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.951

- Shh!

28:07.453 --> 28:09.822

28:15.494 --> 28:17.730

28:17.764 --> 28:20.132
No, you tell those guys
they're making a mistake.

28:20.166 --> 28:23.235
I am not the one.
They're making a mistake!

28:23.269 --> 28:24.503
- They're wrong.
- Shut up.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.038
They don't give a fuck
about you.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.306
They don't give a fuck
about anything.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.975
You have to tell them
the password,

28:29.008 --> 28:31.811
Or I swear to God they will
torture you and kill me

28:31.844 --> 28:33.312
And shoot me
in the fucking head.

to tell them, huh? What?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.117
- Everything.
- No! I can't tell them.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.854
I tell them anything,
they're gonna fucking kill us.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.456

28:44.490 --> 28:46.525

you can tell me?

I'm not gonna die here.

You are alone, man.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.041
Just grow up, damn it.

29:02.074 --> 29:05.211
Just tell those guys
they got the wrong person.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.013
I'm not the one lying here.
It's Mauricio.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.215

please!

Please don't let them
do anything to me, please.

they got the wrong person.

torture me, please.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.496
Hello.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.200
[MAN] Mrs. Owens, before
I start, I want to tell you...

31:08.234 --> 31:11.137
Look, I don't know if you
realize who are you talking to,

31:11.170 --> 31:13.305
But I swear if you hang up...

31:13.339 --> 31:15.207
I'm perfectly aware
of who I'm talking to

31:15.241 --> 31:17.209
And how delicate
the situation is.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.279
Okay, so you know I'll be
at the door of the ministry

31:20.312 --> 31:21.480
In 15 minutes,

31:21.513 --> 31:23.415
Waiting for them
to open the door for me.

31:23.449 --> 31:26.118
Sorry, ma'am, but I don't think
we have that much time.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.586
Why?

31:27.619 --> 31:31.090
Local law enforcement
and the Colombian Army

31:31.123 --> 31:34.026
Have found your husband's
possible location.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.162
Is he all right?
Where is he?

31:36.195 --> 31:39.131
The vehicle assigned
to your husband by our company

31:39.165 --> 31:41.300
Has a satellite
tracking system.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.169
Wait, what?

31:43.202 --> 31:45.037
So you knew where he was
from the beginning

31:45.071 --> 31:46.705
And you
only mention it now?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.507
Oh, not quite.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.078
Do you know how much trouble
you and your company are in?

31:52.111 --> 31:53.946
We're not liable
for these events,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.547
But we are doing
everything in our power.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.250
No, excuse me, excuse me!

31:58.284 --> 32:00.552
You're not going to
get out of this so easily!

32:00.586 --> 32:03.455
Ma'am, we don't have time
to argue!

32:03.489 --> 32:08.360
The most important issue
is your husband.

32:08.394 --> 32:12.031
Okay. Why do you say
we don't have much time?

32:12.064 --> 32:14.500
Right. Approximately
two hours ago,

32:14.533 --> 32:19.972
An army anti-kidnapping unit
went by land and surrounded

32:20.006 --> 32:23.375
The point where we think
your husband is located.

32:23.409 --> 32:28.380
I'm personally on a helicopter
that'll provide air support.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.050
So why haven't you
rescued him yet?

32:31.083 --> 32:34.453
Over land travel
takes time, Mrs. Owens.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.690
You have to promise me
you'll bring him back alive.

32:38.724 --> 32:42.361
That's precisely
why I'm calling.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.597
Mauricio Yacca's parents have
approved the armed incursion,

32:45.631 --> 32:50.369
And we have their sign-off
for a hostile extraction.

32:50.402 --> 32:54.740
You have to promise me
you'll bring him back alive.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.476
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't do that,

32:57.509 --> 33:01.347
But I do need your sign-off
to execute the operation.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.382
No, I can't.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.384
I have to consult
with my family first.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.686
Excuse me, ma'am,
we don't have time.

33:07.719 --> 33:12.224
The team will be on site
and in position in 15 minutes.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.126
And the sun's about to rise.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.495
If that happens,
we lose our tactical edge.

33:16.528 --> 33:20.132
No, I can't, I can't.

33:20.166 --> 33:23.202
Ma'am, I need your answer now.

33:23.235 --> 33:27.273
Will you authorize
a Colombian Army operation

33:27.306 --> 33:29.808
To perform
a hostile extraction

33:29.841 --> 33:33.179
Of American citizen
Mark Owens?

33:33.212 --> 33:36.282
Please answer yes or no.

33:36.315 --> 33:39.118
I can't.

33:39.151 --> 33:43.322
I can't decide that.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.158
Do I take that
as a negative?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.160
I need you to understand

33:48.194 --> 33:51.797
I will be forced
to abort the operation.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.634
Wait, wait.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.770
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

33:58.804 --> 34:02.308
In regard to your decision,
we wish to repeat

34:02.341 --> 34:06.078
That our company
is not liable in any way

34:06.112 --> 34:10.081
And that we are joining
the operation as observers.

34:10.116 --> 34:13.119
- Is this clear to you?
- Yes

34:13.152 --> 34:15.554
Mrs. Owens,
in the name of our firm,

34:15.587 --> 34:17.789
We wish to ratify
our concern about...

34:19.324 --> 34:20.659

I don't know.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.862
I don't know. I don't know

36:03.895 --> 36:07.933
Don't fuck with me, man!
Where the fuck is the key?

36:07.966 --> 36:11.270
Fuck! I don't know about
any key, I swear to God!

- No, you're not an engineer.

I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

36:22.448 --> 36:25.451
I don't know. I don't know
anything about banks.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.553
[VANESSA]
They got into the bank.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.421
Mauricio has told them
everything.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.690
Now they need a fucking key
to transfer the money.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.593
I don't know!
I don't have any key.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.762
[VANESSA]
I don't want to die here.

36:36.795 --> 36:37.863
[MARK] Oh, Jesus.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.268
Tell me something.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.504
I don't know!

36:45.537 --> 36:47.239
You don't know what?
You don't know Mauricio?

36:47.273 --> 36:49.575
I don't know Mauricio!
He's not my friend!

36:49.608 --> 36:51.477
I just got here!

36:53.412 --> 36:54.713
I'm an engineer.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.383
I come here,
I help with the refineries,

36:57.416 --> 36:59.551
I help with contracts.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.320
That's what I do.

37:01.353 --> 37:05.857
The name of my company
is Owens Company.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.559
[Speaking Spanish]

37:07.593 --> 37:09.361
[MARK] I'm an engineer!

37:09.395 --> 37:11.363
[Speaking Spanish]

37:12.898 --> 37:15.534
[Speaking Spanish]

37:16.902 --> 37:19.871
Please tell me something
about Mauricio.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.941
Mauricio is
a son of the owner.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.644
He knows more about
the bank accounts,

37:25.677 --> 37:27.979
About all the information,
he knows all that.

37:28.013 --> 37:30.382
Just tell him to check it out,
and he'll see.

37:30.416 --> 37:34.520
[Speaking Spanish]

37:36.422 --> 37:37.689
Perro.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.860
[VANESSA] Where is the key?

37:41.893 --> 37:46.565
You're gonna get both killed.
Please, where is the key?

37:46.598 --> 37:47.799
What's your name?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.301
Mark.

37:50.769 --> 37:54.039

Hey, fuck, I didn't do shit.
Come on.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.465
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Relax, man, take it easy.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.778
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.618
Always the right things
go wrong with me.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.721
Don't be saying that.

39:54.526 --> 39:57.062
Why you choose Carla
and not me?

40:00.632 --> 40:03.969
Why you pick her?

40:04.002 --> 40:06.872
I don't know,
I can't remember.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.616
I should change
the color of my hair, no?

40:19.217 --> 40:22.688
- Your hair?
- Yeah.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.089
[Speaking Spanish]

40:24.122 --> 40:27.626
The blondes have more fun,
don't you think?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.705
Was she your friend?

40:43.108 --> 40:49.047
We worked together many years,
so yeah, she was my friend.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.718
- You guys are like escorts?
- Hookers?

40:52.751 --> 40:55.020
I was gonna say escorts.

40:55.053 --> 40:59.658
No, no, no. What's the problem
to being a fucking whore?

41:01.092 --> 41:02.561
I'm sorry.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.096
- I just, um...
- No, no, no.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.668
Have you ever been
with a whore?

41:09.701 --> 41:12.971
'Cause last night
you were fucking one.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.240
I wasn't fucking her.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.243
[Chuckles]

41:18.276 --> 41:20.211
Why's that?

41:23.949 --> 41:27.586
Maybe you couldn't get it up,
but you want to fuck her.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.855
Is it not the same?

41:34.893 --> 41:38.564
[Distant screaming]

41:38.597 --> 41:40.766
Jesus Christ.

41:54.613 --> 41:57.015
Are you friends
with Mauricio?

42:01.787 --> 42:05.624
I know him for a year,
almost a year.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.726
Together we make fun
of the other girls

42:07.759 --> 42:11.930
Because he like to act
like a gringo.

42:11.963 --> 42:15.033
I thought maybe you guys were
good friends or something.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.203
I thought he was
full of shit, you know?

42:18.236 --> 42:21.106
When he's sober,
he's this quiet guy.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.174
But when he gets drunk,

42:23.208 --> 42:27.579
He's like, he likes to play
el gran señor.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.621
You have a boyfriend?

42:35.654 --> 42:37.055
A boyfriend?

42:37.088 --> 42:38.957
Yeah, I mean, why not?

42:38.990 --> 42:41.593
Why can't a girl like you
have a boyfriend?

42:41.627 --> 42:43.662
[Speaking Spanish]

42:43.695 --> 42:46.932
All my clients
are my boyfriends.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.641
You speak pretty good English.

42:55.674 --> 42:56.742
Thanks.

42:56.775 --> 42:58.343
Where'd you learn?

42:58.376 --> 43:00.879
I took some classes.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.948
- Some classes?
- Yeah.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.616
Why?

43:04.650 --> 43:06.718
Don't laugh at me, please.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.389
A friend of mine,
she get married with a gringo,

43:11.422 --> 43:15.827
And I just wake up
and say to me like,

43:15.861 --> 43:18.363
"I want that for me."

43:18.396 --> 43:20.732
What happened?

43:25.136 --> 43:27.673
I just ended like a whore.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.278
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't be sorry.

43:33.311 --> 43:35.013
I don't regret it.

43:35.046 --> 43:38.083
Knowing English
has given me so much.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.721
How's that?

43:42.754 --> 43:47.225
Look, all the gringos
are coming to Colombia,

43:47.258 --> 43:51.262
And you guys rather have
a girl like Carla than me,

43:51.296 --> 43:54.365
So knowing English
give me extra money.

43:54.399 --> 43:57.803
So why would you want
to marry an American?

43:57.836 --> 44:03.308
Every girl in Colombia
wants to marry a boy like you.

44:07.345 --> 44:09.280
Do you have a girlfriend?

44:10.348 --> 44:11.817
Four.

44:11.850 --> 44:14.419
You have four girlfriends?
Look at you!

44:14.452 --> 44:17.222
[Laughs]

44:17.255 --> 44:20.358
I have four girlfriends
altogether.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.764
You only slept
with four women...

44:25.797 --> 44:28.233
In your entire life?

44:33.271 --> 44:38.043
No. I've slept with six.

44:38.076 --> 44:39.711
Seven.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.414
Do you have a girlfriend?

44:48.186 --> 44:51.923
I was married,
or I'm married.

44:51.957 --> 44:56.061
Are you married
or divorced or what?

44:56.094 --> 45:00.365
No, I'm married, but I...

45:02.233 --> 45:05.436
I don't know what's gonna
happen now. I mean...

45:05.470 --> 45:08.273
Nothing's gonna happen
because nothing happened.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.341
- Yeah, right.
- Nothing happened, Mark.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.978
You know, it just was...

45:13.011 --> 45:17.215
The night is good,
the meat is weak.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.951
Who's gonna tell her?
No one.

45:25.490 --> 45:29.494
[Distant screaming]

45:29.527 --> 45:32.297
[Screaming continues]

45:39.404 --> 45:40.839
We're gonna die.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.208
No, we're not gonna die.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.010
How do you know that?

45:45.043 --> 45:47.145
Because I know.

45:52.183 --> 45:55.186
We're gonna get out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.790
Now just...

46:03.995 --> 46:06.064
Listen to me.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.934
I'm gonna take you
to the United States with me.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.236
We're gonna get the hell
out of here,

46:11.269 --> 46:14.472
And everything is
gonna be fine.

46:14.505 --> 46:15.473
I promise.

46:19.144 --> 46:21.512
I'm a whore,
but I'm not stupid.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.915
- I don't lie.
- How can you help me?

46:23.949 --> 46:25.817
I help people like you
all the time.

46:25.851 --> 46:29.187
I help people
that help people like you.

46:29.220 --> 46:32.157
- Are you a priest or something?
- No!

46:35.961 --> 46:38.329
I can get you out of here.

46:45.270 --> 46:48.273
Please, I'm serious.

46:48.306 --> 46:51.042
Don't never promise something
that you can't accomplish.

46:51.076 --> 46:53.244
We're gonna get out of here.

46:53.278 --> 46:54.846
- Yes, we are.
- No.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.447
If you don't talk about
the password,

46:56.481 --> 46:58.016
They're gonna kill us.

46:58.049 --> 46:59.885
I don't fucking know
about any of that.

46:59.918 --> 47:02.553
I don't know any banks,
I don't know about the key.

47:02.587 --> 47:03.989
Let me explain to you
something

47:04.022 --> 47:05.924
Because I think
you don't get it.

47:05.957 --> 47:07.492
They're not playing any games.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.360
If you don't tell them
what they want,

47:09.394 --> 47:11.262
They're gonna torture you
and murder us.

47:11.296 --> 47:12.998
No, you listen to me,
goddamn it.

47:13.031 --> 47:14.966
If we tell those motherfuckers
what they want,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.936
They're gonna come over here
and they're gonna kill us.

47:17.969 --> 47:19.304
I don't want to die here.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.339
Okay, we're gonna
get out of here.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.008
We got a deal?

47:23.041 --> 47:25.543
- We got a deal?
- They're coming.

[Speaking Spanish]

47:55.606 --> 47:57.575
Okay, what's going on?

47:57.608 --> 48:01.947
They got into the bank,
but they blocked the account.

48:01.980 --> 48:03.314
[Speaking Spanish]

48:04.615 --> 48:06.017
They're bringing Mauricio.

48:06.051 --> 48:08.286
- What?
- Yeah.

48:08.319 --> 48:10.455
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

48:14.692 --> 48:16.294
What's wrong with you?

48:16.327 --> 48:19.464
- Why did you tell them?
- What?

48:19.497 --> 48:23.068
They're gonna bring Mauricio,
and they're gonna torture him!

48:23.101 --> 48:24.970
They are gonna be
torturing you!

48:25.003 --> 48:26.271
So now they're gonna
torture him?

48:26.304 --> 48:28.139
- Do you want to live?
- Yes!

48:28.173 --> 48:30.575
Try not to be
so fucking naive, Mark.

48:30.608 --> 48:33.378
Okay, do you realize
what we're into here?

48:33.411 --> 48:34.980
- Yes.
- So?

48:36.647 --> 48:38.549
Look, I was with him,

48:38.583 --> 48:42.220
And he's not that faithful dog
that you think he is.

48:42.253 --> 48:45.656
Look, if he dies,
it's gonna be...

48:45.690 --> 48:50.228
The only thing left that
they need is the access key.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.230
That's it.

48:52.263 --> 48:54.232
Do you know something
about the fucking key, Mark?

48:54.265 --> 48:55.233
No!

48:55.266 --> 48:57.035
So?

48:58.436 --> 49:00.171
We just need to buy time.

49:00.205 --> 49:02.307
Time for what, Mark?

49:02.340 --> 49:04.475
Do you know something
about the key or not?

49:04.509 --> 49:06.444
No, I don't.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.446
They're coming.
They're gonna save us.

49:08.479 --> 49:11.449
- They're gonna rescue us.
- Who? Who's gonna save us?

49:11.482 --> 49:13.184
We're in the fucking middle
of the jungle in Colombia!

49:13.218 --> 49:15.620
- They've got their ways!
- Who? Who fucking who?

49:15.653 --> 49:17.155
The embassy!
They're gonna be here.

49:17.188 --> 49:18.589
They're gonna
get us out of here.

50:15.413 --> 50:21.452

[MARK] No, the key
looks like a beeper.

50:58.389 --> 51:02.160
Looks like a keychain.
Shit!

51:02.193 --> 51:05.463
I don't know, something small.
Just tell him to look for it.

51:05.496 --> 51:07.732
[VANESSA] Look at me! The next
time you open your mouth,

51:07.765 --> 51:10.501
You have to tell me where
the fuck is the key, man.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.337

51:30.788 --> 51:32.390
[MAURICIO] She slipped
something into your drink.

51:33.691 --> 51:35.393
He doesn't have
anything to lose, Mark.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.562
He wants some money,
and we have nothing, man.

51:37.595 --> 51:38.829
Don't listen to him.

51:38.863 --> 51:40.531
What the fuck's going on?

She tells me you get tortured,
you tell them everything.

for the bank,

And the only thing
that's left is the key.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:39.016
All right, and you're gonna
tell them how it works.

She's gonna be the first one
they're gonna kill.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:04.541
What do you want me
to do about it, huh?

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:07.444
Well, I'm not
gonna let her die.

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:10.547
I'm not gonna let those
fucking bastards kill her.

about her?

That blonde girl, Mauricio,
they fucking killed her.

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.296
She told me.
She said...

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.199
She said that they
weren't kidding around,

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:31.635
They weren't fucking around,
that they were gonna kill her.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:33.603
And I didn't believe her,
and they killed her.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.940
It's my fault.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:38.208
It's my fault she's dead.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:40.344

She's just a whore, man,
a piece of meat.

Look, I'm not gonna die
because of you or anybody.

Oh, wow, that's a big
fucking surprise.

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:16.213
She's a human being.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.683
She deserved to live
just as much as you or me.

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:24.488
Really? More than me?

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:28.993
Yeah! Hell yeah! She...
It's our fault she's here.

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:33.363
Hey, if I had to pick
between her and myself,

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:34.664
I'm gonna pick myself.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:36.466
I'm not a fucking idiot
like you are.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.469
No, you're not.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:41.438
You're a fucking loser.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:47.044
I'm practical, Mark.
I'm practical.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.512
Let me ask you something.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:51.281
They asked Vanessa to choose
between herself and you.

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:53.350
Who the fuck do you think
she would pick?

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:56.053
Jesus, Mauricio, I couldn't
make a decision like that

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:58.222
Out here
in the fucking jungle.

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.457
Of course not.

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.492
You're such a goddamn
fucking noble prick.

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:05.362
You know what? I don't give
a fuck what you think of me.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.397
Look...

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:09.433
[Groans]

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:13.537
We all know I don't really care
what they're gonna do to me.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.473
But we've gotta stick together
and gain some time.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.708
Time? What, are you
fucking kidding me?

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:22.446
We're doomed! Jesus Christ!
They're gonna fucking come here!

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.349
I got a fucking wife!
They're gonna come here!

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:27.117
They're gonna
fucking kill us!

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:30.187
We're worth so much more
alive than dead! Get that!

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.256
They're gonna come back
any moment now!

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:35.259
They're gonna torture us!
We gotta stick together!

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:38.795
Okay, just tell them about
my fucking family, all right?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.131
Look, I don't know.
They can negotiate something.

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:43.800
That will give us time.
You speak fucking Spanish.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.036
You tell them
about my fucking family.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:50.474
They don't want any money.
We just gotta stick together.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.147
[Distant door closes]

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:02.219
- Fuck.
- I think they're coming back.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.588
Oh, shit.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:57.174
[Speaking Spanish]

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:59.376
[VANESSA] Mauricio told him
there was $6 million

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:00.377
In the bank.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:03.647
[Speaking Spanish]

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.750
[VANESSA] But there's
$60 million in the bank.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:09.586
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Everything was okay.

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:12.356

[Speaking Spanish]

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.425

[Speaking Spanish]

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:24.868

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:35.912
What deal?

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.381
[MARK] I don't know
the password.

01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:40.850
This is not the perfect moment
to play games, Mark.

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:44.488
Tell me what the fuck
is going on here, man.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.756
I don't have a deal with him.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.258
[VANESSA] Don't lie to me, Mark!

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:50.794
- I'm not lying.
- Bullshit!

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:52.429
You had the key
from the beginning.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:56.366
Do you remember putting
your jeans on last night?

01:08:59.703 --> 01:09:03.207
You put it in my fucking pants!
It's his fucking bank!

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.576
Why in the fuck would I have
the key on my pants?

Remember last night
while you fucked that 'ho,

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.397
And she moaned and squealed
like a fucking hog?

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.299
Stop! She's my friend!
Don't talk like that!

Say the fucking password!

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:23.287
[MARK] It's not even
my fucking bank.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.423

Of course she does.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:58.888
They are my clients.

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.490
She fucking sold us out.

He was gonna steal your money.
He has all planned out, Mark.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.914
He was telling everyone he was
going to steal your money, Mark.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.551
She drugged you.
That's why we're here.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:30.354
You gave me the fucking drug,
motherfucker!

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:32.322
Jesus, you drugged me?

We call it burundanga.
It's the drug of truth.

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:37.026
She's lying.

Mauricio, what's she
fucking saying, man?

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:50.740
She's lying to you.
She's fucking lying.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:53.577
You were gonna steal
from your own father?

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.545
- He's not my father.
- What do you mean?

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:58.815
Fine! I'm his son,
but he treats me like shit.

Mark...

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:05.088
I'm worthless.
I have nothing.

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:07.657
No, wait, we've got a deal.
We're gonna make it through.

01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.393

As soon as he can,
he's gonna sold you out, man.

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:20.604
Sell you out.

I'm not gonna
get through this alive.

- I'm not worth it.
- No, we can get out of here.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:33.683
Maybe you, but we're
not gonna make it.

Yes, yes, we are.
