00:01.305 --> 00:02.959
ABIGAIL:
Previously on Motherland.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.179
ANACOSTIA: You killed your own
daughter for this freak show.

00:05.222 --> 00:07.877
That was your beloved
Bellweather unit.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.661
Does this mean
we can clear our names?

00:09.705 --> 00:12.447
ANACOSTIA: I'm afraid that she
isn't entirely human yet.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.752
SILVER:
The United States Military

00:13.796 --> 00:15.928
along with an Elite
Civilian Force

00:15.972 --> 00:17.713
are preparing to invade
and occupy the Cession,

00:17.756 --> 00:19.193
to root out the traitors

00:19.236 --> 00:21.195
who assassinated
our beloved former president.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.806
TALLY: A trade my sight
for her soul.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.460
ALDER: You're a steward now.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.897
I promise to protect
the stewards at all costs.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.116
[screams]

00:29.159 --> 00:30.943
[thuds]

00:30.987 --> 00:32.902
Marshal track me down
when I didn't want to be found.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.904
Let's see how he likes it.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.427
If Wade and the Marshal are in
the Cession, we'll find them.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.994
And when we do find them,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.778
we can start talking
about my pardon.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.085
SCYLLA: I told you,
I'm not leaving you again.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.088
When we get out of this,
then we'll go away together.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.611
Just the two of us.
That's right.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.309
Straight to the lighthouse.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.832
ABIGAIL: I think we should
turn ourselves in.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.312
We started this together.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.878
RAELLE: We should
end it together.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.925
PETRA: All US Army personnel
will stand down.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.883
This occupation is over.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.759
I'm so proud of you all.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.893
As much as it breaks my heart,
this was a brave decision,

01:07.937 --> 01:08.894
and will save lives.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.462
The occupation had to end.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.334
Seemed like
this was the only way.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.640
Knowing when to withdraw
is the hardest decision

01:15.684 --> 01:16.902
a leader has to make.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.731
I've struggled with it myself.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.516
Good for you.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.388
Silver's troops are on their way
to take you into custody.

01:24.432 --> 01:28.349
Well, it's better than being
executed on the spot, I suppose.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.699
PETRA: The media coverage
should hold them accountable,

01:30.742 --> 01:32.440
at least until you get to DC.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.790
I'm doing everything I can
to try and locate Wade.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.240
[suspenseful music playing]

01:52.024 --> 01:53.765
[exhales sharply]

01:58.944 --> 02:00.729
[groans]

02:00.772 --> 02:02.513
Stay still, stay still,
you're safe Madame President.

02:02.557 --> 02:03.993
-It's okay.
-What's going on?

02:05.995 --> 02:07.562
There was an accident.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.520
The Marshal was driving,

02:09.564 --> 02:11.000
and then suddenly aged
in an instant

02:11.043 --> 02:13.307
and lost control of the car.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.917
[groans]

02:14.960 --> 02:17.049
I think one of his
marshals must've died.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.747
They're connected?

02:18.790 --> 02:20.488
Like Alder and the Biddies.

02:20.531 --> 02:21.837
-Yeah.
-PRESIDENT WADE: Oh.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.669
Oh.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.936
Where are we?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.894
Have you tried to go for help?

02:35.938 --> 02:37.113
No, ma'am.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.984
I couldn't leave you.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.379
And...

02:42.423 --> 02:44.251
we are now completely snowed in.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.863
What about food?

02:52.215 --> 02:54.174
Well, tell me some good news.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.960
We still have
one day's firewood left.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.533
[theme music playing]

04:06.942 --> 04:09.988
[panting]

04:11.773 --> 04:13.905
[groans]

04:13.949 --> 04:15.559
I'm fine.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.909
-[sighs]
-Anything broken?

04:17.953 --> 04:20.738
Um, I don't think so.

04:20.782 --> 04:23.872
They had you a while.
Any surprises?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.526
No.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.223
Pretty much the same
questions you all got.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.530
Petra's plan,

04:29.573 --> 04:32.010
Alder's return and where Raelle
was when she disappeared.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.098
And then...

04:35.797 --> 04:37.538
they asked me about
the First Song.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.758
Alder was right.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.412
The Song must be important

04:42.456 --> 04:45.110
if the Camarilla
are determined to destroy it.

04:45.154 --> 04:48.418
And now that she's gone,
they won't even have to.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.511
They're still being careful
not to leave any visible marks

04:54.555 --> 04:56.557
which means they're planning
on trotting us out in public

04:56.600 --> 04:58.472
-at some point.
-So a trial?

04:58.515 --> 04:59.995
Or a public execution.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.001
What?

05:11.180 --> 05:13.095
We were planning
of getting married.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.230
TALLY: Oh. Congratulations.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.888
We wanted to ask you
and Adil to join us

05:23.932 --> 05:25.890
and make it a double wedding.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.937
RAELLE: Yeah. We know
you've been talking about it...

05:28.980 --> 05:31.940
-Shelby.
-[both chuckle]

05:31.983 --> 05:35.073
ABIGAIL: Um, yeah.
We were talking about it.

05:35.117 --> 05:39.991
But we wanted to wait
until Khalida was back.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.913
Hey.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.915
We can't give up hope.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.874
We don't even know
what they're planning for us.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.005
Yeah.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.837
[thuds]

05:59.881 --> 06:00.969
Put these on.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.148
I guess we're about to find out.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.065
SILVER: We've banned all
spectators from the court,

06:10.108 --> 06:11.762
to make room for the press.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.938
Every second of this trial
will be televised,

06:13.982 --> 06:17.246
it is very important
that we control the narrative.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.943
KARA: Make no mistake,

06:18.987 --> 06:22.556
we could lose this war.

06:22.599 --> 06:26.255
There are still people out there
who don't understand

06:26.298 --> 06:28.170
the danger that witches pose.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.434
And they need to hear every
detail of the Unit's crimes

06:31.478 --> 06:33.697
from the mouths
of the witches themselves.

06:33.741 --> 06:36.047
We'll give them enough rope
to hang themselves...

06:36.091 --> 06:38.746
and then we'll hang them
for real.

06:38.789 --> 06:41.923
SILVER: But we have to make sure
that when we execute them,

06:41.966 --> 06:43.925
they aren't seen as martyrs.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.709
The country needs to be scared.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.929
And we need to tell them
exactly what to be scared of.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.887
KARA: So to be clear,

06:49.931 --> 06:52.890
this is not about
getting a guilty verdict.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.414
That's guaranteed.

06:54.457 --> 06:57.982
Your real jury
is the American people.

06:59.201 --> 07:02.291
[suspenseful music playing]

07:10.430 --> 07:11.735
Everybody out.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.957
[suspenseful music playing]

07:51.993 --> 07:55.083
PROSECUTOR ZANDT: The so called
"Bellweather Unit"...

07:55.126 --> 07:57.781
has committed
a litany of crimes--

07:57.825 --> 08:01.393
and the charges against them
are almost too numerous

08:01.437 --> 08:02.917
to list here.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.658
But I'll give it a shot.

08:05.963 --> 08:10.315
The murder of President
Silver's daughter, Penelope;

08:10.359 --> 08:13.623
the assassination
of former President Kelly Wade;

08:14.668 --> 08:17.975
the deaths of civilian hostages;

08:19.281 --> 08:21.936
aiding and abetting
known terrorists,

08:21.979 --> 08:26.027
conspiring with Nicte Batan,
the leader of the Spree;

08:26.070 --> 08:28.551
the destruction
of private property

08:28.595 --> 08:31.554
in the United States,
as well as the Cession.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.694
She's not getting worse, but...

08:40.737 --> 08:42.913
PETRA: But she's not getting
any better.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.394
If we revealed her
publicly like this,

08:45.437 --> 08:47.265
it would likely make things
worse for the girls.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.834
Anything from Anacostia?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.880
It's been two days
since I heard from her.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.142
Dammit.

08:55.926 --> 08:56.971
[sighs]

09:02.150 --> 09:04.195
PROSECUTOR ZANDT: So, you used
this "Right Of Proxy"

09:04.239 --> 09:06.937
to prevent the lawful execution
of Nicte Batan?

09:06.981 --> 09:08.939
TALLY: I thought I was doing
the right thing, the--

09:08.983 --> 09:10.593
PROSECUTOR ZANDT:
You fought General Alder

09:10.637 --> 09:13.335
to save a terrorist's life,
then aided in her escape?

09:13.378 --> 09:14.902
No. Nicte wanted
to be a martyr--

09:14.945 --> 09:16.947
So, your solution
was to set her free?

09:16.991 --> 09:18.775
TALLY: I didn't set her free.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.342
Did you consider the lives
of the "ordinary" Americans

09:20.385 --> 09:21.952
you endangered by your actions?

09:21.996 --> 09:24.781
Or the lives of those already
lost to the Spree?

09:25.956 --> 09:27.915
I think about them constantly.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.394
PROSECUTOR ZANDT:
How are we to believe you,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.832
when all your actions
contradict that?

09:34.008 --> 09:36.663
[suspenseful music playing]

09:36.706 --> 09:38.360
ALDER: All those years...

09:40.057 --> 09:41.581
the centuries...

09:43.452 --> 09:47.978
with only these
two brutes for company.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.112
What did you talk about?

09:54.942 --> 09:55.986
Hmm.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.295
And now you're off...

10:00.338 --> 10:02.732
Goddess knows where,

10:02.776 --> 10:04.386
seeing the sights.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.962
Good for you.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.708
Should I sing for you?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.755
I feel I should warn you,

10:25.799 --> 10:28.149
this Song...

10:28.192 --> 10:30.630
might bring the mountain
down on our heads.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.937
Any objections?

10:34.938 --> 10:36.418
No?

10:42.990 --> 10:43.991
So be it.

10:46.602 --> 10:49.649
[vocalizing]

11:25.119 --> 11:26.816
PROSECUTOR ZANDT: I want
to know, how do you decide

11:26.860 --> 11:28.688
who lives and who dies?

11:28.731 --> 11:30.907
ABIGAIL: I don't decide,
I follow orders.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.954
We do everything we can
to prevent casualties.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.912
PROSECUTOR ZANDT:
So these crimes you committed,

11:35.956 --> 11:37.261
they were on orders?

11:37.305 --> 11:38.785
ABIGAIL: They weren't crimes.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.309
I think that's up
to the jury to decide.

11:41.352 --> 11:42.527
This is bullshit.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.920
Excuse me?

11:45.879 --> 11:48.708
[whispering indistinctly]

11:50.927 --> 11:52.581
Here's the truth.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.889
Silver is Camarilla,
he poisoned his own daughter,

11:55.932 --> 11:57.934
and tried to kill
President Wade.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.240
We had nothing to do with that.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.285
Move to strike!

12:01.329 --> 12:03.635
Please, if one of us could just
speak without being cut off.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.903
CHIEF JUSTICE: Fine...

12:09.946 --> 12:12.253
one of you may make
a brief statement.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.472
Then we will conclude
today's hearing.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.475
You're up, Rae.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.217
Why aren't you doing it?
Or Tally?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.915
TALLY: You've have one foot
in both worlds.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.917
-It has to be you.
-I can't.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.179
Just tell your story.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.705
[suspenseful music playing]

12:35.929 --> 12:37.408
[exhales]

12:37.452 --> 12:38.845
[clears throat]

12:40.020 --> 12:42.500
I guess I'll start by saying
that Abigail is right.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.112
They're lying.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.419
And Wade's still alive,
for what it's worth.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.988
But it won't matter
because we'll be found guilty.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.948
And this trial will be used
to persecute all witches.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.954
My mother was military.
My father is a civilian.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.131
I didn't want to fight.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.437
I despised the military
because I knew

13:06.481 --> 13:08.962
I would end up dying
just like my mother.

13:09.963 --> 13:13.314
Fighting to protect people
who hated me

13:13.357 --> 13:15.142
just for existing.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.146
But I "said the words,"

13:21.017 --> 13:24.107
and despite all my expectations,
my feelings changed.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.022
I know most of you probably
didn't grow up

13:26.066 --> 13:27.937
around the military or witches,

13:27.981 --> 13:29.678
but we are no different
than you.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.160
We're your daughters.

13:33.203 --> 13:36.641
we're your sons, we're your
neighbors, we're your friends.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.820
If you think our actions
deserve punishment, so be it.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.171
But do not let them
use this trial

13:44.214 --> 13:46.086
to take us back
to the burning times.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.001
-[gavel bangs]
-All right, that's enough.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.004
PROSECUTOR ZANDT:
Unfortunately, you have no proof

13:51.047 --> 13:52.919
to back up your accusations,

13:52.962 --> 13:54.921
or the outrageous assertion

13:54.964 --> 13:57.532
that former President Wade
is still alive.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.621
CHIEF JUSTICE: I'm calling
an end to today's proceedings.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.971
Please escort the defendants
back to their cell.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.366
[chattering indistinctly]

14:05.409 --> 14:06.541

14:12.982 --> 14:14.244
[indistinct chatter]

14:21.643 --> 14:23.993
SILVER: Cut the cameras!
Cut the cameras!

14:26.300 --> 14:28.955
-Colonel Jarrett, arrest them!
-This is for Penelope.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.003
No, no, no. They're imposters!

14:34.047 --> 14:36.484
They can change their faces!
This isn't Wade!

14:37.964 --> 14:40.923
You don't think
it's me, Blanton?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.056
ALL: Oh, my God.

14:43.099 --> 14:44.579
[groans]

14:45.841 --> 14:47.451
Check my fingerprints.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.327
My fellow citizens,

14:53.370 --> 14:57.461
this has been a difficult time
for the nation and for me.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.813
Though I have finally been
reinstated as your president,

15:01.857 --> 15:05.643
let me tell you
that I do not yet feel relief.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.863
Without the heroic bravery

15:07.907 --> 15:10.300
of the People
of the Great River,

15:10.344 --> 15:12.172
I would surely be dead.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.959
I pledge they will have greater
autonomy moving forward,

15:17.003 --> 15:21.094
and that we will be
their strongest ally.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.967
I have also exonerated
the "Bellweather Unit"

15:25.011 --> 15:27.230
of all the charges against them.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.321
I wish I could say
the worst is behind us,

15:31.365 --> 15:34.846
but we still need to deal
with the rot and corruption

15:34.890 --> 15:38.154
that has spread throughout
our country, and beyond.

15:38.198 --> 15:42.115
You've no doubt seen the reports
of Camarilla-led attacks,

15:42.158 --> 15:44.726
taking place around the world.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.468
Including false flag operations

15:47.511 --> 15:53.126
and misinformation meant to
stir up hatred against witches.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.954
I promise you,

15:54.997 --> 15:57.913
we will play a part
in those struggles.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.610
But first...

15:59.654 --> 16:02.874
we must face
our own fractured nation

16:02.918 --> 16:06.661
and prepare
for the difficult road ahead.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.969
The rebuilding and healing
are just beginning,

16:10.012 --> 16:15.017
but I know that together,
we will endure

16:15.061 --> 16:19.195
and we will be stronger
in the end.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.850
ANACOSTIA: Apparently,
The Marshal found out

16:21.893 --> 16:23.156
there was a traitor
on the Council,

16:23.199 --> 16:25.245
just didn't know who
or who they trust.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.116
They were on their way
to a safe house

16:27.160 --> 16:28.813
when the accident happened.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.641
Good thing M
was collecting firewood

16:30.685 --> 16:31.903
or the bats
may never found them.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.601
Nicte?

16:33.644 --> 16:35.646
She took off,
but I'm sure we haven't seen

16:35.690 --> 16:38.258
the last of her,
for better or worse.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.999
What about Hearst and the rest
of the Camarilla?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.826
Most of their "army" scattered.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.959
Disappeared
back into their lives.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.918
Hearst and Kara Brandt
are both still missing, though.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.529
Don't worry.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.660
We'll get them.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.754
So, next week, huh?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.193
Yeah. [chuckles]

17:00.236 --> 17:02.064
How are the preparations going?

17:02.108 --> 17:03.892
Oh, I'm handling everything.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.112
I want to spare everyone
from whatever bizarre,

17:06.155 --> 17:08.375
Necro ceremony
they would have planned.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.333
-So...
-[chuckles]

17:10.377 --> 17:12.553
They're leaving town
for a couple days

17:12.596 --> 17:15.817
and everything will be ready
when they return.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.645
And where are you two going?

17:17.688 --> 17:19.342
Someplace perfect.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.520
SCYLLA: [vocalizing]

17:34.966 --> 17:36.490
ADIL: It's a beautiful song.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.973
That's all it is now.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.976
Great. I gave up
my Sight... [sighs]

17:45.020 --> 17:47.979
which would actually be
helpful right now,

17:48.023 --> 17:50.939
to be a Steward of a song
that might never be sung.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.810
I feel helpless,

17:54.856 --> 17:56.988
and I don't like it.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.688
Hey, Tally! Adil!

18:00.731 --> 18:02.211
Gregorio!

18:04.039 --> 18:05.214
[chuckles]

18:07.477 --> 18:09.000
Abigail said I'd find you here.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.569
I'm glad that you're okay.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.877
I'm so glad to see you.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.314
We heard you were
being held somewhere.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.142
Yeah. I was, uh, imprisoned

18:20.186 --> 18:22.971
for insubordination
toward the Oversight Commanders

18:23.014 --> 18:27.193
and, uh, "interrogated"
for being an associate

18:27.236 --> 18:28.933
of the Bellweather Unit.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.239
Sorry about that.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.675
Don't be.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.678
It's a badge of honor.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.072
[sighs]

18:52.479 --> 18:54.394
I can't believe you brought me
to your lighthouse.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.746
-Finally.
-You like your accommodations?

18:58.789 --> 19:02.010
Like you said...it's perfect.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.504
[chattering indistinctly]

19:18.766 --> 19:19.984
Take care.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.729
Can you believe
we're actually doing this?

19:26.817 --> 19:28.254
Yeah. I can.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.736
Looks like you two are now
officially High Atlantics.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.998
-Nicte?
-[laughs]

19:34.956 --> 19:36.000
Oh.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.178
I'm just passing through
but I wanted to say

19:39.221 --> 19:40.962
congratulations before I go.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.703
Just in the neighborhood, right?

19:42.746 --> 19:44.922
-Something like that.
-No way, Batan.

19:44.966 --> 19:45.923
You're staying.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.403
No. No.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.927
I don't have the clothes or, um,

19:49.971 --> 19:51.625
all right, I'll think about it.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.975
I do hear they have some
fancy food at these things.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.933
Just lobster and everything.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.805
Have fun.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.070
-Hi Dad!
-Hey, genius.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.945
Oh. [chuckles]

20:07.989 --> 20:10.600
-Oh, hello darling.
-Hi, Edwin.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.689
Enjoy that while you can.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.692
In a couple hours, you're gonna
have to start calling me Dad.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.000
[chuckles]

20:22.786 --> 20:25.311
Can you imagine actually
living in a place like this?

20:30.751 --> 20:31.926
Why do I feel like
you're just rounding up

20:31.969 --> 20:33.449
Camarilla in your mind?

20:34.972 --> 20:36.887
Sorry. I just...

20:37.975 --> 20:39.063
they're still a threat.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.502
I can't help but feel
like we're just

20:42.545 --> 20:43.938
whistling past the graveyard.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.505
Hey, hey, hey.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.596
You're not wrong.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.252
And tomorrow morning, we get
back to hunting them down.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.992
-But today...
-Today

20:56.777 --> 20:58.344
we celebrate our friends.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.576
And what would I do without you?

21:15.796 --> 21:17.711
You'll never have to find out.

21:17.754 --> 21:18.799
Hmm.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.544
Um, but right now,
I think there's someone

21:24.587 --> 21:26.023
you need to talk to.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.517
How is it that you're here?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.911
It was Khalida.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.565
She heard me singing
and literally

21:45.608 --> 21:47.349
moved a mountain to get to me.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.614
This girl might be
the most powerful witch

21:51.658 --> 21:52.746
who has ever lived.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.837
I should go find my brother.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.150
I suppose you have
a million questions.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.761
[laughing]

22:09.328 --> 22:10.633
Not a one.

22:19.816 --> 22:20.991
[exhales deeply]

22:25.909 --> 22:28.042
[chuckles] Yeah.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.219
You're more of a scarf guy,
aren't you?

22:31.262 --> 22:32.438
Here...

22:35.832 --> 22:38.182
-[chuckles]
-What?

22:38.226 --> 22:40.924
Nothing, just thinking
about that dinner.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.013
With the prospective mates.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.973
Oh, yeah.
When we were in competition

22:46.016 --> 22:48.236
and you still had dreams
of marrying Abigail.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.934
No, no, no, no. That was
the Imperatrix's dream,

22:50.978 --> 22:51.935
never mine.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.589
Mm-hmm.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.895
[chuckling]

22:55.983 --> 22:58.159
But I'm happy for you.
Things are working out

22:58.202 --> 22:59.856
the way they were supposed to.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.858
Well, not yet.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.860
But one day soon, hopefully.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.209
Whoo.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.776
Wow. You look great.

23:07.821 --> 23:11.041
Now, if you can handle
the rest of it yourself,

23:11.085 --> 23:12.956
I'm going to go find Tally.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.349
-I'm good.
-Yeah.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.655
[chuckles]

23:15.698 --> 23:17.091
Hey,

23:17.134 --> 23:18.788
thank you for everything.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.579
[in foreign language]

23:27.623 --> 23:29.495
[chuckles] You're back.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.931
[exhales deeply]

23:32.846 --> 23:34.978
Adil, there's something
very important

23:35.022 --> 23:36.415
we need to talk about.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.246
Oh, no, no, no.
We can not put the Chasubles

23:42.290 --> 23:44.031
by the Penstocks or we will be
spending all night cleaning up

23:44.074 --> 23:45.424
blood and broken glass.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.077
Hey Abs,
sorry for the late notice

23:47.121 --> 23:49.471
but we've got some
additions to the guest list.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.951
Okay, Rae, it's your day,

23:50.994 --> 23:53.388
so I'm not gonna
stress about it.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.347
Did you miss me?

23:58.045 --> 23:59.960
[laughs]

24:03.006 --> 24:04.878
More than I can say.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.141
And you are now,
finally, out of excuses.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.229
Mm-hmm.

24:11.058 --> 24:12.799
Oh, no.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.844
No, today's supposed
to be about you two.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.106
And this is what we want.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.499
Your whole family...

24:19.458 --> 24:21.982
our whole family is here.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.466
Why wait?

24:31.426 --> 24:32.993
Hey guys, give us a second.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.782
This is crazy, right?

24:39.826 --> 24:42.959
-That I'm even considering this?
-Oh, it is. Completely crazy.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.961
But think of how our lives have
been, ever since we all met.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.659
-Batshit crazy.
-ABIGAIL: Yeah.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.965
And I don't see that
changing anytime soon.

24:49.009 --> 24:49.966
I mean, the rest
of the Camarilla

24:50.010 --> 24:51.446
are still out there

24:51.490 --> 24:52.969
and we have no idea
what's coming for us.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.276
So grab onto something real,

24:55.319 --> 24:58.932
what's beautiful and true,
while you can.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.550
But I don't even have a dress...

25:11.161 --> 25:13.294
You need to go talk
to your grandmother...

25:15.992 --> 25:17.994
-[chuckles]
-A few little tweaks

25:18.038 --> 25:21.432
and it will fit like
it was made for you.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.521
[chuckles]

25:23.783 --> 25:25.959
It's so beautiful.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.395
How have I never seen it before?

25:27.438 --> 25:29.005
Oh, you have.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.878
When you were about this tall.

25:31.921 --> 25:35.272
You got it out and tried it on,
stepping all over it.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.014
Your mother was not amused.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.888
But it has been here ever since,

25:41.931 --> 25:44.107
just waiting for you.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.761
It is a part of our history.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.547
[exhales deeply]

25:50.461 --> 25:53.377
So much of that history
has been lost,

25:53.421 --> 25:55.423
or stolen from us.

25:55.466 --> 25:58.687
But this is a piece
that survives.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.343
And so we cherish it. Hmm.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.301
Just like I cherish you.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.999
[chuckles]

26:08.436 --> 26:10.743
I heard you were here.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.353
What? You didn't really think
you'd seen the last of me,

26:12.396 --> 26:13.789
-did you?
-Hmm, and you're not staying

26:13.833 --> 26:14.964
for the wedding.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.966
Why does that not surprise me?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.968
[exhales sharply] Weddings.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.188
And my work isn't done.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.712
A piece of the Song
still remains to be found.

26:23.756 --> 26:26.106
-Where are you heading?
-Africa.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.543
Tracking the Abyssinian line.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.718
Do you think
that there's a chance

26:29.762 --> 26:30.937
that things have changed?

26:30.980 --> 26:32.765
That we won't need the Song?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.810
I think there's always a chance.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.986
But that's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.599
I'm coming with you.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.167
No.

26:44.211 --> 26:45.952
Mm--because I don't
have my Sight?

26:45.995 --> 26:48.128
Because you have a much
greater part to play now.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.999
And I can't risk your safety.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.959
So, what would you have me
do in the meantime?

26:53.002 --> 26:55.483
Celebrate your loved ones
while you can.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.618

does that leave us?

if she's finally answering me.
