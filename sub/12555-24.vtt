THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:10.837
<i>BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:14.046
<i>IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:16.847
<i>AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.</i>

00:16.934 --> 00:20.552
<i>IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW,</i>

00:20.646 --> 00:23.183
<i>BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:26.186
<i>AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS</i>

00:26.276 --> 00:29.189
<i>AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.</i>

00:29.279 --> 00:31.691
<i>THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:31.782 --> 00:35.320
<i>IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE
CALL THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

THE UNION SOLDIERS
BURNED ATLANTA,

01:16.201 --> 01:19.660
BUT I ASSURE YOU, THEY TOOK
NO PLEASURE IN THEIR VVORK.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.828
THEY WERE FORCED TO IT

01:21.915 --> 01:25.658
BY A MAN THEY HATED MORE THAN
THEY COULD EVER HATE THE REBELS.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.665
AN UGLY, SULLEN,

UNBELIEVABLY BRUTAL MAN

LET ME READ YOU A FEVV EXTRACTS
FROM THE DIARY OF MAJOR SKELTON.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.771
THE DATE IS TUESDAY,
SEPTEMBER 11, 1864.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.440
"THE CITY WAS OURS.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.620
"THERE WAS NO NEED
TO DESTROY AUGHT,

01:59.661 --> 02:03.325
"SAVE THAT VVHICH COULD BE OF

"HE HIMSELF STARTED
THE AWFUL FIRES.

"THE FIRES THAT DESTROYED THAT GREAT

<i>(narrator) IN THE VIEW OF THIS

<i>THAT COULDN'T COME OUT

<i>WHICH IS TO SAY THAT THIS
NIGHTMARE BEGINS AT NOON.</i>

02:43.789 --> 02:46.656
VERY VIVID, VVALTER. YOU HAD
ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.699
THANK YOU, SAM.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.252
I BEGIN TO SEE VVHY THESE
LECTURES OF YOURS ARE SO POPULAR.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.454
IS THAT WHY
YOU SAT IN?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.836
VVELL, PARTIALLY. TELL ME SOMETHING.
VVHO IS THIS MAJOR SKELTON?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.009
OH, JUST A LAWYER
WRAPPED INTO A MIST.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.712
UH, WHAT REGIMENT?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.888
HUNDRED AND TWENTY
THIRD INFANTRY.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.262
I MUST SAY, THE STORY OF HIS

03:06.353 --> 03:08.469
MAY I SEE IT?

03:15.821 --> 03:19.860
I, UH, I DON'T SUPPOSE
I COULD BORROVV IT.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.866
I NEVER LEND BOOKS TO
ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSORS.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.569
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME?

03:24.663 --> 03:26.904
YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.534
ANYTHING WRONG, SAM?

03:28.583 --> 03:32.372
NO. COULD YOU COME
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.295
WHOSE INVITATION?
YOURS OR SUSANNA'S?

03:35.382 --> 03:39.421
MINE THIS TIME.
SAY, 7:00?

03:39.511 --> 03:40.922
ALL RIGHT.

ALWAYS.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.307
<i>PLEASE. REMEMBER,
YOU'RE A PhD.</i>

04:28.393 --> 04:32.102
<i>NOT YET, I'M NOT. THERE'S A LITTLE

<i>A TECHNICALITY. ANYWAY,

THE DEVIL SHE IS.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.311
I'M GIVING YOU MY DAUGHTER'S
HAND, NOT HER BRAIN.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.362
SHE'S GONNA
GET THAT Ph.D.--

04:42.449 --> 04:44.656
IF I HAVE TO SPANK
HER. I KNOW.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.825
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE THE
COOK AGAIN TONIGHT.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.823
INDEED, AND WHY NOT?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.531
VVELL, I THINK IT'S TIME THAT
I TRIED SUSANNA'S COOKING.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.207
DON'T WORRY, YOU WILL.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.955
I'M SURE. WELL,
SHALL WE SIT DOWN?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.792
MY LADY.

05:01.968 --> 05:06.053

NEVER BE THE COOK YOU ARE.

<i>WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, YOUNG LADY?</i>

05:14.481 --> 05:16.017
I'LL DO THE DISHES LATER.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.394
IT'S NOT THE DISHES
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.147
IT'S BOOKS AND
STUDY. UPSTAIRS.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.860
BESIDES, VVALTER AND I
HAVE SOMETHING TO DISCUSS.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.863
<i>YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT
ME THIS WAY, ARE YOU?</i>

05:27.953 --> 05:31.321
<i>WORSE. WHO KNOWS'? YOU
MAY HAVE TO SUPPORT US.</i>

05:40.382 --> 05:42.999
YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, SAM.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.088
SUSANNA'S ALMOST
30 YEARS OLD.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.919
AND I'M ALMOST 70.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.515
MM-HM.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.598
MY MOVE, ISN'T IT?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.471
YES.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.627
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.797
LOOK AT THEM.
EXTRAORDINARY, ISN'T IT?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.626
THEY LOOK VERY
MUCH ALIKE.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.212
TWELVE YEARS AGO,
THOSE TWO HANDS.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.346
TIME MARCHES ON.

06:31.433 --> 06:35.142
<i>FOR SOME OF US. WALTER, TELL
ME SOMETHING, WILL YOU?</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:37.469
OF COURSE.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.680
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.482
FORTY-FOUR.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.817
I SEEM TO RECALL THAT VVHEN YOU APPLIED
FOR A POST ON THE UNIVERSITY STAFF,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.494
YOU LISTED
YOUR AGE AS 39.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.539
THAT WAS,
LET ME SEE, 1947,

06:57.626 --> 06:59.663
WHICH WOULD
MAKE YOU 51.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.836
COME ON, SAM.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.915
ALL RIGHT, I'M 51.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.834
TOO OLD FOR SUSANNA?
IS THAT IT?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.045
IN A SENSE.

07:17.354 --> 07:21.814
WALTER, IN 1947,
I WAS 58.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.440
I HAD MOST OF MY HAIR, ALL MY
TEETH AND HARDLY A VVRINKLE.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.604
LOOK AT ME NOW.

07:28.657 --> 07:33.948
IN 12 SHORT YEARS, I'VE
TURNED INTO AN OLD MAN,

07:34.037 --> 07:36.870
WHILE YOU HAVEN'T
AGED AT ALL.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.664
IT HAPPENS THAT
WAY SOMETIME.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.287
<i>I KNOW, BUT WHY?</i>

07:41.336 --> 07:46.001
DON'T ASK ME, SAM. YOU'RE THE CHEMIST.
I TEACH HISTORY.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.549
YES, AND YOU
TEACH IT VERY WELL.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.127
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE STUDENTS SAY?

07:51.221 --> 07:55.715
THEY SAY IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH YOU'D LIVED
THROUGH THE PERIOD YOU VVERE DISCUSSING.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.221
I TRY TO MAKE
IT INTERESTING.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.177
FAKE IT, YOU MEAN?

08:01.523 --> 08:03.013
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.940
YES, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.643
BUT SOMEHOW, THAT
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOU.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.108
YOU'RE SUCH
A PRECISE SORT.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.658
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

08:14.744 --> 08:17.577
<i>A BOOK OF PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN BY
A FELLOW NAMED MATHEW BRADY</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:20.531
DURING THE TIME
OF THE CIVIL WAR.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.252
<i>WELL, WHAT IS IT?</i>

08:26.339 --> 08:28.751
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.174
MAYBE I HAVE.

08:31.261 --> 08:35.255
VVALTER VVAS-VVAS YOUR GRANDFATHER
IN THE CIVIL VVAR, BY ANY CHANCE?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.885
NO.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.388
THEN I'D SAY VVE HAVE
SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY HERE.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.095
HOW SO?

08:43.188 --> 08:45.772
YOU MADE ME CURIOUS ABOUT
THIS MAJOR SKELTON TODAY.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.851
I THOUGHT IT VVOULD BE INTERESTING
TO SEE VVHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,

08:48.945 --> 08:54.031
SO I VVENT THROUGH MY BRADY PICTURES,
NOT REALLY EXPECTING TO FIND ANYTHING.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.610
THESE ARE THREE OF
SHERMAN'S STAFF OFFICERS.

08:57.704 --> 09:02.824
THE ONE SEATED AT THE TABLE IS
IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR HUGH SKELTON.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.799
<i>THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN
ALMOST 100 YEARS AGO.</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:35.272
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE KEPT THAT RING,
YOU KNOVV. IT'S A DEAD Gl\/EAVVAY.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.946
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT, SAM?

09:39.037 --> 09:41.904
OH, COME, VVALTER. YOU KNOVV
EXACTLY VVHAT I'M GETTING AT.

09:41.956 --> 09:46.166
OH, YOU'RE JOKING. JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN
TO LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY IN A PHOTOGRAPH.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.334
AND HAPPEN TO BE
VVEARING THE SAME RING

09:48.421 --> 09:52.130
AND HAPPEN TO HAVE THE SAME MOLE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR FACE.

09:54.302 --> 09:59.342
VVALTER, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
VERY CLOSE FOR 12 YEARS.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.096
TELL ME THE TRUTH. YOU--

10:03.186 --> 10:07.521
YOU ARE THAT MAN IN- IN THE
PHOTOGRAPH, AREN'T YOU?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.491
YES.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.705
[sighs]

10:27.127 --> 10:30.210
I'VE SUSPECTED
A LONG TIME.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.549
BUT IT SEEMED FANTASTIC.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.499
MM, IT IS.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.379
YES.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.304
HOW OLD ARE
YOU, WALTER?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.553
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.102
I CAN BELIEVE
ANYTHING NOW.

10:47.188 --> 10:52.058
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SAY THAT I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO HAVE KNOVVN THIS GENTLEMAN PERSONALLY.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.860
<i>PLATO?</i>

10:56.614 --> 11:00.824
BUT THAT WAS OVER
2,000 YEARS AGO!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.157
I KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.741
NO, NO, IT'S--IT
ISN'T THAT, IT'S--

11:08.835 --> 11:13.375
TWO THOUSAND YEARS.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.717
HOW, WALTER? HOW?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.758
IN HEAVEN'S NAME, THIS IS VVHAT
MANKIND HAS BEEN DREAMING OF.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.006
SAM.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.261
TELL ME THE SECRET.

11:22.348 --> 11:26.216
<i>I CAN'T TELL YOU
THE SECRET, SAM,</i>

11:26.311 --> 11:29.429
BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW IT MYSELF.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.232
I WAS LIKE YOU, SAM.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.779
AFRAID OF DEATH. AND VVHEN I THOUGHT
OF ALL THE THINGS THERE VVERE TO KNOVV

11:38.865 --> 11:42.449
IN THE MISERABLE FEVV YEARS
THAT A MAN HAD TO KNOVV THEM,

11:42.535 --> 11:46.745
IT SEEMED SENSELESS.
AT NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT

11:46.831 --> 11:50.040
I DREAMED, AS YOU DREAM,
OF IMMORTALITY.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.371
ONLY IF A MAN LIVED
FOREVER, I THOUGHT,

11:52.462 --> 11:55.295
COULD THERE BE ANY POINT
IN LIVING AT ALL?

11:55.381 --> 12:00.376
I TALKED TO PRIESTS,
PHILOSOPHERS.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.547
THEN ONE DAY
I MET AN ALCHEMIST.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.430
TOLD HIM THESE THINGS. HE SAID
THAT HE COULD GRANT MY VVISH.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.102
ONLY, OF COURSE, IT VVOULD
COST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.727
I VVAS DESPERATE, I PAID HIM HIS MONEY
AND SUBMITTED TO HIS EXPERIMENTS.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.900
I REMEMBER VERY
LITTLE ABOUT IT.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.240
I LAY IN A COMA
FOR MANY WEEKS,

12:20.281 --> 12:24.616
AND WHEN I REVIVED,
I WAS ALONE.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.818
THE ALCHEMIST
HAD DISAPPEARED.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.870
GO ON.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.120
THERE'S REALLY VERY
LITTLE MORE TO TELL.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.922
I THOUGHT, OF COURSE, THAT
THE EXPERIMENT HAD FAILED

12:39.008 --> 12:42.842
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.466
BUT THEN

12:45.556 --> 12:49.971
I SAW MY WIFE AND
MY CHILDREN AGING.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.016
<i>MY FRIENDS DYING.</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:59.773
THIS VVAS SOMETHING THAT I
HADN'T CONSIDERED, YOU SEE?

12:59.821 --> 13:03.485
BUT SURELY THERE- THERE'S
SOME ANSVVER TO THAT PROBLEM.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.703
IS THERE?
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.369
I TELL YOU THAT SOMEHOVV I
CAN STOP YOU FROM AGING.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.537
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO STOP, AT 30?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.366
THEN YOU WATCH EVERYONE
AROUND YOU GROW OLD.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.201
AT 70?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.630
DO YOU VVANT TO LIVE FOREVER
THE VVAY YOU ARE NOVV?

13:19.674 --> 13:21.665
OLD, SICK?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.375
IT'S BETTER
THAN DYING.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.177
NO, YOU'RE WRONG, SAM.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.464
I WAS WRONG.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.551
IT'S...DEATH

13:32.645 --> 13:37.139
THAT GIVES THIS
WORLD ITS POINT.

13:37.233 --> 13:42.228
VVE LOVE A ROSE BECAUSE VVE KNOVV IT'LL
SOON BE GONE. VVHO EVER LOVED A STONE?

13:46.034 --> 13:49.197
VERY OLD AND
VERY FRIGHTENED.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.402
OF WHAT, DEATH?

13:50.496 --> 13:51.907
YES, OF DEATH.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.659
YOU'RE A FOOL, SAM.
I WANT TO DIE.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.162
THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.913
BECAUSE I'M A COWARD.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.586
YOU?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.709
I HAVEN'T CHANGED.
I'M THE SAME MAN I WAS.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.917
I WAS A COWARD THEN,
I'M A COWARD NOW.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.503
I'M TIRED OF LIVING.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.678
IN MY DESK I HAVE
A REVOLVER, SAM.

14:12.727 --> 14:17.392
AND EVERY NIGHT I TAKE IT OUT AND PRAY FOR
THE COURAGE TO PULL THE TRIGGER. I CAN'T.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.190
YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU'VE
SURVIVED OVER 2,000 YEARS

14:20.276 --> 14:22.517
WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT,
WITHOUT BEING WOUNDED?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.728
SOME PEOPLE ARE
LUCKY THAT WAY.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.280
THEY GO THROUGH LIFE VVITHOUT
EVER BREAKING A BONE

14:27.367 --> 14:30.280
OR SEEING THE INSIDE
OF A HOSPITAL.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.409
OH, I'VE BEEN CLOSE
TO DEATH, MANY TIMES,

14:34.499 --> 14:38.584
BUT NEVER
CLOSE ENOUGH.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.958
THANK YOU.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.256
<i>FOR WHAT?</i>

14:45.343 --> 14:50.759
I THOUGHT IF A MAN LIVED
FOREVER, HE'D GROVV VVISER.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.964
BUT THAT ISN'T
TRUE, IS IT?

14:53.059 --> 14:56.302
YOU JUST GO ON
LIVING. THAT'S ALL.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.138
IT MUST BE LONELY.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.491
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN
MARRIED SEVERAL TIMES.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.988
YES.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.821
HOW LONG WITH EACH
WOMAN, WALTER?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.407
TEN YEARS?
FIFTEEN YEARS?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.996
I SEE.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.580
SAM, I TRIED TO RESIGN SIX MONTHS AGO. YOU
TALKED ME OUT OF IT. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.543
YES.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.001
<i>I KNEW SUSANNA WAS
FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME,</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:32.338
AND I KNEVV VVHAT VVOULD HAPPEN.
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.174
A FEVV YEARS OF
HAPPINESS AND THEN-

15:35.268 --> 15:38.977
I TRIED TO VVARN HER. I DID EVERYTHING
IN MY POVVER TO DISCOURAGE HER.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.929
EXCEPT TELL
HER THE TRUTH.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.314
HOVV COULD I DO THAT? SHE'D
HAVE THOUGHT I VVAS MAD.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.142
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU LEAVE?

15:45.236 --> 15:47.694
BECAUSE BY THEN
IT WAS TOO LATE.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.317
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.319
I NEED HER.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.199
EVERYTHING IS AGAINST IT. ALL
MY REASON AND EXPERIENCE.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.032
<i>BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.</i>

16:00.126 --> 16:05.041
IT DOES TO ME, VVALTER. I CAN'T
LET YOU MARRY MY DAUGHTER.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.838
<i>(Susanna)
AND WHY NOT?</i>

16:10.678 --> 16:12.885
WELL, COME ON.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.340
<i>YOUR FA Tl-IER SEEMS TO THINK I
7M TOO OLD FOR YOU, DARLING.</i>

16:18.019 --> 16:20.681
THAT'S THE SILLIEST
THING I EVER HEARD OF.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.478
GOOD.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.686
THEN YOU'LL
MARRY ME TONIGHT.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.562
I THINK YOU MEAN IT.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.190
I DO. YOU GO UPSTAIRS, PACK
YOUR PRETTIEST THINGS.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.989
I'LL PICK YOU UP
IN 15 MINUTES.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.900
<i>BUT--</i>

16:34.994 --> 16:37.611
GO.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.993
I'LL TELL HER.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.832
SHE WON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.168
NOBODY WOULD.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.341
YOU VVON'T BELIEVE IT YOURSELF
BY TOMORROVV MORNING.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.398

18:10.214 --> 18:13.172
<i>LOOK HARD.
LOOK INTO MY EYES.</i>

18:26.022 --> 18:29.105
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
MAKING A MISTAKE.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.522

TO SEE IF IT WAS TRUE.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.520
IT IS.

19:16.614 --> 19:20.357
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I ONLY KNOW IT'S HAPPENED.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.910
I'VE GROWN OLD,
AND YOU HAVEN'T.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.364
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
MARRY SOMEONE ELSE

19:27.458 --> 19:31.577
AND LEAVE HER,
THE WAY YOU LEFT ME.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.789
OH, LAURETTE.
