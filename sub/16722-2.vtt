00:21.407 --> 00:23.074
So, Bobby, I can't wait

00:23.075 --> 00:25.843
to see you and Linda
at my Halloween party tonight.

00:25.844 --> 00:27.245
I went all out this year.

00:27.246 --> 00:28.579
Actually, I'm taking the kids

00:28.580 --> 00:29.914
trick or treating tonight, Teddy.

00:29.915 --> 00:31.549
So, I probably can't make it.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.651
I noticed here that you,

00:33.652 --> 00:35.753
RSVP'd online
and you clicked "maybe."

00:35.754 --> 00:38.289
Right. That was kind of
a soft maybe.

00:38.323 --> 00:39.923
Maybe means maybe, Bob.
It doesn't mean

00:39.924 --> 00:41.192
"I'm too scared to say no."

00:41.226 --> 00:43.361
I got 42 maybes, Bob!

00:43.362 --> 00:45.363
Who can plan for that?

00:45.397 --> 00:46.597
There's my little candy corns.

00:46.598 --> 00:49.067
Sad Wolverine.

00:49.068 --> 00:51.502
Scary and sad.

00:51.503 --> 00:53.154
I'm Edward Scissor Hands, Mom.

00:53.188 --> 00:54.906
I'm not sure about you walking around

00:54.907 --> 00:56.374
with scissors all night, Louise.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.843
Why don't you be Edward Spoon Hands?

00:58.844 --> 01:01.512
Get real. It's Halloween.
Not Hallowuss.

01:01.547 --> 01:03.581
And Tina's a mummy.
Sexy.

01:03.582 --> 01:05.516
Last year I was a mummy.

01:05.516 --> 01:07.080
This year I'm a mommy mummy.

01:07.081 --> 01:08.681
And I'm single and I'm working two jobs,

01:08.682 --> 01:10.362
and I'm just trying to get back out there.

01:10.389 --> 01:11.749
Tina, you have to put your costume

01:11.750 --> 01:13.207
back on the roll tomorrow.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.709
I'm not losing that much TP.
Okay.

01:15.928 --> 01:17.862
And Gene looks great, too.

01:17.863 --> 01:19.197
Wait, what are you, hon?

01:19.198 --> 01:21.065
I'm rapper/actress Queen Latifah

01:21.066 --> 01:22.567
from her U.N.I.T.Y. phase.

01:22.601 --> 01:24.435
God, so specific and political.

01:24.436 --> 01:25.628
I love it.

01:26.939 --> 01:28.459
All right, kids, help me close up shop

01:28.460 --> 01:29.900
and we can all go trick or treating.

01:29.908 --> 01:31.609
Dad, we've decided that this year

01:31.610 --> 01:33.678
we'd like to go trick or treating alone.

01:33.712 --> 01:35.880
Alone?
We're born alone, we die alone,

01:35.881 --> 01:37.782
and in between we trick or treat alone.

01:37.816 --> 01:39.616
But you kids love trick
or treating with me.

01:39.617 --> 01:40.918
That's the best part.

01:40.953 --> 01:42.754
Yeah, that's the best part
: Yeah,

01:42.755 --> 01:44.789
that's the best part.
Shush, shush.

01:44.823 --> 01:47.125
I, I don't know. I mean,
it's, it's Halloween.

01:47.126 --> 01:49.393
You know, things can get
a little weird out there.

01:49.394 --> 01:51.629
Just let 'em go,
Bobby. C'mon.

01:51.631 --> 01:53.038
Fine. You can

01:53.039 --> 01:54.599
trick or treat by yourselves this year.

01:55.901 --> 01:57.802
But you stick to o regular route

01:57.803 --> 01:59.904
and I want you home by 9:00.
Hooray!

01:59.938 --> 02:01.506
You can come to my party.

02:01.507 --> 02:03.191
Right, great.

02:03.192 --> 02:04.425
Yay!

02:06.979 --> 02:10.256
I wa this to be the sugar high
I never come down from.

02:13.001 --> 02:14.635
Okay, bad start.
Bad start.

02:14.670 --> 02:15.820
Let's keep moving.

02:15.821 --> 02:16.988
Trick or treat.

02:16.989 --> 02:18.356
Here's some oyster crackers.

02:18.357 --> 02:19.857
Now get out of here.

02:19.858 --> 02:20.925
Trick or treat.

02:20.959 --> 02:22.293
Is it Halloween?

02:22.294 --> 02:23.878
Here, take some deli numbe.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.830
You'll be the first in line tomorrow.

02:25.831 --> 02:27.165
Trick or treat.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.666
Some delicious seaweed candy

02:28.667 --> 02:31.169
from my solo vacation in Singapore.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.537
Wrap it up, Charles Dickens.

02:32.538 --> 02:34.205
You're not being paid by the word.

02:34.206 --> 02:35.807
♪ I was walking
in the graveya... ♪

02:35.841 --> 02:37.308
Bobby.

02:37.342 --> 02:39.343
- Linda.
- Hi, Teddy.

02:39.378 --> 02:41.145
Welcome to my Black and Orange party.

02:41.146 --> 02:43.281
Teddy, you really went all out.

02:43.315 --> 02:44.955
I spray-painted
everything this morning.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.150
Yeah, it's aittle strong.

02:46.151 --> 02:47.318
Maybe we should open a window

02:47.352 --> 02:49.169
or something.
Yeah, I would,

02:49.170 --> 02:50.471
but they're painted shut.

02:50.472 --> 02:52.056
Can I offer you
a hard-boiled egg?

02:52.057 --> 02:53.937
I colored them black
and orange with a marker.

02:53.938 --> 02:55.342
Whoa. Whoa. Hey.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.345
What was that?

02:57.346 --> 02:59.347
No need to be scared, everybody.

02:59.348 --> 03:02.149
Just my guinea pig, Francis.
You can call her Frankie.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.552
But just don't call her Fran.
She hates that.

03:04.553 --> 03:05.987
What about Francy pants?

03:05.988 --> 03:08.022
Saint Francis pants,

03:08.023 --> 03:09.590
What's wrong with you?
What?

03:09.591 --> 03:11.492
Hey, you're not wearing a costume, Bob.

03:11.493 --> 03:13.413
I just didn't think
I needed to wear a costume.

03:13.414 --> 03:14.662
It's not a kids' party.

03:14.696 --> 03:16.196
Hey, everybody, we've got

03:16.197 --> 03:18.399
a party violation over here.
What are you doing?

03:18.433 --> 03:20.501
Bob is not wearing a costume.
Mike the mailman's

03:20.502 --> 03:22.470
not wearing a costume.
Mike's a bunny.

03:22.504 --> 03:24.405
He's not a bunny.
I'm a bunny.

03:24.406 --> 03:25.706
You have a cotton ball.

03:25.707 --> 03:27.542
He has a cotton ball.
On your uniform.

03:27.543 --> 03:29.043
It's a great idea.

03:29.044 --> 03:31.312
Now we're gonna get
you to the costume closet.

03:31.346 --> 03:32.713
♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba ♪

03:32.714 --> 03:34.682
We got some sort of Chewbacca.
No.

03:34.683 --> 03:36.167
The sun.
No.

03:36.168 --> 03:37.808
Summer Frankenstein.
That's not a thing.

03:37.809 --> 03:39.337
And,

03:39.371 --> 03:41.906
I think we got a winner here.
No, no, no.

03:43.609 --> 03:44.842
There, all better.

03:44.843 --> 03:46.777
Now, you don't look so ridiculous.

03:46.778 --> 03:50.781
I'll trade you two packets of
hot sauce for a fortune cookie.

03:50.782 --> 03:52.622
Throw in some cough drops
and you got a deal.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.618
Sold.

03:53.619 --> 03:55.753
This town is horrible at Halloween.

03:55.754 --> 03:57.405
We're trick or treating by ourselves

03:57.406 --> 04:00.441
for the first time ever;
we need to get some real candy.

04:00.442 --> 04:02.043
Follow me.

04:02.044 --> 04:03.377
I know where we can go.

04:03.378 --> 04:05.245
We're going where the rich people live.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.247
Rich people are better at Halloween.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.649
And skin care.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.551
That's why we're going to...

04:10.552 --> 04:11.886
Kingshead Island.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.576
I should have worn more toilet paper.

04:18.577 --> 04:21.312
Okay, okay I admit it's a little colder

04:21.313 --> 04:22.546
than I thought it would be.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.433
I don't wanna die.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.794
I'm not wearing my good underpants

04:27.795 --> 04:29.070
and I'd be so embarrassed.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.575
Did it just get ten degrees warmer?

04:34.576 --> 04:36.577
I think that seagull just winked at me.

04:36.578 --> 04:37.945
Hello.

04:37.946 --> 04:39.664
Kingshead Island, nice to meet ya.

04:39.665 --> 04:41.448
Now, l trick or treat ya.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.409
Wow, look how clean it is.

04:49.410 --> 04:50.927
I could drink from the puddles.

04:50.928 --> 04:52.445
I'm going to.

04:52.446 --> 04:53.797
Hey, guys.
Sweet 'tumes.

04:53.798 --> 04:54.898
Costumes.

04:54.899 --> 04:56.633
Edward Scissor Hands, cool.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.535
Queen Latifah, also cool.

04:58.536 --> 05:00.136
Finally, somebody gets it.

05:00.137 --> 05:01.771
Toilet paper roll.
Nailed it.

05:01.772 --> 05:03.006
Mummy.

05:03.007 --> 05:04.624
Hey, I'm Milo.
I'm Ned.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.510
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that all candy?

05:07.511 --> 05:09.779
Yeah, we already dropped
one bag off at home.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.460
Now, we're gonna head down Spencer Street.

05:11.461 --> 05:12.941
That's where all the good houses are.

05:12.942 --> 05:14.501
Funny coincidence.

05:14.502 --> 05:16.770
We were also gonna go down Spencer Street.

05:16.804 --> 05:18.004
Well, great.

05:18.005 --> 05:19.556
I'm gonna eat like a Queen.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.858
Come on, Lin, Teddy went to the bathroom.

05:21.859 --> 05:23.593
Now's our chance.
Let's sneak out of here.

05:23.594 --> 05:24.961
But you look so cute.

05:24.962 --> 05:27.130
I wanna spank the cake
right out of your face.

05:27.131 --> 05:29.432
No.
Come on.

05:31.669 --> 05:33.269
My God, my God.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.704
Somebody stepped on Francis.

05:34.705 --> 05:36.272
My God, my God.

05:36.307 --> 05:38.708
She's not breathing.
She's not breathing.

05:41.212 --> 05:42.612
Live, damn it, live.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.114
Teddy, let me try.

05:44.115 --> 05:45.382
I have good lungs.

05:52.573 --> 05:53.907
Somebody do something.

05:53.908 --> 05:55.525
Mike, do something.

05:55.526 --> 05:56.566
What do you want me to do?

05:56.567 --> 05:57.560
I'm a mailman.

05:57.561 --> 05:59.646
Mike's a mailman!

05:59.647 --> 06:01.347
God.

06:01.365 --> 06:03.133
Come on, move those legs, Francis.

06:03.134 --> 06:04.567
Move those legs.

06:04.568 --> 06:06.169
I saw it. I saw it move.
Move those...

06:06.170 --> 06:07.137
She's alive.
Come on.

06:07.171 --> 06:08.772
No, she's dead.

06:08.806 --> 06:10.373
No, she's dead.

06:10.374 --> 06:12.175
Somebody stepped on Francis.

06:12.176 --> 06:14.711
And then did nothing.
Nothing!

06:14.712 --> 06:16.592
Teddy, how do you know
someone stepped on her?

06:16.593 --> 06:18.815
Guinea pigs aren't flat,

06:18.816 --> 06:20.984
they don't just look like this in the wild.

06:21.018 --> 06:24.187
All right, well, we're gonna go.

06:24.188 --> 06:25.355
Lin, get your stuff.

06:25.356 --> 06:27.557
Yup, yup, yup.
Great party.

06:27.558 --> 06:30.360
Seriously, I hope that, Francis comes...

06:30.361 --> 06:31.350
is... gets better.

06:31.378 --> 06:32.679
No, you don't.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.980
What? What?
Nobody's leaving.

06:34.014 --> 06:36.683
The killer is inside this room.

06:36.684 --> 06:38.485
No one leaves until I find him

06:38.519 --> 06:39.619
or her.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.721
Sorry I'm late.

06:41.722 --> 06:43.523
Whoa, who died?

06:44.792 --> 06:46.025
Trick or treat.

06:46.026 --> 06:47.727
You kids look great.

06:47.728 --> 06:51.264
Here ya go, one for you.
Here ya are.

06:51.265 --> 06:52.632
Africa.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.901
Hey, is Bill puking in my bidet again?

06:54.935 --> 06:56.603
Full bars?

06:56.604 --> 06:58.204
Full bars?
Full bars!

06:58.205 --> 07:01.090
She just gave us
full-sized chocolate bars.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.425
Does she know?

07:02.426 --> 07:04.077
My God, was it an accident?!

07:04.078 --> 07:05.278
What just happened?

07:05.279 --> 07:07.096
How does this not topple your economy?

07:07.097 --> 07:09.582
Everything I knew to be true
just went out the window.

07:21.912 --> 07:24.614
The Wagners are on vacation
in St. Bart's.

07:24.615 --> 07:25.882
You know what, good for them.

07:25.883 --> 07:28.551
Those Wagners were
looking run-down.

07:28.552 --> 07:29.552
Please, take one.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.723
What happens when you take two?

07:33.724 --> 07:35.558
It got me. Help!

07:35.559 --> 07:37.594
Wait a minute.
Nothing happens.

07:37.595 --> 07:39.796
I'll take three.
Thanks, Wagner family.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.298
Have fun at church
or whatever St. Bart's is.

07:42.299 --> 07:43.633
It's got my hand.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.134
Just kidding.

07:45.135 --> 07:46.753
It was funnier when Louise did it.

07:46.754 --> 07:49.022
Ma'am, I'm speaking now.

07:49.023 --> 07:50.790
I let you speak.
Now let me speak.

07:50.824 --> 07:53.409
You don't tell me when to call 911.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.011
The police aren't coming.

07:55.012 --> 07:57.530
Looks like I have to do
this investigation myself.

07:57.531 --> 07:58.891
Teddy, I really don't think anyone

07:58.892 --> 08:01.184
at your party purposely killed Francis.

08:01.185 --> 08:04.771
Every man is capable of murder
if he's pushed far enough.

08:04.772 --> 08:06.339
Even you, Bob.

08:06.373 --> 08:08.274
You've been stewing
in the corner all night.

08:08.309 --> 08:09.669
What are you talking about, Teddy?

08:09.670 --> 08:11.544
You can get a little testy, Bob.

08:11.545 --> 08:13.505
Don't buy him a V-neck T-shirt,
whatever you do.

08:13.506 --> 08:14.447
He goes berserk.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.148
You're not in the clear either, Linda.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.501
You couldn't share the spotlight
with Francis, could you?

08:18.502 --> 08:19.669
You had to stomp her out.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.170
Don't accuse me, Teddy.

08:21.171 --> 08:22.372
You're the spouse.

08:22.373 --> 08:24.107
It's always the spouse.

08:24.108 --> 08:25.975
Passion of m-m-murder passion.

08:26.010 --> 08:27.644
Teddy, you're going crazy.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.525
I mean, you're kind
of ruining your own party.

08:29.526 --> 08:31.748
Or did Dennis ruin my party?

08:31.782 --> 08:33.283
By killing Francis.

08:33.317 --> 08:34.784
I didn't kill your freaking rat.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.285
Maybe you didn't, Dennis.

08:36.287 --> 08:39.054
But I know you get dirty massages.
Whoa.

08:39.056 --> 08:40.856
And let's not forget
about Mike the Mailman.

08:40.857 --> 08:42.058
Me? What about me?

08:42.058 --> 08:44.294
It's your walk.
Your menacing walk.

08:44.295 --> 08:46.029
Slamming your feet all over town.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.096
Left, right,

08:47.131 --> 08:48.131
Kill, kill.

08:48.165 --> 08:49.365
It's a limp, Teddy.

08:49.366 --> 08:50.967
You know Mike has uneven legs.

08:50.968 --> 08:52.635
It's why I wear my special shoes.

08:52.670 --> 08:55.204
Don't you mean murder weapons?
Yeah, you know what?

08:55.239 --> 08:59.342
I actually wanna see everyone's
potential murder weapons.

08:59.343 --> 09:01.911
Yeah, shoes in the chip bowl, now.

09:01.912 --> 09:03.179
Aww, those were good chips.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.480
Yeah, they were, Linda!

09:04.481 --> 09:05.682
They were good chips!

09:05.683 --> 09:07.283
Okay, guys.

09:07.318 --> 09:08.551
It's getting pretty late.

09:08.552 --> 09:09.652
Better get off the streets,

09:09.653 --> 09:11.020
We're pushing it a little.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.589
Don't you think?
Yeah.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.557
What do you mean?
We're just getting started.

09:14.558 --> 09:16.526
There's a whole other street
here full of sugar

09:16.527 --> 09:18.828
just waiting to course through our veins.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.096
Hell Hunt.

09:20.097 --> 09:21.714
What does that mean?

09:21.715 --> 09:24.517
Yeah, why did you
just whisper "Hell Hunt?"

09:24.518 --> 09:26.853
You guys don't know about Hell Hunt?

09:26.854 --> 09:28.534
You're not from Kingshead Island, are you?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.779
We come from the mainland:
America.

09:30.791 --> 09:33.409
Every Halloween, after
all the parents get drunk,

09:33.410 --> 09:37.229
the teenagers come out
and they go freaking crazy.

09:37.230 --> 09:39.949
They ride around town on their
bikes, vandalize stuff,

09:39.950 --> 09:41.901
and if any little kids are still out,

09:41.902 --> 09:44.771
I heard they...
I heard they...

09:44.772 --> 09:45.972
I heard they,

09:45.973 --> 09:47.040
- They...
- Say it.

09:47.041 --> 09:48.391
I heard they shave your head.

09:48.425 --> 09:51.794
I heard they throw balloons full of pee.

09:51.795 --> 09:54.430
Three years ago my brother's
friend stayed out too late

09:54.431 --> 09:57.100
and he came home covered in
syrup without any eyebrows.

09:57.134 --> 09:59.202
Yeah, I don't know about all this.

09:59.203 --> 10:00.937
That's a lot of different stories.

10:00.938 --> 10:02.038
I like syrup.

10:02.039 --> 10:03.439
Look, it's not safe.

10:03.474 --> 10:04.974
We've got to get indoors.

10:04.975 --> 10:06.455
And you guys need to get to the dock.

10:06.456 --> 10:07.977
Cool tip, Milo.

10:07.978 --> 10:09.778
Come on, guys.
Let's go get some more candy.

10:09.779 --> 10:11.114
What was that?
What?

10:11.115 --> 10:12.448
Did you hear that?
No.

10:13.751 --> 10:16.619
Hell Hunt! Hide!

10:16.654 --> 10:19.906
Kids, come out and play.

10:34.903 --> 10:35.953
Hey, Wade Boggs,

10:35.987 --> 10:37.321
do you like eggs?

10:37.339 --> 10:38.840
How do you like these eggs?!

10:38.841 --> 10:40.308
I don't like 'em!

10:40.342 --> 10:41.843
Please don't cry.
Please don't cry.

10:41.844 --> 10:43.344
Quick question.

10:43.345 --> 10:46.881
Does anyone here know how
to get back to the ferry?

10:49.084 --> 10:51.252
- Hey, Amanda!
- Hey, Bryce. What's up?

10:51.286 --> 10:52.754
Not much.

10:52.755 --> 10:54.275
Just, hanging out
with my... budsies.

10:54.289 --> 10:56.007
I remember when I was a sophomore.

10:56.008 --> 10:57.442
Hell Hunt's so lame.

10:57.476 --> 10:59.110
Yeah. I mean, it's like...

10:59.111 --> 11:00.611
grow up, right?

11:00.646 --> 11:02.000
I guess it's cool

11:02.001 --> 11:03.881
you guys are keeping up
the tradition, though.

11:03.882 --> 11:05.950
Totally.
Yeah, Hell Hunt's the best.

11:05.951 --> 11:07.485
So are you.

11:07.486 --> 11:08.851
What?
That's your car

11:08.852 --> 11:10.972
that you're driving?
That's your car that you drive?

11:10.973 --> 11:12.440
This guy is dying out there.

11:12.441 --> 11:14.041
He just needs to be himself.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.244
No. He should pretend
to be someone else.

11:16.278 --> 11:17.712
What the freak was that?
What?

11:17.713 --> 11:19.147
I-I thought I heard something.

11:19.148 --> 11:20.915
I got 20-20 hearing. Anyway,

11:20.949 --> 11:23.634
you should cruise by my lacrosse game.
No thanks!

11:23.669 --> 11:25.136
Bye!
Bye.

11:25.137 --> 11:26.571
There's one! Geesh!

11:26.572 --> 11:28.723
Goosh!

11:30.292 --> 11:32.160
Let's go.

11:32.194 --> 11:34.378
Where are we?
I think it's a country club.

11:34.396 --> 11:37.431
It's like a huge miniature golf course.

11:37.466 --> 11:39.183
The windmills are gonna be enormous.

11:39.184 --> 11:40.551
Look. I see a light.

11:40.586 --> 11:41.919
Maybe that's the docks!

11:44.590 --> 11:46.491
Tennis courts?

11:46.492 --> 11:48.893
I don't think
those kids are playing tennis.

11:48.894 --> 11:50.845
Or they're playing it very wrong.

11:52.314 --> 11:54.315
They all kind of fit.

11:54.316 --> 11:56.584
Like she got stomped a couple of times.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.219
Can I have my shoes back now?

11:58.220 --> 12:00.188
I'm the only one here with uneven legs.

12:00.189 --> 12:01.589
Quit milking that leg, Wobbles.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.057
Whoa, that's not funny, Teddy.

12:03.058 --> 12:04.725
It's okay.
It's my last name.

12:04.726 --> 12:07.178
Fine, you can have your left one back!
Thank you.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.514
Maybe we should ask <i>Francis</i> who killed her?

12:09.548 --> 12:11.048
Are you mocking me, Gretchen?

12:11.083 --> 12:12.850
No. I'm a medium, Teddy.

12:12.851 --> 12:14.285
I can talk to dead animals.

12:14.286 --> 12:15.920
Mort, your toupee says hi.

12:15.921 --> 12:17.288
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!

12:17.289 --> 12:18.923
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Good joke!

12:18.924 --> 12:21.392
She's pretending I wear
a toupee. So funny.

12:21.393 --> 12:22.860
Okay, we're leaving now.

12:22.861 --> 12:25.029
Maybe I can still catch up with the kids.

12:25.030 --> 12:26.898
But Gretchen's onto something.

12:28.266 --> 12:29.800
Lin, she's just drunk.
Let's go

12:29.801 --> 12:31.853
before she asks us for a ride home.

12:33.956 --> 12:36.023
Bobby! Psst.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

12:36.024 --> 12:37.692
What? What is it?

12:37.693 --> 12:40.261
You have fur on the back of your costume, Bob.
What?

12:40.262 --> 12:42.446
And tiny little
scratch marks. God!

12:42.447 --> 12:44.048
God. I ki...

12:44.049 --> 12:46.434
: ...killed Francis.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.639
Psst! Milo?!
I'm so glad you guys are here.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.207
They're gonna
pee-balloon us

12:53.242 --> 12:54.675
any minute now.

12:54.710 --> 12:56.477
Yeah, we're glad we're here, too.

12:56.478 --> 12:57.912
So, uhyeah, you know what?

12:57.913 --> 12:59.380
This just came to mind.

12:59.381 --> 13:01.015
<i>How</i> do you get to the ferry?

13:01.049 --> 13:03.751
Okay, just follow this road down the hill

13:03.752 --> 13:05.453
and turn right at the stop sign.

13:05.454 --> 13:07.321
Now help us break out of here!

13:07.322 --> 13:08.756
There's kids loose!

13:08.757 --> 13:09.724
Let's get 'em!

13:09.758 --> 13:11.108
Run!

13:14.079 --> 13:15.663
You're in trouble!

13:15.664 --> 13:17.348
- Get it?!
- Yes!

13:17.349 --> 13:18.766
You can't outrun number one!

13:18.767 --> 13:20.150
Yes, we can!

13:21.620 --> 13:23.421
Three, please.

13:23.455 --> 13:25.423
Let's get off this godforsaken island

13:25.424 --> 13:27.458
and back to the armpit we call home.

13:27.459 --> 13:29.961
I can't wait to be back in my own house,

13:29.962 --> 13:32.096
in my own pajamas, in my own Dutch oven.

13:32.097 --> 13:33.497
So long, island!

13:35.934 --> 13:38.469
Those kids are really getting it.

13:38.470 --> 13:39.870
I remember Hell Hunt.

13:39.871 --> 13:41.606
Still can't stand the sight of eggs.

13:41.607 --> 13:43.007
Won't eat 'em, won't touch 'em.

13:43.008 --> 13:44.675
What about a nice egg salad?

13:44.676 --> 13:46.377
No more egg talk!
<i>Yes,</i> more egg talk!

13:46.378 --> 13:47.845
Eggs!

13:47.846 --> 13:50.014
Let's go, Gene!

13:51.183 --> 13:52.850
Tina, come on!

13:52.851 --> 13:55.886
But Milo and Ned are back there,
and they need us.

13:57.155 --> 13:58.723
Do they, though?

13:58.724 --> 14:00.858
Tina, this isn't our fight!

14:00.859 --> 14:03.227
Do you really want to stay
here and get pee-ballooned?

14:03.228 --> 14:06.247
Yeah. I can pee on myself.
I don't need any handouts.

14:06.298 --> 14:09.533
Listen, this town gave us
the best candy we've ever seen.

14:09.534 --> 14:11.135
We owe it to them to go back.

14:11.136 --> 14:14.071
Great. Now my candy
tastes like guilt!

14:14.072 --> 14:15.890
Fine!

14:15.891 --> 14:19.343
We'll go back and save
Milo and what's-his-face,

14:19.344 --> 14:21.746
but I get to slap Gene.
That's fair.

14:21.747 --> 14:24.665
I banish you from the land of Latifah!

14:28.865 --> 14:32.335
Okay, so all we have to do is
sneak up to the tennis courts,

14:32.336 --> 14:34.203
take out the guy guarding the gate,

14:34.204 --> 14:36.672
fight off four teenagers and free the kids.

14:36.673 --> 14:38.107
I zoned out.
Say that again.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.710
We just need some kind of distraction.

14:42.879 --> 14:44.246
I'll be right there.

14:44.281 --> 14:46.849
I'm just stopping to
get gum and some t-pons.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.087
Distraction located.

14:51.121 --> 14:54.407
All right, who wants
the first pee balloon? You?

14:54.408 --> 14:56.325
No. You?
No.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.760
And... send.

15:00.731 --> 15:03.199
Hell, yeah.
I just got a text from Amanda.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.036
"Pool party at the Wagner house
with me and the girls!"

15:07.037 --> 15:08.904
What? That's awesome!

15:08.905 --> 15:11.107
It's kind of cold to go pool hopping.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.377
"The Wagner's pool is not cold."

15:14.378 --> 15:16.479
That's weird.
Okay, let's go!

15:16.480 --> 15:18.547
What about Hell Hunt?
Are you crazy?

15:18.548 --> 15:20.216
These girls are seniors.

15:20.217 --> 15:22.084
I heard Amanda's got a belly button ring.

15:22.085 --> 15:24.887
Well, I heard she can tie
a cherry stem with her butt!

15:24.888 --> 15:27.123
I heard she has to special order her bras!

15:27.157 --> 15:28.958
This thing is like a remote control.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.559
They'll do whatever I say.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.328
Tell them to push their butts together.

15:32.329 --> 15:33.763
Give them French accents.

15:33.797 --> 15:35.231
She says hurry.

15:35.232 --> 15:36.872
And that we're really cute when we hurry.

15:36.873 --> 15:39.602
Hey, get all your farts
out now before we get there.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.611
Help! Help!
Let us out of here!

15:48.612 --> 15:50.312
Help!

15:50.313 --> 15:52.782
Queen Latifah, give me strength!

15:56.787 --> 15:58.587
Thanks, guys.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.589
Thank you.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.259
I'm not a big fan of pee, right, Ned?

16:03.260 --> 16:05.428
Well, we've got a boat to catch.

16:05.429 --> 16:08.134
Hold on.
I'm not done with this yet.

16:10.150 --> 16:12.785
These teens messed
with the wrong kids... us.

16:15.022 --> 16:16.455
"Sorry we are late.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.657
"We are getting our boobs ready.

16:18.658 --> 16:20.393
"You boyz go skinny-dipping.

16:20.427 --> 16:21.994
C U soon to skinny-dip."

16:21.995 --> 16:23.529
All right, let's pop off our pants.

16:27.467 --> 16:29.268
There's a lot of carrots in that stew.

16:29.302 --> 16:31.337
This is awesome!
We're skinny-dipping!

16:31.338 --> 16:33.639
It's gonna be even better
with girls, I bet!

16:33.673 --> 16:35.141
Okay, let's get to the ferry.

16:35.142 --> 16:36.976
This candy's not gonna eat itself.

16:36.977 --> 16:39.612
We should steal their clothes
and throw them in the ocean.

16:39.613 --> 16:41.347
Or we could take pictures of them,

16:41.348 --> 16:43.215
and then later, we can look at them.

16:43.216 --> 16:44.550
That would show them!

16:44.551 --> 16:46.035
Fine, I'm gonna get started.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.304
Chocolate, caramel, lollipop, hot sauce.

16:48.305 --> 16:49.805
Yes! That's it!

16:49.806 --> 16:51.741
Let's put hot sauce in their underwear!

16:51.742 --> 16:53.676
Does that even do anything?

16:53.677 --> 16:56.378
Yeah, if there's one thing a
wiener hates, it's hot sauce.

16:56.379 --> 16:57.847
I learned that the hard way.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.648
Mmm. Taco on the toilet.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.217
Why doesn't everybody do this?

17:02.686 --> 17:06.155
11 years old and still learning every day.

17:06.156 --> 17:13.529
♪ And that's amazing grace. ♪

17:13.563 --> 17:16.098
Who would like
to pay tribute to Francis? Mike?

17:16.098 --> 17:18.200
Every time I delivered mail to Teddy,

17:18.201 --> 17:20.069
Francis greeted me with a friendly...

17:20.069 --> 17:22.538

17:22.539 --> 17:24.205
Something like that.

17:24.207 --> 17:26.675
What do I do? Teddy's gonna
kill me for killing Francis.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.042
You got to tell him.

17:28.078 --> 17:29.945
A guinea pig.
What is it?

17:29.946 --> 17:31.580
Anyway, I'm Dennis.

17:31.581 --> 17:34.850
Thank you guys.
That was beautiful. Bob,

17:34.851 --> 17:36.251
do you want to say anything?

17:36.252 --> 17:39.271
Yes.
Francis was a great animal.

17:39.272 --> 17:42.892
She went through her life
with such poise...

17:42.893 --> 17:46.612
I can't do this.
Teddy, I killed Francis.

17:46.613 --> 17:48.464
What?!
I-I didn't even know I did it!

17:48.465 --> 17:50.633
I couldn't feel her underneath
this stupid fat suit

17:50.634 --> 17:52.234
that you made me wear!

17:53.904 --> 17:57.706
God.

17:57.707 --> 18:00.209
Damn it.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.311
You could have been summer Frankenstein.

18:02.312 --> 18:05.147
Summer Frankenstein
wasn't good enough for you.

18:05.148 --> 18:06.615
I'm really sorry, Teddy.

18:06.616 --> 18:09.084
She gave me the best 14 years of my life.

18:09.085 --> 18:10.886
Wait. She was
14 years old?

18:10.887 --> 18:12.421
How long do they usually live?

18:12.422 --> 18:14.290
I don't know.
Three to five years.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.759
She was a 154 in guinea pig years.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.427
You probably shouldn't have painted her

18:18.428 --> 18:19.829
black and orange, man.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.597
Yeah, she got real dizzy.

18:21.598 --> 18:23.265
She kept trying to eat her paw.

18:23.266 --> 18:25.634
Wait. Why would you spray-paint
your guinea pig, Teddy?

18:25.635 --> 18:27.837
For the party, 'cause
it went with everything.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.572
I know... Lin, I know that.

18:29.573 --> 18:31.240
But why, Teddy, would you do that?

18:31.241 --> 18:32.575
It's pretty stupid.

18:32.576 --> 18:34.176
I got caught up in the party.

18:34.177 --> 18:36.679
Okay, Bob.
We both killed her.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.180
Fair enough.

18:38.181 --> 18:40.249
Well, now I can
get a ferret. Anyway,

18:40.250 --> 18:41.617
thanks for coming, everybody.

18:41.618 --> 18:43.185
Sorry I called you all murderers.

18:43.186 --> 18:45.287
If anyone wants me to burn them a copy

18:45.288 --> 18:47.623
of this <i>Spooky Sounds</i> CD, just let me know.

18:49.492 --> 18:51.092
They're not coming.
I'm getting pruney.

18:51.093 --> 18:52.678
Let's get out of here.

18:52.679 --> 18:54.113
Chill out with your dills out, man.

18:54.114 --> 18:55.915
Don't be lame.
I'll call her.

18:57.834 --> 18:58.634
What the...?

18:58.668 --> 19:00.936
Hey!

19:00.937 --> 19:02.771
Bye!

19:05.025 --> 19:07.109
I should have just taken one!

19:07.110 --> 19:10.279
Those full bars are weighing me down!

19:14.434 --> 19:17.352
<i>No!</i>

19:17.353 --> 19:18.654
Louise?

19:18.688 --> 19:20.568
How many pairs of underwear
did you hot sauce?

19:20.569 --> 19:22.992
Only one of them...
wore underwear!

19:26.713 --> 19:28.196
You are dead!

19:28.197 --> 19:30.165
My baby!

19:30.166 --> 19:32.167
Come here!

19:34.187 --> 19:35.955
Our pee!
Ew!

19:35.989 --> 19:38.023
And so,

19:38.058 --> 19:40.709
the hell hunters become...
the ones

19:40.710 --> 19:42.628
who are being hell-huntered.

19:42.629 --> 19:44.830
Well put.
Thanks, guys.

19:44.864 --> 19:46.665
Mess 'em up!
Bye, Milo.

19:46.666 --> 19:48.133
Bye, Milo's friend.

19:48.134 --> 19:49.734
We'll probably come back next Halloween.

19:49.735 --> 19:50.853
No, we won't!

19:50.854 --> 19:53.188
Yes!
No!

19:53.189 --> 19:55.708
Gross. Have you guys
seen my phone?

19:55.709 --> 19:57.409
Geesh!
Actually some kid...

19:57.410 --> 19:58.978
I'm getting hit with...
Forget it.

19:58.979 --> 20:01.196
- Bye!
- Yes! Yes!

20:08.605 --> 20:10.572
So close!

20:12.108 --> 20:13.842
No fair.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.444
I lost all my full bars.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.046
You can lick my wrappers.

20:17.047 --> 20:18.714
Or I can <i>eat</i> your wrappers!

20:18.715 --> 20:20.416
Nothing will ever replace my baby,

20:20.417 --> 20:23.052
but these full bars
are coming pretty close.

20:23.053 --> 20:24.920
There's my little cavities!

20:24.955 --> 20:27.022
Yeah, how was your first
Halloween without me?

20:27.023 --> 20:28.524
Pretty boring, I bet.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.427
Your father killed a guinea pig!

20:31.428 --> 20:32.728
He squashed it with...
Lin!

20:32.762 --> 20:34.196
Tell us about that!

20:34.197 --> 20:35.564
Was it in self-defense?

20:35.565 --> 20:36.865
Did he disrespect your woman?

20:36.866 --> 20:38.928
No. I just...
rolled on to him.

20:38.929 --> 20:40.429
Yay! Yay!
Yeah!

20:40.430 --> 20:42.370
Here's what happened.

20:42.371 --> 20:46.206
It was a dark and spooky night.
I knew it!
