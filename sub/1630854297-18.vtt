WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:08.270
(Vivaldi's "Concerto No. 1
in E Major" playing)

00:12.180 --> 00:13.160
And now,

00:13.360 --> 00:15.760
for the first time ever,

00:15.960 --> 00:18.130
introducing Mr. and Mrs.

00:18.330 --> 00:21.430
John DiPierro.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.170
(cheering, applause)

00:23.370 --> 00:25.870
* When the moon hits your eye *

00:26.070 --> 00:27.440
* Like a big pizza pie *

00:27.640 --> 00:30.240
* That's amore... *

00:30.440 --> 00:32.250
(gasps) My dress!

00:32.450 --> 00:33.550
My dress!

00:33.750 --> 00:34.960
What are you,
an idiot?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.420
Apologize...
(clamoring)

00:37.620 --> 00:40.020
* That's amore... *

00:40.220 --> 00:42.390
Hey!
What're you doing?

00:42.590 --> 00:45.460
* When the stars *

00:45.660 --> 00:46.430
* Make you drool... *

00:46.630 --> 00:47.960
(clamoring)

00:48.160 --> 00:50.000
MAN:
Hey. Hey. Whoa!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.230
* That's amore... *

00:51.430 --> 00:53.230
(clamoring continues)

00:53.430 --> 00:55.470
* When you dance
down the street *

00:55.670 --> 00:57.570
* With a cloud at your feet *

00:57.770 --> 00:58.940
MAN:
Come on, Anthony, hit him.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.890
* You're in love *

01:02.360 --> 01:03.340
(grunting)

01:03.540 --> 01:08.710
* When you walk in a dream *

01:08.910 --> 01:14.490
* But you know
you're not dreaming *

01:14.690 --> 01:16.660
* Signore... *

01:16.860 --> 01:18.090
Carmine!

01:18.290 --> 01:19.790
Pick him up.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.090
(grunts)

01:21.290 --> 01:22.230
(both scream)

01:22.430 --> 01:23.230
* Back in old Napoli *

01:23.430 --> 01:26.100
* That's amore *

01:26.300 --> 01:27.430
(both scream)

01:27.630 --> 01:29.340
* Amore *

01:29.540 --> 01:32.990
* That's amore. *

01:33.860 --> 01:36.240
You got to be kidding me.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.640
You punk!

01:37.840 --> 01:40.180
You son of a bitch! Why?!

01:40.380 --> 01:41.480
Hey. Police!
Don't move.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.720
Why?
It took you guys long enough.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.550
This dude's
out of his mind.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.520
Shut up.
This punk

01:47.720 --> 01:49.660
sold my grandson pills

01:49.860 --> 01:51.420
that were laced
with fentanyl.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.160
I want you to arrest him
right now.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.530
Okay, we could talk about that,

01:55.730 --> 01:56.960
but first, you got to
put down that gun.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.760
I don't even know
what he's talking about.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.700
Will you shoot him already?
SAM: Ah, God, shut up!

02:00.900 --> 02:01.930
I've got proof

02:02.130 --> 02:04.400
that he sold the drugs.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.900
Sir, drop
your weapon now.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.540
But if you don't come right now,
I'm gonna finish it.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.610
We're gonna arrest him.
We're gonna arrest him,

02:10.810 --> 02:12.760
but first, you got to
give me this gun.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.500
Scum.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.690
Hands behind
your back.

02:22.890 --> 02:24.560
What the hell?
I-I didn't do anything.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.090
Just go with it.
Trying to save your life.

02:27.290 --> 02:28.730
Thank you.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.230
Thank you, Officer.
Yeah.

02:31.430 --> 02:32.830
Are you out of your mind?

02:33.030 --> 02:34.930
I...
You just held him at gunpoint,

02:35.130 --> 02:37.200
and that's against the law. Oh.
SAM: I know the law.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.590
I'm a retired cop.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.180
Sergeant
Sam Velucci.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.150
Shield number
102296.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.250
You get it?

02:48.450 --> 02:50.630
(indistinct chatter)

02:51.870 --> 02:53.950
Get your hands off me.
Did you hear me?

02:54.150 --> 02:56.560
Looks like we missed
a hell of a party.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.820
Six men
and two women

02:58.020 --> 02:59.290
transported for
medical treatment.

02:59.490 --> 03:00.890
Four cross complaints
for assault

03:01.090 --> 03:03.060
and, my guess, we'll have
at least double that

03:03.260 --> 03:04.630
by the time we're through.

03:04.830 --> 03:07.070
Well, I'm really flattered that
you called me in, Officer...

03:07.270 --> 03:08.600
You wish, Reagan.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.800
...but you don't need squad
detectives for bumps, bruises,

03:11.000 --> 03:12.870
and some splattered
wedding cake.

03:13.070 --> 03:15.310
Well, how about grand larceny?
At least a hundred

03:15.510 --> 03:17.880
large in cash.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.880
Oh. Well, in that case,
I stand corrected.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.480
The wedding gifts?
Bingo.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.620
All of the envelopes vanished

03:23.820 --> 03:24.850
during the chaos of the fight.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.490
You got names?
A handful,

03:26.690 --> 03:28.750
on both sides
of the aisle.

03:28.950 --> 03:31.260
Looks like you kind of
buried the lede here.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.430
Not sure what you mean.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.630
The names DiPierro and Romano

03:33.830 --> 03:34.930
don't ring a bell to you?

03:35.130 --> 03:36.090
Mm-mm.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.500
Two of New York's

03:37.700 --> 03:39.870
oldest mob families.
Allegedly.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.640
Who've been at war with each
other for decades. Allegedly.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.040
BAEZ:
What kind of idiot steals

03:44.240 --> 03:46.570
from a crowded room
full of mobsters?

03:46.770 --> 03:48.410
One with a death wish,
apparently.

03:48.610 --> 03:49.440
Or a grudge.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.190
Or both.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.950
You told me that
he would pay for this!

03:57.150 --> 03:59.150
Screw you!

03:59.350 --> 04:00.770
Whoa.

04:06.310 --> 04:08.630
Don't even try
to make me feel better.

04:08.830 --> 04:11.300
That's not why I'm here.
She's right, you know.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.670
Her daughter's killer's
a free man because of me.

04:13.870 --> 04:16.400
Look, Adam Martin raped
and murdered her daughter,

04:16.600 --> 04:17.640
no doubt about it,

04:17.840 --> 04:19.170
and he'll get what
he's got coming.

04:19.370 --> 04:20.570
How? I lost the case.

04:20.770 --> 04:22.880
Her family's one shot
at justice.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.910
That's not necessarily true.
(sighs)

04:25.110 --> 04:26.810
Of course it is.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.310
Wait, what do you mean by that?

04:28.510 --> 04:31.020
I was hoping Melissa
came by to tell you herself.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.250
Tell me what?

04:32.450 --> 04:33.920
That she hired Jack Boyle

04:34.120 --> 04:35.490
to file a wrongful death suit

04:35.690 --> 04:37.890
against Adam Martin.
You're kidding me.

04:38.090 --> 04:38.990
Afraid not.

04:39.190 --> 04:40.660
Don't tell me you
called Jack again

04:40.860 --> 04:42.400
and asked him to take this on.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.630
No, I like my life,
and I would like to keep on

04:44.830 --> 04:47.570
living it.
(sighs)

04:47.770 --> 04:49.400
Why did he accept this case?

04:49.600 --> 04:50.740
You'd have to ask him.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.940
Well, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.540
Well, you can't do that.
Why not?

04:54.740 --> 04:57.310
Jack and I agreed
he would keep his distance

04:57.510 --> 04:59.110
until after the election.

04:59.310 --> 05:01.550
Erin, you can't go
anywhere near this thing,

05:01.750 --> 05:03.100
don't you understand?

05:05.830 --> 05:07.650
(indistinct chatter)

05:07.850 --> 05:10.260
Welcome to New York.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.720
Thank you.
Here you go.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.590
Welcome.
Hi.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.130
And above all else,

05:15.330 --> 05:17.600
we'd like to remind the world
New York always was,

05:17.800 --> 05:19.570
and always will be,

05:19.770 --> 05:21.600
a city with open arms.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.350
And last up on our agenda...

05:26.790 --> 05:29.760
...a kind of bittersweet
announcement.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.610
The retirement
of Canine Unit Officer

05:33.810 --> 05:35.280
Rigatoni the Third,

05:35.480 --> 05:38.350
the most successful
narcotics officer,

05:38.550 --> 05:40.290
man or dog,

05:40.490 --> 05:43.220
this department has ever seen.

05:43.420 --> 05:46.430
So...

05:46.630 --> 05:50.350
Thanks for your service,
Rigatoni.
(crowd laughing)

05:52.850 --> 05:54.200
And thank you all.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.500
HELEN:
Commissioner Reagan.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.890
You're very tenacious
today, Helen.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.140
What are your thoughts
on Mayor Chase's continued push

06:05.340 --> 06:08.510
to publicly and personally
welcome illegal immigrants

06:08.710 --> 06:11.630
to New York City.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.050
(sighs)

06:15.250 --> 06:18.060
Uh, well, the mayor may believe

06:18.260 --> 06:20.030
he's doing good,

06:20.230 --> 06:22.930
but, uh, I don't share
his illusions

06:23.130 --> 06:25.780
about what's really
going on with that.

06:28.850 --> 06:32.170
The fact is, he...

06:32.370 --> 06:35.470
is emceeing a game show
where these poor folks

06:35.670 --> 06:37.980
are brought up on his stage

06:38.180 --> 06:41.910
and then dumped into a system
that is overwhelmed,

06:42.110 --> 06:44.900
overburdened,
and utterly unprepared.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.650
So, if the mayor

06:48.850 --> 06:51.820
really wants to do good
for this city,

06:52.020 --> 06:54.830
he can start by giving
his police department

06:55.030 --> 06:56.860
the resources it needs

06:57.060 --> 06:59.780
to actually help
these immigrants.

07:04.990 --> 07:08.220
And, uh, that'll be all
for today.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.640
REPORTER:
Commissioner, please...

07:10.840 --> 07:14.360
(overlapping chatter)

07:16.360 --> 07:19.430
* *

07:39.790 --> 07:41.970
Listen, the fact

07:42.170 --> 07:44.280
that you would even suggest

07:44.480 --> 07:46.210
that I stole from my daughter

07:46.410 --> 07:47.950
on the day of her wedding...

07:48.150 --> 07:50.480
The day of my daughter's
wedding... <i>The Godfather.</i>

07:50.680 --> 07:52.080
Nice.
(sighs)

07:52.280 --> 07:53.920
Listen to me. Look at me.
Mm.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.260
Do you think I need money?
Hey, look at this.

07:57.460 --> 08:00.190
These shoes? They cost
more than your rent.

08:00.390 --> 08:01.560
You just decided
to ruin the best day

08:01.760 --> 08:03.330
of your daughter's life
for no reason?

08:03.530 --> 08:05.600
My son-in-law's idiot cousins,

08:05.800 --> 08:07.570
they're so hard
to control anyway,

08:07.770 --> 08:09.670
just add a three-hour open bar.

08:09.870 --> 08:12.200
And the haymakers
just start flying.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.710
I'm not proud of what I did,

08:13.910 --> 08:16.010
but that guy, that, uh,
Chris guy...
Mm-hmm.

08:16.210 --> 08:17.840
...he disrespected my wife.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.440
Right, 'cause the DiPierros
and the Romanos

08:19.650 --> 08:21.010
have been fighting for years,

08:21.210 --> 08:22.980
right?

08:23.180 --> 08:25.680
That is ancient history.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.990
And Gio DiPierro

08:28.190 --> 08:30.220
trying to whack your uncle
in broad daylight,

08:30.420 --> 08:31.460
that's ancient history, too?

08:31.660 --> 08:33.260
That's water under the bridge.

08:33.460 --> 08:34.830
Oh, okay.
Neither family

08:35.030 --> 08:37.060
have been involved
with organized crime

08:37.260 --> 08:38.730
for over 30 years.

08:38.930 --> 08:40.930
We could sit here and
lie to each other all day long,

08:41.130 --> 08:43.140
if that's
what you want.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.100
You want the truth?

08:45.300 --> 08:47.240
You shop at Payless shoes?

08:47.440 --> 08:49.310
(laughing)
Real funny, Detective.

08:49.510 --> 08:50.540
The truth is this,

08:50.740 --> 08:51.980
we sit there,
we grit our teeth,

08:52.180 --> 08:56.010
we smile, we pretend
like everything is okay

08:56.210 --> 08:57.280
for the children.
Oh.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.220
But deep down inside,

08:59.420 --> 09:02.320
everybody at that wedding
knows exactly

09:02.520 --> 09:03.990
what happened
with these two families.

09:04.190 --> 09:07.060
Only for the children.
Faith and forgiveness, right?

09:07.260 --> 09:10.530
I have a limit to my patience.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.300
And I tell you
right now,

09:12.500 --> 09:15.300
if I find out
those DiPierro boys

09:15.500 --> 09:17.700
stole from
my little baby Francesca...

09:17.900 --> 09:19.500
You'll make them an offer
they can't refuse.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.710
You'll, uh, put a horse head
under the sheet.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.010
Am I free to go?

09:24.210 --> 09:26.760
You were free
four and a half hours ago.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.220
Get him out of there.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.650
MAN:
Anthony threw the glass, not me.

09:31.850 --> 09:33.090
MAN 2:
Then the kids started fighting.

09:33.290 --> 09:34.890
Her sister started it.
(overlapping arguing)

09:35.090 --> 09:37.390
Well?
I have Roberts
and Patesko

09:37.590 --> 09:38.690
helping out with interviews,

09:38.890 --> 09:40.760
but they're both getting
the same story,

09:40.960 --> 09:42.230
across the board.
Let me guess.

09:42.430 --> 09:43.900
"I didn't see nothing."
More or less.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.830
Plus, TARU

09:46.030 --> 09:47.070
has gone through

09:47.270 --> 09:49.640
dozens of hours
of useless footage.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.040
DANNY:
There's got to be somebody.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.400
Staff? Vendors?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.570
Dozens of people
had access to that cash.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.980
From what I gathered,
everybody pretty much knew

09:57.180 --> 09:58.910
exactly who
they were dealing with.

09:59.110 --> 10:00.650
In other words,
if they stole that money,

10:00.850 --> 10:02.050
it was a death sentence.
Exactly.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.450
Where'd you land with the dad?
Obnoxious.

10:04.650 --> 10:06.920
Pretentious. (sighs)
Too rich for his own good.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.920
Is that what he told you?

10:09.120 --> 10:10.820
You hear something different?
I can't say

10:11.020 --> 10:14.740
for sure, but I can think
of two people who can.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.150
Let's get the honeymoon started.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.900
You're treating me
like a perp.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.500
I'm a cop.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.820
He is the criminal.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.180
You arrested that perp, right?

10:31.380 --> 10:32.650
He didn't commit a crime.

10:32.850 --> 10:34.710
I can prove he did.

10:34.910 --> 10:36.110
Then tell me what happened.

10:36.310 --> 10:38.220
My grandson, Vince,

10:38.420 --> 10:40.820
was playing football
for Notre Dame,

10:41.020 --> 10:43.420
and he fractured his vertebrae.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.560
Doctor prescribed opioids
for his recovery?

10:46.760 --> 10:49.160
And that was

10:49.360 --> 10:51.450
the beginning of the end.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.630
I'm sorry.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.440
I want you to do something.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.450
What can I do? You tell me.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.080
These kind of cases
are very hard to prove.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.650
So what does that mean?
That you don't try?

11:07.850 --> 11:09.150
No, I'm not saying that.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.380
I had to do something.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.570
But you shouldn't
have done what you did.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.160
I feel for you,

11:17.360 --> 11:18.870
and I understand your pain.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.330
How could you possibly

11:24.530 --> 11:28.070
understand my pain?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.950
I'm trying.

11:34.190 --> 11:35.840
Okay.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.180
Okay, I-I'll look into
your grandson's case, but...

11:39.380 --> 11:41.250
you got to promise
you won't interfere

11:41.450 --> 11:43.730
with this investigation anymore.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.770
I can't promise that.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.060
(chuckles) Emceeing a game show?

11:56.260 --> 11:58.400
Pretty much.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.530
Walk it back.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.570
Right after you stop hosting it.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.070
What world are you living in?

12:03.270 --> 12:04.570
The real one, Mr. Mayor.

12:04.770 --> 12:05.940
Where you're
the sheriff of where?

12:06.140 --> 12:07.310
New Alamo, Texas?

12:07.510 --> 12:09.740
In New York, where we
do not have the resources

12:09.940 --> 12:11.580
to support this kind of influx.

12:11.780 --> 12:12.980
You think I invited them?

12:13.180 --> 12:15.910
No, but you sure act
like you did.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.600
I act like a leader.
Try it sometime.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.690
(sighs) My people are
overwhelmed and underpaid...

12:22.890 --> 12:25.420
Your people should be prepared
for anything.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.290
How come everyone
thinks that but you?

12:27.490 --> 12:29.900
36,000 bussed-in migrants

12:30.100 --> 12:32.560
and counting,
so give me a break.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.500
And what do you propose we do?

12:34.700 --> 12:37.070
Leave these people out on their
own while we rag on each other?

12:37.270 --> 12:40.410
Do you even know where they go
after they get off that bus?

12:40.610 --> 12:42.270
Do you know
where they came from?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.780
Squalor, gang wars,
oppressive regimes.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.680
So give me the resources
and I will gladly support

12:48.880 --> 12:51.080
as many people
as you care to welcome.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.750
So, a cash grab disguised
as humanitarian effort.

12:53.950 --> 12:56.320
No, not in the least.
You're drowning here,

12:56.520 --> 12:58.360
and I'm throwing
you a lifesaver.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.280
Find the money, yesterday.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.430
I had my staffers draft this up

13:03.630 --> 13:06.580
after your
little outburst.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.700
(sighs)

13:11.900 --> 13:13.110
What am I looking at?

13:13.310 --> 13:14.370
Starting this week,

13:14.570 --> 13:16.740
we announce your officers
will be on duty

13:16.940 --> 13:20.960
at all of our refugee shelters,
round the clock.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.020
(sighs) Mr. Mayor,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.720
my people are already
spread too thin.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.450
It's the only solution.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.060
It's a stunt.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.560
We've got the Statue Of Liberty
in our front yard.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.290
There's no
getting around that.

13:34.490 --> 13:35.990
We set the example.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.600
Of what?
Reckless wishful thinking?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.530
I don't think you're hearing me.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.240
This is not a request.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.990
Go get it done.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.760
(sighs)

13:51.790 --> 13:52.880
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.710
I'm gonna have to call you back.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.050
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't listen.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.930
That's okay, I can handle her.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.720
What am I doing?

14:01.920 --> 14:02.890
What do you think
you're doing?

14:03.090 --> 14:04.690
You shouldn't
be here, and

14:04.890 --> 14:06.160
shouldn't you be thanking me?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.960
Thanking you?
Thanking you for what?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.530
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.030
A favor?

14:11.230 --> 14:13.600
I know you, Erin.
I know that it's killing you

14:13.800 --> 14:16.070
that this family
wasn't going to get any closure.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.670
Closure? The only thing
this would give them

14:17.870 --> 14:19.870
is a possible
financial settlement.

14:20.070 --> 14:23.040
Yeah, which is better
than nothing. Adam Martin

14:23.240 --> 14:24.940
is a wealthy, powerful man.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.280
And, look, I was just
trying to help.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.880
Oh, so now I'm
supposed to believe

14:29.080 --> 14:30.680
that you're selflessly
coming to the rescue

14:30.880 --> 14:32.670
of this family?
Of you.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.320
Of me?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.790
Mm-hmm.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.490
You are not rescuing me.

14:39.690 --> 14:41.960
If you file this suit,

14:42.160 --> 14:45.330
the optics are gonna be
terrible, Jack.

14:45.530 --> 14:46.760
You are gonna be
required

14:46.970 --> 14:48.800
to paint the ADA
that fumbled this case

14:49.000 --> 14:50.970
in a horrible light. That's me.

14:51.170 --> 14:54.840
And the fact that the lawyer
doing this is my ex?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.240
The press is gonna have
a field day.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.680
When did you start caring
about the press?

14:59.880 --> 15:02.920
Uh...
And optics?

15:03.120 --> 15:06.520
This is the right thing to do
for this family.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.420
Let someone else handle it.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.190
You know I'm the best.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.090
And the Erin Reagan
that I know

15:13.290 --> 15:16.790
would want this family to get
some semblance of justice,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.350
no matter the cost to herself.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.400
We arrested a retired sergeant
this morning

15:26.600 --> 15:27.840
for holding a guy at gunpoint.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.570
And let me guess,
you took the side of the guy

15:29.770 --> 15:30.780
who held someone at gunpoint?

15:30.980 --> 15:32.710
The former NYPD sergeant.

15:32.910 --> 15:34.910
He's frustrated
and grieving,

15:35.110 --> 15:36.350
and he claims that this guy

15:36.550 --> 15:38.880
sold his grandson drugs
laced with fentanyl.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.420
Which I'm sure
the detective on the case

15:40.620 --> 15:41.690
will be happy to know.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.660
He said the detective
knows it's this guy,

15:43.860 --> 15:44.960
just hasn't done anything.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.590
Then what do you want me
to do about it?

15:46.790 --> 15:47.690
I pulled the stats.

15:47.890 --> 15:49.360
There's an all-time high number

15:49.560 --> 15:50.500
of fentanyl overdoses

15:50.700 --> 15:51.800
in our precinct this year.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.400
Same with every other
precinct.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.670
Well, chances are this dealer
has been selling to other people

15:55.870 --> 15:57.270
and could be responsible
for more deaths.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.600
I'm sure you're right,
but I can't just take a case

15:59.800 --> 16:01.640
and begin investigating it
because you feel like

16:01.840 --> 16:02.940
the detective
didn't do their job.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.880
But who knows how many lives
we could save

16:05.080 --> 16:07.030
if we get this dealer
off the street.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.050
Okay, I will take a look
with my team,

16:12.250 --> 16:14.050
but, unless we find
some new bit of intel,

16:14.250 --> 16:17.310
I am not bigfooting
the detective on the case.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.790
We appreciate you
seeing us,

16:20.990 --> 16:22.660
especially given
the circumstances.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.200
No, it's fine,
Detective, really.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.600
This is exactly how
I envisioned my honeymoon.

16:27.800 --> 16:28.670
This won't take long.

16:28.870 --> 16:30.340
Does seem
fitting, though.

16:30.540 --> 16:31.400
Typical mess.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.540
What does that mean?

16:32.740 --> 16:33.870
(sighs)

16:34.070 --> 16:35.470
There's not exactly
a lot of love lost

16:35.670 --> 16:36.670
between our families.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.280
Why not move then?

16:39.480 --> 16:40.610
Elope?

16:40.810 --> 16:41.910
Have you ever met an Italian?

16:42.110 --> 16:43.820
JOHN:
What she's trying to say is,

16:44.020 --> 16:45.920
family's important
to us.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.520
No. What I'm saying is,

16:48.720 --> 16:49.920
is that Italian men

16:50.120 --> 16:51.490
do not just run away
from their mothers.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.130
DANNY:
What about your fathers?

16:53.330 --> 16:54.590
What's the story with them?

16:54.790 --> 16:57.100
Two hardworking men
living the American dream.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.160
BAEZ:
Are you sure about that?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.630
JOHN:
Absolutely.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.100
100%.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.400
DANNY:
What about your father,
Francesca?

17:04.600 --> 17:05.570
What's the story with him?

17:05.770 --> 17:07.740
Same story,
of course.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.220
Really?

17:10.830 --> 17:11.980
Can we not do this?

17:12.180 --> 17:14.450
DANNY:
Actually, we should
hear from you.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.530
Is it true or not?

17:19.700 --> 17:20.890
What are they talking about?

17:21.090 --> 17:23.790
You have a great relationship
with my father,

17:23.990 --> 17:26.360
and it means everything
to me,

17:26.560 --> 17:29.730
but the truth is,

17:29.930 --> 17:33.050
he hasn't been honest with you.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.330
You're scaring me,
Franny.

17:36.530 --> 17:39.840
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just...

17:40.040 --> 17:42.260
he's broke.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.180
JOHN:
What?

17:45.380 --> 17:47.780
What about
the wedding?

17:47.980 --> 17:49.150
You know, the Rolex?

17:49.350 --> 17:52.250
I mean, that probably
put him in the poor house.

17:52.450 --> 17:55.150
My mom, a few months back,
she got drunk.

17:55.350 --> 17:58.460
She told me that
the well's dried up.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.330
You know this for sure?

18:00.530 --> 18:03.360
No. I'm not involved
in the business,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.600
but...

18:05.800 --> 18:07.770
I can hear it in his voice.

18:07.970 --> 18:11.300
See it in the way that he walks.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.420
Carmine Romano is a proud man.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.660
And this is killing him.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.390
Detective O'Leary.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.690
Susan. What do you need, Sarge?

18:34.890 --> 18:36.930
My team's looking into
a rash of fentanyl overdoes

18:37.130 --> 18:38.730
in the precinct.
I'd like to ask you

18:38.930 --> 18:40.830
a few questions about the death
of Vince Velucci.

18:41.030 --> 18:43.440
No disrespect, boss, but I don't
really appreciate you guys

18:43.640 --> 18:45.700
coming in here
and poking your nose in my case.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.410
Somebody was already here?

18:47.610 --> 18:49.410
Your wife was here an hour ago.

18:49.610 --> 18:52.010
Officer Janko came to see you?

18:52.210 --> 18:53.710
Yeah, and she grilled me
on my case.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.950
Might want to remind her
how things work around here.

18:56.150 --> 18:58.480
I only have two bosses
that I answer to.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.050
My squad sergeant
and my C.O., that's it.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.020
Just like to ask you
a few questions.
I'm due in court.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.890
I don't have time
to go through it all again.

19:05.090 --> 19:07.360
You want to know
what's going on?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.840
Go home and ask your wife.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.870
And what are we getting
from the precincts concerned?

19:17.070 --> 19:20.410
They're dealing with thousands
of people, no I.D.,

19:20.610 --> 19:22.710
no work, no home.
They don't even

19:22.910 --> 19:24.740
speak the same language.
It's a mess, boss.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.910
But careful with
the messaging, please.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.750
If there's any questioning
NYPD support,

19:29.950 --> 19:31.880
it's gonna be taken as if
we're anti-immigrant.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.790
This is about limited manpower
and budget. That is all.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.150
GARRETT:
Come on, Frank.

19:36.350 --> 19:38.320
Your "that is all"
isn't gonna be the be all

19:38.520 --> 19:39.990
and end all in this.

19:40.190 --> 19:43.460
Garrett, my only concern is
the safety of these immigrants

19:43.660 --> 19:45.130
and the citizens of New York.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.960
Again, says you.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.700
Yes. I speak for me

19:49.900 --> 19:53.440
and this department,
and I can't take more officers

19:53.640 --> 19:55.310
off the street and post them up

19:55.510 --> 19:58.610
in these encampments
for the mayor's political gain.

19:58.810 --> 20:01.310
This is about more
than the mayor's ambition.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.720
(sighs) Look, I know that.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.250
This is New York City,

20:05.450 --> 20:08.550
which has always been a beacon
of hope and refuge.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.820
Yes. I know that, too.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.060
But you've got to say it louder.
Garrett is right on.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.960
This thing gets parsed
like nothing else.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.150
You can't just get in the weeds
with your put-upon police force.

20:26.420 --> 20:30.380
Budget cuts, record attrition,
revolving door courts,

20:30.580 --> 20:34.210
an anti-cop fog
that never lifts.

20:34.410 --> 20:36.760
You bet, put-upon.

20:40.230 --> 20:41.320
Point taken.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.020
But she's right
about the optics.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.540
Yeah, I know,
I hate when that happens.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.560
Get me the governor
on the phone.

20:49.760 --> 20:50.630
BAKER:
For what?

20:50.830 --> 20:52.830
Sorry, that just came out.

20:53.030 --> 20:53.700
For what?

20:53.900 --> 20:54.700
Reinforcements.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.000
We need State Troopers.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.700
I'm pretty sure
that's the mayor's call.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.500
And I'm pretty sure
he hasn't made it.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.110
Gasoline on the fire.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.110
I don't care.

21:03.310 --> 21:06.560
We need more boots
on the ground. Forthwith.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.270
(door opens, closes)

21:17.410 --> 21:21.230
I should've introduced
the third witness's testimony.

21:21.430 --> 21:23.900
We had two other witnesses
we agreed

21:24.100 --> 21:26.530
were more reliable.
Yeah, well, the jury disagreed.

21:26.730 --> 21:29.670
The third witness could've been
the crucial piece of evidence

21:29.870 --> 21:30.740
to push the needle.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.600
Could've, would've, should've.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.340
(sighs)
The trial is over.

21:34.540 --> 21:35.670
It's time to move on.

21:35.870 --> 21:37.540
I don't make mistakes like this.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.740
It wasn't a mistake.
It was

21:38.940 --> 21:40.680
a judgment call,
and there's no way

21:40.880 --> 21:42.310
of knowing if it would've
changed a thing.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.980
But it's a possibility.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.780
Well, I don't have
a crystal ball.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.250
Thinking like that, you're
gonna drive yourself crazy.

21:48.450 --> 21:49.490
Maybe I was distracted.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.220
I-I-I mean,

21:51.420 --> 21:53.360
is any campaign
worth this?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.890
What does this have to do
with the campaign?

21:57.090 --> 21:59.860
Well, maybe I was
more focused on that.
That's not true.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.770
You turned down everything
that Bobbi asked you to do.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.700
Because I told the people
of the State of New York

22:04.900 --> 22:06.000
to come on down,

22:06.200 --> 22:08.040
see me in action,
so I can prove to you

22:08.240 --> 22:10.310
that I'm the best person
for D.A.

22:10.510 --> 22:11.880
So what am I
supposed to say now?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.450
"Hey, actually,
don't come down because

22:14.650 --> 22:15.710
I actually suck"?

22:15.910 --> 22:17.280
Erin, come on.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.520
I'm bringing this to Jack.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.820
Why would you do that?

22:20.020 --> 22:21.890
So I can help Melissa
win the suit.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.920
Listen to me, if you throw
yourself under the bus,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.910
you're throwing away any shot
at becoming district attorney.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.800
My office, now.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.540
Whoa. Thought I had
some explaining to do,

22:38.740 --> 22:40.040
but... (chuckles)

22:40.240 --> 22:42.070
You shouldn't have to
explain anything.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.080
What were you thinking
grilling Detective O'Leary?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.010
Susan? I asked her
a couple questions.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.380
You would've done
the same thing.

22:48.580 --> 22:51.320
I would've n...
(sighs)

22:51.520 --> 22:53.550
I would've never gone over
a sergeant's head

22:53.750 --> 22:55.920
and questioned a detective
on their handling of a case.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.390
Are you pulling rank
on me?

22:57.590 --> 22:59.760
You are a patrol officer.
You are not a detective.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.330
I made a promise
to Sam.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.910
You got to stop doing that.

23:05.310 --> 23:06.460
Doing what?

23:06.660 --> 23:07.870
Making promises
that you can't deliver.

23:08.070 --> 23:09.800
Sam deserves justice
for his grandson.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.940
I am sure he does,

23:11.140 --> 23:12.040
but I don't even
know the guy.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.440
Well, if...
(knock on door)

23:13.640 --> 23:14.810
Sergeant Reagan?

23:15.010 --> 23:16.220
Could you give me
five minutes, please?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.340
If you'd have met him, you
would've done the same thing.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.710
I did look into the overdose,
like you asked me,

23:21.910 --> 23:23.380
but I did it because
it was good intel,

23:23.580 --> 23:25.420
not because I made a promise
to a grieving man.

23:25.620 --> 23:26.980
Well, then
what did you think?

23:27.180 --> 23:29.550
I think we may be able
to tie this dealer

23:29.750 --> 23:30.790
to numerous
other deaths.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.320
Then what the hell
are we fighting about?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.090
Because I was gonna ask
Detective O'Leary to open

23:34.290 --> 23:35.660
a joint investigation,
but since you pissed her off,

23:35.860 --> 23:37.600
that's not gonna happen.
We don't even need her.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.830
She already admitted she's
confident Marco sold the drugs,

23:40.030 --> 23:42.350
she just doesn't have
enough evidence to arrest him.

23:43.750 --> 23:44.900
Well, what does she have?

23:45.100 --> 23:46.970
Text messages
on the victim's phone

23:47.170 --> 23:49.270
asking to score from Marco.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.240
The night he died?

23:51.440 --> 23:54.410
Yeah, but she can't tie Marco
to the area that night

23:54.610 --> 23:56.860
or confirm he made the deal.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.650
You have his information?

23:59.850 --> 24:02.970
Yeah, I even met him.

24:10.140 --> 24:13.260
Carmine, Carmine, Carmine.
(groans)

24:13.460 --> 24:14.670
Got a second to chat?

24:14.870 --> 24:16.370
Just got to clear
a few things up.

24:16.570 --> 24:17.870
No, thank you.

24:18.070 --> 24:20.000
Come on, Carmine.
Where the hell you gonna go?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.310
Just stay and talk to us
for a minute.

24:21.510 --> 24:22.770
Listen to me,
you're not gonna hold me

24:22.970 --> 24:25.080
for another nine hours.
Come on.

24:25.280 --> 24:29.330
You know what? Why don't you
just call my lawyer, okay?

24:54.920 --> 24:56.890
He's alive.
Get a bus.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.330
Come on, Carmine.

25:11.170 --> 25:12.390
Oh, come on.

25:12.590 --> 25:14.030
Are you saying nobody
at this table

25:14.230 --> 25:16.640
has ever considered
moving somewhere else?

25:17.810 --> 25:20.360
I've thought about
kicking it out to the country

25:20.560 --> 25:21.530
one of these days.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.400
Really?
Uh-oh.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.640
Yeah, a big backyard,
a dishwasher,

25:25.840 --> 25:27.270
no rats in the trash.

25:27.470 --> 25:28.940
When you put it
like that...

25:29.140 --> 25:30.140
Couldn't agree more.

25:30.340 --> 25:31.540
ERIN:
Yeah, seconded.

25:31.740 --> 25:32.880
HENRY:
Betty and I
used to dream

25:33.080 --> 25:35.450
of a nice little ranch
somewhere warm.

25:35.650 --> 25:36.980
FRANK:
Okay, look,

25:37.180 --> 25:38.650
let me rephrase.

25:38.850 --> 25:41.520
New York is expensive, dirty,

25:41.720 --> 25:44.090
full of crime,
and freezing in the winter.

25:44.290 --> 25:46.760
Not to mention a melting
hellscape all summer long.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.260
Not to mention,
it smells like crap.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.260
Not <i>like</i> crap.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.300
(laughter)
True.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.030
Okay, true,
but TMI.

25:54.230 --> 25:57.000
So, the question remains,
what's keeping us here?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.540
And don't say pizza, Sean.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.440
Bagels.
Same difference.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.210
SEAN:
No, I'm serious.

26:02.410 --> 26:05.910
You remember, every Sunday,
after hockey practice...

26:06.110 --> 26:08.810
Yeah. Me, you, Gramps,

26:09.010 --> 26:11.050
couple everything bagels
and a...

26:11.250 --> 26:12.780
newspaper split
three ways.

26:12.980 --> 26:13.790
Yup.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.690
HENRY: I got
the sports page.

26:15.890 --> 26:17.290
Sean got the funnies.

26:17.490 --> 26:19.670
That's my point.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.030
So the beauty is in the details.

26:23.230 --> 26:24.530
JANKO:
Exactly.

26:24.730 --> 26:26.430
Like knowing every bartender
in a three-block radius.

26:26.630 --> 26:27.700
All 30 of them.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.830
Or running
into a subway performer

26:30.030 --> 26:32.340
you swear could
sell out Yankee Stadium.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.570
Or just running over a Yankee.

26:34.770 --> 26:37.040
One time,
and you guys won't let me

26:37.240 --> 26:38.880
forget it, come on!

26:39.080 --> 26:40.480
Where are you
in all this, Dad?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.200
You dream of a little
cheeseburger in paradise?

26:45.200 --> 26:46.780
Well...

26:46.980 --> 26:50.350
you know those rats
in the trash cans?

26:50.550 --> 26:52.120
Well, out in the country,

26:52.320 --> 26:53.560
they're raccoons.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.510
And they're bigger and meaner.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.230
To the devil you know.

26:59.430 --> 27:00.400
That's right.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
Hear, hear.
The devil you know.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.520
There you go.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.140
Hello, Carmine.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.610
(sighs)

27:11.810 --> 27:14.210
Hey, Nurse, I'm being invaded.
Knock it off.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.580
Hey.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.650
I got nothing to say
to you guys.

27:17.850 --> 27:20.320
We're just here to try to help
you figure out who did this.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.320
Why don't you just look
in the freaking mirror?

27:22.520 --> 27:24.720
Oh, so we're the ones
that blew up your car?
Just as well!

27:24.920 --> 27:27.590
You told Johnny DiPierro
I was broke.

27:27.790 --> 27:29.760
You put the target on my back!

27:29.960 --> 27:30.960
I thought
the DiPierros have been

27:31.160 --> 27:32.460
out of the game
for 30 years now?

27:32.660 --> 27:34.230
I guess old habits.

27:34.430 --> 27:37.000
Ah.
It was your daughter
who told her husband.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.470
You had to know that was
gonna happen eventually.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.340
Only after you guys
came around.

27:41.540 --> 27:44.440
Just imagine if my wife
or my daughter was in the car!

27:44.640 --> 27:46.880
DANNY:
You know, I've been wondering
the same thing myself all day.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.110
Who the hell would take
such a massive risk

27:49.310 --> 27:50.750
over a guy like you?

27:50.950 --> 27:53.520
Look at me, I would never
steal from my daughter.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.050
How dare you say that!
DANNY: Come on, Carmine.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.290
There had to be a reason
there was a target on your back.

27:58.490 --> 27:59.760
You got ten seconds

27:59.960 --> 28:01.660
to get out of my face.

28:01.860 --> 28:03.360
You understand?
Or what?

28:03.560 --> 28:05.530
Or what?!
You got ten seconds to get
the hell out of my face!

28:05.730 --> 28:06.860
Or what are you gonna do?!
Get out of here!

28:07.060 --> 28:08.270
What are you gonna do?!
Come on, let's go.

28:08.470 --> 28:09.470
Bye, little boy,
goodbye-bye-bye!

28:09.670 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, pull him
out of here.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.670
I don't think
Carmine's our guy.

28:12.870 --> 28:14.570
What are you talking about,
he's not our guy?

28:14.770 --> 28:16.340
I just got a text from
Officer Roberts saying

28:16.540 --> 28:18.940
they arrested a busboy for
stealing wedding gifts again.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.280
Hold on.
Same venue, same M.O.?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.700
Mm-hmm.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.560
Can I help you
find anything?

28:32.760 --> 28:34.690
Yeah, you got anything
that's not in the case?

28:34.890 --> 28:36.790
Hey, man, this ain't
that kind of place.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.630
That's not what I heard.

28:38.830 --> 28:39.830
I don't care what you heard.

28:40.030 --> 28:41.400
We don't do that here.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.900
Come on, man, I've got cash.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.550
Help me out?

28:46.050 --> 28:47.440
Okay.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.110
What are you
looking for?

28:49.310 --> 28:50.810
You got Murder 8?

28:51.010 --> 28:53.280
I have a few.
That's gonna be 250.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.080
I got it.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.660
(sniffs)

29:06.010 --> 29:07.420
Get the hell out of here.
Whoa, man!

29:07.620 --> 29:10.060
If you ever think about
coming back, I'll kill you.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.900
I'm not looking for any trouble.
I just want to score.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.300
And I said I don't do that here.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.700
Yeah, but you took
my money.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.300
You lucky I ain't take
your life. Now get lost!

29:16.500 --> 29:17.570
Police! Don't move!

29:17.770 --> 29:19.600
Yo, man, I was just
defending myself.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.610
This addict was trying
to rob the register.

29:21.810 --> 29:22.910
Police. Get your hands
behind your back.

29:23.110 --> 29:24.610
You're under arrest.
Damn, you a cop?

29:24.810 --> 29:27.180
Gun. You got cuffs?
OFFICER: Yes, boss.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.510
JAMIE:
I don't suppose you got
a license for that gun?

29:29.710 --> 29:31.380
(grunts)

29:31.580 --> 29:33.990
Some guy pulled a gun out on me
this week. I got to defend

29:34.190 --> 29:35.650
myself, but I swear,
I don't sell no drugs!

29:35.850 --> 29:37.250
JAMIE:
Yeah, save it.

29:37.450 --> 29:38.990
There's product back here
in plain view.

29:39.190 --> 29:41.280
I suggest you start
telling the truth.

29:43.810 --> 29:46.150
JAMIE: Come on, tell us.
OFFICER: Come with me.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.370
Okay, why don't we just
go over it one more time

29:53.570 --> 29:54.840
just to make sure we got all

29:55.040 --> 29:56.370
our facts straight.
I already said it was me, man.

29:56.570 --> 29:57.940
Just let me sign the damn thing.

29:58.140 --> 30:00.780
I know what you said, but
let's just go over it, okay?

30:00.980 --> 30:02.750
You say you bus weddings
two nights

30:02.950 --> 30:04.550
a week at the Marksby,
is that right?

30:04.750 --> 30:06.320
Sundays, too, if they need me.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.150
So you a really long time
to plan out this robbery, right?

30:09.350 --> 30:12.120
I don't know, man.
It just happened.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.460
I saw an opening.

30:13.660 --> 30:14.890
Mm, okay, man.

30:15.090 --> 30:16.760
I mean,
let's talk about it.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.800
The first heist you...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.060
disappear without a trace,

30:20.260 --> 30:21.930
like Danny Ocean
or something.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.770
But then the second time you
do it with more time to plan,

30:24.970 --> 30:26.900
you somehow are
careless enough to let

30:27.100 --> 30:29.290
half the bridal party see you.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.310
Seems a little out of character

30:32.510 --> 30:34.580
for a man with your skill set,
don't you think?

30:34.780 --> 30:36.410
I guess I got cocky.

30:36.610 --> 30:38.520
Hmm. Or maybe

30:38.720 --> 30:40.080
there's something else
going on

30:40.280 --> 30:43.840
that you don't feel
like telling us about just yet.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.460
What am I looking at?

30:52.660 --> 30:55.230
Do you know who the Romanos
and DiPierros are?

30:55.430 --> 30:57.330
Some flashy Italians
with too much money?

30:57.530 --> 31:00.920
This is what those families do
to people who cross them.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.680
DANNY:
Now let's talk about
what really happened, okay?

31:08.880 --> 31:10.810
Somebody told you
to take the fall

31:11.020 --> 31:12.520
for the first heist.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.850
I told you, man, it was my idea.

31:15.050 --> 31:17.050
And then they paid you

31:17.250 --> 31:19.860
to come in
and botch the second one.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.760
So it would look like
it was you who did both

31:22.960 --> 31:25.430
instead of them all along,
isn't that right?

31:25.630 --> 31:28.900
This is more than just a
couple years behind bars, Owen.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.370
Take a look at the photos.

31:31.570 --> 31:33.440
Really look at them.
They'll do

31:33.640 --> 31:36.260
the same thing to you, if they
think you stole from them.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.450
DANNY: You think you're
gonna walk out the door

31:46.650 --> 31:48.820
sticking to the story
that it was you all along,

31:49.020 --> 31:52.410
there's no telling what
they're gonna do to you next.

31:54.510 --> 31:57.240
You feeling like telling us
what really happened now?

32:02.620 --> 32:03.950
Good.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.970
BOYLE:
You sure you want to do this?

32:09.170 --> 32:10.840
I don't want to, but...

32:11.040 --> 32:12.580
I know I have to.

32:12.780 --> 32:13.840
(knocking)

32:14.050 --> 32:15.710
(door opens)

32:15.910 --> 32:17.580
Mrs. Phillips is here.
Please send her in.

32:17.780 --> 32:20.230
(inhales deeply)

32:27.980 --> 32:29.790
What the hell is she doing here?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.530
Look, I know I'm the last person
that you want to see right now.

32:32.730 --> 32:33.800
That's right.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.200
But, please,
just hear me out.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.070
I don't have
to do anything for you.

32:37.270 --> 32:38.400
BOYLE:
Give her a chance.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.870
She can help us.
How?

32:40.070 --> 32:41.040
Hasn't she done enough?

32:41.240 --> 32:42.340
There was a third witness

32:42.540 --> 32:44.740
I decided not to call
to testify.

32:44.940 --> 32:46.880
Why would you do that?

32:47.080 --> 32:49.310
I felt the other two were
more trustworthy

32:49.510 --> 32:51.750
and would play better
to the jury.

32:51.950 --> 32:53.620
So what're you saying?

32:53.820 --> 32:56.120
So I can't redo
the trial,

32:56.320 --> 32:57.920
but I can and will
do anything necessary

32:58.120 --> 32:59.460
to help your family.

32:59.660 --> 33:00.720
How does this help?

33:00.920 --> 33:03.660
We can include
in our suit that ADA Reagan

33:03.860 --> 33:05.700
failed to introduce
crucial evidence

33:05.900 --> 33:07.550
that could've swayed the jury.

33:08.350 --> 33:11.100
I'm willing to admit
that the third witness

33:11.300 --> 33:13.990
could've helped put
Adam Martin in prison.

33:15.690 --> 33:17.240
I can't believe this.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.380
Look, I've been
beating myself up about this,

33:19.580 --> 33:21.510
and if I could go back
and do things differently,

33:21.710 --> 33:23.210
I would, but I can't.

33:23.410 --> 33:25.070
So...

33:26.200 --> 33:29.500
...I am determined
to help you build your suit.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.140
And then you go around my back
and call the governor?

33:39.150 --> 33:42.030
Well, he's the one
who should be handling this.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.430
Not your call to make.

33:43.630 --> 33:44.970
It was necessary.

33:45.170 --> 33:46.600
And overdue.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.210
I'm in charge of this city.

33:48.410 --> 33:49.610
Come on.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.140
He should send in State Troopers

33:51.340 --> 33:52.780
to handle this and you know it.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.680
That's not happening.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.750
Mr. Mayor...

33:56.950 --> 33:59.420
we need our manpower
on the streets,

33:59.620 --> 34:01.990
not rent-a-copping
these shelters.

34:02.190 --> 34:04.320
And I disagree,
and I'm the boss of this.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.490
Then go
to the governor yourself.

34:07.690 --> 34:10.160
You took that bullet out
of my gun by going over my head.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.500
Then call him out publicly.
Great plan!

34:12.700 --> 34:14.350
How did I not think of that?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.170
And why not?

34:17.370 --> 34:19.040
Because you and the governor
are members

34:19.240 --> 34:20.840
of the same party?

34:21.040 --> 34:22.890
What are you hinting at?

34:24.590 --> 34:25.910
Well...

34:26.110 --> 34:28.380
it sure seems
you're positioning yourself

34:28.580 --> 34:30.350
for higher office.

34:30.550 --> 34:33.020
If I was looking
to take the governor's job,

34:33.220 --> 34:35.020
I'd jump at the chance
to call him out.

34:35.220 --> 34:37.820
A kid running for student
council knows that move.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.560
I'm taking this stand
so other mayors

34:40.760 --> 34:42.490
see how New York is responding

34:42.690 --> 34:44.900
and follow suit.
You think that's easy?

34:45.100 --> 34:47.560
Okay, then put your money
where your mouth is.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.500
Up my budget and have your show.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.970
You have by far the biggest,
most expensive

34:52.170 --> 34:53.900
police department
in the country as it is.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.170
In the city
that's the hardest to police.

34:56.370 --> 34:57.810
Figure out a way
within your already

34:58.010 --> 34:59.780
inflated budget
to make this work.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.150
<i>Deflated</i> budget.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.060
Twice, on your watch.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.750
Another bus arrives tomorrow.

35:05.950 --> 35:07.680
I will be there to welcome it

35:07.880 --> 35:09.940
with open arms.

35:12.770 --> 35:14.230
And you expect

35:14.430 --> 35:17.180
my people to be there, too?

35:18.210 --> 35:20.450
The more the merrier.

35:33.530 --> 35:34.610
Why are we sitting
around here?

35:34.810 --> 35:36.880
Because I want
to offer you help.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.780
Why would you want
to help me?

35:38.980 --> 35:41.220
Because I want
this stuff off the street.

35:41.420 --> 35:43.850
And I know that you're just
a dealer with a store.

35:44.050 --> 35:45.690
So you want me to turn
on my supplier?

35:45.890 --> 35:47.460
If you can help us
get them,

35:47.660 --> 35:49.680
you can still have
a life after this.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.600
I'll help

35:52.800 --> 35:54.000
if you drop the charges.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.070
Completely?
I don't think that's possible.

35:56.270 --> 35:58.100
Then there's no way
I'm turning on anybody

35:58.300 --> 35:59.940
and risking my life.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.640
(door opens)

36:01.840 --> 36:04.530
Sergeant,
can I have a word with him?

36:06.360 --> 36:08.260
JAMIE:
Yeah, go for it.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.660
I'll speak to the D.A. on your
behalf and say you cooperated,

36:23.860 --> 36:26.760
if you write a letter
to the D.A. saying

36:26.960 --> 36:28.570
you don't want
Sam Velucci prosecuted

36:28.770 --> 36:30.270
for holding you at gunpoint.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.270
So you'll only help me

36:32.470 --> 36:33.740
if I get that crazy dude off?

36:33.940 --> 36:36.090
He's not crazy.
He's grieving.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.060
You sold his grandson drugs
that killed him.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.200
You're lucky he didn't shoot you
when he had the chance.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.680
I'm not helping that wacko.
You're gonna be charged

36:47.880 --> 36:49.450
with criminal possession
of a controlled substance

36:49.650 --> 36:50.820
in the first degree.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.720
We uncovered
ten ounces of narcotics,

36:53.920 --> 36:56.590
6,000 milligrams
of methadone.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.760
That's a class A-1 felony.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.980
You're looking
at serious time.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.540
What do you want me to do?

37:06.740 --> 37:08.340
Write the letter.

37:08.540 --> 37:10.010
It's gonna show
that you have

37:10.210 --> 37:12.980
some remorse
for your actions,

37:13.180 --> 37:15.210
some empathy
for your victims.

37:15.410 --> 37:16.810
But if you don't,

37:17.010 --> 37:19.480
I will personally make sure
that you're put away

37:19.680 --> 37:21.870
until the day you die.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.620
Hey, hey, wait! This has got
to be some kind of mistake.

37:27.820 --> 37:28.890
Hey, take another step,

37:29.090 --> 37:30.330
and I'm gonna lock you up
for obstructing.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.030
You can't keep me
off the sidewalk.
Try me.

37:32.230 --> 37:33.700
JOHN:
Hey, Franny, I love you.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.230
I-I'll call my dad's attorney.
Just listen to them.

37:35.430 --> 37:37.000
It'll be okay, I promise.
CARMINE: Hey!

37:37.200 --> 37:38.840
What the hell
is going on?

37:39.040 --> 37:40.970
Get your hands off her!
Your daughter's under arrest.

37:41.170 --> 37:43.710
For what?
Should be for that car.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.610
That's my wife's car.
What are the charges?

37:45.810 --> 37:47.660
Falsely reporting an incident.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.110
That can't be right.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.820
She had already
safely stashed the cash

37:52.020 --> 37:53.620
in the car by the time
the fight broke out.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.490
When the cops arrived,
she saw an opportunity.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.290
CARMINE: What are
they saying, Franny?

37:57.490 --> 37:58.960
You tried to hurt me?

37:59.160 --> 38:00.720
It wasn't her,
it was the DiPierros.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.890
We collared two
of their goons an hour ago.

38:03.090 --> 38:04.460
They're the ones
that blew up your car.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.300
They thought you stole
the money 'cause you've been

38:06.500 --> 38:08.030
lying so much.
Sweetie?

38:08.230 --> 38:10.530
Tell me they've got
this thing all mixed up.

38:10.730 --> 38:13.170
Get your hands off me!
You couldn't give me one day.

38:13.370 --> 38:16.770
It's always got
to be about Carmine, right?

38:16.970 --> 38:18.940
So you framed me?

38:19.140 --> 38:20.780
You ruined my wedding day.

38:20.980 --> 38:23.030
And you never even apologized.

38:27.900 --> 38:30.140
DANNY:
Go home.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.340
I got to hand it to you.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.740
Not a lot of people would
do what you're doing.

38:49.940 --> 38:52.960
Well, it's
the right thing to do.

38:54.030 --> 38:56.230
Even if it hurts
your campaign?

38:58.030 --> 39:00.650
Well, I messed up,
I got to own it.

39:00.850 --> 39:03.100
Not a lot of Erin Reagans
in the world.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.840
Well, there aren't
a lot of Jack Boyles, either.

39:07.940 --> 39:11.040
You helped me see
all this clearly.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.530
You know, it's actually
been kind of fun

39:13.730 --> 39:14.870
working with you again.

39:15.070 --> 39:17.600
Well, I don't know
if I would call this fun,

39:17.800 --> 39:20.000
but yeah.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.610
Yeah, we're good together.

39:22.810 --> 39:24.010
That's funny.

39:24.210 --> 39:25.680
You were always so good
at pro bono cases

39:25.880 --> 39:27.110
and I used
to hate them.

39:27.310 --> 39:28.880
(laughs)

39:29.080 --> 39:32.230
Which is why it's funny
which sides we landed on here.

39:34.870 --> 39:37.320
Why don't you
come work for me?

39:37.520 --> 39:38.890
What?

39:39.090 --> 39:40.970
Think of all the people
you could help.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.360
That's not a bad idea.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.750
You'd consider that?

39:51.150 --> 39:54.070
Oh, I'm not
so sure about that.

39:54.270 --> 39:56.260
But thank you.

39:57.820 --> 40:00.610
You reminded me
of all the good that I can do,

40:00.810 --> 40:03.030
whether I win
this election or not.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.490
Still in civvies?

40:14.690 --> 40:16.460
Yeah, thankfully,

40:16.660 --> 40:20.380
they still have respect
for the shield.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.130
Well, we arrested Marco

40:24.330 --> 40:26.170
and two men
who were supplying fentanyl

40:26.370 --> 40:28.640
to multiple dealers
across the city.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.810
Oh, my God.

40:31.010 --> 40:32.840
That's wonderful.
There's more.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.880
Marco wrote a letter
to the D.A.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.910
where he admitted
to selling Vince the drugs.

40:38.110 --> 40:40.080
And he requested

40:40.280 --> 40:43.000
the D.A. drop
all charges against you.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.040
Well, what does that mean?

40:49.340 --> 40:51.160
It means you're free to go.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.930
Really?

40:53.130 --> 40:55.400
That's damn good police work.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.900
(chuckles) Yeah.
Thank you.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.870
But, you know, you can't ever

41:00.070 --> 41:01.840
pull a stunt like that again.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.280
I do not condone
the way you went about it,

41:05.480 --> 41:07.610
even if it did...

41:07.810 --> 41:10.230
work this time.

41:12.830 --> 41:16.200
You know, your grandson
would be real proud of you.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.690
(sniffles, exhales)

41:20.890 --> 41:23.480
Yeah.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.130
CHASE:
Welcome to New York.

41:29.330 --> 41:31.000
We are happy to have you.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.540
<i>Bienvenida a nuestra</i>
<i>vello ciudad.</i>

41:34.740 --> 41:37.070
Welcome,
welcome to New York.

41:37.270 --> 41:39.480
Here you go.
Here you go.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.900
Mr. Mayor?

41:48.330 --> 41:51.520
Frank, I didn't mean for you to
stand in as detail personally.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.910
Oh, I just wanted to see
your show live and in person.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.110
In front of the press,
seriously?

42:04.450 --> 42:06.640
What is this?

42:06.840 --> 42:08.570
That's the bill.

42:08.770 --> 42:10.510
See...

42:10.710 --> 42:13.810
the NYPD offers
a uniformed police presence

42:14.010 --> 42:16.710
at private gatherings,
sporting events,

42:16.910 --> 42:19.630
concerts, you name it.

42:20.430 --> 42:22.670
For a price, of course, so...

42:23.600 --> 42:26.890
...if you want my people
at your show,

42:27.090 --> 42:29.660
you pay for it
like anybody else.

42:29.860 --> 42:32.150
Is this a joke?

42:33.280 --> 42:36.200
Personal checks
and credit cards accepted,

42:36.400 --> 42:39.920
payable within 30 days.

42:42.120 --> 42:45.960
And that isn't a request.
