00:22.021 --> 00:23.857
It's beautiful.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.776
It's the $10 million Nightscape,
after all.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.656
I wish we all could've gotten to see it.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.745
-Yeah.
-That's true.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.875
<i>My locked memories...</i>
<i>started flooding out unchecked.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.005
Kids. Congratulations on graduating.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.468
We had some good times.
We had some sad times.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.847
We had successes and failures.
So much happened.

00:57.557 --> 01:02.187
You may be graduating grade school today,
but there's still much you lack.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.397
That goes for me, too.

01:06.066 --> 01:10.111
But life is about filling
these voids inside of us.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.197
That's my belief.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.784
<i>In my other memory,</i>

01:16.785 --> 01:18.912
<i>Kayo, Hiromi...</i>

01:20.371 --> 01:22.165
<i>and Aya Nakanishi had all been killed.</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:24.793
I could've...

01:25.293 --> 01:27.170
I could've saved them.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.373
<i>That's right.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:13.049
<i>I had a past where I failed.</i>

02:14.425 --> 02:16.511
<i>And this present exists</i>
<i>because I did it over.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:20.765
<i>I've probably lived</i>
<i>the same amount of time twice.</i>

02:57.802 --> 02:58.761
This?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.638
Kumi made this for you.

03:02.974 --> 03:03.808
How long...

03:04.934 --> 03:08.021
have I been asleep?

03:10.648 --> 03:12.066
One year and two months.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.946
It's May...

03:19.657 --> 03:20.617
2005.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.624
Good morning, Satoru.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.045
Stop making me repeat myself, you dummy.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.219
Sorry.

04:20.260 --> 04:25.682
JULY 5TH, 2005 (TUESDAY)

04:39.195 --> 04:43.157
<i>My memory is still in fragments,</i>
<i>with important pieces missing.</i>

04:44.659 --> 04:47.996
<i>I need to get them back</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:56.546
Airi...

05:00.174 --> 05:01.175
Satoru.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.056
I hear your operation was a success, Kumi.

05:08.016 --> 05:08.850
I'm happy for you.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.936
Thanks. I wasn't scared,
because you helped me.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.523
Although, that was over a year ago.

05:16.941 --> 05:17.775
Oh, right.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.529
Oh, thanks for the crane origami.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.114
I was so surprised.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.949
You just collapsed over there.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.330
Are you here for a checkup?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.292
I'm totally fine now,
but they keep treating me like I'm sick.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.336
They told me to stay inside
over my summer break.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.588
I didn't even have plans.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.633
I want to go camping.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.394
Hey.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.481
Was that always yours?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.566
This? It was a gift.

05:59.150 --> 05:59.984
Do you remember?

06:00.568 --> 06:03.237
There was this girl who punched out
some weird camera guy.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.410
Her name is Airi.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.221
Airi...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.127
<i>The moment you awoke,</i>

07:00.336 --> 07:02.338
<i>so did the urge inside me.</i>

07:14.642 --> 07:15.977
Overlapping memories...

07:19.647 --> 07:21.357
Yeah. The memories feel so real.

07:22.567 --> 07:28.531
In the memories where I didn't sleep,
Kayo, Hiromi, and Aya were all murdered.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.618
It's as if I repeated my life.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.414
I see.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.960
I sound crazy, don't I?

07:43.754 --> 07:45.006
Let's assume you're not.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.382
What about the killer?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.010
Were you able to remember anything?

07:49.927 --> 07:50.761
No, not yet.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.057
I can't remember anything
from right before it happened.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.310
I see.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.689
Is there anyone you suspect?

08:02.732 --> 08:03.566
There is.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.027
But I won't tell you.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
You have the right answer
locked inside you.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.242
I don't want to influence you
and risk giving you a false memory.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.037
I'll wait.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.375
By the way...

08:22.502 --> 08:25.880
don't we always have secret meetings
in stairwells?

08:26.631 --> 08:27.632
Do we?

08:28.132 --> 08:29.967
Yeah, we do.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.318
<i>I can't let things end like this.</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:50.863
<i>Hooray, I woke up,</i>
<i>now I'm just going to let it go? No.</i>

08:51.405 --> 08:54.617
<i>I'm going to get back my memories.</i>

08:57.370 --> 09:00.206
COURTESY OF THE NISHIFUNABASHI
CITY COUNCIL

09:02.166 --> 09:05.336
CHIBA CENTRAL HOSPITAL

09:05.419 --> 09:06.254
Mr. Nishizono.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.382
The grant increase we just received
can be directly attributed

09:09.465 --> 09:11.884
to the years
you've spent laying the groundwork.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.932
Sir, perhaps you'd consider entering
either a mayoral or congressional race.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.519
To me, success is...

09:22.562 --> 09:26.440
being involved on the ground level,
somewhere near the everyday citizen.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.694
That's why I don't need any more
than this city.

09:30.987 --> 09:31.904
My ambition...

09:32.822 --> 09:33.906
lies somewhere else.

09:41.330 --> 09:45.084
<i>Meeting Airi helped me recover some</i>
<i>of my memories of the future.</i>

09:48.504 --> 09:50.840
<i>I'd like to see her again.</i>

09:53.467 --> 09:55.177
<i>But how?</i>

10:00.349 --> 10:01.726
How are you? You feeling okay?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.603
Yes.

10:04.061 --> 10:04.895
All right.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.356
Dr. Kitamura.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.697
I'd like to take a trip tomorrow.
Could I have your permission?

10:20.411 --> 10:24.248
In my professional opinion,
I don't think you're ready.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.042
Yes, sir.

10:27.752 --> 10:32.548
But I want to try to find any leads
that will help me recover my memory.

10:44.769 --> 10:48.439
This wasn't my patient...
but there was a track athlete

10:48.522 --> 10:50.066
who broke his leg below the knee.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.528
And so, they decided
to stabilize the break with a rod.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.115
Doctors told him to rest
and recover for two months,

10:58.199 --> 11:00.451
then go through
another four months of rehab

11:00.534 --> 11:03.412
before he would be able
to walk normally again.

11:04.955 --> 11:08.000
But there was a competition coming up
in four months.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.628
He wanted to go.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.757
And so, he threw himself into his rehab.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.469
Oh, of course we stopped him.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.807
Because rushing the rehabilitation process
could risk lingering aftereffects.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.643
Did he make it to the competition?

11:28.562 --> 11:29.980
Your rate of recovery...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.483
is even faster than his.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.027
It defies medical explanation,

11:35.486 --> 11:37.613
and you could say
it's almost supernatural.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.866
<i>So, he didn't make it.</i>

11:41.575 --> 11:45.204
Does that worry you, doctor?

11:46.330 --> 11:47.164
No.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.876
Personally, I have a good idea what it is.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.756
There's this troublesome thing out there

11:55.840 --> 12:00.845
that easily disregards all the hard work
and analysis we do as doctors.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.768
-Do you know what it is?
-No.

12:09.061 --> 12:09.979
Human will.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.148
Human will?

12:12.690 --> 12:13.607
Yes.

12:14.150 --> 12:14.984
That's why...

12:16.777 --> 12:18.988
if you feel like it's okay,

12:19.822 --> 12:20.739
then it probably is.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.117
I'll give you permission.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.079
Thank you very much.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.210
Oh, and by the way,

12:33.752 --> 12:35.129
that track athlete.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
He made it to the competition...

12:38.340 --> 12:39.258
and won.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.829
<i>I'm going to go see her.</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:13.792
<i>I need to move forward with my own feet.</i>

13:26.764 --> 13:30.851
<i>I'm sure my legs still remember</i>
<i>where she is,</i>

13:31.810 --> 13:33.521
<i>and they'll take me to her.</i>

15:30.471 --> 15:31.639
Hey.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.432
Stop.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.017
Wake up!

15:44.360 --> 15:45.194
Oh, you're awake.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.741
Do you know who you are
and why you're here?

15:52.743 --> 15:53.577
Thank goodness.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.997
I live close by.
Why don't you come with me?

15:58.832 --> 15:59.750
Have a seat.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.586
There's no way you killed your mother.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.839
Let me just get you some money, then.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.509
Everything in front of us
is still in progress.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.304
The end is still far into the future,
and nobody knows what it is yet.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.981
<i>Airi.</i>
<i>She was the only one who believed me.</i>

16:24.024 --> 16:25.109
<i>I remember now, Airi.</i>

16:26.652 --> 16:28.654
<i>I remember you were someone important</i>
<i>to me.</i>

17:17.411 --> 17:18.244
Airi.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.249
Airi.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.084
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

17:53.363 --> 17:56.200
The kidnapping and murders
of those young girls in Hokkaido

17:57.326 --> 17:59.495
have all passed
the statute of limitations.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.123
The only one
for which statute of limitations isn't up

18:03.999 --> 18:07.336
is the June 2001 murder in Chiba.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.463
But...

18:11.465 --> 18:13.801
that murder was a little different
from the others.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.678
Nobody has been arrested.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.767
Maybe the police just didn't make it
to the suspect the killer set up.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.688
No. It's hard to imagine
he'd make such a mistake.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.400
Maybe it's simply unrelated.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.452
Satoru? What is it?

18:47.292 --> 18:49.753
Got it. I can bring it by. See you.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.092
What did Satoru want?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.386
He wanted to borrow my graduation book.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.513
I see.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.851
-Well, no sense trying to rush things.
-You're right.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.104
Hey, Young Kobayashi.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.189
Drink with me.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.986
I'm not that young.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.073
Good, Young Kobayashi.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.409
I said, I'm not that young.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.715
-What's wrong, Young Kobayashi?
-Just went down the wrong pipe.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.733
They're doing it again.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
Looks good.

19:58.780 --> 20:03.035
SASANQUA GET TOGETHER

20:22.888 --> 20:23.722
Ms. Sachiko.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.098
Hey there, Kumi.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.059
What do you think about this?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.562
A barbeque and fireworks?

20:31.063 --> 20:34.149
They do it every year.
Did you know about it?

20:34.233 --> 20:37.611
They put the posters up every year
in the Pediatrics wing.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.405
A mixer for the patients.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.034
I've been to this camping site
on a field trip, and it was beautiful.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.996
I think it'd be good for Satoru's rehab.

20:49.039 --> 20:49.873
Right, Satoru?

20:52.668 --> 20:53.794
Satoru.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.425
Weren't you listening?

21:00.884 --> 21:02.427
Let's go do this together.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.306
Looks fun, right?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.185
It does.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.187
Maybe I'll go.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.523
Yes. Let's totally go.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.193
You know, Ms. Sachiko,
you can see Mount Fuji from there.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.654
-Mount Fuji? Really?
-Yeah. You can see Mount Fuji.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.614
Hello.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.784
Hope I'm not intruding.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.537
Here.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.844
<i>Let's all go past the hill</i>

21:44.344 --> 21:48.140
<i>Whistling all the way</i>

21:48.223 --> 21:51.560
<i>The sky is blue and clear</i>

21:52.060 --> 21:54.813
<i>Guiding us to the farm</i>

21:55.355 --> 21:57.190
<i>Let's all sing</i>

21:57.274 --> 21:59.067
<i>A cheerful melody</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:04.323
You must be so happy, Ms. Fujinuma.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.367
Satoru is finally able
to participate this year.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.452
I really am.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.537
I've dreamed of this day.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.524
<i>Oh, how I've dreamed of this day.</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:44.780
<i>Show me, Satoru.</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:50.952
<i>Give me that thrill and exhilaration.</i>
