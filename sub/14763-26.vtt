escape the Destroyer armor?

00:07.572 --> 00:09.279
You left me, trapped.

00:09.327 --> 00:12.466
But a superior mind
always finds a way.

00:12.812 --> 00:16.814
Your communications network,
cables on the ocean floor.

00:16.866 --> 00:18.866
Primitive, but effective.

00:19.365 --> 00:22.988
Now you must submit yourselves
to the Ultron Revolution.

01:20.507 --> 01:24.091
Seeing the Avengers on my side
will subdue the humans.

01:24.163 --> 01:27.498
What you call suffering
will end more quickly.

01:27.626 --> 01:31.099
No dice. We'll always
stand with humanity.

01:31.258 --> 01:35.334

Yeah!

03:08.694 --> 03:10.894
Our attacks aren't
doing much good.

03:12.531 --> 03:14.662
They're rebuilding with
whatever they can find.

03:14.709 --> 03:18.390
It's like Ultron's taken
over the city itself.

03:18.437 --> 03:20.701
Even if we stop these sentries,
there's more out there,

03:20.748 --> 03:22.670
and an army of
mind-controlled Inhumans.

03:22.717 --> 03:23.804
We gotta regroup.

03:23.851 --> 03:27.777
Cap's right. I've got an idea.
Follow me.

03:33.385 --> 03:36.617
We're here to see Dr. Strange.
We have an appointment.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.577
Come inside, quickly.

03:38.624 --> 03:40.754

You're safe here.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.488
We can't stay long,
Dr. Strange.

03:49.535 --> 03:50.831
We just need to make a plan.

03:50.878 --> 03:52.866
I've been monitoring
the situation.

03:52.913 --> 03:56.437
Humans all over the world are
under attack from the Inhumans,

03:56.484 --> 03:59.540
and now Ultron's sentry
reinforcements are arriving.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.642
I expected you to
come for my help.

04:01.689 --> 04:03.744
We could use
a little magic today.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.404
So what do we do?

04:05.451 --> 04:06.814
Ant-Man and I know
how to disable

04:06.861 --> 04:09.374
the Inhuman registration discs.

04:09.421 --> 04:12.344
We just need a lab that
wasn't destroyed by Ultron.

04:12.391 --> 04:13.512
You guys do your thing.

04:13.559 --> 04:14.655
I'll take a team to hold off

04:14.702 --> 04:16.515
the Inhumans
as long as possible.

04:16.562 --> 04:19.625
I have an idea for dealing with
Ultron, but it needs work.

04:19.673 --> 04:22.966
I'll present it to you when...
If it's ready.

04:27.806 --> 04:30.595
He still gives me the creeps.

04:30.642 --> 04:33.365
I know you all know this, but...

04:33.412 --> 04:36.179
If we fail, this is the end
for the human race.

04:36.749 --> 04:38.149

04:50.571 --> 04:53.418
Still in good shape.

04:53.465 --> 04:57.498
I developed the first conceptual designs
for the arc reactor, right here.

04:57.545 --> 04:59.424
The circuitry Ant-Man
and I saw

04:59.471 --> 05:02.146
inside Ultron's registration
discs seemed familiar.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.695
I realized it was mine.

05:03.742 --> 05:05.419
FALCON: How did Ultron
get a hold of it?

05:05.467 --> 05:06.724
I don't know, Falcon,

05:06.787 --> 05:08.776
but it makes me responsible
for what's happening.

Tony, I know you can't
rush genius, but hurry up!

06:08.607 --> 06:11.363
This is it, tweak the code
syntax and it should...

06:11.410 --> 06:13.707
And it should break the link
between Ultron and the Inhumans.

06:13.754 --> 06:16.301
Hulk, I need an Inhuman.

06:16.348 --> 06:18.336

thing for all the Inhumans.

06:47.821 --> 06:49.743
Don't need anyone else
getting hurt.

06:49.790 --> 06:53.814
This should broadcast a signal just
strong enough to reach Inferno.

global satellite network,

07:14.406 --> 07:15.769
insert the code, broadcast it,

07:15.816 --> 07:17.604

that it gets...

We'll find Ultron.

In addition to a new body, I've
picked up some new skills.

Let me guess, he got away.

10:33.655 --> 10:36.262
Pursue him now.
Don't lose him.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.499
I can't find him,
he's masking his signal.

10:38.602 --> 10:40.860
I might be able
to track the vibranium.

You sure about this, Ant-Man?
I don't pick up a thing.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.168
Perhaps your scan was wrong.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.691
Nope, he's here.

11:25.847 --> 11:28.672
I guess I should be impressed
that you tracked me here.

11:39.238 --> 11:43.453
It will superheat the Earth
and destroy all life.

12:14.983 --> 12:16.871
I can't get into

12:16.919 --> 12:19.183
There's some sort of

A sound attack, amplified
by the shield.

14:27.183 --> 14:29.588
The only thing that
will affect vibranium.

14:40.941 --> 14:43.333
This is the end, Ultron.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.393
No, this is your end,

14:45.440 --> 14:49.230
and this planet is about
to become your grave.

14:49.277 --> 14:51.541

14:51.588 --> 14:55.176
And everyone on Earth
is about to be super extinct.

14:55.224 --> 14:58.581
Ant-Man, now would be a good time
to disable that force field.

14:58.628 --> 15:00.174
I can't get through,

15:00.221 --> 15:01.384
but it looks like
the same tech we found

15:01.431 --> 15:03.411
inside the registration discs.

15:03.458 --> 15:07.415
That is logical. Ultron has consistently
based his technology on your work.

15:07.462 --> 15:09.962
Then we should be able to
do something about it.

15:44.366 --> 15:46.732
Time for the big finish.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.647
HULK: Ah!

15:50.001 --> 15:51.401
Ugh!

15:57.612 --> 15:59.334
Tony, you okay?

15:59.381 --> 16:02.070
FALCON:
All I'm getting is vibranium.

16:02.117 --> 16:03.237
Ultron's not here.

16:03.284 --> 16:05.506
Is he in the array?
How about our tech?

16:05.553 --> 16:09.152
Just in time, Stark. If you're done
with your nap we could use a little...

16:09.199 --> 16:10.553
(CAPTAIN MARVEL SCREAMS)

16:10.600 --> 16:12.525
Tony, what are you doing?

16:14.562 --> 16:18.697
(ULTRON'S VOICE)
Finally, I am home.

16:21.629 --> 16:23.057
THOR: Tony!
- No.

16:23.104 --> 16:23.972
CAPTAIN MARVEL: Fight back!

16:24.027 --> 16:25.793
Don't let Ultron control you.

16:25.841 --> 16:29.406
A body even more indestructible
than vibranium...

16:29.453 --> 16:32.988
Because you
will never destroy it.

16:33.036 --> 16:36.762
I have the great Tony Stark
to thank for my creation.

16:36.855 --> 16:40.319
And now I am Tony Stark.

16:40.597 --> 16:44.379
You and I are one.

16:44.426 --> 16:48.091
Your thoughts,
memories, movements,

16:48.138 --> 16:51.327
are just electrical impulses.

16:51.374 --> 16:54.397
The mind, so easily hacked,

16:54.444 --> 16:57.258
<i>so easily defeated.</i>

16:57.305 --> 17:00.003
How do we stop Ultron
without losing Tony?

17:00.050 --> 17:02.374
Maybe we don't.

17:16.824 --> 17:19.042
That better be
who I think it is.

17:19.098 --> 17:21.457
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Dr. Strange?

17:27.683 --> 17:31.192
I've managed to create a space
where technology cannot operate.

17:31.239 --> 17:34.328
It exists halfway between this
world and the dark dimension.

17:34.375 --> 17:35.963
But if we get Stark through it,

17:36.010 --> 17:38.308
Ultron will no longer
be able to control him.

17:38.355 --> 17:40.968
And will have nothing else
to transfer into.

17:41.015 --> 17:42.144
IRON MAN: Listen to him.

17:42.410 --> 17:46.808
Can't stop Ultron alone.

17:46.856 --> 17:49.252
(ULTRON'S VOICE) This is
what you would call irony.

17:49.299 --> 17:53.759
After all these years, I have
become human to defeat you.

17:55.822 --> 17:58.222
Strange, now!

18:11.012 --> 18:12.412
Ah!

18:20.021 --> 18:21.184
BLACK WIDOW:
Where are the others?

18:21.231 --> 18:23.119
DR. STRANGE: They're
safe on the other side.

18:23.166 --> 18:26.074
I can only hold the portal
open for a short time.

18:26.152 --> 18:29.359
But I knew Tony's closest friends
would want to be with him.

18:29.406 --> 18:32.464
This is not over.

18:32.691 --> 18:35.198
I will live.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.972
I am Ultron.

18:38.027 --> 18:40.270
FALCON: Ultron and the arc
reactor both shut down.

18:40.317 --> 18:42.405
But Tony can't live without
the arc reactor.

18:42.452 --> 18:44.019
What do we do?

18:44.074 --> 18:45.574
There's an enchantment.

18:45.676 --> 18:48.311
It may keep Tony alive
through magic but...

18:48.358 --> 18:50.171
He can't leave.

18:50.218 --> 18:53.349
When his arc reactor reboots,
Ultron would take over again.

18:53.396 --> 18:55.554
There must be another way.

18:56.721 --> 19:00.990
(SLOWLY) Can't believe
I'm saying this.

19:01.795 --> 19:04.228
Magic... Now.

19:11.372 --> 19:12.738
Tony?

19:12.806 --> 19:14.438
IRON MAN:
I'm okay...

19:17.660 --> 19:18.691
Now what?

19:18.855 --> 19:20.301
We devise a plan.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.621
Let's figure out how
to get you out of here.

19:22.722 --> 19:25.306
No, you guys have to leave.

19:25.353 --> 19:27.619
Not going anywhere without you.

19:32.393 --> 19:35.917
You have to.
Work with the others.

19:35.964 --> 19:38.986
Rebuild trust between
humans and Inhumans.

19:39.033 --> 19:41.129
There are a lot
of fences to mend.

19:41.183 --> 19:45.168
You wouldn't leave any of us,
we're not going to abandon you.

19:45.215 --> 19:48.902
We all have work to do, I
just have to do it from here.

19:48.950 --> 19:52.375
Tony, you've been the best
friend I've had since...

19:52.422 --> 19:54.235
Well, maybe ever.

19:54.282 --> 19:57.972
I like to think I work
best alone, Cap.

19:58.020 --> 20:02.218
But the truth is, I'm better
because you're my friend.

20:02.265 --> 20:05.791
Tony... I'm not sure we
can do it without you.

20:06.327 --> 20:08.316
Yeah, we're a team.

20:08.363 --> 20:12.153
And there is no better
in all the nine realms.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.988
HAWKEYE:
We'll figure this out.

20:14.035 --> 20:15.298
We're gonna bring you home.

20:15.345 --> 20:17.400
This isn't goodbye forever.

20:17.447 --> 20:19.772
I'll be back...
(ECHOES)

20:31.285 --> 20:33.116
BLACK WIDOW: It's an old
S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

20:33.163 --> 20:35.284
Since Avengers Tower
was destroyed,

20:35.331 --> 20:37.144
this can be our base for now.

20:37.191 --> 20:41.157
HULK: (SIGHING) Not gonna put a lot
of effort into decorating this time.

20:41.204 --> 20:43.993
THOR: It does not seem
right without friend Tony.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.296
No, but we don't have time
to feel sorry for ourselves.

20:47.343 --> 20:50.257
Not when everyone else
is doing their part.

20:50.304 --> 20:53.505
Construction of New Attilan
is already underway.

20:54.342 --> 20:56.439
THOR: <i>And the vibranium
body is safe again.</i>

20:56.486 --> 20:58.265
<i>Hopefully for good.</i>

20:58.312 --> 21:03.204
HAWKEYE: <i>Ultron's robot army,
mostly just a pile of dust.</i>

21:03.251 --> 21:05.982
CAPTAIN AMERICA: <i> And we've got new
Avengers on the ground in New York</i>

21:06.029 --> 21:07.586
<i>restoring peace and order.</i>

21:09.199 --> 21:11.160
You forgot one person.

21:11.230 --> 21:14.090
IRON MAN: Hey, how about
you guys get back to work?

21:14.176 --> 21:16.593
There's a whole world out there
that needs the Avengers.

21:16.632 --> 21:18.094
Is it really him?

21:18.141 --> 21:19.153
Trickery!

21:19.200 --> 21:22.089
No trick. I recalibrated
the comm system

21:22.136 --> 21:24.470
to scan for interdimensional
frequencies.

21:25.406 --> 21:26.746
He's not here, but...

21:26.794 --> 21:28.591
BLACK WIDOW: But, he's here.

21:29.001 --> 21:31.654
IRON MAN: <i>Avengers, Assemble!</i>
