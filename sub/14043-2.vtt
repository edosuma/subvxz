You heard a couple
nut sacks talkin' about
hockey the other day...

00:13.200 --> 00:15.100
This kid.
Kid is a fuckin' stud.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.266
Kid's a fuckin' beauty.
Fuckin' look at this kid.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.333
Fuckin' love this kid.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.433
Kid lights lamp.
Hashtag lamp life.

00:20.466 --> 00:21.466
Eat, sleep, lamp.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.333
Don't give him too much space,
buddy. He'll dangle.

00:23.366 --> 00:25.266
He'll dangle all the fuckin'
way to outer space.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.166
Suck some Martian
titties up there, boys.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.700
Just getting super sloppy
all over our space dinks.

00:29.733 --> 00:31.300
Silky mittens, top
tittens. Ferda boys.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.466
Ferda!

00:32.500 --> 00:33.466
Ferda!

00:33.500 --> 00:36.100
Big roadie to the big city
this weekend, Schmelt.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.266
Do you know
what that means?

00:37.300 --> 00:38.300
Um...

00:38.333 --> 00:39.400
Suckin' city titty, idiot.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.133
Suckin' all that
big city titty, idiot.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.666
All up that big
city slam piece.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.366
Big city slams, idiot.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.133
Big city billet moms.
Big city billet sisters.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.366
Let's get our dinks
sucked on, boys.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
Yes.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.800
Hey, how's school going,
Schmelt?

00:52.833 --> 00:55.166
It's going...
Just kidding.
We don't give a fuck.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.533
Get our pops, Schmelt.

(IMITATING AIR HORN)

01:19.800 --> 01:21.266
How are ya now?
Not so bad.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.300
Good and you?

01:23.266 --> 01:25.166
Not too bad.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.566
Have you shit yourself?
You look like you've got
an awkward boner.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.766
Don't.
Don't what?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.433
Dan?

01:32.466 --> 01:34.233
Did you know that Daryl used
to get boners every morning

01:34.266 --> 01:35.566
in grade nine during
O Canada?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.066
No shit.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.266
Yep. Just

01:39.300 --> 01:42.033
could not get through O Canada
without getting a boner.

01:42.066 --> 01:44.800
Give a young man 30
idle seconds and he's
gonna get a boner.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.366
We talked about this.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.300
Is there something you
want to talk about now?

01:52.566 --> 01:55.033
Well, pitter patter,
let's get at 'er.

01:57.766 --> 02:00.633
Well, I was wondering
if this year we could
skip the birthday party?

02:00.666 --> 02:03.300
Skip your super soft birthday
party? Are you fuckin' high?

02:03.333 --> 02:04.366
Hard no.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.500
DAN: Daryl's super
soft birthday party?

02:06.533 --> 02:10.233
Every year, Daryl's mom used
to throw him these birthday
parties when he was a kid.

02:10.266 --> 02:12.266
Softest birthday party
on planet Earth.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.766
Boy band karaoke, cupcake
decoration station,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.100
charcuterie.

02:16.133 --> 02:20.233
One year, his mom had him
a "Make the world a
better place" party.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.500
One year they dressed
a horse up like a unicorn

02:22.533 --> 02:24.366
and he was never really
the same after that.

02:24.733 --> 02:25.766
It's not funny.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.100
I used to take a lot of
teasing in school for those.

02:28.133 --> 02:30.633
Aw, should I get
you a tissue, Sally?

02:30.666 --> 02:32.733
No, he'll have
one in his purse.

02:32.766 --> 02:34.633
Or maybe his clutch.

02:34.666 --> 02:37.133
Party's happening, Daryl.
You don't fuck with tradition.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.066
DAN: So. The agenda.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.233
After your dust up over
the weekend, safe to assume
you're fighting again?

02:47.266 --> 02:49.500
Co‐rect.
Ten‐four, good buddy.

02:49.533 --> 02:52.266
Well, it's gonna be a busy
week 'cause there's a few
guys walking around town

02:52.300 --> 02:54.300
claiming to be
the toughest guys
in Letterkenny.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.166
I'm the toughest
guy in Letterkenny.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.333
You were the toughest
guy in Letterkenny.
It's been some time.

02:59.366 --> 03:03.100
Now, it's safe to assume that
that title is as important to
you now as it was then?

03:03.133 --> 03:04.700
Does a duck with a
boner drag weeds?

03:04.733 --> 03:06.266
Ten‐four, good buddy!

03:06.300 --> 03:09.500
Then it's safe to assume
that the challengers will
be coming up around the farm,

03:09.533 --> 03:11.700
as that is how you've
conducted business
in the past.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.566
Well, I was never
one for an audience.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.700
All right, let's talk
about the challengers.

03:15.733 --> 03:17.566
First up,
we've got Sled Ted.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.533
Why's he called Sled Ted?

03:18.566 --> 03:22.300
Well, he likes fixin' sleds,
and ridin' sleds,

03:22.333 --> 03:24.366
and talkin' about sleds.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.233
He just really
likes sleddin', boys.

03:26.266 --> 03:29.133
Uh, he beat up a
guy named Basic Jay.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.233
Why's he called Basic Jay?

03:30.266 --> 03:32.033
'Cause he's a fuckin' basic.

03:32.066 --> 03:34.366
DAN: And now he thinks
he's the toughest guy
in Letterkenny.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.633
After that,
we got Rat Ass.

03:36.666 --> 03:37.800
Why's he called Rat Ass?

03:37.833 --> 03:40.400
'Cause he's got a
hairy ass like a rat.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.200
Can confirm.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.600
He beat up a guy
named Brains.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.733
See, his name's Brian
but he spelt it Brain

03:48.766 --> 03:51.166
in the computer at bowling
one time. It just kinda stuck.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.033
DAN: Now he thinks he's the
toughest guy in Letterkenny.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.366
And after that,
we got Joint Boy.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.000
Because he smokes
lots of joints, Dairy.

04:02.066 --> 04:04.433
Well, just plucking
the low hanging fruit
is what that is.

04:04.466 --> 04:07.766
I've seen that guy take
on four bouncers at
the rippers one time.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.566
He is otherworldly.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.433
Got a dome on him like
an Easter Island statue.

04:12.466 --> 04:13.566
Is he single?

04:14.533 --> 04:16.333
Not that it matters,
I guess.

04:16.366 --> 04:21.133
Look, keep it at the
end of the lane way.
No degens on the property.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.666
That's a Texas size 10‐4.
Over and out.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.633
Well, this is annoying.

You're a sniper.
You're a snipe.

You're a skirt,
you pansy.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.500
If you make me walk up
the lane way again,
we're having babies.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.433
Put it out! Put it
out! Put it out!
Fuck!

05:03.466 --> 05:05.200
Fuck!

05:05.233 --> 05:07.200
Those boys need
to give their
balls a tug.

05:07.233 --> 05:09.766
Maybe, check, make
sure they're still
attached right quick.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.500
I'd rather put a mirror down
there and see what's what.

05:12.533 --> 05:13.700
One time,
my cousin...

05:13.733 --> 05:16.500
He tore open his
ball sack trying to
do a skateboard trick

05:16.533 --> 05:18.533
and he had to show
it to his mum.

05:18.566 --> 05:20.466
Was it his scrotal sack?

05:20.500 --> 05:24.066
Well, you know. That dangly
piece of flesh, what hangs
down behind the penis.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.700
Scrotal sack.
The nut sack.

05:25.733 --> 05:28.433
So, he tore his ball
sack open trying to do
a skateboard trick

05:28.466 --> 05:31.766
and he's gots to show it to
his mum because apparently one
of his testicles was showing.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.100
Was it the right one
or the left one?

05:34.133 --> 05:35.633
Why is that
of importance?

05:35.666 --> 05:37.500
Well, because the left
one has more sperm in it.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.000
Spermatozoa is
what it's called.

05:39.033 --> 05:42.200
Tell you what, if I ripped
open my ball sack trying to
do a skateboard trick,

05:42.233 --> 05:43.866
I'd be more worried about
seeing my vas deferens.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.633
Well, you'd have to tear your
ball sack pretty near wide
open doing a skateboard trick

05:47.666 --> 05:49.566
if you wanted to see
your own vas deferens.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.233
I'm not sure I wanna
see my own vas deferens

05:52.266 --> 05:53.766
I think if I saw my
own vas deferens,

05:53.800 --> 05:55.300
I'd be quite worried.

05:55.333 --> 05:59.300
I'd be most worried if I tore
my ball sack open trying to do
a skateboard trick

05:59.333 --> 06:01.566
if I could see my
accessory glands.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.366
Well, you don't want to go
too kooky with accessories
on your truck.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.500
Or your jeep. It's okay
with like, a quad, though,

06:07.533 --> 06:11.200
like my buddy Big T's got
a snorkel kit on his and
that's pretty punk rock.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.566
What's an
accessory gland?

06:12.600 --> 06:15.233
Well, if your vas deferens
is your sperm ducts,

06:15.266 --> 06:18.666
the accessory glands is
what supplies lubricant
to the sperm duct.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.566
I think if I ripped open
my ball sack trying to do
a skateboard trick,

06:21.600 --> 06:24.066
I'd be most worried about
seeing my seminal vesicles.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.366
Oh, like the Florida
State seminal vesicles?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.766
Like the sack that hangs
behind your vas deferens

06:28.800 --> 06:30.300
and contains fructose

06:30.333 --> 06:31.833
which is energy
for the sperm.

06:31.866 --> 06:34.600
Yeah, it's like when you
go in the city there and
they got them charge stations

06:34.633 --> 06:37.333
for the people that
drive the electric cars.

06:37.366 --> 06:39.633
That's pretty much
your seminal vesticles.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.233
I thought it was pretty
funny when I said

06:44.266 --> 06:47.000
Florida State seminal vesicles
and nobody laughed.

Don't come up the property.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.433

07:22.233 --> 07:23.366
Sled Ted's here.

08:45.166 --> 08:47.133
(MUSIC PLAYING)

09:22.433 --> 09:25.633
Geez, Basic Jay must
have been a shit fighter
to lose to that ass‐hat.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.366
I've known Basic Jay
to be a pretty tough dude.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.566
He's not really
a fuckin' basic.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.266
Guess he could
have had a cold.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.700
Or the flu.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.366
Sled Ted had Bigfoot hands.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.100
Yeah, he's a big grimy brute.

09:37.133 --> 09:38.366
Shit fighter, though.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.733
Do you guys remember
the fragrance Brut?

09:40.766 --> 09:42.266
Or Actif Brut?

09:42.300 --> 09:43.733
Yeah.
Yeah, they still
make that.

09:43.766 --> 09:45.233
I always enjoyed
that fragrance.

09:45.266 --> 09:47.600
You can use it to
dry up zits too.

09:47.633 --> 09:51.400
Did you know you can use
shaving cream to get permanent
marker off your hands?

09:51.433 --> 09:53.366
Why wouldn't you
just dip your hands
in the parts cleaner?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.033
Well, most people don't
have a parts cleaner.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.366
Well, most likely Rat Ass
will be your next dude.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.200
I hear that he is a greaser.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.333
Can confirm.

10:02.366 --> 10:04.633
So fuckin' greasy
I almost don't want to.

10:04.666 --> 10:08.533
I saw him with his shirt off,
swimming at the gravel pit
not that long ago.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
His back acne
was extraordinary.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.166
Well, like,
extraordinary how?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.733
Well, like, I thought
about it for a while
after is all.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.566
Well, elaborate,
'cause I'm likely
gonna have to touch it.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.100
Well, like how
it was cultivated.

10:25.133 --> 10:27.233
WAYNE: Well, by not
showering likely.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.300
Likely.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.733
Did you know that men
can wear the fragrance
CK ONE as well as women?

10:31.766 --> 10:33.066
Yeah.
DAN: Yeah.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.733
That's 'cause it's
an unisex fragrance.

10:34.766 --> 10:37.100
It says that right
on the bottle.

10:37.133 --> 10:38.600
But would ya?
Oh, negative.

10:38.633 --> 10:39.633
Me neither.

10:41.366 --> 10:42.366
Would you wear
Gap Dream?

10:45.333 --> 10:46.766
DAN: No!

10:46.800 --> 10:48.733
No, no, Dairy,
that's for girls.

10:48.766 --> 10:49.766
Dairy, that's for girls.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.800
You can't walk around
smelling like pretty girls.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.766
You're not wearing
it right now, are you?

10:56.466 --> 10:59.233
Cologne is too expensive.
I just use sunscreen.

fuckin' all dressed chips.

put some fuckin' clothes on.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.566
Not my forte.
Unfortunate.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.333
Hey, neighbor said
he's not gonna give
us a horse this year.

11:15.366 --> 11:16.900
What?

11:16.933 --> 11:19.333
Well, he said that last year
we returned him and his
breath smelled like alcohol.

11:19.366 --> 11:22.466
Well, it was probably mine.
You could have lit my breath
on fire the next day.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.033
Horse was
half cut though.

11:24.066 --> 11:26.066
He said that he's gonna
give us a donkey.
Nope.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Might be funny.

11:27.533 --> 11:29.600
Gotta be a horse.
You don't fuck
with tradition.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.200
You're really gonna pump
the brakes on a donkey
dressed up like a unicorn?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.366
Oh, I'm stompin'
the brakes.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.533
You put that idea
right through the
fuckin' windshield.

11:35.566 --> 11:38.333
But it's a donkey dressed
up like a unicorn.
Katy!

11:38.366 --> 11:41.566
Well, it's better than
a kick in the pants.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.366
Do you want this to
be the softest birthday
party ever or not?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.466
I want this just
as much as you do.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.433
Well, then find
us a horse.

11:48.466 --> 11:51.066
Please and thank you.
And don't stay out in the
sun too long.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.366
Your skin will
look like an old saddle bag.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.500
Yeah.

11:54.766 --> 11:56.500
(PHONE RINGING)

12:05.133 --> 12:06.500
Hello.

12:06.533 --> 12:07.766
Okay.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.466
End of the lane way.
Don't come up the property.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
Good.

12:20.533 --> 12:21.633
Rat Ass is here.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.666
Keep it standing.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.000
This goes to the
ground, we stand up.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.100
Okay.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.333
This goes to a clinch,

13:00.366 --> 13:01.700
we separate.

13:01.733 --> 13:03.600
Great. Let's go!

13:03.633 --> 13:05.133
All right.
So, hit me.

13:06.466 --> 13:08.500
Fight him or
shut the fuck up.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.600
I'll give you
a free one.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.666
What the fuck is this?

13:12.700 --> 13:14.166
Let's fuckin' do this.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.533
Just fuckin'
square off.

13:39.733 --> 13:41.566
WAYNE: Hey! He's pulling hair,
he's pulling hair.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.266
Break 'em up, break 'em up.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.166
Come on, come on!

13:44.200 --> 13:47.066
DAN: I'm gonna clock
this shitty wolverine.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.166
(YELLING)

13:57.300 --> 14:00.034
Hit me. Come on. I love pain.

14:33.734 --> 14:37.301
Look at the
execution, boys.
Look at the hustle, boys.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.367
Ding.

14:38.401 --> 14:40.234
You guys made
the liquor run,
right?

14:40.267 --> 14:42.867
I was Donny
Drives the car.
I was Nicki Navigates.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.034
But, uh...

14:45.067 --> 14:47.234
We couldn't find a lot
of the stuff on the list.

14:47.267 --> 14:48.734
Yeah.
Like what?

14:49.401 --> 14:50.834
Uh, well...

14:52.067 --> 14:54.701
Uh, there's
ingredients

14:54.734 --> 14:57.234
that I don't think you can
get in Letterkenny.
Yeah.

14:57.901 --> 14:59.767
So, go to the city.

14:59.801 --> 15:01.267
Yeah, but we got practice
in a couple of hours.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.367
We're gonna crush a couple
sandos before, too.

15:03.401 --> 15:04.701
Grab some
nappies, maybe?

15:04.734 --> 15:06.201
We haven't had our
pre‐game naps either.

15:06.234 --> 15:08.934
Nappies are nappies. Ferda.
Ferda.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.667
Well, we need
everything on the list.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.734
So, what drinks do you
need ingredients for?

15:13.001 --> 15:14.934
Uh,

15:14.967 --> 15:17.101
Corebelo Love Potion.

15:17.134 --> 15:19.834
Uh, Purple Passion Punch.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.967
Lemon Gingerini.

15:22.001 --> 15:25.067
Apricot Toblerone Cocktail.

15:25.101 --> 15:27.234
Couldn't find
a Flirtini.

15:27.267 --> 15:30.701
Couldn't find Sparkling
Mango Sorbet Float.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.001
Don't...
Don't know really
what that is.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.067
Well, that's all of them.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.367
Ye... Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

15:38.401 --> 15:40.934
Look, I have about a million
things to do if this is

15:40.967 --> 15:43.634
gonna be the softest
birthday party ever.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.834
If you guys don't get me
everything on the list,

15:45.867 --> 15:48.101
you'll be pulling each
other's horns from now on.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.234

15:51.334 --> 15:52.734

(BOTH GROANING)

15:54.667 --> 15:55.667
So far!

16:08.334 --> 16:10.067
Fuck, was he a beaker.

16:10.101 --> 16:12.101
Like, he would not
stop beaking.

16:12.134 --> 16:13.901
That shit
is the worst.

16:13.934 --> 16:16.001
That was right to stick to
the task at hand, pal.

16:16.034 --> 16:17.267
Keep your trap shut.
Throw bombs.

16:17.301 --> 16:19.934
I wouldn't say shit
if my mouth was
full of it.

16:19.967 --> 16:22.234
I haven't seen that many
hits since Good Charlotte
played Warped Tour.

16:22.267 --> 16:23.367
Yeah, more like...

16:23.401 --> 16:25.034
Not very Good Charlotte.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.301
I always liked NOFX.

16:26.334 --> 16:28.034
YESFX.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.734
Big fuckin' day, Dairy.
Big fuckin' day!

16:30.767 --> 16:32.334
Big fuckin' day!
Ow.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.934
Happy birthday, it's your
special day Dairy.
DAN: Birthday beats!
Birthday beats!

16:34.967 --> 16:38.234
Ow. Oh, that's
not polite, Katy.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.901
You really are a Sally.

16:39.934 --> 16:43.101
That's the most action I've
seen since I gave the dairy
cows' teats a good scrubbin'.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.267
I don't need
to know that.

16:44.301 --> 16:46.101
You're pretty good at
wrestling there, Katy,

16:46.134 --> 16:48.201
and that's what
I appreciates about you.

16:48.234 --> 16:50.234
Is that what you
appreciate about me?

16:50.267 --> 16:52.834
Let's go easy over there,
squirrelly Dan.

16:52.867 --> 16:55.401
Yeah. Oh, hey,
look at you, ground.

16:55.434 --> 16:57.401
So, tell me about
this guy, Joint Boy.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.934
Well, I'm not gonna
sugar coats it for you, Wayne.

16:59.967 --> 17:03.067
This guy looks like an
Australian rugbies player,
chiseled out of stones.

17:03.101 --> 17:06.134
Uh‐oh.
Got legs on him
like tree trunks.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.834
Is that a deciduous tree
or a coniferous tree?

17:08.867 --> 17:11.001
What?
Well, there's a difference.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.967
If we're talking about,
like, a maple tree,

17:13.001 --> 17:14.701
which is thick
and deciduous

17:14.734 --> 17:17.667
or a Christmas tree, which
is thin and coniferous.

17:17.701 --> 17:20.267
Yeah, but both is hards
and mades of woods, right?

17:20.301 --> 17:21.767
There's a difference
is all I'm saying.

17:21.801 --> 17:24.001
What type of tree
is a coconut tree?

17:24.034 --> 17:25.234
It's a palm tree.

17:25.867 --> 17:26.967
How do you know?

17:27.001 --> 17:29.034
Well, like the Internet.
Oh.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.967
Anyways, backs to Joint Boy.

17:31.001 --> 17:32.701
How come I've never
heard of him before?

17:32.734 --> 17:34.234
Oh, he just gots out of jail.

17:34.267 --> 17:36.334
He was arrested for assaults
after he beats the shits

17:36.367 --> 17:38.634
out of a guy for
pushin' up on his sister.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.067
Got this big
entourage of guys,

17:40.101 --> 17:43.101
bald‐headed, bearded dudes
what looks like a whole
bunch of surly uncles.

17:44.934 --> 17:46.167
You think we should
call The Ginger?

17:47.334 --> 17:48.934
Mmm.

17:51.201 --> 17:52.334
No.

17:52.367 --> 17:54.001
DARYL: Why not?
He's tougher than hell.

17:54.034 --> 17:55.267
WAYNE: Yeah, but...

17:58.067 --> 18:00.034
Well, like you heard he
fucked an ostrich, right?

18:02.367 --> 18:03.367
He what?

18:04.967 --> 18:06.034
He fucked an ostrich.

18:06.734 --> 18:08.701
Allegedly.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.967
How does a fella get caught
up in that sort of business?

18:11.001 --> 18:13.934
Well, I guess his cousin

18:13.967 --> 18:16.667
had an ostrich farm

18:16.701 --> 18:18.901
when he thought it
might be fun to fuck one.

18:18.934 --> 18:20.067
Allegedly.

18:20.101 --> 18:22.234
So, he got hard

18:22.267 --> 18:24.634
somehow

18:24.667 --> 18:26.034
and he fucked an ostrich.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.034
That's fucked.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.334
That's a felony.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.334
So, we use him in
emergencies only, then.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.067
I should say.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.967
Dairy. Hey, Dairy.

19:07.001 --> 19:08.734
This one's for you.

19:08.767 --> 19:09.767
Oh.

19:11.134 --> 19:12.701
DARYL: Hey, Joint Boy's here.

19:23.967 --> 19:25.767
Which one of youse is Wayne?

19:29.234 --> 19:30.834
We got some business.

19:35.001 --> 19:37.101
You're interrupting a party
for my best pal

19:37.134 --> 19:39.734
that my little sister worked
pretty hard to put on.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.267
Hold it.

19:44.134 --> 19:46.267
May I sort this out
now, please?

19:47.101 --> 19:48.334
Goddamn right you may.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.701
WAYNE: Thank you.

19:49.734 --> 19:50.734
Don't lose.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.001
You had yourself a scrap
the other weekend at Modean's.

20:09.034 --> 20:11.001
What's it to ya?

20:11.034 --> 20:13.134
You left the dude
pretty banged up.

20:15.267 --> 20:19.101
I heard he kicked a slow
learning fella in the bum
while he was havin' a piss.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.734
Now, that slow learning
fella is my second cousin.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.201
Okay.

20:24.234 --> 20:26.867
Being the toughest
guy in Letterkenny is
important to me.

20:28.201 --> 20:29.767
I'm sure it is
to you too

20:30.701 --> 20:33.801
but we're all hicks here.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.601
And you've done me a favor,
so I'd be willing to shake
your hand and call it a day.

20:43.134 --> 20:45.801
I didn't do you no favors.

20:45.834 --> 20:47.734
'Cause I don't know
who the fuck you are.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.201
We done talking?

22:10.267 --> 22:13.734
You wanna come to a
super soft birthday party?

22:24.701 --> 22:26.701
Happy birthday,
Dairy.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.967
It's really more
for them, ain't it?

22:31.001 --> 22:32.301
What is?

22:32.334 --> 22:33.334
DAN: All this.

22:35.767 --> 22:37.834
No, it's not.
It's cream cheese.
No.

22:37.867 --> 22:38.901
That's cream cheese.

22:38.934 --> 22:40.601
No.
Yeah, that's
cream cheese.

22:41.667 --> 22:42.701
Just go...

22:42.734 --> 22:44.101
Jesus!

22:44.134 --> 22:46.834
You remember they
weren't allowed to have
birthday parties growing up.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.367
They had to go
bucky at mine.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.101
DAN: All they do is go
alls out, don'ts they?

22:51.134 --> 22:52.967
DARYL: That's
a Texas size 10‐4.

22:54.334 --> 22:56.834
You know, if Joint Boy
and his pals hadn't
showed up,

22:56.867 --> 22:59.034
I figure this would have been
the softest birthday ever.

23:00.101 --> 23:03.001
That's a small victory
for you, I suppose.

23:03.034 --> 23:04.534
I was worried.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.101
Thought I might have to get
Stewart and the Skids to come
over here and start

23:07.134 --> 23:09.701
hoovering up that
white powder of theirs.

bit of an edge, am I right?

up a bit of the
schneef in my day.

barnyard schneef?

23:28.867 --> 23:31.034
You ever hoovered schneef
off a sleeping cow's spine?

23:31.067 --> 23:34.167
I've hoovered schneef off
of an awake cow's teat.

I ride him home bareback?

23:47.967 --> 23:49.934
You ever hoovered
library schneef?

23:49.967 --> 23:51.701
I've hoovered schneef
off of the cover of

23:55.967 --> 23:57.967

You can sleep
in my bed.

He'd break your bed.

24:02.267 --> 24:03.834
His dick alone
would break your bed.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.134
I saw that too.
I... Yeah.
