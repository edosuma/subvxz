16:32.792 --> 16:35.792
Like, anywhere in California,
excluding San Francisco.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.417
That was the easiest $100
I’ve ever made with clothes on.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.333
Yeah, I mean, who needs
to sit around a pool all day,

16:40.333 --> 16:41.333
when we could just--wait,

16:41.333 --> 16:42.375
-what’d you just say?
-We can just drink

16:42.375 --> 16:43.792
the free champagne in the room.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.834
That’ll be the most
free alcohol I’ve ever gotten

16:45.834 --> 16:46.834
with my clothes on.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.417
Um, do we need to have a talk?

16:48.417 --> 16:50.667
Shh, they’re making
an announcement.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.250
<i>Attention, passengers,</i>

16:52.250 --> 16:53.291

I don’t know, that’s
cuttin’ it pretty close

16:59.709 --> 17:01.709
for an extra
couple hundred bucks.

17:01.709 --> 17:03.083
DEAN: Nobody’s volunteered.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.083
You wait that out,

17:04.083 --> 17:06.875
you’ll both end up with
vouchers worth twice that.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.041
Do you think they’d throw in

17:08.041 --> 17:10.542
an in-flight magazine where
the Sudoku hasn’t been done yet?

17:10.542 --> 17:12.834
A clean Sudoku page?

17:12.834 --> 17:16.875
I haven’t seen
one of those since 2006.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.000
I mean, the next
flight’s in an hour.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.583
I wouldn’t even have
to take a new anxiety pill.

17:19.583 --> 17:20.500
I just could for fun.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.208
Yeah, and we’d actually have
time to get some chowder.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.250
-Oh, yeah.
-And we could read that

17:23.250 --> 17:24.458
really cool plaque.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.625
Don’t look at him.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.834
Just act disinterested.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.834
There’s some
big people here

17:31.834 --> 17:33.208
who are two-seaters,

17:33.208 --> 17:35.917
and that airline knows it.

clam chowder was invented.

died building it.

-No!

Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.709
with a couple that’s
traveling with a baby

18:02.709 --> 18:04.458

turns on them.

-Yeah.

-He’s fine.
-Ah, that’s gonna leave a mark.

a very full gate.
