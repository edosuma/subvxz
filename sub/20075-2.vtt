WEBVTT

00:02.615 --> 00:06.075
From now on, there'll be no
women committing acts of violence

00:06.081 --> 00:08.521
against women. Make it known.

00:08.527 --> 00:11.524
All I need is one more piece of
evidence and I can clinch this.

00:11.530 --> 00:13.121
You want me to lie for ya?

00:13.490 --> 00:14.908
What's with the photos, Mike?

00:14.914 --> 00:17.588
Stay the fuck away from me! Fuck off!

00:19.896 --> 00:21.338
It was like she knew.

00:21.344 --> 00:23.291
- Knew what?
- What Ferguson did to me.

00:23.297 --> 00:25.718
- How'd she get out?
- You tell me!

00:25.814 --> 00:28.423
- Vera?
- She let Smith out to get to me.

00:28.524 --> 00:30.059
I'm lifting your suspension.

00:30.065 --> 00:32.723
- That's if you want to come back.
- Yes, I do.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.657
She's been playing me this whole time.

00:34.663 --> 00:37.094
- So you'll make a statement?
- Just tell me what to say.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.743
I saw Mike Pennisi today.

00:38.749 --> 00:40.800
Franky, that's a breach of your parole.

00:41.595 --> 00:43.915
Argh! Oh!

00:43.985 --> 00:45.969
Francesca Doyle? We have
a warrant for your arrest

00:45.975 --> 00:47.305
for the murder of Michael Pennisi.

00:47.311 --> 00:49.424

may be given as evidence.

01:49.422 --> 01:50.902
What would you know?

01:54.086 --> 01:55.375
Attention, all staff.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.858
Available officer to
Admissions for escort.

03:05.509 --> 03:06.968
Take off your jewellery.

03:30.979 --> 03:32.189
Come on.

03:35.709 --> 03:38.220
Really hoping it was a
different Francesca Doyle.

03:38.226 --> 03:39.832
Yeah, well I'm one of a kind.

03:39.838 --> 03:41.909
You haven't lost your
sense of humour, then.

03:41.949 --> 03:44.422
Guess not, just everythin' else.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.366
There's a spare bed in H1,

03:47.372 --> 03:49.373
- if you wanna move back in there.
- No, I'm not takin' Red's cell.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.099
It's not right. Can you
put me somewhere else?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.119
- I'd rather not be in H1.
- Why?

03:54.386 --> 03:55.901
Just better that way.

03:56.299 --> 03:57.499
Right.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.450
Well go on, just say it.

04:00.456 --> 04:03.231
- I blew it. I'm a disappointment.
- Look, you worked your arse off to

04:03.237 --> 04:05.340
get out of here. I just really
thought you'd make it, Franky.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.629
Yeah, well so much for your
precious fuckin' system.

04:07.635 --> 04:10.239
- The system didn't murder Pennisi.
- Neither did I!

04:10.245 --> 04:11.877
It's not like you can fuckin' talk.

04:11.883 --> 04:14.485
You were out of here and the
system dragged ya back in.

04:15.008 --> 04:16.726
It's got you by the balls.

04:28.457 --> 04:29.663
Uh.

04:36.202 --> 04:38.899
Franky couldn't have killed
Mike Pennisi. You know her.

04:38.905 --> 04:40.499
Yeah, it is hard to believe.

04:40.505 --> 04:42.046
He just saw her once at a cafe.

04:42.052 --> 04:43.811
- That was it. It wasn't her fault.
- Okay, well, either way,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.067
you need to keep your distance,

04:45.073 --> 04:46.964
- for your own sake.
- She'd be feeling frightened

04:46.970 --> 04:48.544
- and isolated. Vera, I've got to...
- If... Bridget...

04:48.550 --> 04:50.854
- She needs me.
- Bridget! There are already rumours

04:50.860 --> 04:53.454
circulating about your relationship.
You know Department policy

04:53.460 --> 04:54.991
- about staff being involved...
- I know I'm compromised,

04:54.997 --> 04:57.211
- but I will not abandon her.
- I understand.

04:57.312 --> 04:58.881
But if anyone sees you...

05:00.387 --> 05:01.710
You're a friend.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.063
You do great work with the women.
I'd hate to have to sack you.

05:07.501 --> 05:11.175
As your friend, be very, very careful.

05:11.699 --> 05:14.290
- Please.
- Yes, Governor.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.306
We didn't have this conversation.

05:20.179 --> 05:22.877
Hey, hey, hey! Pass it! Hey,
Novak, throw it this way.

05:23.078 --> 05:25.804
Chocolate pomegranate cloud cake.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.217
- This one is it?
- Hey!

05:27.223 --> 05:30.732
- Hey, hey, hey, watch out! Yeah.
- Watch out for Bea!

05:31.179 --> 05:34.559
Hey, boys! I smell fresh meat.

05:34.565 --> 05:37.385
- Ooh, come to Daddy! Yeah.
- It's like a pussy buffet.

05:37.391 --> 05:38.903
It's a pussy buffet.

05:38.909 --> 05:41.026
- All we can eat.
- Whoo!

05:41.506 --> 05:43.782
Leave 'em alone, Juice.

05:54.582 --> 05:55.956
No?!

05:55.962 --> 05:58.670
Jeez, it's Franky. Franky! Oh, my God,

05:58.676 --> 06:01.862
- she's gonna make everything better!
- This isn't good, Boomer.

06:01.868 --> 06:03.472
I love you!

06:05.307 --> 06:06.611
I love you, Franky!

06:06.617 --> 06:09.521
Oh, she's gonna sort everything
out, no fucking worries, eh?

06:10.689 --> 06:12.486
Hey! Look out.

06:12.492 --> 06:15.584
Franky's back. Now you're gonna
see what a real top dog's like.

06:15.682 --> 06:17.389
Hey, aren't they, Franky?

06:18.807 --> 06:20.495
I don't think she heard me.

06:20.992 --> 06:23.226
Booms, just make sure
you give her some space.

06:23.232 --> 06:24.504
Yeah, don't smother her.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.978
I just want things to be back to normal.

06:26.984 --> 06:29.300
Come on, Booms, what's
normal around here?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.709
- Okay, well, back to un-normal then.
- Yeah.

06:31.715 --> 06:32.989
Well, where is she?

06:33.790 --> 06:35.088
Franky?

06:45.949 --> 06:48.143
Ah, come here, ya big lug.

06:48.149 --> 06:50.435
- Ha-ha-ha-ha, you scrawny bitch!
- Hey!

06:51.222 --> 06:53.347
- Love you.
- You couldn't stay away, could ya?

06:53.565 --> 06:57.255
- She missed us too much, obviously.
- Hey, what's with the scarf?

06:57.261 --> 06:59.404
- Hey, good to see ya. It's not good
- Yeah.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.229
You're back in here,
but you know what I mean.

07:01.235 --> 07:02.435
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:02.831 --> 07:04.031
Yep.

07:04.339 --> 07:07.747
- Franky. Hey.
- Hey, Dors!

07:07.753 --> 07:09.042
How's that arse, eh?

07:09.048 --> 07:11.661
- Oh, there it is. There's your arse!
- Arrgh!

07:12.714 --> 07:14.487
Did you break parole or somethin'?

07:14.493 --> 07:16.703
Ah, it's a long story, but the
cops reckon I murdered someone.

07:16.709 --> 07:19.127
- Bullshit. Like who?
- Yep.

07:19.133 --> 07:21.838
- Mike Pennisi. Yeah, only
- TV guy you threw oil on?

07:21.844 --> 07:23.119
I didn't kill him, so...

07:23.125 --> 07:24.961
Oh, well, that's fucked then, isn't it?

07:24.967 --> 07:27.830
- Nah, it's okay. I won't be here long.
- Oh, still,

07:27.836 --> 07:30.025
- you should be in with us, not...
- Yeah.

07:30.031 --> 07:32.200
- It's Red's cell. I couldn't.
- You can have mine.

07:32.990 --> 07:34.744
I'm being transferred to Barnhurst.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.204
Why, what's happening?

07:36.298 --> 07:38.744
Chemo, for breast cancer.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.244
- Oh, Maxie!
- Yeah, but that

07:40.250 --> 07:42.910
Barnhurst, like, isn't
forever, but, so...

07:42.916 --> 07:46.535
Hey, ah, when you gonna
make your move for Top Dog?!

07:46.541 --> 07:48.134
- Booms, give a girl a break, eh?
- Yeah, just...

07:48.140 --> 07:49.393
just let her settle in a bit, love.

07:49.399 --> 07:50.697
- No, no, no. Nah,
- Yes!

07:50.703 --> 07:53.183
We gotta... we gotta get
Ferguson for what she done to Bea.

07:59.452 --> 08:01.032
Will, mate.

08:02.077 --> 08:04.578
- Jake.
- Great to have you back.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.290
You sure about that?

08:10.140 --> 08:13.493
Oh, shit. No, mate, I'm
just keeping your seat warm.

08:13.499 --> 08:16.128
Seriously, the sooner you get
reinstated the better, I reckon.

08:16.134 --> 08:18.819
Have to get through the psych
session with Bridget first.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.466
- It's a waste of fuckin' time.
- Yeah, right.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.063
Well, soon as you get the all-clear,
it's yours again. No worries.

08:25.545 --> 08:26.922
Anyhow, ah...

08:27.842 --> 08:30.664
here's to a clean slate,
eh? No hard feelings.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.277
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

08:41.283 --> 08:43.479
Phones are now available for use.

08:50.345 --> 08:52.090
So, you're Franky Doyle.

08:52.276 --> 08:54.487
- And what's it to you?
- Hi...

08:54.573 --> 08:56.494
- I'm Kaz.
- Mm.

08:57.479 --> 09:00.310
Apparently you're going to give
me lessons in how to be a top dog.

09:00.576 --> 09:02.058
Oh...

09:02.064 --> 09:04.704
so this is the bit where you cock
your leg and spray in the corner.

09:05.499 --> 09:06.709
You're funny.

09:07.092 --> 09:08.500
No, just, um,

09:08.506 --> 09:11.265
courtesy call to see if you and
I are going to have any problems.

09:11.271 --> 09:14.635
I'd rather suck dick than be
Top Dog again. It's all yours.

09:15.046 --> 09:16.354
Just passing through.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.352
Not if you murdered someone, you're not.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.657
See ya round.

09:24.434 --> 09:25.634
Allie?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.822
Sit down.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.072
You all right?

09:33.493 --> 09:34.804
I'll live.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.493
I know why you did it.

09:37.509 --> 09:39.800
But I said no one's to touch Ferguson.

09:40.141 --> 09:43.752
You know I am pushing shit uphill
to get these women to listen to me,

09:43.758 --> 09:47.127
especially about bashing each
other. So, why would you do that?

09:47.133 --> 09:49.260
It's undermined everything
I'm trying to do?

09:49.266 --> 09:53.314
Can't you see how screwed up that
is? You're protecting Ferguson?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.390
I am protecting the women, not Ferguson,

09:55.396 --> 09:57.244
and the principle has to
be the same for everyone,

09:57.250 --> 10:00.082
- including my friends.
- Oh, fuck your principles, Kaz.

10:00.088 --> 10:01.374
Just do what's right.

10:01.445 --> 10:02.648
Allie?

10:05.812 --> 10:07.332
Don't touch her again.

10:07.338 --> 10:09.444
Or what? You're gonna bash me?

10:17.309 --> 10:18.554
Hey.

10:19.023 --> 10:20.742
I just heard about the chef.

10:22.112 --> 10:23.929
Good news travels fast.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.607
Are you okay?

10:27.453 --> 10:29.104
I'm not here to make friends.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.674
Okay.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.560
It's nothin' personal.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.973
Look, I... I just
wanted to say thank you

10:35.979 --> 10:39.473
for looking out for me in hospital.
For someone I didn't know, you...

10:39.479 --> 10:42.159
Yeah, well, Red thought
you were pretty spesh, so.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.667
What were you doing in Medical, anyway?

10:45.673 --> 10:48.696
My own stupid fucking
fault. I took on Ferguson

10:48.702 --> 10:50.929
- without thinking it through.
- That's gutsy.

10:50.935 --> 10:53.337
No, was fuckin' pathetic. Really.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.031
Next time, I'm gonna
do the job properly.

10:58.037 --> 10:59.641
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.527
It's the least I can
do. Bea died for me.

11:02.533 --> 11:05.636
No, a psycho bitch stuck a shiv
in her. It's not your fault.

11:05.642 --> 11:07.237
Bea thought that I was dead.

11:09.047 --> 11:12.064
She went out there to
kill Ferguson, for me.

11:13.454 --> 11:16.668
Now I'm gonna kill Ferguson, for her.

11:16.950 --> 11:21.075
Yeah, well, from experience,
you can't win against Ferguson.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.225
You'll either spend the
rest of your life in here

11:23.231 --> 11:24.949
or you end up dead, like Bea.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.203
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.147
All women to report to
assigned work duties.

11:33.711 --> 11:36.235
- Oh, he's back.
- Hello, ladies. Hi, Liz, Dors.

11:36.241 --> 11:37.717
- Hi, Mr Jackson.
- How are you?

11:37.812 --> 11:40.549
- You okay?
- I'm good. Hey, Booms.

11:40.727 --> 11:42.713
We were wondering where you were.

11:42.719 --> 11:44.389
I was hoping that you'd quit.

11:44.395 --> 11:45.953
You need any washing done, Mr J?

11:45.959 --> 11:48.254
Just drop your bras
and knickers off later.

11:49.429 --> 11:53.264
Can't help noticing Mr Stewart's
nicked your job. What happened?

11:54.162 --> 11:55.362
Ooh,

11:55.368 --> 11:57.604
you must have done somethin'
pretty bad to deserve that.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.492
- What'd you do?
- Just get to work, Proctor.

12:00.407 --> 12:02.297
I'd quit while you were ahead.

12:03.151 --> 12:05.068
But you can't, can you?

12:05.442 --> 12:07.876
'Cause you've got nothing else.

12:17.295 --> 12:18.990
- Franky.
- Hey!

12:18.996 --> 12:22.105
They can't seriously think that
you did anything to Mike Pennisi.

12:22.111 --> 12:24.462
I mean, you only saw that
guy once, at the cafe.

12:27.269 --> 12:29.059
Oh, baby.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
- I told you not to go near him.
- Look, I thought

12:31.726 --> 12:33.136
the cafe was an accident,

12:33.142 --> 12:35.416
and then he kept ringin'
me and he sent photos of us,

12:35.422 --> 12:37.003
you and me, at home.

12:37.009 --> 12:38.611
He was stalkin' me.

12:39.915 --> 12:41.705
Why didn't you tell me this?

12:41.711 --> 12:43.580
I couldn't. I was tryin' to protect ya.

12:43.586 --> 12:44.790
From what?!

12:44.876 --> 12:48.024
- Fuck, look where the fuck we are now!
- Just, Gidge, chill.

12:48.030 --> 12:52.023
Really, it's gonna be okay. It
has to be. I didn't do anything.

12:52.029 --> 12:53.858
Okay, well, I'm not
gonna take any chances.

12:53.864 --> 12:55.913
I've hired Marcus
Pearce to represent you.

12:55.919 --> 12:58.231
- He costs a fortune.
- You know how the system works.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.722
You only get what you pay for.

13:02.729 --> 13:04.174
I didn't do anything.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.082
Okay. All right.

13:09.493 --> 13:11.383
Well, well. Well, well, well.

13:12.227 --> 13:14.537
Like ships in the night, huh?

13:15.032 --> 13:18.313
You have got no idea how much it
gladdens my heart to see you back.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.721
- Mm.
- All of my career

13:19.727 --> 13:22.197
I've maintained that the
offender rehabilitation program

13:22.203 --> 13:24.243
is a complete waste of taxpayers' money.

13:24.422 --> 13:27.162
One cannot deny the animal within.

13:27.168 --> 13:29.072
No, they can't, can they?

13:30.450 --> 13:32.695
- Ha.
- Hm.

13:32.727 --> 13:34.963
Looking forward to seeing
your criminal instincts

13:34.969 --> 13:36.896
- aroused.
- Oh, well, don't hold your breath.

13:36.902 --> 13:38.706
Go mind-fuck someone else.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.325
Come on, you can do better than that.

13:56.790 --> 13:59.953
I want the record to reflect that
my client has voluntarily agreed

13:59.959 --> 14:02.063
- to this DNA sample.
- Noted, Mr Pearce.

14:02.069 --> 14:04.158
Told you, you won't
find my DNA in his house.

14:04.164 --> 14:06.305
My client didn't enter
the premises at any time.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.367
Good. Then we can exclude
her from the crime scene.

14:08.373 --> 14:10.015
- It should help your case.
- If it was a crime.

14:10.021 --> 14:12.750
- He could have shot himself.
- Not from three metres away.

14:13.021 --> 14:16.067
In the meantime, we have your client's
phone and internet records here

14:16.073 --> 14:18.177
and there are a couple of
things we'd like you to clear up.

14:18.183 --> 14:20.458
- Ms Doyle, I suggest...
- Sure, I want to clear this up.

14:21.022 --> 14:23.021
If you're not sure, 'I don't recall'

14:23.027 --> 14:24.777
is a perfectly acceptable response.

14:24.783 --> 14:26.422
Now, you claim that Pennisi was stalking

14:26.428 --> 14:28.737
- you and called you several times.
- That's right.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.344
But there's no record of any
calls from his phone to yours.

14:31.350 --> 14:34.055
Yeah, but he did call
me, two or three times.

14:34.061 --> 14:36.827
Come on, Detective. He could
have used a prepaid mobile. Th...

14:36.833 --> 14:38.514
- this doesn't mean anything.
- Possibly.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.640
You also conducted an internet search

14:40.646 --> 14:42.498
for his details on
the day of the murder.

14:42.504 --> 14:45.210
Yeah, so I could go over and
tell him to stop hassling me.

14:45.216 --> 14:47.453
And that's when you say
he attacked you in the car.

14:47.459 --> 14:49.969
- Yeah. A chef's one.
- With a blowtorch.

14:50.184 --> 14:51.390
Okay.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.283
Did you feel threatened?

14:54.289 --> 14:57.183
My client has already told
you, she feared for her life.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.772
He was a fuckin' lunatic.

14:58.778 --> 15:02.342
Yes, possibly, but I don't see
any calls to the police or 000

15:02.348 --> 15:05.270
on your phone records after
you say he attacked you.

15:06.048 --> 15:07.248
Nup.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.051
No.

15:09.869 --> 15:12.022
We couldn't find any
blowtorch at the house,

15:12.028 --> 15:14.123
but we did find something
else of interest.

15:14.129 --> 15:15.528
Francesca...

15:15.707 --> 15:17.796
have you ever seen this firearm before?

15:21.103 --> 15:23.582
Don't answer that, Ms
Doyle. What the hell is this?

15:23.588 --> 15:25.228
The murder weapon.

15:32.613 --> 15:34.499
Francesca, do you recognise it?

15:38.261 --> 15:40.778
Nup. Never seen it before.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.604
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks, Don.

15:48.278 --> 15:51.488
Oh, God. Bloody awful.

15:54.069 --> 15:55.269
Righto.

16:09.357 --> 16:11.867
Liz. Come on in.

16:11.873 --> 16:13.353
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

16:13.359 --> 16:15.178
What's been happening in Liz's world?

16:17.381 --> 16:20.561
I'm afraid my world's pretty
shit at the moment, Don.

16:21.588 --> 16:23.808
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, what's happened?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.707
You... you would have
heard about the woman

16:25.713 --> 16:27.034
- that was killed, right?
- Mm.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.335
That was Bea, and, uh...

16:29.341 --> 16:32.131
she was a really... she was a really
good friend of mine, and, uh...

16:34.109 --> 16:36.134
Another friend has cancer.

16:36.347 --> 16:38.409
And Franky... oh, God.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.300
She was one of the girls out on
parole. She's just come back in.

16:41.628 --> 16:45.740
So yeah, it's pretty
much the worst week ever.

16:45.746 --> 16:48.573
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
Liz. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:48.579 --> 16:51.270
And you know Franky is, ah...

16:51.276 --> 16:54.107
so smart and so capable.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.202
It terrifies me 'cause I think
if she can't make it out there,

16:57.208 --> 16:59.186
what hope have I got?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.498
You've got people who
care about you, Liz.

17:02.183 --> 17:03.796
Don't you forget that.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.400
Okay?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.645
- Thanks.
- Let's get you out of here

17:09.651 --> 17:11.723
- first, though, hey?
- Yeah.

17:12.261 --> 17:14.624
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

17:14.630 --> 17:16.935
So, I've brought the statement
along for you to sign.

17:16.941 --> 17:19.590
Right. Oh, wow.

17:20.029 --> 17:22.255
- God, did I... did I say all that?
- Mm.

17:22.261 --> 17:23.840
You don't expect me
to memorise all that,

17:23.847 --> 17:26.348
- do you? Right.
- No, no, jus... just the bullet points.

17:26.510 --> 17:30.760
Okay? So do you want to read through
it again together, before you sign?

17:30.766 --> 17:33.127
No. Looks like it's all here.

17:33.398 --> 17:34.598
Yeah.

17:35.014 --> 17:36.486
- This one?
- Yep.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.758
Right.

17:46.727 --> 17:48.711
Ooh! Ugh!

17:49.435 --> 17:50.638
Ugh!

17:51.516 --> 17:52.851
Ooh! Ugh-ugh!

17:58.248 --> 17:59.896
Must've been bad news.

18:11.136 --> 18:13.902
- Cops get something on ya?
- Ugh!

18:13.908 --> 18:15.324
What are we, best friends now?

18:15.330 --> 18:17.701
Well, to be honest, kinda
looks like you need one.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.293
- Ugh!
- Right.

18:23.910 --> 18:26.014
Murder weapon's turned up. It's a gun.

18:28.818 --> 18:30.898
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

18:30.904 --> 18:32.948
- If you didn't do it?
- Yeah, I wish.

18:32.954 --> 18:35.123
Just tell the cops you
never seen it before.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.653
Oh, shit.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.229
You have seen it before.

18:42.128 --> 18:43.938
Busted one of my clients with it.

18:43.944 --> 18:46.051
I chucked it. Now it's turned up again.

18:47.263 --> 18:50.021
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know. I don't get it.

18:50.034 --> 18:52.956
- Does anyone else know about the gun?
- Nah, just him.

18:52.962 --> 18:54.562
Could he have followed
you to where you dumped it?

18:54.568 --> 18:56.384
Well, maybe, but he's not a killer.

18:56.390 --> 18:58.974
Yeah, still, he might know something.

18:59.942 --> 19:01.596
He's Ferguson's godson.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.278
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:04.284 --> 19:06.363
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

19:06.369 --> 19:07.978
The canteen is now open for D block.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.493
Franky, you gotta talk to this kid.

19:09.499 --> 19:11.455
Th-that can't be a coincidence.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.015
Fuck!

19:14.021 --> 19:18.192
So, Helen came over for a drink.
She tried to blackmail her.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.080
She wanted money, so Sonia
choked her with a belt.

19:21.086 --> 19:24.012
Oh, shit, Don, sorry.
I left out the bottle.

19:24.018 --> 19:26.595
She whacked her over the
head with a wine bottle,

19:26.601 --> 19:28.560
- then she strangled her.
- Good.

19:28.566 --> 19:30.061
- Yeah.
- Okay. Then?

19:30.067 --> 19:32.984
Oh, God, yeah, then... then
she shaved Helen's head.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.134
I'm useless at this. I...

19:38.140 --> 19:39.928
- They're gonna bust me for sure, Don.
- Liz.

19:39.934 --> 19:42.574
Liz, you're going to be fine, okay?
Just stick to the bullet points.

19:42.580 --> 19:43.949
You will be fine.

19:43.963 --> 19:45.658
I could write it on the back of my hand.

19:45.664 --> 19:47.817
I don't reckon the
judge'd mind, would he?

19:48.417 --> 19:50.352
What happens if I stuff up?

19:50.516 --> 19:55.118
Liz, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be great, okay?

19:55.124 --> 19:57.442
Can I take the notes so
I can learn 'em at night?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.390
No. Too risky.

19:59.396 --> 20:01.814
No, well, that's the only way
I'm gonna remember what to say.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.381
And besides, it's no riskier
than coming here to meet you.

20:04.387 --> 20:06.074
But not as enjoyable.

20:08.296 --> 20:11.052
I'll be careful, I promise.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.356
I don't want anything happening to you.

20:17.028 --> 20:18.976
I'll guard it with my life.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.741
Look, I'm not a headcase.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.577
I just dropped an E at a club.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.311
So, you do want to be Deputy again?

20:35.318 --> 20:36.704
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

20:36.710 --> 20:38.898
Well, sometimes we self-sabotage

20:38.904 --> 20:42.093
because we don't actually
want something or...

20:42.209 --> 20:44.312
we don't believe we deserve it.

20:44.390 --> 20:45.998
No, none of that.

20:46.004 --> 20:47.897
How long have you been at Wentworth now?

20:47.903 --> 20:49.412
About six years.

20:49.787 --> 20:52.701
You must really believe in what
you do to be here that long.

20:52.707 --> 20:55.818
Well, you have to, don't you?
But sometimes you fail people.

20:56.028 --> 20:57.828
Anyone in particular?

21:00.127 --> 21:01.327
Bea Smith?

21:04.316 --> 21:05.807
Yeah, I failed her.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.176
We all did, all of us.

21:09.472 --> 21:11.158
You don't think she belonged in here?

21:11.883 --> 21:13.490
That's not my call.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.355
But if the system
didn't chew her up, she

21:17.739 --> 21:19.738
might have been able to have a, um...

21:26.569 --> 21:29.088
Maybe you're a compulsive rescuer.

21:29.684 --> 21:32.522
No. I just want to make
sure the women get a fair go.

21:37.809 --> 21:39.699
How's that for a headcase?

21:45.207 --> 21:46.407
Hi.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.817
Jesus Christ, Franky.

21:51.673 --> 21:53.394
How can this happen to you?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.200
Well, I was tryin' to help someone out,

21:55.400 --> 21:58.096
someone who I thought
had a bit of a shit start.

21:58.809 --> 22:01.415
- That's not right.
- Mm.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.454
No matter how much you
help some people out,

22:03.460 --> 22:05.518
they keep makin' dumb-arse decisions.

22:09.932 --> 22:11.543
I hope you haven't.

22:11.549 --> 22:13.142
What? What are you talkin' about?

22:13.148 --> 22:15.718
That item I took from
you outside the court...

22:15.929 --> 22:18.185
it was used on someone the other day.

22:19.287 --> 22:20.781
That's fucked up!

22:20.787 --> 22:22.762
So what, you didn't follow
me and watch me dump it?

22:22.768 --> 22:24.006
Are you for real?

22:24.012 --> 22:26.077
I wanted to be far away
from it as possible.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.184
You were the only
person who knew I had it.

22:28.190 --> 22:29.910
Are you fuckin' serious, Franky?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.302
The fuck are you talkin' about?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.315
I thought I came here
because you needed my help.

22:33.321 --> 22:34.807
Yeah, all right.

22:35.392 --> 22:38.191
Fuck, I'm sorry. I don't
really think you did it.

22:38.197 --> 22:40.502
I just don't know how
this is even possible.

22:40.508 --> 22:42.023
Where'd you get it from?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.198
Hole in the wall at Aunty Joan's place.

22:45.204 --> 22:47.987
Why does it always lead back
to Joan fuckin' Ferguson?!

22:47.993 --> 22:50.115
I didn't tell anyone, though, I promise.

22:50.121 --> 22:51.615
And you know I didn't use it.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.834
Yeah, but she still
managed to get to Jesper.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.419
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

22:55.425 --> 22:57.043
H Block are now called for lunch.

22:57.049 --> 22:59.801
That's it. Whoever killed Jesper for her

22:59.807 --> 23:01.957
killed Pennisi and set me up for it.

23:15.940 --> 23:17.140
Hey.

23:22.711 --> 23:24.313
Oh, hello, Doyle.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.709
- What an unexpected pleasure.
- I'm onto you.

23:27.891 --> 23:29.601
You're never gonna get away with it.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.998
Doyle.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.882
It has been so...

23:36.133 --> 23:38.416
pedestrian around here without you.

23:38.422 --> 23:40.832
You had Jesper killed. I know it.

23:40.838 --> 23:44.351
Oh, come on, just knowing
something in your waters doesn't

23:44.357 --> 23:46.521
really satisfy the burden
of proof now, does it?

23:46.527 --> 23:48.074
- You should know that.
- And you've used the same person

23:48.080 --> 23:49.977
to set me up for Pennisi's murder.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.935
Yes, I saw your friend on
the news. That's very sad.

23:52.941 --> 23:54.214
You sick fuck.

23:54.220 --> 23:55.785
Don't tell me they think it was you.

23:55.791 --> 23:57.017
It'll never stick.

23:57.023 --> 23:58.926
You're just a little
bit worried it might.

23:59.989 --> 24:03.209
And so is your sapphic psychologist.

24:03.496 --> 24:05.621
You might be in for
a bit of a dry patch.

24:06.396 --> 24:08.106
Go Franky! Smash her!

24:08.112 --> 24:09.794
Doyle, let her go!

24:09.800 --> 24:12.042
And fuck you for Bea.

24:12.677 --> 24:14.639
That's it, there she is.

24:15.142 --> 24:17.441
There's the old Franky Doyle.

24:17.447 --> 24:18.774
Doyle.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.487
You're fuckin' lucky I'm not the old me.

24:33.276 --> 24:35.439
Ferguson knows who killed Mike Pennisi.

24:35.445 --> 24:36.843
Oh, excellent.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.445
Then all we have to do
is ask her for a name.

24:39.539 --> 24:42.055
It was the same person
who shot Jesper for her.

24:42.061 --> 24:44.064
And you seriously think
she's trying to frame you?

24:44.070 --> 24:46.752
Yeah, she's made an art form
out of fuckin' up people's lives.

24:46.758 --> 24:48.325
She framed me for Harry Smith.

24:48.662 --> 24:51.053
Wh-what do you expect me
to do with this information?

24:51.059 --> 24:52.547
Well, you could check her recent calls

24:52.553 --> 24:54.537
and see who she's been speakin'
to and I can get my lawyer

24:54.543 --> 24:55.849
- onto it.
- It is not the Department's role

24:55.855 --> 24:58.131
to go on fishing
expeditions for inmates.

25:02.006 --> 25:04.056
- But I'll look into it.
- I need to know now.

25:04.062 --> 25:05.642
I will look into it!

25:10.293 --> 25:13.541
Doyle? Next time, keep
your hands off Ferguson.

25:13.547 --> 25:14.945
What's it to you?

25:17.348 --> 25:20.107
Ferguson's obviously got
someone on the outside.

25:22.010 --> 25:23.983
- When's your board meeting?
- It's this afternoon,

25:23.989 --> 25:25.919
and I am not looking forward to it.

25:30.090 --> 25:32.090
What's with Vinegar Tits?

25:32.096 --> 25:34.662
It's not like she hasn't been
dicked around by Ferguson.

25:34.668 --> 25:36.161
Governor Bennett.

25:36.770 --> 25:39.509
After Bea's death, she won't be
sticking her neck out for anyone.

25:39.515 --> 25:40.894
Yeah, I got that.

25:41.181 --> 25:43.198
I believe you, by the way.

25:43.681 --> 25:45.773
I don't think you killed Mike Pennisi.

25:46.665 --> 25:48.137
Thanks, Mr J.

25:48.323 --> 25:53.029
Look, things will work themselves
out, but you've gotta chill, Franky.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.340
Don't let the others drag you back in.

26:00.424 --> 26:02.065
You should have done a runner years ago.

26:02.071 --> 26:03.652
Yeah, then where would you be?

26:04.845 --> 26:06.660
Thanks, Di, your shift's up.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.902
Righto.

26:11.108 --> 26:13.704
You don't have much of
a poker face, do you?

26:13.710 --> 26:15.715
Doyle's chasing Jesper's murderer.

26:15.811 --> 26:18.036
She's convinced Vera to
pull your phone records.

26:18.042 --> 26:20.999
- How stupid do they think we are?
- We?

26:22.155 --> 26:24.194
We are done.

26:24.987 --> 26:27.189
I'm paying you back your 90 grand.

26:27.369 --> 26:28.756
It wasn't a loan.

26:28.762 --> 26:30.111
You earned it.

26:31.225 --> 26:34.765
Well, then I'm going to use it to
get as far from you as possible.

26:34.922 --> 26:36.857
How naïve you are.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.859
You still don't realise, do you?

26:40.059 --> 26:41.455
What?

26:43.656 --> 26:46.280
It's not me you're running from.

26:57.436 --> 27:00.151
Fuck!

27:01.642 --> 27:03.067
Fuck.

27:10.036 --> 27:13.315
Hey Turk, it's me. Yeah,
I want another delivery.

27:13.321 --> 27:15.057
No, let's go double this time.

27:16.516 --> 27:17.845
Cheers.

27:23.512 --> 27:25.301
- See you tomorrow, Bridget.
- Jake.

27:25.307 --> 27:28.392
Oh, ah, Vera wanted me to ask you, um...

27:28.452 --> 27:30.173
how Franky Doyle's getting on.

27:30.179 --> 27:32.970
Ah, not too good, actually.

27:32.976 --> 27:35.667
She's been spouting some
pretty crazy stuff earlier.

27:35.726 --> 27:37.956
Sounds like I should
have a chat with her.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.945
Yeah, that'd be good.
Maybe in the morning.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.523
I could do it now, if you like.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.432
No, you're on your way home

27:44.438 --> 27:45.992
- and I don't want to...
- Oh, it's all right...

27:46.016 --> 27:47.502
Really, I haven't got anywhere to be.

27:47.508 --> 27:49.196
And I... I really don't want Vera...

27:49.289 --> 27:51.383
- worrying, so.
- Righto.

28:06.031 --> 28:07.591
- Oi!
- Ho-oh!

28:07.719 --> 28:10.944
Oh, shit, Franky! I
was gonna surprise ya.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.359
Oh, well, mission accompanied.
What the fuck are ya doin'?

28:13.365 --> 28:15.538
- There's hot bitches.
- Yeah, I can see.

28:15.544 --> 28:18.572
Yeah, 'cause your cell was
looking so freaking sad, eh?

28:18.578 --> 28:20.413
It was like you didn't
wanna be here or something.

28:20.419 --> 28:22.737
- No shit, Booms.
- 'Cause you're a leso, right?

28:22.743 --> 28:24.275
- So, now you can just, like,

28:24.281 --> 28:25.742
lie back and

28:25.748 --> 28:28.947
tickle the taco while you
look at 'em. Like... Ah-ah...

28:28.953 --> 28:31.935
- Boomer? Booms? I'm not stayin'.
- Ah! Ah!

28:32.150 --> 28:33.963
I don't have anything on my walls

28:33.969 --> 28:35.830
because I don't want
it to feel like a home.

28:35.836 --> 28:38.870
But, like, what about
taking down Ferguson?

28:38.876 --> 28:40.306
'Cause you were like old Franky

28:40.312 --> 28:43.056
- today. I knew you had it in ya.
- I'm not takin' down Ferguson.

28:43.406 --> 28:46.264
But next time, we'll do her
together, okay, 'cause we're a team.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.686
Hey, what'd you do that for?!

28:49.692 --> 28:51.992
I never want this to
feel like a home again!

28:51.998 --> 28:54.046
Now, fuck off and get out of here!

29:02.524 --> 29:03.724
Yeah!

29:04.936 --> 29:06.575
We love him so much.

29:06.581 --> 29:09.360
And here's the little man
with his first football.

29:09.366 --> 29:10.844
- Have a look, Maxie.
- Oh, God, they start

29:10.850 --> 29:12.071
- 'em young in the west.
- I know.

29:12.077 --> 29:14.250
- He's so handsome.
- Isn't he?

29:14.256 --> 29:17.165
- Takes after me, darling.
- Of course, darling, yes.

29:17.171 --> 29:20.460
Love, you really should put
in for that transfer to Perth,

29:20.466 --> 29:22.444
'cause you don't want
to miss out on all this.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.615
Franky's fucked in the head!

29:24.621 --> 29:26.647
Love, I told you to give her some space.

29:26.653 --> 29:28.646
What the fuck's her fucking problem?!

29:28.652 --> 29:30.842
- Booms, she's got a lot on her mind.
- Mmm.

29:30.857 --> 29:34.588
- So do I.
- Oh, I need a good stiff drink.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.937
Liz, be a doll. My shampoo bottle.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.421
It's a single malt.

29:41.001 --> 29:42.409
And not the conditioner.

29:42.415 --> 29:44.220
- That is conditioner.
- All right.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.350
Meeting with your lawyer
didn't go so great?

29:46.356 --> 29:47.634
Oh, it's a joke.

29:47.821 --> 29:49.720
My trial starts any day now

29:49.726 --> 29:52.484
and all of a sudden, out of the
blue, comes a mystery witness,

29:52.490 --> 29:54.315
claiming I confessed to them.

29:54.796 --> 29:57.070
- Who's this witness?
- Oh, anonymous.

29:57.076 --> 29:58.560
Protecting their identity.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.992
Can you believe the cowardice?

30:00.998 --> 30:04.090
Well, there you go, poor thing.

30:04.214 --> 30:06.574
You must have some
idea who it is, though?

30:06.580 --> 30:08.215
I don't even know if
it's a man or a woman.

30:08.221 --> 30:10.592
- Oh.
- Mystery Witness X, huh?

30:10.965 --> 30:12.474
I'm betting it's a woman, though.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.763
Women tend to dislike
me as a general rule,

30:14.769 --> 30:16.241
present company excepted, of course.

30:16.247 --> 30:18.646
They all think I'm running
off with their husbands.

30:19.129 --> 30:20.339
Did you?

30:20.345 --> 30:21.764
One or two.

30:21.770 --> 30:23.441
You bloody slag.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.537
Hang on, can you be
a slag if you're rich?

30:25.543 --> 30:27.565
No, Susan, you're a mistress.

30:27.571 --> 30:29.849
Mm, well, I wouldn't
want to be Witness X

30:29.855 --> 30:31.284
when you find out who they are.

30:31.517 --> 30:33.783
I'll take more than their
husbands from them.

30:34.370 --> 30:35.570
Ha.

30:36.175 --> 30:37.375
Hm.

30:39.478 --> 30:40.859
Come in.

30:49.208 --> 30:50.533
Mmm.

30:53.628 --> 30:56.512
- Oh, fuck, I wanna come home.
- I want you to come home.

30:57.416 --> 30:58.616
Mmmm.

30:58.902 --> 31:00.825
I heard you attacked Ferguson.

31:00.831 --> 31:03.271
Baby, you can't do
that. I'm worried sick.

31:03.277 --> 31:04.824
She's tryin' to fit me up.

31:04.941 --> 31:07.326
She had a gun planted
that she reckons is mine.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.857
- A gun?
- Yeah.

31:10.019 --> 31:12.776
- But it's not.
- No, course not.

31:12.836 --> 31:14.331
So, you're innocent, right?

31:14.337 --> 31:17.049
Yeah, you fuckin' kidding,
right? Ferguson's the psycho.

31:17.055 --> 31:19.360
She's not gonna to stop
until I'm back here!

31:21.436 --> 31:25.512
Just don't let her drag you into
something that you're gonna regret.

31:25.916 --> 31:28.045
Just baby, hold tight, okay?

31:28.051 --> 31:29.795
Just hold tight, for both of us.

31:29.801 --> 31:31.754
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.287
It's the police. They
want to interview Doyle.

31:38.773 --> 31:41.525
Just so we're clear, in our
last interview you told us you

31:41.531 --> 31:43.918
had never seen this weapon before?

31:43.924 --> 31:45.124
Yep.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.611
- Do you want to revise that statement?
- Nuh.

31:49.904 --> 31:51.900
That's a no. Can we move on, please?

31:52.817 --> 31:54.637
The DNA results are in.

31:56.263 --> 31:58.458
We couldn't match you
to anything in the house.

31:58.464 --> 31:59.672
No shit.

31:59.678 --> 32:02.784
But you are a perfect match
to the sample under his nails.

32:02.790 --> 32:03.880
As you'd expect.

32:03.886 --> 32:06.760
As my client told you, Pennisi
scratched her neck in the car.

32:06.766 --> 32:10.384
The DNA also puts this gun in your hand.

32:17.181 --> 32:18.513
What are you talking about?

32:18.519 --> 32:21.575
See all these little grooves? They
get skin and sweat from your hand.

32:21.581 --> 32:23.470
They're almost impossible to wipe clean.

32:23.476 --> 32:26.693
Apparently you sweated all
over the grip, Francesca.

32:26.699 --> 32:28.733
Don't say a thing, Ms Doyle. Not a word.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.796
And I'd like to speak
to my client, alone. Now!

32:33.774 --> 32:35.214
Be my guest.

32:37.870 --> 32:39.198
Thank you.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.480
Right.

32:49.396 --> 32:51.170
99% match.

32:52.193 --> 32:55.038
It's not the end of the
world, but it's pretty bad.

32:55.044 --> 32:56.851
I handled the gun but I didn't kill him.

32:56.857 --> 32:58.820
Yeah, but now you've lied
to the police about it,

32:58.826 --> 33:01.161
- which is never good.
- It's all a fuckin' setup.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.605
That's not a very compelling
defence, I'm afraid.

33:03.611 --> 33:06.349
- What, so you don't believe me?
- Look, what I believe is irrelevant.

33:06.355 --> 33:08.259
I'm here to defend
you, not to judge you.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.058
You're not gonna wanna hear this.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.482
I think you should
consider changing your plea.

33:13.488 --> 33:15.000
- Forget it.
- Your best chance

33:15.006 --> 33:17.067
right now is to plead
guilty to manslaughter

33:17.073 --> 33:19.746
and that's if I can persuade
them to accept a lesser charge.

33:19.752 --> 33:21.560
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do that.

33:21.912 --> 33:25.138
You're smart, okay? You work in
the law. You've seen how this goes.

33:25.144 --> 33:27.820
What, so you want me to cop
to something I didn't even do?

33:27.826 --> 33:29.943
That's your expert advice, is it?

33:30.150 --> 33:32.319
Your partner is paying
me a substantial amount

33:32.325 --> 33:34.453
- for my expert advice.
- Yeah, not anymore she isn't.

33:34.459 --> 33:36.066
- I'm dismissin' ya.
- Sorry?

33:36.072 --> 33:38.966
Fuck off! I didn't do it!

33:38.972 --> 33:41.120
And I need someone who believes me.

33:41.793 --> 33:42.993
Okay.

33:44.729 --> 33:46.104
That's your prerogative.

33:46.110 --> 33:47.333
Yeah.

33:49.510 --> 33:53.015
You know if you're found guilty,
you'll be in here for life.

33:59.455 --> 34:00.963
Oh, God. *

34:12.945 --> 34:14.219
Fuck you!

34:14.545 --> 34:17.313
Get me out, you fuckin' idiot!

34:17.717 --> 34:20.954
God! Fuck off!

34:21.409 --> 34:22.650
Fuck!

34:22.657 --> 34:24.312
Fuck!

34:28.601 --> 34:32.719
Arrrrrrgh!

34:36.031 --> 34:38.536
Hey, how'd it go?

34:38.632 --> 34:41.562
I am going to be Governor for
a while longer, it would seem.

34:41.568 --> 34:43.103
- That's fantastic news.
- Yeah,

34:43.110 --> 34:45.047
the board accepted my report on Murphy

34:45.053 --> 34:47.399
and my recommendations.
I think I was quite good.

34:47.405 --> 34:48.899
Well, of course you were.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.500
So, that puts an end to
Ferguson's conspiracy claim.

34:52.505 --> 34:56.161
There's no evidence that Smith
bribed an officer to let her out,

34:56.167 --> 34:57.887
or that she intended to kill Ferguson.

34:57.893 --> 34:59.182
She's not going to be happy.

34:59.188 --> 35:00.789
No, I don't suppose she will be.

35:01.848 --> 35:04.644
Was there any more trouble
between her and Doyle?

35:04.738 --> 35:08.629
No, but I sent Doyle in for
a psych appointment anyhow.

35:09.537 --> 35:10.737
Really?

35:11.144 --> 35:13.238
Yeah, Bridget said you
were worried about her.

35:13.531 --> 35:15.219
She even stayed back late to see Doyle.

35:15.225 --> 35:17.752
- Did she?
- That's okay, isn't it?

35:17.818 --> 35:19.834
- I made the right call?
- Yeah, no, of course. It's fine.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.070
- You wanted me to step up and
- Yeah...

35:21.076 --> 35:23.428
- take responsibility.
- Yes, well done.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.459
No, Bridget knows what she's doing.

35:25.633 --> 35:27.623
Right. Well, ah...

35:28.008 --> 35:29.719
we should celebrate your good news then.

35:29.725 --> 35:32.720
- Yep. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Tonight?

35:33.904 --> 35:36.092
Yeah. Mm. Okay.

35:36.623 --> 35:38.100
- Tonight.
- All right.

35:43.563 --> 35:45.877
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

35:45.883 --> 35:47.973
Count will commence in ten minutes.

36:04.597 --> 36:07.229
- Hey, Frank.
- Just get out!

36:12.688 --> 36:14.312
I trashed my cell once.

36:14.579 --> 36:16.425
I was off my face.

36:16.431 --> 36:18.217
Smashed everything in sight.

36:18.223 --> 36:20.509
Grabbed all my clothes, ripped 'em up.

36:21.087 --> 36:25.278
I was about to chuck this snow
dome at the wall when I realised,

36:26.093 --> 36:27.684
I don't own a snow dome.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.161
Yep. Wrong cell.

36:33.935 --> 36:36.020
Yeah, well, this is definitely my cell,

36:36.317 --> 36:38.729
- and it will be forever now.
- You don't know that.

36:38.735 --> 36:41.180
Last time there was
some hope of getting out.

36:41.466 --> 36:44.795
If I get convicted this
time, it's gonna be 25 years.

36:54.433 --> 36:56.409
Do you still think it was Ferguson?

36:56.415 --> 36:57.840
Yeah, it has to be.

36:58.050 --> 37:01.629
- Then let's fix her up. Permanently.
- Nah.

37:02.908 --> 37:05.076
- No, I can't.
- Sure we can.

37:05.082 --> 37:07.509
Nuh, I need her alive.

37:08.025 --> 37:10.939
She's the only fucker
who knows who set me up.

37:49.779 --> 37:51.059
Chinkerbell.

37:51.157 --> 37:52.375
Bush Pig.

37:53.415 --> 37:55.282
Pleasure doing business.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.563
Hooroo.

37:58.686 --> 38:01.904
Attention, all staff. Manned
van will arrive in ten minutes.

38:01.910 --> 38:04.215
- A tramp stamp?
- More like a welcome mat.

38:04.221 --> 38:05.796
Like, there?

38:05.934 --> 38:07.216
Just lower than that. *

38:07.222 --> 38:09.246
- Ow! That fucking hurt!
- Well, don't stick it out.

38:09.252 --> 38:10.840
You don't wanna ***.

38:10.846 --> 38:12.238
I will show you. I'll
show you good ones,

38:12.244 --> 38:13.513
- eh.
- Just the good ones.

38:13.519 --> 38:14.780
No.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.102
Maxie, no.

38:17.376 --> 38:20.812
Not yet. No, y-y-you... oh.
You never said it was today.

38:20.818 --> 38:22.701
I just found out myself, hon.

38:22.795 --> 38:24.420
My ride's here now.

38:24.426 --> 38:26.242
Good luck with everything, darlin'.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.233
I'm gonna miss you all.

38:29.239 --> 38:30.939
We're gonna miss you too, love.

38:30.945 --> 38:32.497
You girls make sure

38:32.503 --> 38:34.446
- you take care of Booms for me.
- Oh, yeah.

38:34.452 --> 38:36.289
Don't you forget about me, will you?

38:36.295 --> 38:39.320
- Don't you forget about me, Maxie.
- That's never gonna happen.

38:39.514 --> 38:41.850
Come here, girl. God.

38:44.327 --> 38:45.744
I love you, darling.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.974
Oh. Mmm.

38:48.779 --> 38:50.479
- Take care, Maxie.
- Yes.

38:50.765 --> 38:52.453
Good luck, girl, huh?

38:53.855 --> 38:56.249
She loved you so much.

38:56.687 --> 38:58.217
Time to go, Conway.

39:04.893 --> 39:07.169
- I love you, Booms.
- I love you.

39:07.175 --> 39:08.733
I love you so much.

39:08.739 --> 39:09.939
Bye-bye.

39:10.343 --> 39:12.803
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

39:12.952 --> 39:15.409
- Bye-bye, Maxie.
- Bye, Maxie. We love ya.

39:15.415 --> 39:17.944
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:18.015 --> 39:19.508
Bye, Max.

39:25.755 --> 39:28.227
- We love ya.
- I love you.

39:37.930 --> 39:42.320
And Sonia said that she
felt guilty about that.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.926
Oh, Jesus, Dor.

39:44.932 --> 39:47.182
You trying to give me a heart attack?

39:47.967 --> 39:50.503
- Oh, that was hard, hey?
- Mmm.

39:50.509 --> 39:54.501
- Poor Boomer, she's gutted.
- Oh, I'm not surprised, love.

39:54.712 --> 39:56.423
We're gonna have to keep our eye on her.

39:56.429 --> 39:57.629
Mmm.

39:58.686 --> 40:00.014
What's that?

40:00.209 --> 40:02.891
You got a secret love
letter? Oh, ya tart!

40:02.897 --> 40:05.825
No, no it's just a...
a letter from Soph.

40:06.815 --> 40:08.968
They got computers at Barnhurst?

40:09.178 --> 40:12.188
- What?
- It's printed on a computer.

40:16.295 --> 40:17.615
Shut the door.

40:17.989 --> 40:20.209
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

40:20.215 --> 40:22.577
Phones are now available for use.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.208
Oh, shit!

40:35.575 --> 40:37.695
Liz, you're not Witness X?

40:38.919 --> 40:42.216
Oh, my God. What were you thinking?

40:42.332 --> 40:44.043
Sonia did it.

40:44.637 --> 40:47.596
I know she did it, and
she's gonna get away with it.

40:47.602 --> 40:49.546
That's not your problem.

40:49.552 --> 40:52.369
But it will be when the women
find out that you're lagging again.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.914
No, they're never gonna find out.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.610
And what happens when you're
stuck in here with Sonia, hey?

40:56.696 --> 40:58.501
God knows what she'll do to ya.

40:58.507 --> 40:59.872
I did a deal.

41:00.977 --> 41:03.985
They're lettin' me out as
soon as I give my statement.

41:03.991 --> 41:07.913
- You're leaving, too?
- Well, yeah. Love, I am.

41:08.202 --> 41:12.405
Oh, God, and so should you, to
Perth, love. Your future is not here.

41:12.411 --> 41:15.796
It's with Nash and Joshie, isn't it? Oh.

41:16.778 --> 41:21.389
Ooh, this is all very secretive.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.357
What juicy gossip am I missing?

41:23.363 --> 41:24.966
- Nah, nothin'.
- Oh, nothing.

41:24.972 --> 41:26.556
Liz just reckons I should transfer

41:26.562 --> 41:28.009
- to West Australia. Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:28.015 --> 41:29.845
Oh, no, too many sharks.

41:40.413 --> 41:44.359
Hey. Guess I'm on your shit list, eh?

41:46.353 --> 41:49.479
- Really sorry about before.
- You told me to fuck off.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.612
You fuck off.

41:52.868 --> 41:55.294
It's not that I don't
want to hang out with ya.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.288
I love you guys.

41:57.479 --> 41:59.028
You're my family.

42:06.909 --> 42:10.140
I just don't wanna be
here anymore, full stop.

42:10.146 --> 42:12.214
I don't want this to be my life.

42:12.706 --> 42:15.398
I just want the family back together.

42:16.290 --> 42:20.136
I just want everything
back the way that it was.

42:21.757 --> 42:23.439
We still mates?

42:35.489 --> 42:38.069
Oh, give us a hug, ya douchebag.

42:38.075 --> 42:41.593
- Oh, ya big sook!
- No... just...

42:41.599 --> 42:44.741
- stop it! Oh, no.
- You've gone soft on me.

42:44.747 --> 42:47.374
- I haven't.
- Just dance with me.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.475
Just... dance with me... Booms.

42:51.647 --> 42:54.549
- I fuckin' missed you.
- I fuckin' missed you.

42:54.911 --> 42:56.521
Ugh!

42:59.527 --> 43:00.731
Come in.

43:05.153 --> 43:08.965
I'm sorry, I... I had to
see her. I-I... I love her.

43:08.971 --> 43:11.121
- What happened to being discreet?
- It-it-it looked like

43:11.127 --> 43:13.447
- a normal appointment.
- What, after hours?

43:13.931 --> 43:17.129
If people put two and two together,
it will cost you your career.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.143
Especially now Franky's DNA's

43:19.149 --> 43:20.674
been found under Pennisi's fingernails

43:20.680 --> 43:22.384
- and on the gun.
- What?!

43:23.189 --> 43:24.389
Oh!

43:24.937 --> 43:26.148
Oh, Franky.

43:26.154 --> 43:29.103
- Oh, Bridget, I am trying to help you.
- Okay.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.940
I think it best you stay
away from Franky altogether.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.228
Franky!

43:36.655 --> 43:38.484
Frank... Franky.

43:40.975 --> 43:42.805
Told me it wasn't your gun.

43:42.999 --> 43:45.687
Yeah, it isn't. It's Ferguson's.

43:45.976 --> 43:48.097
Then why is your DNA all over it?

43:48.687 --> 43:52.172
It's messy. But I took it from her
godson before he could kill Jesper

43:52.178 --> 43:54.567
and I dumped it, and
somehow it's turned up again.

43:54.758 --> 43:57.465
Do you know how unbelievable
it all sounds, right?

43:57.879 --> 44:00.466
- How crazy?
- Yeah I know, but it's true.

44:00.472 --> 44:01.880
Franky, you lied to me.

44:01.886 --> 44:03.474
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you've

44:03.480 --> 44:05.293
hidden things from me
and that's the same thing.

44:05.299 --> 44:07.955
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause I was tryin' to protect ya.

44:07.961 --> 44:09.533
I didn't want you to lose your job.

44:09.916 --> 44:11.833
Well, it's not how it looks to everyone.

44:12.213 --> 44:14.930
Everyone? Really?

44:15.505 --> 44:17.691
So is that what you think, huh?

44:17.753 --> 44:19.157
Or is this Pearce speakin',

44:19.163 --> 44:20.964
'cause he doesn't believe
me. That's why I sacked him.

44:20.970 --> 44:23.046
- Like it was...
- He was trying to help you, Frank.

44:23.052 --> 44:24.966
We're all trying to help you.

44:25.238 --> 44:28.742
Oh, so I'm a liar and a murderer.
Is that it? Is that what you think?

44:28.748 --> 44:32.668
I have risked everything for
you. Why couldn't you trust me?

44:38.780 --> 44:40.306
Oh, no!

44:41.646 --> 44:42.846
Oh.

44:43.256 --> 44:46.384
Oh, shit! Forgot my shampoo.

44:46.746 --> 44:48.894
All right, can I borrow your shampoo?

44:48.900 --> 44:50.100
Nuh!

44:50.855 --> 44:52.082
Why not?

44:53.183 --> 44:55.269
I haven't got much left, love.

45:29.972 --> 45:31.366
Hello, Vera.

45:31.967 --> 45:33.713
It's not my birthday.

45:37.404 --> 45:39.962
If you think I'm going to give
you the satisfaction of asking

45:39.968 --> 45:42.967
what's in the box,
you are sadly mistaken.

45:45.068 --> 45:46.688
No, give in. What's in the box?

45:46.694 --> 45:48.117
I've just come from a board meeting,

45:48.123 --> 45:50.096
one I think you would have
found very interesting.

45:50.102 --> 45:52.888
- I doubt that.
- An officer resigned.

45:53.044 --> 45:55.023
Officer Murphy. You remember her.

45:55.105 --> 45:56.825
Always skiving off for a smoke.

45:56.831 --> 45:59.326
Exactly. She confessed

45:59.332 --> 46:01.638
to losing her swipe card

46:01.644 --> 46:04.056
on the day you murdered Bea Smith.

46:04.062 --> 46:06.855
Smith used it to escape
into no man's land.

46:06.941 --> 46:08.627
That proves nothing.

46:08.633 --> 46:12.261
It does quash your
supposed conspiracy theory

46:12.331 --> 46:14.246
and undermines your self-defence claim.

46:14.252 --> 46:16.529
Smith didn't collude with an officer.

46:16.535 --> 46:19.325
She didn't bribe anyone
to let her out to kill you.

46:19.331 --> 46:21.557
When Mr Jackson and I found you,

46:21.563 --> 46:23.139
Smith was dead

46:23.236 --> 46:25.150
and you were holding a shiv.

46:27.925 --> 46:32.019
Getting out of here might take
a bit longer than you thought.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.214
S'pose you think you're very clever.

46:39.308 --> 46:41.103
I think the size is right.

46:42.595 --> 46:44.612
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

46:44.618 --> 46:46.314
Count will commence in ten minutes.

47:08.628 --> 47:10.741
She thinks she's outsmarted you.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.639
Pfft. Pathetic little underling.

47:28.010 --> 47:30.205
She's taken everything you value.

47:31.112 --> 47:33.495
Your job. Your reputation.

47:35.735 --> 47:37.205
Your freedom.

47:37.415 --> 47:39.426
You just gonna stand there and take it?

47:43.575 --> 47:45.396
Dismantle her.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.228
Piece by piece.

47:50.785 --> 47:54.646
Professionally. Psychologically.

47:55.860 --> 47:57.666
Emotionally.

47:58.755 --> 48:00.950
She will be punished, Bea.

48:01.667 --> 48:03.958
En garde, Vera.

48:04.853 --> 48:08.541
From the ashes, I am rising.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.445
Tuesday, at 08:30 PM.

48:37.271 --> 48:38.530
You can get changed here.

48:38.536 --> 48:40.022
You'll leave the prison
through a back exit.

48:40.028 --> 48:42.295
You'll be released
on parole immediately.

48:42.301 --> 48:44.182
It's the first day of your new life.

48:44.787 --> 48:47.116
Sonia never confessed, did she?

48:47.122 --> 48:48.491
Why would you lie?

48:48.497 --> 48:51.077
Because the woman she
murdered and her kids

48:51.083 --> 48:52.705
deserve justice.

48:53.179 --> 48:56.455
If anyone finds out
about this you're dead.

48:57.375 --> 49:02.114
Wentworth. Tuesday,
08:30 PM on Show Case.
