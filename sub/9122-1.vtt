00:45.879 --> 00:50.383
Try as they will and
try as they might,

00:50.384 --> 00:54.554
who steals me gold won't
live through the night.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.791
A limousine?

02:05.792 --> 02:09.377
What in the world has
gotten into you, Mr. O'Grady?

02:09.378 --> 02:13.424
Just the start, my dear.
Just the start.

02:13.425 --> 02:17.595
Take the last look at this dump.

02:17.596 --> 02:21.891
Tomorrow we'll be
looking at mansions.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.061
Mansions? Will you
listen to yourself?

02:25.062 --> 02:29.899
And a limousine?
We've got no money for this.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.119
Right inside.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.616
Did the funeral parlor
deliver the package?

02:38.617 --> 02:41.577
Aye. 'Tis on the porch
where they left it.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.913
I don't want to touch it.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.667
Will you tell me what's going
on here, Daniel O'Grady?

02:49.668 --> 02:51.504
Will that be all, sir?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.758
Joseph.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.553
Bon voyage, captain.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.014
Thank you very much, sir.
You have a nice evening.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.142
Ma'am.

03:05.268 --> 03:09.068
What's going on here is we're rich.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.983
You were supposed
to bury your mother,

03:12.984 --> 03:16.363
not send her ashes all
the way from Ireland.

03:22.119 --> 03:26.874
- What are you going to do?
- It's not me mother's ashes.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.045
Gold, Leah! Gold!

03:33.046 --> 03:36.173
What in the Lord's name?

03:36.174 --> 03:39.677
A pot of gold.
A wee person, a leprechaun.

03:39.678 --> 03:44.056
I caught him and made him
show me where his gold is.

03:45.057 --> 03:46.809
It's the rule, you know.

03:46.810 --> 03:50.396
Aye, you're a drunken fool,
and a storyteller.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.608
- It's the truth, I'm telling...
- There's a storm brewing.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.736
I'm telling you the truth.

03:56.737 --> 04:02.074
Come on to bed, now, and I'll
make you a pot of nice hot tea.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.326
Leprechaun indeed.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.913
Pot of gold. Whatever next?

04:27.392 --> 04:30.561
Dan? Dan, is that you?

04:30.562 --> 04:35.608
Mary had a little lamb

04:35.609 --> 04:40.571
Little lamb, little lamb

04:40.572 --> 04:44.950
Mary had a little lamb

04:44.951 --> 04:49.246
Whose fleece was white as snow

04:49.247 --> 04:53.209
He followed her to school one day

04:53.210 --> 04:56.629
School one day school one day

04:56.630 --> 04:59.673
He followed her to school one day

04:59.674 --> 05:03.469
Which was against the rules

05:03.470 --> 05:07.097
I can't breathe.
Please open the suitcase.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.817
I'm going to suffocate.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.571
Do you like the gold
buckles on me shoes?

05:22.572 --> 05:25.825
I want me gold now!

05:25.826 --> 05:29.330
Oh, God, no!

05:48.431 --> 05:51.016
Oh.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.485
No problem.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.358
I smell some tea brewing.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.534
I hid the gold, Leah. We're rich now.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.996
Where did you hide it, Dan?

06:17.836 --> 06:20.714
Did you hide it somewhere
near the house?

06:21.798 --> 06:24.216
Tell me where you hid the gold.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
How did you find me?

06:25.886 --> 06:29.847
The wee people have
their magical ways.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.601
I knew it. What have
you done with my wife?

06:33.602 --> 06:36.937
Oh. Oh, the poor lass.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.658
I should've told her
to watch her step.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.946
I got ya! It's my gold!

06:46.031 --> 06:49.375
I'll fix him. I'll get him.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.330
Your wife makes a fine pot
of tea, Danny me boy.

06:55.731 --> 06:57.082
Where did you get that?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.585
- I'll fix you, you bastard!
- No! No!

06:59.586 --> 07:02.338
Here's what you'll get, you monster.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.548
Get it away! Put it away!

07:04.549 --> 07:07.217
I got the gold fair and square.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.470
Them were the rules.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.558
Catch me if you can!

07:14.559 --> 07:17.278
You can't get away.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.155
Looking for something?

07:28.156 --> 07:30.704
What did you do?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.371
You... You killed my wife.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.082
Hello, Dan. I'm okay.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.834
I just got a little kink in me neck.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.088
I should have killed you when
I caught you in Ireland.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.090
Give him the gold, Dan.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.634
He's a nice little leprechaun.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.428
I'll give you more than gold!

07:54.140 --> 07:56.225
Your bullets won't stop me forever.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.945
I'll keep coming back.

08:27.841 --> 08:32.135
The power of this clover will
keep you in there forever.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.888
Get that damn clover off this crate!

08:34.889 --> 08:37.474
I told you you couldn't kill me.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.649
Where's me gold, Danny me boy?

08:48.820 --> 08:52.290
Oh, Danny, don't strain yourself now.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.836
No, not gasoline.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.797
You can't burn me. I won't let ya.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.343
Don't strain yourself.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.804
You're not as young
as you used to be.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.015
You might have a stroke.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.226
I curse ye for all eternity.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.772
I traded me soul for me gold.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.559
You'll trade your life.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.361
If you give me me gold back...

09:31.362 --> 09:33.864
I'll go away.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.951
- Oh!
- Danny! What's wrong?

09:48.630 --> 09:53.101
Burn in hell,
you little green bastard!

09:56.513 --> 09:59.681
Did the match go out, Danny?

10:29.587 --> 10:35.801
<i>I say I need a four-leaf clover</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:41.598
<i>One that's strong
and won't blow away</i>

10:41.599 --> 10:47.479
<i>Won't you be my four-leaf clover</i>

10:47.480 --> 10:52.611
<i>Be my lucky charm
that's here to stay</i>

10:57.448 --> 11:00.409
Dad, I'm still depressed.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.661
I mean, come on.
Here I am in New Mexico

11:02.662 --> 11:05.164
with my hick father
for the whole summer.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.333
- Hey.
- No offense.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.254
First of all, it's not New
Mexico, it's North Dakota.

11:12.255 --> 11:16.430
Like it matters. All I care
about is it's not L.A.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.035
Wait.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.953
This is a joke, right?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.705
This is our poor neighbor's house,

11:46.706 --> 11:49.504
and then you're gonna
take us to our house.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.885
Never judge a book
by its cover, honey.

11:56.883 --> 12:01.013
Dad, this book doesn't
even have a cover.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.775
I'm going to be miserable here.
There's no swimming pool.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.694
There's no shopping malls.
There's no cable.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.821
Bet you don't even have a TV.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.541
Oh, this sure ain't Beverly Hills.

12:28.164 --> 12:33.591
I can't wait to see this house.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.908
Careful.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.036
Oh, great.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.998
Just when I thought this house
couldn't get any worse,

13:10.999 --> 13:13.458
an old basement.

13:14.159 --> 13:18.588
Well, great place to store all the
rocks and pinecones I'm gonna find.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.883
Okay, okay. It's a little dusty.
I admit that.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.470
Just clean it up a little bit,
splash some paint around.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.348
Oh, God. You'll need to slap
some bulldozers around

13:28.349 --> 13:30.475
to fix this place up.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.936
Oh, God! Gross. Cobwebs.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.273
You're making too big a
deal out of this, honey.

13:36.274 --> 13:40.402
This is a great house.
I got a great buy on it.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.905
Yeah, from who, Dracula?

13:44.115 --> 13:47.784
How about I get a hotel
somewhere in town,

13:47.785 --> 13:51.079
and you can come visit,
like, once a week?

13:51.080 --> 13:55.500
- Hey, I'll pay for it.
- Tory, honey,

13:55.501 --> 14:00.380
you really think money's all you
need to get by in this life?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.591
Okay. I'll go with that theory.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.347
Oh...

14:09.348 --> 14:12.309
Dad! Do you see that spider?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.437
It's huge. That thing could kill us.

14:15.438 --> 14:18.523
Okay, I'm going to turn around and
I'm walking out of this basement,

14:18.524 --> 14:20.192
and I'm going back up to the jeep.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.028
I'm making a reservation at
the nearest hotel in town.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.905
This is worse than summer camp!

14:24.906 --> 14:27.199
I'd rather sleep in a tent!

14:31.120 --> 14:33.580
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Hello? We're breaking up.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.375
Wait. Okay. Okay. That's good.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.627
Okay, hi. I'd like to
make a reservation.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.630
Yes. I'd like it to be a really tall
room, and I want it to be very...

14:41.631 --> 14:44.007
- Oh!
- Great!

14:44.008 --> 14:46.134
Who are you?

14:46.135 --> 14:49.388
I was a guy carrying
some paint thinner.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.390
Oh, G... Okay.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.350
Here. Does that cover?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.227
Wait. Hold on a second.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.312
You knock over my can
of paint thinner,

14:57.313 --> 15:00.273
and then you offer me 20 bucks?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.859
Okay. Okay.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.570
How about that? Will that do it?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.239
No.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.994
But maybe if you said you were
sorry, you know, it might.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.663
Okay. Here. Look, keep the change.
I'm in a really big hurry.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.582
There's a big, ugly, disgusting house
I'd just like to distance myself from.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.543
What, you mean this house here?
The O'Grady place?

15:19.544 --> 15:22.462
Yeah, that place. It's really gross.
There's bugs. There's cobwebs.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.881
God only knows what else is in there.

15:27.682 --> 15:28.844
What's so funny?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.846
Well, I just think it's
funny the way girls

15:30.847 --> 15:32.931
are always afraid of spiders
and stuff, you know?

15:32.932 --> 15:36.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait a minute.

15:36.310 --> 15:40.355
Did I misplace my 1950s
calendar here? Girls?

15:40.356 --> 15:43.275
Listen, Bud. Okay, this is the '90s.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.069
Women are treated equal.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.072
Well, first off, my name
isn't Bud, it's Nathan.

15:49.073 --> 15:53.076
And I don't know many guys
that are afraid of houses.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.537
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.039
Well, you know what? Neither am I.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.708
I'm not afraid of anything.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.084
- Okay.
- Right.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.545
- Tory? Honey?
- Yeah?

16:03.546 --> 16:04.921
- What?
- Let's go.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.590
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

16:06.591 --> 16:09.885
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.
The house. You hate the house.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.137
- No...
- It's dirty, it's dusty.

16:12.138 --> 16:16.099
You really think I'm afraid of
a little dust and some bugs?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.768
Come on. Just put
the bags back, okay?

16:18.769 --> 16:21.988
I want to stay.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.941
Dad, would you put the bags back?

16:24.942 --> 16:28.036
I'm gonna stay.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.707
Anyway, listen, listen.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.293
It came right down out of the sky.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.171
There it was,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.507
this flying saucer.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.551
Had these really weird
lights, you know?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.803
And making all these weird noises.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.389
Kind of like... Kind of like,
"boop boop boop boop..."

16:56.390 --> 16:59.985
Ozzie, I thought you weren't
gonna tell any more stories.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.146
This really happened, Alex. It did.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.858
It's like magic, you know? Like...

17:06.858 --> 17:09.778
Like, um...

17:09.779 --> 17:13.240
Well, when you see
a star in the night sky...

17:13.241 --> 17:15.784
the first star...
you can make a wish.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.621
- It'll come true.
- Stop with the magic stuff.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.875
And no more lies, okay?

17:25.336 --> 17:27.837
How ya doin', boys? I'm J.D.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.798
I just met your brother Nathan.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.218
Hi, I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.
This is my friend Ozzie.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.678
- How you doin', Ozzie?
- Hi.

17:34.679 --> 17:38.515
So, you boys need any help out here?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.725
I'm afraid that our
liability insurance forbids

17:40.726 --> 17:43.478
anyone but us handling
the tools and equipment.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.027
But thanks for the offer.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.656
Boy, I could go for a beer right now.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.408
You're too little to drink.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.661
Don't you ever,
ever drink that stuff!

17:59.662 --> 18:01.454
- Hey, Ozzie, what's this?
- Hey!

18:01.455 --> 18:04.128
Gotcha! Whoa! Let go!

18:25.938 --> 18:28.065
Nathan?

18:51.756 --> 18:54.049
Oh, geez, I'm sorry. You all right?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.635
I was on that shelf, looking for tarps.
I didn't know you were down here.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.346
I was just trying to
make a peace offering,

18:59.347 --> 19:02.307
but I think it's all in that crate.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.309
Hope I didn't ruin what's inside.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.228
Oh, you couldn't
damage what's in here.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.190
- The O'Gradys collected a lot of junk.
- The O'Gradys?

19:10.191 --> 19:14.110
Yeah, Dan O'Grady.
He used to own this place.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.656
He was really a weird,
strange guy, you know?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.367
Oh. You mean, weird and strange

19:20.368 --> 19:25.339
like guys who drive dented pick-up
trucks and paint houses for a living?

19:25.831 --> 19:28.124
Hey, let's see what
he's got in this thing.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.502
Yeah.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.296
Well, that is, of course,
unless you're scared.

19:34.597 --> 19:36.549
Scared? Me?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.969
Give me a crowbar.
I'll bust it open myself.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.222
Got a hammer.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.225
Fine. Hammer is good. Hammer.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.663
That sounds like Ozzie.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.108
Oh, no!

19:53.109 --> 19:57.779
As fashion statements go,
blue is not your best color.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.366
Alex, I asked you to
hold that ladder steady.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.910
Now look what happened!

20:03.911 --> 20:06.955
I'm not even gonna ask
what happened, really.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.374
There's a bathroom off
the kitchen in there.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.048
At least, it looked a
little like a bathroom.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.689
I don't even like blue.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.323
Twinkle, twinkle

20:40.823 --> 20:43.658
Little star

20:43.659 --> 20:46.411
- How I wonder
- Hello?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.290
What you are

20:54.920 --> 20:57.964
Up above the world so high

20:57.965 --> 21:01.468
- Who's in there?
- Like a diamond in the sky

21:01.469 --> 21:05.346
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

21:05.347 --> 21:09.727
How I wonder what you are

21:25.034 --> 21:27.002
Hello?

21:30.372 --> 21:32.294
Hello?

21:35.920 --> 21:40.175
Wow. What neat junk.

21:41.175 --> 21:44.803
Please let me out. Please.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.014
Why won't you let me
out of this crate?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.141
How did you get in there?

21:50.142 --> 21:53.144
Please, let me out.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.605
Please, I don't like it in here.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.733
Please.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.823
Hello?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.408
Hello?

22:10.745 --> 22:12.923
I'm back.

22:16.836 --> 22:21.716
Hey, tubby, you got a light
for an old leprechaun's pipe?

22:29.890 --> 22:33.184
I'm starved.
Haven't eaten in ten years.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.529
What... What are you?

22:37.314 --> 22:39.858
What do I look like, me lad?

22:39.859 --> 22:43.486
See the hat? The buckles on me shoes?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.705
Why, I'm a leprechaun.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.992
A shoemaker by trade.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.245
And speaking of shoes,

22:52.872 --> 22:54.747
yours could use a shine.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.875
But first...

22:58.043 --> 23:02.013
have you seen a crock
of gold lying around?

23:02.506 --> 23:06.342
Tell me, or I'll bite your ear off,

23:06.343 --> 23:09.012
and I'll make a boot out of it.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.445
You only got away 'cause
me powers are weak.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.914
I need me gold!

23:28.407 --> 23:30.283
There's a leprechaun in the basement!

23:30.284 --> 23:31.993
Oh, there's a leprechaun
in the basement!

23:31.994 --> 23:35.038
- Hold on. Slow down.
- He come right up out of a box.

23:35.039 --> 23:38.666
He had these long really
scary fingers, and...

23:38.667 --> 23:42.170
He wasn't nice like Lucky Charms or
anything, and then he ate a bug!

23:42.171 --> 23:43.421
A leprechaun?

23:43.422 --> 23:46.341
Can we inject a little bit
of reality in here, please?

23:46.342 --> 23:48.593
I saw him! I really did see him!

23:48.594 --> 23:50.720
He even tried to polish my shoes!

23:50.721 --> 23:53.264
- So, then, where's your pot of gold?
- That's what he said he wanted.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.517
- He said he wanted his pot of gold.
- All right.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.478
Where you going?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.855
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Ozzie,

24:00.856 --> 24:02.732
we'll all go down in the
basement and check it out.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.401
Don't go in there, don't go
in there, don't go in there!

24:05.402 --> 24:09.822
Hey. Okay? Just in case.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.075
I better go with you.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.285
Just in case.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.120
Nathan? Nathan?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.873
I don't think that stick's
gonna be big enough.

24:18.874 --> 24:23.299
Well, wait. Wait for me.
I'm coming, just in case.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.722
Geez, Ozzie, you really
busted up this crate.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.017
No, no, no. No, I...
I did... I didn't do that.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.437
That... that was the leprechaun.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.940
Leprechaun.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.445
Well, I don't see anything, Ozzie.

24:49.446 --> 24:55.076
But... this guy was real.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.578
I mean, he had buckles on his shoes,

24:57.579 --> 25:00.748
and he had them real horrible teeth,

25:00.749 --> 25:03.584
and they were all rotten and
everything, and... and...

25:03.585 --> 25:07.089
Oh, I... I know he
never does brush 'em.

25:09.858 --> 25:11.384
Th-That's him.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.354
He's gonna kill every one
of us, and I'm first.

25:29.361 --> 25:33.156
- Ozzie, come here.
- I ain't goin' in that dark corner.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.455
Neither am I.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.537
What was that?

25:39.538 --> 25:42.040
Hey, hang on. Hang on.

25:57.576 --> 25:59.054
It's only a rat.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.727
It's just a rat.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.021
Well, Ozzie, I think we
found your leprechaun.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.398
No, no, no.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.277
Y-You don't understand. He...
He was bigger than that.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.529
All right, all right. I think
we've solved this mystery now.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.283
Can we just get out of here?

26:31.256 --> 26:34.258
- Hey! Hey, look up in the sky!
- So what, Ozzie?

26:34.259 --> 26:38.013
- It's just a rainbow.
- It's a magic rainbow.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.766
Leprechauns and rainbows.
It's a sign.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.852
Yeah. Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
It's time to get back to painting.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.938
- Come on.
- No, no, no. No.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.940
We gotta go... go see
what's at the end.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.234
Ozzie, you're embarrassing me.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.903
Come on. Go with me.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.822
We... We gotta get to
the end of the rainbow.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.199
- There's always a pot of gold!
- Ozzie.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.159
He's so easily sidetracked.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.578
Like always, I'll take care of it
and get him back on the job.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.998
Ozzie, come on! Alex!

27:05.999 --> 27:08.084
Oh, come on. Let 'em
go chase rainbows.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.836
Let's you and I go paint.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.806
Um, this is biodegradable, right?

27:13.298 --> 27:17.803
Ozzie, this is stupid! You can't
find the end of the rainbow!

27:22.850 --> 27:25.518
It's where the rainbow ends.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.436
It does sort of look
like where it ends.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.565
Hey, look. It's going away.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.156
Don't cut yourself on any
of this rusty old metal.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.287
If you do, it'll make
your jaw lock shut.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.746
This is neat. Hey,
Ozzie, I got an idea.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.623
- What?
- Let's hotwire this.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.798
I don't think the battery
would be any good.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.965
Ooh.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.259
Look at that.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.386
- Ooh!
- Give me it!

28:00.387 --> 28:01.762
- No, no, no.
- Give me it!

28:01.763 --> 28:04.182
- Just let me look at it for a minute!
- Give me it!

28:04.183 --> 28:07.482
I'll give it right back to you,
I promise. I promise.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.649
- Give me that.
- Hey!

28:16.361 --> 28:18.112
Wow! Look at that!

28:18.113 --> 28:19.906
All right, here's your coin.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.751
I found a bag full of 'em!

28:23.285 --> 28:24.994
- Wow!
- Cool!

28:24.995 --> 28:27.764
I told you. I told you!

28:28.165 --> 28:30.416
It's what that leprechaun
was talking about.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.628
Will you stop with that
stupid leprechaun stuff?

28:33.629 --> 28:37.298
We found this gold. Finders keepers.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.551
I just hope it's real.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.803
I know how to tell if it's real.
You just bite on it.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.597
I seen it in a movie.

28:49.102 --> 28:52.146
Oh, my God.
I swallowed that gold coin.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.320
Nice going, Jaws.

28:55.525 --> 28:58.236
Hey, hey, hey, can you die
from swallowing gold?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.321
Yeah, after I kill you!

29:00.322 --> 29:03.157
Now, you just let me
take charge, okay?

29:03.158 --> 29:04.909
I'm just gonna keep one,

29:04.910 --> 29:08.120
and then I can get it checked out
in town and see if it's real or not.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.457
We're gonna hide the rest.
We can't tell anyone about this.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.460
Right, right. Why?

29:14.461 --> 29:18.172
'Cause you know how adults are,
especially when it comes to money.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.675
They'll just try to take it away.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.886
I got the perfect place to hide it...

29:23.887 --> 29:26.555
the old well beside the house.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.900
Hey, Ozzie, do you
know what this means?

29:30.644 --> 29:34.272
We're rich, and... and I
can buy comics every week.

29:34.273 --> 29:38.818
- Yeah, but you know what else?
- What else?

29:38.819 --> 29:41.362
We can get you an operation.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.990
- For what?
- To make you smart.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.075
See, we can go to the hospital

29:46.076 --> 29:48.536
and have them operate
and fix your brain.

29:48.537 --> 29:52.456
But... But I-I'm smart.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.918
Yeah, well, sort of.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.254
What I mean is,
we could make you real smart.

29:58.255 --> 30:01.474
That way, people won't
make fun of you.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.635
- They make fun of me?
- Not in front of you.

30:04.636 --> 30:09.232
Only behind your back.
Come on. Let's go the well.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.115
Come on!

30:29.328 --> 30:32.788
Um, wait. Here, start in the corners.

30:32.789 --> 30:36.793
Nice, even strokes.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.046
Wow. That's it.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.798
- You got it.
- Not bad?

30:42.799 --> 30:45.722
Yeah, yeah. A regular Picasso.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.013
Put me out of business.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.307
- Oh, need another can of paint.
- Oh, okay.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.726
Well, you just watch how
a pro gets a can of paint.

30:53.727 --> 30:57.276
All right. Let me get a rag first,
all right? Go ahead.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.331
Oh...

31:16.416 --> 31:18.338
Nathan.

31:22.464 --> 31:25.342
Nathan, come on. What are you doing?

31:30.013 --> 31:31.430
Oh, my God.

31:32.231 --> 31:34.934
Oh, what was that?

31:34.935 --> 31:37.186
Oh, geez.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.480
Honey, are you okay?
I heard you scream.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.024
I thought that was
you rubbing my leg.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.485
- And you let me?
- That's not the point.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.445
Something was rubbing my leg,

31:46.446 --> 31:49.657
like caressing it,
and it ran off over there.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.992
It's probably just an
old possum, honey.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.828
No, Dad, that was
not an animal, okay?

31:53.829 --> 31:56.747
I know what it feels like
when a man caresses my leg.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.165
You do?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.209
Look, we gotta get
these cuts cleaned up.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.586
Yeah, I should probably go
look for that animal?

32:02.587 --> 32:05.005
- Absolutely.
- Wait. Why?

32:05.006 --> 32:07.508
- Might have rabies.
- Great.

32:12.646 --> 32:14.098
It was a cat.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.892
I think we found your
secret admirer, honey.

32:17.593 --> 32:20.478
It wasn't a cat.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.023
Sounds hurt. Come on,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.152
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.779
Come on, kitty. Come on.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.830
Here kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.619
Here kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.205
Come on. Come on,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

32:39.206 --> 32:41.041
What? What?

32:41.042 --> 32:42.793
- What?
- The cat bit me!

32:42.794 --> 32:45.671
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Put pressure on it.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.882
- It bit me! It bit me!
- Oh, my God!

32:47.883 --> 32:50.634
- Stay there. Put pressure on it.
- Oh, my God!

32:50.635 --> 32:52.928
It's gonna be okay, Dad.
We're gonna take you to the hospital.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.930
- Truck. Ozzie, Alex!
- It bit me!

32:54.931 --> 32:57.475
We're taking him to the
emergency room, all right?

33:01.021 --> 33:03.398
Sit down, boy.

33:03.899 --> 33:06.025
Aw, man.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.651
- Oh, no!
- Come on.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.571
- Alex!
- Shoot! The distributor cap.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.494
Right.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.255
Come on, come on!

33:44.523 --> 33:46.398
Hey, guys, we may be a while, okay?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.275
So why don't you go get
a bite to eat at the café?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.778
- We'll see you in a bit.
- All right.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.783
- This is our chance.
- What, to get something to eat?

33:55.784 --> 33:58.160
- No, to check out the gold coin.
- Oh, yeah.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.379
- Come on. It's getting dark.
- Okay.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.438
I have never seen a coin like this.

34:21.935 --> 34:26.605
The symbols,
incredibly strange markings.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.733
Cut to the chase. What's it worth?

34:29.734 --> 34:33.112
Well, if this is solid gold,

34:33.112 --> 34:36.072
could be worth $500.

34:36.074 --> 34:40.327
But if there's historical value,

34:40.328 --> 34:43.914
it could be priceless.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.708
Could I keep this
overnight and study it?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.585
You won't lose it or
anything, will ya?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.920
No, no. I'll put it in my safe.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.382
I'll write up a receipt.

34:53.382 --> 34:56.176
You... You reckon that...
that coin

34:56.177 --> 34:59.806
might've come from a leprechaun?

35:00.390 --> 35:02.725
Never mind.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.643
Okay, we'll come back tomorrow.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.938
And let's just keep this between us.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.774
- Okay.
- We better get to the restaurant.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.744
They're gonna be pissed
we were gone so long.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.747
I must be hearing things.

36:11.336 --> 36:15.056
Well, okay. I'll get
this put away right now.

36:52.919 --> 36:56.593
Three left. Right.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.427
There we go.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.234
I want me gold coin!

37:13.523 --> 37:15.442
Me coin!

37:16.943 --> 37:21.155
It's not nice to steal gold
coins from a leprechaun.

37:21.156 --> 37:25.159
Bad shop owner. Bad shop owner.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.121
I'll be back.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.041
Now we're going to play.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.711
Do you want to play with me?

37:35.712 --> 37:37.296
Oh, no!

37:37.297 --> 37:40.300
No!

37:41.259 --> 37:46.897
This old lep, he played one
He played pogo on his lung

37:47.390 --> 37:49.850
Teach you to steal me gold.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.354
Aw.

37:54.355 --> 37:57.024
Can't have dirty shoes, now, can we?

38:02.030 --> 38:05.365
There. Nice and shiny.

38:05.366 --> 38:09.087
Oh. You'll bounce back in no time.

38:11.414 --> 38:15.244
One gold coin, 99 to go.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.297
By the luck of the Irish.

38:32.352 --> 38:37.105
<i>Oh, won't you please</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:41.819
<i>Be my four-leaf clover</i>

38:41.820 --> 38:46.198
<i>Can you be my lucky charm</i>

38:46.199 --> 38:49.493
Are you sure you told Ozzie
and Alex where this place is?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.286
I mean, they were
supposed to meet us here.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.497
Relax. They're kids.
Probably just stopped off

38:53.498 --> 38:55.624
to buy Ozzie a comic or something.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.460
Boy, what a night.

38:58.461 --> 39:02.214
My first day here, and my
father ends up in the hospital.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.801
Well, it's just for observation.
He'll be fine in the morning.

39:05.802 --> 39:10.222
Look on the bright side, Tory.
I mean, the worst is over.

39:10.223 --> 39:13.976
<i>Oh, won't you please</i>

40:15.955 --> 40:19.333
Say, aren't we a little
young to be out this late?

40:19.334 --> 40:22.628
No. I'm 600 years old.

40:22.829 --> 40:25.281
Okay, smartass.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.509
Why don't you take that ridiculous
mask off and step out of the car?

40:29.510 --> 40:32.930
It's not nice to make
fun of a leprechaun.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.266
Is that so?

40:36.267 --> 40:39.566
So now you're a leprechaun?

40:55.036 --> 40:56.954
You sure you don't want anything?

40:56.955 --> 41:00.374
No. I mean, yes, I do want something.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.794
What I wanted was a watercress salad

41:03.795 --> 41:07.047
and an Evian water,
but they don't have that here.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.217
All they have is cheap
whiskey and warm beer.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.391
Well, here's water.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.849
Geez. Thanks.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.864
Okay. Okay.

41:39.414 --> 41:42.082
Get away from me, you little creep!

41:42.083 --> 41:44.585
Get away!

41:50.341 --> 41:54.219
Oh, God! Okay.

42:13.156 --> 42:17.081
So, you want to play
hide-and-seek?

43:06.501 --> 43:08.510
Over here!

43:15.134 --> 43:17.603
I'm over here.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.248
Stop.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.855
Stop!

43:31.150 --> 43:33.401
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

43:33.402 --> 43:36.738
Leave me alone!

43:36.739 --> 43:39.867
Leave me alone!

43:58.010 --> 43:59.914
No more.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.934
No more.

44:05.935 --> 44:08.483
Where the fuck are you?

44:12.775 --> 44:15.494
Oh, thank God.

44:29.625 --> 44:32.544
Thank God...

44:39.135 --> 44:41.219
No! Oh, God!

44:52.481 --> 44:54.742
Now, that was fun.

44:55.943 --> 45:00.030
You know, Tory,
you look a little skinny.

45:00.031 --> 45:04.326
No offense, but,
you should have some meatloaf.

45:04.327 --> 45:06.912
- I got plenty, really.
- Oh, no.

45:06.913 --> 45:09.998
- Do you know what that is?
- Yeah, it's meatloaf.

45:09.999 --> 45:13.043
No, that's cut-up dead cow.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.587
Okay? And that's if you're
lucky, in this place.

45:15.588 --> 45:20.342
See, I don't eat meat,
and I don't kill living things.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.969
- I feel very strongly about that.
- Really?

45:22.970 --> 45:25.313
Really.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.808
All right.

45:28.309 --> 45:31.895
What are you... Nathan,
what are you doing?

45:31.896 --> 45:34.272
Cut-up dead cow. That's what
your shoe is, you know?

45:34.273 --> 45:36.320
Nathan, give me my shoe.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.070
Nathan, give me my shoe back!

45:40.071 --> 45:42.739
Come on! Look,
Alex and Ozzie are coming.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.784
Would you try to set
a mature example?

45:45.785 --> 45:47.619
Sorry we're late.

45:47.620 --> 45:50.830
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

45:50.831 --> 45:53.625
We were down over at that place.

46:03.427 --> 46:07.056
Now, where's me crock of gold?

46:13.479 --> 46:17.279
There.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.036
Dad!

46:32.540 --> 46:35.134
Daah! Bah!

46:38.369 --> 46:40.864
I want me gold!

47:25.051 --> 47:28.270
There.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.164
- Geez.
- Oh, God.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.508
What the...

47:59.001 --> 48:01.503
Oh, my God.

48:02.971 --> 48:05.006
I think something got in here.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.800
No shit, Sherlock.

48:06.801 --> 48:09.052
You better watch your
mouth and go wash it out

48:09.053 --> 48:11.596
with soap right now, boy.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.849
Sure. Sure.
And right after that, Ozzie,

48:14.850 --> 48:18.524
I'll be sure to ground
myself for two weeks.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.855
This is crazy.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.108
- What the hell's going on here?
- Well, it could've been a bear.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.527
They sometimes come down
from the hills looking for food.

48:25.528 --> 48:29.364
Great. My dad had to bring
food into this place.

48:29.365 --> 48:31.616
You know what? That leprechaun...

48:31.617 --> 48:34.953
he tried to shine my shoes,
and he said he was a shoemaker.

48:34.954 --> 48:38.039
Look, you guys can sit
around here and theorize...

48:38.040 --> 48:41.501
bear or no bear...
but I am getting out of here.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.753
As a matter of fact,
I'm walking out that door,

48:43.754 --> 48:46.256
and I'm not coming back.

48:55.641 --> 48:58.351
A little too dark out there.

48:58.352 --> 49:01.062
All right. Let's clean
this place up, all right?

49:01.063 --> 49:04.988
Here. You know how to
work one of these, right?

49:05.484 --> 49:08.737
Okay. Fellas.

49:15.244 --> 49:16.995
Man!

49:16.996 --> 49:19.247
Well, we finally got that
kitchen straightened up.

49:19.248 --> 49:23.251
Yeah. I'm really beginning to
get the hang of this thing.

49:25.337 --> 49:29.182
- What's that?
- Sounds like a bell.

49:42.937 --> 49:44.855
Look what I found.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.901
- Great, Ozzie.
- Great.

49:47.902 --> 49:50.153
I'm gonna go check out the bedrooms,

49:50.154 --> 49:52.405
find out where we're
gonna stay tonight.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.241
Oh, great. While you do that,
I'm gonna find my purse

49:55.242 --> 49:57.744
and check into a hotel.

50:05.377 --> 50:07.879
Alex,

50:07.880 --> 50:11.382
do you think you could
kill a leprechaun?

50:11.383 --> 50:13.968
Ozzie, you can kill anything.

50:13.969 --> 50:16.346
You just gotta know how to do it.

50:16.347 --> 50:19.516
Now, me? Give me a .357 Magnum,

50:19.517 --> 50:21.976
press it to the little
green critter's temple,

50:21.977 --> 50:23.895
and blam!

50:23.896 --> 50:26.523
Brains and guts and
oozing cruddy stuff

50:26.524 --> 50:28.733
dripping all down its head.

50:28.734 --> 50:31.578
The guy's gone with a capital "Dead."

50:39.537 --> 50:42.997
Ozzie, will you cut it out
with that stupid bell?

50:52.967 --> 50:55.890
Wait. It sounds like it's
coming from the kitchen.

51:12.403 --> 51:15.113
We're, like, really scared, okay?

51:15.114 --> 51:19.118
Stay here. I'm gonna check it out.

51:19.618 --> 51:22.120
Nathan, be careful.

52:00.341 --> 52:02.093
My leg!

52:04.413 --> 52:08.041
Caught you in a bear trap.

52:08.042 --> 52:10.126
I caught you in a bear trap.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.962
- You look like a stupid sap.
- What the hell are you?

52:14.363 --> 52:16.799
Oh, oh, it looks like you're hurt.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.844
Let's play surgeon.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.221
No!

52:33.484 --> 52:35.109
- Nathan!
- Tory, no!

52:35.110 --> 52:37.737
- Tory, get back!
- What the hell happened?

52:37.738 --> 52:39.697
- My leg!
- Oh, my God!

52:39.698 --> 52:41.700
Oh, my God!

52:42.701 --> 52:45.536
Oh, my God! Ozzie, call the police!
Call the police!

52:45.537 --> 52:47.706
Get off me!

52:48.707 --> 52:51.918
- You can't hurt me.
- Oh, my God!

52:54.254 --> 52:56.172
Alex, get the shotgun!

52:56.173 --> 52:58.257
All right! I'll get the shotgun.

52:58.258 --> 53:01.260
- Hurry up, Alex!
- Ozzie, it's me!

53:01.261 --> 53:03.346
- I gotta get the shotgun!
- Hurry!

53:03.347 --> 53:05.848
Help! Help! It's happening!

53:05.849 --> 53:09.227
The attack is on.
O'Grady farm. Send help.

53:09.228 --> 53:13.147
The... The leprechaun is attacking.
Army, navy, guns, marines.

53:13.148 --> 53:16.651
<i>- And we're gonna need some medicine.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

53:16.652 --> 53:20.822
Hey, Sheriff, I just got a call from Ozzie.
Says the leprechaun is attacking.

53:22.533 --> 53:26.160
What was it last week? Was it UFOs?

53:26.161 --> 53:28.372
No, no, it was Bigfoot.

53:29.373 --> 53:33.584
Well, you'll learn about Ozzie.
He's a good boy.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.180
A leprechaun.

53:37.381 --> 53:39.257
That's a good one.

53:39.258 --> 53:42.844
I'm coming! Here's the shotgun!

53:42.845 --> 53:44.254
Take it!

53:45.055 --> 53:47.683
Kill him! Kill him!

53:48.183 --> 53:49.701
Yeah!

53:52.602 --> 53:54.272
Ozzie, hurry up!

53:54.273 --> 53:56.607
- Get this thing off me!
- Ozzie, get Alex on the porch!

53:56.608 --> 53:59.610
- Come on, boy.
- I don't want to go to the porch!

54:07.327 --> 54:09.162
Okay!

54:09.163 --> 54:11.956
He went off through the bushes.

54:21.800 --> 54:26.726
God! Nathan,
that was no fucking bear.

54:34.438 --> 54:36.689
My God. It's gone.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.817
God, Nathan, your leg. Look at it.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.111
Oh, my God! Okay,
we gotta call a paramedic.

54:42.112 --> 54:45.740
Oh, I took care of it. I called them,
told them we needed the army

54:45.741 --> 54:48.409
and... and the medicine
and a paramedic.

54:48.410 --> 54:52.413
Ozzie... Ozzie, y-you didn't tell them
that it was a leprechaun, did you?

54:52.414 --> 54:55.708
Of course I did.
That's what it was, wasn't it?

54:55.709 --> 54:57.919
- Okay. Okay. All right.
- Oh, geez.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.424
All right. We just gotta get him
back to the house. Come on.

55:07.679 --> 55:10.473
Shit! The line's dead.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.434
- Alex, you a member of the Boy Scouts?
- Cub Scouts.

55:13.435 --> 55:15.812
Good enough. Okay,
you gotta help me with this.

55:15.813 --> 55:18.064
We gotta stop the bleeding.
Ozzie, go to the bathroom,

55:18.065 --> 55:22.068
get everything you can:
tissue, alcohol, cotton.

55:22.069 --> 55:25.696
Tory, did that thing look...
look like a leprechaun to you?

55:25.697 --> 55:29.200
- Ozzie, go!
- Come on, man.

55:29.201 --> 55:31.678
You're gonna be okay, Nathan.

55:32.079 --> 55:34.455
Okay. So, as soon as
we stop the bleeding,

55:34.456 --> 55:37.208
we're gonna take Nathan
out to the pickup.

55:37.209 --> 55:39.794
But what if that thing
is still out there?

55:39.795 --> 55:43.798
No way. I shot it. I put six
rounds into that thing.

55:43.799 --> 55:47.051
- Yeah. It's gotta be dead.
- Yeah.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.387
All right. Alex, go the fridge.
Get me some ice.

55:49.388 --> 55:52.107
It'll stop the swelling
on Nathan's leg.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.604
Alex, get the door.

55:58.605 --> 56:01.107
Come on.

56:01.108 --> 56:03.693
Hurry up and get him out of here!

56:03.694 --> 56:06.196
I don't see him.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.657
- Where is the old guy?
- Hurry.

56:09.658 --> 56:12.076
- Come on. Be careful.
- Hold on, Nathan.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.911
- Need help?
- Yeah.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.706
- Okay.
- Oh, God. Do you see him?

56:16.707 --> 56:20.552
- Oh, God, that hurts.
- Almost there.

56:21.253 --> 56:23.504
Hurry up! Get him in the truck!

56:23.505 --> 56:26.465
- What if he comes?
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Get in.

56:26.466 --> 56:28.593
Thanks.

56:28.594 --> 56:31.143
Nathan!

56:33.098 --> 56:35.896
- Okay. We made it.
- Yeah.

56:38.437 --> 56:41.606
- What's wrong with the truck?
- Oh, no!

56:41.607 --> 56:44.775
- Shit!
- The distributor cap.

56:51.199 --> 56:54.452
- Alex, be careful.
- Yeah.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.889
Hurry!

57:20.395 --> 57:22.438
- Let me in!
- Hurry! Get in!

57:22.439 --> 57:24.941
- Close the door!
- Roll up the window! Hurry!

57:24.942 --> 57:28.235
- Roll it up! Roll it up!
- I'm rolling! I'm rolling!

57:28.236 --> 57:30.739
Come on out and play, me friends!

57:38.412 --> 57:41.123
Get away! Get away!

57:42.124 --> 57:44.252
 No!

57:48.215 --> 57:50.433
Come on!

57:53.260 --> 57:56.640
Burn and die, you monster!

58:03.939 --> 58:07.817
My... My ear! He... He got my ear!

58:07.818 --> 58:09.813
Hey, chill!

58:13.115 --> 58:15.866
What the heck is he doing in there?

58:26.920 --> 58:30.172
Ring around the rosie,
a pocket full of posies

58:32.759 --> 58:34.744
Faster! Faster!

58:35.345 --> 58:37.138
No!

58:43.979 --> 58:48.524
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

59:04.082 --> 59:06.333
Where'd you go, me friends?

59:06.334 --> 59:09.170
I want to know where me gold is.

59:09.171 --> 59:14.017
Give it back to a nice
little harmless leprechaun.

59:14.509 --> 59:17.011
Okay. Let's go. Now.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.850
Where is he?

59:22.851 --> 59:25.525
Where are you going, me friends?

59:30.108 --> 59:33.194
Hurry!

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:03.265
- What are we gonna do now?
- Phone.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.727
- Phone. I gotta call for help.
- The phone is dead.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:10.732
The phone is dead. Okay. My portable!

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.033
Hello? I need the police.
This is an emergency.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:24.703
Yes. Hello. This is Tory Reding.
I'm calling from the O'Grady farm.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:27.123
Um, something really
terrible has happened,

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.750
and we need you to send
someone out here right away.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.963
Okay. Please hurry.
You've got... Hello?

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.674
Damn it! Okay. The battery died.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.968
- Oh, no!
- It's okay.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.846
I got through, and they're
gonna send somebody,

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:43.806
and we're gonna be okay.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.891
It's gonna be fine.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:49.862
Deputy Tripet, come in.
This is Sheriff Cronin.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:54.151
Tripet, do you read me?

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:57.403
<i>I read you, Sheriff. Yeah, go ahead.</i>

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.655
Yeah, yeah, this is Sheriff Cronin.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:05.244
We got a... a call from over
there at the O'Grady farm.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:08.914
A female, name of Tory Reding,
called in an emergency.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.042
Get out there on a code-one
priority right away.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:14.628
Roger, Sheriff.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:18.090
My ETA is less than three minutes.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.635
- If I need backup, I'll call it in.
- Roger, Tripet.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.387
You got the back door, right?

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.639
Right. And the basement
windows are locked up tight.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.893
All right. Now double-check
the windows in the kitchen.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:32.938
Oh, my ear sure hurts, Tory.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:36.066
I bet that leprechaun
made a boot out of it.

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:38.861
You're gonna be okay, Ozzie.
He didn't get your ear.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.114
- He just bit it.
- Where the hell are the police?

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:44.825
Well, they should be here by now.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.543
Okay.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.290
All right. Now, I'm gonna have to
make this a little tighter, okay?

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.958
Too tight?

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.085
No, it's all right. It's all right.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.421
Boy, that leprechaun sure is mean.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.674
It is not a leprechaun, damn it!

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:04.470
Ozzie, now, I admit I don't know
what the hell that thing was,

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.805
but it is not a leprechaun.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.600
Do you understand?

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:13.520
Well, what about the
gold in the old rusty car?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.983
Oh, ne-never mind what I just said.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.985
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:23.035
What do you...
What do you mean, gold?

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.119
Alex.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.332
Tell me, Alex. The gold?

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.294
We were gonna save it to get
Ozzie an operation to fix his brain.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:41.049
Alex, you can't fix Ozzie's brain.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.511
I know that, but he doesn't.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:48.097
Okay. Okay. Tell me about the gold.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.057
Okay. In the water bucket, right?

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.601
Right. Just pull it up,
and there's a bag of gold coins.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.853
Okay. This has gotta work.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:58.524
If all he wants is his gold,
he's gotta leave us alone.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.901
- Let's go. Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.861
- No, you're hurt too bad.
- Come on.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.698
- All right, all right.
- Sit down, Nathan.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.909
- Okay, look, take this gun with you, okay?
- Okay.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.370
Just cock it, aim it,
and pull the trigger.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:12.955
Okay.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.629
You ever work one of
those things before?

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.256
Nope.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.644
Watch out for those teeth.

01:04:33.243 --> 01:04:36.589
God! Come on. Come on.

01:04:40.926 --> 01:04:44.004
- Is that me gold?
- What the hell are you?

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:46.632
I'm a leprechaun, me dear.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:49.093
Here. This is what
you're looking for, right?

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.974
Me powers are returning.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.913
It sounds like me gold.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.083
It looks like me gold.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.835
It smells like me gold.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.914
It tastes like me gold.

01:05:21.144 --> 01:05:23.239
Oh, God!

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.921
Oh, God! Oh!

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.801
Me golden delicious gold.

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.888
Be calm. Be calm.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:38.308
Okay. He took it.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:40.227
Okay, so he got what he wanted.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:43.313
Now we can get everybody to
the hospital and, call for help.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:45.657
It's over.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.529
94...

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.990
95...

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.017
96...

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.954
Oh! 97...

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.582
And 98...

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.960
and 99...

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.050
A missing coin.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.928
I've been tricked.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.764
They've got me coin!

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:22.019
No one takes a leprechaun's gold.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:26.023
Oh, God. Alex, you gotta
get some ice for Ozzie's ear,

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.691
and boil up some water.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.401
I'll cover you.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.834
Put me down!

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.386
We're cooking now, kids.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.055
Ozzie!

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:01.105
Okay. Over there.

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:03.519
Oh, God, he's in the cabinets.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.397
Okay. Tory, I want you to open
it up and get back quickly, okay?

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.242
- Okay.
- Go.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.738
God!

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.990
I want me gold!

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.492
- Quick!
- Okay.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.788
Oh, God!

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.290
You should have picked
door number two, me lad.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:29.426
Okay. Okay.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.718
You missed me.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.388
- Oh, my God!
- Where is he?

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.599
- You can never catch a leprechaun.
- There he goes!

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.017
Come on.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.645
There he goes. He's getting away.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.647
- Where the hell did he go?
- He went in there!

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:51.776
Alex, go stay with Ozzie.

01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:01.323
Come on.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:15.049
Ho-ho-ho!

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:21.345
I'm right here, and I
ain't no Santa Claus.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.350
We got the sucker!

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.902
Nathan, be careful.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.541
You think it's dead?

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:55.421
Yeah. Yeah, he's dead.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.676
Not a chance, me lads!

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:02.856
Fiddle-dee diddle-dee dee,
a leprechaun me

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:09.653
All right. Hang on. Hang on.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.613
Okay. Okay.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.992
Okay.

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:32.292
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:35.011
I don't know.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.645
Oh, God!

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.602
Come on.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:53.104
Okay, where the hell is he?

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.857
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.110
Toward the basement.
Toward the basement!

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:01.071
No. Listen. Over here.

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:03.532
- Yeah, he's over there. I hear him.
- He's over there.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.843
Wait. No. Listen.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.912
All right. Okay, he's going
this way. Going this way.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.580
- Right here.
- Okay.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:13.417
Okay, come on, you little green
fucker, poke your head out.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.544
- Come on, you little...
- Where is he?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.173
- He went outside.
- He's gone.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.676
- Crap.
- He's gone.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:25.305
He's...

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:31.352
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:34.355
Do you hear anything?

01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:45.282
He's going down in the basement!

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.160
Hello, hello! Help us, please!

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.370
Come help us!
We're trapped inside of here!

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:52.622
<i>Where's the rest of me gold?</i>

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.102
<i>Having problems?</i>

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.071
<i>Do you need a hand?</i>

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:22.611
God, I don't get what
the fuck's going on!

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.955
I gave him his gold!

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.241
I gave him his gold!

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:31.953
I... I think I know what he wants.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.580
What?

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:37.210
He... He wants his last gold coin.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.253
Stop him! He's got the last
gold coin in his stomach!

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:43.924
Ozzie, come on!
You can't go out there!

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.926
There's gotta be another way.

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.804
That thing is a leprechaun,
and we've gotta find a way to stop it!

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:52.474
Wait. Old man O'Grady.
He might know how to kill it.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.768
- What?
- When I was a little kid,

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:58.230
he used to tell me stories
about fairies and leprechauns.

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:01.525
If anybody would know how
to kill this thing, he would.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:04.945
He owned this house. He...
He probably put that thing in its crate.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:07.405
- Well, where is he?
- Old man O'Grady

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:10.408
is in a rest home at the end of town.

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.702
He had a stroke about...
what... 10 years ago.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.205
Well, then we gotta go there.
We gotta go there right now!

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.792
- How we gonna get there?
- The jeep. Okay...

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.341
Wait a sec. Wait. I got an idea.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.511
Okay.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.014
Alex, keep the door unlocked.

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:04.092
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:10.162
Hello, love!

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.226
Farther! Come on!

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.525
Oh.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.231
Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.700
Shiny, shiny.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.737
Oh.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.281
Good.

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:35.753
- Okay, Tory, we're clear.
- Okay. I'll be back.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.507
Oh.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:20.089
No! No! No!

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.779
Oh, God.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.097
O'Grady, O'Grady.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.975
Dan O'Grady.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.359
Mr. O'Grady?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.737
It's out. It's out of the crate.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.405
You believe it.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:03.535
No one believed it was a leprechaun.

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:06.538
I believe it. How do we stop it?

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.540
There's only one way...

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:12.043
one way to kill a leprechaun...
but I'm not going to tell ya.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.796
What?

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:17.967
I'll never tell ya!

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.810
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:37.485
No! Oh!

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:41.035
Oh, God! Oh!

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.304
Oh! Oh! Come on! Open, open, open!

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.302
Come on! Oh!

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:18.485
Oh, God. Oh...

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.488
No!

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:25.825
He came back for me.

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:27.702
I knew he would,

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:32.415
but no-nobody would believe me.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.084
God, we've gotta get you down.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:40.089
No. No. It's too...
too late for that now.

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:43.092
But you have to...
you have to kill it.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:45.178
How? How can we kill it?

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:48.473
A four-leaf clover,

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:52.977
freshly plucked from the clover patch

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.563
beside the well.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.399
You gotta put it on his body.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.069
It has to touch him.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.906
Then you can kill him.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.324
Okay.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.825
No...

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.495
No...

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:12.015
Little girls shouldn't look
for four-leaf clovers.

01:20:23.901 --> 01:20:25.728
Come to me, me dear.

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.459
Oh, G...

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.385
Oh, my God, a cop! Oh, my God, a cop!

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:50.136
Help! Please!

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.388
You gotta help us! Please help us!

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:56.351
Please! Please! Oh, my God!
You've gotta help us!

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.312
Oh, my God, no!

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.154
I want me gold!

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.923
Oh! No!

01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:22.131
Oh, no! Get out! Please get out!

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:39.407
An eye for an eye, me dear.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:44.857
Oh, please, please get out!

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.408
Tory!

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.660
- We heard your screams.
- Oh, my God.

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:58.037
- Where's Alex?
- He's okay. He's up in the house.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.706
- He's safe.
- Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.625
O'Grady said that we need
to have a four-leaf clover.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.335
A four-leaf clover will
kill the leprechaun.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.629
We better get outta here
before that thing wakes up.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:09.757
Okay. There's gotta be a four-leaf
clover in the patch up there.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.509
- He said there was.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.432
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.059
Whoa, look at this, you guys!

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.687
We're never gonna find
a four-leaf clover in here.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.737
Yes, we can. I found one
once when I was a kid.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.206
- Hey!
- What?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.034
Oh, never mind.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:39.835
Oh, God, Ozzie!

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.127
I gotta get him.

01:22:47.828 --> 01:22:51.800
I'm not afraid.
I can get that leprechaun.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.728
Please don't be here yet.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:09.243
I know I can get him. I'm not afraid.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.529
I'm gonna kill him.

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:16.240
I can get him. I can get him.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.743
I'm not afraid.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.261
Forget it. We're not gonna find it.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:40.848
Y-You can, too, find it.
You just gotta believe.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.600
Damn it, Ozzie!

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:46.437
I'm so sick of your magic
and your stupid fantasies!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.190
Okay, it's too late for that now!
We don't have time

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:52.527
to sit here in a damn clover
patch and look for clovers!

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:56.280
- That thing is gonna wake up!
- You've lost your faith.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.283
You gotta believe. You got to.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.702
All right, Ozzie. Here. Look.
Here. Look.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:04.501
I believe. I believe!

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.963
Look. You... You found one!

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:15.341
I told you. I told you!

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:16.884
Yes!

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.433
- We've gotta get this on the leprechaun!
- Yeah! Come on!

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.108
Top o' the morning, me lad!

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:35.903
- Please! Let go! Let go!
- Now I'll finish what I started.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:39.740
- Get down!
- Help! Please!

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:43.244
Nathan! Ozzie! Please,
somebody help me!

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:47.498
He's gonna kill me!
Let go! Please, help!

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.917
No! It's me!

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.628
It's me you want, you little
green son of a bitch!

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:56.215
I've got the last gold coin.
I swallowed it. It's in my stomach.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.337
Then it's your belly I want.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.889
- Use the clover! Use the clover!
- How's your leg?

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:05.725
Are you okay?

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:08.603
- Wait! No!
- I gotta go see Ozzie!

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.106
Alex!

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:26.329
I want me last coin!

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.539
Me gold!

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.292
Hang on, Ozzie! I'll save you!
One second!

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:34.295
I'll save you! Hang on! Hey, lep!

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.759
Fuck you, Lucky Charms.

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:21.009
We did it.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:27.056
I did a smart thing. I did
a smart thing, didn't I?

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.266
You're really smart, Ozzie.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.519
You just hang in there, okay?

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.900
Hey, Alex, what's that?

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:41.153
Gotcha.

01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:43.239
First time I ever got ya.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.287
You sure did, Ozzie.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:55.126
I want me gold!

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.925
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.120
<i>I'll not rest till I have me gold.</i>

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:16.332
<i>Curse this well
that me soul shall dwell</i>

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:21.509
<i>till I find me magic
that breaks me spell.</i>
