00:01.345 --> 00:03.056
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:03.057 --> 00:06.299
I remember when I was a little girl
working on my daddy's farm.

00:06.301 --> 00:07.735
Oh, please don't
tell me a story...

00:07.736 --> 00:08.969
Let me tell you a story.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.871
I was a meek little thing,

00:10.872 --> 00:13.874
scared of my own shadow
and the sheep I had to castrate.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.911
That's where you learned it?

00:16.912 --> 00:20.848
Just when I thought my life
couldn't possibly get any worse,

00:20.849 --> 00:24.251
a city fella in a '56 Rambler
pulled up to the house

00:24.252 --> 00:26.086
and asked for directions.

00:26.087 --> 00:28.522
- Was that Mike's dad?
- Hell no.

00:28.523 --> 00:30.758
This was a real man.

00:30.759 --> 00:33.394
Wore a three-piece suit
with hard shoes

00:33.395 --> 00:37.431
and smelled like a pine forest
after a spring rain.

00:37.432 --> 00:39.299
That's very poetic, Peggy.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.101
What he did to me wasn't poetic.

00:41.102 --> 00:42.769
It was filthy.

00:42.770 --> 00:43.670
And I loved it.

00:43.671 --> 00:46.106
All right, wait, wait,
wait.

00:46.107 --> 00:47.741
Got to write it down. Go.

00:47.742 --> 00:50.077
MIKE: <i>Look at you,</i>
writing again.

00:50.078 --> 00:52.144
Yeah, new story...
about a young girl

00:52.146 --> 00:53.814
coming of age
on a hardscrabble farm

00:53.815 --> 00:55.682
at the base of
the Mudlick mountains.

00:55.683 --> 00:56.883
Mudlick? That-that's weird.

00:56.884 --> 00:59.518
My mom grew up on a farm
in Mudlick.

01:01.988 --> 01:04.090
Oh, no!

01:08.361 --> 01:10.230
No.

01:10.231 --> 01:12.299
Really?

01:12.300 --> 01:14.266
Come on.

01:14.268 --> 01:16.937
Is there anything about
these pages that you do like?

01:16.938 --> 01:18.538
Hold on.

01:18.539 --> 01:20.739
Nope!

01:20.741 --> 01:22.943
Well, this is your life
you're crapping on.

01:22.944 --> 01:24.644
I just wrote it down.

01:24.645 --> 01:26.112
You got Mudlick all wrong.

01:26.113 --> 01:27.513
The people, the geography.

01:27.515 --> 01:30.884
How the heck did I get
from the barn dance to the car

01:30.885 --> 01:33.486
to consummate
my forbidden love with Troy

01:33.487 --> 01:35.588
when it was parked
up on McGrainey Hill?

01:35.589 --> 01:37.157
You ran! Okay...

01:37.158 --> 01:38.725
"Fueled by a burning lust

01:38.726 --> 01:40.426
that would soon consume
both of them."

01:40.427 --> 01:43.162
Now, that is a great line,
and I'm not cutting it.

01:43.164 --> 01:46.766
Why did I spend all that time
drawing you a map of Mudlick

01:46.767 --> 01:48.100
if you're not gonna use it?

01:48.102 --> 01:50.270
Really? You want to
talk about the map?

01:50.271 --> 01:51.504
Let's look at that map.

01:51.505 --> 01:52.772
Oh, here we go.

01:52.773 --> 01:57.576
"Home," "big tree," "crick."

01:57.578 --> 01:59.879
Well, if you know where
two out of three of those are,

01:59.880 --> 02:01.514
you can find your way anywhere.

02:01.515 --> 02:04.117
It's called triangulationing.

02:04.118 --> 02:06.319
This is not a map, Peggy.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.955
This is a taunt
from a serial killer.

02:08.955 --> 02:10.923
Okay, we have to go there.

02:10.924 --> 02:12.357
What are you talking about?

02:12.359 --> 02:13.860
Road trip, Peggy.

02:13.861 --> 02:15.093
We're going to Mudlick.

02:15.095 --> 02:17.229
I'm not going
back to that hellhole.

02:17.231 --> 02:21.100
Your name can go first
on the title page.

02:21.101 --> 02:22.602
Read your contract.

02:22.603 --> 02:24.971
I got that months ago.

02:24.972 --> 02:26.806
Seriously?

02:26.807 --> 02:29.407
I got to stop using Vince
as a lawyer.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.125
I have to see
Mudlick for myself.

03:04.126 --> 03:07.395
When Hemingway wrote about Paris,
he walked those streets.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.862
It's what made it authentic.

03:08.864 --> 03:10.565
Well, Mudlick is no Paris.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.167
Although my mom said the mayor
used to wear a beret

03:13.168 --> 03:15.570
to hide the dent in his skull.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.571
I'm surprised you got her to go.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.740
Well, it wasn't easy.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.575
Oh, by the way,
you have to take her to church

03:20.576 --> 03:21.975
for the next six months.

03:21.977 --> 03:24.644
Which day?
She goes three times a week.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.482
Aw, come on!

03:27.483 --> 03:29.383
Well, hey, you got off easy.

03:29.384 --> 03:31.718
I've got to hand-wash
all her bras before we leave.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.421
Do 'em right or she'll make you
do 'em again.

03:35.489 --> 03:38.092
You know, she still has
a sister down in Mudlick.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.527
No, I didn't know that.

03:39.528 --> 03:41.762
See, that's the kind of stuff
I'm hoping to dig into

03:41.763 --> 03:43.496
when I drag her down there.
Ugh.

03:43.498 --> 03:45.733
I'd rather wash her bras
for the next hundred years.

03:45.734 --> 03:48.468
Although that-that's me.
I got a system.

03:48.470 --> 03:52.339
Believe me, Mudlick is not my first
choice in vacation destinations.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.073
But I think it's important
for the book.

03:54.075 --> 03:55.743
Just keep in mind,
it's a long drive.

03:55.744 --> 03:58.011
Don't let Mom drink milk
or she'll get carsick.

03:58.013 --> 03:59.847
Or listen to music,
she'll get carsick.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.649
And every 30 miles or so, you got
to stop and let her run around.

04:02.651 --> 04:04.851
Or she'll get carsick?
Worse.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.053
What's worse
than getting carsick?

04:07.055 --> 04:08.088
Never mind.

04:08.089 --> 04:11.024
Just remember, every 30 miles.

04:19.065 --> 04:22.403
Watch your speed.
Watch your speed!

04:22.404 --> 04:24.371
I am going the limit.

04:24.372 --> 04:25.539
(gasps)

04:25.540 --> 04:27.207
What?! What is it?

04:27.208 --> 04:28.642
Did you not see that sign?

04:28.643 --> 04:30.309
You're barreling
through a deer crossing.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.645
There are no deer!

04:31.646 --> 04:32.646
Oh, really?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.482
I guess you know more than the Missouri
Department of Roads.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.351
No, I just...

04:37.352 --> 04:38.285
Okay.

04:38.286 --> 04:41.754
I'm gonna look out for deer!

04:41.756 --> 04:43.290
These woods are full of them.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.790
They breed like immigrants.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.727
Oh, my God.

04:46.728 --> 04:49.596
Listen, Peggy, I know that you
are reluctant to go back home,

04:49.597 --> 04:52.899
but I think it's gonna be
good for the book and for you.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.201
What the hell's wrong with me?

04:54.202 --> 04:56.303
Nothing! You're perfect!

04:56.304 --> 04:57.471
(gasps)

04:57.472 --> 04:58.972
What?!

04:58.973 --> 05:00.674
I think I need to run around.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.775
It's been 30 miles.

05:01.776 --> 05:03.443
Ah, you and me both.

05:03.444 --> 05:04.977
(gasping)

05:07.614 --> 05:10.116
Carl, hurry up!
Tip-off's about to start.

05:10.117 --> 05:11.750
Damn it, I love March Madness.

05:11.752 --> 05:15.387
Lets guys like me pretend we got
something to do with college.

05:15.389 --> 05:18.058
Yep, nothing I like better
than watching hoops

05:18.059 --> 05:19.892
on a Saturday with
my boys, am I right?

05:19.894 --> 05:21.294
Carl, you want
to go shoe shopping?

05:21.295 --> 05:23.697
Sure thing, baby.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.733
Nothing I like better than shoe
shopping on a Saturday with my lady.

05:27.735 --> 05:30.002
Record that nonsense.
Help a brother out.

05:31.204 --> 05:33.339
Poor sap.
Boy, do I remember those days,

05:33.340 --> 05:35.541
being dragged around
by the old ball and chain.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.042
Your wife's only been gone
five hours.

05:37.044 --> 05:39.646
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

05:39.647 --> 05:42.382
(phone ringing)

05:42.383 --> 05:45.185
Ooh, I got to take this.

05:45.186 --> 05:46.852
Hey, Philly.

05:46.854 --> 05:48.321
What's the spread?

05:48.322 --> 05:51.290
Okay, uh,
give me a half-dollar on Gonzaga

05:51.291 --> 05:53.659
and I'll take the over
on the Kansas game,

05:53.660 --> 05:55.695
and I'll call you later
to lay down a trixie

05:55.696 --> 05:58.230
with UConn, Villanova
and Syracuse.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.631
All right.

06:03.269 --> 06:06.505
Wrong number.
(chuckles)

06:06.507 --> 06:08.074
Look, I know it was your bookie.

06:08.075 --> 06:09.174
What did all that mean?

06:09.176 --> 06:10.408
You wearing a wire?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.014
Just tell me.

06:16.016 --> 06:17.683
All right.

06:17.684 --> 06:20.386
A half dollar is 50 bucks,
which I put on Gonzaga.

06:20.387 --> 06:24.724
Then I bet that the total points
in the Kansas game will be over 140.

06:24.725 --> 06:26.892
And I have no idea
what the trixie is,

06:26.893 --> 06:29.427
but if you win, it's,
like, a ton of money.

06:30.496 --> 06:32.698
Man, I wish I would have bet
on my bracket last year.

06:32.699 --> 06:34.633
I picked all the way down
to the Final Four.

06:34.634 --> 06:35.834
I would've made bank.

06:35.836 --> 06:37.503
Believe me, you don't
want to start betting.

06:37.504 --> 06:39.171
You have
an addictive personality.

06:39.172 --> 06:42.641
I can see it in your stomach.

06:42.642 --> 06:43.642
Come on!

06:43.643 --> 06:44.810
I'm a grown man.

06:44.811 --> 06:48.513
I can do whatever I want,
until my wife gets back.

06:48.515 --> 06:49.982
You really want
to go down this road?

06:49.983 --> 06:50.948
Why not?

06:50.950 --> 06:52.318
I know sports.

06:52.319 --> 06:54.319
All I need is for you to walk me
through the betting process.

06:54.321 --> 06:56.188
Okay, but if I do this,
remember,

06:56.189 --> 06:58.090
you pay attention,
you do what I say,

06:58.091 --> 07:02.494
and you never, ever tell
our wives how much we lose.

07:02.495 --> 07:04.595
Or win.

07:04.597 --> 07:06.431
You're a natural.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.842
Oh, God!

07:16.843 --> 07:18.409
Who the hell are you?!

07:18.411 --> 07:19.611
Molly, T-Bone.

07:19.612 --> 07:20.846
T-Bone, Molly.

07:20.847 --> 07:22.381
Pleasure.

07:22.382 --> 07:24.248
Why is he in our car?

07:24.250 --> 07:25.750
He needed a ride.

07:25.752 --> 07:27.386
To where? His killing grounds?

07:27.387 --> 07:28.552
(scoffs)

07:28.554 --> 07:31.356
I was a thumb jockey
myself back in the day.

07:31.357 --> 07:32.690
That right?
Mm.

07:32.692 --> 07:36.161
17-year-old girl
all alone on the highway.

07:36.162 --> 07:38.029
I wasn't worried.

07:38.030 --> 07:41.098
People were kind back then;
I think they still are.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.767
Somebody's hair
smells delicious.

07:42.768 --> 07:45.069
Okay, here's your stop, T-Bone.

07:51.543 --> 07:55.647
Well, that was
the nickel tour of Mudlick.

07:55.648 --> 07:57.282
Gotten used to the smell yet?

07:57.283 --> 08:01.052
Well, I have to admit, there's a...
there's a certain funk.

08:01.053 --> 08:04.522
Are you sure we didn't
step in something?

08:04.523 --> 08:05.924
You stepped in Mudlick.

08:05.925 --> 08:09.427
There's no scraping that off.

08:09.428 --> 08:12.664
I told you this trip
was gonna be a waste of time.

08:12.665 --> 08:14.432
No, no, no, don't give up yet.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.900
I mean, what about this place?

08:15.901 --> 08:17.302
Is this bringing
up any, you know,

08:17.303 --> 08:19.303
good childhood memories?
Yeah.

08:19.305 --> 08:22.973
Daddy didn't let us come here
because they served chop suey.

08:24.642 --> 08:26.177
Horrible racist.

08:26.178 --> 08:28.779
He wouldn't even eat off china.

08:30.581 --> 08:33.517
Said the woman who won't
eat Swedish meatballs.

08:33.519 --> 08:36.453
Well, sometimes,
when I was feeling down,

08:36.455 --> 08:39.690
I used to sneak in here
by myself and order a malted.

08:39.691 --> 08:41.225
Wow.

08:41.226 --> 08:45.028
That is the first memory of Mudlick
that's actually pleasant.

08:45.030 --> 08:48.665
The man who owned this place
lost both his legs to diabetes.

08:50.468 --> 08:53.203
And we're back.

08:54.038 --> 08:55.773
Welcome to Stumpy's.

08:55.774 --> 08:59.176
Can I take your order?

08:59.177 --> 09:04.381
Uh... my daddy's dead, so
I'll have the chop suey.

09:04.383 --> 09:06.484
Uh, chef salad.

09:06.485 --> 09:09.720
You know, my mother-in-law here
is originally from Mudlick.

09:09.721 --> 09:11.722
Yeah? What part?

09:11.723 --> 09:13.090
North of the tree.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.524
Hmm.

09:15.359 --> 09:17.061
La-Di-da.

09:17.062 --> 09:18.928
Mudlick royalty.

09:18.930 --> 09:22.465
Sounds to me like the whining
of a crick person.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.934
All right, all right, ladies.

09:23.935 --> 09:28.204
The crick waters the tree,
and the tree shades the crick, and...

09:28.206 --> 09:29.373
What is she talking about?

09:29.374 --> 09:31.008
They're five miles
away from each other.

09:31.009 --> 09:32.842
Don't bother.
She can't read a map.

09:37.715 --> 09:41.218
BOTH: Five, four,
three, two, one!

09:41.219 --> 09:43.220
(buzzer blares) (both cheering)

09:43.221 --> 09:44.588
(laughing)

09:44.589 --> 09:45.756
Yeah!

09:45.757 --> 09:46.957
Now I understand

09:46.958 --> 09:48.759
how people lose their families
to gambling addictions.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.593
This is so much fun.

09:50.595 --> 09:52.262
First time out, you're a winner.

09:52.263 --> 09:53.297
Pretty great, huh?

09:53.298 --> 09:54.730
It's awesome!

09:54.732 --> 09:56.866
Worst thing
that could've happened to you.

09:56.868 --> 09:59.635
You'll be chasing
that the rest of your life.

09:59.637 --> 10:02.105
Well, let's chase,
let's chase, let's chase!

10:02.106 --> 10:03.640
(laughs) Okay, look.

10:03.641 --> 10:04.808
The Duke game is next.

10:04.809 --> 10:06.075
Put-put another bet in for me.

10:06.077 --> 10:08.078
Not me, you; you're
placing the next one.

10:08.079 --> 10:09.746
Time to take off
the training wheels.

10:09.747 --> 10:12.348
No, no, no, it's too soon.

10:12.350 --> 10:16.152
Listen, this is something you
need to learn for when I'm gone.

10:17.654 --> 10:20.122
I'm not always gonna be
around to coddle you.

10:20.124 --> 10:21.724
No, no, I'm not ready.
You'll be fine.

10:21.726 --> 10:24.761
Just do like I taught you.

10:24.762 --> 10:26.930
Hi.

10:26.931 --> 10:28.832
How are you?

10:28.833 --> 10:30.800
It's not a sex chat.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.602
Place the damn bet.

10:32.603 --> 10:38.308
Uh, yes, this is client 3464, and-and
I would like to place a bet.

10:38.309 --> 10:39.476
Oh, look at you.

10:39.477 --> 10:41.944
My little bird's
leaving the nest.

10:41.946 --> 10:45.515
Yes, uh, I would like
Duke minus the six,

10:45.516 --> 10:48.451
and, uh, what's the over-under
on the UConn game?

10:48.452 --> 10:50.286
Keep going;
I'm gonna grab my camera.

10:50.287 --> 10:52.654
You don't get moments
like these back.

10:58.928 --> 11:02.432
Before we leave Mudlick, there's just
one more stop I want to make.

11:02.433 --> 11:05.434
I told you you should've used
the can at the diner.

11:05.436 --> 11:07.637
I did, and you could've
at least warned me

11:07.638 --> 11:10.406
it was an actual can, but...

11:10.407 --> 11:13.141
This stop is for you, Peggy.

11:14.143 --> 11:16.077
Where the hell are we?

11:16.079 --> 11:19.682
In that house is someone that
you have not seen in 50 years

11:19.683 --> 11:22.385
who misses you very much.

11:22.386 --> 11:24.052
What did you do?

11:24.054 --> 11:27.190
I may have bribed
a certain crick waitress

11:27.191 --> 11:29.992
to give me the phone number for
Rosemary Ritter, your sister,

11:29.993 --> 11:32.895
and that's her house!

11:32.896 --> 11:34.363
(giggles)

11:34.364 --> 11:35.698
You talked to my sister?

11:35.699 --> 11:38.601
Yes, I did, and she's waiting
right in there for you!

11:38.602 --> 11:40.001
(chuckles)

11:40.836 --> 11:44.340
Okay. Okay.

11:44.341 --> 11:46.776
I guess this
had to happen sometime.

11:46.777 --> 11:48.410
Go tell her I'm coming in.

11:48.411 --> 11:50.946
I need a minute
to collect myself.

11:50.947 --> 11:52.715
Sure, sure.

11:52.716 --> 11:54.916
I'm proud of you.

12:00.489 --> 12:03.926
Molly Flynn,
you've done it again.

12:03.927 --> 12:05.794
(engine starts)

12:05.795 --> 12:06.695
Hey!

12:06.696 --> 12:08.096
Hey!

12:08.898 --> 12:10.266
(sputters)

12:10.267 --> 12:13.635
Son of a bitch!

12:13.636 --> 12:15.136
(coughs)

12:23.845 --> 12:26.012
(doorbell rings)

12:30.351 --> 12:32.186
Can I help you?

12:32.187 --> 12:33.821
Hey.

12:33.822 --> 12:35.089
Hi. Molly Flynn.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.391
We spoke on the phone earlier.

12:37.392 --> 12:38.526
I hung up on you.

12:38.527 --> 12:43.930
Yes, you did, and that's what told
me you were the right lady.

12:43.932 --> 12:47.067
And I told you
I didn't want to see Peggy.

12:47.069 --> 12:48.936
Well, then you'll be
very happy to know

12:48.937 --> 12:51.639
she feels the exact same way
about you.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.339
So she's not here?

12:53.341 --> 12:58.311
No, she peeled out like a bat out of...
well, Mudlick.

12:58.313 --> 13:00.114
Well, why didn't you
say so, honey?

13:00.115 --> 13:01.481
Come on in!

13:02.716 --> 13:05.718
Oh, it's always good
seeing family.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.921
Oh!

13:07.922 --> 13:10.524
I'm so sorry about all of this.

13:10.525 --> 13:13.294
I don't know
what I thought would happen.

13:13.295 --> 13:16.930
I don't mean to be judgmental,
but you don't seem to think too hard

13:16.931 --> 13:19.732
before you jump into things.

13:19.734 --> 13:21.734
Well, not when it comes
to healing family.

13:21.736 --> 13:23.704
I got to admit, I never
thought I'd see the day

13:23.705 --> 13:25.339
when Peggy would
come back to Mudlick.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.274
I figured the next
time we'd meet,

13:27.275 --> 13:29.109
there'd be six feet
of dirt between us

13:29.110 --> 13:32.111
and one of us would be dancing.

13:32.113 --> 13:35.081
What in the world happened
between you two?

13:35.083 --> 13:37.851
You really get that nose
right up in there, don't you?

13:37.852 --> 13:39.953
Well, yes, but respectfully.

13:39.954 --> 13:43.590
Just-just tell me the story,
and I won't have any judgment

13:43.591 --> 13:45.424
on what you might have
done to her.

13:45.426 --> 13:47.494
What I did to her?

13:47.495 --> 13:52.465
I'm sorry, but did she ever
mention a man named Troy to you?

13:52.467 --> 13:54.768
Oh, yeah,
Troy that she ran away with.

13:54.769 --> 13:56.268
Her first love.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.771
Yeah, well, he might've
been her first love,

13:57.772 --> 13:59.673
but she didn't love him first.

13:59.674 --> 14:03.709
Troy was my fiancé till Peggy
stole him away from me.

14:03.711 --> 14:05.611
What?
My little sister

14:05.613 --> 14:08.615
took my lover, my friend,

14:08.616 --> 14:11.151
my everything.

14:11.152 --> 14:13.319
Oh, my God.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.156
We have an ending for our book!

14:19.059 --> 14:21.860
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.733
For a crick person, you sure
know how to mix a malted.

14:27.735 --> 14:31.203
Enjoy the surprise
at the bottom.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.577
There she is.

14:38.579 --> 14:40.846
Rosie?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.549
You slut! I'll kill you!

14:48.421 --> 14:49.921
Hey! Hey!

14:49.923 --> 14:51.891
(groaning)

14:51.892 --> 14:52.992
Ladies! Ladies!

14:52.993 --> 14:54.226
A little decorum!

14:54.228 --> 14:55.695
You are better than this.

14:55.696 --> 14:57.863
Oh! Oh!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.435
Defense, defense, lock them out!

15:02.436 --> 15:04.336
Come on, you gangly bastards.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.472
I made you boys sandwiches.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.673
Get out, you jinx!

15:10.376 --> 15:13.879
Well, if you want them later,
they'll be in the garbage.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.615
(buzzer blares)

15:15.616 --> 15:18.317
Ah, damn it!
How did he miss that shot?!

15:18.318 --> 15:19.552
I blame Joyce!

15:19.553 --> 15:21.720
Her juju was still in the room!

15:21.722 --> 15:26.025
Well, you won't see my juju,
my ta-tas or my boom-boom

15:26.026 --> 15:28.426
for quite a while.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.597
Okay, okay, it's for the best.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.264
You got a taste of losing.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.168
It's not how you handle the win,
it's how you handle the loss.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.937
Actually, it's not that bad.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.905
I chickened out on that $50 bet

15:39.906 --> 15:41.906
and told Philly
to just make it a dime.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.443
You what now?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.077
A dime, ten bucks.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.313
A dime's a grand,
you big cement head!

15:49.148 --> 15:50.281
What?!

15:50.283 --> 15:52.384
You just lost $1,000!

15:52.385 --> 15:53.519
1,000 bucks?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.721
Why did they come up
with these stupid code words?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.922
Because it's illegal!

15:58.924 --> 16:02.594
I leave the room for eight seconds,
and you screw the pooch.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.562
Hey, I told you I wasn't ready.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.597
That's why I said only bet 50.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.799
And a dime is ten.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.467
In what world is a dime not ten?

16:09.469 --> 16:13.738
In a world where a guy breaks
your thumbs when you can't pay it back!

16:15.541 --> 16:17.709
Enough! Okay!

16:17.710 --> 16:19.344
We've got the anger out.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.946
That's good.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.681
That's healthy.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.717
Now let's... let's let
the healing begin.

16:28.353 --> 16:30.020
You gonna say something?

16:30.022 --> 16:32.623
You look old.

16:33.825 --> 16:35.260
You have a man's haircut.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.294
Okay.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.995
Okay.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.332
That's good, we're talking.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.501
Okay, let's take it
to the table.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.136
None of this was my idea.

16:45.137 --> 16:48.173
I would've been fine if
I never saw this place again.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.309
Where do you get off acting like you
were the one who was wronged?

16:51.310 --> 16:52.877
What happened happened.

16:52.878 --> 16:53.944
MOLLY: Okay.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.613
It's clear that you two
need to talk,

16:56.615 --> 16:59.217
so I'm-I'm just gonna go
over here, out of your way,

16:59.218 --> 17:02.486
just quietly taking notes
on the book.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.455
What's there to talk about?

17:05.457 --> 17:07.089
She stole my fiancé.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.827
I didn't steal him;
he came to me.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.063
And you didn't send him away.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.765
He told me he loved me.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.335
If you recall, growing up
we didn't hear that a lot.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.303
I used to say it to you.

17:21.472 --> 17:24.540
I remember.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.413
Why didn't you ever call me?

17:29.415 --> 17:31.449
Oh, why do you think?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.251
I was wracked with guilt.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.051
I was so stupid.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.054
You were 16.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.588
And stupid.

17:40.258 --> 17:42.526
"And stupid."

17:48.432 --> 17:53.404
If it helps, I couldn't be happier
the way my life turned out.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.641
I found a good husband
who gave me six wonderful kids

17:56.642 --> 18:00.343
and loved me
till the day he died.

18:01.178 --> 18:03.179
That makes me so happy.

18:04.648 --> 18:09.386
If it makes you feel any better,
Troy left me soon after we took off.

18:09.387 --> 18:13.389
I married a philandering husband
who left me for an actual whore.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.963
"Actual whore."

18:26.704 --> 18:29.406
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

18:29.407 --> 18:32.375
You and I were always different.

18:37.281 --> 18:40.483
Let's not forget
who made this possible.

18:46.990 --> 18:49.725
Tree people.

19:01.456 --> 19:02.925
(basketball game playing on TV)

19:02.926 --> 19:04.593
You watching
the North Carolina game?

19:04.594 --> 19:05.894
Yeah.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.195
The spread's six points.

19:07.196 --> 19:08.297
I don't care.

19:08.298 --> 19:10.098
I just want to enjoy the game.

19:10.099 --> 19:12.166
You can still do
that without money on it?

19:12.968 --> 19:14.636
Yes, you can.

19:14.637 --> 19:18.774
You pick a team, you root for that team,
and you hope that team wins.

19:18.775 --> 19:21.075
You just made March
boring again.

19:22.844 --> 19:26.046
Listen, I'm sorry
I yelled at you earlier.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.818
Ah, I messed up; I deserved it.

19:29.819 --> 19:31.286
No, this is not on you.

19:31.287 --> 19:32.988
I gave you half the information

19:32.989 --> 19:34.990
and then laid into you
when you screwed up.

19:34.991 --> 19:37.759
Just like my old man
used to do to me.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.761
At least your old man
was around.

19:39.762 --> 19:44.966
So, uh... you think I could
place another bet sometime?

19:44.967 --> 19:46.267
Depends.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.969
I want double or nothing
on this Carolina game.

19:50.805 --> 19:53.842
Double or nothing?

19:53.843 --> 19:55.976
That's a lot of dough.

19:57.579 --> 19:58.947
It's only money.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.215
It's a close game.

20:00.216 --> 20:02.317
You-you seem awful calm
about it.

20:02.318 --> 20:03.751
Eh, what are you gonna do?

20:03.752 --> 20:06.087
Sometimes you just got to sit
back and leave it to the fates.

20:06.088 --> 20:07.088
Hey, hon, you want...

20:07.089 --> 20:08.456
Got out of here, you jinx!

20:08.457 --> 20:10.657
You're the kiss of death!

20:16.831 --> 20:18.298
They're looking good.
