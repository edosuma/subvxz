00:51.760 --> 00:54.069
Come on, Glorious!

01:09.080 --> 01:12.755
How does Wilfred fit into it?
Oh, he always wins.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.071
He will never beat Wilfred!
Wilfred the Great!

01:18.040 --> 01:22.397
Princess Celia! Fat Men dancing!
Thin Men dancing!

01:22.560 --> 01:26.030
That is what we call them
because that is what they do!

01:28.480 --> 01:31.153
- En garde! Voilà!

01:31.320 --> 01:33.311
Victory for me!

01:33.480 --> 01:36.119
Victory, victory, victory!
Come on, Glorious.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.956
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hi. It's Michael. Michael Walton.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.510
- Is Mr Page there?
- <i>Which one do you want?</i>

03:24.680 --> 03:26.750
Both, if possible.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.313
Come up, Michael.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.270
Come in.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.959
I am Walter, this is Oliver.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.114
And you are our cousin Michael.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.272
Yes... that's me.

03:54.440 --> 03:58.513
I believe we met once
when you were six months old.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.671
I am sure he remembers it vividly!

04:04.640 --> 04:05.834
Have some cake.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.631
Delicious cake.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.757
Is that the two of you?

04:16.920 --> 04:21.947
It is indeed. As I am sure
you've guessed, I am the baby.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.437
You do have a lot of radios.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.990
They're from our childhood.
Would you like to hear one?

04:34.280 --> 04:35.793
lt'll take a moment to warm up.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.350
What do you want to ask
both of us, Michael?

04:39.520 --> 04:43.229
Right, yes, um...
I've just got one question, really.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.039
I'm interested in history.
Family history.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.794
And you're the only ones left
from that time.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.198
Yes.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.880
- My grandmother.
Yes, Celia. Of course.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.157
I just wondered...

05:01.320 --> 05:03.595
What happened to her sister, Anne?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.273
She was an actress.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.396
She was indeed.
She made some films.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.677
She played the best friend
or the school teacher.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.671
That's her, up there.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.354
Anne was the oldest.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.351
She was adopted, of course.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.353
As frequently happens,
they were desperate for children.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.590
But they didn't think
they could have any,

05:22.760 --> 05:25.035
and so they adopted one.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.192
And then, lo and behold,
along came the babies anyway.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.148
They were all very close.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.834
You didn't think it would work.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.798
Let's see if we can find
something more appropriate.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.239
What happened to her?

05:45.680 --> 05:47.113
Tell me.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.751
It's not always a good place
to go, Michael - the past.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.196
- This is a little bit better.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.079
Let's see if we can get
a clearer signal.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.550
<i>It had been a fantastic</i>
<i>summer, that summer of '39.</i>

06:14.720 --> 06:17.553
<i>The most glorious summer</i>
<i>most people could remember</i>

06:17.720 --> 06:19.870
<i>for a very long time.</i>

06:20.040 --> 06:24.909
<i>The year before, it had seemed</i>
<i>war with Germany had been averted,</i>

06:25.080 --> 06:28.550
<i>the policy of appeasing Hitler,</i>
<i>of reasoning with him,</i>

06:28.720 --> 06:30.790
<i>really had worked.</i>

06:30.960 --> 06:34.475
<i>And even now it seemed</i>
<i>it might still work.</i>

06:35.760 --> 06:39.230
<i>Your grandmother,</i>
<i>and Anne and Ralph,</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:42.710
<i>had grown up</i>
<i>in a most beautiful house</i>

06:42.880 --> 06:44.791
<i>with an even more beautiful garden.</i>

06:46.080 --> 06:48.514
<i>It was a very exciting time.</i>

06:48.680 --> 06:51.319
<i>Ralph was doing well</i>
<i>at the Foreign Office,</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:54.995
<i>Anne had a part she was</i>
<i>pleased about in a new movie.</i>

06:56.360 --> 06:59.830
<i>It was your</i>
<i>great-grandfather's birthday,</i>

07:00.000 --> 07:03.788
<i>and they had prepared</i>
<i>the most wonderful table for him,</i>

07:03.960 --> 07:05.996
<i>or rather Anne had,</i>

07:06.160 --> 07:08.435
<i>because she was in charge</i>
<i>of most things.</i>

07:15.360 --> 07:19.558
The Fat Men on the march. It's one
of your very best tables, Anne.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.750
I like your friend.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.751
The other one's a little dotty.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.309
Maybe a little,

07:28.480 --> 07:30.869
but he can be great fun.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.474
Anne, he is beautiful.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.275
Why all the knights?
What are they up to?

07:39.440 --> 07:43.513
Ah. It's... it's something
we started as children.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.875
Perhaps I'll get to take
one of these home.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.315
They're absolutely everywhere!

07:48.480 --> 07:50.471
Do you want to see?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.714
It's all her fault!

07:56.880 --> 07:58.916
Anne started it,
and then we all did them.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.911
We call them
"Fat Men dancing".

08:01.080 --> 08:03.719
This reminds me of someone
I used to work with.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.314
And now there's
no escaping them!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.193
Oh, that's George.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.635
His sister, Sonia,
disappeared a few days ago,

08:11.800 --> 08:13.950
so he's a little upset.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.839
Were you allowed to put them
everywhere you wanted?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.468
Almost everywhere!
We were not allowed in those.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.232
This is the shell line.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.118
We were not allowed to cross it.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.558
Those buildings were stuffed with
Papa's papers he used for his books.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.553
- I bet you did cross it, though.
- No, never needed to.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.109
We never have.
Even now, none of us.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.191
There were so many
other places to play.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.236
Do you want to see
where it all started?

08:38.400 --> 08:42.951
We have time to go, don't we, Anne?
Please? Say yes.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.111
Yes. If we're quick.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.839
Oh!

08:52.400 --> 08:54.197
Mr Speaker!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.958
Marvellous place to come
to rehearse one's speeches!

08:59.120 --> 09:02.032
Point of order, Mr Speaker!

09:03.280 --> 09:06.192
The Honourable Member
must retract that immediately!

09:07.840 --> 09:11.833
Both the first part
and the third part.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.838
So this is where it all comes from,
the stories we made up

09:17.000 --> 09:18.831
about chubby men
doing heroic things!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.514
They were all deeply flawed,
our knights,

09:21.680 --> 09:23.159
overweight and lazy.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.596
- We liked them like that.
- But they could be very brave

09:26.760 --> 09:28.910
when we wanted them to be.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.152
They slaughtered anyone
who dared attack them!

09:33.640 --> 09:36.598
Your father made terrific speeches
in the House of Commons.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.955
It's a pity he speaks
so less often now.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.032
Well, his health
has always been delicate.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.839
That's why he takes
more of a back seat now.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.592
I've heard a lot about your papa.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.433
Heard he's the most charming man
in England.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.636
Which makes me rather nervous.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.791
What if he doesn't like me?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.431
Hello.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.599
Happy birthday.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.796
Oh, my, my, my!

10:13.960 --> 10:16.474
What a glorious homecoming!

10:16.640 --> 10:19.916
Anne, you've surpassed yourself,
absolutely surpassed yourself!

10:20.080 --> 10:21.069
You all have.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.437
Henry, you've met, of course.
This is Joseph Balcombe,

10:24.600 --> 10:27.797
a colleague of Henry's.
Joseph, these are my children.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.679
It is a delight to find
it is your father's birthday.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.637
- Happy birthday, Papa.
- Thank you.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.189
- Your mother is still getting ready?
- Naturally.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.717
- She did all the flowers, of course.
- Hector! Good to see you!

10:39.880 --> 10:41.791
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.757
- And you must be Lawrence.
- I am.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.229
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
And happy birthday.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.437
Thank you. You certainly live up
to Anne's description of you.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.999
Papa!

10:51.160 --> 10:53.435
There is no easy reply to that.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.149
Did he say he is one of the cleverest
people in the Foreign Office

10:57.320 --> 10:59.834
and I had better watch out?
Because that is the truth.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.359
Why are you here
in these parts, Mr Balcombe?

11:11.240 --> 11:16.189
A little fishing. I was determined
to get in some fishing somehow.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.113
- How very sensible.
- And coming here

11:19.280 --> 11:22.113
to such an ancient place, it's...

11:22.280 --> 11:25.829
Well, it's quite possible to think
that all is right with the world.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.115
But it isn't, is it?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.840
We're not sleepwalking
towards disaster.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.639
We're going up to it,
welcoming it with open arms.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.360
I've certainly been known
to do that in my time.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.829
Precisely in what way
are we doing that?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.958
I will tell you precisely.
We're not content with letting Hitler

11:41.120 --> 11:42.997
march into Czechoslovakia
and Austria.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.119
Now we're saying, "That's all right,
old chap. Take some more countries."

11:47.280 --> 11:48.998
- Are we saying that?
- Yes, we are.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.311
Hitler wants to take over Europe,
and we are letting him do it

11:52.480 --> 11:55.631
so long as he doesn't bother us.
That can't be allowed.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.677
Forgive a statement that's obvious,

11:57.840 --> 11:59.159
or what I think is obvious,

11:59.320 --> 12:01.197
but evil has to be stood up to.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.920
But one has to be
in a position to do that.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.117
- One has to have the means.
- We've got the bloody means!

12:07.280 --> 12:09.111
Even if we have let Germany re-arm,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.396
we mustn't exaggerate
how strong she is!

12:11.560 --> 12:14.518
Under this current government of
Mr Chamberlain, my own leader,

12:14.680 --> 12:17.035
we are behaving as if
we have to avoid war

12:17.200 --> 12:18.599
at absolutely all costs.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.877
So every day we do something
that makes the situation worse.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.792
Do you really think that is true?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.712
What did you have in mind?

12:25.880 --> 12:28.838
To give you one example,
I've heard rumours.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.355
I've heard the most
extraordinary rumours

12:31.520 --> 12:33.670
that we are trying
to interest the Nazis

12:33.840 --> 12:36.991
in accepting a gigantic secret loan,

12:37.160 --> 12:40.391
which we will negotiate for them
on the international markets,

12:40.560 --> 12:43.757
so they might turn their armament
industry back to peaceful means.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.354
We are actually planning
to give them money!

12:46.520 --> 12:48.670
That does sound truly bizarre,
Hector.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.593
Alexander fought in the war,
got wounded,

12:51.760 --> 12:53.432
so I don't criticise him,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.830
but not enough other people
are speaking out.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.117
It's up to young MPs like me
to get rid of our present leadership,

12:59.280 --> 13:01.157
which is leading us
towards our doom.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.880
That is... quite a claim, Mr Haldane.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.918
Yes, and I'm aware
it isn't a popular thing to say

13:07.080 --> 13:10.152
the present leadership will stand
no opposition or criticism.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.959
The present leadership
view Mr Churchill as dangerous

13:13.120 --> 13:14.838
because he would stand up to Hitler.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.356
He doesn't care
about giving offence to the Nazis.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.637
So I feel I have to do
everything in my power

13:21.800 --> 13:25.315
to make sure Mr Churchill
is not ignored.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.914
Come on Thursday.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.679
The house will be empty
in the afternoon.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.071
- Can you come?
- Yes.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.354
I'll still be at Cranmore, I can come.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.479
Excuse me.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.632
A very pleasant evening.
Thank you.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.630
Who is that man?

14:09.800 --> 14:11.791
A strange, strange man.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.593
Thank you
for such a wonderful birthday.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.588
- It wasn't spoilt by Hector?
- No.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.275
I'm used to his fiery outbursts.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.908
And there is the possibility
he could be right.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.834
Will you read to me, darling?
I love it when you read to me.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.235
What would you like me to read?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.914
It doesn't matter.
Some Keats, anything.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.436
"My heart aches,

15:05.600 --> 15:09.275
"and a drowsy numbness
pains my sense,

15:09.440 --> 15:13.035
"as though of hemlock I had drunk,

15:13.200 --> 15:16.237
"or emptied some dull opiate..."

15:49.760 --> 15:53.594
Oh, Sonia.
How did you get in there?

16:09.200 --> 16:13.193
You've made me
break the rules, Sonia.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.999
What've you been doing
in here anyway?

16:16.160 --> 16:19.232
Reading Papa's manuscript
about Napoleon?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.916
What are these doing here?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.435
Been having a good listen,
have you?

16:42.080 --> 16:43.115
Hello?

16:58.080 --> 16:59.308
Mama?

16:59.480 --> 17:02.074
- I found Sonia.
- That's splendid.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.192
So much needs doing.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.830
- You didn't see anyone pass by here?
- No, dear.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.191
It must have been
one of the servants.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.911
Look who I've found.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.832
Ah!

17:20.680 --> 17:22.796
She got into one of the sheds.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.428
She didn't realise
it was forbidden territory.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.157
I thought you knew that.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.675
Grumpy old girl. So good you're back.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.990
Look what I found there too.
Foxtrots.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.832
One of your favourites, Papa!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.991
She's been dancing
in there too.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.913
How odd. I don't think
I put gramophone records in there.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.833
- I wonder how that happened.
- Let's see if it still plays.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.635
<i>(MAN 1 ON RECORD)</i>
<i>Did you receive the letter?</i>

17:50.800 --> 17:53.268
<i>(MAN 2) Yes, I believe</i>
<i>I did receive that.</i>

17:53.440 --> 17:56.591
<i>I thought we dealt with that subject</i>
<i>you raised with me before</i>

17:56.760 --> 17:59.115
<i>and were allowing</i>
<i>time for reflection.</i>

17:59.280 --> 18:02.670
<i>There are various factors which have</i>
<i>to be taken into consideration...</i>

18:02.840 --> 18:06.116
That's no foxtrot.
I'd like to see Papa dancing to that!

18:06.280 --> 18:08.475
- That's very strange.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.312
I think this must be Joseph's doing.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.349
Mr Balcombe asked if he could store
some government overflow with us.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.476
They're drowning in paper,
apparently.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.756
The government needs
to store things here?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.433
It seemed a harmless thing to do.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.832
The reason he gave is interesting,
and quite funny, and rather rude.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.194
He said there were so few places

18:27.360 --> 18:29.316
where one can trust
the servants won't go any more,

18:29.480 --> 18:31.710
but knowing our servants,
that wasn't a worry here.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.711
He said that?

18:33.880 --> 18:37.555
They hardly manage to clean the
house, let alone the outbuildings!

18:37.720 --> 18:39.233
People didn't count on
Sonia and Anne.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.836
Why are they storing records
that are labelled as foxtrots?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.389
Which clearly are not.

18:45.560 --> 18:49.075
That's probably their idea
of maximum security.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.071
"Let's call everything after a dance.

18:51.240 --> 18:55.358
"That'll fool everybody, nobody
will see through that!"

18:55.520 --> 18:58.353
Since Munich they've been recording
many government calls

18:58.520 --> 19:01.193
because people's note-taking
has been so inadequate.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.432
But I had no idea we had some here.
It's rather exciting.

19:06.160 --> 19:09.197
Are you sure
there's nobody here?

19:09.360 --> 19:11.874
There shouldn't be.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.031
Not even the servants.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.510
They've all gone to the fête.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.071
Do we have to have George watching?

19:25.440 --> 19:27.829
- That's Sonia.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.991
Do we have to have her watching?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.799
She likes to watch people make love.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.909
How many people has she watched?

19:39.080 --> 19:42.117
Oh, I've asked, but she's not telling.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.194
It's the way we always come,
Aunt Elizabeth.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.351
Well, there appear to be
no servants.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.596
There's no one
to take my coat.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.832
- Shall I take it?
- Oh, that's all right, my dear.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.710
Aunt Elizabeth! What a surprise!
I thought you were arriving tomorrow.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.909
There's been
a slight change of plan.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.277
Which I hope is not inconvenient.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.432
It has been quite
an extraordinarily busy fortnight.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.349
First, the ball at Blenheim Palace,
which I must admit was spectacular!

20:30.160 --> 20:32.435
People said
it put Versailles to shame.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.194
Then there was the one
at Holland House,

20:35.360 --> 20:39.672
which was an awful crush, and
full of politicians and film stars.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.355
- No offence, my dear.
- It sounds exhausting.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.315
Actually, it was rather invigorating.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.550
You're looking very well, my dear.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.074
Positively glowing.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.038
It must be the country air.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.240
I'll see you in London.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.391
Promise?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.198
Of course.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.192
Even though so much is happening,

21:16.360 --> 21:18.396
nothing is going
to stop me seeing you.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.233
You don't mind me
doing the crossword here, do you?

21:51.400 --> 21:53.311
Of course not, Gilbert.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.869
We won't work today.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.270
It's always the bit players
who get delayed.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.750
Come on, Gilbert, no moaning today.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.991
I'm looking forward
to our scene next week.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.869
You're coming up for the weekend,
for the picnic, so we can rehearse?

22:09.040 --> 22:12.032
I'm honoured to be invited,
and of course I'm coming.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.760
But I don't really feel
the need to rehearse.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.595
It's the same old part for me,
the jolly old gentleman.

22:18.760 --> 22:19.954
Phone call, Miss Keyes.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.279
Hello?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.749
- <i>It's Lawrence.</i>
- Hello.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.639
- <i>Have you heard the news?</i>
- No. What?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.472
<i>Hector is dead.</i>

22:33.400 --> 22:34.992
What?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.550
What happened? That's terrible.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.711
<i>I think he killed himself.</i>

22:40.880 --> 22:42.871
Oh, my God.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.157
- <i>It's in the newspaper.</i>
- I haven't seen the newspaper.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.470
<i>He must have killed himself or...</i>

22:48.640 --> 22:50.392
Or what?

22:50.560 --> 22:53.393
<i>No, I... I can't talk on the telephone.</i>

22:54.640 --> 22:57.518
<i>I'm going to Scotland to see</i>
<i>his parents. I'll find out more.</i>

22:57.680 --> 23:00.114
- <i>As soon as I'm back...</i>
- How long are you going for?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.271
<i>Not long.</i>

23:02.440 --> 23:06.353
- <i>When I'm back, I have to see you.</i>
- I have to see you too.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.630
There you are. I thought you'd been
called and gone without me.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.398
What's the matter?

23:22.560 --> 23:23.993
Somebody I know has died.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.876
Oh, yes. Hector Haldane.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.679
Always thought
he had a marvellous name.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.308
He was one of the young
Members of Parliament

23:39.480 --> 23:41.994
speaking out against
appeasing Herr Hitler.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.914
I read one of his speeches once.
Passionate stuff.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.069
He's been calling for a change
at the top for a new prime minister.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.680
How sad.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.149
He was a man of potential.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.391
I saw him only two weeks ago.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.116
There you are, my dear!
We thought you weren't coming.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.113
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's a long journey from the studio.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.670
You'll have a thrilling evening,
meeting our new vicar.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.196
- Have you heard the news?
- We have.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.669
Poor Hector. It's terrible news.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.149
He was so full of life.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.589
So, Alexander.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.878
I'm glad to see
some things don't change.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.191
The family still matters here, clearly.

24:48.280 --> 24:51.397
You should've put a coat on, Celia.
No wonder you're cold.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.994
Of course
you're shocked, my dear.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.435
- Do you know what happened?
- No.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.477
Lawrence didn't tell me very much.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.150
He said he thought Hector
had killed himself.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.311
It's possible. He was excitable.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.753
But there was something
very touching about him.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.912
And very brave.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.520
I'm so honoured
you were able to come this evening.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.319
We're delighted to get
our own private performance.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.675
And we are all here.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.877
You've already met Kathleen,
my sister. Her boy is in the choir.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.314
Oh, yes.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.756
I hope you approve. I'm conducting
the choir myself tonight.

25:36.920 --> 25:42.153
It's an anthem that reaches back
almost as far as your family!

25:44.480 --> 25:47.631
Let us hope
he is an improvement on the last one.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.110
Are we allowed to wave at Walter?

25:56.640 --> 25:59.313
You're still looking so pale, my dear.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.668
Yes.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.632
I was just thinking about
Mr Balcombe. What does he do, Papa?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.360
He works at the Home Office
doing various things.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.556
He's in the secret service.
It's obvious.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.438
Is he?

26:14.600 --> 26:16.670
Would he have taken
an interest in Hector?

26:16.840 --> 26:20.196
Very possibly, but I don't think
he can have bumped him off.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.432
Bumped him off?
Oh, Anne, your love of the dramatic!

26:23.600 --> 26:25.636
No, I didn't mean that, of course.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.916
Mind you, he is rather spooky.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.278
He seems a little odd, I admit,
but he shares my love of fishing.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.079
It's just... Hector seemed
worried about him.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.118
You can't just get rid
of Members of Parliament like that.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.798
<i>Both the first part...</i>

26:49.040 --> 26:51.156
and the third part.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.151
<i>Forgive a statement that's obvious,</i>

26:53.320 --> 26:55.675
but evil has to be stood up to.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.758
I'll ask Mr Balcombe
to move all the stuff

27:02.920 --> 27:04.717
he's got stored in our sheds.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.519
It's not right
we have things around the house

27:07.680 --> 27:09.432
and we don't know what they are.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.478
He can do it very soon.
He's coming to the picnic.

27:13.640 --> 27:18.350
We'll feed him up and then get him
to take everything away.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.875
What a splendid estate
you have here!

27:24.040 --> 27:27.396
It's no wonder you're so proud of it,
Sir Alexander.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.790
I remember hearing you speak
at a meeting

27:29.960 --> 27:32.997
- about the wonders of nature.
- It's marvellous someone remembers.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.593
It was inspiring.

27:43.320 --> 27:46.517
I know I've seen you
in the theatre many times.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.753
One or two performances
really stood out.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.639
- Your porter, in <i>Macbeth...</i>
- Oh, yes.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.268
Drunken porter, as I remember.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.750
Especially towards
the end of the week.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.992
Come on, everybody.
We've got to walk off all this food.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.879
- Let's go to the mossy island.
- Why do we have to?

28:07.040 --> 28:08.234
I can't move!

28:09.760 --> 28:12.149
We can't take the baby
to the mossy island.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.153
It's all right. I'll stay here
and look after it.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.790
Don't worry, Aunt Elizabeth,
I'll stay. Learn my lines.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.679
We'll both sit
and look after him together.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.476
I think I might stretch my legs
after all, if you don't mind.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.674
I'll lose all use of them

28:44.840 --> 28:47.274
if I don't get out
of this ridiculous chair at once.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.468
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>there's nobody here?</i>

29:20.640 --> 29:21.914
<i>There shouldn't be.</i>

29:47.720 --> 29:48.914
Oliver?

29:54.280 --> 29:56.635
They must have come back for him.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.519
Oliver?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.109
Oliver!

30:09.680 --> 30:11.636
Hello!

30:14.560 --> 30:15.834
Papa!

30:16.600 --> 30:18.716
Have you got Oliver with you?!

30:19.960 --> 30:21.154
Papa?

30:25.160 --> 30:26.718
Walter! Didn't you hear me?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.438
Have they got Oliver with them?

30:28.600 --> 30:31.353
- No. YOU'VE got Oliver.
- No, he's gone.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.479
Somebody must've come back
for him when I wasn't looking.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.234
He's not on the mossy island.
I've just been there.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.912
Hello? Who's that?

30:45.840 --> 30:49.719
Walter, go back and get them all,
right now. Go on.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.838
Go and get them all right now.
Quick!

31:10.240 --> 31:11.673
Oliver!

31:26.040 --> 31:27.996
Oliver!

31:31.600 --> 31:33.477
Who's got Oliver?!

32:05.360 --> 32:08.670
Walter! What are you doing here?
I told you to go and find them all!

32:08.840 --> 32:12.037
I've done that. They're all
coming back. I came to help.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.556
- Are you playing a game, Walter?
- No, I'm not playing a game.

32:15.720 --> 32:18.553
Did you move Oliver?
Were you told to play a game?

32:18.720 --> 32:21.393
I told you, I am not playing a game.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.876
Tell me where Oliver is.
Tell me where he is!

32:26.040 --> 32:27.871
Anne!

32:30.080 --> 32:32.469
There she is.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.237
- Have you got Oliver?
- We haven't.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.719
He's gone!

32:36.880 --> 32:39.792
I was just there, and
I turned round and he was gone,

32:39.960 --> 32:42.918
- and the pushchair vanished!
- Calm down.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.674
- He can't have gone far.
- They took the pushchair!

32:45.840 --> 32:48.115
- Oh, my God!
- I found his shoe.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.919
If we all fan out,
we can cover a lot of ground.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.752
I'm so sorry!

32:52.920 --> 32:56.515
- Oliver!
- Oliver!

32:57.520 --> 32:59.988
I think we should take this path.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.628
But I've looked here. Of course I have.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.631
We're following the path!

33:04.800 --> 33:07.439
- I've been down this path.
- Everything's all right.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.716
Everything's going to be all right.

33:09.880 --> 33:14.192
He's not anywhere here.
I've looked here, of course I have!

33:17.640 --> 33:19.232
Oliver!

33:29.000 --> 33:31.639
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God!

33:31.800 --> 33:34.030
We've found him, everybody!

33:35.920 --> 33:39.913
Here he is, safe and sound.
The panic's over.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.272
I'm sorry!

33:45.880 --> 33:48.030
How on earth
did he get there?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.476
I don't know. I really don't know. I...

33:51.640 --> 33:55.474
I must have fallen asleep
for a few seconds and... he was gone.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.633
- Somebody moved him.
- Somebody moved him?

33:59.800 --> 34:02.951
Maybe you were concentrating
so much on your lines, darling,

34:03.120 --> 34:06.715
- you walked with him, not realising.
- I didn't walk with him!

34:06.880 --> 34:10.315
- I didn't move him!
- Are you sure about that?

34:10.480 --> 34:13.152
- You said you fell asleep.
- I didn't walk with him.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.436
I didn't move him,
I'm absolutely certain.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.592
I did not move him!

34:23.960 --> 34:27.350
He did have a hell of a lot
packed away in our sheds.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.112
I hear they've got
the Duke of Wellington

34:29.280 --> 34:32.158
to take several tons
of confidential material

34:32.320 --> 34:33.594
and put it in his basement!

34:33.760 --> 34:36.320
They're so worried
about Communist infiltration,

34:36.480 --> 34:38.710
they'd rather put it
in a duke's wine cellar.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.474
What excuse did you give, Papa,
to make him take it all away?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.755
I said in winter the sheds all leak.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.150
I didn't move the baby.
You ought to believe me.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.038
- I do.
- Then who moved him?

34:49.199 --> 34:51.589
- It was Walter.
- Walter?

34:51.760 --> 34:54.592
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe it WAS the boy. Who knows?

34:54.760 --> 34:57.034
Perhaps he'd had wine
when we weren't looking.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.872
Or somebody
asked him to move him.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.235
Why would they do that, darling?

35:01.400 --> 35:04.073
To make me seem unreliable,
a bit dotty.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.550
He knows I'm friends
with Lawrence and with Hector.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.713
I think we should let Mr Balcombe
disappear with all his boxes

35:11.880 --> 35:14.075
and just not invite him again - ever.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.595
We want to be sure we get rid of him,

35:16.760 --> 35:18.432
which I'm sure we can do.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.160
We've lost a terrific chance
to do a lot of snooping.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.070
- So, I think that is everything.
- Including all the foxtrots?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.359
I believe so, yes.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.392
And there's nothing left behind
in here, is there?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.516
- In the house?
- I don't think so, Joseph.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.113
No.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.998
No. I don't know of anything.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.672
- Come in.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.519
I just wanted to see how you are.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.638
I'm absolutely fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.711
Of course not.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.189
Anyway, the spooky man
has gone at last.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.113
Papa says we're returning
to London in the morning.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.599
- Really?
- Yes.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.955
Because Parliament
may be about to be recalled.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.712
It's a bit of a crisis, apparently.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.678
But I think it's terrific we're going.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.991
Nowadays I can't stand it
down here after a couple of weeks.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.513
No disrespect to Sonia.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.635
You'll forgive me, won't you?

36:31.800 --> 36:33.631
I really miss Horatio.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.433
Oh, Sir Alexander!
I wasn't expecting you!

36:41.600 --> 36:43.431
The house is not aired!

36:43.600 --> 36:46.319
We had no idea you were
coming back to London today.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.278
And Mrs Hardiman is not back
till the end of the week.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.749
No need
to alarm yourself, Betty.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.433
We live in unpredictable times.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.397
We can manage without Mrs Hardiman.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.949
And there is this awful racket
from next door, sir.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.758
They're getting ready for a party.

36:59.920 --> 37:02.992
- There's been banging all day long.
- I'm sure it will all be fine.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.674
As long as they don't
throw anything into our garden.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.114
And remember to invite us.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.990
It doesn't seem to be
our home at all, does it?

37:20.160 --> 37:22.196
The house all wrapped up like this.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.591
- No.
- The FO will be abuzz.

37:29.960 --> 37:34.272
Glorious... I know
it's a very sensitive subject,

37:34.440 --> 37:37.557
but with my new job,
I have access to all sorts of things,

37:37.720 --> 37:41.793
and I know who to ask
to find out even more.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.076
So... only if you wish it, of course,

37:44.240 --> 37:47.630
but I could find out
who your real parents were.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.949
- You could?
- So what do you think?

37:57.720 --> 37:59.597
I don't know if I want to know.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.870
For some reason,
it's never really worried me

38:03.040 --> 38:04.234
who my real parents are.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.911
I don't think about it much any more.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.958
It's a big decision.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.669
Oh, Betty. There used to be another
gramophone, an old wind-up one.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.319
Whatever happened to that?

38:29.480 --> 38:32.950
Oh, that old thing?
I put it away in the lumber room.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.758
<i>We're clear which</i>
<i>sectors we're concentrating on</i>

38:46.920 --> 38:49.036
<i>and which remain</i>
<i>still to be enquired into?</i>

38:49.200 --> 38:52.670
<i>I think we're all agreed</i>
<i>which areas are the highest...</i>

38:52.840 --> 38:55.718
<i>... reports that we've had back</i>
<i>so far are to be studied</i>

38:55.880 --> 38:57.199
<i>at the next meeting.</i>

38:57.360 --> 38:59.635
<i>The individual reports</i>
<i>we'll be looking into</i>

38:59.800 --> 39:04.316
<i>are number 10, 15 and 22.</i>
<i>37 is still being...</i>

39:10.240 --> 39:13.312
<i>... nothing more</i>
<i>to say! You keep ringing me!</i>

39:13.480 --> 39:15.948
<i>And you've got to stop!</i>
<i>You've got to stop this!</i>

39:16.120 --> 39:19.476
<i>(MAN 1) We're just reminding you,</i>
<i>Mr Haldane, of the information...</i>

39:19.640 --> 39:22.200
<i>That information is private!</i>
<i>It's PRIVATE!</i>

39:22.360 --> 39:24.715
<i>People do all sorts of things</i>
<i>in their lives!</i>

39:24.880 --> 39:27.474
<i>And if I have, I have!</i>

39:27.640 --> 39:30.074
<i>I just want you to stop calling me</i>
<i>and my parents...</i>

39:30.240 --> 39:34.074
<i>(MAN 1) We wanted you to realise</i>
<i>we meant what we said,</i>

39:34.240 --> 39:36.356
<i>and it is best for you to listen to us.</i>

39:36.520 --> 39:38.954
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>this is happening to me!</i>

39:39.120 --> 39:41.714
<i>I want you to stop calling</i>
<i>my parents! Do you hear me?</i>

39:41.880 --> 39:43.279
<i>DOYOU HEAR ME?</i>

39:43.440 --> 39:45.476
<i>You have to agree to that! My father is ill!</i>

39:45.640 --> 39:47.676
<i>He cannot stand it! You have no right...</i>

39:49.520 --> 39:52.478
I'm so sorry, miss. I had no idea
you were in here.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.269
I didn't realise you might want
to listen to something in here!

39:56.440 --> 39:58.078
Don't worry, Betty. It's my fault.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.197
I had to listen to something
for the film I'm playing a part in.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.193
- Going out, Papa?
- Hello, darling.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.954
Yes. To the club,

40:16.120 --> 40:18.270
where the atmosphere
will be feverish.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.750
I need to talk to you,
when you have a moment.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.753
Not now, darling.
There have been developments.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.150
The world goes on moving
faster and faster

40:27.320 --> 40:29.709
and I am not at all sure
we can stop that.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.758
- More gramophone records, I see.
- Yes.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.071
I thought you gave everything back
to Mr Balcombe.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.588
What is that?

40:39.760 --> 40:42.399
- This is a real foxtrot, for once.
- Is it?

40:44.800 --> 40:46.438
Good.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.910
We don't want to give Mr Balcombe
an excuse to return.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.150
No, that would not be good.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.430
We'll talk... when this crisis is over.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.637
I love them having a party next door
as the balloon's going up.

41:06.800 --> 41:10.349
Is the balloon going up? Now?

41:10.520 --> 41:12.511
I should have listened to the wireless.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.591
It may or may not be going up.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.433
Should we be held
to our promise to Poland?

41:17.600 --> 41:20.751
Do we really want to go to war for them?

41:20.920 --> 41:22.911
Can this be happening all over again?

41:23.080 --> 41:25.594
That's what's going on.

41:25.760 --> 41:29.389
They're all travelling back from
their country estates as we speak.

41:29.560 --> 41:33.075
It's as bad as that.
There's nothing you can do, Glorious.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.038
You go on making your movie.
Cheer people up.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.474
I can't just do that,
I have to do something more.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.437
No, this is good advice.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.388
It's an absolutely splendid thing
to cheer people up.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.949
They're not going to do our scene
today. They've told us to go.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.793
Not today? I don't believe it!

41:55.960 --> 41:57.359
We will never be needed.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.795
The weather's not right, apparently.

41:59.960 --> 42:04.238
I've managed to get my father's
chauffeur to pick us up.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.436
Will you come home with me, Gilbert?

42:06.600 --> 42:09.398
Who could resist such an invitation?

42:09.560 --> 42:12.279
I want to play you something, in private.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.192
It's this gramophone record.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.715
You're much better informed
about everything.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.155
Flattery as well! Today is looking up.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.312
We just have to pick up
my brother and sister at a ball.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.592
It's not too far.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.275
This is the way to travel
for a poor boy like me.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.714
Always dreamt
I'd have a car like this as an actor.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.555
Hasn't happened yet.
Never got above the title.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.153
Not even once.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.951
Time for some riotous living,

42:45.120 --> 42:48.078
for no one has any idea
what's going to happen tomorrow.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.715
So, what's the tune
you want to play me?

42:54.880 --> 42:57.758
It's not a tune, it's a conversation.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.598
It's a recording of a meeting.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.435
I found it among things Mr Balcombe
was storing with us in Norfolk.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.639
There was another record as well,
of Hector screaming, really upset.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.155
The man who killed himself?
Where is it?

43:20.320 --> 43:22.117
It's broken. It got smashed.

43:22.280 --> 43:25.272
Since the baby and the pushchair,
you don't trust what I say.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.839
When did I say that?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.356
I know it's my fault I haven't read
more about the political situation,

43:30.520 --> 43:31.999
being too bound up with my work.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.755
It's conceivable the secret service
are listening in and recording

43:35.920 --> 43:39.071
the conversations
of those opposed to the government.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.993
- That is possible?
- Extremely possible.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.754
Yes, and that spying
and these recordings

43:44.920 --> 43:47.718
could be used to put pressure
on people, couldn't they?

43:47.880 --> 43:50.235
To blackmail them into silence,
if necessary.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.789
- That too is possible, if risky.
- Yes,

43:52.960 --> 43:55.349
because they wouldn't wish that
to become public.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.080
No! lmagine what the supporters
of Winston Churchill

43:58.240 --> 44:00.071
would do with information like that.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.356
It would bring down
the present leadership,

44:02.520 --> 44:04.476
Churchill would become Prime Minister,

44:04.640 --> 44:07.518
that would lead to a bolder approach
to Germany!

44:07.680 --> 44:09.910
Blackmail. Well, I never.

44:10.080 --> 44:14.119
Although it's... possible, of course,
that elements in the secret service

44:14.280 --> 44:17.556
are taking things further
than the Prime Minister intended.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.278
Is that what's on that recording?

44:19.440 --> 44:22.910
Oh, no, no.
It's merely a boring meeting.

44:23.080 --> 44:26.152
But I thought perhaps you would know
who the people were.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.515
Why would they record a boring meeting?

44:28.680 --> 44:30.875
Perhaps because somebody
couldn't be there

44:31.040 --> 44:32.758
and they didn't want notes taken?

44:32.920 --> 44:35.150
That's just
a slightly drunken actor's guess.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.357
But now, if war comes,
none of this matters.

44:38.520 --> 44:41.592
On the contrary, my dear,
it will matter all the more.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.000
Some of these people don't want a war.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.879
They don't want Winston Churchill
as Prime Minister.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.190
They want this country to be left alone.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.749
They don't care
what's happening in Europe

44:52.920 --> 44:55.309
as long as this lovely place
is not disturbed.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.994
They'll want to make peace
as soon as they can,

44:58.160 --> 45:00.116
maybe at any price,

45:00.280 --> 45:02.999
and give Hitler
all sorts of things in return.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.433
But we shouldn't worry.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.319
We will be looking down at everybody
from a cinema screen

45:09.480 --> 45:12.358
dressed in ludicrous Victorian dress.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.153
That is, if we ever get our call.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.389
Hello! Hello, down there!

46:00.600 --> 46:01.635
There you are!

46:02.960 --> 46:05.918
You're so early. You're much too early.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.640
It is nearly 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, Celia.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.189
You missed something gorgeous.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.318
There were exotic birds
and fountains of gold water.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.152
And Aunt Elizabeth is still here.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.834
Like me, she hasn't slept all night.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.954
So you've been up all night,
Aunt Elizabeth?

46:25.120 --> 46:28.669
Yes. Still to go to bed!

46:28.840 --> 46:30.478
I stayed up with the young people.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.279
Haven't done that for years.
What amazing times we live in!

46:34.280 --> 46:37.431
I was meant to go hours ago,
but I never did.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.636
- Oh, Mr Williams!

46:39.800 --> 46:41.631
Just the person I want to see.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.712
- I am?
- You must come over here, come on,

46:44.880 --> 46:47.440
and hear what I've got to tell you.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.993
I've been tidying up my house,
or rather the servants have,

46:53.160 --> 46:54.673
in case we have to run like mice,

46:54.840 --> 46:57.308
and you'll never guess
what they have unearthed.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.596
My whole collection
of theatre programmes,

46:59.760 --> 47:02.069
- many of them featuring you.
No!

47:02.240 --> 47:07.951
Mm. You in <i>Richard II</i>
and in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii...</i>

47:08.120 --> 47:09.951
Marvellous! I'd love to see them.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.551
You'll have to come with me now,

47:13.720 --> 47:16.029
because if this irritating war
breaks out,

47:16.200 --> 47:17.872
the whole thing will get scattered.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.032
You don't mind coming to my little
house by St Paul's after tea?

47:21.200 --> 47:23.350
- Not at all. That'd be thrilling.
- Gilbert.

47:23.520 --> 47:27.115
My career in theatre programmes.
I never kept anything.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.998
- I was superstitious.
- Gilbert.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.798
- Milk?
- Thank you. Hmm?

47:30.960 --> 47:32.188
We had an appointment.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.039
Yes... Give me what you want me
to listen to, dear,

47:39.200 --> 47:42.715
the record, and I'll listen to it
when I get home, I promise.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.474
I'd love to have seen
<i>The Last Days of Pompeii.</i>

47:48.240 --> 47:52.119
What? I didn't say anything.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.959
Where is he?

48:04.080 --> 48:06.469
Where the hell is Mr Williams?

48:13.840 --> 48:15.558
I'm late.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.153
I'm late.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.595
Well, come on! Come on, Gilbert!

48:25.080 --> 48:27.196
- Where've you been?
- Anne...

48:30.240 --> 48:32.993
We have to go
straightaway. No rehearsal.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.357
It's clouding over, we're losing
the light. We need to film now.

48:36.520 --> 48:41.799
Mark it, please <i>House of Cheyney,</i>
scene 105, take 1.

48:44.760 --> 48:45.749
Action!

48:45.920 --> 48:50.994
Uncle, I know you said not to take
the job at the big house.

48:51.160 --> 48:55.676
But the master has been so kind
to me, and it is a fine opportunity.

48:55.840 --> 48:59.469
There will be
other opportunities.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.517
I know you have your eye on him.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.797
But he is engaged to another

49:04.960 --> 49:10.432
and, however much you hope,
that situation will not change.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.273
You should listen to me, Jenny.

49:13.440 --> 49:17.194
Cut! Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.592
Apparently...

49:20.520 --> 49:23.034
I'm not quite sure how to put it.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.236
- We're now at war.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.630
We're at war with Germany.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.392
So it's happened.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.757
This news is very shocking,
but we still have a job to do.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.150
I've asked for a wireless to be sent up,

49:35.320 --> 49:37.595
and when it arrives,
we can gather round it,

49:37.760 --> 49:38.988
take an early tea break.

49:39.160 --> 49:42.152
But for now, we'll pick up
from where we were.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.515
Roll up. Action!

49:44.680 --> 49:47.672
- Do you understand, Anne?
- Yes, I think so.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.956
Which bit do you think
I don't understand?

49:50.120 --> 49:52.236
That we're at war,
or what "action" means?

49:52.400 --> 49:54.755
Come on, for God's sake! Action!

49:54.920 --> 49:57.753
Thank you.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.554
You're not waiting for me,
are you?

50:03.720 --> 50:05.597
I'm sorry. It was a very long day.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.672
- We've been watching the door.
- Mama's gone to bed early.

50:08.840 --> 50:11.229
But we thought
we should all be together.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.472
We thought today of all days
you might read to us.

50:15.440 --> 50:19.877
"Thy love is better
than high birth to me,

50:20.040 --> 50:24.477
"Richer than wealth,
prouder than garments' cost,

50:24.640 --> 50:28.838
"Of more delight
than hawks or horses be;

50:29.000 --> 50:33.630
"And having thee,
of all men's pride I boast..."

50:42.720 --> 50:44.551
Goodness, Mick!

50:44.720 --> 50:46.790
What did you do last night?

51:44.480 --> 51:47.916
Sorry, miss,
this is no place for you.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.871
Come along.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.156
- You step outside.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.190
I was just taking him his tea.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.794
I was only a couple of minutes late.

52:14.960 --> 52:19.397
He wasn't in his dressing room.
That's when I found him.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.630
They say it looks like he shot himself...

52:21.800 --> 52:24.473
They said I shouldn't ask but...
that's how it looks.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.915
- Did you see a note?
- I didn't see much.

52:27.080 --> 52:30.550
- So you didn't see a note?
- I couldn't really look at anything.

52:30.720 --> 52:34.156
I was only a tiny bit late
and... there he was.

52:35.680 --> 52:38.114
And I can't get through
to them on location.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.794
I've called and called.
His scene is very soon.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.758
It would be terrible
if they were expecting him.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.552
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Can I speak to Lawrence Newbolt?

52:49.720 --> 52:51.870
<i>Putting you through.</i>

52:54.600 --> 52:57.797
<i>I'm... sorry, I made a mistake.</i>
<i>I was misinformed.</i>

52:57.960 --> 53:00.474
<i>Mr Newbolt is not here.</i>
<i>He's gone to Paris.</i>

53:00.640 --> 53:04.349
To Paris?
But he was in Scotland.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.559
<i>He WAS in Scotland, and now</i>
<i>he's in Paris. He went this morning.</i>

53:08.720 --> 53:10.597
This morning?

53:10.760 --> 53:13.797
- When will he be back?
- <i>That is classified, of course.</i>

53:30.840 --> 53:35.152
I've just seen the dreadful news
in the paper about Mr Williams.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.550
I am so sorry.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.997
- You must be so upset.
- Yes.

53:48.120 --> 53:53.592
It was horrible.
I really was very fond of him.

53:53.760 --> 53:55.512
Does anybody know what happened?

53:55.680 --> 53:59.468
They say he shot himself.
That's what it looks like.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.352
But there wasn't a note.

54:04.520 --> 54:05.714
I waited for hours to see

54:05.880 --> 54:08.075
if they would find a note from him,
a message.

54:08.240 --> 54:10.515
- And they didn't.
- He may not have written one.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.232
It's an extraordinarily
emotional time right now,

54:16.400 --> 54:18.277
for me too.

54:21.640 --> 54:26.395
It seems it was so recent,
the last war,

54:26.560 --> 54:28.596
and having been
there myself, darling,

54:28.760 --> 54:31.513
having fought in that delightful show,

54:31.680 --> 54:35.832
I can tell you
I dream about it nearly every night.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.911
I know a lot of people are very confused.

54:42.240 --> 54:45.471
And I don't want to seem
hysterical or overdramatic...

54:45.640 --> 54:49.553
You're an actress.
Some of that is required.

54:49.720 --> 54:54.191
Yes, that's true.
- You're so bright and original,

54:54.360 --> 54:58.831
full of your stories and drawings,
always, never lost that.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.116
Your comic knights and their adventures.

55:01.280 --> 55:04.636
Yes, and so I don't want it to seem
as though I'm imagining things.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.199
I understand.

55:06.360 --> 55:10.751
And Gilbert may have killed himself.
But what if he didn't?

55:12.200 --> 55:16.034
What if something else is going on?
I mean, first Hector and then him.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.873
Why would they
concern themselves with Gilbert?

55:19.040 --> 55:22.715
It doesn't seem likely, darling,
that they're linked.

55:24.160 --> 55:27.470
- I love you.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.313
No one knows what each day
will bring at the moment,

55:30.480 --> 55:32.152
and that's very disconcerting.

55:32.320 --> 55:34.231
It applies to me as well.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.198
One thing is certain:

55:37.360 --> 55:41.114
we won't let Mr Balcombe
anywhere near us,

55:41.280 --> 55:43.589
whatever he's up to.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.194
I will keep you safe.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.309
Some things
I'm still good at, darling.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.634
I just heard the news. It's awful.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.037
It is amazing how much
has changed in a day.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.760
It's incredible,
coming through the park just now

56:04.920 --> 56:08.708
I thought I saw
this huge silver beast.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.108
A silver beast?

56:10.280 --> 56:12.748
It was, in fact, a barrage balloon
being inflated,

56:12.920 --> 56:15.639
but it was moving by itself
along the ground.

56:15.800 --> 56:20.715
And they say two million people
are being evacuated today.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.997
And lots and lots of people
are having their pets put down.

56:24.160 --> 56:26.037
- Their pets?
- Mm.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.760
Really? How awful!

56:28.920 --> 56:31.673
Because they're leaving and
there's nobody to look after them,

56:31.840 --> 56:33.796
or because they feel
it's being responsible.

56:33.960 --> 56:37.669
- I may be going to America.
- To America?

56:37.840 --> 56:40.752
- When are you going?
- Maybe very soon.

56:42.200 --> 56:45.670
Things keeps changing, but at the
moment the government suggests

56:45.840 --> 56:48.957
I should go there and try
and raise funds for the war effort.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.953
Don't worry.
Remember what I said.

56:54.360 --> 56:57.909
So can you go down to Norfolk
to look after Aunt Elizabeth?

56:58.080 --> 57:01.834
She's staying down there.
You know she hates to be alone.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.037
Your mother will join you
when she can. Won't you, darling?

57:05.200 --> 57:07.998
I just need to leave this garden
in the best state I can.

57:08.160 --> 57:11.072
It would be good if you could
go to Norfolk, darling.

57:11.240 --> 57:15.119
Yes. They just want me at the studio
for one more day, to do some sound.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.639
Miss Keyes!

57:23.040 --> 57:24.553
These were in your dressing room.

57:24.720 --> 57:26.870
I don't know if you meant
to leave them behind.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.429
I think the cigarette case is Mr Williams'...

57:29.600 --> 57:31.636
but I didn't know who else to give it to.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.910
I didn't see this
in my dressing room.

57:35.080 --> 57:36.991
It was in a cupboard right at the back.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.116
It will be a shock seeing him again, Anne.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.633
You'll find it distressing

57:40.800 --> 57:43.792
seeing Mr Williams
springing back to life, so to speak.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.032
Yes, of course it's strange...
so soon after.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.919
Yes, that's why I thought
we'd get it out of the way,

57:50.080 --> 57:53.595
get it done while we still can.
Who knows where we'll be next week?

57:54.840 --> 57:58.116
You just need to do your first line
again. There was some noise on it.

57:59.720 --> 58:03.269
Uncle, I know you said I shouldn't
take the job at the big house...

58:04.960 --> 58:08.077
You look radiant
up there, Anne, don't you think?

58:08.240 --> 58:10.117
...and it is a fine opportunity.

58:10.280 --> 58:14.159
There will be other opportunities.
I know you have...

58:14.320 --> 58:17.630
Gilbert is a bit
detached, isn't he? You can see it.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.836
He wasn't quite there.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.878
Obviously already decided
what he was going to do.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.871
Uncle, I know you think

58:27.040 --> 58:28.553
I shouldn't have taken the job...

58:28.720 --> 58:32.952
Is that?
That was a bit off, I'm afraid.

58:34.200 --> 58:37.988
Maybe you should watch
the whole scene, get in the mood.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.230
Perhaps we should have done that first.

58:47.080 --> 58:49.548
I know you have your eye on him.

58:49.720 --> 58:53.156
But he is engaged to another,
and however much you hope,

58:53.320 --> 58:56.073
that situation will not change.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.073
You should listen to it again, Anne.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.629
What... What the hell is he doing?

59:05.240 --> 59:09.233
He's saying the wrong line.
It's utterly wrong!

59:09.400 --> 59:12.119
Rewind. Rewind that.
I need to watch that back.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.877
You should listen to it again, Anne.

59:22.040 --> 59:26.192
Did you hear that? "You should
listen to it again, Anne."

59:26.360 --> 59:28.590
Rewind again, please.

59:31.600 --> 59:34.068
The real line is,
"You should listen to me, Jenny."

59:34.240 --> 59:37.391
He called you Anne instead of Jenny
and totally rewrote the line.

59:38.760 --> 59:40.557
You should listen to it again, Anne.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.599
Anne.

59:48.040 --> 59:50.554
Listen.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.397
- Ah, you're here, Miss Anne.
- I'm late, Lucy, I know.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.150
There you are. I've been waiting
to have my tea until you arrived.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.629
There's some miserable-looking
walnut cake,

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.552
but the sandwiches look promising.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.359
It's been a long journey.
I'm just going to change.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.036
<i>So we're exploring the objectives</i>

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.953
<i>that we set out and agreed upon</i>
<i>at the last meeting</i>

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.078
<i>and how we might</i>
<i>achieve them in practice.</i>

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.357
<i>And the third objective</i>
<i>remains, I think you'll agree,</i>

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.957
<i>as important as ever</i>
<i>and shouldn't be forgotten...</i>

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.471
<i>And I think it will simplify matters</i>
<i>if we combine the next two</i>

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.030
<i>under the same heading</i>
<i>and treat them together...</i>

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.191
Oh, Gilbert.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.635
<i>We should make sure the scheme</i>

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.837
<i>for applying the greatest pressure</i>
<i>on these individuals</i>

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.230
- <i>is coordinated in one place.</i>
- Balcombe.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.915
<i>The operation that was mounted</i>
<i>on the first two individuals</i>

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.470
<i>has been successful and</i>
<i>they will be troubling us no more.</i>

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.359
<i>And the third one, on Hector Haldane,</i>

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.432
<i>is, I think, about to be achieved.</i>

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.074
<i>But we do now need to give</i>
<i>this operation a name</i>

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.754
<i>to ease communication amongst us.</i>

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.957
<i>Oh, I can give you a name.</i>
<i>You want a name?</i>

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.113
<i>I've got the perfect name.</i>
<i>Let's call it "Thin Men Dancing".</i>

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.074
<i>We won't forget that in a hurry,</i>
<i>a name like that.</i>

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.118
<i>"Thin Men Dancing"?</i>
<i>It's certainly eccentric.</i>

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.192
<i>Where did that come from?</i>
<i>Anyway, why not?</i>

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:49.036
- <i>No chance of confusion there!</i>
- Ralph.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.799
No!

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.469
I've got the perfect name.
Let's call it "Thin Men Dancing".

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.272
And let us see how much dancing
they need to do!

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.520
I did knock, miss.
I didn't think you could hear me.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.234
Her Ladyship's wondering
if you're ready for tea.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.469
Beatrice Townsend rang me yesterday.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.313
She said at least there is
one silver lining to this war:

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.789
one won't have to wake up
every Friday morning

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.918
wondering if one has got
the guest list right for the weekend.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.750
But I expect the competition
between her and Emerald Cunard

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.353
will begin again very soon.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.752
They won't let a small thing
like a war stop their entertaining.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.918
Nor should they. Don't you agree?

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.548
I agree it will take
more than a war to stop them.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.711
And we mustn't let it stop us either.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.155
We must stick together down here,
my dear,

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.038
or we will go absolutely mad.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.918
We will do everything together -

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.197
listen to the wireless,
play mah-jong, go to church,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.078
do everything like twin sisters.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.113
Yes, Aunt Elizabeth.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.077
Don't look so thoughtful, my dear.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.869
But, of course, you have had
such a horrid shock.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.633
Poor Mr Williams.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.268
I hope it wasn't seeing
his whole career spread out

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.830
in the programmes from my collection
that made him so desperate.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.998
Having one's life summed up
can be very dispiriting.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.075
This little war
makes everything uncertain.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.073
<i>This is the</i> National
Programme <i>from London.</i>

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.435
<i>First news, copyright reserved.</i>

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.318
<i>The Foreign Office.</i>

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.029
Can I have extension <i>182,</i>
Lawrence Newbolt, please?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.633
<i>One moment.</i>

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.072
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>there is no reply from extension 182.</i>

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.155
You've broken the rules already,
my dear, moving the gramophone!

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.154
We're going to do
everything together, remember?

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.199
Come in here and let's listen
to what the world is getting up to

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.271
and if we should take it seriously.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.438
I can usually only enjoy
the countryside in very small doses.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.396
But it is very peaceful here.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.951
The war seems such a long way off.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.598
Although, since no bombs
are dropping anywhere,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.318
maybe London is this quiet.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.836
Do you know
what's happening with Papa?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.719
- Have you heard from him?
- No, I haven't.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.270
But then he dislikes using
the telephone almost as much as I do.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.199
We don't seem to be alone.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.598
Anyone we know?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.558
Apparently not.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.991
Just have to change my shoes, dear,
after that country walk.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.196
You've got my other shoes, haven't you?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:27.397
- Let me help you.
- Thank you, my dear.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.314
I'm so glad you're here
to keep me company, my dear.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.596
Thank you.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:48.112
And now I am going to spoil it all
and ask you just to scrape the shoes.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.429
Because if they go into the bag
like that,

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.433
they'll make these shoes
all muddy on the way back.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.157
There's a scraper round the corner.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.235
There you are, my dear.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.913
I was just telling the vicar

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.469
we must do some fundraising
for the restoration.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.108
After all, it was our family
that built this church.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.033
And what a good job they made of it.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.749
Hopefully we will still be looking
after it in another thousand years.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.832
It must be marvellous to end up
being part of such a family.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.117
"To end up"?
I haven't just joined, you know.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.953
Of course. A slip of the tongue.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.556
I meant such an old, established
family. The sense of history.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.671
It must be such a good feeling.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.631
I just have to get rid of this.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.790
Of course, it won't start.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.830
Miss Anne, that car ain't safe to drive.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.468
I have to go to London urgently.
I got a message from work.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.109
- That car ain't safe, Miss Anne.
- I've got to go.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.877
Get out of the way, Lucy!

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.434
Miss Anne, don't go! Miss Anne!

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.999
Don't go!

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:28.834
Come on. You're not
going to give out on me.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.511
What the hell does he want?

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.871
Bloody farmers!

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.949
The road ahead is closed. There
is a military exercise taking place.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.190
You'll have to find another route through.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.271
I'm going to London. How do I get there?

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.158
By another route.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.029
Yeah. Thank you for that.
Just thought you might help (!)

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.111
Where's that lorry that passed me?

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.794
You seem to have allowed
him through with no problem.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.030
Could you switch
your engine off, please?

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.550
- Can I see your identity card?
- My identity card?

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.393
- I don't have one.
- You don't have one?

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.075
From yesterday everyone
needs to carry an identity card.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.754
It's the law. There are no exceptions.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.471
- I'm afraid I'll have to detain you.
- Detain me? Why?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.189
I've been down at the film studio.
That's why I don't have one.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.669
I really need to get to London today.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.115
Without a card you're going nowhere.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.636
I am the daughter of a Member
of Parliament, Sir Alexander Keyes.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.597
If you telephone him, or allow me...

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.910
Step out of the vehicle, please.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.348
Move over to that side
of the vehicle, please.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.591
Get into the vehicle.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.554
I think you might at least
tell me where I'm going.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.239
Can I ask you to come this way now?
Come on, quickly!

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.436
We've had a lot of people like you today,

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.431
taking no notice of the regulations.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.352
So this is what happens.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.998
Hello again.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.836
I don't suppose you're going to tell me

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.672
how long I am going to be held here.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.354
I wouldn't complain if I were you, miss.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.195
We have the power now
to detain anyone indefinitely.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.874
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.878
Habeas corpus.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.716
Do you know what
habeas corpus is, miss?

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.314
Of course... Of course I do.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.997
Well, it doesn't exist any more. It's gone.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.913
We can keep you as long as
we want, wherever we want.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.277
Don't need to ask a judge any more,
don't need to ask anybody.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.318
Don't even need to tell anyone
where you've gone.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.989
Glorious! What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.752
Thank God you're here!

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.957
Papa got a call from these soldiers
saying you'd been detained!

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.236
They called the Houses of Parliament.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.198
Aunt Elizabeth telephoned to say
you rushed out coughing

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.158
like you were about to die
in the middle of choir practice.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.993
The vicar was heartbroken.
Why did you do that, Glorious?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.512
I had to... get away.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.554
I've got a bit of a confession to make.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.234
Although it won't come
as a great surprise.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.510
I'm terribly in love.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.552
I'm so in love with Lawrence,

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.156
I couldn't bear to be away from him,
shut away in the country.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.709
I had this incredible urge to see him.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.509
How wonderful, darling! That's fantastic!

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.274
That is pretty romantic, Glorious, yes.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.000
There's a party tonight
at the Foreign Office,

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.230
and we've helped arrange it.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.551
Nothing can stop the parties
happening, especially not this one.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.789
It's all the ambassadors.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.351
Lawrence is going to be there too.
Isn't that good timing?

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.669
He is?

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.115
Now you've been detained,
you've got to come.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.910
Dawson will drive your car
back to Aunt Elizabeth.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.911
I thought it was dangerous to drive.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.516
Apparently it is! That's why you
shouldn't be driving it.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.750
But Dawson's expendable, isn't he!

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.275
Lots more where you came from,
aren't there!

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.432
I get to drive the Rolls,
which is terrific. Come on, Glorious.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.592
We're hosts to tonight's party,
remember. Lots to do!

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.990
Yes, including a hot bath for you, darling.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.071
You look a real country girl like that!

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.631
You've time to have a really good
wallow before you see him.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.276
You see, everything's gone now.
It's all in storage.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:50.479
And with the whole town blacked out,
isn't it strange, darling?

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.677
Like being in another place
completely.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.432
On the moon or something!

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.511
- You look so lovely.
- Why, thank you!

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.079
I am the hostess
of this party, in a way,

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.878
so I'm just a tiny bit nervous.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.632
It's part of my new job.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.234
I am attached
to the Court of St James now!

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.197
I am going to need to go a little early.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.749
That's fine. I'll escort Anne.
We'll go together.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.869
All right. I must volunteer too.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.678
I have to do something for the war effort.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.434
Glorious, you don't have to do that.
You're an actress.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.628
- That's what you keep doing.
- Ah! But talking of volunteering...

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.428
A lot of our childhood things
down here...

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.640
I'm not sure
what's going to happen to them.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.676
Do you recognise him?
It's Bombardier.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.832
Oh, yes, of course.
Aunt Elizabeth's cat.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.639
So, darling, this is a little bit nasty,

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.756
but Aunt Elizabeth wants him put down

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.478
because she's left London.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.153
I was going to take him to the vet,

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.436
but now you're here, could you do it?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.437
I'm needed at work, you see.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.876
And I can't ask
one of the servants to do it.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.749
And I would be so upset
taking him anyway!

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.117
- Will you do it?
- If that's what has to be done.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.839
You look so good, Glorious.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.835
Here you are! So far, no disasters.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.468
They haven't started throwing things?
Give them time!

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.632
Argentina has been extremely
talkative. And America.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.997
Mr Kennedy goes on about how much
stronger Germany is than we are

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.630
and how everything is over for us
and we'd better realise it!

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.509
Darling, you must go downstairs
to the other party.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.079
That's altogether more fun.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.159
Now, I have
a series of flags here,

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.958
these little flags,

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.271
and somewhere on the map
of the world over here

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.715
- is some treasure!

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.758
So you stick your flag
wherever you think the treasure is,

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.037
and whoever is the nearest
will get a rather marvellous prize!

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.311
So come on, everybody, take a flag.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.833
Darling! There you are!

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:31.069
- It's terrific to see you.
- You're not angry with me?

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.993
- For leaving Norfolk?
- Of course not. I understand.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.799
Would you take this,
and organise the treasure hunt?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.235
Children, Ralph here
will now be in charge!

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.392
Gladly. Just don't forget to
tell me where the treasure is.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.233
It's all the children
of the ambassadors in London.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.029
They don't know whether they'll be
travelling back to their countries.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.634
- They don't know what's happening.
- A bit like us.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.712
A bit like us, yes.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.919
I should never have sent you
to the country with Aunt Elizabeth.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.868
How could I have done that?
You belong here, with all of us.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.678
- Fantastic.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.958
Now you must go
and get yourself some jelly.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.439
Some jelly? Why?

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.996
- Oh, Lawrence!
- Hello, darling.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.233
Oh, I didn't know
whether I'd ever see you again.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.630
I didn't know
whether you'd really be here.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.109
Yes, they suddenly
sent me to France. Don't cry.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.475
I am not cry... I'm not crying.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.474
It's just, for a moment,
everything seemed all right,

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.993
and I know it isn't.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.594
Now then, when we've got
all our flags pinned up,

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.955
I think we should have
a bit of a sing-song.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.429
What about a song
from each of your countries?

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.034
- Everybody like the sound of that?
Yes!

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.193
- Something terrible is going on.
- I know.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.396
- Ralph is involved.
- I know that too.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.549
You know?

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.757
Do you think he realises the
full extent of what they're doing?

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.150
- Maybe he doesn't.
- I don't know the answer.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.676
He's my brother.
I can't believe he would...

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.032
I want to believe he couldn't.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.431
What I've found out is that there's
a group of them in the secret service

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.194
and a motley collection of other people,

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.669
including some
very determined aristocrats

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.150
who are trying to bring this war
to an end before it's even started.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.278
They think we have no chance.
They want to do a deal with Hitler.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.396
I think they killed my friend Gilbert.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.597
- And they blackmailed Hector...
- They are very dangerous.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:36.437
# Be there at our waking,
your faith there, we pray

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.799
# Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,
at the break of the day #

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.713
They drove Hector to kill himself,

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.475
- I've got a recording of a meeting.
- Can you give it to me?

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.835
I don't have it here.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.390
I really have to have it.
Proof is invaluable.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.879
I must get it tomorrow.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.838
We'll meet in the morning,
Somewhere I won't be followed.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.393
I know. The vet's.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.992
The vet?

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.152
I have to take a cat to be put down.
We could meet there.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.517
- Yes, that sounds rather perfect.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.434
- It's all right. We are in love.
- Are we?

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.194
That's what I told him, and
that's what he's going to see.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.912
Not in front of the children,
Glorious! Come along.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.117
If we're to use your idea,
I'd better get the address of a vet.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.236
We can't use one that's near the house.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.676
It has to be out of the way,
in the suburbs. You understand?

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:59.957
I'll do that now, use
the great resources of the building.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.236
- No, don't go.
- I won't be a moment.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.552
# He whistled and he sang
till the green woods rang

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.794
# And he won the heart of a lady #

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.036
Now we've started the singing,

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.350
we'll have to do every single country!

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.273
Not my most brilliant idea.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.394
Come with me, Glorious.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.994
- I've got something to show you.
- Come with you where?

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.311
Follow me. It's important.
I think you should come as well.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.713
It's such a big basement.
Where are we going?

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.677
You've only seen a corner of it.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.711
Right. Come on in. This is Miss Semel.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.316
- She's working late.
- She is.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.632
Now, we have two things
for you, Anne.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.870
- Your identity card...
- That was quick.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.918
Splendid. I asked Ralph
to arrange it, and that is quick.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.436
Rather a long walk to get to it, though.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.036
That's perfect. You have your card.
You're officially you.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.754
I'd better get back to
the ambassadors, darling.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.195
I've spent too much time
with the children.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.590
They're so much more interesting (!)

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.752
- I'll come with you.
- Just a moment.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.070
- What is it?
- Why are you running away?

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.755
I'm not running away.
Why would I do that?

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.274
I don't know.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.952
I found out the other thing,
the one we talked about.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.556
It seems a rather appropriate moment
to do it, to go with the card.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.392
If you want.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.118
You mean about my parents?

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.469
Do you want to hear,
or do you want to run off?

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.240
All right. Why not?

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.590
- Good night, Miss Semel.
- Good night.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.990
I think you'll be pleased.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.798
It explains your theatrical bent -
well, I think it does.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.834
They were a Romany family.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.070
Your parents were gypsies.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.596
There are no pictures, sadly.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.832
One of them
must've been blonde, mustn't they?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.197
Maybe they had Russian blood.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.433
Thank you.
You're right. I do like the idea.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.955
I see nothing wrong
in coming from gypsies.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.277
I think I'll go back to the party now.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.632
Hello?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.199
Walter!

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.715
How are you here?
You were in church this morning!

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.791
YOU'RE here,
and YOU were in the church.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.109
Why are you here?

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.874
I didn't realise you were
the son of an ambassador.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.600
They thought I might be able
to contribute to the party.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.150
I'm sure you will be. Excuse me.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.439
Anne!

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.113
- Don't you realise?
- Don't I realise what?

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.598
They don't love you.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.393
Lawrence! Thank God it's you.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.438
What is this? I wasn't that long.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.154
- Here, have some more.
- Oh, thank you.

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.797
I have an address for you.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.191
- You can find out anything here.
- I've just discovered that.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.955
We'll meet there. Put the evidence
you have into an envelope,

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.680
and address it
to someone other than me.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.400
- Who?
- Doesn't matter. Winston Churchill.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.035
- Will they follow me there?
- No.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.395
Keep an eye out, but I don't think so.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.030
They won't follow you into the vet.
They're far too squeamish.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.474
There you are, darling.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.870
I'm off to take Bombardier
to the vet for...

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.589
- Well, you know what for.
- Yes. What things have come to.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.274
There may be lot of people there,
so I could be a while.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.716
Anne, if it's not too much to ask,

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.429
I think you should take Horatio too.
He needs to be done as well.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.828
Take our cat? Why?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.515
If I'm going to the US next week,
we'll be shutting up the house.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.389
I'll take Bombardier
because Aunt Elizabeth

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.073
has asked for that to happen.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.117
I'll find another home for Horatio.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.874
- I'm sure I can.
- No, darling, we can't do that.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.600
A lot of other people
are having to do this.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.990
They can be told
it's not necessary yet.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.391
I find myself having to tell them
that it is.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.078
Anyway, we'll get Dawson
to see to it. Don't worry yourself.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.550
Come and sit with me
and help me. I need your help.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.757
No, I'm the only one who's not
doing anything at the moment,

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.514
so I should do it,
if that's what's required.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.591
I will take the cats to be put to sleep,

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.432
then I will come back and help you.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.956
There's no school any more.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.999
These children haven't been
evacuated, so they're running wild.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.669
We'll find Lawrence, but I won't
let anything happen to you.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.356
I will find a way.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.470
Excuse me.
Have you filled out your form?

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.959
My form? What form?
No. I've only just arrived.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.111
Are you here to have your pets
put down?

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.669
I'm... meeting someone first.
I have to see him.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.308
You can't join the queue until
you've filled out a consent form.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:56.792
All those people have, so must you.
Sit out there and fill out a form.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.915
Excuse me. Has anyone
been asking for Miss Keyes?

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.593
No, miss.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:11.149
Mrs Evans?

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.080
I... I haven't quite finished filling it out.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.674
I haven't signed it
because I'm merely...

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.149
That'll do. Not everybody signs them.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.312
- As long as it's filled out.
- Has anybody asked for me?

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.950
I was meeting with someone here,
and until then...

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.554
- You may come in, Miss?
Miss Keyes.

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.039
Miss Keyes.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.111
But I... haven't joined the queue.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.273
I... I don't want to queue-jump.
I've only just done the form.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.715
Please, come in here, Miss Keyes.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.314
And bring your cats with you, of course.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.394
We're being inundated at the moment.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.916
I think because we have the space
to deal with large animals as well,

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.640
which you don't get
in the centre of town.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.712
But it's amazing how quickly
one gets used to such things.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.396
- Why have I jumped the queue?
- You seemed a little agitated to us.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.437
Agitated?

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.149
There are people crying out there.
I think I'm quite calm in comparison.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.232
We like people to be certain
about what they're doing,

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.356
and you seemed
rather upset and nervous.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.078
Believe me, I can tell.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:36.395
Well... maybe I just need
a little time, to sit and consider,

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.676
and until I meet my friend,
I really won't...

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.068
I thought so.

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.549
We have a little room,
just through there,

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.278
precisely for that purpose,

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.955
for people to make sure.
It's best you use it.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.792
Miss Keyes?

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.359
Miss Keyes?

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.070
I've changed my mind.

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.394
I'm not ready to do this. Thank you
for giving me time to reconsider.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.074
We must call you a taxi. Miss Keyes?

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.789
- You can't manage like that.
Miss Keyes!

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.554
You're not safe with me now.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.232
Go. Go on. Go.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.078
Hello.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.428
Can you do something for me?

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.998
I... need you to post this.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.551
I'll... l'll give you some money.
It needs a stamp.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.511
You'll get a stamp for it?

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.637
It's really urgent.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.510
Anne!

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.558
Anne! Where are you?

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.468
Here she is.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.877
I thought some homemade
lemonade might do the trick.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.917
I knew she was upset.

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.957
People do find it upsetting.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.755
I'll just leave it here, shall I?

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.509
Why are you here?

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.593
They found your number on the form

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.354
and phoned me
to say you were distraught,

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.593
and when I got here you'd run out
with the cats onto the common.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.912
Why did you come right out here,
darling, to this place?

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.153
I don't know.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.958
I couldn't bear to do it near home.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:02.036
- I let them go.
- You let them go?

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.992
Well, why not?

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.472
It's terrible.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.837
Look what's happened in just a few days.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.151
It's like a vision of hell, isn't it?

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.039
Animals going onto a fire
in a quiet English suburb.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.636
The world's gone mad.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.512
People are finding out
what war really means.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.434
Maybe we need something stronger
than lemonade.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.518
Here, darling.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.590
Are you aware...
of what they are doing?

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.270
They're doing something awful.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.239
Who, darling?

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.636
Are you doing it too?

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.232
Darling, you're back with us.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.473
This noise doesn't help, does it?
It's just somebody's wedding.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.718
You're in Aunt Elizabeth's house.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.633
I thought
her house was all shut up.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.598
Our home is being used
for other things.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.432
This is Mrs Knight.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.911
She will look after you.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.156
<i>Let's call it "Thin Men Dancing"!</i>

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.433
Where are you going?

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.715
<i>Don't you realise?</i>
<i>We want people to feel defeated,</i>

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.474
to feel there's no hope.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.835
That way we can do our deal
with Germany.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.758
Get out!
Get away from here! Get out!

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.840
What is happening to me?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.788
This is just so you can rest,
darling.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.191
You've been ill. You must get better.

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.395
Are they poisoning me?

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.516
Poisoning you?

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.240
Of course not, darling.

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.749
I can still remember
when I held you for the first time.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.514
When you arrived to be with us,
a bundle.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.434
You came in a taxi with a nurse.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.197
And when I held you and felt you
heavy in my arms,

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.716
it was the most beautiful present.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.917
I could never let harm come to that.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.912
So you loved me then?

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.834
"Then"? I love you!

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.552
I thought you'd never wake up.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.229
I wish I hadn't.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.192
You're not eating your food, I see.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.596
Your father
asked me to pay you a visit.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.193
My father?

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.796
- I don't believe you.
- Of course.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.829
He and I are working together.
Have been for a long time.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.833
Your father
is a very influential person.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.436
Charmingly absent-minded,
but very, very influential.

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.433
He hides his true seriousness, my dear,

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.751
except from those of us
who really know him.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.916
This recording of our meeting,

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.516
the one you tried to post,
was made for him, of course.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.077
I am sure you knew that, my dear.

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.957
All the records were for him.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.874
Why else would they
have been stored at your house?

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.190
It's a little hot, isn't it?

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:54.190
We're using your house in London
for a series of meetings.

01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.956
Your father is chairing those meetings.

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:02.032
That is why you are here.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:07.035
How simple it is,
and how very important.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.910
Are you going to kill me?

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.311
My dear,
what sort of question is that?

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.072
Even for an actress (!)

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.708
Really! The adopted daughter
of my old friend?

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:21.836
What could have given you such an idea?

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:00.759
- What happened to her?
- You think we know?

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.434
Yes, I think you do.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.593
You are a little feverish,
aren't you, darling?

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.830
Hot and cold flushes.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.433
- You've got a temperature.
- Mr Balcombe was here.

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.274
You're mistaken, darling.
Mr Balcombe was not here.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.352
I would never let him come back.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.832
We don't need to see
that spooky man ever again.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.310
So quiet, isn't it? No children, no pets.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.279
It's the most peculiar thing,
the silence out there.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.559
Except for the horrid bells.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.359
They're talking about stopping
the bells ringing

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:47.714
till the end of the war.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.839
Talk about a silver lining!
That would be simply marvellous.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:58.196
Now we need to find you
something delightful to eat.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.316
I am not eating anything

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.951
until you stop putting
something else in it.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.953
Mr Balcombe was here. I didn't dream it.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.959
He had Lawrence killed.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.236
You're feverish, darling.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.188
You let that man come back
and see me. How could you do that?

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:46.073
This war is a terrible thing, my dear.

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.759
As you know, I hate exaggeration,

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.310
but everything we believe in,

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.632
everything I believe in -
democracy, culture -

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.831
will be destroyed if we get involved
in this ruinous war.

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:10.156
I certainly don't sympathise
with the Nazi ideology.

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.754
In fact, I rather despise it.

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.710
But there is absolutely no chance
of us winning this war.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.676
We will be completely destroyed
unless we make peace.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:31.519
And we are working
to arrange that peace very hard.

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.277
Nothing must disturb that.

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:43.954
Ralph understands this.
Celia understands it in her own way.

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.715
But somehow I knew... you wouldn't.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.472
So we have to keep you here.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.477
- To do what with?
- To keep you safe.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.590
I couldn't share
certain things with you,

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.479
what I need to do for this country.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.315
Maybe there are two sorts of love.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.276
I don't want to be made to choose.

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.239
Mama?

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.356
Mama!

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.434
Mama!

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.151
You've turned into a proper hostess
when I wasn't looking.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.436
- Ralph can go.
- He's already agreed to...

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.433
Someone has to be here for Anne.
We must monitor the situation.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.831
Nobody would listen to Anne.
She's got no evidence.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.035
But it is best we do this.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.033
It's simple. We bring Mrs Knight
back. It's the best solution.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.316
Mrs Knight will get something down her

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.789
that will keep her quiet,
sedated for days.

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.474
We can have an outing
with the ambassadors' children.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.837
- You fucking bastards!

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.515
You are nothing to do with me!

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.638
You will not bring
that ghastly woman back here!

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:40.439
You think I'm going to let that bitch
look after me?

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:43.353
I will not let that fucking woman
terrorise me!

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:50.075
Why are you looking like that?
Why should you be surprised?

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.357
I'm not frightened of you!

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.317
Remember, I am the child of gypsies!

01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:57.516
It was bound to come out sooner or later,

01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.079
what I'm really like!

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.435
That's what YOU think, isn't it!
Here it is!

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.589
Darling...

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.832
Don't you fucking "darling" me,
you bastard!

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.833
You are nothing to do with me!

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.956
This is not the way, Glorious.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:18.790
Will you just leave me alone with her?

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.151
Why don't you ever do what you're told?

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.353
Why do you insist
that you always know best?

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.149
Because, in the end, what you never
realised was you knew nothing.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.231
Nothing that really mattered!

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.431
You would not listen to me, would you?

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:50.034
I told you to get on with your life.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.079
And now look at you. Look at you!

01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.679
We just have to stop
giving you water, Glorious,

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.558
and it's all over.

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:07.797
What do we do now?

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.839
We leave her.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.837
It would depend on the condition.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:55.677
I'll never let you go away again.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.797
Bombardier!

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:25.829
You can't get in,
and I can't get out.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.157
Anyone there?

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.559
Mama, did you open the door?

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:57.909
Thank you, Mama.

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.073
Go.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.117
- Walter.
- Anne! What are you doing?

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.559
I need to get away from here.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:33.598
Come this way. I'll find you a taxi.

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.830
I will.

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.674
Who are those children?

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.037
I thought all the children had been
evacuated from around here.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:47.872
They have.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:10.232
There they are.
You can join your family, Anne.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.198
We're just giving the ambassadors'
children a little outing.

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:31.796
- Come and help.
- Come and join us, Anne.

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.789
Anne! Come here, darling.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.830
Come to me.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:32.352
- And none of us saw her again.
- None of us!

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:36.559
She died, I believe, in Canada
about twenty years ago.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:39.154
We're the only ones left.

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.513
No words of condemnation for me?

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.794
No. You were...
you were very young, after all.

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:58.393
I was a baby!

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.439
And it was such a long time ago.
Nobody remembers!

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:09.674
I just did what they wanted.

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.913
I did what Mr Balcombe
and the family wanted.

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:23.115
<i>They said she needed</i>
<i>to be taught a lesson.</i>

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:34.232
<i>I was only doing what was expected.</i>

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.032
It was a very strange time back then.

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.676
I even tried to warn her.

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.831
They've all gone now.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.349
Can't trouble us.

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.636
Can't trouble Walter.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.115
Yes. I must go.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.309
There is just one thing, a little favour.

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:08.354
Another one?

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.636
My mother arranged
to meet me round here.

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.475
She would have been waiting a
little while now. It's very close by.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.838
If you could just come and say hello,
I know she'd appreciate it.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.390
Please. Will you come?

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:14.749
Dear God! It's impossible!

01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:39.319
Walter, Oliver... This is my mother.

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:44.430
And this... is Anne Keyes.

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:48.115
It's good to meet you again, gentlemen.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:51.636
It's so very good.

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.836
Anne.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.912
I had no idea, no idea at all.

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.548
No idea that I was still here?

01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.277
No, I know you didn't.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.314
You knew all along.

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.596
You knew!

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.751
We wanted to hear it from your own lips.

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.391
I just wanted to say hello again.

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.472
Since we are family.
