the first girl to mistake

(SIGHS) No idea.

no one told you about that.

20:10.126 --> 20:13.004

and I don't really want to transfer again.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.905
Good to see you, honey. How was school?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.157
Why didn't you tell me about the house?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.493
I've just been waiting for the right time.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.329
And when would that be?

20:46.454 --> 20:48.665
You know, it's just a ghost story, sweetie.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.416
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah,

20:50.541 --> 20:52.835
that everyone at my school
seems to know about.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.756
You're right. I'm sorry.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.258
I should've told you.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.842
I just, I really have had a lot on my mind.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.596
Well, it would be nice if Juliet
and I could be on your mind, too.

But it's an improvement, right?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.861
I mean, it has to be.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.072
I know it may seem that way,

21:21.197 --> 21:23.992
but remember, the last time we checked,

21:24.117 --> 21:26.452
there was no brain activity at all.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.037
But he opened his eyes.

21:28.162 --> 21:31.124
I mean, who's to say
that he won't start speaking

21:31.249 --> 21:33.209
or even sitting up or something?

21:33.334 --> 21:37.046
Joan, you know there are no documented cases

21:37.171 --> 21:40.508
of anyone with James's injuries
ever recovering.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.845
Then James will be the first.

21:43.970 --> 21:48.182
Is there any way to be sure
if there is any recovery?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.350
It's highly unlikely.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.064
But I suppose we could do another fMRI.

there used to be all this weird
occult shit going on around here,

of her brother James.

Miss Walker claims that her
brother committed the crimes,

and her story has been corroborated
by her seven-year-old sister Juliet.

Department said that forensic evidence

But Dr. Ken Milton refutes that claim,

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.834
stating that James Walker was
too weak to get out of bed,

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.337

entire family with a shotgun.
