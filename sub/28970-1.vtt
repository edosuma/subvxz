01:19.299 --> 01:20.506
Peter, hi.

01:20.508 --> 01:22.633
Hi. Did I wake you?

01:22.635 --> 01:24.093
No, no. I'm awake.

01:24.095 --> 01:27.347
I can't remember where you said
to meet now.

01:27.349 --> 01:29.559
Coastguard station.

01:30.810 --> 01:32.142
Is it near the sea?

01:32.144 --> 01:35.062
Yeah, the coastguard station
is near the sea, yeah.

01:35.064 --> 01:37.982
I think I know the place.
There's a kind of prom.

01:37.984 --> 01:41.904
And some iron men.
An ice cream man.

01:42.029 --> 01:42.987
I'm sure I'll find it.

01:42.989 --> 01:45.323
Do you know if
the ice cream man does coffee?

01:45.325 --> 01:47.533
You're there already,
aren't you?

01:47.535 --> 01:48.159
No.

01:48.161 --> 01:52.666
I can hear the seagulls.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:55.001 --> 01:57.837
Thanks for that.

02:06.221 --> 02:08.306
Is that what you're wearing?

02:08.806 --> 02:10.475
What's wrong with it?

02:11.934 --> 02:14.396
Nothing. It's very smart.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.939
It's just...

02:18.733 --> 02:20.067
What?

02:20.985 --> 02:25.240
Well, I don't know, do I?
I don't know what's appropriate.

02:25.948 --> 02:27.575
Appropriate?

02:31.954 --> 02:33.790
Very, you know...

02:33.998 --> 02:35.456
Quadrophenia.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.668
I was admiring the, er,
ice cream van too.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.422
What do you think?

02:41.173 --> 02:44.257
The cream looks really creamy.

02:44.259 --> 02:48.012
My friends and I were admiring
your paintwork.

02:51.057 --> 02:52.559
Great detail.

02:53.601 --> 02:56.103
My son paints these.

02:58.064 --> 03:00.358
Maybe this is one of his.

03:02.902 --> 03:04.987
He does the jingles too.

03:11.244 --> 03:13.205
Do you do a cappuccino?

03:30.096 --> 03:31.389
Thanks.

03:33.558 --> 03:36.058
- Been here long?
- I was admiring

03:36.060 --> 03:36.934
the ice cream van.

03:36.936 --> 03:38.436
Yeah,
it's not one of mine.

03:38.438 --> 03:42.232
- I don't do smiley ice creams.
- I appreciate that.

03:42.234 --> 03:45.027
Do you want to go in mine
or yours?

03:47.530 --> 03:49.031
Yours then.

03:49.907 --> 03:51.451
I'll drive it.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.144
What do you think of this?

04:20.730 --> 04:22.021
Is it a new jingle?

04:22.023 --> 04:23.939
I'm the wrong age bracket,
really.

04:23.941 --> 04:27.028
No, it's not a jingle.

04:27.445 --> 04:29.445
What's with the overnight bag?

04:29.447 --> 04:32.407
I thought we might need
to make a night of it.

04:32.409 --> 04:34.325
No, no, no.
I've got to get back.

04:34.327 --> 04:36.454
Sue's got stuff to do.

04:36.704 --> 04:39.707
Everything all right at home,
is it?

04:40.583 --> 04:42.084
Fine, thanks.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.922
Just a funny way
of putting things, that's all.

04:47.882 --> 04:48.464
What?

04:48.466 --> 04:50.633
"I've got to be back
because Sue's got stuff to do."

04:50.635 --> 04:53.428
Haven't you got stuff to do?
Isn't this...

04:53.430 --> 04:56.806
- stuff?
- Work. She's got work.

04:56.808 --> 04:58.974
Anyway what are you doing?
It's like being in the car

04:58.976 --> 05:01.644
- with Jack.
- It's a word game. An App.

05:01.646 --> 05:03.688
Lication.
What was that about Jack?

05:03.690 --> 05:06.274
Are you not relating
to him properly?

05:06.276 --> 05:07.525
- Am I what?
- A girl in China

05:07.527 --> 05:09.694
played a computer game
for three days and nights

05:09.696 --> 05:11.196
without a break.
Dropped dead of exhaustion.

05:11.198 --> 05:13.239
- You want to watch your Jack.
- What are you doing

05:13.241 --> 05:14.532
on your phone at a time
like this?

05:14.534 --> 05:16.367
- We should be talking.
- Since when did games

05:16.369 --> 05:18.118
stop people talking?
Talking is what we did

05:18.120 --> 05:20.996
- when we played Scrabble.
- We didn't play Scrabble.

05:20.998 --> 05:23.249
What? We were always
playing Scrabble.

05:23.251 --> 05:26.461
It wasn't Scrabble.
It was Scrabble-like.

05:26.463 --> 05:28.879
It was called Scribble.
Or Scrobble.

05:28.881 --> 05:31.674
It was a cheap rip-off
of Scrabble.

05:31.676 --> 05:33.468
The letters came
on a cardboard sheet

05:33.470 --> 05:35.970
- and we had to press them out.
- Oh, yeah.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.514
And you always insisted
on having the dictionary

05:38.516 --> 05:39.724
- on the table.
- Well, at least

05:39.726 --> 05:41.351
we played each other
and not the bloody phone.

05:41.353 --> 05:43.603
That's the amazing thing.
I'm not playing the phone.

05:43.605 --> 05:46.522
There's this guy
called Skinny Thesaurus,

05:46.524 --> 05:49.110
and he's absolutely brilliant.

05:49.569 --> 05:52.487
Fine,
talk to your digital mates then.

05:52.489 --> 05:53.948
What?

05:54.115 --> 05:54.947
I'm sure I'm going deaf.

05:54.949 --> 05:57.619
I don't hear half
of what you're saying.

06:04.542 --> 06:05.250
You all right?

06:05.252 --> 06:08.588
Yeah, I'm fine. We've got
to come back in the morning.

06:09.172 --> 06:10.713
It's only...
Not even ten-to yet.

06:10.715 --> 06:14.717
The official who does it
is on a job-share type of thing.

06:14.719 --> 06:15.801
Austerity. They finished early.

06:15.803 --> 06:18.638
Child-minding. We'll have
to make a night of it.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.515
No, no, no. We'll go home
and we'll come back

06:20.517 --> 06:22.183
in the morning.
It's already getting dark.

06:22.185 --> 06:26.979
A Roads in the dark.
Oncoming full-beam. Nightmarish.

06:26.981 --> 06:28.314
We'll get some sleep.

06:28.316 --> 06:29.649
We'd have to find somewhere
to stay.

06:29.651 --> 06:32.693
Oh, that's okay.
I've already booked somewhere.

06:32.695 --> 06:34.737
I never thought
this was a realistic itinerary.

06:34.739 --> 06:37.365
I booked somewhere
the day we heard.

06:37.367 --> 06:38.783
- Unbelievable.
- There we go again.

06:38.785 --> 06:41.076
I didn't hear that either.
It's almost as if you wanted

06:41.078 --> 06:43.078
to say things but you don't
want me to hear them.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.080
It's like a kind
of passive-aggressive thing.

06:45.082 --> 06:46.499
I said I didn't bring
a toothbrush.

06:46.501 --> 06:48.709
Oh. Well, I noticed
you didn't have a bag,

06:48.711 --> 06:51.003
so I got you one
when we stopped for petrol.

06:51.005 --> 06:52.674
Which do you want?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.092
Cyberman or...

06:56.261 --> 06:57.595
Dalek.

07:04.186 --> 07:06.727
Obviously, the circumstances
could be better,

07:06.729 --> 07:09.689
but on the other hand how often
do we get to sit around

07:09.691 --> 07:12.068
enjoying each other's company?

07:12.652 --> 07:15.655
Let's us two make the best
of it, eh?

07:30.127 --> 07:31.671
This is cosy.

07:32.129 --> 07:34.882
You can't beat a proper fire,
can you?

07:40.555 --> 07:45.891
Excuse me. We couldn't have
the music down a bit, could we?

07:45.893 --> 07:47.270
Or off.

07:51.399 --> 07:54.817
I always say the only good thing
about jazz is that it scores

07:54.819 --> 07:56.821
very highly in Scrabble.

07:59.824 --> 08:04.537
In fact, you can't play
the word "jazz" in Scrabble.

08:05.497 --> 08:07.915
There's only one "z" in the set.

08:08.416 --> 08:10.333
Oh, is that right?

08:10.335 --> 08:12.879
That's very interesting, that.

08:14.046 --> 08:16.007
There's only one "z".

08:16.549 --> 08:18.924
I haven't played Scrabble
for years. I don't suppose

08:18.926 --> 08:20.134
anybody does these days,
do they?

08:20.136 --> 08:23.388
It's all Grand Theft Auto now,
isn't it?

08:23.390 --> 08:25.350
Arthur likes Scrabble.

08:25.475 --> 08:27.101
Don't you, Arthur?

08:27.435 --> 08:31.020
Peter, you'd love a game
of Scrabble, wouldn't you?

08:31.022 --> 08:33.231
There's a set
over there, look.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.193
Under the Cluedo.

09:04.597 --> 09:06.472
You need to count all the tiles.

09:06.474 --> 09:09.016
You don't want to get half way
through a game and find

09:09.018 --> 09:11.271
you've got tiles missing.

09:12.522 --> 09:16.316
- I'm going to go to bed.
- Oh, it's only half past eight.

09:16.318 --> 09:18.234
Come on.
Have a game of Scrabble.

09:18.236 --> 09:19.902
You used to love Scrabble.

09:19.904 --> 09:21.779
I used to likeThunderCats.

09:21.781 --> 09:25.117
- I've moved on.
- What are you gonna do?

09:25.618 --> 09:27.119
Say my prayers.

09:27.787 --> 09:29.497
It's a big day tomorrow.

09:42.302 --> 09:45.805
Exterminate.

09:45.972 --> 09:48.598
Exterminate.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.686
Exterminate.

10:02.489 --> 10:06.618
You don't fancy making this
a bit more interesting, do you?

10:09.787 --> 10:11.331
How do you mean?

10:12.081 --> 10:12.663
A bet.

10:12.665 --> 10:15.040
- A flutter? A wager?
- Or maybe not.

10:15.042 --> 10:17.502
You've obviously got a massive,
what's it?

10:17.504 --> 10:22.717
- Lots of words.
- Vocabulary. Lexicon. Wordhoard.

10:23.676 --> 10:25.176
That's very good.

10:25.178 --> 10:27.054
What do you think?

10:28.556 --> 10:30.350
If... we said...

10:31.226 --> 10:31.932
five?

10:31.934 --> 10:35.772
You're a confident man, Arthur.

10:36.439 --> 10:40.358
Oh, I haven't got 500
to spare, unfortunately.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.278
- Oh, well...
- I've got 200. Is that okay?

10:43.280 --> 10:44.320
Or two...

10:44.322 --> 10:46.447
20, in fact. But call it 200.

10:46.449 --> 10:48.660
Never bet your last pound, eh?

10:49.536 --> 10:50.995
Two hundred?

10:53.956 --> 10:55.458
Sure. Why not?

11:01.381 --> 11:02.965
Ladies first.

11:03.883 --> 11:07.011
Oh. And I can bingo.

11:08.763 --> 11:10.638
That's when
you can play all seven

11:10.640 --> 11:11.889
of your letters in one go.

11:11.891 --> 11:13.391
You get an extra 50 points
for that.

11:13.393 --> 11:16.101
Oh, that's good, isn't it?
Bingo, eh.

11:16.103 --> 11:18.565
You learn something new
every day.

11:23.778 --> 11:27.488
Xi. That's a word, is it?
Is that a word?

11:27.490 --> 11:29.990
It's a letter
in the Greek alphabet. Alpha,

11:29.992 --> 11:33.578
- beta, gamma, delta, epsilon...
- So it's not a word.

11:33.580 --> 11:36.581
- It's a letter.
- No, it's a word. It's, erm,

11:36.583 --> 11:39.794
it's a word for a letter
of the Greek alphabet.

11:42.464 --> 11:46.341
- M... What?
- Muzjiks? Is that not a word?

11:46.343 --> 11:47.967
I know I've heard it
somewhere before,

11:47.969 --> 11:51.387
- but if you haven't, then.
- Dictionary.

11:51.389 --> 11:54.182
Arthur, it looks like a word.
Play on.

11:54.184 --> 11:57.187
I could change it to Muzak.

12:01.148 --> 12:01.772
"Muzjik...

12:01.774 --> 12:07.071
- an indentured Russian peasant."
- I knew I'd heard it before.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.697
- Where?
- Where what?

12:09.699 --> 12:11.073
Where did you hear that?

12:11.075 --> 12:12.700
That's a very unusual word.

12:12.702 --> 12:15.077
It's not exactly
in every-day use, is it?

12:15.079 --> 12:17.538
Come on down to Muzjiks-R-Us
for all

12:17.540 --> 12:22.293
- your indentured peasant needs.
- Arthur, it's a word.

12:22.295 --> 12:25.298
- What's it score?
- Er...

12:26.466 --> 12:30.885
- A hundred and seventeen.
- That's really good.

12:30.887 --> 12:31.927
Murmansk, by the way.

12:31.929 --> 12:35.306
I think I heard it in Murmansk.
When I was in the Merchant Navy.

12:35.308 --> 12:38.019
We were in and out of Murmansk.

12:39.562 --> 12:42.104
It's what they call
the storyteller in West Africa.

12:42.106 --> 12:45.443
- When I was on the Gold Coast...
- Just play the word.

12:48.070 --> 12:49.154
Esrom?

12:49.156 --> 12:51.199
I think it's a font.

12:51.616 --> 12:54.492
Actually, it's a cheese.
Made by Trappist monks.

12:54.494 --> 12:57.203
The stinkiest cheese
in the world.

12:57.205 --> 12:57.953
Oh,

12:57.955 --> 13:00.500
it looks like I've bingo'd too.

13:01.334 --> 13:04.043
It's an Italian card game.
You have two teams...

13:04.045 --> 13:06.130
Yeah, I know what Scopone is.

13:09.592 --> 13:10.966
I was going to play quartz.

13:10.968 --> 13:14.554
- You beat him to the q.
- Is that right, Arthur?

13:14.556 --> 13:16.556
What's "qi" when it's at home?

13:16.558 --> 13:20.643
It's, um, life energy
in Chinese philosophy.

13:20.645 --> 13:23.813
My aroma therapist
is always talking about qi.

13:23.815 --> 13:26.901
I have aromatherapy for stress.

13:27.068 --> 13:29.026
You'd know about it
if you ever listened

13:29.028 --> 13:31.404
- to a word I said.
- Well, I didn't know

13:31.406 --> 13:32.197
about it, did I?

13:32.199 --> 13:33.489
He doesn't know anything
about me.

13:33.491 --> 13:36.116
- I know you do aromatherapy.
- You don't do aromatherapy.

13:36.118 --> 13:38.705
- You have it.
- Like chicken pox.

13:38.996 --> 13:40.788
I have stress.

13:40.790 --> 13:43.876
You can probably see
where I get it from.

13:48.340 --> 13:53.008
- Ti. A drink with jam and bread.
- That's not how you spell it.

13:53.010 --> 13:54.929
Not tea.

13:55.263 --> 13:55.761
Ti.

13:55.763 --> 13:58.681
- Do-re-me-fa-so-la...
- He's right.

13:58.683 --> 14:00.352
I know I'm right.

14:01.936 --> 14:04.814
It's a firearm with a...

14:05.273 --> 14:07.400
you know this, don't you?

14:14.491 --> 14:17.116
- What did you do that for?
- What?

14:17.118 --> 14:18.909
What did you get for that?

14:18.911 --> 14:22.747
Six. Six points.
Why did you do that?

14:22.749 --> 14:25.250
I was going to use that "men".
I was going to turn it

14:25.252 --> 14:28.628
into "Anadyomene".
Sixty-seven points.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.340
Where are you going?

14:30.465 --> 14:34.093
What's wrong? It's only a game.

14:36.929 --> 14:39.557
I'm going to take a leak.

14:40.057 --> 14:41.434
Oh...

14:41.559 --> 14:42.894
sorry.

14:44.354 --> 14:45.813
Go on then.

14:52.737 --> 14:54.279
I'm sorry about this.

14:54.281 --> 14:57.657
- He's on edge.
- I can see that.

14:57.659 --> 14:59.702
He's not always like this.

14:59.827 --> 15:02.162
He used to be a singer,
can you believe?

15:02.164 --> 15:04.372
- A singer?
- Sessions. You know.

15:04.374 --> 15:07.500
Remember back in the day
when they used to do those...

15:07.502 --> 15:10.378
top 20 hits
but not by the original artists.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.963
- Pickwick?
- PickwickTop of the Pops.

15:12.965 --> 15:16.093
- No.
- He was the Pickwick singer.

15:16.969 --> 15:21.724
He's been them all. Ken Dodd.
Freddy Mercury.

15:24.352 --> 15:28.190
- He never sings anymore.
- Oh, that's a shame.

15:31.943 --> 15:33.695
We lost our son.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.864
He went missing.

15:37.574 --> 15:39.784
We haven't seen him since.

15:40.410 --> 15:41.075
He was 19.

15:41.077 --> 15:44.579
That's why we're here.
The police have found a body.

15:44.581 --> 15:47.124
It might be the body of our son.

15:47.917 --> 15:51.296
Oh, that's terrible.
I'm sorry about that.

15:52.505 --> 15:53.963
You think it's...

15:53.965 --> 15:57.385
it's the not knowing
that's the hardest.

15:58.386 --> 15:59.677
But tomorrow,
maybe we will know.

15:59.679 --> 16:03.475
And maybe we'll wish
we were back to not knowing, eh?

16:07.770 --> 16:09.645
Hope is a great friend.

16:09.647 --> 16:11.065
Yeah.

16:12.609 --> 16:14.777
He was Bonnie Tyler once.

16:15.069 --> 16:17.320
- Bonnie Tyler?
- Yeah.

16:17.322 --> 16:20.030
He sang the Pickwick version
of "It's a Heartache".

16:20.032 --> 16:22.827
You'd never have known
it wasn't her.

16:39.677 --> 16:41.804
We thought it would all be...

16:42.680 --> 16:44.349
over with today.

16:46.809 --> 16:48.645
But when we got here...

16:49.521 --> 16:51.229
the official
who runs the morgue,

16:51.231 --> 16:53.149
can you believe this...

16:53.650 --> 16:55.150
is on a job share.

16:55.152 --> 16:58.070
Had to leave early. Childcare.

17:03.785 --> 17:06.329
So. Anadyomene?

17:08.580 --> 17:12.082
I'm going to take "Amen"
off the board.

17:12.084 --> 17:14.042
Alan doesn't mind, do you, Alan?

17:14.045 --> 17:16.253
No, no, not at all.
Part of the fun

17:16.256 --> 17:18.840
is the magic of lovely words.

18:08.057 --> 18:09.351
Dad?

18:09.476 --> 18:11.644
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:12.061 --> 18:15.898
You know me.
I can't sleep without a walk.

18:18.193 --> 18:20.153
Ever since, you know.

18:23.948 --> 18:27.535
I used to go out looking
for him.

18:28.745 --> 18:32.332
Just walking the streets,
you know.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.628
It's just a habit now. A ritual.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.713
I know.

18:41.799 --> 18:43.301
Bonnie Tyler.

18:44.927 --> 18:45.468
What?

18:45.470 --> 18:49.975
♪ It's a Heartache
Nothing but a heartache... ♪

18:50.392 --> 18:51.726

18:53.686 --> 18:56.063

Bonnie Tyler.

18:57.023 --> 18:59.982
PickwickTop of the Pops

18:59.984 --> 19:02.236

Yeah.

19:12.789 --> 19:14.872
♪ Nothing but a fool's game ♪

19:14.874 --> 19:19.128
It was for him, anyway.
Two hundred I took off him.

19:20.963 --> 19:22.129
You did what?

19:22.131 --> 19:23.548
I beat him.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.466
You hustled him?
You hustled Bonnie Tyler...

19:25.468 --> 19:29.139
I didn't hustle him.
I smashed him.

19:30.265 --> 19:32.097
Did you use your extra "z"
on him?

19:32.099 --> 19:33.601
You what?

19:33.935 --> 19:35.310
"You can't play jazz in Scrabble

19:35.312 --> 19:38.440
because there's only one 'z'
in the set."

19:38.523 --> 19:39.857
And?

19:40.650 --> 19:43.110
You played jazz that night.

19:44.946 --> 19:46.571
You played it off "zygote".

19:46.573 --> 19:49.949
Top right-hand corner.
Triple word score,

19:49.951 --> 19:51.869
scored off the board.

19:58.710 --> 20:01.502
They're going up there
themselves tomorrow.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.172
- Up where?
- The morgue.

20:04.174 --> 20:05.798
They've got a son
who went missing.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.511
They're gonna take a look
at a body.

20:08.886 --> 20:10.761
That's the same body
we're going to look at.

20:10.763 --> 20:12.722
The one that might
be our Michael?

20:12.724 --> 20:14.309
That's right.

20:17.354 --> 20:18.686
Their son goes missing.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.313
They're going to look
at the body.

20:20.315 --> 20:23.358
And you hustle them
out of 200 quid?

20:23.360 --> 20:27.530
- Who are you?
- When you put it like that.

20:29.073 --> 20:32.950
It started off as a game,
then when I found out

20:32.952 --> 20:34.787
I... I seemed to...

20:37.499 --> 20:39.709
I got the feeling that...

20:42.379 --> 20:43.919
if I let him beat me,
it would be our Michael

20:43.921 --> 20:48.134
and if I won, it would be
their lad. I know it's mad.

21:01.773 --> 21:03.439
What are you doing here?

21:03.441 --> 21:05.360
This is where we, er...

21:08.863 --> 21:11.697
- Were you waiting for us?
- No.

21:11.699 --> 21:14.244
We're here for the same...

21:14.869 --> 21:17.289
my lad went missing too.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.250
Oh.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.084
You didn't say.

21:22.294 --> 21:23.795
I didn't like...

21:23.878 --> 21:26.798
You were telling me about yours
and...

21:28.466 --> 21:30.760
It was good of you to listen.

21:32.011 --> 21:33.513
If I'd known...

21:33.846 --> 21:35.598
You weren't to know.

21:40.187 --> 21:41.688
Mr. Mellor?

21:44.982 --> 21:46.276
I'll go.

21:54.075 --> 21:56.367
I thought
you were a woman.

21:56.369 --> 21:58.413
Childcare issues.

21:58.830 --> 22:01.664
No, I, I have a three-year-old
and, er...

22:01.666 --> 22:03.999
I'm on my own. So, you know.
Well,

22:04.001 --> 22:05.668
- just the two of us.
- Oh. Right.

22:05.670 --> 22:07.547
- Sorry.
- Just in here.

22:12.510 --> 22:13.468
I'm, er...

22:13.470 --> 22:17.056
- I'm not sure I'm ready.
- No, no. No, that's fine.

22:17.182 --> 22:18.641
That's fine.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.908
What my dad did
last night...

22:37.910 --> 22:40.037
you'll have to excuse him.

22:41.206 --> 22:43.833
It takes us all
in different ways.

22:43.958 --> 22:47.295
Oh. We know that,
don't we, Arthur?

22:48.671 --> 22:51.297
It was nice to have something
to take our mind off it

22:51.299 --> 22:52.590
to be honest.

22:56.012 --> 22:59.682
We should be apologising to him,
really.

23:03.561 --> 23:05.311
Well, if I can
make it up to you.

23:05.313 --> 23:07.148
No, no. It's all right.

23:13.112 --> 23:16.241
He probably thought
you were millionaires.

23:17.909 --> 23:19.159
Rock stars.

23:19.161 --> 23:23.331
We had all of those records.
He used to get them for us...

23:26.083 --> 23:26.999
You... you told him

23:27.001 --> 23:29.835
- about that. You...
- Well, it... it's not a secret,

23:29.837 --> 23:31.381
is it? I mean...

23:31.464 --> 23:33.175
it was then, but...

23:40.265 --> 23:42.016
What are you doing?

23:42.099 --> 23:43.643
I know it was...

23:43.768 --> 23:44.809
what was it? I think it was

23:44.811 --> 23:47.562
- a couple hundred quid, was it?
- No. Don't be daft.

23:47.564 --> 23:49.564
What are you talking about?

23:49.566 --> 23:50.565
Dad's side bet.

23:50.567 --> 23:53.820
- He shouldn't have done that.
- Bet?

23:54.487 --> 23:55.361
He said it was...

23:55.363 --> 23:58.448
- a couple of hundred.
- You bet hundreds of pounds

23:58.450 --> 24:01.953
- on a game of Scrabble?
- Not hundreds.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.162
Two hundred.

24:04.164 --> 24:07.167
- I thought he was...
- He took you.

24:07.334 --> 24:09.959
He took you
for the fool you are.

24:09.961 --> 24:12.253
- He cheated.
- I'm sure he did.

24:12.255 --> 24:13.087
No.

24:13.089 --> 24:15.215
He's just a lot cleverer
than you are.

24:15.217 --> 24:16.131
You keep that, son.

24:16.133 --> 24:19.260
That's the price
a fool has to pay for...

24:19.262 --> 24:21.095
for acting like a fool.

24:21.097 --> 24:23.015
That's the fool tax.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.437
It wasn't him.
I knew it wouldn't be.

25:11.439 --> 25:13.941
All the best then. Come on.

25:22.409 --> 25:24.452
Are you sure you wouldn't...

25:25.537 --> 25:26.829
No.

25:34.546 --> 25:36.212
Let's hear the new jingle.

25:37.715 --> 25:39.340
♪ I want you to know... ♪

25:39.342 --> 25:41.929
Small Faces. Yes!

25:42.011 --> 25:44.595
Or in my case, Arthur somebody!

25:44.597 --> 25:47.307
So not particularly "yes"
at all.

25:47.309 --> 25:51.354
I never thought of that.
He probably sang this as well.

25:51.938 --> 25:54.106
- Why?
- Why what?

25:54.566 --> 25:56.818
Second best of everything.

25:57.319 --> 25:59.109
You didn't let us touch
the real albums,

25:59.111 --> 26:00.861
it was only the Pickwick ones.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.822
We played Scrobble
not Scrabble...

26:02.824 --> 26:03.614
It was the same.

26:03.616 --> 26:05.200
We didn't get proper Lego.
You always got us

26:05.202 --> 26:08.118
- some snide Lego.
- Ah, now, that was just as good.

26:08.120 --> 26:12.081
- Never Airfix, always Revell.
- Revell was more rock and roll.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.250
You didn't get us Action Man,
you got us something

26:14.252 --> 26:19.131
called Action Joe,
and he did not have grip hands.

26:20.049 --> 26:22.300
- Yeah, that wasn't good.
- Subbuteo?

26:22.302 --> 26:25.636
- No, Chad Valley Big League.
- Yes, yes.

26:25.638 --> 26:28.013
You've made your point. Go on.

26:28.015 --> 26:29.432
- What?
- Well, you also didn't have

26:29.434 --> 26:34.105
a mother, did you? Just a dad.
So, poor substitute there.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.913
Left hand down.

26:51.956 --> 26:52.872
I can manage.

26:52.874 --> 26:55.791
I could back a bloody Panzer
out of here.

26:55.793 --> 26:57.335
What was that?

26:57.337 --> 27:01.216
I said get back in the car.
Get out of the cold.

27:01.758 --> 27:02.673
Sure.

28:47.322 --> 28:49.449
Your father's back.

28:49.949 --> 28:52.410
It wasn't your Uncle Michael.

28:53.911 --> 28:55.955
I think he's relieved.

28:56.623 --> 29:00.752
Well, it's hard to know what's
for the best isn't it. I mean...

29:01.503 --> 29:03.669
Well, obviously
the best would be...

29:03.671 --> 29:06.922
if they found him
and he was alive and well,

29:06.924 --> 29:09.135
having a lovely life.

29:12.514 --> 29:15.183
Or would it? I mean...

29:15.683 --> 29:17.642
That'd be hard, wouldn't it?

29:17.644 --> 29:20.895
To find out that he's been happy
all this time and just,

29:20.897 --> 29:22.440
you know...

29:22.774 --> 29:24.317
shunning you.

29:24.442 --> 29:26.778
Letting you go through all this.

29:27.612 --> 29:29.781
Like the sightings.

29:30.114 --> 29:32.532
You know people contact
your grandad

29:32.534 --> 29:35.495
and say they've seen Michael.

29:35.662 --> 29:38.163
Some of them say
they've talked to him.

29:38.165 --> 29:41.332
There was one in Argentina.

29:41.334 --> 29:42.919
Imagine.

29:43.545 --> 29:44.835
I'm not saying...

29:44.837 --> 29:47.505
it'd be better if he was dead.

29:47.507 --> 29:50.927
I'm just saying
if you had to choose.

30:51.028 --> 30:52.614
Everything okay?

30:53.906 --> 30:56.117
Have you been there long?

31:01.038 --> 31:02.915
Don't worry about it.

31:08.755 --> 31:09.504
Alan.

31:09.506 --> 31:12.382
It's lovely to see you.
Have you eaten? Uh,

31:12.384 --> 31:14.800
there's plenty of left overs.
I'll get you a bowl.

31:14.802 --> 31:16.511
That'd be lovely.
If you're sure there's enough.

31:16.513 --> 31:19.847
I'd be just as happy with a bit
of toast and Marmite.

31:19.849 --> 31:21.393
No, no...

31:25.772 --> 31:28.900
You know you can't take Marmite
into Canada?

31:29.025 --> 31:31.276
Because Marmite
has a secret ingredient.

31:31.278 --> 31:32.860
And the Canadian government
took the view

31:32.862 --> 31:34.445
that not telling them
the secret ingredient

31:34.447 --> 31:36.989
was tantamount to asking them
to import something

31:36.991 --> 31:38.073
without knowing what it is.

31:38.075 --> 31:42.662
That's why the people of Canada
have no Marmite. Imagine.

31:42.664 --> 31:44.914
The second largest country
on Earth.

31:44.916 --> 31:47.208
More or less
nine million square miles

31:47.210 --> 31:48.793
and not one jar of Marmite.

31:48.795 --> 31:51.756
- How do they survive?
- Vegemite.

31:53.341 --> 31:55.092
A poor substitute...

31:55.218 --> 31:58.428
but then sometimes
a poor substitute

31:58.430 --> 32:00.097
is all there is.

32:01.183 --> 32:02.973
- Is Jack out then?
- Yeah.

32:02.975 --> 32:04.517
Upstairs.

32:04.519 --> 32:06.977
- Gaming.
- That's a worry, isn't it?

32:06.979 --> 32:08.396
Why would that be a worry?

32:08.398 --> 32:11.816
He's at home.
He's not on the streets.

32:11.818 --> 32:13.151
He hasn't gone missing.

32:13.153 --> 32:15.653
You didn't hear about the girl
in China then?

32:15.655 --> 32:18.323
I did hear about the girl
in China.

32:18.325 --> 32:21.617
- Imagine that. It is a worry.
- I know China's different,

32:21.619 --> 32:22.993
- but...
- Exactly. We don't want him

32:22.995 --> 32:25.330
- to end up like her.
- You should watch him.

32:25.332 --> 32:26.497
- I do try.
- This business

32:26.499 --> 32:28.916
is probably affecting him
more than you think.

32:28.918 --> 32:30.293
- Do you think so?
- No!

32:30.295 --> 32:32.337
- I think you might be right.
- He's got exams!

32:32.339 --> 32:35.381
He's doing A-levels.
They're stressed.

32:35.383 --> 32:36.632
They're all stressed.

32:36.634 --> 32:38.718
They're supposed to be stressed.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.011
If you can't be stressed
about your A-levels

32:41.013 --> 32:42.472
what can you be stressed about?

32:42.474 --> 32:46.058
He doesn't seem stressed.
He seems more, sort of,

32:46.060 --> 32:47.643
to be, you know...

32:47.645 --> 32:48.519
playing that game,

32:48.521 --> 32:52.106
- which does beg the question...
- The girl in China question.

32:52.108 --> 32:53.485
Exactly.

33:05.830 --> 33:10.335
You know why
he's saying Jack's stressed?

33:11.253 --> 33:12.545
No.

33:12.837 --> 33:15.131
Because he's stressed himself.

33:15.590 --> 33:16.381
Is he?

33:16.383 --> 33:19.384
Classic transference
of anxiety.

33:19.386 --> 33:22.094
He was stressed
on the drive then, was he?

33:22.096 --> 33:23.137
Oh, yeah.

33:23.139 --> 33:26.098
Very defensive. Quite guarded.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.687
Do you not find him
a bit passive aggressive?

33:29.937 --> 33:34.609
I do, sometimes, but you have
to make allowances.

33:48.373 --> 33:49.707
Oh.

33:50.833 --> 33:52.252
A present.

33:52.627 --> 33:55.380
That's kind of you, Alan.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.301
What is it?

33:59.717 --> 34:01.176
It's a thing.

34:01.178 --> 34:03.137
Doing labels.

34:05.348 --> 34:09.018
He was putting labels
on everything when we were kids.

34:09.726 --> 34:10.435
"Jumpers only".

34:10.437 --> 34:12.937
"Please fold towels
before replacing".

34:12.938 --> 34:14.647
"Please replace after use"...

34:14.649 --> 34:17.775
It helped keep things
running smoothly, you know.

34:17.777 --> 34:20.735
But also the font, look...

34:20.737 --> 34:22.447
it has an elegant precision.

34:22.449 --> 34:24.864
You don't really see that font
anywhere else. I don't know

34:24.867 --> 34:28.246
what it's called. But I thought
you'd appreciate it.

34:36.003 --> 34:37.297
Well...

34:38.130 --> 34:39.672
it's getting late.

34:39.674 --> 34:41.259
Yeah, it is.

34:44.929 --> 34:47.681
Obviously, you're welcome
to stay.

34:48.139 --> 34:49.891
Well you would be,

34:49.976 --> 34:51.603
only, um...

34:51.936 --> 34:54.562
we don't really have
a spare bed, do we?

34:54.563 --> 34:57.315
Just the bunk in Jack's room,
so.

34:57.317 --> 34:59.819
I'm sure that would be fine.

35:21.258 --> 35:22.759
Which is you?

35:23.009 --> 35:24.967
The one with the big cleavage,
that's you?

35:24.969 --> 35:28.638
There is total sexual equality
among the undead.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.974
It doesn't make any difference
which gender you are.

35:31.976 --> 35:35.853
So why choose to be a girl
with enormous breasts?

35:35.855 --> 35:39.984
- Stop saying things like that.
- Not breasts.

35:41.110 --> 35:42.445
Bosoms.

35:43.112 --> 35:44.320
Assets.

35:44.322 --> 35:45.696
Glands.

35:45.698 --> 35:50.493
- Bazookas. Which do you prefer?
- Other players are more polite

35:50.495 --> 35:51.827
to you if you're a girl.

35:51.829 --> 35:55.748
It looks a bit choppy
if you don't mind me saying.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.293
- What?
- It's not running very smoothly,

35:58.295 --> 36:00.545
is it? It's slow
and then it's jumpy.

36:00.547 --> 36:02.380
Do you want me to change
the settings for you?

36:02.382 --> 36:06.303
- I'm in the middle of an action.
- Only take a mo.

36:55.935 --> 36:57.142
Grandad.

36:57.144 --> 36:59.689
- What?
- That's my bed.

37:00.940 --> 37:01.856
Yeah?

37:01.858 --> 37:05.737
You didn't expect me
to climb up there, did you?

37:06.238 --> 37:07.362
Or did you?

37:07.364 --> 37:08.946
I could give it a go.

37:08.948 --> 37:11.491
No, no. No,
I didn't expect that, Grandad.

37:14.287 --> 37:16.289
I'm saying me prayers.

37:31.679 --> 37:33.348
Jack!

37:33.806 --> 37:35.141
What?

37:35.392 --> 37:36.684
Nothing.

37:36.768 --> 37:38.102
Nothing.

37:38.895 --> 37:39.519
We just...

37:39.521 --> 37:43.858
don't normally see you
for breakfast, that's all.

37:56.871 --> 38:00.041
- Jack.
- All right. All right.

38:00.375 --> 38:04.086
Grandad's up there
and he's playing on my computer.

38:04.546 --> 38:06.631
Where else am I supposed to go?

38:07.048 --> 38:08.923
Well, I'm sure
it's very difficult for you

38:08.925 --> 38:11.301
having Grandad in your bedroom,
but...

38:11.303 --> 38:15.097
it's very nice for us
having you for breakfast.

38:15.557 --> 38:18.601
Oh, I'll give you a lift
if you like.

38:19.477 --> 38:20.726
Bye then!

38:20.728 --> 38:22.061
Why doesn't he want
a lift?

38:22.063 --> 38:24.691
You drive past the school
every day.

38:24.982 --> 38:26.191
There's a girl.

38:26.193 --> 38:26.982
Oh.

38:26.984 --> 38:29.902
He walks past two bus stops
to be at the same bus stop

38:29.904 --> 38:33.283
as her. And he stands next
to her...

38:33.408 --> 38:35.285
but he doesn't speak.

38:35.452 --> 38:36.576
Really?

38:36.578 --> 38:38.371
How do you know that?

38:39.581 --> 38:41.166
It's a guess.

39:01.853 --> 39:05.313
Yeah, man.
Last night was quality.

39:05.315 --> 39:08.109
Yeah, we were going more
or less all night.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.654
Oh, we just listened to music,

39:11.863 --> 39:12.987
jammed.

39:12.989 --> 39:14.239
Wrote a few new songs.

39:14.241 --> 39:16.574
It was a good night, man.

39:16.576 --> 39:18.286
Jack!

39:19.621 --> 39:20.997
Woo-hoo!

39:21.373 --> 39:23.040
Breakfast.

39:23.291 --> 39:26.878
Do let me know if that's not
to your satisfaction.

39:33.176 --> 39:36.344
Half a million
registered players.

39:36.346 --> 39:37.637
I'm never short of a game.

39:37.639 --> 39:40.975
Does that mean you'll be staying
another night then?

39:41.768 --> 39:43.686
Unless it's a problem.

39:44.437 --> 39:46.856
No. No, it's not a problem.

39:47.982 --> 39:49.442
It's just...

39:50.902 --> 39:53.655
No, no, it's not a problem.

40:50.086 --> 40:54.090
Most of them play the board
not the man.

40:57.093 --> 40:58.886
Always play the man.

40:59.471 --> 41:02.096
Go for two letter words.

41:02.098 --> 41:04.432
They're your real friends.

41:04.434 --> 41:06.226
There are 101 two letter words.

41:06.228 --> 41:10.355
Five of them are letters
of the Greek alphabet

41:10.357 --> 41:15.360
Mu. M-U. Nu. N-U. Pi, obviously.

41:15.362 --> 41:17.237
And xi. X-I.

41:17.239 --> 41:21.532
And then you've got
your unusual ones like O-E, oe

41:21.534 --> 41:24.535
which is a wind
in the Faroe Islands.

41:24.537 --> 41:27.497
Did your father ever tell you
about your great-grandmother's

41:27.499 --> 41:30.791
shop? She had a shop,
sold all sorts.

41:30.793 --> 41:35.421
- Liquorice all sorts?
- No, all sorts of things.

41:35.423 --> 41:36.881
Bread, the papers.

41:36.883 --> 41:41.679
Hair nets were big business,
I seem to remember. Harpic.

41:42.639 --> 41:44.764
Are you telling me
a bedtime story?

41:44.766 --> 41:46.724
I'm telling you
your family history.

41:46.726 --> 41:50.102
Coal. She sold coal.
People would ask for five pound

41:50.104 --> 41:53.063
of potatoes and a bag of coal.
She'd go downstairs

41:53.065 --> 41:54.984
and get them the coal.

41:55.235 --> 41:55.733
Why?

41:55.735 --> 41:58.736
Why didn't she
just keep it upstairs?

41:58.738 --> 42:00.571
Ah. That's the point.

42:00.573 --> 42:02.365
One day someone
from the coal board,

42:02.367 --> 42:06.869
coal was nationalised then,
heard about this and thought,

42:06.871 --> 42:11.499
"we don't deliver to that shop
so how come she sells coal?"

42:11.501 --> 42:12.375
Go on.

42:12.377 --> 42:17.507
Well, it turns out
there's a seam in the cellar.

42:17.674 --> 42:21.551
The cellar of the shop,
one wall of it had a coal seam

42:21.553 --> 42:22.302
running off it.

42:22.304 --> 42:23.969
If you asked her for coal,
she'd go down there,

42:23.971 --> 42:27.598
pick up a pick axe and chop out
a bit of fresh coal for you.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.560
She was a part time
freelance coal miner,

42:30.562 --> 42:31.811
your great-grandmother.

42:31.813 --> 42:35.481
That story is completely untrue.

42:35.483 --> 42:39.111
That story is as true
as my name.

43:05.763 --> 43:06.262
Er.

43:06.264 --> 43:10.433
- Sorry I... I was just, um...
- No, good idea. Give it a go.

43:10.435 --> 43:12.645
Which one do you like best?

43:31.289 --> 43:34.751
- I've never been in here before.
- No.

43:52.519 --> 43:53.978
Stand straight.

43:54.812 --> 43:57.605
It's hard to gauge
the fall of the trouser

43:57.607 --> 43:59.607
without proper shoes.

43:59.609 --> 44:01.651
It's got to be Oxfords, really.
You might get away

44:01.653 --> 44:05.114
with a Chelsea boot.
Have you got a Chelsea boot?

44:05.657 --> 44:08.115
I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:08.117 --> 44:08.866
Ah.

44:08.868 --> 44:10.993
When this is done, the thing
you have to remember

44:10.995 --> 44:16.168
about these buttons is,
sometimes, always, never.

44:17.210 --> 44:17.750
What?

44:17.752 --> 44:19.335
The buttons, a man
keeps fastened. Sometimes.

44:19.337 --> 44:23.005
Always. Never. Now take it off
and we'll make it sing.

44:23.007 --> 44:28.680
You know how this suit needs
a bit of a tidy up? A trim?

44:31.098 --> 44:33.935
Same thing goes for your hair.

45:05.258 --> 45:08.634
You look spruce.
Doesn't he look spruce?

45:08.636 --> 45:11.013
Well, I wasn't sure it was him.

45:17.687 --> 45:20.022
Is it one of your grandad's?

45:21.816 --> 45:23.858
You haven't got a spare gun,
have you?

45:23.860 --> 45:27.320
- So I can shoot myself.
- Don't mutter.

45:27.322 --> 45:30.906
Your father mutters.
It's not endearing

45:30.908 --> 45:33.035
and it's not effective.

45:35.538 --> 45:38.958
I know it's inconvenient
with your grandad.

45:39.834 --> 45:41.751
It's not inconvenient.

45:41.753 --> 45:45.507
- It's disorientating.
- Awkward.

45:46.799 --> 45:48.426
Destabilising.

45:48.551 --> 45:52.222
- Confusing?
- Not confusing.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.182
Unsettling.

45:55.475 --> 45:57.101
Disquieting.

45:58.311 --> 45:59.435
Tense.

45:59.437 --> 46:01.731
Anyway it can't be helped.

46:02.940 --> 46:04.984
And er, well...

46:07.320 --> 46:09.406
you look spruce.

46:15.662 --> 46:19.372
Well, I would not want to play
Scrabble with you.

46:19.374 --> 46:20.373
Really?

46:20.375 --> 46:23.085
- Wouldn't you?
- Or your mum.

46:35.014 --> 46:36.349
Jack.

46:36.641 --> 46:38.685
Give you a lift if you like.

46:56.203 --> 46:59.829
So his brother went missing
and ever since then...

46:59.831 --> 47:01.164
The prodigal son.

47:01.166 --> 47:03.249
- What?
- Well, the prodigal son

47:03.251 --> 47:05.543
goes missing,
and then comes back,

47:05.545 --> 47:08.546
and the dad kills
the fatted calf and everything,

47:08.548 --> 47:09.422
gives him a ring.

47:09.424 --> 47:11.799
And then the other son, the one
that actually stayed behind

47:11.801 --> 47:14.053
to help him, he gets nothing.

47:15.054 --> 47:16.848
I hate the prodigal son.

47:19.141 --> 47:20.893
Then you'll like my dad.

47:27.317 --> 47:30.111
- Um, are we in the way?
- No.

47:30.278 --> 47:31.486
No, it's fine.

47:31.488 --> 47:35.992
- Are you eating with us?
- Is that okay?

47:36.784 --> 47:40.119
Yeah. And you can carry on
after food.

47:40.121 --> 47:42.624
I'll have well beaten him
by then.

48:12.612 --> 48:13.946
Good.

48:14.572 --> 48:16.073
Good game plan.

48:17.784 --> 48:18.991
Play the man not the board.

48:18.993 --> 48:24.081
- She's a girl, grandad.
- Me too, as a matter of fact.

48:24.416 --> 48:25.498
"Zo"?

48:25.500 --> 48:27.375
You can't have that.
Zoo's got two O's.

48:27.377 --> 48:31.796
- No. Actually, zo is a word.
- Are you sure?

48:31.798 --> 48:35.508
Definitely zo's a word.
What's that?

48:35.510 --> 48:37.262
"Oxycamphors".

48:37.637 --> 48:38.928
What's an oxycamphor?

48:38.930 --> 48:42.557
It's a chemical. I'm a chemist,
Alan. Remember.

48:42.559 --> 48:43.683
I'd check that if I were you.

48:43.685 --> 48:46.313
We're not checking
anything.

48:47.647 --> 48:49.106
She's a chemist.

48:49.232 --> 48:52.610
If she says oxycamphors
is a chemical...

48:52.860 --> 48:54.194
it's a chemical.

48:54.196 --> 48:55.903
I don't mind people checking.

48:55.905 --> 48:59.242
Anything that spins the game out
to be honest.

49:00.117 --> 49:01.617
"Gu" by the way...

49:01.619 --> 49:03.453
is a traditional
stringed instrument

49:03.455 --> 49:06.789
- from the Shetland Islands.
- I'm impressed.

49:06.791 --> 49:09.085
But I still want to check it.

49:10.212 --> 49:13.421
I also want to know
if the dictionary tells us

49:13.423 --> 49:14.839
why Jack would ever know
the name

49:14.841 --> 49:18.926
of a traditional string thing
from the Falklands.

49:18.928 --> 49:20.472
Shetlands.

49:20.638 --> 49:22.597
And what's "yo"?

49:22.599 --> 49:24.807
You can't have yo. What is it?

49:24.809 --> 49:28.896
- Clearly, it's half a yo-yo.
- It's a greeting.

49:29.439 --> 49:30.980
Greetings are allowed.

49:30.982 --> 49:33.693
Thank you, Mr. Jack's Dad.

49:34.194 --> 49:36.402
There it is. Oxycamphor.
You were right.

49:36.404 --> 49:38.238
She knows damn well
she's right.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.367
What are you talking about?

49:40.992 --> 49:42.783
What was the next one, "yo"?

49:42.785 --> 49:44.704
Don't look that up.

49:45.121 --> 49:48.914
I just said it's a greeting
and greetings are allowed.

49:48.916 --> 49:53.253
You were forever using "hi"
and "ho". You know "yo" is okay.

49:53.255 --> 49:56.549
Did you really play "ho",
Grandad?

49:56.966 --> 49:58.216
As in...

49:58.218 --> 49:59.802
"hos and cars".

50:02.430 --> 50:04.013
I said,
don't look that up.

50:04.015 --> 50:06.976
Dad! You're not even playing.

50:35.172 --> 50:36.212
Dad?

51:43.906 --> 51:46.909
Sue?

51:48.370 --> 51:49.996
Sue is that you?

51:51.038 --> 51:52.582
Peter!

51:53.250 --> 51:54.749
It's me. Your dad.

51:54.751 --> 51:56.751
Sorry.

51:56.753 --> 51:58.253
You all right?

51:58.255 --> 52:00.465
Yeah, I was just passing.

52:05.678 --> 52:08.012
You don't have to get out.
It's fine.

52:08.014 --> 52:12.225
- My house, your house.
- I was finished anyway.

52:12.227 --> 52:13.936
Cup of tea?

52:14.937 --> 52:16.898
I just wanted to say...

52:17.482 --> 52:19.108
about last night.

52:19.859 --> 52:24.111
It's fine. No problem. Come on.
Cup of tea.

52:24.113 --> 52:25.905
I don't know how we keep...

52:25.907 --> 52:29.452
rubbing each other up, you know,
the wrong way.

52:29.911 --> 52:32.664
I think it's to do with Michael,
isn't it?

52:32.747 --> 52:34.166
Probably.

52:34.291 --> 52:37.252
Hey, come and look at this.

52:40.713 --> 52:43.464
Don't worry about me trying
to communicate with you

52:43.466 --> 52:45.009
or anything.

52:56.771 --> 52:59.649
Where have you seen
those words before?

53:00.358 --> 53:01.651
Erm.

53:01.818 --> 53:03.736
In a game of Scrabble.

53:04.404 --> 53:06.823
Our Michael used to play them.

53:09.242 --> 53:10.577
What?

53:11.994 --> 53:14.456
All good players
use those words.

53:15.081 --> 53:17.250
They're two letter words.

53:17.959 --> 53:20.084
You've got them written down
here.

53:20.086 --> 53:22.587
It's him. I'm sure of it.

53:22.589 --> 53:24.422
He's fast
and he's got lovely words

53:24.424 --> 53:25.715
and he always maximises
the score.

53:25.717 --> 53:28.050
And he's not sentimental,
you know. He doesn't just play

53:28.052 --> 53:30.678
a word because it looks nice.
It's him.

53:30.680 --> 53:35.350
"Zo". He played zo that night.
You said there was no such word

53:35.352 --> 53:37.562
and that's when he walked out.

53:40.106 --> 53:41.272
What?

53:41.274 --> 53:44.777
You said there was no such word
and that's what...

53:50.367 --> 53:52.118
Are you blaming me?

53:56.289 --> 53:57.455
Who...

53:57.457 --> 53:58.706
- What?
- I told you to stay

53:58.708 --> 54:01.125
- in the bathroom.
- I did stay in there,

54:01.127 --> 54:03.794
but I was turning into a prune
in that bath.

54:03.796 --> 54:08.134
Anyway, why should I hide?
Done nothing wrong.

54:09.135 --> 54:11.679
I know you. I've met you.

54:11.971 --> 54:14.389
- You're married.
- Not any more, son.

54:14.391 --> 54:16.432
Looking for our Nigel
was the only thing

54:16.434 --> 54:18.142
that kept us together...

54:18.144 --> 54:20.188
and once we found him...

54:21.523 --> 54:25.277
recriminations, boredom,
you name it.

54:26.444 --> 54:28.738
What, what have you been...

54:32.492 --> 54:34.202
Have you had sex?

54:34.286 --> 54:36.035
- Have you had sex in my bed?
- Well, we weren't going

54:36.037 --> 54:38.329
to have sex in Jack's bed,
were we? It's a bunk bed.

54:38.331 --> 54:41.582
I'm not Tarzan. Anyway,
it didn't feel right, did it,

54:41.584 --> 54:43.753
having sex in the kid's room?

54:44.754 --> 54:46.296
You had sex in my bed?

54:46.298 --> 54:50.425
How could you do that?
Even I don't have sex in my bed.

54:50.427 --> 54:52.468
- Don't you?
- Son...

54:52.470 --> 54:55.012
you must ask yourself
why you're making so much fuss.

54:55.014 --> 54:57.725
I mean, what harm are we doing?

54:58.142 --> 55:00.601
Anyway you should be proud
of your dad.

55:00.603 --> 55:03.438
Let me tell you,
he's a very considerate

55:03.440 --> 55:06.106
- and accomplished lover.
- Oh, God. Shut up.

55:06.108 --> 55:07.233
- No, seriously.
- Please.

55:07.235 --> 55:08.359
- He's got empathy.
- Please.

55:08.361 --> 55:10.863
- No one has ever...
- Please stop talking.

55:14.159 --> 55:15.702
I'm gonna go.

55:17.370 --> 55:20.790
And when I come back
this hasn't happened.

55:21.416 --> 55:22.750
Okay?

55:38.600 --> 55:40.142
Yeah.

55:40.560 --> 55:43.143
Yeah, yeah.
You see the thing is,

55:43.145 --> 55:45.940
the traffic is horrendous.

55:46.358 --> 55:48.818
Mm-hmm. I mean really.

55:49.944 --> 55:51.319
So let's reschedule.

55:51.321 --> 55:54.532
Then I can, er,
get my ducks in a row.

55:55.908 --> 55:58.203
No, I don't mean literal ducks.

56:00.037 --> 56:02.374
No I... I don't do ducks.

56:04.376 --> 56:06.753
I don't do chipmunks either.

56:06.961 --> 56:08.919
Chipmunks are, I mean chipmunks

56:08.921 --> 56:12.133
aren't even
an indigenous species.

56:12.634 --> 56:15.762
And we've already agreed
on squirrels.

56:16.221 --> 56:19.432
Hmm. Squirrels eating ice cream.

56:20.267 --> 56:22.394
Who's not gonna love that?

56:41.704 --> 56:43.165
What?

56:58.346 --> 56:59.681
Alan.

57:01.391 --> 57:02.850
No problem.

57:28.376 --> 57:30.170
Grandad's gone.

57:30.462 --> 57:32.672
Gone? Gone where?

57:32.755 --> 57:33.379
Gone gone.

57:33.381 --> 57:37.635
His bags are gone. The lot.
He's not answering his phone.

57:37.844 --> 57:38.468
He's left.

57:38.470 --> 57:41.262
Did you say something to him.
Have you had a row?

57:41.264 --> 57:42.597
What? No. Ask him.

57:42.599 --> 57:46.476
I never said anything to him
apart from "goodnight".

57:46.478 --> 57:47.435
We have to find him.

57:47.437 --> 57:49.939
What do you mean
we have to find him?

57:50.022 --> 57:51.689
He's a missing person.

57:51.691 --> 57:53.358
What are you on about,
he's a missing person?

57:53.360 --> 57:56.319
He's a grown man. He's gone back
to his own home.

57:56.321 --> 57:59.197
I don't know why he left it
in the first place.

57:59.199 --> 57:59.822
Mum.

57:59.824 --> 58:03.159
- We should find him.
- Definitely. Erm.

58:03.161 --> 58:06.206
What? Have you both gone crazy?

58:06.373 --> 58:07.330
He didn't live here.

58:07.332 --> 58:09.582
Therefore the fact
that he's not here

58:09.584 --> 58:10.958
does not make him lost.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.668
On the contrary,
it means he's gone back

58:12.670 --> 58:15.171
- to where he's supposed to be.
- How do you know that

58:15.173 --> 58:16.922
if he's not answering his phone?

58:16.924 --> 58:18.883
Maybe you should go round
and check.

58:18.885 --> 58:20.468
He's lived in that house
for 50 years.

58:20.470 --> 58:24.722
Not once in all of that time
have I ever considered going

58:24.724 --> 58:27.477
to see if he's still
living there.

58:32.440 --> 58:33.775
What?

58:50.542 --> 58:51.876
Dad?

59:58.193 --> 59:59.275
- Is he in?
- No, he's not.

59:59.277 --> 01:00:00.693
- Do you know where...
- Where is he?

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:02.947
I don't know where he is.
Do you?

01:00:03.114 --> 01:00:06.574
- He's not in there. I've looked.
- I know but...

01:00:06.576 --> 01:00:08.784
can I have a look around?
I've never been inside.

01:00:08.786 --> 01:00:11.454
- He's funny about it.
- Well, if he's funny about it,

01:00:11.456 --> 01:00:14.626
it's not for me to be serious
about it, is it?

01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:15.291
But...

01:00:15.293 --> 01:00:18.380
well I thought there might be,
you know,

01:00:18.713 --> 01:00:19.337
a clue.

01:00:19.339 --> 01:00:23.174
If he's not said where he is,
maybe he doesn't want you

01:00:23.176 --> 01:00:24.592
to know where he is.

01:00:24.594 --> 01:00:28.179
We're supposed to be going
to this thing in Chester.

01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:31.268
He bought me tickets. A present.

01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:32.933
Why would he buy them
and not turn up?

01:00:32.935 --> 01:00:36.314
Why does he do
most of the things he does?

01:00:37.106 --> 01:00:39.984
Has he talked to you about this,
um...

01:00:40.067 --> 01:00:43.153
- Skinny what's-his-name?
- Thesaurus.

01:00:43.155 --> 01:00:45.070
He doesn't know anything
about him.

01:00:45.072 --> 01:00:46.906
Says he wants to meet him.
Everyone knows

01:00:46.908 --> 01:00:48.241
you should never arrange
to meet someone

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:50.493
that you only know
from the internet.

01:00:50.495 --> 01:00:51.286
It's dangerous.

01:00:51.288 --> 01:00:52.953
There was that girl,
wasn't there, from Barnsley,

01:00:52.955 --> 01:00:56.916
ran off with some guy
who turned out to be 30 stone.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:58.168
She was only 14.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:02.213
I don't think anyone's
been sexually grooming my dad.

01:01:02.215 --> 01:01:02.838
No,

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.804
but what if this Skinny fella
turns out to be a kid?

01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:09.262
And people, um...

01:01:09.264 --> 01:01:13.100
think it's your dad
who's doing the abducting?

01:01:14.394 --> 01:01:15.770
Jesus.

01:01:31.244 --> 01:01:32.745
Is this you?

01:01:38.835 --> 01:01:39.500
Yeah.

01:01:39.502 --> 01:01:41.963
- That's me and...
- Michael.

01:01:42.339 --> 01:01:44.131
The one who ran away.

01:01:46.008 --> 01:01:46.966
Is that him?

01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:48.803
That's him.

01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:50.805
The prodigal son.

01:01:55.393 --> 01:01:56.642
Are you okay?

01:01:58.188 --> 01:02:01.191
- Wait. I'll just get a, er...
- I'm...

01:02:01.441 --> 01:02:02.900
I'm fine.

01:02:09.157 --> 01:02:11.159
I'm not fine at all.

01:02:25.715 --> 01:02:27.008
Arthur?

01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:31.929
Arthur, I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:02:32.514 --> 01:02:36.643
I don't know. I don't know
what I was thinking of.

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:39.020
I need you.

01:02:40.062 --> 01:02:44.151
I'm so sorry. Could you come
and pick me up?

01:03:06.047 --> 01:03:07.340
Hi.

01:03:13.095 --> 01:03:15.012
I came here and I...

01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:17.350
I saw these pictures and...

01:03:18.518 --> 01:03:19.934
that's his...

01:03:19.936 --> 01:03:21.101
I remembered being in the morgue

01:03:21.103 --> 01:03:23.020
- looking at...
- All right.

01:03:23.022 --> 01:03:24.607
It's okay.

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:28.110
What was I thinking of?

01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:31.111
Is he mentally enfeebled
in any way?

01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:33.281
No more
than he ever was.

01:03:33.283 --> 01:03:35.618
Confused at all?

01:03:35.993 --> 01:03:38.869
No more
than the rest of us.

01:03:38.871 --> 01:03:40.037
I can take his details.

01:03:40.039 --> 01:03:42.790
- I'll get you a photo.
- If we get an unidentified body

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.793
or an injured person
that matches the description

01:03:45.795 --> 01:03:47.253
then sure,
we can give you a call

01:03:47.255 --> 01:03:49.839
- and ask you to come and...
- Don't do that.

01:03:49.841 --> 01:03:52.760
- I don't want to do that.
- Well then...

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:53.843
to be honest...

01:03:53.845 --> 01:03:56.971
he's hale and hearty.
He's past the age of consent.

01:03:56.973 --> 01:03:59.890
Unless he's waving round
unlicensed fire arms or driving

01:03:59.892 --> 01:04:02.560
without due care and attention,
then I don't see...

01:04:02.562 --> 01:04:04.689
Well, I know. I know.

01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:08.566
You know one night...

01:04:08.568 --> 01:04:10.276
my son went missing.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:13.112
He got in a big nark
and walked out of the room.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:14.905
We were watchingTop Gear.

01:04:14.907 --> 01:04:18.909
I told him to stop talking
over it. Off he went.

01:04:18.911 --> 01:04:22.413
Banged the door.
Then he never came back.

01:04:22.415 --> 01:04:24.832
State of panic.
Rang all his mates.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:28.419
I was driving round the streets
looking for him. Wife in tears.

01:04:28.421 --> 01:04:29.920
- You've no idea.
- Yes, I have.

01:04:29.922 --> 01:04:33.716
I'm driving round
and I am literally shaking.

01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:35.801
I call the station.
Got people on it. Didn't know

01:04:35.803 --> 01:04:39.972
what else to do. And then
I went up to his bedroom.

01:04:39.974 --> 01:04:41.432
- I know.
- No, no.

01:04:41.434 --> 01:04:43.645
I went up to his bedroom...

01:04:44.103 --> 01:04:46.063
and he were fast asleep.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.151
He'd gone straight to bed.

01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:51.903
There he was all cosy.

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.656
It happens.

01:04:57.242 --> 01:04:58.951
Not all the time.

- Jack's found him.
- What? He's here?

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.342
No. He's not here.

01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:59.719
He synced his phone
with my desktop.

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:05.518
He had "Find My Phone"
turned on. So, if I go here.

01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:08.186
That's him.

01:06:08.188 --> 01:06:10.022
That's where he is.

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:11.691
Where is that?

01:06:12.192 --> 01:06:15.153
Somewhere near Ainsdale.

01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:18.404
Well then,
he's fine then, isn't he?

01:06:18.406 --> 01:06:20.740
He's just gone to go
and get away from it all.

01:06:20.742 --> 01:06:23.909
That's where we used to go
on holiday when we were kids.

01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:25.995
What if he's gone
to meet someone?

01:06:25.997 --> 01:06:26.746
What?

01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:29.582
He talked about going to meet
some guy off the internet.

01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:31.751
He's not gone to meet
some guy off the internet.

01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:35.257
What's a guy off the internet
doing in Ainsdale?

01:06:35.548 --> 01:06:36.088
What?

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.924
That explains why he's not
answering his phone.

01:06:38.926 --> 01:06:40.887
He's got no signal.

01:06:41.471 --> 01:06:43.390
You don't even care.

01:06:44.474 --> 01:06:46.056
You don't even care
one little bit.

01:06:46.058 --> 01:06:47.267
Well, what do you want me to do?

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:50.730
He's gone on a jolly.
You just said.

01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:57.237
I know my dad better than you.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.573
And I know he's okay.

01:07:02.492 --> 01:07:04.952
But I'm going to go up there.

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.538
But I'm doing it for you.
Not him.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.999
Okay?

01:07:47.204 --> 01:07:48.705
"Nissom."

01:07:50.623 --> 01:07:52.124
What's that?

01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:55.378
It's just a nice word.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.839
I'm just...

01:07:59.882 --> 01:08:01.426
Favourite words.

01:08:07.599 --> 01:08:10.852
Do you know
what my favourite word is?

01:08:12.562 --> 01:08:14.314
No, I don't.

01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:17.609
Soap.

01:08:20.487 --> 01:08:21.946
Soap.

01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:26.073
Go on.

01:08:26.075 --> 01:08:27.785
Give it a go.

01:08:31.956 --> 01:08:33.291
Soap.

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:37.420
- Soap.
- Soap.

01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:44.636
Small pleasures, eh?

01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:28.513
Dad?

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:44.279
Alan?

01:11:28.508 --> 01:11:29.884
Alan!

01:11:37.934 --> 01:11:39.269
Alan!

01:11:49.279 --> 01:11:49.777
Dad!

01:11:49.779 --> 01:11:52.197
You broke his heart,
you know?

01:11:52.199 --> 01:11:54.449
All he ever talked about
was you.

01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:58.118
Doesn't matter
what conversational gambit

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.204
you try.

01:11:59.206 --> 01:12:01.916
The tides, the weather...

01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:05.293
European fishing quotas,
the sudden appearance

01:12:05.295 --> 01:12:07.795
of bottle nosed dolphins.

01:12:07.797 --> 01:12:11.924
The mating habits
of the North Atlantic grey seal.

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:16.262
It all comes back to you.
I, I wish he was here...

01:12:16.264 --> 01:12:17.847
I'm his other son.

01:12:17.849 --> 01:12:21.228
- What?
- The one who didn't run away.

01:12:22.187 --> 01:12:24.103
The one he's been staying with.

01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:28.318
The one he went to possibly
identify the body with.

01:12:29.444 --> 01:12:33.781
I've got a son, Jack.
He's quite close to my dad.

01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:36.407
- My wife Sue?
- No, mate.

01:12:36.409 --> 01:12:38.159
Well, we're a bit worried
about him. We were worried

01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:40.161
that he might have gone off
in a distracted state

01:12:40.163 --> 01:12:42.207
and done something you know...

01:12:42.665 --> 01:12:44.081
Hang on a minute.

01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:46.709
How do I know
that you're his son?

01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:50.546
How do I know that you're
not the tax. Or the police.

01:12:50.548 --> 01:12:51.964
Why would the police
be after him?

01:12:51.966 --> 01:12:55.220
I don't know.
He's an awkward bugger.

01:12:55.387 --> 01:12:56.093
He's my dad.

01:12:56.095 --> 01:13:00.267
We're worried about him.
Just tell me what you know.

01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:06.937
Yeah. Yeah. Now I see it.
You're the very image of him

01:13:06.939 --> 01:13:08.731
when you get narky.

01:13:08.733 --> 01:13:10.650
- He's out.
- I know he's out.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:11.984
That's why I'm worried
about him.

01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:15.155
Why you worried?
He's a very experienced sailor,

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.658
isn't he?

01:13:17.492 --> 01:13:19.825
- Is he?
- Yeah.

01:13:19.827 --> 01:13:21.411
Storms and gales,

01:13:21.413 --> 01:13:24.121
he's had the lot,
him and that little boat.

01:13:24.123 --> 01:13:27.752
Yeah. Very experienced.
Very experienced.

01:13:44.352 --> 01:13:46.271
What are you looking for?

01:13:47.522 --> 01:13:51.568
What have I been looking for
all these last years?

01:13:52.485 --> 01:13:56.948
When I put on my coat
and walk and walk and walk.

01:14:00.285 --> 01:14:03.120
What do you think
I was looking for?

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:09.877
I remember you doing it.

01:14:11.379 --> 01:14:14.799
But I didn't know
what you were doing at the time.

01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:17.885
I thought all dads did that,
you know.

01:14:21.138 --> 01:14:23.891
I didn't know where else
to look.

01:14:25.477 --> 01:14:27.437
Apart from everywhere.

01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:32.192
They tell you to think about...

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.861
everything you know about them.

01:14:38.365 --> 01:14:40.158
But it turns out...

01:14:43.453 --> 01:14:45.455
I didn't know that much.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.418
Only the Scrabble thing.

01:14:50.543 --> 01:14:53.085
And I don't even know
if he liked Scrabble

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:54.839
that much just...

01:14:55.632 --> 01:14:58.048
it stuck in my mind,
because he walked out

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.136
in the middle of a game.

01:15:02.096 --> 01:15:04.432
I should've gone after him.

01:15:08.102 --> 01:15:10.104
You were in a nark.

01:15:10.813 --> 01:15:12.940
I should have gone after him.

01:15:14.066 --> 01:15:17.111
That's true.
I never thought of that.

01:15:20.865 --> 01:15:23.535
I hate Scrabble.

01:15:25.162 --> 01:15:27.245
You think it's going to be
about the words

01:15:27.247 --> 01:15:29.582
but it's just about the numbers.

01:15:31.334 --> 01:15:34.252
You think you're going
to be playing lagoon

01:15:34.254 --> 01:15:36.005
and lambent...

01:15:37.465 --> 01:15:38.925
or soap...

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:44.055
but it's all Mu, Pi...

01:15:45.598 --> 01:15:47.265
Za and Zo.

01:15:47.267 --> 01:15:51.436
Nobody leaves home over a game
of Scrabble.

01:15:51.438 --> 01:15:54.023
It wasn't about the Scrabble.

01:15:55.775 --> 01:15:58.695
The Scrabble
was just the occasion.

01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:01.198
It was Mum.

01:16:02.699 --> 01:16:04.701
As soon as Mum died...

01:16:04.992 --> 01:16:07.912
he was just angry all the time.

01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:17.587
Something bad happened to him,

01:16:17.589 --> 01:16:20.130
when I should've been
protecting him.

01:16:20.132 --> 01:16:22.219
Dad, we don't know that.

01:16:25.722 --> 01:16:29.642
And then
this Skinny Thesaurus started.

01:16:29.892 --> 01:16:31.936
I mean, look at this.

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:36.314
He plays exactly
like our Michael.

01:16:36.316 --> 01:16:38.107
Same words sometimes.

01:16:38.109 --> 01:16:39.942
I've been playing him.

01:16:39.944 --> 01:16:40.860
I know I have.

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:44.324
He's found me.
Or I've found him.

01:16:44.616 --> 01:16:46.201
And if he is...

01:16:47.577 --> 01:16:51.038
you know,
I've been playing a ghost.

01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:53.914
All good players play
the same way.

01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:57.420
Yeah, until the other day,
and then, look.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:00.632
Look at this.

01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:03.341
Marauder. Down the side there.

01:17:03.343 --> 01:17:06.386
Would you waste a "u"
on a word like that?

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.888
Marauder is the name
of our caravan.

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.931
- He's trying to talk to me.
- Dad.

01:17:10.933 --> 01:17:12.475
- So I messaged him.
- Dad.

01:17:12.477 --> 01:17:13.476
I'm going to meet him.

01:17:13.478 --> 01:17:14.810
- Dad, don't do that.
- Look here,

01:17:14.812 --> 01:17:16.521
- there's the message.
- Everybody knows you shouldn't.

01:17:16.523 --> 01:17:18.231
Well, what have I got
to be scared of? The only thing

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:21.819
I'm scared of is dying
before I sort this out.

01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:51.803
Hello, son.

01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:00.853
Fancy a game?

01:20:09.362 --> 01:20:12.449
- Where did you get that?
- eBay.

01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:46.146
We've been playing each other
for weeks, haven't we?

01:20:46.148 --> 01:20:49.236
- What?
- You're him, aren't you?

01:20:49.527 --> 01:20:51.529
Skinny Thesaurus.

01:20:54.366 --> 01:20:55.783
I'm sorry.

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.533
I'm all there is.

01:20:57.535 --> 01:21:00.830
The PickwickTop of The Pops
of sons.

01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:02.205
It's all right.

01:21:02.207 --> 01:21:05.460
I'm the Chad Valley Big League
of Dads.

01:21:17.805 --> 01:21:20.558
This is bloody useless,
isn't it?

01:21:20.933 --> 01:21:22.433
The pieces are too flimsy.

01:21:22.435 --> 01:21:26.189
They get crumpled when you try
to pick them up, look...

01:21:26.398 --> 01:21:29.440
Well, that's all there is.
If you want to play then,

01:21:29.442 --> 01:21:30.150
that's it.

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:32.904
Have to make the best
of it then.

01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:41.746
Yeah.

01:21:43.706 --> 01:21:45.292
It's clearing up.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.167
Yeah. It's okay.

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:48.711
Nice day.

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:50.797
Well...

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.340
not nice but...

01:21:53.132 --> 01:21:54.551
ordinary.

01:21:59.306 --> 01:22:01.183
He's not coming back.

01:22:02.892 --> 01:22:04.519
The prodigal son.

01:22:06.145 --> 01:22:06.769
Not today.

01:22:06.771 --> 01:22:10.192
Give it a minute.
Traffic's terrible.

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.200
The other son...

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.033
the non-prodigal one.

01:22:21.035 --> 01:22:23.955
Do you know what he got
for his troubles?

01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:28.125
Days.

01:22:28.918 --> 01:22:30.378
Mornings.

01:22:31.671 --> 01:22:33.130
Afternoons.

01:22:34.507 --> 01:22:35.800
At home.

01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:38.511
With his family.

01:22:41.306 --> 01:22:43.891
Ordinary days like this one.

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:47.562
That's what he got.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.133
Oh.

01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:07.267
- All right?
- Yeah, you?

01:24:07.892 --> 01:24:08.849
Not bad.
