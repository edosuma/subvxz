[woman] Hey, Sally.
This is taking longer than I thought.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.573
-[horn blares]
-Can you jump on my schedule a bit more?

01:13.656 --> 01:16.076
I'm working my way through
the congresswoman's Christmas list,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.286
and I'm still two cashmere sweaters

01:18.369 --> 01:20.663
and a Tiffany bracelet
away from the bottom.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.959
I'm feeling less like a legislative aide
and more and more a personal shopper.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.336
It's a compliment, Erica.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.297
The congresswoman takes
her Christmas shopping very seriously.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.840
That's why she only trusts it to you.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.801
That's a positive spin.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.803
[Santa chuckles]

01:34.886 --> 01:37.597
Oh, I found that article you wanted.

[typing]

01:39.224 --> 01:40.308
What's a Christmas Drop?

01:40.391 --> 01:43.019
[Erica] It's some sort of mission
out of an airbase in the Pacific

01:43.103 --> 01:46.731
where they parachute gifts and supplies
to remote islands at Christmas.

01:46.815 --> 01:50.110
I am sending you a photo
of the headline page now.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.241
So who's Major Eye Candy
in the Santa cap?

01:56.324 --> 01:57.367
[phone alert]

02:00.912 --> 02:03.039
[chuckles] I have no idea.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.457
But ever since the congresswoman

02:04.541 --> 02:07.502
became head of the Base Realignment
and Closure Commission…

02:07.585 --> 02:08.545
[laughs]

Again?

Sorry, I lost you.
Indiana, are you guys there?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.144
-[buzzing]
-Yeah. No, the Wi-Fi's buffering again.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.980
Haskell, I thought we agreed
to upgrade our bandwidth.

03:09.063 --> 03:09.898
We did.

03:09.981 --> 03:13.109
But since you had me put the router
in the barn so you could FaceTime the vet,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.652
the signal's too weak.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.613
Let's just reboot the modem.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.407
-No! Then we'll lose Andrew. No! Haskell!
-[sighs]

03:19.490 --> 03:22.952
And so ends our family's attempt
at Christmas caroling via web.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.662
Ah, that's okay, sis.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.623
Watching Mom and Dad bicker about Wi-Fi

03:26.706 --> 03:28.917
reminds me of Christmas
more than you know.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.587
How's your Christmas over there,
Uncle Andrew?

03:33.087 --> 03:35.089
Well, you heard of a partridge
in a pear tree?

03:35.673 --> 03:37.592
I got a seagull in a coconut palm.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.553
Maybe you could borrow an Air Force jet
and fly home.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.931
-It's only eight days till Christmas.
-[laughs]

03:43.014 --> 03:44.891
I wish I could, kiddo,
but they need me here.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.018
We got a big job helping Santa out.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.063
I know. Mom told me.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.483
I just wish you were here for Christmas.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.152
Me, too, pumpkin.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.445
Me, too.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.708
[man 1] Man, I really miss home
this time of year.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.045
[man 2] Look, man, I'm telling you,
nothing beats Christmas in Wisconsin.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.048
Ice skating, ice fishing,
snowmobiling through the trees.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.133
-Winter there is the best season there is.
-[laughs]

04:19.217 --> 04:21.261
Yeah, Wisconsin's got all the seasons,
all right.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.555
It's got winter, still winter,
more winter, mud, and then winter again.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.808
[Andrew laughs]
Repeatin' the same joke each day

04:26.891 --> 04:28.935
-doesn't make it any funnier, eh, Joker?
-Hah!

04:29.018 --> 04:31.479
Look, I just thought adding in
the extra "winter"

04:31.562 --> 04:34.148
-would give it more life, you know?
-'Cause it had life?

04:34.232 --> 04:37.568
[Joker] The joke is Wisconsin's
got nothing on Arizona.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.571
And, man, do I miss
my momma's eggnog pumpkin pie.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.411
What about you, Sunshine?
Miss anything? Anyone?

04:47.662 --> 04:48.955
I really miss Cam.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.416
My '67 Camaro.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.419
-[laughs]
-In my garage, gatherin' dust.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.214
Well, we all wanna be home this time of
year, but, uh, we got the next best thing.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.216
Need your signature, Captain.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.220
[sighs] Are you gonna be on base
for Christmas, Airman?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.763
Afraid so, sir.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.473
Well, we got the Drop coming up.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.934
The typhoon last month
ripped the roof off of our warehouse,

05:10.018 --> 05:12.562
and we lost most of our donations,
so we're still playing catch-up.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.814
-We could use as much help as we can get.
-I'm signed up.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.024
Well done.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.276
We got a fundraiser
coming up this weekend.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.029
It's gonna be lots of good music,
good people, holiday cheer.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.448
And dancing. Lots and lots of dancing.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.532

05:24.615 --> 05:26.242
I'm a world-class dancer, Sunshine.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.912
You know, there might be enough room
for me to show you all my moves.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.665
-Not gonna happen.
-[soldier laughs]

05:32.749 --> 05:35.543
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna miss
Joker's world-class dancing.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.128
[Andrew] It's for the best cause, so…

05:37.211 --> 05:39.505
Yeah, that's just one part
of the captain's personal mission

05:39.589 --> 05:42.842
to make sure that nobody in this base
misses the holiday season.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.635
[Andrew] If we can't be home
for Christmas…

05:46.304 --> 05:48.765

meeting ended at three a.m., okay?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.407
The congresswoman was tired and misspoke.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.743
How about you quote someone else
for your article,

06:08.826 --> 06:14.624
and maybe I can find an invite for you
for the French embassy's New Year's party?

06:16.042 --> 06:19.545
Yes. With a plus one. Great.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.131
You're magic.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.674
I think this legislative-aide thing

06:23.758 --> 06:26.177
may put your personal shopping career
on the back burner.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.055
And that's why you're a shoo-in
to be the next chief of staff.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.641
Last I checked, we already have one.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.103
Not for long. I hear that lobbying group
just upped Sheila's offer.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.146
-Seriously?
-Mm-hm.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.981
…cowboys, cowboys…

06:39.065 --> 06:40.233
No. There's… [sighs]

06:40.316 --> 06:43.444
…others way ahead of me
in line for that, like Matt.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.904
How do I compete with a guy

06:44.987 --> 06:48.032

Bradford's Bat-Signal.

-It's all emojis. She's in trouble.
-Mm.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.707
I got this.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.216
[woman] Well, it's…
it's quite a lot of detail to take in.

07:05.299 --> 07:08.344
Excuse me, congresswoman.
You're wanted on an urgent matter.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.763
-National security.
-Mm.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.098
-Excuse us.
-Mm.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.934
Ah, that was perfect timing.

07:15.017 --> 07:19.522
Remind me not to have discussions
with snow sculpture enthusiasts again.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.982
I'll add it to the list, ma'am.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.443
Okay. You have 40 minutes

07:23.526 --> 07:26.154
before your meeting with General Mason
about the closure proposals.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.530
-[Bradford] That's today?
-Mm-hm.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.491
[Bradford] Where are you with the research
on that air base in the Pacific?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.286
Andersen is the base.
I'm pulling together some info.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.207
"Operation Christmas Drop."

07:38.291 --> 07:39.959
They've been using
our military cargo planes

07:40.042 --> 07:43.379
to drop gifts and supplies
to remote islands at Christmas.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.424
If we're looking to close down bases,
this one's flashing red and green.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.676
They're calling it
a low altitude training exercise.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.845
That just happens
to be dropping Christmas presents.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.972
Yes, but I'm sure
there's more to it than that.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.975
Well, then, find out.
I'm gonna send you over there.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.936
You can assess their operations,
suggest cuts,

07:59.020 --> 08:01.481
or, better yet,
make a case for base closure.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.398
You're sending me?

08:02.482 --> 08:06.152
I need your investigative prowess
to turn over every stone on that island.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.072
You know, January in the tropics
doesn't sound so bad.

08:10.156 --> 08:14.827
Says here this Drop thing is in a week.
You need to be there before it happens.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.622
Boots on the ground, Miller.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.081
[Bradford walking away]

08:19.165 --> 08:21.000
Kind of had plans for Christmas.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.710
[phone ringing]

08:22.793 --> 08:24.378
[sighing] Hey, Dad.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.299
I guess, by the look on your face,
you got my message.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.801
[Dad] Honey, what assignment
is so important

08:30.885 --> 08:33.638
you have to cancel Christmas
with your family this time?

08:33.721 --> 08:36.432
Look, I know you're disappointed,
but I can't get out of it.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.561
[sighs] Carol and I were really
looking forward to seeing you this year.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.479
I know, Dad.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.898
But it's a chief of staff job opening,

08:43.981 --> 08:46.150
and this might be
a real game-changer for me.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.905
Are you sure
that's really the reason, sweetheart?

08:50.988 --> 08:52.198
What else would it be?

08:53.407 --> 08:56.827
You haven't been here for Christmas
since your mom passed away, Eri.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.248
If you could just give Carol a chance,
I think you two could be friends.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.041
It's not Carol, Dad.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.962
Look, maybe there's a way that I can…

09:06.879 --> 09:08.631
come for your birthday, maybe.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.591
Another "maybe."

09:11.968 --> 09:13.511
Well, that's the best I got, Dad.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.181
Be safe. I love you.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.476
Okay. I love you.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.520
[sighs]

09:25.189 --> 09:26.482
[sighs]

09:29.110 --> 09:30.111
I know, Mom.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.196
I'm trying.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.205
-[Andrew] Permission to enter, sir?
-Enter.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.671
At ease, Andrew.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.382
-You asked to see me, sir?
-I did.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.927
I got off the phone with the head of
the Armed Services Committee this morning.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.805
Word is, we're on the short list
for realignment or closure.

09:57.888 --> 09:58.723
Seriously, sir?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.433
They make a final decision in a few weeks,

10:00.516 --> 10:02.643
but a friend on the Hill got a message
to me saying

10:02.727 --> 10:04.729
we've got a target on our backs.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.982
But, sir, we're the most strategically
important location in the South Pacific.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.901
Maybe, but this didn't help.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.447
For some reason,
this has grabbed Washington's attention,

10:14.530 --> 10:15.990
and now we're in their crosshairs.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.367
-And I need you to get us out of it.
-Me, sir?

10:18.451 --> 10:22.955
There's a congressional aide flying in
from DC to evaluate base operations.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.541
I need someone to show 'em around,
put our best foot forward.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.793
But, sir, I'm a cargo pilot.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.046
You've also got
mad people skills, Captain.

10:30.129 --> 10:33.090
And there isn't anyone on this base
I would trust more to pull this off.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.802
Sir, I really think you'd be better off
with one of the base PAOs.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.720
You know, the--

10:37.803 --> 10:41.265
If I put a Public Affairs Officer on this,
it would make it official, Andrew.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.017
We're not supposed
to know about this yet.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.061
We got nothin' to hide.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.814
Exactly, which is why I want you
to make sure this bean-counter sees

10:48.898 --> 10:51.192
we are 100% mission-focused on this base.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.236
The flight from DC lands
at 0900 tomorrow.

10:56.155 --> 10:56.989
That is all.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.241
Understood, sir.

11:19.929 --> 11:20.930
Hi!

11:21.847 --> 11:23.516
[Erica] Those look dangerous.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.185
Unexploded ordnance?

11:27.561 --> 11:28.688
-Used to be.
-Uh-huh.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.232
Now we just use it
to keep tourists off our break.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.236
Aren't you a little overdressed
for the beach?

11:35.319 --> 11:37.822
Aren't you a little underdressed
for an officer?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.533
Off duty…

11:40.616 --> 11:42.159
for eight more minutes.

11:43.911 --> 11:47.123
If you're lost,
the resort is back that way two clicks.

11:47.206 --> 11:51.460
I'm not lost. Just wanna stretch my legs.
It was a pretty long flight.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.672
-Long flight?
-Yeah, 36 hours from DC.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.634
Washington?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.263
Washington, DC.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.433
I think I'm your ride.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.560
Huh.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.899
[Andrew] Seriously, General Hatcher said
your flight lands at 0900.

12:14.734 --> 12:19.155
I switched planes in Pearl
and shaved two hours off of my trip.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.116
In my line of work,
I look for ways to improve efficiency.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.619
And what brainiac
steered you down to the beach?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.538
Oh, the same one
that tried your cell five times

12:27.621 --> 12:29.248
while you were out playing in the water.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.377
Oh.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.963
So it was one of the smart brainiacs.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.090
-Is this military issue?
-Nope.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.677
It's my Jeep. I wouldn't use
a military-issue vehicle for personal use.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.804
By the way, the name's Andrew.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.056
Oh, I know. I recognize you.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.143
From that Stars and Stripes article

12:49.226 --> 12:51.937
about cargo pilots providing
just-in-time combat support?

12:52.021 --> 12:56.358
[laughs] No, from the ukulele Santa photo
in the newspaper.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.028
No offense, ma'am, but you don't know
the first thing about me.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.530
Captain Andrew Jantz,

13:01.614 --> 13:06.619
interim commander on G-Series orders
for the 734th Air Mobility Squadron.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.788
You've been a cargo pilot for nine years.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.166
You graduated UCLA ROTC with high honors

13:12.249 --> 13:15.044
and a reprimand for a prank
involving the colonel's car…

13:15.878 --> 13:17.004
and a possum.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.716
Well, maybe I know a little bit
about you, too.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.301
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.805
By that accent,
I'd say you hail from Philadelphia.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.350
That key chain on your tote bag says
you went to Georgetown.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.561
And by the way you like to call the shots,
you headed your college sorority.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.438
Impressive.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.733
Wildly inaccurate.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.111
The accent is from Boston,
but I went to UPenn

13:41.195 --> 13:43.989
and lost most of it
in a Delaware Valley dialect.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.284
And the key chain on my tote
is from Georgetown, but it was a gift

13:47.368 --> 13:51.163
from the Georgetown School
of Foreign Service conference in Qatar.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.124
[man on radio] Hey, Claws.
You, uh, got that bean-counter yet?

13:54.750 --> 13:55.751
"Claus"?

13:57.461 --> 14:00.840
Around here, I'm not Andrew.
I'm Claws. C-L-A-W-S.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.425
It's an aircrew tradition
to address each other with call signs.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.178
I would have thought "Claus" as in Santa
would have made more sense.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.722
One picture in a Santa hat
isn't enough to earn a call sign.

14:08.806 --> 14:14.603
Okay, Claws, why did your general
pick you to fly my Jeep this week?

14:15.312 --> 14:16.605
Must be his great sense of humor.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.692
And your boss sending you here
a week before Christmas?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.278
Duty calls.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.321
You won't find any inefficiencies.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.700
I'd like to see things for myself,
just the same.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.328
Now I understand.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.330
Understand what?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.915
Why your boss sent you here.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.502
So you wouldn't spoil
the office Christmas party.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.546
Just drive.

14:59.565 --> 15:04.153
[Andrew] You'll be staying here. [sighs]
Base housing for short-term guests.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.573
You've been up all night.
How about you get some shut-eye?

15:07.656 --> 15:11.201
-I'll pick you up later this afternoon.
-Oh, no. We're starting in 30 minutes.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.913
[Andrew] That didn't sound
like a question.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.542
Yeah, well, I need to change my shoes
and answer e-mails.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.960
And then I wanna tour the base.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.338
I need to interview staff,
review purchase orders.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.548
Basic fact-finding mission.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.261
-What do you intend to find?
-[rattling]

15:30.763 --> 15:33.349
Probably more
than you feel comfortable sharing.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.070
Sorry it's not the Ritz. [sighs]

15:46.153 --> 15:48.489
But if you see a gecko,
remember they're good luck.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.199
Don't worry.
When you work on Capitol Hill,

15:50.282 --> 15:53.118
you're used to all sorts of odd creatures.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.955
Copy that. See you in 30.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.333
Oh, and, Captain,
can you get me a map of the island,

15:59.416 --> 16:02.044
a command org chart,
and a base acquisition forecast?

16:03.170 --> 16:06.215
Would you also like turndown service
and mints on your pillow, too, ma'am?

16:07.257 --> 16:11.261
The general told me you were here
to assist me in any way that I needed.

16:12.596 --> 16:16.183
[sighs] Map, org chart,
and acquisition forecast. Roger that.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.267
Perfect.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.480
You're gonna fit in great around here.
Clearly, you like giving orders.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.440
See you in a half.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.830
The bean-counter has landed.

16:37.913 --> 16:43.168
And she is the most high-maintenance,
condescending pencil pusher I've ever met.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.503
-She, sir?
-Is she single?

16:44.586 --> 16:46.797
-Is she gonna be trouble?
-[Andrew] Not if I can help it.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.924
I'm just going to give her the grand tour,

16:49.008 --> 16:52.886
let the island work its magic, and
she will be out of our hair in no time.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.972
-[rattling]
-[Erica grunting]

16:55.681 --> 16:56.932
[sighs]

16:57.808 --> 16:59.393
-[rattling continues]
-[grunts]

17:01.854 --> 17:02.855
[gasps] Oh!

17:04.231 --> 17:08.360
Luck? Why don't you go spread your luck
outside or something, hm?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.154
Come on.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.865
Come on.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.659
Shoo, shoo. Come on.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.165
[sighs]

17:23.792 --> 17:25.044
No? Okay.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.047
It's freakin' me out.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.674
[sighs] Okay.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.386
[device ringing]

17:38.057 --> 17:39.933
-[computer chimes]
-Hey.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.270
Aloha! [sighs]
How's paradise treating you?

17:43.353 --> 17:44.980
It's not aloha here, Sal.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.274
That is Hawaii. Here, they say hafa adai.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.026
And, as for paradise,

17:49.902 --> 17:53.322
there is a gecko that is giving me
the evil eye as we speak.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.239
What's up?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.534
The boss wanted me to check in,
make sure you got there in one piece.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.078
Is it hot? It looks hot.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.788
It is so hot.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.749
I started into it.
They assigned me a handler.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.377
He's got a huge ego,
but nothing I can't handle.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.921
Is he a pilot?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.006
Why? 'Cause pilots have big egos?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.967
But that's okay,
because, you know, they're pilots.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.844
Good thing the door was open.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.430
I don't think my huge ego
would fit through the window.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.974
Uh… gotta go! Hafa adai.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.020
-Don't people knock around here?
-The door was open.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.106
Yeah, I'm trying to get rid of this gecko.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.733
Don't wanna do that.
I told you, they're lucky…

18:30.943 --> 18:33.445
and the best insect repellent
you're gonna find. [sighs]

18:33.987 --> 18:35.155
[Erica] Uhhh…

18:36.073 --> 18:38.659
All right. Let's get started.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.455
Your air conditioner is broken.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.667
Let's go.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.881
[Andrew] This base is home to the 36th
Wing in the 734th Air Mobility Squadron.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.260
Bombers and heavy transport as well
as fighter groups like these F-15s here

18:56.343 --> 18:57.678
rotate through on a regular basis.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.346
We have operations all around the island.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.266
See, despite the impression that
the article gave, there is no slack here.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.434
Everybody is busy with very serious work.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.062
[bells jingling]

19:09.815 --> 19:11.400
Are those Christmas ornaments?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.277
Ornaments and gifts
for our local school kids.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.653
Part of our community outreach.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.823
We'll head to Acquisitions,
and then we'll go to the tower. Come on.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.910
[Erica] Okay. I am going to skim this one.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.246
Hm…

19:25.455 --> 19:27.040
Um… This one.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.667
Let's see.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.380
You know, I've got all the info
on a portable hard drive.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.048
[Erica] This one…

19:35.132 --> 19:36.967
Actually, no, the binders work fine.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.263
Yep. This one.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.103
[jet engine roars overhead]

19:51.481 --> 19:54.193
The elevator's being serviced,
but you can leave your stuff

19:54.276 --> 19:57.404
at the base of the stairs,
or I'm happy to carry it up for you.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.532
[scoffs] I'm good. Thanks.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.494
[helicopter approaching]

20:08.749 --> 20:11.960
[Andrew] This is the tallest tower
in all the Pacific Air Forces.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.795
Sixteen stories.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.798
Originally built in the '60s.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.596
Hey, guys, we have a visitor.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.057
[Erica grunts]

20:25.140 --> 20:26.725
Sergeant, finish that doughnut.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.060
[radio chatter]

20:28.143 --> 20:29.853
See? Nothing goes to waste here.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.689
-Quite a view.
-It is, ma'am.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.275
[radio chatter continues]

20:36.151 --> 20:39.988
Yeah, I, uh… want to come up
and see it at night, though.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.158
I was leafing
through your purchase orders,

20:43.242 --> 20:47.162
and I noticed an order
for red and green… landing lights.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.916
Lights can be handy
if you wanna land a plane at night.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.753
-Got an answer for everything.
-'Cause I'm efficient.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.505
Up next, Detachment Two,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.924
the 21st Space Operations Squadron.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.384
[sighs] Do we have to walk?

21:01.468 --> 21:03.303
[Andrew] You know,
when you visit our island,

21:03.387 --> 21:07.099
it's considered bad luck
not to visit all five of our beaches.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.768
That line work with all the girls?

21:10.352 --> 21:12.396
Look, Captain,
I appreciate the guided tour,

21:12.479 --> 21:14.398
but I'd like to stay focused
on base resources.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.957
Like I said, we got operations
all over the island.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.709
[music blaring from truck]

21:37.546 --> 21:40.007
What's at Tarague Beach?

21:40.090 --> 21:42.342
Oh, it's just a… big swamp.

21:42.426 --> 21:46.722
Lot of military assets
heading toward a… big swamp.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.890
Yes, they must be doing
some sort of survival training.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.477
Next up, the largest outdoor market
on the island.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.149
-[laughter and conversation]
-[woman] Yeah. Oh, yeah.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.402
How much is this?

22:00.485 --> 22:02.696
You don't like this one? Okay.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.615
Thank you! Hi. How are you? Hey!

22:08.452 --> 22:11.705
-Hi, Andrew.
-Hi, Noelia. Hey, guys.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.749
This is all really nice, but, uh…

22:14.374 --> 22:16.460
I came here to observe and report,

22:16.543 --> 22:19.838
not, uh, work on my tan
and taste the local fare, okay?

22:19.921 --> 22:22.049
[machine whirring]

22:23.425 --> 22:25.302
-Hafa adai, Sue.
-Hey, Andrew.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.887
-How you doin'?
-Good. How are you?

22:26.970 --> 22:29.389
-I'm good. Could I grab two, please?
-Sure.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.225
Oh, by the way,
our church's canned food drive was huge.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.394
We've got five crates of food
for the Drop.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.937
-[Andrew] That's awesome!
-[Sue] Yeah!

22:36.021 --> 22:37.981
-[Andrew] I'll see you on packing day.
-[Sue] Yeah.

22:38.482 --> 22:42.444
Coconut Christmas. This Saturday.
What's that about?

22:43.111 --> 22:44.571
Probably just some local thing.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.241
-Straw.
-[man] See you Saturday night, Andrew.

22:50.744 --> 22:54.456
Yeah… How do you like that?
Christmas colors.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.833
It's hard to remember it's Christmas
when it's this hot.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.045
Actually, will you excuse me
for a second? Be right back.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.713
-[woman laughs]
-[man] Right?

23:03.382 --> 23:06.259
Hey, Mr. Mayor. Sorry to interrupt.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.803
How are you doin', sir?

23:08.303 --> 23:11.306
Let me guess, Cap'n.
You want me to donate another generator?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.600
The typhoon kicked the crap
out of the atolls.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.602
Generators are their source of power.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.688
We have no way of communicating with them
if they can't use their ham radios.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.607
I get it. I feel for them.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.235
But I'm not in the business
of giving away generators for free.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.153
They cost far too much.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.155
If you don't mind,
I'm in the middle of something.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.285
-Who was that?
-[sighs]

23:32.369 --> 23:34.538
That is Mayor Sampson.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.957
He's probably one of the richest men
on the island.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.584
And the one with the least amount
of Christmas spirit.

23:40.460 --> 23:44.381
Someone should invite him to the Coconut
Christmas on Saturday and remind him.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.091
That's actually a good idea.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.136
I'll talk to some of the locals about it
who are putting on this local event.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.479
[Erica] It's getting late here.
Is this even a road?

23:59.563 --> 24:00.897
[Andrew] Quick detour…

24:00.981 --> 24:04.109
to the most sensational turquoise beach
you'll ever set your eyes on.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.278
Maybe run down the clock
till I head home?

24:06.361 --> 24:10.031
I am offended you even think
I would stoop so low.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.871
You know what, Captain?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.498
Maybe you're right.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.125
-I am?
-Eh…

24:20.792 --> 24:22.502
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.504
Great!

24:25.338 --> 24:26.423
To the beach!

24:27.549 --> 24:28.884
To the beach.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.810
-[Andrew] Nice, huh?
-[birdsong]

24:38.894 --> 24:42.731
-I told you it's beautiful.
-Beautiful? Oh, it's amazing.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.650
[both sigh]

24:47.360 --> 24:48.570
[Erica] Wow.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.365
[sighs]

24:52.449 --> 24:53.783
Aaah!

24:54.701 --> 24:55.911
Nothin' beats this view.

24:56.912 --> 25:00.081
Man, I have to send a selfie to my dad.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.084
-Oh-- [sighs]
-[Andrew] Left your phone in the Jeep?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.127
-I did.
-I can go get it.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.295
[Erica] I got it. I got it.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.214
I got it.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.760
[jet engine roars overhead]

25:12.469 --> 25:13.845
-[seabird calling]
-[sighs]

25:17.474 --> 25:18.808
[Jeep door slams]

25:19.893 --> 25:21.061
[engine starts]

25:21.144 --> 25:22.187
Hey!

25:24.564 --> 25:25.815
Enjoy the view.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.109
[panting]

25:30.237 --> 25:32.322
[chuckles and sighs]

25:32.906 --> 25:33.823
Okay.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.620
[panting]

25:38.703 --> 25:40.163
[laughter]

25:40.247 --> 25:41.248
[Andrew] Shut up!

25:42.290 --> 25:44.501
Figured you'd come back through the trees.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.545
-She left your Jeep for you.
-Where is she?

25:46.628 --> 25:48.171
-[panting]
-Where isn't she?

25:48.255 --> 25:52.592
Air Ops, Supply, Wing HQ, Com Squadron.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.096
Oh, man! This assignment's gonna be harder
than I thought.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.514
[laughing]

26:04.479 --> 26:06.481
[low music and conversation]

26:11.861 --> 26:13.989
-[Joker] Cap'n.
-Where's your shadow, Captain?

26:14.698 --> 26:17.450
She went rogue, but it's under control.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.203
Claws to Andersen Tower.
You guys got eyes on Blitzen?

26:21.079 --> 26:22.163
[man] Claws, Andersen Tower.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.833
Blitzen last seen outside Air Mobility,
Hangar Three.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.209
Oh, no.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.546
[Erica] Blitzen?

26:31.006 --> 26:32.340
-Really, Captain?
-[sighs]

26:32.424 --> 26:34.426
I pitched for "Grinch,"
but nobody went for it.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.762
Hi. We were just, uh, talkin' about you.
How'd you find me?

26:37.846 --> 26:40.390
Left my phone in your Jeep
and tracked you here.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.643
Figured the first place you'd go
is the last place you'd want me to see.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.812
Damn, she's good.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.649
So, Air Force base
or Claws' little village?

26:50.650 --> 26:52.193
-I can explain.
-Good.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.654
You can start by explaining
what is going on at Tarague Beach.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.742
I drove by there,
and instead of finding survival training,

26:58.825 --> 27:01.536
I found Christmas decorations
and party supplies.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.497
Time to lay your Christmas cards
on the table, Captain.

27:10.587 --> 27:15.008
Okay, that stuff you saw at the beach
is for Saturday night.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.844
And all of this
is for Operation Christmas Drop.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.013
Yeah, I know.
It's one of the reasons I'm here.

27:20.096 --> 27:23.099
You might know it's a tradition
that goes back almost 70 years.

27:24.267 --> 27:27.520
Last year, we delivered medicine, food,
toys, and gifts

27:27.604 --> 27:30.106
to almost 30,000 people,
56 different islands.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.733
And we plan to do more this year.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.152
I'm sure it's a good cause,
but not on the taxpayers' dime.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.863
That's just it.
Taxpayers don't pay a cent!

27:36.946 --> 27:39.824
-I find that hard to believe.
-It's funded entirely by donation.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.993
Almost all of it from people
here on the island.

27:42.077 --> 27:45.664
Individuals, businesses, church groups
all year long are donating.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.208
Clothes, food, medicine, supplies,

27:48.291 --> 27:49.876
fishing nets, everything you see here.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.128
But what about the military personnel
that it takes?

27:52.212 --> 27:55.256
Everyone is working on their off hours.
That's how much it means to them.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.593
Okay. What about the fuel?
The wear and tear on the aircraft?

27:59.219 --> 28:03.014
[Andrew] The Drop is probably the best
low-altitude training these crews get.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.974
We'd be flying these planes
to train anyways.

28:05.058 --> 28:08.103
At least, with the Drop,
we're doing something good while we fly.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.523
Plus, we get to work with our allies.
The Japanese, the Australians.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.819
Most importantly, it's Christmas.

28:16.611 --> 28:19.698
A lot of the people we help live on some
of the most remote islands in the world.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.200
If it wasn't for us and the work we do,
they'd be on their own.

28:22.283 --> 28:23.493
I'm not the Grinch.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.370
I get it.

28:26.329 --> 28:29.833
It's a good cause. It's good training.
I see the benefits.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.376
But I have an assignment,

28:32.460 --> 28:35.380
and, cost aside, I don't see how
this helps the functioning of the base.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.464
[sighs]

28:40.927 --> 28:44.305
For a lot of the enlisted kids here, this
is their first Christmas away from home.

28:45.515 --> 28:48.935
With the Drop, they feel like they're
doing something important. Helping people.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.687
I'll be sure to mention it all
in my report.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.147
Yeah, I bet.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.315
What is that supposed to mean?

28:54.399 --> 28:57.068
I think you had your mind made up
before you stepped off the plane.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.822
Look, Captain, I'm not gonna tell
the congresswoman to take it easy

29:00.905 --> 29:02.782
because you have a big heart
and a nice smile.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.661
So you admit I have a nice smile?

29:07.954 --> 29:10.123
Look, we're a family here.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.584
And what you say about us could lead
to the base closing.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.669
-We've heard the rumors.
-I don't make the decision.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.670
I just write a report.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.630
A report you've been told
needs to be damning

29:17.714 --> 29:20.008
to get to a result
some congresswoman needs to fill a quota.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.176
That's not true.

29:23.219 --> 29:26.055
Give me 24 hours to show you
what we do here, starting with the Drop.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.141
Then write whatever you want
in your report.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.268
Captain, this isn't a negotiation.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.228
Everything's a negotiation, Erica.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.814
I need you to see what we do here.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.484
Then at least you'll be writing the truth.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.070
-[man 1] Packing tape.
-[man 2] Packing tape…

29:41.613 --> 29:43.072
[man 1] Well, hold onto that tape.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.159
[cicadas chirping]

29:58.630 --> 30:00.340
[sighs]

30:01.090 --> 30:03.218
-Hi, I'm--
-Erica.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.177
-Yeah.
-Yes, of course.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.929
-I'm Sandra. Come on in.
-Thanks.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.475
So kind of you to invite me,
and totally unnecessary.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.018
You're far from home at Christmas.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.103
The least we could do is
give you a home-cooked meal.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.105
Thank you. I like your place.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.359
Thanks. When we first moved in,
it was a little cinder-block chic.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.444
Built to withstand typhoons
and good taste.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.155
But I've managed to nudge it
in the right direction.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.073
Are you a decorator?

30:26.199 --> 30:28.326
No, actually, I'm the OSS Commander.

30:29.035 --> 30:29.869
That would make you--

30:29.953 --> 30:32.121
Lieutenant Colonel Blaine,
your 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.164
-Yeah.
-[laughs] Okay!

30:33.248 --> 30:35.875
I had no idea
that you and the general were married.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.085
Dinner's ready!

30:37.168 --> 30:39.254
Well, tonight, he is not the general.
He's the chef.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.549
And he will not tolerate it if we eat
cold food, so please take a seat.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.217
Okay. Wow!

30:45.134 --> 30:46.594
This is wonderful.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.805
[Sandra] Yeah.
Not only a superb Wing Commander

30:48.888 --> 30:52.100
but also a true epicurean
when it comes to holiday meals.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.977
I'd ask you to carve, Ms. Miller,

30:54.060 --> 30:56.729
but I'm hoping to avoid
you making any unnecessary cuts.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.315
-Hatch!
-[laughs] It's okay, ma'am.

30:59.399 --> 31:03.361
I'm just here to write a report, General.
My boss is the one making the decisions.

31:03.486 --> 31:06.447
And has Captain Jantz been effectively
facilitating your report?

31:06.531 --> 31:09.200
Yes, very effective
in steering me in the wrong direction.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.411
But that'll only help me
find the right one.

31:12.912 --> 31:13.997
Cheers.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.249
Cheers.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.132
[Erica] Thank you.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.301
Sandra, that was great.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.261
Are you sure I can't give you a ride?

31:28.344 --> 31:30.263
Oh, it's such a beautiful night
for a walk.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.975
And the sooner I get back to my room,
the sooner I have to get back to work.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.185
-Your report.
-My report.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.606
A lot of people's livelihoods are resting
on your shoulders right now, Erica.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.901
I'm painfully aware of that, ma'am, but,
as I said, I don't make the decisions.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.570
Well, yeah, you do. Don't fool yourself.

31:45.653 --> 31:49.198
Everything that you decide to write
in that report will directly impact

31:49.282 --> 31:50.950
the lives of everyone on this base.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.995
While you're here,
you need to meet all these people.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.748
You need to see all the great work
that they're doing.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.626
Lieutenant Colonel,
you know as well as I do

31:59.709 --> 32:02.921
that, sometimes, hard decisions
have to be made for the greater good.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.673
As painful as they might be.
I tried to tell Andrew that.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.470
Just so you know…
I mean, Andrew is impossible.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.765
But he's the most honorable guy
you'll ever meet.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.351
-Oh, really?
-He's a good person to show you around.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.811
And I really hope
that you see everything.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.565
Thank you. Well, have a good night.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.524
Good night, Erica.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.784
[sighs]

32:34.577 --> 32:35.954
[horns blaring]

32:37.914 --> 32:39.958
See? We got three inches today.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.336
They're predicting it'll be
the whitest Christmas in 30 years.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.881
-Ah, makes me feel so Christmassy.
-[Erica] Oh, I wish I was there.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.841
Are you crazy? You're in paradise.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.970
You sound like the pilot
they assigned to show me around here.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.180
He's trying to get me to see
how beautiful the island is

32:54.263 --> 32:56.516
instead of concentrating on the base.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.394
Erica, promise me
you will try to have some fun.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.895
You're on a tropical island.

33:01.896 --> 33:02.772
Progress?

33:04.315 --> 33:07.026
Yes, I, am… actually…

33:07.568 --> 33:11.781
currently going through thousands of pages
of expenditure reports right now, ma'am.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.449
[Bradford] Well, forget about that.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.161
Matt and his group are working
on the base's file plan here.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.540
It's all available on the DOD server.
I'm surprised you didn't know about that.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.499
[tuts]

33:21.582 --> 33:23.501
This is all they offered up.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.004
I need you on your A game, Erica.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.338
I'm being pushed to come up

33:27.422 --> 33:30.425
with comprehensive shutter arguments
for three bases.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.594
Two of them are easy.
One of them is in my district.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.139
I need a replacement,
and that's going to be your base

33:36.222 --> 33:39.058
with its yearly Christmas present toss.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.894
Actually, they're not dropping presents.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.397
It's a remarkable humanitarian mission

33:44.480 --> 33:46.566
that's helping
tens of thousands of people.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.485
I'm sorry to sound harsh here,
but using military equipment

33:49.569 --> 33:52.613
to drop Christmas presents in the middle
of nowhere can't be justified.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.949
That's just it.
That's not what's happening here, ma'am.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.661
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the headline of your report.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.706
Don't drink their Kool-Aid, Erica.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.499
[dialing tone]

34:17.138 --> 34:19.140
[crickets chirping]

34:19.891 --> 34:22.268
[jet flying in distance]

34:27.648 --> 34:29.567
-[knocking]
-All right, I'm here.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.235
As promised.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.945
[Andrew] Great. Ready in a sec.

34:34.864 --> 34:35.823
[Erica] Oh.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.409
Love what you've done with the place.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.453
Don't knock it.

34:40.953 --> 34:45.875
Cardboard is surprisingly strong
and unexpectedly stylish.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.753
Yeah, unexpectedly.

34:50.171 --> 34:53.424
These boxes will all be gone
in a couple of days. [sighs]

34:54.884 --> 34:57.345
-What are you doing here?
-What?

34:57.428 --> 34:59.430
I can't imagine
other captains live like this.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.099
I like it here.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.768
-I get to sort stuff on my free time.
-[jet flies overhead]

35:03.851 --> 35:05.353
I don't need much furniture.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.189
Anyway, you ready for our trip?

35:08.689 --> 35:09.524
Sure.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.860
[sighs] What'd you have in mind?

35:14.278 --> 35:16.572
[Erica shouts] I thought you said
we were running an errand!

35:16.656 --> 35:17.490
[Andrew] We are.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.159
[Erica] Could've sworn
you didn't used the word "helicopter."

35:20.243 --> 35:21.744
[Andrew] 'Cause I knew you'd never go.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.872
Man, what a day for flyin'.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.667
[Erica] Or crashing into the sea, maybe.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.168
I wouldn't worry about that.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.547
We have the Navy to thank
for letting us hitch a ride.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.590
They have all the rotary assets
around here,

35:34.674 --> 35:36.134
so we gotta be extra nice to them.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.178
Go Navy! Beat Army!

35:46.519 --> 35:48.646
It's so awesome up here!

35:49.355 --> 35:52.567
Sometimes, I look down and realize
I have the best job in the world.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.070
You know, it's hard to believe
that someone like you is a pilot.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.114
Yeah? What should
someone like me do for a living?

35:58.906 --> 35:59.866
Sales of some sort?

35:59.949 --> 36:01.159
[laughs]

36:04.704 --> 36:07.123
-What's happening?
-[Andrew] We're landin'.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.666
Just droppin' in to say hi.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.316
Over here.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.401
[birdsong]

36:43.576 --> 36:46.412
[Erica] A tropical island
in the middle of nowhere.

36:46.495 --> 36:51.918
It must be paradise living here.
No voicemail. No traffic.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.962
-No doctors. No stores. No help.
-[children laughing]

36:55.046 --> 36:58.007
Out here, if you can't build it
or grow it yourself, you do without.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.091
[all] Feliz Navidad!

36:59.175 --> 37:01.427
-Feliz Navidad!
-[laughs] Feliz Navidad!

37:01.510 --> 37:02.511
[Andrew chuckles]

37:02.595 --> 37:04.096
-Feliz Navidad.
-[child] Feliz Navidad.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.598
[both laugh]

37:05.681 --> 37:07.892
-And you hope for the best.
-Yeah, and there's that.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.393
This island's one of the lucky ones.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.480
Some of the other islands
only see a supply ship once a year.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.483
[Erica] How is it you know somebody
all the way out here?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.401
[Andrew] John-Michael was stationed
at the base.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.320
He's one of the best loadmasters
I ever had.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.655
Used to be?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.198
Buenas and hafa adai, cuz.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.407
Hafa adai, che'lu.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.661
Came back to help my family.
They needed a hand. I'm John-Michael.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.955
Hi, Erica Miller.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be nosy.

37:29.038 --> 37:32.083
No, if you're hanging with him, I think
someone deserves to cut you some slack.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.709
Wow! Shots fired!

37:33.793 --> 37:37.046
Thank you. Finally!
Someone who understands.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.174
Erica's visiting from DC.
I'm showing her around the islands.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.594
Oh, well, hope you like coconuts.
We've got a lot of coconuts.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.013
Come on. Let's go.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.937
-[laughter]
-[carabao bellowing]

37:53.020 --> 37:55.106
-[woman 1] They're beautiful.
-[woman 2] Thank you.

37:56.148 --> 37:58.109
[woman 3] Oh! Oh, I loved it.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.951
-[man] Please help with that…
-Oh, hello, little one!

38:07.034 --> 38:10.246
-Hi!
-Ha-hey! Good to see you.

38:10.329 --> 38:11.289
-You too!
-Hey, guys!

38:13.040 --> 38:14.542
[girl] Welcome to our village.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.169
[Erica] Thank you.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.171
It's beautiful.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.716
-Love it.
-Thank you.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.970
-[children laughing]
-[John-Michael] That's my niece, Ilana.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.346
She's a smart one.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.515
-Best reader in grade two.
-[Andrew] Right on.

38:29.598 --> 38:32.184
-You have a grade school here?
-Satellite internet school.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.770
But since power got knocked out
in the typhoon,

38:34.854 --> 38:36.105
school's been out of commission.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.650
[Andrew] Hopefully, that's just temporary.
We need to find another generator.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.235
Sampson said no again?

38:41.319 --> 38:44.947
Yeah. I'll make sure we have schoolbooks
and mosquito nets for the next drop.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.867
-[John-Michael] Thanks, bro.
-You provide schoolbooks?

38:47.950 --> 38:51.412
-[Andrew] Yeah, whatever's needed.
-Everything gets used. Boxes, strappings.

38:51.495 --> 38:54.540
Even the parachutes are valuable.
They get turned into sails for the canoes.

38:54.623 --> 38:55.458
Wow!

38:55.541 --> 38:57.835
You should see the kids swarm
when they hear the planes.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.879
It's like Santa himself
dropping off presents.

38:59.962 --> 39:00.796
[all laugh]

39:03.174 --> 39:05.051
[Erica] Hey, Ilana, I have an idea.

39:05.801 --> 39:09.347
How would you and your friends

39:09.430 --> 39:11.349
like some markers to draw with?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.018
-[children gasping]
-[girl] Can I see that?

39:14.101 --> 39:15.644
-Markers?
-[Erica] Yeah.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.438
-[children whispering]
-Hairbrush.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.106
-That's right.
-[girl] We don't have one.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.192
[Erica] I have a mirror compact in here.

39:21.275 --> 39:24.320
-[children gasping]
-[Erica] Oh, and here's some scrunchies.

39:24.403 --> 39:27.490
-There's a sweater, if you ever get cold.
-[girl] Oh, that's nice!

39:27.573 --> 39:29.575
[children whispering and laughing]

39:30.493 --> 39:32.203
Actually, why don't you just…

39:33.579 --> 39:35.414
take the bag?
You can put your seashells in it.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.625
-Thank you.
-[Erica] You're welcome.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.504
This is for you. For Christmas.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.049
[Erica] Wow!

39:46.759 --> 39:48.010
That's awesome.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.596
Thank you.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.056
Merry Christmas!

39:52.139 --> 39:53.682
[boy] I haven't tried that…

39:59.271 --> 40:01.065
Now you know how I feel
every time I come here.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.778
[John-Michael] All that's missing
is some Christmas music.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.365
Ilana, do you know anybody
that knows any Christmas carols?

40:09.448 --> 40:11.117
[chuckling]

40:13.744 --> 40:15.621
[all laughing]

40:16.122 --> 40:17.665
Oh, I don't know if now's the time.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.584
-Play, Uncle. Please!
-[laughter]

40:20.668 --> 40:23.421
Christmas carols on a ukulele?
This should be good.

40:23.504 --> 40:24.630
Any requests?

40:25.548 --> 40:27.007
Anything to make me forget

40:27.091 --> 40:30.010
I'm half a world away from home
at Christmas.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.806

41:50.883 --> 41:53.260

in the Capitol Building.

41:55.304 --> 41:57.056
And you did it all with a ukulele.

41:58.641 --> 42:02.186
Come on, it's time to show you
what we've been up to at Tarague Beach.

42:05.606 --> 42:09.276
So, what we're gonna do is
hook up 12 volts, uh, charger here.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.029
And so you can take the plus,
and I'll take the minus.

42:12.112 --> 42:12.947
[Sunshine] Okay.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.241

-Andrew. Erica.
-[Erica] Hey. Hafa adai, Sandra.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.847
[Andrew] So, every year, we put on
this Coconut Christmas fundraiser

42:38.931 --> 42:40.683
so we can raise money for the Drop.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.644
It stretches resources,
but it's worth it in the end.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.355
Don't tell me
this doesn't cost anything to put on.

42:46.855 --> 42:49.233
The wood is offcuts
from a local construction company.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.360
Everybody here brought
whatever lights they can spare.

42:51.443 --> 42:54.488
-Uh-huh.
-Food is supplied by a local church group.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.365
Brother Bruce and Sunshine over there
set it up

42:56.448 --> 42:58.617
so that we are 100% solar-powered.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.202
Brother Bruce?

43:01.161 --> 43:02.997
Bruce Best. He's a legend here.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.499
He's our link
between all the islands and atolls.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.669
He's been doing the Drop
for the last 40 years.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.213

-That's nice!

43:11.297 --> 43:12.756

43:20.014 --> 43:21.765
You know,
you agreed to give this a chance.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.810
That means unplugging that little
cash register you got in your head.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.563
Sorry. Sometimes, it's on autopilot.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.066
But I still don't get
what all this is for.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.820
To raise money for things that
we can't get donated, like generators.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.488
We gotta raise a lot of cash.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.324
[truck pulling up]

43:38.866 --> 43:40.618
[horn blares]

43:41.952 --> 43:43.329
[Andrew] More elves have arrived.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.247
-[chuckles]
-We'd better get to work.

43:46.081 --> 43:46.915
"We"?

43:48.167 --> 43:50.169
Our deal was you'd try to understand
what we do here.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.756
The best way to understand
is to pitch in.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.928
[woman 1] Yeah! This looks great.

44:00.721 --> 44:03.140
-Do you want to do a few more?
-[woman 2] Yeah.

44:03.223 --> 44:07.102
Not bad! [chuckles]
You've weaved palm leaves before?

44:07.186 --> 44:08.270
[laughter]

44:08.354 --> 44:11.523
Last weaving I did was
friendship bracelets,

Camp Tabonga, 11 years old.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.194
[chuckling]

44:15.277 --> 44:19.156
You know, I've been part of the Drop
since I was a little girl.

44:20.074 --> 44:25.621
My dad came from one of the islands.
Now my daughter and my grandson help, too.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.374
-[laughs]
-[Sandra] Well, hello there.

44:29.124 --> 44:31.377
-Hey.
-I see Andrew's already put you to work.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.962
-Yeah. He seems to have a talent for that.
-[chuckles]

44:34.046 --> 44:38.342
Well, no time for people to be homesick
when they have got something to do, right?

44:38.425 --> 44:41.178
Hey, Blitzen… need your help over here.

44:45.808 --> 44:49.478
We were making palm-leaf wreathes.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.979
Eh, we're resourceful.

44:52.022 --> 44:55.734
Instead of holly and mistletoe,
we got flame tree flowers.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.236
Gotta improvise a bit on traditions.

44:57.319 --> 45:00.531
So fruitcake made
with papaya and pineapple?

45:00.614 --> 45:03.200
Instead of Christmas ham,
you got Christmas Spam.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.744
[laughs] Instead of sledding
at grandma's backyard?

45:06.328 --> 45:07.955
Christmas snorkeling on the reef.

45:08.622 --> 45:10.332
Oh! That'd be fun.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.543
Wait.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.337
You've never been Christmas snorkeling?

45:15.963 --> 45:19.633
I've never been Christmas, Easter,
or Valentine's snorkeling.

45:21.301 --> 45:24.555
-You don't know what you're missin'.
-I've never even worn a snorkel.

45:24.638 --> 45:27.891
Closest I have come is swimming through
budget reports while holding my nose.

45:38.944 --> 45:41.405
-Long day.
-Mm-hm.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.449
-But a good one.
-That we can agree on.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.577
-[sighs]
-So, I have a question.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.620
You're an officer, so…

45:49.747 --> 45:51.373
why aren't you spending Christmas at home?

45:53.625 --> 45:57.921
Well… right now, I'm commanding my unit,
so I have to be here.

45:58.005 --> 46:01.300
But you're right.
I could… pull some strings.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.846
I'm also the only one here who's
an air logistics planner and a pilot,

46:05.929 --> 46:08.932
so the Christmas Drop needs
someone with my…

46:09.933 --> 46:10.809
How should I put it?

46:10.893 --> 46:13.270
Unique skill at finagling things.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.022
[chuckles]

46:16.148 --> 46:18.650
What's your excuse?
You could be anywhere, and you're here.

46:20.694 --> 46:25.324
I have a lot riding on this assignment.
A promotion, maybe a really big one and…

46:26.825 --> 46:30.788
[clears throat] Anyways, I like to stay
in motion during Christmas these days.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.999
By working over the holidays?
Don't you wanna be home?

46:36.960 --> 46:39.129
My mom passed away three years ago, so…

46:40.798 --> 46:41.673
I'm really sorry.

46:41.757 --> 46:45.677
We used to have Christmas caroling
by the fire and…

46:47.638 --> 46:49.556
my mom's voice was loudest of all.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.516
[chuckles]

46:51.433 --> 46:54.770
There was mulled cider
and gingerbread and…

46:57.606 --> 47:00.025
Now it's just not the same, so…

47:00.108 --> 47:02.528
Especially since my dad got remarried
last year.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.530
Ouch.

47:05.906 --> 47:08.200
No, she's nice, actually. She is.

47:08.283 --> 47:10.118
-She's just--
-Not your mom?

47:10.619 --> 47:11.662
Not my mom.

47:13.747 --> 47:17.000
Well, if there is one thing I've learned
out here on this island,

47:17.084 --> 47:19.336
it's that, though you never wanna
forget your traditions,

47:19.419 --> 47:21.547
there's always room to make new ones.

47:23.090 --> 47:26.510
So, tomorrow, we go Christmas snorkeling.

47:28.011 --> 47:30.639
-No. It's already been 24 hours!
-What?

47:30.722 --> 47:32.975
-We need to hit it hard tomorrow.
-Sleeping doesn't count.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.935
-You're still on the hook for 12 hours.
-My gosh!

47:35.018 --> 47:37.020
You're always working an angle,
aren't you?

47:39.731 --> 47:40.983
[clears throat]

47:41.692 --> 47:42.776
Better go, I guess.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.611
Work and…

47:44.695 --> 47:45.737
Yeah.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.407
-Find you in the morning?
-Yep.

47:48.490 --> 47:49.408
Okay.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.797
[sighs]

48:03.881 --> 48:05.883
[frogs croaking]

48:09.803 --> 48:13.807
[Sally] The big news is,
Sheila tendered her resignation.

48:13.891 --> 48:14.725
Shut up.

48:14.808 --> 48:18.061
Congresswoman Bradford now
officially needs a new chief of staff.

48:18.145 --> 48:21.148
Oh! And I'm 8,000 miles away,
chasing my tail.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.859
I'm pretty sure
you're still on the top of her list.

48:23.942 --> 48:26.028
She asked me for an ETA on your report

48:26.111 --> 48:27.821
and to let you know
about the job opening up.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.781
I can get something to her
in a couple days.

48:29.865 --> 48:32.534
She'll be on a plane in two days
to Singapore

48:32.618 --> 48:34.244
to meet with her family for the holidays.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.330
Pretty sure she's gonna ask for it
before she leaves.

48:36.413 --> 48:39.625
Right. Um… I'll just bear down
and get it done.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.503
Is that a flower in your hair?

48:45.881 --> 48:50.010
Oh. Yeah. I just… took a shortcut
through some bushes. It's…

48:50.093 --> 48:51.094
Mm-hm.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.555
It's not like you to take a shortcut, Er.

48:53.639 --> 48:56.558
Sounds like that island
is working its magic on you.

48:58.268 --> 48:59.394
[whispers] Gotta go.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.854
[beeping]

49:09.196 --> 49:11.990
[Andrew's mother] Oh, you should have seen
the carolers tonight, honey.

49:12.074 --> 49:14.493
Three different groups
all trying to out-sing each other!

49:14.576 --> 49:16.536
-[laughter]
-It was just…

49:16.620 --> 49:19.539
[Andrew] Man, I miss those cold walks
into town with you guys.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.208
We could have used you when we got back.

49:21.291 --> 49:23.669
Dad made us shovel up
the path to the barn.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.171
Even though it's still snowing.

49:26.254 --> 49:28.840
I'd like to make a toast
to us being together.

49:28.924 --> 49:31.259
-[mom] Oh, yes.
-[dad] There is nothing…

49:31.343 --> 49:34.262
[breaking up] …like family at Christmas.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.431
[Andrew] Guys? You're breaking up.

49:36.515 --> 49:37.516
[beeping]

49:37.599 --> 49:39.601
Guys? Dad?

49:39.685 --> 49:40.978
[tapping keyboard]

49:41.561 --> 49:43.271
-And you're gone.
-Hey.

49:45.357 --> 49:46.441
Door was just open.

49:47.025 --> 49:48.860
Yeah, we… We do that here.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.530
Am I interrupting? Are you…

49:51.613 --> 49:53.031
No. No, I'm all done.

49:54.741 --> 49:56.118
Everything okay?

49:56.201 --> 49:57.536
Yeah. I was, uh…

49:58.453 --> 50:02.165
just trying to FaceTime with my family.
We were gonna have dinner together,

50:02.249 --> 50:04.710
but the internet on their end
had different plans.

50:05.335 --> 50:06.503
Sorry to hear that.

50:08.422 --> 50:10.340
Anyway, you ready to go
Christmas snorkeling?

50:10.424 --> 50:12.634
Actually, I stopped by to say I can't go.

50:13.218 --> 50:16.179
-Really? Why not?
-I'm getting pressure from Washington.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.598
-Speed things up.
-That's exactly why you have to go.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.183
-Uh-- I'm--
-As soon as possible.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.144
Getting in the water
is the best cure for stress.

50:22.227 --> 50:24.771
You come out feeling more relaxed,
more efficient…

50:25.480 --> 50:27.149
if that's even possible for you.

50:28.066 --> 50:29.151
Wanna be good at your job?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.737
Snorkel.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.535
[Andrew] All right. That should do it.

50:39.327 --> 50:40.328
[Erica] Thanks.

50:41.496 --> 50:43.040
[Andrew] Ready to take the plunge?

50:44.041 --> 50:45.709
[Erica] As ready as I'll ever be.

50:46.501 --> 50:47.627
-All right, let's go.
-Now?

50:47.711 --> 50:48.795
-Yep.
-Okay.

52:06.164 --> 52:09.960
That parrotfish

52:10.043 --> 52:13.463
And the turtle, I tried to swim
back to it, but it kept getting away.

52:14.214 --> 52:17.342
And just like that,
a new Christmas tradition is born.

52:17.425 --> 52:18.552
[laughs]

52:23.473 --> 52:26.017
[Erica] The Procurement Office has
a data drive ready for me,

52:26.101 --> 52:29.104
and I have a meeting with the general
at Wing Headquarters in an hour.

52:29.771 --> 52:30.689
[Andrew] Suit yourself.

52:30.772 --> 52:33.567
I've gotta do a bit of horse-trading
for the fundraiser tonight anyway.

52:33.650 --> 52:34.609
[Erica] Okay.

52:35.944 --> 52:38.196
[Sunshine] Captain!
Your shipment's arrived.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.406
I see that!

52:40.448 --> 52:44.911
Wait. Three-- How did you get
ten Douglas firs halfway across the world?

52:45.453 --> 52:47.455
It's not gonna end up
in some sort of report, is it?

52:48.123 --> 52:50.167
I promise you
it didn't cost the taxpayers a penny.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.127
I find that hard to believe.

52:52.752 --> 52:54.588
So a guy I know in Oregon
owns a tree farm.

52:54.671 --> 52:58.133
He donated ten trees and dropped them off
at Portland at the Air National Guard.

52:58.216 --> 53:01.094
They flew them to San Diego because
they were going there for training.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.804
And a buddy at the Naval Air Station there

53:02.888 --> 53:05.557
was flying a C-40 of recruits
to Pearl Harbor, so…

53:06.683 --> 53:08.643
So that's only halfway.

53:08.727 --> 53:12.772
Then, from Pearl, they ended up as freight
on a half-empty supply flight to Saipan,

53:12.856 --> 53:16.651
where they were put on a Super Hercules
already due for depot maintenance here.

53:16.735 --> 53:19.571
-Okay, but that doesn't--
-But nothin'.

53:20.071 --> 53:21.907
Come see
what all this free transport gets us.

53:21.990 --> 53:22.991
It's time to trade horses.

53:39.132 --> 53:40.717
[brakes squeal]

53:43.220 --> 53:45.513
[woman] Oh!
That's the same one we had last year!

53:45.597 --> 53:47.974
-[man] Hey, Andrew! How are you?
-[Andrew] Hey, how you doing?

53:48.058 --> 53:51.269
-[man] Thank you for bringing the trees.
-[Andrew] Thank you for taking them.

53:53.897 --> 53:54.731
[Erica] Hello.

53:54.814 --> 53:56.149
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Hi.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.068
[Andrew] Watch out. It's heavy. All right.

53:58.151 --> 53:59.444
[manager] Put them in the lobby.

53:59.527 --> 54:01.655
-[Andrew] Okay.
-So, what's the angle here?

54:01.738 --> 54:04.741
Thing you gotta remember is,
it's about finding the right angle.

54:04.824 --> 54:07.452
-[man] They're beautiful.
-I made a deal with hotel management.

54:07.535 --> 54:10.455
They are now officially the only resort
on the island

54:10.538 --> 54:11.957
that carries real Douglas fir trees,

54:12.040 --> 54:14.000
just in time
for the Christmas Eve banquet tonight.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.335
In exchange for what?

54:15.418 --> 54:17.087
Ten cases of soap, 20 sets of sheets,

54:17.170 --> 54:20.840
15 packs of rice, six sets of pots
that their new chef doesn't really like,

54:20.924 --> 54:22.634
and eight dozen eggs
for the eggnog tonight.

54:22.717 --> 54:25.136
-All that for some trees?
-For some free trees. Yeah.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.138
And…

54:30.225 --> 54:33.228
a little one to brighten up someone's room
who's far away from home.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.442
All right, let's, uh, finish unloading
these so we can get you back

54:39.526 --> 54:41.611
so you can dive into that data drive,
meet the general,

54:41.695 --> 54:44.030
then we have a few hours
before we put our party pants on.

54:45.615 --> 54:46.574
[Erica] Okay. Come on.

54:46.658 --> 54:48.618
-[buzz of conversation]
-[bells jingling]

54:48.702 --> 54:49.995
[man] Andrew, over here!

54:51.413 --> 54:53.456
-Yeah, that's it.
-Wow!

54:54.040 --> 54:55.208
[Andrew] A flurry.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.544
-[Joker] Coconut shavings away!
-[laughter]

55:00.005 --> 55:02.173
And that's a white Christmas
in the tropics.

55:03.341 --> 55:04.634
Oh.

55:04.718 --> 55:05.927
Oh, wow.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.317
You pack a dress like this
everywhere you go?

55:20.400 --> 55:23.361
[laughs] Guess you're not the only one
who can horse-trade, Captain.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.323
Does it look okay?

55:27.741 --> 55:28.575
Yeah.

55:30.118 --> 55:30.952
You look beautiful.

55:32.579 --> 55:33.913
I like you in blue.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.210
Good job, Andrew.

55:39.294 --> 55:42.672
[laughs] I mean, I never knew
coconut could stand in for snow.

55:43.715 --> 55:46.634
Yeah. Uh, it took us a while
to figure that out.

55:47.469 --> 55:51.306
Last year, we tried
freeze-dried potatoes au gratin.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.433
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

55:53.975 --> 55:57.520
-[Andrew] And, uh… it wasn't pretty.
-[Erica] No?

55:58.104 --> 56:00.273
-[Andrew] Hey, everybody, gather in.
-Oh, there they are.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.192
Let's get this party started.

56:02.275 --> 56:04.736
-[man] Oh, come on. Yeah, over here.
-[woman] Come on.

56:04.819 --> 56:05.987
[Sunshine] Brother Bruce.

56:06.529 --> 56:08.073
You ready for this, Auntie?

56:08.156 --> 56:08.990
Let's do it.

56:09.074 --> 56:10.200
Ah, ooh!

56:10.283 --> 56:13.370
Hacha, hugua, tulu!

56:13.953 --> 56:16.623
[cheering and applause]

56:16.706 --> 56:18.500
[woman 1] Whoo-hoo!

56:18.583 --> 56:19.959
[woman 2] Yeah!

56:21.294 --> 56:23.380
-[whooping and cheering]
-So…

56:23.463 --> 56:25.757
So this is
what a tropical Christmas is like?

56:25.840 --> 56:28.218
Like Rockefeller Plaza with palm trees.

56:28.301 --> 56:30.136
Oh! I see a few guests without drinks,

56:30.220 --> 56:33.139
and drinks are our biggest mark-up,
so I best be on my way.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.682
-See you in a bit.
-Okay.

56:34.766 --> 56:36.768
-[laughter]
-[music playing]

56:37.352 --> 56:38.186
[woman] Whoo!

56:38.269 --> 56:41.147
He's, uh… always workin' an angle, huh?

56:41.231 --> 56:42.649
Oh, yeah, pretty much.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.902
Yeah, smooth-talker.
Ladies must love that.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.864
Actually, not really.

56:50.407 --> 56:52.617
Uh, he may seem
like he's got all the moves,

56:53.493 --> 56:56.496
but you know
how Captain got his call sign, "Claws"?

56:57.330 --> 57:01.209
Figured it was because he had his claws
in every pretty tourist passing through.

57:01.709 --> 57:07.215
Uh, "CLAWS," as in,
"Can't Leave Anyone Without Santa."

57:07.298 --> 57:10.176
Cap'n steps up
whenever anybody needs help.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.679
Brings Christmas to everyone, everywhere.

57:12.762 --> 57:14.347

worst of this one will miss them, but--

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:36.635
Operation Christmas Drop
can't happen.

1:07:36.719 --> 1:07:37.928
[Hatcher] Not on this schedule.

1:07:38.012 --> 1:07:40.931
It may be after Christmas
before we get back in the air.

1:07:41.015 --> 1:07:41.932
[sighs]

1:07:42.641 --> 1:07:44.143
Then we need to work faster.

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:45.770
Load up. Go now.

1:07:46.687 --> 1:07:49.148
Anyways, maybe the typhoon will veer off
in another direction.

1:07:49.231 --> 1:07:53.360
The furthest island is 11 hours out
and 11 hours back. We just can't make it.

1:07:53.444 --> 1:07:55.404
I won't put our people at risk.

1:07:56.739 --> 1:08:00.367
But what we can do is keep sorting
and packing right up until we can't.

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.162
And hope for a Christmas miracle.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.334
What?

1:08:09.543 --> 1:08:10.544
They happen.

1:08:15.966 --> 1:08:18.260
All right, people. Let's get to it.

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:42.785
All right, everybody, final items.

1:08:42.868 --> 1:08:46.205
Let's make sure you got school supplies.
Let's start closing it up.

1:08:46.747 --> 1:08:48.499
If your friends on the Hill
could see you now.

1:08:48.582 --> 1:08:50.584
If they could see me now, I'd be fired.

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:53.129
[Joker] Okay, my little elves.

1:08:53.212 --> 1:08:54.463
Bring it in.

1:08:55.798 --> 1:08:57.174
Yeah, bring it in.

Sorry, ma'am, I wasn't expecting you.

1:09:58.194 --> 1:10:01.363
Sally was supposed to call and tell you
that I rerouted through Honolulu.

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:03.490

1:10:03.574 --> 1:10:07.620
And the report that I was supposed
to have in my hands before I left.

1:10:07.703 --> 1:10:10.080
But, congresswoman,
you didn't have to fly in.

1:10:10.164 --> 1:10:13.417
Ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I'm afraid, if anyone's to blame, it's me.

Captain, I don't know you,

1:10:16.462 --> 1:10:19.632
but I recognize your face
from that photo in the newspaper.

1:10:20.549 --> 1:10:21.926
You're part of the problem.

1:10:22.009 --> 1:10:24.303
Now, would you please explain to me
what's going on,

1:10:24.386 --> 1:10:27.598
because this is obviously
Operation Christmas Drop.

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:33.938
Yeah, but, like I said,
it's all done by donations.

1:10:34.021 --> 1:10:37.566
It provides resources to people in need
over thousands of square miles.

1:10:40.027 --> 1:10:41.737
Now, how is this benefiting Americans?

1:10:41.820 --> 1:10:44.448
Congresswoman, this base is
America's forward operating outpost

1:10:44.531 --> 1:10:45.574
in a region of hostile--

1:10:45.658 --> 1:10:48.827
Your commander already briefed me
on the base's mission.

1:10:48.911 --> 1:10:51.163
Then you are aware the mission
of this base is to provide

1:10:51.247 --> 1:10:53.207
a US-based war-fighting platform,

1:10:53.290 --> 1:10:57.878
as well as a rapid-response
humanitarian relief program worldwide.

1:11:00.798 --> 1:11:03.425
I'm going to Singapore in the morning,
weather permitting.

1:11:03.509 --> 1:11:05.135
Erica, I think it's time you went home.

1:11:05.219 --> 1:11:06.720
But I'm… I'm not done--

1:11:06.804 --> 1:11:09.181
I'm gonna let Matt and his team
take this over,

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:12.268
and they can review
what you've found back in DC.

1:11:12.810 --> 1:11:16.397
I want you back at your desk,
doing your job.

1:11:17.022 --> 1:11:18.399
Lieutenant Bradley.

1:11:25.114 --> 1:11:26.824
I better go pack.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:30.828

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:34.748
What happened to
"We're doing whatever it takes"?

1:11:34.832 --> 1:11:37.960
You heard her. My job is on the line.

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:40.421
The winds are picking up,
and the typhoon is on its way.

1:11:40.504 --> 1:11:43.549
If we speed up our packing, we can
get a drop off first, before it hits.

1:11:43.632 --> 1:11:47.469
I'm done with the Drop.
And if my boss has her way, you are too.

-It's okay.

-I kept trying your cell.
-Sal!

It's okay. I don't know
what I would have done differently,

1:12:39.104 --> 1:12:41.065
even if I'd known she was coming, so…

1:12:42.024 --> 1:12:45.235
Just finished packing
and saying goodbye to a friend.

1:12:46.362 --> 1:12:47.279
That pilot?

1:12:48.989 --> 1:12:52.242
Actually, this one is green
with four legs.

1:12:52.326 --> 1:12:53.911
I've grown kind of fond of him.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.794
You sure about coming back home now?

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:05.381
What can I do?

1:13:06.590 --> 1:13:08.092

1:13:08.884 --> 1:13:10.427
It's just not like you to give up.

1:13:10.511 --> 1:13:14.932
I know. And this is the first Christmas
I've actually enjoyed in a while.

Reminds you of what?

1:13:28.487 --> 1:13:29.696
Of Christmas.

1:13:32.449 --> 1:13:33.784
Like it used to be.

1:13:38.997 --> 1:13:40.666
Sally, I have to go. [chuckles]

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:43.293
I've got something I have to finish.

1:13:53.512 --> 1:13:55.305
Jake, how about
another cranberry and soda?

1:13:56.014 --> 1:13:57.015
Comin' up.

1:13:59.143 --> 1:14:02.146
You can go home to your family, man.
I'll lock up when I leave.

I don't care about my flight.

It's yours I'm thinking about.
This weather doesn't have to ground you.

It has grounded me.

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.831
I just saw a Christmas tree
that made its way

to San Diego to Saipan…

-It's not a wish.

It's a miracle.

I just talked to Travis.

He's been on the phone with
the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at Pearl.

1:15:37.783 --> 1:15:40.953
They have a P-3 over top of the storm,
and they say it's rapidly degrading.

1:15:41.036 --> 1:15:43.372
General Hatcher said it is up to you,

1:15:43.455 --> 1:15:47.000
the mission commander,
to decide if we take off.

1:15:49.211 --> 1:15:50.963
If we take off?

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:53.423
You called me Blitzen, right?

1:15:54.508 --> 1:15:56.969

-Ma'am.

1:17:17.299 --> 1:17:20.636
I thought I asked you
to stop this whole Christmas thing.

1:17:20.719 --> 1:17:22.304
Yes, you did ask, congresswoman.

1:17:22.387 --> 1:17:27.017
And I thought I was quite clear that
I wanted you on a plane stateside today.

1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:29.561
You were clear, ma'am,
but there's too much for me to do here.

1:17:30.562 --> 1:17:31.396
I'm sorry?

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.940
Respectfully, ma'am, what's happening here
is far more important

1:17:34.024 --> 1:17:35.400
than what I'd be doing back home.

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:38.362
You're very close
to throwing it all away, Ms. Miller.

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:44.117
I'm gonna stay here and help.

1:17:45.535 --> 1:17:47.120
And you should too.

1:17:49.247 --> 1:17:51.124
I remember, when you first got elected,

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:54.670
the cornerstone of your campaign
was to make the world a better place.

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:58.924
You promised your constituents that
you would work on making a difference.

1:23:47.439 --> 1:23:49.065
Better than okay!

1:23:49.149 --> 1:23:51.359
This is what Christmas
is supposed to feel like.

1:23:51.443 --> 1:23:52.444
Yeah, it is.

1:24:04.122 --> 1:24:05.331

-[Andrew] Way to go. Way to go.

1:24:20.972 --> 1:24:22.932
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel Blaine.

1:24:23.016 --> 1:24:25.643
That was… spectacular.

1:24:28.521 --> 1:24:29.522
And very moving.

1:24:30.523 --> 1:24:33.068
Well, you are more
than welcome, congresswoman.

1:24:33.151 --> 1:24:35.695
Please let me know if there is
anything else I can help you with

1:24:35.779 --> 1:24:38.239
once you guys have had your talk.

1:24:48.374 --> 1:24:50.752
The base could cut waste
and maximize efficiencies

1:24:50.835 --> 1:24:53.213
by privatizing housing
and base support functions,

1:24:53.296 --> 1:24:56.132
like the gym, dining hall,

1:24:56.758 --> 1:25:00.178
postal support,
all contracted out to reduce the overhead.

1:25:00.261 --> 1:25:01.596
I'll have to see the numbers.

1:25:01.679 --> 1:25:03.807
Yeah. Sally is working with Matt
on getting them for you

1:25:03.890 --> 1:25:05.475
by the time you hit Singapore.

1:25:05.558 --> 1:25:07.811
I don't know if it's gonna be enough.

1:25:07.894 --> 1:25:12.398
Ma'am, my task here
was to find the inefficiencies.

1:25:12.482 --> 1:25:16.861
The problem is there just aren't enough
to justify shutting down this base.

1:25:18.029 --> 1:25:23.868
These men and women are working diligently
at stretching every cent they have.

1:25:24.702 --> 1:25:27.747
Okay? Operation Christmas Drop
is just one example of that.

1:25:27.831 --> 1:25:31.042
Lieutenant Colonel Blaine
walked me through the donations,

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:32.752
the training, volunteer time.

1:25:32.836 --> 1:25:36.381
The Joint Chiefs call this island
an unsinkable aircraft carrier.

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:39.551
Couple that with the training and the work
with the outlying communities,

1:25:39.634 --> 1:25:44.305
you have a very compelling argument
to take this base off of the list.

1:25:47.392 --> 1:25:48.476
Did you see…

1:25:49.644 --> 1:25:53.731
the look on the faces of the islanders
when they saw our planes coming in?

1:25:53.815 --> 1:25:55.233
I did, ma'am.

1:25:55.316 --> 1:25:58.820
I haven't seen that kind of joy
in a very long time.

1:25:59.654 --> 1:26:03.366
To see our military making
that kind of difference in people's lives,

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.537
that was what Christmas should look like.

1:26:08.079 --> 1:26:11.791
-You know, I couldn't agree more.
-You're very good at what you do.

1:26:13.042 --> 1:26:15.670
And I'm so glad you're working with me.

1:26:17.088 --> 1:26:18.715
See you back in DC.

1:26:18.798 --> 1:26:22.594
There is an empty desk there
waiting for someone like you to fill it.

1:26:23.887 --> 1:26:25.763
It would be my honor, ma'am.

1:26:27.056 --> 1:26:32.562
And thank you… for reminding me
why I got into this in the first place.

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.066
Merry Christmas, Erica.

1:26:37.817 --> 1:26:39.527
Merry Christmas, Angela.

1:26:57.712 --> 1:26:59.380
[Erica sobbing]

1:27:01.925 --> 1:27:04.719
-So, was that a "you're fired" hug?
-Eh…

1:27:04.802 --> 1:27:06.846
[laughs] No.

1:27:07.764 --> 1:27:09.265
I just wanna thank you…

1:27:10.975 --> 1:27:13.436
for getting me involved
in everything around here.

1:27:15.355 --> 1:27:18.191
Helping play Santa
got my Christmas spirit back.

1:27:19.192 --> 1:27:20.735
[chuckles]

1:27:20.818 --> 1:27:22.904
Somethin' told me you had it all along.

1:27:30.328 --> 1:27:31.412
[Erica] So…

1:27:32.622 --> 1:27:35.124
Christmas Eve
on the other side of the world.

1:27:35.625 --> 1:27:38.878
[Andrew] Yeah. It's not home,
but we try to make it feel that way.

1:27:39.712 --> 1:27:42.715
It's not really home though,
not without family.

1:27:43.466 --> 1:27:47.262
Yeah, well,
my family is 8,000 miles away, so…

1:27:47.345 --> 1:27:50.056
Actually, they're only
about 80 yards away.

1:27:50.765 --> 1:27:52.433
They flew in this afternoon.

1:27:52.934 --> 1:27:55.979
They're getting ready for Christmas dinner
at the general's house.

1:27:58.147 --> 1:27:59.190
What are you talking about?

1:27:59.274 --> 1:28:02.026
You're not the only one
that can cut through red tape.

1:28:02.110 --> 1:28:03.361
[laughter]

1:28:04.445 --> 1:28:07.615
[Andrew's mother] Thank you for having us.
This is really great.

1:28:08.366 --> 1:28:10.034
[laughing] Uh… What?

1:28:11.369 --> 1:28:13.162
That-- that must've cost a fortune.

1:28:13.830 --> 1:28:15.623
Didn't cost a cent.

1:28:16.207 --> 1:28:18.960
There was a TV news crew already flying in
to cover the Drop.

1:28:19.043 --> 1:28:20.628
A news reporter owed me a favor.

1:28:20.712 --> 1:28:23.423
There was some space on the plane,
and I guess I was…

1:28:24.173 --> 1:28:25.341
feeling inspired.

1:28:26.301 --> 1:28:28.177
Someone once made me see
that, sometimes in life,

1:28:28.261 --> 1:28:30.263
you just have to find the right angle.

1:28:35.393 --> 1:28:36.311
