RESYNC BY BSpidey87

00:36.000 --> 00:38.500
<i>These were the scenes everyone feared.</i>

00:38.400 --> 00:41.500
<i>Running battles
between English and Turkish fans...</i>

00:48.600 --> 00:51.100
<i>...some here have been
seriously injured.</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:06.500
<i>...it's very violent indeed.</i>

01:54.700 --> 01:56.900
<i>Earlier, there was mayhem
on the main square...</i>

02:10.400 --> 02:15.200
<i>Getting beaten up by football hooligans is like
having VD: the fuckin' pain goes on forever.</i>

02:15.600 --> 02:17.300
<i>But that's what makes it so exciting.</i>

02:17.900 --> 02:21.300
<i>So this is me, Tommy Johnson
three weeks from now, nearly dead.</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:25.000
<i>And do you know what the funniest thing is?
I could see it coming.</i>

02:25.700 --> 02:29.900
<i>Anyway, it's almost over now
and all that matters is this: was it worth it?</i>

02:47.800 --> 02:49.400
<i>There's nothing different about me.</i>

02:49.600 --> 02:53.800
<i>I'm just ahother bored male approaching 30,
in a dead-end job who lives for the weekend.</i>

02:54.100 --> 02:57.100
<i>Casual sex, watered-down lager,
heavily cut drugs.</i>

02:57.300 --> 02:59.400
<i>And occasionally kicking
fuck out of someone.</i>

03:30.900 --> 03:32.500
Zeberdee, it's Bill.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.500
What? How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?

03:34.700 --> 03:37.200
I'm fuckin' buzzin'!
We've gone right through the slit.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.000
Keep your fuckin' nut down.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.000
He's a right fuckin' stringer, this kid.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.800
- What's he say?
- Nothing.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.100
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin' hung up.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.800
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.500
There's a pub on the corner called
the Ship and Billet. Head for that.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.400
I'll have to bell you back,
Harris is trying to get through.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.500
Just spotted their little firm
going to a pub in Denbigh Street.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.700
They won't know what's fuckin' hit 'em.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.500
There you are.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.100
Here, come here!

04:23.600 --> 04:24.800
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.500
- Where's the others?
- On their way.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.700
- Harris said there's about 25 of the others.
- There won't be when we've finished with 'em.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.700
Wait round the corner!

04:32.900 --> 04:34.300
What for?

04:34.300 --> 04:37.600
Cos it's all going to be on top,
us all standin' here, you si.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.500
- Jog on.
- Jog on!

04:39.600 --> 04:41.000
Bill, it's Harris.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Hello, son. Yeah?

04:45.400 --> 04:46.600
All right. See you there.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.200
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.700
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.700
Ended up down the petrol garage
at two o'clock in the morning.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.700
What you driving for?
You're on a ban, you lunatic.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.500
Ban? What am I gonna do, walk?

05:40.300 --> 05:42.300
Here he is.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.900
Right, there's someone
outside the pub.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
- How old is he?
- He's only a kid.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.800
Go on, crack him.
Keep the noise down.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.800
<i>Keep the noise down.</i>

06:01.900 --> 06:04.800
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don't fuck about, ping him.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.800
Let's go!

06:09.400 --> 06:11.700
It's going good anyway.
Let's settle it.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.600
- Come on, let's...
- Keep it down, keep it down.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.200
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin' hell, come on, boys.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.300
Keep it down, keep it down.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.600
- Come on. Fuckin' hell.
- Keep it down.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.300
Don't fuck this up.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.800
Fuckin' clowns won't stop us.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.300
You're fuckin' animals!

07:18.500 --> 07:21.100
You give this fuckin' country
a bad fuckin' name!

07:22.900 --> 07:26.400
You ain't no football supporters!
You're fuckin' muggy little cunts!

07:34.500 --> 07:36.300
<i>What else are you gonna
do on a Saturday?</i>

07:36.500 --> 07:39.200
<i>Sit in your fuckin' armchair wankin' off
to Pop Idols?</i>

07:39.400 --> 07:41.000
<i>Then try and avoid your wife's gaze</i>

07:41.200 --> 07:43.800
<i>as you struggle to come to terms
with your sexless marriage?</i>

07:44.000 --> 07:47.300
<i>Then go and spunk your wages on kebabs
fruit machines and brasses?</i>

07:47.600 --> 07:49.000
<i>Fuck that for a laugh!</i>

07:49.000 --> 07:50.500
<i>I know what I'd rather do.</i>

07:50.700 --> 07:52.500
<i>Tottenham away.
Love it!</i>

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
How fuckin' perfect was that?

08:10.200 --> 08:14.900
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get
the canister inside the fuckin' pub this time.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.800
Do you remember that time at Upton...

08:16.900 --> 08:19.400
That time at Upton Park,
he let it off on the tube!

08:19.600 --> 08:23.300
Mind you, premature ejaculation,
that's right up your fuckin' street!

08:24.500 --> 08:27.900
Anyway, he's virtually throwing 'em
out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?

08:28.200 --> 08:31.600
He's throwing 'em out of the fuckin' pub at me.
Crunch! Crunch!

08:31.800 --> 08:35.700
I hit this geezer so fuckin' hard,
his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.799
State of that. I done me knuckles.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.799
So hit people in the mouth,
not the back of the fuckin' head.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.300
Just as well I did or you'd be in hospital,
you cunt.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.900
<i>No-one loved Chelsea
more than me and Rod.</i>

08:50.100 --> 08:53.700
<i>We grew up on football terraces together
with my old man. He knew the score.</i>

08:53.900 --> 08:56.500
<i>The first bit of advice he give me was:</i>

08:56.700 --> 08:59.200
You know what to do
if someone tries to clump you?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.800
Kick him in the fuckin' bollocks.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.100
<i>Me and Rod did everything together.</i>

09:04.300 --> 09:06.100
Hurry up, Tom, I'm starving.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.500
<i>It took me an hour just to find it.
Still Rod didn't need to know that.</i>

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
She ain't walkin' for a week.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.500
<i>My grandad old Bill Farrell,
drove us to drink</i>

09:13.700 --> 09:17.200
<i>with his stories about the war
and how he fought to put the Great into Britain.</i>

09:17.500 --> 09:20.500
<i>He said fighting at football was nothing
compared to the Germans.</i>

09:20.700 --> 09:23.500
"We'll fight them on the beaches,
we'll fight them on the..."

09:23.700 --> 09:27.200
<i>Although he went on, he was right.
We're an island race. It's what we do best.</i>

09:27.500 --> 09:31.100
<i>It's not about colour or race,
it's just the buzz of being in the front line.</i>

09:31.200 --> 09:33.100
<i>Truth is,
I just love to fight.</i>

09:33.300 --> 09:34.900
<i>There's nothing wrong with me...</i>

09:35.100 --> 09:39.000
<i>unlike Billy Bright, whose dad had a funny way
of setting a good example for his son.</i>

09:39.100 --> 09:41.400
Right, that's it.
I'll fight every one of you

09:41.600 --> 09:44.200
before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!

09:44.400 --> 09:47.300
<i>With parents like that,
he was never gonna end up in Greenpeace.</i>

09:47.600 --> 09:49.900
<i>Still he was one of
the first football thugs</i>

09:50.100 --> 09:53.300
<i>to see there was a fortune to be made
from England's love for ecstasy.</i>

09:53.500 --> 09:55.400
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.800
<i>Problem was he'd taken so many beatings on
the terraces that he weren't scared of anyone.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:03.500
<i>And the correct medical term for that is
a "total fuckin' psycho".</i>

10:03.700 --> 10:07.800
Bill, let's get out of here.
There's about ten Stoke fans staring at us.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.500
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten. Please don't start, Bill.

10:11.700 --> 10:15.800
<i>- Right, which one of them's staring at me.
- The big geezer with the Hackett cap on.</i>

10:16.000 --> 10:19.100
See you, you cunt. I'll cut you first.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.000
<i>And that was his idea of a good day out.</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:25.400
You fuckin' mugs!

10:25.600 --> 10:31.200
<i>But underneath the fun and games
and Range Rovers, Blliy was bitter,</i>

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
<i>cos he hever got to run our firm.</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:35.300
<i>Harris was top boy and that was that.</i>

10:35.500 --> 10:38.600
<i>He was smarter than Billy
and ran things like an army unit.</i>

10:38.700 --> 10:42.900
<i>Deep down Billy knew he'd never be leader
and because of that he hated Zeberdee.</i>

10:43.200 --> 10:45.300
<i>Why? Simple...</i>

10:45.500 --> 10:47.700
<i>Zeberdee looked up to Harris and not him.</i>

10:47.900 --> 10:51.900
<i>And the more Zeberdee looked up to Harris,
the more Billy bullied him.</i>

10:52.200 --> 10:54.400
<i>And what chance did Zeberdee have as a kid,</i>

10:54.600 --> 10:57.500
<i>brought up in a concrete jungle
on glue and hate?</i>

10:57.700 --> 11:00.600
<i>I don't envy the young 'uns any more.
It's a nightmare.</i>

11:00.800 --> 11:05.000
<i>Warfare from the playground upwards and you
know what you have to do to survive in combat.</i>

11:05.900 --> 11:06.700
Aargh!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.100
<i>Just like me and Rod,
him and Raff are best mates,</i>

11:13.300 --> 11:16.100
<i>only difference being
they're thieving little cunts.</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:19.800
<i>In case you're wondering, we call him Zeberdee
cos he loves sniffin' powder.</i>

11:20.100 --> 11:22.600
<i>And one dayn it'll be his downfall.</i>

11:27.500 --> 11:29.700
Hold your hand out, Raff.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.000
- What?
- Hold your hand out.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
<i>You're just a fuckin' kid, ain't you?</i>

11:39.800 --> 11:41.400
Hold your hand out, Bill.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.800
Do what?

11:43.900 --> 11:46.400
Hold it out like Raff
and we'll see how old you are.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
Oooh.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.200
<i>No, let's have it right.</i>

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
You trying to mug me off?

11:56.200 --> 11:59.300
Oh, shut up.
I'm only fuckin' about an' that.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.000
<i>- What d'you mean, "fuckin' about"?
- What?</i>

12:02.200 --> 12:03.500
What d'you mean, "what"?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.500
You know, just...

12:05.700 --> 12:07.600
Well, don't fuckin' just.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.100
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.400
<i>Ain't trying to wind anyone up.</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:15.100
I'm fuckin' serious.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.600
What I want to know is, what makes you think
you can come in here

12:18.700 --> 12:20.300
<i>and mug me off in front of my pals?</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:26.000
I... I didn't mean nothing by it, Bill.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.100
It was only a bubble, that's all.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.700
Just a bubble?

12:32.700 --> 12:37.000
What you talking to me
in that fuckin' muggy rhyming slang for?

12:37.300 --> 12:39.400
I never fuckin' liked you, you little cunt.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.800
<i>You're a wrong 'un,
just like your old man.</i>

12:41.900 --> 12:43.700
<i>He was a degenerate fuckin' drunk.</i>

12:43.800 --> 12:45.200
<i>Do you know what I'm thinking?</i>

12:45.400 --> 12:48.000
<i>I'm thinking I should take you outside
and open you up.</i>

12:48.200 --> 12:50.300
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin' out?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.600
What, d'you wanna get
involved an' all, do you?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.100
Don't be stupid.
I'm just saying, he's only a kid.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.000
<i>No, let's have it right, Tom.</i>

12:57.200 --> 13:00.900
<i>If he's old enough to run round givin' it large,
fuckin' bashing people up with us,</i>

13:01.100 --> 13:03.100
he's old enough to talk for himself.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.400
I'll tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.200
<i>I think I should take you outside
and teach you a lesson</i>

13:12.400 --> 13:16.200
for mugging me off and making me look a cunt
in front of my fuckin' pals.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.700
I...

13:18.700 --> 13:20.600
I didn't say nothing.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.300
Come on, outside,
you little fuckin' stumblebum.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.800
Leave it out, eh?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.400
Stop mutterin' and stutterin'
and fuckin' liven yourself up.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.900
I fuckin' had you there!

13:38.600 --> 13:41.900
Fuckin' hell, Zeb,
you should have seen your fuckin' face.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.500
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.800
What is it, four, five...
eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
There'll be none of this in Australia.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.300
As of next week, strictly the amber nectar.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.000
Not to worry, William.
I think I'm more of a cocktail man anyway.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.000
Well, I won't be sitting next to you.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.400
Well, that was the idea.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.900
Bill, Albert, I didn't see you there. Wanna pint?

14:06.200 --> 14:07.900
<i>My grandad didn't like Bright.</i>

14:08.100 --> 14:09.100
<i>Knew he was a bully.</i>

14:09.300 --> 14:12.600
<i>Bill and Albert were just kids
when they did their National Service.</i>

14:12.700 --> 14:16.700
<i>They were one of the first off the landing crafts
on June 6th.</i>

14:17.000 --> 14:21.500
<i>Bill aways told me the only thing that kept him
going was Albert's determination and will to live.</i>

14:21.800 --> 14:23.600
<i>They came home proud war heroes</i>

14:23.700 --> 14:26.000
<i>and married their childhood sweethearts.</i>

14:26.200 --> 14:28.100
<i>And buried 'em together as well.</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:33.400
<i>The council moved Albert to the flat above Bill
and they swapped door keys,</i>

14:33.600 --> 14:35.700
<i>always vowing to keep an eye on each other.</i>

14:35.900 --> 14:38.200
Very funny. Very, very funny!

14:39.400 --> 14:41.000
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.600
Now a little one. Now a little one.
That's it, now let me get the door.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.400
Let me get the door. I'll be right in there.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.100
Comfy? Do you want any help with that?

14:53.400 --> 14:56.400
<i>Bet you've seen some changes,
eh, you two? Yeah.</i>

14:56.700 --> 14:59.400
Bit different nowadays, though, innit, eh? Gone.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.900
It's the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything. Spoilt it.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.000
And what you got now, eh? What you got now?

15:07.200 --> 15:09.000
Fuckin' asylum seekers.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.900
Bloody Tony fuckin' Blair.
He's gotta be a poof, ain't he? New Labour?

15:13.100 --> 15:15.200
<i>I mean, and this game's gone.</i>

15:15.400 --> 15:19.600
There was a time I used to be able to clear
seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.200
Not any more. Nah.

15:21.300 --> 15:25.800
Now what you got is your fuckin' spades
up in Soho moonlighting!

15:26.100 --> 15:27.200
Moonlighting!

15:27.400 --> 15:30.300
Fuck's sake, that's a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!

15:30.500 --> 15:34.300
This country was built on
good people like yourselves.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.700
Not enough of you about, that's what I say.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.700
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.100
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That's it, lovely.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.900
And I just want to say, it's been a privilege
to drive two gentlemen like you.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.800
And the fare's on me.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.500
Don't be silly.
You're letting the wheelchair fool you.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.500
No, I insist.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.200
<i>It's been an honour.</i>

15:58.500 --> 16:01.400
Don't forget, you watch
out for them darkies, eh?

16:05.600 --> 16:07.500
What a wanker.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.200
Let's go dancing.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.500
<i>Although he talked a lot of bollocks,
in some ways the cabbie was right.</i>

16:18.700 --> 16:21.800
<i>Bill was what put the Great into Britain.
He was an old war hero.</i>

16:22.000 --> 16:25.200
<i>But he'd moved on.
It was Australia for him and Albert now.</i>

16:25.400 --> 16:28.900
<i>Somewhere they could live out
the rest of their days in the sun.</i>

16:36.200 --> 16:38.100
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.900
How are you?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.800
Course we have. Ain't you gonna say goodbye?

16:55.300 --> 16:56.700
Can't you do better than that.?

16:56.900 --> 16:58.600
What are you talking about, Bill?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.100
Don't you know?

17:00.700 --> 17:03.100
You fucking disgusting old man!

17:03.300 --> 17:05.099
<i>That's what I loved about Bill.</i>

17:05.300 --> 17:06.900
<i>He was still game.</i>

17:07.099 --> 17:10.400
<i>He'd dreamed about. Living abroad for years
and how his time had come.</i>

17:10.599 --> 17:13.599
<i>I even give him and Albert a little treat
for going away.</i>

17:15.000 --> 17:17.900
My grandson gave me a going-away present.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.900
A joint of his very best home-grown.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.200
You mean drugs?

17:24.400 --> 17:27.500
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I'll make do with this.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.300
<i>It's amazing to think in a couple of weeks</i>

17:34.500 --> 17:37.600
we'll be watching the sun go down
on the other side of the world.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.800
And it won't be surrounded by tower blocks.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.400
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.900
You packed yet?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.400
Haven't given it a thought.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.300
My case has been packed
and sitting inside the front door for three days.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.400
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.300
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.300
<i>- You know what Bert?
- What's that?</i>

18:17.700 --> 18:20.000
I'm feeling dizzy.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.500
<i>You always were, you dozy bastard!</i>

19:05.600 --> 19:07.700
<i>The next best thing to violence is sex,</i>

19:07.900 --> 19:10.700
<i>and seeing as there's
nearly 500,000 single women in London,</i>

19:10.800 --> 19:12.500
<i>I must be in with half a chance.</i>

19:12.700 --> 19:15.500
<i>Especially as I'd fuck
anything that's breathing.</i>

19:17.600 --> 19:20.600
I tell you, I'm fuckin' mullered, me.
I am fuckin' mullered.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.500
Look at the fuckin' boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin' helmet.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.200
No, no, no, Tom. Proper fuckin' slosh pots.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
Shut up, you... What's the matter with you?

19:33.500 --> 19:36.800
All right, sweetheart? You all right, girl, yeah?

19:37.100 --> 19:38.700
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?

19:40.300 --> 19:41.400
<i>A few tequilas?</i>

19:41.500 --> 19:43.400
A couple of little
cheeky tequilas, yeah?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
<i>Shall we get on it?</i>

19:45.600 --> 19:48.300
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.800
<i>Get these two birds here
a couple of tequilas.</i>

19:50.800 --> 19:53.800
I'm gonna smash the fuckin'
granny out of that.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
<i>London's changed for the worse.</i>

20:13.300 --> 20:16.200
All the good people, right,
all the good people...

20:16.500 --> 20:20.500
are being forced into the suburbs,
due to the influx of illegal immigrants

20:20.600 --> 20:23.100
forcing their way into this country.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.900
<i>- I mean...
- Hey, mate.</i>

20:25.100 --> 20:27.300
Mate, will you shut your fuckin' noise?

20:59.500 --> 21:02.600
Here you are, sloppy bollocks.
You fuckin' cunt.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.700
Get up there, girl. Get up there.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.200
I cannot wait to fuckin' see your fanny.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.800
I'm gonna fuckin' ruin you...
- Let's have a butcher's here. Rod, look.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.800
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Beautiful, beautiful.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.600
He's only fallen asleep, Tameka.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.700
Same here, Shian. Little fuckers.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.200
Good for you. I've got a stickleback in here.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.100
You fuckin' little mug!

21:46.300 --> 21:48.900
How dare you come into my fuckin' gaff,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
and try and get hold of my little sister
against her will?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.700
You're in bandit country now, boy,

21:54.900 --> 21:57.000
no-one will even know you were fuckin' here.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.700
There's holes dug all over South London
for people like you.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.400
<i>Jesus.
I was expecting cornflakes and a quick wank.</i>

22:08.600 --> 22:12.300
<i>But instead, I get some nutter
in a Stone Island jumper and a blade in my face.</i>

22:12.500 --> 22:15.700
<i>And worst of all,
that was where all the trouble started.</i>

22:19.400 --> 22:21.900
Oi, silly bollocks. What are these?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.100
What?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.100
- What are they?
- Flowers.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.800
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.100
Then what are they doing
with the chrysanths?

22:31.300 --> 22:33.600
All right. Sorry.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
- What?
- Er... there's someone here to see you, Bill.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.000
Who?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.400
<i>...the back door.
Left her watching Blind Date.</i>

22:42.500 --> 22:45.400
<i>Marched on up to The Venus
and bumped into Sonny.</i>

22:45.600 --> 22:46.900
<i>He's given me a couple of Es.</i>

22:47.100 --> 22:48.700
<i>I've had them with a bit more thingy,</i>

22:48.800 --> 22:51.600
and wound up copping for two slosh pots
out of Chigwell.

22:51.700 --> 22:55.800
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em
in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.

22:56.100 --> 23:00.100
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday
roast, but I was completely fuckin' anninilated.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.600
Look, I've got to go, mate. My man's here.
Ta-da.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.500
Good to see you, son.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.300
<i>- How are you? All right?
- Not bad.</i>

23:06.500 --> 23:09.700
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout
at Tottenham at the weekend.

23:09.900 --> 23:13.700
You ain't wrong. Heard you Millwall boys
had a little turnout down in Pompey.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.600
We did. We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.700
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.900
Your time'll come. What have you got for me?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.200
<i>One thing I never understood about Bright was,</i>

23:23.400 --> 23:27.200
<i>although he was in the Chelsea firm,
he did business with the head of their rivals.</i>

23:27.400 --> 23:28.300
<i>Millwall.</i>

23:28.500 --> 23:30.300
<i>Get that. Two men that work together,</i>

23:30.400 --> 23:33.200
<i>then kick fuck out of each other
if ever they get the chance.</i>

23:33.500 --> 23:35.100
It's bang on. What you got round you?

23:35.200 --> 23:37.000
Four K.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.400
- Go on, then. I'll take the lot.
- Cash.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.200
Hang on.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.700
<i>Hang on.</i>

23:46.900 --> 23:48.500
Slow down.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.700
What? You're fuckin' joking!

23:55.700 --> 23:57.700
All right.
I'll go straight up the hospital.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.400
<i>Yeah ' see you there.</i>

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
<i>- Problem, Fred?
- It's my brother, Terry.</i>

24:01.800 --> 24:05.100
Someone's just done him round the canister
with a cricket bat.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.000
You're fuckin' joking?
Is he all right?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.500
They don't know yet.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.800
Look, I gotta go.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.500
- I'll keep this lot on ice for you.
- I'll call you later.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.500
Oi! What are you fuckin' doing?
You're three hours late.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.500
Don't start, mate. I've had a bit of ag.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.800
What you got a sheet on for?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.200
You don't wanna know.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.100
You're right, I don't.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.400
They're putting lilies
in with the chrysanths.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.100
You got anything on under there?

24:42.700 --> 24:45.400
<i>What am I fuckin'paying for?
Just get on with it</i>

25:00.900 --> 25:03.600
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.300
Are you fuckin' mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.300
It's iron's gear.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.400
Get your fuckin' skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.000
Horrible cunt.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.900
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?

25:22.100 --> 25:24.100
Oh, there'll be tellies where we're going.

25:24.300 --> 25:28.500
<i>Oi, Zeb, try and make sure we've got
a decent house to rob this time, will you?</i>

25:28.800 --> 25:30.500
<i>I don't want to watch some piece of shit.</i>

25:30.700 --> 25:34.600
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh? What's
the matter with you? Are you a fuckin' Hoover?

25:34.800 --> 25:37.500
<i>Whether we were thieving,
fucking or fighting tonight,</i>

25:37.600 --> 25:40.800
<i>we'd a be glued to a TV set
to see who Chelsea drew in the Cup.</i>

25:41.000 --> 25:43.600
<i>See, the beauty of the Cup draw is,
it's a lucky dip,</i>

25:43.800 --> 25:47.000
<i>a chance to meet one of the old rivals,
like Cardiff or West Ham,</i>

25:47.200 --> 25:49.000
<i>or if you're really lucky, Millwall.</i>

25:49.100 --> 25:50.900
<i>And cos the draw meant so much to Billy,</i>

25:51.100 --> 25:55.900
<i>he decided to take his long-suffering wife
Barbara out for a quiet, romantic meal.</i>

25:56.200 --> 25:58.200
<i>However, they got their wires crossed,</i>

25:58.300 --> 26:01.400
<i>cos Barbara thought he was taking her
up the West End for some tapas.</i>

26:01.600 --> 26:03.000
Let's see what's on the menu.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.100
<i>Oi, it's my sister!</i>

26:16.900 --> 26:18.500
<i>Oh, what, your girfriend?</i>

26:20.200 --> 26:21.300
Oi.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.500
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there
to hold their noise down.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.100
Calm down, Bill.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.300
We don't want to cause a scene.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.800
No. No, you're right.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.600
<i>- The old rubber glove!
- The old rubber glove, mate.</i>

27:06.900 --> 27:07.800
Oi!

27:08.000 --> 27:11.800
Oi. Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the fuckin' telly!

27:14.900 --> 27:16.500
<i>...against 52.</i>

27:16.700 --> 27:18.300
<i>Southend United.</i>

27:18.500 --> 27:20.000
<i>57.</i>

27:21.400 --> 27:22.900
<i>Portsmouth.</i>

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
<i>Will pay number 38.</i>

27:25.000 --> 27:26.900
<i>Middlesbrough.</i>

27:27.100 --> 27:28.400
<i>Number 22.</i>

27:29.600 --> 27:30.700
<i>Millwall.</i>

27:30.900 --> 27:32.500
<i>Will pay 44.</i>

27:33.700 --> 27:34.600
<i>Chelsea.</i>

27:34.700 --> 27:37.300
Yes! Fuckin' yes!

27:37.500 --> 27:39.700
<i>Another battle then.</i>

27:39.800 --> 27:43.200
Eh? Can't fuckin' hear you.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.400
Who is it, for fuck's sake?

27:46.500 --> 27:48.300
Eh?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.000
Yes!

27:50.200 --> 27:52.500
- Who, who, who?
- It's fuckin' Millwall!

27:52.700 --> 27:56.600
<i>Millwall-Chelsea.
Old enemies that always ends up in murders.</i>

27:56.700 --> 27:57.900
<i>Literally in my case,</i>

27:58.100 --> 28:00.900
<i>cos like a mug
I thought I'd get lucky in the same bar again.</i>

28:01.100 --> 28:04.100
<i>And I see my new mate again
who, of course, turns out to be Millwall.</i>

28:04.300 --> 28:08.000
<i>Maybe I should ask him if I fucked his sister,
seeing as I can't remember.</i>

28:10.800 --> 28:15.300
<i>If I'd listened to my instincts and laid low, none
of this mess would have happened but I didn't,</i>

28:15.600 --> 28:17.100
<i>and I only had myself to blame.</i>

28:17.100 --> 28:22.000
<i>And occasionally, and I do mean occasionally,
it would be nice to have Bright out with us.</i>

28:22.300 --> 28:25.300
<i>It's typicla that tonight
he's taken his wife out for a quiet one.</i>

28:25.600 --> 28:27.800
<i>See? He does have a gentle side.</i>

28:28.000 --> 28:28.800
Aaaarghh!

28:28.900 --> 28:32.200
<i>Zeb and Raff missed the draw
cos they were doing what they do best -</i>

28:32.400 --> 28:35.900
<i>robbing houses,
something they'd later come to regret.</i>

28:37.100 --> 28:40.400
<i>Me, I'm beginning to get the feeling
old Magic Johnson's lost his touch.</i>

28:41.900 --> 28:45.100
Drive, mate! Fuckin' drive.
I'm being chased!

28:48.600 --> 28:50.400
<i>Lost his touch?</i>

28:50.600 --> 28:51.700
<i>Bollocks.</i>

28:52.900 --> 28:54.800
Hard to have a nice night out in London, eh?

28:56.100 --> 28:58.200
I blame all the black s and fun pubs, myself.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.000
<i>Shut up mate. You're boring.</i>

29:05.900 --> 29:08.700
<i>Welcome back to BBC London Sport
with me, Danny Kelly.</i>

29:08.800 --> 29:12.600
<i>Now, anyone who's listened to the Breakfast
Show will have heard Danny Baker going on</i>

29:12.900 --> 29:17.400
<i>about his great excitement about the prospects
of Millwall and Chelsea here in London.</i>

29:17.700 --> 29:19.600
<i>Our reporter, as always, is Pete Stevens.</i>

29:19.700 --> 29:23.000
<i>That's right, Danny. I'm sure
there's going to be a vast police presence</i>

29:23.300 --> 29:26.800
<i>to keep the we-known hooligan elements apart
from these two teams.</i>

29:27.000 --> 29:30.300
<i>I only hope I'm not given the job
of reporting live from South London.</i>

29:30.600 --> 29:34.200
<i>I'd much rather be watching the game
from the comfort of my front room.</i>

29:43.600 --> 29:48.000
Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We'll miss our flight.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.200
All right, Bill? You look pissed off.

30:59.300 --> 31:03.700
No, I'm not fuckin' all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.800
Hold that.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.300
<i>Suddenly,
going to Millwall weren't so appealing,</i>

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
<i>now I knew my enemies were part of their firm</i>

31:10.600 --> 31:13.600
<i>It's the one fuckin' place on earth
I didn't want to be caught out<./i></i>

31:13.800 --> 31:16.900
<i>Anyway, Liverpool away, and a chance
to have a good sleep on the coach.</i>

32:13.300 --> 32:14.200
Good, this.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.800
<i>- What did they nick, Bill?
- TV, DVD...</i>

32:19.000 --> 32:21.900
Even took the fuckin' kids' PlayStation
and my mobile.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.900
<i>- Your mobile?
- Yeah.</i>

32:25.000 --> 32:28.200
You know what to do?
Ring your number and see if they've still got it.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.900
That'll freak 'em out.
Tell them you know where they live and that.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.000
Good call, Rods.
I've got that Ride Of The Valkyries ring tone.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.400
You know, the war cry.
That'll fuckin' freak 'em out.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.700
Hello?

32:47.900 --> 32:50.100
You are fuckin' dead meat.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.900
I didn't know it was your house.
I didn't know it was your house!

32:59.100 --> 33:02.200
Look, I've got all the gear.
I've got the PlayStation.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.200
I'll shall fuckin' open you up!

33:17.200 --> 33:18.400
Fuck.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.800
Where are you from, mate?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.900
Just around.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.400
Are you fookin' Chelsea?

33:36.500 --> 33:37.900
Yeah.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.800
You flash cockney bastards.
Do you know Stanley?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.300
Run!

33:48.500 --> 33:50.100
Go on, run, you pair of rats.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
<i>Drive on again mate. Drive on.</i>

33:55.900 --> 33:59.600
Hey! Stop the fuckin' bus, you cunt!

34:03.900 --> 34:06.000
Fuckin' come on!

34:15.100 --> 34:17.600
Where the fuck are you running now?

34:19.100 --> 34:21.100
Cunts! Fuckin' cunts!

34:28.400 --> 34:30.000
Go on. Fuck off!

34:32.500 --> 34:35.600
Come here.
You didn't fuckin' shine there, did you, son?

34:35.800 --> 34:36.699
What?

34:36.800 --> 34:40.400
I've got to go to work on him now,
stop him opening you up.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.400
You silly bollocks.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.199
What was all that about?

34:45.300 --> 34:46.800
But we did 'em, didn't we, H?

34:46.800 --> 34:49.199
<i>Billy had a real punishmeht lined up
for Zeberdee.</i>

34:49.400 --> 34:53.300
<i>He weren't the forgiving type, but as long
as Harris was around, he couldn't touch him.</i>

34:53.400 --> 34:56.699
<i>And Harris and Billy
certainy didn't need another reason to fall out.</i>

35:17.200 --> 35:20.600
Right. No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.100
Just keep your nuts down.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.200
I want you to be outside and back on the road
in five minutes.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.700
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.300
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.900
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.500
He said we've got to get his gear back to him
by tomorrow.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.100
And we've got to apologise to his wife and kids.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.600
You've had a result there.
You're lucky. He could have battered you.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.400
Blinding result, eh?

35:48.500 --> 35:53.000
This complete nutter will never talk to us again,
and everyone think s we're thieving little cunts.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.400
<i>You are thieving little cunts.
But you know what you've got to do, don't you?</i>

35:57.700 --> 36:00.100
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That'll sort it out.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.800
Yeah, do the business down there,
and you'll be an hero in his eyes.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.600
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.700
I'll be opening bottles with my fuckin' teeth
all the way up there, Bill.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.800
Could have done with a couple of cans.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.900
Shouldn't have had that chicken burger.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.400
Stone me, it's them Stoke fans that done us.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.900
- Where?
- Over there. Look. It's them.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.900
<i>- It is them.
- It is an' all.</i>

36:47.100 --> 36:49.200
On the Rory, on the Rory, on the Rory.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.500
Listen. We'll get the beers safe.
Then we'll outflank 'em, yeah?

36:52.700 --> 36:54.700
I ain't saying a word.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.500
What the fuck are you doing?

36:56.700 --> 36:58.600
There's two of them Stoke fans that done us.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.000
Drop 'em now. We'll be late for the meet.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.300
Fuck 'em. They kicked the shit out of us.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.300
<i>No. The gavvers are over there.</i>

37:06.500 --> 37:07.700
<i>I'll give you fuckin' "no"!</i>

37:18.300 --> 37:20.200
Northern cunt!

37:26.200 --> 37:27.300
Fuckin' idiots.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.200
Slow down, you two, for fuck's sake!

37:33.400 --> 37:36.000
What, was you fuckin' bullied at school,
was you?

37:39.300 --> 37:41.700
Have fun, boys.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.700
Who are you fuckin' looking at?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.100
<i>Billy's extensive vocabulary
would never get him into Parliament.</i>

37:54.400 --> 37:58.200
<i>And this lot could be West Ham,
Cardiff, Arsenal, Stoken even Man United.</i>

37:58.400 --> 38:01.000
<i>Don't matter to me.
The odds don't look very good.</i>

38:11.300 --> 38:13.900
Know what? I think I'll call it a night. Tom?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.800
Yeah, let's go and have a beer.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.500
Yeah, good idea. We'll jog on.
What about you, Tom?

38:18.600 --> 38:21.500
All right, boys. I'll see you in a bit.
Order us some Miller.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.400
- Light?
- Er... regular.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.300
- No problem.
- See you later.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.400
You all right down there, mister?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.000
<i>What happened to you?</i>

39:20.100 --> 39:24.200
I've had the shit kicked out of me.
What about you?

39:25.300 --> 39:26.900
Me? I'm dead.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.500
Bill! Rod!

39:31.700 --> 39:34.000
Help! Where are you?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.700
Bill! Help!

39:38.700 --> 39:40.900
Fuckin' hell.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.300
Liven yourself up.
We're in court in half an hour.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.700
Court? What?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
Fuck... What about my dream?

39:48.000 --> 39:52.400
<i>What the fuck was that dream a about?
Who was the pikey kid with the bandaged face?</i>

39:52.700 --> 39:55.000
<i>Where was that tunnel? What did i all mean?</i>

39:55.200 --> 39:58.300
<i>Fuck it. Must be that nutty skunk again.</i>

39:58.500 --> 40:01.600
What's wrong with you, Bright?
You're 40 years old,

40:01.900 --> 40:04.500
<i>and still you offend persistently.</i>

40:04.700 --> 40:06.500
I see children with more common sense.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.300
<i>What did you say?</i>

40:08.400 --> 40:13.000
Don't you dare answer me with that
insolent tongue of yours, you fat fucking slob!

40:13.300 --> 40:17.200
<i>The Establishment call us chidren while
they're at King's Cross having sex with 'em.</i>

40:17.500 --> 40:20.200
<i>I should tell this old queer
to join us down at Millwall.</i>

40:20.400 --> 40:23.100
<i>He might enjoy swapping that silly wig
for having a row.</i>

40:23.300 --> 40:27.300
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. It won't happen
again, sir. You can be sure of that.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.700
I do hope that's the case, Mr Bright.
I'm passing this over for reports.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.500
<i>I'll see you in a month for sentence.</i>

40:32.700 --> 40:34.400
<i>- And Bright
- Yes, sir?</i>

40:34.600 --> 40:37.100
If you appear before me again before that date,

40:37.300 --> 40:41.100
<i>I won't hesitate to give you
a custodial sentence of a least five years...</i>

40:41.400 --> 40:44.300
<i>Why is it, while I'm having hightmares
about dead kids,</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:47.500
<i>Rod's slipping into the court clerk?
What's he got I'm missing?</i>

40:47.700 --> 40:50.400
<i>Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.</i>

40:50.600 --> 40:53.300
<i>And it's tricky
cos he's been known to get serious.</i>

41:05.400 --> 41:08.100
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.700
What's happening, Tom?

41:09.800 --> 41:14.800
Here. I got nicked with Bright the other day,
kicking off with the OB. You'd have loved it.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.900
Nice one, Tom. Sounds really clever.
It's not my scene any more.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.700
Yeah, well, I'm just saying.

41:21.900 --> 41:25.900
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don't
come down my stall giving it the big 'un.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.200
All right. Slow down, Ad.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.400
Slow down?
I'll tell you about fuckin' "slow down".

41:30.600 --> 41:34.700
What's the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain't it about time you started growing up?

41:35.000 --> 41:38.900
You're nearly 30. You wanna get hold
of yourself. It's all a lot of bollocks, anyway.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.600
- What?
- You're a bright kid. Work it out.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.400
- Here you are.
- No, they're from both of us.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.500
Tommy... think about it.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.200
<i>Nearly 30? What's he on about?</i>

42:05.400 --> 42:09.300
<i>Jesus! I only wanted a bunch of fuckin' flowers,
and he tells me to think about my life.</i>

42:24.200 --> 42:26.200
See you, Albert.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.100
What's Harris and Bright doing there?

42:46.300 --> 42:48.300
I could hardly stop them, Bill.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.200
They're foolish men, Tom.

42:51.500 --> 42:54.800
Harris think s we're connected
cos I fought in the war.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
What he doesn't understand is, I fought to stop
people like him with their Fascist opinions.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.200
Billy is a fuckin' idiot.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.700
Are you still going to Australia?

43:07.800 --> 43:11.700
I don't know. There's a spare ticket
going begging, if you're interested.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.800
Your cousins would love to see you.

43:17.400 --> 43:18.900
Do yourself a favour.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.900
Put a bit of distance between you
and all that stuff you're mixed up in.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.200
I'm all right, Bill.

43:27.400 --> 43:28.900
I'm just having a laugh.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.000
Well, just be careful.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Next time you visit the boneyard,
it could be in a box.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.500
What are you fuckin' doing here,
you little cunt?

44:06.700 --> 44:08.900
I've come to pay my respects.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.400
Well, you're not wanted.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.800
Let's have it right. You didn't even
fuckin' know him, did you? Did you?

44:17.800 --> 44:20.700
Well, put your soppy cap on,
then, and fuck off.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.100
Go on, jog on.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.200
Don't forget our appointment.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.900
All right, boys? What's happening?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.400
Why have you got a dartboard
drawn on your shirt, Zeb?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.900
Well, what's it got to do with you, you mug?

45:00.900 --> 45:03.100
All right, boys. First one to a hundred.

45:05.900 --> 45:07.000
Aaaarghh!

45:07.500 --> 45:09.200
Aaaarghh!

45:09.400 --> 45:11.600
Stand up straight.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.900
He wants to know
which one stole the PlayStation.

45:24.300 --> 45:25.300
Me.

45:28.400 --> 45:29.900
Good call. Crack on.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.800
Aaaarghh!

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.100
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.200
Just a kid, ain't you?

45:44.400 --> 45:47.800
<i>You hold your hand out, Zeb.
Let's see how old you are.</i>

45:48.000 --> 45:49.800
Are you trying to fuckin' mug me off?

45:58.500 --> 46:01.700
<i>With Millwall round the corner,
it was time for the juniors to play</i>

46:01.800 --> 46:04.800
<i>Nice to see Billy and Fred
could put their differences aside</i>

46:05.000 --> 46:07.100
<i>when it come to their kids.</i>

46:07.300 --> 46:11.600
Bit of a coincidence, eh? Our kids play against
each other just before we meet in the Cup.

46:11.900 --> 46:15.200
Somehow, I don't think this game's
gonna get quite as messy. Do you?

46:15.400 --> 46:17.300
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?

46:17.500 --> 46:20.800
Well, let's have it right.
If history's anything to go by,

46:21.100 --> 46:23.600
last time we met you lot,
we ran you all over London.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.600
You couldn't run 100 yards, mate!

46:25.800 --> 46:29.300
- Won't fuckin' need to, either!
- Don't get lemon, Bill. It don't suit you.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.800
Spell it, you cunt.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.700
C-U-N-T. Cunt.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.700
We'll see about lemon when you're lost
in deep south, you fat fuckin' prick.

46:39.900 --> 46:43.200
Whoa! Now we're getting personal.
Now, what's your problem?

46:43.500 --> 46:47.000
That you have to open your kebab shop soon
or that you buy Charlie off a white man?

46:47.200 --> 46:52.500
Well, how does it feel doing business with
a Turk, when you're supposed to be right wing?

46:52.800 --> 46:54.500
Scooby-Do's less confused than you.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.900
You'll be confused when I open your canister up.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.200
You wanna wait till the game or make one now?

46:59.300 --> 47:02.500
Don't punch above your weight,
you long streak of piss.

47:02.700 --> 47:05.400
Well, stop punching your old woman about,
then, wanker.

47:05.700 --> 47:07.200
What did you fuckin' say, you mug?

47:07.300 --> 47:09.800
You fuckin' heard, you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.800
Fuckin' mug! Look at you, you cunt!

47:13.100 --> 47:15.700
Get off me, you... Get off me, you cunt!

47:20.000 --> 47:22.200
Fuck this. If they can't be grown up, let's go.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.000
I'll fuckin' do you!

47:36.300 --> 47:39.400
<i>Just as I thought.
Rod's been plating the court clerk's Gary,</i>

47:39.500 --> 47:41.900
<i>and now she wants to meet his mates.</i>

47:42.000 --> 47:46.600
<i>I told him I already met her in the dock,
but he insisted on a social one.</i>

47:46.800 --> 47:51.300
<i>And why is it that when your best mate meets
a girl, he quickly changes into a fuckin' melt,</i>

47:51.600 --> 47:54.700
<i>and acts like
he's only known you for ten minutes?</i>

47:54.900 --> 47:58.600
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?

47:58.900 --> 48:01.900
<i>Thomas?
Kick people's fuckin' heads in for a laugh.</i>

48:02.100 --> 48:04.400
<i>And you shoud know, div.
You read the charges out.</i>

48:04.600 --> 48:06.400
Me?

48:06.600 --> 48:08.400
I work long and hard.

48:10.900 --> 48:13.900
Sounds like Rod!

48:16.800 --> 48:19.100
<i>- Yeah?</i>

48:24.200 --> 48:25.100
Cor...

48:25.200 --> 48:28.300
<i>Jesus, he's really picked one here.
The worst sort of all.</i>

48:28.600 --> 48:32.900
<i>Wannabe middle-class scum.
I'd like to kick the cunt back to Penge.</i>

48:33.200 --> 48:34.500
Seems nice.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.800
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a top bloke.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.800
Bill, it's Tom. Fancy a quiet drink?
I'm bored out of my skull.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.900
Meet me at work around seven in the morning.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.100
Don't worry. I'll bring my tools.

48:46.700 --> 48:49.500
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.

49:04.300 --> 49:05.600
Johnson!

49:06.500 --> 49:07.700
Johnson!

49:07.900 --> 49:12.200
All right, Billy. What's it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?

49:12.300 --> 49:15.400
No, forget that and just crack straight on
with the blow job, eh?

49:16.500 --> 49:19.800
Stone me, she won't be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.400
- What do you think?
- Good boy.

49:21.600 --> 49:25.100
<i>What do you think the screaming was about?
I'm having a fuckin' breakdown.</i>

49:25.400 --> 49:30.100
<i>With my back against the wall there was
only one thing for it - seek counsle from Bright.</i>

49:30.400 --> 49:32.200
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?

49:33.400 --> 49:35.500
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.800
It's just er... I keep...

49:41.000 --> 49:43.500
I dunno. I just keep... You know?

49:44.700 --> 49:46.400
Yeah, yeah, I know.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.900
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, I know.</i>

49:52.400 --> 49:54.400
Fuck! Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.

49:56.700 --> 49:59.300
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.600
No, don't worry about it. It's sweet.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.400
Don't worry. I'm gonna sort you out.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.600
Thank s, Bill.
You're a fuckin' good man.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.200
Listen. Don't mention it.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.500
<i>- Here you are.
- What?</i>

50:10.700 --> 50:12.200
<i>Go on son. Crack on. Go on.</i>

50:21.100 --> 50:22.500
Enjoy!

50:24.700 --> 50:26.600
<i>Should have seen that one coming.</i>

50:26.800 --> 50:29.900
<i>The last person on earth you want to talk to
when you're paranoid</i>

50:30.100 --> 50:32.800
<i>Ask Bright for advice, and
you get fuckin' Viagra.</i>

51:08.400 --> 51:10.600
<i>And what a good mate he was
in my time of need.</i>

51:10.800 --> 51:14.200
<i>Fuckin' fat little cunt
lazing about with his Penge minge.</i>

51:14.400 --> 51:15.500
Wake up, sleepy.

51:16.700 --> 51:18.800
That was my parents on the phone.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.800
They're coming to London at the weekend
and want to take us out.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.600
Well, as long as it ain't Saturday.
We got Millwall.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.500
It is Saturday, Rod.

51:34.100 --> 51:35.700
What about Sunday?

51:35.900 --> 51:40.200
They're going to my brother's in Reading.
Don't tell me you'd rather go to football.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.800
Well, I am male.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.900
It's one game.

51:44.100 --> 51:45.600
I am male.

51:45.700 --> 51:48.100
But my parents only come round
once every few months.

51:48.300 --> 51:51.000
Yeah, Millwall comes round
less than the eclipse, babe.

51:52.100 --> 51:53.600
Well, don't just run out.

51:53.700 --> 51:56.900
<i>- I'm going to work.
- Let's talk about it, eh?</i>

51:57.100 --> 51:58.500
There's nothing to talk about.

51:58.700 --> 52:02.000
<i>You either meet my parents on Saturday
or you never meet them.</i>

52:20.200 --> 52:21.600
All right, boys?

52:22.700 --> 52:25.100
Yeah. Sweet. Speak to you later.

52:29.300 --> 52:31.300
Fuck off.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.400
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need? Whites or browns?

52:41.700 --> 52:43.700
Hit him, hit him! Hit the cunt.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.600
Come here.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

52:49.600 --> 52:52.900
Grab the fuckin' rock.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.000
Cunt!

52:59.100 --> 53:00.600
Come on!

53:11.000 --> 53:13.900
- Fuckin' hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.

53:14.100 --> 53:15.600
Come, let's go.

54:15.100 --> 54:18.000
<i>My grandad's life
was disappearing in front of his eyes.</i>

54:18.200 --> 54:22.800
<i>With Albert dead, he had no-one, apart from me,
so it was time to give him some family support,</i>

54:23.100 --> 54:25.500
<i>and maybe even some friendly advice.</i>

54:25.700 --> 54:29.400
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That'll liven you up a bit.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.500
You all right for money, Bill?

54:38.700 --> 54:40.900
<i>Cos you know you've only got to ask.</i>

54:41.000 --> 54:43.400
<i>I'm earning a few quid down the market now.</i>

54:43.600 --> 54:45.300
It ain't as if I got a bird to spend it on.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.600
Unlike Rod.

54:48.100 --> 54:50.000
You sound over the moon about that.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.700
Yeah, well...

54:54.000 --> 54:55.700
Your chance'll come.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.600
Don't you ever get the itch?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.500
Yeah.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.200
I can see myself on a sun lounger
in my back garden,

55:09.300 --> 55:11.700
a couple of kids running about...

55:11.900 --> 55:13.800
sipping my Pimm's quietly.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.300
Kids, eh?

55:16.400 --> 55:17.700
Yeah. Why not?

55:18.800 --> 55:20.100
What's their names?

55:20.300 --> 55:23.400
Dorian, after my mate.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.000
Dorian?

55:26.200 --> 55:28.100
<i>Both of them?</i>

55:28.300 --> 55:29.300
Yeah, probably.

55:29.300 --> 55:30.900
What if they're girls?

55:34.200 --> 55:35.100
Dorian.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.800
You're a good boy, Tom.

55:41.100 --> 55:42.600
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.600
I'm going to the toilet.

56:03.300 --> 56:04.500
I tell you what, Fred.

56:04.700 --> 56:07.500
<i>This area beats South London hands down.</i>

56:08.700 --> 56:12.000
Bollocks, does it.
I'll have Bermondsey any day.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.700
It's full of spivs and skint hoorays round here.

56:16.900 --> 56:19.900
I just wanna find this fuckin' Tommy Johnson
and get out of here.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.800
Let's just cut him and fuck off back over south.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.600
<i>You're not wrong.</i>

56:27.100 --> 56:29.500
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.600
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin' you. Come here.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.000
Come on.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.900
Ever heard of a geezer
called Tommy Johnson?

56:44.300 --> 56:45.800
Johnson...

56:47.100 --> 56:48.600
Johnson...

56:50.900 --> 56:52.400
No, I've never heard of him, mate.

56:52.600 --> 56:53.900
Yeah?

56:54.000 --> 56:55.300
Yeah.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.900
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

56:59.600 --> 57:01.700
- What?
- I said, what's your fuckin' name?

57:04.500 --> 57:05.400
Dorian.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.100
Poof!

57:08.200 --> 57:11.800
Dorian? Sounds like a fuckin' poof.

57:12.100 --> 57:13.900
Yeah, I know.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.400
Just a name, though, innit?

57:15.600 --> 57:16.900
Prove it.

57:19.000 --> 57:19.900
Prove what?

57:20.100 --> 57:22.400
Stop fuckin' stuttering,
and fuckin' prove it.

57:22.600 --> 57:24.600
Just show him some fuckin' brief.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.200
Er...

57:28.600 --> 57:30.600
I ain't got my wallet on me, mate.

57:35.300 --> 57:38.100
Go on, then. Fuck off, you mug. Go on.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.100
Hang on.

57:43.600 --> 57:46.800
<i>We'll see who the fuck you really are.
Give us your phone.</i>

57:53.800 --> 57:55.200
<i>Who's this?</i>

57:55.400 --> 57:57.600
<i>Hello. It's Rod. Is Dorian there?</i>

58:00.900 --> 58:03.500
You've had a fuckin' touch. Little mug.

58:03.700 --> 58:05.500
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

58:15.900 --> 58:18.100
Do you reckon he's somewhere else?

58:18.300 --> 58:21.000
We'll try the other gaff.
He's got to be here somewhere.

58:37.400 --> 58:39.300
<i>Fuckin' hell! Did your arse drop, son?</i>

58:39.500 --> 58:42.100
You'd fuckin' think so! I tell you.

58:42.300 --> 58:46.300
The moment I seen them follow you in,
I knew you'd give them a dodgy name.

58:46.500 --> 58:48.600
It's a little trick we picked up in the army.

58:48.800 --> 58:51.800
I'm definitely calling my kids Dorian now.
Dorian.

58:52.100 --> 58:53.600
<i>- Dorian.
- Dorian.</i>

58:54.900 --> 58:57.700
See you, Rodder,
I fuckin' love you sometimes. Do you know that?

58:57.900 --> 59:00.200
You ain't too bad yourself, Johnson.

59:00.400 --> 59:03.500
I'm well up for it now.
The omens are good. Millwall who?

59:03.600 --> 59:06.000
<i>I'm gonna have a right
fuckin' buzz down there.</i>

59:07.200 --> 59:08.200
Yeah.

59:10.400 --> 59:11.900
<i>Don't say it, Rod.</i>

59:13.100 --> 59:14.700
What?

59:14.900 --> 59:16.300
You fuckin' know.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.800
Look, Tom, fuckin'...
Her mum and dad are coming down.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Tom, you'll need these
where you're going.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.900
How you doing, mister?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.500
Nah. Not good. You?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.200
Still dead.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.100
Sorry about that. Am I?

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.500
No, you're still alive.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.600
<i>- Who are you, mate?
- Don't know mate.</i>

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.100
Can't tell till I
take these bandages off.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.000
What?

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.100
What do you mean, "what"?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.900
What are you looking at me like that for?

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.800
You don't know?

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300
What, Rod?

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.700
You don't remember what
you done last night?

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.600
I was fuckin' lashed, wasn't I?

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:13.500
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer
with you and my grandad.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.400
Jesus, Tom...

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.000
For fuck's sake, Rod, what's so bad?

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.600
You don't remember Barbara?

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.600
Barbara who?

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.900
You tried to get off
with Billy's wife.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.900
Fuck off.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.100
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.500
- What?
- You broke her fuckin' jaw, Tom.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.600
I know you're winding me up, Rod.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.300
Please tell me you're winding me up, Rod.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.100
I ain't, mate.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.900
Fuck off, King. I tell you what.
I'll ring Zeb. He'll fuckin' know.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.400
All right, Zeb?

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.700
Fuckin' hell, Tom. I don't know what to say.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.700
<i>You went berserk mate.</i>

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.900
<i>I've got to wash my hands of this one.
The cunt's been playing darts with me.</i>

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.000
What am I gonna do, Rod?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.100
You're gonna have to go round there.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.900
What?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.100
Just go round there and fuckin' beg.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.900
Well, that's a good idea. I might as well
break her fuckin' nose while I'm at it.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.500
I don't know what else to say to you, Tom.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.400
No, you're right. I'II...

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.900
I'll fling myself on my knees
and let him kick the fuck out of me.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.600
Hopefully,
he'll have mercy on me if I'm on the floor.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.300
You know him better than me, mate.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.800
That's the problem. I know what he'll do.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.700
Johnson.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.100
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don't remember nothing.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.100
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I've woke up...

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.500
I'm none the wiser, Bill. Please, Bill.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.000
<i>I don't know what's gone on, mate
swear to you. Please Bill. Please.</i>

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.600
My life.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:51.100
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can't fuckin' believe you fell for that!

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.200
If you'd touched my woman,
you'd already be dead!

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.100
Fuckin' arseholes.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.600
<i>Fuckin' funny, that, innit?</i>

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.100
Go on. Have a fuckin' laugh, will you?
Go on. Really fuckin'...

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.400
I really fuckin' need this at the moment,

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.700
what with my dreams,
fuckin' florists, fuckin' billboards...

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.900
Bollocks!

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.100
Cunts.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.800
On his fuckin' knees!

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
<i>With mates like mine
you certainly don't need enemies. Jesus.</i>

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.300
<i>Three weeks ago, I was getting on with my life.</i>

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.400
<i>But now, with Millwall round the corner,
I'm half the man I was, which ain't saying much.</i>

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.600
<i>And the worst is yet to come.</i>

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.400
<i>Here's Mark with the sport.</i>

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.600
<i>Well, the third round takes place this Saturday,</i>

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.100
<i>and of course the pick of the ties
has got to be Chelsea against Millwall.</i>

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.700
<i>I know police leave
is cancelled, but this goes beyond that.</i>

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.400
<i>This is that ancient rivalry...</i>

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.800
Hello, Bill.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.300
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.800
- How's your luck?
- Not bad, Billy. How are you?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.100
<i>Right. Same as before.</i>

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.700
I'll take some of you lot
down through South Bermondsey,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.400
and Tommy will take the
rest from Surrey Quays.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.000
Where's the meet?

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.600
It can't be too far away.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.700
They'll have spotters out all over the place.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.900
<i>- And it's on top of the Old Bill before we start.
- What about Billy?</i>

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.400
What about Billy?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.300
He knows Millwall like the back of his hand.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500
Fuck Billy.
He don't know what he's doing any more.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.100
Now, let's have it right.
We all know he's become a liability.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.800
<i>Granted, yeah he can have a row.</i>

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.100
But he can't run a turnout
down in South London.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.300
<i>He's a fuckin' lunatic.
Look what happened in Liverpool.</i>

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.900
Bollocksed the day up.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.400
His problem is,
he's taken too much of that shit up his nose.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.700
Just forget him.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.400
Slow down. He's one of your own.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.600
<i>Hang on. You've got to make Harris right here.</i>

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.800
It's like having a big kid around.
He's a fuckin' dope, mate.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.200
<i>Just let him take Zeberdee
and those chavvies. That'll do him.</i>

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.400
<i>You just wipe your mouth of him.</i>

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.200
He's a spent force.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.800
<i>Bill...</i>

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.000
<i>Bill!</i>

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.000
What's the matter, babe?

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.600
You think I'm all right, don't you?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.900
What?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.500
I'm all right, aren't I?

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.600
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.800
Come here.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.800
Eat your dinner.

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:21.300
Bright!

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.500
Don't fuckin' creep up
on me like that, you si!

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.100
Bill. Take it easy.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.400
How comes you weren't down the pub
last night?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.100
Fell asleep, didn't I?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.600
<i>How comes you know I weren't there?</i>

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.600
Harris belled me and asked where you were.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.400
<i>Well, he didn't fuckin' bell me.
Maybe he forgot, eh?</i>

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.200
<i>- Got it?
- Fuck me! What's that for?</i>

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.700
Millwall.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.600
Don't be stupid.
You can't take a gun down there.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.200
- It's only a flare gun.
- What are you on about? You'll kill someone.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
<i>Meant to be having a laugh aren't we?</i>

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.400
Fuckin' hell, Bill.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.100
You're on the turn, ain't you?

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.600
<i>- You ain't got nothing to prove.
- Ain't I?</i>

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.100
You look as handsome
as you did on our wedding day.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.500
<i>Where are your medals?</i>

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.899
You can't go to Whitehall without them, dear.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.100
<i>You're a hero William.
Go and put them on dear.</i>

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.100
Make me the proudest woman alive.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.800
Don't look at me.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.200
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you Pakis.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:41.500
Fuck off!

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.700
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.200
I know, I know, I know.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.100
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.800
You don't even know you're fuckin' born!

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.700
Oh, fuck off.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.600
Go on, fuck off, you old mug!

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.700
I know who I am now.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.600
Show me, then.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600
All right, for fuck's sake.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.000
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It's Millwall today.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700
You all right?

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.700
I'm sweet, mate. I'm fuckin' buzzing.
This is it.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.700
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Listen, Zeb. Listen, listen.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.700
You... You'd better just...

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.300
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.500
Just look after yourself. It might turn ugly.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.700
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be a fuckin' hero.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.200
Liven up, we've got to meet the others.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.500
I tell you, it's a fuckin' buzz! Come on!

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.100
Here, Tom, where's Rod?

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.700
Fuck knows. You all right?

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.600
Yeah. Couldn't sleep, could I? Fuckin' buzzing.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.900
<i>The wretch from Penge had got her claws in,
and only a miracle could bring him back.</i>

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.200
<i>But I couldn't see it happening.
I'd lost him when I needed him most.</i>

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.300
<i>And not even someone of Rod's calibre
woud have the bottle to say...</i>

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.900
That espresso's really kicked in.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.000
<i>Darling you don't drink espresso.</i>

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.400
Tell me more about the air conditioning,
Rodney. I'm fascinated.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.700
Air conditioning?

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.700
You told me you run an
air-conditioning firm.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:59.300
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once
most of the time.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.400
Well, it's always busier in the summer.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.900
Nothing like a soaring temperature
to help the work.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.800
Anyway, most of the time I just sit
around the office, waiting for the weekend.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.000
Don't get me wrong.
I love the money the job pays.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.600
But my real passion lies
in kicking people's fucking heads in at football.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.500
See, I've got to channel it somewhere,
and as you can tell by my bulging stomach,

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.300
I don't participate in too
many sporting activities.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.700
And I don't do drugs.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.800
Well, that's not entirely true, but not a lot.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.700
So, I need my release, and a good fuckin' fight
seems the best way. Wouldn't you agree?

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.600
<i>Maybe not</i>

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.400
At least I wouldn't be walking around like you -
fuckin' horrible cunts with sticks up your arses,

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:41.600
trying to pretend
your little suburban nightmare's all right.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.300
<i>Then again,
it just depends which way you look at it.</i>

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.600
Mate, can we have the...

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.000
No, I'll...

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.100
Rod! I fuckin' knew you'd make it!

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.300
Wouldn't miss it for the world, mate.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600
There's a fuckin' shot, man.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.200
You lot fuckin' ready for us, or what?

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.500
Well, let's see how game you really are.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.800
So, come and find us, then, shithead.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.400
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you're gonna be in deep south.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.300
Away from all the crowds and the ready eye.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.100
So, watch your fuckin' backs.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.800
<i>- Fuckin' hell!
- Let's have it!</i>

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.100
Hello, Tom.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.500
What's happening, Joe boy?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.100
Everything's sweet round here.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.500
- Where's Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.600
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.900
Later on. Bye.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.700
- Hello, Joe, son. Where are you?
- On the bridge. It's all quiet down here.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Keep your eyes peeled.
WeÂ´ll be there soon.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.800
<i>Give you a bell if I see anything.</i>

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.800
<i>- Crack on.
- Speak to you later.</i>

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.300
- Right. Here you are. It's sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.700
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.000
30 years I've stood
toe to toe with you.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.100
You fuckin' mug me off like that?

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.200
Forget it.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.500
Anyone who runs is gonna get
properly served up when we get home.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.300
You got it?

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.700
Are you all right, son, yeah?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.400
Yeah. Are you?

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.500
I've got to tell you now.
I've got a really bad fuckin' feeling about this.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.200
<i>Come on! For fuck's sake.</i>

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.700
Oi. Oi. Hold it here.
Hold it. Hold it.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.300
Hold it.
Oi. Keep your fuckin' voices down.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.300
Keep your fuckin' voices down.

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.900
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.100
Fuckin' wankers!

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.000
Fuck.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.800
Cunts!

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.000
You and your f...

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.700
<i>Clear the area.</i>

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.700
<i>Immediately.</i>

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.400
Fuckin' cunt!

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.700
<i>Disperse, immediately.</i>

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.400
<i>I repeat: disperse now.</i>

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
<i>Clear the area.</i>

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.800
Get him!

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.500
Step on the cunt!

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.900
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.500
Johnson! Johnson!
Leave my fuckin' brother in Casualty, you cunt?

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.700
Get the fuck back!

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.100
Get out of the way!

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.700
Leave it.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.100
You nearly wound up in
the boneyard, my son.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.100
How come you're here?

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.300
They call it grieving.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.900
I call it falling fuckin' over.

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.600
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.500
Was er... Zeberdee there?

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.200
Erm... young fella with black hair?

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.500
Thank fuck for that.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.000
What about Australia, Bill?

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.100
I'll fly next Tuesday.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.300
What about you?

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.800
What about me?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.700
Huh!

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.400
Was it worth it?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.600
<i>Kicked half to death,
florists, cabbies, nightmares and visions.</i>

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.700
<i>One of the old soldiers gone for ever.</i>

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.300
<i>Bright gone for a seven,</i>

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:39.100
<i>and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing
I'll be pulling for months is a chain.</i>

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.300
<i>After all that you really do
have to ask yourself if it was a worth it.</i>

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.400
<i>Course it fuckin' was.</i>

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.100
Yeah, just get a pint over here.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.300
They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced,
he started crying his eyes out.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.500
I'll do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.700
You corrupt cunt. It's people like you
that are ruining this fuckin' country, you nonce.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
<i>- Take him down.
- Fuckin' mug.</i>

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.800
Here you are.

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.300
- Where are you going, you slippery cunt?
- Khazi. He gave me a livener.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.500
Zeb, leave me some,
or you're fuckin' dead.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.800
What's happenin', Zeberfuckindee?
