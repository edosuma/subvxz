00:16.677 --> 00:19.278
- I need a hotdog.
- All right.

00:22.783 --> 00:25.117
Hey! Be liberal
with your withdrawal, eh!

00:25.185 --> 00:27.620
- Your buy-in is my car payment.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27.688 --> 00:30.889
(chuckles)

00:35.494 --> 00:38.329
Hey! How are you doing. Uh...
I'll have a sausage, please.

00:38.397 --> 00:40.331
- Yup!
- Thank you.

00:40.899 --> 00:44.335
You got whole-wheat buns?
You don't see that very often.

00:44.403 --> 00:48.338
Very nice! No corn relish,
though? No corn relish...

00:48.406 --> 00:51.609
Nobody has corn relish any more,
you ever notice that?

00:51.676 --> 00:54.778
(A phone rings.)

00:57.281 --> 00:59.216
There you go, Mr. Logan.
There's your cash.

00:59.283 --> 01:01.351
- Great. Thank you.
- Have a nice weekend.

01:01.419 --> 01:04.486
I will, you too.

01:21.370 --> 01:25.741
[Man, thinking to himself]: <i>I'm going to have to
call him</i> <i>later. I'm supposed to call him</i>

01:25.808 --> 01:28.010
(He hears people's
jumbled thoughts.)

01:48.095 --> 01:49.796
I'll help you
right over here.

02:01.042 --> 02:04.243
- Next please!
- Hi.

02:04.311 --> 02:05.710
[In a low voice]:

02:05.711 --> 02:06.979
Hey.

02:07.047 --> 02:08.981
Don't look at me, OK?
Don't react, all right?

02:09.049 --> 02:11.583
You got to call the police.
There are men in here with guns.

02:11.651 --> 02:14.086
[Whispering]: They're going
to rob the bank.

02:18.391 --> 02:21.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are being robbed.

02:21.827 --> 02:23.527
(screams)
Back away from the counter.

02:23.595 --> 02:26.864
Touch an alarm, you're dead!
Move! Come on, don't be scared.

02:26.932 --> 02:30.267
Let's go! Move nice
and orderly, single file.

02:31.835 --> 02:33.470
Right down through here, please.

02:33.538 --> 02:37.141
Let's go. You too,
right away. Let's go.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.609
Out to the middle of the floor,
that's right.

02:39.677 --> 02:42.179
Why are you waiting? Go!

02:44.048 --> 02:46.216
- Come on, let's go! Let's go!
- Move, move, move!

02:46.283 --> 02:49.853
Come on! Let's go!
Move! Let's go!

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:04.787 --> 03:05.936
Everybody on your knees.

03:05.937 --> 03:07.773
Two lines, right through here.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.808
Hands on your heads, come on!
(whimpers)

03:18.016 --> 03:20.785
Gonna be a hero today?

03:22.086 --> 03:25.222
Hey, listen. We're going to do what you
say and no one's going to fight you, OK?

03:25.790 --> 03:28.325
Who are you? Community
spokesman?

03:28.393 --> 03:30.394
We're going
to work with you,

03:30.461 --> 03:32.529
all right?
No one wants to get hurt.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.583
Too late, big boy.

03:35.651 --> 03:37.484
All right! Wallets, cell phones:

03:37.552 --> 03:40.119
- In the bag. Let's go!
- Trick or treat,

03:40.187 --> 03:43.156
- boys and girls! - All right, we got
six minutes and counting, boys.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.392
Get the drawers. Every third
stack of cash has a dye pack.

03:46.461 --> 03:49.329
Make sure you leave a bill in the twenties
slot so you don't set off any alarms.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.631
- Zip them.
- Yeah.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.666
You. Up on your feet,
you're gonna open the vault.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.969
- I can't... (The thief pretends to whimper.)
- Two seconds!

03:57.536 --> 04:00.172
Remember protocol. Just give them what
they want and no one'll get hurt.

04:00.239 --> 04:03.676
Finally somebody
making some sense.

04:04.243 --> 04:06.745
- Hands over your head.
- All right, OK.

04:24.496 --> 04:27.965
Hey, what's going on? Did they find
asbestos in there? Where are you?

04:28.032 --> 04:29.967
[On the walkie-talkie]:
<i>Come on, give me a reason,</i>

04:30.034 --> 04:33.269
<i>just a twitch and I'll blow</i>
<i>your head off!</i> <i>...OK!</i>

04:33.337 --> 04:36.172
Dispatch, this is Uni two-one.
- Go ahead, University two-one.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.174
Call 911. There's
an armed robbery in progress

04:38.242 --> 04:40.176
at the First Toronto Bank at the
corner of Carling and Spadina.

04:40.244 --> 04:42.177
They have hostages.
They have my partner.

04:42.245 --> 04:44.000
[Michelle McCluskey]:

04:44.045 --> 04:45.180
<i>So, it turns out</i>

04:45.248 --> 04:47.249
our forgers were using
government-stock rag

04:47.317 --> 04:49.752
complete with indicator fibres.
There's no way

04:49.820 --> 04:52.822
to get your hands on that stuff.
And then it hit me. It's real.

04:52.890 --> 04:55.124
- They're printing real money?
- They're using real bills.

04:55.191 --> 04:56.992
Bleaching out the ink
from fives, reprinting them

04:57.059 --> 04:58.994
- as twenties and hundreds.
- I'm impressed.

04:59.061 --> 05:00.862
- Thank you.
- With them.

05:00.930 --> 05:03.064
- That's just very clever.
- Well, not so clever.

05:03.132 --> 05:05.066
I've got facial recognition on
two of the guys who were passing

05:05.134 --> 05:07.068
the bills. Warrants are out.
(A phone rings.)

05:07.136 --> 05:09.905
- McCluskey.
- McCluskey, it's Oz.

05:09.972 --> 05:12.340
- Oz, what's going on?
- Toby went into a bank to get some money

05:12.408 --> 05:15.009
and now, it's being robbed. He left his mic on.
I heard them threatening hostages.

05:15.076 --> 05:16.944
- Where are you?
- First Toronto Bank

05:17.012 --> 05:18.812
- at the corner of Carling and Spadina.
- OK, we're on our way.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.749
There's a hold-up downtown.
Toby's a hostage.

05:21.816 --> 05:23.751
As in Toby, your face-reader?

05:23.818 --> 05:25.753
I thought he gave up
his interest in freelance policing.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.755
Well, I don't think
this was his idea.

05:27.822 --> 05:29.789
Where are you going?
ETF will have this covered.

05:29.857 --> 05:31.858
Toby's an asset.
They don't know what we know.

05:31.926 --> 05:34.193
And what exactly
do we know?

05:41.435 --> 05:44.403
Hands over your head! Come on,
hands together! Hands together!

05:44.471 --> 05:46.405
(deep breath)
Take your time, calm down.

05:46.473 --> 05:48.574
Do it right the first time.

05:48.641 --> 05:52.411
Everybody
just be patient and quiet!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.279
Hands over your head!

05:56.846 --> 05:59.084
This won't take long.
(The door beeps.)

06:02.555 --> 06:05.756
The key, good, good.
We're in, buddy.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.093
- Take her back to the others.
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Come on. move!

06:10.160 --> 06:12.729
Tie her up!
You like being tied up,

06:12.797 --> 06:15.199
- don't you, sweetheart?
[Bank manager]: Please, no.

06:15.266 --> 06:17.534
Ha! Ha! Ha!

06:18.602 --> 06:19.536
Give me the bag.

06:19.604 --> 06:22.772
I just handed them five million
dollars we were transferring.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.576
You did what you had to do.

06:26.644 --> 06:29.278
OK, well are there any cameras
inside the bank?

06:29.846 --> 06:31.948
Have we tapped into them yet?

06:33.016 --> 06:34.450
Who's on the scene?

06:35.018 --> 06:36.753
Yeah, we're five minutes out.

06:36.821 --> 06:39.089
We'll check in with ETF
when we get there. OK.

06:39.156 --> 06:41.091
What's the story?

06:41.158 --> 06:43.092
Metro's arriving any minute.
ETF is right behind them.

06:43.159 --> 06:45.594
Do we have a visual
on the robbers?

06:45.662 --> 06:49.098
No, they killed the security cameras.
We're flying blind. We have no idea how many of them

06:49.165 --> 06:52.167
- there are or what kind of weaponry they're holding.
- If they took out the cameras,

06:52.235 --> 06:54.103
they know what they're doing.
They're probably pros.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.038
Well, that could work
to our advantage.

06:56.106 --> 06:57.972
They like to keep it clean,
no bloodshed.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.907
That's if ETF lets them
get in and out quickly.

06:59.975 --> 07:01.809
Otherwise, it could escalate.

07:01.877 --> 07:04.045
Let's not go there.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.781
Just think, maybe Klein was right.
Maybe our participation will complicate things.

07:06.849 --> 07:08.482
We're not just
abandoning Toby.

07:08.550 --> 07:12.754
I just hope he doesn't
try to be a hero.

07:12.821 --> 07:14.487
(siren)

07:16.524 --> 07:18.959
(beep! beep! beep!)

07:29.936 --> 07:32.437
(beep! beep! beep!)

07:37.443 --> 07:39.344
We're on the move, my man!

07:39.412 --> 07:42.715
On the move! Keep your heads
down. This'll be over soon.

07:42.783 --> 07:44.950
(sirens)

07:46.786 --> 07:48.920
- What?
- Son of a bitch!

07:49.988 --> 07:50.989
Over your head!

07:51.557 --> 07:54.025
Who tripped the alarm?

07:54.093 --> 07:56.728
Huh?

07:57.796 --> 07:58.529
Who tripped the alarm?

07:58.597 --> 08:01.066
(whimpers)

08:03.134 --> 08:06.136
Right here, right here.

08:06.971 --> 08:10.074
Oh, wow! Look at your big hero!

08:10.141 --> 08:12.609
Hey, pretty boy!
Look what I'm gonna do now!

08:12.677 --> 08:14.611
No, no, no.

08:14.679 --> 08:16.613
When we start sending
bodies out of here,

08:16.681 --> 08:19.716
guess who's going
to be the first, huh?

08:19.783 --> 08:22.251
Plan B, fellas.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.854
Limit your exposure
to the window.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.856
Sergeant Cray?
McCluskey and Clark.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.858
IIB. What's
ETF's status?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.860
This isn't a glory op.
What's your interest?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.761
- One of our people is in there.
- Which one?

08:32.830 --> 08:35.163
- He's a paramedic.
- Which is he? Medic or cop?

08:35.231 --> 08:37.164
That's kind of
complicated, actually.

08:37.232 --> 08:39.101
Well, hopefully he can help
to keep things cool in there.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.102
Otherwise, this is
our operation.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.138
No room
for outside agencies.

08:43.206 --> 08:45.340
- Excuse me.
- Um, OK, but if you...

08:45.407 --> 08:47.342
Don't you just love
interdepartmental cooperation?

08:47.409 --> 08:49.344
There's got to be something
you guys can do, right?

08:49.411 --> 08:52.113
It's the ETF's operation.
All we can do is see how it plays out.

08:52.180 --> 08:56.083
Maybe that's not all.
I know Toby said he'd stopped using his thing,

08:56.151 --> 08:58.786
- but apparently, he didn't.
- We can't exactly tell ETF that, right?

08:58.854 --> 09:00.855
No, but it might mean
we have a way to help after all.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.923
Let's get Klein down here.

09:05.826 --> 09:08.061
This is not good, man.
Not good!

09:08.129 --> 09:11.965
- Can you shut him up?
- Take it easy. We have hostages

09:12.032 --> 09:14.934
and we have a plan. You stay
cool, we get out of here clean.

09:24.510 --> 09:26.478
Back door, go!

09:26.545 --> 09:29.848
You, come on! What do you say
you and me go steady, huh?

09:29.916 --> 09:31.716
Let's go!
(She whimpers.)

09:36.321 --> 09:38.656
It's not lookin good, man!
(Her knife clicks open)

09:39.723 --> 09:42.127
Lots of people
out there!

09:44.195 --> 09:46.597
(He whimpers.)
OK. It's going to be OK.

09:46.665 --> 09:48.532
- We've got three cop cars.
- [Whispering]: Look at me.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.603
Look at me. It's going
to be all right, man.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.041
You got... You got what?
You've got a wife,

09:58.109 --> 10:00.043
you've got kids,
a graduation, maybe?

10:00.111 --> 10:02.112
You're going
to have all that, OK?

10:02.180 --> 10:05.782
Relax, breathe.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.651
What do we do now?

10:08.719 --> 10:11.720
You should stay down
on your knees!

10:13.890 --> 10:17.392
(hyperventilating)

10:22.032 --> 10:27.535
You know what's going to be good
after all this? A nice vacation.

10:27.602 --> 10:31.639
Sun, sand.

10:31.707 --> 10:35.243
Forget about all this.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.112
Are you a psychologist
or a paramedic?

10:38.180 --> 10:40.114
Something like that.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.015
Shut up.
(She whimpers.)

10:42.083 --> 10:45.185
Stop talking!

10:45.253 --> 10:48.222
(siren)

10:52.193 --> 10:54.794
ETF weren't crazy
about our participation,

10:54.863 --> 10:57.164
but I talked to the chief
about getting us special status.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.165
Thank you.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.400
Well, Logan's one
of ours, right?

11:01.468 --> 11:03.402
Is there any chance
you can get us a shot

11:03.470 --> 11:05.404
at communicating with him?
Look, he could help.

11:05.472 --> 11:07.706
How exactly? By reading
people's expressions?

11:07.774 --> 11:11.410
I can't explain right now.
You just have to trust me.

11:11.478 --> 11:13.545
I'll see what I can do.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.060
Why haven't they called yet,
huh? What are they doing?

11:29.128 --> 11:31.695
Take it easy. We wait.

11:31.763 --> 11:34.398
They make the first move.

11:36.334 --> 11:39.169
Drop your weapon, now!
Get down! Get down!

11:39.237 --> 11:42.572
Do it now. Drop it!
Drop it! It's OK.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.242
- Now.
- We're done, we're done.

11:46.310 --> 11:48.444
I'm going to slide
it over. OK?

11:48.812 --> 11:50.613
Don't shoot.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.915
(gunshot)
(She screams.)

11:51.982 --> 11:53.816
(Many people scream.)
Oh, no!

11:53.884 --> 11:55.751
(clamour)

11:55.819 --> 11:58.054
(The security guard moans.)

12:03.338 --> 12:06.473
Shots fired! Get me
a line into the bank. Now!

12:07.291 --> 12:10.558
- You could've killed me.
- You would've deserved it.

12:10.626 --> 12:13.228
Move.
(The security guard moans.)

12:13.296 --> 12:15.264
I can save her.
Let me help her, OK?

12:15.331 --> 12:17.266
- Shut up.
- No one's dead yet.

12:17.333 --> 12:21.536
If she dies, this is a different
story. You know that.

12:21.604 --> 12:25.172
- He's got a point.
- OK. Do it, cut him loose.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.542
First to go.

12:28.610 --> 12:31.078
(She screams.)

12:34.549 --> 12:38.019
Look at me. I'm going to take
care of you. What's your name?

12:38.086 --> 12:40.888
- Sandy.
- Sandy, that was a stupid thing to do.

12:40.956 --> 12:43.023
- Yeah, I know.
- My name's Toby. Help me out.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.893
(She moans.)

12:45.960 --> 12:48.662
All right, look at me. Look at
me. You got to breathe. Relax!

12:48.730 --> 12:50.931
- Is she going to be OK?
- OK, breathe, breathe.

12:50.998 --> 12:53.066
This is gonna hurt. You ready?

12:53.134 --> 12:56.904
- Yeah.
- OK, OK, breathe.

12:56.971 --> 13:00.172
Breathe. Good. That's good.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.375
Look, this is all I got, man.
Everything else

13:03.444 --> 13:06.446
- is back in my truck, this is it.
- Improvise, smart guy.

13:06.513 --> 13:10.483
Everybody, calm down. This
doesn't have to happen again.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.785
(A phone rings.)
Here we go. All right!

13:13.853 --> 13:16.721
- Hello.
- Do you have a name?

13:16.789 --> 13:19.591
- What can I call you?
- Oh, good.

13:19.659 --> 13:21.593
Establishing a rapport.
Playing this by the book, right?

13:21.661 --> 13:23.528
Is everybody OK in there?

13:23.596 --> 13:25.530
We heard a shot.

13:25.598 --> 13:27.933
The security guard
tried some heroics.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.367
She's still alive, but it'd
be better for everybody

13:30.435 --> 13:33.437
if we take care of this fast.
(The security guard moans.)

13:33.505 --> 13:35.439
Breathe. Good. OK.

13:36.507 --> 13:38.041
Are they going to kill us?

13:38.109 --> 13:41.879
They won't if you don't
give them a reason to, OK?

13:41.947 --> 13:45.015
I think I can get my hands
free. That'd be two of us.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.016
We could take a couple
of them out, get their guns.

13:47.084 --> 13:50.453
No! If you do anything, they'll
start killing other people.

13:50.521 --> 13:53.389
They're gonna do it anyways.
Sending our bodies out one by one

13:53.457 --> 13:55.692
- until they get what they want.
- Shut up, man.

13:55.759 --> 13:58.495
They're not going
to kill anybody, OK?

13:58.562 --> 14:01.764
They know the police
won't let them out if they do.

14:01.832 --> 14:04.266
Yeah? How do you know?

14:04.334 --> 14:07.769
- Look at my uniform, man. I know what they're thinking.
- Yeah, right.

14:07.837 --> 14:10.306
Guess they don't hire ambulance
drivers for their guts.

14:10.374 --> 14:14.310
Shut up!
(He whimpers.)

14:15.378 --> 14:17.913
Now, what's it gonna take
to let these people go?

14:17.981 --> 14:19.847
Simple demands.

14:19.915 --> 14:22.417
Safe passage out of here.
Nobody on our tail.

14:22.485 --> 14:26.521
- That's a big order, partner.
- Screw the prepared scripts, there, partner.

14:26.588 --> 14:29.491
I'm not afraid to start shooting
some of these hostages.

14:30.558 --> 14:33.461
You don't give me what I want,
you're as responsible as I am.

14:33.529 --> 14:35.496
- You don't want to go there.
- You talk to your people

14:35.563 --> 14:37.431
or the bodies
start piling up.

14:37.499 --> 14:40.000
Make it happen.

14:40.068 --> 14:43.037
Man, killing people was not
supposed to be part of this.

14:43.104 --> 14:46.140
- Neither was getting busted.
- You really think they're gonna let us go?

14:46.207 --> 14:49.143
All we need is a head start.

14:56.683 --> 15:00.119
(He hears jumbled thoughts.)

15:00.187 --> 15:03.489
- [Woman, thinking to herself]: <i>I don't want to die.
</i> <i>- I just want to go home.</i>

15:09.594 --> 15:10.962
- Oz!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.464
- You can't go through.
- Ah, officer, she's with me.

15:13.532 --> 15:14.966
It's fine.
Thank you.

15:14.967 --> 15:16.468
Thank you,
she's a doctor, sorry.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.470
- What's the situation?
- There's a security guard

15:18.538 --> 15:20.472
down in there, they're trying
to get her out.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.473
- Where... What about Toby?
- I think he's fine.

15:22.541 --> 15:24.475
How the hell did he get
himself in this situation?

15:24.543 --> 15:26.477
I don't know, OK?
Trouble finds him.

15:26.545 --> 15:28.479
He didn't do
anything wrong.

15:29.547 --> 15:31.549
[Toby]: You're going to be
fine, Sandy. You'll be fine.

15:31.616 --> 15:34.585
You're doing great.

15:34.652 --> 15:39.755
Keep breathing.
Hey... is she gonna die?

15:39.823 --> 15:41.958
She will if she doesn't
get more help.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.995
You don't want that,
do you?

15:46.063 --> 15:48.531
I gotta do what I gotta do.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.500
How did you get involved
with these guys?

15:51.568 --> 15:53.970
Just keep working on her.

15:55.638 --> 15:57.906
You Wallace?

15:57.974 --> 15:59.308
I'm Pinto. This is Hurd.

16:01.144 --> 16:03.178
I got a job for you.

16:04.246 --> 16:06.815
This is about more than cash
for you, isn't it?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.691
You see these guys, they're
not thinking straight, man.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.228
It's not going to work out
the way they think it is.

16:20.295 --> 16:22.963
It never does.

16:23.031 --> 16:26.667
You got people who care about
you. You gotta think about them.

16:26.735 --> 16:30.771
What do you think I'm doing?
It's not for me.

16:31.839 --> 16:33.373
OK.

16:33.941 --> 16:37.177
Stop it! Just keep her alive.

16:40.982 --> 16:42.682
(She moans.)

16:43.750 --> 16:44.951
<i>I told you.</i>

16:45.019 --> 16:47.987
We're working as hard as we can.
But I can't wave a magic wand.

16:48.055 --> 16:50.089
Well, security guard doesn't
have a lot of time for you

16:50.157 --> 16:52.091
to wait for other people
to make your decisions for you.

16:52.159 --> 16:54.426
She dies, it's on you.

16:54.494 --> 16:56.963
See if I can talk to
the paramedic. Tell him

16:57.031 --> 16:59.564
I'm a doctor. He works
with our team. He can help.

16:59.632 --> 17:01.800
I have a doctor here.

17:01.868 --> 17:05.137
- She wants to talk to the paramedic.
- No, no, no way.

17:05.204 --> 17:06.972
Nobody wants her to die.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.574
You, medic!

17:10.142 --> 17:12.076
Get over here. They want
to talk to you. Let's go.

17:12.144 --> 17:13.578
I got to keep pressure
on her. Can someone else

17:13.646 --> 17:15.579
keep pressure on her?
Can I help?

17:15.646 --> 17:17.181
Do it. Do it. Watch her.

17:17.248 --> 17:20.050
Come here.
Pressure her in here.

17:20.117 --> 17:22.752
- Let's go! Come on!
- OK.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.622
- The clock's ticking.
- Yeah, I got it. - Watch what you say.

17:25.691 --> 17:28.826
That's right. OK. Hey, Logan.

17:28.894 --> 17:31.728
Logan, this is Dr. McCluskey.

17:31.796 --> 17:34.397
Hey, long time, doc.

17:34.464 --> 17:36.666
- How is she doing?
- She's lost a lot of blood.

17:36.734 --> 17:38.668
Bullet's through and through.
Pulse negligible.

17:38.736 --> 17:40.503
Is there anything else
you can tell me?

17:40.571 --> 17:42.438
If I can get her to you, you
can do the necessary extraction.

17:42.506 --> 17:44.307
- That's it, enough talking.
- That's it.

17:44.374 --> 17:47.242
We have to get
her out of there.

17:47.310 --> 17:50.713
- You listening to me?
- You want something,

17:50.780 --> 17:52.715
you got to give something.

17:52.782 --> 17:54.683
We need to get the guard out
and get her some help.

17:54.751 --> 17:56.885
Call it a sign of good faith.

17:56.953 --> 17:59.888
She's dying. You ever seen
someone die before?

17:59.956 --> 18:02.524
[The thief, thinking to himself]: <i>Try
two tours</i> <i>in Afghanistan, pal.</i>

18:02.592 --> 18:05.059
Two minutes. You get a stretcher
and a paramedic at the door.

18:05.127 --> 18:09.230
No extra equipment. No tricks.

18:09.297 --> 18:13.234
Sit down! Ah! What?
Somebody have a boo-boo?

18:13.301 --> 18:16.503
Hey! Hey! It's gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.

18:16.571 --> 18:18.706
All right? I'm going
to take care of you.

18:18.773 --> 18:22.375
You got to talk to Sergeant McCluskey, all right?
You're going to tell her--

18:22.443 --> 18:25.045
This is crazy, man!
Giving up our advantage!

18:25.113 --> 18:28.715
We got 15 hostages left. We got lots of moves to play.
All right, here they are.

18:28.783 --> 18:31.818
(Toby is whispering to the guard)
Get the door!

18:31.886 --> 18:36.021
- Get the door! - Open it.
- All right, now anybody

18:36.089 --> 18:38.323
tries anything crazy, you're
gonna go out in a body bag,

18:38.391 --> 18:40.860
- not a stretcher. Got it?
- Stop!

18:40.927 --> 18:42.795
Put your hands on your head.
Hands on your head.

18:46.565 --> 18:47.933
What are you looking at?

18:48.001 --> 18:49.735
- Eyes down.
- We're good.

18:49.803 --> 18:52.203
OK, go.

18:52.271 --> 18:55.039
- OK.
- Let's not talk, OK?

18:55.107 --> 18:57.742
OK.

18:57.810 --> 18:59.744
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
(The security guards moans.)

18:59.812 --> 19:02.346
- All right.
- You OK?

19:02.414 --> 19:04.515
And you thought this day
couldn't get any worse, right?

19:04.583 --> 19:06.550
There are a lot of people counting
on you to stay in one piece.

19:06.618 --> 19:09.286
- Yeah. I'm one of them.
- OK, great. 1, 2, 3.

19:09.353 --> 19:11.354
(The guard moans.)

19:16.661 --> 19:18.495
Just a little quiet time,
boys and girls.

19:19.562 --> 19:21.731
- Remember naptime?
- You got it?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.133
I got it.

19:41.717 --> 19:43.151
Watch out, excuse me.

19:43.219 --> 19:45.620
- Can... Can I speak with her?
- That's not a good idea.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.355
- McCluskey?
- Yeah.

19:47.423 --> 19:49.257
He said their names
are Pinto, Hurd and Wallace.

19:49.325 --> 19:52.593
And Pinto is the boss.
He said he's ex-military.

19:52.661 --> 19:54.595
OK. Is there
anything else?

19:54.663 --> 19:56.730
Yeah. They want
to get to a factory.

19:56.798 --> 19:58.732
There's a lot
of machinery

19:58.800 --> 20:01.635
and metal lathes
and high-speed drills.

20:01.703 --> 20:04.771
- OK.
- They got to go through a manhole.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.841
OK. Is there anything else?
Anything at all?

20:06.908 --> 20:08.508
We've got to get
her in, I'm sorry.

20:08.576 --> 20:10.977
- Here we go.
- Check out the names

20:11.045 --> 20:13.646
and start cross-referencing the factories
in the area with the city service tunnels.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.082
OK.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.718
What the hell was that all about?
How could Logan tell her all of that?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.087
Toby's good at getting people
to trust him. You know that.

20:21.155 --> 20:24.090
What, I'm supposed to believe they told him their names?
Their plans? Nobody's that good.

20:24.158 --> 20:27.092
We don't have time for this.
We have to try to figure out where they were heading.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.095
I have to intercede with ETF, but
you're not telling me the truth.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.097
I'm telling you
what I can right now.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.666
- OK? What you will believe.
- Michelle! Nothing proceeds

20:34.734 --> 20:36.534
until I have something more
substantial to offer them.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.837
There are 15 peoples' lives
at stake in there right now.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.672
Just tell me
how he knows!

20:41.740 --> 20:43.341
OK.

20:44.408 --> 20:45.476
He's a mind reader.

20:45.543 --> 20:49.546
Don't play games.

20:49.614 --> 20:51.615
Oh my God, you mean it.

20:52.183 --> 20:53.751
You think the ETF
is gonna believe you

20:53.818 --> 20:55.987
any more than you
believe me right now?

21:04.817 --> 21:06.552
Michelle, hold up a second.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.737
Say what you're telling me
is true. What's he doing

21:08.804 --> 21:10.739
working as a paramedic?
That's what he does.

21:10.806 --> 21:13.642
- He could be making a fortune.
- Have you met Toby?

21:13.709 --> 21:15.977
He could be
clearing more cases.

21:16.045 --> 21:18.013
That's not how it works.
Look, it doesn't work perfectly

21:18.080 --> 21:21.016
and it doesn't work all the time.
But he's certainly helped us in the past.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.683
Hey! So I checked out
the names the guard gave us.

21:22.751 --> 21:24.352
Wallace didn't show up,
but Hurd and Pinto did.

21:24.419 --> 21:26.720
Trey Hurd's got a record
stretching back to juvie.

21:26.788 --> 21:28.722
- What about Pinto?
- Just like Toby said.

21:28.790 --> 21:31.159
He's ex-military,
made colonel in Afghanistan.

21:31.226 --> 21:33.561
He's a specialist in strategy
and incursion techniques

21:33.629 --> 21:35.563
Since the military,

21:35.631 --> 21:37.565
he's been a suspect
in a string of robberies.

21:37.633 --> 21:40.500
There have been shootings
at three of the incidents.

21:40.568 --> 21:43.503
Is there any way you can get the ETF to hold
off for half an hour before making their call?

21:43.571 --> 21:45.772
I'm still not sure
I believe any of this...

21:45.839 --> 21:47.674
but I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.776
I'll get you your half hour,
because clearly,

21:49.843 --> 21:52.045
Sergeant Cray and I
are forming a love connection.

21:52.112 --> 21:54.246
Let's move.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.615
Look, you got to make
those guys listen.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.983
You've got a family.
You must love them.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.553
- Shut up.
- Hey. All right, look.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.555
We all get in
over our heads sometimes,

22:02.622 --> 22:05.057
OK? We do something stupid.
But this thing goes wrong,

22:05.124 --> 22:07.059
you're gonna be paying for it
for the rest of your life.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.127
You think you know.
You don't know anything.

22:09.196 --> 22:11.696
I know you, man.
It's all over your face.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.399
I don't have a way out.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.000
You do. You help me
keep these people safe

22:16.068 --> 22:19.504
and I'll make sure the police
take that into account.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.608
You're not even operating
this, are you?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.577
Whoever is is still out there.

22:32.817 --> 22:35.485
I can't.

22:35.553 --> 22:38.154
OK. We can help each other.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.290
You think about that.

22:46.129 --> 22:48.063
- I've identified 20 factories
within a 6-mile radius.

22:48.131 --> 22:50.266
Twelve of them
have machining equipment.

22:50.334 --> 22:54.036
Now, if I overlay
the city's utilities systems...

22:54.104 --> 22:55.771
Four of them are situated
on top of the grid

22:55.839 --> 22:57.540
- for city utilities.
- Can you see which ones

22:57.608 --> 23:00.208
- have outlets in the factories?
- Officially? None.

23:00.276 --> 23:02.210
But that doesn't mean someone
didn't make their own access.

23:02.278 --> 23:04.379
OK, well we don't have much
time. Let's see what we can do.

23:14.356 --> 23:16.357
How you doing?

23:17.924 --> 23:19.293
[Whispering]:
What is happening?

23:20.361 --> 23:21.962
Why won't they let them go?

23:22.029 --> 23:23.964
The police
are taking care of it.

23:25.031 --> 23:26.533
Everything's
gonna be okay.

23:26.601 --> 23:30.637
Just stay calm,
breathe. Cool.

23:30.704 --> 23:36.342
That's what the manual says.
It says, "follow protocol".

23:36.410 --> 23:38.344
But I didn't imagine
it would be like this.

23:38.412 --> 23:39.779
You're doing great.

23:43.049 --> 23:45.585
Hey, this looks good. I think
there's a new box in the back,

23:45.653 --> 23:47.919
if you can just grab that.
Hey!

23:47.987 --> 23:51.323
Come on, hey! Get some eyes
on. Get some eyes on with that.

23:51.391 --> 23:53.191
Hey! Excuse me!

23:53.259 --> 23:55.160
Come on, guys! Seriously! Step
this up. We got to deliver Titan

23:55.227 --> 23:58.297
by six. Hey.
What can I do for you?

23:58.364 --> 24:01.466
We need to know if you have any
access to the city utility tunnels.

24:01.534 --> 24:03.835
Since when are cops interested
in building codes?

24:03.903 --> 24:06.704
There's been a gas leak in the area.
We want to make sure nobody's at risk.

24:06.772 --> 24:10.341
Well, nobody's smelt any gas.
My guys have been here all day.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.710
Are there any inputs
to the sewer system?

24:12.778 --> 24:15.413
Yeah, yeah. We got 6-inch
drains every 30 feet.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.916
Guys, look, reload
that skid! Get it back!

24:18.983 --> 24:20.550
You mind if we take
a look around?

24:20.618 --> 24:22.519
I'm sorry, the owner's
not here.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.988
Nobody searches nothing
without him okaying it, so...

24:25.056 --> 24:26.990
(crash)

24:27.058 --> 24:28.992
I'm sorry, I gotta
get back to this.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.094
Thank you.

24:31.162 --> 24:33.496
- So that's it?
- It was the last one

24:33.564 --> 24:35.397
on the list. Nobody says they
have any access to the tunnels.

24:35.465 --> 24:38.167
OK, well. Either somebody's
lying or Toby's read is off.

24:43.807 --> 24:46.675
That's right. I want all four
factories under surveillance

24:46.743 --> 24:48.878
until after this situation
is resolved.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.746
Yeah. I got it. I got it!

24:51.814 --> 24:53.748
Just call me
if there's any movement.

24:53.816 --> 24:56.918
So we have
their escape route covered?

24:56.986 --> 24:59.754
Yeah. I'll start the process for search
warrants, but it's going to take some time.

24:59.822 --> 25:02.257
Especially if all we have to go
on is one of Toby's reads.

25:02.325 --> 25:05.426
We only have 20 minutes before the ETF
makes their call. Then it could get messy.

25:05.494 --> 25:07.862
And we're back to Toby
being our only channel.

25:10.131 --> 25:12.132
He's going to be OK.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.268
Yeah, I know.

25:14.336 --> 25:16.270
I just wish he wouldn't have
gotten himself involved in this.

25:16.338 --> 25:18.239
He saw people in trouble,
then he went to help.

25:18.306 --> 25:20.341
It's what he does.

25:22.244 --> 25:24.310
We're gonna
get him out of there.

25:29.183 --> 25:31.050
Everything's going great.

25:31.118 --> 25:32.952
I'm looking forward
to seeing you out here.

25:33.020 --> 25:36.155
You just about
ready to come out?

25:36.223 --> 25:39.158
Mister, either you are not listening
to me or I am not making myself clear.

25:39.226 --> 25:41.794
You need an example?

25:44.063 --> 25:46.064
Get up. Come on!

25:49.035 --> 25:51.470
Let's go.

25:54.674 --> 25:56.808
I'm going to blow this man
away while you're watching.

25:56.876 --> 26:01.078
And then we're gonna talk about how
I get a safe passage out of here.

26:04.550 --> 26:06.785
You really gonna shoot
someone? Come on, man.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.622
You gonna shoot me too?
You know, fine!

26:10.689 --> 26:12.589
'Cause once you start
killing people,

26:12.657 --> 26:16.059
we're as good
as dead anyway!

26:16.127 --> 26:18.796
(chuckles)

26:18.863 --> 26:22.800
You got 30 seconds
to give me an answer.

26:22.867 --> 26:26.002
My best bet is getting them
outside and dropping them.

26:26.070 --> 26:28.404
We know who the robbers are.
We think they're going to use

26:28.472 --> 26:30.205
the city service tunnels to
get back to their headquarters.

26:30.273 --> 26:32.508
- And how did you find that out?
- Confidential source.

26:32.576 --> 26:35.177
We've narrowed down their
destination to four locations.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.480
If we let them run, we can stage
a pre-emptive strike.

26:37.548 --> 26:39.782
- She's right.
- Anyone listening?

26:39.850 --> 26:41.818
Ten seconds left.

26:41.885 --> 26:44.253
Open air. We get them outside

26:44.321 --> 26:46.388
and take the shot.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.525
OK, you win.

26:50.593 --> 26:52.394
Give us a couple minutes
to move our people back.

26:52.462 --> 26:54.529
(The hostage groans.)

26:58.267 --> 27:00.234
Take this.

27:00.302 --> 27:02.503
OK, ready to move?
Ready to move?

27:02.571 --> 27:05.806
- You're coming with me, sir. Let's go.
- Hey! Leave him alone, leave him alone.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.209
-  Take me. Take me. Yeah.
- (Whispering): No!

27:08.277 --> 27:12.347
Don't worry, buttercup.
I'm not leaving you behind.

27:20.803 --> 27:22.903
Baker, you have
the windbreaker and cap.

27:22.971 --> 27:24.238
Bennett, blondie.

27:24.306 --> 27:26.207
Gary, you have porkpie hat.

27:26.275 --> 27:28.376
Acquire targets and check in
when you have a shot.

27:28.443 --> 27:32.046
We go on my word. Ground units,
clear to 20 metres.

27:32.113 --> 27:34.048
We are letting them walk out.

27:34.115 --> 27:37.985
If they get to their vehicle,
aerial will engage in pursuit.

27:43.924 --> 27:46.660
Anybody outside tries to make
any funny moves, taking us out,

27:46.727 --> 27:50.197
it's a little twitch to the trigger finger.
One of you goes with us. Understand?

27:50.264 --> 27:53.200
- We understand all right.
- The rest of you, face down on the floor.

27:53.267 --> 27:55.568
You make a move before
we're out of here safely,

27:55.635 --> 27:57.736
make no mistake. You will die.

27:57.804 --> 28:01.407
All right, everyone, it's
gonna be okay. Just stay calm.

28:01.474 --> 28:04.276
[In thought]: <i>Show up</i>
<i>for my family... my family...</i>

28:04.344 --> 28:06.011
<i>my baby girl.</i> <i>[In
thought]:</i> <i>I don't like this.</i>

28:06.079 --> 28:08.914
[In thought]: <i>Bastard!</i> <i>(Toby
hears more</i> <i>jumbled thoughts)</i>

28:08.981 --> 28:12.417
(explosion)

28:12.484 --> 28:15.620
- [In thought]: <i>Please!</i> <i>-</i> [In
thought]: <i>Oh God! Help us please!</i>

28:15.688 --> 28:18.789
OK, let's go! Move over here,
make a circle around us.

28:18.857 --> 28:21.726
Let's go, boys and girls!
Let's go. On your feet!

28:21.793 --> 28:23.928
You sure this is
the best idea, man?

28:23.995 --> 28:25.796
Everybody, come on! Move!

28:28.066 --> 28:30.167
Move!
Let's go! In a circle,

28:30.235 --> 28:33.170
- let's go. - Right around behind me.
- Good. - Hands together.

28:33.238 --> 28:36.406
Listen guys, there's gonna be
snipers on the roof. Stay low.

28:36.474 --> 28:39.744
Keep a piece of meat between you and
the shooters at all times. Good to go?

28:39.811 --> 28:41.879
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

29:02.698 --> 29:06.135
Move! Move! Move!
Catch up! Catch up!

29:06.202 --> 29:08.436
(The hostages whimper.)

29:12.708 --> 29:14.476
Come on, guys! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

29:14.543 --> 29:16.443
Go! Go!

29:18.313 --> 29:20.114
Whoa.

29:20.182 --> 29:23.217
This is your van?
Go! Go! Go!

29:23.285 --> 29:25.419
No! No! No! That's not right.
Something's not right here.

29:25.487 --> 29:28.722
- Get in the van!
- No! I'm not getting in that van! That van is gonna explode!

29:28.791 --> 29:31.691
Wallace, listen to me, man!
Wallace, listen to me. Don't get in that van!

29:31.759 --> 29:34.227
- Move!
- No! That van is gonna explode!

29:34.295 --> 29:37.297
- Get him in there! - Let's go!
- Don't get in the van!

29:37.364 --> 29:39.199
- Move!
- No! It's going to explode!

29:43.037 --> 29:44.871
- I have the solution.
- Take the shot.

29:44.939 --> 29:46.406
(gunshot)

29:46.473 --> 29:48.507
(screaming)
(quick intake of breath)

29:48.574 --> 29:51.277
Get back!

29:51.344 --> 29:54.680
(He groans.)

29:54.747 --> 29:57.817
(explosion)

30:14.566 --> 30:17.035
- Hey! You with us?
- Yeah.

30:17.102 --> 30:18.969
- All right?
- How's your head?

30:19.037 --> 30:20.871
It's all right.
Go take care of those people.

30:20.939 --> 30:22.806
- Yeah, come on.
- I'm good.

30:27.645 --> 30:30.580
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm going to use an ATM next time.

30:30.648 --> 30:32.282
- That wasn't us. It was a bomb.
- I saw it.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.517
I knew it was going to happen.
Are you seeing the future

30:34.585 --> 30:36.319
- now too?
- I don't know.

30:36.386 --> 30:39.255
Maybe it was
one of them.

30:39.323 --> 30:42.325
Well, we have surveillance on four of the
factories still. Did you see anything else?

30:42.392 --> 30:44.426
I want to talk to him.

30:45.494 --> 30:46.462
I'll take it off.

30:46.529 --> 30:48.464
Yeah, if you're
feeling up for it.

30:48.531 --> 30:50.866
Oh, yeah. I think there's
someone else involved in this

30:50.933 --> 30:52.934
and I want
to find out who it is.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.738
How did you know
about the van?

30:56.805 --> 30:58.773
Hey, who set this up?

30:58.841 --> 31:00.575
This wasn't my operation.

31:00.642 --> 31:03.011
Really? So you tried
to blow yourself up?

31:03.079 --> 31:05.113
You know, if I were you
I'd be talking a blue streak

31:05.181 --> 31:07.514
about who just tried
to kill me.

31:07.582 --> 31:10.784
[Thinking to himself]: <i>Won't</i> <i>rat him out,
but Newman's</i> <i>a dead man when I get out.</i>

31:10.852 --> 31:14.955
We know that Newman
set this up.

31:17.158 --> 31:20.560
- We got to go.
- Right, get in there. Check out the other patients.

31:25.499 --> 31:28.734
<i>I know you saved my life,</i>
<i>but I... I can't..</i>

31:28.802 --> 31:32.505
<i>I'm not ratting anybody out.</i>
<i>I know you helped me in there.</i>

31:32.572 --> 31:35.909
And you tried to stop Pinto
from killing people. I saw that.

31:35.976 --> 31:37.911
I'm going to tell
them that.

31:37.978 --> 31:39.912
You're going to see
your daughter again.

31:39.979 --> 31:41.846
He knows where I live, man.

31:41.915 --> 31:43.748
He knows where my kid is.
I can't talk.

31:43.816 --> 31:46.785
Exactly. You think he's gonna
leave your family alone?

31:46.852 --> 31:50.455
He's gonna think that you told
them something. Do you get that?

31:52.023 --> 31:55.026
Pinto's already talked.

31:55.093 --> 31:57.395
Yes, he told us
it was Newman.

31:57.462 --> 31:59.797
He passed out before
he could tell us the rest.

31:59.864 --> 32:03.334
Do you want him to get
the credit for cooperating?

32:03.402 --> 32:05.636
You really want to take
the whole weight for this?

32:07.605 --> 32:10.908
All we need to know
is where he is, that's it.

32:13.610 --> 32:16.112
It'll help you out.

32:16.680 --> 32:19.416
He owns a machine shop.

32:21.352 --> 32:24.687
It's called
Milgrade Machining.

32:24.755 --> 32:28.458
So you guys do your part
and I'll do mine.

32:33.129 --> 32:35.865
All right.
I'm going to do what I can.

32:37.933 --> 32:39.301
Promise you that.

32:45.574 --> 32:47.408
Well?

32:47.477 --> 32:49.410
So the guy they were dealing
with at Milgrade,

32:49.479 --> 32:53.014
he's mid-thirties,
dirty blond hair. Scruffy.

32:53.082 --> 32:56.017
- That's the guy we talked to.
- OK... I'll have the uniforms

32:56.085 --> 32:58.019
that are watching his building
bring him in.

32:59.087 --> 33:00.187
Great.

33:02.556 --> 33:04.391
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.494
You're making
a big mistake here.

33:06.561 --> 33:08.729
You're the one
who's making the mistake.

33:08.797 --> 33:12.733
You forgot to mention that you opened up
a connection to the city service tunnels

33:12.801 --> 33:14.735
right in the middle
of your shop floor.

33:14.803 --> 33:17.069
I don't have time
to give tours of my place.

33:17.137 --> 33:20.974
I had a shipment to get out,
so that proves nothing.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.376
And neither does the stash of
automatic weapons in your car?

33:23.443 --> 33:25.444
Guy's got
to protect himself.

33:25.513 --> 33:28.548
Sure, no one else is protecting you.
Pinto and Hurd have already talked.

33:28.616 --> 33:31.283
[Thinking to himself]:
<i>Bluffing. They'd never talk.</i>

33:31.351 --> 33:33.418
The big question is why all
of this preparation for a job

33:33.486 --> 33:36.922
that only netted a quarter
of a million in cash?

33:36.990 --> 33:38.957
[Thinking to himself]:
<i>Try five million.</i>

33:39.025 --> 33:41.660
<i>Already safe and sound.</i>

33:44.463 --> 33:46.732
(In a low voice):
It's five million.

33:46.799 --> 33:49.500
And he's already got it.
No, they cleared out

33:49.568 --> 33:51.502
the vault. All they had
on them was 250K.

33:51.570 --> 33:53.704
I know what I heard.
The bank manager,

33:53.772 --> 33:55.706
Anna, said
the same thing.

33:55.774 --> 33:59.410
The money was supposed
to be there in transit.

33:59.477 --> 34:02.112
Supposed to be... Maybe
the money was already gone

34:02.180 --> 34:05.849
before the robbers got there.
And Pinto and the others

34:05.917 --> 34:08.885
and the 250K were supposed
to explode in the truck

34:08.953 --> 34:11.087
to hide the real theft.

34:11.155 --> 34:14.757
OK, look. If you guys
don't have anything else,

34:14.824 --> 34:16.893
I have a job I have to do.

34:18.795 --> 34:22.264
OK. So if the five million dollars
disappeared within the six hours

34:22.331 --> 34:24.632
between when it was delivered
to the bank and the robbery,

34:24.701 --> 34:27.369
then we know that someone had to physically take
it out of there. It's got to be here somewhere.

34:27.437 --> 34:30.304
I just got to find it.

34:30.373 --> 34:32.739
So, is it true,

34:32.808 --> 34:34.609
what they tell me
about you?

34:34.677 --> 34:36.610
What did they tell you?

34:36.679 --> 34:38.413
Wait... Wait,
you told him?

34:38.481 --> 34:40.815
I had to, I had to get
in touch with you.

34:40.882 --> 34:42.815
Michelle... Come on.

34:42.884 --> 34:45.219
You'll excuse me if I still
find it hard to believe.

34:45.286 --> 34:47.487
No, that's fine. I mean,
it's a common reaction.

34:47.556 --> 34:51.492
You wouldn't happen to know what
I'm thinking right now, would you?

34:51.560 --> 34:54.261
You're thinking about
a girl named Carrie who works

34:54.329 --> 34:56.663
in a coffee shop. And you
should be ashamed of yourself.

34:57.731 --> 35:00.800
All right,
it was just a test...

35:00.867 --> 35:03.836
Guys, look at this.

35:04.904 --> 35:06.506
[Michelle]: Looks like Newman.

35:06.574 --> 35:09.041
And that's two hours
before the robbery.

35:09.110 --> 35:11.111
How does a guy
who owns a machining factory

35:11.178 --> 35:13.012
waltz into
the secure area of a bank?

35:13.080 --> 35:14.913
Well, that's where I start
to think this is an inside job.

35:14.981 --> 35:16.815
Now, we just have
to find out who helped him.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.651
Wait, there. Can you pause
and zoom in on his arm there?

35:25.024 --> 35:27.292
Could I borrow someone's phone?

35:27.360 --> 35:30.294
(A phone rings.)
Give me just one second, OK?

35:30.962 --> 35:32.296
Hey, Toby! What's up?

35:32.364 --> 35:34.031
Is the bank manager still
there? Is she around?

35:34.099 --> 35:35.833
Pretty blond, Anna.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.835
Just a second.

35:37.902 --> 35:40.271
Hey, Liv, do you know if
that bank manager is still here?

35:40.339 --> 35:42.773
I was looking after her
and turned around for a second.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.975
- Then she was gone.
- OK. Yeah, she took off.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.477
All right. Thanks, man.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.379
It's the bank manager.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.814
She's on the run.

35:53.031 --> 35:55.166
(sirens)

35:56.969 --> 35:58.003
You OK?

35:58.071 --> 36:00.371
I thought she was helping me.

36:00.438 --> 36:02.874
For a guy who spends so much time in other
people's heads, nothing should surprise you.

36:02.941 --> 36:05.142
You'd think, right?

36:05.210 --> 36:08.379
(sirens)

36:08.446 --> 36:10.581
(traffic sounds)

36:10.648 --> 36:13.784
Jeremy, I need a minute.

36:13.852 --> 36:17.387
Alvin, I've got a meeting with
the Deputy Minister in an hour.

36:17.454 --> 36:20.190
Yeah... I have
a proposal for you.

36:20.258 --> 36:22.325
Why does you saying that
always fill me with dread?

36:22.393 --> 36:25.996
This'll pay off
for you more than me.

36:27.965 --> 36:30.033
(deep breath)
All right. Talk.

36:32.635 --> 36:34.569
(siren)

36:39.509 --> 36:41.443
What's going on?

36:41.511 --> 36:43.512
You're under arrest
for homicide and robbery.

36:43.579 --> 36:46.581
- No. You don't understand.
- We picked up Jack Newman.

36:46.649 --> 36:48.249
He told us everything. You knew
the money was transferring

36:48.317 --> 36:50.118
through the bank.
You helped him steal that money

36:50.185 --> 36:52.120
- and plant the explosion.
- That's crazy.

36:52.187 --> 36:55.023
No, don't! You can't do that!
Don't open that!

36:58.493 --> 37:01.529
Were you willing to kill
Pinto and the others for that?

37:02.596 --> 37:04.697
They were murderers.
No one would have missed them.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.499
Yeah, and what about me
and the other hostages,

37:06.567 --> 37:08.568
what were we?

37:17.043 --> 37:18.045
You did good.

37:18.112 --> 37:20.746
- Thanks.
- I missed this.

37:20.814 --> 37:22.881
The brain freak
closing your cases?

37:22.950 --> 37:26.252
No, no. See, I can close
my own cases just fine.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.922
But I missed
working with you.

37:38.730 --> 37:43.001
Hey, excuse me. No cell
phones! What? Outside, please.

37:43.069 --> 37:45.437
Outside with
your cell phone! Hey!

37:45.504 --> 37:47.439
- Hey!
- Hey,

37:47.506 --> 37:49.441
No one's tried to kill you
for three or four months, man!

37:50.508 --> 37:52.242
Yeah, I kind of forgot
what it was like.

37:52.510 --> 37:54.144
So, do we still have time
for that game?

37:54.212 --> 37:57.448
- Yeah, you still want to play?
- Tommy's holding our seats. I could use a game now!

37:57.515 --> 37:59.850
I need to borrow
some money, though.

37:59.917 --> 38:01.852
Toby! Why didn't you tell me?

38:03.919 --> 38:05.956
- You told her.
- I didn't... Did I?

38:06.024 --> 38:09.125
I assumed you were using your gift in there.
But you've been using it all along?

38:09.193 --> 38:11.760
'Liv, I'm all good, all right?
Everything is different now.

38:11.828 --> 38:14.364
Let me be the judge
of that. Come on! Let's go!

38:15.431 --> 38:18.368
Yeah, I didn't... She could
have found out from anywhere!

38:19.435 --> 38:20.370
Hey.

38:20.437 --> 38:23.938
CAT scan and ECG
are perfectly fine.

38:24.007 --> 38:27.509
- Well that is a relief.
All your vitals are normal. - Yeah.

38:27.576 --> 38:29.577
You see, I told you.

38:29.645 --> 38:32.347
The problem was I was fighting
it, but I'm better now.

38:32.915 --> 38:35.450
You're better for now,
but we have no idea

38:35.518 --> 38:37.619
when this could flare up,
if it'll flare up again.

38:37.686 --> 38:40.388
All right, 'Liv. I'm not going to
pretend like it doesn't exist,

38:40.455 --> 38:42.823
but I'm not going
to live my life in fear.

38:43.591 --> 38:45.026
So you're going
back into this?

38:45.093 --> 38:47.428
Helping people? I don't know.
I mean, I was avoiding this

38:47.496 --> 38:48.896
and it came to me.
What does that mean?

38:48.963 --> 38:51.032
Is that a sign? I don't know.

38:51.099 --> 38:54.402
I just... Just because
you seem better won't stop me

38:54.469 --> 38:57.303
- from worrying about you.
- All right.

38:57.371 --> 38:59.039
Well, I enjoy
proving you wrong.

39:00.306 --> 39:01.274
Come here.

39:01.275 --> 39:04.710
Give me a hug. Thank you.

39:05.778 --> 39:08.048
Toby, at any sign

39:08.115 --> 39:11.217
- of a headache...
- You'll be the first to know.

39:12.685 --> 39:13.485
Promise.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.730
Thank God you're done.

39:24.798 --> 39:27.399
Last October's <i>Fashion Trends</i>
has lost its lustre.

39:27.467 --> 39:29.400
What are you doing here?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.703
Waiting for you.

39:31.771 --> 39:34.072
Huh. OK... why?

39:34.139 --> 39:36.107
You tell me.

39:36.175 --> 39:38.543
It's a lot easier
if you tell me.

39:38.611 --> 39:41.145
Over the months
that you were working for IIB,

39:41.213 --> 39:43.147
I've seen what
you can do...

39:43.215 --> 39:46.216
even if I didn't know
what I was seeing.

39:46.284 --> 39:50.320
I want to offer you
a chance to do it better.

39:52.791 --> 39:56.393
I have approval from upstairs
to form a new special ops unit.

39:56.461 --> 39:58.462
Assignments are purely
at the team's discretion.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.463
The most puzzling of crimes,

40:00.530 --> 40:03.132
cases that are impenetrable
to standard agencies.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.234
The team will have enhanced
security clearances

40:05.302 --> 40:07.704
and arrest powers... as well
as departmental promotion

40:07.771 --> 40:09.706
and pay increase.

40:09.773 --> 40:12.575
And who are
the lucky members of this team?

40:12.643 --> 40:14.376
You see? Incisive
interrogation techniques:

40:14.444 --> 40:16.878
That's why you're on.
You had me at pay increase.

40:16.946 --> 40:19.681
And I suppose you expect me to be a
part of this team as well, right?

40:19.749 --> 40:21.483
Brilliant deduction:
That's why you're on too.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.652
You see, I don't think
I'm cut out to be a cop.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.721
- Special consultant.
- I already have another job.

40:25.788 --> 40:28.090
I've already cleared it
with EMS.

40:28.157 --> 40:30.792
You'll be able to pick up shifts whenever you're
free, but the rest of the time, you're mine.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.293
- You mean ours?
- Didn't I say that? - No.

40:33.361 --> 40:36.664
- So does that mean I get a gun?
- [Michelle and Dev]: No.

40:36.732 --> 40:39.266
- But welcome aboard, partner.
- OK!

40:39.334 --> 40:42.569
- Le t's seal this with a drink.
- Yeah, about that.

40:42.637 --> 40:44.538
My wallet's in evidence. Do you
guys mind if we go to a bank?

40:44.606 --> 40:46.540
No, it's good. It's good.
Klein's buying.

40:46.608 --> 40:50.177
- You got this one, right?
- Pay increase.
