04:14.003 --> 04:15.922
[Crew] I fear the same will
be said about our film

04:15.922 --> 04:17.674
when we're finished too.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.810
[Crew] Were you?

34:39.869 --> 34:44.373
[Pirahã Man] Dan came here.
He wanted to learn Pirahã.

34:44.582 --> 34:48.795
I speak to Dan,
'Pirahã is very difficult.'

36:12.253 --> 36:15.464
[Pirahã Man] The American spoke.
'I will bring medicine.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.008
The kids won't be sick.'

36:18.134 --> 36:22.180
The American spoke,
'I will talk to my God.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.767
Your kids won't be sick.'

36:26.934 --> 36:33.774
So we spoke.
'Okay. Talk to your God.'

50:05.794 --> 50:07.087
[Crew] Why do we?

53:19.279 --> 53:21.781
[T.N. Pandit] These
are my field notes.

53:21.781 --> 53:23.575
Old ones.

53:30.916 --> 53:33.043
I am the only one
who has been inside

53:33.043 --> 53:34.920
the Sentinelese settlement.

53:36.963 --> 53:40.508
No other anthropologist
has landed there since.

53:42.052 --> 53:44.304
This happened only once.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.726
Years of friendly visits

53:49.726 --> 53:52.229
had softened their attitude.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.194
I like this picture.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.197
You see, I'm smiling
and he is also smiling.

54:07.577 --> 54:10.664
It was a matter of surprise
that they had come forward.

54:12.415 --> 54:15.794
Every one of us was
handing over coconuts,

54:16.419 --> 54:18.672
like it was a
prize distribution.

54:19.881 --> 54:21.591
Then at one point

54:21.591 --> 54:24.511
one of the boys
took out a knife

54:25.220 --> 54:27.973
and made a carving motion.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.187
[T.N. Pandit] Perhaps
trying to say,

54:34.729 --> 54:38.400
that if you stay on, I
will carve out your heart.

54:40.902 --> 54:42.529
I got the hint.

54:43.238 --> 54:44.739
See, they are human beings.

54:44.739 --> 54:46.825
They are not stupid guys.

54:46.825 --> 54:49.995
And that's why
they're keeping us away.

54:51.121 --> 54:54.416
Historically, they have seen
what happened to other tribes.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.254
Great Andamanese,
they have disappeared.

55:05.552 --> 55:08.638
It has not done any
great good to the Onge.

55:25.780 --> 55:28.241
'Tomayu' — the evil spirit.

55:28.241 --> 55:30.577
Do you believe in 'Tomayu'?

55:30.577 --> 55:33.163
[Sentinelese Man] Of course
we believe in him.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.331
He constantly troubles us.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.666
[T.N. Pandit] It troubles you?
But, how?

55:36.666 --> 55:40.295
- He captures men.
- Captures?

55:40.295 --> 55:44.007
[Sentinelese Man] That's why
we are scared to go far.

55:44.007 --> 55:47.635
- What do you call it?
-"Tomayu."

55:49.971 --> 55:52.766
[T.N. Pandit] Does it
rise from the sea?

55:52.766 --> 55:58.104
[Sentinelese Man] He may rise
from the sea or from anywhere.

55:58.104 --> 56:02.609
He comes hunting for men.

56:07.447 --> 56:10.825
- And then?
- He takes them away.

56:10.825 --> 56:16.623
- Where?
- To his place.

56:24.923 --> 56:26.800
[T.N. Pandit] Today you
are given a coconut,

56:26.800 --> 56:28.718
tomorrow you are
given something else.

56:38.478 --> 56:41.231
[T.N. Pandit] This is a popular
picture of the Sentinelese.

56:42.107 --> 56:44.359
But the photographer told me,

56:44.359 --> 56:46.611
he had taken
several hundred pictures.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.448
They were not only
aiming arrows at us,

56:50.448 --> 56:52.075
they were doing other things.

56:52.867 --> 56:55.787
Some pictures where they
were standing doing nothing

56:55.787 --> 56:56.955
and watching us...

56:57.414 --> 56:59.958
would have been interesting.

57:00.458 --> 57:03.086
But what is
published is sensational,

57:03.753 --> 57:05.630
showing them as violent...

57:05.630 --> 57:07.257
ready to shoot.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.763
Violence is not
only killing someone,

57:13.763 --> 57:16.141
violence is — you
are made to do things

57:16.141 --> 57:18.143
against your will.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.770
Violence is using...

57:21.104 --> 57:23.773
harsh words while
describing them.

57:26.901 --> 57:28.945
I am shouting myself hoarse,

57:30.196 --> 57:31.197
protect them.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.160
Outsiders coming there,

57:35.160 --> 57:37.370
with friendship
in their hearts,

57:37.370 --> 57:39.372
can do a lot of damage.

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:45.121
[Pirahã Man] We don't want
anything up high.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.832
We want things that
are on the ground.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.543
God is a foreigner.

01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:55.131
We don't know Him.
We don't want Him.

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:15.951
[Crew] Who was that for John?

01:43:20.402 --> 01:43:22.404

Cotter Media Group.
