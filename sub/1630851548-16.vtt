09:48.333 --> 09:49.700
IN THE PREP MUST BE CRAZY.

09:49.766 --> 09:51.100
>> I LEARNED THE HOST HAS TO BE

09:51.166 --> 09:53.300
A GOOD GENERAL LIST BUT YOU

09:53.366 --> 09:54.700
DON'T NEED TO KNOW EVERY

09:54.766 --> 09:55.933
PLATFORM DRIVER FROM PERU OR

09:56.000 --> 09:56.666
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIER AT THE

09:56.733 --> 09:57.800
NORWAY, THAT'S FOR THE PEOPLE AT

09:57.866 --> 09:59.733
THE VENUE, YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE

09:59.800 --> 10:00.300
THE BIG PICTURE.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.533
>> Bill: NOW WE ARE GOING TO

10:02.600 --> 10:06.666
HAVE IT IN TOKYO IN JUST A

10:06.733 --> 10:07.633
MONTH, THIS IS A BIG

10:07.700 --> 10:07.933
CONTROVERSY.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.733
I HAVE NO DOG IN THIS FIGHT, I

10:08.800 --> 10:11.966
DON'T WATCH IT AND I KNOW YOU'RE

10:12.033 --> 10:13.700
NOT DOING IT.

10:13.766 --> 10:15.700
>> IT FREES UP A LOT OF TIME FOR

10:15.766 --> 10:15.933
ME.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.266
>> Bill: IT REALLY DOES, IT

10:18.333 --> 10:20.033
TAKES TOO LONG, THERE'S TOO MANY

10:20.100 --> 10:20.800
BACK STORIES ABOUT WHAT THEY

10:20.866 --> 10:24.033
WENT THROUGH TO GET THERE.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.433
IF THEY JUST CUT IT DOWN, IT'S

10:26.500 --> 10:27.233
LIKE ALL THESE STREAMING SHOWS

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
THAT SHOULD BE JUST A MOVIE,

10:29.366 --> 10:31.900
JUST MAKE IT INTO ONE FUCKING

10:31.966 --> 10:32.100
MOVIE.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.566
>> THEY SPENT A BILLION DOLLARS

10:33.633 --> 10:35.566
OR MORE FOR THE RIGHTS AND IT

10:35.633 --> 10:36.233
DOMINATES THE RATINGS AT A TIME

10:36.300 --> 10:39.066
WHEN EVERY THING IS FRAGMENTED.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.000
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CUTS

10:40.066 --> 10:40.233
THROUGH.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.866
>> Bill: YOU THINK IT SHOULD

10:43.933 --> 10:44.733
TAKE PLACE BECAUSE WE AREN'T

10:44.800 --> 10:46.700
GOING TO HAVE A CROWD?

10:46.766 --> 10:48.333
>> IT SHOULD BE POSTPONED, NOT

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
CANCELED, IF THEY POSTPONE IT

10:49.466 --> 10:51.733
UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 2022, AS A

10:51.800 --> 10:53.366
ONE-OFF, THEN IT WOULD GO BACK

10:53.433 --> 10:55.100
TO THE WAY IT WAS PRIOR TO THE

10:55.166 --> 10:56.200
90s, THE WINTER AND SUMMER

10:56.266 --> 10:57.933
GAMES TOOK PLACE EVERY FOUR

10:58.000 --> 10:59.900
YEARS IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.100
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT

11:01.166 --> 11:03.033
MAKES SENSE BUT YOU GOT TO

11:03.100 --> 11:03.633
UNDERSTAND, THE IOC HOLDS ALL

11:03.700 --> 11:07.766
THE CARDS.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.933
>> Bill: THE INTERNATIONAL --

11:09.000 --> 11:10.266
>> THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC

11:10.333 --> 11:10.533
COMMITTEE.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.366
>> Bill: EVERY TIME I SEE

11:11.433 --> 11:13.166
THEIR NAME IN THE HEADLINE IT'S

11:13.233 --> 11:14.833
SOMETHING SHADY, IS THAT WRONG?

11:14.900 --> 11:17.466
>> THEY HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR

11:17.533 --> 11:19.533
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, THEY WILL

11:19.600 --> 11:20.766
BE BACK IN BEIJING FOR THE

11:20.833 --> 11:24.666
WINTER OLYMPICS, THEY WERE IN

11:24.733 --> 11:25.666
SOCHI FOR 2018.

11:25.733 --> 11:26.400
>> Bill: YOU'RE SAYING WE

11:26.466 --> 11:27.900
SHOULD HAVE BOYCOTTED ALL OF

11:27.966 --> 11:28.900
THESE?

11:28.966 --> 11:30.233
SPEAK OF THE BOYCOTTS MOSTLY

11:30.300 --> 11:31.266
HURT THE ATHLETES RATHER THAN

11:31.333 --> 11:32.000
THE GOVERNMENT THEY ARE AIMED

11:32.066 --> 11:32.266
AT.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.200
>> Bill: BUT THEY HAVE TO WORK

11:35.266 --> 11:35.700
WITH THESE GOVERNMENTS.

11:35.766 --> 11:38.166
>> IT'S A DIFFICULT TIGHTROPE

11:38.233 --> 11:40.666
WALK FOR NBC BECAUSE UNLIKE

11:40.733 --> 11:41.866
OTHER ENTITIES THAT COVER IT,

11:41.933 --> 11:43.033
THE NETWORK THAT CARRIES THE

11:43.100 --> 11:43.800
LIMBIC'S OR ANY SPORTS EVENT HAS

11:43.866 --> 11:47.133
INVESTED IN LOT OF MONEY IN THE

11:47.200 --> 11:48.333
RIGHTS AND THEY WANT PEOPLE TO

11:48.400 --> 11:50.266
FEEL GOOD ABOUT WATCHING IT BUT

11:50.333 --> 11:51.466
MY FEELING ALWAYS WAS YOU NEED

11:51.533 --> 11:52.566
TO AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THE

11:52.633 --> 11:53.533
ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM AND I

11:53.600 --> 11:55.633
TRIED AS BEST I COULD TO TUG ON

11:55.700 --> 11:56.766
THE OTHER END OF THAT ROPE BUT

11:56.833 --> 11:58.900
THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY TOUCHY

11:58.966 --> 12:03.000
ABOUT POSSIBLY OFFENDING THE IO

12:03.066 --> 12:03.166
IOC.

12:03.233 --> 12:04.233
>> Bill: WASN'T CHINA TRYING

12:04.300 --> 12:06.400
TO GET YOU BANNED?

12:06.466 --> 12:09.700
>> 1996 EVEN BEFORE THE 2008

12:09.766 --> 12:11.466
GAMES IN BEIJING, STARTING IN

12:11.533 --> 12:12.133
THE OPENING CEREMONY I POINTED

12:12.200 --> 12:13.666
OUT TO THE SOVIET UNION HAD JUST

12:13.733 --> 12:15.966
BROKEN UP THAT IF ANY NATION HAD

12:16.033 --> 12:17.266
THE RESOURCES AND THAT

12:17.333 --> 12:17.900
MOTIVATION TO REPLICATE WHAT THE

12:17.966 --> 12:20.400
OLD EASTERN BLOCK DID WITH

12:20.466 --> 12:21.800
SYSTEMATIC CHEATING -- IS NOT TO

12:21.866 --> 12:22.933
SAY AMERICAN ATHLETES DON'T

12:23.000 --> 12:24.933
CHEAT BUT THEY DO IT ON THEIR

12:25.000 --> 12:26.900
OWN OR WITH ROBUST SCIENTISTS,

12:26.966 --> 12:28.333
NOT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE

12:28.400 --> 12:28.866
USOC OF THE UNITED STATES

12:28.933 --> 12:30.066
GOVERNMENT -- CHINA HAD A

12:30.133 --> 12:31.133
MOTIVATION TO DO IT, SEVERAL

12:31.200 --> 12:33.133
ATHLETES HAD ALREADY BEEN

12:33.200 --> 12:33.366
CAUGHT.

12:33.433 --> 12:34.400
I POINTED OUT THAT THEY WANTED

12:34.466 --> 12:36.800
TO HOST THE 2,000 OLYMPICS, THIS

12:36.866 --> 12:39.433
WAS BEFORE THEY GOT THE 2008

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
OLYMPICS, THE 2,000 OLYMPICS

12:40.566 --> 12:41.733
WENT TO SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, BUT

12:41.800 --> 12:42.666
THAT CONCERNS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS

12:42.733 --> 12:44.566
AND THE THREAT TO TAIWAN AND ALL

12:44.633 --> 12:48.700
THE REST HAD SCRATCHED THEIR

12:48.766 --> 12:49.300
BID.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.300
THE INTERNET HAD JUST STARTED

12:51.366 --> 12:52.666
BUT THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN

12:52.733 --> 12:53.600
DIRECTED BY BEIJING TO HAVE ME

12:53.666 --> 12:56.133
FIRED UNLESS I ISSUED A PUBLIC

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
APOLOGY IN PRIME TIME.

12:58.266 --> 13:00.733
NEITHER OF WHICH HAPPENED.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.733
>> Bill: YOU COULD'VE BEEN

13:02.800 --> 13:03.233
PATIENT ZERO FOR GETTING

13:03.300 --> 13:03.666
CANCELED.

13:03.733 --> 13:07.533
>> YEAH.

13:07.600 --> 13:07.900
[LAUGHTER]

13:07.966 --> 13:12.666
YOU SEE, PUTIN WAS MORE STEALTH

13:12.733 --> 13:15.500
IN SOCHI, HE JUST GAVE ME

13:15.566 --> 13:15.766
PINK EYE.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.833
>> Bill: I REMEMBER THAT.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.233
>> BRUTAL.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.633
>> Bill: WHAT A TROOPER YOU

13:19.700 --> 13:20.033
WERE.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.633
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PISSED ME

13:21.700 --> 13:23.966
OFF ABOUT MISSING THE SHOWS, I

13:24.033 --> 13:24.633
NEVER MISSED A SHOW IN 28 YEARS

13:24.700 --> 13:27.233
ON TELEVISION AND I COULD'VE

13:27.300 --> 13:28.166
DONE -- I DEFINITELY COULD HAVE

13:28.233 --> 13:30.766
DONE BOTH OF THEM BUT KEEPING ME

13:30.833 --> 13:31.400
OUT OF THE SECOND WEEK -- LET'S

13:31.466 --> 13:33.566
NOT GET INTO IT.

13:33.633 --> 13:37.100
>> I THINK YOU PRETTY MUCH

13:37.166 --> 13:37.400
COVERED AT.

13:37.466 --> 13:39.533
>> Bill: YEAH, I'M PISSED OFF.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.900
>> ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE IOC.

13:43.966 --> 13:45.666
ALMOST EVERYBODY, 70% OF

13:45.733 --> 13:47.933
JAPANESE CITIZENS, ALL THE

13:48.000 --> 13:48.666
HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS, "THE

13:48.733 --> 13:49.333
NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE"

13:49.400 --> 13:49.933
TODAY, THEY ALL SAY IT'S NOT A

13:50.000 --> 13:52.100
GOOD IDEA.

13:52.166 --> 13:55.033
IT EITHER SHOULD BE CANCELED OR

13:55.100 --> 13:55.800
MORE LIKELY POSTPONED BUT ALL

13:55.866 --> 13:56.700
THE CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN IN

13:56.766 --> 13:58.700
FAVOR OF THE IOC.

13:58.766 --> 14:00.466
IF THE OLYMPICS ARE HELD, ALL

14:00.533 --> 14:02.033
THE LOSSES COME ALL THE COST

14:02.100 --> 14:03.600
OVERRUNS, THEY FALL ON THE

14:03.666 --> 14:05.866
OLYMPIC ORGANIZING COMMITTEE OF

14:05.933 --> 14:07.300
TOKYO, NONE OF THAT, NONE OF THE

14:07.366 --> 14:09.033
BRUNT OF THAT IS BORNE BY THE

14:09.100 --> 14:11.100
IOC, PLUS IF THE GAMES TAKE

14:11.166 --> 14:13.600
PLACE AND NBC TELEVISE IS THEM,

14:13.666 --> 14:15.266
AND THE IOC COLLECTS EVERY LAST

14:15.333 --> 14:17.333
PENNY OF THE BROADCAST RIGHTS.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.600
YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO HAVE

14:18.666 --> 14:20.466
THE SAME VIEW OF THIS IS THE

14:20.533 --> 14:21.133
REST OF THE WORLD DOES.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.533
>> Bill: IT'S FUNNY WITH

14:22.600 --> 14:24.200
SPORTS, WE WANTED TO BE PURE AND

14:24.266 --> 14:27.266
IT'S ALWAYS MORE THAN ANYTHING

14:27.333 --> 14:27.866
ELSE GOING TO BE INTERMINGLED

14:27.933 --> 14:31.266
WITH POLITICS.

14:31.333 --> 14:31.933
THE ALL-STAR GAME THAT WAS GOING

14:32.000 --> 14:36.700
TO BE IN ATLANTA, WHEN IS THAT?

14:36.766 --> 14:37.266
>> IT'S IN JULY.

14:37.333 --> 14:42.500
>> THEY MOVED IT BECAUSE GEORGIA

14:42.566 --> 14:43.300
PASSED WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

14:43.366 --> 14:45.633
THINK OUR VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS

14:45.700 --> 14:46.466
AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ARGUMENT

14:46.533 --> 14:48.833
BUT TO ME THEY ARE VOTER

14:48.900 --> 14:51.266
SUPPRESSION LAWS AND I'M

14:51.333 --> 14:53.400
NORMALLY NOT FOR BOYCOTTS OR

14:53.466 --> 14:55.200
MOVING THINGS BECAUSE OF THAT,

14:55.266 --> 14:56.233
IF YOU LIKE THIS IS AN ISSUE

14:56.300 --> 14:58.033
THAT TRANSCENDS OTHER ISSUES.

14:58.100 --> 15:04.066
THIS IS ABOUT LOSING OUR

15:04.133 --> 15:04.300
ECONOMY.

15:04.366 --> 15:05.433
>> THAT WAS THE WAY BASEBALL

15:05.500 --> 15:06.933
FELT ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
PRESSURE BECAUSE THEY KNEW MANY

15:08.066 --> 15:09.000
OF THE ALL-STAR PLAYERS WOULD

15:09.066 --> 15:11.500
REFUSE TO PLAY IN THE GAME AND

15:11.566 --> 15:12.466
THE NATIONAL LEAGUE MANAGER DAVE

15:12.533 --> 15:14.133
ROBERTS OF THE DODGERS HAD SAID

15:14.200 --> 15:15.733
HE WAS CONSIDERING NOT COMING TO

15:15.800 --> 15:17.633
ATLANTA FOR THE GAME.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.866
ROB MANFRED THE COMMISSIONER WAS

15:18.933 --> 15:20.866
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.633
IT WOULD BE A P.R. NIGHTMARE OF

15:22.700 --> 15:23.266
SEVERAL OF THE BEST PLAYERS

15:23.333 --> 15:24.733
DIDN'T SHOW UP SO THE MOVE HE

15:24.800 --> 15:28.200
MADE WAS PREEMPTIVE, TAKE IT TO

15:28.266 --> 15:28.533
DENVER.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.266
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT

15:30.333 --> 15:32.000
LACKS SOME OF THE MORAL CLARITY

15:32.066 --> 15:34.633
THAT YOU ASSOCIATE WITH OTHER

15:34.700 --> 15:34.900
BOYCOTTS.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.933
NO SUPER BOWL IN PHOENIX IN THE

15:37.000 --> 15:39.266
EARLY 90s BECAUSE ARIZONA

15:39.333 --> 15:41.700
DIDN'T HAVE AN MLK HOLIDAY, THE

15:41.766 --> 15:43.266
PGA OF AMERICA PULLS NEXT YEAR'S

15:43.333 --> 15:45.533
PGA CHAMPIONSHIP, THE ONE JUST

15:45.600 --> 15:47.900
WON BY PHIL MICKELSON FROM THE

15:47.966 --> 15:48.466
BEDMINSTER COURSE,

15:48.533 --> 15:49.000
DONALD TRUMP'S COURSE IN

15:49.066 --> 15:50.933
NEW JERSEY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE

15:51.000 --> 15:51.866
JANUARY 6 INSURRECTION.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.900
THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE

15:53.966 --> 15:56.666
OBVIOUS, THEY MAKE PERFECT SENS

15:56.733 --> 15:57.400
SENSE.

15:57.466 --> 15:58.033
HERE TO THE PUBLIC THESE REASONS

15:58.100 --> 16:00.766
ARE LITTLE MUDDY.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.300
THEY DON'T GRASP OF THE AS

16:03.366 --> 16:04.600
READILY.

16:04.666 --> 16:05.666
>> Bill: MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE

16:05.733 --> 16:09.466
TALKED TO, THEN.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.466
>> I GET AT.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.100
>> Bill: WE LACK MORAL CLARITY

16:12.166 --> 16:14.733
ABOUT WHETHER VOTING SHOULD

16:14.800 --> 16:14.933
COUNT.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.233
>> THEY CALL THEM VOTER

16:17.300 --> 16:19.100
INTEGRITY LAWS AND ON THE OTHER

16:19.166 --> 16:20.666
HAND THOSE WHO REGARD

16:20.733 --> 16:21.833
DONALD TRUMP AS THEIR NORTHSTAR

16:21.900 --> 16:24.900
HAVE A VERY PECULIAR DEFINITION

16:24.966 --> 16:25.666
OF INTEGRITY.

16:25.733 --> 16:29.433
WE KNOW THE REASON HERE IS WEIRD

16:29.500 --> 16:30.566
RIGHT WING VIRTUAL SIGNALING

16:30.633 --> 16:33.366
LIKE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

16:33.433 --> 16:35.000
BECAUSE TRUMP THOUGHT THE

16:35.066 --> 16:36.633
ELECTION WAS FIXED AND THE ONLY

16:36.700 --> 16:37.233
EVIDENCE OF ANYBODY TRYING TO

16:37.300 --> 16:39.766
STEAL IT AND IT'S ON TAPE IS

16:39.833 --> 16:41.266
TRUMP HIMSELF.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.266
>> Bill: THAT IS THE VERY

16:43.333 --> 16:44.566
STATE OR TRUMP DID CALL THE GUY

16:44.633 --> 16:46.433
AND SAY COULD YOU FIND MORE

16:46.500 --> 16:46.766
VOTES?

16:46.833 --> 16:47.966
LOOK UNDER THE COUCH, THERE

16:48.033 --> 16:51.500
MIGHT BE 11,000 VOTES.

16:51.566 --> 16:55.400
AND BRAD RATZENBERGER WHO WAS A

16:55.466 --> 16:57.033
REPUBLICAN WHO IN MANY WAYS TO

16:57.100 --> 16:58.233
SAVE THIS REPUBLIC BECAUSE IF WE

16:58.300 --> 16:59.400
HAD WOULD'VE LOST THAT STATE OF

16:59.466 --> 17:00.000
ARIZONA, IT COULD'VE GONE IN A

17:00.066 --> 17:03.466
VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

17:03.533 --> 17:04.866
HE STOOD UP AS SOME OF THE

17:04.933 --> 17:06.300
COURTS DID, WE ARE GOING TO TALK

17:06.366 --> 17:07.366
ABOUT THIS ON THE PANEL BUT THIS

17:07.433 --> 17:08.966
IS WHAT IS DISAPPEARING IN THIS

17:09.033 --> 17:11.200
COUNTRY BEHIND THE SCENES.

17:11.266 --> 17:14.133
THEY ARE SLOWLY -- THEY DIDN'T

17:14.200 --> 17:15.300
SAY AFTER THEY LOST OH, WELL, I

17:15.366 --> 17:17.266
GUESS WE SHOULDN'T TRY TO CHEAT

17:17.333 --> 17:19.500
AGAIN, THEY SAID OKAY, I SEE HOW

17:19.566 --> 17:21.766
WE CAN HAVE TO DO IT BETTER NEXT

17:21.833 --> 17:24.066
TIME.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.000
>> AGREED TO.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.433
IF THIS IS NOT JIM CROW 2.0,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
WHICH MIGHT BE HYPERBOLIC -- THE

17:30.566 --> 17:31.933
IDEA, ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES

17:32.000 --> 17:32.500
ARE COMING FROM REPUBLICANS

17:32.566 --> 17:34.866
AROUND THE COUNTRY, SOME 40

17:34.933 --> 17:35.100
STATES.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.433
THE IDEA IS TO GAIN WHATEVER

17:36.500 --> 17:38.233
EDGE THEY CAN GAIN.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.633
WILL THESE LAWS TO STOP ANYONE

17:39.700 --> 17:41.500
WHO IS DETERMINED TO VOTE FROM

17:41.566 --> 17:42.033
VOTING?

17:42.100 --> 17:42.200
NO.

17:42.266 --> 17:42.800
WILL IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

17:42.866 --> 17:47.466
FOR SOME PEOPLE AND WILL THEY BE

17:47.533 --> 17:48.466
DISPROPORTIONALLY DEMOCRATIC

17:48.533 --> 17:48.700
VOTERS?

17:48.766 --> 17:48.866
YES.

17:48.933 --> 17:49.533
>> Bill: IS NOT JUST THAT IT'S

17:49.600 --> 17:53.733
THAT THERE IS NO MORE BRAD

17:53.800 --> 17:54.333
RATZENBERGER IN GEORGIA, THEY

17:54.400 --> 17:55.900
GOT RID OF THAT GUY, THAT'S WHAT

17:55.966 --> 17:57.633
THEY ARE DOING.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.033
>> THE STATE LEGISLATURE IS

17:59.100 --> 18:00.000
CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS, IT

18:00.066 --> 18:01.133
CAN OVERSEE ELECTIONS AND

18:01.200 --> 18:02.366
OVERTURN CERTAIN THINGS BUT

18:02.433 --> 18:05.300
MEANWHILE THEY MOVE IT TO

18:05.366 --> 18:05.866
DENVER, 9% AFRICAN-AMERICAN

18:05.933 --> 18:09.733
POPULATION, 51% IN ATLANTA.

18:09.800 --> 18:14.466
>> Bill: THAT'S MACRO.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.066
>> I GET YOUR POINT, I JUST

18:16.133 --> 18:16.800
DON'T KNOW IF THE POINT

18:16.866 --> 18:18.433
RESONATES AS WELL AS IT MIGHT'VE

18:18.500 --> 18:18.733
INTENDED TO.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.100
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE

18:21.166 --> 18:21.866
FOR.

18:21.933 --> 18:23.433
I SEE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL NOW

18:23.500 --> 18:28.600
IS GOING TO COUNT THE RECORDS OF

18:28.666 --> 18:33.633
THE NEGRO LEAGUES WITH REGULAR

18:33.700 --> 18:34.200
MAJOR LEAGUES IT'S GOING TO

18:34.266 --> 18:38.200
BLEND THEM IN WITH STATISTICS.

18:38.266 --> 18:39.766
IT COULD BE IF THEY FIND OUT

18:39.833 --> 18:40.800
JUDGE GIBSON AT 800 HOME RUNS,

18:40.866 --> 18:43.266
HE WOULD BE THE ALL-TIME LEADER,

18:43.333 --> 18:44.833
WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT?

18:44.900 --> 18:47.233
>> HERE IS MY FEELING, VERY

18:47.300 --> 18:48.366
OFTEN IF YOU ARE IN GENERAL

18:48.433 --> 18:50.233
SYMPATHY OR AGREEMENT WITH A

18:50.300 --> 18:51.466
CAUSE, THEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

18:51.533 --> 18:52.366
JUST NOD AND A SCENT THAT'S

18:52.433 --> 18:54.466
ANYTHING THAT'S PRESENTED UNDER

18:54.533 --> 18:56.266
THE HEADING OF THAT BECAUSE.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.000
>> Bill: NOT ON THIS SHOW.

18:58.066 --> 18:58.266
[LAUGHTER]

18:58.333 --> 19:01.100
>> YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.900
I WAS THE MC OF THE OPENING OF

19:03.966 --> 19:08.700
THE NEGRO LEAGUES M MUSEUM IN

19:08.766 --> 19:09.800
KANSAS CITY, IT'S ONE OF THE

19:09.866 --> 19:10.700
GREAT MUSEUMS IN THE COUNTRY,

19:10.766 --> 19:12.900
WONDERFUL IN EVERY WAY, THE

19:12.966 --> 19:14.800
NEGRO LEAGUES DERIVE THEIR

19:14.866 --> 19:16.466
MEANING FROM THE INJUSTICE THAT

19:16.533 --> 19:18.966
WAS IMPOSED UPON THEM AND FROM

19:19.033 --> 19:19.766
ANYONE INVOLVED TRIUMPHING OVER

19:19.833 --> 19:22.233
THAT INJUSTICE.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.766
WE CAN'T LEARN ENOUGH ABOUT THE

19:23.833 --> 19:24.866
NEGRO LEAGUES, I THINK I READ

19:24.933 --> 19:25.733
EVERY BOOK AND WATCHED EVERY

19:25.800 --> 19:27.266
DOCUMENTARY THAT HAS BEEN MADE

19:27.333 --> 19:29.666
ABOUT IT, IT'S A GLORIOUS STORY.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.400
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF BIG

19:31.466 --> 19:32.866
LEAGUE HISTORY BUT YOU CAN'T

19:32.933 --> 19:35.866
AUTOMATICALLY JUST BLEND THOSE

19:35.933 --> 19:36.633
STATS WITH BIG-LEAGUE STATS,

19:36.700 --> 19:38.066
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THE

19:38.133 --> 19:40.033
NEGRO LEAGUES WEREN'T AS GOOD,

19:40.100 --> 19:40.666
IN SOME CASES THEY WERE BETTER

19:40.733 --> 19:44.800
THAN THEIR CONTEMPORARIES AMONG

19:44.866 --> 19:45.366
WHITE MAJOR LEAGUERS.

19:45.433 --> 19:49.600
A GENERATION OR TWO DOWN THE

19:49.666 --> 19:50.366
ROAD, IF THAT'S ALL YOU'RE

19:50.433 --> 19:51.966
LOOKING AT, YOU WILL HAVE LOST

19:52.033 --> 19:53.000
THE MEANING OF THE

19:53.066 --> 19:53.433
NEGRO LEAGUES.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.833
AT VARIOUS TIMES THERE WERE

19:54.900 --> 19:56.800
THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT

19:56.866 --> 19:59.300
NEGRO LEAGUES OPERATING

19:59.366 --> 19:59.866
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND EVEN THE

19:59.933 --> 20:01.166
RESEARCHERS WHO HAVE DONE AN

20:01.233 --> 20:02.300
EXHAUSTIVE JOB HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

20:02.366 --> 20:04.300
TO TRACK DOWN ALL OF THE STATS.

20:04.366 --> 20:06.933
THEY'VE GOT JOSH GIBSON WITH 113

20:07.000 --> 20:09.833
HOME RUNS, BY LEGEND HE HAD

20:09.900 --> 20:10.333
ABOUT 800.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.933
THE OLD SAYING, WHEN THE FACTS

20:12.000 --> 20:14.033
AND LEGEND COLLIDE, PRINT THE

20:14.100 --> 20:14.700
LEGEND.

20:14.766 --> 20:16.000
IN THIS CASE, THE LEGEND IS

20:16.066 --> 20:17.966
ALMOST CERTAINLY CLOSER TO THE

20:18.033 --> 20:18.800
TRUTH.

20:18.866 --> 20:19.933
WHY SHOULD A FEW AT-BATS THAT A

20:20.000 --> 20:21.266
17-YEAR-OLD WILLIE MAYS HAD A

20:21.333 --> 20:24.800
1948 FOR THE BIRMINGHAM BLACK

20:24.866 --> 20:28.000
BEAR IN SLOWER HIS LIFETIME

20:28.066 --> 20:33.800
BATTING AVERAGE FROM .302 TO .3

20:33.866 --> 20:39.300
.301.

20:39.366 --> 20:39.900
THEY SHOULD HAVE AN EXHAUSTIVE

20:39.966 --> 20:42.066
REFERENCE AND YOU TAKE EVERY

20:42.133 --> 20:44.500
NEGRO LEAGUER AND YOU PUT THAT

20:44.566 --> 20:46.400
REFERENCE ALPHABETICALLY

20:46.466 --> 20:49.600
WHEREVER YOU BELONG, JOSH GIBSON

20:49.666 --> 20:50.400
WOULD COME BETWEEN BOB GIBSON

20:50.466 --> 20:51.700
AND KURT GIBSON AND YOU WOULD

20:51.766 --> 20:55.000
SEE HIS STATS.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.000
>> Bill: YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,

20:57.066 --> 20:58.066
THIS IS THE KIND OF COMMON SENSE

20:58.133 --> 20:59.866
WING MAN I NEED ON HBO AND NOW I

20:59.933 --> 21:02.233
HAVE HIM!

21:02.300 --> 21:03.866
BOB COSTAS, LOOK FOR IT LATER

21:03.933 --> 21:06.100

21:43.166 --> 21:44.100
WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS

21:44.166 --> 21:45.833
OVER THERE, I'M A LITTLE

21:45.900 --> 21:47.200
WORRIED, WE USED TO USE THE WORD

21:47.266 --> 21:49.066
OF SLOW-MOVING COUP EVEN BEFORE

21:49.133 --> 21:49.800
TRUMP WAS ELECTED, I'M GOING TO

21:49.866 --> 21:51.033
HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT.

21:51.100 --> 21:55.633
I FEEL LIKE IT'S TAKING MORE

21:55.700 --> 21:57.833
THAN ONE ELECTION CYCLE AND WHEN

21:57.900 --> 22:00.066
ELECTIONS BECOME ABOUT THE

22:00.133 --> 22:00.966
ELECTION ITSELF, THEN YOU LOST

22:01.033 --> 22:03.566
YOUR COUNTRY.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.966
THEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY A

22:06.033 --> 22:06.966
DEMOCRACY ANYMORE.

22:07.033 --> 22:09.533
THE FACT THAT TODAY WE FOUND OUT

22:09.600 --> 22:10.366
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO

22:10.433 --> 22:11.533
COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO WHAT

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6TH -- NOT

22:13.666 --> 22:20.800
THAT IT WAS A MYSTERY, RIGHT?

22:20.866 --> 22:22.066
LIZ CHENEY THE ONE PROMINENT

22:22.133 --> 22:23.233
REPUBLICAN WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST

IT, SHE'S GONE, THEY EXILED HER.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.200
AS I WAS SAYING TO BOB, THEY ARE

22:29.266 --> 22:31.700
REPLACING THE PEOPLE WHO SAVE

22:31.766 --> 22:32.733
THE LAST ELECTION, BY A

22:32.800 --> 22:32.966
THUMBNAIL.

22:33.033 --> 22:36.366
THEY ARE REPLACING THEM WITH THE

22:36.433 --> 22:39.033
STOP THE STEEL PEOPLE.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.366
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2024

22:40.433 --> 22:44.500
AND WHAT DO WE DO TO STOP IT?

22:44.566 --> 22:46.566
IT'S NOT THE SAME SCENARIO

22:46.633 --> 22:47.666
ALREADY WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND

22:47.733 --> 22:48.566
THE SCENES.

22:48.633 --> 22:51.433
>> I DON'T THINK IN EARLY 2021

22:51.500 --> 22:53.233
WE CAN KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

22:53.300 --> 22:56.966
2022 ELECTIONS, AND I DO THINK

22:57.033 --> 22:57.866
THE DEGREE WHICH THE G.O.P. HAS

22:57.933 --> 23:01.100
GONE OFF THE RAILS DOES MITIGATE

23:01.166 --> 23:06.466
ITS CHANCES OF COMING BACK.

23:06.533 --> 23:09.400
I ALSO THINK THAT POLITICAL

23:09.466 --> 23:11.400
SCIENCE HAS ARGUED THERE IS A

23:11.466 --> 23:12.566
CONSIDERABLE RISK OF BACKLASH

23:12.633 --> 23:14.000
AND TRULY WHAT HAS OFTEN

23:14.066 --> 23:15.666
SUPPRESS THE VOTE HAS NOT BEEN

23:15.733 --> 23:17.700
VOTER I.D. LAWS, IT'S BEEN

23:17.766 --> 23:19.566
APATHY.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.200
ONE GOOD MECHANISM TO COUNTERACT

23:21.266 --> 23:22.266
THAT APATHY IS WHEN PEOPLE SAY

23:22.333 --> 23:24.100
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUPPRESS

23:24.166 --> 23:24.900
YOUR VOTE.

23:24.966 --> 23:25.700
>> Bill: I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

23:25.766 --> 23:27.733
ACTUAL VOTING, I'M TALKING ABOUT

23:27.800 --> 23:29.033
THEY ARE CHANGING BEHIND THE

23:29.100 --> 23:30.466
SCENES THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT THE

23:30.533 --> 23:31.866
VOTES, THIS IS WHAT STALIN USED

23:31.933 --> 23:33.566
TO SAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO

23:33.633 --> 23:35.466
VOTES, IT MATTERS WHO COUNTS THE

23:35.533 --> 23:35.666
VOTES.

23:35.733 --> 23:39.100
THIS IS WHAT IS CHANGING.

23:39.166 --> 23:41.066
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE TOO

23:41.133 --> 23:43.266
COMPLACENT ABOUT NOW, WE WON THE

23:43.333 --> 23:44.533
LAST ONE, BIDEN PRESIDENT BUT

23:44.600 --> 23:46.466
BEHIND THE SCENES NEXT TIME,

23:46.533 --> 23:47.833
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT

23:47.900 --> 23:49.900
BRAD RATZENBERGER GUY THERE.

23:49.966 --> 23:51.833
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

23:51.900 --> 23:53.566
COUNT THE VOTES, THE

23:53.633 --> 23:54.200
LEGISLATURES SOME TIME NOW HAVE

23:54.266 --> 23:56.000
PRECEDENT, THEY CAN TAKE IT AWAY

23:56.066 --> 23:58.266
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO FORMALLY

23:58.333 --> 24:00.433
WERE BIPARTISAN COUNTING THE

24:00.500 --> 24:00.933
VOTES.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.866
>> THE DEMOCRATS KNOW WHAT'S

24:01.933 --> 24:06.333
HAPPENING TO THEM, I KNOW

24:06.400 --> 24:06.833
DEMOCRATIC LAWYERS, FRED

24:06.900 --> 24:12.100
WERTHEIMER IS FIGHTING CONGRESS,

24:12.166 --> 24:14.566
PELOSI, SCHUMER, PEOPLE ARE

24:14.633 --> 24:17.666
PANICKED BUT IN GEORGIA THE

24:17.733 --> 24:19.200
SECRETARY OF STATE COUNTS THE

24:19.266 --> 24:20.833
VOTES IN THE LEGISLATURE SAYS

24:20.900 --> 24:21.600
WE'LL JUST DECIDE AND IF YOU

24:21.666 --> 24:22.566
REMEMBER THE HISTORY THE

24:22.633 --> 24:23.100
LEGISLATURE USED A PICK

24:23.166 --> 24:28.466
UNITED STATES SENATORS.

24:28.533 --> 24:28.866
OF COURSE THEY ARE

24:28.933 --> 24:29.500
ANTIDEMOCRATIC BUT THAT'S WHAT

24:29.566 --> 24:32.033
THEIR VOTERS WANT, 23% OF SELF

24:32.100 --> 24:35.300
IDENTIFIED REPUBLICANS AGREE

24:35.366 --> 24:37.966
WITH Q AND ON, THEY ARE MORE Q

24:38.033 --> 24:46.933
AND REPUBLICANS.

24:47.000 --> 24:57.966
>> Bill: YOU PRONOUNCE IT COUP

24:58.033 --> 24:58.400
ANON.

24:58.466 --> 24:59.600
[LAUGHTER]

24:59.666 --> 25:00.200
THERE ARE THINGS IN THE TABLE

25:00.266 --> 25:00.833
LIKE PACKING THE COURT, ADDING

25:00.900 --> 25:04.233
MORE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES,

25:04.300 --> 25:05.033
MAKING PUERTO RICO AND

25:05.100 --> 25:05.600
WASHINGTON, D.C., A STATE,

25:05.666 --> 25:10.500
ENDING THE FILIBUSTER, T THOSE E

25:10.566 --> 25:11.066
THE THREE BIG INSTITUTIONAL

25:11.133 --> 25:12.966
CHANGES THEY SAY WE SHOULD MAKE

25:13.033 --> 25:16.100
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND NOTHING

25:16.166 --> 25:18.066
CAN BE DONE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE

25:18.133 --> 25:20.700
WHO ARE SLOWLY TAKING OVER THE

25:20.766 --> 25:22.400
VOTING PROCESS, WHERE ARE YOU ON

25:22.466 --> 25:23.533
THESE THREE ISSUES, ARE THOSE

25:23.600 --> 25:25.700
THINGS SHOULD DO?

25:25.766 --> 25:29.800
NEW STATES, NO FILIBUSTER?

25:29.866 --> 25:33.233
>> I TEND TO THINK THAT BIDEN IS

25:33.300 --> 25:34.600
RIGHT TO FOCUS ON DELIVERING

25:34.666 --> 25:36.866
REAL THINGS THAT BRING ABOUT

25:36.933 --> 25:38.900
CHANGE AND LESS ON SOME OF THESE

25:38.966 --> 25:41.000
OTHER STEPS, I CERTAINLY WOULD

25:41.066 --> 25:41.933
LIKE TO SEE WASHINGTON, D.C.,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.500
BECOME A STATE, THAT MAKES SENSE

25:43.566 --> 25:44.200
TO ME BUT REALISTICALLY THAT'S

25:44.266 --> 25:46.800
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,

25:46.866 --> 25:47.466
SENATOR MANCHIN IS NOT GOING TO

25:47.533 --> 25:50.400
GO FOR THAT.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.600
I THINK WITH THE DEMOCRATS CAN

25:51.666 --> 25:53.633
DO AND I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN

25:53.700 --> 25:55.933
IS FOCUSING ON THIS IS MAKE

25:56.000 --> 25:57.800
IMPROVEMENTS, REAL IMPROVEMENTS

25:57.866 --> 25:59.233
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES THEY CAN

25:59.300 --> 26:00.500
DELIVER ON, PAST NATIONAL

26:00.566 --> 26:06.233
CHILD CARE, NATIONAL PRE-K,

26:06.300 --> 26:07.033
BANDWIDTH FOR ALL IN A COMMUNITY

26:07.100 --> 26:07.700
LIKE MY OWN IN RURAL OREGON,

26:07.766 --> 26:09.733
THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE

26:09.800 --> 26:12.300
DIFFERENCE.

26:12.366 --> 26:13.866
MY COMMUNITY IS REPUBLICAN BUT

26:13.933 --> 26:15.433
VOTED FOR FDR IN 1932.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.433
>> Bill: THEY SAY PEOPLE DON'T

26:16.500 --> 26:17.766
VOTE TO SAY THANK YOU, THEY VOTE

26:17.833 --> 26:21.800
TO SAY FUCK YOU.

26:21.866 --> 26:23.100
IF THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF

26:23.166 --> 26:25.200
THAT, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT

26:25.266 --> 26:27.733
THE DEMOCRATS DO DELIVER, THEY

26:27.800 --> 26:30.300
ARE DELIVERING NOW, THAT HAS

26:30.366 --> 26:33.566
BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES.

26:33.633 --> 26:34.166
MAYBE IT'S WHAT YOU SAID A

26:34.233 --> 26:36.433
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT GOT SO

26:36.500 --> 26:40.766
MANY HEADLINES, YOU SAID "

26:40.833 --> 26:41.533
"WOKENESS IS A PROBLEM AND

26:41.600 --> 26:43.966
EVERYONE KNOWS IT AND TALK ABOUT

26:44.033 --> 26:46.633
IT BEHIND THE SCENES."

26:46.700 --> 26:49.266
>> I GOT A GIFT FOR YOU, IT'S

26:49.333 --> 26:55.166
WRITTEN BY VLADIMIR LENIN, HE

26:55.233 --> 26:57.900
COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE WOKENESS

26:57.966 --> 26:59.866
IN ST. PETERSBURG A HUNDRED

26:59.933 --> 27:01.666
YEARS AGO, WHAT ARE YOU AND I

27:01.733 --> 27:06.133
GOING TO DO?

27:06.200 --> 27:06.700
WOULDN'T DO THAT WELL IN THE

27:06.766 --> 27:11.300
ELECTION, WE LOST HOUSE SEATS.

27:11.366 --> 27:15.166
WE CAME BACK IN GEORGIA BUT THE

27:15.233 --> 27:15.866
VICE PRESIDENT HAS TO VOTE TO

27:15.933 --> 27:18.700
BREAK A TIE.

27:18.766 --> 27:19.800
BIDEN CAME WITHIN 42,000 VOTES

27:19.866 --> 27:22.166
OF LOSING, HOW MUCH MORE DAMAGE

27:22.233 --> 27:24.466
CAN THESE PEOPLE DO TO THE PARTY

27:24.533 --> 27:25.100
BRAND BEFORE THEY FIGURE OUT TO

27:25.166 --> 27:27.866
DO THE THINGS THAT NICK IS

27:27.933 --> 27:28.433
TALKING ABOUT, TO DO THINGS

27:28.500 --> 27:31.033
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU'VE GOT

27:31.100 --> 27:31.866
TO POWER, IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU

27:31.933 --> 27:35.033
CAN DO IT AND TO ACQUIRE POWER

27:35.100 --> 27:36.433
YOU HAVE TO TALK THE LANGUAGE OF

27:36.500 --> 27:37.000
THE PEOPLE.

27:37.066 --> 27:39.600
WE HAVE TO START LEARNING THAT.

27:39.666 --> 27:41.666
THIS IS ALL PIE IN THE SKY

27:41.733 --> 27:42.133
STUFF.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.000
>> Bill: THE PEOPLE GET THEIR

27:44.066 --> 27:45.633
NEWS FROM NEWSFEEDS MOSTLY, THEY

27:45.700 --> 27:47.266
SEE IT ON FACEBOOK OR WHEN

27:47.333 --> 27:48.433
SOMEONE SENDS THEM SOMETHING OR

27:48.500 --> 27:50.133
TWITTER, THEY AREN'T READING

27:50.200 --> 27:50.733
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" I'M SORRY

27:50.800 --> 27:51.833
TO SAY, MOST OF THEM.

27:51.900 --> 27:55.200
>> NOT ENOUGH.

27:55.266 --> 27:58.033
>> Bill: NOT ENOUGH.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.366
AND WHAT THEY SEE THERE IS THIS

27:59.433 --> 28:03.600
DRIP DRIP DRIP EVERY DAY OF

28:03.666 --> 28:07.900
SOMETHING INSANE.

28:07.966 --> 28:11.000
NOT THAT QANON IS THE MOST

28:11.066 --> 28:12.400
INSANE COME OF COURSE IT IS,

28:12.466 --> 28:14.633
THAT WINS THE TROPHY.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.200
A FEW WEEKS AGO WE WERE DOING A

28:16.266 --> 28:17.633
BIT ABOUT MOVIES THAT HAVE TO

28:17.700 --> 28:18.533
HAVE DISCLAIMERS, WE MADE A JOKE

28:18.600 --> 28:20.933
ABOUT SNOW WHITE BECAUSE THE

28:21.000 --> 28:23.166
KISS IS NONCONSENSUAL.

28:23.233 --> 28:27.033
AND THEN THEY DID IT.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.000
LIKE THREE WEEKS LATER, IT

28:29.066 --> 28:30.866
BECAME REALITY, WE CAN'T HAVE

28:30.933 --> 28:34.333
SNOW WHITE KISS BECAUSE -- MY

28:34.400 --> 28:35.033
POINT IS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

28:35.100 --> 28:39.166
BECOME THE PARTY OF NO COMMON

28:39.233 --> 28:39.933
SENSE.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.400
YOU CAN'T WIN ELECTIONS.

28:43.466 --> 28:44.800
>> THAT IS 15% OF THE

28:44.866 --> 28:47.900
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

28:47.966 --> 28:50.833
>> Bill: BUT THEY HAVE THEIR

28:50.900 --> 28:55.533
REP, ANYTHING THAT IS "THE PARTY

28:55.600 --> 28:56.366
OF," EITHER GOES IN THE BLUE BIN

28:56.433 --> 29:00.300
OR THE RED IN.

29:00.366 --> 29:02.366
>> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS A LOT

29:02.433 --> 29:02.933
OF BLACKS, COLLEGE-EDUCATED

29:03.000 --> 29:04.533
WOMEN, LOOK TO THE FEDERAL

29:04.600 --> 29:10.033
GOVERNMENT TO DULL THE HARSHER

29:10.100 --> 29:12.666
EDGES OF CAPITALISM, IF YOU LOOK

29:12.733 --> 29:13.233
AT -- THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS

29:13.300 --> 29:15.866
TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN THE

29:15.933 --> 29:20.033
PRACTICAL OF JOE BIDEN AND

29:20.100 --> 29:21.233
EVERYONE ON THE LEFT,

29:21.300 --> 29:21.966
SENATOR WARREN, SENATOR SANDERS,

29:22.033 --> 29:27.266
IT WASN'T CLOSE.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.933
15% OF OUR PARTY DISRESPECTS

29:30.000 --> 29:33.100
DEMOCRATS WHO GO OUT AND VOTE IN

29:33.166 --> 29:36.366
PRIMARIES, MAKE A CHOICE, MAKE A

29:36.433 --> 29:38.233
SELECTION.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.666
UNTIL WE ALL LEARNED THAT AND

29:40.733 --> 29:43.600
NOT LET THE URBAN EDUCATED CORE

29:43.666 --> 29:44.600
DEFINE US TO EVERYBODY ELSE IN

29:44.666 --> 29:45.733
THE COUNTRY, WE ARE GOING TO

29:45.800 --> 29:49.566
CONTINUE TO HAVE DISAPPOINTING

29:49.633 --> 29:50.966
NIGHTS LIKE WE HAD A NOVEMBER.

29:51.033 --> 29:53.833
>> Bill: I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S

29:53.900 --> 29:54.466
BECAUSE PEOPLE -- I WAS READING

29:54.533 --> 29:57.000
ABOUT LOCKHEED MARTIN.

29:57.066 --> 29:58.733
THEY ARE ONE OF THE COMPANIES,

29:58.800 --> 29:59.733
THIS IS GOING ON ALL OF THE

29:59.800 --> 30:02.633
COUNTRY NOW, THAT HAVE -- I

30:02.700 --> 30:03.833
WOULD SAY THEY ARE FORCED TO

30:03.900 --> 30:06.800
HAVE THIS KIND OF DIVERSITY

30:06.866 --> 30:07.066
TRAINING.

30:07.133 --> 30:07.800
IT'S A THREE DAY CAMP, PEOPLE

30:07.866 --> 30:11.800
WERE WRITING ABOUT IT.

30:11.866 --> 30:13.133
WHAT'S IN IT?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.300
MARGINALIZED GROUPS ARE FREED

30:15.366 --> 30:16.066
FROM THE EXHAUSTING WORK

30:16.133 --> 30:18.833
COACHING WHITE MEN TO UNDERSTAND

30:18.900 --> 30:19.133
THEIR WORLD.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.400
I'M SURE THAT A SORT OF A

30:20.466 --> 30:21.900
PROBLEM SOMETIMES, PEOPLE WHO

30:21.966 --> 30:22.566
DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR WORLD, BUT

30:22.633 --> 30:25.333
I THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING ALONG

30:25.400 --> 30:26.866
ENOUGH TO TALK TO EACH OTHER IN

30:26.933 --> 30:28.833
THE WORKPLACE.

30:28.900 --> 30:31.900
SO THESE COMPANIES -- THIS IS A

30:31.966 --> 30:33.533
COTTAGE INDUSTRY NOW.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.600
TO HIRE SOMEONE TO YELL AT THE

30:35.666 --> 30:39.066
WHITE PEOPLE.

30:39.133 --> 30:40.300
>> IT'S A REFLECTION OF A

30:40.366 --> 30:42.133
REALITY THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN

30:42.200 --> 30:44.633
AMOUNT OF MYOPIA ABOUT RACIAL

30:44.700 --> 30:45.533
ISSUES AND AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS

30:45.600 --> 30:46.933
A PANEL OF THREE WHITE GUYS

30:47.000 --> 30:49.766
TALKING ABOUT RACE.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.566
[APPLAUSE]

30:53.633 --> 30:55.233
>> Bill: SO THREE WHITE PEOPLE

30:55.300 --> 30:56.300
CAN'T TALK ABOUT RACE, YOU DON'T

30:56.366 --> 30:59.133
DO THAT IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE,

30:59.200 --> 31:01.200
THREE WHITE PEOPLE -- IT'S SO

31:01.266 --> 31:02.400
SILLY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO

31:02.466 --> 31:03.300
HAVE A BENETTON AD EVERY TIME I

31:03.366 --> 31:05.366
HAVE A SHOW.

31:05.433 --> 31:08.000
I ONLY HAVE TWO CHAIRS, YOU GUYS

31:08.066 --> 31:10.266
WERE AVAILABLE THIS WEEK, YOU'RE

31:10.333 --> 31:12.000
SMART, THERE'S NO CRIME IN THIS.

31:12.066 --> 31:13.200
IT WOULD BE A CRIME IF I NEVER

31:13.266 --> 31:17.800
HAD A BLACK PERSON ON.

31:17.866 --> 31:20.033
>> I DO THINK DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

31:20.100 --> 31:22.600
DIVERSITY BENEFIT FROM DIVERSE

31:22.666 --> 31:23.033
VOICES.

31:23.100 --> 31:23.466
>> Bill: YES.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.700
>> I THINK IS AWFUL LOT OF

31:25.766 --> 31:28.233
WHITES, POLLS SHOW 50% OF WHITES

31:28.300 --> 31:30.666
IN AMERICA DON'T BELIEVE BLACKS

31:30.733 --> 31:31.200
FACED SERIOUS IMPEDIMENTS.

31:31.266 --> 31:32.833
THERE WAS A GOOD HARVARD STUDY

31:32.900 --> 31:35.000
SHOWING THEY SENT OUT 1500

31:35.066 --> 31:36.000
APPLICATIONS WITH SOME BLACK

31:36.066 --> 31:40.700
NAMES, SOME WHITE NAMES TO JOB

31:40.766 --> 31:44.033
ADS, A WHITE NAME WAS EQUIVALENT

31:44.100 --> 31:46.233
TO EIGHT MORE YEARS OF JOB

31:46.300 --> 31:47.100
EXPERIENCE.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.300
I'M NOT DEFENDING THIS

31:48.366 --> 31:51.800
JOB TRAINING, I DO THINK THERE

31:51.866 --> 31:52.100
IS A REAL --

31:52.166 --> 31:54.100
>> Bill: I'M NOT EVEN ARGUING

31:54.166 --> 31:55.400
THAT, I'M SAYING IS THIS THE

31:55.466 --> 31:56.933
METHOD TO DO IT, TO HAVE THESE

31:57.000 --> 32:00.266
OUTSIDERS COME IN AND TAKE YOU

32:00.333 --> 32:00.933
SOMEWHERE.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.833
I THINK THEY HAVE STUDIED IT'S,

32:02.900 --> 32:05.566
THEY FOUND OUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

32:05.633 --> 32:09.233
PEOPLE RESENT IT.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.000
>> I THINK I COULD BENEFITS, I'M

32:12.066 --> 32:13.000
SURE THERE ARE THINGS IN MY

32:13.066 --> 32:15.300
EVERYDAY LIFE THAT I COULD DO

32:15.366 --> 32:16.000
BETTER.

32:16.066 --> 32:20.700
BUT YOU START OUT AND YOU SAY

32:20.766 --> 32:24.500
ALL RIGHT, YOU SORRY WHITE SACK

32:24.566 --> 32:26.100
OF RACIST SHIT -- THERE ARE WAYS

32:26.166 --> 32:27.866
THAT YOU COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE

32:27.933 --> 32:33.766
THAT YOU DON'T REALIZE, I'M ALL

32:33.833 --> 32:35.900
EARS.

32:35.966 --> 32:39.333
BY THE WAY, THIS GUY ERIC

32:39.400 --> 32:41.166
HAWTHORNE WHO SAID EVERY

32:41.233 --> 32:43.900
MOVEMENT STARTS OUT AS A CAUSE,

32:43.966 --> 32:46.533
MORPHS INTO A BUSINESS AND

32:46.600 --> 32:47.200
MORPHS INTO A RACKET.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.833
>> Bill: IT IS A WOKE

32:48.900 --> 32:49.466
PROTECTION RACKETS BECAUSE YOU

32:49.533 --> 32:52.200
CAN'T SAY NO TO IT BECAUSE THEN

32:52.266 --> 32:53.333
YOU'RE RACIST TO BEGIN WITH AND

32:53.400 --> 32:57.333
WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND OUT IS WHAT

32:57.400 --> 32:57.700
WORKS BETTER, SO

32:57.766 --> 33:01.366
COMMONSENSICAL -- SIDE-BY-SIDE,

33:01.433 --> 33:02.166
PEOPLE WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE

33:02.233 --> 33:03.933
WHICH I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING

33:04.000 --> 33:05.333
AND MOVING TOWARD WHEN PEOPLE

33:05.400 --> 33:07.333
ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.733
AND CAN JOKE WITH EACH OTHER,

33:09.800 --> 33:13.033
JOKING AS A BONDING EXPERIENCE.

33:13.100 --> 33:16.433
NO ONE WOULD MAKE A JOKE.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.200
[APPLAUSE]

33:18.266 --> 33:20.533
>> I DO THINK JAMES WAS RIGHT

33:20.600 --> 33:22.733
EARLIER AND MAKING THE POINT

33:22.800 --> 33:23.400
THAT THIS IS AN EXTREME WING OF

33:23.466 --> 33:25.766
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT CAUSES

33:25.833 --> 33:26.533
THESE.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.200
I DON'T THINK WHAT LOCKHEED DID

33:29.266 --> 33:30.733
IS TRULY THE MOST IMPORTANT

33:30.800 --> 33:32.833
ISSUE FACING THE COUNTRY.

33:32.900 --> 33:36.133
YET WE AMPLIFY IT WITH OUR

33:36.200 --> 33:36.466
DISCUSSION.

33:36.533 --> 33:39.433
>> Bill: IT'S NOT, BUT THEY

33:39.500 --> 33:40.966
AREN'T THE ONLY COMPANY DOING

33:41.033 --> 33:41.833
IT, IT'S GOING ON ALL OVER AND

33:41.900 --> 33:44.633
WHAT I'M ASKING IS I THINK THIS

33:44.700 --> 33:46.933
IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THE

33:47.000 --> 33:47.700
DEMOCRATS.

33:47.766 --> 33:49.800
NOBODY WHO IS IN A THREE DAY

33:49.866 --> 33:51.966
CAMP AND RESENTS IT IS GOING TO

33:52.033 --> 33:53.166
BLAME THE REPUBLICANS FOR THIS,

33:53.233 --> 33:53.933
THEY ARE GOING TO BLAME THE

33:54.000 --> 33:54.966
DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE GOING TO

33:55.033 --> 33:57.800
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:57.866 --> 33:59.233
I THINK I CAN HANDLE THIS ON MY

33:59.300 --> 34:00.766
OWN, THERE ARE RACISTS OUT THERE

34:00.833 --> 34:02.166
IN THIS COUNTRY, OF COURSE THERE

34:02.233 --> 34:05.000
IS RACISM IN THE SYSTEM FROM THE

34:05.066 --> 34:06.666
BEGINNING THAT NEEDS TO BE

34:06.733 --> 34:09.200
ROOTED OUT.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.266
ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THERE ARE

34:11.333 --> 34:13.000
PEOPLE GOING I GET IT, I'M NOT

34:13.066 --> 34:13.766
AN IDIOT, I HAVE LOOKED AT MY

34:13.833 --> 34:15.833
SOUL, I KNOW WHO I AM, I DON'T

34:15.900 --> 34:17.333
THINK I'M REALLY A PART OF THIS

34:17.400 --> 34:18.000
PROBLEM I KNOW YOU'RE YELLING AT

34:18.066 --> 34:20.200
ME FOR THREE DAYS FOR SOMETHING

34:20.266 --> 34:21.066
I THOUGHT I WAS TAKING CARE OF

34:21.133 --> 34:24.000
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL BY BEING A

34:24.066 --> 34:29.733
DECENT PERSON TO EVERYBODY.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.566
[APPLAUSE]

34:32.633 --> 34:36.200
>> I THINK SOME OF THIS, MY GOOD

34:36.266 --> 34:37.466
FRIEND IS THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR

34:37.533 --> 34:38.966
AT LSU, THEY DO A LOT OF THIS

34:39.033 --> 34:39.533
BUT THEY START TO DO SURVEYS

34:39.600 --> 34:40.800
THEY FOUND OUT HOW PEOPLE FEEL

34:40.866 --> 34:43.566
IN THE WORKPLACE, I THINK YOU

34:43.633 --> 34:43.833
NEED THAT.

34:43.900 --> 34:47.200
I THINK A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE

34:47.266 --> 34:48.800
DON'T LIVE MULTICULTURAL, THEY

34:48.866 --> 34:49.500
LIVE ISOLATED AND I THINK SOME

34:49.566 --> 34:51.800
OF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

34:51.866 --> 34:53.766
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO THAT

34:53.833 --> 34:56.066
YOU CAN'T TAKE TOO FAR AND

34:56.133 --> 34:57.000
APPARENTLY LOCKHEED BOUGHT INTO

34:57.066 --> 34:58.933
SOME SYSTEM FROM SOMEBODY THAT

34:59.000 --> 35:00.733
WAS JUST IDIOTIC.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.133
>> Bill: IF I CAN CHANGE

35:03.200 --> 35:05.000
TOPICS HERE, VEGAS IS COMING

35:05.066 --> 35:08.800

35:09.833 --> 35:10.033
[APPLAUSE]

35:10.100 --> 35:13.500
I WANT TO SAY LAS VEGAS TO ME IS

35:13.566 --> 35:16.666
AMERICA, YES VEGAS IS TACKY BUT

35:16.733 --> 35:20.133
AMERICA IS TACKY AND THEY HAVE

35:20.200 --> 35:21.900
ASKED ME, THE CITY OF LAS VEGAS

35:21.966 --> 35:26.566

35:26.633 --> 35:27.800

35:29.600 --> 35:30.466

35:33.766 --> 35:34.866

35:38.700 --> 35:41.933
THE KIDS.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.200
[LAUGHTER]

35:42.266 --> 35:44.366
[APPLAUSE]

35:44.433 --> 35:44.633
LAS VEGAS!

35:44.700 --> 35:46.000

35:46.066 --> 35:49.500

35:49.566 --> 35:49.766
[LAUGHTER]

35:49.833 --> 35:50.766
[APPLAUSE]

35:50.833 --> 35:51.666
COME TO LAS VEGAS.

35:51.733 --> 35:52.466
THAT STIMULUS MONEY ISN'T GOING

35:52.533 --> 35:55.166
TO SPEND ITSELF.

35:55.233 --> 35:55.433
[LAUGHTER]

35:55.500 --> 35:56.766
[APPLAUSE]

35:56.833 --> 35:57.966
NOW THAT YOU'RE IMMUNE, TRY THE

35:58.033 --> 36:03.000
BUFFET.

36:03.066 --> 36:03.266
[LAUGHTER]

36:03.333 --> 36:06.100
[APPLAUSE]

36:06.166 --> 36:07.466
WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN

36:07.533 --> 36:07.666
VEGAS.

36:07.733 --> 36:13.100
UNLIKE WUHAN.

36:13.166 --> 36:13.366
[LAUGHTER]

36:13.433 --> 36:16.266
[APPLAUSE]

36:16.333 --> 36:17.633
WHERE THE GIRLS WILL DO THAT

36:17.700 --> 36:22.833
THING YOUR WIFE THINKS IS GROSS.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.100
[LAUGHTER]

36:23.166 --> 36:24.333
[APPLAUSE]

36:24.400 --> 36:25.500
SEE BILL MAHER LIVE, JULY 17TH

36:25.566 --> 36:31.966
AT THE MIRAGE.

36:32.033 --> 36:34.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

36:34.900 --> 36:38.600
HOW DID...

36:38.666 --> 36:39.066
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

36:39.133 --> 36:42.400
HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE?

36:42.466 --> 36:44.700
IT'S TRUE, I'LL BE THERE

36:44.766 --> 36:44.966
JULY 17TH.

36:45.033 --> 36:47.466
REPUBLICANS: KIDS EAT FREE!

36:47.533 --> 36:56.233
DEMOCRATS: EAT KIDS FREE!

36:56.300 --> 36:56.500
[LAUGHTER]

36:56.566 --> 36:58.633
[APPLAUSE]

36:58.700 --> 37:00.333
I KNEW YOU WOULD GET THAT.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.666
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL BADLY FOR

37:02.733 --> 37:06.633
BRITNEY SPEARS IN PERSON.

37:06.700 --> 37:06.900
[LAUGHTER]

37:06.966 --> 37:08.833
[APPLAUSE]

37:08.900 --> 37:11.433
AND VEGAS!

37:11.500 --> 37:12.466
WHERE UBER-WOKE PEOPLE CAN GO

37:12.533 --> 37:19.266
FUCK THEMSELVES.

37:19.333 --> 37:23.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

37:23.900 --> 37:24.833
ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS I HAD

37:24.900 --> 37:25.866
WHILE I WAS OFF AS I WAS

37:25.933 --> 37:27.466
WATCHING THIS WAR GO ON IN

37:27.533 --> 37:28.633
ISRAEL, ISRAEL IS THE CHAMPION

37:28.700 --> 37:30.633
OF HAVING VERY QUICK WARS, THIS

37:30.700 --> 37:31.633
ONE WAS 11 DAYS BUT MOST OF THEM

37:31.700 --> 37:33.366
YOU CAN COUNT BY DAYS, EVEN ONES

37:33.433 --> 37:35.733
WHERE THEY WERE FACING WHOLE

37:35.800 --> 37:36.100
ARMIES.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.566
IT WAS FRUSTRATING TO ME BECAUSE

37:38.633 --> 37:39.800
THERE WAS NO ONE ON LIBERAL

37:39.866 --> 37:42.533
MEDIA TO DEFEND ISRAEL, REALLY,

37:42.600 --> 37:43.500
WE BECOME THIS COUNTRY NOW WHERE

37:43.566 --> 37:45.300
WE ARE ONE SIDED ON THIS ISSUE.

37:45.366 --> 37:47.133
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY OFF THE

37:47.200 --> 37:48.466
BAT THAT I DON'T THINK KIDS

37:48.533 --> 37:51.566
UNDERSTAND -- WHEN I SAY KIDS, I

37:51.633 --> 37:52.166
SAY THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS --

37:52.233 --> 37:56.833
YOU CAN'T LEARN HISTORY OF

37:56.900 --> 37:58.766
INSTAGRAM.

37:58.833 --> 37:59.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

37:59.466 --> 38:04.233
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SPACE.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.833
SO I WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF THE

38:05.900 --> 38:07.833
HISTORY BUT FIRST I READ YOUR

38:07.900 --> 38:09.766
COLUMN ON IT, EVENHANDED AND

38:09.833 --> 38:10.200
BRILLIANT AS USUAL.

38:10.266 --> 38:12.400
LET ME QUOTE YOU OFF THE BAT.

38:12.466 --> 38:15.333
YOU SAY AT HOME, ISRAEL HAS A

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
ROBUST DEMOCRACY THAT GIVES MORE

38:16.466 --> 38:17.500
RIGHTS TO ARAB CITIZENS AND ITS

38:17.566 --> 38:20.033
NEIGHBORS DO.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.466
[APPLAUSE]

38:24.533 --> 38:27.200
THIS WAS AFTER ALL A WAR WITH

38:27.266 --> 38:27.400
GAZA.

38:27.466 --> 38:30.633
THANK GOD ISRAEL TREATS ITS ARAB

38:30.700 --> 38:32.566
CITIZENS BETTER THAN EGYPT,

38:32.633 --> 38:34.000
SYRIA, OR SAUDI ARABIA TREAT

38:34.066 --> 38:34.800
THEIR ARAB CITIZENS COME I

38:34.866 --> 38:35.633
DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF THAT IN THE

38:35.700 --> 38:37.800
PRESS, I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU SAY

38:37.866 --> 38:39.466
IT, CAN YOU PUT SOME BONES ON

38:39.533 --> 38:41.600
THAT, WHY DO YOU SAY THEY TREAT

38:41.666 --> 38:42.166
THEIR CITIZENS BETTER, THEIR

38:42.233 --> 38:46.500
ARAB CITIZENS?

38:46.566 --> 38:47.966
>> I ALSO SAID A LOT MORE AND

38:48.033 --> 38:53.833
CLEARLY WITHIN ISRAEL, ARAB

38:53.900 --> 38:54.433
CITIZENS OBVIOUSLY VOTE, THEY

38:54.500 --> 38:57.866
CAN SERVE IN THE KNESSET, THEY

38:57.933 --> 39:00.766
CAN BE JUDGES, SOME OF THE MOST

39:00.833 --> 39:02.433
ROBUST ORGANIZATIONS SPEAKING

39:02.500 --> 39:04.000
UPPER PALESTINIANS ARE

39:04.066 --> 39:04.600
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE HUMAN

39:04.666 --> 39:08.033
RIGHTS ORGANIZATION -- THAT DOES

39:08.100 --> 39:11.033
NOT HAPPEN IN EGYPT, OBVIOUSLY

39:11.100 --> 39:14.300
MASSACRES EGYPTIANS, WE'VE SEEN

39:14.366 --> 39:15.900
IT HAPPEN IN SYRIA.

39:15.966 --> 39:18.366
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I MADE

39:18.433 --> 39:19.000
THAT POINT FOR CONTEXT, I THINK

39:19.066 --> 39:21.533
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

39:21.600 --> 39:24.466
THAT ISRAEL AT HOME TRULY IS

39:24.533 --> 39:25.866
ROBUST.

39:25.933 --> 39:26.700
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS A

39:26.766 --> 39:31.466
DEFENSE FOR ISRAEL ENGAGING AND

39:31.533 --> 39:36.633
POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES IN GAZA.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.533
>> Bill: GAZA FIRED 4,000

39:37.600 --> 39:39.966
ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL, WHAT WOULD

39:40.033 --> 39:41.100
YOU SAY ISRAEL SHOULD HAVE DONE

39:41.166 --> 39:47.133
INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DID?

39:47.200 --> 39:47.833
>> INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS ARE

39:47.900 --> 39:49.766
PRETTY CLEAR THEY HAVE A RIGHT

39:49.833 --> 39:50.933
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES, THEY HAVE

39:51.000 --> 39:51.933
A RIGHT TO RESPOND AT MILITARY

39:52.000 --> 39:54.433
TARGETS BUT THERE IS A SENSE

39:54.500 --> 39:55.966
THAT THE RESPONSE WAS PROBABLY A

39:56.033 --> 39:57.866
WAR CRIME BECAUSE IT DID NOT

39:57.933 --> 39:59.766
SUFFICIENTLY AVOID CIVILIAN

39:59.833 --> 40:01.100
CASUALTIES.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.700
>> Bill: BUT THEY PURPOSELY

40:02.766 --> 40:07.266
PUT THE ROCKETS IN CIVILIAN

40:07.333 --> 40:07.966
PLACES.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.033
>> LIKEWISE ISRAEL'S DEFENSE

40:09.100 --> 40:10.766
MINISTRY IS A CIVILIAN AREA,

40:10.833 --> 40:12.633
BOTH SIDES DO THIS.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.866
I THINK HAMAS PARTICULARLY

40:13.933 --> 40:16.266
DOESN'T AND IT'S A WAR CRIME ON

40:16.333 --> 40:18.000
PART OF HAMAS AND CLEARLY HAMAS

40:18.066 --> 40:18.766
IS ENGAGING IN WAR CRIMES.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.833
>> Bill: WAR IS A CRIME, IT

40:20.900 --> 40:21.866
SEEMS LIKE A SILLY ARGUMENT WHEN

40:21.933 --> 40:25.200
PEOPLE GO TO WAR, THERE ARE

40:25.266 --> 40:26.100
CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND

40:26.166 --> 40:27.400
THE PALE BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE IT

40:27.466 --> 40:28.766
WAS A NORMAL WAR, PEOPLE DIE IN

40:28.833 --> 40:31.866
WAR, IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.

40:31.933 --> 40:37.433
>> WE HAVE DEVELOPED LAWS OF WAR

40:37.500 --> 40:39.833
PRECISELY TO RESTRAIN INHUMANITY

40:39.900 --> 40:41.566
OF WAR, WE DON'T ALLOW CHEMICAL

40:41.633 --> 40:41.800
WEAPONS.

40:41.866 --> 40:43.266
A SPOON I DON'T KNOW I WAS TO

40:43.333 --> 40:47.933
RESPOND -- WHAT IF CANADA FIRED

40:48.000 --> 40:50.166
4,000 ROCKETS INTO AMERICA OR

40:50.233 --> 40:52.366
MEXICO WHICH IS AN EVEN BETTER

40:52.433 --> 40:53.533
ANALOGY BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DID

40:53.600 --> 40:56.366
STEAL THE LAND FROM MEXICO -- I

40:56.433 --> 40:57.900
WOULD SUBMIT THAT ISRAEL DID NOT

40:57.966 --> 40:59.300
STEAL ANYBODY'S LAND, THIS IS

40:59.366 --> 41:00.400
ANOTHER THING I'VE HEARD OF THE

41:00.466 --> 41:05.733
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, WORDS LIKE

41:05.800 --> 41:07.766
"OCCUPIERS" AND "COLONIZERS" AND

41:07.833 --> 41:08.333
APARTHEID COME I DON'T THINK

41:08.400 --> 41:09.900
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY

41:10.000 --> 41:11.800
THERE.

41:11.866 --> 41:13.000
THE JEWS HAVE BEEN IN THAT AREA

41:13.066 --> 41:15.933
OF THE WORLD SINCE ABOUT 1200

41:16.000 --> 41:20.066
BC, WAY BEFORE THE FIRST MUSLIM

41:20.133 --> 41:23.933
OR ARAB WALKED THE EARTH, A

41:24.000 --> 41:25.900
THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE.

41:25.966 --> 41:27.600
JERUSALEM WAS THEIR CAPITAL.

41:27.666 --> 41:29.166
IF IT'S JUST ABOUT WHO GOT THERE

41:29.233 --> 41:31.466
FIRST, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

41:31.533 --> 41:32.200
THERE HAVE BEEN A CONTINUOUS

41:32.266 --> 41:35.700
JEWISH PRESENCE -- THE JEWS WERE

41:35.766 --> 41:37.566
THE ONES WHO WERE OCCUPIED BY

41:37.633 --> 41:38.200
EVERYBODY, THE ROMANS TOOK OVER

41:38.266 --> 41:42.033
AT SOME POINT AND THE PERSIANS

41:42.100 --> 41:46.166
IN THE BYZANTINES AND THE

41:46.233 --> 41:46.666
OTTOMANS, YES, THERE WAS

41:46.733 --> 41:49.766
COLONIZATION GOING ON THERE

41:49.833 --> 41:50.366
COMMIT BEGINNING IN THE 19TH

41:50.433 --> 41:52.133
CENTURY, THEY STARTED TO RETURN

41:52.200 --> 41:56.100
TO PALESTINE, WHICH WAS NEVER AN

41:56.166 --> 41:58.733
ARAB COUNTRY, IT WAS NEVER A

41:58.800 --> 41:59.333
COUNTRY CALLED PALESTINE THAT

41:59.400 --> 42:03.900
WAS A DISTINCT ARAB COUNTRY.

42:03.966 --> 42:05.166
YES, THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE

42:05.233 --> 42:06.300
BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE

42:06.366 --> 42:07.100
WHO WANTED TO SHARE THE LAND

42:07.166 --> 42:11.466
WHICH IS WHY THE U.N. IN 1947

42:11.533 --> 42:13.133
SAID OKAY, WE ARE GOING TO IT.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.800
WE HAVE THE MAP, PEOPLE FORGET

42:15.866 --> 42:18.200
WITH THE MAP LOOKED LIKE.

42:18.266 --> 42:19.466
THIS IS WHAT WAS ON THE TABLE AT

42:19.533 --> 42:22.700
THE BEGINNING, THE GREEN IS THE

42:22.766 --> 42:23.666
PART THAT THE ARAB POPULATION

42:23.733 --> 42:26.200
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN.

42:26.266 --> 42:28.000
IT'S A GOOD PART OF THE COUNTRY,

42:28.066 --> 42:29.466
IT'S THE GOOD PART A LOT OF IT,

42:29.533 --> 42:31.466
LOOK WHAT ISRAEL HAS COME A

42:31.533 --> 42:32.066
LITTLE SLIVER BY THE COAST IN

42:32.133 --> 42:33.566
THE DESERT IN THE SOUTH FOR THAT

42:33.633 --> 42:36.100
SECOND MAP IS WHAT ISRAEL HAS

42:36.166 --> 42:36.300
TODAY.

42:36.366 --> 42:38.766
YES, IT IS A LOT MORE, BUT

42:38.833 --> 42:42.433
DOESN'T IT BEHOOVE THE PEOPLE

42:42.500 --> 42:46.266
WHO REJECTED THE HALF A LOAF AND

42:46.333 --> 42:50.233
THEN CONTINUE ATTACK -- HAMAS'

42:50.300 --> 42:52.233
CHARTER SAYS THEY JUST WANT TO

42:52.300 --> 42:53.233
WIPE OUT ISRAEL, THEIR

42:53.300 --> 42:55.833
NEGOTIATING POSITION IS YOU ALL

42:55.900 --> 42:56.100
DIE.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.566
[APPLAUSE]

42:58.633 --> 43:00.766
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

43:00.833 --> 43:01.933
DEFENDING HAMAS WHICH I AGREE

43:02.000 --> 43:03.466
COMMITS WAR CRIMES AND I WOULD

43:03.533 --> 43:06.933
ACCEPT THAT I THINK TOO OFTEN IN

43:07.000 --> 43:09.166
LIBERAL CIRCLES THERE HAS BEEN A

43:09.233 --> 43:11.866
TENDENCY TO ELIDE THE REPRESSION

43:11.933 --> 43:15.366
OF HAMAS, THE HOMOPHOBIA OF

43:15.433 --> 43:16.033
HAMAS, THE MISOGYNY OF HAMAS BUT

43:16.100 --> 43:19.633
THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE ISRAEL

43:19.700 --> 43:21.466
RULING PALESTINIANS IN THE

43:21.533 --> 43:22.466
WEST BANK FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT

43:22.533 --> 43:25.366
GIVING THEM -- TAKING WATER AND

43:25.433 --> 43:27.766
GIVING IT THE SETTLERS AND MAYBE

43:27.833 --> 43:31.133
MOST IMPORTANT, DAMAGING ANY

43:31.200 --> 43:32.166
POSSIBILITY DOWN THE ROAD OF

43:32.233 --> 43:35.200
CREATING A TWO STATE SOLUTION.

43:35.266 --> 43:37.366
HOW DO WE AVOID A WAR WHEN

43:37.433 --> 43:39.900
SOMEBODY IS -- SOMEONE YOUR

43:39.966 --> 43:41.933
NEIGHBOR IS SHELLING, THAT IS

43:42.000 --> 43:42.133
HARD.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.266
WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY TO CREATE

43:44.333 --> 43:45.266
82 STATE SOLUTION TEN YEARS FROM

43:45.333 --> 43:46.766
NOW ON THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS

43:46.833 --> 43:47.666
YOU DON'T BUILD UP SETTLEMENTS

43:47.733 --> 43:49.033
RIGHT NOW IN THE WEST BANK AND

43:49.100 --> 43:53.333
YOU DON'T CREATE THIS DIVISION,

43:53.400 --> 43:54.500
YOU DON'T SEIZE THEIR HOMES.

43:54.566 --> 43:55.733
>> Bill: I WOULD AGREE WITH

43:55.800 --> 43:56.466
THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF

43:56.533 --> 43:58.333
ISRAELIS DO TOO.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.233
>> NOT ENOUGH TO ELECT --

44:01.300 --> 44:04.100
>> Bill: AGAIN, THE TWO STATE

44:04.166 --> 44:06.066
SOLUTION HAS BEEN ON THE TABLE A

44:06.133 --> 44:08.600
NUMBER OF TIMES, THERE COULD BE

44:08.666 --> 44:09.900
AN ARAB CAPITAL IN EAST

44:09.966 --> 44:13.066
JERUSALEM NOW IF YASSER ARAFAT

44:13.133 --> 44:15.366
HAD ACCEPTED THAT IN 2003, HE

44:15.433 --> 44:16.966
DID NOT.

44:17.033 --> 44:18.300
THEY HAVE REJECTED THIS AND WENT

44:18.366 --> 44:22.466
TO WAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

44:22.533 --> 44:25.566
AS FAR AS GAZA GOES, IT'S

44:25.633 --> 44:27.666
AMAZING TO ME THAT THE

44:27.733 --> 44:30.200
PROGRESSIVES THINK THAT THEY ARE

44:30.266 --> 44:31.100
BEING PROGRESSIVE BY TAKING THAT

44:31.166 --> 44:40.600
SIDE OF IT, THE BELLA HADIDS OF

44:40.666 --> 44:40.933
THE WORLD.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.700
IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, A

44:43.766 --> 44:46.333
HAMAS COURT RULED AN UNMARRIED

44:46.400 --> 44:49.233
WOMAN CANNOT TRAVEL IN GAZA

44:49.300 --> 44:51.266
WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE

44:51.333 --> 44:51.933
MALE GUARDIAN, THAT IS WHERE THE

44:52.000 --> 44:55.100
PROGRESSIVES ARE?

44:55.166 --> 44:56.200
BELLA HADID AND HER FRIENDS

44:56.266 --> 44:58.666
WOULD RUN SCREAMING TO TEL AVIV

44:58.733 --> 44:59.900
IF THEY HAD TO LIVE IN GAZA FOR

44:59.966 --> 45:03.533
ONE DAY.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.966
>> I'VE BEEN TO GAZA AND A

45:06.033 --> 45:07.200
NUMBER OF TIMES AND ORDINARY

45:07.266 --> 45:08.333
GAZANS COMPLAIN ABOUT HAMAS ALL

45:08.400 --> 45:11.766
THE TIME, I DID NOT PERCEIVE

45:11.833 --> 45:12.533
BELLA HADID AS DEFENDING HAMAS,

45:12.600 --> 45:13.833
I SAW HER AS SPEAKING UP FOR THE

45:13.900 --> 45:16.600
KIDS IN GAZA WHO WERE KILLED.

45:16.666 --> 45:17.900
>> Bill: FROM THE RIVER TO THE

45:17.966 --> 45:20.400
SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE IS

45:20.466 --> 45:21.266
WHAT I THINK SHE CHANTED WITH

45:21.333 --> 45:25.433
PEOPLE, THAT IS A PLO SLOGAN

45:25.500 --> 45:26.266
THAT MEANS ISRAEL FROM THE RIVER

45:26.333 --> 45:28.033
TO THE SEA, THERE WILL BE NO

45:28.100 --> 45:30.766
MORE ISRAEL.

45:30.833 --> 45:32.966
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT

45:33.033 --> 45:33.700
THIS?

45:33.766 --> 45:35.500
>> I WAS KIND OF GLAD TO LISTEN,

45:35.566 --> 45:38.800
I DON'T WANT TO STEP ON A

45:38.866 --> 45:43.833
LAND MINE.

45:43.900 --> 45:44.100
[LAUGHTER]

45:44.166 --> 45:44.600
[APPLAUSE]

45:44.666 --> 45:46.400
TO BUTTRESS NEXT POINT A LITTLE

45:46.466 --> 45:47.800
BIT, THEY WERE ABOUT TO FORM A

45:47.866 --> 45:49.466
GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDED THE

45:49.533 --> 45:50.366
ARAB PARTY.

45:50.433 --> 45:51.266
ONCE YOU'RE PART OF THE

45:51.333 --> 45:53.766
GOVERNMENT, IT MEANS YOU HAVE

45:53.833 --> 45:54.800
THREE VOTES IN THE KNESSET TO

45:54.866 --> 45:56.466
GET THE 6161.

45:56.533 --> 45:57.033
>> Bill: NO APARTHEID STATE

45:57.100 --> 45:59.333
EVER DID.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.933
AND APARTHEID WE THINK OF AS

46:01.000 --> 46:01.600
SOUTH AFRICA WHICH IS THE WHITE

46:01.666 --> 46:06.100
PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND HOLLAND

46:06.166 --> 46:07.500
WHO NEVER HAD ANY CLAIM TO THE

46:07.566 --> 46:09.466
LAND OR ANY HISTORY THERE CAME

46:09.533 --> 46:10.066
THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER AND

46:10.133 --> 46:11.400
JUST TOOK IT OVER.

46:11.466 --> 46:14.333
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.100
THEN THEY KEPT IT AS AN

46:16.166 --> 48:54.166
APARTHEID

48:54.233 --> 48:55.166
BREAK IT TO THE TONYS THAT THEY

48:55.233 --> 48:55.700
NEED MORE STRAIGHT PEOPLE?

48:55.766 --> 48:56.266
NEW RULE: THE PARENTS OF THE

48:56.333 --> 48:57.400
11-YEAR OLD GIRL WHO SAID SHE

48:57.466 --> 48:58.233
WAS ABLE TO FOIL A KIDNAPPER

48:58.300 --> 48:59.666
BECAUSE SHE'S A DEVOTED VIEWER

48:59.733 --> 49:00.400
OF LAW AND ORDER: SVU HAVE SOME

49:00.466 --> 49:01.466
EXPLAINING TO DO.

49:01.533 --> 49:02.500
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN LAW AND

49:02.566 --> 49:05.533
ORDER: SVU?

49:05.600 --> 49:07.366
IS IT REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR A

49:07.433 --> 49:09.233
5TH GRADER?

49:09.300 --> 49:10.266
I'D BE A LITTLE CONCERNED IF MY

49:10.333 --> 49:11.900
KID STOPPED ASKING MY WHY

49:11.966 --> 49:13.166
SPONGEBOB LIVES IN A PINEAPPLE

49:13.233 --> 49:14.666
AND STARTED ASKING ME HOW SEMEN

49:14.733 --> 49:15.666
COULD END UP IN A DEAD PERSON'S

49:15.733 --> 49:25.733
THROAT.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.033
NEW RULE: IF MEN ARE EXPECTED TO

49:28.100 --> 49:30.866
KNOW 45 SEXUAL POSITIONS, AS

49:30.933 --> 49:33.366
MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE SUGGESTS,

49:33.433 --> 49:34.766
THEY MUST BE ALLOWED TO WEAR

49:34.833 --> 49:35.466

49:45.466 --> 49:46.366

49:46.433 --> 49:47.700
I KNOW, IT'S A BIT BULKY AND

49:47.766 --> 49:48.400
MIGHT GET IN THE WAY, BUT HAVING

49:48.466 --> 49:51.300
ANOTHER GUY RUN IN THE PLAYS IS

49:51.366 --> 49:55.366
A TOTAL MOOD-KILLER.

49:55.433 --> 49:56.366
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

49:56.433 --> 49:57.800
SOMEONE MUST EXPLAIN WHY

49:57.866 --> 49:59.333
CELEBRITIES RUNNING FOR HIGH

49:59.400 --> 50:00.666
OFFICE IS A RECURRING NIGHTMARE

50:00.733 --> 50:03.400
WE CAN'T SEEM TO SHAKE.

50:03.466 --> 50:06.466
THE ROCK, CAITLYN JENNER,

50:06.533 --> 50:09.933
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, RANDY QUAID

50:10.000 --> 50:12.233
- THEY ALL HAVE SUGGESTED LATELY

50:12.300 --> 50:12.933
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO RUNNING

50:13.000 --> 50:14.566
THE COUNTRY, THEY HAVE WHAT IT

50:14.633 --> 50:15.733
TAKES, AND THEY DO: MALIGNANT

50:15.800 --> 50:28.566
NARCISSISM.

50:28.633 --> 50:29.333
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:29.400 --> 50:30.500

CAUTIONARY TALE NAMED DONALD

50:32.133 --> 50:33.700
TRUMP?

50:33.766 --> 50:35.266
THE LAST FOUR YEARS WAS A

50:35.333 --> 50:43.433
WARNING, NOT AN INSPIRATION.

50:43.500 --> 50:43.700
[LAUGHTER]

50:43.766 --> 50:44.300
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT

50:44.366 --> 50:44.833

50:44.900 --> 50:45.866
AND THINK, "I GUESS HIGH-LEVEL

50:45.933 --> 50:46.933

50:47.000 --> 50:48.400
PEOPLE WHO'VE TRAINED FOR IT AND

50:48.466 --> 50:50.400
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING."

50:50.466 --> 50:51.633
I'M SURE CAITLYN JENNER IS A

50:51.700 --> 50:53.066
NICE PERSON BUT AS CALIFORNIA

50:53.133 --> 50:54.600
GOVERNOR SHE WOULD BE IN CHARGE

50:54.666 --> 50:57.833

REAL LIFE, ALSO SAYS HE MIGHT

51:25.466 --> 51:28.700
WANT TO RUN OUR STATE.

51:28.766 --> 51:30.733
WHEN DID GOVERNING BECOME THE

51:30.800 --> 51:32.800
SAFETY SCHOOL FOR WHEN THE GUEST

51:38.700 --> 51:39.766

THINGS IN AMERICA HAVE BEEN A

52:05.033 --> 52:06.333
LITTLE DIFFERENT THESE LAST FIVE

52:06.400 --> 52:07.566
MONTHS?

52:07.633 --> 52:08.800
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE

52:08.866 --> 52:10.433

FORMATIVE YEARS NOT ON A SOUND

NOT ENOUGH.

55:24.033 --> 55:25.433
NOT ENOUGH.
