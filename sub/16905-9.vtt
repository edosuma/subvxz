WEBVTT

00:00.633 --> 00:03.625
Liz!
Liz Lemon!

00:03.637 --> 00:07.090
It's me, Thad.
From college.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.391
I've had my skin tags removed

00:08.442 --> 00:09.642
since then so you can
see my eyes now.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.778
You ran the light board
at the theater.

00:11.812 --> 00:15.248
Everyone called you... Thad,
no nickname.

00:15.282 --> 00:18.902
And you, you were the star
<i>The Sound of Music.</i>

00:18.953 --> 00:21.120
Thank you, no everyone thinks
of the young Nazi boy

00:21.155 --> 00:22.355
as the star of that show.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.530
A lot of people didn't
realize that was

00:31.549 --> 00:33.233
the free, unlicensed version.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.468
Look, I know it's last
minute, but I'm having

00:35.502 --> 00:38.371
an epic Leap Day party
this afternoon.

00:38.389 --> 00:41.741
A daytime party
celebrating Leap Day.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.377
Sounds fun, but I have to work.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.595
Hey, Liz, new Bluetooth?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.513
No, I'm talking to someone.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.048
I'm sorry.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.017
I don't see people
that look like that.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.936
Sorry.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.938
That was this creep
I went to college with.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.289
Such a nerd.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.191
And this is coming from
someone who wrote lyrics

00:58.225 --> 01:01.227
to the song the cantina
band playsin <i>Star Wars.</i>

01:06.450 --> 01:08.751
But, at least I don't
throw Leap Day parties.

01:08.786 --> 01:11.754
Wait, that was Thad Warmald,
the billionaire?

01:11.789 --> 01:14.540
No, that was sad Thad
the skintag lad.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.092
I coined that.

01:16.126 --> 01:17.293
That name has been all over

01:17.344 --> 01:19.212
the gold digger message
boards lately.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.214
I don't know a lot
about business,

01:21.248 --> 01:24.017
but he did an Internet and
now the computers like him

01:24.051 --> 01:26.386
and Wall Street is Google.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.021
My God.

01:28.055 --> 01:32.591
We are going to this party and
you're introducing me to Thad.

01:32.610 --> 01:34.978
Liz, I'm on a sexual
walkabout right now.

01:35.029 --> 01:36.595
I need to know if anything can

01:36.614 --> 01:38.264
make me happier
than being with Paul.

01:38.282 --> 01:41.618
And maybe $20 billion
would do it.

01:41.652 --> 01:43.970
What? How much
Internet did he do?

01:44.004 --> 01:46.339
Poke your eye, pull your hair,
you forgot what clothes to wear.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.991
What the hell?

01:48.042 --> 01:49.826
You're not wearing yellow
and blue on Leap Day.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.111
So what?
Leap Day is not a thing.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.005
What the crap
is going on in here?

02:02.056 --> 02:04.691
Why, Leap Day
William is visiting.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.892
Leap Day William?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.560
Miss Lemon, did you
not grow up

02:07.594 --> 02:08.860
with Leap Day William?

02:08.895 --> 02:10.363
He lives
in the Mariana trench.

02:10.396 --> 02:12.482
He emerges every four years

02:12.516 --> 02:14.984
to trade children's
tears for candy?

02:15.019 --> 02:16.436
What? No.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.438
But white haven was
founded by the amish,

02:18.472 --> 02:20.606
and we really only celebrated
their holidays.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.442
After high school,
I went on rumspringa.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.277
It was crazy.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.679
I totally snuck into
<i>The Witches of Eastwick.</i>

02:26.714 --> 02:28.781
But where were you when
we did this four years ago?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.184
Certainly not at a Michael's
crafts crafting cruise.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.503
Miss Lemon,
you are missing out.

02:33.537 --> 02:36.372
Every four years, you get
a magical extra day.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.324
A day to do the things you
ordinarily wouldn't do.

02:38.342 --> 02:39.325
To take chances!

02:39.343 --> 02:41.027
For instance, I am wearing

02:41.061 --> 02:42.996
a braided necklace with
a shark's tooth on it.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.831
I listened to rap music
for the first time.

02:45.849 --> 02:46.999
Not a fan.

02:47.017 --> 02:48.201
And you and I
are going to a party

02:48.235 --> 02:49.602
thrown by a billionaire.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.722
Come on, take a leap, Liz.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.359
Okay, fine, I'll go, but
if he has a giant chandelier

02:56.393 --> 02:57.510
in his house, I'm out.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.362
Those things fall.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.646
Waah, waah.

S06 Ep09 - Leap Day

03:20.279 --> 03:23.579
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:25.506 --> 03:26.806
Happy Leap Day, Lemon.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.591
- Help yourself to some rhubarb.
- Rhubarb?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.676
Is white haven the only city
in America

03:30.710 --> 03:32.045
that doesn't celebrate Leap Day?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.180
It's not such a big deal
in Boston, either.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.350
Just a Leap Day William parade,
citywide ice maze

03:37.384 --> 03:38.985
and, uh, we don't poke you
in the eye

03:39.019 --> 03:40.553
if you're not
wearing yellow and blue.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.438
We just, uh, stomp on your foot.-

03:42.489 --> 03:44.407
Kick you in the knee,
Yankees suck, go pats.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.992
I can't believe
the woman who watches

03:46.026 --> 03:48.394
all six
pawn shop reality shows

03:48.429 --> 03:51.080
has never seen the movie,
<i>Leap Dave Williams.</i>

03:51.115 --> 03:52.898
I'm sorry,
is <i>Leap Dave Williams</i>

03:52.916 --> 03:54.951
a play on Leap Day William?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.953
It's a classic.
Uptight lawyer Dave Williams

03:57.004 --> 03:58.571
turns into the real
Leap Day William

03:58.605 --> 04:00.840
after an ice fishing trip
gone awry.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.210
USA runs an all day marathon.

04:06.096 --> 04:08.114
Dave, is everything all right?

04:08.148 --> 04:10.316
I definitely don't have gills.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.584
I mean, nothing.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.953
I mean, yes.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.154
Oh, my God, that's what Chris
kept quoting this morning

04:16.190 --> 04:17.857
during our love... making.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.309
New assistant
reporting for duty.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.994
Kenneth's filling in.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.129
Gabe's got the weak off.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.297
He's a mormon.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.465
You know how they are
about Leap Day.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.099
No, I don't, I don't know th...

04:29.153 --> 04:30.736
Fine, I didn't wanna
have to do this,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.772
but I am wearing
yellow and blue.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.280
Kenneth, I'm hoping to find
you a permanent position

04:41.298 --> 04:43.249
here at the company, but it's
hard to take you seriously

04:43.283 --> 04:44.817
when you're dressed like that.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.469
I'm sorry, sir.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.504
I just get so excited
spreading holiday cheer.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.840
Well, certainly you remember
the joy that fills

04:50.891 --> 04:53.292
a young boy's heart
on the day of leap.

04:53.310 --> 04:55.394
Don't get me wrong,
I love this holiday.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.629
But do you know why?

04:56.647 --> 04:58.397
Sir, I never know why.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.067
Because it's an extra day
to do business.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.202
A bonus profit opportunity.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.171
I have a bet with my business
school roommates

05:05.205 --> 05:06.472
every four years to see

05:06.490 --> 05:08.641
who can make the most money
on Leap Day.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.694
And that is why I am announcing
today that cable town is

05:11.745 --> 05:16.082
purchasing Xaro,
the 3-D Internet company.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.252
It'll be like those Bible
quotes are right in your face.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.921
Yes, now take off
that bald cap, Kenneth.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.988
We have a lot of work to do.

05:23.006 --> 05:25.391
Of course,
take off my bald cap.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.427
Not put on my wig.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.134
Well, he's definitely rich.

05:41.058 --> 05:43.442
Look how lame this crowd is.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.945
Thad's been in his little
nerd world for so long

05:45.979 --> 05:49.248
and now he's peeping out
of his shell like a... um,

05:49.283 --> 05:50.683
oh, what's that animal?

05:50.717 --> 05:53.402
You know, the one that crosses
so slowly across the road

05:53.453 --> 05:56.055
and then you swerve to make sure
you hit it and then a car

05:56.089 --> 05:59.041
coming the other way swerves to
avoid you and goes off a cliff.

05:59.076 --> 06:01.627
And then that night you and your
companion have the greatest sex

06:01.662 --> 06:03.563
of your lives because
you're both sharing a secret.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.365
- It's a turtle, Jenna.
- Yes, he's a turtle.

06:06.383 --> 06:07.717
And he's coming out of his shell

06:07.751 --> 06:09.168
for the first time.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.205
And when he does,
he's gonna see this.

06:15.726 --> 06:18.728
We really gotta get all
the furniture out of here?

06:18.762 --> 06:20.396
My aquarium guy's
coming to see about

06:20.430 --> 06:22.431
turning this whole room
into an aquarium.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.985
Who's really in the aquarium?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.554
The fish or us?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.156
Greetings, coworkers.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.074
Mr. Donaghy would
like to inform you that,

06:32.109 --> 06:35.027
"unfortunately due to the Obama
worldwide recession,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.530
"there will be no Leap Day
bonuses this year.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.916
"Mean laughter, sound of
a drink being poured.

06:39.950 --> 06:42.568
"What are you writing now,
you slack-jawed donkey?

06:43.954 --> 06:45.204
What are all
these letters, tray?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.789
It's just fan mail.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.007
I mean, would you read
a bunch of letters

06:48.041 --> 06:50.176
from people
who look up to me?

06:50.210 --> 06:53.262
A $50,000 benihana gift card?

06:53.297 --> 06:55.715
Right, I did
an ad and insisted on

06:55.749 --> 06:57.149
being paid in beni bucks.

06:57.184 --> 07:01.687
No sir, this card is only
good through February 2012.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.390
Any other year
it'd be march already.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.492
But we found it today!

07:06.526 --> 07:08.144
It's a Leap Day miracle!

07:08.195 --> 07:09.962
Gentlemen, we have
one day to eat

07:09.997 --> 07:12.648
$50,000 worth of Japanese food.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.766
That's impossible.

07:13.784 --> 07:15.801
Nothing's impossible
on Leap Day.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.036
It's like I said in my cameo

07:17.070 --> 07:18.788
appearance in
<i>Leap Dave Williams,</i>

07:18.822 --> 07:22.658
"gimme your wallet, old man!"

07:22.709 --> 07:25.294
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to introduce you

07:25.329 --> 07:27.146
to the future of Kabletown,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.848
the future of web-browsing,

07:28.882 --> 07:31.017
and, quite frankly,
the future.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.053
Welcome to the age
of 3-D Internet.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.799
<i>Following an unintentionally
racist press conference...</i>

07:46.817 --> 07:48.567
<i>Help us to "Whip"
the competition.</i>

07:48.602 --> 07:49.802
<i>Kabletown shares
down sharply...</i>

07:49.836 --> 07:52.171
Careful, sir,
those leaves are poisonous.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.991
You know the saying,
"rhubarb red, eat away,

07:55.025 --> 07:57.526
rhubarb green,
don't eat them."

07:57.577 --> 07:59.478
Kenneth, I've watched newt
gingrich eat a plate of ribs.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.980
I think my stomach can handle
some rhubarb leaves.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.250
Do you have any idea how long
you'll be needing me today?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.918
One of my birds is sick

08:05.952 --> 08:07.703
and I want to get home
in time to baptize her.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.706
We're both staying here until
I come up with an idea

08:10.757 --> 08:12.625
to turn this day around.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.227
Now, would you watch
a television show...

08:15.262 --> 08:16.562
And I'm just
spitballing here...

08:16.596 --> 08:18.164
Called <i>spitball?</i>

08:18.198 --> 08:20.499
Sir, Rebecca Birdstein
needs me.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.202
Kenneth, we all have
to make sacrifices.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.738
Watch this.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.973
Sherry, I'm afraid something
has come up at work

08:28.008 --> 08:29.375
and you'll have to
stay late with Liddy.

08:29.409 --> 08:33.111
Just dab some scotch on
your neck and make your eyes

08:33.145 --> 08:35.514
the color of a winter crystal
so she'll think you're me.

08:35.532 --> 08:37.283
Thank you Sherry.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.517
Good night.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.535
How many rooms are in...

08:44.041 --> 08:45.908
It's my, uh, d&d room.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.195
The gaming table comes up
out of the floor.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.196
Table!

08:51.765 --> 08:54.199
Frak, I'm supposed to say
"floor" first.

08:55.886 --> 08:57.420
Forget it, damn it!

08:58.922 --> 09:02.808
- This is all for you, Liz.
- What?

09:02.843 --> 09:06.045
I have been in love with you
since college.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.748
Watching you every
night on that stage

09:08.782 --> 09:11.417
and realizing my dad was wrong.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.785
I do like girls.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.186
Oh, boy. Okay.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.956
The party, the New York
apartment, everything.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.559
Do you know why I spun off Xaro
and sold it to Kabletown?

09:20.594 --> 09:24.196
Just so I could
accidentally run into you.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.249
That is why it's called Xaro.

09:27.284 --> 09:31.287
In <i>Game of Thrones,</i> Xaro
is a rich merchant prince

09:31.338 --> 09:37.743
who wishes to acquaint himself
with the mother of dragons.

09:37.761 --> 09:41.847
Great, well... Scooby Doo!

09:41.882 --> 09:45.117
Liz, wait!
$10 million!

09:45.152 --> 09:47.720
I want you
to take my virginity

09:47.754 --> 09:49.121
on leap night

09:49.156 --> 09:51.924
for $10 million.

09:51.942 --> 09:53.109
Fine, 20.

09:53.143 --> 09:54.810
- No, Thad, I...
- Don't answer yet.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.645
I mean, okay, unless you
were gonna say yes.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.482
- No, you heard me say no.
- Don't answer yet.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.267
Don't answer yet.

10:06.931 --> 10:09.933
Come... ... on.

10:18.109 --> 10:20.110
Son of a <i>glub.</i>

10:24.532 --> 10:27.751
Mr. Jordan, you'll never
spend all this by midnight.

10:27.785 --> 10:30.153
You appeared in
that ad for nothing.

10:30.188 --> 10:31.822
Well the joke's
on you because that

10:31.856 --> 10:35.242
commercial never aired
for unexplained reasons.

10:36.661 --> 10:38.695
I just touched the table again.

10:38.713 --> 10:40.797
God, you call for help!

10:40.832 --> 10:43.917
I'll just put my head on
the table for a second.

10:43.968 --> 10:47.938
Now let's get started, bring us
a bottle of your finest wine.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.039
Of course, Mr. Jordan.

10:49.073 --> 10:52.709
That will be $12.

10:52.744 --> 10:55.812
Hey, Liz.
I can't find Thad.

10:55.847 --> 10:58.382
Thad just
<i>indecentproposal-ed</i> me.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.767
One night, $20 million.

11:00.818 --> 11:03.820
Oh, my God, that's
the gold digger's dream.

11:03.855 --> 11:05.055
- Where is he?
- No, Jenna.

11:05.073 --> 11:06.256
You don't understand.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.658
He's been in love
with me since college.

11:07.692 --> 11:09.059
He only wants me.

11:09.077 --> 11:10.577
And you're still here.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.129
You're considering it.

11:12.163 --> 11:14.564
Liz, you know you're
not doing this.

11:14.582 --> 11:16.833
I'm on a sexual walkabout.

11:16.868 --> 11:19.235
But you're a nice girl
with a live-in boyfriend.

11:19.253 --> 11:22.439
<i>Honey, I'm about to do
something pretty... crazy.</i>

11:22.473 --> 11:23.874
<i>You should.</i>

11:23.908 --> 11:25.909
<i>It's Leap Day.
Real life is for march.</i>

11:25.944 --> 11:27.644
<i>No, just hear me out.</i>

11:27.679 --> 11:30.247
- Because if this doesn't work...
- It doesn't matter.

11:30.281 --> 11:32.582
Nothing that happens on
Leap Day counts.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.552
Nothing that happens
on Leap Day counts.

11:35.586 --> 11:38.922
Well, then, here goes nothing.

11:45.196 --> 11:46.396
Hey, Liz, what's up?

11:46.431 --> 11:48.432
Criss, I'm about to do
something pretty crazy.

11:48.466 --> 11:49.983
You should, it's Leap Day.

11:50.034 --> 11:52.202
- Real life is for march.
- Oh, boy.

11:52.236 --> 11:54.621
No, hear me out, because this
could really ruin...

11:54.656 --> 11:55.872
No, it doesn't matter.

11:55.907 --> 11:57.407
Nothing that happens
on Leap Day counts.

11:57.442 --> 11:58.742
Hey, listen, I gotta run,

11:58.776 --> 12:02.212
but whatever it is,
go for it.

12:02.246 --> 12:03.947
My.

12:03.982 --> 12:08.301
It looks like we've got
a slut-off on our hands.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.454
We've only spent $6000.

12:11.472 --> 12:12.756
We should just give up.

12:12.790 --> 12:15.192
- Never.
- We can't keep eating!

12:15.226 --> 12:17.661
Lutz's shirt button popped off
and hit Cerie.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.363
It counts as us touching.

12:19.397 --> 12:20.630
This is important.

12:20.648 --> 12:21.732
Everybody's always telling me

12:21.766 --> 12:23.400
not to get paid in gift cards.

12:23.434 --> 12:26.937
Angie, my lawyer,
my imaginary friend, Dotcom.

12:26.971 --> 12:28.155
Tray, I'm real.

12:28.189 --> 12:29.506
I moved your furniture.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.491
And, yeah, Leap Day has
become too commercial.

12:31.526 --> 12:33.377
And people have forgotten
what it really means,

12:33.411 --> 12:34.978
but I remember.

12:35.013 --> 12:38.248
One Leap Day when I was a kid,
the Harlem River froze,

12:38.282 --> 12:41.651
and I decided to cross it
carrying my brick collection.

12:41.669 --> 12:42.652
I told him not to.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.354
No one can hear you, Dotcom.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.023
Then I fell through the ice.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.991
They still don't know
who pulled me out.

12:48.026 --> 12:49.092
I did.

12:49.127 --> 12:51.395
Charlie Rangel gave me a medal.

12:51.429 --> 12:53.630
I like to think it was
Leap Day William.

12:53.664 --> 12:55.198
You really believe
in Leap Day William?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.600
I used to.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.535
Then I tried to eat
all this benihana.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.138
Now I don't know anymore.

13:01.172 --> 13:03.306
I gotta take a walk.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.691
Do some thinking.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.610
But I can explain.

13:06.644 --> 13:08.862
I'm Leap Day Williams!

13:08.896 --> 13:11.448
No, really!

13:11.482 --> 13:13.183
Please, believe me.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.517
Have a little faith.

13:14.535 --> 13:16.486
Boy.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.288
I'm getting sleepy.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.527
You're famous.

13:23.561 --> 13:25.028
I have screen grabs of
all your nip s.

13:26.664 --> 13:28.665
You know what, Thad?
I was trying to remember.

13:28.699 --> 13:32.202
What was the dance that Rolf
did for Liesl?

13:32.220 --> 13:33.904
Did it go like this?

13:33.938 --> 13:37.557
Yes.

13:37.592 --> 13:39.376
That's it.

13:39.410 --> 13:42.062
That's how Rolf danced.

13:44.682 --> 13:49.853
Why don't you go and get me
and Liz some drinks?

13:49.887 --> 13:52.072
Very well.

13:52.106 --> 13:55.108
Liz, a moment, please?

13:57.111 --> 13:59.696
If you're really gonna do this,
you better get a move on.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.564
Right now, there are
models waking up

14:01.582 --> 14:04.117
from their coke binges,
multi-ethnic bartenders

14:04.168 --> 14:06.620
with daddy issues, former
ballerinas who had to quit

14:06.671 --> 14:08.271
because their boobs
got too big.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.574
They're gonna hear about
the horny billionaire,

14:10.608 --> 14:13.510
and Thad's gonna forget all
about his little crush.

14:13.544 --> 14:15.879
They're coming Liz.
Click click.

14:15.913 --> 14:18.932
That's their stilettos.

14:18.966 --> 14:21.268
Click click.

14:21.302 --> 14:23.320
Sir?

14:23.354 --> 14:25.755
Sir, you don't look so good.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.491
You shouldn't have eaten
those rhubarb leaves.

14:27.525 --> 14:29.459
I can't be sick.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.394
I won't lose money
on Leap Day.

14:31.428 --> 14:34.430
I'm just gonna rest a second.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.037
Please get better, sir.

14:41.072 --> 14:43.073
I've dug too many graves.

14:48.963 --> 14:51.447
Why the long face, son?

14:51.465 --> 14:53.783
I do have a long,
elegant face, thank you,

14:53.801 --> 14:56.987
but I can't enjoy your
compliment, because I'm sad.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.456
I'm starting to think Leap Day
William isn't even real.

15:00.474 --> 15:02.676
I reckon you may be right.

15:02.727 --> 15:06.663
Leap Day William's probably
just a tall tale told to kids

15:06.697 --> 15:08.464
to help sell candy.

15:08.482 --> 15:12.185
But this old fool
still believes he exists,

15:12.236 --> 15:14.971
right here, inside all of us.

15:14.989 --> 15:17.140
I am always coughing up blood.

15:17.175 --> 15:19.943
Could that be Leap Day William
trying to get out?

15:19.977 --> 15:23.997
Might could be, but I think if
he were here right now,

15:24.031 --> 15:25.916
Leap Day William would tell you

15:25.950 --> 15:29.870
everything's gonna
be all right, Tracy,

15:29.921 --> 15:33.557
as long as you remember
where you come from.

15:33.591 --> 15:35.325
Thanks.

15:35.359 --> 15:36.660
Nice costume, by the way.

15:36.694 --> 15:39.696
Right, costume.

15:44.602 --> 15:47.520
So, what should we do now?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.739
Stop pressuring me.

15:49.774 --> 15:52.342
What are you?
An intercourse monster?

15:52.376 --> 15:55.478
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.

15:55.512 --> 16:00.016
Is sex like when the Na'vi
intertwine their hair braids?

16:00.051 --> 16:01.384
Sure.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.088
Yeah, Thad, that's exactly
what it's like.

16:05.122 --> 16:06.907
Okay, look, if we're
gonna do this,

16:06.958 --> 16:09.209
we kinda need to do it now,
okay, before...

16:10.328 --> 16:12.329
No.

16:14.031 --> 16:16.700
Aw, damn it.
Hot bitches.

16:19.884 --> 16:21.184
Wake up, sir!

16:21.188 --> 16:23.205
Wake up.

16:24.958 --> 16:27.076
What is this?

16:27.110 --> 16:28.410
Kenneth, is that me?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.646
I'm not Kenneth.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.631
I'm the spirit of Leap Day.

16:32.666 --> 16:35.818
Welcome to your Leap Day past.

16:35.852 --> 16:38.354
Jackie, we can't go
to the parade today.

16:38.388 --> 16:43.859
I got called into work... at the
hospital... where I'm a nurse.

16:43.894 --> 16:46.428
Why are you showing me this?

16:46.463 --> 16:47.763
This is the kind of adversity

16:47.797 --> 16:49.932
that made me the man
I am today.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.767
Good. Cry.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.969
Let your sadness
form a hole inside you

16:54.004 --> 16:55.404
that can only
be filled with money.

16:55.438 --> 16:58.440
Of course we're going to
the parade today, Jackie.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.543
But you can't have
candy and cigarettes

17:00.577 --> 17:02.311
without a few tears first.

17:02.329 --> 17:03.779
How did I forget this part?

17:03.813 --> 17:05.881
And when did we stop giving
children cigarettes?

17:05.915 --> 17:08.032
It's the liberal war
on Leap Day.

17:08.084 --> 17:11.287
It's time to go,
Mr. Donaghy.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.590
Welcome to Leap Day present.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.560
Okay, I'll change
me eye color,

17:17.594 --> 17:20.095
but it seem like
a waste of voodoo.

17:20.130 --> 17:23.682
Good night, Mr. Donaghy.

17:23.717 --> 17:25.233
Sorry, baby.

17:25.268 --> 17:27.469
Daddy not coming home
tonight because of work.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.355
It's a good lesson.

17:29.389 --> 17:31.273
This will help her in life.

17:31.308 --> 17:34.310
Are you sure?

17:34.344 --> 17:36.011
Welcome to the future.

17:36.046 --> 17:38.013
Five leap days from now.

17:38.031 --> 17:39.014
That's Liddy.

17:39.049 --> 17:41.817
I assume this
is her horse stable

17:41.851 --> 17:44.887
and that she's hammering
that nail as a funny joke.

17:44.921 --> 17:45.988
No, Mr. Donaghy.

17:46.022 --> 17:48.424
She's doing habitat
for humanity.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.459
After you missed
all her leap days,

17:50.493 --> 17:52.895
she started experimenting
with liberalism.

17:52.929 --> 17:55.030
That's not her.
It can't be.

17:55.065 --> 17:56.865
What have you done
with my daughter?

17:56.883 --> 17:58.217
Where is Liddy?

17:58.251 --> 18:00.803
She's at home, sir.

18:00.837 --> 18:03.806
With the nanny.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.040
There's still time.

18:05.058 --> 18:07.542
Kenneth, I want you
to go to citarella

18:07.560 --> 18:09.428
and buy the biggest
rhubarb there is.

18:09.479 --> 18:10.879
The one that's
as big as me, sir?

18:10.897 --> 18:12.714
That's the one.

18:12.732 --> 18:16.551
But first, you take Rebecca
Birdstein to the vet.

18:16.569 --> 18:17.853
What a Mitzvah.

18:17.887 --> 18:19.688
Merry Leap Day, sir.

18:19.722 --> 18:21.573
Merry Leap Day to us all!

18:23.026 --> 18:25.077
Liz, why don't you go and...

18:25.111 --> 18:26.495
Get you and Karolina
some drinks?

18:26.529 --> 18:27.896
Okay, fine.

18:27.914 --> 18:30.916
Looks like this time the male
will be in the Czech.

18:30.950 --> 18:34.703
That kind of wit is a thing
she will never give you.

18:34.737 --> 18:38.073
Hey, Liz, a gym teacher on
a sex tour of Indonesia called.

18:38.108 --> 18:39.875
He wants his shirt back.

18:39.909 --> 18:42.277
Okay, that's solid, Kurkova.

18:42.312 --> 18:44.930
That's a good burn.

18:44.964 --> 18:47.933
What was that old man
trying to tell me?

18:47.967 --> 18:51.687
What am I gonna do with
all this free food?

18:51.721 --> 18:52.938
Remember where I came from.

18:52.972 --> 18:56.225
But we all came from the sea.
Sea?

18:56.259 --> 18:59.111
Like the letter "C",
which is part of the alphabet.

18:59.145 --> 19:01.530
Alphabet soup.

19:01.564 --> 19:03.966
Soup kitchen.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.568
- Kitchen...
- No, no, don't keep going.

19:06.602 --> 19:08.704
The kitchen debate
with Richard Nixon.

19:08.738 --> 19:10.439
Richard M. Nixon.

19:10.473 --> 19:12.141
The M-train.

19:12.175 --> 19:14.510
Soul train.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.112
<i>Chicken soup for the soul.</i>

19:17.147 --> 19:19.248
Chicken soup.

19:19.282 --> 19:22.951
Soup kitchen.

19:22.969 --> 19:25.971
This is a Leap Day miracle!

19:27.790 --> 19:29.925
Merry Leap Day, tourists.

19:29.959 --> 19:34.396
Merry Leap Day, closeted gay
guys meeting in the city.

19:39.853 --> 19:40.903
Really?

19:40.937 --> 19:42.637
Seriously 20 million bucks?

19:42.655 --> 19:44.773
I would sleep
with Thad Warmald for that.

19:44.807 --> 19:45.908
Couldn't go through with it.

19:45.942 --> 19:47.242
You know, I just kept
seeing your face.

19:47.277 --> 19:48.510
Also, I have too much dignity.

19:48.545 --> 19:50.162
So another woman?

19:50.196 --> 19:51.780
Victoria's secret model.

19:51.814 --> 19:54.816
Feast, homeless, feast!

20:00.090 --> 20:02.458
I saved Leap Day!

20:02.492 --> 20:05.494
And connected with my son!

20:05.512 --> 20:08.830
And I solved the big case
from earlier!

20:08.848 --> 20:11.934
Merry Leap Day, everybody!

20:11.968 --> 20:14.136
Hey!
Take a leap, pal!

20:14.170 --> 20:16.505
That's the spirit!

20:21.861 --> 20:25.781
Happy Leap Day,
sweetheart.

20:25.815 --> 20:27.382
Yes!

20:37.049 --> 20:40.494
Well, I guess we all
learned something tonight

20:40.495 --> 20:42.400
about love and friendship,

20:42.401 --> 20:43.966
about taking chances,

20:43.967 --> 20:46.723
about the true
meaning of Leap Day.

20:46.734 --> 20:50.237
But, these lessons aren't good
just for every four years.

20:50.271 --> 20:52.472
No. They're good
every year.

20:52.507 --> 20:55.909
Because we should live
every day

20:55.943 --> 20:59.046
as if it's Leap Day,
and every Leap Day

20:59.080 --> 21:01.198
as if it's your last.

21:01.249 --> 21:04.951
And if you should ever see
an old man in a blue suit

21:04.986 --> 21:07.204
busting out of the middle
of the ocean,

21:07.255 --> 21:09.322
take the time to say <i>howdy</i>.

21:09.340 --> 21:12.659
It might just be
worth your while.
