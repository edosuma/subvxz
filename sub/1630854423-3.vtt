WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:06.965
Well, thank you guys for gathering.

00:07.049 --> 00:11.011
I called you to this emergency meeting
because I have some news.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.055
Jo, you might wanna film for posterity.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.433
So, here's the news.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.519
-In a meeting! Leave!
-Okay.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.770
It's okay. He can stay.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.396
You might wanna hear this.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.940
-Nah, I'm good.
-Stay and listen!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.024
Okay.

00:24.733 --> 00:28.820
Anyway, Montreal just called
with some rather surprising news.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.864
You got named
in the sexual harassment lawsuit.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.323
You better lawyer up.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.909
-I'll make some calls.
-I don't need a lawyer.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.578
You're gonna want a lawyer. The guys
in prison who represented themselves,

00:36.662 --> 00:39.414
they always got the longest sentences.
Harassment stuff's hard to shake.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.500
I've not been named
in a sexual harassment lawsuit.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.335
-Good defense.
-It's not a defense. It's the truth.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.421
I've never sexually assaulted anyone.
So, Jo, please stop filming.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.548
Yeah, okay.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.258
Okay, then what's the news?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.968
They wanna make a Mythic Quest movie,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.178
and I'm gonna be named
the executive producer.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.429
That's all.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.181
Aren't you already the executive producer?

00:56.265 --> 00:57.975
Of the game, not of the movie.
Thought it was--

00:58.058 --> 00:59.852
-Celebrate this man!
-Don't force it.

00:59.935 --> 01:03.146
David, this was neither an emergency,
nor a meeting.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.065
-And I don't have time for it.
-Yeah.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.109
W-- Hold on. Where you going?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.612
No, I thought you were done
bragging about your successes,

01:10.696 --> 01:14.491
and I have to get back to handling
the trash in order to stay out of prison.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.451
I can stay if you want
to talk about your salary, or…

01:16.535 --> 01:17.995
-All right. Just go.
-Okay.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.874
How dare they disrespect you.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.168
You wanted to share your achievements,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.628
and they come in here
looking like sad sacks?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.506
-I can make them sad.
-What?

01:29.590 --> 01:30.799
I can put them in sacks.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.677
No, Jo. You're coming off
a little intense, even for you.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.387
You know what? Take the day off, you know.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.681
-Go hang out with your friends.
-Friends.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.558
Actually, you know what, Jo?

01:40.851 --> 01:44.438
On your way down, stop by GrimPop.
Send Ian up.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.441
Well, he's always wanted
to bring MQ to Hollywood,

01:47.941 --> 01:49.693
but I'm the first one to pull it off.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.238
Yes, send him up.

01:53.822 --> 01:58.076
I wanna watch his weird square face fall
when I tell him the news.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.039
This is the year of Brittlesbee.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.640
Come on, code baby, code. Work for Mama.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.184
That's it. Now don't you embarrass me,

02:22.267 --> 02:25.771
or you won't be getting any french fries,
not even one.

02:27.731 --> 02:28.899
Okay.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.864
Yes!

02:37.616 --> 02:41.161
Slice, slice, baby
Slice, slice

02:42.329 --> 02:46.333
How the rest of the song goes.
Ian, once again I have…

02:49.253 --> 02:50.712
done the impossible.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.558
Hey! Ole tester,
get your grubby mitts off my chips.

03:02.641 --> 03:06.520
Hi! Sorry, I was just trying to get
a snack for the road.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.688
Is Dana around?

03:07.771 --> 03:11.066
Nah, nah,
I shat out some busywork programming tool

03:11.149 --> 03:13.485
for her and Ian so they'd leave me alone.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.946
-I think they took it out to the desert.
-Why the desert?

03:16.029 --> 03:17.489
Ian likes a dramatic backdrop.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.658
Right now
they're probably getting in the zone

03:19.741 --> 03:22.244
and, like, shoving crystals
up their asses and meditating.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.580
-Wait, what?
-Anyway, who cares what they're doing?

03:24.663 --> 03:28.125
He doesn't care that I've been grinding
on this vertical slice for weeks,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.918
and I finally finished it like a boss.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.296
-Hey! That's awesome!
-Now go away.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.882
I've gotta tune
this predictive simulation engine.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.010
Wait,
you just accomplished something huge.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.846
You can't just go back to working.
We need to celebrate.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.141
-We?
-Yeah, I did say "we".

03:45.184 --> 03:46.935
Yeah, sure. Why not?

03:47.019 --> 03:49.771
School can wait.
You know what we should do?

03:50.272 --> 03:52.357
We should go to brunch, huh?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.443
Nothing says a party like pancakes.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.988
You know, pancakes.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.782
Do you like pancakes? Maple syrup?
I don't know what your vibe is.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.785
-Waffles? Give me something.
-I do like pancakes.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.121
Okay, 'cause you were really
not emoting at all.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.664
You know what? Screw it.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.875
If Ian gets to go out to the desert
and get naked

04:09.958 --> 04:11.793
and smoke peyote
with a bunch of crypto bros,

04:11.877 --> 04:13.712
then I can have fun too.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.882
That was extremely specific.
Should I be worried? Is Dana okay?

04:16.964 --> 04:20.260
Ian!

04:21.053 --> 04:23.764
-Ian Elizabeth Grimm.
-Is that his middle name?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.098
Where's the man of the house?

04:25.182 --> 04:27.643
I'm here to retrieve him for David,
and it's of the utmost importance.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.020
-Ian!
-Stop yelling! He's not here.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.105
He and Dana are probably
in a sweat lodge somewhere,

04:32.189 --> 04:33.815
just beating themselves with dry branches.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.108
Is that what's happening?

04:35.192 --> 04:37.819
I'll text him. I'll tell him
that David's looking for him.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.363
Okay, good.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.323
Task complete.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.749
That means I'm done for the day.

04:52.042 --> 04:56.880
So, I am going to go hang out

04:56.964 --> 04:59.424
with my friends.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.692
Jo, do you like pancakes?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.830
Hey, Carol. Can I take out your trash?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.331
-Go nuts.
-Thanks.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.379
-You okay?
-Busy.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.589
Yeah. I can see that.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.842
You know, as janitor,
I see a lot of things.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.763
Like the three or four résumés a day
that you've been throwing in the trash,

05:47.264 --> 05:49.016
or the buildup of smudges
on your phone screen

05:49.099 --> 05:53.312
from playing so much Candy Crush
that you must be on level 198.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.855
I'm on 247.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.983
Damn, see. I mean,
the old Brad would've gotten that dead-on.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.778
Fine. I'm not okay. And I'm not busy.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.740
I mean,
your girl on struggle street, honestly.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.992
Let me guess.
You're having a crisis of conscience

06:07.075 --> 06:09.453
because Montreal made you the HODI,

06:09.536 --> 06:10.746
-but they won't--
-HODI?

06:10.829 --> 06:13.957
The HODI.
The Head of Diversity and Inclusion.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.293
HODI. I figured
you were sick of saying the full title.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.628
Yeah, I am.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.713
So they made you the HODI,
but they won't give you money

06:19.796 --> 06:21.298
-to make an actual difference.
-Yes.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.092
Yep. You just need to make
a whole bunch of money out of thin air.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.094
That's all I need to do, huh?

06:26.178 --> 06:29.348
Old Brad used to do that every day back
when I was the HOMIE.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.392
Okay, tell me what HOMIE is--

06:32.476 --> 06:34.937
Head of Monetization
and Internet E-Commerce. The HOMIE.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.191
-Sure.
-But, you know, that was a long time ago.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.943
Long time ago.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.488
It wasn't that long ago.

06:45.239 --> 06:49.117
-Can I talk to old Brad for a second?
-Wait, you wanna talk to the HOMIE?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.162
Yep, I wanna talk to HOMIE.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.209
Walk with me.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.090
A lot of filming in Bulgaria these days,

07:03.173 --> 07:06.009
but I've got my fingers crossed
for Iceland, you know.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.679
It's where I proposed to my ex-wife.

07:08.762 --> 07:13.183
Sort of a full-circle moment to come back
a successful movie producer, I suppose.

07:13.976 --> 07:14.977
Either way,

07:15.394 --> 07:20.232
I just want you to hear it from me
before it hits the old trades.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.609
You know, again, it's nothing personal.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.694
It's just "bidness".

07:25.279 --> 07:26.530
Just "bidness".

07:26.822 --> 07:28.490
-That's good.
-Yeah, you like that?

07:28.574 --> 07:31.076
You know,
things have just been so much better

07:31.159 --> 07:32.661
since you started leading MQ.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.663
-You know, you gave me your old office…
-Well.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.000
…and access to fresh air and sunlight.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.169
You know,
my plants and I are forever in your debt.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.172
Yeah, I see you have a lot of plants
and cat things too.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.591
-A lot of cat things.
-Well, I hope to have one, one day.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.092
Fingers crossed.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.094
-You don't have a cat?
-Not yet.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.138
Now, can I just ask
for one more little favor?

07:51.221 --> 07:52.514
-Sure thing.
-Don't do it.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.433
Sorry?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.602
The players,
they hate adaptations of games.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.688
-They haven't even seen ours.
-They don't have to, and they won't.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.191
They will band together online,
ruin its reputation,

08:02.274 --> 08:04.318
and spew pure evil at us.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.237
-Specifically me.
-Okay, Sue, ours is gonna be different.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.489
You know, it'll be accessible to everyone,
not just gamers.

08:09.573 --> 08:14.286
They will hate that, all right?
This game is their special place.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.246
You can't just waltz into
someone's special place

08:16.330 --> 08:17.414
and mess with their stuff.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.166
They'll lose their gosh darn minds!

08:20.751 --> 08:22.169
You're right.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.756
A certain type of person
just hates not having control.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.716
Well, sure and--

08:27.799 --> 08:31.303
And it might make him cry. Oh, yes.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.013
-Him?
-Ian.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.224
Yeah, well, I sent for him to come up
a while ago,

08:35.307 --> 08:36.600
and he hasn't come up. Why?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.769
Because he's trying to take away
my moment.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.440
Well, I can take back my power
by going into his special place,

08:43.524 --> 08:45.025
shoving the news in his face.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.528
Reclaim my power just like I'm gonna
reclaim that waterfall in Iceland

08:47.611 --> 08:48.612
where I proposed to my wife.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.405
-Ex-wife.
-Yeah, that's what I meant.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.618
Yes. This time it's super personal.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.212
Why are there so many people here?
Don't they have actual jobs?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.089
Jo, brunch is about so much more
than just food.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.215
Yes.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.299
-Right?
-Yeah.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.093
It's a safe space

09:11.176 --> 09:13.637
where we can be ourselves, you know?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.473
-It's like a circle of trust.
-Well said.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.975
You know, we talk, we laugh,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.852
and everyone just feels better.

09:19.935 --> 09:23.689
Yeah, Jo.
Act like you've been to the brunch before.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.025
-Did you say "the brunch?"
-Yeah.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.735
It's just brunch.

09:29.695 --> 09:33.156
No, I know. I just--
We say it different in Australia.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.658
-You say "the brunch" in Australia?
-Yeah.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.327
Is that not how you guys say it?
That's weird.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.787
Ladies, your table's set.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.163
Table's ready, so.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.667
What do you do for work?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.878
Jo, what are you doing? No, no.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.671
-Asking a genuine question.
-I'm sorry.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.590
I don't see what's so wrong with that.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.510
Yeah, Berkeley's actually really great.
I can't wait to go back.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.262
I'm building such a community there.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
Jesus Christ! How much did you order?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.311
The pancakes are for the table, gals.
Dig in.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.063
Although, actually don't eat too much
'cause a lot of it is to-go,

10:05.147 --> 10:07.733
because I'm kind of between paychecks
right now.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.984
You know how it is.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.405
-Poppy, you're paying for this, right?
-Yeah, sure. It's a party.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.617
Hey! Here's to me crushing it at work

10:16.700 --> 10:19.745
and being a total badass
that doesn't need Ian's validation.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.829
Hell, yes!

10:20.913 --> 10:24.041
And here's to me crushing it at school
and making a ton of new friends.

10:24.124 --> 10:24.958
Hey.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.418
Jo, what are you celebrating?

10:27.669 --> 10:30.339
This girl I went to school with
used to bully me.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.174
She lost her house in a tornado.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.262
I did it wrong, didn't I?

10:39.223 --> 10:40.974
No. It-- That-- It was--

10:41.350 --> 10:42.351
Yeah.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.687
You know what?
Here's to Jo crushing it at the brunch.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.565
-It's just brunch, to be clear.
-Uh-huh.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.650
Yeah. No, that's clear.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.614
Brittlesbee in the house!

10:57.741 --> 10:59.493
Stupid office.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.205
Yo, Ian!

11:05.499 --> 11:06.625
Poppy?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.420
Taking your candy.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.470
I mean, are you serious?

11:19.388 --> 11:20.889
All right, gonna stand me up?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.600
All right, power play me.

11:24.768 --> 11:25.853
Sad.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.022
Oh, my God. Looks like a Tokyo subway.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.945
Where's the buttons?
Where are the buttons?

11:39.241 --> 11:40.242
Elevator open?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.745
Activate elevator.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.086
Elevator open.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.006
What the--

11:55.549 --> 11:56.717
Hello!

11:59.720 --> 12:02.639
Okay, not that I care,
but it is kind of annoying

12:02.723 --> 12:05.350
that Ian couldn't even, like,
thumbs up my text.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.268
Yeah, so annoying.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.395
I thought you said
you didn't need his validation.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.607
I don't. I don't, but I just--

12:12.107 --> 12:14.276
Just be on my side, okay, Jo?

12:14.359 --> 12:17.070
Women supporting women
is what the brunch is all about.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.197
-It's just brunch.
-Yeah.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.158
But yes, totally.
You're so right about Ian.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.284
-Screw him.
-Yeah.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.828
He's probably ignoring you because
he feels threatened by your success.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.663
-Yes.
-He's trying to steal your thunder

12:26.747 --> 12:28.373
'cause he can't handle
how empowered you are.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.499
Totally.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.962
Maybe he tried to text you,
but he ended up mangled in a car crash.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.259
I did it wrong again, didn't I?

12:39.843 --> 12:40.886
No, that was great.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.930
-It just trends a little dark.
-It's a little dark.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.181
I don't think he actually crashed.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.433
I just thought we were telling lies
to make ourselves feel better.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.019
Jo, we're not lying,
we're supporting each other.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.730
Okay.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.150
Maybe Ian just sucks.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.196
-Yes. Ian does suck.
-Yes.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.490
-And we are all the best.
-Yes!

13:01.573 --> 13:04.493
We are badass bitches who are popular
and happy, baby!

13:04.576 --> 13:07.246
Yes! To empowered women at brunch.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.956
-Brunch!
-You did it!

13:42.155 --> 13:44.908
I don't want to go back to school.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.620
Everyone there hates me.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.789
Text me back, dick!

13:50.873 --> 13:52.541
And they're all so smart.

13:52.624 --> 13:58.338
Like, I only found out last week
that Beowulf was the name of the author,

13:58.422 --> 13:59.631
not the name of the book.

13:59.715 --> 14:04.761
Like, I thought his name was--
I thought his name was "Bayo Wolf".

14:06.430 --> 14:09.224
They probably think I'm so fucking stupid.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.517
They probably do.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.102
Jo!

14:12.186 --> 14:14.479
I was being supportive.
I was agreeing with you.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.440
At least they notice you at all.

14:16.523 --> 14:21.862
I mean, I've spent every waking moment
of the past decade with Ian, and--

14:21.945 --> 14:23.989
and he doesn't even give a crap about me.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.033
That's so sad.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.915
So, this is brunch.

14:35.459 --> 14:39.338
You want us to design another loot box
for you guys to sell?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.132
We need to make a quick buck.
So I'm gonna need my usual team, okay?

14:42.216 --> 14:44.051
I need Rick, Mellie. I need Kel for sure.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.012
They all quit.
They were overworked and underpaid.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.680
That's the problem, Phil.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.308
We need to fix the entire culture
at this company.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.603
That's right. And that's why we need you
to work through the weekend.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.523
We're gonna generate some revenue
off the backs of these moron players.

14:57.606 --> 15:00.609
Sounds like you're generating revenue
off the backs of us.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.486
I see how you would see that. Okay.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.197
But actually,
the goal here is to increase the budget

15:05.280 --> 15:07.115
so we can bring in some new faces.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.784
You're hiring new people?

15:09.326 --> 15:11.912
But you aren't paying
the ones you already have.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.500
-That's not my department.
-Or mine.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.919
-I'm so confused.
-Okay, sorry.

15:19.002 --> 15:23.006
Phil, to clarify, I'm HODI and he's HOMIE.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.300
Well, technically FHOMIE,
the Former Head of.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.511
But he's helping me out today. Do you see?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.929
HOMIE. FHOMIE.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.099
HODI. CHODI, if you will. Current Head of.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.225
Am I getting fired?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.435
-Wh--
-Fired?

15:35.519 --> 15:37.813
-Why would you think that?
-Because you're head of HR.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.108
I'm HODI, Phil. I just told you that.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.235
Wait, wait, Carol. No, he's right.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.153
-I'm getting fired?
-No.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.196
-Yes.
-What?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.365
-What?
-Okay, maybe not now, but soon.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.367
I mean, this entire model is outdated.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.161
If we're gonna change things,
we got to go big.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.207
-Like, really big.
-Jesus.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.084
Hello?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.380
Hello?

16:04.506 --> 16:08.385
No buttons anywhere.
I mean, not a button on the floor.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.761
Help!

16:14.725 --> 16:17.060
Every morning there's a halo

16:17.144 --> 16:17.978
Pretty good.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.980
Every morning there's a halo

16:20.063 --> 16:24.610
Ninety-one, 92.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.575
Seventy-six trombones
In the big para--

16:34.077 --> 16:38.582
Followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos

16:38.665 --> 16:41.210
Keep the body sharp. Keep the mind sharp.

16:54.223 --> 16:57.601
Yeah, you're gonna die in here.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.483
So, we just wanted to prepare you

17:05.567 --> 17:09.195
for any questions the players might have
about our new NFT initiative.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.448
-Super. Super.
-That's right.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.952
Loot boxes are a thing of the past.
NFTs are the future, Sue.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.373
NFT, huh? Hey, I got an NFT for ya.
No fucking thanks.

17:19.455 --> 17:23.417
-Excuse me?
-No fucking thanks!

17:23.919 --> 17:26.797
N, no. Fucking, F. T, thanks.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.382
-Sue.
-It's okay.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.175
It's good she's approaching this
with her eyes open.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.261
-What do you mean?
-Well, Sue here is about to feel

17:32.344 --> 17:34.847
the weight of the entire gaming Internet
on top of her head.

17:35.556 --> 17:38.767
See, there is nothing
that players hate more than NFTs.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.978
That's not true. Remember DLC in '97?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.688
-Oh, yeah.
-Free to play in 2000.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.273
-Horse armor in '06.
-Oh, God.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.316
Then the loot boxes, season passes.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.235
Gamers hate everything.
Everything new, that is.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.280
But eventually they adopt it,
learn to like it, forget about it,

17:51.363 --> 17:52.447
and then direct their anger

17:52.531 --> 17:54.408
towards the next commodification
of their pleasure.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.909
Now I'm confused.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.704
-Are NFTs good or bad?
-Yes.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.163
That is not an answer.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.332
Where are you going?

18:02.416 --> 18:04.543
No. I'm going back underground
where I was safe.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.504
-From the players?
-No, from you!

18:07.588 --> 18:10.299
You people coming in here
with your crazy ideas,

18:10.382 --> 18:12.968
torturing me with the knowledge
of my future pain.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.846
I was better off in the basement.
In the dark.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.106
Why do we keep finding people
sleeping in our office?

18:26.190 --> 18:27.566
-Should we wake him?
-David!

18:28.483 --> 18:29.526
What the--

18:30.736 --> 18:32.112
Where did you come from?

18:32.196 --> 18:33.864
We've been here all day.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.325
-We were in the lounge.
-There's a lounge?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.619
Where is the lounge?

18:38.702 --> 18:39.995
-It's this way.
-And this way.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.371
-It's both ways.
-And neither.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.125
I hate you both. And neither.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.087
I'm getting the hell out of here.

18:49.171 --> 18:53.300
Okay, how do you call the elevator?

18:53.383 --> 18:54.426
With our minds.

18:54.510 --> 18:58.347
We just think about the elevator
and it comes.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.557
-Really?
-Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

19:00.641 --> 19:01.892
Button right here.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.230
Definitely don't like this.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.150
And how's this for a power move?
I pissed in your office.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.277
It looks like you pissed in your pants.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.781
Well, yeah,
but I pissed in my pants in your office.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.617
So… Oh, no. Is this going up? No.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.410
Just think "down," David.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.998
Office, cyan.

19:25.082 --> 19:26.124
Cyan.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.878
-Yeah. That's nice. That is nice.
-That's nice.

19:42.391 --> 19:46.520
Oh, my God. I have to stop eating gluten.
It really wipes me out.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.771
Where are we?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.941
About 30 minutes outside of Vegas.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.068
Why are we in another state?

19:53.151 --> 19:56.572
To do something
you would never normally do.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.413
A gun range?

20:04.496 --> 20:07.583
-No. I hate guns.
-You know what I hate?

20:07.666 --> 20:10.711
Listening to entitled women cry
into their cheap champagne

20:10.794 --> 20:13.172
and overpriced eggs
about how hard the world is.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.924
But I tried something different,
and it got me out of my funk.

20:16.008 --> 20:17.759
Gave me a fresh perspective.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.720
Now, I'd like to return the favor.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.891
-This is way different to brunch.
-No, it isn't.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.476
You've got your community,
and I've got mine.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.270
-Hey, Kenny.
-Hey, darlin'.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.688
-Shooting or crushing?
-Crushing.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.231
-All right.
-Crushing?

20:31.315 --> 20:33.901
Are we getting crushed?
Are we crushing someone else?

20:33.984 --> 20:35.027
What does that mean?

20:35.110 --> 20:38.572
-This place is shady as shit, Jo.
-To you. It's shady as shit to you.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.325
There are 7 billion people on this planet.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.870
Millions of them would not find
this place shady.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.665
-Is this a weird political thing?
-No, it's not a political thing.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.210
This is a cure to your actual problems.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.547
See, your heads are jammed
so far up your own assholes,

20:55.631 --> 20:57.132
you can't see
there's a whole world out there

20:57.216 --> 20:59.176
that doesn't give a shit about you
or what you're doing.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.636
But the more important you think you are,

21:00.719 --> 21:02.262
the more important you
think your problems are.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.932
And so, you spin and bitch
and bitch and spin.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.142
But today, we're gonna break the cycle.

21:11.355 --> 21:12.523
Yeah!

21:14.274 --> 21:15.692
Crush.

21:15.776 --> 21:18.445
Are we getting in the tank?

21:18.529 --> 21:20.656
I just think that this sends
the wrong message about--

21:20.739 --> 21:23.659
Stop thinking! Stop thinking about
what other people will think about you.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.870
Not Ian, not your douchebag classmates,
not anybody.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.665
The only question
you should be asking yourselves is,

21:29.748 --> 21:35.754
"Do you want to drive the tank?"

21:39.049 --> 21:40.217
Yes.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.677
All right. Let's go.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.893
-Yeah!
-I can't believe this is happening!

21:49.977 --> 21:51.603
I feel so powerful!

22:00.529 --> 22:03.532
Screw Berkeley! Screw Beowulf!

22:06.493 --> 22:09.913
Yeah! I wanna crush something!

22:11.498 --> 22:13.876
Poppy, Ian texted you back!

22:13.959 --> 22:17.963
Ian who? Throw it in the car!
I'm gonna crush it!

22:20.716 --> 22:22.426
Yeah, crush it!

22:32.019 --> 22:33.353
Yes!

22:34.229 --> 22:37.482
Jo, this is so much better than brunch.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.028
Yes.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.529
Do it again!

22:42.613 --> 22:44.448
Do it again! Do it again!

22:44.531 --> 22:47.618
Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!

22:48.911 --> 22:49.995
Friends.
