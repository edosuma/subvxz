For me to talk about the man I have become,
you need to know about the man I was.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.017
I was 14 when I joined the Tartan Gangs

01:31.054 --> 01:35.601
and I was 15 when I joined the
UVF, the Ulster Volunteer Force.

01:37.895 --> 01:40.861
At that time, don't forget,
there were riots on the streets,

01:40.898 --> 01:45.116
every week, petrol bombs every
day and that was just in our town.

01:45.153 --> 01:47.557
When you got home and
switched on the TV,

01:47.558 --> 01:50.992
you could see it was happening
in every other town as well.

01:51.029 --> 01:54.162
And it was like we were under siege.

01:58.208 --> 02:01.504
Fathers and brothers of friends
were being killed in the streets.

02:01.540 --> 02:04.549
And the feeling was, we
all have to do something.

02:06.175 --> 02:09.012
We're all in this together and
we all have to do something.

03:01.568 --> 03:06.662
"The Republican ClubsThanks.

03:06.699 --> 03:11.251
"And after the overnight shootings in
Belfast, three men are still seriously ill.

03:11.287 --> 03:13.574
"Also, as we talk to
The Fianna Fail Party

03:13.575 --> 03:16.188
"about their changed
policy to Northern Ireland,

03:16.225 --> 03:19.020
"The Republican Clubs
Movement has suspended meetings

03:19.021 --> 03:21.090
"and warned members to be on their guard

03:21.126 --> 03:24.015
"after last night's widespread
attacks upon its members.

03:24.051 --> 03:26.675
"Despite the many shootings
only one man was killed.

"In another incident a 22-year-old..."

# I got the money I've got the place

04:15.565 --> 04:19.199

You've got the face

04:19.236 --> 04:25.284
# Let's get together the two of us
Over a glass of champagne

04:26.994 --> 04:28.579
# I've got the music

04:28.616 --> 04:30.128
# I've got the night

04:30.164 --> 04:33.631
# You've got the figure
Put out the light

04:33.668 --> 04:39.049
# Let's get together the two of us
Over a glass of champagne

04:41.551 --> 04:43.345
# I've been waiting

04:43.382 --> 04:45.102
# Much too long

04:45.139 --> 04:48.434
# For this moment to come along
Oh yeah

04:49.477 --> 04:50.561
# Oh yeah

04:51.604 --> 04:55.024
# Oh yeah. #

05:48.165 --> 05:50.000
Come on, come on, come on.

05:50.037 --> 05:51.299
Fuck!

05:51.335 --> 05:52.545
Come on, Mum!

05:52.581 --> 05:53.960
Get down!

05:53.996 --> 05:55.339
Wait...

06:01.847 --> 06:04.266
Oi! Fuck! Run!

06:49.982 --> 06:52.318
All right there, kid? Hi, Jim.

06:54.654 --> 06:56.739
All right?

06:58.533 --> 07:00.373
Heya, Da.

07:00.410 --> 07:02.685
- Hi, Jim. Are you ready for your tea?
- Thanks, Ma.

07:02.686 --> 07:04.915
Go and take a seat and
I'll bring it in to you.

07:08.043 --> 07:09.884
Hey, Jim, Chrissie called for you.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.132
He asked if you were going
out laterI called him earlier.

07:14.759 --> 07:19.347
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

07:19.383 --> 07:21.307
eight, nine, ten.

07:40.578 --> 07:42.163
OK.

07:57.054 --> 07:58.639
One, two, three!

08:09.902 --> 08:14.448
- Come on!  They'llI know!
- I'm doing it!

08:24.167 --> 08:25.856
They've left us some buns.

08:25.893 --> 08:27.509
We've four fucking buns!

08:27.546 --> 08:30.340
- What sort of buns? What colour?
- Iced.  Pink.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.009
Pink! How did they know?

08:33.885 --> 08:36.514
- Ah, fucking hell.
- Eh?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.474
Fucking hell!

08:44.105 --> 08:47.484
- All right, Stuart?  I'll be right with you.
- All right.

08:49.319 --> 08:51.572
All right there, Mr Little, Mrs Little?

08:51.608 --> 08:53.078
- Hello, Stuart.
- Hello.

08:53.115 --> 08:57.328
TV: "He is still alive, isn't he?"

08:57.364 --> 08:58.829
I like this fella here.

08:58.866 --> 09:01.504
Aye, he's not bad.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.507
All right. I'll see you later.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.194
- No drinking now.
- No, Mum. They don't serve drinks at the hop.

09:08.230 --> 09:11.843
Sure, he's a lemonade boy, Mrs
Little, you don't need to worry.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.428
You have a nice evening.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.602
- Did Sammy visit?
- Aye, it's all in the bag.

09:21.187 --> 09:23.481
- So what's the craic?
- I'll tell you in the car.

09:35.327 --> 09:41.130
39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44...

09:41.167 --> 09:45.380
- 45, 46, 47, 48...
- Go into the house.

09:45.416 --> 09:49.610
- Yes, Ma. Yes, Ma.
- Now!

09:49.647 --> 09:53.805
50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56

09:53.842 --> 09:55.098
57, 58...

09:55.599 --> 09:58.894
- See you later, kiddo
-...60,61, ...62,

09:58.931 --> 10:03.316
63, 64, 65, 66...

10:15.329 --> 10:17.977
- All right, lads.
- Where did you get that from. The Windsor ?

10:17.978 --> 10:20.626
-Does it run OK?
- Aye, it's OK.

10:23.337 --> 10:24.922
Craig's barn.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.664
OK, Stuart, open the bag.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.674
He's wanting us to dig his gardens.

11:10.346 --> 11:12.979
Right, this is what's going down.

11:13.016 --> 11:16.874
- You know Colin who works at Castle's Yard...
- Aye, the stonemasons?

11:16.911 --> 11:20.696
The Provies told him that if he
didn't leave, he'd be stiffed,

11:20.733 --> 11:25.696
so I sent the message back, "If you don't
leave, it's one of youse who'll be stiffed."

11:25.733 --> 11:27.782
They haven't withdrawn the threat.

11:31.411 --> 11:33.627
So this is our first kill, boys.

11:33.663 --> 11:35.409
I told Sammy that I wanted to do it.

11:35.410 --> 11:39.044
He said he'd check and see if there
was anything else going down tonight.

11:39.081 --> 11:42.303
He came back to me and
said it was good to go.

11:42.339 --> 11:46.093
- "The hit's yours," he said. He told me
I could pick up the piece.
- Where from?

11:46.130 --> 11:49.803
- You don't ask that.
- Let's see it, Alistair.
- What is it?

11:49.839 --> 11:53.440
- It's a 38. Smith and Wesson.
- Could you not get an automatic?

11:53.476 --> 11:56.918
Nah, Stuart, this is better than
automatics, they jam all the time.

11:56.954 --> 12:00.322
With this, you know, it's not going
to leave me there fucking clicking,

12:00.359 --> 12:05.489
- you know, standing there
with a dick in my hand.
- Aye. How many rounds did you get?

12:05.526 --> 12:07.538
Enough.

12:07.575 --> 12:11.292
He must be reckoning we're
good then to be getting a hit.

12:11.329 --> 12:15.000
- Well, this is the one I asked for
so we better be.
- What did he say,

12:15.036 --> 12:17.382
Sammy, when he said the hit was ours?

12:17.419 --> 12:23.305
He just looked us in the eyes like
he was, you know, he was proud of us.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.609
I'm telling you, it was a good feeling.

12:25.610 --> 12:28.806
We'll be walking into that
bar ten foot tall now, eh?

12:28.843 --> 12:30.605
I can't wait for that.

12:30.642 --> 12:32.519
We have to do it first, mind.

12:32.555 --> 12:35.063
Can I hold it?

12:36.481 --> 12:39.484
Give us a wee jig of
it after you, will you?

12:40.819 --> 12:42.237
Hey, give us a look.

12:44.114 --> 12:49.537
Fucking hell, man! It's
like fucking James Bond, eh?

12:52.415 --> 12:55.543
Powerful, isn't it?

12:56.586 --> 12:58.442
Who is it?

12:58.479 --> 13:00.262
Griffin.

13:00.299 --> 13:04.303
- Griffin?
- He was warned to leave
the yard by the end of the week.

13:04.339 --> 13:05.434
Hang on, Jim Griffin.

13:05.471 --> 13:08.140
- Aye.
- I know him. That's right.

13:08.177 --> 13:10.773
Albert Street, aren't they?

13:10.810 --> 13:14.230
He's leaving the yard anyway,
isn't he? Setting out on his own?

13:14.267 --> 13:18.315
- Griffin, is he?
- That's what I'm hearing.

13:18.351 --> 13:22.364
- Oh, you mean start his own business?
- Aye, that's what I'm hearing.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.954
Hang on, can't be here in Lurgan.

13:23.991 --> 13:26.494
Surely now, not two masons'
yards in the one town?

13:26.530 --> 13:28.960
They're going to be up
and running by Christmas.

13:28.996 --> 13:32.956
- That's what I'm hearing.
- Well, he's still in Castle's now.

13:32.957 --> 13:36.379
- So that's bad luck on him then.
- I know his mother.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.929
She's our dinner lady
at the apprenticeship.

13:38.965 --> 13:42.886
Aye, I know the woman you mean. I don't
know her, like, but I know who you mean.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.678
Sure her sister Catherine
works in the bread shop.

13:45.714 --> 13:48.434
- So is that her son we're doing?
- It's not Albert Street.

13:48.470 --> 13:51.270
- They used to be, I'm sure of it.
- It's Hill Street.

13:51.307 --> 13:54.333
It's 37 Hill Street.

13:54.369 --> 13:57.324
58, 59, 60, 61, 62,

13:57.360 --> 14:01.671
63, 64, 65, 66,

14:01.672 --> 14:04.832
67, 68...

14:04.868 --> 14:08.372
- Go on in now, son.
And do what your brother says.
- Yes, Da.

14:08.409 --> 14:11.042
...72, 73, 74, 75,

14:11.078 --> 14:13.583
76, 77, 78,

14:13.619 --> 14:16.356
79, 80, 81,

14:16.392 --> 14:19.092
82, 83, 84...

14:24.848 --> 14:27.815
When we've done it, we burn
the car, we burn the gear,

14:27.851 --> 14:29.588
we call Sammy and we go to the hop.

14:29.589 --> 14:32.565
We get seen around, a few
dances and then we're back home.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.611
Let's go.

15:44.392 --> 15:47.062
37? You sure?

15:47.099 --> 15:49.732
Aye, it's left.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.278
Army! Down!

16:00.368 --> 16:01.619
What's happened?

16:03.788 --> 16:05.921
They're passing.

16:05.957 --> 16:08.335
- Go right.
- They've seen me indicating left now.

16:08.372 --> 16:10.468
Go left then.

16:10.504 --> 16:13.090
Just take us round the block,
Andy. We'll come at it again.

16:21.599 --> 16:24.149
- Oh, fuck!
- What is it?

16:24.185 --> 16:26.063
- Lights have gone red.
- Where are the jeeps?

16:26.064 --> 16:27.940
- We're right behind them.
- What?!

16:27.976 --> 16:30.526
- Are they staying in the vehicle?
- So far.

16:34.572 --> 16:37.408
Alistair, this has got to be a no-goer.

16:37.445 --> 16:38.998
Let's get out of here.

16:39.035 --> 16:41.543
- Aye, do you want to get out of here?
- No, don't! No!

16:41.579 --> 16:44.359
Sammy'll think we've chickened.
Are they doing anything?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.750
They're just sitting there.

16:50.881 --> 16:52.508
Oh, fuck, Alistair!

16:52.544 --> 16:54.426
Stay down!

17:03.770 --> 17:05.605
We're off!

17:17.785 --> 17:20.542
"You play golf?

17:20.579 --> 17:24.375
- "Did you watch me play?"
- Joe !

17:24.412 --> 17:29.047
"I didn't do too badly. !"

17:31.300 --> 17:35.888
"Oh! I've scored already! Could
be a very short show! Right."

17:35.924 --> 17:37.783
...123, 124...

17:37.819 --> 17:39.315
- Joe?...
- 125...

17:39.351 --> 17:40.773
Come on, son.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.229
I'm almost setting a record! 128,

17:43.266 --> 17:44.736
129, 130,

17:44.773 --> 17:48.307
131, 132, 133, 134,

17:48.308 --> 17:51.655
135, 136, 137...

18:56.266 --> 18:58.394
I've scored. Go! Go!

19:46.654 --> 19:48.072
Let's go.

19:56.665 --> 20:00.794
Hi, Alistair. Enjoy the
evening. Behave yourselves!

20:04.799 --> 20:10.597
# And the party turned insane

20:10.633 --> 20:16.358
# She called out
her na-a-a-ame

20:16.395 --> 20:19.862
# And then she walked
in looking like dynamite

20:19.898 --> 20:24.070
# She said, "Now come along
boogaloo through the night"

20:24.106 --> 20:27.412
# And the way she's
moving well Dyna-Mite

20:27.448 --> 20:30.785
# Light you up with all she's got...
# Want a drink, Skittle?

20:30.822 --> 20:33.785
#...She's got the whole
town lighting up dynamite

20:33.822 --> 20:36.750
# Nobody quite knowing
what to do wrong or right

20:36.786 --> 20:40.129
# But they all know Dyna is dynamite

20:40.165 --> 20:41.505
# And they're right... #

21:12.747 --> 21:15.667
- No! You stop it, Mummy!
- Why didn't you do something?!

21:15.704 --> 21:17.791
You didn't do anything!

21:17.828 --> 21:19.843
Stop it, Mummy! Stop it!

21:19.880 --> 21:23.425
You could have stopped him
with a milk bottle or something!

21:24.009 --> 21:27.054
Please, Mummy! Stop it,
Mummy, please! Please!

21:27.091 --> 21:30.516
Why didn't you? You killed him!

21:30.553 --> 21:33.728
You killed him! NO! Ssh!

21:33.765 --> 21:36.687
NO! NO!

21:36.723 --> 21:39.610
...NO!

21:49.120 --> 21:51.920
"Never knew why that
picture of a cat was there,

21:51.956 --> 21:56.378
"and the other one. Don't
know what happened to that one.

21:56.414 --> 21:58.672
"I mean...?"
What the fuck?

22:00.549 --> 22:03.114
- Sorry, what did you say?
- What?

22:03.151 --> 22:05.679
Did you not just say something?

22:05.716 --> 22:07.603
Was I talking to myself?

22:07.640 --> 22:11.060
It gets me a good seat. I've had
no-one sitting next to me for years.

22:14.522 --> 22:17.046
One on one. For fuck's sake.

22:17.082 --> 22:19.569
I mean, for fuck's sake.

22:22.781 --> 22:26.499
- Would you turn back?
- Are you wanting me to turn back?

22:26.535 --> 22:30.420
- I'd love you for it.
- I think I should get you there first, don't you?

22:30.456 --> 22:33.169
I can take you back
when I've got there.

22:33.171 --> 22:36.004
I'd rather eat my two fucking feet
than you get me there.

22:54.023 --> 22:56.151
Jesus, I mean...

23:03.367 --> 23:06.245
Do you want me to call
them? I can call them.

23:08.247 --> 23:11.834
No, you go on. You do your job.

23:12.079 --> 23:15.385
They said to get you there.

23:15.421 --> 23:16.902
And what? And what?

23:16.903 --> 23:21.261
Well, I know you have to get me there,
that's why you're driving me there.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.311
I mean did you say you
wouldn't get me there?

23:24.348 --> 23:27.261
You mean they mean I
wouldn't get you there,

23:27.262 --> 23:29.562
that's why you have to
get me there? Is that it?

23:29.598 --> 23:31.147
It's something like that.

23:32.398 --> 23:36.408
No, you drive, you do your job.

23:36.444 --> 23:39.995
- Do you mind?
- I don't want you getting in trouble.

23:40.031 --> 23:43.952
I mean, Jesus, I'm in trouble, I can't have
you in trouble, then we'll never get back.

24:01.763 --> 24:06.643
So that last one you did, Alistair,
the Kazakhs, sorry, no, the Cossacks...

24:06.680 --> 24:10.665
- Kosovans.Aye, Albanian and Serb they are.
- Kosovans.

24:10.702 --> 24:14.652
- Aye, that's the one!
- That worked out quite nicely.

24:14.689 --> 24:17.673
So, did they show it in the end then?

24:17.710 --> 24:20.622
They did, about six months ago now.

24:20.659 --> 24:24.951
- I was looking out for it.
- Actually, I didn't see it myself.

24:24.952 --> 24:27.541
I was in South Africa at the time.

24:28.829 --> 24:31.504
"Swanning around the world
talking about your feelings.

24:31.540 --> 24:33.339
"A ticket to paradise."

24:38.720 --> 24:42.980
For killing a man! I mean, where
would he have been without me?

24:43.016 --> 24:48.856
40 years in the factory in Lurgan making egg
cartons like the rest of us. Aye, not him!

24:48.892 --> 24:52.823
He can make a living telling the Pope
and the Queen, the Dalai fucking Lama

24:52.860 --> 24:57.240
how it feels to kill a man. How it feels,
the suffering I have, the burden I carry.

24:58.866 --> 25:01.833
"Why should you get women in
pastel shades and rosy perfumes

25:01.870 --> 25:04.386
"giving you tea and buns
and wine from fucking Chile,

25:04.387 --> 25:06.296
"just so's you can tell them how it feels

25:06.333 --> 25:08.944
"to be putting three bullets
into my brother's head?

25:08.945 --> 25:11.505
"12 years for armed robbery,
membership and murder."

25:15.426 --> 25:17.642
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ!

25:17.678 --> 25:19.915
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

25:19.952 --> 25:22.809
- You made me jump!
- What do you think it does to me?

25:22.845 --> 25:26.188
I'm one fuck of a lot
closer to me than you are!

25:35.010 --> 25:37.929
So is this another one of your
counselling things, Alistair?

25:38.951 --> 25:42.168
No. Well, kind of.

25:42.205 --> 25:44.583
It's a programme about reconciliation.

25:44.619 --> 25:47.174
My own, in fact. It's my own.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.714
I'm to meet the brother
of the man I killed.

25:54.885 --> 25:56.971
- Is that where we're going now?
- Aye.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.852
- Have you not met him yet?
-  No.

26:02.889 --> 26:05.068
No, not since the day.

26:05.835 --> 26:07.988
Well, did you ask for this?

26:08.025 --> 26:11.408
That was never going to be my call, Ray.

26:11.445 --> 26:14.031
I don't have the right
to ask anything from him.

26:14.693 --> 26:17.248
So did he call you or...?

26:17.285 --> 26:20.329
No, the programme people,
they approached him.

26:20.366 --> 26:22.754
Then me.

26:22.790 --> 26:26.717
I said I'd be I'd be
willing t-to, you know.

26:26.753 --> 26:31.133
If it's a meeting he wants I'd be
willing t-t-to do it, to see him.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.136
I'd do anything to...

26:36.889 --> 26:38.391
You know, to...

26:42.437 --> 26:45.028
- Did you do time for it, Alistair?
- Aye.

26:45.065 --> 26:48.026
There was no release
date but I did 12 years.

26:56.285 --> 26:58.975
You could have stopped him!

26:59.012 --> 27:01.666
Why didn't you stop him?!

27:02.917 --> 27:05.336
You could have stopped him!

27:21.437 --> 27:23.314
Can you stop the car?

27:50.719 --> 27:52.304
Can I get you anything?

27:54.389 --> 27:56.266
You want some water?

28:18.666 --> 28:21.857
"He was only a wee boy
at the time, you know."

28:21.893 --> 28:25.048
And is it just the
brother you're meeting?

28:25.084 --> 28:27.276
Aye.

28:27.312 --> 28:29.350
Aye...

28:29.387 --> 28:31.388
It's...

28:32.472 --> 28:34.975
His father died eight months later.

28:35.011 --> 28:37.191
A heart attack.

28:37.227 --> 28:40.695
A broken heart, the family said.

28:40.731 --> 28:45.653
His brother, Daniel, it
was an overdose with him.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.488
After that, his mother, she died.

28:54.663 --> 28:56.629
It's what happens.

28:56.665 --> 28:58.584
It's often what happens.

29:03.047 --> 29:04.632
To the family, you know.

29:09.429 --> 29:13.308
It's the part people don't
understand, don't realise.

29:15.519 --> 29:17.229
What happens after.

29:19.023 --> 29:22.073
"Paddy Barnes

29:22.109 --> 29:24.362
"with a bronze medal
in the Olympic Games

29:24.398 --> 29:26.286
"after losing in his semifinal bout

29:26.322 --> 29:28.992
"against Chinese world
champion, Zou Shiming.

29:29.028 --> 29:32.078
"The defeat was
comprehensive, by 15-0."

29:42.047 --> 29:43.987
You OK?

29:44.023 --> 29:45.927
Carry on?

29:47.720 --> 29:49.931
Aye.

30:09.786 --> 30:11.454
Is it good pay you get?

30:11.491 --> 30:13.039
It's not bad.

30:15.166 --> 30:18.712
- Are you thinking of it?
- Aye, why not?

30:18.748 --> 30:20.297
It looks comfy.

30:25.469 --> 30:27.179
Would I need a driving licence?

30:28.973 --> 30:32.101
There's always a snag somewhere, eh?

30:40.569 --> 30:43.989
"She's been staring at me for
33 years, do you know that?

30:44.026 --> 30:46.706
"What it's like?

30:46.742 --> 30:49.667
"Your mother blaming you for 33 years?

30:49.704 --> 30:52.916
"Three bullets went into his
head. You'd know that, though.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.091
"Did you know another one hit
a picture of a cat on the wall?

30:56.127 --> 30:59.386
"It wasn't me who broke that picture,
I never got the blame for that one,

30:59.423 --> 31:01.483
"and if it wasn't me who
broke the picture on the wall,

31:01.484 --> 31:03.552
"it wasn't me who killed my brother.

31:04.006 --> 31:07.160
"I didn't kill him like
she said I did. It was you.

"It was you in the car

31:10.364 --> 31:12.379
"and shooting three
bullets into her son's head,

did, blaming me the way she did.

the car now, visiting you.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.215
"I'm the one in the car now."

31:22.251 --> 31:24.491
I'm the one in the car now.

31:30.206 --> 31:33.793
- Is this it?
- This is it.

31:39.090 --> 31:40.931
Yes, it's Paul here.

31:40.968 --> 31:43.470
We're just coming in now.

31:43.507 --> 31:45.431
...Yes, he is.

31:45.467 --> 31:48.022
Right.

31:48.059 --> 31:50.770
Jesus, will you look at this place?

32:10.666 --> 32:14.003
Joe, hi! How are you?

32:14.040 --> 32:16.052
Aye, good! Good.

32:16.089 --> 32:19.843
- You've made good time, well done!
- I was just sitting in the back.

32:19.879 --> 32:23.138
- This is David, Michael's assistant.
- Pleased to meet you.

32:23.175 --> 32:27.309
- Hi.
- Come on inside and we'll find Michael.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.691
It'll be grand.

32:28.727 --> 32:31.188
Michael is this way, Mr Griffin.

32:38.196 --> 32:40.329
Mr Griffin is stepping into the house.

32:40.365 --> 32:44.995
It's an interesting staircase. You sort of
expect Bette Davis to come sweeping down it.

32:45.032 --> 32:46.460
I could move in here.

32:46.497 --> 32:51.001
It's yours for one day, at any rate. We've
set up a room for you upstairs to relax in.

32:51.038 --> 32:52.628
- Come in and meet the crew.
- Aye.

32:56.215 --> 32:58.557
Joe, you know Stephanie, don't you?

32:58.593 --> 33:01.721
They didn't tell me you'd
arrived. It's good to see you.

33:01.758 --> 33:04.897
- Aye, you too.
- John, video technician.

33:04.933 --> 33:08.526
- Pleased to meet you.
- Martin, camera.

33:08.562 --> 33:09.901
"Well, here you are, pal.

33:09.902 --> 33:13.651
"A fully signed up member of the
celebrity circuit of Life's Victims.

33:13.687 --> 33:17.840
"Men in love with donkeys, twins
stuck together by their bollocks,

33:17.876 --> 33:21.993
"elephant women who can't get
out of their chairs, and now you."

33:23.537 --> 33:25.372
I know, it's all a bit, you know...

33:25.408 --> 33:27.212
But they're all lovely people,

33:27.249 --> 33:30.419
and they're very experienced
at this sort of thing.

33:30.456 --> 33:32.838
- Fiona'll take you upstairs.
- Yeah.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.423
OK, this way.

33:41.723 --> 33:44.398
So, did you get that poor
old toaster sorted out?

33:44.434 --> 33:48.021
When we last spoke on the phone,
were you not sorting out a toaster?

33:48.058 --> 33:49.648
Oh, aye.

33:53.653 --> 33:56.369
Here we are.

33:56.405 --> 33:58.408
Isn't it gorgeous?

33:59.617 --> 34:02.224
- Can I smoke?
- Um...yeah.

34:02.261 --> 34:04.795
Over there on the balcony.

34:04.831 --> 34:08.085
- Now, what can I get you? Tea or coffee?
- Tea would be nice, aye.

34:08.121 --> 34:09.632
Yeah? Milk, sugar?

34:09.670 --> 34:12.214
- Aye, milk, two sugars. Thank you.
- No problem.

34:22.809 --> 34:25.395
Joe...

34:27.063 --> 34:31.907
- How are you?
- Yeah, good. Aye, I'm good.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.655
- Thank you so much for coming.
- That's OK, aye.

34:34.692 --> 34:37.366
- How are you feeling?
- Aye, I'm OK. I'm OK, aye.

34:37.402 --> 34:39.206
- Everybody looking after you?
- Aye.

34:39.243 --> 34:44.212
Good. I know it's going to
be a difficult day for you.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.460
But we will do everything we
can to make sure it's, you know,

34:47.496 --> 34:49.092
it goes the way you want it to.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.804
So, if there's anything
you need, any questions,

34:51.840 --> 34:55.094
anything you're worried about,
you just stop us and, well,

34:55.130 --> 34:56.759
basically, we're here for you.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.353
- OK.
- So it's very important

34:58.389 --> 35:01.231
that you let us know if
things aren't feeling right.

35:01.267 --> 35:05.272
Now, has Fiona taken you through
the format and so forth? Aye.

35:05.308 --> 35:06.737
OK, good.

35:06.773 --> 35:11.028
Just to briefly put you in the picture
on how the day is going to pan out...

35:11.064 --> 35:14.949
Now, you've got time to settle down
here and make yourself comfortable.

35:14.985 --> 35:17.957
Will you have someone in the bed for me?

35:17.994 --> 35:24.209
Then, at some point, a make-up girl
will come in just to put a little,

35:24.349 --> 35:25.278
you know, on your face.

35:25.314 --> 35:27.796
Sometimes the camera
can make the skin shine.

35:27.832 --> 35:29.636
So, she only needs a few minutes.

35:29.673 --> 35:33.552
Then, when you're ready,
we'll do a little shooting...

35:33.589 --> 35:35.643
filming, up here.

35:35.679 --> 35:38.980
And then, at around 12, you
know, when it feels right,

35:39.016 --> 35:42.729
we can go downstairs and...
you've seen the room, haven't you?

35:42.765 --> 35:45.445
- Aye.
- OK, good.

35:45.482 --> 35:50.534
So, in terms of your
actual meeting with him,

35:50.570 --> 35:54.288
it's important to remember,
for all of us to remember,

35:54.325 --> 35:57.745
where we are trying to get
to in this programme... the truth.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.585
"Yes, I know, I know what you want.

35:59.622 --> 36:02.464
"Shake his fucking hand
and we can all go home."

36:02.500 --> 36:04.785
The last thing I want
to do is push you into...

36:04.786 --> 36:07.172
areas of your mind where
you don't want to go.

36:07.208 --> 36:11.301
But it's important for us to
understand all the emotions in this.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.142
Do you understand what I'm saying?

36:13.178 --> 36:16.473
- Aye. Aye, I understand.
- I know it's difficult.

36:16.510 --> 36:19.398
Which is why I don't want to push that,

36:19.435 --> 36:22.980
but I do want you to be
truthful with how you feel.

36:23.017 --> 36:26.526
What I'm saying really is,
I just want you to be you.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.118
- Michael?
- Yeah.

36:30.155 --> 36:31.823
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

36:33.951 --> 36:38.497
And you know, we are all going
to have an important day here.

36:38.534 --> 36:40.338
I can't tell you how important

36:40.374 --> 36:43.169
I think this is going
to be in terms of...

36:43.205 --> 36:45.927
well, in terms of what it's going to do.

36:45.964 --> 36:48.842
This is the question we are
all wanting the answer to.

36:48.878 --> 36:52.304
Truth and reconciliation.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.073
What's at stake?

36:54.110 --> 36:55.808
Is it possible?

36:57.977 --> 37:01.397
That's it. Speech over.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.780
"I can do handshakes,
Michael! And I can do victim.

37:08.816 --> 37:12.117
"I can do handshake and
victim both at the same time.

37:12.153 --> 37:14.912
"But I've made a decision on this one.

37:14.948 --> 37:17.453
"Reconciliation?

37:17.489 --> 37:19.959
"You have no idea.

37:19.995 --> 37:21.507
"A handshake?

37:21.544 --> 37:25.757
"For killing my brother?
For me taking the blame?

37:25.793 --> 37:27.889
33 years of that?

37:27.926 --> 37:30.475
What do you think I am, a joke?

37:30.512 --> 37:35.726
"If ever a man deserved a knife run
through him, that scum of the earth.

37:42.358 --> 37:43.943
"Truth and reconciliation?"

37:46.070 --> 37:47.739
"I'm going for revenge."

37:56.582 --> 38:01.962
- Oh, hi. I'm Vika.
- Joe. How are you doing?

38:01.999 --> 38:04.253
- Your tea.
- Oh, aye. Thanks.

38:04.290 --> 38:06.926
- I'm the runner.
- The runner?

38:07.343 --> 38:09.471
Do you mind if I have a smoke out there?

38:11.139 --> 38:12.604
Oh, no, no, no...

38:12.641 --> 38:14.976
No, no, of course you
can! Come on, come on.

38:17.271 --> 38:19.857
- Here, have one of mine.
- It's OK, I...

38:19.893 --> 38:22.401
- No, Jesus, come on!
- Thank you.

38:26.656 --> 38:28.241
Here.

38:33.663 --> 38:35.128
Thank you.

38:35.165 --> 38:39.258
- You stay out here with me.
- Thanks, but I...

38:39.294 --> 38:42.256
I'm the star of the show.
You have to do what I say!

38:42.292 --> 38:45.181
- I've come to look after you anyway, so...
- That's great!

38:45.217 --> 38:50.557
Everyone's looking after me! They're
even worrying about my toaster.

38:52.267 --> 38:57.189
- You're a what? A runner?
- Yeah, it means I run around and and
makes what must be made.

38:57.225 --> 38:59.238
- A dogsbody, then!
- A dogsbody?

38:59.274 --> 39:02.152
No, no! Runner's better
I like runner.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.633
Young Fiona here visited me
out of the blue one morning,

39:22.669 --> 39:25.975
said she was a researcher on
a programme called One On One.

39:26.012 --> 39:29.515
She was all posh and lovely, her
voice is all up here and down there

39:29.552 --> 39:31.890
and the weather's
always doing something,

39:31.926 --> 39:34.192
and every time she
turns, she smiles at me.

39:34.229 --> 39:37.941
Would she smile at me if she didn't know
me and I sat down next to her in the pub?

39:37.978 --> 39:39.156
She'd call the police.

39:39.192 --> 39:43.911
Ah! Fuck, I would! So, anyway,

39:43.948 --> 39:46.158
And now look what I've got myself into.

39:51.456 --> 39:55.961
- Maybe it's a good thing you are here.
- Aye. Maybe it is.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.467
Where are you from?

40:01.503 --> 40:02.973
Vladivostok.

40:03.010 --> 40:07.348
Vladivostok AND Belfast? Does
bad luck run in your family?

40:07.384 --> 40:09.272
I like it here.

40:09.308 --> 40:11.399
I like you here too. I like you!

40:11.957 --> 40:14.251
So, she was sitting in
my kitchen, she says,

40:14.288 --> 40:15.403
this is an important programme

40:15.440 --> 40:17.964
about men who have become
the man they have become,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.451
that you have become,
or some fuck-knows thing.

40:20.487 --> 40:23.177
Then she said it's more about
the man you could become.

40:23.214 --> 40:25.868
"That's what excites us all
about this project," she said.

40:25.904 --> 40:28.209
She had the light in her
eyes, the missionary light.

40:28.245 --> 40:31.186
"It's about healing", she said.
"It's about reconciliation."

40:31.223 --> 40:34.127
"What is that?" I said. "People
coming out of their graves?"

40:34.163 --> 40:36.426
"No", she said, smiling.
"That's resurrection."

40:36.463 --> 40:39.466
We want you to meet the man who
killed your brother, face to face.

40:43.762 --> 40:48.601
I don't know. The thing is, it isn't
the way she was looking and talking,

40:48.637 --> 40:52.021
and I wasn't really listening
to anything she was telling me.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.696
It's just that...

40:54.732 --> 40:57.068
she showed me a little kindness.

40:59.905 --> 41:02.491
- Well, I'm sure...
- But I don't do kindness.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.077
I fucking hate kindness.
I don't let that in.

41:05.113 --> 41:06.829
I let it in then, but never again.

41:13.586 --> 41:17.966
The trouble with me is, I've
got all the wrong feelings.

41:20.302 --> 41:21.871
But him! Oh, his feelings!

41:21.908 --> 41:23.811
They are just right, just perfect!

41:23.847 --> 41:26.981
He did it in cold blood, but now
look at the man he has become!

41:27.017 --> 41:31.147
"What is it like to kill a man," they all
ask him? "Well, you have to understand..."

41:31.183 --> 41:33.983
And off he goes again, telling
them all about this and that.

41:34.020 --> 41:36.074
But hats off to him, he's cracked it!

41:36.110 --> 41:39.698
He knows they all love to
shake hands with a killer.

41:41.408 --> 41:42.701
- Is there someone with him?
- Oh, yes.Yes.

41:42.702 --> 41:45.287
That's important, you know?

41:45.324 --> 41:47.891
Whatever he tells you
he's feeling about this,

41:47.927 --> 41:50.423
he's going to be very
angry. I mean, very angry.

41:50.459 --> 41:53.275
- That anger could go in any direction.
- I understand that.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.090
You have to be prepared to
stop the filming at any moment.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.931
- We're not performing monkeys.
- No.

41:58.906 --> 42:00.058
I realise you have a programme to make

42:00.095 --> 42:02.311
but what's happening to
him has to come first.

42:02.347 --> 42:05.606
- Yes, absolutely.
- You have to make sure
he doesn't come to any harm.

42:05.642 --> 42:09.639
"Listen to him", they will say,
"and there is hope in the world!"

42:09.640 --> 42:10.856
"And you know what he's thinking?

42:10.893 --> 42:15.236
"Do this gig well here and I've got another
20 years of pay cheques in front of me.

42:15.273 --> 42:18.490
"I can talk about that day then and
this day now for the next 20 years,

42:18.526 --> 42:20.914
"how I came face to face
with the brother of my victim,

42:20.951 --> 42:24.705
"and how it was the final act in my
journey towards a magnificent redemption,

42:24.741 --> 42:27.504
"and how listening to me is the
way forward in life, plus VAT.

42:27.541 --> 42:31.504
"And with their cheques in my pocket, I
will talk unto the wretched of the world

42:31.540 --> 42:33.636
"and I will heal them with my words,

42:33.673 --> 42:36.759
"I won't have to work in a fucking
egg carton factory ever again."

42:36.796 --> 42:39.184
So!

42:39.220 --> 42:41.770
The man shot my brother
three times in the head.

42:41.806 --> 42:44.643
The man is having the life
of Riley. What should I do?

42:44.679 --> 42:47.062
Do I shake his hand or do I kill him?

42:52.943 --> 42:55.284
Well, killing him
wouldn't be good for him.

42:55.321 --> 42:59.909
- For sure of that!
- But it wouldn't be good for you either.

42:59.946 --> 43:01.995
Oh, not good for me?

43:05.499 --> 43:08.591
My five minutes of heaven!

43:08.627 --> 43:11.046
How would that be not good for me?

43:13.549 --> 43:16.057
- Joe, hi! Everything OK?
- Aye. OK, aye.

43:16.093 --> 43:20.348
They're just doing a wee bit of filming
downstairs and then we're set to go, OK?

43:20.385 --> 43:23.351
Can Cathy come in and do a wee bit
of make-up just to get you ready?

43:23.388 --> 43:25.025
- Aye. OK, aye.
- Hi, Joe.

43:25.061 --> 43:27.230
I'm Cathy. How are you, all right?

43:27.267 --> 43:29.405
- Good, aye. I'm good.
- Lovely!

43:29.441 --> 43:31.276
I just want to sit you down here.

43:32.528 --> 43:34.822
There we go.

43:35.907 --> 43:37.825
That's lovely.

43:39.327 --> 43:42.080
Now, this is just to take
the shine off your skin.

43:42.116 --> 43:43.503
Fuck, am I shining?

43:43.540 --> 43:47.794
OK, Alistair, the camera's
running, so just in your own time.

43:52.925 --> 43:55.850
In order for me...

43:55.886 --> 43:58.559
In order for me to talk
about the man I have become,

43:58.560 --> 44:00.475
you need to know about the man I was.

44:00.511 --> 44:03.233
I was 14 when I joined the Tartan Gangs

44:03.269 --> 44:07.774
and I was 15 when I joined the
UVF, the Ulster Volunteer Force.

44:09.610 --> 44:11.862
The situation at that time, you know...

44:13.280 --> 44:16.659
Cut there. Sorry, that's very good
but we're picking up some noise.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.244
That's really good.

44:19.620 --> 44:23.296
OK? OK, we're good to go again.

44:23.333 --> 44:28.463
- Running up.
- And in your own time, Alistair.

44:34.595 --> 44:40.351
For me to talk about the man I have become,
you need to know about the man I was.

44:40.388 --> 44:42.687
I was 14 when I joined the Tartan Gangs

44:42.723 --> 44:46.279
and I was 15 when I joined the UVF.

44:46.316 --> 44:50.737
At that time, don't forget, there
were riots on the streets every week,

44:50.774 --> 44:52.286
petrol bombs every day.

44:52.322 --> 44:54.038
And that was just in our town.

44:54.074 --> 44:56.249
When you got home and
switched on the TV,

44:56.285 --> 44:59.413
you could see it was happening
in every other town as well,

44:59.450 --> 45:01.796
and it was like we were under siege.

45:01.833 --> 45:05.795
Fathers and brothers of friends
were being killed in the streets

45:05.832 --> 45:08.637
and the feeling was, we
all have to do something.

45:08.673 --> 45:12.845
We're all in this together and
we all have to do something.

45:12.881 --> 45:15.728
The thing you have to remember,

45:15.764 --> 45:18.940
what you have to
understand, is the mindset.

45:18.976 --> 45:24.107
Once you have signed up to terror
and joined the organisation,

45:24.143 --> 45:26.919
the group, your mind closes right down.

45:26.956 --> 45:29.696
It becomes only our story that matters.

45:29.733 --> 45:32.371
Not their story, the Catholics.

45:32.407 --> 45:35.828
It's only my people that are
being killed and who are suffering

45:35.864 --> 45:37.376
and who need looking after.

45:37.413 --> 45:40.088
Catholics being killed
doesn't enter your head.

45:40.124 --> 45:45.213
And so when I went up to
Sammy, our local commander,

45:45.249 --> 45:48.216
and told him I wanted
to kill a Catholic man,

45:48.253 --> 45:50.682
it wasn't a wrong thing for me to do.

45:50.719 --> 45:56.141
In my head, it was the proper, the
just, the fair, the good thing to do.

45:56.178 --> 45:57.726
And so it was easy.

45:59.478 --> 46:02.940
When I got to the house,
there was a boy in the street.

46:02.977 --> 46:07.450
I didn't expect him to be
there, but there he was.

46:07.487 --> 46:10.407
I only looked at him for a
moment because I had a job to do.

46:10.443 --> 46:13.785
But if I had known that
he was Jim's brother,

46:13.822 --> 46:16.080
I would have shot him as well.

46:16.116 --> 46:18.337
It was in the mindset.

46:18.374 --> 46:21.836
It was tit for tat and
perhaps one more, why not?

46:24.255 --> 46:26.591
That's what it was like.

46:26.627 --> 46:28.426
I was only 17.

46:29.511 --> 46:33.098
I had seen my people fighting
ever since I was a wee boy.

46:33.134 --> 46:35.773
You take sides with
your friends as a boy,

46:35.809 --> 46:38.604
but we weren't just throwing
stones over the fence -

46:38.640 --> 46:40.519
we were shooting guns.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.658
What I want to tell people,
what society must do,

46:45.695 --> 46:49.324
is to stop people getting to the
point where they join the group.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.999
Because when you get to
that point, it's too late.

46:52.035 --> 46:55.664
No-one's going to stop you.
No-one's going to change your mind.

46:55.700 --> 46:58.798
And once you're in,
you will do anything.

46:58.834 --> 47:03.881
You will kill anyone on the other
side because it's right to do it.

47:03.918 --> 47:07.802
Once your man has joined the
group, society has lost him.

47:07.839 --> 47:09.684
And what he needs to hear

47:09.721 --> 47:14.226
are voices on his own side
stopping him before he goes in.

47:15.477 --> 47:19.773
There were no voices on my
side. Not on my side of the town.

47:19.810 --> 47:22.323
Not on my estate.

47:22.359 --> 47:26.531
No-one was telling me anything
other than that killing is right.

47:26.567 --> 47:30.457
It was only in prison when
I heard that other voice.

47:30.493 --> 47:34.414
And the Muslims now, you know,
the kids now are like I was then.

47:34.451 --> 47:36.255
They need to hear those voices now,

47:36.291 --> 47:39.169
stopping them from thinking
that killing is good.

47:39.206 --> 47:41.210
They need their own people to say no.

47:41.247 --> 47:43.149
That's where they need to hear it.

47:43.185 --> 47:45.014
That's where I would put my money,

47:45.051 --> 47:48.346
on making those voices heard
in every mosque in the country.

47:52.642 --> 47:55.937
When I got home, my mother
and father were watching the TV

47:55.974 --> 47:59.233
and it came on the news that
the man I had shot was dead.

47:59.269 --> 48:01.878
I was so excited that I couldn't wait

48:01.915 --> 48:04.620
for when I would get my congratulations.

48:04.656 --> 48:07.262
Sammy was going to come
knocking at my door.

48:07.299 --> 48:09.869
He was going to lead
me out into the street

48:09.906 --> 48:12.878
and proudly walk me into the bar

48:12.914 --> 48:17.502
and everybody was going
to stand up and applaud me.

48:17.539 --> 48:19.379
I would have shot anyone for that.

48:20.422 --> 48:24.009
And that is why I talk to
anybody who will listen now,

48:24.046 --> 48:26.559
to tell them to stop
boys like me thinking

48:26.596 --> 48:30.934
that to shoot an innocent and a
decent man in the head is a good thing.

48:39.109 --> 48:44.907
Alistair, when he comes into the
room, what are you hoping for?

48:45.991 --> 48:49.667
Well, what I have to do
is to be honest with him.

48:49.704 --> 48:53.833
That is the most difficult thing, but
that's what he's going to need from me,

48:53.870 --> 48:55.835
is to be honest with him.

48:58.213 --> 49:00.027
Cut.

49:00.064 --> 49:01.842
Good.

49:03.052 --> 49:05.304
Fantastic.

49:12.228 --> 49:14.694
Thank you. That was perfect. Yeah.

49:14.731 --> 49:19.257
Once he's in the room
with you, do you think...?

49:19.293 --> 49:23.782
I mean, is it likely he'll
want an apology from you?

49:23.819 --> 49:25.790
Michael, Michael...

49:25.826 --> 49:30.206
He doesn't want to hear me say I'm
sorry or to ask for forgiveness.

49:30.242 --> 49:32.250
Reconciliation is not on the agenda.

49:32.286 --> 49:33.715
That's not what he needs.

49:33.751 --> 49:37.380
He has come here and I have
come here so he can confront me.

50:20.927 --> 50:23.310
- Hiya, Joe.
- Ah, here he is.

50:23.347 --> 50:26.684
I wondered if I could sort you
out with a wee radio mike here?

50:26.720 --> 50:29.350
- Where are you putting that?
- How are we doing? Ready to go?

50:29.387 --> 50:31.981
- I just need to clip this on here.
- I don't like that side.

50:32.017 --> 50:33.613
- How are you feeling?
- Aye, OK.

50:33.649 --> 50:37.529
What about if I put it
in here? Is that better?

50:37.565 --> 50:39.286
- Thank you.
- You sure?

50:39.322 --> 50:41.908
- Aye, OK.
- Just need to clip this on here.

50:43.952 --> 50:48.254
- All right, that's it.
- OK. Good.

50:48.290 --> 50:51.794
What we're gonna do now, we are
going to bring you downstairs.

50:51.831 --> 50:55.298
Now, the cameraman will be filming
you but don't look at him...

51:00.548 --> 51:02.615
...Joe?

51:02.652 --> 51:04.646
Yeah, Joe?

51:04.683 --> 51:06.148
Going downstairs, aye.

51:06.185 --> 51:09.918
Now, when you open the
door and go into the room,

51:09.954 --> 51:13.651
make sure you open the
door wide and leave it open.

51:13.687 --> 51:15.283
- OK?
- Aye.

51:15.319 --> 51:19.240
What the cameraman will be doing,
he'll be following you into the room,

51:19.277 --> 51:22.327
and somebody else'll be
closing the door behind him, OK?

51:22.364 --> 51:24.710
- Aye.
- Clear?

51:24.746 --> 51:28.584
- Sure?
- Aye, I'm sure.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.560
OK, here you are.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.824
OK, we're ready...OK.

51:52.860 --> 51:54.487
"Quiet please! Running up.

52:01.411 --> 52:03.580
"Joe, whenever you're ready."

52:57.805 --> 52:59.538
- Shit! Cut!
- What?

52:59.539 --> 53:01.272
Sorry, I nearly fell there.

53:01.309 --> 53:05.397
Sorry, Joe. These things happen. I'm
afraid we really do need that shot.

53:05.433 --> 53:07.566
Would you mind just doing that again -

53:07.602 --> 53:10.890
the walk down the stairs
and then go to the room.

53:10.891 --> 53:11.987
Aye, OK.

53:12.024 --> 53:13.864
Sorry, Joe. Thank you.

53:18.452 --> 53:22.081
OK, guys, let's rehearse our
moves until we get it right.

53:22.118 --> 53:23.583
Then we'll go again.

53:30.090 --> 53:32.634
Can I get a drink of water, please?

53:32.671 --> 53:34.178
...Oh, yeah.

53:44.147 --> 53:45.982
Stay with him.

54:05.462 --> 54:07.839
So, you're still looking
after me, are you?

54:10.926 --> 54:14.680
I just want to say...
I hope it goes well.

54:14.716 --> 54:18.684
- But he seems a nice man.
- Who does?

54:18.721 --> 54:20.394
Mr Little.

54:22.897 --> 54:24.779
- Have you met him?
- Yes.

54:24.816 --> 54:28.325
- Where?
- In Belfast. I went to his home.

54:28.361 --> 54:32.282
- I didn't know that.
- Yes, I was delivering something.

54:32.319 --> 54:34.323
- To his home?
- Yes.

54:34.359 --> 54:36.292
- Did you go in?
- Yes.

54:36.328 --> 54:38.956
- Where was that?
- City centre...

54:38.993 --> 54:40.838
um...

54:40.875 --> 54:43.503
...beside the motorway.
A block of flats.

54:43.539 --> 54:46.094
- It's a flat, then, is it?
- Yes, a flat.

54:46.131 --> 54:50.051
- So, he let you in, did he?
- I didn't stay long, I...

54:50.088 --> 54:51.892
What was it like?

54:51.928 --> 54:53.972
- His flat?
- What was it like?

54:54.009 --> 54:58.102
It was like...cold.

54:58.138 --> 55:00.622
- Empty.
- Empty?

55:00.659 --> 55:02.675
Like not a home.

55:02.712 --> 55:04.692
Not a happy place.

55:06.027 --> 55:07.492
Was it?

55:07.529 --> 55:09.327
I didn't like it.

55:09.364 --> 55:11.830
Is he on his own, then?

55:11.867 --> 55:14.286
- Yes.
- Is he? But you liked him?

55:14.322 --> 55:16.210
Yes.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.165
What did you talk about?

55:18.202 --> 55:20.256
About this.

55:20.292 --> 55:22.508
- This meeting.
- What did he say?

55:22.545 --> 55:25.798
- Well, he was worried about it.
- Oh, I bet he was!

55:25.835 --> 55:28.301
He was worried for you.

55:30.011 --> 55:32.347
- Joe, ready whenever you are.
- OK.

55:33.265 --> 55:34.938
What do you...?

55:34.975 --> 55:37.519
Will you let me finish my ciggie?

55:39.522 --> 55:43.192
Aye, yeah, sure... Fine.

55:44.444 --> 55:47.530
Worried for me? What do you
mean, he was worried for me?

55:47.567 --> 55:50.426
That... He said he thought it
would be too painful for you.

55:50.463 --> 55:53.314
He said that, did he? Too
painful, is that what he said?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.226
- Yes, difficult for you.
- Painful or difficult?

55:55.227 --> 55:56.165
He said both.

55:58.375 --> 55:59.960
Did he?

56:02.964 --> 56:05.508
What about him?
What did he say about himself?

56:05.544 --> 56:07.176
He didn't talk about himself.

56:08.887 --> 56:10.889
But he seems very sad.

56:12.057 --> 56:13.141
Sad?

56:17.396 --> 56:18.861
I don't know, but...

56:18.897 --> 56:22.067
I don't know him really,
but that's how he seemed.

56:24.028 --> 56:27.657
Like he couldn't forgive himself
for what he's done to you.

56:27.693 --> 56:30.160
There's an expression you say, um...

56:31.369 --> 56:33.413
...a broken man.

56:36.959 --> 56:39.044
A broken man.

56:42.339 --> 56:46.385
So, it's good... It's
good that you're meeting.

56:46.422 --> 56:47.720
I think.

56:49.848 --> 56:51.354
Fuck!

56:53.852 --> 56:55.937
Ready when you are, Joe.

56:55.974 --> 56:57.653
OK?

56:57.689 --> 57:00.275
Ready when you are.

57:02.528 --> 57:04.530
Aye.

57:06.574 --> 57:09.243
I need an end to this.

57:14.749 --> 57:16.585
Everything OK?

57:16.621 --> 57:18.634
Joe?

57:18.670 --> 57:21.298
Everything OK?

57:21.335 --> 57:22.596
Aye.

57:22.633 --> 57:23.801
You ready?

57:23.837 --> 57:26.100
Aye.

57:26.137 --> 57:29.640
Joe, just a wee bit more here.

57:29.677 --> 57:31.476
There you go.

57:33.186 --> 57:35.397
Great.

57:52.415 --> 57:54.104
"Quiet, please!

57:54.141 --> 57:55.757
"Running up.

57:55.794 --> 57:57.900
"OK, Joe, ready when you are.

57:57.937 --> 58:00.007
"Joe, whenever you're ready."

59:08.456 --> 59:10.541
Joe?

59:12.293 --> 59:13.842
Are you all right?

59:13.878 --> 59:15.719
Do you want to sit down?

59:15.755 --> 59:18.555
I don't want the camera there.

59:18.592 --> 59:23.055
- I know, it takes some getting used to.
- You'll have to take it away.

59:23.091 --> 59:25.891
- Well, the thing about that...
- The thing is nothing!

59:25.928 --> 59:27.982
Why don't we go and talk this through?

59:28.018 --> 59:32.231
I don't want the camera in my
face when I am meeting that man!

59:32.268 --> 59:34.823
- We did agree...
- I don't care what we agreed to.

59:34.859 --> 59:37.320
I hear what you're saying,
but there must be a camera.

59:37.357 --> 59:39.653
Would you like to speak...

59:39.689 --> 59:41.914
They're going to be setting up,

59:41.950 --> 59:45.084
so why don't we take a few
moments out, go upstairs and...

59:45.120 --> 59:48.499
I've been upstairs to be down the
stairs! I am not a fucking show pony!

59:48.535 --> 59:51.877
I will meet him! I want to meet him!
But I don't want the camera there!

59:51.914 --> 59:54.172
I understand that,
Joe, but what I think...

59:54.208 --> 59:57.217
- Joe, what we can't do is...
- No!

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.598
Joe!

01:00:45.227 --> 01:00:51.275
33 years that boy has been living
in this head, standing there,

01:00:51.311 --> 01:00:57.323
staring at me, looking up
at me, never leaving me.

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:02.501
Never leaving.

01:01:02.537 --> 01:01:05.712
Every morning waiting for me,

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:09.712
and I know he'll be there for always.

01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:20.807
I don't know what to do any more.

01:01:22.684 --> 01:01:24.269
How to deal with this.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.775
I feel I've come to the
end of what I can take.

01:01:37.074 --> 01:01:40.078
"Time will heal, they say."

01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:45.250
What everyone says about everything.

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:46.924
The years just get heavier.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.924
Why don't they tell you
that? Nobody tells you that.

01:02:15.241 --> 01:02:16.706
Can I get you anything?

01:02:16.742 --> 01:02:19.662
Why do YOU think he didn't come in?

01:02:22.123 --> 01:02:23.588
Too frightened?

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:27.546
You think he really wanted to meet me?

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:31.175
I think he wanted to kill you.

01:02:38.975 --> 01:02:42.854
Sorry, I just have to go.

01:04:20.668 --> 01:04:22.628
Guilty if I laugh.

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:24.627
Guilty if I drink.

01:04:24.664 --> 01:04:26.591
Guilty if I forget.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.429
How to get through a day.

01:04:34.057 --> 01:04:36.727
What to do in it.

01:04:38.854 --> 01:04:41.357
I wake up, I go out.

01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:43.985
But where to go?

01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.158
He's always there.

01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:53.161
In my head.

01:04:54.955 --> 01:04:56.790
And I don't know where to go.

01:05:00.836 --> 01:05:02.880
Where to put yourself after it all.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.432
It's the same for everyone.

01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:09.809
"Some of us have found an answer.

01:05:09.846 --> 01:05:12.363
"He's killed a few Catholics

01:05:12.364 --> 01:05:16.228
"in his time and now he's killing his own.

01:05:16.264 --> 01:05:20.237
"Some protection thing
to control the estate.

01:05:20.274 --> 01:05:24.362
"Released after the Good Friday
Agreement, he's on top of the world again,

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:26.781
"still living it, just like he always was,

01:05:26.817 --> 01:05:28.830
"with his mates watching his back,

01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:33.043
"breathing in the scent of his victories.

01:05:33.079 --> 01:05:37.543
"If I had gone with him then,
just said yes to him then...

01:05:37.579 --> 01:05:41.714
"That's all I had to do,
just tell him I was in."

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.881
I know that isn't my answer,

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:47.976
but what is my answer, you know?

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:50.312
"I sit in meeting
rooms all over the world

01:05:50.348 --> 01:05:54.227
"and I help men to live with
what they've done to a wife,

01:05:54.264 --> 01:05:56.693
"a child, a stranger, a neighbour,

01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:59.775
"how to live with that act
of violence that's, you know,

01:05:59.811 --> 01:06:01.151
"always there inside us.

01:06:02.736 --> 01:06:05.495
"But I can't help myself.

01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:08.993
"Sometimes I feel that this
preacher is just the man I've become

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:13.164
"so that I can cheat
my way through my life."

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:27.203
"The next stop is Lurgan."

01:08:18.508 --> 01:08:19.843
Tommy!

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:26.642
Boys.

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:32.607
- How's things?
- Aye, OK.

01:08:32.643 --> 01:08:33.988
Tommy!

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:36.366
It's a surprise to see you in here.

01:08:36.402 --> 01:08:39.113
Would you mind getting
this to Joe Griffin for me?

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:42.993
- How's Tommy?
- OK.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.832
Aye.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.622
- Is he expecting it?
- No.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:52.461
He might not take it, but
I'll make sure it gets to him.

01:08:52.497 --> 01:08:54.671
I would appreciate that.

01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:56.591
Thanks.

01:09:25.831 --> 01:09:29.667
- Black tea, please, love.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:29.280
Hi, Liam.

01:10:29.316 --> 01:10:32.820
- Who's this from?
- Sean.

01:10:32.856 --> 01:10:34.861
What is it?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.866
A letter.

01:10:39.744 --> 01:10:41.996
Can I go now?

01:10:46.752 --> 01:10:48.962
- What did you say?
- Can I go now?

01:10:57.346 --> 01:10:59.015
Are you taking the girls, Joe?

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:02.858
- The girls?
- Marion's.

01:11:02.894 --> 01:11:04.771
- You said you would.
- Marion's.

01:11:04.808 --> 01:11:06.612
Oh, aye. Aye, I'm taking them.

01:11:06.648 --> 01:11:09.740
They're ready now.
They're waiting to go.

01:11:09.776 --> 01:11:13.452
- What is it? What's the matter?
- Little's come back.

01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:16.414
- He's wanting to meet with me.
- You're not going to meet him.

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:18.007
You're not to be calling him!

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:21.497
- I'll be killing him, not calling.
- Maybe he's wanting to end this.

01:11:21.534 --> 01:11:24.810
- I should have had him.
- Why don't I get Sean to deal with it?

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:28.088
You will fucking do nothing!
You're not going to see him!

01:11:28.124 --> 01:11:31.425
Joe! I will have my five minutes! Joe!

01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:34.720
Joe!

01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:31.721
Joe?

01:14:31.494 --> 01:14:32.996
Joe?

01:16:11.519 --> 01:16:13.646
Come on, man!

01:16:19.403 --> 01:16:21.488
Fuck you!

01:16:26.076 --> 01:16:27.682
Enough...

01:16:27.719 --> 01:16:29.288
Enough.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.087
I'm going to Belfast and
I won't be coming back...

01:18:27.124 --> 01:18:31.504
so I'm going to tell you
everything that happened here.

01:18:32.964 --> 01:18:38.595
We were told that a Protestant
worker had been threatened...

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:42.095
and if he didn't leave
the yard, he'd be shot.

01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:45.560
I asked who the Catholics
were working there.

01:18:45.597 --> 01:18:47.943
Somebody said Jim Griffin.

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:52.156
I said, "Tell him if he
doesn't leave, I'll shoot him."

01:18:52.193 --> 01:18:57.740
I knew he was leaving anyway,
but it didn't make a difference.

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:05.832
It was my decision. I was up
for anything, to kill anyone.

01:19:08.627 --> 01:19:12.089
I wanted...to be someone.

01:19:13.674 --> 01:19:17.679
I wanted to... walk into the bar a man.

01:19:17.715 --> 01:19:19.185
Walk in ten foot tall

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:22.892
and hear the applause from the only
people that mattered to me then.

01:19:22.929 --> 01:19:25.312
And I heard it. And it was good.

01:19:28.941 --> 01:19:31.240
Get rid of me, Joe...

01:19:31.277 --> 01:19:33.451
so that when you wake up in the morning,

01:19:33.487 --> 01:19:36.115
it's not me's in your
head, it's your daughters.

01:19:37.158 --> 01:19:39.833
Don't give them me.

01:19:39.869 --> 01:19:42.872
Go home and tell them
that you've killed me off.

01:19:42.909 --> 01:19:45.041
That I'm gone, forever.

01:19:45.078 --> 01:19:46.915
I'm nothing.

01:19:46.952 --> 01:19:48.754
Nothing.

01:19:50.672 --> 01:19:54.260
Go home and tell them that
and live your life for them.

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:18.898
"We did everything together.

01:21:18.935 --> 01:21:23.064
"I don't know what is
was, we just clicked.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.654
"Alan was great.

01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:26.865
"He liked me for who I was.

01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:29.112
"And he didn't care about my problem.

01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:30.947
"Alan had no sense of smell.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:38.956
"Alan was my best friend.

01:21:38.993 --> 01:21:41.292
"Alan was my only friend."

01:21:43.252 --> 01:21:46.297
"But every day was a constant
struggle with my problem.

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:49.801
"And every day, I tried to avoid...

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:51.517
"Damian.

01:21:51.553 --> 01:21:53.138
"Look who it isn't.

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:54.687
"Patrick Smash.

01:21:54.723 --> 01:21:57.685
"What you doing in my corner
of the playground, Smash?

01:21:57.721 --> 01:22:00.730
"You ain't nothing
but a big, fat loser."

01:22:07.529 --> 01:22:11.324
I haven't done this
sort of thing before.

01:22:11.361 --> 01:22:13.160
Or talked, or...

01:22:15.829 --> 01:22:17.414
So...

01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:24.380
I don't know what to
say or how to say it.

01:22:26.424 --> 01:22:31.179
I don't know the words,
the sort of words you use.

01:22:35.768 --> 01:22:38.479
I bought some sandals cos
I'd seen it in a movie.

01:22:38.515 --> 01:22:41.190
They were all sitting in
a circle, wearing sandals.

01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:48.281
Then I remembered it was a comedy.

01:22:55.998 --> 01:23:00.252
But I got here eventually,
got through that door.

01:23:11.473 --> 01:23:17.396
I want my daughters...to have
a dad they could be proud of.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.485
That's it.

01:23:24.612 --> 01:23:26.197
That's it.

01:23:28.366 --> 01:23:31.161
Well, that's it.

01:23:32.913 --> 01:23:34.664
That's out.

01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:38.043
That's out.

01:23:39.933 --> 01:23:41.714
That's out.

01:24:02.862 --> 01:24:05.072
That's out.

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.717
"Alistair Little?" Yeah?

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:25.571
"It's Joe Griffin.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:27.686
"We're finished."
