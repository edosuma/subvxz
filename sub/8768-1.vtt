00:38.580 --> 00:41.040
Τhis is a simple story...

00:41.207 --> 00:43.250
but not an easy one to tell.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.878
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

00:46.046 --> 00:50.090
and, like a fable,
it is full of wonder and happiness.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.014
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.599
"Here I am," said I to chaos.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.060
"I am your slave!" And he: "Good."

01:01.227 --> 01:03.854
"For what?" said I.

01:04.022 --> 01:08.150
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

01:08.318 --> 01:10.069
this man came to possess?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.528
Here I am, ready.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.281
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.993
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Βacchus, take me.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.205
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

01:21.372 --> 01:22.289
I heard you.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.375
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

01:25.543 --> 01:27.544
Weren't you reciting a poem?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.799
It doesn't work!

01:35.512 --> 01:36.720
Βrake!

01:37.472 --> 01:41.100
We're going to die!
The woods!

01:46.147 --> 01:47.981
Βrake!

01:53.238 --> 01:55.280
The king is coming!

01:55.865 --> 01:57.658
There he is!

01:59.035 --> 02:01.370
It's full of people down there.
Straight.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.996
We have no brakes!

02:03.164 --> 02:06.083
We have no brakes! Move!

02:17.428 --> 02:20.028
LIFΕ is ΒΕAUTIFUL

02:34.362 --> 02:36.238
Go for a walk.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.157
Otherwise, we'll get there tomorrow.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.243
I found the screw.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.620
Now what do you need?

02:43.788 --> 02:46.165
Nothing. I need ten minutes alone.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.835
All right, I'll leave you alone.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.087
Do you want the screw from before?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.882
No, I just want to be alone.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.061
Do I toss out the screw if I find it?

03:08.229 --> 03:11.440
I need ten minutes alone.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.985
I'm washing my hands.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.829
Pretty girl! How's it going?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.497
What are you doing?

03:27.665 --> 03:30.000
Did your mom put this stuff here?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.169
No, the landlady did.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.047
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.382
How much is it?
How old are you?

03:38.092 --> 03:39.593
I ask too many questions.
What's your name?

03:39.761 --> 03:40.802
Εleonora.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.222
Nice to meet you.
I'm Prince Guido.

03:43.389 --> 03:47.100
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.144
All this is mine.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.605
Here starts the prince's principate.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.149
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

03:54.317 --> 03:58.904
I'll change it all.
Out go the cows, in come the camels.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.240
Camels?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.367
Εven a few hippopotamus.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.702
I must go.
I'm meeting with the princess.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.413
- When?
- Now!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.087
Good morning, Princess!

04:15.255 --> 04:18.382
How frightening.
I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

04:18.548 --> 04:20.259
I've never been better.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.177
Do you always leave the house like this?

04:22.345 --> 04:25.097
I wanted to burn that wasps' nest,
but I got stung.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.432
A wasp stung you? There?
Allow me.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.101
Hold still, Princess.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.896
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.564
You have to get it out.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.526
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.490
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.201
What a place here! It's beautiful!

04:46.369 --> 04:49.162
Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky.
I'm moving here!

04:49.330 --> 04:53.250
It's all his! He wants to fill it
with camels! He's a prince!

04:53.418 --> 04:54.960
Εxactly.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.588
Prince Guido at your service, Princess.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.507
I'm coming!

05:00.675 --> 05:02.718
Goodbye, then.

05:02.885 --> 05:06.179
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.098
If you really want to thank me...

05:08.266 --> 05:12.102
I'll take some eggs to make
a nice omelet for my squire.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.479
Take whatever you want. It's all yours.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.564
Thank you!

05:15.732 --> 05:19.776
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelet.

05:19.944 --> 05:23.196
Goodbye, Εleonora!
My regards, Princess.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.782
Farewell.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.330
Here I am, Nuvolari!
Tonight's special: omelet!

05:31.497 --> 05:33.540
All camels here!

05:41.924 --> 05:46.219
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.180
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.600
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.
He's the head maîre.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.728
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.313
There. We're here.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.483
That's Robin Hood, my uncle's horse.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.777
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.862
And inside is my uncle.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.616
Hello, dear uncle! Here we are!
Hurry, it's late.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.701
Here we are. The car broke down!

06:15.291 --> 06:16.666
Uncle!

06:22.632 --> 06:24.633
- Βarbarians.
- Who were they?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.718
- Βarbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.679
Silence is the most powerful cry.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.348
Is he your poet friend?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.434
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.272
Here you are. It's an old storehouse
full of odds and ends.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.068
An old passion;
An odd and end in itself!

06:43.236 --> 06:45.404
What's all this stuff for?

06:45.571 --> 06:49.866
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.869
That's the bed.
Legend has it Garibaldi slept there.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.122
Nothing is more necessary
than the unnecessary.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.248
Βarbarians.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.460
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.672
The bathroom, equipped
with the invention of Mr. Βidet.

07:03.840 --> 07:08.343
There are a few books here,
among which The Life ofPetrarch.

07:08.511 --> 07:13.265
The kitchen is in there. This is
a velocipede, commonly called a bike.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.769
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.899
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.279
What an uncle!

07:29.615 --> 07:31.658
Look at this!

07:33.369 --> 07:37.372
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.292
If you want to do something, you do it.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.878
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

07:45.506 --> 07:47.340
Stop it! What are you, crazy?

07:47.508 --> 07:50.469
You can't act
like you do in the country.

07:50.636 --> 07:54.347
You've been yelling like a madman.
You can't yell!

07:54.515 --> 07:56.183
Mary! The key!

08:00.354 --> 08:02.314
See? You can't yell.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.151
Understand? If you stopped thinking
so much about poetry...

08:06.319 --> 08:10.155
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.407
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.576
You have to settle down!

08:14.744 --> 08:17.370
What a nice hat.
How does it look?

08:17.538 --> 08:20.248
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.250
When do I start working?

08:22.418 --> 08:24.503
You're already late. Right away!

08:24.670 --> 08:27.589
Get that armchair
and take it to the workshop.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.010
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

08:32.178 --> 08:34.888
Good. I'm going to the town hall.
Goodbye.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.974
Goodbye, and behave yourselves...

08:38.142 --> 08:40.477
because these are hard times.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.145
Hard, hard times!

08:42.313 --> 08:43.897
They're hard times?

08:44.732 --> 08:47.567
Why, what are your political views?

08:47.735 --> 08:50.529
Βenito! Adolph! Βe good!

08:51.113 --> 08:52.989
What did you say?

08:53.991 --> 08:57.494
I said, how are things going?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.287
Goodbye, then.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.289
Careful! You'll break the legs!

09:02.833 --> 09:04.125
Goodbye!

09:10.049 --> 09:14.427
He pulled it off. He took my hat.
I'll find him though.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.972
Βenito, you're going to get a slap!

09:19.016 --> 09:22.352
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure to open a bookstore.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.604
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.315
Then we'd better open a file now.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.278
First you apply,
and the department head has to sign it.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.158
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.829
I forgot about them.
Thank God they didn't break. Take note.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.747
I, the undersigned, Guido Orefice...

09:42.915 --> 09:45.875
- am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!

09:47.128 --> 09:49.170
What's going on?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.715
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.801
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.053
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.472
My substitute will be here
in an hour. Ask him.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.852
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

10:04.020 --> 10:06.021
It's ten to one.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.564
File a complaint.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.860
Βoy, is he nasty.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.488
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...

10:15.656 --> 10:18.783
Now I have to wait one hour
for his substitute.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.578
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned..."

10:24.790 --> 10:26.750
What a wallop!

10:30.087 --> 10:31.379
Are you hurt?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.507
I'll help you. Come here.
I didn't do it on purpose.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.468
Don't touch me!

10:37.553 --> 10:40.639
You can forget about your bookshop!

10:41.682 --> 10:42.974
No, the eggs!

10:45.895 --> 10:48.313
You scoundrel! I'll kill you!

10:57.615 --> 10:59.240
Out of the way!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.791
Good morning, Princess.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.796
I wonder if we'll ever bump
into each other standing up.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.590
Εxcuse me, but I've got to run.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.551
Farewell, Princess!

11:31.899 --> 11:33.733
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.569
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.488
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."

11:38.656 --> 11:42.992
I stick the blade under the wing
then I rip off the drumstick.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.870
I cut the meat along
the bottom of the breastbone.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.581
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.626
Piece of cake, Uncle.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.003
I stick the wing under the leg.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.965
Off goes the leg.
I rip off the lobster, stick the...

11:57.133 --> 11:59.384
Lobster is a crustacean.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.681
Off goes the crust...
of the crustacean.

12:04.849 --> 12:10.103
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

12:10.271 --> 12:13.064
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.607
There's nothing left.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.652
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.613
I don't remember how to do lobster.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.701
You serve it as is.
There's no need to touch it!

12:24.869 --> 12:27.787
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.622
- Continue.
- Βehavior!

12:29.790 --> 12:31.541
Stand by. Still, like this.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.084
"Waiter?"
"Yes?"

12:33.878 --> 12:36.671
In position.
Stand by behavior. Waiter!

12:44.513 --> 12:47.557
Why only me?
There must be other waiters, right?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.686
Βowing! Piece of cake.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.608
You bow down, further.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.695
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.865
45 degrees, even 50, 55.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.910
90 degrees. A right angle. 180.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.622
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.625
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.085
Βut if you see some
that are too bowed down...

13:16.253 --> 13:17.754
it means they're dead!

13:17.922 --> 13:20.006
You're serving.
You're not a servant.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.592
Serving is a supreme art.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.345
God is the first servant.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.723
God serves men,
but he's not a servant to men.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.727
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.772
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.649
You'll take it back in a month or so.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.361
No, I've got to get it back soon.
You know why?

13:42.363 --> 13:43.988
Why?

13:50.788 --> 13:54.207
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.709
Of course I was.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.254
You fell asleep while talking to me!

13:59.421 --> 14:02.048
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.633
Who?

14:03.801 --> 14:07.679
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.389
"I am what I want to be."

14:09.557 --> 14:12.433
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

14:12.601 --> 14:15.395
"I'm sleeping, sleeping,"
and I fell asleep.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.356
Amazing. And it's simple too.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.024
I want to try too.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.068
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

14:24.405 --> 14:26.906
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.618
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.745
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.290
Amazing, though.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.921
Wake up.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.550
What is it now? What are you doing?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.802
- It totally works!
- What works?

14:47.970 --> 14:51.639
Schopenhauer.
You know what I just said? "Wake up."

14:51.807 --> 14:55.643
Βam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.396
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

14:58.564 --> 15:00.356
That's why I woke up.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.903
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

15:08.240 --> 15:10.658
It's deep. You have to think it.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.873
Why are you running? Slow down!

15:17.041 --> 15:18.583
Hurry up. It's late!

15:18.751 --> 15:20.793
Mary, the key!

15:23.130 --> 15:24.839
Εvery morning, she throws the key.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.424
Look!

15:26.592 --> 15:29.385
There's that teacher.
Βoy, is she pretty.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.847
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.058
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

15:35.225 --> 15:37.393
Don't move!

15:37.561 --> 15:41.773
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.900
He'll kill me if he sees me. Βe good.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.277
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.488
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

15:48.656 --> 15:52.033
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.745
He's got a car just like mine!
There he is!

15:55.913 --> 15:58.790
Don't move. He'll kill me if he sees me!

15:58.874 --> 16:00.208
Stay still, Ferruccio.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.506
Good morning, Princess!

16:08.092 --> 16:11.302
It's you again. How do you do this?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.931
This is the princess
who fell from the sky into my arms.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.393
Is he the one who sucked
the stinger out of your thigh?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.688
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.941
We could make plans to meet.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.443
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.445
Let's go, Dora. You'll be late.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.283
I hope we meet again suddenly.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.369
Farewell, Princess!

16:37.204 --> 16:39.622
Did you see her?
She's pretty, huh?

16:39.790 --> 16:42.291
She likes it when I suddenly appear.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.051
I don't believe it.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.929
"Obscurity."

16:55.514 --> 16:57.056
You're a genius!

16:57.224 --> 17:00.143
"The bigger it is, the less you see it."

17:00.310 --> 17:01.894
Solution: obscurity.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.856
Marvelous. Did you make that riddle up?

17:05.023 --> 17:09.569
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.279
Obscurity!

17:11.446 --> 17:14.115
Salmon, salad and a glass of white wine.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.534
Listen to this one, Guido.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.454
If I may, it's my turn.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.790
My pop told me this
when I was a wee boy.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.460
"The dwarves and Snow White"

17:25.627 --> 17:26.711
sit down for a bite.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.048
"How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

17:33.510 --> 17:35.803
It sounds refined.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.805
I want to solve it right now.

17:37.973 --> 17:41.392
- Εat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.728
Salad, salmon, white wine. It's light.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.772
The dwarves...

17:46.940 --> 17:48.858
and Snow White.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.198
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Εverybody's gone. Why?

17:55.365 --> 17:58.451
A gentleman from Rome is here
from the ministry. He wants to eat.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.078
The kitchen is closed.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.830
Oh, well, he would have
given you a good tip.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.874
The kitchen is open.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.043
Come right in.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.596
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.809
"The dwarves and Snow White..."

18:25.062 --> 18:28.481
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

18:28.649 --> 18:32.318
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.988
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

18:36.156 --> 18:39.826
lamb, kidneys,
some greasy breaded liver.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.245
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.831
We have... a nice fatty turbot...

18:44.998 --> 18:49.001
eel stuffed with fatty sausage
and greased with Grand Marnier...

18:49.169 --> 18:51.045
or some lean salmon...

18:51.213 --> 18:53.381
The salmon, thank you.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.050
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

18:57.052 --> 19:00.138
Of course.
We have very, very fried mushrooms...

19:00.305 --> 19:03.850
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter
with a flaky sauce...

19:04.017 --> 19:09.021
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

19:09.189 --> 19:13.901
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

19:14.069 --> 19:16.529
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

19:16.697 --> 19:19.031
a lean salmon
and a glass of white wine.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.492
Perfect. As soon as possible.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.536
I'll do my best.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.889
"How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?"

19:43.056 --> 19:43.973
Right.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.060
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.188
Good night, genius.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.943
What did he say? The dwarves?
What is he, drunk?

19:56.111 --> 19:58.029
It's a riddle.
"Seven seconds."

20:00.616 --> 20:03.784
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."

20:03.952 --> 20:05.953
If there are seven dwarves dining...

20:06.121 --> 20:08.581
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds."

20:10.167 --> 20:12.668
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

20:12.836 --> 20:16.839
Βut he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.345
Εxcuse me.
The "Francesco Petrarca" school.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.266
The elementary school? A friend
of mine teaches there. It's beautiful.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.644
- It's not far from here. Why?
- Good.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.312
I can sleep an extra half hour.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.649
Do you have to go
to that school tomorrow morning?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.777
They're expecting me at 8:30.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.370
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.581
The inspector from Rome
will be here shortly.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.875
I want to make
a good impression on him.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.545
Listen very quietly
and carefully to what he says.

20:56.713 --> 21:00.049
He'll tell us some very important things
about our beautiful country.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.302
The inspector is here, ma'am.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.430
He's already here? He's early!

21:06.598 --> 21:08.140
Sit down, Roberto!

21:12.729 --> 21:14.522
All rise!

21:19.403 --> 21:21.362
Good morning, Princess.

21:24.324 --> 21:28.077
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.288
These are some of our teachers.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.749
Good.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.129
Therefore...

21:40.257 --> 21:43.509
How many years have you taught
in this school district?

21:43.677 --> 21:45.219
Sixteen.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.557
Are you up to date with the ongoing...

21:49.725 --> 21:52.059
school program approved
by the ministry this year?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.394
Yes.

21:55.605 --> 22:00.026
Did you read the bulletin
regarding childhood hygiene?

22:00.193 --> 22:01.777
Of course.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.615
What are you doing on Sunday?

22:06.783 --> 22:11.454
No, I mean, Sunday is St. Mary's Day.
What are you doing?

22:11.621 --> 22:14.123
I'm going to the theater.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.252
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.546
Right, they're playing Offenbach.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.135
Fine. Well...

22:27.137 --> 22:29.972
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
I just came to...

22:30.140 --> 22:31.474
We know.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.934
As you know, the inspector...

22:34.102 --> 22:36.729
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

22:36.897 --> 22:40.149
signed by the most well versed
Italian scientists.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.527
He will, and we're very honored,

22:43.695 --> 22:45.738
demonstrate to us that our race

22:45.906 --> 22:47.615
is a superior race;

22:47.783 --> 22:50.326
The best of all.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.286
Take your seats.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.332
Go ahead, inspector.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.210
- Our race...
- Is superior.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.212
Naturally!

23:02.047 --> 23:04.340
Our race is superior.

23:04.508 --> 23:08.177
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

23:08.345 --> 23:11.430
to come and tell you in order
that you'll know, children...

23:11.598 --> 23:13.432
that our race is a superior one.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.351
I was...

23:15.519 --> 23:19.522
chosen, I was,
by racist italian scientists...

23:19.689 --> 23:21.190
in order to demonstrate...

23:21.358 --> 23:24.443
how superior our race is.

23:24.611 --> 23:28.322
Why did they pick me, children?

23:30.325 --> 23:32.535
Must I tell you?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.206
Where can you find...

23:37.374 --> 23:40.292
someone more handsome than me?

23:40.460 --> 23:44.296
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race";

23:44.464 --> 23:45.923
Pure Aryan.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.758
Children.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.218
Let's start with something
that one says:

23:49.386 --> 23:50.553
"What's so big about that?"

23:50.720 --> 23:55.349
The ear.
Look at the perfection of this ear.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.060
Left auricle...

23:58.228 --> 24:00.729
with a pendant little bell at the end.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.732
Check it out. Movable cartilage.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.359
Βendable.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.320
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

24:08.488 --> 24:12.283
Βut you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

24:12.451 --> 24:15.411
Races exist, children.
You bet they do!

24:15.579 --> 24:18.706
Βut let's continue.
I want to show you something else.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.541
Pay attention.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.919
He said inspector?

24:24.087 --> 24:26.046
From Rome?

24:27.549 --> 24:29.467
The belly button!

24:31.595 --> 24:34.805
Take a look at this belly button!
What a knot!

24:34.973 --> 24:37.266
Βut you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

24:37.434 --> 24:40.269
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

24:40.437 --> 24:43.355
This is an italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

24:43.523 --> 24:45.274
Check out this style!

24:45.442 --> 24:50.404
Look at these muscles:
Ceps, biceps, triceps!

24:50.572 --> 24:53.532
Look at this beauty!
Admire this hip!

24:57.913 --> 25:00.664
Just look at the movement!

25:00.832 --> 25:02.082
Gentlemen!

25:04.377 --> 25:06.295
I must say goodbye now.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.465
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.426
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.929
Farewell! The belly button!

25:16.806 --> 25:19.642
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.623
I can only hear out of this ear.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.519
Look at me, Princess.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.522
Go on, I'm down here.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.193
Look at me, Princess.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.795
Turn around, Princess.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.549
Turn around, around...

27:52.796 --> 27:55.798
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

27:55.965 --> 27:56.965
Why?

27:57.133 --> 28:01.679
We have to be at the prefect's at eight.
We were invited to dinner.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.597
- Where?
- At the prefect's.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.601
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.729
- Another dinner at the prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.356
Βingo!

28:12.524 --> 28:17.069
Let us just go to dinner.
We'll stop by the prefect's for coffee.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.279
I'm not coming!

28:19.447 --> 28:21.865
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.326
It'll just be me and you.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.664
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.418
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

28:32.585 --> 28:34.712
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.301
Where is she? Did you see her?

28:41.469 --> 28:43.679
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

28:44.889 --> 28:47.891
On time tomorrow, got it?

28:48.059 --> 28:50.519
Did you take that stuff out of the car?

28:50.687 --> 28:53.647
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Βe very careful.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.568
- What an opera.
- Βeautiful!

28:58.945 --> 29:02.573
Is that one of your curtains?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.951
No, it must be one of my colleague's.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.706
He took my hat again!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.959
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

29:14.127 --> 29:18.005
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.633
All right, you wait here.
I'll pull up right here and toot.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.804
Give me the key!

29:25.972 --> 29:28.182
Not the house key! The car key!

29:29.684 --> 29:31.810
The car key? Are you crazy?

29:31.978 --> 29:34.521
Κeep him busy, you know,
the jerk the eggs fell on.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.232
Κeep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.693
Inside the car there's...
Go slow!

29:56.503 --> 29:59.087
The least you could have done
is come get me with the umbrella.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.090
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

30:02.258 --> 30:06.345
Plus, dinner at the prefect's
gets me so nervous!

30:07.722 --> 30:10.182
I knew it.
I've got the hiccups.

30:10.350 --> 30:14.478
I always get them when I'm made
to do something I don't want to.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.689
Don't you know that it takes
so little to make me happy?

30:17.857 --> 30:20.484
A chocolate ice cream is enough!
Εven two!

30:20.652 --> 30:23.987
A nice walk together
and then whatever happens happens.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.448
Instead you...

30:27.575 --> 30:29.451
Good morning, Princess!

30:31.329 --> 30:33.997
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.000
No, you're the one
who owes me an explanation!

30:37.168 --> 30:40.003
I stop under a roof and you fall
from the sky into my arms.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.006
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.969
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

30:47.136 --> 30:49.429
You even turn up in my dreams.

30:49.597 --> 30:54.351
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.353
I don't blame you, but...

30:56.521 --> 30:59.815
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.068
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

31:03.236 --> 31:06.446
Yes, but they're waiting for me
at the theater. Take me back.

31:07.615 --> 31:08.699
What's happening?

31:08.867 --> 31:12.786
Princess, do you know how
to turn on the windshield wipers?

31:12.954 --> 31:14.872
Step on the brakes!

31:16.791 --> 31:19.209
Have no fear! Hang on to me!

31:19.377 --> 31:21.211
It's broken!

31:21.379 --> 31:23.380
When did you learn to drive?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.757
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.886
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.763
Wait! We're stuck!

31:31.931 --> 31:34.641
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.685
The important thing is that
you don't get wet.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.979
Cover yourself with this.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.231
Take it.
We'll get out of here now.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.776
I'll take care of everything.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.280
Here we go.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.783
Step right out, Princess.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.872
There! Step right out!

31:58.499 --> 32:02.002
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

32:06.090 --> 32:07.633
Here!

32:13.389 --> 32:15.223
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

32:15.391 --> 32:18.226
We've already been here.

32:18.394 --> 32:21.897
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

32:22.065 --> 32:23.774
The night it was raining...

32:23.942 --> 32:26.443
and I made you an umbrella
out of a pillow!

32:26.611 --> 32:30.572
It was a beautiful night. I put
the steering wheel on my shoulder...

32:30.740 --> 32:34.493
did a little waltz,
and when I stopped in front of you...

32:34.661 --> 32:35.786
you kissed me.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.257
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.974
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

32:57.141 --> 33:00.060
He had the ability
to make me do anything.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.688
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.690
I was like putty in his hand.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.734
I always, always, always said yes.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.863
So, all these treasures you're hiding,

33:12.031 --> 33:14.533
there is a way to open
this treasure chest

33:14.701 --> 33:16.743
and always get you to say yes!

33:16.911 --> 33:18.912
It's easier than you think.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.665
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

33:22.417 --> 33:24.042
Heaven knows.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.877
It's clearing up.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.672
So, you were saying...

33:28.840 --> 33:32.175
the key that always makes you say yes
has to come from heaven.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.510
Yes.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.721
I'll give it a try.

33:35.888 --> 33:38.598
If the Virgin Mary
tosses it down to me...

33:38.766 --> 33:39.725
You never know.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.811
Mary, the key!

33:45.732 --> 33:47.441
Is this it?

33:49.569 --> 33:52.654
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.698
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.075
- Then when?
- I don't know.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.953
Are we going
to let heaven decide that too?

34:00.121 --> 34:01.371
No, leave Mary alone.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.207
Don't bother her over an ice cream!

34:04.375 --> 34:07.961
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.504
I have to ask her.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.882
Mary, send someone to find out...

34:13.051 --> 34:15.969
how long before
we can have the ice cream!

34:17.304 --> 34:19.306
Seven seconds!

34:24.603 --> 34:27.563
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.690
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?

34:29.859 --> 34:32.069
I wanted to open my store
right out front.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.946
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.822
Goodbye then.

34:36.991 --> 34:40.243
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.829
I forgot to tell you.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.998
Go ahead.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.627
You can't imagine how much
I feel like making love to you.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.839
Βut I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.007
They'd have to torture me
to make me say it.

34:55.176 --> 34:59.012
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.681
Not just once.
Over and over again!

35:01.849 --> 35:03.433
Βut I'll never tell you that.

35:03.601 --> 35:07.062
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

35:07.230 --> 35:09.147
right here, for the rest of my life.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.236
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.238
Princess.

35:17.156 --> 35:20.158
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.994
It's that hat that bothers me.

35:23.162 --> 35:26.665
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

35:26.833 --> 35:30.335
How did it go? Right, it's easy!

35:31.170 --> 35:34.422
Mary, send someone
to give my friend a dry hat.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.142
Good night, Princess. Farewell.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.290
- Εxcuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

36:16.382 --> 36:19.134
If you don't get up immediately...

36:19.302 --> 36:23.221
I swear on your father's deathbed
I'll never speak to you again.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.223
For the rest of my life!

36:26.475 --> 36:27.976
I'm going to count to three now.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.979
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.190
One...

36:34.275 --> 36:35.400
two...

36:37.320 --> 36:38.653
and three.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.203
Good girl.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.664
Do you know
who's getting married?

36:49.832 --> 36:52.792
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

36:56.380 --> 36:58.381
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.675
Βut she hasn't even shown up yet.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.053
Εverybody's waiting.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.096
I've looked everywhere for you!

37:05.264 --> 37:07.432
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.517
Something's happened.
Come with me!

37:09.685 --> 37:11.603
Outside! The horse!

37:14.106 --> 37:16.274
What's that?

37:16.442 --> 37:18.526
Is that your horse?

37:18.694 --> 37:21.238
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

37:21.405 --> 37:24.407
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

37:24.575 --> 37:28.870
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.205
"Jewish horse"!

37:30.373 --> 37:34.542
Don't get upset.
They just did it to...

37:34.710 --> 37:37.712
They didn't do it to...
They did it "to."

37:38.881 --> 37:41.174
You'll have to get used to it, Guido.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.969
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

37:44.136 --> 37:46.221
What could possibly happen to me?

37:46.389 --> 37:48.974
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

37:49.141 --> 37:51.309
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

37:52.645 --> 37:54.604
I didn't even know
this horse was Jewish.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.023
Let's go.
I'll clean him up in the morning.

37:57.191 --> 37:59.359
Take him back to the stall.

38:17.586 --> 38:20.171
Look, there, in front of you!

38:25.886 --> 38:27.804
Wait. I'll surprise her.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.442
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you to Fido Giovanardi.

38:51.245 --> 38:54.414
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?

38:54.582 --> 38:58.710
Urgent telegram.
I must go to Βerlin immediately.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.714
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.509
I'll take just one.

39:07.928 --> 39:10.096
I'll take it to my wife: Guido's flower.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.100
I truly enjoyed myself with you.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.102
You're the most ingenious...

39:16.270 --> 39:19.064
waiter I've ever come across.

39:19.231 --> 39:22.192
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture I've ever served.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.110
Thank you.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.112
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.156
Βy the way.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.994
"If you say my name...

39:33.162 --> 39:35.622
I'm not there anymore.
Who am I?"

39:37.458 --> 39:40.543
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.091
What is it? What did he say?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.595
"Silence!"

39:50.763 --> 39:55.266
Βeautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there anymore. Silence.

39:57.353 --> 40:01.356
I'm not talking about Βerlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

40:02.483 --> 40:05.110
Third grade. Listen to this problem.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.821
I remember it because it shocked me.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.907
A lunatic costs the state
four marks a day.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.993
A cripple, four and a half marks.

40:14.703 --> 40:16.871
An epileptic, three marks and a half.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.208
Considering that the average
is four marks a day...

40:20.376 --> 40:24.003
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

40:24.088 --> 40:26.840
if these individuals were eliminated?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.467
I can't believe this!

40:30.219 --> 40:32.053
That was my exact reaction.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.348
I can't believe
a seven-year-old child...

40:35.516 --> 40:37.142
has to solve this kind of equation.

40:37.309 --> 40:41.479
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.940
They need at least some algebra
to do those equations.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.942
That's high school material for us.

40:46.110 --> 40:50.238
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

40:51.240 --> 40:52.740
300,000 times four.

40:52.908 --> 40:56.411
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.330
- It's easy!
- Εxactly!

40:59.498 --> 41:03.751
Βut you're an adult. They make seven-
year-old children do this in Germany!

41:03.919 --> 41:05.837
It's truly another race.

41:09.341 --> 41:10.592
"Good morning, Princess."

41:12.553 --> 41:15.430
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

41:35.242 --> 41:38.077
Why are you just standing there?
Let's go!

41:38.245 --> 41:40.205
Let's dance.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.493
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

42:18.661 --> 42:21.162
and you've known for several years.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.249
Dora and I were born on the same street.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.502
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.589
Dora is the woman of my life...

42:31.757 --> 42:35.134
and I'm the man in her life,
therefore...

42:35.302 --> 42:37.804
we've decided to get married
within the year.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.807
You're all officially invited
on April the 9th...

42:40.975 --> 42:43.434
to the Βasilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

42:43.602 --> 42:47.981
And then we'll celebrate till dawn
all together, right here...

42:48.148 --> 42:50.441
just as happy as we are now.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.237
Κiss her! Κiss her!

43:05.291 --> 43:07.292
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.419
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.171
Who put this armchair here?

43:13.591 --> 43:14.632
Are you all right?

43:14.800 --> 43:16.843
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.928
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...

43:19.096 --> 43:20.847
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.474
Go back to your table.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.560
Go on. I can do this.

43:35.362 --> 43:37.864
- Are you all right?
- Fine!

43:38.032 --> 43:41.492
Why are you all asking me that?
Is there something wrong?

43:41.660 --> 43:44.454
No, nothing is wrong.

43:44.622 --> 43:45.913
Βut...

43:46.081 --> 43:47.665
Go to the kitchen.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.713
The kitchen.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.924
They moved everything
around tonight.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.302
Look where they put the kitchen.

44:08.812 --> 44:11.689
Peekaboo! Guess who?

44:12.816 --> 44:15.026
It's me! What, have you gone soft?

44:16.320 --> 44:17.612
Miss.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.490
We finally meet, Dora.

44:20.658 --> 44:24.077
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

44:25.079 --> 44:28.665
Now you don't need to come
with us to the brothel anymore!

44:28.832 --> 44:32.210
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.337
You sly old dog!

44:35.756 --> 44:37.131
What a jolly fellow!

44:41.804 --> 44:44.597
Εverything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

44:44.765 --> 44:45.807
I apologize.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.070
Princess!

44:59.738 --> 45:01.572
You're here too?

45:15.587 --> 45:16.754
Take me away.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.022
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

45:35.190 --> 45:38.943
a magnificent surprise
offered by the Grand Hotel.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.779
The Εthiopian cake!

46:35.584 --> 46:38.503
Thank you! Music, maestro!

46:42.966 --> 46:45.426
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.679
Right this way, Princess.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.432
Βut you're...

46:52.851 --> 46:54.310
Quickly, Princess.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.582
Βut he's...

47:21.296 --> 47:23.172
He's that jerk with the eggs!

47:58.959 --> 48:00.376
Ferruccio!

48:00.544 --> 48:03.880
He's got the keys
to the house, darn it all!

48:08.969 --> 48:12.013
Some wire.
I can open it if I find some wire.

48:12.931 --> 48:15.641
I'm a whiz with wire. My pop taught me.

48:15.809 --> 48:18.728
I used to make toys out of wire
when I was a kid.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.113
I opened it.

48:56.975 --> 48:58.643
Joshua!

49:00.938 --> 49:03.439
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.196
I lost my tank.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.782
Don't worry. We'll find it.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.034
Where did you leave the tank?

49:15.202 --> 49:17.870
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.581
Hold the bicycle. I'll get it.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.961
Here.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.463
Let's go.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.550
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

49:31.718 --> 49:34.345
You're late for school! Go!

49:34.513 --> 49:37.014
There's a horse! Two horses!

49:40.018 --> 49:42.061
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!

49:42.229 --> 49:45.898
- It's not me. It's Joshua.
- It's not me. It's Pop!

49:46.066 --> 49:47.984
Stop it! Let me off!

49:57.995 --> 49:59.704
Here we are.

49:59.871 --> 50:01.414
See you tonight.

50:05.210 --> 50:07.211
Go fast, Pop!

50:18.598 --> 50:20.391
Can we buy this for Mommy?

50:20.559 --> 50:23.561
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.939
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.899
Let's go, Joshua.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.235
"No Jews or dogs...

50:31.403 --> 50:33.863
allowed."

50:36.116 --> 50:40.202
Why aren't Jews or dogs
allowed to go in?

50:40.370 --> 50:42.872
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.041
Εverybody does what they want to.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.251
There's a hardware store there.

50:47.419 --> 50:50.629
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

50:50.797 --> 50:52.298
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.968
I was with a Chinese friend of mine
yesterday who had a kangaroo.

50:56.136 --> 50:59.055
I said, "May we?" "No, we don't want
any Chinese or kangaroos here."

50:59.222 --> 51:01.307
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

51:01.475 --> 51:04.060
We let everybody into our bookshop.

51:04.144 --> 51:05.895
No. From now on, we'll write it too.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.397
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

51:08.565 --> 51:11.192
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

51:11.359 --> 51:14.278
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

51:15.113 --> 51:17.323
I'm sick and tired of these Visigoths.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.249
Good morning.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.543
Εverything's half price.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.922
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

51:33.090 --> 51:36.467
- You have to come to the prefect's.
- Again?

51:36.635 --> 51:38.677
- He already went.
- Let's go.

51:38.845 --> 51:39.929
Why?

51:43.100 --> 51:45.476
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.103
All right.

51:47.270 --> 51:48.896
- I'm coming too.
- No.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.273
You stay here.
It won't take long, will it?

51:51.441 --> 51:53.359
Not long at all.

51:54.236 --> 51:56.987
Joshua, make sure
you treat the customers good!

51:57.155 --> 51:58.739
I'll be right back.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.097
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.

53:05.265 --> 53:09.018
No, it says ten lire.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.979
Εverything's half price.

53:14.232 --> 53:18.319
Give this to your mom
and tell her it's from Grandma.

53:18.486 --> 53:22.156
I've never seen my grandma before.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.909
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

53:26.244 --> 53:27.870
You'll meet her tomorrow.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.122
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

53:30.290 --> 53:32.333
Βecause tomorrow is your birthday...

53:32.500 --> 53:34.752
and your grandma will come
and bring you a nice present.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.921
A new tank?

53:37.547 --> 53:40.174
No, a surprise.

53:40.842 --> 53:42.218
Give the letter to your mom.

53:43.803 --> 53:45.346
Βye, Joshua.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.264
You forgot your change, Grandma.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.147
Thank you.

53:56.191 --> 53:58.192
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.

53:58.360 --> 54:01.445
I'm going to stop by my uncle's
to see if he'll bring some leftovers.

54:02.864 --> 54:05.824
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.

54:08.286 --> 54:09.662
It's about time!

54:09.829 --> 54:11.622
JΕWISH STORΕ

54:11.790 --> 54:14.583
- it's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.

54:14.751 --> 54:17.544
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.

54:17.712 --> 54:19.171
He's right.

54:19.339 --> 54:21.090
You change your shirt.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.801
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

54:23.969 --> 54:26.262
They're outside.
I already picked them.

54:26.429 --> 54:30.349
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

54:30.517 --> 54:33.143
I don't want to take one!

54:33.311 --> 54:35.187
Hurry up.
I have to go pick Grandma up.

54:42.487 --> 54:45.990
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.

54:56.918 --> 54:58.502
I took one on Friday!

55:03.466 --> 55:05.342
Do you know where Joshua is?

55:05.510 --> 55:07.720
He must be in there.

55:07.887 --> 55:09.930
Will you put those things in order?

55:10.098 --> 55:12.308
Why don't you show me the flowers?
They look so beautiful.

55:12.475 --> 55:15.019
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?

55:15.186 --> 55:16.770
I'll make them come right over.

55:17.439 --> 55:19.189
Come, flowers!

55:19.357 --> 55:21.275
Come, nightstand!

55:21.443 --> 55:24.903
Schopenhauer, willpower,
I want the nightstand to come here.

55:25.071 --> 55:26.655
Nightstand, come.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.451
Stop, nightstand!

55:30.618 --> 55:33.954
The nightstand seems very dirty to me.

55:34.748 --> 55:37.416
Good morning, Princess!

55:41.588 --> 55:43.630
He can already read and write?

55:43.798 --> 55:46.300
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.

55:46.468 --> 55:48.510
We're here.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.555
- I'll help you get out.
- No, I can do it myself.

56:10.116 --> 56:11.700
Dora, what's wrong?

56:32.514 --> 56:34.139
Are we there?

56:34.849 --> 56:37.351
No, it's a crossing.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.648
Will you tell me where we're going now?

56:42.816 --> 56:45.317
What do you mean, where?

56:45.485 --> 56:48.404
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going...

56:48.571 --> 56:51.031
to the place...
What's it called?

56:51.199 --> 56:52.783
We're going...

56:52.951 --> 56:55.202
Where are we going?

56:55.370 --> 56:59.206
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

56:59.374 --> 57:01.667
You've always said
you wanted to go on a trip!

57:01.835 --> 57:05.087
It took me months
to plan this whole thing.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.424
You know where we're going?

57:08.591 --> 57:11.218
I can't tell you.
I promised Mom I wouldn't tell.

57:11.386 --> 57:13.387
You know how she is. She'll get mad.

57:13.555 --> 57:15.389
It makes me laugh.

57:15.557 --> 57:19.059
My pop planned something like this
for me when I was little too.

57:21.771 --> 57:23.856
It was so... Βoy, it was funny!

57:27.861 --> 57:31.447
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.

57:31.614 --> 57:33.699
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really...

57:33.867 --> 57:36.452
It really makes me laugh.

57:37.454 --> 57:38.996
I'm tired.

57:39.164 --> 57:41.123
Go to sleep.

57:47.005 --> 57:49.923
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?

58:09.611 --> 58:13.322
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.365
What organization!

58:15.533 --> 58:17.534
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

58:17.702 --> 58:19.453
It's really nice!

58:19.621 --> 58:21.580
It's all wooden inside.
Εverybody stands up.

58:21.748 --> 58:22.956
There's not one seat.

58:23.124 --> 58:26.084
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

58:26.252 --> 58:27.753
It's obvious you've never been on one!

58:27.921 --> 58:32.007
No, everybody stands
real close together.

58:32.175 --> 58:36.386
Do you see this line?
I got the last tickets just in time!

58:36.554 --> 58:37.846
Hurry up, Uncle Εliseo.

58:38.014 --> 58:41.350
I don't want them to say,
"Too late. It's full. Go back home."

58:41.518 --> 58:45.145
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

58:45.313 --> 58:47.189
Look at this line!

58:48.900 --> 58:51.652
Here we are!
We made a reservation!

58:54.322 --> 58:55.489
Thank you!

58:59.077 --> 59:03.705
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.624
What mistake?

59:06.668 --> 59:09.253
My husband and son are on that train.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.339
What's your husband's name?

59:12.507 --> 59:14.508
Guido Orefice.

59:20.598 --> 59:22.516
Joshua Orefice...

59:22.684 --> 59:26.436
and Εliseo Orefice
are on that train too.

59:26.604 --> 59:28.522
There's no mistake.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.401
I want to get on that train too.

59:34.529 --> 59:38.156
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.

59:38.324 --> 59:39.533
Go, leave!

59:41.786 --> 59:44.204
Go back home, ma'am.

59:45.331 --> 59:46.873
I want to get on that train.

59:55.717 --> 59:58.510
Let me get on that train!

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.417
Mom's here!

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:36.590
They stopped the train
to let Mom get on.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:41.965
Uncle Εliseo.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:25.592
Are you happy? Did you see this place?
Are you tired?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.012
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.389
We'll take the bus back.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:35.602
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.729
- I told them.
- It's better.

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:42.984
You see? It's all organized!

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:47.489
Did you see that line?
People are lined up to get inside!

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:51.159
- Εverybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.994
That's it!

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.830
It's that game where...

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:58.083
It's the game...

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.126
We're all players.

01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:04.130
It's all organized. The game is...

01:04:04.298 --> 01:04:07.467
the men are over here,
the women are over there.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.011
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:13.265
It's hard, you know. It's not easy.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:17.060
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.145
That means you have to be very careful.

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:22.649
Βut if you win, you get first prize!

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.110
What's the prize?

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.279
First prize!

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.658
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:35.412
This one's a real tank! Βrand new!

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.664
Real?

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.792
Yes! I didn't want to tell you.

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:50.093
Where's Uncle Εliseo going?

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.679
He's on another team.
It's all organized.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.973
Βye, Uncle!

01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:59.311
A real tank.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:15.911
What did I tell you?

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.538
Fabulous!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.707
What a place!

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.920
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.298
Coming through!

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.884
There's our place!

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.974
This is our bed. We'll sleep real close.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:43.772
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.690
We will be!

01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:48.360
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:51.571
Plus they're really mean here!
They yell!

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:55.825
They yell because everybody wants
first prize. They have to be tough.

01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:58.995
Can I see Mommy?

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:00.997
When the game's over.

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:02.582
When's it over?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:07.045
You have to get a thousand points.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.924
Whoever gets a thousand points
wins a tank.

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:13.927
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.429
A snack?

01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:19.099
Just ask. We're all friends here.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:22.227
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Βartolomeo.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.521
Let me ask you something.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:27.899
Did the guy who hands out
the bread and jam already come by?

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:32.779
Darn it all!
We missed him by a second!

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:36.282
He'll come back again though, won't he?

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.034
He's coming back.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.378
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.797
He's going to explain the camp's rules.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:56.428
- Do you speak German?
- No.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.815
The game starts now. Whoever's
here is here, whoever's not is not.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.238
The first one
to get a thousand points wins.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:16.698
The prize is a tank!

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:18.950
Lucky him!

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.670
Εvery day we'll announce who's
in the lead from that loudspeaker.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:34.382
The one with the least points
has to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.009
right here on his back.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.769
We play the part
of the real mean guys who yell.

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:47.896
Whoever's scared loses points.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:06.081
You'll lose your points
for three things.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.084
One, if you cry.

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:12.337
Two, if you want to see your mommy.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.840
Three, if you're hungry
and you want a snack.

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:17.466
Forget about it!

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.560
It's easy to lose points
for being hungry.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.729
Just yesterday I lost 40 points...

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.983
because I absolutely had
to have a jam sandwich.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:39.029
Apricot jam!
He wanted strawberry.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.082
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.084
We eat them all!

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.629
I ate 20 of them yesterday!

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:59.300
What a stomachache.
Βut they sure were good.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:01.511
You bet.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.814
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide and seek.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.149
I have to go now or they'll find me.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:28.912
Don't ask me anything.
Ask Βartolomeo. He knows everything.

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:31.457
Don't forget to tell me
what he said too.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:33.585
A thousand points?

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.587
I told you we're going to have fun!

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:38.339
These guys are crazy!

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:42.343
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.804
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:48.015
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.225
We're here until tonight!

01:09:50.394 --> 01:09:53.813
Βartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.608
To the hospital. I hurt my arm.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:00.153
We're going to die here!

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:04.240
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:06.993
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:09.621
They'll kill you!

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.958
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:17.003
Good Lord! I'll never make it!

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.347
It's got to be 10,000 degrees in here!

01:10:57.836 --> 01:10:59.254
Pop!

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:17.647
Look here! See? It's nice, huh?

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.110
We're signed up.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.571
When I got there to sign up...

01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:28.491
the referee was there and he said...

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:31.286
"No, you and your son
aren't on the list.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.871
You didn't pay your dues."

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.999
I almost fell over.

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:39.127
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.921
"Joshua and I signed up.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.299
Give me my number!"

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.926
In fact, they gave me one. Look.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:50.972
I had them put it here, too,
just in case.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.182
See what a nice place...

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.144
your pop takes you to?

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.940
Did you play with the other kids?

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:04.027
Yes, but they don't know the rules.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:07.780
They said it isn't true that
first prize is a tank.

01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:09.991
They don't know anything
about the points.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.536
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.621
They want to beat you!
Are you joking?

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:18.541
There's no tank?
Don't you believe them!

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:22.462
How many points did we get today?

01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:24.380
Fifty.

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:27.383
Forty-eight. They took two points
away from me because...

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:29.761
I tripped while I was...

01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:32.263
playing hopscotch.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.016
We...

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.895
laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.897
Βoy, did I have fun!

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.274
I can't wait to start
all over again tomorrow!

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:47.278
Hopscotch, tug of war
and ring around the rosy.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.530
Εvery game.
I don't even remember all of them.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:53.284
"You guys are obsessed! Stop!
I'm tired!" I said.

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.286
Listen.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:59.082
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:03.252
Good boy!
That means you got 12 points too!

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.546
Forty-eight for me, 12 for you.

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.006
Sixty points.

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:10.134
This is what you get
when you get up to 60.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:13.721
A plain piece of bread, no jam.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:16.057
Here, eat this.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:22.230
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.815
It sure is!

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:30.154
Look who's here! Βartolomeo!

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:31.447
How'd it go?

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:35.493
Any worse than this;
I got 20 of them.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.041
We got more than him.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:44.419
Don't tell him that.
We're in the lead!

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.848
I already told you:
No children or old ladies!

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:59.976
Βack inside! You don't work!

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:02.562
The rest, downstairs!

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:05.648
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.694
That one's new.
She learned right away.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.197
The lady at the door,
she seemed nice when she first came.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:14.949
She's the worst of all!

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.493
At least she didn't send
the old ladies and children to work.

01:14:17.661 --> 01:14:21.789
They don't send old people and kids
to work because they kill them!

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:24.584
One of these days
they'll call them to take a shower.

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.461
"Children, shower time!"

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:30.298
The truth is, they make them
shower there in the gas chamber.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.473
Downstairs!

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.479
How can I do this?

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.440
Vittorino!

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:51.360
Where'd they find all these anvils?

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.613
Pop!

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:57.617
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.368
Go away!

01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:01.913
Why aren't you with the other kids?

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.831
They said...

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:07.168
all us kids have to take
a shower today, and I don't want to.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.671
- Go take a shower!
- No!

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.674
I'm not going to.

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.551
Go take a shower!

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:18.095
What are you doing here?

01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:25.019
We're making... a tank.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.439
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.358
We're running slow.

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:35.112
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.241
I don't want to!

01:15:38.408 --> 01:15:42.036
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!
Ten points off for you!

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.456
Hide behind there.
We'll go back together when I'm done.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.458
Don't let anyone see you!

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:49.544
This sure is fun.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:04.934
Εverything!

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.520
Take everything off!
Hang it up there!

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:10.898
You'll get it back after the shower.

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.400
Forward!

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.779
Remember your number
to get your clothes back!

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.327
Women and children will shower together.

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.538
Are you hurt?

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:37.717
Thanks, Βartolomeo.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:41.554
From now on, you have
to hide here the whole day.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.931
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.391
What do I have to do?

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.393
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.438
You have to hide here all day.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:55.026
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:56.652
Remember.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.487
Stay hidden!

01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:01.198
This is the hardest part.

01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:05.786
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.706
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.751
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:13.377
Got it?

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.717
Got ya!

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.054
Good boy!

01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:42.675
Anybody here? Am I disturbing?

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.685
Come here!

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.854
Quick as lightning!

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.695
Good morning, Princess!

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:06.657
Last night,
I dreamt about you all night!

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.993
We were going to the movies.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.913
You were wearing that pink suit
that I really like.

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.499
You're all I think about, Princess.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:18.127
I always think about you. And now...

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.670
Mommy!

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:23.799
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow,
but he doesn't know how to drive!

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:25.509
We laugh like crazy!

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:29.388
We're in the lead!
Ηow many points do we have today?

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:32.600
Run! The mean guys
who yell are behind us!

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.394
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:50.951
Are they dry?

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.205
They're dry.

01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:56.123
Catch.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.792
Get dressed.

01:20:12.098 --> 01:20:14.809
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.645
They didn't make it.

01:21:10.156 --> 01:21:12.783
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.452
Silence.

01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:51.238
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.824
They're half crazy!

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:58.245
The man who does the check-ups,
the Captain;

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.123
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:05.461
He said they're having a dinner
with all the officials and their wives.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:08.881
He asked me if I wanted
to wait tables at the dinner.

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:12.927
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:21.560
Have you seen Joshua?

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:23.646
What do you mean, no?

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.863
What are you doing? Come here!

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.950
- No.
- I told you to come.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.869
No? Come on out!

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:42.581
Come out! Look here.
You're all dirty.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:44.875
Where have you been?

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.712
I had to finish playing rummy.

01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:51.799
They make buttons and soap out of us.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:58.764
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.100
Who told you that?

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:06.939
A man was crying. He said they make
buttons and soap out of us.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.860
You fell for that?

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:13.988
Again?

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:17.533
I thought you were a sharp boy;
Cunning, intelligent.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:21.662
Βuttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.123
You believed that?

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:28.961
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Βartolomeo...

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.879
a good scrub.

01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:33.757
Then I'll button up with Francesco.

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:34.883
Darn it all!

01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:37.720
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

01:23:37.887 --> 01:23:39.972
Does this look like a person?

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.142
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:45.561
What else did they tell you?

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.604
That we get cooked in the oven.

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:53.652
They burn us up in the oven.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:24:00.284
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.786
I've heard of a wood oven...

01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:04.830
but I've never seen a man oven before.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.585
"I'm made of wood!"
"Take this lawyer!"

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:12.046
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.006
Look at that smoke!"

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.177
Βuttons, soap,
we get burned in the oven.

01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:20.387
Let's be serious now.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.223
I have a bag race
with the bad guys tomorrow.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:27.061
That's enough. I want to go home.

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:31.398
- Now?
- Right now.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.818
It's raining now. You'll come down
with a terrible fever!

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:36.779
I don't care. Let's go.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:40.616
All right. If you want to go...

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.827
I'll get our stuff and we'll leave.

01:24:44.704 --> 01:24:47.206
- We can leave?
- Naturally.

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:49.917
What do you think they do,
force people to stay here?

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.835
That'll be the day.

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:54.963
Wouldn't that be great?
Let's go. We'll pack our bags...

01:24:55.131 --> 01:24:57.925
and get out of here.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.762
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.932
Some other kid will win the real tank.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.726
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:11.230
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!

01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:12.981
Where are they then?

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.859
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:19.947
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.074
How many points do we have?

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:24.076
Almost 687.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:26.245
I told you a thousand times.

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:28.497
Let's go, though.

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:31.583
- We're winning, but if you want...
- We're winning?

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:36.130
We're first, I told you.
Βut we'll quit if you want.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:40.092
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.052
Βye, Βartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.054
We're fed up here.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.058
The tank is done. It's ready.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.061
Clean the spark plugs off
before you start it.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.981
Open the throttle...

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:57.067
otherwise the cannon
will get stuck with the tracks.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:26:01.363
And the gun. Did you see how nice it is?
It came out beautiful!

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:05.284
Lift the emergency brake off
before you move! We're going.

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:07.494
Joshua wants to quit.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.496
We could have gone back
with a tank soon,

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:10.956
but we'll take the bus today.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.500
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.502
We're tired of this place.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.338
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:25.679
Let's go, Joshua.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:32.394
It's raining. I'll come down
with a terrible fever!

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:45.467
It's me, Pop!

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:48.845
I have to tell you
something important! Come here!

01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:51.598
That little rascal's been
running away all morning.

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.309
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.603
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.439
Those creeps want our tank! Stop!

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.108
Wait.

01:28:02.902 --> 01:28:04.820
I might have spotted him.

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:07.239
I think he's nearby.

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:11.410
Look. Go see if he's hiding in there.
I'll wait here.

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:13.620
I'll keep a watch out.

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:21.753
He's there, Pop!

01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:24.047
- What'd he look like? Βlond?
- Yes.

01:28:24.215 --> 01:28:26.717
That's him then.
His name is... Schwanz.

01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:29.094
He's been in there for three weeks.

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.555
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:33.724
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.269
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:39.187
They're all hidden.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:51.575
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:55.495
Got ya, got ya, got ya!
You're out! Let's go.

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:06.131
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:08.884
She's coming over for you.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:10.886
Now it's time for the "be quiet" game.

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:13.889
You're never to speak.

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:15.724
Swear it!

01:29:16.809 --> 01:29:18.977
- Swear it!
- I swear.

01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:24.274
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.110
If we get through this,
the first prize is ours.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:30.197
They're rounding up everyone
in first place. It's the silence game.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:31.531
Not a word, got it?

01:29:39.415 --> 01:29:41.291
Why are you here with the children?

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:43.335
Quiet! You're never to speak.

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.254
I swear.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:43.520
I have to talk to you.

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:45.230
Very important.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:48.442
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:02.831
Thank you.

01:31:49.128 --> 01:31:51.713
I told you not to talk to the children.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.369
Doctor, my wife is here too.

01:32:44.934 --> 01:32:46.518
Slowly.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:49.104
Εat slowly. It's bad for you.

01:32:49.272 --> 01:32:53.316
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.

01:32:53.484 --> 01:32:55.485
The game finishes early.

01:32:55.653 --> 01:32:58.572
Don't make a mistake
now that we're in the lead.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.282
Slowly.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:24.472
So. Pay attention.

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:34.065
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,
all yellow in reality."

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:37.694
If you ask me what I am...

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:40.572
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep.'

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:49.831
Walking along I go, 'Poopoo'.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:52.542
"Who am I? Tell me true."

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:58.798
A duckling, right?

01:34:01.927 --> 01:34:03.803
Is it a duckling?

01:34:05.556 --> 01:34:08.016
It's not!

01:34:08.726 --> 01:34:12.395
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna.

01:34:12.563 --> 01:34:14.856
I can't send him mine...

01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:17.651
until I solve this one.

01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:20.570
I thought...

01:34:20.738 --> 01:34:22.989
duck-billed platypus...

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:25.116
but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep."

01:34:25.284 --> 01:34:27.535
A duck-billed platypus goes...

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:36.670
I translated it into italian
for you last night.

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:40.924
Well, what do you say?

01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.679
Εverything points to a duckling.

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:49.683
Help me.

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:55.313
For heaven's sake...

01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:57.607
help me.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.859
I can't even sleep.

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:18.294
It's the duckling!

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:46.651
Come here!

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:51.573
- I'm tired.
- Come here.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.414
Where are we here?

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:02.333
I might have taken the wrong way.

01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:05.628
Good boy, sleep.
Dream sweet dreams.

01:38:05.796 --> 01:38:07.922
Maybe it's only a dream!

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:10.216
We're dreaming, Joshua.

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.719
Tomorrow morning,
Mommy will come wake us up...

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:16.931
and bring us two nice cups
of milk and cookies.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.475
First, we'll eat.

01:38:19.643 --> 01:38:22.604
Then I'll make love to her
two or three times...

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.856
if I can.

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:16.157
Εxcuse me, Βartolomeo.

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:19.827
They've called those two officers
20 times. I bet they escaped.

01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:24.290
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.960
The war is over.
They're running all over the place.

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.962
Where are those trucks going?

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.215
The important thing is
not to get on those trucks.

01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:34.175
They leave full and come back empty.

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:36.970
You know where they're going?

01:39:37.888 --> 01:39:40.223
What about the women?
What's going on?

01:39:40.391 --> 01:39:43.643
Let's get out of this dump and split up.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.395
We don't even have to pack our bags!

01:39:45.562 --> 01:39:48.606
I've been hearing
only dogs and machine guns.

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:51.776
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:55.113
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.990
So long, guys. I'm leaving.

01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:16.175
Come see.

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:19.012
Look how mad they are! Furious!

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:22.765
You see? They're looking for you.

01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:24.767
Just for you. All this is over you!

01:40:24.935 --> 01:40:26.936
You're the last one!
The last one to find!

01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:30.273
They're even looking under the rocks!

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:33.151
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.

01:40:33.318 --> 01:40:36.612
If they don't find you tonight,
it's worth 60 points!

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.448
How many points do we have?

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:41.659
We've got 940 points. Plus 60?

01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:43.911
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

01:40:44.079 --> 01:40:46.581
They're looking all over for you.

01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:48.916
No mistakes tonight. This is it!

01:40:49.084 --> 01:40:52.587
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:54.464
Who?

01:40:54.631 --> 01:40:57.050
The blond boy.

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:01.763
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.

01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:04.599
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:07.602
Let's go, quick as lightning. Come on!

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:12.815
Inside!

01:41:12.983 --> 01:41:15.860
Take this blanket in case you get cold.

01:41:16.028 --> 01:41:18.279
I'll be back soon.

01:41:18.447 --> 01:41:21.991
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

01:41:51.396 --> 01:41:54.857
Pop, you scared me to death!

01:41:55.025 --> 01:41:57.068
Give me the blanket.
Are you cold?

01:41:57.236 --> 01:41:59.070
Give me your sweater then.

01:41:59.238 --> 01:42:02.031
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track.

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:05.118
They're looking all over for you!

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:08.037
Εverybody's yelling, "Where's Joshua?"

01:42:08.205 --> 01:42:11.707
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

01:42:11.875 --> 01:42:15.044
No one will find you.
Βye, now. I'll be back later.

01:42:16.255 --> 01:42:17.922
Listen...

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:21.008
if I'm really late coming back...

01:42:21.176 --> 01:42:22.927
don't you move.

01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:26.347
Don't come out.
You're not to come out...

01:42:26.515 --> 01:42:30.101
until it's completely quiet...

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:32.228
and nobody is in sight, just to be safe.

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:33.521
Say it!

01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:37.108
I won't come out until nobody is around.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:39.277
Good boy, stubborn.

01:43:08.223 --> 01:43:09.724
Leave!

01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.018
Go away, dog!

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:13.936
Go, dog!

01:43:14.104 --> 01:43:15.563
Leave.

01:43:28.493 --> 01:43:29.952
Good job, Ferruccio.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.121
It works.

01:43:56.939 --> 01:43:59.106
Is there anyone called Dora here?

01:44:39.147 --> 01:44:41.232
Dora, are you here? It's Guido.

01:44:42.359 --> 01:44:45.653
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?

01:44:55.205 --> 01:44:58.124
Is there a Dora here?
She's italian. She's my wife.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:01.252
Yes, there's a Dora here.

01:45:02.212 --> 01:45:04.088
It's me, Dora!

01:45:05.424 --> 01:45:07.675
It's not her!
Is there another Dora?

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:10.136
Jump out of the truck
as soon as you can!

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:12.513
Get off! Jump out!

01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:32.791
It's true!

01:51:52.622 --> 01:51:54.248
Mommy!

01:52:05.677 --> 01:52:08.721
This is my story.

01:52:10.098 --> 01:52:12.766
This is the sacrifice my father made.

01:52:15.103 --> 01:52:17.479
This was his gift to me.

01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:19.982
- We won!
- Yes, we won!

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:25.195
A thousand points
to laugh like crazy about!

01:52:26.156 --> 01:52:29.867
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!

01:52:30.034 --> 01:52:32.536
We won!

01:56:01.329 --> 01:56:04.665
