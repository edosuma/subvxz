WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.304
I'm just gonna run to the
store and get a few things.

00:04.306 --> 00:05.339
I'll pick you up
when you're done.

00:05.341 --> 00:06.790
Okay.

00:06.792 --> 00:09.665
I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

00:09.666 --> 00:10.864
Hey, Sheldon.

00:10.866 --> 00:12.700
Hello. I'm here for my haircut

00:12.702 --> 00:14.034
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:14.036 --> 00:15.970
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's
in the hospital.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.171
He's pretty sick.

00:17.173 --> 00:21.008
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

00:21.010 --> 00:23.578
Why do these things
always happen to me?

00:24.379 --> 00:25.563
I can cut it for you.

00:25.565 --> 00:27.448
You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.351
I get my hair cut
by Mr. D'Onofrio.

00:30.353 --> 00:31.652
You believe
this guy?

00:33.555 --> 00:34.888
Excuse us for a second.

00:34.890 --> 00:36.407
Sheldon, it's okay,
he can do it.

00:36.409 --> 00:37.525
He's a barber.

00:37.527 --> 00:40.328
He's not a barber,
he's the nephew.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.862
He's an example
of the kind

00:41.864 --> 00:45.166
of nepotism that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

00:45.168 --> 00:46.834
Besides, Mr.
D'Onofrio knows

00:46.836 --> 00:49.403
exactly how I like my
hair done because he has

00:49.405 --> 00:52.607
all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

00:52.609 --> 00:54.408
What are you talking about?

00:54.410 --> 00:55.543
When I first
moved here,

00:55.545 --> 00:58.179
I was nervous about
finding a new barber,

00:58.181 --> 01:00.097
so my mother had all
my haircut records

01:00.099 --> 01:02.249
sent here to
Mr. D'Onofrio.

01:03.251 --> 01:06.721
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

01:06.723 --> 01:09.523
Yes, there are.

01:09.525 --> 01:10.725
Have you ever seen them?

01:10.727 --> 01:13.294
No, but my mother assured
me they were sent here,

01:13.296 --> 01:15.112
and I'll bet you
dollars to donuts

01:15.114 --> 01:16.714
that this one
doesn't have them.

01:17.282 --> 01:18.549
Uh, excuse me.

01:18.551 --> 01:21.152
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

01:21.154 --> 01:22.787
Your what?

01:22.789 --> 01:24.605
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,

01:24.607 --> 01:26.123
this is the way
the world ends--

01:26.125 --> 01:29.126
not with a bang
but with a nephew.

01:30.329 --> 01:33.381
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional,

01:33.383 --> 01:37.301
and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.119
Just sit down

01:39.121 --> 01:40.137
and let him do it.

01:40.139 --> 01:41.789
Fine, but if I come
out of this

01:41.791 --> 01:43.774
looking like a dork,
it's on you.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.485 --> 01:54.185
So my kid said
the funniest thing today.

01:54.187 --> 01:55.269
Nope.

01:59.324 --> 02:01.659
When you tell this story later,

out of my eyes.

02:49.798 --> 02:50.656
Sheldon,

02:50.657 --> 02:53.191
you are one day late
for your haircut.

02:53.193 --> 02:55.877
Thank you for captioning
my nightmare.

02:57.729 --> 03:00.331
Lookie here,
I got my travel orders.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.035
"Payload Specialist Howard
Wolowitz is requested

03:04.037 --> 03:06.737
"to report to the NASA
Johnson Space Center,

03:06.739 --> 03:07.839
"Houston, Texas,

03:07.841 --> 03:10.008
for astronaut training
Monday 8:00 a.m."

03:10.010 --> 03:13.011
Yeah, but it's from NASA,
so it's 0800.

03:13.013 --> 03:14.762
But it says
"8:00 a.m""

03:16.181 --> 03:18.416
You read it as "0800."

03:18.418 --> 03:20.518
It doesn't have an
"O" in front of it.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.221
You know what does have
an "oh" in front of it?

03:23.223 --> 03:26.074
"Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,
and you're dying of jealousy."

03:28.093 --> 03:29.360
So, what kind of
things are they...?

03:29.362 --> 03:31.929
Will you stop that?

03:31.931 --> 03:36.417
I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.937
You know, Sheldon,
I used to cut my brother's hair.

03:39.939 --> 03:40.938
I could do it for you.

03:40.940 --> 03:43.908
Penny, I know you mean well,

03:43.910 --> 03:46.794
offering the skills
of the hill folk, but, um,

03:46.796 --> 03:48.579
here in town,

03:48.581 --> 03:50.498
we don't churn our own butter,

03:50.500 --> 03:52.667
we don't make dresses
out of gunny sacks,

03:52.669 --> 03:55.136
and, uh, we sure as shootin'
don't get our hair cut

03:55.138 --> 03:56.137
by bottle-blonde...

03:56.139 --> 03:58.022
Sheldon, be nice.

03:58.024 --> 04:00.591
I'm sorry,
it's the bad boy attitude

04:00.593 --> 04:01.976
that comes with this hair.

04:05.797 --> 04:06.814
You could go to my guy.

04:06.816 --> 04:08.683
He's at Juan-Juan
in Beverly Hills.

04:08.685 --> 04:10.735
They bring you a cup of tea,
they'll massage your scalp.

04:10.737 --> 04:13.804
It's about $200, but sometimes
you look in the next chair

04:13.806 --> 04:17.190
and you see a superstar
like Tony Danza.

04:19.312 --> 04:21.329
Have we actually changed
the conversation

04:21.331 --> 04:22.864
from "I'm going
to astronaut training"

04:22.866 --> 04:25.649
to "Sheldon can't
get a haircut"?

04:25.651 --> 04:26.801
Now who's dying of jealousy?

04:26.803 --> 04:30.288
"Oh," it's you.

you're ruining girlfriend-

04:55.248 --> 04:57.515
I'm sorry.

04:57.517 --> 05:00.735
I'm looking for a barber
and I'm running out of time.

05:00.737 --> 05:01.836
My hair is growing at the rate

05:01.838 --> 05:05.239
of 4.6 yoctometers
per femtosecond.

05:06.108 --> 05:08.876
I mean, if you're quiet,
you can hear it.

05:09.694 --> 05:12.530
What about Supercuts?

05:12.532 --> 05:13.531
I tried once.

05:13.533 --> 05:14.849
They do men's and women's hair

05:14.851 --> 05:17.251
in the same room
at the same time.

05:17.253 --> 05:20.221
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
with mousse.

05:20.223 --> 05:22.807
Well, this isn't
a crisis.

05:22.809 --> 05:24.926
Why don't you just let
your hair grow out a little?

05:24.928 --> 05:26.043
Why don't I let

05:26.045 --> 05:27.161
my hair grow out?

05:27.163 --> 05:29.797
Um, why don't I start
wearing Birkenstocks

05:29.799 --> 05:32.817
and seeking validation
of my opinions by asking

05:32.819 --> 05:34.368
"Can you dig it?"

05:34.370 --> 05:37.038
Well, I don't know.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.173
I think you might look
sexy with long hair.

05:40.409 --> 05:43.161
The kind that flows down
to your shoulders

05:43.163 --> 05:46.614
and blows back
while riding on a horse.

05:48.717 --> 05:51.352
Bareback and bare-chested.

05:53.622 --> 05:56.374
I'm gonna go brush my teeth;
it might take a while.

06:01.413 --> 06:02.547
Hi.

06:02.549 --> 06:03.948
Hi, sweetie.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.149
I miss you.

06:05.151 --> 06:06.717
I miss you, too.

06:06.719 --> 06:09.303
So tell me
all about your first day.

06:09.305 --> 06:11.789
Oh, wow, where do I even start?

06:11.791 --> 06:15.109
I got to experience
zero gravity.

06:15.111 --> 06:16.394
Cool. How do they do that?

06:16.396 --> 06:17.395
It's pretty neat.

06:17.397 --> 06:18.629
You get in this plane

06:18.631 --> 06:22.650
that goes almost straight up
for, like, 20 seconds,

06:22.652 --> 06:27.288
and then straight back down
like it's going to crash, and

06:27.290 --> 06:28.573
they do it

06:28.575 --> 06:30.575
over and over again, you know,

06:30.577 --> 06:32.776
no matter how many times
you throw up.

06:32.778 --> 06:34.612
You threw up?

06:34.614 --> 06:38.166
Yeah... and the craziest part
is, because there's no gravity,

06:38.168 --> 06:42.920
the throw-up kind of
floats there...

06:42.922 --> 06:44.121
in a little ball,

06:44.123 --> 06:45.606
and

06:45.608 --> 06:49.143
if your mouth is open
because you're screaming...

06:50.712 --> 06:53.898
...sometimes it just floats
right back in.

06:57.135 --> 07:00.354
Boy, does everyone laugh
at you when that happens.

07:00.356 --> 07:01.355
That sounds mean.

07:01.357 --> 07:02.406
No.

07:02.408 --> 07:03.908
Yeah, I would have laughed, too,

07:03.910 --> 07:06.077
but I didn't want the vomit
to come back out.

07:09.115 --> 07:11.082
Anyway...

07:11.084 --> 07:12.983
Oh, could you do me a favor

07:12.985 --> 07:16.337
and overnight me
some more underwear?

07:16.339 --> 07:17.655
Sure, why?

07:17.657 --> 07:19.040
I got a look at the centrifuge

07:19.042 --> 07:20.741
they're going to spin me
around in tomorrow,

07:20.743 --> 07:23.110
and I have a hunch
I packed a little light.

07:31.186 --> 07:33.854
Mr. D'Onofrio?

07:33.856 --> 07:35.640
It's Sheldon.

07:36.475 --> 07:38.392
They didn't have
anything barber-themed

07:38.394 --> 07:42.146
in the gift shop,
so I got you this.

07:42.148 --> 07:44.181
I don't know if you can read
his little T-shirt.

07:44.183 --> 07:47.201
It says, um,
"Get well bear-y soon."

07:48.787 --> 07:50.955
Trust me, if you were even
a little conscious right now,

07:50.957 --> 07:51.989
you'd be laughing.

07:54.910 --> 07:58.212
Anyway...

07:58.214 --> 08:02.883
There's new studies that show,
people in comas are aware

08:02.885 --> 08:05.202
of everything going on
around them.

08:05.204 --> 08:08.256
With that in mind,
if you can hear me,

08:08.258 --> 08:10.174
move away from the light

08:10.176 --> 08:13.978
and toward the sound
of these scissors.

08:15.064 --> 08:16.731
Can I help you?

08:16.733 --> 08:17.982
Yes.

08:17.984 --> 08:21.936
Do you have something
I could use as a cape?

08:21.938 --> 08:24.555
Oh, dear,
did we spit out our pills,

08:24.557 --> 08:28.159
slip out of the ninth floor,
and go on a little adventure?

08:28.161 --> 08:30.161
Oh, no,

08:30.163 --> 08:33.230
no, I'm just here
to get my hair cut.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.952
I-I see.

08:37.953 --> 08:40.921
J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.

08:40.923 --> 08:42.957
Security!

08:42.958 --> 08:45.576
I got to run.

08:45.578 --> 08:48.796
But not with scissors--
that would be unsafe.

08:57.919 --> 09:02.238
So, if I move
my horsey here...

09:04.124 --> 09:07.243
...isn't that checkmate
and I win?

09:13.601 --> 09:15.351
Hmm.

09:16.153 --> 09:19.055
Well, is it
or isn't it?

09:20.090 --> 09:22.959
You know, I think this is
a good stopping point.

09:23.928 --> 09:25.895
Uh, it's your
first real game.

09:25.897 --> 09:27.730
I threw a lot
of information at you.

09:27.732 --> 09:28.898
Well, no,

09:28.900 --> 09:30.266
I mean,
your king is trapped.

09:30.268 --> 09:33.069
He can't go here
because of my lighthouse,

09:33.071 --> 09:35.771
and...

09:35.773 --> 09:39.909
he can't go here because
of my pointy-head guy.

09:40.794 --> 09:43.746
Like I said, complicated game.

09:43.748 --> 09:45.965
So did I win or not?

09:45.967 --> 09:47.250
Did you have fun?

09:47.252 --> 09:49.052
Because if you had fun,
then you are, you are a winner.

09:49.054 --> 09:51.337
That's, that-that's
what chess is all about.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.007
Hello.

09:54.009 --> 09:55.008
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.392
Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.
Eh, why?

09:56.394 --> 10:00.280
My spot, your spot--
what difference does it make?

10:03.767 --> 10:06.269
Okay, what just happened?

10:06.271 --> 10:07.637
I don't know.

10:07.639 --> 10:09.739
Between you playing chess
like Bobby Fischer

10:09.741 --> 10:12.692
and Sheldon being okay
with you in his spot,

10:12.694 --> 10:15.078
I'm guessing someone went
back in time, stepped on a bug,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.647
and changed the course
of human events.

10:18.482 --> 10:21.000
Uh, sweetie,
are you all right?

10:21.002 --> 10:23.503
No, I'm not all right.

10:23.505 --> 10:26.205
It's been six days since I
was supposed to get a haircut

10:26.207 --> 10:28.625
and nothing horrible
has happened.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.678
Okay, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.296
Leonard, explain it to her.

10:33.298 --> 10:36.466
Oh, uh, he's crazy.

10:37.635 --> 10:39.352
I have spent my whole life

10:39.354 --> 10:41.554
trying to bring order
to the universe

10:41.556 --> 10:44.507
by carefully planning
every moment of every day.

10:44.509 --> 10:45.675
But all my efforts--

10:45.677 --> 10:48.111
our dinner schedule,
my pajama rotation,

10:48.113 --> 10:50.346
my bowel movement spreadsheet--

10:50.348 --> 10:52.848
it's clear now,

10:52.850 --> 10:54.651
I've been wasting my time.

10:54.653 --> 10:58.988
Good. I'm taking that
disgusting chart off the fridge.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.541
You know, Sh-Sheldon,

11:01.543 --> 11:03.293
sometimes it's nice
not knowing what's coming.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.627
I mean, look at me and Leonard.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.829
We went out, we broke up,
now we're trying again.

11:06.831 --> 11:08.197
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

11:08.199 --> 11:11.050
Oh, please, everyone knows
what's going to happen.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.704
But I see your point.

11:14.706 --> 11:16.339
I think this could
be good for you.

11:16.341 --> 11:18.925
Maybe it's time for you
to shake things up a bit.

11:18.927 --> 11:21.094
You're right.

11:21.096 --> 11:23.346
I should embrace the chaos.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.098
Great.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.566
What are you going
to do first?

11:26.568 --> 11:27.600
I don't know.

11:27.602 --> 11:29.068
I could do anything.

11:29.070 --> 11:31.070
All bets are off.

11:31.072 --> 11:34.524
The world is my oyster.

11:34.526 --> 11:35.875
I got it.

11:35.877 --> 11:39.245
I'm going to put
on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

11:43.701 --> 11:46.285
I got to tell you,
I'm a little worried about him.

11:46.287 --> 11:48.121
If I were you, I'd be
worried that a girl

11:48.123 --> 11:51.407
who's never played chess in
her life just kicked your ass.

12:04.371 --> 12:06.873
Hi.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.008
Howie, what happened to you?

12:09.010 --> 12:12.945
We did overnight survival
training in the wilderness.

12:12.947 --> 12:14.697
Big fun.

12:14.699 --> 12:17.533
Big, big fun.

12:17.535 --> 12:20.153
I was gonna freshen up for you

12:20.155 --> 12:24.307
but I blacked out a little
on the way to the bathroom.

12:25.743 --> 12:26.826
Survival training?

12:26.828 --> 12:27.943
Is that like camping?

12:27.945 --> 12:28.995
Uh-huh.

12:28.997 --> 12:31.731
Except you don't
have food or water,

12:31.733 --> 12:35.234
and they don't have
a sunset Sabbath service

12:35.236 --> 12:38.254
like they do
at Camp Hess-Kramer.

12:38.256 --> 12:40.807
Do you sleep in tents?

12:40.809 --> 12:41.958
No.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.460
I slept in a hole

12:44.462 --> 12:48.431
I dug in the ground
with my bare hands.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.868
And at some point
during the night,

12:51.870 --> 12:55.338
an armadillo crawled in

12:55.340 --> 12:57.940
and spooned me.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.360
Poor baby.

13:01.362 --> 13:02.495
But I did it.

13:02.497 --> 13:04.414
I survived.

13:04.416 --> 13:08.935
I wasn't sure I was going to
when the sandstorm hit.

13:08.937 --> 13:12.672
I just pulled my turtleneck
up over my head

13:12.674 --> 13:16.342
and waited for death.

13:16.344 --> 13:20.129
But somehow as I sat there,

13:20.131 --> 13:24.500
wrapped in a cocoon
of my own neck-sweat,

13:24.502 --> 13:29.288
I found that primal part
of the human spirit

13:29.290 --> 13:33.342
that just wants
to keep on living,

13:33.344 --> 13:36.078
no matter what the cost.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.396
You're so brave.

13:37.398 --> 13:39.065
I'm proud of you.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.752
I ate a butterfly.

13:49.326 --> 13:52.345
It was so small and...

13:52.347 --> 13:54.747
beautiful,

13:54.749 --> 13:57.467
but I was so hungry.

14:00.804 --> 14:02.889
Are you crying?

14:02.891 --> 14:05.708
No, I don't think it's possible.

14:05.710 --> 14:09.212
I'm severely dehydrated.

14:09.214 --> 14:12.799
My pee is like toothpaste.

14:12.801 --> 14:16.686
Howie, if you're not able
to do this, come home.

14:16.688 --> 14:19.722
It won't change
how I feel about you.

14:19.724 --> 14:22.742
Thanks, honey, but I can't quit.

14:22.744 --> 14:25.828
If I do, I'll just be a guy

14:25.830 --> 14:29.832
who had a chance to be an
astronaut and gave it up.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.067
Well, is there anything
I could do to help?

14:32.069 --> 14:34.170
No.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.338
Wait.

14:35.340 --> 14:39.275
Send more underwear.

14:48.118 --> 14:51.521
Don't let this
be Sheldon playing bongos.

15:06.620 --> 15:10.389
Hello, Leonard,
do you like my bongos?

15:11.792 --> 15:15.110
Bet you didn't know
that I had bongos.

15:16.330 --> 15:18.280
Sheldon, it's 3:00 o'clock
in the morning.

15:18.282 --> 15:19.448
3:00 in the morning

15:19.450 --> 15:23.285
is a good time for bongos.

15:23.287 --> 15:24.887
I was sleeping.

15:24.889 --> 15:28.123
Leonard sleeps
while I play bongos.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.561
No, he doesn't.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.347
Leonard no sleep
while I play bongos.

15:34.349 --> 15:36.465
Bongo solo.

15:40.737 --> 15:42.104
Stop! Stop it!

15:42.106 --> 15:44.240
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

15:49.279 --> 15:51.664
- What the hell?!
- Oh, hi,

15:51.666 --> 15:52.815
Penny, guess what?

15:52.817 --> 15:55.001
Sheldon got bongos.

15:55.003 --> 15:56.619
Why did you get bongos?

15:56.621 --> 15:58.487
Richard Feynman
played the bongos.

15:58.489 --> 15:59.922
I thought I'd give that a try.

15:59.924 --> 16:01.657
Richard Feynman
was a famous physicist.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.325
Oh, Leonard, it's 3:00 o'clock
in the morning.

16:03.327 --> 16:05.211
I don't care if Richard Feynman
was a purple leprechaun

16:05.213 --> 16:07.179
who lived in my butt.

16:08.131 --> 16:11.217
Penny meant if he were
a purple leprechaun.

16:11.219 --> 16:12.334
Penny forgot

16:12.336 --> 16:14.520
to use the subjunctive.

16:15.522 --> 16:18.173
Sheldon, go to bed.

16:18.175 --> 16:19.692
You have work in the morning.

16:19.694 --> 16:20.943
Maybe, maybe not.

16:20.945 --> 16:23.846
Maybe tomorrow I start
a bongo band and tour the world.

16:25.282 --> 16:28.200
No, no, hang on,
uh, uh,

16:28.202 --> 16:29.518
Roommate Agreement.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.622
No hootenannies, sing-a-longs,
or barbershop quartets

16:32.624 --> 16:35.041
after 10:00 p.m.

16:35.043 --> 16:36.242
Roommate Agreement?

16:36.244 --> 16:37.359
Are you kidding?

16:37.361 --> 16:38.661
We are living in a world

16:38.663 --> 16:40.630
of chaos.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.648
Roommate Agreement.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.835
Where are you going?

16:45.837 --> 16:48.037
Wherever the music
takes me, kitten.

16:51.008 --> 16:52.925
I play bongos

16:52.927 --> 16:54.060
walking down the stairs.

16:54.062 --> 16:57.480
Oh! Oh!

16:59.683 --> 17:03.719
Never play bongos
walking down the stairs.

17:09.492 --> 17:10.608
Surprise.

17:10.611 --> 17:12.444
What are you doing here?

17:12.446 --> 17:14.163
I'm here to help you
get through this.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.332
You can't do it on your own,
you need someone

17:16.334 --> 17:17.583
to take care of you.

17:17.585 --> 17:18.884
Oh, I love you so much.

17:18.886 --> 17:20.202
Oh, I love you.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.589
Howard,
your bath is getting cold!

17:25.709 --> 17:28.094
Don't worry, once
she falls asleep,

17:28.096 --> 17:30.846
I'll spoon you
like an armadillo.

17:35.052 --> 17:39.138
He showed up in the middle
of the night with his bongos.

17:39.140 --> 17:43.092
I foolishly thought it was some
sort of musical booty call.

17:44.111 --> 17:46.128
Poor guy.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.898
He must have been exhausted.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.734
Sheldon like to sleep
while Leonard play the bongo!

17:54.270 --> 17:56.455
That was kind of uncalled for.

17:56.457 --> 17:57.940
No, it was called for.

17:59.076 --> 18:00.626
What's going on?

18:00.628 --> 18:01.627
All right, Sheldon,

18:01.629 --> 18:03.129
this craziness
has gone on long enough.

18:03.131 --> 18:05.414
Please come home
so I can cut your hair.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.750
Penny, you're not trained.

18:07.752 --> 18:09.251
You're not licensed.

18:09.253 --> 18:13.222
Most importantly, you don't have
access to my haircut records.

18:16.059 --> 18:18.044
All right, honey, look,

18:18.046 --> 18:20.396
we've known each other
for a long time now, right?

18:20.398 --> 18:22.798
I've taken you to Disneyland,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.934
I kicked a bully
in the nuts for you,

18:24.936 --> 18:26.936
I sing you "Soft Kitty"

18:26.938 --> 18:28.938
when you're sick,

18:28.940 --> 18:30.523
you've even saw me naked once.

18:30.525 --> 18:33.676
I'm sorry,
what?

18:33.678 --> 18:35.644
It was a long story.

18:35.646 --> 18:37.980
Anyway, Sheldon, I promise
I know what I'm doing.

18:37.982 --> 18:39.532
Please let me cut your hair.

18:39.534 --> 18:42.535
Amy, what do you think?

18:42.537 --> 18:46.321
There's not a hair on my body
I wouldn't let this woman trim.

18:54.714 --> 18:56.849
Fine, let's go.

19:00.303 --> 19:02.221
Thank you for letting me
sleep on your couch.

19:02.223 --> 19:04.006
There's only so many times
a woman can say,

19:04.008 --> 19:05.357
"How about the bed?"

19:08.645 --> 19:11.180
What's this
about Sheldon seeing you naked?

19:11.182 --> 19:15.034
Oh, relax. It was just
her bottom and her breasts.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.152
Almost done.

19:27.154 --> 19:28.954
At the end of the haircut,

19:28.956 --> 19:32.324
Mr. D'Onofrio
would tell me a dirty joke.

19:32.326 --> 19:35.928
Sorry, I don't know
any dirty jokes.

19:35.930 --> 19:39.281
That's okay,
I never understood them anyway.

19:41.217 --> 19:43.385
Okay, what do you think?

19:45.438 --> 19:48.023
Hm, well,

19:48.025 --> 19:50.959
it's a little Hollywood.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.296
But I think
I can pull it off.

19:54.298 --> 19:55.631
Well done, Penny.

19:55.633 --> 19:56.848
Ha, told you.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.700
Okay, I'm just gonna clean up
your neck a little

19:58.702 --> 20:01.787
and then you are good to go.
Fun time.

20:02.873 --> 20:05.791
Sorry, sometimes the clippers
tickle me.

20:05.793 --> 20:07.326
Okay.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.885
Okay, yep, we're all done now.

20:16.887 --> 20:17.869
It's just... it's good.

20:17.871 --> 20:20.422
Let me just take that
away from you.

20:20.424 --> 20:22.090
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

20:22.092 --> 20:24.259
You are welcome.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.999
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.
