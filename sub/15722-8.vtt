WEBVTT

00:11.480 --> 00:13.680
You better have
a hell of a good story.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.200
Someone, somewhere,
somehow got creative.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.520
Holy shit.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.920
Who's the asshole who
ruined NorBAC's reputation?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.280
Wasn't me.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.800
Who was it 'cause that's where
I'm going next with a baseball bat.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.040
I didn't send him to Florida, David.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.440
Charringa knew there was
a fastidiosa bug on the way

00:30.520 --> 00:32.240
so he decided to do
a pre-emptive vaccination

00:32.400 --> 00:34.080
on his orange groves in Florida.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.280
- Okay, wait a minute. He had a vaccine?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.760
No, these people have
been using an engineered version

00:38.880 --> 00:41.880
of fastidiosa as a vaccination on
their grapes in California for 3 years.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.360
You think Charringa did this to himself?

00:44.480 --> 00:45.880
I don't think, I know.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.280
Owen.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.840
What are you doing here?

00:49.920 --> 00:51.800
I got rid of the weed, and now,

00:51.960 --> 00:54.120
the 2 guys who own the weed,
well, they want to kill me.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
- What?
- Who?

00:55.520 --> 00:57.720
Look, I just need
a place for a bit.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.000
LET ME DIE

00:59.160 --> 01:01.440
It's a decision
he's had a lot of time to make.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.720
Glenn...

01:04.720 --> 01:06.080
we're running.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.320
And...

01:08.640 --> 01:10.880
feel the leaves under our feet.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.360
We're in a forest.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.520
We're just going

01:17.920 --> 01:21.800
so fast now that
the wind is pinching our ears.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.520
And...

01:23.760 --> 01:26.160
and our eyes are watering.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.720
We can't even feel our cheeks anymore.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.640
Look up ahead.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.240
There's a...

01:33.600 --> 01:34.720
There's a...

01:37.080 --> 01:38.560
There's a meadow.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.160
Can you see it?

01:45.960 --> 01:48.000
Oh, now you can run.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.240 --> 02:15.080
What?

02:15.160 --> 02:17.200
Excuse me, sir,
would you mind turning off your engine?

02:17.320 --> 02:18.720
- What?
- You're idling.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.600
Yeah. Thanks, officer.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.960
Are you aware that greenhouse gases
caused by the burning of fossil fuels

02:24.120 --> 02:26.240
and biomasses are contributing
to atmospheric brown clouds

02:26.320 --> 02:28.440
that already threaten millions
of people all over the world?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.760
Looks pretty good to me.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.360
Sir, at this very moment,
a cloud of enormous proportions

02:33.560 --> 02:35.120
is heading towards Mexico City

02:35.440 --> 02:37.960
due to its unique
geographical location.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.440
No shit.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.200
The cloud is being made
worse by greenhouse gases,

02:41.320 --> 02:43.200
such as the ones
emanating from your tailpipe.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.480
So, my tailpipe is
messing up Mexico City?

02:45.560 --> 02:48.240
Yes. Furthermore,
tremors have been detected

02:48.440 --> 02:50.200
in the nearby
Popocatepetl Mountain.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.120
Carlos.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.200
Ah, this is it?

03:10.280 --> 03:12.160
Caroline will fill you in.
She's up in her office.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.720
Okay, I will get David.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.680
- David.
- Hmm?

03:18.840 --> 03:19.920
It's here.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.000
Any idea what this is all about?
What's in here?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.200
No idea.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.760
Good morning.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.120
How're things going with Owen?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.440
Uh... You mean is he still around?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.200
Yup, he's still around.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.400
2.08 - Haze

05:03.000 --> 05:05.280
Owen? Is that the kid
from the subway?

05:05.360 --> 05:08.080
Yeah. Showed up at my place.
Cold, hungry, and broke.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.960
I told him to go away.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.280
- You're so good with kids...
- Aren't I?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.760
She usually doesn't lock it.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.120
Caroline?

05:26.280 --> 05:27.640
Just a minute.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.440
Oh. Just arrived?

05:35.640 --> 05:37.240
Yeah. Couple of minutes ago.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.200
- You not gonna lock it, are ya?
- Didn't realize I had.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.120
So, what are we looking at?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.800
Homeland Security has been
keeping a close watch on 2 brothers.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.080
Scientists.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.640
Stefan and Vincent Manford.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.320
Any particular reason?

06:01.440 --> 06:04.360
They've been ordering viral DNA
for their lab in Chicago.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.680
- Private lab?
- Yes. Just the 2 of them.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.160
So they've been ordering
viral DNA. So what?

06:09.320 --> 06:11.720
That's what you need
if you're studying viruses, Caroline.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.440
There's more, David.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
Oh, how nice.
From Homeland Security,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.840
for all the good work
we've done, no doubt.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.760
No, the Manford brothers sent this
to the President of the United States.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.400
- Big fans?
- Not at all.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.320
They've been very verbal
about how much they dislike

06:30.400 --> 06:32.520
the way the President's
been handling U.S. affairs.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.320
Them and 75% of
the rest of the world.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.760
That's what got them on
Homeland Security's watch list.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.640
Whatever happened to
your constitutional right

06:38.800 --> 06:40.520
to speak out against your government?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.000
You can but if you're buying
viral DNA at the same time

06:43.120 --> 06:44.760
you end up on Homeland's radar.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.720
They're thinking these brothers
are involved in bioterrorism.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.880
Oh, let's just say,
they're not taking any chances.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.560
So Washington ran their own test.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.800
Looks like they took a little nip.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.880
They tested 250 milliliters.
They didn't find anything.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.520
- So what do they want us to do?
- They want us to confirm

07:01.600 --> 07:03.560
that there's just
Cabernet Sauvignon in the bottle.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.120
Pop the cork,
let's have a tasting party.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.040
Oh, cut the goddamn sarcasm,
David, and get to it.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.520
Absolutely, your Worship.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.280
Is there anything else
I can do for you today?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.360
- Maybe a foot massage?
- Just test the bottle,

07:13.480 --> 07:16.320
and then you're... No, we are going
to Chicago to take a look at their lab.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.200
- Take a look at their lab?
- I have my orders, David.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.000
Orders! Since when
did we join the fucking army?

07:22.160 --> 07:24.440
Orders. Jesus, this is bullshit!

07:29.720 --> 07:32.160
- Are you okay, Caroline?
- Yeah. I'm fine, I'm just tired.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.480
You've had a tough week?

07:35.760 --> 07:36.960
Yeah.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.000
We'll get right on this.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.120
Thank you, Carlos.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.200
Got 3 bull's-eyes and a pigeon.
You want a game?

07:56.520 --> 07:57.600
No.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.520
You know, this is
a difficult time for her.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.880
You know, it's a difficult time
for all of us, Carlos.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.800
Ok, I'm sorry about her nephew...
Glenn. I'm sorry about Glenn.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.360
I'm sorry I had to hear about it
second-goddamn-hand from Bob.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.200
She kept it very personal.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.280
She should keep her nervous breakdown
personal, too and not take it out on me, then.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.920
I just think if you were a little bit--

08:16.040 --> 08:18.480
Just do what the lady says
and check everything ok?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.680
The bottle, the wine,
the cork, the label,

08:20.840 --> 08:21.800
the fucking glue on the label,

08:21.880 --> 08:23.640
we'll bring in a wine expert,
find out where the grapes were from.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.960
Wine experts get it wrong
more often than not.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.080
Whatever, just go up
one side of it, down the other

08:27.120 --> 08:29.560
and leave the report in my underwear
drawer. I'll find it someday.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
What?

08:34.600 --> 08:35.960
I'll get on it.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.800
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.520
Why are you doing that?

09:13.560 --> 09:15.200
I heard about Glenn.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.240
Bob, I'm sorry.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.800
The cloud.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.080
It's still moving, Bob.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.920
- Are these the latest NOAA maps.
- Hmm-hmm. Just came in.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.360
See, it's closer.
The western-most tendril

09:29.440 --> 09:32.240
is already touching the coast.
It travelled a 100 kilometers overnight.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.880
I put together
a program of my own

09:33.960 --> 09:37.600
that downloads data from
the National Weather Service.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.680
So we've got NEXRAD radar,
air quality, satellite views,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.240
- speed, altitude...
- It's only at 5400 meters high?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.280
Down from 6500
before it hit the coast.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.360
We have to watch that if it goes down
any more... How fast is it moving?

09:47.760 --> 09:48.840
Well it varies.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.440
Satellite had it going as fast
as 55 kilometers an hour

09:51.640 --> 09:54.760
and then at a dead stop.
Right now, it's at 23 K.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.120
But still heading toward
Mexico City. Right?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.440
The NOAA hasn't given me
any models as to where it's going.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.040
Yeah, but looking at it.
It's heading toward Mexico City.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.760
I know, but Bob,
I'm not a climatologist.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.400
I know. I know.

10:04.760 --> 10:05.880
What about the mountain?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.400
The mountain, yeah.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.160
Here.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.400
- It just started this morning.
- It's happening.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.960
<i>It seems, yeah.
The Instituto Seismologico</i>

10:16.120 --> 10:19.400
is predicting a constant eruption
of gases over the next 24 to 36 hours...

10:19.640 --> 10:21.640
What are they doing?
Have they posted smog alerts?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.480
- Have they shut down the major industries?
- Posted alerts yes.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.520
But getting 18 million people

10:27.600 --> 10:30.320
- to respond isn't exactly...
- We need to get David on this.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.840
I have to show him this.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.600
Please, can you print it?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.200
I'll be at my desk.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.560
OK.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.960
Did David talk to you

10:44.760 --> 10:47.040
- about Owen?
- Not really.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.840
I told him he had to help him.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.080
Ah.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.720
I mean, he couldn't just
throw him out in the street, right?

10:53.880 --> 10:54.640
No.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.320
I think he's pissed off
at me for saying that.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.800
Why don't you talk to David about it?

11:02.280 --> 11:04.400
I guess I could talk to David.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.920
OK. I'll have to do a full run on these.

11:10.120 --> 11:10.880
OK.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.600
Now, you just want
a viral gene chip on the wine, right?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.720
- Check for all known bacteria.
- You got it.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.840
If you're going
to start giving me "orders",

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
you can do a little goddamn respect!

11:50.160 --> 11:52.360
and not like I'm some
kind of ass kissing subordinate!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.640
You always talk
to yourself like that?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.520
What the hell are you doing here?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.400
Let me in and I'll fill you in.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.920
How'd you get around back?

12:07.040 --> 12:09.720
It was easy. I mean,
a bit harder than Canadian Customs.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.600
Owen, I'm kind of busy right now.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.680
- Yeah, yeah, you look super busy.
- You need some money?

12:15.880 --> 12:18.120
No, I just stopped by
because I need some advice.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.560
Not from me, man.
I suck at advice.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.160
Look, David, I don't have
anybody else to talk to.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.040
And I mean, it appears
that you listen to me.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.160
Yeah, well...

12:29.360 --> 12:31.200
- I can't go back.
- Sure you can.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.640
I'll get you a bus ticket,
I'll get you a plane ticket.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.320
Going back to New York
is a good thing.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.960
- You'd be with your people.
- You don't understand.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.480
They'll fucking stick me.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.080
I dumped their dope.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.640
And that shit was worth, like,
half a million bucks on the street.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.720
It's good, because Sunshine
and everybody, they got better.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.040
David, I have something to
show you if you have the...

12:51.600 --> 12:52.760
Hey, Owen. What are you?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.200
- Where did you?
- What is it, Bob?

12:54.280 --> 12:57.080
Emissions from cars and factories,
trapped by the inversion layer,

12:57.160 --> 12:58.520
combined with the mass of pollution

12:58.600 --> 13:00.160
moving across the Pacific complicated

13:00.240 --> 13:02.200
by the gases emitting out
of Mount Popocatepetl.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.120
Theoretically, David,
we could be heading towards

13:05.320 --> 13:06.920
a perfect pollution storm
over Mexico City.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.480
What the hell
do you guys do here?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.560
OK, well you know the procedure.
Tell Caroline to contact Mexico

13:11.640 --> 13:13.520
and find out what
their story is and... What?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.600
- Mexico City is on the line.
- What?

13:15.680 --> 13:17.400
I need you on this call.
I need to convince them

13:17.560 --> 13:19.280
- that this disaster could happen.
- I can't help you here, Bob.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.120
- I'm not up to speed...
- David, please!

13:21.360 --> 13:23.200
Okay, all right.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.720
Get Carlos in on this,
I'll be down in a second.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.200
Excuse me.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.680
Look, Owen,

13:29.840 --> 13:33.200
I got a thing and
just go get yourself a...

13:33.600 --> 13:36.400
you know, a hat, and some lunch.
We'll talk later.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.920
Should I go back to your place?

13:38.080 --> 13:40.120
Yeah. Clean the toilets
if you don't mind.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.600
Yeah, thanks.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.920
Oh, Owen.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.800
If you can just, you know,
let yourself out the way you came in.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.960
This is where the NOAA and
other international weather agencies

13:56.040 --> 13:57.120
had it one week ago.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.200
All right.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.800
This is 3 days ago.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.160
Less than 3 hours ago.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.040
They're aware of the cloud...

14:11.120 --> 14:12.840
They don't think
it's going to be a problem.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.320
Well, alone it wouldn't be a problem.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.280
But it will still would be
unhealthy. And in combination

14:16.440 --> 14:19.080
with the gases emitting from the
mountain and the intense inversion layer

14:19.200 --> 14:22.520
over Mexico City, I believe they
can produce a very intense acid rain.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.120
Excuse me. Acid rain?

14:25.240 --> 14:27.080
- Specifically sulfuric acid.
- Sulfuric?

14:27.320 --> 14:28.840
You have data to support this?

14:28.920 --> 14:30.600
Right now it's purely theoretical but I...

14:30.680 --> 14:32.960
Based on this theoretical scenario,

14:33.200 --> 14:34.760
what is it
that you want us to do?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.240
Well, I thought that...

14:36.320 --> 14:38.360
This is a potentially very dangerous...

14:38.560 --> 14:39.880
People could die.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.640
This is a very toxic rain
that could destroy....

14:42.760 --> 14:44.000
It's got a destructive power.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.720
I think what Dr. Melnikov
is suggesting is that you need

14:46.840 --> 14:49.000
to intensify your efforts
to reduce emissions

14:49.080 --> 14:51.120
in your industry and
your transportation.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.960
Dr. Melnikov,
are you a climatologist?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.280
Biochemist, biophysicist.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.440
We've been consulting with
the NOAA and their climatologists.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.600
- And they agree with you?
- Not yet they're still...

14:59.720 --> 15:02.160
Dr. Melnikov, I am a climatologist.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.840
Are you familiar with the weather
patterns of central and southern Mexico?

15:05.920 --> 15:08.040
- To some degree.
- Wind patterns?

15:08.560 --> 15:09.160
No.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.840
So wind patterns have not
been formulated into your theory?

15:12.520 --> 15:14.120
My theory is based on the data.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.200
The mountain gases combining with...

15:24.280 --> 15:26.440
They think we're overstating our case.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.680
No, listen. Even if
the jet stream were to blow through

15:31.760 --> 15:34.000
I don't think that would make a difference
The inversion layer is too low.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.000
The emissions
from the mountain are trapped.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.360
- Bob.
- Fine!

15:38.160 --> 15:39.600
Then I'll just prove it.
But believe me.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.880
You've got to do something about it. Cut the
emissions or it won't be a theory much longer.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.600
Oh, Christ.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.640
Bob.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.160
Bob!

15:51.480 --> 15:53.080
You just made the
call too soon, Bob.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.320
No David, too late.
They're not seeing what can happen.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.200
- Could happen.
- No. I can show them exactly

15:57.280 --> 15:59.200
what can happen if everything
collides over Mexico City...

15:59.280 --> 16:00.800
- Then show them.
- Why don't they listen?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.560
Just Bob, do the science.
Show them.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.320
OK, David.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.000
I'll do the science.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
David.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.040
Oh, why do I have to watch this?

16:19.240 --> 16:22.360
Because Caroline thinks that it will give
you some perspective on the brothers.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.360
So that you know what
you're dealing with.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.000
<i>- Why don't you sit down?
- I'd rather stand.</i>

16:29.520 --> 16:32.520
That is Stefan Manford, age 30.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.080
He has a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology
from the University of Chicago.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.240
He does most of the talking.
The other one is his brother Vincent.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.560
34. Also has a Ph.D.
in Molecular Biology.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.280
- Also from the University of Chicago.
- Who's the suit?

16:45.360 --> 16:48.440
Lew Austiger. He oversees
the Midwest operations.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
<i>Can you explain to me
why you've been looking</i>

16:50.720 --> 16:52.760
<i>into various strains of viral DNA?</i>

16:53.160 --> 16:55.800
<i>- How else would we study a virus?
- Good answer.</i>

16:55.960 --> 16:58.360
<i>What exactly does that mean?
- Dumb question.</i>

16:58.720 --> 17:00.560
Well, Mr Austiger,
first we're going to need

17:00.720 --> 17:03.000
to explain to you a couple
of things about viral DNA.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.200
Yeah, no kidding.
Lew doesn't have a clue.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.880
<i>Well, viruses replicate themselves
by entering an intact cell</i>

17:08.960 --> 17:10.760
<i>and redirecting
the host's biosynthetic proc--</i>

17:10.839 --> 17:11.920
Hold it.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.359
Why am I watching this again?

17:14.520 --> 17:16.319
So that you will have some insight into--

17:16.400 --> 17:17.599
How incompetent your G-man is?

17:17.680 --> 17:19.400
He doesn't know
what they're fucking talking about.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.880
I think that's Caroline's point, David.
He needs your help.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.119
Well, somebody oughta
tell the President, you know,

17:24.160 --> 17:25.680
somebody ought to explain
to him, you know,

17:25.760 --> 17:28.000
that if you think you got a
couple of bad guy scientists,

17:28.079 --> 17:30.120
you don't send
a boy scout to talk to them.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.680
I'll be sure to write that down.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.280
You do that, Wes.
Where are we with the wine?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.920
Carlos says that he will have
a full report ready in a couple of hours.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.760
Well, let's reconvene in
a couple of hours, then. I got a headache.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.520
- Would you like an aspirin?
- You got one?

17:42.600 --> 17:43.520
No.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.480
I'm injecting the clean clouds

18:26.000 --> 18:28.400
with all the elements: gases, chemicals.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.720
Such the ones they're
converging on Mexico City.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.720
- Is that a piece of chicken?
- Flora, fauna.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.880
Animal, vegetable, mineral.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.680
I need to see how
they will react in this environment.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.160
What do think will happen?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.560
I think all the elements are there,
like all the gases.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.960
The sulfur dioxide
in the inversion layer,

18:45.120 --> 18:47.720
reinforced by the sulfur
dioxide in the brown cloud

18:47.920 --> 18:50.880
which will react with the rain
to create concentrated sulfuric acid,

18:51.160 --> 18:52.960
with pH levels as low as 1.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.280
It may take a while.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.480
Yeah.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.800
Well...

19:06.120 --> 19:09.120
In that case if you have time
would you like to get a coffee?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.280
I don't drink coffee.
It dries you out.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.960
Right. Well,
how about a tea.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.440
Same thing.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.800
Bob, I thought maybe we could talk.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.040
- Nothing to say.
- No, there is, Bob.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.440
I mean, we're both...

19:24.040 --> 19:26.280
Don't you want to talk about it?
Because I know I need to.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.320
Not just now.
I have to attend to...

19:28.560 --> 19:30.440
Have you spoken with
the Mexicans?

19:31.160 --> 19:32.800
- I have a call in.
- Caroline,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.320
they need an evacuation plan.
They need to start moving people out, now.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.200
They're not going to evacuate a entire city
based on a theory from a Canadian Biochemist.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.560
Then they're goddamn idiots!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.600
Caroline, we are living
in a decade of disasters.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.120
Hurricane Katrina, we saw it coming.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.920
The tsunami in Asia,
we could have been prepared.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.280
We could have helped millions in Africa
who have died of AIDS, who are still dying.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.400
Fed the starving in China. When are we going
to learn that we can prevent people from dying?

19:55.440 --> 19:57.760
- I don't know, Bob.
- Sulfuric acid, Caroline.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.880
I know it's going to happen.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.520
At that pH level, it'll would melt things.
Flesh will burn on contact.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.520
The rain will get into the cracks
in the foundations of the buildings,

20:05.600 --> 20:08.160
they will topple over.
Power lines will corrode.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.440
The entire sewage and water
system will be contaminated.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.240
The city will... It'll be gone.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.520
Okay, Bob.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.520
It's all right.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.120
All right.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.240
Sorry, I swore just now.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.240
No, I understand.

20:31.640 --> 20:32.800
Caroline.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.320
I keep seeing him.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.560
Yeah. Me too.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.000
He's running, you know?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.520
I see him running and...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.680
He's going towards me.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.960
He looks so happy.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.400
He is, Bob.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.400
He was so young.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.600
You know,
he has so much ahead of him.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.960
Makes you think if I were to die
tomorrow, who would miss me?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.920
I would.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.240
Sulfuric acid, Caroline.
I know what's going to happen.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.760
At that pH level, it melts things.
Flesh will burn on contact.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.280
The rain will get into the cracks
in the foundations of the buildings.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.800
They will topple over.
Power lines will corrode.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.600
The entire sewage and water
system will be contaminated...

21:51.480 --> 21:52.680
Yeah Mom.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.800
Carlos, hello my darling.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.840
WHat are you still doing there ?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.640
Oh, it's so hot today...

22:00.240 --> 22:02.920
How is the air in the city?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.840
Awful, just awful...

22:05.600 --> 22:09.000
Look... I want you to stay inside
and put on the air conditioner.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.160
That's what I'm doing.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.120
I can hear you wheezing a lot.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.480
No, no, I'm fine.

22:16.480 --> 22:20.440
Look, I want you to go to the beach house
for a couple a days. A few days. Call Manuel.

22:20.720 --> 22:25.720
Oh, Carlos, it's too much trouble.
You really think it's necessary ?

22:25.880 --> 22:27.320
Yes, immediately.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.680
Alright, I'll do what you say...

22:32.080 --> 22:33.120
I love you too...

22:34.160 --> 22:36.760
I love you a lot, too...

22:47.360 --> 22:49.960
Hey Owen. Listen,
I've got to go to Chicago.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.760
I might be back late.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.560
No worries.
I'll take care of the place.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.960
Take care, as in, don't trash it.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.440
Gotcha.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.600
Look, I'll take care of the place. I'll...

23:00.920 --> 23:02.800
even clean
the toilets for you.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.480
- No shit?
- None whatsoever.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.760
All right, well, listen.
No guests. No fucking around.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.400
You break it,
you fix it. You got it?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.600
Cool. Have fun in Chicago.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.920
A full report on the wine.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.200
I appreciate that, Governor,
but it the scenario unfolds like we predict...

23:51.400 --> 23:53.520
it may be too late to do anything.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.080
You have three things converging:
the Asian Brown Cloud,

23:56.240 --> 24:00.080
the inversion layer and the gases and ash
that are coming out of Mt. Popocatapetl.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.320
I've never been like this... I seriously
urge you to be prepared to the worst...

24:05.440 --> 24:08.880
Don't cross tour fingers and hope all this
passes by. Develop an evacuation plan.

24:10.480 --> 24:16.040
Yes, I appreciate it. Of course,
I'll keep you updated. Goodbye.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.280
Yeah.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.520
Not locking it anymore, eh?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.000
What have you got there?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.360
Report on the wine.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.800
Jill and Carlos
finished the PCR.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.160
You want the long version
or the short version?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.000
Caroline?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.200
Oh sorry, go ahead.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.440
Look,

24:52.840 --> 24:54.800
about before...

24:57.560 --> 25:00.880
I was a complete jerk,
and you don't deserve that.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.720
Especially not after
everything you've done for me.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.040
And I promise, from now on...

25:07.400 --> 25:09.760
I'm going to make sure
things are different between us.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.400
But why didn't you just
tell me about your nephew?

25:15.320 --> 25:18.160
I know we go at it
from time to time, but I mean...

25:19.040 --> 25:21.080
Did you think I didn't
care about how you felt?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.160
Because I do.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.000
Glenn is dead, but you're
still very much alive, Caroline.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.080
Maybe you just need
to be reminded of that fact.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.960
I am so sorry.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.160
I make things so difficult
for you all the time.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.600
Apology accepted.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.440
Apology?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.440
Have you heard a word I've said?
I'm talking about the fucking wine!

26:05.640 --> 26:08.440
- Oh, sorry.
- Apology accepted.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.120
- What?
- There's nothing in it.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.200
There's nothing in the wine,
nothing in the bottle,

26:12.400 --> 26:14.520
nothing in the cork, nothing in
the label, nothing in the glue.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.120
There's not even
the regular amount of toxins

26:16.280 --> 26:17.920
from pesticides
that most wine has.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.520
How's that?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.440
Because they used organic
grapes. I don't know.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.640
It's plonk, but it's clean. So?

26:25.400 --> 26:26.480
So...

26:26.800 --> 26:28.320
Let's go to Chicago.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.360
Homeland Security
is convinced they're dirty.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.480
Homeland Security is convinced

26:43.680 --> 26:45.040
- the Pope is dirty.
- David...

26:45.160 --> 26:46.720
What? Where's the evidence?

26:49.040 --> 26:51.520
They've been watching them
for the last 2 years.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.400
Seems they've been trying
to get the President's attention.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.760
Picketed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
visited the ranch...

26:57.920 --> 26:59.040
Jus.. just, I got it.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.280
They showed up at every major
speech the President's made.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.520
That's a crime?

27:03.640 --> 27:05.600
Two weeks ago the Secret
Service approached them.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.400
They were carrying 2 vials
with Hepatitis C virus.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.880
You know, that happens.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.720
I've been known to carry a virus
from one town to the next.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.080
Couriers
are getting expensive.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.080
Look Caroline
we went over everything, right?

27:17.240 --> 27:20.240
The wine and the cork and the glue
on the label. We backed them up on that.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.160
Yeah, and Austiger searched their lab,

27:22.200 --> 27:24.000
their hard drives,
their car, their apartment...

27:24.240 --> 27:25.800
Let me guess,
they found nothing. Right?

27:25.880 --> 27:27.120
They didn't find anything. No.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.840
- Then why are we on this fucking witch hunt?
- Because we've been directed to.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.120
David Sandstrom,
chief scientist at NorBAC.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.760
Lew Austiger,
Homeland Security.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.640
Yeah, I know,
I saw the TV show.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.840
I can ask better questions, Lew,
but I can't guarantee better answers.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.320
What do you make of it?

27:53.640 --> 27:55.440
They look like yeast samples.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.040
You guys check all these out?

27:57.120 --> 27:58.240
We did.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.600
David?

28:31.440 --> 28:32.760
What is it?

28:41.880 --> 28:43.800
It looks like they're
working on a vaccine.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.560
- The graph, right?
- Yeah, looked like kill curves.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.440
What about the schematic?

28:50.560 --> 28:51.960
Oh, I don't know.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.080
- Retrotransposition?
- Sure. Why not?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.600
Well, keep looking. See if
you can pick up anything else.

28:58.800 --> 28:59.760
Right. Later.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.120
What's retrotransposition?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.480
Uh... It has to do with how...

29:11.320 --> 29:13.800
a retrovirus like HIV

29:13.960 --> 29:16.880
or HepB makes
a home in its host genome.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.520
David, got to think these guys
are up to something more

29:20.600 --> 29:22.360
than just sending wine
to the President?

29:24.400 --> 29:26.160
I think I'd like to meet them.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.040
This is what's going
to happen to Mexico City?

29:56.280 --> 29:58.680
If things continue as they are, it's not impossible.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.000
Are they continuing?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
- Bob, can I?
- Yes, of course.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.240
Ah... I'm just looking at the latest data from NOAA.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.160
Ok, so the cloud is 97 miles
outside of Mexico City.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.400
It hasn't deviated its course.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.400
C02 and S02 have not dissipated

30:18.520 --> 30:20.240
in the cloud
or the inversion layer.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.040
What are they saying
about the prevailing winds?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.400
Right now it's calm,

30:25.480 --> 30:28.280
but according to the weather service,
if there's a gust, anything.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.440
Mexico City is in big trouble.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.800
Why are they not evacuating?

30:32.920 --> 30:34.800
I don't think they're putting
all the factors together.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.720
The cloud. The winds.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.000
The inversion layer.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.520
The gases coming out
of the mountain...

30:39.640 --> 30:42.200
Even if they shut down every car,
closed down every factory,

30:42.320 --> 30:43.560
what's done is done.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.400
It's just a matter of time.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.520
Ok, but we know about it.
We're ahead of the game.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.400
- Can we stop it?
- We have to.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.560
Ok Bob, in your tank,
you theoretically have duplicated

30:52.640 --> 30:54.440
the weather conditions
over Mexico, right?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.520
Like you have the exact combination of
gases that they can expect in 24 hours.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.760
If we could neutralize the Asian Brown Cloud,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.480
if we could make it
so it has no effect...

31:01.720 --> 31:03.040
Can we do that?

31:03.640 --> 31:05.320
I don't know.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.480
I have to get to work.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.080
I could try to neutralize it with...

31:10.640 --> 31:14.000
bicarbonate of soda,
but I have to test it.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.280
We'll help you and we'll figure this out.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.360
Thanks Carlos. Could you grab?

31:18.520 --> 31:19.480
Yeah.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.440
Let's get to work. Thanks to Mayko.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.000
- How did you get in here?
- Not important.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.040
- Picked the lock.
- Thank you.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.080
- You're welcome.
- Is that legal?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.440
We have a warrant.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.760
I wouldn't do that.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.840
This is our lab.
You're violating our space.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.720
We just want to ask
you a few questions, Stefan.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.080
What is it that you do
at NorBAC, Caroline?

31:46.320 --> 31:48.120
I'm Chief Administrator.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.880
- You're not a scientist?
- I'm not a scientist.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.120
Well why would
you have questions for us?

31:55.560 --> 31:56.640
David...

31:56.960 --> 31:59.920
In 1995, you were at
the Newcastle Institute in England,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.480
you gave a lecture on proteomics
of nuclear receptors
in drosophilia.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.160
Oh, yeah, the thing on flies.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.960
- It was very inspiring.
- Thank you.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.880
Why did you send
a bottle of wine to the President?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.760
How do you feel
about the war in Iraq, David?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.480
- What?
- Do you think the best way

32:12.600 --> 32:14.960
to keep the world safe
and free from terrorism

32:15.080 --> 32:16.720
is to have soldiers in the Middle East?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.440
Killing innocent women
and children.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.760
- Was there anything in the wine?
- Did you find anything in it?

32:22.360 --> 32:24.600
Why have you been buying viral DNA?

32:26.160 --> 32:27.960
We use it in our experiments.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.800
You didn't really think he was going
to drink it, though, did you?

32:31.040 --> 32:31.920
The wine?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.640
Of course not.
He quit drinking at the age of 40 in 1986.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.560
- Then why'd you send him wine?
- We wanted to remind him

32:37.680 --> 32:39.760
of the blood of American
soldiers who died in Iraq.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.960
We wrote that in our note.
Did he get our note?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.960
So this whole thing has just
been about protesting the war, eh?

32:48.400 --> 32:50.640
We think it's very important.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.800
Let's test the carbonate.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.320
Everything is mixing up in the cloud:

32:57.480 --> 33:00.120
Sulfur dioxide, carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.120
The molecules are reacting
with water to create sulfuric acid.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.280
- Acid rain?
- Yes.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.800
It's all forming.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.880
Here goes the lime.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.480
Ok, so what? Is it working?

33:19.680 --> 33:21.840
The sulfuric acid is neutralizing.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.200
What is that?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.720
If the cloud receive it too quickly,

33:27.840 --> 33:31.400
the acid reacts with the bicarbonate
of soda turning it into a solid.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.880
In reality, those concrete pellets
would be the size of golf balls.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.920
It's just a question
of the proportion, no?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.760
I don't think so.
The acid concentration is too strong.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.680
I need another chemical.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.480
Less than 22 hours.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.960
*

33:56.760 --> 33:59.720
*

34:00.800 --> 34:03.440
*

34:03.880 --> 34:06.600
*

34:06.840 --> 34:08.360
*

34:08.760 --> 34:10.920
*

34:11.360 --> 34:14.560
*

34:15.239 --> 34:18.360
*

34:18.480 --> 34:20.679
*

34:23.000 --> 34:26.360
*

34:28.800 --> 34:31.880
*

34:32.040 --> 34:33.960
*

34:34.199 --> 34:35.600
*

34:36.360 --> 34:37.280
*

34:39.960 --> 34:41.560
Stubborn woman.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.840
You've ordered retroviral DNA
from time to time, why?

34:47.040 --> 34:50.480
- We're scientists.
- Yeah, I know. For what purpose?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.679
- We use it in our work.
- What work?

34:53.840 --> 34:56.040
You want me to tell you
what we're working on?

34:56.120 --> 34:58.800
- Yeah.
- David. She's not a scientist.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
No, she's not.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.800
Neither is he.
They'll never understand.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.960
Hey, easy. Are you trying to find
drugs to inhibit retrotransposition?

35:05.640 --> 35:06.560
No.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.440
Then what are you trying to do?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.280
David, can I talk to you for a second?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.480
We have any idea
what they're up to.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.560
I mean, they're
definitively up to something,

35:25.600 --> 35:27.680
but these guys could be
cooking up anything

35:27.920 --> 35:30.240
from a viral pandemic
to a cure for cancer.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.840
David, we need to find out.

35:31.920 --> 35:35.160
- They're not going to talk to us, Caroline.
- No, but they're going to talk to you.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.320
Not with Dick Tracy in the room. They don't
trust him. He's "outside our domain."

35:38.440 --> 35:41.040
Yeah, well, I think
they feel the same about me, so...

35:41.200 --> 35:42.560
They're all yours.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.480
Wha...? Wait a minute.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.720
- Are you married?
- No.

35:47.960 --> 35:48.960
Makes sense.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.600
What's that suppose to mean?

35:51.040 --> 35:52.240
Your shoes are polished.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.200
Your shirt came from a laundry,
but you have a spot on your tie.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.360
You have people to look
after your hygiene

35:57.560 --> 35:58.920
but nobody to look at you.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.840
Your wife would have seen the spot.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.400
Agent Austiger,
how about I buy you a beer?

36:06.080 --> 36:08.240
- Ooh. A beer sounds good.
- We make our own.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.600
Now.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.600
Yeah. Why don't you guys
come back in like an hour.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.120
So guys...

36:25.200 --> 36:26.200
What are you doing?

36:26.400 --> 36:28.560
Oh, shit. Hang on.
Hold that thought.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.920
I've got to...

36:30.600 --> 36:33.000
I've been waiting for...
Yeah, it's my lab, I've got to take this.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.080
What?

36:34.160 --> 36:36.360
<i>- Mexico City is in trouble, David.
- What?</i>

36:36.720 --> 36:38.920
General Carvajale called
extremely apologetic.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.440
A lot of good that does us now.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.120
It seems in the mountains,
outside the city,

36:42.200 --> 36:44.240
slightly acidic rain
is beginning to fall.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.800
If I'm right,
concentrated sulfuric acid

36:47.040 --> 36:48.920
- will hit before daylight.
- You are right, Bob.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.040
You've been right every
step of the way.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.600
David, I've tried to neutralize
the cloud with bicarbonate of soda.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.400
- The acid is too concentrated?
- Yes.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.920
And I don't have enough time
to test every other base.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.800
Okay, we got one shot at this.
Hang on a second.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.160
What's the best way to
neutralize sulfuric acid ?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.320
A strong alkaline solution.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.920
- But if the acid's too strong, the combination could explode.
- Up in the atmosphere.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.280
- Ammonia.
- Oh geez! Yeah.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.560
Bob, ammonia.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.600
I mean, I know it's volatile. I know
it's toxic but it's a hell of an alkali.

37:16.720 --> 37:17.760
- May I?
- That's true.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.360
Bob, I'm going to put
you on speaker.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.600
What's the sulfuric acid content
in the atmosphere right now?

37:23.880 --> 37:26.240
According to the NOAA, 14 million tons.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.200
- 14 million tons.
- That's a lot.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.880
Okay. How much ammonia
do we have to add?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.600
- To neutralize it?
- Yeah.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.560
What's the molecular
weight of sulfuric acid ?

37:34.840 --> 37:37.600
- H2SO4. Sulphur is 35.
- 4 Oxygens is 64.

37:37.680 --> 37:38.840
And 2 Hydrogens... 101.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.880
Okay. Molecular weight of ammonia?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.240
17.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.640
- 2.356 Million tons.
- That's a lot of ammonia.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.880
Worst case scenario, Bob,
if we can't get it in the clouds?

37:55.040 --> 37:58.040
Well, if we don't get enough in there
the acid rain comes down...

37:58.520 --> 38:01.280
- in a monsoon.
- Jesus.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.760
Anybody got any better ideas?

38:05.440 --> 38:08.440
- A catalyst to reduce the acid?
- A platinum catalyst transformation...

38:08.680 --> 38:10.960
- But that would take ten years.
- And a lot of money...

38:11.160 --> 38:12.880
Go with the ammonia, Bob.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.920
- Good work.
- Okay. Bye.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.080
- What was that?
- There's this cloud hanging

38:19.240 --> 38:22.120
over Mexico City chock full of SO2,
and one of my guys thinks

38:22.320 --> 38:25.880
it's about to dump concentrated
sulfuric acid down on everything.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.720
He's been tracking it for a week.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.280
I got taken off the case
because Homeland Security thinks

38:30.320 --> 38:32.720
that two brilliant scientists
are trying to kill the President

38:32.800 --> 38:34.760
- of the United States.
- That's not true.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.040
We're sorry for taking
you away from your clouds.

38:37.200 --> 38:40.240
Don't worry about it. We're taking
a chance, but we think we got it.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.520
It's sad. How we destroy our planet.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.960
Anyway, going back to what you
were saying about retrotransposition.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.840
All these yeast samples in your lab.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.080
Are you proposing to use yeast
as a model for retrovirus life cycle?

38:55.120 --> 38:57.840
Come on guys. Am I going to have
to test everything in your lab?

38:57.960 --> 39:00.720
because that's what they want me to do and
that's what these morons are going to make me do,

39:00.920 --> 39:03.520
test every goddamn thing
right down to your pipettes.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.920
- You don't have to do that.
- Then tell me what you're trying to do?

39:08.000 --> 39:11.720
Are you trying to make a drug
to inhibit retrotransposition?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.280
I'm on your side, guys.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.160
Well. We're hoping the yeast

39:23.320 --> 39:26.280
will give us different
ways to combat HIV.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.640
So you're...

39:30.320 --> 39:33.080
You're testing for HIV
inhibitors in a yeast model?

39:33.360 --> 39:35.240
Not testing. Not exactly.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.200
- The yeast is more of a vector.
- A delivery system.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.040
You see, the world
doesn't need more HIV drugs.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.520
What the world needs
is a way to prevent people

39:44.600 --> 39:47.000
- from getting sick in the first place.
- A vaccine.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.040
Yes. But, look at Hepatitis vaccines.
They exist.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.960
They're available, but do the poor
and disenfranchised get them?

39:55.680 --> 39:58.280
- We're thinking of something a little different.
- Vincent.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.360
It's alright.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.040
- Please.
- No, no. Vincent. Vincent, keep going.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.000
So, you're making a vaccine in yeast.
How is that going to help?

40:06.120 --> 40:09.400
There's a lot of vaccines made in yeast and
that doesn't make them more available to the poor.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.440
I'm not talking about a vaccine in yeast.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.720
- I'm talking about yeast.
- Vincent, please!

40:19.480 --> 40:21.920
I'm just pondering, perhaps

40:22.160 --> 40:25.880
the method of delivery
for hepatitis vaccines is inefficient.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.240
What? Like what,
there's not enough needles?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.000
Oh! No fucking way.

40:38.440 --> 40:41.520
You guys are trying to find
a way to put a vaccine in bread?

40:42.360 --> 40:44.360
That is fucking brilliant!

40:45.400 --> 40:48.520
Wai-wai-wait.
What about thermostability?

40:48.640 --> 40:50.400
How is the vaccine going
to survive the baking?

40:52.080 --> 40:55.720
Come on, guys, tell me, I'm not
gonna fucking scoop you! Tell me!

40:57.960 --> 41:00.000
I figured that part out long ago.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.160
With everything I saw in their lab,
their idea makes perfect sense.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.560
Actually, it makes perfect brilliant sense.
I can see why they weren't keen to share.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.320
I know plenty of scientists
who would scoop them in a second.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.920
Are you satisfied with this?

41:12.160 --> 41:14.760
It's not a question
of my own satisfaction.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.400
They missed it, Vincent.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.600
We knew they would, Stefan.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.840
Yeah, we just landed.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.640
No, she took a cab home.
What's going on?

41:43.880 --> 41:46.920
Well, it doesn't sound like there's
anything I can do about it tonight so...

41:47.600 --> 41:50.720
Yeah, well I'll be home
if anything changes, okay Bob?

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
Oh. And Bob...

41:52.800 --> 41:55.000
if you can,
try to get some sleep.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.200
I said if you can, Bob.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.120
Bob, have you got the results?

42:59.360 --> 43:01.680
- It's not going to work, Carlos?
- Why?

43:01.800 --> 43:04.480
The ammonia, we can't get enough of it.
It'll rain acid.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.200
It's not going to work.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
We only have a few hours left.

43:20.840 --> 43:22.840
Forget it, we're not going
to get enough ammonia.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.000
No, even if we tapped into US supplies
and got them here in time.

43:26.200 --> 43:29.160
350,000 metric tonnes would only
bring the pH of the cloud up to 2.5.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.840
So, we need something else.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.720
This chick called last night,
said, Harlan died.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.480
I think Harlan left us something.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.720
He said what he was working on
could be a potential moneymaker.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.600
He said even millions.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.160
Actually I think these genes
have to do with sexual reproduction.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.200
Multiple orgasms, I'd pay for that.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.240
A fifty percent increase in suicides?

43:52.440 --> 43:55.520
And you don't think it's related
to the hurricane damage Katrina caused?

43:55.720 --> 43:57.000
Suicides don't spread.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.880
- Usually, there are different
suicide rates for males and females.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.200
- Different races.
- True, but in the counties

44:02.320 --> 44:05.160
in the 50% zone, the results are
the same across all demographics.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.200
Even kids.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.960
Two hundred bucks
missing from my wallet.

44:08.120 --> 44:09.320
- Owen?
- No, elves.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.160
I saw him about an hour ago
and he was flying.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.000
- On what?
- Meth.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.800
What did you do?
Rob a Starbucks?

44:18.480 --> 44:21.040
- I'm... I'm sick, man. I--
- What do you want, Owen?

44:21.640 --> 44:25.440
It's cold on the street, and I know...
I need to get better.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.480
I don't want you
to get hurt by Owen, okay?

44:27.560 --> 44:29.240
You can't trust him.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.960
There is so much going on
through our website.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.640
I've made some videos to get you up to speed.
Every week, I'll post another one.
