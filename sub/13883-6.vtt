(POP MUSIC)

00:11.640 --> 00:14.837
# When I saw you for the first time
# First time

00:14.837 --> 00:17.798
# My knees began to quiver
# Quiver

00:17.798 --> 00:21.350
# And I got a funny feeling
# Feeling

00:21.350 --> 00:25.353
# In my kidneys and my liver
# Digestive system, baby

00:25.353 --> 00:28.830
# My hands they started shakin'
# Shakin'

00:28.830 --> 00:32.151
# My heart began a-thumpin'
# Boom, boom, boom!

00:32.151 --> 00:35.471
# My breakfast left my body
# Huey, huey, huey

00:35.471 --> 00:38.074
# It all really tells me something

00:38.074 --> 00:40.515
# Girl, you make me tongue-tied
# Tongue-tied

00:40.515 --> 00:42.238
# Tongue-tied

00:42.238 --> 00:45.596
# Whenever you are near me
# Near me

00:45.596 --> 00:47.238
# Tied tongue
# Tied tongue

00:47.238 --> 00:48.992
# Tied tongue
# Tied tongue

00:48.992 --> 00:51.310
# Whenever you're in town

00:55.080 --> 00:58.197
# I saw you across the dance floor
# Dancing

00:58.197 --> 01:02.114
# I thought of birds and bees
# Reproductive system, baby

01:02.114 --> 01:05.272
# But when I tried to speak to you
# Talk, talk

01:05.272 --> 01:08.989
# My tongue unravelled to my knees
# Flippety-flippety-flop

01:08.989 --> 01:12.470
# I tried to say "I love you"
# Love you

01:12.470 --> 01:16.189
# But it came out kind of wrong, girl
# Wrong, girl

01:16.189 --> 01:18.271
# It sounded like, "Noo-noony-nee-noo"

01:18.271 --> 01:21.591
# Tongue-tied
Na-ner-ner-ner-nee-nung, nirl

01:21.591 --> 01:24.353
# Because you make me tongue-tied
# Tongue-tied

01:24.353 --> 01:26.032
# Tongue-tied

01:26.032 --> 01:29.430
# Whenever you are near me
# Near me

01:29.430 --> 01:33.149
# Be-dobby-durgle, dobby-durgle
# Tongue-tied, tongue-tied

01:33.149 --> 01:35.629
# Whenever you're around

01:41.160 --> 01:45.199
# Oh, I'm beggin' on my knees

01:45.199 --> 01:49.193
# Sweet, sweet darling, listen, please

01:49.193 --> 01:53.671
# Understand me when I say

01:54.280 --> 01:58.398
# Bedurble diggle doggle-
dooby-doggle-durgle-day

01:59.720 --> 02:02.188
# I'm trying to say nungy-nangy
# Nangy-nongy

02:02.188 --> 02:04.077
# Ningy-nongy

02:04.077 --> 02:07.232
# Why can't I tell you clearly?
# Clearly

02:07.232 --> 02:09.151
# Be-dobby-durgle
# Dobby-durgle

02:09.151 --> 02:10.958
# Durgle-dobby
# Durgle-dobby

02:10.958 --> 02:12.712
# Whenever you're around... #

02:15.280 --> 02:17.840
- This isn't the one.
- What isn't?

02:17.840 --> 02:22.550
I'm looking for this dream I had
on the dream recorder. It was sensational.

02:22.550 --> 02:25.837
- What was it about?
- Me, three girls

02:25.837 --> 02:28.480
and a tub of banana yoghurt!

02:28.480 --> 02:31.791
You cats have a strange attitude to women.

02:31.791 --> 02:34.235
Say what, goalpost-head?

02:34.920 --> 02:38.799
It's all sex. No sense of settling down,
long-term relationships.

02:38.799 --> 02:43.510
Hey, as soon as I find
the right small group of girls,

02:43.510 --> 02:48.196
the seven or eight women who are right for me,
my wandering days are over.

02:48.196 --> 02:50.271
You see? Totally maladjusted.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.193
That's rich from the man whose favourite book

02:53.193 --> 02:56.477
is "How To Pick Up Girls By Hypnosis".

02:56.477 --> 03:01.429
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's a good book and it works.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.511
Get outta town!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.709
That's how I met Lorraine.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.439
You hypnotised her into a date?

03:11.439 --> 03:16.640
Yes. I gave her the old
"There's something in your eye" technique,

03:16.640 --> 03:22.431
fixed her with the Mesmer stare...
and bingo, she agreed to go on a date.

03:22.431 --> 03:25.398
- What was wrong with her?
- Nothing.

03:25.398 --> 03:28.756
Come on. She went out with you.

03:28.756 --> 03:31.638
She was an attractive, bright young lady.

03:31.638 --> 03:33.711
It MUST work, then.

03:33.711 --> 03:37.759
- Of course, she had an artificial nose.
- What?!

03:37.759 --> 03:42.152
Oh, tastefully done. Quality metal, no rivets.

03:42.152 --> 03:47.360
- Come on, what happened?
- Things were a bit stilted in the taxi.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.796
My jokes about her nose hadn't gone down well.

03:50.796 --> 03:56.193
They were quality gags, like,
"Where are we going? Who nose?"

03:56.193 --> 03:58.271
No cheap shots.

03:58.271 --> 04:02.114
Anyway, at the restaurant,
she had an attack of nerves.

04:02.114 --> 04:05.954
She went to the loo and climbed out the window.

04:05.954 --> 04:10.397
- I wonder why.
- Not because she didn't like me.

04:10.397 --> 04:13.552
She phoned and said she'd love another date,

04:13.552 --> 04:16.358
only she had to move to Pluto.

04:16.358 --> 04:19.512
You're a sad weasel of a man, Rimmer.

04:19.512 --> 04:22.910
No, I'm just uncomfortable with the opposite sex.

04:22.910 --> 04:27.073
You see them as aliens
to be conquered with trickery.

04:27.073 --> 04:32.314
They're people. You don't need books
on hypnosis and...what's the other one?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.960
"1001 Fabulous Chat-up Lines."

04:34.960 --> 04:38.874
Lister, those chat-up lines are guaranteed.

04:38.874 --> 04:43.590
- There's no such thing.
- All right. You be a woman, OK?

04:44.680 --> 04:49.879
On your own in a bar,
short leather miniskirt, peephole bra...

04:49.879 --> 04:51.951
OK. Go on.

04:51.951 --> 04:56.318
This is the most incredible chat-up line
you've ever heard.

04:56.318 --> 04:58.914
- Go on.
- OK...

05:01.200 --> 05:05.079
Excuse me, would you like
to join me for a cocktail?

05:05.079 --> 05:07.993
- No.
- You can't say no.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.035
- You've got to say yes.
- Oh, right. OK. Go on.

05:13.720 --> 05:18.555
- So, would you like a wormdo?
- What's that, then?

05:20.640 --> 05:23.154
- What's what?
- A wormdo.

05:23.154 --> 05:27.199
- What about it?
- Is this still the opening line?

05:27.199 --> 05:30.829
- You're not giving the right replies!
- What's that?

05:30.829 --> 05:34.833
I say, "Would you like a cocktail?"
You say "Yes".

05:34.833 --> 05:39.232
I say, "Would you like a wormdo?"
You say, "What's a wormdo?" I say...

05:39.232 --> 05:42.630
- "It wriggles along like that."
- You know it!

05:42.630 --> 05:47.475
You couldn't pull a rotten tooth
from a dead horse's head with that.

05:47.475 --> 05:50.597
- Eureka, I've done it,
- Done what?

05:50.597 --> 05:53.069
The Earl of Sandwich invented sandwiches,

05:53.069 --> 05:55.151
Samuel Morse invented Morse Code,

05:55.151 --> 05:58.073
Plato invented the plate,,,

05:58.073 --> 06:02.199
and now I, Holly,
have invented the Holly Hop Drive,

06:02.199 --> 06:07.638
- Ooh, I can't wait to see it (! )
- It's monumental, this, Epoch-making,

06:07.638 --> 06:11.633
It can transfer any object instantly
to any other point in space,

06:11.633 --> 06:15.508
- What? We can go back to Earth?
- In seconds,

06:15.508 --> 06:20.151
You mean we can go back to Earth
right now? This instant?

06:20.151 --> 06:23.118
- Right on,
- Rock and roll!

06:25.000 --> 06:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.920 --> 06:39.230
- Is this it?
- What do you think?

06:39.230 --> 06:42.949
It's just a box with "Stop" and "Start" on it!

06:44.680 --> 06:46.671
It's fairly straightforward,

06:47.400 --> 06:49.675
Ifyou want to start it, press "Start",,,

06:49.675 --> 06:53.230
You can work out the rest yourself,

06:53.230 --> 06:56.312
It's absolutely pathetic.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.036
Right, Let's Holly Hop, Engage drive,,,

07:00.036 --> 07:02.839
Drive engaged, Initiating ignition sequence,,,

07:02.839 --> 07:06.230
- Ignition sequence initiated,
- Get on with it.

07:06.230 --> 07:11.030
It takes time, this, One error
in any of my 13 billion calculations,

07:11.030 --> 07:13.156
we'll be blasted to smithereens,

07:13.156 --> 07:16.915
Here we go, then, Ten,,, Nine,,, Eight,,,

07:16.915 --> 07:19.639
- Six,,, Five,,,
- You forgot seven.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.115
Did I? I've always had a blind spot with sevens,

07:25.240 --> 07:27.708
We're going to die.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.518
No problem, I'll start lower down,

07:33.520 --> 07:35.511
One,,, Blast off,

07:38.600 --> 07:40.955
We've done it, We're home,

07:40.955 --> 07:44.874
- It worked?
- We're at Earth? You must be joking!

07:44.874 --> 07:47.235
Half a mo',

07:48.000 --> 07:50.434
- It's gone,
- What has?

07:50.434 --> 07:54.229
The Earth, It's missing, It's not there,

07:54.840 --> 07:58.719
Wait a minute,
I was looking out the wrong window,

08:00.120 --> 08:04.238
No, it HAS gone,
The entire solar system is missing,

08:04.238 --> 08:09.269
- Well, what is actually out there?
- Nothing, Just space,

08:09.269 --> 08:15.799
Holly, the thought occurs
that we haven't actually reached Earth.

08:15.799 --> 08:20.590
The further thought occurs
that we haven't budged a smegging inch.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.076
No, no, we have,

08:24.076 --> 08:28.278
It's just I don't know where we are,
I've flamingoed up,

08:28.278 --> 08:32.956
- What?
- It's like a cock-up, only much bigger,

08:32.956 --> 08:35.873
Wait, there is something, It's another ship,

08:35.873 --> 08:39.077
- Aliens!
- (LISTER) Punch it up.

08:39.077 --> 08:43.198
- It's an exact copy of Red Dwarf,
- Eh? What's happened?

08:43.198 --> 08:45.271
Somehow - don 't ask me how -

08:45.271 --> 08:50.354
- we've entered the fifth dimension,
- What's the fifth dimension?

08:50.354 --> 08:54.479
Didn't they reach Number Six
with "I Want Your Love Thing"?

08:54.479 --> 08:58.758
You've got your basic dimensions -
length, breadth, depth and time,

08:58.758 --> 09:01.195
The fifth dimension is co-existing realities,

09:01.195 --> 09:04.750
two bodies sharing the same space,
unaware of each other,

09:04.750 --> 09:07.912
Sounds li ke my parents i n bed.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.678
So, this is another Red Dwarf,
with another Rimmer and Lister?

09:12.678 --> 09:17.754
- Will they be exactly the same?
- No, there will be differences,

09:17.754 --> 09:22.436
- What do you mean?
- In this universe, Hitler could've won the war,

09:22.436 --> 09:26.911
or even more incredible,
perhaps Ringo was a really good drummer,

09:26.911 --> 09:31.312
Hang on, I'm linking up
with their computer,

09:31.312 --> 09:34.949
- Hello, I'm Hilly,
- Hello, I'm Holly,

09:34.949 --> 09:37.952
- Hello, Holly,
- Hello, Hilly,

09:37.952 --> 09:43.068
This is a turn -up, You 'd better
boogie on over and sort it out,

09:43.068 --> 09:45.151
Right on, sis,

09:45.151 --> 09:47.708
- See you, Hol,
- See you, Hil,

09:48.880 --> 09:50.871
I'm in there,

10:07.320 --> 10:11.472
It's identical i n every detai I to our Red Dwarf!

10:11.472 --> 10:15.838
Very funny smell around here
that I don't like one bit.

10:15.838 --> 10:19.959
It smells like your moon boots.
I'm going to get rid of it.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.831
That's mine. This is mine...

10:23.400 --> 10:26.358
So, where's the other Rimmer and Lister?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.235
So, you're not aliens.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.075
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

10:42.075 --> 10:45.869
- You must be Lister?
- You are, too.

10:45.869 --> 10:49.714
- You must be Rimmer. So am I.
- Splendid.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.870
- Deb.
- Dave.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.518
- Arnold.
- Arlene.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.556
Indeedy!

11:11.640 --> 11:15.679
So, your universe
is exactly the same as ours... Can I?

11:15.679 --> 11:17.352
Yeah.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.111
Only everything's...opposite?

11:23.111 --> 11:27.159
I don't know if everything's opposite.
It seems like that.

11:27.159 --> 11:30.391
You come from a female-orientated society?

11:30.391 --> 11:33.711
Well, it's not exactly female-orientated
any more,

11:33.711 --> 11:38.874
not since the '60s,
the "Equal Rights For Men" marches,

11:38.874 --> 11:41.155
when they burned their jockstraps.

11:41.155 --> 11:43.037
Stop!

11:43.037 --> 11:46.157
Haven't you read "The Male Eunuch"
by Jeremy Greer?

11:46.157 --> 11:50.472
So, your history is parallel to ours, as well?

11:50.472 --> 11:53.632
So, who was the first person on the moon?

11:53.632 --> 11:55.676
Nellie Armstrong.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.797
NELLIE Armstrong?

11:58.797 --> 12:02.589
- So...who wrote Hamlet?
- Will Shakespeare.

12:02.589 --> 12:07.037
- Ah, so he was a bloke.
- No, Wilma Shakespeare.

12:07.037 --> 12:11.671
She wrote all the greats - "Rachel III",
"The Taming Of The Shrimp"...

12:11.671 --> 12:14.320
My God, what's this?

12:14.320 --> 12:17.676
- My Camera Monthly magazine.
- It's disgusting!

12:17.676 --> 12:22.072
It's full of semi-naked blokes
draped over sports cars.

12:22.072 --> 12:25.709
You're not one
of those boring masculinists, are you?

12:27.440 --> 12:30.398
So, sexual attitudes are opposite, as well?

12:30.398 --> 12:33.074
What's that, my little cupcake?

12:33.074 --> 12:35.196
Your little what?!

12:35.196 --> 12:40.673
It just looks ridiculous!
These models are hugely deformed.

12:40.673 --> 12:43.877
It makes one feel quite...inadequate.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.233
- Don't worry about that, my pretty.
- They can touch each other!

12:50.233 --> 12:55.269
Hey! I hate to break up the party,
but isn't there somebody missing?

12:55.269 --> 12:59.876
- How do you mean?
- Well, Lister, female opposite.

12:59.876 --> 13:03.236
Rimmer, female opposite. Where's mine?

13:03.236 --> 13:06.517
Oh. Mooching around the cargo decks, I think.

13:06.517 --> 13:12.277
Aow! all my life I've waited
for this moment, and now it has arrived!

13:12.277 --> 13:18.469
Hey, if you hear me screaming,
do NOT come to the rescue!

13:18.469 --> 13:19.469
Aow!

13:20.640 --> 13:23.632
# I'm gonna get you, little chickie... #

13:23.632 --> 13:27.110
- I think he's in for a shock.
- Why?

13:27.110 --> 13:30.272
- His opposite isn't female.
- What is it?

13:30.272 --> 13:32.351
It's a dog.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.879
Boy, oh, boy! Where'd they go?

13:36.879 --> 13:41.238
I get so dang panicky
when they leave me on my own.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.390
Damn these fleas!

13:43.600 --> 13:46.433
# I'm gonna get you, little chickie,

13:46.433 --> 13:50.035
# I'm gonna get you, little... #

13:54.480 --> 13:59.952
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure he wants to eat me.

14:00.720 --> 14:05.236
Well, trash my shorts, what a funny-looking dog!

14:05.236 --> 14:08.118
I'd better make myself look big!

14:08.840 --> 14:11.115
Put it there, Buddy...

14:11.115 --> 14:15.557
God! What kind of toothpaste
does he use? Rotting meat flavour?

14:15.557 --> 14:19.269
Come on, now. I wanna be your buddy!

14:19.269 --> 14:24.593
Tell you what, I'm gonna smell
your behind, then you can smell mine!

14:24.593 --> 14:28.992
- Now, is that a deal?
- You wanna smell my WHAT?!

14:28.992 --> 14:32.197
Why, sure! Don't you wanna smell me?

14:32.197 --> 14:37.559
Man, I could smell you if you was on Mars!
When did you last take a bath?

14:37.559 --> 14:40.234
- Don't say that word!
- What? Bath?

14:40.234 --> 14:46.236
You said it again! Now, listen up.
If y'all gonna say that word, spell it.

14:46.236 --> 14:50.154
When did you last take a B-A-T-H?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.671
What's that?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.720
Yo, Cat... There you are.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.758
- We're going to the disco.
- What?

14:58.758 --> 15:02.116
It'll take 17 hours to repair the Hop Drive,

15:02.116 --> 15:05.875
so I thought we'd have a few...bevvies.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.713
Yeah! Come on! Aow!

15:12.400 --> 15:14.914
(DISCO MUSIC)

15:39.120 --> 15:41.429
They seem to be getting on.

15:41.429 --> 15:44.512
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Oh, yes.

15:44.512 --> 15:49.196
- Like a house on fire.
- You can say that again.

15:49.196 --> 15:53.319
Mind you, we've got a good conversation
going on here.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.311
Oh, yes, yes.

15:55.311 --> 15:57.391
Absolutely.

15:57.391 --> 16:01.712
Funny. I'm not normally good
at talking to the opposite sex.

16:01.712 --> 16:05.190
I'm not. I run out of things to say.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.231
Me, too.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.031
So, you're a girl, then?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.394
- Yes.
- That's nice.

16:23.394 --> 16:27.758
Hang on. Haven't you got something in your eye?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.151
You're trying to hypnotise me!

16:32.151 --> 16:35.312
- Of course not.
- Stop staring, then.

16:35.312 --> 16:39.871
OK! I read it that it's great for picking up totty.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.798
Well, I'd hardly describe myself as "totty".

16:45.640 --> 16:47.995
Oh, yes!

16:47.995 --> 16:51.993
Totty, totty...totty.

16:51.993 --> 16:55.993
You've had too much to drink. I get like this.

16:55.993 --> 16:58.310
Come on. You're interested.

16:58.310 --> 17:02.029
- I'm not.
- Why are you giving me the signs?

17:02.029 --> 17:05.556
- What signs?
- Wearing such tight trousers?

17:05.556 --> 17:08.915
- They're not tight.
- You're begging for it.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.792
I'm not "totty" and I'm not begging for anything.

17:13.792 --> 17:18.635
Give us a snog, I won't try
to take off your underpants.

17:18.635 --> 17:22.598
I'm sorry, I'm just not that kind of...boy.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.517
Frigid!

17:29.040 --> 17:31.838
You're disgusting! You're only after one thing!

17:31.838 --> 17:34.388
Why? How many have you got?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.591
You're a great conversationalist.

17:40.591 --> 17:44.992
- But I ain't said nothin' yet...
- That's what I like best.

17:44.992 --> 17:48.629
- I'm going to the bar?
- I'll have a grenade.

17:48.629 --> 17:52.030
- A grenade?
- Yeah. I wanna play fetch.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.392
Listie! How are you, my old mate.

18:00.392 --> 18:03.040
Please, God, come and join us!

18:03.600 --> 18:05.591
I won't be long.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.273
If you want to keep your beer cool,
stick it between his legs.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.390
What was all that about?

18:17.390 --> 18:21.109
- That's the most awful woman I ever met.
- She's you.

18:21.109 --> 18:23.191
She's absolutely repugnant.

18:23.191 --> 18:28.877
She treats me like some sort
of discardable sex object.

18:28.877 --> 18:33.670
- She's the female equivalent of you.
- Nonsense. She's maladjusted.

18:33.670 --> 18:39.153
Trust me to get El Weirdo,
while you get the one with the juicy jugs.

18:39.153 --> 18:44.314
See! She thinks of men
the exact same way you think of women.

18:44.314 --> 18:48.439
She accused me of wiggling my bottom
in a provocative way.

18:48.439 --> 18:51.956
I was just walking! I can't help being sexy.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.473
- What's the other one like?
- Totally gross.

18:55.473 --> 18:58.074
She's unbelievable. She tried to impress me

18:58.074 --> 19:02.233
by drinking six pints of lager,
then belching "Yankee Doodle Dandy".

19:03.320 --> 19:05.390
That's your party piece, isn't it?

19:05.390 --> 19:08.597
Yeah, but when I do it, it's stylish.

19:08.597 --> 19:10.477
(BELCHES)

19:10.477 --> 19:12.357
Class.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.795
- Do you think you'll, er...?
- What?

19:16.795 --> 19:18.871
Get outta town!

19:18.871 --> 19:24.398
She's a good laugh, but all she does
is get blitzed and eat vindaloos.

19:24.398 --> 19:28.359
Call me crazy,
but I just don't find that attractive.

19:28.359 --> 19:31.796
- How's it going?
- Put it this way,

19:31.796 --> 19:35.714
there'll be two pairs of shoes
under the bed tonight.

19:35.714 --> 19:37.631
Wallop!

19:37.631 --> 19:43.192
He doesn't look too interested to me.
He looks more, er...petrified.

19:43.192 --> 19:48.274
He doesn't want me to think
he's the ship's bike, but I'm getting the signs.

19:48.274 --> 19:54.071
He crossed his legs and made sure I saw
that he was wearing sock suspenders.

19:54.071 --> 19:59.871
- Rimmer, he's not interested.
- Wait till I give him the wormdo line.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.791
Hey, do you want to dance?

20:02.791 --> 20:08.273
I tell you, when I hit the dance floor,
I am one mean turkey! Do you dance?

20:08.273 --> 20:12.638
Do I dance? Does Carmen Miranda wear fruit?

20:13.800 --> 20:16.997
Alrighty! You lead on, boy.

20:16.997 --> 20:19.913
Hold this, Fido.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.994
You call that dancing? No way, José!

20:29.994 --> 20:32.071
This is dancing!

20:37.600 --> 20:39.192
(HOWLS)

20:39.192 --> 20:41.271
Well, whaddya say, huh?

20:44.880 --> 20:49.795
- Oh, eh. Another dead heat.
- That's eight on the run.

20:49.795 --> 20:53.156
- I want to speak to Holly.
- Sure.

20:53.156 --> 20:55.879
Holly, how long before the Hop Drive's fixed?

20:55.879 --> 21:00.272
We're busy fixing it right now, aren't we, Hilly?

21:00.272 --> 21:03.955
Yes, Holly, That's exactly what we're doing,

21:03.955 --> 21:08.238
- What's that mark on your face?
- What face?

21:08.238 --> 21:12.677
- The lipstick mark.
- That's a computer rash,

21:12.677 --> 21:15.433
Holly, just get me out of here.

21:15.433 --> 21:18.751
What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?

21:18.751 --> 21:20.876
A good time?!

21:20.876 --> 21:22.951
Lister... (CLEARS THROAT)

21:22.951 --> 21:26.749
I'm going to bed now, on my own, alone.

21:26.749 --> 21:30.196
If she comes back, say I've got a headache.

21:30.196 --> 21:33.875
- Where's she gone?
- To get some sexy videos.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.555
She thinks seeing two men together
might turn me on.

21:37.555 --> 21:41.679
- Where are you sleeping?
- I'm not telling you.

21:41.679 --> 21:47.198
- Are you a man or a munchkin?
- # I'm off to see the wizard... #

21:50.040 --> 21:53.635
You ready, then? OK, after three... Three!

21:53.635 --> 21:55.517
Ha! Beat you!

22:10.240 --> 22:13.994
Oh, did I get drunk or did I get drunk?

22:16.280 --> 22:18.077
Oh, no.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.159
Oh, did I get drunk or did I get drunk?

22:23.159 --> 22:23.909
Hi.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.473
- Hi.
- Listen. Did we...?

22:28.160 --> 22:30.151
I can't remember.

22:30.151 --> 22:36.429
I remember betting you I could
climb the disco wall using only me lips...

22:38.040 --> 22:42.795
And then... Oh, God,
I juggled the goldfish, didn't I?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.517
Blindfold.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.837
Then...

22:48.840 --> 22:50.990
Oh, eh. We did, didn't we?

22:50.990 --> 22:53.799
You pieces of filth.

22:53.799 --> 22:57.589
How could you commit an act
of carnal knowledge...?

22:57.589 --> 23:00.911
..on my bunk, on my sheets, using my springs?

23:00.911 --> 23:04.151
How could you contemplate
making love to yourself?

23:04.151 --> 23:07.949
Well, why break a habit of a lifetime?

23:09.240 --> 23:12.676
Leave it out! I was out of me skull.

23:12.676 --> 23:14.876
What's that supposed to mean?

23:14.876 --> 23:19.351
I wouldn't have slept with you
if I'd known what I was doing.

23:19.351 --> 23:22.591
- Thanks!
- I hope you get pregnant.

23:22.591 --> 23:26.036
No offence, but you're not exactly difficult to pull.

23:26.036 --> 23:28.111
Talk about a pushover!

23:28.111 --> 23:31.954
That's rich coming from Miss Yo-Yo Knickers.

23:33.880 --> 23:38.351
I hope you get pregnant, you cheap little tart!

23:38.351 --> 23:41.512
- You what?
- How can he get pregnant?

23:41.512 --> 23:45.195
Unless they used precautions,
he could be up the spout.

23:45.195 --> 23:49.637
- But it's women who get pregnant!
- Since when?

23:49.637 --> 23:52.951
Since always! Me mother was a woman!

23:52.951 --> 23:56.112
Oh, Listie!

23:56.112 --> 23:59.476
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

23:59.476 --> 24:04.634
If I'm understanding correctly,
it appears that in their universe,

24:04.634 --> 24:07.678
it's men who give birth to babies.

24:07.678 --> 24:14.199
As we are in their universe, you could
well possibly be up the duff, laddie!

24:15.440 --> 24:19.718
- This is a wind-up.
- Don't get upset in your condition!

24:21.360 --> 24:25.399
It's impossible! I haven't got the...
the equipment, have I?

24:25.399 --> 24:29.075
You're in our universe. Our physical law applies.

24:29.075 --> 24:31.958
Holly, tell me this isn't true.

24:31.958 --> 24:37.398
- I'm afraid it is,,,Mum,
- How could you do this to me?

24:37.398 --> 24:41.314
- Do what?
- Fertilise me. Take advantage of me,

24:41.314 --> 24:44.756
knowing that I didn't have precautions.

24:44.756 --> 24:50.073
I assumed you'd taken care of that.
It's the man's responsibility.

24:50.073 --> 24:55.439
It's the man who gets pregnant,
who suffers the agony of childbirth.

24:55.439 --> 24:58.717
Agony? This gets better and better!

24:58.717 --> 25:04.875
- What can I do? I'm sorry, OK?
- Sorry? That's it? Sorry?

25:04.875 --> 25:07.155
Wham, bam, thank you, mister?

25:08.520 --> 25:12.718
Well, there's no point arguing,
If it's happened, it's happened,

25:12.718 --> 25:15.837
We'd better get back, I've fixed the Hop Drive,

25:15.837 --> 25:19.469
We can't! She could be the father of my child!

25:19.469 --> 25:23.315
- If we don 't go now, we're stuck,
- Listen...

25:23.315 --> 25:26.836
Just because it's possible for you to get pregnant,

25:26.836 --> 25:29.753
it doesn't necessarily mean that you are.

25:29.753 --> 25:31.831
You might get lucky.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.310
But then again, you might not.

25:40.310 --> 25:43.756
We'll find out when we get back, won't we?

25:43.756 --> 25:45.911
Engaging Holly Hop,,,

25:45.911 --> 25:47.991
Holly Hop engaged,

25:47.991 --> 25:50.913
Four,,, Three,,, One,,, Blast off,

25:57.400 --> 26:01.791
I don't know why I'm doing this.
It's just not possible!

26:01.791 --> 26:04.758
Why not? Male baboons have given birth.

26:04.758 --> 26:09.595
They were doing that as far back
as the 20th century. Caesarean, naturally.

26:09.595 --> 26:11.875

AND THUDDING SOUNDS)

You'll be in good hands.
The skutters can handle it.

26:17.314 --> 26:21.598
Skutters?! I wouldn't let them
open a can of beans.

26:21.598 --> 26:24.148
You're thinking too negative!

26:24.148 --> 26:29.439
Think of all the glorious, beautiful,
wondrous things about having children!

26:29.439 --> 26:32.159
- Like?
- When they leave home.

26:33.680 --> 26:38.071
- What colour should it turn?
- Blue for not pregnant...which it will.

26:38.071 --> 26:40.310
- And red for pregnant?
- Yeah.

26:40.310 --> 26:43.198
Come on, you reds!

26:43.960 --> 26:47.191
- What colour is it now?
- Still white.

26:47.191 --> 26:52.957
Oi, Remember when we broke the light
barrier and saw echoes from the future?

26:52.957 --> 26:56.635
- Yeah.
- Your future self had twin boys,

26:56.635 --> 27:00.759
Right. I said, "How could you get
two babies on board?"

27:00.759 --> 27:04.879
And you said, "It'll be a lot of fun finding out."

27:04.879 --> 27:08.953
- How right you were, Listie!
- Twins? No way!

27:08.953 --> 27:12.635
Oh, yes! Big, strapping boys they were, as well.

27:12.635 --> 27:14.711
Huge heads.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.915
- It's changing colour!
- What colour?

27:17.915 --> 27:20.150
- It's changing!
- What colour?

27:20.150 --> 27:23.391
- Yes, it's changing.
- Blue for not pregnant, right?

27:23.391 --> 27:26.040
- Yes!
- Oh, excellent news, Listie!

27:26.040 --> 27:29.078
- Oh, thank God!
- I'm going to be an uncle.
