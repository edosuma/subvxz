WEBVTT

01:09.044 --> 01:10.462
Thank you.

01:11.922 --> 01:15.593
Whether I turn out to be the hero
of my own story

01:15.634 --> 01:18.762
or whether that station will be held
by anybody else...

01:20.681 --> 01:22.308
...these moments must show.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.480
<i>I entered the world at The Rookery.</i>

01:30.733 --> 01:32.109
Peggotty!

01:32.151 --> 01:34.278
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.197
As I promised.
Peggotty promised, see?

01:43.913 --> 01:46.790
I'm coming, my love.
Just give me three seconds.

01:46.832 --> 01:48.000
Three seconds is too long.

01:51.462 --> 01:55.007
<i>Where are the towels?</i>

01:55.049 --> 01:56.967
OK. Why do I have this?

01:57.009 --> 02:00.262
I'm panicking. I'm completely panicking.
Peggotty, you daft mare.

02:03.599 --> 02:05.768
<i>Now, Peggotty!</i>

02:05.809 --> 02:08.811
I'll be with you in 45 seconds, 45.

02:08.853 --> 02:10.648
Peggotty!

02:10.689 --> 02:15.110
Just breathe. Just keep breathing, my love.
I'll be back in two breaths.

02:15.152 --> 02:17.112
Peggotty!

02:20.449 --> 02:23.077
- Just try to pretend it doesn't hurt.
- It does.

02:23.118 --> 02:24.662
I know.

02:24.703 --> 02:26.163
To begin my life...

02:27.790 --> 02:29.833
...with the beginning of my life.

02:31.001 --> 02:33.128
Mrs David Copperfield, I think?

02:33.712 --> 02:36.882
- Miss Trotwood. You've heard of her?
- Yes.

02:37.466 --> 02:39.760
Yes, I believe I've had that pleasure.

02:40.344 --> 02:41.971
Well...

02:42.012 --> 02:43.264
Now you see her.

02:44.556 --> 02:46.642
Might I ask, why Rookery?

02:47.476 --> 02:52.189
When my husband bought the house,
he liked to think there were rooks about it.

02:52.231 --> 02:54.692
- And are there?
- No!

02:55.734 --> 02:58.028
My late brother all over.

02:58.654 --> 03:01.949
Calls a house a rookery,
takes the rooks on trust.

03:02.908 --> 03:05.828
A better name would have been
Gullible Manor.

03:05.869 --> 03:08.706
- Will this person be stopping, ma'am?
- Now, Peggotty.

03:08.747 --> 03:11.166
Peggotty? Peggotty? Peggotty?

03:11.208 --> 03:14.712
You mean to say a human being went into a church
and had herself named Peggotty?

03:14.753 --> 03:17.131
Did your mother sneeze
when you were christened?

03:17.172 --> 03:19.341
- Sorry, what was your name?
- Trotwood.

03:19.383 --> 03:23.387
Trotwood. It's funny because I thought your name
was Pot Kettle Black when you walked in,

03:23.429 --> 03:25.014
but never mind.

03:25.055 --> 03:27.266
Ah! Here she comes.
Here comes the girl.

03:28.350 --> 03:32.396
- Or it could be... a boy!
- Oh, no, no, no. She will be a girl.

03:32.438 --> 03:33.772
Certain to be a girl.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.401
And, may I beg you, you will call her
Betsey Trotwood Copperfield

03:37.443 --> 03:39.278
and I will be her godmother.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.324
And there will be no mistakes
in the life of this Betsey Trotwood.

03:43.365 --> 03:46.535
There will be no trifling
with her affections, poor dear.

03:48.871 --> 03:51.248
Bless me, you're very young.

03:52.416 --> 03:53.751
We need a nurse and a doctor.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.837
- We're here.
- Hello.

03:56.879 --> 03:59.965
- Come on, my love.
- Nice and slow.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.093
- We're going to need towels.
- I have lots of towels.

04:03.135 --> 04:06.263
Go nice and slow.
Very good, very good.

04:15.272 --> 04:19.610
I record that I was born on a Friday
at 12 o'clock at night.

04:22.196 --> 04:25.157
- Is that it? Is it over?
- Wonderful news! Fabulous news!

04:25.199 --> 04:28.494
- Doctor, tell Miss Trotwood the news.
- How is she, Doctor?

04:28.535 --> 04:31.455
She is as comfortable
as any young mother can be.

04:31.497 --> 04:33.707
No, I mean how is she, the baby?
How is she?

04:33.749 --> 04:36.710
It's a boy, ma'am.
I'm very happy to congratulate you.

04:36.752 --> 04:41.131
Why congratulate? The boy is the first of twins
and his sister being born as we speak?

04:41.173 --> 04:43.759
No. It's just one boy.

04:54.270 --> 04:55.271
Ludicrous.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.451
Look at you, Baby Davy.

05:09.493 --> 05:11.120
Face like a peach.

05:11.161 --> 05:13.414
I'm very fond of peaches.

05:13.455 --> 05:16.000
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

05:16.041 --> 05:20.004
I remember Peggotty's rough fingers,
like a pocket nutmeg grater.

05:22.047 --> 05:24.216
Are you smiling?

05:24.258 --> 05:25.801
Almost there.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.180
<i>Everything looked
terribly tall to me.</i>

05:31.849 --> 05:33.309
Charge!

05:35.269 --> 05:39.231
Take this,
you naughty monster rabbit!

05:42.985 --> 05:45.404
I see my father's gravestone,

05:45.446 --> 05:48.115
shadowed by trees
bending to one another in the wind,

05:49.325 --> 05:52.119
like giants whispering secrets.

05:53.287 --> 05:58.375
"Crocodiles can be found in Africa,
the Americas and Australia."

05:58.417 --> 06:02.004
- What a remarkable vegetable.
- Not vegetable, reptile.

06:02.046 --> 06:05.257
No, I tell you, a crocodile is a potato.

06:05.299 --> 06:08.636
It has some scales
and they have spikes.

06:08.677 --> 06:11.138
Well, what a world
of gammon and spinach it is.

06:12.514 --> 06:15.226
<i>I can easily recall
people of strong character...</i>

06:15.267 --> 06:18.479
What did Peggotty say when you were little,
the one you liked?

06:18.520 --> 06:22.900
- A world of gammon and spinach.
- That's a good one. I'll put that one down.

06:23.442 --> 06:25.527
Do you remember everything she says?

06:26.445 --> 06:27.780
It's hard to forget.

06:28.530 --> 06:29.531
That's true.

06:30.324 --> 06:33.911
<i>...and weave their memory
into the life I was about to lead.</i>

06:40.042 --> 06:44.088
- All packed for the journey, Peggotty?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:44.129 --> 06:45.589
Uh, here.

06:45.631 --> 06:50.219
You should always go in the middle, Davy,
if you want to win noughts and crosses.

06:50.261 --> 06:53.806
The gentleman is here, ma'am,
with the black hair and particular manner

06:53.847 --> 06:55.808
who walked you home
from church on Sunday.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.726
Yes, thank you, Peggotty.

07:01.939 --> 07:05.067
- Are these your famous geraniums?
- Indeed they are.

07:06.318 --> 07:07.611
Oh.

07:07.653 --> 07:09.738
- Do come in.
- Ah!

07:09.780 --> 07:13.409
- Carrot down.
- You must be the man of the house.

07:13.993 --> 07:15.619
I'm a boy, sir.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.164
Dear boy.
Come, shake my hand.

07:23.252 --> 07:25.838
Well, no, that's the wrong hand,
isn't it, boy?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.089
Davy.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.262
Well, maybe your way will catch on, hm?

07:33.846 --> 07:35.431
You're a very brave boy.

07:35.472 --> 07:38.475
Davy, my sweet potato.

07:38.517 --> 07:41.061
Let's take you to Yarmouth.

07:41.103 --> 07:42.980
My brother is driving us there.

07:48.944 --> 07:51.405
Look at all that sky, eh, Davy boy.

07:51.447 --> 07:54.033
That's too much sky, innit?
Even for a bird.

07:55.409 --> 07:59.496
If the world is really as round
as my geography book says it is,

07:59.538 --> 08:01.790
how can this bit of it be so flat?

08:01.832 --> 08:03.292
Not to your liking, Davy?

08:03.876 --> 08:06.629
There's a molehill there, look.
That ain't flat.

08:07.338 --> 08:11.634
- There's a bird there. That ain't flat.
- A flower there. That ain't flat.

08:11.675 --> 08:14.970
It's flat here,
it's flat here and it's flat, OK?

08:18.432 --> 08:20.935
All right, maybe you're right.
It is a bit flat.

08:21.644 --> 08:23.562
Ooh, nearly at the harbour.

08:25.397 --> 08:27.358
That's where
Ham and Emily work.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.952
It's four. I've done my gutting.

08:37.993 --> 08:40.704
It's four already?
These are ready to go, yeah.

08:40.745 --> 08:41.956
Hey!

08:45.084 --> 08:46.293
There we go.

08:46.335 --> 08:50.881
I turn my back for a second, Ham,
and you sprout like a beanstalk.

08:50.923 --> 08:54.301
Oh, I forgot how hard you squeeze, Peggotty.

08:54.343 --> 08:58.305
- You'll have the marrow out my bones.
- She's a human mangle, that woman.

08:58.347 --> 09:00.641
Master Davy, Ham.
Ham, Master Davy.

09:00.683 --> 09:04.311
- Pleased to meet you, Ham.
- I'm... Master Davy.

09:04.353 --> 09:07.231
Likewise. Let's show you
where we live, eh?

09:07.273 --> 09:09.358
- Is Emily here?
- No, it's four. She's...

09:09.400 --> 09:11.360
- She's done gutting.
- Yeah, done gutting.

09:11.402 --> 09:13.946
Davy, hop up. Come on.

09:16.031 --> 09:17.950
Careful with him.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.952
Wait till you see this.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.207
That's where we all live, Davy boy.

09:25.249 --> 09:27.918
- It's amazing.
- It's no mansion.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.754
It's a downside-upside capsized boat.

09:30.796 --> 09:32.131
It's Aladdin's palace!

09:32.673 --> 09:35.593
We'll be like spiders
trapped under a teacup!

09:36.885 --> 09:38.804
Digs for joy, that boy.
Finds it too.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.394
Peggotty.

09:46.478 --> 09:49.064
This place is amazing.

09:49.106 --> 09:50.524
Davy, come look at this.

09:51.442 --> 09:55.654
- And this is where you'll be sleeping.
- Do you like it, then, Davy?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.990
Yeah, what do you think,
Master Copperfield?

09:58.032 --> 10:02.369
I think this is the most desirable bedroom
I've ever seen.

10:02.411 --> 10:03.913
Desirable.

10:03.954 --> 10:06.081
I love your words, Davy.

10:06.916 --> 10:12.046
- Peggotty says your mother's a lady.
- Emily, mind your manners! This is Emily.

10:12.087 --> 10:13.589
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:15.758 --> 10:18.802
Are Ham and Emily your children?

10:18.844 --> 10:22.514
No, they're adopted.
Both their fathers was drownded.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.851
Oh, Ham.
Not another mouth to feed!

10:27.228 --> 10:31.023
Let me die and be a riddance.

10:31.065 --> 10:34.652
That's Mrs Gummidge.
Her husband drownded too.

10:35.486 --> 10:37.363
There's a lot of drownding goes on.

10:37.404 --> 10:41.700
How's that? You can't complain
about a nice bit of kipper.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.118
You just watch her.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.789
Potatoes are burnt, like coals.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.041
There she goes.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.921
These potatoes could be my last.

10:53.963 --> 10:57.549
- Can I go out onto the beach, Uncle?
- Well, have you done your gutting?

10:57.591 --> 11:01.637
- Yes, I've done my gutting. Finished at four.
- There's a six-o'clock gutting as well.

11:01.679 --> 11:04.807
- Fish do go off, you know.
- Ham, I've been gutting fish since dawn.

11:04.848 --> 11:08.060
- You need to get gutting till it's finished.
- Never mind about that.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.479
Go on, but take young Davy with you.

11:10.521 --> 11:12.314
Come on.

11:12.356 --> 11:15.109
Mind you don't get drownded.

11:17.403 --> 11:19.530
What's gutting?

11:19.572 --> 11:22.700
Unless you want hands like mine,
you don't wanna know.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.743
Come on.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.455
<i>Is your mother really a lady?</i>

11:29.707 --> 11:32.001
Uh, yes, I think so.

11:32.793 --> 11:37.131
Does she attend to her correspondence
and receive callers in the drawing room?

11:37.172 --> 11:38.674
I don't know.

11:39.675 --> 11:43.220
A gentleman with big hands
calls to admire our geranium.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.141
I should like to become a lady.

11:47.182 --> 11:49.226
He has two eyebrows.

11:49.977 --> 11:54.356
I say eyebrows rather than eyes
cos they're much more important in his face.

11:55.858 --> 11:57.401
Yeah.

12:03.073 --> 12:06.785
Look! Look at this, Davy.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.829
You can see past Yarmouth.

12:08.871 --> 12:13.250
Emily, get down!
You'll smash in 20 pieces if you slip off there.

12:13.292 --> 12:15.628
- Hello, Ham!
- I'm not scared.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.964
- Hello, Davy. You having a good day?
- Yeah.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.847
<i>Dear Mama,</i>

12:26.889 --> 12:32.895
<i>Yarmouth is, upon the whole,
the finest place in the universe.</i>

12:36.273 --> 12:38.776
<i>Emily has taught me to skim stones</i>

12:39.485 --> 12:41.987
<i>and I'm only sorry you cannot see it.</i>

12:45.199 --> 12:48.661
<i>She and Ham have become
the best friends imaginable.</i>

12:54.792 --> 12:56.752
What? What?

12:57.461 --> 13:01.173
I told them what we decided
between us, our news.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.801
- Getting engaged?
- Getting engaged, yeah.

13:03.842 --> 13:06.345
- You can just say "getting engaged".
- We're engaged.

13:09.014 --> 13:13.269
- Are you happy for us, Uncle?
- Happy? I'll tell you how happy I am.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.604
I'm happy as a dog with two bones.

13:15.646 --> 13:19.608
And as the owner who discovers

13:19.650 --> 13:23.988
that the hole the bones was dug from
is full of gold watches.

13:24.572 --> 13:26.740
- Oh, oh, and money!
- And money.

13:26.782 --> 13:28.784
Yeah, that's how happy I am.

13:28.826 --> 13:31.120
- Everybody should get married.
- Yeah!

13:32.413 --> 13:33.872
Let's be having you!

13:45.509 --> 13:46.927
What have you got there?

13:48.596 --> 13:50.097
It's a boathouse, sir.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.350
A house made from a boat.

13:54.518 --> 13:57.271
Draw a house or draw a boat.

13:57.855 --> 13:59.273
None of this nonsense.

14:00.024 --> 14:01.358
Welcome back, Davy.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.403
Mrs Copperfield,
is that a new ring or your proper one?

14:04.445 --> 14:06.447
Yes, you must congratulate us.

14:07.907 --> 14:10.284
Davy, you have a pa.

14:10.326 --> 14:12.745
- A new one.
- A new pa?

14:12.786 --> 14:15.956
- Yes, your mother and I are now married.
- I meant to tell you sooner.

14:15.998 --> 14:19.543
Now, you just addressed my wife
by a surname that is not hers.

14:19.585 --> 14:22.212
She is now Mrs Murdstone.
Will you remember that?

14:23.380 --> 14:24.590
Sister.

14:26.383 --> 14:27.885
Jane Murdstone.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.765
Jane, my wife, Clara Murdstone.

14:35.351 --> 14:36.852
A fair choice.

14:37.686 --> 14:39.730
I regret I missed the wedding

14:39.772 --> 14:42.733
and the chance to meet you
at the peak of your beauty.

14:43.651 --> 14:44.777
A boy.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.571
I presume it is named?

14:47.613 --> 14:50.699
I'm David, Miss Murdstone.
How do you do?

14:50.741 --> 14:53.160
My question
was not directed at you, child.

14:54.370 --> 14:55.996
Wants manners.

15:15.099 --> 15:17.476
The parlour's rather bright, I thought.

15:18.227 --> 15:20.729
- Well, it's south-facing.
- I'll take care of it.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.362
There she is.

15:29.780 --> 15:32.783
I'm Miss Murdstone
and I go through every single cupboard.

15:32.825 --> 15:36.120
Look in that cupboard,
look in that cupboard, look in that cupboard.

15:36.912 --> 15:39.582
She looks
like she's made of wax.

15:39.623 --> 15:42.793
- Or Dutch cheese.
- Is that one of yours?

15:42.835 --> 15:44.837
- You should write that down.
- Later.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.088
Davy boy.

15:47.131 --> 15:48.632
Time for your lesson.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.304
And verbs have two voices:

15:53.345 --> 15:56.056
one active,

15:56.098 --> 15:58.392
two, um...

15:59.727 --> 16:01.395
- Clara!
- Jane.

16:01.437 --> 16:03.606
We should switch
to a less enjoyable activity.

16:03.647 --> 16:04.648
Jane!

16:06.358 --> 16:07.443
Oh, Davy, Davy.

16:07.484 --> 16:10.988
No, don't say, "Oh, Davy, Davy".
He either knows his lesson or he does not.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.489
- He does not.
- Jane!

16:21.290 --> 16:23.667
Pick it up. Read it to me.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.297
Sometime today, boy!

16:29.924 --> 16:31.133
Sorry, sir.

16:31.175 --> 16:33.969
I can't when you're watching me.

16:34.011 --> 16:35.137
It's...

16:35.179 --> 16:39.266
The words have skates and skim away.
I'm very stupid.

16:39.308 --> 16:42.394
- You'd as soon as teach the furniture.
- Jane Murdstone, silence!

16:42.436 --> 16:45.189
- You're not stupid, just nervous.
- Clara Murdstone, silence!

16:45.231 --> 16:47.524
Clara Copperfield, sir!

16:57.243 --> 16:58.410
- Edward.
- Come on.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.579
- Edward, please, no.
- Clara. Come on, boy.

17:00.621 --> 17:03.707
- Let your husband improve your son.
- Edward, please!

17:03.748 --> 17:04.958
No. Get off me.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.919
David. Wait. Davy.

17:06.961 --> 17:09.170
Now, whenever I have
an obstinate dog or horse,

17:09.213 --> 17:11.090
I beat him, hm?

17:11.131 --> 17:15.427
I conquer him, even if it costs him
every last drop of blood he has.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.890
I'm trying to learn, sir, but I can't
when you and Miss Murdstone are watching me!

17:19.932 --> 17:21.559
Oh, can't you indeed?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.704
- Edward, please stop!
- Clara!

17:41.745 --> 17:44.707
- Let me break the door down, Mrs Copperfield.
- Mrs Murdstone.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.333
Jane!

17:46.375 --> 17:48.419
- Edward is teaching.
- Jane!

17:48.460 --> 17:49.753
Let him teach.

18:10.608 --> 18:12.192
What's to become of me?

18:12.234 --> 18:14.987
- You're to be sent away.
- To school?

18:15.571 --> 18:18.782
Education, boy, is costly.

18:21.452 --> 18:24.914
What lies before you
is a fight with the world.

18:26.165 --> 18:28.375
And the sooner you begin it, the better!

18:55.027 --> 18:59.240
OK, so, cork with the hand corker, yeah?
Pass it to Mealy Potatoes.

18:59.281 --> 19:03.035
He labels. Five a minute
or old Creakle hangs your guts out for bunting.

19:03.619 --> 19:04.954
Come on, let's go.

19:04.995 --> 19:06.872
Pull. Just pull it.

19:08.499 --> 19:10.501
- Just pull it.
- He's so tiny!

19:11.460 --> 19:14.046
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
Where are you living?

19:14.088 --> 19:18.634
I'm lodging with the Micawber family,
whom I'm yet to meet.

19:18.676 --> 19:22.054
"Whom I'm yet to meet?"
Where were you brung up? Windsor Castle?

19:23.681 --> 19:25.140
Here, practise.

19:27.101 --> 19:28.310
Quiet!

19:28.352 --> 19:29.478
Quiet!

19:33.023 --> 19:34.525
I said quiet, didn't I?

19:35.484 --> 19:36.819
I didn't say stop working!

19:38.779 --> 19:41.407
- Who broke the bottle?
- It was him, sir.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.617
Breaking bottles?
On your first day?

19:45.119 --> 19:47.121
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You're sorry, are you?

19:47.162 --> 19:48.789
We'll find out about sorry.

19:53.294 --> 19:55.671
- You know my rules.
- Rules.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.216
- Half a day's pay per bottle.
- Per bottle.

20:05.055 --> 20:08.392
The famous biting boy. Here.

20:08.434 --> 20:09.935
Biting boy. Here.

20:11.604 --> 20:14.148
I have the happiness
of knowing your step... father.

20:14.189 --> 20:15.524
Step... father.

20:15.566 --> 20:18.903
- A man of a strong character.
- 'aracter.

20:25.242 --> 20:28.037
- Tie it to him, Tungay.
- To him, Tungay.

20:29.747 --> 20:31.165
That's me. Sorry.

20:43.677 --> 20:47.556
Look at the writing on his back.
What's it say?

20:48.474 --> 20:49.808
It says he bites.

21:11.914 --> 21:14.041
Hey! Open the door!

21:14.083 --> 21:16.585
You can't get away!

21:16.627 --> 21:19.213
Swindler!
We know you're in there!

21:20.547 --> 21:23.968
- Come on, Micawber!
- Micawber, are you in there?

21:24.009 --> 21:26.136
Come on, open the door!
Take it off its hinges!

21:27.304 --> 21:30.516
Come on, Micawber!
Open the door now!

21:30.557 --> 21:31.684
Are you Mr Micawber?

21:32.810 --> 21:35.604
- Are you Master Copperfield?
- I am indeed.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.774
How do you do, Master Copperfield?

21:39.650 --> 21:42.444
- Very good.
- Master Copperfield,

21:42.486 --> 21:45.781
it would be of material assistance to me
if you would join those gentlemen,

21:45.823 --> 21:47.575
echo their slanderous cries,

21:47.616 --> 21:51.662
and then enunciate the following:
"'Ere, round the back. He's flittin'."

21:51.704 --> 21:52.871
Here, round the back...

21:53.539 --> 21:54.873
- 'Ere.
- Here.

21:54.915 --> 21:57.251
Ear, as in the aural organ.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.337
- Ear.
- 'Ere. Round the back.

22:00.379 --> 22:02.172
- Mm-hm.
- He's flitting.

22:02.214 --> 22:04.300
- Flittin'.
- Flittin'.

22:04.341 --> 22:07.595
Precisely. Splendid.
Now, there's no time like the present.

22:09.054 --> 22:10.389
Open up!

22:11.181 --> 22:12.766
Come on!

22:12.808 --> 22:15.769
Pay up the money, please!

22:15.811 --> 22:19.815
- Micawber!
- 'Ere! Round the back. 'E's...

22:19.857 --> 22:21.859
- What?
- ...flittin'.

22:21.901 --> 22:23.777
Flittin', is he? Micawber!

22:24.403 --> 22:27.740
There he is!
Micawber, come here, you!

22:29.408 --> 22:31.285
We'll be back tomorrow, Micawber.

22:31.327 --> 22:35.080
- You can't hide forever.
- You haven't got away with this.

22:37.917 --> 22:40.294
A bravura performance,
Master Copperfield.

22:40.336 --> 22:44.048
Welcome.
Welcome to our humble home.

22:44.089 --> 22:45.799
- Who are the...?
- Those are, um...

22:45.841 --> 22:50.346
Jackals is what they are! Hyenas!
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

22:50.387 --> 22:53.557
This woman is the apple of my eye,
Master Copperfield.

22:53.599 --> 22:57.436
The lodestar upon whom
the sextant of my heart is set.

22:57.478 --> 22:59.521
In short, my wife.

22:59.563 --> 23:01.106
- How do you do?
- Ooh.

23:01.148 --> 23:04.526
- I'm owed for candles. Pay me.
- On your way. You will be paid.

23:04.568 --> 23:07.571
- Clock. Clock.
- No, give me that clock.

23:07.613 --> 23:09.865
Hands off, you horrible creature.

23:10.574 --> 23:12.743
- Clock, very valuable.
- Micawber!

23:12.785 --> 23:14.370
- Micawber!
- Leave me alone!

23:15.120 --> 23:17.831
- Thank you.
- No! No! No!

23:19.792 --> 23:23.003
Oh, right, that's it!

23:23.712 --> 23:25.339
That is it!

23:25.381 --> 23:27.091
This is too much!

23:27.132 --> 23:28.968
I shall end it.
Where's my razor?

23:30.803 --> 23:32.930
- Razor.
- I don't think we sold it.

23:32.972 --> 23:34.223
Razor!

23:35.099 --> 23:36.141
Oh.

23:37.434 --> 23:39.436
Swift, final.

23:39.478 --> 23:43.649
- Let them have their blood.
- Never! Hold that.

23:43.691 --> 23:45.859
If you are to exit, then so shall I!

23:48.279 --> 23:52.408
If it would help, I have some money
from Mr Murdstone for my supper.

24:02.835 --> 24:05.045
Angels in his fingertips.

24:18.684 --> 24:20.895
- There you go.
- Ah!

24:20.936 --> 24:24.440
Mrs Micawber is renowned
for her way with a mutton chop.

24:27.276 --> 24:29.111
- Would you care for one?
- No, no.

24:29.153 --> 24:32.990
Those are your specific chops
and your particular taters.

24:33.032 --> 24:36.452
You'd be very welcome.
This is a royal banquet.

24:46.962 --> 24:49.089
Ooh, very nice.

24:51.050 --> 24:53.844
"They're your particular chops

24:53.886 --> 24:57.139
and your specific taters."

24:57.181 --> 24:58.349
"Taters."

24:59.308 --> 25:04.563
London is full of more wonders
and wickedness

25:04.605 --> 25:06.649
than all the cities of the earth.

25:06.690 --> 25:08.275
Cities.

25:08.317 --> 25:12.571
And it's ours, David,
to go wherever we choose.

25:13.989 --> 25:16.951
No, not down there.
Creditors make that road impassable.

25:16.992 --> 25:20.537
Two tailors
and a most unreasonable muffin man.

25:20.579 --> 25:22.248
More creditors.

25:22.831 --> 25:26.961
A knife grinder, a dairyman
and an unhinged florist.

25:27.544 --> 25:31.966
You find us fallen back financially
but something shall turn up.

25:32.007 --> 25:36.595
- But won't we run out of roads?
- I think we already have. Run!

25:36.637 --> 25:38.722
Come here!

25:38.764 --> 25:40.099
There's St Paul's.

25:48.482 --> 25:51.151
Forward! Right! Right! Right.

25:54.572 --> 25:57.616
He's a corker of a corker.

26:01.370 --> 26:02.788
Five a minute.

26:03.956 --> 26:08.127
Keep at it, Wilson, else I'll have to cork six
to make up for your four.

26:08.168 --> 26:10.588
Jump. Imagine you're an acrobat.

26:10.629 --> 26:12.631
Much better. Good. Faster.

26:18.345 --> 26:21.473
I hope your day
was more remarkable than mine.

26:21.515 --> 26:24.643
It certainly involved
a remarkable number of bottles.

26:24.685 --> 26:28.480
If Mr Micawber had but a shilling for each bottle
you corked in the warehouse today...

26:28.522 --> 26:33.611
I should still face a remarkably
disheartening pile of debt.

26:33.652 --> 26:37.156
I'm like the tomatoes
shrivelling in our yard.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.075
In short, blighted.

26:41.785 --> 26:44.997
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Bailiffs. Hide...

26:45.039 --> 26:46.457
Hide the spoons!

26:48.417 --> 26:49.960
- The child.
- It's the rug

26:50.002 --> 26:51.754
- The rug.
- I've got it.

26:51.795 --> 26:53.756
Get the child.

26:53.797 --> 26:57.176
- Me child!
- Hold the rug. Off it.

27:00.054 --> 27:02.932
- What's happening?
- Bailiffs. We are undone.

27:02.973 --> 27:05.893
The sun goes down upon us.
The debtors' prison awaits.

27:07.061 --> 27:09.897
The curtains.
He's taking the curtains.

27:09.939 --> 27:13.359
That is not your chicken.
You're stealing an honest man's chicken.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.903
At least let him finish his meal,
you malicious apes.

27:15.945 --> 27:19.114
Hands off Micawber.
He bruises like a peach.

27:19.156 --> 27:22.117
Oh, Martha!
The bailiffs are taking Martha.

27:22.159 --> 27:24.286
- Here. Come here.
- All right.

27:24.328 --> 27:25.788
I trust you're happy.

27:27.122 --> 27:29.041
That's all my stuff!

27:30.292 --> 27:31.335
St Paul's.

27:44.682 --> 27:46.809
Until something turns up.

28:12.918 --> 28:14.420
Copperfield!

28:26.223 --> 28:27.850
- Come in.
- Come in.

28:34.106 --> 28:36.525
- Your stepfather informs me...
- Me.

28:37.276 --> 28:40.029
- That your mama is ill.
- Ill.

28:40.070 --> 28:41.906
- How ill is she?
- Tell him.

28:41.947 --> 28:43.365
- Jane.
- Jane.

28:43.407 --> 28:46.452
- Tell me, please.
- I won't deceive you.

28:46.493 --> 28:48.704
- Very ill.
- Very ill.

28:48.746 --> 28:50.080
- Very ill?
- Very ill?

28:50.122 --> 28:51.415
Dangerously ill.

28:51.457 --> 28:52.666
She's dead.

28:58.088 --> 29:01.300
We're, uh... We're very sorry.

29:06.764 --> 29:08.474
And...? And her funeral?

29:08.515 --> 29:10.434
- On Saturday.
- Saturday.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.770
Saturday.

29:14.355 --> 29:16.815
Ought I to come back with you now
or take a later coach?

29:16.857 --> 29:20.569
No, it was the Saturday just gone.
She's buried.

29:23.447 --> 29:25.741
- We didn't want a fuss.
- Fuss.

29:38.837 --> 29:41.006
- Copperfield.
- Copperfield.

29:51.475 --> 29:54.687
Copperfield, I will allow you that.
You are upset.

29:54.728 --> 29:56.772
- But do not...
- Do not...

29:56.814 --> 30:01.151
- Right, that's it. Half a day's pay.
- Half of nothing is nothing.

30:01.193 --> 30:05.364
Given the manner of your overreaction,
it is a good thing you were not at the funeral.

30:05.406 --> 30:07.449
You can't take
from someone who has nothing!

30:07.491 --> 30:10.202
- Nothing!
- You think of your future, boy.

30:10.244 --> 30:12.871
Apart from your Aunt Betsey,
you are without relatives.

30:12.913 --> 30:15.958
I deserve more than this.
Far more!

30:23.424 --> 30:24.592
David!

30:30.389 --> 30:31.473
You two are ghosts.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.602
You've always been dead.

30:37.605 --> 30:38.689
Quiet!

30:38.731 --> 30:39.815
Quiet!

31:03.756 --> 31:06.800
Hey! That's my box! No!

31:06.842 --> 31:07.843
That's...!

31:08.928 --> 31:11.722
Hey! Hey! You scoundrel!

31:11.764 --> 31:12.848
Hey!

31:20.773 --> 31:23.692
Excuse me. Do you know
where Miss Trotwood lives?

31:23.734 --> 31:25.110
About a mile up that way.

31:25.694 --> 31:28.697
Good luck.
She's fierce like a birthing badger.

31:28.739 --> 31:29.782
Thank you.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.919
Janet! Donkeys!

31:41.961 --> 31:43.629
Donkeys!

31:43.671 --> 31:44.755
Go on!

31:44.797 --> 31:46.340
Go on! Go away!

31:48.342 --> 31:52.388
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Get off my lawn! I'll box your ears!

31:53.264 --> 31:56.058
Off you go!
This is a donkey-free zone!

31:56.100 --> 31:57.560
Move it!

31:57.601 --> 31:59.979
- Cheek of it.
- Somebody! Somebody, please!

32:00.020 --> 32:03.065
King Charles I.
Are we certain that he's dead?

32:03.107 --> 32:06.443
When last seen in public,
his head was not attached to his body.

32:07.027 --> 32:09.321
Good. Thank you. Much obliged.

32:09.363 --> 32:10.447
Boy there.

32:11.574 --> 32:15.327
No, no. Shoo. No young men needed here.
I've got a garden fork.

32:15.369 --> 32:17.913
- I'm not just a young man.
- I'll summon the constable.

32:23.335 --> 32:24.545
Listen!

32:25.879 --> 32:27.256
You're my aunt.

32:27.298 --> 32:29.049
- Janet!
- I'm your nephew.

32:30.259 --> 32:32.761
I'm David Copperfield.
From The Rookery.

32:32.803 --> 32:34.054
Mr Dick!

32:34.096 --> 32:38.225
I've been ill-used and put to work not fit for me.
And you're the only family I have.

32:39.226 --> 32:42.104
- Come inside. Come inside. Janet!
- Yes, ma'am?

32:42.146 --> 32:43.772
- Mr Dick.
- Shall I get water?

32:43.814 --> 32:45.649
And I've barely eaten.

32:45.691 --> 32:48.861
- I think there are donkeys out there.
- Mr Dick!

32:48.903 --> 32:50.946
Don't touch anything.
That's it. That's it.

32:50.988 --> 32:53.490
- I'm sorry.
- Can you put the thing on the thing?

32:53.532 --> 32:55.534
There we go.
Not the chair. It's Viennese.

32:55.576 --> 32:57.620
- Everything's circular.
- On the sofa.

32:59.204 --> 33:01.790
- He's actually going to the other chair.
- I'm gonna drop.

33:03.292 --> 33:04.585
He's gone.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.588
Hello? Can you wake up?

33:12.760 --> 33:15.137
- What are you doing?
- Medicine. Reviving you.

33:15.179 --> 33:17.473
- This is salad dressing.
- Is it?

33:17.514 --> 33:20.059
Thought it was Armagnac.
Don't have my spectacles on.

33:20.100 --> 33:23.020
Do you have a lettuce somewhere
covered in ointment?

33:23.771 --> 33:27.441
His head is entirely removed from his body?
We're sure?

33:27.483 --> 33:30.778
Let's leave Charles's head
on one side for the moment, Mr Dick.

33:31.528 --> 33:33.197
Pick it up later. Understood.

33:33.739 --> 33:36.158
- How do you do?
- Now, Mr Dick, don't be a fool,

33:36.200 --> 33:39.036
because nobody can be more discerning
than you when you choose.

33:39.578 --> 33:42.623
David Copperfield, my brother,
you've heard me speak of him?

33:43.415 --> 33:44.833
Yes, just then.

33:46.293 --> 33:48.337
Oh, you mean before that?

33:48.379 --> 33:51.757
Uh, yes, I'm sure I remember.
Ooh. I'm hungry.

33:51.799 --> 33:54.051
- Cakes. Those are cakes.
- Mr Dick.

33:54.093 --> 33:57.554
My brother, David Copperfield,
this is his son, who's run away.

33:57.596 --> 34:00.057
- What shall we do with him?
- One thing you could do is...

34:00.099 --> 34:03.519
- If I were you, I'd wash him.
- Janet!

34:03.561 --> 34:05.396
- Yes?
- Run the bath! There you are.

34:05.437 --> 34:08.190
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mr Dick cracks it every time.

34:08.232 --> 34:10.901
The thing is,
I haven't eaten in a very long time.

34:10.942 --> 34:13.279
- Donkeys! Janet!
- Yes, ma'am?

34:13.319 --> 34:15.447
There must be 50 of them.
It's an infestation.

34:15.489 --> 34:16.991
- Thank you.
- Janet!

34:20.286 --> 34:24.456
- Is my aunt really going to...?
- To visit violence upon the boy? Yes.

34:25.749 --> 34:27.209
She's a remarkable woman.

34:27.835 --> 34:28.960
Very kind.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.426
"Very kind."

34:35.467 --> 34:37.052
"Very kind." Hm.

34:38.470 --> 34:40.806
"Somebody. Somebody, please."

34:42.141 --> 34:43.225
"Somebody, please."

34:47.938 --> 34:49.772
"Head taken off?"

34:50.607 --> 34:52.026
"We're sure?"

34:52.067 --> 34:53.319
"Janet! Donkeys!"

35:06.206 --> 35:09.752
- Good morning, Mr Dick.
- Come in. Come in. Form a queue.

35:11.170 --> 35:15.132
The capital letter Q.
I'm trying different forms.

35:16.175 --> 35:17.551
I like this one.

35:18.135 --> 35:22.181
- A cigar in an ashtray. You see?
- Or a kite with a string.

35:23.223 --> 35:27.353
"The executioner's blade
is cold and sharp."

35:27.394 --> 35:28.395
I'm sorry?

35:29.188 --> 35:33.234
Your aunt gave me that kite to encourage me
out of the house from time to time

35:33.275 --> 35:35.903
while she drinks coffee and is quiet.

35:36.862 --> 35:38.280
I'm still in the house.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.160
I see you're writing stories
about Charles I.

35:43.911 --> 35:45.246
Why? What makes you say that?

35:47.331 --> 35:50.376
There seems to be
the occasional reference to him.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.628
- Everywhere.
- Yes.

35:53.504 --> 35:55.798
Yes, King Charles I does creep in.

35:56.882 --> 35:58.717
You see, I'm trying to draft a petition

35:59.760 --> 36:04.223
calling for improved housing conditions
for the labouring poor,

36:04.265 --> 36:05.724
and I work very hard at it

36:05.766 --> 36:08.686
but the thoughts
in King Charles's head,

36:09.436 --> 36:11.355
they keep intruding.

36:11.397 --> 36:13.857
Sorry. King Charles's head?

36:13.899 --> 36:14.900
Yes.

36:15.651 --> 36:18.529
Owing to a disagreement,
they cut it off.

36:18.571 --> 36:21.907
In 1649.
That's well documented.

36:21.949 --> 36:23.117
Is it?

36:24.285 --> 36:27.162
Well, for reasons
that I don't fully understand,

36:27.204 --> 36:30.791
they decided to remove
the troubling thoughts in his head

36:30.833 --> 36:32.334
and put them into mine.

36:32.376 --> 36:36.213
Very, very disruptive.
I have to write them down, you see.

36:36.255 --> 36:37.923
- Uh...
- You write them down?

36:37.965 --> 36:39.258
Yes, I...

36:40.884 --> 36:45.598
"I mount the scaffold wearing two shirts
so shivers aren't mistaken for fear."

36:48.517 --> 36:50.561
You must think this very peculiar.

36:50.603 --> 36:53.397
No. By no means.
Something similar happens to me.

36:54.607 --> 36:56.859
It does? With King Charles?

36:56.901 --> 37:01.947
No, but I find when I've been in the company
of some person of strong character,

37:01.989 --> 37:05.826
their voice becomes lodged
in my head.

37:05.868 --> 37:07.244
And...

37:11.749 --> 37:14.084
And I too write down
the thoughts I have.

37:14.126 --> 37:16.670
And the things I observe.
St Paul's on there.

37:18.339 --> 37:19.757
See.

37:21.216 --> 37:26.221
"Miss Murdstone's sleepless eyes,
like two red suns."

37:28.349 --> 37:31.477
"The bottles are propelled
by iron pistons

37:31.518 --> 37:35.856
that nod up and down
like melancholy mad elephants."

37:35.898 --> 37:39.818
- What do you think?
- I think that's very, very good.

37:39.860 --> 37:43.614
- And your calligraphy is excellent.
- Breakfast is ready!

37:43.656 --> 37:45.199
That'll be breakfast.

37:48.077 --> 37:50.871
Aunt, Mr Dick, is he at all...?

37:50.913 --> 37:53.749
- Did he mention Charles I?
- Quite a lot.

37:53.791 --> 37:56.502
He connects his, um, particular situation

37:56.543 --> 37:58.879
with great disturbance and agitation.

37:58.921 --> 38:01.882
But his mind's sharp as a surgeon's lancet,
make no mistake.

38:01.924 --> 38:05.344
- I think I may be able to help him.
- Well, on you go back up, Trotwood.

38:05.386 --> 38:08.722
- Janet can soft-boil an egg in a flash.
- Thank you.

38:11.976 --> 38:13.477
Um... Sorry.

38:14.395 --> 38:18.399
- Trotwood?
- Yes, I thought I might call you Trotwood.

38:18.440 --> 38:23.445
If I'm to financially support my nephew,
I want to like his name.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.074
- Trotwood, that's me, yes.
- Mm.

38:28.117 --> 38:29.285
Mr Dick?

38:30.953 --> 38:32.204
Mr Dick? Mr Dick?

38:34.206 --> 38:35.291
Is it lunch?

38:35.332 --> 38:37.793
No, the troubling thoughts
from King Charles's head,

38:37.835 --> 38:39.753
they weigh you down?

38:39.795 --> 38:42.923
Yes, I try and keep them in order
but they do pile up and oppress me.

38:43.507 --> 38:46.135
"As I die, I move
from corruptible crown to in..."

38:46.176 --> 38:49.263
No, Mr Dick, we can release them.

38:49.305 --> 38:51.348
We can cast them to the wind.

38:57.104 --> 39:01.525
- Can't say that I'm feeling much better.
- You have to fly it first. Come on.

39:02.985 --> 39:06.739
- Kite time!
- Lead on! Lead on!

39:06.780 --> 39:09.575
- Up, up, up, up! Fly!
- That's it, Mr Dick. Steady.

39:09.617 --> 39:12.328
- Steady.
- I can't believe it.

39:12.369 --> 39:14.371
The sky is absorbing my words.

39:15.205 --> 39:18.542
- The higher the words go...
- The clearer my mind becomes.

39:19.627 --> 39:21.962
Oh, I... I haven't felt like this...

39:23.130 --> 39:25.674
It's as if I'm reading
for the bar again.

39:26.592 --> 39:27.843
Before everything...

39:28.928 --> 39:32.222
I used to share a staircase
with Tommy Traddles.

39:32.806 --> 39:34.683
He was a terrific fellow.

39:34.725 --> 39:37.478
<i>Un camarade très formidable,</i>
as the French say.

39:38.604 --> 39:40.231
Well, now, there's a thing.

39:40.272 --> 39:43.651
I'd completely forgotten that I can...
I can speak French.

39:44.568 --> 39:48.530
- This is a remarkable day.
- It's a delight to see you so liberated.

39:49.573 --> 39:52.326
- Isn't that magnificent?
- Beautiful.

39:53.369 --> 39:56.205
With one hand, sir.
With one hand, I tell you.

39:57.081 --> 39:59.083
This boy is terrific.

39:59.959 --> 40:02.002
Thank you, um...

40:02.044 --> 40:04.630
Trotwood. David's son.

40:05.339 --> 40:08.759
- Thank you, Trotwood Davidson.
- Pleasure, sir.

40:14.014 --> 40:16.934
Donkeys! Shoo! Shoo! Come on!

40:16.976 --> 40:19.687
On your way. I'll tan your hide
and put you in a stew!

40:19.728 --> 40:21.438
I'm a huge maniac!

40:22.523 --> 40:24.149
That's it. Shoo.

40:24.775 --> 40:27.987
- Very ferocious shooing.
- Hello.

40:29.238 --> 40:31.949
We suffer from a plague of donkeys.

40:32.533 --> 40:35.452
You must be Trotwood.
I'm Wickfield.

40:35.494 --> 40:39.123
- I act for your aunt in matters of finance.
- Right.

40:39.164 --> 40:41.792
- This is my daughter, Agnes.
- Oh.

40:42.918 --> 40:45.212
A bow. I'm so rarely bowed to.

40:46.046 --> 40:49.300
I hope I've started a new fashion.
Unless you deem it inappropriate.

40:49.341 --> 40:52.928
No, not at all, Trotwood. I shall demand it
at our every meeting from now on,

40:52.970 --> 40:54.638
as if I'm an empress.

40:55.264 --> 40:56.682
Or mad.

40:56.724 --> 40:59.727
Ah, Mr Wickfield.
Agnes, how very nice to see you.

40:59.768 --> 41:01.937
- Are you well?
- That was quite the journey.

41:01.979 --> 41:04.231
- Was it?
- Is it too early for sherry?

41:04.273 --> 41:05.691
A little early.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.778
Port, then.
It's seven in the evening in Singapore.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.656
- I imagine.
- Father, it's too early to drink.

41:12.698 --> 41:15.618
Trotwood,
Mr Wickfield owns the freehold

41:15.659 --> 41:19.955
of a very fine educational
establishment in Canterbury.

41:19.997 --> 41:24.168
It's snapping at the heels
of the better-known establishments.

41:25.419 --> 41:28.505
I have a thirst for education
that sadly has never been quenched.

41:28.547 --> 41:32.259
Really? You give the impression
of a very well-watered intellect.

41:32.301 --> 41:34.678
All this talk of thirst
is making me thirsty.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.182
- How is business, Mr Wickfield?
- All is well.

41:38.223 --> 41:43.479
Uh, there are, of course, challenges.
Uh, the reduced tariffs.

41:43.520 --> 41:48.359
The retreat of mercantilism.
If I could show you on the globe...

41:53.656 --> 41:58.452
Here in Europe and... the Americas.

41:58.494 --> 42:00.162
I could go on.

42:00.204 --> 42:02.957
- India.
- "All is well" would have sufficed.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.583
Somebody. Somebody.

42:05.876 --> 42:08.796
No, no, no, Mr Dick.
Mr Dick, come. Come be with us.

42:08.837 --> 42:12.299
Hello. I'm Mr Dick.
I'm very partial to gingerbread.

42:12.341 --> 42:15.928
As am I, Mr Dick.
I adore the fiery taste.

42:16.762 --> 42:18.889
Delighted to meet you.

42:18.931 --> 42:20.557
Delighted. Thank you.

42:21.642 --> 42:23.352
Can you just confirm something?

42:23.394 --> 42:25.521
- My head...
- Yes?

42:25.563 --> 42:27.147
Am I right?

42:27.189 --> 42:31.151
- My head is connected to my body?
- Well, let me have a look. Yes.

42:31.193 --> 42:35.406
- I can confirm without any doubt that it is.
- Well, that's good to hear.

42:36.282 --> 42:39.743
- Would you like to see my kite?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

42:39.785 --> 42:41.036
Come on, Davidson.

42:45.749 --> 42:46.834
Where's that?

42:47.459 --> 42:49.878
- Mr Dick?
- Uh, no.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.674
Agony. It's about the king's agony.
That's going up there.

42:54.592 --> 42:57.177
He believes
when Charles I was executed,

42:57.219 --> 42:59.722
the king's troubles flew from his head
to nest in Mr Dick's own.

43:00.556 --> 43:02.600
Is that why you fly them
on your kite, Mr Dick?

43:02.641 --> 43:05.269
- Precisely.
- It's the obvious course of action.

43:05.311 --> 43:07.187
Oh, I like you.

43:07.229 --> 43:10.399
What a happy coincidence,
because I like you too.

43:11.108 --> 43:13.736
Davidson's idea.
The boy's a marvel.

43:16.572 --> 43:19.199
Mr Dick, you look like
you're playing the kettledrums.

43:19.241 --> 43:21.452
He does.
You should write that down.

43:21.493 --> 43:24.955
I will arrange for Trotwood
to board with Mrs Strong.

43:24.997 --> 43:27.625
- This calls for a celebration.
- Yes.

43:28.334 --> 43:29.960
- Hooray!
- Hooray.

43:30.586 --> 43:34.632
I was thinking
more along the lines of a...

43:34.673 --> 43:36.926
- Tea? Janet!
- Yes.

43:36.967 --> 43:38.052
- Tea.
- Tea.

43:38.093 --> 43:39.386
- Tea. Tea.
- Tea. Tea.

43:39.428 --> 43:41.388
- Tea's fine.
- Kite time!

43:43.641 --> 43:47.311
Oh, Mr Wickfield, why don't you have
a big glass of port wine?

43:47.353 --> 43:49.563
- You do love it so.
- I do, Mr Dick.

43:50.522 --> 43:52.358
I'm touched you remembered.

43:52.399 --> 43:54.818
- It's working, Agnes!
- My gosh.

43:54.860 --> 43:58.405
- I wouldn't call myself an expert, but...
- Do you do this every day?

44:00.991 --> 44:03.369
- Look.
- Look how happy he is.

44:14.046 --> 44:15.506
Kite time!

44:18.008 --> 44:21.262
<i>I'm going to miss our picnics
when you go away to board.</i>

44:21.303 --> 44:23.222
You'll enjoy Mrs Strong's establishment.

44:23.264 --> 44:25.766
It's not in a perfect condition
but it means well.

44:25.808 --> 44:27.184
A little like my father.

44:28.227 --> 44:30.104
Oh, now.

44:42.157 --> 44:43.492
Thank you.

44:48.163 --> 44:49.873
- That's all right.
- No.

44:49.915 --> 44:53.168
It's not even a bit of trouble to help.
It's pure Christian pleasure.

44:53.210 --> 44:55.462
- I'm Uri...
- Would you open the door?

44:55.504 --> 44:57.506
Mr Wickfield, steady on.

44:57.548 --> 45:00.843
These steps are lethal.
Very, very high.

45:00.884 --> 45:03.846
- Uriah, there's no need.
- I can't. Shall I get back in?

45:03.887 --> 45:06.682
You're getting close.
Come on. One step.

45:06.724 --> 45:08.767
- Slowly. There you go.
- Mr Wickfield.

45:08.809 --> 45:11.145
Mrs Strong. Welcome.

45:11.186 --> 45:14.148
No, you're welcome.
I'm already here.

45:14.189 --> 45:16.317
- My head's muddled.
- From the bumpy journey.

45:16.358 --> 45:20.195
- This is Cropwood Trotterfield.
- Trotwood Copperfield.

45:20.237 --> 45:22.948
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs Strong.
- Pleasure is all mine.

45:22.990 --> 45:25.117
- What do you have in your hand?
- It's nothing.

45:25.159 --> 45:28.787
Oh, just a small piece of wall.
But all is well. Follow me.

45:29.413 --> 45:31.457
We live just over there.
Come and visit.

45:31.498 --> 45:32.499
I will.

45:33.584 --> 45:36.587
- I'm Uriah Heep...
- Oh, here we are!

45:36.629 --> 45:40.549
Oh, dear. That's disappointing.
Uriah, drip.

45:40.591 --> 45:44.845
- Shall I do the bucket?
- Thank you. Follow me.

45:45.638 --> 45:49.934
Like all the great old establishments,
we have our little traditions.

45:52.770 --> 45:54.271
Good morning!

45:56.440 --> 45:59.652
Oh, well,
I think we'll let Mr Steerforth

45:59.693 --> 46:03.614
just finish his funny little story
about the geography teacher.

46:04.281 --> 46:06.742
Wearing the shortest of his three wigs.

46:09.245 --> 46:10.246
Oh.

46:11.205 --> 46:13.040
This is Copperfield. He's new.

46:13.082 --> 46:16.168
I surmised as much, Mrs Strong,
but I appreciate the confirmation.

46:16.210 --> 46:20.297
Oh.
Oh, very good, Mr Steerforth.

46:20.339 --> 46:23.425
I'm thrilled to make your acquaintance,
Master Copperfield.

46:23.467 --> 46:26.387
- Thank you.
- Uriah, bring that to the dormitory.

46:26.428 --> 46:28.514
I'm in deep humility.

46:34.186 --> 46:38.649
And with that,
Uriah Heep rubbed himself out of the room.

46:40.484 --> 46:43.070
Steerforth. James Steerforth.

46:43.112 --> 46:44.738
Davidson. No, David Co...

46:44.780 --> 46:47.283
No, sorry.
Trotwood Copperfield.

46:47.908 --> 46:49.577
Is all that hyphenated?

46:51.245 --> 46:54.957
- You see, my aunt calls me...
- What do you make of our friend Heep?

46:57.626 --> 46:59.878
- He's perplexing.
- Perplexing.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.715
- Perplexing how?
- Difficult to describe?

47:03.966 --> 47:07.177
He twitches his mouth
like a curious lizard.

47:08.637 --> 47:11.265
Yes, he does.
Tell me another one.

47:11.307 --> 47:14.977
He stands so close by
that he's nearer to you than your own shirt.

47:15.019 --> 47:18.022
Yes. You are as sharp as a whip.

47:18.063 --> 47:22.276
I like you. Come, sit.
Markham, move these boys, will you? Quickly.

47:22.318 --> 47:24.236
- Round. Move round.
- Come, sit.

47:24.278 --> 47:26.822
- Round. You sit there.
- Sorry.

47:26.864 --> 47:27.865
Heads!

47:29.742 --> 47:33.412
Forgive the collapsing.
Old Wickfield's funds are drying up.

47:33.454 --> 47:35.497
Unlike the man himself.

47:35.539 --> 47:37.958
Loves his drink.
Do you know Wickfield?

47:38.959 --> 47:41.462
"Is it too early for sherry?"

47:44.423 --> 47:46.884
Look, here he is trying to thread a needle.

47:50.346 --> 47:53.515
Well, welcome. Yes?

47:53.557 --> 47:55.267
Welcome.

48:07.112 --> 48:08.697
I'm glad you've arrived.

48:10.157 --> 48:11.742
Nice cut on that waistcoat.

48:14.912 --> 48:17.623
- Who's your tailor?
- Just a man.

48:18.457 --> 48:20.376
From Dover.
My aunt took me to...

48:20.417 --> 48:22.419
Your aunt brought you up?

48:22.461 --> 48:26.048
Well, she certainly brought me up sharp
a few times, I can tell you.

48:27.883 --> 48:31.762
The very daisy in the field
is not fresher than you are.

48:35.349 --> 48:37.142
I shall call you Daisy.

48:37.184 --> 48:40.187
- Will you mind?
- Not at all.

48:40.229 --> 48:42.898
Why on earth would you, Daisy?

48:44.817 --> 48:49.154
I have some currant wine here
and almond cakes, if you'd like?

48:49.196 --> 48:51.198
Yes, I'd like that very much.
Thank you.

48:51.240 --> 48:54.660
You haven't got a sister...

48:56.328 --> 48:57.329
...have you, Daisy?

48:58.831 --> 48:59.999
No.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.250
Pity.

49:08.716 --> 49:09.717
Daisy.

49:11.844 --> 49:14.013
- Yes?
- Read to me.

49:16.140 --> 49:17.224
I can't sleep.

49:17.266 --> 49:18.726
Read?

49:20.895 --> 49:25.024
This book's quite long.
Why don't I tell you a story of mine?

49:25.065 --> 49:29.111
Perhaps... one about
a kindly nurse and her charge

49:29.153 --> 49:31.530
who slept in an upturned boat
in Yarmouth.

49:31.572 --> 49:34.742
No. I don't care for whimsy. Sorry.

49:35.951 --> 49:36.952
Right.

49:38.287 --> 49:40.581
Do you have a scary story?

49:42.041 --> 49:46.754
- Oh, I have one about an evil factory owner.
- Yes.

49:46.795 --> 49:51.050
<i>His name is</i> Murderstone
<i>and he delights in terrifying children.</i>

49:51.091 --> 49:52.343
Enough!

49:52.384 --> 49:55.930
- The monster.
- He has an equally cruel sister.

49:55.971 --> 49:57.848
So, he's got a sister.

49:57.890 --> 50:00.059
She's a cold and metallic lady.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.436
- I'll smash it.
- Then I shall smash you.

50:02.478 --> 50:04.563
Jane! Jane!

50:04.605 --> 50:07.066
- Be quiet.
- No!

50:08.901 --> 50:12.238
- Is there vengeance on the pair?
- Wait for it.

50:17.326 --> 50:18.744
Listen to me.

50:26.085 --> 50:29.755
And you made these tales
of the factory boy up out of thin air?

50:29.797 --> 50:33.384
- All invented, yes.
- Daisy, you truly are the Eighth Wonder.

50:33.425 --> 50:34.677
Thank you.

50:34.718 --> 50:36.262
You should publish.

50:36.303 --> 50:39.014
You seem to have a lot of knowledge
about the detail in the factory.

50:39.056 --> 50:41.308
Was your father in manufacturing?

50:41.350 --> 50:44.395
- My stepfather.
- Stepfather?

50:44.436 --> 50:47.523
So you had a stepfather,
but you were raised by an aunt?

50:47.565 --> 50:49.400
Look. Who's that, Steerforth?

50:49.441 --> 50:52.361
Ah, yes.
That's the eldest, Miss Larkins.

50:52.403 --> 50:53.821
Pretty, isn't she?

50:54.822 --> 50:58.701
- She's a blaze of beauty.
- She's engaged to an army captain.

50:58.742 --> 51:01.036
Only because she's yet to meet me.

51:01.078 --> 51:02.454
Look out.

51:02.496 --> 51:05.457
A couple of Miss Strong's prize poodles
have got loose.

51:07.042 --> 51:08.794
- Very amusing.
- Ignore him.

51:08.836 --> 51:12.965
Oi! Ladies! I'll beat you
with one hand tied behind me.

51:14.592 --> 51:17.469
- You wanna fight, do you?
- Yeah.

51:17.511 --> 51:19.346
Then, sir...

51:20.973 --> 51:22.016
...name your time!

51:22.057 --> 51:23.309
Fight!

51:24.018 --> 51:27.396
- You can box, I take it, Daisy?
- After a fashion, certainly.

51:27.438 --> 51:30.357
All right, gentlemen.
No eyeball-gouging. No...

51:30.399 --> 51:33.861
Actually, everything else is allowed.
Get set, fight!

51:41.076 --> 51:42.912
Get up! Get up now!

51:42.953 --> 51:46.081
Daisy, you need a hook,
feint, upper cut.

51:46.123 --> 51:47.416
- What?
- Upper cut.

51:49.126 --> 51:50.920
It's done. It's done.

51:52.463 --> 51:54.173
Daisy.

51:54.214 --> 51:57.426
You did, in some ways,
do very well, Daisy.

51:58.010 --> 52:01.430
Let's get you back to Wickfield's house.
Come on. Up.

52:02.932 --> 52:04.475
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:08.354 --> 52:09.396
Come on.

52:10.231 --> 52:14.652
Well, try not to die
or anything boring like that, Daisy.

52:14.693 --> 52:16.028
I'll try my best.

52:19.156 --> 52:21.200
What a confident gentleman he is.

52:23.118 --> 52:25.704
Mother taught me the medical rudiments.

52:26.705 --> 52:30.209
She's the laundress here.
Washes your bed sheets.

52:30.251 --> 52:32.795
Always very clean. Relatively.

52:32.836 --> 52:34.588
Oh, she will burst with gratitude

52:34.630 --> 52:38.300
that you have acknowledged her
spontaneously, Master Copperfield.

52:40.594 --> 52:43.305
Miss Wickfield is very...

52:43.347 --> 52:45.933
- Do you not think?
- Very what?

52:45.975 --> 52:48.769
My dear Trotwood,
they told me you were here.

52:49.395 --> 52:52.940
Oh dear, look at you. I imagine
the other fellow must be dreadfully injured.

52:52.982 --> 52:55.859
Oh, yes. Close to death.

52:55.901 --> 52:57.861
Measured for his coffin.

52:57.903 --> 53:01.365
- How were Uriah's ministrations?
- He's like a human cold in the head.

53:01.949 --> 53:03.701
- He gets so close.
- Yes.

53:03.742 --> 53:06.912
It's as if he lives in your nose
and is keen to get home.

53:06.954 --> 53:08.872
- Did he mention his mother?
- His mother?

53:08.914 --> 53:11.375
Oh, Agnes,
I burst with gratitude

53:11.417 --> 53:13.669
that you should ask me
such a question spontaneously.

53:14.378 --> 53:18.048
So, is this Steerforth's doing,
getting you into fights?

53:18.090 --> 53:20.884
No. In fact, he tried to stop me.

53:20.926 --> 53:24.305
Doesn't think a gentleman should be seen
fighting with a butcher's boy.

53:24.346 --> 53:26.265
- Gentleman?
- Yes.

53:26.849 --> 53:29.268
Steerforth thinks of me
as a gentleman.

53:29.310 --> 53:30.895
You are.

53:32.521 --> 53:35.900
- I assume you haven't told him about your past.
- No. I fear he might...

53:37.359 --> 53:41.447
It's the first time someone like that
has regarded me as an equal.

53:42.197 --> 53:43.657
Except you, Agnes.

53:43.699 --> 53:45.826
- And I think of you as a sister.
- Special?

53:47.912 --> 53:49.371
A special sister.

53:50.039 --> 53:52.625
Might I be so bold, Master Copperfield,

53:53.792 --> 53:56.295
as to ask you to come to tea?

53:56.337 --> 53:57.504
With me and Mother.

53:58.839 --> 54:03.052
What a shame. I fear I have
a prior engagement on that date.

54:03.093 --> 54:06.555
On which date?
I don't believe I mentioned a date.

54:06.597 --> 54:08.849
- I don't believe you did.
- I understand.

54:08.891 --> 54:10.768
Master Copperfield, I understand.

54:10.809 --> 54:14.104
It's not my place
to invite the likes of you to tea.

54:15.439 --> 54:19.944
No, I'd be...
I'd be glad to come, Mr Heep.

54:19.985 --> 54:21.195
Uriah, please.

54:21.237 --> 54:25.366
Oh, Mother will go off like a rocket.
Like a rocket.

54:25.407 --> 54:28.619
On the 14th, perhaps, at four?
And if Miss Wickfield would care to...?

54:28.661 --> 54:32.581
Sadly on the 14th at four
I have a prior engagement.

54:32.623 --> 54:36.627
Of course. I'm meant to join you
in that engagement, am I not, Agnes?

54:36.669 --> 54:38.087
I don't believe so, no.

54:40.047 --> 54:43.550
Good. Then I can definitely come to tea.

54:43.592 --> 54:47.596
Oh, I am so proud
to be noticed by you.

54:48.555 --> 54:51.934
- Are you done with that?
- Yes, of course. Help yourself.

54:51.976 --> 54:54.061
That's a tolerably nice bit of rump.

54:54.645 --> 54:56.438
No offence meant, I'm sure.

55:00.901 --> 55:02.987
300 hurrahs!

55:03.028 --> 55:05.447
And a dozen imperial whoo-hoos!

55:05.489 --> 55:07.199
The higher the kite goes,

55:07.241 --> 55:10.202
all those ridiculous thoughts
from King Charles's head

55:10.244 --> 55:12.329
seem to just dissolve away.

55:12.913 --> 55:15.958
I like that one, but tell me more
about the impecunious debtor

55:16.000 --> 55:18.210
with his dreadful concertina.

55:18.252 --> 55:22.047
- "There's something on the way."
- "Something will turn up."

55:22.089 --> 55:26.093
- Yes, that's it.
- An excellent precept, young man.

55:26.135 --> 55:30.180
Oh! We have a new master
in our midst.

55:30.222 --> 55:32.349
Professor Micawber.

55:33.851 --> 55:35.644
Good morning, boys.

55:36.312 --> 55:37.855
Please, be seated.

55:37.897 --> 55:40.274
Oh, dear Lord,
this place must be short of money.

55:40.316 --> 55:44.612
You lived with the professor when you were
in London, I do believe, Mr Copperfield.

55:44.653 --> 55:49.617
Professor? Yes, briefly,
and at the same time lengthily.

55:49.658 --> 55:51.827
Very nice. Very genteel.

55:52.953 --> 55:54.163
Uriah.

55:56.916 --> 55:59.209
- Good morning, boys.
- Sir.

56:00.127 --> 56:01.629
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

56:01.670 --> 56:03.047
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

56:07.843 --> 56:12.264
Now, which dish
from the great feast of knowledge

56:12.306 --> 56:16.644
is it our mutual privilege to partake of
at this current juncture?

56:18.646 --> 56:21.565
In short, which lesson is it now?

56:21.607 --> 56:23.442
It's Latin grammar now, sir.

56:25.361 --> 56:26.403
Latin?

56:27.196 --> 56:28.572
Good.

56:28.614 --> 56:30.199
Good. Um...

56:31.033 --> 56:33.661
<i>Amo, amas, amat.</i>

56:33.702 --> 56:35.996
Yes. <i>Amo, amas, amat.</i>

56:36.830 --> 56:38.207
Gymnasium.

56:38.958 --> 56:40.251
Geranium.

56:40.960 --> 56:42.378
Coliseum.

56:43.212 --> 56:45.381
Australasian.

56:45.422 --> 56:46.507
Australasian.

56:46.548 --> 56:47.800
Possum.

56:47.841 --> 56:53.931
No. A possum is a beast
of an Australasian, uh, distraction.

56:55.349 --> 56:57.393
Sniggering, gentlemen?

56:58.561 --> 57:01.939
Hilarity? In short, ha-ha?

57:02.690 --> 57:04.275
I don't think so.

57:05.526 --> 57:09.488
What you all need
is an aid to concentration.

57:12.992 --> 57:16.412
There is a belief
that music may help

57:16.996 --> 57:20.583
in the absorption of knowledge.

57:25.504 --> 57:28.007
- It's him.
- Don't say anything.

57:40.311 --> 57:42.563
Enough! Enough!

57:42.605 --> 57:45.691
I'm tempted to burst my eardrums
with a pair of pencils.

57:45.733 --> 57:47.234
I beg your pardon, sir?

57:47.276 --> 57:52.406
Steerforth meant that possibly the instrument
might have developed a leak or something.

57:52.448 --> 57:54.450
No, not at all.

57:54.491 --> 57:56.994
I meant that he is a dismal musician.

57:57.036 --> 58:01.332
Be quiet, please, Mr <i>Steelforge.</i>
Who are you to insult a gentleman?

58:02.207 --> 58:04.460
And where is he, this gentleman?

58:05.044 --> 58:07.796
- All I see is an impudent beggar.
- You...

58:08.631 --> 58:11.884
I heard all manner
of mad wheezing, Professor.

58:11.926 --> 58:14.094
Is there a squirrel
trapped in the pipes again?

58:14.136 --> 58:16.931
He is no professor.
Ask him about debtors' prison.

58:17.890 --> 58:19.808
He has extorted money for years

58:19.850 --> 58:22.519
and has followed Daisy here
to continue his efforts.

58:23.771 --> 58:24.772
Uh...

58:26.023 --> 58:27.524
Mr <i>Steepgorge</i> is correct.

58:28.567 --> 58:33.739
I did, to my shame,
reside within prison walls...

58:33.781 --> 58:37.159
Even we draw the line
at employing former convicts.

58:37.201 --> 58:40.746
And even often above that line
is where we draw the line, actually.

58:42.373 --> 58:45.459
We must part if you please.
Mr Heep, show him out.

58:47.378 --> 58:49.088
Steerforth!

58:51.173 --> 58:52.549
Micawber is harmless.

58:52.591 --> 58:55.094
The rogue was exploiting
your charitable good nature.

58:55.135 --> 58:58.514
- You should be thanking me, Daisy.
- My name is David! Not Daisy, not Trot!

58:58.555 --> 59:01.350
- My name is David Copperfield!
- Then why don't you go by it?

59:02.685 --> 59:04.019
Big step.

59:04.061 --> 59:06.564
- Up you go.
- Mr Micawber!

59:06.605 --> 59:08.065
In you go.

59:08.691 --> 59:10.985
- Mr Micawber.
- Master Copperfield.

59:11.026 --> 59:14.697
No sooner are we reunited
than we must part again.

59:14.738 --> 59:19.577
Like the Bible story. I'm sure
there must be a Bible story about that.

59:19.618 --> 59:20.619
Yes.

59:21.537 --> 59:25.040
Were you aware I studied
at Mrs Strong's before you came here?

59:25.082 --> 59:26.417
Not as I recall, no.

59:26.458 --> 59:29.920
But your being here as a professor,
in the same building as me...?

59:29.962 --> 59:34.842
Pure kismet and happenstance.
"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods."

59:34.883 --> 59:37.595
- To quote our ultimate poet.
- Shakespeare.

59:37.636 --> 59:40.306
All aboard. Who's going aboard?

59:40.347 --> 59:42.182
I wonder, um...

59:42.933 --> 59:45.603
I found the funds
for my family's travel,

59:45.644 --> 59:49.523
but my own fare is lacking.

59:49.565 --> 59:52.401
- I wonder if I could trouble you...
- No trouble.

59:52.443 --> 59:54.153
- ...for the exact sum...
- Of course.

59:54.194 --> 59:56.405
...of four pounds,
ten and thruppence?

1:00:04.830 --> 1:00:05.956
Five pounds.

1:00:05.998 --> 1:00:11.378
I will, uh, make sure
that we are quadrilaterally concluded.

1:00:11.420 --> 1:00:13.422
In short, square.

1:00:14.465 --> 1:00:15.466
Geometry.

1:00:16.675 --> 1:00:18.010
Safe travels.

1:00:19.929 --> 1:00:21.597
I imagine you've forgotten.

1:00:22.806 --> 1:00:25.726
- What?
- I imagine you've forgotten.

1:00:26.477 --> 1:00:27.478
Tea!

1:00:29.146 --> 1:00:30.940
There you go.

1:00:30.981 --> 1:00:33.150
Cake? It's quite heavy.

1:00:34.235 --> 1:00:35.778
I like a heavy cake.

1:00:37.196 --> 1:00:40.032
I like to... to know I've had a cake.

1:00:40.074 --> 1:00:42.701
- He can't abide a light sponge.
- I see.

1:00:43.827 --> 1:00:45.579
Well, this looks very, uh...

1:00:51.961 --> 1:00:54.797
Mm. Good Lord. That's, um...

1:00:56.006 --> 1:00:57.967
It's wonderfully dense. Hm.

1:01:00.636 --> 1:01:03.430
Oh, I see you're studying, Mr Heep.

1:01:03.472 --> 1:01:05.391
Uriah, if you can bear to.

1:01:06.225 --> 1:01:09.562
Yes. I'm trying to improve
my legal knowledge.

1:01:11.272 --> 1:01:15.985
I'm hopeful that Mr Wickfield might be willing
to take me on as an apprentice at law.

1:01:16.026 --> 1:01:17.736
Perhaps you'll become a partner.

1:01:18.988 --> 1:01:20.406
Do you mock me?

1:01:21.323 --> 1:01:25.953
You seem to search for mockery.
That was meant sincerely, Uriah.

1:01:25.995 --> 1:01:29.290
Uriah! Did you hear that?
He said Uriah.

1:01:29.331 --> 1:01:31.500
- I did.
- Unprompted, Mother.

1:01:31.542 --> 1:01:32.918
And him a gentleman.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:35.588
It is like the blowing of old breezes
to hear you say Uriah.

1:01:35.629 --> 1:01:37.923
It thrills me to the stomach.

1:01:39.967 --> 1:01:43.804
Time is an issue? Are you worried
humbleness is an infectious disease?

1:01:43.846 --> 1:01:45.973
Oh, no.
I cannot stay too long is all.

1:01:46.015 --> 1:01:50.227
- You can if I bar the door.
- We could keep him as a little pet.

1:01:51.770 --> 1:01:53.147
I beg your pardon?

1:01:53.188 --> 1:01:55.399
It was a joke.
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

1:01:55.983 --> 1:01:59.862
I've been attempting to learn
gentlemen's humour from a book.

1:01:59.904 --> 1:02:01.822
- He has.
- Indeed.

1:02:01.864 --> 1:02:04.617
What do you think of Mr Wickfield?

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.704
He takes his wine with an enviable degree
of enjoyment, don't he?

1:02:09.663 --> 1:02:11.916
- I've seen him take wine, but...
- You've seen him?

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:14.084
That's good to know.

1:02:19.256 --> 1:02:23.385
Your associate, the, uh... the professor.

1:02:23.427 --> 1:02:24.845
He's a sort, isn't he?

1:02:24.887 --> 1:02:28.641
Lodging with a beggar.
Is that a London particular?

1:02:28.682 --> 1:02:31.477
Mr Micawber isn't a beggar.
He's a man of fluctuating...

1:02:31.518 --> 1:02:32.519
More tea.

1:02:35.147 --> 1:02:37.650
I had an interesting little conversation
with Micawber

1:02:37.691 --> 1:02:39.318
as I was showing him out the school.

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:41.237
Yeah, fascinating.

1:02:41.278 --> 1:02:42.738
Your time in London.

1:02:43.822 --> 1:02:45.991
- Oh, Mother?
- Yes?

1:02:46.033 --> 1:02:48.160
Bring another bottle of milk.

1:02:48.202 --> 1:02:52.122
This bottle is empty
and another bottle is needed.

1:02:52.164 --> 1:02:54.583
You seem very vexed by this bottle.

1:02:57.670 --> 1:03:03.092
Your friend Steerforth is, um...
is damning of the humbler classes.

1:03:05.010 --> 1:03:09.348
A veritable factory of damnation.

1:03:10.266 --> 1:03:14.353
How would you feel about helping me
secure a position with Mr Wickfield?

1:03:16.355 --> 1:03:20.234
I have a mind
to throw this cake at you.

1:03:21.068 --> 1:03:22.903
It will break a rib.

1:03:22.945 --> 1:03:25.781
You're very fond of violence,
aren't you?

1:03:25.823 --> 1:03:29.159
Oh, look at you two.

1:03:29.201 --> 1:03:31.161
- More heavy cake.
- Cake.

1:03:31.203 --> 1:03:33.539
You must take some home with you.

1:03:47.261 --> 1:03:51.056
- I should like to go home.
- Just another two hours.

1:03:51.098 --> 1:03:53.601
- The donkeys will be back.
- 45 minutes, then.

1:03:53.642 --> 1:03:57.271
Oh, Mr Wickfield!
It is very, very uneven ground.

1:03:57.313 --> 1:03:59.481
I nearly slipped over myself
just a minute ago.

1:03:59.523 --> 1:04:03.611
- Very dangerous indeed. We need a sign here.
- It is dangerous. We need a sign.

1:04:03.652 --> 1:04:04.987
- More wine?
- No, not for me.

1:04:05.029 --> 1:04:07.990
No, not for him.
Thank you very much.

1:04:08.032 --> 1:04:14.246
I see. So, do you want me to take it away,
the delicious, tannic, deep-red wine?

1:04:14.288 --> 1:04:15.623
Yes, please.

1:04:17.541 --> 1:04:21.587
Actually, maybe the smallest amount.
Thank you. An ounce.

1:04:22.588 --> 1:04:24.048
Mrs Steerforth.

1:04:30.012 --> 1:04:31.847
<i>"Oi. Ladies."</i>

1:04:31.889 --> 1:04:34.892
"I could beat you with one hand
tied behind my back."

1:04:36.185 --> 1:04:37.269
Getting better.

1:04:39.313 --> 1:04:42.316
- James?
- Ah, Mother.

1:04:42.358 --> 1:04:44.026
This is, um...

1:04:44.068 --> 1:04:46.946
David Copperfield.
A very great pleasure to meet you, Mrs...

1:04:46.987 --> 1:04:49.740
What's your background, Mr Copperfield?
Who are your people?

1:04:50.491 --> 1:04:53.202
- My people?
- Your family. Are you anyone?

1:04:54.119 --> 1:04:56.872
- My parents died when I was...
- Prep school?

1:04:56.914 --> 1:05:00.376
- Yes. In London.
- I probably know it. Which one?

1:05:01.543 --> 1:05:02.544
Creakle's.

1:05:03.754 --> 1:05:08.550
Creakle's. Is that a saint? I don't think so.
Who was the headmaster?

1:05:09.843 --> 1:05:12.096
- Mr Murdstone.
- What was the uniform?

1:05:12.846 --> 1:05:13.847
Uh...

1:05:15.224 --> 1:05:17.351
Trousers, certainly, and...

1:05:17.393 --> 1:05:18.310
Anyway...

1:05:18.352 --> 1:05:22.648
James, I'm here,
since you bleated and bleated.

1:05:22.690 --> 1:05:26.068
I'll see you at Mrs Strong's interminable speech.
I brought a book.

1:05:26.652 --> 1:05:28.195
And a pillow.

1:05:30.656 --> 1:05:32.783
My mother.

1:05:32.825 --> 1:05:34.827
- Good Lord.
- Yeah.

1:05:34.868 --> 1:05:36.912
- Did you notice her scar?
- Yes.

1:05:36.954 --> 1:05:39.790
As a young boy
she once exasperated me

1:05:39.832 --> 1:05:41.333
so I threw a hammer at her.

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:46.338
Oh.

1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:48.591
Oh, good luck and God bless.

1:05:49.425 --> 1:05:52.011
You were always my favourite
and the most handsome.

1:05:53.095 --> 1:05:54.722
- Here's a book.
- Thank you.

1:05:56.890 --> 1:05:59.518
No breeze, not a breath.

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:02.062
The air is as still as a royal corpse.

1:06:02.104 --> 1:06:03.606
- How do you do?
- Trotwood.

1:06:03.647 --> 1:06:06.108
Uh, let me introduce Mr Spenlow.

1:06:06.150 --> 1:06:07.943
- Your future employer.
- What am I to be?

1:06:09.445 --> 1:06:10.946
You know this, Trot.

1:06:12.031 --> 1:06:14.241
- A proctor.
- Yes, sorry.

1:06:14.283 --> 1:06:15.951
- Good afternoon.
- Mr Spenlow.

1:06:15.993 --> 1:06:17.202
Mr Spenlow.

1:06:20.247 --> 1:06:22.499
- Bye, Daisy.
- Don't wave at anyone.

1:06:31.300 --> 1:06:32.927
You were staring slightly.

1:06:32.968 --> 1:06:36.263
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No. Goodness me, no.

1:06:37.181 --> 1:06:40.017
- I apologise for my rudeness.
- Oh.

1:06:40.726 --> 1:06:43.229
He's apologising, Jip.
Shall we forgive him?

1:06:46.398 --> 1:06:47.399
He says we shall.

1:06:48.943 --> 1:06:52.321
- Thank you, Jip.
- Think nothing of it, sir.

1:06:52.363 --> 1:06:54.698
- Speaks very well.
- It was actually me.

1:06:55.574 --> 1:06:57.868
I like to pretend he speaks.

1:06:57.910 --> 1:07:00.162
Some people think it idiotic.

1:07:00.204 --> 1:07:02.915
Oh, no.
I do it myself all the time.

1:07:02.957 --> 1:07:06.794
Don't I, Mr... Apple Tree?

1:07:06.835 --> 1:07:08.337
Yes.

1:07:08.379 --> 1:07:09.880
Yes.

1:07:10.589 --> 1:07:13.008
I'm David Copperfield.

1:07:14.009 --> 1:07:15.552
Are you still being the tree?

1:07:15.594 --> 1:07:17.972
- No.
- I'm Dora...

1:07:20.099 --> 1:07:21.559
- ...Spenlow.
- Spenlow?

1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:23.352
Dora Spenlow?

1:07:23.394 --> 1:07:26.063
Yes. I don't know
why I said it like that.

1:07:26.105 --> 1:07:28.857
Dora... Spenlow.

1:07:28.899 --> 1:07:32.778
- I don't usually stop in the middle.
- Trotwood! Mr Spenlow!

1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:34.488
- Sorry.
- Yes.

1:07:35.864 --> 1:07:37.116
Bye-bye.

1:07:37.157 --> 1:07:40.369
- Sorry? What was that?
- Just Jip.

1:07:40.411 --> 1:07:43.372
Bye-bye. Tree. Apple tree.

1:07:44.039 --> 1:07:45.207
I know.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:48.043
- Sorry?
- I know.

1:07:51.046 --> 1:07:53.215
Agnes, have you seen Mr Sp...?

1:07:54.008 --> 1:07:56.677
- You look very striking.
- Thank you.

1:07:56.719 --> 1:07:57.928
I'm in love.

1:07:58.554 --> 1:08:00.723
- Really?
- Utterly.

1:08:00.764 --> 1:08:02.141
With Dora... Spenlow.

1:08:02.182 --> 1:08:06.270
- I don't know why I said it like that, but...
- Ah. The girl with the yapping dog.

1:08:06.312 --> 1:08:09.273
- What a face.
- What a voice that comes out of it.

1:08:10.566 --> 1:08:11.650
Do you mock me?

1:08:13.527 --> 1:08:16.655
I do. I do. With affection
but entirely without mercy.

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:19.365
And up. Yes.

1:08:19.408 --> 1:08:21.577
Do you know Papa and I
are also moving to London?

1:08:21.619 --> 1:08:23.454
Oh, I see.

1:08:23.495 --> 1:08:27.499
You probably think I'm following you.
"Help me. I'm being followed by Agnes."

1:08:27.541 --> 1:08:30.836
"She's as persistent as a bluebottle
in a sash window."

1:08:31.462 --> 1:08:32.796
Oh, sorry.

1:08:34.798 --> 1:08:38.052
Mr Spenlow.
Apologies for my earlier distracted state.

1:08:38.093 --> 1:08:42.388
I look forward tremendously, Mr Spenlow,
to joining Spenlow & Jorkins, Mr Spenlow.

1:08:42.431 --> 1:08:45.892
- Excellent. Ready to become a proctor?
- Eager to become a proctor.

1:08:45.935 --> 1:08:47.311
That's the attitude.

1:08:47.977 --> 1:08:49.396
Let's celebrate.

1:08:51.190 --> 1:08:53.150
What is a proctor?

1:08:53.191 --> 1:08:55.069
I haven't the faintest idea.

1:08:55.110 --> 1:08:58.571
But I'll take possession of my own apartments
and soon I'll find out.

1:09:02.284 --> 1:09:04.995
That's Dora... Spenlow.

1:09:05.037 --> 1:09:06.038
Ah.

1:09:06.622 --> 1:09:08.082
I don't know who that is.

1:09:14.879 --> 1:09:19.343
<i>I returned to London for the first time
since I fled the bottling factory in rags.</i>

1:09:19.385 --> 1:09:22.303
<i>This time I was a gentleman,
with money in his pocket.</i>

1:09:23.012 --> 1:09:25.099
<i>I was a proctor.</i>

1:09:25.682 --> 1:09:27.726
I don't suppose you know
what a proctor is?

1:09:27.767 --> 1:09:31.396
Oh, now you're asking.
Do they make hats?

1:09:33.315 --> 1:09:36.485
<i>I had a generous monthly allowance
from my aunt.</i>

1:09:37.611 --> 1:09:39.863
<i>This paid for my training
with Mr Spenlow</i>

1:09:39.905 --> 1:09:42.740
<i>and allowed me
to live London life to the full.</i>

1:09:52.501 --> 1:09:55.963
A proctor is a sort of monkish attorney.

1:09:56.005 --> 1:09:57.006
I see.

1:09:58.340 --> 1:10:02.469
Mind these floorboards.
They squeak.

1:10:02.511 --> 1:10:03.512
There we are.

1:10:04.471 --> 1:10:07.600
<i>I never learned
what a proctor was an attorney of</i>

1:10:07.641 --> 1:10:09.560
<i>but I soon excelled about the office.</i>

1:10:11.395 --> 1:10:13.230
Floor!

1:10:14.565 --> 1:10:17.776
<i>And I was conveniently positioned
to seek out my first,</i>

1:10:17.818 --> 1:10:22.740

That's what I like to hear: nothing.

1:10:38.255 --> 1:10:39.715
Miss Spenlow.

1:10:39.757 --> 1:10:43.469

was practising upstairs.

I'll bring something to throw at you.

1:11:10.037 --> 1:11:12.831

1:11:12.873 --> 1:11:15.459
Yes. Lovely.

Flowers.

1:11:37.606 --> 1:11:42.069
Dora, lovers have loved before,
but no lover shall ever love as we love.

1:11:43.112 --> 1:11:45.781
That's very complicated, but thank you.

1:11:47.199 --> 1:11:48.951
Thank you.

Who wants lobster? Lobster?

1:12:30.159 --> 1:12:31.243
- Mm.
- Yes.

1:12:31.285 --> 1:12:34.496
I'm very familiar
with the lobster people of Yarmouth.

1:12:34.538 --> 1:12:37.166
Do the lobster people of Yarmouth
worship lobsters?

1:12:37.207 --> 1:12:38.918
Do they take on their characteristics?

1:12:39.501 --> 1:12:43.422
If you're thinking of travelling
to Yarmouth soon, might I join you?

1:12:43.464 --> 1:12:46.300
- Let's all go to Yarmouth, huh?
- No.

1:12:46.342 --> 1:12:48.761
- Well, I want to.
- Then you shall.

1:12:48.802 --> 1:12:50.596
It would be fun
to be a part of that world.

1:12:51.263 --> 1:12:55.267
In the city
I can be prone to a heavy mind.

1:12:56.018 --> 1:12:57.478
Do you have a heavy mind?

1:12:58.812 --> 1:13:00.189
He's got a heavy mind.

Pretty, black-eyed Susan she is called.

- No, he didn't.

1:14:17.891 --> 1:14:19.935

That's very good.

Agnes, did you tell Mr Copperfield
about my new position?

1:14:34.408 --> 1:14:35.993
Uriah has joined the firm.

1:14:36.952 --> 1:14:38.996
An apprentice to Mr Wickfield.

1:14:39.038 --> 1:14:43.167
Ury couldn't make progress any faster

Oh, Mother, please.

- Wonderful.

1:15:24.959 --> 1:15:28.295
Very generous, but I may be nearing
the limits of my capacity.

Wait.

1:15:35.803 --> 1:15:39.056
You called her Agnes just now,
not Miss Wickfield.

Dora, I'd like to ask you...

1:17:16.195 --> 1:17:19.531
Mr Copperfield,
your landlady sends a message.

1:17:19.573 --> 1:17:24.286
A man with a kite and a severe lady
have arrived and need to see you now.

1:17:24.328 --> 1:17:27.706
- At my lodgings?
- Yes. Now.

1:17:27.748 --> 1:17:31.835
- You were going to ask me if...?
- If you would wait for my question later.

1:17:46.684 --> 1:17:49.979
- Trotwood, I'm ruined.
- Like a castle.

1:17:50.020 --> 1:17:54.066
- So, Mr Dick suggested we come here.
- Ruined? But how can you be ruined?

1:17:54.108 --> 1:17:56.902
- Like a big castle.
- Because I've lost everything, Trot.

1:17:56.944 --> 1:17:59.405
- In the mining way and the banking way.
- Banking, mining.

1:18:01.824 --> 1:18:06.704
<i>Mr Wickfield cannot fully explain why,
but our money is gone.</i>

1:18:06.745 --> 1:18:12.751
<i>We've had to say farewell to lovely Janet,
close up the house and walk away</i>

1:18:12.793 --> 1:18:14.211
from our beautiful garden.

1:18:14.253 --> 1:18:16.672
Like a paradise for donkeys now.

1:18:17.506 --> 1:18:21.760
My shares have plummeted
like lead droppings from a stone goose.

1:18:21.802 --> 1:18:26.390
And all I have left are my clothes,
my porcelain bird

1:18:26.432 --> 1:18:27.975
and my Hesperis Diviniana.

1:18:28.017 --> 1:18:30.185
- It's the plant.
- And Mr Dick.

1:18:30.227 --> 1:18:31.353
It's me.

1:18:32.062 --> 1:18:33.898
No, this can't happen.

1:18:33.939 --> 1:18:39.069
I'll never again let light and goodness
turn to gloom, as it did in my past.

1:18:39.111 --> 1:18:42.740
Well, we're not the only ones to suffer.
There are two bailiffs' carts in this street.

1:18:42.781 --> 1:18:45.451
Surely Mr Wickfield
has been monitoring your affairs?

1:18:45.492 --> 1:18:49.371
- Mr Wickfield has troubles of his own.
- He often sleeps during the day.

1:18:49.413 --> 1:18:50.706
Because of...

1:18:51.790 --> 1:18:56.045
I have no notion what that spasmodic gesture
is supposed to indicate.

1:18:56.086 --> 1:18:58.672
If you're talking about overindulgence,

1:18:58.714 --> 1:19:01.800
have you returned
to the bottling business of your youth?

1:19:02.509 --> 1:19:05.554
- I entertained some friends.
- I beg your pardon?

1:19:05.596 --> 1:19:09.475
Well, they seemed to number
the entire populace of the city.

1:19:09.516 --> 1:19:11.936
You'll have no money for that now.

1:19:11.977 --> 1:19:14.897
Mr Dick, can you cast any more light
on what has happened?

1:19:14.939 --> 1:19:16.148
Yes, I can.

1:19:16.190 --> 1:19:20.069
The day before yesterday, she said:
"Mr Dick, I am ruined".

1:19:20.110 --> 1:19:22.738
And I said: "Oh, indeed?"
And then we travelled here.

1:19:24.156 --> 1:19:26.617
That's not a lot of light.

1:19:26.659 --> 1:19:28.911
We had bottled porter
and sandwiches.

1:19:28.953 --> 1:19:30.913
Do you understand what ruin means?

1:19:32.248 --> 1:19:36.752
It means distress
and want and starvation.

1:19:39.964 --> 1:19:42.007
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1:19:46.095 --> 1:19:48.847
"By what earthly power
do you condemn me?"

1:19:48.889 --> 1:19:50.599
"By what authority?"

1:19:50.641 --> 1:19:53.227
Mr Dick, we must try to keep
a cheerful countenance.

1:19:53.811 --> 1:19:56.355
- Yes?
- Absolutely. Cheerful.

1:19:56.397 --> 1:19:58.941
There's what looks like a bit of meat
stuck on the wall.

1:20:01.193 --> 1:20:02.194
What?

1:20:03.195 --> 1:20:05.656
We'll ensure
this cannot happen again.

1:20:05.698 --> 1:20:10.744
Although that's problematic, considering
I've no idea how it happened in the first place.

1:20:10.786 --> 1:20:14.248
But, of course,
we'll authorise a loan to tide you over.

1:20:14.290 --> 1:20:17.418
Thank you. I promise repayment will occur
just as soon as something...

1:20:17.459 --> 1:20:18.877
Something turns up?

1:20:19.753 --> 1:20:21.171
With respect, Mr...
Excuse me.

1:20:23.132 --> 1:20:26.635
With respect, Mr Wickfield,
I think a more sober judgement is required

1:20:26.677 --> 1:20:28.804
when considering a loan of this nature.

1:20:28.846 --> 1:20:29.930
I am sober.

1:20:29.972 --> 1:20:33.142
Mr Copperfield, I'm afraid
a loan is out of the question. Apologies.

1:20:33.183 --> 1:20:35.436
Do you have authority here, Uriah?

1:20:35.477 --> 1:20:39.565
Yes, and it's Mr Heep,
as in Wickfield & Heep.

1:20:40.149 --> 1:20:42.067
I am a partner.

1:20:44.904 --> 1:20:46.238
Agnes, could you...?

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.992
We are drinking
to the firm hands of Mr Heep

1:20:50.034 --> 1:20:53.537
who is grasping
or co-grasping the tiller.

1:20:53.579 --> 1:20:58.250
Yes, we can all of us, man and woman,
benefit from having a partner.

1:20:58.292 --> 1:20:59.960
Do you not agree, Agnes?

1:21:00.878 --> 1:21:04.256
In times of trouble we must all do
that which we must do.

1:21:04.298 --> 1:21:07.134
Small heavy cakes
to go with the sherry.

1:21:07.885 --> 1:21:09.929
Like tasty billiard balls.

1:21:11.347 --> 1:21:12.765
Mother, have you seen?

1:21:13.474 --> 1:21:15.684
Oh, Ury.

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:19.355
- Those two are weeds.
- Get a drink for Mr Wickfield.

1:21:19.396 --> 1:21:21.815
I've seen a pair like them before.

1:21:21.857 --> 1:21:26.946
Unchecked, they will overrun and choke
all life and joy from this place.

1:21:27.905 --> 1:21:31.700
- They must be stopped.
- I fear the time for that has passed.

1:21:31.742 --> 1:21:34.578
- To partnerships.
- Partnerships.

1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:38.874
I'm far too humble to say
that I've saved this firm, but...

1:21:41.627 --> 1:21:43.837
Uriah has been very good
for our business.

1:21:43.879 --> 1:21:48.592
He has. He's been diversifying
in smaller rental properties.

1:21:48.634 --> 1:21:52.805
In parts of London
that aren't necessarily first choice.

1:21:52.846 --> 1:21:56.350
Is one of these properties
to be my only choice?

1:22:06.527 --> 1:22:07.987
<i>This is your new lodgings.</i>

1:22:09.488 --> 1:22:12.908
It may be not the most spacious
of properties,

1:22:12.950 --> 1:22:18.497
but it would suit someone
in your circumstances very well indeed.

1:22:18.539 --> 1:22:22.209
I am not someone
in my circumstances.

1:22:22.251 --> 1:22:23.502
No, of course.

1:22:23.544 --> 1:22:27.715
- At least we won't get lost in here.
- Can't fly your kite in here.

1:22:27.756 --> 1:22:31.760
Well, you can't fly a kite in a house anyway.
There's no breeze. See?

1:22:31.802 --> 1:22:34.013
No, I bow to your expertise.

1:22:34.054 --> 1:22:36.890
Can't fly his kite
but he could swat an irritant.

1:22:38.392 --> 1:22:40.352
Well, enjoy your lodgings.

1:22:40.394 --> 1:22:44.899
If any problems arise,
I suggest you tend to them yourselves.

1:22:45.774 --> 1:22:48.527
- He's a fellow.
- We'll make do.

1:22:48.569 --> 1:22:52.406
Ale for me now. Much better for you
than wine anyway, much less bilious.

1:22:52.448 --> 1:22:54.491
I should like to make a contribution.

1:22:55.784 --> 1:22:57.870
- Oh, Mr Dick.
- Will you...?

1:23:00.706 --> 1:23:02.124
And it's this.

1:23:08.130 --> 1:23:13.302
I would have been shut up
to lead a very dismal life these last years

1:23:13.344 --> 1:23:14.845
if you hadn't taken me in,

1:23:15.471 --> 1:23:18.849
the way David's friends
took those orphans in in Yarmouth.

1:23:18.891 --> 1:23:21.644
Wait. Yarmouth. What's today?

1:23:21.685 --> 1:23:24.480
- Oh, I know this. Uh, Wednesday.
- It's Tuesday, Trot.

1:23:24.521 --> 1:23:27.900
Tuesday? I should be meeting Steerforth
to take him to Yarmouth.

1:23:27.942 --> 1:23:29.526
He'll be waiting for me.

1:23:32.321 --> 1:23:34.198
I could postpone.

1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:35.866
No, no. Go, go.

1:23:36.659 --> 1:23:38.702
Mr Dick and I, meanwhile, will...

1:23:38.744 --> 1:23:42.998
We will, uh, transform this
into the most desirable mousehole in London.

1:23:51.924 --> 1:23:53.926
Sorry! Pardon me!

1:23:53.968 --> 1:23:55.803
Sorry, ma'am!

1:24:09.608 --> 1:24:13.279
Apologies for my lateness.
I've just been in my apartment,

1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:15.990
which is there...

1:24:16.031 --> 1:24:20.369
Two bags? Such extravagance,
given how much the coach people charge.

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:26.667
Ah. Uh, no, this contains laundry
for my housekeeper to collect.

1:24:27.251 --> 1:24:29.211
Hm. Curious arrangement.

1:24:29.253 --> 1:24:32.506
We should get to the Spread Eagle.
Our coach leaves in ten minutes.

1:24:53.444 --> 1:24:57.114
- <i>I hope you like the boathouse.</i>
- <i>With the lobster people?</i>

1:24:57.156 --> 1:24:59.199
<i>The lobster people are rough,</i>

1:24:59.241 --> 1:25:03.037
<i>but the dwelling itself
is such a sparkling sight to behold.</i>

1:25:06.665 --> 1:25:08.918
What a delightful residence.

1:25:10.294 --> 1:25:12.588
In my recollection
it was more colourful.

1:25:14.715 --> 1:25:15.799
Peggotty?

1:25:15.841 --> 1:25:19.637
Oh! Hello! Davy.

1:25:19.678 --> 1:25:21.722
Oh, look at you.

1:25:21.764 --> 1:25:25.809
You've growed out of all knowledge.
You in good kelter, boy?

1:25:26.602 --> 1:25:30.105
Good kelter, I... are.
Yes, I'm very well, thank you.

1:25:30.147 --> 1:25:32.566
This is my dear friend,
James Steerforth.

1:25:33.442 --> 1:25:36.946
This young man's affections for you are such
that I feel like I know you all.

1:25:36.987 --> 1:25:39.990
- Aw.
- Peggotty, it's such an honour to meet you.

1:25:40.032 --> 1:25:42.034
Oh, you have a lovely speaking voice.

1:25:43.494 --> 1:25:47.039
- That's a very bright waistcoat.
- It's brocade. Savile Row.

1:25:47.081 --> 1:25:48.999
That's a row in London.

1:25:50.292 --> 1:25:53.128
See, now, we mardled plenty
with this 'un when he was a nipper,

1:25:53.170 --> 1:25:55.839
and we're uncommon proud of him, thankee.

1:25:55.881 --> 1:25:57.633
That's dialect, isn't it?

1:25:58.384 --> 1:26:02.012
I am fascinated in how language changes
around the country.

1:26:02.054 --> 1:26:05.724
We can write it down for you
if it's too difficult. We can write.

1:26:06.392 --> 1:26:08.644
- Come through here. It's the perfect...
- Mind your head!

1:26:09.562 --> 1:26:11.981
It's the perfect little bedroom
I told you about.

1:26:12.022 --> 1:26:13.274
Mind your head!

1:26:14.149 --> 1:26:15.442
Ah!

1:26:15.484 --> 1:26:17.319
Mrs Gummidge ain't well.

1:26:17.361 --> 1:26:20.531
She brings up more than she eats these days.
Don't you, my love?

1:26:20.573 --> 1:26:23.701
They say it can't be done.
But I does it.

1:26:25.286 --> 1:26:27.580
- Look who's here, Emily.
- Davy!

1:26:27.621 --> 1:26:29.248
Mind your head.

1:26:29.290 --> 1:26:31.584
- How are you?
- Good to see you again, Davy.

1:26:31.625 --> 1:26:33.919
- My friend, James Steerforth.
- Oh.

1:26:34.628 --> 1:26:37.339
- And to meet you, sir.
- Emily.

1:26:37.381 --> 1:26:40.634
Daisy tells me that you like to climb
the masts of sailing boats.

1:26:40.676 --> 1:26:42.636
You can see for miles up there.

1:26:42.678 --> 1:26:45.139
All the ladies off to the ball
at Browston Manor.

1:26:45.180 --> 1:26:48.100
Did you just call Davy Daisy?

1:26:48.142 --> 1:26:49.852
Is that dialect?

1:26:49.894 --> 1:26:53.480
We've no food, so don't expect food.

1:26:53.522 --> 1:26:56.609
- We do have food.
- Fish.

1:26:56.650 --> 1:26:59.987
I imagine you and Ham
have been married for some years now.

1:27:00.029 --> 1:27:02.615
- No.
- Still engaged, still not married.

1:27:02.656 --> 1:27:05.659
- Oh.
- Been saving up, though, haven't we?

1:27:05.701 --> 1:27:08.454
Trying to decide
where we might want to live.

1:27:08.495 --> 1:27:09.580
We wanna live here,

1:27:09.622 --> 1:27:12.333
knock up our own boathouse,
a couple of hundred yards up the coast.

1:27:12.374 --> 1:27:14.126
Or we could go further.

1:27:14.168 --> 1:27:17.087
Of course we could.
Half a mile, three quarters even.

1:27:17.129 --> 1:27:18.964
Oh, Peggotty.

1:27:19.548 --> 1:27:24.803
I fear I'm going to be sick
in a substantial way.

1:27:24.845 --> 1:27:27.348
No matter.
Our floor is a beach.

1:27:28.557 --> 1:27:31.602
- Bucket coming through. Excuse me.
- I'll just grab my bag.

1:27:31.644 --> 1:27:33.479
Mind your head!

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:37.858
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
I'll see you again very soon.

1:27:40.069 --> 1:27:43.072
That stern looks like new, my friend.
Splendid.

1:27:43.113 --> 1:27:45.991
<i>I found it curious
how almost immediately</i>

1:27:46.033 --> 1:27:47.701
<i>and without the least effort,</i>

1:27:47.743 --> 1:27:51.288
<i>Steerforth managed to charm
and beguile my Yarmouth friends.</i>

1:27:51.330 --> 1:27:54.333
The manager,
he turns to me and he says:

1:27:54.375 --> 1:27:58.545
"I've had 30 people
use that towel before you, sir,

1:27:58.587 --> 1:28:01.590
and you're the first
to complain that it's dirty."

1:28:04.885 --> 1:28:08.180
- Look at him.
- He's faster than me.

1:28:08.222 --> 1:28:13.477
- Very nice knife work there, Mr Steerforth.
- Why, thank you. I could be a murderer.

1:28:13.519 --> 1:28:15.229
Very nice work.

1:28:19.608 --> 1:28:23.070
Steerforth, Ham and Emily
were just saying the same as me,

1:28:23.112 --> 1:28:25.406
that everyone loves James Steerforth.

1:28:25.447 --> 1:28:26.532
Ha!

1:28:26.574 --> 1:28:29.702
Everyone except James Steerforth,
my dear friend.

1:28:33.163 --> 1:28:35.666
Did you have enough money
to pay for the drinks?

1:28:35.708 --> 1:28:37.084
- Plenty.
- Are you sure?

1:28:37.126 --> 1:28:38.210
Yes, I am.

1:28:38.252 --> 1:28:43.507
Promise me, Daisy, won't you,
that you'll think of me at my best?

1:28:44.091 --> 1:28:45.759
Promise me that much.

1:28:45.801 --> 1:28:47.761
Yes. You seem low.

1:28:48.762 --> 1:28:51.765
- Where's this sudden cloud come from?
- Who's up for a shanty?

1:28:53.684 --> 1:28:57.813

<i>Your last night.</i>

1:29:26.216 --> 1:29:28.469
I'm gonna miss this little routine.

1:29:29.261 --> 1:29:31.931
There you go.
Got a bit of privacy for you now.

1:29:32.514 --> 1:29:36.852
- That's all I do have at the moment.
- Oh, I know, my love.

1:29:36.894 --> 1:29:40.356
But you had nothing, then you had something,
now you've got nothing again,

1:29:40.397 --> 1:29:43.442
so stands to right
you'll have something again.

1:29:43.484 --> 1:29:46.320
- I wish I could be so sure it worked like that.
- Uncle!

1:29:46.362 --> 1:29:49.073
Have you seen all that herring
with their guts still intact?

1:29:49.114 --> 1:29:51.408
- Uncle.
- What's that Emily been up to?

1:29:52.326 --> 1:29:54.036
Emily's written you a note, Uncle.

1:29:59.500 --> 1:30:00.584
"Dear Uncle,

1:30:00.626 --> 1:30:05.464
when you, who love me
better than I deserve, read this,

1:30:06.298 --> 1:30:08.175
I shall have gone far away

1:30:08.217 --> 1:30:11.804
and will not return
unless he brings me back as a lady."

1:30:12.846 --> 1:30:15.307
- Emily.
- And Steerforth.

1:30:16.934 --> 1:30:18.727
They'll be in the boat he rented.

1:30:21.939 --> 1:30:23.440
<i>We set off in the morning,</i>

1:30:24.191 --> 1:30:26.402
<i>and I pray you do not come after.</i>

1:30:28.362 --> 1:30:32.241
<i>Ham, love some good girl
that'll be true to you.</i>

1:30:32.825 --> 1:30:34.451
Emily! Emily, jump!

1:30:34.493 --> 1:30:35.703
No, Ham!

1:30:35.744 --> 1:30:38.706
<i>And forget me as if I died
and were buried somewhere.</i>

1:30:39.498 --> 1:30:40.666
Steerforth!

1:30:41.542 --> 1:30:44.295
Send word if that louse's mother knows
where they've gone.

1:30:50.759 --> 1:30:52.845
<i>Don't search for me.</i>

1:30:53.762 --> 1:30:55.180
<i>Don't come looking.</i>

1:30:58.851 --> 1:31:00.519
<i>For you will not know me...</i>

1:31:02.897 --> 1:31:04.940
<i>...even if you find me.</i>

1:31:07.192 --> 1:31:09.737
<i>For he will have made me a lady.</i>

1:31:12.114 --> 1:31:15.951
A lady?
She's far below him. A lady!

1:31:18.287 --> 1:31:19.455
Could you?

1:31:21.790 --> 1:31:25.961
All I've chosen to ignore in your son
of snobbery...

1:31:26.962 --> 1:31:29.798
...and an unyielding, wilful spirit
I see in you, madam.

1:31:30.424 --> 1:31:31.425
I beg your pardon?

1:31:34.887 --> 1:31:35.971
Do you see this?

1:31:36.764 --> 1:31:39.808
- It's tea.
- And this and this and this. Tea.

1:31:39.850 --> 1:31:42.311
Every Wednesday,
James joins me here for tea

1:31:42.353 --> 1:31:47.024
and this tea shall not be removed
from the table until he returns.

1:31:47.066 --> 1:31:48.234
That shall be his welcome.

1:31:49.526 --> 1:31:54.323
Well, I'm sure he'll find it
cold and stale. Door.

1:31:58.202 --> 1:32:00.746
And as for her,
if there were any word of comfort

1:32:00.788 --> 1:32:03.165
that would be of solace to her
in her dying hour,

1:32:03.207 --> 1:32:06.252
I wouldn't part with it for life itself.

1:32:08.295 --> 1:32:10.631
- You looking for a lift, sir?
- No.

1:32:16.887 --> 1:32:19.014
I think I know what you're about to say.

1:32:19.056 --> 1:32:21.350
You have no reason
to worry about my answer.

1:32:21.392 --> 1:32:22.726
I need to tell you...

1:32:23.936 --> 1:32:25.354
I have no money.

1:32:26.230 --> 1:32:28.023
I don't fully understand.

1:32:29.942 --> 1:32:32.361
- I'm poor.
- Well, no matter.

1:32:32.403 --> 1:32:37.199
But, Jip must have a mutton chop
every day at 12 or he will die.

1:32:37.241 --> 1:32:41.370
Precisely. So how, my love,
should we get the meat?

1:32:43.998 --> 1:32:45.291
So, my answer is yes.

1:32:45.332 --> 1:32:48.627
I will marry you, Doady.
Let's go and tell Papa.

1:32:49.420 --> 1:32:51.505
Let's do that,
for I am so happy.

1:32:53.882 --> 1:32:55.926
- Did he...?
- He did!

1:32:56.552 --> 1:33:01.098
Congratulations, Dora and Trotwood.

1:33:04.643 --> 1:33:06.228
That is wonderful.

1:33:07.187 --> 1:33:09.023
You will have a happy lifetime.

1:33:09.940 --> 1:33:12.818
- Lifetime?
- 60 years at least.

1:33:14.069 --> 1:33:17.323
Too many people in this street
for me to get a run with my kite.

1:33:17.865 --> 1:33:19.450
Ah, now, look.

1:33:20.451 --> 1:33:22.494
Ah. Can't go that way, Mr Dick.

1:33:22.536 --> 1:33:25.039
The gentleman who makes my waistcoats
is up there

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:28.792
and I haven't been able
to fully clear my debt with him, so...

1:33:30.169 --> 1:33:31.879
We'll head over this way.

1:33:39.345 --> 1:33:41.805
Mr...? Mr Micawber?

1:33:45.517 --> 1:33:48.812
My dear young friend.

1:33:48.854 --> 1:33:50.981
And I believe Mr Dixon?

1:33:51.565 --> 1:33:54.151
- Are you well?
- Never better.

1:33:55.027 --> 1:33:57.321
- Right.
- And how's Mrs Micawber?

1:33:57.905 --> 1:34:00.407
In even finer fettle than I am.

1:34:01.116 --> 1:34:02.868
There she is over there.

1:34:02.910 --> 1:34:05.120
With our happy tribe of dependents.

1:34:07.873 --> 1:34:09.541
Do you live on the streets now?

1:34:09.583 --> 1:34:13.212
Well, uh, we do currently exist
primarily <i>al fresco</i>

1:34:13.254 --> 1:34:16.131
but with all the advantages
that that entails.

1:34:16.173 --> 1:34:17.633
It's much better living outside.

1:34:18.384 --> 1:34:20.219
Every meal's a picnic.

1:34:20.261 --> 1:34:22.429
- Segment?
- Oh, thank you.

1:34:26.016 --> 1:34:30.020
David Copperfield.
Might you help me, Master David?

1:34:30.062 --> 1:34:31.480
Yes. What do you need?

1:34:31.522 --> 1:34:34.984
I popped me concertina
with the Floral Street pawnbroker.

1:34:35.943 --> 1:34:37.152
I'd love it back

1:34:37.194 --> 1:34:41.699
but he knows me and he will charge
much more than the six bob that it's worth.

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:43.534
I need a surrogate.

1:34:47.663 --> 1:34:50.332
- How much for the concertina?
- Ten bob.

1:34:53.168 --> 1:34:55.921
What if I offered you six shillings?

1:34:56.964 --> 1:34:57.965
No.

1:34:59.425 --> 1:35:05.222
But I can let you have a fishing rod
for six shillings.

1:35:13.564 --> 1:35:14.565
Is that a concertina?

1:35:15.816 --> 1:35:19.194
- With all due respect, is that a concertina?
- It's not a concertina.

1:35:19.236 --> 1:35:22.031
No. What we need is the concertina.

1:35:22.865 --> 1:35:24.325
You tricked me.

1:35:24.366 --> 1:35:27.202
All right. You can have
the damn squeezebox.

1:35:28.495 --> 1:35:31.457
For 11 shillings. Actually, no.

1:35:32.124 --> 1:35:35.419
Twelve shillings.
Thirteen shillings. A pound.

1:35:35.461 --> 1:35:37.087
You can have it for a pound.

1:35:37.796 --> 1:35:40.758
- How much for the mad wax biscuits?
- Yeah.

1:35:41.634 --> 1:35:45.304
The wax seals.
Interesting story about them, actually.

1:35:45.346 --> 1:35:46.555
I basically... Oi!

1:35:47.139 --> 1:35:50.434
- Run! I'm a criminal!
- There's the concertina!

1:35:50.476 --> 1:35:51.977
Oi!

1:35:53.854 --> 1:35:56.774
I preferred, I think,
the larger apartment.

1:35:59.610 --> 1:36:03.030
We were sadly not able
to express a preference.

1:36:03.072 --> 1:36:06.825
I'm sure it's only small
because Doady is saving for a castle.

1:36:06.867 --> 1:36:09.328
Is he really, do you think?

1:36:09.370 --> 1:36:11.664
Will the lady be in soon
with some tea?

1:36:12.665 --> 1:36:16.460
I will fetch some tea.
The lady does not exist.

1:36:16.502 --> 1:36:19.088
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Will she ever?

1:36:20.798 --> 1:36:23.801
Dora, when I was your age,

1:36:23.842 --> 1:36:27.638
I made an unsuitable marriage.

1:36:28.430 --> 1:36:32.726
With a man.
I've, uh, bitterly regretted it ever since.

1:36:32.768 --> 1:36:38.399
We were simply very young
and incompatible.

1:36:42.152 --> 1:36:43.153
Oh.

1:36:46.365 --> 1:36:48.534
I'm so sorry
you found the wrong man.

1:36:48.576 --> 1:36:51.203
It makes me doubly happy
that I found the right one.

1:36:53.122 --> 1:36:54.832
Bless me, you're very young.

1:37:04.925 --> 1:37:09.263
- If anything, it plays sweeter than before.
- Bravo.

1:37:09.305 --> 1:37:13.767
What an adventure we have had.
You know, you should write about all of this.

1:37:13.809 --> 1:37:14.810
Peggotty!

1:37:16.687 --> 1:37:19.982
- Peggotty.
- Davy, my precious potato.

1:37:22.568 --> 1:37:25.279
- Mr Micawber. Mr Dick.
- It's Peggotty.

1:37:25.321 --> 1:37:29.116
- What brings you to London?
- Well, Dan and Ham asked me to come.

1:37:29.158 --> 1:37:31.785
You know, they've been searching
all this time for Emily.

1:37:31.827 --> 1:37:32.912
Emily!

1:37:32.953 --> 1:37:35.789
<i>They've been up and down the country
trying to look for her.</i>

1:37:35.831 --> 1:37:37.666
Ham even sailed all the way to France

1:37:37.708 --> 1:37:41.337
cos he heard that Emily
and... that man had been seen.

1:37:41.378 --> 1:37:43.047
But now they're looking in London.

1:37:43.088 --> 1:37:45.716
They've narrowed it down
to a few streets to the east.

1:37:45.758 --> 1:37:46.842
Emily!

1:37:46.884 --> 1:37:49.053
They've gonna find her, Davy.
I just know it.

1:37:49.094 --> 1:37:51.597
A most arduous expedition.

1:37:51.639 --> 1:37:53.807
I doff what remains of my hat to them.

1:37:53.849 --> 1:37:56.977
You need to love those that help you out
and help out the ones you love.

1:37:57.019 --> 1:37:58.520
That's a Peggotty proverb.

1:37:59.271 --> 1:38:01.523
You're a very charitable woman.

1:38:04.193 --> 1:38:05.611
Mr Micawber...

1:38:07.238 --> 1:38:08.781
I'd love to.

1:38:11.283 --> 1:38:13.244
Where shall I put these?

1:38:13.285 --> 1:38:16.372
Which one of you
requires a change of nature? Come on.

1:38:17.248 --> 1:38:20.334
Are my... papers anywhere?

1:38:20.376 --> 1:38:25.297
And you've, uh...
You've never given a professional recital?

1:38:25.339 --> 1:38:29.176
That's a very perceptive question.
I have never been seriously approached.

1:38:29.218 --> 1:38:31.929
Peggotty, have you seen
my papers anywhere?

1:38:31.971 --> 1:38:36.225
You should write a story
about our adventure at the pawn shop.

1:38:36.267 --> 1:38:37.685
That would make a cracking tale.

1:38:37.726 --> 1:38:41.105
I should try to write it down
if I could just find my...

1:38:41.146 --> 1:38:45.192
No, no, no, Trot. No, not "try".
You will write it down.

1:38:45.234 --> 1:38:47.361
- You're a writer, Trot.
- Hear, hear!

1:38:47.403 --> 1:38:49.196
Where? I can barely
move my elbows in here.

1:38:49.238 --> 1:38:51.740
- Oh! Shall we...?
- Yeah, I think we should.

1:38:51.782 --> 1:38:53.284
Step this way.

1:38:54.201 --> 1:38:56.370
We've prepared somewhere
for you to write, Trot.

1:38:56.412 --> 1:38:59.039
Next batch of children
for the chamber pot.

1:38:59.081 --> 1:39:01.417
You probably want a bit of privacy.
Sorry. Come on.

1:39:01.458 --> 1:39:04.878
- It's a little room.
- Write time.

1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:07.423
- There you are. Peace and quiet.
- Here.

1:39:12.886 --> 1:39:15.723
"A house made from a boat."

1:39:15.764 --> 1:39:18.183
"Draw a house or draw a boat."

1:39:19.894 --> 1:39:21.186
"Or draw a boat."

1:39:25.190 --> 1:39:26.442
Do you see this?

1:39:26.483 --> 1:39:27.651
"Do you see this?"

1:39:27.693 --> 1:39:28.777
It's tea.

1:39:28.819 --> 1:39:30.404
"Tea."

1:39:30.446 --> 1:39:32.364
- It's tea.
- "It's tea."

1:39:33.157 --> 1:39:36.535
This tea shall not be removed
from the table until he returns.

1:39:36.577 --> 1:39:38.662
"Until he returns."

1:39:39.788 --> 1:39:44.001
<i>She was a clever woman.
She brought everything to a grindstone</i>

1:39:44.043 --> 1:39:47.588
<i>and sharpened it as she had sharpened
her own face and figure over the years.</i>

1:39:53.344 --> 1:39:54.970
<i>Mr Micawber,</i>

1:39:55.012 --> 1:39:59.141
<i>a rake-thin, middle-aged person,
carried a jaunty sort of stick.</i>

1:39:59.183 --> 1:40:00.768
More creditors.

1:40:01.352 --> 1:40:04.438
<i>His methods for avoiding creditors
were as inventive</i>

1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:06.190
<i>as they were elaborate.</i>

1:40:08.984 --> 1:40:10.611
Oi! I know who you are!

1:40:10.653 --> 1:40:11.654
<i>Come here!</i>

1:40:13.530 --> 1:40:14.823
<i>Work hard.</i>

1:40:14.865 --> 1:40:18.577
Procrastination is the thief of time, David.
Collar him!

1:40:19.161 --> 1:40:20.955
"Collar him!"

1:40:20.996 --> 1:40:22.248
<i>In my factory</i>

1:40:22.289 --> 1:40:26.085
<i>pistons nodded
like melancholy mad elephants.</i>

1:40:26.126 --> 1:40:28.963
<i>I became one of those
who live solitarily in great cities,</i>

1:40:29.004 --> 1:40:31.048
<i>like in a bucket of a human well.</i>

1:40:31.090 --> 1:40:33.133
<i>You can't take
from someone who has nothing!</i>

1:40:33.175 --> 1:40:35.386
I deserve more than this, far more.

1:40:35.427 --> 1:40:37.680
I need more, sir. Please, sir.

1:40:38.764 --> 1:40:41.475
<i>My Aunt Betsey was
a tall, hard-featured lady...</i>

1:40:41.517 --> 1:40:42.601
Janet!

1:40:42.643 --> 1:40:46.730
<i>...with quick bright eyes
and the most kind and forgiving spirit.</i>

1:40:47.815 --> 1:40:50.818
My mind is as clear as a soap bubble!

1:40:50.859 --> 1:40:53.571
<i>Mr Dick moved
as if playing the kettledrums.</i>

1:40:53.612 --> 1:40:56.865
<i>Peggotty had cheeks and arms
so hard and red</i>

1:40:56.907 --> 1:40:59.910
<i>that I wondered the birds did not peck her
instead of the apples.</i>

1:40:59.952 --> 1:41:01.996
<i>Mr Murdstone was firm.</i>

1:41:02.037 --> 1:41:04.790
<i>Nobody in his world was to be so firm
as Mr Murdstone,</i>

1:41:05.374 --> 1:41:09.253
<i>for everybody was to be bent
to his firmness.</i>

1:41:09.878 --> 1:41:13.507
Everyone except James Steerforth,
my dear friend.

1:41:13.549 --> 1:41:17.219
<i>There was a passionate dejection
in Steerforth's manner that amazed me.</i>

1:41:17.261 --> 1:41:19.305
What a confident gentleman he is.

1:41:19.346 --> 1:41:22.308
<i>Uriah Heep hovered
like a great vulture,</i>

1:41:22.349 --> 1:41:24.476
<i>gorging himself on our company.</i>

1:41:24.518 --> 1:41:27.813
I'm thrilled to make your acquaintance,
Master Copperfield.

1:41:27.855 --> 1:41:30.065
"Master Copperfield."

1:41:30.107 --> 1:41:32.276
<i>I'm in deep humility.</i>

1:41:32.318 --> 1:41:35.237
<i>It's as if he lives in your nose
and is keen to get home.</i>

1:41:36.155 --> 1:41:37.239
<i>Agnes.</i>

1:41:37.281 --> 1:41:38.449
Yes.

1:41:38.490 --> 1:41:40.701
<i>Agnes. Agnes. Agnes.</i>

1:41:40.743 --> 1:41:43.329
<i>You look very striking.
I'm in love. Utterly.</i>

1:41:43.370 --> 1:41:46.749
<i>They will overrun and choke
all life and joy from this place.</i>

1:41:47.499 --> 1:41:49.209
<i>They must be stopped, Agnes.</i>

1:41:51.587 --> 1:41:56.050
<i>For weeks Agnes had been observing
Heep's every movement</i>

1:41:56.091 --> 1:41:58.260
<i>with meticulous care.</i>

1:41:58.302 --> 1:42:01.722
<i>Finally, she entered the dwelling
in high spirits.</i>

1:42:06.435 --> 1:42:08.854
The door was open.
Is this anyone's little boy?

1:42:08.896 --> 1:42:11.190
Think he's one of ours, yes.

1:42:11.232 --> 1:42:14.777
Goodness. So many people.
Will the floor hold up?

1:42:14.818 --> 1:42:18.197
Miss Trotwood, do you have a letter
bearing my father's signature?

1:42:18.239 --> 1:42:20.449
One moment. One moment.

1:42:20.491 --> 1:42:24.286
- Agnes. Is something wrong?
- Something's about to be made right.

1:42:25.871 --> 1:42:29.083
Ha!
I think maybe this. There it is.

1:42:29.124 --> 1:42:30.584
Yes.

1:42:31.293 --> 1:42:34.505
Uriah Heep's fate is in here.
But I need your help.

1:42:34.546 --> 1:42:37.466
- Gather round.
- Oh, gather. Gather round.

1:42:42.930 --> 1:42:46.559
Mr Copperfield and Miss Wickfield.
Two fields.

1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:48.310
Neither lying fallow, I hope.

1:42:48.352 --> 1:42:50.187
- Clever.
- Tiresome.

1:42:50.229 --> 1:42:53.274
- Yes, I was being polite.
- You're not busy, Uriah?

1:42:53.315 --> 1:42:58.070
Mr Heep is very busy.
Doing the work of two men, sadly.

1:42:58.112 --> 1:43:02.366
Well, Mr Heep, we're here to talk to you
about Miss Trotwood's investments.

1:43:02.950 --> 1:43:06.704
- More people. Oh, it's a party.
- This doesn't feel like a party.

1:43:06.745 --> 1:43:08.956
Shall I make us a bowl of punch?

1:43:09.623 --> 1:43:12.459
We need a lemon. Miss Trotwood,
you look like you're sucking one.

1:43:12.501 --> 1:43:14.128
Now, you fellow...

1:43:15.546 --> 1:43:18.340
Mr Heep, you have stolen my money

1:43:18.382 --> 1:43:20.884
and you have embezzled funds
from this firm.

1:43:20.926 --> 1:43:22.094
That's slander.

1:43:22.136 --> 1:43:24.638
- Anyone else here wanna defame me?
- I do!

1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:25.764
And me.

1:43:25.806 --> 1:43:27.057
I put it to you

1:43:27.099 --> 1:43:30.561
that, for your own
pecuniary aggrandisement,

1:43:30.603 --> 1:43:36.025
you falsified documents
in order to mystify an individual

1:43:36.066 --> 1:43:39.153
whom I will designate in code
as Mr W.

1:43:39.194 --> 1:43:40.613
Wickfield?

1:43:41.947 --> 1:43:43.449
- Maybe.
- Prove it.

1:43:43.490 --> 1:43:46.327
To prove it we would need access
to certain documents.

1:43:46.368 --> 1:43:51.290
But, Agnes, wherever might we find
such documents?

1:43:51.332 --> 1:43:52.958
I believe they used to be in that bureau.

1:43:56.462 --> 1:43:59.632
All you've done is prove you're thieves.
You've stolen my documents.

1:43:59.673 --> 1:44:03.552
Stole? Can Mr Wickfield's daughter
not tidy up her father's paper?

1:44:03.594 --> 1:44:06.347
- They were in a locked drawer.
- I'm an enthusiastic tidier.

1:44:06.388 --> 1:44:08.807
You stole this lady's house,
you stupid little turnip.

1:44:08.849 --> 1:44:11.977
Mr Dick, what do you think?

1:44:15.356 --> 1:44:17.191
- Swans.
- Where?

1:44:17.233 --> 1:44:18.317
- Swans?
- Swans?

1:44:18.359 --> 1:44:19.443
- Swans?
- Swans?

1:44:21.237 --> 1:44:26.200
I've been studying these,
and when Mr Wickfield signs his name,

1:44:26.242 --> 1:44:27.826
the W looks like a swan.

1:44:28.577 --> 1:44:31.497
But when Mr Heep
mimics his signature,

1:44:31.538 --> 1:44:35.000
his W looks like an upturned hip bath.

1:44:35.042 --> 1:44:37.503
You forged my signature!

1:44:37.544 --> 1:44:41.215
You're the source of this calamity, Heep.
A thousand curses upon you.

1:44:41.257 --> 1:44:43.592
I take it back.
A thousand and four.

1:44:43.634 --> 1:44:46.512
Agnes, if you have any love
for your babbling father,

1:44:46.553 --> 1:44:48.639
you'll leave this gang and marry me.

1:44:48.681 --> 1:44:50.808
- I will ruin him otherwise.
- Never.

1:44:50.849 --> 1:44:52.643
Ury, make terms. Be humble.

1:44:52.685 --> 1:44:57.356
No, Mother!
No more! No more of this!

1:44:57.398 --> 1:45:00.693
No more pulling off our caps,
making bows.

1:45:01.735 --> 1:45:04.655
Knowing our place
and abasing ourselves before our betters!

1:45:04.697 --> 1:45:06.448
No more of it!

1:45:06.490 --> 1:45:08.075
Do you know what I want?

1:45:08.117 --> 1:45:10.828
What? A straitjacket? A husband?

1:45:11.453 --> 1:45:14.540
- I want my home.
- Well, I ain't got it.

1:45:15.291 --> 1:45:18.669
You and yours have always hated
me and mine. And who are ya?

1:45:18.711 --> 1:45:20.129
A fine set of people.

1:45:20.170 --> 1:45:24.633
You, Copperfield, were pure scum
before anyone had charity on ya.

1:45:24.675 --> 1:45:27.720
And you, Miss T,
you're a grim old prospect.

1:45:27.761 --> 1:45:30.264
No wonder your old man
knocked you about.

1:45:37.271 --> 1:45:40.065
- Aahh!
- Now stove his head in with a cake.

1:45:40.107 --> 1:45:43.777
And in case that wasn't clear enough,
you're dismissed with immediate effect.

1:45:43.819 --> 1:45:47.114
You were always a puppy
with a proud stomach,

1:45:47.156 --> 1:45:50.701
riding on the coat tails
of that vile creature who called you Daisy.

1:45:50.743 --> 1:45:52.119
Trotwood.

1:45:52.161 --> 1:45:53.954
- Davy.
- Doady.

1:45:53.996 --> 1:45:55.664
My name is David Copperfield.

1:45:56.916 --> 1:45:59.126
I forgive ya, Mr Copperfield.

1:45:59.168 --> 1:46:02.338
It is not for you
to forgive anyone, Mr Heep.

1:46:02.379 --> 1:46:04.048
Isn't that right, Jip?

1:46:04.089 --> 1:46:05.633
Yes, it is.

1:46:06.550 --> 1:46:07.968
What's she doing here?

1:46:10.804 --> 1:46:12.890
There's no reason for me to be here.

1:46:14.975 --> 1:46:16.143
I wasn't there.

1:46:16.185 --> 1:46:18.520
Heep happened yesterday,
and I was away.

1:46:18.562 --> 1:46:21.565
I know, but I'm writing it now
and I want you to be in it.

1:46:21.607 --> 1:46:23.359
I fear I don't properly fit.

1:46:24.652 --> 1:46:26.904
I want you to be in all my stories.

1:46:28.447 --> 1:46:31.200
No, I don't belong. Write me out of it.

1:46:31.242 --> 1:46:33.118
But I still want to be of some use.

1:46:35.079 --> 1:46:36.956
May I hold your pens?

1:46:51.011 --> 1:46:53.973
- Do let me know when you need a new pen.
- Yes.

1:46:59.895 --> 1:47:01.605
I really don't fit.

1:47:04.650 --> 1:47:06.402
Write me out, Doady.

1:47:18.372 --> 1:47:21.000
- Davy! Davy!
- Yes.

1:47:21.041 --> 1:47:24.211
You have to come right now.
I think we've found Emily.

1:47:39.435 --> 1:47:42.062
Someone saw her in this building.
I hope she's here.

1:47:42.104 --> 1:47:45.399
- That's Mrs Steerforth's carriage.
- Does that mean her son's with her?

1:47:45.441 --> 1:47:46.817
- Em?
- Emily?

1:47:46.859 --> 1:47:50.237
- Emily, my love, Peggotty's here.
- Emily?

1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:52.364
Emily?

1:47:53.657 --> 1:47:55.492
- We're here.
- Emily?

1:47:58.162 --> 1:48:01.790
Do you ever think
of the home you have wrecked?

1:48:01.832 --> 1:48:02.833
Of course.

1:48:03.626 --> 1:48:05.085
Every day.

1:48:06.170 --> 1:48:08.172
- Poor Uncle.
- Not your home.

1:48:08.213 --> 1:48:11.175
His. Mine.

1:48:11.216 --> 1:48:13.844
A veil of shame hangs over me
because of what you made my son do.

1:48:13.886 --> 1:48:14.970
Where is he?

1:48:15.012 --> 1:48:16.597
- I don't know.
- I can hear her.

1:48:16.639 --> 1:48:19.350
- Through here. Emily!
- Worthless creature!

1:48:19.391 --> 1:48:21.268
- She's in here.
- Tell me!

1:48:21.310 --> 1:48:24.021
- Leave me alone!
- I imagine you want this discarded toy.

1:48:24.063 --> 1:48:27.191
She was just a trifle
for the occupation of an hour!

1:48:27.233 --> 1:48:28.943
Enough, madam. That is vile.

1:48:28.984 --> 1:48:32.029
When James was at his truest
he loved me.

1:48:32.071 --> 1:48:35.157
I will leave when I have news of my son,
and not before.

1:48:35.199 --> 1:48:38.410
- Do you understand me?
- Tell her, Em, and then let's leave. Please.

1:48:38.452 --> 1:48:41.497
Let's get going.
This house feels like it's gonna blow away.

1:48:41.538 --> 1:48:44.208
There's a big storm coming.
We'd better leave now.

1:48:44.250 --> 1:48:47.086
At least tell me, Em,
if you won't tell her.

1:48:48.337 --> 1:48:50.256
Is that snake with you?

1:48:50.297 --> 1:48:51.548
No.

1:48:52.591 --> 1:48:54.134
He fled from me.

1:48:55.135 --> 1:48:56.553
In France.

1:48:57.846 --> 1:48:59.098
Steerforth abandoned you?

1:49:01.141 --> 1:49:03.227
I'm no good for you.

1:49:03.269 --> 1:49:06.021
I'm no good for anyone.
Think of me at my best.

1:49:09.817 --> 1:49:12.861
How can you do that
and still call yourself a man?

1:49:12.903 --> 1:49:17.116
I've been here ever since,
scared I might never be forgiven.

1:49:17.157 --> 1:49:19.743
My love, of course you're forgiven.

1:49:19.785 --> 1:49:22.204
Do you know,
does Steerforth plan to return?

1:49:22.246 --> 1:49:23.414
Yes, he does.

1:49:24.331 --> 1:49:26.917
Tomorrow night.
He's sailing into Yarmouth.

1:49:26.959 --> 1:49:28.836
He wants to say sorry, Davy.

1:49:28.877 --> 1:49:33.799
Tomorrow? That's mad.
The storm will be at its peak. It's suicide.

1:49:35.426 --> 1:49:36.802
Come on, lend a hand!

1:49:39.805 --> 1:49:41.265
Quickly, now!

1:49:42.099 --> 1:49:43.475
Come on, now!

1:49:46.729 --> 1:49:49.732
- What's happened?
- A wreck close by, sir.

1:49:49.773 --> 1:49:52.151
- How many in? How many out?
- Two out.

1:49:53.068 --> 1:49:56.238
Second man out now.
At least one more out there.

1:50:00.784 --> 1:50:03.203
- That's Steerforth.
- Mates, make me ready.

1:50:03.871 --> 1:50:06.415
- Get me some rope. I'm going in.
- Please, no.

1:50:06.457 --> 1:50:08.417
Ham, you can't.
You know who that is.

1:50:08.459 --> 1:50:10.377
If my time has come,
then it's come,

1:50:10.419 --> 1:50:13.964
but I am not watching another man die,
even if it's that man there. Rope.

1:50:14.924 --> 1:50:16.592
Tie it right. Tie it right.

1:50:16.634 --> 1:50:18.844
- Boy, I don't want you to do this.
- Ham!

1:50:21.472 --> 1:50:22.514
Ham!

1:50:27.686 --> 1:50:30.189
- It's like he's taunting us.
- No.

1:50:30.898 --> 1:50:34.193
Not taunting us.
Maybe taunting himself.

1:50:38.364 --> 1:50:40.783
- Go on, Ham!
- Ham!

1:50:44.995 --> 1:50:46.956
Steerforth!

1:50:50.292 --> 1:50:52.086
We have to go now!

1:50:53.671 --> 1:50:56.006
Steerforth, come to me.

1:50:56.715 --> 1:50:58.175
Give me your hand.

1:51:00.386 --> 1:51:01.637
Steerforth!

1:51:06.892 --> 1:51:09.186
He was lost
beneath the rugged foam.

1:51:11.564 --> 1:51:12.565
I stood...

1:51:14.149 --> 1:51:15.818
...unable to move a step.

1:51:18.487 --> 1:51:21.115
"Does he live?", I asked.

1:51:29.582 --> 1:51:31.709
He was everything.

1:51:33.294 --> 1:51:36.005
I wanted him to live, Davy,
whatever he'd done.

1:51:37.756 --> 1:51:41.051
But, by God, I wish to God
you'd never brought him here,

1:51:41.093 --> 1:51:43.095
into our world to ruin it.

1:51:44.388 --> 1:51:48.100
I brought you here. And Emily.
And Mrs Gummidge.

1:51:48.142 --> 1:51:51.228
Now, you have a care, Ham.
This isn't Davy's fault.

1:51:55.065 --> 1:51:56.483
Em.

1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:09.079
No!

1:52:09.872 --> 1:52:13.125
<i>And now
I have nothing left to tell.</i>

1:52:14.251 --> 1:52:15.836
<i>Unless, indeed, I were to confess</i>

1:52:16.545 --> 1:52:19.298
<i>that this narrative is far more
than mere fiction.</i>

1:52:20.758 --> 1:52:23.719
<i>It is, in fact, written memory,</i>

1:52:24.678 --> 1:52:27.348
<i>wherein loss and love</i>

1:52:28.098 --> 1:52:29.767
<i>live forever side by side.</i>

1:52:32.561 --> 1:52:36.982
Agnes, sometimes in my writing
I can say things...

1:52:37.024 --> 1:52:38.943
I will love you all my life.

1:52:43.656 --> 1:52:46.450
Its people are as real as earth.

1:52:47.743 --> 1:52:49.703
And my truest hope

1:52:49.745 --> 1:52:55.251
is that I might grow half as strong and wise
in the telling of their story

1:52:55.292 --> 1:52:57.336
as they have grown in the living of it.

1:52:59.505 --> 1:53:00.881
Thank you.

1:53:25.531 --> 1:53:29.076
Hello. Hello, you little darling.

1:53:29.118 --> 1:53:31.328
- Hello.
- A-boo-boo-boo.

1:53:31.370 --> 1:53:34.123
- Hello.
- A-boo-boo-boo.

1:53:35.791 --> 1:53:37.459
Are you smiling?

1:53:50.931 --> 1:53:53.183
"Kite" as a verb. It's very good.

1:53:53.225 --> 1:53:55.394
All right, Master Davy?

1:53:55.436 --> 1:53:59.481
You know, in your book,
you could have made me younger and taller.

1:53:59.523 --> 1:54:01.901
He wrote you as 20
in years and feet.

1:54:01.942 --> 1:54:04.987
- Really?
- He hasn't read it, Davy.

1:54:05.029 --> 1:54:07.907
- But you've lived it, Mr Peggotty.
- That's right.

1:54:08.532 --> 1:54:10.409
- Betsey.
- Oh, Trotwood.

1:54:10.451 --> 1:54:14.121
You've saved my home
and I don't know how to thank you.

1:54:15.956 --> 1:54:18.083
- Oh, donkeys. There's...
- No, no, no.

1:54:18.667 --> 1:54:19.668
No.

1:54:20.502 --> 1:54:23.130
We'll set the donkeys
to one side for now.

1:54:23.714 --> 1:54:26.467
Congratulations on the book.

1:54:27.927 --> 1:54:30.512
Odd to think
my words bought this house.

1:54:30.554 --> 1:54:33.599
Fine depiction
of that villain Heep, eh?

1:54:33.641 --> 1:54:38.020
I think we both played a very clever game,
you and I, catching that fellow.

1:54:38.062 --> 1:54:40.231
- Well done, us.
- Aye.

1:54:42.399 --> 1:54:44.151
Mrs Micawber.

1:54:44.193 --> 1:54:45.861
Mr Micawber.

1:54:45.903 --> 1:54:47.571
I'm glad you could make it.

1:54:47.613 --> 1:54:50.241
Oh, young David.

1:54:50.282 --> 1:54:54.370
You saved myself, Wilkins,
and our sweet angels from the streets.

1:54:54.411 --> 1:54:58.290
No, no. Your presence in my writing
has repaid me many times over.

1:55:01.585 --> 1:55:02.586
Uh...

1:55:03.796 --> 1:55:07.049
Luckily, I find myself between
paid jobs at the present moment

1:55:07.091 --> 1:55:10.803
so that has allowed us the freedom
to travel down to your beautiful home.

1:55:10.844 --> 1:55:14.390
- Coach fare was...
- Well, we barely considered the costs.

1:55:14.431 --> 1:55:15.474
Indeed, we barely...

1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:18.185
There you are, Mr Micawber.

1:55:18.227 --> 1:55:21.021
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

1:55:21.063 --> 1:55:22.982
- An IOU is in order.
- Yes.

1:55:23.023 --> 1:55:24.400
There's no need.

1:55:28.487 --> 1:55:30.322
- From writing?
- Yes

1:56:03.230 --> 1:56:04.648
Don't worry.

1:56:05.524 --> 1:56:06.942
You'll make it through.

1:56:08.027 --> 1:56:10.404
And you'll have quite the ride
on the way.
