01:51.111 --> 01:53.906
Run! Run!

01:55.908 --> 01:57.284
Hurry!

02:00.037 --> 02:02.081
Come on, run!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.853
Stop her, you maggots!

03:05.895 --> 03:07.897
Do it now!

03:36.508 --> 03:39.720
Oi. I told you already.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.722
You get your cut
after I get mine.

03:41.764 --> 03:42.890
- Fly along now.
- No.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.475
I'm coming with you this time.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.477
Like hell you are.
We need you here.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.396
- You're our last sparrowhawk.
- I'm done, okay?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.565
Find some other Pix
to muster passengers for you.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.650
I'm going to the Burgue.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.234
You know the deal.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.653
Lest you can pay,
you best get

03:55.694 --> 03:57.488
your twiggy little ass
back to shore.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.407
With all due respect, Captain,
I'm not leaving.

04:00.449 --> 04:05.037
Get the fuck off my ship
before I throw you off.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.038
Try it.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.539
I just came from that rock

04:07.581 --> 04:09.458
your lads
won't even set foot on,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.293
and I've cut down
tougher things than you

04:11.335 --> 04:13.253
in the past five minutes.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.386
It's the coastal battery!

04:24.181 --> 04:25.849
Fuck it.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.267
Get her in the hold.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.852
Let's get out of here, lads.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.438
Move!

04:38.654 --> 04:39.947
Thank you.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.588
Excuse me.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.381
Excuse me, miss.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.551
I just wanted to say thank you.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.428
For what you done.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.806
Folks are saying you're the one
that arranged for the passage.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.475
Please don't thank me.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.393
You'll still have to pay them.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.980
Or work off your fee
in the Burgue.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.483
What I did wasn't anything.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.068
It was everything.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.737
You gave us all a fighting
chance at a better life.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.534
I-I hope so.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.745
Is that a Burguish soldier?

06:12.081 --> 06:13.373
Yes.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.250
He's somebody
I knew from the war.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.128
You and he, were you...?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.589
Look, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.218
I had a tryst
with a Burguish rifleman once.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.636
Curiosity, mostly,

06:25.677 --> 06:28.347
but he was a nice enough lad.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.102
It was a bit more
than that for me.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.020
Is that why you're headed
to the Burgue?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.105
To be with him?

06:37.648 --> 06:40.275
No.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.194
He died.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.822
In the last Pact advance.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.783
I'm sorry.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.547
Oi!

09:07.589 --> 09:08.882
What's your hurry, love?

09:08.924 --> 09:10.342
Come up and see me.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.683
See, you can't sell this
Critch bilge out on the Row.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.685
Not without a permit.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.105
Now, fortunately,
it's your lucky day.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.232
'Cause we can sell you one.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.901
Um, I need to speak
with my father.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.653
Oh, he's not here now,
is he?

09:29.695 --> 09:32.739
Used to be a big shot doctor
back in his country, he was.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.242
Really?
And now he pushes this dross.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.829
All right, come on, there.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.789
Get this shit out of here,
all right?

09:40.831 --> 09:43.101
- You can't have this stall here anymore...
- You gonna pick that up?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.252
What'd you say?

09:45.294 --> 09:47.105
- Thatch, no, no, no. Don't.
- It's all right, it's all right.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.839
Thatch.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.050
'Cause it seemed to me that you
was asking for a civics lesson.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.178
You don't want to do that.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.180
Ooh. Or else what?

10:00.434 --> 10:01.434
Oh!

10:04.813 --> 10:06.523
You might want to change
your trousers.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.525
No, stay down, stay down. Stop it!

10:08.567 --> 10:10.527
Sorry, Inspector.
He's just joined.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.696
Are you off your trolley?
Do you know who that is?

10:12.738 --> 10:13.947
Thank you, Inspector.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.574
- How's your father?
- Good.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.743
What brings you to the Row
this morning?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.786
A case.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.753
She woke up last night.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.755
She's lucid?
She's talking?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.215
Yeah. By Titania's grace.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.053
Magrite, my love,

10:36.094 --> 10:38.096
this is Inspector Philostrate.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.973
You can call me Philo.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.600
You're police?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.477
I am.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.896
I've been charged
with finding the man responsible

10:45.937 --> 10:47.939
for these attacks.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.609
Unseelie Jack.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.194
That's what
they've been calling him.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.739
What us Critch
have been calling him, you mean.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.533
Jack would never take

10:58.575 --> 11:00.077
the clawhammer to your kind.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.995
You can talk to him, Mags.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.831
He's one of the good ones.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.667
I've talked
to some of the others.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.921
At least,
the ones who can talk.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.091
I'm afraid
I didn't get very far.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.051
I was hoping
you could tell me more.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.678
Help me bring this man...
well, if we can call him that...

11:18.720 --> 11:20.806
to justice.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
Can I have some tea?

11:25.394 --> 11:27.104
Of course.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.736
You're from Anoun.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.365
I spent some time in
the Tirnanese highlands myself

11:38.407 --> 11:41.243
during the war.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.121
I was stationed in a mimasery.

11:46.873 --> 11:51.253
One of the most beautiful places
I've ever seen.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.507
With some of the bravest people
I've ever known.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.302
Sometimes I feel
like I left my heart behind.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
Me, too.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.770
I hate to ask you
to relive this.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.773
I know it's painful.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.568
But this man is still out there,

12:14.609 --> 12:17.404
hunting innocent fae folk.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.823
Every three weeks,
another one.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.741
It's been three weeks
since your attack.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.577
He's gonna do it again.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.787
We have to stop him.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.039
I need your help.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.251
Please.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.550
I heard him

12:38.592 --> 12:40.594
before I saw him.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.349
He called me a Pix whore.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.731
Said he could smell it on me.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.941
The darkness.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.110
Do you remember
what he looked like?

12:57.152 --> 13:00.071
His head was shaved,

13:00.113 --> 13:03.200
except for the hair
on the side of his face.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.660
Muttonchops.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.332
He had a tattoo on his forearm.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.375
Of what?

13:12.417 --> 13:15.253
A snake, I think.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.549
Anything else?

13:19.591 --> 13:23.011
The smallest detail
could lead to his arrest.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.852
He wore a uniform.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.191
A uniform?

13:36.233 --> 13:38.193
What kind of uniform?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.195
Was it police?

13:40.237 --> 13:41.738
Military?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.198
Do you know?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.700
I haven't been here long.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.704
No.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.165
'Course not.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.132
Thank you.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.568
You've been very helpful,
very brave.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.970
I can tell
you're from the highlands.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.055
Hmm.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.642
Mr. Philo.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.730
I can see you're a good man.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.357
I hope you find

14:17.399 --> 14:20.110
what you lost there.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.948
You as well.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
Careful, Franny!

14:35.542 --> 14:38.086
Not so close, Peter!

14:38.128 --> 14:40.672
You heard Nanny.
Come back at once.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.717
Never mind her,
silly old goat.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.013
By the Martyr, look!

14:48.054 --> 14:50.056
A shipwreck!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.978
Run back.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.438
Get a constable.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.231
Hurry!

15:18.543 --> 15:21.546
The Critch are
swarming our city.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.259
They are changing the very
fabric of our society.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.678
And not for the better.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.598
They bring vices, wantonness,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.850
the scourge of lixer addiction,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.144
the worship of strange gods.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.729
- That's right.
- Agreed.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.689
Our streets are safe no more.

15:39.731 --> 15:44.194
Whole boroughs have become
off-limits to decent citizens.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.491
The people look
to their chancellor for relief.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.992
What do they find instead?

15:51.034 --> 15:54.746
A majority content
to do nothing!

15:58.291 --> 16:01.336
It would seem
that good Proctor Longerbane

16:01.378 --> 16:04.339
has forgotten why the fae folk

16:04.381 --> 16:07.258
were forced to flee their lands
in the first place.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.427
Exactly. Exactly.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.805
Because the party he leads

16:11.846 --> 16:15.433
chose to let Tirnanoc fall
into the hands of the Pact!

16:17.102 --> 16:19.896
Let's not forget
which party dragged us

16:19.938 --> 16:23.108
into that misbegotten adventure
in empire making.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.863
It was a war we could have won.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.615
- Yeah!
- Yes!

16:30.657 --> 16:33.827
It was a war we should have won!

16:36.705 --> 16:38.707
See how he dodges

16:38.748 --> 16:39.999
the issue at hand.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.544
Burguishmen
can't find honest work

16:42.585 --> 16:45.255
because the Critch do their jobs
for a pittance!

16:47.799 --> 16:50.802
If Proctor Longerbane wishes

16:50.844 --> 16:53.680
to send the fae folk
back to whence they came,

16:53.722 --> 16:57.767
let him amass
a majority of votes to do so.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.061
Hmm?

17:00.103 --> 17:02.856
Making laws is the province

17:02.897 --> 17:05.483
of this august chamber.

17:05.525 --> 17:10.113
Mine is but to see those laws
duly enforced.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.409
So, that doesn't include the law

17:14.451 --> 17:18.454
against consorting
with Pix harlots.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.790
The audacity!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.917
To impugn my family honor!

17:23.960 --> 17:26.337
Impugn? How?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.343
His slurs matter not.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.848
The Breakspear name

17:36.890 --> 17:39.350
is above reproach.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.312
Even so, that you should have
to tolerate such impudence

17:42.353 --> 17:43.938
when it's you
that holds the majority.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.149
Mm, by but a blade's margin.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.818
The slightest misstep could
cost me the chancellorship.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.822
Jonah.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.328
Good morning, Father.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.165
Hello, Mother.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.464
Above reproach.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.716
Indeed, husband.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.389
And where have you been?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.391
Out with friends.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.144
- All night.
- It would seem.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.688
Not on Carnival Row, I trust.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.357
Of course not.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.150
No, you-you've been quite clear

18:29.192 --> 18:31.653
about the boundaries
of my comings and goings.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.364
You're the chancellor's son,
Jonah.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.367
You can't give your father's
enemies any ammunition.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.285
Rest assured, I'd sooner die

18:39.327 --> 18:42.330
than become an embarrassment
to my dear, beloved father.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.293
It's your future
that concerns me, Jonah.

18:47.335 --> 18:51.172
Don't worry.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.258
My future's daffodils
and rainbows

18:53.299 --> 18:55.301
as far as the eye can see.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.646
Fellow Burguishmen!

19:06.688 --> 19:09.148
Your city is under siege!

19:09.190 --> 19:11.150
But you are not alone!

19:11.192 --> 19:13.194
Have your voice heard!

19:18.324 --> 19:20.285
So, have you caught him yet?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.911
Tourmaline.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.580
It's been three weeks
since the last one.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.307
I expect he'll be
on the prowl tonight, won't he?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.791
Good to see you, too.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.751
I'm just wondering
if I should make a point

19:28.793 --> 19:31.212
of running my errands
before sundown.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.382
I'd have had him by now

19:34.424 --> 19:36.467
if more of the victims
had been forthcoming.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.470
Yeah, well, a bloke with a badge
knocking on your door

19:39.512 --> 19:42.223
isn't exactly a relief
where they come from.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.434
What?

19:44.475 --> 19:47.729
I will grant you,
the police are no angels,

19:47.770 --> 19:49.314
but we're not the bloody Pact.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.065
Yeah, but you lot left us
to them,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.859
just like you'd leave us
to Jack.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.153
It's what people are saying.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.155
Right.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.448
How bad is it?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.116
Do I need to be worried
about riots?

20:00.158 --> 20:02.368
It's tense.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.787
A racist with a hammer
is beating us

20:04.829 --> 20:06.247
where he finds us,
and we don't see

20:06.289 --> 20:07.933
too many of you lot out here
giving a shit.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.709
You looking for trouble?

20:09.751 --> 20:12.462
Yeah, you're not
in Sheep-Land anymore,

20:12.503 --> 20:14.047
you fuckin' trotter.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.798
This city belongs to us!

20:15.840 --> 20:18.593
You'd do well to remember that!

20:18.635 --> 20:20.511
Anyway, this Jack business.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.555
I can tell you where I'd look.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.309
Which is what you're doing here.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.395
Last victim said
he had muttonchops.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.190
Hmm. Well, look at you.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.692
Did you see this?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.277
Another wreckage.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.654
Came from Anoun.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.405
Any survivors?

20:39.447 --> 20:41.449
Are there ever?

20:41.491 --> 20:44.786
She was found on the
shore just off Cape Tairn.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.579
It's just what
this fucking city needs,

20:46.621 --> 20:48.998
another Pix mouth to feed.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.963
Oi, wake up.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.006
Name?

21:00.009 --> 21:01.970
Name.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.098
Vignette. Vignette Stonemoss.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.100
Not yours, you daft thing,

21:07.141 --> 21:08.518
the sodding ship that went down.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.395
Oh, uh, Deliverance,
I think it was.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.705
Yeah, and you boarded her where?

21:11.729 --> 21:14.899
Near Anoun. Off the coast.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.693
They're smart,
these Critch runners.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.487
Sailing up and down the coast
just clear of Pact cannons, eh?

21:19.529 --> 21:21.739
Eh, not smart enough
to keep clear

21:21.781 --> 21:23.366
of the winter squalls,
though, are they?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.451
What happened to the others?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.203
All lost but you, darling.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.666
They wouldn't let us out
of the hold,

21:31.708 --> 21:34.752
even when the ship
started taking on water.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.046
If they let you out of the hold
and you'd winged ashore,

21:37.088 --> 21:39.716
you wouldn't be worth nothing
to 'em, now would you?

21:39.757 --> 21:42.969
Who are you contracted to?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.595
I don't know.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.432
Only that it was two years' work
for the passage.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.684
All right. Get her processed.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.686
And find out who
this ship is registered to,

21:51.728 --> 21:53.688
and make sure
she gets where she belongs.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.816
- Here.
- This way. Go.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.286
I wonder who he could be.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.763
It's the finest house
on the Crossing.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.330
He must be very rich.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.832
Oh, he'd have to be.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.959
Sent his solicitor
to the auction,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.879
bought the place sight unseen
is how I heard it.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.423
Sight unseen?

22:20.465 --> 22:23.051
Well, he must be very rich,
indeed.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.765
You expecting someone,
dear sister?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.641
No.

22:33.436 --> 22:36.355
Yes? Can I help you?

22:36.397 --> 22:38.441
I'm looking
for Mr. Ezra Spurnrose.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.401
It's all right, Afissa.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.654
I'm Ezra Spurnrose.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.991
You're the registered owner
of the sailing ship Deliverance?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.744
What's this all about?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.916
- Lost at sea.
- Surely,

22:54.957 --> 22:57.251
Mr. Spurnrose, you understood
the risks involved?

22:57.293 --> 22:59.796
Apparently not.

22:59.837 --> 23:02.256
I'm-I'm afraid I tied up
a considerable portion

23:02.298 --> 23:04.550
of my family assets
in this enterprise.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.636
Uh, I was approached to fund

23:06.677 --> 23:08.513
the purchase
and furbishment of the...

23:08.554 --> 23:11.057
the Deliverance
as a passenger vessel

23:11.099 --> 23:12.517
in return for a share

23:12.558 --> 23:15.061
of the profits earned
in bringing these...

23:15.103 --> 23:17.939
desperate wretches
to our shores.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.399
It's not illegal.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.360
Is it?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.028
No.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.489
But it ought to be,
if you ask me.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.825
We have more than enough

23:28.866 --> 23:30.701
Critch here already,
thank you very much.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.913
Now, as to the disposition

23:33.955 --> 23:36.124
of this here Pix.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.043
She's indentured
for the price of passage.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.461
50 guilders.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.463
You can sell that contract
to someone else,

23:42.505 --> 23:44.590
or you can keep her
as a domestic.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.717
Your choice.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.683
A lady's maid?

23:53.724 --> 23:55.351
Oh, Ezra!

23:55.393 --> 23:56.703
I've not had one
since poor Father died.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.480
Well, it is high time
we corrected

23:59.522 --> 24:01.566
that intolerable state
of affairs.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.608
Thank you.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.360
And I'm sorry.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.904
- Now, what for, dear?
- For doubting you

24:06.946 --> 24:09.448
and your ever mysterious
business ventures.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.618
Clearly, you are handling
our affairs most capably.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.331
What's your name, girl?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.208
Vignette.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.918
Well, come along, then.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.588
Let's get you cleaned up.
I think we still got

24:23.629 --> 24:25.631
the last girl's uniform
somewhere.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.427
You'll have Swansday off.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.946
Please attend
to personal matters then

24:30.970 --> 24:32.972
and not during the week.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.141
Sorry.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.019
The last girl we... Uh, milk?

24:38.060 --> 24:41.063
The last girl we had
had a veritable parade of kin

24:41.105 --> 24:43.399
popping in downstairs at all...
Oh, that-that's enough.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.276
At all hours
of the day and night.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.028
It was terribly annoying.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.030
Not to worry, miss.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.073
I have no kin to speak of.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.159
Oh, are they all
still in Tirnanoc?

24:53.201 --> 24:54.827
They're all dead.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.458
Well, of course,
I think it's dreadful

25:00.499 --> 25:02.376
that the Burgue
abandoned Tirnanoc

25:02.418 --> 25:04.629
to the ravages of the Pact.

25:04.670 --> 25:08.090
Taking in an unfortunate
such as yourself

25:08.132 --> 25:10.718
is the least we can do.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.386
You'll need to clean your nails

25:12.428 --> 25:15.097
- before you serve me tea again.
- Yes, miss.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.266
Well, it's no wonder
that it fits you so well.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.519
All you fae are so slight
and hollow-boned.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.647
I'm not sure about this braid,
though.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.732
Don't.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.486
Uh, I'm so-so sorry, miss.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.571
Please excuse me. I just...

25:30.613 --> 25:33.616
I don't have much else left.

25:33.658 --> 25:36.953
My braids tell who I am.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.455
Oh.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.999
How quaint.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.377
It reminds me
of someone I've lost.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.262
I do hope
you won't be any trouble.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.266
You may go.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.144
This is our city!

26:02.186 --> 26:04.981
It belongs to the Burguishmen!

26:06.983 --> 26:10.861
You need only look
at the godless hell

26:10.903 --> 26:13.030
these bestial shite races
have made

26:13.072 --> 26:14.615
of their own fucking lands

26:14.657 --> 26:16.033
to know what's at stake here!

26:18.536 --> 26:23.124
If Absalom Breakspear can't
put a stop to the tide of Critch

26:23.165 --> 26:25.001
swamping our shores,

26:25.042 --> 26:27.878
then let him step aside
for a man who can:

26:27.920 --> 26:29.839
Ritter Longerbane!

26:29.880 --> 26:31.882
- Longerbane!
- Longerbane!

26:31.924 --> 26:34.010
Ritter Longerbane!

26:34.051 --> 26:36.387
Ritter Longerbane!

26:43.978 --> 26:45.813
Well, it's a disgrace,
that's what it is.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.648
These used to be
respectable neighborhoods.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.108
Sergeant.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.110
What the fuck
are you doing here?

26:51.152 --> 26:53.487
Well, last I heard,
it wasn't illegal

26:53.529 --> 26:55.990
to gather with like-minded folk.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.367
Not even the sorts of folk
who might be happy

26:58.409 --> 27:00.619
to take a hammer
to a few faerish skulls, eh?

27:00.661 --> 27:03.039
You still after that bloke?
How long you gonna keep that up?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.583
Till I find him.
And I will find him.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.336
Yeah, well,
not among these fine gents.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.380
Oh, I don't know.
I think he might be close.

27:11.422 --> 27:12.882
Very close.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.800
What are you insinuating?

27:14.842 --> 27:16.552
Just that Jack's last victim

27:16.594 --> 27:18.804
said he might be
one of you Choppers.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.973
A bald one.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.142
Wearing a uniform, Sergeant.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.394
Well, these fucking Critch.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.772
They will say anything
to get attention,

27:27.813 --> 27:29.065
- won't they, lads?
- Right.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.274
Yeah. That's right.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.193
Then you won't mind

27:32.234 --> 27:33.903
showing me your arm, will you?

27:33.944 --> 27:37.198
I don't have to show you
a fucking thing.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.036
Look, I took an oath

27:42.078 --> 27:43.746
to protect the people
of this good city

27:43.788 --> 27:44.955
just like you did.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.457
Do you
and your like-minded folk

27:46.499 --> 27:48.542
consider the fae
among those people?

27:48.584 --> 27:50.127
Why do you care so bloody much?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.338
What's this strange affinity
you have for them?

27:52.380 --> 27:54.882
Because I served
beside their kind in the war.

27:54.924 --> 27:57.468
They put their lives
on the line, same as we did,

27:57.510 --> 27:59.571
and I'm just not sure
I like how this city has chosen

27:59.595 --> 28:01.514
- to repay them for it.
- Ah, right. The war.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.450
Yeah, I hear all sorts of things
happened over there.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.434
Oh, you heard, did you?

28:05.476 --> 28:07.812
I wouldn't blame a lad
for going a little heathen.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.563
No proper women around.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.816
Just all those beggared tinks

28:11.857 --> 28:14.819
happy to spread
for a shiny Burguish stiver.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.654
It's easy enough.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.072
Just close your eyes,

28:18.114 --> 28:20.157
think of your sweetheart
back home.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.577
See, I heard
it's like sticking your cock

28:23.619 --> 28:25.788
into a pail of greasy ferrets.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.124
Is that true?

28:30.418 --> 28:33.337
Stand up, and you'll regret it.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.049
Hey!

28:37.091 --> 28:39.427
Don't think I won't
fucking report you for this.

28:39.468 --> 28:40.803
Do it!

28:40.845 --> 28:43.305
I can't wait to tell 'em
where I found you.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.871
Good evening.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.165
Evening.

29:12.877 --> 29:13.878
Mrs. Fyfe.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.254
Mr. Philostrate.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.672
I kept your plate warm.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.257
Much obliged.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.426
Oh, you should be.

29:20.468 --> 29:23.179
Supper is served
between 6:00 and 7:00.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.940
- House rules.
- Come, Mr. Bagstock,

29:24.972 --> 29:28.309
20 minutes grace is the least
we can afford Mr. Philostrate,

29:28.350 --> 29:31.437
considering he spends his days
keeping our streets safe.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.189
It's favoritism, is what it is.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.899
Don't think I haven't noticed.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.933
Can't recall you've ever told me

30:08.974 --> 30:10.184
how this happened.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.646
I'm sure I have.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.858
It's a war wound.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.236
Yes, but you never told me how.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.281
I can't imagine...

30:24.323 --> 30:26.283
you'd want to know
more than that.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.660
Why not?

30:30.663 --> 30:33.958
Because not everyone
came back, I suppose.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.751
You mean my husband?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.839
It's been seven years.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.342
More.

30:43.384 --> 30:46.136
Sometimes the old wounds
hurt the most.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.014
I've made peace with my pain.

30:49.056 --> 30:52.059
It's yours I'm curious about.

30:56.313 --> 30:59.483
It was war
and it was hard, and...

30:59.525 --> 31:01.944
I did things I regret.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.446
I'm sure that's not
the whole of it.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.074
What if it is?

31:07.116 --> 31:10.536
What makes you so sure
there's a story worth hearing?

31:10.578 --> 31:13.539
Because you're
a man worth knowing.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.958
And men like you
are made of stories.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.626
Tell me one.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.339
Some other time. It's late.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.636
Right.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.555
Yes.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.265
I should go.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.274
Good night, Mr. Philostrate.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.612
Good night, Mrs. Fyfe.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.414
Is this really necessary?

31:55.456 --> 31:56.874
Well, we can't have you
flying away

31:56.915 --> 31:58.917
in the middle of the day,
now, can we?

31:58.959 --> 32:00.628
Lace up.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.714
You can go where you like
on your own time,

32:03.756 --> 32:08.677
but keep in mind that you're
always representing this house.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.388
To that end, I don't suppose
you know of a train

32:11.430 --> 32:13.974
going towards
the Tetterby Hotel, do you?

32:14.016 --> 32:16.143
What do you know of that place?

32:16.185 --> 32:18.812
A friend of mine came
to the Burgue a while ago.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.732
Heard she
might be staying there.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.818
The Tetterby is
a house of ill repute, girl.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.612
On Carnival Row.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.614
I must be mistaken, then.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.449
You see that you are.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.451
Now, listen, girl,

32:32.493 --> 32:35.829
I'll be keeping
a close watch on you.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.873
I've got a full belly
and a roof over my head,

32:37.915 --> 32:39.291
thanks to this family,

32:39.333 --> 32:41.543
and in this city,
that's no mean feat.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.004
So you mind yourself.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.877
Vignette?

33:25.754 --> 33:28.090
Are you just about
finished in here?

33:28.132 --> 33:30.134
Yes, ma'am.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.318
I would send you on an errand.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.696
Can I count on your discretion?

33:50.738 --> 33:52.030
Yes, ma'am.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.243
I need you to go to the Row
and have this refilled.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.166
- Tamphus Oil.
- Mm.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.227
Along with Calder root
and the Martyr knows what else.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.086
A drop behind each ear,
and men take notice

34:06.128 --> 34:07.755
of what they otherwise overlook.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.799
I may be plain, but at least
I'm clear-eyed about it.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.889
It is quite dear, yes.

34:16.929 --> 34:20.309
My brother would not approve
of such an expenditure.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.686
But then again,
he's not about to turn 23

34:22.728 --> 34:25.563
with few suitable prospects
for marriage, is he?

34:25.606 --> 34:27.274
Run along.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.194
Rumor has it our new neighbor
takes residence today,

34:30.235 --> 34:32.362
and it's a safe wager
Louisa Pembroke already has

34:32.404 --> 34:35.491
a new dress picked out to parade
herself in front of him.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.286
Lively, now.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.463
Found 'em on the bank.
Good condition.

34:49.505 --> 34:52.132
Worth a guilder apiece,
at least.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.842
Two guilders for the lot,
take or leave.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.724
- Excuse me, miss.
- Beg your pardon, ma'am.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.741
Tourmaline!

35:20.911 --> 35:22.204
Vini!

35:23.622 --> 35:26.041
How'd you find me?

35:26.083 --> 35:29.336
I paid one of the deckhands
to track you down for me.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.380
Spent the last of my money
from sparrowhawking.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.883
Only to find out
your oldest friend was a whore.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.886
- We all do what we have to do
- Says the one who spent her days

35:37.928 --> 35:39.888
helping refugees escape
the Pact.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.890
I think you mean
selling refugees

35:41.932 --> 35:44.226
into indentured servitude.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.812
Please. It wasn't heroism.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.856
It was a job. Got paid.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.440
Same as you.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.527
Right. But that's
not why you did it.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.737
Oh. And why'd I do it?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.698
Because people needed help,

35:57.739 --> 36:00.868
and that was the help
you could give.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.620
I've known you long enough
to know you never give up.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.874
And yet, here I am.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.795
Things must be bad, eh?

36:11.837 --> 36:14.506
Can't imagine
you'd ever leave Tirnanoc.

36:16.592 --> 36:18.594
I didn't plan to.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.223
I got word that a group
was hiding out in the woods,

36:23.265 --> 36:26.226
waiting for a boat out.

36:26.268 --> 36:29.438
Heard they'd escaped
from a camp of some kind.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.651
All women and girls.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.447
Little girls.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.700
The Pact was after them,

36:41.742 --> 36:43.952
and I tried to help, but...

36:45.579 --> 36:47.623
...they killed them all.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.753
Every single one of them.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.757
The brigade...

36:56.798 --> 36:59.176
there were so many of them, I...

36:59.217 --> 37:01.595
I knew I'd never
make it back, so...

37:01.637 --> 37:03.639
I made for the ship.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.475
Their ship.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.144
The one that
I'd arranged for them.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.649
That they never lived to see.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.986
But you're here now.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.113
Mm-hmm.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.169
Is this a widow's braid?

37:34.211 --> 37:35.796
Mm-hmm.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.549
Gods, you don't know, do you?

37:39.591 --> 37:41.385
Know what?

37:43.637 --> 37:45.931
Vignette...

37:49.101 --> 37:51.478
Philo's alive.

37:54.564 --> 37:58.652
And you think Sergeant Dombey
is this, uh...

37:58.694 --> 38:00.862
- what do you call him?
- Unseelie Jack.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.280
Unseelie?

38:02.322 --> 38:04.491
It means "hateful"
in their tongue.

38:04.533 --> 38:07.244
I can't rule Dombey out, sir.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.097
And this has nothing to do
with your own personal distaste

38:09.121 --> 38:11.707
- for the sergeant's politics?
- Only insofar as his politics

38:11.748 --> 38:14.167
align with
Unseelie Jack's politics.

38:14.209 --> 38:18.296
And that he fits the description
offered by the latest victim...

38:18.338 --> 38:21.341
down to the fact
that he wears a uniform.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.218
Even so,
you can't just go around

38:23.260 --> 38:24.886
assaulting your colleagues.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.556
The men in this building
are not your enemies.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.934
I am not in the business
of deciding who my enemies are.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.519
Neither are they.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.271
Justice is justice.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.898
- When was your last day off?
- I don't need a day off.

38:36.940 --> 38:40.110
- What's the hurry on this?
- What's the fuckin' hurry?

38:41.862 --> 38:43.881
Sir, every three weeks this
lunatic brings down his hammer.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.992
- Any day now...
- Any day now there's gonna be a dead lixer fiend.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.494
Or an aborted half-blood
or a Black Raven

38:49.536 --> 38:52.039
who caught the sharp end
of a knife fight.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.374
The Row is an ugly place.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.685
These are not criminals
or cutthroats.

38:55.709 --> 38:56.918
The last victim was a maid.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.378
The one before that
was a fisherman.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.714
Well, you can't
save them all, Philo.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.174
Damn it, I can save one!

39:02.215 --> 39:04.176
Just let me put a man on Dombey.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.386
Absolutely not.
You want me to put surveillance

39:06.428 --> 39:08.013
on one of our own,

39:08.055 --> 39:10.932
you better come to me with more
than some fucking hunch.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.142
It's more than a hunch.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.769
Philo, go home!

39:13.810 --> 39:15.312
Get some rest.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.813
Come back fresh tomorrow.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.274
- Sir, I can...
- Philo!

39:19.316 --> 39:22.152
That wasn't a request.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.334
Hey, what'd he say?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.169
Wanted me to leave Dombey be.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.171
Said I was making it personal.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.798
What have you got?

39:44.174 --> 39:47.260
Sketch artist got back
from talking to the victim.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.179
Right.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.348
Best keep this
to ourselves, I think.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.933
Oi. Cuppins.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.227
Are we running
a naval academy now?

39:55.268 --> 39:57.187
Fucking Basilisk is in port.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.522
Basilisk?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.649
Ironclad. Long-range.
They keep them out there

40:00.690 --> 40:03.443
in that tin can for weeks
until they're half mad,

40:03.485 --> 40:05.987
then back home
to let off some steam.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.073
- Sounds like a bloody nightmare.
- It sure is.

40:08.115 --> 40:11.034
Mine. Every three weeks.
Move.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.955
Every three weeks?

40:20.001 --> 40:22.170
Jack doesn't wear
a policeman's uniform.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.797
He's a fuckin' sailor.

40:23.839 --> 40:26.341
I should've seen it sooner.

40:26.383 --> 40:27.759
You were right.

40:27.801 --> 40:29.427
They're all the same,
these Burguishmen.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.847
They come with promises,
take what we have,

40:31.888 --> 40:34.683
and when there's nothing left
to take, they leave.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.810
It's a common enough story.

40:36.852 --> 40:39.521
The story of our
whole fuckin' country.

40:39.563 --> 40:40.939
So we move on.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.441
We tell a new story,
a better one.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.860
No.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.866
No. Not yet.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.325
Vignette, listen.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.053
Just calm down, take a minute
and listen to me.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.370
I'm not done with him.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.539
He will know
what he's done to me.

40:57.581 --> 41:00.125
He will look in my eyes
and know.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.880
Fuck.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.807
A carriage.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.893
A fine one.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.104
It's him.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.398
- It must be.
- Is everything all right?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.358
Our new neighbor.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.777
- Shall we be the first to welcome him?
- Imogen!

41:27.819 --> 41:30.488
What?
It's the friendly thing to do.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.741
- It's not proper.
- Ah, don't be so old-fashioned.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.243
This is the seventh century.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.997
Imogen.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.457
Oh, you're coming after all?

41:40.498 --> 41:44.169
Well, somebody had to stop you
making a spectacle of yourself.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.345
May I help you?

41:53.386 --> 41:54.554
Good afternoon, sir.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.389
Is the master of the house
at home?

41:56.431 --> 41:57.641
Whom may I say is calling?

41:57.682 --> 41:59.243
- It's Ezra...
- Ezra Spurnrose and his sister.

41:59.267 --> 42:03.271
We're neighbors, come to extend
our hospitality.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.859
Show them in, Fergus.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.988
Thank you.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.968
Spurnrose.

42:33.009 --> 42:36.680
I hear your father was the
finest watchmaker in the Burgue.

42:38.098 --> 42:40.558
We'd like to think so, yes.

42:42.727 --> 42:45.021
Is the master of the house
available?

42:45.063 --> 42:47.649
I'm master here.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.866
I shouldn't have said anything.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.828
She survived seven years
in Pact-occupied Tirnanoc.

42:59.869 --> 43:02.122
I'm sure she can survive
a night in the Burgue.

43:02.163 --> 43:03.581
Yeah, I'm sure she can too.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.667
I'm not sure about the bloke
she's mad at.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.841
Well, that's not the kid again,
is it?

43:12.882 --> 43:15.010
Second time this week.

43:15.051 --> 43:16.678
The chancellor's own kin,

43:16.720 --> 43:18.572
just waltzing in the front door
of a faerie brothel

43:18.596 --> 43:21.558
like he's never heard
of trouble.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.560
There goes my night.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.981
Mmm.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.774
Fine, I'll throw my hat in.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.401
- Really? You sure?
- Yes, yes.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.903
Why not?
I could use a distraction.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.000
Jonah.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.170
Welcome back, sir.

43:50.211 --> 43:53.381
Hello, Moira, dear.

43:53.423 --> 43:56.718
What kind of company are you
in the mood for this evening?

44:06.895 --> 44:08.521
Fleury.

45:03.827 --> 45:05.787
I got to piss.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.188
Any luck on the waterfront?

45:32.230 --> 45:34.023
I showed the sketch
to the boatswain.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.317
If he knew the face,
he wasn't saying.

45:36.359 --> 45:38.236
I was afraid of that.

45:38.278 --> 45:39.988
So what we doing here, then?

45:40.029 --> 45:42.115
Like they say,

45:42.157 --> 45:46.077
if the fish you're looking
to catch isn't in the sea...

45:47.120 --> 45:49.289
...look in the tank.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.709
These lads aren't gonna give up
one of their own so easy.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.170
Not gonna ask 'em to.

45:57.755 --> 46:01.509
All the victims were struck
on the right side of the head.

46:01.551 --> 46:04.762
Which means
our man was left-handed.

46:06.431 --> 46:11.102
His last victim said
he had a tattoo on his forearm.

46:11.144 --> 46:13.480
You want to ask 'em
to roll up their sleeves?

46:13.521 --> 46:15.190
After a fashion.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.616
...fucking told you,
that cunt.

46:24.657 --> 46:26.284
He's a fucking prick.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.666
Oi! Where you goin' with that?

46:36.419 --> 46:37.420
See you back there.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.174
'Scuse me.

46:41.216 --> 46:42.842
Ow! Sorry, mate.

46:42.884 --> 46:44.636
- Oh, what a...
- For fuck's sake!

46:44.677 --> 46:47.597
Oh, fucking hell.

47:01.528 --> 47:03.404
Fuck.

47:04.781 --> 47:06.616
Inspector!

47:06.658 --> 47:08.451
It's him! It's Jack!

47:08.493 --> 47:10.620
Go around!

48:56.601 --> 48:58.311
Show me your hands!

48:58.353 --> 49:00.146
It's done!

49:00.188 --> 49:01.188
Done?

49:03.024 --> 49:05.234
It's just beginning.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.321
I had to stop 'em.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.823
I had to.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.533
You don't know
the evil they've been about

49:12.575 --> 49:14.035
right under your nose.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.037
Step away from the ledge.

49:16.079 --> 49:19.749
They're not our god's children.

49:19.791 --> 49:22.251
They come from a dark place.

49:22.293 --> 49:23.711
And they haven't come alone.

49:23.753 --> 49:25.713
They've brought something
with them.

49:25.755 --> 49:28.716
Something
that will be the end of us.

49:28.758 --> 49:30.385
I've seen it.

49:30.426 --> 49:32.804
With my own eyes.

49:34.514 --> 49:37.975
You think I'm mad.

49:38.017 --> 49:41.396
I know darkness.

49:41.437 --> 49:43.648
I've been to the twilight edge
of the world

49:43.690 --> 49:45.400
and dredged up things
from the sunless deep

49:45.441 --> 49:47.318
that would turn your blood cold.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.320
But nothing

49:49.362 --> 49:53.908
like the thing I saw in the dark
beneath our very feet.

49:56.202 --> 50:00.623
You're ill-prepared for
the hardship that lies ahead.

50:00.665 --> 50:04.252
There is more here
than you can fathom.

50:06.045 --> 50:09.424
And while you go about
your little life,

50:09.465 --> 50:12.885
so sure that this world
still belongs to you...

50:15.471 --> 50:19.267
...some dark god wakes.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.326
Needless to say,

50:37.368 --> 50:39.162
we couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

50:39.203 --> 50:40.913
Imagine it.

50:40.955 --> 50:42.790
A Puck living here.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.293
On Finistere Crossing.

50:45.334 --> 50:48.588
What is the city coming to?

50:48.629 --> 50:51.048
My robe.

50:54.761 --> 50:57.054
Mm, that'll be all, Vignette.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.265
I'll take tea in my room here
at 7:00.

51:03.811 --> 51:06.189
Good night, miss.

52:40.825 --> 52:43.202
Mmm.

52:43.244 --> 52:45.830
Mr. Philostrate.

52:45.872 --> 52:46.890
What are you doing in here?

52:46.914 --> 52:48.249
Oh, is this no longer my room?

52:48.291 --> 52:50.501
I thought I'd surprise you.

52:50.543 --> 52:52.503
For your birthday.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.755
Well, it's not my birthday.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.799
You moved in a year ago,

52:56.841 --> 53:00.678
so I figured I must have missed
at least one by now.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.680
What happened to your hand?

53:02.722 --> 53:04.849
And your head.

53:04.891 --> 53:06.225
Philo.

53:06.267 --> 53:07.518
Someone threw a hammer at me.

53:07.560 --> 53:08.579
You know how it goes.

53:08.603 --> 53:10.521
What? Let me see?

53:10.563 --> 53:12.315
You should get that looked at.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.959
- There's no need.
- You might need stitches.

53:13.983 --> 53:16.003
- No, it's fine. No doctors.
- You could have a concussion.

53:16.027 --> 53:18.738
I said...

53:18.779 --> 53:21.699
no doctors.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.501
I'm sorry.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.420
It's been a night.

53:34.462 --> 53:36.839
I just have a lot on my mind.

53:36.881 --> 53:39.175
You can talk about it.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.010
You know that, right?

53:41.052 --> 53:43.012
It's not unheard of,

53:43.054 --> 53:46.182
for people who share a bed to
share some thoughts on occasion.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.725
Another time, maybe.

53:47.767 --> 53:49.769
- Don't do that.
- What?

53:49.810 --> 53:52.104
"Another time, maybe."

53:54.523 --> 53:57.485
Look, I don't want to burden you
with these things, Portia.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.487
It's no burden.

53:59.528 --> 54:01.364
You don't know the weight of it.

54:01.405 --> 54:02.990
I don't.

54:03.032 --> 54:04.700
But I know you carry it alone,

54:04.742 --> 54:07.787
and you don't have to.

54:07.828 --> 54:11.540
I want to know you, Philo.

54:13.084 --> 54:15.211
And I'm telling you

54:15.252 --> 54:18.422
you may just be happier
in the dark.

54:20.508 --> 54:22.885
I see.

54:25.388 --> 54:27.181
Yes.

54:27.223 --> 54:28.599
Right.

54:28.641 --> 54:30.685
I keep forgetting what this is.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.454
- I didn't mean to...
- No, you're just looking out for me.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.188
Thank you for that.

54:34.230 --> 54:36.399
Just carry on
and let me know the next time

54:36.440 --> 54:38.234
you fancy a quick fuck.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.568
Portia...

54:39.610 --> 54:41.821
Good night, Mr. Philostrate.

55:05.678 --> 55:07.638
You lying shit.

55:09.682 --> 55:11.517
You're alive.

55:13.019 --> 55:16.814
Mima Roosan came to me
with blood on her hands.

55:16.856 --> 55:20.192
She said you died in her arms.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.863
Why did she lie to me?

55:27.241 --> 55:29.577
Because I told her to.

55:31.829 --> 55:33.205
We...

55:33.247 --> 55:36.625
we told each other everything.

55:36.667 --> 55:40.546
Couldn't you have
at least told me good-bye?

55:40.588 --> 55:42.548
I wanted to.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.928
I never meant to hurt you.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.722
Hurt me?

55:52.433 --> 55:55.811
You destroyed me.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.898
I waited for you,

55:58.939 --> 56:01.734
and you left me
in the ashes of my homeland

56:01.776 --> 56:05.946
with nothing but grief
for seven years.

56:16.248 --> 56:18.834
I should've done this
the day we met.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.465
Do it.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.968
Do it.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.982
You're not worth it.

56:48.531 --> 56:51.075
I wish you had died.

58:19.747 --> 58:22.791
There's more
here than you can fathom.

58:22.833 --> 58:25.544
And while you go about
your little life,

58:25.586 --> 58:28.589
so sure that this world
still belongs to you,

58:28.631 --> 58:31.634
some dark god wakes.
