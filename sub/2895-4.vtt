WEBVTT

00:00.061 --> 00:01.211
Previously on Suits...

00:01.263 --> 00:03.455
Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

00:03.455 --> 00:06.841
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

00:06.908 --> 00:08.828
Well, you told me that
Mike Ross wasn't a threat,

00:08.844 --> 00:10.364
and then he handcuffed us
with a T.R.O.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.463
I want proof that
he's giving up his bid,

00:12.547 --> 00:13.881
and if I don't get it
by the morning,

00:13.932 --> 00:15.549
I'm gonna call
my private investigators,

00:15.600 --> 00:16.550
and I'm gonna finish
what I started.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.185
What did Harvey tell you?

00:18.253 --> 00:19.653
Looks like
he told me the truth.

00:19.721 --> 00:21.021
We're done.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.274
I want you to stop
the personal attacks on Mike.

00:23.358 --> 00:25.038
You told me this
wasn't gonna be a problem.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.479
You don't have to stop this
because you're some changed man.

00:28.563 --> 00:30.564
You have to stop this
because you owe me.

00:30.632 --> 00:31.632
Mr. Ross.

00:31.633 --> 00:32.566
Eric Woodall.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.034
I'm the U.S. attorney for--

00:34.102 --> 00:35.453
The southern district
of New York.

00:35.537 --> 00:36.620
I know who you are.

00:36.705 --> 00:38.289
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around

00:38.373 --> 00:40.875
intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

00:40.942 --> 00:42.076
They don't,
but they will

00:42.127 --> 00:43.728
when Eric Woodall starts there
next week.

00:43.745 --> 00:44.745
It started.

00:44.746 --> 00:47.548
Seven clients, seven subpoenas,

00:47.615 --> 00:49.133
all coming tomorrow.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.486 --> 01:09.653
Uh, excuse me,
you don't have an appointment.

01:09.738 --> 01:10.804
I don't need an appointment.

01:10.856 --> 01:12.573
Sit down, shut up,
and listen.

01:12.641 --> 01:15.459
Harvey might forgive you because
you returned those recordings,

01:15.544 --> 01:16.427
but I don't.

01:16.511 --> 01:17.761
- Donna.
- Not done.

01:17.846 --> 01:19.980
What Harvey did with Gillis,
it was harsh,

01:20.048 --> 01:22.900
but using what I told you
in a private conversation--

01:22.984 --> 01:25.052
that crosses a line
that even Harvey never would.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.787
- Donna.
- Still not done.

01:26.838 --> 01:29.857
When you left our firm,
you left me too,

01:29.924 --> 01:32.359
but I honestly thought
that we'd always be friends.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.362
Now I'm not so sure.

01:35.413 --> 01:37.264
Amy, did you send Donna
the package?

01:37.332 --> 01:38.832
Guilt gift.
Didn't open it.

01:38.884 --> 01:41.135
It was a balenciaga
classic town bag.

01:41.203 --> 01:42.203
Ivory?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.591
Anthracite
with an outside pocket.

01:43.622 --> 01:44.655
His idea or yours?

01:44.739 --> 01:45.956
Don't answer that.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.343
It was yours.

01:49.411 --> 01:50.578
I'm sorry, Donna.

01:50.645 --> 01:52.279
You and Harvey want to
knock each other out,

01:52.347 --> 01:54.281
you go right ahead.

01:54.349 --> 01:56.450
But don't ever
betray me again.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.037
Nice shoes.

02:04.009 --> 02:05.459
She's even better
than I imagined.

02:17.906 --> 02:20.824
Looking for this?

02:20.909 --> 02:23.194
Harvey Specter.

02:23.278 --> 02:25.696
What brings you to Montclair
at 7:00 in the morning?

02:25.780 --> 02:27.614
Oh, you know
what brings me here.

02:27.666 --> 02:30.417
I woke up to find these
on my welcome mat.

02:30.485 --> 02:33.020
Well, as much as I'd love
to have been responsible

02:33.071 --> 02:36.156
for subpoenaing seven
of your firm's top clients,

02:36.208 --> 02:38.425
I didn't even know about this
till just now.

02:38.493 --> 02:40.613
You didn't even have the balls
to come at me directly.

02:40.629 --> 02:42.263
Get off my property.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.514
What's the matter, Eric?

02:43.598 --> 02:46.116
You're afraid
I'll get you fired again?

02:46.201 --> 02:48.101
I get it.

02:48.153 --> 02:50.871
You want to hear me say
I'm using my new position

02:50.922 --> 02:52.739
to destroy your business,

02:52.791 --> 02:55.259
'cause you're the piece
of garbage that got me fired.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.810
Isn't that what you
want to hear me say?

02:56.878 --> 02:59.313
Oh, I know
you'll never say that,

02:59.364 --> 03:01.031
but I do want you to admit
that you sent

03:01.116 --> 03:03.117
an agent Brian Harris
after my firm.

03:03.168 --> 03:05.002
Sorry.
I don't even have jurisdiction

03:05.086 --> 03:06.520
over that department.

03:06.588 --> 03:09.173
That department's run by a man
name Sean Cahill.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.457
So all on his own,

03:10.508 --> 03:13.010
Sean Cahill just happened
to target my firm?

03:13.094 --> 03:15.095
Well, he is a killer attorney

03:15.163 --> 03:17.948
with a nose for sleazy lawyers,

03:18.033 --> 03:19.266
and I should know.

03:19.317 --> 03:21.201
We came up together
at the Justice Department.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.404
You know, that little
governmental agency

03:23.455 --> 03:24.822
that protects their own?

03:24.906 --> 03:26.874
Well, Eric, your big brother
couldn't protect you

03:26.941 --> 03:28.208
from getting fired before,

03:28.276 --> 03:30.878
and I don't see how this is
gonna be any different,

03:30.945 --> 03:34.048
and by the way,
that's yesterday's paper.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.084
You wanted to see me?

03:37.135 --> 03:38.135
Sure did.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.287
Have a seat.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.289
I was going over
our trade sheets.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.974
Couldn't help but notice

03:44.059 --> 03:46.260
you bought another 100,000
shares of Gillis Industries.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.478
It's gonna be fine.

03:47.562 --> 03:49.179
Do I look like an asshole
to you?

03:49.264 --> 03:50.630
Where the hell
did you get the money?

03:50.682 --> 03:53.100
You know where
I got the money.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.485
I bought those shares on margin.

03:54.569 --> 03:55.569
And leveraged my company.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.654
The bylaws said I can do it.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.238
I don't care
what the bylaws say,

03:58.306 --> 03:59.857
you did this without asking.

03:59.941 --> 04:01.022
Look, I know you're pissed.

04:01.026 --> 04:02.026
Oh, I'm not pissed.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.577
I've been waiting for you

04:03.644 --> 04:05.245
to have the balls
to do something like this

04:05.313 --> 04:06.313
since you got here.

04:06.331 --> 04:07.831
You raised my risk,

04:07.916 --> 04:09.796
but you also raised my reward,
and on top of it,

04:09.817 --> 04:12.419
you did it like
an investment banker,

04:12.487 --> 04:14.121
without permission.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.959
Well, thank you, Jon.

04:20.011 --> 04:22.379
Go get 'em.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.050
One more thing.
Yeah?

04:26.134 --> 04:28.769
You have a week
to de-leverage my company.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.938
If you don't,
you're out of a job.

04:34.976 --> 04:36.176
You want to explain to me why

04:36.227 --> 04:38.028
you went to Eric Woodall's house
this morning?

04:38.063 --> 04:39.530
I understand
you're bent out of shape

04:39.614 --> 04:41.065
because I stepped on
your territory--

04:41.149 --> 04:42.950
You think I give a shit
about my territory?

04:43.017 --> 04:44.417
What the hell are you doing
in here?

04:44.486 --> 04:45.567
Listen, I really don't care

04:45.570 --> 04:47.071
if you work this thing
or I do,

04:47.155 --> 04:49.206
but whoever it is has to
not be an idiot.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.991
And how, exactly,
am I an idiot?

04:51.042 --> 04:53.494
- You poked the bear.
- Eric Woodall isn't the bear.

04:53.545 --> 04:55.379
No. I am.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.365
And whatever you were
about to say, don't say it.

04:58.416 --> 05:00.667
Harvey, this is his case.

05:00.719 --> 05:02.052
It's why we brought him in,

05:02.137 --> 05:03.337
and I don't want you involved.

05:03.388 --> 05:04.388
Me?

05:04.389 --> 05:05.506
I'm the one who found out

05:05.557 --> 05:06.706
it's not Woodall
coming after us, it's--

05:06.758 --> 05:08.425
Sean Cahill.

05:08.510 --> 05:09.810
You think I didn't know that?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.262
These are my clients,
and when they call in a panic,

05:12.347 --> 05:14.264
I need to be the voice
on the other end of the line.

05:14.349 --> 05:16.550
Then be the voice
on the other end of the line,

05:16.618 --> 05:18.318
but you're not
handling the S.E.C.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.154
I'm the reason
they're coming after us.

05:20.221 --> 05:22.322
Which is why you wanted to
hire Jeff in the first place.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.108
That was before
all this became real.

05:24.192 --> 05:25.359
Now that it's happening,

05:25.410 --> 05:26.560
he doesn't want to
sit on the sidelines.

05:26.611 --> 05:27.995
Damn right I don't.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.197
Well, then find yourself
a comfortable spot on the bench,

05:30.248 --> 05:32.533
because like it or not,
Jeff's in charge.

So it go just like
you said it would?

06:11.522 --> 06:12.823
Exactly, except for the part

06:12.890 --> 06:14.574
where if I don't find
a new investor in a week,

06:14.659 --> 06:15.776
I'm out of a job.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.444
I'm surprised
he gave you a week.

06:17.528 --> 06:19.613
- Amy, it's not funny.
- I know it isn't.

06:19.697 --> 06:22.232
I was just trying to make
the best of the situation.

06:22.283 --> 06:24.234
Well, if you want to make
the best of the situation,

06:24.285 --> 06:25.952
get me a meeting
with Tony Gianopolous,

06:26.037 --> 06:29.372
because if I can't get
in there...

06:29.424 --> 06:30.590
I'm in trouble.

06:30.675 --> 06:32.759
We're in trouble.

06:32.844 --> 06:34.544
You really mean that?

06:34.595 --> 06:38.298
You think I'm staying here
if you leave?

06:38.382 --> 06:39.599
Thank you, Amy.

06:39.684 --> 06:40.851
I'm just kidding.

06:40.918 --> 06:42.198
Epstein's been trying
to poach me

06:42.253 --> 06:43.804
since the day I got here.
Mmm. Tch.

06:43.888 --> 06:45.806
Yeah, you think those flowers
bought themselves?

06:45.890 --> 06:47.607
Mm-mm.

06:47.692 --> 06:50.811
You--wow.

06:56.868 --> 06:58.635
Can I talk to you a second?

06:58.703 --> 07:00.570
If you want an update
on the takeover,

07:00.638 --> 07:02.272
you should talk to Harvey.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.591
That's not why I'm here.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.226
Look, Logan,
I-I know that you--

07:06.310 --> 07:08.829
I have five companies here

07:08.913 --> 07:10.380
that I'm looking at
for my next deal,

07:10.448 --> 07:12.482
and I need someone
to evaluate them

07:12.550 --> 07:15.352
from a legal standpoint.

07:15.419 --> 07:17.888
- Your next deal.
- Yeah, my next deal.

07:17.955 --> 07:20.356
Harvey told me
not to hurt my future

07:20.408 --> 07:21.758
by going below the belt
with Mike,

07:21.825 --> 07:23.225
so instead of not
hurting my future,

07:23.261 --> 07:25.028
I thought I'd start
planning for it.

07:25.096 --> 07:27.864
So then maybe Harvey is who
you should be planning it with.

07:27.932 --> 07:29.566
Well, Harvey's
got stuff to do,

07:29.634 --> 07:31.795
and he's not the one who
convinced me to back off Mike.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.887
Are you saying that I owe you?

07:33.971 --> 07:35.038
No, I'm not saying that,

07:35.106 --> 07:36.473
but that is what you said to me.

07:36.541 --> 07:38.742
So we're just gonna go
back and forth, trading favors?

07:38.809 --> 07:40.076
Rachel, this isn't a favor.

07:40.144 --> 07:41.795
I have a board meeting
on Friday.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.163
I need to be prepared.

07:43.247 --> 07:45.549
So are you my lawyer or not?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.735
I will get right on it.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.737
Thank you.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.660
Louis, I need your help.
We're gonna need to--

07:56.727 --> 07:57.894
Don't speak.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.899
You may speak.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.000
What were you doing?

08:04.068 --> 08:07.037
Just thanking
the lord God almighty.

08:07.104 --> 08:08.838
We taking down Jessica?
We firing Malone?

08:08.906 --> 08:09.906
I am tingling.

08:09.974 --> 08:11.241
What, Harvey?
Just tell me what.

08:11.309 --> 08:14.211
Mike Ross just bought another
2% of Gillis Industries.

08:14.278 --> 08:16.213
He must be leveraged up
to his scrawny little neck.

08:16.264 --> 08:18.381
Exactly, and he's gonna be
scrambling for funding.

08:18.449 --> 08:20.400
You want me
to get your T.R.O. removed.

08:20.484 --> 08:21.484
How do you know that?

08:21.552 --> 08:23.453
Because you pissed off
judge Ramos

08:23.520 --> 08:24.821
and now she
can't stand you.

08:24.889 --> 08:26.006
How do you know that?

08:26.090 --> 08:27.257
Oh, because I keep
a list of your enemies.

08:27.308 --> 08:28.558
You want to see it?
Just get it done.

08:28.626 --> 08:29.693
Oh, I'm gonna get it done.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.361
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.895
Louis, we're splitting
Mike's focus.

08:32.964 --> 08:34.764
That doesn't mean
he won't be prepared.

08:34.832 --> 08:36.072
Oh, he can prepare
all he wants,

08:36.133 --> 08:38.368
but the student is about to meet
the master,

08:38.419 --> 08:40.386
because Ralph Macchio
doesn't stand a chance

08:40.471 --> 08:42.005
against Mr. Miyagi.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.908
You know <i>The Karate Kid?</i>

08:52.750 --> 08:54.034
That's not cool, Harvey.

08:57.088 --> 09:00.290
Oh, let me see
if I can guess why you're here.

09:00.341 --> 09:02.092
You came to tell me
the way I handled Harvey

09:02.159 --> 09:04.644
this morning was sexy.

09:04.729 --> 09:06.630
Oh, you mean when I told him
to leave you alone?

09:06.697 --> 09:10.533
And the way that I allowed you
to do that was very sexy.

09:10.585 --> 09:12.302
Uh-huh.

09:12.369 --> 09:14.771
And this is...

09:14.838 --> 09:16.473
The Griffen Cosmetics
subpoena.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.557
I looked them all over.

09:17.642 --> 09:18.775
This is the weakest one.

09:18.843 --> 09:20.777
- The weakest one?
- Exactly.

09:20.845 --> 09:23.830
Once this one goes down,
the others fall like dominos.

09:23.914 --> 09:25.882
First of all, if I were gonna
take that strategy,

09:25.950 --> 09:27.350
I would go for
the hardest one.

09:27.418 --> 09:29.102
Second of all,
why don't you walk yourself

09:29.186 --> 09:30.854
back to your office
and let me do my job?

09:30.921 --> 09:33.089
Excuse me?

09:33.157 --> 09:36.710
You told Harvey you
brought me in to handle this.

09:36.794 --> 09:40.663
Your job isn't to worry about
what I told Harvey.

09:40.715 --> 09:43.466
Your job is to worry about
what I'm telling you.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.135
And what I'm telling you

09:45.186 --> 09:47.604
is that I'm not walking
into an S.E.C. negotiation

09:47.655 --> 09:48.571
with a babysitter.

09:48.639 --> 09:50.106
Negotiation?

09:50.157 --> 09:51.491
This is going to be a war.

09:51.575 --> 09:53.710
I know that, and I'm gonna
win it with one shot.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.211
Then I suggest you
warm up to this.

09:55.279 --> 09:58.131
You're not walking into
the S.E.C. with a babysitter.

09:58.215 --> 10:01.084
You're walking in there
with a bazooka.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.472
Hey, Mike,
you need to see something.

10:05.556 --> 10:07.290
No, I don't have time.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.958
I'm working on
the Gianopolous proposal.

10:09.010 --> 10:11.227
Yeah, that proposal isn't
gonna matter if they win this.

10:17.134 --> 10:19.519
Goddamn it.

10:19.603 --> 10:21.271
Harvey's trying to roll back
the T.R.O.?

10:21.322 --> 10:22.322
No, it's not Harvey.

10:22.323 --> 10:23.323
Check the docket.

10:23.324 --> 10:26.476
It's some woman named Lois Litt.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.581
Yeah.

10:31.648 --> 10:32.648
I know how to handle her.

10:32.649 --> 10:34.117
Um, here.

10:34.168 --> 10:35.651
This is 90% done.
Check it over.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.653
Make sure there's not
one comma out of place.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.822
Mike, come on,
you know I can do more than--

10:39.874 --> 10:41.458
- I don't have time, Amy.
Just do it.

10:41.509 --> 10:43.009
Okay.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.264
How long did you work
in this shit hole?

10:48.332 --> 10:50.934
Sorry I'm late.
Been up to my neck in work.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.019
Just filed seven huge subpoenas.

10:53.104 --> 10:54.437
- Yeah, we know what you filed.
- Oh.

10:54.505 --> 10:55.938
I see you brought the missus.

10:55.990 --> 10:59.743
Jessica, whatever you're
about to say, don't say it.

10:59.794 --> 11:01.778
How about I say it with this?

11:01.846 --> 11:03.079
Ooh, a subpoena?

11:04.148 --> 11:05.381
Smells fresh.
It is.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.193
And you'll be answering it
in court tomorrow.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.518
Oh, well then I better see

11:08.569 --> 11:11.538
what flavor bullshit
you're serving up.

11:13.574 --> 11:15.158
Ah, ah, now,
this is a good one.

11:15.226 --> 11:19.562
"Malicious prosecution
of Pearson Specter clients,"

11:19.630 --> 11:20.951
and how exactly
are we doing that?

11:20.981 --> 11:21.981
I'll tell you how.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.299
You come at our clients.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.651
Our clients leave us.

11:24.735 --> 11:25.952
You drop their cases.

11:26.036 --> 11:27.487
Well, I certainly
wouldn't tell them

11:27.571 --> 11:29.205
that's how to avoid
S.E.C. scrutiny,

11:29.273 --> 11:32.542
but it's not my fault
if dropping Pearson Specter

11:32.570 --> 11:33.570
starts catching on.

11:33.594 --> 11:34.594
Enough bullshit.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.262
You're targeting my clients

11:36.347 --> 11:38.414
on behalf of Eric Woodall,
and you know it.

11:38.466 --> 11:40.300
That is a lovely theory,
but if you had any proof,

11:40.384 --> 11:41.945
you wouldn't be standing here
right now.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.820
I have proof, Sean.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.054
I have proof you filed

11:45.106 --> 11:46.689
seven cases in one day
against our clients,

11:46.741 --> 11:48.181
which we both know
has never happened

11:48.225 --> 11:49.692
in the history of the S.E.C.

11:49.744 --> 11:51.111
It has now.

11:51.195 --> 11:53.997
We've filed nine cases
against clients of Weil Gotshal,

11:54.064 --> 11:55.165
eight against Skaaden,

11:55.232 --> 11:57.751
and six against Cravath.

11:57.835 --> 11:59.586
Welcome to the new S.E.C.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.287
We target law firms.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.289
And as long as we're not
only targeting yours,

12:03.374 --> 12:06.042
the only way to shut this down
is to shut us down.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.127
You and I both know

12:07.211 --> 12:09.745
what's really
going on here, Sean,

12:09.797 --> 12:10.913
and I'm gonna prove it.

12:10.965 --> 12:12.849
Well, good luck,
but how do you think

12:12.916 --> 12:15.218
judge Hopkins is gonna respond
to your allegations

12:15.269 --> 12:16.770
when I tell him
they're coming from a man

12:16.854 --> 12:20.723
who is about to be fired?

12:20.775 --> 12:22.759
Oh, you--
you didn't tell her.

12:22.827 --> 12:26.229
Ooh, that's awkward.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.647
I'll see you in court.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.118
- Jessica!
- I don't want to hear it.

12:32.203 --> 12:33.903
- Well, you need to hear it.
- What?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.321
That you lied to me?

12:35.406 --> 12:36.939
You know, I didn't
actually lie to you.

12:36.991 --> 12:38.941
Oh, no, no, no.
You tell me that you didn't lie

12:38.993 --> 12:40.794
because we never directly
asked you the question,

12:40.878 --> 12:42.078
and I will knock
your head off.

12:42.079 --> 12:43.079
All right, fine.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.330
I lied.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.948
I lied
because it doesn't matter.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.168
I want to fight for you,
and I'm the best man to do it.

12:48.252 --> 12:49.969
Well, the new part
of the equation

12:50.054 --> 12:51.888
is that you just made me
look like a fool.

12:51.955 --> 12:53.316
- Jess.
- Don't pull that Jess shit

12:53.340 --> 12:55.058
with me--I want to know what
it says in your file.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.260
- I don't know what it says.
- How the hell do you not know?

12:57.311 --> 12:58.461
'Cause whatever it is
is bullshit.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.430
Because the reason
they were gonna fire me

13:00.481 --> 13:01.898
is that I refused
to go after you.

13:01.965 --> 13:04.517
Then why didn't you
tell me that

13:04.602 --> 13:06.319
when you came at us
demanding a job?

13:06.403 --> 13:08.271
Because good lawyers negotiate

13:08.322 --> 13:11.574
from a position of strength,
not weakness.

13:11.642 --> 13:14.160
Well, the position
you just put us in

13:14.245 --> 13:15.945
is pretty goddamn weak.

13:24.669 --> 13:26.145
Oh well if it isn't
the boy wonder.

13:26.145 --> 13:28.046
- Louis, hey.
- Don't Louis me.

13:28.113 --> 13:29.434
You left without even
the courtesy

13:29.481 --> 13:31.816
of a "how's your father?"
What does that mean?

13:31.883 --> 13:34.374
It means that I'm not here
to exchange pleasantries.

13:34.374 --> 13:35.958
I'm here to get
that T.R.O. lifted.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.126
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

13:37.193 --> 13:38.927
I'm also sorry
to hear about Sheila.

13:38.978 --> 13:41.146
Bullshit you're sorry
to hear about she--

13:41.231 --> 13:42.297
what are you
talking about?

13:42.365 --> 13:43.605
Come on,
you have to have heard.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.117
Heard what?

13:45.201 --> 13:46.969
She's engaged.

13:47.036 --> 13:49.104
It's all over Harvard's
Facebook page.

13:55.022 --> 13:56.522
Oh, my God,
how could she do this?

13:56.522 --> 13:58.957
She said she could never be
attracted to a handsome man.

13:59.024 --> 14:00.858
And that picture doesn't
even do him justice,

14:00.926 --> 14:01.809
but this one, however...

14:01.894 --> 14:03.478
- A thong?
- Yeah.

14:03.562 --> 14:05.613
That...
What the-

14:05.698 --> 14:08.299
Yeah, it's a whole, like,
beach thing, I guess.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.668
Long weekend.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.536
You're a son of a bitch, Mike.

14:12.588 --> 14:13.748
You're not even sorry at all.

14:13.806 --> 14:15.139
You're using this
to get into my head.

14:15.207 --> 14:16.607
Louis, come on,
I can't believe you.

14:16.675 --> 14:18.276
You think I would use
Sheila's engagement

14:18.344 --> 14:19.504
just to get you
off your game?

14:19.511 --> 14:20.578
Never gonna work.

14:20.646 --> 14:21.846
That I would
stick it in your face

14:21.914 --> 14:23.475
that she's all up
in this guy's business

14:23.482 --> 14:24.732
in a way that you've
never seen before?

14:24.817 --> 14:25.934
Water off a duck's back.

14:26.018 --> 14:27.735
That right now
she's probably scrapbooking

14:27.820 --> 14:29.220
the first day
of their relationship,

14:29.271 --> 14:30.738
which apparently happened
just weeks

14:30.823 --> 14:33.491
after you broke her heart?

14:33.558 --> 14:34.909
You're the devil.

14:34.994 --> 14:36.277
Next up on the docket,

14:36.362 --> 14:38.696
Sidwell Investment group
versus Sanders International.

14:38.747 --> 14:39.998
Looks like that's us.

14:40.065 --> 14:41.146
I'll see you in there.

14:44.403 --> 14:45.536
Louis, I can't believe it.

14:45.587 --> 14:47.755
I give you one
goddamn job to do,

14:47.840 --> 14:49.207
and you--
what are you doing up there?

14:49.274 --> 14:50.808
Harvey, please, I can explain.

14:50.876 --> 14:55.079
Oh, explain why you stood in
front of the judge like a moron?

14:55.130 --> 14:56.247
What possible explanation--

14:56.315 --> 14:58.983
Sheila got engaged.

14:59.051 --> 15:00.685
What?

15:00.736 --> 15:01.736
When?

15:01.754 --> 15:02.954
This morning.

15:04.206 --> 15:05.289
Louis, I'm sorry.

15:06.425 --> 15:08.092
I was so sure
that she would just come around

15:08.160 --> 15:09.627
about having children,
you know?

15:09.695 --> 15:12.063
That's why I've been
turning down

15:12.131 --> 15:13.698
all those J-date requests.

15:13.766 --> 15:15.049
We'll get Mike another way.

15:15.134 --> 15:16.894
Oh, you're goddamn right
we're gonna get him.

15:16.969 --> 15:18.102
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch

15:18.170 --> 15:19.170
if it's the last thing I do.

15:19.221 --> 15:21.072
What are you talking about?

15:21.140 --> 15:24.275
He used the Sheila news
to get into my head, Harvey.

15:24.343 --> 15:28.980
Used the news
or gave you the news?

15:29.048 --> 15:30.649
Oh, please,
what difference does it make?

15:30.699 --> 15:31.859
What difference does it make?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.451
It makes all the difference.

15:33.519 --> 15:35.086
Like on the one hand,
I feel for you,

15:35.154 --> 15:37.154
and on the other, you're
the world's biggest idiot.

15:37.172 --> 15:38.172
Look at my computer.

15:38.257 --> 15:39.390
I've been staring at it
for three hours.

15:39.418 --> 15:40.418
It's real.

15:40.442 --> 15:41.926
I don't believe it.

15:41.994 --> 15:43.611
Yeah, that adonis
on that yacht,

15:43.696 --> 15:44.862
Sheila's fiance.

15:44.913 --> 15:47.198
That adonis
is a photoshopped picture

15:47.249 --> 15:49.967
of Lorenzo Lamas from 1998!

15:50.035 --> 15:51.369
Who the hell
is Lorenzo Lamas?

15:51.437 --> 15:52.770
Well, I can tell you
who he isn't.

15:52.838 --> 15:54.806
He isn't Sheila's fiance!

16:00.212 --> 16:01.646
Oh, thank God.

16:01.714 --> 16:03.815
Are you even listening?

16:03.882 --> 16:06.117
It was bad enough
that Nigel rattled you

16:06.185 --> 16:07.685
with your unread cat letters.

16:07.753 --> 16:08.993
Now you're letting Mike
do this?

16:09.054 --> 16:11.022
- Harvey, please.
- Shut the hell up!

16:11.089 --> 16:12.557
Look, I tried to warn you,

16:12.608 --> 16:15.359
and you stood there with your
stupid leg up in the air,

16:15.411 --> 16:18.162
telling me that the student
was no match for the master

16:18.230 --> 16:22.399
and all it took
was one doctored picture

16:22.451 --> 16:23.734
for you to shit the bed!

16:23.786 --> 16:27.288
- I didn't mean to--
- Shut the hell up!

16:27.372 --> 16:28.506
God.

16:34.596 --> 16:36.798
Well, fancy meeting you here.

16:36.882 --> 16:39.583
Rachel, get out of here.

16:39.635 --> 16:43.554
I was just coming to
make some copy--

16:43.605 --> 16:44.956
Louis, what's wrong?

16:45.023 --> 16:46.924
I don't want to talk about it;
Nothing is wrong.

16:46.992 --> 16:48.676
Well, obviously
something's wrong.

16:48.761 --> 16:50.294
You know what,
if you're so curious,

16:50.345 --> 16:51.813
why don't you just go ask
the man of your dreams?

16:51.897 --> 16:54.065
I'm sure the two of you will
have a big laugh about it later.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.900
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about,

16:55.968 --> 16:57.101
but seeing you like this,

16:57.169 --> 16:58.870
there's no way
that I would laugh at you.

16:58.937 --> 17:00.071
What is it?

17:00.139 --> 17:02.240
Mike convinced me
that Sheila was engaged

17:02.307 --> 17:03.908
to throw me off my game.

17:03.975 --> 17:05.943
I'm so sorry, Louis.

17:05.993 --> 17:07.712
Yeah, well, he sure wasn't.

17:07.780 --> 17:09.547
Stuck a knife in me,
twisted it

17:09.598 --> 17:11.415
with the thought of her
and another man.

17:11.483 --> 17:14.852
It felt like
a drill in my skull all day,

17:14.920 --> 17:16.037
and then to top it all off,

17:16.121 --> 17:21.092
it cost me the respect
of my best friend.

17:22.928 --> 17:23.944
Maybe--

17:24.029 --> 17:26.396
Oh, don't you even try
to defend him.

17:26.464 --> 17:27.898
No, I wasn't going to.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.567
I was going to say,

17:29.635 --> 17:32.136
maybe this is what you needed

17:32.204 --> 17:35.139
to decide to reconnect
with Sheila.

17:35.207 --> 17:36.607
And what about Harvey?

17:36.675 --> 17:38.709
How do I repair that?

17:40.445 --> 17:42.130
I'm really sorry
for what happened, Louis.

17:42.214 --> 17:43.214
I am.

17:56.728 --> 17:58.346
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.430 --> 17:59.647
Did you eat?

17:59.731 --> 18:01.632
Are you asking because
you're concerned about me

18:01.683 --> 18:05.670
or because you want to know
if I left you any food?

18:05.737 --> 18:08.589
Whoa.

18:08.674 --> 18:10.107
Tough day?
I'm sorry.

18:10.175 --> 18:12.143
I've just been working
16-hour days,

18:12.210 --> 18:15.413
and I'm really--
stressed.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.614
Yeah, I know the feeling.

18:16.682 --> 18:17.982
Really?

18:18.050 --> 18:22.153
'Cause I heard that you had
a pretty big win today.

18:22.221 --> 18:23.221
You talked to Harvey.

18:23.222 --> 18:25.256
I talked to Louis.

18:25.307 --> 18:26.641
Mike, I know you want to win,

18:26.725 --> 18:29.527
but do you have any idea
what your lie did to him?

18:29.594 --> 18:30.594
It wasn't a lie.

18:30.646 --> 18:32.029
It was a strategy.

18:32.097 --> 18:35.233
It was both, and it ended up
with him near tears.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.601
Come on, Rachel.

18:36.668 --> 18:38.586
It just seems like all
that matters to you is winning

18:38.670 --> 18:40.838
and that you don't care about
what it does to your friends.

18:40.906 --> 18:42.723
You know what?

18:42.808 --> 18:44.559
I'm sorry that I hurt Louis,

18:44.643 --> 18:45.964
but he was going to
that courtroom

18:45.978 --> 18:47.712
so they could put their
tender offer to a vote.

18:47.779 --> 18:49.480
I know.

18:49.531 --> 18:51.999
You also know because we've
had this discussion before

18:52.084 --> 18:53.834
that if he got his way,

18:53.919 --> 18:56.520
they would rip that company
to shreds.

18:56.588 --> 18:59.173
So instead of coming down on me
for what I did to Louis,

18:59.258 --> 19:01.342
why don't you start worrying
about all the lives

19:01.426 --> 19:03.928
that Logan Sanders is
gonna destroy if that happens?

19:14.323 --> 19:15.573
You know, it's funny.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.658
You told me you didn't care
who was in charge.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.944
You just wanted whoever it was
to not be an idiot.

19:20.012 --> 19:21.879
Are you saying
that I was an idiot?

19:21.947 --> 19:23.297
I'm saying we both were.

19:23.382 --> 19:25.282
I shouldn't have gone
to Woodall,

19:25.334 --> 19:28.219
and you shouldn't have
lied to us.

19:28.286 --> 19:30.304
You don't seem pissed.

19:30.389 --> 19:33.123
I've had enough happen
already today.

19:33.175 --> 19:35.459
Besides,
lying to me was wrong,

19:35.527 --> 19:37.761
but lying to the woman
you're in a relationship with

19:37.813 --> 19:39.530
is a whole other level.

19:39.597 --> 19:41.732
When do you think
she's gonna get past it?

19:41.783 --> 19:43.868
From personal experience,
that could take a while.

19:43.935 --> 19:45.286
That's not my problem.

19:45.370 --> 19:46.704
That's yours.

19:46.771 --> 19:48.439
Then what are you doing here,
Harvey?

19:48.490 --> 19:52.276
I'm here to tell you
what you're gonna do about it.

19:52.327 --> 19:54.245
No.

19:54.296 --> 19:55.413
No way.

19:55.464 --> 19:57.114
I'm not taking the stand.

19:57.165 --> 19:58.449
Then what are you doing here?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
Because Woodall telling you
to go after our clients

20:00.552 --> 20:02.336
is how you got this job
in the first place

20:02.421 --> 20:03.838
and happens to make our case.

20:03.922 --> 20:05.339
He didn't outright tell me
to do it,

20:05.424 --> 20:06.424
and you know it.

20:06.425 --> 20:07.458
You had to find out somehow.

20:07.509 --> 20:09.093
I found out
from Brian Harris.

20:09.144 --> 20:11.679
He told me he had
this funny feeling

20:11.763 --> 20:13.130
that the day after
Woodall arrived,

20:13.181 --> 20:15.016
that I was gonna
start issuing subpoenas

20:15.100 --> 20:17.518
to Pearson Specter clients.

20:17.602 --> 20:20.971
When I asked him why,
he said, "you know why."

20:21.023 --> 20:22.463
Then you're gonna
get up on the stand

20:22.491 --> 20:24.808
and tell them that.
I can't. I have no proof.

20:24.860 --> 20:27.078
It was vague, and it's
a third party conversation.

20:27.145 --> 20:29.196
Which makes it hearsay,
and I don't give a shit.

20:29.281 --> 20:31.666
Well, I do, 'cause it opens
me up to slander at best

20:31.750 --> 20:33.250
and perjury charges at worst.

20:33.318 --> 20:34.835
Well, Jeff,
you used that story

20:34.920 --> 20:36.170
to get your ass in here.

20:36.254 --> 20:39.123
Now use it to get the job done.

20:46.347 --> 20:47.347
Amy!

20:48.712 --> 20:49.712
I thought I asked you

20:49.712 --> 20:51.646
to leave the Gianopolous
proposal on my desk.

20:51.714 --> 20:53.715
And I did,
20 minutes ago.

20:53.766 --> 20:55.083
What?
Okay.

20:55.151 --> 20:57.018
Did you proof it?
No.

20:57.086 --> 20:58.420
I thought you'd have
a better chance

20:58.471 --> 20:59.991
if the document
was riddled with typos.

21:00.022 --> 21:01.423
- This is important.
- I know it is,

21:01.490 --> 21:02.924
which is why I read it
backwards and forwards.

21:02.975 --> 21:04.292
Okay, did you add the part

21:04.360 --> 21:05.660
about the leveraged recap
like I asked?

21:05.728 --> 21:08.496
I did, but your figures
on the non-voting stock

21:08.564 --> 21:10.832
didn't add up,
so I proposed a staggered board

21:10.900 --> 21:12.334
to make up for the imbalance.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.768
Staggered board?

21:13.836 --> 21:15.203
Yeah, don't act so surprised.

21:15.271 --> 21:16.738
I'm sorry,
I just thought that you--

21:16.806 --> 21:18.526
You just thought
that I didn't know anything

21:18.557 --> 21:19.891
about what goes on here?

21:19.976 --> 21:21.192
Listen up, T. Boone Pickens,

21:21.277 --> 21:23.444
I actually know a lot
about this business.

21:23.496 --> 21:24.546
Okay, I said I'm sorry--

21:24.614 --> 21:25.975
And I know more than enough
to know

21:26.015 --> 21:27.749
that that looks like
every other proposal

21:27.817 --> 21:29.084
that's comes across my desk.

21:29.151 --> 21:30.911
Well, that gives me
a shit load of confidence

21:30.919 --> 21:32.053
going into this meeting.

21:32.104 --> 21:33.455
I'm not trying to
destroy your confidence.

21:33.522 --> 21:34.789
That's the one thing you have
going for you.

21:34.857 --> 21:36.057
Then what are you
trying to do?

21:36.125 --> 21:37.275
Mike, you're not here

21:37.360 --> 21:38.927
because you crunched
Sidwell some numbers.

21:38.995 --> 21:41.096
You're here because
you solved a problem for him.

21:44.517 --> 21:45.517
All right.

21:45.518 --> 21:46.885
Get rid of this,
and bring--

21:46.969 --> 21:49.170
And bring you everything
I can find on Tony Gianopolous.

21:49.171 --> 21:51.473
On it.

21:51.524 --> 21:52.524
Amy.

21:54.343 --> 21:55.343
Why aren't you--

21:55.344 --> 21:56.344
Why am I an assistant

21:56.345 --> 21:58.012
and not an investment banker?

21:58.064 --> 21:59.948
I'm getting my PhD
in psychology.

22:00.015 --> 22:02.850
Money bores me.

22:02.902 --> 22:04.903
I don't know why you needed
to talk to me in chambers,

22:04.987 --> 22:06.154
Mr. Malone.

22:06.205 --> 22:07.372
I was clear on my ruling.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.207
Well, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

22:09.291 --> 22:11.211
your ruling didn't cover
the fact that the S.E.C.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.128
has a vendetta
against Pearson Specter.

22:13.195 --> 22:14.512
That's a serious accusation.

22:14.597 --> 22:15.747
And if it were the truth,

22:15.831 --> 22:17.399
he would have said it
out there, not in here.

22:17.466 --> 22:18.733
I'm doing it in private, Sean,

22:18.801 --> 22:20.535
because I don't want to slander
an entire department

22:20.603 --> 22:21.736
based on the actions
of two men.

22:21.804 --> 22:22.971
Translation?

22:23.039 --> 22:24.539
He doesn't want to be
charged with perjury

22:24.607 --> 22:26.024
because he's lying,
and this is a joke.

22:26.108 --> 22:27.442
It wasn't a joke
when I was asked

22:27.493 --> 22:29.577
to do the exact same thing
that he's doing right now.

22:29.645 --> 22:31.045
What the hell
are you talking about?

22:31.063 --> 22:32.414
Before I left the S.E.C.,

22:32.481 --> 22:34.582
I was told to target
Pearson Specter clients.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.217
- And who exactly told you?
- Brian Harris.

22:36.285 --> 22:37.452
Then go after him,

22:37.520 --> 22:38.953
'cause all you've got on me
is hearsay,

22:39.021 --> 22:40.755
and might I point this is
the accusation of a man

22:40.823 --> 22:42.807
who is about to be fired,
which I'd say should be taken

22:42.892 --> 22:44.192
with a cubic meter of salt.

22:44.243 --> 22:46.161
Well, that cubic meter of salt

22:46.228 --> 22:47.748
might actually
get a little bit smaller

22:47.763 --> 22:49.497
if Sean here were to, say,
open up his files

22:49.565 --> 22:50.965
and show us his paper trail.

22:51.033 --> 22:53.635
Our work product is covered
under federal regulation,

22:53.703 --> 22:54.936
and he knows that.

22:55.003 --> 22:56.723
I also know you're hiding
behind your office

22:56.739 --> 22:57.772
and using his court to do it.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.290
All right, all right,
that's enough.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.709
Mr. Malone,
I don't appreciate you

23:00.776 --> 23:01.743
using my chambers to testify,

23:01.794 --> 23:03.128
and he may not have proof,

23:03.212 --> 23:06.280
but if one client
leaves his firm

23:06.332 --> 23:08.116
and their charges
miraculously disappear,

23:08.552 --> 23:10.052
you're looking at more
than sanctions.

23:10.137 --> 23:12.472
You're looking at jail time.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.811
Thank you.

23:18.862 --> 23:20.313
Rachel?

23:20.364 --> 23:21.531
It's only been a day.

23:21.615 --> 23:23.316
You already have a suggestion
for my new deal?

23:23.367 --> 23:24.750
- I do.
- Good.

23:24.818 --> 23:26.752
Then which of those five
companies should I go after?

23:26.820 --> 23:28.171
None of them.

23:28.255 --> 23:29.739
So you brought me nothing?

23:29.823 --> 23:31.991
No, I brought you
five better options.

23:32.058 --> 23:33.938
- What's wrong with the op--
- Just take a look.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.034
These companies
have no disposable assets.

23:42.102 --> 23:44.336
No, they don't.
They have underperforming assets

23:44.388 --> 23:46.388
that can be turned around
and built into something.

23:46.390 --> 23:47.940
Did you even look into
the companies I gave you?

23:48.008 --> 23:49.692
- Yes, I did, but I--
- But what?

23:49.776 --> 23:51.160
Sounds like someone's
been drinking

23:51.245 --> 23:53.029
her boyfriend's kool-aid.
Maybe if more people did,

23:53.113 --> 23:54.831
there just might be--
God damn it, Rachel,

23:54.915 --> 23:56.749
I'm not in business
to save the world.

23:56.816 --> 23:58.317
I asked for
a professional opinion.

23:58.385 --> 24:00.253
And I gave you
a professional opinion.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.121
You just don't like it.
No, I don't.

24:02.172 --> 24:04.006
And now we're gonna have to work
all day tomorrow

24:04.091 --> 24:05.791
to do what I asked you to do
in the first place.

24:05.843 --> 24:07.126
You mean
spend all day together.

24:07.177 --> 24:08.577
- If that's what it takes.
- Mm-hmm.

24:08.595 --> 24:10.129
Did you call this board meeting

24:10.180 --> 24:11.820
just so we could
spend more time together?

24:11.849 --> 24:13.489
Did you bring me deals
you knew I'd reject

24:13.517 --> 24:14.634
just to avoid it?

24:16.603 --> 24:19.004
Look, like I said,

24:19.056 --> 24:20.673
I have a meeting on Friday,

24:20.724 --> 24:22.007
and I need to be
prepared for it,

24:22.059 --> 24:23.676
so maybe you should
go back to your office,

24:23.727 --> 24:24.861
get cracking,

24:24.945 --> 24:27.063
and just give me a call
when you have something.

24:29.867 --> 24:31.200
Okay.

24:35.355 --> 24:38.124
You're kidding me.

24:38.191 --> 24:39.709
So this is all mine?

24:39.793 --> 24:41.627
Yup.

24:41.695 --> 24:43.462
In 20 days, the public access
will be gone,

24:43.530 --> 24:46.866
and you will have yourself
1/4 mile of private beach.

24:46.934 --> 24:48.568
What about
the Southampton city council?

24:48.635 --> 24:49.969
What about them?

24:50.037 --> 24:52.722
They're a bunch of
public-access loving assholes.

24:52.806 --> 24:57.677
Like I said,
what about them?

24:57.728 --> 24:59.712
How'd you do this, Mike?

24:59.763 --> 25:01.430
Well, the question isn't
how I did it,

25:01.515 --> 25:02.982
it's why I did it.

25:03.049 --> 25:05.484
Oh.
You want something from me.

25:05.552 --> 25:07.486
Just your consideration.

25:07.554 --> 25:09.906
Well, you've earned it.
Go ahead.

25:18.198 --> 25:19.699
Not interested.

25:22.035 --> 25:23.502
You didn't even look at it.

25:23.570 --> 25:25.438
Oh, I don't have to.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.808
You just said that I earned
your consideration.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.876
Mm-hmm,
and you just got it.

25:32.296 --> 25:35.264
Gillis industries
is ripe for a turnaround,

25:35.349 --> 25:37.850
and I already own 7%.
Congratulations.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.936
Now go beg someone else
for money,

25:40.020 --> 25:41.387
because you're not
getting mine.

25:41.438 --> 25:42.972
I don't understand.

25:43.056 --> 25:44.123
You don't have to.

25:44.191 --> 25:45.775
Now get the hell
out of my office.

25:45.859 --> 25:47.860
- Mr. Gianopolous.
- I said get the hell out.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.154
Hey, Mike.
How's it going?

25:58.238 --> 25:59.455
Fancy meeting you here.

26:03.877 --> 26:05.328
It was you.

26:05.412 --> 26:07.446
What was me?

26:07.497 --> 26:11.500
I'm just here to thank you
for the advice you once gave me.

26:11.585 --> 26:13.252
You know,
back when we were friends.

26:15.505 --> 26:16.505
- Louis.
- No, no, no.

26:16.506 --> 26:17.807
No, no, no.

26:17.891 --> 26:19.925
You once told me that
my actions had consequences.

26:19.977 --> 26:21.227
Remember?

26:21.294 --> 26:23.262
Your actions yesterday
have consequences too.

26:23.313 --> 26:25.514
What did you say
to Gianopolous?

26:25.599 --> 26:26.766
Not much.

26:26.817 --> 26:28.634
Just that you were
the person responsible

26:28.685 --> 26:29.635
for his number two
leaving him.

26:29.686 --> 26:30.686
I was responsible?

26:30.687 --> 26:31.804
He agreed to it.

26:31.855 --> 26:33.216
But what he didn't know
was is that

26:33.273 --> 26:35.274
it was his own lawyer
who came up with the idea.

26:35.325 --> 26:36.542
Now he does.

26:36.610 --> 26:38.444
- And what does that--
- Have to do with it?

26:38.495 --> 26:40.196
He may have agreed to it,

26:40.280 --> 26:41.814
but it was a betrayal by you.

26:41.865 --> 26:43.199
And here's a little something

26:43.283 --> 26:46.252
you obviously do not know
about investment banking.

26:46.319 --> 26:49.338
The only thing more satisfying
to these guys than money

26:49.423 --> 26:52.591
is sticking it to someone
who stuck it to them.

26:59.349 --> 27:00.383
Louis.

27:03.353 --> 27:04.887
I'm sorry for hurting you
with Sheila.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.606
Don't you ever mention
her name to me again.

27:07.674 --> 27:10.810
Okay,
but it was a move,

27:10.861 --> 27:11.861
like you just did.

27:11.862 --> 27:14.113
So can we move on?

27:14.180 --> 27:17.199
Move on?

27:17.284 --> 27:21.404
You used the woman I love
to extend your goddamn T.R.O.

27:21.488 --> 27:25.741
You knew how I felt about her,
and you did it anyway.

27:25.826 --> 27:28.794
I will never, ever forget it
until the day I die.

27:28.862 --> 27:30.963
Good luck beating Harvey
without money.

27:37.012 --> 27:38.099
I have good news.

27:38.671 --> 27:40.389
James Dolan died
and left me the Knicks?

27:40.473 --> 27:42.641
Louis stopped Mike
from getting Gianopolous.

27:42.709 --> 27:44.009
He blocked his funding.

27:44.077 --> 27:45.077
Good.

27:50.783 --> 27:52.351
You went to Louis
with a problem,

27:52.418 --> 27:53.418
he fixed it,

27:53.486 --> 27:55.020
and all you're gonna say
is "good"?

27:55.088 --> 27:56.528
Donna, I'm glad
he fixed the problem,

27:56.589 --> 27:58.390
but it was a problem
he created.

27:58.458 --> 27:59.458
He created it because

27:59.509 --> 28:00.892
when it comes to people
he cares about,

28:00.960 --> 28:02.627
Louis has a blind spot.

28:02.679 --> 28:05.364
Yeah, for people and cats
and who knows what else?

28:05.431 --> 28:07.132
I'll tell you what else.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.034
He cares about you.

28:11.104 --> 28:12.504
What do you want from me,
Donna?

28:12.572 --> 28:15.173
I want you to tell him
he did a good job.

28:15.241 --> 28:17.476
I'll tell him
when we come out on top.

28:17.543 --> 28:18.677
Okay, Harvey.

28:18.744 --> 28:20.629
You do what you're gonna do,

28:20.713 --> 28:21.747
but just remember,

28:21.814 --> 28:23.615
when Louis asked Sheila
to marry him,

28:23.683 --> 28:25.884
you were the one he picked
to be his best man,

28:25.952 --> 28:28.587
and you said yes.

28:39.248 --> 28:41.516
I'm sorry,
but we're not hiring today.

28:41.601 --> 28:42.834
I think you'd be
looking for a job

28:42.885 --> 28:44.302
given the beat-down
you took in chambers.

28:44.354 --> 28:45.503
I'm not sure what

28:45.555 --> 28:47.116
Jeff disgruntled employee here
told you,

28:47.139 --> 28:48.240
but I'm still standing.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.542
Well, what I told her
is that you lost.

28:50.609 --> 28:51.609
Then why are you here?

28:51.677 --> 28:53.111
We're here to make you
an offer.

28:53.179 --> 28:54.546
You drop all seven cases,

28:54.597 --> 28:56.365
we drop the malicious
prosecution claim.

28:56.449 --> 28:57.866
No deal.

28:57.950 --> 29:00.652
Judge Hopkins is going to be
waiting for you to take action.

29:00.703 --> 29:02.454
Too much time goes by,

29:02.505 --> 29:03.955
he's gonna think
you're full of shit.

29:04.006 --> 29:05.257
But if you fold right now,

29:05.308 --> 29:06.591
he's only gonna sanction you

29:06.659 --> 29:08.393
for the exact claim
that we're willing to drop.

29:08.444 --> 29:09.928
Which is why
we'll tell the judge

29:09.996 --> 29:11.837
that in exchange for those
cases being dropped,

29:11.864 --> 29:13.865
we'll give the S.E.C.
unprecedented access

29:13.916 --> 29:15.217
to our clients' books.

29:15.301 --> 29:18.436
Which, of course,
you won't be doing.

29:18.488 --> 29:19.704
No, we won't.

29:19.772 --> 29:21.540
So what exactly
am I getting out of this?

29:21.607 --> 29:22.741
You get to save face.

29:22.792 --> 29:23.792
I do like my face.

29:23.793 --> 29:25.127
However, I also like my ass,

29:25.211 --> 29:27.162
which will be on the line
if I take this deal.

29:27.246 --> 29:30.582
Then you have 24 hours to
decide which one you like more.

29:37.289 --> 29:38.974
Mr. Forstman, Mike Ross.

29:39.058 --> 29:40.926
No.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.594
Sir, I think that
if you hear me out--

29:42.645 --> 29:45.664
How the hell
did you find me here?

29:45.731 --> 29:47.365
The article in <i>Forbes</i> said

29:47.417 --> 29:48.800
you can't go more
than three hours

29:48.868 --> 29:50.836
without Rosa's cafe cubanos.

29:50.887 --> 29:53.305
That article in <i>Forbes</i>
was six years ago.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.240
It also said you never change.

29:55.307 --> 29:56.575
Did you also read where I have

29:56.642 --> 29:58.660
every Bud Fox wannabe dumped
in a local landfill?

29:58.744 --> 30:00.178
If you do that,

30:00.246 --> 30:03.515
you'll miss the opportunity
to get back at Harvey Specter.

30:06.452 --> 30:07.852
And what does
a little shit like you

30:07.870 --> 30:09.454
know about Harvey Specter?

30:09.505 --> 30:11.489
I know that he bought that
'63 Aston Martin

30:11.541 --> 30:13.492
out from under you,
and you've hated him ever since.

30:13.559 --> 30:15.260
You know he keeps it
in a garage?

30:15.311 --> 30:16.394
Doesn't even drive it.

30:16.446 --> 30:17.446
What do you want?

30:21.551 --> 30:22.751
Gillis Industries.

30:22.835 --> 30:24.553
Gillis Industries...

30:24.637 --> 30:27.138
Is a black hole
of distressed debt.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.206
I want nothing to do with it.

30:28.274 --> 30:29.174
No, it isn't.

30:29.242 --> 30:31.376
It's a '63 Aston Martin.

30:34.747 --> 30:35.747
Who do you work for?

30:35.781 --> 30:37.265
Who says I work for anyone?

30:37.350 --> 30:38.483
Because a young kid like you

30:38.551 --> 30:41.486
with enough clout
to go after Gillis...

30:41.537 --> 30:42.854
I'd know you.

30:42.922 --> 30:44.823
I work for Jonathan Sidwell.

30:44.891 --> 30:48.527
Okay. You've got
my 230 mil.

30:50.146 --> 30:52.531
I only need 80.

30:52.582 --> 30:54.866
You don't know what you need.

30:57.220 --> 30:58.904
What happens to the company
is my call.

30:58.971 --> 31:00.422
Done.

31:05.478 --> 31:08.013
Oh, one more thing,
when you get those papers.

31:09.982 --> 31:12.067
I have a feeling there'll be
a provision buried in there

31:12.151 --> 31:14.686
that says that
once the deal closes,

31:14.737 --> 31:16.721
you cut Sidwell out.

31:16.772 --> 31:18.323
I'm sorry, what?

31:18.390 --> 31:19.691
I don't know him,

31:19.742 --> 31:21.559
and I want need him
sucking a chunk out of a deal

31:21.611 --> 31:23.695
that can't happen without me.

31:36.876 --> 31:38.176
Well?

31:38.244 --> 31:39.678
He went for it.

31:39.745 --> 31:40.795
That is great.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.847
No, it's not all great.

31:42.915 --> 31:46.251
He'll only give me the money
if I agree to cut out Sidwell.

31:46.302 --> 31:47.302
What?

31:47.386 --> 31:49.854
What does cut him out
even mean?

31:49.922 --> 31:51.206
It means make sure Sidwell

31:51.290 --> 31:53.091
doesn't get a penny
from this deal.

31:53.158 --> 31:56.595
Mike, the second he finds
that out, you're gone.

31:56.662 --> 31:58.880
He's not gonna find out
until the deal closes,

31:58.965 --> 32:01.366
and if I don't find the money,
I'm out of a job anyway.

32:01.434 --> 32:04.553
Oh, I get it.

32:04.637 --> 32:06.838
At least this way, you get to
leave on the winning side.

32:06.839 --> 32:09.908
- We leave on the winning side.
- Who says I'm gonna do that?

32:11.761 --> 32:13.922
What happened to, "you think
I'm staying if you leave"?

32:13.980 --> 32:14.980
Yeah, that was before I knew

32:15.047 --> 32:16.214
you were gonna screw over
Sidwell.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.016
- Amy, I--
- No, he may be

32:18.067 --> 32:19.651
a dick sometimes,
but he's the reason you're here.

32:19.702 --> 32:22.537
You think I want this?

32:22.622 --> 32:23.955
I have to make a choice between

32:24.006 --> 32:25.473
the promise I made
to Walter Gillis

32:25.558 --> 32:26.725
and what I owe Jonathan.

32:26.792 --> 32:28.526
Mike, Walter Gillis
doesn't give a shit

32:28.594 --> 32:29.675
about that promise anymore.

32:29.695 --> 32:30.979
Yeah, but I do,

32:31.063 --> 32:32.964
and so do all the people
that work for him.

32:35.501 --> 32:38.003
So you're gonna do it.

32:40.056 --> 32:41.706
I don't know.

32:41.757 --> 32:44.859
But I do know that I keep
having to do shity things

32:44.944 --> 32:46.477
just to win this thing,

32:46.529 --> 32:48.529
but I'm gonna go make up
for one of them right now.

32:54.387 --> 32:57.589
I'm sorry I didn't do
what you asked me to do.

32:57.657 --> 32:59.391
I should have evaluated
your ideas.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.226
You should have,

33:01.294 --> 33:02.560
but I should have remembered

33:02.628 --> 33:05.213
that you don't always do
what people expect of you.

33:05.298 --> 33:07.498
You mean what people
tell me to do.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.467
I chose the nicer version.

33:09.518 --> 33:11.169
Well, I, um...

33:11.220 --> 33:13.188
I finished what I should
have done in the first place.

33:13.272 --> 33:15.139
- And?
- And let's go through them.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.244
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

33:19.295 --> 33:20.578
I figured if I tried
to go upstairs,

33:20.630 --> 33:21.913
you'd have me killed.

33:21.964 --> 33:23.448
Oh, is that a joke,
'cause I'm not laughing.

33:23.499 --> 33:24.966
Louis, I didn't say it
right the first time.

33:25.051 --> 33:27.052
I want to say it again.
I'm sorry.

33:28.988 --> 33:30.939
You think "I'm sorry"
makes up for what you did?

33:31.023 --> 33:33.325
No, but I'm hoping
that we can move past it

33:33.376 --> 33:35.210
and be friends again.

33:35.294 --> 33:37.045
Well, the only problem
with that is,

33:37.129 --> 33:38.880
is that you and I both know
that you're only here

33:38.964 --> 33:40.404
because I took away
your sugar daddy,

33:40.416 --> 33:41.900
and now you want me
to take it easy on you.

33:41.967 --> 33:44.486
Louis, if you don't want to
accept my apology, that's fine,

33:44.570 --> 33:46.237
but I'm not here
from a position of weakness.

33:46.305 --> 33:47.745
I'm here from
a position of strength.

33:47.773 --> 33:49.107
Bullshit.
Where'd you get money?

33:49.158 --> 33:50.342
You don't have any friends
out there.

33:50.409 --> 33:52.711
No, but Harvey has enemies.

33:52.762 --> 33:54.429
What's that supposed to mean?

33:54.513 --> 33:55.913
You told me
these guys hold grudges.

33:55.931 --> 33:58.233
I just found a guy
with one against Harvey.

33:58.317 --> 33:59.351
You son of a bitch.

33:59.402 --> 34:00.735
You didn't come here
to apologize.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.181
You came here
to rub it in my face.

34:02.188 --> 34:03.905
Oh, and I bet you just
can't wait to tell Harvey

34:03.989 --> 34:05.509
that I'm the one
who gave you the idea.

34:05.591 --> 34:06.958
Louis, I wasn't even
gonna tell you

34:07.009 --> 34:07.959
how I got the idea at all.

34:08.010 --> 34:09.159
I'm still not gonna tell Harvey.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.428
Because you want me
to owe you?

34:10.496 --> 34:11.936
Because I'm not
as much of an asshole

34:11.964 --> 34:13.598
as you think I am.

34:13.649 --> 34:16.150
- What about a buyout?
- Never gonna happen.

34:16.235 --> 34:17.902
He's got a golden parachute.

34:17.953 --> 34:19.788
Well, then I've got two people
on the board.

34:19.871 --> 34:21.156
I can force a vote.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.108
You do that,
it triggers a stock split.

34:23.175 --> 34:24.496
His shares double
in voting power.

34:24.543 --> 34:26.478
Yours don't.
I mean, that's all five.

34:26.545 --> 34:29.347
None of them work.
No, they don't.

34:29.398 --> 34:31.032
So when you told me
you should have

34:31.117 --> 34:32.350
evaluated my ideas first,

34:32.400 --> 34:33.952
you weren't saying
that they were good.

34:34.018 --> 34:36.221
I was saying
I wasn't doing my job.

34:36.288 --> 34:38.590
Which was to let me
figure out for myself

34:38.641 --> 34:40.058
that my ideas weren't good.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.793
I chose the nicer version.

34:42.862 --> 34:47.614
Logan, there are plenty
of other companies out there.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.033
None that we're gonna find
in time

34:49.101 --> 34:50.301
for my board meeting tomorrow.

34:50.302 --> 34:51.302
- So push it.
- I can't.

34:51.303 --> 34:54.472
I didn't call it.

34:54.540 --> 34:56.141
- And I thought--
- Yeah, I know.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.843
That I only even arranged it
to spend time with you?

34:58.911 --> 35:00.028
You really didn't.

35:00.112 --> 35:02.580
No, and now they're gonna
ask me tomorrow

35:02.648 --> 35:03.915
how Gillis is going,

35:03.982 --> 35:05.917
and I'm gonna have to tell them
we might lose,

35:05.984 --> 35:07.635
and then they're gonna ask me
what else I have,

35:07.720 --> 35:10.188
and I'm gonna have to
tell them nothing.

35:10.255 --> 35:11.556
Or maybe you won't.

35:11.607 --> 35:13.758
I told you,
I'm not in that business.

35:13.826 --> 35:16.261
Then convince the board
that you should be.

35:16.328 --> 35:17.328
Okay.

35:17.329 --> 35:18.329
Go back to your office.

35:18.330 --> 35:19.330
Get your files.

35:19.331 --> 35:20.548
Like you said,

35:20.633 --> 35:24.068
I don't always do
what people expect me to do.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.314
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

35:36.382 --> 35:37.982
Of course.

35:38.050 --> 35:41.619
I heard about what you did
with Gianopolous.

35:41.687 --> 35:43.154
Good job.

35:45.858 --> 35:46.898
I appreciate that, Harvey.

35:46.959 --> 35:48.626
I do.

35:48.694 --> 35:50.595
Um...

35:50.663 --> 35:52.297
But it doesn't matter.

35:52.364 --> 35:55.233
You know,
he went somewhere else.

35:56.335 --> 35:57.602
I know.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.604
He went to Forstman.

35:59.655 --> 36:02.407
I just wanted to tell you
you did a good job anyway.

36:02.475 --> 36:05.176
See, that's the thing.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.098
I didn't.

36:10.182 --> 36:12.684
What are you talking about?

36:16.489 --> 36:17.956
Mike got the idea from me.

36:20.125 --> 36:22.627
What?

36:22.694 --> 36:23.962
How?

36:25.464 --> 36:26.731
When I cut him off
from Gianopolous,

36:26.799 --> 36:28.099
I stuck it in his face,

36:28.167 --> 36:32.854
and I told him that
people hold grudges, and I--

36:32.938 --> 36:34.739
he must have known
your history with Forstman,

36:34.773 --> 36:36.391
and that's why he went to him,
so...

36:41.680 --> 36:42.914
I'm sorry.

36:42.982 --> 36:44.682
God damn it, Louis.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.719
I don't want to keep
being mad at you,

36:47.786 --> 36:50.004
but you keep doing
the same shit.

36:50.089 --> 36:51.890
But, see, this wasn't me
being duped.

36:51.957 --> 36:55.793
No, it was you
letting your emotions

36:55.845 --> 36:58.596
lead you into
doing something stupid.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.849
Again.

37:00.933 --> 37:04.068
You just had to
stick it in his face.

37:04.136 --> 37:07.322
You know what?

37:07.406 --> 37:09.407
I'm done.

37:11.076 --> 37:12.660
It's not fair,
you know.

37:15.414 --> 37:21.286
I'm emotional.
You're cold.

37:21.337 --> 37:24.539
You're loved,

37:24.623 --> 37:26.124
and I'm hated.

37:27.459 --> 37:30.962
Louis, if I was so cold,

37:31.013 --> 37:34.299
I wouldn't have come here
in the first place.

37:45.877 --> 37:47.032
What are you doing?

37:47.093 --> 37:49.694
Pouring us a drink.

37:50.493 --> 37:51.493
Cahill took the deal.

37:51.493 --> 37:53.534
All seven cases
are officially dead.

37:56.121 --> 37:59.840
Jessica, I'm sorry that I didn't
come clean with you before.

38:00.666 --> 38:02.784
Me too.

38:02.835 --> 38:05.387
Lying to you
was a business decision,

38:05.454 --> 38:07.639
and it was wrong,

38:07.723 --> 38:08.924
but I want you to know

38:08.991 --> 38:11.059
that I would never lie to you,
man to woman.

38:12.728 --> 38:14.329
I appreciate that.

38:17.550 --> 38:19.050
We have a problem.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.019
I just got off the phone
with Richard Coleman.

38:21.103 --> 38:22.971
Last week,
Sean Cahill asked him

38:23.022 --> 38:24.856
if I'd ever crossed any lines
in his presence.

38:24.941 --> 38:26.174
Son of a bitch.

38:26.225 --> 38:27.786
He doesn't want our clients
to leave us.

38:27.810 --> 38:29.978
He wants them
to cough up dirt on me.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.180
At least none of them did,
or we'd be in trouble right now.

38:32.248 --> 38:34.516
- How do you want to handle it?
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.

38:34.583 --> 38:36.768
Right now, I've got
something else to do.

38:36.852 --> 38:38.436
Shit.

38:38.521 --> 38:40.855
They wouldn't turn on Harvey.

38:40.907 --> 38:43.091
Cahill wanted us
to drop those cases anyway,

38:43.159 --> 38:44.576
and I just did him a big favor.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.494
You couldn't have known that.

38:46.562 --> 38:48.747
It was my job to know that.

38:54.003 --> 38:55.487
Hey, Mike?

38:55.571 --> 38:57.939
- Yeah.
- Harvey Specter's here to--

38:57.990 --> 39:00.275
- Harvey, what can I do for you?

39:03.246 --> 39:04.847
I wanted to thank you
for the recordings.

39:04.914 --> 39:07.732
Is that why you came
all the way down here?

39:07.817 --> 39:10.085
I came to tell you I think
you're making a big mistake

39:10.152 --> 39:12.320
getting into bed with Forstman.
I knew it.

39:12.371 --> 39:13.822
Mike, you don't know this guy.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.957
You could have thanked me
for those recordings days ago,

39:16.008 --> 39:17.926
but instead you picked
the exact day

39:17.994 --> 39:19.294
that I find a new investor
to show up

39:19.345 --> 39:21.129
with your thank-you
and your friendly advice.

39:21.180 --> 39:22.631
This isn't some move.

39:22.698 --> 39:24.399
- You only make moves.
- Mike.

39:24.450 --> 39:25.483
Hey, tell me right now

39:25.568 --> 39:26.929
that you wouldn't do
the same thing

39:26.936 --> 39:27.869
if you were in my position.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.571
I was.

39:30.623 --> 39:31.623
And I did.

39:31.674 --> 39:33.207
What?

39:33.259 --> 39:35.277
You think our grudge
is about some car?

39:35.344 --> 39:37.062
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:37.146 --> 39:39.648
When I was younger,
I made a shady deal with him,

39:39.715 --> 39:41.533
and I paid for it.
Who says that I'm making-

39:41.617 --> 39:42.784
If you haven't, you will,

39:42.835 --> 39:44.886
because Forstman
doesn't throw money around

39:44.953 --> 39:46.471
without getting something
in return.

39:46.555 --> 39:48.123
He's gonna get money
in return.

39:48.190 --> 39:49.557
Money is third on his list.

39:49.609 --> 39:51.393
The first two
are getting back at people

39:51.444 --> 39:52.560
and getting control of people.

39:52.628 --> 39:53.895
Maybe you should have
thought of that

39:53.946 --> 39:55.897
before you had Louis
cut me off from Gianopolous,

39:55.948 --> 39:58.266
because now I have
no other choice!

40:05.992 --> 40:07.409
You always have a choice.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.553
Here's to turning around
Piedmont Avionics.

40:21.123 --> 40:22.123
What?

40:22.124 --> 40:24.459
Nothing.

40:24.527 --> 40:25.910
What time is it?

40:25.995 --> 40:29.631
Too late for you
to change your mind.

40:29.682 --> 40:32.734
Logan, the board
is going to be wowed.

40:32.801 --> 40:34.635
Well, I wish I had
your confidence.

40:34.687 --> 40:38.156
You are not short
in the confidence department.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.408
Oh, you don't have to
pay me compliments.

40:40.459 --> 40:42.927
I meant it as an insult.

40:43.012 --> 40:45.180
You know, if this law thing
doesn't work out--

40:45.247 --> 40:47.349
Then I could have a career
in venture capital?

40:47.400 --> 40:50.318
No, I was gonna say
you could be my assistant.

40:50.386 --> 40:52.454
Hilarious.

40:52.521 --> 40:55.023
Seriously, Rachel, I--

40:55.091 --> 40:57.042
I couldn't have done it
without you.

40:57.126 --> 40:59.861
Yes, you could have.

40:59.929 --> 41:01.429
It just wouldn't have been
as good.

41:01.497 --> 41:04.065
Humility.

41:04.133 --> 41:05.850
Another thing I love about you.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.720
Logan, I should go.

41:25.788 --> 41:26.938
Rachel, I--

41:27.022 --> 41:28.690
Um...

41:31.327 --> 41:33.061
Good luck tomorrow.
